1
00:00:54.597 --> 00:00:57.391
FOUR FACING THE BANK

2
00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:06.734
Show me the money!

3
00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.196
Come on, that's bullshit!

4
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.533
Take five! What's wrong?

5
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.203
The take was perfect.
- "Show me the money"?


6
00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:20.998
You stole that from Jerry Maguire!
- I was two when it came out.


7
00:01:21.457 --> 00:01:22.458
Okay.

8
00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:25.753
Then say, "Show me the... cash."
Better?


9
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.339
That sucks even more!

10
00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:32.218
That sucks even more than
this shitty movie, and this shitty set!


11
00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:37.056
I know... I know you had a role
in some TV series...


12
00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:41.310
Wait a second, I starred in
the biggest German TV series of all time!


13
00:01:41.477 --> 00:01:43.938
Got it?
- And now you do student shorts


14
00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:46.023
for 100 euros a day.

15
00:01:46.357 --> 00:01:47.817
But you said 200!

16
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.820
That was before I knew
you were a little diva.


17
00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:53.155
You filthy little...

18
00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:58.077
PETER
THE ACTOR


19
00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:10.631
Chris! Chris! Chris!

20
00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.060
CHRIS
THE BOXER


21
00:02:26.897 --> 00:02:31.569
I'm responsible for this agency's
top ten kick-ass ad campaigns!


22
00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.114
That's the way it is.
Remember the Volkswagen campaign?


23
00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.118
That was me!
The Bitburger World Cup spot? Me!


24
00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:42.705
But when it's time
to choose a creative director,


25
00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:46.584
a job I've worked nine years for,
what do you do?


26
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.086
You give it to Gustav!

27
00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:52.006
I'm so sick of this agency!
None of you


28
00:02:52.173 --> 00:02:55.384
ever appreciated my creative vision.
Not one of you.


29
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.053
That's why

30
00:02:58.387 --> 00:03:02.057
I'm going to say something to my bosses
from the bottom of my heart:


31
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.062
Fuck you. Fuck you all!

32
00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:11.358
While you wasted your money
on whores and fast cars...


33
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:15.112
I'm talking to you, Alex.
I was saving my money.


34
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.950
Because I knew that someday
you'd stab me in the back.


35
00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:23.120
And now I'll take my money
and open my own agency.


36
00:03:23.454 --> 00:03:27.082
Then I'm going to crush you.
I'm going to pound you into the ground!


37
00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.210
You're all dead!

38
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.462
Okay, that's enough.

39
00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:32.838
Security!

40
00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.301
Seriously?

41
00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:39.929
I've had 12 years of Karate lessons.

42
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.685
MAX
THE AD MAN


43
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.161
Would you like to open
an investment account?


44
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:05.746
No thanks.

45
00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.581
Are you sure?

46
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.752
Sometimes "no" can also mean "yes,"
or "yes, maybe."


47
00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:16.173
Even though, in most cases,
"no" does mean "no."


48
00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:21.762
Unless of course we were playing
some sort of exciting role game,


49
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:25.557
and we were tied to refrigerators,
for instance.


50
00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:29.687
We'd have safe words
so we'd know that "no" means "yes."


51
00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:33.899
Or that "chocolate pudding"
means "no,"


52
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.861
and "pickles" means "yes."
Do you want an account now?


53
00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:39.947
No.

54
00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:48.372
Pardon me, would you like
to open an investment account?


55
00:04:48.664 --> 00:04:51.917
If you say "pickles"
I'll staple your ears to your balls!


56
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:53.627
Perverted asshole!

57
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.632
TOBIAS
INVESTMENT ADVISOR


58
00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:05.597
Chris!

59
00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:12.438
The kick has to
come right from the hip.

60
00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:15.774
That's right, from the hip.
- Hey, Chris. Over here.


61
00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.153
I'll be right there, ladies.
I'll be right there.


62
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.447
Great job, girls!

63
00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:25.367
On Thursday, I'll be even harder on you.
- The harder, the better.


64
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.671
How long are you going to play this game?
- Game?


65
00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:42.092
Yeah, putting your hands on their hips,
their butts, their breasts...


66
00:05:42.468 --> 00:05:45.846
Hey, I don't touch breasts.
At least not at work.


67
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.724
Come on, Chris.
You can't go on like this.


68
00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:51.894
This is nothing. 
It's just a scratch.

69
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:54.271
That's not what the doctor said.

70
00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:59.109
You can't renew your fighting license.
And your retina is in terrible condition.


71
00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:02.404
A boxer can knock me out,
but not some stupid retina.


72
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.574
I don't need a retina.
I've still got eagle eyes.


73
00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:11.121
That's disinfectant.
- I saw that.


74
00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.999
I've still got women's boxing.
- Yeah,


75
00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:17.628
until your six-pack turns into a beer keg
and your joints give out.


76
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:22.424
Do you think women are still
going to pay you to rook their hips?


77
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:26.303
I may be a little blind,

78
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.348
but I'm not dumb.
Let me show you something.


79
00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:45.280
I hear you scared away another customer.
- I didn't scare her away,


80
00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:49.451
I just don't like to con people
out of their money. It's immoral.


81
00:06:49.785 --> 00:06:52.830
That's the business.
- Yes, according to Schumacher.


82
00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:55.499
The guy's a slimebucket.
- A slimebucket?


83
00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:58.836
He treats our customers like crap,
cheats on his wife,


84
00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:02.840
and promotes his employees based on
breast size, not qualifications.


85
00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:11.014
Thanks, Tobias.
- Sorry. You deserved your breasts...


86
00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.392
I mean, your promotion.

87
00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:17.229
Wanna grab a coffee sometime?

88
00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:21.733
Where you're standing
will be the boxing ring.


89
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.569
The heart of it all.

90
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:27.322
The punching bags will go back there,
and the speed bags, you know?


91
00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:31.660
And the lockers will go over there,
like in Mickey's Gym.


92
00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:35.789
Mickey's Gym?
- From Rocky, with Sylvester Stallone.


93
00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:40.502
The mats go over there,
with weights and a place to jump rope.


94
00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:46.300
How can you afford all this?
- I've saved money all my life.


95
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.595
I invested my money really well,
and tomorrow


96
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.390
it's finally going to pay off.
I'll sign the contract,


97
00:07:53.724 --> 00:07:56.143
and live my dream.

98
00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:02.483
You dreamer.

99
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:06.695
What are you going to put down there?
- Oh, that'll be a sauna.


100
00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.448
A sauna?
- Yeah. I'll show you.


101
00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:14.369
I have to think
of my female clients too, after all.


102
00:08:17.581 --> 00:08:20.792
Can't you think of me for a second?
- Yes, of course.


103
00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:28.300
Can you spit that out, please?
- Oh yeah.


104
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.929
I'll chew it later.
- Chris?


105
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:34.765
Can we skip foreplay today?
- Okay.


106
00:08:34.932 --> 00:08:37.809
I have to get home.
It's my husband's birthday.


107
00:08:53.909 --> 00:08:56.995
Why is this door closed?
- Because of... flies.


108
00:08:57.538 --> 00:08:59.164
Flies?
- Yes.


109
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.960
Tiny little flies flying in and out,
the little rascals.


110
00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:06.797
Tobias?
Do you know how many banks I supervise?


111
00:09:07.798 --> 00:09:09.716
Nine. Nine banks.

112
00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:15.472
I've got investment advisors shitting
heaps of money in eight of those banks.


113
00:09:16.265 --> 00:09:19.977
But in the ninth bank,
the investment advisor is a real loser.


114
00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.063
I mean an all-round loser.

115
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.275
Yeah, the guy doesn't even have friends.

116
00:09:27.109 --> 00:09:30.362
And between us,
I think he's still a virgin.


117
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:33.740
Oh, God!
He sounds like a real zero.


118
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.410
Tobias?

119
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.495
I'm talking about you.

120
00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:41.873
I've had lots of sex.

121
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.667
Heaps of sex.

122
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.963
Well, I mean not so much...

123
00:09:48.297 --> 00:09:51.133
but I've got this problem...

124
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:54.219
with nudity.
I don't like being naked.


125
00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:57.556
But I've set my sights on somebody,
and...


126
00:09:57.973 --> 00:10:00.183
I just don't want to rush her...

127
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.644
My father probably hired you

128
00:10:02.978 --> 00:10:05.981
because he thought you were
a wiz with numbers,


129
00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:09.901
but you're only an expert
in one number: zero.


130
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:15.490
At least I always break even.
I'm cautious with my client's accounts...


131
00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.911
I've got it!
Why don't you become a math teacher?


132
00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:21.955
Tons of vacation, no stress.

133
00:10:22.289 --> 00:10:26.460
I'm not resigning, and you can't fire me
for no reason. It's in my contract.


134
00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:32.466
Mr Schumacher, I didn't get
the market report for today.


135
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.094
If there are any big changes
in the market,


136
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.472
I need to know that for my clients.

137
00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:41.350
Call the head office.
It's probably a glitch.


138
00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:44.853
I already called four times.
They won't return my calls.


139
00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.359
They disrespected me.
What do you expect?


140
00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.070
I expect you to apologize.

141
00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:56.948
Get on your knees and beg for your job!
- Forget it. No way.


142
00:10:57.282 --> 00:11:00.077
Your temper gets the best of you.
- Don't forget,


143
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.830
I had to pull a lot of strings
to get you a job in that agency.


144
00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:07.042
And I've worked my ass off for them
for nine years!


145
00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:11.004
They're nothing without me!
- No, you're nothing without them!


146
00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.509
I'm not helping you again.
- I don't need your help.


147
00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:18.136
I've saved up some money:100,000 euros.

148
00:11:18.303 --> 00:11:20.806
I'm going to use it
to open my own agency.


149
00:11:24.226 --> 00:11:27.437
"Chris's Boxing Joint."
Man, that sounds fancy!


150
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.330
Are you trying to get killed?
- I can see the headline:

153
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.132
Hi, cuties.
- Hi, Papa.


154
00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:57.968
I left you some scrambled eggs.
- Okay, bye!


155
00:11:58.135 --> 00:12:01.847
Remember to pay the heating bill.
- Pay the heating bill, got it.

BAERENBANK AG

157
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:14.109
ACCOUNT NUMBER

158
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.319
So...

159
00:12:16.987 --> 00:12:19.030
Time to put the cash

160
00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:21.283
in my pocket.

161
00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.202
Here's proof,
if you don't believe me.


162
00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:27.497
Take a look.
- 272 euros?


163
00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:32.502
Mom, that's 6,800 shares of...
- Rotary Global? -Yup.


164
00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:35.172
Whatever it is,
at four cents a share


165
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:38.925
that makes 272 euros.
- Are you fucking kidding me?


166
00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.903
Tobias Bluemel!
- Bluemel!


167
00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:00.030
Calm down, gentlemen.

168
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:04.910
I want to talk to my investment advisor!
- We want to talk to Bluemel!


169
00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:09.122
He's a fraud!
- Bluemel! Show yourself, coward!


170
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.668
I don't know what...
- Oh, these things happen.


171
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.464
Too bad the board doesn't like it

172
00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:21.927
when one of our employees gambles away
the life savings of his clients.


173
00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:25.639
I didn't gamble anything,
I just didn't get the emails.


174
00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:28.225
Oh right, the glitch.

175
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.603
No, look at this.
There's nothing there.


176
00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:33.647
See? Nothing.

177
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:38.276
The market reports!
Suddenly they're all there!


178
00:13:38.777 --> 00:13:42.239
Oh man.
It breaks my heart, Tobias,


179
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:45.784
but I have to ask
for your immediate resignation.


180
00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.664
You did this.
You did this.


181
00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:54.000
That's despicable!
You're scum!


182
00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:58.463
You're a monster!
Those men trusted me, they trusted us!


183
00:13:58.797 --> 00:14:01.925
They trusted us with their savings!
And you just let...


184
00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:04.719
let, let, let them lose it!

185
00:14:14.646 --> 00:14:16.898
Wow, I'm impressed, Tobias!

186
00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:19.192
You've got talent!

187
00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:22.362
I don't mean to be fussy,

188
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:24.948
but Heidi's nipples are oval,

189
00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:28.493
and she trims her bush
into a landing strip.


190
00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.830
Like this. Yeah.

191
00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:36.042
She's an incredible girl.
I think she'll look good in your office.


192
00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:41.423
I want you out of here in an hour,
got it?


193
00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:43.216
And Tobias,

194
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.594
leave us a few drawings.

195
00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.352
Assholes!
- Get out of here! -Bastard!


196
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:58.398
Or we'll call the cops!
- You're bastards! Fucking bastards!


197
00:14:58.732 --> 00:15:00.483
Get lost!
- Fuckers!


198
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.485
Let's get a drink.

199
00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:15.123
The bank always wins.
- I could've bought a kick-ass car,


200
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.461
kick-ass clothes, a kick-ass new retina.
- I'll never apologize. Never!


201
00:15:19.794 --> 00:15:22.422
Freddie always believed in me.
No matter what.


202
00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:24.674
She always believed in me.

203
00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:28.762
And now she believes we've got savings.
- I won't crawl back to them!


204
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.600
That account has been empty for a year.
I couldn't land a single job!


205
00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.103
I could've been a pimp, but no!
I had to save up!


206
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.274
I'm not even a boxer anymore.
I'm blind, burned out and drunk.


207
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:44.611
She'll leave me.
She'll take the kids, and...


208
00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.281
The bank always wins.
- My dad never trusted them.


209
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:51.326
You know where he hid his money?
In the litter box.


210
00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:53.745
But the cats shit in there.
- Yup.


211
00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:57.165
The bank always wins.
- Are you a broken record or what?


212
00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:59.376
The bank always wins.

213
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:03.797
If I ever see that advisor again...
- Tobias Bluemel.


214
00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:07.550
Bluemel, Tobias.
Fuckface Bluemel.


215
00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:10.637
There he is.
- Fuckface!


216
00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:15.642
I'll beat the shit out of you!

217
00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:19.229
If I ever...
- Hey, don't break my cellphone, too!


218
00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:23.316
I'd do it real clean,
with no evidence or suspects.


219
00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:27.070
How?
- First...


220
00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:30.657
I'd stick little tacks in his eyeballs,

221
00:16:31.241 --> 00:16:35.161
And then I'd rip the hair off his balls
with packing tape.


222
00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.080
That hurts like hell.

223
00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:41.376
And when he's lying there,
naked and blind like a little baby bird,


224
00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:45.588
I'd drive a steam-roller over him,
again and again. Back and forth.


225
00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:52.721
And when his entrails are flat
and his intestines are bulging out,


226
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:56.850
I'd dissolve him with acid.
I saw that on CSI once.


227
00:16:57.308 --> 00:17:00.729
Caustic, high-quality acid,
till there's nothing left of him.


228
00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:04.065
Not even a little pile of shit!

229
00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.736
Holy crap! Pinch me!

230
00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:17.912
I said "pinch," you freak!
- Oh, man!


231
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:21.916
That's fuckface!

232
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.586
I'm gonna beat him up!
- He's mine!


233
00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:28.298
We'll go straight to jail
if we whack him here.


234
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.221
See you soon, Bluemel.

235
00:18:17.222 --> 00:18:19.724
The door's reinforced.
- I'll do it, fool.


236
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.769
That's how I do it too.
- Sure.


237
00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:26.147
We're Jehovah's Witnesses.

238
00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:29.192
Hey, not so fast!

239
00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:37.909
Shut the hell up
or I'll bite off your tongue, got it?


240
00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:43.414
Good, then we can begin.

241
00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:48.711
Do you know who we are?
- He asked if you know who we are!


242
00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:55.301
What'?
Take that thing out of his mouth.


243
00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:59.430
One wrong word
and your Wiener is toxic waste!


244
00:19:00.974 --> 00:19:03.893
Podolski!
Juergen Podolski!


245
00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:07.188
The fastest colt in West Germany!
- Colt?


246
00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.399
How did you...

247
00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:13.278
I got every episode of
Bullet & Podolski on DVD. Look!


248
00:19:13.945 --> 00:19:16.406
He's right! You're that actor!

249
00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:18.658
You're that actor!

250
00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.286
Okay. Yes, I am.

251
00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:23.204
What actor?

252
00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:26.958
Lukas Podolski!
- The soccer player? -No!


253
00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:31.546
Commissar Juergen Podolski!
How did I not realize it was you?


254
00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:34.966
We only talked on the phone.
- I never watched it.


255
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.846
You were really famous. What happened?
- I'm still an actor, yeah?


256
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.725
I've got class. I turn down shitty jobs.
- I have to say,


257
00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:47.812
you were much better than Bullet.
- Bullet was a total phony.


258
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:51.232
He went on to Hollywood.
He was totally overrated!


259
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:54.652
Season 3, episode 12:
The Stripper, Drug Ring Crash.


260
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.532
That was world class acting.
- Yes, it was an intense period for me.


261
00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.327
I went undercover for four days
to prepare.


262
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.663
Yes, it was so authentic!
Your talent is...


263
00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:10.251
Can we get back to the task at hand?
- Let the man finish!


264
00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:13.338
"My talent is..."
- Your talent is...


265
00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:16.549
"My talent..." Over here.
"My talent is..."


266
00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:19.719
Oscar-worthy! Oscar-worthy!

267
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:24.807
Tobias, I want you to know

268
00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.393
that this is your last day

269
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.064
on planet Earth.
I'm going to dissect you.


270
00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.107
Piece by piece.

271
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:36.611
And the last thing I'll do
is cut off your balls,


272
00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:41.074
stick them in a jar and put them
on the shelf with your collection.


273
00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.493
He's bluffing, right?
- I think so.


274
00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:46.037
I'm innocent, really!
I, I...


275
00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:50.792
I only wanted the best for my clients!
I mean, I'm not perfect.


276
00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:55.213
Once I took a soda from the machine
because it was lying there,


277
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.550
and I make nude drawings of my colleague,
but that's it!


278
00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:02.053
What'? Yuck!

279
00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:04.138
Do you jerk off to them?

280
00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:06.599
At your desk?
- No! That's sick!


281
00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.810
He winked!
- I didn't wink.


282
00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:10.979
I saw it too.
You must be lying.


283
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:14.899
Oh, he did it again!
- No, I didn't do anything!


284
00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:17.610
I really am a good guy!

285
00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:19.988
I'm Tinkerbell, and that's Lady Di.

286
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.826
So, I've heard enough!
Time to kiss your balls goodbye!


287
00:21:38.172 --> 00:21:41.217
You killed him!
- What? I didn't touch him!


288
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:44.637
You're my witnesses!
The chair jumped with him on it!


289
00:21:58.026 --> 00:22:00.403
Does anybody know CPR?
- Yeah.


290
00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:03.948
He can't breathe. 
Unbutton his shirt.

291
00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.327
Stop! Stop! Not naked!

292
00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.912
Don't undress me!

293
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.209
Do me a favor and just kill me quickly.
I've lost everything as it is.


294
00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.712
What about us?
- It wasn't me!


295
00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:20.715
The bank director sabotaged
your accounts.


296
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:25.470
Now it's your boss's fault?
- Yes, he did it so he could fire me!


297
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.431
He didn't care
if a few clients went bankrupt.


298
00:22:28.765 --> 00:22:31.142
I'll knock him out!
- Not with us!


299
00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:35.521
If that's true, why don't you go
to the police and tell them your version?


300
00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:37.857
Who will they believe?

301
00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:41.361
Schumacher, the director
of 9 profitable German banks,


302
00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:44.113
or me?
- The guy who spanks his monkey at work.


303
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.367
I didn't spank anything!
- Of course you didn't.


304
00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:49.786
Come here, sit up. 
Nice and slow.

305
00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:53.581
You just said "profitable banks."
How profitable are they?


306
00:22:53.956 --> 00:22:57.752
Baerenbank AG is worth about six billion.
- What about in the bank?


307
00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:00.838
Is there a few million
in the building every day?


308
00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:03.758
No, only on Fridays.
Friday is "moving day."


309
00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:07.220
The money is moved to headquarters.
- "Moving day!"


310
00:23:07.512 --> 00:23:10.848
"Moving day?"
- They move the money, lazy eye!


311
00:23:11.182 --> 00:23:13.851
Can the three of us talk'?
- It's hypothetical.


312
00:23:14.018 --> 00:23:16.646
Hypothetical?
- So, what would happen


313
00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:19.148
if a few million went missing?

314
00:23:20.024 --> 00:23:24.821
The bank is insured for things like that.
There would be an investigation.


315
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:27.365
The police would come and ask questions.

316
00:23:27.698 --> 00:23:31.953
So no customers would lose any money?
- No, it's not the Wild West.


317
00:23:32.286 --> 00:23:34.705
It'd be a crime with no victims.

318
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.417
Boys, come with me.

319
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.168
Now.

320
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.182
Are you actually considering this?
- The means justifies the end.


321
00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:57.937
The end justifies the means, idiot!
If it's robbing a bank, then it sucks!


322
00:23:58.104 --> 00:24:01.482
We lost our money
to a corporation we invested in


323
00:24:01.858 --> 00:24:05.361
because we're losers! We're all losers!
I sound like my dad!


324
00:24:05.528 --> 00:24:10.450
So get lost. A few million divided by two
is way more than divided by three!


325
00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:13.369
Or is that wrong?
- No, that's right.


326
00:24:13.536 --> 00:24:16.289
We have to give Tobias a cut.
- The wanker?


327
00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:19.667
We need him. He knows the bank.
He's our insider.


328
00:24:20.126 --> 00:24:23.004
If we really want to rob a bank
we need to be a team


329
00:24:23.129 --> 00:24:26.174
where everyone has a role.
The insider is the key!


330
00:24:26.716 --> 00:24:29.886
How would you know?
- I've caught plenty of bank robbers!


331
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:32.722
On TV, Mr Bullet & Podemski!
On TV!


332
00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:36.350
His name is Commissioner Lukas Podolski!

333
00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:39.061
It's Juergen.
- Whatever!


334
00:24:39.228 --> 00:24:42.064
Show him some respect,
you little snot!


335
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:44.525
This is bullshit. 
Total bullshit!

336
00:24:44.692 --> 00:24:47.862
You know what's bullshit?
My family will have to scrape by.


337
00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:50.865
We'll eat canned ravioli every day

338
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.202
because some banker
decided to fire that jerk-off!


339
00:24:54.368 --> 00:24:57.747
It's bullshit because
I can't pay the fucking heating bill!


340
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:02.919
I want what's mine.
- I want my hard-earned money back.


341
00:25:03.085 --> 00:25:06.506
That's right, Chris.
- Plus a little extra.


342
00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:11.052
For all the psychological stress.
- Sure, we can take as much as we want.


343
00:25:11.385 --> 00:25:14.055
What's the deal?
Are you in, or not?


344
00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:18.476
For the record, this whole thing
makes me very, very nervous.


345
00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:21.729
Duly noted, Goldilocks.

346
00:25:27.902 --> 00:25:29.237
Hey, Tobi!
- Hey!


347
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.781
Time to wake up.
- Come on out.


348
00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:34.992
Careful.
- It's cozy in there, huh?


349
00:25:38.663 --> 00:25:40.665
Careful.

350
00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:46.254
Leave it on.
- Nobody wants to undress you.


351
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.383
I just want to straighten your tie.
- Tobi.


352
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:53.135
Do you mind if I call you Tobi?

353
00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:57.890
You know,
that bank really screwed you over.


354
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.686
How'd you like to even the score?
- And while you're at it,


355
00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:04.230
get yourself a sack full of money?

356
00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:14.365
When do we start?

357
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:16.701
That's our Tobi.

358
00:26:20.371 --> 00:26:23.457
And you play poker?
- Till our finger tips bleed.


359
00:26:24.375 --> 00:26:26.335
I've never seen them.

360
00:26:26.627 --> 00:26:29.213
You married a talented
and well-loved man.


361
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:34.552
Is my little honey bee jealous?
- No way.


362
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.805
It's just weird.

363
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:43.728
We've been married 11 years,
and I've never seen you play poker.


364
00:26:44.061 --> 00:26:46.105
Is it 11 years already?

365
00:26:46.397 --> 00:26:50.067
And you've been acting strange lately.
- How so?


366
00:26:51.068 --> 00:26:54.071
Why did you ask
the heating company for an extension?


367
00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:59.285
Okay, you got me.
It was supposed to be a surprise.


368
00:26:59.619 --> 00:27:02.330
Our investment advisor...

369
00:27:02.747 --> 00:27:05.916
He's just incredible!
He calls me two days ago and says


370
00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.961
the market is...
going through the roof.


371
00:27:09.295 --> 00:27:11.922
We wait a few days, then: jackpot!
It's great, right?


372
00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:13.299
Yeah, great.

373
00:27:17.094 --> 00:27:19.221
Are you hot?

374
00:27:22.058 --> 00:27:23.434
No.

375
00:27:26.646 --> 00:27:30.274
Okay, it's time for a nice round
of Texas shuffle.


376
00:27:31.692 --> 00:27:34.278
You do know it's called
Texas hold 'em, right?


377
00:27:34.487 --> 00:27:37.198
You do know smart asses
get beat up, right?


378
00:27:37.365 --> 00:27:39.241
So, concentrate.

379
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.036
Our bank.
- Where'd you get that?


380
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.081
City hall.
- They just gave it to you?


381
00:27:45.456 --> 00:27:48.334
If the hot secretary
is in your boxing course,


382
00:27:48.668 --> 00:27:51.295
and you really give it to her,
she'll get it for you.


383
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.216
Does it check out?
- It looks right.


384
00:27:55.675 --> 00:27:57.760
Here's the plan: We storm in,

385
00:27:58.928 --> 00:28:02.014
kick the shit out of anybody
who gets in our way,


386
00:28:02.348 --> 00:28:05.226
then we grab the cash.
- That's brilliant!


387
00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:08.896
You make Einstein look like a retard!
- Hey!


388
00:28:10.064 --> 00:28:13.484
Another wisecrack and Einstein
will tack those locks to your ass!


389
00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.654
Your dentures are slipping.
Look! -What?


390
00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:20.574
We'll need the code for the safe room.
It changes daily.


391
00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:24.286
Excuse me?
- Who's got the code?


392
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.956
Ralf, he's the vice manager.

393
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:29.333
That's his office.

394
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:32.586
What does he look like?
- You deaf?


395
00:28:32.962 --> 00:28:36.257
He's about 5 foot 8 inches,
with a button nose, gray hair.


396
00:28:36.424 --> 00:28:38.300
About like this.

397
00:28:38.884 --> 00:28:40.720
He looks like a girl.

398
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.180
Whatever.
Here's the new plan:


399
00:28:43.472 --> 00:28:46.934
We storm in, kick the shit out of Ralf,
get the code,


400
00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:49.353
and then we grab the cash.

401
00:28:50.104 --> 00:28:54.066
Every employee has am alarm button.
If we storm in and crack heads,


402
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.737
they'll call the police.
Maybe we should be more discreet.


403
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.823
Fuck discreet!
- Wait, first thing's first.


404
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.868
We need our roles.
- Keep that up and you'll get fat.


405
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:07.538
Chris, you're the muscle.

406
00:29:08.497 --> 00:29:10.958
Tobias, you're the insider.

407
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.211
As for me, I'm more of a strategist,

408
00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:16.380
so I should be your leader.

409
00:29:17.047 --> 00:29:20.092
Why? Because you're an actor?
- Do you object'?


410
00:29:20.468 --> 00:29:23.763
I think some of us have real experience,
but that's okay.


411
00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:28.517
My talents are always underestimated
by men old enough to be my dad!


412
00:29:29.185 --> 00:29:33.272
I would've had to start pretty early...
- No problem. Let's take a vote.


413
00:29:33.939 --> 00:29:36.525
Who wants me to be the leader?

414
00:29:40.529 --> 00:29:43.949
So, what's my role, great leader?
- You drive the getaway car.


415
00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:47.787
No, forget it.
Rocky can drive the getaway car.


416
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.707
Why me?
- You're belligerent and half blind.


417
00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:56.629
If you mess up and kill somebody,
I'll get arrested for murder too.


418
00:29:56.962 --> 00:30:00.132
And unlike you guys,
I've got my whole life ahead of me.


419
00:30:00.466 --> 00:30:03.093
Don't count on it.
- Do you need glasses to drive?


420
00:30:03.469 --> 00:30:06.013
I don't have glasses.
- I've got glasses.


421
00:30:06.222 --> 00:30:10.059
Okay, fine. But it's gotta go fast.
I needed that money yesterday.


422
00:30:10.392 --> 00:30:14.605
We need to do our homework.
First, we spy on the bank.


423
00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:17.983
I'll get the keys to the bathroom
and the side entrance.


424
00:30:18.317 --> 00:30:21.654
Then we'll do a test run,
and get tools:


425
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:24.990
The getaway car, masks and guns.

426
00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:29.036
What'?
I just binged on the first season


427
00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.705
of Bullet & Podolski again. Crazy!

428
00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:35.167
I never thought
I'd be Podolski's partner.


429
00:30:35.918 --> 00:30:38.504
But we're not using real guns, right?

430
00:30:38.838 --> 00:30:42.174
No, we'll shoot water guns.
- I think we need real guns.


431
00:30:42.508 --> 00:30:44.969
But we'll use blanks.

432
00:30:45.219 --> 00:30:46.804
Here goes.

433
00:31:00.568 --> 00:31:02.403
Morning, Ralf.

434
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:07.324
11 o'clock. On the dot.
- His bowel movements are like clockwork.


435
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.541
11:00 
- RALF IS TAKING A CRAP.

436
00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:35.185
Hey! Tobias!

437
00:32:20.898 --> 00:32:24.026
Susanne!
- Repair service.


438
00:32:24.735 --> 00:32:27.738
You're an angel.
When do you need it back?


439
00:32:27.947 --> 00:32:31.617
No rush. My husband hasn't
played with his tools for years.


440
00:32:31.784 --> 00:32:35.120
He's too busy with his affairs.
- Sounds like true love.


441
00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:38.624
I ignored the first affairs,
but when they hit double digits


442
00:32:38.749 --> 00:32:41.126
I gave up on true love.

443
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:43.796
Yeah.
- Well?


444
00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:45.965
How about a quickie?

445
00:32:46.256 --> 00:32:48.634
I'd love to, but I can't today.

446
00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:52.304
This is more important.
- ls everything okay?


447
00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:55.557
Sort of.
Soon everything will sort of be okay.


448
00:32:56.684 --> 00:32:58.644
I have to get back. Bye!

449
00:33:04.817 --> 00:33:07.361
This is a bank robbery!

450
00:33:08.696 --> 00:33:10.990
Show me the money!

451
00:33:12.574 --> 00:33:15.285
Show me the money!
Come on, people!


452
00:33:15.577 --> 00:33:17.579
Or I'll start shooting!

453
00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:26.088
It's okay! It's just a candy bar!
COCOA BLASTER


454
00:33:33.554 --> 00:33:36.265
4 minutes, 16 seconds.
- Damn, they're fast!


455
00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:50.696
Wow! Who's that?

456
00:33:51.572 --> 00:33:53.490
Dr. Elisabeth Zollner.

457
00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:56.118
I'd spar with her any day.

458
00:33:56.618 --> 00:34:00.164
She heads a bank robbery task force.
She catches the big fish.


459
00:34:00.956 --> 00:34:03.709
How do you know?
- She gives a course at the bank


460
00:34:03.876 --> 00:34:07.004
about professional conduct
during bank robberies.


461
00:34:07.129 --> 00:34:12.301
She has perfect breasts.
- I bet she makes you shake your Wiener.


462
00:34:15.304 --> 00:34:19.099
Say that one more time
and I'll staple your ears to your balls.


463
00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:22.102
Wow! What happened to you?

464
00:34:22.311 --> 00:34:25.314
I like it! Respect!

465
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.612
It was a false alarm.
Just a bum with a candy bar.


466
00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:35.324
Close the bank.
I need statements from all witnesses.


467
00:34:35.824 --> 00:34:39.078
Seriously? It was a candy bar!
There must be 30 witnesses!


468
00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:43.791
She didn't ask for your opinion.
- No one goes till they make a statement.


469
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:49.838
Then your people stormed in,

470
00:34:50.631 --> 00:34:53.008
and that's all I saw.

471
00:34:53.759 --> 00:34:56.720
You look familiar.
- Really?


472
00:34:57.346 --> 00:34:59.932
Is it possible I've seen you before?

473
00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:02.851
No, I don't think so.

474
00:35:03.769 --> 00:35:05.813
I doubt it, anyway.

475
00:35:06.146 --> 00:35:09.233
I guess I just
have one of those faces.

476
00:35:10.192 --> 00:35:12.402
Did you deposit the money?
- Pardon?


477
00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:15.072
You were leaving.
Did you deposit the money?


478
00:35:15.906 --> 00:35:17.533
Yes.

479
00:35:18.575 --> 00:35:19.660
Thanks.

480
00:35:20.953 --> 00:35:22.579
Next.

481
00:35:23.831 --> 00:35:27.376
10, 15, 20...

482
00:35:33.048 --> 00:35:37.511
35, 40, 45.
Hey, we said 50!


483
00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:40.681
45, 50...
What difference does it make?


484
00:35:40.848 --> 00:35:43.308
I could ask the cops
what difference it makes.


485
00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:46.019
Five more. Come on.
- Listen up, crab louse.


486
00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:49.231
Take the cash and scram,
or I'll give you five fingers!


487
00:35:49.398 --> 00:35:52.901
I'll beat the shit out of you!
- Do you have to beat people up?


488
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.655
I'm utilizing my talents.
- Then why didn't you screw him?


489
00:35:56.822 --> 00:35:59.783
You think you're hot shit
because you studied?


490
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.995
What's your highest degree?
A driver's license?


491
00:36:03.162 --> 00:36:05.873
I've got a masters from Heidelberg, so...

492
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:09.501
Pull yourselves together.
Just a few more days,


493
00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:13.005
and then we go our separate ways.
Now shake hands.


494
00:36:13.172 --> 00:36:15.507
Shake hands. Both of you.

495
00:36:18.177 --> 00:36:20.345
Just rise above it.

496
00:36:21.847 --> 00:36:26.226
Luckily it was just a false alarm.
- You can never be too sure.


497
00:36:26.518 --> 00:36:29.605
I'd like to see an overview
of all teller transactions.


498
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:31.773
Is that really necessary?

499
00:36:31.982 --> 00:36:35.152
Our client's privacy...
- I don't want to know amounts.


500
00:36:35.319 --> 00:36:39.406
I want a list of who was here,
and what transactions took place, okay?


501
00:36:47.414 --> 00:36:51.418
Tell me, Dr. Zollner...
Do you mind if I call you Lizzy?


502
00:36:52.794 --> 00:36:55.505
I don't know when you're off duty, but...

503
00:36:55.631 --> 00:36:58.634
I know a cute Italian place.
- Really?


504
00:36:59.801 --> 00:37:03.222
What a coincidence.
I know a cute Italian too.


505
00:37:07.017 --> 00:37:08.769
Massimo?

506
00:37:10.938 --> 00:37:13.899
Would you accompany Mr Schumacher
to his office?


507
00:37:29.122 --> 00:37:31.583
Hey, buddy. Want a Rolex?
- Keep moving.


508
00:37:33.627 --> 00:37:35.087
Chris?

509
00:37:35.295 --> 00:37:38.173
Chris "Iron Fist" Hoffmann!
Is it really you?


510
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.803
Twiggy! Rolfi!
I haven't seen you guys in forever!


511
00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.807
Not long enough for me
to forget your ugly mug!


512
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.435
What an ugly mug!
- Yeah, I heard you were in prison.


513
00:37:50.894 --> 00:37:53.814
Three years in Moabit.

514
00:37:54.273 --> 00:37:57.901
But they were the best years of my life.
- Mine too. It was great.


515
00:38:00.362 --> 00:38:02.322
We miss you.
The old gang and all.


516
00:38:04.157 --> 00:38:05.909
What's new with you?
- Yeah.


517
00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:07.744
Oh!

518
00:38:08.287 --> 00:38:12.749
I've got a new life, new future,
new woman! I'm opening my own gym.


519
00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:15.127
Wow!
- No shit!


520
00:38:15.294 --> 00:38:18.297
Chris is a real businessman, like us!
- Right!


521
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.090
Awesome!

522
00:38:31.393 --> 00:38:34.062
Why are we doing this here?
- Long term parking.


523
00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:38.150
By the time they realize their car's
been stolen, we'll be long gone.


524
00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:42.821
What happens if we find an unlocked car?
- Then Tobias will hot-wire it.


525
00:38:44.323 --> 00:38:47.534
You know how to hot-wire a car?
- You bet your ass, I can.


526
00:38:48.827 --> 00:38:51.872
I love the new Tobias. High five!

527
00:38:52.164 --> 00:38:54.207
What's that?
- This?


528
00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:57.586
I tattooed it myself.
It's Japanese for...


529
00:38:58.462 --> 00:39:00.589
"Universe."
- "Universe?"


530
00:39:00.922 --> 00:39:03.175
How stupid is that?
- Stupid?


531
00:39:04.009 --> 00:39:06.887
It's retarded to tattoo yourself.
- Retarded?


532
00:39:07.054 --> 00:39:10.265
Are you deaf, Grandpa? It hurts, it's...
- That's it.


533
00:39:10.432 --> 00:39:13.477
You've insulted me.
I'm gonna rearrange your face.


534
00:39:13.643 --> 00:39:16.605
Give it a try, Grandpa.
You'd better order a new hip.


535
00:39:16.772 --> 00:39:18.774
Stay still! Stay still!

536
00:39:20.275 --> 00:39:22.778
My crane is legendary.
- Hey, I found one!


537
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:30.702
Sorry! I thought we were fighting!
- I've got Band-Aids.


538
00:39:31.078 --> 00:39:33.789
Can you guys focus for one second.
Come on!


539
00:39:38.752 --> 00:39:41.797
When you said you knew
how to hot-wire a car...


540
00:39:42.047 --> 00:39:45.092
He can do it.
You've done it before, right?


541
00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:50.097
Technically, I've only seen it done.

542
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.433
What'? Don't tell me you saw it on
Bullet & Podolski!


543
00:39:53.809 --> 00:39:56.144
Oh, man! I take it all back!

544
00:39:56.395 --> 00:40:01.024
The new Tobias has a screw loose!
- Hey, my screws are all... tight.


545
00:40:01.191 --> 00:40:04.194
Season 6, episode 3.
- The one with the blonde secretary?


546
00:40:04.403 --> 00:40:08.782
No, the one with the transvestite's
donor kidney in the trash compactor.


547
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:12.119
Donor kidney?
- I don't believe it! -Me neither!


548
00:40:12.327 --> 00:40:14.663
Hey, I did a hell of a job
at the bank!


549
00:40:15.163 --> 00:40:18.208
Nobody believed in me!
If I say I can do it, I can do it!


550
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.754
I did it! I did it!
- He did it!


551
00:40:22.921 --> 00:40:24.923
You did it!

552
00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:28.218
I told you he could do it!
- I did it!


553
00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:31.680
CHECKOUT

554
00:40:36.643 --> 00:40:39.688
That'll be 87,50, please.
- Sure.


555
00:40:39.855 --> 00:40:41.857
Do we have any money?

556
00:40:42.732 --> 00:40:45.402
I'll pay with my card.
- No cards.


557
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:49.448
They can trace it back to you.
You can't use a card.


558
00:40:51.116 --> 00:40:52.451
One moment.

559
00:40:54.578 --> 00:40:57.956
What are we going to do?
- Just smash through the barrier.


560
00:40:58.123 --> 00:41:01.501
She already saw my face.
Please don't say you have to kill her.


561
00:41:02.002 --> 00:41:04.421
Can he read minds?
- Any ideas, leader?


562
00:41:07.132 --> 00:41:09.301
Can you seduce her?
- What?


563
00:41:09.468 --> 00:41:12.929
No, that's not my strong suit.
I usually just crash and burn.


564
00:41:13.263 --> 00:41:16.933
Even better. Crash and burn
as hard as you possibly can.


565
00:41:17.517 --> 00:41:19.936
Feed her your best line!
- I don't have any.


566
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:22.856
You don't have any?
- He doesn't have any!


567
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.692
Whatever, just do something! Go!

568
00:41:28.445 --> 00:41:30.489
Excuse me,

569
00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:34.534
would you have coffee with me?
I mean, would you have sex with me?


570
00:41:34.993 --> 00:41:37.204
No, have coffee, but no sex?

571
00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:41.082
Unless you'd like to have sex.
I have condoms. One condom.


572
00:41:41.708 --> 00:41:44.169
Do I need more than one?
- Keep going!


573
00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:49.549
I won't leave here without a date.
You can choose: coffee with sex,


574
00:41:49.883 --> 00:41:53.220
or without sex, or maybe with sex...

575
00:41:53.386 --> 00:41:55.555
Never park here again.

576
00:41:56.306 --> 00:41:58.308
Okay.

577
00:42:04.147 --> 00:42:06.274
We've got a getaway car! Hey!

578
00:42:08.026 --> 00:42:10.237
She didn't like me.
- Sure she did!


579
00:42:10.403 --> 00:42:13.865
Didn't you see how she looked at you?
- She wanted to marry you!


580
00:42:16.785 --> 00:42:20.121
Okay, here's the plan.
At exactly 11:00,


581
00:42:20.622 --> 00:42:23.250
when code man Ralf
goes to the bathroom


582
00:42:23.959 --> 00:42:26.503
to have a nice dump,

583
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:29.923
Chris makes a scene
in the lobby.


584
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:33.176
I distract Laurel and Hardy
from security:


585
00:42:33.343 --> 00:42:36.805
"Hey, you guys!"
And they take me outside,


586
00:42:37.472 --> 00:42:41.518
in front of the bank.
- I make my way over here and wait.


587
00:42:41.685 --> 00:42:45.355
While I make my way to the bathroom,
to get the code


588
00:42:45.814 --> 00:42:48.191
from our little pooper,
while Max...


589
00:42:48.567 --> 00:42:51.444
While I wait for Peter's signal.
Do the signal.


590
00:42:54.447 --> 00:42:56.783
Hey, we're in a bank,
not a forest!


591
00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.245
Whatever! I'll think of something else.
- Okay.


592
00:43:00.412 --> 00:43:03.915
So, I wait for Max's signal.
Do a signal.


593
00:43:04.291 --> 00:43:07.419
Let's go, buffalo!
- Now that's a signal!


594
00:43:08.003 --> 00:43:11.423
I'll cuff Laurel and Hardy
to the glass doors,


595
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.552
and jump in the getaway car.
- Then it goes really fast.


596
00:43:17.971 --> 00:43:20.098
I grab all the cash,

597
00:43:20.432 --> 00:43:23.018
and we leave
through this side exit.


598
00:43:23.351 --> 00:43:26.646
Where I'll be waiting to escape with you
into the urban jungle.


599
00:43:28.607 --> 00:43:32.152
And even if any of these bank idiots
hits the alarm,


600
00:43:32.444 --> 00:43:35.155
we'll be in and out
in less than 4 minutes.


601
00:43:35.989 --> 00:43:38.325
It's brilliant. 
It's brilliant!

602
00:43:39.034 --> 00:43:41.536
Is that good, or is that good?
- It's double good!


603
00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:47.208
What about me?
- What about you?


604
00:43:48.043 --> 00:43:50.337
Well, where am I?

605
00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.381
I don't even have a doll.

606
00:43:53.715 --> 00:43:57.218
You don't want me there.
You jerks don't want me there!


607
00:43:58.637 --> 00:44:01.181
I'm the insider, damn it!

608
00:44:01.598 --> 00:44:05.060
I organized the car and the keys, and...
- Calm down.


609
00:44:05.226 --> 00:44:08.063
It's not like that.
- Then where's my doll?


610
00:44:09.064 --> 00:44:13.485
After we do the robbery,
that task force chick...


611
00:44:13.902 --> 00:44:17.614
Zollner.
- Then Zollner will show up.


612
00:44:17.989 --> 00:44:20.992
She'll go through her list
of everyone with a motive.


613
00:44:21.368 --> 00:44:24.913
And who has a better motive than you?

614
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.334
Am I supposed to just wait at home?
- You need an airtight alibi.


615
00:44:29.751 --> 00:44:33.046
Throw a little party that day.
- Sure, a party.


616
00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.549
I'm not exactly a party animal,
if you haven't noticed.


617
00:44:36.883 --> 00:44:38.885
Don't sell yourself short!

618
00:44:39.344 --> 00:44:44.391
We need a place where
lots of people see you,


619
00:44:44.808 --> 00:44:48.395
and testify they were with you
at the time of the robbery.


620
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:54.984
Or that you were with them.
POPE VISIT


621
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.155
Can someone please tell me
what's going on here?


622
00:45:18.591 --> 00:45:19.718
JESUS GIVE ME STRENGTH

623
00:45:31.438 --> 00:45:33.481
SECURITY AND MONEY TRANSPORT

624
00:45:48.037 --> 00:45:50.206
Peace be with you, brother.

625
00:45:50.665 --> 00:45:52.792
I've seen him six times already.

626
00:45:53.001 --> 00:45:55.712
His voice speaks through me.

627
00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:58.131
Here, feel.

628
00:45:58.965 --> 00:46:01.760
Can you feel his energy
flowing through me?


629
00:46:02.677 --> 00:46:04.763
Morning, Ralf.

630
00:46:04.929 --> 00:46:06.931
Is it 11:00 already?

631
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:13.688
Death to banks!
We're coming for our money!


632
00:46:14.189 --> 00:46:16.858
They take our hard-earned money,

633
00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:20.111
and wipe their white,
capitalist asses with it!


634
00:46:20.278 --> 00:46:25.074
And their shit sticks to our money!
Can't you smell it?


635
00:46:25.241 --> 00:46:29.454
Hey, fatty! Go away!
I'm giving a lecture!


636
00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:33.833
It's a free country!
Buy yourself a ticket by the entrance!


637
00:46:36.795 --> 00:46:38.963
Laurel and Hardy!

638
00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:43.802
Don't worry.
The Holy Father is never late.


639
00:46:44.427 --> 00:46:46.471
He is ultimate perfection.

640
00:46:46.638 --> 00:46:50.225
The light of the sun in the firmament,
as deep as the ocean...


641
00:47:33.142 --> 00:47:35.854
Ralf Niester,
this is an armed robbery!


642
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.440
Give me the code for the safe room. Now!
- Dieter, is that you?


643
00:47:39.649 --> 00:47:41.776
Let me take a shit in peace!

644
00:47:50.451 --> 00:47:52.829
Yippie ki yay, motherfucker.

645
00:47:55.248 --> 00:47:57.166
The code.

646
00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.510
I can do it!
I can do it!


647
00:48:07.677 --> 00:48:09.846
They're counting on me.

648
00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:02.273
Hey, fatty!

649
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:05.026
Come and get me!

650
00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:15.870
Looking for this?

651
00:49:28.132 --> 00:49:30.468
Good night!

652
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.477
Nobody move!
- Everybody on the floor!


653
00:49:39.769 --> 00:49:41.688
Hands up!
- Both hands!


654
00:49:42.021 --> 00:49:44.607
Freeze!
- Lie down!


655
00:49:45.817 --> 00:49:48.027
We should've practiced.
- I should go first.


656
00:49:48.361 --> 00:49:52.240
I have a trained voice. I can project.
- I can do it just as well!


657
00:49:52.573 --> 00:49:55.660
Let's save the willie contest for later,
got it?


658
00:49:55.994 --> 00:49:58.287
On the ground, people!

659
00:50:00.832 --> 00:50:02.709
This is a robbery!

660
00:50:14.887 --> 00:50:16.764
Where are the damn wires?

661
00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:23.771
Who are you?

662
00:50:31.946 --> 00:50:33.948
That's better.

663
00:50:39.037 --> 00:50:40.329
Motherfucker!

664
00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:45.668
If I hear even one peep,

665
00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.714
I might just...
I said shut up!


666
00:50:53.092 --> 00:50:56.596
There was a sound.
I heard it loud and clear...


667
00:50:58.723 --> 00:51:00.016
Huh?

668
00:51:05.146 --> 00:51:07.190
Everything's fine.

669
00:51:11.986 --> 00:51:15.114
Who's got the gun?
Who's got the gun?


670
00:51:15.448 --> 00:51:16.699
I do!

671
00:51:19.952 --> 00:51:22.246
4-5-3-7-7... what?

672
00:51:23.956 --> 00:51:26.209
What'?
- Seven.


673
00:51:26.876 --> 00:51:30.004
Seven?
Three sevens? Are you sure?


674
00:51:38.221 --> 00:51:41.849
If I see one
of you idiots even blink,

675
00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:46.020
then I'll introduce you to my gun,
is that clear?


676
00:51:50.316 --> 00:51:53.236
This is a real gun!
It can do a lot of damage!


677
00:51:57.782 --> 00:51:59.534
Shit! Fuck!

678
00:52:01.494 --> 00:52:03.204
Fuck!

679
00:52:03.663 --> 00:52:07.500
Did you know these are real bullets?
- Let's discuss that later.


680
00:52:07.834 --> 00:52:11.295
You lied to me!
- The blanks were sold out! Forget it!


681
00:52:11.629 --> 00:52:14.590
No, that's exactly why
I wanted to be the leader!


682
00:52:16.008 --> 00:52:18.052
Houston, we have a problem.
- What?


683
00:52:18.386 --> 00:52:20.805
If you're in here,
who's out there?


684
00:52:21.973 --> 00:52:23.724
Oh, fuck!

685
00:52:42.535 --> 00:52:43.786
My fault.
- Come on!


686
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.498
I would've had it.
- We've got 20 seconds! Go!


687
00:52:52.295 --> 00:52:53.295
Ten!

688
00:53:02.513 --> 00:53:04.140
Five!

689
00:53:15.693 --> 00:53:18.613
Where the hell is he?
- No idea.


690
00:53:24.243 --> 00:53:26.287
Please, please, please!

691
00:53:31.209 --> 00:53:32.960
This can't be happening!

692
00:53:38.049 --> 00:53:39.050
Go!

693
00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:42.929
Oh, God!
- I don't believe it!


694
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.766
Shit, it stalled!
- No!


695
00:53:46.933 --> 00:53:49.393
Chris, start it and drive!

696
00:53:51.062 --> 00:53:53.439
Get out and push! Go!

697
00:54:02.698 --> 00:54:04.242
Push!

698
00:54:25.179 --> 00:54:27.098
We are...

699
00:54:27.598 --> 00:54:31.477
rich!
We're filthy rich!


700
00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:36.065
Watch out, idiot!

701
00:54:54.542 --> 00:54:58.504
If I ever see your ugly ass again...
- Definitely. I understand.


702
00:54:58.671 --> 00:55:01.424
It was a stupid idea.
It won't happen again.


703
00:55:14.395 --> 00:55:16.772
It looks like it was very well-prepared.

704
00:55:17.398 --> 00:55:20.609
The two bank robbers knew
the bank had a lot of cash today.


705
00:55:20.776 --> 00:55:22.945
Three.
- Pardon?


706
00:55:23.279 --> 00:55:26.157
There were three perpetrators.
Write it down:


707
00:55:26.324 --> 00:55:28.534
Perpetrators: three.

708
00:55:29.493 --> 00:55:32.872
The two men with guns,
and a third: the distraction.


709
00:55:33.372 --> 00:55:36.876
Probably also the driver.
- We'll do a composite sketch.


710
00:55:37.043 --> 00:55:39.545
A waste of time.
They wore disguises.


711
00:55:40.254 --> 00:55:43.799
How do you know?
- If they knew about the money,


712
00:55:43.966 --> 00:55:46.677
they also knew
about the hundreds of cameras.


713
00:55:46.844 --> 00:55:49.055
How much did they take?

714
00:55:50.973 --> 00:55:53.184
About 2.1 million.

715
00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:57.355
We'll get them.

716
00:56:15.623 --> 00:56:17.666
Shall we say a few words'?

717
00:56:19.794 --> 00:56:23.964
It was a good car. It wasn't the fastest,
or most reliable, but...


718
00:56:26.217 --> 00:56:28.219
It burns!

719
00:56:32.765 --> 00:56:35.184
Okay, boys.
Who's got the bags?


720
00:56:36.185 --> 00:56:38.187
I thought you had them.

721
00:57:08.092 --> 00:57:10.594
Okay, how much is it?

722
00:57:11.095 --> 00:57:13.097
At least two million.

723
00:57:13.347 --> 00:57:16.100
I wish I could've seen Schumacher's face!

724
00:57:16.267 --> 00:57:18.477
Gentlemen, to us.

725
00:57:18.644 --> 00:57:20.729
I've got to smell it first.

726
00:57:24.692 --> 00:57:26.735
That smells like...

727
00:57:26.902 --> 00:57:29.655
payback!
- Yeah!


728
00:58:00.519 --> 00:58:03.355
This is better than jacking off!

729
00:58:06.484 --> 00:58:08.611
You have a Hitler stash!
- What?


730
00:58:09.028 --> 00:58:11.697
You look like the fuhrer, man!

731
00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:18.621
What's wrong? Come on!

732
00:58:18.871 --> 00:58:21.123
Come on, dance! Dance!

733
00:58:24.752 --> 00:58:27.755
I think we have a tiny little problem.

734
00:58:29.798 --> 00:58:31.800
You've got something on...

735
00:58:32.384 --> 00:58:34.720
And on your...

736
00:58:46.315 --> 00:58:48.651
Can you all see?

737
00:58:51.654 --> 00:58:55.574
It may have been a surprise to you,
but I was expecting a bank robbery.


738
00:58:55.741 --> 00:59:00.579
The homeless man who stormed the bank
last week was a piece of the puzzle.


739
00:59:00.746 --> 00:59:03.582
That's why I had the bills
in the safe marked.


740
00:59:04.625 --> 00:59:08.212
Hopefully the robbers will put the bills
into circulation today.


741
00:59:08.379 --> 00:59:11.882
So we need to notify all banks,
gas stations and businesses.


742
00:59:12.091 --> 00:59:15.511
If a toilet attendant collects
a marked bill in the boondocks,


743
00:59:15.678 --> 00:59:17.888
I want to know about it.

744
00:59:18.264 --> 00:59:20.891
I was afraid
we were dealing with pros,


745
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:26.146
but pros don't argue
and almost lose a gun to a civilian.


746
00:59:26.855 --> 00:59:30.192
They're amateurs.
And right now they're nervous,


747
00:59:30.568 --> 00:59:32.903
insecure and desperate.

748
00:59:33.112 --> 00:59:35.364
And they're going mess up.

749
00:59:36.448 --> 00:59:38.492
There must be something.

750
00:59:39.159 --> 00:59:41.745
They always make a mistake.

751
00:59:45.624 --> 00:59:47.209
Stop.

752
00:59:47.835 --> 00:59:49.753
Zoom in on the wrist.

753
00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:56.719
What the hell is that?
- That's the mistake.


754
00:59:58.345 --> 01:00:01.223
You get the cash but it's useless.

755
01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:05.561
I could've had my gym,
and women for the rest of my life.


756
01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:09.523
I really feel like punching somebody.
- Oh, yeah!


757
01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:15.821
It's not my fault.
- You must've known!


758
01:00:16.155 --> 01:00:18.073
The bills are never marked.

759
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.578
I didn't know they'd pull out
the spray can the day we rob the bank!


760
01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:26.540
You don't have to broadcast it.

761
01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:30.377
We'll wait it out till the dust clears.
- The dust isn't going to clear!


762
01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:37.009
Yes?
Yes, I remember you, Dr. Zollner.


763
01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.970
How are you?

764
01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:44.558
Yes, I saw that on television.

765
01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.730
No problem.

766
01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:56.028
She wants me to answer a few questions.
- We're all screwed!


767
01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:59.323
Calm down. Hey, it's fine.

768
01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:03.327
We knew this would happen.
Tobias has 50,000 eye witnesses,


769
01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:05.996
including the pope.
- Right, the pope!


770
01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:08.248
We have nothing to worry about.

771
01:01:12.795 --> 01:01:15.339
Could you hold one second?

772
01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:18.008
Fuck! It's Zollner!

773
01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:20.219
Why is she calling you?

774
01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:25.099
Yes, sorry about that. Yes?

775
01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:28.727
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

776
01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:33.607
Sure, no problem.

777
01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.318
I'm happy to help-

778
01:01:38.821 --> 01:01:41.699
You still think everything's okay?

779
01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.826
No way!

780
01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:48.580
She must have the wrong number.

781
01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:52.668
Yes?

782
01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.921
Yes, I saw it on the radio.

783
01:01:57.005 --> 01:01:58.048
Okay.

784
01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.679
Okay, then have a nice day.

785
01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:34.209
Sorry, guys.
I'm sure everything will be fine.


786
01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:41.800
So, why do you streak naked?

787
01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:45.179
Like I said,
because I'm depressed.


788
01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:49.975
So you streak naked in front of
thousands of people and the pope?


789
01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:54.813
I got caught up in the moment.
I had to feel the holy wind...


790
01:02:55.481 --> 01:02:57.691
on my naked, vulnerable body,

791
01:02:58.025 --> 01:03:00.778
whipping me, giving me solace.

792
01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:04.448
Do you know what I can't stand?

793
01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:07.618
When men like you
take women like me for a fool.


794
01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:11.914
I don't take you for a fool.
All I'm trying to say is


795
01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:17.002
I'm not the only man with this tattoo.
- According to your file,


796
01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:20.547
you're a violent man
who takes what he needs.


797
01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:26.136
Our video shows a man with your tattoo
stealing 2.1 million euros.


798
01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:30.974
Doesn't that seem strange?
You told me you made a deposit.


799
01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.185
Yes.
- You lied.


800
01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.896
I was pretty rattled.

801
01:03:36.355 --> 01:03:38.941
That bum came storming in...
- Rattled?


802
01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:41.819
I needed validation.

803
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:44.112
Validation from the very top.

804
01:03:44.446 --> 01:03:48.116
And who's higher than the pope?

805
01:03:48.909 --> 01:03:52.246
You seem nervous.
- May I have a glass of water?


806
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.998
No.
- Okay.


807
01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:57.417
Help me out.
- Okay.


808
01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:01.338
If the bank fired me and I wanted
to rob it to get my revenge,


809
01:04:01.797 --> 01:04:05.676
I'd find people to do the dirty work
and make sure I had an air tight alibi.


810
01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:08.804
What are you trying to say?
- Well...


811
01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:13.517
A bum storms into a bank.
You're there, but don't make a deposit.


812
01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:18.897
Instead, you have the chance to see
how long it takes the police to arrive.


813
01:04:19.273 --> 01:04:23.735
If you had any hard evidence against me,
I'd be in handcuffs.


814
01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:27.281
You're right.
We don't have hard evidence.


815
01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:29.533
You're free to go.

816
01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.786
Really? Thanks.

817
01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:35.873
One more thing.

818
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.960
Do you know this man?

819
01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:41.545
No.

820
01:04:41.879 --> 01:04:43.922
When I said "no,"
I meant "yes."


821
01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:47.634
Then why did you say "no"?

822
01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:53.223
So you do know him?
- Yes, but I haven't seen him in ages.


823
01:04:53.849 --> 01:04:56.143
Anything else?
- No, that's all.


824
01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:59.229
You've been a great help.
- Glad to hear it.


825
01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:04.443
Bullet & Podolski.

826
01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:08.113
In the bank you said you just
had one of those faces.


827
01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:11.450
You lied about that as well.

828
01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:13.952
Right?

829
01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:33.430
Were you followed?
- No.


830
01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:37.809
Why would anyone follow me?
- You're our accomplice, you windbag.


831
01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.438
I'm taking you down with me.
- That's enough!


832
01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:44.524
They'll only catch us
if we use the cash.

833
01:05:44.733 --> 01:05:47.986
Should we just flush 2.1 million euros
down the toilet?


834
01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.699
The bills are marked so they're useless.
When do they stop looking for the cash?


835
01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:55.911
They stop looking
when they catch the robbers.


836
01:05:56.954 --> 01:06:00.248
When Zollner has the robbers,
they'll stop looking for the money'?


837
01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:05.295
All we have to do is
frame someone else for the robbery.


838
01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:09.633
Bullet & Podolski. Season 2, episode 6.
- No!


839
01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:13.136
Jog my memory.
- The stolen Ferrari.


840
01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:16.640
They tried to frame the Mexican for it.
- Yeah!


841
01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:21.144
That's it! The Mexican!
That was a damn good episode.


842
01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:26.608
We just have get Zollner
to think someone else did it.


843
01:06:26.942 --> 01:06:29.111
Heinrich Schumacher.
- Who?


844
01:06:29.528 --> 01:06:33.740
Schumacher is a disgusting,
heartless, greedy bastard,


845
01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:37.703
who's got access to the whole bank.
Schumacher is our Mexican!


846
01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:41.248
But how do we convince Zollner?

847
01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:42.791
I've got it.

848
01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:46.128
She's single.
- No!


849
01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:50.716
While Zollner was interrogating me
she got a text message


850
01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.510
from Eternity.
She's single and hunting.


851
01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:57.597
And we'll provide her with prey.

852
01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:04.813
Someone she doesn't
suspect of bank robbery.


853
01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:09.776
Me?

854
01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.863
No! No!

855
01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:16.033
We're a team, Max.

856
01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.994
I'm not going to prison, got it!
Count me out!


857
01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:21.913
What about the cash?
- It's not worth it!


858
01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.208
Some of us can't just
run back to daddy's checkbook!


859
01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:28.837
It's not like that.
- You want your ass powdered with caviar!


860
01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:31.339
I earned every penny! Every penny!

861
01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.967
You gonna cry?
- Don't make me kick you.


862
01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:38.180
You kicked me as I looked away.
- I'll make sure you look this time.


863
01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:40.724
Okay, I'll look.
- Okay. Come on!


864
01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:45.854
There's something on your nose.
- Where?


865
01:07:50.067 --> 01:07:52.402
Want me to break your little arm?
- Oh God!


866
01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:55.322
Okay, it's fine!
- What? You give up?


867
01:07:56.198 --> 01:07:58.033
Should we intervene?

868
01:07:58.492 --> 01:08:00.368
I give up! Oh God!

869
01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:03.205
You're in this team
till the day you die!

870
01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:05.540
Till I die, and beyond, okay?

871
01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.918
That wasn't so hard.

872
01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:12.631
Freddie?

873
01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:17.761
You're not writing.
- No, I'm cooking your favorite meal.


874
01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:22.432
Come, have a taste.
- That's great, thanks!


875
01:08:22.933 --> 01:08:24.309
Yummy! Yummy!

876
01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:29.106
I can explain.

877
01:08:29.231 --> 01:08:32.484
A poker club?
Do you take me for a fool?


878
01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:36.488
How could you?
You're in deep shit!


879
01:08:36.822 --> 01:08:40.742
Our girls could grow up without a dad!
- I wasn't totally honest with you.


880
01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:44.246
I gambled with our savings a bit,
but the bank messed up!


881
01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:47.791
It's the bank's fault now?
- Yes, actually.


882
01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:52.170
That's just... unbelievable!

883
01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:55.090
How dare you!
- Please stop.


884
01:08:55.549 --> 01:08:58.593
I know I messed up,
but we just found a way


885
01:08:58.927 --> 01:09:03.682
to get off the hook, keep the cash,
and blame it on a real bastard.


886
01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:06.434
How much money is in the bag?

887
01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:11.231
Two million.

888
01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:22.409
I know what you're going to say.
- I'm so mad at you,


889
01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:26.997
and we'll discuss just how mad I am
with a marriage counselor soon,


890
01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:31.668
but just tell me one thing:

891
01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:33.920
How can I help?

892
01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:39.843
How can I help
so we can keep the money'?


893
01:09:42.637 --> 01:09:47.058
You think we can trust her?
- Of course you can, you twits.


894
01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:51.354
If you're in trouble, so is my husband,
and neither of us want that.


895
01:09:51.521 --> 01:09:54.191
We have to change the hair.
- Give me a minute.


896
01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:58.403
So, take a look.
- I volunteer at a soup kitchen?


897
01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:01.948
I've never done volunteer work.
- Zollner's a woman and so am I.


898
01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:05.368
I know exactly what she wants
to see on a dating profile.


899
01:10:06.161 --> 01:10:08.455
The other one.

900
01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:13.293
We can't use your last name,
or she'll know you lost your money.


901
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.796
Parted in the center?
- Parted in the center? Maybe, yes.


902
01:10:17.005 --> 01:10:19.883
So, your profile name is:

903
01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:22.135
Mad Max.
- What?


904
01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:26.848
And then maybe a dog.
- A dog?


905
01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:29.684
A photo with a cute dog.
- No. I'm allergic.


906
01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:31.770
A cat?
- Come on.


907
01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:34.272
Yes, we need a cat.
- I'm on it.


908
01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:58.630
OVERWORKED, UNDERRATED.
MAKING MY DREAMS COME TRUE.


909
01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:11.685
Thursday night at 8:00?
- 7:45.


910
01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:15.313
And you're sure Schumacher...
- Every Thursday at 7:45.


911
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.816
He'll take Heidi.
- And his wife?


912
01:11:18.233 --> 01:11:20.986
She's at a charity event.

913
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:24.906
She's coming! She said yes!

914
01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:30.870
We've got one chance. Let's do it right.
- You think Heidi would like this?


915
01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:35.959
I gave that to you for our anniversary.
- Relax, I know they're not real,


916
01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:40.422
but Heidi won't know.
- They aren't? They were expensive!


917
01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.643
FROM A SECRET ADMIRER

918
01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.187
That's it?
- That's it.


919
01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:58.857
You can handle that, right?
- Yeah.


920
01:11:59.024 --> 01:12:03.695
And one of you needs
to get this on your wrist.


921
01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:08.199
What does it mean?
- It's Japanese for "universe."


922
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:15.081
What if we have to describe the guy?
- Yeah, then what?


923
01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.585
Wow!

924
01:12:19.294 --> 01:12:21.963
That's the best meal
we've had in a while.


925
01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:26.801
We should do this more often.
Get a babysitter, go out...


926
01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:30.472
Yeah, or rob a bank
and frame a stranger.


927
01:12:31.765 --> 01:12:35.602
I'm really sorry.
I should've told you the truth earlier.


928
01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:39.898
I was just too proud,
or too stupid.


929
01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:44.319
Maybe this whole mess is a sign.
- Yeah?


930
01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:47.155
A sign that it's time
you finally get a new job.


931
01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:51.117
A reliable job.
- Wait a minute. I'm an actor!


932
01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:54.579
Dustin Hoffman taught me.
Not directly, but...


933
01:12:54.913 --> 01:12:58.083
It's show time.
- What?


934
01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:04.672
Welcome. May I take your coat?

935
01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:07.926
But of course.
- Enjoy your meal.


936
01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.762
Thanks.
- We will.


937
01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:17.936
Pardon me.
- Watch it! Wait a minute.


938
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:21.314
Is this yours?
- I'm sorry.


939
01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:24.317
Gloves?
- Pardon my husband.


940
01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:27.278
He's such a klutz.
- I see.


941
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:31.157
The prices here
can give you the jitters.


942
01:13:49.676 --> 01:13:52.429
How did it go?
- It was a piece of cake.


943
01:13:53.138 --> 01:13:54.931
Here.
Careful.


944
01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.491
Elisabeth?
Hi, I'm...


945
01:14:14.576 --> 01:14:18.329
Mad Max.
- Yes, Max.


946
01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:24.043
This is my first internet date, so...

947
01:14:25.712 --> 01:14:28.631
You look enchanting.
- Thanks.


948
01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:30.925
You're welcome.

949
01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:33.511
Oh, yeah.

950
01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:36.931
There you go.

951
01:14:45.023 --> 01:14:48.193
Is everything okay?
- Yes, everything's fine.


952
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.862
I know that man.

953
01:14:58.912 --> 01:15:01.998
A glass of champagne?
- A bottle.


954
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.981
If anything happens,
I'll call your cells.


955
01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:28.274
Okay.

956
01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:36.699
What's with the necklace?

957
01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:40.036
I'd like to thank my secret admirer.
- Admirer?


958
01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:46.167
I'll be sure to let him know.
- Are you role playing?


959
01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:50.964
That's hot.
You're not my secret admirer.


960
01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:56.302
You're my gardener.
And I'm a stripper.


961
01:15:56.970 --> 01:16:00.265
Who desperately needs someone
to water her bush.


962
01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:08.606
His wife is much younger.

963
01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:12.610
She's not his wife.
She's one of his employees.


964
01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:21.119
I know him from the news!
Didn't his bank get...


965
01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:27.208
Not so loud.
- Sorry. Why not?


966
01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:30.712
I'm investigating the case.

967
01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:35.508
Um... Are you a police officer?

968
01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:37.135
Yes.

969
01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:44.642
I head a bank robbery task force.

970
01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:49.647
Okay, that's heavy.
- It's okay if you run. Most men do.


971
01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:52.817
Why would I?
- Who knows.


972
01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:55.820
My profession seems to irritate men.

973
01:16:56.279 --> 01:17:01.284
Well, I think it's,
as my mom would say: sexy.


974
01:17:01.409 --> 01:17:03.953
With a soft "S"?
- Zexy.


975
01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.623
Z- Zexy?
- Yeah.


976
01:17:24.766 --> 01:17:26.893
Where'd you learn that?

977
01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.021
I had an eventful adolescence.
- Fine with me,


978
01:17:30.355 --> 01:17:32.732
as long as the alarm doesn't go off.

979
01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:41.824
Rocky Balboa!
- Good work!


980
01:17:42.909 --> 01:17:45.995
Touch my ass again and you're toast.
- Got it.


981
01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:51.334
I always played detective as a kid.

982
01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:52.710
See?

983
01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:59.384
Thanks, but I'll have to stop
because you can't understand me.


984
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.844
Yeah.
- Okay, I'll concentrate.


985
01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:04.347
I'll take a guess.

986
01:18:06.391 --> 01:18:09.727
Oh yes, the man appears
to have blood on his fingers.


987
01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:14.315
Or is that just his lover's lipstick?

988
01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:17.902
No, he's definitely guilty.
- Really?


989
01:18:18.236 --> 01:18:20.113
Nice try.

990
01:18:20.655 --> 01:18:24.701
Yeah, but bank director, bank robber.
Aren't they the same in the end?


991
01:18:24.826 --> 01:18:26.953
They are tonight, yes.

992
01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:30.748
But seriously, did you ever consider it?
- What?


993
01:18:30.915 --> 01:18:34.711
In every good murder mystery,
the most unlikely suspect


994
01:18:35.086 --> 01:18:37.380
is the most likely suspect.

995
01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:39.716
But what do I know?

996
01:18:41.592 --> 01:18:46.347
All I know is, I'd have to rob a bank
to give a girl a necklace like that.


997
01:18:47.807 --> 01:18:49.767
More champagne?

998
01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:56.065
It's just a thought.

999
01:18:57.942 --> 01:19:01.446
What about carpentry?
You've got a talent for furniture.


1000
01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:05.408
Remember the doll house you built
for the girls?


1001
01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:09.746
Would you ask a heart surgeon
to sell shoes?


1002
01:19:10.037 --> 01:19:13.166
Or ask an astronaut to make sausages?

1003
01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:17.086
You can't compare
heart surgery to acting.


1004
01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:20.006
Of course not.
Acting takes years of training.


1005
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.151
OFFSHORE BANKING

1006
01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:51.953
Shit!

1007
01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:00.338
Are you okay?
- I...


1008
01:20:00.922 --> 01:20:02.924
swallowed my chewing gum.

1009
01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:05.218
Car.

1010
01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:13.017
Oh, shit!

1011
01:20:13.184 --> 01:20:15.311
Shit, shit, shit!

1012
01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:22.235
Okay, I understand.
The thing is...


1013
01:20:22.944 --> 01:20:25.154
Chris can't move.

1014
01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:27.114
He can't move!

1015
01:20:34.789 --> 01:20:37.667
Crap! Hey, you have to get up!
- I can't!


1016
01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:40.962
I think I'm paralyzed.
Oh, God, I'm paralyzed!


1017
01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:43.673
I'll never fuck again!

1018
01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.551
It's not that bad, trust me.
- Not that bad?


1019
01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.594
Can you feel this?

1020
01:20:50.805 --> 01:20:53.766
Heinrich?
- Good, you're not paralyzed. It's shock.


1021
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:59.522
I'll help you out of here, okay?
On three. One, two...


1022
01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:00.856
three!

1023
01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:37.435
Holy shit! Suzanne!

1024
01:21:38.019 --> 01:21:39.770
Chris!

1025
01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:44.567
You're Mrs Schumacher?
- Last time I checked.


1026
01:21:44.984 --> 01:21:48.154
God, was that a 7 iron?
- A 5 iron. Too much swing?


1027
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:52.783
I didn't feel a thing.
- Can you tell me why you're in my house?


1028
01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:55.411
It's a long story.
- Do I want to hear it?


1029
01:21:58.706 --> 01:22:02.835
Once you said you wanted
your husband to disappear.


1030
01:22:03.336 --> 01:22:05.504
I that still true?
- More than ever.


1031
01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:08.591
Very good!
Then you never saw me.


1032
01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:11.135
I was never here, okay?

1033
01:22:11.302 --> 01:22:14.013
Just trust me. 
I'll see myself out.

1034
01:22:20.061 --> 01:22:22.980
What took so long?
- I was having a conference.


1035
01:22:23.314 --> 01:22:25.274
A conference?

1036
01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:34.241
What happened?
Are you guys okay?


1037
01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:39.622
Mission accomplished.
I'll explain later, okay'?


1038
01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:43.209
You okay?
- Yeah.


1039
01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:46.337
When I was 18 I told my father

1040
01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:50.383
I'd never accept another cent from him,
and I haven't.


1041
01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.511
Did he accept that?
- No.


1042
01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:58.224
He hated it. His money was like a leash
he used to control me.


1043
01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:01.394
But I wanted... to be free.
- To be free.


1044
01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:04.563
I know about that.
This is where I live.


1045
01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:13.990
I'm sorry for how I acted tonight.
It was just...


1046
01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:16.701
Terrible.
- Yes, terrible.


1047
01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:21.163
I just haven't been on a date in so long,
and I needed some liquid courage.


1048
01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:30.172
It was a great night.
- I think so, too.


1049
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:35.011
Let's do that again.
- The date?


1050
01:23:36.429 --> 01:23:39.181
Or the kiss, maybe?
- Yeah, maybe.


1051
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.949
We've got them.
- Who? -The bank robbers.


1052
01:23:57.366 --> 01:24:02.329
Marked bills were used at a gas station,
and one of the guys has a wrist tattoo!


1053
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:05.791
The Japanese symbol for "universe."
- Yes!


1054
01:24:10.838 --> 01:24:14.300
When did the robbery occur?
- The Friday before last.


1055
01:24:14.842 --> 01:24:18.429
The Friday before last.
- Why did you choose that day?


1056
01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:25.519
"Moving day" is a term
only used by bank employees.


1057
01:24:26.353 --> 01:24:29.899
Did someone give you insider information?
- Yes.


1058
01:24:30.775 --> 01:24:31.942
Yes.

1059
01:24:35.821 --> 01:24:38.157
Is it this man?
- Him?


1060
01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:40.701
I've never seen him before.
- No.


1061
01:24:44.455 --> 01:24:46.665
Then who is it'?

1062
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:52.713
Who is the insider?

1063
01:24:55.132 --> 01:24:57.426
Heinrich Schumacher.

1064
01:25:05.935 --> 01:25:09.522
What do you think you're doing?
- I have a search warrant.


1065
01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:14.401
Like hell, you do!
I play golf with the senior prosecutor.


1066
01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:18.155
I think I'll give him a call!
- Do that. Call him.


1067
01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:21.367
He signed the warrant.
- Dr. Zollner?


1068
01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:24.161
You'd better take a look at this.

1069
01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:33.170
Just a minute!
I've never seen this bag in my life!


1070
01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:37.174
Were you planning on taking a trip?
- Me? No. Why do you ask?


1071
01:25:37.383 --> 01:25:40.010
Those passports don't belong to me!

1072
01:25:40.136 --> 01:25:42.513
We'll see about that.
- But...


1073
01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:50.187
Allegedly, Schumacher, who directs
one of Germany's most successful banks,


1074
01:25:50.396 --> 01:25:54.859
was found in possession of

1075
01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:58.028
A source from the Berlin police force
has confirmed


1076
01:25:58.195 --> 01:26:01.740
that Schumacher had contacted
several offshore banks


1077
01:26:01.866 --> 01:26:04.326
in an attempt to launder the money.

1078
01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:08.455
Schumacher and his two accomplices
face long jail sentences.


1079
01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:13.252
A NEW MAIL FROM MAD MAX.

1080
01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:17.673
WE HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL EVENING.
CAN WE MEET AGAIN? YOURS, MAX


1081
01:26:25.222 --> 01:26:27.558
Excuse me.
What do you think?


1082
01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:30.603
Should we keep looking
for the missing money?


1083
01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:33.522
No, it's an insurance case now.

1084
01:26:33.856 --> 01:26:37.943
I've got orders from the top.
We lack the manpower to keep looking.


1085
01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:39.737
Okay.

1086
01:27:19.443 --> 01:27:21.445
What's that?

1087
01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:25.574
No, I couldn't possibly...
- No discussion.


1088
01:27:26.742 --> 01:27:28.911
That's your cut.

1089
01:27:29.078 --> 01:27:32.248
Really, I can't.
- Tobias, we're a team!


1090
01:27:33.082 --> 01:27:35.251
Okay?
- Come on.


1091
01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.544
To us.
- To the team.


1092
01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:39.546
To the team.

1093
01:27:41.632 --> 01:27:44.260
It's a nice place, huh?

1094
01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:48.222
Schumacher's getting his balls
welded to his ass in jail right now!


1095
01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:51.308
Karma!
- I knew a girl named Karma.


1096
01:27:51.517 --> 01:27:54.895
She was a stripper. What a babe!
Even you'd get naked for her!


1097
01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:58.357
A stadium and the pope saw me naked.
I don't care anymore.


1098
01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:03.362
You know what?
We're like the...


1099
01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:07.700
The Magnificent Four.
- "The Magnificent Four"? Really?


1100
01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:10.536
Not you, wimp. 
I count twice.

1101
01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:14.081
You always have to count twice.
What's that over there?


1102
01:28:14.415 --> 01:28:16.166
Where?
- Look!


1103
01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:26.885
Okay, got it. Okay, I will.
Elizabeth?


1104
01:28:27.553 --> 01:28:30.556
Start filling the bathtub, okay?

1105
01:28:30.723 --> 01:28:33.851
Ok, sweetie. Bye-bye.
So, guys, see you next week.


1106
01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:38.897
Oh, Elisabeth gave a talk
at Imperial Bank today.


1107
01:28:40.566 --> 01:28:44.445
She said the bank
is full of arrogant con artists.


1108
01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:48.240
Compared to them,
Schumacher's the Dalai Lama.


1109
01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:52.578
How is he a lama?
- You mean as far as karma goes...


1110
01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:55.414
They're um...

1111
01:28:55.956 --> 01:28:57.958
due for a withdrawal?

1112
01:29:00.294 --> 01:29:04.340
What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. -Nothing at all...
