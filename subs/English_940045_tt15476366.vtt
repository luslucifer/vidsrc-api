Trudy, right?

55
00:03:57.317 --> 00:03:59.181
Told me all about you, girl.

56
00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:01.183
Heard you're a real pain
in the ass.


57
00:04:01.217 --> 00:04:02.908
They were'nt wrong.

Oh...

59
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.812
Did you grab my stuff?

60
00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:45.986
Just a notebook.

61
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.952
Gotta stay off the grid.

Put those on.

It's just like we practiced
at home, bumblebee.


68

That's good.


72

Silent voice, baby.

73
00:05:34.414 --> 00:05:35.484
Does that feel okay?

74
00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:36.933
I don't wanna do it.

75
00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:39.350
We don't have a choice.

76
00:05:39.384 --> 00:05:40.696
Get into position. We're here.

77
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.731
No!

Before I leave you,
some basic house rules.


157
00:15:58.278 --> 00:16:01.212
Under no circumstances
should you leave the house.


158
00:16:01.247 --> 00:16:03.249
While you're sleeping,
the lights need to be off.


159
00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:06.390
You wanna know why
this place was selected


160
00:16:06.424 --> 00:16:08.495
to hide such
an important individual?


161
00:16:10.946 --> 00:16:12.637
Because people are terrified
of it.


162
00:17:07.347 --> 00:17:09.039
Found the water pump.

163

wanna come sleep with us?

00:17:22.707 --> 00:17:24.571
Hm?

167
00:17:24.606 --> 00:17:26.711
You have mommy now.

168
00:17:26.746 --> 00:17:29.507
- Sweetheart...
No.


169
00:17:29.542 --> 00:17:31.302
No, no, no, no, no, no.

170
00:17:31.337 --> 00:17:32.510
No.

171
00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:36.514
Me, you, and mommy,
we are one unit.


172
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:37.999
Okay?

173
00:17:38.033 --> 00:17:39.345
You know what that means, right?

174
00:17:39.379 --> 00:17:41.174
Yeah, family.

175
00:17:41.209 --> 00:17:43.211
Yeah, that's right.

176
00:17:43.245 --> 00:17:44.246
Positive zone.

177
00:17:44.281 --> 00:17:47.387
Pshhh.

178
00:17:47.422 --> 00:17:48.975
Phew.

179
00:18:28.256 --> 00:18:30.775
This is a five-year-old
school lunch.


180
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.226
It's definitely better
than the crap I was eating.


181
00:18:34.503 --> 00:18:36.436
You want some cheese, Benny?

182
00:18:36.471 --> 00:18:38.197
He doesn't like cheese.

183
00:18:38.231 --> 00:18:39.163
What does he like?

184
00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:41.821
Carrots.

185
00:18:41.855 --> 00:18:43.305
Come here. Come here, boy.

186
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.756
Oh-
- Oh, that's a good boy.

187
00:18:47.413 --> 00:18:50.623
- Rubbery cheese, smell of death.

188
00:18:50.657 --> 00:18:52.073
- Poop water.

189
00:18:52.107 --> 00:18:53.177
We'll make the best of it, right?

190
00:18:53.212 --> 00:18:54.109
Poop water.

191
00:18:54.144 --> 00:18:55.283
Poopy water.

192
00:18:56.767 --> 00:18:58.700
I know this sucks,
but it's just one night.


193
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.324
It's just one night...

194
00:19:02.359 --> 00:19:03.463
- Mm.
- To fall for you.


195
00:19:03.498 --> 00:19:06.397
No. I didn't know it could be
true.


196
00:19:06.432 --> 00:19:07.847
But I just can't help
this feeling.


197
00:19:07.881 --> 00:19:10.263
Oh, it's...

198
00:19:10.298 --> 00:19:12.265
Oh, that's that song
that played on our first date


199
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.749
on that jukebox.

200
00:19:13.784 --> 00:19:16.235
What's a jukebox?

201
00:19:16.269 --> 00:19:18.064
It's a vending machine
for music.


202
00:19:18.099 --> 00:19:19.514
What's a vending machine?

203
00:19:21.136 --> 00:19:24.450
Come here.
You curious little kid.


204
00:19:24.484 --> 00:19:25.830
I missed you.

205
00:19:34.494 --> 00:19:36.807
Why don't you call it a night?

206
00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:38.326
I've to catch up
on all this work


207
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.534
when I get to base camp.

208
00:19:40.845 --> 00:19:42.640
Really, I should be out there
fighting.


209
00:19:45.229 --> 00:19:46.506
I feel like such a coward.

210
00:19:47.749 --> 00:19:49.406
Well, you have a family now.

211
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.718
You're not a 20-year-old
activist anymore.


212
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:55.757
I feel useless.

213
00:19:57.414 --> 00:19:58.829
I have nothing to focus on.

214
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.420
Well, you have Daria.
Why don't you focus on her?


215
00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:08.839
Two!

216
00:20:09.943 --> 00:20:11.221
Yeah.

217
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.847
Six!

218
00:20:19.643 --> 00:20:21.334
Let's do it one more time.

219
00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:27.340
Five.

220
00:20:29.618 --> 00:20:31.241
How are you getting them all?

221
00:20:31.275 --> 00:20:32.656
The boy is helping me.

222
00:20:33.864 --> 00:20:35.245
What boy?

223
00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:37.488
The one standing behind you.

224
00:20:49.776 --> 00:20:52.158
Come on, bedtime.

225
00:20:52.193 --> 00:20:54.402
Why was your picture
on the billboard?


226
00:20:55.575 --> 00:20:56.818
Daddy didn't tell you?

227
00:20:59.683 --> 00:21:00.891
Okay.

228
00:21:02.686 --> 00:21:04.170
Well...

229
00:21:08.795 --> 00:21:10.452
mommy wrote a book

230
00:21:10.487 --> 00:21:12.420
that made a lot
of people very angry.


231
00:21:12.454 --> 00:21:13.697
Which people?

232
00:21:15.008 --> 00:21:16.424
People in power.

233
00:21:18.633 --> 00:21:20.600
Are you going back to the jail?

234
00:21:22.464 --> 00:21:23.879
Is that what youre
worried about?


235
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:32.302
I'm here, with you.

236
00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:34.925
Promise.

237
00:21:36.858 --> 00:21:38.860
You know, it's not easy leaving
all your friends.


238
00:21:40.517 --> 00:21:42.312
You're handling it really well.

239
00:21:43.589 --> 00:21:44.693
Proud of you.

240
00:21:46.592 --> 00:21:48.456
Daddy says I'm a tough girl.

241
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:49.560
You are.

242
00:21:50.803 --> 00:21:52.598
Wow.

243
00:22:17.692 --> 00:22:18.796
How's it looking?

244
00:22:21.696 --> 00:22:23.387
Filter was bad.

245
00:22:23.422 --> 00:22:25.734
This should give us
some clean water.


246
00:22:25.769 --> 00:22:27.633
Oh, come on!

247
00:22:30.429 --> 00:22:31.878
Here, hand me that flathead.

248
00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:38.989
Alright.

249
00:22:41.405 --> 00:22:42.579
Let's give it a shot.

250
00:22:45.478 --> 00:22:46.445
Come on.

251
00:22:47.825 --> 00:22:48.792
Oh, yeah.
- Boom!


252
00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:50.034
Hey!

253
00:22:50.069 --> 00:22:52.692
Hey, hey.

254
00:22:52.727 --> 00:22:54.280
Clean water.

255
00:22:54.315 --> 00:22:55.523
Here we go.
- Oh.


256
00:22:55.557 --> 00:22:56.558
Say, thank you daddy.

257
00:22:56.593 --> 00:22:58.526
Thank you, daddy.

258
00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.803
Yes.

259
00:23:01.908 --> 00:23:03.427
Crystal clear.

260
00:23:03.462 --> 00:23:04.394
Hmm.

261
00:23:05.636 --> 00:23:07.500
- Here you go.
Alright.


262
00:23:07.535 --> 00:23:08.674
Hm, alright.

263
00:23:08.708 --> 00:23:10.262
See what's up?

264
00:23:12.574 --> 00:23:13.851
What the hell is this?

265
00:23:38.082 --> 00:23:39.532
Oh my God.

266
00:23:45.469 --> 00:23:46.919
Fuck that thing.

267
00:23:54.167 --> 00:23:55.997
It's not the hood
that bothers me.


268
00:23:56.031 --> 00:23:57.688
It's the animals that wear it.

269
00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:44.494
Daria.

270
00:24:44.528 --> 00:24:45.702
Hey! Come here!

271
00:24:53.019 --> 00:24:54.435
Daria!

272
00:25:59.154 --> 00:26:00.604
Daria!

273
00:26:00.639 --> 00:26:02.675
Never do that again!

274
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.987
Look at me!

275
00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:05.678
This is not a toy!

276
00:26:05.713 --> 00:26:07.128
Right, hey.

277
00:26:07.162 --> 00:26:08.819
Go to your room.

278
00:26:08.854 --> 00:26:10.096
She's 6.

279
00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:11.926
You cut her some slack,
for Christ's sake.


280
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.514
She needs to know this is wrong.

281
00:26:13.548 --> 00:26:15.757
Yeah, well, she doesn't respond
well to yelling.


282
00:26:44.234 --> 00:26:46.270
<i>Cain's Bonafide Apple Pie.</i>

283
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.103
<i>Using only 100% pure
white Cain sugar.</i>


284
00:26:53.588 --> 00:26:56.073
<i>Combine seven or eight cups
of sliced apples.</i>


285
00:26:57.903 --> 00:27:01.182
<i>Half a cup of 100% Cain's
pure white sugar.</i>


286

<i>One stick of salted butter.</i>

287
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:08.707
<i>And arrange in Cain's
original pastry shell.</i>


288
00:27:10.087 --> 00:27:11.675
<i>You'll be screaming for more.</i>

289
00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:06.013
Ron?

290
00:31:08.878 --> 00:31:10.086
Ron?

291
00:31:15.539 --> 00:31:16.817
Benny?

292
00:31:28.414 --> 00:31:29.450
Trudy?

293
00:31:31.383 --> 00:31:32.522
Trudy?

294
00:31:35.007 --> 00:31:36.560
Trudy?

295
00:31:36.595 --> 00:31:38.079
Hey.

296
00:31:38.114 --> 00:31:39.322
Benny got out.

297
00:31:46.847 --> 00:31:48.227
Wait, maybe he got out.

298
00:31:56.649 --> 00:31:58.134
Why is the door open?

299
00:31:58.168 --> 00:31:59.894
I don't know.

300
00:31:59.929 --> 00:32:01.206
Stay inside.

301
00:32:37.898 --> 00:32:39.175
Benny?

302
00:34:17.238 --> 00:34:18.239
I'm sorry.

303
00:34:19.792 --> 00:34:21.104
Where's Benny?

304
00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:22.174
Benny got out.

305
00:34:23.658 --> 00:34:25.522
How did that happen?

306
00:34:25.557 --> 00:34:27.110
Door was left wide open.

307
00:34:27.145 --> 00:34:28.525
I didn't see him outside.

308
00:34:30.493 --> 00:34:31.494
Give me the goggles.
I'm gonna go look.


309
00:34:31.528 --> 00:34:33.151
Nobody's going outside.

310
00:34:33.185 --> 00:34:34.359
Yes, I am.

311
00:34:34.393 --> 00:34:35.567
No, you're not.

312
00:34:35.601 --> 00:34:36.982
It's not safe.

313
00:34:37.017 --> 00:34:38.639
Stop talking to me
like I'm a child.


314
00:34:38.673 --> 00:34:40.227
I'm not.

00:36:07.624 --> 00:36:09.488
Go again. Over.

335
00:36:09.523 --> 00:36:11.663
<i>We are negative
for extraction.</i>


336
00:36:11.697 --> 00:36:13.182
<i>NAF has checkpoints
all the way up</i>


337
00:36:13.216 --> 00:36:14.217
<i>to the Canadian border.</i>

338
00:36:14.252 --> 00:36:15.322
<i>Pine Creek is fucked.</i>

339
00:36:15.356 --> 00:36:17.393
<i>There are protests about
the executions.</i>


340
00:36:17.427 --> 00:36:20.120
<i>It's just-- it's too risky right
now. Over.</i>


341
00:36:20.154 --> 00:36:22.156
Figure out a way
to get us as scheduled.


342
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.194
Hey, I have a 6-year-old here.

343
00:36:25.228 --> 00:36:26.781
We're not waiting any longer.

344
00:36:26.816 --> 00:36:28.404
Can you re-route us?

345
00:36:28.438 --> 00:36:30.371
Over.

346
00:36:30.406 --> 00:36:31.786
<i>Resistance open up...</i>

347
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.207
<i>Over.</i>

348
00:36:43.212 --> 00:36:46.111
Radio back with an ETA
when you have one.


349
00:36:46.146 --> 00:36:47.319
Over.

350
00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:54.878
Dammit!

351
00:36:59.504 --> 00:37:01.161
I say we take our chances
and get out of here.


352
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.128
Maybe one of your crew can

353
00:37:03.163 --> 00:37:04.440
navigate us through the back
roads.


354
00:37:04.474 --> 00:37:06.511
I'm not looking to get
into a gamble.


355
00:37:06.545 --> 00:37:07.753
We don't know how long
it'll take.


356
00:37:07.788 --> 00:37:09.376
- Unless you have a better idea.
- It's gonna take them--


357
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:10.618
RON [OS/ON]:
What, we're just gonna sit here?


358
00:37:10.653 --> 00:37:12.448
We have no idea.
It could be weeks.


359
00:37:12.482 --> 00:37:13.483
We could be waiting here.
We-- I'm not gonna wait here.


360
00:37:13.518 --> 00:37:14.933
Unless we have a better idea,
I say we wait.


361
00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:16.693
Would you listen to me?

362
00:37:23.252 --> 00:37:25.668
Unless you have a better idea,
we wait here


363
00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:27.601
until it's safe for them
to get us.


364
00:37:31.605 --> 00:37:33.538
This is the only option
right now.


365
00:38:09.505 --> 00:38:10.747
You look tired.

366
00:38:12.887 --> 00:38:14.613
I'm fine.

367
00:38:14.648 --> 00:38:16.305
Trying to send a message
to base camp.


368
00:38:23.277 --> 00:38:24.623
Okay.

369
00:38:27.799 --> 00:38:29.939
Base camp, this is T.

370
00:38:29.973 --> 00:38:32.459
We need to dispatch a message
from Luxembourg.


371
00:38:32.493 --> 00:38:33.805
Over.

372
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:37.843
<i>Uh, copy that T.</i>

373
00:38:37.878 --> 00:38:39.500
<i>Comms are go.
We are ready to receive.</i>


374
00:38:39.535 --> 00:38:40.708
<i>Over.</i>

375
00:38:46.749 --> 00:38:48.544
This is Luxembourg.

376
00:38:48.578 --> 00:38:50.511
A quick update.

377
00:38:50.546 --> 00:38:51.892
As many of you know by now,

378
00:38:51.926 --> 00:38:54.343
I am out
of even political prison,


379
00:38:54.377 --> 00:38:56.793
with the help of The Resistance.

380
00:38:56.828 --> 00:38:58.761
We are in
an undisclosed location


381
00:38:58.795 --> 00:38:59.831
with my husband and daughter.

382
00:39:01.419 --> 00:39:03.041
We will be relocating
to base camp


383
00:39:03.075 --> 00:39:04.456
where we will continue
the fight.


384
00:39:05.768 --> 00:39:10.221
Please keep organizing,
keep resisting.


385
00:39:11.843 --> 00:39:13.741
We are strong in numbers.

386
00:40:01.479 --> 00:40:02.376
You okay?

387
00:40:03.446 --> 00:40:05.068
Can't sleep.

388
00:40:05.103 --> 00:40:08.934
Well, you're probably
just a little anxious.


389
00:40:08.969 --> 00:40:10.971
Hey, positive zone.

390
00:40:16.114 --> 00:40:17.667
Hey.

391
00:40:21.913 --> 00:40:23.328
You sure, you don't wanna come
sleep with us?


392
00:40:24.605 --> 00:40:26.538
Okay.

393
00:40:26.573 --> 00:40:28.920
Alright. Well, look,
why don't you lay down.


394
00:40:28.954 --> 00:40:30.956
Come on, lay down.

395
00:40:30.991 --> 00:40:32.648
Okay.

396
00:40:32.682 --> 00:40:34.408
And try the-- the counting
thing that we talked about.


397
00:40:34.443 --> 00:40:35.720
Okay.

398
00:40:35.754 --> 00:40:39.551

402
00:40:48.457 --> 00:40:49.527
Perfect.

403
00:40:49.561 --> 00:40:51.011
Okay, keep going.

404
00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:56.050
Good night.

418
00:42:08.088 --> 00:42:10.470
I have something
for you in a minute.


419
00:42:10.504 --> 00:42:11.712
But first,

420
00:42:16.165 --> 00:42:19.651
take this up
to the room in the hallway.


421
00:42:19.686 --> 00:42:21.101
Slide it through the slider.

422
00:42:23.137 --> 00:42:24.553
You want some?

423
00:43:42.078 --> 00:43:43.666
Marriage is a slog, ain't it?

424
00:43:45.565 --> 00:43:46.945
I was in love with my wife.

425
00:43:48.222 --> 00:43:49.638
Till I wasn't.

426
00:43:51.916 --> 00:43:54.263
Is that who's locked
in that room?


427
00:43:54.297 --> 00:43:56.645
Yeah, that's her.

428
00:43:56.679 --> 00:43:58.647
Cunt tried to turn my own son
against me.


429
00:44:00.062 --> 00:44:01.960
Why?

430
00:44:01.995 --> 00:44:03.583
Her and Steven think I'm wrong.

431
00:44:04.722 --> 00:44:06.033
Trying to protect the culture.

432
00:44:12.074 --> 00:44:14.663
Would you like a slice
of pie, Ron?


433
00:44:21.014 --> 00:44:22.084
I'm okay.

434
00:44:23.395 --> 00:44:24.811
No, you're not.

435
00:44:27.089 --> 00:44:28.677
Come on.

436
00:44:28.711 --> 00:44:29.988
Sit down.

437
00:44:30.023 --> 00:44:31.680
Come on, sit down.

438
00:44:39.929 --> 00:44:42.967
That's Cain's bona fide
apple pie.


439
00:44:44.175 --> 00:44:45.970
Don't get no better
than that.


440
00:45:16.345 --> 00:45:17.829
That old black woman.

441
00:45:20.798 --> 00:45:23.248
Her and your wife despise men
like us.


442
00:45:27.874 --> 00:45:29.703
You ever hear the stories
of Br'er Rabbit?


443
00:45:32.085 --> 00:45:34.812
I loved Br'er Rabbit
when I was a kid.


444
00:45:34.846 --> 00:45:37.297
Br'er Rabbit
and Br'er Fox.


445
00:45:37.331 --> 00:45:41.197
This old black slave
telling these stories


446
00:45:41.232 --> 00:45:42.751
to a little white boy.

447
00:45:48.411 --> 00:45:50.103
I got one sort of like that.

448
00:45:53.037 --> 00:45:54.210
You wanna hear?

449
00:45:58.318 --> 00:45:59.353
Not so long ago,

450
00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.356
right out in these woods
right here,


451
00:46:02.391 --> 00:46:04.393
there was a family
of foxes.


452
00:46:04.427 --> 00:46:05.843
Three of 'em,

453
00:46:05.877 --> 00:46:08.949
Mama Fox, Papa Fox,
and their little male pup.


454
00:46:10.502 --> 00:46:11.849
Cute little things.

455
00:46:13.229 --> 00:46:15.128
Father Fox would go out
and hunt.


456
00:46:15.162 --> 00:46:18.890
Bring food to the vixen fox
and her pup every day.


457
00:46:20.409 --> 00:46:23.239
And then one day,
the Mama Fox and the pup


458
00:46:24.793 --> 00:46:28.693
saw this rabbit caught
in a stream, struggling.


459
00:46:28.728 --> 00:46:29.901
Couldn't make it up the bank.

460
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.317
So they stopped

461
00:46:32.352 --> 00:46:34.078
and they helped
the rabbit out.


462
00:46:34.112 --> 00:46:35.389
Saving the rabbit's life.

463
00:46:36.977 --> 00:46:40.705
Instead of helping Papa Fox
hunt more food,


464
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.155
they helped the rabbit.

465
00:46:43.743 --> 00:46:45.261
Papa Fox saw this.

466
00:46:45.296 --> 00:46:47.401
Ate the Mama Fox
and his own pup.


467
00:46:48.851 --> 00:46:50.819
Blood, guts, their hands,
all of it.


468
00:46:54.857 --> 00:46:56.031
Couldn't allow it.

469
00:46:58.481 --> 00:47:00.207
Wasn't really about the rabbit.

470
00:47:03.348 --> 00:47:04.418
How is it?

471
00:47:07.387 --> 00:47:08.837
Best thing I've had in days.

472
00:47:19.433 --> 00:47:20.711
I should get going.

473
00:47:22.264 --> 00:47:23.368
Huh.

474
00:47:29.064 --> 00:47:30.237
Hey Ron,

475
00:47:33.827 --> 00:47:36.105
don't let your wife
make you less of a man.


476
00:47:39.005 --> 00:47:40.351
They're good at doing that.

477
00:50:57.237 --> 00:50:58.376
Come on, baby.

478
00:50:58.411 --> 00:51:00.240
We gotta go come on.
Come on, hurry.


479
00:51:00.275 --> 00:51:01.172
Get in the closet.

480
00:51:01.207 --> 00:51:03.036
Daria! Go!

481
00:51:11.803 --> 00:51:12.735
Danny come on, let's go.

482
00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:15.186
Okay.

483
00:51:17.016 --> 00:51:19.052
Dear Heavenly Father, I just
asked that you watch over us


484
00:51:19.087 --> 00:51:20.743
today as we carry out
your work, Lord.


485
00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:22.987
I ask that you keep an eye out
on my men.


486
00:51:23.022 --> 00:51:25.369
And surround us
with Your protecting light.


487
00:51:25.403 --> 00:51:27.267
And lastly Heavenly Father,

488
00:51:27.302 --> 00:51:29.718
I just want to thank you
for the opportunity


489
00:51:29.752 --> 00:51:32.410
to protect this county
from tyranny and from evil.


490
00:51:32.445 --> 00:51:33.687
All God's people said...

491
00:51:33.722 --> 00:51:34.723
- Amen.
- Amen.


492
00:51:34.757 --> 00:51:35.724
Let's go.

493
00:51:43.766 --> 00:51:46.217
Hey guys,
what can I do for you?


494
00:51:48.599 --> 00:51:50.118
Afternoon, sir.

495
00:51:50.152 --> 00:51:51.671
I'm Brad Larkin.

496
00:51:51.705 --> 00:51:53.328
This is Kevin Johnson.

497
00:51:53.362 --> 00:51:54.812
We got Williams.

498
00:51:54.846 --> 00:51:56.055
He's a convert.

499
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:57.608
And of course,
I got Tyler Miller.


500
00:51:57.642 --> 00:51:59.092
And we're here,
'cause we have reason to believe


501
00:51:59.127 --> 00:52:00.783
a Resistance fugitive
came through.


502
00:52:11.656 --> 00:52:13.555
Don't know 'em.

503
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:16.316
Well, we think they might
be hiding on your property.


504
00:52:16.351 --> 00:52:19.526
My boys here, well...

505
00:52:19.561 --> 00:52:22.391
they're hungry to capture
and kill one said fugitive.


506
00:52:22.426 --> 00:52:23.772
Hungry is an understatement.

507
00:52:23.806 --> 00:52:25.291
I got a fucking heart on
to kill 'em.


508
00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:30.813
- Hm.
- Can I scan your finger?


509
00:52:30.848 --> 00:52:32.160
Yeah.

510
00:52:35.749 --> 00:52:37.027
Dale Thompson.

511
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.171
Alright. We're gonna do a quick
search of the property.


512
00:52:43.205 --> 00:52:44.482
And then we'll be
on our way.


513
00:52:46.691 --> 00:52:47.761
Yeah. Come on in.

514
00:52:58.565 --> 00:53:00.809
We don't usually travel this
far off the grid.


515
00:53:04.571 --> 00:53:06.366
You know, most people
don't even know


516
00:53:06.401 --> 00:53:08.196
houses like this still exist.

517
00:53:09.818 --> 00:53:11.233
Let alone live in 'em.

518
00:53:15.203 --> 00:53:18.447
Well, what makes you think
they came through here?


519
00:53:18.482 --> 00:53:20.415
A drone caught somebody
in the front yard.


520
00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:23.142
Oh.

521
00:53:24.557 --> 00:53:25.592
You know,
when I was in the army,


522
00:53:25.627 --> 00:53:27.249
we used to get glitches
like that all the time


523
00:53:27.284 --> 00:53:28.181
on our devices.

524
00:53:29.355 --> 00:53:30.632
You served?

525
00:53:30.666 --> 00:53:32.737
That's right.

526
00:53:32.772 --> 00:53:34.187
Two tours in the NAF War.

527
00:53:35.361 --> 00:53:36.534
What unit?

528
00:53:38.709 --> 00:53:41.160
First Infantry Six Battalion
Charlie Company.


529
00:53:44.577 --> 00:53:46.337
I bet it was hot in Texas, huh?

530
00:53:48.374 --> 00:53:50.445
You mean Kansas, right?

531
00:53:54.863 --> 00:53:56.278
<i>T, come in.</i>

532
00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.764
<i>T, do you copy? Over.</i>

533
00:54:05.391 --> 00:54:06.357
<i>T, this is ba--</i>

534
00:54:06.392 --> 00:54:07.462
Hey fellas.

535
00:54:07.496 --> 00:54:08.773
I got some company
right here now.


536
00:54:08.808 --> 00:54:10.913
I'll radio you after. Over.

537
00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:15.159
Who's T?

538
00:54:18.404 --> 00:54:19.612
T for Thompson.

539
00:54:21.821 --> 00:54:23.650
You don't really live here,
do you?


540
00:54:23.685 --> 00:54:24.789
This place is a dump.

541
00:54:24.824 --> 00:54:26.515
Hey!

542
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:27.930
What did I tell you?

543
00:54:27.965 --> 00:54:29.725
Professionalism.

544
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.934
Go search the rest
of the house.


545
00:54:31.969 --> 00:54:33.488
Go.

546
00:54:42.393 --> 00:54:43.843
How long you guys planning
on being here?


547
00:54:43.877 --> 00:54:46.190
Hmm.
You want us out so fast, huh?


548
00:54:47.398 --> 00:54:48.744
Well,
normally I shoot trespassers


549
00:54:48.779 --> 00:54:51.299
just casually walking up
on my property.


550
00:54:51.333 --> 00:54:52.576
Why didn't you then?

551
00:54:54.612 --> 00:54:56.373
We're on the same side.

552
00:55:56.743 --> 00:55:58.642
You know, there's one place
that we should check.


553
00:56:03.543 --> 00:56:05.545
Come on, I'll show you.

554
00:57:29.836 --> 00:57:31.528
Shit, man.

555
00:57:31.562 --> 00:57:33.564
You're the real fucking deal.

556
00:57:33.599 --> 00:57:35.773
Sorry about the hassle, brother.

557
00:57:35.808 --> 00:57:37.465
Respect man.

558
00:57:39.121 --> 00:57:40.191
I get why you're cautious now,

559
00:57:40.226 --> 00:57:42.435
but you don't have to worry
about that with us.


560
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:44.368
That shit's old school, man.

561
00:57:44.403 --> 00:57:46.439
Let me guess. It was your
granddad or your great granddad?


562
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:50.685
Yeah.
Yeah, my uh, my granddad.


563
00:57:53.066 --> 00:57:54.999
Alright, man. If you see
anything, let me know.


564
00:57:55.034 --> 00:57:56.622
We'll be on Channel 3.

565
00:58:06.459 --> 00:58:07.909
Base camp, it's T.

566
00:58:09.048 --> 00:58:10.532
Over.

567
00:58:15.951 --> 00:58:17.159
Base camp, it's T.

568
00:58:17.194 --> 00:58:18.160
Over.

569
00:58:21.543 --> 00:58:22.889
<i>We're still here.
Still here, T.</i>


570
00:58:22.924 --> 00:58:24.857
<i>Do you copy? Over.</i>

571
00:58:24.891 --> 00:58:26.030
Yes, copy.

572
00:58:26.065 --> 00:58:28.067
We just had militia
come through.


573
00:58:28.101 --> 00:58:30.725
We need you guys to get us out
as soon as it's clear.


574
00:58:30.759 --> 00:58:32.174
Over.

575
00:58:32.209 --> 00:58:33.555
<i>Shit. Copy that.</i>

576
00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:35.108
<i>Is uh-- is everybody okay?</i>

577
00:58:35.143 --> 00:58:37.041
<i>Over.</i>

578
00:58:37.076 --> 00:58:38.526
Yeah, we're okay.

579
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.424
Over.

580
00:58:40.459 --> 00:58:41.839
<i>Good. Listen up.</i>

581
00:58:41.874 --> 00:58:43.910
<i>Extraction team is remobilizing.</i>

<i>Should be to your position

583
00:58:45.947 --> 00:58:47.707
<i>Maybe two tops.</i>

584
00:58:47.742 --> 00:58:50.123
<i>We are coming to get you.</i>

585
00:58:50.158 --> 00:58:52.919
<i>Just make sure when we call,
you answer.</i>


586
00:58:52.954 --> 00:58:55.059
<i>Otherwise, the mission is off.
Over.</i>


587
00:58:55.094 --> 00:58:56.992
We will, over.

588
00:58:57.027 --> 00:58:58.477

I build community.

606
01:01:45.229 --> 01:01:47.404
I bring people together
to talk about things,


607

Open the door.

Hey bumblebee!

628
01:03:19.116 --> 01:03:20.117
Open the door.

630
01:03:22.464 --> 01:03:23.880
Okay.

We'll be here when you're ready
to come out.

01:03:30.196 --> 01:03:31.439
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?


633
01:03:31.473 --> 01:03:33.199
You're just leaving her
and walking away?


634
01:03:33.234 --> 01:03:34.960
God, I'm not leaving her.

635
01:03:34.994 --> 01:03:36.686
She can come out
when she's ready.


636
01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:41.449
Daria, daddy is here with you.

637
01:03:42.899 --> 01:03:44.107
Mommy wants to walk away.

638
01:03:44.141 --> 01:03:46.178
What? Why would you say that?

639
01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:49.388
Just because you have
a certain way of parenting


640
01:03:49.422 --> 01:03:51.804
doesn't mean I have
to do the same thing.


641
01:03:51.839 --> 01:03:53.979
I'm not hurting her
by letting her be in there.


642
01:03:57.223 --> 01:03:59.191
I'm sorry you're upset at us.

643
01:04:02.988 --> 01:04:05.335
We'll be here when you
decide to come out, okay?


644
01:04:07.924 --> 01:04:09.891
Daddy thinks you're upset
because we had to come here,


645
01:04:09.926 --> 01:04:11.306
so mommy doesn't go to jail.

646
01:04:13.999 --> 01:04:15.552
So, why don't you just
come on out


647
01:04:15.586 --> 01:04:17.105
and we can talk about it.

648
01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.244
Okay?

649
01:04:22.076 --> 01:04:23.733
It's okay if you're scared.

650
01:04:25.286 --> 01:04:26.874
Mommy's scared, too.

651
01:04:38.817 --> 01:04:40.094
Hey.

652
01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:55.031
Should have never brought you
and Daria here.


653
01:06:01.554 --> 01:06:03.142
Too late.

654
01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:47.419
"I do not wish death
for my enemies,


655
01:07:47.453 --> 01:07:50.077
only life for my friends."

656
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:10.166
It's good to see you, son.

657
01:08:12.168 --> 01:08:13.479
You look tired.

658
01:08:17.552 --> 01:08:18.657
I'm exhausted.

659
01:08:20.176 --> 01:08:22.419
I would be too
if I were in your shoes.


660
01:08:25.802 --> 01:08:27.631
Misplaced your balls.

661
01:08:33.327 --> 01:08:34.776
Ehm.

662
01:08:34.811 --> 01:08:37.158
You look like a man
with something on his mind.


663
01:08:45.856 --> 01:08:47.997
I think my marriage
is crumbling.


664
01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:52.139
You think?

665
01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:03.529
Remember, you got to take back
your power, Ron.


666
01:09:09.846 --> 01:09:11.537
- You should be a therapist.
Hmm.


667
01:09:12.849 --> 01:09:14.575
Therapy is horse shit, Ron.

668
01:09:16.197 --> 01:09:18.027
I'm on the side
of the species.


669
01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:22.203
I bring guys like us together.

670
01:09:22.238 --> 01:09:24.378
So, our kind doesn't go extinct.

671
01:09:27.415 --> 01:09:28.382
I never thought of it that way.

672
01:09:29.555 --> 01:09:32.144
Well, maybe you should.

673
01:09:32.179 --> 01:09:34.112
Spend a little less time
with that water pump.


674
01:10:10.596 --> 01:10:11.666
What?

675
01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:14.635
Nothing.

676
01:10:18.432 --> 01:10:20.434
I'm actually feeling kind
of energized.


677
01:10:22.608 --> 01:10:26.647
I feel like uh,
I don't really know how to--


678
01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:29.201
how to put it, but uh,

679
01:10:29.236 --> 01:10:30.823
I feel like I don't really give
a fuck anymore.


680
01:10:32.618 --> 01:10:33.723
About any of this.

681
01:10:35.414 --> 01:10:37.175
And I feel like I never really
meant anything to you.


682
01:10:38.383 --> 01:10:39.729
Put the fucking knife down.

683
01:10:41.765 --> 01:10:45.631
I am tired of you making me
feel like less of a man.


684
01:10:51.879 --> 01:10:53.329
That felt great to say.

685
01:11:28.847 --> 01:11:30.331
Base, can you copy?

686
01:11:30.366 --> 01:11:31.470
Over.

687
01:11:37.373 --> 01:11:38.512
Base, I need to hear you.

688
01:11:38.546 --> 01:11:39.616
Over.

689
01:12:38.986 --> 01:12:40.574
Allegra, open the door.

690
01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:23.617
♪ I don't have any money

691
01:13:23.651 --> 01:13:27.448
♪ And I don't have bills
to pay ♪


692
01:13:27.483 --> 01:13:28.932

693
01:13:30.831 --> 01:13:34.869

694
01:13:34.904 --> 01:13:38.597
♪ I don't have a sweetheart

695
01:13:38.632 --> 01:13:42.118
♪ That's a game I don't play

696
01:13:42.152 --> 01:13:45.466
♪ I will keep my sweetheart

697
01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:49.470
♪ 'Cause I like it that way

698
01:15:54.768 --> 01:15:55.838
Drink up, Ron.

699
01:15:57.598 --> 01:15:59.566
I'm drinking up.

700
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.740
Drink up, drink up, drink up.

701
01:16:03.777 --> 01:16:07.263
The old bastard wants
to go home.


702
01:16:07.297 --> 01:16:08.644
Last chance,

703
01:16:08.678 --> 01:16:11.578
last call to drink
the last drop.


704
01:16:11.612 --> 01:16:15.582
Last call, last chance
to drink the last drop.


705
01:16:15.616 --> 01:16:18.688
The old bastard wants
to go home.


706
01:16:18.723 --> 01:16:20.172
The old lady's waiting.

707
01:16:20.207 --> 01:16:22.865
He'd rather kiss Satan.

708
01:16:22.899 --> 01:16:25.281
The old bastard wants
to go home.


709
01:16:25.315 --> 01:16:27.145
Drink up, drink up, drink up.

710
01:16:27.179 --> 01:16:28.802
The old bastard wants
to go home.


711
01:16:28.836 --> 01:16:30.873
- Home.
- The old lady's waiting.


712
01:16:30.907 --> 01:16:32.875
- He'd rather kiss Satan.
- Drink up, drink up, drink up.


713
01:16:32.909 --> 01:16:34.290
Drink up, drink up, drink up.

714
01:16:34.324 --> 01:16:36.016
The old bastard wants
to go home.


715
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:38.570
- Home.
- The old lady's waiting.


716
01:16:38.605 --> 01:16:39.985
He'd rather kiss Satan.

717
01:16:48.235 --> 01:16:49.685
Ah.

718
01:17:02.663 --> 01:17:04.631
The only thing I have
to look forward to in my life


719
01:17:04.665 --> 01:17:05.804
is my daughter.

720
01:17:09.912 --> 01:17:11.638
She's gonna turn out
just like your wife.


721
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:15.918
Break your fucking heart.

722
01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:27.550
I should get going.

723
01:17:27.585 --> 01:17:29.794
Ron. Ron.

724
01:17:29.828 --> 01:17:32.210
Stay. Don't leave me.

725
01:17:32.244 --> 01:17:33.970
You're only half done.

726
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:38.319
I have to get back
to my wife.


727
01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:39.838
To do what?

728
01:17:42.945 --> 01:17:44.015
Ron.

729
01:17:45.637 --> 01:17:48.122
What are you gonna do
with your wife?


730
01:21:59.339 --> 01:22:00.927
Oh.

731
01:22:12.455 --> 01:22:13.560
Bitch!

732
01:22:18.254 --> 01:22:20.463
Ah.

733
01:22:20.498 --> 01:22:22.155
Bitch.

734
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:23.881
Ah.

735
01:22:47.042 --> 01:22:48.491
Ron, put the gun down.

736
01:22:55.705 --> 01:22:57.984
Put the gun down!

737
01:22:58.018 --> 01:22:59.502
Put the gun down!

738
01:23:04.473 --> 01:23:07.510
Oh, put the gun down.

739
01:23:21.593 --> 01:23:23.078
I love you, daddy.

740
01:23:37.575 --> 01:23:38.645
No!

741
01:23:44.202 --> 01:23:46.446
Oh my God.

742
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.517
Oh my God.

743
01:23:58.147 --> 01:24:00.322
Oh my God.

744
01:24:03.428 --> 01:24:05.983
It's okay, baby.

745
01:24:06.017 --> 01:24:07.398
Oh my God.

746
01:25:09.667 --> 01:25:11.634
Get inside, get inside.

747
01:25:32.069 --> 01:25:33.725
Hey, go around back.
You all come with me.


748
01:26:04.239 --> 01:26:05.550
Go check the back.

749
01:27:13.825 --> 01:27:15.413
No, don't see anything.

750
01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:21.902
Guys?

751
01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:33.155
<i>Brad?</i>

752
01:27:33.190 --> 01:27:34.605
<i>Brad?</i>

753
01:27:57.455 --> 01:27:58.939
<i>Guys, do you copy?</i>

754
01:29:30.445 --> 01:29:32.585
Go out the front.
Go out the front.


755
01:30:16.491 --> 01:30:17.768
Ah!

756
01:30:20.702 --> 01:30:22.359
Fuck!

757
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:52.630
Are you okay?

758
01:31:05.609 --> 01:31:07.507
Patch me into the
emergency alert system.


759
01:31:07.542 --> 01:31:08.819
Oh no, no. Don't shoot, okay.

760
01:31:08.853 --> 01:31:10.545
- Fucking do it.
- Are you Tom?


761
01:31:10.579 --> 01:31:12.132
Right now!

762
01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:13.686
Oh, okay.

763
01:31:16.999 --> 01:31:17.966
Okay, go ahead.

764
01:31:19.139 --> 01:31:21.003
Get the fuck out.

765
01:32:05.565 --> 01:32:07.498
For generations,

766
01:32:07.533 --> 01:32:08.948
they have used fear

767
01:32:10.639 --> 01:32:11.709
and power

768
01:32:12.986 --> 01:32:14.540
to control us.

769
01:32:15.989 --> 01:32:17.612
Fear of prosecution.

770
01:32:18.854 --> 01:32:20.166
Fear of violence.

771
01:32:21.581 --> 01:32:22.858
Fear of death.

772
01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:25.758
Fear of each other.

773
01:32:27.518 --> 01:32:29.865
But fear will not cripple us.

774
01:32:32.489 --> 01:32:33.835
To those of you listening

775
01:32:33.869 --> 01:32:36.458
who wish to take our lives
from us.


776
01:32:39.979 --> 01:32:42.119
Who wish to silence us.

777
01:32:45.881 --> 01:32:47.469
Separate us.

778
01:32:54.131 --> 01:32:55.684
Know this.

779
01:32:59.723 --> 01:33:01.552
We are many.

780
01:33:07.316 --> 01:33:09.146
And we are strong.
