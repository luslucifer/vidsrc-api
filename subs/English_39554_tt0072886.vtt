1
00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:48.917
This is...

2
00:02:09.082 --> 00:02:11.542
This is Doc's
Fortress of Solitude


3
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:12.961
in the arctic circle,

4
00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.587
where he retreats every so often

5
00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:17.006
from the grueling
pressure of routine


6
00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:21.803
to concentrate and further
develop his wide knowledge.


7
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:24.305
To study astronomy...

8
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.141
The planets...

9
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:29.602
The stars...

10
00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:32.647
The universe.

11
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.945
Or work to invent something

12
00:02:39.153 --> 00:02:40.446
that one day

13
00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:42.824
might be useful to mankind.

14
00:02:53.668 --> 00:02:55.044
When Doc is in action,

15
00:02:55.253 --> 00:02:57.755
his brain trust,
the fabulous five,


16
00:02:57.964 --> 00:02:59.299
are never far behind.

17
00:02:59.507 --> 00:03:01.342
One of these
intrepid men is Ham,


18
00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:02.969
a legal genius,

19
00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:05.930
graduate magna
cum laude of Harvard.


20
00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.182
Not only justice for the rich,

21
00:03:08.391 --> 00:03:09.851
but justice for the poor.

22
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.103
Another member
of the group is Monk,


23
00:03:12.312 --> 00:03:13.938
the world's greatest chemist,

24
00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:15.898
winner of the Blanding prize,

25
00:03:16.107 --> 00:03:18.818
discoverer of the
fraxoning formula.


26
00:03:19.027 --> 00:03:21.612
He named his pet Habeas Corpus.

27
00:03:25.992 --> 00:03:27.702
The third member is Renny,

28
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.370
globe-hopping engineer--

29
00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.666
builder of great bridges,
dams, and skyscrapers.


30
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.126
Next is Johnny,

31
00:03:35.335 --> 00:03:37.670
erudite geologist
and archeologist.


32
00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.964
Famed for deciphering
the hieroglyphics


33
00:03:40.173 --> 00:03:41.549
of the teutonic stone,

34
00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:43.384
as well as for his
monumental studies


35
00:03:43.593 --> 00:03:46.888
of prehistoric man
in central Africa.


36
00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:49.807
Completing the
quintet is Long Tom,


37
00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:51.559
an electrical wizard.

38
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.146
Hi, Doc.

39
00:06:06.235 --> 00:06:08.654
Something's wrong.

40
00:06:08.863 --> 00:06:10.865
What is it?

41
00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:11.925
But how did you know?

42
00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.868
I sensed it.

43
00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:15.076
I picked up your thought waves,

44
00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:17.872
came as fast as I could.

45
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.417
Doc, it's in regard
to your father.


46
00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:26.923
Last week he passed
away down in South America


47
00:06:27.131 --> 00:06:30.635
in a little place
called Hidalgo.


48
00:06:30.843 --> 00:06:35.139
Apparently, he contracted
some rare tropical disease.


49
00:06:36.807 --> 00:06:39.435
We're sorry, Doc.

50
00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:43.189
We all know how close
you and your father were.


51
00:07:04.544 --> 00:07:07.755
This morning a large
Manila envelope arrived.


52
00:07:07.964 --> 00:07:09.257
It was from your father.

53
00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:10.883
As far as we could determine,

54
00:07:11.092 --> 00:07:13.636
he mailed it on the
very day he died.


55
00:07:13.844 --> 00:07:14.780
Where is it?

56
00:07:14.804 --> 00:07:16.097
He wrote on the envelope

57
00:07:16.305 --> 00:07:19.100
that its contents were
for your eyes alone,


58
00:07:19.308 --> 00:07:21.269
so I locked it in your safe.

59
00:07:59.098 --> 00:08:01.309
Shut up. You want
to get yourself killed?


60
00:08:42.433 --> 00:08:45.061
750 grains.

61
00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:48.147
577 caliber, nitro express.

62
00:08:48.356 --> 00:08:49.523
An elephant rifle.

63
00:08:49.732 --> 00:08:51.067
Right.

64
00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:00.326
I don't see a thing.

65
00:09:00.534 --> 00:09:03.037
An absolute absence
of ambulation.


66
00:09:37.655 --> 00:09:40.825
Registering heat
from a gun barrel...


67
00:09:41.033 --> 00:09:42.033
From the top of that building

68
00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:43.452
right over there.

69
00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:45.788
That's the old Eastman
Cranmoor building.


70
00:09:45.996 --> 00:09:47.623
Renny, we'll take the whizzer.

71
00:09:47.832 --> 00:09:48.809
Go get it warmed up.

72
00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:49.833
Check.

73
00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:50.959
Monk...

74
00:09:51.127 --> 00:09:52.753
You and the rest take the Cord,

75
00:09:52.962 --> 00:09:56.090
get over there as
fast as you can.


76
00:09:58.592 --> 00:09:59.592
To the garage.

77
00:09:59.635 --> 00:10:00.636
To the garage!

78
00:10:11.355 --> 00:10:12.648
It's a good thing

79
00:10:12.857 --> 00:10:14.859
Doc had those refractive
glass windows installed.


80
00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:16.067
Saved his life.

81
00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:17.403
Indubitably.

82
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:19.113
From the outside
everything appears to be


83
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:21.323
5 inches to the left
of where it actually is.


84
00:10:21.532 --> 00:10:23.743
A most fragmistatic invention.

85
00:11:05.117 --> 00:11:08.120
That tower, Renny.

86
00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:33.706
Up there!

87
00:12:41.714 --> 00:12:43.716
Watch what you're doing, stupid!

88
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.263
Watch out, Doc.

89
00:12:57.521 --> 00:12:59.273
The back door, let's
try the back door.


90
00:13:14.288 --> 00:13:15.873
Invidiously obstructed.

91
00:13:16.081 --> 00:13:18.292
This one's locked, too.

92
00:13:19.251 --> 00:13:20.836
Here, hold him for me.

93
00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:22.296
How many times
do I have to tell you?


94
00:13:22.504 --> 00:13:24.632
Get that revolting
beast away from me.


95
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.426
Look here, you 5th
Avenue fashion plate--


96
00:13:27.635 --> 00:13:28.635
I'll take him.

97
00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:30.054
OK.

98
00:13:30.262 --> 00:13:33.265
Out of my way, shyster.

99
00:14:14.014 --> 00:14:16.141
It doesn't work.
There's no juice!


100
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.644
The stairs, let's
take the stairs!


101
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.188
Hey, hey, wait a minute, fellas.

102
00:14:21.397 --> 00:14:23.440
Hey, fellas, I can
fix this in a minute.


103
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.817
Hey, hey, fellas!

104
00:15:07.026 --> 00:15:08.736
Hey, I got the elevator working.

105
00:15:08.944 --> 00:15:09.944
Come on.

106
00:15:36.847 --> 00:15:42.102
Aah!

107
00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:00.369
Look!

108
00:16:17.054 --> 00:16:18.180
One thing for sure--

109
00:16:18.388 --> 00:16:19.681
he ain't no native New Yorker.

110
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.141
The word is isn't.

111
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.976
Isn't, ain't, what's
the difference?


112
00:16:23.185 --> 00:16:25.145
Fingers look like they've
been dipped in blood.


113
00:16:25.354 --> 00:16:28.065
Somebody help me turn him over.

114
00:16:35.989 --> 00:16:39.618
Well, I'll be superamalgamated.

115
00:16:39.827 --> 00:16:42.496
I thought I knew the markings
of every tribe on earth,


116
00:16:42.704 --> 00:16:45.124
but I've never seen
anything like this before.


117
00:16:45.332 --> 00:16:46.583
What do you make of it, Doc?

118
00:16:49.378 --> 00:16:50.963
There's someone
in the penthouse.


119
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:52.673
Johnny, you stay with the body.

120
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:53.881
Come on.

121
00:16:58.095 --> 00:17:00.222
Johnny, you going
to be all right?


122
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.682
Ah...

123
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.016
Go.

124
00:17:12.985 --> 00:17:15.487
Do a Barney Oldfield, Long Tom.

125
00:17:40.387 --> 00:17:42.431
Long Tom, get the lights.

126
00:17:44.975 --> 00:17:46.226
Stand by, Monk.

127
00:17:48.228 --> 00:17:50.439
We'll use the
extinguisher globes.


128
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.495
What is it, Doc?

129
00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:31.271
We know that sound by now.

130
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.398
It means you figured
out something.


131
00:18:33.607 --> 00:18:37.736
My father did not die
of a tropical disease.


132
00:18:39.154 --> 00:18:40.154
He was murdered.

133
00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:53.126
What happened to you?

134
00:18:53.335 --> 00:18:55.462
I'm... quite copacetic.

135
00:18:55.671 --> 00:18:56.671
Doc?

136
00:18:57.839 --> 00:18:58.924
Holy cow, what happened here?

137
00:18:59.132 --> 00:19:00.467
Oh, nothing.

138
00:19:00.676 --> 00:19:02.928
Just some vipers snuck
in, blew up the safe,


139
00:19:03.136 --> 00:19:04.304
and burnt the papers.

140
00:19:04.513 --> 00:19:06.014
Yikes.

141
00:19:08.308 --> 00:19:09.309
Thank you.

142
00:19:09.518 --> 00:19:10.644
I...

143
00:19:10.852 --> 00:19:14.439
I was examining the strange
markings on the dead man...


144
00:19:14.648 --> 00:19:17.442
When a wall of
bricks fell on me.


145
00:19:17.651 --> 00:19:18.986
At least, that's
what it felt like.


146
00:19:19.194 --> 00:19:22.698
When I woke up...

147
00:19:22.906 --> 00:19:24.992
The body was gone.

148
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.786
But I did find one thing.

149
00:19:34.084 --> 00:19:35.627
Solid gold.

150
00:19:35.836 --> 00:19:39.131
Think it has something to
do with your father's death?


151
00:19:39.339 --> 00:19:41.800
I intend to find out.

152
00:19:46.013 --> 00:19:48.140
I'm leaving for
Hidalgo in the morning.


153
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.029
If you're going, 
I'm going, too.

154
00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:03.655
So am I. Me, too.

155
00:20:03.864 --> 00:20:05.907
That's why we all
came in the first place--


156
00:20:06.116 --> 00:20:07.576
in case you needed us.

157
00:20:07.784 --> 00:20:08.910
I wish I could join you.

158
00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:10.871
My company just
started a new turnpike.


159
00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.664
I'm in the middle of a trial.

160
00:20:12.873 --> 00:20:15.083
That's just what I expect from
you, you pompous peacock.


161
00:20:15.292 --> 00:20:16.793
Now, hold on, Monk.

162
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.964
None of you are
obligated to go with me.


163
00:20:21.173 --> 00:20:22.674
This is my problem.

164
00:20:22.883 --> 00:20:25.177
But, Doc, remember
when we were all buddies


165
00:20:25.385 --> 00:20:26.636
fighting in the trenches?

166
00:20:26.845 --> 00:20:27.845
Remember what we agreed?

167
00:20:28.013 --> 00:20:29.806
I, for one, recall it perfectly.

168
00:20:30.015 --> 00:20:32.017
If we ever got out alive,

169
00:20:32.225 --> 00:20:36.730
we'd help each other in
peace as we did in war.


170
00:20:38.357 --> 00:20:42.027
Look, I appreciate your
support, believe me,


171
00:20:42.235 --> 00:20:44.654
but now each of
you has a career.


172
00:20:44.863 --> 00:20:47.866
You've all risen to World-Wide
eminence in your chosen fields.


173
00:20:48.075 --> 00:20:49.701
I can't expect you to put aside

174
00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.286
what you worked so
hard for all these years.


175
00:20:51.495 --> 00:20:53.038
That's precisely the point.

176
00:20:53.246 --> 00:20:55.499
Here's an
indefectable opportunity


177
00:20:55.707 --> 00:20:57.959
to use our skills for
something more important


178
00:20:58.168 --> 00:21:00.212
than just our own selfish gain.

179
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.839
Yeah. Count us in.

180
00:21:04.049 --> 00:21:05.926
Thank you, Monk.

181
00:21:06.134 --> 00:21:07.469
Well...

182
00:21:07.677 --> 00:21:10.389
I'll see you in the
morning, chief.


183
00:21:10.597 --> 00:21:11.723
All right, Johnny.

184
00:21:13.767 --> 00:21:15.852
Oh, Johnny...

185
00:21:16.061 --> 00:21:17.061
You sure you're all right?

186
00:21:17.187 --> 00:21:19.981
Oh... supercradofolous...

187
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.652
Except for this goose egg
on the top of my noggin.


188
00:21:25.946 --> 00:21:27.447
I'll bring Johnny with me.

189
00:21:27.656 --> 00:21:28.656
OK, Long Tom.

190
00:21:28.782 --> 00:21:29.991
Right.

191
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.953
I wish I could go with you, Doc.

192
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:34.138
Good luck.

193
00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:35.162
Thank you.

194
00:21:36.123 --> 00:21:37.666
Yes. Good luck to you all.

195
00:21:37.874 --> 00:21:41.128
Anyway, you won't need a
lawyer down there, will you?


196
00:21:41.336 --> 00:21:43.588
No, I wouldn't think so, Ham.

197
00:21:45.674 --> 00:21:47.134
Uh, we'll, uh...

198
00:21:47.342 --> 00:21:48.844
We'll look after the store.

199
00:21:49.052 --> 00:21:51.096
Thanks.

200
00:22:22.377 --> 00:22:25.505
A glorious good
morning, gentlemen.


201
00:22:25.714 --> 00:22:26.714
Hi, guys.

202
00:22:26.882 --> 00:22:27.882
Sure gave me a scare.

203
00:22:28.008 --> 00:22:29.342
Almost dropped this box.

204
00:22:29.551 --> 00:22:31.803
Well, I didn't expect
you, but welcome.


205
00:22:32.012 --> 00:22:34.681
Thinking it over, I
came to the conclusion


206
00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.516
you might need
a lawyer after all.


207
00:22:36.725 --> 00:22:37.851
And an engineer, too.

208
00:22:38.059 --> 00:22:40.061
What about that
trial of yours, Ham?


209
00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.813
Oh, the heck with the trial.

210
00:22:42.022 --> 00:22:43.940
I'll let my partner
worry about it.


211
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:47.861
To heck with the
turnpike, too, okay?


212
00:22:48.069 --> 00:22:49.069
Okay.

213
00:22:49.154 --> 00:22:50.131
Let's go.

214
00:22:50.155 --> 00:22:52.115
After you, gentlemen.

215
00:22:53.074 --> 00:22:54.451
Let me take that.

216
00:24:28.712 --> 00:24:29.796
It worked, Doc!

217
00:24:30.005 --> 00:24:31.089
It worked!

218
00:24:37.304 --> 00:24:38.638
Well, that's that.

219
00:24:38.847 --> 00:24:40.181
Sure was an expensive way

220
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.933
to throw those
mugs off our tail.


221
00:24:42.142 --> 00:24:43.184
Oh, not really, Monk.

222
00:24:43.393 --> 00:24:44.519
Actually, that robot airplane

223
00:24:44.728 --> 00:24:47.105
was only made of
fabric and plywood.


224
00:24:47.314 --> 00:24:49.399
The dummies...

225
00:24:49.608 --> 00:24:51.443
Simply dummies.

226
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:55.614
Besides, we've wanted to test this
remote control system for some time,


227
00:24:55.822 --> 00:24:56.822
right, Tom?

228
00:24:56.865 --> 00:24:58.533
And we sure did.

229
00:24:58.742 --> 00:24:59.784
Well, gentlemen,

230
00:24:59.993 --> 00:25:01.494
let's be on our way.

231
00:25:01.703 --> 00:25:05.665
Yeah. I want to see what
that Hidalgo place looks like.


232
00:25:10.837 --> 00:25:12.172
Before we go...

233
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.550
Let us remember our code--

234
00:25:15.759 --> 00:25:18.678
let us strive every
moment of our lives


235
00:25:18.887 --> 00:25:22.932
to make ourselves better and
better to the best of our ability


236
00:25:23.141 --> 00:25:25.935
so that all may profit by it.

237
00:25:26.144 --> 00:25:28.021
Let us think of the right

238
00:25:28.229 --> 00:25:31.900
and lend our assistance
to all who may need it,


239
00:25:32.108 --> 00:25:34.819
with no regard for
anything but justice.


240
00:25:35.028 --> 00:25:38.531
Let us take what
comes with a smile


241
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.784
without loss of courage.

242
00:25:40.992 --> 00:25:44.537
Let us be considerate
of our country,


243
00:25:44.746 --> 00:25:47.248
our fellow citizens,

244
00:25:47.457 --> 00:25:51.878
and our associates in
everything we say and do.


245
00:25:52.087 --> 00:25:55.507
Let us do right to all...

246
00:25:55.715 --> 00:25:57.217
And wrong no man.

247
00:26:51.062 --> 00:26:52.689
Good evening.

248
00:26:58.319 --> 00:27:00.697
Ah, to your health,
Captain Seas.


249
00:27:00.905 --> 00:27:01.905
Everything worked out

250
00:27:02.073 --> 00:27:03.241
just the way you planned it.

251
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.785
I wish I could
believe you, Borden.


252
00:27:05.994 --> 00:27:07.579
I didn't think Doc Savage

253
00:27:07.787 --> 00:27:09.497
would be that easy to eliminate.

254
00:27:09.706 --> 00:27:12.041
I tell you he's dead,
and his gang are dead.


255
00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.754
I blasted them out of
the sky into a million bits.


256
00:27:15.962 --> 00:27:18.757
You saw no
parachutes, no survivors?


257
00:27:18.965 --> 00:27:20.133
Aye. Not a one.

258
00:27:20.341 --> 00:27:22.302
Believe me, the
papers are burned,


259
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.929
and Savage and his
crummy five are finished.


260
00:27:25.138 --> 00:27:28.641
And, uh, Molo's body?

261
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:29.934
Ah, me and Cheelok,

262
00:27:30.143 --> 00:27:31.811
we snatched him
from where he fell


263
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.480
and dumped him
into the East River.


264
00:27:33.688 --> 00:27:34.688
Oh,

265
00:27:34.856 --> 00:27:36.983
have a drink, captain.

266
00:27:37.192 --> 00:27:40.820
To poor, departed souls.

267
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:43.907
May they rest in pieces.

268
00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:45.950
Heh. Ha ha ha ha...

269
00:27:46.159 --> 00:27:47.494
He is telling the truth?

270
00:27:47.702 --> 00:27:49.621
Absolutely.

271
00:27:49.829 --> 00:27:54.125
And perhaps now we will
share a bit of the wealth,


272
00:27:54.334 --> 00:27:55.960
won't we, sir?

273
00:27:56.169 --> 00:27:57.837
You bet your life, Kulkan.

274
00:27:58.046 --> 00:27:59.172
Both of you.

275
00:28:08.932 --> 00:28:10.517
You like money, eh?

276
00:28:10.725 --> 00:28:12.644
Oh, sure, poopsie.

277
00:28:12.852 --> 00:28:14.270
Well, you listen to me.

278
00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:16.564
I started out in a sideshow,

279
00:28:16.773 --> 00:28:19.984
got into the swing of
things, and made millions,


280
00:28:20.193 --> 00:28:21.694
but it's nothing,

281
00:28:21.903 --> 00:28:24.072
nothing compared
to what's ahead.


282
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.032
Oh, ha ha ha...

283
00:29:14.205 --> 00:29:16.541
Yes, I knew your father,

284
00:29:16.749 --> 00:29:17.917
Professor Savage, senior,

285
00:29:18.126 --> 00:29:19.126
very well.

286
00:29:19.294 --> 00:29:21.212
He was a good man.

287
00:29:22.255 --> 00:29:24.299
We were very close friends,

288
00:29:24.507 --> 00:29:25.925
and his death

289
00:29:26.134 --> 00:29:27.385
was a personal tragedy for me.

290
00:29:29.095 --> 00:29:32.098
I'm told he died of a
rare tropical disease.


291
00:29:32.307 --> 00:29:34.017
Yeah. The professor
contracted it


292
00:29:34.225 --> 00:29:35.685
during his last trip

293
00:29:35.894 --> 00:29:37.854
into the jungles
of the interior.


294
00:29:38.062 --> 00:29:40.440
By the time he
returned to Hidalgo,


295
00:29:40.648 --> 00:29:42.859
red and green blotches

296
00:29:43.067 --> 00:29:45.278
had broken out on his skin.

297
00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:47.322
Do you know of anyone

298
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.783
who might have had reason to...

299
00:29:50.992 --> 00:29:52.619
Murder my father?

300
00:29:52.827 --> 00:29:54.120
On the contrary,

301
00:29:54.329 --> 00:29:56.247
the professor was
loved and respected


302
00:29:56.456 --> 00:29:57.957
by the people of Hidalgo.

303
00:29:58.166 --> 00:29:59.834
He set up a hospital

304
00:30:00.043 --> 00:30:01.461
here in the capital city,

305
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:03.755
established schools

306
00:30:03.963 --> 00:30:05.131
in rural villages,

307
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.134
and even taught
first aid and sanitation


308
00:30:08.343 --> 00:30:10.261
to remote tribes.

309
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.804
In fact,

310
00:30:12.013 --> 00:30:14.682
one of the tribes,
out of gratitude,


311
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:16.517
gave him several kilometers

312
00:30:16.726 --> 00:30:18.353
of their hereditary land.

313
00:30:18.561 --> 00:30:20.271
Undoubtedly,

314
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.566
the land is mosquito and
snake infested jungle--


315
00:30:23.775 --> 00:30:24.817
worthless.

316
00:30:25.026 --> 00:30:27.737
But it was a sincere gesture.

317
00:30:27.946 --> 00:30:29.906
May I ask a question, Doc,

318
00:30:30.114 --> 00:30:31.407
if you don't mind?

319
00:30:31.616 --> 00:30:33.326
Why, of course, Ham. Go ahead.

320
00:30:33.534 --> 00:30:35.119
Thanks.

321
00:30:36.871 --> 00:30:38.247
Mr. President...

322
00:30:39.332 --> 00:30:41.876
Was the grant to
Professor Savage


323
00:30:42.085 --> 00:30:43.670
officially recorded?

324
00:30:43.878 --> 00:30:44.963
The transfer was registered

325
00:30:45.171 --> 00:30:47.423
with the land recorder's office.

326
00:30:47.632 --> 00:30:49.759
I remember directing him there.

327
00:30:49.968 --> 00:30:52.428
May we, then, see the deed?

328
00:30:52.637 --> 00:30:53.238
Of course.

329
00:30:53.262 --> 00:30:54.639
Colonel Ramirez,

330
00:30:54.847 --> 00:30:58.434
see that the deed is
brought over here at once.


331
00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:22.583
Señorita Flores.

332
00:31:49.986 --> 00:31:54.240
This is the way my secretary
found it, Señor Presidente--


333
00:31:54.449 --> 00:31:55.700
empty.

334
00:31:57.035 --> 00:31:58.661
The documents are gone.

335
00:32:00.496 --> 00:32:02.123
Perhaps it will show up.

336
00:32:02.331 --> 00:32:04.584
No, it will not.

337
00:32:06.544 --> 00:32:08.838
I'm not surprised
the deed is missing.


338
00:32:12.008 --> 00:32:14.052
In fact, I rather expected it.

339
00:32:15.303 --> 00:32:16.596
But we will not turn around

340
00:32:16.804 --> 00:32:19.223
and fly back to New York.

341
00:32:19.432 --> 00:32:21.642
We are going to visit that tribe

342
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:25.063
who so graciously gave
that land to my father.


343
00:32:26.314 --> 00:32:28.858
Now, if someone
will be kind enough


344
00:32:29.067 --> 00:32:30.860
to explain how we get there...

345
00:32:31.069 --> 00:32:32.278
Oh, well, uh...

346
00:32:32.487 --> 00:32:33.821
Well, unfortunately, señor,

347
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.449
we do not know the
name of the tribe.


348
00:32:36.657 --> 00:32:38.868
Uh, it could be any
one of hundreds of tribes


349
00:32:39.077 --> 00:32:41.037
isolated in the jungle.

350
00:32:41.245 --> 00:32:42.997
Of course...

351
00:32:43.206 --> 00:32:45.666
I could try to locate a guide.

352
00:32:45.875 --> 00:32:49.170
Uh, maybe a native who
traveled with your father.


353
00:32:49.378 --> 00:32:51.923
I think Don Rubio
has a good idea.


354
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:53.466
Let him find a guide.

355
00:32:55.176 --> 00:32:56.176
It, uh,

356
00:32:56.219 --> 00:32:57.929
it may take a few days.

357
00:32:58.137 --> 00:32:59.180
We'll wait.

358
00:33:00.807 --> 00:33:01.807
Ah.

359
00:33:01.974 --> 00:33:03.810
In that case, I invite you all

360
00:33:04.018 --> 00:33:05.812
to stay at the
government's residence


361
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.314
as our most honored guests.

362
00:33:08.523 --> 00:33:09.333
Thank you.

363
00:33:09.357 --> 00:33:11.192
We appreciate your generosity.

364
00:33:12.193 --> 00:33:14.153
This way, please.

365
00:33:26.833 --> 00:33:28.709
Oh, there's just one more thing.

366
00:33:30.336 --> 00:33:32.130
May I respectfully request

367
00:33:32.338 --> 00:33:34.590
an autopsy be performed
upon my father?


368
00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:36.676
Of course. If you wish.

369
00:33:38.386 --> 00:33:39.971
Gracias, Señor Presidente.

370
00:33:40.179 --> 00:33:42.098
No hay de qué, Caballero.

371
00:33:46.227 --> 00:33:48.187
Yes, I am positive.

372
00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:50.857
Doc Savage and
his men are alive.


373
00:33:51.065 --> 00:33:53.192
I was with them
less than an hour ago


374
00:33:53.401 --> 00:33:54.861
in the office of El Presidente.

375
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.697
No, I am not dreaming!

376
00:33:57.905 --> 00:34:00.867
Their photograph will be
in the newspaper tomorrow.


377
00:34:02.076 --> 00:34:03.327
Yes, but fortunat--

378
00:34:03.536 --> 00:34:04.829
yes, but for--

379
00:34:05.037 --> 00:34:07.582
fortunately, I think quickly!

380
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.125
Will you listen to me?

381
00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:11.794
They are not leaving
Hidalgo for a few days,


382
00:34:12.003 --> 00:34:13.337
understand?

383
00:34:15.047 --> 00:34:16.047
Yes, sir.

384
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.801
Yes, sir. Yeah.

385
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.845
I guarantee it.

386
00:34:21.053 --> 00:34:22.346
Yes, sir.

387
00:34:22.555 --> 00:34:24.348
Yes, sir.

388
00:34:24.557 --> 00:34:25.933
Yes, sir.

389
00:34:26.142 --> 00:34:27.351
Yes, sir.

390
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.188
Yes, sir.

391
00:34:36.986 --> 00:34:38.863
Ah!

392
00:34:39.071 --> 00:34:40.698
What's the matter, honey?

393
00:34:40.907 --> 00:34:42.158
That...

394
00:34:42.366 --> 00:34:46.245
That no-good pilot Borden.

395
00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:03.970
Ahh.

396
00:35:22.865 --> 00:35:23.865
Ahh.

397
00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:31.582
Eh...

398
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:33.709
Aah!

399
00:35:33.918 --> 00:35:35.503
Ouch!

400
00:35:41.676 --> 00:35:42.843
Ah!

401
00:35:50.059 --> 00:35:51.394
Aah!

402
00:36:11.664 --> 00:36:13.207
Ooh!

403
00:36:22.133 --> 00:36:24.051
Come on! Come--

404
00:36:29.849 --> 00:36:30.849
No!

405
00:36:32.018 --> 00:36:34.145
Oh. Oh!

406
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:36.730
Aah!

407
00:36:43.612 --> 00:36:44.697
Ow!

408
00:36:44.905 --> 00:36:46.157
Ooh!

409
00:36:48.034 --> 00:36:49.034
Oh.

410
00:36:49.994 --> 00:36:51.287
Ohh.

411
00:36:51.495 --> 00:36:52.495
Ohhh.

412
00:37:13.142 --> 00:37:14.643
Ay, que guapo

413
00:37:14.852 --> 00:37:15.829
¿te Mira?

414
00:37:15.853 --> 00:37:16.853
Sí, bien.

415
00:37:18.939 --> 00:37:19.939
Oye, que estan mi--

416
00:37:20.024 --> 00:37:21.484
oye!

417
00:37:37.583 --> 00:37:40.795
Aye-yiii....

418
00:37:41.003 --> 00:37:42.004
Que chulo.

419
00:37:52.306 --> 00:37:55.351
Old Doc gets the
girls every time.


420
00:37:55.559 --> 00:37:56.328
Yeah.

421
00:37:56.352 --> 00:37:57.853
That is one good reason

422
00:37:58.062 --> 00:38:00.147
not to neglect daily
exercise, my friends.


423
00:38:00.356 --> 00:38:01.690
Singularly remarkable.

424
00:38:01.899 --> 00:38:02.899
No matter where he is,

425
00:38:02.983 --> 00:38:03.983
no matter what he's doing,

426
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.487
two hours of exercise every day.

427
00:38:06.695 --> 00:38:08.447
Now, if you'd follow
Doc's good example,


428
00:38:08.656 --> 00:38:10.783
you might lose
some of that ugly fat


429
00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:12.243
and start to resemble
a human being


430
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:14.745
instead of a clumsy baboon.

431
00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:21.961
Stop where you are, you swine,

432
00:38:22.169 --> 00:38:23.796
or you'll be crisp bacon

433
00:38:24.004 --> 00:38:25.631
for breakfast tomorrow morning.

434
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.800
You touch one
hair on that piglet,


435
00:38:28.008 --> 00:38:29.635
and I'll crisp your bacon!

436
00:38:29.844 --> 00:38:30.844
Hold him!

437
00:38:33.973 --> 00:38:35.141
Monk. Huh?

438
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:37.143
You know Ham
wouldn't hurt a fly.


439
00:38:37.351 --> 00:38:39.645
His sword will only put
you to sleep for awhile.


440
00:38:42.857 --> 00:38:43.857
Come on.

441
00:39:25.983 --> 00:39:26.983
May I?

442
00:39:27.026 --> 00:39:28.152
Oh.

443
00:39:29.487 --> 00:39:30.654
Thank you.

444
00:39:30.863 --> 00:39:32.823
Juan Lopez Morales is my name.

445
00:39:33.032 --> 00:39:34.783
I am the coroner of Hidalgo.

446
00:39:34.992 --> 00:39:36.035
Oh, I see.

447
00:39:36.243 --> 00:39:37.828
Let me get a towel.

448
00:39:43.501 --> 00:39:44.710
Well?

449
00:39:44.919 --> 00:39:46.378
Hey, fellas, look.

450
00:39:48.297 --> 00:39:50.341
Could be trouble.

451
00:39:56.889 --> 00:39:58.057
And the autopsy disclosed

452
00:39:58.265 --> 00:40:00.392
a residue of some
strange substance.


453
00:40:02.978 --> 00:40:04.688
Ah, Mr. Mayfair.

454
00:40:04.897 --> 00:40:07.066
I recognize you from the
picture in time magazine.


455
00:40:07.274 --> 00:40:08.776
Very happy to meet you--

456
00:40:08.984 --> 00:40:10.236
such a famous authority

457
00:40:10.444 --> 00:40:12.696
in the field of
analytic chemistry.


458
00:40:12.905 --> 00:40:13.905
Everything all right?

459
00:40:14.073 --> 00:40:15.533
Certainly.

460
00:40:15.741 --> 00:40:17.117
Señor Morales here

461
00:40:17.326 --> 00:40:19.828
is the coroner of Hidalgo.

462
00:40:20.037 --> 00:40:21.205
Oh.

463
00:40:22.331 --> 00:40:23.999
So, you liked my picture, huh?

464
00:40:24.208 --> 00:40:25.834
He didn't say he liked it.

465
00:40:26.043 --> 00:40:27.836
He said he saw it.

466
00:40:28.045 --> 00:40:29.964
Señor Morales was just giving me

467
00:40:30.172 --> 00:40:31.590
the report on the autopsy.

468
00:40:31.799 --> 00:40:34.176
Yes, I was saying
that in the skin tissue


469
00:40:34.385 --> 00:40:35.844
of Professor Savage's
hands and face


470
00:40:36.053 --> 00:40:38.639
a residue of some foreign
substance was detected.


471
00:40:38.847 --> 00:40:42.017
And I must confess, I have
not been able to identify it.


472
00:40:42.226 --> 00:40:43.644
Did you bring the slides?

473
00:40:43.852 --> 00:40:44.853
Indeed.

474
00:40:45.062 --> 00:40:46.397
I anticipated you and Mr. Savage

475
00:40:46.605 --> 00:40:48.899
might want to study
them yourselves.


476
00:40:49.108 --> 00:40:51.110
Gustavo.

477
00:42:09.104 --> 00:42:10.439
Doc, what's going on?

478
00:42:10.648 --> 00:42:12.441
Don't come in here.
Stay where you are.


479
00:42:19.698 --> 00:42:21.617
Shh. Doc's inside.

480
00:42:28.707 --> 00:42:29.833
I thought I heard--

481
00:42:30.042 --> 00:42:31.085
shh. We all did.

482
00:42:55.651 --> 00:42:57.069
Hey, Doc.

483
00:42:57.277 --> 00:42:58.277
Doc.

484
00:43:00.406 --> 00:43:02.366
Everything OK, Doc?

485
00:43:03.283 --> 00:43:04.827
Hey, Doc!

486
00:43:05.035 --> 00:43:06.370
Is anything wrong, Doc?

487
00:43:08.831 --> 00:43:10.124
Doc! Doc?

488
00:43:10.332 --> 00:43:13.127
We'll come in, 
Doc, all right?

489
00:43:15.963 --> 00:43:16.940
Doc, is everything all right?

490
00:43:16.964 --> 00:43:17.732
Yeah.

491
00:43:17.756 --> 00:43:18.608
I heard a shot.

492
00:43:18.632 --> 00:43:20.426
What happened, Doc?

493
00:43:20.634 --> 00:43:23.137
I don't know.

494
00:43:23.345 --> 00:43:26.140
I really don't know.

495
00:43:56.503 --> 00:43:57.503
Hello.

496
00:44:00.799 --> 00:44:02.968
How do you do, Mr. Savage?

497
00:44:03.177 --> 00:44:04.070
Oh, I'm not Doc.

498
00:44:04.094 --> 00:44:05.721
My name's Monk.

499
00:44:05.929 --> 00:44:09.683
Uh, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew
Blodgett Mayfair at your service.


500
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:13.353
I'm one of Doc
Savage's assistants.


501
00:44:13.562 --> 00:44:15.939
Is there anything I can
do to help, miss, uh...


502
00:44:16.148 --> 00:44:17.191
Karen.

503
00:44:17.399 --> 00:44:19.777
I'm Karen and she's Adriana.

504
00:44:19.985 --> 00:44:21.320
Well, lovely ladies,

505
00:44:21.528 --> 00:44:22.780
what can I do to help you?

506
00:44:22.988 --> 00:44:25.157
We're friends of Captain Seas.

507
00:44:25.365 --> 00:44:27.242
He read in the newspapers

508
00:44:27.451 --> 00:44:29.161
about Mr. Savage and his friends

509
00:44:29.369 --> 00:44:30.746
staying in Hidalgo
for a few days.


510
00:44:30.954 --> 00:44:33.665
So, he asked us to personally
invite all of you to dinner


511
00:44:33.874 --> 00:44:35.125
on his yacht.

512
00:44:35.334 --> 00:44:36.376
Oh.

513
00:44:37.336 --> 00:44:38.837
That's very nice.

514
00:44:39.046 --> 00:44:40.756
But who's Captain Seas?

515
00:44:40.964 --> 00:44:42.925
He's a very rich man.

516
00:44:43.133 --> 00:44:45.761
He owns that big yacht
just outside the bay.


517
00:44:46.887 --> 00:44:49.014
Boy. Wait till you see it.

518
00:44:49.223 --> 00:44:52.351
The captain would
be extremely honored.


519
00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:55.896
He's most anxious to meet the famous
Doc Savage and his amazing men.


520
00:44:56.104 --> 00:44:57.397
Well, I'm sorry.

521
00:44:57.606 --> 00:44:58.649
I'm very sorry,

522
00:44:58.857 --> 00:45:02.110
but Doc ain't got no
free time at the moment.


523
00:45:02.319 --> 00:45:05.572
Why don't you come
back in a week or so, okay?


524
00:45:05.781 --> 00:45:08.534
Captain Seas will
be so disappointed.


525
00:45:08.742 --> 00:45:09.827
Ah, I'm sorry.

526
00:45:10.035 --> 00:45:12.287
Maybe then-- in a couple weeks.

527
00:45:13.288 --> 00:45:14.832
Please tell Captain Seas

528
00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.040
we'd be delighted.

529
00:45:16.083 --> 00:45:17.251
Ohh.

530
00:45:17.459 --> 00:45:18.836
I presume you lovely ladies

531
00:45:19.044 --> 00:45:20.546
will be present also.

532
00:45:20.754 --> 00:45:22.631
Oh, swell.

533
00:45:41.942 --> 00:45:42.942
Welcome, Savage.

534
00:45:43.068 --> 00:45:44.862
Proud to have you aboard.

535
00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:46.864
Good evening, Captain Seas.

536
00:45:47.072 --> 00:45:48.072
Good evening, ladies.

537
00:45:48.198 --> 00:45:49.867
Hello, Mr. Savage.

538
00:45:50.075 --> 00:45:51.159
Hello, Colonel Mayfair.

539
00:45:51.368 --> 00:45:54.079
So nice to see both of you.

540
00:45:55.706 --> 00:45:57.541
Oh. So many of you...

541
00:45:57.749 --> 00:45:59.167
And all so handsome.

542
00:45:59.376 --> 00:46:00.878
Hot sarsaparilla.

543
00:46:01.086 --> 00:46:02.087
Savage...

544
00:46:02.296 --> 00:46:03.755
This way, please.

545
00:46:03.964 --> 00:46:04.964
Thank you.

546
00:46:10.929 --> 00:46:13.307
I've heard a great
deal about you.


547
00:46:13.515 --> 00:46:14.492
Scientist,

548
00:46:14.516 --> 00:46:15.493
explorer,

549
00:46:15.517 --> 00:46:16.244
inventor,

550
00:46:16.268 --> 00:46:17.436
criminologist.

551
00:46:17.644 --> 00:46:20.105
Some people even
say you're a magician--


552
00:46:20.314 --> 00:46:22.107
at least when it comes

553
00:46:22.316 --> 00:46:24.318
to remarkable escapes.

554
00:46:24.526 --> 00:46:25.819
Holy cow.

555
00:46:26.028 --> 00:46:28.947
What a plum-dingy yacht this is.

556
00:46:29.156 --> 00:46:30.156
A necessity...

557
00:46:30.324 --> 00:46:31.408
Uh, not a luxury.

558
00:46:31.617 --> 00:46:32.826
Oh.

559
00:46:33.035 --> 00:46:34.119
Oh, please, make
yourself comfortable.


560
00:46:34.328 --> 00:46:35.621
Sit down, gentlemen.

561
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:36.829
Thank you.

562
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.127
It serves as my permanent home

563
00:46:42.336 --> 00:46:45.130
as well as my
business headquarters.


564
00:46:45.339 --> 00:46:47.633
Just what is your business,

565
00:46:47.841 --> 00:46:48.967
Captain Seas?

566
00:46:49.176 --> 00:46:51.678
It changes from day to day...

567
00:46:51.887 --> 00:46:52.971
But basically,

568
00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.474
what I do is
recognize opportunities


569
00:46:55.682 --> 00:46:57.935
and seize them.

570
00:46:58.143 --> 00:47:00.062
That why they call
you Captain Seas?


571
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:01.480
Ha ha ha ha.

572
00:47:01.688 --> 00:47:04.316
Very good. Very good.

573
00:47:04.524 --> 00:47:05.525
Ha ha ha ha.

574
00:47:05.734 --> 00:47:06.734
No.

575
00:47:07.945 --> 00:47:09.071
I've made so many voyages

576
00:47:09.279 --> 00:47:10.697
to all corners of the world,

577
00:47:10.906 --> 00:47:13.367
that I adopted the name seas.

578
00:47:13.575 --> 00:47:14.552
S...

579
00:47:14.576 --> 00:47:15.553
E...

580
00:47:15.577 --> 00:47:16.554
A...

581
00:47:16.578 --> 00:47:17.578
S.

582
00:47:17.704 --> 00:47:18.872
My real name

583
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:20.666
is absolutely unpronounceable.

584
00:47:23.752 --> 00:47:25.337
Champagne?

585
00:47:25.545 --> 00:47:26.838
No, thank you.

586
00:47:27.047 --> 00:47:28.799
Perhaps something
a bit more potent--


587
00:47:29.007 --> 00:47:30.926
scotch, vodka, bourbon?

588
00:47:31.134 --> 00:47:32.803
I'll have a coke, please.

589
00:47:33.011 --> 00:47:34.888
And, uh, you gentlemen?

590
00:47:35.097 --> 00:47:36.932
Same for me.

591
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.809
I think I'd prefer a lemonade.

592
00:47:39.017 --> 00:47:40.852
Yeah, me, too.

593
00:47:41.061 --> 00:47:42.521
Yeah, make mine a...

594
00:47:42.729 --> 00:47:43.730
Root beer.

595
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.652
Uh, if it's not too
exiguous a request...


596
00:47:50.153 --> 00:47:51.697
Could I have a glass of milk?

597
00:47:51.905 --> 00:47:53.240
Ew.

598
00:47:58.537 --> 00:47:59.788
Tell me, Savage,

599
00:47:59.997 --> 00:48:01.623
what brings you and your friends

600
00:48:01.832 --> 00:48:03.542
to the republic of Hidalgo?

601
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:06.753
Very few people even
know of its existence.


602
00:48:06.962 --> 00:48:09.256
My father passed
away in Hidalgo.


603
00:48:10.257 --> 00:48:12.843
We came to pay
our last respects.


604
00:48:13.051 --> 00:48:15.178
I'm truly sorry.

605
00:48:16.096 --> 00:48:17.889
My deepest sympathies.

606
00:48:19.516 --> 00:48:21.184
Chow!

607
00:48:21.393 --> 00:48:22.393
I mean...

608
00:48:22.561 --> 00:48:23.561
Dinner is served.

609
00:48:49.504 --> 00:48:50.756
What a meal.

610
00:48:50.964 --> 00:48:53.091
You mind if I loosen my belt?

611
00:48:54.301 --> 00:48:56.136
You'll have to
forgive my friend.


612
00:48:56.344 --> 00:48:59.056
As a child, he was so
busy studying chemistry,


613
00:48:59.264 --> 00:49:01.558
he never learned any manners.

614
00:49:01.767 --> 00:49:06.229
Please, please. I'm sure my
chef would take it as a compliment.


615
00:49:06.438 --> 00:49:07.438
Uh, cigar?

616
00:49:07.564 --> 00:49:09.024
No, thank you.

617
00:49:10.442 --> 00:49:11.443
Cigarette?

618
00:49:11.651 --> 00:49:12.694
Thank you, no.

619
00:49:12.903 --> 00:49:14.446
Oh, I should've guessed.

620
00:49:14.654 --> 00:49:18.033
You and your friends
don't smoke either.


621
00:49:18.241 --> 00:49:19.993
I'll have one, if I may.

622
00:49:20.202 --> 00:49:22.704
Why, yes, of course.

623
00:49:22.913 --> 00:49:24.581
Thank you.

624
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:25.916
Uh, light?

625
00:49:26.124 --> 00:49:28.126
Oh, no thanks. I...

626
00:49:28.335 --> 00:49:29.795
I have one of my own.

627
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.882
Uh, Karen...

628
00:49:34.091 --> 00:49:35.425
Adriana.

629
00:49:36.635 --> 00:49:39.346
If you'll excuse us, gentlemen.

630
00:49:41.973 --> 00:49:44.309
So nice to have made
your acquaintance.


631
00:49:44.518 --> 00:49:45.811
Oh. You men--

632
00:49:46.019 --> 00:49:47.813
always talking business.

633
00:49:55.487 --> 00:49:56.655
Toodle-oo.

634
00:49:56.863 --> 00:49:57.948
Toodle-oo.

635
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:05.497
To tell the truth...

636
00:50:05.705 --> 00:50:08.667
I didn't think we'd ever meet.

637
00:50:08.875 --> 00:50:10.669
I rather assumed we would.

638
00:50:10.877 --> 00:50:12.170
Ha ha ha.

639
00:50:12.379 --> 00:50:15.632
You are indeed a
most unusual man.


640
00:50:15.841 --> 00:50:17.300
You know...

641
00:50:17.509 --> 00:50:18.844
Under different circumstances,

642
00:50:19.052 --> 00:50:20.804
we possibly could've
become friends,


643
00:50:21.012 --> 00:50:22.806
since we're both adventurers--

644
00:50:23.014 --> 00:50:25.392
each in our own way.

645
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.687
But circumstances
are not different.


646
00:50:31.523 --> 00:50:32.524
Anyway,

647
00:50:32.732 --> 00:50:34.693
I'm glad you
enjoyed your dinner.


648
00:50:36.111 --> 00:50:38.780
Because it was your last.

649
00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:42.868
And you, sir.

650
00:50:43.076 --> 00:50:45.120
Enjoy your last cigarette.

651
00:51:26.077 --> 00:51:27.787
Ooh!

652
00:51:27.996 --> 00:51:28.996
Aah!

653
00:51:47.849 --> 00:51:48.892
Come on!

654
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.268
Come on!

655
00:52:38.984 --> 00:52:40.360
Let's get out.

656
00:52:44.781 --> 00:52:46.157
Aah!

657
00:52:49.577 --> 00:52:51.329
Come on. This way.

658
00:53:04.384 --> 00:53:05.802
Holy cow. Into the drink!

659
00:54:26.007 --> 00:54:27.550
Searchlights!

660
00:54:38.853 --> 00:54:40.105
Hold your fire!

661
00:54:49.072 --> 00:54:50.407
What happened to them?

662
00:54:53.284 --> 00:54:54.786
Move out the ship.

663
00:55:16.307 --> 00:55:17.934
I am sorry, Señor Savage,

664
00:55:18.143 --> 00:55:19.185
but there is no yacht

665
00:55:19.394 --> 00:55:21.688
such as the one
you have described.


666
00:55:21.896 --> 00:55:24.816
You, yourself, heard what
the harbor master said.


667
00:55:25.024 --> 00:55:27.318
My patrol boats, too,
searched the bay--


668
00:55:27.527 --> 00:55:28.820
the whole area--

669
00:55:29.028 --> 00:55:30.155
for hours...

670
00:55:30.363 --> 00:55:32.365
And found nothing.

671
00:55:33.324 --> 00:55:35.160
But we don't give up.

672
00:55:35.368 --> 00:55:37.829
Our men are still out there...

673
00:55:38.037 --> 00:55:39.330
Looking.

674
00:55:39.539 --> 00:55:40.832
To the residence.

675
00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.167
Can't we have lunch first

676
00:55:42.375 --> 00:55:44.169
in a nice little cantina?

677
00:55:44.377 --> 00:55:46.171
Do what you like, Monk.

678
00:55:46.379 --> 00:55:49.340
Take me to the land
recorder's office, if you will.


679
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:50.549
But señor...

680
00:55:51.551 --> 00:55:52.551
Yes, señor.

681
00:55:52.719 --> 00:55:53.845
Vamanos!

682
00:55:54.053 --> 00:55:55.030
No, no.

683
00:55:55.054 --> 00:55:56.031
If you behave like a pig,

684
00:55:56.055 --> 00:55:57.807
no lunch.

685
00:56:08.693 --> 00:56:09.861
May I help you?

686
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:11.362
Why, I believe so.

687
00:56:11.571 --> 00:56:13.323
My name is Clark Savage junior,

688
00:56:13.531 --> 00:56:14.341
and I was hoping--

689
00:56:14.365 --> 00:56:16.284
yes, I recognize you.

690
00:56:16.493 --> 00:56:18.661
You are the son of
Professor Savage.


691
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:19.954
That's right.

692
00:56:20.163 --> 00:56:21.539
I am sorry.

693
00:56:21.748 --> 00:56:23.333
He was a very fine man.

694
00:56:23.541 --> 00:56:24.584
Thank you.

695
00:56:26.211 --> 00:56:29.172
Um, is Señor Gorro in?

696
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.132
No, he is out for lunch,

697
00:56:31.341 --> 00:56:32.884
but he will be back soon

698
00:56:33.092 --> 00:56:35.386
if you would like to wait.

699
00:56:38.014 --> 00:56:41.851
Uh, señorita, may I
ask you a question?


700
00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.060
Yes, of course.

701
00:56:43.186 --> 00:56:45.021
Well, now, would
you have any idea


702
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.941
of what might have
happened to the, uh,


703
00:56:48.149 --> 00:56:51.819
deed my father
registered at this office?


704
00:56:52.028 --> 00:56:53.363
It's a complete mystery, señor.

705
00:56:53.571 --> 00:56:56.074
I met your father
when he came here


706
00:56:56.282 --> 00:56:58.201
with the deed and a map.

707
00:56:58.409 --> 00:56:59.953
We made copies
of these documents,


708
00:57:00.161 --> 00:57:01.913
and we sent them
to you in New York.


709
00:57:02.121 --> 00:57:03.748
Didn't you receive them?

710
00:57:03.957 --> 00:57:05.250
There was a fire.

711
00:57:05.458 --> 00:57:08.336
They were destroyed before
I had a chance to read them.


712
00:57:08.545 --> 00:57:11.214
But if there are no
records, that is terrible.


713
00:57:12.507 --> 00:57:14.342
Well, now, you
handled the documents.


714
00:57:14.551 --> 00:57:15.551
Yes.

715
00:57:15.635 --> 00:57:18.221
Is there anything you can
remember about them?


716
00:57:18.429 --> 00:57:19.597
Oh, yes.

717
00:57:23.268 --> 00:57:25.311
It is very strange, señor.

718
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.021
The deed was signed by the chief

719
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:29.190
of the Quetzamal tribe,

720
00:57:29.399 --> 00:57:31.276
but there is no Quetzamal tribe.

721
00:57:31.484 --> 00:57:33.778
According to the history books,

722
00:57:33.987 --> 00:57:36.281
it became extinct 500 years ago,

723
00:57:36.489 --> 00:57:39.284
disappearing into the
jungle without a trace.


724
00:57:39.492 --> 00:57:40.785
But the deed is a trace.

725
00:57:40.994 --> 00:57:42.203
The map is a trace.

726
00:57:42.412 --> 00:57:45.164
I said according to
the history books.


727
00:57:46.416 --> 00:57:49.961
When I was a child, I
lived in a small village


728
00:57:50.169 --> 00:57:51.504
far away in the mountains.

729
00:57:51.713 --> 00:57:53.172
The old people there

730
00:57:53.381 --> 00:57:56.134
used to tell strange
stories of the Quetzamals.


731
00:57:56.342 --> 00:58:00.305
They said they still
existed not very far away,


732
00:58:00.513 --> 00:58:02.974
but we could never
go to their place


733
00:58:03.182 --> 00:58:06.477
because it was over
the edge of the world.


734
00:58:06.686 --> 00:58:08.021
Can you believe this?

735
00:58:10.565 --> 00:58:11.565
Yes.

736
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:15.278
Yes, I think I can.

737
00:58:19.616 --> 00:58:21.326
My father got there.

738
00:58:21.534 --> 00:58:24.454
Somehow, I must get there, too.

739
00:58:24.662 --> 00:58:27.332
You know, I was
planning on returning


740
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:30.501
to my village in a few months...

741
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:34.464
But perhaps I can leave
now and guide you there.


742
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:36.591
Do you mean that?

743
00:58:36.799 --> 00:58:38.801
Yes, absolutely.

744
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:41.763
When would you like to go?

745
00:58:41.971 --> 00:58:45.475
Well, do you think you
could be ready to leave...


746
00:58:45.683 --> 00:58:46.660
In the morning?

747
00:58:46.684 --> 00:58:47.620
Yes.

748
00:58:47.644 --> 00:58:48.644
Miss, uh...

749
00:58:48.728 --> 00:58:50.772
My name is Mona Flores.

750
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:52.315
You may call me Mona.

751
00:58:53.566 --> 00:58:55.318
You may call me Doc.

752
00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:58.529
Yes.

753
00:59:13.252 --> 00:59:17.298
Uh, Señor Savage.

754
00:59:17.507 --> 00:59:19.008
Señor Gorro.

755
00:59:19.217 --> 00:59:22.553
Uh, are you all right?

756
00:59:22.762 --> 00:59:23.846
Shouldn't I be?

757
00:59:24.055 --> 00:59:27.058
Yes, uh, of--of
course, of course.


758
00:59:27.266 --> 00:59:28.434
It's just that I heard

759
00:59:28.643 --> 00:59:30.645
there was some kind
of problem last night.


760
00:59:30.853 --> 00:59:31.853
No.

761
00:59:33.231 --> 00:59:34.607
No problem whatsoever.

762
00:59:36.567 --> 00:59:37.819
Adios, Don Rubio.

763
00:59:43.533 --> 00:59:44.533
Flores!

764
01:01:24.342 --> 01:01:26.552
I've taken care of everything...

765
01:01:26.761 --> 01:01:27.804
Personally.

766
01:01:28.012 --> 01:01:29.012
Good.

767
01:01:29.055 --> 01:01:30.932
I can't understand it.

768
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.225
You had 'em right in your hands,

769
01:01:32.433 --> 01:01:33.684
and you let 'em escape.

770
01:01:33.893 --> 01:01:34.870
I mean, I thought you said

771
01:01:34.894 --> 01:01:35.704
you had everything taken--

772
01:01:35.728 --> 01:01:36.622
Shut up!

773
01:01:36.646 --> 01:01:37.646
Ye-yes, sir.

774
01:01:39.357 --> 01:01:42.109
They--they'll never
find the place.


775
01:01:43.486 --> 01:01:46.155
Only those two know the way.

776
01:01:46.364 --> 01:01:48.074
That dirty little
tramp in my office,


777
01:01:48.282 --> 01:01:49.867
she could never lead
them to Quetzamal.


778
01:01:50.076 --> 01:01:51.702
That's what I'm counting on.

779
01:01:51.911 --> 01:01:53.830
Lots of money is at stake.

780
01:01:54.038 --> 01:01:56.707
Uh, talking about lots of money,

781
01:01:56.916 --> 01:01:59.627
I could use a little money.

782
01:01:59.836 --> 01:02:02.880
Maybe a small advance
on my share, por favor?


783
01:02:03.089 --> 01:02:04.089
Don't bother me now.

784
01:02:04.131 --> 01:02:05.216
Uh, but sir,

785
01:02:05.424 --> 01:02:07.677
don't I deserve a
little consideration?


786
01:02:07.885 --> 01:02:09.887
I mean, after all
now, I was the one


787
01:02:10.096 --> 01:02:13.349
who brought the deed and
the map to your attention.


788
01:02:13.558 --> 01:02:15.852
Uh, we are partners, are we not?

789
01:02:17.436 --> 01:02:19.355
When Savage is out of the way,

790
01:02:19.564 --> 01:02:21.816
that's when we'll
settle accounts.


791
01:02:22.024 --> 01:02:23.776
Any objections?

792
01:02:26.571 --> 01:02:28.281
No, sir.

793
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:38.499
Little touch there.

794
01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:39.792
Little stir.

795
01:02:40.001 --> 01:02:41.043
No two ways about it,

796
01:02:41.252 --> 01:02:42.229
I am a great cook.

797
01:02:42.253 --> 01:02:43.838
Super chef.

798
01:02:44.046 --> 01:02:46.507
Here we go.

799
01:02:48.843 --> 01:02:50.469
Boy, I'm hungry as a bear.

800
01:02:50.678 --> 01:02:51.762
You mean ape,

801
01:02:51.971 --> 01:02:54.640
hungry as an ape.

802
01:02:54.849 --> 01:02:56.058
One of these days,

803
01:02:56.267 --> 01:02:57.685
that two-bit clotheshorse

804
01:02:57.894 --> 01:02:59.770
is gonna go too far.

805
01:02:59.979 --> 01:03:01.314
Mm-mmm.

806
01:03:04.066 --> 01:03:05.902
Needs a little agua, I think.

807
01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:07.110
Would you, uh...

808
01:03:07.278 --> 01:03:08.946
I will get it.

809
01:03:09.155 --> 01:03:10.197
Okay.

810
01:03:40.061 --> 01:03:41.812
It's all right. 
It's all right.

811
01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:43.814
Renny!

812
01:03:45.733 --> 01:03:46.776
Take her.

813
01:03:51.822 --> 01:03:52.949
Monk, bring me a vial.

814
01:03:53.157 --> 01:03:55.117
Right away, Doc.

815
01:03:56.285 --> 01:03:58.829
Jumping jellybeans.

816
01:03:59.038 --> 01:04:00.957
That snake is the spitting image

817
01:04:01.165 --> 01:04:03.376
of the one painted
on the native's chest


818
01:04:03.584 --> 01:04:05.461
at the Eastern
Cranmoor building.


819
01:05:32.631 --> 01:05:34.133
Doc, don't worry.

820
01:05:34.341 --> 01:05:36.677
My village is just
around the bend.


821
01:05:45.936 --> 01:05:47.772
I'm gonna get some more water.

822
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.789
Muchas gracias, señorita.

823
01:06:04.997 --> 01:06:07.249
Moocho Garcia, me, too.

824
01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.797
Delicious, delicious.

825
01:06:13.005 --> 01:06:14.005
No, no, no.

826
01:06:14.131 --> 01:06:15.800
It is only a story,

827
01:06:16.008 --> 01:06:17.551
a legend.

828
01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.137
There is no such a
place as Quetzamal.


829
01:06:20.346 --> 01:06:23.140
But Don Jose, my grandfather

830
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:25.684
once told me that you
and he made a trip there


831
01:06:25.893 --> 01:06:27.686
when you were very young boys.

832
01:06:27.895 --> 01:06:29.980
I never been to Quetzamal,

833
01:06:30.189 --> 01:06:32.483
only to the edge of the world.

834
01:06:32.691 --> 01:06:34.110
Don Jose...

835
01:06:35.945 --> 01:06:39.198
Do you think you
could lead us there?


836
01:06:39.406 --> 01:06:40.825
It's very important.

837
01:06:41.033 --> 01:06:43.119
Por favor. Please.

838
01:06:46.705 --> 01:06:47.915
Very well,

839
01:06:48.124 --> 01:06:50.417
but only as a favor to Mona

840
01:06:50.626 --> 01:06:51.626
because I know her

841
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:54.713
since she was
such a little señorita.


842
01:06:54.922 --> 01:06:56.132
Ah, thank you.

843
01:06:58.634 --> 01:07:01.512
Come back here tomorrow at dawn.

844
01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.763
Gracias, señor.

845
01:07:02.972 --> 01:07:04.640
Gracias.

846
01:07:04.849 --> 01:07:06.225
Adios.

847
01:07:06.433 --> 01:07:07.601
Adios.

848
01:07:10.855 --> 01:07:12.022
We need more horses,

849
01:07:12.231 --> 01:07:14.233
and we must have
food from the village.


850
01:07:14.441 --> 01:07:16.235
That's all been taken care of.

851
01:07:16.443 --> 01:07:18.821
But it may take
days to get there.


852
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:20.656
You've brought
us this far, Mona,


853
01:07:20.865 --> 01:07:21.865
and I thank you,

854
01:07:22.032 --> 01:07:23.701
but it would be
wrong to expose you


855
01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:25.786
to any more danger
on our account.


856
01:07:27.163 --> 01:07:29.123
But I want to go with you.

857
01:07:29.331 --> 01:07:30.958
I'm not afraid, Doc.

858
01:07:31.167 --> 01:07:33.043
Well, I know you're not...

859
01:07:34.086 --> 01:07:35.421
But for your own safety,

860
01:07:35.629 --> 01:07:37.965
I think it's best
you remain here,


861
01:07:38.174 --> 01:07:40.176
this village with
your own people.


862
01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.260
No.

863
01:07:46.473 --> 01:07:47.641
I love you.

864
01:07:53.606 --> 01:07:57.902
Ah, there's no room in
my life for love, Mona.


865
01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:00.279
But why, Doc?

866
01:08:05.075 --> 01:08:07.077
There was a girl once.

867
01:08:07.286 --> 01:08:08.495
We were to be married.

868
01:08:08.704 --> 01:08:09.704
She was kidnapped

869
01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:11.332
by the men I had been pursuing.

870
01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.418
They threatened to kill
her if I didn't drop the chase.


871
01:08:14.627 --> 01:08:17.213
I gave in. I had to.

872
01:08:18.422 --> 01:08:21.592
Later, when she was
returned safely to me,


873
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.845
I realized there could
never be a future for us.


874
01:08:25.054 --> 01:08:27.223
I realized if I were to do

875
01:08:27.431 --> 01:08:29.767
what I had chosen with my life,

876
01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:31.268
there could never be a loved one

877
01:08:31.477 --> 01:08:34.146
who could be used against me...

878
01:08:35.105 --> 01:08:37.316
Or harmed because of me.

879
01:08:39.109 --> 01:08:40.527
Do you understand?

880
01:08:42.238 --> 01:08:44.073
I suppose so.

881
01:08:50.955 --> 01:08:51.955
Mona...

882
01:08:53.624 --> 01:08:54.750
You're a brick.

883
01:11:37.246 --> 01:11:38.705
I'm gonna watch the horses.

884
01:11:40.707 --> 01:11:41.708
Yeah. Okay.

885
01:11:48.715 --> 01:11:50.592
Here it is,

886
01:11:50.801 --> 01:11:51.844
the edge of the world.

887
01:11:52.052 --> 01:11:54.221
Below in the valley
of the vanished,


888
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:55.806
live the Quetzamals.

889
01:11:56.014 --> 01:11:58.642
There is no way down.

890
01:11:58.851 --> 01:12:00.686
And now adios, amigos.

891
01:12:00.894 --> 01:12:01.894
I must return.

892
01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.667
Vaya con dios!

893
01:12:23.876 --> 01:12:25.461
Remember me to Mona!

894
01:12:26.628 --> 01:12:27.628
I will!

895
01:12:29.047 --> 01:12:31.884
There must be a way down.

896
01:12:32.092 --> 01:12:34.136
My father found it.

897
01:12:34.344 --> 01:12:36.763
Well, let's look for it.

898
01:12:58.911 --> 01:13:00.829
Doc!

899
01:13:01.038 --> 01:13:02.289
These rocks.

900
01:13:02.498 --> 01:13:05.459
Unordinary divarication.

901
01:13:11.465 --> 01:13:12.549
Right.

902
01:13:23.727 --> 01:13:26.230
What is it, Doc?

903
01:13:27.356 --> 01:13:29.358
It's a message...

904
01:13:29.566 --> 01:13:32.694
From my father.

905
01:13:32.903 --> 01:13:34.905
"La-too-ah...

906
01:13:35.113 --> 01:13:36.657
Spin-oh-sa."

907
01:13:36.865 --> 01:13:37.865
La-too-ah-spin-oh-sa.

908
01:13:37.991 --> 01:13:39.284
Who's he?

909
01:13:39.493 --> 01:13:41.703
He ain't a he. It's
an it, Harvard man,


910
01:13:41.912 --> 01:13:44.373
a rare semi-tropical bush, see?

911
01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:45.581
Neh!

912
01:14:10.315 --> 01:14:12.734
Gentlemen, my father was right.

913
01:14:12.943 --> 01:14:14.444
Bring the horses.

914
01:14:40.095 --> 01:14:41.597
Whoa!

915
01:14:42.764 --> 01:14:43.890
You all right, Monk?

916
01:14:44.099 --> 01:14:45.809
Yeah, I'm OK.

917
01:16:11.645 --> 01:16:13.313
Johnny?

918
01:16:21.488 --> 01:16:25.409
Jupiter, what a phenomenosity!

919
01:16:25.617 --> 01:16:26.993
It's gold.

920
01:16:27.202 --> 01:16:30.122
A pool of gold.

921
01:16:38.463 --> 01:16:41.508
Gentlemen, I think
I'll go scout around.


922
01:16:41.717 --> 01:16:43.009
You remain here.

923
01:16:43.218 --> 01:16:44.511
Sure thing, Doc.

924
01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.697
Take care.

925
01:16:45.721 --> 01:16:46.722
Don't worry.

926
01:16:52.519 --> 01:16:53.979
Gee...

927
01:16:54.187 --> 01:16:55.981
Those are Captain Seas' men

928
01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:57.524
storing gold in that hut.

929
01:17:16.668 --> 01:17:18.462
Get in there. Keep quiet.

930
01:17:18.670 --> 01:17:19.670
Put your hands up!

931
01:17:21.548 --> 01:17:23.341
Up! Up!

932
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:24.843
Get moving!

933
01:17:25.051 --> 01:17:26.845
I say! It's deplorable!

934
01:17:27.053 --> 01:17:28.263
Hurry up.

935
01:17:28.472 --> 01:17:31.266
I'm a lawyer. I'll
sue you for this.


936
01:17:31.475 --> 01:17:33.477
Simply deplorable. Horrible.

937
01:17:39.024 --> 01:17:40.859
I followed you.

938
01:17:41.067 --> 01:17:43.695
I wanted to be with...

939
01:17:43.904 --> 01:17:44.904
I'm sorry.

940
01:17:45.071 --> 01:17:46.573
Get moving.

941
01:18:04.841 --> 01:18:06.218
My compliments, gentlemen.

942
01:18:06.426 --> 01:18:09.221
You have eluded
me at every turn.


943
01:18:09.429 --> 01:18:12.724
You have even managed
to find the pool of gold,


944
01:18:12.933 --> 01:18:16.478
but this time,
there is no escape.


945
01:18:16.686 --> 01:18:18.146
Mr. Seas...

946
01:18:18.355 --> 01:18:21.274
As the representative
of Clark Savage Jr.,


947
01:18:21.483 --> 01:18:24.861
I must vehemently
protest in his absence


948
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:27.280
and warn you that your actions

949
01:18:27.489 --> 01:18:30.784
are contradictory to the
existing laws of the United States,


950
01:18:30.992 --> 01:18:32.994
as well as the
republic of Hidalgo.


951
01:18:33.203 --> 01:18:35.205
Heh heh heh! You don't say?

952
01:18:35.413 --> 01:18:36.915
You are not only trespassing

953
01:18:37.123 --> 01:18:39.251
on my client's legal property,

954
01:18:39.459 --> 01:18:43.588
duly registered with the land
recorder's office of Hidalgo,


955
01:18:43.797 --> 01:18:48.343
but you are also unlawfully
exploiting his inheritance,


956
01:18:48.552 --> 01:18:52.764
as well as the labor of
the natives of this tribe.


957
01:18:52.973 --> 01:18:55.851
This is the law
here, Harvard man.


958
01:18:56.059 --> 01:18:58.311
The law of the jungle.

959
01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.729
You dirty skunk!

960
01:18:59.938 --> 01:19:00.938
Hyah!

961
01:19:01.022 --> 01:19:02.482
Yes! Get him!

962
01:19:11.575 --> 01:19:12.951
You!

963
01:19:13.159 --> 01:19:15.370
Get rid of them right now!

964
01:19:18.874 --> 01:19:20.625
Get rid of them, I said!

965
01:19:25.297 --> 01:19:26.715
I will prepare the potion.

966
01:19:26.923 --> 01:19:28.133
No, Kulkan.

967
01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:31.303
The green death is a
heritage from our ancestors,


968
01:19:31.511 --> 01:19:34.222
only to defend ourselves
against our enemies.


969
01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:37.767
It has not been used
for hundreds of years.


970
01:19:37.976 --> 01:19:39.269
You do not understand.

971
01:19:39.477 --> 01:19:41.855
Captain seas is our friend.

972
01:19:42.063 --> 01:19:43.899
His enemies are our enemies.

973
01:19:44.107 --> 01:19:46.860
You are deserting
your own people.


974
01:19:47.068 --> 01:19:48.862
You are joining with strangers

975
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:50.822
who have taken away our freedom.

976
01:19:51.031 --> 01:19:52.282
Shut up, you old fool.

977
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:55.577
I told you I'd make
you rich, didn't I?


978
01:19:55.785 --> 01:19:58.455
Wealth means nothing to us.

979
01:19:58.663 --> 01:20:00.540
Put him with the others.

980
01:20:16.973 --> 01:20:18.767
Take them away!

981
01:20:22.604 --> 01:20:23.939
Now get Savage.

982
01:20:24.147 --> 01:20:25.774
He can't be far away.

983
01:20:52.092 --> 01:20:53.510
Arankanalla!

984
01:20:53.718 --> 01:20:55.345
Arankanalla!

985
01:21:01.017 --> 01:21:03.395
Areeabooboo!

986
01:21:03.603 --> 01:21:04.646
Areeabooboo!

987
01:21:21.496 --> 01:21:24.374
That was truly noble of
you, Monk, what you did.


988
01:21:24.582 --> 01:21:27.752
I want you to know
that I appreciate it.


989
01:21:27.961 --> 01:21:28.962
That's okay.

990
01:21:29.170 --> 01:21:30.422
Anytime.

991
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:32.674
You could have
been killed, you know.


992
01:21:35.051 --> 01:21:38.763
Oh, uh, well,
anything for a pal.


993
01:21:38.972 --> 01:21:43.184
Say, chief, how come you
speak such good English?


994
01:21:43.393 --> 01:21:45.895
Professor Savage saw to that.

995
01:21:46.104 --> 01:21:47.313
Mmm!

996
01:21:51.609 --> 01:21:53.778
What happens now?

997
01:21:53.987 --> 01:21:56.906
We're all doomed to die...

998
01:21:57.115 --> 01:21:58.491
A horrible death.

999
01:22:45.455 --> 01:22:48.124
This place gives me
the heebie-jeebies.


1000
01:22:48.333 --> 01:22:50.210
We got to bust out of here.

1001
01:22:50.418 --> 01:22:53.213
An unconfuted veracity,
but how, may I ask,


1002
01:22:53.421 --> 01:22:54.839
with our hands tied
behind our backs


1003
01:22:55.048 --> 01:22:56.049
and locked in this--

1004
01:22:56.257 --> 01:22:57.257
that's it!

1005
01:22:57.342 --> 01:22:58.551
That's it! Untie me.

1006
01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:01.304
If only they hadn't taken
my sword cane away.


1007
01:23:01.513 --> 01:23:03.181
If I had my thingamajig...

1008
01:23:03.389 --> 01:23:06.726
An unravelable
configuration of knots.


1009
01:23:06.935 --> 01:23:07.935
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

1010
01:23:07.977 --> 01:23:08.977
I got a idea!

1011
01:23:09.062 --> 01:23:10.313
Habeas Corpus!

1012
01:23:10.522 --> 01:23:13.566
Sorry, Ham. I know
you don't like that name.


1013
01:23:13.775 --> 01:23:14.901
Oh, that's all right...

1014
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:16.110
Pal.

1015
01:23:16.194 --> 01:23:19.739
H.C., you still in my pocket?

1016
01:23:21.199 --> 01:23:24.661
Well, get out and do
that trick I taught you.


1017
01:23:47.559 --> 01:23:48.893
Good boy, Habeas!

1018
01:23:49.102 --> 01:23:50.079
Well done!

1019
01:23:50.103 --> 01:23:51.187
Well, come on, Monk.

1020
01:23:51.396 --> 01:23:53.565
Hurry up and untie me.

1021
01:24:15.587 --> 01:24:16.921
Come on, fellas.

1022
01:24:17.130 --> 01:24:18.715
Let's move that rock
and fight our way out.


1023
01:24:18.923 --> 01:24:20.717
Yeah. Fight our way out!

1024
01:24:20.925 --> 01:24:22.552
Whoa!

1025
01:24:51.039 --> 01:24:52.415
Aah!

1026
01:24:54.042 --> 01:24:55.042
Heh heh heh!

1027
01:24:55.126 --> 01:24:57.420
Perfect, Kulkan. Perfect.

1028
01:24:57.629 --> 01:24:58.564
They're finished,

1029
01:24:58.588 --> 01:24:59.964
just like that old professor

1030
01:25:00.173 --> 01:25:01.925
and that liar of a pilot.

1031
01:25:02.133 --> 01:25:05.511
Heh heh heh heh!

1032
01:25:09.933 --> 01:25:11.351
Aah!

1033
01:25:11.559 --> 01:25:13.228
Aah!

1034
01:25:20.777 --> 01:25:25.156
And we have the papers,
the deed, and the pool of gold.


1035
01:25:25.365 --> 01:25:28.409
Right. Now only Savage remains.

1036
01:25:28.618 --> 01:25:31.120
Uhh!

1037
01:25:31.329 --> 01:25:33.748
Tell your men to stand
back, drop their guns.


1038
01:25:36.793 --> 01:25:38.169
Have no fear!

1039
01:25:38.378 --> 01:25:43.132
Doc Savage is here!

1040
01:25:43.341 --> 01:25:45.301
Now tell your men
to open this cave.


1041
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:48.846
Tell them to open the cave,

1042
01:25:49.055 --> 01:25:51.391
or you're a dead
man in five seconds.


1043
01:25:51.599 --> 01:25:53.434
Open the cave!

1044
01:25:54.602 --> 01:25:56.104
Arankanalla!

1045
01:26:03.111 --> 01:26:05.238
Hypodermic. Antidote.

1046
01:26:05.446 --> 01:26:08.366
Inject yourself, then
inject the others.


1047
01:26:09.659 --> 01:26:11.035
Hyah! Uhh!

1048
01:26:18.793 --> 01:26:20.461
The--the green death!

1049
01:26:34.017 --> 01:26:36.144
Aah!

1050
01:26:39.689 --> 01:26:41.649
Oh! Uhh! Aah!

1051
01:26:41.858 --> 01:26:44.360
Aah!

1052
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:49.615
Aah!

1053
01:27:10.053 --> 01:27:11.888
Rahhr!

1054
01:27:12.096 --> 01:27:14.140
Rahhr!

1055
01:27:17.727 --> 01:27:19.228
Rahhr!

1056
01:27:46.547 --> 01:27:47.547
Ah!

1057
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:49.217
Hyah!

1058
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:20.248
Aah!

1059
01:28:42.603 --> 01:28:43.771
Heh heh heh heh!

1060
01:29:30.526 --> 01:29:32.403
Ah! Ah! Ow!

1061
01:29:32.612 --> 01:29:33.654
Ow! Ow!

1062
01:29:33.863 --> 01:29:35.448
Ooh!

1063
01:29:35.656 --> 01:29:37.492
No! Stop!

1064
01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:38.700
Stop!

1065
01:29:38.868 --> 01:29:39.869
Thieves!

1066
01:29:40.077 --> 01:29:42.163
You won't get away with this!

1067
01:29:42.371 --> 01:29:45.374
It belongs to me
and the captain!


1068
01:29:59.764 --> 01:30:01.307
It's my gold!

1069
01:30:01.516 --> 01:30:02.558
It's mine!

1070
01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.187
Come back, I say!

1071
01:30:11.567 --> 01:30:14.403
Hy...

1072
01:30:14.612 --> 01:30:17.490
Aaah!

1073
01:30:19.450 --> 01:30:22.203
You won't get away with this!

1074
01:30:35.132 --> 01:30:36.342
Come back!

1075
01:30:36.551 --> 01:30:37.319
Come back!

1076
01:30:37.343 --> 01:30:38.636
Come back, you!

1077
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:02.368
Ooh!

1078
01:31:16.716 --> 01:31:18.050
Everyone all right?

1079
01:31:18.259 --> 01:31:20.803
You're a sight for sore eyes.

1080
01:31:23.055 --> 01:31:24.807
It's my gold!

1081
01:31:25.016 --> 01:31:26.976
The gold is mine!

1082
01:31:27.184 --> 01:31:29.312
What the devil's going on?

1083
01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:32.898
That dynamite must
have triggered an eruption.


1084
01:31:33.107 --> 01:31:36.402
Mother nature aroused,
seeking revenge.


1085
01:31:36.611 --> 01:31:39.196
Come back!

1086
01:31:46.787 --> 01:31:48.039
Sure you're okay?

1087
01:31:48.247 --> 01:31:50.041
Yes, I'm fine, Doc, but--

1088
01:31:50.249 --> 01:31:51.917
Marks on your
face are going away.


1089
01:31:52.126 --> 01:31:54.462
How do you feel?

1090
01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:57.130
I feel better.

1091
01:31:57.298 --> 01:31:58.299
Thanks, Monk.

1092
01:31:58.507 --> 01:31:59.276
Yes.

1093
01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:00.193
How about you?

1094
01:32:00.217 --> 01:32:01.802
Fine.

1095
01:32:02.011 --> 01:32:04.180
The epicenter is quite near.

1096
01:32:04.388 --> 01:32:06.641
There should be one
more brief disturbance


1097
01:32:06.849 --> 01:32:08.184
about...

1098
01:32:08.392 --> 01:32:09.392
Now.

1099
01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.645
Whoa!

1100
01:33:12.164 --> 01:33:13.999
Habeas! Come back here!

1101
01:33:14.208 --> 01:33:16.377
Habeas Corpus, come back here!

1102
01:33:16.585 --> 01:33:17.585
You son of a pig!

1103
01:33:17.628 --> 01:33:19.171
Come back, I tell ya!

1104
01:33:24.635 --> 01:33:25.635
Good boy.

1105
01:33:34.603 --> 01:33:35.603
Good piggy.

1106
01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:36.772
Nice piggy.

1107
01:33:36.981 --> 01:33:38.315
May I?

1108
01:33:39.650 --> 01:33:41.527
Cute piggie.

1109
01:33:43.028 --> 01:33:44.321
Help!

1110
01:33:51.495 --> 01:33:52.538
Help?

1111
01:33:54.373 --> 01:33:57.710
Strange how
history repeats itself.


1112
01:33:57.918 --> 01:34:00.546
First, your father saved
us against the plague.


1113
01:34:00.755 --> 01:34:05.092
Then you came, my son,
to save us from slavery.


1114
01:34:05.301 --> 01:34:08.012
We gave him, as an
expression of gratitude,


1115
01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:09.805
the pool of gold.

1116
01:34:10.014 --> 01:34:12.183
Now the land and the gold

1117
01:34:12.391 --> 01:34:15.603
belong to you, Doc Savage.

1118
01:34:15.811 --> 01:34:17.855
Thank you, Chief Chaac.

1119
01:34:18.063 --> 01:34:21.442
I promise to continue
my father's work...


1120
01:34:21.650 --> 01:34:23.194
His ideals.

1121
01:34:23.402 --> 01:34:25.863
With this limitless
wealth at my disposal,


1122
01:34:26.071 --> 01:34:27.740
I shall be able
to devote my life


1123
01:34:27.948 --> 01:34:29.325
to the cause of justice.

1124
01:34:30.826 --> 01:34:32.161
Goodbye.

1125
01:34:35.539 --> 01:34:36.665
Goodbye, Doc.

1126
01:34:36.874 --> 01:34:38.375
I will stay here,

1127
01:34:38.584 --> 01:34:42.713
and then I will return to my
village to help my people.


1128
01:34:42.922 --> 01:34:43.923
Will you come back...

1129
01:34:44.131 --> 01:34:45.131
Someday?

1130
01:34:45.174 --> 01:34:46.592
I'm sure I will...

1131
01:34:46.801 --> 01:34:48.219
Someday.

1132
01:35:29.426 --> 01:35:30.928
Are you going to kill me now?

1133
01:35:31.136 --> 01:35:32.888
No. Doc don't
believe in killing,


1134
01:35:33.097 --> 01:35:34.682
not even crooks like you.

1135
01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:36.976
He's got his own methods
of dealing with them.


1136
01:35:37.184 --> 01:35:38.185
What methods?

1137
01:35:38.394 --> 01:35:40.187
Well, first we're
going to take you


1138
01:35:40.396 --> 01:35:42.147
to a place in upper
New York state,


1139
01:35:42.356 --> 01:35:46.110
where Doc has his own
rehabilitation center.


1140
01:35:46.318 --> 01:35:50.322
There, Doc will perform a
special kind of acupuncture surgery


1141
01:35:50.531 --> 01:35:51.531
on your brain,

1142
01:35:51.615 --> 01:35:54.910
which will help rid
you of your evil nature.


1143
01:35:55.119 --> 01:35:56.912
He learned about
this kind of stuff


1144
01:35:57.121 --> 01:35:58.205
in a remote monastery

1145
01:35:58.414 --> 01:36:00.332
on his last trip to
China, you see.


1146
01:36:00.541 --> 01:36:04.336
You're also going to be
taught good citizenship


1147
01:36:04.545 --> 01:36:06.088
and an honest trade,

1148
01:36:06.297 --> 01:36:10.134
then one day, you'll leave
the center completely well


1149
01:36:10.342 --> 01:36:14.388
and become a respectable
member of society.


1150
01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:27.335
Thanks.

1151
01:36:27.359 --> 01:36:29.486
Thank you, young man.

1152
01:36:39.038 --> 01:36:41.123
Merry Christmas to you!

1153
01:36:51.216 --> 01:36:52.216
God bless you, madam.

1154
01:37:19.161 --> 01:37:21.163
This is Clark Savage, Jr.

1155
01:37:21.372 --> 01:37:23.666
I am not currently available.

1156
01:37:23.874 --> 01:37:26.168
However, if you wish
to leave a message,


1157
01:37:26.377 --> 01:37:28.170
it will be recorded.

1158
01:37:28.379 --> 01:37:29.838
You may speak now.

1159
01:37:30.047 --> 01:37:32.132
Doc, hey, Doc, listen.

1160
01:37:32.341 --> 01:37:33.842
This is an emergency.

1161
01:37:34.051 --> 01:37:36.387
I'm at the Warfield drugstore.

1162
01:38:04.289 --> 01:38:07.126
Doc, hey, Doc, listen.

1163
01:38:07.334 --> 01:38:08.836
This is an emergency.

1164
01:38:09.044 --> 01:38:11.130
I'm at the Warfield drugstore.

1165
01:38:11.338 --> 01:38:13.924
I just learned something,
something terrible.


1166
01:38:14.133 --> 01:38:16.135
Millions of people
are going to get killed.


1167
01:38:16.343 --> 01:38:18.345
You're the only one who--

1168
01:38:18.554 --> 01:38:19.531
ah!

1169
01:38:19.555 --> 01:38:20.532
Argh! Ugh!

1170
01:38:20.556 --> 01:38:21.849
Uhh!

1171
01:40:01.156 --> 01:40:02.199
Savage!
