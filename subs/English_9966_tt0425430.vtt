1
00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:24.304
It's okay. Mommy's here, okay?

2
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:31.507
I need you to
be a big boy, okay?

3
00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:42.723
Get under the bed. Get under the bed.
Right now. Quick. Quick.


4
00:01:46.863 --> 00:01:48.854
Please, leave us alone!

5
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.945
Where's Mom? Where's...

6
00:02:09.018 --> 00:02:10.679
Go, Michael, go!

7
00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:16.549
No!

8
00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:27.933
Michael.

9
00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:30.800
Michael, run!

10
00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:18.459
You're going to run down the battery.

11
00:06:20.937 --> 00:06:23.770
Like you could get
a signal around here anyway.


12
00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:28.435
Luckily, people out here remember you can
have conversations without those things.


13
00:06:31.047 --> 00:06:33.038
It's okay, buddy.

14
00:06:33.115 --> 00:06:35.879
Be careful not to unbuckle his seatbelt.

15
00:06:36.018 --> 00:06:37.246
I'm not.

16
00:06:43.326 --> 00:06:46.352
We're here. How about that?

17
00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:25.694
No going back now.

18
00:07:26.135 --> 00:07:28.899
We couldn't afford it
even if we wanted to.

19
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:32.771
I know it's a bit run-down,
but wait till you see the inside.


20
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.910
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Denise, check out the water pump.


21
00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:39.709
You want to come
see your new back yard?

22
00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:42.240
Yeah? It's big.

23
00:08:48.217 --> 00:08:50.947
- Still works.
- Yeah, I'm impressed.


24
00:08:56.859 --> 00:08:57.848
I know you're worried.

25
00:08:57.927 --> 00:09:02.728
But a couple of days and I'll have everything
here running like new. I promise.


26
00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:04.663
Even that?

27
00:09:08.304 --> 00:09:10.272
All right. Maybe a week.

28
00:09:12.408 --> 00:09:14.501
Still think we can do this?

29
00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:18.312
Climate's right. 
The soil reports are great.

30
00:09:19.115 --> 00:09:20.980
Listen, I know I couldn't make this work
in the city.


31
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.848
But this is something I know.

32
00:10:26.182 --> 00:10:27.410
Jess.

33
00:10:29.018 --> 00:10:31.509
Jess, come help with these bags.

34
00:10:34.957 --> 00:10:37.255
What do you think of the house?

35
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:39.853
Neat.

36
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.461
Help us unload.

37
00:10:42.598 --> 00:10:44.463
If we want anything to sleep on tonight,
we got to get moving.


38
00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:45.625
Okay.

39
00:10:46.235 --> 00:10:47.429
Neat.

40
00:11:56.805 --> 00:11:59.103
I think she's going to be okay.

41
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.177
Well, at least she's talking to us.
I guess that's a start.


42
00:12:08.918 --> 00:12:10.010
Yeah.

43
00:12:13.856 --> 00:12:16.154
I love it out here, you know.

44
00:12:27.169 --> 00:12:29.637
- Hey.
- Hey.


45
00:12:30.739 --> 00:12:32.263
How's it going?

46
00:12:35.911 --> 00:12:37.811
It's so quiet out here.

47
00:12:38.514 --> 00:12:41.347
Yeah. It takes some getting used to, huh?

48
00:12:53.696 --> 00:12:57.427
You know, bringing you out here
wasn't a punishment, Jessica.


49
00:12:57.499 --> 00:12:59.899
It's an adjustment for everybody.

50
00:13:01.437 --> 00:13:04.497
And the only way
we're going to make this work


51
00:13:04.573 --> 00:13:06.666
is if we give it a chance.

52
00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:13.239
"I'll take that as a good point, Dad.

53
00:13:13.315 --> 00:13:15.840
"You're right. 
You're always right."

54
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.625
Good night.

55
00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:30.955
Get some sleep.

56
00:13:45.314 --> 00:13:47.111
Don't give up, honey!

57
00:13:49.385 --> 00:13:51.376
Don't worry. I'll get it.

58
00:13:52.821 --> 00:13:54.049
Come on.

59
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.218
Come on.

60
00:13:56.792 --> 00:13:57.952
Come on.

61
00:13:58.027 --> 00:14:00.552
Come on. That's right. Come on.

62
00:14:03.465 --> 00:14:05.990
He did it! High-five. High-five.

63
00:14:10.606 --> 00:14:11.698
He did it!

64
00:14:46.508 --> 00:14:47.907
Roy Solomon?

65
00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:50.939
Colby Price. Belton Savings.

66
00:14:51.013 --> 00:14:53.538
Oh, hey. Good to meet you.

67
00:14:54.516 --> 00:14:57.917
So you said
your father grew sunflowers, too.


68
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.080
Yeah, over in Turek County.

69
00:15:02.624 --> 00:15:04.489
I grew up not too far from here.

70
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.720
Right.

71
00:15:06.762 --> 00:15:09.322
Look, I know you're all moved in,

72
00:15:09.398 --> 00:15:13.892
but an opportunity came up at the bank
that I thought you might be interested in.


73
00:15:13.969 --> 00:15:16.961
This place sat gathering dust for years
until you came along and bought it,


74
00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:19.507
and now, as it happens,

75
00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:22.908
another party's expressed interest
in the farm.


76
00:15:22.978 --> 00:15:24.605
The good news is,
they're willing to pay what you paid


77
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.513
and put another 15% on top of that.

78
00:15:31.787 --> 00:15:33.721
We just got here.

79
00:15:33.789 --> 00:15:35.120
And frankly,

80
00:15:35.858 --> 00:15:39.225
my family's looking for a little stability
right now.


81
00:15:40.596 --> 00:15:43.292
Well, this will give you the details.

82
00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:46.929
Give me a call if
you want to discuss it.

83
00:15:50.272 --> 00:15:51.603
Thanks, I will.

84
00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:58.046
Hey, Benny.

85
00:15:58.113 --> 00:15:59.478
I'm coming.

86
00:16:14.796 --> 00:16:16.127
You ready?

87
00:16:22.604 --> 00:16:24.003
Oh, great.

88
00:17:14.356 --> 00:17:15.550
Ben?

89
00:17:33.342 --> 00:17:34.400
Ben?

90
00:17:46.922 --> 00:17:49.049
Hey, sport.

91
00:17:49.124 --> 00:17:51.149
I thought you were asleep.

92
00:17:51.927 --> 00:17:54.259
How'd you get out of bed, sport?

93
00:17:55.764 --> 00:17:57.789
I thought you were...

94
00:18:06.742 --> 00:18:08.972
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

95
00:18:09.611 --> 00:18:10.600
Okay.

96
00:18:12.848 --> 00:18:16.147
All right, Ben.
Now you try to get some sleep now, okay?


97
00:18:16.785 --> 00:18:20.482
Lay down. Go to sleep. Good boy.

98
00:18:21.189 --> 00:18:22.781
Daddy loves you.

99
00:18:46.748 --> 00:18:47.840
What?

100
00:19:10.138 --> 00:19:11.867
What are you doing?

101
00:19:12.107 --> 00:19:14.905
- Going to town.
- I don't think so, Jess.


102
00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:17.438
Give me the keys.

103
00:19:17.512 --> 00:19:19.844
I just had them, like, two seconds ago.

104
00:19:21.817 --> 00:19:24.047
Thanks, Jess. You ready to go?

105
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.112
Jess?

106
00:19:28.357 --> 00:19:30.120
What's up with that?

107
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.260
It was me, not her.

108
00:19:33.328 --> 00:19:35.728
I thought she was taking the car.

109
00:19:37.432 --> 00:19:39.730
Don't beat yourself up over it.

110
00:19:41.503 --> 00:19:45.564
By the way, your son managed to climb
out of his crib last night.


111
00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.005
That's new.

112
00:19:47.709 --> 00:19:48.801
Yeah.

113
00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:52.942
So are the things
I'm gonna do to you

114
00:19:54.349 --> 00:19:57.045
when I come in from the fields tonight.

115
00:19:57.886 --> 00:19:59.751
- New things, huh?
- Oh, yeah.


116
00:20:00.722 --> 00:20:03.213
I've been reading the farmer-sutra.

117
00:20:04.693 --> 00:20:05.557
See you.

118
00:20:26.148 --> 00:20:30.983
- There you go. You have a good day now.
- Thanks, Ed.


119
00:20:31.052 --> 00:20:33.043
Well, you're the new folks in town, right?

120
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:34.986
Yeah, Roy Solomon.

121
00:20:35.056 --> 00:20:37.456
- So what do you plant?
- Sunflowers.


122
00:20:37.526 --> 00:20:40.222
All right. Let me help you get started.

123
00:20:41.496 --> 00:20:43.828
Hey, mind if I go look around?

124
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.932
Okay.

125
00:20:50.005 --> 00:20:52.530
Hey, don't go too far.

126
00:22:46.454 --> 00:22:47.819
Hey, buddy.

127
00:22:49.724 --> 00:22:52.352
Hey, what're you looking at?

128
00:22:57.899 --> 00:23:00.129
You didn't get to finish your cereal.

129
00:23:01.603 --> 00:23:05.437
And Daddy said you got out of the crib
last night all by yourself.


130
00:23:05.941 --> 00:23:08.273
Did you do that all by yourself?

131
00:23:11.746 --> 00:23:13.680
Nice!

132
00:23:15.283 --> 00:23:16.545
Pass it up.

133
00:23:16.985 --> 00:23:17.974
Got it.

134
00:23:18.086 --> 00:23:19.075
You're all over him.

135
00:23:20.555 --> 00:23:22.045
- Get up! Get up!
- Take it!


136
00:23:23.191 --> 00:23:25.557
- Come on, Bobby. What was that?
- Come on.


137
00:23:26.027 --> 00:23:27.426
Little help?

138
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.324
Thanks.

139
00:23:36.504 --> 00:23:39.029
- It's all in the wrists.
- Right.


140
00:23:39.107 --> 00:23:40.574
I'm Bobby.

141
00:23:40.642 --> 00:23:41.870
Jess.

142
00:23:41.977 --> 00:23:45.606
Welcome to North Dakota, Jess.
You're from Chicago, right?


143
00:23:46.247 --> 00:23:48.943
Yeah. How'd you know that?

144
00:23:49.718 --> 00:23:54.155
Small town. Everybody knows everything.
You might want to remember that.


145
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.525
So what do you guys
do for fun out here?

146
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:01.758
You're looking at it.

147
00:24:03.098 --> 00:24:04.258
Sweet.

148
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.158
Half now and half at harvest.
That's the best I can do.


149
00:24:12.974 --> 00:24:14.373
I appreciate it.

150
00:24:14.442 --> 00:24:19.004
And if you're looking for labor,
it's gotten cheap with all the unemployment.


151
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:24.616
I can't afford much now,
but I'll keep it in mind. Thanks, Ed.


152
00:24:27.622 --> 00:24:29.556
You're kicking my ass.

153
00:24:30.525 --> 00:24:32.755
Yeah, it's all in the wrists.

154
00:24:32.827 --> 00:24:35.660
Come on, you played in Chicago, right?

155
00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.528
Well, I used to. 
I played in junior high.

156
00:24:39.668 --> 00:24:41.033
Yeah? What happened?

157
00:24:41.102 --> 00:24:45.368
I don't know.
I guess I just got into other things.


158
00:24:46.174 --> 00:24:48.972
Well, the girls' team here is for shit.

159
00:24:59.888 --> 00:25:02.448
Yeah, boys' is too, if you're on it.

160
00:25:04.793 --> 00:25:06.021
Nice one, bro.

161
00:25:10.331 --> 00:25:15.564
Hey, you know, if you ever get bored
of doing nothing out at the farm,


162
00:25:18.139 --> 00:25:21.438
I could always swing
by and pick you up,

163
00:25:21.509 --> 00:25:25.809
and we could go do nothing
someplace else.


164
00:25:28.083 --> 00:25:29.573
Yeah, maybe.

165
00:25:34.989 --> 00:25:36.650
Hey, I got to go.

166
00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:40.393
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.


167
00:25:44.432 --> 00:25:46.059
Nice to meet you.

168
00:25:50.538 --> 00:25:52.506
Hey, who was that kid?

169
00:25:53.975 --> 00:25:55.465
Just some guy.

170
00:25:57.412 --> 00:25:59.039
From around here?

171
00:26:00.281 --> 00:26:02.875
No. He commutes to shoot hoops.

172
00:26:03.885 --> 00:26:05.409
You get his number?

173
00:26:05.487 --> 00:26:06.545
Dad.

174
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:07.918
If you want to go back,
if you're too embarrassed,


175
00:26:07.989 --> 00:26:10.423
- I'll get his number for you.
- Dad.


176
00:26:18.199 --> 00:26:22.863
You know, I think you and your mom would
have a lot to talk about if you give it a try.


177
00:26:27.942 --> 00:26:30.376
We're all in this together, Jess.

178
00:26:47.862 --> 00:26:50.456
So I'll go see if Mom needs anything.

179
00:26:50.965 --> 00:26:52.762
Okay. Sure.

180
00:26:58.139 --> 00:27:00.004
How was town?

181
00:27:00.074 --> 00:27:01.234
Small.

182
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:06.412
Hey, Jess, I'm really sorry about earlier.

183
00:27:09.317 --> 00:27:10.648
It's okay.

184
00:27:13.054 --> 00:27:15.318
Need me to help you with anything?

185
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.291
I'd love it if you could carry down
some of those boxes in the hallway.


186
00:27:18.359 --> 00:27:20.554
Sure. Where do you want them?

187
00:27:22.463 --> 00:27:24.590
Just put them in the cellar.

188
00:27:27.235 --> 00:27:28.429
Thanks.

189
00:27:36.778 --> 00:27:39.269
Oh, God. You got to stop that.

190
00:27:39.347 --> 00:27:41.474
Sorry if I surprised you.

191
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:43.039
What do you want?

192
00:27:43.117 --> 00:27:45.551
I wondered if you'd had a chance to look
at that purchase offer yet.


193
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.214
We're gonna make a go of it.

194
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:49.779
We're staying.

195
00:27:50.658 --> 00:27:53.650
Now, if you don't mind, 
I've got work to do.

196
00:27:55.563 --> 00:27:57.360
Of course.

197
00:27:57.966 --> 00:28:00.992
Always lots of work
to do around a farm.

198
00:28:01.069 --> 00:28:02.297
Bye now.

199
00:29:15.209 --> 00:29:16.471
Damn it!

200
00:29:21.215 --> 00:29:22.807
Get out of here!

201
00:29:25.653 --> 00:29:26.745
Shit.

202
00:31:30.211 --> 00:31:31.542
Oh, my God.

203
00:31:57.872 --> 00:32:00.773
About the only thing that keeps them away.

204
00:32:00.842 --> 00:32:02.673
They always like that?

205
00:32:02.743 --> 00:32:05.337
No. Hell, they just want your seeds.

206
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.073
- Roy Solomon.
- John Burwell.


207
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:11.277
Good to meet you.
Lucky you came by when you did.


208
00:32:11.352 --> 00:32:14.480
- You live around here?
- No, I was just heading into town.


209
00:32:14.555 --> 00:32:16.455
Got to go where the work is.

210
00:32:16.524 --> 00:32:18.253
What do you do?

211
00:32:18.326 --> 00:32:21.022
A little bit of everything. Why, you...

212
00:32:22.964 --> 00:32:25.558
You need some help around here?

213
00:32:25.633 --> 00:32:28.625
What was that noise? 
What's going on?

214
00:32:28.703 --> 00:32:31.103
Everything's all right.

215
00:32:31.172 --> 00:32:34.608
This is John Burwell,
part-time crow exterminator.


216
00:32:34.675 --> 00:32:37.769
The crows were going nuts out here.
If John hadn't come along when he did,


217
00:32:37.845 --> 00:32:39.813
I might have gotten pecked to death.

218
00:32:39.881 --> 00:32:41.940
Well, it's a good thing he did then.

219
00:32:42.016 --> 00:32:46.953
I could sure use somebody to help me in the
fields, but I really can't pay you till harvest.


220
00:32:47.021 --> 00:32:51.458
We could provide meals and put you up
in the workers' quarters till then.


221
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.125
Sunflowers, huh?

222
00:32:54.962 --> 00:32:56.554
All you can eat.

223
00:32:57.532 --> 00:32:59.193
That sounds good to me.

224
00:33:00.168 --> 00:33:03.467
Well, I was making some lunch.
Would you like to join us?


225
00:33:03.538 --> 00:33:05.870
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.


226
00:33:10.711 --> 00:33:13.509
Do you mind keeping that outside?

227
00:33:13.581 --> 00:33:15.048
Sorry.

228
00:33:23.624 --> 00:33:25.819
Got any family out here, John?

229
00:33:26.694 --> 00:33:28.423
No, ma'am. Just me.

230
00:33:33.267 --> 00:33:35.394
Think it's going to be a good harvest?

231
00:33:35.469 --> 00:33:40.133
Well, it's been a while since
that land's been planted, so, yeah.


232
00:33:41.576 --> 00:33:43.771
That's what I like to hear.

233
00:33:43.844 --> 00:33:45.038
Cheers.

234
00:33:47.715 --> 00:33:50.809
Hey, Jess.
Do you mind helping me with these?


235
00:33:50.885 --> 00:33:51.977
Yeah.

236
00:33:53.354 --> 00:33:54.548
Thanks.

237
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.650
You want this?

238
00:34:03.731 --> 00:34:05.255
He won't stop.

239
00:34:05.333 --> 00:34:07.563
But it must mean he likes you.

240
00:34:10.004 --> 00:34:12.165
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

241
00:35:02.189 --> 00:35:04.123
What are you looking for?

242
00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:05.419
Nothing.

243
00:35:06.027 --> 00:35:07.085
Roy?

244
00:35:08.095 --> 00:35:09.562
What's wrong?

245
00:35:10.498 --> 00:35:12.056
Oh, my God!

246
00:35:12.133 --> 00:35:13.725
Are you okay?

247
00:35:13.801 --> 00:35:15.996
- What happened?
- It's no big deal.


248
00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.265
I cut my hand on the tractor.

249
00:35:18.906 --> 00:35:20.771
Oh, honey, you're gonna need stitches.

250
00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:22.240
No, I just need a bandage.

251
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.800
No, we got to
get you to the hospital.

252
00:35:23.878 --> 00:35:25.675
Well, I can take him.

253
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.076
Not with a suspended license, you can't.

254
00:35:29.183 --> 00:35:31.708
All right. I'm going to get Ben's bag.
Jess, you get in the car.


255
00:35:31.786 --> 00:35:33.913
Ben can stay here with Jess.

256
00:35:35.022 --> 00:35:36.819
Roy, I don't think it's a good idea.

257
00:35:36.891 --> 00:35:39.451
Just grab the keys and let's go.
Jess and Ben will be fine.


258
00:35:39.527 --> 00:35:42.360
John's right outside if they need anything.

259
00:35:59.513 --> 00:36:00.844
Holy shit.

260
00:36:05.486 --> 00:36:06.885
Your dad gonna be all right?

261
00:36:06.954 --> 00:36:09.548
Yeah. He probably just needs some stitches.

262
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:14.390
Hey, what you got there? Farmer?

263
00:36:15.229 --> 00:36:19.097
You gonna be a farmer when you grow up,
like your daddy, huh?


264
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:22.294
- Let me know if you need anything, okay?
- Yeah, thanks.


265
00:36:26.374 --> 00:36:28.365
What's up with the crows?

266
00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.483
All right, Ben. 
Tonight we have

267
00:36:43.557 --> 00:36:46.424
filet mignon, veal parmesan,

268
00:36:46.494 --> 00:36:50.362
baked Alaska, chicken cacciatore,

269
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:52.626
and mac and cheese.

270
00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:04.907
Stay here, Ben, okay?

271
00:37:10.751 --> 00:37:11.809
Hey.

272
00:37:13.587 --> 00:37:14.679
John.

273
00:37:17.158 --> 00:37:18.557
Is that you?

274
00:37:28.269 --> 00:37:29.861
Hey, who is...

275
00:38:03.103 --> 00:38:04.968
911. What's your emergency?

276
00:38:05.039 --> 00:38:08.099
I think there's something in my house!

277
00:38:08.175 --> 00:38:11.144
I need you to get everybody
out of the house as quickly as possible.


278
00:38:11.212 --> 00:38:14.511
We'll send a car immediately.
Ma'am, are you alone?


279
00:38:14.582 --> 00:38:16.174
No, I'm with... I'm with...

280
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:17.308
Ben!

281
00:38:29.563 --> 00:38:30.621
Ben!

282
00:38:47.581 --> 00:38:48.639
Ben?

283
00:38:58.526 --> 00:39:00.426
Ben, what are you...

284
00:39:02.263 --> 00:39:03.355
Ben!

285
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.513
Let me go!

286
00:39:43.437 --> 00:39:44.995
What's wrong?

287
00:39:45.372 --> 00:39:48.398
Help us! Take him. Take him.

288
00:39:48.475 --> 00:39:50.102
What's the matter?

289
00:39:52.313 --> 00:39:55.441
What is it? Jess. 
What's the matter?

290
00:40:04.458 --> 00:40:06.756
Oh, Roy, I hope they're okay.

291
00:40:16.403 --> 00:40:19.463
- What happened?
- Everything's all right, ma'am.


292
00:40:21.075 --> 00:40:22.508
Oh, God.

293
00:40:27.681 --> 00:40:31.117
I already checked all the rooms.
There's nobody here.


294
00:40:31.185 --> 00:40:33.415
But she described a lot of damage.

295
00:40:34.722 --> 00:40:39.489
As of now, we're going to classify this
as a false alarm, not a deliberate hoax.


296
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.961
Thank you.

297
00:40:49.236 --> 00:40:50.225
What did John say?

298
00:40:50.304 --> 00:40:53.137
Well, he said it was easy to understand
someone getting scared


299
00:40:53.207 --> 00:40:55.607
their first night alone out here.

300
00:40:58.045 --> 00:41:00.411
But that he didn't see anything unusual
in the house.


301
00:41:00.481 --> 00:41:05.009
Mom, please believe me.
I'm not making this up. I'm telling the truth.


302
00:41:05.085 --> 00:41:06.552
Jess, please.

303
00:41:08.155 --> 00:41:09.486
Just stop.

304
00:41:14.762 --> 00:41:15.820
Dad...

305
00:41:18.365 --> 00:41:21.266
Dad, I'm really scared.
Can we just go home?


306
00:41:22.136 --> 00:41:25.469
Jessica, this is home.

307
00:41:26.607 --> 00:41:28.802
You need to get used to that.

308
00:41:31.011 --> 00:41:34.276
But I thought we agreed that
you were going to try.


309
00:41:37.418 --> 00:41:39.283
What happened to that?

310
00:42:12.786 --> 00:42:14.913
Hi. Shut the door.

311
00:42:19.259 --> 00:42:22.353
Maybe we shouldn't have
left Ben alone with her.


312
00:42:23.063 --> 00:42:27.124
Did you see her face?
She seemed so scared.


313
00:42:30.104 --> 00:42:32.732
I'm really worried about her.

314
00:42:32.806 --> 00:42:36.105
She's just having a hard time adjusting,
that's all.


315
00:42:37.544 --> 00:42:40.138
Being out here will be great for her.

316
00:42:41.915 --> 00:42:43.382
I don't know.

317
00:42:44.685 --> 00:42:48.485
- Maybe we're in over our heads here, Roy.
- We'll get through this.


318
00:42:48.555 --> 00:42:50.955
Just give her some time. 
She'll be fine.

319
00:43:00.801 --> 00:43:02.894
You saw it too, didn't you?

320
00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.670
Come on. I know you did. 
You had to have.

321
00:43:10.644 --> 00:43:12.703
Just tell me.

322
00:43:16.383 --> 00:43:19.284
I wish you could just tell them
what you saw.


323
00:43:20.521 --> 00:43:23.718
Come on, Ben.
When are you going to start talking?


324
00:43:31.265 --> 00:43:34.359
I promise I'll never let anything
happen to you.


325
00:43:36.003 --> 00:43:37.334
I promise.

326
00:44:00.961 --> 00:44:03.395
You heard that, too, didn't you?

327
00:44:04.798 --> 00:44:06.425
Can you see them?

328
00:44:15.142 --> 00:44:17.007
Where are they, Ben?

329
00:48:13.013 --> 00:48:14.537
Son of a bitch!

330
00:48:21.588 --> 00:48:23.647
Hey, you didn't hear that.

331
00:48:23.723 --> 00:48:26.453
- Dad said you needed this.
- Yeah, thanks.


332
00:48:28.462 --> 00:48:32.262
Why did you tell my parents
you didn't see anything last night?


333
00:48:32.933 --> 00:48:34.833
Well, because I didn't.

334
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:39.966
I mean, look, I know you were scared.

335
00:48:40.841 --> 00:48:46.336
And I know that people,
even your parents, sometimes,


336
00:48:46.413 --> 00:48:49.576
- they don't know how to listen.
- Especially my parents.


337
00:48:49.649 --> 00:48:54.052
They got pressures
that you can't even begin to understand.


338
00:48:58.158 --> 00:49:00.854
You sure you saw something up there?

339
00:49:00.927 --> 00:49:04.124
I saw it. It was real.

340
00:49:05.565 --> 00:49:08.295
Maybe you've just got
a lot on your mind.

341
00:49:21.348 --> 00:49:23.179
Hey, Jess.

342
00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.480
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.


343
00:49:27.654 --> 00:49:30.088
You don't look so good. What's up?

344
00:49:32.192 --> 00:49:34.683
Did you know the family
that used to live in my house?


345
00:49:34.761 --> 00:49:37.161
Not really. It was
the Rollins that lived there.

346
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:38.424
What happened to them?

347
00:49:38.498 --> 00:49:41.831
They just up and left
about five, six years ago.


348
00:49:41.902 --> 00:49:45.599
There were some bad harvests.
Lot of people didn't make it.


349
00:49:47.841 --> 00:49:49.001
Hey...

350
00:49:50.644 --> 00:49:55.741
Did you ever hear of anything
about my house being, like, haunted?


351
00:50:00.287 --> 00:50:01.618
Seriously.

352
00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:05.282
Just, like, stupid stories.
It's been abandoned for a long time. So...


353
00:50:05.358 --> 00:50:07.986
- What kind of stories?
- Nothing really.


354
00:50:09.129 --> 00:50:13.691
When we were kids, we used to dare
each other to go down into the cellar.


355
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:17.099
Why? Did you ever see anything?

356
00:50:18.538 --> 00:50:19.903
No. Not me.

357
00:50:22.142 --> 00:50:24.110
I never went down there.

358
00:53:28.461 --> 00:53:30.088
What's happening to me?

359
00:53:53.787 --> 00:53:55.254
Are you okay?

360
00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.817
I saw something again today.

361
00:54:01.628 --> 00:54:05.086
It's a girl. She was in the cellar.
Something...


362
00:54:06.933 --> 00:54:09.128
Something happened to her.

363
00:54:12.539 --> 00:54:15.372
She was trying to get away from something.

364
00:54:16.009 --> 00:54:18.443
- Get away from what?
- I don't know.


365
00:54:19.112 --> 00:54:20.739
But she was...

366
00:54:20.814 --> 00:54:24.147
She looked just scared to death.

367
00:54:31.324 --> 00:54:33.189
Have you told your folks about this?

368
00:54:33.259 --> 00:54:35.693
You know my parents already think I'm nuts.

369
00:54:38.832 --> 00:54:40.800
Do you think it's crazy?

370
00:54:42.469 --> 00:54:44.130
People's spirits

371
00:54:45.305 --> 00:54:47.796
hanging around after they're dead?

372
00:54:49.843 --> 00:54:51.105
No.

373
00:54:52.212 --> 00:54:55.875
There's something about the land out here.

374
00:54:55.949 --> 00:54:59.715
It gets ahold of people.
It doesn't want to let them go.


375
00:55:07.994 --> 00:55:10.986
What about you?
Don't you get lonely out here?


376
00:55:12.131 --> 00:55:14.725
Don't you miss having
a family of your own?

377
00:55:14.801 --> 00:55:17.497
Nah, you guys keep me plenty busy.

378
00:55:25.612 --> 00:55:28.706
Thank you. For listening.

379
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.278
Anytime.

380
00:55:50.036 --> 00:55:53.335
- Almost ready.
- Yes! That's what I'm talking about.


381
00:55:57.677 --> 00:55:59.736
I really like being here, Roy.

382
00:55:59.812 --> 00:56:03.009
You guys make me feel like family.
I'm grateful.


383
00:56:03.082 --> 00:56:05.050
Lucky to have you, John.

384
00:56:05.785 --> 00:56:10.119
Let's see how good the harvest is,
and maybe I can afford to keep you on.


385
00:56:10.189 --> 00:56:13.716
Don't worry about me.
You just take care of your family.


386
00:57:41.914 --> 00:57:43.609
Help me.

387
00:58:06.239 --> 00:58:07.399
Hello?

388
00:58:19.452 --> 00:58:21.443
What do you want from me?

389
00:59:16.075 --> 00:59:17.133
Hey.

390
00:59:22.882 --> 00:59:24.144
You okay?

391
00:59:29.889 --> 00:59:31.481
Can you hear me?

392
00:59:42.502 --> 00:59:43.969
What's wrong?

393
01:00:18.337 --> 01:00:19.565
Is she okay?

394
01:00:19.639 --> 01:00:22.403
The lacerations are superficial.
So she'll be just fine.


395
01:00:22.475 --> 01:00:24.067
Oh, thank God.

396
01:00:25.011 --> 01:00:26.638
Is there any reason...

397
01:00:26.712 --> 01:00:29.772
Has there been any trouble
in the family recently


398
01:00:29.849 --> 01:00:33.683
that would make her want to hurt
or draw attention to herself?


399
01:00:39.992 --> 01:00:42.324
We just moved here from Chicago.

400
01:00:43.196 --> 01:00:45.721
And back there,

401
01:00:45.798 --> 01:00:49.495
Jess got into some trouble.

402
01:00:51.637 --> 01:00:53.867
She's kind of struggled a bit.

403
01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.438
We've been dealing with
a lot of emotional issues.


404
01:01:12.058 --> 01:01:14.049
Jessica? Your mom's here.

405
01:01:15.328 --> 01:01:16.386
Hey.

406
01:01:28.741 --> 01:01:31.369
Dad, we need to leave the house now,

407
01:01:31.444 --> 01:01:33.639
before anything else happens.

408
01:01:35.681 --> 01:01:36.739
Dad.

409
01:01:38.551 --> 01:01:40.109
Dad, I'm really scared.

410
01:01:40.186 --> 01:01:43.917
Have you forgotten how hard it was
the last couple of years?


411
01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:47.423
Me out of work, 
Ben's hospital bills.

412
01:01:47.493 --> 01:01:50.485
We went through every dime
your mother and I managed to save.


413
01:01:50.563 --> 01:01:55.057
Twenty years.
Twenty years of savings gone in two years.


414
01:01:57.203 --> 01:02:00.934
We have everything
riding on this harvest, Jess. Everything.


415
01:02:02.575 --> 01:02:05.305
We're only a couple of days away. Please.

416
01:02:09.515 --> 01:02:12.211
- Mom, these things attacked me.
- Enough!


417
01:02:20.893 --> 01:02:25.159
God. The doctor said
your cuts look self-inflicted.


418
01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:27.927
That's what he said. 
That you did this!

419
01:02:30.536 --> 01:02:33.471
You actually think that I would do this
to myself?


420
01:02:36.609 --> 01:02:38.600
Why won't you believe me?

421
01:02:39.345 --> 01:02:40.972
How can we, Jess?

422
01:02:43.816 --> 01:02:45.044
Tell me!

423
01:02:46.819 --> 01:02:49.515
I mean,
we thought you put this all behind you.


424
01:02:58.431 --> 01:03:01.161
Why do you keep
blaming everything on me?


425
01:03:02.068 --> 01:03:03.968
You never listen to me.

426
01:03:05.237 --> 01:03:09.333
And what? We're supposed to pretend like
we're some big happy family again?


427
01:03:09.775 --> 01:03:11.367
I can't do that.

428
01:03:14.246 --> 01:03:15.338
Jess!

429
01:03:18.784 --> 01:03:20.149
Let her go.

430
01:03:54.587 --> 01:03:56.919
Maybe coming here was a mistake.

431
01:03:57.723 --> 01:03:59.816
Don't second-guess yourself, Roy.

432
01:03:59.892 --> 01:04:03.555
Why not? Everybody else around here does.

433
01:04:03.629 --> 01:04:05.654
Don't attack me over this.

434
01:04:07.199 --> 01:04:08.928
I should have sold.

435
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:13.636
- Damn it.
- What?


436
01:04:20.413 --> 01:04:24.247
Right after we got here,
there was another offer on the place.


437
01:04:26.352 --> 01:04:29.617
We would have made our money back,
plus another 15%.


438
01:04:36.595 --> 01:04:39.462
And you didn't even mention this to me?

439
01:04:39.532 --> 01:04:43.059
How could I?
You would have taken the offer on the spot.


440
01:04:43.869 --> 01:04:47.032
So you make this decision
without even telling me?


441
01:04:47.106 --> 01:04:50.906
I held this family together for two years
while you were looking for a job.


442
01:04:50.976 --> 01:04:55.913
And then I come all the way out here
when you decided this was the answer.


443
01:04:55.981 --> 01:04:59.815
And now we had another option
and you didn't even tell me about it?


444
01:04:59.885 --> 01:05:02.115
You held this family together?

445
01:05:02.922 --> 01:05:06.449
Is that why you and Jess can't even be in
the same room for more than five minutes?


446
01:05:06.525 --> 01:05:08.652
No wonder the girl's a mess.

447
01:05:12.465 --> 01:05:15.901
Damn, Denise. Denise, I'm sorry.

448
01:05:19.071 --> 01:05:20.299
Damn it.

449
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:39.282
Damn.

450
01:05:44.563 --> 01:05:46.053
Everything okay, Roy?

451
01:05:46.132 --> 01:05:49.590
No matter what I do,
I can't keep this family together.


452
01:06:10.322 --> 01:06:12.051
Hey. You all right?

453
01:06:13.159 --> 01:06:14.888
Do you want a ride?

454
01:06:18.364 --> 01:06:20.332
So where are we going?

455
01:06:20.399 --> 01:06:22.560
Feed store.

456
01:06:22.635 --> 01:06:23.727
Why?

457
01:06:28.107 --> 01:06:30.041
Bobby, I'm gonna tell you something.

458
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:34.045
And I need you to believe me,
because nobody else does.


459
01:06:34.113 --> 01:06:35.171
Okay.

460
01:06:35.247 --> 01:06:37.545
I don't think the
Rollins just up and left.

461
01:06:37.616 --> 01:06:40.016
What are you talking about, Jess?

462
01:06:40.452 --> 01:06:42.545
I think something really terrible
happened to them.


463
01:06:42.621 --> 01:06:45.215
I think they're dead. 
I've seen them.

464
01:06:46.525 --> 01:06:48.254
You've seen ghosts?

465
01:06:55.401 --> 01:06:59.337
- Have you talked to your parents?
- I've tried but they won't listen to me.


466
01:06:59.405 --> 01:07:00.463
Why?

467
01:07:02.007 --> 01:07:04.908
Back in Chicago, I messed up.

468
01:07:09.682 --> 01:07:14.244
Like, six months ago, my mom was picking
up my dad from the airport.


469
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.154
And his flight was late,
so she called to see if I could


470
01:07:18.224 --> 01:07:21.921
pick up my little brother
from the babysitter's house.


471
01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:27.022
And I should have told her
that I'd been drinking with my friends but...


472
01:07:27.099 --> 01:07:29.727
I mean, it wasn't like
I was wasted or anything,


473
01:07:29.802 --> 01:07:31.201
and I thought I was okay to drive.

474
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:36.833
But we got in a wreck,
and Ben had to go to the hospital.


475
01:07:38.544 --> 01:07:40.876
And he hasn't talked since then.

476
01:07:43.415 --> 01:07:47.283
I mean, they just
haven't let it go yet.

477
01:07:50.022 --> 01:07:52.422
Everybody makes mistakes, Jess.

478
01:07:58.664 --> 01:07:59.756
Yeah.

479
01:08:00.266 --> 01:08:02.564
Your sister's going to be okay.

480
01:08:03.102 --> 01:08:04.569
Right, Benny?

481
01:08:06.672 --> 01:08:08.401
Say, "Right, Mama."

482
01:08:21.053 --> 01:08:23.283
What are you pointing at, Ben?

483
01:08:25.557 --> 01:08:27.525
What do you see?

484
01:08:29.194 --> 01:08:31.094
What does it look like?

485
01:09:05.364 --> 01:09:06.854
What the hell?

486
01:09:52.411 --> 01:09:55.312
Okay, honey.
Lie down for your nap, sweetie.


487
01:09:56.415 --> 01:09:58.576
You okay? All right.

488
01:11:00.245 --> 01:11:03.544
The woman in this watch,
I remember seeing her here.


489
01:11:06.318 --> 01:11:07.478
There!

490
01:11:10.255 --> 01:11:11.620
That's her.

491
01:11:16.795 --> 01:11:18.057
Oh, my God.

492
01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:20.360
- What is it?
- I got to get home.


493
01:11:24.603 --> 01:11:27.697
Ben, honey. We got
to get out of here.

494
01:11:29.641 --> 01:11:31.632
Honey, come on.

495
01:12:15.654 --> 01:12:18.919
Mama will be right there.
Mama will be right there.


496
01:12:20.192 --> 01:12:22.888
All right. Stay right there. 
All right, okay.

497
01:12:22.961 --> 01:12:26.397
Mama will be right there.
You stay right there.


498
01:12:27.165 --> 01:12:28.826
Oh, my God, John.

499
01:12:29.701 --> 01:12:31.464
Where are you going?

500
01:12:33.305 --> 01:12:35.432
Where are you going, Mary?

501
01:12:37.309 --> 01:12:38.401
What?

502
01:12:41.246 --> 01:12:42.713
What is this?

503
01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:46.779
Are you leaving me?

504
01:12:47.619 --> 01:12:49.849
- I don't...
- Shut up!


505
01:12:49.988 --> 01:12:51.888
No, don't...

506
01:12:53.292 --> 01:12:56.125
I've been working my ass off every day.

507
01:12:56.695 --> 01:12:59.425
- It's never good enough for you, is it?
- Oh, God.


508
01:13:01.233 --> 01:13:05.067
Did you really think
that I could ever let you leave me?


509
01:13:13.845 --> 01:13:15.107
Michael.

510
01:13:24.089 --> 01:13:26.717
Open this door! Open this door, Mary!

511
01:13:38.236 --> 01:13:39.294
Mom?

512
01:13:43.275 --> 01:13:44.333
Dad?

513
01:13:56.188 --> 01:13:57.246
Mom?

514
01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:09.958
Mom?

515
01:14:11.503 --> 01:14:12.561
Ben?

516
01:14:49.374 --> 01:14:50.398
Go!

517
01:15:06.258 --> 01:15:07.885
Bobby, wait!

518
01:15:07.959 --> 01:15:09.221
- What?
- My brother.


519
01:15:09.294 --> 01:15:12.661
- He's not here. Let's go.
- Bobby, watch out!


520
01:15:22.274 --> 01:15:24.765
Open the door!

521
01:15:37.255 --> 01:15:38.313
Mom?

522
01:15:55.807 --> 01:15:56.865
Mom.

523
01:15:57.275 --> 01:15:58.537
Oh, Jess.

524
01:15:59.978 --> 01:16:02.208
I know what you were seeing.

525
01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.807
I've seen it, too.
I'm so sorry I didn't trust you.


526
01:16:13.225 --> 01:16:15.250
Mom, I've got to find
a way out of here.

527
01:16:15.327 --> 01:16:16.726
- Okay?
- Okay.


528
01:16:20.365 --> 01:16:24.961
Mary. Do you think
I would let you walk out on this family?


529
01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.740
Open the door, Lindsay.

530
01:16:36.581 --> 01:16:38.276
Open the door!

531
01:17:13.351 --> 01:17:15.216
You're not leaving me.

532
01:18:23.555 --> 01:18:26.353
Be quiet, sweetheart. Be quiet.

533
01:18:38.303 --> 01:18:40.567
Bobby? Bobby!

534
01:18:46.645 --> 01:18:49.239
Where are they, Bobby? 
Where are they?

535
01:19:03.929 --> 01:19:05.123
Denise?

536
01:19:06.798 --> 01:19:09.426
- Dad?
- Jess.


537
01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:10.593
Dad!

538
01:19:14.005 --> 01:19:16.439
You've been a bad girl, Lindsay.

539
01:19:22.981 --> 01:19:25.142
No! Leave her alone!

540
01:19:29.821 --> 01:19:31.311
Come here!

541
01:19:33.391 --> 01:19:36.952
Why are you always trying to run away
from me, Lindsay?


542
01:19:39.097 --> 01:19:41.224
What's the matter with you?

543
01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.432
Don't you like your family?

544
01:19:48.106 --> 01:19:51.041
My family is going to stick together!

545
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:01.578
We're not your family!

546
01:21:08.987 --> 01:21:10.181
Mom?

547
01:21:18.363 --> 01:21:19.421
Dad!

548
01:21:24.202 --> 01:21:25.430
I got you.

549
01:21:41.719 --> 01:21:42.947
Hold on!

550
01:22:31.236 --> 01:22:32.999
Hey, honey, it's me.

551
01:22:34.906 --> 01:22:36.999
It's gonna be all right.

552
01:22:38.676 --> 01:22:41.736
Mrs. Solomon,
I have just a few more questions.


553
01:22:57.529 --> 01:22:59.326
You're gonna be okay.

554
01:23:22.987 --> 01:23:24.648
Excuse us, please.

555
01:23:25.123 --> 01:23:26.454
Let's get him in.

556
01:23:55.787 --> 01:23:57.982
Maybe now they can rest, Ben.

557
01:24:07.599 --> 01:24:09.567
- Hey.
- Hey.


558
01:24:09.634 --> 01:24:12.467
- You thirsty?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.


559
01:24:18.576 --> 01:24:20.373
So, how's it going?

560
01:24:21.746 --> 01:24:23.236
Getting there.

561
01:24:24.949 --> 01:24:27.543
What's up there, dude? 
What's in the sky?

562
01:24:27.619 --> 01:24:30.349
- That. Birdie.
- What's that?


563
01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:36.556
- Is that a cloud?
- Crow. That's a crow.


564
01:24:41.833 --> 01:24:43.357
How about that?

565
01:30:25.193 --> 01:30:26.357
