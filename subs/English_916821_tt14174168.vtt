1
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.668
You got sad eyes.

2
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:24.840
Not my usual pick-up line, but...

3
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:30.721
I just sensed you are a man
running from shadows.


4
00:04:35.017 --> 00:04:36.768
What's your usual pick-up line?

5
00:04:38.228 --> 00:04:41.857
When I see a guy
alone at the bar


6
00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:44.067
at 3:00 in the morning,

7
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:49.406
I lean in real close
and whisper in his ear:


8
00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.077
"For 510 bucks,
we can spend an hour.


9
00:04:54.453 --> 00:04:57.247
For 1,000,
we can spend a night."


10
00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:00.542
Why 510?

11
00:05:02.586 --> 00:05:07.049
'Cause the ATM
only spits out 20s.


12
00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:11.470
I've never had a john ask me
to break a note.


13
00:05:13.806 --> 00:05:15.641
That's actually smart.

14
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:21.730
So?

15
00:06:33.844 --> 00:06:35.137
See that?

16
00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:47.941
Gasoline Alley...

17
00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:49.401
Jimmy Jayne.

18
00:07:31.443 --> 00:07:32.986
You sure about this?

19
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.780
I'm sure, I'm sure.

20
00:07:37.115 --> 00:07:38.115
Okay.

21
00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:50.003
Okay.

22
00:07:52.422 --> 00:07:53.465
Who's Shelby?

23
00:07:54.383 --> 00:07:56.093
She rocks my world.

24
00:07:56.468 --> 00:07:57.845
You're a lucky gal.

25
00:07:58.762 --> 00:07:59.888
Yeah, we both are.

26
00:07:59.972 --> 00:08:01.223
Right there?

27
00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:05.184
Hold on.

28
00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:13.026
James Jayne?

29
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.486
Yeah.

30
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.405
That's what it says
on my license.


31
00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:19.575
Detective Freeman.

32
00:08:19.908 --> 00:08:21.577
This is Detective Vargas.

33
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:22.869
Hi.

34
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:24.037
Okay.

35
00:08:24.538 --> 00:08:27.416
Yeah, your old man
was on the force, wasn't he?


36
00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:29.084
14th precinct.

37
00:08:29.168 --> 00:08:31.753
Hmm, how's he doing?

38
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:35.174
I don't think
he's doing much of anything.


39
00:08:35.257 --> 00:08:37.926
Spends his days
at the Fitzgerald Cemetery.


40
00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:39.011
He was a good cop.

41
00:08:39.094 --> 00:08:40.429
Damn good cop.

42
00:08:40.512 --> 00:08:42.222
Always paid his tab.

43
00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:45.350
Did you ever consider the force?

44
00:08:45.434 --> 00:08:47.186
Yeah. You ever think about it?

45
00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:49.521
No, never.

46
00:08:55.486 --> 00:08:57.446
That's yours, right?

47
00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:00.073
I mean, it's my shop's lighter.

48
00:09:00.157 --> 00:09:01.158
Right.

49
00:09:01.867 --> 00:09:05.078
James... sorry,
may I call you, "James"?


50
00:09:05.162 --> 00:09:07.915
The reason that we're here
is we need to talk to you


51
00:09:07.998 --> 00:09:09.708
about the four dead girls.

52
00:09:09.792 --> 00:09:10.918
Okay?

53
00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:12.795
What's that have to do with me?

54
00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:16.173
The lighter,
it was found at the crime scene.


55
00:09:16.256 --> 00:09:17.549
What's your point?

56
00:09:18.717 --> 00:09:20.385
What was it doing there?

57
00:09:20.469 --> 00:09:22.149
I don't know what it's fucking
doing there.


58
00:09:22.221 --> 00:09:25.224
I once found my lighter floating
in a urinal at a Duke's.


59
00:09:27.518 --> 00:09:28.602
Am I a suspect?

60
00:09:28.685 --> 00:09:29.871
You were seen
with one of the victims


61
00:09:29.895 --> 00:09:30.979
at Rocka's, okay.

62
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.481
Thing about Rocka's,

63
00:09:32.564 --> 00:09:34.107
it's over on the other side
of town


64
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:35.734
and there are 100
good watering holes


65
00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:37.045
in between here and there,
right?


66
00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:38.069
Yeah.

67
00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.155
Yeah, again, again,
what's your point?


68
00:09:40.239 --> 00:09:43.909
My point is why drive
all the way over there


69
00:09:43.992 --> 00:09:46.453
like I was saying,
it's a long ways away.


70
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.914
Sentimental reasons.

71
00:09:48.997 --> 00:09:50.582
Such as?

72
00:09:52.626 --> 00:09:54.211
My mother used to work there.

73
00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:57.005
Okay. Behind the bar?

74
00:09:57.089 --> 00:09:58.465
No, not behind the bar.

75
00:09:58.549 --> 00:09:59.758
Oh.

76
00:10:00.092 --> 00:10:02.177
Uh, Jimmy, excuse my partner.

77
00:10:02.553 --> 00:10:06.098
He still doesn't know what side
of the bed to wake up on.


78
00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:07.057
He's right.

79
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:08.475
We have some photos,

80
00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:11.562
maybe you could uh, ID
some of the victims.


81
00:10:11.645 --> 00:10:12.729
That'd be helpful.

82
00:10:12.855 --> 00:10:14.648
Holy shit,
you don't even know their names.


83
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:17.901
James, we're gonna need to talk
to you in private, okay?


84
00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:19.403
The sooner, the better.

85
00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:22.289
All right, give me an hour.
I got a customer.


86
00:10:22.406 --> 00:10:24.283
No, we need to talk to you
right now,


87
00:10:24.408 --> 00:10:26.827
so the tramp stamp
will have to wait.


88
00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:28.454
How you doin', darlin'?

89
00:10:28.537 --> 00:10:30.205
What you gonna get, a unicorn?

90
00:10:44.428 --> 00:10:46.180
I hope you can be discrete.

91
00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:51.393
Last thing we need
is a media circus.


92
00:10:51.477 --> 00:10:54.438
Yeah, he's right,
'cause if that happens,


93
00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:56.857
then the D.A.,
he puts pressure on us


94
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.943
to pin it on some poor schmuck.

95
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.488
All right. I'll go ahead
and get started, right, boss?


96
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:04.156
- Yes.
- Okay.


97
00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:07.868
For the record,
I'm Detective Vargas.


98
00:11:08.327 --> 00:11:09.661
That's Detective Freeman.

99
00:11:09.745 --> 00:11:11.205
And we're conducting
an interview


100
00:11:11.288 --> 00:11:17.211
with Mr. James Jayne
concerning case V-7-7-4-3.


101
00:11:17.294 --> 00:11:18.796
They suffer?

102
00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:20.130
What do you think?

103
00:11:20.214 --> 00:11:21.649
I think it's a fair
fucking question,


104
00:11:21.673 --> 00:11:22.800
that's what I think.

105
00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:25.093
Yeah, they suffered.

106
00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:28.806
I imagine you already questioned

107
00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:30.599
the guests, staff?

108
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:33.268
Since 5:00 a.m. this morning.

109
00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:35.312
63 rooms.

110
00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.564
Yeah, nobody suspicious.

111
00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:41.610
Nobody caught our attention,
except you.


112
00:11:43.612 --> 00:11:44.822
Security cameras?

113
00:11:46.114 --> 00:11:47.514
They didn't have any
at the rat trap


114
00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:48.492
they found 'em at,

115
00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:50.744
but they're on camera
leaving the bar.


116
00:11:50.828 --> 00:11:53.205
Then you're on camera
a few seconds later


117
00:11:53.288 --> 00:11:55.415
following 'em out the door.

118
00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:57.501
I had a drink, and I left.

119
00:11:57.584 --> 00:11:58.585
What time?

120
00:11:59.044 --> 00:12:01.046
2:30. Give or take.

121
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.923
Talk to anybody
while you were there?


122
00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:05.300
Yeah.

123
00:12:05.384 --> 00:12:06.677
What were you doing there?

124
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.345
I was fucking guys.

125
00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:10.514
- Easy.
- It's just juries,


126
00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:13.684
they don't look real favorably
on uncooperative witnesses.


127
00:12:14.017 --> 00:12:16.103
- Right?
- Right.


128
00:12:16.478 --> 00:12:17.997
Look, why don't you just
show me the pictures?


129
00:12:18.021 --> 00:12:19.541
'Cause something tells me
somebody told you


130
00:12:19.565 --> 00:12:21.108
I was with the girls that night.

131
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.693
You want to see the pictures?

132
00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:24.695
Sure,
we'll show you the pictures.


133
00:12:26.989 --> 00:12:28.574
Pretty sordid.

134
00:12:29.241 --> 00:12:31.702
Let me just start back
at the beginning here.


135
00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:33.245
Here we go.

136
00:12:33.328 --> 00:12:35.831
Huh, pretty gnarly, right?

137
00:12:36.165 --> 00:12:37.165
Gnarly?

138
00:12:37.207 --> 00:12:38.876
Recognize any of them?

139
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:44.923
Boom, boom, boom,
what you think?


140
00:12:46.216 --> 00:12:47.216
That's pretty bad.

141
00:12:47.259 --> 00:12:48.427
Go back.

142
00:12:50.721 --> 00:12:52.681
- That's Star.
- Huh.


143
00:12:52.764 --> 00:12:54.766
That's what she told me
her name was.


144
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.810
You ever seen
these girls before?


145
00:12:58.187 --> 00:12:59.813
Not before last night.

146
00:12:59.897 --> 00:13:03.066
You talked to Star, what about?

147
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.943
- Business.
- What?


148
00:13:05.027 --> 00:13:07.362
- Business.
- Tattoos or movies?


149
00:13:07.488 --> 00:13:08.864
She was an actor.

150
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.824
Aspiring actor.

151
00:13:12.075 --> 00:13:13.368
Am I the only suspect?

152
00:13:13.452 --> 00:13:15.329
Person of interest.

153
00:13:15.412 --> 00:13:19.458
So Star, I'm assuming
she was a working girl.


154
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:20.834
Yeah.

155
00:13:20.918 --> 00:13:22.753
Did she make you an offer?

156
00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:25.380
Of course she did.

157
00:13:25.464 --> 00:13:26.715
Did you take her up on it?

158
00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:28.109
Or did you try and bargain
with her?


159
00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:30.010
Maybe when you tried
to bargain with her,


160
00:13:30.219 --> 00:13:32.179
you kind of made her feel
a little cheap...


161
00:13:32.262 --> 00:13:33.138
Fucking what?

162
00:13:33.222 --> 00:13:34.973
Then she said
something nasty, who knows?


163
00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:36.910
Maybe that hurt your feelings,
and then you thought,


164
00:13:36.934 --> 00:13:37.952
"Hey, I'm really gonna let her have it."

165
00:13:37.976 --> 00:13:39.686
Double fucking talk.

166
00:13:40.062 --> 00:13:41.271
Did you hook up with her?

167
00:13:44.024 --> 00:13:46.109
No. I told her I was meeting
with somebody after.


168
00:13:46.193 --> 00:13:47.653
And who is that?

169
00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:50.113
This girl I run around with. Christine.

170
00:13:50.906 --> 00:13:52.157
- Okay.
- Are we done here?


171
00:13:52.241 --> 00:13:54.618
No. So I'm just trying to get
all this straight in my head,


172
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:56.179
- maybe you can help me, boss?
- Yeah.


173
00:13:56.203 --> 00:13:59.123
- So the bar, it closes at 2:30.
- Right.


174
00:13:59.206 --> 00:14:01.625
That gives you 45 minutes
to kill 'em.


175
00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:02.751
Stage 'em.

176
00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:06.213
Then mosey on over
to this Christine girl.


177
00:14:06.672 --> 00:14:09.049
And you asked,
"Did they suffer?"


178
00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:10.509
Their necks were broken.

179
00:14:10.592 --> 00:14:11.760
All four of 'em.

180
00:14:11.844 --> 00:14:13.846
Of course,
that's not real difficult.


181
00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:17.307
When you got poor helpless girls
all whacked out on


182
00:14:17.766 --> 00:14:20.727
junk and blow,
God knows what else.


183
00:14:20.811 --> 00:14:24.189
Now the only
suspect description we got


184
00:14:24.273 --> 00:14:27.276
is of a Caucasian shitkicker.

185
00:14:27.693 --> 00:14:29.361
You seen any of those lately?

186
00:14:31.697 --> 00:14:32.990
Get the fuck out of my shop.

187
00:14:33.073 --> 00:14:34.616
I actually think we're done here

188
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.869
and we probably don't need
to tell you this,


189
00:14:36.952 --> 00:14:40.414
but don't leave the country,
hell, don't leave the county.


190
00:14:40.497 --> 00:14:42.291
We can haul you in
on a Ramey warrant


191
00:14:42.374 --> 00:14:43.417
anytime, okay.

192
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.253
So yeah, you're still a suspect,
got it?


193
00:14:46.712 --> 00:14:48.797
Don't worry,
if you get found guilty,


194
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:51.383
we'll walk you down
to the electric chair ourselves.


195
00:14:51.467 --> 00:14:52.747
It's like that
old gospel number,


196
00:14:52.801 --> 00:14:54.219
You'll Never Walk Alone.

197
00:14:54.303 --> 00:14:55.220
Let's hit it, boss.

198
00:14:55.304 --> 00:14:56.597
Good talking to you.

199
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.312
Nice spot.

200
00:15:13.197 --> 00:15:14.490
Fuck!

201
00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:28.420
Christine.

202
00:15:29.087 --> 00:15:30.087
Hey.

203
00:15:31.924 --> 00:15:33.842
One sec, come here.

204
00:15:39.348 --> 00:15:40.682
You get my text?

205
00:15:42.017 --> 00:15:45.020
Cops calling on me at work
ain't a good look, Jimmy.


206
00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:48.583
They wanted to confirm you
were on your way to see me


207
00:15:48.607 --> 00:15:49.775
last night.

208
00:15:51.318 --> 00:15:52.736
What'd you say?

209
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.279
I told 'em, yeah.

210
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.574
The bald one,
he thought I'd be all bent


211
00:15:57.658 --> 00:16:00.244
about you flirting
with those poor girls.


212
00:16:00.577 --> 00:16:03.997
I told 'em, nah,
it ain't like that.


213
00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:08.377
He flirts with everybody,
that's what makes him Jimmy.


214
00:16:09.503 --> 00:16:10.838
Attagirl.

215
00:16:10.921 --> 00:16:12.422
The other one,

216
00:16:12.506 --> 00:16:15.843
he acts all best friends
bonding shit,


217
00:16:15.926 --> 00:16:18.554
wasn't shy about doing
a little flirting himself.


218
00:16:19.805 --> 00:16:21.140
Fuckin' asshole.

219
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.079
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

220
00:16:44.788 --> 00:16:46.039
Whoa, whoa.

221
00:16:46.123 --> 00:16:47.374
- Oh God.
- Whoa.


222
00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:49.793
- All right.

See me looking like a badass,
shooting these fucking guns.


280
00:21:22.274 --> 00:21:24.276
They should let me shoot
a real one, huh?


281
00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:26.403
Ain't gonna make the show
easier to watch.


282
00:21:27.905 --> 00:21:30.491
I know you didn't just come here
to bruise my ego.


283
00:21:30.824 --> 00:21:33.410
Rub your paycheck on it,
that'll make it feel better.


284
00:21:33.494 --> 00:21:34.745
Yeah, that's good.

285
00:21:35.537 --> 00:21:37.706
All right, Jimmy,
what's the favor?


286
00:21:38.957 --> 00:21:40.667
You're in the scene, right?

287
00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:42.753
I do okay. It's not really
your vibe though,


288
00:21:42.836 --> 00:21:43.996
if that's what you're asking.

289
00:21:45.547 --> 00:21:47.591
Don't use that tone of voice
with me.


290
00:21:48.342 --> 00:21:50.469
Remember who kept you safe
on the inside.


291
00:21:52.596 --> 00:21:53.639
Yeah, I know.

292
00:21:53.722 --> 00:21:55.408
You know how grateful I am that
you protected me


293
00:21:55.432 --> 00:21:56.433
when I was in there.

294
00:21:59.686 --> 00:22:01.122
I bet your friends think
you're tough


295
00:22:01.146 --> 00:22:04.691
doing three months hard time
for a fucking DUI or whatever.


296
00:22:06.652 --> 00:22:08.320
I wonder what they'd say
if they find out


297
00:22:08.403 --> 00:22:10.155
you cried yourself
to sleep every night


298
00:22:10.239 --> 00:22:12.533
worried Kratos from Cell Block E
was gonna make you


299
00:22:12.616 --> 00:22:14.284
his little fucking bitch.

300
00:22:14.368 --> 00:22:16.328
I'm grateful
that you fucked him up for me.


301
00:22:18.122 --> 00:22:19.456
How grateful?

302
00:22:22.042 --> 00:22:23.502
Anything for a friend, Jimmy.

303
00:22:24.711 --> 00:22:26.171
Got your kit?

304
00:22:26.255 --> 00:22:27.381
Yeah.

305
00:22:27.464 --> 00:22:28.382
Okay.

306
00:22:28.465 --> 00:22:30.259
Yeah, all right.
Come on.


307
00:22:38.392 --> 00:22:40.310
Heard they're already planning
a rip-off episode


308
00:22:40.394 --> 00:22:41.394
about the dead girls.

309
00:22:41.436 --> 00:22:42.646
Bullshit.

310
00:22:42.729 --> 00:22:43.939
I swear to God.

311
00:22:44.565 --> 00:22:46.984
The writer's PA with the fat ass
told me last night.


312
00:22:47.067 --> 00:22:48.277
That is tasteless.

313
00:22:49.611 --> 00:22:50.946
I knew one of 'em.

314
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:52.530
From where?

315
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.950
Some party.

316
00:22:55.492 --> 00:22:56.618
Whose?

317
00:22:57.953 --> 00:22:59.997
Persi Muleeney, something.

318
00:23:00.414 --> 00:23:02.374
Get the fuck outta here.
That's a made-up name.


319
00:23:02.458 --> 00:23:04.543
I swear to God, man,
she was all over me.


320
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.545
What was her name?

321
00:23:06.712 --> 00:23:08.505
She didn't tell me
her real name.


322
00:23:09.298 --> 00:23:10.507
Don't tell me.

323
00:23:11.008 --> 00:23:12.009
"If you forget..."

324
00:23:12.092 --> 00:23:13.302
"you just gotta look up."

325
00:23:13.385 --> 00:23:14.803
- Yeah.
- You knew Star?


326
00:23:14.887 --> 00:23:16.013
Briefly.

327
00:23:16.763 --> 00:23:18.765
Tell me about the guy
running the party.


328
00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:21.393
Persi? I... I didn't know
it was his party.


329
00:23:22.394 --> 00:23:24.480
Finds girls on OnlyFans
and Craigslist,


330
00:23:24.563 --> 00:23:26.732
turns 'em into porn stars
and escorts.


331
00:23:27.024 --> 00:23:29.026
They float around the scene
for a little bit


332
00:23:29.276 --> 00:23:30.996
then they just disappear,
that's all I know.


333
00:23:31.069 --> 00:23:32.362
What do you mean disappear?

334
00:23:32.488 --> 00:23:34.114
I mean they go back
to bumfuck Idaho


335
00:23:34.198 --> 00:23:35.491
wherever the hell
they came from.


336
00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:39.161
Man, this J-bird
fucking with you?


337
00:23:39.244 --> 00:23:41.330
No, man, we're all right,
aren't we?


338
00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:44.666
- Are we?
- Yeah, we're good.


339
00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:45.959
This is Jimmy Jayne.

340
00:23:46.043 --> 00:23:47.687
This guy's a motherfucking
legend right here.


341
00:23:47.711 --> 00:23:48.938
- True genius.
- Pleasure to meet you.


342
00:23:48.962 --> 00:23:51.048
Oh, so you guys inside together?

343
00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:53.217
- How'd you know?
- Come on, man.


344
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.219
'Cause all your other friends
that come here,


345
00:23:55.302 --> 00:23:56.512
look like Ken dolls.

346
00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:57.971
No offense.

347
00:23:58.055 --> 00:23:59.199
Yeah, fucking right we were in.

348
00:23:59.223 --> 00:24:00.891
This dude did half the art
in San Quentin.


349
00:24:00.974 --> 00:24:02.202
Why don't you tell him
about the time


350
00:24:02.226 --> 00:24:03.852
I fucked up Kratos in the yard?

351
00:24:03.936 --> 00:24:05.145
You know the story.

352
00:24:06.104 --> 00:24:09.191
Yeah, I remember that, sure.

353
00:24:10.651 --> 00:24:13.612
He was uh... he was fresh meat.

354
00:24:13.695 --> 00:24:15.548
Wouldn't let anybody
fuck with him, so he beat a man


355
00:24:15.572 --> 00:24:18.200
unconscious on his first night
with his bare hands.


356
00:24:18.742 --> 00:24:19.868
Yeah.

357
00:24:19.952 --> 00:24:21.245
Bullshit.

358
00:24:21.745 --> 00:24:24.206
- That's a fucking lie.
- It's a lie.


359
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:25.916
Hey, but you're a great friend

360
00:24:25.999 --> 00:24:28.127
to try to make this
punk-ass look good.


361
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.878
Hey, you can't talk to me
like that, bro.


362
00:24:29.962 --> 00:24:31.171
You're a fucking set mechanic.

363
00:24:31.255 --> 00:24:32.857
I'm number one
on the call sheet, all right.


364
00:24:32.881 --> 00:24:34.967
Calm down, kid. Calm down.

365
00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.387
You took this gig for money
just like everybody else.


366
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.805
We're making art, all right.

367
00:24:39.888 --> 00:24:40.973
- Art?
- Yeah.


368
00:24:41.056 --> 00:24:44.977
This show makes a dumpster fire
look like <i>Citizen Kane</i>.


369
00:24:45.102 --> 00:24:46.788
Yeah, well, this show
is number one in the country,


370
00:24:46.812 --> 00:24:47.980
we are number one.

371
00:24:48.063 --> 00:24:50.941
That says more about society
than the quality of your show.


372
00:24:51.316 --> 00:24:53.360
Hey, listen,
I have a 66 Chevelle


373
00:24:53.443 --> 00:24:54.987
that's got a bum clutch.

374
00:24:55.279 --> 00:24:56.905
- You got a card?
- Yeah.


375
00:24:58.407 --> 00:25:00.909
- Here man, call me anytime.
- Thank you.


376
00:25:00.993 --> 00:25:02.327
- You guys good?
- Yes, sir.


377
00:25:04.121 --> 00:25:05.706
Where you wanna do this?

378
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:07.958
Well, I want 1-1-7 right here.

379
00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:10.294
It's how many people watched
last week's episode.


380
00:25:10.544 --> 00:25:11.587
117?

381
00:25:11.795 --> 00:25:13.255
Million, yeah.

382
00:25:13.839 --> 00:25:16.025
I know, I can't believe people
pay to watch this shit either.


383
00:25:16.049 --> 00:25:17.301
Let's go in my trailer.

384
00:25:22.556 --> 00:25:23.640
Action!

385
00:25:27.311 --> 00:25:28.812
- Dennis!
- Hey, dude.


386
00:25:29.938 --> 00:25:30.938
Dennis, up!

387
00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:31.982
Oh, shoot!

388
00:25:34.193 --> 00:25:36.904
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

389
00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:16.443
Hi.

390
00:26:17.444 --> 00:26:18.654
Now what?

391
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:21.490
Well, found your fingerprints
on your lighter.


392
00:26:21.573 --> 00:26:22.991
Who'd have thought?

393
00:26:23.075 --> 00:26:23.992
And?

394
00:26:24.076 --> 00:26:26.912
We got motive, we got access,

395
00:26:27.454 --> 00:26:31.208
and we're one hair follicle away
from writing your warrant.


396
00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:33.335
How'd you find me?

397
00:26:33.418 --> 00:26:36.213
You got a GPS
in your pocket, buddy.


398
00:26:37.589 --> 00:26:38.989
You need a warrant
to track a phone.


399
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:41.468
You know you're actually correct
about that.


400
00:26:41.552 --> 00:26:44.304
But the thing is judges
these days, they're real busy


401
00:26:44.388 --> 00:26:45.708
and they know
we're the good guys.


402
00:26:45.764 --> 00:26:47.558
So they kinda let it slide.

403
00:26:47.766 --> 00:26:50.936
Now, you gonna offer me
a cigarette or what?


404
00:26:52.521 --> 00:26:55.107
No, it's cool, I actually quit.
Here's the deal.


405
00:26:55.357 --> 00:26:57.901
Everybody I talk to
across the board,


406
00:26:57.985 --> 00:27:00.362
they all say
you're a stand-up guy,


407
00:27:00.445 --> 00:27:02.197
except for the five years
in the pen


408
00:27:02.281 --> 00:27:04.408
for putting a guy
in a wheelchair.


409
00:27:06.285 --> 00:27:08.203
I didn't start that fight.

410
00:27:08.287 --> 00:27:10.414
But you sure ended it,
didn't you?


411
00:27:10.998 --> 00:27:13.041
And I bet you'd do it
all over again.


412
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.171
Came at me with a screwdriver.

413
00:27:17.254 --> 00:27:19.590
Screwdriver.
Shit, that's a deadly weapon.


414
00:27:22.926 --> 00:27:24.678
You know a guy named Persi?

415
00:27:25.053 --> 00:27:26.293
I don't remember his last name.

416
00:27:26.346 --> 00:27:27.764
Fucking Persi something,
whatever.


417
00:27:27.848 --> 00:27:29.141
Why?

418
00:27:29.683 --> 00:27:31.226
Used to run with Star.

419
00:27:31.435 --> 00:27:33.145
You playing detective now?

420
00:27:33.937 --> 00:27:36.440
Just concerned citizen.

421
00:27:36.815 --> 00:27:38.192
I like that.

422
00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:43.322
You know, uh, I found out
why you hang out at Rocka's bar.


423
00:27:46.617 --> 00:27:48.911
Should have just told me
your mom was a working gal.


424
00:27:48.994 --> 00:27:50.162
There's no shame in it.

425
00:27:50.579 --> 00:27:53.207
Detective Freeman,
he told me that was her spot


426
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.459
until, you know,
she went missing.


427
00:27:55.667 --> 00:27:56.919
And of course, your dad,

428
00:27:57.002 --> 00:27:59.129
he lost his mind
trying to find her.


429
00:27:59.213 --> 00:28:01.256
I'm just saying, you know,
I... I get it.


430
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.468
I understand why you feel
so connected to the case.


431
00:28:05.636 --> 00:28:07.513
Sure do have a way with words.

432
00:28:07.805 --> 00:28:10.182
Hey pal, James, Jimmy,

433
00:28:10.265 --> 00:28:11.934
I uh... you know,
that's as close


434
00:28:12.017 --> 00:28:14.269
as you're gonna get
to an apology from me.


435
00:28:14.728 --> 00:28:18.106
Yeah, fine, well...
I have to go.


436
00:28:18.315 --> 00:28:20.192
Just, hey, take it easy.

437
00:28:20.275 --> 00:28:21.652
Let us do our thing.

438
00:28:21.735 --> 00:28:23.904
Detective Freeman,
he's a great cop


439
00:28:23.987 --> 00:28:26.824
and me, I'm the best thing
that ever happened


440
00:28:26.907 --> 00:28:28.742
to the Robbery
-Homicide Unit.

441
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:32.371
How many cases
you close last year?


442
00:28:32.454 --> 00:28:34.206
You want my numbers now?
You want my stats?


443
00:28:34.289 --> 00:28:36.226
I mean, if they were any good,
you'd be squawking about 'em.


444
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.501
Oh, come on.

445
00:28:38.001 --> 00:28:39.795
You speak to Star's family?

446
00:28:40.712 --> 00:28:42.047
Tell 'em what happened?

447
00:28:42.131 --> 00:28:44.633
Well, they disowned her
a long time ago,


448
00:28:44.716 --> 00:28:46.844
but they're raising her kid
as their own.


449
00:28:48.554 --> 00:28:49.847
How old?

450
00:28:50.097 --> 00:28:53.183
4. Actually the same age
as my boy Terry.


451
00:28:56.228 --> 00:28:59.940
James, just don't go kicking
the hornet's nest.


452
00:29:00.023 --> 00:29:01.023
'Course not.

453
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.860
- You understand?
- Yes.


454
00:29:02.943 --> 00:29:04.695
Okay. I'll catch you later.

455
00:33:59.364 --> 00:34:01.450
Hey man, don't fuck that paint.

456
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.702
I can't be assed with an
I & D form.


457
00:34:06.663 --> 00:34:07.955
You got Roy.

458
00:34:08.207 --> 00:34:10.667
Roy, it's Jimmy.

459
00:34:11.167 --> 00:34:12.669
I met you on set.

460
00:34:12.753 --> 00:34:14.171
<i>Hey, buddy, what's going on?</i>

461
00:34:14.838 --> 00:34:16.714
<i>Someone tried to run me down
just now.</i>


462
00:34:16.799 --> 00:34:18.675
No shit.
Someone tried to kill you?


463
00:34:18.759 --> 00:34:20.511
<i>Yeah.</i>

464
00:34:20.718 --> 00:34:21.904
<i>That's not
what makes it personal,</i>


465
00:34:21.928 --> 00:34:23.888
so much as they fucked up
my ride.


466
00:34:24.138 --> 00:34:25.432
<i>Holy shit, man!</i>

467
00:34:25.515 --> 00:34:26.809
<i>You know who it was?</i>

468
00:34:26.934 --> 00:34:29.102
If I did, I wouldn't say so
on the phone.


469
00:34:30.062 --> 00:34:32.689
You know what, it's nothing.

470
00:34:33.482 --> 00:34:35.359
It don't sound like nothing
to me, man,


471
00:34:35.442 --> 00:34:38.070
but what's it like to be you?

472
00:34:38.153 --> 00:34:40.155
<i>It was a Rover Wagon.
It was super charged.</i>


473
00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.031
<i>Had some real fucking
balls to it.</i>


474
00:34:42.448 --> 00:34:44.993
Still not the smartest way
to try to kill somebody.


475
00:34:45.077 --> 00:34:47.788
<i>Yeah, maybe they're smarter
than you think, man.</i>


476
00:34:48.413 --> 00:34:51.375
Random ex-con cut down
on the side of the road?


477
00:34:51.457 --> 00:34:52.542
Who'd give a shit?

478
00:34:52.917 --> 00:34:55.169
Yeah, that's one way to put it,
I guess.


479
00:34:55.546 --> 00:34:58.048
<i>Rover's a lot bigger
than a bullet though, bro.</i>


480
00:34:58.132 --> 00:35:00.300
Oh no, they came at me
with those, too.


481
00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:02.469
Listen...

482
00:35:04.054 --> 00:35:07.766
I got this feeling that
you might be able to uh,


483
00:35:08.308 --> 00:35:10.269
you know, get me
some sort of protection.


484
00:35:10.352 --> 00:35:11.538
<i>You know what I'm talking about?</i>

485
00:35:11.562 --> 00:35:13.355
10-4, good buddy.

486
00:35:13.438 --> 00:35:16.400
I know you're a kindred soul
of the heathen brethren.


487
00:35:17.609 --> 00:35:19.236
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

488
00:35:19.319 --> 00:35:20.779
Of course it's a yes, man.

489
00:35:20.863 --> 00:35:22.030
Send me the address.

490
00:35:22.698 --> 00:35:24.032
I'll text it to you.

491
00:35:27.744 --> 00:35:29.538
So this doesn't add up.

492
00:35:30.664 --> 00:35:33.125
How does Jimmy go
from felony assault


493
00:35:33.208 --> 00:35:34.877
to multiple homicides?

494
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.046
I don't get it.

495
00:35:38.714 --> 00:35:40.007
- The old days...
- Yeah.


496
00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:43.051
You told me about, you'd just
taken a telephone book to 'em.


497
00:35:43.135 --> 00:35:44.553
Now I gotta actually
question people


498
00:35:44.636 --> 00:35:46.805
- and go fucking by the book.
- Right.


499
00:35:48.098 --> 00:35:49.349
- Yeah.
- Pain in the ass.


500
00:35:52.102 --> 00:35:53.102
- Well...
- Mhmm.


501
00:35:53.187 --> 00:35:54.605
I guess I'll take care
of this here,


502
00:35:54.688 --> 00:35:56.482
- you gonna hit the game?
- Yeah.


503
00:35:56.565 --> 00:35:57.691
Who is it this week?

504
00:35:57.774 --> 00:35:59.776
- Malibu.
- Right.


505
00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.695
If they don't beat them,
who can they beat?


506
00:36:01.778 --> 00:36:02.779
Yeah.

507
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:04.114
Exactly.

508
00:36:05.991 --> 00:36:07.618
I'll take care of this,
all right.


509
00:36:07.701 --> 00:36:09.119
- All right.
- I got it.


510
00:36:09.495 --> 00:36:10.829
I hope they win.

511
00:36:22.925 --> 00:36:24.551
I didn't think you'd show.

512
00:36:24.927 --> 00:36:27.930
Every brother needs a keeper
from time to time.


513
00:36:28.347 --> 00:36:29.973
Are you sure you want this?

514
00:36:30.849 --> 00:36:33.435
I got someone trying to pin
a bunch of murders on me.


515
00:36:34.311 --> 00:36:35.479
I'm not going back inside,

516
00:36:35.562 --> 00:36:37.481
especially not for something
I didn't do.


517
00:36:37.564 --> 00:36:39.608
Easy, new friend, easy.

518
00:36:39.691 --> 00:36:41.193
The fuck am I into?

519
00:36:41.735 --> 00:36:43.403
Show business, son.

520
00:36:43.821 --> 00:36:46.323
It's the most gangster game
out there.


521
00:36:46.406 --> 00:36:47.783
You got family?

522
00:36:48.325 --> 00:36:50.285
No, not since my dad died.

523
00:36:50.369 --> 00:36:51.787
Hmm, how'd he go?

524
00:36:52.788 --> 00:36:54.039
Bottle.

525
00:36:54.123 --> 00:36:55.332
Hmm.

526
00:36:55.415 --> 00:36:57.000
Come here, let's do this.

527
00:37:05.759 --> 00:37:07.427
Your dad teach you how to shoot?

528
00:37:09.054 --> 00:37:10.054
All right.

529
00:37:10.889 --> 00:37:12.850
You got six rounds in there.

530
00:37:16.395 --> 00:37:17.646
There you go.

531
00:37:22.693 --> 00:37:24.278
How much do I owe you?

532
00:37:24.903 --> 00:37:25.903
Nothing, man.

533
00:37:25.946 --> 00:37:27.614
Just a favor down the line.

534
00:37:28.615 --> 00:37:29.700
All right.

535
00:37:30.492 --> 00:37:31.535
Anytime.

536
00:37:31.618 --> 00:37:33.162
Yeah, I'll hold you to that.

537
00:37:33.412 --> 00:37:35.747
But you be careful, man.

538
00:37:37.166 --> 00:37:38.917
- See you.
- Thank you.


539
00:38:26.173 --> 00:38:28.217
I may have to get out of town.

540
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.968
We should go somewhere.

541
00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.805
Huh, I got that ticket
to Berlin, baby.


542
00:38:34.932 --> 00:38:36.183
What ticket?

543
00:38:36.809 --> 00:38:38.143
I didn't tell you?

544
00:38:40.145 --> 00:38:41.772
I would have remembered.

545
00:38:41.855 --> 00:38:43.607
I'm leaving Monday.

546
00:38:44.399 --> 00:38:46.902
Sandy is there as an au pair,

547
00:38:47.945 --> 00:38:50.906
we'll hang,
I hear it's a good scene.


548
00:38:52.699 --> 00:38:54.034
Berlin?

549
00:38:55.369 --> 00:38:56.787
It's in Germany.

550
00:38:58.539 --> 00:38:59.748
Yeah.

551
00:39:05.087 --> 00:39:07.172
You live in the moment, Jimmy.

552
00:39:10.425 --> 00:39:11.426
Yeah.

553
00:39:20.853 --> 00:39:22.020
Fucking Berlin.

554
00:39:56.346 --> 00:39:57.347
Jimmy Jayne.

555
00:39:57.431 --> 00:39:58.431
What's up, buddy?

556
00:39:58.474 --> 00:40:00.392
- How you doing?
- Good.


557
00:40:01.143 --> 00:40:02.394
I need a favor.

558
00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:07.542
You know I can't get back
into the evidence locker.


559
00:40:07.566 --> 00:40:08.585
They won't let me back there.

560
00:40:08.609 --> 00:40:10.253
- It's not that kind of favor.
- What is it?


561
00:40:10.277 --> 00:40:12.488
I need you to run a name
through IVIS.


562
00:40:15.365 --> 00:40:16.700
What's the name?

563
00:40:16.784 --> 00:40:17.951
Oh fuck.

564
00:40:18.952 --> 00:40:20.162
Uh...

565
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:23.832
Peter Mul...

566
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.251
Persi Mul, something or other.

567
00:40:26.335 --> 00:40:28.295
Mul something.
What is that?


568
00:40:29.129 --> 00:40:30.547
Persi Muleeney?

569
00:40:30.714 --> 00:40:31.882
That's it.

570
00:40:33.592 --> 00:40:34.832
Man, he lives up on Mulholland.

571
00:40:34.885 --> 00:40:36.720
He's got an office down
on Skid Row.


572
00:40:36.804 --> 00:40:37.721
You know him?

573
00:40:37.805 --> 00:40:39.181
Yeah, everybody knows him.

574
00:40:39.264 --> 00:40:40.682
He's a popular guy.

575
00:40:41.058 --> 00:40:42.559
Give me a current address.

576
00:40:44.269 --> 00:40:45.663
Look, man, is this something
that's gonna come back


577
00:40:45.687 --> 00:40:47.397
- and bite me in the ass?
- No, never.


578
00:40:47.481 --> 00:40:48.732
- Yeah.
- Absolutely not.


579
00:40:48.816 --> 00:40:50.818
Yeah, I believe you again, huh?

580
00:40:53.695 --> 00:40:55.615
Look, man, you know
I'll lie on the stand, right,


581
00:40:55.656 --> 00:40:57.074
say you had a gun to my head.

582
00:40:59.034 --> 00:41:00.410
That's why I love you, brother.

583
00:41:00.994 --> 00:41:02.621
You really are LA's finest, huh?

584
00:41:02.913 --> 00:41:04.193
Aww, that's sweet.
Fuck you, too.


585
00:41:05.457 --> 00:41:07.126
Can you tell me
what he's driving?


586
00:41:12.714 --> 00:41:17.719
Seems his 2011 Land Rover
was reported stolen yesterday.


587
00:41:32.609 --> 00:41:34.319
You didn't get that from me.

588
00:41:37.698 --> 00:41:39.700
He's having a party
up at his place tonight.


589
00:41:40.534 --> 00:41:42.870
Lot of cops gonna be there,
'cause we get in free.


590
00:41:43.662 --> 00:41:44.662
Yeah.

591
00:41:44.872 --> 00:41:47.082
Seems he knows what lives
matter most.


592
00:41:49.168 --> 00:41:50.377
All right.

593
00:41:51.503 --> 00:41:52.504
Stay lucky, buddy.

594
00:41:53.255 --> 00:41:55.674
Next time have the decency
to buy me a fucking coffee.


595
00:42:32.669 --> 00:42:33.796
Private party tonight.

596
00:42:34.671 --> 00:42:35.798
I'm on the list.

597
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.426
You a cop?

598
00:42:41.053 --> 00:42:42.971
Yeah, 14th.

599
00:42:45.516 --> 00:42:46.767
Where's your badge?

600
00:42:47.601 --> 00:42:48.769
It's in the car.

601
00:44:33.999 --> 00:44:35.918
<i>Want to hear a bad joke?</i>

602
00:44:37.419 --> 00:44:38.629
A bad joke?

603
00:44:38.712 --> 00:44:40.255
A really bad one.

604
00:44:45.052 --> 00:44:47.012
I do want to hear a bad joke.

605
00:44:47.095 --> 00:44:48.138
Shoot.

606
00:44:49.181 --> 00:44:53.393
What are the three words
to ruin man's ego?


607
00:44:54.603 --> 00:44:56.730
What are the three words
to ruin a man's ego?


608
00:45:00.526 --> 00:45:01.819
Is it in?

609
00:47:00.854 --> 00:47:02.022
So it's like '88, '89.

610
00:47:02.105 --> 00:47:04.858
We're driving to Barstow
like 3:00 in the morning, right.


611
00:47:05.651 --> 00:47:09.071
We're sweating like bullets,
and we run out of cocaine


612
00:47:09.655 --> 00:47:12.491
and I mean me and Tai,
we're sweating. We're sitt-


613
00:47:12.574 --> 00:47:14.134
Only thing I know is
we're gonna go meet


614
00:47:14.159 --> 00:47:15.639
a one-armed dope dealer
with a good...


615
00:47:15.744 --> 00:47:18.789
Yo. You Persi?

616
00:47:19.665 --> 00:47:21.500
I don't even know your name,
friend?


617
00:47:21.583 --> 00:47:22.751
Jimmy Jayne.

618
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:24.545
Mind if I have a minute?

619
00:47:24.628 --> 00:47:26.171
Mind if I have a...
Yeah, well, I mind.


620
00:47:26.255 --> 00:47:28.233
I'm sitting here telling a story
to all my friends.


621
00:47:28.257 --> 00:47:29.842
Is this about a job
or something?


622
00:47:30.092 --> 00:47:32.177
Yeah, I'm sorry.

623
00:47:33.178 --> 00:47:34.346
Go ahead, finish your story.

624
00:47:34.429 --> 00:47:36.348
You were with a couple of dudes
or something?


625
00:47:36.765 --> 00:47:38.642
So it's Barstow. Three-

626
00:47:38.725 --> 00:47:42.396
Barstow! Holy shit,
I love Barstow.


627
00:47:42.479 --> 00:47:43.522
You do, you love...

628
00:47:43.605 --> 00:47:45.858
They had the swap meet
down there, you ever been?


629
00:47:45.983 --> 00:47:46.984
I been to Barstow,

630
00:47:47.067 --> 00:47:48.336
I never been
to a fucking swap meet.


631
00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.987
- Street rods mostly.
- Yeah.


632
00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.196
I'm sorry.

633
00:47:52.156 --> 00:47:53.949
Go on. Finish your story.

634
00:47:54.449 --> 00:47:56.785
It's like 3:00 in the morning,
going into Barstow...


635
00:47:56.869 --> 00:47:57.744
Wait, wait, wait.

636
00:47:57.828 --> 00:47:58.704
Going into the Torches Motel...

637
00:47:58.787 --> 00:48:00.497
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

638
00:48:00.581 --> 00:48:01.582
You're ruining my story.

639
00:48:01.665 --> 00:48:05.294
One thing,
they got this red-headed mayor,


640
00:48:05.752 --> 00:48:09.089
I'm fucking telling you,
she's got big fucking tits.


641
00:48:09.214 --> 00:48:11.884
And man, she loves to ride.

642
00:48:12.217 --> 00:48:13.217
She loves to ride, huh?

643
00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.137
Who the fuck invited you
to my party?


644
00:48:16.096 --> 00:48:17.347
I invited me.

645
00:48:18.015 --> 00:48:19.683
I was hoping to have a minute
in private,


646
00:48:19.766 --> 00:48:21.768
but suit yourself.

647
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:28.901
Gisella, Lana, and Star.

648
00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:31.403
You ever heard
those names before?


649
00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.155
I'll give you a hint.

650
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.240
They're not fucking race horses.

651
00:48:35.365 --> 00:48:37.451
Kaiser, get this motherfucker
out of here.


652
00:48:37.618 --> 00:48:38.869
Hold on, Kaiser.

653
00:48:39.495 --> 00:48:40.621
You ever met 'em?

654
00:48:40.704 --> 00:48:42.247
No, I can't say I have.

655
00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:45.291
You like jokes?

656
00:48:45.375 --> 00:48:46.603
Yeah, who don't like
a fucking joke.


657
00:48:46.627 --> 00:48:48.227
If this is a joke,
I don't find it funny.


658
00:48:48.295 --> 00:48:50.088
I'ma tell you...
I'ma tell you a joke.


659
00:48:51.632 --> 00:48:53.759
Three words to ruin a man's ego?

660
00:48:53.842 --> 00:48:54.718
"Is it in?"

661
00:48:54.802 --> 00:48:56.011
Now get the fuck out.

662
00:48:57.513 --> 00:48:58.806
You heard that one before.

663
00:48:58.889 --> 00:49:00.599
Yeah, I heard,
I'm the one who wrote it.


664
00:49:00.682 --> 00:49:02.768
'Cause this girl told it
to me the other night.


665
00:49:02.851 --> 00:49:03.977
What girl?

666
00:49:04.061 --> 00:49:06.104
Same girl
you said you never met.


667
00:49:06.188 --> 00:49:07.105
She heard it in my movie.

668
00:49:07.189 --> 00:49:09.066
I just told you,
David Cop-A-Feel. It's...


669
00:49:09.149 --> 00:49:12.027
Anybody who watches pornos,
watch... knows the fucking line.


670
00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:12.986
It's famous.

671
00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:14.571
Now get the fuck out of here!

672
00:49:15.155 --> 00:49:16.448
Of course it is.

673
00:49:17.241 --> 00:49:18.408
Night, guys.

674
00:49:21.328 --> 00:49:22.496
Is that coke?

675
00:49:24.331 --> 00:49:25.666
And they're fucking passed out?

676
00:49:25.749 --> 00:49:27.417
Yeah, I got fucking coke.

677
00:49:27.876 --> 00:49:29.419
Can I rip a line of blow?

678
00:49:29.586 --> 00:49:30.814
You get the fuck
out of my house,


679
00:49:30.838 --> 00:49:31.964
you can't have none!

680
00:49:33.632 --> 00:49:35.300
Oh to be you, huh.

681
00:49:36.927 --> 00:49:38.595
Small dick motherfucker.

682
00:49:49.815 --> 00:49:52.609
- You really a cop?
- No.


683
00:50:00.033 --> 00:50:02.828
I seen them here, those girls.

684
00:50:04.121 --> 00:50:05.914
Come with a sista I knows.

685
00:50:06.874 --> 00:50:08.375
Eleanor Rogers.

686
00:50:09.001 --> 00:50:12.212
She's one, uh,

687
00:50:13.255 --> 00:50:14.631
Backup singer.

688
00:50:14.715 --> 00:50:16.049
Preacher's daughter.

689
00:50:19.344 --> 00:50:20.804
Why you telling me this?

690
00:50:22.139 --> 00:50:25.267
The fuck?
Motherfucker, I'm telling you.


691
00:50:26.143 --> 00:50:27.060
Leave it at that.

692
00:50:27.144 --> 00:50:28.520
Get the fuck outta here.

693
00:50:30.731 --> 00:50:31.940
Thanks.

694
00:51:58.569 --> 00:52:00.028
That was you singing, huh?

695
00:52:01.572 --> 00:52:02.823
Guilty.

696
00:52:05.451 --> 00:52:06.994
It's a recording studio?

697
00:52:13.375 --> 00:52:15.210
I'm looking for Miss Rogers.

698
00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:17.212
Miss Eleanor Rogers.

699
00:52:17.713 --> 00:52:18.839
Why?

700
00:52:20.215 --> 00:52:22.676
Our mutual friend Kaiser says
we should talk.


701
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.761
About?

702
00:52:25.762 --> 00:52:27.514
About something
we're both involved in,


703
00:52:27.598 --> 00:52:28.598
we shouldn't be.

704
00:52:34.646 --> 00:52:36.607
I'll be at Shay's on 3rd, okay.

705
00:52:37.399 --> 00:52:38.692
Hey, you got a light?

706
00:52:40.027 --> 00:52:41.320
Yeah.

707
00:52:48.243 --> 00:52:49.453
Don't lose it.

708
00:52:50.496 --> 00:52:52.664
There's already enough
of those floating around.


709
00:53:00.297 --> 00:53:02.299
You don't mean Persi Muleeney?

710
00:53:02.382 --> 00:53:05.093
Nah, he ain't got it in him
to murder any girls like that.


711
00:53:05.177 --> 00:53:06.303
He ain't that slick.

712
00:53:07.304 --> 00:53:10.140
But he knows some fucking cats
doing some fucked up shit.


713
00:53:10.933 --> 00:53:12.059
What cats?

714
00:53:12.726 --> 00:53:14.520
He likes to strut
with a scary crowd


715
00:53:14.603 --> 00:53:16.063
with his tail all up in the air.

716
00:53:16.146 --> 00:53:18.041
But as much as he likes to be
on this gangsta shit,


717
00:53:18.065 --> 00:53:21.318
they just take his money
and laugh at his dumb white ass.


718
00:53:21.401 --> 00:53:22.653
Drug people?

719
00:53:22.736 --> 00:53:23.736
Fuck yeah.

720
00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:25.489
Cartel hookup.

721
00:53:25.572 --> 00:53:26.716
Why's someone like you
hanging out


722
00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.450
with someone shady like Persi?

723
00:53:29.118 --> 00:53:30.577
Someone like me?

724
00:53:32.704 --> 00:53:34.265
He told me
he'd put up all kinds of money


725
00:53:34.289 --> 00:53:35.999
to help me put out a solo album.

726
00:53:36.625 --> 00:53:37.793
And did he?

727
00:53:39.378 --> 00:53:40.462
No.

728
00:53:41.338 --> 00:53:43.257
Said if I could fuck like
I could sing...


729
00:53:45.843 --> 00:53:47.487
Well, I'm not even gonna
tell you the rest of that


730
00:53:47.511 --> 00:53:48.947
'cause I don't want
my father's ghost


731
00:53:48.971 --> 00:53:50.291
hearing that
come out of my mouth.


732
00:53:52.391 --> 00:53:54.143
Persi said
he never met the girls.


733
00:53:54.226 --> 00:53:56.478
Oh, honey, no, no, he lied.

734
00:53:57.229 --> 00:53:58.480
What else?

735
00:53:59.106 --> 00:54:02.109
Those girls, I mean, oh my God,

736
00:54:02.943 --> 00:54:05.445
the way they were found
like that, I mean,


737
00:54:05.529 --> 00:54:07.364
that was somebody sending
a message.


738
00:54:07.447 --> 00:54:09.032
You said that wasn't
Persi's style.


739
00:54:09.158 --> 00:54:10.075
No, no.

740
00:54:10.159 --> 00:54:12.828
I think it was...
it was like those people


741
00:54:12.911 --> 00:54:14.538
I was talking about earlier,

742
00:54:14.621 --> 00:54:17.583
the ones that likes to use
Persi's house like it's theirs.


743
00:54:17.666 --> 00:54:18.917
"Scary crowd".

744
00:54:19.209 --> 00:54:20.878
Shit, you ain't heard this
from me.


745
00:54:21.462 --> 00:54:23.172
That scene is a blackhole.

746
00:54:23.797 --> 00:54:25.340
Girls come up missing
all the time,


747
00:54:25.424 --> 00:54:26.734
guys always trying
to take advantage


748
00:54:26.758 --> 00:54:27.801
of the situation.

749
00:54:28.927 --> 00:54:31.054
There was this one creeper
at a party one night.


750
00:54:31.138 --> 00:54:32.282
Late like 4:00 in the morning.

751
00:54:32.306 --> 00:54:33.390
Silver-haired dude.

752
00:54:33.474 --> 00:54:35.767
Now we were gonna go
to the patio and get high.


753
00:54:35.851 --> 00:54:38.353
Anyway, the silver-haired dude
was inside


754
00:54:38.437 --> 00:54:40.606
and I saw him talking to some
girls who had been there,


755
00:54:40.689 --> 00:54:43.775
I'd seen them a couple of times
and they were giving him money.


756
00:54:44.359 --> 00:54:45.861
About a week later,
I'm pulled over


757
00:54:45.944 --> 00:54:47.821
for not using my turn signal,
and it was him,


758
00:54:47.905 --> 00:54:49.031
the silver-haired dude.

759
00:54:49.114 --> 00:54:50.115
He's a fucking cop.

760
00:54:50.199 --> 00:54:52.284
- Is he a stocky guy?
- Yes, yeah.


761
00:54:52.367 --> 00:54:53.368
Uh, Flosso.

762
00:54:53.452 --> 00:54:55.013
Officer Flosso,
that was the name on the ticket.


763
00:54:55.037 --> 00:54:55.913
Right, right.

764
00:54:55.996 --> 00:54:57.915
The girl said
he was a cage fighter.


765
00:55:00.167 --> 00:55:03.712
Our friend Kaiser,
I need to talk to him again.


766
00:55:03.796 --> 00:55:04.898
Well, I'll give you his number,

767
00:55:04.922 --> 00:55:06.465
but, you know,
don't expect much.


768
00:55:06.548 --> 00:55:09.676
He's a moody motherfucker,
like you.


769
00:55:13.764 --> 00:55:16.892
Oh, one more thing,
and maybe it's nothing


770
00:55:16.975 --> 00:55:20.062
but the silver-haired guy,
I saw him take some money


771
00:55:20.145 --> 00:55:22.731
and then give it to this guy,
the "Doc".


772
00:55:22.815 --> 00:55:24.233
Well, we called him
"Dr. Feelgood",


773
00:55:24.316 --> 00:55:26.068
because, you know,
he was giving out


774
00:55:26.151 --> 00:55:28.028
pills like it was candy.

775
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.240
Big beard
and the curly-ish hair,


776
00:55:31.323 --> 00:55:32.991
deep voice, like...

777
00:55:34.576 --> 00:55:37.121
I don't fucking know,
that also happened.


778
00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:39.790
I don't know if that helps.

779
00:55:40.999 --> 00:55:42.501
I wish I'd met you a week ago.

780
00:55:43.127 --> 00:55:45.963
Oh, what do you do?

781
00:55:46.713 --> 00:55:48.048
What do I do?

782
00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:49.675
Yeah?

783
00:55:50.008 --> 00:55:53.095
Um, uh, a lotta this, lately.

784
00:55:53.178 --> 00:55:56.014
No, when you're not creeping
on singers outside of studios.


785
00:55:56.098 --> 00:55:57.266
Did you say creeping?

786
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:58.350
I...

787
00:55:59.393 --> 00:56:00.936
Um, what do I do?

788
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:03.689
- I do uh, I do tattoos.
- Hmm.


789
00:56:03.772 --> 00:56:07.109
And uh... motors.

790
00:56:07.442 --> 00:56:09.153
- Hmm, rock 'n' roll life.
- Yeah.


791
00:56:09.236 --> 00:56:10.445
- Very cool.
- It's right.


792
00:56:10.529 --> 00:56:11.697
It's good people mostly.

793
00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.657
- Yeah.
- You got any ink?


794
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.868
Oh man, no.

795
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.537
I never found anything that
I wanted to stay with me


796
00:56:18.662 --> 00:56:19.538
for life, you know.

797
00:56:19.621 --> 00:56:20.706
Oh.

798
00:56:21.123 --> 00:56:23.542
Sometimes a tattoo
is just a tattoo.


799
00:56:23.625 --> 00:56:26.503
Okay, well then how come
most girls get a rose


800
00:56:26.587 --> 00:56:27.838
or a dolphin?

801
00:56:28.589 --> 00:56:30.340
Fucking angel wings.

802
00:56:30.424 --> 00:56:32.801
- How trashy is that?
- TouchÃ©.


803
00:56:32.885 --> 00:56:34.720
- It's so trashy, right.
- TouchÃ©.


804
00:56:34.803 --> 00:56:36.889
Yeah, well, you know
times are... times are tough.


805
00:56:36.972 --> 00:56:38.056
Ink is ink.

806
00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:39.784
Oh, and that's when you do
those kind of tattoos.


807
00:56:39.808 --> 00:56:41.268
I draw the line at tramp stamps.

808
00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:43.145
Oh.

809
00:56:44.021 --> 00:56:46.273
Well, it is good to know
there's a line.


810
00:56:46.356 --> 00:56:47.733
Yeah, there is.

811
00:56:48.192 --> 00:56:49.860
No, they all mean something.

812
00:56:52.237 --> 00:56:54.364
- It's not gonna run out on you.
- No.


813
00:56:54.448 --> 00:56:56.950
That's a different story,
probably a different tattoo.


814
00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:04.124
Oh, I have to go.

815
00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:06.001
That is my 15.

816
00:57:06.335 --> 00:57:07.628
I've got an audition.

817
00:57:07.711 --> 00:57:08.754
Mm?

818
00:57:08.837 --> 00:57:10.506
Uh I hope that this helped.

819
00:57:11.423 --> 00:57:13.091
Changed my day around.

820
00:57:13.175 --> 00:57:14.718
Oh, fine.

821
00:57:15.177 --> 00:57:16.512
Maybe I'll see you around.

822
00:57:16.595 --> 00:57:18.388
- Good luck on your audition.
- Thank you.


823
00:57:18.472 --> 00:57:19.681
You're welcome.

824
00:58:09.565 --> 00:58:12.067
Meet me behind the station.
I have something to show you.


825
00:58:34.715 --> 00:58:35.799
Yo.

826
00:58:36.508 --> 00:58:38.635
Yeah, we've... we've been
shooting all night.


827
00:58:38.969 --> 00:58:41.013
Jayne busted into my party
the other night,


828
00:58:41.472 --> 00:58:43.640
asking me about Star
and the others.


829
00:58:43.974 --> 00:58:45.034
Nah, I didn't tell him shit.

830
00:58:45.058 --> 00:58:46.685
The asshole ruined my high.

831
00:58:48.061 --> 00:58:49.605
You gotta be cool, bro.

832
00:58:51.356 --> 00:58:52.733
There's some girls here.

833
00:58:56.111 --> 00:58:58.614
Yeah, I still got 'em,
come on up.


834
00:58:58.989 --> 00:58:59.989
Okay, cool.

835
00:59:03.994 --> 00:59:06.205
Hey, yo, what...
what are you doing here?


836
00:59:06.622 --> 00:59:09.022
You don't... you can't just come
over to my office like this.


837
00:59:32.064 --> 00:59:34.399
Looking for Persi?
All the way down to the left.


838
00:59:48.747 --> 00:59:49.998
Bye, Juicy.

839
01:00:25.659 --> 01:00:26.702
Hey.

840
01:00:28.162 --> 01:00:29.163
What is it, Jimmy?

841
01:00:29.246 --> 01:00:30.664
You're gonna wanna see this.

842
01:00:30.747 --> 01:00:31.790
What?

843
01:00:31.874 --> 01:00:34.376
You need to move your car
before we get it towed.


844
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.878
Yeah, I could move it.

845
01:00:36.712 --> 01:00:38.505
I could drive it
right to the morgue.


846
01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:40.257
What are you talking about?

847
01:00:47.264 --> 01:00:48.640
Who's pulling the strings?

848
01:00:50.017 --> 01:00:51.661
Who could throw the body
of a giant in a trunk


849
01:00:51.685 --> 01:00:53.020
without nobody seeing?

850
01:00:54.104 --> 01:00:55.439
Whoever did it, picked the locks

851
01:00:55.522 --> 01:00:57.858
in the parking lot on Franklin
where they threw the body.


852
01:00:58.567 --> 01:01:00.194
In broad daylight?

853
01:01:01.278 --> 01:01:02.380
They did it sometime
in the morning


854
01:01:02.404 --> 01:01:03.822
while I was having breakfast.

855
01:01:03.947 --> 01:01:05.240
You've been tracking my cell,

856
01:01:05.324 --> 01:01:07.242
you know
I couldn't have done this.


857
01:01:07.576 --> 01:01:08.994
I don't know, buddy.

858
01:01:09.077 --> 01:01:12.998
I think somebody's seriously
fucking with you, big time.


859
01:01:13.749 --> 01:01:15.000
Or warning me.

860
01:01:16.084 --> 01:01:18.045
Maybe they knew Kaiser
was trying to help me.


861
01:01:18.128 --> 01:01:19.254
Yeah.

862
01:01:19.338 --> 01:01:21.048
Now don't you think
the smart thing to do


863
01:01:21.131 --> 01:01:22.341
would have been to tell us

864
01:01:22.424 --> 01:01:25.093
about this when the Land Rover
first tried to run you down?


865
01:01:26.595 --> 01:01:28.931
I've never been accused
of being smart.


866
01:01:29.014 --> 01:01:30.014
Right.

867
01:01:30.098 --> 01:01:33.769
What about your visit
to Persi's party?


868
01:01:33.852 --> 01:01:35.354
Persi had nothing to do with it.

869
01:01:35.938 --> 01:01:37.397
He's just a bad host.

870
01:01:37.481 --> 01:01:38.625
If I were you,
I would check the people


871
01:01:38.649 --> 01:01:40.567
at the Chateau party,
that's where I'd start.


872
01:01:41.902 --> 01:01:45.155
Sorry, buddy,
afraid we have to keep the car.


873
01:01:47.908 --> 01:01:50.285
Okay. Well, don't scratch it.

874
01:01:50.452 --> 01:01:51.662
Don't fuck with the radio.

875
01:01:51.745 --> 01:01:54.540
No scratch, no problem.

876
01:01:55.124 --> 01:01:56.458
Who's driving me home?

877
01:01:57.209 --> 01:01:58.669
I'll drive you home.

878
01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:12.432
Hey, no smoking in the cruiser.

879
01:02:13.183 --> 01:02:14.685
It's regulations.

880
01:02:14.768 --> 01:02:16.186
All right,
have a couple of puffs,


881
01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:17.312
I'll wait.

882
01:02:23.402 --> 01:02:25.028
What a fucking day, man.

883
01:02:25.529 --> 01:02:27.322
Yeah, me too.

884
01:02:28.448 --> 01:02:29.867
Persi's dead.

885
01:02:30.534 --> 01:02:32.870
Yeah, I know,
a real loss to humanity.


886
01:02:33.912 --> 01:02:34.997
How'd he go?

887
01:02:35.372 --> 01:02:36.707
Snapped neck.

888
01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:41.295
Now look, I'm only gonna
tell you this once,


889
01:02:41.628 --> 01:02:43.589
I don't think you're involved
in this


890
01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:46.091
any more than somebody
wants you to be.


891
01:02:46.175 --> 01:02:47.217
Okay.

892
01:02:49.803 --> 01:02:51.263
I'm next.

893
01:02:52.389 --> 01:02:53.849
I think you're right.

894
01:02:54.183 --> 01:02:55.350
How's that?

895
01:02:56.477 --> 01:02:59.313
You know something
you don't even know you know.


896
01:02:59.396 --> 01:03:03.442
Or somebody wants you to know
something, you know.


897
01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:06.737
Let's hit it.

898
01:03:06.862 --> 01:03:08.071
Put that out.

899
01:03:44.316 --> 01:03:45.901
So this how you live?

900
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:51.114
Yeah, Dad left me the house.

901
01:03:52.241 --> 01:03:56.453
Mortgaged to get the shop,
couldn't make the payment, closed,


902
01:03:57.162 --> 01:03:59.540
told the family moving in that this
is a separate property.


903
01:04:00.332 --> 01:04:02.918
So what, they can kick you out
anytime they want?


904
01:04:05.546 --> 01:04:07.005
I don't know, James.

905
01:04:09.091 --> 01:04:11.093
All right, concerned citizen,

906
01:04:12.344 --> 01:04:15.389
why don't you tell me
who you think's involved?


907
01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:16.681
Flosso.

908
01:04:17.182 --> 01:04:18.350
Flosso?

909
01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:20.477
He's an ex-fighter.

910
01:04:20.561 --> 01:04:21.561
Huh.

911
01:04:21.603 --> 01:04:24.148
He'd certainly know how to
break their necks clean enough.


912
01:04:24.231 --> 01:04:26.608
So this preacher's daughter,
your source,


913
01:04:26.692 --> 01:04:28.193
she for certain it was him?

914
01:04:28.944 --> 01:04:31.446
Yeah, he's working for somebody.

915
01:04:32.072 --> 01:04:33.615
Well, that makes sense,
'cause Flosso,


916
01:04:33.699 --> 01:04:35.284
he's a real dumb shit.

917
01:04:35.367 --> 01:04:37.369
He wouldn't be able to do it
on his own.


918
01:04:37.661 --> 01:04:40.247
I'll look him up,
I'll see what I can find.


919
01:04:42.624 --> 01:04:44.585
Hey Vargas,
how well you know your partner?


920
01:04:46.044 --> 01:04:47.254
Why you ask?

921
01:04:48.881 --> 01:04:50.299
'Cause I think he's dirty.

922
01:04:52.092 --> 01:04:54.720
I think he found my lighter
and thought I was an easy mark.


923
01:04:55.596 --> 01:04:57.347
You're reaching, buddy.

924
01:04:57.681 --> 01:05:00.100
And you better be careful
what you're saying.


925
01:05:00.934 --> 01:05:02.352
He have an alibi?

926
01:05:02.603 --> 01:05:04.646
Matter of fact he does.

927
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:07.524
He was half in the bag
over at the Montello.


928
01:05:07.733 --> 01:05:09.169
How're the cameras at the
Montello Lounge?


929
01:05:09.193 --> 01:05:10.235
- They're good.
- Yeah?


930
01:05:10.319 --> 01:05:11.403
Yeah.

931
01:05:11.987 --> 01:05:14.281
If you check the video footage
and you see him


932
01:05:14.364 --> 01:05:16.617
leaving between 2:00 and 2:30,
then I was right.


933
01:05:17.367 --> 01:05:20.579
And if I'm right,
I just wanna know about it.


934
01:05:20.662 --> 01:05:23.123
No. All right,
no more cowboy shit.


935
01:05:23.582 --> 01:05:25.810
I'll take a look at the tapes,
but I can already tell you


936
01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:27.586
what I'm gonna find, okay.

937
01:05:27.669 --> 01:05:30.672
And by the way,
you're all wrong about Freeman.


938
01:05:31.381 --> 01:05:34.092
He's a good guy,
he's my kid's godfather.


939
01:05:37.012 --> 01:05:38.347
Hitler loved dogs.

940
01:05:38.972 --> 01:05:39.848
Huh.

941
01:05:39.932 --> 01:05:41.183
What's your point?

942
01:05:42.267 --> 01:05:44.061
My point is
some of the most evil people


943
01:05:44.186 --> 01:05:46.188
in the world
still have great smiles.


944
01:05:47.731 --> 01:05:48.732
That's interesting.

945
01:05:49.149 --> 01:05:50.609
Just do me a favor.

946
01:05:50.692 --> 01:05:52.319
Stand down, all right.

947
01:05:52.402 --> 01:05:54.446
You done enough, okay?

948
01:05:57.866 --> 01:05:58.992
It's depressing.

949
01:06:21.557 --> 01:06:22.808
<i>What's your name?</i>

950
01:06:26.353 --> 01:06:27.604
<i>Star.</i>

951
01:06:31.692 --> 01:06:35.070
If you forget, just look up.

952
01:07:14.526 --> 01:07:15.986
The shit's vegan, right?

953
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:18.238
Makeup? It's vegan?

954
01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:19.448
Go check.

955
01:07:19.531 --> 01:07:21.617
It's in my contract,
vegan makeup!


956
01:07:41.637 --> 01:07:43.806
Don't fucking say anything,
I'm mic'd.


957
01:07:47.351 --> 01:07:49.520
Okay, you know
what it looks like... I'm fr...


958
01:07:49.603 --> 01:07:51.021
Shut the fuck up!

959
01:07:51.188 --> 01:07:52.314
Shut up!

960
01:07:54.775 --> 01:07:56.109
You lied to me.

961
01:07:57.027 --> 01:07:58.880
You lie to me again,
I'll break your fucking face,


962
01:07:58.904 --> 01:08:00.072
you understand?

963
01:08:00.447 --> 01:08:01.824
- You understand?
- Yeah.


964
01:08:01.907 --> 01:08:03.033
- Yeah?
- Okay.


965
01:08:08.872 --> 01:08:10.290
Tell me about Persi.

966
01:08:10.707 --> 01:08:11.707
Fuck, man.

967
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:13.895
I was embarrassed to admit
that I was hanging with Persi


968
01:08:13.919 --> 01:08:16.004
'cause he is a fucking scumbag,
okay.


969
01:08:16.088 --> 01:08:18.108
But it's not illegal to drink
his booze and eat his food,


970
01:08:18.132 --> 01:08:21.135
not to mention, fucking pussy
flying around that place.


971
01:08:21.218 --> 01:08:22.970
I mean, anything goes there.

972
01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.804
Like what?

973
01:08:25.848 --> 01:08:28.267
Some local cops there
hanging out now,


974
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:29.977
playing poker in the back.

975
01:08:31.812 --> 01:08:34.106
That's not all that's going on
back there.


976
01:08:34.188 --> 01:08:36.066
Yeah, I heard a few pimped
some girls,


977
01:08:36.150 --> 01:08:37.818
but that's none
of my fucking business.


978
01:08:37.901 --> 01:08:39.903
I had nothing to do
with those dead hookers.


979
01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:43.782
Star and her friends,
did they go to this party?


980
01:08:43.866 --> 01:08:46.326
Yeah, man, I said that,
I seen them there a few times


981
01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:48.495
but there's 50 fucking girls
there every night.


982
01:08:48.579 --> 01:08:50.831
You wanna talk to someone?
Talk to Erasmus.


983
01:08:51.081 --> 01:08:52.833
Am I supposed to know
who that is?


984
01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:54.460
Erasmus Alcindor.
He's a screenwriter.


985
01:08:54.543 --> 01:08:57.254
He's a fucking hack,
looks like a ferret.


986
01:08:57.713 --> 01:08:59.380
He used to date Star.

987
01:08:59.882 --> 01:09:01.443
Look, I don't know
why they dated either,


988
01:09:01.467 --> 01:09:02.986
she's a fucking beautiful girl
messing around


989
01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:04.720
with some fucking creep.

990
01:09:05.053 --> 01:09:07.133
He used to lie to her
and say he'd put her in movies.


991
01:09:08.807 --> 01:09:11.684
He talks to that cop Flosso,
all the time.


992
01:09:13.896 --> 01:09:15.188
Where can I find him?

993
01:09:16.063 --> 01:09:17.232
Erasmus?

994
01:09:17.858 --> 01:09:20.402
He lives in those shithole apartments
in Persi's studios.


995
01:09:20.986 --> 01:09:22.571
I swear to fucking God, man.

996
01:09:22.778 --> 01:09:24.740
Fuck God, I swear to you, okay?

997
01:09:24.822 --> 01:09:26.742
He knows everything about
their operation.


998
01:09:26.825 --> 01:09:27.826
Everything.

999
01:09:32.581 --> 01:09:34.875
I swear to you,
I swear, I swear, I...


1000
01:09:34.958 --> 01:09:37.461
Listen, listen,
you little bitch.


1001
01:09:37.753 --> 01:09:39.880
- You gonna lie to me again?
- No.


1002
01:09:39.963 --> 01:09:42.108
- You gonna lie to me again?
- No, I'm not gonna lie again!


1003
01:09:42.132 --> 01:09:43.132
No!

1004
01:10:30.389 --> 01:10:31.515
Erasmus?

1005
01:10:51.743 --> 01:10:52.870
Go away!

1006
01:10:53.245 --> 01:10:54.329
Erasmus?

1007
01:10:54.413 --> 01:10:56.290
Are you fucking deaf?
He's not here.


1008
01:11:03.839 --> 01:11:05.757
This can go one of two ways.

1009
01:11:05.841 --> 01:11:08.321
You watch who you're throwing insults
out of your word-hole to,


1010
01:11:08.385 --> 01:11:10.179
you... you...
the wrong person hears it,


1011
01:11:10.471 --> 01:11:12.723
and you'll be in a fucking
cheap hotel room dead,


1012
01:11:12.806 --> 01:11:13.891
you hear me?

1013
01:11:17.478 --> 01:11:18.687
Fuck, man.

1014
01:11:19.021 --> 01:11:20.021
I'm a pacifist!

1015
01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:21.607
I'm a pacifist!

1016
01:11:22.107 --> 01:11:23.233
Fuck.

1017
01:11:23.317 --> 01:11:24.317
I'm not.

1018
01:11:26.403 --> 01:11:27.696
You going somewhere?

1019
01:11:27.779 --> 01:11:28.655
Babylon has fallen,

1020
01:11:28.739 --> 01:11:30.574
can't you see
it's the last days of Rome?


1021
01:11:35.996 --> 01:11:37.456
You want to know what I see?

1022
01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:42.836
I see a piece of shit
who's in way over his head


1023
01:11:43.003 --> 01:11:44.564
who's gonna tell me
all about his girlfriend.


1024
01:11:44.588 --> 01:11:45.881
Which one?

1025
01:11:46.089 --> 01:11:47.591
You know which one.

1026
01:11:47.674 --> 01:11:48.884
Fucking Star.

1027
01:11:48.967 --> 01:11:50.820
Star's not my girlfriend,
you sperm-less testicle,


1028
01:11:50.844 --> 01:11:52.095
she's my friend.

1029
01:11:52.429 --> 01:11:54.681
Alright, women, I'm not a threat
to them, they trust me,


1030
01:11:54.765 --> 01:11:56.433
they bare
their midnight fantasies,


1031
01:11:56.517 --> 01:11:57.684
their hopes and dreams.

1032
01:12:00.729 --> 01:12:05.442
Alright, I'm telling you
that she was an angel! Star.


1033
01:12:05.734 --> 01:12:07.796
They should've called her
"The-Whole-fucking-Galaxy".


1034
01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:08.737
Who killed her?

1035
01:12:08.821 --> 01:12:10.781
It's not that simple, man.

1036
01:12:10.864 --> 01:12:12.104
She was...
it's not that simple.


1037
01:12:12.157 --> 01:12:14.368
She was blackmailing us...
them, them!


1038
01:12:14.451 --> 01:12:16.036
That's not an admission
of guilt.


1039
01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.372
- She was blackmailing them.
- Who?


1040
01:12:18.455 --> 01:12:20.183
I tried to stop her,
but she brought the others


1041
01:12:20.207 --> 01:12:21.208
- in on it.
- Who?


1042
01:12:21.291 --> 01:12:22.793
All the girls, man.

1043
01:12:23.168 --> 01:12:25.587
Persi used to run drugs
up from Mexico.


1044
01:12:25.671 --> 01:12:27.714
He had to find a way
to launder the money,


1045
01:12:27.798 --> 01:12:28.942
so he got in the film business

1046
01:12:28.966 --> 01:12:30.592
and then he started
trafficking girls,


1047
01:12:30.676 --> 01:12:32.302
all the girls
who wanna be in his movies.


1048
01:12:32.469 --> 01:12:34.429
Didn't ask for a fucking resume.

1049
01:12:34.513 --> 01:12:36.348
Tell me who killed Star.

1050
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:38.642
Flosso, man.

1051
01:12:38.976 --> 01:12:41.687
They always used Flosso to keep
the girls in line.


1052
01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:42.980
Don't fucking lie to me.

1053
01:12:43.063 --> 01:12:44.690
Don't fucking lie to me.

1054
01:12:44.773 --> 01:12:47.151
Half the fucking precinct
is in it, man.


1055
01:12:47.234 --> 01:12:49.111
How you think they wear
such nice suits?


1056
01:12:49.194 --> 01:12:50.237
I want names.

1057
01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.865
Goddammit, Flosso is a name!

1058
01:12:52.948 --> 01:12:54.324
Flosso is a name.

1059
01:13:00.747 --> 01:13:02.124
Who ordered the hit?

1060
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:04.251
Who ordered the hit!

1061
01:13:04.334 --> 01:13:05.586
He'll kill me.

1062
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:07.087
I'll fucking kill you.

1063
01:13:07.171 --> 01:13:08.672
Who ordered the hit?

1064
01:13:09.047 --> 01:13:10.299
Freeman.

1065
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:12.968
- Detective...
- Don't fucking lie to me, man.


1066
01:13:15.304 --> 01:13:17.473
I'm telling the truth, man.

1067
01:13:17.556 --> 01:13:19.475
I overheard him
and Persi talking.


1068
01:13:21.602 --> 01:13:24.354
It's... it's not killing women
to them, man.


1069
01:13:24.438 --> 01:13:26.899
It's more like clearing out
rotten inventory.


1070
01:13:26.982 --> 01:13:29.943
Like difficult women
make bad hookers, man.


1071
01:13:30.277 --> 01:13:33.322
And you were...
you were the perfect fall guy.


1072
01:13:33.405 --> 01:13:34.698
You screwed everything up, man.

1073
01:13:34.781 --> 01:13:37.534
Now Flosso's in the wind
and they want us all dead.


1074
01:13:39.286 --> 01:13:40.579
How are you involved?

1075
01:13:41.163 --> 01:13:43.499
Me, I'm just a writer, man.

1076
01:13:43.582 --> 01:13:44.625
I schedule the girls.

1077
01:13:44.708 --> 01:13:46.585
I make sure
they have a good time.


1078
01:13:46.668 --> 01:13:48.837
I take care of the girls,
that's it.


1079
01:13:49.087 --> 01:13:50.255
And Vargas?

1080
01:13:50.881 --> 01:13:52.257
You seen him around?

1081
01:13:52.341 --> 01:13:54.343
Freeman keeps him in the dark,
man.


1082
01:13:54.426 --> 01:13:56.470
Vargas is the worst detective
in the city.


1083
01:13:58.806 --> 01:13:59.723
I'm going to my mom's.

1084
01:13:59.807 --> 01:14:01.127
I should have never left
Glendale.


1085
01:14:03.936 --> 01:14:04.978
Yeah.

1086
01:14:06.522 --> 01:14:07.606
Just pulled up.

1087
01:14:08.482 --> 01:14:09.733
What are you talking about?

1088
01:14:10.818 --> 01:14:12.194
To the parlor.

1089
01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.073
Rent here on Melrose
must be outrageous.


1090
01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.950
Wait, what?

1091
01:14:19.034 --> 01:14:20.869
Jimmy, you just texted me

1092
01:14:20.953 --> 01:14:22.788
- saying to meet you here.
- No. No, hey run.


1093
01:14:22.955 --> 01:14:23.872
<i>Get out of there.</i>

1094
01:14:23.956 --> 01:14:24.996
<i>Get the fuck out of there.</i>

1095
01:14:26.792 --> 01:14:28.460
<i>Hey? Hey!</i>

1096
01:14:40.681 --> 01:14:42.474
- Vargas?
- Hey, where are you, Jimmy?


1097
01:14:42.724 --> 01:14:45.018
Freeman's mixed
into this for sure.


1098
01:14:45.102 --> 01:14:46.103
<i>Yeah, fuck, 
I know that.</i>

1099
01:14:46.186 --> 01:14:48.230
Look,
I just went to The Montello.


1100
01:14:48.438 --> 01:14:50.649
They already handed over
their tapes to guess who?


1101
01:14:50.732 --> 01:14:51.732
Yeah.

1102
01:14:51.775 --> 01:14:54.361
So listen, Star, she worked
the concession stand


1103
01:14:54.444 --> 01:14:55.737
at this old movie theatre.

1104
01:14:55.821 --> 01:14:58.365
She sent an encrypted file
to her boss.


1105
01:14:58.782 --> 01:15:01.285
Forensics, they're trying
to unlock it right now, okay.


1106
01:15:01.368 --> 01:15:04.037
Hey, that source
I told you about,


1107
01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:05.456
the preacher's daughter,

1108
01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:07.958
she somehow got a text
from my phone.


1109
01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:10.085
I was talking to her
when she was abducted.


1110
01:15:10.169 --> 01:15:12.421
Hold on, okay.
We're gonna get an APB out.


1111
01:15:12.588 --> 01:15:15.591
Also a bystander ID'd Flosso
leaving the scene


1112
01:15:15.674 --> 01:15:17.676
where Star and her friends
were found.


1113
01:15:17.759 --> 01:15:18.969
<i>You understand that?</i>

1114
01:15:19.595 --> 01:15:21.472
You speak to your captain
about the tapes?


1115
01:15:21.555 --> 01:15:23.223
<i>Look, I haven't talked
to anybody yet.</i>


1116
01:15:23.307 --> 01:15:24.475
<i>Where was she?</i>

1117
01:15:24.558 --> 01:15:25.893
She's right outside my shop.

1118
01:15:25.976 --> 01:15:26.977
<i>Okay, listen,</i>

1119
01:15:27.102 --> 01:15:28.413
I'm gonna roll units over
right now.


1120
01:15:28.437 --> 01:15:29.730
Do not go inside, Jimmy.

1121
01:15:29.813 --> 01:15:31.482
- You hear me?
- Oh no.


1122
01:15:31.565 --> 01:15:32.900
<i>Do not engage.</i>

1123
01:15:32.983 --> 01:15:34.026
Okay.

1124
01:15:35.861 --> 01:15:36.987
Okay.

1125
01:19:36.059 --> 01:19:37.144
Cuff him.

1126
01:19:42.858 --> 01:19:44.109
Fuck you!

1127
01:20:33.033 --> 01:20:34.076
Farry.

1128
01:20:34.785 --> 01:20:35.828
<i>Captain.</i>

1129
01:20:36.537 --> 01:20:37.412
You alone?

1130
01:20:37.496 --> 01:20:39.123
- <i>Yeah, what's going on?</i>
- All right.


1131
01:20:39.206 --> 01:20:40.874
It's Freeman,
gotta bring him in.


1132
01:20:41.458 --> 01:20:42.543
<i>He's dirty.</i>

1133
01:20:42.793 --> 01:20:43.793
<i>Just busted Flosso.</i>

1134
01:20:43.877 --> 01:20:45.546
He was trying to kill a witness.

1135
01:20:45.838 --> 01:20:46.838
Got it?

1136
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.215
Fuck, he just left.

1137
01:21:22.207 --> 01:21:23.542
What's your hurry, Bill?

1138
01:21:31.508 --> 01:21:32.593
So stupid.

1139
01:21:51.278 --> 01:21:52.529
Where they take her?

1140
01:21:53.697 --> 01:21:54.990
I don't know.

1141
01:21:56.408 --> 01:21:57.969
I could drive this thing
into the Pacific,


1142
01:21:57.993 --> 01:21:59.912
or you can give me an
exact address.


1143
01:22:09.171 --> 01:22:10.798
You're gonna die anyways.

1144
01:22:12.174 --> 01:22:15.385
Now you can lie to me,
I can make it real slow,


1145
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:19.681
or you can tell me the truth
and maybe I'll make it fast.


1146
01:22:20.474 --> 01:22:21.642
Maybe.

1147
01:22:23.435 --> 01:22:25.354
I didn't want any of this.

1148
01:22:25.938 --> 01:22:27.231
It was Freeman.

1149
01:22:28.065 --> 01:22:30.442
Fucking Freeman caught me
with a gram.


1150
01:22:30.567 --> 01:22:32.319
One gram.

1151
01:22:34.696 --> 01:22:36.615
Told me he'd get IA
to take my badge away


1152
01:22:36.698 --> 01:22:39.535
and put me away for three years
if I didn't work for him.


1153
01:22:43.789 --> 01:22:45.290
You killed Star?

1154
01:22:47.584 --> 01:22:48.919
Yeah, I did.

1155
01:22:53.006 --> 01:22:54.216
Where's Eleanor?

1156
01:22:57.219 --> 01:22:58.512
San Diego.

1157
01:22:59.847 --> 01:23:04.393
They got a restaurant,
a fridge leads to a tunnel.


1158
01:23:06.145 --> 01:23:07.563
What's this tunnel?

1159
01:23:09.898 --> 01:23:14.736
The kind of tunnel that connects
San Diego with Tijuana.


1160
01:23:16.864 --> 01:23:18.365
Freeman runnin' the operation?

1161
01:23:18.448 --> 01:23:19.616
Fuck no.

1162
01:23:20.033 --> 01:23:23.203
It's some broker, Dr. Feelgood.

1163
01:23:24.788 --> 01:23:26.415
He's a dangerous cat
though, man.


1164
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.958
He's got eyes everywhere.

1165
01:23:30.335 --> 01:23:31.628
- Hey.
- Hmm.


1166
01:23:32.004 --> 01:23:34.214
I tell you where they are,
I'll take you to 'em,


1167
01:23:35.549 --> 01:23:37.092
you gotta let me go.

1168
01:23:38.427 --> 01:23:40.095
It's a fair trade, right?

1169
01:23:42.973 --> 01:23:44.057
Yeah.

1170
01:23:45.267 --> 01:23:46.268
Yeah.

1171
01:23:47.019 --> 01:23:48.103
Okay.

1172
01:23:52.024 --> 01:23:53.775
- Hey!
- Stop that car!


1173
01:23:53.859 --> 01:23:54.860
Hey!

1174
01:24:02.743 --> 01:24:03.994
Okay, took a left.

1175
01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.505
I told you to be ready.

1176
01:24:56.922 --> 01:24:59.800
I do not work to your schedule,
detective.


1177
01:25:00.008 --> 01:25:01.301
Where's Flosso?

1178
01:25:01.677 --> 01:25:05.180
As soon as we get safe,
he's next.


1179
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:07.850
She's doped up
and ready for transport.


1180
01:25:08.684 --> 01:25:12.271
Buyers pay well
for American girls, age aside.


1181
01:25:12.521 --> 01:25:14.565
Just make sure I get my cut.

1182
01:25:40.841 --> 01:25:42.050
This the place?

1183
01:25:43.677 --> 01:25:44.887
Yeah.

1184
01:25:47.473 --> 01:25:49.099
Fridge's in the back.

1185
01:25:52.686 --> 01:25:54.521
Now you're gonna let me go,
right?


1186
01:25:56.190 --> 01:25:57.566
Man of your word.

1187
01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:02.529
Yeah.

1188
01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:39.126
Stop, stop!

1189
01:27:40.127 --> 01:27:41.336
Stop!

1190
01:27:47.759 --> 01:27:48.759
In here!

1191
01:29:20.269 --> 01:29:21.937
Freeman, you prick!

1192
01:29:26.441 --> 01:29:28.694
Hey, I can get you
whatever you want.


1193
01:29:28.819 --> 01:29:30.362
Money, girls.

1194
01:29:30.445 --> 01:29:31.989
You motherfucker.

1195
01:29:32.656 --> 01:29:34.283
You know the damage you've done?

1196
01:29:36.326 --> 01:29:37.536
I have an idea.

1197
01:29:38.078 --> 01:29:39.455
I have a family.

1198
01:29:39.872 --> 01:29:41.623
I worked for my life.

1199
01:29:41.832 --> 01:29:43.417
Kill!

1200
01:29:59.933 --> 01:30:01.059
Hey, hey.

1201
01:30:01.143 --> 01:30:02.823
Don't... don't... don't...
don't you do it!


1202
01:30:24.917 --> 01:30:26.376
You motherfucker.

1203
01:30:54.446 --> 01:30:55.446
Jimmy.

1204
01:30:57.825 --> 01:30:59.034
It's okay.

1205
01:31:02.079 --> 01:31:03.664
Wasn't supposed to...

1206
01:31:05.916 --> 01:31:07.835
to end like this.

1207
01:31:13.674 --> 01:31:15.551
Say hi to my mom.

1208
01:31:31.733 --> 01:31:33.360
Please don't do it.

1209
01:31:35.112 --> 01:31:36.488
Not this way.

1210
01:31:38.198 --> 01:31:39.616
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1211
01:32:39.843 --> 01:32:40.969
Who is that?

1212
01:32:41.386 --> 01:32:42.721
Identify yourself!

1213
01:32:43.597 --> 01:32:45.057
Identify yourself!

1214
01:32:47.851 --> 01:32:50.229
Where's Freeman? Huh?

1215
01:32:50.562 --> 01:32:51.772
Where's Freeman?

1216
01:32:54.024 --> 01:32:55.400
What happened out there?

1217
01:32:56.568 --> 01:32:58.654
Your son's gonna need
a new godfather.


1218
01:33:07.788 --> 01:33:10.124
<i>What are the three words
to ruin a man's ego?</i>


1219
01:33:13.752 --> 01:33:15.045
Is it in?

1220
01:33:20.467 --> 01:33:22.219
- I know it's funny.
- Yeah, no.


1221
01:33:22.302 --> 01:33:24.930
- 'Cause it's true.
- I bet, I bet.


1222
01:33:27.599 --> 01:33:28.809
Where you from?

1223
01:33:30.978 --> 01:33:33.063
Very far away from here.

1224
01:33:34.565 --> 01:33:36.066
You here for the movies?

1225
01:33:37.192 --> 01:33:38.527
Real movies.

1226
01:33:38.944 --> 01:33:40.362
But I just arrived.

1227
01:33:40.946 --> 01:33:42.239
I worked in a theatre,

1228
01:33:42.322 --> 01:33:47.828
but they don't show
the kinda movies I'm in now.


1229
01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:49.746
Oh?

1230
01:33:50.789 --> 01:33:53.667
The theatre manager was such
a nice guy.


1231
01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:56.628
Not like my new bosses.

1232
01:33:56.712 --> 01:34:01.091
They are,
how do you say... pigs.


1233
01:34:05.471 --> 01:34:06.930
You like that work?

1234
01:34:11.935 --> 01:34:13.145
No.

1235
01:34:19.401 --> 01:34:22.196
Can you work a front desk?
Can you type?


1236
01:34:23.614 --> 01:34:24.907
Why?

1237
01:34:26.158 --> 01:34:29.161
My secretary left
with my business partner.


1238
01:34:31.497 --> 01:34:33.332
- Things happen.
- Things happen.


1239
01:34:35.542 --> 01:34:36.877
Things happen.

1240
01:34:44.092 --> 01:34:46.053
Be there tomorrow,
you got a job.


1241
01:34:46.303 --> 01:34:47.638
I mean no pressure.

1242
01:34:49.473 --> 01:34:50.390
Jimmy Jayne.

1243
01:34:50.474 --> 01:34:51.517
Jimmy Jayne.

1244
01:34:52.893 --> 01:34:55.979
Thanks for being
such a good guy.


1245
01:34:56.730 --> 01:34:58.357
I don't know about that.

1246
01:34:58.982 --> 01:35:00.025
Persi wants us.

1247
01:35:00.108 --> 01:35:01.276
He has a car outside already.

1248
01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.360
Yeah.

1249
01:35:03.862 --> 01:35:06.615
Hey, what's your name?

1250
01:35:08.075 --> 01:35:09.201
Star.

1251
01:35:09.576 --> 01:35:11.703
If you forget, just look up.

1252
01:35:16.458 --> 01:35:19.503
Hey. Bye Star.

1253
01:35:29.221 --> 01:35:30.347
Star...

1254
01:35:38.105 --> 01:35:39.356
Thank you.
