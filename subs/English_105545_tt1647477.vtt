1
00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.926
What do you want?

2
00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.817
I want him.

3
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:48.446
I want him back.

4
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.697
I want him back!

5
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:50.476
Aah!

6
00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.532
Oh!

7
00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:58.707
Oh, no! No! Aah!

8
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.207
Aah!

9
00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.354
Oh!

10
00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:51.513
Open the door, Paige.

11
00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.476
I know you're in there.

12
00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.349
I know you're in there.

13
00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.806
Come on, Paige, open the door.

14
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.893
Please open the door!

15
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.693
Open up, Paige!

16
00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:06.894
Open up!

17
00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.782
OK, Paige.

18
00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.950
I'm gonna come in.

19
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.869
I'm gonna come in.

20
00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.571
I'm coming in!

21
00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.498
Aaaaaaah!

22
00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.466
Hey, Paige.

23
00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.794
Paige, it's Janice.

24
00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:33.880
You gonna talk?

25
00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:40.057
Paige?!

26
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.018
Please, please. I'm so sorry.

27
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.820
I'm so sorry. Please, please.

28
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.816
Please. I'm so sorry.

29
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.318
Yeah, I'm sorry, Paige.

30
00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:52.240
I'm sorry, too.

31
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.440
Aah!

32
00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:59.998
Paige.

33
00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:05.921
Paige. Paige!

34
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.292
Aaaaaah!

35
00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.882
Aah!

36
00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.517
What do I do with this?

37
00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:30.065
Ohhh!

38
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.021
No, no!

39
00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.229
Aah!

40
00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:42.532
Hello? Hello?

41
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.742
Please help me.

42
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.043
Please help me.

43
00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.838
Somebody's in my...in my house,

44
00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:51.336
and she's...

45
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.793
No, she's still here.

46
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.001
I don't know.

47
00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:59.508
Plea...um, uh, at

48
00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.595
1134 Fairway Drive.

49
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.850
Please.

50
00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:10.356
I don't know. She shot me.

51
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.985
Please. Please.

52
00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.113
I'm gonna...

53
00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:08.394
How you doing?

54
00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.063
OK. How are you?

55
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.982
Can't complain.

56
00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:15.776
Something I can help you with?

57
00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:18.105
Well, uh...

58
00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:19.312
I...I don't know.

59
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.153
I'm not sure what I'm looking

60
00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:21.778
for.

61
00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:23.781
Well, I reckon it's a gun or

62
00:07:23.985 --> 00:07:25.111
you wouldn't be here.

63
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:27.572
Yeah, I guess.

64
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.578
Did you have something in

65
00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:30.157
mind?

66
00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.834
No, not really.

67
00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:34.207
Uh, know anything about guns?

68
00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:35.538
No.

69
00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:41.800
Well, let's see.

70
00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:45.052
Ah.

71
00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:48.180
This here is a stainless-steel

72
00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:50.762
.38 special, and it holds six

73
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.517
rounds.

74
00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:05.360
Ooh, it's heavy.

75
00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.366
Aw, it's not too bad.

76
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.072
Ever fired a gun before?

77
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:09.951
No, sir.

78
00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.954
Well, this one's just perfect

79
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:12.909
for you, then.

80
00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:14.744
Not much kick to it, which is

81
00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:15.623
good for a lady.

82
00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.045
And it's a revolver, so you

83
00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:18.366
don't have to worry about it

84
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.250
ever jamming.

85
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.381
Hold it up.

86
00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:30.719
How's it feel?

87
00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:31.723
Good, I guess.

88
00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.180
<i>You should never buy a gun</i>

89
00:08:33.387 --> 00:08:34.855
unless it feels just right in

90
00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:38.310
your hands.

91
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:41.988
Yeah, it feels good.

92
00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:43.531
How much does it cost?

93
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:46.234
Oh, I could do, say...

94
00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:47.864
$150.

95
00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.913
OK. Uh...

96
00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:52.410
Don't I have to wait a couple of

97
00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:53.286
days or so?

98
00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:54.208
Nope, not no more.

99
00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:55.705
Just got to do a background

100
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.285
check.

101
00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:57.245
It takes five minutes.

102
00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:58.249
Oh.

103
00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:00.707
Uh, didn't ever kill anyone,

104
00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:01.915
did you?

105
00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.169
No.

106
00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.674
You just fill out these

107
00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:06.128
forms.

108
00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:08.214
I'll get you rung up down here.

109
00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:10.424
Okey-dokey.

110
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.131
See you later, Janice.

111
00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:17.033
Mrs.Trimble.

112
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:17.742
Uh, yes.

113
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.418
I was saying I wanted to

114
00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.791
thank you and your son for

115
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.212
coming down here today.

116
00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:22.834
Uh-huh.

117
00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.541
I think we can all agree we'd

118
00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.342
like to put this whole ordeal

119
00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:27.589
behind us as quickly and

120
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:30.216
painlessly as possible.

121
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.219
After an extensive review of the

122
00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:34.016
police report, as well as

123
00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:35.843
ms. Alexander's deposition, we

124
00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.804
have come up with terms that we

125
00:10:38.012 --> 00:10:39.389
feel are both fair and

126
00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:40.974
beneficial for all parties

127
00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:41.808
concerned.

128
00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:43.814
It is clear ms. Alexander has

129
00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:45.861
feelings for your son, despite

130
00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:48.030
his terrible actions, and is

131
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.823
truly concerned for his

132
00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:50.650
well-being.

133
00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:52.485
Therefore, the state would be

134
00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:54.240
willing to drop all criminal

135
00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.163
charges on the condition he

136
00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:57.661
undergo a full psychiatric

137
00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:59.242
evaluation at the state

138
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.918
hospital, the result of which

139
00:11:01.118 --> 00:11:02.495
would determine the type of

140
00:11:02.703 --> 00:11:04.125
therapy he requires and,

141
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.832
ultimately, the possible need

142
00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.089
for long-term inpatient care.

143
00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:10.533
I will tell you that I have had

144
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.717
a brief discussion with

145
00:11:11.921 --> 00:11:12.922
Dr.Khamis at the state

146
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.330
hospital, and he's informed me

147
00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:15.967
that based on past patients with

148
00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:17.768
your son's condition, most have

149
00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.437
required a minimum therapeutic

150
00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:22.186
rehabilitation of three to five years.

151
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.392
Of course, some can take longer.

152
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.728
Others even become permanent residents.

153
00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:28.233
It all just depends on

154
00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:30.610
individual progress.

155
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.659
This is the only offer I will be
presenting to the judge.


156
00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.281
I'm confident that he will agree

157
00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:36.954
that your son is a threat to

158
00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:38.326
both himself and others.

159
00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.499
Therefore, an evaluation of this

160
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.202
kind is not only recommended,

161
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.038
but it will be deemed mandatory.

162
00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:46.418
We will step out now and give

163
00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:51.622
you a moment to confer with your counsel.

164
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.444
Well?

165
00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:22.692
I will not let them put my
son in a crazy-people hospital.


166
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.498
Is there something else you can say?

167
00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:28.297
Something you can do?

168
00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:32.001
What would you like me to say?

169
00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:35.383
That he didn't do it.

170
00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:38.137
That they're wrong.

171
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.014
That that little...

172
00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:45.564
That girl is lying.

173
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:49.360
Mrs.Trimble, we have to look
at the facts, and what the facts


174
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.813
are saying is that
we can't win this case.

175
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.945
The evidence against Jakob is considerable.

176
00:12:55.149 --> 00:13:00.201
She has his skin underneath her
fingernails, scratch marks on


177
00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:06.537
his chest, bruises, traces of
his semen found inside of her.


178
00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:11.090
Your son has a disability that makes
him prone to random acts of aggression.


179
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.588
Now, it's her word against his,

180
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:16.137
and he can't speak.

181
00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:22.185
I don't...I don't care.

182
00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:25.137
He didn't do it!

183
00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:27.474
I know my boy would never do that.

184
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:29.399
And I will not let them put him

185
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.570
in a place with...for people
like that.


186
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.738
No!

187
00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:37.863
Well, it's not your decision.

188
00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.740
Your boy is not a minor...he's
an adult.


189
00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:40.944
He can be tried as one.

190
00:13:41.028 --> 00:13:46.501
I am his court-appointed
attorney, not yours.


191
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.579
I have to look
out for his best interests.

192
00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:55.260
And it's...it's my professional
opinion that...this is our best


193
00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:57.928
course of action.

194
00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:02.851
Oh, god.

195
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.098
I don't need your permission.

196
00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:08.897
I'm sorry, but I am going to
agree to these terms.


197
00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:12.602
It's OK.

198
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.689
It's OK, Jakob.

199
00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:18.115
It's OK.

200
00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:21.034
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

201
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:22.578
shh, shh, shh, shh.

202
00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:36.301
Oh, god.

203
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:42.428
Jakob.

204
00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:45.430
Oh, baby. Jakob!

205
00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:47.636
I love you!

206
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.694
Let him go.

207
00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:57.738
He doesn't like to be touched.

208
00:14:57.938 --> 00:15:02.819
He doesn't like to be touched!

209
00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:07.658
I love you! I love you, Jakob!

210
00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:11.119
I love you.

211
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:15.173
Oh, no!

212
00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:17.921
Oh, my...

213
00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:33.391
Oh.

214
00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:34.854
Hello?

215
00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.606
Janice, it's me.

216
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.810
Oh, Charles.

217
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.565
You're not still at home, are you?

218
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.617
I mean, I have to
be in the prosecutor's office in

219
00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:44.817
...in less than an hour.

220
00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:46.612
Yeah. I'm sorry, um, but I

221
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.290
don't think I'm gonna be
able to drive you today.

222
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:54.246
What? Why?

223
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.126
Charles, I don't think I can...

224
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.752
I can do this by myself.

225
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.676
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry.
W-what I'm saying is...I...I


226
00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:06.883
don't think I'm gonna be able to
come around anymore...at all.


227
00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:10.595
Look...I...I know this isn't the
best time.


228
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:13.647
I've been married twice, and
I got my own kids.

229
00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.599
They've all grown up one way or

230
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.812
the other, and I'm done with all that.

231
00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:24.116
I just...I can't deal with
another, not at my age.


232
00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:29.493
I don't want to,
especially one with so much...

233
00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:30.448
Aw, hell.

234
00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.784
You don't mean...you don't

235
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.962
mean that, do you, Charles?

236
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.162
Charles, I can't believe

237
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:38.714
you're...you're saying this to

238
00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:40.507
me right now.
I mean, you just can't.


239
00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:43.086
Well, there's no difference
if it happened now or later.


240
00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:45.888
I think we both know
that this wasn't gonna last.

241
00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:49.592
Let's just be happy we had some
good times together.


242
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.848
Oh, Charles, now, please.

243
00:16:52.052 --> 00:16:52.644
I...I

244
00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:53.937
now, I got to go.

245
00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:56.607
Charles.
You take care there.


246
00:16:56.807 --> 00:16:58.935
Charles.

247
00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:01.145
Charles?!

248
00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:04.232
Charles, wait!

249
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.534
Charles!!

250
00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:07.734
Aah!

251
00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:22.337
Jakob.

252
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.964
Jakob, get away from the window.

253
00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:28.298
Get away from the window, Jake.

254
00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:30.223
We have to...come help me with
the bag.


255
00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:32.847
We have to go.

256
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.771
Jakob, come on.
Help me with the bag.


257
00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:37.723
We have to get going.

258
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:39.478
It's time to go.

259
00:17:39.683 --> 00:17:43.859
Oh, Jakob.

260
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:50.036
Come on, Jakob.
Jakob, come on. Let's go.


261
00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:51.828
Come on, son!

262
00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:58.833
Look at mommy. Let's go.

263
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:04.634
Jakob.

264
00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:06.676
Jakob!

265
00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:10.302
It's your mother calling you.
Come on!


266
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:13.055
We have to go.

267
00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:28.198
Um...

268
00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:34.998
Can I help you?

269
00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:38.872
It's OK.

270
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.329
It's oh...you're OK.

271
00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:52.010
You'll be fine, Jakob.

272
00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:54.433
Jakob.

273
00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:23.789
Here you go.

274
00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:27.250
Thanks for lunch.
It was really nice.


275
00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:33.136
You're welcome.

276
00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:34.965
Wouldn't you like to come in

277
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:36.847
for a few minutes?

278
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.848
Um...

279
00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:40.474
You know what?

280
00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:43.307
I better not.
I got a lot of things I got to


281
00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:44.232
get done today.

282
00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:48.939
Mm-hmm.
Well, thanks.


283
00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:57.079
Oh!

284
00:19:57.279 --> 00:19:59.532
Oh! What is it, Paige?
What happened?


285
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.741
Don't touch me!

286
00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:02.997
Oh! Jakob!

287
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:05.830
Oh, my god! Jakob!

288
00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.541
Jakob. Jakob?

289
00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:09.796
Jakob, where are you?

290
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.547
Jakob. Jakob!

291
00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:15.472
Jake! Oh, my baby!

292
00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:16.924
My baby. Oh.

293
00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:18.930
Aah!

294
00:20:20.844 --> 00:20:24.849
Shh. Oh. Oh, my baby.

295
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:27.976
OK, I'll be right out with

296
00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:32.986
that.

297
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.612
Y'all still working on these?

298
00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:35.567
No, go ahead.

299
00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:36.776
No. Thank you.

300
00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:37.819
So, how was everything?

301
00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:40.827
Well, it was very good.
I just love that chicken salad.


302
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:43.409
Oh, yeah, it's one of my favorites, too.

303
00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:44.664
Any dessert today?

304
00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:46.120
Well, I was kind of...

305
00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:47.420
No, that's OK.

306
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.921
I was kind of eying that
chocolate cake over there.


307
00:20:51.124 --> 00:20:53.673
Maybe we could share it.

308
00:20:53.877 --> 00:20:54.877
Chocolate cake?

309
00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:56.846
Are you sure nothing for you, hon?

310
00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:57.297
Yeah.

311
00:20:57.506 --> 00:20:58.007
All right.

312
00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:05.941
I'll be right back with that.
Thank you.


313
00:21:06.139 --> 00:21:06.856
You OK?

314
00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:09.401
You've been awful quiet over there today.

315
00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.899
Oh, no, I'm 
- I'm fine.

316
00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.653
I just...I was hungry, I guess,

317
00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:19.077
and...well, I...I don't know.

318
00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:20.951
Um...

319
00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:22.201
Eh, never mind.

320
00:21:22.406 --> 00:21:23.874
You sure?

321
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.917
Yeah, yeah.
Nothing to worry about.


322
00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.496
OK.

323
00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:29.956
Well, I'd just like to say

324
00:21:30.163 --> 00:21:34.043
thanks again for yet another great meal.

325
00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:36.049
And I was thinking that maybe...

326
00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:37.049
Hold the thought.

327
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:45.254
I...the little boys' room is
calling.


328
00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.937
Here you go.

329
00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.267
Enjoy.

330
00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:53.399
Thank you. It looks good.

331
00:22:04.281 --> 00:22:06.454
Mmm.

332
00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:09.832
Mmm. Try some.
Nah.


333
00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:13.211
All right, Janice...

334
00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:16.089
I'm gonna ask you something.

335
00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.842
Now, I hope you don't
take this the wrong way.

336
00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:23.347
OK. OK.

337
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:28.101
Have you ever given any
thought...to the idea of maybe


338
00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:31.559
putting Jakob into some kind of...I don't know

339
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:33.986
...care facility?

340
00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:36.359
Why would you ever
ask me something like that?

341
00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:37.985
Well, I know it can't be easy

342
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.863
on you having someone like that around.

343
00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:42.490
"Someone like that"?

344
00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:43.160
He's my son.

345
00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:46.036
Yeah, and before you know it,
he's gonna be 30 years old.


346
00:22:46.239 --> 00:22:47.582
I mean, how long do you think

347
00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:49.626
you can keep it
up, taking care of him?

348
00:22:49.826 --> 00:22:50.998
As long as he needs me.

349
00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:54.548
That's exactly what I'm getting at.

350
00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:57.092
He's gonna need you forever.

351
00:22:57.292 --> 00:23:01.013
And I just thought, wouldn't it

352
00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:02.635
be easier to...

353
00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:07.640
It's not about being easier.

354
00:23:07.844 --> 00:23:09.141
I don't think I want to talk

355
00:23:09.346 --> 00:23:10.347
about this anymore.

356
00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:13.104
That's fair enough.

357
00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:14.059
He's your boy.

358
00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:19.194
He's my boy.

359
00:23:19.398 --> 00:23:21.116
Try the cake.
How is it?


360
00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:28.996
It's pretty good.
It's pretty good.


361
00:23:29.199 --> 00:23:33.375
You look really nice, honey.

362
00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:37.879
You're gonna be meeting mommy's
new friend tonight.


363
00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.178
So...let's try to have a good

364
00:23:41.378 --> 00:23:44.052
time, OK, Jakob?

365
00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:46.008
OK?

366
00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:07.325
Oh. That's him.

367
00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:09.122
Oh. Oh, come on.

368
00:24:09.322 --> 00:24:10.539
Come on, Jakob.

369
00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:12.243
Shh. It's good.

370
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:14.169
Sit down over here.

371
00:24:14.369 --> 00:24:16.087
It's mommy's friend. OK.

372
00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:22.716
Just a sec.

373
00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:23.511
Hey, there.

374
00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:25.714
Hi.

375
00:24:25.922 --> 00:24:27.219
Come on in. Come in.

376
00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:29.267
Oh, I finally get to see your

377
00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:31.061
house on the inside.

378
00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:35.232
It's nice.
It's homey.


379
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:36.604
And this must be Jakob.

380
00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.185
How you doing there, buddy?

381
00:24:38.393 --> 00:24:39.861
Did your mom tell you that I got

382
00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:41.153
a boy about your same age?

383
00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:45.864
So, he really doesn't say

384
00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.660
anything ever?

385
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:50.159
No.
Well, what does he...what


386
00:24:50.363 --> 00:24:50.989
does he do?

387
00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:52.198
Does he do anything?

388
00:24:52.365 --> 00:24:58.247
Charles.
Shit, I don't know.


389
00:24:58.455 --> 00:25:00.833
Uh, he's a good boy.

390
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:03.635
He's just...

391
00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.257
He's a - he's a good boy.

392
00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:07.260
Well, regardless, it's...

393
00:25:07.464 --> 00:25:10.934
It's good to finally meet you, Jakob.

394
00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:18.434
He doesn't really like being touched.

395
00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:20.144
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

396
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.275
Uh, would you like some coffee?

397
00:25:22.479 --> 00:25:24.231
I have some made up in the kitchen.

398
00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:25.816
I'd love some. 
Black, please.

399
00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:27.367
OK. Just have a seat there.

400
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:32.567
Um, you two can get better acquainted.

401
00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:01.016
Oh. Here you go.

402
00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:01.810
Oh, thanks.

403
00:26:02.018 --> 00:26:03.895
How are you two getting along?

404
00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:06.527
Oh, just fine.
In fact, I was just getting


405
00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:09.860
ready to tell Jake here about
the time, uh, my buddy Rico


406
00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:13.072
flipped his 18-wheeler on
interstate 80 back in '91.


407
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.908
Oh! That sounds fun.

408
00:26:16.116 --> 00:26:19.211
Yeah, um...I was about 5

409
00:26:19.411 --> 00:26:21.755
miles out from the accident when

410
00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:23.298
I get an alert on my C.B. from

411
00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:25.842
another driver who saw the whole
thing in his rear-view.


412
00:26:26.042 --> 00:26:26.213
Ooh.

413
00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:28.887
So, I get there.
I'm the first on the scene.


414
00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:31.260
And, you know, his trailer was demolished.

415
00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:34.343
His load...about 25 cattle...
Scattered around everywhere,


416
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:37.395
some of them dead,
some of them alive and

417
00:26:37.596 --> 00:26:38.313
wandering off up into the hills.

418
00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:41.187
There was this one poor heifer.
Listen to this.


419
00:26:41.391 --> 00:26:42.483
She got it the worst.

420
00:26:42.684 --> 00:26:46.734
You know, she had four broken
legs, no skin on one side of her


421
00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:50.738
body, and I'm sure all kinds of
damage on the inside.


422
00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:52.795
She's just howling and screaming something awful.

423
00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:54.196
Jake.

424
00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:57.954
Well, this state trooper
shows up, and he's a young guy,


425
00:26:58.158 --> 00:27:00.377
rookie.
He decides he's gonna put the


426
00:27:00.577 --> 00:27:03.797
beast down, you know, put
it out of its pain.

427
00:27:03.997 --> 00:27:06.341
So he takes out his gun.

428
00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:09.385
He puts it right between that heifer's eyes.

429
00:27:09.586 --> 00:27:10.633
Pow!

430
00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:12.635
Oh-
yeah.


431
00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:14.386
I'm not shitting you, this

432
00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:16.218
sucker was still alive.

433
00:27:16.426 --> 00:27:17.426
Shh, shh, shh.

434
00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:19.304
So he shoots it again.

435
00:27:19.512 --> 00:27:20.512
Bam! And again...bam!

436
00:27:20.555 --> 00:27:21.555
Charles, Charles.

437
00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:25.023
And the thing's rolling around
on the ground and screaming.


438
00:27:25.226 --> 00:27:27.479
So he shoots it
again and again and again.

439
00:27:27.687 --> 00:27:29.906
And the thing is still god damn alive.

440
00:27:30.106 --> 00:27:31.733
So you know what this stupid son

441
00:27:31.942 --> 00:27:32.942
of a bitch does?

442
00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:34.986
He takes this great big fucking...

443
00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:39.662
Jakob! Jakob! Jakob!
Are you OK?!


444
00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:41.368
Where is your bathroom?

445
00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:44.420
Upstairs. Jakob! Oh, baby!

446
00:27:44.621 --> 00:27:47.249
OK, OK!
Come on, honey, let me do that.


447
00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:48.457
Let mommy help you.

448
00:27:49.626 --> 00:27:52.880
Oh, it's OK.
It's...oh, I'm sorry.


449
00:27:54.464 --> 00:27:56.182
Is he gonna be OK?

450
00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:58.306
Um, yeah, it's just a...it's
just a small burn.


451
00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.904
I...I just need to get it cleaned
up.


452
00:27:59.928 --> 00:28:01.528
Janice, you've got your hands full here.

453
00:28:01.721 --> 00:28:03.721
We'll just do this another time.
Oh, no, no, no.


454
00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.771
The caregiver...she'll be here
any minute now.


455
00:28:05.976 --> 00:28:07.336
Janice, I'm covered in hot coffee,

456
00:28:07.477 --> 00:28:09.275
and he's going fucking ape-shit.

457
00:28:09.479 --> 00:28:10.479
We'll do it another time.

458
00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.149
Well, when?

459
00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:14.359
I don't know.
W-we'll do lunch this week.


460
00:28:14.567 --> 00:28:16.444
I'll call you.

461
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:17.700
OK, call me.

462
00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:20.453
I'm just gonna let myself out.

463
00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:23.911
Call me, Charles!

464
00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:26.042
It's OK! It's OK!

465
00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:28.214
Jakob! Damn it, stop it!

466
00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:29.507
Just stop that!

467
00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.882
Can't you see I'm trying to help you?

468
00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:34.713
What is wrong with you?!

469
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:40.428
Why do you always fuck things up?

470
00:28:40.635 --> 00:28:43.764
Oh, come here.
Get over here. Come over here.


471
00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:46.225
Oh, baby.

472
00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:47.525
Oh, you're hurt.

473
00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:49.945
It's OK, though. It's OK.

474
00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:52.364
Mommy's gonna make it better.

475
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.532
Mommy's gonna make it better,

476
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:57.407
Jakey.
No, no, no, no, babe.


477
00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.829
There, there. It's gonna be OK, Jakob.

478
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.328
Look at mommy.
It's gonna be OK, Jakob.


479
00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:07.663
Look at mommy.
It's gonna be OK.


480
00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:11.341
It's OK.

481
00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:17.430
Oh, Jakob.

482
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.351
I'm so sorry.

483
00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:26.808
I know you...I know it wasn't
your fault.


484
00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:32.647
I just wanted tonight to go better.

485
00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:39.406
Oh.

486
00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:18.445
Give me that.

487
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.995
No.
It's my turn.


488
00:30:22.195 --> 00:30:26.496
Come on.

489
00:30:26.699 --> 00:30:28.747
There you go.

490
00:30:55.645 --> 00:30:58.444
Stop it. Ja...Jakob. Jakob.

491
00:30:58.648 --> 00:30:59.648
Jakob. Jakob.

492
00:30:59.774 --> 00:31:00.876
Quit it. Come on.
Jakob. Wake up.


493
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.698
Jakob, quit it.
Quit it.


494
00:31:02.902 --> 00:31:04.370
Jakob.
Wake up.


495
00:31:04.571 --> 00:31:07.370
Jakob.
Jakob.


496
00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:09.668
Jakob.

497
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.621
Jakob.

498
00:31:12.829 --> 00:31:15.207
Jakob, can you hear anything?

499
00:31:15.415 --> 00:31:19.886
Jakob. Can you hear us?

500
00:31:20.086 --> 00:31:23.260
Jakob.
Keep breathing for me.


501
00:31:23.464 --> 00:31:27.844
Keep breathing.

502
00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:32.728
Jakob, can you hear us?

503
00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:38.484
Keep breathing for me.
Keep breathing, Jakob.


504
00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:42.067
Keep breathing.

505
00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:43.492
Hang in there, Jakob.

506
00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:47.072
Just keep breathing for us, OK?

507
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:53.128
Keep breathing.

508
00:33:51.654 --> 00:33:55.750
Jakob.

509
00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:00.251
Jakob.

510
00:34:00.455 --> 00:34:04.835
Oh, Jakob.

511
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:09.048
It...it's your mother.

512
00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:11.678
You're OK.

513
00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:14.056
Jakob!

514
00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.854
Somebody! Jakob!

515
00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:19.649
Somebody help! It's...

516
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:22.102
Jakob?

517
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.483
Jakob, are you with me?

518
00:34:24.687 --> 00:34:27.691
Jakob.

519
00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.822
Jakob, it says here that you cannot speak.

520
00:34:30.026 --> 00:34:32.495
Is that correct?

521
00:34:32.695 --> 00:34:35.665
I guess so.

522
00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:37.333
Let me put it in a different way.

523
00:34:37.533 --> 00:34:38.830
Is there any way that you can

524
00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:40.787
convey to me why you think it is

525
00:34:40.995 --> 00:34:43.339
that you cannot speak?

526
00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:46.088
Jakob.

527
00:34:46.292 --> 00:34:49.592
You know, I'm pretty familiar
with your condition, and I'm


528
00:34:49.796 --> 00:34:53.846
fairly certain that you can understand me.

529
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.680
So, look, Jakob, you're here for
an evaluation so that we may


530
00:34:57.887 --> 00:35:00.561
determine the type of care that you require.

531
00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:02.563
Now, in order to do that, I need

532
00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:05.737
you to participate to
the best of your abilities.

533
00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:09.737
Jakob. Hey, Jakob. Hey, buddy.

534
00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:14.367
What this means is...I want you
to listen and try to perform a


535
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.369
few tasks to the best of your ability.

536
00:35:17.573 --> 00:35:19.792
We'll just start at the bottom

537
00:35:19.992 --> 00:35:21.960
and we'll work our way up.

538
00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:27.543
Now, what I have here is a
simple puzzle which, when put


539
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.175
together correctly, creates a shape.

540
00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:33.882
What do you think?

541
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.263
Jakob. Pay attention now.

542
00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:36.808
Jakob.

543
00:35:37.009 --> 00:35:42.561
Jakob, you want to try and put
these pieces together?


544
00:35:42.765 --> 00:35:44.859
Jakob, it's OK.

545
00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:47.278
Can you just try?

546
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.866
Jakob, mommy asked you a question.

547
00:35:59.073 --> 00:36:02.748
Jakob. Jakob?

548
00:36:02.952 --> 00:36:08.550
I'm talking to you.

549
00:36:08.749 --> 00:36:12.424
I just need someone to come over
a few days a week, keep him busy


550
00:36:12.628 --> 00:36:14.756
so I can have some time to myself.

551
00:36:14.964 --> 00:36:17.934
Do you think that's something
that you could handle?


552
00:36:18.134 --> 00:36:20.557
Yes, I think so.

553
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:22.763
Do you mind if I ask what's...

554
00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:26.977
What his condition is?

555
00:36:27.185 --> 00:36:29.062
Um, he fucks things up.

556
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:31.193
He always fucks things up.

557
00:36:31.397 --> 00:36:33.570
Jakob! Don't you run away
from me, boy!


558
00:36:33.774 --> 00:36:35.367
You hear me?!
Daniel, please.


559
00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:37.616
Don't you fucking go near him, woman!

560
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.197
Daniel, please don't hit him.

561
00:36:39.405 --> 00:36:40.952
You know he can't help himself.

562
00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:43.000
I'm so sick of hearing that shit!

563
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:44.874
I'm sick of all of this shit!

564
00:36:45.077 --> 00:36:47.796
Not my son.
My son could talk and my son was


565
00:36:47.997 --> 00:36:50.375
normal, not some freakin' mute retard!

566
00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:51.926
Talk, god damn it! Talk!

567
00:36:52.126 --> 00:36:53.218
No, he can't, Daniel.

568
00:36:53.419 --> 00:36:54.420
Daniel, Daniel!

569
00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:56.131
Bullshit he can't! He won't!

570
00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:57.135
Stop it!

571
00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.013
Oh, he's gonna talk, all right.

572
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.218
Stop it!

573
00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:01.904
Don't you go near him or I'll
knock your fucking teeth in!


574
00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:02.928
You stop it!

575
00:37:03.012 --> 00:37:04.514
You're gonna say something!

576
00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:05.814
Oh! Oh, my god!

577
00:37:06.015 --> 00:37:08.063
Oh, Jake. Jakey, are you OK?

578
00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:11.066
Come on, sweetheart.
It's...it's OK.


579
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.988
Shh, shh, shh. Don't worry.

580
00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:14.907
Come on. Jakob, it's all right.

581
00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:17.906
Come on, I just need to get
you...wash it off.


582
00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.862
Come on, Jake.

583
00:38:32.393 --> 00:38:34.646
It's OK.

584
00:38:34.854 --> 00:38:37.698
It's really good.

585
00:38:37.898 --> 00:38:40.868
Shh.

586
00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:47.959
That's it.
I'm not gonna hurt you, OK?


587
00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.752
I'm gonna hurt you.

588
00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:24.903
Hello?

589
00:39:24.945 --> 00:39:27.289
Um, hi. Is this ms.Trimble?

590
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.912
Yes. Who's this?

591
00:39:29.116 --> 00:39:32.120
Hi. My name is, um,
Paige Alexander.


592
00:39:32.328 --> 00:39:34.501
I'm calling about your flier.

593
00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:42.705
Oh, yes. Uh, hi.
Uh, could you hold on a sec?


594
00:39:44.757 --> 00:39:46.304
Uh, OK, hi.

595
00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:51.015
Hi. Is the caregiver position
still available?


596
00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:53.816
Oh, yes. Uh-huh.
Where'd you see the flier?


597
00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:55.017
At the school here.

598
00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:55.977
Paxton?

599
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:56.526
Yes.

600
00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:57.228
Uh-huh.

601
00:39:57.436 --> 00:39:58.858
Are you a student there?

602
00:39:59.063 --> 00:39:59.564
Uh-huh.

603
00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:00.772
OK, well...

604
00:40:01.273 --> 00:40:03.367
...do you want to come over for
an interview?


605
00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:06.195
Sure. Now?

606
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:08.077
Yes. Is that a problem?

607
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.749
No. No, it isn't.

608
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:15.205
Let me get your address.
Hold on.


609
00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:26.136
Hi.

610
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.011
Hi.

611
00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:28.217
You Paige?

612
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:29.723
Yes. Hello.

613
00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:30.927
OK.

614
00:40:31.053 --> 00:40:32.521
Um, come on in.

615
00:40:32.722 --> 00:40:36.022
Thanks.

616
00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:40.105
Just come on in here and, oh,

617
00:40:40.312 --> 00:40:41.313
have a seat.

618
00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:42.273
Hello.

619
00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:47.157
Uh, this is my son, Jakob.

620
00:40:47.361 --> 00:40:50.080
Hello, Jakob. I'm Paige.

621
00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:56.709
Um...Jake doesn't speak.

622
00:40:56.912 --> 00:40:59.085
Oh, is this...this is who

623
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.543
you have, um, the flier up for.

624
00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:04.721
Yes. Is that OK?

625
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.046
Yeah, absolutely.

626
00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:07.598
I...I just...

627
00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:11.473
...I think I just expected
someone a lot younger or older.


628
00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:15.272
Well, disability has nothing to do with age.

629
00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:18.226
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

630
00:41:18.434 --> 00:41:19.060
How old is he?

631
00:41:19.268 --> 00:41:20.815
26. How old are you?

632
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.021
21.

633
00:41:22.229 --> 00:41:23.526
Mm-hmm.

634
00:41:23.731 --> 00:41:26.325
And you say you go to Paxton.

635
00:41:26.525 --> 00:41:30.246
Yes, I do.
I'm a senior there, and I am a


636
00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:32.164
sociology major.

637
00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:37.291
Uh-huh. Our last caregiver
went to Paxton.


638
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:39.543
Oh, did they...they
graduate?


639
00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:40.339
Mnh...mnh.

640
00:41:40.539 --> 00:41:41.791
Just didn't work out.

641
00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:42.295
Oh.

642
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.299
Do you have any experience in
in-home care?


643
00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:48.302
Actually, no, not with
in-home care, but I do have my


644
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:50.600
CNA license.
I do that in the summers.


645
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.806
OK. And why are you
interested in this job now?


646
00:41:56.013 --> 00:41:57.013
Um...

647
00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.188
I, uh...I would like to be a

648
00:42:00.392 --> 00:42:02.770
social worker fora
senior-living facility or


649
00:42:02.978 --> 00:42:03.979
possibly a hospital.

650
00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:07.112
And I'm also applying to grad
school, and I think that this


651
00:42:07.316 --> 00:42:10.570
experience could be very valuable for me.

652
00:42:10.778 --> 00:42:12.155
Uh-huh. Well, what I'm

653
00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:14.240
looking for is for someone to

654
00:42:14.448 --> 00:42:17.918
come in a few days a week, three
or four hours at a time.


655
00:42:18.118 --> 00:42:21.793
I work part time, and I just
have some things I have to do.


656
00:42:21.997 --> 00:42:26.423
I just need someone to be here
with him, feed him, if it's


657
00:42:26.627 --> 00:42:29.551
nice out, take him outside, if it
gets late, put him to bed,


658
00:42:29.755 --> 00:42:31.257
basically just be here with him

659
00:42:31.465 --> 00:42:35.515
so I can have some time to myself.

660
00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:36.185
OK.

661
00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:40.062
So, do you think this is
something you could handle?


662
00:42:40.266 --> 00:42:42.485
Yes.

663
00:42:42.685 --> 00:42:46.280
Um...does anyone else take care
of him?


664
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.155
My sister sometimes, but it's
starting to be too much for her.


665
00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:53.954
Plus, her husband just got laid
off, and they might be moving


666
00:42:54.154 --> 00:42:59.285
to, uh, fort Wayne for more work.

667
00:42:59.493 --> 00:43:02.292
OK.

668
00:43:02.496 --> 00:43:06.342
Do you mind if I
ask what is his disability?

669
00:43:06.542 --> 00:43:08.544
He has anoxic brain injury.

670
00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:11.221
It occurs when there's a severe

671
00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:15.097
lack of oxygen to the brain.

672
00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:15.517
Mm.

673
00:43:15.718 --> 00:43:18.221
Jakob had an accident when he was 12.

674
00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:22.855
Hit his head.
He was in a coma for a month.


675
00:43:23.058 --> 00:43:30.237
When he came out, he
slowly started to fade away.

676
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.318
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

677
00:43:32.526 --> 00:43:36.030
Anyway, I don't think he'll be any trouble.

678
00:43:36.238 --> 00:43:38.491
Like I said, he doesn't speak,

679
00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:42.454
but he seems to understand most things.

680
00:43:42.661 --> 00:43:44.755
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

681
00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:48.960
See?
Mostly, he just sits there, and


682
00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:50.715
he'll do what you tell him.

683
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.299
Just take him out once in a while.

684
00:43:54.506 --> 00:44:02.106
He seems to like it outside.

685
00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.307
Um, OK, great.

686
00:44:03.515 --> 00:44:05.017
When would you like me to start?

687
00:44:05.225 --> 00:44:05.817
Tomorrow.

688
00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:09.192
If that's OK.

689
00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:12.445
I'm pretty ready fora break.

690
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:13.025
OK.

691
00:44:13.233 --> 00:44:14.359
Well, that sounds great.

692
00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:17.242
I can definitely do that.

693
00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:18.823
OK. Thank you, Paige.

694
00:44:19.031 --> 00:44:20.123
Thank you so much.

695
00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:22.372
Bye, Jakob.
I'll see you tomorrow.


696
00:44:22.576 --> 00:44:23.623
OK, I'll take...

697
00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.374
Do you need anything else?

698
00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:27.297
No, I'm fine, thank you.

699
00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:33.096
I could use some more coffee, please.

700
00:44:33.295 --> 00:44:36.720
So, what do you know about these people?

701
00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:37.924
What people?

702
00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:40.345
People you're gonna be working for.

703
00:44:40.552 --> 00:44:42.099
Mm...not much.

704
00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:44.306
I just met them yesterday.

705
00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:46.893
Well, what's he like?

706
00:44:47.101 --> 00:44:50.480
He has a brain
injury, so he can't talk.

707
00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:53.908
Just seems really innocent.

708
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:55.109
I don't know, Paige.

709
00:44:55.317 --> 00:44:59.413
I don't understand why you feel
like you have to do this.


710
00:44:59.613 --> 00:45:03.538
Well, I'm gonna have to do it
at some point, considering


711
00:45:03.742 --> 00:45:05.540
that's what I'm going to school for.

712
00:45:05.744 --> 00:45:08.304
And, plus, it'll look really good
on my grad-school application.


713
00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:14.338
I know. It's just...not the best neighborhood.

714
00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:15.341
Mom.

715
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:18.095
All right, I am off.

716
00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:20.266
And what do you think about all this?

717
00:45:20.467 --> 00:45:22.469
She's right.
It'll be a good learning


718
00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:25.397
experience, and, well, it can't
hurt her to make a little money


719
00:45:25.597 --> 00:45:27.349
for next year.
Just be careful.


720
00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:30.107
Don't get too involved, you
know, keep it professional.


721
00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.562
Believe it or not, you guys,

722
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:33.363
I kind of know what I'm doing.

723
00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:34.315
All right.

724
00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:37.447
She knows what she's doing.
We'll see you tonight.


725
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:39.528
Bye.

726
00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:30.580
Oh, hi. Come on in.

727
00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:36.591
Have to finish getting ready.

728
00:46:36.794 --> 00:46:39.513
Well, you look nice.
Big plans?


729
00:46:39.713 --> 00:46:41.841
Actually, I have a date.

730
00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:44.389
Uh, first date.

731
00:46:44.593 --> 00:46:46.721
Oh, wow. Who's the lucky guy?

732
00:46:46.929 --> 00:46:50.775
Oh, his name is Charles.

733
00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:54.069
I met him in the
parking lot where I work.

734
00:46:54.269 --> 00:46:58.240
I backed my car into his shopping cart.

735
00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:02.365
And I guess he liked what he
saw, and he asked me out.


736
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:03.569
Well, that's great.

737
00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:06.373
I hope you guys
have a really good time.

738
00:47:06.573 --> 00:47:10.248
Oh. I hope so, too.

739
00:47:10.452 --> 00:47:16.130
I haven't been out
in such a long time.

740
00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:18.427
Is he picking you up?

741
00:47:18.627 --> 00:47:20.675
Yes, any minute now.
Why?


742
00:47:20.879 --> 00:47:23.723
I thought I saw someone parked outside.

743
00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:24.516
What?!

744
00:47:24.716 --> 00:47:27.560
Why didn't you say something?

745
00:47:27.761 --> 00:47:30.856
Oh.

746
00:47:31.056 --> 00:47:33.479
Oh, shit! That's him!

747
00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:36.483
Ooh!

748
00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:38.655
Well, don't worry about anything here.

749
00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:39.527
I'm sure we'll be fine.

750
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:42.575
OK, uh, he's, um, upstairs

751
00:47:42.776 --> 00:47:44.870
in his bedroom.

752
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.070
I, uh...

753
00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:48.574
OK. Do I look all right?

754
00:47:48.782 --> 00:47:50.500
Good, really good.

755
00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:52.123
OK. Night.

756
00:47:52.327 --> 00:47:53.954
Good luck.

757
00:48:06.675 --> 00:48:08.643
Hi, Jakob.

758
00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:16.777
Are you hungry?

759
00:48:23.358 --> 00:48:24.655
Guess I should have asked your

760
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.363
mom if you like pizza, huh?

761
00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.879
Do you want some?

762
00:48:45.797 --> 00:48:48.016
<i>Maybe we should play a game.</i>

763
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:05.655
<i>Yeah, let's go play a game.</i>

764
00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:16.253
All right.

765
00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:19.627
You want to be yellow?

766
00:49:19.831 --> 00:49:22.755
And then I'll be red, OK?

767
00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:30.551
Let's see.

768
00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:32.352
Did you get all yellow?

769
00:49:32.552 --> 00:49:33.724
Let me see.

770
00:49:33.929 --> 00:49:36.933
Oh, very good.

771
00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.859
Here you go.

772
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:46.614
All right.

773
00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:49.866
All right, so, 
I'm gonna put in one piece.

774
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:54.792
No, you're yellow.
I'm red, Jakob, see?


775
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:56.790
All right, now I'm gonna put in

776
00:49:56.994 --> 00:50:04.628
one piece, and then you're gonna
put in one piece.


777
00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.133
OK.

778
00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:09.681
Now, don't let me
get four in a row.

779
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:12.100
I don't want to have four reds

780
00:50:12.301 --> 00:50:14.599
next to each other.

781
00:50:26.898 --> 00:50:29.117
Nice strategy there.

782
00:50:29.318 --> 00:50:31.195
That's pretty good.

783
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:41.547
All right, well, let's play another round.

784
00:50:45.917 --> 00:50:48.921
You know how? Here.

785
00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:18.826
No. For you.

786
00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:37.136
That's probably way too much.

787
00:52:00.075 --> 00:52:01.827
Done?

788
00:52:09.918 --> 00:52:13.422
All right. There we go.

789
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.884
Sorry.

790
00:52:17.092 --> 00:52:19.140
OK, arms up.

791
00:52:37.154 --> 00:52:38.154
Oh, my god.

792
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:45.254
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Where'd you get that?


793
00:52:45.454 --> 00:52:46.797
That looks like it hurts.

794
00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:49.876
Here, here. Sorry.

795
00:52:50.083 --> 00:52:51.926
There.

796
00:53:03.805 --> 00:53:06.809
Sorry.

797
00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.894
OK.

798
00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:18.320
OK. OK.

799
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:26.795
Hi.

800
00:53:26.995 --> 00:53:28.838
Hey.

801
00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.256
How'd it go?

802
00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:32.300
Great. Just great.

803
00:53:32.501 --> 00:53:34.720
Ah, I really needed that.

804
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.920
Good.

805
00:53:35.962 --> 00:53:37.305
Is he in bed?

806
00:53:37.506 --> 00:53:37.972
Yeah.

807
00:53:38.173 --> 00:53:40.016
Yeah, we actually had a really good night.

808
00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:42.720
I ordered pizza, but he didn't
really seem to like it much.


809
00:53:42.928 --> 00:53:44.976
Yeah, he doesn't like pizza real well.

810
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.853
Didn't you use his pecs book?

811
00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.057
His what?

812
00:53:48.225 --> 00:53:53.903
This.

813
00:53:54.105 --> 00:53:57.075
You just have him put a picture
of what he wants on the cover so


814
00:53:57.275 --> 00:54:01.030
you know what it is. You
didn't use this at all tonight?


815
00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:02.956
No, I didn't know you had it.

816
00:54:03.156 --> 00:54:04.999
Well, he doesn't speak, honey.

817
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.873
What'd you think we used?

818
00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:12.077
Um, I don't know. But I'll
definitely use it from now on.


819
00:54:19.506 --> 00:54:22.806
Um, also, I wanted to let you
know that when I was putting him


820
00:54:23.009 --> 00:54:25.011
to bed, I saw a
huge bruise on his side.

821
00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:27.598
Yeah, that boy's always getting banged up.

822
00:54:27.806 --> 00:54:29.900
He doesn't mean to be so
self-destructive.


823
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.192
He just can't help himself.

824
00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:33.111
Nothing to get all worked up about.

825
00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:36.190
All right, well, just wanted
to make sure you were aware.


826
00:54:36.398 --> 00:54:38.901
Well, thank you.

827
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.361
Uh...good night.

828
00:54:40.569 --> 00:54:42.071
See you soon.

829
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:42.950
Uh-huh.

830
00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:44.827
Good night.

831
00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:42.983
Hey, you are here.

832
00:56:43.191 --> 00:56:43.612
Hey.

833
00:56:43.817 --> 00:56:45.990
I thought you had class today.

834
00:56:46.194 --> 00:56:47.741
Um, it was canceled.

835
00:56:47.946 --> 00:56:49.414
Oh, well, that's nice.

836
00:56:49.614 --> 00:56:51.912
What you working on?

837
00:56:52.117 --> 00:56:54.119
Nothing.
Just some school stuff.


838
00:56:54.327 --> 00:56:55.327
Have you eaten yet?

839
00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:57.080
No, but I have to be at the

840
00:56:57.288 --> 00:56:59.006
Trimbles' in about two hours, so...

841
00:56:59.207 --> 00:57:01.255
Oh, well, it won't take that long.

842
00:57:01.459 --> 00:57:02.711
Let's go have some lunch.

843
00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:04.592
All right, I'll be right down.

844
00:57:04.796 --> 00:57:10.769
OK.

845
00:57:10.969 --> 00:57:12.266
This OK for you?

846
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:15.223
It's fine.

847
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:18.026
Jimmy's going to be
taking care of you today.

848
00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:20.524
Can I get some drinks
to start with for you?

849
00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:22.106
I'll have an iced tea.

850
00:57:22.313 --> 00:57:22.905
Iced tea.

851
00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.232
Did you want a sweetener?

852
00:57:24.441 --> 00:57:25.237
No.

853
00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:26.238
And you?

854
00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:28.116
Um...diet coke.

855
00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:29.662
Is Pepsi OK?

856
00:57:29.863 --> 00:57:30.364
Sure.

857
00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:31.073
OK.

858
00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:32.999
I'll get those right out.

859
00:57:33.199 --> 00:57:35.247
Thank you.

860
00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:39.582
Well, this is nice. I feel
like I never see you anymore.


861
00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:41.291
Mom, I see you every day.

862
00:57:41.499 --> 00:57:45.174
Well, five minutes in the
morning, five minutes at night.


863
00:57:45.378 --> 00:57:48.757
That's not really seeing each other.

864
00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:51.889
Well, I have school and, um,

865
00:57:52.093 --> 00:57:54.061
a job, so...
I know, I know.


866
00:57:54.262 --> 00:57:57.311
It's just...next thing you know, you'll be

867
00:57:57.515 --> 00:58:01.770
off to grad school.

868
00:58:01.978 --> 00:58:04.481
We gonna talk about this now?

869
00:58:04.689 --> 00:58:07.238
No. No, we're not.

870
00:58:07.442 --> 00:58:10.491
We'll talk about something else.

871
00:58:10.695 --> 00:58:13.448
So, how are things going with, uh, Jakob?

872
00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:16.580
Really good.
Um...it's kind of hard working


873
00:58:16.785 --> 00:58:19.163
with him sometimes because he can't talk.

874
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:21.247
Sometimes, it's really frustrating.

875
00:58:21.456 --> 00:58:24.300
But I really feel like I'm kind
of connecting with him.


876
00:58:24.501 --> 00:58:26.378
I think it's going really well.

877
00:58:26.586 --> 00:58:28.509
I don't know how you do that.

878
00:58:28.713 --> 00:58:31.136
It takes a special kind of person.

879
00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:36.893
I think you just need patience.

880
00:58:37.096 --> 00:58:40.851
So, what's she like, the mom?

881
00:58:41.059 --> 00:58:43.027
She's really nice.

882
00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:46.528
She's kind of strict, but I

883
00:58:46.731 --> 00:58:47.903
guess you have to be?

884
00:58:48.107 --> 00:58:51.907
She's kind of wrapped up with
this guy that she's seeing right now.


885
00:58:52.111 --> 00:58:52.737
Really?

886
00:58:52.946 --> 00:58:54.664
Is the father around at all?

887
00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:56.207
No.

888
00:58:56.407 --> 00:58:59.832
She hasn't really mentioned it,
either, so I can't ask her about it.


889
00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:01.663
No.

890
00:59:13.174 --> 00:59:16.303
Kind of feel like...

891
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:20.311
It must be...really hard not

892
00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:23.940
being able to talk to people and
communicate with them.


893
00:59:24.143 --> 00:59:26.771
He must feel really alone.

894
00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:30.484
And he's so vulnerable.

895
00:59:30.692 --> 00:59:36.699
Sometimes, I feel like I'm just
working with a 5-year-old.


896
00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:40.285
And his mom is really nice.

897
00:59:40.493 --> 00:59:43.918
I just feel like...if she was

898
00:59:44.122 --> 00:59:48.878
more patient with him that he would understand.

899
00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:51.713
Sometimes...I probably
shouldn't say anything.


900
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:54.174
She's so strict with him, you know?

901
00:59:54.382 --> 00:59:55.382
I don't know.

902
00:59:55.508 --> 01:00:00.514
I just wish I could be there
more or do more to help.


903
01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:03.896
Here you go.
Iced tea and a diet Pepsi.


904
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.319
Jimmy should be right with you.

905
01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:10.365
Thank you.

906
01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:15.287
Honey...

907
01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:17.409
This is their lives.

908
01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:21.369
I know you feel like you've
spent some time with them, but


909
01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:29.336
it's only been a few months. You
don't really know these people.


910
01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:31.215
Now, I think your father was right.

911
01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:34.389
I don't think you should get too involved.

912
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:38.560
Just do your job, get the
experience you need, and then


913
01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.760
you'll just move on.

914
01:00:39.844 --> 01:00:41.437
How are you ladies doing today?

915
01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:42.104
Fine.

916
01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:44.649
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Are you ready to order?


917
01:00:44.849 --> 01:00:45.395
Yes.

918
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.978
Yes, I think so.
What can I get for you?


919
01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:50.280
I will have the bolognese.

920
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.480
OK.

921
01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.529
And what...what is...

922
01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.283
Jakob. Jakob, stop it!
Just stop that!


923
01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:38.032
Can't you see I'm trying to help?!

924
01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:39.704
What is wrong with you?!

925
01:01:39.904 --> 01:01:43.499
Why do you always
have to fuck things up?!

926
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.374
Jakob, get over here!

927
01:01:46.577 --> 01:01:48.295
Jakob, get over here!

928
01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:50.590
Get over here!

929
01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:18.531
You're late.
I'm sorry. My class ran over.


930
01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:21.659
OK.
I have to go out for a while.


931
01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:24.036
Get the door, please.

932
01:02:42.383 --> 01:02:47.514
Jakob. Jakob, are you OK?

933
01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:53.691
Jakob, it's me...Paige.

934
01:03:02.403 --> 01:03:04.371
Jakob, it's OK.

935
01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:06.620
It's OK. Shh, shh.

936
01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:08.542
It's me...Paige.

937
01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:10.711
It's me, OK?

938
01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:16.544
It's OK. It's OK.

939
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.549
Come on, let's get up off the

940
01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:22.474
floor, OK?
OK? Come on.


941
01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:26.223
It's OK.

942
01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:19.648
There you go.
You look very handsome.


943
01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:50.595
Jakob...

944
01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:58.187
Jakob, I need you
to focus on me, OK?

945
01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.396
Is your mom hitting you, Jakob?

946
01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:02.653
Jakob, I need you to look at me,

947
01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:03.949
OK?

948
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.323
I need to know.

949
01:05:06.527 --> 01:05:08.279
Does your mom hurt you, Jakob?

950
01:05:08.487 --> 01:05:13.960
Does your mom hurt you? Huh?

951
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:20.714
You can tell me.

952
01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:24.046
OK.

953
01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:26.722
Thank you.

954
01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.103
OK.

955
01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:35.523
All right, let's get to bed.

956
01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.270
Come on.

957
01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:46.901
OK. Good night.

958
01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:27.775
I'm home now, Paige.
You can leave.


959
01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.911
Um...I just wanted to talk

960
01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:36.493
to you about something.

961
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:37.702
Yeah? What's that?

962
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:41.585
Um, it just seems like most
of the time that I take care of


963
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:46.590
Jakob, I find some kind of...bruises
or marks on him somewhere.


964
01:06:46.794 --> 01:06:51.049
And tonight, on his arm, he had...

965
01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.762
Paige, honey, I've already
told you that people with his


966
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.189
condition have these random fits of aggression.

967
01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:01.609
Those fits, most of the time,
result in him getting banged up,


968
01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:05.234
and there's really nothing you
or I or anyone can do about it,


969
01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:10.114
aside from chaining the boy to a wall.

970
01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:14.243
Every time I've ever watched
him, I've never once seen him


971
01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:18.077
hurt himself in any way.

972
01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.878
Just because you spend a few
hours a week with him doesn't


973
01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:23.627
mean you understand everything
about his condition.


974
01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:27.461
I have been living with this
shit for 15 years, and believe


975
01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:30.217
me...you have no idea what it
can be like.


976
01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:32.719
I understand that.
But I just...


977
01:07:32.923 --> 01:07:35.767
Paige, I don't like
where you're going with this.

978
01:07:35.968 --> 01:07:41.896
Is there something you want to ask me?

979
01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:43.942
No.

980
01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:47.898
No, I...no.

981
01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:50.779
I just...I really care about

982
01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:54.408
him, and I hate to see him in

983
01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:55.909
any kind of pain.

984
01:07:57.656 --> 01:07:59.909
Well, that makes two of us.

985
01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:08.091
OK.

986
01:08:08.292 --> 01:08:10.044
Good night.

987
01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:41.348
Adult protective services.
How can I help you?


988
01:09:41.552 --> 01:09:43.725
Hi.

989
01:09:43.929 --> 01:09:46.773
Um, I..I'd like to report a
possible abuse.


990
01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:51.859
OK. What is your name?

991
01:09:52.062 --> 01:09:54.690
Do I have to say?

992
01:09:54.899 --> 01:10:00.201
No, not at this time, but we
may eventually need to know.


993
01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:02.782
OK.

994
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:10.374
What can you tell
me about the alleged victim?

995
01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:14.381
Um...he has a condition, so

996
01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:18.055
I'm not...I'm not totally sure

997
01:10:18.255 --> 01:10:19.723
that he's being abused.

998
01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:23.474
That's OK. I understand.
If you have a suspicion, then


999
01:10:23.677 --> 01:10:26.146
you are doing the right thing by calling.

1000
01:10:31.268 --> 01:10:35.068
Now, what makes you think this
person is being abused?


1001
01:10:35.272 --> 01:10:37.115
Well, I've seen marks on them

1002
01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:42.322
...bruises, um, scratches
around their wrist.


1003
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.999
OK. Have you ever actually

1004
01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:49.545
seen this person being physically abused?

1005
01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.463
No, not really.

1006
01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:58.179
OK, is there anyone else that
might have seen this happening?


1007
01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:00.052
I don't...I don't know.

1008
01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:02.258
I don't...I really don't think
so.


1009
01:11:05.135 --> 01:11:12.940
Do you have any idea who may
be causing the abuse?


1010
01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:17.068
Um...

1011
01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:21.699
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but these
are questions I have to ask.


1012
01:11:21.902 --> 01:11:28.410
I know this is scary, but I have to get
some kind of information from you.


1013
01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:32.622
Now, can you at least tell
me the name of the person

1014
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:38.837
that you believe is being abused?

1015
01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:40.044
Ma'am?

1016
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.030
Hello?

1017
01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:10.706
Oh, hi, Paige. It's Janice.

1018
01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:12.627
Hey.

1019
01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:14.250
Look, um, the other night...

1020
01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:17.129
I hope you didn't take anything
I said the wrong way.


1021
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.961
I really do appreciate all the
help you've given us.


1022
01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:26.051
It's just when it comes to my
Jakob, I can be real protective.


1023
01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:28.386
No, no. I...I understand.

1024
01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.938
Good, good.

1025
01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:33.766
Now, the...the reason I'm
calling, and I know it's short


1026
01:12:33.974 --> 01:12:37.524
notice, but Charles wants to take
me out to lunch this afternoon.


1027
01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:44.077
Um, is there any way you could
be here in, say, uh, an hour?


1028
01:12:44.276 --> 01:12:47.655
Um...

1029
01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:49.911
Yeah, sure.
That's fine, no problem.


1030
01:12:50.115 --> 01:12:51.662
Oh, OK.

1031
01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.136
Well, I need to start getting ready, then.

1032
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.161
OK, ms. Trim...

1033
01:13:27.027 --> 01:13:29.200
he's in his bedroom.

1034
01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:28.426
That looks really nice.

1035
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:36.104
Can we put this away now?

1036
01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.307
Come on.

1037
01:14:57.034 --> 01:15:01.835
OK. Jakob...

1038
01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:05.760
Jakob...look at me.

1039
01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:09.259
I'm gonna...

1040
01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:11.591
It's gonna be OK, all right?

1041
01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:14.393
It's gonna be OK.

1042
01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:16.891
I'm just gonna...

1043
01:15:17.095 --> 01:15:20.725
Gonna be safe now, OK?

1044
01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:23.311
It'll be OK now.

1045
01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.959
It's gonna be OK, OK?

1046
01:15:43.163 --> 01:15:47.213
It's gonna be OK.

1047
01:15:56.176 --> 01:15:57.268
It's OK.

1048
01:15:57.469 --> 01:16:01.975
It's gonna be OK.

1049
01:16:02.182 --> 01:16:04.651
It's gonna be OK.

1050
01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:07.321
Shh, shh.

1051
01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:09.194
Look at me, Jakob.

1052
01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:27.408
It's gonna be OK.
You're OK. Shh.


1053
01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:35.382
That's good, that's good.

1054
01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.184
It's OK. You're OK.

1055
01:16:37.384 --> 01:16:39.432
You're doing really well.

1056
01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:41.638
You're doing really well.

1057
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:14.750
OK.
That's good, that's good.


1058
01:19:24.676 --> 01:19:26.599
I'm so sorry about this.

1059
01:19:26.803 --> 01:19:29.522
Just stand up with me, OK?

1060
01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:33.569
Come here. Come here. Come here.

1061
01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.521
OK. You're really good.
I'm so sorry.


1062
01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:38.528
Just one more thing, OK?
Just one more thing, and you're


1063
01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:46.732
gonna be safe.
Come on.


1064
01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:50.415
It's OK. It's OK.
Just one more thing.


1065
01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:54.214
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.


1066
01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:38.166
What is it?

1067
01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.048
Don't fucking touch me!

1068
01:20:40.252 --> 01:20:41.595
Where's Jakob?!

1069
01:22:04.294 --> 01:22:06.763
Take your bra off, please.

1070
01:22:19.684 --> 01:22:25.407
Arms straight out.

1071
01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:33.536
Turn your face to the right.

1072
01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:36.914
Not your body, just your head.

1073
01:22:38.578 --> 01:22:40.139
OK, scoot all the way down
to the end of the bed.

1074
01:22:40.163 --> 01:22:41.631
Just try to relax, OK?

1075
01:22:41.831 --> 01:22:44.835
You're gonna feel my hands.
Just try and relax. Good.


1076
01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:46.761
All right. Hard speculum, OK?

1077
01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:49.306
And you're gonna feel some pressure.

1078
01:22:49.506 --> 01:22:51.975
Just try to relax. OK.

1079
01:22:52.175 --> 01:22:55.600
OK, just relax.

1080
01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:58.523
And I'm gonna take some samples.

1081
01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:04.651
You'll feel some cramping.

1082
01:23:04.854 --> 01:23:10.327
There's some. Just relax.

1083
01:23:21.538 --> 01:23:26.635
There we go.

1084
01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.258
You can come in now.

1085
01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:39.772
You OK? Comfortable?

1086
01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:43.022
Do you need anything?

1087
01:23:43.226 --> 01:23:46.275
OK. It's been a long day.

1088
01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:04.248
We'll be right downstairs, honey.

1089
01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:06.709
Try to get some rest.

1090
01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:32.492
Paige.

1091
01:24:32.692 --> 01:24:33.692
How's it going?

1092
01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.533
Hey. Good. Good. I'm good.

1093
01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.614
We didn't know you were back.

1094
01:24:37.822 --> 01:24:39.620
Yeah, I just...I just got
back.


1095
01:24:39.824 --> 01:24:40.575
Are you OK?

1096
01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:41.784
Yeah, I'm fine.

1097
01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:42.622
Yeah?

1098
01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:47.503
When we heard about what
happened, I mean...I just...


1099
01:24:47.707 --> 01:24:49.209
We were just wondering if you

1100
01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.294
would do another girls' night out?

1101
01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:53.676
It'd be a good distraction from everything.

1102
01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.303
Yeah. No, that would be...
It'd be fine.


1103
01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:56.849
OK.

1104
01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:57.721
All right.

1105
01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:58.926
We'll call you.

1106
01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:00.554
Uh, yeah, I'll call you.

1107
01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:01.058
Bye.

1108
01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:06.262
OK, well, see you later,
then...I guess.


1109
01:27:49.013 --> 01:27:50.013
Richmond police de...

1110
01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:27.010
I know you're in there.

1111
01:28:27.218 --> 01:28:30.017
Come on, Paige, open the door.

1112
01:28:30.221 --> 01:28:33.100
Open up, Paige! Open up!

1113
01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:46.996
Hey, look what I did.

1114
01:28:47.196 --> 01:28:49.039
Open the door!

1115
01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.412
Open it up!

1116
01:28:52.368 --> 01:28:53.836
Come on, Paige!

1117
01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:55.710
I'm coming in there!

1118
01:28:55.913 --> 01:28:57.665
I'm coming in for you!

1119
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.300
Janice, Janice, please, I'm so sorry.

1120
01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:05.006
Please. I'm so sorry.

1121
01:29:05.214 --> 01:29:07.012
I don't care.
Janice, please.


1122
01:29:07.216 --> 01:29:08.638
I don't care.
I'm so sorry.


1123
01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:09.935
Aaaah!

1124
01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:16.935
Oh, my god!

1125
01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:19.987
This is what you deserve.

1126
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.157
What?!

1127
01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:40.333
No, you stay back. Stay back!

1128
01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:41.588
Get away from me!

1129
01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:42.965
Aah!

1130
01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:42.358
Hello? Hello? Yes.

1131
01:30:42.562 --> 01:30:44.860
Yes, I...need...
I need someone.

1132
01:30:45.064 --> 01:30:47.783
I need help.
There's somebody in my house,


1133
01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:50.328
and she...
No, she's still here.


1134
01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.030
No, I don't think so.

1135
01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:55.583
I don't think so.
Can you please help me? Please?


1136
01:30:57.243 --> 01:31:00.247
Um...OK.

1137
01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:04.505
I'm at 1134 Fairway Drive.

1138
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:06.427
OK. Thank you so much.

1139
01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:09.050
Please hurry.
