00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:48.894
<i>Today, the glory of ancient Egypt...
is ruins and dust.</i>


2
00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.969
<i>And this greatest of the earth's
earliest civilizations...</i>


3
00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.772
<i>...a thing of darkness
and mystery.</i>


4
00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:00.503
<i>These mighty monuments
tell us of a people...</i>


5
00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:02.638
<i>...who were rulers of the world.</i>

6
00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:06.889
<i>Who created a civilization never surpassed
for beauty and splendor.</i>


7
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.113
<i>But the Egyptians were not only
builders of monuments.</i>


8
00:02:10.813 --> 00:02:13.649
<i>They were human beings,
no different from ourselves.</i>


9
00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:16.752
<i>This is the story of a man...</i>

10
00:02:16.853 --> 00:02:19.088
<i>...who dwelled in the ancient
land of the Nile...</i>


11
00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.657
<i>...thirty-three centuries ago.</i>

12
00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.292
<i>I, Sinuhe the Egyptian...</i>

13
00:02:56.893 --> 00:02:58.661
<i>...write this...</i>

14
00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:06.227
<i>...in my place of exile,
on the shores of the Red Sea.</i>


15
00:03:10.606 --> 00:03:13.309
<i>There is no more
desolate spot on earth.</i>


16
00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:16.479
<i>Soon the jackals
and the vultures...</i>


17
00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.415
<i>...will make a poor meal
of what is left of me.</i>


18
00:03:20.716 --> 00:03:23.386
<i>No monument
will mark my resting place.</i>


19
00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:26.189
<i>I will leave only this.</i>

20
00:03:27.017 --> 00:03:29.199
<i>The story of my life.</i>

21
00:03:30.424 --> 00:03:33.029
<i>I have lived fully and deeply.</i>

22
00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.098
<i>I have tasted passion, crime...</i>

23
00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:38.543
<i>...and even murder.</i>

24
00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.337
<i>It is for you to judge me.</i>

25
00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:44.674
<i>You must weigh the good
against the evil.</i>


26
00:03:45.274 --> 00:03:47.176
<i>The passion
against the tenderness.</i>


27
00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:49.659
<i>The crime against the charity.</i>

28
00:03:49.911 --> 00:03:52.494
<i>The pleasure against the pain.</i>

29
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.996
<i>I began life
as I am ending it, alone.</i>


30
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.722
<i>I rode alone
on the bosom of the Nile...</i>


31
00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:03.471
<i>...in a boat of reeds daubed with pitch
and tied with fowler's knots.</i>


32
00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:07.496
<i>Thus the city of Thebes was accustomed
to dispose of its unwanted children.</i>


33
00:04:36.325 --> 00:04:38.810
<i>I grew up on the waterfront
of the city...</i>


34
00:04:38.814 --> 00:04:40.716
<i>...in the house
of my foster parents...</i>


35
00:04:40.718 --> 00:04:42.525
<i>...who had saved me
from the river.</i>


36
00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:45.461
<i>My foster father
lived there by choice...</i>


37
00:04:45.465 --> 00:04:50.142
<i>...because he was, also by choice,
physician to the poor of the city.</i>


38
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.647
<i>From the rich he could have
commanded princely fees...</i>


39
00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:00.049
<i>...for he alone in Thebes,
was master...</i>


40
00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.742
<i>...of the ancient art
of opening skulls.</i>


41
00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:07.453
Have more of the good wine ready.

42
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.056
Afraid, Sinuhe?

43
00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:25.308
Good.

44
00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.021
You must never fear death.

45
00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:33.313
In our craft death
is a familiar companion.


46
00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:51.276
This time we cheat him.

47
00:05:54.036 --> 00:05:55.292
Look...

48
00:05:55.304 --> 00:05:58.441
...this tiny splinter of bone
pressing on the brain.


49
00:05:59.408 --> 00:06:00.843
When I remove it...

50
00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.161
...he will speak again.

51
00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:07.067
Will walk, and live.

52
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.153
Why father? Why?

53
00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:13.122
No one knows.

54
00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:25.034
<i>From the beginning
I kept to myself.</i>


55
00:06:25.535 --> 00:06:27.870
<i>I used to wander alone
on the banks of the Nile...</i>


56
00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:31.441
<i>...until the day came when I was ready
to enter the School of Life.</i>


57
00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:39.182
<i>In the School of Life...</i>

58
00:06:39.248 --> 00:06:41.818
<i>...were trained the chosen
young men of Egypt.</i>


59
00:06:42.084 --> 00:06:44.287
<i>The future scientists
and philosophers...</i>


60
00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:45.755
<i>...statesmen and generals.</i>

61
00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:49.838
<i>All the learning of Egypt...</i>

62
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.727
<i>...lay in the keeping
of the Gods.</i>


63
00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:56.732
<i>For ten years,
I served them in the school...</i>


64
00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.302
<i>...that I might earn the right
to call myself a "physician."</i>


65
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:04.316
<i>I learned
to bend my body to them...</i>


66
00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:05.816
<i>...but that was all.</i>

67
00:07:05.942 --> 00:07:08.211
<i>My mind still asked the question:</i>

68
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.296
Why?

69
00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:17.920
Sinuhe...

70
00:07:18.387 --> 00:07:20.257
...be careful, the priests!

71
00:07:26.987 --> 00:07:28.599
Free wine!

72
00:07:42.913 --> 00:07:45.281
To the health
of our classmate, Horemheb!


73
00:07:45.782 --> 00:07:47.984
The best swordsman,
the finest horseman...


74
00:07:48.317 --> 00:07:51.535
...the fastest runner,
and the strongest wrestler.


75
00:07:51.687 --> 00:07:53.756
And the first one to tell about it!

76
00:07:54.957 --> 00:07:56.959
Well, if you don't speak
well of yourself...


77
00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:58.394
...no one will do it for you.

78
00:07:58.396 --> 00:07:59.993
This I learned from the gods.

79
00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:05.200
You drunk to what I am...

80
00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:07.336
...now drink to what I will be.

81
00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:10.528
For the day will come,
when I will carry the Golden Whip...


82
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.598
...and lead you all into battle.

83
00:08:17.713 --> 00:08:19.188
Hey, you're not drinking, my friend.

84
00:08:19.388 --> 00:08:22.118
- Wine!
- He's had enough.


85
00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:23.486
Never enough for a friend.

86
00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.788
Finish the night in some gutter
with his throat cut.


87
00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:28.458
He's under my protection.

88
00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:32.728
To your future.

89
00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:42.182
- Look at our brilliant physician!
- The honor student!


90
00:08:44.474 --> 00:08:46.475
He's got the reeling sickness!

91
00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:02.174
Can I help you?

92
00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:09.599
Just a second.
Don't throw things at my friend.


93
00:09:19.842 --> 00:09:21.577
He's alive!

94
00:09:22.378 --> 00:09:23.612
Who is he?

95
00:09:23.615 --> 00:09:25.918
He's a stubborn arrogant fool,
but he is my best friend.


96
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:26.962
Then take him home.

97
00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:29.285
A tavern wench can't give orders
to the son of a Falcon.


98
00:09:29.352 --> 00:09:31.254
The son of a cheese-maker!
Take him home!


99
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.180
Good night physician.

100
00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:39.350
Your friend is the fool, not you.

101
00:09:39.896 --> 00:09:43.387
Why does no one ever answer me
when I ask "why"?


102
00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:47.034
Come on, let's go.

103
00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:55.398
How did she know your father
was a cheese-maker?


104
00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:07.356
<i>The Queen of Cities.</i>

105
00:10:07.358 --> 00:10:09.630
<i>Thebes, of the hundred gates.</i>

106
00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:12.261
<i>Capital of the world.</i>

107
00:10:14.163 --> 00:10:16.232
<i>After my graduation
from the School of Life...</i>


108
00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:18.968
<i>...I set myself up as physician
on the waterfront.</i>


109
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.931
<i>Far from my father's house...</i>

110
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:23.039
<i>...lest I steal
his patients from him.</i>


111
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:31.447
<i>But I found that not even
the poorest of patients...</i>


112
00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:34.022
<i>...would come to the door
of so young a physician.</i>


113
00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.067
<i>I had to go out into the streets
in search of them.</i>


114
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.997
Too late for that one.

115
00:11:30.807 --> 00:11:33.085
Come over here, into the shade.

116
00:11:34.177 --> 00:11:35.792
Here, sit down.

117
00:11:36.078 --> 00:11:37.346
I can help you.

118
00:11:37.346 --> 00:11:39.916
Under certain conditions,
blindness can be cured with a needle.


119
00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.418
Alas, no physician
can restore my eye.


120
00:11:42.585 --> 00:11:45.688
My first master put it out
when I drank a jar of beer...


121
00:11:45.988 --> 00:11:48.524
...and refilled it in a manner
which displeased him.


122
00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:50.593
- Then what is the matter with you?
- Nothing...


123
00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:53.029
...I'm as healthy
as the 40 sacred baboons.


124
00:11:53.096 --> 00:11:54.730
My name is Kaptah...

125
00:11:54.831 --> 00:11:56.899
...and I've decided
to be your servant.


126
00:11:57.867 --> 00:12:00.002
Even if I needed one,
I couldn't afford it.


127
00:12:00.103 --> 00:12:03.239
And if I could afford it,
I wouldn't employ a ragged beggar.


128
00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.007
I may be ragged,
but I'm intelligent...


129
00:12:05.374 --> 00:12:08.010
...I am handsome
and I can read.


130
00:12:09.003 --> 00:12:11.160
Well, you're quite right, master,
I am a poor servant.


131
00:12:11.162 --> 00:12:13.676
But then you're a poor physician
and deserve no better.


132
00:12:13.783 --> 00:12:14.884
I shall obey your orders...

133
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.453
...you may beat me,
within reason...


134
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.422
...and in return,
I shall steal from you...


135
00:12:20.022 --> 00:12:21.224
...also within reason.

136
00:12:21.226 --> 00:12:22.660
Ohm then you admit
you're a thief?


137
00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:25.050
We are all thieves.
Only the dishonest ones deny it.


138
00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:28.128
I will improve your reputation.
People will say:


139
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.488
"He must be a good physician
if he can afford a servant".


140
00:12:32.135 --> 00:12:33.803
With one eye? They will say:

141
00:12:33.808 --> 00:12:36.477
"He must be a poor physician
not to have cured his own servant".


142
00:12:36.606 --> 00:12:39.675
Well, I shall say that when
you first bought me I was totally blind...


143
00:12:39.776 --> 00:12:41.894
...and that you restored
half my sight.


144
00:12:43.327 --> 00:12:46.209
Master! Master!

145
00:13:05.881 --> 00:13:11.767
Heave! Heave! Heave!

146
00:13:45.297 --> 00:13:51.804
Heave! Heave! Heave!

147
00:13:58.654 --> 00:14:00.765
Master! Master!

148
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:02.862
Master, come quickly!

149
00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.495
Come quickly!

150
00:14:07.063 --> 00:14:09.077
Look. This is your chance.

151
00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:11.300
I told you I'd make
your reputation.


152
00:14:24.914 --> 00:14:27.516
Come here everyone!
Come here and watch!


153
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.982
You shall see such wonders
as your eyes have never beheld.


154
00:14:30.987 --> 00:14:35.473
The gods themselves have instructed
my master in his arts.


155
00:14:35.515 --> 00:14:40.391
Known to him are the ancient spells
and potions of our ancestors.


156
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:41.395
Come here and watch!

157
00:14:41.397 --> 00:14:43.366
- Someone bring water.
- Here's water.


158
00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:45.501
Moisten the cloth,
and squeeze it between his lips.


159
00:14:45.568 --> 00:14:47.570
I'll need fire to purify
my instruments.


160
00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:50.406
Fire. Bring fire,
for the worker of wonders.


161
00:14:55.545 --> 00:14:57.620
The fire won't be needed,
he's dead.


162
00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:03.052
Observe! Observe the wisdom
and mercy of my master!


163
00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.131
Lest this poor soul
be forced to hobble...


164
00:15:05.135 --> 00:15:07.519
...for the rest
of his life on one foot...


165
00:15:07.623 --> 00:15:11.901
...my master has granted him
the boon of death.


166
00:15:13.763 --> 00:15:15.652
No one could have saved him.

167
00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.595
Saved him?

168
00:15:18.367 --> 00:15:19.815
For what?

169
00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:23.930
So the young physician
is still asking "why"?


170
00:15:32.648 --> 00:15:33.683
Master...

171
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.852
...that's a dangerous woman.

172
00:15:43.392 --> 00:15:44.527
Dangerous?

173
00:15:44.794 --> 00:15:47.630
The look in her eye,
the look of a calfless calf, for a ewe...


174
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:48.965
...for it's lamb.

175
00:15:49.165 --> 00:15:52.001
Beware of such looks, master,
her mind is on breaking...


176
00:15:52.004 --> 00:15:53.514
...a jar with you...

177
00:15:54.133 --> 00:15:55.698
...on marriage.

178
00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.542
I don't even know her name.

179
00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:13.089
<i>Her name was Merit.
She was a tavern maid.</i>


180
00:16:13.256 --> 00:16:15.158
<i>And she could neither read,
nor write.</i>


181
00:16:15.258 --> 00:16:17.026
<i>She loved me all her life.</i>

182
00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:20.156
<i>But this I didn't learn</i>
<i>until it was too late.</i>


183
00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.035
People of Thebes!

184
00:16:59.402 --> 00:17:01.237
Ask pity of the gods!

185
00:17:01.537 --> 00:17:03.005
Pharaoh is dead!

186
00:17:19.088 --> 00:17:20.823
They have been caterwauling all night!

187
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.760
The fools think they can bring
pharaoh back to life?


188
00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:29.165
Why don't you take him home?
It's early morning.


189
00:17:29.232 --> 00:17:30.333
What's wrong with him?

190
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.469
He was refused an appointment
in the palace guards...


191
00:17:33.536 --> 00:17:35.041
...because of his birth.

192
00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:38.834
You don't have to lower your voice.
I know what you're saying!


193
00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:42.879
Yeah, I was refused!

194
00:17:42.945 --> 00:17:44.744
Refused because of my birth!

195
00:17:44.781 --> 00:17:46.282
Look at the ones they accepted!

196
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:48.117
Mincing perfumed idiots...

197
00:17:48.217 --> 00:17:50.586
...who carry sunshades,
and twitter like birds!


198
00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:55.324
How long till dawn?

199
00:17:55.975 --> 00:17:57.542
An hour, perhaps.

200
00:17:59.804 --> 00:18:01.197
Did you ever hunt lions?

201
00:18:02.064 --> 00:18:03.184
No?

202
00:18:05.268 --> 00:18:07.036
I saw a black mane male...

203
00:18:07.136 --> 00:18:08.805
...drinking from a pool at sunset.

204
00:18:08.829 --> 00:18:10.139
But if he never hunted lions...

205
00:18:10.206 --> 00:18:12.208
He is under my protection,
I told you once before.


206
00:18:12.275 --> 00:18:13.443
I need no protection.

207
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.279
I'll bring you back
the skin of a lion myself.


208
00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:19.858
Suppose the lion brings back your skin,
what happens to me?


209
00:18:19.949 --> 00:18:22.351
Find another master to rob,
richer than I am.


210
00:18:22.618 --> 00:18:24.320
Sinuhe, please be careful.

211
00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:29.859
To pay our score.

212
00:18:33.062 --> 00:18:34.831
May it benefit, my lord.

213
00:18:34.897 --> 00:18:36.833
Let's go before
she changes your mind!


214
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.571
You know
that's how I lost my eye.


215
00:18:42.004 --> 00:18:43.306
Lion hunting.

216
00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.844
Son of a cheese-maker.

217
00:21:39.323 --> 00:21:41.563
Why didn't you run, you fool?
You were nearly killed!


218
00:21:42.186 --> 00:21:43.387
Be quiet.

219
00:21:44.087 --> 00:21:45.155
The god is coming.

220
00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:48.625
What's he talking about?

221
00:21:49.092 --> 00:21:50.594
He said "The god is coming".

222
00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:53.096
Which god?

223
00:21:54.298 --> 00:21:57.367
He is coming. Aton.

224
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:59.839
Aton?

225
00:22:02.223 --> 00:22:03.264
Look!

226
00:22:03.306 --> 00:22:05.175
He worships the face of the sun.

227
00:22:11.548 --> 00:22:13.050
Thy dawning is beautiful...

228
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.918
...in the horizon of heaven.

229
00:22:15.552 --> 00:22:18.322
Oh, living Aton,
beginning of life...


230
00:22:23.761 --> 00:22:26.096
- What's the matter with him?
- He has the holy sickness.


231
00:22:31.435 --> 00:22:34.438
At least I can prevent him
from biting his tongue.


232
00:22:37.808 --> 00:22:39.243
Well, we can't leave him here.

233
00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:40.729
Let's take him in the city.

234
00:22:54.525 --> 00:22:55.526
Seize them!

235
00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:03.200
What's wrong?
What have we done?


236
00:23:03.267 --> 00:23:06.203
You'll find out in good time.
Put them in chains.


237
00:23:13.911 --> 00:23:15.916
<i>For two days, we were held
without knowledge...</i>


238
00:23:15.918 --> 00:23:17.647
<i>...of the reason for our arrest.</i>

239
00:23:17.915 --> 00:23:20.317
<i>Then we were taken under guard
to the Royal Palace.</i>


240
00:23:26.407 --> 00:23:27.453
Silence!

241
00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:29.893
On your faces!

242
00:23:30.794 --> 00:23:32.563
Our new pharaoh comes!

243
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.509
On your faces
before the Living God.


244
00:24:11.435 --> 00:24:14.090
The one we called fool,
is pharaoh.


245
00:24:15.138 --> 00:24:17.558
We'll lose our heads for this.

246
00:24:34.691 --> 00:24:36.226
Princess, come back!

247
00:24:36.293 --> 00:24:39.530
Mighty pharaoh! King of Upper
and Lower Egypt...


248
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.597
Princess!

249
00:24:42.966 --> 00:24:44.368
Look, father!

250
00:24:44.635 --> 00:24:46.870
Hush! Your father is busy.

251
00:24:46.937 --> 00:24:49.373
But I want him
to see my new monkey.


252
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.908
Not now, child.

253
00:24:51.175 --> 00:24:52.676
Sit down, princess.

254
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.816
Mighty pharaoh!
King of Upper and Lower Egypt!


255
00:24:59.183 --> 00:25:01.685
- Son of the Sun...
- You have feet.


256
00:25:02.352 --> 00:25:03.754
Stand on them.

257
00:25:09.126 --> 00:25:12.789
You will please me much better
if you will all rise.


258
00:25:18.368 --> 00:25:21.069
My heart is heavy because
of my father's death.


259
00:25:21.939 --> 00:25:24.274
Let us finish our affairs
as quickly as possible.


260
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:28.415
The embassies
of Hati and Kush...


261
00:25:29.012 --> 00:25:31.114
...come to pay respect
to the new pharaoh.


262
00:25:31.215 --> 00:25:33.484
- There are gifts from...
- Later.


263
00:25:38.455 --> 00:25:40.891
I wish to see the two prisoners
you spoke of.


264
00:25:41.658 --> 00:25:42.826
Are they here?

265
00:25:43.393 --> 00:25:44.695
Yes, Sire.

266
00:25:48.765 --> 00:25:50.364
Come forward!

267
00:25:57.574 --> 00:25:58.575
On your knees!

268
00:25:58.976 --> 00:26:00.244
On your feet!

269
00:26:07.217 --> 00:26:09.486
Why have these men
been held without trial?


270
00:26:09.553 --> 00:26:11.255
Their crime is sacrilege, Sire.

271
00:26:11.722 --> 00:26:14.591
They laid hands on the sacred
person of pharaoh.


272
00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:17.060
Sinuhe, a physician,
the son of Senmut.


273
00:26:17.261 --> 00:26:19.980
Horemheb,
the son of a cheese-maker.


274
00:26:20.531 --> 00:26:22.142
Come forward.

275
00:26:22.349 --> 00:26:24.601
For a cheese-maker
he has bold eyes.


276
00:26:25.969 --> 00:26:28.005
The other one, the physician...

277
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:31.404
- Notice his features.
- You are the son of Senmut?


278
00:26:31.408 --> 00:26:33.477
I've heard of his work
among the poor.


279
00:26:33.844 --> 00:26:35.490
Come closer.

280
00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:39.183
Sire, he must die!
He laid hands on you!


281
00:26:39.283 --> 00:26:41.857
I know that.
It was to help me.


282
00:26:42.136 --> 00:26:44.688
The law makes
no such distinction, Sire!


283
00:26:46.757 --> 00:26:48.659
Have I the power
to change the law?


284
00:26:51.628 --> 00:26:53.897
There is no limit
to pharaoh's power!


285
00:26:55.566 --> 00:26:56.967
The law is changed.

286
00:27:02.306 --> 00:27:04.608
I appoint you physician
to my household.


287
00:27:05.976 --> 00:27:09.233
I am deeply grateful, Sire,
but I cannot accept this honor.


288
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.381
Why not?

289
00:27:11.548 --> 00:27:14.153
I've sworn an oath
to serve the poor.


290
00:27:14.218 --> 00:27:15.586
Because of your father?

291
00:27:16.253 --> 00:27:17.946
For that,
and other reasons.


292
00:27:18.055 --> 00:27:19.823
Senmut is not my real father.

293
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:22.960
My parents must have been
of the poor themselves...


294
00:27:22.995 --> 00:27:26.376
...for as a baby I was cast adrift
on the Nile, in a reed boat.


295
00:27:26.864 --> 00:27:29.366
And you never learned
who your parents were?


296
00:27:29.366 --> 00:27:30.567
Perhaps they were fowlers.

297
00:27:30.667 --> 00:27:32.870
The boat was tied
with fowler's knots.


298
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:37.608
"Fowler's knots"?
Did you say "fowler's knots"?


299
00:27:37.674 --> 00:27:38.675
Yes!

300
00:27:39.143 --> 00:27:40.244
Why do you ask, mother?

301
00:27:41.378 --> 00:27:43.766
Curiosity, my son.

302
00:27:46.717 --> 00:27:49.453
You may honor your vows Sinuhe,
and serve the poor.


303
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.422
But on condition you bind
yourself to come to the palace...


304
00:27:52.623 --> 00:27:54.821
...whenever I or my family,
have need of you.


305
00:27:55.826 --> 00:27:57.060
Thank you, Sire!

306
00:27:58.529 --> 00:28:00.831
This other one is no healer,
this cheese-maker's son.


307
00:28:01.098 --> 00:28:03.968
Yet, he too, profane pharaoh
with his touch.


308
00:28:04.234 --> 00:28:05.569
Sire, may I speak?

309
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.371
Speak!

310
00:28:08.038 --> 00:28:11.134
Horemheb saved your life
by slaying the lion.


311
00:28:24.981 --> 00:28:26.590
What is Horemhed's desire?

312
00:28:29.459 --> 00:28:31.795
To let my sword drink the blood
of pharaoh's enemies...


313
00:28:32.763 --> 00:28:35.093
...as my arrow drank
the lion's blood.


314
00:28:35.833 --> 00:28:38.936
This has been foretold
is my... destiny.


315
00:28:41.972 --> 00:28:43.373
And is the destiny of Egypt...

316
00:28:44.241 --> 00:28:46.291
...to be written in blood?

317
00:28:47.177 --> 00:28:49.032
It has always been, Sire.

318
00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.045
As long as there's war,
blood must flow.


319
00:28:56.971 --> 00:28:58.388
What is your request?

320
00:29:01.124 --> 00:29:02.426
An appointment, Sire.

321
00:29:02.493 --> 00:29:04.294
As an officer in your guards.

322
00:29:05.062 --> 00:29:07.030
You request is granted!

323
00:29:08.499 --> 00:29:11.301
I wish he asked to be
our cheese-maker.


324
00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:13.970
- Princess!
- I wish he would!


325
00:29:18.842 --> 00:29:20.110
The sun is setting.

326
00:29:20.777 --> 00:29:22.012
Forgive me all.

327
00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:24.205
I will return to my meditations.

328
00:29:25.415 --> 00:29:27.044
Come, my children.

329
00:30:17.251 --> 00:30:21.008
My Lord, the princess Baketamon
commands your presence.


330
00:30:22.072 --> 00:30:23.073
Follow me.

331
00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:34.318
Not you.

332
00:30:34.485 --> 00:30:36.401
This way, my lord.

333
00:30:53.302 --> 00:30:56.002
Come in physician.
My mother wishes a word with you.


334
00:30:58.107 --> 00:30:59.910
He won't hurt you.

335
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.172
Some more beer.

336
00:31:09.118 --> 00:31:11.059
Come closer.

337
00:31:16.859 --> 00:31:21.390
So, you never learned
who your parents were?


338
00:31:21.432 --> 00:31:23.688
Surely you tried to find out?

339
00:31:24.434 --> 00:31:26.152
Speak up!

340
00:31:26.194 --> 00:31:28.704
I'm content with the parents
I have, your Majesty.


341
00:31:30.807 --> 00:31:34.157
In what year
were you cast adrift?


342
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.815
In the same year
that pharaoh was born.


343
00:31:36.857 --> 00:31:38.619
Or so I've been told.

344
00:31:43.543 --> 00:31:44.744
Why does your Majesty...

345
00:31:44.845 --> 00:31:46.613
You're not here to ask questions.

346
00:31:46.713 --> 00:31:48.640
My mother wishes you
to examine her.


347
00:31:48.699 --> 00:31:50.750
I know that I'm dying.

348
00:31:51.668 --> 00:31:54.038
I want to know
how long it will take.


349
00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:00.391
Don't be shy.

350
00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:18.464
Once, I enjoyed the touch
of a man's hand.


351
00:32:19.363 --> 00:32:21.460
How long ago!

352
00:32:28.172 --> 00:32:30.675
Why do you stop, physician?

353
00:32:31.508 --> 00:32:35.423
To admire the way a queen
can weave a mat of reeds?


354
00:32:36.447 --> 00:32:37.915
Those are fowler's knots!

355
00:32:38.615 --> 00:32:43.197
Didn't you know that my family
were bird catchers in the Lower Kingdom?


356
00:32:43.454 --> 00:32:46.156
And I caught
an eagle in my net.


357
00:32:46.657 --> 00:32:48.592
Pharaoh himself.

358
00:32:51.495 --> 00:32:54.832
He loved me, Sinuhe,
because I was strong and lusty.


359
00:32:54.932 --> 00:32:58.221
Because I was vulgar and unlearned
and told him the truth.


360
00:32:58.669 --> 00:33:01.472
His other wives,
the high born delicate ones...


361
00:33:01.475 --> 00:33:05.920
...with their narrow heads,
how they hated me.


362
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:11.211
So I swore that I would give him a son
to wear the Double Crown.


363
00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:13.517
And I did.

364
00:33:18.088 --> 00:33:20.636
But the gods
were perverse.


365
00:33:21.191 --> 00:33:23.694
They gave me a son
as soft as a woman...


366
00:33:23.695 --> 00:33:26.319
...and a daughter as hard as a man.

367
00:33:28.465 --> 00:33:31.439
Baketamon here,
should be pharaoh.


368
00:33:32.202 --> 00:33:34.271
Not her brother.

369
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.991
Well, what do you find?

370
00:33:41.211 --> 00:33:44.517
- If your Majesty will forgive me...
- Tell her the truth.


371
00:33:44.615 --> 00:33:46.683
If you want
to live much longer...


372
00:33:47.384 --> 00:33:50.617
- ...you must give up the strong brew.
- What impenitence.


373
00:33:50.643 --> 00:33:53.668
I was drinking beer
before you were born.


374
00:33:54.091 --> 00:33:56.160
Your Majesty asked me
for the truth.


375
00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.896
Now I give you
some advice, young man.


376
00:33:58.962 --> 00:34:01.772
Never tell the truth
to an old woman.


377
00:34:01.832 --> 00:34:04.635
Especially if she asks for it.

378
00:34:04.735 --> 00:34:07.606
Go now, you weary me.

379
00:34:24.154 --> 00:34:25.356
What did she want?

380
00:34:26.357 --> 00:34:27.591
I'm not sure.

381
00:34:27.691 --> 00:34:29.927
- Did she speak of me?
- No.


382
00:34:30.828 --> 00:34:32.930
Some day, when I command
the armies, I...


383
00:34:34.131 --> 00:34:36.506
You know, when I think of her,
my blood boils.


384
00:34:38.435 --> 00:34:39.603
Tell me, my friend...

385
00:34:39.903 --> 00:34:42.556
...do you have a potion
or something to cool my fever?


386
00:34:43.173 --> 00:34:46.937
The wise men say that: "One evil spirit
can only be driven out by another."


387
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:49.159
You mean, another woman?

388
00:34:49.513 --> 00:34:52.149
- Of course.
- A noble medicine.


389
00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:54.418
I know just the place.

390
00:34:54.518 --> 00:34:57.321
A woman from Babylon.
She gives a banquet every night.


391
00:34:57.388 --> 00:34:59.089
She won't mind
two additional guests.


392
00:34:59.189 --> 00:35:00.557
- No, I...
- Look...


393
00:35:00.758 --> 00:35:03.045
...we've got to celebrate
our good fortune.


394
00:35:03.994 --> 00:35:05.581
Don't worry, my friend.

395
00:35:05.607 --> 00:35:07.911
You're always
under my protection.


396
00:36:43.627 --> 00:36:46.022
Let's go outside.
We'll show you the garden.


397
00:36:46.563 --> 00:36:47.598
Sinuhe, my friend...

398
00:36:47.931 --> 00:36:50.100
...let's go out in the garden,
and pick a few flowers.


399
00:36:50.103 --> 00:36:53.653
- No, I'll wait for you here.
- Alright, I'll pick a few for you.


400
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.967
Have you never looked
at a woman before?


401
00:38:09.562 --> 00:38:12.930
Hundreds. And in the state
the gods created them.


402
00:38:14.018 --> 00:38:15.985
I'm a physician.

403
00:38:17.287 --> 00:38:18.389
Your name?

404
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.286
I'm called Sinuhe.

405
00:38:21.925 --> 00:38:23.654
"He who is alone."

406
00:38:24.395 --> 00:38:26.229
Is this is your house?

407
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.165
This is my house.

408
00:38:28.666 --> 00:38:31.109
And I have guest every evening.

409
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:34.946
I dislike being alone.

410
00:38:39.043 --> 00:38:40.547
Baraka!

411
00:38:45.049 --> 00:38:47.638
The inscription
of the new pharaoh!


412
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.090
His gift.

413
00:38:50.721 --> 00:38:53.691
- I must leave now.
- Why?


414
00:38:55.459 --> 00:38:59.074
Because men bring you rich presents
for as little as a smile.


415
00:38:59.963 --> 00:39:01.702
This is all I have.

416
00:39:04.802 --> 00:39:07.704
I have never asked a man
for anything.


417
00:39:08.872 --> 00:39:11.329
But I ask you to stay!

418
00:39:13.177 --> 00:39:14.378
I can't.

419
00:39:15.779 --> 00:39:17.748
Is it because
we women of Babylon...


420
00:39:18.048 --> 00:39:20.582
...have such a bad reputation?

421
00:39:23.087 --> 00:39:25.422
Or do you find me so ugly?

422
00:39:29.259 --> 00:39:31.092
Do you?

423
00:39:32.396 --> 00:39:36.700
You're beautiful.
Beyond all dreams.


424
00:39:40.738 --> 00:39:44.196
Such flattery must come easily
to a man who's known...


425
00:39:45.531 --> 00:39:47.526
..."hundreds of women."

426
00:39:48.278 --> 00:39:51.278
No one before has ever seemed
to me so beautiful.


427
00:39:53.117 --> 00:39:55.494
So strange.

428
00:39:56.553 --> 00:39:59.078
When I look in your eyes, I...

429
00:39:59.289 --> 00:40:00.995
I feel...

430
00:40:02.826 --> 00:40:05.288
What do you feel, Sinuhe?

431
00:40:06.463 --> 00:40:09.591
I feel the fever of Thebes
in my blood.


432
00:40:09.633 --> 00:40:13.272
And I know that I was born to live
in the sunset of the world.


433
00:40:13.504 --> 00:40:15.768
And that nothing matters...
nothing...


434
00:40:16.874 --> 00:40:19.203
...but what I see in your eyes.

435
00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:32.056
It's late, I...

436
00:40:32.556 --> 00:40:34.117
I must be leaving.

437
00:40:35.592 --> 00:40:38.035
If you go fulfilled with wine...

438
00:40:38.362 --> 00:40:40.450
...and wild thoughts...

439
00:40:40.698 --> 00:40:44.101
...you will surely get into trouble
with some designing woman.


440
00:40:47.045 --> 00:40:48.339
Would you care?

441
00:41:03.003 --> 00:41:07.076
No, I brought you here
only to show you the gate...


442
00:41:07.102 --> 00:41:08.939
...in my garden wall.

443
00:41:14.164 --> 00:41:15.366
Later...

444
00:41:15.466 --> 00:41:17.468
...when all my guests
have gone...


445
00:41:18.035 --> 00:41:20.703
...I will be here by my lotus pool.

446
00:41:23.474 --> 00:41:25.337
Why do you tell me this?

447
00:41:26.877 --> 00:41:29.305
Perhaps because I'm fond of gifts.

448
00:41:30.381 --> 00:41:33.967
And the greatest gift
any man can bring to a woman is...


449
00:41:34.665 --> 00:41:36.601
...his innocence...

450
00:41:37.287 --> 00:41:39.758
...which he can give only once.

451
00:41:45.329 --> 00:41:47.063
Wait.

452
00:41:47.131 --> 00:41:49.633
Before you touch me,
I must give you a warning.


453
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:50.939
Warning?

454
00:41:51.702 --> 00:41:55.030
There is a reason why the Goddess
of Love takes the form of a cat.


455
00:41:55.038 --> 00:41:57.868
When I look at you,
I care nothing for cats or gods.


456
00:41:59.677 --> 00:42:01.624
Look, Sinuhe...

457
00:42:02.279 --> 00:42:04.667
...a cat's paws are soft...

458
00:42:04.848 --> 00:42:06.922
...but they hide claws.

459
00:42:07.785 --> 00:42:10.996
The cat takes pleasure
in tormenting its victim.


460
00:42:11.622 --> 00:42:13.657
Not until the creature
is nearly dead...


461
00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:17.620
...will it show pity,
and put an end to it.


462
00:42:18.262 --> 00:42:20.562
What does this to do
with you and me?


463
00:42:23.801 --> 00:42:25.736
You hadn't any experience...

464
00:42:27.104 --> 00:42:29.079
...and I must be what I am.

465
00:42:32.076 --> 00:42:33.282
Leave now...

466
00:42:33.324 --> 00:42:36.455
...and do not return
to the gate in my wall...


467
00:42:38.098 --> 00:42:41.085
...or you may regret it
all your life.


468
00:42:45.789 --> 00:42:47.491
I don't even know your name.

469
00:42:50.861 --> 00:42:52.592
In their foolishness...

470
00:42:52.896 --> 00:42:56.674
...men give me the name
which means "beautiful."


471
00:43:04.008 --> 00:43:05.471
Nefer!

472
00:43:07.696 --> 00:43:11.843
Nefer! Nefer!

473
00:43:15.007 --> 00:43:17.399
It's no business of mine
where he spends his time.


474
00:43:17.402 --> 00:43:18.781
Well, if you don't
consider it your business...


475
00:43:18.783 --> 00:43:20.593
...why are you
so angry with me?


476
00:43:21.155 --> 00:43:22.357
Get out.

477
00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:23.791
For a full week now
he's telling me...


478
00:43:23.793 --> 00:43:25.990
...to send his patients
to other physician.


479
00:43:26.032 --> 00:43:28.423
I've even had to return
the coppers I've excepted...


480
00:43:28.465 --> 00:43:30.220
...for appointments with him.

481
00:43:30.832 --> 00:43:33.225
This woman stole his mind.

482
00:43:33.376 --> 00:43:35.103
He's as mad as a jackal
that prowls...


483
00:43:35.203 --> 00:43:38.373
...around the graves
in time of drought.


484
00:43:39.715 --> 00:43:42.910
And I'm as mad as he is.
It was you I warn him against!


485
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.304
Then why come to me now?

486
00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:49.576
There are worse things
than marriage.


487
00:43:49.877 --> 00:43:52.811
How could I be such a fool
even to dream of it?


488
00:43:53.614 --> 00:43:56.358
He is physician
to pharaoh, and I'm...


489
00:43:58.652 --> 00:44:00.748
Kaptah, what can I do?

490
00:44:01.322 --> 00:44:03.783
Offer him more then she can.

491
00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:07.596
Get out, you one-eyed
son of baboon!


492
00:44:07.628 --> 00:44:10.004
Out! Get out!

493
00:45:01.348 --> 00:45:03.460
Why do you wait, Sinuhe?

494
00:45:04.084 --> 00:45:06.349
I've told you that tonight
I'm engaged.


495
00:45:07.588 --> 00:45:10.513
I'm entertaining
a merchant from Syria.


496
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:12.931
If he touches you, 
I'll kill him.

497
00:45:14.695 --> 00:45:17.901
Only foolish boys
speak in such terms.


498
00:45:25.639 --> 00:45:27.825
I must confess, Sinuhe.

499
00:45:27.867 --> 00:45:29.985
I find you appealing.

500
00:45:30.244 --> 00:45:32.375
Very appealing.

501
00:45:32.813 --> 00:45:34.933
You're not like the others.

502
00:45:34.975 --> 00:45:37.373
You're young, and strong...

503
00:45:38.953 --> 00:45:40.845
...and innocent.

504
00:45:46.994 --> 00:45:50.086
But unfortunately,
I must protect myself.


505
00:45:51.332 --> 00:45:53.602
Women like me who live alone...

506
00:45:54.068 --> 00:45:57.021
...cannot afford to give in
to their weaknesses.


507
00:45:57.638 --> 00:46:00.667
Or they end their days
begging in the streets.


508
00:46:00.708 --> 00:46:03.499
I offer you my protection
for as long as you live.


509
00:46:04.378 --> 00:46:07.014
Men have said that to me
so many times...


510
00:46:08.816 --> 00:46:11.131
...in so many tongues.

511
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:15.500
Listen, Sinuhe...

512
00:46:16.657 --> 00:46:17.917
...I live in Egypt...

513
00:46:17.958 --> 00:46:20.677
...because I can never
return to Babylon.


514
00:46:22.062 --> 00:46:25.420
When I was 12 years old,
I was sold as a slave...


515
00:46:25.799 --> 00:46:28.616
...and passed from
one master to another.


516
00:46:28.658 --> 00:46:30.980
Is there any difference
in your life now?


517
00:46:32.973 --> 00:46:35.312
A very great difference.

518
00:46:35.776 --> 00:46:38.485
For now,
no man is my master.


519
00:46:41.115 --> 00:46:44.108
The Syrian merchant
who dines with me tonight...


520
00:46:44.184 --> 00:46:47.659
...brings me a ruby
that once belonged to a queen.


521
00:46:47.755 --> 00:46:50.780
But to give away a present
from pharaoh is sacrilege.


522
00:46:51.759 --> 00:46:53.627
I ask for nothing.

523
00:46:54.628 --> 00:46:57.505
I only want you to understand.

524
00:47:43.877 --> 00:47:45.846
You must go now.

525
00:47:46.747 --> 00:47:50.637
- My guest will be here at any moment.
- Send him away.


526
00:47:51.485 --> 00:47:55.564
- I told you why I can't.
- Send him away!


527
00:47:57.591 --> 00:47:59.482
You're hurting me!

528
00:48:03.631 --> 00:48:06.741
I've given you the only thing
of value that I have.


529
00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:08.403
Isn't that what you wanted?

530
00:48:11.772 --> 00:48:14.380
What deceivers men are.

531
00:48:15.509 --> 00:48:18.291
And you're the same
as all the rest.


532
00:48:19.113 --> 00:48:22.086
You're not so poor
as you pretend, Sinuhe.


533
00:48:23.017 --> 00:48:24.870
You have a house...

534
00:48:25.452 --> 00:48:28.500
...and many fine
instruments of copper.


535
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:33.168
If I give them to you,
will you promise me...


536
00:48:33.794 --> 00:48:36.104
I promise nothing.

537
00:48:37.298 --> 00:48:39.844
If you wish
to give me a present...


538
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.733
...do so.

539
00:48:42.736 --> 00:48:45.339
But ask nothing from me...

540
00:48:45.539 --> 00:48:48.614
...as I ask nothing from you.

541
00:48:52.646 --> 00:48:55.411
I'm an evil woman, Sinuhe.

542
00:48:55.453 --> 00:48:58.493
From the very beginning
I warned you.


543
00:48:59.119 --> 00:49:01.805
Keep your house
and your instruments...


544
00:49:01.847 --> 00:49:03.961
...and go!

545
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.832
Your Highness shoots well,
for a woman.


546
00:50:22.002 --> 00:50:24.038
A child's game.

547
00:50:24.238 --> 00:50:27.178
- I see you won promotion.
- Why not?


548
00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.879
A real soldier here
is like a falcon among sparrows.


549
00:50:31.478 --> 00:50:34.756
I wish a word with you,
over here!


550
00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:38.397
May I say, I long dreamed
of a word with you?


551
00:50:38.439 --> 00:50:40.753
We won't discuss your dreams.

552
00:50:41.855 --> 00:50:44.391
I wish to speak of your friend,
the physician.


553
00:50:44.904 --> 00:50:47.019
Why are you so interested in him?

554
00:50:47.394 --> 00:50:49.520
My brother has been asking for him.

555
00:50:49.562 --> 00:50:52.036
He hasn't yet presented
himself at court.


556
00:50:52.333 --> 00:50:55.314
Sinuhe has... left the city.

557
00:50:55.356 --> 00:50:57.372
He's gone to... 
Memphis I think.

558
00:50:57.414 --> 00:51:00.361
If you hope for further promotions,
don't lie to me.


559
00:51:00.935 --> 00:51:03.505
I love my friend enough
to lie for him.


560
00:51:03.804 --> 00:51:06.086
Even to a royal princess.

561
00:51:06.507 --> 00:51:07.675
What do you want?

562
00:51:07.675 --> 00:51:10.720
I want him saved from this creature
who has stolen his wits.


563
00:51:11.312 --> 00:51:13.781
That's easy.
She's a Babylonian.


564
00:51:13.848 --> 00:51:16.417
- Have her banished, or killed.
- He'll follow her into exile...


565
00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.094
...or moan over a grave
the rest of his life.


566
00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:23.307
No. He must be made to see
that she is worthless.


567
00:51:23.791 --> 00:51:26.153
And how do you expect
to accomplish that?


568
00:51:26.561 --> 00:51:28.696
By letting him find out
that she has betrayed him...


569
00:51:28.796 --> 00:51:30.518
...with his best friend.

570
00:51:33.167 --> 00:51:35.002
You shouldn't find that too difficult.

571
00:51:35.102 --> 00:51:37.957
Such women like to be assaulted
as if they were fortresses.


572
00:51:38.973 --> 00:51:40.541
Your Highness flatters me.

573
00:51:40.741 --> 00:51:43.907
I value you in the same way
that you value yourself.


574
00:51:46.447 --> 00:51:48.101
Give me that bracelet.

575
00:51:48.616 --> 00:51:49.684
You want a reward...

576
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.562
...for helping a friend
you love so much?


577
00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.130
I want it for the Babylonian.

578
00:51:58.083 --> 00:52:01.487
Then you're afraid that
your manly charms won't be enough?


579
00:52:01.529 --> 00:52:02.897
Not for her!

580
00:52:05.099 --> 00:52:06.967
My friends are watching us.

581
00:52:07.268 --> 00:52:09.274
They think
you're awarding me an honor.


582
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:11.443
Let them think what they will.

583
00:52:14.709 --> 00:52:17.570
Some day you'll strip
your arms of honors for me.


584
00:52:18.112 --> 00:52:20.139
Your ankles, and your neck.

585
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:22.586
Save your passions
to the Babylonian.


586
00:52:23.084 --> 00:52:25.223
She'll appreciate them
more than I do.


587
00:52:50.895 --> 00:52:52.380
Open up, let me in.

588
00:52:52.446 --> 00:52:55.852
The hour is late.
I have orders to admit no one.


589
00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:57.919
Your mistress is expecting me.

590
00:52:57.985 --> 00:53:01.082
- I have a message from her.
- Those are my orders.


591
00:53:08.687 --> 00:53:09.806
Horemheb.

592
00:53:12.733 --> 00:53:14.248
Horemhed!

593
00:53:15.303 --> 00:53:17.438
Nefer, let me in!

594
00:53:17.805 --> 00:53:18.906
Horemhed!

595
00:53:19.574 --> 00:53:21.142
Nefer, let me in!

596
00:53:21.574 --> 00:53:23.009
Horemhed!

597
00:53:27.148 --> 00:53:28.559
You must go.

598
00:53:29.183 --> 00:53:30.611
He knows you're here.

599
00:53:31.252 --> 00:53:33.352
I don't care, do you?

600
00:53:34.689 --> 00:53:37.263
I sent him no message
to come tonight.


601
00:53:37.305 --> 00:53:40.228
I took the liberty of sending one
in your name, do you mind?


602
00:53:41.896 --> 00:53:43.410
So, that's it.

603
00:53:48.135 --> 00:53:49.413
Go now!

604
00:54:09.457 --> 00:54:10.858
Stupid fool!

605
00:54:10.925 --> 00:54:12.493
I'll kill you!

606
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.861
You're crazy!

607
00:54:18.366 --> 00:54:20.034
Listen, you fool!

608
00:54:20.201 --> 00:54:22.327
It was our friendship
that brought me here.


609
00:54:22.336 --> 00:54:23.742
Can't you see what she is?

610
00:54:23.905 --> 00:54:26.503
The only reason I came here
it was to prove it to you.


611
00:54:28.042 --> 00:54:30.030
Never call me friend again!

612
00:54:31.145 --> 00:54:33.648
- Get out!
- Very well.


613
00:54:34.815 --> 00:54:36.817
You'll deserve everything
you'll get from her.


614
00:54:43.723 --> 00:54:45.347
You may go too.

615
00:54:45.424 --> 00:54:47.593
This is my house,
and it is not a tavern.


616
00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.111
Nefer, wait.

617
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:52.019
Look, here...

618
00:54:52.498 --> 00:54:54.525
...I brought you what you asked.

619
00:54:56.002 --> 00:54:57.403
The deed to my house...

620
00:54:57.703 --> 00:54:59.005
...my instruments.

621
00:54:59.705 --> 00:55:01.912
I never asked you for this trash!

622
00:55:22.662 --> 00:55:24.230
It's all I have...

623
00:55:25.297 --> 00:55:27.844
...and not entirely trash.

624
00:55:28.401 --> 00:55:31.978
The house is small,
but it's fitted up for a physician's use.


625
00:55:32.972 --> 00:55:35.862
The instruments are the finest.

626
00:55:35.903 --> 00:55:38.153
They're worth as much
as precious jewels.


627
00:55:47.053 --> 00:55:48.324
There...

628
00:55:49.288 --> 00:55:51.567
...now you own
everything that was mine.


629
00:55:51.624 --> 00:55:54.327
Sinuhe, please! I'm tired.

630
00:55:54.427 --> 00:55:55.928
You always have some excuse.

631
00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:58.331
- Nefer, I...
- Wait.


632
00:56:00.466 --> 00:56:02.568
Since you won't listen
to my warnings...


633
00:56:03.469 --> 00:56:06.105
...you force me to treat you
like my other friends.


634
00:56:06.205 --> 00:56:07.879
What more
do you want from me?


635
00:56:08.407 --> 00:56:09.875
For you I've disobeyed pharaoh...

636
00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:12.823
...disgraced my family,
beggared myself.


637
00:56:13.446 --> 00:56:15.553
And still you lie to me.

638
00:56:15.881 --> 00:56:17.049
Lie?

639
00:56:18.017 --> 00:56:19.270
How?

640
00:56:21.387 --> 00:56:23.763
Why have you chosen
not to tell me...


641
00:56:23.956 --> 00:56:27.113
...that your father
has a fine house on the waterfront?


642
00:56:27.426 --> 00:56:29.859
I can't give you
what isn't my own.


643
00:56:31.263 --> 00:56:34.745
Or that he has built and furnished
for his wife and himself...


644
00:56:35.368 --> 00:56:38.289
...a splendid tomb
in the City of the Dead?


645
00:56:40.806 --> 00:56:44.381
You're asking me to rob
my parents of immortality.


646
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:47.165
To let their bodies,
rot into nothingness...


647
00:56:47.168 --> 00:56:50.042
...like the carcasses
of slaves and animals?


648
00:56:50.716 --> 00:56:52.648
I ask for nothing.

649
00:56:55.321 --> 00:56:57.967
But if you do
this one thing for me...


650
00:56:58.758 --> 00:57:02.106
...I will show you
the finer perfection of love.


651
00:57:56.148 --> 00:57:57.983
What are you doing here?

652
00:57:58.117 --> 00:58:00.749
You haven't been to the tavern
for many days.


653
00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.889
- I had to see you.
- The man you know, is dead!


654
00:58:04.457 --> 00:58:05.998
Forget him!

655
00:58:06.625 --> 00:58:08.506
I could never forget you.

656
00:58:10.429 --> 00:58:13.264
Sinuhe, please listen to me,
I want to help you.


657
00:58:13.799 --> 00:58:16.145
I am not without experience.

658
00:58:16.235 --> 00:58:19.130
You learn a great deal
about life in a tavern.


659
00:58:19.772 --> 00:58:23.026
Every night, I see the hunger
in men's eyes.


660
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:26.145
With a tavern maid
they don't trouble to hide it.


661
00:58:26.946 --> 00:58:29.949
There are some who approach you
arrogantly, demanding...


662
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:32.576
...like your friend Horemheb.

663
00:58:32.952 --> 00:58:35.909
That kind can never
be hurt by a woman.


664
00:58:37.089 --> 00:58:39.959
Then there are those
too shy to ask...


665
00:58:40.459 --> 00:58:43.079
...but the hunger
is in their eyes too.


666
00:58:43.929 --> 00:58:46.584
They are the ones
who are unarmed.


667
00:58:47.233 --> 00:58:50.839
Because they are afraid to approach
a woman who might make them happy...


668
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.831
...they fall an easy victim
to the other kind.


669
00:58:56.208 --> 00:58:57.610
They think they are in love...

670
00:58:57.710 --> 00:59:00.386
...because they have no way
of knowing what love is.


671
00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.944
What are you trying to say?

672
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:05.651
What I shouldn't have to say...

673
00:59:05.751 --> 00:59:08.573
...when you come home at this hour,
and find me waiting for you.


674
00:59:09.789 --> 00:59:12.116
If you wish to help me, you can.

675
00:59:16.962 --> 00:59:19.000
Here are the deeds
to my parents' house...


676
00:59:19.005 --> 00:59:22.216
...to the tomb which they thought
would give them immortality.


677
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:27.259
Here it is her name,
the new owner.


678
00:59:27.473 --> 00:59:29.875
Read it, Merit.
Nefer! Nefer! Nefer!


679
00:59:29.976 --> 00:59:31.548
Sinuhe, you can't!

680
00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:34.684
The deeds have to be witnessed.
Be the first to sign!


681
00:59:35.815 --> 00:59:37.559
Go on! Sign!

682
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:40.385
If you can't write,
make your mark!


683
00:59:43.389 --> 00:59:44.957
Gods have pity on you!

684
01:00:34.173 --> 01:00:36.698
The house and tomb are yours.

685
01:00:38.744 --> 01:00:41.380
From this hour
I am accused and disgraced...


686
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.411
...before gods and men.

687
01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:46.194
It's a high price to pay.

688
01:00:47.286 --> 01:00:49.879
Now prove to me
that it's not too high.


689
01:00:50.656 --> 01:00:53.052
How should I prove it, Sinuhe?

690
01:00:53.459 --> 01:00:55.061
By keeping your promise.

691
01:00:56.062 --> 01:00:57.795
Promise?

692
01:00:57.930 --> 01:00:59.635
What did I promise?

693
01:01:03.269 --> 01:01:05.640
The perfection of love.

694
01:01:05.838 --> 01:01:07.556
I did?

695
01:01:09.075 --> 01:01:11.977
Sinuhe, as I have already told you...

696
01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.149
...I find you very appealing.

697
01:01:16.482 --> 01:01:20.081
Are you quite sure that
"perfection" is what you want?


698
01:01:21.554 --> 01:01:23.284
Yes.

699
01:01:25.491 --> 01:01:27.731
Then you shall have it.

700
01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:30.289
I will end your misery.

701
01:01:31.931 --> 01:01:33.590
Secum!

702
01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.512
Show this man to the door.

703
01:01:36.836 --> 01:01:39.601
Never admit him
to my house again.


704
01:01:50.216 --> 01:01:51.616
Every philosopher knows...

705
01:01:51.617 --> 01:01:54.389
...that we spend our lives
seeking perfection...


706
01:01:55.354 --> 01:01:59.044
...and find it
only in an ending.


707
01:02:00.393 --> 01:02:01.997
Ending?

708
01:02:02.828 --> 01:02:06.664
Sooner or later,
even a cat tires of it's game.


709
01:02:24.517 --> 01:02:25.874
Sinuhe!

710
01:02:27.687 --> 01:02:28.954
Sinuhe!

711
01:02:29.187 --> 01:02:30.787
No!

712
01:02:35.687 --> 01:02:37.954
Baraka! Secum!

713
01:02:42.687 --> 01:02:47.028
Sinuhe! Sinuhe!

714
01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:07.787
<i>Once again I came alone, and in darkness
to the house of my parents.</i>


715
01:04:08.487 --> 01:04:10.979
<i>The house that
was no longer theirs.</i>


716
01:04:43.089 --> 01:04:44.956
How did they die?

717
01:04:45.491 --> 01:04:47.235
As you should know, master...

718
01:04:47.238 --> 01:04:50.448
...a physician can turn
his skill to taking life...


719
01:04:50.663 --> 01:04:52.579
...as well as to saving it.

720
01:04:59.872 --> 01:05:02.162
Your father left this for you.

721
01:05:03.042 --> 01:05:04.544
Read it.

722
01:05:05.044 --> 01:05:06.806
I can't.

723
01:05:08.347 --> 01:05:09.963
Then listen.

724
01:05:13.486 --> 01:05:16.006
"To Sinuhe, our son.

725
01:05:16.255 --> 01:05:20.893
We are grieved for your sake,
because you have met with ill fortune.


726
01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:25.340
Do not regret that you were required
to sell our tomb.


727
01:05:25.382 --> 01:05:28.167
For all existence is vanity...

728
01:05:28.668 --> 01:05:32.605
...we desire no life
in the hereafter.


729
01:05:33.005 --> 01:05:37.289
Remember always that
we blessed you before we left.


730
01:05:37.443 --> 01:05:40.546
For you who came to us
from the river...


731
01:05:40.946 --> 01:05:42.748
...when we were already old...

732
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:46.018
...were the greatest joy
of our lives.


733
01:05:46.118 --> 01:05:49.443
May your heart
be shielded from sorrow.


734
01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:54.060
Such is the desire of your father...

735
01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.980
...and your mother."

736
01:06:17.516 --> 01:06:20.019
What do you want here
in the House of Death?


737
01:06:20.886 --> 01:06:23.088
I've brought you the bodies
of a man and a woman...


738
01:06:23.389 --> 01:06:25.558
...to be preserved by your art...

739
01:06:25.624 --> 01:06:28.171
...so that they may enjoy
eternal life.


740
01:06:28.761 --> 01:06:30.930
As you say,
we are artists here.


741
01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:33.840
What can you pay for our services?

742
01:06:35.167 --> 01:06:36.713
I have nothing.

743
01:06:36.802 --> 01:06:40.471
Nothing? Throw this carrion
in the river.


744
01:06:41.974 --> 01:06:45.077
Wait! I am willing to work here...

745
01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:47.295
...to pay for the embalming...

746
01:06:47.379 --> 01:06:50.816
- ...for as long as you say I must.
- Work here?


747
01:06:51.417 --> 01:06:53.219
Only condemned criminals...

748
01:06:53.419 --> 01:06:57.453
...and the accursed of the gods
seek work in the House of Death.


749
01:06:57.590 --> 01:07:00.748
There is no man here
who is not better than I am.


750
01:07:04.296 --> 01:07:05.838
Put him to work!

751
01:07:07.399 --> 01:07:11.983
<i>For 90 days I labored among
the accursed in the House of Death.</i>


752
01:07:12.238 --> 01:07:14.858
<i>It was as if I had died myself.</i>

753
01:07:15.107 --> 01:07:16.775
<i>And only my servant, Kaptah...</i>

754
01:07:16.976 --> 01:07:20.145
<i>...knew what I had done,
or where I was.</i>


755
01:08:40.896 --> 01:08:42.387
What are you doing here?

756
01:08:42.429 --> 01:08:44.166
Speak, or I'll bash your head in!

757
01:08:44.232 --> 01:08:46.335
- Are you a god?
- God?


758
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:48.929
No god would dare
show his face here after dark.


759
01:08:48.971 --> 01:08:50.639
You're a grave robber!

760
01:08:50.806 --> 01:08:52.874
I didn't come here to steal.

761
01:08:52.941 --> 01:08:54.209
What do you want then?

762
01:08:55.478 --> 01:08:58.523
I brought my parents
here to bury them.


763
01:08:59.949 --> 01:09:02.413
In the Valley of the Kings?

764
01:09:03.219 --> 01:09:04.854
I hoped that
if I buried them here...


765
01:09:04.921 --> 01:09:06.856
...they might share
the wealth of the pharaohs...


766
01:09:06.923 --> 01:09:08.376
...in the other world.

767
01:09:09.225 --> 01:09:10.627
Other world!

768
01:09:13.296 --> 01:09:15.265
It's true that many pharaohs
planted here...


769
01:09:15.268 --> 01:09:17.965
...but I have yet to see one of them
putting out any shoots.


770
01:09:18.002 --> 01:09:20.469
And it's certainly
they don't see the gifts...


771
01:09:20.511 --> 01:09:22.219
...because we get them first.

772
01:09:23.307 --> 01:09:25.855
You don't believe in another life.

773
01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:31.729
They did.

774
01:09:34.085 --> 01:09:35.820
You're a strange one.

775
01:09:36.887 --> 01:09:38.316
I'll help you dig.

776
01:09:57.684 --> 01:10:00.141
I wish somehow
I could mark their graves.


777
01:10:01.384 --> 01:10:04.178
Mark or unmarked,
it's all the same.


778
01:10:04.925 --> 01:10:07.206
20 years
to build a pyramid...


779
01:10:07.374 --> 01:10:10.567
...or 10 minutes to scrap
a hole in the sand.


780
01:10:11.578 --> 01:10:14.114
Dead are dead,
no matter where we put them.


781
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:19.286
In the end,
the sand conquers all.


782
01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:21.070
Every grain of sand...

783
01:10:21.136 --> 01:10:25.674
...will outlive every man alive,
and every man that ever will be born.


784
01:10:26.442 --> 01:10:27.977
Immortality?

785
01:10:28.644 --> 01:10:30.446
I hold it in my hand.

786
01:10:31.223 --> 01:10:34.924
Only the little grains of sand
will never die.


787
01:10:37.559 --> 01:10:38.627
Listen!

788
01:10:40.144 --> 01:10:41.215
A jackal.

789
01:10:42.531 --> 01:10:44.299
A jackal with two legs.

790
01:10:44.466 --> 01:10:47.135
One of my friends warning us
there is a stranger coming.


791
01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.937
Here, in the shadow.

792
01:11:00.683 --> 01:11:02.322
Sinuhe?

793
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.857
- That you?
- Yes.


794
01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:11.837
This is as good a place
as any to meet a woman.


795
01:11:19.962 --> 01:11:21.171
Sinuhe?

796
01:11:28.332 --> 01:11:29.841
How did you find me?

797
01:11:30.802 --> 01:11:32.103
Kaptah told me.

798
01:11:32.837 --> 01:11:34.405
He told me what you've done.

799
01:11:35.273 --> 01:11:38.481
How you labored 90 days
in the House of Death.


800
01:11:39.243 --> 01:11:40.445
Keep away!

801
01:11:42.195 --> 01:11:44.613
The smell of death is still on me.

802
01:11:47.226 --> 01:11:49.228
How long since you've eaten?

803
01:11:49.997 --> 01:11:51.298
I don't know.

804
01:11:57.838 --> 01:11:59.843
I brought you some bread and wine.

805
01:12:03.844 --> 01:12:06.173
Go back, Merit. Go back.

806
01:12:07.397 --> 01:12:08.949
Leave me alone.

807
01:12:09.216 --> 01:12:10.925
Not until you've eaten.

808
01:12:11.686 --> 01:12:13.437
Sit here, Sinuhe.

809
01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:15.856
To please me if nothing else.

810
01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.942
Bread?

811
01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:35.909
Some wine?

812
01:12:52.012 --> 01:12:55.148
Thebes, city of lust and evil.

813
01:12:55.415 --> 01:12:57.217
Men deserve injustice.

814
01:12:59.002 --> 01:13:01.999
They deserve their cruel priests,
and evil gods...


815
01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:03.936
...for we are vile!

816
01:13:05.525 --> 01:13:08.628
No more than a crawling disease
on the face of the earth.


817
01:13:11.573 --> 01:13:14.275
The grave is the only cure
for our vileness.


818
01:13:16.219 --> 01:13:17.954
That is what I've learned.

819
01:13:22.927 --> 01:13:24.801
I'll take you back to the city.

820
01:13:27.131 --> 01:13:29.055
You can't go back.

821
01:13:29.634 --> 01:13:32.854
Pharaoh's daughter died because
you couldn't be found to save her.


822
01:13:38.009 --> 01:13:39.929
He's frantic with grief.

823
01:13:40.511 --> 01:13:41.936
Sinuhe, he's...

824
01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.274
He's sentenced you to death.

825
01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:53.191
It means nothing.

826
01:13:53.792 --> 01:13:55.994
Death never comes to him
who asks for it.


827
01:13:57.462 --> 01:13:59.898
I know this too
in my new wisdom.


828
01:14:00.565 --> 01:14:02.075
Do you call that wisdom?

829
01:14:02.117 --> 01:14:05.376
To despise yourself
because of what one woman did to you?


830
01:14:08.507 --> 01:14:11.277
Do you really think
all women are like that?


831
01:14:12.645 --> 01:14:15.614
Can't you believe in a love
that asks for nothing?


832
01:14:21.087 --> 01:14:22.778
My love!

833
01:14:50.585 --> 01:14:51.920
Everything is arranged, master.

834
01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:54.256
- I was able to buy passage for us!
- Buy it?


835
01:14:54.322 --> 01:14:56.725
Took everything I had,
everything I'd stolen from you.


836
01:14:57.192 --> 01:15:00.484
Come, we must hide below decks
before the other passengers arrive.


837
01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:05.898
Merit...

838
01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:08.770
...I don't know how to say this...

839
01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:13.408
Take this with you.
It isn't real gold, but...


840
01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:15.008
...I want you to have it.

841
01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:17.357
It's the symbol
of the Sun God, Aton.


842
01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:19.208
- Perhaps someday...
- No.


843
01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:22.284
We'd only fool ourselves
to think so.


844
01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.486
This is goodbye forever.

845
01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.055
Forever?

846
01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:31.527
You're young, Merit.
Your whole life is before you.


847
01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:36.518
Mine will end somewhere
in the darkness of a foreign land.


848
01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.303
I love you, Sinuhe.

849
01:15:52.549 --> 01:15:54.351
Always remember that.

850
01:15:58.156 --> 01:15:59.775
Hurry, master!

851
01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:11.569
<i>And so I left behind me
the land of my fathers.</i>


852
01:16:15.165 --> 01:16:18.050
<i>And with it, I left my youth
which had promised so much...</i>


853
01:16:18.092 --> 01:16:20.463
<i>...and whose only fruit
had been despair.</i>


854
01:16:27.268 --> 01:16:28.336
<i>As the years passed...</i>

855
01:16:28.536 --> 01:16:31.268
<i>...Kaptah and I traveled
to the ends of the earth.</i>


856
01:16:37.494 --> 01:16:39.263
<i>In the beginning,
we lived as we could.</i>


857
01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:41.531
<i>Friendless wanders that we were...</i>

858
01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:44.601
<i>...we cheated and stole,
in order to live.</i>


859
01:16:54.646 --> 01:16:56.914
<i>We knew heat, hunger, and cold...</i>

860
01:17:00.885 --> 01:17:02.936
<i>...and slept under the stars.</i>

861
01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:08.360
<i>Then, as time softened
my sorrow...</i>


862
01:17:08.927 --> 01:17:12.597
<i>...I began to put to use the skills
I have learned in the School of Life...</i>


863
01:17:12.664 --> 01:17:14.366
<i>...and in my father's house.</i>

864
01:17:18.905 --> 01:17:21.707
<i>As we moved on,
my fame went before me...</i>


865
01:17:21.749 --> 01:17:24.904
<i>...to distant lands, which had
never seen an Egyptian before...</i>


866
01:17:24.946 --> 01:17:26.661
<i>...nor a trained physician.</i>

867
01:17:27.313 --> 01:17:30.212
<i>The simplest cures
were thought to be miracles...</i>


868
01:17:30.516 --> 01:17:33.287
<i>...and I became known
as a worker of magic.</i>


869
01:17:34.888 --> 01:17:38.338
<i>As we traveled on to new lands</i>
<i>our wealth increased.</i>


870
01:17:46.666 --> 01:17:49.728
<i>Everywhere we saw
injustice and misery.</i>


871
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.849
<i>But I hardened my heart.</i>

872
01:17:52.314 --> 01:17:55.322
<i>I reserved my skills
for the rich and the powerful...</i>


873
01:17:55.509 --> 01:17:57.313
<i>...who could pay.</i>

874
01:17:59.254 --> 01:18:02.082
<i>For the children of poverty,
there was no cure.</i>


875
01:18:07.285 --> 01:18:08.887
Cry out when the pain is greatest.

876
01:18:09.054 --> 01:18:11.787
No Hittite warrior
cries out in pain.


877
01:18:12.775 --> 01:18:15.160
- There?
- Yes.


878
01:18:18.363 --> 01:18:19.798
It's as I feared,
Lord Commander...


879
01:18:19.801 --> 01:18:21.144
...your skull must be opened...

880
01:18:21.809 --> 01:18:23.848
...and the evil
removed with a knife.


881
01:18:23.853 --> 01:18:25.312
Is this an Egyptian plot?

882
01:18:25.322 --> 01:18:26.667
To murder our commander
at the time...


883
01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:29.266
At the time when you're planning
war on Egypt?


884
01:18:33.774 --> 01:18:36.443
It was you that brought me here
from Babylon, my Lords.


885
01:18:36.911 --> 01:18:38.679
I take no interest in your plans.

886
01:18:38.682 --> 01:18:41.578
I have no country.
Egypt, least of all.


887
01:18:43.542 --> 01:18:45.510
Shall I undertake your cure?

888
01:18:46.662 --> 01:18:48.430
What chance
have I to survive?


889
01:18:49.298 --> 01:18:50.833
One chance in five.

890
01:18:52.301 --> 01:18:55.637
- If I die, my officers will kill you.
- I know that.


891
01:18:56.305 --> 01:18:57.506
If I live...

892
01:18:57.573 --> 01:18:59.174
...what will you demand?

893
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:08.193
Your sword of black metal.
Nothing more.


894
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.862
- Then you are a spy!
- Doesn't matter.


895
01:19:11.696 --> 01:19:15.466
After the first skirmish our secret
will no longer be secret.


896
01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:19.471
After the second Egypt
will no longer be Egypt.


897
01:19:20.347 --> 01:19:22.082
Proceed, Egyptian.

898
01:19:22.699 --> 01:19:24.568
Shave his head and wash it.

899
01:19:29.666 --> 01:19:31.234
Tie him to this chair securely.

900
01:19:31.301 --> 01:19:33.603
I'll prepare a drug
to dull his pain.


901
01:19:45.131 --> 01:19:46.316
Master. Master.

902
01:19:46.317 --> 01:19:47.803
It's you and not
the Hittite commander...


903
01:19:47.828 --> 01:19:49.751
...who should have a hole
bored in your head.


904
01:19:49.752 --> 01:19:51.319
Why do you even
ask for a sword?


905
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.602
You could have demanded
a fortune.


906
01:19:54.507 --> 01:19:57.336
Because I think this new metal
of the Hittites...


907
01:19:57.794 --> 01:20:00.268
...may change
the history of the world!


908
01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:04.000
And because Horemheb
now commands the army in Egypt.


909
01:20:04.559 --> 01:20:06.027
So you lied.

910
01:20:06.428 --> 01:20:08.238
There is a key
to your heart after all.


911
01:20:08.305 --> 01:20:10.741
Still love your native land.

912
01:20:11.216 --> 01:20:13.255
Master, you will never
go back there.


913
01:20:13.302 --> 01:20:15.304
No pharaoh ever forgives
his enemies.


914
01:20:16.372 --> 01:20:18.450
Leave my instruments
in the flame.


915
01:20:18.674 --> 01:20:20.708
Kaptah, we're going home.

916
01:20:27.316 --> 01:20:28.617
<i>Home.</i>

917
01:20:28.885 --> 01:20:32.388
<i>But Egypt...
Egypt was a stricken land.</i>


918
01:20:32.655 --> 01:20:35.258
<i>Torn by hatred and civil strife.</i>

919
01:20:57.182 --> 01:21:00.123
I fear the Hittites, master,
but I fear this more.


920
01:21:00.165 --> 01:21:02.066
Better if we had never come!

921
01:21:02.987 --> 01:21:04.455
Your name, Syrian?

922
01:21:04.522 --> 01:21:07.345
I am Egyptian.
My name is Sinuhe.


923
01:21:07.459 --> 01:21:09.593
Once physician to the pharaoh.

924
01:21:10.395 --> 01:21:13.178
You must have been bitten
by a rabid ape when you were small.


925
01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.950
You know, that if your name is
on that list of prescribed criminals...


926
01:21:15.952 --> 01:21:17.462
Well, you know the Egyptians.

927
01:21:17.569 --> 01:21:20.527
Seize them!
Take them to headquarters!


928
01:21:20.973 --> 01:21:24.198
There must be some mistake!
Could you go over the list again?


929
01:21:35.321 --> 01:21:36.589
What do you expect me to do?

930
01:21:36.656 --> 01:21:39.076
Bring soldiers here from the Delta?
From the Cataracts?


931
01:21:39.725 --> 01:21:41.527
Your duty is
to keep order in the city.


932
01:21:41.694 --> 01:21:44.050
You should be able to do it
with the men you have!


933
01:22:03.306 --> 01:22:05.234
You were told
to never return to Egypt.


934
01:22:05.942 --> 01:22:07.244
Why did you come back?

935
01:22:07.435 --> 01:22:10.233
It's said that "He who has drunk
of Nile water...


936
01:22:10.778 --> 01:22:13.376
...can never quench his thirst
in other lands."


937
01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:15.118
I know why you're here.

938
01:22:15.627 --> 01:22:18.583
The priests of the old gods
hope to rid themselves of pharaoh.


939
01:22:18.997 --> 01:22:21.533
They whisper that he is mad
and his skull should be opened.


940
01:22:22.834 --> 01:22:25.370
It would be a simple matter
to let the knife slip.


941
01:22:26.254 --> 01:22:28.097
So they brought back to Egypt
the one man...


942
01:22:28.123 --> 01:22:30.337
...who is master
of the operation.


943
01:22:30.683 --> 01:22:32.219
You.

944
01:22:33.754 --> 01:22:36.259
Give me the sword
you took from my servant.


945
01:22:37.190 --> 01:22:38.606
Give it to him.

946
01:22:44.565 --> 01:22:46.914
This is why
I came back to Egypt!


947
01:22:46.967 --> 01:22:49.437
- Draw your sword.
- Stand back.


948
01:22:54.851 --> 01:22:55.955
And now?

949
01:22:57.295 --> 01:22:59.050
Strike at me, hard.

950
01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:01.349
Do you know
what you're asking my friend?


951
01:23:01.416 --> 01:23:02.592
Strike!

952
01:23:06.496 --> 01:23:08.005
Again, harder!

953
01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:13.502
Where did you get this?

954
01:23:13.895 --> 01:23:15.684
In the land of the Hittites.

955
01:23:15.906 --> 01:23:18.100
Hundreds of forgers
are at work there night and day...


956
01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.270
...making weapons of this new metal.
It is called "iron".


957
01:23:29.679 --> 01:23:31.027
Come with me.

958
01:23:43.797 --> 01:23:52.790
<i>How beautiful our God</i>

959
01:23:52.832 --> 01:24:02.001
<i>How beautiful our God</i>

960
01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:05.482
The new temple where
the pharaoh worships his One God.


961
01:24:05.549 --> 01:24:06.784
Look!

962
01:24:20.465 --> 01:24:23.995
I've seen the sorrow this One God
has brought upon Egypt.


963
01:24:23.997 --> 01:24:26.919
It was the priests, not pharaoh,
who brought this sorrow on us.


964
01:24:27.749 --> 01:24:30.775
It was they who blamed
the misfortunes of Egypt on pharaoh...


965
01:24:30.834 --> 01:24:34.255
...and made the people believe that
thus the old gods show their anger.


966
01:24:35.013 --> 01:24:38.469
If I had my way,
I'd hang every priest by his heels.


967
01:24:40.385 --> 01:24:44.106
But our pharaoh believes in repaying
treachery with kindness.


968
01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:46.094
Come.

969
01:25:07.714 --> 01:25:09.378
Stay on your feet.

970
01:25:11.785 --> 01:25:14.625
I apologize, Sire,
for interrupting your prayers.


971
01:25:14.822 --> 01:25:16.123
I have urgent news.

972
01:25:16.190 --> 01:25:18.058
Lord Commander
owes me no explanation.


973
01:25:18.125 --> 01:25:20.134
I bring you someone
that you will remember.


974
01:25:20.294 --> 01:25:21.860
Sinuhe, the physician.

975
01:25:23.197 --> 01:25:26.312
Sinuhe? Yes.

976
01:25:26.734 --> 01:25:29.113
He asks of you
grant him pardon, Sire.


977
01:25:29.412 --> 01:25:32.673
And I, as commander of the army,
also urge you to be merciful.


978
01:25:33.842 --> 01:25:36.321
It is I who should ask
your pardon, Sinuhe.


979
01:25:37.012 --> 01:25:40.649
Once I raised my hand against you.
I would have killed you.


980
01:25:41.316 --> 01:25:43.125
It delights me to see you.

981
01:25:43.827 --> 01:25:46.285
Sinuhe just returned
from the land of the Hittites.


982
01:25:46.914 --> 01:25:48.976
They're preparing
war against us.


983
01:25:49.190 --> 01:25:51.622
They've succeeded
in making a new metal.


984
01:25:52.094 --> 01:25:54.257
He brought this sword as proof.

985
01:25:54.563 --> 01:25:58.099
It cuts through our Egyptian copper
like a knife through straw.


986
01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.102
How could all this be true?

987
01:26:00.469 --> 01:26:02.735
I've sent the Cross of Life
to the Hittite princes.


988
01:26:02.847 --> 01:26:04.507
I promised them my friendship.

989
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:06.253
Akhenaten, my mad friend
do you think...


990
01:26:06.256 --> 01:26:08.644
...they care
for your "Cross of Life"?


991
01:26:08.647 --> 01:26:10.782
They want loot, slaves, power!

992
01:26:10.914 --> 01:26:12.181
And with this...

993
01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:15.323
...they'll get them.

994
01:26:15.551 --> 01:26:17.320
Unless you let me strike first.

995
01:26:17.387 --> 01:26:20.117
Destroy their cities,
their mines, and their forgers.


996
01:26:20.765 --> 01:26:23.031
Are you asking me
to condone slaughter?


997
01:26:23.459 --> 01:26:26.444
I am asking you to show our enemies,
the same mercy they'd show us.


998
01:26:26.446 --> 01:26:28.092
No more, no less.

999
01:26:33.537 --> 01:26:36.673
There's mercy in every man's heart.
If we can only reach it.


1000
01:26:37.608 --> 01:26:39.544
A man who's lived
in darkness all his life...


1001
01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:42.663
...doesn't understand the light
he calls evil, because it hurts his eyes.


1002
01:26:43.227 --> 01:26:46.549
Should we then, extinguish our lights
and crawl into the darkness, with him?


1003
01:26:46.551 --> 01:26:49.154
Such wisdom is already filled
the Nile with corpses.


1004
01:26:50.073 --> 01:26:52.693
Sire, again this morning rioting
broke out on the waterfront.


1005
01:26:52.696 --> 01:26:54.764
I had to send soldiers in
to stop it.


1006
01:26:55.698 --> 01:26:56.797
Don't you see, Sire...

1007
01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.968
...a war now
will unite our country.


1008
01:26:58.972 --> 01:27:00.867
Once again the Egyptians
will stand together...


1009
01:27:00.871 --> 01:27:02.899
...brothers
against a common foe.


1010
01:27:03.688 --> 01:27:05.607
He is right, my husband.

1011
01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:09.361
Even you?

1012
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:12.962
So near to me then
is the darkness?


1013
01:27:12.998 --> 01:27:15.044
You should listen to Horemheb.

1014
01:27:15.868 --> 01:27:17.767
I can listen only to Aton.

1015
01:27:19.313 --> 01:27:20.883
I will write
to the Hittite princes...


1016
01:27:20.925 --> 01:27:23.265
...asking them to make
their intentions clear.


1017
01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.136
Thank you for coming.

1018
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:45.571
Now, do you see
what I have to contend with?


1019
01:27:46.066 --> 01:27:48.635
Could he prevent you from doing
what you want with the army?


1020
01:27:48.866 --> 01:27:51.538
No. The men follow me, not him.

1021
01:27:51.846 --> 01:27:55.134
But he is pharaoh,
and I have sworn him oath of loyalty.


1022
01:27:55.442 --> 01:27:57.644
He'll write to the Hittites!

1023
01:27:58.712 --> 01:28:01.248
He might as well invite them
come take his throne.


1024
01:28:01.423 --> 01:28:02.783
Would it matter?

1025
01:28:02.874 --> 01:28:05.243
I've seen rulers,
great and small...


1026
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:08.280
...old and young,
warlike and effeminate.


1027
01:28:08.347 --> 01:28:11.517
The people suffer and die
whatever the ruler calls himself.


1028
01:28:11.683 --> 01:28:13.919
Hittite, Egyptian, Cretan.

1029
01:28:14.186 --> 01:28:16.491
It's bad to believe
in too much, like pharaoh.


1030
01:28:16.533 --> 01:28:19.314
But it's worse to believe
in too little, my friend.


1031
01:28:19.792 --> 01:28:21.570
I believe in nothing.

1032
01:28:35.041 --> 01:28:37.543
<i>While Egypt tore herself
in civil strife...</i>


1033
01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:41.262
<i>...I doubled my fortune,
as physician to the wealthy.</i>


1034
01:28:44.083 --> 01:28:46.494
Send away the other patients.
I'm tired.


1035
01:28:46.552 --> 01:28:48.020
I will see no more today.

1036
01:28:48.087 --> 01:28:51.383
I think you will see this one, master.
You might find it rewarding.


1037
01:28:51.397 --> 01:28:54.645
- Oh, is the fee so high?
- Not high, but interesting.


1038
01:29:11.711 --> 01:29:13.198
Send her in.

1039
01:29:19.052 --> 01:29:20.748
He'll see you.

1040
01:29:22.688 --> 01:29:24.337
Come again tomorrow.

1041
01:29:24.379 --> 01:29:26.879
I'm very sorry,
there is nothing I can do.


1042
01:29:37.804 --> 01:29:39.432
Can you help me?

1043
01:29:41.007 --> 01:29:42.983
Tell me what ails you.

1044
01:30:08.334 --> 01:30:09.936
Give me your hand.

1045
01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.531
Open your robe.

1046
01:30:44.161 --> 01:30:47.161
I can save your life
but I can't restore your beauty.


1047
01:30:47.197 --> 01:30:49.166
The trouble has eaten
too far for that.


1048
01:30:51.635 --> 01:30:54.381
- Do you want to live, Nefer?
- Yes.


1049
01:30:55.172 --> 01:30:57.053
Yes, I want to live.

1050
01:30:58.442 --> 01:31:01.520
Come back tomorrow morning,
I will undertake your cure.


1051
01:31:05.215 --> 01:31:06.898
I cannot pay you.

1052
01:31:07.684 --> 01:31:10.023
Your collar was all I had left.

1053
01:31:10.495 --> 01:31:12.785
There will be
no fee for my services.


1054
01:31:22.232 --> 01:31:23.370
Here.

1055
01:32:06.276 --> 01:32:10.595
For 10 years I dreamed of this,
of meeting her again.


1056
01:32:11.047 --> 01:32:12.802
When I would be the master.

1057
01:32:14.409 --> 01:32:18.989
Of taking my revenge,
slowly... savoring it.


1058
01:32:20.799 --> 01:32:24.193
What do you feel now
that you have your chance?


1059
01:32:25.829 --> 01:32:27.334
Only pity.

1060
01:32:29.433 --> 01:32:30.689
Sorrow.

1061
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:33.607
Because once,
she was so beautiful.


1062
01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.942
Well, a cat can't help
being what it is.


1063
01:32:40.627 --> 01:32:42.913
It's strange, Kaptah.

1064
01:32:43.897 --> 01:32:48.037
Revenge leaves you as empty
as fame and fortune.


1065
01:32:49.953 --> 01:32:51.521
Eat your fill of all of them...

1066
01:32:52.889 --> 01:32:55.046
...and you're still just as hungry.

1067
01:32:56.359 --> 01:32:59.996
- Master, what is it you want?
- I don't know.


1068
01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:07.271
But whatever it is, I've been searching
for it in the wrong places.


1069
01:33:35.749 --> 01:33:38.970
Master, it's dangerous to walk
in this quarter unescorted.


1070
01:33:39.878 --> 01:33:43.932
Sights, and sounds, and smells,
can make the past live again.


1071
01:33:44.691 --> 01:33:47.434
This is where I used to draw water
for my father.


1072
01:33:49.746 --> 01:33:53.029
It was a long time ago.
Look, Kaptah!


1073
01:33:55.027 --> 01:33:57.821
This is the tree that I learned to climb
when I could barely walk.


1074
01:33:57.824 --> 01:34:00.293
- Leave me alone!
- Come back here!


1075
01:34:00.357 --> 01:34:02.425
- Leave me alone!
- Don't let him get away!


1076
01:34:02.492 --> 01:34:04.728
- Get his cross!
- It's my cross!


1077
01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:06.044
- I got him!
- What are you doing?


1078
01:34:06.046 --> 01:34:06.782
- Give me that cross!
- No!


1079
01:34:06.863 --> 01:34:09.881
Let him alone! Stop that!
Go on! Go on!


1080
01:34:11.868 --> 01:34:13.804
- Are you hurt?
- No.


1081
01:34:14.204 --> 01:34:16.540
- Where do you live?
- Over there.


1082
01:34:17.908 --> 01:34:20.510
- Thoth, my poor darling!
- I'm alright.


1083
01:34:20.677 --> 01:34:22.579
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.


1084
01:34:22.646 --> 01:34:25.081
Some of those other boys
didn't like my cross.


1085
01:34:25.148 --> 01:34:27.249
- I'll take you to a physician.
- May I help?


1086
01:34:29.586 --> 01:34:30.844
Sinuhe!

1087
01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:37.065
Yes, my Lord, you can.

1088
01:34:37.928 --> 01:34:40.110
This is the Lord Sinuhe, Thoth.

1089
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:41.965
A very famous physician.

1090
01:34:44.334 --> 01:34:46.960
- I must get linen for a bandage.
- I'll get it.


1091
01:34:50.674 --> 01:34:54.077
Merit.
After all these years...


1092
01:34:54.845 --> 01:34:56.961
You've been
in my prayers, Sinuhe.


1093
01:34:58.949 --> 01:35:00.417
I'm grateful to your god...

1094
01:35:00.484 --> 01:35:02.758
...if it was he
who brought us together.


1095
01:35:04.921 --> 01:35:06.432
Won't you come in?

1096
01:35:11.695 --> 01:35:13.893
You knew this was
my father's house?


1097
01:35:15.065 --> 01:35:17.601
The house was cheap.
I needed a place of my own.


1098
01:35:17.968 --> 01:35:19.442
You, and your husband?

1099
01:35:20.303 --> 01:35:21.912
I am not married.

1100
01:35:22.347 --> 01:35:25.575
- I found the bandages, mother.
- Mother?


1101
01:35:27.344 --> 01:35:29.012
He's the child
of a friend, an orphan...


1102
01:35:29.014 --> 01:35:31.216
...but he doesn't know that.
He thinks I'm his mother.


1103
01:35:31.481 --> 01:35:33.547
- Sinuhe, please...
- I understand.


1104
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:36.599
Your secret is safe
with this orphan.


1105
01:35:37.454 --> 01:35:38.779
Please come in.

1106
01:35:49.466 --> 01:35:50.975
Here are the bandages...

1107
01:35:51.368 --> 01:35:53.893
...and instruments,
if you have to use them.


1108
01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.903
When I grow up,
I'm going to be a physician too.


1109
01:36:11.021 --> 01:36:13.888
I hope you use these
with more credit than I did.


1110
01:36:19.296 --> 01:36:21.757
I bought them the same time
as I bought the house.


1111
01:36:23.467 --> 01:36:24.959
I see.

1112
01:36:33.677 --> 01:36:35.199
Sit down over there.

1113
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:42.844
Now hold the bandage.

1114
01:36:46.014 --> 01:36:48.825
- This is going to hurt.
- I'm not afraid.


1115
01:36:58.468 --> 01:37:00.337
Have I been
in your prayers too?


1116
01:37:00.403 --> 01:37:04.515
Yes. I prayed that Aton
would teach you humility, and manners.


1117
01:37:04.674 --> 01:37:06.274
Now I know we've come home.

1118
01:37:06.309 --> 01:37:08.011
Only in Egypt,
does a woman's tongue...


1119
01:37:08.078 --> 01:37:10.308
...takes so sharp an edge.

1120
01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:15.846
Now, in two days
you can take off the bandage.


1121
01:37:16.253 --> 01:37:20.190
- But not before, do you understand?
- Why?


1122
01:37:21.191 --> 01:37:23.940
Oh, I mean,
what will happen, if I do?


1123
01:37:24.127 --> 01:37:26.621
Probably nothing.
I spoke sternly to you...


1124
01:37:26.663 --> 01:37:29.533
...because physicians should always
be firm with their patients.


1125
01:37:29.633 --> 01:37:32.210
You'll find out.
It increases their respect for you...


1126
01:37:32.212 --> 01:37:33.998
...and also
the size of your fees.


1127
01:37:34.037 --> 01:37:36.338
But I will be physician
to the poor.


1128
01:37:45.849 --> 01:37:47.717
But the rich have
more interesting ailments...


1129
01:37:47.784 --> 01:37:49.402
...and can better afford them.

1130
01:37:49.719 --> 01:37:52.269
No. I would work for the poor.

1131
01:37:58.495 --> 01:38:00.603
I'm hungry. Are you?

1132
01:38:01.698 --> 01:38:03.618
I could eat a hippopotamus.

1133
01:38:04.901 --> 01:38:06.985
Well, we're having fish.

1134
01:38:08.105 --> 01:38:10.841
- Hurry up, Mother!
- Yes, hurry!


1135
01:38:11.608 --> 01:38:14.478
- Be quiet, both of you.
- Come here.


1136
01:38:14.945 --> 01:38:17.123
Clean your instruments,
and put them away.


1137
01:38:22.819 --> 01:38:24.871
You think you see so much
with your one eye?


1138
01:38:24.873 --> 01:38:26.481
More than my master
does with two.


1139
01:38:26.523 --> 01:38:28.147
- Did you dare to tell him...
- Why should I tell him?


1140
01:38:28.150 --> 01:38:30.214
I like my life as it is,
without a woman...


1141
01:38:30.217 --> 01:38:32.855
...to pour hot water on my feet,
because I displeased her.


1142
01:38:33.008 --> 01:38:35.318
Questioning my accounts,
rationing my beer...


1143
01:38:35.344 --> 01:38:36.424
Hush!

1144
01:38:44.307 --> 01:38:45.399
Merit...

1145
01:38:47.344 --> 01:38:50.861
I didn't ask you to come here,
to pry into my life.


1146
01:38:50.881 --> 01:38:52.610
I didn't expect to...

1147
01:38:54.326 --> 01:38:55.640
Smoke!

1148
01:38:55.905 --> 01:38:58.494
Perhaps you think the smoke
has blinded me too.


1149
01:38:59.790 --> 01:39:02.705
What does the lord Sinuhe,
the great, rich, and cynical...


1150
01:39:02.708 --> 01:39:05.083
...lord Sinuhe,
want with a tavern maid?


1151
01:39:06.396 --> 01:39:09.802
You call me great and rich
but I have nothing.


1152
01:39:10.700 --> 01:39:14.052
I am the poorest of men
because I've wasted my life.


1153
01:39:14.571 --> 01:39:17.348
Everything I ever touched,
I destroyed.


1154
01:39:17.941 --> 01:39:20.444
My birthright, my parents...

1155
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:25.167
Your life too, Merit.

1156
01:39:27.851 --> 01:39:29.519
But you've given me something.

1157
01:39:30.687 --> 01:39:32.229
Perhaps an answer
to the question...


1158
01:39:32.233 --> 01:39:34.863
...I've asked myself
ever since I was a boy.


1159
01:39:37.719 --> 01:39:40.870
Not your god,
because I don't believe in gods...


1160
01:39:42.332 --> 01:39:45.168
...but one thing I created,
which wasn't a waste.


1161
01:39:48.371 --> 01:39:50.678
If it's too late
to live for ourselves...


1162
01:39:51.541 --> 01:39:54.381
...perhaps we can begin
to live for our son.


1163
01:40:03.762 --> 01:40:05.731
Thoth, my boy.

1164
01:40:06.351 --> 01:40:08.954
Let me offer you
a priceless jewel of wisdom.


1165
01:40:09.354 --> 01:40:13.156
Never peer through windows
on matters which don't concern you.


1166
01:40:13.592 --> 01:40:17.233
That's how I happen
to have only one eye.


1167
01:40:41.544 --> 01:40:44.275
Did you intend to pass
without speaking to me?


1168
01:40:47.884 --> 01:40:50.553
I beg Your Highness pardon,
but pharaoh has sent for me.


1169
01:40:50.653 --> 01:40:51.693
I know.

1170
01:40:51.735 --> 01:40:54.485
It's been many years,
physician.


1171
01:40:54.488 --> 01:40:56.256
The look of innocence is gone.

1172
01:40:57.527 --> 01:41:00.763
If Your Highness will excuse me...
- You've heard the news?


1173
01:41:01.014 --> 01:41:02.899
The Hittites
have invaded Syria.


1174
01:41:03.575 --> 01:41:05.795
Their chariots are approaching
the Delta of the Nile.


1175
01:41:05.798 --> 01:41:07.846
- Then the war has begun.
- No!


1176
01:41:08.221 --> 01:41:11.141
My brother's refused to give Horemheb
permission to fight!


1177
01:41:11.558 --> 01:41:13.209
Then he must be mad.

1178
01:41:13.276 --> 01:41:16.525
- I've known that for a long time.
- Physician!


1179
01:41:18.031 --> 01:41:21.355
After you see my brother
come to my chamber.


1180
01:41:28.516 --> 01:41:30.993
- Your Majesty.
- Thank you for coming.


1181
01:41:47.136 --> 01:41:48.325
Sire.

1182
01:41:49.104 --> 01:41:50.272
My friend!

1183
01:41:52.241 --> 01:41:55.677
Sire, you must give Horemhed permission
to defend Egypt.


1184
01:41:55.978 --> 01:41:58.747
No! No!

1185
01:41:59.265 --> 01:42:01.678
Right or wrong,
I will not order death.


1186
01:42:02.401 --> 01:42:05.847
I can not plunge Egypt
into a bath of blood.


1187
01:42:12.697 --> 01:42:14.196
They say I'm mad.

1188
01:42:14.238 --> 01:42:19.523
Horemheb, the priests,
even my own sister.


1189
01:42:20.872 --> 01:42:22.674
Are they right, Sinuhe?

1190
01:42:23.741 --> 01:42:25.545
Am I mad?

1191
01:42:29.281 --> 01:42:31.216
You are mad, Sire.

1192
01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:35.806
But your madness is more beautiful
then the wisdom of other men.


1193
01:42:37.022 --> 01:42:38.508
Beautiful...

1194
01:42:39.491 --> 01:42:42.379
Yes, my vision of Aton
was beautiful.


1195
01:42:42.894 --> 01:42:46.469
I thought it would give peace
and happiness to all men.


1196
01:42:46.498 --> 01:42:48.282
I thought I could be his voice...

1197
01:42:48.324 --> 01:42:50.469
...and bring his message
to my people.


1198
01:42:51.437 --> 01:42:53.363
But I was wrong.

1199
01:42:53.739 --> 01:42:55.653
The vision has faded.

1200
01:42:56.809 --> 01:43:01.485
My voice was no more than
the whisper of wind in the desert.


1201
01:43:02.314 --> 01:43:04.149
Aton has abandoned me...

1202
01:43:05.150 --> 01:43:06.285
...to war...

1203
01:43:07.353 --> 01:43:08.721
...to madness...

1204
01:43:09.321 --> 01:43:10.993
...to the death.

1205
01:43:12.992 --> 01:43:14.694
If you love me, Sinuhe...

1206
01:43:15.495 --> 01:43:18.015
...lift the burden from my soul.

1207
01:43:18.498 --> 01:43:20.474
Give me peace.

1208
01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:33.894
A physician's task
is to prolong life, Sire...


1209
01:43:34.352 --> 01:43:36.196
...not to shorten it.

1210
01:43:41.388 --> 01:43:43.153
He should rest now.

1211
01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:55.125
Can you do anything for him?

1212
01:43:55.803 --> 01:43:59.423
I'm sorry, but his illness
is not of the body, Your Majesty.


1213
01:44:33.208 --> 01:44:34.872
What is it you want?

1214
01:44:34.976 --> 01:44:38.746
What pharaoh himself asked you for:
"to give him peace."


1215
01:44:39.013 --> 01:44:41.654
You have more courage
than I thought.


1216
01:44:41.696 --> 01:44:43.542
If Horemheb
were to learn of this...


1217
01:44:46.521 --> 01:44:48.178
My men are ready!

1218
01:44:48.289 --> 01:44:50.633
The loyal Lord Commander!

1219
01:44:50.675 --> 01:44:51.982
You too?

1220
01:44:52.827 --> 01:44:54.436
Look, Sinuhe...

1221
01:44:55.063 --> 01:44:58.022
...I love Akhnaton,
as I love my own right arm...


1222
01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:01.615
...but if my arm were gangrene,
I'd cut it off.


1223
01:45:01.703 --> 01:45:05.023
Just as Akhnaton
must be cut off from Egypt!


1224
01:45:05.039 --> 01:45:07.208
All Egypt knows that I'm right...

1225
01:45:07.243 --> 01:45:09.711
- ...and you know it!
- Yes.


1226
01:45:09.811 --> 01:45:12.616
Yes, in your place,
I'd tell myself the same thing.


1227
01:45:12.658 --> 01:45:15.669
Have you a potion that
will give him sleep, without pain?


1228
01:45:15.851 --> 01:45:17.085
I'm to kill him...

1229
01:45:17.186 --> 01:45:19.655
...when all around me
there is such a talent for violence?


1230
01:45:19.690 --> 01:45:21.961
Do this, and the gods
will bless you forever.


1231
01:45:22.003 --> 01:45:25.445
I see, you speak for the gods
and Horemheb for Egypt.


1232
01:45:25.694 --> 01:45:29.312
Tell me one thing,
who succeeds to the throne?


1233
01:45:29.398 --> 01:45:32.469
Who else but the commander
of the army that will save Egypt...


1234
01:45:32.471 --> 01:45:35.100
...and make it once more,
the greatest power in the world?


1235
01:45:35.104 --> 01:45:36.322
Yes.

1236
01:45:36.605 --> 01:45:38.373
Horemheb!

1237
01:45:38.941 --> 01:45:41.151
You, pharaoh?

1238
01:45:41.878 --> 01:45:46.158
- So that's the price for your treason.
- Call it treason if you like.


1239
01:45:46.316 --> 01:45:48.918
But there's only one thing
that can save Egypt now...


1240
01:45:49.749 --> 01:45:51.575
...and that's courage.

1241
01:45:51.617 --> 01:45:53.396
Courage to act.

1242
01:45:53.438 --> 01:45:57.244
Courage to conquer our enemies
and put their leaders in chains.


1243
01:45:58.094 --> 01:46:00.530
Akhnaton is in his chamber.
He is helpless.


1244
01:46:00.630 --> 01:46:02.883
Now is your chance to strike.

1245
01:46:03.733 --> 01:46:05.592
But you won't, will you?

1246
01:46:05.634 --> 01:46:08.671
Because no hand has ever been raised
openly against a pharaoh.


1247
01:46:08.688 --> 01:46:10.106
If you strike him down...

1248
01:46:10.108 --> 01:46:12.440
...then the way will be clear,
the precedent established...


1249
01:46:12.443 --> 01:46:14.719
...for someone else to strike down
the next pharaoh...


1250
01:46:14.722 --> 01:46:17.189
...whose name you hope
will be Horemheb.


1251
01:46:17.547 --> 01:46:21.167
So, this dirty thing
must be done by indirection...


1252
01:46:21.484 --> 01:46:23.658
...as it's always
been done in the past.


1253
01:46:24.054 --> 01:46:26.692
By a physician
pretending to heal him.


1254
01:46:27.757 --> 01:46:30.527
By a physician
who's known to be his friend.


1255
01:46:32.829 --> 01:46:34.867
I'm sorry,
but I'm not that man.


1256
01:46:53.918 --> 01:46:55.465
Wait outside.

1257
01:46:58.956 --> 01:47:00.677
Don't go far away.

1258
01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.441
Your Highness wished to see me?

1259
01:47:11.483 --> 01:47:13.219
Are you going to do
what they want?


1260
01:47:13.237 --> 01:47:14.540
No.

1261
01:47:15.139 --> 01:47:18.411
You should agree.
Akhnaton must die.


1262
01:47:19.477 --> 01:47:21.287
For his own sake.

1263
01:47:21.546 --> 01:47:23.748
Now it's for his own sake.

1264
01:47:23.790 --> 01:47:26.136
Mekere, wants to kill him
for the gods...


1265
01:47:26.178 --> 01:47:27.252
...Horemheb for Egypt...

1266
01:47:27.318 --> 01:47:29.278
...and his sister
for his own sake.


1267
01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:31.932
Any hunter will show mercy
to a wounded animal.


1268
01:47:35.193 --> 01:47:37.395
Did they tell you how they plan
to dirty the throne?


1269
01:47:37.395 --> 01:47:39.631
They told me that Horemheb
was to be pharaoh.


1270
01:47:39.731 --> 01:47:42.105
And I'm to be his queen.

1271
01:47:42.147 --> 01:47:44.313
He is to come
to my chamber tonight...


1272
01:47:44.355 --> 01:47:46.375
...and tomorrow our marriage
will be proclaimed...


1273
01:47:46.401 --> 01:47:48.391
...in the temple of the old gods.

1274
01:47:48.433 --> 01:47:50.033
I see.

1275
01:47:50.676 --> 01:47:52.277
A good plan.

1276
01:47:52.444 --> 01:47:55.326
This marriage will make him
acceptable to the people.


1277
01:47:55.368 --> 01:47:57.149
But not to me, physician.

1278
01:47:57.215 --> 01:48:00.207
When I marry, it will be
to no cheese-maker's son.


1279
01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:02.704
Leave!

1280
01:48:06.625 --> 01:48:08.550
We haven't much time.

1281
01:48:08.828 --> 01:48:10.863
Horemheb's men
are in control of the city.


1282
01:48:10.930 --> 01:48:13.886
Tonight the priests will open
and restore the old gods...


1283
01:48:13.899 --> 01:48:15.900
...and make
a sacrifice of blood.


1284
01:48:16.602 --> 01:48:18.562
But together,
we can beat them.


1285
01:48:19.138 --> 01:48:21.890
Horemheb and
all the the evil priests.


1286
01:48:22.575 --> 01:48:24.685
Sinuhe, come here!

1287
01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:29.368
This is what you must do.

1288
01:48:29.410 --> 01:48:31.417
Pretend to fall in
with their plans.


1289
01:48:31.484 --> 01:48:34.356
Kill my brother,
and kill Horemheb too.


1290
01:48:35.021 --> 01:48:37.949
- Two murders.
- Then come to my chamber tonight...


1291
01:48:37.991 --> 01:48:40.193
...and I'll gladly open the doors
with my own hands.


1292
01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:43.249
Willingly share the throne
with you, as pharaoh.


1293
01:48:43.597 --> 01:48:47.284
Why should the people accept
a nameless physician as their pharaoh?


1294
01:48:48.235 --> 01:48:50.886
Because you are pharaoh.

1295
01:48:55.275 --> 01:48:57.427
You're my half brother.

1296
01:48:57.589 --> 01:49:00.055
The only man in Egypt
fit to be my husband...


1297
01:49:00.059 --> 01:49:01.934
...and rule by my side.

1298
01:49:02.215 --> 01:49:04.807
Why do you think
my mother and I sent for you...


1299
01:49:04.810 --> 01:49:06.722
...the day you first came
to the palace?


1300
01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:10.197
Before she died,
she told me everything...


1301
01:49:10.457 --> 01:49:13.663
...and left it to my judgment,
if you should ever hear the truth.


1302
01:49:14.261 --> 01:49:17.862
She was not the first to bare
my father, the pharaoh, a son.


1303
01:49:17.904 --> 01:49:20.264
A few weeks before,
one of his other wives...


1304
01:49:20.267 --> 01:49:23.534
...was delivered
of a boy child... You!


1305
01:49:25.339 --> 01:49:27.204
You were taken away
from your mother...


1306
01:49:27.246 --> 01:49:30.620
...and cast adrift on the river,
in a boat tied with fowler's knots.


1307
01:49:30.662 --> 01:49:34.139
Tied by my mother herself,
who was a fowler's daughter.


1308
01:49:34.782 --> 01:49:38.101
And the mother failed to notice
that her newborn had disappeared?


1309
01:49:38.143 --> 01:49:41.139
She was shown a dead girl baby,
and told it was hers.


1310
01:49:44.225 --> 01:49:46.607
Hundreds of babies
are cast adrift every year...


1311
01:49:46.649 --> 01:49:49.130
...and boats are often tied
with fowler's knots.


1312
01:49:49.196 --> 01:49:51.478
In the Lower Kingdom,
not in Thebes.


1313
01:49:52.734 --> 01:49:55.108
But there is stronger
evidence than that.


1314
01:49:56.237 --> 01:49:57.898
Get my chariot!

1315
01:50:01.376 --> 01:50:04.678
Come with me to the Valley of the Kings,
to my father's tomb.


1316
01:50:04.921 --> 01:50:06.821
See for yourself.

1317
01:50:53.392 --> 01:50:56.001
The Third Amenhotep...

1318
01:50:56.043 --> 01:50:57.817
...the great pharaoh....

1319
01:50:58.426 --> 01:51:00.128
...my father...

1320
01:51:01.555 --> 01:51:02.756
...and yours.

1321
01:51:04.725 --> 01:51:06.303
Look!

1322
01:51:06.727 --> 01:51:08.868
The finest artists
in Thebes made this.


1323
01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:10.695
His exact likeness.

1324
01:51:10.715 --> 01:51:12.393
Look at the nose,
the cheek bones...


1325
01:51:12.396 --> 01:51:14.394
...the forehead,
the line of the jaw.


1326
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:17.481
You wanted further proof.

1327
01:51:23.511 --> 01:51:25.062
Look!

1328
01:51:27.398 --> 01:51:28.680
That's what my mother saw...

1329
01:51:28.682 --> 01:51:30.712
...when you stood before us
in the throne room.


1330
01:51:30.826 --> 01:51:33.537
What no one else, but she,
could recognize.


1331
01:51:33.579 --> 01:51:36.123
The face of her husband
as a young man.


1332
01:51:36.165 --> 01:51:39.260
The great pharaoh come
to life again... in you!


1333
01:51:44.265 --> 01:51:46.633
Now have you any doubts?

1334
01:51:49.904 --> 01:51:51.683
Leave me alone here.

1335
01:53:04.344 --> 01:53:06.214
You know that
I've shown you the truth.


1336
01:53:06.947 --> 01:53:10.091
Yes, now I'm sure
that it's true.


1337
01:53:11.452 --> 01:53:13.736
But would Horemheb
ever accept such proof?


1338
01:53:13.739 --> 01:53:16.642
Of course not. He's eaten up
with his own ambition.


1339
01:53:16.725 --> 01:53:18.158
He's gone much too far.

1340
01:53:18.225 --> 01:53:20.608
He couldn't turn back now,
even if he wanted to.


1341
01:53:20.761 --> 01:53:23.673
That's why he must be killed,
along with Akhnaton.


1342
01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:27.440
You hold Egypt
in your hand, my brother.


1343
01:53:27.835 --> 01:53:29.269
The power
of a god is yours...


1344
01:53:29.336 --> 01:53:31.708
...if only you have
the courage to seize it.


1345
01:53:37.028 --> 01:53:38.131
What's that?

1346
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.794
What is it?

1347
01:53:41.836 --> 01:53:43.722
Horemheb has began
his holy war.


1348
01:53:44.919 --> 01:53:48.226
Every follower of pharaoh's god
has been marked for death.


1349
01:53:49.056 --> 01:53:51.893
- A massacre!
- Why should we care?


1350
01:53:51.895 --> 01:53:54.049
Let Horemheb prepare
the ground for us.


1351
01:53:54.161 --> 01:53:56.113
When my brother is dead,
and we rule...


1352
01:53:56.148 --> 01:53:58.304
...we'll be better off
without these fanatics.


1353
01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:01.335
Let them go!

1354
01:54:39.206 --> 01:54:41.308
Merit! Merit!

1355
01:54:41.408 --> 01:54:43.320
Master! Master!

1356
01:54:45.679 --> 01:54:48.082
- Where's your mother?
- We were separated.


1357
01:54:48.749 --> 01:54:51.038
Kaptah listen,
get the boy down to the docks.


1358
01:54:51.151 --> 01:54:53.413
Here, take this money
and these jewels.


1359
01:54:54.088 --> 01:54:57.057
Find a boat. Buy one.
Steal it if you have to!


1360
01:54:57.124 --> 01:54:58.266
And you?

1361
01:54:58.659 --> 01:54:59.660
I'll find Merit.

1362
01:54:59.727 --> 01:55:02.163
We'll come to you when we can.
But don't wait for us.


1363
01:55:02.187 --> 01:55:03.720
- Get the boy out of the city!
- Yes.


1364
01:55:03.722 --> 01:55:04.876
I want to go with you.

1365
01:55:04.932 --> 01:55:07.212
No. You must go
with Kaptah, my son.


1366
01:55:09.131 --> 01:55:10.137
Now hurry.

1367
01:55:12.615 --> 01:55:13.730
Hurry!

1368
01:55:30.007 --> 01:55:31.111
Stop them!

1369
01:55:35.462 --> 01:55:36.586
Is this yours?

1370
01:55:37.498 --> 01:55:39.109
I never saw it
before in my life.


1371
01:55:39.165 --> 01:55:41.769
You're lying!
I saw you throw it away!


1372
01:55:42.836 --> 01:55:44.337
Be sensible, captain.

1373
01:55:44.339 --> 01:55:46.574
Do I look like a follower
of the accursed Aton?


1374
01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:48.375
They're simple people,
honest people.


1375
01:55:48.442 --> 01:55:50.181
I am the biggest rogue
in all Egypt.


1376
01:55:50.244 --> 01:55:51.922
Is this your cross?

1377
01:55:51.979 --> 01:55:56.348
Captain, you have an honest
and intelligent face.


1378
01:55:57.979 --> 01:56:00.654
I always collaborate with the soldiers.
I a was soldier myself.


1379
01:56:00.658 --> 01:56:04.094
In fact, I gave my eye
for my country.


1380
01:56:04.199 --> 01:56:06.274
- Well if that's all...
- Kill him!


1381
01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:08.952
Kill me for a thousand crimes...

1382
01:56:08.955 --> 01:56:10.786
...but not for one
I never committed!


1383
01:56:11.465 --> 01:56:14.620
I hate the gods!
And the gods hate me.


1384
01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:17.571
Oh, take everything then.

1385
01:56:17.604 --> 01:56:21.108
Take that, jewelry, silver...

1386
01:56:21.175 --> 01:56:22.638
...everything I have.

1387
01:56:31.419 --> 01:56:33.050
You've made a beggar out of me.

1388
01:56:33.076 --> 01:56:35.219
I will starve to death
for as long as I live.


1389
01:56:35.261 --> 01:56:36.323
Let him go!

1390
01:56:38.225 --> 01:56:39.492
Come on!

1391
01:56:40.661 --> 01:56:42.996
What can you pay?
What can you pay?


1392
01:56:43.263 --> 01:56:45.075
Give me your jewels!

1393
01:56:45.099 --> 01:56:47.895
Go aboard! Only those
who can pay can go aboard!


1394
01:56:48.435 --> 01:56:50.907
Give me your jewels!
Give me your gold!


1395
01:56:51.372 --> 01:56:53.594
Only those who can pay
can go aboard!


1396
01:56:53.649 --> 01:56:55.300
Come on, step up!

1397
01:56:56.710 --> 01:57:00.114
Kaptah, how can we pay?
You gave those soldiers everything.


1398
01:57:02.282 --> 01:57:03.790
Not quite everything.

1399
01:57:14.962 --> 01:57:17.226
Savings of a dishonest lifetime.

1400
01:57:17.731 --> 01:57:19.183
Come on! Come on!

1401
01:57:20.267 --> 01:57:22.594
- Please! Please!
- What can you pay?


1402
01:57:22.597 --> 01:57:24.565
Take this ruby.
The child won't take up much room.


1403
01:57:24.648 --> 01:57:25.658
All right, let him go.

1404
01:57:25.739 --> 01:57:27.698
Only those who can pay
can go aboard!


1405
01:57:27.758 --> 01:57:29.778
- Come along!
- There, sit here.


1406
01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.232
Well...

1407
01:57:34.538 --> 01:57:38.176
...I fear that at my age,
and all innocence...


1408
01:57:38.452 --> 01:57:40.249
...I'm becoming a father.

1409
01:57:46.326 --> 01:57:47.581
Thoth!

1410
01:57:51.965 --> 01:57:53.090
Thoth!

1411
01:58:39.146 --> 01:58:40.375
Kneel!

1412
01:58:41.015 --> 01:58:43.567
Aim! Shoot!

1413
01:59:16.358 --> 01:59:17.677
Merit!

1414
01:59:19.228 --> 01:59:20.602
Merit!

1415
01:59:25.159 --> 01:59:26.604
Sinuhe!

1416
01:59:37.379 --> 01:59:38.898
No!

1417
01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:43.344
Merit! Merit!

1418
01:59:50.184 --> 01:59:51.635
Thoth?

1419
01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:54.655
He's with Kaptah.

1420
01:59:55.022 --> 01:59:56.964
With Kaptah he'll be safe.

1421
02:00:04.198 --> 02:00:05.931
Hold me, my love!

1422
02:00:19.513 --> 02:00:20.907
Merit!

1423
02:00:39.667 --> 02:00:41.966
Take the ones that are still alive
to the dungeon!


1424
02:00:42.236 --> 02:00:44.271
I want this temple torn down,
every stone of it!


1425
02:00:44.296 --> 02:00:46.340
- Yes, commander!
- Archers, follow me.


1426
02:00:48.609 --> 02:00:50.690
I'm sorry, my friend.
It had to be done.


1427
02:00:51.045 --> 02:00:53.973
It wasn't you that killed her,
but that madman in the palace.


1428
02:00:55.649 --> 02:00:57.315
He and his One God.

1429
02:00:58.452 --> 02:01:00.821
She believed in his god,
and she's dead.


1430
02:01:03.791 --> 02:01:07.248
- Is he still alive?
- Yes, he's at the palace.


1431
02:01:07.661 --> 02:01:10.321
Then go to the palace
and I'll meet you there before dawn.


1432
02:01:49.067 --> 02:01:50.789
How will you give it to him?

1433
02:01:51.087 --> 02:01:52.204
In a cup of wine...

1434
02:01:52.229 --> 02:01:55.461
- ...when you and I drink with him.
- I?


1435
02:01:56.041 --> 02:01:58.642
We're bound together
in this business, Horemheb.


1436
02:01:58.684 --> 02:02:01.701
As we we've always been bound,
since we were boys together.


1437
02:02:02.147 --> 02:02:04.470
Since what we do
is for the good of Egypt...


1438
02:02:04.617 --> 02:02:07.104
...you should be honored
to have a direct part in it.


1439
02:02:08.988 --> 02:02:10.642
Go and make sure he is awake.

1440
02:02:10.823 --> 02:02:12.566
Arrange for our audience.

1441
02:02:13.492 --> 02:02:17.236
Don't worry.
What's needed, will be in pharaoh's cup.


1442
02:02:57.611 --> 02:03:00.197
You finally came to your senses.

1443
02:03:03.075 --> 02:03:05.196
Why did you leave me there
in the street?


1444
02:03:05.238 --> 02:03:06.278
Where did you go?

1445
02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:08.653
To bury a dream.

1446
02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:11.538
It's dead now and forgotten.

1447
02:03:13.319 --> 02:03:15.029
For pharaoh...

1448
02:03:17.098 --> 02:03:18.590
...for Horemheb...

1449
02:03:21.126 --> 02:03:22.540
For me.

1450
02:03:22.595 --> 02:03:23.838
What do you mean?

1451
02:03:24.497 --> 02:03:26.131
Horemheb's no fool.

1452
02:03:26.232 --> 02:03:29.000
How can I persuade him to drink,
unless I drink as well?


1453
02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:31.875
- But you'll die!
- I'm a physician.


1454
02:03:32.137 --> 02:03:33.672
This oil will smother
the poison...


1455
02:03:33.675 --> 02:03:36.727
...until I can come back here
and swallow this emetic.


1456
02:03:36.851 --> 02:03:38.677
And if something goes wrong?

1457
02:03:40.553 --> 02:03:42.319
Then I'll die in any case.

1458
02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:46.316
Be careful my brother.

1459
02:03:46.352 --> 02:03:47.953
I'll be waiting for you.

1460
02:03:48.153 --> 02:03:50.322
Let's not pretend, my sister,
that our bargain...


1461
02:03:50.325 --> 02:03:52.435
...is for anything but power.

1462
02:03:55.995 --> 02:03:58.574
Perhaps you can't be blamed
for the evil in you.


1463
02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:03.369
It's not your fault
that you were warped and twisted...


1464
02:04:03.373 --> 02:04:06.810
...like a tree forced to flower forever,
and never bear fruit.


1465
02:04:08.115 --> 02:04:10.379
What you are,
you were made to be by others...


1466
02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:14.547
...but I made
the evil in myself...


1467
02:04:14.554 --> 02:04:16.053
...and I know it for evil.

1468
02:04:18.959 --> 02:04:20.246
You must go.

1469
02:04:30.504 --> 02:04:32.779
Sinuhe, open the door.

1470
02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:40.527
Sinuhe!

1471
02:04:47.855 --> 02:04:49.117
Why did you bar the door?

1472
02:04:49.143 --> 02:04:51.711
I couldn't be sure
that it would be you who came.


1473
02:04:54.486 --> 02:04:56.100
Is everything ready?

1474
02:04:56.655 --> 02:04:59.014
He's in the great hall
praying to his One God.


1475
02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:04.225
Which cup is his?

1476
02:05:04.663 --> 02:05:06.433
The one he will take.

1477
02:05:53.563 --> 02:05:54.981
Well, welcome, my friends.

1478
02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:58.127
We come to you as friends, Sire,
for we both love you.


1479
02:05:59.084 --> 02:06:00.329
I know.

1480
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:03.573
We were just speaking of the time
the three of us first met on the desert.


1481
02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:06.452
Yes, it was at sunrise.

1482
02:06:07.726 --> 02:06:10.638
I hoped that day would be
a sunrise for the world.


1483
02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:15.434
But you killed a lion,
his blood spilled out on the sand.


1484
02:06:15.456 --> 02:06:17.571
Violence must be met
with violence.


1485
02:06:18.737 --> 02:06:21.516
Drink, Sire.
To our memories.


1486
02:06:26.412 --> 02:06:28.485
Does Sinuhe invite me to drink?

1487
02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:30.789
Yes.

1488
02:06:46.682 --> 02:06:50.038
Have I drunk... death, Sinuhe?

1489
02:06:51.604 --> 02:06:52.957
Yes, Sire.

1490
02:06:58.777 --> 02:07:00.382
So be it.

1491
02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:07.074
The fault is mine.

1492
02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:11.751
You gave me what I asked for,
but I was wrong to ask it.


1493
02:07:12.758 --> 02:07:14.589
I was weak.

1494
02:07:14.793 --> 02:07:17.285
I thought my god
had forsaken me...


1495
02:07:17.897 --> 02:07:19.822
...but he hadn't, Sinuhe.

1496
02:07:20.065 --> 02:07:22.280
Nor have you killed him,
as you believe.


1497
02:07:23.010 --> 02:07:26.633
Horemheb seeks to kill him
by tearing down his temples...


1498
02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:31.245
...but the house of god
is all creation.


1499
02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:36.047
Tear down the mountains,
empty the seas...


1500
02:07:36.315 --> 02:07:39.049
...strip the sky of stars...

1501
02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.763
...and still
you haven't touched god.


1502
02:07:49.395 --> 02:07:51.483
I see it clearly now.

1503
02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:54.069
I thought God
was the face of the Sun...


1504
02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:56.484
...and thus I made his image.

1505
02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.277
But God is more.

1506
02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:05.743
Much more.

1507
02:08:06.554 --> 02:08:10.305
The sun is just a symbol
of his warmth...


1508
02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:12.508
...of his creative power.

1509
02:08:13.018 --> 02:08:16.180
He is no idol,
no tangible thing...


1510
02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:19.468
...but the creator of all things.

1511
02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:24.130
The loving spirit
that lives in all our hearts.


1512
02:08:25.464 --> 02:08:28.016
I'm fortunate beyond other men...

1513
02:08:28.809 --> 02:08:31.144
...that he permitted me
to recognize him.


1514
02:08:42.131 --> 02:08:45.232
Stay close to me, 
Sinuhe friend.

1515
02:08:48.129 --> 02:08:50.067
I cannot see you well...

1516
02:08:50.289 --> 02:08:52.257
...but there is no pain.

1517
02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:54.748
I gave you no pain, Sire.

1518
02:08:55.895 --> 02:08:58.086
Nor does my death matter.

1519
02:08:58.831 --> 02:09:02.633
I was no more than a shadow
of things to come.


1520
02:09:03.169 --> 02:09:05.461
One voice that spoke for him.

1521
02:09:06.405 --> 02:09:08.774
But there will be other voices...

1522
02:09:09.175 --> 02:09:11.277
...clearer than mine.

1523
02:09:11.644 --> 02:09:14.863
For the hearts of men
will not be denied forever.


1524
02:09:15.848 --> 02:09:17.948
God is in us all...

1525
02:09:19.418 --> 02:09:21.020
...and one day...

1526
02:09:21.687 --> 02:09:24.486
...in his own good time,
he will speak out...


1527
02:09:25.191 --> 02:09:28.197
...in words that
cannot be misunderstood.


1528
02:09:35.034 --> 02:09:37.378
The others lied to me, Sinuhe...

1529
02:09:38.571 --> 02:09:41.340
...but I think
you really loved me.


1530
02:09:47.613 --> 02:09:50.273
God forgives everything, Sinuhe.

1531
02:09:50.983 --> 02:09:52.935
He forgives you.

1532
02:10:03.963 --> 02:10:05.297
Poor soul...

1533
02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:08.238
...he was mad to the end.

1534
02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:12.952
I will make sacrifice
to the gods on his behalf.


1535
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:17.518
They won't refuse me now...

1536
02:10:19.403 --> 02:10:20.964
...for I am one of them.

1537
02:10:22.698 --> 02:10:24.461
I am Egypt!

1538
02:10:27.036 --> 02:10:28.037
Your cup, Sinuhe!

1539
02:10:29.105 --> 02:10:30.306
Drink with me.

1540
02:10:31.774 --> 02:10:34.417
Drink to the beginning
of a new Egypt!


1541
02:10:34.844 --> 02:10:36.438
Horemheb...

1542
02:10:36.712 --> 02:10:38.393
...don't drink it...

1543
02:10:38.914 --> 02:10:40.416
...or you won't be Egypt...

1544
02:10:40.483 --> 02:10:42.071
...or anything.

1545
02:10:46.288 --> 02:10:48.388
You dared!

1546
02:10:48.430 --> 02:10:50.948
Put on the crown
and go to the princess.


1547
02:10:51.827 --> 02:10:55.421
She will be greatly surprised,
for it isn't you she expects.


1548
02:10:55.931 --> 02:10:59.226
But you can prevail,
and make yourself divine.


1549
02:11:00.736 --> 02:11:02.238
You really dared!

1550
02:11:02.304 --> 02:11:04.430
You're the pharaoh
that Egypt wants.


1551
02:11:05.141 --> 02:11:07.220
But that isn't
why I spared you.


1552
02:11:08.043 --> 02:11:10.170
Don't thank me for your life.

1553
02:11:11.147 --> 02:11:13.944
Thank this poor sick fool here.

1554
02:11:15.751 --> 02:11:18.097
For it was he
who saved us both.


1555
02:11:18.354 --> 02:11:20.072
Saved me?

1556
02:11:22.591 --> 02:11:24.059
Are you mad too?

1557
02:11:24.527 --> 02:11:26.252
I am pharaoh!

1558
02:12:56.385 --> 02:12:58.263
Silence!

1559
02:12:58.305 --> 02:13:01.171
Pharaoh comes!
On your faces!


1560
02:13:01.213 --> 02:13:04.092
On your faces
before the Living God!


1561
02:13:54.735 --> 02:13:56.265
Sire!

1562
02:13:56.307 --> 02:13:58.105
The commanders
of the defeated armies...


1563
02:13:58.372 --> 02:14:00.442
...beg mercy of pharaoh.

1564
02:14:01.308 --> 02:14:03.182
I will deal with them later.

1565
02:14:03.911 --> 02:14:05.799
Let the physician come forward!

1566
02:14:16.357 --> 02:14:18.702
- On your knees!
- Let him stand!


1567
02:14:25.466 --> 02:14:27.717
What are the charges
against this man?


1568
02:14:28.536 --> 02:14:31.050
He has publicly spoken
against pharaoh.


1569
02:14:31.092 --> 02:14:34.467
He has belittled pharaoh's victories
in Syria and the land of the Hittites.


1570
02:14:34.508 --> 02:14:36.552
He has blasphemed
against the gods...


1571
02:14:36.555 --> 02:14:39.236
...and committed other acts
of treason, without number.


1572
02:14:39.714 --> 02:14:42.326
Once we stood together
before this throne...


1573
02:14:42.368 --> 02:14:44.223
...and you spoke up for my life.

1574
02:14:46.254 --> 02:14:48.730
Is there anyone here
who will speak up for this man?


1575
02:14:54.161 --> 02:14:56.276
You, my devoted wife?

1576
02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:01.201
No.

1577
02:15:04.438 --> 02:15:06.374
You will have to speak
for yourself, physician.


1578
02:15:06.541 --> 02:15:08.461
Not for myself, Sire...

1579
02:15:09.590 --> 02:15:12.711
...but for one whose memory
you've tried to wipe out.


1580
02:15:13.322 --> 02:15:15.801
Whose very name
you've sought to destroy.


1581
02:15:16.092 --> 02:15:17.293
For Akhenaten!

1582
02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.584
Do you flaunt
your treason in my face?


1583
02:15:19.629 --> 02:15:21.637
That name is forbidden!

1584
02:15:22.132 --> 02:15:23.466
Take care, physician...

1585
02:15:23.566 --> 02:15:26.369
- ...or I will...
- Will? Will? What you will?


1586
02:15:26.936 --> 02:15:29.059
You will go to war,
and win a battle?


1587
02:15:29.305 --> 02:15:32.824
You will conquer, and not know
that it is defeat?


1588
02:15:33.242 --> 02:15:36.663
You will raise Egypt to glory,
and watch her die?


1589
02:15:36.913 --> 02:15:39.865
We live in the twilight
of our world, Horemheb...


1590
02:15:40.416 --> 02:15:42.618
...and you will be it's sunset.

1591
02:15:43.286 --> 02:15:46.022
Nations rise, only to fall.

1592
02:15:46.089 --> 02:15:50.259
Kings build mighty monuments
only to have them crumble into dust.


1593
02:15:50.336 --> 02:15:52.805
Glory flees like a shadow.

1594
02:15:52.972 --> 02:15:56.843
All these things have
the seeds of death in them.


1595
02:15:57.410 --> 02:16:00.046
Only a thought can live.

1596
02:16:00.213 --> 02:16:03.150
Only a great truth
can grow and flourish...


1597
02:16:03.285 --> 02:16:05.518
...and a truth can not be killed.

1598
02:16:05.685 --> 02:16:10.229
It passes in secret,
from one man's heart to another.


1599
02:16:10.525 --> 02:16:13.570
It is given in a mother's milk
to her child.


1600
02:16:13.627 --> 02:16:16.530
Are you trying to tell me
that you'll fight against me?


1601
02:16:16.572 --> 02:16:18.438
Oh, you will win that too.

1602
02:16:18.532 --> 02:16:22.239
For if you fail to silence me,
you know what I'll do.


1603
02:16:22.281 --> 02:16:24.043
What will you do, physician?

1604
02:16:24.171 --> 02:16:26.193
I will go among the people...

1605
02:16:26.907 --> 02:16:30.896
...and try to answer the questions
that burden their hearts.


1606
02:16:31.178 --> 02:16:34.585
The questions that I've asked
myself all my life...


1607
02:16:34.682 --> 02:16:37.335
...wherever I wondered
in the world...


1608
02:16:38.252 --> 02:16:40.365
...and which were answered for me...

1609
02:16:40.921 --> 02:16:42.882
...by a dying man.

1610
02:16:43.824 --> 02:16:45.960
I will wear
the clothes of a slave...


1611
02:16:46.026 --> 02:16:48.349
...and kick the sandals
from my feet...


1612
02:16:49.146 --> 02:16:50.331
...and speak to the wives...

1613
02:16:50.334 --> 02:16:53.751
...as they fry their fish
before their mud huts by the river.


1614
02:16:53.957 --> 02:16:55.736
To the porters on the docks...

1615
02:16:56.103 --> 02:16:58.172
...to the smiths by their bellows...

1616
02:16:58.239 --> 02:17:00.377
...to the slaves
under their yokes...


1617
02:17:00.708 --> 02:17:02.370
...and I will say:

1618
02:17:03.211 --> 02:17:07.043
"A man cannot be judged
by the color of his skin...


1619
02:17:07.085 --> 02:17:11.207
...by his clothes,
his jewels, or his triumphs...


1620
02:17:11.853 --> 02:17:14.287
...but only by his heart.

1621
02:17:14.422 --> 02:17:17.717
A good man is better
than a bad man.


1622
02:17:17.759 --> 02:17:20.440
Justice is better than injustice.

1623
02:17:20.482 --> 02:17:24.841
He who uses mercy is superior
to him who uses violence...


1624
02:17:24.883 --> 02:17:27.047
...though the latter
call himself pharaoh...


1625
02:17:27.050 --> 02:17:29.551
...and make himself
Master of the Earth.


1626
02:17:30.772 --> 02:17:32.846
We have but one master.

1627
02:17:33.107 --> 02:17:35.518
The God who made us all.

1628
02:17:35.777 --> 02:17:38.449
Only his truth is immortal...

1629
02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:42.577
...and in his truth,
all men are equal.


1630
02:17:44.185 --> 02:17:46.323
No man is alone."

1631
02:17:58.033 --> 02:17:59.636
The sentence:

1632
02:18:00.435 --> 02:18:02.566
exile for life!

1633
02:18:29.565 --> 02:18:32.579
<i>I have spent my life
in seeking knowledge.</i>


1634
02:18:33.402 --> 02:18:35.493
<i>This is all I know.</i>

1635
02:18:39.108 --> 02:18:42.155
<i>I have written this
for you, my son...</i>


1636
02:18:42.278 --> 02:18:43.965
<i>...wherever you are...</i>

1637
02:18:44.007 --> 02:18:47.417
<i>...and for your children,
and your children's children.</i>


1638
02:18:48.264 --> 02:18:50.097
<i>It's a poor legacy...</i>

1639
02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:53.061
<i>...but it's all I have.</i>
