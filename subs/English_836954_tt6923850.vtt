00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.760
(tense music)

2
00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:19.197
- Here we go guys, we'll
do it nice and smooth.


3
00:01:27.843 --> 00:01:30.820
Can I have the first wall, please.

4
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.933
House lights on.

5
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.970
First tree, we're gonna
put that on the mark.


6
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.110
That one goes over there,

7
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.858
you'll see the marking.

8
00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:45.358
(tense music)

9
00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.979
(tense music)

10
00:02:37.374 --> 00:02:39.060
(glass shattering)

11
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.233
House lights on.

12
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.590
Can I have the swords, one for Hamlet?

13
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.592
Awesome.

14
00:02:45.592 --> 00:02:46.611
That's the one you practiced with, right?

15
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:47.614
- Ah, yes, I think so.

16
00:02:47.614 --> 00:02:48.447
- The actors can come out.

17
00:02:48.447 --> 00:02:49.850
Ophelia, there she is.

18
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.910
Oh, you look beautiful.

19
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.743
I love this dress.

20
00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm so glad we chose this one.

21
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.414
- I know.

22
00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:56.620
- We're gonna, please go
there with Hamlet and Laertes.


23
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.960
I heard the choreography yesterday
was a little too intense.


24
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.150
What's going on over here?

25
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.720
I saw her spinning before.

26
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.660
Is that like a warmup?

27
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.180
- Yes.
- Is that a thing we do?


28
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.990
So why don't we spin
our way onto the set.

29
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.490
And these candles, this
is for Gertrude's bedroom.


30
00:03:11.637 --> 00:03:12.470
(exhales)

31
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.303
Okay.

32
00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:14.343
Can we smoke it up please?

33
00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:19.554
(tense music)

34
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.583
- Everybody quiet on
set, let's roll sound.


35
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.023
Roll camera.

36
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.053
Great, from the Horatio, scene
one output, take one, mark.


37
00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:48.493
(tense music)

38
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.056
- And action!

39
00:03:53.693 --> 00:03:56.443
(dramatic music)

40
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.713
- Tell my story.

41
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.083
The rest is silence.

42
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.950
- Although of Hamlet,
our dear brother's death,


43
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.443
the memory be green.

44
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.653
The time hath come
to set our grief aside.

45
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.783
Therefore our former
sister, and now our queen,


46
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.683
we became man and wife.

47
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.107
How is it that the clouds
still hang over you?


48
00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:11.000
- Good Hamlet, cast your
mourning clothing off


49
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.793
and let your eye look
down with love on Denmark.


50
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.580
Do not forever with your down cast lids

51
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.353
seek for your noble father anymore.

52
00:05:26.205 --> 00:05:28.038
You know, it's normal.

53
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.570
All that lives must die.

54
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.643
Passing through nature to eternity.

55
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.870
- I know it's normal, Mother.

56
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.870
- If you know, why seems it
then so different with you?


57
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.413
- Seems?

58
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.620
No, it is.

59
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.590
I know not seems.

60
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.970
It's not alone my inky cloak, good mother,

61
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.560
nor customary suit so solemn black,

62
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.560
nor running river in my eye
could describe me truly.


63
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.413
These indeed seem,

64
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.263
for they're the actions
that a man might feign.


65
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.103
What I feel inside, is not pretense.

66
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.309
- It's good and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,


67
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.343
to reverently mourn your father's death.

68
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.730
But to persist in endless
mourning is unmanly grief.


69
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.170
You are direct successor to our throne

70
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.330
and with no less nobility of love,

71
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.140
any caring father bears his son.

72
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.317
I offer up my love to you.

73
00:07:03.805 --> 00:07:06.305
(tense music)

74
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.090
For your intent to go back
now to school at Wittenberg


75
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.660
does go against our
prayers and our wishes.


76
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.340
- We do implore-

77
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.080
- And urge you to remain here,

78
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.490
in the cheer and comfort of our court.

79
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.953
Our foremost courtier
and our cherished son.


80
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.890
- Let not your mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.


81
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.460
Please stay with us.

82
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.010
And don't return to Wittenberg.

83
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.133
- I will obey your wishes,

84
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.173
my dear mother.

85
00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:02.705
(tense music)

86
00:08:22.554 --> 00:08:26.471
Oh that this too, too
sullied flesh would melt,


87
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:35.013
thaw, dissolve itself into a dew.

88
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.199
Or that the everlasting
can not set his laws


89
00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:43.723
against self slaughter.

90
00:08:46.238 --> 00:08:47.071
God, oh God, how weary, stale, flat,

91
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.043
and unprofitable seem to me
all the workings of this world.


92
00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.160
Heaven and earth, must I remember?

93
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.920
Within a month she married
almost wicked speed


94
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.920
to race with such alacrity,
to incestuous sheets.


95
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.430
My God, a beast that
lacks all sense of reason


96
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.730
would have mourned longer!

97
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.060
But she...

98
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.603
Married my uncle.

99
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.193
My father's brother,

100
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:37.290
but no more like my
father than I to Hercules.


101
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:47.033
It cannot and it
will not come to good.

102
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.453
Horatio?

103
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.722
(tense music)

104
00:10:03.722 --> 00:10:05.972
(laughing)

105
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.340
What brings you here from
school at Wittenberg?


106
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.850
- A truant disposition.

107
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:16.640
- I know my fellow
student is not a truant.


108
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.387
- Hamlet, Hamlet, Hamlet!

109
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.323
- Oh.

110
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.530
What a piece of work is a man.

111
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.140
How noble in reason, how
infinite in faculties,


112
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:34.140
informed and moving, how
express and admirable in action.


113
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.870
How, like an angel in
apprehension, how like a-


114
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.573
- God.

115
00:10:48.143 --> 00:10:48.976
(chuckles)

116
00:10:48.976 --> 00:10:53.313
- The beauty of the world,
the Paragon of animals.


117
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.460
And yet to me, what is
this quintessence of?


118
00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:06.030
- Dust.

119
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.370
- There are more things in
heaven and earth Horatio


120
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.013
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

121
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.153
Now, what's brought about
this unexpected visit?


122
00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:27.640
(tense music)

123
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.010
- Your father's unexpected funeral.

124
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.073
- Not my mother's unexpected wedding?

125
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.580
- Her hasty wedding came as a surprise.

126
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.340
- Thrift, thrift, Horatio.

127
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.140
The cooked meats left uneaten
at my father's funeral


128
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.320
were coldly served up
at my mother's wedding.


129
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.153
- Wedding.

130
00:11:46.543 --> 00:11:48.793
(laughing)

131
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.913
- When I had met
my dearest foe in heaven,

132
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.580
than live to see that
hellish day, Horatio.


133
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.853
And throughout it all,

134
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.490
I still see my father.

135
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.323
- See?

136
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.933
Where?

137
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.483
- Here.

138
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.323
And in my mind's eye.

139
00:12:23.332 --> 00:12:24.987
(chuckles)

140
00:12:24.987 --> 00:12:27.363
- He was a goodly king.

141
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.423
- He was a man.

142
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.730
And even with his faults,

143
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.773
I shall not look upon his like again.

144
00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:42.160
(sighing)

145
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.343
- Hamlet...

146
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.880
I think I saw your father,

147
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.133
late last night.

148
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.093
- Saw?

149
00:12:56.093 --> 00:12:58.023
- Yes.
- My father?


150
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.020
- For two nights has the spirit

151
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.520
of your father appeared before me.

152
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.910
- Did he speak?

153
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.260
- He lifted his head as if
to speak, but said nothing,


154
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.150
and vanished before my sight.

155
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.893
- My father's spirit?

156
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.570
- His face was filled
with sorrow and despair.


157
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:37.370
- I fear some foul play
and foul deeds will rise.


158
00:13:41.991 --> 00:13:44.574
(loud thunder)

159
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.493
- Hear me, Hamlet.

160
00:13:48.692 --> 00:13:52.630
I am doomed to walk the
earth until the crimes


161
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:57.630
done to me in my life are
burnt and purged away.


162
00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.580
- Crimes?

163
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:04.483
- If ever you did love your
dearest father, revenge,


164
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.923
my foul and most unholy murder.

165
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:10.623
- Murder?

166
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.193
- Murder most foul.

167
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:17.470
While sleeping in my orchard,

168
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.440
a serpent stung me.

169
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.430
Dear Hamlet, know the serpent
that did take your father's


170
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.323
life now wears his crown.

171
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.033
- My uncle?

172
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.540
- Yes, that incestuous, adulterous beast,

173
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.560
with evil overtures and sensual
lust did seduce with guile


174
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.760
my seeming virtuous queen.

175
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.620
Asleep within my garden,

176
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.080
your uncle stole upon me as I slept

177
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.063
and poured a poison potion down my ear.

178
00:14:57.839 --> 00:15:00.767
And by my brother's hand
was I usurped of life,


179
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.730
of crown, of queen and left for dead

180
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.433
with all my imperfections unconfessed.

181
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.130
Let not the royal bed
of Denmark be a couch


182
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.923
for infidelity, and incest.

183
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.690
Revenge my foul murder or I'm damned.

184
00:15:36.073 --> 00:15:37.583
- Alas poor ghost.

185
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.543
I will remember you.

186
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.100
I will not let your soul be cursed

187
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.730
to walk upon this earth for all eternity.

188
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.613
I will not sleep until you are revenged.

189
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.203
Oh, villain, villain, smiling.

190
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.030
Damn villain.

191
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:09.030
How one may smile,
smile and be a villain.

192
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.883
- The time is out of joint.

193
00:16:24.153 --> 00:16:25.736
- Oh fateful night.

194
00:16:27.935 --> 00:16:32.453
That ever I was
born to set it right.

195
00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:39.439
(dramatic music)

196
00:16:43.295 --> 00:16:45.545
(laughing)

197
00:16:47.187 --> 00:16:52.187
- For Hamlet's letter and
this trifle of his favor.


198
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.623
It is just a passing
fancy and nothing more.


199
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.850
A rose bud in the bloom
of a young man's nature.


200
00:17:06.729 --> 00:17:09.100
Passing, not permanent.

201
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.989
Sweet, nothing more.

202
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:13.390
- Nothing?

203
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.583
- No, nothing.

204
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.489
His high rank means his
will is not his own.


205
00:17:20.489 --> 00:17:22.803
And he is enslaved forever to his birth.

206
00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:26.570
Just think what loss
your honor may sustain


207
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:31.360
if with too trusting
ear, you hear his songs,


208
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.920
or you lose your heart, or...

209
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.820
your chaste treasure open

210
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.993
to his relentless royal overtures.

211
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.913
Fear it, Ophelia.

212
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.830
Fear it and remember my sister dear,

213
00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:02.183
best safety lies in fear.

214
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.900
(tense music)

215
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.630
- I'll keep in mind your
warning while you're gone.


216
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.720
But, dear brother, do not
as some impious pastors do,


217
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:19.650
show me the steep and
thorny path to heaven,


218
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.450
while like a vein and reckless libertine

219
00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:27.343
the path of promiscuity
you take and turn deaf ear


220
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.770
on your own advice.

221
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:34.603
- Fear not.

222
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.347
- Yet here, Laertes?

223
00:18:44.713 --> 00:18:46.770
(stuttering)

224
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:47.870
Abort, abort.

225
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.073
For shame!

226
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.190
The wind sits in
the shoulder of your sail

227
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:59.603
and you're still here.

228
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.713
Fare ye well.

229
00:19:08.516 --> 00:19:11.183
(playful music)

230
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.993
- Most humbly do I take
my leave, dear father.


231
00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:30.243
(grunting)

232
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.450
Remember well, what I've said to you.

233
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.000
- It's locked within my memory.

234
00:19:47.131 --> 00:19:49.631
(tense music)

235
00:19:57.737 --> 00:20:01.290
- What is it Ophelia,
that he has said to you?


236
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.750
- He spoke of something
doing with Lord Hamlet.


237
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:08.073
- Tell me what it is
between both you and Hamlet.


238
00:20:08.073 --> 00:20:10.320
- [Ophelia] He has of late
made many tender shows


239
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.943
of his affection to me.

240
00:20:14.878 --> 00:20:18.600
- And you believe these
tender shows of his?


241
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.053
- I do not know, dear
father, what to think.


242
00:20:26.478 --> 00:20:27.528
- Then I'll tell you.

243
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.033
Stop acting like a little-

244
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.793
Stop acting like a wanton.

245
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.580
- My Lord, he has expressed his love

246
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.380
to me in honorable fashion.

247
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.897
- Aye, fashion you may call it.

248
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.140
Foolish, foolish girl.

249
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.520
- He's sworn the love
he feels for me is true.


250
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.373
- Be wary daughter, of Lord Hamlet's vows.

251
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.423
Do not believe his words
or cunning thoughts.


252
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:11.100
I will not in plain terms
from this time forth,


253
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.553
allow you to spend time
alone with him, or,


254
00:21:15.721 --> 00:21:20.721
you to speak a single word to him.

255
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.410
- I shall obey, my Lord.

256
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.840
(tense music)

257
00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:01.331
(laughing)

258
00:22:02.841 --> 00:22:05.924
(gentle piano music)

259
00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:26.885
(laughing)

260
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.030
(laughing)

261
00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:54.853
- My Lord-

262
00:22:55.758 --> 00:22:58.601
(playful music)

263
00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:01.397
(clears throat)

264
00:23:01.397 --> 00:23:04.064
(playful music)

265
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.633
- Polonius.

266
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.480
Dear Gertrude has says he's found

267
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.293
the very source of
Hamlet's strange behavior.


268
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.773
- I'm sure it's nothing
more than we have discussed.


269
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.770
His father's death and
our over-hasty marriage.


270
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.160
- My Lord, since brevity
is the soul of wit,


271
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.150
I will be brief.

272
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.890
Your noble son is mad,

273
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.670
his madness manifests itself in myriad-

274
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:49.753
- More meaning, with the less art.

275
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.703
- Madam, I swear I
use no art at all.

276
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.510
Lord Hamlet sent this
letter to my daughter.


277
00:24:02.477 --> 00:24:06.273
"To the celestial and
most beauteous Ophelia,


278
00:24:08.477 --> 00:24:10.697
"and her excellent white breasts-

279
00:24:10.697 --> 00:24:12.343
"Bosom, bosom, bosom."

280
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.198
- Hamlet sent this to her?

281
00:24:17.198 --> 00:24:18.443
- Yes, yes, madam.

282
00:24:19.707 --> 00:24:21.637
"Doubt that the stars are higher,

283
00:24:21.637 --> 00:24:23.217
"doubt that the sun is above,

284
00:24:23.217 --> 00:24:25.073
"doubt truth to be a liar,

285
00:24:27.087 --> 00:24:29.396
"but never doubt I love.

286
00:24:29.396 --> 00:24:31.577
(sniggering)

287
00:24:31.577 --> 00:24:35.300
"Oh dear, Ophelia, I am
yours forevermore, Hamlet."


288
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.520
- Has she received his love?

289
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.203
- I gave her stringent
orders that she should not.


290
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.353
That she should lock herself
against any approaches.


291
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.333
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.

292
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.620
Rejection, rejection is the
cause of Hamlet's madness.


293
00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.280
- How can we be certain?

294
00:25:09.153 --> 00:25:13.736
- You know, he always walks
alone there in the hallway.


295
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.397
I'll have Ophelia waiting there for him.

296
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.333
- And?

297
00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:27.970
- We'll hide ourselves and
we'll see what happens.


298
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:32.693
- We will do it.

299
00:25:36.432 --> 00:25:39.182
(dramatic music)

300
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:41.803
- My Lord.

301
00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.460
The player King has arrived.

302
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:53.174
(chuckling)

303
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.673
- Welcome!

304
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.563
Old friend.

305
00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.723
- Thank you my Lord.

306
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.010
- So what shall we have
the actors perform for us?


307
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:13.963
- A comedy?
- No.


308
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:20.370
I once saw you perform a play
called The Murder of Gonzago.


309
00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:23.780
- Aye my Lord.

310
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.170
- Could you perform it tomorrow night?

311
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.360
- Certainly my Lord.

312
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.450
- And could you learn a
speech of some 12 or 16 lines


313
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.283
which I would write for-

314
00:26:30.283 --> 00:26:31.116
- Hamlet.

315
00:26:32.038 --> 00:26:33.663
- Aye, my Lord.

316
00:26:35.561 --> 00:26:38.061
(tense music)

317
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.390
- Then go, make you ready.

318
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.313
You are welcome to Elsinore Castle.

319
00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.460
- Thank you, my Lord.

320
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.490
- My Lord.

321
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.440
Follow me this way.

322
00:27:00.821 --> 00:27:03.404
(tense music)

323
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:21.350
- For all I know, my father's
ghost might be the work


324
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:26.350
of the devil trying to
deceive and damn me.


325
00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.610
I'll have these actors enact the murder

326
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.280
of my father as described
to me by the ghost


327
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.000
before my uncle.

328
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.040
I'll observe my uncle closely.

329
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.803
If he but blink at the
moment of poisoning,


330
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:50.520
I'll know for sure he's guilty, and...

331
00:27:54.767 --> 00:27:56.267
And I'll kill him.

332
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.630
The play's the thing

333
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.810
wherein I'll catch the
conscience of the King.


334
00:28:12.043 --> 00:28:15.146
I swear it, I
swear it, I swear it,

335
00:28:15.146 --> 00:28:17.063
I swear it, I swear it!

336
00:28:18.069 --> 00:28:20.806
(heavy breathing)

337
00:28:20.806 --> 00:28:23.556
(ethereal music)

338
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.450
Father who art in heaven,

339
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.200
hallowed be thy name.

340
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.143
(muttering)

341
00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:11.049
(dramatic music)

342
00:29:28.238 --> 00:29:29.071
To be...

343
00:29:51.561 --> 00:29:52.394
Or...

344
00:30:01.097 --> 00:30:01.930
Not to be.

345
00:30:07.593 --> 00:30:09.173
That is the question.

346
00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:15.580
Whether it is nobler
in the mind to suffer

347
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:20.513
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune.


348
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.533
- Or, take arms against a sea
of troubles and by opposing,


349
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.453
end them.

350
00:30:40.853 --> 00:30:45.313
- To die, to sleep,

351
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:50.383
no more.

352
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.393
- And by sleep, to say-

353
00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:02.330
- We end the heartache of
a thousand natural shocks


354
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:03.553
the flesh is air to.

355
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.830
'Tis a consolation devoutly
to be wished, to die.


356
00:31:17.016 --> 00:31:17.849
- To sleep.

357
00:31:19.801 --> 00:31:22.301
(tense music)

358
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.383
- To sleep,

359
00:31:31.321 --> 00:31:34.283
perchance to dream.

360
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.320
- But in that sleep of death,

361
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.650
what dreams may come when we have shuffled

362
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:45.120
off this mortal coil, this...

363
00:31:49.836 --> 00:31:51.419
must give us pause.

364
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:03.090
- The dread of something after death.

365
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:08.080
- Yes, the undiscovered
country from whose borders


366
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.583
no traveler returns.

367
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:16.630
- And this makes us rather
bare those ills we have.


368
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.780
- Than fight to others
that we know not of.


369
00:32:23.878 --> 00:32:26.045
(sighing)

370
00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.067
- Thus conscience does
make cowards of us all.


371
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.023
- And we lose the name.

372
00:32:42.361 --> 00:32:43.403
- Of action.
- Of action.


373
00:32:48.443 --> 00:32:51.193
(dramatic music)

374
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.860
- Remember me, Hamlet.

375
00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.323
Revenge my foul murder.

376
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.133
Revenge me.

377
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.063
Swear it.

378
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:12.149
- I swear.

379
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:14.539
- Swear it.

380
00:33:14.539 --> 00:33:16.144
- I swear.

381
00:33:16.144 --> 00:33:19.982
I swear it, I swear it,
I swear it, I swear it,


382
00:33:19.982 --> 00:33:22.109
I swear it, I
swear it, I swear it!

383
00:33:22.109 --> 00:33:24.276
(sobbing)

384
00:33:25.567 --> 00:33:29.385
I swear it!

385
00:33:29.385 --> 00:33:31.885
(tense music)

386
00:33:36.486 --> 00:33:39.990
- Get what you can from him.
- I shall, my Lord.


387
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.923
- Ophelia, sit you down here.

388
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:47.350
Gracious King so please you,

389
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:52.350
we will conceal ourselves
behind the tapestry.


390
00:33:59.028 --> 00:34:00.861
Pray you on this book,

391
00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:05.033
with feigned devotion.

392
00:34:08.985 --> 00:34:11.485
(tense music)

393
00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.773
Sit.

394
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:34.333
- How does my Lord
on such a lovely day?

395
00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:36.061
- Well.

396
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:41.943
Well.

397
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.608
Well.

398
00:34:46.608 --> 00:34:49.276
- What are you reading, my Lord?

399
00:34:54.789 --> 00:34:56.128
- Words.

400
00:34:56.128 --> 00:34:57.205
(chuckling)

401
00:34:57.205 --> 00:34:58.038
Words.

402
00:35:02.326 --> 00:35:03.159
Words.

403
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.213
- My Lord.

404
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:15.100
I have this gift
of yours and some poems.

405
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.953
And I ask you now to
kindly take them back.


406
00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:27.923
- No, not I.

407
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.193
I never gave you those.

408
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.353
- My honor, Lord, you know
right and well you did.


409
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:41.373
And with them words of
such sweet breath composed,


410
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.123
made them all the more rich.

411
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.980
Please take these gifts
you gave me back again.


412
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.313
Such gifts prove poor when
the giver proves unkind.


413
00:35:57.046 --> 00:35:59.546
(tense music)

414
00:36:09.202 --> 00:36:11.119
- I did love you, once.

415
00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:16.250
- Indeed, my Lord.

416
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.690
You made me think you did.

417
00:36:23.852 --> 00:36:28.553
- Well, you should not have believed me.

418
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:32.943
I love you not.

419
00:36:35.766 --> 00:36:36.866
- Then I was deceived.

420
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.130
- Are you honest?

421
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.613
- Honest?
- Yes.


422
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:49.123
If so, get thee to a nunnery.

423
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.263
Why would you be a breeder of sinners?

424
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.590
What do you expect from men?

425
00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.463
We are all utter knaves.

426
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.613
Believe none of us.

427
00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.443
Make your way to a nunnery.

428
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.970
Where is your father?

429
00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.490
- At home, my Lord.

430
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.300
- Let the doors be shut upon him

431
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.753
so that he may play the fool
nowhere but in his own house.


432
00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:34.423
Farewell.

433
00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.120
- Oh, help him, sweet heavens.

434
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:43.633
- And if you
must marry, marry a fool.

435
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.160
For wise men know only
too well what monsters


436
00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.063
you make of them.

437
00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.133
To a nunnery, go.

438
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.884
And quickly too.

439
00:37:55.884 --> 00:37:58.384
(tense music)

440
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:05.703
(chuckling)

441
00:38:05.703 --> 00:38:06.536
Farewell.

442
00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.853
- Oh, heavenly powers, restore him.

443
00:38:11.405 --> 00:38:13.905
(tense music)

444
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.810
- I have seen your painted
faces all too often.


445
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:23.190
God has given you one face

446
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.320
and you change it to another.

447
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.900
You dance, you sigh, you flirt,

448
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.863
you cover up your wantonness
with feigned innocence.


449
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.780
Enough.

450
00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.110
I'll no more of it.

451
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:39.747
It has made me mad.

452
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.910
I say that from this day forward,

453
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.160
we will have no more marriages.

454
00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.583
Those that are married
already, shall live on.


455
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:57.337
Except one.

456
00:38:59.489 --> 00:39:01.540
(tense music)

457
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.433
To a nunnery.

458
00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.140
To a nunnery.

459
00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:10.183
Go.

460
00:39:34.028 --> 00:39:36.195
(sobbing)

461
00:39:49.948 --> 00:39:52.531
(gentle music)

462
00:40:02.886 --> 00:40:05.469
(wind rushing)

463
00:40:21.887 --> 00:40:23.530
- It is not so!
- Think for a moment.


464
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.080
- Madness?

465
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.263
Mad for love?

466
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.630
His actions did not
point in that direction.


467
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.040
- Perhaps, but I believe
the origin and cause


468
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.983
of his wild grief resulted
from rejected love.


469
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.230
- I know there's
something in his very soul


470
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.850
on which his melancholy grows and broods.

471
00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:48.480
And I do fear and sense the
end result will lead to danger


472
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.423
which we must prevent.

473
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:57.337
(gentle piano music)

474
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:05.213
He must be sent to England without delay.

475
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.253
His death there has been prearranged.

476
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.193
See to it.

477
00:41:12.193 --> 00:41:15.240
- I will, but if we wait
until the play is over,


478
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:19.850
his mother could all alone
entreat him to speak his mind.


479
00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.760
Let her be blunt with him.

480
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.740
And I, I could stay within ear's range.

481
00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.129
And if she cannot calm him, then I-

482
00:41:27.129 --> 00:41:30.640
- We'll send him on a
fateful trip to England.


483
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:34.247
(chuckling)

484
00:41:34.247 --> 00:41:35.253
(wind rushing)

485
00:41:35.253 --> 00:41:37.573
To England.
- To England!


486
00:41:37.573 --> 00:41:40.073
(tense music)

487
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.263
- Horatio.
- Mm?


488
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.760
- You are as
wise as you are just.

489
00:42:00.488 --> 00:42:01.893
- Am I?
- Yes.


490
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:10.190
And since my soul, mistress of my mind,

491
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:15.380
she has cherished you the
most above all others.


492
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.203
- Me?

493
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.600
- She's chosen you for herself

494
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:30.510
because you are a soul
who is suffering all,


495
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:34.763
has suffered nothing.

496
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:40.610
A man whose fortunes,
downfalls, and rewards you take


497
00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:47.553
with equal grace.

498
00:42:53.226 --> 00:42:54.940
(chuckles)

499
00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:55.773
- Do I?

500
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:04.090
- Give me the man who
is not passion's slave


501
00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:10.390
and I will hold
him in my heart's core.

502
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:15.067
Yes, in my heart of
hearts, as I do you.

503
00:43:19.989 --> 00:43:23.072
(gentle piano music)

504
00:43:43.146 --> 00:43:44.396
- And I do you.

505
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:55.370
- I can't believe
I am alive to say

506
00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.993
my father's murderer's still unpunished.

507
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:09.043
He that killed my
father, whored my mother,


508
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.920
dashed my future hopes, is still alive.

509
00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.023
- How circumstances all
have turned against you.


510
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.830
- Then Denmark has been
turned into a prison.


511
00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:39.930
- Then is the world one?

512
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.670
- Oh, a large one, with many dungeons,

513
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:44.813
Denmark being the worst.

514
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.213
- I do not think so.

515
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:58.550
There's nothing good or bad,
but thinking makes it so.


516
00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:03.410
- Do you not think that
fate calls upon me to smite


517
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.543
my sinful uncle with my sword?

518
00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:11.430
And will I not be damned if I
allow this canker of my being


519
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.413
commit more evil?

520
00:45:13.429 --> 00:45:15.596
(sighing)

521
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.133
- And all the heartfelt
sorrows that beset you,


522
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.333
now spur you to revenge.

523
00:45:27.247 --> 00:45:29.997
(dramatic music)

524
00:45:39.546 --> 00:45:40.446
- There is a scene

525
00:45:44.207 --> 00:45:45.857
that I have written for the play,

526
00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:51.603
which mirrors what the
ghost described to us.


527
00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.823
Observe my uncle.

528
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.550
If his hidden guilt is not revealed

529
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.560
within the opening scene,

530
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.783
it is a demon
ghost that spoke to us.

531
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:16.367
We'll match our thoughts
up when the play is done.


532
00:46:18.204 --> 00:46:20.537
- I'll watch his every move.

533
00:46:23.669 --> 00:46:26.169
(tense music)

534
00:46:28.173 --> 00:46:30.340
(sighing)

535
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.443
- From this time forth,

536
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.863
our thoughts be bloody,

537
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.127
or they be nothing at all.

538
00:47:11.703 --> 00:47:14.453
(dramatic music)

539
00:47:24.974 --> 00:47:27.758
(audience applaud)

540
00:47:27.758 --> 00:47:30.425
(bright music)

541
00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:40.627
- For us and our tragedy,

542
00:47:43.155 --> 00:47:45.405
we welcome you to our play.

543
00:47:48.956 --> 00:47:51.873
(audience applaud)

544
00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.103
- My limbs grow weak,

545
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:07.520
and now I would end the
tedious day with sleep.


546
00:48:10.937 --> 00:48:13.437
(tense music)

547
00:48:21.897 --> 00:48:23.310
- What do you call the play?

548
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.740
- The Mouse Trap.

549
00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.020
The play's a reenactment
of a murder done in Vienna.


550
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.560
Gonzago is the King's name.

551
00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:34.420
It's a navish act, but
what of that, Your Majesty?


552
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.293
For those of us with
sinless souls matters not.


553
00:48:42.238 --> 00:48:43.236
(tense music)

554
00:48:43.236 --> 00:48:46.153
(audience applaud)

555
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:52.310
This is one Lucianus, brother to the king.

556
00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.493
Begin murderer.

557
00:48:55.678 --> 00:48:58.203
Come the croaking raven cries for revenge.

558
00:49:03.956 --> 00:49:07.039
- What black hands poised, drugs set,

559
00:49:10.217 --> 00:49:11.803
the time agreeing.

560
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.120
No mortal is about, no creature seen.

561
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:22.380
Thy mixture rank of
midnight weeds collected,


562
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:26.063
distilled three times to infected.

563
00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.793
With such strength and lethal potency,

564
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:34.647
a healthy soul expires.

565
00:49:44.556 --> 00:49:45.473
Helplessly.

566
00:49:49.257 --> 00:49:52.014
(tense music)

567
00:49:52.014 --> 00:49:54.264
(groaning)

568
00:49:58.715 --> 00:50:01.882
(electricity humming)

569
00:50:03.054 --> 00:50:05.304
(giggling)

570
00:50:13.876 --> 00:50:16.718
(hissing)

571
00:50:16.718 --> 00:50:19.439
(choking)

572
00:50:19.439 --> 00:50:22.272
(wicked laughing)

573
00:50:30.676 --> 00:50:33.509
(wicked laughing)

574
00:50:40.777 --> 00:50:43.694
(audience applaud)

575
00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.393
- You shall see now.

576
00:50:53.051 --> 00:50:55.968
(audience applaud)

577
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:58.363
You shall now-

578
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:05.100
You shall now see how the
murderer gets the love


579
00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.523
of King Gonzago's wife.

580
00:51:08.836 --> 00:51:11.336
(tense music)

581
00:51:16.078 --> 00:51:16.911
- Ah.

582
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.023
- What's wrong?

583
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:23.993
- Lights.

584
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:29.743
Lights.

585
00:51:32.174 --> 00:51:33.007
Give me light!

586
00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:34.973
- Stop the play.

587
00:51:36.777 --> 00:51:39.277
(tense music)

588
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:56.750
- Did you see his face at
the moment of poisoning?


589
00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:01.398
- The ghost spoke the truth.

590
00:52:01.398 --> 00:52:02.250
(laughing)

591
00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:05.030
- Hamlet!
- Polonius.


592
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:06.290
- Come.
- Hamlet-


593
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:07.810
- Some music!

594
00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:09.436
Shall we dance?

595
00:52:09.436 --> 00:52:11.020
- Hamlet, stop!

596
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:11.853
My Lord!

597
00:52:13.298 --> 00:52:16.048
(wind whistling)

598
00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:24.533
The Queen would speak with you, without-

599
00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.953
Without delay.

600
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:41.863
- I will come to
my mother by and by.

601
00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:50.533
- I will say so.

602
00:52:53.716 --> 00:52:55.966
(grunting)

603
00:52:57.639 --> 00:53:02.639
- By and by is easily said.

604
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.780
- Easily, I will say so.
- He will say so.


605
00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.900
- I will!

606
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.196
(mocking barking)

607
00:53:14.196 --> 00:53:15.446
I will say so!

608
00:53:28.898 --> 00:53:31.815
(thunder cracks)

609
00:53:31.815 --> 00:53:34.898
(electricity buzzes)

610
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:48.330
- It is now the very
witching time of night


611
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:54.260
where church yards yawn
and hell itself breeds


612
00:53:56.150 --> 00:54:00.493
out contagion to this world.

613
00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:06.580
But now could I drink hot blood
and do such bitter business


614
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.263
as the day would quake to look on.

615
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.063
And now off to my mother.

616
00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:25.507
Let me be cruel with
her, but not overly so.


617
00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:33.863
I will speak daggers to her,

618
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:40.603
but use none.

619
00:54:48.197 --> 00:54:50.364
(sighing)

620
00:54:55.691 --> 00:54:58.191
(tense music)

621
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:10.833
- Hurry, he's on his way.

622
00:55:19.078 --> 00:55:20.894
(door creaking)

623
00:55:20.894 --> 00:55:22.394
Be blunt with him.

624
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:29.850
I'm going to conceal
myself behind the screen.


625
00:55:34.313 --> 00:55:36.813
(tense music)

626
00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.663
- Mother, mother, mother, mother.

627
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.463
Mother, what's the matter?

628
00:55:58.094 --> 00:56:01.783
- Hamlet, you have your
father much offended.


629
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.170
- Mother, you have my
father much offended.


630
00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:10.910
- Come, come, you answer
with a willful tongue.


631
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:12.900
- Go go, you question
with a wicked tongue.


632
00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:14.463
- Don't speak to me like that.

633
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.013
- What's the matter?

634
00:56:19.013 --> 00:56:20.360
- Have you forgot who I am?

635
00:56:22.372 --> 00:56:24.620
- You are...

636
00:56:29.171 --> 00:56:30.580
the queen.

637
00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:34.200
Your husband's brother's wife.

638
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.903
When it were not
so, you were my mother.

639
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.173
- All right then.

640
00:56:40.173 --> 00:56:42.310
I'll call for those
who'll curb your tongue.


641
00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.663
- You shall not budge or move.

642
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:53.370
Now hold still and look until
you see inside your very soul.


643
00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:01.163
- What?

644
00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:04.063
Will you murder me?

645
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.513
Help!

646
00:57:08.114 --> 00:57:10.614
(tense music)

647
00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:18.823
- How now, a rat.

648
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.873
Dead as a doornail.

649
00:57:29.092 --> 00:57:31.592
(tense music)

650
00:57:47.273 --> 00:57:49.523
(grunting)

651
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:56.000
- What have you done?

652
00:57:57.898 --> 00:58:00.065
(panting)

653
00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:03.290
- Is it the king?

654
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:05.880
- What a rash
and bloody deed is this.

655
00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.123
- A bloody deed.

656
00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:14.500
Almost as bad good
mother, as kill a king

657
00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:17.910
and marry with his brother.

658
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:18.903
- As kill a king?

659
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:21.423
- Yes, Mother.

660
00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:26.960
That's what I said.

661
00:58:28.622 --> 00:58:31.122
(tense music)

662
00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.970
How rash and wretched fool.

663
00:59:04.339 --> 00:59:05.172
Farewell.

664
00:59:07.341 --> 00:59:08.174
Took you for your better.

665
00:59:13.139 --> 00:59:13.972
(tense music)

666
00:59:13.972 --> 00:59:14.805
Take your fortune.

667
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:32.933
You ring your hands.

668
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:37.643
But I will ring your heart.

669
00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.480
- What have I done?

670
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.540
- An act that makes your marriage vows

671
00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.410
as false as gambler's oats.

672
00:59:47.410 --> 00:59:48.243
- What act?

673
00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:54.413
- Look, here, upon this picture.

674
00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:56.853
And...

675
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:05.390
On this, the true to life
depiction of two brothers.


676
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:12.590
Behold, the grace and power of his face.

677
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:16.080
And I like Mars to threaten and command.

678
01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.663
This was your husband.

679
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.353
Look you now what follows.

680
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:29.553
Here is your husband.

681
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:35.620
Like an abscessed ear, pale
against his wholesome brother.


682
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:40.100
Have you eyes?

683
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.463
You turn from this, to this?

684
01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:45.503
What are you, blind?

685
01:00:46.678 --> 01:00:47.600
(chuckles)

686
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.950
Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight.


687
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:53.780
You cannot call it love.

688
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:56.510
For at your age, the
heyday of your passion


689
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:58.990
grows tame and weak.

690
01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.120
Oh blush, have you no shame?

691
01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:04.953
- Hamlet.

692
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:07.773
Speak no more.

693
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.333
You have turned my
eyes into my very soul,

694
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.880
and there I see indelible black spots

695
01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.203
that will not fade away.

696
01:01:22.723 --> 01:01:26.850
- I do not live and wallow
in a rank and loathsome bed,


697
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.670
stewed in corruption
with incestuous sheets.


698
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:32.643
- Don't say another word.

699
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.630
Your words, like daggers through my ears.

700
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:40.027
No more, sweet Hamlet.

701
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:44.960
- A murderer and villain,
a cutthroat of the kingdom


702
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.320
and the state who stole the
crown upon my father's head,


703
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.580
and placed it on his own.

704
01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.060
- No more.

705
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.419
- King of shreds and patches.

706
01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.393
- No more.

707
01:01:57.443 --> 01:01:59.943
(tense music)

708
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:08.890
- I must be
cruel, only to be kind.

709
01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.739
(dramatic music)

710
01:02:12.739 --> 01:02:15.360
(thunder cracking)

711
01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.010
Protect me with your grace
and outstretched wings.


712
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.393
- I come to stir your
soul, to take revenge.


713
01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:25.623
Look there.

714
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:29.553
Amazement on your mother's eyes.

715
01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.383
Go step between her and her tortured soul,

716
01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:38.910
but howsoever you revenge my murder,

717
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:41.520
don't take her life.

718
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.060
Leave her to heaven.

719
01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.013
Speak to her.

720
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:50.950
- Please, do not come before me anymore.

721
01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:55.180
Your soulful look brings
tears into my eyes.


722
01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:59.143
- Revenge me.

723
01:03:06.659 --> 01:03:08.076
- Who do you see?

724
01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.430
With whom do you speak?

725
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:14.100
- Did you see nothing?

726
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.127
- Nothing at all.

727
01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.270
- Nor heard nothing.

728
01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:19.103
- No.

729
01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:25.660
- My father, I saw my father.

730
01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:29.680
- This ghostly appearance is but madness.

731
01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.523
- Save your soul.

732
01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.613
Confess yourself to heaven.

733
01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:55.703
Repent your past.

734
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.473
Avoid a tragic future.

735
01:04:05.022 --> 01:04:06.105
- Oh, Hamlet.

736
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.677
You split my trembling heart in two.

737
01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.733
- I'll throw away the evil part,

738
01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:24.840
and live far purer with the other half.

739
01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:29.958
(tense music)

740
01:04:31.342 --> 01:04:32.503
To England I've been ordered.

741
01:04:35.582 --> 01:04:36.415
- I know.

742
01:04:38.014 --> 01:04:40.597
(solemn music)

743
01:05:00.542 --> 01:05:03.342
- [Hamlet] What is a
man, if the chief goal


744
01:05:03.342 --> 01:05:04.200
and focus of his life

745
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.390
be but to sleep and eat.

746
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:09.640
Once in my heart, 
I had a fear of death

747
01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.437
that would not let me sleep.

748
01:05:11.437 --> 01:05:15.270
But now I see there's
a divinity that shapes


749
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:20.270
all of our ends, no matter
what we will or say or do.


750
01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.280
And life ends faster
than you can count one.


751
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.960
Resign yourself to fate.

752
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.463
Just let it be.

753
01:05:30.258 --> 01:05:31.091
Let it be.

754
01:05:33.139 --> 01:05:35.619
(sobbing)

755
01:05:35.619 --> 01:05:38.819
(dramatic music)

756
01:05:38.819 --> 01:05:42.197
Let it be, let
it be, let it be,

757
01:05:42.197 --> 01:05:45.923
let it be, let it be,
let it be, let it be,


758
01:05:45.923 --> 01:05:47.673
let it be, let it be!

759
01:05:51.859 --> 01:05:52.692
- Cut!

760
01:05:53.857 --> 01:05:56.218
(sobbing)

761
01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:57.051
Cut!

762
01:05:58.142 --> 01:06:01.225
(gentle piano music)

763
01:06:03.539 --> 01:06:06.372
- Let it be, let
it be, let it be.

764
01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:10.299
- Moving on.

765
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.957
- Let it be, let it be.

766
01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:20.433
- Moving on.

767
01:06:22.963 --> 01:06:26.713
- Let it be, let it be,
let it be, let it be.


768
01:06:29.923 --> 01:06:32.673
(dramatic music)

769
01:06:37.182 --> 01:06:40.432
- Where is the handsome son of Denmark?

770
01:06:57.043 --> 01:06:59.022

- They are to blame.

793
01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.650
(laughing)

794
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:55.390
- How long has she been like this?

795
01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:02.100
- Ever since your father's death.

796
01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:08.673
- I will be revenged.

797
01:09:10.537 --> 01:09:13.119
(uneasy music)

798
01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:25.143
- There's rosemary.

799
01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.813
That's for remembrance.

800
01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:31.913
- Kind sister.

801
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.480
Sweet Ophelia.

802
01:09:37.064 --> 01:09:38.481
- Pray you, love.

803
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.903
Remember me.

804
01:09:44.701 --> 01:09:46.701
(gasps)

805
01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:48.753
- Ah heavens.

806
01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.020
Is it possible a young
maid's witch be as mortal


807
01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.352
as an old man's life?

808
01:09:54.904 --> 01:09:57.487
(gentle music)

809
01:10:06.563 --> 01:10:08.646
- There's fennel for you.

810
01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:13.970
And columbines.

811
01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:19.363
That's for infidelity.

812
01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.357
There's rue for you.

813
01:10:35.523 --> 01:10:37.883
That's for repentance.

814
01:10:43.784 --> 01:10:46.990
I would give you some
violets for faithfulness but,


815
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:50.393
they withered when my father died.

816
01:10:51.759 --> 01:10:53.280
- Oh God.

817
01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.093
- Come with me, my child.

818
01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.740
- Come, my coach.

819
01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.340
Goodnight ladies.

820
01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.953
Goodnight, sweet ladies.

821
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:04.850
Goodnight (laughing).

822
01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:06.573
Goodnight.

823
01:11:07.443 --> 01:11:09.610
Goodnight.

824
01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:13.253
- By heaven, her madness will be revenged.

825
01:11:13.253 --> 01:11:15.753
(tense music)

826
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:20.443
- My Lord.

827
01:11:23.758 --> 01:11:26.200
I have a letter here from Lord Hamlet

828
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.663
delivered by sailor.

829
01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:36.146
- "Reverent King,

830
01:11:36.146 --> 01:11:38.737
"know that I've returned to your kingdom.

831
01:11:38.737 --> 01:11:41.316
"I ask your pardon and
beg leave to see you,


832
01:11:41.316 --> 01:11:46.287
"when I shall explain the
circumstances of my return."


833
01:11:48.369 --> 01:11:50.000
- Do you recognize the writing?

834
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.753
- It's clearly Hamlet's hand.

835
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.253
Leave us.

836
01:11:57.016 --> 01:11:59.516
(tense music)

837
01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:03.390
- It cures the
very sickness in my heart

838
01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:05.740
that I shall live to
tell him face to face,


839
01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.663
you are a dead man.

840
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:12.500
- If he comes back,
what would you undertake


841
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.959
to show yourself your father's son,

842
01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:17.000
in deed as well in word?

843
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.570
- I'd cut his throat in church.

844
01:12:19.570 --> 01:12:23.070
- If he returns, 
I shall devise his death

845
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:26.450
in such a way
shall not fail to fall

846
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:28.640
and make it all look like an accident.

847
01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.560
So even Gertrude will not know the truth.

848
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.420
- And I will be
the agent of his fall.

849
01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:38.350
- If he returns, I'll
praise your swordsmanship


850
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:41.070
and challenge him to
meet you in a bout.

851
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:44.270
I'll make a wager he shall outdo you.

852
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:47.750
He, unsuspecting, will not
notice if you use a foil


853
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.923
whose tip you have unblunted.

854
01:12:51.277 --> 01:12:56.277
And thus, you shall revenge
your father's death.


855
01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:59.030
- Hell, when I unblunt my foil,

856
01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:00.360
I'll dip the point in poison

857
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.330
I have brought with me from France.

858
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:06.179
So mortal that a knife that's
dipped in it brings instant


859
01:13:06.179 --> 01:13:07.829
death with just a little scratch.

860
01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:16.153
- In case that fails,
we need a second plan.


861
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:21.602
When from the bout, he
gets a little thirsty,


862
01:13:22.869 --> 01:13:27.403
I'll offer him a drink
that's tinged with poison.


863
01:13:30.097 --> 01:13:32.597
(tense music)

864
01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.430
(dramatic music)

865
01:13:55.090 --> 01:14:00.090
- [Hamlet] What is this
quintessence of dust?


866
01:14:05.319 --> 01:14:10.319
What is this quintessence
of dust, of dust, of dust?


867
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.783
(tense guitar music)

868
01:14:27.277 --> 01:14:29.360
(thunder rumbles)

869
01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.997
- A spade, a spade, for
and a shrouding sheet.


870
01:14:32.997 --> 01:14:33.830
Oh, ah.

871
01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.223
Pit of clay shall soon be made,

872
01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:45.930
for my newest guest to greet.

873
01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:50.690
Oh, ah.
- Whose grave is this?


874
01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:51.553
- Mine, sir.

875
01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:57.119
- I think it yours indeed.

876
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.523
For you lie in it.

877
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:03.320
- You lie outside it, sir.

878
01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.493
Therefore it is not yours.

879
01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:11.369
I do not lie in it.

880
01:15:11.369 --> 01:15:14.298
And yet it is mine.

881
01:15:14.298 --> 01:15:16.548
(laughing)

882
01:15:17.539 --> 01:15:18.490
- You do lie in it.

883
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:21.403
To be in it and say it's yours.

884
01:15:26.619 --> 01:15:28.360
It's for the dead.

885
01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.873
- Therefore you lie for all eternity.

886
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:37.623
- Only the dead lie for all eternity.

887
01:15:37.623 --> 01:15:40.123
(tense music)

888
01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:47.410
- What man did you dig it for?

889
01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:48.660
- No man, sir.

890
01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.890
- What woman then?

891
01:15:49.890 --> 01:15:51.070
- None neither.

892
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:53.119
- Who is it
to be buried in it?

893
01:15:53.119 --> 01:15:55.012
- One who was a woman,

894
01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:01.180
but knowingly drowned herself
and would have been denied


895
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:04.110
Christian burial had
not she had been a lady


896
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:06.623
of good birth and wealth.

897
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:21.213
- How long have
you been a grave maker?

898
01:16:25.050 --> 01:16:28.970
- Since the very first day
that the young Lord Hamlet


899
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:33.193
was born, he that is mad,

900
01:16:35.121 --> 01:16:36.583
and been sent to England.

901
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:39.580
- Why was he sent to England?

902
01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:40.663
- Because he was mad.

903
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.932
He shall recoup his wits there.

904
01:16:46.090 --> 01:16:48.663
If not, it makes no difference there.

905
01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:52.959
- Why?

906
01:16:52.959 --> 01:16:57.959
- Because all the men
there are as mad as he is.


907
01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.553
- How did he become mad?

908
01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.240
- By losing his wits.

909
01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.750
- Upon what ground?

910
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:13.633
- Upon these grounds
right here in Denmark.


911
01:17:17.761 --> 01:17:21.650
- How long will a man live
in the earth before he rots?


912
01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:27.320
- If he's not rotten before he dies...

913
01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:33.063
we have many of those nowadays,

914
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:38.143
it may last eight or nine years.

915
01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:50.193
Here's a skull that's been
laying in the earth for many-


916
01:17:51.238 --> 01:17:52.679
(thunder cracks)

917
01:17:52.679 --> 01:17:53.512
Years.

918
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:55.610
- Whose was it?

919
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:56.983
- This very skull sir?

920
01:18:00.101 --> 01:18:00.934
Who do you think?

921
01:18:00.934 --> 01:18:02.570
- I do not know.

922
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:05.690
- This very skull was Yorick's skull.

923
01:18:05.690 --> 01:18:09.798
The King's jester.

924
01:18:09.798 --> 01:18:12.132
(chuckling)

925
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:14.262
- Sir Yorick.

926
01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:18.090
- This?
- Yes.


927
01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:20.020
- Alas, poor Yorick.

928
01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.850
I knew him well.

929
01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:26.850
Fellow of infinite
jokes, flights of fancy.


930
01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:33.150
He bore me on
his back a thousand times.

931
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:37.160
Here, upon those lips
I kissed as a child.

932
01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.233
I know not how often.

933
01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:46.773
Where be your jibes now?

934
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:52.483
Your songs, your flashes of merriment,

935
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:55.093
that made the courts roar.

936
01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:58.449
(thunder rumbling)

937
01:18:58.449 --> 01:19:01.032
(solemn music)

938
01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:23.240
- Lay her in the earth and
from her fair unpolluted flesh,


939
01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:27.247
may violets spring.

940
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:35.033
- Sweets to the sweet.

941
01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:38.303
Farewell.

942
01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.740
I hoped you would have been Hamlet's wife.

943
01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:48.523
- Ophelia.

944
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:55.060
- Devil take your soul.
- I loved Ophelia.


945
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.100
- Love?

946
01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:57.340
Love you call it?

947
01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:58.740
- Take Hamlet away, Horatio.

948
01:20:01.425 --> 01:20:05.020
And you Gertrude, watch your son closely.

949
01:20:06.919 --> 01:20:09.502
(solemn music)

950
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:23.223
We'll bring an end to this shortly.

951
01:20:24.792 --> 01:20:27.542
(thunder cracks)

952
01:20:37.396 --> 01:20:39.720
(thunder cracks)

953
01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.720
- There's a divinity that
shapes all of our ends.


954
01:20:51.217 --> 01:20:53.467
(grunting)

955
01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:01.903
- You will lose the wager, my Lord.

956
01:21:03.209 --> 01:21:04.993
- I shall win.

957
01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:10.123
But you can't imagine how I feel inside.

958
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.310
- I'm gonna tell the king
you're not fit to fence.


959
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:15.523
- No, no, no, no.

960
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:19.583
We defy fate.

961
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:30.270
There is a special providence
in the fall of the sparrow.


962
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:33.953
If it be now-

963
01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:39.020
- Then it's not to come.

964
01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.633
- And if it be yet to come-

965
01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.297
- It will be now.

966
01:21:45.297 --> 01:21:48.510
- And if it be not now-

967
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:50.983
- Yet, it will come.

968
01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:53.113
- Be ready for it all.

969
01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:57.283
- [Both] Just let it be.

970
01:21:58.316 --> 01:22:01.066
(dramatic music)

971
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:11.743
- Come Hamlet, come
and take Laertes' hand.


972
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:23.493
- Forgive the utter
rashness of my actions.


973
01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:30.100
Excuse my madness and accept my love.

974
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:35.709
- I do receive your love
and I will not wrong it.


975
01:22:39.494 --> 01:22:40.328
- You know the wager?

976
01:22:40.328 --> 01:22:41.340
- I do.

977
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:44.619
- If you should get the
first or second hit,


978
01:22:44.619 --> 01:22:47.343
the king shall drink to
Hamlet's princely skill.


979
01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.533
- My Lords.

980
01:23:05.175 --> 01:23:06.359
Begin!

981
01:23:06.359 --> 01:23:08.609
(grunting)

982
01:23:14.396 --> 01:23:17.217
(chuckling)

983
01:23:17.217 --> 01:23:19.467
(grunting)

984
01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:23.610
(laughing)

985
01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:24.543
- A touch.

986
01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:26.762
- A hit.

987
01:23:28.235 --> 01:23:29.235
A very palpable hit.

988
01:23:30.075 --> 01:23:32.325
(clapping)

989
01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.733
- Come, again.

990
01:23:37.459 --> 01:23:38.293
- Wait.

991
01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.953
Hamlet, have a drink.

992
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:48.023
Come, just a sip.

993
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:51.733
- I'll play this bout first.

994
01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.503
Come, Laertes.

995
01:24:06.155 --> 01:24:07.580
- Begin!

996
01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.830
(grunting)

997
01:24:16.778 --> 01:24:17.610
(laughing)

998
01:24:17.610 --> 01:24:18.444
- Another hit!

999
01:24:19.641 --> 01:24:20.990
What say you?
- A touch, a touch,


1000
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:22.012
I do confess.

1001
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:25.390
(clapping)

1002
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:27.213
- Our son shall win.

1003
01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:31.573
- The queen salutes her
son with all her heart.


1004
01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.810
- I dare not drink yet, Mother.

1005
01:24:42.459 --> 01:24:43.293
Wait a while.

1006
01:24:47.190 --> 01:24:48.340
- To our son's victory.

1007
01:24:50.497 --> 01:24:52.997
(tense music)

1008
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:59.863
- Come, for the third, Laertes.

1009
01:25:02.175 --> 01:25:03.516
(tense music)

1010
01:25:03.516 --> 01:25:06.266
(thunder cracks)

1011
01:25:12.118 --> 01:25:14.368
(grunting)

1012
01:25:21.777 --> 01:25:23.860
- What treachery is this?

1013
01:25:28.615 --> 01:25:29.448
- My son.

1014
01:25:30.535 --> 01:25:33.285
(dramatic music)

1015
01:25:46.455 --> 01:25:47.288
Poison.

1016
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:09.893
- What treachery is this?

1017
01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:12.063
- Hamlet.

1018
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:15.893
You are slain.

1019
01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:23.039
No medicine in the
world can save you now.

1020
01:26:24.539 --> 01:26:27.463
The treacherous instrument
was in your hand.


1021
01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.743
Unblunted and in venom,

1022
01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:42.420
the foul device has
now been turned on me.

1023
01:26:48.502 --> 01:26:49.334
And I die too.

1024
01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.813
I am justly killed by my own treachery.

1025
01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.789
Your mother's poisoned.

1026
01:27:07.884 --> 01:27:09.084
And the King's to blame.

1027
01:27:10.086 --> 01:27:12.836
(dramatic music)

1028
01:27:56.806 --> 01:27:58.389
- Follow my mother.

1029
01:28:14.846 --> 01:28:17.012
(gasping)

1030
01:28:18.785 --> 01:28:21.035
(shouting)

1031
01:28:22.108 --> 01:28:24.858
(dramatic music)

1032
01:28:50.682 --> 01:28:52.432
- Forgive me, Hamlet.

1033
01:28:55.338 --> 01:28:57.838
(tense music)

1034
01:29:32.363 --> 01:29:33.196
- My Lord.

1035
01:29:36.153 --> 01:29:37.343
- I may be dead,

1036
01:29:40.065 --> 01:29:41.015
but you'll live on.

1037
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:54.873
- Not for long.

1038
01:30:00.490 --> 01:30:05.490
- If you ever did
love me, do not do it.

1039
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:17.030
What's happened here
cannot be left unknown.


1040
01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.203
Tell my story.

1041
01:30:37.867 --> 01:30:39.534
The rest is silence.

1042
01:30:52.865 --> 01:30:55.032
(sobbing)

1043
01:31:26.385 --> 01:31:28.968
(gentle music)

1044
01:31:39.237 --> 01:31:42.580
- [Horatio] Let me speak
to the yet unknowing world,


1045
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.182
how these things came about.

1046
01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.900
Bloody and unnatural acts

1047
01:31:50.650 --> 01:31:54.070
of deaths brought on by
evil, cunning and deceit,


1048
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:57.030
all this will I truly tell.

1049
01:32:00.801 --> 01:32:03.301
(tense music)

1050
01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:33.253
(gentle music)

1051
01:35:46.696 --> 01:35:49.779
(gentle piano music)
