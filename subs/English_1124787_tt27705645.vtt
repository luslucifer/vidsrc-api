1
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.541
Good morning, honey.

2
00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:16.084
Hi, mom.

3
00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:19.077
Ok.

4
00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:20.263
Yeah, you can let go now.

5
00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:25.343
You ready for our
mother-daughter day?


6
00:01:25.345 --> 00:01:26.720
Absolutely.

7
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:30.891
What do you think?

8
00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:33.834
No color?

9
00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:36.687
The country club matrons are
leaving their mark on you.


10
00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.450
Well, it's for the
maddisons' new beach house.


11
00:01:40.452 --> 00:01:43.069
And I do color, occasionally.

12
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:45.363
Well, in that case,
you should help me


13
00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:46.530
Decorate my new dorm room.

14
00:01:46.532 --> 00:01:47.874
I was thinking a mural,
maybe a field


15
00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:50.410
Of sunflowers,
lots of greens and yellows,


16
00:01:50.412 --> 00:01:51.945
And a blazing blue sky.

17
00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:54.380
Now you're pushing it.

18
00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:56.199
That's far too much color.

19
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.101
Is dad meeting us for lunch?

20
00:01:58.103 --> 00:01:59.277
No, honey.

21
00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:00.961
He's far too busy at work today.

22
00:02:00.963 --> 00:02:04.865
But this is going to be
the best summer ever, right?


23
00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:06.117
It's your last one here.

24
00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.052
It's not our last summer, mom.

25
00:02:08.054 --> 00:02:10.246
I'm going to be back
for the holidays.


26
00:02:10.248 --> 00:02:11.747
It's not enough.

27
00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.316
Ok, debbie downer.

28
00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:14.884
Let's go shopping.

29
00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:16.161
Ok.

30
00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:17.712
So what do you think
you're going to need


31
00:02:17.714 --> 00:02:19.146
For your freshman year?

32
00:02:19.148 --> 00:02:21.657
Well, I really like
these shoes that...


33
00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:32.502
All right.

34
00:02:32.504 --> 00:02:33.987
I was thinking
that maybe we could


35
00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.580
Go to giorgio's and get
that chicken and goat


36
00:02:36.582 --> 00:02:37.657
Cheese and apple salad.

37
00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.066
Ooh, that salad is so good.

38
00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:40.401
And we could split it maybe.
- Yes.


39
00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:42.011
'cause it's so big.
- It's huge.


40
00:02:42.013 --> 00:02:43.513
Maybe we could get the
triple-chocolate cake.


41
00:02:43.515 --> 00:02:44.814
Good morning, ladies.
- Hi.


42
00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:46.182
Hey, sasha.

43
00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:47.817
Well, I was going to
ask you to go for a run,


44
00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.803
But I see you ladies are
going out on the town.


45
00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:52.639
Yeah, mom's taking me
shopping and for lunch.


46
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:54.273
How fun.

47
00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.684
Ooh, love the braids, honey.

48
00:02:55.686 --> 00:02:56.826
Well, thank you.

49
00:02:56.828 --> 00:02:58.027
Very cool.

50
00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.086
It's a new look I'm trying.

51
00:02:59.088 --> 00:03:00.480
Well, it suits you.

52
00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:02.098
Doesn't she look nice, roxanne?

53
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.691
She does.

54
00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:05.652
Macie's trying out this
college student look


55
00:03:05.654 --> 00:03:08.429
While she can, because when
she starts practicing law,


56
00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:10.173
It's all business suits
and blowouts.


57
00:03:10.175 --> 00:03:13.267
You have all your life
to play by the rules.


58
00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.527
Have fun while you can.

59
00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:15.953
That's my motto.

60
00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:17.180
I will.

61
00:03:17.182 --> 00:03:18.681
I mean, that's
what college is for...


62
00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:21.275
To let your hair down
away from your parents.


63
00:03:21.277 --> 00:03:22.443
And classes.

64
00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:23.794
There's classes too.

65
00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:25.371
Right, right, classes.

66
00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:27.056
Very important.

67
00:03:27.058 --> 00:03:28.224
That's what it's all about.

68
00:03:28.226 --> 00:03:29.300
Right, macie?

69
00:03:29.302 --> 00:03:30.283
Right.

70
00:03:30.303 --> 00:03:31.511
And some fun, I hope.

71
00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:32.595
Yes.

72
00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:33.696
Of course, honey.

73
00:03:33.698 --> 00:03:36.065
I mean, all work and no play?

74
00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:37.684
Speaking of which,
we should get going.


75
00:03:37.686 --> 00:03:39.318
The mall waits for no one.
- Right.


76
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.054
Well, I'll catch you
later for coffee, roxanne?


77
00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:43.898
Sounds great.

78
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.466
Morning.

79
00:03:45.468 --> 00:03:50.046
Allow me to introduce our head
of the board, mark robinson.


80
00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:54.475
Now, mark volunteers his
time and his legal expertise


81
00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:56.143
To the project.

82
00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:57.587
We'd be nowhere without him.

83
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:59.647
- Mark.
- Good morning.


84
00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:00.630
Welcome.

85
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.149
Thank you for coming.

86
00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:03.242
Great intro, my man.

87
00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.914
Look, our aim in this project
is that the homeless become


88
00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:11.242
Our neighbors, not the
problem, through housing


89
00:04:11.244 --> 00:04:14.253
Them in a small house within
the host property grounds.


90
00:04:14.255 --> 00:04:18.332
Now, the added incentive
is that after four years,


91
00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:21.018
The property becomes
yours free of charge,


92
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.063
Ok, after your
guests have moved on.


93
00:04:23.065 --> 00:04:26.690
Now, we have an extensive
waiting list of new neighbors


94
00:04:26.692 --> 00:04:28.935
Going to host new families.

95
00:04:28.937 --> 00:04:30.361
And...

96
00:04:30.363 --> 00:04:32.572
And we provide
a full-support service


97
00:04:32.574 --> 00:04:34.698
For both hosts and neighbors.

98
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.260
And it's this
unique support that


99
00:04:37.262 --> 00:04:39.262
Makes this project so special.

100
00:04:39.264 --> 00:04:43.375
We all know the benefits
of a good neighbor, right?


101
00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.199
Sit up straight, honey.

102
00:04:52.201 --> 00:04:53.551
Come on.

103
00:04:53.553 --> 00:04:56.387
There you go.

104
00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.765
I feel bad that dad
had to work today.


105
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.225
Don't feel too bad, honey.

106
00:05:01.227 --> 00:05:02.643
Your dad loves his work.

107
00:05:02.645 --> 00:05:04.270
I don't know what
he'd do without it.


108
00:05:04.272 --> 00:05:06.405
He just seems stressed lately.

109
00:05:06.407 --> 00:05:07.590
Have you noticed?

110
00:05:07.592 --> 00:05:09.475
He's just got a lot going on.

111
00:05:09.477 --> 00:05:11.093
I just wish he'd
take some time off.


112
00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:14.221
You know, I miss him sometimes,
and I'm going to be gone soon.


113
00:05:14.223 --> 00:05:15.204
I just...

114
00:05:15.224 --> 00:05:16.649
I know, sweetheart.

115
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:19.318
Your dad's just got a really
full plate with his charity


116
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.805
And his practice, and you
know how much the tiny house


117
00:05:22.807 --> 00:05:24.398
Project means to him.

118
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.086
But he is so proud of you for
following in his footsteps.


119
00:05:29.088 --> 00:05:31.147
I don't want to end up like dad.

120
00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:34.183
Always working with no
time for anything else?


121
00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:35.334
It's...

122
00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:37.428
You'll make time
for what matters.


123
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.646
Trust me.

124
00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:41.823
Sure.

125
00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:43.009
I'll take care of things.

126
00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:44.268
You have my word.

127
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.828
Great session today, mark.

128
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.513
Looks like we'll have even
more tiny houses set up soon.


129
00:05:47.515 --> 00:05:48.665
Yeah, great.

130
00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:49.699
The community really needs them.

131
00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:50.774
Yeah.

132
00:05:50.776 --> 00:05:51.867
Shoot.

133
00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:54.203
I'll see you later.

134
00:05:54.205 --> 00:05:56.263
There'll be more spaces
available tomorrow.


135
00:05:56.265 --> 00:05:58.992
We can get them in asap.

136
00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:00.076
Great.

137
00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:13.797
Hey, hey, hey!

138
00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:15.282
Somebody called looking for you.

139
00:06:15.284 --> 00:06:16.843
Who?
- A man.


140
00:06:16.845 --> 00:06:17.893
Didn't say.

141
00:06:17.895 --> 00:06:19.228
Wouldn't leave a message.

142
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.248
Probably just some random creep.

143
00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:28.738
Paradise motel.

144
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.872
<i>Lucy willis, please.</i>

145
00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:30.805
Yeah.

146
00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:32.658
You just missed her.

147
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.826
You want to leave a message?

148
00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:46.472
Another day in paradise.

149
00:06:46.474 --> 00:06:48.041
Don't get too comfortable.

150
00:06:48.043 --> 00:06:49.775
I just got in, mom.

151
00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:51.001
Give me a break.

152
00:06:51.003 --> 00:06:53.379
You need to start packing.

153
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:56.574
Is this about the
man who keeps calling?


154
00:06:56.576 --> 00:06:59.702
Mom, are we ever
going to stop running?


155
00:06:59.704 --> 00:07:02.454
The receptionist just told
me someone tried calling...


156
00:07:02.456 --> 00:07:04.182
Again.

157
00:07:04.184 --> 00:07:06.083
Is it him?

158
00:07:06.085 --> 00:07:07.176
Not going to be a problem.

159
00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:08.937
We're hitting the road again.

160
00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:13.107
Don't tell me you
found somewhere.


161
00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:14.792
I told you I would.

162
00:07:14.794 --> 00:07:17.403
I told you this would
only be temporary.


163
00:07:17.405 --> 00:07:19.797
Trust your mother.

164
00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:20.923
Hold on.

165
00:07:20.925 --> 00:07:22.275
It's not another motel, is it?

166
00:07:22.277 --> 00:07:23.376
No.

167
00:07:23.378 --> 00:07:24.602
No more motels.

168
00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:32.935
Come on.

169
00:07:32.937 --> 00:07:35.630
Get packing.

170
00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:41.218
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.554
I know I said I was
going to make it,


172
00:07:42.556 --> 00:07:44.931
But there's no way
I can do it today.


173
00:07:44.933 --> 00:07:47.116
I know I promised.

174
00:07:47.118 --> 00:07:49.302
Ok. Ok.

175
00:07:49.304 --> 00:07:53.231
I'll see what I can do later.

176
00:08:25.073 --> 00:08:27.998
I need to talk
to you about something.


177
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.378
The tiny house project found
someone for us to host.


178
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.097
Well, that's great news, honey.

179
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:36.282
When do we start?

180
00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:39.452
Like, a month, two months?

181
00:08:39.454 --> 00:08:40.686
Tomorrow.

182
00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:42.688
Tomorrow?

183
00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.616
Honey, we weren't supposed to
start this until after macie


184
00:08:45.618 --> 00:08:47.777
- Goes to college.
- I know. I know.


185
00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:49.953
But it's a single mom
and her daughter,


186
00:08:49.955 --> 00:08:52.181
And they really need
a safe place to live.


187
00:08:52.183 --> 00:08:53.683
Mark.

188
00:08:53.685 --> 00:08:56.110
Look, I'm head of the board,
and I need to lead by example.


189
00:08:56.112 --> 00:08:57.895
The tiny house is up now,
and it's


190
00:08:57.897 --> 00:09:01.390
Just sitting there being empty
when people really need it.


191
00:09:01.392 --> 00:09:02.708
I love how much you care, honey.

192
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.691
I really do.

193
00:09:03.711 --> 00:09:06.279
It's just... I don't know.

194
00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:08.431
Are... are we ready for this?

195
00:09:08.433 --> 00:09:09.699
Are you kidding me?

196
00:09:09.701 --> 00:09:10.850
All the training you've done?

197
00:09:10.852 --> 00:09:13.886
You're going to be
an amazing host.


198
00:09:13.888 --> 00:09:15.646
But two people
is a very different


199
00:09:15.648 --> 00:09:16.856
Dynamic than just one.

200
00:09:16.858 --> 00:09:18.374
I know.

201
00:09:18.376 --> 00:09:20.910
But you wouldn't want
to separate a daughter


202
00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:22.061
And a mother, would you...

203
00:09:22.063 --> 00:09:23.303
No.

204
00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:27.133
When you could
keep them together?


205
00:09:27.135 --> 00:09:29.202
Ok.
They can stay.


206
00:09:31.147 --> 00:09:34.407
I am so proud to be your
husband, roxanne robinson.


207
00:09:37.729 --> 00:09:39.011
Here.

208
00:09:41.423 --> 00:09:42.589
What's this?

209
00:09:42.591 --> 00:09:43.800
Open it.

210
00:09:49.774 --> 00:09:50.755
Honey.

211
00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:52.666
You like it?

212
00:09:52.668 --> 00:09:53.851
I love it, honey.

213
00:09:53.853 --> 00:09:58.188
Thank you.
I love it so much.


214
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.613
It's cute.

215
00:10:22.615 --> 00:10:25.341
I am so excited
for them to see it.


216
00:10:32.016 --> 00:10:33.632
Um, what are you doing?

217
00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.568
Before and afters.

218
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.378
I can do so much
with this space.


219
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.939
I mean, everything's here.

220
00:10:39.941 --> 00:10:43.233
It just doesn't have
that sense of home yet.


221
00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:44.660
No warmth, you know?

222
00:10:44.662 --> 00:10:46.154
Well, you don't know what
they'll bring with them.


223
00:10:46.156 --> 00:10:48.230
I mean, maybe they'll
make it homey.


224
00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:49.556
Maybe.

225
00:10:49.558 --> 00:10:51.558
But some prints and
some decorations in here


226
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.061
Would make this a
completely new room.


227
00:10:54.063 --> 00:10:56.456
You can do a lot
with a small space.


228
00:10:56.458 --> 00:10:58.232
Well, I really
hope they like it.


229
00:10:58.234 --> 00:11:00.326
They're going to love it.

230
00:11:00.328 --> 00:11:02.161
I can't wait to meet them.

231
00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:03.588
Me too.

232
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.548
Come on.

233
00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:11.020
Wow.

234
00:11:11.022 --> 00:11:11.986
You weren't kidding, mom.

235
00:11:12.006 --> 00:11:14.114
This is nice.

236
00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:17.176
Very nice.

237
00:11:19.898 --> 00:11:21.421
I wonder which house is ours.

238
00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:27.152
Come on.

239
00:11:41.352 --> 00:11:44.703
Home, sweet home.

240
00:11:49.377 --> 00:11:51.377
Mom.

241
00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:54.347
He won't find us here, right?

242
00:11:54.349 --> 00:11:56.715
Security is a
promise of the program.


243
00:11:56.717 --> 00:11:59.685
We'll be safe here.

244
00:11:59.687 --> 00:12:01.854
Trust me.

245
00:12:01.856 --> 00:12:04.056
It is pretty great.

246
00:12:04.058 --> 00:12:05.775
And it's ours.

247
00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:11.989
Somebody left us a present.

248
00:12:18.981 --> 00:12:20.206
"welcome to your new home.

249
00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:21.574
"from your new
neighbors and friends,


250
00:12:21.576 --> 00:12:24.393
Roxanne, mark,
and macie robinson."


251
00:12:24.395 --> 00:12:26.629
Look.
This must be our host family.


252
00:12:26.631 --> 00:12:28.831
Yeah.

253
00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:30.174
That's nice of them.

254
00:12:33.178 --> 00:12:35.304
I think we're going to
do great here, baby.


255
00:12:38.183 --> 00:12:40.117
So what do you think?

256
00:12:40.119 --> 00:12:41.585
I think they're
going to love it.


257
00:12:41.587 --> 00:12:44.121
I mean, it's just supposed
to be a small token.


258
00:12:44.123 --> 00:12:45.339
Right.

259
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:47.600
So what do you know
about your new neighbors?


260
00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:49.343
You mean our new neighbors?

261
00:12:49.345 --> 00:12:51.279
They're going to be
living next to you too.


262
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:52.780
They're really your neighbors.

263
00:12:52.782 --> 00:12:56.600
I mean, they're practically
on your doorstep.


264
00:12:56.602 --> 00:12:58.761
Well, it's a mom and daughter.

265
00:12:58.763 --> 00:13:01.463
And honestly,
I'm just happy that we


266
00:13:01.465 --> 00:13:04.708
Can give them a safe home.

267
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.859
Well, happy housewarming.

268
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:07.611
Thank you.
I love it.


269
00:13:07.613 --> 00:13:08.795
Isn't it beautiful?

270
00:13:11.942 --> 00:13:15.369
Don't get me wrong, I will
not miss the paradise motel,


271
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:18.931
But it's so quiet here.

272
00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:20.040
That's a good thing...

273
00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:21.601
No prying eyes.

274
00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:25.020
As long as we keep our
heads down, we'll be fine.


275
00:13:25.022 --> 00:13:28.023
Remember, even with your
friends, be discreet.


276
00:13:28.025 --> 00:13:29.642
What friends?

277
00:13:29.644 --> 00:13:32.645
I bet there are tons of
kids around here your age.


278
00:13:32.647 --> 00:13:34.647
Rich kids.

279
00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:36.315
Give it a chance, lucy.

280
00:13:36.317 --> 00:13:39.601
This is a great opportunity
for us to get back on our feet.


281
00:13:39.603 --> 00:13:42.229
And the best part about it is
no one comes through that


282
00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:43.212
Door uninvited.

283
00:13:52.508 --> 00:13:55.350
Hi, ella, I'm roxanne robinson,

284
00:13:55.352 --> 00:13:56.652
And this is my daughter, macie.

285
00:13:56.654 --> 00:13:58.353
Hi.
- Hi, roxanne.


286
00:13:58.355 --> 00:13:59.672
Nice to meet you.

287
00:13:59.674 --> 00:14:01.674
I hope we're not coming
at an inconvenient time.


288
00:14:01.676 --> 00:14:03.909
We just wanted to
stop by and introduce


289
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:05.661
Ourselves and give you this.

290
00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:09.439
It's just a few essentials
to help you get settled in.


291
00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:10.607
Thank you.

292
00:14:10.609 --> 00:14:12.818
That's kind of you.

293
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.344
Come on in.

294
00:14:14.346 --> 00:14:16.388
You can leave the plant there,
give it some sun.


295
00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:20.859
Lucy, come say hi.

296
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:22.361
This is my daughter, lucy.

297
00:14:22.363 --> 00:14:25.331
This is roxanne and
macie, our new neighbors.


298
00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:26.957
Hi.
- Hi, lucy.


299
00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:29.459
- Welcome.
- Hey, lucy.


300
00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:31.937
Lucy, you and macie will
have to hang out together.


301
00:14:31.939 --> 00:14:33.872
She can show you all
around the neighborhood


302
00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.708
And tell you all
about the school.


303
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.801
I'm sure you guys
have loads in common.


304
00:14:37.803 --> 00:14:40.637
Yeah, I'd be happy to
show you around, lucy.


305
00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:42.348
Thanks.

306
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.016
I'd offer you
a coffee, but we're


307
00:14:44.018 --> 00:14:45.625
Still getting unpacked here.

308
00:14:45.627 --> 00:14:47.052
Don't worry about it.

309
00:14:47.054 --> 00:14:50.039
We don't want to intrude.

310
00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:51.540
Well, thanks for coming by.

311
00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:54.468
Actually,
I wanted to see if maybe we


312
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.487
Could do the welcome
supper tonight just to get


313
00:14:57.489 --> 00:14:59.115
Any questions sorted out.

314
00:14:59.117 --> 00:15:00.240
Tonight?

315
00:15:04.163 --> 00:15:07.573
Well, I suppose,
though we only just got here.


316
00:15:07.575 --> 00:15:08.891
It can wait, mom.

317
00:15:08.893 --> 00:15:09.908
Right?

318
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.910
It'll be really informal.

319
00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:14.596
It's just a chance for us to go
over how everything will work.


320
00:15:14.598 --> 00:15:16.173
It's part of the welcome week.

321
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:19.101
Sure.

322
00:15:19.103 --> 00:15:20.051
Thanks.

323
00:15:20.071 --> 00:15:21.344
It'll save me cooking.

324
00:15:21.346 --> 00:15:22.512
Great.

325
00:15:22.514 --> 00:15:23.739
Well,
we'll see you tonight then.


326
00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:34.416
Macie is so excited
about starting in the fall.


327
00:15:34.418 --> 00:15:37.677
I'm even trying to get her
to rush my old sorority.


328
00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:39.071
My gosh.

329
00:15:39.073 --> 00:15:42.457
Having her follow in your
footsteps... how cute.


330
00:15:42.459 --> 00:15:45.911
So how are the new neighbors?

331
00:15:45.913 --> 00:15:47.187
I mean, I'm not sure.

332
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:49.498
They seem nice.

333
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.625
So what's the problem?

334
00:15:51.627 --> 00:15:55.387
Well, I tried to look
for them on social media


335
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:57.940
To try to get a feel for them,
you know.


336
00:15:57.942 --> 00:15:59.592
A surprise to no one.

337
00:15:59.594 --> 00:16:02.035
And I couldn't find
anything about them online.


338
00:16:02.037 --> 00:16:03.979
I mean, isn't that weird?

339
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:07.224
I mean, not everybody
has a perfect life


340
00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:08.650
Or a family to share.

341
00:16:08.652 --> 00:16:12.913
I mean,
you're a lucky woman, roxanne.


342
00:16:12.915 --> 00:16:15.382
Cute necklace.

343
00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:17.884
Thank you.

344
00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:19.719
Mark got it for me.

345
00:16:19.721 --> 00:16:21.888
He's an old romantic.

346
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.467
Yes, he is.

347
00:16:32.409 --> 00:16:35.086
Put the new glasses
on the table for me, macie.


348
00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:39.322
Macie?

349
00:16:39.342 --> 00:16:41.649
- Earth to macie?
- I know, mom.


350
00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:43.252
Just give me two seconds.

351
00:16:43.254 --> 00:16:45.137
Who are you texting?

352
00:16:45.139 --> 00:16:47.865
No one.

353
00:16:47.867 --> 00:16:50.175
I thought this was
going to be informal.


354
00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:51.751
Well, it is.

355
00:16:51.753 --> 00:16:54.663
I just want it to look nice
to show we made an effort.


356
00:16:54.665 --> 00:16:57.366
Maybe we should have
done this later, mom.


357
00:16:57.368 --> 00:16:59.025
It is their first night.

358
00:16:59.027 --> 00:17:01.854
No, honey, the training
stressed the importance


359
00:17:01.856 --> 00:17:03.756
Of hitting the ground running.

360
00:17:03.758 --> 00:17:05.991
Lucy seemed really nice.

361
00:17:05.993 --> 00:17:07.350
Yeah.

362
00:17:07.352 --> 00:17:08.828
You know, I know she's
a little younger than you,


363
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.103
But I really think
that you could


364
00:17:10.105 --> 00:17:11.354
Be a good influence on her.

365
00:17:11.356 --> 00:17:14.041
I mean, you're a
straight-a student, honey.


366
00:17:14.043 --> 00:17:16.919
You know, there's more
to me than school, mom.


367
00:17:19.047 --> 00:17:20.237
I know that.

368
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.801
Ok, will you do me a favor?

369
00:17:24.803 --> 00:17:27.972
Call your dad, make sure he
gets home on time tonight.


370
00:17:27.974 --> 00:17:31.600
I am going to go pick
some roses for the table.


371
00:17:31.602 --> 00:17:35.220
Ok.

372
00:17:39.318 --> 00:17:40.709
Great minds.

373
00:17:40.711 --> 00:17:42.361
I was just about to pick
some roses for my table too.


374
00:17:42.363 --> 00:17:43.879
I'm glad you like them.

375
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:45.989
I won't be
putting these anywhere.


376
00:17:45.991 --> 00:17:48.099
I've never liked roses.

377
00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:50.585
Wait, you're
pulling them all out?


378
00:17:50.587 --> 00:17:52.421
Yep.

379
00:17:52.423 --> 00:17:54.390
Last one.

380
00:17:54.392 --> 00:17:56.258
Something about the smell, this,

381
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.878
Like, horrible,
over-the-top perfume


382
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.829
That gets in your nose.

383
00:18:04.685 --> 00:18:06.910
If you're going that way,
would you mind


384
00:18:06.912 --> 00:18:09.104
Taking these to the trash?

385
00:18:09.106 --> 00:18:10.037
Yeah, sure.

386
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.603
I think it's pretty
cool that you got two


387
00:18:24.605 --> 00:18:26.088
People living in your garden.

388
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.523
They're not living
in our backyard, ryan.


389
00:18:28.525 --> 00:18:30.242
They have a house
on the grounds.


390
00:18:30.244 --> 00:18:31.443
On the grounds?

391
00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:34.704
It sounds so bougie
when you say that.


392
00:18:34.706 --> 00:18:36.448
whatever.

393
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.517
Mom is totally smothering them.

394
00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:40.944
Now, that doesn't surprise me.

395
00:18:40.946 --> 00:18:44.806
When do I get the official
intro to your parents?


396
00:18:44.808 --> 00:18:48.944
When they've learned how
to chill out, so never.


397
00:18:48.946 --> 00:18:50.429
That's a shame.

398
00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:53.782
I guess I'll just have you
all to myself instead then.


399
00:19:01.066 --> 00:19:06.069
So our role as the host
family is to help you


400
00:19:06.071 --> 00:19:09.448
And lucy feel a part
of your new neighborhood.


401
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.907
What does that entail?

402
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:12.742
Well, for instance,
we could assist


403
00:19:12.744 --> 00:19:14.336
You in finding work, ella.

404
00:19:14.338 --> 00:19:16.497
If that's something
you're interested in.


405
00:19:18.768 --> 00:19:23.111
And, lucy, macie can show you
all around the neighborhood


406
00:19:23.113 --> 00:19:26.106
And tell you all
about the school.


407
00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:29.426
We just want to be the
best neighbors that we can.


408
00:19:31.672 --> 00:19:33.505
I really appreciate the offer,

409
00:19:33.507 --> 00:19:36.666
But lucy's already
enrolled in school,


410
00:19:36.668 --> 00:19:40.186
And I have a job
interview tomorrow.


411
00:19:40.188 --> 00:19:41.354
That's fantastic, ella.

412
00:19:41.356 --> 00:19:42.398
That's great.

413
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.815
Thanks.

414
00:19:43.817 --> 00:19:45.483
You know, I actually
have a suit that I think


415
00:19:45.485 --> 00:19:47.844
Would look really good
on you if you want


416
00:19:47.846 --> 00:19:49.946
To borrow it for tomorrow.

417
00:19:49.948 --> 00:19:51.706
Thanks, but I know
how to put myself


418
00:19:51.708 --> 00:19:53.701
Together for a job interview.

419
00:19:55.479 --> 00:19:56.611
Of course.

420
00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:58.289
I'm sorry.

421
00:20:01.285 --> 00:20:02.483
Hey, lucy.

422
00:20:02.503 --> 00:20:04.536
You want to go see my room?

423
00:20:04.538 --> 00:20:06.547
Sure.

424
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:17.215
Any problems with the house?

425
00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.868
Everything's working just fine.

426
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.997
Yeah, which reminds me,

427
00:20:23.999 --> 00:20:27.042
I have some
general information here


428
00:20:27.044 --> 00:20:29.044
To help you get settled in...

429
00:20:29.046 --> 00:20:32.655
Recycling, bin collection
days, bus routes,


430
00:20:32.657 --> 00:20:37.227
Stuff like that,
and good neighbor guidelines.


431
00:20:37.229 --> 00:20:39.421
Good neighbor guidelines?

432
00:20:46.747 --> 00:20:48.747
"no loud noise after 10:00 p.M.

433
00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:51.216
No social gatherings
of over six people?"


434
00:20:51.218 --> 00:20:53.493
Yeah, those are just
general guidelines.


435
00:20:53.495 --> 00:20:56.847
Everybody gets them.

436
00:20:56.849 --> 00:20:58.423
Did you get them?

437
00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:03.670
Well, we didn't write them.

438
00:21:03.672 --> 00:21:06.582
They're just part
of the agreement.


439
00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:19.194
Yeah, well, our party
days are well behind us.


440
00:21:20.331 --> 00:21:22.081
But if there's anything in there

441
00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:25.017
That you don't like
or seem unfair,


442
00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:27.102
You can talk to us about it.

443
00:21:34.302 --> 00:21:36.228
This is it.

444
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.462
Wow.

445
00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.622
This is like a fancy hotel room.

446
00:21:39.624 --> 00:21:42.208
We were staying in a motel
before we lived here.


447
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.501
A motel?

448
00:21:43.503 --> 00:21:46.321
Yeah, but it was
nothing like this...


449
00:21:46.323 --> 00:21:48.624
Not even in the same universe.

450
00:21:48.626 --> 00:21:50.609
It's so neat in here.

451
00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:52.628
Where's all your stuff?

452
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.889
Mom's a big fan of storage.

453
00:21:55.891 --> 00:21:57.899
You like sideshow?

454
00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.100
Yeah.

455
00:21:59.102 --> 00:22:00.827
Yeah, they're my favorite band.

456
00:22:00.829 --> 00:22:02.228
Me too.

457
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.389
I am so in love with johnny.

458
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:05.523
He's so hot.

459
00:22:05.525 --> 00:22:06.850
Who's your favorite?

460
00:22:06.852 --> 00:22:08.126
Johnny too.

461
00:22:08.128 --> 00:22:09.261
Are you serious?

462
00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:10.646
He's already mine.

463
00:22:10.648 --> 00:22:13.339
I already said that we're
going to be together.


464
00:22:13.341 --> 00:22:15.801
I'm not going
to fight you for him.


465
00:22:15.803 --> 00:22:17.836
Did you hear they're
playing at the sun festival


466
00:22:17.838 --> 00:22:18.987
This weekend?

467
00:22:18.989 --> 00:22:20.246
Yeah.

468
00:22:20.248 --> 00:22:21.974
Are you going to go?

469
00:22:21.976 --> 00:22:24.250
My friends are, but I'm busy.

470
00:22:24.252 --> 00:22:25.978
What could be more
important than seeing


471
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.164
Your favorite band playing?

472
00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:32.258
My boyfriend is going, but
mom and dad would definitely


473
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.277
Not want me going with him.

474
00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:35.654
Why not?

475
00:22:35.656 --> 00:22:37.322
Well, for a start,
they don't even know about him.


476
00:22:37.324 --> 00:22:40.108
He's not exactly part
of the country club set.


477
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.795
Yeah, but your parents
aren't dating him, are they?


478
00:22:43.797 --> 00:22:47.106
It's none of their business.

479
00:22:47.108 --> 00:22:50.352
Maybe.

480
00:22:50.354 --> 00:22:51.853
Are you seeing anyone?

481
00:22:51.855 --> 00:22:55.007
No, but I'm waiting
for a country club boy


482
00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:56.299
To sweep me off my feet.

483
00:23:04.643 --> 00:23:08.169
I was thinking that maybe
you could take lucy out today...


484
00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:10.730
Take her shopping, go to lunch.

485
00:23:10.732 --> 00:23:11.806
My treat, obviously.

486
00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:12.899
Yeah.

487
00:23:12.901 --> 00:23:14.133
Yeah, that sounds fun.

488
00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:15.861
I think lucy would
really like that.


489
00:23:15.863 --> 00:23:16.986
Yeah.

490
00:23:16.988 --> 00:23:18.413
I do too.

491
00:23:18.415 --> 00:23:21.824
It's just yesterday
was so awkward, you know?


492
00:23:21.826 --> 00:23:23.368
And I just really
want to do something


493
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.470
Nice for ella and lucy.

494
00:23:25.472 --> 00:23:26.571
Like what?

495
00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:28.373
Well,
I was thinking that I could


496
00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:31.926
Spruce up the house while
ella is at her job interview.


497
00:23:31.928 --> 00:23:32.860
Ok, yeah.

498
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.339
That sounds nice.

499
00:23:37.092 --> 00:23:38.099
Hey, mom?

500
00:23:38.101 --> 00:23:39.568
Hmm?

501
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.160
A couple of my friends
are going to the sun festival


502
00:23:41.162 --> 00:23:43.513
This weekend,
and I'd really like to go.


503
00:23:43.515 --> 00:23:45.757
Sideshow is headlining
on Saturday.


504
00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:49.018
Honey, we already have
our spa weekend booked.


505
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.838
And I don't think
a festival is a good idea.


506
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:56.752
I mean, you've got drugs and
alcohol and camping and dirt.


507
00:23:56.754 --> 00:23:58.436
Right, but I won't be
doing anything illegal.


508
00:23:58.438 --> 00:24:01.573
I know, honey, but a lot
of people around you will be.


509
00:24:01.575 --> 00:24:04.892
And it's just not
a very safe environment.


510
00:24:04.894 --> 00:24:08.296
Well, they're my favorite band.

511
00:24:08.298 --> 00:24:11.482
You're going to be a lot
happier at a five-star hotel.


512
00:24:11.484 --> 00:24:13.318
Trust me on this.

513
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.287
You're going to thank me.

514
00:24:36.326 --> 00:24:38.735
So tell me more about
the secret boyfriend.


515
00:24:38.737 --> 00:24:39.795
What's his name?

516
00:24:39.797 --> 00:24:41.237
Ryan.

517
00:24:41.239 --> 00:24:42.831
He was at my school
a couple of years above me,


518
00:24:42.833 --> 00:24:44.332
But he dropped out.

519
00:24:44.334 --> 00:24:45.575
He's a musician.

520
00:24:45.577 --> 00:24:47.235
He plays guitar in a band.

521
00:24:47.237 --> 00:24:48.327
Cool.

522
00:24:48.329 --> 00:24:49.938
I know.

523
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.248
He's working at a coffee shop
until he gets his big break,


524
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.343
But he's really talented.

525
00:24:55.345 --> 00:24:57.162
But you're worried
about something.


526
00:24:57.164 --> 00:24:58.404
I don't know.

527
00:24:58.406 --> 00:25:00.665
He's just older than me,
and he's way cooler.


528
00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:03.685
And I don't want him
thinking I'm, like, this...


529
00:25:03.687 --> 00:25:06.004
Swanky rich kid with no edge.

530
00:25:06.006 --> 00:25:07.080
Yeah.

531
00:25:07.082 --> 00:25:09.023
Exactly.

532
00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:12.728
I've got just the thing.

533
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.088
Why don't you get a piercing?

534
00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.197
A piercing?

535
00:25:16.199 --> 00:25:17.482
You're 18.

536
00:25:17.484 --> 00:25:19.108
It's about time you do
something for yourself.


537
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.427
And I'll get one with you.

538
00:25:21.429 --> 00:25:24.339
What do you say?

539
00:25:24.341 --> 00:25:25.431
Ok.

540
00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:26.541
Why not?

541
00:25:26.543 --> 00:25:28.844
Excellent.

542
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:48.546
Hey, honey.

543
00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:49.681
Hey.

544
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.886
That's new.

545
00:25:54.888 --> 00:25:57.722
I got one too.

546
00:25:57.724 --> 00:25:59.073
Relax, dad.

547
00:25:59.075 --> 00:26:01.409
It's no big deal.

548
00:26:01.411 --> 00:26:02.485
Ok.

549
00:26:02.487 --> 00:26:05.380
Let's see what mom says.

550
00:26:18.319 --> 00:26:20.153
What the hell?

551
00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.252
Hi, ella.

552
00:26:27.254 --> 00:26:28.269
You look great.

553
00:26:28.271 --> 00:26:29.337
How did the interview go?

554
00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:30.939
Did you redecorate my home?

555
00:26:30.941 --> 00:26:32.273
I did.

556
00:26:32.275 --> 00:26:33.558
You don't like it?

557
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.427
Roxanne,
that was pretty intrusive.


558
00:26:35.429 --> 00:26:37.270
Well, I just wanted to
add some finishing touches


559
00:26:37.272 --> 00:26:38.337
To make it more homey.

560
00:26:41.868 --> 00:26:47.406
I think you should give
your spare key to me, please.


561
00:26:47.408 --> 00:26:49.023
We are supposed
to hold on to a key


562
00:26:49.025 --> 00:26:50.516
As part of the agreement.

563
00:26:50.518 --> 00:26:53.845
And the agreement says
that I have a right to privacy.


564
00:26:53.847 --> 00:26:55.447
How would you like it if
I had a key to your house


565
00:26:55.449 --> 00:26:57.516
And let myself in
whenever I felt like it?


566
00:27:00.295 --> 00:27:02.604
Ok, ella, I'm sorry.

567
00:27:02.606 --> 00:27:04.789
I just wanted to make it
nice for you and lucy,


568
00:27:04.791 --> 00:27:07.642
But you're right.

569
00:27:07.644 --> 00:27:09.110
I should have asked you first.

570
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:15.992
It's just... you know,
it's our new home, and we need


571
00:27:15.994 --> 00:27:17.902
To feel ownership of that.

572
00:27:17.904 --> 00:27:21.556
We need to know that nobody
comes in without our say-so.


573
00:27:21.558 --> 00:27:24.142
Of course.

574
00:27:24.144 --> 00:27:27.479
I can change it back,
take the new stuff away.


575
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:28.613
No, thanks.

576
00:27:28.615 --> 00:27:29.814
I'm heading home.

577
00:27:29.816 --> 00:27:32.266
It's been a long day.

578
00:27:45.966 --> 00:27:46.998
Hey, girls.

579
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.166
How was your day?

580
00:27:48.168 --> 00:27:49.183
Great.

581
00:27:49.185 --> 00:27:50.259
Thanks, roxanne.

582
00:27:50.261 --> 00:27:51.853
Yeah, we had fun, mom.
- Good.


583
00:27:51.855 --> 00:27:53.429
I'm glad you had a good time.
- How was your day?


584
00:27:53.431 --> 00:27:55.673
- All right?
- Productive.


585
00:27:55.675 --> 00:28:01.104
Good, good, good.

586
00:28:02.516 --> 00:28:04.866
What the hell
is that, macie robinson?


587
00:28:04.868 --> 00:28:08.369
- What?
- That thing in your nose.


588
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:09.871
It's called a nose stud, mom.

589
00:28:09.873 --> 00:28:12.040
Me and macie got
matching ones today.


590
00:28:12.042 --> 00:28:13.825
They're really cute,
don't you think?


591
00:28:16.271 --> 00:28:18.346
You got your nose pierced?

592
00:28:18.348 --> 00:28:20.348
Well, yeah, it's not stick-on.

593
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:21.666
I'm not 12.

594
00:28:21.668 --> 00:28:24.052
I didn't say that you
could get that done, macie.


595
00:28:24.054 --> 00:28:25.587
And I didn't ask.

596
00:28:27.782 --> 00:28:28.857
Did you know about this?

597
00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:30.708
Just found out.

598
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.286
What the hell were
you thinking, macie?


599
00:28:33.288 --> 00:28:34.930
I was thinking I looked pretty.

600
00:28:34.932 --> 00:28:36.281
It can get infected!

601
00:28:36.283 --> 00:28:38.057
It can leave a
scar on your face!


602
00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:39.734
Well, luckily,
it's a stud, right?


603
00:28:39.736 --> 00:28:43.038
Because if you took it out now,
it would heal, right, macie?


604
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.056
It is a permanent
hole right in the middle


605
00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:46.708
Of your face, macie.

606
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.301
Well, at least we didn't
get matching sleeve tattoos.


607
00:28:48.303 --> 00:28:49.577
Well, not yet.

608
00:28:49.579 --> 00:28:51.304
I am not a child anymore, mom.

609
00:28:51.306 --> 00:28:53.414
I don't have to ask
you for your permission


610
00:28:53.416 --> 00:28:55.575
For every single little thing.

611
00:29:07.664 --> 00:29:11.566
Don't take it out on me, ok?

612
00:29:11.568 --> 00:29:13.735
It'll heal over once
she gets bored with it.


613
00:29:13.737 --> 00:29:15.269
I really hope that
lucy is not going


614
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:17.605
To be a bad influence on her.

615
00:29:17.607 --> 00:29:19.265
Look, I have faith
in our daughter.


616
00:29:19.267 --> 00:29:22.777
Maybe she's the good
influence that lucy needs.


617
00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:24.520
I shouldn't have
decorated the house


618
00:29:24.522 --> 00:29:26.748
Without ella's permission.

619
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.174
I mean, I just thought that they

620
00:29:28.176 --> 00:29:30.118
Would be happy
and recognize that it


621
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.403
Was a thoughtful gesture.

622
00:29:31.405 --> 00:29:33.955
It was thoughtful, honey.

623
00:29:35.533 --> 00:29:38.184
I just...
I feel bad.


624
00:29:38.186 --> 00:29:40.795
Hey, why don't you invite them

625
00:29:40.797 --> 00:29:44.140
To the lunch tomorrow
right before our first


626
00:29:44.142 --> 00:29:45.533
Counseling session?

627
00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:49.437
Help them feel that they're
a part of the neighborhood.


628
00:29:49.439 --> 00:29:50.622
Yeah.

629
00:29:50.624 --> 00:29:52.381
That's a good idea.

630
00:29:52.383 --> 00:29:56.719
Thanks, honey.

631
00:29:56.721 --> 00:29:58.630
It's going to be fine.

632
00:29:58.632 --> 00:30:00.181
Yeah.

633
00:30:03.578 --> 00:30:04.852
Come on, mom.

634
00:30:04.854 --> 00:30:06.304
It did look a
little bare before.


635
00:30:06.306 --> 00:30:07.439
At least we have some
cushions for the couch.


636
00:30:07.441 --> 00:30:08.823
That's not the point.

637
00:30:08.825 --> 00:30:10.625
And all this fancy
stuff was free.


638
00:30:10.627 --> 00:30:12.385
It's not just
what roxanne's done


639
00:30:12.387 --> 00:30:13.945
In here that's the problem.

640
00:30:13.947 --> 00:30:17.132
Roxanne has advertised her
makeover on social media.


641
00:30:22.489 --> 00:30:25.306
That's not good.

642
00:30:25.308 --> 00:30:27.492
This was supposed to
be a new start for us...


643
00:30:27.494 --> 00:30:29.735
Safe, quiet, under the radar.

644
00:30:29.737 --> 00:30:33.581
And now our home is online,
where anyone could see it.


645
00:30:33.583 --> 00:30:36.151
So what are we going to do?

646
00:30:36.153 --> 00:30:38.744
Change the locks for a start.

647
00:30:38.746 --> 00:30:40.246
I'm not taking any chances.

648
00:30:40.248 --> 00:30:43.324
I know roxanne means well,
but if he finds us,


649
00:30:43.326 --> 00:30:46.344
Then they're in danger too.

650
00:30:56.873 --> 00:30:58.956
You don't think it's
weird that we have strangers


651
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:01.475
Living in our backyard?

652
00:31:01.477 --> 00:31:03.544
It's only strange
because it's new.


653
00:31:03.546 --> 00:31:06.347
This program is going
to change lives.


654
00:31:06.349 --> 00:31:08.850
You'll see.

655
00:31:14.207 --> 00:31:16.207
Come to bed, honey.

656
00:31:36.563 --> 00:31:38.830
Good morning.

657
00:31:38.832 --> 00:31:40.632
Hi.

658
00:31:40.634 --> 00:31:42.867
Planting some herbs?

659
00:31:42.869 --> 00:31:43.918
Succulents.

660
00:31:46.205 --> 00:31:50.558
Hey, I wanted to invite you and
lucy to a lunch party today.


661
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.060
All the neighbors will be there,

662
00:31:52.062 --> 00:31:53.594
So it'll be a really good chance

663
00:31:53.596 --> 00:31:56.422
For you to meet everyone
and introduce yourselves.


664
00:31:56.424 --> 00:31:57.923
Yeah, I don't know.

665
00:31:57.925 --> 00:32:00.159
Come on.
It'll be fun.


666
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:03.054
And you're part of
the neighborhood now.


667
00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:04.172
Ok.

668
00:32:04.174 --> 00:32:05.556
Thanks, roxanne.

669
00:32:05.558 --> 00:32:06.758
Mark will be there, too,
so I was


670
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.276
Thinking that we
could follow it up


671
00:32:08.278 --> 00:32:09.752
With the first
counseling session.


672
00:32:09.754 --> 00:32:11.279
Already?

673
00:32:11.281 --> 00:32:13.606
Well, it'll be good just
to get it out of the way.


674
00:32:16.027 --> 00:32:18.269
See you later?

675
00:32:18.271 --> 00:32:19.345
Sure.

676
00:32:19.347 --> 00:32:20.371
Ok.

677
00:32:20.373 --> 00:32:22.590
Great.

678
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.045
Are you sure you're
going to need all of this?


679
00:32:36.047 --> 00:32:37.505
Well, I just want
it to go really well.


680
00:32:37.507 --> 00:32:40.299
I want ella and lucy
to feel really welcome.


681
00:32:40.301 --> 00:32:42.484
You know, they're not going
to want a big fuss, mom.


682
00:32:42.486 --> 00:32:45.905
I'm not making a big fuss.

683
00:32:45.907 --> 00:32:49.576
By the way, I tried to tag
ella in pictures of the house


684
00:32:49.578 --> 00:32:51.953
Online, and I couldn't
find anything about her


685
00:32:51.955 --> 00:32:53.045
Or lucy on social media.

686
00:32:53.047 --> 00:32:54.439
Like, nothing at all.

687
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:56.824
Not everyone wants to
share their whole lives


688
00:32:56.826 --> 00:32:58.643
On social media.

689
00:32:58.645 --> 00:33:00.278
Yeah, but most people share when

690
00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.562
They move into a new house.

691
00:33:01.564 --> 00:33:02.781
It's a big deal.

692
00:33:02.783 --> 00:33:06.725
No, mom, it's actually
very, very small.


693
00:33:06.727 --> 00:33:08.502
Ha-ha, very funny.

694
00:33:20.466 --> 00:33:21.916
Hey, honey.

695
00:33:21.918 --> 00:33:25.503
No. No, there's something
I need to finish here first.


696
00:33:25.505 --> 00:33:26.629
Yes.

697
00:33:26.631 --> 00:33:28.289
Yes, I'll be home for lunch.

698
00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:29.908
I promise.
Look, I got to go.


699
00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.269
I'm really busy.
All right, bye.


700
00:33:37.533 --> 00:33:39.275
Hello?

701
00:33:39.277 --> 00:33:40.776
yes.

702
00:33:40.778 --> 00:33:42.103
I'm working on this now.

703
00:33:42.105 --> 00:33:43.929
I'm just authorizing the ids,
and the houses


704
00:33:43.931 --> 00:33:45.289
Will be available soon.

705
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:47.516
Short-terms, as we agreed.

706
00:33:47.518 --> 00:33:50.220
No, we are over the limit.

707
00:33:50.222 --> 00:33:54.456
And I can't work
any faster than this, ok?


708
00:33:54.458 --> 00:33:57.635
There are protocols.

709
00:33:57.637 --> 00:34:00.021
Hello?

710
00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.859
What if he's found
out where we are?


711
00:34:05.861 --> 00:34:08.162
What if he saw the
stuff on social media?


712
00:34:08.164 --> 00:34:09.663
He can't have.

713
00:34:09.665 --> 00:34:11.516
We haven't been here long
enough for anyone to know.


714
00:34:11.518 --> 00:34:13.201
I promise.

715
00:34:13.203 --> 00:34:14.735
You promised before.

716
00:34:15.872 --> 00:34:17.372
That was different.

717
00:34:17.374 --> 00:34:19.465
Nobody is ever going
to tell us what to do


718
00:34:19.467 --> 00:34:22.377
Or how to live again.

719
00:34:33.497 --> 00:34:35.874
I'm not sure I would
want that in my backyard.


720
00:34:35.876 --> 00:34:38.484
I mean,
it's a nice little freebie.


721
00:34:38.486 --> 00:34:41.045
You could eventually
turn it into a guest house


722
00:34:41.047 --> 00:34:43.523
Or a home office,
maybe somewhere


723
00:34:43.525 --> 00:34:45.099
For your staff to live.

724
00:34:45.101 --> 00:34:47.435
Perhaps you should consider
getting one too, georgia.


725
00:34:47.437 --> 00:34:49.554
Well, I don't doubt that it
would be a great investment


726
00:34:49.556 --> 00:34:51.072
In the long-term.

727
00:34:51.074 --> 00:34:52.757
But in the short-term,
you would have to host.


728
00:34:52.759 --> 00:34:54.242
Imagine that.

729
00:34:54.244 --> 00:34:56.244
You could literally have
anyone living on your doorstep.


730
00:34:56.246 --> 00:34:57.686
I think it's a great idea.

731
00:34:57.688 --> 00:34:59.096
At least this way
you can guarantee


732
00:34:59.098 --> 00:35:01.690
There will be at least
two interesting people


733
00:35:01.692 --> 00:35:03.117
In the neighborhood.

734
00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:05.344
Well, I suppose it
depends on your definition


735
00:35:05.346 --> 00:35:06.862
Of interesting.

736
00:35:06.864 --> 00:35:09.957
How about someone that's
not obsessed with property


737
00:35:09.959 --> 00:35:11.926
Values and botox?

738
00:35:11.928 --> 00:35:14.429
Well, I wouldn't depend
on your new neighbors


739
00:35:14.431 --> 00:35:16.297
For any grand floristry orders.

740
00:35:16.299 --> 00:35:18.783
I'd be surprised if they could
even afford a potted plant.


741
00:35:20.711 --> 00:35:24.622
Look, roxanne may enjoy playing
lady bountiful to the needy.


742
00:35:24.624 --> 00:35:27.124
I just don't understand
why the rest of us


743
00:35:27.126 --> 00:35:28.292
Have to be dragged along.

744
00:35:30.721 --> 00:35:32.630
Did you hear what
they said about us?


745
00:35:32.632 --> 00:35:33.613
Yeah.

746
00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:35.783
Seems money can't buy manners.

747
00:35:35.785 --> 00:35:37.452
It's not a pledge, georgia.

748
00:35:37.454 --> 00:35:39.120
It's lunch.

749
00:35:39.122 --> 00:35:42.064
I happen to know for a fact
that roxanne didn't want them


750
00:35:42.066 --> 00:35:43.716
Here yet, especially not with it

751
00:35:43.718 --> 00:35:46.827
Being the last summer before
macie goes off to college.


752
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:49.738
She must have felt
pity for them.


753
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.667
Good for her,
but rather her than me.


754
00:35:53.669 --> 00:35:56.137
Well, I'm going to go mingle.

755
00:35:56.139 --> 00:35:57.738
You play nice, ok?

756
00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.065
I always do.

757
00:36:00.067 --> 00:36:01.734
This is all just so gross.

758
00:36:01.736 --> 00:36:02.794
Can we go home?

759
00:36:02.796 --> 00:36:04.570
Because of a woman like that?

760
00:36:04.572 --> 00:36:05.921
Come on.

761
00:36:05.923 --> 00:36:07.423
We'll kill two birds
with one stone.


762
00:36:07.425 --> 00:36:09.634
We'll meet all the neighbors,
idiots included,


763
00:36:09.636 --> 00:36:11.352
And do the counseling session.

764
00:36:11.354 --> 00:36:14.839
That's two more things crossed
off the welcome week list.


765
00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:16.507
It's going to be a long week.

766
00:36:16.509 --> 00:36:19.742
No kidding.

767
00:36:19.762 --> 00:36:22.312
I love the braids, lucy.

768
00:36:22.314 --> 00:36:25.524
Really suits you.

769
00:36:25.526 --> 00:36:26.592
Thanks.

770
00:36:26.594 --> 00:36:28.010
I am so glad you're both here.

771
00:36:28.012 --> 00:36:29.087
Come on.

772
00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:31.005
Let's go meet your neighbors.

773
00:36:32.525 --> 00:36:34.859
I'm good.

774
00:36:37.647 --> 00:36:38.954
Hi.

775
00:36:38.956 --> 00:36:41.699
I'm sasha.
I'm a friend of the family.


776
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:43.050
I'm lucy.

777
00:36:43.052 --> 00:36:44.869
Hi, lucy.

778
00:36:44.871 --> 00:36:47.188
Look, I don't want
you to judge us


779
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.023
By uptight georgia over there.

780
00:36:49.025 --> 00:36:51.759
I, for one, am glad that
you and your mom are here.


781
00:36:51.761 --> 00:36:52.977
Thanks.

782
00:36:52.979 --> 00:36:55.013
So how are you settling in?

783
00:36:55.015 --> 00:36:56.397
It's ok.

784
00:36:56.399 --> 00:36:58.307
I like the house,
and macie's been nice.


785
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:59.273
Macie's great.

786
00:36:59.293 --> 00:37:00.768
Come on.

787
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:03.220
I can show you around and
introduce you to some people?


788
00:37:03.222 --> 00:37:04.203
Come on.

789
00:37:04.223 --> 00:37:06.298
They won't bite.

790
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.483
But I might.

791
00:37:09.162 --> 00:37:11.412
You're feisty.

792
00:37:11.414 --> 00:37:15.583
The dashing hero has arrived.

793
00:37:27.154 --> 00:37:29.738
So I want to welcome you
all to our first


794
00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.165
Counseling session.

795
00:37:31.167 --> 00:37:33.267
This is designed to
help you talk things


796
00:37:33.269 --> 00:37:34.719
Through and work out any

797
00:37:34.721 --> 00:37:38.156
Settling-in issues
you might have, ok?


798
00:37:38.158 --> 00:37:39.991
So this is my talking stick.

799
00:37:39.993 --> 00:37:41.850
The talker holds the stick.

800
00:37:41.852 --> 00:37:43.594
And while they're
talking, the listeners all


801
00:37:43.596 --> 00:37:46.581
Need to let that... the talker
finish without interruptions


802
00:37:46.583 --> 00:37:47.505
Of any kind.

803
00:37:47.525 --> 00:37:48.849
Ok?

804
00:37:48.851 --> 00:37:50.784
It's really designed to
foster mutual respect


805
00:37:50.786 --> 00:37:52.277
And understanding.

806
00:37:52.279 --> 00:37:53.437
All right?

807
00:37:53.439 --> 00:37:54.696
Who'd like to get started?

808
00:37:54.698 --> 00:37:57.691
I would.

809
00:37:57.693 --> 00:38:00.285
Roxanne, I don't
appreciate you posting


810
00:38:00.287 --> 00:38:04.031
Our new home all over social
media without our permission.


811
00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:05.866
We are not your work project.

812
00:38:05.868 --> 00:38:07.752
Our lives are not
your mood board.


813
00:38:11.557 --> 00:38:14.208
I'll go.

814
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:17.612
Ella, we totally understand
your concerns,


815
00:38:17.614 --> 00:38:19.964
Especially when it comes
to your privacy.


816
00:38:19.966 --> 00:38:25.978
And I'm sure that roxanne
will delete all the posts.


817
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.231
We just want you
to feel welcome.


818
00:38:32.803 --> 00:38:33.986
Ok.

819
00:38:33.988 --> 00:38:35.113
Looks like we're
all a little tired.


820
00:38:35.115 --> 00:38:36.572
It's been a long couple of days.

821
00:38:36.574 --> 00:38:38.799
Why don't we continue
this next week?


822
00:38:41.896 --> 00:38:44.539
Roxanne,
can we talk alone, please?


823
00:38:47.234 --> 00:38:48.292
I didn't want to
say this in there


824
00:38:48.294 --> 00:38:49.743
In front of lucy and macie,

825
00:38:49.745 --> 00:38:52.571
But we heard some pretty
horrendous things at that party


826
00:38:52.573 --> 00:38:54.465
Aimed in our direction.

827
00:38:54.467 --> 00:38:56.167
I'm sorry, ella.

828
00:38:56.169 --> 00:39:00.095
Sometimes these people can be
really stuck up and snobby.


829
00:39:00.097 --> 00:39:01.522
Lucy's just a kid.

830
00:39:01.524 --> 00:39:03.007
She doesn't deserve to
be made to feel small.


831
00:39:03.009 --> 00:39:04.842
I know that, ella.

832
00:39:04.844 --> 00:39:08.529
I have a daughter, too, one
who just went behind my back


833
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:11.441
And got a nose piercing because
your daughter suggested it.


834
00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.378
Are you saying my
daughter is a bad influence?


835
00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.404
I'm saying that I
think she can speak


836
00:39:17.406 --> 00:39:19.790
Up for herself just fine.

837
00:39:19.792 --> 00:39:22.593
Seriously, roxanne,
stay out of our lives


838
00:39:22.595 --> 00:39:24.895
If you know what's good for you.

839
00:39:27.608 --> 00:39:30.034
Hi, honey.
- Hi.


840
00:39:30.036 --> 00:39:31.385
Come on, baby.
Let's go.


841
00:39:39.679 --> 00:39:41.879
Well, that went well.

842
00:39:41.881 --> 00:39:44.640
Talk about embarrassing, mom.

843
00:39:44.642 --> 00:39:46.066
Honey, I was just
trying to help.


844
00:39:46.068 --> 00:39:47.901
I didn't expect to be
persecuted for trying


845
00:39:47.903 --> 00:39:49.069
To make them feel welcome.

846
00:39:49.071 --> 00:39:51.238
Maybe it was too early.

847
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.524
You're supposed to start
these things early to iron


848
00:39:53.526 --> 00:39:54.983
Out any potential problems.

849
00:39:54.985 --> 00:39:56.752
The only problem is that you try

850
00:39:56.754 --> 00:39:58.479
And micromanage everyone's lives

851
00:39:58.481 --> 00:40:00.364
Instead of just
leaving them alone.


852
00:40:00.366 --> 00:40:01.640
I do not.

853
00:40:01.642 --> 00:40:04.218
And you can get
a little defensive


854
00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.328
Instead of listening.

855
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:09.207
Macie, that's not fair.

856
00:40:10.502 --> 00:40:12.418
Do I do that?

857
00:40:15.548 --> 00:40:16.529
Ok.

858
00:40:16.549 --> 00:40:17.882
All right.

859
00:40:17.884 --> 00:40:19.050
We just need to take
a break here and talk


860
00:40:19.052 --> 00:40:20.218
About this for a second.

861
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.769
Ok, I need to get back to work.

862
00:40:21.771 --> 00:40:23.178
I need to sign some documents.

863
00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.347
I really could have
done without this today.


864
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:26.255
All right.

865
00:40:26.275 --> 00:40:27.608
I'll see you later.

866
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.761
See you later.

867
00:40:30.763 --> 00:40:32.613
Macie.

868
00:40:32.615 --> 00:40:35.249
I'm going out.

869
00:40:38.588 --> 00:40:41.863
So when is your next gig
that's coming up?


870
00:40:41.865 --> 00:40:44.742
We're working it out.
Probably after this weekend.


871
00:40:44.744 --> 00:40:47.278
Mommy still saying no to you
going to the sun festival?


872
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:51.373
Well, she's not exactly
saying no, but...


873
00:40:51.375 --> 00:40:52.933
You're really missing out.

874
00:40:52.935 --> 00:40:54.376
It's going to be wild.

875
00:40:54.378 --> 00:40:56.220
I would really love to go.

876
00:40:56.222 --> 00:40:59.014
It's our last summer together.

877
00:40:59.016 --> 00:41:00.474
I really wish you could go.

878
00:41:09.235 --> 00:41:11.318
You know what red
roses mean, right?


879
00:41:57.616 --> 00:42:00.284
Hello?

880
00:42:00.286 --> 00:42:02.786
Hello?

881
00:42:13.749 --> 00:42:19.486
Is anybody there?

882
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.401
Hey.

883
00:42:52.421 --> 00:42:53.353
What happened?

884
00:42:55.591 --> 00:42:57.875
What do you think?

885
00:42:57.877 --> 00:43:00.711
Was anything else damaged?

886
00:43:00.713 --> 00:43:01.837
No.

887
00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:03.672
Just this.

888
00:43:03.674 --> 00:43:06.842
Macie must have left
the door unlocked.


889
00:43:06.844 --> 00:43:08.493
Who would do this, mark?

890
00:43:08.495 --> 00:43:09.753
I don't know.

891
00:43:09.755 --> 00:43:11.055
We'll find out.

892
00:43:11.057 --> 00:43:12.848
I mean, that's why we
have security cameras.


893
00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.833
You know, ella was really
angry with me earlier.


894
00:43:14.835 --> 00:43:16.668
She told me to back off or else.

895
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.263
Honey, I know you two

896
00:43:19.265 --> 00:43:20.748
Are tense
with each other right now,


897
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.900
But you can't accuse
someone with no proof.


898
00:43:22.902 --> 00:43:25.452
Well, who else would do this?

899
00:43:25.454 --> 00:43:27.012
I don't know.

900
00:43:27.014 --> 00:43:29.122
I'll figure it out.
Ok?


901
00:43:30.118 --> 00:43:31.425
Are you going to tell macie?

902
00:43:31.427 --> 00:43:32.408
No.

903
00:43:32.428 --> 00:43:34.127
No, I don't want to worry her.

904
00:43:50.796 --> 00:43:52.220
Where were you?

905
00:43:52.222 --> 00:43:53.464
Library.

906
00:43:53.466 --> 00:43:54.664
You know you left
the door unlocked.


907
00:43:54.666 --> 00:43:56.149
Sorry.

908
00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:57.901
Just because you live in a
nice neighborhood doesn't mean


909
00:43:57.903 --> 00:43:59.227
You can be careless, macie.

910
00:43:59.229 --> 00:44:00.545
I said I'm sorry, ok?

911
00:44:00.547 --> 00:44:03.231
People slip in under
the radar even here.


912
00:44:03.233 --> 00:44:05.191
I'll make sure I lock the door.

913
00:44:05.193 --> 00:44:06.125
This came for ella.

914
00:44:06.145 --> 00:44:08.236
It was delivered by mistake.

915
00:44:08.238 --> 00:44:10.555
Goodbye.

916
00:44:10.557 --> 00:44:13.325
I'll take it to her.

917
00:44:32.263 --> 00:44:36.598
Are you checking that we're
recycling correctly now?


918
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.749
No, this just fell out.

919
00:44:37.751 --> 00:44:40.861
I was just putting it back.

920
00:44:40.863 --> 00:44:43.688
It was just such a
bright shade of red,


921
00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:45.432
I wanted to check the color.

922
00:44:45.434 --> 00:44:47.759
Atomic red.

923
00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:49.779
An interesting choice.

924
00:44:51.023 --> 00:44:52.189
Here.

925
00:44:52.191 --> 00:44:54.024
This came to our
house by mistake.


926
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:58.060
Thanks.

927
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.777
So how's the hosting going?

928
00:45:13.779 --> 00:45:16.280
Not as much fun as
I thought it would be.


929
00:45:16.282 --> 00:45:17.706
How come?

930
00:45:17.708 --> 00:45:20.475
I mean, I've tried everything
to connect with ella,


931
00:45:20.477 --> 00:45:22.636
But she just keeps
putting up a wall.


932
00:45:22.638 --> 00:45:23.610
Hey, mom.

933
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:24.721
I'm heading out.

934
00:45:24.723 --> 00:45:25.704
Hi, sasha.

935
00:45:25.724 --> 00:45:27.240
Hi, macie.

936
00:45:27.242 --> 00:45:28.575
Off somewhere fun?

937
00:45:28.577 --> 00:45:30.135
I'm caddying
for my dad this morning.


938
00:45:30.137 --> 00:45:32.579
He's paying me, and I get lunch.

939
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:33.997
Attagirl.

940
00:45:33.999 --> 00:45:35.732
I'll see you at the clubhouse
later for lunch, honey.


941
00:45:35.734 --> 00:45:37.384
Later.
I'll see you.


942
00:45:37.386 --> 00:45:38.418
Bye.

943
00:45:42.975 --> 00:45:45.008
I'm glad we get to
spend the day together, dad,


944
00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.244
Even if it revolves around golf.

945
00:45:47.246 --> 00:45:48.670
Yeah, me too.

946
00:45:48.672 --> 00:45:50.747
You know, you spend
so much time with your mom,


947
00:45:50.749 --> 00:45:52.249
I need my time too.

948
00:45:52.251 --> 00:45:54.151
Well, I just know
you're spread pretty thin


949
00:45:54.153 --> 00:45:56.161
Between the house charity
and your work,


950
00:45:56.163 --> 00:45:58.496
So I appreciate it.

951
00:45:58.498 --> 00:46:00.165
Did your mom drop you off?

952
00:46:00.167 --> 00:46:03.184
Because she's coming back here
after we're finished for lunch.


953
00:46:03.186 --> 00:46:05.353
No, actually.

954
00:46:05.355 --> 00:46:07.447
Ryan gave me a lift.

955
00:46:07.449 --> 00:46:08.414
Ryan?

956
00:46:08.434 --> 00:46:09.415
Who's ryan?

957
00:46:09.435 --> 00:46:11.235
He's my boyfriend.

958
00:46:11.237 --> 00:46:13.178
Boyfriend?

959
00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.679
Do you know him from school?

960
00:46:14.681 --> 00:46:15.839
Kind of.

961
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:16.857
He's working now.

962
00:46:16.859 --> 00:46:18.542
Working?
Great.


963
00:46:18.544 --> 00:46:19.793
What kind of work is he doing?

964
00:46:19.795 --> 00:46:21.612
He's a musician.

965
00:46:21.614 --> 00:46:23.263
He plays guitar in a band.

966
00:46:23.265 --> 00:46:24.415
Wow.

967
00:46:24.417 --> 00:46:26.374
Ok, that sounds like
a solid career choice.


968
00:46:26.376 --> 00:46:28.252
Dad, not every 20-year-old
knows what they want to do


969
00:46:28.254 --> 00:46:30.195
For the rest of their lives.

970
00:46:30.197 --> 00:46:33.114
20, huh?

971
00:46:33.116 --> 00:46:35.759
Look, I don't want to go
all protective dad on you,


972
00:46:35.761 --> 00:46:38.278
But I want you to be careful.

973
00:46:39.515 --> 00:46:41.015
I'm not having this
conversation with you.


974
00:46:41.017 --> 00:46:42.366
Nope.

975
00:46:42.368 --> 00:46:45.119
Ok, you're still
going to law school.


976
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:47.154
Right?

977
00:46:47.156 --> 00:46:48.606
Look, I just...

978
00:46:48.608 --> 00:46:50.899
Sometimes I get
worried about college.


979
00:46:50.901 --> 00:46:53.493
It feels so far away and...

980
00:46:53.495 --> 00:46:54.778
I don't know.

981
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.448
Look, I know it's scary
going away from home,


982
00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.067
But you're going to love it.

983
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:02.161
You're going to have
the time of your life.


984
00:47:02.163 --> 00:47:03.102
Trust me.

985
00:47:03.122 --> 00:47:04.562
It's not just that.

986
00:47:04.564 --> 00:47:08.909
I just don't think it's
really what I want to do.


987
00:47:08.911 --> 00:47:11.352
Finally caught up with you.

988
00:47:11.354 --> 00:47:12.630
What are you doing here?

989
00:47:12.632 --> 00:47:14.114
I didn't know you were a member.

990
00:47:14.116 --> 00:47:15.816
Well, if I can't
get you at the office,


991
00:47:15.818 --> 00:47:18.093
I've got to track you
down at the golf club.


992
00:47:18.095 --> 00:47:21.096
You're always so busy;
what choice do you give me?


993
00:47:21.098 --> 00:47:23.340
- And who is this?
- This is my daughter, Macie.


994
00:47:23.342 --> 00:47:25.041
Macie, this is john.

995
00:47:25.043 --> 00:47:27.511
He's a client of mine,
or should I say coworker now?


996
00:47:27.513 --> 00:47:29.029
Yeah.

997
00:47:29.031 --> 00:47:31.148
Macie's making some extra
cash caddying for me today.


998
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.108
You're going to need that money.

999
00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:34.868
College is expensive.

1000
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:36.444
It's very expensive.

1001
00:47:36.446 --> 00:47:38.113
Why don't you caddy
for me while I


1002
00:47:38.115 --> 00:47:40.023
Play around with your dad
here, and I'll tip you too?


1003
00:47:40.025 --> 00:47:41.175
Ok.

1004
00:47:41.177 --> 00:47:42.326
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.


1005
00:47:42.328 --> 00:47:43.510
That's not necessary.

1006
00:47:43.512 --> 00:47:44.678
A deal's a deal.

1007
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.347
- Shall we go?
- Yeah, let's go.


1008
00:48:06.202 --> 00:48:07.107
Hey.

1009
00:48:07.127 --> 00:48:08.626
Beautiful day.

1010
00:48:08.628 --> 00:48:10.037
Hi.
Yes.


1011
00:48:10.039 --> 00:48:11.555
It's going to be hot.

1012
00:48:11.557 --> 00:48:12.856
Yeah.

1013
00:48:12.858 --> 00:48:14.708
Going out?

1014
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:18.153
Yeah, just to the golf club.

1015
00:48:18.155 --> 00:48:19.213
Not taking your clubs?

1016
00:48:19.215 --> 00:48:20.647
No.

1017
00:48:20.649 --> 00:48:23.491
No, I'm just meeting mark and
macie at the club for lunch.


1018
00:48:23.493 --> 00:48:26.403
And mark's the golfer
in the family.


1019
00:48:26.405 --> 00:48:28.313
Do you or lucy play?

1020
00:48:28.315 --> 00:48:30.040
No, it's not our thing.

1021
00:48:33.671 --> 00:48:37.881
By the way, I snapped
a really cute picture of lucy


1022
00:48:37.883 --> 00:48:40.008
And macie
the other day in the garden,


1023
00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:41.969
And I was going to
tag you on social media,


1024
00:48:41.971 --> 00:48:43.387
But I couldn't find you.

1025
00:48:43.389 --> 00:48:46.773
We don't do social media,
like, at all.


1026
00:48:46.775 --> 00:48:47.908
Ok.

1027
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.910
And as I've said,
I would appreciate you


1028
00:48:49.912 --> 00:48:51.127
Keeping us off yours.

1029
00:49:05.519 --> 00:49:07.494
Hi, roxanne.

1030
00:49:07.496 --> 00:49:09.245
Hi.

1031
00:49:09.247 --> 00:49:10.396
Hey, honey.

1032
00:49:10.398 --> 00:49:12.449
Hey.

1033
00:49:12.451 --> 00:49:14.001
Who was that?
- Who?


1034
00:49:14.003 --> 00:49:15.252
That man.

1035
00:49:15.254 --> 00:49:16.787
He knew my name,
but I didn't know him.


1036
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:17.770
Sure you do.

1037
00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:19.047
That's john carter.

1038
00:49:19.049 --> 00:49:20.457
He's a client of mine.

1039
00:49:20.459 --> 00:49:22.550
You met him at the
firm's christmas party.


1040
00:49:22.552 --> 00:49:23.627
I don't remember.

1041
00:49:23.629 --> 00:49:25.370
There were so many people there.

1042
00:49:25.372 --> 00:49:26.597
I just caddied for him.

1043
00:49:26.599 --> 00:49:28.115
He gave me 100 bucks.

1044
00:49:28.117 --> 00:49:30.133
I tried to say no,
but he wouldn't hear it.


1045
00:49:30.135 --> 00:49:31.285
That's impressive.

1046
00:49:31.287 --> 00:49:32.786
You must have done a good job.

1047
00:49:32.788 --> 00:49:35.272
She did an amazing job.

1048
00:49:35.274 --> 00:49:37.398
We really enjoyed our day today.

1049
00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.809
Let's grab some lunch.
I'm starving.


1050
00:49:38.811 --> 00:49:39.926
Sounds good.
- Let's go.


1051
00:50:19.818 --> 00:50:22.485
Hello?

1052
00:50:22.487 --> 00:50:25.121
Is anybody here?

1053
00:50:39.188 --> 00:50:40.871
Hello?

1054
00:50:40.873 --> 00:50:42.372
Roxanne?

1055
00:50:42.374 --> 00:50:45.676
Macie?

1056
00:51:27.827 --> 00:51:31.421
That was so much fun.

1057
00:51:39.314 --> 00:51:41.356
Dad had me running
to get this one ball,


1058
00:51:41.358 --> 00:51:42.615
And it was all the way out.

1059
00:51:42.617 --> 00:51:43.783
Ok, ok.
- So far.


1060
00:51:43.785 --> 00:51:44.902
I ran like a mile...

1061
00:51:44.904 --> 00:51:45.936
We don't need to bring that up.

1062
00:51:45.938 --> 00:51:47.954
...To go get it.

1063
00:51:50.592 --> 00:51:52.551
Lucy, what are you doing here?

1064
00:51:52.553 --> 00:51:55.579
I saw the back door was
open, so I came in to see


1065
00:51:55.581 --> 00:51:57.331
If everything was all right.

1066
00:51:57.333 --> 00:52:00.024
Macie, I thought I told
you to lock the back door.


1067
00:52:00.026 --> 00:52:01.376
It wasn't me.

1068
00:52:01.378 --> 00:52:02.877
Mom was the last one
to leave the house.


1069
00:52:02.879 --> 00:52:04.137
The door was locked, mark.

1070
00:52:04.139 --> 00:52:05.120
Are you sure?

1071
00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.440
Yes, I'm sure.

1072
00:52:06.442 --> 00:52:08.375
I thought I saw
a man in the backyard,


1073
00:52:08.377 --> 00:52:10.710
But there was nobody
here in the house.


1074
00:52:10.712 --> 00:52:11.886
A man?

1075
00:52:11.888 --> 00:52:14.163
All right.
Thanks for checking in, lucy.


1076
00:52:14.165 --> 00:52:15.432
I appreciate it.

1077
00:52:15.434 --> 00:52:17.809
That's what good
neighbors do, right?


1078
00:52:17.811 --> 00:52:20.086
I'll see you guys later.

1079
00:52:21.999 --> 00:52:25.233
And would it be too
much trouble that everyone


1080
00:52:25.235 --> 00:52:27.385
Please lock the damn door?

1081
00:52:27.387 --> 00:52:29.237
I locked the door, mark.
- Yeah.


1082
00:52:29.239 --> 00:52:30.781
Ok.
I've got to work.


1083
00:52:39.733 --> 00:52:43.493
My heart necklace.

1084
00:52:43.495 --> 00:52:44.711
I'm loving this.

1085
00:52:44.713 --> 00:52:46.079
Yeah, it's my favorite kind.

1086
00:52:46.081 --> 00:52:47.497
It's so much better than coffee.

1087
00:52:47.499 --> 00:52:49.090
Macie, honey,
can you go to your room?


1088
00:52:49.092 --> 00:52:51.167
I need to have
a word with your dad.


1089
00:52:51.169 --> 00:52:52.302
Why?

1090
00:52:52.304 --> 00:52:54.838
Just give us
a minute, honey, please.


1091
00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.974
Ok.

1092
00:52:59.036 --> 00:53:00.677
What's this about?

1093
00:53:00.679 --> 00:53:03.196
My heart necklace is missing
and a lot of my other jewelry.


1094
00:53:03.198 --> 00:53:06.107
What?

1095
00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:07.090
Are you sure?

1096
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.284
Yes, I'm sure.

1097
00:53:08.286 --> 00:53:09.569
And lucy was in our house.

1098
00:53:09.571 --> 00:53:11.779
Ok, lucy said
the back door was open,


1099
00:53:11.781 --> 00:53:13.431
And we found her in the kitchen.

1100
00:53:13.433 --> 00:53:15.692
There's no reason to believe
that she went into our bedroom


1101
00:53:15.694 --> 00:53:17.285
To look around.

1102
00:53:17.287 --> 00:53:19.712
Kind of convenient that
she saw some mystery man.


1103
00:53:19.714 --> 00:53:21.105
Ok, where are you
going with this?


1104
00:53:21.107 --> 00:53:22.940
I think she took
the jewelry, mark.


1105
00:53:22.942 --> 00:53:24.625
I think she took it.

1106
00:53:24.627 --> 00:53:26.686
I think she's going to pawn
it and use it to try to tempt


1107
00:53:26.688 --> 00:53:28.005
Macie into more bodily harm.

1108
00:53:28.007 --> 00:53:30.131
Ok, I thought we were
over the nose stud.


1109
00:53:30.133 --> 00:53:31.724
I don't trust them, mark.

1110
00:53:31.726 --> 00:53:34.302
Ok, do you actually
believe that lucy


1111
00:53:34.304 --> 00:53:35.512
Would steal from you?

1112
00:53:35.514 --> 00:53:37.514
Honey, all of this
stuff has started


1113
00:53:37.516 --> 00:53:39.624
Happening since they moved in.

1114
00:53:39.626 --> 00:53:42.352
We have no idea who they
are, and they literally


1115
00:53:42.354 --> 00:53:43.570
Live in our backyard.

1116
00:53:43.572 --> 00:53:45.188
Ok.

1117
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:47.465
I'll call the police,
but we're going


1118
00:53:47.467 --> 00:53:50.193
To leave it in their hands.

1119
00:53:50.195 --> 00:53:51.803
Ok, we have insurance.

1120
00:53:51.805 --> 00:53:53.547
Ok, worst-case scenario,
I'll buy you another necklace.


1121
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:54.990
That's not the point, mark.

1122
00:53:54.992 --> 00:53:58.585
I'm not going to stand by
while they invade our lives.


1123
00:54:08.321 --> 00:54:09.762
Let me get this clear.

1124
00:54:09.764 --> 00:54:13.083
Are you accusing my
daughter of being a thief?


1125
00:54:13.085 --> 00:54:16.511
I'm asking you to talk to her.

1126
00:54:16.513 --> 00:54:18.996
Lucy was making sure
that everything was ok.


1127
00:54:18.998 --> 00:54:22.242
She was doing you a favor, and
this is the thanks she gets?


1128
00:54:22.244 --> 00:54:24.611
I'm sure you can
see how this looks.


1129
00:54:24.613 --> 00:54:28.014
Lucy goes into my house,
my jewelry goes missing.


1130
00:54:28.016 --> 00:54:30.792
I see exactly how this looks.

1131
00:54:30.794 --> 00:54:34.237
If you harass us again
or come in here uninvited,


1132
00:54:34.239 --> 00:54:38.108
I will get an
injunction against you.


1133
00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:40.627
Mark is going to report
this theft to the police.


1134
00:54:40.629 --> 00:54:45.465
Good.
We have our own people to call.


1135
00:54:58.155 --> 00:55:01.198
I shouldn't have gone over
there when I was so upset.


1136
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.101
Well, you accused
her daughter of theft.


1137
00:55:04.103 --> 00:55:06.811
How did you expect her to react?

1138
00:55:06.813 --> 00:55:08.304
I just... I want
them gone, mark.


1139
00:55:08.306 --> 00:55:10.723
It's too stressful
having them here.


1140
00:55:10.725 --> 00:55:12.400
I don't feel safe anymore.

1141
00:55:12.402 --> 00:55:14.068
Ok, I'm head of
the housing board.


1142
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:17.405
How would it look if I
evicted them on suspicion?


1143
00:55:17.407 --> 00:55:19.907
Let's let the police
handle it, ok?


1144
00:55:19.909 --> 00:55:21.718
Ok.
- All right.


1145
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.036
Come to bed.

1146
00:55:23.038 --> 00:55:24.671
You'll feel better after
a good night's sleep.


1147
00:55:49.214 --> 00:55:50.272
Stop denying it!

1148
00:55:50.274 --> 00:55:51.255
It was obviously you!

1149
00:55:51.275 --> 00:55:52.348
No, it wasn't!

1150
00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:53.591
Who else could it have been?

1151
00:55:53.593 --> 00:55:54.942
I don't know.

1152
00:55:54.944 --> 00:55:56.536
I can't believe
you went in my room!


1153
00:55:56.538 --> 00:55:57.896
I didn't!

1154
00:55:57.898 --> 00:55:59.405
I vouched for you
in front of my mom.


1155
00:55:59.407 --> 00:56:01.024
She told me not to trust
you, and she was right!


1156
00:56:01.026 --> 00:56:02.826
I told you, I didn't
go into your room!


1157
00:56:02.828 --> 00:56:04.285
You stole my diary!

1158
00:56:04.287 --> 00:56:06.120
I didn't take your stupid diary!

1159
00:56:06.122 --> 00:56:08.881
I'm so over all of this!

1160
00:56:22.764 --> 00:56:25.890
Hi, macie.

1161
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.238
Shh.

1162
00:56:40.339 --> 00:56:41.448
Macie?

1163
00:56:50.258 --> 00:56:53.125
Macie?

1164
00:56:59.167 --> 00:57:00.508
Honey.

1165
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:02.159
Honey, have you seen
macie this morning?


1166
00:57:02.161 --> 00:57:03.436
No, why?

1167
00:57:03.438 --> 00:57:04.604
Her bed hasn't been slept in,

1168
00:57:04.606 --> 00:57:05.772
And she's not answering
her phone.


1169
00:57:05.774 --> 00:57:08.258
Where is she?

1170
00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:10.126
I don't know.

1171
00:57:10.128 --> 00:57:12.945
But I did hear
something last night.


1172
00:57:12.947 --> 00:57:15.782
It sounded like an argument
between her and lucy.


1173
00:57:15.784 --> 00:57:17.525
And you didn't
think to go outside


1174
00:57:17.527 --> 00:57:18.568
And see what was going on?

1175
00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:20.344
Well, it went quiet,
and I must have


1176
00:57:20.346 --> 00:57:24.274
Fallen back asleep, because
I didn't think anything of it.


1177
00:57:24.276 --> 00:57:26.409
Honey, I have a really
bad feeling about this.


1178
00:57:26.411 --> 00:57:28.961
She wouldn't just leave
without telling us.


1179
00:57:28.963 --> 00:57:30.096
We have to find her.

1180
00:57:30.098 --> 00:57:31.205
We have to find her now.

1181
00:57:31.207 --> 00:57:32.891
Roxanne, stop.

1182
00:57:32.893 --> 00:57:34.450
She wouldn't just
disappear, mark.


1183
00:57:34.452 --> 00:57:36.027
I know.

1184
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:39.972
Look, I don't want
to break macie's trust,


1185
00:57:39.974 --> 00:57:41.775
And I thought she would have
already told you by now,


1186
00:57:41.777 --> 00:57:46.296
But she has a new boyfriend,
and she's probably with him.


1187
00:57:46.298 --> 00:57:47.705
A boyfriend?

1188
00:57:47.707 --> 00:57:49.390
Yeah, she told me
at the golf club.


1189
00:57:49.392 --> 00:57:51.268
Ryan, I think his name is.

1190
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:53.060
She told you she
had a boyfriend,


1191
00:57:53.062 --> 00:57:54.304
But she didn't tell me?

1192
00:57:54.306 --> 00:57:55.988
Yeah, but it
didn't seem serious.


1193
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:57.274
Honey, that doesn't matter.

1194
00:57:57.276 --> 00:57:58.399
We don't know him.

1195
00:57:58.401 --> 00:58:00.234
He could be anybody.

1196
00:58:00.236 --> 00:58:02.328
I trust our daughter.

1197
00:58:03.615 --> 00:58:07.224
Don't you?

1198
00:58:07.226 --> 00:58:10.002
Yes, lucy said macie
was here last night.


1199
00:58:10.004 --> 00:58:11.237
What time?

1200
00:58:11.239 --> 00:58:12.220
I don't know.

1201
00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.406
It was late.

1202
00:58:13.408 --> 00:58:14.574
Mom was in bed,
so we went outside


1203
00:58:14.576 --> 00:58:16.751
So we didn't disturb her.

1204
00:58:16.753 --> 00:58:17.902
Did you argue?

1205
00:58:17.904 --> 00:58:19.996
Yeah, a bit.

1206
00:58:19.998 --> 00:58:21.681
What about?

1207
00:58:21.683 --> 00:58:23.015
Her diary had gone missing.

1208
00:58:23.017 --> 00:58:24.334
She thought I might
have taken it.


1209
00:58:24.336 --> 00:58:25.985
Well, did you?

1210
00:58:25.987 --> 00:58:27.304
Roxanne.

1211
00:58:27.306 --> 00:58:28.405
No.

1212
00:58:28.407 --> 00:58:29.497
I told her I hadn't taken it.

1213
00:58:29.499 --> 00:58:30.681
She didn't believe me.

1214
00:58:30.683 --> 00:58:32.892
That's what we argued about.
Then I came here.


1215
00:58:32.894 --> 00:58:37.004
That was the last
time I saw her.


1216
00:58:37.006 --> 00:58:38.614
Macie didn't come
home last night.


1217
00:58:38.616 --> 00:58:40.533
Her bed's not even
been slept in.


1218
00:58:40.535 --> 00:58:41.626
I've tried all of her friends.

1219
00:58:41.628 --> 00:58:43.278
No one knows where she is.

1220
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:46.280
Look, roxanne, teenagers
have lives and friends


1221
00:58:46.282 --> 00:58:48.173
- We don't know about.
- Not Macie.


1222
00:58:48.193 --> 00:58:49.951
Yes, even macie.

1223
00:58:49.953 --> 00:58:51.803
All teenagers have secrets.

1224
00:58:51.805 --> 00:58:54.438
She probably is hanging out
with one of those friends


1225
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.865
And lost track of time.

1226
00:58:55.867 --> 00:58:57.183
Go home.

1227
00:58:57.185 --> 00:59:01.838
Wait.
She'll come back.


1228
00:59:33.705 --> 00:59:37.555
- So have you seen Macie today?
- Nope.


1229
00:59:37.575 --> 00:59:39.926
Not replying to my texts at all.

1230
00:59:39.928 --> 00:59:41.235
Yeah.

1231
00:59:41.237 --> 00:59:42.845
Her mom's worried,
because she hasn't been home.


1232
00:59:42.847 --> 00:59:44.822
Is that why you're here?

1233
00:59:44.824 --> 00:59:46.733
I have to say,
I was surprised to get


1234
00:59:46.735 --> 00:59:50.494
A message from some chick who's
living with the robinsons.


1235
00:59:50.496 --> 00:59:52.012
Well, I guess I...

1236
00:59:52.014 --> 00:59:55.925
I kind of hoped you were
here for something else.


1237
00:59:55.927 --> 00:59:57.927
It's pretty cool to have
someone around here that's not


1238
00:59:57.929 --> 01:00:00.263
Totally full of themselves.

1239
01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:02.999
You seem real.

1240
01:00:03.001 --> 01:00:05.451
You're macie's boyfriend.

1241
01:00:05.453 --> 01:00:07.678
Don't think I can't
see what this is about.


1242
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.771
You're jealous of macie.

1243
01:00:08.773 --> 01:00:10.281
I've seen you hanging around.

1244
01:00:10.283 --> 01:00:11.849
You want to have
something that's hers.


1245
01:00:11.851 --> 01:00:13.410
No, that's not at all.

1246
01:00:13.412 --> 01:00:16.963
I bet you secretly love
that she's out of the picture.


1247
01:00:16.965 --> 01:00:19.916
Why else would you
have my number saved?


1248
01:00:19.918 --> 01:00:21.801
How did you even get it?

1249
01:00:21.803 --> 01:00:24.087
If you don't know where
macie is, I'm out of here.


1250
01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:26.380
I'm sure macie wouldn't mind.

1251
01:00:26.382 --> 01:00:28.841
Have a nice life, creep.

1252
01:00:30.011 --> 01:00:31.677
<i>I tried calling
all of macie's friends,</i>


1253
01:00:31.679 --> 01:00:33.062
And none of them have seen her.

1254
01:00:33.064 --> 01:00:34.322
I don't know what
else to do, mark.


1255
01:00:34.324 --> 01:00:36.850
Honey, it's only
been a few hours.


1256
01:00:36.852 --> 01:00:38.959
Look what I found in her room.

1257
01:00:38.961 --> 01:00:41.804
Someone has been watching macie.

1258
01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:44.098
What in the hell are these?

1259
01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.400
Do you think it
could have been lucy?


1260
01:00:46.402 --> 01:00:47.551
Roxanne.

1261
01:00:47.553 --> 01:00:49.069
I mean, maybe lucy
took these pictures,


1262
01:00:49.071 --> 01:00:50.396
And she put them in macie's room

1263
01:00:50.398 --> 01:00:52.131
Whenever she was in the house.

1264
01:00:52.133 --> 01:00:53.666
Ok, why would lucy do this?

1265
01:00:53.668 --> 01:00:55.618
Because she's jealous of macie.

1266
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.488
Honey, we have everything
that they don't.


1267
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:02.976
She's jealous of macie going
to college, of where she lives,


1268
01:01:02.978 --> 01:01:05.979
Of everything that she has,
that we have,


1269
01:01:05.981 --> 01:01:07.755
That they don't have.

1270
01:01:07.757 --> 01:01:10.149
I mean, she's even started
looking like macie.


1271
01:01:10.151 --> 01:01:12.802
Ok, or it could be
macie's new boyfriend.


1272
01:01:15.264 --> 01:01:19.073
- Do you know his last name?
- No.


1273
01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:20.143
Macie never said.

1274
01:01:20.145 --> 01:01:21.694
And you didn't think to ask?

1275
01:01:21.696 --> 01:01:22.845
Honey, what are we
going to do here?


1276
01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:24.605
I'm really worried.
- Ok.


1277
01:01:24.607 --> 01:01:26.149
I'll call the police.

1278
01:01:26.151 --> 01:01:27.183
All right?

1279
01:01:27.185 --> 01:01:28.318
Ok.

1280
01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.116
Hey, kid.

1281
01:01:52.118 --> 01:01:54.118
What are you doing?

1282
01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.738
Just disposing
of some green waste.


1283
01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.813
I have a green thumb.

1284
01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:59.182
I help roxanne with the garden.

1285
01:02:01.553 --> 01:02:02.785
What are you up to?

1286
01:02:02.787 --> 01:02:05.054
Just getting some fresh air.

1287
01:02:05.056 --> 01:02:06.814
Did you hear about macie?

1288
01:02:06.816 --> 01:02:08.391
She didn't come home last night.

1289
01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:09.626
I did.

1290
01:02:09.628 --> 01:02:11.611
Do you know anything about that?

1291
01:02:11.613 --> 01:02:12.745
No.

1292
01:02:12.747 --> 01:02:15.131
- Do you?
- No.


1293
01:02:15.133 --> 01:02:18.067
But sounds to me like she
finally found some freedom


1294
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:19.902
And decided to have some fun.

1295
01:02:22.156 --> 01:02:24.256
We all have our little secrets.

1296
01:02:26.244 --> 01:02:29.395
Yeah.

1297
01:02:33.601 --> 01:02:38.529
So how long has it been
since you've seen macie?


1298
01:02:38.531 --> 01:02:40.572
- Yesterday. Yesterday evening.
- Yeah.


1299
01:02:40.592 --> 01:02:42.267
Yeah, yesterday evening.

1300
01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:44.944
And, sir, it is not like our
daughter to stay out all night


1301
01:02:44.946 --> 01:02:46.229
And not let us
know where she is.


1302
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:48.114
All right, well, the
department requires 48 hours


1303
01:02:48.116 --> 01:02:50.249
To have passed before we
can file any sort of missing


1304
01:02:50.251 --> 01:02:52.235
Persons report,
especially in the instance


1305
01:02:52.237 --> 01:02:53.452
That it's not a child.

1306
01:02:53.454 --> 01:02:54.678
Macie is 18, right?

1307
01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.622
Well, yes, but she would
never stay out all night


1308
01:02:56.624 --> 01:02:58.365
And not let us know.

1309
01:02:58.367 --> 01:03:00.243
You'd be surprised at
how often I hear that.


1310
01:03:00.245 --> 01:03:01.511
Well, she left her purse.

1311
01:03:01.513 --> 01:03:03.637
She's not answering her phone.

1312
01:03:03.639 --> 01:03:05.372
Teenagers forget to
call their parents,


1313
01:03:05.374 --> 01:03:07.049
Especially if they think
they're in trouble.


1314
01:03:07.051 --> 01:03:09.193
Ok, officer south,
my husband, he heard


1315
01:03:09.195 --> 01:03:12.105
Lucy arguing with
macie last night.


1316
01:03:12.107 --> 01:03:13.873
The girl in the
little house out back?


1317
01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:15.449
Yes.

1318
01:03:15.451 --> 01:03:18.394
They were the last people to
see macie, her and her mother.


1319
01:03:18.396 --> 01:03:19.545
Ok.

1320
01:03:19.547 --> 01:03:21.055
I'll go ahead and speak to them,

1321
01:03:21.057 --> 01:03:22.706
But it'll just be
a general inquiry.


1322
01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:24.708
There is no reason to put them
under any sort of suspicion.


1323
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:27.103
I know that they're
connected, ok?


1324
01:03:27.105 --> 01:03:28.804
Lucy took macie's diary.

1325
01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.489
That's why they were arguing.

1326
01:03:30.491 --> 01:03:32.491
Mrs. Robinson,
I'm going to have to warn you


1327
01:03:32.493 --> 01:03:34.827
Against making any
unsubstantiated accusations,


1328
01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:36.779
Or you're going to have
more issues than a teenager


1329
01:03:36.781 --> 01:03:38.555
Who stayed out for a night.

1330
01:03:38.557 --> 01:03:41.667
Now, I would advise you to stay
away from lucy and her mother.


1331
01:03:41.669 --> 01:03:43.394
Let me handle this.

1332
01:03:43.396 --> 01:03:44.454
Ok?

1333
01:03:44.456 --> 01:03:47.506
Now, this boyfriend...

1334
01:03:47.508 --> 01:03:48.791
Ryan.

1335
01:03:48.793 --> 01:03:49.976
Last name?

1336
01:03:53.014 --> 01:03:55.732
I don't know.

1337
01:03:55.734 --> 01:03:57.150
That's all you know about him?

1338
01:03:57.152 --> 01:04:00.470
No last name,
no phone number, no address?


1339
01:04:00.472 --> 01:04:03.263
He's a musician.

1340
01:04:03.265 --> 01:04:04.474
Right.

1341
01:04:04.476 --> 01:04:06.993
I don't suppose you
know what band he's in?


1342
01:04:06.995 --> 01:04:08.161
No.

1343
01:04:08.163 --> 01:04:09.829
Do you think this
ryan could have


1344
01:04:09.831 --> 01:04:12.482
Been the one who left the
photos you found in her room?


1345
01:04:12.484 --> 01:04:15.318
Well, I suppose
it's a possibility.


1346
01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.852
Or it could have been lucy.

1347
01:04:19.123 --> 01:04:20.539
Ok.

1348
01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:21.991
I think I have everything
I need for the time being.


1349
01:04:21.993 --> 01:04:24.284
Ok, before you leave,
will you just


1350
01:04:24.286 --> 01:04:26.512
Walk through her room again
one more time


1351
01:04:26.514 --> 01:04:29.123
And just look to see
if I missed anything,


1352
01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:31.033
Maybe a clue or something?

1353
01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:32.443
Sure.

1354
01:04:32.445 --> 01:04:34.111
I'll check it out if it'll
put your mind at rest.


1355
01:04:34.113 --> 01:04:37.023
But in my experience,
teenagers stay out for a night,


1356
01:04:37.025 --> 01:04:39.633
They go out partying,
forget to call home.


1357
01:04:39.635 --> 01:04:42.193
- Not our daughter.
- Yeah.


1358
01:04:42.213 --> 01:04:44.197
Thank you.
- All right.


1359
01:05:02.433 --> 01:05:04.383
Is this the missing diary?

1360
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.904
Yes, but that's not
where she normally kept it.


1361
01:05:10.959 --> 01:05:13.375
It says she was planning
on going to the sun festival


1362
01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:15.995
With her boyfriend, ryan.

1363
01:05:15.997 --> 01:05:18.405
Sounds pretty excited about it.

1364
01:05:18.407 --> 01:05:19.999
Sun festival's
this weekend, right?


1365
01:05:20.001 --> 01:05:22.068
Yes, but I told her
that she couldn't go.


1366
01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:23.769
We already had plans.

1367
01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:25.972
It sounds like your
mystery's solved.


1368
01:05:25.974 --> 01:05:27.264
Ok.

1369
01:05:27.266 --> 01:05:30.259
Sorry to waste
your time, officer.


1370
01:05:30.261 --> 01:05:32.078
But her phone.

1371
01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.597
Probably out of power
or just ignoring you


1372
01:05:34.599 --> 01:05:37.950
So you won't
tell her come back home.


1373
01:05:37.952 --> 01:05:39.093
So what do we do?

1374
01:05:39.095 --> 01:05:40.403
I would just sit tight.

1375
01:05:40.405 --> 01:05:41.937
Wait for her to come back home.

1376
01:05:41.939 --> 01:05:44.240
When this festival is over,
just dock her allowance


1377
01:05:44.242 --> 01:05:46.016
So she doesn't do it again.

1378
01:05:46.018 --> 01:05:49.078
If she doesn't come back, file
a missing persons report then.


1379
01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.871
I wouldn't be too
hard on her, though,


1380
01:05:50.873 --> 01:05:52.448
Or else she'll never tell
you what she's up to.


1381
01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:54.000
Just my two cents.

1382
01:05:56.137 --> 01:05:59.305
Thank you.

1383
01:05:59.307 --> 01:06:01.198
I didn't pay
what I paid for the police


1384
01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.592
To show up at my door.

1385
01:06:02.594 --> 01:06:06.387
You better take care
of this or I will.


1386
01:06:07.723 --> 01:06:08.981
Is everything ok, mom?

1387
01:06:08.983 --> 01:06:11.684
Yes, everything's fine.

1388
01:06:12.771 --> 01:06:13.986
Who was that on the phone?

1389
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:17.607
A damn bill collector.

1390
01:06:19.235 --> 01:06:20.459
Really?

1391
01:06:20.461 --> 01:06:21.426
Yes, really.

1392
01:06:21.446 --> 01:06:22.945
You don't have to
worry about it.


1393
01:06:22.947 --> 01:06:24.496
Everything's fine now.

1394
01:06:24.498 --> 01:06:28.132
- Do you think the police
will be back? - No.


1395
01:06:28.152 --> 01:06:29.243
They won't.

1396
01:06:29.245 --> 01:06:30.561
How can you be so sure?

1397
01:06:30.563 --> 01:06:32.671
Because we told
the police the truth,


1398
01:06:32.673 --> 01:06:35.166
That we don't know anything
about where macie is.


1399
01:06:35.168 --> 01:06:38.352
You haven't seen her since
she left last night, right?


1400
01:06:38.354 --> 01:06:40.296
Right.

1401
01:06:40.298 --> 01:06:42.148
Good.

1402
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:43.599
Then we have nothing
to worry about.


1403
01:06:56.998 --> 01:07:00.699
Honey, what are you doing?

1404
01:07:00.701 --> 01:07:02.926
There are friends
in here I've never


1405
01:07:02.928 --> 01:07:05.554
Even heard of,
parties that she's been to


1406
01:07:05.556 --> 01:07:07.239
That I didn't know about.

1407
01:07:07.241 --> 01:07:10.784
Sweetheart, she's a teenager.

1408
01:07:10.786 --> 01:07:12.511
She's never going to
tell us everything.


1409
01:07:14.332 --> 01:07:16.015
Maybe we don't know our daughter

1410
01:07:16.017 --> 01:07:18.183
As well as we thought we did.

1411
01:07:18.185 --> 01:07:19.234
Maybe.

1412
01:07:19.236 --> 01:07:20.386
That's normal.

1413
01:07:20.388 --> 01:07:23.222
Not for our family.

1414
01:07:23.224 --> 01:07:25.675
Ok.

1415
01:07:25.677 --> 01:07:29.011
Macie deserves her privacy.

1416
01:07:29.013 --> 01:07:30.637
We all do.

1417
01:07:30.639 --> 01:07:33.957
It says in there she
wants to go to art school.


1418
01:07:33.959 --> 01:07:35.734
She doesn't even
want to be a lawyer.


1419
01:07:35.736 --> 01:07:39.705
Ok, look, let's talk about
that when she gets back.


1420
01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:43.242
She'll be home soon,
safe and sound.


1421
01:07:54.338 --> 01:07:56.171
Hello, macie?

1422
01:07:57.917 --> 01:07:58.898
Who is this?

1423
01:07:58.918 --> 01:08:01.610
Give me that.

1424
01:08:01.612 --> 01:08:03.045
Hello?

1425
01:08:04.673 --> 01:08:06.098
They hung up.

1426
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.908
What'd they say?

1427
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:11.587
He said she'll pay
one way or the other.


1428
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:13.672
They must be
talking about macie.


1429
01:08:13.674 --> 01:08:15.766
Mark, what do we do?

1430
01:08:15.768 --> 01:08:19.979
Take that number down
and give it to officer south.


1431
01:08:23.609 --> 01:08:25.151
Ok.

1432
01:08:25.153 --> 01:08:26.319
Hello?

1433
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:44.419
<i>Sorry, your call
cannot be completed.</i>


1434
01:08:51.287 --> 01:08:52.545
Who was it?

1435
01:08:52.547 --> 01:08:54.430
It was just john about work.

1436
01:08:54.432 --> 01:08:56.390
He's just chasing
some paperwork.


1437
01:08:56.392 --> 01:08:57.658
Did you get the number?

1438
01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.434
Yeah, it wasn't
one I recognized.


1439
01:08:59.436 --> 01:09:03.773
I tried to call it,
but it was blocked.


1440
01:09:03.775 --> 01:09:05.124
I got to go to the office.

1441
01:09:05.126 --> 01:09:06.525
Now?

1442
01:09:06.527 --> 01:09:08.902
Yeah, there's some paperwork
that needs to be sorted.


1443
01:09:08.904 --> 01:09:10.070
I won't be long.

1444
01:09:10.072 --> 01:09:11.571
Honey, macie is still missing.

1445
01:09:11.573 --> 01:09:12.949
And that if that guy
calls back again?


1446
01:09:12.951 --> 01:09:14.383
I know.
Listen, I won't be long, ok?


1447
01:09:14.385 --> 01:09:16.410
If they do, just record it, ok?

1448
01:09:19.207 --> 01:09:20.146
Ok.

1449
01:09:20.166 --> 01:09:21.624
I just want her back, mark.

1450
01:09:21.626 --> 01:09:23.342
I do too.

1451
01:09:23.344 --> 01:09:25.235
I do too, ok?

1452
01:09:25.237 --> 01:09:26.245
I won't be long.

1453
01:09:26.247 --> 01:09:29.865
I promise.

1454
01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.187
Where are you, lucy?

1455
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:44.296
Call me back.

1456
01:10:12.343 --> 01:10:15.127
Shh.

1457
01:10:33.155 --> 01:10:38.567
I will take the gag off
if you promise to be quiet.


1458
01:10:38.569 --> 01:10:40.752
Do you understand?

1459
01:10:42.573 --> 01:10:44.573
Do you understand?

1460
01:10:47.061 --> 01:10:48.561
Good.

1461
01:10:55.419 --> 01:10:57.720
Shh.

1462
01:11:13.104 --> 01:11:14.344
Lucy.

1463
01:11:14.346 --> 01:11:16.322
What's going on, macie?

1464
01:11:16.324 --> 01:11:17.573
Who was that man?

1465
01:11:22.663 --> 01:11:23.770
<i>Hi, this is mark robinson.</i>

1466
01:11:23.956 --> 01:11:25.397
<i>Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.</i>


1467
01:11:25.399 --> 01:11:26.915
mark, where are you?

1468
01:11:26.917 --> 01:11:29.268
Call me when you
get this, please.


1469
01:12:18.519 --> 01:12:20.794
What can I do for you, officer?

1470
01:12:20.796 --> 01:12:22.446
I got some information
on your husband.


1471
01:12:22.448 --> 01:12:23.964
He's been in an accident.

1472
01:12:23.966 --> 01:12:26.099
Looks like it could
be a hit-and-run.


1473
01:12:26.101 --> 01:12:27.359
Well, is my husband ok?

1474
01:12:27.361 --> 01:12:29.085
Can I go see him?

1475
01:12:29.087 --> 01:12:30.512
He's stable.

1476
01:12:30.514 --> 01:12:31.522
They're working
on him right now,


1477
01:12:31.524 --> 01:12:32.681
So you won't be able to see him.

1478
01:12:32.683 --> 01:12:34.132
But he's going to be fine.

1479
01:12:34.134 --> 01:12:35.692
Plus, it's best that you
stay here just in case


1480
01:12:35.694 --> 01:12:37.594
Your daughter returns home.

1481
01:12:37.596 --> 01:12:39.037
What happened?

1482
01:12:39.039 --> 01:12:40.506
Not exactly sure.

1483
01:12:40.508 --> 01:12:41.948
It's a very quiet road.

1484
01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:43.099
Not too many witnesses.

1485
01:12:43.101 --> 01:12:44.677
Both doors were
open in the vehicle,


1486
01:12:44.679 --> 01:12:46.453
So there's evidence that
he might have had someone


1487
01:12:46.455 --> 01:12:47.621
With him who fled the scene.

1488
01:12:51.294 --> 01:12:52.868
I called yesterday
with the number


1489
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:54.353
From that threatening message.

1490
01:12:54.355 --> 01:12:56.689
Have you guys had a
chance to trace it yet?


1491
01:12:56.691 --> 01:12:58.006
We're working on it.

1492
01:12:58.008 --> 01:12:59.567
What if it's connected to this?

1493
01:12:59.569 --> 01:13:00.709
I'm going to
check that number as


1494
01:13:00.711 --> 01:13:02.135
Soon as I get to the station.

1495
01:13:02.137 --> 01:13:03.094
I promise.

1496
01:13:03.114 --> 01:13:04.095
Thank you.

1497
01:13:04.115 --> 01:13:06.231
All right.

1498
01:13:08.877 --> 01:13:12.237
Roxanne?

1499
01:13:14.007 --> 01:13:15.307
I saw the police car out front.

1500
01:13:15.309 --> 01:13:16.725
Is there any news?

1501
01:13:16.727 --> 01:13:18.985
Not about macie.

1502
01:13:18.987 --> 01:13:21.547
They were here because
mark's been in an accident.


1503
01:13:21.549 --> 01:13:22.989
They said it was a hit-and-run.

1504
01:13:22.991 --> 01:13:24.307
My god.

1505
01:13:24.309 --> 01:13:25.325
Is he ok?

1506
01:13:25.327 --> 01:13:27.119
Honestly, I don't know.

1507
01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.723
Lucy's gone too.

1508
01:13:30.725 --> 01:13:31.923
She didn't come home last night.

1509
01:13:31.925 --> 01:13:32.857
What?

1510
01:13:32.877 --> 01:13:34.059
She doesn't
know anyone around here


1511
01:13:34.061 --> 01:13:35.168
Except you and macie.

1512
01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:36.545
Ella, this has
got to be connected.


1513
01:13:36.547 --> 01:13:38.881
Both girls are missing and
mark being run off the road?


1514
01:13:38.883 --> 01:13:40.156
I know.

1515
01:13:40.158 --> 01:13:41.767
And last night
we got a threatening phone call


1516
01:13:41.769 --> 01:13:44.936
About macie saying she'll
pay one way or the other.


1517
01:13:44.938 --> 01:13:46.179
What?

1518
01:13:46.181 --> 01:13:47.740
Did you tell the police?

1519
01:13:47.742 --> 01:13:50.092
Yes, but they haven't had a
chance to trace the call yet.


1520
01:13:54.523 --> 01:13:56.523
And honestly, I told them
that I thought that you


1521
01:13:56.525 --> 01:13:59.418
And lucy might be involved.

1522
01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.027
Well, I wasn't.

1523
01:14:01.029 --> 01:14:03.697
But that doesn't mean
that I didn't


1524
01:14:03.699 --> 01:14:07.292
Get you mixed up with somebody
who is really bad news.


1525
01:14:07.294 --> 01:14:09.078
What?

1526
01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.061
Text me the number.

1527
01:14:10.081 --> 01:14:11.296
I'll get it checked out.

1528
01:14:11.298 --> 01:14:13.415
I have people who can trace it.

1529
01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:15.133
Ella, I'm really sorry about...

1530
01:14:15.135 --> 01:14:16.602
There's no time for that now.

1531
01:14:16.604 --> 01:14:19.121
Right now, we need to
get our daughters back.


1532
01:14:19.123 --> 01:14:20.196
I'll drive.

1533
01:14:22.367 --> 01:14:23.475
Hold on.

1534
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.111
Sasha.

1535
01:14:27.131 --> 01:14:28.797
Hey.

1536
01:14:28.799 --> 01:14:30.790
It's ok.
It's going to be ok.


1537
01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:32.309
Is it?

1538
01:14:32.311 --> 01:14:34.894
Because I just found out
that mark was in an accident,


1539
01:14:34.896 --> 01:14:38.774
And I still have no
idea where macie is.


1540
01:14:38.776 --> 01:14:42.385
Because as it turns out,
I have no idea


1541
01:14:42.387 --> 01:14:46.315
What's going on in her life.

1542
01:14:46.317 --> 01:14:47.633
Are you serious?

1543
01:14:47.635 --> 01:14:49.818
Are you that clueless?

1544
01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.303
What?

1545
01:14:55.126 --> 01:14:58.168
Sasha, why are you
wearing my necklace?


1546
01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:00.212
I wouldn't take anything
that wasn't given to me.


1547
01:15:01.966 --> 01:15:04.583
Mark bought me the same one.

1548
01:15:04.585 --> 01:15:08.094
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

1549
01:15:08.096 --> 01:15:11.640
I really wish I could say
that I feel sorry for you,


1550
01:15:11.642 --> 01:15:13.099
But I don't.

1551
01:15:13.101 --> 01:15:15.927
You've lived this perfect life...

1552
01:15:15.929 --> 01:15:21.274
Perfect husband,
perfect house, perfect family.


1553
01:15:21.276 --> 01:15:23.760
But it's all been a lie.

1554
01:15:23.762 --> 01:15:27.280
Now, it seems like
it's not perfect after all.


1555
01:15:27.282 --> 01:15:31.327
And I really hope that
mark can finally see that.


1556
01:15:31.329 --> 01:15:34.120
Get the hell away
from my house, sasha.


1557
01:15:34.122 --> 01:15:37.382
Look, I'm really
sorry about macie.


1558
01:15:37.384 --> 01:15:38.533
I hope you find her.

1559
01:15:38.535 --> 01:15:41.252
I said get the
hell out of my house.


1560
01:15:52.082 --> 01:15:53.640
No name, but I have the address.

1561
01:15:53.642 --> 01:15:55.066
Good.
Let's go.


1562
01:15:55.068 --> 01:15:57.645
What the hell, roxanne?

1563
01:15:57.647 --> 01:15:58.812
Found it in mark's stuff.

1564
01:15:58.814 --> 01:15:59.921
Is it loaded?

1565
01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:01.390
Yeah.

1566
01:16:01.392 --> 01:16:03.742
And there's a few people I
could use it on right now.


1567
01:16:12.686 --> 01:16:14.160
My source is good.

1568
01:16:14.162 --> 01:16:16.755
It should be around
here somewhere.


1569
01:16:16.757 --> 01:16:19.007
How do you know
these kinds of people?


1570
01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:22.711
These kinds of people
helped me and lucy get away.


1571
01:16:22.713 --> 01:16:25.672
We had our reasons for
running and paying a premium


1572
01:16:25.674 --> 01:16:27.549
To get on that housing list.

1573
01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:30.510
Premium?

1574
01:16:30.512 --> 01:16:35.849
My ex-husband,
lucy's dad, he's a man who


1575
01:16:35.851 --> 01:16:37.576
Doesn't know how to let go.

1576
01:16:37.578 --> 01:16:39.928
He's dangerous, and I didn't
want him to find us


1577
01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:41.871
When he got out of prison.

1578
01:16:41.873 --> 01:16:44.090
I need to stay under the radar
for mine and lucy's sake.


1579
01:16:44.092 --> 01:16:45.934
Which is why you don't
have a social media.


1580
01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:51.940
Who did you pay a premium to?

1581
01:17:03.854 --> 01:17:05.361
There's a truck
that's been following us


1582
01:17:05.363 --> 01:17:06.605
For a few miles now.

1583
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:11.217
Put your foot down, roxanne.

1584
01:17:11.219 --> 01:17:12.294
We need to lose him.

1585
01:17:21.822 --> 01:17:22.988
Come on. Faster.

1586
01:17:30.572 --> 01:17:32.330
There's a turn right there.

1587
01:17:48.381 --> 01:17:49.815
Thank goodness.

1588
01:17:49.817 --> 01:17:51.550
Come on.
It should be this way.


1589
01:17:57.666 --> 01:17:59.182
It was your dad.

1590
01:17:59.184 --> 01:18:01.310
I promise.

1591
01:18:01.312 --> 01:18:02.511
What?

1592
01:18:02.513 --> 01:18:04.279
No, I don't believe you.

1593
01:18:04.281 --> 01:18:05.514
Why would I lie?

1594
01:18:05.516 --> 01:18:08.350
I saw his face before he
dragged me into his car.


1595
01:18:08.352 --> 01:18:10.535
Why would my dad kidnap you?

1596
01:18:10.537 --> 01:18:12.095
I don't know.

1597
01:18:12.097 --> 01:18:17.175
And then that pig dragged me
from him and brought me here.


1598
01:18:17.177 --> 01:18:22.547
Come here.

1599
01:18:22.549 --> 01:18:24.016
Hold still.

1600
01:18:26.778 --> 01:18:28.294
Hurry.

1601
01:18:28.296 --> 01:18:29.671
I've been working on
loosening them all morning.


1602
01:18:29.673 --> 01:18:32.541
I'm doing the best I can.

1603
01:18:34.061 --> 01:18:36.778
- There.
- Thank god.


1604
01:18:43.269 --> 01:18:44.553
Come on, come on.

1605
01:18:44.555 --> 01:18:46.646
I can't get them loose.

1606
01:18:46.648 --> 01:18:48.206
You go.
- What?


1607
01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:49.173
No, I can't.

1608
01:18:49.193 --> 01:18:52.443
Don't make me come up there!

1609
01:19:08.962 --> 01:19:10.712
Go.

1610
01:19:10.714 --> 01:19:12.898
I promise I'll
come back for you.


1611
01:19:24.728 --> 01:19:25.926
Ok.

1612
01:19:25.946 --> 01:19:27.062
You go around back.

1613
01:19:27.064 --> 01:19:28.914
See if you can
find a way inside.


1614
01:19:28.916 --> 01:19:30.615
I'm going to go to the front
and see who answers the door.


1615
01:19:30.617 --> 01:19:31.783
We have to make sure
the girls are here


1616
01:19:31.785 --> 01:19:32.834
Before we call the police.

1617
01:19:32.836 --> 01:19:34.611
Ok.

1618
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:37.239
Be careful.

1619
01:20:19.909 --> 01:20:21.365
Roxanne?

1620
01:20:23.746 --> 01:20:25.871
What are you doing here?

1621
01:20:25.873 --> 01:20:27.956
John?

1622
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:41.427
You need to get here quick.

1623
01:20:41.429 --> 01:20:43.429
There's been a kidnapping.

1624
01:20:43.431 --> 01:20:45.690
You were at the golf club.

1625
01:20:47.936 --> 01:20:50.662
I was trying to get
in touch with mark,


1626
01:20:50.664 --> 01:20:54.849
But I couldn't, and he said he
had a meeting with you today.


1627
01:20:54.851 --> 01:20:59.171
And I found this address
with your name on it.


1628
01:20:59.173 --> 01:21:01.657
I have no idea
where your husband is.


1629
01:21:01.659 --> 01:21:04.826
You drove all this
way on your own?


1630
01:21:04.828 --> 01:21:05.952
Yeah.

1631
01:21:05.954 --> 01:21:07.028
Yeah, just me.

1632
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:09.547
I didn't realize
how far this was.


1633
01:21:09.549 --> 01:21:10.514
There's nothing out here.

1634
01:21:10.534 --> 01:21:12.834
Nothing at all.

1635
01:21:12.836 --> 01:21:13.758
No neighbors.

1636
01:21:13.778 --> 01:21:15.336
Nothing.

1637
01:21:15.338 --> 01:21:16.571
That's just the way I like it.

1638
01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:21.359
It's not a place a woman would
want to end up on her own.


1639
01:21:22.879 --> 01:21:26.397
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

1640
01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:31.936
Macie!

1641
01:21:31.938 --> 01:21:34.231
Mom, watch out!

1642
01:21:34.233 --> 01:21:35.356
No!

1643
01:21:35.358 --> 01:21:38.059
Mom, get up!

1644
01:21:42.825 --> 01:21:44.582
Your husband should have paid me

1645
01:21:44.584 --> 01:21:48.036
What he owed me if he wanted
to keep his daughter safe.


1646
01:21:48.038 --> 01:21:49.387
Get up!

1647
01:21:49.389 --> 01:21:51.981
Instead of trying to pay
me off with another girl.


1648
01:21:51.983 --> 01:21:53.816
But then again, your husband was

1649
01:21:53.818 --> 01:21:56.745
Always a double-dealing pig!

1650
01:21:56.747 --> 01:22:02.158
Fortunately, two girls
gives me twice the money.


1651
01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.066
Mom, get up!

1652
01:22:03.086 --> 01:22:05.821
Get up, please!

1653
01:22:05.823 --> 01:22:08.022
I warned you not to test me!

1654
01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:09.407
Leave her alone!

1655
01:22:12.412 --> 01:22:13.778
Stop!

1656
01:22:18.785 --> 01:22:21.986
No!

1657
01:22:21.988 --> 01:22:24.372
Mom, get up!

1658
01:22:24.374 --> 01:22:26.265
Will you shut up?

1659
01:22:26.267 --> 01:22:28.193
Get back inside!

1660
01:22:46.763 --> 01:22:48.262
Get your dirty hands off of her.

1661
01:23:12.155 --> 01:23:13.671
How did you get here so quick?

1662
01:23:13.673 --> 01:23:15.957
We were expecting
miss willis' call.


1663
01:23:15.959 --> 01:23:17.642
We've been watching this place.

1664
01:23:17.644 --> 01:23:20.153
Mr. Carter and his operation
have been on our radar


1665
01:23:20.155 --> 01:23:21.771
For a long time now.

1666
01:23:21.773 --> 01:23:23.932
What's his operation?

1667
01:23:23.934 --> 01:23:25.500
Human trafficking.

1668
01:23:25.502 --> 01:23:28.853
We have information that
he's been moving women


1669
01:23:28.855 --> 01:23:32.090
To a series of safe houses
and over state lines


1670
01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:35.093
Complete with forged
paperwork, making it nearly


1671
01:23:35.095 --> 01:23:37.979
Impossible to track them.

1672
01:23:37.981 --> 01:23:40.782
I'm sorry.

1673
01:23:40.784 --> 01:23:43.835
Honey.
Are you ok?


1674
01:23:43.837 --> 01:23:45.737
Yeah.

1675
01:23:45.739 --> 01:23:47.196
Careful.

1676
01:23:47.198 --> 01:23:48.264
I think you're
going to have to hug me


1677
01:23:48.266 --> 01:23:50.175
With one arm for a while.

1678
01:23:50.177 --> 01:23:52.101
I knew you'd find us.

1679
01:23:52.103 --> 01:23:54.212
You saved us.

1680
01:23:54.214 --> 01:23:57.382
Bet you didn't know your
mom's such a badass, huh?


1681
01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:05.090
Come on.
It's time to go home.


1682
01:24:09.847 --> 01:24:11.045
Stay in the car, macie.

1683
01:24:11.047 --> 01:24:12.138
Mom.

1684
01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:16.901
I said stay here.

1685
01:24:16.903 --> 01:24:18.236
Hey.

1686
01:24:20.849 --> 01:24:22.006
Hey.

1687
01:24:22.008 --> 01:24:24.425
Is macie all right?

1688
01:24:24.427 --> 01:24:25.801
She's safe.

1689
01:24:25.803 --> 01:24:28.579
Thank god.

1690
01:24:28.581 --> 01:24:30.581
Roxanne, this isn't
what it looks like.


1691
01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:33.584
You handed lucy
over to a trafficker.


1692
01:24:33.586 --> 01:24:36.154
Ok, I only did it
to get macie back.


1693
01:24:36.156 --> 01:24:38.223
Carter said he was going to
exchange her for macie,


1694
01:24:38.225 --> 01:24:39.424
All right?

1695
01:24:39.426 --> 01:24:41.500
And then he ran me off the
road and took lucy too.


1696
01:24:41.502 --> 01:24:44.062
He was supposed to
give our daughter back.


1697
01:24:44.064 --> 01:24:45.045
Seriously, mark?

1698
01:24:45.065 --> 01:24:46.247
Trafficking?

1699
01:24:49.494 --> 01:24:51.269
And what about sasha?

1700
01:24:52.589 --> 01:24:54.272
What about sasha?

1701
01:24:54.274 --> 01:24:56.766
I was going to get
macie as I promised,


1702
01:24:56.768 --> 01:24:58.184
And that's all that matters.

1703
01:24:58.186 --> 01:24:59.852
You had an affair, mark,

1704
01:24:59.854 --> 01:25:02.447
And you kidnapped
someone's daughter.


1705
01:25:02.449 --> 01:25:04.006
I don't even know who you are.

1706
01:25:04.008 --> 01:25:06.768
Look, I was desperate.

1707
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:09.738
Why didn't you just
pay him the money, mark?


1708
01:25:09.740 --> 01:25:12.774
I paid them what I could.

1709
01:25:12.776 --> 01:25:14.776
And now we don't
have any more money.


1710
01:25:14.778 --> 01:25:16.127
And I pawned your jewelry.

1711
01:25:18.598 --> 01:25:21.207
And you took a bribe from ella,

1712
01:25:21.209 --> 01:25:24.443
A desperate mom who just wanted
a safe house for her daughter.


1713
01:25:24.445 --> 01:25:25.620
Roxanne, I'm sorry.

1714
01:25:25.622 --> 01:25:27.038
No.

1715
01:25:30.051 --> 01:25:31.276
Roxanne.

1716
01:25:31.278 --> 01:25:32.242
I'm sorry.

1717
01:25:32.262 --> 01:25:34.930
Macie!

1718
01:25:34.932 --> 01:25:36.647
I'm sorry.

1719
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:37.614
Macie!

1720
01:25:37.634 --> 01:25:39.968
Macie, I love you!

1721
01:26:05.245 --> 01:26:06.476
Last one.

1722
01:26:06.496 --> 01:26:09.330
Hope you're still hungry.

1723
01:26:09.332 --> 01:26:11.099
All right, girl.

1724
01:26:11.101 --> 01:26:14.102
One year of art school down,
and a summer of freedom ahead.


1725
01:26:14.104 --> 01:26:15.578
And work.

1726
01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:17.672
I won't be able to lounge
around all summer this year.


1727
01:26:17.674 --> 01:26:20.033
Mom has me busy painting.

1728
01:26:20.035 --> 01:26:21.384
Got to pay those bills.

1729
01:26:21.386 --> 01:26:22.768
That's right.

1730
01:26:22.770 --> 01:26:25.947
Even with the best
tenants in the world,


1731
01:26:25.949 --> 01:26:27.598
It is not cheap
living around here.


1732
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.858
Ok.

1733
01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:31.135
After dinner,
you girls need to go


1734
01:26:31.137 --> 01:26:35.156
Upstairs and clean your rooms,
because they are atrocious.


1735
01:26:35.158 --> 01:26:36.615
We're not kids.

1736
01:26:36.617 --> 01:26:38.225
I'm in college now.

1737
01:26:38.227 --> 01:26:39.175
Really?

1738
01:26:39.195 --> 01:26:40.537
Ok, college girl.

1739
01:26:40.539 --> 01:26:43.131
Why don't you go get
your laundry at least


1740
01:26:43.133 --> 01:26:44.432
And bring it down?

1741
01:26:44.434 --> 01:26:45.958
You know, roxanne's right.

1742
01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.352
You're old enough to
do your laundry now.


1743
01:26:47.354 --> 01:26:48.770
Well, it's either
that or you're wearing


1744
01:26:48.772 --> 01:26:50.754
My clothes next week, so...

1745
01:26:50.756 --> 01:26:52.206
Ok, I'll do it.

1746
01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:54.408
I'll do it.

1747
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:56.886
I love the new painting, macie.

1748
01:26:56.888 --> 01:26:58.238
Thanks.

1749
01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.431
Art school's already paying off.

1750
01:27:00.433 --> 01:27:02.767
My clients love them,
that's for sure.


1751
01:27:02.769 --> 01:27:04.735
I can't eat anymore.

1752
01:27:04.737 --> 01:27:05.669
I'm stuffed.

1753
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:06.871
Are you kidding me?

1754
01:27:06.873 --> 01:27:10.058
There's an entire pizza left.

1755
01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:13.461
How about we give it
to the new neighbors?


1756
01:27:14.572 --> 01:27:16.840
She's hardly had time to unpack.

1757
01:27:16.842 --> 01:27:18.867
Which is why she
would love a free pizza


1758
01:27:18.869 --> 01:27:20.326
From her friendly neighbors.

1759
01:27:20.328 --> 01:27:21.369
Give her some room.

1760
01:27:21.371 --> 01:27:22.587
She just got here.

1761
01:27:29.521 --> 01:27:30.845
Ok.

1762
01:27:30.847 --> 01:27:32.313
Leave it on the
doorstep at least.


1763
01:27:32.315 --> 01:27:33.898
The baby might be sleeping.

1764
01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.692
Ok.

1765
01:27:35.694 --> 01:27:38.219
I won't intrude, I promise.

1766
01:27:38.221 --> 01:27:39.353
Jeez.

1767
01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:43.858
You think I learned nothing?
