I have never done business with anybody, and Jerry is my witness,


60
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.440
從來  從來沒有
that I have ever, ever, ever...


61
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.380
我的保釋所有沒有
Does that phone ever ring...


62
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.310
有沒有接到過一次投訴電話
Has that phone ever rang with a complaint about me?

- The Duke. Yeah, I know who he is. - What do you know?


67
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.260
他在某個賭棍手下當會計師
He's that accountant that embezzled a couple of million


68
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.520
偷了人幾百萬然後全捐給了慈善機構
from some Vegas wise guy and gave it to charity.


69
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.530
沒錯  不過不是幾百萬
That's very good. Only thing is that it wasn't a couple of million.


70
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.060
是一千五百萬
It was $15 million.


71
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.830
而且不是什麼賭棍  是吉米·塞拉諾
It wasn't some Vegas wise guy. It was Jimmy Serrano.


72
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.340
知道  我能看懂報紙
I know. I know. I can read the papers.


73
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.350
無意揭你傷疤
Well, look, I don't wanna bring up the past,


74
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.990
不過塞拉諾不就是當初使手段
but isn't Serrano the guy that ran you out of Chicago


75
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.680
把你從芝加哥逼走的人嗎
when he was runnin' things back there?


76
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.020
-和他沒關係  -是哦
- He didn't run me out. - Yeah, right, right, right.


77
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.270
那你為什麼辭了警察來幹這狗屎行當
You gave up bein' a cop to do this shit?


78
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.980
-好吧  說重點  -重點就是  傑克
- All right, what's the point? - The point, Jack.


79
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.060
我把那個會計師保出來了
I bailed out the accountant.


80
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.870
那時候我還不知道他給誰幹活
See, I didn't know who he was at the time.


81
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.610
不然說什麼也不會給他代理
Had I known, there was no way I would've put up the bond.


82
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:44.850
塞拉諾肯定早晚
I mean, it's only a matter of time


83
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.760
得讓他從地球上消失
before Serrano vanishes this guy from the planet,


84
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.730
我就得賠四十五萬
and I'm out 450,000.


85
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.890
你保他花了四十五萬嗎
You're out 450,000 on this guy?


86
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.030
-不  不是  -不是嗎
- No. No. - No.


87
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.130
因為有你在  你是這行的翹楚
Because I got you, and you're the best,


88
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.790
一定能把他抓回來
and you're gonna find him and bring him back.


89
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.840
好吧
Yeah, right.


90
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.490
你怎麼知道這傢伙還活著
How do you even know this guy is still alive?


91
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.790
因為他腦子進水了
Because this guy is crazy.


92
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.940
寄了一堆明信片給塞拉諾
He sends postcards to Serrano,


93
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.470
告訴他  花他的錢玩的很開心
he's tellin' him what a great time he's havin' with his money.


94
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.000
離期限還有多久
How much time you got left?


95
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.740
週五午夜  不然我就得賠四十五萬
Friday midnight I default. I eat the 450.


96
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.450
這週五  只有五天  你逗我呢
This Friday? That's five days. Forget it.


97
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.140
-自己去找他吧  把錢給我  -好吧  聽我說
- You go find him. Give me my money. - All right. Listen to me.


98
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.490
這次我付你四...我付你五萬
I'll give you four... I'll give you fifty grand.


99
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.360
五萬  找你要一千二都那麼難  算了吧
Fifty grand? I gotta chase you down for 1,200. Forget about it.


100
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.320
不  不  傑克  拜託了
No, no, Jack, please.


101
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.570
拜託個屁  說什麼我都不接  還有什麼活
"Jack"? "Jack" nothin'. Forget it. What else you got?


102
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.360
天哪  沒別的活了  只有這個了
God! I ain't got nothin'. This is it.


103
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.320
你要找不到這傢伙  我就破產了
If you don't find this guy, I'm outta business.


104
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.370
艾迪  十萬我才做
Eddie... I'll do it for a hundred thousand.


105
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.260
十萬  你瘋了嗎
A hundred thousand? Are you outta your mind?


106
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.940
這活兒多容易  簡直輕而易舉  老天爺
This is an easy gig. It's a midnight run, for Christ's sakes!


107
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.350
你還不知道吧  我已經厭倦挨槍子了
Maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm tired of gettin' shot at.


108
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.630
我不想再幹這種操蛋的工作
I'm tired of this miserable fuckin' business,


109
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.180
和各種人渣打交道
every lowlife that I run into.


110
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.380
要付就得付合理的報酬
If you're gonna pay me, you gotta pay me what's right.


111
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.100
要我幹這活  就給我應得的報酬
You want me for this job? Give me what's right.


112
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.550

First of all, the guy is an accountant. He's not gonna shoot you.

你只要找到他
All you have to do is find him,

說起來容易  告訴你
Oh, that's easy for you to say. Listen to me.

Now, can I have my 1,200, please?


121

You're worse than any crook I ever put a bond up for.


122

You don't look like an F.B.I. agent to me.


250
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.820
是嗎  你也不像"公爵"啊
Yeah? Well, you don't look like a duke to me.


251
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.110
你要是調查局的特工
If you're an F.B.I. agent,


252
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:18.910
應該直接把我帶去你的辦公室
why don't you take me to the F.B.I. office?


253
00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:19.700
你再不閉嘴
If you don't be quiet,


254
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.150
我保證讓你記一輩子
this is gonna be the worst trip of your life.


255
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.850
你為吉米·塞拉諾工作是嗎
You work for Jimmy Serrano, don't you?


256
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.340
我才不替那個王八蛋做事
I don't work for that piece of shit.


257
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.570
你的保釋代理人雇我
Your bail bondsman hired me to


258
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.050
把你帶回洛杉磯
bring you back to L.A., and that's what I'm doin'.


259
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.150
-我有錢  -我知道
- I got money, you know? - I'm sure you do.


260
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.630
-你要多少我都給你  -閉上你的嘴
- I'll give you whatever you want. - Start by shutting up.


261
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.170
這才兩分鐘  我已經開始煩你了
I know you all of two minutes, and already I don't like you.


262
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.380
真遺憾  我倒挺喜歡你的
Gee, that's too bad. I really like you.


263
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.700
飛機裏我不能銬你
I can't keep you cuffed on a commercial flight,


264
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.100
槍也得辦托運
and I gotta check my gun with my luggage,


265
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.170
但你要敢耍花樣  我就扭斷你的脖子
but you fuck with me once, and I'm gonna break your neck.


266
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.870
-我不能坐飛機  -什麼

你沒聽錯  我不能坐飛機
You heard me, I can't fly.


268
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.100
不  不  這可輪不到你決定  夥計
No, no. You're gonna have to do better than that, pal.


269
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.160
我不需要決定什麼
I don't have to do better than that


270
00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.810
因為事實如此
because it's the truth I can't fly.


271
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.120
我有恐飛癥
I suffer from aviophobia.


272
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.270
-什麼癥  -我就是不能坐飛機
- What does that mean? - It means I can't fly.


273
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.680
我還有恐高癥和幽閉恐懼癥
I also suffer from acrophobia and claustrophobia.


274
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.130
你要再不聽話
I'll tell you what. If you don't cooperate,


275
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.340
馬上就會得"拳頭恐懼癥"
you're gonna suffer from "Fistaphobia."

'Cause they're starting to cut into my wrists. Thank you.


375
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.200
戴一會皮膚就受不了
You know, it just gets the skin after a while.


376
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.680
-進去  -你想幹什麼  怎麼了
- Get in there. - What do you want? What?


377
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.200
拜託  拜託
Oh, come on. Come on.


378
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.080
不  別這樣  為什麼把我關進來啊
No, you don't... Why would you do that?


379
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.810
旅途愉快  我住這間
You'll enjoy yourself. This is my room,


380
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.730
你住那間  晚安
and that's your room. Good night.


381
00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.090
歡迎來到洛杉磯

382
00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.090
歡迎來到洛杉磯

383
00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.090
歡迎來到洛杉磯

384
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.730
有什麼可以效勞的嗎
Hey, can I, uh, help you guys?


385
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:17.680
我是調查局特工莫斯利
Special Agent Mosely, F.B.I.


386
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.290
莫斯利  你們怎麼都叫莫斯利
"Mosely"? Are all you guys named "Mosely"?


387
00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:21.670
什麼意思
What are you talking about?


388
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.600
你是來接犯人的對嗎
You're here to pick up a prisoner, right?


389
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.170
-你怎麼知道  -他有恐飛癥
- How did you know that? - He was afraid to fly,


390
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.800
下飛機了
so he got off the plane.


391
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.460
和另一個莫斯利特工一起
He left with an Agent Mosely.


392
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.810
長官  這說明沃爾什拿了你的證件
Sir, that must mean that Walsh has your identification.


393
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:41.610
說
Yeah?


394
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.480
是蠢蛋一號嗎  讓蠢蛋二號接電話
Is this moron number one? Put moron number two on the phone.


395
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.430
好的  吉米  稍等
Yeah, Jimmy. He's, uh, right here. Hold on.


396
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.410
他挺生氣
He's pissed.


397
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.940
-怎麼了  -你不是說他坐飛機來嗎
- Yeah? - I thought you told me this guy was gonna be on the plane.


398
00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.330
我們打探到的消息是這樣的
That's the information we got.??


399
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.880
"我們打探到的消息是這樣的"  告訴你
"That's the information we got." I wanna tell you something.


400
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.520
我要這個人從世上消失  越快越好
I want this guy taken out, and I want him taken out fast.


401
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.760
你和另一個蠢貨
You and that other dummy better


402
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.060
最好立馬親自動手結果了他
start getting more personally involved in your work,


403
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.050
否則我一鉛筆戳死你倆
or I'm gonna stab you through the heart with a fucking pencil.


404
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.420
-明白嗎  -明白  吉米
- Do you understand me? - You got it, Jimmy.


405
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.450
托尼  他沒生我的氣吧
Tony, he ain't mad at me, is he?


406
00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:23.850
傑克
Jack?


407
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.070
傑克  這不合法吧
Jack, I th... I think this is illegal.


408
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.210
傑克  你不能把人這麼關在廁所裏
Jack, I don't think you can keep a person in a bathroom like this.


409
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.490
你  這地方太封閉了
Uh,you... It's very claustrophobic in here...


410
00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.410
是嗎  這樣吧
Yeah, it is? Well, I'll tell you what.


411
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.260
等到了洛杉磯
When we get to L.A.,


412
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.890
記得把這事告訴監獄的心理醫生
you can tell the prison psychiatrist all about it.


413
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.020
我要窒息了  這裏面根本不通風
There's no air. There's no ventilation in here.


414
00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.270
我跟你說過我有幽閉恐懼癥  拜託
I told you I was claustrophobic. Come on.


415
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.430
放我出來我又能怎樣
What do you think I'm gonna do?


416
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.100
從時速90英里的火車上跳下去嗎
Jump off a train moving 90 miles an hour?


417
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:56.890
傑克  傑克
Jack? Jack.


418
00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.300
傑克
Jack?


419
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.230
太好了  謝謝  謝謝
Good. Thanks. Thanks.


420
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:13.110
多謝你了  太好了
Thanks a lot. Oh, good.


421
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.630
-坐下  -好的  太好了  你真好
- Sit down. - Oh, yeah, that's great. Very kind of you.


422
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.610
不錯  好多了  謝謝  真好
Nice. Much better. Thank you. Good.


423
00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.150
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?


424
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.850
我嗎  算賬呢
What am I doin'? Arithmetic.


425
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:40.690
算賬  沒準我能幫上你  我搞會計的
Arithmetic? Maybe I can help you. I am an accountant.


426
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.920
我是這麼打算的
Well, you know, what I was thinkin',


427
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.290
等把你交出去  拿到錢以後
after I turn your ass in and collect my money,


428
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.520
開一家不錯的小咖啡館
I'm gonna open up a nice little coffee shop.


429
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.490
我到底值多少錢  能問問嗎
How much exactly are you getting for me, if I may ask?


430
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.980
這不是你該操心的事
I don't think that's any of your concern,


431
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.620
不過告訴你也就告訴你了
but I'll tell you just to... just to tell you.


432
00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:58.490
-十萬  -十萬
- A hundred thousand. - A hundred thousand?


433
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.070
那我給你十萬是不是就能放我走了
Does that mean you'd take a hundred thousand to let me go?


434
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.140
-門都沒有  -二十萬
- Not by a long shot. - Two hundred thousand?


435
00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.650
我這輩子就沒受過賄
I never took a payoff in my life,


436
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.690
更別說從你這樣的人身上破例了
and I'm not gonna start with someone like you.


437
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.620
-為什麼  -因為你是個該死的罪犯
- Why not? - Because you're a fuckin' criminal,


438
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.440
坐牢是你罪有應得
and you deserve to go where you're goin',


439
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.510
而我就是把你抓進去的人
and I'm gonna take you there.


440
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.690
再讓我聽到類似的話  我就揍爛你的臉
And if I hear more shit out of you, I'm gonna bust your head,


441
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.890
把你扔回該死的廁所
put you back in that fuckin' hole,


442
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:20.840
再把你的頭
and I'm gonna stick your head


443
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.370
狠狠地塞進馬桶裏
in the fuckin' toilet bowl and I'm gonna make it stay there.


444
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.980
還是提醒你一下  餐飲業可不好幹
Well, I have to tell you, a restaurant is a very tricky investment.


445
00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.870
超過五成的人在半年內破產
More than half of them go under within the first six months.


446
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.710
我要是你的會計師  絕對大力反對你的想法
If I were your accountant, I'd strongly advise you against it.


447
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.790
是嗎  可惜你不是我的會計師
You would? Well, you're not my accountant.


448
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.710
我只是假設我是你的會計師  就...
No, I mean, if I were your accountant, I'd...


449
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:44.240
我把你從這帶走...
I told you, I took you out of here...


450
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.930
不  我就是說非常不好幹
No, I'm just saying that it's a very very tricky business,


451
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.580
如果我是你的會計師
and if I were your accountant,


452
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:50.900
我一定會大力反對你投資餐飲
I would really strongly have to advise you against it,


453
00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.080
作為  作為你的會計師
as a... as an accountant.


454
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.390
-你不是我的會計師  -我知道
- You're not my accountant. - I realize I'm not your accountant.


455
00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.060
我說假如我是你的會計師而已
I'm just saying if I were your accountant.


456
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.580
傑裏  他他媽怎麼就錯過飛機了
Jerry, how the hell could he miss the goddamn plane?


457
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.650
他從機場打的電話啊
He called from the airport!


458
00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.770
好吧  打給馬文吧  對嗎
All right. It's time to bring in Marvin. All right?


459
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:15.480
打給他  他在匹茲堡呢
Call him up. He's in Pittsburgh.


460
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.890
-馬文·道夫勒  -對  道夫勒
- Marvin Dorfler? - Yeah, Dorfler.


461
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.560
D開頭  名字叫王八蛋那個
Under "D" in the rolodex for "Jerk", Jerry.


462
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.840
至少分我點薯條吧
Can I at least have some french fries?


463
00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.420
不可能  混球  閉嘴吧
I said no, pecker breath. Now shut up.


464
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:36.670
我是道夫勒
Yeah, Dorfler.


465
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.580
馬文  老夥計  還好有你在
Marvin? Sweetheart, am I glad I got you.


466
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.920
-老哥  有個活給你  -說吧  聽著呢
- Boy, do I have a job for you! - Yeah? I'm listening.


467
00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.390
首先  我得向你道歉
First of all, I gotta apologize,


468
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.940
我們之前到處找你
because we were trying to find you,


469
00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.350
這活實在太重要了  但我找不到你
and it's a very important job, and I couldn't find you.


470
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.030
只好給了沃爾什  他卻搞砸了  所以
So I had to give it to Walsh, but he's fucking it up, so...


471
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.050
真不明白你為什麼還要雇那個傻逼
I don't know why you keep hiring that fuckin' guy.


472
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.590
我知道  對不起
I know. I... I apologize.


473
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.820
你是這行的翹楚
You are the best at what you do. You know that?


474
00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.680
-聽說過喬納森·馬度卡斯嗎  -沒
- Now listen. Do you know who Jonathan Mardukas is? - No.


475
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.700
喬納森·馬度卡斯  "公爵"
Jonathan Mardukas? The Duke?


476
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.110
艾迪  我從沒聽說過這人
Eddie, I never heard of him.


477
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:05.350
好吧  不重要  重要的是
All right, listen, that's not important. What's important is that


478
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.640
你得找到他並把他帶回來  好嗎
you find him and you bring him back, okay?


479
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.290
我最後和他們通話時他倆在紐約
Now, last I heard, he had him in New York,


480
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.090
現在我也不知道他倆跑哪兒去了
and now I don't know where the hell they are.


481
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.100
找到他們  沃爾什的工錢就歸你了
If you find 'em, I'll give you what I'm givin' Walsh.


482
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.680
是嗎  多少
Yeah? What's that?


483
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.430
兩萬五
Twenty-five thousand.


484
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.520
但你得在週五午夜前帶他回來
But you gotta have him back by Friday midnight,


485
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.570
不然一切免談
otherwise the deal is off.


486
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.730
別擔心  艾迪  為了那兩萬五
Yeah, well, don't worry, Eddie. For 25 grand,


487
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.430
抬也給抬回來了
I'll bring him in on a silver platter.


488
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.010
隨你怎麼辦  把人帶來就行了
Bring him, uh, any way you want, but bring him, okay?


489
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.170
再見
Bye.


490
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.850
-喂  人渣  -我叫卡爾米  混蛋
- Hey, scumbag. - My name's Carmine, fucko.


491
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.380
好吧  卡爾米  今天算你走運
Yeah, well, Carmine, today's your lucky day.


492
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.010
-走什麼運  -閉嘴
- Why is today my lucky day? - Shut up!

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.030
對  對  我名叫傑克·沃爾什

抱歉  全名是約翰·衛斯理·沃爾什
Uh, excuse me. John Wesley Walsh.


495
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.410
我信用卡丟了
Yeah, I think I lost my credit card.


496
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.650
能幫我查查最後在哪兒用過嗎
Can you tell me the last place I used it?

Yeah, 7314-8395-2113.


498
00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.650
中央火車站的美鐵辦公室嗎
The Amtrak office, Grand Central Station?


499

好的  十分感謝
Yeah, okay. Yeah, thanks very much.


501
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.340
順便把這張卡作廢吧
Hey, uh, maybe we oughta cancel that card, huh?


502
00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.560
好的  謝謝
Yeah. Thank you.


503
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.670
知道動脈硬化嗎
Familiar with the word "Arteriosclerosis"?


504
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.330
膽固醇呢
Cholesterol?


505
00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.220
我可以給你列一張均衡飲食的清單
If you want, I'll outline a complete balanced diet for you.


506
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.240
記得從監獄寄給我
Well, mail it to me from "C" Block.


507
00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:50.000
-為什麼要吃這個  -為什麼  好吃唄
- Why would you eat that? - Why? 'Cause it tastes good.


508
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.490
-但對身體不好  -我知道
- But it's not good for you. - I'm aware of that.


509
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.010
明知對身體不好為什麼還要吃呢
Why do something that you know is not good for you?


510
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.610
因為我不在乎
Because I don't think about it.


511
00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.580
你這是在逃避現實
Well, that's living in denial.


512
00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.150
-逃避現實  -對
- Living in denial? - Yeah.


513
00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.900
-這我也知道  -你什麼都知道
- I'm aware of that. - So you're aware of all your behavior,


514
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.980
卻依然堅持做對自己無益的事
yet you continue to do things that aren't good for you.


515
00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.230
聽起來有些蠢  你說呢  傑克
That sounds sort of foolish. Don't you think so, Jack?


516
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.340
不  偷了吉米·塞拉諾一千五百萬才叫蠢
No. Stealing $15 million from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish.


517
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.640
-我以為自己不會被捕  -這才叫逃避現實
- I didn't think I'd get caught. - Now, that's livin' in denial.


518
00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.980
-我知道  -所以你什麼都知道
- I'm aware of that. - Oh, so you're aware of your behavior,


519
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.080
也依然堅持做對自己無益的事
and yet you continue to do things that aren't good for you.


520
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.220
我看也挺蠢的
Sounds kind of foolish to me.


521
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.480
-你說呢  喬恩  -是很蠢
- Don't you think, Jon? - It was foolish.


522
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.600
但是從黑幫手中偷了一千五百萬
But taking 15 million in Mob money


523
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.310
捐給慈善機構能幫助很多人
and giving it to charity was good for a lot of people.


524
00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.000
你惹毛一個黑手黨老大
So you pissed off a mafioso killer


525
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.150
就為了讓一堆陌生人對你感恩戴德
just to be loved by a bunch of fuckin' strangers.


526
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.740
-真是好主意  -你不希望自己受人愛戴嗎
- That makes a lot of sense. - Don't you want to be loved?


527
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.570
-很多人都愛我  -是嗎
- Lots of people love me. - Really?


528
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:50.790
誰
Who?


529
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.310
我前妻和女兒在芝加哥
I got an ex-wife and I got a daughter in Chicago.


530
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.520
他們怎麼受得了你這張嘴
How do they put up with all your sarcasm?


531
00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.790
問得好  我們有九年沒見過面了
Beautifully. I haven't seen either of them in nine years.


532
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.480
要不去看看他們
Think maybe we should go see them?


533
00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.760
我看還是算了吧
No, I don't think maybe we should go see them.


534
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.830
不過多謝你的好意了
Thanks for the interest, though.


535
00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.830
你幹這行他們肯定不好過吧
The job must have been tough on 'em.


536
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.850
-我以前不幹這個  -那你做什麼的
- I didn't do this then. - What did you do?


537
00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:17.660
-警察  -你在芝加哥當警察
- I was a cop. - You were a cop in Chicago?


538
00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.440
那你一定對吉米·塞拉諾瞭如指掌
Then you must know all about Jimmy Serrano.


539
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.970
-你哪來的權利問這問那  -不行嗎
- Do you have the right to ask me certain questions? - I think I do.


540
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:27.530
-不  不行  -我覺得我有權問你
- No, you don't. - I think I do.


541
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.920
-不  你沒有  -為什麼
- No, you don't. - Why not?


542
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.570
吃完了  走吧
Dinner's over. Let's go.


543
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.460
我就知道這趟夠我受的  夥計
I can see this is gonna be some fuckin' trip, boy.


544
00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.770
換我就不會擔心  傑克
I wouldn't worry about it, Jack.


545
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:41.860
咱倆在一起待不了多久了
I'm not gonna be with you that much longer.


546
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.500
-什麼意思  -以我對塞拉諾的瞭解
- What do you mean? - Well, with what I know about Serrano,


547
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.700
我一入獄  一天之內必死
if I go to jail, I'll be dead within 24 hours.


548
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.270
所以還不如趁早從你手裏開溜
So sooner or later, I'm gonna have to give you the slip.


549
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.260
那是
Sure.


550
00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.010
難得把你逗笑一次
Glad you find it humorous.


551
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.580
走吧
- Let's go.


552
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.460
小費你只給兩美元
Two dollars? That's all you're gonna leave?


553
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:02.540
-那是15%  -那是13%
- That's 15%. - That's 13%.


554
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.720
這些人靠小費為生
These people depend on tips for a living.


555
00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.810
有事嗎  先生
Uh, can I, uh, help you, sir?

你他媽怎麼找到我在哪兒的
How the fuck did you find out where I am?


564
00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.250

Fuck you shit! I ain't tellin' you shit!


565
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:54.070
你這是在逼我用非常手段
You're gonna force me to do something I don't wanna do!


566
00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.240
發生什麼事了
What's goin' on in here?


567
00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.590
沒事  一切盡在掌控中
All right. Everything's under control.

好消息還是壞消息
Is this good news or bad news?


574
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.340
據說馬度卡斯和沃爾什改乘火車

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.640
這卡不可能已經作廢了
There is no way that that could be canceled.


620
00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.110
-人家說作廢了  -閉嘴

- Would you just try that again? - No.


625
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:07.630
好吧
All right.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.500
阿朗佐...傑克·沃爾什  調查局特工

I'm taking him to Los Angeles, okay? So please try this once more.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.780
證件上的名字可不是傑克·沃爾什  先生
Jack Walsh is not the name on that badge, sir.


631
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.500
需要我打給聯調局嗎
Would you like me to call the F.B.I.?


632
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:31.060
或者您還是付現金吧
Or would you like to pay cash?

兩張票共兩百六十四美元

You call that a lot of money, huh?


638
00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.880
買車票倒是夠了

Got the whole fuckin' force after me, huh?

他媽的  我什麼都沒干
Oh, goddamn it! I didn't do anything.


643
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.220
放鬆  就問你幾個問題而已
Relax. Just wanna ask you a few questions. That's all.


644
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.020
真客氣  隨便抽啊
Yeah. Fuckin' "A." Help yourself.


645
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:52.340
你對傑克·沃爾什瞭解多少
So, what do you know about Jack Walsh?


646
00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:00.410
別  別  拜託  吸煙有害健康
Ah, no, no. Come on. Come on. Cigarettes are killers.


647
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.210
-女人也一樣  -那是你沒遇到對的人
- So are women. - Not the right woman.


648
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.130
我老婆和我關係就很好
My wife and I have a wonderful relationship.


649
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.780
她一直堅守在我身邊
She stuck it out with me through all of this.


650
00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.590
是守你那幾千萬吧  真辛苦她了
Yeah, stuck it out with you and all your millions. What a trouper.


651
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.910
我沒有幾千萬  傑克  全捐給慈善了好嗎
I don't have millions, Jack. I gave it all to charity, remember?


652
00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.220
自己沒留下點嗎  喬恩
You didn't keep just a little for yourself, Jon?


653
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:18.250
-就留了點逃命錢  -是哦
- I kept enough to get away and stay hidden. - Yeah, right.


654

我們要在芝加哥轉車
You know, we change buses in Chicago.

中間有幾小時空當
You're gonna have a couple hours.


656
00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.550
趁這機會
You would be a better man


657
00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.900
去看看你前妻和女兒多好
if you use that time to look up your ex-wife and daughter.


658
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.200
這是個好機會
It's a perfect opportunity.


659
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.110
別多管閒事
Why don't you mind your own business.


660
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.300
問你個事  為什麼九年都不見他們一面
Let me ask you this. Why is it you haven't seen them in nine years?


661
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:38.110
-為什麼  -對
- Why? - Yeah.


662
00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.520
好好好  告訴你  真煩人
That's... Just to get you off my back, I'll tell you why.


663
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.180
她嫁了一個警督
She married a police lieutenant,


664
00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:44.630
而我在芝加哥警局名聲又不好  行了吧
and I'm not very popular with the Chicago Police Department, okay?


665
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:45.960
為什麼你在芝加哥警局名聲不好
Why aren't you popular with the Chicago police?


666
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.280
那是另一碼事了
That's a whole other...


667
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.970
和你很熟嗎  你...簡直
What, do we know each other? Get... What a...


668
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.280
-為什麼  -為什麼
- Why? - Why?


669
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.470
你幹了什麼
What did you do?


670
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:56.940
為什麼你在芝加哥警局名聲不好
Why aren't you popular with the Chicago Police Department?


671
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.030
那不關你的事
That's something that really doesn't concern you.


672
00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:00.350
她傷你心了嗎  傑克
She hurt you, Jack?


673
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.490
是
Yeah.


674
00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.510
-抱歉  -你道什麼歉
- I'm sorry. - What are you sorry about?


675
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.940
-抱歉揭你傷疤了  -我哪有傷疤
- I'm sorry you're hurt. - I'm not hurt.


676
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.400
-你剛說她傷你心了  -我才沒傷心
- You just said you were hurt. - I'm not hurt.


677
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.120
你剛說你傷心了
You just said you were hurt.


678
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.910
我沒說我傷心了  是你說的
I didn't say I was hurt. You said I was hurt.


679
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:14.000
我問你是不是傷心了
I asked if you were hurt,


680
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.060
你說  對  我傷心了
and you said, "Yeah, I'm hurt."


681
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.770
那是  你讓我說的
That's... Because you... you made me say it.


682
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:18.070
你不那麼問我也不會說出來
You're starting to put words in my mouth.


683
00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.070
傑克  你是個成年人了
Jack, you're a grown man.


684
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.540
應該知道自己要說什麼
You have control over your own words.


685
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.590
真他媽對
You're goddamn right I do.


686
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.490
送你五個字  快他媽閉嘴
So here come two words for you: Shut the fuck up!


687
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:31.360
打擾一下  沃爾什半小時前
Excuse me. Walsh called Mascone


688
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.820
在托萊多郊外給莫斯康打了電話
about half an hour ago from outside Toledo.


689
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:38.420
他在去芝加哥的州際巴士上
He's on an Interstate Coach Lines bus headed for Chicago.


690
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.200
走吧
Come on.


691
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.260
長官  這傢伙怎麼辦
Sir, what do we do with this guy?


692
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.290
放了
Let him go.


693
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.440
那王八蛋拿了我的煙
Son of a bitch stole my cigarettes.


694
00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.240
你上次拍胸片是什麼時候
When's the last time you had a chest X ray?


695
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.200
聽說過二手煙嗎
You know about secondary smoke?


696
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.990
很多無辜的  健康的人
You could give people lung cancer


697
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.280
可能會因為你得上肺癌
wh... who are innocent and tryin' to live healthy lives.


698
00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.160
你再睡會吧  讓我清靜一會
Why don't you just go back to sleep? Leave me alone.


699
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:15.850
想幹什麼隨便你
Do whatever you have to do.


700
00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:17.080
你還是把煙掐了吧
Why don't you put the cigarette out?


701
00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.130
你就不能消停會兒
Why don't you shut up and leave me alone?


702
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.900
把煙掐了吧  傑克

Pain in the ass this guy is.


705
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:31.270
謝謝  謝謝  我還以為你是要掐了呢
Thank you. Thank you. I thought you were putting it out.


706
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:32.750
不  誰說我要掐了
No, I'm not putting it out.


707
00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.870
為什麼你在芝加哥警局名聲不好
Why aren't you popular with the Chicago Police Department?


708
00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.520
希德在樓下
Sid's downstairs.


709
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.730
-怎麼了  -咱倆該談談了
- What's up? - I think you and I should talk.


710
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.110
你在這晃悠什麼  出去
What are you hangin' around for? Take a walk.


711
00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:52.020
聽說有人在紐約找到馬度卡斯了
I heard somebody picked up Mardukas in New York.


712
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.400

It's old news. I'm already on it.


713
00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:54.520
你應該知道  如果他成了污點證人
I don't have to tell you what'll happen


714
00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.930
會有什麼後果
if he becomes a government witness.


715
00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.800
我保證他聯繫不到警方
I can assure you that will not be the case.


716
00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.840
我猜你肯定派人處理了
I assumed you were taking that position,


717
00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.930
但我是來勸你別這麼冒險的
but I am supposed to advise you against such acts.

那都是塞拉諾的手下
Those are Serrano's people back there.


742

他們不想等你進監獄
They're not waiting for you to get to jail.


743
00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.980
那為什麼不把我交給聯調局的人
You're turnin' me in. Why are we runnin'away from the F.B.I.?

746
00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:37.070
我不可能給別人
I won't give you to the feds.


747
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:41.700
"阿朗佐·莫斯利"  這不是你假冒的特工嗎
"Alonzo Mosely." Isn't that the name you've been using?


748
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.760
給我瞧瞧
Let me see that.


749
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.670
-你看這些記錄  -怎麼了
- Look at this wealth of information. - What?


750
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.840
他們竊聽了莫斯康的電話
They got a tap on Mascone's line.


751
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.130
王八蛋
Son of a bitch!


752
00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.740
你要幹什麼  你要幹什麼
What are ya doin'? What are ya doin'?


753
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.880
你覺得開著偷來的警車能跑多遠
How far do you think we're gonna get in a stolen F.B.I. car?


754
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:09.670
-這是幹什麼  -阿朗佐才懂的玩笑
- What's that for? - An inside joke between me and Alonzo.


755
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:13.630
-托尼·達爾沃在一號線  -說
- Tony Darvo, line one. - Yeah?


756
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.250
抱歉  吉米  搞砸了
Sorry, Jimmy. It didn't happen.


757
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.190
搞砸了  你再說一遍  托尼
It didn't happen? Say that again, Tony.


758
00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:21.170
真搞砸了  周圍全是條子
It just didn't happen. There was cops all over the place.


759
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:23.350
來了一堆聯調局的人  吉米
There was a million fuckin' feds all over. Jimmy,


760
00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:25.840
場面太亂了  真的太混亂了
it was a mess. It was a real mess.


761
00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.280
-趕緊掛了吧  -希德尼
- You'd better get off the line. - Sidney,


762
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.770
他們要是竊聽了這通電話
If they've got a tap on that line...


763
00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.980
希德尼  閉上你的臭嘴
Sidney, shut your fuckin' mouth!


764
00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.730
聽好了  蠢貨
Now, listen to me, dummy.


765
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.110
他們抓到馬度卡斯了嗎
Do they have Mardukas in custody or not?


766
00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:37.860
我  我  吉米  我不知道
I don't... I don't... Jimmy, I don't know.


767
00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.750
遍地都是條子
The cops are swarming all over the place.


768
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.890
根本看不清人
We couldn't see anything.


769
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.600
你們兩個蠢貨聽好了
Let me tell you two stupid motherfuckers something.


770
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.230
再讓我聽到這樣的消息
I don't wanna get another phone call like this, because if I do,


771
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:47.730
我就飛過去
I'm gonna get on a fuckin' plane,


772
00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:49.350
把你倆砍了當柴燒
and I'm gonna blow torch the both of you.


773
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.500
明白嗎
Do you understand?


774
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.760
你能消停會嗎  我和吉米說正事呢
Are you gonna stop? I'm on the phone talkin' to Jimmy.


775
00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.590
別鬧
What are you doin'?


776
00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:57.450
那時候在芝加哥就該殺了沃爾什
I should've killed Walsh in Chicago a long time ago.


777
00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:00.650
別說話  希德尼  一個字都別說
Don't say a word to me, Sidney. Don't say a fuckin' word to me.


778
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:03.200
不然我把這電話塞你嘴裏
I'll get up and I'll bury this telephone in your head.


779
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.490
難以置信
I can't believe this.


780
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.170
我已經九年沒見他們了
I haven't seen them in nine years,


781
00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.530
終於見到了  我卻得張口說
and the first thing out of my mouth is gonna be,


782
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.260
"能借我幾百塊嗎"
"Can I borrow a few hundred bucks?"


783
00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.500
我有預感來這對你大有好處
I have a feeling this is gonna be very good for you.


784
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:52.950
你挺帥的
You look fine.


785
00:49:57.810 --> 00:49:59.640
你們是誰
Who are you guys?


786
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.020
我是你媽媽的前夫
I'm your mother's ex-husband.


787
00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.590
媽

788
00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:07.320

794
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.420
怎麼說的  有好話嗎
What'd they say? Anything good?


795
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.540
沒  你沒事吧
No. Are you all right?


796
00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.080

797
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.620
你惹了不少麻煩  傑克
You're in a lot of trouble, Jack.


798

799
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.790
我能進屋待幾分鐘嗎
Can I come in for a few minutes?


800
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.760
進來吧
Yeah.


801
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:02.370
我不久留
I won't stay long.


802
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.730
不過得借你些錢去洛杉磯
I just need to borrow some money to get to L.A.


803
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.100
你知道我信用很好
You know I'm good for it.


804
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.640
傑克  家裏沒有那麼多現金
Jack, I don't think I have that kind of cash in the house.


805
00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:15.080
我現在騎虎難下  處境很尷尬  蓋爾
I'm so embarrassed, I... I'm just in a jam, Gail. It...

傑克  你不該來這
Jack, you shouldn't be here.


810
00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.640
要是被泰德看到了  你倆會被逮捕的

Then we'd be in a lot of trouble,


813

-她不是這個意思  -喬恩  你別管
- I don't think she was saying that. - Listen, Jon. Stay out of this.

你還是那個臭脾氣  自己不好過
Same old Jack. You get your feelings hurt,


823
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.820
周圍所有人也別想好過
and then you walk around and hurt everybody else.


824
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.140
我真不想聽你說教
Last thing I need now is one of your lectures.


825
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.560
我沒有跟你說教  蠢貨
I'm not lecturing you! You stupid!


826
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.560
我是想保護你

827
00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.640
-得了吧  -泰德隨時都可能到家
- Aw, come on. - Ted is gonna be home any minute.

Let me guess. What, it's payoff night?


831

-好吧  夠了  滾出去  -別吵了
- All right, that's it! Get out! - Let's not fight.


832
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.800
我現在困在這了
Listen, I'm in a big fuckin'jam!

and I'm out of this miserable fuckin' business forever!

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.660
我不是在和你講話  我是在和別人講話
I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to the other guys.


874
00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:27.990
什麼別人
What other guys?


875
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:29.440
我給你描述一下
Well, let me describe the scene to you.


876
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:30.630
這些傢伙
There's these guys, see?


877
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.680
已經蹲了大概兩天了吧
They've probably been up for, like, two days.


878
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:35.130
腋臭嚴重  滿嘴咖啡味
They stink of B.O. They have coffee breath.


879
00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:38.260
因為坐得太久飽受便秘煩惱
They're constipated from sittin' on their asses for so long.


880
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.310
他們就坐在一輛麵包車裏
They're sitting in a van,


881
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:42.060
可能就停在你辦公室的街對面
and they're probably parked right up the street from your office.


882
00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.140
但現在你們可以捲鋪蓋回家了
But now, you guys, you're gonna have to pack up and go home,


883
00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.920
因為你們露餡了  傻逼們
because I'm on to you, you dumb fucks.


884
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.240
艾迪  你的電話被竊聽了
Eddie, your phone is tapped.


885
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.620
我再也不會打這個電話了  去秦盧餐廳
Listen, I'm not gonna use this line anymore. Go to Chin Loo's.


886
00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:53.770
五分鐘以後我打過去
I'll call you there in five minutes.


887
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:57.050
他們來不及竊聽那的電話  再見  各位
They can't run a tap that fast. So long, everybody.


888
00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.720
請讓讓  夥計  我來接  我來接
Excuse me, buddy. I got it, I got it.


889
00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.240
是打給我的  傑克  是你嗎
I think it's for me. Jack, that you?


890
00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.960
立刻匯五百塊
Listen, I need you to wire me 500


891
00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.750
到德州阿馬裏洛的西聯匯款辦事處
to the Western Union office in Amarillo, Texas, right away.


892
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:11.220
等等  坐個巴士要五百塊
Wait a minute. What do you need with $500 on a bus?


893
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.860
而且你他媽怎麼沒坐飛機回來
And why the fuck aren't you on a plane?


894
00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:13.880
我沒告訴過你
Did it ever occur to you


895
00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.880
我是專業人士  做事自有道理嗎
that I am a professional and that I might have my reasons?


896
00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.070
我們改自己開車了
We are driving now.


897
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.990
身上的錢只夠到阿馬裏洛
I only have enough cash to get to Amarillo.


898
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:21.640
巴士沒法坐了
We had to scrap the bus.


899
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:24.620
別管巴士了  你們他媽的為什麼不坐飛機呢
Fuck the bus! I wanna know what happened to the goddamn plane!


900
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:29.220
-他不喜歡坐飛機  -他不喜歡坐飛機
- He doesn't like to fly. - He doesn't like to fly?


901
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.940
搞什麼飛機  聽好了  傑克
What the fuck does that mean? Listen to me, Jack!


902
00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.640
這兩天半內你們最好給老子滾回來
You gotta be back here in less than two-and-a-half fuckin' days.


903
00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.430
那他媽可是五十萬
A half million dollars of my money!


904
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.210
你他媽到底在晃悠什麼
What the fuck is goin' on there?


905
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:40.340
艾迪  艾迪  艾迪  我發誓
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, I swear to God.


906
00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.470
有氣別撒在我頭上
Don't start with me now,


907
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:44.710
不然老子崩了他丟沼澤裏埋了你信不
or I will shoot him and I will dump him in a fuckin' swamp!


908
00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.860
我他媽沒心情和你吵
I am in no fuckin' mood for this.


909
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.270
把錢匯過來  我會把他按時帶到
Just send the money, and I'll have him back by the deadline.


910
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.140
-聽到了嗎  -聽到了
- You hear me? - Yes.


911
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.460
走吧
Let's go.


912
00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.170
傑裏  馬上匯五百塊到德州阿馬裏洛  傑克·沃爾什的賬號
Jerry, wire $500 to Jack Walsh in Amarillo, Texas, right away.


913
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.710
德州的阿馬裏洛  對了
Amarillo, Texas. Now, listen, also.


914
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:06.710
讓道夫勒也過去  趕緊找他過去
Get Dorfler down there! Find him and get him down there too.


915
00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.470
-好的  艾迪  -媽的
- You got it, Eddie. - Shit!


916
00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:14.150
一個啤酒瓶掉下來
One of those bottles of beer should fall


917
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:17.170
九十六個啤酒瓶在牆頭
Ninety-six bottles of beer on the wall


918
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:20.670
九十六個啤酒瓶在牆頭
Ninety-six bottles of beer on the wall


919
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:27.370
九...
Nine...


920
00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:35.390
九十三個啤酒瓶在牆頭
Ninety-three bottles of beer on the wall


921
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:41.160
為什麼你在芝加哥警局名聲不好
Why were you so unpopular with the Chicago Police Department?


922
00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:43.890
因為你太有個性
'Cause of your personality?


923
00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:49.710
剛才在你家怎麼回事  到底怎麼了
What happened back at your house? What was that all about?


924
00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.890
你老婆嫁了個黑警察
Your wife married a corrupt police officer?


925
00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.650
到底怎麼了
What was it all about?


926
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:03.330
整個警局都他媽被買通了
That whole fuckin' department was corrupt.


927
00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:05.440
-哪都有好人和壞人  -也是
- There's good and bad everywhere, don't you think? -Yeah.


928
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:08.820
壞人滿地跑  至於好人就不知道了
Well, I'd say there's bad everywhere. Good I don't know about.


929
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.570
那你呢
What happened to you?


930
00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:20.680
我沒拿他們的黑錢
I wouldn't go on the payroll.


931
00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.790
什麼黑錢
What payroll?


932
00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:27.610
當時我是臥底
I was workin' undercover. I was


933
00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.040
已經成功接近這個芝加哥的大毒梟
close to this guy, this big heroin dealer in Chicago.


934
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.850
全城的毒品都是他供
He supplied the whole city.


935
00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.300
花了我一年時間取得他的信任
Took me a year just to get his confidence.


936
00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.240
我馬上要找到決定性證據了
Just when I was about to nail the son of a bitch,


937
00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.510
我的同事
my, uh, fellow officers...


938
00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:46.010
神奇地從我家裏找出了七磅的海洛因
mysteriously discovered seven pounds of heroin in my house.


939
00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:50.070
所以這個大毒梟給了我兩個選擇
So this big-time drug dealer gave me a choice:


940
00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:52.740
像別的警察一樣拿錢  然後跑路
Get on the payroll like everybody else, get out of town,


941
00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:54.780
或者去蹲三十年監獄
or go to jail for 30 years.


942
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:57.890
我沒拿他們的黑錢
Well, I didn't get on the payroll,


943
00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.090
所以後來我才來幹這個
and that's why I do this.


944
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:04.070
找到你這樣的罪犯  送進監獄
So when I find a criminal like you, I bring him in.


945
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:06.190
不用擔心誰收了賄賂
I don't have to worry about anybody takin'a payoff,


946
01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:08.530
因為沒有別人  自己單干
because there is no anybody... there's just me.


947
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:20.480
怎麼不買個新表
Why don't you get a new watch?


948
01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.250
等我多瞭解你一些再告訴你
I'll tell you when I know you better.


949
01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.060
瞭解我  你什麼時候才會更瞭解我
You know me better? When are you gonna get to know me better?


950
01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:26.030
我倒是會越來越瞭解你
I'll get to know you better.


951
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.050
-你卻不會更瞭解我  -能閉上嘴嗎
- You're not gonna get to know me better. - Will you shut up?


952
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:29.630
閉上嘴你怎麼瞭解我
That's what I mean.


953
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.600
咱們還剩多少錢
How much money do we have left?


954
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.410
-就這麼多  -就這麼多
- That's it? - That's it.


955
01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.230
我們都要餓死了  你還拿錢去買煙
We're starvin', and you're buying cigarettes?


956
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:03.880
這是我的精神食糧
I need these cigarettes.


957
01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:06.460
要點什麼隨便你  我有煙就夠了
You can have your whatever you're gonna have. I'll have this.


958
01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.710
-先生們  來點什麼  -咖啡  謝謝
- What can I do for you boys? - Coffee, please.


959
01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.440
-咖啡多少錢  -五十三美分
- How much is the coffee? - It's 53 cents.


960
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:19.040
-茶呢  -五十三美分
- How much is tea? - Fifty-three cents.


961
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:23.740
我喝茶吧
I'll have tea.


962
01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:26.700
好的  今早特供是辣腸炒蛋
Okay, and our breakfast special today is chorizo and eggs.


963
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:27.880
辣腸炒蛋
Chorizo and eggs?


964
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:30.040
-辣腸炒蛋  是的  -那是什麼
- Chorizo and eggs. Yes. - Chorizo and eggs? What is that?


965
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.890
墨西哥辣腸
It's a Mexican sausage


966
01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:33.320
配上炒雞蛋
mixed in with scrambled eggs,


967
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:34.960
配菜還有薯餅和吐司
and it comes with hash browns and toast.


968
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.510
我們不要  謝謝
We won't be havin' that. Thank you.


969
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:44.430
幾點了
What time you got?


970
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:48.920
-八點五十  -好吧  十分鐘以後
- Ten to 9:00. - All right, in 10 minutes,


971
01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.170
咱們去西聯匯款辦事處取五百塊
we'll be at the Western Union office, we'll have 500 bucks.


972
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.970
想吃牛排都行  我請客
I'll buy you a juicy steak or whatever you want.


973
01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:56.950
辣腸炒蛋
Chorizo and eggs.


974
01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:01.100
-辣腸炒蛋  -想吃什麼都給你買
- Chorizo and eggs. - I'll get you whatever you want.


975
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:07.750
喬恩  今天的一切都是你自己造成的
You know, Jon, you're in this mess because you're in this mess.


976
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:09.530
不是我害的
I didn't put you in this mess.


977
01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.710
-明白嗎  -好吧
- Do you understand? - Yeah.


978
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.240
你要不去招惹吉米·塞拉諾
If you had left Jimmy Serrano alone,


979
01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.680
就沒有這些事了
this wouldn't be happening.


980
01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.080
謝謝
Thank you.


981
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:25.940
我倒有個辦法
I had a way out of this, you know.


982
01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.030
是嗎
Oh, yeah?


983
01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:31.260
塞拉諾最怕什麼
What's the thing Serrano's most afraid of?


984
01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.100
跟你結伴旅行
Goin' cross-country with you.


985
01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:43.180
栽在自己人手裏
Gettin' knocked off by his own people.


986
01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.940
我對他做過的交易瞭如指掌
What I know about his financial transactions


987
01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.100
不僅能扳倒他
would not only put him away,


988
01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:50.520
還能扳倒所有和他有關的黑幫勢力
but every Mob guy he ever did business with.


989
01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.090
所以他才迫不及待要殺我
That's why he wants to kill me.


990
01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:56.060
本來我打算把這些記錄拷到磁碟裏
I was gonna put all his records on computer disks.


991
01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.410
等迫不得已
I figured if things got too rough,


992
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.420
還能用磁碟換條命
I could always trade them for my life.


993
01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:00.560
然後呢
So what happened?


994
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.790
還沒來得及做就被捕了
What happened was I got arrested before I got a chance to do it.


995
01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.270
你為什麼非要跟他死磕
Why didn't you just leave him alone?


996
01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:08.590
你可不像那種
You don't look like the kind of guy


997
01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:10.150
願意找這種麻煩的人
who would be involved in that sort of situation.


998
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:12.870
那你為什麼不拿那個大毒梟的黑錢
Why didn't you just leave that heroin dealer alone?


999
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.320
我可不是什麼黑幫御用會計師
I wasn't some Mob accountant.


1000
01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.440
我以為自己是為一家合法公司工作
I thought I worked in a legitimate firm.


1001
01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.640
當我發現自己工作的地方
When I found out I was managing accounts


1002
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.840
其實是塞拉諾的皮包公司時
that were fronts for Serrano,


1003
01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.840
我可不能無動於衷
I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.


1004
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.080
不過  喬恩  你還是拿了不屬於你的東西
Yeah, but, Jon, you still took what didn't belong to you.


1005
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.170
你怎麼還站在他們那邊
How can you be on the side of a mobster?


1006
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.500
我沒站在他們那邊
I'm not on the side of a mobster.


1007
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.740
你不支持我就是站在他們那邊
You're on his side if you're not on my side.


1008
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:33.950
我和誰都不一邊
I'm not on anybody's side.


1009
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:35.270
跟我沒一點關係
I got nothing to do with it.


1010
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.330
跟你關係大了去了
You got everything to do with this.


1011
01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:38.780
是你要抓我去坐牢  一入獄我就會被殺
You're taking me to jail, and in jail, you know I'll be killed.


1012
01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:43.380
-關我屁事  -關你屁事
- That's not my problem. - It's not your problem?


1013
01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.670
-你在報紙上讀過關於我的報導嗎  -讀過
- Did you read about me in the papers? - Yeah, I did.


1014
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:50.370
-那時候你支持我嗎  -支持
- Were you on my side then? - Yeah, I was.


1015
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:52.780
-為什麼現在不了  -因為你擋我財路了
- Then why aren't you now? - Because now you're in my way.


1016
01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:55.350
擋你財路  當真
I'm in your way? You mean it?


1017
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:57.700
把我送進去有錢賺  你只關心這個
You want the money for turning me in because that's all you're about.


1018
01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.870
你眼裏只有錢
You're just about the fuckin' money.


1019
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:07.850
喬恩  你怎麼想都行
Hey, Jon, you can think whatever you wanna think.


1020
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:09.220
我無所謂
It doesn't matter to me,


1021
01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.910
反正那十萬我是拿定了
because I'm getting my 100,000 any which way you want it.


1022
01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:21.270
走吧
Let's go.


1023
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.330
虛構的牛仔英雄

1024
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.330
托尼  托尼  像不像哈珀龍·卡西迪Hey, Tony. Tony. 
Hopalong Cassidy.

1025
01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:30.860
帶相機了嗎  給我來一張
You got your camera? Take a picture.


1026
01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:32.730
拜託  這是在機場買的
Come on. They got these at the airport.


1027
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:34.170
回去的時候我是不是也該弄一頂
Should I get one on the way back?


1028
01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:37.000
別鬧了  把帽子拿開  好話不說第二遍
Come on. Put that away. I'm not gonna tell you again.


1029
01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.770
托尼  他們來了
Tony, there they are.


1030
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.920
-別來無恙  傑克  -老天
- How you doin', Jack? - Aw, geez.


1031
01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.500
我代吉米向你問好
Jimmy sends you his regards.


1032
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.060
別擔心  我們可不是來找你的
Don't worry, Jack. We're not here for you.


1033
01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:00.860
-找的是他  過來  -好吧
- We're here for him. Get over there. - No problem.


1034
01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:05.050
你瞪什麼呢  有話要說嗎
What are you starin' at? You gonna propose?


1035
01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.830
把槍放下  放下槍  混球們
Drop 'em! I said drop 'em, assholes!


1036
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:20.220
-你們是什麼人  -你他媽又是誰
- Who the fuck are you guys? - Who the fuck are you?


1037
01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.780
你活不長了  知道自己在跟誰作對嗎
You're dead. You know who you're fuckin' with?


1038
01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.110
不  要不你告訴我
No. Why don't you tell me about it?


1039
01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.750
講話記著對著麥克風
Make sure you speak into the microphone.


1040
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:37.120
馬文  馬文

他們殺他幹什麼
Why they wanna kill this guy?


1054

-我受不了了  -你給我閉嘴
- I can't take this anymore. - Shut up a minute.


1059
01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:25.680
艾迪派你來的嗎
Did Eddie put you on this?


1060
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.150
除了他還能有誰
Of course diid he put me on this!


1061
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.690
那個王八蛋  你知道我和他都簽約了嗎
That son of a bitch. You know I have a contract with him?

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:31.540
-簽約了  -是啊  週一簽的
- You got a contract? - Yeah. I signed it on Monday.


1063

他把我從匹茲堡叫來的  說你把這活辦砸了
He called me in Pittsburgh. He said you were fuckin' this thing up.


1064
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:36.090
我  我什麼都沒辦砸
I'm... I'm not fuckin' anything up.


1065
01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:37.720
你兩天前不就該到洛杉磯了嗎
You should've been in L.A. two days ago.


1066
01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.860
馬文  我他媽做事自己有分寸
Marvin, don't tell me how to do my goddamn job.


1067
01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.240
我都在考慮要不要放了他
I'm half-thinkin' not to turn him in


1068
01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.010
讓艾迪自生自滅得了
just to watch Eddie go down the fuckin' toilet.


1069
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:46.100
-這主意不錯  -誰跟你說話了
- See, that's a good thought. - What? Who the hell's talkin' to you?

是啊  誰他媽和你說話了
Yeah. Who the fuck's talkin' to you?


1071

他也輪不到你來送了  傻逼  他是我的了
He's not yours to take anymore, whip-dick. He's mine.


1072
01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.270
你們聽到了嗎
Do you hear that?


1073

你倆真是我見過的最蠢的賞金獵人了
You guys are the dumbest bounty hunters I've ever seen!


1077
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:18.420
你們連牛奶都送不了
You couldn't even deliver a bottle of milk!


1078
01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:25.360
你他媽閉嘴行嗎
Will you shut the fuck up?


1079

他們哪兒去了
Where the hell did it go?

甩掉他們了嗎
You think we lost him?


1081
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.520
不知道  我看不見
I don't know. I don't see anything.


1082
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:41.010
肯定脫離危險了呢
I'm sure we're completely safe.

01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:34.750
反正不是衝我來的
They're not after me.


1089

開個玩笑  開個玩笑

我以為你把鑰匙丟了
I thought you threw those away.


1091

看問題要仔細  馬文  我丟的是車鑰匙
Always check the evidence. Marvin. Those were car keys.

會讓我不爽嗎
Is this gonna upset me?


1126
01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:48.560
應該會
I think it's safe to say that.


1127
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:51.920
你吃過一道菜嗎
Are you familiar with a dish...


1128
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:55.010
用土豆做的...里昂土豆
a potato dish... lyonnaise potatoes?


1129
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.330
是一種炸土豆
It's a kind of fried potato,


1130
01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:00.890
不過加了洋蔥

1131
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:02.520
特別美味
It's quite delicious.

我身上帶夠了買里昂那土豆的錢
You know, I have enough money to buy as much lyonnaise potatoes...

1137
01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:23.020
我只是覺得
I just...


1138
01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:26.730
你應該考慮一下  因為
I think you oughta think about it a little bit, because...


1139
01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:29.040
等等  等等
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

把手銬擋上
Cover it up.


1142
01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.900
勞駕  能載我們到鎮上嗎
Hey. You think you could give us a ride to the next town?

Great, great. See? For every shit, there's six nice people.

It's "Hello." I can say "Hello" in a lot of different languages.


1147
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:57.950
雖然跟你沒法溝通
Not yours, but a lot of them.


1148
01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:04.770
歡迎光臨  先生
Welcome, sir.


1149

- I'm not lookin' forward to this. - You think I am?


1150
01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.680
你倆是有多無能
I don't understand the problem with you two.


1151
01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:15.900
他他媽就是個會計
The guy's a fuckin' accountant.


1152
01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.570
吉米  我們運氣實在不好
Jimmy, it's been bad luck right down the line.


1153
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:18.800
而且那個沃爾什也不好對付
Plus, this guy Walsh is pretty good.


1154
01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.690
他真那麼厲害嗎  托尼
If he's that good, Tony,


1155
01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:21.410
我該雇他來殺了你們
maybe I should hire him to hit you.


1156
01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:23.740
希望條子不會反查到吉米身上
I hope there's no chance of any of this comin' back to Jimmy.


1157
01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.120
不可能  直升機是從堪薩斯租來的
No chance. We rented the chopper out of Kansas City.


1158
01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.480
和你八竿子打不著
It's five times removed from you,


1159
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.060
你絕對沒事  別擔心
so you're clear of this. Don't worry.


1160
01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.370
沒事個屁  你個傻逼
Clear as shit, you fuckin' moron!


1161
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:32.270
那傢伙還活得好好的  不是嗎
The guy's still out there, ain't he?


1162
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:33.860
你倆聽好了
Let me tell you two guys somethin'.


1163
01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:36.540
這次要再殺不掉那個會計
I'm not interested in seeing either one of you two alive again


1164
01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:39.110
就甭想活著見我了  懂嗎
until you get the accountant. You got the message?


1165
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.490
-下車吧  -就到這嗎
- It's the end of the ride. - This is it?

這也好意思叫鎮子
What the hell kind of town is this?


1172
01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.780
你們中有誰能載我們到錢寧嗎
Is there someone that could give us a ride to Channing?


1173
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:38.480
-有人要往那個方向去嗎  -不  沒人去
- Is there anyone going in that direction? - No. No have a ride.

You're a goddamn pilot, you son of a bitch?


1187
01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.580
我覺得這事告訴你不太好  傑克
I didn't feel it was appropriate to share that with you, Jack.


1188
01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.680
揍你一頓好不好  他媽的
I'm gonna fuckin' "appropriate" your head, goddamn it!

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:23.860
傑克  咱們捋捋清楚  是你先騙我的
Jack, let's be fair about this. You lied to me first.

01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:24.770
-在  在河邊  -什麼

- At the river... - You lied to...


1215
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:31.410
你先騙我的  騙起人來眼都不眨
You lied to me first. You got some fuckin' nerve.


1216
01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:33.490
不  你先騙我的
No. You lied to me first!

你先騙我的

Yes. Yes, I lied to you first,


1219
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:43.180

but you had no knowledge I was lying about my fear of flying


1220
01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.310
我說我有恐飛癥是騙你的
at the river when you lied to me.


1221
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:48.860
所以站在你的角度  還是你先騙我的
So as far as you knew, you lied to me first.


1222
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:50.660
懶得和你爭
I can't even argue with you.


1223
01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.410
我他媽都聽不懂你在說什麼了
I don't even know what the fuck you're talkin' about.


1224
01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:55.190
就是在你不知情的前提下  是你先騙了我
I'm just saying you lied to me first as far as you knew.


1225
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:57.640
-天哪  -怎麼了

-胃潰瘍犯了  -胃潰瘍

Yeah, I got an ulcer. I got a big fuckin' ulcer.


1228
01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.480
托你的福又開始流血了
All your bullshit's starting to make it bleed again.


1229
01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.930
知道自己為什麼會得胃潰瘍嗎
You know why you have an ulcer?


1230
01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:06.760
因為你就只會兩種表達方式
'Cause you have two forms of expression:


1231
01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.070
沉默和憤怒

你應該喝點牛奶緩解一下
You should get some milk to coat it.


1233
01:19:15.170 --> 01:19:16.310
不用你多事
Don't tell me what I need.


1234
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:18.310
吃點東西就好了
I need something to eat, that's what I need.


1235

What are we gonna buy it with? Dirt?


1236
01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:23.560

你要敢耍花樣
You fuck with me...


1250

你個王八蛋
You son of a bitch!


1305

不要激動
Don't overreact now.


1309
01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:23.950
"不要激動"  老子才不激動  給老子過來
"Don't overreact." I won't overreact! Get over here!

傑克  這不是個好
Jack, it's a bad...


1312
01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.410
把手放那兒  手放那兒
Put your hand in there! Put your hand in there!


1313
01:24:31.410 --> 01:24:34.020
-好吧  好吧   -淡定  傑克  淡定
- All right. All right. - Easy, Jack. Easy, easy.

There, you son of a bitch!


1315
01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:40.850
傑克
Jack?


1316
01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:43.770
給老子閉嘴  我他媽一句話也不想和你說了
You shut up! I'm not talkin' to you for the whole rest of this trip!


1317
01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:49.440
你們還準不準備放我了
Are you guys gonna let me go or what?


1318
01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:51.090
我說了我什麼都不知道
I'm tellin' you, I don't know anything.

Is that a fact?


1320
01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.720
該死
Oh, shit.


1321
01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:05.170
你還是戒煙吧  也能給我省點錢
Why don't you quit? It'd be cheaper for both of us.


1322
01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.640
他們在哪兒
Where are they?


1323
01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:15.120
問倒我了
You got me.


1324
01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.740
-警探...  -閉嘴
- Inspector... - Shut up.


1325
01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:21.730
聽著  混蛋  我現在就要答案
Now, you listen, you son of a bitch. I want answers right now.


1326
01:25:21.730 --> 01:25:23.780
什麼答案  我什麼都不知道啊
What do you want from me? I don't know nothin'.


1327
01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:29.620
長官
Sir,


1328
01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:34.150
有人報案說阿朗佐·莫斯利特工
it seems that an Agent Alonzo Mosely


1329
01:25:34.190 --> 01:25:35.440
與其搭檔在錢寧附近跳上一列
and his partner were seen


1330
01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:38.090
西行的貨運列車
hopping a westbound freight train near Channing.


1331
01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:42.620
走吧
Come on.


1332
01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:01.170
傑克  "幹什麼"
Jack? "What?"


1333
01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.070
我們還得坐多遠
How much further do you think we have to go?


1334
01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.650
"關你屁事"
"None of your fuckin' business."


1335
01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:09.120
不是  因為  那個
No. Because, you know,


1336
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.670
我總得上個廁所吧
eventually I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.


1337
01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:12.040
"把嘴閉上"
"Shut the fuck up. "


1338
01:26:18.670 --> 01:26:20.960
你和動物搞過嗎  傑克
Did you ever have sex with an animal, Jack?


1339
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.160
記得印第安保留區的那些雞嗎
Remember those chickens around Indian reservation?


1340
01:26:27.710 --> 01:26:29.600
說實話  長得還挺好看  傑克
There were some good-looking chickens. Jack.


1341
01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.890
就跟你說說
You know, between us.


1342
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:34.340
是啊  我看有幾隻我還挺有戲的
Yeah. There were a couple there I might've taken a shot at.


1343
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:39.980
你和那塊表到底有什麼故事
What's with you and that watch?


1344
01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:41.110
這表到底是什麼來歷
What is it with the watch?


1345
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:42.900
你說等你更瞭解我了就告訴我
You told me when you get to know me better.


1346
01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:45.240
你都說了雞的事了
You told me about your feelings for chickens.


1347
01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.180
表的故事能有多隱私呢
How private could the watch be?


1348
01:26:47.190 --> 01:26:48.820
到底是什麼大秘密
What's the big secret?


1349
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:55.670
這表是蓋爾買來送我的
Gail bought me this watch. She gave it to me.


1350
01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:57.530
是她送我的第一個禮物
It was the first thing she ever gave me.


1351
01:27:01.630 --> 01:27:06.050
她送我這塊表  因為我經常遲到
She... She bought it because I was always late,


1352
01:27:06.810 --> 01:27:07.990
每次都有半個小時吧
at least a half an hour or so.


1353
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:10.520
她把表調快了半小時
She bought it and set it ahead a half an hour


1354
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:11.960
這樣我就不會遲到了
so I'd never be late.


1355
01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:22.750
我內心深處
Somewhere in the back of my mind,


1356
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:24.650
總覺得我們有一天能重修舊好
I keep thinkin' we're gonna wind up together again.


1357
01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:26.450
我也不懂自己還堅持什麼
I don't know why I'm still hangin' on,


1358
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:27.910
還在等什麼
I'm still waitin' around.


1359
01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.340
她不會回來了
I don't think she's comin' back.


1360
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:41.470
是啊  我也這麼想  我也這麼想
Yeah. I don't either. I don't either.


1361
01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:46.050
有時你得學會放手
Sometimes you just have to let go.


1362
01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:51.250
買塊新表吧
Just get yourself a new watch.


1363
01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:00.100
你人不錯  傑克
You're okay, Jack.


1364
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:07.540
咱倆就算不這麼相遇
I think, under different circumstances,


1365
01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:13.560
可能也會恨對方
you and I probably still would've hated each other.


1366
01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.690
也沒準能做朋友
Yeah. We probably could've been friends.


1367
01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.460
下輩子吧
In the next life.


1368
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:27.400
是啊  下輩子吧
Yeah, the next life.


1369
01:28:33.450 --> 01:28:36.560
真棒  你們這兒食宿條件真不錯
Yeah. Great. The accommodations were wonderful.


1370
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:40.860
-有煙嗎  -不抽
- You got a smoke? - Don't smoke.


1371
01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:45.270
-那個聯調局的拿了我的煙  -想拿回你的煙
- That fed took my cigarettes. - You want your cigarettes back?


1372
01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:48.110
那你得去弗拉格斯塔夫了
Then you're gonna have to go to Flagstaff to get 'em,


1373
01:28:48.150 --> 01:28:50.080
莫斯利那傢伙也去了那兒
'cause that's where your pal Mosely went.


1374
01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:55.210
我沒準真會去呢
Just might do that.


1375
01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:03.090
咱們到哪兒了
Where do you figure we are?


1376
01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.250
差不多該到亞利桑那了
My guess would be Arizona.


1377
01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:08.390
整夜西行  應該快到家了
We've been goin' west all night. I think we're almost home.


1378
01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.930
我也離死不遠了
I'm almost dead.


1379
01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:23.780
喬恩  證人保護計劃也沒那麼糟糕
Look, Jon. You know, the witness protection program isn't so bad.


1380
01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.980
他們會給你新的身份  新的生活
They'll give you a new name. You'll have a new life.


1381
01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:29.500
我可活不到什麼證人保護計劃
I'm not gonna make it to any witness protection program.


1382
01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.840
-誰知道呢  喬恩  -你心知肚明
- You don't know that, Jon. - I know that and you know that.


1383
01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.630
等不到我申請到證人保護
Serrano's going to get to me before I get to


1384
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:35.510
塞拉諾就能殺了我
any witness protection program.


1385
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.200
行行好  別假裝在乎我了
Do me a favor. Don't pretend you care about me.


1386
01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.760
簡直是侮辱我的智商
It really insults my intelligence.


1387
01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:42.620
咱倆都面對現實吧
I mean, let's face it.


1388
01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:46.300
我對你唯一的用處  就是賺錢
The only important thing about me to you, is gettin' your money.


1389
01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:49.680
你能不能別老把我看成一個
I'm tired of you makin' me out to be some kind of thug


1390
01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:52.130
滿腦子銅臭的大老粗
whose only concern is a big chunk of change.


1391
01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:53.300
你知不知道塞拉諾的手下
Did you know that Serrano's people


1392
01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:54.920
出價一百萬讓我把你交出去
offered me a million bucks for you?


1393
01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.160
你還不如答應他們呢
Why don't you go over to big money?


1394
01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.550
反正我最後還是得落到他手裏
You're doin' his work for him anyway.


1395
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:58.960
落到他手裏
I'm working for him anyway?


1396
01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.950
你他媽什麼也不明白
You don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about.


1397
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:02.670
我接這活最根本的原因
The reason I do this shit in the first place


1398
01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:05.000
就是不想幫那個人渣做事
is 'cause I wouldn't work for that lowlife asshole.


1399
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.240
什麼意思
What does that mean?


1400
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:10.980
沒什麼  不重要
Nothin'. Doesn't mean anything.


1401
01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:19.560
塞拉諾是你口中的芝加哥大毒梟
Serrano is the heroin dealer you told me about in Chicago?


1402
01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:26.120
買通你同事  毀了你生活的就是塞拉諾
Who owned your buddies and destroyed your life? That's Serrano?


1403
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:31.220
那你還打算把我送進監獄
That's the guy that you're takin' me in...


1404
01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:33.970
好讓他來殺了我
That's the guy that's gonna kill me?


1405
01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.290
希望那家咖啡館真的物有所值  傑克
I hope it's a wonderful coffee shop, Jack.


1406
01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:02.400
-走吧  該下車了  -幹什麼  什麼
- Come on. We're gettin' off. - What? What? What?


1407
01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:05.540
-該走了  火車男  來吧  -不
- We are getting off here, Mr. Railroad Man. Come on. - No.


1408
01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:10.520
拜託  你瘋了嗎  拜託  先商量下行嗎
Come on! What are you talking about? Come on! Let's discuss this!


1409
01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.030
-找到了嗎  -還沒
- You find anything? - Not yet.


1410
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:26.190
他們可能在沿線任何地方跳車
They could've jumped off the train anywhere along the line.


1411
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:37.200
火車沿線會有一個個車站
Trains have regularly scheduled stops.


1412
01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.470
設置車站就是為了
The reason for that is you know,


1413
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:41.560
讓人們在停車時能夠安全下車
because people plan to get off the trains when they stop,


1414
01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.400
所以正常人都會在車站下車
and that's how, generally, people do it.


1415
01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:46.580
而不是在列車行駛時把別人扔下去
They don't throw each other off the trains.


1416
01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:50.190
所以才有車站
That's the purpose of having stops.


1417
01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:54.320
這是要幹什麼  你要幹什麼  你又幹什麼
What's this? What are you gonna do? What are you doing now?


1418
01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.950
你要幹什麼  你要幹什麼
What are you doing? What are you doing?


1419
01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.270
天哪  天哪  拜託  你開玩笑的吧
Oh, Christ. Christ. Come on. Come on. You kidding?


1420
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.720
我們會被打成馬蜂窩的  老天爺
They're gonna come out and shoot us, for Chrissake!


1421
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:13.630
搞什麼  搞什麼
What the hell. What the hell.


1422
01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:17.040
老天  這下好了
Jesus. Oh, great.


1423
01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:21.890
你負責發動車子
You get it started,


1424
01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:25.560
我把你撞飛
and I'll run you over.


1425
01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.700
這是我能想到的最好的主意了
That's the best plan I can think of.


1426
01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.780
恭喜  恭喜
Congratulations. Congratulations.


1427
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:34.780
-又多了一條罪名  -走吧
- Another crime. - Come on.


1428
01:32:37.890 --> 01:32:40.460
我很反感  很反感所有你做的事
I don't like this. I don't like anything you do,


1429
01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:42.310
實話告訴你  沒一件喜歡的
to tell you the truth. Nothin'.


1430
01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.770
-我們去哪兒  -最近的機場
- Where are we going? - To the nearest airport.


1431
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:07.570
我都懶得當事後諸葛亮了
I'm not the kind of guy that says, "I told you so."


1432
01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:12.750
糟糕
Oh, shit!


1433
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:16.320
他們在這裏以南三十五英里的
Looks like they've been spotted


1434
01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:18.780
塞多那附近被發現
around 35 miles south of here, near Sedona.


1435
01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:20.760
已經有警官在進行追捕
There are officers in pursuit.


1436
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:22.650
我們坐直升機走
Let's take the chopper.


1437
01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.170
這  這  看這樣子
This is... This is... This is the kind of situation


1438
01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:38.900
咱們要糟
where something bad happens.


1439
01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.470
慢點
Easy!


1440
01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.470
該死  我討厭這樣
Goddamn it! I don't like this!


1441
01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:09.900
卡車  卡車
Truck! Truck!


1442
01:34:48.810 --> 01:34:51.570
-你要去哪兒  傑克  -到了就知道了
- Where you going, Jack? - You'll find out when we get there.


1443
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:08.580
我陷得太深  太深
I've come too far. Too far.


1444
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:11.590
離終點又如此的近
Come too close.


1445
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:09.510
好了  我來了  好了
Okay. I'm coming. All right.


1446
01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.200
-走吧  -好吧
- Come on. - Right.


1447
01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:28.360
運氣不錯  你好
Here we go. Hello.


1448
01:36:28.450 --> 01:36:29.770
你好
Hello.


1449
01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:35.490
是我走運了還是我太厲害了
Am I lucky, or am I just good?


1450
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:40.380
-那是馬文嗎  -那還用說  老子當然是最棒的
- Is that Marvin? - Fuckin' "A". I'm the best.


1451
01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:44.960
-馬文  -你好啊  傑克  你個傻逼
- Marvin? - Hello, Jack, you dumb shit.


1452
01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.680
老天
Jesus!


1453
01:36:53.130 --> 01:36:56.710
-過來  你個王八蛋  -等等  等等
- Come on, you fuckin' pain in the ass. - Hold on. Wait a minute.


1454
01:36:59.390 --> 01:37:01.650
敢動一下撕了你
If you move, I'll tear your fuckin' lungs out.


1455
01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:06.060
洛杉磯見  傑克
See you in L.A., Jack.


1456
01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.050
媽的
Shit.


1457
01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:53.570
-下午好  先生  -下午好
- Afternoon, sir. - Afternoon.


1458
01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:58.050
-還開業嗎  -我們全天營業
- You're open? - Oh, we're always open.


1459
01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:02.530
今天挺難熬的
Hard day, huh?


1460
01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:06.600
-這一周都糟透了  -看得出來
- Hard week. - Yeah, I know what you mean.


1461
01:38:08.290 --> 01:38:09.530
給我來杯咖啡吧
I could use a cup of coffee.


1462
01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:12.330
好的  先生
Yes, sir.


1463
01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.590
-謝謝  -不客氣
- Thanks. - You welcome.


1464
01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:33.260
拿著吧
Keep 'em.


1465
01:38:47.850 --> 01:38:51.050
天哪  我找了好久
Gee. I've been lookin' all over for these.


1466
01:38:51.980 --> 01:38:53.220
謝了  阿朗佐
Thanks, Alonzo.


1467
01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:00.860
馬文  我得提醒你一下
Marvin, I have to tell you,


1468
01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:03.750
我患有嚴重的恐飛癥
I have this very serious fear of flying.


1469
01:39:03.810 --> 01:39:07.800
是嗎  那就放輕鬆  睡過去吧
Yeah? Well, why don't you just relax and sleep through it.


1470
01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:12.830
忘了截止日期吧  沃爾什
Forget your deadline, Walsh.


1471
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:14.630
這個案子對你來說已經結束了
It's over. That's the way that one went.


1472
01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:17.250
我知道我有什麼權利  我要打電話
I know my rights. You owe me phone calls.


1473
01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:19.410
現在你的當務之急可不是
What should be of paramount importance to you right now


1474
01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:20.450
打電話
is not the phone calls.


1475
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:21.170
是你因為假扮特工
It's the fact that you're gonna


1476
01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:23.590
要去坐的那十年牢
spend 10 years for impersonating a federal agent.


1477
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:25.580
-假扮特工要判十年嗎  -十年
- Ten years for impersonating a fed, huh? - Ten years.


1478
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:27.970
十年  那怎麼沒人來抓你呢
Ten years. How come no one's after you?


1479
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:40.780
-讓他打電話  -謝了
- Give this guy his calls. - Thanks.


1480
01:39:42.650 --> 01:39:44.150
能給我點私人空間嗎
Can I have a little privacy, please?


1481
01:39:57.190 --> 01:39:58.710
莫斯康保釋代理
Mascone Bail Bonds.


1482

你最好告訴我些好消息
Yeah. This better be good news,

fuckin' Jack, because you got five hours left.

No,it's not, Eddie. I'm calling to let you know

等等  等等
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.


1488
01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.590
我的活你敢讓馬文來摻合  王八蛋
You put Marvin on this case, you fuckin' piece of shit?


1489
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:19.480
-你個殺千刀的騙子  人渣  -罵夠沒
- You fucking, deceptive... You vermin! - You fuckin' done yet?


1490
01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:22.790
-你他媽就是屎裏的蛆  -是你搞砸了  好嗎
- You slimeball in a sea of pus! What? - You blew it, all right?


1491
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:27.720
你抓到那傢伙都他媽四天了  傑克  四天了
You had the guy four fuckin' days, Jack. Four days!


1492
01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:28.850
你他媽
You could've fuckin'...


1493
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:31.500
就他媽倒著走也走回來了吧
You could've walked him backwards and not fuckin' blown it.


1494
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:32.420
就這樣你都搞砸了
But you blow it!


1495
01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:36.770
我他媽以前做事讓你失望過嗎  你個小人
When have I ever... When have I ever let you down, you fuckin' rat?


1496
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:40.530
你瘋了嗎  跑去告訴道夫勒我付你十萬
Are you fuckin' nuts, tellin' Dorfler I offered you $100,000,


1497
01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:42.300
我跟他說只給他兩萬五
when I told him I'd give him 25,000?


1498
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:44.000
等等  等一下
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.


1499
01:40:44.010 --> 01:40:45.680
-你什麼時候和他聯繫過  -重要嗎
- When did you speak to him? - What's the difference?


1500
01:40:45.690 --> 01:40:46.670
你什麼時候和馬文聯繫過
When did you speak to Marvin?


1501
01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.980
大概  十分鐘之前
He called me fuckin', what, 10 minutes ago,


1502
01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:51.730
也是大吼大叫  讓我滾他媽的蛋
yellin' and screamin', tellin' me to go fuck myself.


1503
01:40:51.730 --> 01:40:54.150
你也跟我說  怎麼誰都讓我滾他媽的蛋
You're tellin' me... Everybody's tellin' me to go fuck myself!


1504
01:40:54.150 --> 01:40:56.170
-什麼  -我他媽長得像足球嗎
- What? - Am I supposed to just sit on my fuckin' butt?


1505
01:40:56.170 --> 01:40:57.700
艾迪  艾迪  艾迪  艾迪
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.


1506
01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:00.610
-你他媽說什麼呢  -你還剩五個小時
- What are you fuckin' talkin' about? - Look, you got five hours left.


1507
01:41:00.610 --> 01:41:02.950
能把"公爵"帶回來嗎  給個准話
Can you bring the fuckin' Duke in, yes or no?


1508
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:04.730
不是在他手上嗎
I thought he's bringing him to you.


1509
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:06.280
我剛和道夫勒通過電話
I just talked to fuckin' Dorfler.


1510
01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:08.500
-"公爵"不在他手上  -什麼
- He don't have the Duke. - What?


1511
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:12.780
-該死的"公爵"在哪兒  人呢  -再聯絡
- Where's the fuckin' Duke? Hello? - I'll talk to you later.


1512
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:14.390
傑克
Jack?


1513
01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:37.460
托尼·達爾沃

1514
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:50.870
-你好  -我找托尼·達爾沃
- Hello? - Is Tony Darvo there, please?


1515
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:53.230
-你是誰  -馬文·道夫勒
- Who's calling? - Marvin Dorfler.


1516
01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:59.410
馬文·道夫勒打電話來了
Yo. I got Marvin Dorfler on the line.


1517
01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:02.040
-要幫你接通嗎  -好  好  接過來
- Shall I put him through? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put him through.


1518
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:06.010
馬文  一切還在按計劃進行嗎  夥計
Marvin, everything's still on schedule, pal, isn't it?


1519
01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:09.060
-原來道夫勒改給你們賣命了  -你是誰
- So Dorfler's working for you guys? - Who is this?


1520
01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.880
-傑克·沃爾什  -傑克  你在抱怨什麼呢
- This is Jack Walsh. - Jack. What are you complainin' for?


1521
01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.530
我們先找的你  不是嗎  是傑克·沃爾什
We came to you first, didn't we? It's Jack Walsh.


1522
01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:17.450
等一下  有人想給你問個好
Hold on. Somebody wants to say hello.


1523
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:21.940
過期不候了  傻逼
Hey. Too late for you, scumbag.


1524
01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:23.250
不  不  這話應該我說
No, no. Too late for you.


1525
01:42:23.250 --> 01:42:24.930
我沒拿到錢可不會善罷甘休
I didn't come this far not to collect my money,


1526
01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:26.670
聽明白了嗎  王八蛋
you understand me, you motherfuckers.


1527
01:42:26.670 --> 01:42:29.370
-我是來要人的  -跟我說幹什麼
- I want the Duke back. - So what the fuck you tellin' me for?


1528
01:42:29.370 --> 01:42:32.330
跟你說幹什麼  跟你說幹什麼
What am I tellin' you for? What am I tellin' you for?


1529
01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.550
我  我告訴你跟你說幹什麼
What am I... I'll tell you what I'm tellin' you for.


1530
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:36.860
就因為我這有一些"公爵"的東西
I got some of the Duke's belongings, that's why,


1531
01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:38.540
包括電腦磁碟什麼的
including some computer disks


1532
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:40.990
記錄了塞拉諾非法交易
that have every last detail of Serrano's businesses


1533
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:43.710
和洗錢流程的每一筆賬  應有盡有
and his money-laundering operations. Everything.


1534
01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:46.840
兩小時內不把"公爵"還給我
If I don't get the Duke back in two hours,


1535
01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:49.040
我就把磁碟交給調查局的人
I'm gonna turn those disks over to the feds.


1536
01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.470
聽到沒  告訴塞拉諾兩小時內
Do you hear me? You tell Serrano I wanna meet him


1537
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:52.970
帶著"公爵"到
with the Duke, alone, in two hours


1538
01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:54.580
麥卡倫機場的主航站樓
in the main terminal at McCarran Airport


1539
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:55.700
在那做交易
where we'll make the exchange.


1540
01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:57.080
你們那群傻逼裏面
I know he's the only one of you idiots


1541
01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.920
就他不敢在公共場合對我動手
who won't try to take a shot at me in public place.


1542
01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:00.990
我看到他一個手下
And if I see one fuckin' single goon


1543
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:02.510
出現在機場周圍
within a mile of that airport,


1544
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:04.350
聽清楚了
and listen to me very carefully,


1545
01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:06.520
交易立馬取消  我直接去找條子
the deal is off, and I'm going to the feds.


1546
01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:08.750
我不會跟吉米說你的這些瞎話
I ain't gonna bother Jimmy with your bullshit.


1547
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:10.900
是嗎  那敢情好  你可千萬別說
Oh, yeah? You're not? Ok, fine, fine.


1548
01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:11.690
等他被捕了
After he's busted,


1549
01:43:11.690 --> 01:43:14.370
我一定第一時間讓他知道我告訴過你
I'll make sure to let him know you knew all about it beforehand.


1550
01:43:14.490 --> 01:43:17.880
兩小時內  麥卡倫機場的主航站樓
That's two hours from now, main terminal, McCarran Airport.


1551
01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:20.180
聽清了嗎  蠢貨  祝你愉快
You got that, moron? Have a nice day.


1552
01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:28.970
跟阿朗佐說我想做個交易
Tell Alonzo I wanna make a deal.


1553
01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.490
你想和我做交易
You wanna make a deal with me?


1554
01:43:45.570 --> 01:43:47.650
把塞拉諾交給你怎麼樣
What would you do if I could deliver you Serrano?


1555
01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:51.350
怎麼個交法
What do you mean "deliver"?


1556
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:54.190
至少可以控告他企圖銷毀政府證物
For starters, conspiracy to destroy government evidence.


1557
01:43:54.210 --> 01:43:55.730
什麼政府證物
What government evidence?


1558
01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:58.370
能讓我親自帶"公爵"回去拿錢嗎
Will you let me take the Duke back myself and collect my money?


1559
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.170
-說詳細點  -路上說
- Tell me more. - I'll have to tell you on the way.


1560
01:44:10.170 --> 01:44:12.380
咱們得在兩小時內到拉斯維加斯
Because we gotta be in Las Vegas in two hours.


1561
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:20.230
藍天使汽車旅館
有空房


1562
01:44:29.770 --> 01:44:30.920
馬文
Marvin?


1563
01:44:32.490 --> 01:44:35.060
-馬文  -不  客房服務
- Marvin? - No. It's room service.


1564
01:44:46.190 --> 01:44:49.810
拿著這個  這樣就知道是今天拍的了
Here. Hold this up so they know I took this today.


1565
01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:53.840
是不是很聰明  我的大腦總是運轉如飛
I amaze myself. I'm always thinkin'.


1566
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:56.920
沒有我解決不了的問題
Got it all figured out.


1567
01:44:57.630 --> 01:45:00.590
-說"茄子"  -別這麼做  馬文
- Now, say "Cheese". - Don't do this, Marvin.


1568
01:45:03.370 --> 01:45:04.550
再見
Adios.


1569
01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:11.470
-根本沒有什麼電腦磁碟  對嗎  -對
- There are no real computer disks. Is that right? - Right.


1570
01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:14.610
他動手接了你手裏的空磁碟
So if you give him blank disks and he accepts them,


1571
01:45:14.610 --> 01:45:17.090
才構成犯罪嗎
would that be considered an overt act?


1572
01:45:17.190 --> 01:45:19.190
只要他踏入機場
If he just sets foot inside the airport,


1573
01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.450
就已經構成犯罪條件了
he's committed an overt act.


1574
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:22.460
這叫企圖妨礙司法公正
Conspiracy to obstructjustice.


1575
01:45:22.570 --> 01:45:24.730
他要和"公爵"一起出現  你還能告他綁架
When he shows up with the Duke, you add kidnapping.


1576
01:45:24.730 --> 01:45:27.180
他的人如果帶了槍  就告他謀殺
Anybody packing a gun, conspiracy to commit murder.


1577
01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:28.270
因為是在機場
The fact that it's an airport...


1578
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:29.790
阿朗佐  我說錯你就指出來
Alonzo, correct me if you think I'm wrong,


1579
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:31.390
我不是搶你生意
I don't want to step on your toes,


1580
01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:34.140
哪怕是現在  他都算是跨州窩藏逃犯
you can slap an interstate transportation, aid of racketeering rap


1581
01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:35.710
還有協助敲詐罪
on him right away as well.


1582
01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.990
如果你不能讓他拿走磁碟
None of that bullshit means anything


1583
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:40.890
剛才這一堆都是白扯
unless you can get him to take those disks from you.


1584
01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:43.290
別擔心  我會讓他拿到磁碟的
Don't worry. I'll get him to take the disks.


1585
01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:45.630
在他身上裝個竊聽器
Get a wire on this man.


1586
01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:57.110
馬文
Marvin.


1587
01:45:59.650 --> 01:46:03.080
阿馬裏洛那點小誤會希望你們別介意
Hey, no hard feelings about what happened back in Amarillo, huh?


1588
01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:10.560
那時候是形勢所迫
It's just one of those spur-of-the-moment deals, you know?


1589
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:13.570
-他在哪兒  -錢在哪兒
- Where is he? - Where's the money?


1590
01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:15.520
車裏  他在哪兒
In the car. Where is he?


1591
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:22.500
我改主意了  現在要兩百萬了
Slight change of plans. Now I want two million.


1592
01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.090
-什麼  -我回去讀了報紙
- What? - Hey. I read the newspapers, you know?


1593
01:46:25.090 --> 01:46:27.170
這傢伙拿了你們一千五百萬  是嗎
The guy got you for 15 million, right?


1594
01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:29.110
我想他至少值兩百萬
So I figure the guy's gotta be worth at least two.


1595
01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.440
我是個生意人
I'm a businessman.


1596
01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:35.920
我們怎麼知道他在你手裏
How do we know you got him?


1597
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:47.960
現在給我一百萬  二十分鐘後給你電話
I want one million now, and I'll call you in 20 minutes,


1598
01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.530
告訴你另外一百萬放哪兒
tell you where to drop off the second million.


1599
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:56.310
我拿到錢就告訴你們他在哪兒  行不
Once I know it's there, then I'll tell you where he is. Okay?


1600
01:46:58.250 --> 01:47:00.100
-不行  -為什麼
- Not okay. - Why not?


1601
01:47:05.890 --> 01:47:07.580
你瘋了嗎  怎麼跟吉米交代
What? Are you fuckin' nuts? What's Jimmy gonna say?


1602
01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:09.440
現在我們他媽上哪兒找"公爵"去
How the fuck are we gonna get the Duke now?


1603
01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:10.760
答案就在你手裏
You got the answer right in your hand.


1604
01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:11.980
什麼意思
What are you talkin' about?


1605
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:15.290
那張照片  喬伊  你什麼時候能動動腦
The paper. Joey, when are you gonna learn how to pay attention?


1606
01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:18.000
藍天使汽車旅館

1607
01:47:16.110 --> 01:47:18.060
看見寫的什麼了嗎
Look. See what it says there?


1608
01:47:23.290 --> 01:47:25.020
好了  就這樣
All right. This is it.


1609
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:27.270
今晚要了結一切  明白嗎
Tonight is the fuckin' night, you understand?


1610
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:29.190
我受不了那些廢物了
I'm sick of all of these screwups.


1611
01:47:29.190 --> 01:47:31.710
一旦我搶到那些磁碟
As soon as I get the disks from Walsh,


1612
01:47:31.710 --> 01:47:34.280
立馬殺了沃爾什和"公爵"
you guys drop Walsh and you drop the Duke.


1613
01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.190
明白嗎  一拿到磁碟就動手
Do you understand? I get the disks, you drop them. Okay?


1614
01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:41.060
-我不建議你這麼做  -是嗎
- I don't think you should do this. - Oh, really?


1615
01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:43.070
那你說我該怎麼辦
What do you propose that I do?


1616
01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:45.910
派人送錢給他  而不是殺了他
Send somebody with cash offer, but don't do this.


1617
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:48.220
我瞭解沃爾什  他才不會收我的錢
I know Walsh. He won't take any money from me.


1618
01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:51.390
他正義感特別強烈  所以我才煩他
He's a very self-righteous type of guy, it aggravates me.


1619
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:52.650
在他心裏  這才叫兩不相干
In his mind, this is clean.


1620
01:47:52.650 --> 01:47:54.880
我走我的陽關道  他過他的獨木橋
He gets what he wants; I get what I want.


1621
01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:57.450
-這傢伙腦子燒壞了  希德尼  -吉米  聽我說
- The guy's a fuckin' burnout, Sidney. - Hey, Jimmy, listen.


1622
01:47:57.450 --> 01:47:59.700
希德尼  坐下  放鬆  吃個三明治
Sidney. Sit down. Relax. Have a sandwich.


1623
01:47:59.700 --> 01:48:01.920
喝杯牛奶  別煩我就行
Drink a glass of milk. Do some fuckin' thing.


1624
01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:20.870
他出發了
He's on his way.


1625
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:37.210
他在拉斯維加斯大道上向北行駛
He's heading north on Las Vegas Boulevard,


1626
01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:39.200
離機場約有兩英里
approximately two miles from the airport.


1627
01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.560
-繼續跟蹤  -你笑什麼
- We're right on him. - Why are you smilin'?


1628
01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.450
找回了點當警察的感覺
I feel like a cop again.


1629
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:40.700
大人物終於肯露面了呀
So, I'm finally in the presence of greatness, huh?


1630
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:42.550
"公爵"
The Duke.


1631
01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.720
從罪大惡極的人渣手裏偷了錢
The guy that steals money from the scum of the earth


1632
01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:48.140
去救濟窮苦大眾的大盜
and gives it to the unfortunates of the world.


1633
01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:50.540
早就想和你面對面聊聊了
I wanted to meet you face-to-face.


1634
01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.760
你真以為拿了我的錢
Did you actually think that you were gonna steal my money


1635
01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.640
還能一走了之嗎
and get away with it?


1636
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:06.270
告訴你兩件事
I stopped by here to tell you two things.


1637
01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:09.500
第一  今晚就是你的死期
Number one is that you're gonna die tonight.


1638
01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:13.390
第二  我會回到家
Number two, I'm gonna go home,


1639
01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:15.840
飽餐一頓
have a nice hot meal,


1640
01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:20.600
然後找到你老婆  送她去見你
I'm gonna find your wife and I'm gonna kill her too.


1641
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:32.250
喬伊  在這等我信號  其他人跟我進去
Joey, wait here for my call. The rest of you, start headin' in.


1642
01:50:32.250 --> 01:50:33.500
遵命
You got it.


1643
01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.460
他來了
Here he comes.


1644
01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:05.080
傑克  好久不見
Jack. Long time no see.


1645
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:07.260
好久不見
Long time no see.


1646
01:51:07.330 --> 01:51:09.790
你還是那麼不修邊幅
I see you're still spendin' all your money on clothes.


1647
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:11.000
是吧
Well, you know.


1648
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:14.430
你如果想要進城看戲
Listen, while you're in town, if you wanna go see a show,


1649
01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:15.980
或者蹭個飯什麼的
or want a free meal or something,


1650
01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:17.700
就來找我  好嗎
you just let me know, all right?


1651
01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:21.370
-我請客  我就是那麼大方  -夠意思
- On me. That's the type of guy I am. - You're a real sport.


1652
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:25.280
-快把磁碟給他  -你媽媽還好嗎
- Just give him the disks. - How's your mother?


1653
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:31.020
-她很好  -你女兒長大了吧
- She's all right. - Your daughter's gettin' big, grown up?


1654
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:37.100
我在想
You know, I was thinkin'.


1655
01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:39.600
要是你當時沒有撂挑子
Maybe if we would've done business way back when,


1656
01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.310
沒準現在也不會混到這個地步
you wouldn't look like a guy with a fuckin' cup in your hand.


1657
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:45.070
不過是討生活罷了
I'm tryin' to make a livin'.


1658
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:47.800
磁碟在你手上嗎
Listen. You got those disks,


1659
01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:50.410
還是跟你的工作一起丟了
or so did you lose them like you lost your job?


1660
01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:56.130
把磁碟給他  沃爾什
Give him the disks, Walsh.


1661
01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.100
我是看到你了  但我還沒看到"公爵"
Well, I see you, but I don't see the Duke.


1662
01:51:59.470 --> 01:52:02.370
-他的事一會再說  -我現在就要見他
- We'll worry about him in a minute. - We gotta worry about him now.


1663
01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:08.250
吉米  我不是來敘舊的
Let me tell you something, Jimmy. This isn't a reunion.


1664
01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:12.570
五秒內再見不到"公爵"我立馬走人
If I don't see the Duke in about five seconds, I'm walkin'.


1665
01:52:13.710 --> 01:52:17.110
你還是這副兇巴巴的樣兒
You know, you're still way too serious. Really.


1666
01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:19.380
不如把碟片給我
Listen. Why don't you just hand over the tapes?


1667
01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:20.770
然後一起過去接他
We'll take a walk, get the guy together.


1668
01:52:20.770 --> 01:52:23.120
-怎麼樣  -去你媽的  法庭見
- What do you say? - Fuck you, I'll see you at the arraignment.


1669
01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:27.110
-傑克  傑克  -他他媽要去哪兒
- Hey, Jack. Jack, hey. - Where the hell is he goin'?


1670
01:52:27.150 --> 01:52:29.090
-你贏了還不行嗎  -我什麼
- You win, all right? - I what?


1671
01:52:29.090 --> 01:52:32.140
你贏了  我他媽還得拿個擴音器和你說嗎
You won. What you want me to do, yell it all over this fucking airport?


1672
01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:35.410
他在哪兒
Where is he?


1673
01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:41.980
-這就來  -我說過別帶手下
- He's on his way. - You know, I said no goons.


1674
01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:43.810
別管他們  你馬上就要得到你想要的了
Never mind them. You're gonna get what you want.


1675
01:52:43.810 --> 01:52:45.320
不是跟你說過了嗎
Didn't I just tell you that?


1676
01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:48.020
我都快急出心臟病了
This thing is gonna give me a heart attack before it's all over.


1677
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.250
真能急死我
I know I'm gonna get a heart attack.


1678
01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.190
從我們見面那一刻
Since we have this moment to share together,


1679
01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:06.150
我就想問你了
there's something I've been meaning to ask you.


1680
01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:14.580
想到自己老婆和別的警察上床是什麼心情
Doesn't it bother you that another cop is fuckin' your wife?


1681
01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:18.890
你知道他們提拔他當副巡長了嗎
Do you know they made this guy a captain?


1682
01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:23.840
能想像嗎  想想吧  當副巡長的感覺
Can you imagine that? Go figure it out. Made him a captain.


1683
01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:33.240
有什麼事  先生
May I help you, sir?


1684
01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:35.190
一張去洛杉磯的單程票
Yeah. Give me a one-way ticket to L.A.


1685
01:53:35.410 --> 01:53:37.490
去洛杉磯的單程票
One-way ticket to Los Angeles.


1686
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:41.030
要吸煙艙還是禁煙艙
Will that be smoking or nonsmoking?


1687
01:53:41.590 --> 01:53:43.090
你說呢
Take a wild guess.


1688
01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.440
吸煙艙
Smoking.


1689
01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:58.650
您準備以什麼方式付款呢  先生
How will you be paying for this, sir?


1690
01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:08.320
糟糕
Aw, shit.


1691
01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:09.660
-怎麼了  -你看
- What is it? - Look.


1692
01:54:16.590 --> 01:54:18.550
他來這幹什麼
What the hell is he doing here?


1693
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:20.950
一名白人男性  一手提綠色旅行包
All right, we have a Male Caucasian carrying a green duffel bag,


1694
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:23.290
一手放在馬甲內  正向目標靠近
hands inside his vest, approaching subjects.


1695
01:54:23.290 --> 01:54:25.980
盡快將其制止  避免驚動目標
Get him out of there as quickly and as quietly as possible.


1696
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:29.880
開槍擊斃都行  一定要阻止他
Shoot him if you have to, but get him out of here.


1697
01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:32.980
-沒事吧  喬恩  -沒事

-所有人退下  -你他媽又是誰
- Back off, everybody. Back off. - Who the fuck are you?


1702
01:54:45.630 --> 01:54:46.570
幹什麼  查戶口嗎
What? Are you writin' a book?


1703
01:54:46.570 --> 01:54:49.020
-你他媽又是誰  -這人是誰
- Who the fuck are you? - Who is this guy?


1704

- I'm tellin' ya. Get out of here. - Take a...


1706

1707
01:54:56.020 --> 01:54:58.050
-你瘋了嗎  -我可不能空手而歸
- Are you crazy? - I didn't come all this way for nothin'.

他有沒有拿到磁碟
Did he or did he not take the disks?


1712
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:12.370
看不清  下面太混亂了
I couldn't tell. There's too much going on down there!


1713
01:55:14.810 --> 01:55:17.760
塞拉諾拿到磁碟了  他拿到磁碟了

If you think I'm fallin' for that shit again, you're crazy.


1716
01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:29.070
馬文  馬文  你這傻逼回頭看看會死啊
Marvin! Marvin, look out! You stupid fucker, will you look out!

吉米  有句話

1723
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:57.470
我十年前就想對你說了
I've been wanting to say to you for 10 years.
