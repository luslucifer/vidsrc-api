1
00:01:11.372 --> 00:01:12.872
Now how the hell
should I know?


2
00:01:12.957 --> 00:01:14.291
You said he was distraught.

3
00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:15.709
I didn't say I knew why.

4
00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:18.003
I mean, you don't
look too happy, either.


5
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.547
Will you excuse me?

6
00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:24.676
That's the fiance of the deceased.
Miss Leonore Lemmon.


7
00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:28.722
The one on the end is
a house guest. Robert Condon.


8
00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:32.434
The other two are friends,
Carol Van Ronkel and Bill Bliss.


9
00:01:32.518 --> 00:01:33.810
Bliss found the body.

10
00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:36.396
- What time the party start?
- Just after midnight.


11
00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:39.983
He woke up, came downstairs,

12
00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:42.193
said good night and went back to bed.

13
00:01:42.278 --> 00:01:45.071
The coroner's ruling,
it indicated suicide.


14
00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.535
Paterson.

15
00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:53.413
Yeah.

16
00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:08.762
The fiance said he was depressed.

17
00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:12.766
Also predicted he would do it.

18
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:17.145
He went upstairs, she told her pals
he was going to shoot himself.


19
00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:19.773
So, why didn't she stop him?

20
00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:23.860
Maybe she believed
what she saw on TV.


21
00:02:24.987 --> 00:02:26.154
On TV?

22
00:02:31.494 --> 00:02:32.869
What, him?

23
00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:34.829
Faster than a speeding bullet.

24
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:37.832
Hmm.

25
00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:48.194
Oh, hi.

26
00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:52.782
I have new information.

27
00:03:57.538 --> 00:03:58.997
Good.

28
00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.585
I went to the office on Rossmore.

29
00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:06.880
The office
is occupied by an orthodontist.


30
00:04:08.257 --> 00:04:11.050
You can imagine my consternation.

31
00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:13.928
We're setting up in a better location.

32
00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:17.765
It's right off Wilshire,
adding an operative.


33
00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:22.103
But delays, phone lines.
So, the time being...


34
00:04:22.188 --> 00:04:26.065
We have reason to believe that
my wife continues to engage in illicit


35
00:04:27.485 --> 00:04:28.985
carnal relations.

36
00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:33.781
I'm gonna take care of the mail.

37
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.366
Good.

38
00:04:39.663 --> 00:04:41.122
Mr Sinclair.

39
00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:46.669
We did check into that and
there was nothing we came up with.


40
00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:49.464
Yes, well, in that regard,
I blame myself.


41
00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:52.300
How's that?

42
00:04:55.554 --> 00:04:59.474
My wife became aware
of a change in my demeanour


43
00:04:59.558 --> 00:05:02.310
and curtailed her activities accordingly.

44
00:05:06.774 --> 00:05:10.276
- She still at Western Costume?
- I drop her off there every morning.


45
00:05:10.778 --> 00:05:12.320
What transpires after that...

46
00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:14.614
- All right, the fee is...
- $50 a day.


47
00:05:14.657 --> 00:05:16.866
Three-day minimum, in advance.

48
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.959
We'll do everything we can.

49
00:05:37.888 --> 00:05:39.556
It's not right, you know.

50
00:05:40.474 --> 00:05:41.808
His money.

51
00:05:42.268 --> 00:05:43.601
He's nuts.

52
00:05:51.735 --> 00:05:55.905
Don't give me grief, okay? Nobody said
you had to stay in Van Nuys.


53
00:05:56.115 --> 00:05:58.741
You're the one that wanted a backyard.

54
00:06:01.954 --> 00:06:03.496
What did I say?

55
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.505
Disneyland.

56
00:06:13.716 --> 00:06:15.174
He like it?

57
00:06:15.301 --> 00:06:18.511
Russ took him on a canoe,
the Indian Village.


58
00:06:18.637 --> 00:06:20.179
Seemed to go all right.

59
00:06:20.222 --> 00:06:21.389
Russ...

60
00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:23.850
Russell.

61
00:06:24.893 --> 00:06:26.185
Rusty...

62
00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.731
Am I supposed to ask your permission?

63
00:06:29.815 --> 00:06:33.067
I just want to make sure
his intentions are honourable.


64
00:06:34.778 --> 00:06:37.864
- Keeping busy?
- Yeah. May be something big.


65
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.119
- You don't believe me?
- Oh, I always believed you.


66
00:06:44.163 --> 00:06:45.538
Every time.

67
00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:49.250
Where's Evan?

68
00:06:59.595 --> 00:07:00.803
What's going on?

69
00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:04.015
That actor who shot himself,
the one who plays Superman.


70
00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:08.645
- What about him?
- It's made him very upset.


71
00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:12.315
He told you that?

72
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.318
Every kid on the block
is upset.


73
00:07:18.864 --> 00:07:22.575
Scout. Come on.
Your old pops is taking you to school.


74
00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:27.580
What's on your mind, Scout?

75
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:29.082
Nothing.

76
00:07:31.502 --> 00:07:32.752
Nothing?

77
00:07:33.337 --> 00:07:34.587
Nothing.

78
00:07:37.675 --> 00:07:39.884
You know, things you see on TV,

79
00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:43.513
you know,
someone's a cowboy or a spaceman,


80
00:07:44.348 --> 00:07:46.057
it's just pretend, right?

81
00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:47.433
I know.

82
00:07:47.476 --> 00:07:50.561
- You remember we talked about that?
- I remember.


83
00:07:51.397 --> 00:07:52.480
Okay.

84
00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:58.111
- Hey, what's this?
- I don't know.


85
00:07:58.195 --> 00:08:00.113
Well, why don't you find out?

86
00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:09.789
- Do you like that?
- Kind of.


87
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:13.042
All right, come on, turn the knobs.

88
00:09:11.852 --> 00:09:16.147
2:00 in the morning, I'm thinking,
maybe I ain't the best PI in California,


89
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:18.691
but if I catch a one-eyed Negro Jew

90
00:09:18.776 --> 00:09:22.361
sneaking into a house in Beverly Hills,
it's time to pack it in.


91
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.031
Davis is a very talented performer.

92
00:09:25.491 --> 00:09:26.908
What'd Rick do?

93
00:09:27.743 --> 00:09:31.370
What's the matter, Ace? Alpha Beta
not hiring any more parking lot guards?


94
00:09:31.497 --> 00:09:33.539
Not with you moonlighting, Chuck.

95
00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:37.960
Study this gentleman.
Observe him closely.


96
00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:39.754
The haircut, the getup.

97
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.590
Nobody told him the world don't need
two Ralph Meekers.


98
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.926
Listen to him, kid.

99
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.179
And don't start smoking, either.
Filthy habit.


100
00:09:48.263 --> 00:09:50.473
This isn't show business, pal.

101
00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:53.976
It's just a job. 
You punch in every day.

102
00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:57.814
- Let's get out of here.
- I'm still eating, Chuck.


103
00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.691
Come on.

104
00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:09.116
Sweetheart, cheque please.

105
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.330
Hey, Del.

106
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.170
- Rick working you hard?
- Payroll scam at Warners.


107
00:10:21.255 --> 00:10:25.174
- Well, that's real detective work.
- I'm a real detective.


108
00:10:28.095 --> 00:10:29.929
Anything you guys throwing away?

109
00:10:30.055 --> 00:10:32.306
- Jesus, Lou...
- Look, I'm asking.


110
00:10:32.432 --> 00:10:34.433
The shit you won't touch, come on.

111
00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:35.768
You will?

112
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.480
If it puts me in a Fleetwood
bigger than Ricky Harris', yeah.


113
00:10:39.606 --> 00:10:42.525
- He drives a Lincoln.
- Come on, Del, feed me something.


114
00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:45.444
- Why should I?
- 'Cause you owe me, partner.


115
00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:56.706
What?

116
00:10:59.626 --> 00:11:02.879
What, the guy who used to play
Superman? He shot himself, what?


117
00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:04.964
Someone thinks he didn't.

118
00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:06.966
Oh, yeah? Who?

119
00:11:08.677 --> 00:11:10.970
- His mother.
- His mother.


120
00:11:12.431 --> 00:11:15.808
- How do you know what she thinks?
- She tried to hire us this morning.


121
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:18.853
What does she have the cops don't?

122
00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:21.564
Look, you like a headline,
there's a headline.


123
00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:28.905
What did Rick say?

124
00:11:28.989 --> 00:11:33.326
Maybe you forgot, we're paid
to keep things out of the newspaper.


125
00:11:37.623 --> 00:11:40.333
Helen Bessolo. 
She's in from Illinois.

126
00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:43.669
At the Ambassador.
And you don't work for Rick Harris.


127
00:11:43.712 --> 00:11:46.464
- What?
- When you pitch her,


128
00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:49.175
you're not an associate,
you're not a stringer.


129
00:11:49.217 --> 00:11:51.344
Who said I'm pitching her?

130
00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:53.387
I'm done eating.

131
00:11:56.433 --> 00:11:57.892
Oh, I forgot.

132
00:11:58.644 --> 00:11:59.936
Have one.

133
00:12:01.897 --> 00:12:04.982
- Guess who's a daddy?
- It's a boy.


134
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.212
Mrs Bessolo? I'm Louis Simo.

135
00:12:26.713 --> 00:12:28.047
I called.

136
00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:41.018
Our children, yes.

137
00:12:42.771 --> 00:12:44.814
They'll always be our babies.

138
00:12:44.898 --> 00:12:46.857
You work for Mr Harris?

139
00:12:48.527 --> 00:12:52.571
I was an operative at the agency.
I branched out on my own.


140
00:12:54.199 --> 00:12:55.366
May I?

141
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.203
Now, there are certain situations

142
00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:04.041
the agency is not prepared to handle.

143
00:13:04.543 --> 00:13:06.168
They come to me.

144
00:13:08.714 --> 00:13:10.715
Your house full of strangers.

145
00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:13.884
- How's that?
- The ones there, that night.


146
00:13:14.428 --> 00:13:18.222
Van Ronkel, Bliss. 
And that woman.

147
00:13:18.265 --> 00:13:20.599
This is Lenore? The fiance?

148
00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:22.852
Leonore.

149
00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:26.605
How could you trust anything they say?

150
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:32.111
Did he give any indication to you?

151
00:13:34.406 --> 00:13:35.781
About what?

152
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:37.700
Being, you know,

153
00:13:39.202 --> 00:13:40.578
despondent?

154
00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:42.747
Why would he be?

155
00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:53.257
When was, if I may,
the last time you spoke with your son?


156
00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:01.974
Do you know a Herbert Spirakis?

157
00:14:03.477 --> 00:14:04.769
No.

158
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:08.522
He's also an investigator here.
Very professional.


159
00:14:09.524 --> 00:14:11.400
He says I have a case.

160
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.404
Mrs Bessolo, I'm gonna level with you,
all right?


161
00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:19.784
LAPD, Los Angeles Police Department,
they don't like to be shown up.


162
00:14:21.286 --> 00:14:25.164
Okay, they've already closed the door
on your son. It's a suicide. End of story.


163
00:14:25.248 --> 00:14:27.124
You want that door open again?

164
00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:30.127
You want to make the cops
and the DA pay attention?


165
00:14:31.505 --> 00:14:35.341
You need a headline this big,
only with the truth.


166
00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:40.304
So that everybody knows. Okay?
You got to shove it in their faces.


167
00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:42.932
Did Herbert Spirakis tell you that?

168
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:47.686
I have to pay by cheque.

169
00:14:49.064 --> 00:14:51.482
Five minutes.
I didn't let you in.


170
00:14:56.071 --> 00:14:58.364
Hey. The $20?

171
00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:00.866
Right.

172
00:15:02.828 --> 00:15:03.994
Sorry.

173
00:15:14.923 --> 00:15:18.884
Say, you know who people
wanted to see? Lana Turner's guy,


174
00:15:19.386 --> 00:15:21.804
- Stompanato.
- No kidding.


175
00:15:23.515 --> 00:15:25.057
I tell you, that kid of hers,

176
00:15:25.142 --> 00:15:27.977
the knife was practically
sticking out of his ass.


177
00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:30.813
- Think about how hard...
- What are these?


178
00:15:31.148 --> 00:15:32.273
Huh?

179
00:15:33.775 --> 00:15:35.151
These marks?

180
00:15:36.236 --> 00:15:39.613
What'd he do,
beat himself up before he shot himself?


181
00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:41.198
I don't know.

182
00:15:48.248 --> 00:15:50.249
Don't do that. Hey.

183
00:15:50.834 --> 00:15:52.668
I didn't say you
could touch anything.


184
00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:54.253
Don't worry about it.

185
00:15:54.296 --> 00:15:57.298
Put it down, the coroner's
gonna be back. You hear?


186
00:15:58.466 --> 00:16:01.010
Okay, that's it, you gotta go.

187
00:16:04.264 --> 00:16:07.224
So, pal, who's T.M.?

188
00:16:10.187 --> 00:16:14.106
Come on, what do you say?
You help me, I'll help you.


189
00:16:15.317 --> 00:16:17.902
George. George.

190
00:16:18.403 --> 00:16:19.445
Yes?

191
00:16:19.571 --> 00:16:21.614
Don't order any more drinks,
I can't afford it.


192
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.783
We couldn't afford the cover, Nati.
Drinks are just gravy. Hello.


193
00:16:24.868 --> 00:16:27.119
Billy Wilder. Hire me, please.

194
00:16:27.162 --> 00:16:28.621
We're two steps from the men's room.

195
00:16:28.705 --> 00:16:31.040
Anyone sees us,
they'll think we're queer.


196
00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:32.458
You do look fetching tonight.

197
00:16:34.002 --> 00:16:35.628
- Okay. I'm leaving.
- No, you're not.


198
00:16:35.712 --> 00:16:37.338
You're gonna stay right here

199
00:16:37.422 --> 00:16:40.090
and wait for the casting guy
from Fox, right there.


200
00:16:40.175 --> 00:16:42.551
You and I are going to practise
the fine art of being noticed


201
00:16:42.636 --> 00:16:45.721
without looking like you're trying.
Fred Zinnemann.


202
00:16:47.224 --> 00:16:50.142
- Who?
- He's a director. Pictures.


203
00:16:50.227 --> 00:16:51.560
He hires people.

204
00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:53.270
George, no one's going to
hire me, anyway.


205
00:16:59.569 --> 00:17:01.237
That's Rita Hayworth.

206
00:17:03.406 --> 00:17:04.615
George.

207
00:17:07.202 --> 00:17:08.953
That's Rita Hayworth.

208
00:17:10.997 --> 00:17:14.458
You look absolutely ravishing, Rita.

209
00:17:17.963 --> 00:17:20.047
- Miss Hayworth!
- This way.


210
00:17:20.131 --> 00:17:21.298
Thank you.

211
00:17:23.677 --> 00:17:25.261
Just made it.

212
00:17:25.345 --> 00:17:27.805
- I beg your pardon?
- Into the picture.


213
00:17:27.847 --> 00:17:30.724
Was someone taking a picture?
I hadn't noticed.


214
00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:38.357
- My, we're awfully well-trained. Mr...
- George Reeves.


215
00:17:39.943 --> 00:17:41.860
Was it the line or the delivery?

216
00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:44.196
- I laugh when I'm happy.
- I see.


217
00:17:44.281 --> 00:17:46.532
Who is it that I'm making so happy?

218
00:17:46.616 --> 00:17:49.660
- I'm Toni.
- Just a poor girl with no last name.


219
00:17:52.247 --> 00:17:54.248
I had no idea
I could spread this much joy.


220
00:17:54.332 --> 00:17:57.001
Well, who knows
what you might be spreading?


221
00:17:58.378 --> 00:18:01.505
- Your turn.
- I'm afraid you got me.


222
00:18:01.715 --> 00:18:03.382
This way, please.

223
00:18:03.466 --> 00:18:04.758
Thank you.

224
00:18:08.888 --> 00:18:10.389
For you, sir.

225
00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:14.893
Oh, George, George, George...

226
00:18:17.814 --> 00:18:22.151
- That was your first picture?
- That was my very first paid acting role.


227
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.195
Your very first paid acting role
was in Gone with the Wind,


228
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.905
- the biggest picture ever?
- That's right.


229
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.407
And yet, I don't remember you.

230
00:18:28.491 --> 00:18:30.409
You don't? How's this?

231
00:18:30.994 --> 00:18:33.871
"We want all your waltzes, first Brent,
then me, then Brent, then me..."


232
00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:35.539
- You were Tarleton!
- I was.


233
00:18:35.582 --> 00:18:38.375
- Your hair was orange!
- Hardly. It was tangerine.


234
00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:39.710
Ah, well.

235
00:18:40.295 --> 00:18:43.922
All right, then. That was your first.
What was your last?


236
00:18:44.424 --> 00:18:47.593
- That I'm fairly certain you didn't see.
- Try me.


237
00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:51.388
The Adventures of Sir Galahad,
boldest knight of the round table.


238
00:18:51.473 --> 00:18:54.266
Saturday morning serial, very cheap,
we all rode the same horse.


239
00:18:54.351 --> 00:18:56.310
Well, I'm sure you
did a wonderful, professional job


240
00:18:56.394 --> 00:18:57.895
and the children loved you.

241
00:18:57.979 --> 00:19:00.981
I don't know, it's a lot of waiting.

242
00:19:01.483 --> 00:19:05.778
A lot of wanting, and somehow,
that's your life.


243
00:19:06.613 --> 00:19:08.947
- How dare you.
- What?


244
00:19:09.074 --> 00:19:11.116
How dare you to permit me
to talk about myself


245
00:19:11.242 --> 00:19:14.286
when I'm standing next to
the most beautiful woman?


246
00:19:14.412 --> 00:19:16.455
Well, you're an actor.

247
00:19:18.416 --> 00:19:23.462
And how about you?
Those friends of yours, over at Ciro's?


248
00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:26.256
I know some of them.

249
00:19:26.674 --> 00:19:30.135
- Good people to know?
- Not if you know them.


250
00:19:30.845 --> 00:19:32.888
Really? That sounded sad.

251
00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:35.933
Not at all. I was aiming for mysterious.

252
00:19:36.017 --> 00:19:38.060
Mysterious is like this.

253
00:19:38.144 --> 00:19:41.105
Oh, that's good. 
Do another one.

254
00:19:42.732 --> 00:19:44.108
Noble.

255
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.567
Stoic.

256
00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:47.528
Heroic.

257
00:19:48.446 --> 00:19:49.947
Bad shellfish?

258
00:19:51.366 --> 00:19:53.117
Very good, exactly.

259
00:19:54.369 --> 00:19:56.370
Well, you don't seem sad.

260
00:19:56.704 --> 00:19:58.247
What if I were?

261
00:19:59.582 --> 00:20:01.250
I won't allow it.

262
00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.473
I'm much too old for you, you know.

263
00:20:25.024 --> 00:20:28.944
- We don't give out that information.
- Here's the thing, though.


264
00:20:29.779 --> 00:20:32.739
Mr... The person I work for, he...

265
00:20:34.617 --> 00:20:38.495
If I come back empty-handed,
I'll lose my job.


266
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.914
"Get me that watch that George had,"
he told me.


267
00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:43.500
- George?
- George Reeves.


268
00:20:43.585 --> 00:20:45.252
Oh, Mr Reeves.

269
00:20:45.336 --> 00:20:48.338
Yeah, they were very close.
Like brothers.


270
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.050
You know,
they spoke every week, until...


271
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.721
Who do you work for?

272
00:20:57.599 --> 00:21:00.893
No, I can't, I can't.
I just do what I'm told.


273
00:21:01.603 --> 00:21:05.647
If the rest of the world knew
what these stars were really like...


274
00:21:06.774 --> 00:21:09.151
Well, we got some stories, right?

275
00:21:10.153 --> 00:21:11.403
Hold on.

276
00:21:18.912 --> 00:21:23.916
A gold Chopard Quattro.
Unfortunately, no longer made.


277
00:21:27.045 --> 00:21:29.087
Well, he was a good customer?

278
00:21:29.214 --> 00:21:32.966
No, these are
Mrs Mannix's account. She...


279
00:21:33.092 --> 00:21:35.427
She bought him
a lot of things, you know.


280
00:21:35.553 --> 00:21:37.429
Of course. Say no more.

281
00:21:39.098 --> 00:21:42.351
- Maybe there's some old stock.
- I'd be grateful.


282
00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.280
No luck, huh?

283
00:21:57.242 --> 00:22:00.869
- I'll go break the bad news.
- If I showed you something else?


284
00:22:00.954 --> 00:22:03.455
No, I don't think that's gonna help.

285
00:22:04.582 --> 00:22:06.083
Spencer Tracy.

286
00:22:08.169 --> 00:22:11.964
- Now, how the heck did you...
- I'd heard he can be difficult.


287
00:22:12.966 --> 00:22:16.051
Oh, between you and me?
Complete prick.


288
00:23:34.505 --> 00:23:35.964
Good morning.

289
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.759
Good morning,

290
00:23:40.386 --> 00:23:41.803
Mrs Mannix.

291
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.284
I don't have a problem
with a man drinking before breakfast,


292
00:24:04.369 --> 00:24:07.079
but it is impolite
not to offer me any.

293
00:24:16.172 --> 00:24:20.092
Your husband
is the general manager of MGM.


294
00:24:21.678 --> 00:24:25.097
He gives the word, I'm stuck doing
serials for the rest of my life, at best.


295
00:24:25.181 --> 00:24:27.808
- He would never do that.
- No? Why not?


296
00:24:30.311 --> 00:24:32.521
Because it would hurt me.

297
00:24:32.605 --> 00:24:35.649
- What about me?
- It would hurt both of us.


298
00:24:39.487 --> 00:24:41.655
Look, whatever I said last night...

299
00:24:41.739 --> 00:24:43.365
It sounded true.

300
00:24:44.575 --> 00:24:47.411
Was it? Or were you acting?

301
00:24:50.373 --> 00:24:51.748
It was true.

302
00:24:54.419 --> 00:24:58.130
Listen, Eddie's got a mistress.

303
00:24:58.256 --> 00:25:00.257
Japanese girl, very sweet.

304
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.302
An apartment in Brentwood,
a cabin up in Big Bear.


305
00:25:05.012 --> 00:25:06.847
And what do you have?

306
00:25:09.726 --> 00:25:14.438
I have another seven good years.
Then my ass drops like a duffel bag.


307
00:25:15.398 --> 00:25:18.984
- Well, it seems all right now.
- Thank you for noticing.


308
00:25:23.281 --> 00:25:26.700
Tell me the truth.
Did you think I could help you?


309
00:25:29.245 --> 00:25:32.998
I thought that you were
the most beautiful girl in the room.


310
00:25:33.958 --> 00:25:35.500
And, yes, I did.

311
00:25:38.045 --> 00:25:40.380
Do you know who you looked like?

312
00:25:40.673 --> 00:25:42.048
Sir Galahad.

313
00:25:46.888 --> 00:25:50.766
George, nobody ever asked
to be happy later.


314
00:25:52.852 --> 00:25:54.770
Tell me what you want.

315
00:25:55.855 --> 00:25:57.439
You can have it.

316
00:26:04.989 --> 00:26:06.531
Should I leave?

317
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.327
No. You should stay.

318
00:26:21.631 --> 00:26:23.757
I got a fiancée, 
I got a mistress...

319
00:26:23.883 --> 00:26:26.134
Well, former mistress.
I'm not really sure on that yet,


320
00:26:26.219 --> 00:26:28.845
but I got bruises on the body... What?

321
00:26:34.977 --> 00:26:37.521
After you dropped her off,

322
00:26:37.563 --> 00:26:40.357
she never left the building, Mr Sinclair.

323
00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:43.527
I can't swear that nothing went on
in there, but she never left the building.


324
00:26:43.569 --> 00:26:45.904
There's an entrance in the rear.

325
00:26:46.364 --> 00:26:48.782
- Okay.
- And a loading dock.


326
00:26:49.742 --> 00:26:52.911
Neither would be visible
from your vantage point.


327
00:26:56.582 --> 00:27:01.294
Look, Mr Sinclair, maybe,
you know, you and your wife,


328
00:27:01.379 --> 00:27:04.047
you sit down,
you have a conversation and you see...


329
00:27:04.131 --> 00:27:06.383
This man. Here.

330
00:27:06.467 --> 00:27:09.761
- He works there.
- No. I've seen him before.


331
00:27:10.888 --> 00:27:13.849
Mr Simo, I have utter faith
in your abilities,


332
00:27:13.933 --> 00:27:16.268
but you might wish to
entertain the notion


333
00:27:16.394 --> 00:27:18.812
there is more going on
than you realise.


334
00:27:21.732 --> 00:27:23.400
"I, George Bessolo Reeves,

335
00:27:23.442 --> 00:27:25.986
"being of sound and disposing
mind and memory,


336
00:27:26.112 --> 00:27:28.321
"do declare this
my last will and testament.


337
00:27:28.447 --> 00:27:32.158
"I hereby give, devise and bequeath
all monies and personal property


338
00:27:32.285 --> 00:27:36.997
"owned by me at the time of
my death to Toni Lanier Mannix."


339
00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:38.164
What?

340
00:27:39.834 --> 00:27:42.919
- Maybe there's another will.
- There goddamn better be.


341
00:27:43.004 --> 00:27:44.921
Miss Lemmon,
can I talk to you for a minute?


342
00:27:44.964 --> 00:27:47.883
I'm Louis Simo,
I'm a private investigator.


343
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:51.261
I've been retained by Helen,
the bereaved mother...


344
00:27:51.304 --> 00:27:53.263
- Bitch!
- I agree.


345
00:27:53.306 --> 00:27:55.473
...of your late fiancé.
I was just wanting to know


346
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.641
if I could ask
you a couple of questions.

347
00:27:56.767 --> 00:27:58.268
You're not an investigator.

348
00:27:58.311 --> 00:28:01.563
Yes, I am, ma'am. I am licensed
by the State of California...


349
00:28:01.647 --> 00:28:03.982
You know what he is? A catfish.

350
00:28:04.066 --> 00:28:06.693
Go clean the mud out of your whiskers.

351
00:28:10.823 --> 00:28:12.198
"A catfish"?

352
00:28:19.832 --> 00:28:23.835
- Excuse me. You the Times?
- I'm the Times.


353
00:28:25.296 --> 00:28:26.630
You're the Times?

354
00:28:26.672 --> 00:28:29.049
What do you think about
Superman offing himself


355
00:28:29.175 --> 00:28:31.551
and cutting his beloved fiancée
out of the picture?


356
00:28:31.677 --> 00:28:35.889
Leaving the green to Eddie Mannix's
wife, huh? Like she needs the dough.


357
00:28:36.015 --> 00:28:37.849
Hell hath no fury, huh?

358
00:28:38.517 --> 00:28:40.685
I mean, people get killed
for less than that.


359
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.771
You saying
George Reeves was murdered?


360
00:28:42.855 --> 00:28:45.315
That's a heck of a question.

361
00:28:45.399 --> 00:28:46.566
What's your name?

362
00:28:46.651 --> 00:28:49.986
Louis Simo. S
-I
-M
-O.

363
00:29:09.131 --> 00:29:12.092
- Did you go to the doctor?
- I went.


364
00:29:12.218 --> 00:29:16.388
- What did he say?
- Those guys, they're all frauds.


365
00:29:17.431 --> 00:29:19.849
Not a very helpful attitude.

366
00:29:19.934 --> 00:29:22.978
Well, something
has to kill you, don't it?


367
00:29:24.438 --> 00:29:26.147
Oh, I guess so.

368
00:29:26.232 --> 00:29:29.192
- You under contract?
- I was, at Warners.


369
00:29:29.276 --> 00:29:32.487
- But now you're not.
- Now, no, no.


370
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:37.075
- Tough game.
- Well, I'm always ready to play.


371
00:29:42.248 --> 00:29:44.124
George was in
Gone With The Wind, Eddie.


372
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.334
That picture made money.

373
00:29:51.298 --> 00:29:54.300
So, what brought you to Los Angeles,
Miss Yoshida...


374
00:29:54.385 --> 00:29:57.137
- Don't talk to her.
- I'm sorry?


375
00:29:57.805 --> 00:30:00.640
- She doesn't speak English.
- Oh.


376
00:30:00.725 --> 00:30:02.892
Oh, yes.

377
00:30:09.942 --> 00:30:12.944
Eddie, I found a darling little place
up on Benedict.


378
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:17.115
It's about $12,000. 
I'd like to buy it.

379
00:30:18.534 --> 00:30:19.659
Well,

380
00:30:21.287 --> 00:30:23.496
it's a good investment. Right?

381
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:26.249
Well, you know
what they say about land.


382
00:30:26.333 --> 00:30:28.334
They ain't making more of it.

383
00:30:29.462 --> 00:30:30.837
What's not on the menu?

384
00:30:30.921 --> 00:30:33.631
We have some very nice
blue points set aside, Mr Mannix.


385
00:30:33.716 --> 00:30:36.509
- How's the flank steak?
- The flank steak is very good.


386
00:30:36.594 --> 00:30:40.764
Bring me that, Cobb salad,
dressing on the side, baked...


387
00:30:41.766 --> 00:30:43.224
I'm sorry.

388
00:30:45.519 --> 00:30:47.979
My wife will take another Gibson.

389
00:30:51.984 --> 00:30:54.027
Well, what do you think?

390
00:30:54.153 --> 00:30:56.988
The most I ever got from a girlfriend
was a tie.


391
00:30:57.031 --> 00:31:00.742
- Just how Toni does things, I guess.
- You should be happy, George.


392
00:31:00.826 --> 00:31:02.077
Wouldn't mind a job.

393
00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:05.914
Well, maybe she can put in a word.
With her... You know.


394
00:31:05.998 --> 00:31:08.500
Hey, take it.

395
00:31:09.335 --> 00:31:11.711
- What's this?
- It's a couple of hundred.


396
00:31:11.796 --> 00:31:15.548
- I see, but why are you giving it to me?
- Because I got it, you need it.


397
00:31:15.633 --> 00:31:17.759
Go ahead, kid, make your first million.

398
00:31:17.843 --> 00:31:20.678
- Your talent is required.
- All right.


399
00:32:04.306 --> 00:32:07.308
"Lois and Jimmy,
what have you done with them?"


400
00:32:07.393 --> 00:32:09.102
"They're safe for now, Superman.

401
00:32:09.186 --> 00:32:11.771
"Just don't get any big ideas
about stopping the robbery."


402
00:32:12.106 --> 00:32:14.232
"All right. You win this time.

403
00:32:14.316 --> 00:32:16.067
"But if something happens to them,

404
00:32:16.152 --> 00:32:19.445
"I promise you'll wish
this day never arrived."


405
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.408
Whenever you're ready, George.

406
00:32:24.326 --> 00:32:25.660
All right.

407
00:32:27.913 --> 00:32:29.622
"They're safe for now, Superman.

408
00:32:29.748 --> 00:32:33.418
"Just don't get any big ideas
about stopping the robbery."


409
00:32:33.919 --> 00:32:36.838
Actually, George,
you're reading the other role.


410
00:32:36.922 --> 00:32:39.799
- Oh, Superman.
- Yeah.


411
00:32:40.634 --> 00:32:43.094
He's, you know, the hero.

412
00:32:43.179 --> 00:32:46.389
I suppose I've always felt
more the criminal type.


413
00:32:46.807 --> 00:32:48.850
We're looking for
a new take here, George.


414
00:32:48.934 --> 00:32:53.354
Someone the kids will buy, sure,
but adults, too. It needs a real actor.


415
00:32:54.273 --> 00:32:57.942
What's the worst that could happen?
We offer you the part.


416
00:33:01.197 --> 00:33:02.864
Well, okay.

417
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:11.372
"All right, Mr Prince, I got
your message. What is it you want?"


418
00:33:11.457 --> 00:33:13.333
"It's not what I want, Superman,
it's what you want."


419
00:33:13.417 --> 00:33:16.002
"Listen. I'm not in the mood for games,

420
00:33:16.086 --> 00:33:17.712
"but I promise you this.

421
00:33:17.796 --> 00:33:20.048
"If anything happens to
Lois or to Jimmy..."


422
00:33:24.887 --> 00:33:29.599
An actor can't always act.
Sometimes he has to work.


423
00:33:29.642 --> 00:33:33.478
You're talking to the man who defended
Camelot with a cardboard sword.


424
00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.355
I enjoyed you in that.

425
00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:37.982
You were the oldest boy
in the theatre, Art.


426
00:33:38.025 --> 00:33:41.861
Look, it's a dirt-cheap kiddie show.
It doesn't even have a sponsor.


427
00:33:41.946 --> 00:33:45.531
- Odds are no one's ever gonna see it.
- It's just sounding better and better.


428
00:33:45.616 --> 00:33:47.867
And you need the money.

429
00:33:48.369 --> 00:33:51.746
- There's money.
- I mean money of your own.


430
00:33:56.085 --> 00:33:57.835
Oh, come on, George.

431
00:33:59.338 --> 00:34:01.172
What do you want from life?

432
00:34:01.215 --> 00:34:04.676
Oh, I don't know.
I'd settle for Clark Gable's career.


433
00:34:05.886 --> 00:34:08.346
Take the job, cash the cheque.

434
00:34:11.517 --> 00:34:13.935
Can I tell you something, Art?
Seriously.


435
00:34:14.186 --> 00:34:15.478
Of course.

436
00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:18.898
You're beautiful
when you take your glasses off.


437
00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:22.819
So, does this mean we're saying yes?

438
00:34:24.655 --> 00:34:28.491
Why is it so drab?
Superman wears blue and red.


439
00:34:28.534 --> 00:34:31.327
Not on TV, not enough contrast.

440
00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.872
But, maybe if the show flies,
they might film in colour.


441
00:34:34.915 --> 00:34:37.959
For when the colour sets come out.

442
00:34:38.043 --> 00:34:40.795
Then I'll get to
wear the blue and red.

443
00:34:50.514 --> 00:34:52.515
I look like a damn fool.

444
00:35:18.459 --> 00:35:21.294
- Nice car.
- That's my baby.


445
00:35:22.296 --> 00:35:23.838
- Lou?
- Yeah.


446
00:35:23.922 --> 00:35:26.424
Hey. I'm Russ Taylor. We're...

447
00:35:26.508 --> 00:35:27.675
Yeah, Goofy.

448
00:35:28.594 --> 00:35:31.512
- I'm sorry?
- You went to Disneyland.


449
00:35:31.597 --> 00:35:33.973
Oh, yeah, that's right, last week.

450
00:35:36.685 --> 00:35:40.688
She's a little upset. I happened to
be in the neighbourhood, so...


451
00:35:40.898 --> 00:35:42.565
That's convenient.

452
00:35:44.777 --> 00:35:46.569
Hey, he's a good kid.

453
00:35:48.072 --> 00:35:49.906
I saw that right off.

454
00:35:51.116 --> 00:35:54.535
Well, you would know, huh, Russ?

455
00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:06.297
The policy will cover it.
That's not a problem.


456
00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.800
But she's concerned.

457
00:36:08.842 --> 00:36:12.678
He took charcoal fluid, poured it
all over it and put it on the couch.


458
00:36:12.763 --> 00:36:14.639
Put what on the couch?

459
00:36:23.107 --> 00:36:24.982
What's the deal, Scout?

460
00:36:34.993 --> 00:36:37.328
Your mom is very upset with you.

461
00:36:45.129 --> 00:36:48.297
What if you
burnt the house down? Huh?


462
00:36:49.049 --> 00:36:51.050
You wouldn't have a place to live.

463
00:36:51.135 --> 00:36:54.929
You know people get killed in fires?
Huh? Use your noggin.


464
00:36:56.682 --> 00:37:00.226
- It was just to get rid of it.
- What, the costume?


465
00:37:01.353 --> 00:37:03.896
Scout, you begged me for that thing.

466
00:37:04.815 --> 00:37:08.693
- You wanted it so bad, you remember?
- Not any more.


467
00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:10.194
Why?

468
00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.574
He shot himself in the head
with a Luger.


469
00:37:15.325 --> 00:37:17.118
That's a Nazi pistol.

470
00:37:25.961 --> 00:37:29.005
So, you know this man?
He was an actor.


471
00:37:29.965 --> 00:37:32.425
And if he did shoot... 
Whatever he did.

472
00:37:33.886 --> 00:37:36.721
You can still
watch him on TV, can't you?


473
00:37:38.348 --> 00:37:40.391
Scout, I asked a question.

474
00:37:43.645 --> 00:37:45.813
- Evan, you hear what I'm saying?
- All right.


475
00:37:45.898 --> 00:37:48.357
Evan, you answer when I talk.

476
00:37:49.067 --> 00:37:51.736
Evan! Put it down!
Come on, what are you doing?


477
00:37:51.778 --> 00:37:53.613
- Let's leave it.
- Put it down.


478
00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:55.573
- Evan. Put it down!
- Louis!


479
00:37:55.616 --> 00:37:57.742
Stop it, okay, God damn it!

480
00:38:02.623 --> 00:38:03.998
This kid...

481
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.171
- Why do you even bother calling me?
- I don't know. Possibly you might care


482
00:38:10.255 --> 00:38:12.757
- that your son is having a...
- Maybe you should take a breath.


483
00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:15.760
I do care.
I care very much, he's my son.


484
00:38:15.886 --> 00:38:17.512
Just 'cause I don't have
every minute of the day...


485
00:38:17.596 --> 00:38:19.764
No, you have so much going on.

486
00:38:19.848 --> 00:38:22.934
Is that what this is? 'Cause I've heard it
already a thousand times from you.


487
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.477
The actor. This gimmick you're pulling.

488
00:38:24.603 --> 00:38:26.771
We noticed the item in the paper.

489
00:38:26.897 --> 00:38:28.606
- What? I was hired.
- Can't you see


490
00:38:28.732 --> 00:38:30.775
what these
endless little tricks wind up...


491
00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:31.943
This is how I make my fucking living.

492
00:38:31.985 --> 00:38:33.110
Lou, that kind of language...

493
00:38:33.153 --> 00:38:34.820
This is how I make money
that I send you.


494
00:38:34.947 --> 00:38:37.657
- I'm sorry, is this his business?
- I'm just trying to keep things civil.


495
00:38:37.741 --> 00:38:40.701
Russ, this is between Louis and me.

496
00:38:40.786 --> 00:38:44.956
Listen, Lou. He asked for you.
I wasn't gonna call you.


497
00:38:46.792 --> 00:38:48.084
He asked.

498
00:38:54.299 --> 00:38:58.094
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't be more help
but, after all, I'm not Superman.


499
00:38:58.136 --> 00:38:59.804
Jeepers, no, Mr Kent.

500
00:38:59.846 --> 00:39:02.473
I suppose that would be
too much to ask.


501
00:39:03.058 --> 00:39:06.143
I suppose it would, Lois.
I suppose it would.


502
00:39:10.148 --> 00:39:11.524
Sorry, that's me.

503
00:39:11.608 --> 00:39:13.317
Keep rolling.
Take it back a line, George.


504
00:39:13.402 --> 00:39:15.152
All right, Tommy. 
Where were we?

505
00:39:15.237 --> 00:39:18.406
Lois, would you like to see
the real Man of Steel?


506
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.658
Well, sure I would.

507
00:39:20.784 --> 00:39:22.994
All right then, here he is!

508
00:39:24.162 --> 00:39:26.289
You're next, Jimmy!
Leave the bowtie on!


509
00:39:26.331 --> 00:39:28.291
Great Caesar's ghost!

510
00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:31.836
More powerful than a locomotive,
Chief! No one is safe!


511
00:39:35.007 --> 00:39:36.716
What did you think?

512
00:39:38.176 --> 00:39:42.179
The scripts are awful.
And everything looks cheap.


513
00:39:43.056 --> 00:39:46.142
- You were charming.
- Well, that's all that matters.


514
00:39:49.688 --> 00:39:51.522
She's a lesbian, you know.

515
00:39:51.607 --> 00:39:53.691
- Who?
- The one playing Lois.


516
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.361
- Mr Reeves?
- Hello?


517
00:39:57.487 --> 00:39:59.614
- Whenever you're ready.
- All right.


518
00:39:59.698 --> 00:40:02.033
- Phyllis? Is she really?
- No.


519
00:40:03.035 --> 00:40:05.786
She is now. As far as you're concerned.

520
00:40:07.748 --> 00:40:09.874
Well. There it is.

521
00:40:12.836 --> 00:40:14.086
Cue fans!

522
00:40:16.131 --> 00:40:18.382
Action, George! One!

523
00:40:19.509 --> 00:40:20.551
Two!

524
00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.387
Three!

525
00:40:36.693 --> 00:40:38.486
Cut it! Cut it!

526
00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:40.404
Unhook him!

527
00:40:42.366 --> 00:40:44.200
You all right, George?
Leave him alone.


528
00:40:44.284 --> 00:40:46.494
All right, let him go.
All right, all right.


529
00:40:49.206 --> 00:40:51.791
I'd like to thank the Academy

530
00:40:52.584 --> 00:40:55.628
and all the good people
of Galesburg, Illinois,


531
00:40:55.754 --> 00:40:57.922
for making me who I am today.

532
00:41:00.634 --> 00:41:02.593
Okay, everybody, let's take 10.

533
00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:27.284
Okay.

534
00:41:31.164 --> 00:41:33.958
Who was that next to you
when I came in?


535
00:41:34.876 --> 00:41:37.461
Chad. He's in my acting class.

536
00:41:38.171 --> 00:41:39.296
Yeah?

537
00:41:41.174 --> 00:41:44.343
- He any good?
- He's okay, I guess.


538
00:41:46.054 --> 00:41:50.057
You shouldn't hang around people
who are less talented than you.


539
00:41:51.643 --> 00:41:53.644
You've never seen me act.

540
00:41:54.813 --> 00:41:55.813
So?

541
00:41:56.857 --> 00:41:59.442
So, you don't know if I'm talented.

542
00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:04.905
You don't know what I could do.

543
00:42:07.033 --> 00:42:09.827
You don't know
a thing about me, do you?


544
00:42:32.684 --> 00:42:34.393
You ever going to tell me
how you got that?


545
00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:36.520
- What?
- Under your armpit.


546
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.942
- Something stupid.
- A fight?


547
00:42:45.113 --> 00:42:48.532
My pop,
he was on the gate at Warners.


548
00:42:49.034 --> 00:42:50.201
A guard?

549
00:42:50.327 --> 00:42:53.704
Yeah, he used to go to work
in this uniform.


550
00:42:53.789 --> 00:42:56.665
You know, crease in the pants
like a knife.


551
00:42:58.376 --> 00:43:01.378
I used to think
he was the Chief of Police.


552
00:43:02.714 --> 00:43:04.381
He... He did that?

553
00:43:06.218 --> 00:43:08.511
I was a month out of the Army.

554
00:43:09.429 --> 00:43:13.766
It was 1946, so no job.
You know, Pop got me set up.


555
00:43:14.726 --> 00:43:19.313
And there was a strike at the studios.
So, keep the union guys off the lot.


556
00:43:20.899 --> 00:43:24.401
You know, platoon around the gate,
me and 40 other saps.


557
00:43:26.238 --> 00:43:29.907
You know, bats and billy clubs.
Got out of hand.


558
00:43:32.244 --> 00:43:35.287
Little Teamster shit
came at me with a razor.


559
00:43:35.372 --> 00:43:38.082
Two years in North Africa,
all I get are crabs.


560
00:43:38.166 --> 00:43:41.877
Six days in Burbank, and... Man.

561
00:43:46.007 --> 00:43:47.925
And my pop apologised.

562
00:43:49.511 --> 00:43:50.761
To you?

563
00:43:53.348 --> 00:43:54.849
To the studio.

564
00:43:56.059 --> 00:43:58.060
For his son screwing up.

565
00:44:00.105 --> 00:44:02.648
Like the chicken-shit peasant he was.

566
00:44:09.865 --> 00:44:12.867
- What's that look?
- I'm just watching you.


567
00:44:18.498 --> 00:44:21.667
- Mrs Bessolo.
- I don't need this.


568
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.378
I do. Sit down, please.

569
00:44:24.796 --> 00:44:26.297
Mrs Bessolo.

570
00:44:28.842 --> 00:44:30.217
Right here.

571
00:44:31.386 --> 00:44:32.970
- Mrs Bessolo.
- Mrs Bessolo.


572
00:44:33.054 --> 00:44:35.389
I'm James Engelmann,
from RKO-Pathe Studios.


573
00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:37.933
- The what?
- Superman was filmed on our lot.


574
00:44:38.018 --> 00:44:41.979
And I'm here to express
how saddened we are over your loss.


575
00:44:42.063 --> 00:44:45.774
My son was not lost, Mr Engelmann.
He was taken.


576
00:44:46.318 --> 00:44:49.403
- One more, Mrs Bessolo.
- Over here, Mrs Bessolo.


577
00:44:51.281 --> 00:44:53.449
What the hell
did you drag them here for?


578
00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:55.492
Freedom of the press, right?

579
00:45:09.215 --> 00:45:12.551
- These in the report?
- They weren't there then.


580
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:18.515
Hang on there, Mrs Bessolo, hang on,
hang on. Come on.


581
00:45:19.601 --> 00:45:22.186
- Just let me sit for a minute.
- Okay.


582
00:45:22.312 --> 00:45:23.979
Come on, make yourself useful,
grab a chair.


583
00:45:24.022 --> 00:45:26.982
- Sure.
- Come on, let's get her out of here.


584
00:45:27.025 --> 00:45:28.525
There you go.

585
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:31.070
There you go.

586
00:45:33.573 --> 00:45:38.035
Okay? There you go, very good.
Okay, good.


587
00:45:38.119 --> 00:45:39.411
Here.

588
00:45:40.413 --> 00:45:44.166
Okay? I'm gonna go handle this.
You just relax.


589
00:45:45.877 --> 00:45:49.505
- Is she all right?
- That's her boy's blood. You tell me.


590
00:45:52.801 --> 00:45:55.052
The deceased woke up,

591
00:45:55.136 --> 00:45:57.554
joined his guests
for approximately half an hour,


592
00:45:57.681 --> 00:46:01.934
returned to bed, no sign of forced entry
or physical struggle.


593
00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:06.438
The Luger, found there on the floor,
heavily oiled. No prints.


594
00:46:07.107 --> 00:46:09.274
He kept it in the nightstand.

595
00:46:09.609 --> 00:46:12.361
The slug, there.

596
00:46:13.488 --> 00:46:17.032
And the casing, on the bed,
underneath the body.


597
00:46:17.117 --> 00:46:20.244
You want to explain to me
how a man can shoot himself


598
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:21.912
and end up on top of the shell?

599
00:46:22.038 --> 00:46:24.581
Is this your strategy, Mr Simo?
To impugn the laws of physics?


600
00:46:24.708 --> 00:46:26.166
There's no prints on the gun.

601
00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:28.544
What, did he wipe it clean
after putting that hole in his head?


602
00:46:28.586 --> 00:46:31.380
Prints aren't automatic.
Certain conditions have to be present.


603
00:46:31.423 --> 00:46:32.965
Did you question the people
in the house?


604
00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:34.299
They all signed sworn statements.

605
00:46:34.426 --> 00:46:36.135
Forty-five minutes to call the cops.

606
00:46:36.219 --> 00:46:38.679
That's plenty of time to come up
with some bogus story.


607
00:46:38.763 --> 00:46:41.265
- But you got sworn statements.
- You accusing me of something?


608
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:43.100
Was Reeves
checked for powder burns?


609
00:46:43.184 --> 00:46:45.394
It's a suicide shot to the temple.
Where's the burn?


610
00:46:45.478 --> 00:46:47.438
When a gun is discharged
directly against...


611
00:46:47.522 --> 00:46:49.064
Listen, the coroner never checked.

612
00:46:49.149 --> 00:46:50.899
He didn't notice
the bruises on the body, either.


613
00:46:50.984 --> 00:46:53.777
Which, by the way,
aren't automatic, okay?


614
00:46:53.862 --> 00:46:56.113
Certain conditions have to be present.

615
00:46:56.197 --> 00:46:58.991
Like, maybe a fight with a guy
that's about to...


616
00:47:00.994 --> 00:47:02.953
Cause your expiration.

617
00:47:17.635 --> 00:47:20.220
He won't be buried in that cape.

618
00:47:20.305 --> 00:47:23.390
Mrs Bessolo,
RKO-Pathe would be honoured


619
00:47:23.475 --> 00:47:26.727
to help you pay
for any sort of a floral tribute


620
00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:29.438
that you might deem
appropriate for your son.


621
00:47:35.987 --> 00:47:39.823
Since when do suicides miss twice,
lay down a rug and start over?


622
00:47:41.409 --> 00:47:43.577
Is that normal? Just asking.

623
00:47:45.163 --> 00:47:48.791
That cost the studio 15 grand.

624
00:47:49.292 --> 00:47:51.251
You think you're worth that?

625
00:47:51.336 --> 00:47:52.377
We were just...

626
00:47:52.462 --> 00:47:55.172
This Farmer's Daughter picture.
What is it?


627
00:47:56.508 --> 00:47:59.843
The Mating Game.
A $1 million investment.


628
00:47:59.928 --> 00:48:02.179
You think I'm going to
let you fuck with that?


629
00:48:02.263 --> 00:48:03.764
You think you're gonna be a star?

630
00:48:03.848 --> 00:48:06.350
- Our concern here is...
- You're a face.


631
00:48:06.476 --> 00:48:08.811
- Faces change.
- What Mr Mannix means...


632
00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:12.022
He knows what I mean.
Out of my sight.


633
00:48:20.782 --> 00:48:22.449
Set something up.

634
00:48:23.076 --> 00:48:26.411
Him and some starlet.

635
00:48:28.123 --> 00:48:31.208
Picnic, soda pop.

636
00:48:31.292 --> 00:48:32.626
Already arranged.

637
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:35.629
They treat their contract
like shit, Howard.


638
00:48:37.465 --> 00:48:39.633
Whatever the fuck they want.

639
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.053
The business is changing.

640
00:48:44.347 --> 00:48:46.098
Fags and television.

641
00:48:48.893 --> 00:48:50.727
And what are we, huh?

642
00:48:51.855 --> 00:48:53.897
The Last of the Mohicans.

643
00:48:55.441 --> 00:48:57.651
That was a UA picture, Eddie.

644
00:49:00.155 --> 00:49:02.656
That spic,

645
00:49:03.992 --> 00:49:06.827
wop, prick detective.

646
00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:09.913
I sent Jim Engelmann over.
He used to work for us.


647
00:49:09.998 --> 00:49:12.082
I'm sure you don't want
MGM coming into it.


648
00:49:12.208 --> 00:49:14.668
- And?
- Louis Simo.


649
00:49:15.503 --> 00:49:17.337
Two years with Rick Harris.

650
00:49:17.422 --> 00:49:19.423
He shot his mouth off
about Susan Humphries


651
00:49:19.465 --> 00:49:22.634
to Confidential for $5,000.
Harris fired him.


652
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.470
- Susan Humphries?
- Jennifer Jones type.


653
00:49:25.597 --> 00:49:28.182
Under contract at Fox. 
Heroin addict.

654
00:49:28.933 --> 00:49:32.728
- Drove off Topanga doing 90.
- You have a good memory, Eddie.


655
00:49:33.938 --> 00:49:37.941
- What's the prick want?
- Money. Press. Whatever he can grab.


656
00:49:39.944 --> 00:49:43.322
- What's he got?
- Some questions.


657
00:49:58.796 --> 00:50:01.006
My wife won't get out of bed.

658
00:50:02.467 --> 00:50:05.719
It's been almost a week,
she won't get out.


659
00:50:05.803 --> 00:50:09.681
- I'll stop by and see her.
- Do that. Cheer her up.


660
00:50:10.642 --> 00:50:12.434
She always liked you.

661
00:50:14.729 --> 00:50:17.105
- Eddie.
- Yeah?


662
00:50:17.732 --> 00:50:20.901
- You have anything to tell me?
- About what?


663
00:50:20.985 --> 00:50:24.821
Anything I need to
have a story ready for.


664
00:50:34.666 --> 00:50:37.167
- She's not here.
- Miss Lemmon?


665
00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:39.878
- That's interesting.
- What is?


666
00:50:40.338 --> 00:50:44.508
That you thought I wanted to
talk to her, since this is your house.


667
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:53.725
Is that your father?

668
00:50:55.103 --> 00:50:57.271
- My husband.
- Oh, sorry.


669
00:50:59.357 --> 00:51:01.191
He's a screenwriter.

670
00:51:02.151 --> 00:51:03.986
Well, no one could blame you
for wanting to hang around


671
00:51:04.028 --> 00:51:06.196
people your own age.

672
00:51:06.239 --> 00:51:09.366
What was his name again?
Robert Condon?


673
00:51:09.409 --> 00:51:10.867
I'm sure you're just friends.

674
00:51:13.538 --> 00:51:14.913
Around back.

675
00:51:27.343 --> 00:51:29.720
You really ought to prune these.

676
00:51:30.471 --> 00:51:34.558
My husband does the gardening.
It takes his mind off his writing.


677
00:51:35.393 --> 00:51:38.395
Well, what do you do,
Mrs Van Ronkel?


678
00:51:39.856 --> 00:51:42.190
I don't go around
trying to get my picture in the paper.


679
00:51:42.233 --> 00:51:44.109
You saw that, huh?

680
00:51:44.235 --> 00:51:47.779
What are you going to do
when this blows up in your face?


681
00:51:48.614 --> 00:51:50.741
There are two holes
in the bedroom floor.


682
00:51:50.825 --> 00:51:52.617
What do you know about that?

683
00:51:52.744 --> 00:51:54.244
- Leonore made them.
- Yeah?


684
00:51:54.329 --> 00:51:56.330
- Months ago.
- Why?


685
00:51:56.998 --> 00:51:58.290
I asked her to.

686
00:51:58.416 --> 00:52:01.084
You asked her
to shoot a gun in the floor.


687
00:52:01.169 --> 00:52:03.837
When you're drunk, everything's funny.

688
00:52:06.174 --> 00:52:09.343
He shoots himself, you all wait

689
00:52:09.427 --> 00:52:10.927
That's unusual.

690
00:52:11.471 --> 00:52:14.681
You ever been to a party where a man
goes upstairs and blows his head off?


691
00:52:14.766 --> 00:52:15.849
No.

692
00:52:15.933 --> 00:52:17.809
Then how do you know
what's unusual?


693
00:52:20.605 --> 00:52:24.399
- So how do I find Miss Lemmon?
- She's not the way you think she is.


694
00:52:24.442 --> 00:52:27.027
Yeah? What way is she?

695
00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.031
She was only looking for love.

696
00:52:33.618 --> 00:52:36.661
I just want to remember that one.
That's good.


697
00:52:41.876 --> 00:52:44.961
That's nice, it's very futuristic.

698
00:52:46.381 --> 00:52:49.341
- Hey, you're a detective, right?
- Yeah.


699
00:52:50.051 --> 00:52:54.137
So, men hire you to find out what
their wives are up to, that sort of thing?


700
00:52:54.263 --> 00:52:55.972
Yeah, they do that.

701
00:52:56.057 --> 00:52:58.475
Does the truth make them happier?

702
00:53:00.019 --> 00:53:01.478
Hardly ever.

703
00:53:04.357 --> 00:53:07.150
You know,
he wasn't going to marry her.


704
00:53:08.903 --> 00:53:10.153
Reeves?

705
00:53:10.655 --> 00:53:11.738
How do you know?

706
00:53:11.823 --> 00:53:14.533
Oh, she ran over here
when he told her.


707
00:53:15.535 --> 00:53:17.285
I heard every word.

708
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.581
And how did Miss Lemmon react?

709
00:53:23.418 --> 00:53:26.628
Like a longshoreman on a bender.

710
00:54:07.295 --> 00:54:08.462
- Christ!
- Fuck you.


711
00:54:08.546 --> 00:54:11.173
Nobody wants to hear
your mopey singing.


712
00:54:11.215 --> 00:54:12.883
This is my house.

713
00:54:12.925 --> 00:54:15.510
I'm tired of you treating it
like a goddamn bus station.


714
00:54:15.553 --> 00:54:17.262
Woe is fucking me.

715
00:54:22.477 --> 00:54:24.769
You goddamn miserable son of a bitch.

716
00:54:24.854 --> 00:54:26.646
- Christ!
- Don't you walk away from me.


717
00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:27.939
Shut up!

718
00:54:28.024 --> 00:54:30.066
I haul myself out
to this shithole burg for you,


719
00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:32.194
and you have the balls
to tell me it's off?


720
00:54:32.278 --> 00:54:36.323
God damn it.
Listen, what are you doing?


721
00:54:36.407 --> 00:54:39.242
- Put that...
- I'm the fucking man in this room!


722
00:54:39.327 --> 00:54:41.244
- You're a fool!
- Do something, all right?


723
00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:44.331
- You has-been! You sad old drunk!
- Give it to me! God damn it!


724
00:54:50.963 --> 00:54:52.255
Georgie?

725
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.639
I had to take a leak.
What's your excuse?


726
00:56:24.724 --> 00:56:26.433
This is a sealed crime scene.

727
00:56:26.976 --> 00:56:30.520
Then I guess we both deserve
to get our bottoms spanked.


728
00:56:38.696 --> 00:56:39.738
What's that?

729
00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:43.450
Last I looked, it was $4,000
in traveller's cheques.


730
00:56:44.744 --> 00:56:47.454
Georgie put it aside
for our honeymoon.


731
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:51.249
- That's off the plate now, isn't it?
- Is that why you killed him?


732
00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:55.962
You think he was rich?
That Superman gig paid shit.


733
00:56:56.047 --> 00:56:59.716
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe you found out
a little too late.


734
00:57:03.554 --> 00:57:08.516
He was fun, knocked back the booze
like nobody's business.


735
00:57:09.977 --> 00:57:13.021
Pretty good in the sack. Yeah.

736
00:57:13.564 --> 00:57:14.689
Yeah?

737
00:57:16.067 --> 00:57:18.735
Lady, I can nail you with this.

738
00:57:18.778 --> 00:57:23.615
D'Artagnan, you couldn't nail me
with roses and a trip to Vegas.


739
00:57:24.742 --> 00:57:26.576
And you're not a cop.

740
00:57:27.787 --> 00:57:29.412
So what the hell are you doing
following me


741
00:57:29.497 --> 00:57:31.498
into my dead fiancé's bedroom?

742
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:37.337
"And then, Mr Simo showed me
his member, Your Honour.


743
00:57:38.714 --> 00:57:40.757
"And I became frightened."

744
00:57:44.011 --> 00:57:45.679
You're in my way.

745
00:57:48.432 --> 00:57:52.936
- I'm going to be on you, Miss Lemmon.
- Not unless you dope me first.


746
00:58:00.778 --> 00:58:03.780
See how I got us in the paper?
Look at this.


747
00:58:06.701 --> 00:58:09.744
Guaranteed, LAPD
is going to sweat this.


748
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:11.955
Now, the more heat they feel,

749
00:58:12.039 --> 00:58:13.748
the more pressure they're under
to reopen the case.


750
00:58:13.833 --> 00:58:16.960
- The police reopened the case?
- No.


751
00:58:17.044 --> 00:58:18.962
They will if I keep it up.

752
00:58:19.046 --> 00:58:21.548
Which requires a financial commitment
from you


753
00:58:21.632 --> 00:58:23.633
so I can go on hammering.

754
00:58:27.263 --> 00:58:30.140
I did get a copy of the police report.
Lots of holes.


755
00:58:30.266 --> 00:58:32.642
And I'm not talking about the ones
in the floor.


756
00:58:32.685 --> 00:58:36.146
Plus, something else.
Your son called the wedding off.


757
00:58:36.397 --> 00:58:38.565
That's a new motive
for Miss Lemmon, okay?


758
00:58:38.649 --> 00:58:42.318
- And I intend to go...
- She was never going to be his wife.


759
00:58:42.987 --> 00:58:44.696
Oh, yeah? You knew that
he didn't plan on...


760
00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.949
Do you think my own son
would get married without telling me?


761
00:58:48.033 --> 00:58:50.326
And to a greedy slut like that?

762
00:58:55.916 --> 00:58:57.667
All these people...

763
00:59:01.672 --> 00:59:02.839
What about them?

764
00:59:02.965 --> 00:59:05.675
They're sitting around
like they're so big.


765
00:59:06.302 --> 00:59:08.344
I don't know who they are.

766
00:59:10.222 --> 00:59:14.350
George starred with
Sinatra, with Gable.


767
00:59:15.102 --> 00:59:17.395
He was an important film actor.

768
00:59:27.323 --> 00:59:31.659
- Someone else can do that, you know.
- Well, now, it's a beautiful car.


769
00:59:31.744 --> 00:59:33.536
Ought to keep it clean.

770
00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:37.081
Why? Does this offend
your delicate sensibilities?


771
00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:40.710
Yes. But you're new on the job,
so I'll let it pass.


772
00:59:44.882 --> 00:59:48.468
Art got a call.
They're picking up Superman.


773
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:50.720
They're what?

774
00:59:51.388 --> 00:59:53.389
Kellogg's. They bought it.

775
00:59:53.474 --> 00:59:56.184
- After two years?
- That's right.


776
00:59:56.268 --> 00:59:58.770
I will be on television in a month.

777
00:59:59.688 --> 01:00:02.148
Wearing brown and grey underpants.

778
01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:03.775
Well?

779
01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:06.861
- Hooray!
- Christ.


780
01:00:08.489 --> 01:00:10.281
Well, maybe it wasn't
your proudest moment.


781
01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:12.242
No, I'm quite sure it wasn't.

782
01:00:12.284 --> 01:00:17.747
But you did create a very likeable,
very attractive, very heroic character.


783
01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:19.249
Is that right?

784
01:00:20.501 --> 01:00:22.502
I'd fuck you in a second.

785
01:00:23.504 --> 01:00:25.922
Well, one thing we can be sure of.

786
01:00:26.006 --> 01:00:28.842
No one with a lick of sense
would watch that show.


787
01:00:37.852 --> 01:00:40.103
Faster than a speeding bullet.

788
01:00:40.729 --> 01:00:43.106
More powerful than a locomotive.

789
01:00:44.066 --> 01:00:46.985
Able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound.


790
01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:48.486
Look!
Up in the sky!


791
01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:49.946
It's a bird!
It's a plane!


792
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:51.322
It's Superman!

793
01:00:51.448 --> 01:00:52.866
Yes, it's Superman!

794
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.492
Strange visitor from another planet

795
01:00:54.618 --> 01:00:56.828
who can change the course
of mighty rivers,


796
01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:59.163
bend steel in his bare hands,

797
01:00:59.248 --> 01:01:03.001
and who, disguised as Clark Kent,
fights a never-ending battle


798
01:01:03.085 --> 01:01:06.421
for truth, justice,
and the American way!


799
01:01:08.173 --> 01:01:11.968
"Homes with children.
Adventures of Superman,


800
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.971
"91 rating."

801
01:01:15.389 --> 01:01:17.473
What does that mean?
No adults are watching?


802
01:01:17.558 --> 01:01:20.977
No, they're watching
with the kids, George. Families.


803
01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:25.148
Kellogg's has ordered 26 more.
They want to film in colour.


804
01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:28.526
Well, I'll get to
wear the blue and red.

805
01:01:34.241 --> 01:01:37.327
- Maybe you ought to put that out.
- What for?


806
01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:46.544
Superman doesn't smoke.

807
01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:56.471
- Sir.
- Thank you.


808
01:02:11.403 --> 01:02:15.990
Art, I'm coming right back.
Keep your mitts off my grub.


809
01:02:17.576 --> 01:02:18.952
All right.

810
01:02:38.764 --> 01:02:40.264
George Reeves?

811
01:02:49.775 --> 01:02:51.776
Excuse me, Mr Zinnemann.

812
01:02:52.236 --> 01:02:55.905
George Reeves will be reading
for the role of Maylon Stark.


813
01:02:57.074 --> 01:02:59.075
Good morning, one and all.

814
01:03:00.703 --> 01:03:02.829
Superman was on pain pills.

815
01:03:05.624 --> 01:03:08.334
So he crashed his car
a couple of months back.


816
01:03:08.419 --> 01:03:10.920
- Almost got killed.
- Drunk?


817
01:03:11.005 --> 01:03:14.841
- There wasn't any brake fluid.
- How do you know that?


818
01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:19.345
I went down to the Esso station
at the bottom of Benedict.


819
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:23.474
I said I was from the insurance
company. I spoke to a Mr Phelps.


820
01:03:23.559 --> 01:03:26.686
- He was very friendly.
- Leak in the lining?


821
01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:30.690
Mr Phelps couldn't find one.
Not bad, huh?


822
01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:34.402
But they were still getting married,
at least then, as far as she knew.


823
01:03:34.445 --> 01:03:36.779
Well, wouldn't that be why?

824
01:03:36.905 --> 01:03:41.284
- Why Leonore drains his brake fluid?
- Why Mrs Mannix does.


825
01:03:41.326 --> 01:03:43.870
He leaves her, right?
For this younger woman.


826
01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:47.040
- She can't bear it...
- And Toni wants him dead.


827
01:03:47.916 --> 01:03:50.168
Well, wouldn't that be better?

828
01:03:52.463 --> 01:03:55.381
Help! Help!
They've robbed the Docville Bank!


829
01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:10.646
Superman!

830
01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:16.194
Stop right there!

831
01:04:18.072 --> 01:04:20.698
What's that? Someone's in need.

832
01:04:31.543 --> 01:04:33.878
You can't see my penis, can you?

833
01:05:21.885 --> 01:05:25.555
Hey, Superman! Hey, Superman!

834
01:05:25.931 --> 01:05:28.224
Well, hello there, young man,
what's your name?


835
01:05:28.308 --> 01:05:31.894
Kenneth Giles. 
Can I shoot you?

836
01:05:42.948 --> 01:05:46.909
Kenneth, why would you want
to do something like that?


837
01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:49.829
So the bullet bounces off. Can I?

838
01:05:52.499 --> 01:05:57.920
Well, if you did shoot me
and the bullet bounced off,


839
01:05:57.963 --> 01:06:00.673
it might accidentally hit someone else.

840
01:06:01.133 --> 01:06:03.968
- We don't want that to happen, do we?
- No.


841
01:06:05.762 --> 01:06:10.016
Why don't you just, you and I...
Here we go, partner.


842
01:06:10.517 --> 01:06:13.978
Why don't you just give me that?
Just hand me that...


843
01:06:14.062 --> 01:06:15.521
One minute...

844
01:06:17.357 --> 01:06:20.109
You think
I don't see what you're doing?


845
01:06:20.235 --> 01:06:23.029
- I'm sorry?
- Day after day, taking pictures.


846
01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:25.114
I'm just waiting for the traffic.

847
01:06:25.199 --> 01:06:27.241
He leaves those where I can see them.

848
01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:31.078
And then he pretends
he doesn't know what I'm talking about.


849
01:06:31.705 --> 01:06:34.540
- Miss Sinclair...
- What is he paying you?


850
01:06:34.625 --> 01:06:35.833
That's confidential.

851
01:06:35.918 --> 01:06:38.419
He's been out of work
for seven months.


852
01:06:38.503 --> 01:06:41.339
I don't know what he does all day.
He won't tell me.


853
01:06:41.423 --> 01:06:43.925
Now, why don't you investigate that?

854
01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:50.139
Ma'am, I'm just trying
to turn a buck here, that's all.


855
01:06:50.224 --> 01:06:51.807
If there's a problem between you two,

856
01:06:51.934 --> 01:06:55.436
maybe you should talk to a priest
or whatever.


857
01:06:55.479 --> 01:06:56.896
Hash it out.

858
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:02.610
I can't fix your marriage, ma'am.

859
01:07:05.989 --> 01:07:08.157
I don't know,
I thought you might put in a word.


860
01:07:08.242 --> 01:07:10.993
- What do you suggest I say?
- He drops a hint to Zinnemann.


861
01:07:11.078 --> 01:07:12.536
That's how
these things work, you know.


862
01:07:12.621 --> 01:07:14.830
It was a very solid audition.

863
01:07:14.915 --> 01:07:17.917
It's Harry Cohn's picture.
Eddie's at MGM.


864
01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:21.212
Well, what ever happened to honour
among thieves?


865
01:07:21.296 --> 01:07:23.464
Let's just save it
for something important.


866
01:07:23.548 --> 01:07:26.592
Oh, I see.
This isn't important at all. Wow.


867
01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:33.975
Here.

868
01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:37.353
Because you've had a rough week.

869
01:07:41.024 --> 01:07:44.277
Well, who needs another watch?

870
01:07:45.112 --> 01:07:48.197
I just don't want some drunk finishing
what that horrid child started.


871
01:07:48.282 --> 01:07:49.782
I don't know that
a gun is the answer.

872
01:07:49.866 --> 01:07:51.701
It would just make me feel
more comfortable knowing...


873
01:07:51.785 --> 01:07:54.495
What would make me feel safe
is not prancing around in a monkey suit


874
01:07:54.579 --> 01:07:56.455
in front of 8,000 screaming...

875
01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.709
You'd be gone, 
George, all right?

876
01:07:59.835 --> 01:08:01.961
And then what happens to me?

877
01:08:10.721 --> 01:08:12.221
Mrs Mannix, please.

878
01:08:12.347 --> 01:08:13.889
Who shall I say is calling?

879
01:08:14.016 --> 01:08:17.268
Lawrence Farmer,
from the St. Jude's Foundation.


880
01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:20.813
- To thank her for her generosity.
- One moment, please.


881
01:08:47.549 --> 01:08:48.758
Mr Simo.

882
01:08:53.597 --> 01:08:55.514
- Do I know you?
- No.


883
01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.184
But I'm familiar with you.

884
01:08:58.268 --> 01:09:00.603
Everybody reads the Times, huh?

885
01:09:01.688 --> 01:09:04.982
I'm Howard Strickling.
I handle publicity at MGM.


886
01:09:05.067 --> 01:09:06.359
How do you do?

887
01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:08.444
And I'm wondering
why you would be trying


888
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:11.072
to approach Mrs Mannix
under false pretences.


889
01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:12.615
Are you speaking professionally?

890
01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:15.117
I'm speaking
as a friend of the Mannixs.


891
01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.079
- Can I see Mrs Mannix?
- She's not well.


892
01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:19.663
And frankly,
neither she nor her husband


893
01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:21.624
appreciate being dragged
into this business.


894
01:09:21.666 --> 01:09:24.835
- What business is that?
- Your business, Mr Simo.


895
01:09:30.467 --> 01:09:32.176
You didn't have to go and do that.

896
01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:35.513
You seem to have an inflated sense
of your importance.


897
01:09:35.597 --> 01:09:37.681
They're on routine patrol.

898
01:09:48.193 --> 01:09:52.196
Could you pass along a message
to Mrs Mannix?


899
01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:54.198
And what would that be?

900
01:09:56.535 --> 01:09:58.869
Hope to see her at the funeral.

901
01:10:14.636 --> 01:10:19.140
Art! Where's the boy?
I've been hunting all over.


902
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:21.517
He's over there.

903
01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:25.813
Zinnemann sure did keep us hanging
long enough.


904
01:10:25.856 --> 01:10:28.065
But I knew it would pan out.

905
01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:31.277
- How did you know that?
- What choice did I have?


906
01:10:33.363 --> 01:10:36.866
And, Toni, thank you.

907
01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.451
For what?

908
01:10:39.786 --> 01:10:42.413
Whatever you did to help.

909
01:10:42.914 --> 01:10:45.374
You know how much he needed this.

910
01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:51.505
Hi, George.

911
01:10:51.548 --> 01:10:53.883
- Hello.
- Hi.


912
01:11:01.892 --> 01:11:05.811
Mr Weissman?
I don't want to disturb you, but I...


913
01:11:05.896 --> 01:11:08.898
- You knew George?
- No.


914
01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:13.486
- I'm Louis Simo. I'm a...
- I'm no speechmaker.


915
01:11:14.321 --> 01:11:17.948
Saying what you really feel, it's hard.

916
01:11:19.618 --> 01:11:21.410
Thank you for coming.

917
01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:25.748
Mr Weissman,
I was just wondering if you...


918
01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:31.253
Seeing me off the grounds again?

919
01:11:31.296 --> 01:11:33.214
Mrs Mannix was unable to attend.

920
01:11:33.256 --> 01:11:35.799
For reasons
I'm sure you can understand.


921
01:11:35.926 --> 01:11:38.135
You do a lot for your friends.

922
01:11:40.597 --> 01:11:44.266
And you're just doing your job.
But I am concerned.


923
01:11:44.518 --> 01:11:46.894
- Yeah? About what?
- Your history.


924
01:11:46.978 --> 01:11:50.523
People are rarely afforded the chance
to make the same mistake twice.


925
01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:53.651
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm offering you an opportunity.


926
01:11:54.444 --> 01:11:57.947
There's a place for you at Metro
if you'd like. The pay can be generous.


927
01:11:58.073 --> 01:12:00.866
- I'd rather talk to Mrs Mannix.
- There's nothing there for you.


928
01:12:00.951 --> 01:12:03.661
Yeah? Then why are you pitching me?

929
01:12:03.787 --> 01:12:08.123
When it comes to publicity, what's
true or false really doesn't matter.


930
01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:12.336
If it hurts the studio, if it stops
one person from buying a ticket,


931
01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:15.381
I have to fix it. 
That's my job.

932
01:12:16.716 --> 01:12:18.509
The offer's sincere.

933
01:12:18.635 --> 01:12:22.137
Don't let pride stand in the way.
It won't get you what you want.


934
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.602
Sad day, huh, boys?
Tell you what's sadder.


935
01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:31.397
Calling it suicide
when it's really murder.


936
01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:32.982
Now why would the cops do that?

937
01:12:33.066 --> 01:12:36.819
- Sing us a new song, Simo.
- What, you don't love me any more?


938
01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.821
Two months ago, somebody drained

939
01:12:38.947 --> 01:12:41.490
all the fluid
out of George Reeves' brake line.


940
01:12:41.533 --> 01:12:44.660
Almost bought it right then.
Coincidence, right?


941
01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:48.706
I mean, LAPD don't make mistakes.
Huh, Paterson?


942
01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:51.000
What's the truth, huh, boys?

943
01:12:51.042 --> 01:12:52.501
Who wanted him dead?

944
01:12:52.586 --> 01:12:54.378
You guys might be lazy,
but nobody said you're dumb.


945
01:12:54.462 --> 01:12:56.755
- Give me that.
- Name some names.


946
01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.717
- You want me to write it for you, too?
- Hey, you got a story or not?


947
01:12:59.801 --> 01:13:02.678
You want names? Ask this guy.

948
01:13:03.346 --> 01:13:06.682
He's got the names.
The names, pictures.


949
01:13:06.808 --> 01:13:10.019
What's he doing here when MGM
never cut Reeves a cheque in his life?


950
01:13:10.103 --> 01:13:12.354
Huh? Come on,
do some work, will you?


951
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.065
Hey, Capa,
lift the fucking camera, will you.


952
01:13:17.027 --> 01:13:19.194
There you go. Say, "Cheese."

953
01:13:29.998 --> 01:13:31.624
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.


954
01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:35.336
- Hi, Bobby.
- Hi, Bobby. Good to see you.


955
01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:36.545
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck.


956
01:13:36.671 --> 01:13:39.173
How you doing, kid? 
Good to see you.

957
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:04.573
Well, buddy, they love it so far.

958
01:14:08.078 --> 01:14:10.704
You got any prejudices against girls?

959
01:14:12.832 --> 01:14:14.750
That's what I thought.

960
01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.588
Well, now, it looks like
you're all primed for a big night, Tom.


961
01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:21.423
- Hello, Stark.
- Want some company?


962
01:14:21.466 --> 01:14:22.966
No, thanks, all tied up.

963
01:14:23.093 --> 01:14:24.760
Leva tells me you've been
eyeing the Captain's wife


964
01:14:24.886 --> 01:14:27.096
- like a hound dog at hunting time.
- He has, huh?


965
01:14:27.138 --> 01:14:28.931
<i>Superman.</i>

966
01:14:28.973 --> 01:14:31.308
Took up with a lot of men
back there at Fort Bliss.


967
01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:33.352
Well, I wouldn't put stock
in stories like that.


968
01:14:33.436 --> 01:14:34.937
This ain't no story.

969
01:14:35.021 --> 01:14:37.272
Look up on the screen!

970
01:14:37.357 --> 01:14:39.233
Not for long, though.

971
01:14:39.317 --> 01:14:41.694
More powerful than a locomotive!

972
01:14:44.197 --> 01:14:45.781
People can see you.

973
01:14:45.907 --> 01:14:48.117
Faster than a speeding bullet.

974
01:14:48.785 --> 01:14:50.786
Hey, where's Lois Lane?

975
01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:52.621
Hello.

976
01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:54.456
I didn't think you were coming.

977
01:14:54.499 --> 01:14:56.083
Why not? I ain't late.

978
01:15:15.562 --> 01:15:18.272
I'll always take care of my boy.

979
01:15:35.206 --> 01:15:36.832
Nice shot, Louie.

980
01:15:52.182 --> 01:15:53.265
Kit?

981
01:16:02.066 --> 01:16:03.567
You listening?

982
01:16:04.652 --> 01:16:06.028
Get the fuck out of my house!

983
01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:10.365
Are you listening? 
Nod your head.

984
01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:21.543
Be smart. Let it go.

985
01:16:22.962 --> 01:16:26.048
What, your mother's snatch?
She won't let me.


986
01:16:26.132 --> 01:16:27.883
Here's what I mean.

987
01:16:40.271 --> 01:16:42.564
Louis? Louis?

988
01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:47.569
Louis, can you hear me? Louis?

989
01:16:51.908 --> 01:16:55.994
- I'm calling a doctor, all right?
- I don't wanna go to the doctor.


990
01:16:56.079 --> 01:16:58.080
Well, at least some ice.

991
01:16:59.123 --> 01:17:00.999
There's no ice in the fridge.

992
01:17:01.084 --> 01:17:04.419
Stop being stubborn, all right?
You were unconscious.


993
01:17:04.754 --> 01:17:08.131
There's no ice. 
What did you say?

994
01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:10.467
There's no ice.

995
01:17:16.808 --> 01:17:18.100
Sit down.

996
01:17:24.816 --> 01:17:26.483
What's this about?

997
01:17:32.657 --> 01:17:35.450
This murder bullshit I've been slinging.

998
01:17:36.911 --> 01:17:38.912
I think it might be true.

999
01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:42.666
I can help.
Oh, come on, you know I can.


1000
01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:45.294
Kit, let's call it a day, all right?

1001
01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:47.796
- What?
- You shouldn't be around me.


1002
01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:51.174
This isn't some TV show
you wanna be in.


1003
01:17:51.301 --> 01:17:54.636
This is just a fucked-up little business.

1004
01:17:54.721 --> 01:17:57.890
It makes you go around,
and you find out how shitty people are


1005
01:17:57.974 --> 01:17:59.474
to make the rent.

1006
01:17:59.559 --> 01:18:02.477
You don't really believe that.
I know you care about what you do.


1007
01:18:02.562 --> 01:18:04.855
You know what I care about?

1008
01:18:04.939 --> 01:18:09.401
That you're balling this Chad kid
and you don't got the guts to tell me.


1009
01:18:14.824 --> 01:18:15.949
Well, I was...

1010
01:18:15.992 --> 01:18:18.660
Going to. Yeah.
So, now you don't have to.


1011
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.501
Do you want me here today?

1012
01:18:27.211 --> 01:18:29.212
No, I don't think I do.

1013
01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:20.389
Let's go outside.

1014
01:19:25.269 --> 01:19:28.605
- You packing?
- Not when I cross the street for lunch.


1015
01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:30.607
Lou, I do what I'm told.

1016
01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:35.362
You took the cash from that rag,
same as me!


1017
01:19:35.446 --> 01:19:37.781
$2,500 for ratting on
some hop-head actress


1018
01:19:37.865 --> 01:19:39.241
and I never said a word!

1019
01:19:39.325 --> 01:19:42.411
'Cause I'm loyal!
To my fucking partner!


1020
01:19:43.663 --> 01:19:44.997
- Rick.
- Why?


1021
01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:48.417
- Didn't say. Just, "Take care of it."
- You tell me why!


1022
01:19:49.335 --> 01:19:53.463
Look, when I helped you out
with the old lady,


1023
01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:56.425
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I had to make good.


1024
01:19:56.467 --> 01:19:58.760
You would have done the same thing,
don't bullshit me!


1025
01:19:58.803 --> 01:20:01.263
That's how the mortgage gets paid!

1026
01:21:06.621 --> 01:21:07.704
What?

1027
01:21:08.664 --> 01:21:09.915
Mr Simo.

1028
01:21:10.374 --> 01:21:11.875
Mr Sinclair?

1029
01:21:12.752 --> 01:21:14.419
You have to stop, okay, 
I'm not gonna...

1030
01:21:14.504 --> 01:21:16.505
I need your help.

1031
01:21:17.715 --> 01:21:19.216
Things are...

1032
01:21:22.136 --> 01:21:24.262
They're not what they seem.

1033
01:21:25.556 --> 01:21:28.683
- What are you saying?
- I've misjudged terribly.


1034
01:21:29.852 --> 01:21:31.019
And...

1035
01:21:31.896 --> 01:21:35.524
Can you meet with me, Mr Simo?
I won't bother you again.


1036
01:21:38.111 --> 01:21:39.361
Please.

1037
01:21:40.071 --> 01:21:41.613
Meet you where?

1038
01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:52.934
What are you doing here?

1039
01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:55.812
I... My client...

1040
01:22:55.897 --> 01:22:57.689
She was your client?

1041
01:23:02.278 --> 01:23:04.154
Shot her in the throat,

1042
01:23:04.947 --> 01:23:06.156
the heart

1043
01:23:07.742 --> 01:23:09.159
and then the vagina.

1044
01:23:09.285 --> 01:23:10.493
Mr Simo.

1045
01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:13.955
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1046
01:23:13.998 --> 01:23:17.000
I do wish you'd been prompt.
I suppose the fault is mine


1047
01:23:17.126 --> 01:23:20.295
for failing to see that you and
your whore were not aiding me,


1048
01:23:20.379 --> 01:23:23.548
but guarding the rampant fornications
of my wife.


1049
01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.843
I hope you've learnt the meaning
of justice.


1050
01:23:26.928 --> 01:23:28.178
Come on.

1051
01:23:37.021 --> 01:23:38.688
This one's easier

1052
01:23:40.983 --> 01:23:42.859
than your other murder.

1053
01:23:59.085 --> 01:24:01.127
So, what's the emergency?

1054
01:24:02.213 --> 01:24:03.922
Better have a drink, Art.

1055
01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:07.175
It's 10:30 in the morning. What?

1056
01:24:08.511 --> 01:24:11.054
- It's pretty bad.
- What is?


1057
01:24:12.556 --> 01:24:15.058
Enough, George. 
Let's deal with it.

1058
01:24:16.727 --> 01:24:18.353
We're cancelled.

1059
01:24:25.903 --> 01:24:27.570
I just don't see the point.

1060
01:24:27.655 --> 01:24:30.407
The point
is it's my production company.


1061
01:24:30.491 --> 01:24:32.158
If I don't sell myself, who will?

1062
01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:36.454
- The business is here, George.
- Yes, but the money's in New York.


1063
01:24:36.539 --> 01:24:38.873
I can get in the papers there.

1064
01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:41.710
- It's a lot of bother.
- I want to do this.


1065
01:24:41.752 --> 01:24:44.713
I'm looking forward to it.
I'll take charge of my own life.


1066
01:24:44.755 --> 01:24:47.966
- I see.
- No, you don't.


1067
01:24:48.592 --> 01:24:50.719
You think I should just sit around here,
doing God knows what,


1068
01:24:50.761 --> 01:24:53.096
- while the both of us...
- Yes?


1069
01:24:53.222 --> 01:24:54.931
While the both of us what?

1070
01:24:55.016 --> 01:24:58.226
My love, this makes sense to me.

1071
01:24:59.395 --> 01:25:03.481
I can set up my own projects.
Direct and produce and...


1072
01:25:03.566 --> 01:25:07.193
We'll get some other sap
to jump around in coloured underwear.


1073
01:25:07.278 --> 01:25:10.363
Who knows,
maybe I'll direct a picture for MGM.


1074
01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.243
I'll be back in two weeks.

1075
01:25:17.455 --> 01:25:18.747
Kiss me.

1076
01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:21.624
- Let me close this.
- You have to.


1077
01:25:25.796 --> 01:25:27.047
Kiss me.

1078
01:25:28.799 --> 01:25:30.592
I have to go. Toni...

1079
01:25:30.676 --> 01:25:32.260
- George, kiss me.
- All right.


1080
01:25:35.014 --> 01:25:36.348
All right.

1081
01:25:56.702 --> 01:25:57.786
Shit.

1082
01:25:57.870 --> 01:26:00.455
That bitch who hired you,
you think she loved Georgie?


1083
01:26:00.539 --> 01:26:03.333
- Who is this?
- He grew up without a father.


1084
01:26:03.417 --> 01:26:07.545
When he's old enough, she finally
tells him what happened to Daddy.


1085
01:26:07.630 --> 01:26:09.464
- Miss Lemmon?
- Suicide.


1086
01:26:09.548 --> 01:26:12.509
Pistol in the mouth. Georgie
never stopped thinking about it.


1087
01:26:12.593 --> 01:26:16.930
Fifteen years later, he gets a visitor.
His father, alive.


1088
01:26:17.348 --> 01:26:20.934
All he'd done was dump the bitch
for another woman. Left Georgie, too.


1089
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:24.687
So Mommy tells baby,
"Daddy killed himself."


1090
01:26:24.814 --> 01:26:26.689
She tells her own son.

1091
01:26:26.816 --> 01:26:29.692
Georgie swore
he'd never speak to her again.


1092
01:26:30.861 --> 01:26:32.612
This lets you off the hook?

1093
01:26:32.696 --> 01:26:35.698
I didn't screw his head on backwards,
she did.


1094
01:26:37.034 --> 01:26:39.160
Why are you telling me now?

1095
01:26:41.997 --> 01:26:43.206
I'm...

1096
01:26:43.874 --> 01:26:46.251
I'm just a little blotto, sugar.

1097
01:26:47.962 --> 01:26:49.462
Kind of horny.

1098
01:26:51.006 --> 01:26:53.216
And pretty goddamn all alone.

1099
01:26:53.676 --> 01:26:55.718
- So...
- I don't know.


1100
01:26:57.513 --> 01:27:00.557
And I thought maybe
we had something in common.


1101
01:27:31.881 --> 01:27:33.298
Mrs Bessolo?

1102
01:27:44.185 --> 01:27:45.643
Mrs Bessolo.

1103
01:27:47.021 --> 01:27:48.521
Mrs Bessolo!

1104
01:27:52.443 --> 01:27:56.196
I won't be needing your services
any longer, Mr Simo.


1105
01:27:56.238 --> 01:27:59.741
- And when were you going to tell me?
- I intend to mail you a cheque.


1106
01:27:59.783 --> 01:28:02.619
A cheque? That's it?

1107
01:28:02.745 --> 01:28:04.496
I don't owe you anything else.

1108
01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:06.331
How about an explanation?

1109
01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:08.958
How about telling me your son
wouldn't give you the time of day?


1110
01:28:09.043 --> 01:28:11.377
Don't you use that tone with me!

1111
01:28:13.047 --> 01:28:15.757
- Mr Strickling gave me his word.
- Strickling?


1112
01:28:15.841 --> 01:28:17.634
A statue would be erected...

1113
01:28:17.718 --> 01:28:19.469
- A what?
- ...in my son's honour,


1114
01:28:19.553 --> 01:28:21.679
outside the Chinese Theatre.

1115
01:28:23.516 --> 01:28:26.309
You never gave a shit, did you?

1116
01:28:26.435 --> 01:28:27.977
You'll be paid.

1117
01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:30.772
Keep your goddamn cheque.

1118
01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:33.191
My son was a great star.

1119
01:28:34.276 --> 01:28:36.319
He deserves a statue.

1120
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:49.415
- Can I take your picture?
- Sure.


1121
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:52.710
- Wait, wait. I blinked, take another one.
- Sorry, no retakes.


1122
01:28:52.795 --> 01:28:54.921
My goddamn eyes were closed.

1123
01:28:57.967 --> 01:29:00.343
- You know who that is over there?
- Can I take your picture?


1124
01:29:00.469 --> 01:29:01.678
Superman.

1125
01:29:03.347 --> 01:29:06.683
Right. He's got to be loaded.

1126
01:29:06.809 --> 01:29:10.019
You know, my little cousins
are glued to that show.


1127
01:29:13.816 --> 01:29:15.400
Look at her ass.

1128
01:29:15.859 --> 01:29:17.235
Len, look.

1129
01:29:21.865 --> 01:29:23.575
What's really exciting to me...

1130
01:29:23.659 --> 01:29:25.201
Earl Wilson.

1131
01:29:25.286 --> 01:29:28.830
Look at you all dressed up.
I haven't seen you since...


1132
01:29:28.956 --> 01:29:31.666
You punched a waiter at Sardi's
and broke his nose.


1133
01:29:31.792 --> 01:29:33.459
I left a nice tip.

1134
01:29:36.005 --> 01:29:38.423
- Find something funny, junior?
- No, no, no.


1135
01:29:38.507 --> 01:29:41.718
- I know when I'm out of my league.
- Don't sell yourself short.


1136
01:29:41.844 --> 01:29:43.511
I got a big heart.

1137
01:29:43.554 --> 01:29:46.055
I'll bet you've got a big one, too.

1138
01:29:48.267 --> 01:29:51.019
That's very nice of you to say, Miss...

1139
01:29:51.812 --> 01:29:54.564
- Leonore Lemmon.
- Miss Lemmon.


1140
01:29:55.566 --> 01:29:59.819
So, how about an autograph
for my poor crippled nephew?


1141
01:29:59.903 --> 01:30:02.780
- Is he in an iron lung?
- He's in Yonkers.


1142
01:30:10.581 --> 01:30:12.749
Superman wants to get laid.

1143
01:30:27.431 --> 01:30:28.723
God damn!

1144
01:30:29.183 --> 01:30:31.434
Make room for fucking Daddy!

1145
01:30:33.228 --> 01:30:35.438
- You know what, stallion?
- What?


1146
01:30:35.522 --> 01:30:38.650
I think you're starting to
get the hang of this.


1147
01:30:41.362 --> 01:30:43.029
Let's do it again.

1148
01:31:01.173 --> 01:31:02.548
Hey, Scout.

1149
01:31:03.258 --> 01:31:06.761
- Mom's picking me up.
- I know that. I just wanted to...


1150
01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:09.722
I got you something.

1151
01:31:14.895 --> 01:31:16.771
I left it in the car.

1152
01:31:16.897 --> 01:31:19.899
I'll give it to you when we go home.
Come on. Let's go.


1153
01:31:22.194 --> 01:31:24.362
How come you're not at work?

1154
01:31:25.447 --> 01:31:29.409
'Cause I don't sit in an office, okay?
That's for suckers.


1155
01:31:29.493 --> 01:31:32.453
Your pop's an investigator, all right?

1156
01:31:32.871 --> 01:31:34.706
Come on, let's go.

1157
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:37.041
I'm supposed to wait for Mom.

1158
01:31:38.001 --> 01:31:41.504
- What?
- I'm supposed to wait for Mom.


1159
01:31:48.595 --> 01:31:50.847
Your mom and me, we don't...

1160
01:31:55.227 --> 01:31:56.352
Evan.

1161
01:31:58.397 --> 01:31:59.522
Evan.

1162
01:32:01.817 --> 01:32:03.735
Nobody has magic powers.

1163
01:32:04.611 --> 01:32:06.404
You got to be tough.

1164
01:32:08.407 --> 01:32:11.534
You got to show them
what you're made of, you know?


1165
01:32:11.618 --> 01:32:13.911
My father never taught me that.

1166
01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:19.083
Okay, here we go. Come on.

1167
01:32:25.299 --> 01:32:26.507
I'm fine.

1168
01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:35.349
I'm his son. He's my son, he is.

1169
01:32:36.685 --> 01:32:38.436
Tell him, Scout. 
Just tell him.

1170
01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:40.772
Evan, tell him, please. Come on.

1171
01:32:40.856 --> 01:32:42.398
Evan. Evan.

1172
01:32:46.695 --> 01:32:48.696
Honey, what's the matter?

1173
01:32:49.907 --> 01:32:51.240
Oh, Jesus.

1174
01:32:52.451 --> 01:32:55.286
- Could you take him... Just take him...
- Sure.


1175
01:33:14.431 --> 01:33:16.974
Whatever you want to say, you know.

1176
01:33:18.352 --> 01:33:20.812
Are you going to fight everybody?

1177
01:33:21.647 --> 01:33:23.981
I thought you liked tough guys.

1178
01:33:39.456 --> 01:33:42.834
- You're saying this why?
- I want to be honest with you.


1179
01:33:42.918 --> 01:33:44.585
My, that's noble.

1180
01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:48.840
What is that, from some script
you auditioned for in the '40s?


1181
01:33:48.924 --> 01:33:51.342
No. It's just me, talking to you.

1182
01:33:51.802 --> 01:33:53.427
I'm so grateful.

1183
01:33:53.846 --> 01:33:55.221
Straight arrow George!

1184
01:33:55.305 --> 01:33:57.223
You go to New York,
and you fuck some whore,


1185
01:33:57.307 --> 01:33:58.599
and you run back to tell me!

1186
01:33:58.684 --> 01:34:00.434
She's not a whore.

1187
01:34:00.519 --> 01:34:03.312
She's an actress. A singer?

1188
01:34:04.022 --> 01:34:06.774
Does she blow smoke rings
with her cunt?


1189
01:34:08.777 --> 01:34:10.611
Is it a fling you want?

1190
01:34:10.654 --> 01:34:13.281
- It's not a fling.
- Oh, you're in love!


1191
01:34:14.116 --> 01:34:17.493
- Two weeks in a hotel room?
- She makes me feel young.


1192
01:34:20.789 --> 01:34:23.082
Have you seen yourself, George?

1193
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:26.043
- Your face is going.
- Don't do this.


1194
01:34:26.128 --> 01:34:27.628
Here, your eyes, your hair,
your stomach.


1195
01:34:27.713 --> 01:34:28.880
Stop it.

1196
01:34:28.964 --> 01:34:30.548
- You think no one notices?
- Toni, don't do this.


1197
01:34:30.632 --> 01:34:32.383
But you've got your projects,
haven't you?


1198
01:34:32.467 --> 01:34:34.176
You're going to be a director.

1199
01:34:34.261 --> 01:34:36.888
You'll sit in your little canvas chair,
polishing your balls.


1200
01:34:36.972 --> 01:34:38.764
Thank God I'm rid of that hag
I had to screw.


1201
01:34:38.807 --> 01:34:40.641
What was her name?
The one who paid for everything!


1202
01:34:40.767 --> 01:34:42.310
The one who
bought me a fucking house!


1203
01:34:42.394 --> 01:34:43.477
For God's sake!

1204
01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.148
You want publicity?
You'll get it. I'll say you're a Red.


1205
01:34:47.524 --> 01:34:50.318
And a faggot. A lush.
Nobody can call that a lie.


1206
01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:52.820
You know what? You've never
helped me. You never helped me!


1207
01:34:52.863 --> 01:34:53.988
You could've talked to Eddie.

1208
01:34:54.031 --> 01:34:55.740
You could've gotten me something,
but you didn't!


1209
01:34:55.824 --> 01:34:58.492
Because you liked me where I was,
in a fucking red suit!


1210
01:34:58.577 --> 01:35:01.078
You liked that! Well, that's not
who I am, you understand?


1211
01:35:01.163 --> 01:35:02.580
God damn you!

1212
01:35:03.457 --> 01:35:05.541
But, George, that's all
you were good for.


1213
01:35:05.626 --> 01:35:07.752
Ten-year-olds and shut-ins.

1214
01:35:08.086 --> 01:35:10.922
That was the best
you were ever going to be.


1215
01:35:11.006 --> 01:35:14.133
I knew that. Why didn't you?

1216
01:35:20.015 --> 01:35:23.517
They rushed it and closed the case.
I didn't like it from the start.


1217
01:35:23.602 --> 01:35:24.685
Why?

1218
01:35:28.023 --> 01:35:29.774
There was pressure.

1219
01:35:30.484 --> 01:35:32.234
Oh, yeah? From who?

1220
01:35:33.111 --> 01:35:36.280
Look, I can't do what you can do.
Understand?


1221
01:35:36.365 --> 01:35:40.326
I got a wife, kids, car payments.

1222
01:35:40.410 --> 01:35:44.121
- Look, I'm in for 20 and a pension.
- But I got nothing to lose, huh?


1223
01:35:44.206 --> 01:35:47.333
Look, think it through.
MGM buys off the mother.


1224
01:35:47.376 --> 01:35:49.460
I'm not getting paid, pal.

1225
01:35:49.878 --> 01:35:52.505
- That's all it's about for you.
- Hey.


1226
01:35:55.676 --> 01:35:58.970
I got that woman killed.
For nothing, okay?


1227
01:35:59.054 --> 01:36:01.138
Fifty bucks a day,
I'm stringing her husband along


1228
01:36:01.223 --> 01:36:04.392
like I'm running him 'cause
I can't see straight in front of me.


1229
01:36:04.434 --> 01:36:06.727
No. I'm done.

1230
01:36:06.812 --> 01:36:09.480
Look, this is how they work
and it just gets buried.


1231
01:36:09.564 --> 01:36:12.149
Don't you want to know about this guy?

1232
01:36:12.234 --> 01:36:15.319
Why don't you get on the right side
of something for once?


1233
01:36:15.404 --> 01:36:18.280
Where do you come off
telling me what I should do?


1234
01:36:18.365 --> 01:36:21.492
Well, I'm not the one
with the guilty conscience, am I?


1235
01:38:09.184 --> 01:38:13.354
- Who wants me to wrestle?
- Professional circuit. They're serious.


1236
01:38:14.272 --> 01:38:16.607
You might get a kick out of it.

1237
01:38:17.067 --> 01:38:18.442
What do you got, a party?

1238
01:38:18.527 --> 01:38:21.779
No. Just a few friends
of Leonore's making a racket.


1239
01:38:21.863 --> 01:38:24.782
So now when that old bitch calls,
this gizmo records it automatically.


1240
01:38:24.866 --> 01:38:27.118
- So at least the cops believe us.
- I got a delivery for Mr Reeves.


1241
01:38:27.202 --> 01:38:29.203
Hey, in there! Excuse me.

1242
01:38:29.788 --> 01:38:30.955
Sorry.

1243
01:38:32.916 --> 01:38:34.750
Put that on the table.

1244
01:38:35.794 --> 01:38:38.629
Georgie, why don't you show this boy
how much we love him?


1245
01:38:38.713 --> 01:38:39.797
All right.

1246
01:38:39.881 --> 01:38:42.716
Why don't we take it easy
on this batch, Len?


1247
01:38:46.096 --> 01:38:49.473
All right, kid, here's $100.
Go make your first million.


1248
01:38:49.558 --> 01:38:52.601
Georgie, you are directing
your own movie in a month.


1249
01:38:52.727 --> 01:38:54.311
Live a little, okay?
Or take a headache pill.


1250
01:38:54.396 --> 01:38:56.313
- Just don't ruin the party, okay?
- All right.


1251
01:38:56.398 --> 01:38:59.483
Give me a kiss. Go. Go on.

1252
01:38:59.568 --> 01:39:02.236
All right, all right.
I'll fix you a drink, all right?


1253
01:39:45.363 --> 01:39:46.530
Yeah?

1254
01:39:47.032 --> 01:39:48.490
That actor...

1255
01:39:49.034 --> 01:39:52.620
Eddie, it's very late.

1256
01:39:53.079 --> 01:39:56.123
What's he plan to do
with the rest of his life?


1257
01:39:56.249 --> 01:40:00.878
He has some spaceman script set up
with Wasserman.


1258
01:40:01.713 --> 01:40:02.880
To direct.

1259
01:40:02.964 --> 01:40:04.381
If you offered some kind of...

1260
01:40:04.466 --> 01:40:06.967
Yeah, yeah. I know how to handle it.

1261
01:40:21.691 --> 01:40:23.317
Well, all right.

1262
01:40:24.736 --> 01:40:26.070
Very nice.

1263
01:40:26.947 --> 01:40:29.156
Thank you. You're very kind.

1264
01:40:29.783 --> 01:40:33.202
What did you think,
my sweetest dream? Moved to tears?


1265
01:40:33.328 --> 01:40:36.205
I thought you sounded
like a goddamn beaner.


1266
01:40:36.665 --> 01:40:38.666
Well, and so good night.

1267
01:40:58.353 --> 01:40:59.436
Hey!

1268
01:41:21.293 --> 01:41:24.962
Universal is not the only studio.
Get him in the door someplace else.


1269
01:41:25.046 --> 01:41:27.089
- I already tried.
- Try harder.


1270
01:41:27.173 --> 01:41:29.341
He's your only client.
What kind of bullshit agent are you?


1271
01:41:29.426 --> 01:41:30.759
- Leonore.
- You come around here,


1272
01:41:30.844 --> 01:41:32.386
dragging around
like a wet goddamn dog!


1273
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:34.054
Leonore, stop it!

1274
01:41:36.391 --> 01:41:39.184
Art, we talked about this.

1275
01:41:39.853 --> 01:41:42.479
This picture's important. Or it was.

1276
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:46.817
These people don't want me.
They don't know what I can do.


1277
01:41:46.901 --> 01:41:50.112
And we got to show it to them, show
them I can do something different.


1278
01:41:50.196 --> 01:41:52.906
We got to cook something up
for me now.


1279
01:41:53.533 --> 01:41:55.326
The wrestling offer.

1280
01:41:58.580 --> 01:41:59.913
Does it pay?

1281
01:41:59.998 --> 01:42:05.044
Their only concern,
are you up to it physically?


1282
01:42:08.423 --> 01:42:10.049
Well, we'll...

1283
01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:13.385
You can film me, so they can see.

1284
01:42:13.428 --> 01:42:16.263
Why don't you just join
the goddamn circus?


1285
01:42:59.057 --> 01:43:00.724
How are you doing?

1286
01:43:32.048 --> 01:43:33.424
Mrs Mannix?

1287
01:43:35.802 --> 01:43:37.803
I'll just put it on the bed.

1288
01:44:03.288 --> 01:44:04.705
Mrs Mannix?

1289
01:44:11.129 --> 01:44:13.422
Mrs Mannix, can I talk to you?

1290
01:44:13.506 --> 01:44:15.174
It's about George.

1291
01:44:19.804 --> 01:44:23.474
George shot himself.

1292
01:44:24.309 --> 01:44:25.893
He was shot.

1293
01:44:26.769 --> 01:44:29.480
Someone shot him,
is that what you mean?


1294
01:44:29.731 --> 01:44:31.231
Who did that?

1295
01:44:33.693 --> 01:44:35.068
Mrs Mannix.

1296
01:44:36.738 --> 01:44:38.906
Can you help me understand?

1297
01:44:40.492 --> 01:44:42.242
Will you please help me?

1298
01:44:42.285 --> 01:44:44.077
Did you know George?

1299
01:44:46.456 --> 01:44:48.790
Why don't you tell me about him?

1300
01:44:49.542 --> 01:44:53.712
He really was the most beautiful boy.

1301
01:44:54.088 --> 01:44:56.089
Mrs Mannix, please,
if I could just come in.


1302
01:44:56.174 --> 01:44:58.091
You're not invited, Simo.

1303
01:45:00.762 --> 01:45:02.971
- Were you?
- We're working.


1304
01:45:03.056 --> 01:45:04.264
Come on.

1305
01:45:10.313 --> 01:45:12.189
Why don't you lay off?

1306
01:45:15.610 --> 01:45:18.362
- Mr Harris.
- Hello, Louis.


1307
01:45:18.446 --> 01:45:21.365
You come up from Palos Verdes
just to see me?


1308
01:45:21.449 --> 01:45:24.576
I came here
to celebrate my friends' anniversary.


1309
01:45:25.286 --> 01:45:29.498
- You've met Mr Mannix.
- No, but we got people in common.


1310
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.709
Ain't that right, Eddie?

1311
01:45:32.794 --> 01:45:35.337
I've got nothing in common with you.

1312
01:45:38.216 --> 01:45:40.592
Bernice, the first missus.

1313
01:45:41.636 --> 01:45:44.429
You like that car crash gimmick, huh?

1314
01:45:44.472 --> 01:45:46.306
- Rick...
- Riva Watson.


1315
01:45:47.642 --> 01:45:49.643
She get all clingy?

1316
01:45:49.686 --> 01:45:51.812
How'd it feel, pounding her face in?

1317
01:45:51.854 --> 01:45:54.314
- Happy times, huh, Ed?
- Richard, please.


1318
01:45:54.357 --> 01:45:56.316
- George Reeves...
- That's enough, Louis.


1319
01:45:56.359 --> 01:45:59.778
Am I being indiscreet?
Bad for business, huh?


1320
01:45:59.862 --> 01:46:02.447
- Louis, your problems are your own.
- Ricky, you cover for this prick?


1321
01:46:02.532 --> 01:46:04.157
Whatever you're pursuing here.
Whatever fantasy...


1322
01:46:04.242 --> 01:46:05.993
You had a bullet put in Reeves' head!

1323
01:46:06.077 --> 01:46:07.494
...you constructed
will not alter your past.


1324
01:46:07.579 --> 01:46:09.705
He used the studio and the cops...

1325
01:46:13.084 --> 01:46:15.836
You're going to burn in hell,
you son of a bitch!


1326
01:46:20.717 --> 01:46:22.134
Come here.

1327
01:46:25.930 --> 01:46:27.681
You don't know me.

1328
01:46:28.433 --> 01:46:31.268
You don't know what
I think. What I do.

1329
01:46:32.312 --> 01:46:33.645
I don't let you.

1330
01:46:33.730 --> 01:46:35.731
You're an old man, Eddie.

1331
01:46:36.441 --> 01:46:38.150
Who's going to wipe the blood
off your hands?


1332
01:46:38.234 --> 01:46:39.860
My hands?

1333
01:46:39.944 --> 01:46:42.029
I'm in the picture business.

1334
01:46:42.113 --> 01:46:43.989
No, you're a murderer.

1335
01:46:45.450 --> 01:46:46.700
Prove it.

1336
01:46:47.535 --> 01:46:51.538
You hear me? Go on, I'm ready.

1337
01:46:52.457 --> 01:46:54.833
Prove one fucking thing.

1338
01:47:04.927 --> 01:47:06.219
Oh, God.

1339
01:47:39.128 --> 01:47:42.255
People are waiting. 
You coming down?

1340
01:47:44.676 --> 01:47:46.802
- Help with the dress.
- Yeah.


1341
01:47:55.103 --> 01:47:56.228
Okay?

1342
01:47:58.981 --> 01:48:01.108
I'm gonna let some light in.

1343
01:48:14.956 --> 01:48:17.124
I want to tell you something.

1344
01:48:18.876 --> 01:48:21.545
You know I'll always take care of you.

1345
01:48:22.839 --> 01:48:24.756
Whatever's happened...

1346
01:48:26.759 --> 01:48:30.387
Whatever might have been done.
It doesn't matter.


1347
01:48:31.597 --> 01:48:33.724
Nobody's going to hurt you.

1348
01:48:35.518 --> 01:48:39.354
Nobody gets to ask. 
I won't allow it.

1349
01:48:40.982 --> 01:48:44.484
You're safe with me.
With your husband.


1350
01:48:48.156 --> 01:48:50.407
Let me see what you look like.

1351
01:49:03.921 --> 01:49:05.547
You're beautiful.

1352
01:49:09.802 --> 01:49:11.595
You always will be.

1353
01:49:18.019 --> 01:49:19.686
I see the pieces.

1354
01:49:21.105 --> 01:49:22.856
How they should fit.

1355
01:49:24.776 --> 01:49:26.693
How I want them to fit.

1356
01:49:29.197 --> 01:49:30.655
But I can't.

1357
01:49:39.207 --> 01:49:41.041
I looked in his face.

1358
01:49:42.251 --> 01:49:45.337
I know he could do it.
Wouldn't think about it twice.


1359
01:49:45.421 --> 01:49:47.506
- Eddie Mannix?
- Yeah.


1360
01:49:49.050 --> 01:49:51.885
No, I would never say
it wasn't possible.


1361
01:49:54.222 --> 01:49:56.139
What about Mrs Mannix?

1362
01:49:56.224 --> 01:49:58.809
You had to like her. 
Such brightness.

1363
01:49:59.894 --> 01:50:02.562
Could she have done
what you're saying?


1364
01:50:05.191 --> 01:50:07.317
I don't want to think that.

1365
01:50:08.152 --> 01:50:09.528
And Leonore?

1366
01:50:09.612 --> 01:50:12.364
We never got along. 
Leave it there.

1367
01:50:20.039 --> 01:50:21.414
Mr Reeves?

1368
01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:24.167
A charming man.

1369
01:50:26.587 --> 01:50:28.755
Funny. Handsome.

1370
01:50:29.757 --> 01:50:33.760
Not like the ones today.
All the squinting and the mumbling.


1371
01:50:33.803 --> 01:50:35.470
A movie-star face.

1372
01:50:38.266 --> 01:50:39.891
Why wasn't he one?

1373
01:50:42.937 --> 01:50:47.524
Where he wound up,
it should have been enough, right?


1374
01:50:48.651 --> 01:50:50.318
Enough for a life.

1375
01:50:52.238 --> 01:50:53.697
But George...

1376
01:50:57.785 --> 01:50:58.910
Yeah?

1377
01:51:08.129 --> 01:51:11.298
I never showed this.
I knew it wouldn't help.


1378
01:51:14.468 --> 01:51:15.927
You watch it.

1379
01:51:19.682 --> 01:51:21.516
Tell me what you see.

1380
01:54:02.887 --> 01:54:04.304
Good night.
