00:00:05.998 --> 00:00:09.343
(Water lapping)

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.520
(Birdsong)

00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:24.995
THE LEGEND OF THE HOLY DRINKER
a story by Joseph Roth


5
00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:56.529
(Ship's horn)

6
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:45.449
(Both speaking French)

7
00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:49.541
Where are you going, brother?

8
00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.672
Where am I going?

9
00:02:56.668 --> 00:02:58.261
Who knows?

10
00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.380
Oh, you're a foreigner?

11
00:03:00.505 --> 00:03:02.553
I could show you
the way if you like.

12
00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:08.146
It's God who has set you in my path.
I'm certain of it.


13
00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.360
And I have a great favor to ask you,
something very close to my heart.


14
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.942
(Clears throat)

15
00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:18.407
Are you asking me a favor?

16
00:03:18.523 --> 00:03:20.116
Me?

17
00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:23.612
Yes, and I know
that you are worthy of it.


18
00:03:25.947 --> 00:03:27.119
Ah.

19
00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.082
It will be my pleasure.

20
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.506
Don't take it badly, will you,
if I speak to you very frankly?


21
00:03:38.627 --> 00:03:40.470
I can't help seeing

22
00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:44.308
that, just for the moment,
you're in... you're in some difficulty,


23
00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:46.051
in need of money.

24
00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:55.193
Don't be offended. Please, no offence.
It can happen to anybody.


25
00:03:55.936 --> 00:04:00.988
Now, I have more money
than I need.


26
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.197
Please.

27
00:04:03.318 --> 00:04:05.412
Please, hm?

28
00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:10.376
Won't you tell me how much you want,
just t0 be going on with.


29
00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:12.165
Hm? Just tell me.

30
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.793
20 francs wouldn't be bad.

31
00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:18.133
You'll need more than that.

32
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.127
You'll need at least 200.

33
00:04:21.712 --> 00:04:23.635
200?

34
00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:26.383
200 francs, of course,
would be a lot better.


35
00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.307
- I can't accept it.
- Why not?


36
00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.604
Because I wouldn't know
how to pay back that kind of money.


37
00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:40.948
And you couldn't come after me
to ask for it.


38
00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:43.658
I haven't got a house.

39
00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:46.403
I sleep under the bridges.

40
00:04:46.528 --> 00:04:48.155
Every night under the bridge.

41
00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:51.040
So...

42
00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:55.003
But I'm a man of honor.

43
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.667
I know how to behave.

44
00:04:57.622 --> 00:05:00.091
I just don't have an address, that's all.

45
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.424
I have no address either.

46
00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:06.048
I can't even tell you
the name of a bank.

47
00:05:06.173 --> 00:05:08.926
No, do take this money.

48
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.348
There. Right. You see? There.

49
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.225
Ridiculous amount of money
in any case for a man like you.


50
00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.942
- But I...
- I know.


51
00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:19.811
I know you're a man of honor.

52
00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:24.320
So, when you're in a position
to repay the money,


53
00:05:25.317 --> 00:05:29.663
will you do me the favor
that I was speaking of?


54
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.202
You see...

55
00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:35.707
I must confide to you
something extraordinary.


56
00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:40.712
I read the story

57
00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:42.926
of little Thérése,

58
00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:45.922
the saint of Lisieux, hm?

59
00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:47.889
And ever since...

60
00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:51.222
I've been living a miracle.

61
00:05:51.343 --> 00:05:52.890
A real miracle.

62
00:05:53.678 --> 00:05:55.021
The miracle of conversion.

63
00:05:56.097 --> 00:06:00.147
And that's why I've decided
to come and live the life of the poor.


64
00:06:01.812 --> 00:06:06.113
To live like those who come
to spend the night under the bridges.


65
00:06:07.526 --> 00:06:12.828
Now, I'm particularly devoted
to the small statue of little Thérése.


66
00:06:12.948 --> 00:06:16.122
It's in the church
of Sainte-Marie des Batignolles.


67
00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:20.543
You can't miss it.
It's in the righthand nave.


68
00:06:20.664 --> 00:06:22.337
Along the wall.

69
00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.341
- Me?
- Yes, but don't...


70
00:06:26.461 --> 00:06:27.838
Don't worry.

71
00:06:27.963 --> 00:06:30.057
But as soon as you can.

72
00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:33.973
Yes, when you are in a position
to repay the money.


73
00:06:34.094 --> 00:06:38.770
That is, if your conscience
won't allow you to remain in debt.


74
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.234
Then... take the money

75
00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:44.275
and put it in the hands of the priest
at the end of Mass.


76
00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:50.702
Because if there is anyone
to whom you'll be in debt


77
00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.992
from this moment on,

78
00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:55.457
it is to little Thérése.

79
00:06:57.617 --> 00:06:59.915
So... don't forget.

80
00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:05.084
Don't forget the address of the saint.

81
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.711
Thank you.

82
00:07:10.547 --> 00:07:12.049
I give you my word.

83
00:07:13.425 --> 00:07:15.302
I will keep my word.

84
00:07:17.304 --> 00:07:20.148
I think it's best to go
on a Sunday, don't you?


85
00:07:20.265 --> 00:07:22.233
Sunday would be perfect.

86
00:07:25.228 --> 00:07:29.153
Well... it's been a great pleasure.

87
00:10:31.748 --> 00:10:35.218
Sainte... Thérése.

88
00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:41.929
Sainte
-Marie...

89
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:47.898
des Bati... gnolles.

90
00:11:02.237 --> 00:11:03.614
(Howling)

91
00:11:13.289 --> 00:11:14.632
I'm going to eat.

92
00:13:41.729 --> 00:13:43.777
(Man speaks French)

93
00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:38.809
(Ship's horn)

94
00:15:58.574 --> 00:16:01.373
(Both speaking French)

95
00:16:26.144 --> 00:16:27.361
(Woman speaks French)

96
00:16:31.232 --> 00:16:32.609
(Orders in French)

97
00:16:38.322 --> 00:16:40.950
(Both speaking French)

98
00:17:51.854 --> 00:17:53.902
(Both speaking French)

99
00:17:59.362 --> 00:18:01.114
I'll be right back.

100
00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:55.732
(Orders in French)

101
00:20:19.627 --> 00:20:21.049
(Speaks French)

102
00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:31.018
<i>- 10,11,12.
- Merci.</i>


103
00:20:49.532 --> 00:20:51.955
How would you like a job?

104
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:55.288
Tomorrow I have to move.

105
00:20:55.996 --> 00:20:58.499
You could make a little money.

106
00:20:59.709 --> 00:21:03.304
I already called a couple of movers,

107
00:21:03.421 --> 00:21:06.846
but my wife is in a state.

108
00:21:08.008 --> 00:21:11.182
She is worried
she won't get through with it.


109
00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:14.432
I've got the shop to mind.

110
00:21:14.557 --> 00:21:16.559
What about giving us a hand?

111
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.820
- Sure.
- It would be for a couple of days.


112
00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.865
- A couple of days.
- Tomorrow and Saturday.


113
00:21:31.282 --> 00:21:32.408
Yes, OK.

114
00:21:42.918 --> 00:21:45.842
Are 200 francs OK?

115
00:21:45.963 --> 00:21:49.433
- That's very nice.
- Is that all right with you?


116
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:53.975
- It's perfect.
- Then let's drink to it.


117
00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.062
I'll offer.

118
00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:01.275
Because today is really a fine day.

119
00:22:02.271 --> 00:22:04.194
It's Thursday.

120
00:22:04.315 --> 00:22:05.316
<i>Oui.</i>

121
00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:08.360
It's my birthday, more or less.

122
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.242
Oh, yes?

123
00:22:12.656 --> 00:22:14.078
More or less.

124
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.765
The next one's on me.
It's a question of honor.


125
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.354
One look at my hands will tell you.

126
00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:41.273
- But I am also a gentleman.
- I believe it.


127
00:22:42.436 --> 00:22:45.406
Here's my calling card.
It's from the shop.


128
00:22:46.315 --> 00:22:48.488
I'll write the house address here.

129
00:23:03.499 --> 00:23:05.251
- What are you doing?
- It's my turn.


130
00:23:06.126 --> 00:23:08.128
We agreed.

131
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:21.601
Take this on account
so you'll come tomorrow for sure.


132
00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:25.438
And when the job's done
I'll give you the rest.


133
00:23:25.563 --> 00:23:27.406
And we'll lift glasses again.

134
00:23:31.235 --> 00:23:34.535
But now, dear friend,
I have to be off.


135
00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:47.126
(Speaks French)

136
00:23:50.254 --> 00:23:51.676
At eight.

137
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:56.018
- Eight o'clock.
- Goodbye, my friend.


138
00:23:58.846 --> 00:24:01.520
(Speaks French)

139
00:24:50.981 --> 00:24:52.654
(Speaks French)

140
00:24:54.068 --> 00:24:55.490
I would like a wallet.

141
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.323
A wallet? Yes.

142
00:24:59.448 --> 00:25:01.200
Maybe we have something for you.

143
00:25:28.352 --> 00:25:29.979
These are like new.

144
00:25:31.522 --> 00:25:33.741
Customers trade them in for caprice,

145
00:25:33.857 --> 00:25:36.030
just to have the most recent model.

146
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.830
They work as well and cost much less.

147
00:25:39.947 --> 00:25:41.995
- Oh, I see.
- Do you like this one?


148
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:45.377
Huh. It's very beautiful.

149
00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:02.014
Good bye.

150
00:29:24.671 --> 00:29:26.264
(Both speaking French)

151
00:29:26.381 --> 00:29:28.304
(Woman replies in French)

152
00:29:35.515 --> 00:29:39.565
(Both speaking French)

153
00:29:52.366 --> 00:29:55.165
(Continuing in French)

154
00:31:05.772 --> 00:31:07.695
- See you later.
- Yes.


155
00:31:07.816 --> 00:31:09.784
(Speaks French)

156
00:31:22.331 --> 00:31:23.958
Earned myself some money.

157
00:31:25.625 --> 00:31:27.673
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

158
00:31:43.435 --> 00:31:46.279
(Train passing)

159
00:31:53.904 --> 00:31:56.999
(Speaking French)

160
00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:06.792
(All speaking French)

161
00:33:06.226 --> 00:33:08.149
(Thunderclap)

162
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:10.272
(Both speaking French)

163
00:33:11.731 --> 00:33:16.032
- Shall we go?
- (Speaks French)


164
00:33:16.153 --> 00:33:18.531
Ah. Goodbye, my friend.

165
00:33:18.655 --> 00:33:19.998
See you later.

166
00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:25.788
Good luck.

167
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.063
(Thunderclap)

168
00:33:50.353 --> 00:33:52.856
- Today is Saturday, right?
- Yes.


169
00:33:53.982 --> 00:33:55.279
Right.

170
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.152
Saturday.

171
00:33:58.278 --> 00:34:01.452
So tomorrow is Sunday.

172
00:34:01.573 --> 00:34:03.575
Now...

173
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.077
200 francs...

174
00:34:08.955 --> 00:34:11.549
...minus 100...

175
00:34:13.126 --> 00:34:14.343
...is...

176
00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:16.922
100 francs.

177
00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:46.038
(Woman speaks French)

178
00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:51.832
Thank you. I'm sorry.

179
00:35:39.296 --> 00:35:40.548
Huh.

180
00:35:57.522 --> 00:35:59.149
(Church bells ring)

181
00:36:00.108 --> 00:36:01.576
Yes!

182
00:36:15.665 --> 00:36:17.087
Thérése...

183
00:36:32.974 --> 00:36:34.726
(Speaks French)

184
00:36:40.315 --> 00:36:42.158
(Speaks French)

185
00:36:49.324 --> 00:36:50.792
(Speaks French)

186
00:37:04.547 --> 00:37:06.094
(Speaks French)

187
00:37:08.843 --> 00:37:10.186
(Speaks French)

188
00:37:18.144 --> 00:37:20.363
(All speaking French)

189
00:37:25.193 --> 00:37:26.991
Ah.

190
00:37:27.112 --> 00:37:28.955
12 o'clock.

191
00:38:38.308 --> 00:38:40.185
(Speaks French)

192
00:38:41.102 --> 00:38:42.775
I'm gonna spend some time here.

193
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.469
(Speaks French)

194
00:39:06.586 --> 00:39:08.759
I'm waiting for Mass to start.

195
00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.903
(Church bells ring)

196
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.962
(Speaks French)

197
00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:29.961
Huh?

198
00:40:30.086 --> 00:40:33.056
(Continues in French)

199
00:40:36.968 --> 00:40:38.811
Oh.

200
00:40:38.928 --> 00:40:40.521
It's true.

201
00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:45.651
I had an appointment.

202
00:40:47.145 --> 00:40:49.147
It's very important.

203
00:40:56.696 --> 00:40:58.289
(Woman) Andreas!

204
00:41:05.121 --> 00:41:06.589
'Andreas.'

205
00:41:58.549 --> 00:41:59.766
Andreas.

206
00:42:07.141 --> 00:42:08.939
Are you alone?

207
00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:12.776
Yes.

208
00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:18.783
Come with me.
Or were you going somewhere?


209
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.287
I had an appointment.

210
00:42:28.538 --> 00:42:29.755
With a woman?

211
00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.293
Thérése.

212
00:42:35.545 --> 00:42:37.172
Is she more important than me?

213
00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:46.773
Come with me.
We have to talk.


214
00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:02.491
<i>Merci.</i>

215
00:45:03.484 --> 00:45:05.111
Do you like this place?

216
00:45:06.821 --> 00:45:08.243
It's special for me.

217
00:45:31.512 --> 00:45:33.139
Can I order for you too?

218
00:45:34.307 --> 00:45:36.025
If you still trust me.

219
00:45:55.912 --> 00:45:57.380
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>

220
00:46:13.888 --> 00:46:15.481
I'm dying to know everything.

221
00:46:16.724 --> 00:46:18.818
Where you've been,
what you've been doing.


222
00:46:24.774 --> 00:46:26.447
(Clears throat)

223
00:46:26.567 --> 00:46:28.114
What do you do now?

224
00:46:29.904 --> 00:46:32.748
- I've started working again.
- Oh.


225
00:46:37.411 --> 00:46:38.663
Two days.

226
00:46:40.122 --> 00:46:42.375
I drink.
I sleep under the bridge.


227
00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.594
(Andreas sighs)

228
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:52.932
What about you?
You must have had a pretty good time.


229
00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:35.644
What about Thérése?

230
00:47:37.555 --> 00:47:40.729
If I didn't come just the right time
you'd be with her now.


231
00:47:42.184 --> 00:47:43.686
(Andreas laughs)

232
00:47:49.567 --> 00:47:50.568
Yes.

233
00:47:57.116 --> 00:47:58.413
Yes.

234
00:50:21.719 --> 00:50:23.721
(Andreas, speaking French)

235
00:50:30.102 --> 00:50:32.446
No, it was my invitation.

236
00:50:32.563 --> 00:50:34.486
(Speaks French)

237
00:51:03.219 --> 00:51:04.846
Then you're rich?

238
00:51:06.388 --> 00:51:08.766
(Andreas sighs)

239
00:51:08.891 --> 00:51:10.188
Yes.

240
00:51:11.894 --> 00:51:16.320
In the last few clays
I'm really starting to believe in miracles.


241
00:51:22.112 --> 00:51:24.114
Do you believe in miracles?

242
00:51:34.833 --> 00:51:39.430
(I Lively tune plays)

243
00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:53.436
I wasn't born for this.

244
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.649
Haven't you tried since then?

245
00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.934
Oh, I always love to dance.

246
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.773
(Door opens)

247
00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:26.073
Come in.

248
00:55:58.222 --> 00:56:00.441
(Train passing)

249
00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:24.102
(Woman) Monsieur?

250
00:59:25.887 --> 00:59:27.389
Monsieur?

251
00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:29.687
(Speaks French)

252
00:59:33.103 --> 00:59:34.776
(Ship's horn)

253
01:00:25.072 --> 01:00:26.824
(Water lapping)

254
01:01:16.915 --> 01:01:19.418
Why didn't you come
to see me last Sunday?


255
01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:31.681
That's not a way to talk to me.

256
01:01:33.849 --> 01:01:35.977
Don't you remember?
I'm your father.


257
01:01:36.977 --> 01:01:39.981
Forgive me, Father,
but do me a favor.


258
01:01:40.105 --> 01:01:42.028
On Sunday morning,

259
01:01:42.149 --> 01:01:45.949
come to me in the church
of Sainte-Marie des Batignolles.


260
01:01:47.696 --> 01:01:48.868
Thérése?

261
01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:58.920
Forgive me.

262
01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:04.671
I thought I was dreaming.

263
01:02:04.796 --> 01:02:07.549
I thought I had
a little girl like you.

264
01:02:20.729 --> 01:02:22.447
(Squawking)

265
01:05:30.919 --> 01:05:34.173
I, er, need some change.
It's possible?


266
01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:36.516
(Speaks French)

267
01:05:54.025 --> 01:05:56.323
Who's that guy?

268
01:05:56.444 --> 01:05:58.492
(Continues in French)

269
01:06:04.369 --> 01:06:05.586
Kanjak.

270
01:06:06.788 --> 01:06:08.256
Daniel Kanjak.

271
01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:13.136
He's from Silesia.
He's my friend.


272
01:06:14.754 --> 01:06:16.427
Ha!

273
01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:21.307
In the picture
he looks like another person.


274
01:06:21.428 --> 01:06:24.398
We went to the same school together
when we were kids.


275
01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:27.142
- I'm serious.
- (Speaks French)


276
01:06:29.894 --> 01:06:32.522
You wouldn't know
where I can find him, would you?


277
01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:34.862
I mean, just to say hello.

278
01:06:34.983 --> 01:06:37.953
(Speaks French)

279
01:06:40.155 --> 01:06:42.032
- How do I get there?
- Taxi.


280
01:07:44.302 --> 01:07:45.929
(indistinct dialogue in French)

281
01:07:59.317 --> 01:08:01.411
Er, I'm a friend of Kanjak's.

282
01:08:01.528 --> 01:08:04.623
We went to school together
in Ostrowiec.


283
01:08:04.739 --> 01:08:06.707
- Ostrowiec?
- Yeah.


284
01:08:06.824 --> 01:08:08.076
Oh.

285
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:24.889
No, no, no.
I'll take care of it.


286
01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:33.313
Good bye.

287
01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:41.158
(indistinct dialogue in French)

288
01:09:14.726 --> 01:09:15.727
Andreas.

289
01:09:16.644 --> 01:09:18.112
Daniel.

290
01:09:22.942 --> 01:09:24.865
Andreas, my friend.

291
01:09:29.324 --> 01:09:31.201
My best friend.

292
01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:02.027
I would like you
to take a suit of mine.


293
01:10:04.942 --> 01:10:07.616
The last couple of days
have been so wonderful.


294
01:10:08.946 --> 01:10:11.870
But, you know, I've got

295
01:10:11.991 --> 01:10:15.791
You know what? I bet
I've got 1,000 suits in my closet.


296
01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:18.040
It would be a pleasure
to see you in one.


297
01:10:18.164 --> 01:10:19.882
Remember when we were in school?

298
01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:23.386
You always let me copy.

299
01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:30.101
Well? What do you say?

300
01:10:30.218 --> 01:10:33.438
Where do you live?
I'll send it over.


301
01:10:33.554 --> 01:10:36.774
Er... you can't send it.

302
01:10:38.393 --> 01:10:40.862
- Why not?
- I don't have an address.


303
01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:47.861
I sleep under newspapers.

304
01:10:47.985 --> 01:10:49.578
I'll get you a hotel room.

305
01:11:02.542 --> 01:11:04.544
(Speaks French)

306
01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.984
(Continues in French)

307
01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:31.534
If you have need of anything,
just ring the bell and order.


308
01:11:35.241 --> 01:11:40.748
But now I want to take you out
for a drink to celebrate this room.


309
01:11:40.872 --> 01:11:42.749
I'll take you to a very special place.

310
01:11:43.791 --> 01:11:45.293
(I Musical accompaniment)

311
01:12:37.094 --> 01:12:39.688
The girls are coming down now.
You like dancing?


312
01:12:39.806 --> 01:12:42.355
Yes, but for me it's already late.

313
01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:18.094
(Andreas) Thanks a bunch.

314
01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:20.730
Good night.

315
01:13:25.852 --> 01:13:26.978
Andreas?

316
01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:30.198
Tomorrow I'm sending you two suits.

317
01:13:30.314 --> 01:13:32.737
- Why?
" Why not?


318
01:13:32.859 --> 01:13:36.864
- Because one is more than enough.
- You need some money?


319
01:13:36.988 --> 01:13:40.788
- (Clock chimes)
- I still have 900 francs in my pocket.


320
01:13:42.118 --> 01:13:43.119
<i>Ciao.</i>

321
01:13:45.496 --> 01:13:46.964
See you.

322
01:15:40.945 --> 01:15:43.198
(Footsteps)

323
01:16:16.522 --> 01:16:19.571
(Lift clanging)

324
01:16:42.506 --> 01:16:43.507
(Clears throat)

325
01:16:49.221 --> 01:16:50.848
You are very beautiful.

326
01:16:51.515 --> 01:16:53.643
(Lift clanging)

327
01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.365
So are you.

328
01:17:04.695 --> 01:17:06.572
Can I see you again?

329
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:12.287
Tomorrow maybe.

330
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:14.413
Right, tomorrow.

331
01:17:30.763 --> 01:17:32.310
(Exhales)

332
01:17:32.431 --> 01:17:33.648
Oh!

334
01:18:33.325 --> 01:18:36.044
(Footsteps continue)

335
01:19:59.787 --> 01:20:01.664
Do you want to ask me something?

336
01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:05.459
Yes.

337
01:20:08.254 --> 01:20:10.382
I can't wait until tomorrow.

338
01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:56.556
You like books, huh?

339
01:20:58.637 --> 01:21:00.605
If I've nothing better to do.

340
01:21:06.103 --> 01:21:08.026
I never read.

341
01:21:08.147 --> 01:21:09.649
I don't have books.

342
01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.703
I have lots of time.

343
01:21:16.864 --> 01:21:19.413
I'm only here for a few days.

344
01:21:19.533 --> 01:21:22.537
Till Sunday at the most.

345
01:21:22.661 --> 01:21:26.086
On Monday I have to be on stage.

346
01:21:26.206 --> 01:21:27.628
In Cannes.

347
01:21:30.336 --> 01:21:33.510
- You're an artist.
- A dancer.


348
01:21:33.630 --> 01:21:35.849
At the casino.

349
01:21:35.966 --> 01:21:37.764
Haven't you ever heard my name?

350
01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:41.062
Gaby.

351
01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.306
Gaby?

352
01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:45.476
Ah, yes.

353
01:21:46.518 --> 01:21:48.111
You know my name?

354
01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.278
Of course.

355
01:21:51.398 --> 01:21:53.366
From the newspapers.

356
01:22:01.367 --> 01:22:03.085
And now?

357
01:24:32.309 --> 01:24:35.358
Where are you taking me
so beautifully dressed?


358
01:24:37.022 --> 01:24:41.152
I have a whole day to spend with you
before I go back to Cannes.


359
01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:44.029
Er... I'll take you to...

360
01:24:44.154 --> 01:24:45.747
Fontainebleau.

361
01:24:47.699 --> 01:24:51.420
Yes, and a whole night.

362
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:59.962
(Thunderclap)

363
01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:11.273

(All speaking French)

365
01:26:18.415 --> 01:26:20.133
Been here before?

366
01:26:21.668 --> 01:26:23.341
What do you want?

367
01:26:27.758 --> 01:26:29.510
I already know what you want.

368
01:26:32.888 --> 01:26:35.107
<i>- You do'?
- Mm-hm.</i>


369
01:27:11.468 --> 01:27:13.641
(Bells chime)

370
01:27:19.309 --> 01:27:22.438
- What are you doing?
- I have a debt to pay.


371
01:27:23.855 --> 01:27:25.983
- On Sunday?
- Yes.


372
01:27:39.496 --> 01:27:43.091
I'm a little late already
so I have to leave.


373
01:27:43.208 --> 01:27:46.633
And whom do you owe the money to?
A man or a woman?


374
01:27:46.753 --> 01:27:48.346
A girl named Thérése.

375
01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:49.715
Get out, you bastard. Out!

376
01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.966
- Hey...
- Get out!


377
01:27:51.091 --> 01:27:52.889
Hey, don't.

378
01:30:32.168 --> 01:30:33.670
Andreas!

379
01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:35.297
Woitech.

380
01:30:35.422 --> 01:30:36.890
Andreas.

381
01:30:37.507 --> 01:30:39.430
Ah!

382
01:30:39.551 --> 01:30:42.225
(Laughing)

383
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:47.063
Yes, Woitech.

384
01:30:48.351 --> 01:30:49.648
Can you wait for me?

385
01:30:49.769 --> 01:30:52.192
Can you wait for me here
until Mass is over?


386
01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:53.987
What? Mass?

387
01:30:54.858 --> 01:30:57.577
You haven't got buddy-buddy
with the priest, have you?


388
01:30:57.694 --> 01:31:00.698
No, I have to go see little Thérése.

389
01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:03.075
- What for?
- I owe her some money.


390
01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:05.418
It's a debt I have to pay
to the little saint.


391
01:31:06.745 --> 01:31:09.919
- How much do you owe her?
- 200 francs.


392
01:31:12.584 --> 01:31:14.257
- Then I'll come with you.
- Oh?


393
01:31:14.377 --> 01:31:17.256
- Yeah?
- Oh, yes. Yes.


394
01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:19.758
(I Singing in Latin)

395
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:46.664
Woitech, what are you doing?
What's the matter?


396
01:31:50.288 --> 01:31:51.835
I'm in trouble.

397
01:31:52.916 --> 01:31:55.089
There's a guy waiting for me outside.

398
01:31:56.127 --> 01:31:58.550
I have to give him back 200 francs.

399
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:02.513
If I don't, he might
have me thrown in jail.


400
01:32:03.927 --> 01:32:05.725
You should have told me.

401
01:32:08.348 --> 01:32:10.021
I didn't have the guts.

402
01:32:13.395 --> 01:32:15.068
I understand.

403
01:32:19.693 --> 01:32:21.695
I've been in your shoes.

404
01:32:25.991 --> 01:32:27.334
Hey, come on.

405
01:32:30.829 --> 01:32:32.001
Take it.

406
01:32:33.623 --> 01:32:35.500
I don't need it.

407
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:49.268
- See you at the bar.
- Shh.


408
01:34:53.805 --> 01:34:56.479
Oh, Andreas! (Chuckling)

409
01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.102
Come in, come in!

410
01:34:59.227 --> 01:35:01.070
Have a seat.

411
01:35:04.274 --> 01:35:06.527
You're a real friend.

412
01:35:07.819 --> 01:35:11.323
We wouldn't be friends after everything
we went through together?


413
01:35:12.157 --> 01:35:13.534
Friends,

414
01:35:13.658 --> 01:35:16.707
for everything and in everything.

415
01:35:28.006 --> 01:35:31.556

(Andreas) # Paris, c'est une blonde... #

417
01:36:13.468 --> 01:36:17.098
I used to know this dancer
from the casino.


418
01:36:17.222 --> 01:36:19.475
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


419
01:36:28.566 --> 01:36:31.319
I was in love for two days.

420
01:36:32.403 --> 01:36:34.451
I could fall in love for ten minutes.

421
01:36:34.572 --> 01:36:36.791
(I Music stops)

422
01:36:36.908 --> 01:36:38.751
(Applause)

423
01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:55.142
Do you remember what day it is?

424
01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:57.888
Er, I know how to find out.

425
01:36:58.012 --> 01:37:00.140
I lost my count.

426
01:37:00.265 --> 01:37:02.893
See you Sunday,
same time, same place. Ciao.


427
01:37:04.435 --> 01:37:06.028
Yeah, see you.

428
01:38:30.188 --> 01:38:32.441
Do you need some money?

429
01:38:40.448 --> 01:38:43.372
I know, I'm still in debt to you.

430
01:38:45.036 --> 01:38:47.004
Hm? To me?

431
01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:51.004
I was supposed to deliver
the money to little Thérése.


432
01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:53.924
I can assure you,
I went there every Sunday.


433
01:38:54.045 --> 01:38:56.719
But every time I went,
something went wrong


434
01:38:56.839 --> 01:38:58.386
so I couldn't do it.

435
01:38:58.508 --> 01:39:01.887
Evidently you're mistaking me
for someone else.


436
01:39:02.804 --> 01:39:08.311
But I can't help seeing
that you are in some difficulty.


437
01:39:10.353 --> 01:39:15.735
And, as for little Therese
of whom you were just speaking,


438
01:39:16.859 --> 01:39:20.739
I have such an obligation to her

439
01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:26.374
that I would gladly advance you
any money that you need.


440
01:39:26.494 --> 01:39:28.917
How much is it?

441
01:39:29.038 --> 01:39:30.665
200 francs.

442
01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:34.586
Excuse me.

443
01:39:43.302 --> 01:39:44.349
There.

444
01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:51.444
I must assure you,
I am still an honorable man.


445
01:39:52.562 --> 01:39:55.281
Unfortunately
I don't have an address yet.


446
01:39:55.398 --> 01:39:58.322
Just like me, huh?
No, really, don't worry.


447
01:39:58.443 --> 01:40:02.789
Because the kindness that you do me
in accepting this little money


448
01:40:02.905 --> 01:40:05.875
is something that I could never repay.

449
01:40:07.827 --> 01:40:12.754
Because I too,
I owe a great deal to little Therese.


450
01:40:15.293 --> 01:40:16.294
So...

451
01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:19.301
Thank you. yes?

452
01:40:20.256 --> 01:40:21.633

It's me.

In the same mine.

465
01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:58.713
In the same tunnel.

466
01:57:00.881 --> 01:57:02.804
Have a seat, my friend.

467
01:57:04.593 --> 01:57:05.890
Here.

468
01:57:06.011 --> 01:57:07.809
Have the place of honor.

469
01:57:08.972 --> 01:57:10.224
(Andreas) I'm fine.

470
01:57:11.266 --> 01:57:15.021
Friends always sit
at the place of honor.


471

You're my friend, too.

472

Friends for everything

473
01:57:21.902 --> 01:57:24.075

Listen.

476
01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:37.213
Just now something...

477
01:57:39.503 --> 01:57:43.258
When I was crossing the square
something extraordinary happened.


478
01:57:46.301 --> 01:57:48.224
A policeman stops me.

479
01:57:50.931 --> 01:57:54.811
I think that he's gonna ask me
for my papers.


480
01:57:56.937 --> 01:57:58.814
I'm in a terrible mess.

481
01:58:00.190 --> 01:58:01.737
Instead...

482
01:58:03.068 --> 01:58:05.617
he says I've lost my wallet

483
01:58:05.737 --> 01:58:08.286
and he gives me a wallet
that isn't mine.


484
01:58:11.743 --> 01:58:13.416
It's a sign of God.

485
01:58:16.414 --> 01:58:18.212
I had to accept it.

486
01:58:20.877 --> 01:58:21.878
Look.

487
01:58:42.983 --> 01:58:44.155
Now...

488
01:58:46.403 --> 01:58:49.373
I am going to pay my debt.

489
01:58:49.489 --> 01:58:52.584
Don't go now.
The priests are still saying Mass.


490
01:58:52.701 --> 01:58:55.170
What's <i>Mass</i> to you?

491
01:58:55.287 --> 01:58:59.087
As soon as it's over
you can go to the sacristy.


492
01:59:33.825 --> 01:59:36.044
(Andreas) What are you doing here?

493
01:59:39.789 --> 01:59:42.633
I'm waiting for my parents.

494
01:59:42.751 --> 01:59:47.848
In a little while they will get out of Mass
and come and get me.


495
01:59:47.964 --> 01:59:50.217
We always do it this way.

496
01:59:50.342 --> 01:59:52.765
Every fourth Sunday.

497
01:59:55.889 --> 01:59:58.563
Will you tell me your name?

01:59:58.683 --> 01:59:59.775
Thérése.

499
02:00:09.736 --> 02:00:11.238
Thérése.

500
02:00:18.203 --> 02:00:19.921
That's perfect.

501
02:00:21.956 --> 02:00:25.836
I... I never thought
that a saint,


502
02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:29.173
so great yet so little,

503
02:00:30.090 --> 02:00:33.435
a creditor so little yet so great,

504
02:00:34.219 --> 02:00:36.938
could do me the honor

505
02:00:37.055 --> 02:00:41.606
to come to me
after I failed for such a long time


506
02:00:42.852 --> 02:00:44.479
to come to her.

507
02:00:49.984 --> 02:00:51.281
I know

508
02:00:51.403 --> 02:00:56.455
it's your delicacy and your preciousness.

509
02:00:59.244 --> 02:01:01.042
I failed.

510
02:01:03.915 --> 02:01:09.137
I owed you 200 francs
and I couldn't pay them back


511
02:01:09.254 --> 02:01:10.380
for so long.

512
02:01:12.966 --> 02:01:14.388
Ah.

513
02:01:15.385 --> 02:01:17.808
<i>Mademoiselle saint.</i>

514
02:01:21.599 --> 02:01:23.647
But you owe me nothing.

515
02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:31.401
Yes.

516
02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:33.319
I...

517
02:01:34.821 --> 02:01:37.700
I tried so many times.

518
02:01:44.622 --> 02:01:49.048
If you need it
I have a little money in my bag.


519
02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:52.012
Take it.

520
02:02:09.397 --> 02:02:11.650
Now I have to go

521
02:02:11.775 --> 02:02:14.870
because Mass is almost over

522
02:02:14.986 --> 02:02:17.580
and my parents will be coming.

523
02:02:22.786 --> 02:02:25.414
(Church bells ring)

524
02:02:31.628 --> 02:02:32.629
Woitech.

525
02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:36.967
Woitech.

526
02:02:38.259 --> 02:02:40.011
Help me.

527
02:02:40.136 --> 02:02:41.729
My friend.

528
02:02:43.056 --> 02:02:44.683
You need a drink.

529
02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:55.068
(All speaking French)

530
02:04:25.783 --> 02:04:28.783
"May God grant all of us drinkers
such a good and easy death."
