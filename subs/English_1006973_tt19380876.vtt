1
00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:18.408
Ghost.

2
00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.079
You know, the iconic scene with
demi moore and patrick swayze


3
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.430
Where he's a ghost and
they're making pottery.


4
00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.303
I remember patrick
swayze and keanu reeves


5
00:01:29.327 --> 00:01:31.167
In that surfing heist movie.

6
00:01:31.496 --> 00:01:33.571
okay. It's
called<i>point break.</i>


7
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.590
And I'm going to
give you a break


8
00:01:35.742 --> 00:01:37.629
Since you were probably studying

9
00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:39.986
Or at home watching a
doc series with george.


10
00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.279
- What, you don't like him?
- Oh, I love george.


11
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:44.135
I mean, who wouldn't
love a kitten?


12
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.987
Now, stella. God
bless her soul.


13
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:47.580
I couldn't stand that old cat.

14
00:01:47.604 --> 00:01:49.398
Listen, I like my routine,

15
00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:51.440
As mundane as it might be.

16
00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:53.920
Also, I was probably four years
old when that movie came out.


17
00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:55.744
- Just saying.
- True.


18
00:01:56.613 --> 00:01:58.071
"the provocateur."

19
00:01:59.174 --> 00:02:00.449
James sosa.

20
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.433
Hmm. Abstract.

21
00:02:02.453 --> 00:02:04.489
I personally prefer
the charcoal sketches.


22
00:02:04.513 --> 00:02:05.862
Mm.

23
00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:07.934
Interesting what we're drawn to.

24
00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:10.662
Oh. Are you
an art collector?


25
00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:14.020
No, but I do like art.

26
00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:15.925
So what brought
you here tonight?


27
00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.208
I am her date.
Also, her attorney.


28
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.543
And dr. Williams
was gifted tickets


29
00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:22.787
From one of her
patients for saving


30
00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:24.030
- Their daughter's life.
- Wow.


31
00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.198
I reset their daughter's arm

32
00:02:25.217 --> 00:02:26.417
After she fell from a swing.

33
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.761
As for the art, I like it.

34
00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:31.871
This piece, at least.

35
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.035
- But not the others?
- The charcoal sketches?


36
00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:35.984
They're, uh... I don't know,

37
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.469
- A little too risqué for me.
- Too risqué?


38
00:02:38.563 --> 00:02:40.989
- Sexually, I think she means.
- Nina.


39
00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:43.140
It's okay, it's okay.
To each their own.


40
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.236
I only meant she's more
conservative than me.


41
00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:48.308
I love them.

42
00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:50.074
This one, though.

43
00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:51.984
It's colorful.

44
00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:54.669
Makes me happy.

45
00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:56.563
You should make a bid.

46
00:02:56.656 --> 00:02:58.616
It's a little past
my price point.


47
00:02:58.658 --> 00:03:00.618
Every artist has
to make a living.


48
00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:02.380
And a great living at that.

49
00:03:02.404 --> 00:03:04.846
Well, um, keep my
fingers crossed


50
00:03:05.073 --> 00:03:07.051
That you beautiful ladies
will treat yourself


51
00:03:07.075 --> 00:03:09.342
To an artistic happiness
and buy the painting.


52
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.951
I have a hunch it will
look terrific in your home.


53
00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:16.561
Ladies, have a good evening.

54
00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:18.418
Oh. Smokin'.

55
00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:20.529
Mm, is he ever.

56
00:03:21.606 --> 00:03:23.198
Good evening, everyone.

57
00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:26.017
And welcome to tonight's
art exhibition.


58
00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:28.762
We are extremely
grateful and honored


59
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.522
That james sosa
accepted our request


60
00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:33.875
To show his latest
collection here,


61
00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:36.545
At his home away from home city,

62
00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:38.362
That being Italy...

63
00:03:38.456 --> 00:03:40.623
Probably should
have asked his name.


64
00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:42.292
Probably should have.

65
00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:44.961
Mr. Sosa's art
gives us insight


66
00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:46.888
Into human relations.

67
00:03:47.874 --> 00:03:51.301
So without further ado,
let us begin the bidding.


68
00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:52.644
"the provocateur."

69
00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.140
Do I hear 25,000?

70
00:04:00.404 --> 00:04:03.697
Georgie, are you hungry?

71
00:04:30.826 --> 00:04:32.492
<i>Here in
florida, we live with alligators</i>


72
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.510
<i>Such as this one</i>

73
00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:36.886
<i>Trying to weather the
winter in the gator hole.</i>


74
00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:40.442
<i>Over a million of them thrive
in our lakes and rivers.</i>


75
00:04:41.778 --> 00:04:45.355
<i>Every few years, a person
is killed by an alligator,</i>


76
00:04:45.507 --> 00:04:48.174
<i>Reminding us to treat them
with caution and respect.</i>


77
00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:13.511
You're hungry again, george?

78
00:05:36.892 --> 00:05:38.408
Good morning, everyone.

79
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.720
I'm sorry to call you
in before your shift.


80
00:05:41.487 --> 00:05:43.483
She's been here before.
It looks complicated.


81
00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:44.725
- Room seven?
- Yeah.


82
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:46.916
- Okay.
- Here you go.


83
00:05:47.068 --> 00:05:48.828
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


84
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.854
- Hi, maggie.
- Hi, dr. Williams.


85
00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:01.940
he did it again?

86
00:06:03.935 --> 00:06:05.860
Did you call new beginnings,

87
00:06:06.087 --> 00:06:08.487
The organization that we put
you in touch with last time?


88
00:06:09.274 --> 00:06:10.834
- Mm-hmm.
- And?


89
00:06:11.517 --> 00:06:12.517
I'm going.

90
00:06:14.037 --> 00:06:15.837
To new beginnings, I mean.

91
00:06:16.355 --> 00:06:18.598
and I left
a voice message


92
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:20.891
For that lawyer that you
put me in touch with.


93
00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:24.106
And then I told arnie, and
that's what triggered him.


94
00:06:25.273 --> 00:06:26.918
And I know that
nobody understands,


95
00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:28.602
But I just couldn't
go, you know,


96
00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:30.271
Without telling him goodbye.

97
00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.345
It's like...

98
00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:37.784
Underneath all of that anger,

99
00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:42.305
He could be... you
know, he could be good


100
00:06:42.457 --> 00:06:44.290
When he's not drinking.

101
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:45.808
He really can be.

102
00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:46.961
I know.

103
00:06:48.238 --> 00:06:50.107
Everything is going
to be okay. I promise.


104
00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:52.171
- Okay.
- Let's get you cleaned up.


105
00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:57.820
So tell me, how's your
daughter doing away at college?


106
00:06:57.914 --> 00:07:00.473
You must be so proud of her
for getting that scholarship.


107
00:07:00.492 --> 00:07:01.991
Oh, I am.

108
00:07:02.143 --> 00:07:03.585
I really, really am.

109
00:07:07.907 --> 00:07:10.107
- Five to one, did you see it?
- I fell asleep.


110
00:07:10.318 --> 00:07:12.238
Did you place our
lunch order, yet?


111
00:07:12.262 --> 00:07:13.906
- I've got you covered...
- Come on, ya mall cop!


112
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.246
Just tell me where she is.

113
00:07:15.265 --> 00:07:16.747
She's my wife and law's the law

114
00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:18.152
And you gotta take me to her.

115
00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:20.016
- Oh, great.
- Hey. Hey, you.


116
00:07:21.254 --> 00:07:22.823
What can I help you
with, mr. Mcdougal?


117
00:07:22.847 --> 00:07:24.492
My wife. Where she at?

118
00:07:24.516 --> 00:07:26.332
- Not here.
- But was she here?


119
00:07:26.351 --> 00:07:28.070
I don't feel comfortable
answering that.


120
00:07:28.094 --> 00:07:29.426
She was either
here or she wasn't.


121
00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:31.337
So what is it?

122
00:07:31.356 --> 00:07:32.817
I'm not comfortable
with your tone of voice


123
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:34.265
Or the aggression
that I'm sensing.


124
00:07:34.284 --> 00:07:35.933
And further, it's
my understanding


125
00:07:35.952 --> 00:07:37.655
That there is a
restraining order in place


126
00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:39.414
For maggie mcdougal.
And in lieu of that,


127
00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:41.697
Unless you're here
to admit yourself


128
00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:43.032
For a medical emergency,

129
00:07:43.126 --> 00:07:44.345
I'm going to have to ask you

130
00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:46.249
To leave the hospital premises.

131
00:07:46.704 --> 00:07:48.332
You think you're better
than me, don't you?


132
00:07:48.356 --> 00:07:50.184
You think you can
just come on in


133
00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:53.026
And tell my wife she
can just leave me?


134
00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:54.672
I know what you said to her.

135
00:07:54.696 --> 00:07:56.287
She told me. She
told me it all.


136
00:07:56.306 --> 00:07:57.766
Well, I got news for you, doc.

137
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.118
You messed with the wrong man.

138
00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:00.700
The wrong man, you hear me?

139
00:08:00.718 --> 00:08:02.363
Get your hands off of me!

140
00:08:10.712 --> 00:08:12.803
You'd think with all this
technology we'd be done


141
00:08:12.823 --> 00:08:14.449
With old school patient folders.

142
00:08:14.473 --> 00:08:16.883
but technology isn't foolproof.

143
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:19.021
System can always get
hacked and go down.


144
00:08:19.054 --> 00:08:21.329
Cabinet? Fireproof.

145
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.050
That it is.

146
00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:24.557
I gotta give it to you.

147
00:08:24.576 --> 00:08:25.794
I'm impressed with
all this running


148
00:08:25.818 --> 00:08:27.054
You've been doing every day.

149
00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:28.539
Don't have time for the gym,

150
00:08:28.563 --> 00:08:30.132
So only way to stay fit

151
00:08:30.156 --> 00:08:31.822
Is to get it in
to and from home.


152
00:08:31.842 --> 00:08:33.399
Like I said, I'm impressed.

153
00:08:33.418 --> 00:08:34.538
See you tomorrow, boss.

154
00:08:34.736 --> 00:08:36.235
See ya then.

155
00:10:09.588 --> 00:10:10.897
Dr. Williams?

156
00:10:13.426 --> 00:10:15.777
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?


157
00:10:15.928 --> 00:10:17.070
Actually, no. I...

158
00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:21.765
I think someone was
trying to rob me.


159
00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:24.677
I... I left work
to jog home, and...


160
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.288
And then this man
started following me.


161
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.292
I hopped a fence and I ran down
some alleys and I ended up here.


162
00:10:31.444 --> 00:10:32.627
You hop a fence?

163
00:10:33.538 --> 00:10:34.963
It was a first.

164
00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:40.284
- I... I think I lost him.
- Are you sure?


165
00:10:40.378 --> 00:10:42.286
Hey, why don't you come
inside and catch your breath?


166
00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:44.008
No, I don't... I don't
want to bother you.


167
00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:45.600
You're not bothering
me. I live right here.


168
00:10:45.624 --> 00:10:47.361
Let me get you a glass of water.

169
00:10:47.385 --> 00:10:48.985
- Um...
- This way.


170
00:11:03.885 --> 00:11:05.885
Impressive.

171
00:11:05.978 --> 00:11:08.178
Aside from the charcoal
collection, I take it.


172
00:11:09.648 --> 00:11:11.385
I'm really sorry
about the comment


173
00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:13.295
I made the other
night at your opening.


174
00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:15.670
I didn't know you
were the artist.


175
00:11:15.897 --> 00:11:19.340
It's okay. Would that
have changed your opinion?


176
00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:20.567
Maybe.

177
00:11:23.013 --> 00:11:25.513
So alive and vibrant.

178
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.159
Is that how they make you feel?

179
00:11:27.183 --> 00:11:28.599
I suppose.

180
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.835
I definitely see your style.

181
00:11:31.855 --> 00:11:33.763
Hmm. Colorful.

182
00:11:33.857 --> 00:11:34.857
So I've been told.

183
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:38.469
Have you ever
dabbled in the arts?


184
00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:40.253
I mean, have you
ever tried painting?


185
00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:42.922
These days, it's just
paint by numbers.


186
00:11:43.015 --> 00:11:44.677
Would you like to try?

187
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:47.017
- You mean right now?
- Mm-hmm.


188
00:11:47.037 --> 00:11:48.594
I don't want to
waste your canvas.


189
00:11:48.613 --> 00:11:50.279
It's up to you.

190
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:52.351
But I think it can
only help you unwind


191
00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:53.690
From what I think,

192
00:11:53.785 --> 00:11:55.625
It was not a fun experience.

193
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:58.411
All right. Why not?

194
00:12:02.777 --> 00:12:03.959
Any tips?

195
00:12:04.112 --> 00:12:06.612
Um, just dip the brush

196
00:12:06.631 --> 00:12:08.222
Into the paint,

197
00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:11.117
And express whatever
you have inside.


198
00:12:23.073 --> 00:12:24.964
- What?
- Nothing.


199
00:12:24.982 --> 00:12:27.650
It just looks like
you're enjoying this.


200
00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:35.399
You're stressed. You're
holding in your wrist.


201
00:12:35.418 --> 00:12:37.159
Just... just relax.

202
00:12:37.312 --> 00:12:38.494
Whatever you feel inside,

203
00:12:38.646 --> 00:12:40.421
Let it come to life.

204
00:13:35.052 --> 00:13:37.219
Thanks for the ride.
And the art lesson.


205
00:13:37.313 --> 00:13:38.795
Well, you're welcome.

206
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.798
And, uh, listen, this
is my phone number.


207
00:13:41.818 --> 00:13:44.134
Feel free to text me anytime
you want another one.


208
00:13:44.228 --> 00:13:45.965
- Art lesson?
- Or a chat.


209
00:13:45.989 --> 00:13:47.396
I'll take either.

210
00:13:47.548 --> 00:13:49.574
- Thanks again.
- Ciao.


211
00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:16.242
<i>Turned around</i>

212
00:14:16.335 --> 00:14:18.389
<i>And there it was
drifting toward her,</i>


213
00:14:18.413 --> 00:14:21.080
<i>Sort of propelled by
the swirling water.</i>


214
00:14:21.098 --> 00:14:23.316
<i>It looked like a
huge inflatable toy.</i>


215
00:14:24.343 --> 00:14:25.842
<i>But this was no plaything.</i>

216
00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:29.179
<i>When I could see that
the alligator wasn't...</i>


217
00:14:31.092 --> 00:14:33.070
<i>Attack me, I decided
to follow it.</i>


218
00:14:33.094 --> 00:14:35.203
<i>That may not have
been the best idea.</i>


219
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.354
<i>- But it gave me...</i>
- Hi, it's dr. Williams.


220
00:14:37.373 --> 00:14:39.293
Seems I may have lost my phone.

221
00:14:39.358 --> 00:14:41.438
If you need me, please
call my landline.


222
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:43.914
<i>Every few years,</i>

223
00:14:43.938 --> 00:14:45.978
<i>A person is killed
by an alligator,</i>


224
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:47.601
<i>Reminding us to
treat them with...</i>


225
00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:07.960
- Hello?
- Good morning!


226
00:15:07.979 --> 00:15:09.715
Actually, not so good
morning over here.


227
00:15:09.739 --> 00:15:11.366
I lost my phone last night

228
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.368
And have to go and
backtrack my steps.


229
00:15:13.392 --> 00:15:14.887
<i>That would explain
why it's going to voicemail.</i>


230
00:15:14.911 --> 00:15:16.744
<i>Okay, I'll be quick.</i>

231
00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:18.799
I went down to the shelter
to see maggie mcdougal.


232
00:15:18.823 --> 00:15:20.208
I have a statement from her,

233
00:15:20.232 --> 00:15:21.543
And now I just need one from you

234
00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:22.803
To bring before the court.

235
00:15:22.827 --> 00:15:24.585
No problem. Can you send me

236
00:15:24.737 --> 00:15:26.790
The draft you prepared to
review so I can add to it?


237
00:15:26.814 --> 00:15:27.813
<i>Will do.</i>

238
00:15:27.832 --> 00:15:29.665
'kay. Talk to you soon.

239
00:15:29.817 --> 00:15:32.176
- And I hope you find your phone.
- Me too. Bye.


240
00:16:41.313 --> 00:16:42.866
Hey. What are you doing here?

241
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.239
Um, hi!

242
00:16:44.392 --> 00:16:46.294
Seems I lost my
phone last night.


243
00:16:46.318 --> 00:16:48.227
Thought maybe it
was outside here.


244
00:16:48.245 --> 00:16:50.171
It's not in your place, is it?

245
00:16:50.322 --> 00:16:52.565
I don't know. Why don't
you come in and look?


246
00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:54.143
- Ah.
- Come in.


247
00:16:54.177 --> 00:16:55.177
We'll look for it.

248
00:16:55.403 --> 00:16:57.069
Thanks.

249
00:17:02.577 --> 00:17:05.603
I don't think it's here
but, uh, let me see.


250
00:17:08.766 --> 00:17:11.083
Nope. I don't see it anywhere.

251
00:17:11.176 --> 00:17:12.843
I probably lost it
when I was running.


252
00:17:12.862 --> 00:17:14.656
I'll pull up find my
iphone on my computer


253
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.920
When I get to the office,
see if I can track it.


254
00:17:18.092 --> 00:17:20.926
You know, my cousin
rita, she's a detective.


255
00:17:20.945 --> 00:17:23.445
And she deals with this
kind of stuff all the time.


256
00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:26.782
I can drop her a line and maybe
she can help us locate it.


257
00:17:26.934 --> 00:17:28.854
find
my missing phone?


258
00:17:30.104 --> 00:17:32.006
I'm sure she has better
things to be doing.


259
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.839
She probably does. But!

260
00:17:34.717 --> 00:17:36.557
I can always text her and see

261
00:17:36.627 --> 00:17:38.702
If she has any tips
on locating it.


262
00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:40.295
That's really sweet of you.

263
00:17:40.448 --> 00:17:42.372
It's okay. I'm
sure I'll find it.


264
00:17:42.392 --> 00:17:44.018
My shift is about to
start at the hospital


265
00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:45.762
So I should get going.

266
00:17:45.878 --> 00:17:48.545
- I'll give you a lift.
- No, you don't have to.


267
00:17:48.639 --> 00:17:49.880
No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

268
00:17:49.899 --> 00:17:51.790
I have some errands to run

269
00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:53.695
And I'm going towards
your hospital anyhow.


270
00:17:53.719 --> 00:17:57.463
Hmm? Plus, I don't know if
your phone dropped in my car.


271
00:17:57.481 --> 00:17:59.982
We can always look over
there, so give me one second.


272
00:18:00.134 --> 00:18:01.703
I'm just going to put
some underwear on.


273
00:18:01.727 --> 00:18:03.647
- Okay?
- Don't forget your shirt.


274
00:18:03.804 --> 00:18:05.896
Shirt. What?

275
00:18:05.915 --> 00:18:08.565
Shirtless ,
uh, not the thing anymore?


276
00:18:08.584 --> 00:18:09.975
Anymore.

277
00:18:09.994 --> 00:18:11.419
Anymore.

278
00:18:13.089 --> 00:18:14.808
All right, good to go!

279
00:18:14.832 --> 00:18:16.384
Now, remember, the
most important thing


280
00:18:16.408 --> 00:18:18.311
About taking care
of your cast is...


281
00:18:18.335 --> 00:18:19.576
To keep it clean.

282
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.739
Making sure that your friends

283
00:18:20.763 --> 00:18:22.337
Do artwork on it, silly.

284
00:18:22.432 --> 00:18:24.232
- Yes.
- Take care now.


285
00:18:25.268 --> 00:18:27.009
Bye, dr. Williams.

286
00:18:34.518 --> 00:18:35.693
Let's track ya.

287
00:18:51.686 --> 00:18:52.793
<i>Hey, doc.</i>

288
00:18:54.355 --> 00:18:55.946
<i>Ya missing something?</i>

289
00:19:01.362 --> 00:19:02.695
<i>Hey, doc.</i>

290
00:19:02.713 --> 00:19:04.138
<i>Ya missing something?</i>

291
00:19:15.801 --> 00:19:17.688
You said your cousin
was a detective.


292
00:19:28.239 --> 00:19:29.716
Oh, yeah. He's in the system.

293
00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.556
Long rap sheet with
several warrants


294
00:19:30.574 --> 00:19:31.982
After his arrest.

295
00:19:32.076 --> 00:19:33.956
- So what's next?
- We find him.


296
00:19:35.062 --> 00:19:37.654
Do you have another phone
to use in the meantime?


297
00:19:37.673 --> 00:19:39.565
Already done. Along
with the new sim card.


298
00:19:39.583 --> 00:19:41.992
Okay, well, let me
get on this now.


299
00:19:42.011 --> 00:19:44.236
I take it you'll ease
up on the evening runs


300
00:19:44.329 --> 00:19:45.807
Until we have more
information on this?


301
00:19:45.831 --> 00:19:47.573
Of course.

302
00:19:47.666 --> 00:19:49.499
- Do you live alone?
- With my roommate.


303
00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:52.244
- But he's a cat.
- okay.


304
00:19:52.337 --> 00:19:53.740
Well, if you see
anything suspicious,


305
00:19:53.764 --> 00:19:55.856
You call me right away.

306
00:19:56.083 --> 00:19:58.283
Will do and thank you
so much for coming down.


307
00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:00.230
How do you know my
cousin, by the way?


308
00:20:00.254 --> 00:20:01.362
New friend.

309
00:20:02.423 --> 00:20:04.325
Met him at his art
exhibition here in town.


310
00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:07.183
Oh, right. Well,
he's a great guy.


311
00:20:07.203 --> 00:20:09.370
- Said nice things about you.
- He did?


312
00:20:09.597 --> 00:20:10.597
He did.

313
00:20:11.282 --> 00:20:12.684
I'll be in touch soon.

314
00:20:19.123 --> 00:20:21.549
So it seems arnie mcdougal
followed me home last night


315
00:20:21.776 --> 00:20:22.816
And stole my phone.

316
00:20:22.868 --> 00:20:24.610
Seriously?

317
00:20:24.628 --> 00:20:26.423
The police are on it
and I told security.


318
00:20:26.447 --> 00:20:28.182
Makes me really uneasy
that he followed you.


319
00:20:28.206 --> 00:20:31.041
Yeah. Tell me
about it. Anyhow.


320
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.372
I'm going to go call a
rideshare and get out of here.


321
00:20:33.396 --> 00:20:35.045
I'm right behind you.

322
00:20:35.064 --> 00:20:37.224
- See you tomorrow.
- Stay safe, dr. Williams.


323
00:20:42.071 --> 00:20:43.219
Hello there!

324
00:20:43.314 --> 00:20:45.573
Well, hello again to you, too!

325
00:20:45.724 --> 00:20:47.633
I was just in the neighborhood

326
00:20:47.726 --> 00:20:49.392
And I thought maybe you
need a ride back home


327
00:20:49.412 --> 00:20:50.964
Since I dropped you
off here this morning.


328
00:20:50.988 --> 00:20:53.028
Mm, you were just
in the neighborhood?


329
00:20:53.657 --> 00:20:55.497
Okay. Sounds creepy. Uh, no.

330
00:20:55.643 --> 00:20:57.585
I had coffee with rita

331
00:20:57.736 --> 00:20:59.881
And she told me you were
getting off work soon, so...


332
00:20:59.905 --> 00:21:01.088
Of course.

333
00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:02.959
Can I give you a lift?

334
00:21:03.426 --> 00:21:05.226
Sure. That would be great.

335
00:21:05.744 --> 00:21:06.744
All right!

336
00:21:09.173 --> 00:21:11.748
- You look nice.
- Thank you.


337
00:21:11.767 --> 00:21:14.009
I'm going to see <i>la vie en rose.</i>

338
00:21:14.103 --> 00:21:16.252
- With andrea bocelli?
- No.


339
00:21:16.347 --> 00:21:18.513
Uh, I did see him once

340
00:21:18.608 --> 00:21:21.091
Performing<i>la vie en rose</i> in
Italy, he was spectacular.


341
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.391
But no, this concert is
inspired by the same song.


342
00:21:25.356 --> 00:21:27.689
- Sounds fun.
- It is.


343
00:21:27.783 --> 00:21:30.284
Would you care to join me?

344
00:21:30.435 --> 00:21:32.177
To a concert?

345
00:21:32.196 --> 00:21:35.122
And I was hoping dinner,
which they're serving.


346
00:21:35.349 --> 00:21:37.418
I was going alone, but I
do have an extra ticket.


347
00:21:37.442 --> 00:21:39.562
And if you have no
plans, you should come.


348
00:21:41.446 --> 00:21:44.948
I have to go home
and get changed.


349
00:21:44.967 --> 00:21:47.087
I can drive you home
and you can get ready.


350
00:21:48.212 --> 00:21:50.195
Well, you twist my arm.

351
00:21:55.386 --> 00:21:56.960
You went from a boring,

352
00:21:56.979 --> 00:21:59.129
Mundane home and work
life with your cat...


353
00:21:59.223 --> 00:22:01.039
<i>- Hey!</i>
- To a full blown stalker


354
00:22:01.058 --> 00:22:03.484
And date night with the
most successful and sexy man


355
00:22:03.711 --> 00:22:04.751
We've met all year.

356
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.728
I'm nervous.

357
00:22:06.822 --> 00:22:08.230
<i>Well, don't be about arnie.</i>

358
00:22:08.382 --> 00:22:09.882
<i>The police are on it.</i>

359
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.641
<i>And the affidavit
was filed today</i>


360
00:22:11.661 --> 00:22:13.196
<i>To help in the
proceedings with maggie.</i>


361
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.311
Well, will he be
informed about it?


362
00:22:15.406 --> 00:22:18.314
Everything will be disclosed
to the court-appointed attorney


363
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:21.560
And she will inform him of a
witness statement, I'm sure.


364
00:22:21.653 --> 00:22:23.206
But who knows if he
even has an email


365
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.483
Or has been in contact with her?

366
00:22:24.507 --> 00:22:26.565
Okay.

367
00:22:26.658 --> 00:22:29.492
Well, I'm equally
nervous about this date.


368
00:22:29.512 --> 00:22:32.179
<i>So, what are you wearing?</i>

369
00:22:35.685 --> 00:22:36.685
This.

370
00:22:37.928 --> 00:22:39.594
You're kidding me, right?

371
00:22:39.747 --> 00:22:41.507
No. Look, it's cute on.

372
00:22:43.693 --> 00:22:45.526
Oh, full stop, sister.

373
00:22:46.437 --> 00:22:48.437
Please don't tell me

374
00:22:48.531 --> 00:22:51.940
That that's the undergarment
you're planning on wearing. Ugh!


375
00:22:52.034 --> 00:22:54.776
Oh, so, what, now you're
judging my panties and bra?


376
00:22:54.929 --> 00:22:58.688
Listen, I realize that you
haven't been on a date in years.


377
00:22:58.782 --> 00:23:00.243
More to the point, been laid.

378
00:23:00.267 --> 00:23:01.616
In years!

379
00:23:01.769 --> 00:23:04.360
So I forgive your
lack in judgment.


380
00:23:05.289 --> 00:23:08.457
<i>But trust me when I say we
have a lot of work to do.</i>


381
00:23:08.551 --> 00:23:10.551
<i>Now, take me to your closet.</i>

382
00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:18.392
Be careful. He sheds.

383
00:23:19.303 --> 00:23:20.310
Wow.

384
00:23:21.397 --> 00:23:23.647
- Too much?
- No.


385
00:23:24.567 --> 00:23:26.567
Um, you look stunning.

386
00:23:28.404 --> 00:23:29.570
Thank you.

387
00:23:33.133 --> 00:23:34.891
- Shall we?
- We shall.


388
00:23:42.084 --> 00:23:44.045
So, how many people would
you say that you know here?


389
00:23:44.069 --> 00:23:45.586
Oh, a few.

390
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:51.333
The host, some of his friends,
they're all collector of my art.


391
00:23:51.427 --> 00:23:53.227
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.


392
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.315
And you're from Italy?

393
00:23:55.339 --> 00:23:57.747
<i>Si.</i> Oh. The accent.

394
00:23:57.767 --> 00:24:00.601
- very strong accent.
- Mm.


395
00:24:00.828 --> 00:24:02.748
So what brings
you here to miami?


396
00:24:02.772 --> 00:24:08.066
Well, to be close to my aunt
lucia and my cousin, rita.


397
00:24:09.278 --> 00:24:10.760
My aunt moved here

398
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.504
When she married
my uncle francisco.


399
00:24:12.523 --> 00:24:15.616
I grew up in rome,
Italy, as an only child.


400
00:24:17.678 --> 00:24:20.954
Recently, I... I lost my
mother, a few years ago.


401
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:25.367
I just moved here to be
close to my family now.


402
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:27.110
I understand.

403
00:24:27.204 --> 00:24:28.212
That makes sense.

404
00:24:30.357 --> 00:24:32.448
Oh.

405
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.163
- Wow.
- Do you dance?


406
00:25:04.241 --> 00:25:06.121
- I do, but, uh...
- Oh, come on.


407
00:25:06.226 --> 00:25:07.795
- no, not like that.
- Oh, just follow me.


408
00:25:07.819 --> 00:25:09.706
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Let's go.


409
00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.730
- No, no, no, really, I...
- Just follow my lead.


410
00:26:48.253 --> 00:26:49.730
Do you know where
the bathroom is?


411
00:26:49.754 --> 00:26:51.587
Oh, uh, there are several.

412
00:26:51.682 --> 00:26:54.332
But, uh, the most beautiful
one is the one upstairs.


413
00:26:54.426 --> 00:26:56.426
You have to take
the glass elevator.


414
00:26:56.946 --> 00:26:59.262
- They have a glass elevator?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.


415
00:26:59.356 --> 00:27:00.817
Big waste of money, but yeah.

416
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:03.433
it's an experience.

417
00:27:03.527 --> 00:27:05.338
- I'll be back in a sec.
- Okay.


418
00:28:20.678 --> 00:28:22.195
I told ya.

419
00:28:22.347 --> 00:28:24.364
I ain't afraid of
no cops, doctor.


420
00:28:24.591 --> 00:28:27.016
And I ain't afraid of following
people to fancy parties


421
00:28:27.036 --> 00:28:29.196
'cause I ain't got
nothing but time to kill.


422
00:28:29.538 --> 00:28:30.538
Hello?

423
00:28:32.266 --> 00:28:33.593
What you aren't
seeming to understand


424
00:28:33.617 --> 00:28:34.686
<i>Is that I got nothing</i>

425
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.101
Left to lose in life.

426
00:28:36.194 --> 00:28:38.453
So you listen and
you listen good.


427
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:41.864
When you decide to mess
with someone's life,


428
00:28:41.884 --> 00:28:44.051
Someone's gonna mess with yours.

429
00:28:44.869 --> 00:28:47.370
Where's my wife?

430
00:29:16.493 --> 00:29:18.333
- Hope!
- James!


431
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.790
It was arnie. He
was right behind me!


432
00:29:20.814 --> 00:29:22.422
Is that him? Hey!

433
00:29:22.574 --> 00:29:23.902
Hey, let him
go, let him go.


434
00:29:44.947 --> 00:29:45.947
Feeling better?

435
00:29:46.615 --> 00:29:48.240
I am. Thank you.

436
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.844
This guy, what does
he want with you?


437
00:29:53.622 --> 00:29:57.182
I can't really discuss it, but
it has to do with his wife.


438
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.417
She's under protection
and a patient of mine.


439
00:30:01.371 --> 00:30:04.189
He blames me for
helping her find safety.


440
00:30:04.207 --> 00:30:05.207
Ah.

441
00:30:11.289 --> 00:30:12.329
Medical school, huh?

442
00:30:13.308 --> 00:30:14.308
It was intense.

443
00:30:16.478 --> 00:30:17.644
It was busy.

444
00:30:18.872 --> 00:30:20.205
I see.

445
00:30:20.223 --> 00:30:21.314
Any hobbies?

446
00:30:22.876 --> 00:30:24.209
Not really.

447
00:30:24.302 --> 00:30:26.262
No, "not really"
sounds like a yes


448
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.300
Disguised with an
embarrassed no.


449
00:30:28.382 --> 00:30:30.824
Considering you are
a successful artist,


450
00:30:31.051 --> 00:30:33.051
I feel kind of silly
answering that.


451
00:30:33.996 --> 00:30:35.478
You can tell me.

452
00:30:36.331 --> 00:30:40.983
Well, my favorite electives
in high school were art.


453
00:30:41.003 --> 00:30:43.319
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.


454
00:30:43.338 --> 00:30:45.839
And I took a few classes
in college as well.


455
00:30:47.158 --> 00:30:49.038
And then what happened?

456
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.178
Life.

457
00:30:59.413 --> 00:31:02.314
This guy harassing
you, stalking you,


458
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.526
I know it's not
easy and I'm sorry.


459
00:31:07.921 --> 00:31:11.031
it's
just a lot, you know?


460
00:31:12.092 --> 00:31:13.092
I mean...

461
00:31:15.186 --> 00:31:16.986
What does he want from me?

462
00:31:17.931 --> 00:31:20.091
The way that he looked
at me, it was like...


463
00:31:23.695 --> 00:31:25.495
Like he wanted to kill me.

464
00:31:27.441 --> 00:31:31.051
come over,
come here. Here.


465
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:36.223
This is just a moment in time.

466
00:31:37.726 --> 00:31:39.646
The police is going
to catch this guy.


467
00:31:40.395 --> 00:31:43.230
Okay? And all of this is
going to be behind you.


468
00:31:48.237 --> 00:31:49.237
I hope so.

469
00:31:51.465 --> 00:31:52.888
Now, do you want to sleep here?

470
00:31:52.908 --> 00:31:55.725
- Oh, I don't really...
- No, no, no.


471
00:31:55.819 --> 00:31:57.280
I didn't mean it that way.

472
00:31:57.304 --> 00:31:59.395
I mean, the thought of you

473
00:31:59.489 --> 00:32:00.874
Being home by yourself,

474
00:32:00.898 --> 00:32:02.778
It's just... doesn't feel safe.

475
00:32:03.585 --> 00:32:06.736
My guest room is
super comfortable.


476
00:32:06.755 --> 00:32:08.922
I mean, my aunt
tells me every time.


477
00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:11.259
What do you say?

478
00:32:12.594 --> 00:32:14.261
- Okay.
- Okay?


479
00:32:15.413 --> 00:32:17.213
Yeah, that's a good idea.

480
00:32:18.508 --> 00:32:21.417
So the face cloths are
over there in the closet.


481
00:32:21.436 --> 00:32:24.771
And, uh, at the bottom, we
have the towels for the shower.


482
00:32:26.424 --> 00:32:28.441
Thank you for everything.

483
00:32:28.593 --> 00:32:30.777
You're welcome. 
Anything else?

484
00:32:30.928 --> 00:32:33.429
Um, maybe a t-shirt for tonight.

485
00:32:34.265 --> 00:32:36.007
T-shirt for tonight? What
about tomorrow morning?


486
00:32:36.026 --> 00:32:37.786
Maybe a nice dress shirt?

487
00:32:38.345 --> 00:32:40.225
- That would be great.
- Noted.


488
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.955
T-shirt for tonight

489
00:32:42.182 --> 00:32:44.222
And a nice dress
shirt for the morning.


490
00:32:45.627 --> 00:32:48.277
I really appreciate everything
that you've done for me.


491
00:32:54.044 --> 00:32:56.044
You're very beautiful,
hope williams.


492
00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:27.075
Sweet dreams.

493
00:33:51.008 --> 00:33:52.750
Good morning.

494
00:35:37.023 --> 00:35:39.299
- Hey!
- Oh.


495
00:35:41.194 --> 00:35:44.804
I, um... I was just
looking for the bathroom.


496
00:35:44.956 --> 00:35:46.789
Well, you found it.

497
00:35:46.883 --> 00:35:49.367
- I did.
- Hey, wait.


498
00:35:49.385 --> 00:35:50.885
Come on in.

499
00:35:51.037 --> 00:35:53.054
- Come back here.
- Dah, I dunno!


500
00:35:53.206 --> 00:35:55.206
I got two showers, look.

501
00:35:56.893 --> 00:35:58.818
- You do.
- I don't bite.


502
00:35:59.713 --> 00:36:00.728
Okay.

503
00:36:38.342 --> 00:36:40.062
Can I scrub your back?

504
00:36:40.695 --> 00:36:42.011
sure.

505
00:38:04.687 --> 00:38:05.778
Enjoy your shower.

506
00:38:16.032 --> 00:38:17.032
I did.

507
00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.608
Thanks, detective.

508
00:38:19.628 --> 00:38:20.852
Okay.

509
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:22.036
Keep me posted.

510
00:38:22.188 --> 00:38:23.188
So?

511
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.709
Your cousin hasn't been
able to locate arnie.


512
00:38:28.803 --> 00:38:30.931
He's an electrician by
trade and self-employed


513
00:38:30.955 --> 00:38:33.197
And does these odd jobs.

514
00:38:33.216 --> 00:38:34.957
Lost his driver's license
almost a decade ago.


515
00:38:34.976 --> 00:38:37.012
And there's no home address
on file at the station


516
00:38:37.036 --> 00:38:38.870
Even though he has warrants out.

517
00:38:38.888 --> 00:38:41.389
Also looks like he's turned
off location services


518
00:38:41.541 --> 00:38:43.381
So the phone isn't trackable.

519
00:38:43.559 --> 00:38:45.393
I just feel so stupid.

520
00:38:45.545 --> 00:38:47.895
I didn't put a pass code
on my phone to protect it.


521
00:38:47.989 --> 00:38:50.548
- It makes me nervous.
- You know what I was thinking?


522
00:38:50.641 --> 00:38:53.660
I donate a lot to this outreach
program on the lower east side.


523
00:38:53.811 --> 00:38:56.645
And the founder is a
very good friend of mine.


524
00:38:56.739 --> 00:38:58.556
He knows a lot of people

525
00:38:58.574 --> 00:39:00.703
That get mixed up on the
wrong side of the law.


526
00:39:00.727 --> 00:39:02.129
So I'm thinking I'm
going to head down there


527
00:39:02.153 --> 00:39:03.819
And ask if he knows him.

528
00:39:03.838 --> 00:39:05.958
- What do you think?
- That would be great.


529
00:39:09.419 --> 00:39:11.219
This one looks good on you.

530
00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:14.663
It does.

531
00:39:14.683 --> 00:39:16.309
If the belt wasn't so thick,

532
00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:18.070
It might pass as an
outfit of my own.


533
00:39:18.094 --> 00:39:19.811
Mm, probably you're right.

534
00:39:22.248 --> 00:39:24.524
My shift starts at 8:00.
I should get going.


535
00:39:24.675 --> 00:39:25.692
It's okay.

536
00:39:27.344 --> 00:39:28.839
I can give you a ride back home.

537
00:39:28.863 --> 00:39:30.363
You can change.

538
00:39:30.514 --> 00:39:32.434
And then I can take you to work.

539
00:39:33.443 --> 00:39:36.018
I don't think I've had anyone
drive me around this much


540
00:39:36.112 --> 00:39:39.021
Since I was a kid getting hauled
around to sports practice.


541
00:39:39.115 --> 00:39:41.599
Let me guess, track.

542
00:39:41.617 --> 00:39:42.617
Hmm. You know it.

543
00:39:55.298 --> 00:39:57.798
Have you invited him
to the benefit yet?


544
00:39:57.951 --> 00:40:01.376
- James? No.
- why?


545
00:40:01.396 --> 00:40:03.098
Not sure we're in that stage

546
00:40:03.122 --> 00:40:05.732
Of me inviting him to
work events just yet.


547
00:40:05.959 --> 00:40:07.792
Hm.

548
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:09.605
I know you're going to
hate me for saying this,


549
00:40:09.629 --> 00:40:12.296
But I like seeing
this side of you.


550
00:40:12.315 --> 00:40:14.109
And what side of me is that?

551
00:40:14.133 --> 00:40:15.720
The one that's
getting some action.


552
00:40:17.136 --> 00:40:18.302
I'm serious.

553
00:40:18.321 --> 00:40:19.470
You're glowing.

554
00:40:19.489 --> 00:40:21.489
I will admit it's been...

555
00:40:21.583 --> 00:40:23.583
Fun meeting him.

556
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:26.455
He brings out a side of me

557
00:40:26.479 --> 00:40:28.399
That I didn't know
still existed.


558
00:40:28.739 --> 00:40:30.072
It just sucks I had to meet him

559
00:40:30.091 --> 00:40:32.051
Around all this
stuff with arnie.


560
00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:35.239
- You need to get a gun.
- A gun?


561
00:40:35.838 --> 00:40:37.321
I've never held a gun
in my entire life.


562
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.801
No. I'm not doing that.

563
00:40:38.825 --> 00:40:40.302
Okay, well, then, pepper spray.

564
00:40:40.326 --> 00:40:42.166
Pepper spray, I can handle.

565
00:40:44.606 --> 00:40:45.897
Here. Take mine.

566
00:40:50.503 --> 00:40:52.094
If you like last
week cheeseburgers,


567
00:40:52.113 --> 00:40:54.233
You gon' love this
southwestern jambalaya.


568
00:40:54.857 --> 00:40:56.577
Get it while it's hot.

569
00:40:56.859 --> 00:40:58.117
Well, well, well.

570
00:40:58.269 --> 00:41:00.189
Look at what the cat dragged in.

571
00:41:00.604 --> 00:41:02.484
- How are you, leo?
- Doing well.


572
00:41:03.032 --> 00:41:04.552
Hey, I'll be right back.

573
00:41:04.793 --> 00:41:05.793
Come on around.

574
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.331
Did you get that card I sent ya?

575
00:41:09.355 --> 00:41:11.166
The card? Oh, yes. Yes, I did.

576
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.691
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, no, no, no. Thank you.


577
00:41:13.709 --> 00:41:16.285
Your last donation
was very generous.


578
00:41:16.379 --> 00:41:18.620
It's 'cause of folks like you
we can keep this shelter goin'.


579
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.364
I'm happy to help.

580
00:41:20.457 --> 00:41:21.866
So what brings
you by here today?


581
00:41:21.884 --> 00:41:23.884
Arnie mcdougal.

582
00:41:24.037 --> 00:41:26.479
- Name ring a bell?
- Oh, yeah, I know arnie.


583
00:41:26.706 --> 00:41:28.826
He's done some work
for me over the years.


584
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.134
- Good electrician.
- Has he been around recently?


585
00:41:32.228 --> 00:41:34.636
Not since last year when I gave
him a bed for a few nights.


586
00:41:34.656 --> 00:41:36.525
A bed? Does he sleep
on the streets?


587
00:41:36.549 --> 00:41:37.549
No, no.

588
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.475
I gave it to him as a favor.

589
00:41:40.495 --> 00:41:42.662
Told me he and the
missus got into a fight


590
00:41:42.889 --> 00:41:44.457
And begged me to
let him stay here.


591
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:46.401
Said he had nowhere else to go.

592
00:41:46.726 --> 00:41:48.984
But he gave one of my
staffers quite the scare.


593
00:41:49.003 --> 00:41:51.298
And after that I told him he
couldn't come by here no more.


594
00:41:51.322 --> 00:41:53.242
- Sounds serious?
- Oh, yeah.


595
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:55.394
Say, what's this
all about, anyway?


596
00:41:55.418 --> 00:41:56.901
It's a long story, leo.

597
00:41:56.919 --> 00:41:58.714
It's got to do with
a friend of mine


598
00:41:58.738 --> 00:41:59.828
Who's trying to help his wife.

599
00:41:59.848 --> 00:42:01.648
And now he's stalking her.

600
00:42:01.741 --> 00:42:03.643
Stalking your friend
that's helping his wife?


601
00:42:03.667 --> 00:42:05.587
- Mm-hmm. Yup.
- Maggie mcdougal.


602
00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:09.263
Sweet lady. I
felt bad for her.


603
00:42:09.415 --> 00:42:11.255
Y'know, when we took him in,

604
00:42:11.342 --> 00:42:13.767
He called her down here to
come have a meal with him.


605
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.655
But the next thing you know,

606
00:42:15.679 --> 00:42:17.082
Gretchen, who works
in the kitchen...


607
00:42:17.106 --> 00:42:18.342
- Uh-huh.
- Walks in on him


608
00:42:18.366 --> 00:42:19.699
Choking her out.

609
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.403
She tried to break it up

610
00:42:21.427 --> 00:42:23.255
And he damn near
knocked her out, too.


611
00:42:23.279 --> 00:42:25.679
- So you called the cops?
- Of course I called the police.


612
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.099
But arnie was intense.

613
00:42:28.117 --> 00:42:29.117
Ragin' mad.

614
00:42:30.044 --> 00:42:31.747
Cops arrested him
right then and there


615
00:42:31.771 --> 00:42:33.731
For domestic and
assault on greta.


616
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:36.330
He got locked up for
a while, I think.


617
00:42:36.459 --> 00:42:38.217
But anyway, after that,

618
00:42:38.369 --> 00:42:40.180
I told him he was banned
from coming here ever again.


619
00:42:40.204 --> 00:42:41.888
Work or otherwise.

620
00:42:42.039 --> 00:42:44.093
Do you have an address
for him, by any chance?


621
00:42:44.117 --> 00:42:46.117
No. I don't keep
that kind of info.


622
00:42:46.895 --> 00:42:50.396
Any idea of any
friends he might have?


623
00:42:50.623 --> 00:42:52.101
He always struck me
as kind of a loner.


624
00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:53.190
Hmm. I see.

625
00:42:55.628 --> 00:42:57.719
Listen, if he comes
around by any chance,


626
00:42:57.739 --> 00:42:59.032
You drop me a line, okay?

627
00:42:59.056 --> 00:43:01.407
Will do. Hey, listen.

628
00:43:01.558 --> 00:43:03.629
I normally don't like
to talk ill of anybody,


629
00:43:03.653 --> 00:43:05.986
But arnie is dangerous.

630
00:43:06.139 --> 00:43:07.783
He's got a temper
that won't quit


631
00:43:07.807 --> 00:43:09.807
And he's capable of
hurtin' somebody.


632
00:43:09.825 --> 00:43:12.305
You need to tell that friend
of yours to steer clear of him.


633
00:43:12.587 --> 00:43:13.978
She's trying.

634
00:43:18.242 --> 00:43:19.719
- Good job in there.
- Thank you.


635
00:43:19.743 --> 00:43:21.919
- Can you hand...
- Thank you.


636
00:43:23.264 --> 00:43:25.624
- I want to speak with you.
- Jennifer. Everything okay?


637
00:43:25.675 --> 00:43:27.227
Why would you email me

638
00:43:27.251 --> 00:43:28.820
And not just pick
up a phone to call,


639
00:43:28.844 --> 00:43:29.827
Like a normal human being?

640
00:43:29.845 --> 00:43:31.328
Excuse me?

641
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:32.732
Is that why he suggested

642
00:43:32.756 --> 00:43:34.309
That we honor you
at the benefit?


643
00:43:34.333 --> 00:43:36.609
Why he suggested
that we invite you


644
00:43:36.836 --> 00:43:39.170
To james sosa's art
gallery opening?


645
00:43:39.263 --> 00:43:41.113
What are you trying to do?

646
00:43:41.265 --> 00:43:43.585
Are you trying to destroy
my children's and my life?


647
00:43:44.677 --> 00:43:46.953
I honestly don't know
what this is about.


648
00:43:55.037 --> 00:43:56.295
I didn't send these.

649
00:43:56.447 --> 00:43:58.372
Is that not you email address?

650
00:43:58.524 --> 00:44:00.644
Come on, hope. Stop
playing games with me.


651
00:44:02.136 --> 00:44:04.786
Please, just come into my
office and I can explain.


652
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.806
Explain? You mean deny.

653
00:44:06.957 --> 00:44:08.641
Just like jeremy is.

654
00:44:08.792 --> 00:44:09.791
This is completely
unprofessional.


655
00:44:09.811 --> 00:44:11.535
You know that, right?

656
00:44:11.554 --> 00:44:13.628
I will have your
medical license revoked


657
00:44:13.648 --> 00:44:15.815
And I will cancel
the stupid benefit.


658
00:44:15.966 --> 00:44:18.542
My phone was stolen
a couple days ago.


659
00:44:18.635 --> 00:44:20.395
- Oh...
- It's complicated.


660
00:44:20.488 --> 00:44:22.546
Please, just come into my
office and I can explain.


661
00:44:22.565 --> 00:44:25.825
I swear, I'm not having an
affair with your husband.


662
00:44:25.976 --> 00:44:27.696
Come into my office, okay?

663
00:45:10.187 --> 00:45:11.662
There you are.

664
00:45:13.357 --> 00:45:15.041
Come on.

665
00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:17.334
You already ate.

666
00:45:18.212 --> 00:45:19.453
Let's go to bed.

667
00:45:47.575 --> 00:45:48.741
Stay here.

668
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.497
Real nice place
you got here, doc.


669
00:46:20.516 --> 00:46:24.777
Not so much from
outside, but in here,


670
00:46:24.928 --> 00:46:27.838
You know, looks good.

671
00:46:27.857 --> 00:46:29.406
Looks fancy.

672
00:46:32.954 --> 00:46:34.120
Rich.

673
00:46:35.772 --> 00:46:38.699
You need to leave
my home, arnie.


674
00:46:38.851 --> 00:46:40.126
I'll leave.

675
00:46:40.277 --> 00:46:42.035
As soon as you tell me

676
00:46:42.188 --> 00:46:44.188
Where you'd send my maggie to.

677
00:46:44.206 --> 00:46:46.799
And ya take back that statement
I saw ya made to the judge.


678
00:46:47.026 --> 00:46:49.186
Do those two things,
and I'm outta your hair.


679
00:46:49.879 --> 00:46:51.804
You need to leave,

680
00:46:52.031 --> 00:46:53.697
And you need to give
me back my phone.


681
00:46:53.716 --> 00:46:55.476
The one that you stole.

682
00:46:57.553 --> 00:46:59.953
You know my daughter's not
talkin' to me because of you?


683
00:47:00.389 --> 00:47:01.389
Did you know that?

684
00:47:01.983 --> 00:47:03.891
I have nothing to do

685
00:47:03.985 --> 00:47:06.296
With who in your family
isn't talking to you, arnie.


686
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.320
You can't blame me
for your choices.


687
00:47:09.139 --> 00:47:11.019
I'm just trying to do my job.

688
00:47:11.325 --> 00:47:12.883
Your job?!

689
00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:41.498
<i>9-1-1,
what's your emergency?</i>


690
00:47:44.525 --> 00:47:46.525
Just get the
bag to evidence.


691
00:47:52.274 --> 00:47:53.314
How are you feeling?

692
00:47:54.702 --> 00:47:57.277
Still in a bit of
a daze, I suppose.


693
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:58.929
I'm gonna leave an
officer outside your home


694
00:47:58.948 --> 00:48:00.668
For the next few days.

695
00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.948
I don't want you here if
you don't see our car.


696
00:48:03.026 --> 00:48:05.004
Do you have any
leads on where he is?


697
00:48:05.028 --> 00:48:07.068
- Anything?
- It's been difficult.


698
00:48:07.623 --> 00:48:09.342
His ex-wife gave
him a kick-out order


699
00:48:09.366 --> 00:48:11.291
From the apartment they shared.

700
00:48:11.444 --> 00:48:13.794
I talked to the landlord
and she said he was served


701
00:48:13.946 --> 00:48:16.889
And she got his keys back, so
not likely that he's there.


702
00:48:18.133 --> 00:48:20.801
My guess, he's
staying with a friend.


703
00:48:20.895 --> 00:48:23.120
And figuring out who
would be a friend of his,


704
00:48:23.138 --> 00:48:24.138
Hasn't been easy.

705
00:48:25.624 --> 00:48:27.377
Did he say what he
wanted with you?


706
00:48:27.401 --> 00:48:29.977
Anything that might help
point me in a direction?


707
00:48:30.129 --> 00:48:32.813
Just that he wanted to
know where his wife was.


708
00:48:32.907 --> 00:48:34.965
And that he wants me to give
back the statement I gave


709
00:48:34.984 --> 00:48:36.909
With respect to his wife

710
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.460
And what she shared with me
about the domestic violence.


711
00:48:39.822 --> 00:48:42.142
And, as a physician, what
I treated her for and saw.


712
00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.120
But I just can't, you know?

713
00:48:45.144 --> 00:48:46.252
I mean,

714
00:48:48.147 --> 00:48:50.049
If he is capable of terrorizing
me the way that he has,


715
00:48:50.073 --> 00:48:52.553
Then I can't imagine what he
would do to her if he found her.


716
00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.746
Especially now that
she's left him for good.


717
00:48:57.765 --> 00:49:00.224
It's very brave of you not
to have given him the info.


718
00:49:01.494 --> 00:49:02.614
Most people would have.

719
00:49:04.513 --> 00:49:06.308
Did he get in through
the back door?


720
00:49:06.332 --> 00:49:09.257
The security system.
Seems he knew the code.


721
00:49:09.277 --> 00:49:11.835
of course.

722
00:49:11.928 --> 00:49:13.854
It was in my notes in my phone

723
00:49:14.006 --> 00:49:15.817
And I didn't have
the pass code on.


724
00:49:15.841 --> 00:49:17.174
Okay.

725
00:49:17.192 --> 00:49:19.112
Well, looks like
we're done here.


726
00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:20.953
Get some sleep.

727
00:49:21.104 --> 00:49:22.582
We'll touch base in the morning.

728
00:49:22.606 --> 00:49:24.939
And get your
landline fixed asap.


729
00:49:24.959 --> 00:49:27.240
And your cell phone, keep
it with you at all times.


730
00:49:27.277 --> 00:49:28.585
I will.

731
00:49:29.297 --> 00:49:30.421
Thank you, rita.

732
00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:32.781
You're welcome.

733
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:48.963
Hello?

734
00:49:48.983 --> 00:49:50.316
Hello.

735
00:49:51.894 --> 00:49:53.094
I hope I'm not interrupting.

736
00:49:54.471 --> 00:49:56.471
- These are for you.
- For?


737
00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:57.570
Oh, they were on sale.

738
00:49:58.326 --> 00:49:59.900
I'm just kidding.

739
00:50:00.052 --> 00:50:01.810
Because you deserve it.

740
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:03.709
- They're gorgeous.
- Thank you.


741
00:50:05.574 --> 00:50:07.369
You know, I don't remember

742
00:50:07.393 --> 00:50:09.150
The last time I was
in a doctor's office.


743
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:10.630
- Really?
- Yeah, I was a kid.


744
00:50:10.654 --> 00:50:12.579
When I was nine years old.

745
00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:14.840
- For what?
- Tonsillitis.


746
00:50:14.991 --> 00:50:16.917
- Oh, I see.
- Mm-hmm.


747
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:19.494
I'm better now.

748
00:50:19.513 --> 00:50:21.873
oh. Sorry to interrupt. Um...

749
00:50:23.075 --> 00:50:24.350
Here you go.

750
00:50:24.577 --> 00:50:25.576
And?

751
00:50:25.594 --> 00:50:26.760
Eloquent.

752
00:50:26.912 --> 00:50:28.145
And from the heart.

753
00:50:30.674 --> 00:50:32.749
Eloquent and from the heart.

754
00:50:32.768 --> 00:50:35.602
Did you just write your first
novel and that's the prologue?


755
00:50:35.696 --> 00:50:38.772
It's my speech for this
thing tomorrow night.


756
00:50:38.924 --> 00:50:41.258
Thing. Thing. You know,
things are interesting.


757
00:50:41.276 --> 00:50:42.776
And, uh, so what thing?

758
00:50:42.928 --> 00:50:44.185
A foundation I'm associated with

759
00:50:44.205 --> 00:50:45.907
Is honoring me for the work

760
00:50:45.931 --> 00:50:47.409
That I've been doing
for women's health.


761
00:50:47.433 --> 00:50:49.335
And what foundation
would that be?


762
00:50:49.359 --> 00:50:50.399
Cooper and davidson.

763
00:50:52.195 --> 00:50:54.213
- what?
- What?


764
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.030
You don't remember
the first time we met?


765
00:50:56.050 --> 00:51:00.219
- The coopers. Your opening.
- Yes.


766
00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:03.463
And here I thought you just
fixed their daughter's arm.


767
00:51:03.616 --> 00:51:04.848
No big deal.

768
00:51:06.285 --> 00:51:07.285
Arnie.

769
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:09.931
- What's wrong?
- He sent emails to them.


770
00:51:09.955 --> 00:51:11.858
To jennifer cooper,
pretending to be me,


771
00:51:11.882 --> 00:51:13.935
Saying that I'm having an
affair with her husband.


772
00:51:13.959 --> 00:51:16.126
- An affair with her husband?
- Yeah.


773
00:51:16.145 --> 00:51:19.238
It's not true, though. She...
he's been tormenting me.


774
00:51:19.389 --> 00:51:21.222
I think I cleared it up,
but for a minute there,


775
00:51:21.242 --> 00:51:22.908
She didn't believe me.

776
00:51:23.135 --> 00:51:25.255
I mean, embarrassing
is an understatement.


777
00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.563
They invited me.

778
00:51:28.657 --> 00:51:31.308
I didn't realize it was
honoring you until this morning


779
00:51:31.401 --> 00:51:33.735
When I re-read the invitation,

780
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:35.662
But, um, I bought a table.

781
00:51:35.814 --> 00:51:38.498
I made a sizeable donation.

782
00:51:38.651 --> 00:51:41.001
Thank you, for your donation.

783
00:51:41.745 --> 00:51:43.055
And I'm pretty
sure I can clear up


784
00:51:43.079 --> 00:51:45.079
All misconceptions
with the coopers.


785
00:51:45.658 --> 00:51:46.658
Trust me.

786
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:50.161
I trust you.

787
00:51:55.258 --> 00:51:56.758
In closing, I just want to say

788
00:51:56.777 --> 00:51:59.111
Thank you for honoring
me this evening.


789
00:52:00.689 --> 00:52:03.431
I'm thankful that I've been able
to contribute to women's health


790
00:52:03.451 --> 00:52:05.099
And be a part of a foundation

791
00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:08.011
That continues to raise
funds for research


792
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:11.248
That is imperative for
our daughters of tomorrow.


793
00:52:12.685 --> 00:52:15.702
As the daughter of a
breast cancer warrior,


794
00:52:15.796 --> 00:52:18.964
I will continue to do
my best, digging deeper,


795
00:52:19.115 --> 00:52:22.134
So that one day we
will have the cure.


796
00:52:35.557 --> 00:52:37.891
Hey. Oh, my god.

797
00:52:38.043 --> 00:52:39.985
Great job up there.

798
00:52:40.136 --> 00:52:42.212
- Not too long?
- It was perfect.


799
00:52:42.231 --> 00:52:44.881
Jennifer and jeremy haven't
looked at me all night.


800
00:52:44.975 --> 00:52:46.861
It was on my mind
the entire time.


801
00:52:46.885 --> 00:52:48.621
You've explained
everything to them.


802
00:52:48.645 --> 00:52:50.387
There's nothing more you can do.

803
00:52:50.405 --> 00:52:52.458
You should've read the
messages that he sent her.


804
00:52:52.482 --> 00:52:54.522
I mean, explicit is
an understatement.


805
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.819
And dr. Brown was there
when she accused me.


806
00:52:57.913 --> 00:53:00.564
You're the guest of honor.
People are gonna stare at you.


807
00:53:00.657 --> 00:53:02.537
Okay. Now take a deep breath.

808
00:53:03.919 --> 00:53:05.177
Good.

809
00:53:05.328 --> 00:53:06.368
Maybe you're right.

810
00:53:07.181 --> 00:53:08.641
Arnie is making me paranoid.

811
00:53:08.665 --> 00:53:10.924
I feel like I'm
perpetually on edge.


812
00:53:11.076 --> 00:53:14.261
Now, here's someone who can
give you a little de-stressing.


813
00:53:14.413 --> 00:53:15.982
Ladies, good evening.

814
00:53:16.006 --> 00:53:18.598
Hello.

815
00:53:18.751 --> 00:53:21.009
Well, if you'll excuse me,

816
00:53:21.103 --> 00:53:23.770
I think I spot a handsome,
single man amidst the crowd


817
00:53:23.922 --> 00:53:25.509
That needs my legal advice.

818
00:53:27.276 --> 00:53:28.592
It was a pleasure to see you.

819
00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:29.610
You as well.

820
00:53:33.857 --> 00:53:36.099
Well, it was a wonderful speech.

821
00:53:36.118 --> 00:53:37.934
Thank you.

822
00:53:39.547 --> 00:53:41.213
The '80s.

823
00:53:41.364 --> 00:53:42.714
Maybe late '80s?

824
00:53:44.626 --> 00:53:46.367
I love this song.

825
00:53:46.461 --> 00:53:48.221
Would you like to dance?

826
00:53:48.964 --> 00:53:51.017
We've been doin' a
lot of dancin' lately.


827
00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:52.801
I'll take that as a yes.

828
00:54:22.314 --> 00:54:24.314
- It was a great party, hey?
- It was.


829
00:54:29.579 --> 00:54:30.659
Early shift tomorrow?

830
00:54:31.581 --> 00:54:32.598
Every day.

831
00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:39.587
What are you doing?

832
00:54:39.607 --> 00:54:40.939
Just feeling inspired.

833
00:54:43.426 --> 00:54:45.611
You're not sketching
me, are you?


834
00:54:45.762 --> 00:54:46.903
What if I was?

835
00:54:48.949 --> 00:54:52.008
It's just that I'm
not very photogenic.


836
00:54:53.103 --> 00:54:55.846
Lucky for you this is...
This is not photography.


837
00:54:58.183 --> 00:54:59.936
I really don't
think you want to.


838
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.120
Make a portrait
of you? Oh, but I do.


839
00:55:05.966 --> 00:55:06.966
Okay.

840
00:55:08.284 --> 00:55:10.124
Only if I can make
one of you, too.


841
00:55:10.804 --> 00:55:11.804
At the same time.

842
00:55:13.456 --> 00:55:15.376
You wanna make a portrait of me?

843
00:55:16.644 --> 00:55:18.718
Okay. You're on.

844
00:55:18.871 --> 00:55:19.871
Good.

845
00:55:32.718 --> 00:55:34.067
Your shirt.

846
00:55:34.161 --> 00:55:35.161
What about it?

847
00:55:37.406 --> 00:55:38.664
Can you unbutton it?

848
00:55:45.063 --> 00:55:47.183
What about your dress?
Are you comfortable?


849
00:55:48.917 --> 00:55:51.343
It is a little awkward.

850
00:55:52.179 --> 00:55:53.845
How about,

851
00:55:54.072 --> 00:55:56.497
You're going to change
into the nice shirt


852
00:55:56.517 --> 00:55:59.643
That you kindly
washed and returned.


853
00:56:00.354 --> 00:56:01.478
Okay.

854
00:56:23.618 --> 00:56:24.859
Feeling better?

855
00:56:27.272 --> 00:56:28.380
Much.

856
00:59:30.063 --> 00:59:31.063
Anyways.

857
00:59:31.714 --> 00:59:32.754
What time is it at?

858
00:59:35.551 --> 00:59:38.069
Okay, yeah, I can be
there in about 10 minutes.


859
00:59:38.221 --> 00:59:39.571
Yes. Walking.

860
00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.798
Mm-hmm.

861
00:59:41.891 --> 00:59:43.444
Also, do you think
that you can...


862
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:47.820
Hope?

863
00:59:47.973 --> 00:59:49.080
Hope, are you there?

864
00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:57.590
You okay?

865
01:00:11.104 --> 01:00:12.104
Hey there, hope.

866
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:14.606
Detective rollins?

867
01:00:16.259 --> 01:00:18.139
- What happened?
- You were hit.


868
01:00:18.946 --> 01:00:20.336
By arnie.

869
01:00:20.355 --> 01:00:21.595
I remember.

870
01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:24.783
- You saw him?
- I did.


871
01:00:24.934 --> 01:00:26.912
You were on a call with
nurse greer when it happened.


872
01:00:26.936 --> 01:00:29.287
Luckily a pedestrian was
there and scared him off.


873
01:00:30.457 --> 01:00:31.537
How's your head feel?

874
01:00:32.626 --> 01:00:34.292
Hurts.

875
01:00:34.519 --> 01:00:37.020
He's a sneaky little
snake, that's for sure.


876
01:00:37.038 --> 01:00:39.258
I can tell you I've never
had a case like this.


877
01:00:39.282 --> 01:00:41.162
I should've caught him by now.

878
01:00:41.359 --> 01:00:43.710
But he keeps just, I
don't know, hiding.


879
01:00:43.862 --> 01:00:44.862
And well.

880
01:00:45.697 --> 01:00:47.497
What about his... her phone.

881
01:00:48.216 --> 01:00:49.307
Can you get it?

882
01:00:50.368 --> 01:00:51.368
What is it?

883
01:00:53.129 --> 01:00:54.795
Nothing, I'm just, um, concerned

884
01:00:54.815 --> 01:00:57.131
That he has all your
personal information.


885
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:59.633
I know, but until we find it,
there isn't much we can do.


886
01:00:59.653 --> 01:01:01.653
In your technology department,

887
01:01:01.804 --> 01:01:03.471
There isn't a way to
lock down my phone


888
01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:05.639
So he doesn't have
access to it anymore?


889
01:01:05.659 --> 01:01:07.141
It's an unlocked phone.
Nothing we can do.


890
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.787
I mean, we keep
getting sightings,


891
01:01:08.811 --> 01:01:10.456
But by the time we
get there, he's gone.


892
01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:12.366
Look, I understand
your frustration.


893
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:13.498
I really do.

894
01:01:13.649 --> 01:01:15.074
Get some rest.

895
01:01:15.168 --> 01:01:16.168
I'll be in touch.

896
01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:20.396
What about his home? The
one he shared with maggie.


897
01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:22.565
I know you said that they
gave him a kick-out order,


898
01:01:22.584 --> 01:01:24.212
And gave back his keys,
but it might be...


899
01:01:24.236 --> 01:01:27.178
I assure you,
hope, we are on it.


900
01:01:40.752 --> 01:01:41.752
A break?

901
01:01:42.529 --> 01:01:43.603
Bruised.

902
01:01:43.697 --> 01:01:44.988
And badly.

903
01:01:46.849 --> 01:01:48.516
I didn't want to
mention anything


904
01:01:48.535 --> 01:01:50.680
In front of the detective
because she's you're, um...


905
01:01:50.704 --> 01:01:53.596
- She's what?
- She's your boyfriend's sister.


906
01:01:53.689 --> 01:01:56.041
Cousin. He's not my boyfriend.

907
01:01:56.192 --> 01:01:59.044
And it's not my
business, but, um...


908
01:02:02.123 --> 01:02:03.883
What is going on, greer?

909
01:02:05.218 --> 01:02:07.719
He accessed your
email database again.


910
01:02:08.889 --> 01:02:11.614
- And you know this because?
- A video.


911
01:02:11.633 --> 01:02:14.634
Emailed this morning the
minute you were admitted


912
01:02:14.786 --> 01:02:16.619
To the entire nursing staff.

913
01:02:16.638 --> 01:02:17.896
All doctors.

914
01:02:18.899 --> 01:02:21.048
I think pretty much
everyone that works here.


915
01:02:21.068 --> 01:02:24.027
- A video of what?
- You. And james sosa.


916
01:02:25.221 --> 01:02:27.647
In a very compromising position.

917
01:02:27.741 --> 01:02:29.056
To say the least.

918
01:02:29.076 --> 01:02:30.558
You're kidding me.

919
01:02:30.577 --> 01:02:32.577
I wish
I was. Trust me.


920
01:02:34.472 --> 01:02:36.823
- Where are you going?
- To my office.


921
01:02:36.917 --> 01:02:38.877
I think I have a change
of clothes in there.


922
01:02:38.901 --> 01:02:40.379
You really shouldn't
be moving around.


923
01:02:40.403 --> 01:02:42.214
I'm going to tell administration

924
01:02:42.238 --> 01:02:44.383
To take me off my rotation
today and tomorrow.


925
01:02:44.407 --> 01:02:46.207
My ribs need time to heal.

926
01:02:46.318 --> 01:02:48.198
- Of course.
- Excuse me.


927
01:03:18.683 --> 01:03:20.533
Hey.

928
01:03:20.627 --> 01:03:22.271
Uh, rita just called me
and told me what happened.


929
01:03:22.295 --> 01:03:23.353
Are you okay?

930
01:03:23.371 --> 01:03:25.204
I'm fine. Really.

931
01:03:25.298 --> 01:03:27.632
It's just a bruised rib
cage. Nothing's broken.


932
01:03:27.783 --> 01:03:29.595
<i>It's mild. I'm fine. Really.</i>

933
01:03:29.619 --> 01:03:31.027
Okay, I'll come
by. Where are you?


934
01:03:31.045 --> 01:03:33.954
No, no, no. Uh,

935
01:03:33.974 --> 01:03:36.048
- It's fine. I...
- Are you home?


936
01:03:36.201 --> 01:03:38.179
- I'm gonna bring you some food.
- No, no, no.


937
01:03:38.203 --> 01:03:41.371
I'm just, uh... I'm just
looking into something.


938
01:03:41.389 --> 01:03:43.797
Looking into something?
Where are you, hope?


939
01:03:43.817 --> 01:03:45.519
I have to go. I'll
call you back.


940
01:05:52.595 --> 01:05:55.187
Hey. Keep it down,
all right, will ya?


941
01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:57.260
Every frickin' day with you two.

942
01:06:35.396 --> 01:06:37.572
Hey! Hey! Come here!

943
01:06:46.816 --> 01:06:49.500
Open the door,
doc. Open the door.


944
01:06:49.727 --> 01:06:51.410
Open the damn door.

945
01:06:51.504 --> 01:06:53.821
Come on.

946
01:07:12.842 --> 01:07:14.984
Oh, shoot.

947
01:07:16.938 --> 01:07:19.197
- Hope williams?
- I am.


948
01:07:20.683 --> 01:07:23.016
She's here. Copy
that. Sure will.


949
01:07:23.036 --> 01:07:24.852
You had a lot of people worried.

950
01:07:24.871 --> 01:07:26.762
My apologies.

951
01:07:26.781 --> 01:07:28.017
Okay, well, I'm gonna
be out front here


952
01:07:28.041 --> 01:07:29.932
For the rest of the day.

953
01:07:29.951 --> 01:07:31.434
You let me know if
you're heading out again.


954
01:07:31.452 --> 01:07:33.026
We just want to make
sure you're safe.


955
01:07:33.046 --> 01:07:34.339
I will. And I appreciate that.

956
01:07:34.363 --> 01:07:35.713
Thank you.

957
01:08:06.562 --> 01:08:08.729
I thought you might
need some cheering up.


958
01:08:08.748 --> 01:08:11.323
- Is this from?
- My opening.


959
01:08:11.476 --> 01:08:13.196
Yes, it looks like it.

960
01:08:14.754 --> 01:08:16.421
Actually, no.

961
01:08:16.648 --> 01:08:19.482
No, this one is the
one that you started.


962
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.629
Remember, the very first
time you came to my house.


963
01:08:21.653 --> 01:08:22.693
I just finished it.

964
01:08:24.822 --> 01:08:26.505
"in skirts."

965
01:08:26.658 --> 01:08:29.175
Yes, I know how much you
loved "the provocateur,"


966
01:08:29.327 --> 01:08:32.687
Um, so I decided to go
with something similar.


967
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:35.106
- May I?
- Yeah.


968
01:08:37.502 --> 01:08:38.502
Okay.

969
01:08:43.599 --> 01:08:45.399
Is this supposed to be me?

970
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:46.842
Mm-hmm. In a skirt.

971
01:08:49.271 --> 01:08:51.008
Can I get you
something to drink?


972
01:08:51.032 --> 01:08:52.601
- Sure, water.
- Water.


973
01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:54.265
- Okay.
- Thank you.


974
01:08:56.129 --> 01:08:57.253
So, how are you feeling?

975
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:59.189
Great.

976
01:08:59.632 --> 01:09:01.357
Great.

977
01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:03.450
This is the first
time I hear a woman


978
01:09:03.544 --> 01:09:05.339
That just got hit on the ribs

979
01:09:05.363 --> 01:09:07.283
Saying that she's feeling great.

980
01:09:07.623 --> 01:09:08.881
Thank you.

981
01:09:09.033 --> 01:09:10.624
I got my phone back.

982
01:09:10.643 --> 01:09:12.310
They found it.

983
01:09:12.461 --> 01:09:14.105
I went to his apartment today.

984
01:09:14.129 --> 01:09:16.481
- Whose apartment?
- Arnie mcdougal's.


985
01:09:17.375 --> 01:09:19.558
- You could've been killed.
- But I wasn't.


986
01:09:19.652 --> 01:09:23.154
Listen, I've done everything
by the books here with arnie.


987
01:09:23.305 --> 01:09:26.157
And there just comes a
time when enough is enough.


988
01:09:26.384 --> 01:09:28.028
And I know that the
police wouldn't be able


989
01:09:28.052 --> 01:09:30.143
To search his place
without a warrant, so...


990
01:09:30.163 --> 01:09:31.957
- You decided to yourself?
- Yes.


991
01:09:31.981 --> 01:09:33.458
And I got my phone back

992
01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:34.960
And now that bastard
can't disrupt


993
01:09:34.984 --> 01:09:36.904
My professional life any longer.

994
01:09:37.745 --> 01:09:41.397
- He sent a video, james.
- What?


995
01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:43.841
Of you and me together
at your place.


996
01:09:46.328 --> 01:09:49.472
Sent to the entire
staff at my hospital.


997
01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:54.426
He was outside watching us,

998
01:09:54.579 --> 01:09:56.557
So I took matters
into my own hands


999
01:09:56.581 --> 01:09:58.661
And now all rita has
to do is catch him.


1000
01:10:02.695 --> 01:10:03.695
But he saw me.

1001
01:10:05.698 --> 01:10:06.989
At his apartment.

1002
01:10:09.184 --> 01:10:11.224
And I know he's going
to come looking.


1003
01:10:13.614 --> 01:10:16.999
I think I need to hide
out until he's caught.


1004
01:10:19.361 --> 01:10:20.461
Grab your purse.

1005
01:10:21.455 --> 01:10:22.547
I know the place.

1006
01:10:22.774 --> 01:10:23.939
Where are we going?

1007
01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:25.550
Somewhere safe.

1008
01:10:33.451 --> 01:10:35.186
- Wow!
- Yup.


1009
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:37.010
This place never gets old.

1010
01:10:37.379 --> 01:10:39.190
I've always wanted to
come here, but I...


1011
01:10:39.214 --> 01:10:41.101
You never found the time, right?

1012
01:10:41.125 --> 01:10:43.309
Not into alligators.

1013
01:10:43.461 --> 01:10:45.719
I don't think I ever met
anyone that is into alligators.


1014
01:10:45.738 --> 01:10:48.314
Brian. Hope. Hope.
Brian. Here's the boat.


1015
01:10:48.466 --> 01:10:50.386
Everything's ready
for you, boss.


1016
01:10:50.818 --> 01:10:54.745
Um, I... I don't know
if I'm up for this.


1017
01:10:56.249 --> 01:10:58.641
Hope, you're brave enough
to break into the apartment


1018
01:10:58.734 --> 01:11:00.400
Of the man that is
trying to kill you,


1019
01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.580
But you won't jump on
a little boat with me?


1020
01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.423
A boat in a swamp with
hungry alligators.


1021
01:11:06.259 --> 01:11:08.299
I've seen way too
many documentaries.


1022
01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:10.169
Just trust me.

1023
01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:36.680
How much?

1024
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:38.539
How much ya got?

1025
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:14.383
How did you
find this place?


1026
01:12:14.402 --> 01:12:16.476
I'm an
investor. We built it.


1027
01:12:16.496 --> 01:12:18.496
- This is a sanctuary.
- Wow!


1028
01:12:19.573 --> 01:12:21.557
Here we go.

1029
01:12:21.575 --> 01:12:23.895
So, you never told me, what
made you become a doctor?


1030
01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.707
I guess I decided
when I was a teenager.


1031
01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:27.730
Hmm.

1032
01:12:27.748 --> 01:12:29.064
My mom became ill

1033
01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:30.675
And developed breast cancer.

1034
01:12:32.161 --> 01:12:33.569
I remember sitting by her side

1035
01:12:33.587 --> 01:12:35.680
As she spent countless hours

1036
01:12:35.831 --> 01:12:39.241
Researching and
researching why her,


1037
01:12:39.334 --> 01:12:40.979
And how the cancer developed.

1038
01:12:41.003 --> 01:12:44.004
I mean, she was
active and healthy


1039
01:12:44.023 --> 01:12:47.750
And she just never could find
the answer she was seeking.


1040
01:12:47.768 --> 01:12:50.436
- I see.
- Yeah.


1041
01:12:50.588 --> 01:12:54.590
And after, you know, two
years of fighting it,


1042
01:12:54.608 --> 01:12:55.608
The cancer won.

1043
01:12:59.688 --> 01:13:01.430
I know your mom would
be proud of you.


1044
01:13:01.449 --> 01:13:02.856
- I hope you know that.
- Hmm.


1045
01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:04.675
I think she would be, too.

1046
01:13:05.453 --> 01:13:07.133
Let's go. This way.

1047
01:13:14.369 --> 01:13:15.778
Where are we going?

1048
01:13:15.796 --> 01:13:17.556
Almost there. Just come.

1049
01:13:21.969 --> 01:13:22.969
Wow.

1050
01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:27.791
Wow.

1051
01:13:35.074 --> 01:13:36.874
Is that a pottery machine?

1052
01:13:36.968 --> 01:13:39.635
- It is.
- From your sketches.


1053
01:13:39.653 --> 01:13:42.321
You did one of a man and
a woman making pottery.


1054
01:13:42.415 --> 01:13:43.415
Nina loved it.

1055
01:13:45.067 --> 01:13:46.208
You have good memory.

1056
01:13:49.422 --> 01:13:50.755
This place is magical.

1057
01:13:51.983 --> 01:13:54.925
Now, what are you gonna make?

1058
01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.262
It's more like
what won't I make?


1059
01:13:59.414 --> 01:14:01.156
Just dip your hands
into the water


1060
01:14:01.175 --> 01:14:03.015
And put some water in there.

1061
01:14:04.086 --> 01:14:05.989
Mm-hmm. Now you
can use the pedal.


1062
01:14:06.013 --> 01:14:07.938
Yep. You're doing good.

1063
01:14:09.609 --> 01:14:10.941
Slowly. Slowly.

1064
01:14:17.691 --> 01:14:18.949
You wanna sit down?

1065
01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.620
Yes. Yes.

1066
01:14:24.348 --> 01:14:25.348
Look at you.

1067
01:14:26.793 --> 01:14:27.793
Mm-hmm.

1068
01:14:51.484 --> 01:14:53.284
How's this? Is this okay?

1069
01:15:58.551 --> 01:16:00.200
This could get messy.

1070
01:16:00.294 --> 01:16:01.719
That's why we have water.

1071
01:16:18.053 --> 01:16:19.069
That was fun.

1072
01:16:20.464 --> 01:16:21.464
It was.

1073
01:16:25.486 --> 01:16:27.560
- Are you hungry?
- Starving.


1074
01:16:27.655 --> 01:16:30.139
- Starving?
- Mm-hmm.


1075
01:16:30.157 --> 01:16:32.357
I have something for
you. I'll be right back.


1076
01:17:10.181 --> 01:17:11.363
Oh, my god.

1077
01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.166
Come on. Come on.

1078
01:19:00.215 --> 01:19:01.690
Where ya at, doc?

1079
01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:08.445
Just come on out,
I know you're here.


1080
01:19:10.725 --> 01:19:12.445
Got my bat here again.

1081
01:19:14.305 --> 01:19:16.745
Bought this beauty when my
daughter was just a little girl.


1082
01:19:18.809 --> 01:19:20.929
Taught her how to play
this sport with it.


1083
01:19:24.315 --> 01:19:26.596
You wouldn't understand
'cause you got no family.


1084
01:19:29.486 --> 01:19:30.719
For me...

1085
01:19:33.006 --> 01:19:34.264
My family's everything.

1086
01:19:35.917 --> 01:19:37.717
Without them, I'm nothin'.

1087
01:19:48.614 --> 01:19:51.115
Got a load of memories
with this bat, doc.


1088
01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:00.532
Like breakin' your ribs.

1089
01:20:08.525 --> 01:20:10.025
No.

1090
01:20:10.043 --> 01:20:12.083
You listen
and you listen good.


1091
01:20:12.138 --> 01:20:15.455
We're done! You and me,
this is the end of the road.


1092
01:20:15.474 --> 01:20:16.974
Your two options:

1093
01:20:17.125 --> 01:20:20.960
Tell me where my
frickin' wife is,


1094
01:20:21.054 --> 01:20:23.274
And tell your lawyer friend
that you ain't testifying.


1095
01:20:23.298 --> 01:20:24.964
Stop! Move away from her.

1096
01:20:24.984 --> 01:20:25.984
Put your hands up.

1097
01:20:27.044 --> 01:20:28.301
Or what?

1098
01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.444
What are you gonna do?

1099
01:20:30.381 --> 01:20:32.063
Shoot me?

1100
01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:42.575
It's over.

1101
01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:47.580
It's over.

1102
01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:49.841
It's over.

1103
01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.514
- Sign there, and there.
- Okay.


1104
01:20:58.425 --> 01:21:00.311
And you don't need
me to come to court?


1105
01:21:00.335 --> 01:21:02.168
Nope, looks like maggie mcdougal

1106
01:21:02.188 --> 01:21:04.262
Is back in her home
and doing well.


1107
01:21:04.415 --> 01:21:06.334
And arnie hopefully will
be going away to prison


1108
01:21:06.358 --> 01:21:07.933
For a long time.

1109
01:21:08.085 --> 01:21:09.918
- What a relief.
- Yup.


1110
01:21:09.937 --> 01:21:11.511
You did well, my friend.

1111
01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:13.680
It was your actions
that set her free.


1112
01:21:13.699 --> 01:21:15.532
- Thank god.
- Mm-hmm.


1113
01:21:16.777 --> 01:21:19.018
So? Dare I ask.

1114
01:21:19.038 --> 01:21:21.538
What's the update on
our italian lover?


1115
01:21:21.765 --> 01:21:23.856
Come on.

1116
01:21:23.876 --> 01:21:25.578
You lived vicariously through
my love life for years.


1117
01:21:25.602 --> 01:21:27.722
Now it's time for me
to live through yours.


1118
01:21:27.771 --> 01:21:29.416
What do you wanna know?

1119
01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:31.773
All the dirty, sexy details.

1120
01:21:31.792 --> 01:21:33.199
And don't you hold back.

1121
01:21:33.219 --> 01:21:34.943
As a physician,
I'm legally unable


1122
01:21:34.962 --> 01:21:37.128
To disclose that
type of information.


1123
01:21:37.281 --> 01:21:38.722
It's that good, huh?

1124
01:21:39.725 --> 01:21:41.391
You have no idea.

1125
01:22:12.666 --> 01:22:14.716
- Hey.
Hi.


1126
01:22:20.657 --> 01:22:21.932
New project?

1127
01:22:22.159 --> 01:22:24.601
Oh, just a series
I started earlier.


1128
01:22:25.253 --> 01:22:27.162
Is that supposed to be me?

1129
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.180
Us.

1130
01:22:29.108 --> 01:22:31.441
- It's, uh...
- Sexual?


1131
01:22:31.593 --> 01:22:33.685
Risqué is what I
was going to say.


1132
01:22:33.837 --> 01:22:34.837
Mm...

1133
01:22:37.432 --> 01:22:39.524
I haven't started my series yet.

1134
01:22:39.676 --> 01:22:40.933
Your series?

1135
01:22:41.028 --> 01:22:43.120
I just need a subject.

1136
01:22:44.939 --> 01:22:46.197
Mm-hmm.

1137
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:49.251
I need someone to touch...

1138
01:22:50.796 --> 01:22:54.689
To see, to feel,

1139
01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:58.284
In some compromising positions.

1140
01:22:58.304 --> 01:22:59.803
Is this so?
