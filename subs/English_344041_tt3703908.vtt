2
00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:52.397
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:54.644 --> 00:01:55.665
Oh, no, no.

4
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.928
I can't even remember
what got us started, babe.


5
00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:02.612
You're too stubborn, Carter.

6
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.546
Sam, slow down,
watch where you're going.


7
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.137
You said you're gonna
clean up that field.


8
00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:47.781
STANDOFF

9
00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:07.397
And so, we remember Crayton,
for what he had accomplished,


10
00:03:07.422 --> 00:03:11.328
for his family,
a gift that we would treasure


11
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.731
You told Aunt Jane you quit.

12
00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:19.380
Yeah, well. I gave up half of
my day to drive you up here.


13
00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:20.963
So, let's call it
a truce and go wish

14
00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:23.741
you parents happy anniversary, okay, Bird.

15
00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:26.003
Don't call me that.

16
00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:28.512
Okay, Isabelle.

17
00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:32.299
Look, why don't we pay
our respects real quick?


18
00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:35.728
I don't want you to come.

19
00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:40.392
Fine, but leave the camera
here with me, okay?


20
00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:45.253
You know you can't hide
behind that thing forever.


21
00:03:46.808 --> 00:03:51.628
Okay, just don't take
any pictures of the service


22
00:03:51.654 --> 00:03:53.028
Okay.

23
00:03:55.698 --> 00:03:57.312
Here you go.

24
00:03:59.562 --> 00:04:01.368
I'll be right here.

25
00:04:03.758 --> 00:04:06.996
I'm serious about not
taking any pictures, Bird.


26
00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:09.733
Isabelle.

27
00:04:31.543 --> 00:04:32.978
Hi.

28
00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:37.106
I've been taking real
good care of your camera.


29
00:04:41.118 --> 00:04:42.519
I...

30
00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:50.233
And so, we remember Crayton,
for what he had accomplished,


31
00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:16.632
May we leave here

32
00:05:16.658 --> 00:05:21.861
with but one overarching
thought in out minds.


33
00:05:22.173 --> 00:05:25.255
That Crayton will always...

34
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:27.791
Father?

35
00:05:48.324 --> 00:05:50.608
Please.
Please.


36
00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:54.031
Ah!
Okay!


37
00:05:54.057 --> 00:05:56.524
Okay.
Please.


38
00:05:56.548 --> 00:06:00.334
I understand it's...
it is over but...


39
00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:04.190
Please, I'm asking you...
We can talk about this.


40
00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:06.012
We can sit down.
We can make some kind of a deal.


41
00:06:06.038 --> 00:06:07.185
I... Just...
I'm begging you.


42
00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:08.366
I'm begging you to
please just don't....


43
00:06:08.392 --> 00:06:11.255
Shhhh.

44
00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:19.211
Take a good look.

45
00:06:20.685 --> 00:06:22.637
You only get one.

46
00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:26.598
- I don't know you.
- But, you know my employer.


47
00:06:26.622 --> 00:06:29.442
You know you don't challenge
a man in his position.


48
00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:30.608
Plea... Please.

49
00:06:30.634 --> 00:06:32.735
I've shown you my face.

50
00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:35.370
So, you're already dead.

51
00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.103
Don't forget your book.

52
00:07:57.932 --> 00:07:59.711
Roger.

53
00:08:06.983 --> 00:08:08.846
Isabelle!

54
00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.567
Isabelle!

55
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.707
Can I help you?

56
00:08:12.731 --> 00:08:15.986
Yeah, I'm looking for
a little girl in a red dress.


57
00:08:18.704 --> 00:08:21.800
Oh.
There's the little angel right now.


58
00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:24.904
Roger!
No!


59
00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:28.836
Roger!

60
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.976
Help!

61
00:10:10.001 --> 00:10:11.491
Help me!

62
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.093
HELP!

63
00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:16.732
Help me, please!

64
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:18.999
Help me!

65
00:10:19.972 --> 00:10:21.537
Help!

66
00:10:23.763 --> 00:10:25.273
Help!

67
00:10:25.304 --> 00:10:26.529
Hey.

68
00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:28.125
Whoa, whoa whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.


69
00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:30.004
It's okay. It's okay.
I can help you.


70
00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:31.255
What happened?

71
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.923
Tell me what happened?
Somebody hurt?


72
00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:31.423
Oh, fuck.

73
00:11:32.388 --> 00:11:33.748
Fuck.

74
00:11:33.773 --> 00:11:36.049
Hey, you took some potshot, did you?

75
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.771
Pssst!
Get back! Get back!


76
00:12:14.064 --> 00:12:15.827
Give it up, mister!

77
00:12:15.852 --> 00:12:17.918
You ain't getting through to me!

78
00:12:18.862 --> 00:12:21.269
Just making sure you know your place.

79
00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:23.971
MY PLACE?
Where is that, huh?


80
00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:25.543
I'm sitting pretty on a high ground!

81
00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:28.317
You waste your clip burying
bullets in the furniture.


82
00:12:28.341 --> 00:12:31.237
That 45 ain't gonna cut a hole
through to me and you know it.


83
00:12:31.263 --> 00:12:33.211
Not with that fucking
condom it's wearing.


84
00:12:33.235 --> 00:12:35.260
Well, well, well.

85
00:12:36.838 --> 00:12:39.344
That man knows his guns.

86
00:12:45.828 --> 00:12:47.913
So do I.

87
00:12:58.508 --> 00:13:00.217
Ohhh!

88
00:13:09.908 --> 00:13:14.391
Pitiful range you got with that candy ass

89
00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:17.278
You ain't nothing but
a quail hunter, boy.


90
00:13:17.303 --> 00:13:20.404
And I damn sure ain't
no small game, you hear?


91
00:13:21.862 --> 00:13:26.327
You know, it's still enough to tear
you apart this close, asshole.


92
00:13:26.352 --> 00:13:27.965
Eh, you're right.

93
00:13:28.928 --> 00:13:31.200
You know you're going to need
something damn sizable substantial


94
00:13:31.225 --> 00:13:32.523
if you really want to
rough up with me.


95
00:13:32.548 --> 00:13:34.769
I've got plenty, buddy!

96
00:13:34.793 --> 00:13:38.366
You just try and come up 'em
fucking stairs again, okay!


97
00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:41.274
I will blow your
fucking head clean off!


98
00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:44.316
I'm getting the police
on the line, right now!


99
00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:03.496
Phone's dead.

100
00:14:04.898 --> 00:14:07.995
Looks like I caught you
in a bad time.


101
00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:15.179
I got a cell phone, asshole!

102
00:14:20.096 --> 00:14:22.395
I know, dipshit.

103
00:14:24.453 --> 00:14:26.352
I'm looking at it.

104
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.242
Shit!

105
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.880
You really ought to
keep this on you at all times.


106
00:14:32.904 --> 00:14:36.588
You know, for emergency and such.
I'm just saying.


107
00:14:37.106 --> 00:14:38.356
Well, it don't matter anyway.

108
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:40.345
The nearest cop is at least
a half an hour away from here


109
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.679
and I won't need but
a few minutes of your time.


110
00:14:45.227 --> 00:14:47.174
You sound like
you're selling me sometin'.


111
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.626
Maybe I am,
maybe I ain't, friend.


112
00:14:49.652 --> 00:14:52.686
Look.
Here's the situation.


113
00:14:53.495 --> 00:14:56.216
That adorable little Muppet you got
up there, she's seen my face.


114
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.790
Hell, if she was a snake,
she would have bit me.


115
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.442
So, if I don't put a hole in
her head, and I mean like right quick,


116
00:15:02.467 --> 00:15:04.927
somebody is going to do the same
thing to me and I can't allow that.


117
00:15:04.952 --> 00:15:07.496
So, what I need you to do
is send her down,


118
00:15:07.534 --> 00:15:10.331
So I can tidy things up a bit,
you understand?


119
00:15:10.356 --> 00:15:12.617
Yeah.
You think she can identify you.


120
00:15:12.643 --> 00:15:14.184
Ohhh.

121
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.359
Yes, I know she will,
as quick as a frog can lick flies.


122
00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:18.905
But, you, on the other hand

123
00:15:18.931 --> 00:15:20.832
you didn't see fuck all,
except the masked gunman.


124
00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:23.456
I can give less than
two shit about you.


125
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:24.895
All I want is the girl.

126
00:15:24.933 --> 00:15:26.654
So, why don't you
send her on down here,


127
00:15:26.678 --> 00:15:30.008
let me handle my business
and I'll be gone.


128
00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:40.490
Look, son.

129
00:15:40.861 --> 00:15:44.992
I understand the....
unfortunate and the...


130
00:15:45.018 --> 00:15:48.292
complex morale dilemma
that you're facing here.


131
00:15:48.317 --> 00:15:50.760
The wrap is real simple.

132
00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:53.202
The little lady seen my face

133
00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:57.615
Now, she's got to pay the price,
like everybody else.


134
00:15:57.639 --> 00:16:00.676
That's how it works.

135
00:16:02.133 --> 00:16:05.950
As far as you should be concerned,
she's already dead.


136
00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:11.952
Now the sooner you allow me,
to prove that little point to you.


137
00:16:11.977 --> 00:16:14.564
The sooner you can
get back to your...


138
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.846
perfect little life here.

139
00:16:17.549 --> 00:16:20.260
Now, I know you're bleeding up there.

140
00:16:21.327 --> 00:16:25.128
And that does make time a factor,
so, here's what you're going to do.


141
00:16:25.162 --> 00:16:27.831
You're going to send
the girl down to me.


142
00:16:28.735 --> 00:16:30.885
Get yourself to a hospital,
get yourself fixed up.


143
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.845
I'm going to take care of
my business and that will be that.


144
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.530
What do you say?

145
00:16:36.153 --> 00:16:38.059
Believe me when I tell you, son.

146
00:16:38.085 --> 00:16:40.264
You do not want to
fight me on this thing.


147
00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:43.492
This will only devolve
into a battle of wills


148
00:16:43.518 --> 00:16:47.186
and my will is strong than
anyone you have ever met.


149
00:16:51.206 --> 00:16:52.513
Yeah?

150
00:16:53.754 --> 00:16:57.133
Well, you and me ain't never
been introduced, asshole.


151
00:16:57.158 --> 00:17:00.010
My name is Carter Greene.
This is my house!


152
00:17:00.035 --> 00:17:02.456
And so long as I'm still breathing,

153
00:17:04.115 --> 00:17:06.923
you ain't gonna harm a hair
on this child's head.


154
00:17:06.974 --> 00:17:09.567
Listen, you just send the
little lady down here, right now.


155
00:17:09.593 --> 00:17:11.971
This is not the time to play hero

156
00:17:12.013 --> 00:17:15.112
and I am the last individual
on god's green Earth


157
00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:17.204
that you want to butt heads with.
You hear me?


158
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.215
Oh yeah, I heard you.

159
00:17:19.677 --> 00:17:22.691
I hear you and
you sound really scary.


160
00:17:23.977 --> 00:17:26.541
Fuck you, farmer Jim!

161
00:17:26.718 --> 00:17:29.078
You're alone out here on the frontier.

162
00:17:29.104 --> 00:17:33.567
No friends! No family! No cops!
No help at all!


163
00:17:33.592 --> 00:17:35.896
This the wild west, son!

164
00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:38.350
The wild fucking west!

165
00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:41.801
There ain't no guards coming
out here to save your ass!


166
00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:45.583
It's just you and me
and 'em murderer crows


167
00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:48.725
waiting to pick over
our dead bones!


168
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.838
So, you take a breather.

169
00:17:51.742 --> 00:17:54.037
You let that sink in.

170
00:17:54.722 --> 00:17:56.982
But, don't take too long, yeah?

171
00:17:57.818 --> 00:18:01.621
Wouldn't want to get too much blood
all over your white trash finest.


172
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.516
I need your help.

173
00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.276
I want you to go to the bathroom
and get the first aid kit.


174
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.141
It's under the sink, go.

175
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.260
Come to Papa.

176
00:18:29.835 --> 00:18:32.865
Alright, set it down.
Open it up.


177
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.385
Come here.

178
00:18:36.094 --> 00:18:38.202
You're going to help me, okay?

179
00:18:43.461 --> 00:18:44.971
Okay.

180
00:18:52.767 --> 00:18:54.962
Now, get it real hot, okay?

181
00:18:55.125 --> 00:18:57.449
You just hold it on there.

182
00:19:02.272 --> 00:19:04.433
Alright, let's put it down.

183
00:19:04.459 --> 00:19:06.017
Don't look.

184
00:19:17.473 --> 00:19:18.848
More.

185
00:19:20.136 --> 00:19:22.679
Alright, more, more, more.
Come on.


186
00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:23.795
Okay.

187
00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:32.779
You're suppose to swallow them.

188
00:19:36.992 --> 00:19:39.737
Not when it hurts
as bad as I do.


189
00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:43.058
Go
-Go in the other room.

190
00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:46.048
In a box, there are
some light bulbs, okay?


191
00:19:46.073 --> 00:19:48.384
Bring me all of them.

192
00:19:48.408 --> 00:19:52.461
And some... water.
Bring me some water.


193
00:20:03.819 --> 00:20:06.244
I said all of them, go.

194
00:20:14.365 --> 00:20:16.390
Towels, bring me some towels.

195
00:20:16.414 --> 00:20:18.859
The bathroom, go.
Go.


196
00:20:24.234 --> 00:20:25.785
Please.

197
00:20:39.154 --> 00:20:40.422
Good.

198
00:21:12.607 --> 00:21:14.808
Ain't no farmer.

199
00:21:15.008 --> 00:21:16.908
Now, even if we're not here,

200
00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:18.902
we'll hear him if he tries
to climb the upstairs.


201
00:21:18.926 --> 00:21:21.987
Cool.
What's the water for?


202
00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:24.749
For drinking.

203
00:21:26.761 --> 00:21:28.131
Oh.

204
00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:31.386
You want some?

205
00:21:49.544 --> 00:21:51.512
So, what's your name?

206
00:21:51.538 --> 00:21:52.805
Isabelle.

207
00:21:52.829 --> 00:21:55.741
But everyone calls me, Bird,
I don't like it though.


208
00:21:55.767 --> 00:21:57.186
Bird?

209
00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:00.314
How'd you get a
colorful name like that?


210
00:22:00.338 --> 00:22:02.864
My dad gave it to me.

211
00:22:03.077 --> 00:22:05.121
My mom said he started
calling me his little bird


212
00:22:05.145 --> 00:22:08.442
when I was real small because
I never wanted to eat.


213
00:22:09.192 --> 00:22:11.400
He died though.

214
00:22:12.356 --> 00:22:14.461
They both did.

215
00:22:14.852 --> 00:22:17.070
Car crash.

216
00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:22.145
Car.

217
00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:26.459
I'm sorry.

218
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.903
How did you get into
this mess anyway?


219
00:22:32.117 --> 00:22:34.330
He shot Roger at the cemetery.

220
00:22:34.356 --> 00:22:35.461
Roger?

221
00:22:35.489 --> 00:22:37.942
Aunt Jane's boyfriend.

222
00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:42.616
Jesus.
I'm sorry.


223
00:22:44.028 --> 00:22:48.002
You apologize a lot for someone
who didn't do anything wrong.


224
00:22:49.795 --> 00:22:51.406
Uh, no.
I just, you know.


225
00:22:51.432 --> 00:22:54.042
It's too bad your uncle's dead
and...


226
00:22:54.556 --> 00:22:56.737
Wasn't my uncle.

227
00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.156
I should've been nicer to him.

228
00:23:44.612 --> 00:23:47.036
He's a monster.

229
00:23:48.923 --> 00:23:50.374
He's no monster.

230
00:23:50.398 --> 00:23:54.353
Hey.
Don't give him the satisfaction.


231
00:23:54.377 --> 00:23:56.343
He's no monster.

232
00:23:56.619 --> 00:23:58.990
Yes, he is.

233
00:24:02.499 --> 00:24:04.391
You're all alone?

234
00:24:04.429 --> 00:24:07.961
Those big companies moved in and...
this whole valley's a graveyard.


235
00:24:07.987 --> 00:24:12.116
Crops are alive.
Houses are dead.


236
00:24:13.095 --> 00:24:16.825
There's nobody here
but scarecrows.


237
00:24:16.892 --> 00:24:18.796
And you.

238
00:24:19.831 --> 00:24:21.602
And me.

239
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:29.539
How many bullets you have?

240
00:24:29.788 --> 00:24:31.740
Just one.

241
00:24:33.008 --> 00:24:34.336
That's it?

242
00:24:34.361 --> 00:24:37.268
You don't have anymore
packed in a box or something.


243
00:24:37.292 --> 00:24:39.254
I'm afraid not.

244
00:24:39.824 --> 00:24:42.153
Last shell in the house.

245
00:24:42.937 --> 00:24:44.865
Don't worry.

246
00:24:45.132 --> 00:24:46.959
He doesn't know that.

247
00:24:47.824 --> 00:24:50.126
Can we go out the window?

248
00:24:51.402 --> 00:24:53.106
I may not ever make
it with this leg,


249
00:24:53.131 --> 00:24:55.463
you can climb out on your own.

250
00:24:55.557 --> 00:25:00.118
But, I won't be there to protect you,
that's just what he wants.


251
00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.148
Now, we're stuck here until help comes,

252
00:25:03.173 --> 00:25:04.953
he leaves.

253
00:25:07.258 --> 00:25:09.020
Thank you.

254
00:25:10.018 --> 00:25:12.190
No, don't mention it, Isabelle.
Just...


255
00:25:12.214 --> 00:25:14.238
Just doing what's right.

256
00:25:15.573 --> 00:25:17.818
Call me Bird if you want.

257
00:25:18.348 --> 00:25:20.956
I thought you didn't like that name.

258
00:25:22.602 --> 00:25:25.154
Depends on who's using it.

259
00:25:28.196 --> 00:25:30.511
Well, please to meet you, Bird.

260
00:25:30.537 --> 00:25:33.490
I'm Carter, in case you missed it.

261
00:25:44.769 --> 00:25:46.363
That's a nice camera you got there.

262
00:25:46.387 --> 00:25:49.616
What're you... Taking pictures
of the cemetery or something?


263
00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:52.530
Him.

264
00:25:52.556 --> 00:25:54.963
I caught a picture of him
without his mask on.


265
00:25:54.989 --> 00:25:56.480
Does he know that?

266
00:25:56.504 --> 00:25:57.597
I think so.

267
00:25:57.623 --> 00:26:00.114
Oh, that's great.
Give me the film.


268
00:26:06.248 --> 00:26:08.952
Harry, come down!

269
00:26:09.118 --> 00:26:10.941
How's Bernard?

270
00:26:11.501 --> 00:26:13.147
Let me ask you.

271
00:26:16.392 --> 00:26:18.646
What's with all the boxes, huh?

272
00:26:23.084 --> 00:26:25.788
Fixing the jump ship?
Hm?


273
00:26:25.814 --> 00:26:30.338
I bet you wished you schedule
the big move a day earlier, huh?


274
00:26:32.727 --> 00:26:34.445
So, hey, man.

275
00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:37.593
What happened to your family, huh?

276
00:26:37.617 --> 00:26:40.633
What? They up and
leave your sorry ass?


277
00:26:42.277 --> 00:26:45.056
Is this a broken home
I'm sitting in?


278
00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.445
Come on, bad ass, talk to me!
Don't be shy!


279
00:26:49.617 --> 00:26:52.482
Shit, you can confide in me.

280
00:26:54.018 --> 00:26:57.296
Oh, whoa!
Look at here.


281
00:26:57.657 --> 00:26:59.650
Soldier boy.

282
00:26:59.674 --> 00:27:01.496
You, a soldier boy.

283
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.579
Damn good one, from the
looks of this photograph.


284
00:27:04.605 --> 00:27:06.374
Look at you,
all spit and polish


285
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.414
with your shiny medals
and your pretty ribbon.


286
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.421
Hey, where were you?

287
00:27:11.717 --> 00:27:13.997
Huh? Hey, look.
I'm ex-military too, man.


288
00:27:14.021 --> 00:27:17.170
Black ops, you know, real jackal shit.
Where were you?


289
00:27:17.327 --> 00:27:20.092
Iraq?
No, no, no.


290
00:27:20.116 --> 00:27:22.095
Afghanistan.

291
00:27:22.119 --> 00:27:24.491
Hey, sergeant Greene.
Hey, sergeant Greene.


292
00:27:24.517 --> 00:27:27.977
As one ex-military man to another;

293
00:27:28.527 --> 00:27:32.762
I salute you and
thank you for your service.


294
00:27:35.135 --> 00:27:36.483
Damn.

295
00:27:37.187 --> 00:27:39.609
Nice looking woman
you had there, boy.


296
00:27:40.355 --> 00:27:42.298
Real nice looking.

297
00:27:42.323 --> 00:27:45.010
Hey, you don't mind if I get her
number when this is all over, do you?


298
00:27:45.035 --> 00:27:46.750
- Just shut up!
- Heyyy.


299
00:27:46.775 --> 00:27:49.664
SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!

300
00:27:50.186 --> 00:27:52.605
Oh, come on, sergeant Greene.

301
00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:55.124
I'm just fucking with you
a little bit.


302
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.614
Ain't no need for you to get
all furiously articulate on me.


303
00:28:04.273 --> 00:28:05.977
Hey...

304
00:28:06.412 --> 00:28:08.240
Just want to thank you.

305
00:28:08.811 --> 00:28:12.164
Took the liberty of...
dipping into you little reserve.


306
00:28:12.542 --> 00:28:13.794
I've been feeling nice and warm,

307
00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:16.366
I hope you got something up there
to keep you chill oloy too.


308
00:28:16.392 --> 00:28:18.465
Oh, and...

309
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:22.526
All bullshit aside.
Just between you and me.


310
00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:25.325
I understand where you're
coming from with all this, man.


311
00:28:25.349 --> 00:28:27.058
I understand,
I got a little girl myself.


312
00:28:27.083 --> 00:28:28.262
She ain't but...

313
00:28:28.288 --> 00:28:32.636
Well, she can't be no older than...
the lady up there and...


314
00:28:32.662 --> 00:28:34.864
She means the world to me.

315
00:28:35.294 --> 00:28:36.128
Uh.

316
00:28:36.154 --> 00:28:37.431
Nothing I wouldn't do
for that little girl.


317
00:28:37.455 --> 00:28:39.020
I mean, that's why
I'm in this line of work.


318
00:28:39.046 --> 00:28:40.931
You know, I got a family
that depends on me


319
00:28:40.955 --> 00:28:42.691
and I can't let one
little loose end


320
00:28:42.715 --> 00:28:45.394
with a pony tail take them
away from me, can I?


321
00:28:45.419 --> 00:28:48.010
I mean, you can't let her
get in the way


322
00:28:48.035 --> 00:28:51.047
of you taking care of your
responsibilities either.


323
00:28:51.071 --> 00:28:52.832
Right?
I mean...


324
00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:56.183
What's more important?
The life of a stranger or...


325
00:28:56.209 --> 00:28:59.336
or the future of your family.
You feel me?


326
00:28:59.927 --> 00:29:01.552
- Take this.
- Man, am I right?


327
00:29:01.577 --> 00:29:03.347
Put it at the back
of the toilet.


328
00:29:03.373 --> 00:29:04.590
In the toilet?

329
00:29:04.615 --> 00:29:06.683
- In the-In the tank.
- Oh.


330
00:29:06.708 --> 00:29:08.188
- Put it in the tank.
- Okay.


331
00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:13.577
Hey.
Let me ask you this.


332
00:29:13.603 --> 00:29:15.816
You want to see
your son again, right?


333
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.578
I mean, am I right?

334
00:29:17.693 --> 00:29:20.018
Well, you ain't wrong wrong , mister.

335
00:29:20.857 --> 00:29:24.270
Whatcha think I got to lose, man,
I aint' lost?


336
00:29:25.007 --> 00:29:28.320
The kid stays with me.
All right?


337
00:29:28.346 --> 00:29:31.330
Why don't you just go home
to your own daughter, huh?


338
00:29:31.606 --> 00:29:33.619
No can do, partner.

339
00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.067
No can do.

340
00:29:38.491 --> 00:29:41.382
Once I sink my teeth into something
I don't pull them out,


341
00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:43.386
until the thing is dead.

342
00:29:43.497 --> 00:29:45.356
Yeah, you sure about that, pal?

343
00:29:45.381 --> 00:29:47.558
Now, I wouldn't bet on you
lasting too long


344
00:29:47.583 --> 00:29:49.304
with that buckshot in your gut.

345
00:29:49.328 --> 00:29:52.557
Oh, shit, man. By my standard,
this ain't nothing but a flash wound.


346
00:29:52.582 --> 00:29:55.859
Well, my's a flash wound
by anybody's standards, so...


347
00:29:55.885 --> 00:29:57.842
We'll just see who drops first.

348
00:29:57.866 --> 00:29:59.958
Well, I got a feeling that
that's gonna be you


349
00:29:59.982 --> 00:30:02.754
once I burn this mother fucker
to the ground.


350
00:30:02.779 --> 00:30:04.498
What you got to say to that?

351
00:30:04.522 --> 00:30:06.837
I'm way ahead of you, asshole.

352
00:30:07.127 --> 00:30:09.817
Now, you know,
just as well as I do,


353
00:30:09.842 --> 00:30:11.980
the kid's got a picture of you
without your mask on.


354
00:30:12.004 --> 00:30:13.820
You see, I got you, man.

355
00:30:13.846 --> 00:30:15.510
Film's in a safe place.

356
00:30:15.536 --> 00:30:18.673
it's in a Ziploc bag
under the fucking water.


357
00:30:18.698 --> 00:30:21.444
You know damn well there's a
decent chance that film will survive


358
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.296
the fire for the cops to find.

359
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.431
I got to think, man.

360
00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:26.916
That's well past the
level of acceptable risk!


361
00:30:26.942 --> 00:30:29.746
For such a tiny professional as yourself!

362
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.489
You know your sneering condescending act
really sucks right about now, soldier boy.


363
00:30:33.513 --> 00:30:35.698
You should've stuck to
that pure hearted yoco bit.


364
00:30:35.722 --> 00:30:37.765
That shit was working for you.

365
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:39.905
Whatever you say, chief.

366
00:30:39.931 --> 00:30:43.422
Oh, I want to break you into
a million pieces, mother fucker.


367
00:30:43.446 --> 00:30:46.136
A million tiny fucking pieces.

368
00:30:46.162 --> 00:30:49.433
You want to play with me?
Alright, then.


369
00:30:50.498 --> 00:30:53.051
It's feeling to get ugly
after this bitch.


370
00:30:56.758 --> 00:30:59.211
All quiet on the western front, kid?

371
00:30:59.236 --> 00:31:02.090
That's right.
Same as yesterday.


372
00:31:02.115 --> 00:31:04.993
Same as every yesterday.

373
00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:08.295
I tell you. I don't know how this place keeps
self together between my rounds.


374
00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:12.025
Baker, it's either gets and like it.
Just swallow and smile, kid.


375
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:13.900
Ed, I got a question for you.

376
00:31:13.924 --> 00:31:16.586
When you old dogs're going
to stop calling me kid?


377
00:31:16.612 --> 00:31:18.494
Till you earn your wings.

378
00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:22.125
Don't take offense.
That's just how it is around these parts.


379
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.167
And how do I earn my wings?

380
00:31:25.192 --> 00:31:29.185
Well, you can start by getting
your ass over to Clem Sagers' place


381
00:31:29.211 --> 00:31:31.991
Them teenagers been
messing around on his land.


382
00:31:32.017 --> 00:31:33.725
Again?

383
00:31:37.173 --> 00:31:38.923
You see something, kid?

384
00:31:41.027 --> 00:31:44.209
It's probably nothing,
I'll-I'll get back to you.


385
00:32:40.423 --> 00:32:41.564
(Carter.)

386
00:32:41.588 --> 00:32:44.767
(Where's Sam?
Where's Sam, Carter?)


387
00:32:55.711 --> 00:32:57.222
Bird.

388
00:33:00.339 --> 00:33:02.433
Bird, I need a drink.

389
00:33:03.236 --> 00:33:05.179
More water?

390
00:33:05.395 --> 00:33:06.702
No.

391
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.561
There's some other bottles
up in the attic.


392
00:33:12.212 --> 00:33:15.525
Aunt Jane gets angry
when she drinks.


393
00:33:16.595 --> 00:33:19.431
Yeah. Well,
I get angry when I don't drink.


394
00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:21.971
Hey.
Listen.


395
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:24.106
Go get me a bottle.

396
00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.924
Where did you get that?

397
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:15.160
I'm sorry, I'll put it back.

398
00:34:15.185 --> 00:34:16.953
Where did you get that?
Put it back.


399
00:34:18.093 --> 00:34:19.964
Put it back now.

400
00:35:09.676 --> 00:35:11.109
Mara.

401
00:35:13.013 --> 00:35:15.424
I could never say this,

402
00:35:15.448 --> 00:35:18.171
to you face to face.

403
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.010
Even though you told me
over and over again that


404
00:35:22.035 --> 00:35:24.448
it wasn't my fault.

405
00:35:24.557 --> 00:35:26.857
Your eyes never hid the truth.

406
00:35:26.881 --> 00:35:29.069
I killed our son.

407
00:35:29.687 --> 00:35:31.781
I let him die.

408
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:50.852
I want you know that you did
the right thing leaving me.


409
00:35:50.877 --> 00:35:53.696
You mother fucker.

410
00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.475
I hope one day you find it
in your heart to forgive me.


411
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.890
I'm so sorry I was so weak,

412
00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:06.629
Carter.

413
00:36:18.892 --> 00:36:21.368
God damn, sergeant Greene.

414
00:36:21.392 --> 00:36:23.511
That sure is a whole
lot of apologies.


415
00:36:23.535 --> 00:36:27.071
Exactly how many kids
did you get killed?


416
00:36:33.685 --> 00:36:35.716
Don't look at me.

417
00:36:36.515 --> 00:36:38.366
Don't look at me!

418
00:36:39.834 --> 00:36:43.330
Well. Now I know why you
had that cannon so handy.


419
00:36:43.615 --> 00:36:45.781
You packed the place up,

420
00:36:46.866 --> 00:36:50.327
got drunk, then you stopped
and thought about it.


421
00:36:50.352 --> 00:36:51.383
Decided that,

422
00:36:51.408 --> 00:36:53.886
life wasn't worth living anymore, was it?

423
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:55.399
What the hell.

424
00:36:57.694 --> 00:37:01.491
Don't let this little fiasco with
the kid ruin you whole afternoon.


425
00:37:01.517 --> 00:37:02.959
By all means, go ahead,

426
00:37:02.984 --> 00:37:04.635
act like the two of us
ain't even here


427
00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.484
and blow your god damn brains out!

428
00:37:12.412 --> 00:37:14.249
Woo hoo hoo.

429
00:37:14.937 --> 00:37:18.229
But, no, seriously, man.
I know where you're coming from though.


430
00:37:18.254 --> 00:37:19.702
I do.

431
00:37:21.174 --> 00:37:23.182
Shit, she ain't your kid.

432
00:37:24.644 --> 00:37:28.187
Can't turn back time.
Believe me, I've tried.


433
00:37:28.845 --> 00:37:31.448
But, you know I'm
going to win this thing.


434
00:37:31.877 --> 00:37:34.714
Even tombstone courage runs out.

435
00:37:36.006 --> 00:37:39.249
You need to go head on
and give in to the beast.


436
00:37:40.604 --> 00:37:43.162
Send the little lady
down here to me.


437
00:37:47.656 --> 00:37:49.394
Come and get her.

438
00:38:04.272 --> 00:38:05.912
Hello!

439
00:38:16.881 --> 00:38:18.491
Hey!

440
00:38:18.517 --> 00:38:21.386
You guys wanna order some pizza?

441
00:38:27.346 --> 00:38:29.432
I'm sorry.

442
00:38:30.908 --> 00:38:33.310
No, don't be sorry.
I...


443
00:38:33.948 --> 00:38:36.064
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

444
00:38:46.111 --> 00:38:48.546
What was your son's name?

445
00:38:51.254 --> 00:38:52.830
Sam.

446
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.609
You missed him?

447
00:38:58.107 --> 00:38:59.602
Everyday.

448
00:38:59.627 --> 00:39:02.232
I missed my parents too.

449
00:39:05.624 --> 00:39:08.231
There ain't no quitting me.

450
00:39:08.406 --> 00:39:09.794
What?

451
00:39:10.794 --> 00:39:14.975
"There ain't no quitting me."
Just something my dad used to say.


452
00:39:17.564 --> 00:39:20.218
It always made me feel safe.

453
00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:26.479
You think I'll see him
when I die?


454
00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:29.749
Hey, don't talk like that, okay?

455
00:39:30.062 --> 00:39:32.191
Help will be here soon.

456
00:39:32.216 --> 00:39:35.372
Don't say that, Carter,
I'm not stupid.


457
00:39:37.982 --> 00:39:39.395
Alright.

458
00:39:40.415 --> 00:39:42.370
Maybe help ain't coming.

459
00:39:45.577 --> 00:39:48.002
But, I can promise you this.

460
00:39:50.386 --> 00:39:52.703
I won't let him get you.

461
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.209
You hear me?

462
00:39:56.113 --> 00:39:59.209
I won't let him get you.

463
00:40:02.187 --> 00:40:04.046
You believe me?

464
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:10.283
Why did your wife leave?

465
00:40:13.357 --> 00:40:14.821
Me.

466
00:40:15.703 --> 00:40:17.379
This place.

467
00:40:19.778 --> 00:40:24.053
Reminded...
her of him.


468
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.763
I just wish...

469
00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.827
just...

470
00:40:35.586 --> 00:40:36.942
wish...

471
00:40:43.292 --> 00:40:45.383
I believe you.

472
00:40:53.408 --> 00:40:56.194
Just keeping you on your toes, buddy.

473
00:40:56.837 --> 00:40:58.606
Here, have another one.

474
00:41:11.939 --> 00:41:14.080
How you all doing up there?

475
00:41:14.153 --> 00:41:17.569
I could ask you the same question,
you little sack of shit.


476
00:41:17.595 --> 00:41:20.533
You know you sound
like a sick animal.


477
00:41:20.558 --> 00:41:23.792
Just hunting around
for a corner to die in.


478
00:41:23.816 --> 00:41:27.428
You feeling kind of cold?
Kind of weak?


479
00:41:27.453 --> 00:41:31.741
Yeah.
You're going into shock, pal.


480
00:41:32.087 --> 00:41:34.640
You're gonna die,
soon.


481
00:41:34.665 --> 00:41:37.129
Unless you get to a hospital.

482
00:41:37.767 --> 00:41:40.312
Fuck you, I'm fine!

483
00:41:40.535 --> 00:41:44.654
I ain't going no where till that little
bitch's pushing up daisies, period!


484
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.883
That suits me just fine, mister.

485
00:41:48.029 --> 00:41:50.432
Nothing bleeds forever.

486
00:41:50.727 --> 00:41:52.741
Another few hours,

487
00:41:52.895 --> 00:41:56.816
you be lying face down in
a puddle of your own fluids.


488
00:41:56.841 --> 00:41:58.807
Hey, you don't worry though!

489
00:41:58.832 --> 00:42:03.457
I'll let your daughter know you died
defending the future of your family.


490
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.488
Oh, outstanding, sergeant Greene,
out-fucking-standing!


491
00:42:07.513 --> 00:42:09.446
You beat me at my own game!

492
00:42:09.471 --> 00:42:13.160
You're master of psychological warfare!

493
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:15.910
Next thing you know, you'll
have me tidying up the place


494
00:42:15.935 --> 00:42:18.906
and giving you a blow job
on the way out!


495
00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.589
Brilliant!

496
00:42:22.435 --> 00:42:24.397
- Sorry.
- What're you doing?


497
00:42:24.423 --> 00:42:26.732
No film in that camera.

498
00:42:28.676 --> 00:42:32.700
Yeah, it just makes me feel safe.
Stupid, I know.


499
00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.149
We all got our ways
in dealing with stuff.


500
00:42:47.263 --> 00:42:49.511
What?
What is it?


501
00:42:49.741 --> 00:42:51.316
Shit.

502
00:42:51.957 --> 00:42:53.935
Just reminds me.

503
00:42:53.961 --> 00:42:55.785
We got a problem.

504
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:58.073
How big?

505
00:42:58.207 --> 00:42:59.915
It's big.

506
00:43:00.792 --> 00:43:03.662
There's a generator in the basement
that runs the whole power, you see.


507
00:43:03.696 --> 00:43:05.921
I haven't filled it up in days.

508
00:43:07.269 --> 00:43:09.442
It's running on the fumes.

509
00:43:09.473 --> 00:43:11.488
I don't understand?

510
00:43:11.513 --> 00:43:13.122
It would be night soon, Bird.

511
00:43:13.147 --> 00:43:16.265
Without any power, the whole house
would be pitch black.


512
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:19.285
There's no way I can keep him
from trying something in the dark.


513
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.214
Not with one shot.

514
00:43:21.555 --> 00:43:23.803
What does that mean?

515
00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.917
It means I got to
get you out of here.


516
00:43:27.942 --> 00:43:30.131
While it's still light up.

517
00:43:31.057 --> 00:43:33.106
But your leg.

518
00:43:33.979 --> 00:43:35.769
I'm not going with you.

519
00:43:35.794 --> 00:43:38.283
I'm gonna help you climb out
a window so you can run for help.


520
00:43:38.308 --> 00:43:39.955
But you said that's what he wants.

521
00:43:39.979 --> 00:43:42.151
I know what I said, Bird,
but things are different now, okay?


522
00:43:42.176 --> 00:43:44.433
You got to trust me on this.

523
00:43:44.595 --> 00:43:46.827
This is your best chance.

524
00:43:47.763 --> 00:43:49.287
Okay.

525
00:43:58.446 --> 00:44:00.499
Oh, fuck.

526
00:44:08.011 --> 00:44:12.330
Hey. Is the... shooting range in
Red Pepper open for the fall yet?


527
00:44:13.508 --> 00:44:14.841
What's that, kid?

528
00:44:14.866 --> 00:44:18.752
The shooting range on Red Pepper,
is it open now?


529
00:44:18.776 --> 00:44:20.807
No.
Why?


530
00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:23.051
I'm not sure.
I'm...


531
00:44:23.075 --> 00:44:25.808
I'm at the cemetery and
I heard...


532
00:44:27.778 --> 00:44:30.388
What's that?
What did you hear, kid?


533
00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:33.337
Kid?

534
00:44:34.528 --> 00:44:35.883
Nothing.

535
00:44:36.546 --> 00:44:38.890
I'm looking into something,
I'll get back to you.


536
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.120
And stop calling me kid.

537
00:44:59.037 --> 00:45:00.734
Alright, let's go.

538
00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.131
What if he realizes you aren't
guarding the stairs anymore.


539
00:45:03.154 --> 00:45:05.488
He hit the broken glass,
we'll hear him, come on.


540
00:45:05.513 --> 00:45:07.575
Now, I want you to climb down
on this roof, right?


541
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.620
There's a crate, jump down
on it and run like hell.


542
00:45:10.645 --> 00:45:12.758
Alright?
Hey, hey.


543
00:45:12.783 --> 00:45:15.361
Even if he hears you, you'll be
a little speck on the horizon


544
00:45:15.386 --> 00:45:16.636
by the time he gets outside.

545
00:45:16.662 --> 00:45:18.033
I don't want to do this.

546
00:45:18.058 --> 00:45:20.260
Neither do I, Bird,
but we have to.


547
00:45:20.285 --> 00:45:22.158
We don't have a choice.

548
00:45:44.394 --> 00:45:46.611
- Come on, give me the camera.
- No.


549
00:45:46.832 --> 00:45:48.377
Come on.
I'll take good care of it.


550
00:45:48.403 --> 00:45:49.863
Don't you trust me?

551
00:45:49.888 --> 00:45:51.223
Come on.

552
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.667
Bird.
I...


553
00:45:55.368 --> 00:45:57.984
Okay, keep the camera.
Come on, go.


554
00:45:59.506 --> 00:46:00.785
That's it.

555
00:46:01.522 --> 00:46:02.984
Stay low.

556
00:46:05.316 --> 00:46:07.803
Okay, go.
Go on.


557
00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:11.794
That's it.
You got it.


558
00:46:56.196 --> 00:46:58.196
Afternoon, officer.

559
00:47:01.176 --> 00:47:02.979
What the fuck?

560
00:47:04.359 --> 00:47:05.939
Shit.

561
00:47:16.953 --> 00:47:18.412
Shit!

562
00:47:58.975 --> 00:48:00.544
Carter.

563
00:48:01.057 --> 00:48:02.403
What?

564
00:48:02.428 --> 00:48:05.403
He hid the police car in the hanger.

565
00:48:11.015 --> 00:48:13.153
What?
Where is he now?


566
00:48:15.484 --> 00:48:19.187
He's far. He's walking
back around the front.


567
00:48:26.723 --> 00:48:27.955
Freeze!

568
00:48:27.979 --> 00:48:30.218
Put your fucking
hands up in the air.


569
00:48:30.243 --> 00:48:31.493
Hands up.

570
00:48:31.517 --> 00:48:34.874
That's right.
It's over.


571
00:48:34.899 --> 00:48:36.973
It's time for you to leave.

572
00:48:36.997 --> 00:48:39.327
I ain't got my glasses on
but that looks that same


573
00:48:39.352 --> 00:48:42.560
candy ass 20 gauge you been
counting on this whole time.


574
00:48:42.584 --> 00:48:45.491
Heavy on power.
Shit for range.


575
00:48:46.008 --> 00:48:48.250
That's all you got, ain't it?

576
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.082
You got, until the count of five,

577
00:48:52.372 --> 00:48:55.700
to turn around and get
the FUCK off my property!


578
00:48:55.725 --> 00:48:56.930
You got to be kidding me.

579
00:48:56.955 --> 00:49:00.069
You probably couldn't even nick me
with that potty trainer from up there.


580
00:49:00.095 --> 00:49:02.602
Let alone make a kill shot, hell.

581
00:49:02.627 --> 00:49:04.906
How many bullets you got left, Jethro?

582
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.763
I got plenty!
Alright!


583
00:49:07.787 --> 00:49:11.401
Don't you worry about it. I got
six reloads waiting on your ass!


584
00:49:11.426 --> 00:49:15.100
Good. God damn!
Six reloads!


585
00:49:15.124 --> 00:49:17.497
You practically swimming
in ammunitions up there.


586
00:49:17.522 --> 00:49:19.604
Well, why no go ahead
and try you luck.


587
00:49:19.629 --> 00:49:22.020
You might sink a pellet in
my eye, take me down.


588
00:49:22.044 --> 00:49:24.872
Come on, what's you waiting on?
Fire away!


589
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.202
I'm not going to kill you
if I don't have to.


590
00:49:27.227 --> 00:49:28.575
When I first go to this dump

591
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.794
you spit fire at me
just to say howdy-do.


592
00:49:30.819 --> 00:49:34.274
Now you want to play trigger shy,
I don't buy that for a minute.


593
00:49:34.299 --> 00:49:38.821
Are you riding on just
one shell up there, partner?


594
00:49:38.962 --> 00:49:40.808
You are, aren't you?

595
00:49:41.118 --> 00:49:44.553
And if you take a shot
at this range and MISS,


596
00:49:44.578 --> 00:49:45.618
it's over.

597
00:49:45.642 --> 00:49:48.214
I don't think you could
afford to take that risk.


598
00:49:48.238 --> 00:49:50.334
Let's ask the little lady.

599
00:49:52.444 --> 00:49:53.727
5.

600
00:49:53.752 --> 00:49:54.966
I ain't going no where.

601
00:49:54.991 --> 00:49:57.178
You might as well save
your breath go on and shoot.


602
00:49:57.203 --> 00:49:58.113
4.

603
00:49:58.145 --> 00:50:00.604
Look, I'm betting if I pull my pistol out
I can shoot you there.


604
00:50:00.629 --> 00:50:01.589
3!

605
00:50:01.615 --> 00:50:04.314
I suggest you ought to shoot me
or get your ass back inside.


606
00:50:04.339 --> 00:50:05.488
2!

607
00:50:05.513 --> 00:50:06.386
One!

608
00:50:06.412 --> 00:50:07.549
Shit!

609
00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:12.138
I ain't calling you a liar, sergeant Greene.

610
00:50:12.163 --> 00:50:14.752
But you got to the most
merciful man I've ever met.


611
00:50:14.776 --> 00:50:16.394
Hey, little lady.

612
00:50:18.243 --> 00:50:20.381
I just want to shoot you.

613
00:50:20.406 --> 00:50:23.013
Yeah, you made the right call, soldier boy.

614
00:50:23.037 --> 00:50:24.345
Yes, indeed.

615
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:27.662
Who are you to gamble
with that little girl's life.


616
00:50:28.182 --> 00:50:31.241
Let's see if you'll gamble
with somebody else's.


617
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.950
Roll call!

618
00:50:37.981 --> 00:50:39.482
As you is.

619
00:50:39.506 --> 00:50:41.327
Come on.

620
00:50:41.352 --> 00:50:42.827
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

621
00:50:42.852 --> 00:50:44.663
You sick son of a bitch.

622
00:50:44.689 --> 00:50:47.740
Don't you disappoint me, hillbilly.

623
00:50:47.765 --> 00:50:49.843
I said, speak up!

624
00:50:50.064 --> 00:50:52.424
So the man upstairs can hear you.

625
00:50:54.113 --> 00:50:56.156
My name is officer Jerry Baker.

626
00:50:56.182 --> 00:51:00.102
Jerry Baker!
Ha ha ha ha...


627
00:51:00.133 --> 00:51:01.607
Come on,
tell us about the...


628
00:51:01.645 --> 00:51:04.153
about the wife, kids
two car garage.


629
00:51:04.178 --> 00:51:06.263
I have-have a wife
and a son.


630
00:51:06.294 --> 00:51:09.212
Names, damn it!
Give the man names!


631
00:51:09.274 --> 00:51:11.897
My wife's name is Linda.
My son's name...


632
00:51:11.921 --> 00:51:13.649
Alright!
Cut it out!


633
00:51:13.674 --> 00:51:15.667
It ain't going to work.

634
00:51:15.982 --> 00:51:17.886
Just save yourself the effort!

635
00:51:17.912 --> 00:51:19.874
You need to think about it,
sergeant Greene.


636
00:51:19.899 --> 00:51:21.698
You need to think about it real hard.

637
00:51:21.723 --> 00:51:24.312
Get your mind right, you see.

638
00:51:24.337 --> 00:51:28.011
Jerry here, ain't seen my face
just like you, which means...


639
00:51:28.037 --> 00:51:30.091
Technically, he's off the hook.

640
00:51:30.116 --> 00:51:32.225
Also, he's not hurt too bad.

641
00:51:32.249 --> 00:51:34.825
Which means you can probably
get him to the hospital.


642
00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.564
But, you're going to have to do it
right quick, I mean like, pronto.


643
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:40.584
You don't have the leverage
that you think you do, asshole.


644
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:43.366
Fuck leverage!
Do the math, dipshit!


645
00:51:43.392 --> 00:51:45.477
You send the little lady
down to me right now,


646
00:51:45.502 --> 00:51:48.613
You're saving 2 lives
in exchange for 1.


647
00:51:48.651 --> 00:51:51.493
Not to toot my own horn, but,
that's a hell of a bargain.


648
00:51:51.517 --> 00:51:53.466
Fuck you!

649
00:51:53.491 --> 00:51:54.408
Okay!

650
00:51:54.432 --> 00:51:57.182
You heard him, Jerry.
Have it your way.


651
00:52:00.569 --> 00:52:02.834
Oh, quit your whining.

652
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:05.502
Hold on. Hold on.
I got something here for you.


653
00:52:05.526 --> 00:52:06.716
Here we go.

654
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:08.350
- No, no, no.
- Alright.


655
00:52:08.374 --> 00:52:09.522
No.

656
00:52:09.548 --> 00:52:11.799
That's it.
Oh, yeah. That's it.


657
00:52:11.825 --> 00:52:13.973
- Alright?
- What're you doing?


658
00:52:13.999 --> 00:52:15.894
Stand back now.

659
00:52:27.334 --> 00:52:28.865
Oh, god!

660
00:52:32.921 --> 00:52:35.212
What's he doing?

661
00:52:35.615 --> 00:52:38.238
Get out of here.
Go, go upstairs.


662
00:52:38.263 --> 00:52:40.953
Get upstairs, now!
Go.


663
00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:43.180
Don't listen.

664
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.171
Four down,
four to go!


665
00:52:48.196 --> 00:52:50.551
- Your thumbs getting past.
- Oh, you shit fuck.


666
00:52:50.575 --> 00:52:53.486
Listen up, soldier boy!
What's it gonna be?


667
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:56.406
Me and Jerry Baker waiting
for you to send her ass down.


668
00:52:56.432 --> 00:52:58.185
You piece of shit.

669
00:52:58.211 --> 00:53:00.991
You're a piece of fucking shit,
you know that?


670
00:53:01.015 --> 00:53:03.104
Sticks and stones, my friend.

671
00:53:04.198 --> 00:53:07.077
Alright, have it your way.

672
00:53:08.279 --> 00:53:09.923
- Please.
- Stay with me now.


673
00:53:09.948 --> 00:53:11.212
Just you and me.

674
00:53:11.236 --> 00:53:13.100
Please, stop.

675
00:53:35.924 --> 00:53:39.116
I was going to start
with the toes, but...


676
00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.033
I guess I lost the stomach
for the hard stuff.


677
00:53:44.314 --> 00:53:47.292
Hey!
Listen, partner.


678
00:53:47.316 --> 00:53:49.383
It's decision time.

679
00:53:49.633 --> 00:53:51.513
Please, don't.

680
00:53:53.218 --> 00:53:55.252
Please.

681
00:53:55.857 --> 00:53:57.663
Listen, man!

682
00:53:57.801 --> 00:54:00.977
If you don't send that
little girl down here,


683
00:54:01.002 --> 00:54:04.564
with that film,
and I mean right now!


684
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:08.095
I'm fixing the Jackson Pollock,
Jerry Baker's brains


685
00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:11.653
all over the mother fucking floor.

686
00:54:11.678 --> 00:54:15.392
Man. You kill that guy
is because you want to!


687
00:54:15.417 --> 00:54:17.381
You're just looking for an excuse!

688
00:54:17.406 --> 00:54:20.792
You want to kill somebody!
You go ahead!


689
00:54:20.816 --> 00:54:22.843
You got fucking brain damage!

690
00:54:22.868 --> 00:54:25.790
You're a sick fuck!
And you want to!


691
00:54:25.816 --> 00:54:27.551
Not because...

692
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.240
A simple yes or no
would have worked.


693
00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:55.412
But, you know.

694
00:54:55.531 --> 00:54:57.535
You really piss me off, Jethro.

695
00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:01.375
A matter of fact, you've lost
all your conversation privileges.


696
00:55:01.401 --> 00:55:05.240
Yeah!
Radio silence, starts right now!


697
00:55:05.265 --> 00:55:09.098
And it ends, when you're ready
to send that little girl down!


698
00:55:09.122 --> 00:55:11.613
Now, that suits me just fine, asshole.

699
00:55:11.638 --> 00:55:14.676
I'm sick of hearing your
god damn voice anyway.


700
00:55:17.316 --> 00:55:18.997
Just do me a favour
when you dropped dead


701
00:55:19.022 --> 00:55:20.484
just do it real loud, okay?

702
00:55:20.508 --> 00:55:22.928
So, I can hear it from up here.

703
00:55:58.803 --> 00:56:01.763
I don't hear him walking around anymore.

704
00:56:04.982 --> 00:56:06.950
What's he doing?

705
00:56:17.075 --> 00:56:18.959
Let's find out.

706
00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.796
Alright, cock sucker.

707
00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.633
Alright, you win.
I got to...


708
00:56:28.444 --> 00:56:31.198
I got to get to a hospital, man.

709
00:56:31.223 --> 00:56:32.801
You
-You can have her.

710
00:56:32.825 --> 00:56:35.125
You can have the girl, okay?

711
00:56:38.412 --> 00:56:41.283
You hear me?
You win.


712
00:56:41.754 --> 00:56:44.801
I'm sending her down, alright?
Just...


713
00:56:44.988 --> 00:56:48.415
Just get the fuck out of here
when I do, okay?


714
00:56:57.421 --> 00:56:59.395
He ain't down there.

715
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:03.399
He must have gone outside again.

716
00:57:03.424 --> 00:57:05.546
I'm gonna sneak down there
want for him to come back in


717
00:57:05.571 --> 00:57:07.010
and blow him in half.

718
00:57:07.035 --> 00:57:08.765
- It's a trick.
- No, no.


719
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:10.144
I just offered you up
like he won


720
00:57:10.169 --> 00:57:12.828
so that he drops anything
else he got cooking.


721
00:57:12.852 --> 00:57:15.906
He ain't talking back because
he ain't down there.


722
00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:18.481
No, he's waiting for you.

723
00:57:18.999 --> 00:57:21.631
Get in the bathroom,
lock the door.


724
00:57:22.044 --> 00:57:23.548
Carter, don't go.

725
00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:26.821
No time to argue. You get in there.
Go, now!


726
00:57:26.846 --> 00:57:28.526
Don't come out.

727
00:59:21.029 --> 00:59:22.486
Bird.

728
00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:47.296
Carter, are you back?

729
00:59:47.321 --> 00:59:49.745
Hey, now, little lady,
come on out.


730
00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:51.129
Shit!

731
00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.160
Whoa!

732
00:59:59.163 --> 01:00:00.196
FUCK!

733
01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:01.618
Fuck.

734
01:00:03.321 --> 01:00:06.511
Damn, that kind of hurt!

735
01:00:06.535 --> 01:00:07.935
Ahh!

736
01:00:07.961 --> 01:00:10.336
This really ain't your day, pal.

737
01:00:10.361 --> 01:00:11.807
Hey, you want to think about

738
01:00:11.832 --> 01:00:14.388
packing it in,
heading to the hospital, huh?


739
01:00:14.412 --> 01:00:16.631
Or somebody gets hurt.

740
01:00:16.906 --> 01:00:18.321
Man.

741
01:00:22.263 --> 01:00:24.881
Think it ain't looking
too good for you, buddy!


742
01:00:24.906 --> 01:00:27.377
This is a lousy place
for the end of the road.


743
01:00:27.401 --> 01:00:29.412
You think this shit is funny, huh?

744
01:00:30.591 --> 01:00:32.462
Okay, hillbilly.

745
01:00:33.571 --> 01:00:35.022
Alright.

746
01:00:40.656 --> 01:00:43.283
I'll show you how funny
this shit is.


747
01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.194
That ain't nothing.

748
01:01:05.857 --> 01:01:07.379
Fuck the film.

749
01:01:07.403 --> 01:01:09.549
I'll take my chances.

750
01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:25.162
What're you doing?

751
01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.591
Wouldn't you like to know?

752
01:02:25.276 --> 01:02:27.187
Yeah, that's good, man.

753
01:02:28.229 --> 01:02:31.312
Keep moving around,
keep that blood pumping.


754
01:02:33.008 --> 01:02:35.212
Wouldn't want  you to lay down,

755
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.854
close your eyes and
never open them again.


756
01:02:40.698 --> 01:02:42.915
Go fuck yourself.

757
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.216
What?

758
01:02:45.457 --> 01:02:47.375
Trying to help you.

759
01:02:48.317 --> 01:02:51.066
Believe me. That's not
such a bad way to go.


760
01:02:51.091 --> 01:02:54.354
You just kind of...
drift off.


761
01:02:55.093 --> 01:02:58.057
Yeah? What dead mother fucker
did you hear that from?


762
01:03:01.497 --> 01:03:04.839
You know. I'm surprise
you haven't called for backup.


763
01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:06.410
Backup?

764
01:03:08.538 --> 01:03:10.894
That little girl IDs me.

765
01:03:11.598 --> 01:03:14.423
It's my ass, not my employers.

766
01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:18.598
My witness.
My problem.


767
01:03:19.687 --> 01:03:23.497
I'm a contractor, mister.
A professional.


768
01:03:24.278 --> 01:03:27.995
I don't lose.
I don't ask for help.


769
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.408
That's what keeps me employed.

770
01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:32.187
Yeah, well.

771
01:03:32.212 --> 01:03:34.470
It just gonna puts you
in the ground too


772
01:03:34.497 --> 01:03:37.504
you know,
throw in the towel soon, buddy.


773
01:03:37.529 --> 01:03:40.180
I mean, what the fuck
are we doing, man?


774
01:03:40.205 --> 01:03:43.238
This is like a pissing contest for you?

775
01:03:43.263 --> 01:03:48.002
Life ain't nothing but one big
fucking pissing contest, soldier boy


776
01:03:48.026 --> 01:03:50.453
Ain't you been paying attention?

777
01:03:50.479 --> 01:03:51.886
Shit.

778
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:56.491
I don't die unless the mother fucker
trying to kill me, earns it.


779
01:03:56.515 --> 01:03:58.426
You ain't earned it.

780
01:03:58.452 --> 01:04:03.151
Be damn if I let some chicken shit
like you take me out.


781
01:04:04.348 --> 01:04:06.674
You saying about me.

782
01:04:08.002 --> 01:04:10.946
I'm not the guy
you're fighting, am I?


783
01:04:11.964 --> 01:04:13.526
Yeah.

784
01:04:13.631 --> 01:04:16.350
I'm starting to understand.

785
01:04:17.734 --> 01:04:20.756
You'll never understand
a man like me, chump.


786
01:04:22.153 --> 01:04:25.709
Are you really the monster
you want me to think you are?


787
01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:29.229
You don't have a daughter, do you?

788
01:04:29.254 --> 01:04:31.182
Yeah, I got a daughter.

789
01:04:31.207 --> 01:04:33.546
What.
You think monsters don't breed?


790
01:04:33.571 --> 01:04:36.799
But, how did you get to be
what you are?


791
01:04:38.082 --> 01:04:40.774
Oh, what the fuck is it with you?

792
01:04:40.845 --> 01:04:44.671
You want to be my friend?
You want to be my shrink? Huh?


793
01:04:44.696 --> 01:04:49.075
Or you did just fall in love with
the velvet baritone of my voice.


794
01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.683
Come on, man.

795
01:04:52.002 --> 01:04:53.830
You want to know?

796
01:04:54.582 --> 01:04:56.462
Tough guy, huh?

797
01:04:57.691 --> 01:05:00.375
How you get to be like me?

798
01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.651
Jesus.

799
01:05:09.325 --> 01:05:10.937
Let's see.

800
01:05:11.225 --> 01:05:13.077
Oh, yeah.

801
01:05:14.013 --> 01:05:16.365
First guy I killed,

802
01:05:17.111 --> 01:05:19.194
brought me up, a bit.

803
01:05:19.606 --> 01:05:21.504
No, a lot.

804
01:05:22.042 --> 01:05:26.075
I couldn't eat,
couldn't sleep.


805
01:05:26.959 --> 01:05:29.651
Can't even look myself in the mirror.

806
01:05:30.131 --> 01:05:32.504
Then something strange happened.

807
01:05:32.814 --> 01:05:35.700
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.


808
01:05:35.944 --> 01:05:38.890
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.


809
01:05:39.296 --> 01:05:41.732
The fellow after that, better.

810
01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:44.888
Pretty soon, the more jobs
I got under my belt.


811
01:05:45.452 --> 01:05:47.903
The easier I slept at night.

812
01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:51.910
How many people would that take?

813
01:05:51.935 --> 01:05:55.455
I don't know, I don't count.
Let's just say.


814
01:05:55.915 --> 01:05:59.528
These days I sleep like a baby.

815
01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.091
I don't know.

816
01:06:01.116 --> 01:06:03.616
I don't know how you could
live with something like that.


817
01:06:04.073 --> 01:06:06.653
There's something I read once...

818
01:06:07.127 --> 01:06:09.127
stuck with me.

819
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:13.145
He who makes a beast of himself

820
01:06:14.993 --> 01:06:18.107
loses the pain of being a man.

821
01:06:18.401 --> 01:06:19.698
Wow.

822
01:06:21.388 --> 01:06:24.348
We all got our ways
in dealing with stuff.


823
01:06:26.185 --> 01:06:28.160
Guess for you, it's killing people.

824
01:06:28.185 --> 01:06:32.138
I kill 'cos it's my job,
I take orders.


825
01:06:33.087 --> 01:06:34.899
You were a soldier,
you know what that's like.


826
01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:38.089
Don't pull that card, pal.
We don't kill kids.


827
01:06:38.115 --> 01:06:41.298
I kill for 2 reasons.
Money and necessity.


828
01:06:41.602 --> 01:06:45.783
I don't kill for pleasure.
I never have, I never will.


829
01:06:45.807 --> 01:06:47.406
Well, why don't we
roll out Jerry Baker


830
01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:49.745
and ask him how
he feels about that, huh?


831
01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:53.738
I was... an intimidation tactic,
pure and simple.


832
01:06:55.413 --> 01:06:59.691
And I'm going to do whatever is necessary
to get a hold of that girl, you know that.


833
01:07:00.515 --> 01:07:02.555
She's got to go.

834
01:07:05.307 --> 01:07:09.375
You don't look the devil in the face
without taking the ride to the bottom floor


835
01:07:10.312 --> 01:07:12.100
The devil.

836
01:07:12.944 --> 01:07:15.788
You really are fucked in the head,
you know that?


837
01:07:15.888 --> 01:07:18.622
Ha.
So, now, I'm crazy, huh?


838
01:07:21.325 --> 01:07:23.604
Well, one of us must be.

839
01:07:50.209 --> 01:07:51.778
Carter.

840
01:07:53.734 --> 01:07:56.381
What?
You okay?


841
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:10.649
What's the matter?

842
01:08:11.577 --> 01:08:14.910
I'm sorry I got you into this.

843
01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:19.516
Got me into this.

844
01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:23.003
Bird.

845
01:08:24.002 --> 01:08:25.354
Hey.

846
01:08:25.437 --> 01:08:26.866
Hey.

847
01:08:28.435 --> 01:08:31.499
We're put together for a reason.

848
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:41.289
Lucky.

849
01:09:51.315 --> 01:09:53.433
What took you so long?

850
01:10:03.829 --> 01:10:05.793
Hey, partner!

851
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:08.111
Got somebody down here
who wants to talk to you.


852
01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:10.172
Go on, speak up, darling.

853
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:14.556
Carter.

854
01:10:14.593 --> 01:10:16.181
Mara?

855
01:10:16.586 --> 01:10:20.003
Bingo!
Found her number in your phone.


856
01:10:20.088 --> 01:10:21.807
Gave her a call.

857
01:10:22.048 --> 01:10:25.082
I told her I
was a friend of yours.

858
01:10:25.106 --> 01:10:28.539
And I was really worry about you.

859
01:10:31.567 --> 01:10:33.208
That you needed to
see her bad but


860
01:10:33.234 --> 01:10:35.989
you couldn't bring yourself
to make the call.


861
01:10:36.163 --> 01:10:37.721
That's where I come in.

862
01:10:37.745 --> 01:10:40.817
Being the close
loyal friend that I am.


863
01:10:40.842 --> 01:10:42.803
This poor woman drove
half the night to get here,


864
01:10:42.829 --> 01:10:44.405
ain't that right, ma'am?

865
01:10:45.988 --> 01:10:48.039
Carter, I'm sorry.

866
01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.391
He told me you were drinking,
I was worried about you.


867
01:10:51.415 --> 01:10:53.062
- You hush now, you hear?
- I'm sorry.


868
01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:54.668
So, what's it gonna be, sergeant Greene?

869
01:10:54.692 --> 01:10:56.511
Looks like we got
our tie breaker, huh?


870
01:10:56.535 --> 01:10:58.530
If you fucking hurt her, man!

871
01:10:58.561 --> 01:11:00.734
I swear to fucking Christ,

872
01:11:00.758 --> 01:11:04.449
you'll never get this kid.
YOU UNDERSTAND?


873
01:11:04.775 --> 01:11:07.408
Somehow, I doubt that, soldier boy.

874
01:11:07.432 --> 01:11:10.817
Well, besides,
she ain't seen my face yet.


875
01:11:11.137 --> 01:11:12.664
Have you, darling?

876
01:11:12.757 --> 01:11:14.070
No.

877
01:11:14.095 --> 01:11:16.828
Just like our old friend, Jerry Baker.
You remember him?


878
01:11:16.852 --> 01:11:18.619
That's right. If you don't send
the kid down here,


879
01:11:18.644 --> 01:11:20.235
she's going to get the same thing.

880
01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.707
This time, I'm not
going to be soft about it.


881
01:11:22.731 --> 01:11:24.382
You understand?

882
01:11:24.408 --> 01:11:27.547
I'm gonna do some real exploring.

883
01:11:28.104 --> 01:11:31.030
Really open her up,
see what she can do.


884
01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:33.092
So, you get your mind right,

885
01:11:33.124 --> 01:11:35.936
you send the girl
down here with that film,


886
01:11:35.962 --> 01:11:37.292
and you can have your wife back,

887
01:11:37.316 --> 01:11:39.588
and you all can get on back
to your happily ever after.


888
01:11:39.614 --> 01:11:41.686
How do I know I can trust you?

889
01:11:41.711 --> 01:11:43.427
You can't.

890
01:11:43.744 --> 01:11:47.479
But, if she was my wife,
I'll take the chance just the same.


891
01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:49.776
And seeing this how
we're here on your property,


892
01:11:49.802 --> 01:11:51.235
I'm gonna be real courteous and

893
01:11:51.261 --> 01:11:53.317
I'm gonna give you
to the count of five.


894
01:11:53.972 --> 01:11:55.685
Carter.

895
01:11:56.028 --> 01:11:57.600
Here we go.

896
01:11:59.012 --> 01:12:01.266
Carter, you promised.

897
01:12:01.292 --> 01:12:02.690
Five!

898
01:12:06.533 --> 01:12:08.445
Clock's ticking.

899
01:12:12.866 --> 01:12:14.803
Carter, please.

900
01:12:14.829 --> 01:12:17.073
Carter, please.
You promised.


901
01:12:17.097 --> 01:12:18.924
- Four!
- You promised.


902
01:12:19.262 --> 01:12:20.432
- Shhh.
- Please.


903
01:12:20.458 --> 01:12:21.642
Shut up!

904
01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.558
Here, you take this.

905
01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:27.879
Don't take too long.

906
01:12:27.905 --> 01:12:31.359
If he tries to come up 'em stairs,
you shoot him.


907
01:12:31.383 --> 01:12:33.208
It will knock you on your ass,
but, you'll hit him


908
01:12:33.232 --> 01:12:35.739
if you just aim downstairs, okay?

909
01:12:35.763 --> 01:12:37.190
It aims real wide.

910
01:12:37.216 --> 01:12:38.174
Three!

911
01:12:38.199 --> 01:12:40.453
What? No.
What are you doing?


912
01:12:42.433 --> 01:12:44.923
I'm going to go see my son.

913
01:12:46.982 --> 01:12:48.645
Carter.

914
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:49.692
Shhh.

915
01:12:49.717 --> 01:12:51.021
Two!

916
01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:56.405
Come on, sergeant Greene,
don't be stupid.


917
01:12:58.705 --> 01:13:00.007
Alright, that's it.
One.


918
01:13:00.033 --> 01:13:02.091
- Carter.
- Alright!


919
01:13:02.115 --> 01:13:03.383
Okay.

920
01:13:03.409 --> 01:13:05.705
You make the right choice.

921
01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:07.647
I'm proud of you.

922
01:13:07.672 --> 01:13:09.918
Alright, you come on.
You send her down.


923
01:13:10.373 --> 01:13:12.511
You can have your wife.

924
01:13:18.329 --> 01:13:19.653
Carter.

925
01:13:20.266 --> 01:13:21.990
Are you okay?

926
01:13:22.016 --> 01:13:23.574
- Are you okay...
- Shhh!


927
01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:29.546
Well, not that it ain't
nice to see your ugly mug.


928
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:33.078
But, what the fuck are you doing?

929
01:13:33.102 --> 01:13:34.324
I couldn't do it, man.

930
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:36.113
I can't send that little girl down here.

931
01:13:36.137 --> 01:13:38.627
I can see that!
Where's the 20 gauge?


932
01:13:38.651 --> 01:13:40.312
She's got it.

933
01:13:40.498 --> 01:13:42.064
You want her?

934
01:13:43.106 --> 01:13:44.905
Go get her.

935
01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:46.526
Are you fucking kidding me?

936
01:13:46.552 --> 01:13:50.132
All she's got to do,
is aim down that stairwell


937
01:13:50.156 --> 01:13:51.579
and pull the fucking trigger, man.

938
01:13:51.604 --> 01:13:53.562
You're drunk,
you're slow.


939
01:13:53.588 --> 01:13:55.672
It'll be like shooting
a fish in a barrel.


940
01:13:55.698 --> 01:13:57.396
That's brilliant.

941
01:13:57.659 --> 01:14:00.217
That's fucking brilliant, soldier boy.

942
01:14:00.427 --> 01:14:03.211
Just go home.
Go home to your daughter.


943
01:14:03.235 --> 01:14:06.454
I don't have a fucking daughter!
I fucking hate kids!


944
01:14:06.479 --> 01:14:09.271
What the fuck does it matter, man?
You win.


945
01:14:09.297 --> 01:14:10.705
You fucking coward!

946
01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:13.316
You didn't have the balls
to make the call, did you?


947
01:14:13.341 --> 01:14:14.181
No!

948
01:14:14.207 --> 01:14:16.314
You give up your responsibility
to the little girl.


949
01:14:16.338 --> 01:14:20.586
And you came crawling down here
with your dick in your fucking hand


950
01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:23.074
to grovel like a dog for mercy!

951
01:14:23.098 --> 01:14:25.100
Fuck you.
I don't do mercy!


952
01:14:25.124 --> 01:14:27.155
I'm gonna do you
both a favor and


953
01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:30.629
end your miserable
fucking lives right now!


954
01:14:30.655 --> 01:14:32.307
Hold on!

955
01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:35.486
Oh, come on, man.
What the hell is that gonna solve, huh?


956
01:14:35.512 --> 01:14:37.235
I thought you didn't
kill for pleasure.


957
01:14:37.261 --> 01:14:40.074
Ain't you been listening?
Huh?


958
01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:43.754
Have I been talking on my ass
all mother fucking day


959
01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:48.260
I'd have told you I have prostate cancer,
if I thought it would help.


960
01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:50.428
- We haven't seen your face,
- Oh, no?


961
01:14:50.454 --> 01:14:52.257
Well, here!
Now, you have.


962
01:14:52.283 --> 01:14:54.588
Nice to fucking meet you.

963
01:14:54.789 --> 01:14:56.337
Carter!

964
01:14:56.973 --> 01:14:58.680
Time's up, girl.

965
01:14:58.704 --> 01:15:01.708
You need to bring your ass down here,
before I killed your brand new daddy.


966
01:15:01.732 --> 01:15:03.332
No, Bird, no.

967
01:15:03.356 --> 01:15:05.917
You stay!
You, stay!


968
01:15:05.941 --> 01:15:08.399
Your choice, Princess.

969
01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.144
How many people got
to die because of you?


970
01:15:11.168 --> 01:15:15.137
She's just a kid for Christ sake.
There's no way.


971
01:15:19.078 --> 01:15:21.038
Atta girl, come to papa.

972
01:15:21.062 --> 01:15:24.927
Bird, no! You stay up there.
Go back!


973
01:15:24.952 --> 01:15:26.547
Oh, my god.

974
01:15:33.307 --> 01:15:34.369
Damn, girl.

975
01:15:34.395 --> 01:15:36.685
You know, you're about
the toughest mark I ever had!


976
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:38.573
- Whoa.
- Bird, don't!


977
01:15:38.597 --> 01:15:39.879
What the?

978
01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:54.784
Come on, honey.

979
01:16:04.385 --> 01:16:07.209
Honey, get back here.
Where're you going?


980
01:16:18.627 --> 01:16:21.395
We need help, right away.
Please come, right away.


981
01:16:28.589 --> 01:16:30.212
He's been shot.

982
01:16:31.116 --> 01:16:33.387
We need an ambulance, right away.

983
01:16:34.279 --> 01:16:36.167
Hi, pumpkin.

984
01:16:39.025 --> 01:16:40.986
Scary, huh?

985
01:16:43.949 --> 01:16:45.422
No.

986
01:16:51.404 --> 01:16:52.760
Do it.

987
01:16:55.926 --> 01:16:57.325
Do it.

988
01:17:07.534 --> 01:17:09.677
A fucking dud?

989
01:17:14.431 --> 01:17:19.748
All this god damn time.
A fucking dud.


990
01:17:30.311 --> 01:17:32.280
Just do it.

991
01:17:37.007 --> 01:17:39.562
What do you think I am?

992
01:17:41.714 --> 01:17:45.504
Some kind of monster?

993
01:18:21.195 --> 01:18:22.712
Carter?

994
01:18:34.783 --> 01:18:36.982
Carter, please.

995
01:18:47.012 --> 01:18:48.632
Please.

996
01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.760
Please, what?

997
01:19:07.754 --> 01:19:09.641
Where's your camera?

998
01:19:11.797 --> 01:19:14.196
I guess I took it off.

999
01:19:17.424 --> 01:19:19.396
I guess you did.

1000
01:19:22.601 --> 01:19:24.793
You saved me.

1001
01:19:30.511 --> 01:19:33.102
I just returned a favor.

1002
01:19:37.692 --> 01:19:40.092
You're going to be okay, right?

1003
01:19:41.406 --> 01:19:43.531
Don't you worry.

1004
01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:46.637
There ain't no quitting me.

1005
01:20:23.329 --> 01:20:26.209
