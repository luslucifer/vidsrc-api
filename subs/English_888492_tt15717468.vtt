A FORBIDDEN ORANGE

2
00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.766
'A Clockwork Orange'
was released at the end of 1971


3
00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:46.635
in New York

4
00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:52.140
and in January, 1972, in London.

5
00:03:56.244 --> 00:03:58.246
The film had a big impact on me

6
00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:02.784
but also frustrated me

7
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:05.687
because I didn't understand
some of the dialogues.


8
00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:07.456
Of course,

9
00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:12.627
many years later,
I found out that in the film


10
00:04:12.694 --> 00:04:14.663
they were speaking
in a made-up language.


11
00:04:17.332 --> 00:04:22.270
'A Clockwork Orange' was
preceded by the scent of scandal.


12
00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:28.643
Many said it was immoral and
cruel,


13
00:04:28.744 --> 00:04:31.446
that it favoured crime, etc.

14
00:04:36.051 --> 00:04:38.687
At one point it was like an
anathema,


15
00:04:39.554 --> 00:04:43.525
a persecution even.

16
00:04:44.526 --> 00:04:47.295
People didn't consider
the values of the film,


17
00:04:47.362 --> 00:04:52.134
it was supposedly morally
corrupt


18
00:04:52.234 --> 00:04:56.738
and this made Kubrick

19
00:04:56.805 --> 00:04:59.608
decide to withdraw the film.

20
00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:04.513
He removed it from the cinemas

21
00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:07.949
not wanting to feed
into something that he said


22
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.620
was extra-cinematographic.

23
00:05:55.363 --> 00:05:58.533
The film had a big impact

24
00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:02.737
all over the world

25
00:06:02.804 --> 00:06:06.208
and, at the same time,
it disappeared.


26
00:06:06.808 --> 00:06:12.347
It had the aura of a cursed
film.


27
00:06:57.225 --> 00:06:59.427
Spain is spilling its blood

28
00:06:59.494 --> 00:07:01.730
in the defence of civilisation.

29
00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:23.985
Back then, the majors had no
control.


30
00:07:24.052 --> 00:07:27.856
Franco said that the money
made from American films


31
00:07:28.223 --> 00:07:30.192
had to stay Spain.

32
00:07:30.258 --> 00:07:36.131
He even made it obligatory
for all profits and royalties


33
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:38.533
paid for American films

34
00:07:38.633 --> 00:07:40.769
to be invested in Spanish
production.


35
00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:20.508
I've governed this state for 30
years


36
00:08:20.575 --> 00:08:23.778
saving the nation
from the storms of our times


37
00:08:23.845 --> 00:08:26.715
and, despite it all, I'm still
here, ready for anything.


38
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.089
SPAIN IS WITH FRANCO

39
00:08:49.471 --> 00:08:51.706
WELCOME TO VALLADOLID

40
00:08:57.345 --> 00:09:02.550
In the 70s, Valladolid
was an important university city


41
00:09:02.617 --> 00:09:04.486
and a big industrial city.

42
00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:07.656
The Renault factory was here,

43
00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:08.990
FASA
-Renault.

44
00:09:11.626 --> 00:09:16.231
Back then,
FASA had 15,000 workers


45
00:09:16.298 --> 00:09:20.869
so the province of Valladolid
became depopulated


46
00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:24.873
and a many people
moved to the capital.


47
00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:31.780
Up until then, Valladolid
had been a typically rural city.


48
00:09:32.314 --> 00:09:35.784
The rural landowners
were the ones in charge.


49
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.020
Everything developed with FASA
and blended together more


50
00:09:39.087 --> 00:09:41.856
but the social differences
were still quite obvious.


51
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.993
The neighbourhoods
were very ordinary,


52
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.664
the living conditions
were terrible


53
00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:51.466
and the centre...

54
00:09:51.533 --> 00:09:54.669
The people that lived in the
centre


55
00:09:54.736 --> 00:09:57.939
were bourgeois families
and there weren't many of them.


56
00:09:58.006 --> 00:10:01.209
It's a city where the
bourgeoisie are very connected


57
00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:05.447
with the rural world
so it's rather conservative


58
00:10:05.547 --> 00:10:08.583
and was very devoted
to Catholicism at the time.


59
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.052
It wasn't completely Catholic,

60
00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.488
that would be excessive,

61
00:10:13.888 --> 00:10:17.826
but it gave the impression
of a Catholic city


62
00:10:17.892 --> 00:10:20.662
with deeply-rooted traditions.

63
00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:23.498
The Procession of the
Seven Words in Valladolid


64
00:10:23.565 --> 00:10:27.168
covers the city on horseback to
the beat of drums and trumpets


65
00:10:27.268 --> 00:10:28.670
as is fitting for a town

66
00:10:28.737 --> 00:10:30.739
with a clear lineage
of a noble cavalry.


67
00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:32.774
The city has 20
confraternities...


68
00:10:33.942 --> 00:10:37.512
There was also
a buzzing university scene.


69
00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:40.048
There was a lot of activity,
not only in faculties


70
00:10:40.148 --> 00:10:42.384
but in the colleges too.

71
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.085
There were lots of activities.

72
00:10:44.786 --> 00:10:50.024
One thing that wasn't so common
and easy for people to access


73
00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:52.227
was a normal level of culture.

74
00:10:52.293 --> 00:10:55.663
We were at home most of the
time.


75
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:58.299
We did go to the cinema.

76
00:10:58.733 --> 00:10:59.734
We went a lot.

77
00:11:00.168 --> 00:11:03.071
Sometimes three or four times a
week.


78
00:11:07.108 --> 00:11:08.777
UNCLE TOM'S CABIN

79
00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.950
I worked in a bank

80
00:11:16.017 --> 00:11:19.888
but in the afternoon
I worked at the family cinema.


81
00:11:23.324 --> 00:11:26.428
The seating area at the Roxy
Cinema was my playground.


82
00:11:26.494 --> 00:11:30.265
I learnt how to run the box office,
I helped them move the seats,


83
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:34.269
I hid behind the curtains
to see a bit of the adult film.


84
00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:40.341
Back then, cinema
was the best distraction.


85
00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:41.509
It was my world.

86
00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:46.548
The first session was at 5 p.m.

87
00:11:47.115 --> 00:11:50.018
and we wouldn't just
get 20 or 30 customers,


88
00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:52.887
we'd get 400 or 500.

89
00:11:53.455 --> 00:11:55.623
It was constantly sold out.

90
00:11:57.192 --> 00:11:58.993
It's some of my best memories.

91
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.261
Your parents took you

92
00:12:00.328 --> 00:12:03.164
and you grew up with that
fondness for the cinema,


93
00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:04.299
it was so important.

94
00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:08.303
There are few places
I've been happier


95
00:12:08.369 --> 00:12:10.171
than in one of those cinemas.

96
00:12:11.306 --> 00:12:12.474
The lights went down

97
00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:16.811
and you waited anxiously
for that beam of light


98
00:12:16.911 --> 00:12:20.715
to fill the screen with images.

99
00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.750
It was an absolutely magical
moment.


100
00:12:22.817 --> 00:12:26.354
You were waiting
for one of life's wonders.


101
00:12:28.723 --> 00:12:32.794
For me, the cinema
was a break from everyday life.


102
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:36.631
It was a fantasy world but also
closely linked with reality,


103
00:12:37.065 --> 00:12:39.667
with wanting a different world.

104
00:12:40.068 --> 00:12:42.670
Through motion pictures,

105
00:12:43.071 --> 00:12:46.674
people discovered,
people travelled,


106
00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:48.710
people formed an opinion.

107
00:12:48.776 --> 00:12:53.648
I think that cinema changed the
pace of culture in Valladolid.


108
00:12:53.748 --> 00:12:56.818
First, because of
the university scene


109
00:12:56.885 --> 00:13:01.623
but Film Week
was also a decisive push.


110
00:13:01.689 --> 00:13:03.525
I loved Film Week

111
00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.427
because it changed the city.

112
00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:10.632
Suddenly, there were new things
to see in Valladolid.


113
00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:17.305
I came to Valladolid in 1964.

114
00:13:17.372 --> 00:13:20.108
I had passed my exams

115
00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:24.178
to work for the Superior Body
of State Administration


116
00:13:24.245 --> 00:13:27.348
and I specifically
requested Valladolid


117
00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:29.784
because of International Film
Week.


118
00:13:31.152 --> 00:13:33.454
The festival was founded

119
00:13:33.555 --> 00:13:37.392
by Antolín de Santiago y Juárez,

120
00:13:37.458 --> 00:13:39.661
Manager of Information and
Tourism,


121
00:13:39.727 --> 00:13:43.531
a man with a gift for
organisation.


122
00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:49.370
He wanted to set up
a religious film festival.


123
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.776
The festival was an extension
of the Holy Week.


124
00:13:56.911 --> 00:13:59.447
It started with a mass

125
00:13:59.914 --> 00:14:04.419
which all of the guests
attended.


126
00:14:05.153 --> 00:14:08.656
The fact that there were nuns and
priests there was a talking point


127
00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:11.726
and they actually seemed
the most interested in it.


128
00:14:11.826 --> 00:14:13.061
RELIGIOUS CINEMA WEEK

129
00:14:13.127 --> 00:14:15.964
The first session

130
00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:18.099
was for religious films

131
00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:23.104
and they showed a controversial
film that people complained about.


132
00:14:27.475 --> 00:14:29.344
But the festival had to expand

133
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.615
because there weren't
that many good religious films


134
00:14:33.715 --> 00:14:38.353
and it started
to include human problems.


135
00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:42.023
That was a big deal for the
festival


136
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.226
because it could now show
all types of films.


137
00:14:45.293 --> 00:14:47.295
And it was called

138
00:14:47.395 --> 00:14:50.365
Religious and Human Values
Film Festival.


139
00:14:50.932 --> 00:14:54.969
It's an umbrella term
that covers so many things:


140
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:57.472
social cinema, political cinema,

141
00:14:57.538 --> 00:15:01.609
cinema from a humanist
point of view...


142
00:15:01.709 --> 00:15:04.812
I said there was room for
everything,


143
00:15:04.912 --> 00:15:09.617
even eroticism, because eroticism
is something profoundly human.


144
00:15:09.684 --> 00:15:15.023
It triggered broad discussion.

145
00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:16.991
It was a big change.

146
00:15:19.394 --> 00:15:22.664
They suggested risqué films,

147
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.365
difficult films,

148
00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.367
controversial films.

149
00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:29.937
You weren't sure
which planet they came from.


150
00:15:31.739 --> 00:15:34.942
You probably couldn't see what
came to Seminci anywhere else.


151
00:15:35.009 --> 00:15:39.380
We started getting films
from beyond the Iron Curtain


152
00:15:39.447 --> 00:15:42.250
that were hardly shown anywhere
else.


153
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.087
We had Felini's films,
Rossellini's films...


154
00:15:46.788 --> 00:15:47.889
Ingmar Bergman.

155
00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:50.525
We had La Nouvelle Vague too.

156
00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:51.793
François Truffaut.

157
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.896
Finally, we managed to get
Buñuel.


158
00:15:56.264 --> 00:15:59.067
And we showed '
The Milky Way'

159
00:15:59.133 --> 00:16:00.535
and 'Simon of the Desert'.

160
00:16:01.102 --> 00:16:04.572
It was incredible but it
got us into two tight spots.


161
00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:06.207
First with the archbishop

162
00:16:07.075 --> 00:16:09.177
who almost
got into a fight with Antolín.


163
00:16:09.243 --> 00:16:12.547
And then
with the cinematography course


164
00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:15.616
which was run by Father Staehlin
and Father Landáburu


165
00:16:16.284 --> 00:16:18.386
who were also
annoyed about the festival.


166
00:16:18.453 --> 00:16:20.788
There was a kind of tension:

167
00:16:20.855 --> 00:16:23.491
"We're going ahead with it
but it'll cause a scene."


168
00:16:25.093 --> 00:16:29.530
They showed 'The Virgin Spring'

169
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.866
which has a rape scene
and all sorts


170
00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:35.970
and there was a bit of a panic
because there were nuns there.


171
00:16:36.404 --> 00:16:39.674
It seemed strange
to show Bergman's films


172
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:42.110
in Religious Film Week

173
00:16:42.176 --> 00:16:46.547
and to see disturbing films...

174
00:16:46.614 --> 00:16:50.451
you didn't know how to feel
about what you just saw.


175
00:16:52.987 --> 00:16:55.857
It was a cultural effervescence

176
00:16:55.923 --> 00:16:59.627
made possible by Film Week.

177
00:16:59.694 --> 00:17:02.497
They showed films

178
00:17:03.364 --> 00:17:05.233
that really shocked people

179
00:17:05.633 --> 00:17:08.503
but everyone still
wanted to see them.


180
00:17:09.103 --> 00:17:14.542
The cinemas were sold out
every single day in Film Week.


181
00:17:15.042 --> 00:17:20.381
For me, Film Week
opened my mind up to the world.


182
00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:34.996
Intellectual and cultural
curiosity


183
00:17:35.062 --> 00:17:38.299
was rife among young people.

184
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.204
With censorship ever present,

185
00:17:43.304 --> 00:17:45.706
they looked for subterfuges

186
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:50.611
and ways to keep the flame of
culture alive however they could.


187
00:18:12.733 --> 00:18:17.071
On the churches' religious
notice boards


188
00:18:17.138 --> 00:18:19.473
next to the scheduled masses

189
00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.845
you'd find the events' moral
ratings.


190
00:18:23.945 --> 00:18:25.646
You could look up the films

191
00:18:25.746 --> 00:18:28.449
and were only supposed
to watch the ones rated one,


192
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:30.451
suitable for all audiences.

193
00:18:41.562 --> 00:18:46.834
Franco's regime was most strict
about cinematic censorship.


194
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:50.605
It was easy to do across many
levels,


195
00:18:50.705 --> 00:18:55.543
not just in the traditional way
of cutting the footage,


196
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.947
but also by introducing
a verbal censorship


197
00:19:00.014 --> 00:19:02.183
which meant changing the
dialogues.


198
00:19:02.683 --> 00:19:06.020
There's the famous case
of the film 'Mogambo'


199
00:19:06.087 --> 00:19:08.856
where censorship was used

200
00:19:08.923 --> 00:19:13.995
to make the romantic
relationships clearer


201
00:19:14.061 --> 00:19:17.098
but they actually made it
so that there was incest


202
00:19:17.164 --> 00:19:19.634
instead of adultery,

203
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:24.171
which is a much bigger sin.

204
00:19:24.272 --> 00:19:28.409
Besides those manipulations,

205
00:19:28.509 --> 00:19:31.012
omissions and changes,

206
00:19:31.112 --> 00:19:36.684
the worst thing was not getting films
that were being shown elsewhere.


207
00:19:36.784 --> 00:19:40.421
We didn't get the risqué films,

208
00:19:41.188 --> 00:19:45.026
neither the erotic ones

209
00:19:45.092 --> 00:19:47.261
nor the political ones.

210
00:19:47.328 --> 00:19:51.299
For example,
Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory',


211
00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:55.703
the anti-war film
which was one of his best works,


212
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.405
didn't make it here.

213
00:20:43.384 --> 00:20:46.053
Francoism was terrible.

214
00:20:46.153 --> 00:20:50.491
It was so dark and so brutal,

215
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:52.827
something beyond comparison.

216
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.164
Everything that was
most in touch with the times,


217
00:20:57.264 --> 00:21:02.103
that modernity
that you longed to be a part of,


218
00:21:02.169 --> 00:21:04.005
was completely blocked.

219
00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:04.965
The Police claim
she has committed cruel acts.


220
00:22:05.066 --> 00:22:06.233
Yes, an interesting case.

221
00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:22.783
We'll try to make you useful

222
00:22:24.351 --> 00:22:25.653
in accordance with the law.

223
00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:12.299
It's time for
our third film programme


224
00:23:12.366 --> 00:23:14.668
where you can see the film
'A Clockwork Orange',


225
00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:18.372
produced in 1971 by Warner Bros.

226
00:23:18.739 --> 00:23:20.341
And directed by Stanley Kubrick.

227
00:23:41.295 --> 00:23:43.464
MR. HERCULES AGAINST KARATE

228
00:23:58.012 --> 00:24:01.182
You either went to secret
or clandestine screenings


229
00:24:01.248 --> 00:24:02.816
or you had to go abroad.

230
00:24:04.952 --> 00:24:08.956
Visiting Paris was more
than just the Eiffel Tower


231
00:24:09.023 --> 00:24:10.457
or the Champs-Élysées,

232
00:24:10.524 --> 00:24:14.662
it also meant discovering the
cinemas


233
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:19.733
and Buñuel's films
that hadn't made it to Spain,


234
00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:21.335
along with other directors.

235
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.541
On the weekend in Catalonia,
especially in Barcelona,


236
00:24:27.608 --> 00:24:31.512
they organised trips to
Perpignan


237
00:24:31.579 --> 00:24:34.815
to see films like 'Emanuelle'
or 'Last Tango In Paris'.


238
00:24:34.915 --> 00:24:38.385
It was like La Rambla over
there,


239
00:24:38.452 --> 00:24:40.654
everyone knew and greeted each
other.


240
00:24:40.754 --> 00:24:43.624
Then they did a marathon
viewing.


241
00:24:43.691 --> 00:24:47.394
The screenings started at 3 p.m.

242
00:24:47.461 --> 00:24:49.730
and then they would run
to another cinema


243
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:54.268
because they had tickets
to watch two more films,


244
00:24:54.335 --> 00:24:56.904
erotic ones, and others
that were banned in Spain.


245
00:25:08.449 --> 00:25:11.452
I saw it in Montreal, in Canada,

246
00:25:11.552 --> 00:25:16.223
in 1973, something like that.

247
00:25:16.824 --> 00:25:21.228
I thought it would be difficult
for this to make it to Spain,


248
00:25:21.295 --> 00:25:23.297
the censorship was very strict

249
00:25:23.364 --> 00:25:28.269
and the chances of us getting it
were very slim.


250
00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:30.204
I put it to
the back of my mind

251
00:25:30.571 --> 00:25:34.608
and then in 1975

252
00:25:34.708 --> 00:25:36.543
I directed the festival

253
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.514
and the possibility of showing
'A Clockwork Orange' came up.


254
00:25:45.953 --> 00:25:48.656
Warner Bros. called me

255
00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:54.695
and said: "Hey, we're interested
in showing 'A Clockwork Orange'"


256
00:25:54.795 --> 00:25:55.795
in Valladolid

257
00:25:56.964 --> 00:26:00.367
"and the General Bureau
of Cinema has agreed."


258
00:26:03.504 --> 00:26:08.208
The simple fact that the
General Bureau of Cinema


259
00:26:08.309 --> 00:26:10.644
and the distributor,
Warner Bros.,


260
00:26:11.512 --> 00:26:16.083
were considering
giving Valladolid a chance


261
00:26:16.183 --> 00:26:18.385
gave us a certain status.

262
00:26:18.452 --> 00:26:21.488
The stars aligned
because, in February,


263
00:26:21.588 --> 00:26:24.325
there was a post
in the State Official Bulletin


264
00:26:24.692 --> 00:26:28.028
saying that the censorship
control system had been suspended.


265
00:26:32.099 --> 00:26:34.068
The regime's leaders also
realised


266
00:26:34.134 --> 00:26:36.503
that this couldn't go on
for much longer


267
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.907
and maybe saw the film
as a way to show people


268
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:43.777
that they could be modern too

269
00:26:43.844 --> 00:26:46.613
by showing things that were
controversial and risqué.


270
00:26:46.714 --> 00:26:48.716
A propagandistic way

271
00:26:48.782 --> 00:26:52.653
of showing that the regimen
was starting to change.


272
00:26:52.753 --> 00:26:56.090
In Spain, it was a milestone

273
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.895
to think that 'A Clockwork
Orange' might be shown in cinemas


274
00:27:01.995 --> 00:27:03.163
relatively soon.

275
00:27:42.736 --> 00:27:46.473
They did an experiment
in Valladolid in 1974


276
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.510
and there was quite a commotion

277
00:27:50.043 --> 00:27:52.112
at the doors of a cinema

278
00:27:52.179 --> 00:27:54.748
that was showing
'Jesus Christ Superstar'.


279
00:27:57.684 --> 00:27:59.086
There was a real outcry,

280
00:27:59.186 --> 00:28:01.555
and it's funny
because the film isn't...


281
00:28:01.622 --> 00:28:04.658
So much so
that 'Jesus Christ Superstar'


282
00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:09.730
was authorised on a Friday
to be shown on a Sunday


283
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.934
by the Council of Ministers

284
00:28:14.034 --> 00:28:16.069
headed by Franco himself.

285
00:28:16.804 --> 00:28:18.405
With that in mind,

286
00:28:18.505 --> 00:28:23.444
when they suggested
that we screen


287
00:28:23.844 --> 00:28:27.047
'A Clockwork Orange'
we decided to go ahead


288
00:28:27.147 --> 00:28:30.684
thinking we'd be dropping
a bomb, and we sure were.


289
00:29:02.015 --> 00:29:04.351
CONFLICTIVE CITY

290
00:29:04.418 --> 00:29:05.619
PEACEFUL RALLY

291
00:29:05.686 --> 00:29:06.954
THE STRIKE

292
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.422
POLITICAL STRIKE

293
00:29:08.489 --> 00:29:09.790
PROTEST MARCH

294
00:29:09.857 --> 00:29:13.093
FASA Renault went on strike,
so did construction...


295
00:29:13.193 --> 00:29:17.331
The neighbourhoods were destroyed,
there was a lot of social activity.


296
00:29:17.431 --> 00:29:20.934
Other industries were also on
strike, fighting over agreements


297
00:29:21.034 --> 00:29:23.203
and the improvement
of working conditions.


298
00:29:25.706 --> 00:29:28.809
Lock-ins and assemblies
in churches were common


299
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:31.612
and some working priests

300
00:29:31.712 --> 00:29:35.449
said they were sent by the
church to catechize the workers


301
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:38.185
and then the workers
ended up unionising them.


302
00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.396
MADRID, BARCELONA AND SALAMANCA
UNIVERSITIES ON FULL STRIKE


303
00:29:49.463 --> 00:29:52.332
WARNING NOTES IN UNIVERSITIES

304
00:29:52.432 --> 00:29:54.668
Valladolid had
a population of 200,000 people


305
00:29:55.536 --> 00:29:57.971
and 30,000 of them were students

306
00:29:58.071 --> 00:30:02.242
so the political atmosphere
was quite combative.


307
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.952
In 1975,

308
00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:16.823
I was studying English philology
at the University of Valladolid.


309
00:30:18.058 --> 00:30:21.662
A singer songwriter, Elisa
Serna, came to perform a concert


310
00:30:21.728 --> 00:30:23.897
which was later banned.

311
00:30:25.732 --> 00:30:28.235
However, the concert went ahead

312
00:30:28.302 --> 00:30:32.739
because the ministerial order
stated


313
00:30:32.806 --> 00:30:35.008
that the Police
couldn't access the campus


314
00:30:35.108 --> 00:30:38.946
so it wasn't a problem.

315
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:43.617
But that's not what happened,
the Police came in


316
00:30:43.684 --> 00:30:47.621
using their batons
to break up the concert.


317
00:30:47.688 --> 00:30:49.323
We all scrambled to get out

318
00:30:49.423 --> 00:30:54.027
but some were luckier than
others


319
00:30:54.094 --> 00:30:58.265
and several of us got a good
beating.


320
00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:03.604
My father was Republican and
a reprisal victim and he said:


321
00:31:03.704 --> 00:31:08.508
"My girl, this is all very well
but ideas are one thing


322
00:31:08.575 --> 00:31:10.644
and political activism is
another."


323
00:31:11.745 --> 00:31:15.949
That concert changed the University
of Valladolid completely.


324
00:31:16.016 --> 00:31:20.220
To set an example

325
00:31:20.754 --> 00:31:23.223
for other universities,

326
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.493
the government decided
to end the academic year.


327
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.963
THE CLOSURE OF THE UNIVERSITY

328
00:31:30.063 --> 00:31:31.565
The university closed,

329
00:31:32.165 --> 00:31:35.936
a decision made by the
then-rector, José Ramón del Sol.


330
00:31:36.003 --> 00:31:38.672
He came out
of the Faculty of Medicine


331
00:31:38.739 --> 00:31:42.109
and there was an assembly
in the street


332
00:31:42.175 --> 00:31:43.777
with people throwing eggs

333
00:31:43.844 --> 00:31:46.813
and calling for him to resign.

334
00:31:46.913 --> 00:31:51.652
That made the academic
authorities get together


335
00:31:51.752 --> 00:31:54.621
and put up a note saying that,

336
00:31:54.688 --> 00:31:56.923
because of the trouble
at the university,


337
00:31:57.024 --> 00:32:01.328
all academic activity
was suspended indefinitely.


338
00:32:01.428 --> 00:32:06.166
The regimen was very
much alive in Valladolid


339
00:32:06.266 --> 00:32:07.634
and other parts of the state

340
00:32:08.368 --> 00:32:12.673
and the punishment for belonging
to certain political organisations


341
00:32:12.739 --> 00:32:14.408
even involved prison.

342
00:32:14.508 --> 00:32:18.512
The Political-Social Brigade
that had been at its peak


343
00:32:18.912 --> 00:32:22.482
and seemed to have died down
towards the end of the 60s


344
00:32:23.083 --> 00:32:27.354
recovered its bad reputation

345
00:32:27.421 --> 00:32:30.691
with mass arrests at the
university


346
00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:34.327
and among FASA
-Renault workers.

347
00:32:34.428 --> 00:32:36.296
A group of students
from the university


348
00:32:36.363 --> 00:32:38.265
were sentenced to years in
prison


349
00:32:38.331 --> 00:32:42.269
and one of them

350
00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:46.540
had what was supposedly an accident
at the Felipe II Police Station.


351
00:32:46.606 --> 00:32:48.408
They said he tried to flee

352
00:32:48.809 --> 00:32:50.977
via the interior patios
of the station


353
00:32:51.578 --> 00:32:56.349
but Cancho has always said
that they threw him


354
00:32:56.683 --> 00:33:01.621
from inside the station
onto the interior patio.


355
00:33:08.929 --> 00:33:12.933
Imagine all of those
continuous combustions


356
00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:16.670
in a city with a relatively
small population,


357
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.406
and then overnight

358
00:33:19.506 --> 00:33:23.777
the Seminci announced
that, in April,


359
00:33:23.844 --> 00:33:25.779
to celebrate its 20th edition,

360
00:33:25.846 --> 00:33:30.817
there would be a special
screening of 'A Clockwork Orange'.


361
00:33:30.884 --> 00:33:34.354
It shook up the cultural scene.

362
00:33:34.421 --> 00:33:37.457
It was a war-like challenge

363
00:33:37.524 --> 00:33:40.327
to show something
that wasn't approved of


364
00:33:40.427 --> 00:33:43.363
and had caused such conflict.

365
00:33:43.463 --> 00:33:45.732
Expectations were really high.

366
00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:20.167
Fifteen or twenty days
before the festival,


367
00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:22.235
Warner Bros. called me and said:

368
00:34:22.302 --> 00:34:27.374
"Look, we want to check your
copy"


369
00:34:27.808 --> 00:34:29.009
of 'A Clockwork Orange'

370
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:33.747
"because we're not sure
it's in perfect condition."


371
00:34:33.814 --> 00:34:38.652
So, the copy of the film
left Valladolid


372
00:34:38.752 --> 00:34:39.786
and headed for Madrid.

373
00:34:44.057 --> 00:34:47.861
But two days
after sending the film back


374
00:34:47.928 --> 00:34:51.464
Warner Bros. called me again:
"Look, we're really sorry,


375
00:34:51.832 --> 00:34:56.403
but Kubrick won't authorise
the screening of this film."


376
00:34:56.503 --> 00:34:57.503
You're kidding?

377
00:34:58.405 --> 00:34:59.773
We couldn't believe it...

378
00:34:59.873 --> 00:35:04.411
It was just over a week
before the festival.


379
00:35:06.513 --> 00:35:10.817
Kubrick didn't think that
Valladolid was the right place


380
00:35:10.884 --> 00:35:16.790
to release and present
the film in Spain.


381
00:35:16.857 --> 00:35:20.527
He had probably heard
that Valladolid still had


382
00:35:20.627 --> 00:35:23.296
an international reputation

383
00:35:23.363 --> 00:35:27.334
for being strongly linked
to religious cinema.


384
00:35:27.434 --> 00:35:30.070
I also think he heard

385
00:35:31.404 --> 00:35:34.774
that at the Valladolid Festival

386
00:35:34.875 --> 00:35:38.311
the 35mm projection equipment

387
00:35:38.378 --> 00:35:43.483
wasn't good enough
to guarantee the screening


388
00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.354
that he wanted for the film.

389
00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.258
He was an obsessive
perfectionist.


390
00:35:55.462 --> 00:35:58.431
I spent a whole week with him,

391
00:35:59.065 --> 00:36:00.934
every day, for many hours,

392
00:36:01.434 --> 00:36:04.671
when I started working
on the translation


393
00:36:05.272 --> 00:36:07.540
and subsequent dubbing
of The Shining.


394
00:36:07.607 --> 00:36:09.709
I'd done A Clockwork Orange
before


395
00:36:09.776 --> 00:36:13.613
and I was thrilled to be staying
in a big hotel next to his house.


396
00:36:14.047 --> 00:36:16.816
One day,
I asked him for something


397
00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:21.021
that I knew
he didn't want to give me,


398
00:36:21.087 --> 00:36:22.622
an interview.

399
00:36:49.015 --> 00:36:51.851
I never felt
like I was talking to a star


400
00:36:52.786 --> 00:36:54.788
but that's what he was.

401
00:36:57.924 --> 00:37:00.894
He had something
that I really value in people,


402
00:37:00.994 --> 00:37:05.532
especially those
of such an artistic level,


403
00:37:05.632 --> 00:37:08.735
which was an interest in others.

404
00:37:08.835 --> 00:37:12.806
Instead of talking
about his films or Hollywood,


405
00:37:12.906 --> 00:37:14.341
which didn't interest him,

406
00:37:14.407 --> 00:37:17.243
he asked you questions about
things like Spanish politics


407
00:37:17.344 --> 00:37:19.612
and the Spanish Civil War.

408
00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:46.673
He wasn't a proud and arrogant
man


409
00:37:47.307 --> 00:37:49.676
or even that sure of himself.

410
00:37:50.043 --> 00:37:53.013
He was a friendly person

411
00:37:54.014 --> 00:37:58.551
and one thing
really stood out for me,


412
00:37:58.618 --> 00:38:01.354
something more important
than somebody's character,


413
00:38:01.421 --> 00:38:04.591
whether they're good or bad,
nasty or nice,


414
00:38:05.191 --> 00:38:07.060
which was his exigency.

415
00:38:07.427 --> 00:38:10.030
The level of exigency

416
00:38:10.764 --> 00:38:14.501
that he imposed on himself

417
00:38:16.136 --> 00:38:20.373
wasn't just a quirk or a hangup,
as many people have said...


418
00:38:20.707 --> 00:38:24.110
"He was a maniac,
he was crazy, he was a pain",


419
00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:25.979
that's all been said about
Kubrick.


420
00:38:26.046 --> 00:38:28.782
He was a maniac,
he was crazy, he was a pain


421
00:38:29.282 --> 00:38:30.817
when it came to quality.

422
00:38:30.884 --> 00:38:36.823
That's one of the things
I admire most in artists.


423
00:41:17.417 --> 00:41:23.489
Legend and Kubrick
go hand in hand together.


424
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:24.891
They used to say...

425
00:41:24.991 --> 00:41:28.828
and when I asked him
he just smiled


426
00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:31.764
as if to say:
"Believe whatever you want",


427
00:41:32.298 --> 00:41:37.503
that he even sent spies
to the big cities


428
00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:41.074
in the countries where his films
were going to be shown


429
00:41:41.674 --> 00:41:47.747
to find out whether the cinema
had the right conditions


430
00:41:47.814 --> 00:41:50.984
so that the creation
that he had filmed,


431
00:41:51.751 --> 00:41:54.187
shot and translated,

432
00:41:54.821 --> 00:41:57.624
with him guiding the
translators,


433
00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:58.891
for so long

434
00:41:59.726 --> 00:42:03.696
was up to the same standards

435
00:42:03.763 --> 00:42:06.099
that he demanded of himself.

436
00:42:09.702 --> 00:42:12.538
In fact, I remember reading

437
00:42:12.605 --> 00:42:15.074
that even for the premier in New
York


438
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:19.412
he demanded a certain size
screen.


439
00:42:19.512 --> 00:42:22.215
If Stanley Kubrick thought

440
00:42:22.315 --> 00:42:26.352
that instead of showing it
at Madrid's Gran Vía


441
00:42:26.419 --> 00:42:27.854
or Lope de Vega cinemas,

442
00:42:27.954 --> 00:42:30.290
it should be shown
at the Carlos III Cinema,


443
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:32.458
a much less important one,

444
00:42:32.525 --> 00:42:35.662
it would premier at the
Carlos III because he said so


445
00:42:35.728 --> 00:42:38.965
and he thought his film
was right for that cinema.


446
00:42:39.065 --> 00:42:43.369
He was capable of refusing
to screen one of his films


447
00:42:43.469 --> 00:42:47.974
because the colour of the room
didn't go well enough


448
00:42:48.074 --> 00:42:50.610
with the colours in the film

449
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.046
so he wouldn't let it go ahead.

450
00:42:53.146 --> 00:42:57.550
He had full control over the
exploitation of his film.


451
00:42:57.617 --> 00:43:00.253
He wanted to control everything

452
00:43:00.353 --> 00:43:02.922
from production
and management to exhibition,


453
00:43:03.022 --> 00:43:04.724
which the big majors do
nowadays.


454
00:43:06.592 --> 00:43:08.928
Warner Bros. were very
interested


455
00:43:09.028 --> 00:43:12.699
in showing the film in
Valladolid


456
00:43:12.765 --> 00:43:15.668
which would open the doors

457
00:43:15.735 --> 00:43:20.673
for the possible normal commercial
distribution of the film.


458
00:43:21.107 --> 00:43:25.311
They called me and said:
"We're going to work on Kubrick


459
00:43:25.378 --> 00:43:27.513
and try to get his permission".

460
00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:35.188
Warner Bros.
Sent one of their managers,


461
00:43:35.254 --> 00:43:38.091
Angel Corbi, to London

462
00:43:38.191 --> 00:43:43.463
to convince Kubrick to authorise

463
00:43:43.529 --> 00:43:46.666
the screening
of the film in Valladolid.


464
00:43:48.468 --> 00:43:51.904
He came to see me
when he got back


465
00:43:51.971 --> 00:43:54.340
and told me to write him a
letter


466
00:43:54.407 --> 00:43:58.911
saying that the film
would be screened


467
00:43:58.978 --> 00:44:01.013
at the University of Valladolid.

468
00:44:01.948 --> 00:44:04.083
He thought that telling him

469
00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:08.087
that the film
would be shown exclusively


470
00:44:08.187 --> 00:44:10.690
at the University

471
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:14.093
might convince him
to give his permission.


472
00:44:14.994 --> 00:44:18.531
It was our only chance
and we had to give it a go.


473
00:44:21.267 --> 00:44:23.369
I wrote a letter explaining

474
00:44:23.936 --> 00:44:28.808
about the festival's
personality,


475
00:44:28.908 --> 00:44:31.010
what our approach was,

476
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.646
that it was progressive

477
00:44:33.746 --> 00:44:37.183
and the film would be screened

478
00:44:37.817 --> 00:44:39.252
for the university.

479
00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.624
That's how we got Kubrick
to give us his permission.


480
00:45:22.295 --> 00:45:26.232
That the festival management,

481
00:45:26.299 --> 00:45:28.634
Romero with his letter

482
00:45:29.035 --> 00:45:31.904
and the representative
from Warner Bros. Spain,


483
00:45:31.971 --> 00:45:37.376
did something all too common
among epic Spanish characters,


484
00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:41.347
who use every trick in the book

485
00:45:41.414 --> 00:45:43.616
to make things happen that,

486
00:45:44.884 --> 00:45:47.820
seen from any other angle,
are absolutely impossible.


487
00:45:47.887 --> 00:45:51.023
Although I'd said that the film

488
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.392
was going to be shown
at the university,


489
00:45:53.993 --> 00:45:56.896
I didn't really trick him

490
00:45:56.963 --> 00:46:02.702
because the audience
that watched it in the Carrión


491
00:46:03.269 --> 00:46:06.873
was exclusively from the
university.


492
00:46:06.939 --> 00:46:09.909
The university world was fired
up,


493
00:46:09.976 --> 00:46:12.712
coming off the back
of an exceptional situation.


494
00:46:13.145 --> 00:46:15.414
The fact that a film was being
shown


495
00:46:15.515 --> 00:46:18.684
that had been banned
and censored for four years


496
00:46:18.784 --> 00:46:20.353
since its release

497
00:46:20.753 --> 00:46:25.625
made the university students

498
00:46:25.691 --> 00:46:29.295
lose control,

499
00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:32.865
it was a reward,
a cultural uprising.


500
00:46:34.367 --> 00:46:35.501
You had to go!

501
00:46:50.683 --> 00:46:54.854
'A Clockwork Orange'
was such an attraction,


502
00:46:54.954 --> 00:46:57.189
an unhealthy one, you might say,

503
00:46:57.723 --> 00:47:01.193
and people queued
as far as the eye could see.


504
00:47:03.029 --> 00:47:06.933
I remember the cinema
surrounded by people waiting.


505
00:47:07.033 --> 00:47:09.268
I was in that queue

506
00:47:09.335 --> 00:47:11.470
and people even
brought sleeping bags.


507
00:47:11.537 --> 00:47:14.807
Some people slept out there
all night.


508
00:47:14.907 --> 00:47:17.209
They were taking it in turns.

509
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.612
Two hours each and then switch.

510
00:47:19.712 --> 00:47:23.282
I remember at one point
the Police went by,


511
00:47:23.382 --> 00:47:25.017
maybe somebody said something,

512
00:47:25.084 --> 00:47:27.486
and then charged

513
00:47:27.587 --> 00:47:29.021
scattering the queue

514
00:47:29.088 --> 00:47:31.057
only for it to reform later on.

515
00:47:31.123 --> 00:47:35.661
And the next day they rushed in

516
00:47:35.728 --> 00:47:40.366
as if they'd been tied down,
everyone running to get there first.


517
00:47:43.302 --> 00:47:47.173
When the tickets
were supposed to go on sale,


518
00:47:47.873 --> 00:47:51.110
they called me
and said there was a problem,


519
00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:54.213
there were no tickets
left at the Carrión.


520
00:47:55.047 --> 00:47:58.451
"No tickets? But they're
not even on sale yet."


521
00:47:58.551 --> 00:48:03.189
"Yes, but there are no tickets
for 'A Clockwork Orange'."


522
00:48:03.823 --> 00:48:08.227
We went straight over.

523
00:48:08.294 --> 00:48:13.366
When we saw the queue,
Carmelo and I got a shock.


524
00:48:13.466 --> 00:48:15.835
We thought:
"This is going to get messy."


525
00:48:17.403 --> 00:48:19.772
We asked the ticket operator
what was wrong.


526
00:48:19.872 --> 00:48:23.609
"Sir, the owner of the cinema,"

527
00:48:23.709 --> 00:48:28.314
has given all of the tickets
for 'A Clockwork Orange'


528
00:48:28.381 --> 00:48:32.051
to their friends, contacts, etc.

529
00:48:32.151 --> 00:48:34.487
"And there are none left."

530
00:48:34.587 --> 00:48:38.591
None of the people waiting
outside


531
00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:41.627
could get in
because there were no tickets.


532
00:48:41.927 --> 00:48:43.329
"What do you mean?"

533
00:48:43.429 --> 00:48:45.731
What am I going to do
with all of these people


534
00:48:45.831 --> 00:48:48.668
who have been queueing
for over 24 hours


535
00:48:48.734 --> 00:48:51.737
"waiting to see the film?"

536
00:48:51.804 --> 00:48:53.873
"I don't know,
there are no tickets."


537
00:48:53.939 --> 00:48:58.110
They cancelled the tickets that
had been assigned beforehand.


538
00:48:58.444 --> 00:49:00.246
They brought out some new
tickets,


539
00:49:00.346 --> 00:49:03.382
gave them
to the ticket operator and said:


540
00:49:03.449 --> 00:49:05.951
"Use these ones".

541
00:49:06.686 --> 00:49:11.991
The poor woman looked like
she'd just seen a ghost.


542
00:49:12.058 --> 00:49:15.895
He had given one thousand
tickets


543
00:49:16.328 --> 00:49:20.533
to all the people
who wanted to see the film


544
00:49:20.633 --> 00:49:22.034
and hadn't queued.

545
00:49:22.101 --> 00:49:26.272
It had a big impact
but it was well organised


546
00:49:26.338 --> 00:49:27.773
and sorted out properly.

547
00:49:27.873 --> 00:49:32.111
The tickets sold out
immediately.


548
00:49:32.178 --> 00:49:36.549
The only inconvenience, besides
spending the night outside,


549
00:49:36.982 --> 00:49:39.652
was that lots of people in the
queue


550
00:49:40.052 --> 00:49:44.790
were planning to buy ten or
twelve tickets for their friends


551
00:49:45.324 --> 00:49:48.627
but were met
with the unpleasant surprise


552
00:49:48.694 --> 00:49:53.365
that the organisers were only
selling two tickets per person.


553
00:49:53.466 --> 00:49:57.570
So the friend that got to the
front was only given two tickets


554
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:59.105
to share with everyone...

555
00:50:00.172 --> 00:50:02.508
it was a big disappointment.

556
00:50:03.075 --> 00:50:07.012
We were such good friends that
we drew straws for the tickets


557
00:50:07.913 --> 00:50:10.583
and my husband and I
ended up with them


558
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:12.685
so we went to see it

559
00:50:12.785 --> 00:50:15.087
and our expectations were very
high.


560
00:50:19.058 --> 00:50:21.927
There was an organised way
to pick up the tickets


561
00:50:22.027 --> 00:50:24.730
and enter the cinema
in an orderly fashion.


562
00:50:25.498 --> 00:50:27.767
My role at the cinema

563
00:50:27.867 --> 00:50:32.805
was to make sure nothing went
wrong during the screening.


564
00:50:32.905 --> 00:50:36.442
The city was divided:
those who were excited


565
00:50:36.542 --> 00:50:39.178
and those who sat at the front
saying the rosary,


566
00:50:39.245 --> 00:50:40.713
they couldn't believe it.

567
00:50:41.147 --> 00:50:43.048
Peace wasn't guaranteed.

568
00:50:43.149 --> 00:50:47.853
The previous year a film
by Carlos Saura had been shown,


569
00:50:47.953 --> 00:50:49.355
'Cousin Angelica'.

570
00:50:49.421 --> 00:50:53.459
I went to see it in Gijón
and they stopped the film


571
00:50:53.526 --> 00:50:58.497
because Falange,
very right-wing people


572
00:50:58.831 --> 00:51:01.467
didn't like how they were
portrayed.


573
00:51:01.534 --> 00:51:06.071
The Police had their eye on it.

574
00:51:06.138 --> 00:51:12.111
There was a small group of
anti-riot police in the cinema.


575
00:51:12.178 --> 00:51:14.446
They were keeping an eye
on what was going on.


576
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:21.787
I decided to go up
to the projection booth


577
00:51:22.621 --> 00:51:26.492
to make sure that nothing went
wrong


578
00:51:26.592 --> 00:51:29.094
and that everything
was running smoothly.


579
00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.036
I watched it from up here,
from where we're filming.


580
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:39.505
It was full to the rafters.

581
00:51:39.572 --> 00:51:42.575
Everyone was absolutely silent,
there wasn't a sound.


582
00:51:42.675 --> 00:51:44.643
Silent and excited

583
00:51:44.743 --> 00:51:47.980
to see what we'd waited
all night for,


584
00:51:48.047 --> 00:51:51.450
what it was like,
we didn't want to miss a thing.


585
00:52:20.913 --> 00:52:23.515
Half way through the film,

586
00:52:24.116 --> 00:52:26.585
the Police rang me

587
00:52:26.652 --> 00:52:29.455
to say there was a bomb
in the cinema.


588
00:52:30.689 --> 00:52:31.790
Oh my God...

589
00:52:32.324 --> 00:52:35.728
Back then, bomb alerts

590
00:52:36.128 --> 00:52:39.298
were relatively common

591
00:52:39.665 --> 00:52:45.304
at cultural and problematic
events.


592
00:52:46.305 --> 00:52:49.008
Calling up and saying:

593
00:52:49.108 --> 00:52:52.211
"Hey, there's a bomb
in such a such place"


594
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:55.614
meant the activity would be
stopped


595
00:52:55.714 --> 00:53:00.452
and implied no risk
for the person who called it in.


596
00:53:01.487 --> 00:53:04.189
I decided to take a chance
and I told him:


597
00:53:04.256 --> 00:53:06.926
"Look, sir, I'm sorry"

598
00:53:07.026 --> 00:53:11.764
but I'll be held responsible
for not stopping the screening.


599
00:53:12.564 --> 00:53:14.733
We're half way through,

600
00:53:14.833 --> 00:53:16.936
and after everything that's
happened,


601
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:21.507
"we'll see it through to the
end."


602
00:53:31.016 --> 00:53:32.551
I was impressed by the film.

603
00:53:35.187 --> 00:53:36.755
It was visually striking.

604
00:53:37.389 --> 00:53:41.293
The whole set design is incredible.
It's brutalist.


605
00:53:43.095 --> 00:53:45.531
The setting is so modern.

606
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:46.665
The colours,

607
00:53:47.499 --> 00:53:48.701
the clothes...

608
00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:53.706
Pop iconography was so
interesting to us back then.


609
00:53:54.707 --> 00:53:56.809
I thought
it was absolutely fantastic,


610
00:53:56.909 --> 00:53:59.511
very clever, very well done,
very well performed.


611
00:53:59.578 --> 00:54:03.449
Malcolm McDowell with that
evil face and that eye...


612
00:55:19.858 --> 00:55:23.495
It's also striking
the way they try to cure him.


613
00:55:27.833 --> 00:55:31.336
With his eyes held open

614
00:55:31.403 --> 00:55:36.708
to make him watch the scenes
of violence and everything...


615
00:56:48.313 --> 00:56:50.215
I remember that the music...

616
00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:55.954
perfectly matched
the scenes of violence.


617
00:57:14.139 --> 00:57:15.574
It made me feel quite ill,

618
00:57:15.674 --> 00:57:18.443
I'd never seen violence like it.

619
00:57:20.712 --> 00:57:24.616
There were some scenes
that I couldn't even watch


620
00:57:24.683 --> 00:57:26.652
because they were too
disturbing.


621
00:57:33.692 --> 00:57:38.030
I started to feel like throwing
up,


622
00:57:38.096 --> 00:57:39.665
I didn't know what to do...

623
00:57:45.404 --> 00:57:47.005
To be honest,

624
00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:52.044
I was surprised
at how well-thought-out it was,


625
00:57:52.144 --> 00:57:57.516
even with that
constant injection of violence.


626
00:58:07.893 --> 00:58:12.898
It explains the whole
phenomenon of domination


627
00:58:12.965 --> 00:58:15.968
between people,
castes and classes,


628
00:58:16.068 --> 00:58:17.669
and the State's domination of
people.


629
00:58:44.196 --> 00:58:46.365
It was about a type of violence

630
00:58:46.465 --> 00:58:50.035
that we saw in the streets
quite often.


631
00:58:52.571 --> 00:58:56.008
In Valladolid,
we had friends in prison...


632
00:58:59.511 --> 00:59:01.179
and a friend who had been thrown

633
00:59:01.246 --> 00:59:03.849
from the window
of the Police station.


634
00:59:06.184 --> 00:59:10.622
That was what we saw
from 1971 or 1972


635
00:59:10.689 --> 00:59:13.825
up until the vote
for the constitution.


636
00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:39.985
It was a very disturbing film,

637
00:59:40.052 --> 00:59:43.388
one that doesn't leave you
indifferent.


638
00:59:43.455 --> 00:59:46.458
It caused a commotion,

639
00:59:46.525 --> 00:59:49.027
it's one of the films
that made the most noise.


640
00:59:49.094 --> 00:59:51.963
The film? What can I say?
I didn't like it.


641
00:59:52.064 --> 00:59:54.032
It was very unpleasant...

642
00:59:54.733 --> 00:59:56.635
but it's a great film.

643
00:59:56.702 --> 01:00:00.272
It's astonishing

644
01:00:00.339 --> 01:00:03.308
because of how it's made

645
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:05.777
and the genius behind it.

646
01:00:05.844 --> 01:00:07.212
I absolutely loved it.

647
01:00:07.579 --> 01:00:11.616
I don't know if I should say this...
but I found it really funny.


648
01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:15.854
I really enjoyed myself
and the end is great.


649
01:00:24.363 --> 01:00:27.699
When the screening was over
everyone started clapping


650
01:00:27.766 --> 01:00:33.338
but nothing untoward happened.

651
01:00:33.405 --> 01:00:37.008
People were amazed by the film,

652
01:00:37.743 --> 01:00:41.413
in awe of Kubrick's directing,

653
01:00:41.813 --> 01:00:45.417
how powerful the film was,
but that was all.


654
01:00:45.984 --> 01:00:49.187
Back then, it was trendy
to have a film forum.


655
01:00:49.654 --> 01:00:54.726
When we saw
a Woody Allen or Buñuel film


656
01:00:54.826 --> 01:00:58.363
we always commented
and reflected on it,


657
01:00:58.463 --> 01:01:01.333
something that could go on for
days


658
01:01:01.433 --> 01:01:03.502
when you met up with your
friends.


659
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:09.274
This film didn't give rise
to that kind of film forum.


660
01:01:09.674 --> 01:01:12.444
This may seem absurd...

661
01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:15.113
Afterwards,
they seemed almost frustrated.


662
01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:19.284
I don't know what they
were expecting to see...


663
01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.253
One thing we mustn't forget

664
01:01:21.353 --> 01:01:24.289
is the mark
that censorship leaves


665
01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:26.425
on a cultural product.

666
01:01:26.491 --> 01:01:30.429
It created certain expectations
and a special interest


667
01:01:30.495 --> 01:01:35.534
regardless of whether they ended
up watching a masterpiece or not.


668
01:01:35.634 --> 01:01:38.603
It's like when
you're getting ready for a trip


669
01:01:38.703 --> 01:01:42.741
and you enjoy the planning
more than the trip itself.


670
01:01:42.808 --> 01:01:46.578
I think I've seen films
that I like more


671
01:01:46.645 --> 01:01:50.649
in terms of the plot and content

672
01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:52.784
but I'll never forget that film.

673
01:01:52.851 --> 01:01:56.188
It's a really important film
that marked a before and after


674
01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:59.658
in the behaviour
of viewers and critics


675
01:01:59.724 --> 01:02:01.893
and the people
from Valladolid in general.


676
01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:06.431
And that's the story of the film
at the Valladolid festival.


677
01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:20.212
The festival was elevated

678
01:02:20.312 --> 01:02:22.380
by the screening
of 'A Clockwork Orange'


679
01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:25.817
but some films
didn't cause such a hype...


680
01:02:25.884 --> 01:02:28.653
For example, the first film
by Steven Spielberg


681
01:02:28.753 --> 01:02:30.489
that was shown at the festival.

682
01:03:36.888 --> 01:03:41.026
A few months later, the film
was authorised for screening


683
01:03:41.092 --> 01:03:45.330
in art-house cinemas.

684
01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:49.434
It was shown
in the Cid Campeador in Madrid.


685
01:03:50.802 --> 01:03:56.675
But we had to wait two more years
for the commercial dubbed version.


686
01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:03.048
Of all the film translation
projects that I've done,


687
01:04:03.448 --> 01:04:05.650
it was definitely the most
difficult.


688
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:08.353
The film was shot
in a made-up language.


689
01:04:13.592 --> 01:04:16.394
Burgess, the novelist, said:
"I'm going to do it


690
01:04:16.461 --> 01:04:18.496
in a language that's all mixed
up."


691
01:04:18.964 --> 01:04:23.702
He blended the Queen's English with
some contemporary English slang


692
01:04:23.768 --> 01:04:26.905
and also some Russian

693
01:04:26.972 --> 01:04:29.808
inspired by
what he heard being spoken


694
01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:34.646
by a group of dandies
from Saint Petersburg.


695
01:04:36.381 --> 01:04:41.186
The head,
in the original novel and film,


696
01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:42.587
is called the "Gulliver"...

697
01:04:44.689 --> 01:04:47.459
It's taken from that famous
novel,


698
01:04:47.525 --> 01:04:48.793
Gulliver's Travels.

699
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:55.066
I translated it as the
"quijotera".


700
01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:00.472
I did the translation,

701
01:05:00.538 --> 01:05:05.243
Saura, with Kubrick's guidelines
that he sent from London,


702
01:05:05.744 --> 01:05:07.178
did the dubbing

703
01:05:07.245 --> 01:05:09.648
and the film was released,

704
01:05:09.748 --> 01:05:13.752
as I like to joke, "openly",

705
01:05:13.818 --> 01:05:17.022
not just for select
audiences like before.


706
01:05:17.088 --> 01:05:21.226
'A Clockwork Orange' was one of
the biggest phenomena in Spain,


707
01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:23.828
on a par with Star Wars.

708
01:05:23.895 --> 01:05:25.330
It was shown for a year.

709
01:05:34.739 --> 01:05:37.075
FRANCO IS DEAD

710
01:06:56.821 --> 01:07:01.192
Valladolid is a city with a
certain amount of conservatism


711
01:07:01.259 --> 01:07:02.660
and a cultural effervescence

712
01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:04.863
that was already around in the

713
01:07:04.929 --> 01:07:08.233
with Seminci and the screening
of 'A Clockwork Orange'


714
01:07:08.299 --> 01:07:11.302
which people still remember
and talk about.


715
01:07:11.369 --> 01:07:16.174
I think it still has
a big impact on the city.


716
01:07:16.274 --> 01:07:18.810
I grew up with that legend.

717
01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:24.783
It's always difficult to know
what's true and what's not.


718
01:07:24.849 --> 01:07:27.752
I think it's best
to just believe the legend.


719
01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:32.657
It's mainly the young people
who don't know


720
01:07:32.724 --> 01:07:34.392
about the screening

721
01:07:34.459 --> 01:07:38.062
because they're disconnected
from classical cinema.


722
01:07:38.129 --> 01:07:40.865
From my experience as a teacher,

723
01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:43.301
I'm pretty sure that the
majority of new generations


724
01:07:43.368 --> 01:07:44.936
haven't even seen it.

725
01:07:46.404 --> 01:07:48.773
No, I haven't seen it.

726
01:07:48.873 --> 01:07:51.743
I've never heard of 'A
Clockwork Orange' or Kubrick.


727
01:07:51.810 --> 01:07:55.613
It rings a bell. I've heard
of the title, but that's it.


728
01:07:55.713 --> 01:07:57.115
I know nothing about it.

729
01:07:57.182 --> 01:08:01.619
I know it was revolutionary
in its time, but that's all.


730
01:08:01.686 --> 01:08:03.421
I've heard
it's uncomfortable to watch


731
01:08:03.488 --> 01:08:05.990
but I don't know what it's
about.


732
01:08:06.057 --> 01:08:07.525
You recognise the iconography.

733
01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:10.929
You know it's from the film
even if you haven't seen it.


734
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:14.032
It's still
an aesthetically powerful film.


735
01:08:14.098 --> 01:08:15.233
It's become an icon.

736
01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.368
At Halloween,
people dress up as droogs...


737
01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:19.671
The hats...

738
01:08:19.737 --> 01:08:22.373
It's part of pop culture.

739
01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:25.577
It means that
they recognise some images


740
01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:28.546
like with other films but it
doesn't mean they've seen it.


741
01:08:28.613 --> 01:08:30.181
No, I haven't seen it.

742
01:08:30.248 --> 01:08:32.483
The aesthetics,
an episode of 'The Simpsons'...


743
01:08:32.584 --> 01:08:35.653
An episode of 'The
Simpsons' or other series.


744
01:08:35.753 --> 01:08:38.656
And they don't know the plot
or what it's about...


745
01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:42.527
The only thing I know about
'A Clockwork Orange' are memes


746
01:08:42.627 --> 01:08:44.963
or jokes I've seen on the
Internet.


747
01:08:45.063 --> 01:08:47.365
I'm sure the film
still has the ability


748
01:08:47.465 --> 01:08:50.902
to awaken people's consciences
and churn their stomachs.


749
01:08:51.569 --> 01:08:54.072
It depends on how sensitive they
are.


750
01:09:03.748 --> 01:09:06.017
I think the way it started

751
01:09:06.084 --> 01:09:09.254
got you hooked and you
wanted to watch the rest.


752
01:09:10.255 --> 01:09:13.391
At the beginning,
the drunk guy they beat up


753
01:09:13.458 --> 01:09:15.994
says he doesn't want
to live in a lawless world.


754
01:09:17.328 --> 01:09:20.732
I was shocked when they were
in the tunnel beating him up.


755
01:09:21.833 --> 01:09:26.070
When they rape the woman in the
house and the man's watching.


756
01:09:27.672 --> 01:09:30.174
When they hit each other.

757
01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:37.015
As well as the scenes
of explicit violence,


758
01:09:37.115 --> 01:09:40.218
it's quite shocking
when they force his eyes open.


759
01:09:40.752 --> 01:09:42.086
Institutional violence

760
01:09:42.186 --> 01:09:44.656
and how the system
takes that violence and uses it.


761
01:09:46.257 --> 01:09:51.496
The influence of the media
on society stood out for me.


762
01:09:51.596 --> 01:09:53.331
Some of the scenes are shocking

763
01:09:53.431 --> 01:09:55.366
and I'm not sure
what people must've thought


764
01:09:55.466 --> 01:09:56.701
when it first came out.

765
01:09:57.669 --> 01:10:00.371
Right from the very first scene,

766
01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:03.408
with four men
forcing themselves on a woman...


767
01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:06.044
and not just that one,
a couple more...


768
01:10:06.144 --> 01:10:10.982
I found them pretty shocking
because they're really explicit


769
01:10:11.049 --> 01:10:16.387
for a film
that was screened at a festival


770
01:10:16.454 --> 01:10:20.091
and is recognised as a cult
film.


771
01:10:20.191 --> 01:10:23.661
I found it difficult to watch
and quite savage,


772
01:10:23.728 --> 01:10:26.464
but I liked it overall.

773
01:10:26.531 --> 01:10:27.932
I liked the film.

774
01:10:28.032 --> 01:10:29.634
I really liked the film.

775
01:10:29.701 --> 01:10:30.835
I loved it.

776
01:10:30.902 --> 01:10:34.772
I liked it but I feel
a little unsettled.


777
01:10:34.872 --> 01:10:38.910
It would be impossible for this
to be released nowadays.


778
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:42.513
People would be up in arms.

779
01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:44.615
It would be risky to make it now

780
01:10:44.716 --> 01:10:48.186
because I think it's
controversial


781
01:10:48.252 --> 01:10:49.821
and very explicit.

782
01:10:49.887 --> 01:10:51.756
It was too much for me.

783
01:10:51.823 --> 01:10:53.791
The sexual stuff...

784
01:10:53.858 --> 01:10:57.628
I don't think it would be received
the same way now as it was then.


785
01:10:57.695 --> 01:11:01.366
No, you couldn't make
this film now because...


786
01:11:02.767 --> 01:11:05.770
no director could...

787
01:11:06.704 --> 01:11:09.874
get enough support to make it,
and even if they did


788
01:11:11.509 --> 01:11:14.912
no producer would approve it.

789
01:11:31.029 --> 01:11:34.966
Maybe the film
couldn't be made today


790
01:11:35.066 --> 01:11:39.370
mainly because the producers

791
01:11:40.304 --> 01:11:42.273
wouldn't deem it appropriate.

792
01:11:43.741 --> 01:11:46.778
We sometimes automatically apply

793
01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:50.448
certain scales of behaviour

794
01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:55.953
and, in real life,

795
01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:58.990
we have to be very strict

796
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:02.627
and recognise there are
some things we can't do


797
01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.028
and shouldn't do,

798
01:12:04.095 --> 01:12:06.864
but it's another thing for me
to envisage a book


799
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:10.935
with a violent scene
that might upset somebody...


800
01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.670
Just because it upsets somebody

801
01:12:12.737 --> 01:12:15.506
doesn't mean
that work must disappear.


802
01:12:15.573 --> 01:12:17.341
Wrongness isn't erased

803
01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:22.780
by removing the reflection
of something that's wrong


804
01:12:23.414 --> 01:12:27.385
from a beautiful film or book.

805
01:12:31.856 --> 01:12:33.691
Having been through it myself

806
01:12:33.791 --> 01:12:38.062
but also having had time
to reflect on it,


807
01:12:38.129 --> 01:12:41.165
I despise the existence
of censorship.


808
01:12:41.532 --> 01:12:45.670
That censorship was much more
severe,


809
01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.905
tougher and more aggressive

810
01:12:48.473 --> 01:12:52.009
but much less subtle

811
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:57.381
than it would be to today accept
a censorship on traditions,


812
01:12:57.448 --> 01:12:58.716
on habits,

813
01:12:58.783 --> 01:13:02.220
on what's politically correct
or incorrect,


814
01:13:02.286 --> 01:13:04.789
on what's commercial and what's
not.


815
01:13:04.856 --> 01:13:09.393
With any cultural
or artistic activity,


816
01:13:09.861 --> 01:13:15.066
the creator's need for freedom
is fundamental.
