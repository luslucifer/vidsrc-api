00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:02.439
THIS IS MY DESIRE

2
00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.389
Come in, factory. Come in.

3
00:01:37.725 --> 00:01:38.767
<i>I read you.</i>

4
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:41.687
Try the roller.

5
00:01:45.107 --> 00:01:46.608
<i>It's working.</i>

6
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.195
<i>It's working. 
I said it's working.</i>

7
00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:51.321
Okay.

8
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:29.610
<i>They earn more than
the senators in the US.</i>


9
00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.323
<i>In fact, Nigerian senators earn more
than the US president.</i>


10
00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:38.577
<i>They think we are fools.</i>

11
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.955
<i>So it's up to Nigerians.
I'm not talking about reform.</i>


12
00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.416
<i>I'm talking about revolution.</i>

13
00:03:03.268 --> 00:03:04.436
What is it?

14
00:03:04.937 --> 00:03:07.523
Madam, the junction boxes, all of them -

15
00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:09.024
They're unmanageable.

16
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.235
What do you mean by that?

17
00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:14.112
Madam, they're all broken.

18
00:03:18.951 --> 00:03:20.369
I'll see what I can do.

19
00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:22.830
Thank you, madam. Thank you.

20
00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:45.477
You've broken it.

21
00:03:46.186 --> 00:03:48.105
Get his file.

22
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:03.453
I'm telling you, the passport is real.

23
00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:06.498
So when you're ready
to apply for the visa, you can come.


24
00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:08.584
Thank you.

25
00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:16.485
Tighter, tighter. 
Yeah, that's right.

26
00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:19.571
Here, give me.

27
00:05:19.655 --> 00:05:21.907
Uncle? They broke my paddle.

28
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.784
- Again?
- Yes.


29
00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:26.161
- All right. Leave it upstairs.
- Okay.


30
00:05:29.164 --> 00:05:30.666
You want to turn it on?

31
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:50.394
- Hello, Mommy.
- How are you?


32
00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:55.607
Did you get it?

33
00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:13.083
All that's left is the visa.

34
00:06:14.334 --> 00:06:16.545
I'll transfer the money
to your account tomorrow.


35
00:06:16.628 --> 00:06:17.754
Thank you.

36
00:06:17.838 --> 00:06:20.841
- Come on! I'm still looking at it.
- Give it back.


37
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.845
You're going overseas.
I can't believe it.


38
00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:27.764
All right. I'm heading in.

39
00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:34.438
- Money?
- Yes.


40
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.606
When they fight, they get money.

41
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.361
Especially if they win a title.

42
00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:43.947
How much?

43
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:45.490
Up to a million.

44
00:06:45.574 --> 00:06:48.201
A million?! Naira?

45
00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:53.665
In a fight,
you can get up to one million.


46
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.670
Don't forget to buy <i>Assurance.</i>

47
00:06:58.754 --> 00:07:00.630
- Which season?
- Nine.


48
00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:02.799
Will that show ever end?

49
00:07:09.222 --> 00:07:10.724
What about you boys?

50
00:07:10.807 --> 00:07:12.851
But he still beat Shawn Michaels.

51
00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:14.728
Answer your uncle.

52
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:16.605
I already know what you want.

53
00:07:17.814 --> 00:07:19.232
Celestine?

54
00:07:21.443 --> 00:07:23.695
Your uncle is talking to you, Celestine.

55
00:07:27.991 --> 00:07:29.701
Bring your paddle.

56
00:07:41.797 --> 00:07:44.132
My spoon is not a screwdriver!

57
00:07:58.647 --> 00:08:01.274
Goddey! Goddey!

58
00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:07.989
I don't know what these kids
have done to my TV.


59
00:08:08.865 --> 00:08:11.368
I just want to come home
and watch my show.


60
00:08:12.077 --> 00:08:15.705
I've told them not to touch my TV.

61
00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:20.085
What are you doing?

62
00:08:24.047 --> 00:08:26.633
Mofe, talk to me.

63
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.845
Oh! It's working now.

64
00:08:31.304 --> 00:08:32.597
Thank you.

65
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:33.974
You see?

66
00:08:34.057 --> 00:08:37.394
I don't want them touching my TV.

67
00:08:45.569 --> 00:08:48.446
They told her not to marry him!

68
00:08:52.492 --> 00:08:54.327
She's in trouble now.

69
00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:25.984
It looks real to me.

70
00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:28.737
Yeah, it's real.

71
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.238
What are you guys doing?

72
00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:34.242
Let me see.

73
00:09:39.915 --> 00:09:43.043
You? Sanchez?

74
00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:45.253
Is that the name your parents gave you?

75
00:09:45.754 --> 00:09:47.214
It's my foreign name.

76
00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:50.008
Your foreign name?

77
00:09:50.634 --> 00:09:54.429
All right. Get back to your posts.

78
00:09:55.931 --> 00:09:57.015
Sanchez...

79
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.123
I don't know why you guys
are wasting fuel...


80
00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:07.335
like I have the money.

81
00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:21.891
Goddey!

82
00:12:35.965 --> 00:12:37.717
Give me the Oju Adewale file.

83
00:13:47.454 --> 00:13:48.621
Mofe?

84
00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:53.376
The mortuary guys are here.

85
00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:00.592
- Morgue!
- Sir.


86
00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:01.885
Come, come, come.

87
00:14:25.283 --> 00:14:26.784
When can I take the bodies?

88
00:14:27.368 --> 00:14:29.454
As soon as we receive the discharge fee.

89
00:14:31.414 --> 00:14:32.624
What do you mean?

90
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.252
Discharge fee. See? It's here.

91
00:14:40.089 --> 00:14:41.341
What if he can't pay?

92
00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:44.219
We'll dispose of them.

93
00:14:45.762 --> 00:14:47.138
What are you saying?

94
00:14:47.972 --> 00:14:49.807
It's not right.

95
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:50.892
Sir, please.

96
00:14:50.975 --> 00:14:53.770
Is next week okay?

97
00:14:53.853 --> 00:14:57.190
You can pay whenever you want.
Just know that it is 3,000 per day.


98
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:01.486
What kind of cruelty is this?

99
00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:02.779
Abu, it's okay.

100
00:15:04.197 --> 00:15:07.825
Mofe, it's not okay. 
It's not right.

101
00:15:09.118 --> 00:15:12.413
Look, madam, if it were your own kids,
would you stand for it?


102
00:15:12.497 --> 00:15:13.498
Sir -

103
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:15.708
Please, I don't like how
you're talking to me.


104
00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:17.210
Mind how you're talking to me.

105
00:15:17.293 --> 00:15:19.587
- Why did you touch me?
- Abu, leave it.


106
00:15:20.213 --> 00:15:21.381
Are you okay?

107
00:15:42.694 --> 00:15:43.987
Hello, Auntie.

108
00:15:45.113 --> 00:15:46.322
Fine, thank you.

109
00:15:49.325 --> 00:15:50.743
Is Papa with you?

110
00:15:58.751 --> 00:16:00.128
Good evening, Papa.

111
00:16:01.713 --> 00:16:02.755
I'm fine.

112
00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:07.719
Papa, I'm calling because...

113
00:16:10.305 --> 00:16:12.432
I'm calling because Precious...

114
00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:18.229
Papa,

115
00:16:18.896 --> 00:16:20.315
Precious is dead.

116
00:16:23.318 --> 00:16:24.569
And the children.

117
00:16:26.487 --> 00:16:27.488
Accident.

118
00:16:28.573 --> 00:16:29.782
No, in the house.

119
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.331
I don't know.
Something to do with the generator.


120
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:37.957
I don't know.

121
00:16:40.209 --> 00:16:41.294
Yes.

122
00:16:43.254 --> 00:16:45.757
I'm bringing them home next week.

123
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.801
I said next week.

124
00:16:50.345 --> 00:16:51.387
Yes.

125
00:16:55.642 --> 00:16:56.684
Bye.

126
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.140
- This is Wisdom.
- Wisdom.


127
00:17:42.939 --> 00:17:44.273
This is Wisdom.

128
00:17:49.153 --> 00:17:51.531
This is the new electrician, Wisdom.

129
00:17:56.911 --> 00:18:01.082
Don't touch these machines.

130
00:18:02.458 --> 00:18:04.669
They need to be repaired.

131
00:18:05.253 --> 00:18:06.671
They're very dangerous.

132
00:18:09.048 --> 00:18:12.677
So you see?
This is what we are running.


133
00:18:17.181 --> 00:18:18.725
This is for the roller.

134
00:18:18.808 --> 00:18:21.227
See how it's connected to the main cable?

135
00:18:22.061 --> 00:18:24.689
When the roller comes,
you won't fix it.


136
00:18:25.314 --> 00:18:28.985
If the machine stops working,
cut the wire here...


137
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:35.032
and connect it here.

138
00:18:37.952 --> 00:18:38.953
You understand?

139
00:18:40.913 --> 00:18:42.582
Okay. Show me.

140
00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:48.755
Not that one.

141
00:18:57.847 --> 00:19:00.349
Yes, that's good. That's it.

142
00:21:09.729 --> 00:21:11.856
Blessing will bring your drink
in a second.


143
00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:13.149
Thank you, Auntie.

144
00:21:14.108 --> 00:21:16.277
You know he finished
at the top of his class.


145
00:21:17.737 --> 00:21:18.779
Well done.

146
00:21:19.739 --> 00:21:22.825
And he's going to university next year.

147
00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.750
So, Papa...

148
00:21:32.835 --> 00:21:36.130
I'm going to Okpara's tomorrow.

149
00:21:37.673 --> 00:21:39.300
Is that where they are?

150
00:21:40.426 --> 00:21:41.510
Yes.

151
00:21:42.094 --> 00:21:44.805
- And you're going there tomorrow?
- Yes.


152
00:21:44.889 --> 00:21:47.642
All right, all right.

153
00:21:50.186 --> 00:21:52.772
Is there anything you want to contribute?

154
00:21:54.732 --> 00:21:56.317
Was she not my daughter?

155
00:21:59.278 --> 00:22:00.404
Anyone home?

156
00:22:00.488 --> 00:22:03.240
- Ah, Clarence!
- Welcome.


157
00:22:03.741 --> 00:22:05.451
Good afternoon.

158
00:22:05.534 --> 00:22:07.536
Hello.

159
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.538
Have a seat.

160
00:22:16.712 --> 00:22:19.465
Clarence, this is my son.

161
00:22:22.927 --> 00:22:24.011
Mofe.

162
00:22:24.095 --> 00:22:27.515
Yeah, Mofe! How are you?

163
00:22:28.349 --> 00:22:29.725
It's been a while.

164
00:22:34.313 --> 00:22:36.148
I'm Uncle Peter's son.

165
00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:38.734
Peter Anabohri.

166
00:22:42.238 --> 00:22:44.532
I was little then.

167
00:22:48.369 --> 00:22:49.996
He's a barrister.

168
00:22:55.626 --> 00:22:56.961
I should be going.

169
00:22:57.753 --> 00:23:00.339
- Hold on. Let me pack your food.
- No, it's okay, Auntie.


170
00:23:00.423 --> 00:23:04.051
- It won't take long.
- Leave him.


171
00:23:04.135 --> 00:23:06.929
- What about your drink?
- He's in a hurry.


172
00:23:07.013 --> 00:23:08.431
I'll have it.

173
00:23:08.514 --> 00:23:10.850
- Goodbye.
- Mofe, take it easy.


174
00:23:10.933 --> 00:23:11.934
Bye-bye.

175
00:23:15.271 --> 00:23:16.814
Clarence, Clarence.

176
00:23:17.481 --> 00:23:20.151
- Clarence, Clarito.
- Don't you start.


177
00:23:27.366 --> 00:23:30.453
If you choose this one,
we can actually give you a band.


178
00:23:31.078 --> 00:23:32.997
But you will have to tip the boys.

179
00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:37.543
What about coffins?

180
00:23:38.252 --> 00:23:41.047
We sell those ones.
Come. Let me show you.


181
00:23:52.433 --> 00:23:53.434
Oh, no.

182
00:23:53.517 --> 00:23:55.478
- It's too expensive.
- Too expensive?


183
00:23:56.395 --> 00:23:59.148
If you want, we -
You give us the money.


184
00:23:59.231 --> 00:24:02.193
We can arrange materials for you,
and make something cheaper.


185
00:24:04.403 --> 00:24:06.280
How much are the materials?

186
00:24:06.363 --> 00:24:07.448
Well, it depends.

187
00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:15.039
Ebony, 12,000 naira,
but that's because it's scarce.


188
00:24:16.082 --> 00:24:17.708
Mahogany, 5,000.

189
00:24:18.209 --> 00:24:20.711
And then regular materials, 1,000 naira.

190
00:24:22.713 --> 00:24:24.465
Listen, listen.

191
00:24:25.966 --> 00:24:29.762
The way we leave this world
is very important.


192
00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:30.930
Very, very important.

193
00:24:31.013 --> 00:24:32.264
If you're burying someone,

194
00:24:32.348 --> 00:24:34.725
it's good to show people
that they were loved,


195
00:24:35.226 --> 00:24:37.686
that the lives they lived mattered.

196
00:24:40.815 --> 00:24:44.068
- The deposit is 18,000?
- 18,000.


197
00:24:47.238 --> 00:24:48.364
Give us a minute.

198
00:24:52.243 --> 00:24:53.244
Papa?

199
00:24:54.578 --> 00:24:56.080
- Papa?
- Yes.


200
00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.541
It's too much.

201
00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:01.585
Papa, we discussed this yesterday.

202
00:25:03.003 --> 00:25:05.673
They're your children,
your grandchildren.


203
00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:07.758
I asked you yesterday.
You said fine.


204
00:25:11.262 --> 00:25:12.847
So you don't have anything?

205
00:25:20.563 --> 00:25:22.481
Hold this. Here's 13,000.

206
00:25:30.656 --> 00:25:31.657
Thank you.

207
00:25:32.158 --> 00:25:34.160
You know this is just the deposit.

208
00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:40.416
Good work. Good work.

209
00:25:48.757 --> 00:25:50.843
Thank you. Welcome.

210
00:25:50.926 --> 00:25:52.595
For here or to go?

211
00:25:52.678 --> 00:25:53.888
To go.

212
00:26:01.061 --> 00:26:03.355
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.


213
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.066
It's in God's hands.

214
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:50.861
Mr. Vincent.

215
00:26:53.656 --> 00:26:54.823
You want tea?

216
00:26:56.575 --> 00:26:57.910
Let me get you water.

217
00:27:09.171 --> 00:27:10.297
Thank you.

218
00:27:15.052 --> 00:27:17.304
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you, sir.


219
00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:21.934
- Generator?
- Yes, sir.


220
00:27:22.851 --> 00:27:23.894
Jesus.

221
00:27:24.728 --> 00:27:25.729
We're finished.

222
00:27:34.697 --> 00:27:36.615
- Let me not disturb you.
- It's no problem.


223
00:27:36.699 --> 00:27:38.951
No, I should be going.

224
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.001
Don't worry about next month's rent.

225
00:27:50.087 --> 00:27:51.130
Are you serious?

226
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.882
Seriously. Take your time.

227
00:27:55.009 --> 00:27:56.552
I know it's not easy,

228
00:27:57.052 --> 00:27:59.305
and you people have always been good.

229
00:28:02.891 --> 00:28:04.476
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

230
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.521
God will bless you. Thank you.

231
00:28:16.322 --> 00:28:18.615
<i>Engineer. Come in, please, engineer.</i>

232
00:28:21.994 --> 00:28:23.120
I read you.

233
00:28:24.496 --> 00:28:27.249
<i>There's a problem
with the cutting machine.</i>


234
00:28:29.376 --> 00:28:30.836
What kind of problem?

235
00:28:34.048 --> 00:28:35.466
<i>It's not working.</i>

236
00:28:37.926 --> 00:28:39.511
<i>Engineer, come in, please.</i>

237
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:54.193
Wait. Let me try this side.

238
00:29:04.745 --> 00:29:06.705
Are you okay?

239
00:29:07.706 --> 00:29:09.541
Show me, show me.

240
00:29:10.334 --> 00:29:11.543
Show me.

241
00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:19.051
All right. Come over here.

242
00:29:23.555 --> 00:29:25.307
Hold still.

243
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:36.151
Shouldn't I go to a hospital?

244
00:29:38.821 --> 00:29:40.239
You're a mechanic now.

245
00:29:44.493 --> 00:29:45.494
Hold it.

246
00:29:45.577 --> 00:29:48.163
Boss, wait. This thing is painful.

247
00:29:48.247 --> 00:29:50.582
- Please.
- Hold still.


248
00:30:03.262 --> 00:30:04.972
Hold this on top.

249
00:30:47.806 --> 00:30:51.018
Here, here.
Let me take your passport photo.


250
00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:53.729
He knows where he's going.

251
00:30:53.812 --> 00:30:54.897
Get lost!

252
00:30:56.106 --> 00:30:57.858
Harassing my client.

253
00:30:57.941 --> 00:30:59.443
Don't mind them.

254
00:31:01.695 --> 00:31:03.322
You are ready to apply now?

255
00:31:03.405 --> 00:31:05.449
Where's your letter of invitation?

256
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:07.910
Employment letter?

257
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.000
You need your letter of invitation,
letter of employment,


258
00:31:15.083 --> 00:31:18.003
bank statements - six months,
and a medical report.


259
00:31:18.086 --> 00:31:21.006
Go to your hospital. Pay your doctor
to give you medical report.


260
00:31:21.089 --> 00:31:23.759
So everything now will cost you 50,000.

261
00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:27.763
You don't have a letter of invitation.
You don't have a letter of employment.


262
00:31:27.846 --> 00:31:29.765
My guys will get these things for you.

263
00:31:30.474 --> 00:31:33.519
I'm the one doing the forms, right? Cool.

264
00:31:34.019 --> 00:31:36.730
So later, you text me
your details on WhatsApp.


265
00:31:38.148 --> 00:31:39.399
WhatsApp.

266
00:31:40.275 --> 00:31:43.195
Okay.
I'll call you in three or four days' time.


267
00:31:43.278 --> 00:31:44.279
You come back.

268
00:31:44.363 --> 00:31:46.406
If I need anything from you,
you'll bring it.


269
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:47.991
It's easier this way, right?

270
00:31:48.992 --> 00:31:50.244
Great. No worries.

271
00:32:01.755 --> 00:32:03.465
Are you Goddey?

272
00:32:04.216 --> 00:32:05.509
No.

273
00:32:05.592 --> 00:32:08.303
Because that's the only other name
on the account, sir.


274
00:32:08.845 --> 00:32:10.681
Can I see the balance?

275
00:32:10.764 --> 00:32:13.892
No, sir. It's for account holders only.

276
00:32:19.022 --> 00:32:21.483
Is Goddey the husband?

277
00:32:21.567 --> 00:32:22.943
No, it's her son.

278
00:32:23.026 --> 00:32:24.778
Okay. How old is he?

279
00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:26.071
He's dead.

280
00:32:27.322 --> 00:32:30.242
- I'm sorry for your loss, sir.
- It's okay.


281
00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:37.624
- Are you the only living relative?
- Yes.


282
00:32:39.918 --> 00:32:43.505
Bisi, do we have any probate forms?

283
00:33:11.366 --> 00:33:13.243
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

284
00:33:13.327 --> 00:33:15.621
We're still trying to
move into our new building.


285
00:33:19.291 --> 00:33:21.209
All right. So what
can I do for you?

286
00:33:32.512 --> 00:33:35.515
- Do you know how much is in the account?
- No, sir.


287
00:33:39.853 --> 00:33:40.979
All right.

288
00:33:41.063 --> 00:33:47.861
I will have to to send you to my man,
Bonaventure.


289
00:33:50.072 --> 00:33:53.200
Tell him that you're from
Emeka's law office,


290
00:33:53.283 --> 00:33:55.744
and you'll be needing an affidavit, okay?

291
00:33:57.954 --> 00:34:01.166
Now, when you get the affidavit,

292
00:34:01.249 --> 00:34:04.711
we will need to place notices
on two national dailies


293
00:34:04.795 --> 00:34:07.005
announcing her death and asking people

294
00:34:07.089 --> 00:34:10.384
who believe they have a claim
on her property to step forward. Okay?


295
00:34:22.729 --> 00:34:24.189
One more thing.

296
00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:29.444
I'll need you to fill out this.

297
00:34:31.154 --> 00:34:32.447
It's a client form.

298
00:34:33.407 --> 00:34:35.450
Don't worry. It's for formality.

299
00:34:42.874 --> 00:34:48.255
My fee is normally 10,000 naira
plus 10% of whatever is recovered,


300
00:34:48.338 --> 00:34:52.467
but since you're from Mr. Vincent,
it's 6,000 naira plus 10%.


301
00:34:56.513 --> 00:34:58.223
How long will it take?

302
00:35:00.267 --> 00:35:02.978
Everything shouldn't be
more than a few weeks.


303
00:35:04.396 --> 00:35:06.815
Is 2,000 okay for now?

304
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.912
Put the last one here,
then turn on the switch.


305
00:35:20.996 --> 00:35:22.914
- This one?
- Yeah.


306
00:35:33.925 --> 00:35:36.219
- All of them?
- All of them.


307
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.622
Did it shock you?

308
00:36:04.164 --> 00:36:05.665
No, I'm dancing.

309
00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:08.668
Sorry.

310
00:36:09.252 --> 00:36:10.295
It's okay.

311
00:36:19.387 --> 00:36:21.973
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening.


312
00:36:27.062 --> 00:36:28.688
Did you come to watch me pack?

313
00:36:29.815 --> 00:36:30.816
No, ma'am.

314
00:36:33.568 --> 00:36:35.821
The junction boxes haven't arrived.

315
00:36:37.697 --> 00:36:38.990
Well, I've placed the order.

316
00:36:39.783 --> 00:36:41.409
It will get here when it gets here.

317
00:36:42.536 --> 00:36:44.579
Can you see what is causing the delay?

318
00:36:45.205 --> 00:36:48.750
Engineer, I already told you.
It will get here soon.


319
00:36:51.044 --> 00:36:52.796
The machines will stop working.

320
00:36:54.714 --> 00:36:58.343
Okay. I'll check it tomorrow.

321
00:36:59.386 --> 00:37:00.554
Good night.

322
00:37:37.549 --> 00:37:38.717
Hey, Mofe!

323
00:37:39.759 --> 00:37:40.844
How have you been?

324
00:37:40.927 --> 00:37:42.053
Afternoon, sir.

325
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.978
Mr. Clarence here will be representing
your father in this matter.


326
00:37:50.061 --> 00:37:51.104
My father?

327
00:37:52.272 --> 00:37:55.150
Didn't you place the notices
for the next of kin?


328
00:37:57.152 --> 00:38:00.614
Your father has made legal claims
on your sister's estate.


329
00:38:00.697 --> 00:38:03.408
- Now the truth is that -
- Who told him?


330
00:38:03.491 --> 00:38:04.618
I did.

331
00:38:06.161 --> 00:38:07.746
Look, Mofe...

332
00:38:10.457 --> 00:38:11.708
The law

333
00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:14.753
is very clear about this.

334
00:38:14.836 --> 00:38:16.671
Your sister died intestate,

335
00:38:16.755 --> 00:38:21.551
and legally her property
is to be shared among the family.


336
00:38:21.635 --> 00:38:26.014
Considering you are not a parent or child,

337
00:38:27.432 --> 00:38:28.850
you must wait.

338
00:38:30.352 --> 00:38:31.353
Look.

339
00:38:31.436 --> 00:38:33.271
Your father is not a greedy man.

340
00:38:34.606 --> 00:38:37.192
He's willing to let
you have up to 20%,

341
00:38:37.275 --> 00:38:39.694
which is very kind, you know?

342
00:38:39.778 --> 00:38:42.072
Because legally his claim -

343
00:38:42.155 --> 00:38:45.367
I will die before he touches that money!

344
00:39:33.832 --> 00:39:35.917
<i>Come in, engineer. 
Please come in.</i>

345
00:39:39.713 --> 00:39:41.131
I read you, ma'am.

346
00:39:41.756 --> 00:39:45.135
<i>What's happening over there?
Why is everything still down?</i>


347
00:39:46.219 --> 00:39:48.054
We are working on it, ma'am.

348
00:39:51.307 --> 00:39:54.644
<i>Engineer, come in. 
Please come in.</i>

349
00:39:54.728 --> 00:39:56.730
I read you, ma'am.

350
00:39:56.813 --> 00:39:59.024
<i>What does that mean,
you're working on it?</i>


351
00:39:59.691 --> 00:40:01.067
Ma'am, we are working on it.

352
00:40:01.151 --> 00:40:02.736
We need a few minutes.

353
00:40:03.903 --> 00:40:05.864
<i>Hurry up, please. 
We're behind.</i>

354
00:40:20.003 --> 00:40:21.254
Are you okay?

355
00:40:44.277 --> 00:40:45.445
Are you crazy?

356
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.740
Engineer?

357
00:40:50.158 --> 00:40:51.785
You sure you're not crazy?

358
00:40:54.537 --> 00:40:56.164
Engineer, I'm talking to you!

359
00:41:00.335 --> 00:41:03.671
I can't believe what you did.
You're going to have to pay for this.


360
00:41:03.755 --> 00:41:06.466
Every single thing you're costing us,
you will pay.


361
00:41:06.549 --> 00:41:07.759
Every naira!

362
00:41:10.303 --> 00:41:12.639
How can you do this? God!

363
00:41:16.351 --> 00:41:18.812
You have nothing to say
for yourself, right?


364
00:41:22.315 --> 00:41:23.316
Get out.

365
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.111
Get out!

366
00:41:27.695 --> 00:41:28.696
Now!

367
00:41:42.293 --> 00:41:44.838
Madam said I should collect your ID card.

368
00:42:02.647 --> 00:42:04.190
Boss, you're traveling?

369
00:42:04.732 --> 00:42:07.026
Please, please. I don't know.

370
00:42:11.656 --> 00:42:12.949
Good night.

371
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.836
- Maybe it's the fuel.
- The fuel?


372
00:44:30.712 --> 00:44:33.214
Yes, you know most of the fuel
we have here is dirty.


373
00:44:33.298 --> 00:44:36.467
- What do you mean?
- I mean the quality is bad.


374
00:44:39.137 --> 00:44:41.139
But wouldn't it show in the engine?

375
00:44:41.931 --> 00:44:44.642
Not always. Most times you won't see it.

376
00:44:44.726 --> 00:44:46.394
You won't see a thing at all.

377
00:45:00.575 --> 00:45:01.743
You want to eat?

378
00:45:03.494 --> 00:45:05.913
Hell, yeah. Sure thing, man.

379
00:45:07.373 --> 00:45:11.127
- I don't play when it comes to food.
- Well, in that case, you're paying.


380
00:45:12.003 --> 00:45:13.296
No problem.

381
00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:15.089
Should I leave this here?

382
00:45:15.173 --> 00:45:16.215
Leave it.

383
00:45:22.555 --> 00:45:27.852
<i>If I don't vote and you don't vote,
how will we choose our leaders?</i>


384
00:45:34.567 --> 00:45:40.698
<i>Anybody able to lead us
to a better Nigeria</i>


385
00:45:40.782 --> 00:45:42.575
<i>is the best candidate.</i>

386
00:46:17.735 --> 00:46:19.112
Hello, Auntie.

387
00:46:20.696 --> 00:46:21.989
Is Papa there?

388
00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.943
Someone's been waiting for you
to get their hair washed. Be quick.


389
00:47:01.362 --> 00:47:02.738
Don't block the mirror.

390
00:47:10.746 --> 00:47:13.166
Be quick, be quick.
She's been waiting all day.


391
00:47:58.169 --> 00:48:00.922
- Afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Auntie.


392
00:48:01.005 --> 00:48:02.882
- How are you?
- Fine.


393
00:48:10.556 --> 00:48:12.099
Did you do your passport?

394
00:48:14.852 --> 00:48:16.062
Grace.

395
00:48:16.145 --> 00:48:17.271
Passport?

396
00:48:18.105 --> 00:48:19.315
No.

397
00:48:20.942 --> 00:48:22.693
What about your medicine?

398
00:48:24.195 --> 00:48:25.321
Yes.

399
00:49:04.318 --> 00:49:07.572
Long Island iced tea. 
With ice as well?

400
00:49:25.548 --> 00:49:28.467
I know this man, Agbim!

401
00:49:29.427 --> 00:49:30.845
Stingy Agbim!

402
00:49:31.762 --> 00:49:32.847
Angela!

403
00:49:34.807 --> 00:49:38.769
- But I know this man. He's nice.
- You see? He's nice.


404
00:49:39.812 --> 00:49:43.065
Forget about him. 
He's so cheap.

405
00:49:43.149 --> 00:49:46.360
Please, I'm sweating. 
Where is Mercy?

406
00:49:48.613 --> 00:49:53.242
Hey. So she said there's this new place
in V.I. that we should try.


407
00:49:53.326 --> 00:49:54.493
Tonight?

408
00:49:56.287 --> 00:49:59.624
Babe, I'm tired. 
I'm gonna go home.

409
00:50:00.124 --> 00:50:02.293
- See you later.
- All right, darling.


410
00:50:02.376 --> 00:50:04.003
- Rosa.
- Bye.


411
00:50:04.587 --> 00:50:05.963
Get home safe.

412
00:50:15.389 --> 00:50:16.390
Babe?

413
00:50:17.099 --> 00:50:19.727
Could you drop me at CMS?

414
00:50:47.296 --> 00:50:48.756
You didn't go to school today?

415
00:50:49.965 --> 00:50:51.550
I wasn't feeling too well.

416
00:50:52.259 --> 00:50:53.552
What about your passport?

417
00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.681
Grace?

418
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.475
I didn't have time.

419
00:51:00.101 --> 00:51:02.978
So what are you doing now?
I'm sure they're still open.


420
00:51:03.062 --> 00:51:05.481
I'm still not feeling too well.
I'll do it tomorrow.


421
00:51:05.564 --> 00:51:06.982
You should do it today.

422
00:51:12.655 --> 00:51:14.532
Here. Take this.

423
00:51:17.785 --> 00:51:19.245
Well, get up now.

424
00:52:06.751 --> 00:52:08.377
I've been calling you.

425
00:52:08.461 --> 00:52:09.754
I've been busy.

426
00:52:10.588 --> 00:52:13.007
But all week you haven't been
taking my calls.


427
00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:14.675
Mr. Vincent, what do you want?

428
00:52:16.552 --> 00:52:19.680
Nothing, nothing. 
I was just worried.

429
00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:25.603
- Are you angry?
- No. No, I'm not angry.


430
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:30.191
I'm sorry. Please.

431
00:52:33.402 --> 00:52:36.405
Have you fixed your light?
I brought you some bulbs.


432
00:52:39.033 --> 00:52:40.367
Thank you.

433
00:52:41.076 --> 00:52:43.621
Come on, let me fix it for you.

434
00:52:55.049 --> 00:52:57.384
I haven't heard from you in a while.

435
00:52:57.468 --> 00:53:00.262
Mr. Vincent, please,
I've got too much on my mind.


436
00:53:02.348 --> 00:53:03.849
What is wrong?

437
00:53:03.933 --> 00:53:05.935
Don't worry about it.
It's not your problem.


438
00:53:06.852 --> 00:53:10.523
Am I not here? 
Please talk to me.

439
00:53:11.941 --> 00:53:13.901
- I need money.
- For what?


440
00:53:13.984 --> 00:53:15.820
Mr. Vincent, I said don't worry.

441
00:53:19.573 --> 00:53:20.741
How much?

442
00:53:25.871 --> 00:53:28.290
What if I ask you not to pay
this month's rent?


443
00:53:28.374 --> 00:53:29.375
No!

444
00:53:30.543 --> 00:53:32.670
What if I ask you to pay half?

445
00:53:38.092 --> 00:53:40.135
Mr. Vincent, no. Thank you.

446
00:53:41.762 --> 00:53:43.764
You have to choose one.

447
00:53:46.016 --> 00:53:48.185
I'm only trying to help.

448
00:53:53.482 --> 00:53:56.694
If I agree, the condition is
that I'll pay you back next month.


449
00:54:02.575 --> 00:54:03.576
Look.

450
00:54:03.659 --> 00:54:05.953
What I want is for us
to trust each other.


451
00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:11.333
You need any help, you ask me.
And if I can, definitely I will.


452
00:54:39.361 --> 00:54:41.906
- What are you doing?
- They were closed.


453
00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:01.050
Why are you like this?

454
00:55:03.802 --> 00:55:06.388
I ask you to do something
and you can't even do it.


455
00:55:06.472 --> 00:55:08.515
I told you they were
closed and you said -

456
00:55:08.599 --> 00:55:10.142
You've had the entire week!

457
00:55:10.809 --> 00:55:12.227
And what about school?

458
00:55:18.817 --> 00:55:21.779
You'd better start behaving yourself
or I'll send you back.


459
00:55:41.256 --> 00:55:42.257
Good afternoon.

460
00:55:42.341 --> 00:55:44.385
We came for a checkup.

461
00:55:57.773 --> 00:56:01.694
Grace, your folate levels are low.
I'm concerned.


462
00:56:01.777 --> 00:56:03.821
Have you been taking your medicine?

463
00:56:08.409 --> 00:56:11.829
I can't stress how important it is
for you to take your medicine.


464
00:56:12.329 --> 00:56:15.165
You're risking the health of your baby
if you don't.


465
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:25.676
What's going on?

466
00:56:27.678 --> 00:56:29.054
Grace?

467
00:56:33.934 --> 00:56:37.521
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I didn't mean it, okay?


468
00:56:38.439 --> 00:56:40.024
Grace, I said I'm sorry.

469
00:56:41.358 --> 00:56:43.527
You need to start taking your medication.

470
00:56:44.028 --> 00:56:45.362
Promise you'll take them.

471
00:56:46.113 --> 00:56:48.449
All right. Gimme a smile.

472
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:53.412
It's 5,000.

473
00:56:56.123 --> 00:56:57.291
Card?

474
00:57:17.186 --> 00:57:18.353
Take this.

475
00:57:18.896 --> 00:57:20.105
Thank you.

476
00:57:33.494 --> 00:57:35.496
Hello, Mommy.

477
00:57:37.206 --> 00:57:40.000
No, no, it's fine. We're okay.

478
00:57:41.502 --> 00:57:43.378
She's fine. You want to talk to her?

479
00:57:48.425 --> 00:57:49.426
Hello?

480
00:57:50.177 --> 00:57:51.303
Mommy?

481
00:57:57.101 --> 00:57:58.393
I'm fine.

482
00:57:59.144 --> 00:58:00.562
School is fine.

483
00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:05.984
How is everybody?

484
00:58:07.444 --> 00:58:11.406
Mom, Rosa wants her phone.
I'll call you back when I get credit.


485
00:58:14.827 --> 00:58:16.745
Hello, Mommy. I have to get going.

486
00:58:17.246 --> 00:58:18.622
I'm late for work.

487
00:58:19.289 --> 00:58:20.666
Yes, Mom. Take care.

488
00:58:48.277 --> 00:58:51.155
Sorry to disturb. I'm closing soon.
Can I get the bill?


489
00:58:53.073 --> 00:58:54.283
Sure.

490
00:58:55.159 --> 00:58:57.744
Actually, can I get one more whiskey?

491
00:59:21.476 --> 00:59:23.478
- Current or savings?
- Current.


492
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:30.861
I'm still getting used to this.

493
00:59:36.533 --> 00:59:37.910
Are you from "Lahgos"?

494
00:59:38.911 --> 00:59:40.037
What?

495
00:59:40.621 --> 00:59:41.747
Lagos.

496
00:59:42.956 --> 00:59:44.583
No, I'm from Abeokuta.

497
00:59:45.083 --> 00:59:47.252
I'm not even gonna try to say that.

498
00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.255
- You're American?
- Yeah.


499
00:59:50.839 --> 00:59:52.049
But you look Lebanese.

500
00:59:52.132 --> 00:59:53.592
My parents are Lebanese.

501
00:59:54.176 --> 00:59:55.385
I thought so.

502
00:59:56.261 --> 00:59:58.847
- We have a lot of those in Nigeria.
- I know.


503
00:59:59.723 --> 01:00:01.225
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


504
01:00:04.728 --> 01:00:06.521
- This is...
- Rosa.


505
01:00:11.735 --> 01:00:12.903
Ready?

506
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:15.155
Wait.

507
01:00:15.697 --> 01:00:16.740
I'm so sorry.

508
01:00:18.116 --> 01:00:19.326
I forgot to tip.

509
01:00:24.081 --> 01:00:27.376
So, you're getting off soon, right?

510
01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:28.710
Yes.

511
01:00:28.794 --> 01:00:31.088
You wanna hang out
with me and my friends?


512
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:32.881
No, that's fine.

513
01:00:33.715 --> 01:00:35.092
It's completely fine.

514
01:00:35.801 --> 01:00:37.636
She can hang, right?

515
01:00:38.428 --> 01:00:39.763
It's okay. Really.

516
01:00:40.472 --> 01:00:42.474
Really, it's fine. 
Thank you though.

517
01:00:46.353 --> 01:00:49.231
But if you want,
I can give you my number.


518
01:00:49.314 --> 01:00:50.857
- Yeah?
- Why not?


519
01:01:24.224 --> 01:01:25.309
Hey!

520
01:01:26.018 --> 01:01:28.603
How are you? Is your mom home?

521
01:01:32.733 --> 01:01:35.193
- Auntie Blessing is here.
- Who?


522
01:01:35.277 --> 01:01:37.863
- Blessing.
- Who is Auntie Blessing?


523
01:01:37.946 --> 01:01:41.033
Mercy, baby! Hey!

524
01:01:41.116 --> 01:01:45.120
My baby girl for life!
So good to see you!


525
01:01:45.203 --> 01:01:47.914
- You look great!
- Auntie, I'm just managing.


526
01:01:47.998 --> 01:01:52.044
Shut up! What do you mean managing?
You look wonderful!


527
01:01:52.544 --> 01:01:53.879
These are my friends.

528
01:01:55.964 --> 01:01:57.007
Come in, come in.

529
01:01:59.217 --> 01:02:01.094
- I like your dress.
- Thank you.


530
01:02:02.846 --> 01:02:07.059
Mercy, Mercy. Please, what can I get you?
Coke, Fanta?


531
01:02:07.559 --> 01:02:09.561
- Anything.
- Lucia!


532
01:02:11.605 --> 01:02:14.649
Go and get some Cokes, my love.

533
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:18.362
Make sure she doesn't break
my expensive glasses.


534
01:02:20.697 --> 01:02:21.698
So,

535
01:02:22.783 --> 01:02:24.534
you're the one that's pregnant?

536
01:02:24.618 --> 01:02:26.036
Yes, ma'am.

537
01:02:27.704 --> 01:02:30.040
- How many months?
- Almost four.


538
01:02:33.085 --> 01:02:35.962
And the two of you
want to go to Italy?

539
01:02:36.046 --> 01:02:37.172
Yes, ma'am.

540
01:02:37.255 --> 01:02:40.509
That's good. I'm just coming back.
My husband is there.


541
01:02:41.343 --> 01:02:42.511
Do you have papers?

542
01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.773
Lucia, go and play.

543
01:03:03.323 --> 01:03:06.576
- Have you started prenatal?
- Yes.


544
01:03:07.828 --> 01:03:10.080
Next time you come,
bring her medical report.


545
01:03:15.836 --> 01:03:18.672
Okay. Give me your number.

546
01:03:30.559 --> 01:03:32.519
As soon as I get the visas, 
I'll call you.

547
01:03:32.602 --> 01:03:35.814
I've been doing this a long time.

548
01:03:35.897 --> 01:03:39.609
Mercy will tell you
I've been doing this a long time.


549
01:03:45.532 --> 01:03:46.533
He's American.

550
01:03:46.616 --> 01:03:48.160
He went to school there.

551
01:03:51.037 --> 01:03:52.247
He's cute.

552
01:03:59.671 --> 01:04:02.757
- Does he have any friends?
- At your age!


553
01:04:49.095 --> 01:04:51.723
- You know what your clothes look like?
- What?


554
01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:52.933
Death.

555
01:04:54.893 --> 01:04:58.188
- They're not nice.
- What about yours?


556
01:04:58.271 --> 01:05:01.983
Grace, look at me. 
Learn from the best.

557
01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:04.569
- Color riot.
- It is not color riot.


558
01:05:04.653 --> 01:05:06.738
And the nice ones aren't yours.

559
01:05:07.322 --> 01:05:09.115
Can you wear your sister's dress?

560
01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:13.036
Does she have more?

561
01:05:16.498 --> 01:05:18.583
Grace, Grace. Look at this one.

562
01:05:19.876 --> 01:05:24.714
- Do you want her to kill me?
- She won't do anything. Try this dress.


563
01:05:25.382 --> 01:05:30.345
Blue color plus your brown eyes
gives you blue-brown.


564
01:05:30.428 --> 01:05:31.972
Take it from me, girl.

565
01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:58.748
What's up?

566
01:05:59.958 --> 01:06:01.960
Are you guys doing a photo shoot?

567
01:06:03.753 --> 01:06:05.297
What's up, baby?

568
01:06:05.797 --> 01:06:07.173
Can I join in?

569
01:06:09.301 --> 01:06:10.302
How exactly?

570
01:06:11.344 --> 01:06:14.931
Take a picture of us on Snapchat.

571
01:06:16.558 --> 01:06:17.642
Grace.

572
01:06:19.936 --> 01:06:23.440
Look how fine she is.

573
01:06:27.402 --> 01:06:28.653
That's enough.

574
01:06:29.613 --> 01:06:31.573
Take another one.

575
01:06:36.202 --> 01:06:38.580
- Did you save it?
- Sure, pal.


576
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:42.208
What's the rush?

577
01:06:42.292 --> 01:06:43.877
I have somewhere to go to.

578
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.170
Wait.

579
01:06:47.339 --> 01:06:48.590
Relax.

580
01:06:48.673 --> 01:06:52.177
Let me buy something
for you and your friend.


581
01:06:53.219 --> 01:06:56.431
Anything you want,
I'll get for both of you.


582
01:06:58.933 --> 01:07:00.477
You want something to eat?

583
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:04.981
I cut her in on this deal
that I was working on.


584
01:07:05.065 --> 01:07:07.484
Nothing major, just a little forex thing.

585
01:07:07.567 --> 01:07:11.738
She stood to make ten, maybe 15 US,
which isn't bad for a few months' work.


586
01:07:13.907 --> 01:07:16.326
So, the meeting's set.

587
01:07:16.409 --> 01:07:19.204
We're about to close,
and she calls to cancel.


588
01:07:19.287 --> 01:07:20.830
You know what she says?

589
01:07:20.914 --> 01:07:24.918
"I have to go and see my uncle now.
He's the one that sponsored my education."


590
01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:26.753
You know what that means.

591
01:07:26.836 --> 01:07:30.632
The thing is, you should've known that
before you brought her in.


592
01:07:31.716 --> 01:07:33.593
There was nothing I could do.

593
01:07:33.677 --> 01:07:37.430
These people, you can show them
all the income statements you want.


594
01:07:37.514 --> 01:07:38.932
It doesn't make any difference.

595
01:07:39.015 --> 01:07:41.226
They're mostly interested
in working with someone


596
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:43.687
who's willing to offer
a little extra on the side.


597
01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:48.233
Put her in a tight dress
next time you pitch. See what happens.


598
01:07:52.362 --> 01:07:57.033
Luckily, we were far enough along that
we managed to get it closed and move on.


599
01:07:57.117 --> 01:08:00.578
Last time though.
I can tell you that for free. Never again.


600
01:08:01.496 --> 01:08:03.790
Sounds to me like
you didn't have enough money.


601
01:08:04.833 --> 01:08:06.710
15K is not that much money.

602
01:08:37.574 --> 01:08:40.452
You should take the first bite.
Let me know what you think.


603
01:08:45.123 --> 01:08:47.250
- And?
- What's this, please?


604
01:08:47.333 --> 01:08:50.295
It's tofu. You don't like it?

605
01:08:50.378 --> 01:08:54.299
No? How could you not like it.
It's so good. I love tofu.


606
01:08:56.676 --> 01:08:59.756
Can we please have a menu? We're gonna
order something else with this as well.


607
01:08:59.804 --> 01:09:02.140
- We don't need to order something else.
- It's fine.


608
01:09:02.223 --> 01:09:04.100
Just the menu, sir, please.

609
01:09:05.518 --> 01:09:07.228
I can't believe you don't like this.

610
01:09:07.312 --> 01:09:08.772
- There's no pepper.
- No pepper?


611
01:09:08.855 --> 01:09:10.732
Yeah. It just tastes like grass.

612
01:09:12.609 --> 01:09:15.528
It's not grass.
It's broccoli, mushrooms, corn.


613
01:09:15.612 --> 01:09:16.780
Grass.

614
01:09:20.742 --> 01:09:23.286
- Is that a plantain?
- Yes.


615
01:09:25.497 --> 01:09:26.790
Look at this one.

616
01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:32.462
Disgusting.

617
01:09:44.432 --> 01:09:46.768
- Good evening, uncle.
- Good evening.


618
01:09:47.435 --> 01:09:48.770
How are you?

619
01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:56.194
- Are you going to eat that?
- No.


620
01:09:56.694 --> 01:09:58.738
We think our fridge is broken.

621
01:09:59.656 --> 01:10:01.115
Can I see it?

622
01:10:15.672 --> 01:10:17.048
It's not cooling again.

623
01:10:17.549 --> 01:10:19.801
But my friend can fix it for you.

624
01:11:34.167 --> 01:11:37.754
- You want to charge?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.


625
01:11:48.598 --> 01:11:50.183
That's our fridge.

626
01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:54.020
Oh, please.

627
01:11:54.896 --> 01:11:58.274
Sorry for the delay. 
I'll work on it next.

628
01:11:58.358 --> 01:12:00.485
It's fine. Thank you.

629
01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:05.782
So are you going to fix everything here?

630
01:12:07.992 --> 01:12:09.744
Did someone teach you?

631
01:12:11.537 --> 01:12:13.247
I just understand it.

632
01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:19.963
- Should I turn on the sound?
- Can you?


633
01:12:20.046 --> 01:12:21.339
Of course.

634
01:12:36.104 --> 01:12:37.355
Enjoy.

635
01:12:58.376 --> 01:12:59.460
How are you?

636
01:13:00.003 --> 01:13:01.170
I'm fine.

637
01:13:01.671 --> 01:13:02.755
You sure?

638
01:13:15.727 --> 01:13:16.936
For me?

639
01:13:17.895 --> 01:13:20.398
Thank you so much. Thank you.

640
01:13:26.487 --> 01:13:27.572
You're welcome.

641
01:13:27.655 --> 01:13:29.449
Bring it. I'll keep it inside.

642
01:13:31.284 --> 01:13:32.952
Oh, you're smiling now.

643
01:13:37.749 --> 01:13:39.250
We ate on the roof.

644
01:13:39.333 --> 01:13:40.418
I don't understand.

645
01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:44.297
It was a restaurant, and I could see
the whole of Lagos from there.


646
01:13:45.631 --> 01:13:47.216
What about the mall?

647
01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.678
What don't they have there?
Clothes, electronics, food.


648
01:13:59.729 --> 01:14:00.980
Grace, go out.

649
01:14:02.732 --> 01:14:03.816
Good afternoon, sir.

650
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.568
- How are you?
- Fine.


651
01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.747
- Have I not been taking care of you?
- You have.


652
01:14:21.417 --> 01:14:23.669
So why are you disgracing me like this?

653
01:14:23.753 --> 01:14:25.713
How am I disgracing you?

654
01:14:26.672 --> 01:14:32.053
Rosa, take your time.
Take your time. I'm not a fool.


655
01:14:36.682 --> 01:14:38.309
Why can't you love me?

656
01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:41.521
What's wrong with you? Stop now!

657
01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:43.272
What's all this?

658
01:14:43.356 --> 01:14:46.859
So now you have somebody else
and you don't want me again, right?


659
01:14:49.821 --> 01:14:53.324
Okay. No problem.
Let him take care of you.


660
01:14:55.576 --> 01:14:59.497
But I don't want you to call me again
for anything. Understand?


661
01:14:59.997 --> 01:15:01.624
Don't call me!

662
01:15:42.081 --> 01:15:43.291
It's so tall.

663
01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:48.129
It's similar to the building
I told you about where I'll be visiting.


664
01:15:50.047 --> 01:15:51.340
This is it here.

665
01:15:53.092 --> 01:15:54.677
I know it's great, right?

666
01:15:55.386 --> 01:15:56.804
I can't wait.

667
01:15:59.182 --> 01:16:00.600
When are you going back?

668
01:16:01.809 --> 01:16:07.356
I don't know. I need another 10,000
before I can apply for the visa.


669
01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.441
Naira?

670
01:16:08.941 --> 01:16:12.069
No, dollars. US dollars.

671
01:16:12.737 --> 01:16:16.866
The money has to be in your account
before they'll agree.


672
01:16:18.784 --> 01:16:23.247
I was hoping I could get the money here,
but man, these guys aren't fools.


673
01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:29.128
- Is it Seyi?
- Hell, no!


674
01:16:30.963 --> 01:16:34.634
No, I don't play with people like that.

675
01:16:34.717 --> 01:16:38.763
He'll be looking at you like you're
nobody, but he'll still be looking at you.


676
01:16:39.472 --> 01:16:41.557
I thought I was the only one
that felt that way.


677
01:16:41.641 --> 01:16:44.644
If you make the mistake
of letting him sleep with you,


678
01:16:44.727 --> 01:16:46.437
you're on your own.

679
01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:50.441
"Father is ill. 
He's in the hospital."

680
01:16:50.524 --> 01:16:54.111
And they won't treat him unless
they first receive some money.


681
01:16:54.195 --> 01:16:55.696
"Maybe you can just help me."

682
01:16:57.907 --> 01:16:59.659
You guys got it all wrong.

683
01:17:02.662 --> 01:17:05.706
Just because she calls you daddy
does not mean she's your daughter.


684
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:09.001
I officially hate you.
We're done. We're done.


685
01:17:13.172 --> 01:17:16.259
Has she come and asked you
if you can help pay her tuition?


686
01:17:16.342 --> 01:17:19.637
That if you don't pay her school fees,
they're going to kick her out?


687
01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.514
Or her brother's application fee?

688
01:17:21.597 --> 01:17:25.351
The best is when they say
that they need money


689
01:17:25.434 --> 01:17:27.728
to maintain themselves for you.

690
01:17:28.688 --> 01:17:32.316
What's wrong with getting maintained?
All of this doesn't just happen.


691
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.527
There are levels.

692
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:37.196
You and her are not the same.

693
01:17:45.288 --> 01:17:46.872
Has she come to you and said,

694
01:17:46.956 --> 01:17:50.501
"Please, could you buy me a smartphone
so I can send you better pictures?"


695
01:17:53.838 --> 01:17:55.798
No, you did not!

696
01:17:58.592 --> 01:18:00.303
It wasn't an iPhone or anything.

697
01:18:03.973 --> 01:18:05.391
I get here.

698
01:18:05.474 --> 01:18:09.478
It takes me forever to get my luggage
because everybody just, like, swarms.


699
01:18:09.562 --> 01:18:12.732
People shove each other
out of the way here to grab things.


700
01:18:12.815 --> 01:18:14.108
Welcome to Lagos.

701
01:18:15.067 --> 01:18:18.362
This lady just shoved this man
out of the way to jump into a cab.


702
01:18:30.374 --> 01:18:32.501
That's how they push people
around in Lagos.


703
01:18:34.587 --> 01:18:37.590
Anyway, so I grab my luggage,
and I'm on my way towards the exit.


704
01:18:37.673 --> 01:18:42.303
And there's these tables set up
with these army looking guys, right?


705
01:18:42.386 --> 01:18:44.138
I guess they're your customs people.

706
01:18:44.221 --> 01:18:46.849
- If you guys have customs.
- We have customs in Nigeria now.


707
01:18:46.932 --> 01:18:48.642
Now? You didn't have them before?

708
01:18:48.726 --> 01:18:50.644
No, we've always had customs.

709
01:18:52.146 --> 01:18:54.440
Doesn't every country?

710
01:18:54.523 --> 01:18:56.567
I don't know. Things seem different here.

711
01:18:57.234 --> 01:19:00.529
So the guy is missing an eye,
and he points me out -


712
01:19:00.613 --> 01:19:01.739
Sorry.

713
01:19:09.872 --> 01:19:12.875
- Why don't you just pick up the phone?
- Don't worry about it.


714
01:19:14.085 --> 01:19:15.461
So the customs person...

715
01:19:15.544 --> 01:19:20.007
The guy that was at the table,
he points me out and he goes, "You!"


716
01:19:20.091 --> 01:19:22.468
I go over to him,
and he doesn't look in my bag.


717
01:19:22.551 --> 01:19:25.513
- He just asks me what's in the bag.
- You didn't open it for him?


718
01:19:25.596 --> 01:19:28.057
He didn't open the bag.
He asked me what was in there.


719
01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:31.727
I was like, "It's just clothes."
And my camera was in there and some,


720
01:19:31.811 --> 01:19:33.854
you know, toothpaste or whatever.

721
01:19:33.938 --> 01:19:37.733
And he goes, "What
did you bring for me?"

722
01:19:37.817 --> 01:19:40.903
I was like, "What did I bring for you?"
I don't -


723
01:19:46.283 --> 01:19:47.701
Sorry. Let me just...

724
01:19:49.578 --> 01:19:50.746
Hello?

725
01:19:51.539 --> 01:19:52.665
Yes.

726
01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:02.967
Mr. Vincent, what do you want?

727
01:20:03.926 --> 01:20:06.220
Why are you calling me?
I don't understand.


728
01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.767
No, I'm not at home.
I'm at my auntie's house.


729
01:20:17.523 --> 01:20:18.774
I'm not angry.

730
01:20:19.608 --> 01:20:21.068
No, I'm not.

731
01:20:24.238 --> 01:20:25.656
When I come back.

732
01:20:26.699 --> 01:20:28.784
Mr. Vincent, when I come back.

733
01:20:51.515 --> 01:20:54.268
Sorry about that. 
It was my sister.

734
01:20:56.562 --> 01:20:58.063
Everything all right?

735
01:20:58.147 --> 01:20:59.273
Yes.

736
01:21:09.325 --> 01:21:12.203
What happened to the phone
that I bought you?


737
01:21:13.078 --> 01:21:14.747
I gave it to my sister.

738
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:18.167
I hope you're not annoyed.

739
01:21:18.876 --> 01:21:20.085
No, I just -

740
01:21:22.421 --> 01:21:24.840
Was it for her from the get-go?

741
01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:29.220
Why didn't you just tell me
it was for her from the beginning?


742
01:21:30.638 --> 01:21:34.016
Because I didn't want you thinking
that maybe I was just using you.


743
01:21:40.606 --> 01:21:42.066
It's fine. It's fine.

744
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:45.611
I think it's actually really nice
that you did that for her.


745
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:02.169
Can I ask you a favor?

746
01:22:02.253 --> 01:22:03.462
Yeah, of course.

747
01:22:05.214 --> 01:22:07.258
I really need help with my rent.

748
01:22:11.637 --> 01:22:14.431
I swear I would not you ask
if I had another option.


749
01:22:16.559 --> 01:22:18.644
I'm having issues with my landlord.

750
01:22:24.650 --> 01:22:26.318
You know what? 
Don't worry about it.

751
01:22:27.236 --> 01:22:28.862
I'm sorry. I just -

752
01:22:29.947 --> 01:22:31.740
My mind went somewhere else. I'm sorry.

753
01:22:33.617 --> 01:22:35.869
Your rent? Just your rent?

754
01:22:35.953 --> 01:22:37.037
Just my rent.

755
01:22:38.038 --> 01:22:40.332
It's because of my landlord.
I don't want -


756
01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:43.627
I get it. I understand. 
I know it's hard.

757
01:22:45.462 --> 01:22:48.340
Just let me know how much you need.
I'll take care of it.


758
01:22:48.966 --> 01:22:50.175
Are you serious?

759
01:22:53.178 --> 01:22:54.388
Thank you.

760
01:22:58.851 --> 01:23:00.019
I know it's rough.

761
01:23:02.146 --> 01:23:03.272
Thank you.

762
01:23:16.994 --> 01:23:19.496
How long did you say
you've been having these headaches?


763
01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:20.789
For a week.

764
01:23:26.545 --> 01:23:30.924
If it persists or gets worse,
come back immediately and see us.


765
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:35.846
But, Grace,
you really need to take it easy.


766
01:23:45.105 --> 01:23:47.066
Do you want to know
the sex of the baby?

767
01:23:52.154 --> 01:23:53.447
It's a girl.

768
01:24:18.472 --> 01:24:20.933
- You're not changing your mind, right?
- No.


769
01:24:24.561 --> 01:24:27.022
You will take an oath
before the baby is born.


770
01:24:28.065 --> 01:24:31.819
But I want you to swear
that you'll give it to me.


771
01:24:33.862 --> 01:24:36.115
- The baby?
- Yes.


772
01:24:41.787 --> 01:24:42.788
Okay.

773
01:24:42.871 --> 01:24:43.872
What?

774
01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:48.919
I swear.

775
01:25:02.641 --> 01:25:03.976
Swear on this.

776
01:25:14.069 --> 01:25:15.904
I swear I'll give you my baby.

777
01:25:34.214 --> 01:25:37.968
Now, don't touch that money.

778
01:25:38.927 --> 01:25:41.346
You'll put some hairs from your privates,

779
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:44.767
some blood,
and one passport picture inside.


780
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:48.771
Now?

781
01:25:50.439 --> 01:25:51.607
Not now.

782
01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:54.151
When you're at eight months,
we'll seal the oath.


783
01:25:55.277 --> 01:25:56.278
Take.

784
01:26:02.451 --> 01:26:03.786
All right. Get going.

785
01:26:17.257 --> 01:26:18.467
Where are you going?

786
01:26:20.219 --> 01:26:21.845
Is that how you greet?

787
01:26:24.598 --> 01:26:26.350
So you don't know how to greet?

788
01:26:26.433 --> 01:26:28.769
They didn't teach you
how to greet in your house?


789
01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:32.898
- What did you come to do?
- I want to lose these braids.


790
01:26:32.981 --> 01:26:34.191
Rosa!

791
01:26:42.991 --> 01:26:45.035
You're finally ready to remove them?

792
01:26:45.536 --> 01:26:47.079
Yeah, the hair is tired.

793
01:28:04.239 --> 01:28:07.993
Good afternoon. Perfume?
Body spray? Powder?


794
01:28:21.506 --> 01:28:24.509
Good afternoon. Perfume?
Body spray? Powder?


795
01:28:28.055 --> 01:28:30.390
Good afternoon. Perfume?
Body spray? Powder?


796
01:28:31.516 --> 01:28:33.894
- Do you like this one?
- How much is it?


797
01:28:33.977 --> 01:28:35.187
2,000.

798
01:28:36.396 --> 01:28:38.857
- What's your final price?
- 2,000.


799
01:28:38.941 --> 01:28:41.151
2,000? No lower?

800
01:28:57.125 --> 01:28:59.711
- It declined.
- The card?


801
01:29:00.545 --> 01:29:01.880
Please, can you try again?

802
01:29:20.816 --> 01:29:21.984
It's going.

803
01:29:29.783 --> 01:29:32.077
Am I getting it?

804
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.578
Let me show you.

805
01:29:33.662 --> 01:29:34.788
Do like this.

806
01:29:41.253 --> 01:29:42.421
Tolu!

807
01:29:44.339 --> 01:29:45.340
Tolu!

808
01:29:51.138 --> 01:29:53.140
- Do you not have homework to do?
- I finished.


809
01:29:53.223 --> 01:29:56.560
Then go sweep the floor.
Can't you see the house is dirty?


810
01:30:02.065 --> 01:30:04.985
And you?
Don't you think you should be lying down?


811
01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.232
Is there any other person
that can attend to us, please?


812
01:30:46.151 --> 01:30:47.319
Onyinye!

813
01:30:48.862 --> 01:30:50.280
Onyinye!

814
01:30:51.323 --> 01:30:53.075
Why are you shouting my name?

815
01:30:53.909 --> 01:30:57.370
Is there any other doctor that can
attend to us? This is very urgent.


816
01:30:57.871 --> 01:30:59.122
What's wrong with her?

817
01:30:59.206 --> 01:31:01.208
My sister is bleeding from her privates.

818
01:31:03.043 --> 01:31:05.295
- Just come.
- Thank you.


819
01:31:40.288 --> 01:31:43.041
Doctor, they said you want
to keep her overnight.


820
01:31:43.125 --> 01:31:45.377
Yes, so we can monitor her.

821
01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:48.213
She's okay,
but her blood is very high.


822
01:31:48.296 --> 01:31:52.217
I completely understand that,
but can I pay tomorrow?


823
01:31:54.344 --> 01:31:56.429
I've been coming here
for a very long time,


824
01:31:56.513 --> 01:31:58.223
and Dr. Ojo normally attends to us.

825
01:31:58.306 --> 01:32:02.310
She knows. Everybody here knows.
I don't ever delay on payments.


826
01:32:02.394 --> 01:32:03.562
It's true.

827
01:32:07.190 --> 01:32:08.817
You can be sure that I'll pay.

828
01:32:12.904 --> 01:32:15.448
First thing tomorrow morning. Understand?

829
01:32:16.324 --> 01:32:17.951
First thing, or we remove her.

830
01:32:40.932 --> 01:32:43.018
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.


831
01:32:45.645 --> 01:32:48.064
- How are you?
- I'm fine.


832
01:32:49.274 --> 01:32:50.609
You called me.

833
01:32:50.692 --> 01:32:52.777
Mr. Vincent, please, 
I need your help.

834
01:32:53.403 --> 01:32:55.655
- What'd you say?
- I need your help, please.


835
01:32:55.739 --> 01:32:57.157
You need my help?

836
01:32:58.158 --> 01:32:59.701
Is that why you called me?

837
01:33:02.537 --> 01:33:05.123
Mr. Vincent, Grace is in the hospital.

838
01:33:05.207 --> 01:33:07.292
Please, I don't know what to do anymore.

839
01:33:07.375 --> 01:33:11.129
I beg you, in the name of God.
I know I treated you badly. I'm sorry.


840
01:33:11.213 --> 01:33:13.506
Let me ask you, do
you think I'm a fool?

841
01:33:14.549 --> 01:33:16.218
That all you need from me is help.

842
01:33:16.301 --> 01:33:18.553
When you need money,
that's when you come to me?


843
01:33:18.637 --> 01:33:20.597
Mr. Vincent,
I'm sorry for everything I did.


844
01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:23.308
I've tried everything.
I can't raise her hospital bills,


845
01:33:23.391 --> 01:33:26.102
and I don't want anything
to happen to her. Please.


846
01:33:26.186 --> 01:33:28.521
So now you remember Mr. 
Vincent, the fool?

847
01:33:29.022 --> 01:33:32.901
The one you can always get money from
and treat however you like?


848
01:33:32.984 --> 01:33:36.112
Like some piece of dirt on the street.

849
01:33:39.157 --> 01:33:41.952
Mr. Vincent, please.
For the sake of God, please.


850
01:33:42.035 --> 01:33:43.787
Don't do it for me. 
Do it for Grace.

851
01:33:44.829 --> 01:33:47.999
Loan me the money.
Loan it to me and I'll pay you back.


852
01:33:48.083 --> 01:33:49.751
Let me tell you something.

853
01:33:49.834 --> 01:33:53.046
I can always help you.
It's not about the money.


854
01:33:53.129 --> 01:33:55.131
But when you start
to feel as if -

855
01:33:56.967 --> 01:34:00.720
I'm nothing. I'm not a human being,
because you found somebody else.


856
01:34:00.804 --> 01:34:04.391
And then you started to treat me
however you like.


857
01:34:04.474 --> 01:34:06.393
Now you've come for help?

858
01:34:06.893 --> 01:34:08.103
I'm sorry.

859
01:34:12.107 --> 01:34:13.775
So Grace is in the hospital?

860
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:24.411
There's a problem.
It's supposed to be 30,000.


861
01:34:25.161 --> 01:34:27.163
- We had to give her blood.
- Blood?


862
01:34:27.247 --> 01:34:29.833
For what? Why?

863
01:34:29.916 --> 01:34:32.294
Where is my sister? 
Can I see my sister?

864
01:34:32.377 --> 01:34:34.254
Calm down. Let me call the doctor.

865
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:43.638
Doctor, why is Grace receiving blood?

866
01:34:46.808 --> 01:34:49.394
I was just here yesterday night.
She was fine.


867
01:34:49.477 --> 01:34:51.896
Grace is fine. Right?

868
01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:56.943
She's okay. She lost some blood,
so we had to give her a transfusion.


869
01:34:57.027 --> 01:34:58.903
But she's better now.

870
01:35:01.031 --> 01:35:03.742
- Can I see her?
- Not immediately. She's in recovery.


871
01:35:03.825 --> 01:35:06.369
But in a little while
you should be able to see her.


872
01:35:15.795 --> 01:35:18.298
Lucia, please be careful.

873
01:35:42.781 --> 01:35:46.743
After all the time and money
that I wasted on you two...


874
01:35:48.244 --> 01:35:49.245
Sorry, ma'am.

875
01:35:50.663 --> 01:35:54.167
It's not about sorry. We have a problem.
Sit down.


876
01:36:02.133 --> 01:36:05.470
So, do you still want to travel?

877
01:36:05.553 --> 01:36:06.638
Yes, ma'am.

878
01:36:08.306 --> 01:36:10.600
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


879
01:36:11.101 --> 01:36:14.062
Good. Because I want you to travel.

880
01:36:15.313 --> 01:36:18.233
I promised I would take care of you,
and I like to keep my promises.


881
01:36:18.316 --> 01:36:20.819
But our agreement was that
I would have your sister's baby


882
01:36:20.902 --> 01:36:22.654
in exchange for transport over there.

883
01:36:22.737 --> 01:36:27.075
But as it is, no baby.
I've wasted so much money.


884
01:36:27.158 --> 01:36:28.493
I paid for your visas!

885
01:36:28.993 --> 01:36:31.788
I need to know that if you travel,
I will be paid back.


886
01:36:31.871 --> 01:36:34.874
- I can't.
- I know.


887
01:36:34.958 --> 01:36:37.544
You work for me.
I will take it out of your salary.


888
01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:42.090
What about my sister?

889
01:36:42.173 --> 01:36:45.593
She will work too.
Or do you want to pay for her as well?


890
01:37:41.483 --> 01:37:42.901
Come in, come in.

891
01:37:46.529 --> 01:37:47.739
What can I offer you?

892
01:37:48.239 --> 01:37:49.824
Nothing. I'm fine, thank you.

893
01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:54.329
I wish you called.
I would have arranged the whole place.


894
01:37:56.873 --> 01:37:58.166
Mr. Vincent...

895
01:38:00.418 --> 01:38:03.588
if I marry you, you have to promise
to take care of my family.


896
01:38:11.012 --> 01:38:13.097
Grace has to go to a private school.

897
01:38:17.227 --> 01:38:19.938
And you'll open a shop
for me where I can sell clothes.


898
01:38:25.068 --> 01:38:27.111
And you'll really be my wife?

899
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:35.954
You will love me, cook for me,
clean the house, all those things?


900
01:38:45.088 --> 01:38:46.089
Yes.

901
01:38:49.968 --> 01:38:51.010
Sit down.

902
01:38:59.727 --> 01:39:04.315
I promise you,
I will take care of you and your family.


903
01:39:13.074 --> 01:39:14.951
So what do I offer you?

904
01:39:15.994 --> 01:39:17.370
Nothing. I'm okay.

905
01:39:17.453 --> 01:39:21.583
No. You have to take something.
I'll get you something.


906
01:40:22.018 --> 01:40:24.520
Let me know next
time you go out, okay?

907
01:40:27.065 --> 01:40:29.525
- What's this?
- Money.


908
01:40:30.151 --> 01:40:31.319
From where?

909
01:40:33.488 --> 01:40:34.739
I sold my phone.

910
01:41:50.565 --> 01:41:52.024
- That one.
- This one?


911
01:41:52.984 --> 01:41:54.777
But it's not going to be too big?

912
01:41:54.861 --> 01:41:57.488
The same size as this,
and make sure it's straight.


913
01:41:59.949 --> 01:42:02.785
Don't worry.
I'm going to make you happy.


914
01:42:05.538 --> 01:42:08.082
If it's not straight,
I'll go somewhere else.


915
01:42:08.916 --> 01:42:11.043
I'm going to make you happy.
Don't worry.


916
01:42:12.128 --> 01:42:13.838
It's my work. It's my job.

917
01:42:20.678 --> 01:42:21.679
Engineer.

918
01:42:22.221 --> 01:42:24.849
Welcome back.

919
01:42:25.516 --> 01:42:27.977
How are you?

920
01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:31.355
What about business?

921
01:42:35.568 --> 01:42:36.986
Where's Wisdom?

922
01:42:37.069 --> 01:42:39.989
Wisdom? At your house.

923
01:42:41.699 --> 01:42:43.826
Do you mind staying? 
I'll be right back.

924
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:46.621
No problem. Take your time.

925
01:42:46.704 --> 01:42:47.705
I'm coming back.

926
01:43:00.343 --> 01:43:02.386
- Welcome.
- Good evening, sir.


927
01:43:04.764 --> 01:43:06.307
Let me get back to work.

928
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:08.267
Auntie, later. Blessing.

929
01:43:08.976 --> 01:43:11.896
- Sorry. I'll be back.
- No problem, boss.


930
01:43:15.233 --> 01:43:17.443
- How's work?
- It's okay.


931
01:43:22.198 --> 01:43:23.491
Is that enough?

932
01:43:32.166 --> 01:43:33.501
This okay?

933
01:43:47.932 --> 01:43:48.933
How is it?

934
01:43:50.643 --> 01:43:53.563
- Good, right?
- Yeah, it's good.


935
01:44:10.496 --> 01:44:11.622
Well done.

936
01:44:12.623 --> 01:44:13.624
Thank you.

937
01:44:18.671 --> 01:44:20.965
Are you here all night?

938
01:44:21.966 --> 01:44:23.134
Mostly.

939
01:44:23.634 --> 01:44:25.303
Sometimes it's Wisdom.

940
01:44:30.016 --> 01:44:32.560
Well, I'm happy you're doing well.

941
01:44:34.061 --> 01:44:35.062
Thank you.

942
01:44:37.023 --> 01:44:38.316
Mofe,

943
01:44:39.317 --> 01:44:41.485
your father is sick.

944
01:44:46.324 --> 01:44:47.909
So you've come for money.

945
01:44:47.992 --> 01:44:50.036
No, we haven't.

946
01:44:51.454 --> 01:44:55.249
Mofe, listen to me.

947
01:44:57.251 --> 01:44:59.337
We didn't come for money.

948
01:45:02.048 --> 01:45:06.177
Your father is already better.
He'll be out of the hospital soon.


949
01:45:08.346 --> 01:45:10.723
We came here because...

950
01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:20.191
Mofe, we're broke.

951
01:45:21.734 --> 01:45:23.819
We've spent everything.

952
01:45:23.903 --> 01:45:28.449
My money, his money,
even Blessing's money.


953
01:45:30.409 --> 01:45:34.163
Mofe, we don't have anything again.

954
01:45:34.246 --> 01:45:35.373
Please.

955
01:45:35.456 --> 01:45:37.375
Please get up. Get up.

956
01:45:37.458 --> 01:45:39.752
Mofe, please. Take my son from me.

957
01:45:39.835 --> 01:45:40.836
I can't.

958
01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.422
If he comes back with me,
there's nothing there for him.


959
01:45:43.506 --> 01:45:46.425
It's only me here. 
I work for myself.

960
01:45:47.885 --> 01:45:50.513
Why should I take care
of my father's children?


961
01:45:52.098 --> 01:45:56.060
The first time he saw Precious's children
was when we came to bury them.


962
01:45:59.772 --> 01:46:03.442
And you want me to
take care of his children?


963
01:46:03.526 --> 01:46:04.527
Never!

964
01:46:30.845 --> 01:46:31.846
Thank you.

965
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.460
Careful of your bags.

966
01:47:16.974 --> 01:47:20.770
Auntie, here's a little something.
Blessing, help your mother.


967
01:47:38.329 --> 01:47:39.538
What about power?

968
01:47:41.290 --> 01:47:44.168
When you're ready, we'll tap it.

969
01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:50.716
You don't like it?
Should I show you another one?


970
01:47:51.801 --> 01:47:52.885
Yeah.

971
01:47:52.968 --> 01:47:54.303
All right. Let's go.

972
01:47:54.386 --> 01:47:56.972
Hey. Don't forget to close up.

973
01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:06.398
It's ready.

974
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.627
Try it and see.

975
01:48:26.710 --> 01:48:28.295
I know you're going to like it.

976
01:48:37.138 --> 01:48:38.347
Now put it on.

977
01:48:41.183 --> 01:48:43.102
We know what we're doing for you here.

978
01:48:43.185 --> 01:48:45.312
- It looks good.
- Yeah, very good.


979
01:49:06.625 --> 01:49:07.835
Boss.

980
01:49:09.545 --> 01:49:10.713
Come and take a look.

981
01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:16.260
What do you think?

982
01:49:18.304 --> 01:49:19.680
Good work.

983
01:49:25.144 --> 01:49:26.270
Hello?

984
01:49:28.689 --> 01:49:30.858
Hey, Auntie.

985
01:49:30.941 --> 01:49:33.194
No, sorry. I was busy.

986
01:49:35.571 --> 01:49:36.697
Yes.

987
01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:40.534
Thank you. Thank you. I'm fine.

988
01:49:46.373 --> 01:49:47.374
Generator.

989
01:49:47.875 --> 01:49:50.294
No, no. It's Wisdom I'm talking to.

990
01:49:54.506 --> 01:49:58.636
No, it's no problem. No problem.

991
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:04.099
Truly, Auntie, it's no problem.

992
01:50:08.145 --> 01:50:10.898
I hope it's not too late
for him to register.


993
01:50:16.195 --> 01:50:17.321
We thank God.

994
01:50:21.242 --> 01:50:27.998
If there's anything else he needs,
like books or anything else,


995
01:50:29.124 --> 01:50:30.334
just let me know.

996
01:50:32.002 --> 01:50:35.422
And I'll be checking
in from time to time.

997
01:50:40.261 --> 01:50:41.553
Bye-bye.
