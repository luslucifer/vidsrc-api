10
00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.780
Good morning, guys.
It's me, Padgett Head to Toe here,


11
00:01:14.863 --> 00:01:17.238
where we talk about makeovers,
self-improvement,


12
00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:20.530
and how to become
the most spectacular you you can be.


13
00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.988
Now, as I always say
when it comes to makeovers,


14
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:24.571
it's your insides that count.

15
00:01:24.655 --> 00:01:27.363
But your outsides
are the first thing people see.


16
00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:30.238
I didn't get my full eight last night
because I was up studying,


17
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:31.613
and as some of you saw,

18
00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:33.988
baking some super delicious treats.

19
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:38.613
So, this morning's routine is
going to take a little bit extra effort.


20
00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:42.155
Wow, okay. You guys have
already asked a lot of questions.


21
00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:43.613
So let's dive right in.

22
00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:46.446
CandyLaLa09, cute name by the way,

23
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.821
wants to know how my morning routine
is different after a late night.


24
00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:51.030
Great question, Candy.

25
00:01:51.113 --> 00:01:55.488
These Bunny Venom revival eye patches
are always my fav for eye puff.


26
00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:58.196
I had coffee last night,
which is super dehydrating,


27
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.113
so I'll work in
some Alo Head-to-Toe Glow Oil


28
00:02:01.196 --> 00:02:04.530
to get rid of the dryness
and add a whisper of cream blush.


29
00:02:04.613 --> 00:02:08.196
Okay, ZoeWorld88 says she has a giant zit,

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.196
and they're taking her senior pictures
in two days. Poor thing.


31
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.946
Rule number one,
never try to pop it with your fingers.


32
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.488
Apply a warm compress.

33
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:18.696
Oh! DIY quick fix,
take some soft toilet paper,


34
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.405
a little toothpaste,

35
00:02:20.488 --> 00:02:22.280
dab it on. Dries it right out.

36
00:02:35.863 --> 00:02:38.655
- Hey, another late night?
- Ah, 7:00 to 7:00.


37
00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:40.863
- Hmm, how was it?
- Well, let's see.


38
00:02:40.946 --> 00:02:43.363
We had, hmm, two heart attack victims,

39
00:02:43.446 --> 00:02:46.738
a toddler with a watch battery
stuck in her nose.


40
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:48.071
- Oh my gosh.
- Yeah.


41
00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:50.863
And a gentleman on meth
with a stab wound to the neck.


42
00:02:50.946 --> 00:02:52.446
Yikes! What a nightmare.

43
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.155
Yeah, it was pretty awful.
They were just thrashing around,


44
00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:57.613
cursing at everyone,
spitting on the orderlies.


45
00:02:57.696 --> 00:03:00.905
- Man, meth really messes you up.
- Oh no, that was the toddler.


46
00:03:00.988 --> 00:03:04.238
Yeah. The guy on meth
actually seemed really sweet.


47
00:03:04.321 --> 00:03:05.321
Until he smiled.

48
00:03:05.863 --> 00:03:07.863
His teeth, ugh... Pretty rough.

49
00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:11.363
- Yes!
- I've been waiting for this!


50
00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:14.696
Almost $3,000 for, um...

51
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.155
Tell me what you do again?

52
00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:17.613
I'm just mostly kidding.

53
00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:20.530
But I just hope that some of it
goes towards your college fund.


54
00:03:20.613 --> 00:03:21.839
- Not more of...
- Mom.


55
00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:23.613
Those shoes cost more than our dishwasher.

56
00:03:23.696 --> 00:03:25.946
These are Bunny Venom comps. Totally free.

57
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.946
Which reminds me, do you have any idea
how my bill from the plumber got paid?


58
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.363
Oh! Yeah, I Venmo'd the repairman.

59
00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:34.780
- Honey.
- What?


60
00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:36.446
I saw the bill on the counter.

61
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.238
I figured, I mean, you work so hard
to keep us in the school district.


62
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:44.363
Yes, this amazing school district
full of snotty, entitled trust funders.


63
00:03:44.446 --> 00:03:47.280
Hey, some of my best friends
are entitled trust funders.


64
00:03:47.363 --> 00:03:50.530
Exactly. And then you feel
this tremendous pressure to keep up.


65
00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:53.696
You want me to go to a college
full of entitled trust funders.


66
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.863
And I'm actually late to meet the ones
who drive me to school every day.


67
00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:59.155
- Love you.
- Mm.


68
00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:00.113
Bye.

Oh, please tell me those aren't

76

What?

77
00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:23.071
Croquembouche with white cream filling.
I saw your story.


78
00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:25.530
From scratch.
And I made them with almond flour


79
00:04:25.613 --> 00:04:27.363
because Jordan is gluten-free now.

80
00:04:27.446 --> 00:04:29.366
- Seriously?
- He's shooting his big video today.


81
00:04:29.446 --> 00:04:32.655
- I wanted to surprise him.
- Oh right. The big follow-up single.


82
00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:34.905
- What's it called again?
- "Turf War in the 424."


83
00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:38.446
He's being ironic, I think.

84
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.988
And it's a lot of pressure
dealing with all this sudden fame.


85
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:44.488
Please. The guy's completely gorgeous
with half a million followers.


86
00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:46.863
- What does he have to be stressed about?
- I don't know.


87
00:04:46.946 --> 00:04:49.446
- Why don't you ask him when you see him?
- Yes! I'm so down.


88
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.238
So where's the set? Hollywood?

89
00:04:51.321 --> 00:04:53.030
- Beverly Hills?
- Canoga Park.


90
00:04:53.113 --> 00:04:54.113
Ew.

91
00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:55.655
Isn't that the Valley?

92
00:04:55.738 --> 00:04:58.238
That's like the valley of the Valley.

93

Why do you listen
to that crap all the time?


108
00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:34.946
Jordan Van Draanen's music is not crap.
You haven't even heard his other songs.


109
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.113
Okay, what are his other songs?

110
00:05:37.863 --> 00:05:39.321
He hasn't recorded them yet.

111
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:44.030
You act like you're so above it all,
but I think you're just jealous.

Jordan's this super popular guy
in your grade, and you're just a...

A fountain of truth

- Ugh.


116
00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:56.488

- No, see, I hate things that suck.


117
00:05:56.571 --> 00:05:59.196

- Where'd you get that shirt?
- I found it.


128
00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:25.988
- In your truck.
- Hmm.


129
00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:27.780
What? It looks better on me, man.

130
00:06:27.863 --> 00:06:30.113
Yeah, sure.
I'm gonna start stealing your stuff.


131
00:06:30.196 --> 00:06:32.488
So, what's on the sched for the weekend?

132
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:34.988
Um, I have work Friday, and then we have

133
00:06:35.071 --> 00:06:37.655
that Jimmy Wang double feature
at the New Beverly, right?


134
00:06:37.738 --> 00:06:39.821
The same double feature
we saw last weekend?


135
00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:41.571
No. That was Johnny Wang, all right?

136
00:06:41.655 --> 00:06:43.797
Jimmy's Taiwanese, Johnny's Chinese.
Totally different.


137
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:47.405
Right. Sounds like more sweaty dudes
kicking each other in the nads.


138
00:06:47.488 --> 00:06:51.280
How about we see my friend Jada's band?
She's opening for Bunker Mose at The Door.


139
00:06:51.363 --> 00:06:53.506
Isn't she the one who tried
to hit me with her ukulele?


140
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.488
You called her music twee and derivative.

141
00:06:55.571 --> 00:06:56.571
Well it is.

142
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.405
Look, I gave her a compliment
for keeping her songs under two minutes.


143
00:07:00.488 --> 00:07:01.780
Oh my God. Seriously.

144
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.090
She acts like she doesn't even know me.

145
00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:09.696
That's just because
she's tremendously ashamed of you.


146
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.780
Huh.

147
00:07:11.988 --> 00:07:13.655
Hi, little sis!

148
00:07:13.738 --> 00:07:15.113
Did you get your Lunchables?

149
00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:17.363
Oh, don't forget
to take your laxatives too!


150
00:07:17.446 --> 00:07:20.488
- The doctor says you need to stay regular!
- Shut up!


151
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.113
Oh my God.

152
00:07:23.738 --> 00:07:25.488
You're so evil, you know that?

153
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:27.696
Um, did you talk to your parents
about our trip?


154
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.071
'Cause I was thinking,
what if we start in Portugal


155
00:07:30.155 --> 00:07:31.155
instead of Spain,

156
00:07:31.238 --> 00:07:32.998
and then we make our way up
north from there.


157
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.321
Well, wherever we do end up,

158
00:07:34.405 --> 00:07:36.863
as long as we get back
by August for my orientation.


159
00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:38.196
UC Riverside, really?

160
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.530
What? I think I'd do really well there
without having to work very hard.


161
00:07:41.613 --> 00:07:43.113
Plus, it's near Legoland.

162
00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.738
I effing love Legoland.

163
00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:46.863
Isn't UCSD the one near Legoland?

164
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.821
I think I made a huge mistake.

165
00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:55.738
This is so cool. I've never been
on the set of a music video before.


166
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:58.863
Try working on one.
We're an hour behind, wardrobe just quit,


167
00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:01.738
and I am 90%
sure I'm getting pink eye.

168
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:04.446
- Ew.
- Jordan's trailer's this big one here.


169
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.446
Make it fast.
We're calling him to set soon.


170
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.155
Okay, we'll do it live.

171
00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.655
When I cue you,
press this and follow me inside.


172
00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:12.280
Yep, I know how to work a phone.

173
00:08:12.363 --> 00:08:13.946
- Thanks.
- And action.


174
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.321
Okay, guys. We're live here, and surprise!

175
00:08:16.405 --> 00:08:18.155
We're on the set
of Jordan's brand-new video


176
00:08:18.238 --> 00:08:19.946
in beautiful Hollywood, California.

177
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.863
- Canoga Park.
- Same thing.


178
00:08:21.946 --> 00:08:24.488
I can't wait to see his face.

179
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.280
Hello?

180
00:08:26.363 --> 00:08:28.613
Wow. He's really blasting that music.

181
00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:30.655
Is he listening to himself?

182
00:08:30.738 --> 00:08:31.655
Yeah. So?

183
00:08:31.738 --> 00:08:32.571
Come on.

184
00:08:33.738 --> 00:08:36.196
Jordan?

185
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.363
- Jordan!
- Padgett?


186
00:08:37.446 --> 00:08:39.155
- Padgett!
- What are you doing?


187
00:08:39.238 --> 00:08:40.738
What do you think they're doing?

188
00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:44.696
- Okay, let's not freak out here. Okay?
- Oh my God. I'm so, so sorry.


189
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.405
I have no idea how this happened.

190
00:08:47.488 --> 00:08:50.155
Padgett, I'm such a big fan.

191
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.488
I'm Aniston, by the way.

192
00:08:51.571 --> 00:08:52.988
Your name is Aniston?

193
00:08:53.071 --> 00:08:54.363
It's a family name.

194
00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:56.405
Well, you've made them very proud.

195
00:08:56.488 --> 00:08:57.738
- Thank you.
- Ugh!


196
00:08:57.821 --> 00:08:59.071
- You scumbag!
- Padge.


197
00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:00.988
I made you croquembouche!

198
00:09:01.071 --> 00:09:02.071
Okay.

199
00:09:02.113 --> 00:09:03.655
I even made them with almond flour

200
00:09:03.738 --> 00:09:05.655
so you wouldn't fart
during your precious video!


201
00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:07.946
- Check this out.
<i>- I can't believe you!</i>


202
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.030
Is this why you told me
not to visit the set?


203
00:09:10.113 --> 00:09:12.321
<i>So you could hook up
with the backup dancer?</i>


204
00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:13.839
No!

205
00:09:13.863 --> 00:09:15.321
Oh my God!

206
00:09:15.405 --> 00:09:17.530
I think I just saw
Jordan Van Draanen's thing.


207
00:09:17.613 --> 00:09:20.738
- <i>Aniston is not a first name!</i>
- Not too shabby, JVD.


208
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:22.238
I hate you!

209
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:24.506
- After everything we've been through?
- Padgett!


210
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.738
We're over, okay?

211
00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:29.613
Know what? You don't deserve me, my love,
and you don't deserve my croquembouche.


212
00:09:29.696 --> 00:09:31.488
- You croquem-douche!
- Padgett!


213
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.905
What?!

214
00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:35.405
You're still live.

215
00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:47.696
Padgett, you feeling okay?
Missing school today?


216
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.196
Mom, I'm fine.

217
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.863
I just wanna be alone.

218
00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:55.780
I went through all the trouble
of putting cereal in a bowl with milk.


219
00:09:55.863 --> 00:09:57.113
Lucky Charms? Mom...

220
00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:59.905
I know it's not really
what you eat anymore,


221
00:09:59.988 --> 00:10:02.071
but it cheered you
up when you were eight.

222
00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:04.196
Look, I'm just not hungry, okay?

223
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.238
Suit yourself.

224
00:10:07.405 --> 00:10:09.488
Hmm! Wow. The marshmallows.

225
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:11.821
- I forgot about the marshmallows.
- Mom.


226
00:10:11.905 --> 00:10:14.446
Give me a break.
I've been eating Mueslix for ten years.


227
00:10:15.238 --> 00:10:16.071
Look, honey,

228
00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:20.405
I do know that breakups are hard,
especially your first.


229
00:10:20.488 --> 00:10:22.113
It's not just the breakup.

230
00:10:22.196 --> 00:10:23.321
I was humiliated.

231
00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:26.571
I know that it feels
like the absolute end of the world now,


232
00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:29.738
but I can promise you
with absolute certainty


233
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.071
that it will get better.

234
00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:32.155
Well, when?

235
00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:34.238
Three months.

236
00:10:34.946 --> 00:10:37.488
Maybe a year. Five tops.

237
00:10:37.571 --> 00:10:40.530
Even if it's just you and me
for the rest of our lives,


238
00:10:40.613 --> 00:10:41.446
what do we do?

239
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.905
We get a couple of twin beds,
fierce matching jumpsuits,


240
00:10:44.988 --> 00:10:46.280
a couple dozen more cats.

241
00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:47.738
It would be great.

242
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:50.988
Think about it.

243
00:10:52.238 --> 00:10:54.488
<i>- Hey.
-</i>There you are. I was so worried.


244
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.571
<i>- We missed you at dance practice.
-</i>Sorry, I saw you called.


245
00:10:57.655 --> 00:11:01.155
<i>- I've kinda just been...
-</i>Avoiding life? Can't say I blame you.


246
00:11:01.238 --> 00:11:02.946
Why did I have to go live?

247
00:11:03.446 --> 00:11:05.571
And why did Alden keep recording?

248
00:11:05.655 --> 00:11:08.530
Because you always go live,
and Alden must have been in shock.


249
00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:11.946
Yeah, well, at least everyone got to see
what an asshole Jordan is.


250
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.738
Yeah, I guess.

251
00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:15.196
You guess?

252
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.655
No! I mean, yes. 
You're totally right.

253
00:11:17.738 --> 00:11:19.696
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Q, what's going on?


254
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.780
Nothing.

255
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:24.363
It's just,
I guess you haven't looked online today?


256
00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:35.905
<i>Padgett? Hello?
Are you still there?</i>


257
00:11:35.988 --> 00:11:38.821
I think I'm gonna be sick.
How could this happen?


258
00:11:38.905 --> 00:11:40.738
<i>A few people are being
kind of mean.</i>


259
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:41.655
A few?

260
00:11:43.738 --> 00:11:44.738
Bubble Girl?

261
00:11:45.613 --> 00:11:46.780
Who's Bubble Girl?

262
00:11:46.863 --> 00:11:48.655
<i>You are?</i>

263
00:11:48.738 --> 00:11:50.071
How am I Bubble...

264
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.280
Oh my God.

265
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.988
<i>Padgett, listen to me, okay?
Everything's going to be just fine.</i>


266
00:11:58.071 --> 00:11:59.821
How could you say that? I'm a joke.

267
00:11:59.905 --> 00:12:03.530
I'm a punchline with a disgusting
mucus-themed nickname. I'm...


268
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.363
- Oh no.
<i>- Who is it?</i>


269
00:12:06.446 --> 00:12:09.071
It's Jessica Miles Torres
from Bunny Venom.


270
00:12:11.155 --> 00:12:12.863
Jessica, hi. What's up?

271
00:12:12.946 --> 00:12:15.530
You're going viral in the wrong way.

272
00:12:15.613 --> 00:12:19.905
Okay, so you saw the video,
and while it is unfortunate...


273
00:12:19.988 --> 00:12:23.280
Unfortunate? My ex-husband's
hiking accident was unfortunate,


274
00:12:23.363 --> 00:12:24.696
and he was mauled by bears.

275
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.488
Oh my God. Is... is he okay?

276
00:12:26.571 --> 00:12:28.030
Better than you.

277
00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:30.446
But, honey, I get it. 
I can sympathize.

278
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.280
<i>You were betrayed, mistreated, humiliated.</i>

279
00:12:33.363 --> 00:12:34.655
So you do understand?

280
00:12:34.738 --> 00:12:38.863
Of course. The difference is
you completely lost it in front of, like...


281
00:12:38.946 --> 00:12:41.113
A lot of people. I know.

282
00:12:41.196 --> 00:12:45.613
<i>According to my assistant, 217,463.</i>

283
00:12:45.696 --> 00:12:48.488
Look, we pay you
because you're the makeover girl.


284
00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:50.946
<i>People buy products that you recommend.</i>

285
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.655
And I'm still that girl.

286
00:12:52.738 --> 00:12:54.280
<i>No. You're a meme.</i>

287
00:12:54.363 --> 00:12:55.363
<i>You're Bubble Girl.</i>

288
00:12:55.405 --> 00:12:57.988
And mucus is just not on-brand for us.

289
00:12:58.071 --> 00:13:00.363
<i>But I'm sure
you can get another endorsement.</i>


290
00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.613
Maybe with an antihistamine company?

291
00:13:02.696 --> 00:13:08.321
So wait, you're pulling my sponsorship?
That's really problematic for my college.


292
00:13:08.405 --> 00:13:10.863
Listen, people want Padgett Head to Toe.

293
00:13:10.946 --> 00:13:13.738
- Not Head to Nose.
- I know I've lost a lot of followers.


294
00:13:13.821 --> 00:13:17.238
But I can get them back.
I just need a chance to redeem myself.


295
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:20.196
- That's all.
- Sweetie, I am your biggest supporter.


296
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.655
No one has more faith
in you than I do.

297
00:13:22.738 --> 00:13:26.488
But until you turn things around,
don't talk to me. Love ya.


298
00:13:30.696 --> 00:13:33.405
Look, no one feels worse
for Padge than I do.


299
00:13:33.488 --> 00:13:35.946
But you gotta admit,
she kind of brought it on herself.


300
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.696
You're saying she deserved it?

301
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.696
- Jordan humiliated her.
- Okay, I did not say "deserved."


302
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.613
But after years of this 4.0,
hot boyfriend,


303
00:13:44.696 --> 00:13:47.738
Insta-perfect corporate sponsor streak,
something had to give.


304
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:50.405
- What had to give?
- Uh, Padge, hi.


305
00:13:50.488 --> 00:13:51.321
Hi.

306
00:13:51.405 --> 00:13:53.988
We thought you might
be taking a personal day.


307
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:55.363
No, I'm fine.

308
00:13:55.446 --> 00:13:56.321
Hey, Bubble Girl.

309
00:13:56.405 --> 00:13:59.738
- You need me to pop that thing for you?
- Back off, sleazeball!


310
00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:01.988
Wow. Unbelievable.

311
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:03.071
I'm the victim.

312
00:14:03.155 --> 00:14:05.196
How is Jordan not a complete pariah now?

313
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.946
I checked his profile earlier,
and his numbers are actually going up.


314
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.821
Okay, that's ridiculous.

315
00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:13.696
I mean, who the hell
does he think he is?

316
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.863
When I first met him,
his real name was Jordan Dickman.


317
00:14:16.946 --> 00:14:19.655
A hundred-twenty pounds
of bad skin and tragic hair.


318
00:14:19.738 --> 00:14:21.655
Oh my God, and those clothes.

319
00:14:21.738 --> 00:14:24.905
The popped collars
and that hideous rope necklace?


320
00:14:24.988 --> 00:14:28.946
Remember how he started every conversation
with, "Yo, yo, what's the haps?"


321
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.780
What's the haps?

322
00:14:30.863 --> 00:14:34.405
God. I know it sounds conceited,
but makeovers are my thing.


323
00:14:34.488 --> 00:14:36.613
- Exactly.
- And I made that guy.


324
00:14:36.696 --> 00:14:37.530
Oh, really?

325
00:14:37.613 --> 00:14:39.821
So then why don't you
just make another Jordan?


326
00:14:39.905 --> 00:14:42.006
<i>Attention Earthquakes,
the big night's coming.</i>


327

328
00:14:44.655 --> 00:14:46.335

they'll always remember.</i>


329
00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:49.655
<i>Unless they throw up in their date's shoe
in the limo and remember that instead.</i>


330
00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:51.613
<i>Kidding. Just kidding.</i>

331
00:14:51.696 --> 00:14:52.571
That's it!

332
00:14:52.655 --> 00:14:55.780
You're gonna create another
internationally renowned egomaniac?


333
00:14:55.863 --> 00:14:59.155
No, but I will
create the next prom king.

334
00:14:59.238 --> 00:15:02.530
- Just to piss off Jordan?
- Hm, pissing off Jordan will be a bonus.


335
00:15:02.613 --> 00:15:06.863
This will be me proving that once again,
I can take anything or anyone


336
00:15:06.946 --> 00:15:09.863
and make them popular.
And once we win prom king and queen,


337
00:15:09.946 --> 00:15:12.321
I'll get back all my followers
and my sponsorship.


338
00:15:12.405 --> 00:15:15.363
- Wow, you make it sound easy.
- You don't think I can do it?


339
00:15:15.446 --> 00:15:18.946
No. But I do think
it'll be fun watching you try.


340
00:15:19.488 --> 00:15:20.321
A bet?

341
00:15:20.405 --> 00:15:22.946
Not just a bet. The bet.

342
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.821
- You know, the one we always talked about?
- Um, guys?


343
00:15:25.905 --> 00:15:27.613
That sounds a little extreme.

344
00:15:27.696 --> 00:15:31.530
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- Sure. It'll make it more fun when I win.


345
00:15:31.613 --> 00:15:32.613
Okay.

346
00:15:33.155 --> 00:15:35.613
- Okay, I'm in.
- Good.


347
00:15:35.696 --> 00:15:38.863
Now I just have to pick the guy.

348
00:15:38.946 --> 00:15:41.863
You? No, no, no. See, that's the fun part.

349
00:15:41.946 --> 00:15:44.071
Just so you don't make it
too easy on yourself,


350
00:15:44.155 --> 00:15:45.238
we'll pick the loser.

351
00:15:45.863 --> 00:15:47.238

Lucas Fletcher? 
He's a criminal.

355
00:15:53.988 --> 00:15:56.047
- He's conning those poor 9th graders.
- Yeah.


356
00:15:56.071 --> 00:15:59.321
It's probably just kale chips.
Everybody knows not to trust Lucas.


357
00:15:59.405 --> 00:16:03.113
Intriguing.
He does have a pretty badass car


358
00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:04.696
and a lot of female followers.

359
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.321
I mean, the danger factor

360
00:16:07.405 --> 00:16:08.738
Yeah.

- Sebastian Woo?

Lose the lab coat,

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.738
It says here he just sold an app
to a big gaming company.


366
00:16:20.821 --> 00:16:23.405
He's gonna be like
shoot-cars-in-space rich.

00:16:23.488 --> 00:16:25.238

372
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.530
Taking pictures of what the wastrels
at this school throw away.


373
00:16:41.613 --> 00:16:44.030
- So, now you're photographing garbage?
- Okay, come on.


374
00:16:44.113 --> 00:16:47.113
Look, I mean,
there's a perfectly untouched orange


375
00:16:47.196 --> 00:16:51.071
next to a discarded math textbook.

Oh, that's Cameron something.

00:16:58.946 --> 00:17:00.155
Kweller, I think?

380
00:17:00.238 --> 00:17:03.321
Let's see. Weird.
He's nowhere to be found.


381
00:17:03.405 --> 00:17:07.113
Wait, he made one tweet in 2019,
and all it said was, "No."


382
00:17:07.738 --> 00:17:08.988
It's like he doesn't exist.

383
00:17:09.071 --> 00:17:11.238
He kinda just seems
like he hates everybody.


384
00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:13.696
- Except for her.
- Nisha Mandyam.


385
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.030
- I always thought they were dating.
- Doubtful.


386
00:17:16.113 --> 00:17:17.280
Pretty sure she's gay.

387
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:23.446
Oh! My bad, bro!

389
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:26.988
He is a total disaster.

390

Great.

00:17:39.405 --> 00:17:40.655
- No.
- So sick of them.


394
00:17:40.738 --> 00:17:43.530
- They can't help their reptile brains.
- Are you serious?

of myself more as a pacifist.

I'm sorry. You? A pacifist?

Well, I may have occasionally
been a little... provocative.

you're a photographer, right?

- We need someone to take pictures for...
- No.


426
00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:19.780
- But it's a fundraiser.
- For what?


427
00:19:19.863 --> 00:19:22.155
Is it cancer research or homelessness?

428
00:19:22.238 --> 00:19:24.030
- Actually, the prom.
- Okay.


429
00:19:24.113 --> 00:19:26.988

No, it's sad, actually,
but, um, good luck with that.

Oh my...

432
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:36.488
I'm so sorry about him.
He's literally like that with everybody.


433
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:39.613
- How do you know him?
- He's my brother. Just by blood though.


434
00:19:39.696 --> 00:19:41.863
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not publicize it.

Um, no, not a dick,

444
00:20:03.696 --> 00:20:06.821
but he does tend
to be a bit misanthropic?

445
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:08.321
I sensed that.

446
00:20:09.071 --> 00:20:12.488
Uh, so if he doesn't like people,
what does he like?


447
00:20:12.571 --> 00:20:14.196
Oh, huh, let's see.

00:20:39.988 --> 00:20:44.321
So, um, why are you suddenly
so interested in my brother?


460
00:20:44.905 --> 00:20:48.738
Don't get me wrong, I love him
and all, but that's just 'cause I have to.


461
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:51.613
Uh, curiosity, I guess?

462
00:20:51.696 --> 00:20:52.696
Horses.

463
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.863
- I'm sorry?
- He loves horses.


464
00:20:54.946 --> 00:20:58.030
He works every day
before school at Will Rogers Park.


465
00:20:58.113 --> 00:20:59.655
So like a cowboy, huh?

466
00:20:59.738 --> 00:21:01.405
No, more like a horse girl.

467
00:21:01.488 --> 00:21:04.488
He kind of cried
when he found out unicorns weren't real.


468
00:21:07.071 --> 00:21:09.946
Cameron. What a weird coincidence.

469
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.280
Uh, well, I'm here every morning, so...

470
00:21:13.363 --> 00:21:15.530
I'm pretty sure
the only weird part is you.


471
00:21:15.613 --> 00:21:16.488
Fair enough.

472
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:19.113
I was hoping to take
a riding lesson this morning.


473
00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:20.916
And I figured
since you and I are friends...


474
00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:24.113
- Ah, friends?
- In the sense we go to school together.


475
00:21:24.196 --> 00:21:26.696
Kind of a loose definition.
Don't you think?


476
00:21:27.363 --> 00:21:30.196
Uh, look, I have a lot of work
to get done before school...


477
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.071
So let me help!
Then if there's time afterwards,


478
00:21:33.155 --> 00:21:34.821
we can squeeze in a lesson.

479
00:21:34.905 --> 00:21:38.530
- You don't even know what the job is.
- That's okay. I am at your service.


480
00:21:39.321 --> 00:21:42.238
Ugh! There's just so much of it.

481
00:21:42.321 --> 00:21:44.280
What do horses eat anyway?

482
00:21:44.363 --> 00:21:48.030
Well, that one,
Jimbo over there, he likes Chipotle.


483
00:21:48.113 --> 00:21:49.530
Gilly prefers sushi.

484
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.780
Just horse feed. 
Hay, grass mostly.

485
00:21:53.863 --> 00:21:57.113
Well, this one must have eaten
an entire soccer field.


486
00:21:57.196 --> 00:21:58.696
Well, you offered to help.

487
00:21:59.405 --> 00:22:02.280
I'm starting to think
you've never shoveled crap before.


488
00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:03.863
Only out of a litter box.

489
00:22:04.613 --> 00:22:06.738
And this dump is bigger than my cat.

490
00:22:07.946 --> 00:22:10.571
So, you really come here
every day before school?


491
00:22:10.655 --> 00:22:12.571
Yep, ever since I was 14.

492
00:22:13.863 --> 00:22:17.530
Wow, you really want to chronicle
your post-poop clean-up look?


493
00:22:17.613 --> 00:22:20.113
I chronicle everything. 
That's my job.

494
00:22:20.696 --> 00:22:23.113
So, how about that lesson now?

495
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:27.030
I guess a deal's a deal.

496
00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:30.780
So, do you have
any previous riding experience?


497
00:22:30.863 --> 00:22:33.113
Just one time at a birthday party
when I was five,


498
00:22:33.196 --> 00:22:35.696
but I think it was a baby horse,

499
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.946
or maybe not baby,
but it was small.


500
00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.155
Does that count?

501
00:22:40.238 --> 00:22:44.196
I believe the word
you're looking for is pony and no.


502
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.155
Anyway, this is Gilly.
He can be a little temperamental, so I...


503
00:22:48.238 --> 00:22:50.655
- What are you doing?
- I'm letting him smell my hand.


504
00:22:50.738 --> 00:22:54.821
It's like a handshake for horses.
I did my research last night.


505
00:22:54.905 --> 00:22:57.780
Whoa. Why is he doing that?

506
00:22:57.863 --> 00:22:59.530
Actually means he likes you.

507
00:22:59.613 --> 00:23:02.196
Oh, well, I guess he has good instincts.

508
00:23:02.988 --> 00:23:03.821
Right.

509
00:23:03.905 --> 00:23:06.321
Let's, um, try mounting up.
So come over here.


510
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:10.071
Put your left foot in the stirrup,
grab the reins with your left hand,


511
00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.780
and use your other leg
to haul you up and over.


512
00:23:15.238 --> 00:23:17.571
- I'm a natural, right?
- Not bad.


513
00:23:20.238 --> 00:23:22.196
Um, seriously?

514
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.863
- More?
- I'm just capturing the moment.


515
00:23:24.946 --> 00:23:27.946
You can't enjoy this without sharing it
with 500 strangers?


516
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.238
Five hundred? Try 887,132.

517
00:23:31.321 --> 00:23:33.655
And they're not strangers.
They're followers.


518
00:23:33.738 --> 00:23:35.696
Followers? You mean like a cult?

519
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.363
No, not like a cult.

520
00:23:37.446 --> 00:23:40.280
Just people devoted to me
and totally guided by my advice


521
00:23:40.363 --> 00:23:42.071
as to how to live their lives.

522
00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:44.655
I'm joking. I was just taking a picture.

523
00:23:44.738 --> 00:23:48.196
- You take pictures. What's the difference?
- Too vast to even explain.


524
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.988
Now, come on off the horse.

525
00:23:50.071 --> 00:23:51.488
- That's it? We're done?
- No.


526
00:23:51.571 --> 00:23:53.530
I just want you
to practice getting on and off.


527
00:23:53.613 --> 00:23:55.321
Oh, uh, okay.

528
00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:56.405
Uh...

529
00:23:56.905 --> 00:23:58.696
- Whoa!
- Whoa. Hold on. Hold on.


530
00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.530
Oh!

531
00:24:02.155 --> 00:24:03.696
Ugh...

532
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.655
- Disgusting!
- Sorry!


533
00:24:06.738 --> 00:24:07.613
Sorry for laughing.

534
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:10.238
It's just I've never seen
such an uncoordinated dismount.


535
00:24:10.321 --> 00:24:12.946
I mean,
aren't you captain of the dance team...


536
00:24:15.155 --> 00:24:17.363
What? It's mostly grass, right?

537
00:24:19.988 --> 00:24:22.655
<i>Attention Earthquakes,
a reminder to buy your prom tickets,</i>


538
00:24:22.738 --> 00:24:26.071
<i>where the dance team will be performing
their annual dance presentation.</i>


539
00:24:26.155 --> 00:24:29.405
<i>A tradition I still don't understand,
but it's the committee's decision,</i>


540
00:24:29.488 --> 00:24:30.613
<i>and I support them.</i>

541
00:24:30.696 --> 00:24:33.196
...instead of starting in Portugal,
we start in Amsterdam.


542
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.946
Uh, Kweller, can we maybe do this later?
I have a French quiz.


543
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.030
These are the best fares
I've seen in months.


544
00:24:38.113 --> 00:24:39.946
Just, um, give me your phone.

545
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.988
- What's wrong with yours?
- Really?


546
00:24:42.905 --> 00:24:45.780
Your aversion to technology
is becoming a character flaw.


547
00:24:45.863 --> 00:24:46.863
Hey, guys.

548
00:24:47.196 --> 00:24:49.738
Uh... hey?

549
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:51.738
I wanted to say thank you
for this morning.


550
00:24:51.821 --> 00:24:54.446
My butt is so sore. 
I could barely walk.

551
00:24:55.071 --> 00:24:56.071
Things got messy.

552
00:24:56.155 --> 00:24:58.071
Uh, context, please?

553
00:24:58.155 --> 00:25:00.363
- I gave her a riding lesson.
- I bet you did.


554
00:25:00.446 --> 00:25:02.113
Horse riding.

555
00:25:02.196 --> 00:25:03.655
- Mm-hmm.
- Part of one, anyway.


556
00:25:03.738 --> 00:25:07.405
And as a way of saying thanks,
there is a karaoke party this Saturday


557
00:25:07.488 --> 00:25:11.113
at my friend Quinn's house,
and I was hoping you guys could come.


558
00:25:11.196 --> 00:25:13.988
- Uh, yeah. Um, I don't... I don't...
- We'll be there.


559
00:25:14.071 --> 00:25:18.321
Perfect. So Cameron,
should I like, SMS you the address?


560
00:25:18.405 --> 00:25:20.321
Kweller's phone is
an antiquated piece of crap.


561
00:25:20.405 --> 00:25:22.821
- Why don't you send it to me?
- Awesome. Okay.


562
00:25:22.905 --> 00:25:25.488
- Okay, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Totally.


563
00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:27.488
What the hell?

564
00:25:27.571 --> 00:25:30.905
You've been talking about wanting
to go on all these exotic adventures.


565
00:25:30.988 --> 00:25:34.696
Why don't you just think of this
as an adventure close to home.


566
00:25:43.113 --> 00:25:45.071
That was fun.

Oh, wow. It's a pool party.

571
00:25:57.113 --> 00:26:00.238
- Why didn't you tell me?
- 'Cause nobody told me.


572
00:26:01.155 --> 00:26:02.738
What are we even doing here?

573
00:26:02.821 --> 00:26:04.905
- You know. Come on.
- Wh... wh... wh... Whoa!


574
00:26:04.988 --> 00:26:08.488
Eating free Pizza Hut is what we're doing.

575
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:10.821
Besides, when do you get
to make fun of these guys


576
00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:12.905
in their own natural habitat?

577
00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:14.988
- That's true.
- I mean, exhibit A.


578
00:26:15.071 --> 00:26:16.780

582
00:26:23.363 --> 00:26:25.405
but for some reason,
they're happy about it.


583
00:26:25.488 --> 00:26:28.738
- Great! You guys came.
- Yes, we did.


584
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:31.613
Yeah. This is cool. 
You do this often?

585
00:26:31.696 --> 00:26:34.571
It's kind of a pre-prom thing,
so we can work on our tans.


586
00:26:34.655 --> 00:26:38.155
But I'm going to college in New York,
so won't be doing this next year.


587
00:26:38.238 --> 00:26:39.613
- Where you guys going?
- Uh, yeah.


588
00:26:39.696 --> 00:26:41.905
I'm kind of opting out
of that whole thing.


589
00:26:41.988 --> 00:26:43.280
Oh, like a gap year?

590
00:26:43.363 --> 00:26:47.155
Yes, exactly like a gap year,
followed by another gap year,


591
00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:48.238
and then a gap life.

592
00:26:48.321 --> 00:26:50.363
- Kweller doesn't believe in college.
- Really?


593
00:26:50.446 --> 00:26:54.196
Well, I believe it exists. I just think
it's a huge waste of time and money.


594
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.488
So, any idea what you're gonna sing?
Everybody's got their go-to karaoke song.


595
00:26:58.571 --> 00:26:59.571
- Right?
- No.


596
00:27:00.613 --> 00:27:03.571
Lemme guess. You're gonna opt out
of the whole singing thing too?

Cameron was in the Glee Club. What?

670
00:30:04.696 --> 00:30:08.196
- I didn't know it was a secret.
- Glee Club? At Cali?


671

- No, no.
- I didn't think Cali had...


672
00:30:10.238 --> 00:30:12.488
It was at my
old school back in Wyoming.

673
00:30:12.571 --> 00:30:15.280
It was either play football
or cow tipping.

- Or Glee Club. Yeah.
- Or Glee Club?


675
00:30:17.863 --> 00:30:19.655
I get it. Oh, this is me.

676
00:30:23.405 --> 00:30:25.530
This is you? My cousin lives here.

677
00:30:25.613 --> 00:30:28.613
- Her name's Kaia Mehan. She's a junior...
- We're new here.


678
00:30:28.696 --> 00:30:31.988
So we haven't really met anyone yet,
but, um, thanks for the ride.


679
00:30:32.071 --> 00:30:34.196
And thanks for coming today.

680
00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.238
I hope it wasn't too, you know, weird.

681
00:30:38.321 --> 00:30:40.280
That's okay. Weird's totally our thing.

682
00:30:40.363 --> 00:30:42.821
- Okay, then. See you later.
- See ya.


683
00:30:42.905 --> 00:30:44.613
- Hey, Padge.
- Yeah?


684
00:30:44.696 --> 00:30:47.113
I gotta say,
even though you're incredibly hot,


685
00:30:47.196 --> 00:30:49.988
you're not the complete monster
that I thought you'd be.


686
00:30:50.071 --> 00:30:51.405
Uh, thanks?

687
00:30:51.488 --> 00:30:53.905
But Cameron is like a brother to me.

688
00:30:53.988 --> 00:30:57.780
So, I have to say,
if you do anything to hurt him,


689
00:30:57.863 --> 00:31:00.780
I'll put a croquembouche
in your croquem-face. You feel me?

Uh, okay.

696
00:31:13.613 --> 00:31:16.238

697
00:31:16.821 --> 00:31:17.988

00:31:26.155 --> 00:31:29.696
Why didn't you tell me
you had a date with Padgett Sawyer?


701
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.363
Trust me. It wasn't a date.
The whole thing was a freakish aberration.


702

of your league is spending time with you.

Ooh, go on.

721
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.280
I'm gonna make him more popular

Yeah, it's no problem.

727
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.946
Since I'm already here,
I was wondering if...


728
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.905
- What's all this stuff?
- Uh, it's from Dad. Just got here.


729
00:32:46.988 --> 00:32:48.530
Uh, great.

730
00:32:48.613 --> 00:32:51.488
- Gifts? What's the occasion?
- Nothing. It's stupid.


731
00:32:51.571 --> 00:32:55.530
Our dad lives in Sweden, and once a year,
he sends us these all-in-one presents.


732
00:32:55.613 --> 00:32:59.071
Kind of like Christmas and Hanukkah
and our birthdays all smushed together.


733
00:32:59.155 --> 00:33:00.321
Seriously?

734
00:33:00.405 --> 00:33:01.405
A doorstop?

735
00:33:01.488 --> 00:33:06.863
Hmm, coloring books, Legos,
and Swedish Helga Barbie.


736
00:33:06.946 --> 00:33:08.988
Quite a haul if you're eight.

737
00:33:09.071 --> 00:33:11.071
- At least he's trying.
- I disagree.


738
00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:13.696
Well, it's the thought that counts, right?

739
00:33:14.738 --> 00:33:18.113
- Not that it's my business.
- Um, did you need something else?


740
00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:21.321
Actually, yeah. I was hoping
you could give me another riding lesson.


741
00:33:22.071 --> 00:33:23.280
- When?
- Now?


742
00:33:23.363 --> 00:33:24.446
Now?

743
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.738
Um, yeah. You're in luck.
I was on my way to the...


744
00:33:27.821 --> 00:33:31.238
Hey, I thought you were gonna watch
the <i>Blue Bloods</i> marathon with me.


745
00:33:31.321 --> 00:33:34.655
- Sorry, Grandma. Um, I...
- That's okay. I'll get started without ya.


746
00:33:34.738 --> 00:33:38.155
Tommy Selleck waits for no one.

747
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:40.530
We better go.

748
00:33:41.321 --> 00:33:42.780
Bye, guys.

749
00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:46.214
I'm getting the hang of this, huh?

750
00:33:47.196 --> 00:33:49.196
Just takes
time and practice, that's all.


751
00:33:49.238 --> 00:33:51.155
Everyone's always in a hurry.

752
00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:54.655
- Oh, and you aren't?
- What's that supposed to mean?


753
00:33:55.196 --> 00:33:58.030
I don't know. It seems like you can't wait
to be done with high school.


754
00:33:58.613 --> 00:34:00.196
Yeah, that's true.

755
00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.446
I used to be like that too,
but now that I lost my sponsorship,


756
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.655
I, um, don't even know
if I'll be able to pay for college.


757
00:34:07.738 --> 00:34:09.113
Man, that sucks.

758
00:34:09.196 --> 00:34:12.030
I'm sorry, but it won't take much money
for me to bum around.


759
00:34:12.113 --> 00:34:16.030
See as much of the world as I can.
Take as many pictures as I can.


760
00:34:16.113 --> 00:34:18.155
That actually sounds amazing.

761
00:34:18.238 --> 00:34:20.071
I would love to travel someday.

762
00:34:20.155 --> 00:34:21.905
I always wanted to see Paris.

763
00:34:21.988 --> 00:34:24.155
You mean, you wanna
take pictures of yourself in Paris


764
00:34:24.238 --> 00:34:25.988
so your followers know you went there?

765
00:34:26.071 --> 00:34:29.363
Should I just do what you do
and take rolls and rolls of pictures


766
00:34:29.446 --> 00:34:30.446
and never show anyone?

767
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.113
Wait.

768
00:34:32.196 --> 00:34:33.863
- How do you know...
- Brin told me.


769
00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:37.696
You know, no one would have
ever heard of Diane Arbus or Ansel Adams


770
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.571
if they hid in
their dark room all day.

771
00:34:39.655 --> 00:34:40.821
Huh.

772
00:34:40.905 --> 00:34:41.905
What?

773
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:44.571
I can't believe
you actually know those names.


774
00:34:44.655 --> 00:34:46.863
So, how about it?

775
00:34:46.946 --> 00:34:48.780
- How about what?
- Your pictures.


776
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.363
- When do I get to see them?
- Uh, I'm thinking never.


777
00:34:52.446 --> 00:34:56.030
Oh, come on. You show me yours,
and I'll show you mine.


778
00:34:56.113 --> 00:34:57.613
Oh, everyone has seen yours.

779
00:34:58.738 --> 00:35:01.696
Sorry, that came out way dirtier
than I intended it to.


780
00:35:03.071 --> 00:35:05.113
Uh, I'm just really private, that's all.

781
00:35:05.196 --> 00:35:07.821
But, um...
if you really wanna see what I do...


782
00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:08.905
Yes.

783
00:35:09.405 --> 00:35:10.405
Okay.

784
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:13.780
So you've really never been
to Union Station?


785
00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:16.571
Honestly, I didn't even know
this was here.


786
00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:17.780
Is that terrible?

787
00:35:17.863 --> 00:35:20.446
Uh, yeah, kind of.

788
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.571
It's like a classic,
old-timey train station.


789
00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:26.488
Well, it's actually
a working train station


790
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:28.113
where people take trains.

791
00:35:32.738 --> 00:35:35.988
Then again, you don't strike me
as the public-transportation type.


792
00:35:36.071 --> 00:35:37.446
I carpool to school.

793
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.030
In your friend's Lexus.

794
00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:41.238
Hey, Mr. Cahill.

795
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.363
- Hey, Cam.
- This place is amazing.


796
00:35:43.946 --> 00:35:46.696
I guess I never come downtown
because it's always so crowded.


797
00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.155
With street photography, crowds are
the point. Makes it easier to blend in.


798
00:35:50.238 --> 00:35:52.405
People don't mind you
just taking their picture?


799
00:35:52.488 --> 00:35:53.821
Uh, well, it depends.

800
00:35:53.905 --> 00:35:55.905
Sometimes I ask permission,
sometimes I don't.


801
00:35:55.988 --> 00:35:59.696
But after a while, you kind of develop
a sense of when it's okay to shoot.


802
00:36:04.488 --> 00:36:05.946
And when to run.

803
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.696
- Thanks, Gene. Here you go.
- Mm.


804
00:36:10.196 --> 00:36:12.780
Gene's Nutella lattes are insane.

805
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:17.196
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.


806
00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.571
Wait, are you actually smiling?

807
00:36:20.155 --> 00:36:21.238
What?

808
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:23.738
I don't know.
I've just never seen you like this.


809
00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:24.946
What do you mean?

810
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:31.238
Well, at school,
you're this really reserved person,


811
00:36:31.321 --> 00:36:34.988
but at the stables
or here with your camera...


812
00:36:35.071 --> 00:36:37.113
Oh, maybe it's because

813
00:36:37.196 --> 00:36:39.696
no one in those places
ever keyed the word "loser"


814
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.863
into my truck door
or put a fetal pig in my backpack.


815
00:36:43.363 --> 00:36:44.363
Ouch.

816
00:36:44.446 --> 00:36:45.530
Yeah.

817
00:36:45.613 --> 00:36:46.905
It doesn't matter.

818
00:36:46.988 --> 00:36:50.488
High school's a bunch of scared people
pretending to be something they're not.


819
00:36:50.571 --> 00:36:53.196
But this place?

820
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.655
This place is real.

821
00:36:55.655 --> 00:36:56.738
Just like horses.

822
00:36:56.821 --> 00:36:59.655
Best bullshit detectors
in the entire animal kingdom.


823
00:36:59.738 --> 00:37:01.238
So what about Gilly?

824
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:05.446
- Does he think I'm full of crap?
- You think I'd be here with you if he did?


825
00:37:07.738 --> 00:37:10.238
Sorry things are so
bad for you at school.

826
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:12.946
Guess I'd be in
a hurry to graduate too.

827
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.030
Yeah, I'm only doing it
so my grandmother doesn't freak out.


828
00:37:16.113 --> 00:37:18.488
Yeah, why do you
and Brin live with her?

829
00:37:18.571 --> 00:37:20.071
Sorry, if that's...

830
00:37:20.155 --> 00:37:21.613
No, no, no. No, it's okay.

831
00:37:21.696 --> 00:37:24.613
Well, you know our father lives in Sweden.

832
00:37:24.696 --> 00:37:26.238
- His choice.
- Mm-hmm.


833
00:37:26.321 --> 00:37:28.363
And after our mom died and...

834
00:37:28.446 --> 00:37:31.280
Oh, I am so sorry.

835
00:37:31.363 --> 00:37:34.196
Yeah, it's four years ago.
Plane crash.


836
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.446
She was dating this guy named Marcus,
who flew a turboprop.


837
00:37:39.321 --> 00:37:43.238
And one Saturday morning,
they were on their way back from Laramie,


838
00:37:44.738 --> 00:37:46.280
and, um...

839
00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.280
You must miss her a lot.

840
00:37:49.446 --> 00:37:50.905
Yeah, Mom was awesome.

841
00:37:52.738 --> 00:37:55.988
In fact, she is the one
who gave me this camera.


842
00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:58.071
So that's why you love it so much.

843
00:37:58.155 --> 00:38:00.571
Yeah. So what about your family?

844
00:38:00.655 --> 00:38:02.821
Well, my parents are divorced.

845
00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:04.238
Okay.

846
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:08.446
Um, my dad lives in Florida
with his new family.


847
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.530
And I'm here with my mom.

848
00:38:10.613 --> 00:38:14.155
- Okay, what does she do?
- She's a nurse.


849
00:38:14.238 --> 00:38:15.155
Hmm.

850
00:38:15.238 --> 00:38:16.998
I've never told anyone that before.

851
00:38:17.071 --> 00:38:20.988
She works her ass off
to give me every opportunity in the world.


852
00:38:21.488 --> 00:38:25.238
And sometimes I'm scared
I won't be able to make it up to her.


853
00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:28.363
Hey, did I say you could do that?

854
00:38:28.446 --> 00:38:30.363
No. That's the whole idea
of a candid shot.


855
00:38:30.446 --> 00:38:34.196
If you know I'm going to take a photo,
then you gotta fix your hair,


856
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.071
and you do that whole duck-face thing.

857
00:38:36.155 --> 00:38:38.446
Yes. That's exactly it.

858
00:38:45.321 --> 00:38:47.363
Is... that an emergency?

859
00:38:47.446 --> 00:38:49.238
Uh... sorry.

860
00:38:49.738 --> 00:38:50.946
Uh, depends.

861
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.696
- Are you free next weekend?
- Why?


862
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.155
It's my friend Alden's birthday,
and she's having a theme party.


863
00:38:56.238 --> 00:38:57.738
Okay, what's the theme?

864
00:38:57.821 --> 00:39:00.238
It's Drop it like F. Scott.
It's a <i>Great Gatsby</i>thing.


865
00:39:00.321 --> 00:39:02.238
Yeah, she does realize
those parties in the book


866
00:39:02.321 --> 00:39:04.446
represent the shallowness
of the ruling class, right?


867
00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:05.821
Sadly, that is the appeal.

868
00:39:05.905 --> 00:39:07.821
- Okay.
- So what do you think?


869
00:39:07.905 --> 00:39:09.922
- You down to get bougie together?
- Yeah.


870
00:39:09.946 --> 00:39:11.405
Can I bring some people?

871
00:39:11.488 --> 00:39:13.571
Sure. Yeah.
Bring whoever you want.


872
00:39:13.655 --> 00:39:14.946
Oh my God! Oh my God!

873
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.988
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I have the best brother ever.


874
00:39:18.071 --> 00:39:19.863
He has his moments.

875
00:39:19.946 --> 00:39:21.905
Okay. It's a roaring '20s theme,

876
00:39:21.988 --> 00:39:24.071
so there's a million ways
we can go with this.


877
00:39:24.155 --> 00:39:27.071
Yeah, but we're
only gonna try like, three, right?


878
00:39:27.155 --> 00:39:28.571
Don't listen to him.

879
00:39:28.655 --> 00:39:31.280
He's been wearing
the same three plaids since 2017?


880
00:39:31.363 --> 00:39:32.780
At least I alternate.

881
00:39:32.863 --> 00:39:33.905
I get it.

882
00:39:33.988 --> 00:39:36.655
You found a look that works,
but like I tell my followers,


883
00:39:36.738 --> 00:39:39.238
sometimes bold can be your bestie.

884
00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.780
You actually say that?
Out loud? To people?


885
00:39:43.863 --> 00:39:44.863
Come on.

886
00:39:45.613 --> 00:39:46.613
Ugh.

887
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.821

900
00:40:28.155 --> 00:40:30.780
Okay, now don't tell me
that wasn't fun.


901
00:40:30.863 --> 00:40:31.863
It wasn't.

902
00:40:32.446 --> 00:40:33.821
Okay, fine, it wasn't terrible.

903
00:40:33.905 --> 00:40:36.321
But it's somewhere between
getting my wisdom teeth out


904
00:40:36.405 --> 00:40:38.155
and that Harry Styles show last year.

905
00:40:38.238 --> 00:40:41.988
- Wait, you saw Harry Styles?
- He took me for my birthday.


906
00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:43.905
Aw, that's so sweet.

907
00:40:43.988 --> 00:40:45.363
Okay. The point is,

908
00:40:45.446 --> 00:40:47.780
we got our clothes,
and we're done now, right?


909
00:40:48.488 --> 00:40:49.613
Um...

910
00:40:50.363 --> 00:40:51.363
Oh God, what now?

911
00:40:52.071 --> 00:40:53.738
You're absolutely sure this is necessary?

912
00:40:53.821 --> 00:40:56.405
Well, we want to complete the look, right?

913
00:40:56.488 --> 00:40:59.155
- Oh, definitely.
- Out. Now.


914
00:40:59.238 --> 00:41:01.071
- Fine.
- Okay.


915
00:41:01.155 --> 00:41:04.613
The most important thing
for you to do now is trust me.


916
00:41:04.696 --> 00:41:05.905
You've done this before?

917
00:41:05.988 --> 00:41:07.530
Literally thousands of times.

918
00:41:07.613 --> 00:41:09.363
Really? You shaved a guy's face?

919
00:41:09.446 --> 00:41:11.405
Sorry, can't hear you.

920
00:41:33.155 --> 00:41:36.238
I can't believe you got him to do this.
He must really like you.


921
00:41:36.321 --> 00:41:39.196
Uh, no, no. I'm just really persuasive.

922
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.405
- How's it going in there?
- It's kind of hard to say.


923
00:41:42.488 --> 00:41:44.363
Oh, come on. Just come out.

924
00:41:44.446 --> 00:41:45.321
Okay.

925
00:41:46.863 --> 00:41:49.238
<i>♪ I love to love ♪</i>

926
00:41:50.238 --> 00:41:53.530
<i>♪ I love to love,

927
00:41:53.613 --> 00:41:56.863
<i>♪ I feel so much,

00:41:56.946 --> 00:42:00.280

00:42:00.363 --> 00:42:02.030

930
00:42:02.113 --> 00:42:04.238
Wow, you <i>are</i> good.

931
00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:05.780
How do you feel?

932
00:42:05.863 --> 00:42:07.905
Like I just lost <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.

933
00:42:08.488 --> 00:42:10.780
Well, if I didn't know any better,

934
00:42:10.863 --> 00:42:12.696
and you weren't my brother,

935
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.196
I'd say you look pretty hot.

936
00:42:15.696 --> 00:42:16.696
Right, Padgett?

937
00:42:17.196 --> 00:42:19.155
Uh... yeah.

938
00:42:19.238 --> 00:42:20.446
Sure.

939
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:28.030
Very subtle.

940
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:30.030
Wow.

941
00:42:30.113 --> 00:42:31.738
Your camera? Really?

942
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.280
This is the only time
I'm gonna be doing something like this.


943
00:42:35.363 --> 00:42:38.405
- Might as well document it.
- Hey, everybody. Padgett Head to Toe here.


944
00:42:38.488 --> 00:42:41.405
Outside of Alden Pierce's

945
00:42:41.488 --> 00:42:45.113
If you can't already tell,
the theme is Drop It Like F. Scott.


946
00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:47.405
I'm here with my amazing new friends.

947
00:42:47.488 --> 00:42:48.488
Cameron.

948
00:42:49.405 --> 00:42:50.863
- Brin.
- Hi, guys.


949
00:42:50.946 --> 00:42:52.030
And Nisha.

950
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:07.780
This is insane.

951
00:43:07.863 --> 00:43:09.821
You're hot now. 
Get used to it.

952
00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:12.696
Uh, no, I was talking about the party.

953
00:43:25.988 --> 00:43:28.155
This one's teeny compared to her sweet 16.

954
00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:29.446
We went to the beach.

955
00:43:29.988 --> 00:43:31.780
In Turks and Caicos.

956
00:43:31.863 --> 00:43:34.155
Can you believe this?

957
00:43:34.238 --> 00:43:36.363
- Padge!
- Hey! Mwah, mwah.


958
00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.613
Hi. I'm Alden.

959
00:43:40.196 --> 00:43:41.071
Birthday girl.

960
00:43:41.155 --> 00:43:42.280
Yeah, we've met.

961
00:43:42.363 --> 00:43:43.363
Oh.

962
00:43:43.946 --> 00:43:44.780
Oh!

963
00:43:44.863 --> 00:43:48.363
I'm sorry, I gotta ask.
What are you drinking?


964
00:43:48.446 --> 00:43:50.863
Oh, it's my signature bday mocktail.

965
00:43:50.946 --> 00:43:54.821
It's got cranberry juice,
fresh raspberries, cherry Pop Rocks.


966
00:43:54.905 --> 00:43:59.446
Hi, I just wanted to say happy birthday
and thank you so much for inviting me.


967
00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:01.196
I'm sorry. Who are you?

968
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.196
Uh, Brin Kweller.

969
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.155
- I thought I was in...
- Hey, uh...


970
00:44:04.238 --> 00:44:07.946
We're gonna go get some drinks,
and we'll see you guys in a bit.


971
00:44:08.738 --> 00:44:09.655
Bye.

972
00:44:09.738 --> 00:44:13.613
Padge, I don't know what you did
to that Cameron guy, but damn!


973
00:44:13.696 --> 00:44:15.030
What you did?

974
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:18.030
Oh, she means his costume.

975
00:44:18.113 --> 00:44:19.821
And Cameron did that himself.

976
00:44:20.821 --> 00:44:23.155
Wow, you might
just win this bet after all.


977
00:44:23.238 --> 00:44:24.905
Yeah, if you don't
blow it for me first.

978
00:44:24.988 --> 00:44:27.655
- Guess we'll see who's gonna be a loser.
- We'll see.


979
00:44:27.738 --> 00:44:30.071
So, Aniston just bailed on you, bro?

980
00:44:30.696 --> 00:44:31.696
Yeah, bro.

981
00:44:32.488 --> 00:44:35.946
I was on my way to pick her up,
and she texted me and said it's over.


982
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:39.238
Said she's going to Brent Rivera's
birthday party with that other dude.


983
00:44:39.321 --> 00:44:40.863
That sucks, bro.

984
00:44:40.946 --> 00:44:43.655
That Aniston chick was hot.
If I were you, I'd be crying too.


985
00:44:43.738 --> 00:44:47.196
That's okay.
My fans love my vulnerability.


986
00:44:49.988 --> 00:44:52.280
- Wait, you guys aren't recording?
- Oh!


987
00:44:52.363 --> 00:44:53.988
- Shoot, my bad.
- Oh my God.


988
00:44:54.071 --> 00:44:56.113
Guys! All right, come on.
I need another take.


989
00:44:56.196 --> 00:44:57.363
Okay. You got this.

990
00:45:00.405 --> 00:45:03.488
Damn, I lost it.
Always be recording.


991
00:45:03.571 --> 00:45:05.321
- My bad. That was my fault.
- All right?


992
00:45:05.821 --> 00:45:08.488
I still can't believe she'd ditch me
for some rando loser


993
00:45:08.571 --> 00:45:10.863
who's only got 318,000 followers.

994
00:45:10.946 --> 00:45:12.613
Well, he does play for the Clippers.

995
00:45:15.196 --> 00:45:16.613
Yeah, that's pretty dope.

996
00:45:30.238 --> 00:45:32.821
Don't tell me
you're actually having fun.


997
00:45:32.905 --> 00:45:34.488
Why would you say that?

998
00:45:34.571 --> 00:45:36.363
This party is ridiculous.

999
00:45:36.446 --> 00:45:39.696
You're having fun.
You're having fun.


1000
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.113
Maybe a little.

1001
00:45:42.155 --> 00:45:43.196
Hey.

1002
00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.488
Nice costume.

1003
00:45:45.071 --> 00:45:47.571
Didn't think I'd see
another Jordan Baker.


1004
00:45:47.655 --> 00:45:49.821
Daisy is so overrated.

1005
00:45:49.905 --> 00:45:50.905
Totally.

1006
00:45:51.405 --> 00:45:55.405
Wow. I look like
the before picture for you.


1007
00:45:55.488 --> 00:45:56.905
Stop. You look great.

1008
00:45:57.863 --> 00:45:59.905
You were at my karaoke party.

1009
00:45:59.988 --> 00:46:03.071
Right. I was the one
who didn't bring their swimsuit.


1010
00:46:03.155 --> 00:46:06.738
- Yeah. I'm sorry it turned weird.
- It's okay. Weird's totally my thing.


1011
00:46:08.363 --> 00:46:09.905
Oh my God.

1012
00:46:09.988 --> 00:46:12.196
They put them in the ice too?

1013
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.488
Come on. I know where Alden keeps
her non-Pop-Rock-aholic drinks.


1014
00:46:15.571 --> 00:46:16.946
- Thank you.
- Let's go.


1015
00:46:18.155 --> 00:46:19.363
Hey, you.

1016
00:46:20.738 --> 00:46:22.905
Whoa, whoa.
You're not even gonna say, "Hey"?


1017
00:46:22.988 --> 00:46:23.863
Blow me.

1018
00:46:23.946 --> 00:46:25.530
You're Aniston's problem now.

1019
00:46:25.613 --> 00:46:28.655
You're still mad about that?
That was like, two weeks ago.


1020
00:46:29.613 --> 00:46:31.530
- Hey.
- Dude! What the hell?


1021
00:46:31.613 --> 00:46:33.333
I'm sorry.
I had something else to tell you.


1022
00:46:33.405 --> 00:46:34.780
- What?
- I don't know.


1023
00:46:34.863 --> 00:46:36.488
That... I'm sorry.

1024
00:46:37.071 --> 00:46:39.113
And that she was right.

1025
00:46:39.571 --> 00:46:40.696
- Who?
- Aniston.


1026
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.571
She said that I wasn't over you,

1027
00:46:43.655 --> 00:46:46.905
and... that's the truth.

1028
00:46:47.696 --> 00:46:49.280
We belong together, Padge.

1029
00:46:49.905 --> 00:46:52.863
Now, come on. These nominations
are on Monday, all right?


1030
00:46:52.946 --> 00:46:56.071
If we win prom king and queen,
our followers would go crazy.


1031
00:46:56.155 --> 00:46:57.155
I don't care!

1032
00:46:58.363 --> 00:47:01.821
Oh, and by the way,
there are no mean streets of Pali.


1033
00:47:01.905 --> 00:47:04.280
You live on the same block
as Gwyneth Paltrow.


1034
00:47:05.196 --> 00:47:09.696
Oh man! You spilled my watermelon.
It was the last one.


1035
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.238
Now, all they have is mango.

1036
00:47:11.321 --> 00:47:14.071
I hate mango. It's a terrible flavor.

1037
00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:15.780
Hey.

1038
00:47:16.405 --> 00:47:17.863
Is everything okay?

1039
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:22.530
Yeah. Yeah, I just, uh, spilled my drink.

1040
00:47:22.613 --> 00:47:26.071
But I was thinking about going
to get another one, though.


1041
00:47:27.196 --> 00:47:29.738
Any chance you want to come with me?

1042
00:47:30.738 --> 00:47:31.946
Sure.

1043
00:47:32.863 --> 00:47:33.863
Let's go.

1044
00:47:37.655 --> 00:47:41.321
Okay, enough pictures for you.
No one's going to see them anyways.


1045
00:47:41.405 --> 00:47:43.071
I have a better idea. Come on.

1046
00:47:43.155 --> 00:47:45.280
Oh, photo booth? Seriously?

1047
00:47:45.363 --> 00:47:47.863
- Come on. I want to see your duck face.
- Ugh.


1048
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:50.696
Now show me what you got.

1049
00:47:53.821 --> 00:47:55.363
You're not supposed to look at me.

1050
00:47:55.446 --> 00:47:56.905
- You're supposed to pose.
- Sorry.


1051
00:47:56.988 --> 00:48:01.155
I guess I'm just mesmerized
by watching you disfigure yourself.


1052
00:48:01.238 --> 00:48:02.738
So you're repulsed?

1053
00:48:02.821 --> 00:48:06.030
Totally, but it must be so hard
to make yourself look terrible


1054
00:48:06.113 --> 00:48:08.196
when you're naturally so, you know...

1055
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.280
What?

1056
00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:11.821
Beautiful.

1057
00:48:15.071 --> 00:48:17.738
All right, everyone,
let's gather by the big cake


1058
00:48:17.821 --> 00:48:19.863
to sing Alden "Happy Birthday."

1059
00:48:19.946 --> 00:48:23.238
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1060
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:24.155
Stop it.

1061
00:48:24.238 --> 00:48:26.530
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday ♪</i>
- Ow!


1062
00:48:26.613 --> 00:48:28.571
<i>- ♪ To you ♪</i>
- Get away from me, asshole!


1063
00:48:28.655 --> 00:48:30.863
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday... ♪</i>
- Hey, Brin, what's going on?


1064
00:48:30.946 --> 00:48:32.863
Why are you making a
big deal out of this?

1065
00:48:32.946 --> 00:48:34.821
- It was nothing.
- You call that nothing?


1066
00:48:34.905 --> 00:48:37.238
- What happened? What did he do?
- She's so overreacting.


1067
00:48:37.321 --> 00:48:39.530
- You, shut up.
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.


1068
00:48:39.613 --> 00:48:40.780
So I said, "Okay."

1069
00:48:40.863 --> 00:48:43.613
And then we went into this big room
with a pool table.


1070
00:48:43.696 --> 00:48:46.363
- And we were just kissing.
- See? No big deal.


1071
00:48:46.488 --> 00:48:49.821
But then he started going for more,
so I bonked him with a pool ball.


1072
00:48:49.905 --> 00:48:52.321
- Which hurt, by the way.
- Freaking piece of shit.


1073
00:48:52.405 --> 00:48:55.780
- Don't tell me she's your girlfriend?
- No, she's my little sister, you idiot.


1074
00:48:55.863 --> 00:48:57.655
And if you ever touch her again...

1075
00:48:57.738 --> 00:48:59.613
What, you wanna go? 
You wanna go, man?

1076
00:48:59.696 --> 00:49:03.405
- Let's go. Let's get it.
- Why'd you just take off your shirt?


1077
00:49:04.905 --> 00:49:07.821
I don't know. That's for me to know
and for you to find out.


1078
00:49:08.655 --> 00:49:10.363
- What?
- No, Cameron, come on.


1079
00:49:10.446 --> 00:49:12.030
He is not worth it.

1080
00:49:13.071 --> 00:49:15.030
No, not this time.

1081
00:49:16.363 --> 00:49:19.155
- Cameron, please.
- Move back. Make some room.


1082
00:49:19.238 --> 00:49:20.696
You got it! You got it!

1083
00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.530
If you ever go near my sister again...

1084
00:49:22.613 --> 00:49:23.655
- What?
- Ooh!


1085
00:49:23.738 --> 00:49:25.780
Haha. Okay, okay.

1086
00:49:27.696 --> 00:49:29.655
Oh!

1087
00:49:30.738 --> 00:49:32.405
Oh!

1088
00:49:33.488 --> 00:49:35.030
- Yes!
- Oh!


1089
00:49:35.113 --> 00:49:36.821
Classic Johnny Wang move.

1090
00:49:36.905 --> 00:49:38.113
What the hell was that?

1091
00:49:38.196 --> 00:49:40.155
I'm sure that was me kicking your ass.

1092
00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:51.863
Cameron, enough!

1093
00:49:51.946 --> 00:49:54.613
- Back in there, bro.
- Well, check out Captain Badass.


1094
00:49:54.696 --> 00:49:56.655
I dare you to try that again.

1095
00:50:03.113 --> 00:50:04.196
Ah!

1096
00:50:06.321 --> 00:50:08.030
Yes!

1097
00:50:08.988 --> 00:50:10.405
I wasn't ready for that!

1098
00:50:10.905 --> 00:50:13.405
- I need another take. Stop cheering!
- Are you okay?


1099
00:50:13.488 --> 00:50:14.780
Cameron, that was amazing.

1100
00:50:14.863 --> 00:50:16.738
- Let's go get the truck.
- Okay.


1101
00:50:16.821 --> 00:50:19.280
- Okay?
- Wait, you're not leaving, are you?


1102
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:22.405
Yeah, I think you should,
but don't forget your camera.


1103
00:50:22.905 --> 00:50:23.988
No, no, no, no!

1104
00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:25.863
Oh!

1105
00:50:25.946 --> 00:50:28.446
- Happy...
- Not now, Mom and Dad!


1106
00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:31.613
Cameron, are you okay?
Let me help.


1107
00:50:33.571 --> 00:50:34.780
Cameron.

1108
00:50:36.363 --> 00:50:37.363
Cameron.

1109
00:50:38.238 --> 00:50:40.571
- Cameron, wait.
- What do you want?


1110
00:50:40.655 --> 00:50:42.655
To make sure you're okay.
You were leaving.


1111
00:50:42.738 --> 00:50:45.196
An asshole hit on my sister
and ruined my mother's camera.


1112
00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.488
What do you want me to do?

1113
00:50:46.571 --> 00:50:49.780
The way you stood up to Jordan back there,
people were impressed.


1114
00:50:49.863 --> 00:50:52.655
Who? The... the... the valedictorian?
The head cheerleader?


1115
00:50:52.738 --> 00:50:56.030
- The captain of the lacrosse team?
- Cali doesn't have a lacrosse...


1116
00:50:56.113 --> 00:50:58.030
What am I doing here, Padgett?

1117
00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:01.530
I mean, why after four years
did you suddenly start talking to me?


1118
00:51:02.113 --> 00:51:03.113
I... I don't know.

1119
00:51:03.863 --> 00:51:07.321
Maybe I just sensed there was more to you
than what you let everyone see.


1120
00:51:07.405 --> 00:51:08.780
What if I like it that way?

1121
00:51:09.571 --> 00:51:11.946
Well, then that really breaks my heart.

1122
00:51:15.613 --> 00:51:16.613
Cameron, please.

1123
00:51:16.696 --> 00:51:18.113
Broken heart, huh?

1124
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.738
Looks like someone
moved on from Jordan pretty quick.


1125
00:51:21.821 --> 00:51:24.405
I moved on from Jordan
the second we walked into that trailer.


1126
00:51:24.488 --> 00:51:27.155
And now you're falling
for our little project?


1127
00:51:27.238 --> 00:51:28.863
It's not like that.

1128
00:51:28.946 --> 00:51:32.196
I'm worried about him, okay?
That's all. You saw what happened.


1129
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.405
You mean, your plus-three freak parade
who ruined my birthday?


1130
00:51:35.488 --> 00:51:37.113
Yeah, it was hard to miss.

1131
00:51:37.196 --> 00:51:40.280
Look, if you wanna welch
on our bet now, I understand.


1132
00:51:40.863 --> 00:51:43.047
I mean, the guy's a bigger train wreck
than we expected.


1133
00:51:43.071 --> 00:51:44.071
No.

1134
00:51:44.655 --> 00:51:45.655
We're still on.

1135
00:51:57.155 --> 00:51:58.780
<i>Arm code.</i>

1136
00:52:14.863 --> 00:52:15.780
Great party.

1137
00:52:15.863 --> 00:52:18.696
Thanks,
but it's kind of been over for a while.


1138
00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:21.821
No party's over until I say it's over.

1139
00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:24.196
Come on, Cali High. Let's rock!

1140
00:52:26.446 --> 00:52:27.446
Oh.

1141
00:52:27.946 --> 00:52:29.071
- It <i>is</i>over.
- Yeah.


1142
00:52:30.196 --> 00:52:31.405
Where's my shirt?

1143
00:52:32.321 --> 00:52:33.363
Who needs shirts?

1144
00:52:36.988 --> 00:52:38.113
Okay.

1145
00:52:57.238 --> 00:52:58.321
Hey, guys.

1146
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:03.780
So the rest of
tonight didn't go so great.

1147
00:53:04.696 --> 00:53:07.655
Well, it started out fun.

1148
00:53:08.238 --> 00:53:11.905
You know, I talk a lot here
about self-improvement.


1149
00:53:12.821 --> 00:53:14.238
Your looks,

1150
00:53:14.946 --> 00:53:16.155
your attitude,

1151
00:53:17.321 --> 00:53:18.488
But I'm starting to think

1152
00:53:18.571 --> 00:53:21.780
that who you choose to surround yourself
with is so much more import...


1153
00:53:40.946 --> 00:53:42.030
So awesome!

1154
00:53:42.113 --> 00:53:43.238
All right, bro!

1155
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:46.655
- Hey!
- Cameron!


1156
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:52.196
- Cameron! Cameron! Cameron!
- Awesome, man!


1157
00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.321
That was so awesome.

1158
00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:55.446
Hey. I'm Celeste.

1159
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.988
I wanted to say
that while I reject the whole idea


1160
00:53:58.071 --> 00:54:01.405
of the prom court as an antiquated,
heteronormative construct,


1161
00:54:01.488 --> 00:54:03.321
if I didn't, you'd have my vote.

1162
00:54:03.405 --> 00:54:04.405
Your vote for what?

1163
00:54:06.946 --> 00:54:08.405
Hey, Kweller. Dude.

1164
00:54:08.488 --> 00:54:11.071
Some Saturday night, huh?

1165
00:54:11.155 --> 00:54:12.738
Mr. Prom King nominee.

1166
00:54:12.821 --> 00:54:15.363
- What?
- Did you not see?


1167
00:54:15.446 --> 00:54:18.571
Cameroon Kewller for prom king.

1168
00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:19.988
That's ridiculous.

1169
00:54:20.071 --> 00:54:22.672
<i>Attention Earthquakes,
here are the prom court nominations.</i>


1170
00:54:22.696 --> 00:54:28.446
<i>For king, we have Jordan Van Draanen
and Cameroon Kewller?</i>


1171
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:29.988
<i>Tanya, is this a joke?</i>

1172
00:54:30.488 --> 00:54:34.155
<i>Okay. I am told that Cameroon</i>
is <i>an actual student,</i>


1173
00:54:34.238 --> 00:54:36.363
<i>so congratulations to him</i>

1174
00:54:36.446 --> 00:54:39.155
<i>and to our third nominee, 
Sebastian Woo.</i>

1175
00:54:39.696 --> 00:54:42.696
- Yes! Whoo! Yes! Whoo!
- Oh my God, dude!


1176
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.530
I'm the king of the school!

1177
00:54:44.613 --> 00:54:46.363
Sebastian Woo!

1178
00:54:46.446 --> 00:54:49.446
It is so fitting
that they would butcher your name.


1179
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:53.113
Could you imagine
if you actually ran for prom king?


1180
00:54:59.321 --> 00:55:01.738
Jordan Van D, baby!

1181
00:55:01.821 --> 00:55:03.738
Let's go!

1182
00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:07.905
Yeah, maybe I can.

1183
00:55:09.321 --> 00:55:10.321
Sawyer.

1184
00:55:10.655 --> 00:55:11.655
Alden.

1185
00:55:12.363 --> 00:55:13.571
And Jordan?

1186
00:55:14.363 --> 00:55:16.488
What the hell is going on?

1187
00:55:16.571 --> 00:55:17.946
JVD out.

1188
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:21.530
You know how you're running for
prom queen unopposed? Not anymore.

That day in Jordan's trailer. The video.

1198

- What about it?
- You were holding the camera.


1199
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:52.238
My entire life was falling apart,
and you didn't press stop.


1200

you wouldn't have done the same thing.


1203
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:03.155
- But I thought we were friends?
- Yeah, well.


1204
00:56:03.238 --> 00:56:06.905
Things aren't always the way they seem,
and you would know, right?


1205
00:56:06.988 --> 00:56:07.988
Yeah. That's right.

Did you think you were fooling us?

1209
00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:17.530
I mean, your mom's a nurse.
You can't afford a car.


1210
00:56:17.613 --> 00:56:19.280
You live in that dumpy shack on Clinton.

- Alden.
- Yeah, that's right.

Mmm. I don't know, like a year, maybe?
We didn't say anything.

1220
00:56:45.821 --> 00:56:47.405
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.


1221
00:56:47.488 --> 00:56:49.488
I only lied
because I thought if I told the truth,


1222
00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:51.363
you guys wouldn't like me anymore.

1223
00:56:51.446 --> 00:56:54.405
- I was embarrassed.
- I don't care... at all. Okay?


1224
00:56:54.488 --> 00:56:57.071
I swear I had no idea
she was planning this.


1225
00:56:57.155 --> 00:57:00.321
I don't get it. It's like she's suddenly
this whole different person.


1226
00:57:00.405 --> 00:57:02.988
Is she though? Maybe we're
just now seeing who she really is.


1227
00:57:03.071 --> 00:57:04.905
- What do you mean?
- She quit the dance team.


1228
00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.988
Now she's starting
her own squad with Jordan.


1229
00:57:07.071 --> 00:57:08.863
Unbelievable.

1230
00:57:10.155 --> 00:57:11.530
Wow. Look at you.

1231
00:57:11.613 --> 00:57:12.946
- Who is it?
- Nothing.


1232
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:14.405
- It's stupid.
- Really?


1233
00:57:14.488 --> 00:57:17.946
- Then why are you blushing?
- I'm not blushing. It's just a funny text.


1234
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:21.071
- Mm. A stupid, funny text from...
- Nisha.


1235
00:57:21.155 --> 00:57:23.363
Q! That's amazing.

1236
00:57:23.446 --> 00:57:25.488
I thought I saw
you guys talking at the party.


1237
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:27.030
Yeah, she's pretty great.

1238
00:57:27.113 --> 00:57:29.321
I was thinking about asking her to prom.

1239
00:57:29.405 --> 00:57:33.363
No way. Oh my God, that's so great.
You guys would be so cute together.


1240
00:57:33.446 --> 00:57:35.905
- So how are you gonna ask her?
- Hey, um...


1241
00:57:36.988 --> 00:57:37.988
You got a sec?

1242
00:57:38.905 --> 00:57:40.530
Go. I'll talk to you later.

1243
00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:44.821
I didn't think
you were talking to me anymore.


1244
00:57:44.905 --> 00:57:46.613
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1245
00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:49.321
I got really pissed off,
but you didn't do anything.


1246
00:57:49.405 --> 00:57:51.571
There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.


1247
00:57:51.655 --> 00:57:53.821
Hey! You, my man, are a rock star.

1248
00:57:53.905 --> 00:57:56.405
Inspiration. Do you want to hear a poem?

1249
00:57:57.113 --> 00:57:57.946
Sure.

1250
00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:00.280
<i>Um, Cameron Kweller</i>

1251
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.780
<i>Interstellar</i>

1252
00:58:01.821 --> 00:58:03.071
<i>Stood up to the dick</i>

1253
00:58:03.863 --> 00:58:04.863
<i>Made it stick</i>

1254
00:58:05.571 --> 00:58:06.821
<i>Cameron, one</i>

1255
00:58:06.905 --> 00:58:08.071
<i>Jordan, zero</i>

1256
00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:10.280
<i>King Cameron, you're my hero</i>

1257
00:58:10.363 --> 00:58:11.530
Fight the power, man.

1258
00:58:12.113 --> 00:58:13.405
That was great.

1259
00:58:13.488 --> 00:58:15.488
Ah, worth it.

1260
00:58:15.988 --> 00:58:18.238
Okay.

1261
00:58:18.321 --> 00:58:20.321
Can you believe all this prom BS?

1262
00:58:20.405 --> 00:58:23.696
I know. Pretty cool, right?
I mean, what do you think?


1263
00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:27.071
Well, that's actually
what I wanted to talk to you about.


1264
00:58:28.155 --> 00:58:30.155
Uh, but now I'm late for Art History.

1265
00:58:30.238 --> 00:58:34.113
Um, is there any chance
you could come over after school?


1266
00:58:34.196 --> 00:58:37.363
- There's something I wanted to show you.
- Um, sure.


1267
00:58:37.446 --> 00:58:38.571
- I'll be there.
- Cool.


1268
00:58:39.071 --> 00:58:40.071
Bye.

1269
00:58:43.113 --> 00:58:45.405
So this whole prom king thing,

1270
00:58:46.071 --> 00:58:48.071
I can't believe you're actually into it.

1271
00:58:48.155 --> 00:58:51.738
Well, I'm not really,
but I do hate Van Draanen.


1272
00:58:51.821 --> 00:58:55.238
Guys like him crap all over everyone
and somehow still end up on top.


1273
00:58:55.321 --> 00:58:57.780
Not this time.
Not if I have anything to do with it.


1274
00:58:57.863 --> 00:59:00.363
- That sounded confident.
- 'Cause I am.


1275
00:59:00.446 --> 00:59:03.280
And after Alden's party,
you have some serious traction.


1276
00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.780
But you're gonna have to let
people see the real Cam Kweller.


1277
00:59:06.863 --> 00:59:10.155
Well, speaking of the real me,
right this way.


1278
00:59:16.613 --> 00:59:19.738
Wow. I cannot believe
you have your own darkroom.


1279
00:59:20.238 --> 00:59:21.071
Yeah.

1280
00:59:21.155 --> 00:59:23.363
It was my 14th birthday present.

1281
00:59:23.863 --> 00:59:26.613
So you've been taking pictures
your whole life then?


1282
00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:29.655
Kind of.
Used to be more of a hobby,


1283
00:59:29.738 --> 00:59:31.696
but now I don't know.

1284
00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:35.488
Sometimes I feel like
I could spend my entire life in this room.


1285
00:59:36.113 --> 00:59:38.905
Cameron, these are amazing.

1286
00:59:39.571 --> 00:59:42.446
So why are you
letting me see them now?

1287
00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:44.780
Well, you wouldn't stop asking,

1288
00:59:45.363 --> 00:59:48.280
so I figured this was
the only way to get you to stop.


1289
00:59:48.363 --> 00:59:51.738
Well, you are very talented.

1290
00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:53.238
I mean, look at this one. Oh!

1291
00:59:54.238 --> 00:59:55.613
Oh my God, I am so sorry.

1292
00:59:55.696 --> 00:59:56.696
It's, uh...

1293
00:59:57.488 --> 00:59:58.655
It's okay.

1294
00:59:59.238 --> 01:00:00.238
Really.

1295
01:00:00.738 --> 01:00:03.321
You know, you could
totally make money at this, right?


1296
01:00:03.405 --> 01:00:04.988
You know I don't care about money.

1297
01:00:05.071 --> 01:00:08.488
Or not,
but keeping your talent locked away.


1298
01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:10.071
What are you hiding from?

1299
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.196
You know,
I could ask you the same question.


1300
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.655
What are you talking about?

1301
01:00:14.738 --> 01:00:18.530
Well, I'm talking about this.

1302
01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:23.696
And, uh... this.

1303
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.030
And these.

1304
01:00:27.488 --> 01:00:30.821
Not the eyelashes,
they're glued on pretty tight.

01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:47.946
Listen, Cameron,
there's something I need to tell you.


1312
01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:50.238
- And I need to tell you something too.
- Okay?


1313
01:00:51.196 --> 01:00:55.071
Well, you asked me
why I invited you here,

1314
01:00:55.738 --> 01:00:58.238
and I don't even let
my own grandmother in here.


1315
01:00:58.321 --> 01:00:59.488
- Really?
- Yeah.


1316
01:00:59.571 --> 01:01:02.446
Which is why she probably thinks
I'm running a meth lab.


1317
01:01:03.696 --> 01:01:05.571
So then why am I here?

1318
01:01:06.155 --> 01:01:07.613
Because I trust you.

1319
01:01:10.196 --> 01:01:11.363
Oh, okay.

1320
01:01:11.446 --> 01:01:13.738
- Well, I...
- Are you okay?


1321
01:01:14.488 --> 01:01:16.696
Totally, I just... I need to go.

1322
01:01:17.196 --> 01:01:20.280
- Besides, I've wasted enough of your time.
- I wouldn't put it that way.


1323
01:01:20.363 --> 01:01:23.613
No, that's not what I meant.
I just... I have somewhere to be.


1324
01:01:23.696 --> 01:01:25.946
- Um... Call you later?
- Yeah.


1325
01:01:26.696 --> 01:01:27.696
Sure.

1326
01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:36.821
Hey, you got a sec?

1327
01:01:37.405 --> 01:01:38.988
Uh, yeah. Why?

1328
01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:42.113
I just kind of wanted
your advice on something.


1329
01:01:42.696 --> 01:01:44.905
If it isn't the fountain of truth

1330
01:01:44.988 --> 01:01:48.113
coming to get help
figuring out the world of bullshit.


1331
01:01:48.196 --> 01:01:49.196
Yeah, funny.

1332
01:01:49.905 --> 01:01:51.405
Here's the deal. Uh...

1333
01:01:51.946 --> 01:01:55.780
Things with Padgett may have gotten
a little more complicated than I thought.


1334
01:01:55.863 --> 01:01:59.363
Okay. Complicated good or complicated bad?

1335
01:01:59.905 --> 01:02:04.280
'Cause the other night at that party,
I was definitely sensing chemistry.


1336
01:02:04.363 --> 01:02:05.655
Oh, wait.

1337
01:02:05.738 --> 01:02:06.863
Did you guys hook up?

1338
01:02:06.946 --> 01:02:08.780
Oh my God, you did!

1339
01:02:08.863 --> 01:02:12.030
No, no, no. We didn't hook up, we...

1340
01:02:12.821 --> 01:02:14.030
we kissed.

1341
01:02:14.113 --> 01:02:18.280
I knew it! Oh my God.
This is huge. So did you ask her to prom?


1342
01:02:18.363 --> 01:02:21.238
It makes sense if you go together.
And if you're king and queen?


1343
01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.530
How amazing would that be?

1344
01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:24.821
It would be like
Cali's own royal love story.


1345
01:02:24.905 --> 01:02:27.321
- And you're the princess.
- Whoa, whoa.


1346
01:02:27.405 --> 01:02:29.196
Yes. I thought about asking her,

1347
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.363
but after we kissed,
things just kind of got weird.


1348
01:02:33.446 --> 01:02:34.988
Of course they did. It's fine.

1349
01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:36.571
First kisses can be awkward.

1350
01:02:36.655 --> 01:02:39.030
First time having sex,
that can be even weirder.


1351
01:02:39.113 --> 01:02:40.863
So is the last time

1352
01:02:40.946 --> 01:02:43.821
'cause you never know
if it's gonna be your last.


1353
01:02:44.571 --> 01:02:45.655
Oh...

1354
01:02:45.738 --> 01:02:47.821
Wait, you've never had sex.

1355
01:02:47.905 --> 01:02:50.030
Yeah, but I know things, though.
Like this.


1356
01:02:50.113 --> 01:02:52.553
If you're worried about
whether you should ask Padgett or not,


1357
01:02:52.613 --> 01:02:53.988
just ask yourself one question.

1358
01:02:54.071 --> 01:02:55.238
Okay, what's that?

1359
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:56.780
Who kissed who first?

1360
01:02:57.613 --> 01:02:59.405
Actually, she kissed me first.

1361
01:03:00.155 --> 01:03:02.405
So I should ask her to prom, then.

1362
01:03:02.488 --> 01:03:05.238
Um, yeah, but you can't just ask, okay?

1363
01:03:05.321 --> 01:03:07.488
It's lame. You have to prompose.

1364
01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:10.196
What the hell is that?

1365
01:03:22.988 --> 01:03:24.696
- Hey.
- Hey.


1366
01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.113
No word from Cameron?

1367
01:03:26.196 --> 01:03:30.238
No, he must think I'm such a freak.
I practically sprinted out of there.


1368
01:03:30.321 --> 01:03:33.071
He had the nomination.
Why'd screw it up by kissing him?


1369
01:03:33.155 --> 01:03:34.988
- I do have one theory.
- Yeah?


1370
01:03:35.488 --> 01:03:38.571
You really like him, Padge,
and when you like someone


1371
01:03:38.655 --> 01:03:40.821
the other stuff
just doesn't matter as much.


1372
01:03:40.905 --> 01:03:42.071
I do.

1373
01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:43.446
I do like him.

1374
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.530
Yeah.

1375
01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:48.571
Something tells me you might not
have screwed up as much as you think.


1376
01:03:49.155 --> 01:03:51.238
- What do you mean?
- Hey, look, look!


1377
01:03:52.196 --> 01:03:54.238
Oh my God, Cameron.

1378
01:03:54.321 --> 01:03:57.321
I know this isn't
usually my style, obviously,


1379
01:03:57.405 --> 01:04:00.571
but, uh... what do you think?

1380
01:04:00.655 --> 01:04:02.488
- I think yes.
- Sorry.


1381
01:04:02.571 --> 01:04:06.821
I hate to interrupt this adorable moment,
but don't you think there's something


1382
01:04:06.905 --> 01:04:08.321
you should tell Cameron first?

1383
01:04:08.405 --> 01:04:10.464
- What are you doing?
- Leave her alone, Alden.


1384
01:04:10.488 --> 01:04:12.738
- Shut up, Quinn.
- What's going on?


1385
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:15.405
Padgett, do you want
to tell him, or should I?


1386
01:04:16.113 --> 01:04:19.155
- What's she talking about?
- What I was trying to tell you yesterday.


1387
01:04:19.238 --> 01:04:20.738
It's... It's actually funny.

1388
01:04:20.821 --> 01:04:22.613
After Jordan and I broke up,

1389
01:04:22.696 --> 01:04:25.405
I lost my sponsorships, my college money,

1390
01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:27.155
so I panicked.

1391
01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:30.280
- Yeah, she's not lying. Total meltdown.
- Yeah, thanks to you, Alden.


1392
01:04:30.363 --> 01:04:32.946
So I made a bet with Alden

1393
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:36.488
that I could take some person
and... and... and make them over.


1394
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:38.946
Some person. What kind of person?

1395
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:42.488
- Can we talk about this in private?
- No, what kind of person, Padgett?


1396
01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:45.196
The biggest loser
so she could turn him into prom king.


1397
01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.613
- But that was before...
- Wait. So I was a bet?


1398
01:04:47.696 --> 01:04:50.363
- No...
- No, I was a fucking bet.


1399
01:04:55.071 --> 01:04:56.238
You can all go to hell.

1400
01:04:57.196 --> 01:04:58.196
Let's go.

1401
01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:02.571
Yikes, that was hard to watch.

1402
01:05:09.613 --> 01:05:12.613
<i>Hey, it's Cameron.
Leave a message, or don't.</i>


1403
01:05:13.238 --> 01:05:16.905
Cameron, it's me again.

1404
01:05:17.905 --> 01:05:22.280
I know I covered this
in the 800 texts you haven't returned,


1405
01:05:22.363 --> 01:05:25.488
but I'm so sorry,

1406
01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:27.988
and I just want
to make sure you're okay.

1407
01:05:29.155 --> 01:05:30.696
He's still not answering?

1408
01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.196
No, but can you blame him?

1409
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:37.030
No, but right now,
I'm a little bit more worried about you.


1410
01:05:37.655 --> 01:05:39.488
You and your god-awful ironing.

1411
01:05:39.571 --> 01:05:41.071
Please let me do that. Please.

1412
01:05:41.905 --> 01:05:45.613
You know,
I convinced myself that I did my posts


1413
01:05:45.696 --> 01:05:49.863
because I cared about my followers,
but maybe I was just doing it for myself


1414
01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:52.488
to get money and get popular.

1415
01:05:53.071 --> 01:05:54.946
Maybe I'm just a fraud.

1416
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:57.655
Honey, I happen to know
for a fact that you're not a fake.


1417
01:05:57.738 --> 01:05:59.946
You're a truly kind and caring person.

1418
01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:03.405
But I hurt someone, Mom.
I mean, I really hurt him.


1419
01:06:03.488 --> 01:06:04.488
All right, yeah.

1420
01:06:04.946 --> 01:06:07.988
You screwed up, but it's only a mistake
if you don't learn from it.


1421
01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.905
I just don't even
know what to do anymore.

1422
01:06:10.988 --> 01:06:14.238
If I win tomorrow night, I'll have to go
in front of all these people...


1423
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:15.863
And be yourself.

1424
01:06:15.946 --> 01:06:19.905
But... what if I don't even like
who that is anymore?


1425
01:06:20.738 --> 01:06:23.738
Listen, I know
it feels like that right now.


1426
01:06:23.821 --> 01:06:26.446
I do. But the
Padgett Sawyer that I know,

1427
01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:29.905
the kind, sweet, generous,

1428
01:06:29.988 --> 01:06:33.613
sure, stubborn girl
that I've known for 18 years,


1429
01:06:33.696 --> 01:06:36.613
well, she gets lost now and again.

1430
01:06:36.696 --> 01:06:40.738
We all do,
but she always finds her way back.


1431
01:06:48.113 --> 01:06:49.280
Oh, Gilly.

1432
01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:52.571
I thought you were
a good judge of character.


1433
01:06:57.946 --> 01:06:59.030
All right.

1434
01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.196
- How do I look?
- Gorge.


1435
01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.071
You're gonna be the queen
of the chaperones.


1436
01:07:04.113 --> 01:07:06.905
Thank you. It looks like my car is here.
All right, put your dress on.


1437
01:07:06.988 --> 01:07:08.196
I'll see you there.

1438
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.113
Okay.

1439
01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:16.363
<i>- You're really gonna go through with this?
-</i>I mean...


1440
01:07:16.863 --> 01:07:18.863
I know I'm not
gonna get what I want,

1441
01:07:18.946 --> 01:07:21.988
so at least this way, I have a chance
to make things right with Cameron.


1442
01:07:22.113 --> 01:07:24.155
- Ha! Wanna bet?
- Too soon.


1443
01:07:24.238 --> 01:07:27.738
<i>Nisha, I know you don't trust me.</i>

1444
01:07:27.821 --> 01:07:30.196
<i>I mean, he's your best friend,</i>

1445
01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.696
<i>but I think I've really fallen for him,
so I have to try.</i>


1446
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.488
You have one big problem.
There's no way that dude is going to prom.


1447
01:07:39.196 --> 01:07:40.196
Yeah.

1448
01:07:40.238 --> 01:07:43.238
So I guess that means
there's only one person left to ask.


1449
01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:53.780
Screw off, Bubble Girl.

1450
01:07:53.863 --> 01:07:56.280
Okay, a little harsh,

1451
01:07:56.363 --> 01:07:58.071
<i>but I have to ask.</i>

1452
01:07:58.155 --> 01:07:59.238
Is he okay?

1453
01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:01.155
I don't know. He's at work.

1454
01:08:01.238 --> 01:08:04.321
<i>Why do you keep calling me?
Aren't you supposed to be at prom?</i>


1455
01:08:04.405 --> 01:08:06.196
Yeah, like half an hour ago.

1456
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.280
<i>But I have
a really important favor to ask.</i>


1457
01:08:08.363 --> 01:08:10.488
Tell me why in the
hell I should help you.

1458
01:08:10.571 --> 01:08:14.988
I can't, and I know you two
have lost so much more than me,


1459
01:08:15.488 --> 01:08:18.363
but I've lost a lot recently.

1460
01:08:19.321 --> 01:08:21.446
I lost my self-respect.

1461
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.780
<i>I lost my college fund.</i>

1462
01:08:24.488 --> 01:08:25.780
I lost my friends,

1463
01:08:27.696 --> 01:08:31.113
but the only thing
I truly care about losing...


1464
01:08:32.571 --> 01:08:33.571
is your brother.

1465
01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:37.893
<i>Tonight's the big night.</i>

1466
01:08:37.946 --> 01:08:41.446
<i>Turns out this year's dance presentation
is now gonna be a dance competition.</i>


1467
01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:44.405
<i>I don't know what that means,
but it's the committee's decision,</i>


1468
01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:45.488
<i>and I support them.</i>

1469
01:08:49.196 --> 01:08:50.196
Hey.

1470
01:08:52.071 --> 01:08:52.988
What's in the bag?

1471
01:08:53.071 --> 01:08:56.696
Formal wear, or the closest thing
I could find to it in your closet.


1472
01:08:57.488 --> 01:08:59.405
Dude, it's a disaster in there.

1473
01:08:59.488 --> 01:09:01.446
Why are there
so many Skittles on the floor?


1474
01:09:01.530 --> 01:09:05.030
Because I spilled some Skittles.
Look, if that's for prom, I...


1475
01:09:05.113 --> 01:09:08.655
Look, I know what you're gonna say,
okay, and... I get it.


1476
01:09:08.738 --> 01:09:10.280
Padgett screwed up.

1477
01:09:10.363 --> 01:09:13.113
What she did was mean
and selfish and wrong.


1478
01:09:13.196 --> 01:09:15.321
Yes, exactly. So why are you here?

1479
01:09:16.446 --> 01:09:17.571
Because, Cam...

1480
01:09:19.405 --> 01:09:21.155
I've... I've missed you.

1481
01:09:21.738 --> 01:09:22.905
Brin, I'm right here.

1482
01:09:22.988 --> 01:09:24.280
No, no. I mean, like...

1483
01:09:25.321 --> 01:09:27.696
I miss the way you used to be,
you know? Before...


1484
01:09:28.488 --> 01:09:29.488
Before Mom.

1485
01:09:30.446 --> 01:09:33.655
Ever since
you've been with Padgett, okay,


1486
01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:38.030
you've been back, and you've been
smiling again, and you've been happy.


1487
01:09:38.113 --> 01:09:41.988
And I just feel like...
...for the first time since we moved here


1488
01:09:42.655 --> 01:09:44.738
that I have my brother back.

1489
01:09:44.821 --> 01:09:46.446
And don't lose her, Cam.

1490
01:09:47.405 --> 01:09:50.530
We lost mom, and there's nothing
we could have done about that,


1491
01:09:50.613 --> 01:09:53.946
but now you have a choice,
so just... just don't lose her, okay?


1492
01:10:08.821 --> 01:10:11.863
There you are, thank God.
We need you to start the dance.


1493
01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:13.863
- Big night, huh?
- What do you want, Alden?


1494
01:10:13.946 --> 01:10:17.071
Nothing, I just noticed
you didn't bring Cameron.


1495
01:10:17.155 --> 01:10:19.113
- So...
- He's not coming. Okay?


1496
01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:20.905
You win the bet.

1497
01:10:20.988 --> 01:10:23.488
And when are you gonna become
a permanent loser?


1498
01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:25.696
I'll get it done as
soon as I can. Happy?

1499
01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:27.696
I'll be happy when I get my crown.

1500
01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:31.488
And, oh, hope you like the new
choreography me and Jordan came up with.


1501
01:10:31.571 --> 01:10:32.771
Cali High Earthquakes,

1502
01:10:32.821 --> 01:10:35.238
it's time to report to the stage
for your annual dance...


1503
01:10:35.321 --> 01:10:37.714
- Come on. This is it. Let's go.
- Jordan, it's time.


1504
01:10:37.738 --> 01:10:39.821
Come on, guys.
If you put your TikToks down,


1505
01:10:39.905 --> 01:10:42.280
you'll see some people dancing
in real life.


1506
01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:43.613
It's gonna be great.

1507
01:10:43.696 --> 01:10:47.071
We have
some weird-ass traditions at this school.


1508
01:10:47.155 --> 01:10:49.071

Hey, excuse me. Sorry. Hi.

1566
01:13:02.655 --> 01:13:05.738
We hired a DJ for this thing.
They said he was over here somewhere.


1567
01:13:05.821 --> 01:13:08.446
- Oh actually, that's... that's me.
- You're the DJ?


1568
01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:10.321
Great. Um, where's your stuff?

1569
01:13:10.905 --> 01:13:12.256
- My stuff?
- Yeah, your equipment.


1570
01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.738
Your... your turntables,

1571
01:13:13.821 --> 01:13:17.113
your jog wheel, crossfader?
Your... your Traktor scratch?


1572
01:13:17.196 --> 01:13:20.071
Dude, I have no idea
what any of that stuff is.


1573
01:13:20.655 --> 01:13:24.196
Are you telling me
we paid you $4,500 for your phone?


1574
01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.571
Yeah. Kinda.

1575
01:13:25.655 --> 01:13:27.696
You know that's more
than I make in a month?


1576
01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:30.571
Well... I know that now.

1577
01:13:30.655 --> 01:13:32.655
Hey, so no sign of Cameron?

1578
01:13:33.238 --> 01:13:35.821
No, and if he doesn't get here soon,
it's gonna be too late.


1579
01:13:35.905 --> 01:13:38.946
It already is. Principal Bosch's
about to announce the court.


1580
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:40.905
- You sure you still wanna do this?
- Yes.


1581
01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:44.655
If I win, I need you to live stream
on your phone, and then go on this app


1582
01:13:44.738 --> 01:13:46.446
on my phone and press the red button.

1583
01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:48.863
- I mean, how can I do both?
- Just give me the phone.


1584
01:13:49.363 --> 01:13:52.530
Hello, hi, hey.
One, two, three, eyes to me.


1585
01:13:52.613 --> 01:13:54.988
Come on, bring it in. 
It's the big moment.

1586
01:13:55.071 --> 01:13:58.196
I know this is live streaming,
but if you put your phones down,


1587
01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.363
it's actually happening
right here in front of you.


1588
01:14:00.446 --> 01:14:01.806
Um...

1589
01:14:01.863 --> 01:14:05.405
Look, I know this means a lot
to some of you, so let's get through it


1590
01:14:05.488 --> 01:14:06.863
so we can be done.

1591
01:14:06.946 --> 01:14:11.363
All right,
your 2021 Cali High Prom King is


1592
01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:13.405
Jordan Van Draanen.

1593
01:14:15.405 --> 01:14:17.113
Congratulations to Jordan.

1594
01:14:17.613 --> 01:14:19.113
So humble, isn't he?

1595
01:14:19.738 --> 01:14:22.280
Just wanna slap his face.

1596
01:14:22.363 --> 01:14:25.738
I'm kidding. I would never slap a student,
not until after they graduate.


1597
01:14:25.821 --> 01:14:27.821
But he's not going to graduate,
so it's fine.


1598
01:14:27.905 --> 01:14:28.905
Okay.

1599
01:14:29.321 --> 01:14:32.280
Here you go, big guy. So proud.

1600
01:14:32.363 --> 01:14:34.363
Enjoy your moment of glory.

1601
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:37.071
Not my favorite.

1602
01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:41.405
It's Jordan Van Draanen, baby.

1603
01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:46.863
Is that it?

1604
01:14:46.946 --> 01:14:47.780
Yeah, bro.

1605
01:14:47.863 --> 01:14:48.905
Of course, it is.

1606
01:14:50.488 --> 01:14:51.905
No, I just want the microphone.

1607
01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.405
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. Okay, all right, yes!


1608
01:14:54.488 --> 01:14:55.613
Well, that was fun.

1609
01:14:55.696 --> 01:14:58.946
Moving right along. 
Your 2021 Prom Queen,

1610
01:14:59.030 --> 01:15:01.696
the woman voted to a forcible dance
with the guy behind me.


1611
01:15:02.321 --> 01:15:04.696
No, no, no, no, no.
Keep it on. Keep it all on.


1612
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:07.155
We have all seen plenty of your nipples.

1613
01:15:08.321 --> 01:15:10.655
All right, your 2021 Prom Queen,

1614
01:15:10.738 --> 01:15:14.446
in the closest vote
we've had in a very long time,


1615
01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:15.738
Padgett Sawyer.

1616
01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.488
Yeah, Padgett!

1617
01:15:26.196 --> 01:15:27.613
Congratulations.

1618
01:15:27.696 --> 01:15:29.196
- Thank you!
- Really beautiful.


1619
01:15:29.905 --> 01:15:30.945
That's right, Padge!

1620
01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:34.821
This is me.

1621
01:15:35.655 --> 01:15:38.280
And this is also me.

1622
01:15:40.071 --> 01:15:41.196
And this is me too.

1623
01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.530
Hey.

1624
01:15:42.613 --> 01:15:46.238
But I'm gonna let you guys in
on a little secret. It's all fake.


1625
01:15:47.155 --> 01:15:50.946
Because the truth is, this is the <i>real</i>me.

1626
01:15:53.655 --> 01:15:55.155
And so is this.

1627
01:15:56.738 --> 01:15:58.821
Let's not forget about this one.

1628
01:16:01.113 --> 01:16:02.196
Bubble Girl!

1629
01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.155
Yep, that is snot
coming out of my nose.

1630
01:16:05.238 --> 01:16:07.030
But here's the thing.

1631
01:16:07.613 --> 01:16:09.905
For the last four years,

1632
01:16:09.988 --> 01:16:12.946
I've been so busy
selling myself on social media,


1633
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:16.488
putting out this image
of who I wanted people to think I am,


1634
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:18.321
this perfect person

1635
01:16:18.405 --> 01:16:19.696
with perfect makeup,

1636
01:16:20.196 --> 01:16:21.196
perfect clothes,

1637
01:16:21.238 --> 01:16:22.446
perfect grades,

1638
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:24.613
the perfect boyfriend.

1639
01:16:25.905 --> 01:16:26.946
And trust me.

1640
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:29.363
Nothing could've been
further from the truth.


1641
01:16:29.946 --> 01:16:31.613
I even lied about where I live.

1642
01:16:33.363 --> 01:16:34.488
We all do it...

1643
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:36.738
in our own way

1644
01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:39.113
like someone special once told me.

1645
01:16:46.321 --> 01:16:50.196
He said high school is
just a bunch of scared people


1646
01:16:50.696 --> 01:16:53.071
pretending to be something they're not,

1647
01:16:53.155 --> 01:16:54.988
and that can be true.

1648
01:16:55.488 --> 01:16:57.696
Especially when we're at our worst.

1649
01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:00.530
But it doesn't have to be that way.

1650
01:17:02.613 --> 01:17:04.196
That's the lesson he taught me.

1651
01:17:11.571 --> 01:17:14.488
I only wish
I didn't have to lose him to learn it.


1652
01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:22.780
Are you sure?

1653
01:17:24.363 --> 01:17:26.530
Second place,
coming through, make some room.


1654
01:17:26.613 --> 01:17:30.655
Second place, I'll take it. I mean,
if she doesn't want it, I'll take it.


1655
01:17:30.738 --> 01:17:34.655
Excuse me, Ms. Pierce,
you... you actually came in fourth.


1656
01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.405
No, I demand a recount.

1657
01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.321
No need. You actually lost by a lot.

1658
01:17:42.155 --> 01:17:43.321
Please leave the stage.

1659
01:17:43.405 --> 01:17:44.446
- Ow!
- Down!


1660
01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:46.363
- Burn!
- Thank you. All right!


1661
01:17:46.446 --> 01:17:49.780
So the runner-up and your 2021 Prom Queen

1662
01:17:49.863 --> 01:17:51.988
is a write-in candidate.

1663
01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:54.696
Her name is Celeste Straczynski.

1664
01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:58.238
Is there a Celeste Straczynski here?

1665
01:18:00.821 --> 01:18:01.905
Does she go here?

1666
01:18:04.655 --> 01:18:05.655
Your hat.

1667
01:18:12.821 --> 01:18:14.613
All right, let's do this.

1704
01:19:58.863 --> 01:20:00.655
