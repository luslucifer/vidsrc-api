What?

34
00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:26.802
What do you, what salad do you like?

35
00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.780
Elise, what are you doing here?

36
00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:41.483
You didn't even call
to say you were coming.


37
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.321
Yeah,

38
00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:48.657
so, I'd better be off.

39
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.860
I'm preparing things for the
Collins account tomorrow.


40
00:02:51.894 --> 00:02:53.362
Um...

41
00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:56.865
So if we meet first
thing and grab a coffee,


42
00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:58.500
then we can review.

43
00:02:58.534 --> 00:02:59.768
Yeah.

44
00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:01.670
You better make mine extra strong.

45
00:03:01.703 --> 00:03:04.173
As if I'd forget such
a thing in the morning.


46
00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:09.277
So,

47
00:03:09.912 --> 00:03:12.147
what do you need?

48
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:14.450
Well, I just thought you said you were

49
00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:16.685
gonna be on time this evening for dinner.

50
00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:19.588
And they needed me to stay late, so...

51
00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:22.057
So I'm here.

52
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.592
Do you know what day it is today?

53
00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:28.196
You lost me.

54
00:03:29.298 --> 00:03:30.298
Third of March.

55
00:03:34.837 --> 00:03:36.205
Our anniversary.

56
00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.209
Oh fuck, Elise, 
I totally forgot.

57
00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:41.510
Yeah, I know.

58
00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.915
It's the work load they've put me on.

59
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.451
I was completely snowed under here and...

60
00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:52.287
Yeah, you looked really busy
when I walked in just then.


61
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:53.321
Really busy.

62
00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:03.232
Look, I was just...

63
00:04:09.938 --> 00:04:10.938
Hello?

64
00:04:11.874 --> 00:04:13.308
No, I can't right now.

65
00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:17.613
Okay, okay, yes, all right.

66
00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:18.857
Okay. I'll come and meet you now.

67
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:19.881
Okay, bye.

68
00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.921
I have to go.

69
00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:27.623
Okay, it's an emergency.

70
00:04:27.656 --> 00:04:28.991
Sorry.

71
00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:30.759
- No, you don't.
- I have to go.


72
00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:31.927
- Okay?
- Please, no.


73
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.995
That was Simon.

74
00:04:33.028 --> 00:04:36.265
Oh, Rick, no, not tonight,
it's our anniversary.


75
00:04:36.298 --> 00:04:37.266
Come on, please.

76
00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:39.568
Look, stay with me tonight.

77
00:04:41.637 --> 00:04:44.907
Elise, I can't, 
I've got to go, okay?

78
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.611
No you don't.

79
00:04:49.645 --> 00:04:51.980
Just put my dinner in the oven, okay?

80
00:04:52.014 --> 00:04:53.715
I'll have it later.

81
00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:42.064
So let me get this right.

82
00:05:42.097 --> 00:05:44.399
He actually forgot your anniversary?

83
00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:45.767
Yep.

84
00:05:45.801 --> 00:05:47.903
And I stood there in a corset.

85
00:05:50.105 --> 00:05:51.540
Got completely rejected.

86
00:05:54.643 --> 00:05:56.545
God, I feel like such a fucking idiot.

87
00:05:57.813 --> 00:05:59.815
You're gonna need
something stronger than that.


88
00:05:59.848 --> 00:06:00.949
Wait, hold on.

89
00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:07.089
I mean, it's obvious
what's been going on, though.


90
00:06:07.122 --> 00:06:08.323
I've known it for months.

91
00:06:08.357 --> 00:06:09.357
Go on.

92
00:06:10.392 --> 00:06:11.793
Well, he's cheating on me.

93
00:06:11.827 --> 00:06:15.397
What, with one of those receptionists?

94
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.465
Yeah.

95
00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.066
Yeah, he must be.

96
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.668
In fact, I know he is.

97
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:21.412
I mean, all these strange
work hours of his,


98
00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:23.839
and having to suddenly leave
in the middle of the night.


99
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.475
No, he's cheating on me.

100
00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:29.011
You know what I would do?

101
00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:30.012
What?

102
00:06:30.045 --> 00:06:33.515
Go fuck every man in sight.

103
00:06:33.548 --> 00:06:35.384
Oh, what?

104
00:06:35.417 --> 00:06:36.685
Get him back.

105
00:06:38.387 --> 00:06:39.864
You know, and if he has
a reason to dump you


106
00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:41.390
in the future for some other girl,

107
00:06:41.423 --> 00:06:44.359
then you have something
to throw in his face.


108
00:06:44.393 --> 00:06:46.070
No, no, no, I couldn't
do anything like that.


109
00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:49.097
I mean, I'm married,
I couldn't do that to him.


110
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:50.131
Go have fun.

111
00:06:51.667 --> 00:06:53.368
Enjoy yourself, you deserve it.

112
00:06:53.402 --> 00:06:54.903
I couldn't do that to him.

113
00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:56.405
It's just wrong.

114
00:06:57.506 --> 00:06:58.507
No.

115
00:07:03.412 --> 00:07:04.646
He's here.

116
00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.480
- Who's here?
- He's here.


117
00:07:05.514 --> 00:07:06.148
Come on, you need to go.

118
00:07:06.181 --> 00:07:08.383
Wait, who's here?

119
00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:09.551
Raymond.

120
00:07:09.584 --> 00:07:11.024
- Some guy I met online.
- No, no, no.


121
00:07:11.053 --> 00:07:13.455
Didn't you learn your
lesson after the last one?


122
00:07:13.488 --> 00:07:16.425
That guy, I can't remember
what he as called.


123
00:07:16.458 --> 00:07:17.426
Charlie?

124
00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:18.694
Yeah, Charlie.

125
00:07:18.727 --> 00:07:21.029
Oh, he was hot,
but got weird as fuck.

126
00:07:21.063 --> 00:07:22.464
You know, he wouldn't stop texting

127
00:07:22.497 --> 00:07:24.132
and calling me and stuff but...

128
00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:25.467
Yeah, I had to get rid of him.

129
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.134
Now, come on, you need to go.

130
00:07:26.168 --> 00:07:27.169
Okay.

131
00:07:27.202 --> 00:07:29.137
Just be careful with this one.

132
00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:31.807
Is he cute?

133
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.143
He's stacked and he's well hung.

134
00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:37.179
If that makes me a
bad friend then so be it

135
00:07:37.212 --> 00:07:39.181
but, come on, you need to go.

136
00:07:39.214 --> 00:07:41.183
Okay.

137
00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:42.427
God, ever since you left your marriage

138
00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:44.786
you've been having so much fun.

139
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.188
I have.

140
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:47.456
And so should you.

141
00:07:48.924 --> 00:07:52.027
Now, don't be a sorry old ass
and get some fresh young meat.


142
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.195
Now go on, you need to go.

143
00:07:53.228 --> 00:07:55.731
Okay, okay, have fun.

144
00:07:55.764 --> 00:07:56.764

in this meeting book.

167
00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:50.605
It was for 3 p.m. to
meet with Janet Waters.


168
00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:53.241
To take a few images
for a client, I suppose.

00:10:53.275 --> 00:10:54.275
Felix?

170
00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:57.612
Ah, Janet, nice to meet you.

171
00:10:57.646 --> 00:10:59.648
Yeah, we don't actually need you today.

172
00:11:00.382 --> 00:11:01.816
Why is that?

173
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.685
Because we don't need a photographer.

174
00:11:03.718 --> 00:11:04.729
It must've slipped my mind.

175
00:11:04.753 --> 00:11:06.397
But anyway, we don't
need you so please leave.


176
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:09.124
Really nice way to run a business, lady.

177
00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:11.893
Really nice.

178
00:11:11.927 --> 00:11:13.028
Thank you for nothing.

179
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.132
Cheers, thank you very much.

180
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.100
Great.

181
00:11:22.404 --> 00:11:25.006
Oh, Elise, if you're looking for Rick,

182
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.009
he's actually got a meeting
with a client of ours.


183
00:11:28.043 --> 00:11:30.979
He and she have had the
date booked in for awhile.


184
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.460
Elise?

185
00:11:48.797 --> 00:11:49.797
Elise?

186
00:12:41.916 --> 00:12:44.285
All right, I'm off out.

187
00:12:44.319 --> 00:12:46.421
Don't bother with dinner.

188
00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:53.061
You off out somewhere?

189
00:12:53.094 --> 00:12:54.029
No.

190
00:12:54.062 --> 00:12:56.331
It's just the outfit, then?

191
00:12:57.298 --> 00:12:59.934
Okay, I'll see you later.

192
00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:43.511
Hey, do you mind?

193
00:13:43.545 --> 00:13:44.813
No, go ahead.

194
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:55.602
You know, you could just go
over there and talk to him.


195
00:13:56.558 --> 00:13:57.859
What do you mean?

196
00:13:58.827 --> 00:14:00.071
Whoever that guy is over there,

197
00:14:00.095 --> 00:14:01.505
you're pretty enough to go over there.

198
00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:03.531
I'm sure he would not turn you away.

199
00:14:05.233 --> 00:14:07.435
No, no, it's nothing like that.

200
00:14:07.469 --> 00:14:08.937
What's it like?

201
00:14:12.841 --> 00:14:13.841
What's wrong?

202
00:14:14.576 --> 00:14:15.977
Man in black gone.

203
00:14:17.345 --> 00:14:18.345
What?

204
00:14:19.614 --> 00:14:20.782
Yeah, actually.

205
00:14:21.583 --> 00:14:22.583
Well,

206
00:14:23.952 --> 00:14:25.053
I'm not going anywhere.

207
00:14:36.064 --> 00:14:37.408
I don't know who
that guy was over there

208
00:14:37.432 --> 00:14:39.200
but he clearly doesn't deserve you.

209
00:14:39.234 --> 00:14:41.169
Wow, you sure do know
how to flatter a girl.


210
00:14:41.202 --> 00:14:43.838
I flatter the ones I want, yeah.

211
00:14:43.872 --> 00:14:45.874
And the ones you don't?

212
00:14:45.907 --> 00:14:47.609
Why would that matter?

213
00:14:47.642 --> 00:14:49.911
You are not one of those.

214
00:14:53.548 --> 00:14:54.548
Oh my God, it's you.

215
00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:56.594
The photographer from the office.

216
00:14:56.618 --> 00:14:57.886
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

217
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.498
It's nice to see I've made an impression.

218
00:15:00.522 --> 00:15:02.624
No, no, it's not that, 
I've had a lot on.

219
00:15:02.657 --> 00:15:04.259
But, listen, about Janet,

220
00:15:04.292 --> 00:15:05.903
don't pay any attention to what she says.

221
00:15:05.927 --> 00:15:06.971
She can be a real bitch some...

222
00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:08.463
Your boss.

223
00:15:08.496 --> 00:15:10.999
No, no, she's not my boss
and I don't work there either,


224
00:15:11.032 --> 00:15:11.933
for the record.

225
00:15:11.966 --> 00:15:13.168
May I ask you what you do?

226
00:15:13.201 --> 00:15:14.445
Don't tell me you're a photographer as well

227
00:15:14.469 --> 00:15:16.004
who stole my job from me.

228
00:15:16.037 --> 00:15:17.071
No, no.

229
00:15:17.105 --> 00:15:18.173
Are you?

230
00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:19.941
- No, no, I'm not.
- Good.


231
00:15:19.974 --> 00:15:21.142
I wanna photograph you.

232
00:15:21.176 --> 00:15:24.379
Not a portfolio, just a one time thing.

233
00:15:24.412 --> 00:15:27.115
No, my days of posing for
the camera are long gone.


234
00:15:28.249 --> 00:15:30.652
Wait, you've posed before?

235
00:15:30.685 --> 00:15:31.786
Why didn't you tell me?

236
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.922
Yeah, I used to do some
acting when I was younger.


237
00:15:33.955 --> 00:15:35.256
Why did you stop?

238
00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.090
Please let me.

239
00:15:36.124 --> 00:15:37.192
You'll enjoy it

240
00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:42.529
Just let me.

241
00:15:54.442 --> 00:15:57.045
Are you sure we should
be doing the shoot inside?


242
00:16:00.048 --> 00:16:01.048
What?

243
00:16:03.718 --> 00:16:05.620
You don't like it.

244
00:16:05.653 --> 00:16:06.588
It's fine, I can...

245
00:16:06.621 --> 00:16:08.590
No, you...

246
00:16:08.623 --> 00:16:09.624
You look incredible.

247
00:16:12.994 --> 00:16:13.994
Have a seat.

248
00:16:15.697 --> 00:16:17.365
Anywhere you want, pick it.

249
00:16:19.067 --> 00:16:20.335
Anywhere you want.

250
00:16:20.368 --> 00:16:21.135
Anywhere?

251
00:16:21.169 --> 00:16:22.070
Mm-hmm.

252
00:16:22.103 --> 00:16:23.371
Okay.

253
00:16:25.974 --> 00:16:27.175
But not there.

254
00:16:28.977 --> 00:16:30.245
Is here okay?

255
00:16:30.278 --> 00:16:31.646
Mm-hmm.

256
00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:32.679
I have also

257
00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:36.484
prepared...

258
00:16:36.517 --> 00:16:37.719
Some candles.

259
00:16:37.752 --> 00:16:38.686
I'm a bit nervous.

260
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.054
Don't be.

261
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:43.191
I'm just gonna take a few test shots.

262
00:16:43.224 --> 00:16:44.368
I haven't done this for awhile, so.

263
00:16:44.392 --> 00:16:45.693
You'll be fine.

264
00:16:45.727 --> 00:16:47.495
Just relax.

265
00:16:53.768 --> 00:16:55.470
So do you live here with someone?

266
00:16:56.604 --> 00:16:59.974
Yeah, actually...

267
00:17:00.008 --> 00:17:00.642
My husband.

268
00:17:00.675 --> 00:17:02.110
Oh, really?

269
00:17:02.143 --> 00:17:03.678
And where is he?

270
00:17:05.113 --> 00:17:06.714
Embarrassing...

271
00:17:06.748 --> 00:17:07.649
Turn this way.

272
00:17:07.682 --> 00:17:09.651
He was the guy
I was spying on earlier.

273
00:17:09.684 --> 00:17:10.684
Really?

274
00:17:12.086 --> 00:17:13.655
Yeah, I know it's a bit weird but...

275
00:17:13.688 --> 00:17:15.023
That is a little bit weird.

276
00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:16.291
I have my reasons.

277
00:17:16.324 --> 00:17:17.992
No, I think it's

278
00:17:18.026 --> 00:17:19.394
actually quite hot.

279
00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:22.297
Trust me, it's not.

280
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.498
How do these look?

281
00:17:23.531 --> 00:17:25.566
I'll show you in a minute.

282
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.634
You're so impatient.

283
00:17:26.668 --> 00:17:29.370
I'm curious.

284
00:17:43.184 --> 00:17:44.085
You had a little bit of...

285
00:17:44.118 --> 00:17:45.553
Oh.

286
00:17:45.586 --> 00:17:47.355
Lipstick on your...

287
00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:49.356
My chin?

288
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.495
You're perfect.

289
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.699
I'm really not.

290
00:17:57.732 --> 00:18:00.735
What has your husband done to you?

291
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.071
What do you mean?

292
00:18:03.104 --> 00:18:04.904
Well, to make you lose
all your confidence?


293
00:18:11.846 --> 00:18:13.348
Come here.

294
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:15.650
- What?
- Give me your hand.


295
00:18:15.683 --> 00:18:18.052
Come on.

296
00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:19.087
Walk this way.

297
00:18:20.254 --> 00:18:21.422
What?

298
00:18:21.456 --> 00:18:22.390
Come with me.

299
00:18:22.423 --> 00:18:25.159
Wait, wait.

300
00:18:25.193 --> 00:18:26.127
Sit down.

301
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.761
Oh gosh.

302
00:18:26.794 --> 00:18:28.162
Go on, back.

303
00:18:30.264 --> 00:18:32.133
What're you doing?

304
00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:33.167
You ready?

305
00:18:34.369 --> 00:18:35.369
Boo.

306
00:18:37.305 --> 00:18:41.476
That is what we call a mirror.

307
00:18:43.344 --> 00:18:44.344
Look at yourself.

308
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.248
Will you keep your eyes on yourself?

309
00:18:53.121 --> 00:18:54.555
You're beautiful.

310
00:18:56.524 --> 00:18:58.359
You need to know that.

311
00:19:00.795 --> 00:19:02.530
Look at yourself.

312
00:19:02.563 --> 00:19:04.265
Nobody looks like that.

313
00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:07.735
Or feels like this.

314
00:19:13.841 --> 00:19:14.842
Take your dress off.

315
00:19:16.177 --> 00:19:17.779
What?

316
00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:19.147
I don't even know your name.

317
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.215
Oh, how rude of me.

318
00:19:21.249 --> 00:19:24.185
Felix, nice to meet you.

319
00:19:26.554 --> 00:19:27.554
Elise.

320
00:19:40.601 --> 00:19:43.771
I want your confidence to come back.

321
00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:50.244
Kiss me.

322
00:20:10.331 --> 00:20:12.200
You're so beautiful.

323
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.968
Wait, no, I can't.

324
00:20:47.001 --> 00:20:49.303
- I can't.
- What's wrong?


325
00:20:49.337 --> 00:20:50.938
I can't do this.

326
00:20:50.972 --> 00:20:51.906
Why?

327
00:20:51.939 --> 00:20:53.875
You just need to leave.

328
00:21:57.738 --> 00:21:59.807
Can I get any
of you guys a coffee?

329
00:22:07.615 --> 00:22:09.584
We're fine, thank you, Elise.

330
00:22:09.617 --> 00:22:10.952
You're so sweet.

331
00:22:18.993 --> 00:22:19.860
Rick,

332
00:22:19.894 --> 00:22:22.330
I've gotta get going.

333
00:22:27.969 --> 00:22:30.504
Give me a kiss then.

334
00:22:30.538 --> 00:22:31.939
Rick, actually,

335
00:22:32.807 --> 00:22:34.075
before you go, 
I just need you

336
00:22:34.108 --> 00:22:35.843
to have a look at this floor plan.

337
00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:37.054
I've had them drawn up for awhile

338
00:22:37.078 --> 00:22:39.580
but I just need you to approve them.

339
00:22:39.614 --> 00:22:40.881
What is this?

340
00:22:40.915 --> 00:22:41.915
Why me?

341
00:22:42.917 --> 00:22:44.719
The floor plan for the stairs.

342
00:22:46.053 --> 00:22:47.154
Remember?

343
00:22:47.188 --> 00:22:49.357
I was thinking we should
have it over in this corner.


344
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.324
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Like we originally planned,


345
00:22:50.358 --> 00:22:52.059
then it would make more sense.

346
00:22:52.093 --> 00:22:55.062
Tessa, can I have some
time to go over this?


347
00:22:55.096 --> 00:22:56.063
Yeah.

348
00:22:56.097 --> 00:22:57.999
Give Elise some help.

349
00:22:58.032 --> 00:23:00.501
I'm more than capable
of doing this myself.


350
00:23:00.534 --> 00:23:01.778
- Elise, you don't know...
- I've nearly finished it.


351
00:23:01.802 --> 00:23:02.980
The first thing about this stuff, okay?

352
00:23:03.004 --> 00:23:04.639
- But look, I've...
- Tessa.


353
00:23:04.672 --> 00:23:06.741
Next week, okay?

354
00:23:06.774 --> 00:23:08.943
Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

00:24:37.865 --> 00:24:38.865
Sure.

369
00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:45.439
Get upstairs!

370
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:52.113
I need a way to...

371
00:24:52.146 --> 00:24:53.013
No.

372
00:24:53.047 --> 00:24:53.981
Okay.

373
00:24:54.014 --> 00:24:55.449
- Are you ready?
- Don't drop me!


374
00:24:55.483 --> 00:24:56.617
Are you ready?

375
00:25:00.988 --> 00:25:01.989
What's that?

376
00:25:02.022 --> 00:25:02.823
Huh?

377
00:25:02.857 --> 00:25:04.692
All that shit.

378
00:25:07.728 --> 00:25:08.729
Oh my God.

379
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:23.944
Oh fuck, it's Rick.

380
00:25:23.978 --> 00:25:25.045
Okay.

381
00:25:26.881 --> 00:25:27.748
You've gotta go.

382
00:25:27.782 --> 00:25:29.116
It's fine.

383
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.160
- No, Felix, it's not fine.
- I've met before.


384
00:25:30.184 --> 00:25:30.985
No!

385
00:25:31.018 --> 00:25:32.920
- Please, just go.
- Are you serious?


386
00:25:32.953 --> 00:25:35.623
Look, I need to go and speak to...

387
00:25:53.874 --> 00:25:55.075
Hey.

388
00:25:55.109 --> 00:25:57.711
I wasn't expecting you back so soon.

389
00:25:57.745 --> 00:25:59.180
Listen,

390
00:25:59.213 --> 00:26:01.582
I know I haven't been around that much

391
00:26:02.817 --> 00:26:05.486
and I've been absent in our relationship.

392
00:26:08.589 --> 00:26:09.290
Yeah.

393
00:26:09.323 --> 00:26:10.363
But I want this to work.

394
00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:14.829
I want us to get
back what we had again.

395
00:26:14.862 --> 00:26:17.031
But why?

396
00:26:17.064 --> 00:26:20.267
Why haven't you been there?

397
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:22.736
Work has just completely taken over

398
00:26:23.771 --> 00:26:25.973
and after what happened,

399
00:26:26.006 --> 00:26:28.609
I think I used
it as a big coverup.

400
00:26:28.642 --> 00:26:31.912
And I delved deeper into it to
avoid the realities of life.


401
00:26:34.815 --> 00:26:36.584
I should've been there for you.

402
00:26:40.955 --> 00:26:43.757
I shouldn't have left
you on your own to cope.


403
00:26:46.093 --> 00:26:47.695
I'm sorry, Elise.

404
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.200
Anyways...

405
00:27:01.642 --> 00:27:02.676
See?

406
00:27:11.318 --> 00:27:13.254
I'm gonna grab a shower.

407
00:27:13.287 --> 00:27:14.355
Will you do me a favor?

408
00:27:14.388 --> 00:27:15.289
Mm-hmm?

409
00:27:15.322 --> 00:27:16.090
Will you grab me some ties?

410
00:27:16.123 --> 00:27:17.324
I've gotta pack up.

411
00:27:17.358 --> 00:27:18.859
Yeah, of course.

412
00:27:37.211 --> 00:27:39.713
Oh my God, what're you doing?

413
00:27:39.747 --> 00:27:41.215
What took you so long?

414
00:27:41.248 --> 00:27:43.384
Felix, he's in the shower.

415
00:27:43.417 --> 00:27:45.185
Yeah, I know.

416
00:27:45.219 --> 00:27:47.955
That's exactly what you love about it.

417
00:27:47.988 --> 00:27:49.390
No, we can't.

418
00:27:49.423 --> 00:27:51.258
We can.

419
00:28:25.693 --> 00:28:27.294
Yeah?

420
00:28:27.328 --> 00:28:29.363
Could you grab me a towel?

421
00:28:29.396 --> 00:28:30.664
Yeah, sure.

422
00:29:13.073 --> 00:29:14.308
Elise?

423
00:29:17.778 --> 00:29:19.947
Can you pass me the towel?

424
00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.805
How long were you watching?

425
00:29:45.806 --> 00:29:48.275
Long enough.

426
00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:49.443
Came prepared.

427
00:30:53.507 --> 00:30:54.541
Okay.

428
00:30:54.575 --> 00:30:57.344
Well I will see
you in a few days.

429
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.515
This trip.

430
00:31:01.548 --> 00:31:02.850
What is it?

431
00:31:03.517 --> 00:31:05.953
Some boring business stuff.

432
00:31:07.121 --> 00:31:09.590
Noting you would be interested in.

433
00:31:09.623 --> 00:31:10.858
Okay.

434
00:31:14.194 --> 00:31:15.829
Okay.

435
00:31:15.863 --> 00:31:16.563
Have a good time.

436
00:31:16.597 --> 00:31:17.965
Okay, you too.

437
00:31:17.998 --> 00:31:19.166
See you later.

438
00:31:30.077 --> 00:31:31.411
Perfection.

439
00:31:36.283 --> 00:31:37.084
Fuck.

440
00:31:37.117 --> 00:31:37.918
What?

441
00:31:37.951 --> 00:31:38.619
Don't I have to go?

442
00:31:38.652 --> 00:31:39.553
Your husbands gonna be home.

443
00:31:39.586 --> 00:31:41.121
Oh, no, no, no, relax, relax.

444
00:31:42.122 --> 00:31:43.390
Relax.

445
00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:46.894
Rick's actually away on a business trip.

446
00:31:46.927 --> 00:31:47.995
Oh, is he?

447
00:31:48.028 --> 00:31:49.196
Yeah.

448
00:31:49.229 --> 00:31:50.898
You didn't say.

449
00:31:50.931 --> 00:31:52.332
Well, he's not back till Tuesday,

450
00:31:52.366 --> 00:31:55.068
so I'm gonna be all alone.

451
00:31:55.102 --> 00:31:57.171
Oh, am I invited?

452
00:31:57.204 --> 00:31:58.972
I can come around.

453
00:31:59.006 --> 00:32:00.646
Do you even need an invitation anymore?

454
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.982
You know when we first met?

455
00:32:09.016 --> 00:32:10.016
Mm-hmm?

456
00:32:12.019 --> 00:32:14.354
I said that I wanted to
fulfill your ever desire.


457
00:32:19.626 --> 00:32:20.626
Well, I do.

458
00:32:25.165 --> 00:32:26.165
I do.

459
00:32:27.668 --> 00:32:28.902
Like what?

460
00:32:31.972 --> 00:32:33.006
Well,

461
00:32:34.675 --> 00:32:36.243
you want to know something?

462
00:32:36.276 --> 00:32:37.911
Hmmm?

463
00:32:37.945 --> 00:32:41.048
I'd liked seeing you with another man.

464
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:43.950
I did.

465
00:32:45.586 --> 00:32:46.386
Really?

466
00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.420
Mm-hmm.

467
00:32:50.691 --> 00:32:51.691
I wanna...

468
00:32:54.995 --> 00:32:55.995
How should I put it?

469
00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:01.201
Invite other men over to your house and

470
00:33:02.636 --> 00:33:06.673
give them permission to make
love to a married woman.


471
00:33:11.178 --> 00:33:12.512
Don't look at me like that.

472
00:33:12.546 --> 00:33:13.447
That's what you want?

473
00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.480
Yeah.

474
00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:19.453
Do you want that?

475
00:33:19.486 --> 00:33:20.721
Yeah.

476
00:33:20.754 --> 00:33:21.922
I guess.

477
00:33:23.357 --> 00:33:26.660
Okay, I'll arrange it then
for when your husband's away.


478
00:33:28.662 --> 00:33:29.563
Wait, I don't...

479
00:33:29.596 --> 00:33:32.032
This weekend, while your husband's away.

480
00:33:32.065 --> 00:33:33.066
I don't know.

481
00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.368
Rick...

482
00:33:42.042 --> 00:33:43.042
Mmmm.

483
00:33:43.577 --> 00:33:44.978
No excuses.

484
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.280
You said yes.

485
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:50.549
Elise?

486
00:33:51.551 --> 00:33:52.753
- Who's that?
- Oh fuck.


487
00:33:52.786 --> 00:33:54.354
Oh my God, it's Rick PA.

488
00:33:54.388 --> 00:33:56.757
You need to leave now, go!

489
00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.091
I love you, Elise.

490
00:33:58.125 --> 00:34:00.027
- Yes, go, go, go, go!
- Do you love me?


491
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.295
What?

492
00:34:01.328 --> 00:34:02.372
Tell me you love
me or I won't go.

493
00:34:02.396 --> 00:34:03.597
Elise,

494
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:04.531
- are you in there?
- I won't leave.


495
00:34:04.564 --> 00:34:05.804
Okay, I love you, I love you.

496
00:34:15.275 --> 00:34:16.275
Tess.

497
00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.982
Please, please, please, don't tell Rick.

498
00:34:24.318 --> 00:34:25.786
Tell him what, Elise?

499
00:34:27.487 --> 00:34:28.488
Thank you.

500
00:34:29.723 --> 00:34:32.092
Look, if you ever
need to talk, I'm here.

501
00:34:32.125 --> 00:34:33.527
Okay?

502
00:34:38.598 --> 00:34:39.598
Bye.

503
00:34:51.812 --> 00:34:54.114
So, he told me that he loved me

504
00:34:54.147 --> 00:34:55.782
but then he made me say it back.

505
00:34:55.816 --> 00:34:58.151
You don't know, do you?

506
00:34:58.185 --> 00:34:59.786
No, no, of course not.

507
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.088
Are you sure?

508
00:35:01.121 --> 00:35:02.522
Yeah, I think so.

509
00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:06.760
So what's he like?

510
00:35:06.793 --> 00:35:08.395
Oh, he's amazing, yeah.

511
00:35:08.428 --> 00:35:11.164
I mean, he's not really your type but

512
00:35:11.198 --> 00:35:14.334
he's well built where it counts.

513
00:35:14.368 --> 00:35:15.369
Mmmmm.

514
00:35:15.402 --> 00:35:16.737
That's important.

515
00:35:21.274 --> 00:35:24.411
You know, I was thinking about

516
00:35:24.444 --> 00:35:27.114
taking up my acting career again.

517
00:35:27.147 --> 00:35:28.181
Oh, yeah?

518
00:35:29.716 --> 00:35:30.716
Well,

519
00:35:32.185 --> 00:35:34.388
be careful this time, okay?

520
00:35:34.421 --> 00:35:36.523
You got hurt really bad last time.

521
00:35:36.556 --> 00:35:40.060
I don't want you to get hurt
again, I really care about you.


522
00:35:42.496 --> 00:35:43.496
Yeah.

523
00:35:44.598 --> 00:35:45.699
You're right.

524
00:35:49.136 --> 00:35:51.371
So, well, we're experimenting this weekend.

525
00:35:51.405 --> 00:35:53.840
- Oh yeah?
- While Rick's away.


526
00:35:53.874 --> 00:35:55.509
Yeah, tell me more.

527
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.131
Oh my God!

528
00:36:20.267 --> 00:36:21.701
Who are you?

529
00:36:23.904 --> 00:36:26.239
Get the fuck out.

530
00:36:26.273 --> 00:36:28.608
I said get the fuck
out of my house now!

531
00:36:32.379 --> 00:36:33.379
Felix?

532
00:36:37.484 --> 00:36:39.352
You ready to explore, Elise?

533
00:36:42.189 --> 00:36:44.257
I wanna see you
get taken by another man

534
00:36:44.291 --> 00:36:46.226
in your husband's bath.

535
00:38:10.043 --> 00:38:11.912
Why are you sleeping with me?

536
00:38:14.915 --> 00:38:15.982
It's a long story.

537
00:38:17.617 --> 00:38:18.785
I have time.

538
00:38:20.987 --> 00:38:23.924
Well, I moved to
London when I was 16.

539
00:38:25.325 --> 00:38:26.493
For my acting career.

540
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.011
I was doing really, really cool shoots

541
00:38:35.035 --> 00:38:36.736
all over the world and stuff.

542
00:38:38.371 --> 00:38:43.276
And I met Rick here in
London at a networking event.


543
00:38:44.044 --> 00:38:46.313
He was a little bit older than me

544
00:38:46.346 --> 00:38:49.015
but he was a banker
and he had a great job

545
00:38:49.049 --> 00:38:51.251
and he was so charming.

546
00:38:53.553 --> 00:38:55.855
The age difference didn't
really matter to me.


547
00:38:57.657 --> 00:38:59.960
It was just something about him

548
00:38:59.993 --> 00:39:02.462
that made me, I just wanted him.

549
00:39:03.863 --> 00:39:05.398
Felt like I needed him.

550
00:39:06.366 --> 00:39:07.801
We had great sex.

551
00:39:08.835 --> 00:39:10.470
- Mmmmm.
- Just like this.


552
00:39:10.503 --> 00:39:12.839
- Just like this?
- Just like this.


553
00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:15.875
And we had a great relationship
based on great sex.


554
00:39:17.644 --> 00:39:18.644
But...

555
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.750
I don't know, after awhile I fell pregnant.

556
00:39:25.085 --> 00:39:26.920
And then what happened?

557
00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.993
Well, I was indifferent
about the pregnancy.


558
00:39:34.861 --> 00:39:37.764
But Rick, he wanted the baby.

559
00:39:38.932 --> 00:39:41.768
Seven months into the pregnancy, I...

560
00:39:44.504 --> 00:39:45.504
I lost it.

561
00:39:47.407 --> 00:39:48.541
I lost the baby.

562
00:39:50.877 --> 00:39:52.445
I'm sorry.

563
00:39:52.479 --> 00:39:54.047
No, don't be, it's...

564
00:39:56.483 --> 00:39:57.417
This stuff that happens, isn't it?

565
00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:58.485
Can't be helped.

566
00:39:59.085 --> 00:40:00.320
And now?

567
00:40:01.087 --> 00:40:01.888
Now?

568
00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:03.723
Mm-hmm?

569
00:40:03.757 --> 00:40:06.860
Now, okay, now I'm no longer a model.

570
00:40:06.893 --> 00:40:09.462
No longer have a career, no
longer having fun, no longer...


571
00:40:10.964 --> 00:40:12.766
No longer in love.

572
00:40:12.799 --> 00:40:13.867
Oh.

573
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.706
You know that day
we met in the cafe?

574
00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:20.739
How could I forget?

575
00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:25.712
I was following him to the
woman he's been sleeping with.


576
00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.780
Yep.

577
00:40:28.948 --> 00:40:30.717
I planned to confront him that day.

578
00:40:34.988 --> 00:40:35.988
What stopped you?

579
00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:39.859
I didn't have the facts.

580
00:40:42.462 --> 00:40:43.963
Would you have left him?

581
00:40:43.997 --> 00:40:45.565
Yeah, I was thinking about it.

582
00:40:48.935 --> 00:40:50.970
You deserve everything.

583
00:40:53.473 --> 00:40:54.974
Including this strawberry.

584
00:40:56.509 --> 00:40:57.444
Open.

585
00:40:57.477 --> 00:40:58.144
Why're you so messy?

586
00:40:58.178 --> 00:40:59.178
Open.

587
00:41:00.747 --> 00:41:01.648
Bite it.

588
00:41:01.681 --> 00:41:02.916
I bet it.

589
00:41:02.949 --> 00:41:03.983
Oh my God.

590
00:41:07.187 --> 00:41:09.956
Do you want to try something else?

591
00:41:09.989 --> 00:41:11.100
- What, now?
- Do you want to?


592
00:41:11.124 --> 00:41:12.759
- Now?
- Yeah.


593
00:41:12.792 --> 00:41:14.427
- Stay here.
- Wait!


594
00:41:14.461 --> 00:41:16.661
No, no, no, I don't think
I'm ready for anymore, Felix!


595
00:41:28.942 --> 00:41:29.942
Felix?

596
00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.647
Who are you?

597
00:41:34.681 --> 00:41:35.681
I'm Tom.

598
00:41:36.649 --> 00:41:37.917
You must be Elise.

599
00:41:39.886 --> 00:41:42.122
So what you think, Elise?

600
00:41:42.155 --> 00:41:45.558
Do you wanna try?

601
00:41:47.727 --> 00:41:48.862

Did you?

623
00:43:08.675 --> 00:43:10.610
What did you love about it?

624
00:43:16.182 --> 00:43:17.182
We should do it again.

625
00:43:18.785 --> 00:43:19.719
Fuck, it's Rick!

626
00:43:19.752 --> 00:43:20.752
Shit!

627
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:23.556
Oh, fuck.

628
00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:24.624
I just spent the night.

629
00:43:24.657 --> 00:43:25.657
- Go!
- Leave!


630
00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.329
Who's here?

631
00:43:29.362 --> 00:43:30.163
No one.

632
00:43:30.196 --> 00:43:31.698
Don't lie to me!

633
00:43:32.866 --> 00:43:34.334
Hi.

634
00:43:34.367 --> 00:43:36.669
Cheers, thank you.

635
00:43:36.703 --> 00:43:37.937
Felix.

636
00:43:37.971 --> 00:43:38.771
Good to meet you.

637
00:43:38.805 --> 00:43:40.206
Rick.

638
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.241
Good to meet you.

639
00:43:41.274 --> 00:43:42.609
I'm Elise's husband.

640
00:43:42.642 --> 00:43:43.652
We didn't know you'd be back so soon.

641
00:43:43.676 --> 00:43:46.112
We were just on the
rooftop taking some shots.


642
00:43:49.148 --> 00:43:50.148
Ah.

643
00:43:51.618 --> 00:43:52.886
Elise, I'm proud of you.

644
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:58.224
Let's have a look then.

645
00:43:58.258 --> 00:43:59.692
The photos.

646
00:43:59.726 --> 00:44:00.627
Oh, what do you think, Elise?

647
00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:01.628
Oh.

648
00:44:01.661 --> 00:44:03.096
Shout we show him?

649
00:44:05.632 --> 00:44:06.799
No, no, no, no,

650
00:44:08.268 --> 00:44:10.336
We'll have to wait until
they've been brushed up.


651
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:11.638
How was she?

652
00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:12.672
Still got it?

653
00:44:13.373 --> 00:44:16.576
Your wife is fetching.

654
00:44:18.945 --> 00:44:20.380
You know,

655
00:44:20.413 --> 00:44:22.982
I've told her numerous
times to take it up again.


656
00:44:23.016 --> 00:44:25.051
And I'm glad she finally listened.

657
00:44:27.654 --> 00:44:30.657
Anyway, I'll be seeing you
soon and great to meet you.


658
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:31.691
And you.

659
00:44:31.724 --> 00:44:32.759
See you.

660
00:44:33.893 --> 00:44:34.961
He's nice.

661
00:44:34.994 --> 00:44:39.999
Yeah.

662
00:44:55.048 --> 00:44:56.048
Oh.

663
00:44:58.117 --> 00:45:00.386
It's about time you turned up.

664
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.621
Wait, is Rick back?

665
00:45:02.855 --> 00:45:04.390
Calm down, he's not here.

666
00:45:04.424 --> 00:45:05.625
His assistant let me in.

667
00:45:06.893 --> 00:45:07.893
Thank God.

668
00:45:08.861 --> 00:45:10.396
You scared the hell out of me then.

669
00:45:11.798 --> 00:45:12.798
Seriously?

670
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.703
You do realize you missed
our lunch today, right?


671
00:45:18.104 --> 00:45:19.372
Oh, shit.

672
00:45:20.907 --> 00:45:22.809
B, I'm sorry, I completely forgot.

673
00:45:23.476 --> 00:45:24.711
So,

674
00:45:25.745 --> 00:45:26.679
where were you then?

675
00:45:26.713 --> 00:45:28.314
Assuming you weren't with Rick.

676
00:45:29.782 --> 00:45:31.050
No, I was...

677
00:45:32.485 --> 00:45:34.687
I was with Felix.

678
00:45:34.721 --> 00:45:36.923
You spend every living
second with that guy.


679
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:39.659
Seriously, what's going on?

680
00:45:41.461 --> 00:45:42.795
I thought it was a bit of fun

681
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:44.039
and you didn't like him like that.

682
00:45:44.063 --> 00:45:45.423
It is a bit of fun, I'm married.

683
00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.900
Well?

684
00:45:49.969 --> 00:45:51.471
You're blushing.

685
00:45:51.504 --> 00:45:54.173
And I know you.

686
00:45:54.207 --> 00:45:56.275
Sounds more than just a
bit of fun to me.

687
00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.078
So when's Rick actually gonna be home?

688
00:46:02.248 --> 00:46:04.450
I don't know, he's
probably out with clients


689
00:46:04.484 --> 00:46:06.686
or at the office, as usual.

690
00:46:07.854 --> 00:46:10.023
Well, I guess I best be going then.

691
00:46:10.056 --> 00:46:12.458
No, wait, don't do that,
you don't have to go.


692
00:46:12.492 --> 00:46:13.526
Come on, stay.

693
00:46:13.559 --> 00:46:16.429
I can get us some wine
and we can have catch up.


694
00:46:16.462 --> 00:46:17.462
Come on, look,

695
00:46:18.865 --> 00:46:19.865
Elise,

696
00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.745
I know what it's like to be
crushing on someone, okay?


697
00:46:22.769 --> 00:46:24.404
It's just,

698
00:46:24.437 --> 00:46:26.205
you're my best friend and

699
00:46:27.273 --> 00:46:28.775
you've just disappeared on me.

700
00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:34.079
Just...

701
00:46:35.515 --> 00:46:40.186
Give me a call when you
actually want and need me, okay?


702
00:46:41.287 --> 00:46:42.355
I'm gonna go.

703
00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.514
I love you.

704
00:47:08.548 --> 00:47:09.548
I know.

705
00:47:48.554 --> 00:47:49.355
Boo!

706
00:47:49.388 --> 00:47:50.957
Oh my God, Felix.

707
00:47:52.325 --> 00:47:53.893
How did you get in here?

708
00:47:53.926 --> 00:47:55.962
Oh, the door was open.

709
00:47:55.995 --> 00:47:58.331
- Why, what's the matter?
- God.


710
00:47:58.364 --> 00:48:00.466
Oh, I've missed you.

711
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:01.901
Felix, stop, stop, stop, stop.

712
00:48:01.934 --> 00:48:02.934
Stop, stop!

713
00:48:05.304 --> 00:48:06.304
What?

714
00:48:09.442 --> 00:48:13.212
I think we should go out
for a drink or something.


715
00:48:13.246 --> 00:48:14.947
I have something better planned.

716
00:48:15.982 --> 00:48:17.216
No, no 
- Come.

717
00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:18.184
No, no, no.

718
00:48:18.217 --> 00:48:19.152
With me.

719
00:48:19.185 --> 00:48:20.086
No.

720
00:48:20.119 --> 00:48:20.620
- Come on.
- No, no, no.


721
00:48:20.653 --> 00:48:21.888
No, no!

722
00:48:29.162 --> 00:48:30.162
What is this?

723
00:48:31.297 --> 00:48:32.398
Our next adventure.

724
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.300
Sit down.

725
00:48:39.672 --> 00:48:41.440
Meet

726
00:48:41.474 --> 00:48:42.508
- Mindy.
- Don't touch me!


727
00:48:42.542 --> 00:48:44.143
Get down there, you little slut!

728
00:48:46.979 --> 00:48:47.979
Quickly!

729
00:48:48.614 --> 00:48:50.850
Come on, join us.

730
00:48:53.352 --> 00:48:54.352
Ow.

731
00:48:55.922 --> 00:48:57.123
Do you like that, Elise?

732
00:48:58.124 --> 00:48:59.192
Do you like him in pain?

733
00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.328
You do, don't you?

734
00:49:03.496 --> 00:49:05.331
Do you wanna go?

735
00:49:05.364 --> 00:49:06.399
He likes it.

736
00:49:09.602 --> 00:49:11.103
Here, you have it.

737
00:49:13.206 --> 00:49:14.574
Come on!

738
00:49:25.184 --> 00:49:25.985
Good girl.

739
00:49:26.018 --> 00:49:27.119
A bit harder.

740
00:49:29.488 --> 00:49:32.191
Come on, you can do better than that.

741
00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:39.250
Oi.

742
00:51:40.753 --> 00:51:42.321
Oi.

743
00:51:42.355 --> 00:51:43.622
Come here.

744
00:51:49.528 --> 00:51:50.528
What's the matter?

745
00:51:53.399 --> 00:51:56.268
I don't know if this is
something that I want anymore.


746
00:51:56.302 --> 00:51:57.436
Why?

747
00:51:59.605 --> 00:52:02.108
Well, I don't know what
I thought this was but


748
00:52:02.141 --> 00:52:04.477
it's all gone completely
out of control and I,


749
00:52:05.678 --> 00:52:07.780
I just think I should
go back to my husband.


750
00:52:09.315 --> 00:52:11.250
It's because of the girl.

751
00:52:11.283 --> 00:52:12.451
No.

752
00:52:12.485 --> 00:52:14.162
I've seen four men
take you in front of me.


753
00:52:14.186 --> 00:52:14.854
I do it for the first
time and that's a problem?


754
00:52:14.887 --> 00:52:16.188
No, Felix.

755
00:52:16.222 --> 00:52:18.057
She's not the problem, we are.

756
00:52:21.227 --> 00:52:23.129
I needed to speak to you today because

757
00:52:25.865 --> 00:52:27.299
I had a pregnancy scare

758
00:52:28.868 --> 00:52:30.236
and if it had been positive,

759
00:52:30.269 --> 00:52:32.872
I would've known who the father was.

760
00:52:32.905 --> 00:52:35.708
So, I think it's just time
that this little fantasy ended


761
00:52:35.741 --> 00:52:36.752
before it gets out of control.

762
00:52:36.776 --> 00:52:38.144
You told me you loved me.

763
00:52:39.845 --> 00:52:40.746
No I didn't.

764
00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.115
You told me in your house.

765
00:52:47.153 --> 00:52:48.287
Oh, Felix, no.

766
00:52:49.688 --> 00:52:52.158
No, no, no, you made me say that.

767
00:52:53.726 --> 00:52:55.227
You made me, you wouldn't leave.

768
00:52:55.261 --> 00:52:57.530
We would've been caught,
what was I supposed to do?


769
00:53:00.366 --> 00:53:01.867
Felix, look, I'm married, okay?

770
00:53:01.901 --> 00:53:03.502
You knew this about me.

771
00:53:05.905 --> 00:53:07.540
I can't give you what you want

772
00:53:07.573 --> 00:53:10.576
and it's not fair to continue
this any longer on anyone.


773
00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:11.510
No, I know what you want!

774
00:53:11.544 --> 00:53:12.511
No.

775
00:53:12.545 --> 00:53:13.785
I know what you want, I know!

776
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.924
You felt threatened because of the girl.

777
00:53:15.948 --> 00:53:16.882
- No.
- That's what it was.


778
00:53:16.916 --> 00:53:18.160
I can give you what you
want, you know I can!


779
00:53:18.184 --> 00:53:19.151
I love you so much!

780
00:53:19.185 --> 00:53:20.653
No, please, stop.

781
00:53:22.221 --> 00:53:23.456
No, listen to me!

782
00:53:23.489 --> 00:53:24.824
I can give you what you desire.

783
00:53:24.857 --> 00:53:26.225
Oh, Felix, no.

784
00:53:28.427 --> 00:53:29.662
Now get on the bed!

785
00:53:29.695 --> 00:53:30.729
Felix!

786
00:53:30.763 --> 00:53:32.164
No!

787
00:53:32.932 --> 00:53:36.202
Please!

788
00:53:36.235 --> 00:53:37.470
What the fuck is going on?

789
00:53:37.503 --> 00:53:39.271
Get the fuck off her!

790
00:53:39.305 --> 00:53:40.306
Are you all right?

791
00:53:40.339 --> 00:53:42.575
What the fuck is wrong with you?

792
00:53:42.608 --> 00:53:45.177
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

793
00:53:48.948 --> 00:53:50.683
Get the fuck out.

794
00:53:50.716 --> 00:53:51.917
You heard her, get out.

795
00:53:51.951 --> 00:53:52.485
If you don't leave in the next minute,

796
00:53:52.518 --> 00:53:53.686
I'm calling the police.

797
00:53:56.222 --> 00:53:57.690
I'm going.

798
00:54:01.927 --> 00:54:04.430
You need to keep away
from that kind, all right?


799
00:54:05.397 --> 00:54:07.166
It's not fucking worth it, is it?

800
00:54:11.537 --> 00:54:14.173
- Thank you.
- It's all right.


801
00:54:24.884 --> 00:54:26.218
Elise?

802
00:54:26.252 --> 00:54:27.353
Did that guy hurt you?

803
00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:33.292
Leave it, Tess.

804
00:54:33.325 --> 00:54:35.394
Elise, you need to end it with him.

805
00:54:35.427 --> 00:54:36.996
Good guys don't do stuff like that.

806
00:54:37.029 --> 00:54:38.631
I have ended it with him.

807
00:54:38.664 --> 00:54:39.664
Good.

808
00:54:41.534 --> 00:54:44.003
Let's just say he
didn't take it very well.

809
00:54:44.036 --> 00:54:46.405
You gotta be careful.

810
00:54:46.438 --> 00:54:47.706
Yeah, I know.

811
00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:50.876
Don't worry.

812
00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:52.878
I'm fine.

813
00:54:52.912 --> 00:54:53.979
Good.

814
00:54:54.013 --> 00:54:54.813
Yeah.

815
00:54:54.847 --> 00:54:56.482
It's just,

816
00:54:56.515 --> 00:54:58.951
I hope I never see him again.

817
00:54:58.984 --> 00:54:59.885
Yeah.

818
00:54:59.919 --> 00:55:00.919
Hopefully.

819
00:55:03.389 --> 00:55:04.723
Ready?

820
00:55:04.757 --> 00:55:06.358
Yeah, I think so.

821
00:55:07.493 --> 00:55:10.396
You look like a million dollars.

822
00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:12.665
Thank you.

823
00:55:12.698 --> 00:55:13.699
I'll be right back.

824
00:55:13.732 --> 00:55:15.367
Okay.

825
00:55:37.056 --> 00:55:38.591
- Honey?
- Yeah?


826
00:55:38.624 --> 00:55:39.959
Why is Felix here?

827
00:55:39.992 --> 00:55:42.494
Well, you wanted someone here, so,

828
00:55:42.528 --> 00:55:45.030
I want you to have someone.

829
00:55:45.064 --> 00:55:48.267
Bianca wasn't free, so, take a seat.

830
00:55:55.074 --> 00:55:56.542
Elise.

831
00:55:56.575 --> 00:55:58.744
You look stunning, Elise.

832
00:55:59.612 --> 00:56:01.080
Hey, you okay?

833
00:56:01.113 --> 00:56:02.448
Thanks for inviting me.

834
00:56:04.383 --> 00:56:06.619
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know, right?


835
00:56:06.652 --> 00:56:08.554
Sorry, John, have you met my wife, Elise?

836
00:56:08.587 --> 00:56:09.622
Elise, this is John.

837
00:56:10.522 --> 00:56:12.391
They've met before, no?

838
00:56:15.761 --> 00:56:16.862
Elise!

839
00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:19.031
Oh, hey!

840
00:56:19.064 --> 00:56:19.999
How are you?

841
00:56:20.032 --> 00:56:21.000
Good, how are you?

842
00:56:21.033 --> 00:56:21.967
Ages ago.

843
00:56:22.001 --> 00:56:23.335
Yeah.

844
00:56:23.369 --> 00:56:24.069
- You look great.
- It's good to see you.


845
00:56:24.103 --> 00:56:24.903
I love the dress.

846
00:56:24.937 --> 00:56:26.372
Thanks.

847
00:56:26.405 --> 00:56:27.673
And who are you?

848
00:56:27.706 --> 00:56:30.075
Kept him a secret, didn't you?

849
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.909
Felix.

850
00:56:30.943 --> 00:56:32.344
Tara.

851
00:56:32.378 --> 00:56:32.945
Great to meet you, Tara.

852
00:56:32.978 --> 00:56:35.447
Nice to meet you too.

853
00:56:35.481 --> 00:56:37.383
You have gorgeous eyes.

854
00:56:38.984 --> 00:56:40.386
Oh.

855
00:56:40.419 --> 00:56:41.220
You sure know how to flatter a girl.

856
00:56:41.253 --> 00:56:43.389
I flatter the ones I want, yeah.

857
00:56:43.422 --> 00:56:45.090
Oh, really?

858
00:56:45.124 --> 00:56:47.126
And those who don't?

859
00:56:47.159 --> 00:56:50.029
You do not want
to be one of those.

860
00:56:51.397 --> 00:56:52.231
Cheers, girls.

861
00:56:52.264 --> 00:56:54.366
Cheers.

862
00:58:01.533 --> 00:58:02.911
Elise, what's next for you and Rick

863
00:58:02.935 --> 00:58:05.738
now that his contract's terminating?

864
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:19.485
Elise?

865
00:58:19.518 --> 00:58:20.652
Yeah, sorry.

866
00:58:20.686 --> 00:58:22.855
I said, what's next for you and Rick

867
00:58:22.888 --> 00:58:24.957
now that his contract is terminating?

868
00:58:26.825 --> 00:58:29.161
What do you mean?

869
00:58:29.194 --> 00:58:30.562
Yeah.

870
00:58:30.596 --> 00:58:32.831
Actually, that is what tonight is about.

871
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.003
I've actually called
it quits at me old job.


872
00:58:39.605 --> 00:58:40.605
And...

873
00:58:41.507 --> 00:58:42.875
So I can focus,

874
00:58:44.009 --> 00:58:45.711
take something a bit more manageable.

875
00:58:46.512 --> 00:58:47.846
With less hours.

876
00:58:50.149 --> 00:58:51.150
Less stress.

877
00:58:52.651 --> 00:58:54.887
So I can focus more time at home.

878
00:58:55.754 --> 00:58:58.257
Ah.

879
00:58:58.290 --> 00:58:59.591
That's sweet of you.

880
00:58:59.625 --> 00:59:01.627
Excuse me, I need the toilet.

881
00:59:05.664 --> 00:59:07.566
I'll go and see if she's okay.

882
00:59:17.209 --> 00:59:18.610
Why're you so tense?

883
00:59:18.644 --> 00:59:19.687
You have people sitting
at a table out there.


884
00:59:19.711 --> 00:59:21.980
Felix, you did that right
in front of my husband.


885
00:59:22.014 --> 00:59:23.224
It was hot though, right, you enjoyed it.

886
00:59:23.248 --> 00:59:25.818
Are you not listening to
anything I've been saying to you?


887
00:59:26.852 --> 00:59:28.954
That was far too close!

888
00:59:28.987 --> 00:59:29.987
Never again.

889
00:59:31.256 --> 00:59:32.256
Never say never.

890
00:59:34.059 --> 00:59:35.527
This isn't some game, Felix.

891
00:59:35.561 --> 00:59:36.995
Okay, this is my life.

892
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.830
Your life?

893
00:59:37.863 --> 00:59:39.097
Yes, my life!

894
00:59:39.131 --> 00:59:40.999
Your life, let me tell you something.

895
00:59:41.033 --> 00:59:43.278
Your life's about to get a
whole lot more interesting now.


896
00:59:43.302 --> 00:59:44.102
Do you understand?

897
00:59:44.136 --> 00:59:45.037
Get off me!

898
00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:46.181
Don't speak to me like that!

899
00:59:46.205 --> 00:59:48.073
Who do you think you are?

900
00:59:49.675 --> 00:59:51.610
Felix, you fucking assaulted me!

901
00:59:51.643 --> 00:59:52.644
Kiss me.

902
00:59:52.678 --> 00:59:53.579
No!

903
00:59:53.612 --> 00:59:54.880
Get your fucking hands off me!

904
00:59:54.913 --> 00:59:57.216
Get off me, you fucking creep!

905
01:00:02.721 --> 01:00:04.790
She was just...

906
01:00:04.823 --> 01:00:05.823
Elise.

907
01:00:07.726 --> 01:00:09.661
Your husband is a very hard worker.

908
01:00:09.695 --> 01:00:11.597
We'll be sad to see him go.

909
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:12.698
You're a lucky girl.

910
01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:17.636
And the men's bathroom is the
other side of the restaurant.


911
01:00:18.604 --> 01:00:20.639
I just came to see
if she was all right.

912
01:00:26.345 --> 01:00:29.581
I don't think you realize
just how lucky you are.


913
01:00:29.615 --> 01:00:31.583
Now you may think that you have everything

914
01:00:31.617 --> 01:00:34.653
but you can lose it just
as quickly as you got it.


915
01:00:38.123 --> 01:00:40.268
Rick is a dear friend of mine,
and I don't think he knows


916
01:00:40.292 --> 01:00:41.936
about these silly little
games that you're playing.


917
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.663
But when he finds out,
there will be hell to pay.


918
01:00:46.632 --> 01:00:49.935
And as a loyal colleague,
I have my suspicions.


919
01:00:51.837 --> 01:00:53.171
You better watch your back.

920
01:00:54.873 --> 01:00:55.873
Janet?

921
01:01:06.285 --> 01:01:07.085
We're heading off.

922
01:01:07.119 --> 01:01:08.987
I've gotta go.

923
01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:09.955
Elise, you okay?

924
01:01:09.988 --> 01:01:11.089
Yeah, yeah.

925
01:01:12.024 --> 01:01:13.191
Rick will be back in a sec.

926
01:01:13.225 --> 01:01:14.702
He's just seeing some of the others off.

927
01:01:14.726 --> 01:01:17.629
Yeah, no, it's fine,
I'll just, I'll wait.


928
01:01:17.663 --> 01:01:18.973
If you ever need anything, I'm here.

929
01:01:18.997 --> 01:01:19.997
Okay, I mean it.

930
01:01:21.433 --> 01:01:22.234
Thanks.

931
01:01:22.267 --> 01:01:23.402
Bye.

932
01:01:23.435 --> 01:01:24.670
Bye.

933
01:01:33.045 --> 01:01:34.947
Looks like they got lucky after all.

934
01:01:41.753 --> 01:01:42.754
After you, my lady.

935
01:01:56.735 --> 01:01:57.736
Oh.

936
01:01:59.438 --> 01:02:00.639
Thank you.

937
01:02:04.176 --> 01:02:06.178
Is that our best champagne?

938
01:02:06.211 --> 01:02:07.379
Maybe.

939
01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:14.319
Oh, Rick, quick, the suspense.

940
01:02:14.353 --> 01:02:19.358
Oh!

941
01:02:20.492 --> 01:02:22.260
Looks like I'm all yours now.

942
01:02:24.963 --> 01:02:27.065
Rick, your didn't have to quit your job.

943
01:02:27.966 --> 01:02:29.768
Why, Elise?

944
01:02:29.801 --> 01:02:33.005
The job didn't make me happy anymore.

945
01:02:34.373 --> 01:02:36.441
I need some time out to rethink things.

946
01:02:38.844 --> 01:02:41.747
And I realized that if I
stayed there, you would...


947
01:02:43.015 --> 01:02:44.015
I would lose you.

948
01:02:45.884 --> 01:02:50.889
And you are the most
important thing in my life.


949
01:02:57.996 --> 01:02:58.864
Cheers.

950
01:02:58.897 --> 01:03:00.432
What's this?

951
01:03:02.401 --> 01:03:03.969
I love you.

952
01:03:04.002 --> 01:03:05.103

Oh.

Weird.

01:06:07.252 --> 01:06:08.252
Ah.

994
01:06:10.388 --> 01:06:13.692
That solves the mystery of the remote.

995
01:06:13.725 --> 01:06:14.960
Do you know what?

996
01:06:14.993 --> 01:06:16.194
I think it's Bianca.

997
01:06:17.362 --> 01:06:19.106
She must've taken it by
accident the other day


998
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:21.199
when she was around here.

999
01:06:21.233 --> 01:06:22.233
Bianca was here?

1000
01:06:23.101 --> 01:06:25.670
Yeah, yeah, she popped
around the other day.


1001
01:06:25.704 --> 01:06:29.341
Well.

1002
01:06:32.043 --> 01:06:33.043
That solves that then.

1003
01:06:34.446 --> 01:06:37.382
Where would my beautiful wife
like me to take her today?


1004
01:06:40.585 --> 01:06:43.588
Actually, I kind of have
somewhere I need to be.


1005
01:06:43.622 --> 01:06:44.623
Hmmm?

1006
01:06:44.656 --> 01:06:45.656
Oh yeah?

1007
01:06:48.526 --> 01:06:52.464
I have a casting this
afternoon with Leila.


1008
01:06:55.233 --> 01:06:56.268
Elise Styles?

1009
01:06:56.301 --> 01:06:57.202
Yes.

1010
01:06:57.235 --> 01:06:58.355
They're ready for you now.

1011
01:07:00.405 --> 01:07:01.405
Thank you.

1012
01:07:09.214 --> 01:07:11.049
Hello there, James.

1013
01:07:11.082 --> 01:07:12.017
- I'm Elise.
- You are?


1014
01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:13.251
- Elise.
- Hi.


1015
01:07:13.285 --> 01:07:14.085
Hello.

1016
01:07:14.119 --> 01:07:16.354
- This is Leila.
- Hi.


1017
01:07:16.388 --> 01:07:17.188
How are you?

1018
01:07:17.222 --> 01:07:18.156
Good, how are you?

1019
01:07:18.189 --> 01:07:19.357
Good, thanks.

1020
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:20.434
Thank you, good to see you.

1021
01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:22.027
- Please.
- Good to see you too.


1022
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.528
Thank you.

1023
01:07:27.165 --> 01:07:30.068
So, thank you for coming in today.

1024
01:07:30.101 --> 01:07:34.039
As you know, Leila is
casting for her new client.


1025
01:07:34.072 --> 01:07:37.142
It's a very hip, young and
current brand of fragrance.


1026
01:07:37.175 --> 01:07:39.411
So the aim of this
casting is to find a girl


1027
01:07:39.444 --> 01:07:41.713
who best matches that brand.

1028
01:07:44.616 --> 01:07:45.784
This is your portfolio?

1029
01:07:45.817 --> 01:07:48.153
The agent sent it across
to us earlier today.


1030
01:07:48.186 --> 01:07:49.587
Yep, that's correct.

1031
01:07:49.621 --> 01:07:51.723
So we'll see what we've got, shall we?

1032
01:07:51.756 --> 01:07:54.492
I actually did something
similar to this brand


1033
01:07:54.526 --> 01:07:55.593
that you were describing.

1034
01:07:55.627 --> 01:07:58.396
It's just in the middle
of the book for reference.


1035
01:08:00.231 --> 01:08:03.168
Of course, some of the images
are a couple of years old.


1036
01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.656
Sorry, is there something wrong?

1037
01:08:24.689 --> 01:08:26.091
Sorry, it's...

1038
01:08:26.858 --> 01:08:28.326
It's not what we're after.

1039
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.761
No.

1040
01:08:29.794 --> 01:08:31.954
I'm sorry, we're not looking
for that kind of model.


1041
01:08:35.333 --> 01:08:38.169
Thank you for your time.

1042
01:08:53.585 --> 01:08:54.585
Oh my God.

1043
01:09:29.254 --> 01:09:30.254
Oh my...

1044
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:39.930
Shit!

1045
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.911
You didn't reply to my texts.

1046
01:09:43.935 --> 01:09:45.603
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1047
01:09:45.637 --> 01:09:46.747
Oh, so you got the message then?

1048
01:09:46.771 --> 01:09:49.274
The message, what do you
mean, the fucking message?


1049
01:09:49.307 --> 01:09:50.508
Oh.

1050
01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:51.819
You look so hot when you're angry.

1051
01:09:51.843 --> 01:09:53.344
- Do you know that?
- Oh, Felix!


1052
01:09:53.378 --> 01:09:54.179
So hot.

1053
01:09:54.212 --> 01:09:55.413
Get off me!

1054
01:09:55.447 --> 01:09:58.183
I am sick and tired of
these silly games, okay?


1055
01:09:59.284 --> 01:10:00.285
I'm not gonna leave him.

1056
01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.164
And you listen to me, if you try...

1057
01:10:03.188 --> 01:10:04.389
No, you listen to me!

1058
01:10:05.857 --> 01:10:06.901
You'll do everything that
I fucking tell you to do,


1059
01:10:06.925 --> 01:10:08.293
otherwise I'll show your husband

1060
01:10:08.326 --> 01:10:10.328
everything you've done behind his back!

1061
01:10:10.361 --> 01:10:11.361
All of these!

1062
01:10:12.397 --> 01:10:14.299
Do you understand?

1063
01:10:14.332 --> 01:10:16.468
You'll do as I say or
I show him everything!


1064
01:10:18.303 --> 01:10:19.838
You don't have the power here, I do.

1065
01:10:19.871 --> 01:10:20.672
Do you understand?

1066
01:10:20.705 --> 01:10:21.506
I do.

1067
01:10:21.539 --> 01:10:22.807
You are mine.

1068
01:10:22.841 --> 01:10:24.909
You don't have anyone anymore.

1069
01:10:24.943 --> 01:10:26.387
And if your husband has
seen what you've become,


1070
01:10:26.411 --> 01:10:27.812
he wouldn't want you either.

1071
01:10:29.247 --> 01:10:32.250
You allowed men you don't know fuck you.

1072
01:10:33.518 --> 01:10:34.595
You allowed yourself to do things

1073
01:10:34.619 --> 01:10:36.221
that no other woman would allow.

1074
01:10:37.322 --> 01:10:38.790
You have no respect for yourself!

1075
01:10:43.795 --> 01:10:45.463
- I'm gonna show Rick...
- No.


1076
01:10:45.497 --> 01:10:46.731
These discs.

1077
01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:47.908
He'll see you for what you really are.

1078
01:10:47.932 --> 01:10:49.252
A fucking disgusting little slut!

1079
01:10:51.469 --> 01:10:52.837
Tomorrow,

1080
01:10:52.871 --> 01:10:53.981
I'll tell you where to be and when.

1081
01:10:54.005 --> 01:10:57.275
You'll do one more thing
for me and this is all over.


1082
01:10:57.308 --> 01:10:58.308
No.

1083
01:10:59.944 --> 01:11:00.944
Now you can leave.

1084
01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:02.881
Go on!

1085
01:11:02.914 --> 01:11:04.549
Get the fuck out of here!

1086
01:11:07.285 --> 01:11:10.255
And until then, I'll get
that Mindy around again.


1087
01:11:10.288 --> 01:11:12.290
She's a better fuck than you anyway.

1088
01:11:53.398 --> 01:11:54.398
Stay here.

1089
01:11:57.702 --> 01:11:58.503
No.

1090
01:11:58.536 --> 01:11:59.871
Are you ready?

1091
01:12:13.518 --> 01:12:15.320
I only wanna hear you say one thing.

1092
01:12:18.756 --> 01:12:20.358
One word,

1093
01:12:20.391 --> 01:12:21.893
and that's yes.

1094
01:12:22.927 --> 01:12:23.927
Okay?

1095
01:12:25.663 --> 01:12:28.600
Anything else, 
I'll tell Rick.

1096
01:12:33.404 --> 01:12:34.439
Ready?

1097
01:12:39.844 --> 01:12:41.045
Surprise.

1098
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:57.362
Get on the bed.

1099
01:12:57.395 --> 01:12:58.930
Get

1100
01:12:58.963 --> 01:12:59.963
on

1101
01:13:01.432 --> 01:13:02.433
The bed.

1102
01:13:29.627 --> 01:13:31.462
She's all yours, boys.

1103
01:13:33.431 --> 01:13:34.431
Hello, darling.

1104
01:13:44.609 --> 01:13:45.410
No.

1105
01:13:45.443 --> 01:13:46.477
No.

1106
01:13:46.511 --> 01:13:47.511
No, no.

1107
01:14:00.858 --> 01:14:02.427
Do you like that, Elise?

1108
01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:03.895
Are you sure you want this?

1109
01:14:06.097 --> 01:14:08.366
Do you

1110
01:14:09.167 --> 01:14:10.167
like that?

1111
01:14:10.868 --> 01:14:12.503
Yes.

1112
01:14:12.537 --> 01:14:13.538
I can't hear you.

1113
01:14:18.543 --> 01:14:20.478
She takes it good.

1114
01:14:20.511 --> 01:14:21.679
Yes.

1115
01:14:34.992 --> 01:14:35.992
Go harder on her.

1116
01:14:37.195 --> 01:14:38.629
Go on!

1117
01:14:51.909 --> 01:14:54.178
I'll fucking show you how it's done.

1118
01:14:54.212 --> 01:14:56.814
I'll fucking break you!

1119
01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:00.485
I'll fucking break you.

1120
01:15:07.792 --> 01:15:09.794
Move over, Kyle, my turn.

1121
01:15:17.902 --> 01:15:21.539
Now, I want you to do one
more thing for me and that's it.


1122
01:15:21.572 --> 01:15:22.572
No.

1123
01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:25.719
No, you said this
would be the last thing.

1124
01:15:25.743 --> 01:15:27.245
No, I didn't.

1125
01:15:27.278 --> 01:15:28.546
Yes you did.

1126
01:15:28.579 --> 01:15:29.747
No, I didn't.

1127
01:15:29.781 --> 01:15:31.048
One more think.

1128
01:15:33.651 --> 01:15:35.553
Do you

1129
01:15:36.687 --> 01:15:38.055
like that?

1130
01:15:38.089 --> 01:15:40.925
Yes.

1131
01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:42.260
I can't hear you.

1132
01:15:42.293 --> 01:15:43.761
I said, yes!

1133
01:15:59.644 --> 01:16:01.479
Same time, same place tomorrow.

1134
01:16:02.547 --> 01:16:03.547
You disgust me.

1135
01:16:05.016 --> 01:16:06.651
I'll tell Rick.

1136
01:16:21.999 --> 01:16:24.068
Where you going?

1137
01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:26.170
Not if I tell him first.

1138
01:16:26.204 --> 01:16:27.204
Fucking bitch!

1139
01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.908
Put your clothes on.

1140
01:16:30.942 --> 01:16:32.543
Get out.

1141
01:16:32.577 --> 01:16:37.582
I said put your clothes on!

1142
01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:43.119
Elise.

1143
01:16:44.355 --> 01:16:45.957
I wasn't expecting you back.

1144
01:16:49.894 --> 01:16:52.797
I thought you'd be out
living the life of luxury.


1145
01:16:56.701 --> 01:16:57.735
Rick, I found it.

1146
01:17:02.773 --> 01:17:03.773
So,

1147
01:17:04.609 --> 01:17:06.310
have you heard?

1148
01:17:06.344 --> 01:17:10.781
Rick has signed all of the
papers and everything over


1149
01:17:10.815 --> 01:17:13.818
and it looks like I'll
be filling in for him.


1150
01:17:13.851 --> 01:17:15.586
I mean, it's a shame, really,

1151
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:17.688
that he's given up everything to be with

1152
01:17:17.722 --> 01:17:21.792
such a deceitful, unworthy slut.

1153
01:17:24.729 --> 01:17:29.033
But hey, ho, life shits on you
sometimes, what can you do?


1154
01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:31.168
Have a great life, Elise.

1155
01:17:31.202 --> 01:17:32.670
Well,

1156
01:17:32.703 --> 01:17:33.703
whatever's left of it.

1157
01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.640
Janet?

1158
01:17:40.778 --> 01:17:42.880
Get the fuck out of my house.

1159
01:17:44.415 --> 01:17:45.415
Now.

1160
01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:01.065
Elise, what are you doing in here?

1161
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.337
What's the matter, what's happened?

1162
01:18:10.975 --> 01:18:12.109
Rick.

1163
01:18:12.143 --> 01:18:13.744
I'm sorry.

1164
01:18:13.778 --> 01:18:15.846
- Come on.
- I'm so sorry.


1165
01:18:23.454 --> 01:18:25.089
I have to tell you something.

1166
01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.795
All right.

1167
01:18:34.398 --> 01:18:35.399
I've been a bad person.

1168
01:18:35.433 --> 01:18:38.002
I'm so, so sorry.

1169
01:18:38.035 --> 01:18:39.704
What is it?

1170
01:18:40.805 --> 01:18:41.805
Huh?

1171
01:18:45.943 --> 01:18:48.879
I need to, I need to
ask you something, okay,


1172
01:18:48.913 --> 01:18:51.716
and I need you to be
completely honest with me


1173
01:18:51.749 --> 01:18:53.117
and tell me the truth.

1174
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:57.321
Okay.

1175
01:18:57.355 --> 01:18:59.156
Have you been having an affair?

1176
01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:00.358
Elise.

1177
01:19:00.391 --> 01:19:02.026
Please, just tell me the truth.

1178
01:19:02.059 --> 01:19:03.427
Of course not.

1179
01:19:04.862 --> 01:19:06.864
Who have you been talking to?

1180
01:19:06.897 --> 01:19:08.432
What is this?

1181
01:19:08.466 --> 01:19:09.700
Huh?

1182
01:19:13.337 --> 01:19:14.905
I cheated on you.

1183
01:19:17.141 --> 01:19:18.141
What?

1184
01:19:20.111 --> 01:19:21.812
- Rick, I'm sorry.
- Elise, no.


1185
01:19:21.846 --> 01:19:23.280
I'm sorry.

1186
01:19:23.314 --> 01:19:24.314
I'm sorry.

1187
01:19:27.952 --> 01:19:30.054
Rick, come sit down.

1188
01:19:30.087 --> 01:19:31.455
Who?

1189
01:19:31.489 --> 01:19:32.823
Who was it?

1190
01:19:35.493 --> 01:19:36.927
It was Felix.

1191
01:19:38.896 --> 01:19:39.896
Felix?

1192
01:19:41.499 --> 01:19:42.366
I'm sorry.

1193
01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.402
Rick, I'm sorry, it didn't mean anything.

1194
01:19:46.303 --> 01:19:47.505
How long?

1195
01:19:47.538 --> 01:19:48.706
How long?

1196
01:19:50.074 --> 01:19:54.145
I don't know, the past
could of months or something.


1197
01:20:00.551 --> 01:20:03.387
Don't look at me like that.

1198
01:20:08.893 --> 01:20:10.804
Did you like it more with
him than you did with me?


1199
01:20:10.828 --> 01:20:11.828
No, no.

1200
01:20:12.863 --> 01:20:13.531
Please, Rick.

1201
01:20:13.564 --> 01:20:14.799
Please.

1202
01:20:15.533 --> 01:20:17.868
Was it just with him?

1203
01:20:23.307 --> 01:20:24.307
No.

1204
01:20:27.278 --> 01:20:28.512
How many men?

1205
01:20:30.815 --> 01:20:32.049
I don't know.

1206
01:20:32.083 --> 01:20:33.350
You are horrific.

1207
01:20:33.384 --> 01:20:35.820
No, don't say that.

1208
01:20:35.853 --> 01:20:37.855
I'm gonna stay in a hotel this evening.

1209
01:20:37.888 --> 01:20:38.522
No, no!

1210
01:20:38.556 --> 01:20:39.957
And you are gonna

1211
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.791
- pack your things...
- No, please.


1212
01:20:40.825 --> 01:20:41.392
And you are to go.

1213
01:20:41.425 --> 01:20:42.860
No.

1214
01:20:42.893 --> 01:20:43.828
I want you out of this house.

1215
01:20:43.861 --> 01:20:45.029
No.

1216
01:20:45.062 --> 01:20:46.530
I want you...

1217
01:20:46.564 --> 01:20:47.364
- No, please.
- Gone!


1218
01:20:47.398 --> 01:20:48.966
Don't say that.

1219
01:20:48.999 --> 01:20:49.999
Rick, don't!

1220
01:20:54.238 --> 01:20:56.774
It all just got completely out of control.

1221
01:20:57.575 --> 01:20:59.243
He had this group of men there

1222
01:21:01.445 --> 01:21:02.780
waiting for me.

1223
01:21:03.547 --> 01:21:04.648
No.

1224
01:21:04.682 --> 01:21:08.085
He said, he said that if
I went through with it that


1225
01:21:09.487 --> 01:21:12.056
he would leave me alone,
that would be the end of it


1226
01:21:12.089 --> 01:21:16.894
and the secret would be
safe with him but I know...


1227
01:21:16.927 --> 01:21:18.847
I know it's not the end
with him, he won't stop.


1228
01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:21.131
He won't.

1229
01:21:23.634 --> 01:21:25.245
Like what kind of
a person would do that?

1230
01:21:25.269 --> 01:21:28.139
What kind of a person would
actually agree to that


1231
01:21:28.172 --> 01:21:29.607
and go through with it just to keep

1232
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.910
a dirty, horrible lie from your husband?

1233
01:21:32.943 --> 01:21:34.378
Go stay at a friend's house.

1234
01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:35.613
Stay somewhere safe, you know,

1235
01:21:35.646 --> 01:21:37.915
with someone who can give you support.

1236
01:21:37.948 --> 01:21:39.016
Okay?

1237
01:21:39.049 --> 01:21:40.384
I know Rick loves you

1238
01:21:40.417 --> 01:21:42.586
and after all of, everything that you two

1239
01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:44.388
have been through together,

1240
01:21:44.421 --> 01:21:46.557
I know that you're both
gonna get through it!


1241
01:21:48.125 --> 01:21:49.125
Okay?

1242
01:21:52.029 --> 01:21:54.899
- Thank you.
- Come here.


1243
01:21:54.932 --> 01:21:56.167
You're fine.

1244
01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.560
You're gonna get through it, okay?

1245
01:21:59.303 --> 01:22:01.939
Look, I have to go
but thank you so much.

1246
01:22:01.972 --> 01:22:04.975
Look after yourself, okay?

1247
01:22:09.313 --> 01:22:10.313
B?

1248
01:22:21.959 --> 01:22:22.993
B?

1249
01:22:52.156 --> 01:22:53.156
Rick?

1250
01:23:21.685 --> 01:23:22.685
Oh my God!

1251
01:23:24.255 --> 01:23:25.389
Rick!

1252
01:23:25.422 --> 01:23:26.957
Rick, are you all right?

1253
01:23:26.991 --> 01:23:27.992
Speak to me.

1254
01:23:28.025 --> 01:23:29.025
Speak to me.

1255
01:23:34.765 --> 01:23:36.400
Got the message.

1256
01:23:36.433 --> 01:23:38.969
Felix, what have you done?

1257
01:23:42.573 --> 01:23:43.573
Sit down.

1258
01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:47.710
Sit down.

1259
01:23:59.256 --> 01:24:00.958
These are bad people.

1260
01:24:03.327 --> 01:24:05.462
Do you know what
they were doing all along?

1261
01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:08.132
Sneaking around behind your back.

1262
01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.711
All those worries of this one
sleeping with another woman,


1263
01:24:11.735 --> 01:24:14.038
while ding-dong, you were right.

1264
01:24:14.071 --> 01:24:15.172
It was this bitch.

1265
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:21.011
Is this true?

1266
01:24:33.157 --> 01:24:34.157
Do you see it now?

1267
01:24:35.693 --> 01:24:36.693
Huh?

1268
01:24:38.162 --> 01:24:39.029
I'm the only one who's every been here

1269
01:24:39.063 --> 01:24:40.264
for you this whole time.

1270
01:24:44.068 --> 01:24:47.004
Since that day I saw you at Bianca's.

1271
01:24:52.242 --> 01:24:55.012
I was one of Bianca's many men.

1272
01:24:57.715 --> 01:25:00.150
You remember me, don't you?

1273
01:25:02.486 --> 01:25:03.697
I thought the first time we met

1274
01:25:03.721 --> 01:25:04.621
was at the office that day.

1275
01:25:04.655 --> 01:25:06.056
So what do you mean, Bianca's?

1276
01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:08.058
What do you mean you saw me there?

1277
01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:12.463
She thought she'd just let
me go like I was nothing.


1278
01:25:17.401 --> 01:25:19.069
You know I was there that day.

1279
01:25:19.103 --> 01:25:21.638
I wanted to know who she
was seeing behind my back.


1280
01:25:24.675 --> 01:25:28.545
Then I saw you and everything changed.

1281
01:25:40.891 --> 01:25:44.128
I saw in your desperation

1282
01:25:44.161 --> 01:25:45.462
a need to be touched.

1283
01:25:47.731 --> 01:25:48.731
To be desired.

1284
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.502
You're Felix?

1285
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:54.405
He told me he was Charlie.

1286
01:25:55.839 --> 01:25:58.208
Didn't you learn your
lesson after the last one?


1287
01:25:58.242 --> 01:26:01.145
That guy, I can't remember
what he as called.


1288
01:26:01.178 --> 01:26:02.179
Charlie?

1289
01:26:02.212 --> 01:26:03.080
Yeah, Charlie.

1290
01:26:03.113 --> 01:26:04.882
Oh, he was hot
but got weird as fuck.

1291
01:26:04.915 --> 01:26:08.852
You know, he wouldn't stop
texting and calling me and stuff.


1292
01:26:08.886 --> 01:26:12.456
It was a one night stand
and you couldn't let it go!


1293
01:26:12.489 --> 01:26:15.526
Who the fuck are you anyway?

1294
01:26:16.593 --> 01:26:17.704
You don't wanna know who I am.

1295
01:26:17.728 --> 01:26:19.430
Get the fuck off of me!

1296
01:26:24.535 --> 01:26:26.303
You know they were there that day,

1297
01:26:27.604 --> 01:26:28.604
at the cafe.

1298
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:34.378
It happened twice.

1299
01:26:36.513 --> 01:26:40.417
I was over before it started.

1300
01:26:42.886 --> 01:26:43.886
Hello?

1301
01:26:44.955 --> 01:26:46.890
Hey, can you come around?

1302
01:26:46.924 --> 01:26:48.225
No, I can't right now.

1303
01:26:48.258 --> 01:26:49.159
You can't do this to me.

1304
01:26:49.193 --> 01:26:50.794
You think I'm a one night stand?

1305
01:26:52.196 --> 01:26:53.564
If you don't come right now, Rick,

1306
01:26:53.597 --> 01:26:56.233
I'm gonna tell Elise everything.

1307
01:26:56.266 --> 01:26:58.268
Okay, okay, yes, all right.

1308
01:26:58.302 --> 01:27:00.304
Okay, I'll come and
meet you now, okay, bye.


1309
01:27:14.685 --> 01:27:17.254
I wanted to be with you, Elise.

1310
01:27:20.691 --> 01:27:22.926
That's why I quit my job.

1311
01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.930
I wanted to make it up to
you and be there for you,


1312
01:27:26.964 --> 01:27:29.333
like I should've always been.

1313
01:27:29.366 --> 01:27:31.235
Shut the fuck up.

1314
01:27:32.803 --> 01:27:33.803
Liar.

1315
01:27:34.805 --> 01:27:36.240
Once a cheat, always a cheat.

1316
01:27:41.345 --> 01:27:42.546
Well now you know the truth.

1317
01:27:44.748 --> 01:27:48.352
You can see them
for what they truly are.

1318
01:27:48.385 --> 01:27:51.288
You see them

1319
01:27:51.321 --> 01:27:52.356
and you see me.

1320
01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:54.958
It's all black and white.

1321
01:27:57.661 --> 01:27:59.296
Felix, this isn't right.

1322
01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:01.465
Okay, you need to let them go.

1323
01:28:03.033 --> 01:28:04.201
Let them go?

1324
01:28:05.469 --> 01:28:06.670
After what they've done?

1325
01:28:10.741 --> 01:28:12.476
These two are the last attachment.

1326
01:28:13.644 --> 01:28:16.013
Once they're gone, it's just us.

1327
01:28:16.046 --> 01:28:17.924
What they did, what
they did, it wasn't right


1328
01:28:17.948 --> 01:28:18.992
but neither was what we did, okay?

1329
01:28:19.016 --> 01:28:22.352
So please, just put the
knife down and let them go.


1330
01:28:22.386 --> 01:28:23.754
Are you serious?

1331
01:28:24.988 --> 01:28:25.988
Huh?

1332
01:28:26.957 --> 01:28:27.957
Let them go?

1333
01:28:29.326 --> 01:28:31.295
It's all forgiven, just like that?

1334
01:28:32.396 --> 01:28:33.396
Huh?

1335
01:28:41.305 --> 01:28:42.272
No, no, no!

1336
01:28:42.306 --> 01:28:44.474
No, no, please, please!
You know what, Elise,


1337
01:28:44.508 --> 01:28:46.052
you've never been one to make decisions.

1338
01:28:46.076 --> 01:28:47.277
No.

1339
01:28:47.311 --> 01:28:48.312
I'll do the hard part.

1340
01:28:48.345 --> 01:28:49.346
No, no!

1341
01:28:49.379 --> 01:28:50.379
No!

1342
01:28:51.315 --> 01:28:52.349
No!

1343
01:28:53.817 --> 01:28:55.385
No!

1344
01:28:55.419 --> 01:28:56.820
No!

1345
01:28:56.853 --> 01:28:58.355
No, no,

1346
01:28:58.388 --> 01:28:59.423
Rick!

1347
01:29:00.424 --> 01:29:01.424
No, no!

1348
01:29:03.827 --> 01:29:04.827
No!

1349
01:29:06.063 --> 01:29:10.300
No!

1350
01:29:14.972 --> 01:29:15.972
Rick.

1351
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:28.485
You're gonna be okay.

1352
01:29:28.518 --> 01:29:32.689
You're gonna be all right,
I promise, I promise.


1353
01:29:35.459 --> 01:29:36.459
I'm sorry.

1354
01:29:43.734 --> 01:29:47.404
Elise, please, untie
me, please, untie me!


1355
01:29:48.905 --> 01:29:49.906
It's okay.

1356
01:29:58.015 --> 01:29:58.815
Go!

1357
01:29:58.849 --> 01:30:00.350
Go, go, go, go get help!

1358
01:30:00.384 --> 01:30:01.952
Please forgive me.

1359
01:30:01.985 --> 01:30:03.553
Please.

1360
01:30:03.587 --> 01:30:06.123
Just go, just go, okay?

1361
01:30:06.156 --> 01:30:07.391
Go, I said, go!

1362
01:30:07.424 --> 01:30:08.458
Go now!

1363
01:30:17.834 --> 01:30:19.002
Yes.

1364
01:30:19.036 --> 01:30:20.637
I need the police.

1365
01:30:20.671 --> 01:30:23.407
Yes, police, I need help, please.

1366
01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:24.440
He's got a knife.

1367
01:30:40.657 --> 01:30:43.627
No!

1368
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.002
I'm gonna come back for you, okay?

1369
01:30:52.035 --> 01:30:54.171
I'm gonna go and get help.

1370
01:30:54.204 --> 01:30:56.440
You're gonna be all right.

1371
01:30:56.473 --> 01:30:58.141
You're gonna be fine.

1372
01:30:58.175 --> 01:31:00.010
Hold on, hold on, okay?

1373
01:31:00.043 --> 01:31:01.043
Hold on.

1374
01:31:26.069 --> 01:31:27.069
B?

1375
01:31:27.938 --> 01:31:28.938
B?

1376
01:31:30.073 --> 01:31:31.508
B, come on.

1377
01:31:31.541 --> 01:31:32.109
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1378
01:31:32.142 --> 01:31:33.477
Come on, speak to me.

1379
01:31:34.544 --> 01:31:35.445
Come on.

1380
01:31:35.479 --> 01:31:36.713
Please, please, speak to me.

1381
01:31:36.747 --> 01:31:37.747
Come on.

1382
01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.589
B, you're gonna fine, okay?

1383
01:31:45.622 --> 01:31:46.990
I'm gonna go get help.

1384
01:31:47.023 --> 01:31:50.160
I'm gonna get help
and we're gonna be okay.

1385
01:31:52.529 --> 01:31:54.698
Don't, please don't.

1386
01:32:01.638 --> 01:32:02.638
I'm sorry.

1387
01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:22.625
Please.

1388
01:32:23.627 --> 01:32:25.929
I'm so sorry how I treated you.

1389
01:32:30.967 --> 01:32:32.469
I need you, Elise.

1390
01:32:34.905 --> 01:32:38.241
I don't have anyone or anything but you.

1391
01:32:40.677 --> 01:32:41.278
Do you understand?

1392
01:32:41.311 --> 01:32:42.279
I need to have you.

1393
01:32:42.312 --> 01:32:43.513
You're mine.

1394
01:32:46.817 --> 01:32:47.884
And I know...

1395
01:32:50.554 --> 01:32:52.589
why you rejected me before.

1396
01:32:54.691 --> 01:32:57.861
Why you said we couldn't
be together anymore.


1397
01:32:59.729 --> 01:33:03.099
Because you're married, isn't it?

1398
01:33:03.133 --> 01:33:06.770
You can't leave him because you're married.

1399
01:33:06.803 --> 01:33:09.039
Till death do you part, right?

1400
01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:15.545
We can be together now.

1401
01:33:18.949 --> 01:33:19.949
Forever.

1402
01:33:36.132 --> 01:33:37.132
Fuck you!

1403
01:33:42.973 --> 01:33:44.574
What did you say?

1404
01:33:45.675 --> 01:33:47.944
I said, fuck you.

1405
01:33:47.978 --> 01:33:49.646
Yeah, I heard you.

1406
01:33:51.815 --> 01:33:52.815
Go on.

1407
01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:55.218
Give your best shot.

1408
01:33:56.987 --> 01:33:58.688
Don't ever talk to me like that.

1409
01:33:58.722 --> 01:34:00.957
I said, fuck you!

1410
01:34:06.196 --> 01:34:08.031
You have no control.

1411
01:34:09.666 --> 01:34:10.667
But I do.

1412
01:34:22.145 --> 01:34:24.681
You know, you just
don't get it, do you?

1413
01:34:28.018 --> 01:34:30.186
You never had the control.

1414
01:34:33.924 --> 01:34:36.793
This whole time you felt empowered.

1415
01:34:36.826 --> 01:34:41.197
I swear, in time, I
promise you you'll have it.


1416
01:34:41.231 --> 01:34:43.967
I was your master and you obeyed.

1417
01:34:46.036 --> 01:34:47.037
Look at you.

1418
01:34:48.805 --> 01:34:51.341
Without me, you're nothing.

1419
01:35:05.255 --> 01:35:08.224
Without me, you're nothing.

1420
01:35:11.194 --> 01:35:12.696
No!

1421
01:35:12.729 --> 01:35:13.763
No!

1422
01:35:15.332 --> 01:35:16.933
Do you hear that?

1423
01:35:18.234 --> 01:35:20.337
Without me, you are shit!

1424
01:35:42.125 --> 01:35:44.294
You never had the power.

1425
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:47.764
I did!

1426
01:35:53.737 --> 01:35:55.005
I did love you.

1427
01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:58.675
But not anymore.

1428
01:36:01.344 --> 01:36:02.344
Go on.

1429
01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:04.714
Do it.

1430
01:36:08.451 --> 01:36:09.451
I

1431
01:36:10.353 --> 01:36:11.353
Made you.

1432
01:36:15.525 --> 01:36:16.793
Fantasy over.

1433
01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:15.251
And then moved on to
Bianca Mathews' house,


1434
01:37:15.285 --> 01:37:17.787
attacking and binding her,

1435
01:37:18.922 --> 01:37:20.824
before moving on to your place

1436
01:37:20.857 --> 01:37:23.827
to pick off his next target, Mr. Styles.

1437
01:37:25.895 --> 01:37:27.797
Felix...

1438
01:37:29.232 --> 01:37:33.036
Well, we should stop referring
to him as Felix now, really.


1439
01:37:33.069 --> 01:37:36.406
It's very unlikely his
name was actually Felix.


1440
01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:39.843
At the moment, he's a John Doe.

1441
01:37:41.411 --> 01:37:44.447
There's next to no
evidence he ever existed.


1442
01:37:44.481 --> 01:37:46.883
Can't you trace his family or friends?

1443
01:37:46.916 --> 01:37:49.819
Surely someone must know something.

1444
01:37:49.853 --> 01:37:52.489
We followed up every lead that we had.

1445
01:37:52.522 --> 01:37:53.890
Each one was a dead end.

1446
01:37:55.492 --> 01:37:57.927
So he really did have no one then.

1447
01:38:05.935 --> 01:38:08.872
Elise, I know it's a tough subject,

1448
01:38:08.905 --> 01:38:10.874
but I might as
well run it by you.

1449
01:38:13.143 --> 01:38:15.178
As we have no contacts of Felix,

1450
01:38:16.913 --> 01:38:19.082
there's no one to take his ashes.

1451
01:38:21.251 --> 01:38:22.852
We can dispose of them, obviously.

1452
01:38:22.886 --> 01:38:23.920
No, no.

1453
01:38:26.189 --> 01:38:27.991
It's fine, I can take them.

1454
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:34.531
Sorry to interrupt.

1455
01:38:34.564 --> 01:38:36.933
I just wanted to have another.

1456
01:38:36.966 --> 01:38:37.834
It's very good to see

1457
01:38:37.867 --> 01:38:39.445
you've made a full recovery, Mr. Styles.

1458
01:38:39.469 --> 01:38:41.429
Well, I couldn't have
done it without this one.


1459
01:38:43.973 --> 01:38:44.974
Or this one.

1460
01:38:47.177 --> 01:38:48.912
Do you know what you're having?

1461
01:38:48.945 --> 01:38:49.945
Boy.

1462
01:38:52.315 --> 01:38:54.484
Congratulations.

1463
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:57.013
This garden is so beautiful.

1464
01:40:00.216 --> 01:40:03.453
Well it will be, that is until

1465
01:40:03.486 --> 01:40:04.621
little man comes along.

1466
01:40:21.070 --> 01:40:22.138
Who's that?

1467
01:40:23.406 --> 01:40:28.411
No one.

1468
01:40:30.179 --> 01:40:32.582
Oh?

1469
01:40:32.615 --> 01:40:34.384
Oh, what me to get some water?

1470
01:40:34.417 --> 01:40:35.752
Yeah, please.

1471
01:40:35.785 --> 01:40:37.020
Okay.

1472
01:40:37.754 --> 01:40:39.289
Thank you.

1473
01:40:39.322 --> 01:40:41.024
Yeah.
