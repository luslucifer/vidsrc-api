ABOUT JOAN

2
00:02:09.123 --> 00:02:13.040
Directed by Laurent Larivière

3
00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:43.998
My name is Joan. Joan Verra.

4
00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:46.915
It sounds masculine in French,

5
00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:50.332
but it's common in Ireland,
my father's country.


6
00:02:51.373 --> 00:02:53.082
It's spelled J
-O
-A
-N.

7
00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:55.373
But I hate being called Joanne.

8
00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:56.957
It always happens.

9
00:02:57.623 --> 00:03:01.498
Some even pronounce it John,
like John Wayne! Absurd.


10
00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.582
It's Joan.

11
00:03:07.123 --> 00:03:09.248
I was born in the early 60s.

12
00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:12.540
My parents met in Saint
-Nazaire.

13
00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:15.665
My mother was a fairly free young woman,

14
00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:17.582
very much in love.

15
00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:20.957
My father left Ireland at 18

16
00:03:21.123 --> 00:03:23.207
to work in the shipyards.

17
00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:27.165
He met my mother
at the launch of the liner France,


18
00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:30.165
on May 11th, 1960.

19
00:03:30.415 --> 00:03:33.373
I believed there was proof
of that moment.


20
00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:35.123
But there wasn't.

21
00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:38.665
I was even sure I'd held the photo

22
00:03:38.832 --> 00:03:41.082
of them both next to the ship

23
00:03:41.248 --> 00:03:42.915
in the joyful crowd.

24
00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:44.707
It's absurd.

25
00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:47.415
That image was purely in my mind.

26
00:03:48.748 --> 00:03:52.040
I'd heard the story so often,
it had become real.


27
00:03:54.415 --> 00:03:56.873
That's also how memories are made.

28
00:09:20.373 --> 00:09:21.540
What do you want?

29
00:20:45.915 --> 00:20:46.915
That's good.

30
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.207
Two...

31
00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:51.457
Three...

32
00:20:51.873 --> 00:20:52.873
Four...

33
00:23:50.832 --> 00:23:52.498
We've been worried sick!

34
00:23:52.707 --> 00:23:53.998
Don't start.

35
00:23:54.582 --> 00:23:55.873
Come here, my baby.

36
00:24:42.207 --> 00:24:44.540
Nathan is the best thing in my life.

37
00:24:44.998 --> 00:24:47.498
All mothers say that,
but for me it's true.


38
00:24:47.915 --> 00:24:50.665
It isn't true that he saved my life

39
00:24:50.957 --> 00:24:52.873
or gave it meaning.

40
00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.790
I don't believe all that nonsense.

41
00:24:56.248 --> 00:24:58.082
We know life has no meaning,

42
00:24:58.582 --> 00:25:00.290
with offspring or without.

43
00:25:01.165 --> 00:25:02.748
Ma'am, your cigarette.

44
00:25:02.915 --> 00:25:04.790
Oh, yes, sorry.

45
00:25:26.832 --> 00:25:28.207
Take him, Dad.

46
00:27:23.873 --> 00:27:25.790
Tim Ardenne speaking.

47
00:27:26.415 --> 00:27:28.207
- It's me.
- Yes?


48
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.040
Who?

49
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.207
You must have the wrong number, madam.

50
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.915
Miss.

51
00:27:35.748 --> 00:27:39.123
I'm sorry, miss, 
I don't have time now.

52
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.915
My wife has vanished.

53
00:27:41.498 --> 00:27:44.415
I say my wife, but we're not married.

54
00:27:44.707 --> 00:27:46.832
I hate the idea of belonging.

55
00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:48.207
It's just quicker.

56
00:27:48.373 --> 00:27:50.915
Yes, I understand, of course.

57
00:27:51.457 --> 00:27:53.957
She left one night, like that.

58
00:27:54.123 --> 00:27:56.040
Almost without warning.

59
00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.290
She just told me, "Don't worry."

60
00:27:59.998 --> 00:28:04.082
Those words are ideal
to make someone worry, aren't they?


61
00:28:04.457 --> 00:28:06.665
It wasn't very wise of her.

62
00:28:09.707 --> 00:28:11.415
I'm sorry, my love.

63
00:28:11.582 --> 00:28:12.582
It's all right.

64
00:28:12.915 --> 00:28:15.540
I can come right away if you want.

65
00:28:15.707 --> 00:28:17.623
No, really, it's ok.

66
00:28:19.415 --> 00:28:21.373
It does me good being here.

67
00:28:30.373 --> 00:28:31.415
One more time.

68
00:28:47.248 --> 00:28:48.957
I need a volunteer.

69
00:28:59.248 --> 00:29:00.540
Your weakness, James?

70
00:29:02.123 --> 00:29:06.165
Off the top of my head, my generosity.
I'm too genuine.


71
00:29:06.457 --> 00:29:07.998
It often deceives me.

72
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.665
He means in this exercise

73
00:29:12.832 --> 00:29:13.998
in particular.

74
00:29:17.207 --> 00:29:18.540
Any ideas?

75
00:29:20.623 --> 00:29:22.123
He neglects his back.

76
00:29:23.623 --> 00:29:24.623
Exactly.

77
00:29:25.457 --> 00:29:28.123
I told him. It's the same at mah-jong.

78
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.373
From the beginning.

79
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.332
That man's not very nice.

80
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.373
Why do you say that?

81
00:29:46.123 --> 00:29:48.207
Grandpa's always on the floor.

82
00:29:51.748 --> 00:29:53.915
Grandpa agrees to it.

83
00:29:54.082 --> 00:29:55.248
One more time.

84
00:29:55.415 --> 00:29:57.998
Learn to fall, to pick yourself up.

85
00:29:58.248 --> 00:30:00.040
Talk about a life metaphor.

86
00:30:00.207 --> 00:30:02.582
When you fall,
you hurt yourself, period.


87
00:30:03.873 --> 00:30:05.707
They lie to us, Nathan.

88
00:30:22.457 --> 00:30:24.082
What's she up to?

89
00:30:47.832 --> 00:30:48.873
Nearly ready.

90
00:30:55.873 --> 00:30:57.207
What took so long?

91
00:30:57.873 --> 00:30:59.748
I couldn't find my bag, sorry.

92
00:30:59.915 --> 00:31:01.040
Let's go.

93
00:32:40.415 --> 00:32:42.123
I tried my best to resist.

94
00:32:43.373 --> 00:32:44.998
But it's uncontrollable.

95
00:32:48.832 --> 00:32:50.290
I feel as if

96
00:32:50.623 --> 00:32:51.832
I'm living again.

97
00:32:54.707 --> 00:32:56.623
Not that I felt dead before.

98
00:32:57.623 --> 00:32:59.123
Or sad or anything.

99
00:32:59.957 --> 00:33:01.665
I was already very happy.

100
00:33:02.665 --> 00:33:03.707
But now...

101
00:33:06.957 --> 00:33:08.207
It's much more.

102
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.623
Who knows where it'll lead,

103
00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:14.832
but I have to experience it.

104
00:33:15.373 --> 00:33:17.082
You can't even communicate.

105
00:33:18.082 --> 00:33:19.457
You're wrong.

106
00:33:23.957 --> 00:33:25.707
We communicate perfectly.

107
00:33:26.082 --> 00:33:29.165
Our bodies do the talking.
They speak the truth.


108
00:33:29.332 --> 00:33:31.790
That's a load of crap, Mum.

109
00:33:32.915 --> 00:33:33.915
And Dad?

110
00:33:34.665 --> 00:33:37.748
I love James. I'll always love him.

111
00:33:38.582 --> 00:33:40.040
That's not the issue.

112
00:33:40.832 --> 00:33:42.915
Actually, I think it is.

113
00:33:43.998 --> 00:33:45.290
You must tell him.

114
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.790
No.

115
00:33:47.748 --> 00:33:51.707
You have to tell him.
I refuse to keep it to myself.


116
00:33:51.873 --> 00:33:53.248
You really want that?

117
00:33:53.582 --> 00:33:54.665
I want nothing.

118
00:33:55.915 --> 00:33:57.748
Face your responsibilities.

119
00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:03.832
You have to go now, darling.

120
00:34:26.582 --> 00:34:30.748
I cannot postpone anything,

121
00:34:31.748 --> 00:34:34.623
even if the night weighs like centuries

122
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:37.873
on my shoulders,

123
00:34:38.707 --> 00:34:43.873
even if hesitant dawn is late in coming,

124
00:34:44.748 --> 00:34:46.582
I cannot put off my life

125
00:34:46.748 --> 00:34:49.457
to another century,

126
00:34:50.373 --> 00:34:51.873
nor my love,

127
00:34:52.165 --> 00:34:53.998
nor my cry of release.

128
00:34:54.498 --> 00:34:59.248
No, I cannot postpone the heart.

129
00:35:18.957 --> 00:35:20.373
What's going on?

130
00:35:21.373 --> 00:35:23.623
I didn't want it to be like this.

131
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.040
I wanted to drop this off

132
00:35:29.248 --> 00:35:30.540
before coming back.

133
00:35:37.332 --> 00:35:38.582
I'm leaving, James.

134
00:35:38.957 --> 00:35:41.748
To go where? What is this?

135
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.582
I'm leaving, that's it.

136
00:35:46.873 --> 00:35:47.957
That's it?

137
00:35:48.623 --> 00:35:49.873
That's all?

138
00:35:54.332 --> 00:35:56.415
I'm moving to Japan with Kazuo.

139
00:35:56.998 --> 00:35:57.998
Kazuo?

140
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:01.457
To Japan?

141
00:36:06.123 --> 00:36:07.540
You know I love you.

142
00:36:07.998 --> 00:36:09.207
Yes, I know.

143
00:36:09.748 --> 00:36:10.915
I love you too.

144
00:36:13.165 --> 00:36:14.832
I've nothing against you.

145
00:36:15.665 --> 00:36:16.915
Almost nothing.

146
00:36:20.748 --> 00:36:22.832
I've seen the solicitor.

147
00:36:22.998 --> 00:36:26.040
You get my father's firm.
You'll lack nothing.


148
00:36:29.957 --> 00:36:32.832
I renounce my status
as a mother and wife.


149
00:36:33.915 --> 00:36:36.457
It's too hasty.
You don't know what to expect.


150
00:36:37.207 --> 00:36:39.248
I can't miss out on my life.

151
00:36:46.748 --> 00:36:48.207
You're lucky.

152
00:37:28.332 --> 00:37:29.165
Hello?

153
00:37:29.332 --> 00:37:30.707
Hello, it's me.

154
00:37:30.873 --> 00:37:31.998
Nathan?

155
00:37:32.165 --> 00:37:34.040
It's night there,
aren't you asleep?


156
00:37:34.207 --> 00:37:37.082
No, I'm not. I'm in France.

157
00:37:37.248 --> 00:37:38.415
In Paris?

158
00:37:38.582 --> 00:37:42.123
No, I'm not in Paris.
I took a train to the station in...


159
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.582
What's that little station

160
00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:48.623
Why didn't you tell me?

161
00:37:49.707 --> 00:37:50.748
Surprise.

162
00:37:50.915 --> 00:37:52.415
I have to pick you up?

163
00:37:52.582 --> 00:37:55.373
I don't want to bother you,
you're busy...


164
00:37:55.582 --> 00:37:57.373
I can go back to Montreal.

165
00:37:57.582 --> 00:38:00.457
Don't be so touchy.
I'm on my way.


166
00:38:00.623 --> 00:38:01.957
No, I'm kidding.

167
00:38:02.165 --> 00:38:05.165
I hitched.
I'm at Mariposa, at the gate.


168
00:38:26.748 --> 00:38:28.123
My son!

169
00:38:28.457 --> 00:38:29.457
Joan.

170
00:38:30.123 --> 00:38:31.582
You can call me Mum.

171
00:38:31.748 --> 00:38:33.290
You used to hate that.

172
00:38:33.457 --> 00:38:35.790
I was too young
to be a mother then.

173
00:38:35.957 --> 00:38:38.082
I need to get back to basics.

174
00:38:38.248 --> 00:38:39.957
Honoured to be part of that.

175
00:38:44.415 --> 00:38:46.123
- What?
- You're very elegant.


176
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.873
- Stop.
- You've changed. Your walk...


177
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.915
You're more self-confident.

178
00:38:51.498 --> 00:38:52.665
It's the snow.

179
00:38:52.832 --> 00:38:55.623
It's down to snowshoes,
not confidence.


180
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.790
How can you stand the snow?

181
00:38:57.998 --> 00:39:00.998
It hit -27° C in Montreal last winter.

182
00:39:01.165 --> 00:39:02.748
I don't think I could.

183
00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:05.290
You must come to see us one day.

184
00:39:06.332 --> 00:39:07.790
Why are you here?

185
00:39:10.082 --> 00:39:11.832
Did Tim ask you to come?

186
00:39:11.998 --> 00:39:13.290
You know he didn't.

187
00:39:16.123 --> 00:39:18.248
Is the small bedroom ok?

188
00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.707
Your childhood room, I mean.

189
00:39:20.873 --> 00:39:22.457
There's a big bed now.

190
00:39:22.665 --> 00:39:23.873
Anything suits me.

191
00:39:24.457 --> 00:39:26.123
It'll bring back memories.

192
00:39:32.998 --> 00:39:34.040
It's locked.

193
00:39:34.207 --> 00:39:37.415
The handle turns the other way around,
remember.


194
00:39:43.707 --> 00:39:44.957
Drat...

195
00:39:46.082 --> 00:39:48.415
Silly me, the key's in the vase.

196
00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.207
I don't know where it is.

197
00:39:58.123 --> 00:39:59.748
Never mind. Who cares?

198
00:39:59.915 --> 00:40:03.123
The guest room suits me fine, ok.

199
00:40:33.707 --> 00:40:36.290
That unsettled me a lot as a kid.

200
00:40:36.457 --> 00:40:38.248
True, it is a bit raunchy.

201
00:40:53.998 --> 00:40:56.290
I'd forgotten how beautiful it is.

202
00:40:56.957 --> 00:40:59.415
I feel I haven't been here in ages.

203
00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:01.290
I can confirm that.

204
00:41:02.332 --> 00:41:04.457
Sorry I missed your retirement party.

205
00:41:04.623 --> 00:41:07.790
It's better this way.
I'd rather see you alone.


206
00:41:08.415 --> 00:41:10.082
Me too. It's been ages?

207
00:41:10.415 --> 00:41:11.457
Yes.

208
00:41:12.207 --> 00:41:13.373
I hesitated.

209
00:41:13.915 --> 00:41:16.290
Should I come or not?

210
00:41:16.748 --> 00:41:18.415
It's good you're here.

211
00:41:19.832 --> 00:41:21.415
It was a horrible party.

212
00:41:21.873 --> 00:41:23.040
I hated it.

213
00:41:23.665 --> 00:41:26.248
Solemn farewells, forced compliments...

214
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:27.957
What a drag.

215
00:41:28.498 --> 00:41:31.332
All I miss are the manuscripts.

216
00:41:31.832 --> 00:41:34.415
They send me a few now and then.

217
00:41:34.957 --> 00:41:36.665
There's good stuff this year.

218
00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:41.332
I forgot,
you only read scientific texts.


219
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:42.790
No.

220
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.540
On the plane, I read a book of Tim's
I had lying around.


221
00:41:46.873 --> 00:41:49.248
Tim Ardenne's books don't lie around.

222
00:41:49.415 --> 00:41:50.415
Which one?

223
00:41:50.748 --> 00:41:54.165
A book about trains
and wrong directions...


224
00:41:54.582 --> 00:41:56.165
Steel and Sweat.

225
00:41:56.332 --> 00:41:58.207
- Did you like it?
- Yes.


226
00:41:58.582 --> 00:42:02.748
I really liked his description
of the female character.


227
00:42:04.748 --> 00:42:05.748
Is it you?

228
00:42:06.873 --> 00:42:08.498
He claims it is.

229
00:42:08.665 --> 00:42:10.582
But you know him.

230
00:42:12.373 --> 00:42:13.873
Has he always loved you?

231
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.582
Yes.

232
00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.998
"As he walked,

233
00:42:18.165 --> 00:42:21.290
"her bright face
was continually before him.


234
00:42:21.707 --> 00:42:24.665
"It was madness to think of such purity.

235
00:42:24.957 --> 00:42:26.748
"He had known vice and kindness,

236
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.582
"but never purity."

237
00:42:29.373 --> 00:42:31.957
Purity... That's me to a T.

238
00:43:12.165 --> 00:43:13.165
Careful!

239
00:43:36.998 --> 00:43:38.415
"Die...

240
00:43:38.707 --> 00:43:40.665
"That's what you have to do.

241
00:43:41.832 --> 00:43:43.748
"That is the only way

242
00:43:43.915 --> 00:43:46.915
"to truly gain access to life.

243
00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.582
"One does not live

244
00:43:49.998 --> 00:43:52.998
"if one is not prepared to die.

245
00:43:53.957 --> 00:43:56.165
"Missing your own death

246
00:43:56.498 --> 00:43:59.332
"would be worse than anything else."

247
00:44:02.832 --> 00:44:04.123
Mr Ardenne?

248
00:44:07.415 --> 00:44:08.415
Tim?

249
00:44:10.123 --> 00:44:11.123
Yes?

250
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.498
Dying as the only way

251
00:44:13.665 --> 00:44:15.915
to truly gain access to life.

252
00:44:17.165 --> 00:44:19.498
That's quite contradictory.

253
00:44:19.665 --> 00:44:20.665
Yes.

254
00:44:24.457 --> 00:44:25.915
You think so?

255
00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:28.832
I guess it is.

256
00:44:38.165 --> 00:44:40.290
If it requires explanation...

257
00:44:47.915 --> 00:44:49.623
It's all in here.

258
00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.582
The last part of
the book is very funny.

259
00:44:57.207 --> 00:44:58.873
The surprising thing

260
00:44:59.748 --> 00:45:04.082
is that people in France
laugh as much as they do in Germany.


261
00:45:04.373 --> 00:45:06.873
Could you define comedy for us?

262
00:45:07.457 --> 00:45:08.998
Absolutely not.

263
00:45:10.998 --> 00:45:13.707
But you agree the ending is funny?

264
00:45:19.707 --> 00:45:21.998
I can't stop people from laughing.

265
00:45:23.415 --> 00:45:25.790
What makes a good book for you?

266
00:45:26.207 --> 00:45:27.415
Alcohol.

267
00:45:28.457 --> 00:45:31.373
Is your success based
on a misunderstanding?


268
00:45:33.248 --> 00:45:36.790
I don't think we're loved or hated
for the right reasons.


269
00:45:39.707 --> 00:45:40.707
Ever.

270
00:45:49.373 --> 00:45:51.373
You first write in French,

271
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.040
then again in German.

272
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:56.248
Isn't that a little strange?

273
00:45:58.332 --> 00:46:00.540
I'd rather end the interview.

274
00:46:01.998 --> 00:46:03.832
I'm suffering too much.

275
00:46:04.998 --> 00:46:06.415
Why are you suffering?

276
00:46:11.873 --> 00:46:13.873
I'm in love, you understand?

277
00:46:14.332 --> 00:46:16.207
That's wonderful!

278
00:46:18.623 --> 00:46:20.207
I love Joan Verra.

279
00:46:23.582 --> 00:46:25.332
Your French publisher?

280
00:46:26.623 --> 00:46:28.123
She discovered me.

281
00:46:28.582 --> 00:46:29.832
Fantastic.

282
00:46:30.623 --> 00:46:32.040
She doesn't love me.

283
00:46:33.082 --> 00:46:35.290
I'm sure she likes you.

284
00:46:36.373 --> 00:46:40.373
The title, The Misery of Beautiful Days,
where is it from?


285
00:46:41.957 --> 00:46:43.790
She doesn't love me.

286
00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:46.832
She likes me.

287
00:46:47.707 --> 00:46:49.290
She often says so.

288
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.165
That's something, I suppose.

289
00:46:55.123 --> 00:46:57.623
She can even say,
"I like you a lot."

290
00:47:00.082 --> 00:47:01.998
And that's really...

291
00:47:03.957 --> 00:47:06.165
That's really unbearable.

292
00:47:11.165 --> 00:47:12.207
Let's stop.

293
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:14.248
It's for the best.

294
00:47:14.415 --> 00:47:16.165
I'll see you again soon.

295
00:47:17.665 --> 00:47:19.457
Off line, thank you.

296
00:47:29.373 --> 00:47:30.623
Why are you here?

297
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:32.207
I had some free time.

298
00:47:32.623 --> 00:47:35.165
Rubbish, you can't skip school.

299
00:47:35.707 --> 00:47:37.498
Go back to Paris. I'm busy.

300
00:47:37.665 --> 00:47:40.582
He takes up all my energy.
I'm working.


301
00:47:41.123 --> 00:47:43.290
It's ok, I know you're working.

302
00:47:43.457 --> 00:47:46.248
I'm not a child. 
I can manage on my own.

303
00:47:46.457 --> 00:47:47.623
How was I?

304
00:47:48.207 --> 00:47:49.498
Devastating.

305
00:47:50.373 --> 00:47:53.123
I could've shed real tears, you know.

306
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:55.623
It would've been no use.

307
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:58.207
You have no emotions.

308
00:47:58.373 --> 00:48:01.290
I have emotions,
but different from yours.


309
00:48:03.373 --> 00:48:04.790
Forgive me.

310
00:48:20.248 --> 00:48:23.123
- What paid for your ticket?
- Your jewels.


311
00:48:23.457 --> 00:48:24.540
Stupid.

312
00:48:27.582 --> 00:48:29.498
What's wrong now?

313
00:48:29.998 --> 00:48:31.540
I won't sign this crap.

314
00:48:31.832 --> 00:48:33.290
It's your first novel.

315
00:48:33.457 --> 00:48:34.957
It was a rough draft.

316
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.082
The book is important for me.

317
00:48:39.248 --> 00:48:42.082
It changed my life. Literally.

318
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.248
It's a masterpiece.

319
00:48:44.415 --> 00:48:45.415
A masterpiece?

320
00:48:45.582 --> 00:48:46.790
Nathan, please.

321
00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:49.915
I felt brought back to life,
thanks to this book.


322
00:48:50.082 --> 00:48:52.248
I rediscovered my vitality.

323
00:48:52.665 --> 00:48:56.915
Through the life of a garbageman
crushed to death by his truck?


324
00:48:57.332 --> 00:48:58.582
She seems moved.

325
00:49:00.415 --> 00:49:01.915
Good for her.

326
00:49:02.373 --> 00:49:03.957
And I have no emotions?

327
00:49:05.165 --> 00:49:07.082
You're all pissing me off!

328
00:49:15.873 --> 00:49:18.665
I can sign it if you like.

329
00:49:19.082 --> 00:49:21.832
I can imitate his signature perfectly.

330
00:49:32.665 --> 00:49:33.832
Are you ok?

331
00:49:37.623 --> 00:49:38.623
It's here.

332
00:49:39.457 --> 00:49:41.373
I feel it seeping in.

333
00:49:42.498 --> 00:49:45.123
It's harder and harder.

334
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:47.415
Each time, it's harder.

335
00:49:47.707 --> 00:49:48.540
What is?

336
00:49:48.707 --> 00:49:49.832
Dying.

337
00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.082
Haven't you ever died?

338
00:49:52.623 --> 00:49:53.665
Never.

339
00:49:54.582 --> 00:49:56.748
I knew it. You can't understand.

340
00:49:56.915 --> 00:49:58.165
Give me your hand.

341
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.123
Things end.

342
00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:05.123
That's how it is. They end.
You must accept it.


343
00:50:05.832 --> 00:50:08.290
You have to be strong.
Promise me?


344
00:50:08.457 --> 00:50:09.832
I promise.

345
00:50:11.165 --> 00:50:12.707
Beyond the grave,

346
00:50:12.998 --> 00:50:14.582
I'll still love you.

347
00:50:19.207 --> 00:50:20.623
He's a handful.

348
00:50:21.248 --> 00:50:22.915
It'd be no fun if he wasn't.

349
00:50:23.082 --> 00:50:24.290
Can you stand him?

350
00:50:24.457 --> 00:50:27.123
I actually find him touching in a way.

351
00:50:34.373 --> 00:50:36.915
You're like the moon and I'm the sun.

352
00:50:37.248 --> 00:50:38.290
Touching?

353
00:50:39.748 --> 00:50:41.207
He has his qualities.

354
00:50:44.915 --> 00:50:45.957
Come on!

355
00:50:53.457 --> 00:50:54.457
Move it!

356
00:50:56.957 --> 00:50:59.040
Don't you want to call a taxi?

357
00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:02.165
No use, we're only five minutes away.

358
00:51:02.665 --> 00:51:05.332
I'm in pain and I'm tired.

359
00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:10.540
Joan!

360
00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:24.790
Joan...

361
00:51:26.332 --> 00:51:28.082
I owe you an apology.

362
00:51:28.248 --> 00:51:29.373
That's true.

363
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.790
For my behaviour, not for my love.

364
00:51:31.957 --> 00:51:33.498
- Tim...
- Let me speak.


365
00:51:34.998 --> 00:51:38.123
It won't take long
and I'll only say it once.


366
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:40.582
I won't repeat this.
After,


367
00:51:40.873 --> 00:51:42.498
I'll leave you in peace.

368
00:51:49.623 --> 00:51:51.832
Living without you is unbearable.

369
00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.707
Yet I try to break away from you.
I really try.


370
00:51:56.457 --> 00:51:57.582
But I can't.

371
00:51:59.332 --> 00:52:02.623
I've always tried
to be independent of women,


372
00:52:03.082 --> 00:52:05.415
to limit their power over me.

373
00:52:06.207 --> 00:52:08.457
I felt in control of my feelings.

374
00:52:09.832 --> 00:52:10.915
But then...

375
00:52:12.457 --> 00:52:16.582
you arrived in my life
and I realized nothing I had lived...


376
00:52:18.873 --> 00:52:19.873
nothing...

377
00:52:20.457 --> 00:52:22.623
had any real value.

378
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:28.457
All that mattered
was being by your side.


379
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.373
Or not too far away.

380
00:52:30.665 --> 00:52:32.498
Like these last few years.

381
00:52:35.457 --> 00:52:38.123
I also know that I'm unbearable.

382
00:52:38.623 --> 00:52:41.498
I understand
that you feel like slapping me.


383
00:52:44.748 --> 00:52:45.832
Go ahead.

384
00:53:41.957 --> 00:53:44.248
What are you doing in Cologne?

385
00:53:44.832 --> 00:53:46.957
Three days apart was too much?

386
00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:48.498
I can't believe that.

387
00:53:54.457 --> 00:53:55.873
You searched my office?

388
00:53:58.123 --> 00:53:59.582
You read my notebooks?

389
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:02.665
Of course you did.

390
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.207
I never would have.

391
00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.623
Did you enjoy it?

392
00:54:06.957 --> 00:54:08.582
Yes, I enjoyed it.

393
00:54:09.748 --> 00:54:11.123
Did you learn anything?

394
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:12.290
You bet.

395
00:54:12.623 --> 00:54:13.748
Such as what?

396
00:54:14.332 --> 00:54:15.582
About you and Doug.

397
00:54:16.498 --> 00:54:17.665
You won't say Dad?

398
00:54:17.915 --> 00:54:19.248
Why would I?

399
00:54:20.165 --> 00:54:22.123
I don't know what you learned.

400
00:54:22.832 --> 00:54:25.873
I never lied to you. I told you...

401
00:54:26.915 --> 00:54:27.707
everything.

402
00:54:27.873 --> 00:54:28.873
In general.

403
00:54:28.998 --> 00:54:30.665
Now I know the details.

404
00:54:30.915 --> 00:54:32.707
The magic of a first love.

405
00:54:32.998 --> 00:54:34.665
Irony doesn't suit you.

406
00:54:35.207 --> 00:54:36.373
You're hurt.

407
00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.498
There's stuff on me
I don't like.


408
00:54:41.332 --> 00:54:42.665
I'm listening.

409
00:54:51.957 --> 00:54:53.207
"Friday, July 10th.

410
00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:57.207
"I fear Nathan may turn superficial,
focused on his appearance."


411
00:54:57.373 --> 00:54:58.373
Nice.

412
00:54:59.165 --> 00:55:01.457
"Each hair he counts on his chest

413
00:55:01.623 --> 00:55:03.165
"is a personal victory."

414
00:55:03.332 --> 00:55:05.665
I never did that. 
It's humiliating.

415
00:55:06.165 --> 00:55:07.457
So don't read it.

416
00:55:07.623 --> 00:55:09.707
This is less well written, I feel.

417
00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:11.165
You're the expert.

418
00:55:11.415 --> 00:55:12.665
Don't be mean.

419
00:55:13.207 --> 00:55:14.332
I'm not.

420
00:55:17.248 --> 00:55:19.040
- Please...
- Hold on.


421
00:55:19.957 --> 00:55:20.665
Enough.

422
00:55:20.832 --> 00:55:24.248
If you came about your puberty,
I don't have time.


423
00:55:24.415 --> 00:55:26.665
I came cos you fell asleep one day.

424
00:55:26.832 --> 00:55:28.998
One summer. In August.

425
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:31.582
Where is it?

426
00:57:31.165 --> 00:57:32.290
You fell asleep.

427
00:57:32.832 --> 00:57:33.873
Why?

428
00:57:34.748 --> 00:57:36.040
Out of carelessness?

429
00:57:37.123 --> 00:57:38.915
I forbid you to say that.

430
00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:42.207
You forbid me?

431
00:58:23.457 --> 00:58:24.873
Can I have a drag?

432
00:58:25.665 --> 00:58:27.290
- You smoke?
- No.


433
00:58:44.207 --> 00:58:45.790
How long did it last?

434
00:58:45.998 --> 00:58:47.082
I don't know.

435
00:58:48.082 --> 00:58:51.373
How long was I unconscious?
Ten minutes? Fifteen?


436
00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.873
I've no idea.

437
00:58:53.457 --> 00:58:55.540
I remember it seemed endless.

438
00:58:56.207 --> 00:58:58.373
Without the fire brigade...

439
00:58:59.998 --> 00:59:01.832
You weren't going to tell me?

440
00:59:03.998 --> 00:59:05.040
No.

441
00:59:05.832 --> 00:59:08.540
You're well, in shape.
Nothing else matters.


442
00:59:10.665 --> 00:59:13.915
You can't even remember it.
What are you after?


443
00:59:15.373 --> 00:59:17.457
You need reassuring, is that it?

444
00:59:18.123 --> 00:59:19.123
Yes.

445
00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:23.957
Doubt my love and I'll kill you.

446
00:59:32.207 --> 00:59:34.832
Same again, please. Vodka tonic.

447
00:59:40.373 --> 00:59:42.373
It burns? That's good.

448
00:59:42.832 --> 00:59:44.623
It explodes in your head.

449
00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:45.873
Perfect.

450
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.790
You've drunk before, right?

451
00:59:50.623 --> 00:59:51.957
It's the first time?

452
00:59:53.665 --> 00:59:55.582
You've always been a bit behind.

453
00:59:59.873 --> 01:00:04.082
Nathan, you're a young man now.
You'll be a real man soon.


454
01:00:04.248 --> 01:00:05.873
I won't talk sex with you.

455
01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040
No.

456
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:08.457
Listen to me.

457
01:00:08.832 --> 01:00:11.373
Your schooling in the next five years

458
01:00:11.707 --> 01:00:13.665
will determine your future.

459
01:00:14.207 --> 01:00:16.915
Do your learning now while you can.

460
01:00:17.082 --> 01:00:18.832
In five years, it'll be too late.

461
01:00:19.748 --> 01:00:22.790
Knowing you,
you'll realize and find it unbearable.


462
01:00:23.207 --> 01:00:25.832
I won't be able to help, obviously.

463
01:00:25.998 --> 01:00:27.123
Obviously.

464
01:00:30.707 --> 01:00:32.998
You'll have to face problems alone.

465
01:00:33.707 --> 01:00:36.957
I'll be there if you need me,
but that won't help.


466
01:00:40.082 --> 01:00:42.123
We have to face things alone.

467
01:00:48.082 --> 01:00:50.165
But you know that, right?

468
01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040
No.

469
01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:09.665
Come on.

470
01:01:15.707 --> 01:01:18.123
Others' looks shouldn't matter.

471
01:01:19.332 --> 01:01:20.957
It's about your life.

472
01:01:29.082 --> 01:01:30.248
Stop it.

473
01:03:10.915 --> 01:03:12.040
Nathan?

474
01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.165
Nathan, are you awake?

475
01:03:17.415 --> 01:03:20.248
If you have a long nap now,
you'll be a mess.


476
01:03:20.415 --> 01:03:22.207
You won't sleep tonight.

477
01:03:24.832 --> 01:03:25.998
Nathan?

478
01:03:27.165 --> 01:03:28.332
Can you hear me?

479
01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:04.790
Yes?

480
01:05:08.332 --> 01:05:09.540
We had an appointment?

481
01:05:09.957 --> 01:05:11.998
Do I need one to see my mother?

482
01:05:12.165 --> 01:05:15.248
Of course not.
Sorry. My head's stuffed with work!


483
01:05:15.498 --> 01:05:16.915
I'll come back later.

484
01:05:18.165 --> 01:05:19.832
Champagne? Why?

485
01:05:21.207 --> 01:05:23.248
I forgot your birthday again?

486
01:05:23.415 --> 01:05:24.415
No.

487
01:05:24.582 --> 01:05:25.832
I had an interview.

488
01:05:25.998 --> 01:05:27.540
For a lab?
You never said.


489
01:05:28.165 --> 01:05:29.623
I wanted to be sure.

490
01:05:29.957 --> 01:05:32.457
So guess who they chose.

491
01:05:34.415 --> 01:05:35.457
Your son.

492
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:37.873
Wonderful! I'm proud of you.

493
01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.748
Now I'll have access to real resources,

494
01:05:40.915 --> 01:05:42.665
unlike what I have now,

495
01:05:42.873 --> 01:05:45.082
and with a totally free rein.

496
01:05:46.123 --> 01:05:48.082
And I'll be heading a team.

497
01:05:48.248 --> 01:05:49.582
My dream come true.

498
01:05:49.748 --> 01:05:52.790
I have to admit,
it's scary to think about,


499
01:05:52.957 --> 01:05:54.332
so I try not to.

500
01:05:55.498 --> 01:05:56.998
You'll do brilliantly.

501
01:05:57.165 --> 01:05:59.373
It's a real dream. The building

502
01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.415
is modern, centralized.

503
01:06:01.582 --> 01:06:03.498
It's state-of-the-art over there.

504
01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:07.290
Over there?

505
01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:10.998
It's in Montreal.

506
01:06:26.665 --> 01:06:27.665
Joan?

507
01:06:28.457 --> 01:06:30.082
If you're happy...

508
01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:33.457
It's good.

509
01:06:37.207 --> 01:06:38.582
I need a cigarette.

510
01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:40.165
You have one.

511
01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:43.082
I need another.

512
01:06:45.207 --> 01:06:47.040
You don't seem pleased.

513
01:06:49.665 --> 01:06:51.915
I am. I'm very happy for you.

514
01:06:52.207 --> 01:06:53.665
But seeing you leave...

515
01:06:55.207 --> 01:06:57.207
Children leave their parents.

516
01:06:58.123 --> 01:06:59.498
Sooner or later.

517
01:07:00.957 --> 01:07:02.832
I'm 30, after all.

518
01:07:04.165 --> 01:07:05.165
So?

519
01:07:11.748 --> 01:07:13.832
Forgive me. I'm being stupid.

520
01:07:16.707 --> 01:07:18.207
I'll come back often.

521
01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:21.623
You can visit too.
You don't know Quebec.


522
01:07:22.332 --> 01:07:23.665
It's really nice.

523
01:07:27.415 --> 01:07:28.665
Want that champagne?

524
01:07:29.873 --> 01:07:31.415
I'll get the glasses.

525
01:07:52.623 --> 01:07:53.665
Where were you?

526
01:07:53.832 --> 01:07:55.748
An errand in the village.

527
01:07:55.915 --> 01:07:57.623
- On foot?
- Yes.


528
01:07:57.915 --> 01:07:59.290
Whatever for?

529
01:07:59.457 --> 01:08:00.998
"Did you rest, dear?"

530
01:08:01.873 --> 01:08:03.248
"Yes, thank you."

531
01:08:03.498 --> 01:08:06.165
"Your jet lag from the flight
to see your mum?"


532
01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:07.873
"I'll get over it soon."

533
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.498
"Will it be sunny?"

534
01:08:09.665 --> 01:08:11.457
I hate when you do that!

535
01:08:11.665 --> 01:08:13.332
I was worried sick.

536
01:08:13.498 --> 01:08:14.915
Why, exactly?

537
01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.707
I'm a big boy now.

538
01:08:17.998 --> 01:08:19.498
Why leave me alone?

539
01:08:19.665 --> 01:08:21.623
I couldn't sleep,

540
01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:24.207
you weren't around
and I needed a walk.


541
01:08:24.373 --> 01:08:25.623
I was here.

542
01:08:25.957 --> 01:08:28.082
You can't vanish like that.

543
01:08:29.123 --> 01:08:30.332
I didn't vanish.

544
01:08:30.665 --> 01:08:32.290
Mum, calm down.

545
01:08:32.457 --> 01:08:34.290
No, I don't want to!

546
01:08:41.873 --> 01:08:44.082
Find something to do, I'll tidy up.

547
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.748
If you came to mess me about,

548
01:08:49.998 --> 01:08:52.040
pack up and go back to Montreal.

549
01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:54.290
Drop it.

550
01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.248
Still like doughnut peaches?

551
01:08:58.415 --> 01:08:59.415
Yes.

552
01:08:59.748 --> 01:09:02.082
I got some for you.
Was it a good idea?


553
01:09:02.707 --> 01:09:04.040
I wonder.

554
01:10:02.582 --> 01:10:04.790
"He had finally met her.

555
01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040
"The woman,

556
01:10:06.457 --> 01:10:09.457
"the one he had waited for
without realizing it,


557
01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:11.457
"the one destined for him.

558
01:10:11.832 --> 01:10:13.582
"He had looked into her soul

559
01:10:13.748 --> 01:10:17.165
"and had grasped
her rare special something,


560
01:10:17.748 --> 01:10:20.498
"as beautiful as the eyes reflecting it,

561
01:10:20.748 --> 01:10:23.457
"as beautiful as the flesh embodying it.

562
01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.332
"Not one word, not one sign,

563
01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:30.582
"not one word of advice from the Divine
had guided him.


564
01:10:30.832 --> 01:10:32.915
"He didn't believe in the Divine.

565
01:10:33.373 --> 01:10:35.457
"There was no beyond.

566
01:10:35.623 --> 01:10:37.457
"He was sure of it.

567
01:10:37.915 --> 01:10:39.582
"Life had to be lived,

568
01:10:39.998 --> 01:10:43.623
"here and now,
before sinking into the void."


569
01:10:45.748 --> 01:10:46.998
It's magnificent.

570
01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.790
You can't deny it.

571
01:10:48.957 --> 01:10:50.790
It's great, easy to read.

572
01:10:51.957 --> 01:10:53.165
Very pleasant.

573
01:10:56.290 --> 01:10:57.415
Pleasant?

574
01:10:57.998 --> 01:11:00.540
- Is that an insult?
- Not at all.


575
01:11:00.832 --> 01:11:03.123
You certainly don't disappoint us.

576
01:11:03.832 --> 01:11:06.623
Really,
it's exactly what we expect of you.


577
01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:08.915
You must be very pleased.

578
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.290
You insult me so naturally.

579
01:11:13.457 --> 01:11:15.915
I was bored stiff!
It's the same recipe.


580
01:11:16.082 --> 01:11:18.040
I've read it ten times before.

581
01:11:18.248 --> 01:11:20.248
I may be wrong, but this line...

582
01:11:23.665 --> 01:11:25.707
"There was no beyond.
He was sure of it.


583
01:11:25.873 --> 01:11:28.513
"Life had to be lived, here and now,
before sinking into the void."


584
01:11:28.623 --> 01:11:30.707
Wasn't that in your last novel?

585
01:11:30.873 --> 01:11:32.540
And the one before too?

586
01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:37.040
I assert a right to repetition.

587
01:11:37.207 --> 01:11:40.707
People will end up realizing
I've only written one book


588
01:11:40.873 --> 01:11:43.123
that took on different forms.

589
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:45.790
All great artists dig a furrow.

590
01:11:45.957 --> 01:11:47.373
More like a tunnel.

591
01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.415
The train driver
blending with his engine,


592
01:11:50.582 --> 01:11:51.998
you call that new?

593
01:11:52.165 --> 01:11:54.832
He doesn't die,
crushed by the machine.


594
01:11:56.748 --> 01:11:57.832
I guess...

595
01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:01.748
Show me your breasts?

596
01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:03.623
No.

597
01:12:03.998 --> 01:12:04.998
You hesitated.

598
01:12:05.457 --> 01:12:08.415
Of course, you turn me on
and that annoys me.


599
01:12:09.082 --> 01:12:10.582
But I know your game.

600
01:12:10.748 --> 01:12:12.498
Sex as a diversionary tactic

601
01:12:12.832 --> 01:12:13.873
is pathetic.

602
01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:18.040
The first part,
the kid watching trains,


603
01:12:18.207 --> 01:12:18.957
who cares?

604
01:12:19.123 --> 01:12:20.748
We want to be on the tracks.

605
01:12:20.915 --> 01:12:22.415
We want movement!

606
01:12:27.957 --> 01:12:30.457
And the affair with his boss' wife...

607
01:12:30.623 --> 01:12:32.332
Talk about tasteless!

608
01:12:36.665 --> 01:12:38.290
It compromises the ending.

609
01:12:41.415 --> 01:12:42.623
We need a rewrite.

610
01:12:47.332 --> 01:12:48.332
Hello?

611
01:12:51.457 --> 01:12:53.915
It's the Saint
-Nazaire housing office.

612
01:12:54.082 --> 01:12:58.790
I'm calling about overdue rent
on apartment B14 at Ambroise Paré.


613
01:12:59.998 --> 01:13:03.332
There must be some mistake.
I don't understand.


614
01:13:03.498 --> 01:13:06.165
You are Madeleine Verra's daughter?

615
01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:08.332
It must be a homonym.

616
01:13:08.498 --> 01:13:11.540
My mother moved to Japan
over twenty years ago.


617
01:13:11.707 --> 01:13:14.248
She was Madeleine Joséphine Verra,

618
01:13:14.707 --> 01:13:17.165
née Saulet on October 14, 1942,

619
01:13:17.332 --> 01:13:18.540
in Saint
-Nazaire

620
01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.707
who died last week?

621
01:13:26.248 --> 01:13:27.248
Hello?

622
01:13:29.082 --> 01:13:30.248
Yes...

623
01:13:31.748 --> 01:13:36.082
You need to clear the apartment.
There's a waiting list. Sorry.


624
01:13:37.457 --> 01:13:39.332
Yes, all right.

625
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.915
We get a lot of deaths here.

626
01:13:48.748 --> 01:13:50.623
But hers really wasn't fair.

627
01:13:51.832 --> 01:13:54.373
People liked her.
She helped out a lot.


628
01:13:54.998 --> 01:13:56.832
They'd leave her their kids.

629
01:13:57.123 --> 01:13:59.457
She'd babysit for a bit of money.

630
01:13:59.623 --> 01:14:00.873
She needed it.

631
01:14:02.415 --> 01:14:05.290
I never saw anyone so good with kids.

632
01:14:05.623 --> 01:14:06.998
What a joke...

633
01:14:10.498 --> 01:14:14.123
We invited her once for Christmas.
Something simple.


634
01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:15.290
She refused.

635
01:14:15.373 --> 01:14:17.832
That wasn't nice.
We did it for her sake.


636
01:14:17.998 --> 01:14:19.915
You accept an invitation.

637
01:14:20.082 --> 01:14:22.248
We'll bring them back later.

638
01:14:22.707 --> 01:14:24.290
It's the last door.

639
01:16:18.332 --> 01:16:19.498
I'm here.

640
01:16:52.123 --> 01:16:54.373
What the hell was she doing here?

641
01:16:54.915 --> 01:16:56.582
What is this shit?

642
01:16:56.998 --> 01:16:58.457
When did she come back?

643
01:16:58.957 --> 01:17:01.040
These are her rent receipts.

644
01:17:02.457 --> 01:17:06.290
The oldest one is from November 1989.

645
01:17:06.998 --> 01:17:08.915
That's over fifteen years ago.

646
01:17:10.123 --> 01:17:12.790
How come she never told us?

647
01:17:15.707 --> 01:17:17.790
What did we do to deserve this?

648
01:17:17.957 --> 01:17:20.540
It's sick. I was alone with Nathan.

649
01:17:21.748 --> 01:17:23.165
It's really sick.

650
01:17:23.582 --> 01:17:24.790
Don't say that.

651
01:17:26.957 --> 01:17:28.623
Who knows what happened.

652
01:17:29.998 --> 01:17:31.915
Nothing, apparently.

653
01:17:41.665 --> 01:17:43.748
She'd planned her own funeral.

654
01:17:43.915 --> 01:17:45.082
A long time ago.

655
01:17:45.832 --> 01:17:47.748
On arriving back here.

656
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:52.748
She even deprived us of her death.

657
01:17:53.457 --> 01:17:55.207
Her ashes were scattered

658
01:17:55.373 --> 01:17:56.915
in the local cemetery.

659
01:17:59.915 --> 01:18:01.998
There's a sealed envelope.

660
01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:25.832
Excuse me,
the garden of remembrance, please?


661
01:18:25.998 --> 01:18:29.332
Over there.
The memorial area is being remodelled.


662
01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.332
Thank you.

663
01:18:33.248 --> 01:18:34.665
Memorial area...

664
01:19:02.457 --> 01:19:04.498
"Joan, my darling little girl,

665
01:19:04.665 --> 01:19:07.082
"Don't seek an explanation
in these words.


666
01:19:07.248 --> 01:19:08.790
"Life is elusive.

667
01:19:08.957 --> 01:19:11.582
"I have no answers. 
I regret nothing.

668
01:19:11.873 --> 01:19:14.748
"Leaving for Japan
was a wonderful adventure.


669
01:19:14.957 --> 01:19:17.207
"You've no idea how...

670
01:19:18.707 --> 01:19:19.707
"how...

671
01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:21.498
"happy I was there.

672
01:19:21.665 --> 01:19:24.873
"I found my place and culture.
It's so beautiful.


673
01:19:25.123 --> 01:19:27.707
"Cherry blossom season is magical.

674
01:19:27.873 --> 01:19:30.998
"Kazuo and I opened
a small bonsai tree shop.


675
01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:35.165
"I became a specialist,
almost a celebrity.


676
01:19:35.332 --> 01:19:37.498
"Just think, a European

677
01:19:37.665 --> 01:19:40.457
"outdoing the Japanese
in their ancient art.


678
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:43.082
"They'd cross the country to see me.

679
01:19:43.457 --> 01:19:45.582
"But Kazuo piled up gambling debts.

680
01:19:45.748 --> 01:19:47.665
"He owed money to Yakuza.

681
01:19:47.873 --> 01:19:50.957
"As he couldn't pay,
he became their henchman.


682
01:19:51.123 --> 01:19:52.707
"But he kept gambling.

683
01:19:52.957 --> 01:19:55.832
"I found all that out
when we had to flee.


684
01:19:55.998 --> 01:19:58.415
"We moved to South Korea.

685
01:19:58.582 --> 01:20:01.082
"We lived humbly, but we were in love.

686
01:20:01.248 --> 01:20:02.457
"That was the main thing."

687
01:20:02.623 --> 01:20:04.248
Even in death, she lies.

688
01:20:05.707 --> 01:20:08.707
"I'm lying, of course.
I lie in writing this.


689
01:20:08.873 --> 01:20:11.582
"Should I say that I made a mistake,

690
01:20:11.748 --> 01:20:14.540
"that Kazuo was always a total asshole,

691
01:20:14.707 --> 01:20:17.373
"and that I lived in solitude and shame?

692
01:20:17.623 --> 01:20:20.290
"Frankly, which version do you prefer?

693
01:20:23.290 --> 01:20:25.623
"I never stopped thinking of you all,

694
01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:29.123
"refusing to admit my weakness
and my failure.


695
01:20:29.290 --> 01:20:31.415
"Make your life magical,

696
01:20:33.582 --> 01:20:35.207
"my darling little girl.

697
01:20:36.082 --> 01:20:37.998
"I've been happy, you know.

698
01:20:40.915 --> 01:20:44.040
"Remember that. 
I loved living."

699
01:21:13.498 --> 01:21:15.165
"I would like the dead

700
01:21:15.415 --> 01:21:16.707
"to stay dead.

701
01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:20.373
"Why should they rule over me?

702
01:21:21.165 --> 01:21:23.082
"Beauty is alive

703
01:21:23.582 --> 01:21:25.082
"and it is eternal."

704
01:21:31.373 --> 01:21:34.915
"Beauty is alive and it is eternal."

705
01:21:37.457 --> 01:21:38.665
You believe that?

706
01:21:39.748 --> 01:21:40.748
No.

707
01:21:42.457 --> 01:21:43.498
All the same...

708
01:21:47.415 --> 01:21:48.998
What do we drink to?

709
01:21:50.707 --> 01:21:53.248
We drink to my mother, I suppose.

710
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:56.082
And to Japan.

711
01:21:57.790 --> 01:22:01.373
We should have brought sake
to drink on her grave.


712
01:22:01.915 --> 01:22:03.748
That would have had style.

713
01:22:17.248 --> 01:22:18.832
We did a new experiment.

714
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.582
We managed to erase a memory
in a brain.


715
01:22:22.957 --> 01:22:23.957
No!

716
01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.623
A mouse's brain.

717
01:22:26.998 --> 01:22:28.207
Can mice swim?

718
01:22:28.373 --> 01:22:29.623
Yes, very well.

719
01:22:30.332 --> 01:22:31.790
But that's not the issue.

720
01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.623
We put a plastic platform in the pool,

721
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:36.790
the same colour as the liquid.

722
01:22:37.957 --> 01:22:39.082
Very hard to see.

723
01:22:39.248 --> 01:22:42.165
The mouse has to find
it to rest on it.

724
01:22:42.748 --> 01:22:44.248
It's the only solution.

725
01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.707
It takes time, but she finds it.

726
01:22:47.165 --> 01:22:49.123
- Poor thing.
- What?


727
01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:50.873
You hate mice.

728
01:22:52.165 --> 01:22:53.165
The next day,

729
01:22:53.207 --> 01:22:55.623
we do it again
with the same mouse


730
01:22:56.207 --> 01:22:57.707
who remembers everything.

731
01:22:57.873 --> 01:23:00.457
She swims straight to the platform

732
01:23:00.623 --> 01:23:01.623
without hesitation.

733
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:03.248
She knows where it is.

734
01:23:03.582 --> 01:23:04.748
She has learned.

735
01:23:04.915 --> 01:23:06.123
Fascinating.

736
01:23:06.415 --> 01:23:08.707
Day three, we start again.

737
01:23:09.123 --> 01:23:12.498
But we inject a substance
that blocks the memory.


738
01:23:12.998 --> 01:23:15.332
I knew torture would be involved.

739
01:23:15.915 --> 01:23:18.373
She totally forgot her memories.

740
01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:21.540
It's as if she has lost her memory.

741
01:23:21.873 --> 01:23:23.457
She swims and swims.

742
01:23:23.998 --> 01:23:25.082
She swims.

743
01:23:26.165 --> 01:23:27.207
She swims...

744
01:23:30.123 --> 01:23:31.290
She swims...

745
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:31.832
Mum...

746
01:24:37.707 --> 01:24:38.707
Mum?

747
01:26:23.123 --> 01:26:24.290
It's over.

748
01:26:33.915 --> 01:26:35.623
You shouldn't have died.

749
01:26:42.123 --> 01:26:43.707
No one dies aged six.

750
01:26:46.373 --> 01:26:47.415
Sorry.

751
01:26:50.582 --> 01:26:51.623
Sorry.

752
01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:53.957
It's not your fault.

753
01:26:55.582 --> 01:26:56.998
Of course it is.

754
01:26:58.123 --> 01:26:59.207
No.

755
01:27:01.373 --> 01:27:02.832
You were so young.

756
01:27:11.998 --> 01:27:13.373
You're so handsome.

757
01:27:23.457 --> 01:27:24.623
My little mum...

758
01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:33.623
It'll be ok.

759
01:27:35.957 --> 01:27:37.040
It'll be ok.

760
01:27:52.207 --> 01:27:54.415
After you died, it all fell apart.

761
01:27:55.082 --> 01:27:56.373
I was lost.

762
01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.498
What should I do?

763
01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.248
I was waiting for who knows what.

764
01:28:03.582 --> 01:28:06.790
Then one day, at a street corner,
you appeared.


765
01:28:06.998 --> 01:28:08.790
As if nothing had happened.

766
01:28:09.123 --> 01:28:11.040
The way you do so well.

767
01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:14.290
It was obvious. A secret.

768
01:28:14.582 --> 01:28:15.582
Our secret.

769
01:28:15.748 --> 01:28:16.957
Exactly.

770
01:28:17.123 --> 01:28:19.498
The grief faded and I accepted it.

771
01:28:19.998 --> 01:28:21.415
You did well to summon me.

772
01:28:21.582 --> 01:28:22.998
As if I had a choice.

773
01:28:23.165 --> 01:28:25.790
True, at first,
it scared me a little.


774
01:28:26.832 --> 01:28:28.790
Everything scares you a little.

775
01:28:28.957 --> 01:28:29.998
Not true!

776
01:28:30.165 --> 01:28:31.373
You hypocrite.

777
01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.415
I'm a hypocrite?

778
01:28:33.748 --> 01:28:35.207
Coming from you?

779
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:39.040
Did you see him again?

780
01:28:39.207 --> 01:28:41.082
- Who?
- You know who.


781
01:28:42.248 --> 01:28:43.332
Your father?

782
01:28:44.165 --> 01:28:46.623
Yes, in Paris, on the street, by chance.

783
01:28:46.873 --> 01:28:48.040
What's he like?

784
01:28:49.165 --> 01:28:51.040
He has aged. He has changed.

785
01:28:51.707 --> 01:28:52.998
Like me, I suppose.

786
01:28:53.165 --> 01:28:54.165
No.

787
01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.165
You're sweet.

788
01:28:58.915 --> 01:29:00.290
You didn't tell him?

789
01:29:02.082 --> 01:29:04.915
That you had been born
and that you died? No.


790
01:29:05.498 --> 01:29:07.040
There was no need.

791
01:29:07.373 --> 01:29:08.582
It was cruel.

792
01:29:10.915 --> 01:29:12.123
I've no idea.

793
01:29:12.748 --> 01:29:14.165
Maybe I should have.

794
01:29:15.165 --> 01:29:16.290
I don't know.

795
01:29:20.415 --> 01:29:21.957
It's a beautiful house.

796
01:29:23.373 --> 01:29:24.748
It was.

797
01:29:50.123 --> 01:29:52.790
What are you doing alone in the dark?

798
01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.540
Nothing.

799
01:29:59.248 --> 01:30:00.665
Did you fight again?

800
01:30:00.832 --> 01:30:01.832
Yes.

801
01:30:02.207 --> 01:30:03.665
Over a girl again?

802
01:30:05.207 --> 01:30:06.248
Why then?

803
01:30:06.623 --> 01:30:08.207
She has soft skin.

804
01:30:08.748 --> 01:30:10.082
That's no reason.

805
01:30:10.915 --> 01:30:13.040
How do you know her skin's soft?

806
01:30:13.873 --> 01:30:17.748
I hold her hand and the skin
under her wrist is soft.


807
01:30:17.957 --> 01:30:20.165
Where do you get your aggressiveness?

808
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:22.123
Not from me anyhow.

809
01:30:22.957 --> 01:30:24.248
My father, maybe?

810
01:30:24.415 --> 01:30:25.415
No.

811
01:30:26.373 --> 01:30:28.748
No, Doug wasn't like that.

812
01:30:30.707 --> 01:30:34.040
I think you have to know
how to defend yourself in life.


813
01:30:37.748 --> 01:30:39.748
I must tell you something, my love.

814
01:30:40.248 --> 01:30:41.290
What?

815
01:30:43.082 --> 01:30:45.748
Your presence has helped
all these years.


816
01:30:45.915 --> 01:30:47.915
I know. I noticed.

817
01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:51.123
But I need you to leave now.

818
01:30:53.498 --> 01:30:54.957
I can manage differently.

819
01:30:55.123 --> 01:30:56.332
I can tell.

820
01:31:00.332 --> 01:31:02.082
You want me to go?

821
01:31:08.332 --> 01:31:09.498
Are you sad?

822
01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.040
No.

823
01:31:18.957 --> 01:31:21.290
I can tell you are. 
I'm your mother.

824
01:31:25.748 --> 01:31:27.332
Is it over then?

825
01:31:29.748 --> 01:31:30.748
Yes.

826
01:33:31.082 --> 01:33:32.123
You came.

827
01:33:33.457 --> 01:33:34.832
You're stubborn.

828
01:33:36.248 --> 01:33:38.040
I sensed I had to.

829
01:33:49.665 --> 01:33:50.665
Are you ok?

830
01:33:52.207 --> 01:33:53.373
I'll be fine.

831
01:34:16.498 --> 01:34:17.957
The stairs creak a bit?

832
01:34:18.123 --> 01:34:20.290
Part of the charm of an old house.

833
01:34:20.457 --> 01:34:23.540
Old stones, creaking stairs,
banging shutters.


834
01:34:23.707 --> 01:34:26.207
- Why bother otherwise?
- I love it.


835
01:34:26.373 --> 01:34:27.540
Me too.

836
01:34:30.373 --> 01:34:34.332
This room faces south-west
and is sunny all day.


837
01:34:34.832 --> 01:34:36.582
The view is wonderful.

838
01:34:39.332 --> 01:34:41.748
There's direct access to the kitchen.

839
01:34:42.457 --> 01:34:46.832
Maybe we could demolish this
to open the kitchen to the dining room.


840
01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.207
Good idea.

841
01:34:48.373 --> 01:34:49.832
Isn't it a bearing wall?

842
01:34:49.998 --> 01:34:54.123
Behind the cupboards, yes,
but you can put in an IPN beam.


843
01:34:54.415 --> 01:34:56.290
But this one can go.

844
01:35:01.498 --> 01:35:02.623
And the roof?

845
01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:05.998
It's great.

846
01:35:06.332 --> 01:35:07.623
In good condition?

847
01:35:08.332 --> 01:35:09.832
Never a problem.

848
01:35:11.415 --> 01:35:13.165
I'll let you talk it over.

849
01:35:13.332 --> 01:35:15.332
Feel free to go back upstairs.

850
01:35:15.665 --> 01:35:18.165
Any questions, 
I'll be in the garden.

851
01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:20.332
- See you shortly.
- Thank you.


852
01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:59.040
Is there a manual in German?

853
01:35:59.207 --> 01:36:02.290
No, my dear friend, only in French.

854
01:36:03.832 --> 01:36:06.165
You told them I was your gardener?

855
01:36:06.498 --> 01:36:09.665
Yes, I suggested
making you part of the deal.


856
01:36:09.832 --> 01:36:11.498
Not gifted, but cheap.

857
01:36:12.957 --> 01:36:14.248
I'm flattered.

858
01:36:15.165 --> 01:36:16.540
Are they interested?

859
01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.457
Hard to say. The husband's fussy.

860
01:36:19.623 --> 01:36:23.332
I said I had someone
coming back tomorrow with an offer.


861
01:36:23.665 --> 01:36:24.790
That's not true.

862
01:36:24.957 --> 01:36:26.915
Yes, but it got them thinking.

863
01:36:28.248 --> 01:36:32.582
Why mow a lawn
since the grass always grows back?


864
01:36:33.207 --> 01:36:35.207
It's the cycle of life, right?

865
01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:36.915
So that's it.

866
01:36:37.290 --> 01:36:38.290
Life.

867
01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:40.373
How much longer?

868
01:36:42.873 --> 01:36:44.665
I love you, Mr Tim Ardenne.

869
01:36:45.665 --> 01:36:47.332
You saved my life, sir.

870
01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:53.165
It was an honour to meet you.

871
01:36:53.332 --> 01:36:56.415
No, we said we'd never say such things.

872
01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:58.707
I might cry.

873
01:37:00.123 --> 01:37:01.540
My bad.

874
01:37:05.998 --> 01:37:09.123
As a child, I hated daylight.
It terrified me.


875
01:37:09.332 --> 01:37:10.915
Now, I find it reassuring.

876
01:37:11.457 --> 01:37:13.873
We should move closer to the poles.

877
01:37:14.623 --> 01:37:16.748
Go where the sun never sets?

878
01:37:17.373 --> 01:37:18.165
Good idea.

879
01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:19.498
Greenland.

880
01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.582
We'd live in an igloo.

881
01:37:23.123 --> 01:37:26.582
We'd cut holes in the ice to fish.

882
01:37:27.207 --> 01:37:28.540
You hate the cold,

883
01:37:28.707 --> 01:37:31.998
but I'll buy you thick sweaters
and scarves.


884
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:34.498
Woollen ones.

885
01:37:35.415 --> 01:37:36.915
And a woolly hat too.

886
01:37:37.832 --> 01:37:39.123
It would suit you.

887
01:41:10.915 --> 01:41:13.540
