1
00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:23.978
May the Goddess bless you

2
00:03:24.228 --> 00:03:26.145
with a shining destiny,
my son!


3
00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:30.228
Hello, Cyrus!

4
00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:32.311
Hilla...

5
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.645
Remember, I told you

6
00:03:34.145 --> 00:03:36.853
about those thefts
at Perin Aunty's


7
00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:39.228
and the other neighbours' homes?

8
00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:41.533
The cops nabbed the thief.

9
00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:45.436
Must we discuss this
in front of Cyrus?


10
00:03:46.436 --> 00:03:47.811
The thief's name
is also Cyrus.


11
00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:49.978
Oh!

12
00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:53.353
Then we must think of
a new name for Cyrus!


13
00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:24.811
Attention!

14
00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:26.728
Guard...

15
00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:28.520
Attention!

16
00:04:31.853 --> 00:04:33.395
Guard!

17
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:35.895
General Salute!

18
00:04:36.478 --> 00:04:38.436
Present Arms!

19
00:04:52.478 --> 00:04:54.478
Guard!

20
00:04:54.978 --> 00:04:56.311
Ground Arms!

21
00:05:26.103 --> 00:05:27.145
What is your name?

22
00:05:27.353 --> 00:05:28.770
Rifleman Harka Gurung, Sir!

23
00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:30.228
Harka Gurung!

24
00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:32.020
What is my name?

25
00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:34.145
Sam...

26
00:05:34.478 --> 00:05:35.311
Mac...

27
00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:38.436
Monk...

28
00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:40.270
Sam Bahadur, Sir!

29
00:05:48.103 --> 00:05:49.520
Sam Bahadur.

30
00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:03.895
We'll be punished, Sam!

31
00:06:06.686 --> 00:06:07.895
Haji's right, Sam.

32
00:06:08.353 --> 00:06:09.311
Let's head back.

33
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.436
What happened?

34
00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:16.020
Nothing, just checking

35
00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:17.645
if you're still alive.

36
00:06:17.978 --> 00:06:19.603
What nonsense!
Of course, I'm alive!


37
00:06:21.353 --> 00:06:22.561
Then prove it!

38
00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:38.561
Well?

39
00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:39.686
Well?

40
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.686
Sam, we came here at 7,

41
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.186
it's 9.30 now.

42
00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:49.311
This is how time works,
sweetheart!


43
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.770
In some time,
it will be 10:30.


44
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:53.520
Then 11:30, and so on!

45
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.478
Sam, please.
Let's go!


46
00:06:57.061 --> 00:06:58.103
What happened?

47
00:06:58.395 --> 00:06:59.520
Am I boring you?

48
00:06:59.728 --> 00:07:01.561
Of course not, sweetheart!

49
00:07:02.978 --> 00:07:04.770
Meet my friends...

50
00:07:05.728 --> 00:07:08.145
That is Maharaj Kumarjeet Singh...

51
00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.104
And this is Haji Iftikar,

52
00:07:11.228 --> 00:07:13.228
of the famous Iftikar family.

53
00:07:13.395 --> 00:07:15.186
Maharaj, Nawab...

54
00:07:15.353 --> 00:07:17.270
Do you think your friends
can be my friends, too?


55
00:07:17.686 --> 00:07:19.520
And why not!

56
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:21.603
However...

57
00:07:22.436 --> 00:07:24.353
These modern day princes

58
00:07:24.478 --> 00:07:25.686
are pretty faint-hearted!

59
00:07:27.103 --> 00:07:28.561
They're scared of everything:

60
00:07:28.686 --> 00:07:30.936
the Company Commander,
the Adjutant,


61
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:32.186
the Quarter Master,

62
00:07:32.353 --> 00:07:35.020
and of their punishment!

63
00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:37.020
Who knows, you might
scare them, too!


64
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:38.936
Really?

65
00:07:39.853 --> 00:07:41.145
You're in the Army?

66
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:42.978
Yes, ma'am...

67
00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:45.770
Corporal Sam Manekshaw
at your service.


68
00:07:46.228 --> 00:07:48.186
I'm a Gentleman Cadet, but...

69
00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:51.311
I can't promise
I'll remain a gentleman!


70
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.228
Okay, Sam...

71
00:07:55.436 --> 00:07:56.811
You stay back...

72
00:07:57.228 --> 00:07:59.103
The last bus leaves
in 15 minutes...


73
00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:01.436
Haji and I are leaving.

74
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:03.270
Gentlemen!

75
00:08:04.853 --> 00:08:07.270
What's the first rule
of the Army?


76
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.978
"No man left behind."

77
00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:16.311
Well, where were we?

78
00:08:53.645 --> 00:08:54.811
We're dead!

79
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.145
For his absence from parade

80
00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:08.061
and indiscipline,

81
00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:10.186
by order of Major Cowan,

82
00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:11.686
Corporal Sam Manekshaw

83
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.228
is awarded punishment.

84
00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:14.978
Congratulations!

85
00:09:16.645 --> 00:09:18.270
You have earned the
distinction of becoming


86
00:09:18.353 --> 00:09:20.186
the first Gentleman Cadet

87
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:21.811
to be awarded a punishment

88
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.520
at the Indian Military Academy.

89
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:25.061
Don't!

90
00:09:25.353 --> 00:09:26.186
Not.

91
00:09:26.478 --> 00:09:27.353
One.

92
00:09:27.478 --> 00:09:28.520
Word!

93
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:30.770
And you two...

94
00:09:30.895 --> 00:09:33.061
It's not their fault, Sir.
I forced them and -


95
00:09:33.186 --> 00:09:34.186
I said,

96
00:09:34.395 --> 00:09:36.936
not one word!

97
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.978
The two of you,

98
00:09:40.103 --> 00:09:41.395
along with Manekshaw

99
00:09:41.478 --> 00:09:42.811
will be confined to barracks

100
00:09:42.895 --> 00:09:45.270
with restrictions for 15 days.

101
00:09:45.686 --> 00:09:46.686
One more instance,

102
00:09:46.811 --> 00:09:48.270
and you are going home.

103
00:09:49.061 --> 00:09:50.145
Am I clear?

104
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:51.145
Yes, Sir!

105
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.311
Manekshaw?

106
00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:54.270
Yes, Sir!

107
00:09:57.103 --> 00:09:59.770
That's two words, Sir.

108
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.603
Satisfied now? Huh?

109
00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:14.520
That night was itself satisfying!

110
00:10:15.436 --> 00:10:17.395
Enjoy your 15 day holiday, Sam...

111
00:10:17.686 --> 00:10:18.395
In three weeks,

112
00:10:18.478 --> 00:10:20.311
'The Butcher' will slaughter
your happiness!


113
00:10:20.645 --> 00:10:22.686
Tikka Khan is coming!

114
00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:30.020
Break!

115
00:10:30.478 --> 00:10:31.145
Break!

116
00:10:38.645 --> 00:10:39.311
Box!

117
00:10:43.353 --> 00:10:44.145
Break!

118
00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:45.645
Box!

119
00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:55.311
Continue?

120
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.186
Break!

121
00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:26.770
One...

122
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.936
Two...

123
00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:29.145
Three...

124
00:11:29.353 --> 00:11:30.311
Four...

125
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.520
Five...

126
00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:32.853
Six...

127
00:11:33.145 --> 00:11:34.145
Seven...

128
00:11:34.436 --> 00:11:35.478
Eight...

129
00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:36.561
Nine...

130
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:37.603
Ten!

131
00:11:46.978 --> 00:11:48.186
Well fought, Khan!

132
00:11:48.603 --> 00:11:49.561
Next time,

133
00:11:49.978 --> 00:11:51.520
victory will be mine...

134
00:11:52.436 --> 00:11:53.728
And then I'll offer you

135
00:11:54.103 --> 00:11:55.270
the same consolation.

136
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:56.686
We'll see!

137
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.895
2nd Lieutenant Sam Hormusji Framji
Jamshedji Manekshaw...


138
00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:10.478
Sign here.

139
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:13.353
Your next posting

140
00:12:13.478 --> 00:12:14.478
is with the 4th Battalion

141
00:12:14.603 --> 00:12:16.520
of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment

142
00:12:16.853 --> 00:12:18.186
stationed in Ferozepur.

143
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:20.311
Congratulations.

144
00:12:20.853 --> 00:12:22.145
You are a Piffer now.

145
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.436
I am also a Piffer!

146
00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:28.436
Look how pretty I am,

147
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.061
with my gorgeous light eyes

148
00:12:30.186 --> 00:12:31.436
and fair skin!

149
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.353
Have you ever seen
such a pretty Piffer?


150
00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:37.311
Hush, Dilsher...

151
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:39.228
He's the Platoon Commander.

152
00:12:39.603 --> 00:12:40.145
Oh?

153
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:43.645
Congratulations then!

154
00:12:44.436 --> 00:12:46.686
We have a girl as our
Platoon Commander!


155
00:13:41.645 --> 00:13:42.603
Dilsher!

156
00:13:43.311 --> 00:13:45.103
Even a girl can make this jump,

157
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.728
and a burly athlete
like you can't?


158
00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:05.770
Lieutenant Manekshaw...

159
00:14:06.728 --> 00:14:07.686
I...

160
00:14:09.228 --> 00:14:09.811
Actually I...

161
00:14:10.103 --> 00:14:11.186
...want to apologize?

162
00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:13.436
Sorry, Lieutenant.

163
00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:21.228
Sam.

164
00:14:22.186 --> 00:14:22.978
Please, Sam!

165
00:14:23.103 --> 00:14:25.936
I don't know anyone
at that party, Dilsher.


166
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.895
It's your friend's party,
you go.


167
00:14:28.103 --> 00:14:29.561
You haven't really lived

168
00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:31.353
until you've checked out
Lahore's party scene.


169
00:14:31.478 --> 00:14:33.145
I thought of going alone,

170
00:14:33.603 --> 00:14:34.520
but then I realised -

171
00:14:34.603 --> 00:14:36.228
there'll be so many
pretty women there!


172
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.853
And who better than you

173
00:14:37.978 --> 00:14:39.228
to teach me how
to charm them!


174
00:14:39.353 --> 00:14:40.103
Really?

175
00:14:40.353 --> 00:14:43.103
And I'm some expert
on charming women?


176
00:14:43.478 --> 00:14:44.895
Drop the act, Sam!

177
00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:47.895
The entire unit has heard
of your exploits.


178
00:14:48.228 --> 00:14:50.103
Let's see you
in action tonight!


179
00:14:52.153 --> 00:14:53.569
And I was staring...

180
00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:55.186
not at the CO's wife,

181
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.811
but at the cake!

182
00:14:57.311 --> 00:14:58.561
The CO's wife talked about

183
00:14:58.686 --> 00:15:00.103
everything in the world...

184
00:15:00.228 --> 00:15:02.228
but she never offered
us that bloody cake!


185
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:25.311
Who... is she?

186
00:15:29.103 --> 00:15:30.145
Silloo Bode.

187
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.478
Colonel Bharucha's sister-in-law.

188
00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:49.020
Excuse me.

189
00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:10.145
Sam. Sam Manekshaw.

190
00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:11.520
4th Battalion

191
00:16:11.645 --> 00:16:13.186
12th Frontier Force Regiment.

192
00:16:14.853 --> 00:16:15.686
Hello.

193
00:16:16.603 --> 00:16:17.561
I'm Silloo.

194
00:16:23.478 --> 00:16:24.853
I'm sorry.

195
00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:32.770
Usually, I have a lot to say...

196
00:16:33.145 --> 00:16:34.645
Clever, funny things...

197
00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:35.728
Compliments...

198
00:16:37.728 --> 00:16:38.770
But...

199
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.561
right now...

200
00:16:42.395 --> 00:16:43.186
Thank God!

201
00:16:44.353 --> 00:16:45.520
Because at every party,

202
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.311
every single guy says

203
00:16:48.103 --> 00:16:49.853
the same boring things...

204
00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:51.603
in an attempt to flirt.

205
00:16:56.145 --> 00:16:56.978
I promise you,

206
00:16:57.103 --> 00:16:58.520
I'll tell you something

207
00:16:58.645 --> 00:17:00.478
that you haven't heard before.

208
00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.186
That seems hard to believe.

209
00:17:04.603 --> 00:17:06.728
But go on, try...

210
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.228
I'm going to marry you.

211
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.353
I...

212
00:17:18.353 --> 00:17:19.645
Whatever it is...

213
00:17:22.935 --> 00:17:24.395
Say it after this dance.

214
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.770
"This little thing...!"

215
00:17:29.478 --> 00:17:32.978
"This little thing left unsaid"

216
00:17:33.895 --> 00:17:37.311
"is a now confession made."

217
00:17:38.145 --> 00:17:41.478
"This little thing, oh look"

218
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.603
"is now a fable made."

219
00:17:47.311 --> 00:17:49.145
"Not a cloud nor rain"

220
00:17:49.478 --> 00:17:51.311
"on that magical clear night..."

221
00:17:51.645 --> 00:17:53.561
"Hearts didn't connive"

222
00:17:53.853 --> 00:17:55.770
"nor cross the minds..."

223
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.270
"But a spell was cast"

224
00:17:58.686 --> 00:18:01.228
"in the silver moonlight."

225
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.353
"This little thing, oh look"

226
00:18:08.478 --> 00:18:11.270
"is now a fable made."

227
00:18:12.645 --> 00:18:14.061
"This little thing...!"

228
00:18:33.311 --> 00:18:36.645
"The ground firmly beneath us"

229
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.645
"The skies far and away"

230
00:18:46.311 --> 00:18:49.603
"The ground firmly beneath us"

231
00:18:50.478 --> 00:18:53.270
"The skies far and away"

232
00:18:55.103 --> 00:18:58.145
"But floating up two inches"

233
00:18:59.353 --> 00:19:02.936
"doesn't happen every day"

234
00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:07.061
"As hearts take flight"

235
00:19:07.895 --> 00:19:10.520
"making earth and sky sway."

236
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.770
"This little thing, oh look"

237
00:19:17.686 --> 00:19:21.020
"is now a fable made."

238
00:19:21.895 --> 00:19:23.520
"This little thing...!"

239
00:19:42.228 --> 00:19:43.270
Mamma!

240
00:19:43.936 --> 00:19:45.520
Sam, welcome!

241
00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:47.436
Gurmeet...

242
00:19:49.645 --> 00:19:50.436
Here you are.

243
00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:46.728
Where have you
been posted?


244
00:20:48.228 --> 00:20:49.186
And when do you
have to leave?


245
00:20:58.311 --> 00:21:00.228
Allied armies gather
for new thrusts


246
00:21:00.353 --> 00:21:03.061
against further Japanese
penetration in Burma.


247
00:21:03.186 --> 00:21:06.936
World War II has reached
India's doorstep.


248
00:21:07.353 --> 00:21:09.353
To counter the
Japanese troops,


249
00:21:09.478 --> 00:21:11.520
the Indian Army
has reached Burma.


250
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:29.645
As soon as we hit Sittang,

251
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.770
we'll give our soldiers
a meal break, Turq.


252
00:21:32.936 --> 00:21:34.853
They've fought non-stop
for 4 days...


253
00:21:36.603 --> 00:21:38.770
If securing the bridge
wasn't so urgent,


254
00:21:38.895 --> 00:21:40.270
I would've requested
Colonel Edwards


255
00:21:40.395 --> 00:21:42.436
to give us a day
before moving.


256
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:46.270
I'm pretty starved myself!

257
00:21:46.936 --> 00:21:48.478
I'd give anything
for some Dhansak.


258
00:21:48.686 --> 00:21:50.061
- Dhansak?
- Yes!


259
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.520
Most folks swear
by Rogan Josh,


260
00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.603
but Parsi food
has my heart.


261
00:21:54.978 --> 00:21:56.228
Come home for
a meal someday,


262
00:21:56.353 --> 00:21:57.186
you'll be in for a treat!

263
00:21:57.311 --> 00:22:00.936
Patra ni machhi, Akoori,
Lagan nu bhonu...


264
00:22:01.145 --> 00:22:02.270
Chicken Farcha,

265
00:22:02.395 --> 00:22:03.520
Salli Boti,

266
00:22:03.603 --> 00:22:04.895
Lagan nu custard!

267
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.270
Oh, man!

268
00:22:07.103 --> 00:22:09.853
Feed me some of that
delicious Parsi food again...


269
00:22:10.645 --> 00:22:12.853
and Attiqur Rahman
will be your slave for life!


270
00:22:14.895 --> 00:22:16.728
Just be my friend, Turq...

271
00:22:17.395 --> 00:22:18.770
and every week,
you can enjoy both:


272
00:22:18.895 --> 00:22:20.936
my company and
Parsi food as well!


273
00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:22.478
Sounds great!

274
00:22:28.145 --> 00:22:29.228
Down! Down!

275
00:23:00.686 --> 00:23:01.645
Thank God,

276
00:23:01.853 --> 00:23:03.603
our planes chased
the Japanese away!


277
00:23:03.853 --> 00:23:04.895
- All okay?
- Yes.


278
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.978
Check the company
and report to me!


279
00:23:12.895 --> 00:23:14.186
Slowly, slowly...

280
00:23:37.145 --> 00:23:39.353
One, two, three...

281
00:23:40.436 --> 00:23:41.395
Go!

282
00:23:43.686 --> 00:23:44.645
Subedar Sahib!

283
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.728
Yes, Sir.

284
00:23:45.936 --> 00:23:47.270
Get ready to move.

285
00:23:47.395 --> 00:23:48.270
Meher Singh!

286
00:23:48.603 --> 00:23:50.603
Come on! Get moving!

287
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:19.353
We have lost around 50 men.

288
00:24:19.728 --> 00:24:21.353
Vehicles and equipment too.

289
00:24:21.645 --> 00:24:22.520
From friendly fire

290
00:24:22.645 --> 00:24:24.061
from our own planes!

291
00:24:24.311 --> 00:24:25.936
A reconnaissance aircraft

292
00:24:26.103 --> 00:24:27.603
relayed wrong information.

293
00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:29.311
It was assumed

294
00:24:29.395 --> 00:24:30.603
that the Japanese
were on the move.


295
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.645
It is unfortunate...

296
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:36.645
But we have our orders.

297
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.020
We cannot let the enemy

298
00:24:38.145 --> 00:24:39.686
take control of the bridge.

299
00:24:40.561 --> 00:24:41.686
So gentlemen...

300
00:24:42.436 --> 00:24:43.895
talk to your men now,

301
00:24:44.228 --> 00:24:45.311
and get them ready.

302
00:24:47.186 --> 00:24:47.978
Sir.

303
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.978
This won't be easy...

304
00:24:55.395 --> 00:24:57.061
Is war ever easy?

305
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.520
Sittang Bridge.

306
00:25:04.228 --> 00:25:07.061
It's the only way
to get to Rangoon.


307
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.686
If Rangoon falls,

308
00:25:10.936 --> 00:25:12.145
we fall too.

309
00:25:13.478 --> 00:25:15.811
So we just cannot
allow the Japanese


310
00:25:15.936 --> 00:25:18.186
to capture Sittang Bridge.

311
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.853
Opposite Sittang Bridge
is Buddha Hill,


312
00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:24.645
and on the left
is Pagoda Hill.


313
00:25:25.145 --> 00:25:27.061
Apart from reinforcing
the bridgehead,


314
00:25:27.186 --> 00:25:29.020
we have to capture
these hills too.


315
00:25:29.353 --> 00:25:30.228
It will help us guard

316
00:25:30.311 --> 00:25:32.270
and secure the bridge
in a better way.


317
00:25:32.603 --> 00:25:33.645
And yes...

318
00:25:36.728 --> 00:25:38.270
Because time is short,

319
00:25:39.811 --> 00:25:42.061
the wounded and deceased

320
00:25:42.853 --> 00:25:45.145
will not be brought
back to camp


321
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.311
until the operation
is complete.


322
00:25:53.603 --> 00:25:54.561
Any doubts?

323
00:25:54.936 --> 00:25:55.686
Any questions?

324
00:26:09.728 --> 00:26:10.936
I know...

325
00:26:12.978 --> 00:26:15.061
this is your fifth day
without sleep.


326
00:26:17.145 --> 00:26:19.061
You've had your first meal
in four days


327
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.978
here at Sittang...

328
00:26:22.478 --> 00:26:25.103
And we lost 50 of our men
on the way here...


329
00:26:25.228 --> 00:26:27.853
That too, because of
a misunderstanding.


330
00:26:36.353 --> 00:26:38.478
"He alone is brave"

331
00:26:38.728 --> 00:26:41.020
"Who fights for
the downtrodden"


332
00:26:42.978 --> 00:26:45.186
"He may get cut
into pieces"


333
00:26:46.853 --> 00:26:49.186
"But he'll never leave
the battlefield!"


334
00:26:56.353 --> 00:26:59.186
I'm sure you've all heard
this holy verse before.


335
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.103
I'm just reminding you...

336
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.353
It's our turn to fight tomorrow.

337
00:27:13.853 --> 00:27:15.811
Bole So Nihaal!

338
00:27:15.978 --> 00:27:18.103
Sat Sri Akal!

339
00:27:29.895 --> 00:27:30.645
Are we ready

340
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:31.936
Subedar Gurbaksh Singh Sahib?

341
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.645
Yes, Sir. We're all set.

342
00:27:41.103 --> 00:27:43.103
They are on Buddha Hill!

343
00:27:44.436 --> 00:27:46.811
They are on Buddha Hill!

344
00:27:51.853 --> 00:27:54.686
The Japanese have reached
Buddha Hill before us!


345
00:27:58.228 --> 00:28:01.145
We must capture Pagoda Hill
before them. Now!


346
00:28:01.353 --> 00:28:03.228
Bravo Company shall
stay in reserve.


347
00:28:03.478 --> 00:28:05.353
Alpha Company,
charge to Pagoda Hill!


348
00:28:05.478 --> 00:28:06.520
Meher Singh!

349
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.145
Move, fast!

350
00:28:19.145 --> 00:28:20.103
Keep going!

351
00:28:20.228 --> 00:28:22.228
Don't let the enemy
reach the peak!


352
00:28:57.478 --> 00:28:58.686
We have to get the Japanese

353
00:28:58.811 --> 00:29:00.061
off Buddha Hill too,
Subedar Sahib.


354
00:29:00.186 --> 00:29:02.228
You guard this position
with your platoon...


355
00:29:02.353 --> 00:29:03.936
the rest will charge
with me.


356
00:29:04.228 --> 00:29:05.895
Bole So Nihaal!

357
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:07.561
Sat Sri Akal!

358
00:29:43.478 --> 00:29:45.770
Don't stop!
Charge ahead!


359
00:29:48.561 --> 00:29:49.686
Meher Singh...

360
00:29:49.895 --> 00:29:51.311
I had said...

361
00:29:52.353 --> 00:29:54.895
Only once the operation
is complete...


362
00:30:17.728 --> 00:30:20.353
Bravo Company is also
reaching Buddha Hill, Sir!


363
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.020
It is too late to
operate on him.


364
00:30:35.228 --> 00:30:36.228
He will not live.

365
00:30:36.353 --> 00:30:38.061
His eyes were open
moments ago.


366
00:30:39.478 --> 00:30:41.103
Please treat him!

367
00:30:43.103 --> 00:30:44.270
Can you hear me, son?

368
00:30:46.936 --> 00:30:48.145
How do you feel?

369
00:30:51.478 --> 00:30:52.728
I'm OK!

370
00:30:55.561 --> 00:30:56.811
What happened to you?

371
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.978
A bloody mule
kicked me!


372
00:31:05.478 --> 00:31:07.020
Anyone with this
sense of humour


373
00:31:07.145 --> 00:31:07.978
is worth saving!

374
00:31:08.061 --> 00:31:09.561
Get him ready
for surgery.


375
00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:31.728
For gallantry,

376
00:31:32.228 --> 00:31:34.270
during the action
at the Sittang Bridge


377
00:31:34.395 --> 00:31:37.478
on the 22nd and 23rd
of February 1942,


378
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:38.978
Major General Cowan

379
00:31:39.186 --> 00:31:42.436
awards Major SHFJ Manekshaw

380
00:31:42.853 --> 00:31:44.728
an immediate Military Cross.

381
00:31:57.228 --> 00:31:59.145
Congratulations, 
Major Manekshaw.

382
00:32:00.811 --> 00:32:01.936
Thank you, Sir!

383
00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:10.145
Wow!

384
00:32:13.145 --> 00:32:14.311
MC!

385
00:32:15.478 --> 00:32:16.561
Well done, Sam!

386
00:32:17.186 --> 00:32:18.686
You definitely owe me
a Parsi feast


387
00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:20.228
at your home now!

388
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.478
You'll be back much
before me, Turq.


389
00:32:25.645 --> 00:32:27.145
I'll be tied up here

390
00:32:27.978 --> 00:32:29.353
in these bandages,
for a while.


391
00:32:29.478 --> 00:32:31.436
In British India, it was the
wedding of the daughter


392
00:32:31.561 --> 00:32:34.603
of the Indian National Congress
President Jawaharlal Nehru.


393
00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:36.770
Several members were
present on the occasion


394
00:32:36.895 --> 00:32:38.020
and blessed the new couple,

395
00:32:38.145 --> 00:32:39.978
Indira Nehru and Feroze Gandhi.

396
00:32:40.228 --> 00:32:41.520
Good choice...

397
00:32:42.103 --> 00:32:43.686
Parsis do make good husbands!

398
00:32:49.936 --> 00:32:51.061
The true answer
to this question,


399
00:32:51.186 --> 00:32:52.936
I would like to hear
from Mrs Manekshaw...


400
00:32:53.853 --> 00:32:55.978
Do Parsis really make

401
00:32:56.603 --> 00:32:57.770
the best husbands?

402
00:33:00.186 --> 00:33:02.020
I'll only let Mrs Khan
in on this secret,


403
00:33:02.145 --> 00:33:03.228
Major Khan!

404
00:33:03.478 --> 00:33:04.520
And not in front of

405
00:33:04.603 --> 00:33:06.061
the two of you, for sure!

406
00:33:08.811 --> 00:33:10.061
Sherry, Maja...

407
00:33:10.395 --> 00:33:11.686
say goodnight to Major Khan.

408
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:13.478
But Silloo, the custard!

409
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.270
Custard on Sundays
for you.


410
00:33:15.478 --> 00:33:16.728
You know the rules.

411
00:33:18.686 --> 00:33:19.811
Goodnight, Major Khan.

412
00:33:19.936 --> 00:33:21.186
- Goodnight, Father.
- Goodnight, darling.


413
00:33:21.311 --> 00:33:22.478
Goodnight, Silloo.

414
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.020
Goodnight, Silloo!

415
00:33:31.853 --> 00:33:32.811
Major Khan,

416
00:33:33.103 --> 00:33:35.061
we'd love to meet
Begum Sahiba someday...


417
00:33:35.478 --> 00:33:36.603
Surely...

418
00:33:37.603 --> 00:33:38.728
Though...

419
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.145
the Missus has instantly
become 'Begum Sahiba'...


420
00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:43.395
Then why such formality
towards me?


421
00:33:44.145 --> 00:33:46.686
Not 'Major Khan',
please call me Yahya.


422
00:33:48.145 --> 00:33:49.436
On one condition...

423
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:51.728
You too, must call me Silloo.

424
00:33:52.936 --> 00:33:54.103
Definitely, Mrs...

425
00:33:55.936 --> 00:33:56.978
Silloo.

426
00:33:57.603 --> 00:33:58.311
So next time,

427
00:33:58.395 --> 00:34:00.061
please bring Begum Sahiba along,

428
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.686
Yahya.

429
00:34:01.811 --> 00:34:02.853
Surely...

430
00:34:03.061 --> 00:34:04.436
She was a bit unwell today.

431
00:34:05.311 --> 00:34:06.811
Or else she would've
loved to come


432
00:34:06.895 --> 00:34:09.061
and listen to Sam's tales
from Burma.


433
00:34:09.436 --> 00:34:10.353
Burma!

434
00:34:10.561 --> 00:34:12.436
Yahya, when I think of Burma,

435
00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.103
I'm reminded of
the doctors there...


436
00:34:14.228 --> 00:34:16.395
Those bloody buggers,
I tell you...


437
00:34:16.853 --> 00:34:18.895
They gave me such
bad stitches...


438
00:34:19.103 --> 00:34:20.811
that by the time
I returned to India,


439
00:34:20.936 --> 00:34:22.228
they were infested
with maggots!


440
00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:24.395
Even the maggots were
better than those doctors.


441
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.478
Thanks to them,

442
00:34:25.603 --> 00:34:26.895
I didn't get any infection.

443
00:34:27.478 --> 00:34:28.436
Excuse me.

444
00:34:35.686 --> 00:34:36.645
Sam...

445
00:34:37.686 --> 00:34:39.436
war gives us stories...

446
00:34:40.186 --> 00:34:41.561
but to women...

447
00:34:42.936 --> 00:34:44.228
they give nightmares.

448
00:35:00.186 --> 00:35:01.186
Silloo...

449
00:35:03.603 --> 00:35:05.436
Get custard made tomorrow.

450
00:35:06.936 --> 00:35:08.061
Sam!

451
00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:10.978
They're kids, Silloo...

452
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.478
Where to?

453
00:35:22.353 --> 00:35:23.478
My room...

454
00:35:25.395 --> 00:35:26.811
Because of these?

455
00:35:32.561 --> 00:35:34.353
Because of your snoring, Sam!

456
00:35:40.228 --> 00:35:41.978
The land will be divided.

457
00:35:42.728 --> 00:35:44.061
Areas with Hindus in majority

458
00:35:44.186 --> 00:35:45.686
will become their country.

459
00:35:46.061 --> 00:35:47.395
Areas with Muslim majority

460
00:35:47.561 --> 00:35:48.770
will become the Muslim nation.

461
00:35:50.478 --> 00:35:52.686
What mercenaries
the British are...


462
00:35:53.978 --> 00:35:56.395
The price they've made us
pay for our freedom!


463
00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:10.270
Turq has chosen Pakistan.

464
00:36:11.186 --> 00:36:12.561
He was saying that

465
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.395
Mr Jinnah has personally asked you

466
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.061
to join the Pakistan Army.

467
00:36:17.353 --> 00:36:18.186
So?

468
00:36:19.103 --> 00:36:20.436
What have you decided?

469
00:36:20.728 --> 00:36:21.895
You're not a Hindu.

470
00:36:22.145 --> 00:36:23.561
How are you an Indian, then?

471
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:25.228
I was born in Amritsar,

472
00:36:25.353 --> 00:36:26.520
my wife is from Bombay,

473
00:36:26.645 --> 00:36:28.186
and I work in Delhi...

474
00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.520
How much more Indian
can I be?


475
00:36:39.478 --> 00:36:40.478
Morning, boys!

476
00:36:40.645 --> 00:36:41.645
What's happening?

477
00:36:42.186 --> 00:36:43.436
We've been given orders, Sir...

478
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.728
Indian and Pakistani territory
maps are being divided.


479
00:36:45.853 --> 00:36:47.270
The maps falling
in Indian territory


480
00:36:47.395 --> 00:36:48.353
will be with the Indian army,

481
00:36:48.436 --> 00:36:49.853
and the ones falling
in Pakistani territory


482
00:36:49.978 --> 00:36:51.311
will go to the Pakistan army.

483
00:36:56.353 --> 00:36:57.645
The maps of the Pakistan areas

484
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.270
will not leave this office

485
00:36:59.395 --> 00:37:00.853
until the Indian army

486
00:37:00.978 --> 00:37:02.436
has a copy of them.

487
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:03.811
Is that clear?

488
00:37:03.936 --> 00:37:04.895
Yes, Sir.

489
00:37:06.478 --> 00:37:07.686
- Sir.
- Yes?


490
00:37:07.853 --> 00:37:09.436
Major Khan hasn't asked
for Indian maps...


491
00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:10.436
I know.

492
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.436
- But... how do...
- Because I know Yahya.


493
00:37:12.728 --> 00:37:14.728
He can feel the oncoming Partition...

494
00:37:15.103 --> 00:37:16.770
but he can't fathom it yet.

495
00:37:32.478 --> 00:37:34.770
Congrats on the Frontier Force Regiment,
Captain Farid.


496
00:37:35.061 --> 00:37:37.186
And to you on the Madras Regiment,
Captain Srini.


497
00:37:37.436 --> 00:37:38.020
Cheers.

498
00:37:38.145 --> 00:37:38.853
Cheers.

499
00:37:51.103 --> 00:37:52.103
This one...

500
00:37:53.061 --> 00:37:54.936
to all the brothers
in this room!


501
00:37:55.603 --> 00:37:57.395
I love you more
than life itself.


502
00:37:57.686 --> 00:37:58.311
Speech!

503
00:37:58.436 --> 00:38:00.936
Speech, speech, speech!

504
00:38:01.478 --> 00:38:04.811
Speech, speech, speech!

505
00:38:05.353 --> 00:38:06.561
Okay, okay...

506
00:38:13.353 --> 00:38:14.311
To the fatal choice!

507
00:38:14.436 --> 00:38:15.186
Punjabi!

508
00:38:15.395 --> 00:38:18.228
Punjabi! Punjabi! Punjabi!

509
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:21.228
Fine!

510
00:38:21.853 --> 00:38:22.520
Here.

511
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.186
Tonight, I raise a toast,

512
00:38:26.686 --> 00:38:28.686
to the cruel choice
before us!


513
00:38:30.895 --> 00:38:32.645
They make a goddamn porridge...

514
00:38:32.853 --> 00:38:35.145
then ask us to separate
the oats from the milk!


515
00:38:42.103 --> 00:38:43.978
The colour of this uniform

516
00:38:44.895 --> 00:38:47.228
is seeped into our blood...

517
00:38:49.353 --> 00:38:50.770
And now they ask us

518
00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.895
to choose another colour!

519
00:39:04.895 --> 00:39:05.645
Here...

520
00:39:09.061 --> 00:39:11.811
They slit us down the middle
and then ask us


521
00:39:12.853 --> 00:39:15.103
to choose one side
of our heart.


522
00:39:31.436 --> 00:39:32.311
To the Army!

523
00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:33.436
To the Army!

524
00:39:33.686 --> 00:39:34.770
To the Army!

525
00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.061
To the Army!

526
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.061
To the Indian Army!

527
00:39:50.645 --> 00:39:51.561
Sam...

528
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.520
Every morning,
I'd wake up thinking:


529
00:39:56.103 --> 00:39:58.228
I'll meet Sam again today.

530
00:40:00.436 --> 00:40:01.311
But now...

531
00:40:02.811 --> 00:40:05.561
now, after this Partition...

532
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:09.145
I have only one wish.

533
00:40:10.686 --> 00:40:13.061
That I never have
to meet Sam again.


534
00:40:40.686 --> 00:40:41.645
Sam...

535
00:40:44.311 --> 00:40:46.061
I'll really miss you.

536
00:40:48.103 --> 00:40:49.395
And your bike too.

537
00:40:51.103 --> 00:40:53.186
You both have taken
such good care of me.


538
00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:56.853
Keep the bike, then.

539
00:40:57.228 --> 00:40:59.270
Hey, Sam!

540
00:40:59.853 --> 00:41:01.186
Thank you!

541
00:41:02.061 --> 00:41:03.228
1500 rupees.

542
00:41:05.936 --> 00:41:07.436
You're selling it?

543
00:41:08.061 --> 00:41:09.353
How heartless!

544
00:41:09.728 --> 00:41:11.270
Not heartless, sensible.

545
00:41:11.978 --> 00:41:13.520
I'm leaving the bike outside...

546
00:41:13.728 --> 00:41:15.311
send me the money later.

547
00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:22.228
Goodnight, my friend...

548
00:41:25.103 --> 00:41:26.270
And goodbye.

549
00:41:43.603 --> 00:41:45.186
Long years ago,

550
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:48.061
we made a tryst
with destiny,


551
00:41:48.895 --> 00:41:51.228
and now the time comes

552
00:41:51.728 --> 00:41:54.020
when we shall redeem
our pledge.


553
00:41:54.853 --> 00:41:57.145
At the stroke of the
midnight hour,


554
00:41:57.603 --> 00:41:59.353
when the world sleeps...

555
00:41:59.978 --> 00:42:02.853
India will awake to
life and freedom.


556
00:42:26.936 --> 00:42:27.978
Maharaja Hari Singh

557
00:42:28.103 --> 00:42:30.395
has made an appeal
to us and Pakistan...


558
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.520
The Standstill Agreement...

559
00:42:33.978 --> 00:42:35.770
This is Pakistan's response.

560
00:42:39.061 --> 00:42:40.770
Pakistan has agreed.

561
00:42:41.311 --> 00:42:42.853
That until talks take place

562
00:42:42.978 --> 00:42:44.478
between their leaders

563
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.311
Pakistan will not take

564
00:42:46.436 --> 00:42:48.020
any action on Kashmir.

565
00:42:50.686 --> 00:42:52.186
That means we'll
have to accept


566
00:42:52.311 --> 00:42:53.561
the Maharaja's request too.

567
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.103
I don't think India
should agree.


568
00:42:58.436 --> 00:43:00.061
Neither should you disagree.

569
00:43:01.478 --> 00:43:03.520
Until the Maharaja
makes up his mind,


570
00:43:03.603 --> 00:43:05.520
which country he wants
to be a part of...


571
00:43:07.186 --> 00:43:08.395
Don't say yes...

572
00:43:09.311 --> 00:43:10.436
Don't say no.

573
00:43:11.895 --> 00:43:14.603
Did you advise
Pakistan similarly,


574
00:43:14.853 --> 00:43:15.936
Lord Mountbatten?

575
00:43:17.395 --> 00:43:19.103
Because they have accepted

576
00:43:19.311 --> 00:43:21.020
the Maharaja's request.

577
00:43:26.311 --> 00:43:27.686
I wonder why...

578
00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:35.311
What a great parting gift
they've given us!


579
00:43:36.895 --> 00:43:37.895
They came to one country,

580
00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.853
and they're leaving behind two!

581
00:43:41.645 --> 00:43:43.311
Hindustan and Pakistan...

582
00:43:43.645 --> 00:43:45.186
Hindus and Muslims...

583
00:43:45.895 --> 00:43:47.478
Divide and Rule!

584
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.603
What a legacy these
Britishers are leaving us...


585
00:44:14.103 --> 00:44:15.020
Sir.

586
00:45:09.728 --> 00:45:10.270
Hazara,

587
00:45:10.436 --> 00:45:11.103
Afridi,

588
00:45:11.228 --> 00:45:11.978
Mahsud...

589
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:14.603
Even Pakistan army soldiers

590
00:45:14.686 --> 00:45:16.728
who were on leave...

591
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.936
are crossing the border
in truckloads


592
00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:22.395
to attack Srinagar!

593
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.603
And you all knew
about this.


594
00:45:24.978 --> 00:45:25.936
The CGS,

595
00:45:26.103 --> 00:45:27.353
the Officiating DMO,

596
00:45:27.561 --> 00:45:29.103
and the Defence Minister!

597
00:45:29.645 --> 00:45:31.103
When were you planning
to inform me?


598
00:45:31.311 --> 00:45:33.270
After the Pakistan flag
has unfurled over Srinagar?


599
00:45:33.978 --> 00:45:35.895
The intel wasn't solid.
Kalkat's report-


600
00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.520
I don't want to hear a word
from you anymore.


601
00:45:38.978 --> 00:45:40.561
Major Kalkat, you tell me.

602
00:45:41.228 --> 00:45:42.145
I'll decide

603
00:45:42.353 --> 00:45:43.770
whether the intel
is solid or not.


604
00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.061
'Operation Gulmarg'
is a masterstroke, Sir.


605
00:45:46.311 --> 00:45:48.186
One solution to Pakistan's
three problems.


606
00:45:48.395 --> 00:45:50.103
The Pathanistan Movement
will be crushed.


607
00:45:50.395 --> 00:45:52.478
The tribals will get land
for settlement,


608
00:45:52.853 --> 00:45:54.478
and Kashmir will belong
to Pakistan.


609
00:45:54.728 --> 00:45:55.811
And you're sure

610
00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.353
the Pakistan Army
is involved?


611
00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:58.686
Yes, Sir.

612
00:45:58.811 --> 00:46:00.770
Pakistan Commander-in-Chief
General Messervy


613
00:46:00.895 --> 00:46:03.270
sent the operation plan
to Brigadier C P Murray.


614
00:46:03.561 --> 00:46:04.811
As soon as I found out,

615
00:46:05.061 --> 00:46:06.603
they put me under
house arrest...


616
00:46:06.936 --> 00:46:07.936
But I escaped.

617
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:10.020
Brigadier Murray knew,

618
00:46:10.145 --> 00:46:11.770
but he still didn't
inform us...


619
00:46:14.353 --> 00:46:16.186
Is the Partition between us
not enough...


620
00:46:16.686 --> 00:46:17.645
that we have to be
at war now, too?


621
00:46:18.145 --> 00:46:20.603
Kashmir needs our help,
Sardar...


622
00:46:20.728 --> 00:46:21.936
Yes, but we need

623
00:46:22.061 --> 00:46:24.436
Maharaja Hari Singh's
decision first:


624
00:46:25.936 --> 00:46:27.895
That Kashmir is
a part of India.


625
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.145
No?

626
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.895
Menon...

627
00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.186
Leave for Srinagar
right away...


628
00:46:39.728 --> 00:46:40.561
And...

629
00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:43.603
Take Manekshaw with you.

630
00:46:43.936 --> 00:46:44.811
Yes.

631
00:46:46.561 --> 00:46:47.853
Keep both the airfields ready...

632
00:46:48.061 --> 00:46:49.853
and keep a unit at hand,
on standby.


633
00:46:50.103 --> 00:46:51.770
Also, find out how many
more Dakotas


634
00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:52.978
we have on the ready.

635
00:46:53.186 --> 00:46:54.103
Relay all this information

636
00:46:54.186 --> 00:46:55.853
to Srinagar airfield as well...

637
00:46:55.978 --> 00:46:57.436
I need all of this done
in the next hour.


638
00:46:57.561 --> 00:46:58.353
Sir.

639
00:47:06.728 --> 00:47:07.603
Major.

640
00:47:09.895 --> 00:47:11.353
Our pilot has informed us

641
00:47:11.436 --> 00:47:13.186
that the Srinagar airfield runway

642
00:47:13.311 --> 00:47:14.228
does not have lights.

643
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.936
So?

644
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.353
So we must take-off

645
00:47:17.478 --> 00:47:19.270
for Delhi before sunset.

646
00:47:22.353 --> 00:47:24.811
So we have only
half an hour to do this?


647
00:47:27.645 --> 00:47:28.686
According to the latest reports,

648
00:47:28.811 --> 00:47:29.895
the armed tribal groups

649
00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.353
have reached Baramullah.

650
00:47:31.936 --> 00:47:34.061
Only 35 miles away
from Srinagar.


651
00:47:34.895 --> 00:47:36.145
If they get to Srinagar

652
00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:37.936
with the Pakistan Army's help

653
00:47:38.061 --> 00:47:40.645
and capture the airfield...

654
00:47:41.311 --> 00:47:44.478
the Indian army will not
be able to reach Srinagar.


655
00:47:44.853 --> 00:47:46.770
We will lose Kashmir.

656
00:48:20.936 --> 00:48:21.853
Maharaj...

657
00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.686
Secretary VP Menon and-

658
00:48:23.811 --> 00:48:25.561
You've taken so long
to arrive...


659
00:48:26.353 --> 00:48:29.020
while those plunderers
are taking over Kashmir!


660
00:48:29.728 --> 00:48:31.478
Seems like I'll have to
handle this on my own.


661
00:48:31.645 --> 00:48:32.728
I'll fight...

662
00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:34.436
I'll fight with my army!

663
00:48:34.561 --> 00:48:35.645
Your Highness...

664
00:48:35.728 --> 00:48:37.311
We came as soon as
we got the news.


665
00:48:37.436 --> 00:48:38.936
I've been calling for help,
for so long...


666
00:48:39.061 --> 00:48:40.478
And you just got the news?

667
00:48:41.811 --> 00:48:43.145
You've come too late.

668
00:48:44.103 --> 00:48:45.686
This is my home...

669
00:48:46.186 --> 00:48:47.353
and to protect it,

670
00:48:47.436 --> 00:48:48.603
I'm ready to spill blood...

671
00:48:48.728 --> 00:48:50.645
whether it's mine,
or of my enemies.


672
00:48:54.686 --> 00:48:55.686
Your Highness...

673
00:48:56.895 --> 00:48:57.853
Please come.

674
00:48:58.478 --> 00:49:00.103
You want to spill
blood, right?


675
00:49:00.478 --> 00:49:01.686
Please come...

676
00:49:05.311 --> 00:49:06.936
The M1 Garand...

677
00:49:07.686 --> 00:49:09.061
30 caliber, gas-operated,

678
00:49:09.186 --> 00:49:10.478
8-shot, clip fed.

679
00:49:11.395 --> 00:49:12.561
Easy to fire.

680
00:49:12.728 --> 00:49:13.853
Easy to handle.

681
00:49:13.978 --> 00:49:15.270
And reloads in an instant.

682
00:49:15.728 --> 00:49:16.645
A trained soldier can

683
00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:18.728
fire 15-20 accurate
shots per minute


684
00:49:18.936 --> 00:49:21.478
to a distance of
about 300 yards.


685
00:49:21.603 --> 00:49:23.103
I'm sure you'll easily manage

686
00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:25.311
8-10 shots at the very least.

687
00:49:27.811 --> 00:49:29.895
This is war, Your Highness.

688
00:49:31.395 --> 00:49:34.061
My soldiers and I
are trained for it.


689
00:49:35.478 --> 00:49:36.728
You please handle
the politics,


690
00:49:36.853 --> 00:49:38.770
as you are trained for it.

691
00:49:40.603 --> 00:49:41.645
Your Highness...

692
00:49:42.228 --> 00:49:43.270
Please come.

693
00:49:57.436 --> 00:49:59.228
I'll see you at the airfield,
Mr Menon.`


694
00:50:11.936 --> 00:50:12.978
Is it done?

695
00:50:13.686 --> 00:50:14.978
But there's no point...

696
00:50:15.478 --> 00:50:17.145
We won't be able
to reach Delhi.


697
00:50:17.395 --> 00:50:19.270
How will we take off
in this darkness, Sam?


698
00:50:53.978 --> 00:50:54.770
I can now see

699
00:50:54.853 --> 00:50:57.103
why I was asked
to take you along.


700
00:51:38.853 --> 00:51:40.228
What's the matter, Sam?

701
00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:42.311
Mission accomplished.

702
00:51:42.645 --> 00:51:43.978
Bosses will be happy!

703
00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.853
My boss won't be happy.

704
00:51:49.686 --> 00:51:50.603
I had promised her

705
00:51:50.728 --> 00:51:52.436
that I'd be back home by 7.

706
00:51:55.103 --> 00:51:55.936
And in any case,

707
00:51:56.061 --> 00:51:57.895
only your mission
is accomplished.


708
00:51:59.311 --> 00:52:00.353
Our mission will

709
00:52:01.228 --> 00:52:02.478
begin only now.

710
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.228
In a fierce war
spanning 2 years


711
00:52:21.311 --> 00:52:23.395
the Indian Army
and Air Force


712
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.186
secured Srinagar
and cleared Kashmir


713
00:52:25.353 --> 00:52:27.103
from Poonch to Dras
-Kargil

714
00:52:27.228 --> 00:52:30.686
of the Tribal and
Pakistani invaders.


715
00:52:50.645 --> 00:52:53.270
Even the song is
not playing now!


716
00:52:55.353 --> 00:52:57.603
He has become the Commandant
of the Staff College,


717
00:52:57.728 --> 00:52:59.061
happily running the place,

718
00:52:59.186 --> 00:53:00.228
training officers...

719
00:53:00.353 --> 00:53:01.686
And what did I get?

720
00:53:02.645 --> 00:53:04.603
A matchbox-sized kitchen!

721
00:53:05.603 --> 00:53:07.436
If Sir keeps getting
promoted like this,


722
00:53:07.561 --> 00:53:09.728
I'll soon be cooking,
sitting inside a saucepan!


723
00:53:13.061 --> 00:53:15.270
This is Akashvani.
And now the news.


724
00:53:15.395 --> 00:53:16.978
The Indian National Congress held

725
00:53:17.103 --> 00:53:18.645
a special election in Delhi.

726
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:20.603
The Congress Committee
has selected


727
00:53:20.728 --> 00:53:21.770
Mrs Indira Gandhi

728
00:53:21.853 --> 00:53:23.478
as their new President.

729
00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:29.728
Major General Manekshaw...

730
00:53:30.103 --> 00:53:31.186
I must admit,

731
00:53:31.478 --> 00:53:32.603
you run a tight ship here.

732
00:53:32.728 --> 00:53:33.978
Thank you, Sir.

733
00:53:40.978 --> 00:53:45.228
What could be more reassuring
for a Defence Minister...


734
00:53:46.103 --> 00:53:47.395
Than knowing that
the responsibility


735
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.020
of training this country's officers

736
00:53:49.436 --> 00:53:50.686
is in your able hands!

737
00:53:50.895 --> 00:53:52.061
Right, Kaul?

738
00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:53.311
Sir.

739
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.686
Thank you, Minister.

740
00:53:55.186 --> 00:53:56.228
I have some suggestions

741
00:53:56.353 --> 00:53:57.853
for your training module, Sam...

742
00:53:58.061 --> 00:53:59.353
which can make it better.

743
00:53:59.811 --> 00:54:01.020
Of course, Sir!

744
00:54:01.478 --> 00:54:02.978
I'm sure we can
greatly benefit


745
00:54:03.103 --> 00:54:05.478
from your extensive
war experience.


746
00:54:06.145 --> 00:54:07.353
By the way...

747
00:54:08.436 --> 00:54:10.603
Which front did you fight at?

748
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.645
He may not have
field experience,


749
00:54:13.895 --> 00:54:17.728
but he surely has the
mind of a strategist.


750
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:20.186
I'm sure!

751
00:54:20.686 --> 00:54:22.145
This way, gentlemen!

752
00:54:26.353 --> 00:54:28.603
There's something else
I wanted to ask you, Sam...


753
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.478
I wanted your opinion...

754
00:54:30.728 --> 00:54:32.645
on a few Officers.

755
00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.478
My opinion goes straight
into my Officers'


756
00:54:36.603 --> 00:54:38.936
Annual Confidential Reports,
Minister.


757
00:54:40.061 --> 00:54:41.728
I don't mean 'your' Officers...

758
00:54:41.895 --> 00:54:43.728
I'm talking about your Chief.

759
00:54:44.145 --> 00:54:47.103
What do you think of
General Thimmayaa?


760
00:54:47.311 --> 00:54:48.686
Please don't.

761
00:54:50.103 --> 00:54:52.520
Today, you're asking me
about my Chief...


762
00:54:52.686 --> 00:54:53.895
Tomorrow, you'll ask

763
00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:56.311
my Brigadiers and Colonels
about me.


764
00:54:57.353 --> 00:54:59.020
The Army's discipline

765
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.228
is its very foundation.

766
00:55:01.811 --> 00:55:04.478
Don't shake the Army's foundation...

767
00:55:05.228 --> 00:55:05.895
...Minister.

768
00:55:26.228 --> 00:55:27.228
What happened at the DSSC

769
00:55:27.353 --> 00:55:28.728
was totally out of line, Sir.

770
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:32.603
So what if I don't have
war experience?


771
00:55:32.811 --> 00:55:34.020
I'm his senior officer,

772
00:55:34.145 --> 00:55:35.936
and the Chief of General Staff!

773
00:55:38.145 --> 00:55:39.603
That's why he's jealous of me.

774
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:42.520
And that's why he hates me!

775
00:55:42.645 --> 00:55:43.603
No, no...

776
00:55:43.728 --> 00:55:45.395
Sam doesn't hate anyone.

777
00:55:45.936 --> 00:55:47.853
He just loves himself more.

778
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:49.811
The only problem is

779
00:55:49.936 --> 00:55:52.770
that everyone else
loves him too.


780
00:55:53.353 --> 00:55:55.061
Especially PM Nehru.

781
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.145
We must do something, Sir.

782
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.145
Anti
-National?

783
00:56:15.145 --> 00:56:17.020
Apart from anti-national activity,

784
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.270
there are other
serious charges too.


785
00:56:19.478 --> 00:56:21.520
An enquiry must be done, Kaul...

786
00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:23.228
But Anti
-Nationalism?

787
00:56:23.311 --> 00:56:24.895
This letter, such charges...?

788
00:56:25.436 --> 00:56:26.770
You've seen his office, right?

789
00:56:28.103 --> 00:56:30.270
It's been 14 years
since Independence


790
00:56:30.811 --> 00:56:32.728
but he's still loyal
to the British.


791
00:56:33.478 --> 00:56:34.395
He's forgotten

792
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.145
that his seniors and ministers

793
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:37.895
are all Indian.

794
00:56:38.353 --> 00:56:39.770
His biggest problem is...

795
00:56:39.895 --> 00:56:41.145
Not one problem...

796
00:56:43.436 --> 00:56:45.186
There's a list of problems.

797
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.395
But is this list

798
00:56:56.728 --> 00:56:58.270
enough for an enquiry?

799
00:56:59.478 --> 00:57:02.395
We're talking about
Major General Sam Manekshaw, Kaul...


800
00:57:02.853 --> 00:57:04.645
not some junior officer
or Corporal!


801
00:57:04.853 --> 00:57:05.770
Of course, Sir.

802
00:57:12.978 --> 00:57:14.020
And...

803
00:57:14.853 --> 00:57:16.186
this enquiry will take place

804
00:57:16.395 --> 00:57:18.228
under the General Staff Branch.

805
00:57:20.061 --> 00:57:21.520
Impressive, Kaul!

806
00:57:22.478 --> 00:57:23.978
So it's your field,

807
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:25.728
and your rules...

808
00:57:26.311 --> 00:57:27.561
You've set this up
quiet efficiently!


809
00:57:39.478 --> 00:57:40.811
Manekshaw residence.

810
00:57:41.728 --> 00:57:42.603
Hello...

811
00:57:43.978 --> 00:57:44.936
Hello?

812
00:57:45.186 --> 00:57:46.186
Sehroo Bhai.

813
00:57:46.645 --> 00:57:48.603
Silloo... what's the matter?

814
00:57:49.061 --> 00:57:51.353
No, it's nothing...

815
00:57:52.603 --> 00:57:53.936
Just that inquiry.

816
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:55.603
And Sam?

817
00:57:56.561 --> 00:57:57.728
Sam...

818
00:57:58.645 --> 00:57:59.811
You know him...

819
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.561
Ask him anything,

820
00:58:01.686 --> 00:58:02.895
the answer is the same:

821
00:58:03.853 --> 00:58:04.978
"I'm OK!"

822
00:58:06.645 --> 00:58:08.686
Anti
-National, and you?

823
00:58:12.561 --> 00:58:13.520
Sam...

824
00:58:15.686 --> 00:58:17.353
I think this is personal.

825
00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:20.061
This Kaul...

826
00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:22.395
He's always been
jealous of you.


827
00:58:23.436 --> 00:58:26.061
Professional disagreements
are routine, Silloo...


828
00:58:26.853 --> 00:58:29.061
Why would Kaul have a
personal problem with me?


829
00:58:30.145 --> 00:58:32.645
You never see any problem
in anyone, Sam...


830
00:58:33.603 --> 00:58:36.020
You think everyone's
good at heart.


831
00:58:40.645 --> 00:58:41.686
What if...

832
00:58:43.728 --> 00:58:45.186
What if they win, Sam?

833
00:58:52.353 --> 00:58:54.145
I already won

834
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:56.978
my life's biggest challenge

835
00:58:57.103 --> 00:58:59.145
the night you agreed

836
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:01.478
to dance with me
at that party.


837
00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.395
I'll handle the other
battles as well.


838
00:59:05.811 --> 00:59:06.770
I'm OK!

839
00:59:07.186 --> 00:59:08.020
Trust me...

840
00:59:09.103 --> 00:59:11.103
And everything will be OK.

841
00:59:12.145 --> 00:59:13.061
Soon.

842
00:59:13.353 --> 00:59:14.353
I promise.

843
00:59:17.311 --> 00:59:18.270
Come inside...

844
00:59:19.103 --> 00:59:21.478
Sherry's getting her
boyfriend to meet us...


845
00:59:22.228 --> 00:59:23.478
That Batliwala?

846
00:59:26.811 --> 00:59:28.728
Sam... the house is that way.

847
00:59:28.978 --> 00:59:30.061
Silloo...

848
00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:33.061
Our daughter will become
'Sherry Batliwala'!


849
00:59:33.853 --> 00:59:35.228
I can handle the inquiry,

850
00:59:35.353 --> 00:59:37.395
but this is too much!

851
00:59:49.478 --> 00:59:51.186
This Court of inquiry
has assembled


852
00:59:51.395 --> 00:59:54.228
to investigate into the
incidents of impropriety


853
00:59:54.353 --> 00:59:58.645
by Major General Sam Hormusji
Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw,


854
00:59:58.811 --> 00:59:59.853
Military Cross.

855
00:59:59.978 --> 01:00:01.478
That have been brought
to the notice


856
01:00:01.603 --> 01:00:02.811
of the convening authority.

857
01:00:08.436 --> 01:00:09.728
Everything alright?

858
01:00:10.811 --> 01:00:13.395
This... isn't right, Sir.

859
01:00:18.978 --> 01:00:20.603
Things will be alright...

860
01:00:21.103 --> 01:00:22.686
It will be OK.

861
01:00:34.186 --> 01:00:35.103
The first matter against

862
01:00:35.228 --> 01:00:36.895
Major General Manekshaw is

863
01:00:37.353 --> 01:00:38.436
Anti
-Nationalism.

864
01:00:40.395 --> 01:00:42.645
Is it true that
at the Staff College,


865
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:44.811
instead of Indian leaders,

866
01:00:45.436 --> 01:00:47.270
you've put up portraits
of British Viceroys,


867
01:00:47.395 --> 01:00:49.645
Army chiefs and Generals?

868
01:00:51.186 --> 01:00:52.311
Yes, it's true...

869
01:00:53.603 --> 01:00:56.936
because the DSSC
trains Army Officers,


870
01:00:57.728 --> 01:00:58.978
not Politicians.

871
01:01:04.478 --> 01:01:05.770
The second charge is:

872
01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:08.353
Violating the orders
of your senior Officer.


873
01:01:08.686 --> 01:01:10.561
Wilful Disobedience.

874
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:13.061
It says here,
Major General Manekshaw,


875
01:01:13.186 --> 01:01:16.145
that you received a letter
from the office


876
01:01:16.561 --> 01:01:19.353
of the Chief of General Staff
B M Kaul.


877
01:01:20.561 --> 01:01:23.436
That you deliberately ignored.

878
01:01:25.061 --> 01:01:26.395
You mean he was expecting

879
01:01:26.603 --> 01:01:28.145
a response to that?

880
01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:31.520
My apologies

881
01:01:31.603 --> 01:01:32.978
that I failed to send

882
01:01:33.103 --> 01:01:34.603
an appropriate reply.

883
01:01:35.103 --> 01:01:36.978
Let me correct that
mistake right away.


884
01:01:40.103 --> 01:01:43.478
The CGS's letter asked
for 50 soldiers


885
01:01:43.603 --> 01:01:45.770
to complete the construction

886
01:01:45.895 --> 01:01:47.770
of barracks swiftly.

887
01:01:50.603 --> 01:01:52.686
I will not give my soldiers, Sir.

888
01:01:54.186 --> 01:01:56.895
But yes, if he requires
workers or labourers,


889
01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.603
I know a few contractors.

890
01:01:58.728 --> 01:02:00.936
I can connect the CGS to them.

891
01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:04.228
Perhaps they can also explain
the difference to him...


892
01:02:04.436 --> 01:02:06.228
About what labourers do...

893
01:02:06.811 --> 01:02:08.353
and what soldiers do.

894
01:02:23.603 --> 01:02:25.770
Sir, someone in the mess
told me...


895
01:02:25.936 --> 01:02:27.145
So you never actually heard

896
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:29.270
Major General Manekshaw
say this in person?


897
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.478
No, Sir.

898
01:02:31.311 --> 01:02:32.061
No, Sir..

899
01:02:32.186 --> 01:02:34.311
Colonel, did you
or did you not hear


900
01:02:34.478 --> 01:02:36.270
Major General Manekshaw say:

901
01:02:36.395 --> 01:02:38.020
'He doesn't want his Officers

902
01:02:38.145 --> 01:02:40.728
'to marry women who
resemble housemaids'?


903
01:02:46.311 --> 01:02:47.645
It is time to conclude

904
01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:49.811
the findings of this
Court of inquiry.


905
01:02:50.186 --> 01:02:51.436
I agree, General.

906
01:02:51.936 --> 01:02:53.645
We needn't waste
any more time


907
01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.228
on useless questions.

908
01:02:56.228 --> 01:02:59.686
Major General Sam Hormusji
Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw...


909
01:03:00.353 --> 01:03:01.811
This Committee believes
that all charges


910
01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:03.145
raised in this inquiry

911
01:03:03.228 --> 01:03:04.395
are unjustified.

912
01:03:05.311 --> 01:03:06.478
They are utterly baseless

913
01:03:06.603 --> 01:03:07.770
and without any merit.

914
01:03:08.645 --> 01:03:09.728
Therefore...

915
01:03:09.936 --> 01:03:10.895
This enquiry is

916
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.395
terminated.

917
01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:30.978
It took some time...

918
01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:32.853
But I had told you...

919
01:03:33.311 --> 01:03:34.936
It will be OK.

920
01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:45.895
Swami...

921
01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:48.895
The most important thing in
a sandwich isn't the bread...


922
01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:52.228
but the filling in between!

923
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:54.853
There should be more of it!

924
01:03:55.728 --> 01:03:57.478
The market is short
on supplies


925
01:03:57.603 --> 01:03:59.270
because of the war.

926
01:04:00.686 --> 01:04:04.645
Very soon, the sandwiches
will have no filling at all!


927
01:04:05.853 --> 01:04:07.103
These Chinese!

928
01:04:07.228 --> 01:04:09.145
The very mention of them
makes me fume!


929
01:04:09.978 --> 01:04:10.895
That's it!

930
01:04:11.061 --> 01:04:12.728
I'm banning fine china
in the house.


931
01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.020
From now on,
we'll only use steel.


932
01:04:15.645 --> 01:04:16.603
Boycott China!

933
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:19.561
I've been saying
this for ages,


934
01:04:19.686 --> 01:04:21.478
Filter coffee tastes better
in steel mugs!


935
01:04:21.686 --> 01:04:23.103
And I also taught you

936
01:04:23.228 --> 01:04:25.145
how to make authentic
filter coffee, didn't I?


937
01:04:27.395 --> 01:04:29.811
Your filter coffee is
far from authentic!


938
01:04:30.978 --> 01:04:33.686
God knows how
Madam tolerates him!


939
01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:41.061
And now, an important
announcement...


940
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:43.353
After China's attack on Assam,

941
01:04:43.478 --> 01:04:45.853
Prime Minister
Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru


942
01:04:46.061 --> 01:04:47.895
shall address the nation...

943
01:04:49.436 --> 01:04:52.353
Chinese forces have been

944
01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:55.270
aggressively attacking
our borders.


945
01:04:57.311 --> 01:04:58.436
Right now...

946
01:04:59.728 --> 01:05:04.353
Enemy forces are
at Assam's doorstep.


947
01:05:05.561 --> 01:05:07.436
And Assam is in danger.

948
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:12.228
We have lost
Bomdila as well.


949
01:05:13.311 --> 01:05:16.520
At this moment,

950
01:05:18.478 --> 01:05:20.520
my heart truly goes out

951
01:05:20.895 --> 01:05:24.811
to our brothers and sisters
in Assam.


952
01:05:25.603 --> 01:05:29.311
It pains me to think
of their suffering,


953
01:05:29.811 --> 01:05:32.145
No, Prime Minister!

954
01:05:32.853 --> 01:05:34.270
This isn't right.

955
01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:36.895
Why?

956
01:05:38.395 --> 01:05:41.353
'My heart goes out
to the people of Assam'?


957
01:05:41.978 --> 01:05:44.186
He sounds so helpless!

958
01:05:44.603 --> 01:05:46.353
If the Prime Minister

959
01:05:47.145 --> 01:05:49.020
is going to comes across
as feeble and helpless


960
01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.020
who will give hope and
courage to our people?


961
01:05:51.395 --> 01:05:53.686
"Indian and Chinese,
brothers-in-arms!"


962
01:05:54.103 --> 01:05:55.978
What backstabbing brothers!

963
01:05:56.436 --> 01:05:57.978
Of course he's helpless.

964
01:06:01.478 --> 01:06:02.436
Sam...

965
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:06.686
What about the promotion?

966
01:06:07.728 --> 01:06:08.770
Any news?

967
01:06:14.311 --> 01:06:16.770
You should have been
a part of this war, Sam...


968
01:06:18.436 --> 01:06:19.686
You're a soldier.

969
01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.770
You belong at the front...

970
01:06:23.478 --> 01:06:25.145
with the other soldiers.

971
01:06:31.061 --> 01:06:34.145
I know that Swami wants me
out of the house...


972
01:06:34.686 --> 01:06:36.478
but you, too?

973
01:06:42.353 --> 01:06:44.811
I don't want you
to go anywhere, Sam.


974
01:06:46.561 --> 01:06:48.311
I just want you to reach
where you're destined.


975
01:06:52.186 --> 01:06:54.061
But your destiny is

976
01:06:54.853 --> 01:06:56.520
not going to fulfil itself.

977
01:07:01.895 --> 01:07:03.770
Tell me, what do I do?

978
01:07:05.186 --> 01:07:07.686
What do I tell you Sam?

979
01:07:09.145 --> 01:07:10.811
I can't fathom anything myself.

980
01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:12.811
This war, this defeat...

981
01:07:15.145 --> 01:07:16.853
I can't see my own future.

982
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:20.853
How do I tell you about yours?

983
01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:38.145
I'm sorry, but
this is important.


984
01:07:40.395 --> 01:07:42.311
Please give us 5 minutes.

985
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:44.395
Prime Minister.

986
01:07:47.228 --> 01:07:50.061
After your speech,
there's chaos in Tezpur.


987
01:07:50.645 --> 01:07:52.520
People have lost faith
in the Army,


988
01:07:52.686 --> 01:07:53.895
and the Government.

989
01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:58.895
China may have betrayed us,

990
01:07:59.103 --> 01:08:01.145
but we've been careless too!

991
01:08:01.478 --> 01:08:03.061
We've failed to prepare
our troops


992
01:08:03.186 --> 01:08:04.895
to combat the Chinese army,

993
01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.978
or provide them with
weapons and equipment.


994
01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.811
Instead of making

995
01:08:09.936 --> 01:08:11.603
our Army combat-ready,

996
01:08:11.895 --> 01:08:13.520
we were making them
do construction work!


997
01:08:17.477 --> 01:08:19.770
Krishna Menon must resign.

998
01:08:20.727 --> 01:08:21.477
And...

999
01:08:22.477 --> 01:08:24.895
Y B Chavan will be our
new Defense Minister.


1000
01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.686
Kaul must go too.

1001
01:08:29.352 --> 01:08:31.186
But in this situation,

1002
01:08:31.477 --> 01:08:33.145
who can replace him?

1003
01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:38.561
I know.

1004
01:08:43.645 --> 01:08:44.686
The gentleman in
the waiting room -


1005
01:08:44.811 --> 01:08:45.852
Please send him inside.

1006
01:08:54.061 --> 01:08:56.561
I believe you know
Major General Sam Manekshaw.


1007
01:08:56.686 --> 01:08:58.436
Sam, Indira.

1008
01:09:13.770 --> 01:09:15.811
We'll rehearse the
Christmas Day scene.


1009
01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.311
It's Christmas morning.

1010
01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.436
Everything should be
relaxed and easy.


1011
01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:22.852
Bert and Lorraine
will be seated together.


1012
01:09:23.061 --> 01:09:24.602
Take your positions.

1013
01:09:32.561 --> 01:09:33.727
What happened?

1014
01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.770
How did it go?

1015
01:09:38.936 --> 01:09:40.186
Very good.

1016
01:09:42.477 --> 01:09:44.645
Finish your rehearsal,
I'll wait.


1017
01:09:45.477 --> 01:09:46.936
So let's take it
from the top...


1018
01:10:04.436 --> 01:10:04.978
So?

1019
01:10:06.186 --> 01:10:07.728
Where's our next posting?

1020
01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.520
Tezpur, Assam.

1021
01:10:15.228 --> 01:10:16.645
But not 'our' posting,

1022
01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.020
just mine.

1023
01:10:21.186 --> 01:10:23.520
It's a non-family station,
Silloo...


1024
01:10:24.228 --> 01:10:25.561
The on-ground situation

1025
01:10:25.686 --> 01:10:27.228
is still dangerous.

1026
01:10:28.478 --> 01:10:29.561
I know.

1027
01:10:30.186 --> 01:10:31.686
It's just that...

1028
01:10:34.395 --> 01:10:35.561
It's not easy.

1029
01:10:37.061 --> 01:10:37.978
I know.

1030
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:40.853
I know how tough it is

1031
01:10:40.978 --> 01:10:41.853
for you,

1032
01:10:43.186 --> 01:10:44.270
for us,

1033
01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:46.395
for the girls...

1034
01:10:51.686 --> 01:10:53.270
That's where you belong, Sam.

1035
01:10:54.936 --> 01:10:56.353
With your soldiers.

1036
01:10:58.645 --> 01:10:59.978
We will all be OK.

1037
01:11:12.103 --> 01:11:13.228
How is she?

1038
01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:15.478
Who?

1039
01:11:17.103 --> 01:11:17.936
Indira.

1040
01:11:22.186 --> 01:11:23.228
She dresses well.

1041
01:11:25.311 --> 01:11:27.436
And she's definitely,
less emotional


1042
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.061
than Prime Minister Nehru.

1043
01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.436
And is that a good
or bad thing?


1044
01:11:34.436 --> 01:11:35.686
Time will tell.

1045
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.853
The morale of the soldiers
is down, Sir.


1046
01:11:42.395 --> 01:11:45.103
We have failed in
encouraging them to fight


1047
01:11:45.228 --> 01:11:46.728
or even lead them well.

1048
01:11:47.395 --> 01:11:48.811
Delhi is so far
from Assam,


1049
01:11:48.936 --> 01:11:50.770
it feels like no one
remembers us.


1050
01:12:04.978 --> 01:12:06.645
Your quarters are
this way, Sir.


1051
01:12:08.186 --> 01:12:09.436
Commander Sir.

1052
01:12:26.978 --> 01:12:27.978
Good evening, gentlemen!

1053
01:12:28.103 --> 01:12:29.228
Good evening, Sir!

1054
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:32.936
What is the most
precious thing


1055
01:12:33.061 --> 01:12:34.520
for any human being?

1056
01:12:37.978 --> 01:12:39.645
Stop thinking about your own

1057
01:12:39.728 --> 01:12:40.770
and others' girlfriends!

1058
01:12:40.895 --> 01:12:41.895
Answer me, boys!

1059
01:12:43.853 --> 01:12:45.145
His life, Sir.

1060
01:12:47.561 --> 01:12:48.436
Correct.

1061
01:12:50.061 --> 01:12:51.770
But for a soldier,

1062
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:54.978
even more precious
than his life...


1063
01:12:55.103 --> 01:12:56.395
is his honour.

1064
01:12:56.978 --> 01:12:58.145
His uniform.

1065
01:12:59.603 --> 01:13:01.145
And to protect this honour,

1066
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:03.853
a soldier can even
sacrifice his life.


1067
01:13:04.478 --> 01:13:05.186
Right?

1068
01:13:05.436 --> 01:13:06.395
Yes, Sir.

1069
01:13:07.228 --> 01:13:09.061
You haven't eaten today?

1070
01:13:09.395 --> 01:13:10.353
Am I right?

1071
01:13:10.478 --> 01:13:11.520
Yes, Sir!

1072
01:13:13.311 --> 01:13:15.978
From today,
no officer or soldier


1073
01:13:17.228 --> 01:13:19.103
shall withdraw from his post

1074
01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.311
without my written orders...

1075
01:13:22.478 --> 01:13:23.686
And I am

1076
01:13:24.186 --> 01:13:25.686
never going to give
those orders!


1077
01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:27.561
Gentlemen,

1078
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.686
there will be
no more withdrawals.


1079
01:13:31.395 --> 01:13:32.603
Sam is here!

1080
01:13:32.811 --> 01:13:34.020
Yes, Sir!

1081
01:13:44.728 --> 01:13:47.311
This is the Commander Sir
we needed...


1082
01:13:48.103 --> 01:13:50.353
Who tells us what to do!

1083
01:13:51.686 --> 01:13:52.936
I know what to do.

1084
01:13:53.728 --> 01:13:54.561
We've been studying

1085
01:13:54.686 --> 01:13:57.353
the movements of the
Chinese forces for a while.


1086
01:13:57.561 --> 01:13:59.936
Our team has prepared a plan.

1087
01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:03.436
We need to strengthen
our forward posts,


1088
01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:05.728
protect our passes,

1089
01:14:05.853 --> 01:14:07.311
and most importantly...

1090
01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.145
we must secure our
borders with China.


1091
01:14:12.561 --> 01:14:13.478
Sam...

1092
01:14:13.686 --> 01:14:14.520
Sir.

1093
01:14:14.645 --> 01:14:17.186
Chairman Mao has
declared a ceasefire.


1094
01:14:19.478 --> 01:14:21.478
I don't think we
should violate it.


1095
01:14:23.478 --> 01:14:25.020
I agree with Panditji.

1096
01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:27.895
There is no need
for deployment right now.


1097
01:14:28.353 --> 01:14:29.353
A wait-and-watch position

1098
01:14:29.478 --> 01:14:30.353
is what we should take.

1099
01:14:31.603 --> 01:14:34.103
Besides, since you've
taken command,


1100
01:14:34.853 --> 01:14:36.520
the situation has
improved significantly.


1101
01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:39.395
The situation has returned

1102
01:14:39.561 --> 01:14:41.603
to normal with
great difficulty...


1103
01:14:43.436 --> 01:14:45.311
We should let it
remain normal.


1104
01:14:45.603 --> 01:14:47.145
Normal, Minister?

1105
01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:50.311
The situation was
so 'normal',


1106
01:14:50.436 --> 01:14:51.936
that my soldiers
wanted to leave


1107
01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:53.145
not just their posts,

1108
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:54.978
but the Army itself.

1109
01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.686
They don't want 'normal'.

1110
01:14:59.645 --> 01:15:01.520
What they want is a chance

1111
01:15:02.103 --> 01:15:04.728
to win back their lost honour.

1112
01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:07.520
They want reassurance,

1113
01:15:08.186 --> 01:15:10.436
that our government in Delhi
hasn't forgotten about them.


1114
01:15:12.686 --> 01:15:14.228
They don't want 'normal',
Minister...


1115
01:15:14.353 --> 01:15:15.270
They want to win.

1116
01:15:15.395 --> 01:15:18.270
And I want to win.

1117
01:15:23.061 --> 01:15:24.353
China will withdraw
its troops


1118
01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.270
before the passes
close down.


1119
01:15:27.103 --> 01:15:28.728
Or their supply line
will be cut off


1120
01:15:28.853 --> 01:15:29.895
and we'll crush them.

1121
01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.895
I don't think they will
make that error.


1122
01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:34.020
Instead of waiting for them

1123
01:15:34.145 --> 01:15:35.353
to make a move,

1124
01:15:35.478 --> 01:15:37.936
we must secure
ourselves first.


1125
01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:43.311
And if you can't
trust my soldiers


1126
01:15:43.436 --> 01:15:45.228
and give them
this chance,


1127
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:48.145
I'm afraid I have
nothing to do here,


1128
01:15:48.228 --> 01:15:49.978
please send me back.

1129
01:15:54.978 --> 01:15:56.728
You're not going
anywhere, Sam.


1130
01:15:59.603 --> 01:16:01.811
Our soldiers are
raring to win.


1131
01:16:02.436 --> 01:16:04.478
If we don't support them,
who will?


1132
01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:06.936
So we'll just let our soldiers
become cannon fodder?


1133
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:08.728
It is a soldier's duty

1134
01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:10.311
to die for the nation.

1135
01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.603
I beg your pardon, Madam.

1136
01:16:12.561 --> 01:16:14.020
A soldier's duty is

1137
01:16:14.145 --> 01:16:17.311
to kill the enemy and
protect the nation.


1138
01:16:20.811 --> 01:16:21.811
Okay, Sam.

1139
01:16:22.395 --> 01:16:23.395
What do you suggest?

1140
01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.603
Shall we head
to the Ops room?


1141
01:16:24.728 --> 01:16:26.478
We've identified some posts

1142
01:16:26.561 --> 01:16:28.061
which must be secured.

1143
01:16:35.145 --> 01:16:36.228
Panditji!

1144
01:16:37.103 --> 01:16:38.728
Shall we go to
the Guest House?


1145
01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:42.895
I think it's the heat
and humidity, that's all...


1146
01:16:43.353 --> 01:16:46.228
You will feel better in
two minutes, Prime Minister.


1147
01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:05.645
I'm sorry, Madam...

1148
01:17:06.228 --> 01:17:07.603
You don't have
security clearance


1149
01:17:07.686 --> 01:17:08.978
for the Ops Room.

1150
01:17:09.811 --> 01:17:10.978
Please wait here.

1151
01:17:20.186 --> 01:17:22.061
That's the spirit, gentlemen!

1152
01:17:22.228 --> 01:17:23.020
Yes, Sir!

1153
01:17:23.145 --> 01:17:25.061
5 Div will dare their lives

1154
01:17:25.186 --> 01:17:27.395
to protect their land
and honour.


1155
01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.186
Yes, Sir!

1156
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:30.270
And no one can snatch
this away from you!


1157
01:17:30.395 --> 01:17:31.103
Yes, Sir!

1158
01:17:31.228 --> 01:17:33.311
- Badri Vishal Lal ki!
- Jai!


1159
01:17:33.395 --> 01:17:35.395
- Badri Vishal Lal ki!
- Jai!


1160
01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.561
India's first Prime Minister,

1161
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:47.478
Mr Jawaharlal Nehru

1162
01:17:47.603 --> 01:17:49.853
has passed away
due to a heart attack.


1163
01:17:50.436 --> 01:17:53.020
74-year old
Pandit Nehru's health


1164
01:17:53.353 --> 01:17:55.145
had been on the decline
for a while.


1165
01:17:55.311 --> 01:17:59.145
The entire country
mourns his death today.


1166
01:18:07.145 --> 01:18:08.395
On the face of it,

1167
01:18:09.353 --> 01:18:11.311
since China declared
a ceasefire,


1168
01:18:13.311 --> 01:18:16.853
both armies decided
to lay low.


1169
01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:21.020
But the flames of discord
rising in Nagaland,


1170
01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:23.020
are being fanned
by China.


1171
01:18:23.686 --> 01:18:25.478
We also need to control

1172
01:18:25.603 --> 01:18:27.436
the civil unrest in Calcutta,

1173
01:18:27.561 --> 01:18:28.728
Mr Defence Minister.

1174
01:18:29.728 --> 01:18:30.645
So tell me Sam...

1175
01:18:31.103 --> 01:18:32.186
what have you thought?

1176
01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.103
Where do you want
to be posted next?


1177
01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:38.311
I wasn't aware that
the Indian Army


1178
01:18:38.436 --> 01:18:40.770
gives its Officers a choice!

1179
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:44.353
Or is it because
you want to


1180
01:18:44.478 --> 01:18:46.270
send me somewhere far off?

1181
01:18:46.895 --> 01:18:48.228
What do you think, Sam...

1182
01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:51.561
Which is the most
challenging posting


1183
01:18:51.645 --> 01:18:52.811
in the Indian Army?

1184
01:19:00.811 --> 01:19:01.728
Wonderful!

1185
01:19:02.645 --> 01:19:03.811
China on one side,

1186
01:19:03.936 --> 01:19:05.603
East Pakistan on the other...

1187
01:19:05.728 --> 01:19:07.103
and problems all around!

1188
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:10.270
Why did you have to pick
the Eastern Command?


1189
01:19:22.978 --> 01:19:24.895
Just choose any
nice photo, Sam...


1190
01:19:25.853 --> 01:19:27.936
It's been a year since
Sherry's wedding,


1191
01:19:28.311 --> 01:19:29.811
and you still can't decide

1192
01:19:29.936 --> 01:19:31.353
which photo to frame!

1193
01:19:31.936 --> 01:19:33.978
You can't take a
single decision at home,


1194
01:19:34.103 --> 01:19:36.020
God knows how you
manage the Army!


1195
01:19:36.936 --> 01:19:40.020
Doesn't listen to anyone.
Just does his own thing!


1196
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:45.561
What's the matter, Swami?

1197
01:19:45.895 --> 01:19:46.936
What's the matter?

1198
01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:51.520
Before my transistor
can find its frequency,


1199
01:19:51.645 --> 01:19:53.353
your new transfer order arrives!

1200
01:20:19.895 --> 01:20:21.020
At ease, boys.

1201
01:20:21.228 --> 01:20:22.061
What's going on?

1202
01:20:22.186 --> 01:20:23.728
The Rifleman is
saluting me, Sir!


1203
01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:24.895
I can see that.

1204
01:20:25.145 --> 01:20:25.728
Any reason?

1205
01:20:25.936 --> 01:20:27.020
I was on my rounds, Sir.

1206
01:20:27.186 --> 01:20:28.895
Rifleman Tamang
didn't salute me.


1207
01:20:29.311 --> 01:20:31.103
For not saluting
a senior Officer,


1208
01:20:31.353 --> 01:20:32.478
I've given Rifleman Tamang

1209
01:20:32.603 --> 01:20:34.186
a punishment of
a 1000 salutes!


1210
01:20:35.311 --> 01:20:36.103
Tamang?

1211
01:20:36.478 --> 01:20:37.520
It was an honest mistake, Sir.

1212
01:20:37.686 --> 01:20:39.228
I didn't see the Captain.

1213
01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:41.311
Good job, Captain.

1214
01:20:41.478 --> 01:20:42.353
Thank you, Sir!

1215
01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.478
That's how we maintain
discipline in the unit!


1216
01:20:45.686 --> 01:20:46.603
Carry on!

1217
01:20:54.561 --> 01:20:56.228
The Army has a rule -

1218
01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:59.561
a salute must be
reciprocated with a salute.


1219
01:20:59.853 --> 01:21:01.645
So Captain,

1220
01:21:02.395 --> 01:21:04.270
you will return every salute

1221
01:21:04.395 --> 01:21:05.561
from Rifleman Tamang.

1222
01:21:23.978 --> 01:21:24.811
Very well!

1223
01:21:32.436 --> 01:21:33.353
Come, Behroze.

1224
01:21:36.145 --> 01:21:37.561
Sir, just a reminder:

1225
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:39.186
Today is the soldiers' feast.

1226
01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:41.478
We will drink rum, Behroze.

1227
01:21:41.686 --> 01:21:43.061
Arrange rum for everyone.

1228
01:21:43.436 --> 01:21:44.270
Sir.

1229
01:21:46.395 --> 01:21:48.353
In the Congress Party's
legislative elections,


1230
01:21:48.478 --> 01:21:50.645
Mrs Indira Gandhi has
beaten Mr Morarji Desai


1231
01:21:50.770 --> 01:21:52.728
by a margin of 186 votes.

1232
01:21:53.395 --> 01:21:54.770
Winning a total of 355 votes,

1233
01:21:54.895 --> 01:21:56.561
Mrs Indira Gandhi is elected as

1234
01:21:56.686 --> 01:21:58.186
India's third Prime Minister.

1235
01:21:58.353 --> 01:22:01.270
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance


1236
01:22:01.603 --> 01:22:03.186
to the Constitution of India,

1237
01:22:03.395 --> 01:22:05.311
to the Constitution of India,

1238
01:22:05.811 --> 01:22:07.645
as by law established.

1239
01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.520
as by law established.

1240
01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.520
Congratulations!

1241
01:22:14.895 --> 01:22:16.186
Cheers!

1242
01:22:20.145 --> 01:22:21.436
- Hey Joe...
- Yes, Sir.


1243
01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:22.978
- How's your wife?
- Fine, Sir.


1244
01:22:23.228 --> 01:22:24.228
Still afraid of her?

1245
01:22:24.311 --> 01:22:25.770
Not at all, Sir.
No fear!


1246
01:22:25.895 --> 01:22:27.020
No fear!

1247
01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.061
Well, those who claim
to have no fear...


1248
01:22:30.561 --> 01:22:31.936
are either liars,

1249
01:22:32.145 --> 01:22:33.561
or they are Gorkhas!

1250
01:22:34.228 --> 01:22:35.645
- Right, Sir!
- Right, Sir!


1251
01:22:36.895 --> 01:22:37.853
Hey, Behroze!

1252
01:22:38.936 --> 01:22:40.478
Whenever I look at you,

1253
01:22:40.603 --> 01:22:42.978
you must have a drink
in your hand!


1254
01:22:43.145 --> 01:22:44.395
That's an order!

1255
01:22:48.103 --> 01:22:51.145
Sir, why do you call Behram
'Behroze'?


1256
01:22:51.728 --> 01:22:53.478
This bugger, I tell you!

1257
01:22:53.978 --> 01:22:55.520
Got selected in the Army,

1258
01:22:55.645 --> 01:22:57.353
and got posted in Signals.

1259
01:22:57.728 --> 01:22:58.686
One day, during lunch,

1260
01:22:58.811 --> 01:23:00.311
he calls me and says:

1261
01:23:00.686 --> 01:23:02.520
'Sir, if I can't work with you,

1262
01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:04.020
I'll quit the Army!'

1263
01:23:04.936 --> 01:23:06.353
I was hungry,

1264
01:23:06.686 --> 01:23:07.603
and the line was poor...

1265
01:23:07.770 --> 01:23:08.978
I heard Behroze
instead of Behram.


1266
01:23:09.103 --> 01:23:11.061
And ever since,
he's Behroze to me!


1267
01:23:21.436 --> 01:23:22.645
Party over, gentlemen!

1268
01:23:22.895 --> 01:23:24.145
We have to get to work.

1269
01:23:27.561 --> 01:23:28.770
Sir, how did you know...

1270
01:23:28.895 --> 01:23:30.520
It has to be an emergency,
sweetie...


1271
01:23:30.728 --> 01:23:32.978
or you'd never disobey

1272
01:23:33.353 --> 01:23:34.561
my direct order.

1273
01:23:35.436 --> 01:23:36.228
Now tell me.

1274
01:23:36.436 --> 01:23:38.436
There have been attacks
in Lunglei and Aizawl.


1275
01:23:38.686 --> 01:23:39.895
Mizo National Front.

1276
01:23:50.686 --> 01:23:52.103
The MNF troops have made

1277
01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:53.645
the villagers' lives hell.

1278
01:23:54.061 --> 01:23:55.728
They take away their rations

1279
01:23:56.436 --> 01:23:58.145
and forcibly induct
their children


1280
01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:59.645
into their army.

1281
01:24:00.478 --> 01:24:02.270
Some of the locals
are our informants.


1282
01:24:02.561 --> 01:24:04.603
We call them 'Kawktu'
in the Mizo language.


1283
01:24:05.061 --> 01:24:05.936
Apart from the locals,

1284
01:24:06.061 --> 01:24:07.811
some Army and Police Officers

1285
01:24:08.186 --> 01:24:09.811
have also infiltrated the MNF.

1286
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:14.311
Sir, this is Officer Khuliana,

1287
01:24:14.853 --> 01:24:16.978
from the Manipur Police's
Intelligence branch.


1288
01:24:18.478 --> 01:24:20.103
He looks barely 14 or 15.

1289
01:24:20.395 --> 01:24:21.686
He's 16, Sir.

1290
01:24:22.311 --> 01:24:24.728
He calls himself
Lieutenant Miram.


1291
01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:26.770
He's my son.

1292
01:24:34.686 --> 01:24:36.811
I am sorry, Brigadier Miram.

1293
01:24:38.061 --> 01:24:38.978
No Sir...

1294
01:24:39.395 --> 01:24:41.770
no one forced him
into this.


1295
01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.686
It was his decision
to join them.


1296
01:24:48.603 --> 01:24:49.478
Sir!

1297
01:24:49.895 --> 01:24:50.686
Sir!

1298
01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.978
Please have mercy on me!

1299
01:24:58.936 --> 01:24:59.645
Sir!

1300
01:25:00.145 --> 01:25:00.811
Have mercy, please!

1301
01:25:05.436 --> 01:25:06.186
Sir.

1302
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:09.436
He was caught returning
from an MNF camp.


1303
01:25:13.228 --> 01:25:15.561
He had gone to call
his brother back home.


1304
01:25:17.686 --> 01:25:22.645
Sir, he was trying to bring
his brother back home.


1305
01:25:26.228 --> 01:25:28.770
Do they have reasons
to return home?


1306
01:25:31.436 --> 01:25:32.978
Escort them back
to their village.


1307
01:25:33.186 --> 01:25:34.186
No further action.

1308
01:25:34.311 --> 01:25:35.020
Sir.

1309
01:25:37.061 --> 01:25:37.728
Let's go!

1310
01:25:37.936 --> 01:25:39.061
Thank you, sir! Thank you!

1311
01:25:39.686 --> 01:25:40.520
My son!

1312
01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:44.270
These people are in a fix.

1313
01:25:46.978 --> 01:25:48.270
If they don't help the MNF,

1314
01:25:48.395 --> 01:25:50.061
they're brutally harassed...

1315
01:25:50.811 --> 01:25:53.770
and if they do, the Army
and Police punish them.


1316
01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:01.311
Nurse ask him to keep quiet!
Crying like a baby!


1317
01:26:05.478 --> 01:26:06.103
Sir...

1318
01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:08.020
Two attack units
were deployed


1319
01:26:08.145 --> 01:26:09.561
at the MNF's Vairengte base...

1320
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:12.353
but here the wounded soldiers
are from only one unit.


1321
01:26:22.686 --> 01:26:23.936
How many bullets
did you take?


1322
01:26:26.228 --> 01:26:27.145
That's it?

1323
01:26:27.478 --> 01:26:28.853
Crying over one bullet?

1324
01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:33.353
I had 9 Japanese bullets in me!

1325
01:26:33.895 --> 01:26:34.895
But I didn't die,

1326
01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:36.603
I became an Army Commander.

1327
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:39.228
You'll also become
a Subedar Major.


1328
01:26:39.895 --> 01:26:41.311
Now stop crying.

1329
01:26:55.645 --> 01:26:57.228
The second unit
is the one


1330
01:26:57.561 --> 01:26:59.478
that withdrew
without a fight.


1331
01:27:00.145 --> 01:27:01.603
That's why none
of their soldiers


1332
01:27:01.686 --> 01:27:03.020
lie wounded here.

1333
01:27:03.228 --> 01:27:04.395
That's right, Sir.

1334
01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:07.186
How far is the market
from here, Behroze?


1335
01:27:14.061 --> 01:27:15.520
From the Army Commander.

1336
01:27:34.645 --> 01:27:36.395
'If you can't wield guns,

1337
01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.520
you might as well
wear bangles!'


1338
01:27:52.853 --> 01:27:53.936
Charge! Charge!

1339
01:28:27.353 --> 01:28:28.853
The bangles did
the trick, Sir!


1340
01:28:29.186 --> 01:28:30.561
Both units together
have captured


1341
01:28:30.645 --> 01:28:32.020
five insurgents in Serchhip.

1342
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:36.395
Tell the CO to send
the bangles back.


1343
01:28:37.978 --> 01:28:38.895
And Sir...

1344
01:28:39.228 --> 01:28:40.395
The casualties also include

1345
01:28:40.561 --> 01:28:42.228
SS Lieutenant Miram.

1346
01:29:10.103 --> 01:29:11.936
For protecting our country...

1347
01:29:12.061 --> 01:29:13.603
against insurgent attacks

1348
01:29:13.728 --> 01:29:15.186
in North
-East India...

1349
01:29:15.853 --> 01:29:18.020
And displaying unmatched bravery

1350
01:29:18.145 --> 01:29:19.228
and exceptional acumen...

1351
01:29:19.603 --> 01:29:23.645
Lieutenant General Sam Hormusji
Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw


1352
01:29:24.186 --> 01:29:26.353
is awarded the Padma Bhushan.

1353
01:29:35.436 --> 01:29:37.853
Congratulations,
Lieutenant General Manekshaw.


1354
01:29:37.978 --> 01:29:39.311
Thank you, Sir.

1355
01:30:04.228 --> 01:30:05.561
My dear fellow citizens,

1356
01:30:05.645 --> 01:30:06.895
Asalam Walekum.

1357
01:30:07.186 --> 01:30:10.103
Today, I address all of you
for the last time


1358
01:30:10.228 --> 01:30:12.311
as the President of Pakistan.

1359
01:30:15.728 --> 01:30:17.103
This is Radio Pakistan.

1360
01:30:17.228 --> 01:30:18.728
Pakistan Army Commander-in-chief,

1361
01:30:18.853 --> 01:30:19.895
General Yahya Khan

1362
01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:21.686
shall now address the nation.

1363
01:30:22.436 --> 01:30:23.853
Fellow Pakistanis...

1364
01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:26.311
You have already heard

1365
01:30:26.561 --> 01:30:29.270
Field Marshal
Mohammad Ayub Khan's speech


1366
01:30:29.478 --> 01:30:31.603
which was broadcast yesterday.

1367
01:30:32.061 --> 01:30:33.520
He called upon me

1368
01:30:33.645 --> 01:30:36.145
to carry out my prime duty...

1369
01:30:36.728 --> 01:30:38.478
of protecting this country

1370
01:30:38.603 --> 01:30:40.561
from utter destruction.

1371
01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:43.270
As proclaimed earlier,

1372
01:30:43.770 --> 01:30:45.520
I have imposed Martial Law

1373
01:30:45.645 --> 01:30:47.061
throughout Pakistan.

1374
01:30:48.228 --> 01:30:50.020
I urge everyone of you

1375
01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:52.603
to cooperate with
my administration.


1376
01:30:54.395 --> 01:30:55.770
Egg fried rice,

1377
01:30:55.936 --> 01:30:58.061
tamarind and lemon candy.

1378
01:31:00.186 --> 01:31:02.561
Don't try to make
sense of it, Behroze...


1379
01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:03.978
Maja is pregnant,

1380
01:31:04.103 --> 01:31:05.561
and these are Silloo's orders.

1381
01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:07.061
I need to take these home.

1382
01:31:07.186 --> 01:31:07.978
Sir.

1383
01:31:12.686 --> 01:31:13.686
Good afternoon, Sir.

1384
01:31:13.811 --> 01:31:15.478
Connecting to
General Kumaramangalam.


1385
01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.145
Good afternoon, Sir.

1386
01:31:34.353 --> 01:31:35.228
Silloo!

1387
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:37.895
Silloo!

1388
01:31:44.770 --> 01:31:46.061
Maja's sleeping!

1389
01:31:46.603 --> 01:31:47.978
Do you know

1390
01:31:48.103 --> 01:31:50.270
who you're about to kiss?

1391
01:31:51.311 --> 01:31:52.686
I'm about to kiss someone?

1392
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:53.520
Yes...

1393
01:31:54.978 --> 01:31:56.811
Chief of Army Staff,

1394
01:31:57.145 --> 01:31:59.228
General Sam Manekshaw.

1395
01:32:02.936 --> 01:32:04.478
The promotion's great...

1396
01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:07.686
but what about the
size of the kitchen?


1397
01:32:13.228 --> 01:32:14.978
It had to be you, Sam!

1398
01:32:20.561 --> 01:32:22.103
One last question, General.

1399
01:32:22.561 --> 01:32:23.811
As Army Chief,
you must have


1400
01:32:23.936 --> 01:32:25.436
a packed schedule
in Delhi.


1401
01:32:25.936 --> 01:32:27.686
what brings you
to Pahalgam?


1402
01:32:28.145 --> 01:32:30.061
Is war on the anvil?

1403
01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.645
Oh no, sweetie...

1404
01:32:32.395 --> 01:32:34.353
I like meeting
my soldiers often.


1405
01:32:34.561 --> 01:32:36.353
I feel alive around them.

1406
01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:39.145
Now, is there anything else?

1407
01:32:39.395 --> 01:32:40.561
No, thank you.

1408
01:32:40.728 --> 01:32:41.561
Very well.

1409
01:32:41.811 --> 01:32:42.728
Dippy!

1410
01:32:44.561 --> 01:32:46.186
He is Lieutenant Colonel
Depinder Singh,


1411
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:47.728
my Military Assistant.

1412
01:32:48.395 --> 01:32:50.145
Will you please escort
the lady out, sweetie?


1413
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:52.645
You call everybody 'sweetie'?

1414
01:32:54.603 --> 01:32:57.478
Honestly, I thought you
were flirting with me!


1415
01:33:01.353 --> 01:33:02.478
Sweetie...

1416
01:33:03.436 --> 01:33:04.853
had I been flirting,

1417
01:33:04.978 --> 01:33:07.645
this interview would've
gone on much longer.


1418
01:33:27.478 --> 01:33:29.353
Guard...

1419
01:33:29.728 --> 01:33:32.270
For Inspection... Port Arms!

1420
01:33:44.811 --> 01:33:45.978
Guard...

1421
01:33:46.603 --> 01:33:47.936
Ground Arms!

1422
01:34:17.603 --> 01:34:18.603
What is your name?

1423
01:34:18.853 --> 01:34:20.228
Rifleman Harka Gurung, Sir!

1424
01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.686
Harka Gurung!

1425
01:34:22.228 --> 01:34:23.103
What is my name?

1426
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:25.103
Sam...

1427
01:34:25.686 --> 01:34:26.686
Mac...

1428
01:34:27.311 --> 01:34:28.353
Monk...

1429
01:34:28.686 --> 01:34:29.728
Sam Bahadur, Sir!

1430
01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:35.853
Sam Bahadur.

1431
01:34:42.061 --> 01:34:43.895
And now, international news...

1432
01:34:44.103 --> 01:34:47.311
American President
Mr Richard Nixon,


1433
01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.936
who is currently
on a world tour,


1434
01:34:49.061 --> 01:34:50.186
will soon arrive in India.

1435
01:34:50.311 --> 01:34:52.311
Get ready for the spectacle, Dippy!

1436
01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:54.311
May I ask you a question, Sir?

1437
01:34:54.603 --> 01:34:55.811
Apart from my wife's
phone number


1438
01:34:55.936 --> 01:34:57.478
and my bank account number,

1439
01:34:57.603 --> 01:34:58.645
you may ask me anything!

1440
01:34:58.936 --> 01:35:00.561
Don't you miss the action, Sir?

1441
01:35:01.561 --> 01:35:02.686
Being in Delhi,

1442
01:35:02.811 --> 01:35:04.020
away from your soldiers?

1443
01:35:04.228 --> 01:35:05.645
We're going to Delhi, Dippy...

1444
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:07.436
You'll realise that

1445
01:35:07.978 --> 01:35:10.311
battles aren't fought
only on the front.


1446
01:35:10.603 --> 01:35:12.145
President Yahya Khan
has finally lifted


1447
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:13.436
Martial Law in Pakistan.

1448
01:35:13.561 --> 01:35:16.103
The way General Ayub Khan
was overthrown...


1449
01:35:16.228 --> 01:35:17.520
What's new?

1450
01:35:19.103 --> 01:35:21.770
Yahya Khan himself was
appointed by Ayub Khan.


1451
01:35:22.061 --> 01:35:23.395
They were friends, right?

1452
01:35:25.353 --> 01:35:27.020
We were friends too.

1453
01:35:41.395 --> 01:35:42.436
Jai Hind, Sir.

1454
01:35:44.103 --> 01:35:45.645
Lance Naik Tejinder Singh, Sir.

1455
01:35:45.895 --> 01:35:47.061
You might not remember,

1456
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:49.186
back in 1954, my unit
was in your Brigade.


1457
01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.686
- Lance Naik Tejinder Singh?
- Sir.


1458
01:35:54.228 --> 01:35:57.686
Army Number 33 52 312.

1459
01:36:08.436 --> 01:36:10.728
Your first dinner function, Dippy?

1460
01:36:11.061 --> 01:36:12.728
Ready for some lessons?

1461
01:36:13.061 --> 01:36:14.561
You have a new name, Sir.

1462
01:36:17.936 --> 01:36:19.061
'Sam Bahadur'.

1463
01:36:19.311 --> 01:36:21.561
You've been called many
names by many people, Sam.


1464
01:36:21.728 --> 01:36:23.853
Often behind your back.

1465
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.561
But this name

1466
01:36:25.811 --> 01:36:27.145
is my favourite.

1467
01:36:36.603 --> 01:36:38.436
Is this table fine, darling?

1468
01:36:39.061 --> 01:36:40.603
I'll get you a drink.

1469
01:36:40.978 --> 01:36:42.061
Dippy...

1470
01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:50.936
How are you, Mr Sam?

1471
01:36:51.145 --> 01:36:51.936
Fine. And you?

1472
01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:53.895
All good! One moment...

1473
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:55.686
Oh hello...

1474
01:36:55.811 --> 01:36:57.770
One whiskey,
with lukewarm water.


1475
01:36:58.061 --> 01:36:58.770
So, Mr Sam...

1476
01:36:58.895 --> 01:36:59.936
One moment.

1477
01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:02.020
Young man!

1478
01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:05.270
What is your name, son?

1479
01:37:05.395 --> 01:37:06.478
Lieutenant Amar Sharma, Sir.

1480
01:37:06.603 --> 01:37:08.061
Lieutenant Sharma...

1481
01:37:08.853 --> 01:37:10.436
This is Defense Secretary Sarin.

1482
01:37:10.561 --> 01:37:11.853
He was a bit confused

1483
01:37:11.978 --> 01:37:13.770
that you're his server.

1484
01:37:14.603 --> 01:37:16.020
That's been cleared now.

1485
01:37:16.436 --> 01:37:17.520
Come, son.

1486
01:37:24.061 --> 01:37:26.686
I need to meet some people,
sweetie.


1487
01:37:27.228 --> 01:37:28.353
Will you be alright?

1488
01:37:28.686 --> 01:37:29.895
I'll be OK.

1489
01:37:37.811 --> 01:37:38.645
Dippy...

1490
01:37:39.561 --> 01:37:41.270
Sam told you about
some lessons, right?


1491
01:37:41.645 --> 01:37:42.561
Yes, Ma'am.

1492
01:37:42.853 --> 01:37:44.561
About how all battles are...

1493
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:46.895
Let me give you
a lesson, too.


1494
01:37:48.061 --> 01:37:49.978
How to conduct
business at a party


1495
01:37:50.145 --> 01:37:51.520
where you've brought
your wife!


1496
01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:53.520
As soon as you arrive,

1497
01:37:53.645 --> 01:37:55.728
seat your wife
at her favourite table,


1498
01:37:56.145 --> 01:37:57.561
get her favourite drink,

1499
01:37:58.061 --> 01:37:59.436
and once she settles,

1500
01:37:59.603 --> 01:38:01.103
disappear for 10 minutes.

1501
01:38:01.978 --> 01:38:02.770
Ma'am...

1502
01:38:03.728 --> 01:38:04.895
Don't believe me?

1503
01:38:05.728 --> 01:38:06.728
Alright.

1504
01:38:07.603 --> 01:38:09.645
Go to Sam, and watch.

1505
01:38:10.811 --> 01:38:11.811
Ma'am.

1506
01:38:14.603 --> 01:38:17.061
I believe Army Cantonments

1507
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:18.645
must be self-sufficient.

1508
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.520
Our soldiers deserve
a good life.


1509
01:38:21.811 --> 01:38:23.103
And besides,

1510
01:38:23.561 --> 01:38:24.936
it's important to know,

1511
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:26.478
exactly who lives where!

1512
01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:30.061
Absolutely.

1513
01:38:30.228 --> 01:38:31.686
Ex-servicemen should have

1514
01:38:31.811 --> 01:38:33.436
a minimum pension plan.

1515
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:35.228
It's their right.

1516
01:38:39.811 --> 01:38:41.978
One day, I'll retire too.

1517
01:38:42.103 --> 01:38:44.395
I must have enough money,

1518
01:38:44.478 --> 01:38:47.020
to entertain my
special guests then!


1519
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:48.895
You are too charming, General!

1520
01:38:48.978 --> 01:38:50.478
Thank you, sweetheart.

1521
01:38:50.603 --> 01:38:52.270
It's all thanks
to your presence!


1522
01:38:55.103 --> 01:38:56.353
You are looking lovely,

1523
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:58.311
Prime Minister.

1524
01:38:58.811 --> 01:38:59.895
Thank you, Sam...

1525
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:01.103
'Bahadur'.

1526
01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:05.228
You're in the news
quite a bit these days...


1527
01:39:05.311 --> 01:39:07.520
We can talk about me
another time, Prime Minister.


1528
01:39:07.645 --> 01:39:09.478
Can we discuss
the budget now?


1529
01:39:09.603 --> 01:39:10.603
Mr Sam...

1530
01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:12.061
Is this an occasion

1531
01:39:12.353 --> 01:39:13.686
to discuss the budget?

1532
01:39:13.811 --> 01:39:16.770
Mr Sarin, could there be
a better occasion?


1533
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:18.228
The Defense Secretary,

1534
01:39:18.395 --> 01:39:19.561
Defense Minister

1535
01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:21.228
and the Prime Minister,
are all here...


1536
01:39:21.936 --> 01:39:23.853
I need equipment
for the Army.


1537
01:39:24.645 --> 01:39:26.353
When I asked for
a budget hike


1538
01:39:26.478 --> 01:39:27.895
I was told that

1539
01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:29.561
the file would have to go

1540
01:39:29.686 --> 01:39:31.103
higher up for approval...

1541
01:39:32.353 --> 01:39:34.770
I fear that by the time
the file reaches you,


1542
01:39:34.895 --> 01:39:36.520
I would have retired.

1543
01:39:39.061 --> 01:39:40.061
I'll look into it.

1544
01:39:40.228 --> 01:39:41.186
Thank you, Prime Minister.

1545
01:39:41.353 --> 01:39:42.770
I'll take your leave now.

1546
01:39:47.103 --> 01:39:48.270
Didn't I tell you, Dippy...

1547
01:39:48.686 --> 01:39:50.645
Battles aren't just
fought on the front!


1548
01:39:51.061 --> 01:39:52.103
Correct, Sir.

1549
01:39:52.311 --> 01:39:53.811
I learnt a lot today.

1550
01:39:54.436 --> 01:39:56.936
But the most important
lesson I learnt today:


1551
01:39:57.686 --> 01:39:59.895
No matter how many wars
a man wins,


1552
01:40:00.311 --> 01:40:02.520
he's no match for
a woman's mind!


1553
01:40:09.395 --> 01:40:10.270
Hello, Sir.

1554
01:40:10.936 --> 01:40:12.478
Sir, he wanted to meet you.

1555
01:40:13.478 --> 01:40:14.853
I've heard a lot about you.

1556
01:40:19.353 --> 01:40:20.895
Dippy, schedule a meeting
over tea?


1557
01:40:28.395 --> 01:40:29.228
Sam!

1558
01:40:29.478 --> 01:40:30.020
Yes.

1559
01:40:30.145 --> 01:40:31.020
Phone.

1560
01:40:31.311 --> 01:40:32.436
Who is it?

1561
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:35.103
Who else!

1562
01:40:36.145 --> 01:40:36.853
Who?

1563
01:40:40.353 --> 01:40:41.311
Stay.

1564
01:40:51.686 --> 01:40:54.020
Is everything alright,
Prime Minister?


1565
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:57.853
Is there a problem?

1566
01:40:58.895 --> 01:41:00.353
Problems are many, Sam.

1567
01:41:03.103 --> 01:41:04.645
Well, you always have

1568
01:41:04.853 --> 01:41:06.686
this shoulder to cry on...

1569
01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:09.478
And what if I tell you

1570
01:41:09.686 --> 01:41:11.853
that you are my problem?

1571
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:13.353
Me?

1572
01:41:14.103 --> 01:41:15.311
What have I done?

1573
01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.270
You haven't done
anything yet...


1574
01:41:17.561 --> 01:41:19.603
But do you intend to?

1575
01:41:20.561 --> 01:41:21.686
As in?

1576
01:41:22.978 --> 01:41:24.311
As in, a Coup...

1577
01:41:24.561 --> 01:41:25.645
Martial Law?

1578
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:28.103
Like what's happening
around us...


1579
01:41:30.186 --> 01:41:31.645
What do you think?

1580
01:41:33.436 --> 01:41:34.561
You can't.

1581
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:36.353
I can't,

1582
01:41:36.478 --> 01:41:37.895
or I won't?

1583
01:41:39.103 --> 01:41:41.561
There's a difference in
capability and intent,


1584
01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:42.936
Prime Minister.

1585
01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:47.186
I have no interest
in politics.


1586
01:41:47.811 --> 01:41:49.936
The Army is my life.

1587
01:42:01.728 --> 01:42:03.353
There's a nursery rhyme:

1588
01:42:04.895 --> 01:42:06.395
'You mind your own business,

1589
01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.978
I'll mind mine.

1590
01:42:08.561 --> 01:42:10.353
You kiss your own sweetheart,

1591
01:42:10.686 --> 01:42:11.895
I'll kiss mine.'

1592
01:42:16.395 --> 01:42:17.353
Prime Minister.

1593
01:42:18.186 --> 01:42:18.978
Sam...

1594
01:42:20.936 --> 01:42:22.436
I'm sure you understand

1595
01:42:22.686 --> 01:42:24.228
why I was worried.

1596
01:42:30.145 --> 01:42:31.895
Despite the landslide win
of the Awami League


1597
01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.186
and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,

1598
01:42:33.436 --> 01:42:34.603
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto

1599
01:42:34.728 --> 01:42:37.228
has boycotted the Assembly.

1600
01:42:38.061 --> 01:42:39.436
If you want to give

1601
01:42:39.645 --> 01:42:41.520
equal rights as a Pakistani

1602
01:42:41.853 --> 01:42:44.478
then you have to give Bengal

1603
01:42:44.770 --> 01:42:45.770
their right to live...

1604
01:42:46.228 --> 01:42:47.561
because they have been exploited

1605
01:42:47.686 --> 01:42:50.436
for a long, long 23 years...

1606
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:52.895
It cannot be
tolerated anymore.


1607
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:55.061
There seems to be
no end in sight


1608
01:42:55.145 --> 01:42:56.978
for Pakistan's political woes.

1609
01:42:57.145 --> 01:42:58.561
Let me warn you

1610
01:42:58.686 --> 01:42:59.811
and I warn the world

1611
01:42:59.936 --> 01:43:01.145
that this will mean war!

1612
01:43:01.686 --> 01:43:03.478
I'm saying it clearly!

1613
01:43:04.353 --> 01:43:06.228
This time, the fight

1614
01:43:06.853 --> 01:43:09.061
is for our liberation!

1615
01:43:09.478 --> 01:43:11.103
This time, the fight

1616
01:43:11.645 --> 01:43:13.270
is for our Independence!

1617
01:43:14.311 --> 01:43:15.436
Remember!

1618
01:43:15.561 --> 01:43:17.145
I have given my blood.

1619
01:43:17.311 --> 01:43:18.811
And I will give
my blood again.


1620
01:43:18.978 --> 01:43:22.020
I will liberate the people
of my country!


1621
01:43:35.478 --> 01:43:36.436
Tonight.

1622
01:43:45.978 --> 01:43:47.728
Your country, my country...

1623
01:43:47.811 --> 01:43:49.770
Bangladesh! Bangladesh!

1624
01:43:49.895 --> 01:43:51.728
Brave Bengalis take to arms...

1625
01:43:51.853 --> 01:43:53.561
Liberate Bangladesh!

1626
01:43:53.895 --> 01:43:55.603
Brave Bengalis take to arms...

1627
01:43:55.686 --> 01:43:57.395
Liberate Bangladesh!

1628
01:43:57.645 --> 01:43:59.228
Free it! Liberate it!

1629
01:43:59.603 --> 01:44:00.728
Liberate Bangladesh!

1630
01:46:10.936 --> 01:46:12.270
Please! Please!

1631
01:46:31.811 --> 01:46:32.853
The Butcher.

1632
01:46:34.436 --> 01:46:36.978
Tikka was known as
'The Butcher' in IMA.


1633
01:46:37.645 --> 01:46:40.020
In '69, after brutally crushing

1634
01:46:40.145 --> 01:46:42.645
the Balochi movement,
he became


1635
01:46:42.895 --> 01:46:44.978
'The Butcher of Balochistan'.

1636
01:46:46.103 --> 01:46:49.311
And now, after the operation
at Dacca University,


1637
01:46:49.395 --> 01:46:52.228
I guess he's become
'The Butcher of Bengal'.


1638
01:46:53.103 --> 01:46:54.353
This butcher

1639
01:46:54.603 --> 01:46:57.061
has murdered hundreds
of people, Sam...


1640
01:46:57.895 --> 01:46:59.395
Do you know what
he's been doing


1641
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.686
in East Pakistan?

1642
01:47:02.145 --> 01:47:03.936
His soldiers are making people

1643
01:47:04.061 --> 01:47:06.186
dig their own graves
before killing them.


1644
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:09.228
3 million refugees

1645
01:47:09.353 --> 01:47:12.270
have entered India from
East Pakistan till now.


1646
01:47:15.603 --> 01:47:17.561
Bengal, Assam and Tripura...

1647
01:47:17.811 --> 01:47:20.103
I'm getting telegrams from
Chief Ministers of every state.


1648
01:47:21.645 --> 01:47:24.228
You will have to enter
East Pakistan, Sam.


1649
01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:30.311
That would mean war...

1650
01:47:32.395 --> 01:47:33.728
Then so be it.

1651
01:47:35.061 --> 01:47:37.228
Are you ready for war?

1652
01:47:38.145 --> 01:47:39.728
Because I am not.

1653
01:47:44.561 --> 01:47:46.270
Please agree, Mr Shyam.

1654
01:47:51.311 --> 01:47:52.978
April is coming to an end.

1655
01:47:54.145 --> 01:47:56.395
The snow will start melting
in the Himalayan passes


1656
01:47:56.561 --> 01:47:59.103
and open the way
for the Chinese forces.


1657
01:47:59.811 --> 01:48:02.228
In East Pakistan, the Monsoon
is about to arrive.


1658
01:48:02.478 --> 01:48:03.478
With snow melting above

1659
01:48:03.603 --> 01:48:04.853
and the rains below,

1660
01:48:05.103 --> 01:48:06.561
the movement of our forces

1661
01:48:06.686 --> 01:48:07.478
will be restricted

1662
01:48:07.603 --> 01:48:09.686
and they won't get
Air support either.


1663
01:48:10.978 --> 01:48:12.061
The result will be the same

1664
01:48:12.186 --> 01:48:14.811
as it was in 1962,
Defense Minister.


1665
01:48:15.728 --> 01:48:17.020
You may not have a problem

1666
01:48:17.311 --> 01:48:19.270
with being in such a position,

1667
01:48:19.395 --> 01:48:21.103
but I certainly do.

1668
01:48:23.603 --> 01:48:25.436
I don't want to lose.

1669
01:48:28.561 --> 01:48:31.311
But we'll do as you say,

1670
01:48:31.478 --> 01:48:32.728
Prime Minister...

1671
01:48:34.603 --> 01:48:36.311
Now give me your orders.

1672
01:48:43.311 --> 01:48:44.895
Let's reassemble at 4.

1673
01:48:53.145 --> 01:48:54.103
Chief...

1674
01:48:55.103 --> 01:48:56.478
Please stay back.

1675
01:48:58.895 --> 01:49:01.436
Prime Minister, before
you say anything further,


1676
01:49:01.561 --> 01:49:03.186
I have a question for you:

1677
01:49:03.936 --> 01:49:05.728
Shall I hand in my
resignation now,


1678
01:49:05.853 --> 01:49:07.228
or tomorrow morning?

1679
01:49:08.395 --> 01:49:09.936
What you just told us,

1680
01:49:10.228 --> 01:49:11.186
is it true?

1681
01:49:11.311 --> 01:49:13.770
Telling you the truth
is my duty.


1682
01:49:15.103 --> 01:49:17.436
Fighting wars is my job,
Prime Minister...


1683
01:49:17.561 --> 01:49:19.478
And I fight to win.

1684
01:49:24.895 --> 01:49:26.228
Prepare for war.

1685
01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:28.728
Only preparation...

1686
01:49:29.061 --> 01:49:30.186
No immediate action.

1687
01:49:44.436 --> 01:49:46.478
The war will begin
on this day.


1688
01:49:48.353 --> 01:49:49.936
Whether we start it,

1689
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:51.145
or them.

1690
01:49:56.103 --> 01:49:59.020
The refugees pose
a human problem


1691
01:49:59.811 --> 01:50:01.353
and it has to be settled

1692
01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.811
on that basis.

1693
01:50:04.228 --> 01:50:05.728
At the same time,

1694
01:50:10.228 --> 01:50:12.436
the problem of our
relations with India


1695
01:50:12.811 --> 01:50:14.353
is a major factor.

1696
01:50:19.436 --> 01:50:21.478
Any initiative, Mr. President,

1697
01:50:22.936 --> 01:50:25.186
that you might find
possible to take


1698
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:27.603
in solving the problem

1699
01:50:27.728 --> 01:50:29.436
and other related issues

1700
01:50:30.353 --> 01:50:31.936
would be an act of

1701
01:50:32.686 --> 01:50:34.520
historical significance.

1702
01:50:36.686 --> 01:50:38.395
Send it to President Nixon.

1703
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:53.311
The phone, again.

1704
01:50:53.645 --> 01:50:55.103
Must be her again.

1705
01:51:02.228 --> 01:51:03.311
What are you doing, Sam?

1706
01:51:05.228 --> 01:51:06.436
Breakfast, Prime Minister.

1707
01:51:08.811 --> 01:51:11.020
Have breakfast with me today...

1708
01:51:12.228 --> 01:51:13.145
By the way...

1709
01:51:13.311 --> 01:51:14.145
What are you wearing?

1710
01:51:15.311 --> 01:51:16.895
I beg your pardon,
Prime Minister?


1711
01:51:19.645 --> 01:51:21.311
In full uniform, now!

1712
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:23.020
Prime Minister.

1713
01:51:29.353 --> 01:51:30.603
Mr Kissinger,

1714
01:51:31.145 --> 01:51:32.311
Ambassador Keating...

1715
01:51:32.978 --> 01:51:34.395
General Manekshaw.

1716
01:51:37.061 --> 01:51:38.603
President Nixon has
received a letter


1717
01:51:38.728 --> 01:51:39.853
from President Yahya Khan

1718
01:51:39.978 --> 01:51:42.478
that makes his intent
very clear


1719
01:51:42.936 --> 01:51:44.311
about East Pakistan.

1720
01:51:45.103 --> 01:51:46.770
You know Mr Kissinger,

1721
01:51:47.478 --> 01:51:49.686
there is this boy
in Rajiv's class,


1722
01:51:50.311 --> 01:51:52.228
who thinks it is
his business


1723
01:51:52.561 --> 01:51:53.395
to stick his nose

1724
01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:55.311
into everyone else's business.

1725
01:51:56.728 --> 01:51:58.145
But instead of going around

1726
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:59.645
asking for help,

1727
01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:01.395
I told Rajiv

1728
01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.561
to sort it out directly
with the bully.


1729
01:52:05.353 --> 01:52:06.811
Please ask President Nixon

1730
01:52:06.936 --> 01:52:08.895
to restrain the powers
in Pakistan


1731
01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.353
with regard to this matter.

1732
01:52:10.978 --> 01:52:12.853
I am sorry, Madam...

1733
01:52:13.311 --> 01:52:14.603
but neither President Nixon

1734
01:52:14.728 --> 01:52:16.186
nor I can do anything
in this matter.


1735
01:52:17.103 --> 01:52:18.561
This is a ridiculous situation.

1736
01:52:20.936 --> 01:52:22.228
You can't go to war

1737
01:52:22.353 --> 01:52:23.561
over a few refugees.

1738
01:52:24.103 --> 01:52:25.895
The number is 7 million,

1739
01:52:26.145 --> 01:52:27.395
Mr Kissinger.

1740
01:52:27.603 --> 01:52:30.103
I know this is a tough situation,
Mrs Gandhi....


1741
01:52:30.603 --> 01:52:33.103
but the global repercussions

1742
01:52:33.436 --> 01:52:34.936
of any hostile action

1743
01:52:35.478 --> 01:52:36.728
taken by India,

1744
01:52:37.478 --> 01:52:38.520
will be...

1745
01:52:40.311 --> 01:52:41.395
tremendous.

1746
01:52:47.145 --> 01:52:48.603
What do you plan to do?

1747
01:52:48.811 --> 01:52:50.353
I have no other option...

1748
01:52:52.853 --> 01:52:54.395
I will turn to
General Manekshaw.


1749
01:52:57.728 --> 01:52:58.895
I would suggest

1750
01:52:59.061 --> 01:53:00.978
that you insist
upon Pakistan


1751
01:53:01.311 --> 01:53:02.645
to make conditions right

1752
01:53:02.770 --> 01:53:04.645
for those 7 million refugees

1753
01:53:05.478 --> 01:53:07.103
to go back
to their country.


1754
01:53:08.436 --> 01:53:09.645
If you don't...

1755
01:53:11.895 --> 01:53:12.603
He will.

1756
01:53:30.478 --> 01:53:32.186
Well played, Prime Minister.

1757
01:53:34.936 --> 01:53:36.770
"Our borders beckon"

1758
01:53:37.478 --> 01:53:39.395
"From the frontiers"

1759
01:53:40.061 --> 01:53:41.853
"we will call"

1760
01:53:42.145 --> 01:53:44.728
"Hail Mother India!"

1761
01:53:44.978 --> 01:53:46.186
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1762
01:53:46.311 --> 01:53:47.811
"the glory of my country..."

1763
01:53:47.895 --> 01:53:50.270
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1764
01:54:00.061 --> 01:54:01.270
"Our borders beckon"

1765
01:54:01.395 --> 01:54:02.478
"From the frontiers"

1766
01:54:02.603 --> 01:54:03.811
"we will call"

1767
01:54:04.145 --> 01:54:05.145
Doing well, Kalkat!

1768
01:54:05.395 --> 01:54:06.228
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1769
01:54:06.353 --> 01:54:07.436
"the glory of my country..."

1770
01:54:07.561 --> 01:54:09.603
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1771
01:54:20.103 --> 01:54:23.686
"We soar like the rising sun"

1772
01:54:25.103 --> 01:54:28.728
"Crumble mountains
in our wake"


1773
01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:32.395
"In our beating hearts"

1774
01:54:32.603 --> 01:54:34.811
"a storm rages away..."

1775
01:54:35.061 --> 01:54:37.478
"There's a fervour in our frenzy...
We conquer the fray!"


1776
01:54:37.603 --> 01:54:38.978
- Jai Hind, Sir!
- Jai Hind!


1777
01:54:40.103 --> 01:54:42.853
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"


1778
01:54:45.061 --> 01:54:47.395
"Stop for none,
submit to none"


1779
01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.103
"We march on!"

1780
01:54:50.061 --> 01:54:53.520
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"


1781
01:54:55.061 --> 01:54:56.561
"Together as one..."

1782
01:54:56.686 --> 01:54:59.061
"United, we march on!"

1783
01:55:00.436 --> 01:55:02.561
Always remember,
we're soldiers...


1784
01:55:03.478 --> 01:55:04.311
Not thieves.

1785
01:55:04.978 --> 01:55:07.395
During war,
eye only the enemy.


1786
01:55:07.645 --> 01:55:09.853
Not anyone's money
or belongings!


1787
01:55:15.353 --> 01:55:17.478
I am the son of Garuda,
say O my friend!


1788
01:55:17.895 --> 01:55:19.603
Sacrifice Supreme Duty!

1789
01:55:20.353 --> 01:55:22.603
The Jat is strong!
Victory to God!


1790
01:55:22.853 --> 01:55:24.853
Ever powerful!

1791
01:55:25.311 --> 01:55:27.145
Hail Goddess Kali!

1792
01:55:27.561 --> 01:55:29.311
Here come the Gorkhas!

1793
01:55:30.103 --> 01:55:33.770
"With raging rivers we flow"

1794
01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:38.728
"Ever watchful in our way"

1795
01:55:40.061 --> 01:55:42.353
"The will is unbendable"

1796
01:55:42.561 --> 01:55:44.520
"Every duty is obeyed"

1797
01:55:45.103 --> 01:55:48.311
"There's a fervour in our frenzy...
We conquer the fray!"


1798
01:55:49.061 --> 01:55:50.228
Rhino Charge!

1799
01:55:50.686 --> 01:55:52.936
The Battalions need equipment, Chief.

1800
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.936
It's time for Air support.

1801
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:57.395
"Stop for none,
submit to none"


1802
01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:59.270
"We march on!"

1803
01:56:00.311 --> 01:56:01.853
No soldier of mine

1804
01:56:02.145 --> 01:56:04.228
will ever touch a woman.

1805
01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:07.186
Before soldiers,
we're gentlemen...


1806
01:56:08.728 --> 01:56:10.020
When you see a Begum,

1807
01:56:10.353 --> 01:56:12.186
put your hands
in your pockets,


1808
01:56:12.895 --> 01:56:14.353
and think about Sam!

1809
01:56:15.353 --> 01:56:17.061
Brave Madrasi!

1810
01:56:17.853 --> 01:56:19.603
Hit and kill!

1811
01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:23.978
Say victory to King Shivaji Maharaj!

1812
01:56:29.728 --> 01:56:32.186
Victory to the Great Lord Badri Nath!

1813
01:56:32.561 --> 01:56:34.853
Victory to Birsa Munda!

1814
01:56:35.061 --> 01:56:37.270
Victory to Lord Hanuman!

1815
01:56:37.603 --> 01:56:39.770
Victory to King Ramachandra!

1816
01:56:40.061 --> 01:56:42.061
Say victory to India!

1817
01:56:42.936 --> 01:56:45.145
He who says 'God is truth'...

1818
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:47.061
Is ever blessed!

1819
01:56:47.811 --> 01:56:49.311
Blackout drills will begin soon.

1820
01:56:49.436 --> 01:56:51.103
Our radars too,
are operational now.


1821
01:56:51.228 --> 01:56:52.811
I can assure complete
Air superiority


1822
01:56:52.936 --> 01:56:54.728
over East Pakistan
in a few days.


1823
01:56:55.353 --> 01:56:58.103
Our Western and Eastern fleets
are absolutely ready.


1824
01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:00.561
We'll target Karachi
in the West,


1825
01:57:00.853 --> 01:57:02.728
and the Eastern fleet
along with INS Vikrant


1826
01:57:02.853 --> 01:57:05.520
will make the East Pakistan
seaboard in-operational.


1827
01:57:06.311 --> 01:57:07.478
"Our borders beckon"

1828
01:57:07.603 --> 01:57:08.853
"From the frontiers"

1829
01:57:08.936 --> 01:57:10.895
"we will call"

1830
01:57:11.228 --> 01:57:13.061
Intelligence reports
are up to date.


1831
01:57:13.353 --> 01:57:15.061
Our network is
stronger than before.


1832
01:57:16.270 --> 01:57:17.436
"Our borders beckon"

1833
01:57:17.561 --> 01:57:18.728
"From the frontiers"

1834
01:57:18.811 --> 01:57:20.603
"we will call"

1835
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:22.353
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1836
01:57:22.478 --> 01:57:23.978
"the glory of my country..."

1837
01:57:24.103 --> 01:57:26.061
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1838
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:28.436
Victory to Goddess Kali!

1839
01:57:28.853 --> 01:57:30.853
Victory to Goddess Jwala!

1840
01:57:31.228 --> 01:57:33.145
Victory to Goddess Durga!

1841
01:57:33.811 --> 01:57:35.978
Victory to Mother India!

1842
01:57:36.353 --> 01:57:39.811
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"


1843
01:57:41.311 --> 01:57:43.561
"Stop for none,
submit to none"


1844
01:57:43.811 --> 01:57:45.353
"We march on!"

1845
01:57:46.311 --> 01:57:48.645
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"


1846
01:57:51.311 --> 01:57:52.645
"Together as one..."

1847
01:57:52.770 --> 01:57:54.645
"United, we march on!"

1848
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:59.561
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"


1849
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:03.645
"Stop for none,
submit to none"


1850
01:58:03.770 --> 01:58:04.853
"We march on!"

1851
01:58:04.978 --> 01:58:08.478
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on!"


1852
01:58:08.895 --> 01:58:11.270
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on!"


1853
01:58:30.686 --> 01:58:31.603
Today...

1854
01:58:33.145 --> 01:58:35.395
I've come here
to meet all of you...


1855
01:58:37.478 --> 01:58:39.853
To salute all of you.

1856
01:58:43.061 --> 01:58:44.478
At the end of the war,

1857
01:58:45.978 --> 01:58:47.728
some of you

1858
01:58:48.686 --> 01:58:49.853
may not be here...

1859
01:58:52.853 --> 01:58:55.061
Whether we survive
or we perish...


1860
01:58:57.228 --> 01:58:58.978
the pride of our uniform

1861
01:58:59.061 --> 01:59:00.770
shall live on forever!

1862
01:59:06.561 --> 01:59:07.728
This refugee situation

1863
01:59:07.853 --> 01:59:09.061
is out of control.

1864
01:59:09.603 --> 01:59:11.020
But we shouldn't
be the ones


1865
01:59:11.145 --> 01:59:12.145
to start the war.

1866
01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:14.645
We won't have to.

1867
01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:16.353
I know Yahya well.

1868
01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:18.436
He reacts with emotion,

1869
01:59:18.811 --> 01:59:19.811
not intellect.

1870
01:59:20.603 --> 01:59:21.770
Prime Minister.

1871
01:59:28.853 --> 01:59:30.561
Are you ready for this, Sam?

1872
01:59:31.728 --> 01:59:33.436
I'm always ready, sweetie.

1873
01:59:40.603 --> 01:59:42.145
Our enemy

1874
01:59:42.811 --> 01:59:45.895
has provoked us
yet again.


1875
01:59:47.603 --> 01:59:49.478
We've tolerated enough.

1876
01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:51.811
Now,

1877
01:59:52.478 --> 01:59:54.478
the time has come

1878
01:59:55.228 --> 01:59:56.978
to give the enemy

1879
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:59.353
a crushing response.

1880
02:00:36.645 --> 02:00:38.853
Pakistan has attacked
our Airfields!


1881
02:00:43.353 --> 02:00:44.228
Tell me.

1882
02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:45.353
Amritsar...

1883
02:00:46.353 --> 02:00:47.478
Pathankot...

1884
02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:49.020
Avantipur...

1885
02:00:49.311 --> 02:00:50.186
Srinagar...

1886
02:00:50.811 --> 02:00:51.770
Uttarlai...

1887
02:00:52.478 --> 02:00:53.395
Ambala...

1888
02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:55.186
Jodhpur...

1889
02:00:55.603 --> 02:00:56.686
and Agra.

1890
02:00:59.353 --> 02:01:01.186
This is the day we've
been preparing for.


1891
02:01:01.353 --> 02:01:03.311
Gentlemen, let's get them.

1892
02:01:08.603 --> 02:01:09.478
What happened?

1893
02:01:09.686 --> 02:01:10.520
Are you OK?

1894
02:01:10.645 --> 02:01:11.395
No...

1895
02:01:11.936 --> 02:01:12.811
Actually...

1896
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:14.895
I came running, so...

1897
02:01:15.978 --> 02:01:17.061
Why running?

1898
02:01:17.645 --> 02:01:19.686
Because General Candeth
had to call me.


1899
02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:23.395
You all prepared fully
for the war...


1900
02:01:24.186 --> 02:01:25.645
but no one remembered

1901
02:01:25.770 --> 02:01:27.186
to put a phone
in this room!


1902
02:01:36.895 --> 02:01:38.978
The people of East Bengal

1903
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:41.145
are sacrificing their blood

1904
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:43.353
for their freedom.

1905
02:01:44.311 --> 02:01:45.978
At this difficult hour,

1906
02:01:46.353 --> 02:01:48.770
all citizens of our country

1907
02:01:49.228 --> 02:01:52.811
must stand united
to face all hardships


1908
02:01:54.728 --> 02:01:56.603
and dangers ahead of us.

1909
02:01:58.061 --> 02:02:00.895
India stands in
complete solidarity


1910
02:02:01.395 --> 02:02:04.436
with our Bengali
sisters and brothers.


1911
02:02:04.936 --> 02:02:08.270
We salute their
immense courage!


1912
02:02:08.770 --> 02:02:10.520
Joy Bangla!

1913
02:02:10.686 --> 02:02:12.228
Joy Bangla!

1914
02:02:12.311 --> 02:02:13.936
Joy Bangabandhu!

1915
02:02:14.061 --> 02:02:16.020
Joy Bangabandhu!

1916
02:02:16.228 --> 02:02:17.978
And remember!
Pakistan must never


1917
02:02:18.103 --> 02:02:19.436
forget this war!

1918
02:02:20.311 --> 02:02:22.520
Also get me the Eastern and
Western Army Commanders


1919
02:02:22.645 --> 02:02:24.311
on the line immediately.

1920
02:02:26.561 --> 02:02:28.020
Sir, Admiral Nanda
and Air Chief Lal


1921
02:02:28.145 --> 02:02:29.228
shall meet you
in half an hour.


1922
02:02:29.353 --> 02:02:30.520
Is that alright?

1923
02:02:34.603 --> 02:02:35.395
Sir?

1924
02:02:35.645 --> 02:02:36.436
Yes?

1925
02:02:36.811 --> 02:02:37.603
Yes.

1926
02:02:40.561 --> 02:02:41.978
Sam was right.

1927
02:02:43.353 --> 02:02:45.145
Yahya will not be
able to resist.


1928
02:02:55.561 --> 02:02:57.395
Madam, may I ask you
something?


1929
02:02:58.186 --> 02:02:59.645
In the middle
of your speech,


1930
02:02:59.728 --> 02:03:01.270
you got news of
Pakistan's attack.


1931
02:03:02.395 --> 02:03:04.978
But your face didn't
as much as twitch.


1932
02:03:05.686 --> 02:03:07.936
And you're smiling
even now.


1933
02:03:23.395 --> 02:03:25.061
Sam had written down...

1934
02:03:27.103 --> 02:03:28.270
when the war will begin.

1935
02:03:33.061 --> 02:03:33.978
Tonight.

1936
02:03:39.061 --> 02:03:40.186
"Our borders beckon"

1937
02:03:40.311 --> 02:03:41.478
"From the frontiers"

1938
02:03:41.603 --> 02:03:43.561
"we will call"

1939
02:03:44.061 --> 02:03:45.228
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1940
02:03:45.353 --> 02:03:46.436
"the glory of my country..."

1941
02:03:46.561 --> 02:03:47.561
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1942
02:03:47.686 --> 02:03:50.353
In the Eastern sector
all three Indian Armed Forces


1943
02:03:50.478 --> 02:03:51.728
along with the Mukti Bahini

1944
02:03:51.853 --> 02:03:53.978
launched attacks on
Sylhet and Chittagong.


1945
02:03:56.895 --> 02:03:58.895
In the Western region,
the Indian Air Force


1946
02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:01.561
bombed 13 Pakistani airfields.

1947
02:04:04.853 --> 02:04:08.811
Battles continue in Uri, Poonch,
Shakkargarh and Chhamb.


1948
02:04:14.311 --> 02:04:15.686
Our troops are under pressure

1949
02:04:15.811 --> 02:04:17.061
in Chhamb, Pratap.

1950
02:04:17.603 --> 02:04:18.811
We need to divert

1951
02:04:18.936 --> 02:04:20.895
Air resources for
ground support.


1952
02:04:21.311 --> 02:04:22.978
But our Air Force is busy

1953
02:04:23.103 --> 02:04:24.728
attacking Pakistani airfields.

1954
02:04:24.978 --> 02:04:27.228
I've already diverted
Air support, there Sam!


1955
02:04:27.936 --> 02:04:28.936
For heaven's sake,

1956
02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:30.478
leave the Air battle to me!

1957
02:04:31.603 --> 02:04:33.978
It's crucial that we damage
Pakistani airfields,


1958
02:04:34.353 --> 02:04:35.811
or their aircrafts will continue

1959
02:04:35.936 --> 02:04:37.103
to attack your troops!

1960
02:04:47.311 --> 02:04:49.145
In Sylhet, the Indian Army

1961
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:51.603
defeated the Pakistani forces,

1962
02:04:51.728 --> 02:04:54.186
deploying a Helicopter
attack for the first time.


1963
02:04:54.728 --> 02:04:56.145
Pakistan has sunk

1964
02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:58.228
the Indian warship,
INS Khukri.


1965
02:04:58.603 --> 02:05:00.895
The bombing of Chittagong port

1966
02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.936
by the Indian Air Force
along with INS Vikrant


1967
02:05:03.061 --> 02:05:04.436
has enforced an
effective blockade


1968
02:05:04.561 --> 02:05:05.770
in the Bay of Bengal.

1969
02:05:07.145 --> 02:05:08.686
We lost INS Khukri

1970
02:05:08.770 --> 02:05:09.895
35 nautical miles

1971
02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:12.020
south-west of Diu Head,
Prime Minister.


1972
02:05:12.436 --> 02:05:14.603
But with the Navy's
second missile strike,


1973
02:05:14.728 --> 02:05:16.853
Karachi port is still
inoperational.


1974
02:05:17.145 --> 02:05:18.436
And in Longewala,

1975
02:05:18.728 --> 02:05:19.895
after the joint actions

1976
02:05:20.020 --> 02:05:21.061
of the Air Force and Army

1977
02:05:21.186 --> 02:05:22.353
12 Infantry Division

1978
02:05:22.478 --> 02:05:23.395
has cleared the enemy

1979
02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:24.770
from Jaisalmer sector.

1980
02:05:26.811 --> 02:05:29.061
Give me an updated report
at 5, Chief.


1981
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:30.311
Prime Minister.

1982
02:05:31.561 --> 02:05:33.395
What's new in this report?

1983
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:37.020
More stories of our defeat?

1984
02:05:43.853 --> 02:05:45.145
"Our borders beckon"

1985
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:46.311
"From the frontiers"

1986
02:05:46.436 --> 02:05:48.020
"we will call"

1987
02:05:48.936 --> 02:05:50.103
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1988
02:05:50.228 --> 02:05:51.353
"the glory of my country..."

1989
02:05:51.436 --> 02:05:53.395
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1990
02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:59.603
By sea, by air
and on land...


1991
02:05:59.728 --> 02:06:02.186
From all sides,
the Indian Forces


1992
02:06:02.311 --> 02:06:03.770
are now closing in
on Dhaka.


1993
02:06:03.895 --> 02:06:07.561
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"


1994
02:06:08.895 --> 02:06:10.353
"Together as one..."

1995
02:06:10.478 --> 02:06:12.270
"United, we march on!"

1996
02:06:13.936 --> 02:06:16.436
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"


1997
02:06:18.895 --> 02:06:21.270
"Stop for none,
submit to none"


1998
02:06:21.395 --> 02:06:23.186
"We march on!"

1999
02:06:23.936 --> 02:06:25.478
"We march on!"

2000
02:06:38.645 --> 02:06:40.353
The people of this area

2001
02:06:41.103 --> 02:06:42.520
are against you.

2002
02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:46.061
They hate you.

2003
02:06:47.895 --> 02:06:50.520
The Indian Army
has surrounded you.


2004
02:06:51.728 --> 02:06:53.436
The Indian Navy

2005
02:06:53.936 --> 02:06:56.270
has shut down your ports.

2006
02:06:57.103 --> 02:06:59.770
Your Air Force has
been destroyed


2007
02:06:59.853 --> 02:07:01.311
in East Pakistan.

2008
02:07:02.103 --> 02:07:04.603
The Mukti Bahini
and people of Bengal


2009
02:07:04.811 --> 02:07:06.228
are ready to take revenge

2010
02:07:06.353 --> 02:07:08.020
for your crimes.

2011
02:07:09.436 --> 02:07:11.478
Why do you want to
waste your lives?


2012
02:07:11.728 --> 02:07:14.145
Don't you want
to return home,


2013
02:07:14.436 --> 02:07:17.353
to your family,
to your children?


2014
02:07:17.978 --> 02:07:19.603
Don't waste any more time.

2015
02:07:19.936 --> 02:07:22.353
There's no shame
in putting down arms


2016
02:07:22.478 --> 02:07:24.270
in front of a fellow soldier.

2017
02:07:27.895 --> 02:07:29.895
This is the Indian Army's promise:

2018
02:07:30.561 --> 02:07:31.978
You will be accorded

2019
02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:34.103
the respect

2020
02:07:35.228 --> 02:07:36.728
that befits a soldier.

2021
02:07:39.103 --> 02:07:40.853
This is the Indian Army's promise:

2022
02:07:41.103 --> 02:07:42.520
You will be accorded

2023
02:07:42.853 --> 02:07:44.228
the respect

2024
02:07:44.603 --> 02:07:46.186
that befits a soldier.

2025
02:07:48.936 --> 02:07:50.895
Pakistan has transmitted

2026
02:07:51.020 --> 02:07:53.228
a surrender proposal, gentlemen!

2027
02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:11.145
Victory to Mother India!

2028
02:08:11.978 --> 02:08:13.936
The Indian Army's
onslaught continues


2029
02:08:14.061 --> 02:08:15.145
on the Western front.

2030
02:08:15.270 --> 02:08:16.603
On the Eastern front,

2031
02:08:16.728 --> 02:08:19.520
Pakistan's defeat
seems certain.


2032
02:08:24.936 --> 02:08:27.186
So what if the whole of
East Pakistan falls?


2033
02:08:27.436 --> 02:08:28.853
In the UN Security
Council meeting


2034
02:08:28.978 --> 02:08:30.645
held at Pakistan's request,

2035
02:08:30.770 --> 02:08:33.770
Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto


2036
02:08:33.936 --> 02:08:36.395
put forth his stance
on the issue of ceasefire.


2037
02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:37.311
We will fight.

2038
02:08:37.436 --> 02:08:38.395
We will go back and fight.

2039
02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:40.895
I will not be a party

2040
02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:43.770
to the ignominious surrender
of a part of my country.


2041
02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:45.520
You can take your
Security Council!


2042
02:08:45.645 --> 02:08:47.228
Here you are!
I am going!


2043
02:08:53.728 --> 02:08:55.145
I don't agree, 
Prime Minister.

2044
02:08:57.061 --> 02:08:59.311
It was wrong of us
to put the Indian Army


2045
02:08:59.436 --> 02:09:01.728
in a defensive position
on the Western front.


2046
02:09:02.061 --> 02:09:03.728
Now to suddenly
halt action there,


2047
02:09:03.853 --> 02:09:05.561
without giving our forces
a proper chance...


2048
02:09:05.686 --> 02:09:08.061
This is just unfair,
Prime Minister.


2049
02:09:10.936 --> 02:09:12.103
It has to be done, Sam.

2050
02:09:14.061 --> 02:09:15.061
Go to Dhaka tomorrow

2051
02:09:15.186 --> 02:09:16.603
and collect the surrender papers.

2052
02:09:18.686 --> 02:09:20.186
Aurora should go.

2053
02:09:21.478 --> 02:09:22.520
Are you sure?

2054
02:10:04.145 --> 02:10:05.978
All the world admires

2055
02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:08.728
a deed, well done.

2056
02:10:09.478 --> 02:10:10.645
And I think,

2057
02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:12.603
with all modesty

2058
02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:13.978
we can say

2059
02:10:14.103 --> 02:10:15.353
that we have done

2060
02:10:15.561 --> 02:10:16.645
this action

2061
02:10:17.061 --> 02:10:17.853
well!

2062
02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:55.728
And Madam wants
this gentleman


2063
02:10:55.853 --> 02:10:56.978
to become the Field Marshal!

2064
02:10:57.145 --> 02:10:59.061
India will never have

2065
02:10:59.186 --> 02:11:01.186
the post of Field Marshal.

2066
02:11:04.020 --> 02:11:07.436
I sent a proposal to
make you Field Marshal...


2067
02:11:08.228 --> 02:11:10.020
And you go and do this?

2068
02:11:10.645 --> 02:11:12.686
'Pakistan would've won the war

2069
02:11:12.811 --> 02:11:14.770
if I was their Army Chief.'

2070
02:11:15.603 --> 02:11:17.103
Really, Chief?

2071
02:11:17.895 --> 02:11:19.145
It was a joke.

2072
02:11:20.228 --> 02:11:21.728
I also said that

2073
02:11:21.853 --> 02:11:24.520
Yahya didn't pay me
for my bike,


2074
02:11:24.936 --> 02:11:27.270
so I took half
his country away.


2075
02:11:32.020 --> 02:11:35.395
London is my favourite
city in Europe...


2076
02:11:36.020 --> 02:11:37.978
They forgot to write 'Europe'.

2077
02:11:39.561 --> 02:11:42.686
You know me, Prime Minister.

2078
02:11:45.853 --> 02:11:47.478
We soldiers can fight enemies

2079
02:11:47.603 --> 02:11:49.270
from outside the country,

2080
02:11:49.561 --> 02:11:51.520
we can defend ourselves.

2081
02:11:52.353 --> 02:11:54.603
But not with those
within our country...


2082
02:11:56.645 --> 02:11:59.603
Here, it's your duty

2083
02:12:00.603 --> 02:12:02.020
to fight for us,

2084
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:03.853
Madam Prime Minister.

2085
02:12:30.645 --> 02:12:31.520
Sam...

2086
02:12:32.561 --> 02:12:33.603
Retirement?

2087
02:13:07.811 --> 02:13:08.728
Oh yes,

2088
02:13:08.853 --> 02:13:10.811
I am both delighted
and proud


2089
02:13:10.936 --> 02:13:12.645
to be promoted
as Field Marshal.


2090
02:13:13.061 --> 02:13:14.353
Happy and honoured!

2091
02:13:16.228 --> 02:13:17.561
Will that be all?

2092
02:13:18.978 --> 02:13:20.186
Just a few photos, Sir.

2093
02:13:20.311 --> 02:13:22.603
But... I'm not even ready!

2094
02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:25.311
You look beautiful, Silloo.

2095
02:13:25.603 --> 02:13:26.686
Always.

2096
02:13:30.311 --> 02:13:32.186
Any special plans tonight,
Field Marshal?


2097
02:13:32.645 --> 02:13:34.020
It's New Year's Eve.

2098
02:13:34.770 --> 02:13:37.061
Tonight, my wife and I...

2099
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:38.978
we will go places.

2100
02:13:40.728 --> 02:13:42.853
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Field Marshal.


2101
02:13:48.228 --> 02:13:50.436
Great timing for your promotion...

2102
02:13:51.436 --> 02:13:53.561
Just 15 days before retirement!

2103
02:14:03.770 --> 02:14:05.395
"Doesn't slow down"

2104
02:14:05.811 --> 02:14:07.561
"Nor turns around"

2105
02:14:08.186 --> 02:14:10.603
"Just keeps going on..."

2106
02:14:11.978 --> 02:14:15.603
"Not much is heard or said"

2107
02:14:16.436 --> 02:14:19.061
"He believes in soldiering on"

2108
02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:23.895
"History will forever wonder..."

2109
02:14:24.270 --> 02:14:26.561
"What a man he is!"

2110
02:14:28.061 --> 02:14:30.436
"He is God's chosen one..."

2111
02:14:32.145 --> 02:14:34.436
"He is our special one!"

2112
02:14:36.311 --> 02:14:38.853
"He is God's chosen one..."

2113
02:14:40.353 --> 02:14:42.561
"He is our special one!"

2114
02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:56.603
"Every crease on his forehead..."

2115
02:14:57.561 --> 02:14:59.686
"A mark of his destiny"

2116
02:15:01.686 --> 02:15:04.561
"Every word spoken..."

2117
02:15:05.603 --> 02:15:08.103
"Is etched in eternity"

2118
02:15:09.895 --> 02:15:13.270
"History will forever wonder..."

2119
02:15:13.728 --> 02:15:16.145
"What a man he is!"

2120
02:15:17.395 --> 02:15:20.228
"He is God's chosen one..."

2121
02:15:21.561 --> 02:15:24.103
"He is our special one!"

2122
02:15:25.686 --> 02:15:28.478
"He is God's chosen one..."

2123
02:15:29.811 --> 02:15:32.478
"He is our special one!"

2124
02:15:35.561 --> 02:15:36.603
Sir...

2125
02:15:37.186 --> 02:15:39.311
You won't be on duty
from tomorrow...


2126
02:15:39.561 --> 02:15:40.561
It will seem very strange.

2127
02:15:41.728 --> 02:15:43.686
Don't you worry, sweetie...

2128
02:15:44.186 --> 02:15:46.561
A Field Marshal is
always on duty!


2129
02:15:50.978 --> 02:15:54.270
"Life's ups and downs"

2130
02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:57.686
"Each moment lived
with passion"


2131
02:15:59.270 --> 02:16:02.686
"This fierce and fearless soldier"

2132
02:16:03.145 --> 02:16:05.936
"Dedicated to his nation!"

2133
02:16:09.603 --> 02:16:12.853
"There will never be another"

2134
02:16:13.561 --> 02:16:16.270
"Like this wondrous one!"

2135
02:16:17.145 --> 02:16:19.936
"He is God's chosen one..."

2136
02:16:21.186 --> 02:16:23.686
"He is our special one!"
