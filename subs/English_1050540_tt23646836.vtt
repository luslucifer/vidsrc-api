00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.580
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

2
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.420
<i>Give it up for Tom Papa!</i>

3
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.050
Thank you very much.

4
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.130
Look at you.

5
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.760
Look at you, still alive. Good job.

6
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.520
I'm proud of you.

7
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.435
Oh, thank you so much for that.

8
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.560
This is so nice to be here.
We're gonna have a good time, I hope.


9
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.365
They say these are
very exciting times. They are.


10
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.785
Some people say scary times. I disagree.

11
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.995
I think these are very exciting times.

12
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.125
When they're changing all the rules,
we can do anything we want now.


13
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.920
I say, let's kidnap some billionaires.

14
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.715
Why not? We got a lot of problems.
Five guys have all the money.


15
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.890
Let's go get them. 
Who's gonna stop us?

16
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.265
I'm all for you being a billionaire.
Good job.


17
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.475
You worked hard, you changed the world.

18
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.435
You get to be a
billionaire for 24 hours.


19
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.985
You don't start giving that money
away to poor people by morning,


20
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.820
we're coming to get you.

21
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.485
Could you imagine a billion dollars?
I don't even dream like that, do you?


22
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.325
One person, a billion dollars.

23
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.285
No, I used to be bothered by big dreams
and high expectations.


24
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.750
Not anymore.

25
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.375
This is it, guys. This is it.
We're already doing it.


26
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.000
You did it. Good job.

27
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.585
This is it. Really.

28
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.300
For me, a good day is any day I don't
have to retrieve a username and password.


29
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.390
Oh. Oh.

30
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.765
What a great day.

31
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.185
Nothing worse on the planet,
when you're about to have some fun


32
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.360
and you're cock-blocked
by the username and password.


33
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.195
There's nothing worse.

34
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.735
I mean, I know there's wars going on,
and things are on fire, but for us,


35
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.110
for us...

36
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.870
there's nothing worse.

37
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.535
It's not like in the olden times
and fairy tales and storybooks,


38
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.665
when you need a magical password,
go on an adventure,


39
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.705
you get something amazing for it.

40
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.215
You need the password
to get in the gate,


41
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.005
go into the dark forest,
and become friends with a talking crow,


42
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.555
fight a demon with a willow stick,
and you get the password.


43
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.015
And the doors open up,
and a unicorn gives you a ride


44
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.980
to a magical wizard who gives
you gold coins and sexual favors.


45
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.525
We don't get any of that after pouring
our heart and souls into our devices


46
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.035
for three straight hours,
giving away all our family secrets,


47
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.910
our mom's maiden name, and
who she had sex with in high school...


48
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.245
and then we play that "squarey" game
like we're in nursery school.


49
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.790
Is there a stoplight in the square?

50
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.170
Is there a dump truck in the square?
Was that my dead grandma in the square?


51
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.135
They send a bunch of
codes to other emails


52
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.635
you don't have the password for, either.

53
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.725
Then finally you get the password.

54
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.225
Do we get sexual
favors from wizards? No.


55
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.270
What do we get? What do we get? We
get to order on the Pizza Hut app. Yay.


56
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.530
Yay.

57
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.120
If only I had the courage to call
someone on the phone three hours ago...


58
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.700
and place this order.

59
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.710
But I'm scared of people now.

60
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.045
I don't know what that 16-year-old
manager at Pizza Hut


61
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.880
is gonna ask me,
but it's gonna be scary.


62
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.135
No way around it.
We're all being changed,


63
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.685
dragged into the metaverse,
turned into robots as we speak.


64
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.890
Remember you before these devices
as a different person?


65
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.645
You get a glimpse of it when you go
out into the world without your phone.


66
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.935
You ever do that, leave
your phone behind?


67
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.235
By mistake, of course.
You wouldn't do it intentionally.


68
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.485
But just go out
about the day without your phone?


69
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.245
Oh! What a great day.

70
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.700
Once you get past
the crying and the dry heaving and...


71
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.125
tugging on strangers' pant legs,
asking for help.


72
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.295
Once you get through all of that,
it's a magical day.


73
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.675
You just walk around with your
own thoughts, just thinking about stuff.


74
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.050
Wow, this must be what
Benjamin Franklin felt like...


75
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.680
just walking around, thinking about
kites and candies and syphilis.


76
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.945
There's no getting around it.
The world is too easy with it.


77
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.735
Could you imagine traveling
without your phone?


78
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.115
Leaving tomorrow, going to the airport,

79
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.660
getting on a plane and leaving for
three days without your phone?


80
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.165
Terrifying idea.
How did you even get to the airport?


81
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.460
That's a good question.
How did you get to the airport?


82
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.840
Is Uber responding to smoke signals now?

83
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.635
What happens once you're at the airport
and they change your flight or gate?


84
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.255
How are you gonna know?

85
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.265
You're not. You're not gonna know.

86
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.560
You're just gonna wander the halls
of the airport until you die.


87
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.560
You're going to die at the airport
on the floor outside of a Hudson News...


88
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.200
that's filled with things that could
save you if only you had Apple Pay.


89
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.865
That'd be a good ending to the story.

90
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.035
Or would it? What happens if you die,
and you go up to Heaven,


91
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.045
and they're like, "We weren't gonna
let you in, but you did your best."


92
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.965
"You get in. Welcome to Heaven.
Congratulations."


93
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.210
"What's your username and password?"

94
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.090
I don't have it, 
I don't have it.

95
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.895
Remember two years ago, when they
told us we couldn't see our families?


96
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.815
Remember that?
Yeah. Don't do it. Don't go home.


97
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.690
You're gonna kill
your family with your face.


98
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.655
No. No holidays for you,
not this year. You stay home.


99
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.490
You're gonna kill your mom
with your breath.


100
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.120
Two years, no family. Oh, my God.
Those were the good old days.


101
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.885
We all had the same excuse,
we all had the same excuse.


102
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.385
I would love to come home,
but they won't let me.


103
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.100
I'm gonna have to spend Thanksgiving
with my friends and have fun this year.


104
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.935
Oh, man. Families are a blessing.

105
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.275
It is a blessing if you have your family,
but it doesn't make 'em any less annoying.


106
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.655
I just saw my parents. Oh, my God.
They're getting goofy.


107
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.035
My father bought my mother one of those

108
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.325
weapons-grade jackhammer massage guns.

109
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.995
Have you seen these things?

110
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.625
These new torture devices

111
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.995
they're just selling to old people
to try on each other?


112
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.545
No background check,
no licensing, no training of any kind.


113
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.880
My father just aimed it at my
mother's shoulder and hit the trigger.


114
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.095
Wasn't good. Wasn't good.

115
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.140
It just gathered up her skin
like pancake batter.


116
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.990
She couldn't get away.
He couldn't turn it off.


117
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.620
She looked like a Shar Pei
stuck in a car wash.


118
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.915
Yeah, it got the knot out.

119
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.215
It also got her collarbone out
and her shoulder blade.


120
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.920
And all her insides
are on the outside now.


121
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.475
I love them to death. I do. But what
are we doing with our old people?


122
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.765
We should be protecting our old people.

123
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.735
Why are we telling our old people they
can do more things the older they get?


124
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.565
That's not how it works.

125
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.365
You don't add things
to your bucket list after 70.


126
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.740
Anything you don't do by 70,
you don't have to do.


127
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.365
My mother watches TV,
she gets these ideas,


128
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.995
seeing all these active old people,
she comes back,


129
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.665
"Your father and I are
gonna start to travel."


130
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.205
"Your dad and I
are gonna hit the road."


131
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.215
"Time to start traveling."

132
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.420
No.

133
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.630
You're scared of stairs.

134
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.015
This isn't the time
to backpack through Europe.


135
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.810
Your ankles are made of Popsicle sticks.

136
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.645
It takes Dad three tries
to get up the ramp at Starbucks,


137
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.065
just gaining momentum till he
eventually bursts through the door


138
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.900
and forgets where he is.

139
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.030
Starts cursing out the barista
because his car's not ready.


140
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.835
"You don't know.
Your father and I like activities."


141
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.755
"We rent the tandem bike."

142
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.375
"We go to the hotel.
We rent a tandem bike."


143
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.590
Don't.

144
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.430
A tandem bike after 70
should be called a double suicide.


145
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.180
Two people who don't get along
and don't know where they're going,


146
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.810
turning in opposite directions,
should not be on a tandem bike.


147
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.440
You should be in a wagon.

148
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.115
You should be in a wagon,
and we'll tug you around,


149
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.700
you can feed the ducks.

150
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.320
We'll have you home by 4:00,
in time for your programs.


151
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.715
And then they get angry.
They get angry if I try and help them,


152
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.925
and give them advice, and
protect them, they get all defensive.


153
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.475
"Don't tell us what to do.
We're your parents. We made you."


154
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.145
All right. Thank you for inventing me.
That was very nice.


155
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.065
But things have changed.

156
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.070
Things have changed.
My brain's still intact.


157
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.990
I didn't put sponges
in the toaster this morning.


158
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.915
I'm looking forward to the time
when my kids help me out.


159
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.585
I have two teenage daughters.
They help me out now.


160
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.085
I'm grateful for the assistance.
I don't do things right a lot.


161
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.510
They don't have to know
it's because I'm drunk and high.


162
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.930
But I am confused sometimes.

163
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.185
"Dad, should the stove still be on?"

164
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.810
"No."

165
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.310
"No, I made dinner an hour ago."

166
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.030
"That pot's going
to have to soak for a while."


167
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.070
"Fill it with bubbles.
We'll deal with it on Wednesday."


168
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.290
"Dad, that was a stop sign."
"Good thing we're speeding."


169
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.040
"Hold my weed.
I'm gonna make a U-turn."


170
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.500
"Don't tell your mom."

171
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.175
They could be nicer about it, though.

172
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.595
Nothing meaner than a teenage girl
when she comes after you.


173
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.175
Nothing meaner on the planet,
'cause they're smart,


174
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.100
they're cunning, and they just laser
on your weaknesses.


175
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.390
It's very unsettling.

176
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.645
My daughter came into
the kitchen she said,


177
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.355
"Dad, we're trying to watch
a movie in the other room,


178
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.320
and we can hear you breathing."

179
00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.660
"Okay, I'll just stop that."

180
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.075
"I'll just stop breathing and living here,
and living all together. How about that?"


181
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.750
And she just high-fived her sister
and went back to watching <i>The Avengers.</i>


182
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.175
My other daughter, 16,
was just staring me down at breakfast.


183
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.260
Very scary. She hasn't made
eye contact with me since she was six.


184
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.600
"I don't like the way
you chew your granola."


185
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.765
"Why you chewing your granola like
that?" What the hell does that even mean?


186
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.605
It's granola. It's big and it's crunchy.

187
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.690
I have to make it smaller.
Or it's gonna rip apart my trachea.


188
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.370
How do you eat your granola?
You just swallow it whole, like a snake?


189
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.280
Devil child?

190
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.075
This is the same daughter, by the way,

191
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.295
who without my
permission or my knowledge,


192
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.965
during the Troubles,
went out and adopted a rescue pug.


193
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.215
A pug! Did all the paperwork herself
and just showed up with a pug.


194
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.890
If you don't know what a pug is,
they advertise it as a dog.


195
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:41.805
It is not.

196
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.350
It has a fat, round,
hairy, turkey-like body,


197
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.815
four spindly legs that look like
it couldn't support that fat body.


198
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.775
Dogs have paws.

199
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.700
Pugs have long, lady fingers
with fancy press on nails.


200
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.120
Some have four, some have
three, some two. Like a chicken foot.


201
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.710
And the face
of an arthritic 80-year-old man.


202
00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:16.090
Eyes that look like it belongs
on a different animal altogether.


203
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.975
It looks like God was making it,
ran out of pug eyes


204
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.310
and said, "Let's give it cow eyes.
See how that goes."


205
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.645
It doesn't go.

206
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.775
This poor guy's got these two
bulbous things hanging out of his skull.


207
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.940
The lids can't even
get up and over the ball.


208
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.945
He hasn't had his eyes shut
in the time I've had him.


209
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.660
He just struggles
and snores 24 hours a day.


210
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.330
"Is he asleep right
now? We're on a walk."


211
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.930
Fun fact.

212
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:07.730
Fun fact. If a pug falls
in the pool, it sinks immediately.


213
00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.445
Turns out if your head's
made of a concrete block,


214
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.900
you're gonna face plant in the deep end.

215
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:21.030
Still snoring, still snoring.
Bubbles coming up on either side.


216
00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.865
I don't think he
even knows he's in the pool.


217
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.875
Think he thinks he wandered
into a weird part of the yard


218
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.670
and his glaucoma's flaring up.

219
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.425
Best part about him, his name is Frank.

220
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.095
Which is hilarious,
because any time you yell at him,


221
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.270
it's like you're in a
movie with Sinatra.


222
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.390
"Come on, Frank.
Why are you acting that way?"


223
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.180
"You've changed, Frank. 
You've changed."

224
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.985
Like I said, he's a purebred...
A purebred rescue dog.


225
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.275
He was found on the mean streets
of Downey, California.


226
00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.530
If you don't know where Downey is, it's
like here, but a little more stabby.


227
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.915
Why was Frank just wandering
the mean streets of Downey, California?


228
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.915
There's either something wrong
with him, or he's wanted by the law.


229
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.215
There's something wrong with Frank.
Something very wrong with Frank.


230
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.425
Frank pees everywhere he goes,

231
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.635
inside or out, wherever the hell
he wants, Frank pees.


232
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.425
I found this out because
I got a blacklight on Amazon.


233
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.095
Yes. Well, I never
caught him in the act.


234
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:30.145
I'd always see him walking down
the hall with his fancy lady feet


235
00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.900
and a suspicious look in his fat eye.

236
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.895
I never caught him,
but I got that blacklight,


237
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.860
and I went through my house.
He has devastated my home.


238
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:43.780
Ruined it.
My office in particular, wrecked it.


239
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.700
First I didn't say anything.
I was like, "What if it's me?"


240
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.420
After careful analysis, it's Frank.
It's very low.


241
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.965
So what do you do? I got angry at first.
"How do I handle this?"


242
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:03.430
Maybe leave the back door open
and see if he wants to go for a swim?


243
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.105
Then I checked myself.

244
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.065
"No, let's get him checked out."

245
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.735
Maybe there's something really wrong
with Frank, like a bladder problem.


246
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.570
I don't know what goes on
inside pugs other than prizes.


247
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.655
Maybe there is a
urinary tract infection.


248
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.365
I took him in,
he's a healthy son of a pug.


249
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.785
Everything checks out.

250
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:30.535
There's nothing wrong with his
urinary tract. No infections.


251
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.745
What's wrong, according to the vet,

252
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.790
in medical terms, is
Frank is an asshole.


253
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.925
He knows what he's doing,
and he's gonna continue doing it


254
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.680
while he's looking me right in the face.

255
00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.475
So I went back to Amazon,
where all our answers lie,


256
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.185
and they make diapers for pugs.

257
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.895
They make diapers for pugs.
You can get 'em on Amazon.


258
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.275
I know it's pathetic.
It doesn't even look like a diaper.


259
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.485
Looks like those Velcro
back braces the UPS guy wears


260
00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:10.790
his last year on the job.
Just kind of hanging off his ass.


261
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.955
Doesn't look like it does much, but
his sciatica is really bothering him.


262
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.460
We don't call them diapers out of
respect for Sinatra. We call them pants.


263
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.845
"Come on, Frank. We got company over.
Put on some pants, will you?"


264
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.720
"For crying out loud."

265
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.765
I'll admit it felt weird
putting pants on a dog.


266
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.765
Didn't feel right, didn't feel natural.

267
00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.225
But then I thought about what
dogs have done in our short years.


268
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.605
When I was a child,
a dog was a dog.

269
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.315
It lived outside in the yard,
tied to a tree.


270
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.115
If you went somewhere,
the dog waited for your return.


271
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.445
It could be an hour, a day, a year.
The dog waited for you to come home.


272
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.705
You'd never say to your father,
"Can we bring the dog on vacation?"


273
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.370
They would have
tied you to the other tree.


274
00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.635
And look what they've accomplished now,
these dogs, I see them everywhere.


275
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.720
I see them checking
into hotels by themselves.


276
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.265
I see them in fancy restaurants,
drinking martinis,


277
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.015
boarding flights to Hawaii.

278
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.645
Well, I don't know how you did it,
dogs, but you did it.


279
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.770
You're part of the human world.
You did it. Congratulations.


280
00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:29.320
Now that you're here, take your tongue
out of your ass and take a look around.


281
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.075
And you'll notice
we're all wearing pants,


282
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.700
'cause we know what our junk
looks like and it should be covered up.


283
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.665
I don't know if you've
ever seen a pug's penis, sir.


284
00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.750
You look like you've seen
some shit in your day.


285
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.630
Maybe you did some time.
I don't know how you live.


286
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.425
If you haven't seen it,
Google it after the show.


287
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.390
All of you, Google it after the show.
Private browser, private browser.


288
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.975
Wait till you see it.
It's weird, it's misshapen,


289
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.435
it's covered in weird,
multicolored horse hairs.


290
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.230
It follows you around
the room when you walk by.


291
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.190
It looks like something
the devil would tickle you with.


292
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.330
Put on some pants.

293
00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:23.915
But, as disgusting as pugs are,
and they are, we're worse.


294
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.045
Human beings are worse.

295
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.175
I thought we were gonna be better
after all we went through.


296
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.675
I thought we'd be more germ conscious,
a little more mannerly. Nope!


297
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.805
Just as disgusting as before.
We are. We're horrible.


298
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.555
Coughing's back. 
Coughing's back.

299
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.190
Walking through the airport,
all these people acting like sea lions.


300
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.155
No one covers their mouths.

301
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.240
Spraying whole rows of people.

302
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.325
I saw a guy on the plane
clipping his nails.


303
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.705
Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Why?

304
00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.835
Why is a nail clipper in your pocket
in the first place?


305
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.205
What's in your other pocket?
Used dental floss and toilet paper?


306
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.920
What's wrong with you?

307
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.885
They're back to spitting everywhere,
those big man-spits


308
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.055
right on the sidewalk
where you're walking.


309
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.140
Those big, disgusting,
from the small intestine, windup spits.


310
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.720
It was six inches
from going out the other way.


311
00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.020
And this guy says,
"No, I'm bringing it up top."


312
00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.400
"People are gonna wanna see this."

313
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:37.200
And it just lands on the sidewalk
like an alien afterbirth.


314
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.700
It's got eyes
and a heartbeat and feelings.


315
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.330
Skitters into the sewer
and replicates itself.


316
00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.800
And that's where COVID came from.

317
00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.935
I'm not really kidding.
That's where it came from.


318
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.895
All these examples are
things that men do. Men do these things.


319
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.520
I never saw a woman blow her nose in
the air without a tissue in all my days.


320
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.115
These are things that men do. And
I know we're trying to figure it out.


321
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.865
Was it a bat?
Was it a kangaroo? Was it a lab?


322
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.405
I don't know. I know
one thing's for sure.


323
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.830
Men were involved.

324
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.705
You know.

325
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:30.670
You know, you know
some guy dared another guy


326
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:35.220
to do something weird
to a bat for $10.

327
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.975
And they went out
to an alley next to a lab,


328
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.315
and a bunch of other guys
got in a circle and cheered him on.


329
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.860
And now we're gonna be
wearing masks to the end of time.


330
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.485
We can't help it. Men. We're horrible.
Men are horrible. We're horrible.


331
00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.280
We're disgusting. Every guy in here
pees in his own yard.


332
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.500
Pees in his... Right? 
Yes, yes, yes.

333
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.250
"No, Tom, not my guy." Yeah, your guy.

334
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.800
I guarantee it, when you're not looking,
behind the lounge chair, behind the grill.


335
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.890
In the grill, if it's on.

336
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.470
Yeah, because that's a fun noise.

337
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.445
Think about it, any inconvenience
you have out in the world


338
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.735
is because men were there before,
did something horrible


339
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.735
and they had to change the rules.

340
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.825
Why can't you just walk
into a bathroom at a gas station?


341
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.660
Why do they have to give a key attached
to a chain attached to a truck tire?


342
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.080
And we have to drag it around
the building like an Egyptian slave.


343
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:57.050
Why? Because men were in there.
Horrible men doing horrible things.


344
00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.630
Playing in the toilet like a bird bath.

345
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.970
Putting their penis in the hand dryer.

346
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:09.640
Yes. You think when the Dyson came
out, that's not what they were doing?


347
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.440
That's what they're doing.

348
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.745
I know,
the lady's room is no treat either.


349
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.125
That's not because
of anything you do in there.


350
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.955
That's 'cause men sneak in there
when you're not looking


351
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.790
and use your hand dryer too.

352
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.175
But, as disgusting as we are,
and no man will dispute that fact,


353
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.595
we're good for you.

354
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.510
Men are good for you.
We make you stronger.


355
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.395
Yes, we're immunity boosters.
You think this whole thing was bad?


356
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.605
It would've been twice as bad
if men weren't fiddling their nuts


357
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.820
and grabbing every door handle in town.

358
00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:59.530
So you're welcome.

359
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.495
The other thing that men have,
and I don't understand


360
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.125
why women don't have it,
this seems backwards to me,


361
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.585
is this incredible amount
of self-esteem and self-confidence


362
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.090
built on absolutely nothing.

363
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:27.515
As awful as we are, every guy also
thinks everyone wants him all the time.


364
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:32.690
A guy will pee in his backyard, walk out
the front door and think, "She wants me."


365
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:40.105
And yet women are the most magical,
beautiful creatures on this planet,


366
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:45.445
just gliding around the globe
like cotton candy goddesses,


367
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.575
just filled with life and love

368
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.660
and beauty and self-doubt.

369
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:57.500
"Do I look fat? Do I look old? I hate
my hair. I hate my eyes. I hate my ass."


370
00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:03.670
And meanwhile, you're walking around
with a pet orangutan.


371
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.260
Who doesn't even look in the mirror.

372
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.645
The epitome of male vanity
is in the summer.


373
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:21.405
In the summer, in any town,
you will see a man, an 80-year-old man,


374
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.905
walking down the street in a tank top,
or worse, no shirt at all.


375
00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:29.825
Just strutting down the sidewalk

376
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:33.040
like an expired rotisserie chicken.

377
00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:42.670
No muscle mass left,
just two bony chicken wings.


378
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.760
Licorice nipples swaying in the wind.

379
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:58.100
Gold chains tangled
in his spooky cobweb body hair.


380
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.610
With the nerve to hit on young women.

381
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.485
God, I don't know how you women
let us climb all over you.


382
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.700
I really don't.
I would be a lesbian for sure.


383
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:18.670
Both of my daughters are straight.
I'm like, "Focus, we have time."


384
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:22.750
"You don't have to do this."

385
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.310
I am not a lesbian.

386
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.525
I am a straight, married man.

387
00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.900
I've been married now
to the same woman for 22 years.


388
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:48.200
Thank you.

389
00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.080
You don't know what I'm going through.

390
00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.085
No, she's great, of course. 22 years.
She's the best. I love her to death.


391
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.375
I'm not gonna be up here
attacking marriage.


392
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.715
I believe in marriage, really do.
It's a hard life to get through.


393
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.595
If you find someone else,
partner up through it all,


394
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.385
it's good.
It can make your life a lot better.


395
00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:14.725
If you find the right person,
and lower your expectations


396
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.930
of what you're gonna get out of it,
you'll be very happily married.


397
00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.105
I don't mean to demean it
when I say lower your expectations.


398
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:25.145
I think that's why people get divorced.

399
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.190
Too high of an expectation
of what they're gonna get


400
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.110
out of this one relationship.
It's not that much.


401
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.865
Don't put so much pressure on it.

402
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:40.535
Keep your eyes open going into it.
Don't be dumb about it. Gotta be smart.


403
00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.625
I have a friend that's thinking
about getting married.


404
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.375
He's so dumb.
The way he's talking, he's a moron.


405
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.715
He's been with the girl for five years,
the things he talks about,


406
00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.595
"She's nice,
you know, her family's pretty cool."


407
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.515
"She's smart, but I don't know
if she's hot enough."


408
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.890
"Don't know, we're talking about
getting married. She hot enough?"


409
00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.140
Are you high? Hot enough?!

410
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.395
You're talking about getting married
for the rest of your life.


411
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.655
You don't care about hot,
you don't marry hot. You marry strong.


412
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.105
You don't want a supermodel.

413
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.740
You want someone who can pick up
the other end of the couch.


414
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.870
Without taking
the cigarette out of her mouth.


415
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.670
That's who you marry.

416
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.545
No. It's a good thing.

417
00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:34.055
If you're married, and in here tonight,
it's a great night for you.


418
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:39.765
You're having a great time. There's no
pressure on you at all. You're married.


419
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.350
You don't even care if your
partner's having fun right now.


420
00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:51.360
That's not why you're here.
Let's let someone else talk for an hour.


421
00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:00.870
It's easy.

422
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.545
If you're dating,
if you're in here right now on a date,


423
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:06.710
this is a difficult night for you.

424
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:11.675
This is a lot of work.
You actually care how this goes tonight.


425
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.095
You want them to be happy.
It's a lot of pressure.


426
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.345
This is why... this is the thing
that bothers me about dating.


427
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.305
If you do get in a fight
on the way home tonight,


428
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.805
maybe off of something I'm about to say,

429
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.185
if you get in a fight tonight,

430
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:30.270
the whole relationship
could be over tonight.


431
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.900
Tonight. You could end it tonight.

432
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.830
Because you have that option.
And that's a horrible option to have.


433
00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.415
Because if you do leave, oh my God,

434
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.920
you gotta get your laptop,
and all your chargers.


435
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.715
Get a new haircut, buy some cool
clothes, go back out into the world.


436
00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.260
Lie to everybody all over again
about how great you are.


437
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:07.105
My wife and I could get in the same exact
fight tonight, and we're not breaking up.


438
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.810
We are not leaving,
because we don't have that option.


439
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:14.865
We could get in the worst fight
in the world, we are not leaving.


440
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:19.620
I'm not leaving. I get in a fight,
I don't leave. I go to the pantry.


441
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:25.910
I go to the pantry and I get
a sleeve of Girl Scout cookies.


442
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:33.050
And I eat them one by one as I'm staring
at my reflection in the toaster oven.


443
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.975
Until I feel so disgusting
that I forgive her,


444
00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:53.445
for whatever it is she said,
because I know she's probably right


445
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:58.530
because she's married to a monster person
who just ate 24 Samoas standing up.


446
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.835
I don't need cool clothes,
I don't have to get a new haircut.


447
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.545
Get a haircut when she says,
"get a haircut."


448
00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:17.425
And I get clothes when she gets
clothes... reminds me I need clothes.


449
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.470
That's how married
couples end up looking alike.


450
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.470
"Be right back, going to get sneakers."
"Wait a minute."


451
00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.270
"I need sneakers, too."

452
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.855
"You do? You wanna come?"
"Yeah, I wanna come."


453
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.320
"Let's go. Sneaker day!"

454
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.740
And we go to Footlocker
and we sit in the married section.


455
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:53.170
And they bring out sneakers that aren't
made for any athletic event whatsoever.


456
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.800
No, they're big
and they're white and they got Velcro.


457
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.260
They're good for standing
while we wait for each other.


458
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.140
"You want socks, too?"
"You read my mind."


459
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:17.480
"Socks, shorts, and sneakers. Don't bag
'em up. We're gonna wear 'em out."


460
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.070
Do we look good? No. We don't
look good. That wasn't the point.


461
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.450
The point was to make each other
unfuckable to the rest of the world.


462
00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.125
We don't need some single pervert
looking at your cool shoes


463
00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:43.720
and making a move on you. That'll
ruin the good thing we got going.


464
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.555
"What about the sex, Tom?
What about the sex?"


465
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.855
Everyone asks,
"One person for the rest of your life?"


466
00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:57.775
"What about the sex?"
Grow up. Dumbass sex.


467
00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.485
You mean the cause of every
dumb decision you've made?


468
00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.445
That sex? Sex is
fun, but it's a ride.

469
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:07.325
It's a ride. The first time I went on
Space Mountain, sure, it was exciting.


470
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:10.040
I didn't know it was gonna do that.
Whee!


471
00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.660
Hey!

472
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.130
I've been riding
Space Mountain now for 22 years.


473
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.300
I know how it goes.

474
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.340
It's fun, but you end up confused,
nauseous, and in need of a nap.


475
00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:30.595
I was staying in New York recently,

476
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.645
and the people in the hotel room
next to me were having sex.


477
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:38.605
Very loud, very rhythmic, very joyful.
And it kept going, 15, 20 minutes.


478
00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:41.440
I was like, "I guess
the pandemic's over."


479
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.525
Have fun in there. Didn't stop.
Kept going.


480
00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.785
Twenty-five, 30 minutes.
Nonstop. No break.


481
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:52.450
Thirty straight minutes. I called my
wife, I was like, "I owe you an apology."


482
00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:03.755
Didn't stop there. 35, 40 minutes.

483
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.635
We've never hit 40 minutes...

484
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.010
No, you could add in dinner.
We haven't hit 40 minutes.


485
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.810
I wouldn't want to. 40 minutes?
Get off me. I got stuff to do.


486
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.940
Where's my phone?

487
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.370
At an hour, I just put in earplugs
and cried myself to sleep.


488
00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.285
I don't wanna know
these people even exist out there.


489
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.835
Woke up the next morning,

490
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.715
Still heard it, 7:00 in the morning!
I go, wait a minute.


491
00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.130
This isn't people. This is porn.

492
00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.295
This is porn. I was so relieved.

493
00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:51.175
But then I got angry, who's in there
at the ass-end of a pandemic,


494
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.310
spraying all over like Frank?

495
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.810
A man. A disgusting man. Awful.

496
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.565
Look, I'm not gonna judge you,
or where you're at in your relationship.


497
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.615
Single or married? I don't know.

498
00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.115
These are things are complicated,
they're difficult to navigate.


499
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.405
It's tricky, you hook up with somebody

500
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:16.785
you don't know,
you're gonna go the distance?


501
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.125
That's gonna change.
You're gonna change.


502
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.045
You'll both get weird hobbies,
start doing weird things.


503
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.965
You're gonna look weird.
It's gonna change.


504
00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:28.595
You're gonna find out things about
your spouse you didn't see coming.


505
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.590
I just found out
my wife doesn't like when I read.


506
00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:38.265
She doesn't like when I read! Anything!
A book, a magazine, a cereal box.


507
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:42.605
If my wife sees me reading, she doesn't
think, "He needs some quiet time."


508
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:47.530
No, she thinks, "He's bored. Let me tell
him a story about my sister at work."


509
00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.825
"He's reading a book.
He must be really bored."


510
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.750
"Let me tell him about my mom's
new lease agreement on her apartment."


511
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.210
Ugh.

512
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.005
The other time she likes to talk
is late at night.


513
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.675
Late at night when I get into bed,
put my head on the pillow,


514
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.675
and turn out the lights.

515
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.220
That's when she likes
to talk about cancer,


516
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:24.350
child abductions, and the end of days.

517
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.780
Whatever bad news
she gathered up during the day,


518
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:34.320
she's gonna sprinkle
on my side of the bed.


519
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:40.120
Until she unloads and starts to snore.

520
00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:50.130
As soon as she turns out the light, "I
spoke to your mom on the phone today."


521
00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:56.010
"She sounded so old. I wonder
how much more time we have with her."


522
00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.020
"Have you pet the cat recently?
He's got a tumor on his neck."


523
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:11.110
"Carol's cat grew a tumor. It's so big,
it looks like he's wearing a hat."


524
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.495
"Did I mention I spoke to your mom
on the phone today?"


525
00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:19.035
"Who's older, your
mother or your father?"


526
00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.580
"One of 'em's not making it
to Christmas, I can feel it."


527
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:30.215
"I can't believe our daughters
are going away to college soon."


528
00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.715
"It's terrible to think they'll be out in
the world with all those horrible men."


529
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.265
"Probably no more horrible
than what they're doing


530
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:39.850
in their rooms on their phones
right now, though."


531
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.140
"Carol's daughters have been
taking pictures of their vaginas,


532
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.390
putting 'em on the internet."

533
00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.650
"Do you think that's what
our daughters are doing right now?"


534
00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:01.660
"Twenty feet from our bed,
on our family plan?"


535
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.790
"I spoke to your mom.
I spoke to your mom on the..."


536
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.430
And I stare at the ceiling
for six straight hours


537
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.145
just waiting for the sun to come up

538
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:30.920
so I can get some coffee, and get away
from this devil woman I sleep with.


539
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:39.535
Shouldn't be sleeping in the
same bed anymore. Not all the time.


540
00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.035
Once in a while it's fun.

541
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.165
But, you know look, I hope
you find love in life. I really do.


542
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.165
I hope you're as
lucky as I have been.

543
00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.335
It doesn't mean a life sentence
of having to be in the same bed


544
00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.710
with your partner
for the rest of your life.


545
00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:55.255
Oh my God. Look, I tell her,
"Look, someone's leaving tonight."


546
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.345
"Someone's getting the pillow,
kicking the other one


547
00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:01.305
and leaving in the middle
of the night in a rage."


548
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.350
Why not do that at 10:00,
with a peck on the cheek?


549
00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:11.770
"Love you. Mwah.
See you in the morning. Mwah"


550
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.405
She won't do it. She's hanging on to
the young version of us.


551
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.365
And of course, starting out,
you should be in the same bed.


552
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:22.285
You have to be!
You're young, sexual, you're in love.


553
00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.115
Make love three times a night.

554
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.915
You end up asleep in a pretzel twist,
foot in your face, hanging upside down.


555
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.085
And you do sleep well that way.

556
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:34.415
That's the thing. You actually sleep
a solid eight hours that way.


557
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.755
And you wake up in the morning
so refreshed and in love.


558
00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.005
You look at each other,
"Let's do it again."


559
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.600
"Let's have morning sex," you say.

560
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.600
We don't say that where I live.

561
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:51.605
No, we're too busy in the morning
pointing at each other


562
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:56.190
and blaming each other
for who ruined the sleep last night.


563
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:05.615
"It was you. There's something
wrong with you."


564
00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.830
"Oh, no. You need a doctor."

565
00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.040
"There's something inside of you
and it's trying to get out."


566
00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:22.255
And the reality is it's probably
both of us because we're over 40.


567
00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.635
And if you're over 40,
you have a 50% chance of getting


568
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.685
a good night's sleep tonight.

569
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:29.685
Fifty percent. 
Just you, alone.

570
00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:32.355
Fifty percent chance
you'll get a good night's sleep.


571
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.150
'Cause you're dying.
You're slowly dying.


572
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.320
Your body's trying to choke you out
and technology's keeping you alive.


573
00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.445
Fifty percent chance you'll get
a good night's sleep.


574
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:48.915
And not 'cause you did something crazy,
not 'cause you went on a cocaine bender.


575
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.370
No, someone had a cookie after 6:00.

576
00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.045
"Donna had cheese at the party. Oh, no!"

577
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.970
"She's not going
to breathe right for a week."


578
00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.890
"Bob had three beers. Three beers.
Welcome to the Fart Palace."


579
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.310
"Buckle up. No one's sleeping tonight."

580
00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.945
My wife has a lot going on.
She grinds her teeth in her sleep.


581
00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:26.450
She's so angry she's grinding
her own teeth down to nubs.


582
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.165
Rather than find out the cause
of that, they don't do that.


583
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.410
Instead they just give
her an NFL issued mouthpiece


584
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:37.540
and just shove that in her mouth
like a chew toy from Petco.


585
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:44.380
She goes through three or four
a month like an angry beaver.


586
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.640
I wake up with bits
of plastic all over my face.


587
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.270
And it's blue and
it glows in the dark.

588
00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:05.025
Yeah, that's how I know
if we're fooling around at night.


589
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.530
If I see a blue floaty thing
coming across the room...


590
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:12.740
Not happening.

591
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.830
Not tonight.
She just put on her equipment.


592
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:26.215
Put on her headgear and her mouthguard
and her eucalyptus ointments,


593
00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.600
climbs into bed with her
unshaved legs like a koala bear.


594
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:35.100
Like an angry koala bear
trying out for the Packers.


595
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:45.815
And she gets up to pee like six,
seven times a night.


596
00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.780
I didn't know a woman could have
a swollen prostate, but she does.


597
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:53.915
And when she walks, her ankle pops.

598
00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.700
You can hear it! 
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

599
00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:02.585
You don't hear it during the day when
there's leaf blowers and garbage trucks.


600
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:04.715
You don't hear it at all.

601
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.385
Three o'clock in the morning,
loudest sound you'll ever hear.


602
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:09.925
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

603
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.760
Trying to breathe
through the mouthpiece...


604
00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:18.895
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

605
00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:22.770
It's like Darth Vader's trapped
in bubble wrap in my bedroom.


606
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:27.070
And that's why you
should get married, too.


607
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:44.215
It's weird being a
human being, isn't it?


608
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.800
This is weird, what you're going
through. I know, 'cause I'm one, too.


609
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:49.595
It's weird.

610
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.055
The reason we're here,
to connect with people.


611
00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.225
It's our whole thing,
connect with people.


612
00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:58.145
Befriend people, date people,
marry people, make new people.


613
00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:01.145
But everybody that you
fall in love with, connect with,


614
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:04.315
you have more to worry about.
Every love is a worry.


615
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.820
It's a weird way to live.
That's why everyone's on drugs.


616
00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.615
First time I took my daughter

617
00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.035
into a doctor's appointment
when she was a baby,


618
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.705
Her first doctor's appointment I
realized, "I'm never gonna sleep again."


619
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:22.125
I never loved something so much
and felt so vulnerable at the same time.


620
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.375
It's a weird way to live.
Everything was cool, but terrifying.


621
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.795
Doctor's like, "Everything's great,
everything's good."


622
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.085
"Okay, good."

623
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.595
"One thing."
"Oh, shit. What is it?"


624
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.015
Start sweating immediately.

625
00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.930
"Not a big deal, but her
head is in the fifth percentile."


626
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:44.815
"What does that mean?"

627
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.110
"It means that 95% of the heads
out there are bigger than her head."


628
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.195
"What?"
"Yes. Only 5% of the population


629
00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.575
have a head as small as your daughter."

630
00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.455
"You don't see them,
'cause they're scurrying in the dark


631
00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.200
from alleyway to alleyway."

632
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:05.380
"What?"

633
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:08.295
"Not a big deal. We'll just
check every six months."


634
00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.585
"Okay."
I got her home,


635
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.465
I took her to the playroom,
started blowing in her mouth.


636
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:15.970
"Come on, grow."

637
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:22.105
Panicked for two years. There's nothing
to worry. Everyone's head grows.


638
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:25.435
You never walk through the mall,
see someone with a ping pong head


639
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.730
walking down the hall,
with a bottle cap for a hat. "Hello."


640
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.320
No, everyone's head is fine.

641
00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.745
But you shouldn't stop loving
because of the fear. You can't.


642
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:41.325
The more love, the less you actually
are frightened. You keep doing it.


643
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:44.955
All the closest people in your life,
you don't know what they're up to.


644
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.665
Everyone's got their own secrets, lives.
You're not responsible for them.


645
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:51.050
Even the people you make!
Even your children!


646
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.045
My daughter came home from college,
first year of college,


647
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:56.465
I was like, "You're an adult now.
Welcome home."


648
00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:00.095
"Would you like some wine with dinner?
You're a grown-up now. Welcome."


649
00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.435
"How about some wine?"
"No, thanks, Dad. I don't drink."


650
00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.725
"Oh."
"I don't like alcohol."


651
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:08.900
"Oh. What a good dad I am."

652
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.650
She said, "I only smoke weed."

653
00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:16.865
"Oh? How long you been doing that?"

654
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.700
"Since I was a freshman in high school,"
she said!


655
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:22.310
"Oh?"

656
00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:26.040
"Where?"
"In my room," she said.


657
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.125
Four years, straight A student.

658
00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:34.465
High as a kite, in my house.
She loved the weed.


659
00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.180
Here's the problem.
I love the weed more.


660
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.885
And for four years I didn't smoke it
because I wanted to be


661
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.140
a good example for the children.

662
00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.225
For four years, I ate
nothing but handfuls


663
00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:52.445
of melatonin gummies
to get some kind of buzz


664
00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:54.275
and eventually fall asleep.

665
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.200
She was doing bong hits
right down the hall.


666
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.705
My real goal, what I've learned having
these kids is make good people.


667
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:15.335
There's a lot of bad people,
there's a lot of good people.


668
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.675
We can't change the bad people,
apparently,


669
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.015
but maybe we could outnumber them
by making more good people.


670
00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.760
Should be easy.

671
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:31.145
It's not like bad people are making
great kids. No, they make shitty kids.


672
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:35.900
You see them out there, knocking things
over in restaurants, falling down wells.


673
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.950
I don't know why
we even scoop 'em out.

674
00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:43.615
Who's falling down a
well? Not a good kid.


675
00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.540
They're gonna fall again.

676
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:50.415
Seems like it should be easy to change
bad people, doesn't it? Should be easy.


677
00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:54.585
Your life will be
better if you just turn it down a notch,


678
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:56.795
and try and get along
with the rest of us.


679
00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.385
I know you don't care about anyone else,
but your life will be better,


680
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:03.515
and less stressed
if you just turn it down a notch.


681
00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.015
We're not even asking you
to do anything extra.


682
00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.640
Just do less of what you're doing now.

683
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:12.810
Start small.

684
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:14.775
Start small.

685
00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.980
Don't put testicles
on the back of your pickup truck.


686
00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:20.990
Why are you doing that?

687
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.410
What is wrong with you?
And why are you doing that?


688
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.825
I have a minivan filled
with children and old people.


689
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.960
We don't need you teabagging us
on the freeway.


690
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.255
Not easy to be good,
you gotta work at it.


691
00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.965
You're good people, I can tell. People
at my shows are always nice people.


692
00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:46.300
But you gotta work at it.
You all drive cars,


693
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.765
so I know you're an asshole
once in a while.


694
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:52.185
Everyone's merging, a nice beautiful
day. You even surprise yourself.


695
00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:53.895
All of a sudden, out of nowhere,

696
00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.520
"Not today, you old bag.
You're not getting in front of me. No!"


697
00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:01.485
"I feel you're looking at me.
I'm not gonna look back."


698
00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:04.950
"Not today, raisin face. Not today."

699
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.245
Where the hell did that come from?

700
00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:11.125
Got to work at it.
Be nice to people in customer service.


701
00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:14.875
Be nice to people in customer service.
You think they want to wait on you?


702
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.665
These people waiting...
No, you're not the queen


703
00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:19.925
because you walked into a restaurant.

704
00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.885
They don't want to wait on you.
They just... It's their job.


705
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.055
They just wanna make money,
pay their rent,


706
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.030
and buy some cocaine on the way home.

707
00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:30.975
And from a former busboy,

708
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.810
be nice to the busboys,
those people will lick your rolls.


709
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.405
Be nice to people
in customer service on the phone.


710
00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:44.325
You think these kids in India
want these jobs? Helping us?


711
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.825
No, they just want
their families to survive.


712
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:49.995
Can you imagine them telling
their friends they got these jobs?


713
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.870
"I got a job today."
"Good for you! What are you doing?"


714
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.830
"I'm gonna help Americans
fix their computers over the phone."


715
00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.040
"Oh, no!"

716
00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:03.010
"You don't even have a computer."
"I know."


717
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.180
"You hardly speak English."
"I know."


718
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.430
"They're gonna kill you."
"I start tomorrow."


719
00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.605
I'm supporting babies who cry
on airplanes.


720
00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:19.565
Yeah. I'm team baby now.

721
00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:22.655
I'm always next to some businessman
who's always complaining.


722
00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.735
"Who's gonna shut that damn kid up?"

723
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.695
No, wait a minute. You shut up.
You're a man.


724
00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.530
You're a man with
hairy arms and a wallet.


725
00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:36.665
You chose to be on this flight.
That baby doesn't wanna be here.


726
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:40.545
No baby wants to be at 30,000 feet
with their skeleton collapsing


727
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:42.590
like a Poland Spring bottle.

728
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:48.175
Sitting at ass level with all you
middle-aged gas bags,


729
00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.890
crop dusting them on
the way to your seat.


730
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:55.015
No, that kid's in
a bad spot right now.

731
00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.480
He should be crying on the airplane.

732
00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:00.475
We all should be crying on the airplane.

733
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.230
He's the only honest one
on the goddamn plane.


734
00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:12.955
And let me be clear.
I'm not even a fan of babies.


735
00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.075
I'm not. I made two
and I still don't like 'em.


736
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.960
I don't trust anyone who's heart you can
see beating out of the top of their head.


737
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:24.715
Useless dinner roll feet,
can't stand for years.


738
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.755
No, I don't like them. But if
a kid's crying, they're in a bad spot.


739
00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.845
They're at church, restaurant
or on a plane. You know, let 'em cry.


740
00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:36.015
You took 'em out too early.
Why you gotta take them everywhere?


741
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.850
They're babies. Leave 'em at home.
That's a happy baby.


742
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.520
At home, 72 degrees, naked,
Cheerios stuck to their torso.


743
00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:47.740
Eating out of the cat dish.
That's a happy baby.


744
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.985
You gotta go out, putting a big
pink bow on her bald head


745
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:54.160
so everyone stops calling her a boy.

746
00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:58.660
She looks like a boy.
She's not done yet.


747
00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:04.840
She looks like a man. She looks like
a middle-aged man working at the docks.


748
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.800
Give her a year, let her fill
in, then take her for a ride.


749
00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.765
Now you wanna complain
to me about toddlers


750
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:18.640
who have their own seats in
business class? I'll listen to you.


751
00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.030
Because that should be illegal.

752
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.355
I travel a lot,
that's tough to take, my friends,


753
00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.065
when I don't get the upgrade,
and I'm jammed in coach


754
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:29.985
between two sumo
wrestlers in track suits


755
00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:33.360
eating pretzels like a praying mantis
for six hours.


756
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:42.035
And the toddler standing naked
in my seat, drinking a mimosa


757
00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.960
and giving me the finger
through the curtain.


758
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.800
Tough to take.

759
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:56.595
Look, I understand why we get angry
at babies, hearing them cry on a plane.


760
00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.305
Because you're scared. That
businessman's scared. We're all scared.


761
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:03.515
It's scary up there. Scary. It's scary.

762
00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:06.395
We're not far from
the children that we were.


763
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.985
You get scared, hear a cry for help,
and get more unnerved.


764
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.905
That was the nice thing about being home
for two years, you feel safe at home.


765
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:17.285
Gives you this illusion that you've
got control over the universe.


766
00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:18.705
Which, of course, we don't.

767
00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:23.120
But at least there you know where the
toilet paper is, where all the spoons go.


768
00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:25.415
Then as soon as you travel,
it's uncertainty.


769
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.540
I've had a great time with you tonight.

770
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:30.125
This was a wonderful experience.
I love all of you,


771
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:32.010
but it was hell getting here.

772
00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.135
Soon as you get to security,

773
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.175
you're like a third grader
being yelled at by the principal.


774
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.435
As soon as you leave your house,
Security's holding up your bag.


775
00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.430
"Whose bag is this?"
"Ah, shit. My bag."


776
00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:46.900
"Is there water in here?"
"Maybe."


777
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.230
"You're a moron."
"No, I can do things."


778
00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.915
Then you get to the hotel,
more uncertainty, right?


779
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.575
How does the key work?
How does the elevator work?


780
00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.375
How's the remote control?
How's the thermostat work?


781
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:08.170
Whose curly hair is this?

782
00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:16.465
How do you turn on the lamp?
How do you turn on the damn lamp?


783
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:20.265
Why are there so many lamps? You
can never find the switch on the lamp.


784
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:24.680
Is it on the base? Is it on the stem?
Is it a chain? Where's the switch?


785
00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:30.110
You put it on the wire, under the table?
You heartless sons of bitches.


786
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:40.035
I'm just a strange man
in a strange town trying to survive.


787
00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:43.075
This is the easiest travel
you could have, by the way.


788
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:46.665
This is alone with a wheelie bag.
Then you travel with your family.


789
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:52.215
Oh. That's hell on Earth.
A family vacation? Don't do that.


790
00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.505
Don't do that. Look, a family
is a bad organization.


791
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:57.680
It barely works at home.

792
00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.890
Why would you take it on the road?

793
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.055
And I'm always so stupid.
I always think,


794
00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:06.515
when we get to the resort,
then I'll have fun.


795
00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.895
Travel will be hell, of course, but when
we get to the resort, I'll have my time.


796
00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.315
No, you moron.

797
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.315
Now you're in this weird reality show
with obstacles being thrown at you


798
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.575
you couldn't even dream of.
They come running out of nowhere.


799
00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:23.080
"Your wife was just stung
in the vagina by a jellyfish, go!"


800
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.455
"Your mother-in-law is trying out
her Spanish on the busboy


801
00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.800
and saying slightly
racist comments, go!"


802
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.630
<i>Lo siento, lo siento.</i>

803
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.015
"Your youngest child broke out in hives
in the middle of the night."


804
00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:48.435
"There's not a hospital for hours.
What do you do?" What do I do?


805
00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.275
I'm gonna get a dirty Benadryl
out of the bottom of my backpack,


806
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.565
take the hair off
it, give it to her,

807
00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:58.030
put her back in bed
and hope she wakes up in the morning.


808
00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.820
I'm not a doctor.
I'm a drunk dad on vacation.


809
00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:13.835
And news flash, the kids
don't wanna be there either.


810
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:17.835
No kid wants to be trapped in a hotel
room with their half-naked parents.


811
00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.675
The only two people
who can get them in trouble.


812
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.305
Your whole childhood is spent
getting away from your parents.


813
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.975
Hiding in tree houses, piles of leaves,
sleeping over at your friend's house.


814
00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.895
My friends and I used
to play in a drain pipe.


815
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:37.735
A drain pipe that took all the human waste
from the town and dumped it in the lake.


816
00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:41.860
Yes, that's where we played,
in the town shit pipe.


817
00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.660
And we loved it

818
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:48.540
because we knew our parents would
never look for us in the shit pipe.


819
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.205
"Tom's been gone awhile.
Do you think he's in the pipe?"


820
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:53.875
"No."

821
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.965
It's scary in the shit pipe.

822
00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:58.715
It was! There were ghosts
and that clown from <i>It</i>.


823
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.460
It was scary in there.

824
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:04.845
But I would much rather be in the pipe
than sitting in a hotel room


825
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:09.185
at the end of the bed waiting for
my father to come out of the bathroom


826
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:10.970
for an hour and a half.

827
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:15.100
"What are those noises?"

828
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:20.700
"Sounded like a bear rummaging through
a dumpster filled with balloons."


829
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:26.780
He'd come out an hour later.
"I wouldn't go in there if I were you."


830
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:30.660
"But I have to go in there.
There's nowhere else to go."


831
00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:33.750
Walking through a toxic haze.

832
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:37.670
"Why does it smell like
an antique pet shop in here?"


833
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.380
Standing in your socks in water.
"What did he do?"


834
00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.095
That's childhood, isn't it?

835
00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:49.595
Being stuck in your socks,
in some place you didn't ask to go.


836
00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:53.185
It's tough being a kid, isn't it?
It's like a hostage situation.


837
00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:57.395
Eighteen years being dragged around
by these two kidnappers.


838
00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.445
No money, no identification. 18 years.

839
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.275
No decision is your own.

840
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.445
"Get in the car."
"Where're we going?"


841
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:07.490
"I said get in the car."

842
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:14.750
Thank you so much for coming.

843
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:19.290
You guys were tremendous.
Thank you so much.


844
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:30.975
Sincerely, thank you so much.
Take care of yourselves.


845
00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:35.390
Take care of yourselves and I'll see you
next time around. Thank you.
