1
00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:42.084
Yes.

2
00:02:42.126 --> 00:02:44.084
<i>Frank, where are you?</i>

3
00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.542
On my way. Why?

4
00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:46.667
<i>Why!?</i>

5
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.917
<i>Did you see how
many times I tried to call?</i>


6
00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:49.834
Now, yes!

7
00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:50.959
Sorry,

8
00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.126
didn't hear the phone.

9
00:02:54.626 --> 00:02:55.334
Have...

10
00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:57.209
Have you left yet?

11
00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.459
Are you still there?

12
00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:04.126
Yes.

13
00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.334
<i>I'm asking myself if I really
should bring her to you at all.</i>


14
00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.417
I can handle this.

15
00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:12.334
<i>I hope so, for your sake, Frank.</i>

16
00:03:13.084 --> 00:03:15.126
<i>Even more so for Lily's.</i>

17
00:03:15.376 --> 00:03:17.876
<i>But if you screw up again your weekend...</i>

18
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:21.001
<i>then there won't be a next time.</i>

19
00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:23.334
Got it.

20
00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.876
<i>All right then...</i>

21
00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:28.334
See you later.

22
00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:41.084
Hmm rough night huh?

23
00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:43.042
That would be news to me.

24
00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:45.126
These and number four.

25
00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:51.292
These, too.

26
00:05:57.376 --> 00:05:58.626
Something for you?

27
00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:59.709
No,

28
00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:02.001
she's too old for that.

29
00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:15.792
Just get on with it.

30
00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:40.251
Need a light?

31
00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:44.876
No.

32
00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:46.959
Ah. Okay,

33
00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:52.167
Can I help you with something?

34
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:54.167
I just wanted to ask where you're headed.

35
00:06:55.001 --> 00:06:56.001
Why?

36
00:06:56.334 --> 00:06:58.959
My ride didn't show.

37
00:06:59.876 --> 00:07:00.959
Mm...

38
00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:03.209
Where do you need to go?

39
00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:05.001
Berlin.

40
00:07:14.334 --> 00:07:16.001
Sure whatever.

41
00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:18.334
Seriously?

42
00:07:18.834 --> 00:07:20.167
Yeah, why not...

43
00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:22.584
Just to make things clear,

44
00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:24.834
I like loud music and
I'm not in the mood for chit-chat.


45
00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:25.834
Is that a problem?

46
00:07:25.834 --> 00:07:27.959
No problem at all.

47
00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:29.792
And thank you.

48
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:39.251
The trunk is full. Give me that.

49
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:48.251
That's very kind of you, Frank.

50
00:07:50.084 --> 00:07:51.126
Have we met?

51
00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:52.167
No,

52
00:07:52.584 --> 00:07:54.334
but I can read.

53
00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.334
Andreas.

54
00:08:06.292 --> 00:08:08.126
Seatbelt.

55
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:38.251
Crazy, how many people seem to
drive with a death wish.


56
00:09:42.334 --> 00:09:44.334
There goes another one!

57
00:09:51.334 --> 00:09:54.334
One mistake and it all could be over.

58
00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:58.334
A little distracted,

59
00:09:58.876 --> 00:09:59.917
showing off.

60
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:02.501
Maybe even a little bit tipsy.

61
00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:04.042
Game over.

62
00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:12.167
Tchah, there's your next candidate.

63
00:10:13.792 --> 00:10:15.834
Nice car, though.

64
00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:24.001
Nowadays it's much safer.

65
00:10:24.084 --> 00:10:27.126
Airbags front, side and back.

66
00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:34.084
It helps if you know how to drive!

67
00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:36.334
I guess.

68
00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:33.251
Lots of people even drive after
the disco. That's asking for it.


69
00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:37.834
Suddenly, it's not only your life
that's at stake, it's your passenger's too.


70
00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:45.292
Sorry, I don't mean to bug you, but...

71
00:11:47.876 --> 00:11:49.959
Honestly, I've...

72
00:11:58.876 --> 00:12:00.084
Don't move!

73
00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:01.917
Don't move!

74
00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:34.292
The backpack!

75
00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:37.084
Is that a RCD or a VOD!?

76
00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:38.667
My hose!

77
00:12:38.751 --> 00:12:39.917
Are you crazy!?

78
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:41.042
RCD or VOD!?

79
00:12:41.126 --> 00:12:42.834
I can't breathe.

80
00:12:44.626 --> 00:12:46.251
I am only going to
ask you one more time.

81
00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:47.792
RCD or VOD!?

82
00:12:47.876 --> 00:12:49.334
I don't know what you're talking about!

83
00:12:58.626 --> 00:13:00.167
My nose...

84
00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:04.959
What was that all about?

85
00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:07.792
Were you trying to suffocate me?

86
00:13:10.917 --> 00:13:12.959
I still need that lift to Berlin.

87
00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:22.876
Wait, wait, wait...

88
00:13:22.876 --> 00:13:24.834
Get in on this side.

89
00:13:26.834 --> 00:13:28.126
Come on.

90
00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:30.417
Hey...

91
00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:33.334
it might be broken I think.

92
00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:35.834
Yeah!

93
00:14:40.042 --> 00:14:42.084
Well, maybe it isn't.

94
00:14:59.334 --> 00:15:02.334
I'll shoot your balls off, if necessary.

95
00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:06.709
Stay calm, get me to Berlin,
and everything will be fine.


96
00:15:27.209 --> 00:15:28.292
Did you see that?

97
00:15:28.501 --> 00:15:30.751
We'll make a brief stop there.

98
00:15:32.251 --> 00:15:35.209
All right. One milkshake, vanilla, large.

99
00:15:35.584 --> 00:15:39.334
And one Waffle Beast
with chocolate sauce.


100
00:15:40.834 --> 00:15:42.834
Will there be anything else?

101
00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:45.209
What kind of burger do you want?

102
00:15:45.292 --> 00:15:46.334
Nothing.

103
00:15:46.542 --> 00:15:48.834
Ooh come on. Tell me.

104
00:15:49.042 --> 00:15:50.334
I just did.

105
00:15:51.042 --> 00:15:52.334
Some fries...

106
00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:54.626
Come on now.

107
00:15:57.084 --> 00:15:58.084
Any Burger.

108
00:15:58.334 --> 00:15:59.834
Any Burger?

109
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:03.001
Any Burger doesn't exist, does it?

110
00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:05.917
Big Beast.

111
00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:09.126
Okay, that's...

112
00:16:09.209 --> 00:16:12.209
And some ice cubes in an extra cup.

113
00:16:13.334 --> 00:16:15.917
That makes one Icy Beast...

114
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:19.459
Oh sorry, I mean one Waffle
Beast with chocolate sauce,


115
00:16:19.584 --> 00:16:22.084
one vanilla shake large,

116
00:16:22.167 --> 00:16:25.292
medium fries and one Big Beast.

117
00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:26.834
And...

118
00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:29.959
some ice cubes in an extra cup.

119
00:16:30.001 --> 00:16:31.792
Make that a menu.

120
00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:34.792
Er...

121
00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:37.709
those are all single items.

122
00:16:37.959 --> 00:16:38.667
If you add...

123
00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:40.834
How is it single?

124
00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:47.084
Fries, Big Beast, Beverage. I mean...
sounds exactly like a menu to me.


125
00:16:48.209 --> 00:16:49.209
What!

126
00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:51.209
Hey just make it a menu!

127
00:16:51.292 --> 00:16:52.251
But a shake doesn't...

128
00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:54.417
Do you even speak my language!?

129
00:16:54.751 --> 00:16:55.667
I think so...

130
00:16:55.876 --> 00:16:57.417
Well, then what's the fucking problem!?

131
00:16:57.501 --> 00:16:58.709
One extra cola then.

132
00:16:58.792 --> 00:17:00.751
With the menu, please.

133
00:17:00.834 --> 00:17:02.084
All right.

134
00:17:04.126 --> 00:17:06.751
I need a menu with... er... No. Fries.

135
00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:07.501
It's on me.

136
00:17:07.584 --> 00:17:12.834
Vanilla milkshake large and er...

137
00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.084
No first aid kit?

138
00:17:27.042 --> 00:17:28.709
What's in the bag?

139
00:17:28.792 --> 00:17:30.209
Clothes.

140
00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:31.709
Open it.

141
00:17:31.792 --> 00:17:33.876
I told you, it's just clothes.

142
00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:37.084
Open it. Now.

143
00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.792
Perfect.

144
00:18:09.584 --> 00:18:12.584
And now tie it up nice and tight.

145
00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:23.834
Careful now.

146
00:18:32.917 --> 00:18:34.167
Thanks.

147
00:18:34.584 --> 00:18:36.167
Get in.

148
00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:21.792
Eat otherwise It will get cold.

149
00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:28.334
For once I'm buying and
now you don't want any?


150
00:19:31.959 --> 00:19:33.334
Eat.

151
00:19:45.126 --> 00:19:48.126
I don't want you to faint on me.

152
00:19:53.334 --> 00:19:55.209
It's amazing.

153
00:19:56.834 --> 00:20:01.501
Somewhere at the end of the
world there's a giant sugar plantation.


154
00:20:01.626 --> 00:20:03.584
A cucumber monoculture here,

155
00:20:03.667 --> 00:20:05.209
tomato factory there.

156
00:20:05.292 --> 00:20:07.667
Cattle as far as the eye can see.

157
00:20:07.751 --> 00:20:09.209
Mix it all up

158
00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:11.334
Ta-da!

159
00:20:11.876 --> 00:20:13.917
A Burger.

160
00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:18.917
Exactly the same, everywhere.

161
00:20:22.917 --> 00:20:25.084
It's quite tasty actually.

162
00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:33.001
Nothing to to with real food though.

163
00:20:38.126 --> 00:20:40.001
No, no. Eat up.

164
00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:57.501
You should wipe your mouth.
You're oozing quite a bit of ketchup there!


165
00:21:02.334 --> 00:21:05.334
Always the same, same taste,

166
00:21:06.042 --> 00:21:07.959
consistency too.

167
00:21:08.042 --> 00:21:11.417
And before you know it, the whole
world speaks American. Crazy right?


168
00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:14.834
You know, there is a thing
called the Big-Boss-Index.


169
00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:18.959
It determines how much a
Big Boss should cost in comparison


170
00:21:19.167 --> 00:21:20.834
to the cost of living
in any given country.


171
00:21:20.917 --> 00:21:21.917
What are you going
to do with the bomb?

172
00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:24.417
No, not the cost of living er, the...

173
00:21:24.501 --> 00:21:26.167
What are you going
to do with the bomb?

174
00:21:26.292 --> 00:21:28.292
The purchasing power.

175
00:21:41.126 --> 00:21:43.126
Slow down... Now!

176
00:21:44.834 --> 00:21:48.001
You are making a huge mistake.
Slow down, goddamn idiot!


177
00:21:48.167 --> 00:21:48.876
Do what you want.

178
00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:49.959
Slow down!

179
00:21:50.001 --> 00:21:52.001
I'll crash us into the next tree.

180
00:21:52.084 --> 00:21:54.084
I don't give a shit.

181
00:21:57.084 --> 00:21:58.584
I'll do it.

182
00:21:58.834 --> 00:22:00.376
This is what's going to happen.

183
00:22:00.459 --> 00:22:04.917
You stay calm and do as I tell you,
then this won't end badly.


184
00:22:05.042 --> 00:22:06.667
Understood?

185
00:22:06.834 --> 00:22:09.667
This is on you, Frank. Only you.

186
00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:19.126
No bullshit now. Keep your
hands where they are.


187
00:22:20.084 --> 00:22:21.917
Just stay calm.

188
00:22:22.042 --> 00:22:23.167
Don't try anything.

189
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:24.917
Wrong, Frank.

190
00:22:25.084 --> 00:22:26.792
It's already happening.

191
00:22:26.876 --> 00:22:28.709
At this very moment.

192
00:22:30.209 --> 00:22:32.709
The only question to remain
is what will happen to whom.


193
00:22:32.876 --> 00:22:36.667
To me. To you. 
To those puppets.

194
00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:39.959
Or to Lily.

195
00:22:42.209 --> 00:22:43.626
Hey!

196
00:22:45.709 --> 00:22:47.042
Stay calm.

197
00:22:47.209 --> 00:22:49.126
Nothing is decided yet.

198
00:22:51.001 --> 00:22:53.001
Think about Lily.

199
00:22:59.751 --> 00:23:01.917
That was really good.

200
00:23:02.042 --> 00:23:05.876
I'll take that. I'll take...
three... then you can...


201
00:23:06.042 --> 00:23:08.917
Do you want to roll again? Again.

202
00:23:09.084 --> 00:23:12.084
I'll take the two little mice...

203
00:23:15.459 --> 00:23:17.459
Listen carefully.

204
00:23:18.292 --> 00:23:19.751
Listen!

205
00:23:20.459 --> 00:23:23.084
This is what's going to happen.

206
00:23:23.959 --> 00:23:26.501
If I don't check in,

207
00:23:26.751 --> 00:23:29.751
there is nothing I can do
for your little girl.


208
00:23:31.501 --> 00:23:32.834
Those two.

209
00:23:33.084 --> 00:23:34.209
If they don't leave,

210
00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:36.126
they need to go.

211
00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:38.667
Understood?

212
00:23:44.167 --> 00:23:46.917
Have I made myself clear?

213
00:23:54.959 --> 00:23:57.501
This is on you Frank.

214
00:23:59.792 --> 00:24:02.709
I told you not to fuck around.

215
00:24:04.917 --> 00:24:07.917
I only ever wanted to get to Berlin.

216
00:24:19.292 --> 00:24:20.709
Nice car.

217
00:24:22.126 --> 00:24:23.709
License and registration, please.

218
00:24:23.792 --> 00:24:25.626
All here.

219
00:24:29.042 --> 00:24:30.626
Thanks.

220
00:24:36.084 --> 00:24:38.959
You have had your license
for 19 years now.


221
00:24:40.126 --> 00:24:42.834
Can you tell me why you had to
accelerate so hastily back there?


222
00:24:43.042 --> 00:24:47.376
And why you crossed those road
markings without any apparent reason?


223
00:24:49.709 --> 00:24:51.751
What was that all about?

224
00:24:52.084 --> 00:24:55.084
I have to get to
the train station in Berlin.


225
00:24:55.167 --> 00:24:58.084
My wife, my soon-to-be-ex-wife is
bringing our daughter over for Christmas.


226
00:24:58.167 --> 00:25:02.167
It's the first time she'll
stay with me for a while longer.


227
00:25:04.042 --> 00:25:05.959
And because of that, you think
you can drive anyway you like?


228
00:25:06.251 --> 00:25:08.084
No. Of course not. You're right.

229
00:25:08.542 --> 00:25:12.751
I'm just nervous and can't be late.

230
00:25:13.251 --> 00:25:13.917
Ok...

231
00:25:14.792 --> 00:25:15.959
and your co-driver?

232
00:25:16.626 --> 00:25:18.751
Is your friend going to pick up
your wife as well?


233
00:25:18.876 --> 00:25:21.834
This is Alex. He always comes along.

234
00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:26.334
Mister Balzer, have you
had anything to drink?


235
00:25:26.459 --> 00:25:27.084
No.

236
00:25:27.376 --> 00:25:29.042
Other substances?

237
00:25:29.126 --> 00:25:29.792
No.

238
00:25:29.876 --> 00:25:31.209
Sure?

239
00:25:31.709 --> 00:25:33.709
I just want to get to Berlin
and to my daughter.


240
00:25:34.334 --> 00:25:37.084
Could you please just let us go?
Nothing has happened.


241
00:25:37.209 --> 00:25:38.792
Would you please step out of the car.

242
00:25:39.209 --> 00:25:40.917
Your friend Alex can stay in the car.

243
00:25:41.042 --> 00:25:42.667
Why?

244
00:25:43.126 --> 00:25:45.376
Can't you just write me up
and send me the ticket?


245
00:25:45.459 --> 00:25:47.459
Step out!

246
00:25:47.917 --> 00:25:50.417
I'll have to call in soon, Frank.

247
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:52.501
Think about Lily.

248
00:25:58.209 --> 00:25:59.042
You don't understand.

249
00:25:59.126 --> 00:25:59.709
Mister Balzer!

250
00:25:59.834 --> 00:26:02.834
I can't be late or they'll
take away my visiting rights.


251
00:26:03.084 --> 00:26:04.626
I am really sorry about that.

252
00:26:04.709 --> 00:26:07.709
But that has nothing to do
with the issue at hand.


253
00:26:07.834 --> 00:26:10.709
At the moment I'm only interested
in whether you've been drinking or not,


254
00:26:10.834 --> 00:26:14.084
or if you have anything more
to say concerning our situation here.


255
00:26:14.251 --> 00:26:15.001
No.

256
00:26:15.376 --> 00:26:15.959
Good.

257
00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:18.292
Then you won't object
to a breathalyzer test.


258
00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:21.251
And I would like to check your car.

259
00:26:21.376 --> 00:26:22.542
That's not possible.

260
00:26:22.709 --> 00:26:23.959
Excuse me?

261
00:26:24.209 --> 00:26:25.751
Just walk away.

262
00:26:25.876 --> 00:26:27.001
Ok, that's enough.

263
00:26:27.084 --> 00:26:29.501
Turn around and put
your hands on the car.


264
00:26:29.626 --> 00:26:32.792
Hey! What will it be? This or them?

265
00:26:32.917 --> 00:26:34.459
Get back into the vehicle now!

266
00:26:34.542 --> 00:26:35.126
Back into the vehicle!

267
00:26:35.209 --> 00:26:37.126
I said turn around!

268
00:26:37.251 --> 00:26:38.292
Hey!

269
00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:46.917
Put the gun down!

270
00:26:47.001 --> 00:26:48.209
Now!

271
00:27:15.626 --> 00:27:17.709
Where are the keys?

272
00:27:19.876 --> 00:27:21.667
Are you crazy? 
We need to go.

273
00:27:21.792 --> 00:27:24.792
Wrong. We agreed that they have to go.

274
00:27:36.584 --> 00:27:39.834
Ah. You're one of those!

275
00:27:45.542 --> 00:27:47.542
Okay.

276
00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.209
No! No!

277
00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:15.126
There you go.

278
00:29:18.042 --> 00:29:20.959
Pull shit like that again,
even just once,


279
00:29:21.334 --> 00:29:24.001
and your fucking whore
daughter is history.


280
00:29:24.209 --> 00:29:26.001
Do you understand me!?

281
00:29:26.292 --> 00:29:29.042
Do you finally understand me!?

282
00:29:34.751 --> 00:29:36.792
Yes.

283
00:29:42.376 --> 00:29:45.376
Come on, give me a hand.

284
00:29:49.584 --> 00:29:51.209
Come on...

285
00:30:23.834 --> 00:30:26.709
Get in, I will be right there.

286
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:02.209
"It helps if you know how to drive!"

287
00:32:02.292 --> 00:32:04.667
Isn't that what you said?

288
00:32:19.584 --> 00:32:22.584
Look, they're waving at us.

289
00:34:27.751 --> 00:34:30.751
Ah, ah, ah. Give me that.

290
00:34:49.959 --> 00:34:51.959
What has any of this got
to do with my daughter?


291
00:34:52.042 --> 00:34:53.542
What?

292
00:34:54.834 --> 00:34:56.834
Why my daughter? Why!?

293
00:34:56.917 --> 00:34:59.917
What do you want from us!?

294
00:35:02.292 --> 00:35:05.292
Keep your calm, soldier!

295
00:35:16.501 --> 00:35:17.834
That's better.

296
00:35:19.959 --> 00:35:22.959
Some people don't know discipline.

297
00:35:25.126 --> 00:35:28.126
Or they lost it along the way.

298
00:35:33.042 --> 00:35:35.042
Speaking of...

299
00:35:40.959 --> 00:35:43.501
There are those who lead
and those who follow.


300
00:35:43.626 --> 00:35:46.626
Command and obedience.

301
00:35:47.876 --> 00:35:50.667
Some people just don't know their place.

302
00:35:50.751 --> 00:35:52.084
Can you help me?

303
00:35:52.167 --> 00:35:54.792
Mm... let me see,

304
00:35:54.917 --> 00:35:56.917
it's pretty tight, right?

305
00:35:57.084 --> 00:35:59.084
Mm...

306
00:36:02.334 --> 00:36:04.917
Strange juice you got there, Frank.

307
00:36:05.001 --> 00:36:06.126
Are you excited?

308
00:36:06.209 --> 00:36:07.501
We will be there soon.

309
00:36:07.584 --> 00:36:08.126
Yes.

310
00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:10.126
Not even sticky really.

311
00:36:10.834 --> 00:36:12.876
What are you looking forward to most?

312
00:36:12.959 --> 00:36:14.959
Daddy.

313
00:36:18.917 --> 00:36:20.709
Why me?

314
00:36:21.584 --> 00:36:23.042
Why?

315
00:36:24.626 --> 00:36:27.584
Because you're a good father, Frank.

316
00:36:27.709 --> 00:36:30.709
You just don't know it yet.

317
00:37:09.417 --> 00:37:12.334
Do you know why the
road is so bendy here?


318
00:37:12.459 --> 00:37:14.709
No.

319
00:37:14.834 --> 00:37:17.876
Because nobody is able
to drive straight anymore.


320
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:19.292
Given the chance,

321
00:37:19.376 --> 00:37:21.251
people drive themselves to death.

322
00:37:21.376 --> 00:37:23.376
Like before.

323
00:37:25.001 --> 00:37:28.626
One cross, two cross, ten cross...

324
00:37:30.959 --> 00:37:32.667
Nothing.

325
00:37:33.959 --> 00:37:37.959
You have to slow them down.
And how does one do that?


326
00:37:43.626 --> 00:37:45.626
Huh?

327
00:37:46.709 --> 00:37:47.959
With curves.

328
00:37:48.042 --> 00:37:50.501
Bingelingeling! Frank!

329
00:37:50.626 --> 00:37:53.626
You do know how to play.

330
00:37:54.126 --> 00:37:57.917
Someone who's focusing on a
curve automatically slows down


331
00:37:58.042 --> 00:38:00.751
and reaches his destination regardless.

332
00:38:00.917 --> 00:38:02.959
The right distraction at the right time.

333
00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:09.709
Believe it or not, Frank.

334
00:38:09.876 --> 00:38:11.917
Humans are like sheep,

335
00:38:12.042 --> 00:38:14.417
they need a shepherd.

336
00:38:15.084 --> 00:38:16.917
And the city?

337
00:38:17.084 --> 00:38:18.959
What would the city be then, huh?

338
00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:20.959
I don't give a shit.

339
00:38:21.959 --> 00:38:23.751
The pasture.

340
00:38:23.917 --> 00:38:26.334
The wasteland lies behind them.

341
00:38:26.459 --> 00:38:28.709
Now they have to follow to the rules.

342
00:38:28.876 --> 00:38:31.834
The accumulation of knowledge
and culture in a powerful city.


343
00:38:31.959 --> 00:38:33.917
That's the way it should be.

344
00:38:34.292 --> 00:38:35.709
And what do we see?

345
00:38:37.376 --> 00:38:40.084
No more culture, no more greatness.

346
00:38:40.417 --> 00:38:42.834
The degenerates,
the unguided are in power.


347
00:38:42.959 --> 00:38:47.084
Piss against the walls
like dogs. It's disgusting.


348
00:38:48.209 --> 00:38:51.792
There they can spend themselves stupid.

349
00:38:51.959 --> 00:38:56.542
Another piece of junk for the pigsty.
Nice and cheap. Fattening up nicely.


350
00:39:00.501 --> 00:39:03.501
The time to shear has come.

351
00:39:06.709 --> 00:39:07.292
There!

352
00:39:07.376 --> 00:39:10.376
Snap your finger one
more time and I will rip it off.


353
00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:23.709
Next exit.

354
00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:05.917
I know you don't
want to hear it, Frank,

355
00:40:06.084 --> 00:40:10.084
but we are all just tiny
cogs in a game of machines.


356
00:40:10.417 --> 00:40:12.417
You too, Frank.

357
00:40:13.126 --> 00:40:15.251
Especially you.

358
00:40:48.042 --> 00:40:49.959
Hello?

359
00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:52.209
It's me. Listen, we're running late.

360
00:40:52.292 --> 00:40:55.084
About an hour or so, something
to do with the railway switches.


361
00:40:55.209 --> 00:40:58.209
My reception is really bad.

362
00:40:59.417 --> 00:41:01.459
Are you all right?

363
00:41:01.584 --> 00:41:03.584
Yes...

364
00:41:04.084 --> 00:41:06.501
Is everything ok with you?

365
00:41:06.709 --> 00:41:07.751
Yes, yes of course.

366
00:41:08.042 --> 00:41:10.042
Okay see you soon.

367
00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:11.751
Hold on.

368
00:41:12.084 --> 00:41:14.709
Could you please
put Lily on for a second?


369
00:41:14.917 --> 00:41:16.917
Wait one moment.

370
00:41:20.834 --> 00:41:22.876
Oh she just went to the bathroom Frank.

371
00:41:23.001 --> 00:41:24.709
I see...

372
00:41:24.792 --> 00:41:27.792
We'll be there before you know it.

373
00:41:28.001 --> 00:41:29.709
Talk later.

374
00:41:31.084 --> 00:41:32.709
See you.

375
00:41:34.709 --> 00:41:36.292
Well that's good.

376
00:41:36.376 --> 00:41:39.084
No need to hurry then.

377
00:41:49.001 --> 00:41:52.001
You know how kids are.

378
00:41:52.959 --> 00:41:55.959
Don't worry about it, Frank.

379
00:42:04.959 --> 00:42:07.709
Let's stop over there.

380
00:42:17.042 --> 00:42:18.709
We're in Berlin.

381
00:42:18.834 --> 00:42:20.209
Can I go now?

382
00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:22.792
Relax.

383
00:42:23.167 --> 00:42:25.667
What else do you want from me?

384
00:42:26.792 --> 00:42:28.584
I owe you some juice.

385
00:42:28.709 --> 00:42:31.709
You don't look good at all.

386
00:42:39.209 --> 00:42:43.042
And ask for some paracetamol
or something similar.


387
00:42:53.917 --> 00:42:56.584
If we don't screw up again

388
00:42:56.709 --> 00:42:59.709
you can soon hold
little Lily in your arms.


389
00:43:00.584 --> 00:43:03.584
Just like you were supposed to.

390
00:43:43.167 --> 00:43:44.876
Hi there.

391
00:44:11.251 --> 00:44:13.042
Are you alright, brother?

392
00:44:13.334 --> 00:44:16.209
Do you have any painkillers?

393
00:44:17.459 --> 00:44:19.626
I'll go check.

394
00:45:08.917 --> 00:45:10.709
Here you go.

395
00:45:11.209 --> 00:45:13.042
Painkillers.

396
00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:15.292
You want some chai?

397
00:45:21.001 --> 00:45:23.084
What do I owe you?

398
00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:29.126
God...

399
00:45:29.709 --> 00:45:32.001
This fucking till...

400
00:45:34.792 --> 00:45:37.209
That's 6,50. These are on me.

401
00:45:37.834 --> 00:45:39.917
Keep the change.

402
00:45:40.042 --> 00:45:43.042
Why, brother? That's too much.

403
00:45:50.792 --> 00:45:52.001
Ay!

404
00:45:55.251 --> 00:45:57.834
You forgot something.

405
00:45:57.959 --> 00:46:01.042
I won't need them after all.

406
00:46:05.584 --> 00:46:07.084
We walk. You carry.

407
00:46:07.209 --> 00:46:08.584
You can get your car later.

408
00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:09.792
What's going on?

409
00:46:09.834 --> 00:46:11.834
What's going om?

410
00:46:42.834 --> 00:46:44.626
You lied to me.

411
00:46:57.459 --> 00:46:59.459
Andreas...

412
00:47:01.542 --> 00:47:03.709
You said 'take me to Berlin.'

413
00:47:04.834 --> 00:47:07.501
You said 'take me to Berlin
and everything is going to be all right!'


414
00:47:07.626 --> 00:47:08.834
Yes.

415
00:47:21.209 --> 00:47:23.167
Where were we?

416
00:47:25.334 --> 00:47:27.709
I told you to get me
to Berlin and that was it.


417
00:47:27.834 --> 00:47:29.292
You had to brake.

418
00:47:29.376 --> 00:47:30.167
You!

419
00:47:30.251 --> 00:47:31.709
Those two cops.

420
00:47:31.834 --> 00:47:33.834
You!

421
00:47:34.042 --> 00:47:37.001
The only thing that someone like
you should do is obey.


422
00:47:40.834 --> 00:47:42.709
Speaking of...

423
00:47:42.876 --> 00:47:45.501
What ever happened to those painkillers?

424
00:47:46.876 --> 00:47:48.834
Didn't have any.

425
00:48:28.709 --> 00:48:30.834
Baa, Frank,

426
00:48:30.959 --> 00:48:32.959
Baa-a...

427
00:48:39.667 --> 00:48:42.126
You're pathetic.

428
00:48:44.001 --> 00:48:45.917
Me?

429
00:48:47.126 --> 00:48:49.376
I am pathetic?

430
00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:59.667
Who do you think you are?

431
00:48:59.792 --> 00:49:03.751
Do you really think this
will round up your sheep?


432
00:49:05.167 --> 00:49:06.834
Do you really believe that?

433
00:49:06.876 --> 00:49:08.792
It doesn't matter what kind
of shit you got planned here,


434
00:49:08.834 --> 00:49:10.126
the people will hate you for it.

435
00:49:10.251 --> 00:49:12.251
They'll hate your guts!

436
00:49:12.376 --> 00:49:14.167
I sure hope so.

437
00:49:16.376 --> 00:49:19.042
Nothing of this makes any sense.

438
00:49:20.834 --> 00:49:22.167
Andreas,

439
00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:24.501
please let me go.

440
00:49:25.626 --> 00:49:28.667
Please let us go.

441
00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:32.126
Move!

442
00:49:34.751 --> 00:49:37.751
And put that thing out. 
It's disgusting.

443
00:50:10.459 --> 00:50:13.459
At least keep my family out of this.

444
00:51:01.501 --> 00:51:04.417
Leave the backpack
and put these clothes on.


445
00:51:04.542 --> 00:51:06.542
Boots, too.

446
00:51:17.792 --> 00:51:20.792
Move. We don't have all day.

447
00:51:36.792 --> 00:51:38.834
Get on with it!

448
00:52:26.542 --> 00:52:28.709
You stupid pig.

449
00:52:39.292 --> 00:52:41.834
That's it Frank.

450
00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:45.251
That's it.

451
00:52:47.792 --> 00:52:50.792
You've really done it now.

452
00:53:11.917 --> 00:53:14.917
I feel really sorry for
your daughter, Frank.


453
00:53:17.584 --> 00:53:18.001
Hello.

454
00:53:18.042 --> 00:53:19.251
Hello?

455
00:53:19.334 --> 00:53:20.959
Yes it's me.

456
00:53:22.209 --> 00:53:24.001
Zero. Four.

457
00:53:24.209 --> 00:53:25.501
Not...

458
00:53:25.584 --> 00:53:26.667
Not...

459
00:53:26.709 --> 00:53:28.751
Not my daughter.

460
00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:32.834
I'll do...

461
00:53:32.917 --> 00:53:35.042
I'll do anything.

462
00:53:35.167 --> 00:53:37.876
Please not my daughter.

463
00:53:37.959 --> 00:53:39.959
Please.

464
00:53:44.042 --> 00:53:46.917
This is your last chance, Frank.

465
00:53:49.084 --> 00:53:52.084
But only because I really like you.

466
00:55:20.501 --> 00:55:21.751
Forget the boots.

467
00:55:21.834 --> 00:55:23.917
Get over here!

468
00:56:02.917 --> 00:56:05.459
Brothers it is time to fight -

469
00:56:05.584 --> 00:56:07.917
Allah is the light-

470
00:56:08.042 --> 00:56:10.417
And we shall not falter -

471
00:56:10.542 --> 00:56:13.084
Allah is salvation -

472
00:56:13.292 --> 00:56:15.501
Once there was a kafir -

473
00:56:15.626 --> 00:56:17.876
He travelled afar to kill -

474
00:56:17.959 --> 00:56:20.042
Thoughts of leaving his guilt behind -

475
00:56:20.209 --> 00:56:22.334
But he has finally gone too far -

476
00:56:23.459 --> 00:56:25.917
To war, my brothers -

477
00:56:26.084 --> 00:56:28.417
Draw your blades -

478
00:56:28.626 --> 00:56:30.626
Steel your hearts and your arms -

479
00:56:30.709 --> 00:56:33.709
Allah will call on the best -

480
00:56:34.709 --> 00:56:37.792
Kafir, kafir, got to die -

481
00:56:37.917 --> 00:56:40.084
You know why, you know why -

482
00:56:40.209 --> 00:56:42.834
You thought you could murder brothers -

483
00:56:42.959 --> 00:56:45.917
You thought wrong,

484
00:56:46.042 --> 00:56:48.917
Punishment is upon you -

485
00:56:49.292 --> 00:56:52.001
We rise against the kafir pests -

486
00:56:52.126 --> 00:56:54.667
And burn down their cosy nests -

487
00:56:54.834 --> 00:56:57.251
Till the last kafir devil -

488
00:56:58.459 --> 00:57:01.459
Pays with his blood -

489
00:57:33.292 --> 00:57:34.834
Brothers,

490
00:57:35.084 --> 00:57:38.084
we have ourselves a special kafir here.

491
00:57:41.167 --> 00:57:45.167
A true servant of the devil
and the western infidels.


492
00:57:47.542 --> 00:57:48.709
He was...

493
00:57:49.001 --> 00:57:52.167
Not in the dark about his deeds,

494
00:57:52.292 --> 00:57:55.292
nor had anybody forced his hand.

495
00:57:55.459 --> 00:57:57.709
He has chosen evil by his own accord.

496
00:57:57.876 --> 00:57:59.626
He is a volunteer!

497
00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:02.709
A true crusader.

498
00:58:03.084 --> 00:58:05.709
Face forward, infidel.

499
00:58:05.917 --> 00:58:08.876
Face your judges!

500
00:58:10.376 --> 00:58:13.209
Frank Balzer is kneeling before you,

501
00:58:13.376 --> 00:58:17.792
born on the 4th of December 1979
in F├╝rstenwalde, Germany.


502
00:58:17.876 --> 00:58:20.584
First sergeant of the German
Special Aerial Reconnaissance


503
00:58:20.626 --> 00:58:23.501
Company 260 in Seedorf.

504
00:58:23.709 --> 00:58:28.459
This is where this kafir has
acquired the tools of his foul trade -


505
00:58:28.584 --> 00:58:31.584
cursed may he be.

506
00:58:32.917 --> 00:58:34.251
All this...

507
00:58:34.376 --> 00:58:37.459
was paid for with the blood
of our brothers and sisters.


508
00:58:37.584 --> 00:58:39.084
Murderer in the holy land

509
00:58:39.126 --> 00:58:41.542
and family man at home.

510
00:58:41.667 --> 00:58:43.626
That is the way of the West.

511
00:58:43.667 --> 00:58:45.376
A criminal and drunkard,

512
00:58:45.501 --> 00:58:47.417
who cheats on his own wife,

513
00:58:47.542 --> 00:58:51.542
while deceitfully murdering
children in foreign countries.


514
00:58:55.042 --> 00:58:57.501
Now you may turn around, kafir.

515
00:58:57.626 --> 00:58:59.209
Look at what you have done.

516
00:58:59.334 --> 00:59:01.334
Look.

517
00:59:08.417 --> 00:59:11.584
Now you look away, huh?

518
00:59:11.751 --> 00:59:13.376
But we don't.

519
00:59:13.501 --> 00:59:17.126
Because no one can
escape Allah's judgment


520
00:59:17.292 --> 00:59:19.459
and we will fulfill his holy bidding.

521
00:59:19.542 --> 00:59:21.917
(God willing)

522
00:59:27.167 --> 00:59:29.042
Tell us what you have done.

523
00:59:29.334 --> 00:59:32.334
Bear witness!

524
00:59:37.167 --> 00:59:38.667
I've got nothing to say.

525
00:59:38.917 --> 00:59:41.042
Yes, you do. You do, kafir scum!

526
00:59:41.167 --> 00:59:45.167
What happened on June 19th, 2011?

527
00:59:52.126 --> 00:59:56.126
I don't know what you are talking about.

528
00:59:56.751 --> 00:59:59.876
I am talking about the night in
which good Muslims lost their children.


529
00:59:59.959 --> 01:00:02.542
In which mothers cried
out their pain to the almighty.


530
01:00:02.667 --> 01:00:05.084
(the vulnerable Muslims)

531
01:00:05.376 --> 01:00:08.209
Cowardly burned them from afar,

532
01:00:17.376 --> 01:00:18.084
The insurgents had...

533
01:00:18.209 --> 01:00:21.209
First state your name, clearly.
And face forward.


534
01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.792
What have you done, you infidel?

535
01:00:39.084 --> 01:00:41.084
Done?

536
01:00:42.084 --> 01:00:45.042
Yes, what have you done?

537
01:00:54.209 --> 01:00:56.001
I fulfilled my mission.

538
01:00:56.126 --> 01:00:57.751
That's what I did.

539
01:00:57.876 --> 01:01:00.584
And what was your, so called, mission?

540
01:01:02.042 --> 01:01:05.876
Observation in the greater area
of Kunduz, as part of the Task Force 51.


541
01:01:06.001 --> 01:01:08.584
What is that supposed to mean?

542
01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:14.834
In June it gets really hot in Afghanistan,
at least in the greater area of Kunduz.


543
01:01:15.001 --> 01:01:19.001
Forty degrees Celsius, maybe more.
It's all right in camp, but outside -


544
01:01:30.751 --> 01:01:33.084
It started in April.

545
01:01:33.542 --> 01:01:36.917
Constant heavy attacks on
the camp and the allied hajis.


546
01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:39.209
The first to be injured in May...

547
01:01:39.709 --> 01:01:40.209
well...

548
01:01:40.334 --> 01:01:42.792
the first on our side
- injured Germans.


549
01:01:42.876 --> 01:01:44.667
Continue.

550
01:01:44.876 --> 01:01:48.876
If you've never seen combat,
you've no idea what it actually means.


551
01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:51.126
None of you get it.

552
01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:52.126
Fuck you!

553
01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:54.042
Fuck all of you!

554
01:01:54.126 --> 01:01:57.709
We have no business in that country.

555
01:01:57.876 --> 01:01:59.501
None!

556
01:01:59.667 --> 01:02:02.667
That has nothing to do with Europe.

557
01:02:04.042 --> 01:02:06.792
You're treating what's left of some
poor bastards in the camp hospital,


558
01:02:06.959 --> 01:02:10.667
guys that were injured in the
midst of collateral damage,


559
01:02:10.834 --> 01:02:13.167
and the village elder is
sitting in front of you,


560
01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:16.126
a greedy old man, no teeth and

561
01:02:16.292 --> 01:02:19.209
all he's interested in
is how much he can make


562
01:02:19.376 --> 01:02:22.876
off his dying nephew,
son, brother - whatever.


563
01:02:24.209 --> 01:02:27.084
Daughter's head got shot off?

564
01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:30.417
It's worse if a cow dies of thirst.

565
01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:35.584
If you go to this
shitty country, you either go


566
01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:37.667
with three divisions
or you don't go at all.


567
01:02:37.959 --> 01:02:39.959
The night of June 20th.

568
01:02:40.126 --> 01:02:42.876
Attacks on patrols again and again,

569
01:02:43.042 --> 01:02:45.792
RPG's hitting the camp every day,

570
01:02:45.959 --> 01:02:49.959
IED's on streets that were deemed
safe before Haji's summer holidays.


571
01:02:50.126 --> 01:02:53.126
And on June 12th things got messy.

572
01:02:54.501 --> 01:02:55.876
Boom!

573
01:02:56.001 --> 01:02:57.792
Two men dead, seven injured.

574
01:02:57.834 --> 01:02:59.042
Continue.

575
01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:00.792
Then we got the news.

576
01:03:00.959 --> 01:03:02.459
Several tankers, Pick
-Ups,

577
01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:06.042
everything they needed for
an attack on the camp, hijacked, stolen...


578
01:03:06.209 --> 01:03:07.251
Obviously the hajis...

579
01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.501
no doubt about it.

580
01:03:09.667 --> 01:03:10.709
Then?

581
01:03:10.792 --> 01:03:11.917
What happened?

582
01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:14.459
We found them,

583
01:03:14.626 --> 01:03:16.376
in the mountains...

584
01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:19.542
All of it. Camouflaged...

585
01:03:20.084 --> 01:03:22.751
The TOC wanted confirmation...

586
01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:26.084
that there were
no civilians at the scene.


587
01:03:26.209 --> 01:03:27.251
And?

588
01:03:28.584 --> 01:03:30.667
I confirmed.

589
01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:39.709
It was high time
for us to strike back.

590
01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:42.417
Otherwise the enemy
won't take us seriously.


591
01:03:42.667 --> 01:03:45.251
It's war out there, and wars are
not won by just building schools alone.


592
01:03:45.459 --> 01:03:46.209
Then what?

593
01:03:46.376 --> 01:03:48.251
What happened next?

594
01:03:48.417 --> 01:03:50.126
The Americans launched an air strike.

595
01:03:50.292 --> 01:03:52.709
We're not equipped like them.

596
01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:54.042
Two F15.

597
01:03:54.209 --> 01:03:54.917
Nice Eagles.

598
01:03:55.001 --> 01:03:57.667
You won't even see them, only hear them.

599
01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.292
Cleaned out the whole place.

600
01:03:59.376 --> 01:04:01.084
Now you may turn around and look.

601
01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:03.209
Look!

602
01:04:11.459 --> 01:04:13.542
This western crusader

603
01:04:13.709 --> 01:04:15.917
has burnt children and good Muslims.

604
01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.917
Not because he believes in a false god

605
01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:18.959
No!

606
01:04:19.084 --> 01:04:21.709
He doesn't believe in any god.

607
01:04:21.876 --> 01:04:24.876
I'm a soldier.

608
01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:30.834
You didn't even look at them,
the burnt children.


609
01:04:30.959 --> 01:04:32.917
Because you are a coward,

610
01:04:33.042 --> 01:04:36.626
a coward like all the clogs
of the West with their drones.


611
01:04:36.792 --> 01:04:38.876
That's war. Period.

612
01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:42.126
I fulfilled my mission.
I didn't give the order.


613
01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:46.834
This henchman of murderers,

614
01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:49.792
this man, who himself
has the heart of a murderer,


615
01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:53.667
today will bring the war
to where it belongs:


616
01:04:53.834 --> 01:04:56.834
his homeland.

617
01:04:59.751 --> 01:05:02.251
Frank Balzer will pay his debt.

618
01:05:02.417 --> 01:05:04.667
He will carry a bomb
to Berlin Central Station.


619
01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:06.917
He will give his pathetic life meaning,

620
01:05:07.042 --> 01:05:09.667
and for the infidels' most holy feast...

621
01:05:09.834 --> 01:05:12.334
the war will have
reached the heart of Europe.


622
01:05:12.501 --> 01:05:14.501
(In ch'allah!)

623
01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:35.501
That went rather well, don't you think?

624
01:05:56.292 --> 01:05:59.084
Can you drive?

625
01:06:08.709 --> 01:06:11.001
Here. Put that on.

626
01:06:11.126 --> 01:06:14.126
You're shivering.

627
01:06:15.167 --> 01:06:19.167
Who is supposed to believe this crap?

628
01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.584
People believe what
they want to believe, Frank.


629
01:06:21.751 --> 01:06:25.751
And unfortunately you
have to play your part.


630
01:06:32.876 --> 01:06:35.876
Are you alright?

631
01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:44.542
You tased my arse with 20k volts.

632
01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:46.751
Come on.

633
01:06:46.876 --> 01:06:48.876
Get over it.

634
01:06:57.542 --> 01:07:00.917
I'm sorry if I was a little
rough just now. I had to be.


635
01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:04.084
But you almost break my nose!

636
01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:06.292
Guess we're even then.

637
01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:08.001
Sure.

638
01:07:08.084 --> 01:07:09.584
Great.

639
01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:13.709
We'll finish this,
nice and orderly manner. Okay?


640
01:07:16.376 --> 01:07:17.251
No more bullshit.

641
01:07:17.417 --> 01:07:20.001
Just get us to Central Station.
Drop off the package.


642
01:07:20.126 --> 01:07:23.542
And your daughter can
celebrate Christmas with her mommy.


643
01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:25.001
You are insane.

644
01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:26.334
Wrong.

645
01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.542
It would be insane not to act.

646
01:07:28.667 --> 01:07:31.667
So get on with it.

647
01:07:32.417 --> 01:07:35.417
We can do this.

648
01:07:39.959 --> 01:07:40.917
Here.

649
01:07:41.042 --> 01:07:44.042
Guess it doesn't matter.

650
01:07:45.751 --> 01:07:48.751
They're in my jacket.

651
01:08:15.584 --> 01:08:17.501
Careful.

652
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:20.709
Hold still now.

653
01:09:11.626 --> 01:09:14.626
France is lost already.

654
01:09:16.876 --> 01:09:18.792
The mussies are in charge now.

655
01:09:18.876 --> 01:09:23.792
Parading their AK's on
Champs Elyse every now and again.


656
01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:27.917
Why do you think why they have
the highest birthrate in all of Europe?


657
01:09:28.167 --> 01:09:31.209
Why do you think why so many
of these children are born retarded?


658
01:09:31.626 --> 01:09:33.751
Who is fat, stupid, lazy
and can't even walk straight...


659
01:09:33.876 --> 01:09:36.792
Who gets his arse wiped till they're eighteen
and still throws his weight around?


660
01:09:36.876 --> 01:09:38.209
Who?

661
01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:44.709
Who!?

662
01:09:44.876 --> 01:09:47.709
What do I know...

663
01:09:47.876 --> 01:09:50.876
Ramadan-brats.

664
01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:54.876
It has all been written
in Black and white.


665
01:09:55.042 --> 01:09:56.876
In a natural world, in a...

666
01:09:57.001 --> 01:10:00.334
good world, they wouldn't
even be able to survive.


667
01:10:00.917 --> 01:10:04.667
We force feed them in our civilization.

668
01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:06.251
That we have been forging
for a thousand years...


669
01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:09.417
A fucking thousand years!

670
01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:13.251
By the sweat of our brows.

671
01:10:18.917 --> 01:10:21.917
Tell me I'm wrong. 
Go on, tell me!

672
01:10:33.334 --> 01:10:36.876
It makes me want to throw up
seeing this misery every day.


673
01:10:37.042 --> 01:10:40.626
We've been walking around with our
heads bowed for the past seventy years.


674
01:10:40.751 --> 01:10:45.751
And the American Jew sets
the pace, with a nigger in office.


675
01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:47.792
That's just sick!

676
01:10:47.917 --> 01:10:50.917
So that's what you call sick?

677
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:54.709
Come on, don't pretend.

678
01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:57.876
You feel it, too. 
Something's off.

679
01:10:58.209 --> 01:11:00.042
We're the fucking frog,

680
01:11:00.209 --> 01:11:02.626
sitting in a pot of water
that keeps getting hotter.


681
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:03.959
And we don't even realize it.

682
01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:08.376
The poison of Islam is already
running through our veins,


683
01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:12.542
You got a whole different poison
running through your veins.


684
01:11:13.917 --> 01:11:15.917
Hmph... Yeah.

685
01:11:19.834 --> 01:11:22.584
That's what you think.

686
01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:25.667
But you'll see soon enough...

687
01:11:25.834 --> 01:11:26.876
Well.

688
01:11:26.959 --> 01:11:29.501
Not you, I guess...

689
01:11:59.876 --> 01:12:02.584
Believe me, that will soon be over.

690
01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:06.751
Then those lowlifes won't dare
to look a German in the eye.


691
01:12:08.084 --> 01:12:10.667
I mean, is that what's it come to?

692
01:12:10.834 --> 01:12:13.084
I have to kowtow in my own country?

693
01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:14.709
You have to kowtow...

694
01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:17.626
just because you're
proud of your heritage!?


695
01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:20.834
Show me one other country
like that. Just one, Frank!


696
01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:24.001
Simpletons at the pub must love you.

697
01:12:27.792 --> 01:12:29.792
Absolutely.

698
01:12:30.542 --> 01:12:33.542
And who is there
with me in that pub?

699
01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:39.917
The ordinary guy,

700
01:12:40.042 --> 01:12:42.417
who is fed up with taking a beating...

701
01:12:42.584 --> 01:12:44.584
each time he says
what's wrong with this country.


702
01:12:44.667 --> 01:12:48.167
When he stands up for himself.

703
01:12:48.334 --> 01:12:50.042
And this little fella...

704
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:51.417
is weak,

705
01:12:51.501 --> 01:12:52.626
weary,

706
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:54.126
fast asleep.

707
01:12:54.417 --> 01:12:57.876
He wants to wake up,
but he can't do it on his own.


708
01:12:58.042 --> 01:13:00.042
He needs a spark of inspiration.

709
01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.167
And you, Frank,

710
01:13:02.417 --> 01:13:05.667
you will have too ignite that spark.

711
01:13:05.834 --> 01:13:08.084
Believe me, these fucking
jackrabbits want to spread everywhere


712
01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:09.626
until we are extinct.

713
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:10.834
That's what it's all about!

714
01:13:10.917 --> 01:13:12.584
The Arabs have a plan!

715
01:13:12.834 --> 01:13:14.001
If they could,

716
01:13:14.126 --> 01:13:15.501
they would...

717
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:18.042
But we won't let him.

718
01:13:18.209 --> 01:13:21.001
We're just anticipating this attack!

719
01:13:21.042 --> 01:13:24.459
At a time when our race
still has enough power!


720
01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:26.792
To rise like a man!

721
01:13:26.959 --> 01:13:28.751
To fight back!

722
01:13:28.834 --> 01:13:30.709
To break our chains!

723
01:13:30.792 --> 01:13:33.792
To strike back!

724
01:13:44.001 --> 01:13:45.667
When even the most cool-headed German

725
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:48.292
and the German
is stoic by nature


726
01:13:48.459 --> 01:13:49.834
finally realizes...

727
01:13:50.001 --> 01:13:52.876
What pest is polluting
the atmosphere in his country,


728
01:13:53.001 --> 01:13:55.001
lurking in the dark, waiting to fulfill

729
01:13:55.042 --> 01:13:57.459
their mullahs' and hatemongers' commands,

730
01:13:57.542 --> 01:13:58.834
then, my friend,

731
01:13:58.876 --> 01:14:01.292
these streets will burn.

732
01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:04.251
You know best what I'm talking about.

733
01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:07.542
I don't think so.

734
01:14:07.751 --> 01:14:08.959
Yes...

735
01:14:09.084 --> 01:14:10.959
You do!

736
01:14:11.126 --> 01:14:13.709
You of all people should be proud.

737
01:14:13.876 --> 01:14:14.834
Should I...?

738
01:14:14.876 --> 01:14:17.667
Yes! Yes!

739
01:14:17.834 --> 01:14:22.834
After all, you have burned
an entire village to ashes.


740
01:14:23.001 --> 01:14:26.001
You know nothing...

741
01:14:26.751 --> 01:14:28.042
Oh,

742
01:14:28.209 --> 01:14:30.376
but I do!

743
01:14:30.584 --> 01:14:33.584
To me you're a hero.

744
01:14:33.751 --> 01:14:36.876
And soon the people will rise. United.

745
01:14:37.042 --> 01:14:40.626
And once again there will be
a Germany we can be proud of.


746
01:14:40.792 --> 01:14:44.501
A Germany, that doesn't
kowtow to American finance.


747
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:47.709
A Germany that spurns the
madness that promises we are all equal!


748
01:14:48.001 --> 01:14:49.251
It is our duty
to wake the German people,

749
01:14:49.334 --> 01:14:53.501
to forge them together
in this hour of darkness.


750
01:14:54.042 --> 01:14:57.042
If we don't act today.

751
01:14:58.167 --> 01:15:01.167
Tomorrow, it will be too late.

752
01:15:17.751 --> 01:15:22.376
I know, many think this country is already
too intermingled, too diluted to rise up.


753
01:15:22.542 --> 01:15:24.251
Totally wrong.

754
01:15:24.959 --> 01:15:26.959
The plebeian, the arab-lovers,

755
01:15:27.126 --> 01:15:28.126
the do-gooders,

756
01:15:28.209 --> 01:15:30.459
until now have had the biggest mouths.

757
01:15:30.584 --> 01:15:33.584
But we will shut them up, Frank!

758
01:15:44.834 --> 01:15:47.126
Of course, it's hard, Frank.

759
01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:51.626
But rest assured that your sacrifice
will be for a higher, a greater cause.


760
01:15:51.876 --> 01:15:54.417
Not in vain in Afghanistan.

761
01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:56.834
But here at home,

762
01:15:56.959 --> 01:15:59.917
in your beloved country.

763
01:16:00.084 --> 01:16:03.084
Which we both love.

764
01:16:52.917 --> 01:16:55.709
You're going to be a martyr, Frank.

765
01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:58.876
For your daughter's future.

766
01:17:06.376 --> 01:17:09.376
You'll walk to the
Christmas tree over there.


767
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:10.917
Just flip the switch.

768
01:17:11.042 --> 01:17:13.126
That's it.

769
01:17:20.834 --> 01:17:21.792
Here.

770
01:17:21.876 --> 01:17:24.876
In case you run out of courage.

771
01:17:32.584 --> 01:17:35.584
They're at Berlin
East Station now. It's time.


772
01:17:38.376 --> 01:17:39.709
The stream is still up if you...

773
01:17:39.792 --> 01:17:41.792
No.

774
01:17:42.417 --> 01:17:44.126
No.

775
01:17:46.084 --> 01:17:49.084
Listen to me Frank.

776
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:52.917
I can assure you that
your daughter will be safe.


777
01:19:08.501 --> 01:19:11.501
Think about Lily.

778
01:20:00.209 --> 01:20:02.126
You made one mistake,

779
01:20:02.334 --> 01:20:05.209
you dirty piece of shit!

780
01:20:05.459 --> 01:20:07.292
I did not hide!

781
01:20:07.459 --> 01:20:08.709
I did see them!

782
01:20:08.792 --> 01:20:10.292
I saw them all!

783
01:20:10.459 --> 01:20:11.834
You hear me!?

784
01:20:11.917 --> 01:20:13.834
Their screams, their pain.

785
01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:15.917
I have seen it all!

786
01:20:16.042 --> 01:20:17.251
Everything!

787
01:20:17.376 --> 01:20:18.792
And they're with me.

788
01:20:18.876 --> 01:20:20.709
Every night, every day.

789
01:20:20.834 --> 01:20:23.001
Now in this moment. 
They're all here!

790
01:20:23.167 --> 01:20:24.751
They're all here!

791
01:20:24.834 --> 01:20:26.876
There is no one else. No one!

792
01:20:26.959 --> 01:20:28.584
I have lost everything!

793
01:20:28.667 --> 01:20:30.001
Nothing is left.

794
01:20:30.084 --> 01:20:33.501
It smells of burning flesh.
Even days later.


795
01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:36.292
It feels like somebody is pouring
gasoline down your nose.


796
01:20:36.417 --> 01:20:37.709
You can shower all you want.

797
01:20:37.709 --> 01:20:38.126
But it

798
01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:38.667
does

799
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:39.167
not

800
01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:41.209
come off!

801
01:20:42.959 --> 01:20:44.251
What do you think?

802
01:20:44.376 --> 01:20:47.542
How long does such
a little body stay alive?


803
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:48.876
They're already dead.

804
01:20:48.959 --> 01:20:51.876
They just don't know it yet.

805
01:20:52.042 --> 01:20:55.084
They have no arms, no legs...

806
01:20:55.834 --> 01:20:57.626
Every inch of their body is burnt.

807
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:59.542
But they keep breathing.

808
01:20:59.626 --> 01:21:03.626
Going between the trucks with
trash bags, collecting the remains.


809
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:05.042
That's what's left.

810
01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:07.709
A bag of char-coaled junk.

811
01:24:17.751 --> 01:24:20.751
Do it.

812
01:24:27.209 --> 01:24:29.209
Flip it.

813
01:24:29.917 --> 01:24:31.876
Flip it.

814
01:24:35.667 --> 01:24:38.584
That's what I thought.

815
01:25:21.376 --> 01:25:24.084
This can't be happening.

816
01:25:27.834 --> 01:25:29.792
And... What are we going to do now?

817
01:25:29.876 --> 01:25:30.584
Eat something?

818
01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:32.667
Yes!

819
01:25:34.834 --> 01:25:37.709
You have two new messages.

820
01:25:37.876 --> 01:25:39.834
Here are your new messages.

821
01:25:39.917 --> 01:25:41.917
<i>Hi, it's Frank.</i>

822
01:25:42.501 --> 01:25:44.167
<i>You know...</i>

823
01:25:44.667 --> 01:25:46.667
<i>Shit, I'll never...</i>

824
01:25:46.834 --> 01:25:49.584
<i>I tried. I really did.</i>

825
01:25:51.126 --> 01:25:53.542
<i>Whatever happens today...</i>

826
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:55.292
<i>at Central Station...</i>

827
01:25:55.459 --> 01:25:57.959
<i>People will talk.</i>

828
01:25:58.126 --> 01:26:00.709
<i>But you know me.</i>

829
01:26:00.876 --> 01:26:03.876
<i>Don't believe what they say.</i>

830
01:26:04.042 --> 01:26:07.084
<i>Lily means everything to me.</i>

831
01:26:07.917 --> 01:26:11.542
<i>Do you remember that cave on Mallorca?</i>

832
01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:15.084
<i>I always wanted to...</i>

833
01:26:15.667 --> 01:26:18.667
<i>Please take her.</i>

834
01:26:19.834 --> 01:26:22.834
<i>I have to go.</i>

835
01:26:23.209 --> 01:26:25.584
Your message has been saved.

836
01:26:25.709 --> 01:26:28.709
Next message.

837
01:26:29.792 --> 01:26:32.251
