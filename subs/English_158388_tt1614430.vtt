1
00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:48.852
The roar of Hurricane Charley

2
00:00:48.952 --> 00:00:50.654
is tearing towards
the Florida coast.


3
00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:55.526
We have reports from the National
Hurricane Center of 15 foot waves.


4
00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:01.999
Others are staying put...

5
00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:04.502
People are preparing
to hunker down,


6
00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:07.571
bracing for what could be
devastating winds.


7
00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:13.744
But if you are going
to leave, leave now.


8
00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:15.813
The latest update
from the Hurricane Center


9
00:01:15.913 --> 00:01:19.149
puts Charley on a fast
track for the Tampa area.


10
00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:38.869
We have heard reports of

11
00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.105
extremely long lines
at gas stations,


12
00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:45.543
and we do know that many
are running low on fuel.


13
00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:54.251
Bracing for what could be
devastating winds.


14
00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:05.062
The emergency workers of this area are
designating Red Cross and Salvation Army...


15
00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:09.499
I-4 and I-75 at this time
are clear.


16
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.869
Now, you shouldn't get
too secure with that


17
00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.805
because, you know,
as this progresses


18
00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:18.542
those, uh, roads are going
to get very, very busy.


19
00:02:18.642 --> 00:02:19.810
My suggestion...

20
00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:25.515
Okay.

21
00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:27.193
Let's put all this stuff in
as fast as we can,


22
00:02:27.217 --> 00:02:29.019
before it starts
coming down, all right?


23
00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.854
Okay.

24
00:02:30.954 --> 00:02:32.222
Hey, Zach.

25
00:02:32.322 --> 00:02:33.891
My mom's all freaked.

26
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.526
We're evacuating to
my uncle's in Huntsville.


27
00:02:36.627 --> 00:02:38.796
I wanna stay here.
It might be cool, you know?


28
00:02:38.896 --> 00:02:40.964
Yeah, well, we're staying.

29
00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:42.733
- You're not evacuating?
- No.


30
00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.902
I'd rather be in our
safe room in my own home,


31
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.104
than stuck on the highway
with a million other folks.


32
00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:48.906
We sat out a half dozen
of these things.


33
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:50.908
Mandatory evacuation orders

34
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:53.176
have been issued for all
residents of the Florida Keys


35
00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:55.913
and people are packing up
and heading to the mainland.


36
00:02:56.013 --> 00:02:58.949
Thousands of cars, many towing
boats crammed the highway...


37
00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.651
What now?

38
00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:04.054
We wait it out.

39
00:03:04.154 --> 00:03:06.023
Latest update from
the Hurricane Center


40
00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:09.793
puts Charley on a fast track
for the Tampa area.


41
00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:11.595
Though they do caution

42
00:03:11.695 --> 00:03:13.664
that it wouldn't take much
to force a deviation


43
00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:15.799
anywhere along that trajectory.

44
00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.901
Extremely long lines
at gas stations.


45
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:22.205
And we do know that many
are running low on fuel.


46
00:04:02.746 --> 00:04:05.348
There's a staggering number
of people left homeless.


47
00:04:05.448 --> 00:04:07.050
Shelters are packed...

48
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:10.120
Feeding them is no easy task.

49
00:04:10.153 --> 00:04:12.598
The volunteers are doing the best
they can with the supplies they have.


50
00:04:12.622 --> 00:04:13.933
Punta Gorda airport
has been leveled.


51
00:04:13.957 --> 00:04:16.894
Hurricane Charley made
a last minute right turn,


52
00:04:16.994 --> 00:04:20.397
veering 70 miles
to the south of Tampa Bay.


53
00:04:20.497 --> 00:04:23.901
The communities around Punta
Gorda and Port Charlotte


54
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:25.402
saw the worst of it.

55
00:04:25.502 --> 00:04:28.038
So far 16 people are dead.
What's going on?


56
00:04:28.138 --> 00:04:30.040
Just another day in paradise.

57
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.942
Hundreds are missing.

58
00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:33.643
When it comes to homes

59
00:04:33.744 --> 00:04:35.746
at least 3,000
conventional homes


60
00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:38.882
and 9,000 mobile homes
are destroyed.


61
00:04:39.983 --> 00:04:42.652
At least 20,000 people
are homeless


62
00:04:42.753 --> 00:04:44.387
and thousands are trying to find

63
00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:47.691
food and water
in the merciless heat.


64
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:51.061
One relief worker described
it to me as organized chaos.


65
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:54.097
There are so many needs out
there for people right now,


66
00:04:54.197 --> 00:04:58.301
and patience and provisions
are both in short supply.


67
00:04:58.401 --> 00:05:03.774
What these people want, need
desperately is ice and clean water.


68
00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:07.044
The American Red Cross and
other disaster relief agencies


69
00:05:07.144 --> 00:05:10.047
are setting up collection
points across Florida.


70
00:05:10.147 --> 00:05:12.783
If you'd like to help,
you can take your donations


71
00:05:12.883 --> 00:05:17.454
to any one of the locations scrolling
at the bottom of your screen.


72
00:05:17.554 --> 00:05:19.923
We should give them
some of the water we got.


73
00:05:20.023 --> 00:05:21.324
Oh, we could do that.

74
00:05:21.424 --> 00:05:23.193
Zach, please wash up.

75
00:05:23.293 --> 00:05:26.163
I'll bet everybody in the neighborhood
has lots of water like us.


76
00:05:26.263 --> 00:05:28.431
Tons of emergency stuff, too.

77
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:31.034
I should go around and ask
them if they want to donate...


78
00:05:31.134 --> 00:05:32.335
Well, I wouldn't do it.

79
00:05:32.435 --> 00:05:34.938
Right now
people are off to work.


80
00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:37.207
Why don't you
give them some notice?


81
00:05:37.307 --> 00:05:39.209
Collect it on Saturday.

82
00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:40.911
People work on Saturday, too.

83
00:05:42.312 --> 00:05:44.214
You could make flyers.

84
00:05:44.314 --> 00:05:47.851
Tell them to sit stuff out on
the porch if they're not home.


85
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:49.719
Yeah, you should
help him with that, Kel.


86
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.055
I'm busy.
You're busy?


87
00:05:52.155 --> 00:05:53.423
Come on, help him out.

88
00:05:53.523 --> 00:05:55.368
You two kids don't do
anything together anymore.


89
00:05:55.392 --> 00:05:58.195
I'm not a kid anymore,
in case you haven't noticed.


90
00:05:58.295 --> 00:05:59.729
Hey, Mom, Kelley.

91
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.365
Where's that list of
emergency supplies we had?


92
00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:06.136
We can put it on the flyers,
so people know what's needed.


93
00:06:06.236 --> 00:06:07.838
Zach, hands.

94
00:06:07.938 --> 00:06:09.372
Wash 'em. Now.

95
00:06:59.422 --> 00:07:01.358
Kelley, come on.
Let's do this.


96
00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:04.394
Hey, Zach. You wanna
play some Horse?


97
00:07:04.494 --> 00:07:06.864
Uh, I gotta go pick up
the hurricane stuff first,


98
00:07:06.964 --> 00:07:09.232
but it won't take long.
So after, okay?


99
00:07:09.332 --> 00:07:10.367
Your loss, dude.

100
00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:12.002
Cool. Kelley!

101
00:07:12.102 --> 00:07:14.437
Right here.
Let's do this.


102
00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:16.006
Brenda and I are
going to the mall.


103
00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:17.540
Oh, no. No, I'm
sorry, you're not.


104
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.218
You gotta keep an eye
on your little brother


105
00:07:19.242 --> 00:07:20.402
while I go check my property.

106
00:07:20.477 --> 00:07:21.912
Good luck.

107
00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:57.047
Wha...
Kelley, look at this!


108
00:07:57.147 --> 00:08:00.517
Oh, my gosh. This is so cool.
I hit the jackpot.


109
00:08:00.617 --> 00:08:02.986
Yeah, over here, too.

110
00:08:06.489 --> 00:08:08.591
Hey, what did you find?

111
00:08:42.592 --> 00:08:44.261
Wow. Look at all that.

112
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:46.163
Good for you.

113
00:08:46.263 --> 00:08:47.998
You know, it's pretty
hot out here.


114
00:08:48.098 --> 00:08:49.508
Maybe you shouldn't
leave that in the sun.


115
00:08:49.532 --> 00:08:51.534
Why don't you, uh,
load up the van,


116
00:08:51.634 --> 00:08:53.679
I'll change and then we can go
right over to the collection center.


117
00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:56.006
That's not all, Mom.

118
00:08:56.106 --> 00:08:57.140
What do you mean?

119
00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.341
Hit the remote.

120
00:08:58.441 --> 00:08:59.676
Okay.

121
00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:17.527
Okay.

122
00:09:17.627 --> 00:09:21.564
We are going to have
to make more than one trip.


123
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.239
Hey! Hey!

124
00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:31.608
Look who's here with another load.
It's the Z-Man.


125
00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:32.976
What's up, dude?

126
00:09:33.076 --> 00:09:34.411
Good to see you.
You, too.


127
00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:36.579
Thanks, son. You're picking
the cupboards bare, huh?


128
00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:38.181
How many loads is that?
Uh...


129
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:39.625
Oh, I want you to meet
a friend of mine.


130
00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:41.518
This is Ashley Legare,
a reporter.


131
00:09:41.618 --> 00:09:43.320
Hi. Nice to meet you.

132
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.055
So, young man,

133
00:09:45.155 --> 00:09:47.166
I hear you're personally
responsible for bringing in


134
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.592
two truckloads
of relief supplies?


135
00:09:49.692 --> 00:09:51.594
Well, actually three.

136
00:09:51.694 --> 00:09:53.196
But my mom and my sister helped.

137
00:09:53.296 --> 00:09:56.066
Excuse me, what...
What's going on?


138
00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:58.201
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're with Channel 5.


139
00:09:58.301 --> 00:09:59.469
Are you his mother?

140
00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:01.071
Yes.

141
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.381
Well, we thought it would
be nice to do an interview


142
00:10:02.405 --> 00:10:03.740
about you and your family

143
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.575
and all the good work
you're doing here.


144
00:10:06.576 --> 00:10:08.078
Um, well...

145
00:10:09.346 --> 00:10:11.014
It was Zach's idea.

146
00:10:11.114 --> 00:10:12.982
So, you know, you
should just talk to him.


147
00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:16.219
All right.

148
00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:18.988
Okay. Where you
wanna do this?


149
00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:21.158
Well, how did
all of this get started?


150
00:10:21.258 --> 00:10:24.761
Well, we were watching
the news one day, I guess,


151
00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:27.764
and how it missed us,
Hurricane Charley.


152
00:10:27.864 --> 00:10:32.235
So, I was thinking of all
those people in Punta Gorda.


153
00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:33.770
You know, they lost like

154
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.672
everything.

155
00:10:35.772 --> 00:10:39.042
So, we made flyers and I
got my little red wagon.


156
00:10:39.142 --> 00:10:41.644
This wagon my mom got me
when I was little.


157
00:10:41.744 --> 00:10:43.513
You know?

158
00:10:43.613 --> 00:10:46.149
So, people just...
There was...


159
00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:48.785
There was donations
and we brought them here.


160
00:10:50.587 --> 00:10:52.655
Three truckloads,

161
00:10:52.755 --> 00:10:55.458
and he's not done yet,
says young Zach Bonner.


162
00:10:55.558 --> 00:10:58.628
Oh, I can't watch it.
I acted like a dumb kid.


163
00:10:58.728 --> 00:11:00.797
That's okay.
You are a kid.


164
00:11:00.897 --> 00:11:04.234
- As for the dumb part...
- Kelley.


165
00:11:04.334 --> 00:11:05.802
It's still good, Zach.

166
00:11:05.902 --> 00:11:07.713
People see you on TV, they
might give you more stuff.


167
00:11:07.737 --> 00:11:09.806
Yeah. That'd be cool.

168
00:11:09.906 --> 00:11:12.142
Uh, I don't know about that.

169
00:11:12.242 --> 00:11:14.577
I think you pretty much
played out the neighborhood.


170
00:11:14.677 --> 00:11:16.679
Yeah, you're right.

171
00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:21.184
But we could do other
neighborhoods around here.


172
00:11:21.284 --> 00:11:23.353
Come on, let's go
make some more flyers.


173
00:11:23.453 --> 00:11:25.322
Mom.

174
00:11:25.422 --> 00:11:27.190
I do not have time to go

175
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.160
traipsing after him
all over Florida.


176
00:11:31.828 --> 00:11:34.231
I have a life, you know!

177
00:11:39.136 --> 00:11:42.305
Let me see.
Where did I put that box?


178
00:11:42.405 --> 00:11:43.673
Here it is.

179
00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:45.642
Do I really have to
get rid of all this stuff?


180
00:11:45.742 --> 00:11:47.810
I told you, you can only
take half that stuff.


181
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.712
There won't be room
in the apartment.


182
00:11:49.812 --> 00:11:51.548
Thank you very much.

183
00:11:51.648 --> 00:11:54.117
Oh. Hey, hold on! I have
some more stuff for you.


184
00:11:57.454 --> 00:11:59.189
I've got this water purifier.

185
00:11:59.289 --> 00:12:01.858
My husband got it for
our camping trip together.


186
00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.161
I'm sure someone could
find some use for it.


187
00:12:04.261 --> 00:12:05.862
Sure, I guess.

188
00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:08.131
Oh! Don't you
just hate moving?


189
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:09.632
Oh, I hate it.

190
00:12:09.732 --> 00:12:11.434
And we're moving
to a smaller place.


191
00:12:11.534 --> 00:12:14.271
House load of stuff in a tiny apartment.
I don't know.


192
00:12:14.371 --> 00:12:17.507
I bet you some of those hurricane
kids would like a Rock Band.


193
00:12:17.607 --> 00:12:20.477
Oh, for sure.
Here, take the box.


194
00:12:20.577 --> 00:12:21.611
Thanks.

195
00:12:21.711 --> 00:12:24.581
Wait. Not that.

196
00:12:24.681 --> 00:12:26.115
My dad gave me that.

197
00:12:29.886 --> 00:12:32.222
I have a tent.

198
00:12:32.322 --> 00:12:34.224
That would be handy,
wouldn't it?


199
00:12:34.324 --> 00:12:35.492
Uh, yeah.

200
00:12:36.626 --> 00:12:38.437
Those poor people. I hear
some of them lost everything.


201
00:12:38.461 --> 00:12:40.363
Oh, they sure did.

202
00:12:41.564 --> 00:12:43.766
Tell your husband get a checkup.

203
00:12:43.866 --> 00:12:45.468
Well, it's just me
and my two kids.


204
00:12:45.568 --> 00:12:47.204
Uh, lost my husband.

205
00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:50.640
Motorcycle accident.

206
00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:54.277
Cancer. Six months ago.

207
00:12:56.646 --> 00:12:58.415
I'm... I'm sorry.

208
00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:05.622
So you manage with no,
uh, father in the house?


209
00:13:05.722 --> 00:13:07.924
Um, yeah.
I mean, we get by.


210
00:13:08.024 --> 00:13:12.262
I'm in real estate and I
manage some property, so...


211
00:13:12.362 --> 00:13:14.231
We do okay.

212
00:13:17.334 --> 00:13:19.902
Well, get a checkup.

213
00:13:20.002 --> 00:13:23.172
My late husband, he, uh...

214
00:13:23.273 --> 00:13:25.753
Well, you never know you're gonna
get sick until it's too late.


215
00:13:25.808 --> 00:13:27.277
Right?

216
00:13:27.377 --> 00:13:29.679
Um, this is very generous.

217
00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:30.813
I appreciate it.

218
00:13:30.913 --> 00:13:32.482
Oh, it's my pleasure.

219
00:13:32.582 --> 00:13:34.751
Well, we better get going, Zach.
Okay? Okay.


220
00:13:34.851 --> 00:13:36.453
Again, thank you so much.

221
00:13:36.553 --> 00:13:37.754
Okay.

222
00:13:38.555 --> 00:13:39.789
Good luck.

223
00:13:40.557 --> 00:13:42.325
Good luck to you.

224
00:13:52.835 --> 00:13:54.271
Well, you can't be doing that.

225
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:55.572
You gotta wait in the car.

226
00:13:55.672 --> 00:13:56.839
Huh?

227
00:13:56.939 --> 00:13:59.342
Where's Mr. Parrish?
Never heard of him.


228
00:13:59.442 --> 00:14:01.644
You gotta sit in the car.

229
00:14:01.744 --> 00:14:04.581
No minors allowed
around the loading dock.


230
00:14:04.681 --> 00:14:05.715
Mom.

231
00:14:05.815 --> 00:14:07.784
Excuse me, what's going on here?

232
00:14:07.884 --> 00:14:10.620
No kids around the loading dock.
It's the rules.


233
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.889
But Zach's helped unload before.

234
00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:14.657
I don't care about that.

235
00:14:14.757 --> 00:14:15.825
Lady.

236
00:14:15.925 --> 00:14:18.661
He's brought in 27
freaking loads here.


237
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:21.464
Helped unload 26 of them
his own self.


238
00:14:21.564 --> 00:14:23.533
I don't make the rules, lady.

239
00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:25.001
I just enforce them.

240
00:14:25.101 --> 00:14:27.504
That is just the most ridicu...

241
00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:32.375
But it's the rules.

242
00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:36.346
It's the rules, so...
Go wait in the van, Zach.


243
00:14:36.446 --> 00:14:38.481
Kelley, you and I will
unload the rest of this.


244
00:14:40.517 --> 00:14:42.018
That uptight,

245
00:14:42.118 --> 00:14:44.454
anal-retentive bureaucrat.

246
00:14:44.554 --> 00:14:46.599
You give little people a
little power and you just...


247
00:14:46.623 --> 00:14:48.791
Okay. All right, all right.

248
00:14:50.493 --> 00:14:51.861
Zach, you okay?

249
00:14:54.697 --> 00:14:58.401
Come on. Are you gonna let
Princess Red Tape ruin your day?


250
00:14:58.501 --> 00:15:02.505
You've been doing a good thing.

251
00:15:02.605 --> 00:15:06.376
Is it 'cause you didn't get a high-five
and a great big attaboy from Mr. Parrish?


252
00:15:06.476 --> 00:15:09.946
'Cause you didn't get
to be on TV again?


253
00:15:10.046 --> 00:15:12.849
Is that why you've
been doing this?


254
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.390
You know what? We're
gonna go on a road trip.


255
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.393
Wait. What?

256
00:15:23.493 --> 00:15:25.862
Where? Right now? All
right, just calm down.


257
00:15:25.962 --> 00:15:27.330
You'll see.

258
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.066
No! I can't go anywhere,
I gotta go home.


259
00:15:30.166 --> 00:15:31.934
Why?
I have a date.


260
00:15:32.034 --> 00:15:33.370
Oh.

261
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.805
A date? With who?
That Murch kid again?


262
00:15:35.905 --> 00:15:37.507
What? Uh...

263
00:15:37.607 --> 00:15:40.076
Somebody else. I already told you.
Oh.


264
00:15:40.176 --> 00:15:42.011
But he's picking me up
in, like, an hour


265
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:45.348
and I have to go home and get ready.
Okay, okay.


266
00:15:45.448 --> 00:15:48.385
Then it'll just be Zach and me.
Yes.


267
00:15:48.951 --> 00:15:50.887
Road trip, Zach?

268
00:15:54.757 --> 00:15:55.825
Yeah?

269
00:15:55.925 --> 00:15:57.427
Okay.

270
00:16:08.805 --> 00:16:11.408
Come over here
for a second, please.


271
00:16:19.416 --> 00:16:23.586
I thought you should see where all
that stuff you collected was going.


272
00:16:25.988 --> 00:16:29.358
Some of these folks
have been here for weeks.


273
00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:31.694
Can you believe that?

274
00:16:31.794 --> 00:16:35.432
But they are being fed,
clothed, taken care of.


275
00:16:35.532 --> 00:16:39.502
But people like you, if you
hadn't done what you did,


276
00:16:39.602 --> 00:16:42.038
it would have been
a whole lot worse for them.


277
00:16:42.905 --> 00:16:44.641
It's so...

278
00:16:45.742 --> 00:16:47.477
So...
I know.


279
00:16:48.645 --> 00:16:50.079
Breaks your heart.

280
00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:52.381
From one day you're just
living your life and then...


281
00:16:52.482 --> 00:16:53.816
Bam! Something happens.

282
00:16:53.916 --> 00:16:56.419
And the next thing
you know you're...


283
00:16:56.519 --> 00:16:59.522
You're struggling with things
that you always took for granted.


284
00:16:59.622 --> 00:17:02.892
How am I gonna feed my kids?

285
00:17:02.992 --> 00:17:04.994
Put clothes on their back,

286
00:17:05.094 --> 00:17:07.797
roof over their heads.

287
00:17:07.897 --> 00:17:09.566
It's just the simplest,

288
00:17:09.666 --> 00:17:14.704
little thing can become a
mountain that you have to climb.


289
00:17:15.638 --> 00:17:16.906
Hey.

290
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.675
Hi.

291
00:17:18.775 --> 00:17:20.477
I have my own room.

292
00:17:21.043 --> 00:17:22.545
Where's your home?

293
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.081
Ain't there no more.

294
00:17:26.916 --> 00:17:28.518
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:38.895 --> 00:17:42.164
Can I get a new memory card
for my Battle Box?


296
00:17:43.566 --> 00:17:47.036
We're not gonna buy anything new.
Not for a while.


297
00:17:47.837 --> 00:17:49.872
I lost my job today.

298
00:17:49.972 --> 00:17:51.140
You got fired?

299
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.910
No. They closed the bank.

300
00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.445
You know, my manager
came in this morning


301
00:17:56.546 --> 00:17:59.066
and said that they would cease
operations by the end of the day.


302
00:17:59.148 --> 00:18:00.483
And then,
they just shut it down.


303
00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:02.051
I mean, the whole branch.

304
00:18:02.151 --> 00:18:04.621
Locked everything up
and sent us all home.


305
00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:05.822
You'll get another job.

306
00:18:05.922 --> 00:18:07.056
Hmm?

307
00:18:07.156 --> 00:18:08.825
You'll get another job.

308
00:18:08.925 --> 00:18:10.660
I will.

309
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.695
Absolutely. I will.

310
00:18:28.578 --> 00:18:29.846
Ooh.

311
00:18:29.946 --> 00:18:33.149
Hey, made curfew
with time to spare.


312
00:18:33.249 --> 00:18:35.718
Give Kelley an "attagirl".

313
00:18:35.818 --> 00:18:38.521
For doing what
you're supposed to do?


314
00:18:48.765 --> 00:18:50.967
Now what's the gnome doing?

315
00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:54.270
I took him to see some of
the folks he's been helping.


316
00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.774
A bunch of people made
homeless by the hurricanes.


317
00:18:58.941 --> 00:19:00.710
Seems he took it to heart.

318
00:19:01.611 --> 00:19:02.779
Yeah.

319
00:19:09.719 --> 00:19:11.153
He does that.

320
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.632
So...

321
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.602
How was your date?

322
00:19:25.702 --> 00:19:26.969
So...

323
00:19:27.069 --> 00:19:30.039
His name is Ian. And...

324
00:19:31.774 --> 00:19:32.975
I don't know.

325
00:19:33.075 --> 00:19:35.177
He's super cute.

326
00:19:35.277 --> 00:19:39.782
We like the same books
and movies and music and...


327
00:19:40.917 --> 00:19:43.552
I don't know.

328
00:19:43.653 --> 00:19:46.723
I gotta call Brenda.

329
00:19:46.823 --> 00:19:48.591
Well, I thought
she was with you.


330
00:19:48.691 --> 00:19:50.559
No, she was. But,

331
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.761
you know...

332
00:19:51.861 --> 00:19:54.731
I gotta give her
the post-date review.


333
00:20:15.685 --> 00:20:19.922
Yep. Caulk the shower, guest
bath, that piece of molding.


334
00:20:20.022 --> 00:20:23.059
Master bedroom,
loose vents, living room.


335
00:20:23.159 --> 00:20:25.962
Uh-huh, and when the punch list is
done then you'll get the balance.


336
00:20:26.062 --> 00:20:27.363
Please hurry, okay?

337
00:20:27.463 --> 00:20:30.299
I need to lease that place ASAP.

338
00:20:30.399 --> 00:20:33.169
What... Okay, just hang
on one second, please.


339
00:20:33.269 --> 00:20:35.071
Yes, honey.

340
00:20:35.171 --> 00:20:36.839
I know what I'm gonna do.

341
00:20:39.709 --> 00:20:40.777
About what?

342
00:20:42.278 --> 00:20:44.981
I'm gonna help homeless kids.

343
00:20:45.081 --> 00:20:46.382
You...

344
00:20:46.983 --> 00:20:49.385
Um...

345
00:20:49.485 --> 00:20:52.989
No, I said when you complete the punch
list then you'll get the payment.


346
00:20:53.089 --> 00:20:56.325
Well, I'm sorry, but otherwise what
incentive do you have to finish?


347
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.776
They're all so expensive.

348
00:21:13.876 --> 00:21:16.012
Well, if you insist
on including a toy,


349
00:21:16.112 --> 00:21:17.723
why don't you just leave out
some of the other things?


350
00:21:17.747 --> 00:21:19.081
No, Mom, I don't want to.

351
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:22.151
Hey, do you want some
cheese with that whine?


352
00:21:22.251 --> 00:21:24.320
Just skip the toy,
it's not a big deal.


353
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.756
No. The toy's important.

354
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.093
I've been thinking...

355
00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:34.764
If you have nothing,
no home, nothing,


356
00:21:36.132 --> 00:21:39.235
then a toy would mean a lot.

357
00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:42.972
Well, then it doesn't matter
if it's cheap or expensive.


358
00:21:43.072 --> 00:21:44.807
Just has to be a good toy.

359
00:21:44.907 --> 00:21:46.242
Okay?

360
00:21:47.209 --> 00:21:48.711
Okay.

361
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.453
Uh, excuse me. Do you
have any cheap toys?


362
00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.022
How cheap?

363
00:22:00.122 --> 00:22:02.224
Real cheap.

364
00:22:02.324 --> 00:22:04.436
What is this, like a birthday
present for somebody you don't like?


365
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.329
No. It's gotta be
a great toy.


366
00:22:07.429 --> 00:22:11.067
But I need a lot of them.
Couple hundred.


367
00:22:11.167 --> 00:22:13.870
I have money, but not a lot.

368
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.938
Okay.

369
00:22:16.038 --> 00:22:18.240
Let's go with the classics.

370
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.909
Follow me.

371
00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:25.147
How about a yo-yo?

372
00:22:25.247 --> 00:22:26.816
Yo-yo's are nice.
How much?


373
00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:28.818
Well, the Duncan Butterfly
is $4.99.


374
00:22:28.918 --> 00:22:32.354
But the Duncan Imperial,
a very good yo-yo, is $3.49.


375
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.092
I don't know.

376
00:22:36.192 --> 00:22:37.326
Um...

377
00:22:37.426 --> 00:22:39.195
Sir, we are, um...

378
00:22:39.295 --> 00:22:42.231
We're trying to put together
these, sort of, um,


379
00:22:42.331 --> 00:22:44.433
care packages for homeless kids,

380
00:22:44.533 --> 00:22:46.769
and they've got, um,
some food in them,


381
00:22:46.869 --> 00:22:48.838
hygiene kits, underwear.

382
00:22:48.938 --> 00:22:51.974
Maybe candy, something
to read and, uh...


383
00:22:52.074 --> 00:22:54.243
And a toy if we can afford it.

384
00:22:54.343 --> 00:22:56.445
A toy for sure.

385
00:22:56.545 --> 00:23:00.249
You see, Zach here has been
raising the money all by himself.


386
00:23:00.349 --> 00:23:02.384
He's been collecting donations.

387
00:23:02.484 --> 00:23:05.221
Selling bottles of water at
various events, things like that.


388
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:08.124
Well, no kidding.

389
00:23:08.224 --> 00:23:11.393
My brother goes homeless on
me every once in a while.


390
00:23:11.493 --> 00:23:13.930
He's, uh...
He's a bit schizo.


391
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.865
Well, actually he's full schizo.

392
00:23:15.965 --> 00:23:18.000
And every once in a while
he stops taking his meds


393
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.304
and he finds himself back out on the
streets and I go looking for him.


394
00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:25.842
I've seen some stuff.

395
00:23:25.942 --> 00:23:28.878
So, I'll tell you what I'm
gonna do for you, young man.


396
00:23:28.978 --> 00:23:31.313
I am gonna sell you
these yo-yo's at wholesale,


397
00:23:31.413 --> 00:23:36.018
and just for nothing I'm gonna
throw in a gross of Gertie Balls.


398
00:23:37.153 --> 00:23:38.320
Gertie Balls are cool.

399
00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.556
Yeah, you bet
Gertie Balls are cool.


400
00:23:40.656 --> 00:23:42.825
What's a wholesale?
Wholesale...


401
00:23:42.925 --> 00:23:44.193
What it cost me.

402
00:23:44.293 --> 00:23:47.463
It's about a buck
per unit, per yo-yo.


403
00:23:50.032 --> 00:23:51.167
I like wholesale.

404
00:23:51.267 --> 00:23:52.969
Deal.

405
00:23:53.069 --> 00:23:54.570
Deal.

406
00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.381
All right, now what are you
gonna put all those things in?


407
00:23:56.405 --> 00:23:59.108
I can give you a couple of bags.

408
00:23:59.208 --> 00:24:00.518
Did you remember
your wallet, Son?


409
00:24:00.542 --> 00:24:02.511
Yes, Mom.
Good boy.


410
00:24:10.452 --> 00:24:12.021
Backpacks?

411
00:24:15.124 --> 00:24:16.592
Backpacks.

412
00:24:16.692 --> 00:24:18.060
Every kid needs a backpack.

413
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.296
Something to put their stuff in.

414
00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:22.098
Backpacks, too?

415
00:24:22.198 --> 00:24:25.034
Okay, I'm gonna need
to see your 501.


416
00:24:25.134 --> 00:24:26.936
My what?

417
00:24:27.036 --> 00:24:29.105
Your 501?

418
00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:32.041
You're gonna need one of those if
you're gonna call yourself a charity.


419
00:24:32.141 --> 00:24:35.244
And I'm gonna need to see one if I'm
gonna get an okay from corporate.


420
00:24:35.344 --> 00:24:37.279
Oh. Okay,
I can do that.


421
00:24:38.714 --> 00:24:41.117
Well, okay.
You go do that.


422
00:24:41.217 --> 00:24:43.561
And I'll get your stuff together
here and you come back and get it.


423
00:24:43.585 --> 00:24:45.321
Okay, thanks.

424
00:24:45.421 --> 00:24:47.089
Right. Ask for me.

425
00:24:48.991 --> 00:24:50.292
Hey, Mom.

426
00:24:50.392 --> 00:24:52.128
Hey!

427
00:24:52.228 --> 00:24:53.462
What you doing?

428
00:24:55.297 --> 00:24:57.066
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

429
00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:00.436
Your father used
to handle all this.


430
00:25:00.536 --> 00:25:03.239
He used to handle
everything, really.


431
00:25:03.339 --> 00:25:04.473
How was school?

432
00:25:04.573 --> 00:25:06.108
Same old, same old.

433
00:25:06.208 --> 00:25:07.552
Mrs. Moon is taking us
on a field trip


434
00:25:07.576 --> 00:25:09.245
to the Museum of
Science and Industry.


435
00:25:09.345 --> 00:25:11.113
Hey! That's gonna be fun.

436
00:25:11.213 --> 00:25:13.983
Yeah, and you need to sign
this permission slip.


437
00:25:14.083 --> 00:25:18.921
Okay. And I need $25 for
tickets, lunch, and everything.


438
00:25:19.021 --> 00:25:22.024
You want something to drink?
I'm okay.


439
00:25:22.124 --> 00:25:23.259
$25?

440
00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:24.593
Yeah.

441
00:25:26.128 --> 00:25:27.930
Um...

442
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.631
You might have
to be sick that day.


443
00:25:31.067 --> 00:25:32.601
Really?

444
00:25:32.701 --> 00:25:34.403
Sorry.

445
00:25:35.304 --> 00:25:38.240
Don't get it. Jim.

446
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.110
Hey, Mr. Deason.
Hi, Jimmy. Mrs. Craig.


447
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:42.644
Hi, Mr. Deason.

448
00:25:48.484 --> 00:25:49.952
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:50.052 --> 00:25:52.288
Mr. Deason, I am trying.
I really am.


450
00:25:52.388 --> 00:25:56.325
But my unemployment just ran
out and my part-time job...


451
00:25:56.425 --> 00:25:59.928
I hardly make enough money
to put food on the table.


452
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:01.964
If you could just
give me a little more time.


453
00:26:02.064 --> 00:26:04.200
It isn't me, Mrs. Craig.

454
00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:06.635
It's, uh...

455
00:26:06.735 --> 00:26:09.705
I mean, all I do is fix
toilets and collect the rent.


456
00:26:09.805 --> 00:26:11.640
It's my bosses.

457
00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.510
I mean, they're on
my back constantly.


458
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:16.212
It's like, uh...

459
00:26:16.312 --> 00:26:19.048
Maybe if you could put some
money on the back rent.


460
00:26:19.148 --> 00:26:21.093
Do you think you could give
me to the end of the week


461
00:26:21.117 --> 00:26:23.019
to put some money together?

462
00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:26.188
I'm sorry, there's really
nothing I can do about that.


463
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.693
Mr. Deason, do you know
anybody who wants a TV?


464
00:26:31.793 --> 00:26:35.131
It's a big screen.
It's practically brand new.


465
00:26:35.231 --> 00:26:38.700
Well, I don't know anyone,
but I can ask around.


466
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.669
Okay.
Mmm-hmm.


467
00:26:49.545 --> 00:26:52.614
Uh, we're here about a 501.

468
00:26:53.682 --> 00:26:55.217
Did you get the instructions?

469
00:26:56.152 --> 00:26:58.087
Yes, ma'am, we did.

470
00:26:58.187 --> 00:27:01.723
And, um, they just served to confuse
us more, if you know what I mean.


471
00:27:01.823 --> 00:27:04.660
There's an 800 number helpline.
Did you call it?


472
00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.762
Yes, ma'am,
we did call that helpline


473
00:27:06.862 --> 00:27:08.764
and, uh, there was quite a wait

474
00:27:08.864 --> 00:27:12.634
and when we finally did get
a human being on the line,


475
00:27:12.734 --> 00:27:17.473
um, how shall I put it, that human being
seemed just as confused as we were.


476
00:27:17.573 --> 00:27:19.007
So...

477
00:27:19.108 --> 00:27:21.009
I don't know
what to tell you then.


478
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.545
You want to establish
a tax-free exempt status,


479
00:27:23.645 --> 00:27:25.647
you have to apply
like everyone else.


480
00:27:25.747 --> 00:27:27.749
Well, ma'am, what we were hoping

481
00:27:27.849 --> 00:27:30.786
is that somebody could just
walk us through the application.


482
00:27:30.886 --> 00:27:33.255
What? There's no one here
who does that.


483
00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:37.293
That's what the 800 number is for.
And the instructions.


484
00:27:37.393 --> 00:27:39.561
Right. The instructions.

485
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:45.601
Okay, well,
thank you for your help.


486
00:27:46.835 --> 00:27:48.070
Wait.

487
00:27:49.405 --> 00:27:50.572
Ma'am.

488
00:27:51.673 --> 00:27:54.276
You know any kids?
Of course.


489
00:27:54.376 --> 00:27:56.044
I have three grandchildren.

490
00:27:56.145 --> 00:27:58.414
Well, I'm trying to help kids.

491
00:27:58.514 --> 00:27:59.681
Kids without homes.

492
00:27:59.781 --> 00:28:02.184
You? You're trying
to help them?


493
00:28:02.518 --> 00:28:03.552
Yep.

494
00:28:03.652 --> 00:28:07.156
This 501 thing is for me.

495
00:28:07.256 --> 00:28:08.457
You see, um,

496
00:28:08.557 --> 00:28:10.692
Zach here has been
collecting donations


497
00:28:10.792 --> 00:28:13.262
for hurricane victim relief
for most of the year.


498
00:28:13.362 --> 00:28:15.540
And now he wants to do the
same thing for homeless kids.


499
00:28:15.564 --> 00:28:18.634
But I need this 501 thing...

500
00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:20.669
Yeah. To make it all legal.

501
00:28:20.769 --> 00:28:23.205
This 501 thing.

502
00:28:25.674 --> 00:28:27.385
What if one of your
grandchildren was homeless?


503
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:30.379
Oh, don't try and
soft soap me, mister.


504
00:28:33.315 --> 00:28:36.185
How would you like
to go to lunch with me?


505
00:28:37.686 --> 00:28:39.355
Hey, Mom.

506
00:28:42.191 --> 00:28:44.393
Where were you?
I was worried.


507
00:28:44.493 --> 00:28:48.130
Oh, um, I sold the rest
of my games and those DVDs.


508
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.265
I got over $40.

509
00:28:56.538 --> 00:28:58.207
Oh, sweets.

510
00:29:09.818 --> 00:29:12.421
Listen, I need you
to go and pack a bag.


511
00:29:12.521 --> 00:29:15.157
Are we going on a trip?

512
00:29:15.257 --> 00:29:16.625
We have to move. Tonight.

513
00:29:16.725 --> 00:29:18.494
And we have to be
very quiet about it.


514
00:29:18.594 --> 00:29:20.362
We can't let
Mr. Deason see us.


515
00:29:21.363 --> 00:29:23.765
Why? Where are we going?

516
00:29:23.865 --> 00:29:25.634
Are we going to a hotel?

517
00:29:25.734 --> 00:29:27.569
We don't have enough
money for a hotel,


518
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:29.905
we're gonna have
to stay in the car.


519
00:29:30.506 --> 00:29:32.508
In the car?

520
00:29:32.608 --> 00:29:35.128
It's just for a little while.
Till I can figure out some things.


521
00:29:35.877 --> 00:29:37.213
Well, what about school?

522
00:29:37.313 --> 00:29:39.348
You go to school
like you always do.


523
00:29:42.418 --> 00:29:43.885
Now go pack.

524
00:29:43.985 --> 00:29:45.654
Suitcase on the bed.

525
00:29:54.763 --> 00:29:55.931
What about all my stuff?

526
00:29:56.031 --> 00:29:58.867
My computer,
my Gamebite, my stuff.


527
00:29:58.967 --> 00:30:00.878
We're gonna have to leave
a lot of the stuff behind.


528
00:30:00.902 --> 00:30:02.604
I'm leaving a note
for Mr. Deason,


529
00:30:02.704 --> 00:30:04.482
telling him he can sell it
to make up for what we owe...


530
00:30:04.506 --> 00:30:05.741
Sell my stuff. No!

531
00:30:05.841 --> 00:30:07.743
I am leaving a lot
of my stuff behind, too.


532
00:30:07.843 --> 00:30:09.678
Most of my clothes.
Now go on.


533
00:30:09.778 --> 00:30:13.549
Mom, it's not fair. I already
moved and I lost all my...


534
00:30:13.649 --> 00:30:15.384
No, it's not fair.

535
00:30:15.484 --> 00:30:17.753
It's not fair.
I'm sorry.


536
00:30:21.423 --> 00:30:24.326
I'm begging you. Please
just go and pack a bag.


537
00:31:21.483 --> 00:31:22.951
Look at their faces.

538
00:31:38.534 --> 00:31:40.602
It's just like watching
Christmas morning.


539
00:31:42.404 --> 00:31:44.940
We cannot thank you enough
for everything, Miss Bonner.


540
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.643
Oh, well, it was
all Zach's doing.


541
00:31:47.743 --> 00:31:49.645
Well, Zach, we thank you.

542
00:31:49.745 --> 00:31:50.879
You did a good thing here.

543
00:31:50.979 --> 00:31:52.614
Thank you.

544
00:31:52.714 --> 00:31:55.951
I just wish
we had room for them all.


545
00:31:57.786 --> 00:32:00.522
Well, thank you again, so much.

546
00:32:00.622 --> 00:32:02.324
Oh, it was
a pleasure meeting you.


547
00:32:02.424 --> 00:32:05.293
It was nice meeting you, too.
Zach, thank you.


548
00:32:07.563 --> 00:32:10.432
All Zach's doing? Really?

549
00:32:10.532 --> 00:32:12.668
Mom, what am I?
Hired help?


550
00:32:12.768 --> 00:32:15.404
Well, I just meant it
was his idea, that's all.


551
00:32:15.504 --> 00:32:17.305
Don't get all huffy.

552
00:32:17.406 --> 00:32:19.808
You got that boy,
and Zach has this.


553
00:32:19.908 --> 00:32:22.077
Whoa! Not the same thing.

554
00:32:22.177 --> 00:32:25.947
Not even close
to the same thing.


555
00:32:26.047 --> 00:32:27.816
That boy... You can't
even say his name.


556
00:32:27.916 --> 00:32:29.418
His name is Ian.

557
00:32:29.518 --> 00:32:31.953
I know his name.
I hear it enough.


558
00:32:32.053 --> 00:32:33.822
You don't know
anything about him.


559
00:32:33.922 --> 00:32:35.600
And have you ever even
invited him over for dinner


560
00:32:35.624 --> 00:32:37.426
and tried to get
to know him? No!


561
00:32:37.526 --> 00:32:39.628
Well, I don't need to know
him to know that you're...


562
00:32:39.728 --> 00:32:42.030
That you're too young
to be going steady.


563
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.965
"Going steady"?
Mmm-hmm.


564
00:32:44.065 --> 00:32:46.435
What is this?
The '50s?


565
00:32:46.535 --> 00:32:49.705
Mom, be honest. You wouldn't
like any boy I went out with.


566
00:32:49.805 --> 00:32:50.872
That is...

567
00:32:55.411 --> 00:32:57.413
This boy that...

568
00:32:57.879 --> 00:32:59.448
This Ian...

569
00:33:00.115 --> 00:33:01.617
You really like him?

570
00:33:02.818 --> 00:33:04.853
He makes me feel special.

571
00:33:06.755 --> 00:33:08.123
You're special to me.

572
00:33:08.223 --> 00:33:11.860
No, Zach's special to you.

573
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.663
You always wanted me to
be special, but I'm not.


574
00:33:14.763 --> 00:33:16.498
I...

575
00:33:16.598 --> 00:33:18.800
I cannot...

576
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.502
Zach, let's go.

577
00:33:21.036 --> 00:33:23.572
Here, you drive.

578
00:33:23.672 --> 00:33:26.007
Zach, in the back.
Come on. Let's go.


579
00:33:26.107 --> 00:33:27.142
Face it, Mom.

580
00:33:27.242 --> 00:33:28.910
Dance classes, tennis classes,

581
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.012
photography,
cheerleading, the hospice,


582
00:33:31.112 --> 00:33:32.948
all those things
that you made me do.


583
00:33:33.048 --> 00:33:34.916
Made? You...

584
00:33:35.016 --> 00:33:37.486
You wanted to do those things!

585
00:33:37.586 --> 00:33:39.120
I was encouraging
your interests.


586
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.089
No, you wanted me
to do those things.


587
00:33:41.189 --> 00:33:44.025
And even when I did, you pushed
me until I didn't any more.


588
00:33:46.061 --> 00:33:47.896
The tennis matches and camp?

589
00:33:47.996 --> 00:33:49.996
I just wanted to play once
in a while, not compete.


590
00:34:09.985 --> 00:34:11.820
Roll the window down.

591
00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.922
The window.
Roll it down.


592
00:34:17.058 --> 00:34:18.894
Ma'am, I'm afraid
you can't sleep here.


593
00:34:18.994 --> 00:34:21.663
This is commercial property and
I could cite you for trespassing.


594
00:34:21.763 --> 00:34:23.164
Really? I'm sorry.

595
00:34:23.264 --> 00:34:25.133
If you don't have
any money for a hotel room,


596
00:34:25.233 --> 00:34:26.668
there's a homeless
shelter downtown,


597
00:34:26.768 --> 00:34:29.004
the Metropolitan Ministry
on Florida Avenue.


598
00:34:29.104 --> 00:34:31.507
If they're full, I got a

599
00:34:31.607 --> 00:34:33.208
No, no, we're not
homeless, Officer.


600
00:34:33.308 --> 00:34:35.977
Okay. Well,
you still have to move on.


601
00:34:36.077 --> 00:34:38.146
There's a rest stop about
eight miles up the 75.


602
00:34:38.246 --> 00:34:39.581
You think you can find it?

603
00:34:39.681 --> 00:34:41.182
Uh, up the 75? Okay.

604
00:34:41.282 --> 00:34:43.919
Be careful.
Lock your doors.


605
00:34:44.019 --> 00:34:46.454
You take care of
your mom now, okay?


606
00:34:46.555 --> 00:34:48.624
Thank you, Officer.
Seatbelt.


607
00:34:51.259 --> 00:34:54.496
So you would be willing to take
some domestic work? Housekeeping...


608
00:34:54.596 --> 00:34:56.036
At this point,
I would take anything.


609
00:34:56.131 --> 00:34:59.234
I just need to work.
A paycheck of some sort.


610
00:35:00.802 --> 00:35:04.806
Um, you haven't listed
an address here?


611
00:35:04.906 --> 00:35:06.508
What about a phone number?

612
00:35:07.242 --> 00:35:08.944
I don't have one right now.

613
00:35:09.044 --> 00:35:10.712
Um, is that a problem?

614
00:35:12.914 --> 00:35:16.084
Well, how are we supposed to
contact you if something opens up?


615
00:35:16.184 --> 00:35:18.186
Well, how about I call you?

616
00:35:18.286 --> 00:35:22.023
Say, once a day to check whether
you have anything for me?


617
00:35:23.959 --> 00:35:25.727
Yeah, we can try that.

618
00:35:25.827 --> 00:35:28.263
But don't harass me
with a lot of phone calls?


619
00:35:28.363 --> 00:35:31.066
Absolutely.
No, of course not.


620
00:35:31.733 --> 00:35:32.901
Okay.

621
00:35:33.001 --> 00:35:35.971
Thanks for your application,
and we'll give you a call...


622
00:35:36.071 --> 00:35:37.806
I'll be waiting for your call.

623
00:35:40.275 --> 00:35:44.045
Did you give any more thought about what
we talked about, about the college thing?


624
00:35:45.313 --> 00:35:47.983
I don't think I'm really
the college type.


625
00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:49.851
You've seen my grades.

626
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:51.853
Well...
I dunno.


627
00:35:51.953 --> 00:35:53.889
How about your photography?

628
00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:56.257
Stop with the photography thing.

629
00:35:56.357 --> 00:35:59.027
That's just, you know, for fun.

630
00:35:59.127 --> 00:36:01.697
Okay.
I like cooking.


631
00:36:03.031 --> 00:36:04.299
I don't know.

632
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.968
I love to eat.

633
00:36:07.068 --> 00:36:09.137
So, you know...

634
00:36:09.237 --> 00:36:11.239
Cooking thing, maybe?

635
00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:13.150
Well, maybe you should take
some classes over the summer.


636
00:36:13.174 --> 00:36:14.542
See if you like it.

637
00:36:14.643 --> 00:36:16.712
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.


638
00:36:16.812 --> 00:36:18.046
Are they expensive?

639
00:36:18.146 --> 00:36:21.750
I don't know. It's gotta
be cheaper than college.


640
00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.085
You know, we could
take 'em together.


641
00:36:25.787 --> 00:36:27.322
Really?
Yeah.


642
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:32.227
Seriously?
That would be so cool.


643
00:36:33.862 --> 00:36:34.896
All right.

644
00:36:37.165 --> 00:36:39.334
Huh. Wonder who that is.

645
00:36:44.005 --> 00:36:46.007
Hi, Z. Bonner?

646
00:36:46.107 --> 00:36:49.577
His mother, but I'm willing to
give that up for some quiet.


647
00:36:49.678 --> 00:36:51.212
I got a package here
for Zach Bonner.


648
00:36:51.312 --> 00:36:53.114
Can you sign this, please?

649
00:36:54.315 --> 00:36:56.017
Okay.

650
00:36:56.117 --> 00:36:57.585
Uh...

651
00:36:58.353 --> 00:36:59.921
Thank you very much.

652
00:37:00.021 --> 00:37:01.757
All right.
Um, excuse me?


653
00:37:02.423 --> 00:37:03.825
Where's our package?

654
00:37:03.925 --> 00:37:06.862
It's not one.
It's 500 of them.


655
00:37:06.962 --> 00:37:09.197
500 what?
Bears.


656
00:37:09.297 --> 00:37:11.332
500 Build
-A
-Bear bears.

657
00:37:13.268 --> 00:37:15.103
Yes! Whoo! Yes!

658
00:37:15.203 --> 00:37:19.107
Oh, my...
Zach, what did you do?


659
00:37:19.207 --> 00:37:22.310
Well, I sent 100 e-mails
to big companies


660
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:25.180
asking for donations,

661
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.848
and one answered.

662
00:37:26.948 --> 00:37:28.884
So, where do you want 'em?

663
00:37:28.984 --> 00:37:30.819
Uh...

664
00:37:30.919 --> 00:37:34.355
In the garage,
I guess. Zach?


665
00:37:34.455 --> 00:37:37.859
What are we supposed to do
with 500 stuffed bears?


666
00:37:41.763 --> 00:37:43.999
On behalf of myself,
Kristy Kilgo,


667
00:37:44.099 --> 00:37:47.235
and all the employees here
at the Lazydays RV center,


668
00:37:47.335 --> 00:37:49.080
we would like to welcome
the mothers and children


669
00:37:49.104 --> 00:37:51.106
of the Tampa Bay
Shelter for Women


670
00:37:51.206 --> 00:37:53.875
and wish them
a very merry Christmas.


671
00:37:53.975 --> 00:37:55.276
I got a bear.

672
00:37:57.145 --> 00:37:58.213
Oh!

673
00:37:58.313 --> 00:37:59.748
Oh, that hurt!

674
00:37:59.848 --> 00:38:01.149
They're really good.

675
00:38:01.249 --> 00:38:02.259
- Merry Christmas.
- Enjoy.


676
00:38:02.283 --> 00:38:03.885
Oh, I will. Thank you.

677
00:38:03.985 --> 00:38:06.788
Enjoy. Merry Christmas.

678
00:38:06.888 --> 00:38:09.424
You've been a good girl, right?
You promise?


679
00:38:09.524 --> 00:38:10.692
Yes.
Okay.


680
00:38:10.792 --> 00:38:12.027
You have a merry Christmas.

681
00:38:12.127 --> 00:38:14.295
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas.


682
00:38:15.163 --> 00:38:16.798
Hi! Merry Christmas!

683
00:38:17.298 --> 00:38:20.035
This is for you.

684
00:38:20.135 --> 00:38:21.669
Hi...
You promise?


685
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:23.004
All right.
I promise.


686
00:38:24.272 --> 00:38:26.341
Merry Christmas.

687
00:38:26.441 --> 00:38:28.076
How are you?
Good.


688
00:38:28.176 --> 00:38:30.045
Good.
Enjoy.


689
00:38:30.145 --> 00:38:32.748
Merry Christmas.

690
00:38:32.848 --> 00:38:36.151
Um, I'm sorry, Nana. I was told
that CNN would pick it up...


691
00:38:36.251 --> 00:38:38.286
I was promised CNN.

692
00:38:38.386 --> 00:38:39.821
Hello!

693
00:38:39.921 --> 00:38:41.790
Stand over here.

694
00:38:43.792 --> 00:38:45.193
Okay, let's get
some kids over here


695
00:38:45.293 --> 00:38:46.795
and kick this puppy
down the stairs.


696
00:38:46.895 --> 00:38:48.930
Thank you. Let's get
you some presents.


697
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.099
Thank you. You were great.
Merry Christmas.


698
00:38:52.968 --> 00:38:56.004
TV legend Nana Galloway
stopped in Tampa recently.


699
00:38:56.104 --> 00:38:58.807
Santa, I need to borrow
you just a second.


700
00:38:58.907 --> 00:39:01.009
To promote
her charitable foundation


701
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:03.378
and her recently
released box set


702
00:39:03.478 --> 00:39:06.014
of her TV series, Busybody.

703
00:39:06.114 --> 00:39:08.884
She's here to help less
fortunate women and children.


704
00:39:08.984 --> 00:39:11.286
Let's have a word with her.
Miss Galloway...


705
00:39:11.386 --> 00:39:14.289
Excuse me, chief. Nana...

706
00:39:14.389 --> 00:39:18.226
What drives you to interrupt your
busy schedule to do things like this?


707
00:39:18.326 --> 00:39:20.228
I'm always looking to help.
It's what I do.


708
00:39:20.328 --> 00:39:21.396
It's part of who I am.

709
00:39:21.496 --> 00:39:23.298
Busybody?

710
00:39:23.999 --> 00:39:25.500
Yep.

711
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.368
It was a little
before your time.


712
00:39:27.468 --> 00:39:30.772
It was about this old lady who
snoops around her neighborhood,


713
00:39:30.872 --> 00:39:32.740
solving everyone's problems.

714
00:39:32.841 --> 00:39:34.442
I'm always looking to help.

715
00:39:34.542 --> 00:39:36.744
Big smile. It's in my
nature, what I'm all about.


716
00:39:36.845 --> 00:39:39.480
I'm just hoping that tonight
we can give a little joy


717
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.182
to these women and children...

718
00:39:41.282 --> 00:39:43.351
It was opposite Fantasy Island.

719
00:39:43.451 --> 00:39:46.221
The looks on their little faces
when they open these presents


720
00:39:46.321 --> 00:39:48.824
is the only gift I need
this Christmas.


721
00:39:48.924 --> 00:39:50.391
Laurie. Hi!
Oh!


722
00:39:50.491 --> 00:39:52.136
I haven't seen you
since the Be More Awards.


723
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.862
Kristy, I'm so sorry.

724
00:39:53.962 --> 00:39:56.131
I didn't see you standing there.

725
00:39:56.231 --> 00:39:58.309
And I'm sorry we didn't come
over earlier to say hello.


726
00:39:58.333 --> 00:40:01.536
You did such a good job
putting this all on for Zach.


727
00:40:01.636 --> 00:40:04.439
Oh, well, me and Harold
and our foundation.


728
00:40:04.539 --> 00:40:06.441
But, really, it's
our employees here.


729
00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:08.076
They volunteer their time,

730
00:40:08.176 --> 00:40:10.345
but they also have
a portion of their income


731
00:40:10.445 --> 00:40:12.423
deducted from every paycheck to
help fund our charitable works.


732
00:40:12.447 --> 00:40:14.182
Wow.

733
00:40:14.282 --> 00:40:17.252
At Lazydays, we like to say,
"We pay the kids first."


734
00:40:17.352 --> 00:40:19.821
one collection.
I'm glad I could help.


735
00:40:19.921 --> 00:40:21.789
We really appreciate it.

736
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.959
Doesn't it just grind
your middle kidney


737
00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:27.428
that Galloway's riding
on your son's coattails?


738
00:40:27.528 --> 00:40:29.430
Well...
You know what?


739
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.299
You should get in
on this photo opportunity.


740
00:40:31.399 --> 00:40:33.201
You're responsible
for most of this.


741
00:40:33.301 --> 00:40:35.036
Miss Galloway?

742
00:40:35.136 --> 00:40:37.072
Yes? Um...

743
00:40:37.172 --> 00:40:39.040
Miss Galloway,
this is Zach Bonner.


744
00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.276
His foundation helped
make this event happen.


745
00:40:41.376 --> 00:40:43.044
A lot of it.

746
00:40:43.144 --> 00:40:44.588
I think you should get a
picture with the Bonner family.


747
00:40:44.612 --> 00:40:46.181
No, that's okay.
You go.


748
00:40:46.281 --> 00:40:48.884
All right, let's bring
you right over here.


749
00:40:51.386 --> 00:40:54.856
And maybe just with
the kid for now.


750
00:40:54.956 --> 00:41:00.295
A little young to have your
own foundation, mister.


751
00:41:00.395 --> 00:41:02.163
Maybe you could help us.

752
00:41:02.263 --> 00:41:03.531
Some autographed photos,

753
00:41:03.631 --> 00:41:05.333
or some DVDs.

754
00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:08.469
We like to sell that kind of
stuff on eBay to raise money.


755
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:10.649
Sorry, son, but Nana doesn't
get involved in anything


756
00:41:10.705 --> 00:41:13.208
that raises less than
a million dollars.


757
00:41:13.308 --> 00:41:15.210
I can raise a million dollars.

758
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:17.478
A bit of advice, Jack?

759
00:41:17.578 --> 00:41:19.314
Zach.
Whatever.


760
00:41:19.414 --> 00:41:22.517
Do kid things. Stay a
kid as long as you can.


761
00:41:22.617 --> 00:41:24.953
You leave this kind
of thing to us adults.


762
00:41:25.053 --> 00:41:27.956
We'll be late for the next appointment.
Bye, everyone.


763
00:41:28.056 --> 00:41:29.624
Ugh! Did you see me
get ganked?


764
00:41:29.724 --> 00:41:31.392
Ganked? What kind of
word is that?


765
00:41:31.492 --> 00:41:33.204
And then that d-bag pushed me
out of the picture. Hey! Hush!


766
00:41:33.228 --> 00:41:35.230
Don't you be calling people
d-bags in the middle...


767
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.141
Like I was gonna break their
freakin' camera! You be quiet now!


768
00:41:37.165 --> 00:41:39.467
Okay, you were mistreated.
What do you want me to do?


769
00:41:39.567 --> 00:41:41.436
Just say the word.

770
00:41:41.536 --> 00:41:43.347
Don't say that word. Say any other word.
Hey, hey, hey!


771
00:41:43.371 --> 00:41:45.373
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Consider me vented. Lord!


772
00:41:45.473 --> 00:41:47.375
Oh.

773
00:41:47.475 --> 00:41:49.310
Mom?
Yes, honey.


774
00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:52.380
You think Nana Galloway really
raised a million dollars?


775
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.983
Well, I don't doubt it.
I mean, she's famous.


776
00:41:55.083 --> 00:41:58.319
You get that much attention from the
media, you can do just about anything.


777
00:41:58.419 --> 00:42:00.388
Oh, the power of publicity.

778
00:42:00.488 --> 00:42:02.257
Mmm.
Publicity?


779
00:42:02.357 --> 00:42:05.060
Yeah, you know.
The TV and the news people,


780
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.628
and, like, when papers and
magazines write about you.


781
00:42:07.728 --> 00:42:11.532
Or, you know, when you were on TV
and you got all those donations.


782
00:42:11.632 --> 00:42:14.269
It was... It was just
ginormous. It was huge!


783
00:42:14.369 --> 00:42:16.637
Yeah, I know what publicity is,

784
00:42:17.605 --> 00:42:19.407
but how do you get it?

785
00:42:19.507 --> 00:42:21.977
Well, you just gotta do something
that'll get their attention.


786
00:42:22.077 --> 00:42:23.911
You know, like Paris Hilton.

787
00:42:24.012 --> 00:42:25.622
Um, excuse me. Yeah, that's good.
Like she has...


788
00:42:25.646 --> 00:42:27.548
Paris Hilton? Don't be
giving him any ideas.


789
00:42:27.648 --> 00:42:29.384
I wasn't gonna... Okay.
Fine. That's a...


790
00:42:29.484 --> 00:42:31.095
I was just gonna tell him...
Fine. Thank you.


791
00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:32.420
The tape...
Stop it right there.


792
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.522
Okay.

793
00:42:36.557 --> 00:42:38.326
All right.

794
00:42:38.426 --> 00:42:40.295
There's no smoking,

795
00:42:40.395 --> 00:42:42.163
no alcohol,

796
00:42:42.263 --> 00:42:43.498
no drugs,

797
00:42:43.598 --> 00:42:45.033
no fighting,

798
00:42:45.133 --> 00:42:47.035
and no loud noises.
Thank you, Mom.


799
00:42:47.135 --> 00:42:51.006
And don't give
my staff any grief.


800
00:42:51.106 --> 00:42:53.674
There'll be a hot breakfast
from 7:30 to 9:00.


801
00:42:53.774 --> 00:42:56.377
You have to be out by 9:30.

802
00:42:56.477 --> 00:42:57.945
This is your room.

803
00:42:59.314 --> 00:43:00.681
Please be considerate,

804
00:43:02.217 --> 00:43:04.685
and clean up after yourselves.

805
00:43:04.785 --> 00:43:07.455
Have a good night.
Thank you. Good night.


806
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.059
I get the top bunk.

807
00:43:11.792 --> 00:43:13.528
It's not bad.

808
00:43:13.628 --> 00:43:15.496
It's clean.
Yeah.


809
00:43:23.604 --> 00:43:25.973
Wakey, eggs and bakey!

810
00:43:26.074 --> 00:43:28.209
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey!

811
00:43:31.312 --> 00:43:33.081
You okay?
Yeah.


812
00:43:35.483 --> 00:43:37.118
Did you sleep okay?

813
00:43:37.218 --> 00:43:38.319
Yeah. You?

814
00:43:38.419 --> 00:43:40.055
I slept pretty good.

815
00:43:41.389 --> 00:43:43.191
I smell bacon.

816
00:43:47.595 --> 00:43:49.664
Morning.
Morning.


817
00:43:49.764 --> 00:43:50.765
Mmm.

818
00:43:52.667 --> 00:43:54.435
Mmm. Should we get
some breakfast?


819
00:43:54.535 --> 00:43:56.003
Yeah.

820
00:44:00.075 --> 00:44:01.242
Mom,

821
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:03.778
where's my backpack?

822
00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.760
Did you bring it in
from the car?


823
00:44:06.814 --> 00:44:08.249
Yeah, it was right here.

824
00:44:12.253 --> 00:44:13.521
My bag's gone.

825
00:44:17.825 --> 00:44:20.728
How could... They came in
while we were sleeping?


826
00:44:22.197 --> 00:44:23.531
My purse...

827
00:44:28.836 --> 00:44:31.672
My wallet's gone. Somebody...

828
00:44:31.772 --> 00:44:34.542
How? It was... I mean, it was
right under my pillow! How could...


829
00:44:36.777 --> 00:44:40.148
My food stamp card,
my driver's license.


830
00:44:41.216 --> 00:44:42.817
Oh, God, no.

831
00:44:42.917 --> 00:44:44.452
My Gamebite.

832
00:44:44.552 --> 00:44:46.053
Your Gamebite?

833
00:44:46.554 --> 00:44:48.423
Your Gamebite.

834
00:44:48.523 --> 00:44:50.691
Do you realize what we just lost?
Do you?


835
00:44:53.394 --> 00:44:55.230
So what do we do now?

836
00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:58.065
I don't know.
If I knew, I would tell you!


837
00:45:09.377 --> 00:45:10.678
I'm sorry.

838
00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.715
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.


839
00:45:18.419 --> 00:45:20.488
From 1953 to 1981,

840
00:45:20.588 --> 00:45:23.358
a silver haired woman calling
herself only Peace Pilgrim,


841
00:45:23.458 --> 00:45:27.795
walked more than 25,000 miles on
a personal pilgrimage for peace.


842
00:45:27.895 --> 00:45:29.630
She vowed to remain a wanderer

843
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.732
until mankind has
learned the way of peace.


844
00:45:31.832 --> 00:45:33.468
Walking until given shelter,

845
00:45:33.568 --> 00:45:36.837
and fasting until given food.

846
00:45:38.839 --> 00:45:40.708
Ian and I broke up.

847
00:45:44.812 --> 00:45:45.813
Are you okay?

848
00:45:49.384 --> 00:45:51.752
Hey, guys, look at this.
We could do this.


849
00:45:51.852 --> 00:45:53.888
Do what?

850
00:45:53.988 --> 00:45:56.491
Walk across America to raise awareness.
About homeless kids.


851
00:45:56.591 --> 00:45:59.760
Across America?

852
00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.429
Zach, I don't think so.

853
00:46:01.529 --> 00:46:04.699
Well,
to Washington D.C. then.


854
00:46:04.799 --> 00:46:06.267
It'd be great publicity.

855
00:46:06.367 --> 00:46:08.603
It would get people to care
more about homeless kids.


856
00:46:08.703 --> 00:46:11.138
Good idea, Zach, but...

857
00:46:11.239 --> 00:46:13.274
Do you know how far that is?

858
00:46:13.374 --> 00:46:14.909
I mean, that'd take months.

859
00:46:15.009 --> 00:46:17.412
Well, to somewhere closer.

860
00:46:18.613 --> 00:46:20.881
Maybe to the state capital,
Atlanta.


861
00:46:20.981 --> 00:46:23.784
The state capital
is Tallahassee.


862
00:46:23.884 --> 00:46:26.921
No, I meant capital to capital.

863
00:46:27.021 --> 00:46:30.791
Tallahassee to Atlanta. Anyone
can walk to Tallahassee.


864
00:46:30.891 --> 00:46:32.760
Oh, you think so?

865
00:46:34.262 --> 00:46:35.296
Hmm.

866
00:46:36.564 --> 00:46:37.832
Maybe when you're older.

867
00:46:37.932 --> 00:46:39.800
How old?
Older.


868
00:46:41.236 --> 00:46:42.236
Twelve.

869
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:48.243
Oh, um...

870
00:46:48.943 --> 00:46:51.712
Can I get a job?

871
00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.415
Just, you know...

872
00:46:54.515 --> 00:46:57.952
But, Mom, I need
to do something big.


873
00:46:58.052 --> 00:47:00.888
Kelley, you said
that's what gets publicity,


874
00:47:00.988 --> 00:47:03.224
and publicity is
what gets donations.


875
00:47:03.324 --> 00:47:08.229
Look, don't get me involved in any
more of your cranial rectal ideas.


876
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:09.764
Whoa!

877
00:47:09.864 --> 00:47:13.601
Mom, you wanna
do something together.


878
00:47:13.701 --> 00:47:14.901
We could all do this together.

879
00:47:14.935 --> 00:47:16.971
Honey, what did I say?

880
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:18.439
Maybe when you're older.

881
00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.613
I don't know, Mama. He
does it 'cause he likes it.


882
00:47:25.713 --> 00:47:27.915
Uh...

883
00:47:28.015 --> 00:47:30.318
Yeah, and things.
Hundreds of Build-A-Bears,


884
00:47:30.418 --> 00:47:32.820
these things
called Gertie Balls.


885
00:47:34.755 --> 00:47:36.223
Why what?

886
00:47:36.324 --> 00:47:38.204
Why does he do it or
why do they give him money?


887
00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:40.628
Oh, hang on, Mama.

888
00:47:40.728 --> 00:47:42.330
Ms. Bonner.
Yes?


889
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:45.300
Ashley Legare, remember?
Channel 5 News.


890
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.602
I received an e-mail from Zach

891
00:47:47.702 --> 00:47:50.237
and we'd like to interview him
about his walk to Tallahassee.


892
00:47:50.738 --> 00:47:52.239
My Zach?

893
00:47:53.007 --> 00:47:54.275
Yes.

894
00:47:56.744 --> 00:47:58.913
Mama, I'm gonna
have to call you back.


895
00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.349
All right.

896
00:48:03.484 --> 00:48:05.653
Zach Bonner!

897
00:48:05.753 --> 00:48:09.724
Did you check the map? Do you
know how far it is to Tallahassee?


898
00:48:09.824 --> 00:48:11.526
Not really, no.

899
00:48:13.093 --> 00:48:14.829
Well, who is going with you?

900
00:48:15.963 --> 00:48:17.398
My mom and my sister.

901
00:48:18.098 --> 00:48:19.400
Okay.

902
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.536
So why is it you
really wanna do this?


903
00:48:21.636 --> 00:48:24.672
Well, because, you know,
it's helping homeless kids,


904
00:48:24.772 --> 00:48:26.040
and it's fun.

905
00:48:27.708 --> 00:48:29.977
For Channel 5,
this is Ashley Legare.


906
00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:32.313
And cut.

907
00:48:33.013 --> 00:48:34.415
That was great.

908
00:48:35.883 --> 00:48:38.453
All right. Nice work, little man.
Thanks.


909
00:48:38.553 --> 00:48:39.787
I'll get your mic, here.

910
00:48:39.887 --> 00:48:41.889
You must be so proud.

911
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:45.025
Yeah, I'm about to bust.

912
00:48:45.125 --> 00:48:46.661
You know, I was wondering...
Excuse me.


913
00:48:46.761 --> 00:48:48.729
All right, stay on
the state roads for sure.


914
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:50.541
That way you don't have to deal
with all the red tape and stuff


915
00:48:50.565 --> 00:48:52.066
you need on federal highways...

916
00:48:52.166 --> 00:48:54.077
And try to go through the
media market towns, you know?


917
00:48:54.101 --> 00:48:56.904
Oh, man! I know some of the
TV stations along the way.


918
00:48:57.004 --> 00:48:59.006
We can give 'em
a heads up, you know?


919
00:49:00.074 --> 00:49:01.075
Oh...

920
00:49:01.175 --> 00:49:02.910
You know what we can do?

921
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:04.945
Hook you up with a GPS tracker.

922
00:49:05.045 --> 00:49:07.482
You know, so people can
follow you on the Internet.


923
00:49:07.582 --> 00:49:09.817
Really?
That'd be so cool!


924
00:49:09.917 --> 00:49:11.786
The "Zach Tracker".

925
00:49:11.886 --> 00:49:13.621
Hey, Mom, did you hear that?

926
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:15.556
Oh, yeah, I heard it.

927
00:49:16.824 --> 00:49:18.826
I cannot believe

928
00:49:18.926 --> 00:49:22.363
that you went behind my
back after I told you no.


929
00:49:22.463 --> 00:49:24.399
There's no way we can do this.

930
00:49:24.499 --> 00:49:26.000
But I already announced it.

931
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.703
Well, that is your problem,
young man.


932
00:49:28.803 --> 00:49:31.748
You are just gonna have to call them up
and tell them that you changed your mind.


933
00:49:31.772 --> 00:49:34.542
What? But I wanna do it!

934
00:49:34.642 --> 00:49:36.511
Do you know how far it is?

935
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:38.546
Have you even thought
about this?


936
00:49:38.646 --> 00:49:40.915
I mean, who would
take care of the house?


937
00:49:41.015 --> 00:49:42.349
And have you
thought about money?


938
00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:44.719
We don't have the money
for all this.


939
00:49:44.819 --> 00:49:46.387
And then what about my business?

940
00:49:46.487 --> 00:49:48.889
I mean, I can't just be
traipsing halfway across Florida.


941
00:49:48.989 --> 00:49:51.426
Mom, it's just walking.

942
00:49:51.526 --> 00:49:53.894
It doesn't cost a thing
just to walk.


943
00:49:53.994 --> 00:49:55.663
Are you serious?

944
00:49:55.763 --> 00:49:57.465
What about hotel rooms?

945
00:49:57.565 --> 00:49:58.699
What about food?

946
00:49:58.799 --> 00:50:01.001
Well, I can
raise money for food.


947
00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:03.137
Get donations
from restaurants, I bet.


948
00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:09.376
And I called Kristy
from Lazydays


949
00:50:09.477 --> 00:50:11.479
to see if we can borrow an RV

950
00:50:11.579 --> 00:50:13.948
so we wouldn't have
to go to hotels.


951
00:50:14.048 --> 00:50:16.884
Their charity might give
us some money for gas.


952
00:50:17.952 --> 00:50:19.587
Are you telling me

953
00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.489
that you called

954
00:50:22.156 --> 00:50:24.525
after I told you no?

955
00:50:24.625 --> 00:50:25.626
No!

956
00:50:27.027 --> 00:50:29.597
I was just doing research.

957
00:50:29.697 --> 00:50:32.800
I asked her "if". They said
that they "might" help.


958
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.035
"Might", Zach.

959
00:50:35.135 --> 00:50:37.171
That is a long way from "yes".

960
00:50:38.573 --> 00:50:39.640
Okay.

961
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:42.142
But, Mom,

962
00:50:42.242 --> 00:50:45.980
if I get the RV
and raise enough money


963
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.616
and figure out the house thing,

964
00:50:49.817 --> 00:50:51.452
can I do it?

965
00:50:53.721 --> 00:50:57.692
Do you know how long it
would take to walk that far?


966
00:50:57.792 --> 00:50:59.426
Most of the summer, probably.

967
00:50:59.527 --> 00:51:02.597
And your sister and I
have plans.


968
00:51:02.697 --> 00:51:04.665
Kelley, you can help, too.

969
00:51:04.765 --> 00:51:07.568
It'd be fun. You could
do the publicity stuff.


970
00:51:07.668 --> 00:51:09.136
You're really good at that.

971
00:51:09.236 --> 00:51:11.806
Look, you can go on ahead,

972
00:51:11.906 --> 00:51:14.809
but you're doing
this one without me.


973
00:51:14.909 --> 00:51:17.678
No, Kel, it's for
all of us to do.


974
00:51:17.778 --> 00:51:19.680
It would be fun.
It could be like


975
00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.215
our family project
for the summer.


976
00:51:22.717 --> 00:51:24.819
Whenever we do
something together,


977
00:51:24.919 --> 00:51:26.687
we have so much fun.

978
00:51:26.787 --> 00:51:29.857
Remember making the Christmas
ornaments for the old folks' home?


979
00:51:29.957 --> 00:51:33.628
Christmas caroling? That was fun.
And it'll be like that.


980
00:51:33.728 --> 00:51:34.728
But better.

981
00:51:37.598 --> 00:51:40.067
Oh, come on, Kel.
Say yes.


982
00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:41.636
Say yes.

983
00:51:43.938 --> 00:51:47.207
I'll do anything you
want me to do after this.


984
00:51:53.548 --> 00:51:55.850
Okay. Maybe.

985
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:57.585
Maybe. That's it.

986
00:51:57.685 --> 00:51:58.853
Thanks, Kel.

987
00:51:58.953 --> 00:52:00.688
Mom?
Mmm...


988
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:03.758
Just hold on, mister.

989
00:52:03.858 --> 00:52:06.570
You still have some big hoops to jump
through before this is a done deal.


990
00:52:06.594 --> 00:52:09.229
No sweat. I'm gonna
go e-mail Kristy.


991
00:52:17.137 --> 00:52:19.907
So much for those
cooking classes, huh?


992
00:52:20.007 --> 00:52:22.509
Don't worry about it.

993
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.012
This is such a long shot, Kel.

994
00:52:26.781 --> 00:52:29.083
Any further business?

995
00:52:29.183 --> 00:52:31.518
Okay, before we go,

996
00:52:31.619 --> 00:52:33.263
Kristy and Harold have someone
who would like to speak to us.


997
00:52:33.287 --> 00:52:34.922
Zach Bonner.
You can do it.


998
00:52:35.022 --> 00:52:36.090
Zach?

999
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.301
Uh...

1000
00:52:48.603 --> 00:52:50.483
"Thank you for this
opportunity to speak to you.


1001
00:52:51.906 --> 00:52:55.643
"There are estimated 1.3 million
homeless children in the United States.


1002
00:52:55.743 --> 00:52:58.545
"2% of the children
in this country,


1003
00:52:58.646 --> 00:53:00.915
"10% of all poor children.

1004
00:53:01.015 --> 00:53:03.651
"The major causes
of child homelessness


1005
00:53:03.751 --> 00:53:07.187
"are family problems, economic
or money-related problems.


1006
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:14.762
"Homelessness makes these children
vulnerable to violence or abuse."


1007
00:53:26.373 --> 00:53:28.108
Okay, you know what?

1008
00:53:30.077 --> 00:53:31.679
You all got a Be More Award

1009
00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:34.157
for helping homeless children
get off the streets.


1010
00:53:34.181 --> 00:53:36.016
You all know that.

1011
00:53:37.685 --> 00:53:40.063
So, I guess when you find out
what these kids are going through,


1012
00:53:40.087 --> 00:53:41.287
it's hard not to do something.

1013
00:53:42.089 --> 00:53:43.289
But it's a really big problem.

1014
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:44.892
Over one million kids.

1015
00:53:46.093 --> 00:53:47.973
I can't even put that
in my head. That's like...


1016
00:53:49.563 --> 00:53:52.366
Raymond James Stadium 15 times
overfilled with kids without homes.


1017
00:53:52.466 --> 00:53:54.368
So, you ask yourself,

1018
00:53:54.468 --> 00:53:56.904
"How can only
one person help?"


1019
00:53:57.004 --> 00:54:01.041
So, you got together and created your
own foundation to help these kids.


1020
00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:02.677
That's so cool!

1021
00:54:05.612 --> 00:54:07.223
And now you're probably
looking at me and thinking,


1022
00:54:07.247 --> 00:54:09.116
"How can this one
little kid help?"


1023
00:54:09.216 --> 00:54:10.718
But the way I see it,

1024
00:54:10.818 --> 00:54:12.720
it's like cleaning your room.

1025
00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:16.123
Whenever it's really messy
and too big of a problem,


1026
00:54:16.223 --> 00:54:17.925
you ignore it.

1027
00:54:18.025 --> 00:54:19.025
You shut the door on it,

1028
00:54:19.059 --> 00:54:22.062
you shove it
under the bed, whatever.


1029
00:54:22.162 --> 00:54:24.932
But if you pick one small spot,

1030
00:54:25.032 --> 00:54:27.868
work on it, then another,
eventually it gets done.


1031
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:31.238
My mom taught me that.

1032
00:54:34.842 --> 00:54:36.953
That's how I think we should go
about with helping these kids.


1033
00:54:36.977 --> 00:54:38.679
So my small part

1034
00:54:38.779 --> 00:54:42.082
is to walk to our
state capital in Tallahassee.


1035
00:54:42.182 --> 00:54:45.285
Along the way, I hope to speak
to schools and media outlets


1036
00:54:45.385 --> 00:54:48.088
to raise awareness
about the homeless kids.


1037
00:54:48.188 --> 00:54:50.024
So, I'll pick up
the dirty clothes,


1038
00:54:50.124 --> 00:54:53.127
and you guys put away
the toys or make the bed.


1039
00:54:54.995 --> 00:54:58.165
One day, our room will be clean.

1040
00:54:58.265 --> 00:55:02.269
And one day, there won't be
any more homeless kids to help.


1041
00:55:07.041 --> 00:55:08.075
Thank you.

1042
00:55:22.823 --> 00:55:27.194
I move that we see if we
can get that RV for him


1043
00:55:27.294 --> 00:55:32.199
and donate $1,000 from
the fund to Zach's walk.


1044
00:55:32.299 --> 00:55:34.802
Do we have a second
to that motion?


1045
00:55:34.902 --> 00:55:36.336
Seconded!

1046
00:55:36.436 --> 00:55:38.973
You know what?
$1,000 isn't gonna do it.


1047
00:55:39.807 --> 00:55:40.975
Here you go, Zach.

1048
00:55:42.242 --> 00:55:43.878
Anyone else?

1049
00:55:49.784 --> 00:55:51.952
- Good luck, kid.
- Thanks.


1050
00:55:54.354 --> 00:55:56.723
Thank you. Thank you.

1051
00:55:56.824 --> 00:55:57.958
Come on.

1052
00:55:58.826 --> 00:55:59.927
Did you think...

1053
00:56:00.928 --> 00:56:03.230
Yeah, he... He wouldn't
be able to do it, huh?


1054
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:07.134
Well, I mean, did you think that he'd
be able to do it? But look at him.


1055
00:56:07.234 --> 00:56:09.169
- Thank you.
- It's unbelievable.


1056
00:56:09.269 --> 00:56:11.738
Thank you. Thank you.

1057
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:16.376
Kel...

1058
00:56:18.278 --> 00:56:20.347
Look, I'm so sorry.

1059
00:56:20.447 --> 00:56:24.384
I know that you're disappointed.

1060
00:56:24.484 --> 00:56:28.989
But we can always do those cooking
classes next summer, all right?


1061
00:56:29.089 --> 00:56:30.357
Come on.

1062
00:56:32.092 --> 00:56:33.327
Sure.

1063
00:56:41.936 --> 00:56:43.804
Hmm, it's not a done deal yet.

1064
00:56:43.904 --> 00:56:46.273
I still have to figure out
how we survive.


1065
00:56:47.007 --> 00:56:49.977
But you can do it, right?

1066
00:56:51.178 --> 00:56:53.147
I'll give it my best.

1067
00:56:53.247 --> 00:56:54.849
That's all I can tell you.

1068
00:56:58.285 --> 00:56:59.553
Teeth.

1069
00:57:10.264 --> 00:57:12.900
Where do you think you're going?
Anywhere but here.


1070
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.236
Um, no, you're not.
You're 16.


1071
00:57:16.336 --> 00:57:18.472
17 in a month.

1072
00:57:18.572 --> 00:57:21.808
I call the cops, they'll
drag you right back here.


1073
00:57:23.878 --> 00:57:25.045
You wouldn't.

1074
00:57:25.145 --> 00:57:26.881
You wanna try me?

1075
00:57:28.548 --> 00:57:31.518
Look, Kelley,
I know you're upset.


1076
00:57:31.618 --> 00:57:34.922
Upset? Upset?
You promised!


1077
00:57:35.022 --> 00:57:36.556
It was a plan.
Plans change.


1078
00:57:36.656 --> 00:57:40.094
Life does that to us
all the time. I had plans.


1079
00:57:40.194 --> 00:57:42.029
All sorts of plans.

1080
00:57:42.129 --> 00:57:43.473
I made the best out
of what was dealt me.


1081
00:57:43.497 --> 00:57:45.065
Really?
Yes.


1082
00:57:45.165 --> 00:57:49.203
Does your life suck?
Because mine sucks!


1083
00:57:49.303 --> 00:57:50.871
Are you kidding me?

1084
00:57:52.206 --> 00:57:53.941
Mom.
Zach...


1085
00:57:54.041 --> 00:57:55.976
I want you to
go to bed right now.


1086
00:57:56.076 --> 00:57:58.145
But... Right now, I don't care.
Go ahead.


1087
00:57:58.245 --> 00:57:59.546
Go in there right now.

1088
00:58:00.347 --> 00:58:01.581
Right now.

1089
00:58:04.251 --> 00:58:07.221
So your life sucks, huh?

1090
00:58:07.321 --> 00:58:08.622
Do you want for anything?

1091
00:58:09.323 --> 00:58:10.624
No.

1092
00:58:10.724 --> 00:58:13.593
I provide for your every need,

1093
00:58:13.693 --> 00:58:16.096
for your every little whim.

1094
00:58:16.196 --> 00:58:17.965
Girl, poke your head

1095
00:58:18.065 --> 00:58:19.633
out of that
sheltered life of yours


1096
00:58:19.733 --> 00:58:22.069
and take a look
at mine for a second.


1097
00:58:22.169 --> 00:58:24.972
I am the sole provider
for this family.


1098
00:58:25.072 --> 00:58:28.976
Every day I have to find a way
to keep our heads above water.


1099
00:58:29.076 --> 00:58:32.146
Every day,
whether we eat or not,


1100
00:58:32.246 --> 00:58:35.649
it is all on me and some days,
that is plain bone crushing.


1101
00:58:36.283 --> 00:58:37.651
But I do it.

1102
00:58:37.751 --> 00:58:41.288
Is that why you're trying
to ruin my life?


1103
00:58:41.388 --> 00:58:44.391
Because yours is so pathetic?

1104
00:58:44.491 --> 00:58:46.994
My life is in no way
pathetic, Kelley,


1105
00:58:47.094 --> 00:58:50.998
and I'm so sorry
it seems that way to you.


1106
00:58:51.098 --> 00:58:54.301
Yes, maybe before this
I was just treading water,


1107
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:59.539
before Zach started on his...
His mission here.


1108
00:58:59.639 --> 00:59:01.641
But this has
given him a purpose,


1109
00:59:02.409 --> 00:59:04.078
a dream.

1110
00:59:04.178 --> 00:59:05.612
For me, too.

1111
00:59:05.712 --> 00:59:09.916
And maybe just once, instead of
only thinking about yourself,


1112
00:59:10.017 --> 00:59:13.487
maybe just once you could
think about climbing aboard.


1113
00:59:13.587 --> 00:59:15.055
You know what?

1114
00:59:15.155 --> 00:59:17.424
I don't give
a damn about his dream!


1115
00:59:17.524 --> 00:59:19.359
My life is a nightmare!

1116
00:59:19.459 --> 00:59:20.736
You better watch it, young lady.

1117
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.196
I will not!

1118
00:59:22.296 --> 00:59:25.165
You will watch it in my house!

1119
00:59:27.267 --> 00:59:29.603
You wanna grow up so fast?

1120
00:59:29.703 --> 00:59:32.239
Well, every once in a
while, us grown-ups,


1121
00:59:32.339 --> 00:59:33.573
more than we'd like,

1122
00:59:33.673 --> 00:59:35.575
have to suck it up and move on.

1123
00:59:35.675 --> 00:59:38.712
So get your butt
back in your room.


1124
00:59:44.451 --> 00:59:47.054
Clean that up.
You clean it up!


1125
00:59:57.597 --> 01:00:00.400
Listen to me.

1126
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:04.604
You don't get the life
you want, you know.


1127
01:00:04.704 --> 01:00:07.374
You get what comes
down the line.


1128
01:00:07.474 --> 01:00:10.510
You live with that
or you be miserable.


1129
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.346
It is your choice.

1130
01:00:38.272 --> 01:00:39.573
Kelley?

1131
01:00:47.381 --> 01:00:48.682
You mad at me?

1132
01:00:51.518 --> 01:00:53.120
What do you think?

1133
01:00:57.357 --> 01:01:00.026
You wouldn't really go,
would you?


1134
01:01:02.162 --> 01:01:04.664
I didn't pack for a vacation.

1135
01:01:04.764 --> 01:01:07.501
But I don't want you
to go. Ever.


1136
01:01:07.601 --> 01:01:09.169
I'm gonna go someday.

1137
01:01:10.604 --> 01:01:12.472
So will you.

1138
01:01:12.572 --> 01:01:13.807
We're in this together.

1139
01:01:13.907 --> 01:01:16.676
We're a team.
The Dynamic Trio.


1140
01:01:16.776 --> 01:01:19.313
Us against the world.

1141
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:24.218
You remember that?

1142
01:01:25.152 --> 01:01:26.353
You were so little.

1143
01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:29.055
I still am little.

1144
01:01:29.156 --> 01:01:33.360
Don't give me that
"puppy dog Zach" act.


1145
01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.263
You can play everyone
else, including Mom,


1146
01:01:36.363 --> 01:01:38.198
but you can't play your sister.

1147
01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:41.568
Sorry.

1148
01:01:42.502 --> 01:01:44.271
But this would be fun, Kel.

1149
01:01:44.371 --> 01:01:47.607
I was thinking you'd be like
the publicity whatchamacallit.


1150
01:01:47.707 --> 01:01:51.111
You know, calling the
newspaper and the radio people,


1151
01:01:51.211 --> 01:01:53.780
and the TV stations
during the walk.


1152
01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.350
I bet you'll like it
much more than the cooking.


1153
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.585
You never quit, do you?

1154
01:01:58.685 --> 01:02:00.154
What do you mean?

1155
01:02:01.321 --> 01:02:03.223
Go all innocent on me.

1156
01:02:06.393 --> 01:02:09.163
You're such a selfish
little jerk sometimes.


1157
01:02:15.169 --> 01:02:18.605
I wish I cared about
something as much as you do.


1158
01:02:22.542 --> 01:02:24.178
But I don't.

1159
01:02:25.679 --> 01:02:27.147
So I just...

1160
01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:31.385
People walk all over me
like a doormat.


1161
01:02:32.952 --> 01:02:35.355
But you're not a doormat.

1162
01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:39.859
Yeah, I am.

1163
01:03:07.221 --> 01:03:08.555
Hey.

1164
01:03:08.655 --> 01:03:10.690
Mom said to come eat breakfast.

1165
01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:13.460
She make biscuits?
Yep.


1166
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.696
She thinks she can
buy me with biscuits.


1167
01:03:16.796 --> 01:03:18.898
Well, that works for me.

1168
01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:24.804
Hey...
Look, I was thinking...


1169
01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:33.413
I guess I could be your
publicity whatchamacallit, okay?


1170
01:03:33.513 --> 01:03:35.682
Really?

1171
01:03:35.782 --> 01:03:38.418
Thank you so much. Thank
you, thank you, thank you.


1172
01:03:41.421 --> 01:03:43.790
This will be fun, Kel.
You watch.


1173
01:03:47.494 --> 01:03:48.962
Hey, Mom, guess what?

1174
01:03:50.297 --> 01:03:51.698
Guess what?

1175
01:03:59.706 --> 01:04:00.907
Hey.

1176
01:04:04.444 --> 01:04:05.879
Did you get a new
driver's license?


1177
01:04:05.979 --> 01:04:08.782
There's a $10 fee.

1178
01:04:08.882 --> 01:04:10.717
Hey, I was in the line
and I was thinking,


1179
01:04:10.817 --> 01:04:12.952
"What else could
we get with $10?"


1180
01:04:13.052 --> 01:04:15.989
A couple of meals, enough
gas to get us somewhere else.


1181
01:04:16.089 --> 01:04:18.592
And then I was thinking...
Somewhere else?


1182
01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:20.527
Where?

1183
01:04:20.627 --> 01:04:23.997
Do you remember Daddy talked about
that aunt he had up in Waukeenah?


1184
01:04:24.698 --> 01:04:26.866
Um, yeah.

1185
01:04:26.966 --> 01:04:30.003
Well, I haven't communicated with
her for ages, but she was so nice.


1186
01:04:30.103 --> 01:04:32.472
She really liked me.

1187
01:04:32.572 --> 01:04:35.008
I don't know. What do you think?
We could go up there and...


1188
01:04:37.877 --> 01:04:39.613
Let's do it.

1189
01:04:39.713 --> 01:04:40.914
Really?
Yeah.


1190
01:04:41.815 --> 01:04:42.982
You'll like her.

1191
01:04:43.082 --> 01:04:44.984
Really?
Yeah, she's funny.


1192
01:04:58.898 --> 01:05:00.834
Come on.

1193
01:05:06.606 --> 01:05:07.907
May I help you?

1194
01:05:08.007 --> 01:05:09.776
I'm looking for Cynthia McHugh.

1195
01:05:09.876 --> 01:05:11.845
Uh, I'm sorry.
I tried calling earlier,


1196
01:05:11.945 --> 01:05:14.848
but she must have changed
the number or something.


1197
01:05:14.948 --> 01:05:16.716
Is she at home?

1198
01:05:16.816 --> 01:05:18.885
Um, I don't know
a Cynthia McHugh.


1199
01:05:18.985 --> 01:05:20.454
Well, she...

1200
01:05:21.921 --> 01:05:23.323
She used to live here.

1201
01:05:23.423 --> 01:05:25.792
I just moved but
six months ago myself.


1202
01:05:25.892 --> 01:05:27.661
I'm sorry.

1203
01:05:27.761 --> 01:05:28.995
Did she, um...

1204
01:05:29.095 --> 01:05:30.455
Did she leave
a forwarding address?


1205
01:05:31.698 --> 01:05:32.899
No.

1206
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:35.969
Thank you.

1207
01:05:42.642 --> 01:05:46.012
You know, he may have coined
the term Little Red Wagon


1208
01:05:46.112 --> 01:05:49.816
from his vibrant red hair,

1209
01:05:49.916 --> 01:05:52.419
as well as his
vibrant red wagon.


1210
01:05:54.721 --> 01:05:56.956
But, uh, he is
probably the youngest


1211
01:05:58.692 --> 01:06:01.995
founder, president of any non-profit
organization that you'll ever meet.


1212
01:06:02.095 --> 01:06:03.697
Quite a remarkable young man,

1213
01:06:05.031 --> 01:06:06.711
and of course, I am
speaking of Zach Bonner


1214
01:06:06.966 --> 01:06:08.406
with the Little
Red Wagon Foundation.


1215
01:06:12.138 --> 01:06:13.707
Zach is being tracked.

1216
01:06:15.141 --> 01:06:16.141
I say young man...

1217
01:06:16.209 --> 01:06:17.644
Look at this, Zach.

1218
01:06:18.712 --> 01:06:21.615
All these people.

1219
01:06:21.715 --> 01:06:24.117
All this commotion.

1220
01:06:24.217 --> 01:06:26.720
Look what you started
with your little red wagon.


1221
01:06:28.688 --> 01:06:30.524
You've done something

1222
01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:32.859
remarkable.

1223
01:06:34.093 --> 01:06:37.030
Just give yourself a minute
and take it all in.


1224
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:39.466
Not only does
he do these good works,


1225
01:06:39.566 --> 01:06:42.368
but he also inspires
others to help him


1226
01:06:42.469 --> 01:06:45.739
and to do these good works themselves.
Very admirable.


1227
01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:49.509
Kel, I think you should get
to the first rendezvous point.


1228
01:06:49.609 --> 01:06:51.978
Can't I wait until
the ribbon cutting?


1229
01:06:52.078 --> 01:06:54.748
Oh, of course.
Of course.


1230
01:06:54.848 --> 01:06:56.015
Then you should get going.

1231
01:06:56.115 --> 01:06:57.851
Hey, I'm driving,
you're walking.


1232
01:06:57.951 --> 01:06:59.595
Who's gonna get there first?
Duh. Okay, okay.


1233
01:06:59.619 --> 01:07:01.688
Kelley, listen to me.

1234
01:07:01.788 --> 01:07:03.690
This is gonna be hard

1235
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:05.625
on all of us, okay?

1236
01:07:05.725 --> 01:07:09.128
But it has become bigger
than just you and me.


1237
01:07:09.228 --> 01:07:11.831
So let's just try our best,

1238
01:07:11.931 --> 01:07:13.633
and get along.

1239
01:07:13.733 --> 01:07:15.702
I will make an effort
if you will.


1240
01:07:15.802 --> 01:07:17.771
Yes, I'm sorry, all right?

1241
01:07:17.871 --> 01:07:19.873
Okay.
Okay.


1242
01:07:19.973 --> 01:07:22.642
The state of Florida
is walking with him,


1243
01:07:22.742 --> 01:07:25.712
and I am walking with him
every step of the way.


1244
01:07:25.812 --> 01:07:26.846
Yeah!

1245
01:08:05.118 --> 01:08:08.054
Bonner! Bonner! Bonner!

1246
01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:29.108
Yeah!

1247
01:08:35.782 --> 01:08:38.952
Look at that, it's really pretty.
Yeah.


1248
01:08:39.052 --> 01:08:42.255
I'd like to be
in a boat out there.


1249
01:08:42.355 --> 01:08:45.659
All these items look like
they belong to old folks.


1250
01:08:48.595 --> 01:08:50.155
They look like
they belong to old folks?


1251
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:51.898
They probably do
belong to old folks.


1252
01:08:51.998 --> 01:08:54.000
At some point they were...

1253
01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.902
Young people...
somebody's...


1254
01:08:56.002 --> 01:08:57.203
How you guys doing?

1255
01:08:57.303 --> 01:08:59.038
Oh, we're doing all right,
aren't we, Zach?


1256
01:08:59.138 --> 01:09:01.240
But you know what? We need
to refresh the bug juice.


1257
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.743
Those flies are mean out there.

1258
01:09:03.843 --> 01:09:05.612
And, uh...
You know what?


1259
01:09:05.712 --> 01:09:08.014
You need to put more
sunblock on and then hydrate.


1260
01:09:08.114 --> 01:09:10.650
Yeah, I've been keeping
the water cold on ice.


1261
01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:11.818
Thank you.

1262
01:09:11.918 --> 01:09:13.152
Zach, how you doing?

1263
01:09:13.252 --> 01:09:15.989
On the way here, we saw a crow

1264
01:09:16.089 --> 01:09:17.290
with a lizard in its claws.

1265
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:18.958
- No way.
- We did.


1266
01:09:19.058 --> 01:09:21.027
Or it could've been
a baby alligator.


1267
01:09:21.127 --> 01:09:22.295
That's so cool.

1268
01:09:22.395 --> 01:09:23.863
You think?
Oh! Oh, um...


1269
01:09:23.963 --> 01:09:25.965
Do you want us to move
the next stop closer


1270
01:09:26.065 --> 01:09:28.702
or keep it where we planned?

1271
01:09:28.802 --> 01:09:30.570
No, I think we're okay.
Right, Zach?


1272
01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:31.905
- I'm good.
- Yeah?


1273
01:09:32.005 --> 01:09:33.573
We're good.

1274
01:09:33.673 --> 01:09:35.909
Oh, you know what?
Did you get the Tampa papers?


1275
01:09:36.009 --> 01:09:37.677
Yeah, they're right here.
Oh, good.


1276
01:09:37.777 --> 01:09:40.079
Can you believe it? That
they spelled my name wrong?


1277
01:09:40.179 --> 01:09:42.649
Oh, terrible!
That's awful.


1278
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:43.783
Hey!

1279
01:09:44.718 --> 01:09:45.761
I told them how to
spell your name right.


1280
01:09:45.785 --> 01:09:47.029
It's not a big deal, honey.
It is a big deal!


1281
01:09:47.053 --> 01:09:48.622
Oh, come on.

1282
01:09:48.655 --> 01:09:51.157
No, it is a big deal.
It's my name!


1283
01:09:51.257 --> 01:09:54.127
Kelley. K
-E
-L
-L
-E
-Y.

1284
01:09:54.227 --> 01:09:56.229
E
-Y! It's not a big deal.

1285
01:09:56.329 --> 01:09:58.331
- And they're like, "L-Y".
- It's...


1286
01:09:58.431 --> 01:10:00.242
Oh, come on. Do you want me...
How hard is that?


1287
01:10:00.266 --> 01:10:02.235
Do you want me to call the editor?
I will.


1288
01:10:02.335 --> 01:10:04.179
I will call him tomorrow and I will say...
What are they gonna do?


1289
01:10:04.203 --> 01:10:06.139
"Listen, Mr. Man, you
put her name K-E-L-L-E-Y


1290
01:10:06.239 --> 01:10:08.417
"in big bold print letters and big
picture and it'll be really pretty."


1291
01:10:08.441 --> 01:10:10.109
I see what you're doing. Sorry.

1292
01:10:13.813 --> 01:10:15.815
Vented. I'm okay.

1293
01:10:15.915 --> 01:10:18.618
All right. Let's
hydrate and keep on.


1294
01:10:18.718 --> 01:10:21.054
- Zach, do you need to pee?
- Take your water.


1295
01:10:21.154 --> 01:10:22.355
Zach?

1296
01:10:24.658 --> 01:10:26.626
I guess he doesn't need to pee.

1297
01:10:26.726 --> 01:10:27.727
I do,

1298
01:10:27.827 --> 01:10:29.796
but I guess that doesn't matter.

1299
01:10:29.896 --> 01:10:31.741
I'll see you at the next one.
I'll see you at the next...


1300
01:10:31.765 --> 01:10:33.366
Bye. Bye.

1301
01:10:41.975 --> 01:10:43.810
Oh, sweet! A dollar.

1302
01:10:52.285 --> 01:10:54.788
Ugh! Gross!

1303
01:10:54.888 --> 01:10:56.622
What's that smell?

1304
01:10:56.923 --> 01:10:58.357
Ugh!

1305
01:10:58.457 --> 01:11:00.326
I think it's a dead cat!

1306
01:11:00.426 --> 01:11:01.861
Just go into the next one.

1307
01:11:05.098 --> 01:11:06.800
Jackpot, Mom!

1308
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:07.900
Be careful.

1309
01:11:07.967 --> 01:11:08.967
Look what I got!

1310
01:11:09.002 --> 01:11:10.002
Oh!

1311
01:11:14.974 --> 01:11:16.009
Oh!

1312
01:11:17.811 --> 01:11:20.013
Are you okay?

1313
01:11:21.214 --> 01:11:23.016
Okay, it's okay,
it's gonna be okay.


1314
01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:25.151
Let me check.

1315
01:11:25.885 --> 01:11:27.754
Oh, I'm sorry.

1316
01:11:27.854 --> 01:11:30.790
Just let me take a look. Just
let me take a little look.


1317
01:11:32.225 --> 01:11:34.761
Okay, come on.
We're gonna go, okay?


1318
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:37.196
We're gonna go.

1319
01:11:37.296 --> 01:11:38.898
What's a profit?

1320
01:11:38.998 --> 01:11:41.167
I have no idea.

1321
01:11:41.267 --> 01:11:43.269
Probably, like, a spice.

1322
01:11:44.437 --> 01:11:45.805
With all that money...

1323
01:11:45.905 --> 01:11:47.741
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi.


1324
01:11:49.042 --> 01:11:51.077
Oh, I swear,

1325
01:11:51.177 --> 01:11:53.179
every bone in my body hurts.

1326
01:11:54.247 --> 01:11:57.383
Well, dinner
on the table for you


1327
01:11:57.483 --> 01:12:01.087
and here's some
epsom salts for your feet.


1328
01:12:01.187 --> 01:12:02.989
What?

1329
01:12:03.089 --> 01:12:06.459
Kelley, I think you're an angel.

1330
01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:08.394
I do.

1331
01:12:08.494 --> 01:12:10.005
I got some coming up
for you, too, Zach.


1332
01:12:10.029 --> 01:12:13.733
I take back every bad thing
I ever said about you.


1333
01:12:13.833 --> 01:12:15.835
Aw, thanks.

1334
01:12:15.935 --> 01:12:18.972
Well, we did it.

1335
01:12:19.072 --> 01:12:20.206
One day down.

1336
01:12:20.306 --> 01:12:21.474
Quite a few more to go.

1337
01:12:21.574 --> 01:12:23.342
But we don't look
at it like that,


1338
01:12:24.210 --> 01:12:26.179
we take it one day at a time,

1339
01:12:26.279 --> 01:12:28.815
one mile at a time,

1340
01:12:28.915 --> 01:12:30.884
one foot in front of the other.

1341
01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:33.286
Right, Zach?

1342
01:12:37.056 --> 01:12:38.291
Oh!
Zach?


1343
01:12:43.029 --> 01:12:44.363
It's chicken in his hand.

1344
01:12:44.463 --> 01:12:46.232
Oh, that's not cool.

1345
01:12:47.133 --> 01:12:48.367
Okay.

1346
01:12:52.839 --> 01:12:55.274
Here you go.
Cover him with this.


1347
01:13:28.875 --> 01:13:30.309
Excuse me.

1348
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:32.511
Excuse me.

1349
01:13:32.611 --> 01:13:34.113
Excuse me.

1350
01:13:34.213 --> 01:13:36.315
We have been waiting
six and a half hours.


1351
01:13:36.415 --> 01:13:38.017
When are we gonna see a doctor?

1352
01:13:38.117 --> 01:13:39.886
Ma'am, we take
the priority cases first.


1353
01:13:39.986 --> 01:13:42.155
Priority? My son
could have a concussion.


1354
01:13:42.255 --> 01:13:43.857
His arm could be broken.

1355
01:13:43.957 --> 01:13:46.425
Priority here means
life or death.


1356
01:13:46.525 --> 01:13:48.470
There are patients here who
have waited longer than you.


1357
01:13:48.494 --> 01:13:50.296
But he's a kid.

1358
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:52.098
He's a kid.

1359
01:13:54.067 --> 01:13:55.434
I'm sorry.

1360
01:14:29.335 --> 01:14:31.337
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1361
01:14:31.437 --> 01:14:33.439
Wait, wait.
Let me get some ice.


1362
01:14:35.574 --> 01:14:37.243
There's more.

1363
01:14:37.343 --> 01:14:38.878
Oh!

1364
01:14:40.079 --> 01:14:41.480
Is it good?

1365
01:14:43.082 --> 01:14:45.418
I would not.
No, thank you.


1366
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.956
Yes, Mr. Senator.

1367
01:14:50.056 --> 01:14:53.592
Well, I do believe you should be there
around 2:00 or 3:00 p.m., I would say.


1368
01:15:10.977 --> 01:15:12.245
You all right?

1369
01:15:12.345 --> 01:15:15.114
Oh! Oh, honey, honey.

1370
01:15:15.214 --> 01:15:18.251
Zach? Oh, Zach!
Oh, honey. Oh!


1371
01:15:18.351 --> 01:15:20.886
Oh, babe.
All right. Okay.


1372
01:15:20.987 --> 01:15:23.522
Wait. Let's go find Kel.
She's over here. Come on.


1373
01:15:37.036 --> 01:15:38.537
Hey, Zach?

1374
01:15:38.637 --> 01:15:41.140
I think we should call it a day.

1375
01:15:41.707 --> 01:15:43.442
Okay?

1376
01:15:43.542 --> 01:15:47.013
You've done so many miles...
No! We can't cheat.


1377
01:15:49.182 --> 01:15:51.917
The homeless
don't get a day off.


1378
01:16:12.138 --> 01:16:14.940
All right. I'll meet you
at the next rest stop.


1379
01:16:15.041 --> 01:16:16.075
Okay.

1380
01:16:21.347 --> 01:16:23.416
All right, buddy?

1381
01:16:23.516 --> 01:16:25.618
Take it slow, okay?

1382
01:17:21.507 --> 01:17:22.575
I beat you.
All right.


1383
01:17:29.282 --> 01:17:30.383
Mrs. Bonner!

1384
01:17:30.483 --> 01:17:31.784
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.


1385
01:17:31.884 --> 01:17:33.086
Hi. Coach Kelly.
Hi.


1386
01:17:33.186 --> 01:17:36.422
Um, the girls... We were wondering
if we could walk with Zach?


1387
01:17:36.522 --> 01:17:38.424
You know, they want
to do their part.


1388
01:17:38.524 --> 01:17:40.659
Uh, sure, I guess.

1389
01:17:40.759 --> 01:17:42.795
How... How did you
find out about us?


1390
01:17:42.895 --> 01:17:44.130
Um, well, we've actually...

1391
01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:45.698
We've been using
the Zach Tracker


1392
01:17:45.798 --> 01:17:48.101
and we've been following
you guys since Tampa.


1393
01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:49.335
Oh, really?

1394
01:17:49.435 --> 01:17:51.537
The Zach Tracker,
isn't that nice?


1395
01:17:51.637 --> 01:17:54.407
So, what do you say, Zach?

1396
01:17:54.507 --> 01:17:56.309
Sure, I guess.

1397
01:17:59.178 --> 01:18:00.613
All right.

1398
01:18:00.713 --> 01:18:02.281
Let's go.

1399
01:18:03.816 --> 01:18:05.151
Ha!

1400
01:18:05.251 --> 01:18:08.421
Very interesting.
Nice work, chick magnet.


1401
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:13.292
Quite a show.
Sure?


1402
01:18:13.392 --> 01:18:14.693
Like how you want it.

1403
01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:19.098
Look, where are we going?

1404
01:18:19.198 --> 01:18:20.733
We need to get you
something to eat.


1405
01:18:20.833 --> 01:18:23.702
But we don't have any money.
I know that!


1406
01:18:23.802 --> 01:18:25.604
Oh, I'm sorry.

1407
01:18:30.143 --> 01:18:31.810
We're gonna steal some food?

1408
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:33.812
I'm gonna do what I have to do.

1409
01:18:35.514 --> 01:18:37.316
Come on, come on.

1410
01:18:43.322 --> 01:18:44.757
Here we go.

1411
01:18:45.591 --> 01:18:47.193
What do you want? Uh...

1412
01:18:47.293 --> 01:18:50.363
Tuna, ham and cheese,
veggie roll?


1413
01:18:50.463 --> 01:18:52.331
Um, the tuna?

1414
01:18:56.335 --> 01:18:57.370
Come on, come on.

1415
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:59.838
Aren't you gonna
get one for you?


1416
01:19:13.452 --> 01:19:14.520
Does that look weird?

1417
01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:15.788
No. Come on.

1418
01:19:43.582 --> 01:19:44.917
What's wrong, Momma?

1419
01:19:46.885 --> 01:19:49.422
We're not these kind of people.

1420
01:19:51.457 --> 01:19:53.392
We're not. Stay there.

1421
01:20:03.636 --> 01:20:05.438
Oh, Lord.

1422
01:20:07.806 --> 01:20:10.209
What am I supposed to do?

1423
01:20:23.756 --> 01:20:25.324
Here, honey.

1424
01:20:26.392 --> 01:20:27.726
Come on.

1425
01:20:32.365 --> 01:20:33.832
We're the homeless,

1426
01:20:33.932 --> 01:20:35.434
those who have nothing.

1427
01:20:35.534 --> 01:20:37.870
A small thing that
we take for granted,


1428
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:40.573
a book, clean underwear,

1429
01:20:40.673 --> 01:20:43.976
or a simple toy can give
them just a little happiness.


1430
01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:47.246
Maybe for only a moment.

1431
01:20:47.346 --> 01:20:51.384
Sometimes the smallest act of
kindness can change a person's life.


1432
01:20:51.484 --> 01:20:54.420
Or it could be the one thing that
gives them enough hope to go on,


1433
01:20:54.987 --> 01:20:56.955
or to start again.

1434
01:21:02.328 --> 01:21:03.429
Okay.

1435
01:21:03.529 --> 01:21:04.863
Thursday...

1436
01:21:43.802 --> 01:21:45.704
You have to make your own bed,

1437
01:21:45.804 --> 01:21:47.048
turn in the linens
in the morning,


1438
01:21:47.072 --> 01:21:49.742
and in case you get cold you're
gonna have a couple of those.


1439
01:21:49.842 --> 01:21:50.843
Thank you.

1440
01:21:50.943 --> 01:21:52.745
And I have something for you.

1441
01:21:52.845 --> 01:21:54.847
We have a couple of these left.

1442
01:21:54.947 --> 01:21:55.981
What's this?

1443
01:21:56.081 --> 01:21:57.683
They call 'em Zach Packs.

1444
01:21:57.783 --> 01:21:59.794
Some kid puts them together
and that one's yours to keep.


1445
01:21:59.818 --> 01:22:00.986
Thanks.
You're welcome.


1446
01:22:01.086 --> 01:22:02.621
Okay. Why don't you
follow me this way


1447
01:22:02.721 --> 01:22:04.957
and I'll show you
to your room. All right?


1448
01:22:05.057 --> 01:22:06.459
Go ahead and get settled in.

1449
01:22:06.559 --> 01:22:08.527
Take your time, but
dinner's in about an hour.


1450
01:22:08.627 --> 01:22:10.929
Okay? So why don't you
come down to the dining hall.


1451
01:22:11.029 --> 01:22:12.064
All right?
Thank you.


1452
01:22:12.164 --> 01:22:13.532
Okay, thanks.
Here you go.


1453
01:22:13.632 --> 01:22:14.900
Thanks.

1454
01:22:17.836 --> 01:22:19.672
Mom, look, there's food.

1455
01:22:19.772 --> 01:22:21.674
Chef Boyardee.

1456
01:22:21.774 --> 01:22:23.542
Um...

1457
01:22:24.109 --> 01:22:25.611
Candy,

1458
01:22:28.414 --> 01:22:29.982
deodorant, soap...

1459
01:22:30.082 --> 01:22:32.050
Oh, can I see?
Yeah.


1460
01:22:34.853 --> 01:22:36.822
Some cool comic.

1461
01:22:41.126 --> 01:22:44.096
"Kid Fuel."

1462
01:22:46.699 --> 01:22:48.601
Oh, man! Socks.

1463
01:22:52.505 --> 01:22:54.573
Mom, look, a yo-yo!

1464
01:22:55.674 --> 01:22:57.443
Remember that yo-yo Dad gave me?

1465
01:22:57.543 --> 01:22:58.611
That lit up.

1466
01:22:59.478 --> 01:23:00.879
Oh, I loved that.

1467
01:23:00.979 --> 01:23:03.782
I may need to borrow
some of this toothpaste.


1468
01:23:03.882 --> 01:23:05.884
Is that okay?
Sure.


1469
01:23:08.621 --> 01:23:10.856
Look, Spider
-Man.

1470
01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:14.393
Wow!

1471
01:23:14.493 --> 01:23:15.260
Yeah.

1472
01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.930
And I can do a lap
around the world.


1473
01:23:18.897 --> 01:23:21.667
Good job!
Thanks.


1474
01:23:21.767 --> 01:23:23.402
Oh, man.
This is tough.


1475
01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:25.871
There. There.

1476
01:23:27.172 --> 01:23:29.074
Hold on.
I can do it.


1477
01:23:38.951 --> 01:23:41.019
So...

1478
01:23:41.119 --> 01:23:43.121
What do you wanna talk about?

1479
01:23:43.221 --> 01:23:45.090
I'm talked out.

1480
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:47.760
No, we got Greek myths.

1481
01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.162
Um...

1482
01:23:50.262 --> 01:23:53.098
Stupid human tricks?
Mom, I'm talked out.


1483
01:23:56.001 --> 01:23:57.402
You okay?

1484
01:23:57.503 --> 01:23:59.672
Yeah, I'm just talked out.

1485
01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:02.908
Okay.

1486
01:24:03.976 --> 01:24:05.878
Well...

1487
01:24:05.978 --> 01:24:08.218
I was hoping you could amuse
me some, but... Mom, please.


1488
01:24:08.246 --> 01:24:09.748
Oh. All right,
all right.


1489
01:24:09.848 --> 01:24:12.417
If you're too worn out, then...

1490
01:24:49.688 --> 01:24:50.723
Hey.

1491
01:24:52.057 --> 01:24:53.726
You ready?
Yeah.


1492
01:24:53.826 --> 01:24:56.066
Do you wanna get something to eat?
Are you... You hungry?


1493
01:24:56.128 --> 01:24:58.030
Mmm, okay.
Okay.


1494
01:24:59.965 --> 01:25:02.100
What you so happy about?

1495
01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.969
I got a job.

1496
01:25:04.069 --> 01:25:05.170
A job?
Yes!


1497
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:06.872
Really? No way!
I did. Yes!


1498
01:25:08.641 --> 01:25:10.643
Come on.

1499
01:25:12.778 --> 01:25:14.747
Here.

1500
01:25:14.847 --> 01:25:17.287
People at the Hope Center got
me an interview, just temp work,


1501
01:25:17.349 --> 01:25:19.852
but it could be
a permanent thing.


1502
01:25:19.952 --> 01:25:21.820
Depends on how I perform.

1503
01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.922
Thank you. Sorry.

1504
01:25:24.022 --> 01:25:25.123
You'll be great.

1505
01:25:25.223 --> 01:25:26.959
Really?
Yeah.


1506
01:25:27.059 --> 01:25:29.037
First thing we gotta do
is get you back into school.


1507
01:25:29.061 --> 01:25:30.228
Okay.
Get you registered.


1508
01:25:30.328 --> 01:25:32.030
But where're we gonna live?

1509
01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:33.766
I'm working on that, too.

1510
01:25:37.135 --> 01:25:39.004
You know what?

1511
01:25:39.104 --> 01:25:40.873
I think we're gonna be okay.

1512
01:25:40.973 --> 01:25:42.741
I mean, I really do.

1513
01:25:42.841 --> 01:25:44.877
Yeah.

1514
01:25:44.977 --> 01:25:47.546
I know it's been
hard on you, but...


1515
01:25:47.646 --> 01:25:49.682
I think your dad
would be so proud,


1516
01:25:49.782 --> 01:25:53.151
how you got through all this.

1517
01:25:53.251 --> 01:25:55.588
Do you know what I miss most?

1518
01:25:55.688 --> 01:25:57.623
When Dad would
come back from a trip


1519
01:25:57.723 --> 01:25:59.291
and he would give me a high-five

1520
01:25:59.391 --> 01:26:02.260
for getting an A in social
studies or something.


1521
01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.063
Up top for some props.

1522
01:26:05.163 --> 01:26:07.600
I miss those. You know?

1523
01:26:08.601 --> 01:26:09.902
Yeah.

1524
01:26:10.002 --> 01:26:12.304
Well, I can give
you a high-five!


1525
01:26:12.404 --> 01:26:13.538
No, Mom.

1526
01:26:14.372 --> 01:26:16.108
You got a job,
you get a high-five.


1527
01:26:19.044 --> 01:26:20.979
Down low,

1528
01:26:21.079 --> 01:26:22.748
for both of us.

1529
01:26:30.155 --> 01:26:32.658
Keep going, keep going.
Come on, back, Mom!


1530
01:26:32.758 --> 01:26:34.693
Come on, come on.
Oh, stop, stop, stop!


1531
01:26:34.793 --> 01:26:35.794
Oh!

1532
01:26:37.763 --> 01:26:38.831
I can't believe it.

1533
01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:41.900
She wasn't paying
attention again.


1534
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.803
Oh! Look what you did.

1535
01:26:44.903 --> 01:26:46.338
You smashed up the RV.

1536
01:26:46.438 --> 01:26:48.040
What, I did? You were driving.
Oh, my.


1537
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.108
You were supposed to be
looking out for me.


1538
01:26:50.208 --> 01:26:51.777
Who cares?
We have insurance.


1539
01:26:51.877 --> 01:26:54.913
Lazydays has insurance.
It's their RV.


1540
01:26:55.013 --> 01:26:58.316
They trusted me with
this very expensive beast


1541
01:26:58.416 --> 01:27:00.085
and now we've busted it!

1542
01:27:00.185 --> 01:27:02.087
Mom! Kelley!

1543
01:27:02.187 --> 01:27:04.432
You know what, the problem is you
don't care about other people's things.


1544
01:27:04.456 --> 01:27:05.958
You only care about yourself.

1545
01:27:06.058 --> 01:27:07.993
Me, me, me.

1546
01:27:08.093 --> 01:27:10.095
And all you care about is Zach!

1547
01:27:10.195 --> 01:27:11.964
You and everybody else.

1548
01:27:12.064 --> 01:27:14.199
Oh, you are going
down this road again.


1549
01:27:14.299 --> 01:27:16.835
Nobody takes my photo.

1550
01:27:16.935 --> 01:27:19.204
You know, they can't
even spell my name right.


1551
01:27:19.304 --> 01:27:21.006
I do all the scut work.

1552
01:27:21.106 --> 01:27:23.151
I wake up at the ass-crack of
dawn and work my tail off...


1553
01:27:23.175 --> 01:27:25.077
Watch your language.
All day!


1554
01:27:25.177 --> 01:27:27.746
And all I get is yelled at!

1555
01:27:27.846 --> 01:27:28.914
Well, you know what?

1556
01:27:29.014 --> 01:27:31.016
Not anymore.
I'm out of here!


1557
01:27:31.116 --> 01:27:32.851
Go ahead and quit.

1558
01:27:32.951 --> 01:27:34.887
Just like you quit
everything else you ever did!


1559
01:27:34.987 --> 01:27:36.288
Everything you made me do!

1560
01:27:36.388 --> 01:27:38.623
Of course, I made you do it.

1561
01:27:38.724 --> 01:27:40.392
Mom, make her come back.

1562
01:27:40.492 --> 01:27:44.196
All right, Kelley, get... Just get
back here, we need to finish this.


1563
01:27:44.296 --> 01:27:45.363
You know what?

1564
01:27:45.463 --> 01:27:47.099
You get yourself a maid.

1565
01:27:47.199 --> 01:27:48.233
I'm gonna go get her.

1566
01:27:48.333 --> 01:27:50.135
Zach! No. No.

1567
01:27:50.936 --> 01:27:52.304
No, no, no.

1568
01:27:52.404 --> 01:27:54.239
I'll deal with her.

1569
01:27:54.339 --> 01:27:57.810
Can you just manage by
yourself for a minute, please?


1570
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:59.144
Okay?

1571
01:27:59.244 --> 01:28:00.813
Go inside,

1572
01:28:00.913 --> 01:28:04.016
lock the door behind you, okay?

1573
01:28:04.116 --> 01:28:05.818
I'll be right back.

1574
01:28:05.918 --> 01:28:06.952
With Kelley.

1575
01:28:09.755 --> 01:28:10.889
Lock it.

1576
01:28:29.742 --> 01:28:32.845
It's dangerous for a young
girl to be out on the road.


1577
01:28:32.945 --> 01:28:34.880
At night, alone.

1578
01:28:36.148 --> 01:28:37.215
But you know that.

1579
01:28:37.315 --> 01:28:38.717
I know a lot of things.

1580
01:28:38.817 --> 01:28:40.497
Not that you've ever
given me credit for...


1581
01:28:40.552 --> 01:28:42.263
But you don't know everything.
And neither do you.


1582
01:28:42.287 --> 01:28:45.057
Well, I know... And I'll
be the first to admit it.


1583
01:28:45.157 --> 01:28:46.458
Look, I apologize.

1584
01:28:46.558 --> 01:28:47.960
I'm just tired, we're all tired.

1585
01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.694
Come back.
No.


1586
01:28:55.901 --> 01:28:57.002
Hey!

1587
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:07.379
Where're you gonna go?

1588
01:29:07.479 --> 01:29:09.447
Ian's been calling me,
trying to get back.


1589
01:29:09.547 --> 01:29:12.150
I know you don't like him.

1590
01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:16.955
Like I said, I don't know
everything but I do know this...


1591
01:29:17.055 --> 01:29:20.358
The wrong man
can ruin everything.


1592
01:29:20.458 --> 01:29:22.961
Not every man, just some.

1593
01:29:23.061 --> 01:29:25.463
Are you really gonna
start with this again?


1594
01:29:25.563 --> 01:29:26.765
Kelley.

1595
01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:31.469
I understand
what you're going through.


1596
01:29:31.569 --> 01:29:34.506
I was young and in love once.

1597
01:29:34.606 --> 01:29:37.009
I loved and then I lost.

1598
01:29:38.143 --> 01:29:39.845
And I loved again,

1599
01:29:39.945 --> 01:29:41.947
and lost again.

1600
01:29:42.047 --> 01:29:45.417
And somewhere between
the hurt and the hollow...


1601
01:29:46.584 --> 01:29:48.821
Well,

1602
01:29:48.921 --> 01:29:51.790
I just figured
I wasn't much good at that.


1603
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:54.426
So, I gave it up.

1604
01:29:54.526 --> 01:29:56.094
I put everything I have,

1605
01:29:56.194 --> 01:29:58.931
my heart and my soul
into my children.


1606
01:30:01.133 --> 01:30:03.401
Family is everything to me.

1607
01:30:05.303 --> 01:30:07.039
You know that.

1608
01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:10.775
I'm asking you to come back.

1609
01:30:11.309 --> 01:30:13.245
Please.

1610
01:30:13.345 --> 01:30:15.480
I can't do that.

1611
01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:16.915
Why?

1612
01:30:18.984 --> 01:30:21.486
You treat Zach better than me.

1613
01:30:23.055 --> 01:30:24.422
Admit it.

1614
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:32.464
Yes, I do.

1615
01:30:32.998 --> 01:30:34.432
See!

1616
01:30:34.532 --> 01:30:36.468
But do you know why?

1617
01:30:36.568 --> 01:30:39.004
Because you love him more
than me, you always have.


1618
01:30:39.104 --> 01:30:41.406
That's where you're wrong, Kel.

1619
01:30:41.506 --> 01:30:44.542
I treat him better
because I learned how.


1620
01:30:44.642 --> 01:30:46.511
And I learned it
messing up with you.


1621
01:30:46.611 --> 01:30:49.381
I admit it.
I messed up.


1622
01:30:49.481 --> 01:30:51.383
It was on the job training

1623
01:30:51.483 --> 01:30:53.585
and I didn't know what I
was doing half the time.


1624
01:30:53.685 --> 01:30:56.021
I still mess up with Zach.

1625
01:30:56.121 --> 01:30:58.390
Sometimes I feel like
I'm just barely hanging on...


1626
01:30:58.490 --> 01:31:01.493
I don't know
what you want from me.


1627
01:31:03.228 --> 01:31:05.463
I'm sorry.

1628
01:31:05.563 --> 01:31:08.833
I know that's not enough.

1629
01:31:08.934 --> 01:31:10.435
It breaks my heart
to see you in pain,


1630
01:31:10.535 --> 01:31:14.406
and knowing that I am the cause
of it makes it even worse.


1631
01:31:16.208 --> 01:31:17.976
Please, hear me.

1632
01:31:23.248 --> 01:31:24.849
I'm sorry.

1633
01:31:26.484 --> 01:31:28.086
It's...

1634
01:31:29.454 --> 01:31:31.356
It's too late.

1635
01:31:33.491 --> 01:31:35.093
It is?

1636
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:46.371
Um...

1637
01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:49.507
Well...

1638
01:31:49.607 --> 01:31:51.276
Then I guess you better
take the van.


1639
01:31:51.376 --> 01:31:53.011
I don't want you hitching.

1640
01:31:53.111 --> 01:31:55.313
But what about you and Zach?

1641
01:31:55.413 --> 01:31:57.482
Um, we have the RV.

1642
01:31:58.716 --> 01:32:00.485
And tomorrow?

1643
01:32:02.254 --> 01:32:04.189
Um, we'll manage.

1644
01:32:08.126 --> 01:32:09.161
Mom.

1645
01:32:13.231 --> 01:32:17.902
Did you ever think about doing
something just for yourself?


1646
01:32:18.003 --> 01:32:20.672
Cut me and Zach
a little bit of slack?


1647
01:32:26.044 --> 01:32:28.646
But I'm very happy
with you kids.


1648
01:32:31.016 --> 01:32:33.418
All I've ever wanted
was a family.


1649
01:32:56.574 --> 01:32:58.210
You be safe.

1650
01:33:58.403 --> 01:34:00.638
Zach, come here.

1651
01:34:02.474 --> 01:34:04.309
Come here, darling.

1652
01:34:15.553 --> 01:34:17.655
I never told you this.

1653
01:34:19.557 --> 01:34:22.327
But when you were
just a baby and...


1654
01:34:23.661 --> 01:34:26.298
I was first a mom
with you kids...


1655
01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.034
We, uh...

1656
01:34:31.803 --> 01:34:34.038
We were in bad shape.

1657
01:34:35.173 --> 01:34:38.143
I was in bad shape.

1658
01:34:38.243 --> 01:34:41.779
We didn't wind up
homeless, but, um...


1659
01:34:41.879 --> 01:34:45.350
We came real, real close.

1660
01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:49.121
I was as frightened as
I've ever been in my life.


1661
01:34:50.255 --> 01:34:52.157
I was scared to death.

1662
01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:56.661
And I look at those moms
and their kids,


1663
01:34:57.629 --> 01:35:00.365
and I know that
could have been us.


1664
01:35:02.767 --> 01:35:05.170
What you're doing here,

1665
01:35:06.671 --> 01:35:09.707
it touches me, Zach.

1666
01:35:09.807 --> 01:35:12.710
In ways I can't even explain.

1667
01:35:16.748 --> 01:35:20.185
I am so proud of you.

1668
01:35:20.285 --> 01:35:23.388
And I'm so glad I get
to help you with this.


1669
01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:31.229
So, let's you and me
finish this, okay?


1670
01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:34.098
Let's go help those kids

1671
01:35:34.199 --> 01:35:36.868
and then we'll go home,
we'll fix our own problems.


1672
01:35:36.968 --> 01:35:38.370
All right?

1673
01:35:40.772 --> 01:35:42.740
Come on, buck up.

1674
01:35:43.875 --> 01:35:45.310
Tomorrow's the big day.

1675
01:35:45.410 --> 01:35:48.380
Think about all you've
accomplished here.


1676
01:35:50.748 --> 01:35:52.750
You did it, Zach.

1677
01:35:54.519 --> 01:35:56.188
You did it.

1678
01:37:43.461 --> 01:37:44.729
Mom.

1679
01:37:50.468 --> 01:37:51.869
I see her.

1680
01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:04.682
I'm glad you came back.

1681
01:38:04.782 --> 01:38:07.018
Took our first step together.

1682
01:38:11.489 --> 01:38:14.459
We're gonna take
our last step together.


1683
01:40:17.181 --> 01:40:19.951
♫ Close your eyes

1684
01:40:22.987 --> 01:40:26.390
♫ Remember when

1685
01:40:26.491 --> 01:40:29.026

01:40:33.498 --> 01:40:38.436

1694

♫ And all these children
they belong to you and I


1701

♫ They're yellow and brown

1706
