00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.410
<i>In this land,</i>

2
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.930
<i>family is everything.</i>

3
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.370
<i>It's the bonds
within the pride,</i>


4
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.090
<i>the pack,</i>

5
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.970
<i>and the herd...</i>

6
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.050
<i>...that allow each member to succeed.</i>

7
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.010
<i>Nowhere are these bonds
tested more fiercely</i>


8
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.290
<i>than in the great Kalahari Desert.</i>

9
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.890
<i>Here families are shaped</i>

10
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.370
<i>by courageous mothers...</i>

11
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.010
<i>wise elders...</i>

12
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.890
<i>...and tenacious underdogs.</i>

13
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.330
<i>All drawn to the immense oasis
that lies at the desert's very heart.</i>


14
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.810
<i>The Okavango Delta.</i>

15
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.810
<i>Home to more wildlife
than any other wetland on Earth...</i>


16
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.330
<i>it is seeing
some of the most extreme seasonal change</i>


17
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.850
<i>on the planet.</i>

18
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.010
<i>Through the chaos
and hardship of the coming year...</i>


19
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.890
<i>fates will entwine,</i>

20
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.690
<i>and incredible relationships
will be forged.</i>


21
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.250
<i>Not just within families
but between families.</i>


22
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.730
<i>And even with the land itself.</i>

23
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.170
<i>For a two-year-old lioness,</i>

24
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.530
<i>the strength of family
comes from her pride.</i>


25
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.250
<i>She and her sisterhood
control this territory...</i>


26
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.370
<i>...and their lead male
reigns as warrior king.</i>


27
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.850
<i>But in the Delta, change can come suddenly</i>

28
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.170
<i>and upend a family's peaceful existence.</i>

29
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.330
<i>The chink in her pride's armor
is the king himself.</i>


30
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.370
<i>Years of fighting
to defend his family and territory</i>


31
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.930
<i>have taken their toll.</i>

32
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.650
<i>His weakness puts the lioness at risk.</i>

33
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.050
<i>And presents an opportunity</i>

34
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.730
<i>for two ambitious young males.</i>

35
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.890
<i>The old warrior
marks his territory.</i>


36
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.690
<i>But he's frail.</i>

37
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.050
<i>And outnumbered.</i>

38
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.970
<i>Every year in the Okavango
is a new and dangerous journey,</i>


39
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.730
<i>but for the lioness,</i>

40
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.330
<i>this year will be
the most uncertain she's ever faced.</i>


41
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.490
<i>Every family confronts
the challenges of the Delta</i>


42
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.690
<i>in its own way.</i>

43
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.330
<i>A pack of
painted wolves, 24 strong.</i>


44
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.170
<i>Their strength,
a testament to their great leader,</i>


45
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.330
<i>the alpha female.</i>

46
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.930
<i>She's trained them
to think and hunt as one.</i>


47
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.370
<i>And to provide for all.</i>

48
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.690
<i>But the alpha is pregnant.</i>

49
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.170
<i>Her team will lose their leader,</i>

50
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.530
<i>just as the Delta
faces its greatest upheaval.</i>


51
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.330
<i>It's May.</i>

52
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.690
<i>And the surrounding Kalahari Desert
is facing the worst drought in decades.</i>


53
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.570
<i>Thousands of animals
are fleeing the parched outer regions...</i>


54
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.090
<i>traveling for weeks.</i>

55
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.290
<i>All drawn here for one reason.</i>

56
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.570
<i>Water.</i>

57
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.410
<i>Rainwater that fell four months ago</i>

58
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.770
<i>in the Angolan Highlands to the north</i>

59
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.370
<i>has finally made its way down,</i>

60
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.690
<i>across the Kalahari
and into the flatlands of the Delta.</i>


61
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.490
<i>Over nine trillion liters
of fresh water</i>


62
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.010
<i>floods the vast desert...</i>

63
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.770
<i>creating</i>

64
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.050
<i>the greatest oasis on the planet.</i>

65
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.850
<i>In the flood's wake
come the great herds...</i>


66
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.810
<i>joining those who live here year-round.</i>

67
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.250
<i>Everyone has a role to play</i>

68
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.410
<i>in shaping and maintaining this land.</i>

69
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.930
<i>Even a six-month-old elephant</i>

70
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.130
<i>on her first visit.</i>

71
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.970
<i>She's never seen so much water...</i>

72
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.290
<i>...and food.</i>

73
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.930
<i>With endless floodplains
to munch their way through,</i>


74
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.090
<i>elephants become
the natural gardeners of the Delta...</i>


75
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.410
<i>uprooting far more than they can eat.</i>

76
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.890
<i>But over-pruning can clog the waterways,</i>

77
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.050
<i>halting the water's spread.</i>

78
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.370
<i>What the gardeners have blocked up,</i>

79
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.970
<i>families of hippos bulldoze through.</i>

80
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.490
<i>Not being swimmers,
they tiptoe along the bottom.</i>


81
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.570
<i>And in their wake,
leave hippo-sized highways...</i>


82
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.490
<i>that connect rivers to pools
and pools to floodplains...</i>


83
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.330
<i>allowing the water to keep flowing,</i>

84
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.810
<i>feeding the vibrant growth
of the entire Delta.</i>


85
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.250
<i>But the flood
isn't good news for all.</i>


86
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.330
<i>For the lioness,</i>

87
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.450
<i>it means a loss of hunting grounds.</i>

88
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.890
<i>And the old warrior king
is nowhere to be seen.</i>


89
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.450
<i>Whether he fled or was killed,</i>

90
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.050
<i>the young invaders
have usurped his throne.</i>


91
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.250
<i>Only lionesses of breeding age
are allowed to stay now.</i>


92
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.690
<i>And she's not one of them.</i>

93
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.450
<i>To these new males,
she's just an extra mouth to feed,</i>


94
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:28.130
<i>with little to contribute.</i>

95
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.770
<i>Banished and alone,</i>

96
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.490
<i>she'll need all her skill
just to stay alive.</i>


97
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.530
<i>The alpha female
has been housebound for weeks.</i>


98
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.370
<i>Because...</i>

99
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.050
<i>Well, who would leave this scruffy bunch?</i>

100
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:46.330
<i>At four weeks old,
her pups venture out for the first time.</i>


101
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.050
<i>All 14 of them.</i>

102
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.730
<i>Unable to hunt for herself,
she must rely on her pack</i>


103
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.690
<i>to bring the meat she needs
to keep her milk flowing.</i>


104
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.490
<i>But her stay-at-home work
is nonstop.</i>


105
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.290
<i>Sweeping out the den...</i>

106
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.970
<i>three weeks' worth of ticks and fleas...</i>

107
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.370
<i>landing right back where they started.</i>

108
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.450
<i>Her pack is on patrol...</i>

109
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.370
<i>without their leader.</i>

110
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.010
<i>And the floodwaters are slowing them down.</i>

111
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.130
<i>Lechwe.</i>

112
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.530
<i>Just one would feed the entire pack.</i>

113
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.890
<i>With splayed hooves
and powerful legs,</i>


114
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.690
<i>they can drive on through the flood.</i>

115
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.010
<i>Without the guidance of the alpha,</i>

116
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.010
<i>the pack follow them
into the deeper water.</i>


117
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.050
<i>It's futile.</i>

118
00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.290
<i>And then...</i>

119
00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.650
<i>a lone impala.</i>

120
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:29.170
<i>He lacks the paddle-like hooves
and long legs of the lechwe.</i>


121
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:21.370
<i>They finish the job quickly
to avoid a clash with competitors.</i>


122
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.930
<i>The pack often take out
the weak or injured in a group,</i>


123
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.370
<i>easier prey,</i>

124
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.810
<i>with the added benefit
of reducing disease in herds.</i>


125
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.090
<i>The hunters deliver their meals
in the safest way possible.</i>


126
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.290
<i>In their stomachs.</i>

127
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.210
<i>Until the pups can hunt themselves,</i>

128
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.890
<i>they eat first.</i>

129
00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.650
<i>Generosity is
a core principle of their pack.</i>


130
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.250
<i>Though learning to share
doesn't come easily.</i>


131
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.530
<i>Retiring to the den
with your very first piece of meat</i>


132
00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.690
<i>is about as good as it gets.</i>

133
00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.010
<i>With water levels
at their highest,</i>


134
00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.370
<i>the Okavango becomes a true paradise.</i>

135
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.810
<i>Aquatic life
from the surrounding rivers and swamps</i>


136
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.650
<i>spreads into the grassland to spawn.</i>

137
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.890
<i>Branches and trees
knocked down by elephants</i>


138
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.130
<i>create protected nurseries for young fish.</i>

139
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.690
<i>During peak flood,</i>

140
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.970
<i>the Delta swells
to twice its original size,</i>


141
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.410
<i>and anywhere high and dry
becomes prime real estate.</i>


142
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.330
<i>Water fig trees provide perfect nesting</i>

143
00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:51.730
<i>for an astonishing variety
of fish-eating birds.</i>


144
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.330
<i>For these families,
it's not so much about where you build.</i>


145
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.290
<i>It's what you build.</i>

146
00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.010
<i>Only the finest
construction materials will do.</i>


147
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:45.690
<i>If you can't find
the exact fabric you're looking for...</i>


148
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.130
<i>just steal it from your neighbor.</i>

149
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.770
<i>They can always steal it back again.</i>

150
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.210
<i>Finally,</i>

151
00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:21.050
<i>a nest ready to hold
their most treasured possessions.</i>


152
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.290
<i>Gently turned...</i>

153
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:32.290
<i>and shaded from the scalding sun.</i>

154
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.090
<i>Eggshell? Snail shell?</i>

155
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.770
<i>He's a first-time dad.</i>

156
00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.090
<i>Everyone is in a
race to raise their young</i>

157
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.050
<i>before the floodwaters recede...</i>

158
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.690
<i>and the nests lose
their island protection.</i>


159
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.130
<i>The lioness has been
struggling to make a kill.</i>


160
00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:47.050
<i>In drier conditions,
a reedbuck or lechwe would be a good bet.</i>


161
00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.890
<i>But not in the flood,</i>

162
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.730
<i>not by herself.</i>

163
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.170
<i>And she's got competition.</i>

164
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.730
<i>Time to push back on her rivals.</i>

165
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.810
<i>It's pure intimidation.</i>

166
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.930
<i>She won't eat the carcass.</i>

167
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.490
<i>The pack would be wise
not to test her patience again.</i>


168
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.850
<i>By September,
the temperatures rise,</i>


169
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.930
<i>and water levels begin to drop,</i>

170
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.810
<i>leaving shrinking pools crowded with fish.</i>

171
00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:16.450
<i>Perfect timing.</i>

172
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.090
<i>The adults get to work...</i>

173
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.930
<i>feeding their precious little monsters.</i>

174
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.970
<i>New pools form each day
as the flood recedes.</i>


175
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.610
<i>Everyone has their own
special technique</i>


176
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.890
<i>to go with their own special bill.</i>

177
00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.290
<i>Pelicans favor the fishing net.</i>

178
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.010
<i>Pied kingfishers...</i>

179
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.770
<i>use the dive-bombing system.</i>

180
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.370
<i>Openbill storks
have snail-plucking down to a science.</i>


181
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:10.010
<i>And the rather theatrical black egret</i>

182
00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:14.170
<i>uses its cape to mimic shady spots
where fish like to hide.</i>


183
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:18.810
<i>Bravo.</i>

184
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.570
<i>Different approaches with one purpose.</i>

185
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.770
<i>To build up
their chicks' strength</i>


186
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.130
<i>as quickly as possible.</i>

187
00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.370
<i>Pelican chicks
are the greediest.</i>


188
00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:04.810
<i>They need up to 30 feeds a day.</i>

189
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.930
<i>The tireless adults all know</i>

190
00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.370
<i>the golden rule
of family life in the Delta.</i>


191
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:43.210
<i>The stronger your young,
the greater their chances of survival.</i>


192
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.010
<i>As the floodwaters recede</i>

193
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.090
<i>and the desert heat builds,</i>

194
00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.050
<i>hunting grounds dry out...</i>

195
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:18.330
<i>...shifting the balance of power
back to the predators.</i>


196
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:25.650
<i>But alone, the lioness' kill rate
is still dangerously low.</i>


197
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.210
<i>She's growing weaker
by the day.</i>


198
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.810
<i>To complicate matters,</i>

199
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:46.530
<i>she's come into season.</i>

200
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.930
<i>Her scent will carry
to any lions in the area.</i>


201
00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:00.250
<i>Including those she most wants to avoid.</i>

202
00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.490
<i>The young males
who destroyed her family.</i>


203
00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.250
<i>But with
the hunting grounds opening up,</i>


204
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:37.690
<i>another even bigger male
is drawn to the area.</i>


205
00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.570
<i>His dark mane and deep call</i>

206
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.010
<i>are signs he's in his prime.</i>

207
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:37.770
<i>It's risky.</i>

208
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.570
<i>But if they join forces,</i>

209
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:45.450
<i>he could offer protection
and hunting support.</i>


210
00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:58.250
<i>Her newfound alliance
is short-lived.</i>


211
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.290
<i>The stranger moves on
after only a few days.</i>


212
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.090
<i>Alone, once more,</i>

213
00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:12.970
<i>but this time pregnant.</i>

214
00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.290
<i>She won't be hunting
for just herself anymore.</i>


215
00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:45.930
<i>Every family in the Delta</i>

216
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:49.970
<i>is intimately connected
to the rhythms of the changing seasons.</i>


217
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.770
<i>The water levels are plummeting,</i>

218
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.170
<i>turning to mud.</i>

219
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.690
<i>Fun for a calf...</i>

220
00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.290
<i>...but it's a sign
her herd should move on.</i>

221
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.050
<i>With the dry season
taking grip,</i>


222
00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.610
<i>the herds need to make the most
of whatever grazing is left.</i>


223
00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.130
<i>She learns from watching.</i>

224
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.770
<i>But some things, she has yet to perfect.</i>

225
00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:01.530
<i>Such as paying attention,
so as not to get left behind.</i>


226
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.410
<i>She's being taken to a special place.</i>

227
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.810
<i>A stand of fan palms.</i>

228
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:34.010
<i>They thrive
where salts have been left behind</i>


229
00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:35.690
<i>by the evaporating flood.</i>

230
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.610
<i>And the fruits that sit at the top</i>

231
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.010
<i>are revered by elephants.</i>

232
00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.450
<i>Harvesting such lofty treats</i>

233
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:50.650
<i>is a trick
that only a four-ton bull can pull off.</i>


234
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:21.970
<i>Each shake
releases hundreds of fruits at once.</i>


235
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.850
<i>He knocks down
enough for everyone.</i>


236
00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.490
<i>This precious meal</i>

237
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:59.610
<i>is not just for this family
and not just for today.</i>


238
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.010
<i>Elephants are the chief distributors</i>

239
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.930
<i>of fan palm seeds.</i>

240
00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.850
<i>The calf's ancestors left this fruit.</i>

241
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:17.130
<i>And now
she will do the same for those to come.</i>


242
00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.690
<i>The herd will carry the seeds
for many miles.</i>


243
00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:32.210
<i>Wherever they release them
in their dung, they can take root.</i>


244
00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:36.530
<i>Just another
of the herd's vital contributions</i>


245
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:37.650
<i>to the Delta.</i>

246
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.330
<i>It will be
their last decent meal.</i>


247
00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:56.690
<i>From here on,</i>

248
00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:02.210
<i>the increasing scarcity of food and water
will drive their every move.</i>


249
00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:26.370
<i>The painted wolves
have made it through the flood,</i>


250
00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:28.850
<i>but not entirely intact.</i>

251
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.850
<i>One team member already killed,</i>

252
00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:37.690
<i>and now the best hunters
have deserted the alpha and her pups.</i>


253
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:43.730
<i>Too many new mouths to feed</i>

254
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.530
<i>and not enough food to go around.</i>

255
00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.130
<i>It's time for the rookies
to move out of the den</i>


256
00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:01.970
<i>and begin searching for food.</i>

257
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.890
<i>The pups'
first great adventure.</i>


258
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.570
<i>Their first patrol with the grown-ups.</i>

259
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.090
<i>Though, they are more
of a hindrance than a help.</i>


260
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:41.050
<i>Their little legs will carry them
up to 15 kilometers a day.</i>


261
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:58.650
<i>The alpha must rebuild her team
into a peak hunting machine...</i>


262
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.650
<i>and teach her pups
the ways of the pack hunter.</i>


263
00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:27.890
<i>The receding floodwaters</i>

264
00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:33.010
<i>have created perfect conditions
to unleash a plague.</i>


265
00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:37.410
<i>Locusts.</i>

266
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.050
<i>The building heat
triggers a mass hatching.</i>


267
00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:50.450
<i>Ten million greedy mouths
devour the drying vegetation.</i>


268
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:07.090
<i>Ancient termite mounds
seem to be the only things impervious</i>


269
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:10.610
<i>to the great forces
now at play in the Delta.</i>


270
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.130
<i>It's October.</i>

271
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.250
<i>In two short months,</i>

272
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.850
<i>the drought has transformed
a verdant paradise</i>


273
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:45.890
<i>into a barren dust bowl.</i>

274
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.890
<i>All the herds are searching for water</i>

275
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:57.610
<i>wherever they can find it.</i>

276
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.370
<i>They are easy pickings
for the two young males.</i>


277
00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:34.650
<i>Who grow bigger and stronger every day.</i>

278
00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:45.530
<i>They follow
the buffaloes' every move.</i>


279
00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:01.250
<i>Tracking the same herds,</i>

280
00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:04.890
<i>the lioness must stay
a safe distance from the males.</i>


281
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.290
<i>In her delicate state,
she desperately needs to eat.</i>


282
00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:23.210
<i>But taking on prey
the size of a buffalo all by herself</i>


283
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:25.490
<i>is next to impossible.</i>

284
00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:42.250
<i>At best, she can pick up
scraps left by the males,</i>


285
00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:47.450
<i>scavenging the bare minimum
she needs to stay alive.</i>


286
00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:16.330
<i>All the herds
and their predators</i>


287
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.530
<i>are being drawn in by the drought,</i>

288
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.450
<i>coming together in the heart of the Delta,</i>

289
00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:26.090
<i>where the last water sources remain.</i>

290
00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:32.050
<i>The calf and her herd</i>

291
00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:35.170
<i>have to travel further
with each passing day.</i>


292
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:50.530
<i>Their eyesight may be poor,
but with highly attuned hearing and smell,</i>


293
00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:54.410
<i>elephants can sense danger
from miles away.</i>


294
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:07.250
<i>Nile crocodiles.</i>

295
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:13.650
<i>Some up to six meters long,
weighing three-quarters of a ton.</i>


296
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:23.010
<i>But most are pretty small,
only a meter or so.</i>


297
00:48:52.810 --> 00:48:56.170
<i>The older elephants
show the calf how to get to the water</i>


298
00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:59.770
<i>by navigating
this strange obstacle course.</i>


299
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.090
<i>At last.</i>

300
00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.890
<i>And if you still haven't mastered
the art of the trunk,</i>


301
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:40.290
<i>face drinking is always a good fallback.</i>

302
00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:46.370
<i>The calf is learning...</i>

303
00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:50.370
<i>the hard way.</i>

304
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:59.930
<i>This water hole is the herd's savior.</i>

305
00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:10.530
<i>Elephants also use it
to protect their skin from the sun.</i>


306
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:22.690
<i>The mud cools
their overheated bodies as it evaporates.</i>


307
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:35.210
<i>And the dust settles
in the cracks and crevices of their skin,</i>


308
00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:36.690
<i>acting as sunblock.</i>

309
00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:55.010
<i>A spot like this is highly sought-after.</i>

310
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:11.250
<i>But the herd aren't ready
to move on from their mud spa just yet.</i>


311
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:33.970
<i>Such difficult times
teach the growing pups many things.</i>


312
00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:40.410
<i>Harassing a well-fed vulture
must be a good lesson in... something.</i>


313
00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:57.890
<i>A lone hyena...</i>

314
00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.650
<i>makes for a more serious education.</i>

315
00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:10.210
<i>Testing their stress levels
helps prepare them</i>


316
00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:14.090
<i>for future confrontations
with competitors.</i>


317
00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:29.250
<i>But they still need
to learn the most important lesson.</i>


318
00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:36.770
<i>The art...</i>

319
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.410
<i>of the hunt.</i>

320
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:10.850
<i>With the alpha
now back in charge...</i>


321
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:19.770
<i>she directs the team
to drive their prey into the thick mud</i>


322
00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:21.650
<i>to slow them down.</i>

323
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:38.930
<i>Her coaching is paying off.</i>

324
00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.890
<i>They're learning who to target...</i>

325
00:53:58.210 --> 00:53:59.930
<i>and who to leave.</i>

326
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:11.210
<i>The pack is growing
wiser and closer each day.</i>


327
00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:28.770
<i>By late October, temperatures
have soared to 45 degrees Celsius.</i>


328
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:32.730
<i>Not a drop has fallen.</i>

329
00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:38.210
<i>In recent years, the dry seasons here
have been getting longer,</i>


330
00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:41.010
<i>the heat more severe.</i>

331
00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:50.410
<i>This year is fast becoming
the drought of the century.</i>


332
00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:00.450
<i>Every day becomes a gamble</i>

333
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:04.210
<i>to find enough water
to keep the whole herd alive.</i>


334
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:14.490
<i>The calf and her mother
need it the most.</i>


335
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:24.210
<i>She's a prisoner in these lands</i>

336
00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:28.730
<i>that only a few months ago
offered her so much.</i>


337
00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:42.490
<i>Her survival
is entirely in the hands</i>


338
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:45.290
<i>of the wise, old leader.</i>

339
00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:47.570
<i>The herd's matriarch.</i>

340
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:57.810
<i>She's been traveling these pathways</i>

341
00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:00.050
<i>since she, too, was a young calf.</i>

342
00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:10.010
<i>Her brain, infused with memories,</i>

343
00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.010
<i>holds an ancient internal map</i>

344
00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:16.730
<i>of where the last pockets
of water might be found.</i>


345
00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:27.850
<i>Family is
more than just the herd.</i>


346
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:30.370
<i>Family is memory...</i>

347
00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:35.210
<i>and that's what's making the difference</i>

348
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:37.490
<i>between life and death.</i>

349
00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:44.730
<i>The old family knowledge
leads them</i>


350
00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:46.930
<i>to one of the last remaining water holes</i>

351
00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:48.650
<i>in the entire Delta.</i>

352
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.650
<i>Every muddy drop
is a lifesaver.</i>


353
00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:37.210
<i>But their little one
can't get to the water.</i>


354
00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:46.650
<i>So she simply gets
into the water.</i>


355
00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:58.450
<i>Getting out, not so easy.</i>

356
00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:39.410
<i>For a clumsy calf,
a loving family is her most powerful ally.</i>


357
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:03.770
<i>There's no time to waste.</i>

358
00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:05.610
<i>They need more water,</i>

359
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:09.290
<i>and they'll chase
the storm front to find it.</i>


360
00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:16.730
<i>Finally, clouds begin to form.</i>

361
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:19.730
<i>Giant storm cells.</i>

362
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:47.570
<i>Elephants are able to hear
the low frequencies of distant thunder</i>


363
00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:51.690
<i>and detect storms
up to 200 kilometers away.</i>


364
01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:18.970
<i>But in a region that's gone
seven months with barely a drop of rain,</i>


365
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.530
<i>the tinder-dry grasses are a ticking bomb.</i>

366
01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:33.890
<i>The adults in the herd
have seen fire before.</i>


367
01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:39.970
<i>Each year, up to 4,000 square kilometers
of the Delta burns.</i>


368
01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:47.410
<i>They know to stick close together
as they try to navigate the flames.</i>


369
01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:13.250
<i>The fires are devastating...</i>

370
01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:18.930
<i>...but don't devour everything.</i>

371
01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:35.330
<i>The grazers have thinned
the amount of fuel available to burn.</i>


372
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:40.610
<i>And the scorched areas
will create new pathways</i>


373
01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:42.930
<i>for next year's flood to access.</i>

374
01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:49.890
<i>The Delta has always
found a way to heal</i>

375
01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:54.090
<i>because its residents
never stop playing their part.</i>


376
01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.210
<i>At last, the skies yield.</i>

377
01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:14.450
<i>The greatest drought in living memory</i>

378
01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:17.010
<i>is finally broken.</i>

379
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:27.370
<i>Over the next five months,</i>

380
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:30.050
<i>half a meter of rain will fall here.</i>

381
01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:35.410
<i>Any ground scorched by the fire</i>

382
01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:37.410
<i>will be revitalized.</i>

383
01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:06.330
<i>The herds are released
from their water holes.</i>


384
01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:14.410
<i>And the predators spread out.</i>

385
01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:24.130
<i>Keeping the grazers
on the move,</i>


386
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:26.650
<i>giving the new shoots a chance,</i>

387
01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:30.810
<i>and preventing any one area
from becoming depleted.</i>


388
01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:38.130
<i>Balance...</i>

389
01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.890
<i>is maintained.</i>

390
01:03:55.890 --> 01:03:58.130
<i>And with the arrival
of the rains...</i>


391
01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:02.610
<i>come four new cubs.</i>

392
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.370
<i>The flush of green
has prompted a baby boom.</i>


393
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:42.530
<i>She moves her cubs
every few days...</i>


394
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:47.090
<i>to prevent their scent
from attracting enemies.</i>


395
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:14.130
<i>But her latest move
hasn't gone unnoticed.</i>


396
01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:24.370
<i>The young males
have picked up their trail.</i>


397
01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:46.330
<i>They will not tolerate
the presence of another male's┬ácubs.</i>


398
01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:04.890
<i>She's half their size
and outnumbered.</i>


399
01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:50.090
<i>They're trapped.</i>

400
01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:04.210
<i>Her instinct
is to lead her babies to safety.</i>


401
01:09:17.890 --> 01:09:21.490
<i>But the cubs have no idea
who they're up against.</i>


402
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:56.290
<i>She's lost track of a cub.</i>

403
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:37.850
<i>She'll fight
to the death for her family...</i>


404
01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:46.970
<i>...but the males won't risk further injury.</i>

405
01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:12.450
<i>Thanks to their
mother's bravery,</i>


406
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:14.930
<i>three of her cubs have survived.</i>

407
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.890
<i>She can't rest for long.</i>

408
01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:29.050
<i>She's all they've got.</i>

409
01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:55.450
<i>For the painted wolves,
life again is sweet.</i>


410
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:04.610
<i>Their mother has risen</i>

411
01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:07.610
<i>to the greatest challenge
she's ever faced.</i>


412
01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:12.770
<i>Bringing a pack cut to half its size</i>

413
01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:14.850
<i>through the perils of the drought</i>

414
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:18.770
<i>and transforming
a hapless bunch of rookies</i>


415
01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:22.330
<i>into a hardworking, successful team.</i>

416
01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:31.770
<i>Their comeback is complete.</i>

417
01:13:44.330 --> 01:13:45.810
<i>The gutsy little calf</i>

418
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:48.890
<i>has chalked up
her first year in the Delta...</i>


419
01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:54.810
<i>and she herself
has contributed to its upkeep...</i>


420
01:13:56.850 --> 01:13:59.010
<i>with every reed she's trampled,</i>

421
01:13:59.530 --> 01:14:01.770
<i>every palm seed she's left.</i>

422
01:14:03.170 --> 01:14:06.890
<i>If she can survive
another 30 or 40 more years</i>


423
01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:09.050
<i>of increasing extremes,</i>

424
01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:13.810
<i>fires, floods, and famines...</i>

425
01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:19.730
<i>...she will finally become a matriarch</i>

426
01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:23.330
<i>and pass on everything she's learned</i>

427
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.570
<i>to the next generation.</i>

428
01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:37.930
<i>Now, four months old,</i>

429
01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:41.010
<i>the lioness's cubs are getting stronger</i>

430
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:43.050
<i>and more able every day.</i>

431
01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:59.930
<i>Single-handedly,
she's kept them all well-fed.</i>


432
01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:24.210
<i>Their games are
practice for real life.</i>


433
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:27.290
<i>To teach them
how to catch prey like their mother.</i>


434
01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:55.930
<i>She once lost
what was most precious to her.</i>


435
01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:05.890
<i>But now,
has a little pride to call her own.</i>


436
01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:11.890
<i>Her cubs will soon learn
the vital importance of family.</i>


437
01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:19.610
<i>Just one of a myriad of families
whose presence sustains their land.</i>


438
01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:25.970
<i>These animals
will continue to adapt</i>


439
01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:28.210
<i>as best they can...</i>

440
01:16:32.690 --> 01:16:35.210
<i>to the growing threats they face.</i>

441
01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:38.250
<i>The world's climate changing...</i>

442
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:43.210
<i>becoming increasingly hostile,</i>

443
01:16:43.290 --> 01:16:44.690
<i>more extreme.</i>

444
01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:54.090
<i>Their greatest weapon
in their fight to survive is each other.</i>


445
01:16:55.730 --> 01:17:00.610
<i>For their fates are bound together
with this great wilderness.</i>


446
01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:04.890
<i>The magnificent,</i>

447
01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:07.130
<i>ever-changing</i>

448
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:10.130
<i>Okavango Delta.</i>
