1
00:02:40.655 --> 00:02:41.700
Ned Lewis.

2
00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:44.136
Who?

3
00:02:45.182 --> 00:02:46.531
My bank?

4
00:02:47.836 --> 00:02:50.012
A guy from my bank?

5
00:02:50.056 --> 00:02:52.624
My bank sent some guy over.

6
00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:55.366
God, I can't be that far overdrawn.

7
00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.064
All right. Yeah, tell
him I'll be right down.

8
00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.639
- Ned Lewis?
- Yeah.


9
00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:09.902
Lenny Brown. Can we talk in your office?

10
00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:12.470
So you're from
Manufacturer's Hanover Trust?


11
00:03:12.513 --> 00:03:13.993
No, where did you get that idea, Ned?

12
00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:15.734
I thought you told Johnny...

13
00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:17.726
I told Johnny I was from
Equity Appreciation Associates.


14
00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:20.478
Maybe he got the idea that was
a bank, but I'm no banker, Ned.


15
00:03:20.521 --> 00:03:24.177
I want to talk to you about saving
$250,000 on your income tax this year.


16
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:25.483
Is this a joke?

17
00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:26.919
Cattle feed is highly leveraged.

18
00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:29.008
The write-off this year is 4-to-1.

19
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.271
It's all been blue sky
and it's perfectly kosher.


20
00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:35.493
Look, I made $28,200 last
year. I'm just a working stiff.


21
00:03:35.536 --> 00:03:37.049
No, I was talking about the interest income

22
00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.529
from that money your father gave you.

23
00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:40.846
What money? My father
didn't give me any money.


24
00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.196
Your father is Edward
Lewis at Dreyfus, right?


25
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.067
Where'd you get an idea like that?

26
00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:47.244
My father's a professor at CUNY.

27
00:03:47.287 --> 00:03:49.236
This girl you went out with,
she works with my wife.


28
00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:51.422
- She mentioned you.
- What girl?


29
00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.501
She said your father was
some famous guy about money


30
00:03:53.511 --> 00:03:54.860
and I put two and two together.

31
00:03:54.903 --> 00:03:57.210
Teaches economics.
Hardly famous.


32
00:03:57.254 --> 00:04:00.082
You don't know anybody who could use

33
00:04:00.126 --> 00:04:02.389
a $250,000 tax shelter, do you?

34
00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:04.086
Not personally.

35
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.479
I'm such a schmuck.

36
00:04:05.523 --> 00:04:07.046
Sorry.
Wrong me, I guess.


37
00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.135
Thanks for not jerking me around, you know.

38
00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:10.876
I leave a piece of
my soul on the floor

39
00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.346
every time I do this song and dance.

40
00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:13.444
No problem.

41
00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:14.836
Go out like a battleship,

42
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.491
come back like a raft.
Thanks.


43
00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:20.277
You've really got a 4-to-1 write-off?

44
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.104
That's what they tell me.

45
00:04:22.148 --> 00:04:24.194
Hey...

46
00:04:24.237 --> 00:04:26.544
Can I buy you lunch
as my way of apologizing?


47
00:04:26.587 --> 00:04:27.980
No, that's okay, really.

48
00:04:28.023 --> 00:04:29.982
Please, I'd like the company.

49
00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:32.898
Yeah? Okay.

50
00:04:32.941 --> 00:04:34.639
It's just so funny.
I got the...


51
00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:36.380
I could never be in sales.

52
00:04:36.423 --> 00:04:38.730
It hurts your feelings too much
when you get turned down.


53
00:04:38.773 --> 00:04:40.635
Sometimes I get discouraged,
maybe even a little depressed,


54
00:04:40.645 --> 00:04:42.255
but you got to shrug it off.

55
00:04:42.299 --> 00:04:43.899
I could let it get to me,
go around fractured,


56
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.780
But thank God I got somebody at home.

57
00:04:45.824 --> 00:04:47.391
She won't ask,
"Did you make the sale?"


58
00:04:47.434 --> 00:04:49.958
She'll just give a hug and
a kiss and I'm whole again.


59
00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:51.133
Len, you're a lucky man.

60
00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:52.177
Ah, I know that.

61
00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:56.269
I keep reminding myself.
You got a wife or anything?


62
00:04:56.313 --> 00:04:58.010
No, nothing.

63
00:04:58.053 --> 00:04:59.751
You'd have to take second best anyhow.

64
00:04:59.794 --> 00:05:01.786
If you saw Linda and me, you
know, at a restaurant like this


65
00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:03.885
you'd say,
"There's a mismatch."


66
00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.713
I've seen it in people's eyes.

67
00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:08.499
"How did a guy like that get a
girl like her? He must be rich."


68
00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:11.241
Not that I'm not trying.

69
00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:12.894
You know, here's the funny part.

70
00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:14.940
Money doesn't mean a thing to Linda.

71
00:05:14.983 --> 00:05:17.062
It's nice to hear somebody
talk about his wife that way.


72
00:05:17.072 --> 00:05:19.717
You know, most of the guys I know,
they put their wives down all the time.


73
00:05:19.727 --> 00:05:20.815
Would you like to meet her?

74
00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:22.556
Yeah, sure.
Sometime.


75
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.211
You could come to dinner.
Here's my card.


76
00:05:27.344 --> 00:05:29.520
- So, what do you think? Tonight?
- Tonight?


77
00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:30.859
- Yeah, dinner at our place.
- You're sure?


78
00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:33.175
You don't want to check with your wife?

79
00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.777
I'll tell her I met a guy, invited him to
dinner. She'll say, "Great, no sweat."


80
00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:37.169
You'll wonder how a schmuck like me

81
00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:38.964
Wound up with a beauty like Linda.

82
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.967
Funny way to start a friendship,

83
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.838
me thinking you were someone else, huh?

84
00:05:43.882 --> 00:05:45.569
Well, back to the salt mines.
Got to catch a cab.


85
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:46.841
Thanks for lunch.

86
00:05:46.885 --> 00:05:47.581
Anytime.
See you tonight, okay?


87
00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.017
- Right.
- Bye-bye.


88
00:06:06.774 --> 00:06:08.254
Linda?

89
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.823
Linda, Ned is here.

90
00:06:17.263 --> 00:06:20.179
Welcome to CasaBrown.
Let me take your coat.


91
00:06:20.222 --> 00:06:22.094
Linda, Ned is here.

92
00:06:22.137 --> 00:06:23.835
It's still raining, huh?

93
00:06:23.878 --> 00:06:26.881
Linda?
Oh, Linda.


94
00:06:26.925 --> 00:06:28.482
This is Ned Lewis of the Financial Journal.

95
00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:29.580
Hello, Ned.

96
00:06:29.623 --> 00:06:31.103
Pleased to meet you.

97
00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:33.410
- Was I right or was I right?
- You were right.


98
00:06:33.453 --> 00:06:35.760
Is she, like, the most
beautiful girl you ever met?


99
00:06:35.803 --> 00:06:37.501
No question.

100
00:06:37.544 --> 00:06:39.503
He loves me.

101
00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:41.026
What do you do?

102
00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.071
I'm a paralegal at a corporate law firm.

103
00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:44.116
Sounds interesting.

104
00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.031
Dull as dishwater.

105
00:06:46.074 --> 00:06:47.902
Lenny's the talent in the family.

106
00:06:47.946 --> 00:06:50.296
She's being modest.
You should see her dance.


107
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.689
You dance?

108
00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:54.431
Does she dance?
She dances like a dream.


109
00:06:54.474 --> 00:06:56.945
I wanted to be a ballerina. I
guess most little girls do, but...


110
00:06:56.955 --> 00:06:58.086
No buts about it.

111
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.087
You'll have whatever you want.

112
00:06:59.131 --> 00:07:00.437
That's a promise.

113
00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:04.136
I'm happy just taking classes.

114
00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:06.747
Uh, I'm a little too old
to be a professional.


115
00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:09.671
Now, I bet you never heard a beautiful
girl admit to that, huh, Ned? Huh?


116
00:07:11.404 --> 00:07:13.885
So, how long have you been with Equity?

117
00:07:13.928 --> 00:07:16.888
Oh, Equity Appreciation Associates.

118
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:19.760
Well, I'm not really with them.

119
00:07:19.804 --> 00:07:22.850
I'm freelancing. I do PR work,
some favors here and there.


120
00:07:22.894 --> 00:07:25.234
The problem with EAA is they
won't give me any decent leads.


121
00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:27.444
That's how I wound up barking
up your tree this morning.


122
00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:29.988
Lenny told me about the mistake.

123
00:07:30.031 --> 00:07:32.120
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

124
00:07:32.164 --> 00:07:33.590
He was sort of counting on that sale...

125
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.341
- Honey.
- ...to break into the business.


126
00:07:35.385 --> 00:07:36.854
That thing doesn't mean anything to Ned.

127
00:07:36.864 --> 00:07:38.039
Does it?

128
00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:39.780
- What kind of thing?
- Hustling for money.


129
00:07:39.824 --> 00:07:41.468
You're above all that, writing
for a big paper and everything.


130
00:07:41.478 --> 00:07:43.697
I worry about money, Lenny,
just like everybody else.


131
00:07:43.741 --> 00:07:45.133
But you got some backstops.

132
00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:47.527
You start falling down that well...

133
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:50.138
You got some slats across
to catch yourself, all right?


134
00:07:50.182 --> 00:07:52.271
I saw a funny
thing on the bus today.

135
00:07:52.314 --> 00:07:54.142
A man got on with a French horn...

136
00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:55.666
You got your professor father.

137
00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.407
You got an education.

138
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.713
You got the Financial Journal.
You can't fall too far.


139
00:07:59.757 --> 00:08:03.108
The bus driver wanted the man with
the French horn to pay an extra fare


140
00:08:03.151 --> 00:08:05.066
because the French horn
took up so much room.


141
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.373
My old man's an ex-printer on disability.

142
00:08:07.417 --> 00:08:10.028
My mother is a secretary for the
Ladies Garment Workers Union.


143
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:11.943
So the man with the French horn,

144
00:08:11.986 --> 00:08:13.684
he said that he would play a concert

145
00:08:13.727 --> 00:08:15.555
for everybody instead, and he did...

146
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.557
I got a high school education!

147
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:19.994
...all the way
across 86th Street.


148
00:08:20.038 --> 00:08:21.735
It was beautiful.
I cried.


149
00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:31.005
I drank too much wine.

150
00:08:33.007 --> 00:08:35.488
You only had two glasses.

151
00:08:35.532 --> 00:08:36.881
You're just tired.

152
00:08:38.186 --> 00:08:39.884
Work too hard.

153
00:08:42.016 --> 00:08:43.061
Yeah.

154
00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:47.195
I'm a little tired, I guess.

155
00:08:48.545 --> 00:08:50.416
What do you think of Ned?

156
00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.070
He seems very nice.

157
00:08:54.638 --> 00:08:56.107
I wonder if we
could get a little blurb

158
00:08:56.117 --> 00:08:58.990
in the Journal about Manny's Pizza Parlor.

159
00:08:59.033 --> 00:09:01.819
You know, how he started.

160
00:09:01.862 --> 00:09:03.777
It's a great success story.

161
00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:05.866
Lenny, you can't ask him.

162
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.694
It's the Financial Journal.

163
00:09:07.738 --> 00:09:09.609
It'd be worth a grand.

164
00:09:15.049 --> 00:09:17.302
My heart falls in on itself
when you look at me like that.


165
00:09:17.312 --> 00:09:18.488
Lenny...

166
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.186
I love you.

167
00:09:21.229 --> 00:09:24.015
It hurts me to see you belittle yourself.

168
00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:27.234
I know.

169
00:09:28.715 --> 00:09:29.847
You're right.

170
00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:35.026
Sometimes I think I can't cut it.

171
00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:38.159
No matter how hard I try,
like, I'm in quicksand.


172
00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:39.944
And the more I struggle...

173
00:09:41.902 --> 00:09:43.425
The deeper I sink.

174
00:09:43.469 --> 00:09:44.905
It'll be all right.

175
00:09:47.734 --> 00:09:48.996
Don't ever leave me.

176
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.998
Silly, I'd never leave you.

177
00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:52.260
I know things look bleak.

178
00:09:52.304 --> 00:09:54.219
Things are not bleak, Lenny.

179
00:09:54.262 --> 00:09:57.222
I'm very happy.
Don't you know that?


180
00:09:59.441 --> 00:10:01.487
Just stick with me...

181
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:03.315
Please.

182
00:10:03.358 --> 00:10:04.925
Till I fall off the Earth.

183
00:10:08.668 --> 00:10:10.409
Come to bed.

184
00:10:10.452 --> 00:10:11.671
Make love to me.

185
00:10:23.944 --> 00:10:25.293
Good morning.
Hallis-Richardson.


186
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:29.384
May I say who's calling?

187
00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:30.472
One moment, please.

188
00:10:32.518 --> 00:10:34.085
Mr. Rogers on 7.

189
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:37.088
Good morning.
Hallis-Richardson.


190
00:10:37.131 --> 00:10:38.176
Shit.

191
00:10:38.219 --> 00:10:39.264
Please hold.

192
00:10:40.961 --> 00:10:42.267
Reception.

193
00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:44.791
Yes, Mr. Hallis.

194
00:10:48.403 --> 00:10:50.318
They're ready for you,
Mr. Brown.


195
00:10:50.362 --> 00:10:51.581
Thank you.

196
00:10:55.628 --> 00:10:58.544
- Ah. Mr. Brown.
- Call me Lenny.


197
00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.232
Gentlemen, Mr. 
Brown has applied to be

198
00:11:01.242 --> 00:11:04.637
our sales rep on the Connecticut project.

199
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:07.379
Tell us a little bit
about yourself, Mr. Brown.


200
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.341
Gentlemen, I won't bore you
with the reading of my resume,


201
00:11:13.385 --> 00:11:15.387
some of which is even true.

202
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.215
I assume you all know how to read.

203
00:11:17.258 --> 00:11:19.478
Besides, we're born again
with each new project.


204
00:11:19.521 --> 00:11:22.394
And all your past successes and
dean's list semesters don't cut much ice


205
00:11:22.437 --> 00:11:23.646
when it comes to the big question:

206
00:11:23.656 --> 00:11:25.005
will it sell?

207
00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:27.355
Then tell us, Mr. Brown.
Will it sell?


208
00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:29.270
Sure, oh, yeah, it'll sell.

209
00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:31.359
Over the life of the partnership,

210
00:11:31.403 --> 00:11:34.624
I guess everyone will enjoy
some small tax benefits,


211
00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:37.975
realize a nice, safe, though
modest return on their investment.


212
00:11:38.018 --> 00:11:39.454
You don't need me for that.

213
00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:41.152
But will it soar?

214
00:11:41.195 --> 00:11:42.806
That's another question.

215
00:11:42.849 --> 00:11:44.808
And I'm afraid the answer is no.

216
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:46.843
When your aunt Peggy and
the cousins get off the train,


217
00:11:46.853 --> 00:11:48.986
you're not gonna rush
them over to this mall,


218
00:11:49.029 --> 00:11:52.163
Because you don't really identify
with it. Sure, it's quaint, I guess.


219
00:11:52.206 --> 00:11:53.643
But it's also boring.

220
00:11:53.686 --> 00:11:56.254
People struggle against
smallness all their lives.


221
00:11:56.297 --> 00:11:59.387
Let them identify with something big.

222
00:11:59.431 --> 00:12:02.782
You got a duplex theater here.
Show "A" or show "B." That's it.


223
00:12:02.826 --> 00:12:05.655
There's a place in Toronto
that has 17 screens.


224
00:12:05.698 --> 00:12:06.820
There's another one in Beverly Hills...

225
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.658
Connecticut is not in Beverly Hills.

226
00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:11.661
Everybody wants a taste of
Beverly Hills, even in Connecticut.


227
00:12:11.704 --> 00:12:14.446
Especially in Connecticut, believe me.

228
00:12:14.489 --> 00:12:16.056
You want people coming to your mall,

229
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.797
not just because they can buy things here

230
00:12:17.841 --> 00:12:19.136
that you get cheaper somewhere else.

231
00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:22.323
You want them to have an experience.

232
00:12:24.935 --> 00:12:26.458
You know what I mean.

233
00:12:30.114 --> 00:12:31.463
You didn't stand a chance, kid.

234
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.599
Thanks.
Excuse me for breathing.


235
00:12:37.643 --> 00:12:39.732
Nothing personal.

236
00:12:39.776 --> 00:12:42.256
You had vision, talked a
kind of poetry. It scared them.


237
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.085
These guys wear suspenders and belts.

238
00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:46.903
I should've told them
what they wanted to hear,


239
00:12:46.913 --> 00:12:49.046
Give less than I got,

240
00:12:49.089 --> 00:12:51.831
but I can't give less than
I got. I don't know how.


241
00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:54.616
My name is Max Sherman.
Let me buy you a drink.


242
00:12:58.142 --> 00:12:59.491
Thank you.

243
00:12:59.534 --> 00:13:00.579
Cheers.

244
00:13:03.756 --> 00:13:05.802
Got family?

245
00:13:05.845 --> 00:13:07.325
Uh, a wife.

246
00:13:07.368 --> 00:13:08.882
We haven't had time to have children yet.

247
00:13:08.892 --> 00:13:10.371
Yeah, me neither.

248
00:13:12.373 --> 00:13:14.027
So, where are you from?

249
00:13:14.071 --> 00:13:17.944
I got a couple things out
here, some stuff in Texas.


250
00:13:17.988 --> 00:13:20.512
My major operation is
California, Southern California.


251
00:13:20.555 --> 00:13:21.948
You live out there?

252
00:13:21.992 --> 00:13:23.471
I live where the money is.

253
00:13:25.865 --> 00:13:27.649
You don't think this New York crowd

254
00:13:27.693 --> 00:13:29.869
would have anything to do with me

255
00:13:29.913 --> 00:13:31.731
unless I could move millions
of bucks around, do you?


256
00:13:31.741 --> 00:13:32.698
Your wife work?

257
00:13:32.742 --> 00:13:34.526
Yeah, she has a great job.

258
00:13:34.569 --> 00:13:35.919
Yeah, lucky for you, huh?

259
00:13:35.962 --> 00:13:37.616
I do all right.

260
00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:39.749
Everything I do is just
a lot chancier, that's all.


261
00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:41.272
Yeah, you just probably haven't found

262
00:13:41.315 --> 00:13:43.535
the right products yet,
the right territory.


263
00:13:43.578 --> 00:13:45.276
Got any suggestions?

264
00:13:45.319 --> 00:13:47.931
LA, Southern California.

265
00:13:47.974 --> 00:13:49.976
Real estate that won't ever go bad.

266
00:13:52.152 --> 00:13:54.546
Every year in LA,

267
00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:56.287
there's this whole crop of people

268
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.811
who never had money.

269
00:13:58.855 --> 00:14:02.554
And this year, they
made a ton of it.

270
00:14:02.597 --> 00:14:04.717
And then they find out that
the government wants half.


271
00:14:05.557 --> 00:14:07.777
"Whoa, what's this?"

272
00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:12.520
Yeah, that's where I come in.

273
00:14:12.564 --> 00:14:14.479
You got to know
a little about taxes and, uh,


274
00:14:14.522 --> 00:14:16.046
limited partnerships.

275
00:14:17.612 --> 00:14:19.614
But most of all,

276
00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:21.747
you got to know how to sell.

277
00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:24.228
You're describing me,
Mr. Sherman.


278
00:14:24.271 --> 00:14:27.405
Well, did you ever take a vow
to stay in New York?


279
00:14:27.448 --> 00:14:29.233
Los Angeles is a great place.

280
00:14:29.276 --> 00:14:30.930
We don't have any friends in Los Angeles.

281
00:14:30.974 --> 00:14:32.802
We don't have any friends here.

282
00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:35.326
We have each other. We'll still
have each other, you and me.


283
00:14:35.369 --> 00:14:37.023
Linda, this is my big chance.

284
00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:38.546
What about my job?

285
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.244
You're not gonna work in LA.

286
00:14:40.287 --> 00:14:42.507
For a change, I'll be
supporting you. You can dance.


287
00:14:44.465 --> 00:14:46.772
No no, we should...
Maybe we're going too fast.


288
00:14:46.816 --> 00:14:48.992
We should just take this
a step at a time.

289
00:14:49.035 --> 00:14:52.169
The hell with that. You don't
step through life. "Teacher, may I?"


290
00:14:52.212 --> 00:14:54.867
It goes too quick for that.
You got to leap through life!


291
00:14:54.911 --> 00:14:57.174
What about our apartment and all our stuff?

292
00:14:57.217 --> 00:15:00.351
This dump? This junk? You
think I'll take this crap to LA?


293
00:15:00.394 --> 00:15:02.222
We'll get new furniture
that's right for LA!


294
00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:03.833
You think a successful man in LA

295
00:15:03.876 --> 00:15:05.781
asks his wife to park her
behind on junk like this?


296
00:15:05.791 --> 00:15:07.793
Forget about it!
Come and get it!


297
00:15:07.837 --> 00:15:10.361
- We're out of here!
- Are you crazy?


298
00:15:10.404 --> 00:15:12.711
Come on! Are you with me?
Let me see you leap!


299
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.815
Flight 701, Honolulu

300
00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:31.773
is now in final boarding.

301
00:15:31.817 --> 00:15:33.645
Lenny, look.

302
00:15:33.688 --> 00:15:36.300
All passengers please
proceed immediately to the gate.


303
00:15:36.343 --> 00:15:37.867
I'm Lenny Brown.

304
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.869
Yes, sir. Mr. Sherman
arranged for your car.


305
00:15:39.912 --> 00:15:41.044
May I carry your bags?

306
00:15:41.087 --> 00:15:42.262
Thank you.

307
00:15:43.655 --> 00:15:45.831
- Coat?
- Oh! Thank you.


308
00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:48.094
Come this way, please.
Just follow me. Excuse me.


309
00:15:48.138 --> 00:15:50.488
Mr. Martin,
Mr. Anthony Martin,


310
00:15:50.531 --> 00:15:53.665
please meet your party
at B-5, baggage claim area.


311
00:16:00.541 --> 00:16:01.847
Oh.

312
00:16:06.983 --> 00:16:08.723
Mr. Brown, would you
hit the "play" button


313
00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.073
on the cassette machine, please?

314
00:16:10.116 --> 00:16:11.117
Thank you.

315
00:16:13.641 --> 00:16:16.035
Welcome to LA.

316
00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:19.691
Sorry I couldn't pick you up myself,
kids, but business is business.


317
00:16:19.734 --> 00:16:22.694
I had my girl fix you up in a
little place in the Hollywood Hills.


318
00:16:22.737 --> 00:16:24.261
I think it'll be comfortable for you.

319
00:16:24.304 --> 00:16:26.916
She's laid in some food and vino,

320
00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:29.135
so you should celebrate
if you feel like it.


321
00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:31.877
Tomorrow, at 9:00
in the morning, we work.


322
00:16:31.921 --> 00:16:34.706
In the meantime,
unpack, relax, have a swim.


323
00:16:35.925 --> 00:16:37.665
"Have a swim"?

324
00:16:44.977 --> 00:16:45.977
There you are!

325
00:16:47.762 --> 00:16:50.896
You thought you were
gonna be next to an air shaft.


326
00:17:01.907 --> 00:17:03.909
I wonder what they're all doing tonight.

327
00:17:03.953 --> 00:17:05.128
Who?

328
00:17:05.171 --> 00:17:06.331
The poor people of the world.

329
00:17:07.434 --> 00:17:08.870
It's like a dream, isn't it?

330
00:17:08.914 --> 00:17:10.872
Want to wake up?

331
00:17:10.916 --> 00:17:12.744
No, never.

332
00:17:12.787 --> 00:17:14.964
Me neither.

333
00:17:15.007 --> 00:17:16.966
Last one to the other side loses.

334
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.368
If everything works out...

335
00:17:28.412 --> 00:17:29.717
Which it will.

336
00:17:29.761 --> 00:17:30.970
...there's only
one thing I want.


337
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.590
Anything.

338
00:17:32.633 --> 00:17:34.200
I want a baby.

339
00:17:34.244 --> 00:17:35.723
Take two, they're small.

340
00:17:35.767 --> 00:17:37.160
I mean it.

341
00:17:37.203 --> 00:17:39.771
Can we?
If everything works out?


342
00:17:39.814 --> 00:17:42.121
You would make such a terrific mother.

343
00:17:42.165 --> 00:17:44.994
Are you serious, really?
Would you want to?


344
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.760
We can go through the motions.

345
00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:09.192
She's a heartbreaker, kid.

346
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.673
Didn't I tell you?

347
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:13.761
Can you see her with me?

348
00:18:13.805 --> 00:18:14.980
My mother used to say,

349
00:18:15.024 --> 00:18:18.027
"There's a lid
for every pot."


350
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.854
Down to business.
Did you do your homework?


351
00:18:20.986 --> 00:18:22.205
I'm ready.

352
00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:26.165
This is it.

353
00:18:28.211 --> 00:18:29.971
The appreciation
on this particular building,


354
00:18:29.995 --> 00:18:31.866
because of the proximity to the harbor,

355
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.293
the good air quality and ample parking,

356
00:18:33.303 --> 00:18:35.914
is going to outstrip most
comparable properties.


357
00:18:35.957 --> 00:18:38.472
The write-off for the purchase of the
building and the conversion of the offices


358
00:18:38.482 --> 00:18:41.006
Should run 2-to-1 over
the seven-year investment.


359
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.052
We've had a ruling from the IRS

360
00:18:43.095 --> 00:18:44.478
classifying us a limited partnership,

361
00:18:44.488 --> 00:18:46.045
but for tax purposes,
and since most of your


362
00:18:46.055 --> 00:18:48.405
deductible losses will
count towards this tax year,


363
00:18:48.448 --> 00:18:50.494
it's really a question
of giving money to Uncle Sam


364
00:18:50.537 --> 00:18:52.235
or owning a percentage of prime property.

365
00:18:52.278 --> 00:18:54.106
What's the price per?

366
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.586
$20,000 a unit,
Dr. Shapiro.


367
00:18:55.629 --> 00:18:57.979
All right, Lenny, 
I'll take five units.

368
00:18:58.023 --> 00:19:00.286
You're in.
Dr. Bishop?


369
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.419
I'll talk it over with my wife.

370
00:19:02.462 --> 00:19:04.116
It's going to be a very popular offering.

371
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.629
We can't guarantee
there'll be any units left...


372
00:19:05.639 --> 00:19:07.554
All right, five.

373
00:19:07.598 --> 00:19:10.253
Great. By Friday, the partnership
should be fully invested.


374
00:19:10.296 --> 00:19:12.690
A 2-to-1 write-off this
early in the year as solid...


375
00:19:12.733 --> 00:19:14.605
Lenny, you already
sold it. Don't buy it back.


376
00:19:21.133 --> 00:19:23.092
Bonjour.
This way, please.


377
00:19:44.939 --> 00:19:46.115
Enjoy your lunch,
Mr. Sherman.


378
00:19:46.158 --> 00:19:47.681
- Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.


379
00:19:50.162 --> 00:19:51.337
Been here before?

380
00:19:53.557 --> 00:19:55.341
This is my table.

381
00:19:55.385 --> 00:19:58.649
Any guest comes with me,
he knows where I'll sit.


382
00:19:58.692 --> 00:20:01.304
Look around you.
A lot of tables, right?


383
00:20:01.347 --> 00:20:03.262
Wrong.

384
00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:05.308
Five tables.

385
00:20:05.351 --> 00:20:08.311
All the rest of the people
come here to eat.


386
00:20:08.354 --> 00:20:09.921
Food's pretty good.

387
00:20:11.531 --> 00:20:13.707
Those tables...

388
00:20:13.751 --> 00:20:15.970
Strictly for Michigan.

389
00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:17.711
The people probably read about the place

390
00:20:17.755 --> 00:20:18.755
from the hotel magazine.

391
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.412
These tables...

392
00:20:24.327 --> 00:20:25.980
Ray Tucker,

393
00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:28.461
manages the money for
half the Rams, all the Raiders,


394
00:20:28.505 --> 00:20:30.202
everybody you ever saw on TV,

395
00:20:30.246 --> 00:20:32.030
5% off the top.

396
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.989
Carter Davis, oil.

397
00:20:37.253 --> 00:20:40.952
Ricky Holtz, builds airports.

398
00:20:40.995 --> 00:20:44.173
Doc Gertz, used to be a
chiropractor, now he produces movies.


399
00:20:44.825 --> 00:20:46.740
And me.

400
00:20:46.784 --> 00:20:49.221
We don't come here to eat.

401
00:20:49.265 --> 00:20:51.702
So, what are you saying, Max?
I shouldn't order any food?


402
00:20:51.745 --> 00:20:54.357
Eat, eat.
Just don't look hungry.


403
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.532
George?

404
00:20:57.055 --> 00:20:58.752
Hello.

405
00:20:58.796 --> 00:20:59.830
I have Mrs. Brown
on the phone, sir.


406
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.972
Oh, thank you.

407
00:21:02.191 --> 00:21:04.410
- Hello? Hello?
- Hi.


408
00:21:04.454 --> 00:21:05.977
Hi. Hi. You still love me?

409
00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.283
Who was that?

410
00:21:07.326 --> 00:21:09.067
My secretary.
You ready for that?


411
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.895
I don't know how to act around her.

412
00:21:10.938 --> 00:21:12.539
I'm afraid she'll tell me
I'm doing something wrong.


413
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:14.725
How's your office?

414
00:21:14.768 --> 00:21:18.207
We could live in it. Guess how much money
I made in the first hour on the job today,


415
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.251
how much I earned for us?

416
00:21:19.295 --> 00:21:20.731
- I don't know.
- Just guess.


417
00:21:20.774 --> 00:21:23.821
- $100.
- Try $5,000.


418
00:21:23.864 --> 00:21:27.041
That's impossible.

419
00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:30.523
I swear to God, people here,
baby, can't wait to lay off their money.


420
00:21:30.567 --> 00:21:32.385
I had two doctors that
didn't wait for my whole pitch.


421
00:21:32.395 --> 00:21:34.555
They were in too big a hurry
to go generate more money!


422
00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:36.225
It's not to be believed!

423
00:21:36.268 --> 00:21:38.662
God, why did we take
so long to find this place?


424
00:21:38.705 --> 00:21:41.447
We're gonna be rich,
you hear me? Rich!


425
00:21:43.275 --> 00:21:44.972
I like what you did in there, kid.

426
00:21:45.016 --> 00:21:46.486
You put in a good
day, made a good dollar.

427
00:21:46.496 --> 00:21:48.367
We can go home, and have our drink.

428
00:21:48.411 --> 00:21:49.325
Like the house?

429
00:21:49.368 --> 00:21:51.327
Beautiful, Max.
Thanks a lot.


430
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.677
It's only rented by the week.

431
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.332
Out here, you gotta start
scoring baskets right off the bench


432
00:21:56.375 --> 00:21:57.246
or you're out of the game.

433
00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:58.324
Don't worry about me, Max.

434
00:21:58.334 --> 00:22:00.597
This is the work
I was meant to do.

435
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.382
You can sell, no question.
You got an instinct about that.


436
00:22:03.426 --> 00:22:05.244
You know, selling's more
important to me than money.


437
00:22:05.254 --> 00:22:07.594
Every time I sell something, it
means somebody believes in me.


438
00:22:07.604 --> 00:22:09.693
Right.

439
00:22:09.736 --> 00:22:12.391
First month, build a little bank account.

440
00:22:12.435 --> 00:22:16.352
Then after that, I expect you to
pay your fair share of the rent, okay?


441
00:22:16.395 --> 00:22:17.821
- Okay, Max, no problem.
- All right.


442
00:22:17.831 --> 00:22:19.268
This isn't your car.

443
00:22:19.311 --> 00:22:20.346
Excuse me, this isn't his car.

444
00:22:20.356 --> 00:22:22.271
No, it's yours.

445
00:22:22.314 --> 00:22:24.098
You need a car in LA.

446
00:22:24.142 --> 00:22:26.275
You expect me to be your chauffeur?

447
00:22:26.318 --> 00:22:28.581
Go on, get behind the wheel.

448
00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:30.322
Jesus!

449
00:22:30.366 --> 00:22:32.803
Max, this is a Mercedes!

450
00:22:32.846 --> 00:22:35.284
Don't have a coronary.
It's only a lease.


451
00:22:35.327 --> 00:22:38.287
Down the road, if you want to
buy it, I'll make you a good deal.


452
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.332
In the meantime, enjoy it.

453
00:22:40.376 --> 00:22:42.334
I don't know what to say, Max.

454
00:22:43.857 --> 00:22:45.816
That's a first for me.

455
00:22:45.859 --> 00:22:47.078
Get behind the wheel.

456
00:22:47.121 --> 00:22:49.123
Yes, sir.

457
00:22:53.127 --> 00:22:54.259
You can find your way home?

458
00:22:54.303 --> 00:22:55.695
Yeah, I think so.

459
00:22:55.739 --> 00:22:57.828
He thinks so.
Go on, get out of here.


460
00:22:57.871 --> 00:22:59.482
Tomorrow morning,

461
00:22:59.525 --> 00:23:01.658
- we'll make some more money together. Right?
- Right.


462
00:23:05.749 --> 00:23:07.141
Got a new guy,
huh, Mr. Sherman?


463
00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:10.101
Yep. This one
could be a keeper.


464
00:23:13.278 --> 00:23:15.062
This is my spot.

465
00:23:15.106 --> 00:23:17.141
A girl comes to dinner with me,
she knows where she stands.


466
00:23:17.151 --> 00:23:19.328
- Still there?
- What?


467
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.897
- The Mercedes.
- What Mercedes?


468
00:23:23.941 --> 00:23:26.030
You think that's funny?

469
00:23:27.379 --> 00:23:28.859
Okay, don't ever do that to me again.

470
00:23:30.513 --> 00:23:31.765
There'll be a bank on the corner here,

471
00:23:31.775 --> 00:23:33.385
We're negotiating with B of A.

472
00:23:33.429 --> 00:23:34.985
Over at that end, a frozen yogurt joint,

473
00:23:34.995 --> 00:23:36.214
fish and chips next,

474
00:23:36.257 --> 00:23:38.172
dynamite new Mexican franchise,

475
00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:40.392
and a possible fitness and aerobics center,

476
00:23:40.436 --> 00:23:42.116
which is nice 'cause it brings in traffic.

477
00:23:42.133 --> 00:23:43.656
I'll put in $75,000.

478
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.528
Great.
I'll need a check.


479
00:23:50.184 --> 00:23:52.230
I'll pay cash.

480
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:57.540
Cash?

481
00:23:57.583 --> 00:23:59.368
What kind of business are you in, Bob?

482
00:23:59.411 --> 00:24:01.108
Leisure activities.

483
00:24:03.633 --> 00:24:06.897
...three, four,
en seconde, one,


484
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.161
two, three, high tight kick,

485
00:24:10.204 --> 00:24:13.338
and five, six, seven, to plie.

486
00:24:13.382 --> 00:24:17.429
And one, two, three, four.

487
00:24:17.473 --> 00:24:22.086
En seconde, one, two, three, tight kick,

488
00:24:22.129 --> 00:24:25.437
five, six, seven, plie...

489
00:24:25.481 --> 00:24:28.701
♪ Happy birthday to you

490
00:24:28.745 --> 00:24:32.139
♪ Happy birthday to you

491
00:24:32.183 --> 00:24:36.100
♪ Happy birthday
Love of my life ♪


492
00:24:36.143 --> 00:24:41.018
♪ Happy birthday to you

493
00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:42.846
Thank you.
It isn't my birthday.


494
00:24:42.889 --> 00:24:44.238
Excuse me, ladies.

495
00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:45.534
Who says it isn't?
Sorry. Excuse me, sorry.


496
00:24:45.544 --> 00:24:46.719
Come on.

497
00:24:46.763 --> 00:24:48.155
Excuse me.

498
00:24:48.199 --> 00:24:50.984
I love you so much.

499
00:24:51.028 --> 00:24:53.596
- Now...
- What?


500
00:24:53.639 --> 00:24:54.978
You remember?
The James Bond movie?


501
00:24:54.988 --> 00:24:58.209
- Yeah.
- Remember?


502
00:24:58.252 --> 00:24:59.602
How you went crazy for the car?

503
00:24:59.645 --> 00:25:01.081
Oh, Lenny!

504
00:25:03.997 --> 00:25:05.477
Can we afford this?

505
00:25:05.521 --> 00:25:08.306
I don't know.

506
00:25:08.349 --> 00:25:09.776
I had to work a
whole month to buy it.

507
00:25:09.786 --> 00:25:11.483
Oh, Lenny!

508
00:25:11.527 --> 00:25:13.267
It's beautiful!

509
00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:14.704
Ooh!

510
00:25:17.097 --> 00:25:19.230
- He's adorable!
- She is.


511
00:25:19.273 --> 00:25:21.014
- Where did you get her?
- City pound.


512
00:25:21.058 --> 00:25:23.930
I got you a $40,000 car
and a $2 mutt. Go figure.


513
00:25:34.288 --> 00:25:35.594
Hi.

514
00:25:37.074 --> 00:25:38.249
Here's your ticket.

515
00:25:45.561 --> 00:25:47.204
You didn't tell me
there'd be valet parking.


516
00:25:47.214 --> 00:25:50.043
I didn't know.
Classy guy.


517
00:25:50.087 --> 00:25:51.218
Where's he get his money?

518
00:25:51.262 --> 00:25:52.785
Washing cars.

519
00:25:58.487 --> 00:26:00.271
Lenny Brown!

520
00:26:00.314 --> 00:26:02.491
You made it, man!
Good, good, how are you?


521
00:26:02.534 --> 00:26:03.753
Joel, this is my wife, Linda.

522
00:26:03.796 --> 00:26:05.276
What else?

523
00:26:05.319 --> 00:26:08.018
A real person, and lovely to look at.

524
00:26:08.061 --> 00:26:09.585
I'm charmed right out of my socks.

525
00:26:09.628 --> 00:26:11.021
See?

526
00:26:11.064 --> 00:26:12.326
Hey, everybody!

527
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.894
This is Lenny Brown, who is so hot,

528
00:26:14.938 --> 00:26:17.178
he's gonna make the rest of us
look like welfare mothers.


529
00:26:18.898 --> 00:26:20.073
And his charming wife...

530
00:26:20.117 --> 00:26:21.553
- Linda.
- Linda.


531
00:26:21.597 --> 00:26:23.816
Eat, drink, make contacts.

532
00:26:25.601 --> 00:26:27.341
Where did you say you met him?

533
00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:28.952
Oh, he bought into a deal.

534
00:26:28.995 --> 00:26:31.520
He's a young guy with 42 car
washes and mega tax problems.


535
00:26:31.563 --> 00:26:33.478
Want to eat something?
Here's a little buffet.


536
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.091
He throws a nice party.

537
00:26:38.135 --> 00:26:40.398
What's really nice is
Uncle Sam pays for half.


538
00:26:40.441 --> 00:26:42.487
And he wasn't even invited.

539
00:26:46.447 --> 00:26:48.145
I'll, uh, call you tomorrow.

540
00:26:55.718 --> 00:26:58.329
I just made a sale.

541
00:26:58.372 --> 00:26:59.450
- That's good, Lenny.
- Good?


542
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.593
My commission's going to be $26,000.

543
00:27:01.637 --> 00:27:03.552
While you were sipping a glass of wine,

544
00:27:03.595 --> 00:27:06.772
while I was munching, like,
a handful of macadamia nuts.


545
00:27:06.816 --> 00:27:08.600
He's talking to a friend of his.

546
00:27:08.644 --> 00:27:10.776
Suppose the friend
wants in. Don't look.


547
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.125
God.

548
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:14.345
You okay?

549
00:27:14.388 --> 00:27:15.564
I feel a little out of place.

550
00:27:15.607 --> 00:27:17.522
You are.

551
00:27:17.566 --> 00:27:19.785
You're the best-looking woman here.

552
00:27:19.829 --> 00:27:22.135
People here are a little strange.

553
00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:23.920
Talented people can be strange.

554
00:27:23.963 --> 00:27:27.184
The discretionary spending
power at this party is enormous.


555
00:27:27.227 --> 00:27:29.621
- Then maybe that's it.
- Come on.


556
00:27:29.665 --> 00:27:31.405
You're not enjoying
yourself? Come on.


557
00:27:33.582 --> 00:27:35.486
I'd rather be home with you.
Is that so terrible?


558
00:27:35.496 --> 00:27:37.629
- Lenny!
- Michael.


559
00:27:37.673 --> 00:27:40.371
Have you met Rochelle yet?
She lives with Joel.


560
00:27:40.414 --> 00:27:42.460
I am not living with Joel.

561
00:27:42.503 --> 00:27:44.897
I'm a stewardess for
a major airline, mister.


562
00:27:44.941 --> 00:27:47.160
Sometimes I stay here when I'm in town,

563
00:27:47.204 --> 00:27:48.161
but I do not live here.

564
00:27:48.205 --> 00:27:50.250
Excuse me. My mistake.

565
00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:52.513
You think I have to depend
on people like Joel?


566
00:27:52.557 --> 00:27:54.646
Listen, pal, I've been on planes

567
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.159
with people who took me out to dinner,

568
00:27:56.169 --> 00:27:58.476
then I let them
take me back to their hotels


569
00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:00.391
and the next morning,
they took me to Cartier's


570
00:28:00.434 --> 00:28:02.262
and told me to
pick out anything I wanted.

571
00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:04.777
And I'm gonna live in LA with
Joel Miller, who thinks he's a rajah


572
00:28:04.787 --> 00:28:06.484
because he's got a couple of car washes?

573
00:28:06.527 --> 00:28:07.964
Give me a small fucking break!

574
00:28:09.705 --> 00:28:12.272
I think Lenny and Linda were
on their way home, Rochelle.


575
00:28:12.316 --> 00:28:13.404
Say good night, princess.

576
00:28:13.447 --> 00:28:15.449
Good. Go home.

577
00:28:15.493 --> 00:28:18.714
Goodbye.
Good night. Get fucked.


578
00:28:18.757 --> 00:28:22.587
Call me a schmuck,
but I love the little bitch.


579
00:28:22.631 --> 00:28:24.502
It's, uh, it's the coke talking, guys.

580
00:28:24.545 --> 00:28:27.287
You wouldn't... You wouldn't
know her when she's straight.


581
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:28.670
I got to keep
her away from the coke,

582
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.509
got to keep her away from Michael.

583
00:28:31.552 --> 00:28:33.337
Life, a continuous struggle, huh?

584
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.338
Good night, Joel.

585
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:35.208
Take care, kids.

586
00:28:35.252 --> 00:28:36.427
Thank you.

587
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.868
I didn't know she
was whacked out on coke.

588
00:28:42.912 --> 00:28:44.261
They were all on something.

589
00:28:44.304 --> 00:28:46.002
Thank you.

590
00:28:46.045 --> 00:28:47.699
I didn't see anything, did you?

591
00:28:47.743 --> 00:28:49.701
You didn't have to see anything.

592
00:28:49.745 --> 00:28:51.616
Money's the real drug around here, okay?

593
00:28:53.487 --> 00:28:55.315
Thank you.

594
00:29:04.498 --> 00:29:06.457
Nice house though.

595
00:29:08.285 --> 00:29:09.685
So I thought the old lady was lost.

596
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:11.505
I mean, she was wearing
this, like, babushka


597
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:13.899
and this thing you would
throw over an old sofa.


598
00:29:13.943 --> 00:29:16.467
She wrote a check for
$150,000, I got the message.


599
00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.950
So, I sent over to Berlitz for
some guy who could speak Farsi.


600
00:29:18.991 --> 00:29:21.472
An hour later, she's a partner,
all handshakes and smiles.


601
00:29:23.343 --> 00:29:24.552
I got the printers working overtime

602
00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:26.303
because of you, turning out brochures.

603
00:29:26.346 --> 00:29:27.478
Nobody reads them.

604
00:29:27.521 --> 00:29:28.522
They read them.

605
00:29:29.785 --> 00:29:32.222
Come on in.

606
00:29:32.265 --> 00:29:33.092
You're late.

607
00:29:33.136 --> 00:29:34.311
Hi, Max.

608
00:29:34.354 --> 00:29:36.792
- Hey!
- Hi, sweetheart.


609
00:29:36.835 --> 00:29:38.924
What's going on?
What are you doing here?


610
00:29:38.968 --> 00:29:40.839
"What's going on?"

611
00:29:40.883 --> 00:29:43.102
That's the problem
with the younger generation.


612
00:29:43.146 --> 00:29:45.757
No sentiment.

613
00:29:45.801 --> 00:29:48.717
One year ago today, you started here.

614
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.725
To my best salesman and his beautiful wife.

615
00:29:56.768 --> 00:29:57.856
Oh...

616
00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.510
It's been a wonderful year.

617
00:29:59.553 --> 00:30:01.077
You don't miss New York?

618
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.982
Sure, Max, maybe someday
we'll go back for a visit,


619
00:30:02.992 --> 00:30:04.384
if I can ever find the time.

620
00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:06.822
Find time to play, kids.
Find time to play.


621
00:30:06.865 --> 00:30:08.475
It's funny you should mention that.

622
00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:10.695
I bought a plane today.

623
00:30:10.739 --> 00:30:11.991
You mean like a
"fly in the sky" plane?

624
00:30:12.001 --> 00:30:13.872
It's a good tax write-off,

625
00:30:13.916 --> 00:30:15.908
Plus we finance it and I get
to write off the interest as well.


626
00:30:15.918 --> 00:30:17.658
A man needs his toys, Linda.

627
00:30:18.398 --> 00:30:19.965
It's just a prop job.

628
00:30:21.401 --> 00:30:22.489
Who's gonna fly this plane?

629
00:30:22.533 --> 00:30:25.536
I'll hire a guy.

630
00:30:29.192 --> 00:30:31.890
I'm just trying it out to see if
I like having my own plane,


631
00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:33.413
then I'll go onto a jet.

632
00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:35.589
It's fine, Lenny.
Just fine.


633
00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:36.808
- Okay, Cabo San Lucas.
- Ole.


634
00:30:36.852 --> 00:30:38.592
Some Mexican food, maybe a little business.

635
00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:39.942
Let's fly.

636
00:30:52.128 --> 00:30:54.347
Taxi! Taxi!

637
00:30:54.391 --> 00:30:56.610
Por favor!

638
00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:58.656
Bueno!

639
00:30:58.699 --> 00:31:00.353
Okay, I could have
just said, "Cabo."


640
00:31:00.397 --> 00:31:02.138
Cabo, Cabo.

641
00:31:03.139 --> 00:31:04.793
Cabo San Lucas.

642
00:31:04.836 --> 00:31:06.359
All right.
How are you doing, pal?


643
00:31:08.709 --> 00:31:12.061
The port!

644
00:31:19.982 --> 00:31:22.506
It takes $100,000 to
get in on the bidding.

645
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:23.899
No problem.

646
00:31:23.942 --> 00:31:26.249
I think this place
could be a gold mine.

647
00:31:26.292 --> 00:31:29.382
It's non-refundable,
Lenny, if you back out.


648
00:31:29.426 --> 00:31:31.820
Joel, I don't back out of things.

649
00:31:31.863 --> 00:31:33.734
I know. I just feel
I got to tell you.


650
00:31:33.778 --> 00:31:35.127
I'm in.

651
00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:36.389
Gracias!

652
00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:38.870
Buenas noches!

653
00:31:38.914 --> 00:31:40.611
I got a hunch
we can get our money

654
00:31:40.654 --> 00:31:41.950
out of that joint in the first year.

655
00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.223
You never know, 
Lenny, there's a risk.

656
00:31:44.267 --> 00:31:45.998
I don't think either one of
us is looking for a passbook,


657
00:31:46.008 --> 00:31:47.748
savings account kind of investment.

658
00:31:47.792 --> 00:31:49.272
I'm looking for a free toaster.

659
00:31:49.315 --> 00:31:51.752
Cabo San Lucas is gonna be
bigger than Puerto Vallarta.


660
00:31:51.796 --> 00:31:53.624
The big bucks will roll in the winter.

661
00:31:53.667 --> 00:31:55.452
So, let me ask you this.

662
00:31:55.495 --> 00:31:57.923
Why are we taking in partners?
What's wrong with just you and me?


663
00:31:57.933 --> 00:32:01.153
Michael's put in $150,000, there's
a few shortstops who have signed.


664
00:32:01.197 --> 00:32:02.676
I guess you could buy them out,

665
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.374
But they'll want a little profit.

666
00:32:04.417 --> 00:32:07.377
So? Fair enough.

667
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.423
Half a million ought
to cure it for you.

668
00:32:10.467 --> 00:32:12.425
Half a million?

669
00:32:12.469 --> 00:32:14.950
No, bad idea, kiddo. Spread
the risk. That's the smart move.


670
00:32:14.993 --> 00:32:16.690
Joel, I can swing it, man.

671
00:32:16.734 --> 00:32:19.476
I just got to rearrange
a few things, you know?


672
00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:21.391
- You're about a mover.
- Yeah.


673
00:32:21.434 --> 00:32:22.740
Okay.

674
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.925
We should've stayed over.

675
00:32:33.969 --> 00:32:35.709
The whole idea of
going to Cabo San Lucas

676
00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.668
for dinner is to
come back the same night.

677
00:32:37.711 --> 00:32:39.235
Any postal worker

678
00:32:39.278 --> 00:32:41.411
can go to Cabo on a weekend excursion.

679
00:32:41.454 --> 00:32:42.455
Ah!

680
00:32:42.499 --> 00:32:46.024
Caramba! I find it.

681
00:32:46.068 --> 00:32:48.026
Oh, God, I'm so tired.

682
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.158
Hi, Mitzi.

683
00:32:51.464 --> 00:32:53.640
- Lenny?
- Yeah.


684
00:32:53.684 --> 00:32:55.425
Uh, about that nightclub...

685
00:32:55.468 --> 00:32:57.949
Yeah, how about that?
We can have our own joint.


686
00:32:57.993 --> 00:33:00.038
Everyone in the world
wants to own a nightclub,


687
00:33:00.082 --> 00:33:02.040
but we're actually
gonna do it. It's so great.


688
00:33:02.084 --> 00:33:04.521
I know, and I think I
know what it means to you,


689
00:33:04.564 --> 00:33:06.566
but we're behind on the
American Express bill...


690
00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.439
- Oh, Linda. Linda, please.
- ...and on top of the airplane...


691
00:33:12.616 --> 00:33:14.835
I mean, even after all
this, you think I'm a bum?


692
00:33:17.838 --> 00:33:20.972
I'm making money so fast over
at Max's, they can't keep track of it.


693
00:33:21.016 --> 00:33:23.670
Everybody in town thinks I'm a firecracker

694
00:33:23.714 --> 00:33:25.097
and my own wife
still thinks I'm a bum.

695
00:33:25.107 --> 00:33:26.499
Lenny...

696
00:33:27.718 --> 00:33:30.242
I think you're a genius.

697
00:33:30.286 --> 00:33:33.071
I just don't want you to
feel like you're on a treadmill,


698
00:33:33.115 --> 00:33:34.943
having to make more and more money

699
00:33:34.986 --> 00:33:37.771
to pay for things we bought
that don't really need.


700
00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:39.817
The way things are going,

701
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.994
the money going out won't be
missed if it never comes back.


702
00:33:43.038 --> 00:33:45.779
When you get to where we are,
nothing can touch you.


703
00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:49.566
And you're with me. We're
together. We're like a team.


704
00:33:49.609 --> 00:33:52.569
You think I would ever

705
00:33:52.612 --> 00:33:55.050
let anything hurt you?

706
00:33:55.093 --> 00:33:56.573
Ever?

707
00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:02.753
Good morning, Veronica, Pat.

708
00:34:06.017 --> 00:34:07.801
Good morning, Alice.

709
00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:08.802
How are you?

710
00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.456
Hi, Max.

711
00:34:14.634 --> 00:34:16.419
Ahem.

712
00:34:17.898 --> 00:34:20.205
Okay, so who died around here?

713
00:34:20.249 --> 00:34:23.817
So when do you show
up at 10:00 like a banker?


714
00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:25.776
Hey, Max, what happened?
A deal fell through?


715
00:34:25.819 --> 00:34:26.995
We're getting audited?
What?


716
00:34:27.038 --> 00:34:28.779
You don't read the Journal?

717
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.786
You ought to read the Journal.

718
00:34:41.096 --> 00:34:43.620
Well, so the lawyers
will find a way around it.


719
00:34:45.926 --> 00:34:47.319
It's not even close to passage.

720
00:34:47.363 --> 00:34:48.929
This may never happen.

721
00:34:48.973 --> 00:34:51.584
- You don't get it.
- What's to get?


722
00:34:51.628 --> 00:34:53.847
To get is, I've been
on the phone for an hour


723
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.545
and no one's returning my calls.

724
00:34:55.588 --> 00:34:58.069
To get is, so far this morning,
while you're playing banker,


725
00:34:58.113 --> 00:35:01.594
Shirley has taken 11 calls
from investors who want out.


726
00:35:01.638 --> 00:35:03.596
To get is, three other
lawyers have called saying


727
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.164
they got to have their
deposits back by this afternoon


728
00:35:06.208 --> 00:35:09.037
or they're gonna find
any angle to sue on.

729
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.648
We're in deep shit.

730
00:35:11.691 --> 00:35:13.563
It's starting to sink in.

731
00:35:13.606 --> 00:35:16.827
Mr. Michures,
we made a deal.


732
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.352
Your client is committed.

733
00:35:20.396 --> 00:35:22.876
Hey, even if they didn't allow a deduction

734
00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.640
for dollar one, it'd be a great investment.

735
00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:26.663
Believe me, Vic, you're
gonna get the write-off.


736
00:35:26.706 --> 00:35:28.056
Some asshole in Washington

737
00:35:28.099 --> 00:35:30.754
is just trying to
start a panic, that's all.


738
00:35:32.234 --> 00:35:34.149
Don't tell me about your lawyers because...

739
00:35:34.192 --> 00:35:36.238
Vic? Vic? Hey, don't!
Wait, Vic! Vic!


740
00:35:38.327 --> 00:35:40.851
Sorry to call so late,
but I had a chance...

741
00:35:40.894 --> 00:35:42.722
How's it going, world-beater? Any takers?

742
00:35:42.766 --> 00:35:45.856
Hey, can I just put you on hold for
a second, please? Yeah. Thank you.


743
00:35:45.899 --> 00:35:47.684
Man, people are spooked, Max.

744
00:35:47.727 --> 00:35:49.207
They don't know how to handle rumors.

745
00:35:49.251 --> 00:35:50.720
They'll come around, right?
They've got to.


746
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.123
Why is that?

747
00:35:52.167 --> 00:35:54.082
Because everybody wants
California real estate.


748
00:35:54.125 --> 00:35:55.213
Don't they?

749
00:35:55.257 --> 00:35:56.388
Sure, they do.

750
00:35:56.432 --> 00:35:57.955
But they don't want it from us,

751
00:35:57.998 --> 00:36:00.697
With us taking 20% off the top,

752
00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.220
unless it's got that tax break.

753
00:36:02.264 --> 00:36:03.700
Without that,

754
00:36:03.743 --> 00:36:06.746
why should they want to
buy a shit house from us?


755
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.487
Oh, don't take it so hard.

756
00:36:08.531 --> 00:36:11.490
This is the first scare
we've had in this business.


757
00:36:11.534 --> 00:36:13.666
If nothing else happens
in the next couple of months,


758
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.625
maybe six months...

759
00:36:15.668 --> 00:36:18.976
we could be back to speed.

760
00:36:19.019 --> 00:36:21.969
You mean it's going to be six months
before we have any money coming in here?


761
00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:23.241
Worse.

762
00:36:23.285 --> 00:36:25.983
We'll have to dig into the piggy bank,

763
00:36:26.026 --> 00:36:27.746
save that option
on the La Cienega property.


764
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.944
Ought to kick in for the overhead here.

765
00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:32.424
Think of it as a vacation.

766
00:36:32.468 --> 00:36:34.992
Take a trip.

767
00:36:35.035 --> 00:36:37.734
Spend some of that heavy
money you've been making.


768
00:36:37.777 --> 00:36:40.911
And me, I'm gonna go home.

769
00:36:40.954 --> 00:36:44.001
And I'm gonna have me a drink.

770
00:36:44.044 --> 00:36:47.004
And then I'm gonna have a hot tub.

771
00:36:47.047 --> 00:36:50.312
All right, so we
got us a rainy day.

772
00:36:52.227 --> 00:36:55.143
Can't go on forever. Good
night, kid. Don't forget the lights.


773
00:36:55.186 --> 00:36:57.188
Good night, Max.

774
00:36:57.232 --> 00:36:59.234
Hi, Doctor.
I'm sorry I kept you on hold.


775
00:36:59.277 --> 00:37:00.974
Hello?

776
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.073
Lenny Brown speaking.

777
00:37:13.117 --> 00:37:14.543
Lenny, have you forgotten the party?

778
00:37:14.553 --> 00:37:15.772
What party?

779
00:37:15.815 --> 00:37:17.948
Have you had a bad day?

780
00:37:17.991 --> 00:37:20.211
Joel's party!
Oh, shit!


781
00:37:20.255 --> 00:37:22.213
Hey, we don't have to go.

782
00:37:22.257 --> 00:37:24.215
We have to go.
I'll be home in half an hour.


783
00:37:24.259 --> 00:37:25.259
Joel's...

784
00:37:29.264 --> 00:37:31.831
Earth calling Lenny.

785
00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:34.182
Linda, don't try to be cute, not tonight.

786
00:37:35.574 --> 00:37:37.185
You like it when I'm cute.

787
00:37:38.447 --> 00:37:39.752
Is it business?

788
00:37:39.796 --> 00:37:41.014
Yeah, it's business.

789
00:37:42.538 --> 00:37:45.018
Whatever it is, we're gonna be all right.

790
00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:47.020
What?

791
00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:48.283
Yeah, it must be nice.

792
00:37:48.326 --> 00:37:50.198
If it's money, we can cut back.

793
00:37:50.241 --> 00:37:52.200
I can go back to work.
I'd like to, anyway.


794
00:37:52.243 --> 00:37:53.984
It's boring doing nothing all day.

795
00:37:54.027 --> 00:37:56.029
Boring?

796
00:37:56.073 --> 00:37:59.076
I've been busting my balls out
there so you can live like a queen,


797
00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:01.252
and now you tell me it's been boring?

798
00:38:01.296 --> 00:38:03.776
It must be bad. You
hardly ever start a fight.


799
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.039
It's bad.

800
00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:07.814
We're several hundred
thousand dollars in debt,


801
00:38:07.824 --> 00:38:09.478
and we got no more income.

802
00:38:09.521 --> 00:38:10.870
How?

803
00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.616
Let's not go.

804
00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.836
Let's go home.
Let's hold each other.


805
00:38:19.879 --> 00:38:21.229
That's what they expect us to do,

806
00:38:21.272 --> 00:38:23.143
to lie in the
shadows and lick our wounds.

807
00:38:23.187 --> 00:38:25.189
They'll know I've been beaten.

808
00:38:25.233 --> 00:38:26.930
Hey, even if they have to take everything,

809
00:38:26.973 --> 00:38:28.148
if we have to go bankrupt,

810
00:38:28.192 --> 00:38:29.846
we still have each other.

811
00:38:29.889 --> 00:38:31.848
Linda, I'm scared.
I'm scared.


812
00:38:31.891 --> 00:38:33.850
Baby, we'll make it

813
00:38:33.893 --> 00:38:37.027
as long as we have each other.

814
00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.290
I wanted you to have everything.

815
00:38:39.334 --> 00:38:41.814
Lenny.

816
00:38:41.858 --> 00:38:44.077
Come on.

817
00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:55.567
Lenny! Linda!

818
00:38:56.699 --> 00:38:58.831
I'm glad you came.

819
00:39:00.442 --> 00:39:02.531
Uh, hey, buddy, can you spare a dime?

820
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.403
Seriously, Joel,

821
00:39:05.447 --> 00:39:07.144
could you lend me a little something

822
00:39:07.187 --> 00:39:09.842
until my brother straightens out?

823
00:39:09.886 --> 00:39:11.017
He's a hunchback.

824
00:39:13.237 --> 00:39:14.847
See?
Didn't I tell you?


825
00:39:14.891 --> 00:39:16.414
You can't keep a good man down.

826
00:39:16.458 --> 00:39:19.156
This guy doesn't cave in
because of the fucking media.


827
00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:21.148
He's already into something
else, huh? Incredible.


828
00:39:21.158 --> 00:39:22.290
So, do we party?

829
00:39:22.333 --> 00:39:23.987
Yeah, absolutely.

830
00:39:30.298 --> 00:39:31.821
Talk to me, Lenny.
I'm your pal.


831
00:39:31.864 --> 00:39:33.997
It's closed down. Nobody's
doing any business, Joel.


832
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.128
I'm in deep shit.

833
00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:37.348
You don't sell real estate deals.

834
00:39:37.392 --> 00:39:39.263
You sell Lenny Brown, right?

835
00:39:39.307 --> 00:39:41.134
That means you can sell anything, man.

836
00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.920
Airplanes, computers, this shit.

837
00:39:43.963 --> 00:39:45.138
Go ahead, help yourself.

838
00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.314
No, I never touch the stuff.

839
00:39:46.357 --> 00:39:48.141
It'll take you off your ass.

840
00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:50.927
Joel, I don't know anything
about computers or airplanes, man.


841
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:52.842
I'd have to start all over again.

842
00:39:52.885 --> 00:39:54.931
What is this negative talk?

843
00:39:54.974 --> 00:39:56.628
You're killing the old fireball.

844
00:39:57.977 --> 00:40:00.545
You need a boost, kid.

845
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:02.939
You need to clear away the cobwebs.

846
00:40:02.982 --> 00:40:04.854
Joel, I got enough problems, all right?

847
00:40:04.897 --> 00:40:07.204
What? Do you think
it'll be habit-forming?


848
00:40:07.247 --> 00:40:09.641
Do you think you'll have
a monkey on your back?


849
00:40:09.685 --> 00:40:11.164
It's a boost.
That's all.


850
00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:13.123
Come on. It's a tough
track we're on, boychik.


851
00:40:13.166 --> 00:40:14.907
The winners always have an edge.

852
00:40:14.951 --> 00:40:16.387
It's 90% mental out there.

853
00:40:16.431 --> 00:40:18.171
You accomplish what you trick your brain

854
00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:20.391
into believing you can accomplish.

855
00:40:20.435 --> 00:40:23.742
Faith may move mountains.
This stuff makes them fly.


856
00:40:26.354 --> 00:40:29.661
If you've never tried it,
you're the last one in town.


857
00:40:31.533 --> 00:40:33.622
What's the problem?
Was there a problem?


858
00:40:33.665 --> 00:40:35.885
See this guy here? You
know that park in Beverly Hills?


859
00:40:35.928 --> 00:40:38.888
I'm gonna build a statue in
that park with a plaque that says,


860
00:40:38.931 --> 00:40:41.760
"To my best friend, Joel,
who saved my life."


861
00:40:41.804 --> 00:40:43.414
What are friends for?

862
00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:45.024
Must have been some pep talk.

863
00:40:45.068 --> 00:40:46.939
Was there a problem?
You know,


864
00:40:46.983 --> 00:40:49.192
you don't have to know the
product, you have to know the people.


865
00:40:49.202 --> 00:40:51.204
Who knows people better than Lenny Brown?

866
00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:53.685
I'm going to sell 747s internationally.

867
00:40:53.729 --> 00:40:55.339
Look.

868
00:40:55.383 --> 00:40:57.244
That's wonderful, Lenny.
How do you get started?


869
00:40:57.254 --> 00:40:59.430
Can you imagine the commission on a 747?

870
00:40:59.474 --> 00:41:01.988
You're gonna wonder "What was
Lenny Brown doing, pissing away his time


871
00:41:01.998 --> 00:41:03.391
on petty real estate scams,

872
00:41:03.434 --> 00:41:04.914
wondering what some bureaucrat

873
00:41:04.957 --> 00:41:06.916
was gonna leak to the
papers in Washington?"


874
00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:09.440
Cocktails. Want another
drink? Another... Yeah, come on.


875
00:41:12.182 --> 00:41:13.531
Dance, ballerina, dance.

876
00:41:13.575 --> 00:41:14.967
What?

877
00:42:06.279 --> 00:42:09.282
Sweetheart, I'm exhausted.

878
00:42:10.762 --> 00:42:12.024
Let's go to bed.

879
00:42:12.068 --> 00:42:13.591
One more dance.

880
00:42:13.635 --> 00:42:17.247
The neighbors.
I can't keep my eyes open.


881
00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:19.902
They've discovered a cure for that.

882
00:42:34.873 --> 00:42:37.136
Lenny, is that what I think it is?

883
00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.138
Don't turn little old lady on me, okay?

884
00:42:39.182 --> 00:42:41.053
It's Joel's.
I needed a boost.


885
00:42:41.097 --> 00:42:43.621
You saw me before the party,
right? I wanted to be dead.


886
00:42:43.665 --> 00:42:45.710
Now I got my old energy
and confidence back.


887
00:42:45.754 --> 00:42:47.930
I got plans to get
us out of this mess.

888
00:42:47.973 --> 00:42:51.324
But cocaine, we never needed that before.

889
00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:53.370
Hey, come on.
You know what it's like?


890
00:42:53.413 --> 00:42:55.851
It's like good champagne, that's all.

891
00:42:55.894 --> 00:42:57.069
What's it do to you?

892
00:42:57.113 --> 00:42:58.723
It bumps up your natural energy level.

893
00:42:58.767 --> 00:43:00.420
Look.

894
00:43:00.464 --> 00:43:02.335
Look at that, see?

895
00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.120
I've watched Rochelle.

896
00:43:04.163 --> 00:43:05.938
All it does for her is
turn her into a real bitch.


897
00:43:05.948 --> 00:43:08.516
That's Rochelle. She
started as a real bitch. Here.


898
00:43:08.559 --> 00:43:10.561
You sniff this up.
If you don't like it,


899
00:43:10.605 --> 00:43:12.345
throw the rest in the pool.

900
00:43:33.584 --> 00:43:36.065
Hi, honey.

901
00:43:36.108 --> 00:43:38.850
I got it nailed down.
I've got the greatest idea


902
00:43:38.894 --> 00:43:41.592
for a medical and dental
leaseback plan. It's fail-safe.


903
00:43:41.636 --> 00:43:44.464
No matter what happens to
the new tax law, the crisis is over.


904
00:43:44.508 --> 00:43:46.728
Whoo, great!

905
00:43:50.296 --> 00:43:54.344
You want to sell helicopters?

906
00:43:54.387 --> 00:43:56.389
It's not the money, 
Max, you know?

907
00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:59.392
I just got to keep working.
I'll go stale.


908
00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:01.786
What about that leaseback idea you had?

909
00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.093
Nobody liked it.

910
00:44:04.136 --> 00:44:06.095
Okay. We're not
selling buildings now,


911
00:44:06.138 --> 00:44:08.184
but we sold a lot of buildings.

912
00:44:08.227 --> 00:44:10.229
They all need maintenance,

913
00:44:10.273 --> 00:44:11.525
which happens to be done by a company

914
00:44:11.535 --> 00:44:14.277
called Century West Maintenance Company.

915
00:44:16.322 --> 00:44:17.889
- Yours.
- Mine.


916
00:44:20.979 --> 00:44:22.981
Want to manage that?

917
00:44:23.025 --> 00:44:26.637
Get a small salary, keep using the car.

918
00:44:26.681 --> 00:44:30.162
Once in a while,
a free lunch on the account.


919
00:44:30.206 --> 00:44:33.252
Things will pick up here.
We'll be back where we were.


920
00:44:33.296 --> 00:44:36.255
You don't want to sell
helicopters. That's for losers.


921
00:44:42.435 --> 00:44:43.654
Mr. Brown,
how nice to see you.


922
00:44:43.698 --> 00:44:45.438
Nice to see you.

923
00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:46.265
Right this way, please.

924
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:48.137
Thank you.

925
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.911
What can I say? It was a
period of reorganization.


926
00:44:49.921 --> 00:44:51.662
Now it's time to come out and play.

927
00:44:51.706 --> 00:44:55.274
Isn't that sweet?

928
00:44:55.318 --> 00:44:58.451
We owe our friends a nice meal
and the pleasure of our company.


929
00:44:58.495 --> 00:45:03.195
Always a pleasure. I
love you guys. Good table.


930
00:45:03.239 --> 00:45:05.676
- Thank you, Roland.
- Enjoy your evening.


931
00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.668
Could we have a bottle of
Taittinger? Make it a magnum.


932
00:45:07.678 --> 00:45:08.984
Certainly, sir.

933
00:45:09.027 --> 00:45:10.725
Ooh.

934
00:45:10.768 --> 00:45:12.683
And after dinner, a little surprise.

935
00:45:12.727 --> 00:45:14.990
I love surprises.
I'm like a child.


936
00:45:15.033 --> 00:45:17.253
He is a child.
We're all children.


937
00:45:17.296 --> 00:45:19.037
We are going to
fly to fabulous Las Vegas

938
00:45:19.081 --> 00:45:20.778
for Steve Martin's midnight show.

939
00:45:20.822 --> 00:45:22.954
Well, excuse me!

940
00:45:22.998 --> 00:45:25.914
I knew you wouldn't cool
off for long. What's the deal?


941
00:45:25.957 --> 00:45:28.297
Something new, right? Something
you'll have to explain to a dummy like me?


942
00:45:28.307 --> 00:45:29.700
Something, maybe, real?

943
00:45:29.744 --> 00:45:31.702
Let's just say... 
Thank you very much.

944
00:45:31.746 --> 00:45:34.836
It involves plays of eurodollars
against oil shipments.


945
00:45:34.879 --> 00:45:37.708
Holy shit, you've left me
behind, buddy. Eurodollars?


946
00:45:49.154 --> 00:45:51.233
You got to give the impression
you're in motion, right?


947
00:45:51.243 --> 00:45:53.540
Even though he knows what you're
doing, you must make him think


948
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.725
you're doing something.

949
00:45:54.769 --> 00:45:56.509
Something mysterious, complex.

950
00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:58.163
- You know?
- Yeah.


951
00:45:58.207 --> 00:46:00.731
Big-bucks something.
Just keep in motion.


952
00:46:00.775 --> 00:46:02.951
One small question:
who's paying for all this?


953
00:46:02.994 --> 00:46:05.736
I dipped into Max's
maintenance account... - Lenny!


954
00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.540
For about $20,000.
Don't worry. It's nothing.


955
00:46:07.564 --> 00:46:09.740
He's not going to hold it
against his best salesman.


956
00:46:09.784 --> 00:46:11.776
- So I took a little cash for a few months.
- Are you sure?


957
00:46:11.786 --> 00:46:13.918
I left a personal check
in the safety-deposit box.


958
00:46:13.962 --> 00:46:15.746
Believe me, this is not a problem.

959
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:16.965
Yeah.

960
00:46:17.008 --> 00:46:18.749
A worthless, goddamn check!

961
00:46:18.793 --> 00:46:21.099
What are you getting hysterical
about, Max? It was a loan.


962
00:46:21.143 --> 00:46:24.494
In all my life, I never treated
anyone like I treated you!


963
00:46:24.537 --> 00:46:26.583
You were poor, 
I made you rich.

964
00:46:26.626 --> 00:46:28.716
You were drowning, 
I gave you a yacht!

965
00:46:28.759 --> 00:46:30.718
You stole from me.

966
00:46:30.761 --> 00:46:33.677
I treated you
like a son. $20,000!


967
00:46:33.721 --> 00:46:35.331
You want another check?
I'll write you...


968
00:46:35.374 --> 00:46:37.376
Your check is no damn good.

969
00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.988
You want to be a
liar as well as a thief?

970
00:46:42.817 --> 00:46:44.993
Tell me what to do.

971
00:46:50.912 --> 00:46:52.696
Just tell me, Max.

972
00:46:57.092 --> 00:47:00.399
You got to go. I can't have
you around here anymore.


973
00:47:32.431 --> 00:47:33.345
Hi, Tony.

974
00:47:33.389 --> 00:47:34.651
Mr. Brown.

975
00:47:36.218 --> 00:47:38.916
I'm sorry. The leasing
company took away your car.


976
00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.180
I cleaned out your personal
stuff. I've got it in the office.


977
00:47:50.406 --> 00:47:51.886
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

978
00:47:51.929 --> 00:47:53.365
Tony...

979
00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.153
Thanks.

980
00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:54.818
Mitzi!

981
00:48:56.907 --> 00:48:59.214
You didn't see a little black
and white dog, did you?


982
00:48:59.257 --> 00:49:01.259
No, ma'am.

983
00:49:01.303 --> 00:49:03.479
You didn't see a little black
and white dog, did you?


984
00:49:03.522 --> 00:49:04.654
Nuh-uh.

985
00:49:07.004 --> 00:49:08.745
Mitzi!

986
00:49:16.927 --> 00:49:18.276
Mitzi!

987
00:49:51.353 --> 00:49:52.528
Put it anywhere.

988
00:50:17.335 --> 00:50:20.251
Is it ready yet?

989
00:50:21.339 --> 00:50:23.689
Come and get it.

990
00:50:32.785 --> 00:50:35.745
I miss my puppy. I was
thinking what a great...


991
00:50:35.788 --> 00:50:37.573
Lenny! Lenny!

992
00:50:51.239 --> 00:50:52.892
Dr. Murcat.

993
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:56.200
He's going to be all right.

994
00:50:56.244 --> 00:50:57.810
Oh.

995
00:50:57.854 --> 00:51:00.552
Your husband's had
a phase 2 reaction to cocaine.


996
00:51:00.596 --> 00:51:02.554
How long has he been using the drug?

997
00:51:02.598 --> 00:51:04.034
Cocaine?

998
00:51:04.078 --> 00:51:05.156
Do you know how much he took?

999
00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:06.819
Dr. Guettier.

1000
00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:08.865
My husband doesn't use drugs.

1001
00:51:08.908 --> 00:51:11.781
He doesn't even drink anything
stronger than wine.


1002
00:51:11.824 --> 00:51:13.826
He'd been at a party.

1003
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.046
Somebody must've slipped him something.

1004
00:51:23.053 --> 00:51:24.402
Thank you.

1005
00:51:26.187 --> 00:51:27.275
Thanks.

1006
00:51:27.318 --> 00:51:28.318
Honey.

1007
00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:34.934
I was so scared, but I
didn't tell them anything.


1008
00:51:34.978 --> 00:51:36.762
You didn't use any
of that stuff, did you?

1009
00:51:36.806 --> 00:51:38.025
- No.
- Did you throw it out?


1010
00:51:38.068 --> 00:51:39.548
Of course I did.

1011
00:51:39.591 --> 00:51:41.018
I couldn't find Michael. I
had to buy it off the street.


1012
00:51:41.028 --> 00:51:42.845
That's what happens. And
I'm supposed to be smart.


1013
00:51:42.855 --> 00:51:44.466
What about the hospital bill?

1014
00:51:44.509 --> 00:51:47.034
Outright thieves. I put it on
the American Express card.


1015
00:51:52.604 --> 00:51:54.824
You got any?

1016
00:51:54.867 --> 00:51:56.173
You got any?

1017
00:51:56.217 --> 00:51:57.261
Yeah.

1018
00:51:57.305 --> 00:51:58.828
Where did you get it?

1019
00:51:58.871 --> 00:51:59.698
From Michael.

1020
00:51:59.742 --> 00:52:01.178
Good. Great.

1021
00:52:01.222 --> 00:52:03.050
Great.

1022
00:52:03.093 --> 00:52:04.921
He wanted to fuck me for it.

1023
00:52:04.964 --> 00:52:06.966
Son of a bitch!
I'll kill him, man!


1024
00:52:11.058 --> 00:52:13.582
Don't look at me like that.
I'd never do anything like that.


1025
00:52:13.625 --> 00:52:15.410
So how did you pay for it?

1026
00:52:15.453 --> 00:52:17.064
I hocked my ring.

1027
00:52:28.988 --> 00:52:30.164
What time is it?

1028
00:52:30.207 --> 00:52:31.991
12:30.

1029
00:52:33.167 --> 00:52:35.386
He's not here.

1030
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:37.649
He said
he'd be here at 12:00.


1031
00:52:37.693 --> 00:52:39.390
I know he said
he'd be here at 12:00.


1032
00:52:39.434 --> 00:52:42.001
I was the one
who talked to him, remember?

1033
00:52:42.045 --> 00:52:44.613
I wonder when it was you
started talking to me that way.


1034
00:52:48.486 --> 00:52:50.009
You want to wait?

1035
00:52:50.053 --> 00:52:51.228
Do you?

1036
00:52:53.056 --> 00:52:55.667
Maybe we should try someplace else.

1037
00:52:55.711 --> 00:52:56.886
Let's go.

1038
00:53:57.642 --> 00:53:59.035
Lenny.

1039
00:54:02.081 --> 00:54:05.084
Shh shh.

1040
00:54:05.128 --> 00:54:06.206
We don't even know this guy, man.

1041
00:54:06.216 --> 00:54:07.739
He's a total stranger to us, man.

1042
00:54:07.783 --> 00:54:10.438
We got to go. They're
going to call the police!


1043
00:54:10.481 --> 00:54:12.744
They say somebody
dumped him on the back porch.


1044
00:54:12.788 --> 00:54:14.964
I'm not going to live like this!

1045
00:54:15.007 --> 00:54:16.748
I don't care if Joel
is rich and I'm poor.

1046
00:54:16.792 --> 00:54:19.229
It doesn't matter
that everybody else has money.


1047
00:54:19.273 --> 00:54:21.623
I'd rather be a field hand
than live in this cesspool.


1048
00:54:21.666 --> 00:54:22.972
What's happened to us?

1049
00:54:23.015 --> 00:54:24.974
We got to get
out of this goddamn town!

1050
00:54:25.017 --> 00:54:27.498
Out of the hustles,
and the deals, the Joels,


1051
00:54:27.542 --> 00:54:29.761
and the coke and the goddamn pain!

1052
00:54:29.805 --> 00:54:31.459
This isn't just talk, is it, Lenny?

1053
00:54:31.502 --> 00:54:35.027
You saw that kid back there.
That could have been us like that.


1054
00:54:39.771 --> 00:54:40.772
Then I can tell you.

1055
00:54:40.816 --> 00:54:42.339
What?

1056
00:54:44.602 --> 00:54:47.257
I'm pregnant.

1057
00:54:58.355 --> 00:55:00.575
I thought I was going to
have to get an abortion,


1058
00:55:00.618 --> 00:55:02.751
the way things were going.

1059
00:55:02.794 --> 00:55:04.753
But we can have this baby, can't we?

1060
00:55:04.796 --> 00:55:07.669
If we go to a regular town,
clean up and be good parents?


1061
00:55:07.712 --> 00:55:08.800
Everything changes.

1062
00:55:08.844 --> 00:55:12.587
As of today, I won't fail you again.

1063
00:55:28.646 --> 00:55:30.082
Morning, Lenny!

1064
00:55:31.388 --> 00:55:33.651
Morning, Mary.

1065
00:55:33.695 --> 00:55:34.783
Looks like a good one, huh?

1066
00:55:34.826 --> 00:55:35.826
Yeah.

1067
00:55:41.703 --> 00:55:43.869
We were the first store in
California to stock that board.


1068
00:55:43.879 --> 00:55:45.924
- Really?
- Yeah, 4-ounce glass.


1069
00:55:45.968 --> 00:55:47.970
Light as a feather.
Feel it.


1070
00:55:48.013 --> 00:55:50.625
That goes through waves
like it's got a mind of its own.


1071
00:55:50.668 --> 00:55:52.801
State-of-the-art, kid.

1072
00:55:52.844 --> 00:55:54.368
This is one bad fucking rail, huh?

1073
00:55:54.411 --> 00:55:55.978
The baddest.

1074
00:55:57.371 --> 00:56:00.678
- You buying?
- You finance?


1075
00:56:00.722 --> 00:56:03.812
"'I made a mistake when I
left my wife, ' he told a pal.


1076
00:56:03.855 --> 00:56:06.815
'I wanted the good life.
I thought that meant


1077
00:56:06.858 --> 00:56:08.556
wild parties
and fancy living.'"


1078
00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:11.036
You mean it doesn't?

1079
00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.170
Did you ever go to any movie
star parties when you were in LA?


1080
00:56:14.213 --> 00:56:15.640
No, we traveled in different circles.

1081
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:17.173
Had some wild times, huh?

1082
00:56:17.216 --> 00:56:19.871
- Not like here.
- Yeah.


1083
00:56:19.915 --> 00:56:21.177
What kind of job did you have?

1084
00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.396
Oh, I didn't work.

1085
00:56:22.439 --> 00:56:24.180
What did you do?

1086
00:56:24.223 --> 00:56:26.574
I...

1087
00:56:26.617 --> 00:56:27.705
I took dancing lessons.

1088
00:56:30.882 --> 00:56:32.449
Shitfire, we're gonna be late.

1089
00:56:36.148 --> 00:56:37.933
Hurry up, Linda!

1090
00:56:40.675 --> 00:56:43.112
- Oh, man.
- It's great, huh?


1091
00:56:43.155 --> 00:56:45.114
Yeah, it's great.

1092
00:56:45.157 --> 00:56:47.595
You know, I told Mr. Hendricks
you'd be hard to replace.


1093
00:56:47.638 --> 00:56:48.900
Why Australia?

1094
00:56:48.944 --> 00:56:51.338
They got really good beer there.

1095
00:56:51.381 --> 00:56:52.948
I ought to keep moving.

1096
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:55.342
I know you got to work to live,

1097
00:56:55.385 --> 00:56:57.344
but if you play it right,
you can work a lot less


1098
00:56:57.387 --> 00:56:59.128
and live a lot more.

1099
00:56:59.171 --> 00:57:01.130
Besides, chicks dig my accent.

1100
00:57:04.176 --> 00:57:06.135
Ah, how did you get
to be so smart so soon, Tim?


1101
00:57:07.919 --> 00:57:09.704
No, thanks.

1102
00:57:09.747 --> 00:57:11.836
I'm sorry, I forgot, you
don't ever touch the stuff.


1103
00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.925
Never.

1104
00:57:13.969 --> 00:57:15.666
Does Linda?
How's she doing?


1105
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:17.233
She's doing great.

1106
00:57:17.276 --> 00:57:19.627
It was my problem. She
got into it because of me.


1107
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:21.280
So I go to the meetings.

1108
00:57:21.324 --> 00:57:22.924
They help me, I help her. 
It all works out.

1109
00:57:22.934 --> 00:57:24.719
I got a going-away present for you.

1110
00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:27.407
- Here, buddy.
- You're kidding!


1111
00:57:27.417 --> 00:57:29.376
No.
You sell them so well,


1112
00:57:29.419 --> 00:57:31.595
I figured it's time you
learned how to ride one.


1113
00:57:33.989 --> 00:57:35.033
What's the problem?

1114
00:57:35.077 --> 00:57:36.470
No, with the exception of my wife,

1115
00:57:36.513 --> 00:57:38.385
I don't think anyone ever gave me anything

1116
00:57:38.428 --> 00:57:40.648
without working an angle for themselves.

1117
00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:42.301
Thanks, Tim.
I'm going to treasure this.


1118
00:57:42.345 --> 00:57:43.520
Sure.

1119
00:57:47.481 --> 00:57:49.004
I gotta go.

1120
00:57:49.047 --> 00:57:50.962
I'll send you a postcard from Down Under.

1121
00:57:51.006 --> 00:57:53.166
When I'm back this way,
we'll ride some waves together.


1122
00:57:55.793 --> 00:57:56.707
Take it easy, Lenny.

1123
00:57:56.751 --> 00:57:58.709
Thanks, Tim.

1124
00:57:58.753 --> 00:58:00.102
Hey.

1125
00:58:03.497 --> 00:58:04.933
Hey.

1126
00:58:06.456 --> 00:58:07.718
Look at this.

1127
00:58:07.762 --> 00:58:08.980
You going to surf?

1128
00:58:09.024 --> 00:58:11.461
Tim gave it
to me! Hi!


1129
00:58:16.205 --> 00:58:18.337
Delores has a boyfriend.

1130
00:58:18.381 --> 00:58:19.774
What?

1131
00:58:19.817 --> 00:58:21.950
His name is Richard.

1132
00:58:23.604 --> 00:58:26.737
He has a brother who lives in Sequoia.

1133
00:58:26.781 --> 00:58:29.261
Yeah? Where's that?

1134
00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:32.569
Like, every couple of weeks,
he drives a pickup truck


1135
00:58:32.613 --> 00:58:35.790
in the window of his brother's house.

1136
00:58:35.833 --> 00:58:39.707
Dolores says it's because he's
always fucked up on Maui Wowie.


1137
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:42.536
We talk about it all the time.

1138
00:58:42.579 --> 00:58:45.190
Sweetheart, would you like
to go out tonight, instead?


1139
00:58:45.234 --> 00:58:47.062
Yeah.

1140
00:58:47.105 --> 00:58:49.368
I'd like to go
to that little Italian place

1141
00:58:49.412 --> 00:58:51.849
near 2nd Avenue on 72nd Street.

1142
00:58:51.893 --> 00:58:53.938
God, you're homesick.

1143
00:58:53.982 --> 00:58:55.766
I'm not complaining.

1144
00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.987
I didn't realize.

1145
00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:00.858
I thought it was perfect here.

1146
00:59:00.902 --> 00:59:02.817
It is.
It's perfect.


1147
00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:05.776
If we go back to New York,
it'll be the rat race all over again.


1148
00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:07.604
I might just as
well go back to LA.

1149
00:59:09.867 --> 00:59:11.260
I just miss...

1150
00:59:12.522 --> 00:59:14.524
I don't know what I miss.

1151
00:59:14.568 --> 00:59:16.352
Just...

1152
00:59:16.395 --> 00:59:17.875
Interesting people.

1153
00:59:19.094 --> 00:59:20.443
Dancing.

1154
00:59:22.793 --> 00:59:24.665
At least we had friends.

1155
00:59:26.144 --> 00:59:28.059
It's all a smoke screen, right?

1156
00:59:28.103 --> 00:59:30.627
Come on, you're up there building
some huge-ass development


1157
00:59:30.671 --> 00:59:32.020
with Aetna or somebody, right?

1158
00:59:32.063 --> 00:59:33.369
Like a new city or something?

1159
00:59:33.412 --> 00:59:35.414
Joel, I manage
a small sporting goods store.


1160
00:59:35.458 --> 00:59:37.547
I make $400 a week,
and I work hard for it.

1161
00:59:37.591 --> 00:59:40.028
Don't kid me, slick.
I'm going to grab Rochelle


1162
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:42.204
and come up and check you out.

1163
00:59:42.247 --> 00:59:44.815
Any time. I gotta book you a
room at the Howard Johnson's.


1164
00:59:44.859 --> 00:59:46.817
All we got is
a small one-bedroom apartment.


1165
00:59:46.861 --> 00:59:49.298
Ha ha ha. You're an
original, kid. I'll give you that.


1166
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:51.648
Take it easy, Joel.
Give my love to Rochelle.


1167
00:59:51.692 --> 00:59:54.303
Hey, give it yourself. We're
on our way. Adios, amigo.


1168
01:00:06.315 --> 01:00:09.579
I didn't know he'd invite himself up.

1169
01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:16.455
Well, you know Joel.

1170
01:00:17.674 --> 01:00:19.546
Odds are he'll never make it.

1171
01:00:36.127 --> 01:00:37.825
The way you make your money is,

1172
01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:39.609
you go short against the soybean

1173
01:00:39.653 --> 01:00:41.306
but long on the soybean oil,

1174
01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:43.091
or maybe it's the other way around.

1175
01:00:43.134 --> 01:00:46.224
Anyway, it's called a
"straddle." Protects the downside.


1176
01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.487
Uh, hey, listen, 
I'll catch you later, Ron.

1177
01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:51.012
Wait, wait. Don't lose
the pulse rate, man.


1178
01:00:58.149 --> 01:00:59.977
A little TLC, He'll
be as good as new.

1179
01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:02.013
Doc, do you know anybody
who might want a dog like this?


1180
01:01:02.023 --> 01:01:03.275
I can't have a dog in my apartment.

1181
01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.503
Not offhand.

1182
01:01:04.547 --> 01:01:06.375
You could put a
note on my bulletin board.

1183
01:01:06.418 --> 01:01:08.420
Maybe just for tonight
or for a few days

1184
01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:11.144
You might know somebody who
could just keep him just a little while,


1185
01:01:11.162 --> 01:01:12.686
just so he's nice and taken care of?

1186
01:01:26.177 --> 01:01:28.179
Hey, I don't believe it!

1187
01:01:28.223 --> 01:01:29.572
You got knocked up!

1188
01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:33.663
It agrees with you. You're
more beautiful than ever.


1189
01:01:33.707 --> 01:01:35.012
Lenny's not back yet.

1190
01:01:37.188 --> 01:01:39.147
Same old Lenny.
Too busy to stop.


1191
01:01:41.758 --> 01:01:46.110
And that's Baxter and Miss Porter.

1192
01:01:46.154 --> 01:01:49.940
And this guy's Milton McNeil.

1193
01:01:49.984 --> 01:01:52.334
Once they've all had
a good sniff of each other,


1194
01:01:52.377 --> 01:01:54.771
you'll see they'll get along
famously with your poor friend.


1195
01:01:54.815 --> 01:01:56.164
Yeah. Hello.

1196
01:01:58.993 --> 01:02:02.561
Okay, but only one line,
because of the baby.


1197
01:02:02.605 --> 01:02:04.771
This late in pregnancy, coke
doesn't make any difference.


1198
01:02:04.781 --> 01:02:06.217
Who told you that?

1199
01:02:06.261 --> 01:02:07.828
A mother of three!

1200
01:02:10.265 --> 01:02:12.702
I've been real, real good in Santa Cruz.

1201
01:02:12.746 --> 01:02:15.009
"Here lies Linda Brown.
She was real, real good."


1202
01:02:15.052 --> 01:02:17.402
Not even wine or coffee.

1203
01:02:17.446 --> 01:02:20.492
Oh, well, you can be our designated drag.

1204
01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.289
There. You happy?
You happy now?


1205
01:02:35.507 --> 01:02:37.205
Seems like old times.

1206
01:02:37.248 --> 01:02:39.337
Was I out of line?
I apologize.


1207
01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.905
Shut up! Both of you.

1208
01:02:43.298 --> 01:02:44.778
I'm sorry.
I better get going.


1209
01:02:44.821 --> 01:02:46.701
Listen, in the next few days,
I'll find somebody


1210
01:02:46.736 --> 01:02:48.042
to take care of this little guy.

1211
01:02:48.085 --> 01:02:51.262
Want to talk about it?
I'm a super listener.


1212
01:02:51.306 --> 01:02:53.525
Mini crisis. If we get
through tonight, we'll be okay.


1213
01:02:56.093 --> 01:02:58.008
Oh, God, I can't believe I'm doing this.

1214
01:02:58.052 --> 01:03:00.358
I am such a dirty girl.

1215
01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:02.534
Such a naughty girl.

1216
01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:04.841
Good, clean fun.
Even Rochelle's being nice.


1217
01:03:07.975 --> 01:03:12.109
Dolores and her Maui Wowie
boyfriend, and Helen and her...


1218
01:03:12.153 --> 01:03:14.721
Joel, now what about
your cock? Is it big?


1219
01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:18.289
Whip it out!

1220
01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:20.291
Linda, I'm offended.

1221
01:03:20.335 --> 01:03:23.512
I don't like this. Lenny's
going to be incredibly pissed.


1222
01:03:23.555 --> 01:03:25.069
Let's close the store and get some air.

1223
01:03:25.079 --> 01:03:26.839
There's a beach
around here somewhere, right?


1224
01:03:28.865 --> 01:03:31.259
This is really great.
This is really living.


1225
01:03:32.347 --> 01:03:34.175
Smell that air.

1226
01:03:34.218 --> 01:03:35.872
We can go down to the beach.

1227
01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:36.873
Super!
How do we get down?


1228
01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:38.266
From a duck's ass.

1229
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:40.224
That's a joke, right?

1230
01:03:40.268 --> 01:03:43.401
There's a little stairway that
the surfers made. I'll show you.


1231
01:03:47.275 --> 01:03:48.711
Here it is.

1232
01:03:48.755 --> 01:03:50.659
This is like an adventure,
like when I was a kid.


1233
01:03:50.669 --> 01:03:51.670
Lenny and I...

1234
01:03:53.237 --> 01:03:56.066
- Linda!
- Oh, God.


1235
01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:58.590
She's okay, right?

1236
01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:01.463
She's okay, right? Talk to
me, Rochelle! Is she okay?


1237
01:04:01.506 --> 01:04:03.411
She just tripped, right?
God damn it! She's okay?


1238
01:04:03.421 --> 01:04:05.859
She's okay, right?
She's going to live, right?


1239
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:13.040
Is she okay? God damn
it, Rochelle! Is she all right?


1240
01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.302
She just tripped!

1241
01:04:26.531 --> 01:04:28.577
Hey, pal. Look, Lenny,
I don't care what they say.


1242
01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:30.579
It wasn't the coke!
It was only an accident!


1243
01:04:30.622 --> 01:04:33.538
- I'll kill you!
- It was only an accident!


1244
01:04:33.582 --> 01:04:35.802
Kill you!
Fucking kill you!


1245
01:04:39.631 --> 01:04:43.070
- I'll kill you! Get off of me!
- Lenny!


1246
01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:45.072
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

1247
01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:46.725
Okay, okay.

1248
01:04:46.769 --> 01:04:48.902
Where is she?

1249
01:04:48.945 --> 01:04:51.165
Where is she?

1250
01:04:51.208 --> 01:04:52.906
Where is she?

1251
01:05:29.246 --> 01:05:32.293
It happened, but I love you.

1252
01:05:34.948 --> 01:05:36.819
I'll always love you.

1253
01:05:39.039 --> 01:05:40.605
We'll be together,

1254
01:05:40.649 --> 01:05:42.781
and later, when it's all
better, we'll have an...


1255
01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:46.698
Another baby.

1256
01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:49.788
We weren't ready.
We were fooling ourselves.


1257
01:05:49.832 --> 01:05:51.399
And...

1258
01:05:53.488 --> 01:05:55.533
And I should've seen it coming.

1259
01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:57.187
I mean...

1260
01:05:57.231 --> 01:05:59.276
Anything, Linda.

1261
01:06:01.322 --> 01:06:03.411
You and me, together.

1262
01:06:28.958 --> 01:06:31.613
Hey, Mr. Brown.

1263
01:06:31.656 --> 01:06:33.416
You're up pretty late.
What can I do for you?


1264
01:06:35.356 --> 01:06:37.924
Joe, I hear you deal.

1265
01:06:37.967 --> 01:06:39.099
I need some downers.

1266
01:06:40.404 --> 01:06:42.493
I got some ludes.

1267
01:06:42.537 --> 01:06:45.061
Real ones.
Send you away.


1268
01:06:45.105 --> 01:06:47.455
That's where I want to go.

1269
01:07:28.365 --> 01:07:31.107
- How much?
- -$350 a month, or $100 a week.


1270
01:07:31.151 --> 01:07:33.892
In advance. Fall three
days behind, you're out.


1271
01:07:37.592 --> 01:07:40.116
- What about a dog?
- What about a dog?


1272
01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.118
We have one.

1273
01:07:42.162 --> 01:07:44.903
A dog would be an improvement
over most of the people here.


1274
01:07:48.037 --> 01:07:49.212
We'll take it by the week.

1275
01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:08.405
We're home.

1276
01:08:27.163 --> 01:08:28.860
Linda.

1277
01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:34.083
I can offer you a permanent position.

1278
01:08:34.127 --> 01:08:37.608
Thank you, but my husband
doesn't want me working full-time.


1279
01:08:37.652 --> 01:08:40.481
Well, if you change your
mind, just let me know.


1280
01:08:40.524 --> 01:08:42.918
Thanks very much.

1281
01:08:42.961 --> 01:08:44.224
Bye, now.

1282
01:09:08.161 --> 01:09:09.423
Honey.

1283
01:09:09.466 --> 01:09:10.467
Uh.

1284
01:09:11.468 --> 01:09:13.862
Honey boy?

1285
01:09:26.527 --> 01:09:30.792
You think there's a way
left we can, you know...


1286
01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:32.881
still make a life for ourselves?

1287
01:09:35.057 --> 01:09:37.886
Is this what it's going
to be like from now on?


1288
01:09:37.929 --> 01:09:42.499
We gotta get off
these fucking downers, man.


1289
01:09:42.543 --> 01:09:45.502
I know.
How about today?


1290
01:09:52.727 --> 01:09:54.468
Absolutely.

1291
01:09:56.774 --> 01:10:00.778
All I need is a plan.
One decent maneuver.


1292
01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:02.022
It'll all come together again.

1293
01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.477
That...

1294
01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.261
I'll be in the big bucks.

1295
01:10:05.305 --> 01:10:07.872
That isn't what I meant.

1296
01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:09.836
It'll be like this all
happened to somebody else.


1297
01:10:12.094 --> 01:10:13.704
- Who is that?
- Mark.


1298
01:10:13.748 --> 01:10:15.228
Oh, it's Mark.

1299
01:10:15.271 --> 01:10:16.968
Mark, come in!

1300
01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:23.018
You ought to lock this door. This
isn't exactly a security building.


1301
01:10:23.061 --> 01:10:24.150
Hi, Linda.

1302
01:10:24.193 --> 01:10:25.499
Come on in.

1303
01:10:25.542 --> 01:10:27.675
Hi, Mark.

1304
01:10:27.718 --> 01:10:29.807
I got your ludes.

1305
01:10:31.983 --> 01:10:34.541
It's nice having me live only one floor
away, huh? You get speedy delivery.


1306
01:10:34.551 --> 01:10:36.684
They're the real McCoy.

1307
01:10:36.727 --> 01:10:38.816
It's $50, Lenny.

1308
01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.166
Yeah, honey?

1309
01:10:40.209 --> 01:10:41.950
The bank?

1310
01:10:41.993 --> 01:10:43.952
Hey, why don't you sub-contract for me?

1311
01:10:43.995 --> 01:10:45.519
You could make a profit for yourself

1312
01:10:45.562 --> 01:10:47.782
and, uh, have a little
spending money on the side.


1313
01:10:47.825 --> 01:10:49.784
I don't deal drugs.
I deal real estate.


1314
01:10:49.827 --> 01:10:52.090
Hey, hey, I don't deal drugs
either. I'm a screenwriter,


1315
01:10:52.134 --> 01:10:53.744
But until the ship comes in,

1316
01:10:53.788 --> 01:10:56.182
you got to cover the waterfront,
you know what I mean?


1317
01:10:56.225 --> 01:10:57.748
Here, Mark.

1318
01:11:00.621 --> 01:11:02.753
Well, I got to get goin', uh,

1319
01:11:02.797 --> 01:11:04.233
get upstairs,

1320
01:11:04.277 --> 01:11:06.931
dirty some typing paper.
Ciao.


1321
01:11:17.986 --> 01:11:20.206
They're the real thing.

1322
01:11:23.731 --> 01:11:25.776
That was 20...

1323
01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:29.476
Jesus, no, it was 25 years ago.

1324
01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:32.305
I was the top call girl in Vegas.

1325
01:11:32.348 --> 01:11:36.787
Back before I moved to this
burg and started dealing coke.


1326
01:11:36.831 --> 01:11:39.486
Had it all before I got busted.

1327
01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:41.488
Lost all my old customers.

1328
01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:44.969
The stars, the politicians,
all my connections.


1329
01:11:45.013 --> 01:11:47.798
...are incorporated
in this state.


1330
01:11:47.842 --> 01:11:49.147
What is Delaware?

1331
01:11:49.191 --> 01:11:50.584
You're right.

1332
01:11:50.627 --> 01:11:53.282
Hey, good one, bud.

1333
01:11:53.326 --> 01:11:55.110
Listen to this.
He has $12,000...


1334
01:11:55.153 --> 01:11:58.287
I know your hooter is
hollowed through, but...


1335
01:11:58.331 --> 01:12:00.420
I still recommend coke

1336
01:12:00.463 --> 01:12:02.847
Over all those downers Mark's been
feeding you. Those things are dangerous.


1337
01:12:02.857 --> 01:12:04.511
I'm going to knock off everything

1338
01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:07.165
once I put my plan into operation.

1339
01:12:07.209 --> 01:12:09.603
Stick with coke.
Don't mix your chemicals.


1340
01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.389
Could you get that for me, honey?

1341
01:12:13.433 --> 01:12:17.088
$72,000?
Jesus!


1342
01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:19.569
...$72,800. Join us next
time out. So long, everybody.


1343
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:22.529
Hey.

1344
01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:24.574
Lenny, I thought you might be here.

1345
01:12:24.618 --> 01:12:27.360
Hey, Linda.

1346
01:12:27.403 --> 01:12:30.928
Could I see you two guys, uh,
in private for a minute?


1347
01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:32.234
Sure.

1348
01:12:34.062 --> 01:12:36.847
Are you ready for this?
I sold my script!


1349
01:12:36.891 --> 01:12:38.066
You did?

1350
01:12:38.109 --> 01:12:39.633
Oh, Mark, that's great news!

1351
01:12:39.676 --> 01:12:41.635
$50,000!

1352
01:12:41.678 --> 01:12:44.072
$50,000?
That's a respectable score.


1353
01:12:44.115 --> 01:12:46.988
Yeah, all we got to do is
dot the I's and cross the T's.


1354
01:12:47.031 --> 01:12:48.816
I was wondering,
would you celebrate with me?


1355
01:12:48.859 --> 01:12:50.557
We'll go to Musso's, all on me.

1356
01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.124
I can't. I got some important
papers. I got a deal pending.


1357
01:12:53.168 --> 01:12:55.213
I don't want to celebrate
alone. It's my big day.


1358
01:12:55.257 --> 01:12:56.302
Lenny, could I go?

1359
01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.740
Yeah, sure, if you want to.

1360
01:12:59.783 --> 01:13:01.742
I'll only be a minute.

1361
01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:06.050
You sure you can't make it, Lenny?

1362
01:13:06.094 --> 01:13:08.836
I told you, I got business. I can't
just drop everything, all right?


1363
01:13:09.924 --> 01:13:11.099
Yeah, okay.

1364
01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:18.672
You know what I'm gonna do tomorrow?

1365
01:13:18.715 --> 01:13:21.762
Buy a car.
An Alfa Romeo.


1366
01:13:21.805 --> 01:13:23.372
Are you serious?

1367
01:13:23.416 --> 01:13:26.897
White exterior, red
interior, AM/FM, cassette.


1368
01:13:26.941 --> 01:13:28.551
Oh, that's wonderful.

1369
01:13:37.299 --> 01:13:38.474
Oh.

1370
01:13:38.518 --> 01:13:39.867
Now, isn't this better?

1371
01:13:41.434 --> 01:13:42.696
All right.

1372
01:13:42.739 --> 01:13:44.959
There's a good one.

1373
01:13:45.002 --> 01:13:47.657
I just need a little boost,
then it's back to work.


1374
01:13:47.701 --> 01:13:50.268
Yeah, I hear you, sweetie.

1375
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:00.190
Hi.

1376
01:14:05.414 --> 01:14:06.414
Long dinner, huh?

1377
01:14:07.155 --> 01:14:09.113
He's so excited.

1378
01:14:09.157 --> 01:14:11.192
I helped him make his acceptance
speech for the Academy Award.


1379
01:14:11.202 --> 01:14:12.465
So he's going to be rich, huh?

1380
01:14:12.508 --> 01:14:14.771
He hopes.

1381
01:14:14.815 --> 01:14:16.676
I brought you home half a steak
and fries. I thought you'd be hungry.


1382
01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:18.209
In a doggy bag?

1383
01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.342
You were invited.
You could have come, too.


1384
01:14:20.386 --> 01:14:21.725
You would've loved that, wouldn't you?

1385
01:14:21.735 --> 01:14:23.519
I wanted you to come!

1386
01:14:23.563 --> 01:14:24.694
So, did you fuck him?

1387
01:14:24.738 --> 01:14:26.043
Lenny, don't!

1388
01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:27.697
You fucked him for dinner

1389
01:14:27.741 --> 01:14:29.559
and then brought me
the leftovers in a doggy bag?


1390
01:14:29.569 --> 01:14:32.528
Stop it! What are you trying
to do, get even? For what?


1391
01:14:33.834 --> 01:14:35.139
- Linda! Linda!
- No! No!


1392
01:14:35.183 --> 01:14:37.011
I swear, I'm sorry!

1393
01:14:37.054 --> 01:14:38.708
Linda, I... I don't know
what happened.


1394
01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:42.320
Fucking coke! I was
freebasing with Barbara.


1395
01:14:42.364 --> 01:14:44.801
I had to get back to work.
I was so miserable!


1396
01:14:44.845 --> 01:14:46.325
I just wanted to make it right again,

1397
01:14:46.368 --> 01:14:48.675
make it like it
used to be. Linda!


1398
01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:51.025
I will never hit you again!
I didn't mean it!


1399
01:14:52.243 --> 01:14:53.723
Linda, I love you.

1400
01:14:55.377 --> 01:14:57.335
Linda!

1401
01:15:10.566 --> 01:15:12.525
I know you didn't mean it.

1402
01:15:15.571 --> 01:15:19.314
I love you more than...
I've ever loved anyone.


1403
01:15:19.357 --> 01:15:23.057
I feel the same way.
Don't you know that?


1404
01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.408
I'd never do anything to humiliate you.

1405
01:15:33.633 --> 01:15:36.984
I'm gonna make it right again.

1406
01:15:37.027 --> 01:15:39.813
Sweetheart, I really am
working on something this time.


1407
01:15:39.856 --> 01:15:42.511
I wasn't gonna surprise you.
I wanted to tell you.


1408
01:15:42.555 --> 01:15:44.774
Some big guys, really big guys,

1409
01:15:44.818 --> 01:15:47.124
Guys who think big,
you know, like I do,

1410
01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:49.508
big guys from New York, who want to
set up the right thing in California, right?


1411
01:15:49.518 --> 01:15:51.172
I found out from an old contact.

1412
01:15:51.215 --> 01:15:53.261
You don't know him,
but I'm telling the truth.


1413
01:15:53.304 --> 01:15:55.176
I did some research on these big guys.

1414
01:15:55.219 --> 01:15:57.004
It turns out they're
in bed with the Saudis.


1415
01:15:57.047 --> 01:15:59.083
They're buying up office
buildings, shopping centers.


1416
01:15:59.093 --> 01:16:01.356
You know, I start doing
my work, I start thinking, like,


1417
01:16:01.399 --> 01:16:03.184
"What's their
biggest problem?"


1418
01:16:03.227 --> 01:16:05.055
Looking for an angle,
then it comes to me.

1419
01:16:05.099 --> 01:16:06.709
A way to structure their deal

1420
01:16:06.753 --> 01:16:08.875
so it won't look like the Arabs
are buying up the country,


1421
01:16:08.885 --> 01:16:11.661
which is their biggest problem, yet making
sure they wind up holding the money bags.


1422
01:16:11.671 --> 01:16:14.141
So, here's my idea. I structure
this mess of little partnerships


1423
01:16:14.151 --> 01:16:17.503
in which the average American or mom
and pop are limited partners with the Saudis,


1424
01:16:17.546 --> 01:16:19.679
who put up huge hunks of money

1425
01:16:19.722 --> 01:16:22.725
so that mom and pop are at minimal
risk, and they look like the good guys,


1426
01:16:22.769 --> 01:16:25.413
sharing the opportunities of this
great land with Mr. and Mrs. America.


1427
01:16:25.423 --> 01:16:28.122
It's a great, great idea.

1428
01:16:28.165 --> 01:16:30.907
So I got a call
in to this main guy.

1429
01:16:30.951 --> 01:16:33.083
This is my big chance.

1430
01:16:33.127 --> 01:16:34.911
It's my second chance.

1431
01:16:36.565 --> 01:16:39.568
I'm just a little tense.

1432
01:16:39.612 --> 01:16:41.309
Sounds like a good idea, Lenny.

1433
01:16:41.352 --> 01:16:43.616
Oh, it's going to
put me on top again.

1434
01:16:55.628 --> 01:16:57.455
Come on, Tucker.

1435
01:16:57.499 --> 01:16:59.109
Come on, just do it, okay?

1436
01:16:59.153 --> 01:17:01.895
Good boy, come on.
Do it! Come on.


1437
01:17:01.938 --> 01:17:05.333
Come on!

1438
01:17:05.376 --> 01:17:08.075
Linda! The phone!
Come on. Come on!


1439
01:17:08.118 --> 01:17:11.208
Can't you hear
the phone? Linda!


1440
01:17:14.298 --> 01:17:17.301
Linda! Don't you hear
the phone? The phone!


1441
01:17:19.129 --> 01:17:21.915
Shh, shh.

1442
01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:25.179
Advantage Equities.
Good morning.


1443
01:17:25.222 --> 01:17:28.835
Mr. Brown?
Who may I say is calling?


1444
01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:30.358
One moment, please.

1445
01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.709
William McConnell.

1446
01:17:33.753 --> 01:17:34.841
This is it.

1447
01:17:40.934 --> 01:17:43.893
Morning.
Oh, Mr. McConnell.


1448
01:17:46.548 --> 01:17:48.202
I see.
What did you think?


1449
01:17:55.035 --> 01:17:57.037
Well, when you do come to town,

1450
01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.475
my wife and I would like to take
you and your associate, Mr. Zimmer,


1451
01:18:00.518 --> 01:18:03.217
to be our guests for dinner.

1452
01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.002
Uh, a week from tomorrow
would be fine, yeah.


1453
01:18:06.046 --> 01:18:09.223
Elizabeth, a week from
tomorrow, for four at Morton's.


1454
01:18:09.266 --> 01:18:11.660
It would be fine.
It'll be great.


1455
01:18:11.704 --> 01:18:14.228
Well, good, I'll look
forward to seeing you then.


1456
01:18:14.271 --> 01:18:16.926
Thank you,
Mr. McConnell. Billy.


1457
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:18.972
Great, okay, bye-bye.

1458
01:18:19.015 --> 01:18:21.191
They went for it! Yeah!

1459
01:18:21.235 --> 01:18:24.238
They're going to come out.

1460
01:18:24.281 --> 01:18:26.534
They'll drill me for some details,
then it's business! Oh, man!


1461
01:18:26.544 --> 01:18:28.416
How can we take
people like that to dinner?

1462
01:18:28.459 --> 01:18:30.679
Well, not out in the VW
for take-out chicken.


1463
01:18:30.723 --> 01:18:32.563
Don't you sweat it, baby.
That's my department.


1464
01:18:32.594 --> 01:18:34.683
All you got to do is
be your beautiful self.


1465
01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:47.435
Roland!

1466
01:18:47.478 --> 01:18:49.219
Mr. Brown, how nice
to see you again.


1467
01:18:49.263 --> 01:18:51.439
How have you been? I need
something for tomorrow night.


1468
01:18:51.482 --> 01:18:53.126
It's important. I'd like
my old table if possible.


1469
01:18:53.136 --> 01:18:54.214
I think we could arrange that.

1470
01:18:54.224 --> 01:18:55.443
Could you write it down?

1471
01:18:55.486 --> 01:18:56.792
I want everything to be perfect.

1472
01:18:56.836 --> 01:18:57.750
8:00?

1473
01:18:57.793 --> 01:18:59.447
Right.

1474
01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:00.709
Oh, thank you very much.

1475
01:19:00.753 --> 01:19:01.971
Thank you.

1476
01:19:02.015 --> 01:19:04.495
We'll see you then.

1477
01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:07.237
Come on, Linda. What are
you trying to do, sabotage me?


1478
01:19:07.281 --> 01:19:08.369
I want to look pretty.

1479
01:19:08.412 --> 01:19:10.588
I'm trying to make a good impression.

1480
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:18.379
Should you be doing that?

1481
01:19:20.511 --> 01:19:23.036
I'm just honing the edge
a little. I'll be fine.


1482
01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.478
My God, you are a beautiful woman.

1483
01:19:30.521 --> 01:19:33.089
Too good for me. Always
were, and always will be.


1484
01:19:34.264 --> 01:19:36.049
Even if I owned the world.

1485
01:19:36.092 --> 01:19:37.441
I'll tell you a little secret.

1486
01:19:37.485 --> 01:19:39.042
I always needed you
more than you needed me.


1487
01:19:39.052 --> 01:19:40.706
Thank you for the lie.

1488
01:19:40.749 --> 01:19:41.707
I thought we were late.

1489
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:44.144
Let's go.
Let's rock 'n' roll.


1490
01:19:55.764 --> 01:19:57.374
Hey.

1491
01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:58.332
Good luck, you guys!

1492
01:19:58.375 --> 01:19:59.550
I'll take all I can get.

1493
01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:00.943
Linda, you look great!

1494
01:20:00.987 --> 01:20:02.292
Thanks, Mark.

1495
01:20:05.295 --> 01:20:06.732
When I sold my script,

1496
01:20:06.775 --> 01:20:08.777
I dropped a couple of ludes
before the meeting just


1497
01:20:08.821 --> 01:20:11.780
to show them I didn't rattle.
You got to look cool, man.


1498
01:20:11.824 --> 01:20:13.990
You got to give the impression
that nothing can touch you.


1499
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.871
Thanks anyway, but I don't rattle.

1500
01:20:23.705 --> 01:20:25.881
All the bad stuff that happened to us,

1501
01:20:25.925 --> 01:20:28.485
it's going to be like it happened
to somebody else after tonight.


1502
01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:42.071
Yes, sir.

1503
01:20:42.115 --> 01:20:44.421
Mrs. Brown, I heard your
husband was a very smart man,


1504
01:20:44.465 --> 01:20:46.597
but until meeting you,
I had no idea how smart.


1505
01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:48.904
Why, thank you,
Mr. McConnell.


1506
01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:51.907
You're a very lucky man, Lenny.

1507
01:20:51.951 --> 01:20:54.649
What can I say? I'd
rather be lucky than smart.


1508
01:20:56.042 --> 01:20:57.913
Yes, sir.

1509
01:21:10.186 --> 01:21:11.535
Good evening.
May I help you?


1510
01:21:11.579 --> 01:21:13.668
Yes, please.
Where's Roland?


1511
01:21:13.711 --> 01:21:16.845
Roland is out sick tonight.
May I help you?


1512
01:21:16.889 --> 01:21:19.369
Yeah, I'm sure he left instructions.
My name is Lenny Brown.


1513
01:21:19.413 --> 01:21:20.936
This way.

1514
01:21:24.679 --> 01:21:26.855
Oh, no no.

1515
01:21:26.899 --> 01:21:28.455
You made a reservation.
This way, please.


1516
01:21:28.465 --> 01:21:29.379
Thank you.

1517
01:21:29.423 --> 01:21:30.641
Here we go.

1518
01:21:35.603 --> 01:21:38.649
Sir? Sir?
Excuse me.


1519
01:21:42.218 --> 01:21:45.874
Excuse me.

1520
01:21:45.918 --> 01:21:48.659
Uh, is this one of Roland's little jokes?

1521
01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:50.357
He promised me my usual table.

1522
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.664
Your usual table?

1523
01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.710
This is where you stick the tourists.

1524
01:21:55.753 --> 01:21:57.668
Don't take me for some asshole!

1525
01:21:57.712 --> 01:21:58.974
Okay? Come on.

1526
01:21:59.018 --> 01:22:01.890
Sir, this is the only
table we have available.


1527
01:22:01.934 --> 01:22:04.675
Now, if you'd like to wait,
perhaps an hour?


1528
01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:09.506
No, this is fine. Thanks.

1529
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:10.551
Very good.

1530
01:22:18.602 --> 01:22:20.387
Well, here we are.

1531
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:21.649
Enjoy your evening.

1532
01:22:37.491 --> 01:22:40.668
I was a paralegal in
New York for 11 years.

1533
01:22:42.148 --> 01:22:43.671
We've ordered you a martini.

1534
01:22:43.714 --> 01:22:45.716
Fine.

1535
01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.894
I was telling your lovely wife
that I think your concept is brilliant.


1536
01:22:48.937 --> 01:22:51.113
Although I know your focus
was on Southern California,


1537
01:22:51.157 --> 01:22:55.683
I think there's no reason why something
like this couldn't be implemented nationwide.


1538
01:22:55.726 --> 01:22:56.989
Isn't that wonderful, Lenny?

1539
01:22:57.032 --> 01:23:00.035
- Uh-huh.
- Provided we can minimize the risk


1540
01:23:00.079 --> 01:23:02.733
to our Saudi friends, tax-wise, especially.

1541
01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:05.030
If you put enough lawyers in a
room with enough secretaries,


1542
01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.955
I'll come up with whatever you need.

1543
01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.046
To the project.

1544
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:12.091
Ah.

1545
01:23:29.891 --> 01:23:31.501
We haven't been back to New York

1546
01:23:31.545 --> 01:23:33.590
since we came out here.

1547
01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:36.071
Lenny's been so busy.
But we do miss it.


1548
01:23:36.115 --> 01:23:38.030
I suspect you'll be getting
back there shortly.


1549
01:23:38.073 --> 01:23:40.989
We have to find
a suitable place to celebrate.


1550
01:23:41.033 --> 01:23:42.991
Lenny, have you determined whether this is

1551
01:23:43.035 --> 01:23:44.514
a Section 355 transaction

1552
01:23:44.558 --> 01:23:45.994
under the new code?

1553
01:23:46.038 --> 01:23:48.997
What, they don't have any
lawyers left in New York?


1554
01:23:49.041 --> 01:23:51.130
Yes, indeed.
I happen to be one myself.


1555
01:23:53.045 --> 01:23:55.612
Mr. Zimmer, you're
asking Lenny about things


1556
01:23:55.656 --> 01:23:57.875
that should properly be a
part of the fine tuning. Why?


1557
01:23:57.919 --> 01:23:59.747
We know you're a smart guy.

1558
01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:02.010
We're talking about staking a lot of money

1559
01:24:02.054 --> 01:24:04.099
and our reputations on your husband's plan.

1560
01:24:04.143 --> 01:24:06.275
And everybody knows
Lenny's a smart guy, too,


1561
01:24:06.319 --> 01:24:08.582
- But he's had some problems.
- Mike.


1562
01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:11.280
I'm sorry, Lenny, Linda,
Mike's timing's a little off.


1563
01:24:11.324 --> 01:24:15.676
You want to blame me for an IRS upheaval that decimated
the tax-shelter business across the country? Fine.


1564
01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:18.026
Hey, I can take this plan to Genstar.

1565
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:20.115
Lenny, we love the idea
in its broad strokes,


1566
01:24:20.159 --> 01:24:23.065
but naturally, we did a quick background
check, and there were some rumors.


1567
01:24:23.075 --> 01:24:25.381
Now, when we all
get around the big table

1568
01:24:25.425 --> 01:24:28.080
and somebody waltzes in,
starts telling stories about you,


1569
01:24:28.123 --> 01:24:30.734
we'd like to be able to
tell him he's full of shit.


1570
01:24:30.778 --> 01:24:33.945
- Excuse me for...
- Let's not go back to your Arab friends who wipe their asses with their bare hands


1571
01:24:33.955 --> 01:24:36.044
and have them get the wrong idea!

1572
01:24:36.088 --> 01:24:38.863
You sit there on your fat MBA,
figuring out how to try to steal my idea


1573
01:24:38.873 --> 01:24:41.136
because maybe I won't fit
in your club of Arab fucks.


1574
01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:44.400
This isn't my goddamn table. This
is his first night. He'll be fired for this!


1575
01:24:44.444 --> 01:24:46.088
Lenny, what are you talking
about? The table's fine.


1576
01:24:46.098 --> 01:24:48.056
We're just here to
try to do some business.

1577
01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:50.092
You've been spending half
the night creaming over my wife


1578
01:24:50.102 --> 01:24:52.398
while this schmuck humiliates
me! I don't need you assholes!


1579
01:24:52.408 --> 01:24:54.019
I can get plenty
of action on this idea!

1580
01:24:54.062 --> 01:24:56.282
Check!
Get me out of this dump!


1581
01:24:56.325 --> 01:24:58.274
- Lenny isn't feeling well.
- They think I'm a junkie?


1582
01:24:58.284 --> 01:25:00.590
I'll act like a junkie for them!

1583
01:25:00.634 --> 01:25:03.854
Lenny, we may want to come back here!
Why don't you go home? We'll take a cab!


1584
01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:06.074
I'll drive you!
I'm your servant!


1585
01:25:06.118 --> 01:25:07.858
I'm supposed to be
nice to people like you!

1586
01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.817
His idea is good.
Don't hold this against...


1587
01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.210
God damn it, Linda, don't grovel!

1588
01:25:11.253 --> 01:25:13.081
My idea's going to be
on the cover of Fortune!


1589
01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:14.822
You know what these guys will be doing?

1590
01:25:14.865 --> 01:25:16.867
Carrying around some Arab's dick!

1591
01:25:20.871 --> 01:25:24.049
Linda! Linda!

1592
01:25:30.446 --> 01:25:32.579
Lackeys. Lackeys.

1593
01:25:32.622 --> 01:25:33.841
You had a deal made!

1594
01:25:36.278 --> 01:25:38.193
You could've been on your way.

1595
01:25:38.237 --> 01:25:40.677
You could have been on your
way to New York and something real


1596
01:25:40.717 --> 01:25:42.589
but you threw it down a rat hole

1597
01:25:42.632 --> 01:25:44.678
because you can't think
anymore! You can't feel!


1598
01:25:44.721 --> 01:25:46.462
My God, Lenny, you're so fucked up,

1599
01:25:46.506 --> 01:25:48.638
you don't even know
the disaster you've caused!


1600
01:25:48.682 --> 01:25:50.684
I am sorry I lost the baby,

1601
01:25:50.727 --> 01:25:53.643
but you can't punish me any more
than I've already punished myself!


1602
01:25:53.687 --> 01:25:55.940
- Oh, yeah? Shut up.
- For God's sakes! Let's call it even!


1603
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:58.648
I can't live like this anymore!

1604
01:25:58.692 --> 01:26:01.042
I'm going back to work full-time

1605
01:26:01.086 --> 01:26:03.131
and you are going back
into a rehab program!


1606
01:26:03.175 --> 01:26:05.002
I am not going
to watch you kill yourself

1607
01:26:05.046 --> 01:26:06.656
one minute longer!

1608
01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:10.443
Do you even hear me?

1609
01:26:10.486 --> 01:26:11.705
Goddamn cunt!

1610
01:26:13.446 --> 01:26:14.882
I'll kill you!

1611
01:26:33.727 --> 01:26:35.685
Listen, uh,

1612
01:26:35.729 --> 01:26:38.340
I'd like to put
a guard on your door.

1613
01:26:38.384 --> 01:26:40.037
No extra charge.

1614
01:26:41.517 --> 01:26:43.693
Okay?

1615
01:26:43.737 --> 01:26:45.695
Oh, God.

1616
01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:49.003
I promised him!

1617
01:26:49.046 --> 01:26:51.962
I promised him I'd be there!

1618
01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:54.182
Linda, I'm sure he made
a few promises to you, too.


1619
01:26:54.226 --> 01:26:57.272
But you don't want him around
right now. It's dangerous for you.


1620
01:26:57.316 --> 01:26:59.492
Are you listening to me?
It's dangerous.


1621
01:26:59.535 --> 01:27:01.276
It's not good for Lenny either.

1622
01:27:03.148 --> 01:27:06.238
If only we could
talk, like we used to.

1623
01:27:10.764 --> 01:27:13.854
I love him so much!

1624
01:27:14.985 --> 01:27:16.291
I know.

1625
01:27:16.335 --> 01:27:18.075
God, Lenny...

1626
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:25.692
Who are you?

1627
01:27:25.735 --> 01:27:26.900
- Lenny Brown! My wife's...
- Your lady's...


1628
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:28.216
I want to see her.

1629
01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:30.479
Please, Linda. Linda!

1630
01:27:33.787 --> 01:27:35.484
I'm so sorry!

1631
01:27:35.528 --> 01:27:36.964
Linda, I'm so sorry!

1632
01:27:37.007 --> 01:27:38.966
Linda! Linda!
Oh, please!


1633
01:27:42.578 --> 01:27:44.232
Who's the guy?

1634
01:27:45.842 --> 01:27:49.281
Svengali, yeah.

1635
01:27:49.324 --> 01:27:50.760
Svengali.

1636
01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:54.276
From day one, this airy-fairy doctor

1637
01:27:54.286 --> 01:27:56.679
had this Svengali control over her.

1638
01:27:58.290 --> 01:28:01.815
Kept me away, got her
to move in with him.

1639
01:28:02.859 --> 01:28:04.600
But you know what?

1640
01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:10.258
She still loves me.

1641
01:28:10.302 --> 01:28:13.957
She calls me up on the phone,
asks me how I am,


1642
01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:18.005
says to me, "Lenny,"

1643
01:28:18.048 --> 01:28:19.833
in that way she used to.

1644
01:28:22.314 --> 01:28:25.099
I beg her to come back,
but she says she can't.


1645
01:28:26.666 --> 01:28:28.798
It's the doctor.

1646
01:28:30.322 --> 01:28:35.022
He's got this hold on her, like Svengali.

1647
01:28:36.589 --> 01:28:38.852
But Lenny Brown does not give up.

1648
01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:44.074
One good maneuver, and
Lenny Brown is back in business.


1649
01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:47.034
Clean up,

1650
01:28:47.077 --> 01:28:48.644
buy a house on the hill with cash,

1651
01:28:48.688 --> 01:28:50.646
get some decent wheels
and get my girl back.


1652
01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:52.605
It'll be like...

1653
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:55.912
it all happened to somebody else.

1654
01:28:59.699 --> 01:29:02.049
I don't know.

1655
01:29:02.092 --> 01:29:03.920
A couple of years ago, I never even

1656
01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:06.183
thought about tables at Morton's.

1657
01:29:08.098 --> 01:29:10.884
And then I lose my prospects,

1658
01:29:10.927 --> 01:29:13.669
My girl... My wife,

1659
01:29:13.713 --> 01:29:15.845
and God knows what

1660
01:29:15.889 --> 01:29:17.064
all because I went crazy

1661
01:29:17.107 --> 01:29:18.935
because I didn't get the right table.

1662
01:29:21.198 --> 01:29:22.320
Now what the hell does it mean

1663
01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:23.850
when you lose everything over nothing?

1664
01:29:24.898 --> 01:29:26.421
I don't know, Lenny.

1665
01:29:29.468 --> 01:29:31.600
I got to get some capital together.

1666
01:29:31.644 --> 01:29:33.123
It takes money to make money.

1667
01:29:35.691 --> 01:29:40.130
Which is why I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave now, Ned. I got a customer coming.


1668
01:29:40.174 --> 01:29:42.350
Is there anything I can do for you?

1669
01:29:49.488 --> 01:29:51.968
Can you bring Linda back?

1670
01:29:54.188 --> 01:29:56.625
Just kidding.

1671
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:58.932
Oh, Jesus.

1672
01:29:58.975 --> 01:30:01.935
It's so nice to see a face
from the old days, Ned.


1673
01:30:04.154 --> 01:30:06.374
I won't lie to you. It's been
kinda hard to concentrate


1674
01:30:06.418 --> 01:30:08.202
because I kind of miss having her around.

1675
01:30:09.986 --> 01:30:13.207
I keep turning to her,
you know, to say things...


1676
01:30:16.906 --> 01:30:18.386
and she's not there.

1677
01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:21.476
I'm sorry.

1678
01:30:23.173 --> 01:30:24.958
Yeah, well...

1679
01:30:26.394 --> 01:30:30.180
I knew from the
first time I saw her...

1680
01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:32.922
that if I could ever have her,
I could never keep her.


1681
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:41.148
I always knew...

1682
01:30:44.412 --> 01:30:46.414
that I would lose her.

1683
01:30:48.198 --> 01:30:50.375
And I was right, wasn't I?

1684
01:30:52.986 --> 01:30:54.944
- Goodbye, Lenny.
- Hey, Ned.


1685
01:30:57.338 --> 01:31:00.428
Why the long face?

1686
01:31:00.472 --> 01:31:03.083
Now that you're writing for the
Times, we'll run into each other.


1687
01:31:04.214 --> 01:31:06.216
LA is a small town.

1688
01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:39.119
Stick with me,

1689
01:31:39.162 --> 01:31:40.947
please.

1690
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:42.818
Till I fall off the Earth.
