00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.090
Ahhh! Gahhhahaha!

3
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.790
<i>So...
where do you want to to begin?</i>


4
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.590
Where things always begin.

5
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.190
In bed.

6
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.890
<i>You never know
when you wake up</i>


7
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.790
<i>that this is the day your life
is going to change.</i>


8
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.490
<i>It started out just
like any other day.</i>


9
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.690
Hello?

10
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.190
Certainly, sir.

11
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.860
<i>(Alex, narrating) And here is
where the train started to go...</i>


12
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.860
<i>a little off track.</i>

13
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.940
I have had the unfortunate task

14
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.290
of eliminating several key staff.

15
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.390
<i>Since you are one of
last people hired</i>


16
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.390
I have no choice but
to start with <i>you.</i>


17
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.690
Now I know this is unexpected

18
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.990
but you are a very
capable, young woman


19
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.890
<i>and I am certain that
you will be able</i>


20
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.090
<i>to find something right away.</i>

21
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.590
So, if you wouldn't mind, I would
like you to empty out your desk


22
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.290
and vacate the premises immediately.
A security guard will show you out.


23
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.190
You're home early!

24
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.590
Finally, I get to
meet Tom's sister!


25
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.090
Oh God, I've been waiting for
so long to meet you. I'm Teena,


26
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.690
with a double "e".

<i>it's nose where it
doesn't belong, all right?</i>


29
00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.990
<i>But how this witness--</i>

30
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.790
<i>You have the right to
a presence of an attorney.</i>


31
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.790
<i>If you desire not to afford
an attorney,</i>


32
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.990

33
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.290
<i>...shot already,

34
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.290
<i>but I'm telling you,
that's the way it looks.</i>


35
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.190
<i>The phone didn't ring.</i>

36
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.690
<i>I got the house, the furniture...
his unpaid bills.</i>


37
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.190
<i>But Tom got all our friends.</i>

38
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.890
<i>So I did what any lonely girl
with no job and no man would do.</i>

Ahhhh!

68
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.790

Hi, I'm Nikki.

72
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.790
And I
-I don't use my words.

73
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.990
<i>(Alex, narrating)
It wasn't her fault.</i>


74
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.490
The guy would never take
his clothes out of the dryer.


75
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.890
I'm Marsha.
And I... treat my help badly.


76
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.190
<i>Once upon a time,
she'd been a Miss Tennessee.</i>


77

<i>But her ex husband
had just left her</i>


78
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.090
<i>for her younger version
of herself.</i>


79
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.690
<i>She took it out on her maid.</i>

80
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.590
Kim. Assault and battery
with a salad fork.


81
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.890
<i>Looking back, it's not so
hard to believe that</i>


82
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.990
<i>you put a bunch of angry, violent
women in the same room</i>


83
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.990
<i>something bad might happen.</i>

84
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.890
<i>Well, can I send you my resume?
And then if anything opens up, you can call me.</i>


85
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.790
Well, could I-
could I give you my name?


86
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.590
Take that!

87
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.190
Ha!

88
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.690
<i>Well that's a very
unique thing to share.</i>


89
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.890
I'm sure you'd made
your mother very happy


90
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.090
- and she must be very relieved.
- Thank you.


91
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.830
Alex, you've been awfully quiet.

92
00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.290
<i>Is there anything you'd like
to share with the group?</i>


93
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.190
No, I'm fine.

94
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.490
- Doesn't look like it.
- Yeah, I-I'm fine.


95
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.690
I mean, after all that I did for him,
I-I paid the bills


96
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.890
and I supported his
song writing career.


97
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.990
Putz.

98
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.690
Why are they always named Tina?

99
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.190
With a double "e".

100
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.090
Oh, do you mean her name
or her bra size?


101
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.390
You know, Alex, every relationship
requires <i>two</i> participants.


102
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.690
<i>So you were definitely
in this for a reason.</i>


103
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.590
Any thoughts on this, ladies?

104
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.190
- The classic fixer.
- Yeah.


105
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.090
- Classic.
- W-what does that mean?


106
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.290
Well, it means, uh, that
you like to fix people


107
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.290
and then it makes you feel needed.

108
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.590
I mean, it's not your fault,
you know. It's a sickness.


109
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.390
When Tom didn't need you any more,
it made you angry.


110
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.390
And you took it out on
the guy in the store.


111
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.790
Which is also totally
fine with me, I mean...


112
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.590
he sounded like an asshole.

113
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.290
All that trouble over
a synthetic blend.


114
00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.790
It was a very nice shirt.

115
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.290
Oh, well, I think we did really
great, great work today.


116
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.290
I'll see you next week.
Bye-bye now.


117
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.890
Hi! Alex!

118
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.590
Hey! Come join us.
Come on in.


119
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.490
This is the little Muhammad Ali.

120
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.490
- Welcome.
- You're way behind us. Ya gotta catch up.


121
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.690
They only want an hour.

122
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.990
- Alex, you have to show us.
- Okay. Okay.


123
00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.390
I was, like, "Don't push me around!
Shut up, jerk! Oh yeah?"


124
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.790
I'm taking this, okay?

125
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.690
Oh!

126
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.590
- Thanks.
- Oh my God!


127
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.790
Oh, excuse me.
Sorry.


128
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.590
Two beers.

129
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.390
Did I just imagine that?

130
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.590
Silent Revolution now.

131
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.090
<i>Silent Revolution.</i>

132
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.090
<i>That's the thing about loneliness.
It makes you overlook the obvious.</i>


133
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.490
<i>And honestly,
I liked these women.</i>


134
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.390
<i>They were a little nuts,
but are interested in me</i>


135
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.690
<i>and what I had to say.</i>

136
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.390
<i>So what happened next
didn't seem that strange.</i>


137
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.690
<i>I gotta go home.
I got work tomorrow. No, I do.</i>


138
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.790
I don't have to get up.
Accountant seeks work, film at 11.


139
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.090
Really?

140
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.390
<i>And then she offered me a job.</i>

141
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.280
<i>She owned an extermination business</i>

142
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.670
<i>and gotten herself in trouble with
the I.R.S. over some back taxes.</i>


143
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.890
- Hey!
- Hey, how's it going?


144
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:28.890
<i>Great.</i>

145
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.990
Well, the good news is that
I have it all figured out.


146
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.690
The bad news is it's
a pen, not a wand

147
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.090
and you <i>are</i> going to owe the government
<i>some</i> money for 2005 and 2006.


148
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.890
Ohh, really?

149
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.690
Aw, I got a kid in college.

150
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.490
The last thing I need
is some big, fat tax bill.


151
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.690
Can't we cheat?

152
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.590
No, I'm just jokin'.

153
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.790
Are you hungry? I made some lasagna.
Smell!


154
00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.890
I still cook for four, even though
all the kids are gone. I still do it.


155
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.190
I really do miss 'em.

156
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.690
- Do you cook?
- Well, that was Tom's department,


157
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.490
but, looking back, he really
didn't do much of that, either.


158
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.890
What <i>did</i> he do all day?

159
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.890
Oh. Yeah, I guess that
takes up a lot of time.


160
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.590
Did you really try to kill your
husband with your car?


161
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.590
Yeah... couple o' times.

162
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.690
But, see, my granddaddy, he started
this whole business.


163
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.090
And then <i>me</i> and <i>jackass</i>
were running it,


164
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.790
you know, together.

165
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:43.190
And then, when we decided to get divorced,
he tried to steal it from me, you know.


166
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.890
So I rammed him a couple times.

167
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.790
I don't know what the big deal is,
'cause, you know,


168
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.990
because when Kathy Bates does it
in <i>Fried Green Tomatoes,</i>


169
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.790
everyone claps and they cheer.

170
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.890
And then when I do it, it's like...
a felony, you know.


171
00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.690
So, the Judge decides
to take the whole business


172
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.790
and split it right down the middle.

173
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:08.190
Um, I have Travis and I have Hays,
and Bastrop. That's <i>my</i> section.


174
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.190
And he has Burnet and Blanco
and Llano.


175
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.490
And as long as I stayed
on my side, I'm fine.


176
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.990
Oh, shoot.

177
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.490
ABC Pest, big and small,
we get 'em all.


178
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.690
Oh.

179
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.590
Okay...
yeah, that would be great.


180
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:33.890
See you then.

181
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.490
I.R.S. guy on Friday.

182
00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.990
Can we, uh, get you anything?
Maybe some coffee?


183
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.290
No.

184
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.790
How about a big piece
of pecan pie?


185
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.790
No. Thank you.

186
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.390
Mr. Hutt, you know, I...

187
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.390
always wondered, you know,

188
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.790
how does someone choose
a career in the I.R.S.?


189
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.690
I mean, is it something
you've always wanted to do?


190
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.890
Sorry, Hutt, keep failing
you psych evaluation.


191
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.090
But I'm on new meds.

192
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.290
Yeah... no.

193
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.290
Yes.

194
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.490
Why don't you go file something?

195
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.790
Mm. Yeah, maybe I will.

196
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.690
Well, if you need anything
at all, just let me know.


197
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.690
Well... everything seems
to be in order.


198
00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.190
- You've done some good work here, Miss Case.
- Thank you.


199
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.690
Now, uh, we need to talk about
a payment schedule.


200
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.690
Right. Uh, my client was hoping
to make quarterly payments


201
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.690
spread out over...
sixty months.


202
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:34.090
Sixty months? Ooh!
Sixty months. Oh.


203
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:40.490
Sixty months. Sixty months would
be, uh, highly unusual.


204
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.490
But, uh, exceptions
could be made.


205
00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:50.990
Well, maybe we could, uh, talk about it,
you know, over dinner.


206
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.890
Oh! Um, I-I don't think
that's a good idea.


207
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.190
Are you sure?

208
00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.890
- Um, oops! I'm so sorry.
- Very hot.


209
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.490
Let me give you something, um...
Is that really hot?


210
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.590
- Yes.
- Oh, does it hurt?


211
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.490
Hey! Look what I just whipped up,
Want some fresh ham?


212
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.190
<i>You'll be hearing
from me, Ms. Agovino.</i>


213
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.790
<i>Drop by any time.</i>

214
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:27.940
What's going on with his pants?

215
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.490
He asked me out to dinner and
put his hand on my knee,


216
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.190
- and then I just threw coffee on his crotch.
- Oh.


217
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.390
It was great.

218
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.770
Dammit! I saw that stai
on his pants


219
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.090
and I-
- I thought you did me a favor.

220
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.590
<i>Oh well.</i>

221
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.490
Oh yeah.

222
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.890
That's neat.

223
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.290
I was a half an hour late.

224
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.290
He hit you with a closed fist?

225
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:27.490
Oh, so, if he hit her with an open fist,
he's a half way decent guy?


226
00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.490
- You have to leave him.
- I can't.


227
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.690
He said that if I ever leave him,
he'll find me and kill me.


228
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.090
Thank you.

229
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.090
My sweet, little beautiful. Mm...

230
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.190
Where the hell you been, baby?

231
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.000
Rick, please don't do this here.
All right?


232
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.590
I asked you a damn question.

233
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.690
But... I think I already
know the answer.


234
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.790
Being here with your little...
bitch brigade.


235
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.190
It's not like that, okay?
We're just-- we're just having a beer.


236
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.990
Trying to get laid?

237
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.040
No, we're just having a beer.

238
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.390
I'll tell you what, that's fixin'
to change tonight. C'mon. Let's go.


239
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.990
Rick, just stop it!

240
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.490
Stop, okay?

241
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.990
Come on, asshole!
Let's go! Huh?


242
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.990
I'll handle this.

243
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:55.190
- That's it.
- <i>Why you got two badasses in here?</i>


244
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.290
You got three seconds to get outta here
or you get the ugly stick.


245
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.290
Uh, you're the ugly stick.
I'll see you later, Gandit!


246
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:06.790
Okay?

247
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.390
You're not. Someone's got to
take you to the hospital.


248
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.090
- <i>You might want to go out the back door.</i>
- <i>Yeah, bring her out the back.</i>


249
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.990
I'll take you. I'm still on
the Board at Memorial.


250
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:16.890
- Oh shit!
- Want me to go?


251
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.890
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.


252
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.990
Will you call us and tell us
that she's okay?


253
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.390
I don't believe that just happened.
I <i>don't</i> believe it.


254
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.590
Come on, I gotta catch the bus,
they're gonna stop running soon.


255
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:30.890
We don't want him to come back.

256
00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.990
No, you know what?
I'm gonna give you a ride.


257
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.290
<i>Are you okay to drive?</i>

258
00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.590
Yeah, I'm a little drunk, but that was
so sobering, I can't even tell ya.


259
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.990
Do you want me to drive?

260
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.090
Yeah, if you drive,
then I can drink.


261
00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.190
That's so messed up.

262
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.190
<i>This car is as big as a boat.</i>

263
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.190
Mm. And with my car issues

264
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.590
we should be riding
in a monster truck.


265
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:58.090
Hey! Is that that guy?
That's Rick!


266
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.890
Oh my gosh, there he is.

267
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.790
Oh, that jerk.
You got to follow him.


268
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.890
- <i>Come on, you got to follow him!</i>
- Okay.


269
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.390
What? I just wanna see
where he's going.


270
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:18.590
Don't lose him.

271
00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.490
- You're gonna have to speed up.
- Okay, okay. Calm down.


272
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:26.890
- <i>You can't lose him!</i>
- Okay!


273
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.090
Ah, man. What an ass.

274
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.690
<i>He's the number one asshole.</i>

275
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.290
<i>And, look, we're right up
his crack.</i>


276
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.690
Hey, Stell, what happens when you go
in one of Trent's counties?


277
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.590
Oh, well, technically,
I could be arrested.


278
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.990
- This is crazy.
- No, this is fun!


279
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.390
This is like <i>Charlie's Angels.</i>

280
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.990
Mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But the original with Farrah.


281
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.690
Where is this bastard taking us?

282
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.690
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I said I'm fine!


283
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.090
You know, I just can't believe that some...
jerk like him, would-- would, I mean,


284
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.090
what kind of animal would
hit a girl like that?


285
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:29.190
- You said you were fine.
- I know.


286
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:33.490
But I lied.

287
00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.790
I thought you only hit your husband!

288
00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.290
Well--well, I'm expanding my operations.

289
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.390
Fuck you!

290
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.890
Where-
- Where'd he go?

291
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.490
Oh, oh, wait! Look out!

292
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.590
- Holy shit!
- <i>♪ ...we gonna have a good time... ♪</i>


293
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.490
Wow! Do you think he's dead?

294
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.690
Yeah, he's dead.

295
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.590
But... I didn't hit him <i>that</i> hard.
I'm going to jail.


296
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.390
No, I was the one
that was driving.


297
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.490
Yeah, but thy're never
going to believe that.


298
00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.590
I'm the one with the record
and the car.


299
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.190
Well-- well, should we
call the police?


300
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.890
Yeah, you do that,
we'll all really to jail.


301
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.290
It was an accident.

302
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.290
We're three drunk women
with assault records.


303
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.390
Shouldn't even be allowed out the
county for Christ's sake.


304
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.690
Cone on, let's get out of here.
Come on.


305
00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.690
What if the kids in
the pick-up truck saw us?


306
00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.090
No, no, no.
They would've stopped.


307
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.090
Look, I think it's just best
if we don't say anything, you know.


308
00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.290
Just get out of here.

309
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.090
No, I think <i>nothing</i> is suspicious.

310
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.990
You know, when I was in my dark place,
I watched a lot of <i>Law & Order</i>


311
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.290
and I realized that most
people get convicted


312
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:35.690
because someone confesses.

313
00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.290
So if we keep our mouths shut
then we have a chance.


314
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.590
- I--I don't want to go to jail.
- Me either.


315
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.790
<i>Yeah, it sucks.</i>

316
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:47.590
All right, well... good. Deal. Let's get
out of here. Then we won't say anything.


317
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.390
Okay, well, let's get
our story straight, okay?


318
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.990
So you dropped me off at 11,

319
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.290
I drove home, I read,
and I-I went to bed.


320
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:56.390
I
-I took the bus.

321
00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.190
No, don't take the bus
'cause the driver's gonna


322
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.390
remember someone who looks
like you at midnight, so...


323
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.590
so Stella dropped me off at 11
and then she took you home.


324
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.190
Okay.

325
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:06.790
All right. All right. Well, I...

326
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.790
I
-I gotta stop and get gas.

327
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.290
- Okay, just-- just don't stop anywhere.
- Why not?


328
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.380
Because gas stations have cameras

329
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.680
and then they'll know
what time you were there


330
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.190
and we don't want them to know.

331
00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.990
Wow, you are really smart.
How do you know this shit?


332
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.390
<i>Law & Order.</i>

333
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:24.390
I need another... drink.

334
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.990
<i>Rick was an accident.
We didn't mean it.</i>


335
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.990
<i>But what's done was done.</i>

336
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.990
<i>We-- we were better off
just keeping out mouths shut.</i>


337
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.990
Ohhhhhh!

338
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.490
- Stella.
- Yeah, I'm reading it right now.


339
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:54.890
And it says, "Probably due to a
dimly lit road." Yeah.


340
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.990
Alex, hold on on a second.

341
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.990
ABC Pest. Big or small,
we get 'em all.


342
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.490
Uh-huh, all right. All right.
Hold on, please.


343
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.490
- Hey, Gary?
- <i>Yeah?</i>


344
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.690
We got a lady with a possum in a pool.
Can you please deal with this?


345
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.590
- <i>Got it.</i>
- Thank you.


346
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.390
- <i>Anyway, I jus--</i>
- Come in!


347
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.890
<i>...it's just so weird
that they would print it.</i>


348
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.790
Alex? I'm gonna call you back.

349
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.190
Hey! What's up?

350
00:26:34.465 --> 00:26:37.490
I just came by to tell you
I'm leaving town for a while.


351
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.490
Awww! What a bummer.

352
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.390
Is-
- Is Rick okay with that?

353
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.890
Rick's dead.

354
00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.990
- Whaaat?
- There was a car accident...


355
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.990
The police said he must have been drunk
'cause the car went on off the cliff.


356
00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:04.590
Uh! Gosh, that's horrible!
I'm so sorry. God...


357
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.490
The police? Found him?

358
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.100
Yeah.

359
00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:17.090
They also said that some kids saw
an old blue car... parked nearby.


360
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.390
Wow.

361
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.790
Kids and... drugs...

362
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.390
Kids are so messed up nowadays.

363
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.490
Anyway, um...

364
00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:34.090
I wanted to give you this.

365
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.990
Yeah, I've been saving up
money for when I left him.


366
00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.390
I don't need it any more.

367
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.870
I--

368
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.990
- Kim, I-I don't know what's going on--
- Stella, just take the money.


369
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.990
Look, I-I told the cops that I was
hanging out with you guys at the bar


370
00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:01.190
before I went to the hospital, so...
they're probably gonna come here


371
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.090
and-and confirm my story.

372
00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:08.990
- Well, you know--
- You should- you should get yourself a new car.


373
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:10.390
Quick.

374
00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.490
Oh.

375
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.490
Well...

376
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.890
I
-I just want you to know

377
00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.890
that it's not like they way
they think it happened--


378
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.410
I don't wanna know.

379
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.490
Just... take it.

380
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.490
And thank you.

381
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.690
You're welcome?

382
00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.490
Alex? Call Nikki.
We got to meet.


383
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:31.490
Then, she hands me this.
$10,000 in a hundred dollar bills.


384
00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.790
That's $3,333.33 each.

385
00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.590
Look, we can't keep it.
We got to give it back.


386
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:43.290
No we don't. She wants us to have it.
It's like a gift, it's like a baby shower.


387
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.190
Yeah, a gift!
A very generous gift.


388
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.390
By accepting it, we acknowledge
that we did it.


389
00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.390
- Oh yeah. You know, that's not good.
- Uh, yeah, but except for we did it!


390
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.790
We didn't do it on purpose.
You-you have to give it back.


391
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:58.090
I can't, I don't-
I don't even know how to reach her.


392
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.590
Plus, she said she really
wanted us to have it.


393
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.390
Yeah, think about <i>her</i>, Alex.
It's not about you.


394
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.390
He was an asshole, anyway.
No one cares!


395
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.790
She's happy he's gone, you know?
Besides, uh, we really need the money.


396
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.290
Yeah, I know I do.

397
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.290
Okay, we keep it, but we
have to do it legally.


398
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.590
We enter it as a receivable
from a client.


399
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.890
And then we pay the taxes on it and then
we distribute it to ourselves as a salary.


400
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.790
You wanna give the government
some of that?


401
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.890
Well, Uncle Sam doesn't care <i>how</i> the pie
got baked, as long as <i>he</i> gets a piece.


402
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.090
You gotta be kidding me.

403
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.990
And, Stell, you gotta get rid
of that car today.


404
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.790
- Yeah, even Kim said that.
- <i>Law & Order.</i>


405
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:37.890
<i>Now we wait for the police.</i>

406
00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.890
Very nice.

407
00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:56.990
Okay, that's it, Jeffrey.
You can go now.


408
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:00.690
- Be sure you stay away from that candy.
- Thank you, Dr. McGuire.


409
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.390
See ya, kid.

410
00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:12.590
Excuse me.

411
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.190
Ahhhh!

412
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.990
I'm Detective Burke and
this is Detective Gardner.


413
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:48.090
Uh, were you working here
last Saturday night?


414
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.690
<i>Yeah, he came in and started
slapping her around,</i>


415
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.790
I showed him the ugly stick
and his way out the front door.


416
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:58.090
We went put for a few drinks, and then the asshole
shows up, he hits her and then they left.


417
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.190
- And that was about 11.
- What did you do then?


418
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.590
Stella dropped me off at the office,
and then I drove home and went to bed.


419
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:09.490
I, uh, I dropped the girls off
and then I drove home


420
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.190
and I had a snack and
then I went to bed.


421
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.390
I took a shower...
and went to bed.


422
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.940
What?

423
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.690
Alexandra Case?
Austin College, Class of '97?


424
00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:29.190
- Yeah, how do you know that?
- Class of '98.


425
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:30.890
Oh.

426
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.690
Nice to meet you, I guess.

427
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.490
I'm sorry, Detective,
but doctor-patient privilege


428
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.690
prevents me from discussing anything
that's talked about in therapy.


429
00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:44.290
Unless that person confesses their intention
to commit a felony such as murder.


430
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:48.490
I can assure you Kim Clark never
discussed killing her husband.


431
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.690
Our records indicate that Mrs. Clark
was in mandated therapy


432
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.890
for assaulting her husband
with a fork.


433
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.190
Do your records mention the events
that led up to that incident?


434
00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:02.490
I didn't think so.

435
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:07.190
Prior to her arrest, Mr. Clark had beaten
her over the head with a cell phone.


436
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.390
<i>He then threatened her
with a knife.</i>


437
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:13.490
So she defended herself with a fork,
stabbing him <i>once</i> in the chest.


438
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.790
And the Judge decided that is was <i>she</i>
that needed anger therapy.


439
00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.990
I think it's pretty ironic,
don't you?


440
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.810
Well, I think the bottom line here, ma'am,
is that a man is dead.


441
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:25.890
A very violent man who was a spousal abuser
and a chronic alcoholic.


442
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.690
So, you think it's okay
that he's dead?


443
00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.290
No, I'm just not surprised.

444
00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:36.390
<i>Rick's body had a
blood alcohol level of 2.0,</i>


445
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:37.790
<i>twice the legal limit.</i>

446
00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:42.390
<i>So everyone just thought he lost
control of his car. Case closed.</i>


447
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:46.390
<i>Hey, Alex, hurry up!
The session's about to begin.</i>


448
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:47.490
Coming!

449
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.190
<i>And that would have been the end of it...
if it weren't for Danielle.</i>


450
00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:57.940
So even though I'm surrounded by
my household staff... all day long


451
00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.990
I just... feel so alone.

452
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:05.790
Well, usually something triggers
these episodes of despair.


453
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:07.290
<i>What happened?</i>

454
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:10.990
Well, um, I was watching this movie

455
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:16.290
<i>and this man is in a hotel room and
wakes up with a hooker in his bed</i>


456
00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.190
and she's dead.

457
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:22.890
And he immediately gets on his phone
and calls ten friends.


458
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:28.490
<i>And... it just got me thinking</i>

459
00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:33.790
that if I woke up with
a dead hooker in my bed,


460
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.990
I wouldn't have anyone to call.

461
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.390
<i>Thank you for sharing, Marsha.</i>

462
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:48.090
Oh! Well, um, we're gonna
pick up next week on


463
00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:52.690
Marsha's feelings of alienation
and fears of abandonment.


464
00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:57.790
But, before we end the day, I'd like
to introduce a new member to our group.


465
00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.590
<i>Or better yet, why don't
you introduce yourself?</i>


466
00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.690
Thank you.

467
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:04.890
Hi, I'm Danielle.

468
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.590
Her husband was this hotshot lawyer
and he always cheated on her.


469
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.490
She said the final straw was when she
caught him with the Russian facialist


470
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.290
using the certificate that she
gave him for Christmas.


471
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:19.690
She was staring at me.
I mean, why was she staring at me?


472
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.590
<i>I know you guys always think
that I'm paranoid and stuff--</i>


473
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.190
- She knows.
- Yeah, see, I-- I dunno--


474
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:29.190
Hey! Hey! I wondered if I could
talk to you a sec.


475
00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.490
Sure. I mean, we're all friends here.

476
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:39.890
Listen, my friend Kim, she told me
I could talk to you about my problem.


477
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.990
To see if you could
take care of it.


478
00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:47.990
I'm sorry, but we can't help you.
Come on, guys.


479
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.490
You know, I can pay you.

480
00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.890
<i>Yeah, he has that
"home, a rich white guy" smirk.</i>


481
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.290
You guys, this is wrong. We shouldn't
even be talking about this.


482
00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:07.490
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right.


483
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.390
- Wha...?
- She's right.


484
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:13.890
What?
Fine.


485
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.990
- So you're gonna tell her?
- Oh, yeah, I'm gonna tell her.


486
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:21.490
I should have been suspicious.
They gave in way too easy.


487
00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.590
But I wanted to put it behind me

488
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:27.690
<i>because, suddenly, I had
other things to think about.</i>


489
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.790
Hey! Excuse me, but
the pumpkin pie is mine.


490
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.690
I don't see your name on it.

491
00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:00.790
Well, I-- I put it on the counter.
<i>Sir,</i> that pie is mine.


492
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.490
Is there a problem here?

493
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.090
Nope. No problem.

494
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.290
- Officer... Burns?
- Burke, Burke. Daniel Burke.


495
00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.690
You didn't have to do that.
I was resolving my conflict peacefully.


496
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.690
Oh, I'm sorry, I was just tryin' to help.
Uh, pumpkin's my favorite.


497
00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.190
Thank you.
Have a nice day.


498
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.390
Hey! Can I help you
with your stuff?


499
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:31.090
Oh, ah, it's okay, I'm fine.

500
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.640
Miss Case, I have a confession to make.

501
00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.390
I thought it was the criminals
that make the confessions.


502
00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.090
Yeah.

503
00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.190
Well, in this case,
it's the good guy.


504
00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.390
Um, well, you-- you wouldn't
know this, but


505
00:37:45.393 --> 00:37:49.490
in... in college I had a
terrible crush on you.


506
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:54.390
Well, since you have your dessert,
why don't you let me buy your dinner?


507
00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:00.890
Umm, I don't think that--
that's a good idea.


508
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.290
Oh, okay.

509
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.690
I mean, it's not for you,
you seem really nice... and cute.


510
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:10.390
Um, I jus-- I just got out of this
long thing with this big jerk, and


511
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:12.890
I just have, uh, a lot of issues.

512
00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:16.190
It's just dinner, um.

513
00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:18.890
It's never just dinner.

514
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:25.490
Hmm. Um.

515
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.690
- Are you married?
- No.


516
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.490
- Engaged?
- No.


517
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:33.590
Okay, I just want to be clear,
so there's no confusion later,


518
00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.090
is there anyone who would object
to you asking a single woman out


519
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.090
in the fruit and vegetable and pie
section of the supermarket?


520
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:43.090
Oh, you're-- you're
interrogating <i>me</i> now, that's--


521
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:45.990
Bad answer, but thanks for playing.

522
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.290
Wait, wait, I'm sorry, the...
the answer is no.


523
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.790
There's no one out there that
would be, um, angry


524
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.590
that I, uh, whatever--

525
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.790
whatever it was you said, no.
No.


526
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:04.990
So?

527
00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.790
Christ!

528
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:15.490
<i>This guy is such a tool.</i>

529
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.590
Okay, well, calm down,
we can figure this out.


530
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:20.490
No, I'm not gonna calm down!
He calls this a payment plan?


531
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:21.890
He's gonna put me out of business.

532
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.840
Well this makes no sense,
He wants everything in 90 days?


533
00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:26.990
I know, I mean, I don't have
that kind of money.


534
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:30.090
Gosh, why don't you go out
and have dinner with him?


535
00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.990
Or, or ss-- I wish you'd
slept with him.


536
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:35.990
Come on, be a whore for a friend.

537
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.390
I know, I know, but--

538
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.492
Shit!

539
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.090
Hey!

540
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.190
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?


541
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:45.860
I work here now.

542
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.500
The dentist fired me.

543
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.000
Accident with the drill.

544
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:54.490
He lived.

545
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:56.390
So you're an exterminator now?

546
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.390
God, no, I'd never kill an animal.

547
00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.490
She's just in here doing some stuff
for me around the office.


548
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.590
We're expanding.

549
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.690
Nikki, don't bore her with all this stuff.
I don't think we're gonna be expanding anyway


550
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:09.690
'cause that guy's taking
all my money.


551
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.090
So? How's your life going?

552
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:23.090
<i>Stella suggested an herbal seance
for full karmic cleansing.</i>


553
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.190
<i>Then Marsha got me an interview</i>

554
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.490
<i>at her cousin's husband's
accounting firm.</i>


555
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:36.010
<i>And my dinner date turned out to be
funny and charming and smart and</i>


556
00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.090
- he has a job.
- <i>Whooo!</i>


557
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:42.090
What does he do?

558
00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.090
He's, um, a--

559
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:48.190
<i>Since therapy is all
about being honest</i>


560
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.510
I really should have said,
"He's the detective who's investigating


561
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:53.290
the death of Kim's husband

562
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:57.990
which Stella, Nikki and I did by the way."
But, what I said was...


563
00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:59.290
Postman.

564
00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.490
A postman! Great!

565
00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:07.890
<i>I did feel guilty about lying, but
with my track record with decent men</i>


566
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.090
<i>I figured we'd be broken up
in a week, so, why bring it up?</i>


567
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.290
So when's your big date?

568
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:16.390
Oh, um, I wanted to talk to you
about that later.


569
00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:18.490
Just one more second!

570
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:21.490
Okay, so I preheated the oven.

571
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.090
No, the eggplant appetizer
needs to be served cold.


572
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.690
Yeah, definitely.
Yeah, it always tastes better.


573
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.790
But, the <i>chicken</i>, the chicken, you wanna take
a little bit of brown sugar and sprinkle it on 'im.


574
00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:37.100
And then, uh, then put it it the oven
for about 25 minutes at 350.


575
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:41.190
Yeah. No, he's gonna love it.
All men like that.


576
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:46.090
No, I'm proud of you.
I think you're doin' a good job.


577
00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:47.490
Psst!

578
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.740
Oh, yeah, and, uh... (No, bigger!)

579
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.890
I need, um, actually...

580
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:59.190
You know, I want to ask you, this
doesn't look like chicken parmesana.


581
00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:03.890
No, see, I didn't have mozzarella at all.
So, I made a baked chicken


582
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.290
with an onion <i>glazé.</i>

583
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.590
Yeah. And it worked.

584
00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:11.990
<i>Yup. Psst! Psst!</i>

585
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:13.790
(Tape.)

586
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:18.890
<i>I have total faith in you.</i>

587
00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:24.190
And I... absolutely.
No, I think you're doing great.


588
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:27.890
And, uh, I hope you got a centerpiece.
Two!


589
00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:31.490
<i>Well, I don't know, I like
green apples in a vase</i>


590
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.590
<i>and then just fill it with water.</i>

591
00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.890
Well, maybe, uh, next time.

592
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:40.890
Okay, I'm... done!
What are you guys doing tonight?


593
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:44.490
Nothing.
Now, on to the <i>Crème Brûlée.</i>


594
00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.890
They're so cute.

595
00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.190
So you keep the blowtorch on low.

596
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:57.890
And then what you do is, you just slowww-ly, slowly
fire it up so you don't burn the skin on top.


597
00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.790
Okay. Okay, blowtorch on low.

598
00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.090
And that's about it.

599
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:09.390
Ohhh! Look!

600
00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:11.290
Love that.

601
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.990
Thank you so much.
I'll call you tomorrow.


602
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:19.490
<i>This is just in to us. An attorney from
Houston has turned up dead in East Austin.</i>


603
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:23.690
<i>The body of private malpractice attorney
Steven Cantor was found lying in an alley</i>


604
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:27.090
<i>behind the night club Chaos
around 3 in the morning.</i>


605
00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:30.490
Sources tell us Cantor was bludgeoned
to death with a golf club.


606
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:34.090
<i>The police believe it was a robbery gone bad.
Cantor's wallet and watch are missing.</i>


607
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:36.990
Cantor's wife, Danielle, has been
unavailable for comment.


608
00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:39.490
<i>Word is that she was vacationing
in Aruba with sons Jer...</i>


609
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:43.090
- Something smells good.
- <i>...at the time of the attack...</i>


610
00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.490
<i>I told myself it was
all a coincidence.</i>


611
00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.590
<i>The papers said Cantor was
high on ecstasy and Viagra.</i>


612
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.790
<i>He was definitely out
looking for trouble.</i>


613
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:54.790
<i>Maybe... he found it.</i>

614
00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.590
<i>Either way, it was
none of my business.</i>


615
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.590
You are an amazing cook.

<i>Happy New Year!!</i>

626
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.490
<i>You know, my girdle is so tight,</i>

627
00:44:37.491 --> 00:44:39.490
<i>it's making me breathe differently.</i>

628
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:42.090
Hm. That's a bonus.

629
00:44:42.892 --> 00:44:43.900
Oh my God, it's Alex!

630
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:48.390
Hey, Alex! I'm gonna put you
on speaker phone.


631
00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:53.240
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- We're at the mall.


632
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:56.190
<i>Well, damn, I need some things
from there. Why didn't you tell me?</i>


633
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:59.490
Mm, it was a last minute thing, Al.
Sorry.


634
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.490
<i>What time you guys getting here?</i>

635
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:07.290
We'll be there soon, Alex. Real soon.
We just have one thing we have to do first.


636
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:14.090
- Alex, we gotta go.
- <i>Oh, wait! While you're there, can you--</i>


637
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.270
Ready?

638
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:18.780
Let's roll.

639
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.490
- <i>They came over?</i>
- Yes.


640
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:05.970
<i>You didn't notice the blood
on her shirt?</i>


641
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:07.590
She said it was ketchup.

642
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.660
<i>And you believed her?</i>

643
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.090
I'm not a suspicious person.

644
00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.690
But then there <i>was</i> Saint Patrick's Day.

645
00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:24.890
<i>We were all out celebrating early.</i>

646
00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:27.090
<i>You know, singing, drinking...</i>

647
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.490
...a transvestite where it's...
a guy going into a girl


648
00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:33.690
or it's a girl going in--
transgenderous thing but it's...


649
00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:36.490
You can- You can rent him for the evenin'.
He comes to your house


650
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:39.490
and he, uh, he gives you blowjob lessons.

651
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:41.690
No way.

652
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:43.790
And I thought it would be great
for a party, or, like, for--


653
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:48.190
we could- would could rent him for one of you.
Marsha, he certainly, well, probably needs help.


654
00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:51.790
Yeah... I'm Catholic.

655
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.490
I know, but guys won't pay
for something like that.


656
00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.290
Oh, niiice! Oh!

657
00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:02.590
- I mean, like, we'll make the investment.
- <i>Yeah, yup. That's true.</i>


658
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:04.790
I'm joking.

659
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:16.090
Oh my God, that guy
just <i>groped</i> me.


660
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.090
- What? Where?
- What do you mean?


661
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.890
- That guy over there.
- Which guy? <i>That</i> guy?


662
00:47:22.088 --> 00:47:23.290
<i>Look
-Look what he's doing.</i>

663
00:47:24.088 --> 00:47:25.490
You gotta to be kidding me.

664
00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:29.590
This is the best. I love it!
I'm sorry.


665
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:33.090
Why does he think it's okay
to get drunk and to do that?


666
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.990
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- It's not.


667
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.790
- Uh-oh. Here goes crazy.
- <i>Shut up.</i>


668
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:44.090
Dude, dude, dude, dude!
Come on. Come on!


669
00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:45.390
What's she gonna do?

670
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:47.390
I'm sorry, baby, hold on.

671
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:49.410
What's up, mama?

672
00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:53.890
Hmm. Thank you. Oh, you're so cute. Haha!
He's so cute!


673
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.580
<i>Marsha, where do we go to
hock our jewelry?</i>


674
00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:05.090
- Wow!
- Oh! I mean, just give me enough time...


675
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:07.690
Enough time and it's
gonna be real somethin'.


676
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.790
Yeah, well, it would be best
to use the state people.


677
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:14.890
It's like water in your hands.
They melt every mother fuckin' time.


678
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.090
<i>Babies, how beautiful. 
I love you.</i>

679
00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:24.590
- Thanks for the light, Hun.
- Oh, mama, you got it. Ohh! Baby Jesus!


680
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:26.990
<i>Play it cool.
Play it cool.</i>


681
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:29.290
- <i>Alright, you know what? Marsha, you--</i>
- I-I--


682
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:30.980
Oh my God, we have
to get out of here.

683
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.090
- Sit down! I'm gonna enjoy this.
- <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>


684
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:36.290
Hey, dude! Dude!
You're on fire!


685
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:39.390
Oh shit! I'm gonna miss it!

686
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:45.106
- It's getting good!
- <i>Call the fire department. Quick! Quick!</i>


687
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.093
<i>What a waste of beer!</i>

688
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:50.590
Silent Revolution, Al.

689
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:54.090
You know that guy could have
really been hurt?


690
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:57.090
So what?
He was an asshole.


691
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:02.090
You know, the city is full of assholes.
You can't go around setting them all on fire.


692
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:03.790
Why not?

693
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:12.190
Why not?

694
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:27.590
What?!

695
00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.090
<i>...asshole.</i>

696
00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:22.090
<i>You know, the city is full of assholes.
You can't go around setting them all on fire.</i>


697
00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.090
Why not?

698
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:29.090
Why not?

699
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:32.690
<i>...and there was six of us, all girls.
Hm! Poor father, God rest his soul.</i>


700
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.790
And, you know, he worked for the electric company
and my mom was a housewife


701
00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:38.890
and so we never had <i>any</i> money.
And I'm the fourth of six


702
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:41.390
so, forget about
having anything new.


703
00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.790
Which normally, you know,
doesn't really bother me, but...


704
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:50.490
This one time, this is one time, I saw
this dress in the window of Dress Barn


705
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.490
<i>and I wanted to wear it
to my Junior prom.</i>


706
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.290
<i>God, I begged my mother.</i>

707
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:57.090
God, I begged her.

708
00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:02.090
Mm. But... then my sister Mary Beth
goes and breaks her arm.


709
00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:05.790
So there goes the money for
the dress, you know.


710
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:10.200
<i>And I'm at school the next day,
bitchin' about Mary Beth and then</i>


711
00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.690
<i>Bo Turner tells me
he'll pay me fifty bucks</i>


712
00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.490
<i>if I have sex
with his older brother.</i>


713
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.890
<i>I mean,</i>

714
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.990
You'll pay me?

715
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:26.490
These days you might say...
Michael was, I dunno, "mentally challenged".


716
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:29.490
Back in the day, we just
called him a retard.


717
00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:33.090
<i>So I go over there after school
and I do it, no big deal</i>


718
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:37.090
<i>and I go find Bo to get my money.
And the loser refuses to pay me.</i>


719
00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.740
I mean, I didn't actually think
you'd go through with it.


720
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.390
<i>So I'm like, "You better pay me."
And he's like, "No, I didn't think you'd do it."</i>


721
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:46.030
<i>And I'm like,
"Well, I did it, so pay me."</i>


722
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:47.690
And then he's, like, "No."

723
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:52.090
<i>So finally, I tell him, "Pay me or I'm gonna
tell the Reverend and your mother</i>


724
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:54.090
<i>what you asked me to do."</i>
You better find it.


725
00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:55.590
<i>And he don't think
I'm gonna do it.</i>


726
00:52:55.590 --> 00:53:00.240
<i>And I'm like, look, I already had sex with him.
The worst part's over. Like, what do I have to lose?</i>


727
00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:05.390
He pays me the money, I go straight
to Dress Barn, I buy the dress


728
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:06.990
<i>and they vote me Prom Queen.</i>

729
00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.490
<i>Love that dress.</i>

730
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:12.890
<i>I still have it.</i>

731
00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:17.190
<i>So what about any of you?</i>

732
00:53:17.195 --> 00:53:19.982
Anyone else here ever
fuck a retard for a dress?


733
00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:25.990
Um... Once I let my husband

734
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:28.390
put his penis in my anus
for a Cartier necklace.


735
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:32.490
Does that count?

736
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:35.990
Yeah.

737
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:46.690
Hey, what are you doing home? I thought
Tuesday was your night out with the girls.


738
00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.990
- We had a fight.
- <i>About what?</i>


739
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:53.790
Nothing.

740
00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:56.990
You know, I'm sure it's gonna be fine.
Um, how's work?


741
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:58.590
- It's busy.
- <i>Oh really? Okay.</i>


742
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:03.590
- Dan, we gotta move.
- Al, I gotta go, I'll call you tomorrow, okay?


743
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.690
- <i>Love you. Bye.</i>
- Love you.


744
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:14.690
<i>You can't tell your cop boyfriend that</i>

745
00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:18.190
<i>your pals like to set
drunken frat boys on fire.</i>


746
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:58.590
- Oh, hey. Alex!
- Hey.


747
00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:00.090
Hey! What are you doing here?

748
00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:02.290
Oh, I just--
Is Nikki here?


749
00:55:03.590 --> 00:55:04.990
Yeah...

750
00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:06.390
Yeah.

751
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:07.890
Hey, Nikki!

752
00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:13.090
<i>How you doing in there?</i>

753
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:14.390
<i>Yeah?</i>

754
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.990
- Uh, guess what? Alex is here.
- <i>Huh?</i>


755
00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:20.390
- Alex.
- Hold on!


756
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:29.690
Why don't you... come on in?
Uh... Nikki's just, uh, finishing up some work.


757
00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.990
Cool. Thanks.

758
00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:35.690
- <i>Hey, Nikki!
- Here we are!</i>


759
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:39.100
Hey.

760
00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:41.690
Hey!

761
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:43.190
Cool outfit.

762
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.646
Thanks, thanks. Heh.

763
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:50.890
Look, um... I'm sorry about last week.
I think... I think I overreacted.


764
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:53.590
No, it-it wasn't your fault.

765
00:55:54.093 --> 00:55:55.290
I mean...

766
00:55:55.990 --> 00:56:01.690
It was me, you know. And then...
Still not- still not using my words, you know.


767
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.890
Forgive me.

768
00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:10.140
- Of course. I just... really missed you guys.
- <i>Aww! And we missed you!</i>


769
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:13.290
<i>We did.</i>

770
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.190
<i>Talk about perfect timing.</i>

771
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:16.290
- What?
- Yeah.


772
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:20.390
- Here, it says it's "Special Delivery"... from the postman.
- Thank you.


773
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:21.890
You guys are the best.

774
00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.690
Hi, is Detective Burke here?

775
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:36.390
Thank you.

776
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:52.590
<i>Uh, guys, let's take five.</i>

777
00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:07.940
<i>Get in here.</i>

778
00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:11.190
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- Don't worry about it, they're just jealous.


779
00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:14.590
Wow, what is <i>that</i>?

780
00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.575
Ah, city homicides.

781
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:21.690
Are all these pins dead people?

782
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:24.890
Ah, yeah, specifically males,
twenty-five to fifty-five..


783
00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:27.790
Oh, and what are the different colors?

784
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:34.890
Well. The red are violent crimes. You know,
stabbings, shootings, fires, that kind of thing.


785
00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:36.590
He had this accident
with a drill, you know.


786
00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:40.010
Yellow are less violent, you know.
Like vehicular accidents... cars, bikes.


787
00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:40.790
I lied.

788
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:45.790
<i>What are the white?</i>

789
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:48.090
Digestives. You know, poisonings?

790
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:50.890
- Mostly arsenic.
- Arsenic.


791
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:52.190
Yeah. Strange, huh?

792
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:55.190
Hey, I'm gonna go
heat this up.


793
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:27.490
<i>Oh. How fast was that session?</i>

794
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:33.790
All right. Well... hold on to your problems
and I'll see you all next week.


795
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:36.290
- And then it was kind of fun.
- I don't know.


796
00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:38.790
Hey! We're all going to
the dive bar, right?


797
00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:40.990
I think I'm just gonna go home.

798
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:45.190
Oh, come on!
We're going to McNasty's. You know.


799
00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:49.290
Well, I really have to catch up on my sleep,
so, um, see you guys later.


800
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:52.890
Uh! Really?

801
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:56.890
Should we follow her?

802
00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:03.790
<i>...and I have a confession to make. You know,
this, uh, pumpkin pie, when I say I love it so much,</i>


803
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:07.290
I really, really, really love key lime pie.
Do you like key lime pie? I lov--


804
00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:12.290
My mom used to do make it this, this way
and she put the crust on it with it. It just...


805
00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:16.590
<i>Amazing. For really good behavior</i>

806
00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:18.290
<i>she'd reward us
with key lime pie.</i>


807
00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:22.490
For just moderate behavior,
she'd reward us with pecan pie.


808
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:27.790
And, um... Is everything okay?
I-I feel like there's something on your mind.


809
00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:30.090
No, I'm fine.

810
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:33.090
What's the matter?

811
00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:40.290
What if you found out that a friend
of yours was doing something wrong?


812
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:44.590
Something really, <i>really</i> bad.
What would you do?


813
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:49.000
If you're really her friend...

814
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.200
I think you try
to get her to stop.

815
01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:17.240
- Alex?
- I thought I saw a friend.


816
01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:42.090
Aah!

817
01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:46.190
<i>Who are you?</i>

818
01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:49.110
Oh, Alex, I'm pretty sure
you know who we are.


819
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:52.190
We've been waiting for you, Alex.
And now that you're here,


820
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.390
it's time for <i>you</i>
to answer some questions.


821
01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:58.690
Like, for instance,
what in the hell is going on?


822
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:02.190
I don't know what
you're talking about.


823
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:05.890
We've been sitting up in Heaven laughing
about how you girls just pretend--


824
01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:08.090
Oh, come on!
You guys are in <i>Heaven?</i>


825
01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.190
Hey! We're some damn good guys.

826
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:15.690
Oh, that's not what I heard. I mean, I don't
think anyone misses you. You guys are jerks.


827
01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:19.640
- Hey, hey! Our mommies miss us. A lot.
- Yeah.


828
01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.290
Well, I don't think that counts cause I'm sure
that <i>Ted Bundy's</i> mom misses <i>him.</i>


829
01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:28.190
I never killed anyone,
unlike certain people... in this room.


830
01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:32.590
All right, well I understand why you're haunting me,
but what are <i>you</i> doing here?


831
01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:35.190
Jesus, she still doesn't get it.

832
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:39.020
We would not be here
unless <i>you</i>... let us in.


833
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:41.190
Why would I do that?

834
01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:43.490
Because you know
what's going on, Alex.


835
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:48.090
You know what they're doin'. You know what
they're doin' and it's your job to stop it.


836
01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:50.790
I don't wannna talk about it.

837
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:55.890
- <i>Come on, Alex.
- Wake up, Alex!</i>


838
01:01:56.790 --> 01:02:02.290
- Al-ex.
- Wake up, Alex. Wake up, wake up, wake up...


839
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:08.290
Hey, Alex. Alex, wake up.
Alex! Alex, wake <i>up!</i>


840
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:10.290
- Ahh!
- Jesus!


841
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.190
- Uh uh uh!
- "Postman", huh?


842
01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:18.990
- I'm sorry about that.
- We trusted you, Alex.


843
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:22.190
- Yeah, we thought you were our friend.
- Well, I'm still your friend.


844
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:23.290
Then why didn't you say anything?

845
01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:25.990
Yeah, I wasted a whole
Bray's rack of lamb on you, too.


846
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:28.590
Well, I didn't tell you because
I didn't think it was gonna work out.


847
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:31.790
- What did you tell him about us?
- Nothing, I would never tell him about Rick.


848
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:33.590
I was the one driving, remember?

849
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:37.690
- Ah.
- What's going on here?


850
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:40.090
We woke up with a dead hooker
in our bed


851
01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.090
and we don't have
anyone else to call.


852
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:45.790
So you guys ain't gonna...
hurt me?


853
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:50.690
Alex... my God, you gotta stop
watching those cop shows.


854
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:52.190
They're making you weird.

855
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.490
No...
We want you to be happy.


856
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:57.990
It's just...

857
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:00.490
I've got some big shit
going down.


858
01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:01.890
<i>What?</i>

859
01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:05.790
I'm being audited and
I need your help.


860
01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:10.590
So why don't you just pay Uncle Sam
what he's owed and be done with it?


861
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:14.190
- Uh.
- It's a little more complicated than that.


862
01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:19.290
Yeah. We had a little
side business going.


863
01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:21.590
Well, what kind of side business?

864
01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:25.090
Well, it was...
pest removal.


865
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:27.760
Four-legged or... two?

866
01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:32.290
Do you mind if I take a shot?

867
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:39.890
No shit, huh?
Really? A whole bulletin board!


868
01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:43.090
You guys, I don't understand
how you could do this.


869
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.190
We're sick, Alex.

870
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:50.090
You know that.

871
01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:52.990
- We have issues.
- <i>Yeah, you know.</i>


872
01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:55.390
We can't really help it.
These guys were assholes.


873
01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.990
We only did it to the guys
that deserved it.


874
01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:01.190
- We actually turned a lot of women down.
- Yeah.


875
01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:04.090
I gotta know, do you think
the police are onto us?


876
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:06.770
Well, I don't think so,
but they might be soon.


877
01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:09.670
You guys gotta stop
doing this right away.


878
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.990
I know! We will.

879
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:14.590
We <i>will.</i>

880
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:17.520
All right, we will, but...

881
01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:19.790
It's just this...

882
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:21.990
damn I.R.S. guy, you know.

883
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:23.490
He's a problem.

884
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.190
This is where you come in.

885
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:27.390
I have this whole
money mess thing happening and


886
01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.390
I need you to straighten it out
before Tuesday.


887
01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.490
Well, I don't get it.
Why is money is a problem?


888
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:34.990
- I did what you did.
- You put it through the company?


889
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:36.690
I didn't wanna break the law.

890
01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:38.890
I mean, you're the one
who said, that, you know,


891
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:40.890
how Uncle Sam didn't care how
the pie gets made,


892
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.890
as long as he gets a piece.

893
01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:44.740
Well, how big... is the pie?

894
01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:46.090
It's pretty big.

895
01:04:58.690 --> 01:04:59.790
Even I'm not that good.

896
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:04.690
- Oh, come on, Alex, we need your help.
- Alex, please.


897
01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:09.890
Oh, come on. Really, Alex?
We... we need you.


898
01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:15.090
<i>That's what every fixer loves to hear.
That someone needs them.</i>


899
01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:20.890
I wasn't doing anything wrong. I was...
just doing my job. ABC was my client.


900
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:27.160
I was like Switzerland or the military.
"Don't ask, don't tell." Right?


901
01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:31.090
How did you guys come up with
the idea to use arsenic?


902
01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:33.990
<i>They saw on T.V.</i>

903
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:37.290
Oh yeah, but this one is an old classic.
It's called <i>Arsenic and Old Lace.</i>


904
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:39.990
You know, Cary Grant...

905
01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:42.340
I mean, jus' no one's better
than Cary Grant.


906
01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.340
If I was gonna build a man,
I'd build him.


907
01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:47.190
I just love that they kill him
with arsenic, you know.


908
01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:48.990
Put him in the window seat.

909
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.990
<i>(Softly)</i> It's great.

910
01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:01.990
Oh! I think she just
douched with patchouli.


911
01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:10.290
Oh, wait.. You-- this... this is it.
It looks like enough?


912
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:11.190
No, way more.

913
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:21.690
Hi.

914
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:23.270
Hello.

915
01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:25.190
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.


916
01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:26.990
Hi, Harmony.

917
01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:30.190
Um, I was just wondering
how much this is.


918
01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:34.890
- It's, uh, eighty-four fifty a pound.
- Oh.


919
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:39.390
- Arsenic, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, I actually need it for my work.


920
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.490
<i>Oh.</i>

921
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:43.790
We're exterminators.

922
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:46.790
Ah. Ha.

923
01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:49.990
Don't you guys use, uh,
chemicals for that?


924
01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:54.690
No, actually, uh... you know,
with everyone going green now,


925
01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:57.990
uh, we came up with a
more holistic approach.


926
01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:02.290
Just because you're gonna kill something,
doesn't mean you hafta harm the environment.


927
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:04.030
Yeah.

928
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:06.090
I see.

929
01:07:06.095 --> 01:07:10.290
Well, um, how much of this stuff
would I need to kill a rat?


930
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:17.090
- 'Bout... that much... right here.
- Oh.


931
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:18.940
What about a horse?

932
01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:23.190
Mmm... like, two of those.

933
01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:25.040
Could we-- do you have any in back?

934
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:27.490
We need enough to kill
a whole herd of horses.


935
01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:30.990
You know, actually,
water's the problem.


936
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:34.890
You know, because you got to get them to
drink a lot of it or else it doesn't work.


937
01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:38.990
So liquor, wine...
<i>no problemo.</i>


938
01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:41.690
- It was that easy?
- <i>Yup!</i>


939
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:44.240
And then, you know,
word got out and pfff!


940
01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:47.240
You won't believe how many unhappy women
there are in this world.


941
01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.990
And no court of law is ever
gonna give them justice.


942
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:52.790
Well, didn't it ever occur to you guys
that you could be caught?


943
01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.990
You know, the Lakota Indians...

944
01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.690
they believe that when you've
made a decision, you know,


945
01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:01.270
and you've...
really committed to something,


946
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:05.990
that the whole universe aligns
behind you, you know, to kind of...


947
01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:08.170
propel you forward.

948
01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:13.890
I know, I think the Indians say it better,
but I know what you mean.


949
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.290
You get it, though. Right?

950
01:08:18.690 --> 01:08:20.790
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

951
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:23.750
<i>♪ Got a secret,

966
01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:29.390
Is there anything else you'd like
me to explain to you, or...?


967
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:33.090
Miss Case, this would probably go a lot
faster if I had some privacy.


968
01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:38.390
Oh. O-o-okay, We should, uh, go...
around the corner. Sorry!


969
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.280
Damn!
I wanted that.


970
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:39.590
Miss Case!

971
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:47.190
Uh! I'm going to need to...
take these with me.


972
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:48.490
Great!

973
01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:51.090
I'll be, uh, in
touch in a few days.

974
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.490
Why am I nervous?

975
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:30.670
Well, hello there, handsome.

976
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:33.690
Oh... Kim Clark?

977
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:37.590
Naw. She don't live here any more.
She moved <i>months</i> ago.


978
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:41.190
Well, can yell me where I can
find her, it's important.


979
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:42.090
You a cop?

980
01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:44.750
Not exactly, I'm with the I.R.S.

981
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:49.090
I'm investigating a case and
I need to talk to Kim Clark.


982
01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:52.990
Can't help ya. She moved <i>months</i> ago,
right after her husband died.


983
01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:54.790
And you are...?

984
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:56.290
Rita.

985
01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:57.690
Rita what?

986
01:11:57.790 --> 01:12:00.190
Rita not-tell-you-my-last-name.

987
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:06.290
Well, can you tell me where I can
find the person who runs this place?


988
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.190
You're lookin' at 'er.

989
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:12.590
Oh. Well, maybe you could
explain something to me...


990
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:17.090
Uh, did this building have any
kind of infestation problem,


991
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:19.390
say, around the time Mr. Clark died?

992
01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:23.990
Are you tryin' to say
that my property is <i>dirty?</i>


993
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:28.290
I'll tell you <i>right</i> now, I had
the Housing Inspector out here <i>last</i> month


994
01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.030
and we got a clean bill of health!

995
01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:35.940
Okay. I-- I'm... Sorry. I'm sure you did.
I'm not trying to insult you.


996
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:38.940
I'm just trying to find out
why Mrs. Clark paid


997
01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:42.390
an extermination company a rather
large sum of money last fall.


998
01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:46.690
Well, it wasn't for no <i>bugs,</i>
I could tell you that.


999
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:49.040
Well, all right, then.

1000
01:12:50.290 --> 01:12:51.790
You're free to go.

1001
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:57.590
Yes I am. And you're free
to stay away from here!


1002
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:59.990
If I see you again,
I take a shotgun to <i>you!</i>


1003
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:04.390
<i>Get out of here, you Mr. I.R.S Man!
I've had it with you. I've had it!</i>


1004
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:06.290
You're a very rude person.

1005
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:09.490
<i>Oh, you government guys...
they're all the same.</i>


1006
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:12.090
Oh ho ho!
Yeah, back to ya, buddy!


1007
01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:15.890
Hey, I got a double dose for <i>you!</i>
Government man.


1008
01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:25.290
Hi! Can I help you?

1009
01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:27.390
I'm sorry to bother you, but

1010
01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:32.290
I'm Robert Hutt, I'm an investigator
with the Internal Revenue Service.


1011
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:34.490
- Oh!
- Who is it, Blanca?


1012
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:38.290
It's, uh, Mr. Hutt...
from the Internal Revenue Service.


1013
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:43.790
- I'm Danielle Cantor.
- <i>...wanna talk to you a sec.</i>


1014
01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:46.090
<i>We're all friends here.</i>

1015
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:47.990
Can I help you?

1016
01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:00.490
I've missed you these last few days.

1017
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:02.590
Me too. I've been so busy.

1018
01:14:02.690 --> 01:14:04.790
Yeah, I know, your friends.
I understand.


1019
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:08.590
But there's something
we need to talk about.


1020
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.790
What?

1021
01:14:19.290 --> 01:14:21.290
Alex, these last few months
have been great.


1022
01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:24.640
And I want us to be together...
always.


1023
01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:25.690
But...

1024
01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.340
honesty is the most important
thing in a relationship,


1025
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:30.390
so there's something
I need to know.


1026
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:36.990
Can you <i>really</i> cook?

1027
01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:39.690
What?

1028
01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:41.190
I mean, don't get defensive,
but come on!


1029
01:14:41.190 --> 01:14:43.090
At your house, we have
lamb shank, brochettes...


1030
01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:44.890
At my house you can
barely boil water.


1031
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:49.490
I can't cook. That was Stella.
She's been doing it.


1032
01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:52.390
I knew it!

1033
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.490
Oh my God, don't cry.
Please don't cry.


1034
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:56.890
It's no big deal, really.

1035
01:14:58.590 --> 01:15:01.390
I just... something I needed
to know before I did this...


1036
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:10.210
Alexandra Case...
Will you marry me?


1037
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:12.550
Oh, my God.

1038
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:19.290
Okay, this is the part
where you say "Yes".


1039
01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.490
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1040
01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:33.490
I love you, Alex.

1041
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:36.650
I love <i>you.</i> But maybe there
some things I should tell you about,


1042
01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:38.620
some things that I'm not proud of.

1043
01:15:38.690 --> 01:15:41.890
Whatever went on before...
doesn't matter.


1044
01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:44.810
The only thing that matters is what
happens from this day forward.


1045
01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:47.290
- Really?
- Here, come here.


1046
01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:51.690
'Cause I don't wannna lose you.

1047
01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:55.270
You won't.

1048
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:20.040
Excuse me, Miss Case.

1049
01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:21.540
Ohh... Mr. Hutt.

1050
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:24.090
I'm sorry to interrupt
your little celebration


1051
01:16:24.090 --> 01:16:25.890
but I thought I should
you know I've discovered


1052
01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:29.290
some discrepancies with the work
you did for ABC Pest.


1053
01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:31.290
Oh, well, I find that
hard to believe,


1054
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:32.490
but if you wanna call me
at my office,


1055
01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.990
I'd be happy to talk to you
about it tomorrow, so...


1056
01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:35.092
Excuse me.

1057
01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.440
It can't wait.

1058
01:16:40.890 --> 01:16:42.670
If you don't get outta my way,
I'm gonna scream!


1059
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:47.910
Oh, please do.
Call your little cop boyfriend.


1060
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:52.390
There's a lot of things I'd <i>love</i> to
tell him about <i>you</i>... and your friends.


1061
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:54.790
I don't know what
you're talking about.


1062
01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:57.690
Don't be stupid, Miss Case.

1063
01:16:59.090 --> 01:17:00.390
Remember...

1064
01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:02.890
We're the I.R.S.

1065
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:06.890
I know <i>everything</i> about you.

1066
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:12.290
<i>I know you graduated 16th
in your class at Austin College.</i>


1067
01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:16.090
<i>By the way, the boyfriend
was only number 437.</i>


1068
01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:19.790
I know you spent more money on
your hair than you do on food.


1069
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:25.790
I know you got your living room chairs at
Neiman Marcus, $750, including delivery.


1070
01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:29.790
I know your parents are dead and
your sister lives in Connecticut.


1071
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:33.490
I also know you finally
got yourself a nice guy.


1072
01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:37.190
And what you and your friends have
been doing could ruin everything.


1073
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:40.890
What do you want?

1074
01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:44.290
The numbers in that ledger
are a lie and you know it.


1075
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:49.790
You tell me everything you know about
ABC Pest, I become a hero to my bosses


1076
01:17:49.890 --> 01:17:53.070
and the bad guys... or <i>girls,</i>

1077
01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:55.090
<i>go to jail.</i>

1078
01:17:58.290 --> 01:18:00.290
And he doesn't have
to know a thing.


1079
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:03.120
It's him or them, you choose.

1080
01:18:03.190 --> 01:18:05.990
But if I don't hear from you
within 48 hours,


1081
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:12.390
I'm going to have to pay a little visit
to Officer Daniel J. Burke, number 437.


1082
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:18.590
Hey. What's going on?

1083
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:22.090
I just, uh, feel really...
dizzy from the wine.


1084
01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:23.690
Do you mind if we go home?

1085
01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:27.340
Yeah, it's been a big night.
Come on. You all right?


1086
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:33.690
Well, this is a really big day, girls.
We have a graduate here.


1087
01:18:33.690 --> 01:18:35.590
Congratulations, Alex.

1088
01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:41.190
I mean, to think a year ago...
you walked in a miserable,


1089
01:18:41.370 --> 01:18:44.090
<i>angry, sad and depressed woman.</i>

1090
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:46.090
<i>And now look at you.</i>

1091
01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:50.390
You're this happy and vivacious woman
with her whole life ahead of her.


1092
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:52.490
I've done great work.

1093
01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:00.490
All right.
One last trip to McNasty's.


1094
01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:02.890
I think I should go home.

1095
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:04.190
- Oh, come on.
- What?!?


1096
01:19:04.190 --> 01:19:06.270
<i>No. No, no, no!</i>

1097
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:08.340
You <i>do</i> you realize
this is it, right?


1098
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:11.390
- Come on, one last drink.
- It's never just one.


1099
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:15.490
<i>Shh! Here she comes.
Shh!</i>


1100
01:19:16.090 --> 01:19:17.890
<i>Surprise!</i>

1101
01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:26.160
Please, everybody!
Could you grab a glass?


1102
01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:28.590
It's-it's good champagne.
I paid for it.


1103
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:31.690
And I just- I just like to say a
very quick thing and make a toast.


1104
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:34.190
I know you're expecting me to say
something really <i>funny</i> right now,


1105
01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:35.190
but I'm not gonna do that.

1106
01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:38.190
Because, uh, I really
just wanna say...


1107
01:19:39.690 --> 01:19:44.490
that... our friend Alex really defines
the definition of a true friend, and


1108
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:47.990
I know we all love her here, and
we're all gonna really miss her.


1109
01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:50.940
- So, we love you, Alex.
- <i>Yeah.</i>


1110
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:53.490
- To Alex.
- <i>To Alex!</i>


1111
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.890
Hey, I wanna take up smoking
so I can have skin like yours.


1112
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:06.590
Man...

1113
01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:08.790
Think they'll ever
let us graduate?


1114
01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:10.090
No!

1115
01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:14.690
Okay, that wouldn't be
a good idea, would it?


1116
01:20:16.090 --> 01:20:17.690
I need a drink.

1117
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:20.590
Happy.

1118
01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:24.290
Does anybody wanna play pool?

1119
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:28.790
- <i>Heyyy!</i>
- Hey.


1120
01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:29.970
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1121
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:34.220
Yeah, I was just thinking that, um,

1122
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:36.785
that everything good in my life
I owe to you guys.


1123
01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:39.090
Awww!

1124
01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:41.490
I'm gonna really miss you.

1125
01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:43.890

Jesus, it's hot in here.

1133
01:22:02.890 --> 01:22:06.090
I want you to know... I really
tried to do the right thing.


1134
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:07.990
I really did.

1135
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.540
But one thing
I learned in therapy...


1136
01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:12.790
is that I don't always have
to do the right thing.


1137
01:22:13.190 --> 01:22:16.890
I mean, sometimes I can just do...

<i>You understand that, don't you?</i>

01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:24.190
Do you need more water?

1140
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:36.890
They say that water is a problem,
you hafta... drink a <i>lot</i> of it.


1141
01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.990
What have you done?

1142
01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:46.490
I just did what any girl would do
if she woke up


1143
01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:48.490
and she found a dead hooker
in my bed...


1144
01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:50.740
I called my friends.

1145
01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.490
