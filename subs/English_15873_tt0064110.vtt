Why? How could it happen?

11
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.832
Another 100 meters

12
00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:32.670
and the Americans would have captured
the Obercassel Bridge.


13
00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:36.386
It was the only escape route
for our units in that sector.


14
00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:39.351
Escape route'? No.

15
00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:42.850
A highway for the American army
into the heart of Germany.


16

There's only one bridge left.

by the American forces.

One breakthrough,
a few hours, and it too can be lost.


22
00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:05.619
General von Brock,

23
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.624
you must prepare to destroy the Remagen
Bridge at the earliest possible moment.


24
00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:13.339
Destroy?

25
00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:19.641
We have 75,000 men who would be trapped
on the other side of the Rhine.


26
00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:21.760
And if the bridge falls to the enemy,

27
00:04:21.843 --> 00:04:23.891
are you prepared for the consequences?

28
00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:27.061
These men are
all that's left of the 15th Army.


29
00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:30.064
Their only hope of salvation is that bridge.

30
00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:32.441
The 15th Army will stand or die.

31
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.866
The Fuhrer has ordered
that not one foot of our sacred soil


32
00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:41.621
will be yielded to the enemy.

33
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.083
<i>Herr Feldmarschall,</i>

34
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:48.203
if orders won wars,

35
00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:52.257
we wouldn't now be fighting
with our backs against the Rhine.


36

We'd be dancing at the London Savoy.

37
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.184
I suggest you speak
more carefully, <i>Herr</i> General.


38
00:05:06.263 --> 00:05:07.890
You might be misunderstood.

39
00:05:11.226 --> 00:05:12.899
These are your written orders.

40
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.398
Under present conditions,
I must require your countersignature.

46
00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:49.690

Just got word from G-2.

50
00:09:07.462 --> 00:09:10.056
At least 50,000 Germans are still here,

51
00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:11.925
on this side of the Rhine,

52

the bridge at Remagen.


53

But we're gonna cut 'em off.
Who's out front now, Colonel Dent?

All right, now, listen to me.

58
00:09:26.648 --> 00:09:28.696
I want those Germans.

59
00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:33.034
I want an armored recon outfit to
make an all-out run for the river.

we're gonna find.

68
00:09:52.173 --> 00:09:53.641
I know we can, sir.

69
00:09:53.716 --> 00:09:55.844
It's our only chance
to grab the 15th Army

70
00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:57.637
before it reaches the Remagen Bridge

71
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.222
and hightails it across the Rhine.

would still be in one piece

- Forget bridges.

00:43:56.382 --> 00:43:59.556
This is Captain Baumann,
our chief engineering officer. Major Kreuger.


483
00:44:00.219 --> 00:44:01.721
I'm glad you're here, <i>Herr</i> Major.

484
00:44:01.804 --> 00:44:03.351
<i>Herr</i> Major, if we don't leave the bridge,

485
00:44:03.431 --> 00:44:04.808
we'll never be ready to blow it.

486
00:44:05.224 --> 00:44:06.771
The most immediate problem, Baumann,

487
00:44:06.809 --> 00:44:09.528
is not to blow the bridge up,
but to keep it up.


488
00:44:10.104 --> 00:44:11.321
Excuse me, <i>Herr</i> Major,

489
00:44:11.397 --> 00:44:14.196
but is it not true the Fuhrer has
ordered the bridge destroyed?


490
00:44:14.525 --> 00:44:16.903
Has the Fuhrer transmitted
his orders directly to you,


491
00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.948
or are you simply spreading idle gossip?

492
00:44:21.365 --> 00:44:22.617
But I only understood that...

493
00:44:22.658 --> 00:44:26.003
At this moment, Baumann, a loose tongue
is our most dangerous enemy.


494
00:44:27.121 --> 00:44:28.418
As an officer, surely you know

495
00:44:28.456 --> 00:44:30.379
the penalty for spreading defeatist rumors.

496
00:44:30.791 --> 00:44:32.543
- Please sit down, Captain Schmidt.
- Certainly.


497
00:44:34.962 --> 00:44:36.430
Baumann, you stay.

498
00:44:38.758 --> 00:44:41.227
Can you brief me
on the condition of all of the units


499
00:44:41.302 --> 00:44:42.804
listed at our disposal here?

500
00:44:43.512 --> 00:44:45.981
Regular company. ls it fit for instant duty?

501
00:44:47.141 --> 00:44:49.064
But there is no regular company.

502
00:44:50.436 --> 00:44:51.938
KREUGER: I don't understand.

503
00:44:52.647 --> 00:44:53.990
It's been transferred.

504
00:44:55.149 --> 00:44:56.196
Huh.

505
00:44:56.567 --> 00:44:58.820
The reserve company. ls it fully equipped?

506
00:44:59.654 --> 00:45:01.122
SCHMIDT: It no longer exists.

507
00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:04.868
And the 600 Polish and Russian volunteers?
Can we count on them?


508
00:45:05.952 --> 00:45:08.421
The so called volunteers have vanished.

509
00:45:10.539 --> 00:45:14.544
Captain Schmidt,
on paper at least you have some 1,600 men.


510
00:45:16.504 --> 00:45:18.006
How many, in fact, do you have?

511
00:45:19.382 --> 00:45:21.259
About 200.

512
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.228
Including the bridge detail.

513
00:45:26.222 --> 00:45:27.599
And the 400 militia?

514
00:45:28.224 --> 00:45:30.022
Holstein?

515
00:45:30.101 --> 00:45:31.273

517
00:45:33.688 --> 00:45:35.816
- Where are the others?
- Deserted.


518
00:45:36.983 --> 00:45:38.280
<i>Herr Kapitan,</i>

519
00:45:39.193 --> 00:45:41.195
do you realize
what you are saying is treason?


520
00:45:41.988 --> 00:45:43.160
No, Major.

521
00:45:43.781 --> 00:45:45.203
Only the truth.

522

This is Major Kreuger.

526

You will convey
this message to the general.


527
00:46:04.051 --> 00:46:06.930
It is imperative that he send
two panzer battalions at once.

(SIGHING)

529
00:46:14.145 --> 00:46:15.522
So, Captain Baumann,

530
00:46:16.188 --> 00:46:18.031
I trust that in
the event of an emergency,

531
00:46:18.566 --> 00:46:21.115
at least the explosives
are in place to blow up the bridge.


532
00:46:21.402 --> 00:46:22.654
<i>Not yet, Herr Major.</i>

533
00:46:23.029 --> 00:46:26.408
It is reported that

534
00:46:27.616 --> 00:46:29.710
But perhaps that, too, is only a rumor.

535
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:38.962
Captain Schmidt.

536
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.092
SCHMIDT: Major?

537
00:46:43.341 --> 00:46:46.595
Those towers will give us
an excellent field to fire on the bridge.


538
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.519
- What is in them?
- Two heavy machine guns on each side.


539
00:46:52.224 --> 00:46:54.943
That old barge, it will be very useful.

540
00:46:55.853 --> 00:46:57.981
- We'll put weapons on it.
- Yes, Herr Major.


541
00:46:59.857 --> 00:47:01.951
Come. Show me your defenses.

542
00:47:19.585 --> 00:47:23.055
With only 36 men, sir,
there's a limit to what we can do.


543
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.634
Sergeant Becker, I'm not asking
you to launch a major offensive.


544
00:47:26.801 --> 00:47:30.681
I'm only asking that you hold off the enemy
until our reinforcements arrive.


545
00:47:30.971 --> 00:47:34.851
Excuse me, <i>Herr</i> Major.
We have heard a lot about reinforcements.


546
00:47:35.101 --> 00:47:36.774
The men don't believe it anymore.

547
00:47:36.852 --> 00:47:39.696
I tell you two panzer battalions
will be here in a few hours.


548
00:47:41.148 --> 00:47:42.491
Do you believe me?

549
00:47:45.027 --> 00:47:46.199
<i>Yes, Herr Major.</i>

550
00:47:47.238 --> 00:47:50.538
Then you make your men believe it.
Do you understand?


551
00:48:19.103 --> 00:48:21.572
KREUGER: That's the road the
enemy tanks will have to take.


552
00:48:21.856 --> 00:48:24.325
The approaches
to the bridge, are they mined?


553
00:48:25.484 --> 00:48:27.703
SCHMIDT:
Heavily mined, <i>Herr</i> Major. Ready to blow.


554
00:48:28.779 --> 00:48:30.781
No enemy tank will reach the bridge.

555
00:48:31.824 --> 00:48:33.747
<i>Leutnant Eckert, for the moment,</i>

556
00:48:33.826 --> 00:48:36.249
these are the heaviest
defenses we have against the enemy.


557
00:48:37.037 --> 00:48:39.540
- A great deal depends on you.
- Yes, Herr Major.


558
00:48:39.957 --> 00:48:41.049
Good.

Get a work crew to strengthen
these gun emplacements at once.


562
00:49:02.188 --> 00:49:04.691
Herr Major,
still no answer from General von Brock.


563
00:49:05.232 --> 00:49:06.404
Keep trying-

564
00:49:07.401 --> 00:49:08.493
What is this?

565
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:10.788
SCHMIDT:
The master switch to destroy the bridge.


566
00:49:11.697 --> 00:49:13.449
When we have the explosives.

567
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:20.544
And the detonating circuit? 
What if it fails?

568
00:49:20.748 --> 00:49:21.874
<i>Herr Major.</i>

569
00:49:23.876 --> 00:49:27.255
Nine centimeter cable. 
Heavy steel pipe.

570
00:49:27.755 --> 00:49:29.553
The circuit is tested every hour.

571

What if it fails?

572

If we have the explosives.

575
00:49:39.141 --> 00:49:40.859
I know, Captain Schmidt.

576
00:49:41.435 --> 00:49:42.607
I know.

577
