Bitch, move!

Russell Redds, wake up.

18
00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:26.419

19
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.792
- What time did you get in last night?
- I don't know.


20
00:03:30.691 --> 00:03:32.825
'Bout 1:30, 2:00. What's up?

21
00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.529
Did you go in my purse?

22
00:03:36.463 --> 00:03:38.131
What purse?

23
00:03:38.132 --> 00:03:40.769
You think you slick, but you not.

24
00:03:41.602 --> 00:03:43.703
I don't know what you're talking about.

25
00:03:43.704 --> 00:03:45.938
Told you, I ain't got nothing

26
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.040
to contribute
to your little rap show tonight.


27
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.076
FYI, if you didn't get the memo,

28
00:03:51.077 --> 00:03:52.712
I got the money for tonight.

29
00:03:52.713 --> 00:03:55.481
All I was looking for
was just a little support


30
00:03:55.482 --> 00:03:56.949
from my woman, that's it.

31
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.918
Baby, you know I support you.

32
00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.388
You just can't spend
none of this money.


33
00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.056
I don't need none of that money.

34
00:04:04.057 --> 00:04:07.327
I'm papered out.
Modesto's finest.


35
00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:10.062
You forgot who you in love with?

36
00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.037
Fuck.

37
00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.154
Hello.

Wake your ass up, man.

40
00:04:38.124 --> 00:04:40.593
Man, what time is it, man? Shit!

<i>6:45. Get up.

<i>No. 6:45 at night.

45
00:04:51.538 --> 00:04:52.972

46
00:04:52.973 --> 00:04:55.241
<i>You know these rappers
ain't got no damn patience.</i>


47
00:04:55.242 --> 00:04:57.243
<i>I'm gonna come pick you up
at your apartment.</i>


48
00:04:57.244 --> 00:04:58.978
I got a condo. It's a condo!

49
00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.713
<i>Yeah, okay. 
Whatever, man.</i>

50
00:05:00.714 --> 00:05:02.715
Hey, Regina, wake up. Regina!

52
00:05:04.485 --> 00:05:05.851
- Shit!
- Shit!


53
00:05:05.852 --> 00:05:08.354
Jellyroll, why didn't you
wake me up?


54
00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:10.690
Shit, I overslept too. Shit.

55
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:14.527
Ronnie is gonna kill me.
Come on, we gotta go.


56
00:05:14.528 --> 00:05:15.861
You gotta take me home.

57
00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:18.964
After that second nut, I was done!

58
00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:20.966
You always nutting before me.

59
00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:22.935
- Shit, man.
- And I get nothing.


60
00:05:22.936 --> 00:05:25.238
I know that pussy got
a lot of miles on it now.


61
00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:28.441
- Yeah, and you put 'em on there.
- And a whole lotta other thugs.


62
00:05:28.442 --> 00:05:30.543
You gotta take me home.
Ronnie's gonna kill you.


63
00:05:30.544 --> 00:05:32.811
First he was gonna kill you,
now he gonna kill me?


64
00:05:32.812 --> 00:05:35.548
Ronnie's been wanting
to shoot you ever since high school.


65
00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:37.016
Come on, let's go.

66
00:05:37.017 --> 00:05:39.321
You the one who married
the fucking police.


67
00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:56.035
- There she is.
- Roll camera.


68
00:05:56.036 --> 00:05:58.571
<i>I'm Kevin Maline
with the TV show So Busted.</i>


69
00:05:58.572 --> 00:06:01.307
<i>- Can I ask you a few questions?
- My God, it's So Busted.</i>


70
00:06:01.308 --> 00:06:03.108
- Open the door!
- That's my man!


71
00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:05.745
I see you on TV!
What's up, baby?


72
00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:07.212
Why are you cheating on
your husband Ronnie


73
00:06:07.213 --> 00:06:10.182
with this very skinny and ugly man?
Do you think that's right?


74
00:06:10.183 --> 00:06:12.017
- No comment.
- Skinny and ugly!


75
00:06:12.018 --> 00:06:14.053
You Yorkshire terrier-looking
motherfucker!


76
00:06:14.054 --> 00:06:16.221
<i>- I'm the Ebony man.
- Open the door, Jellyroll.</i>


77
00:06:16.222 --> 00:06:17.656
No, no more!
You better run!


78
00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:20.225
I'm not running in these heels.
Open the damn door!


79
00:06:20.226 --> 00:06:22.928
Obviously you like his equipment
better than your husband's.


80
00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:26.198
That's right, I've been knocking
a line in that pussy for years.


81
00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.866
- Open the door!
- Regina, please.


82
00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:30.102
Answer the question.
Your husband has a right to know.


83
00:06:30.103 --> 00:06:32.240
No comment.
Jellyroll, open the door.


84
00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:34.640
- On the other side, guys.
- We're moving.


85
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:36.241
I gotta get home, Jellyroll!

86
00:06:36.242 --> 00:06:37.743
You know that this
is a married woman?


87
00:06:37.744 --> 00:06:39.712
Do you know that
I don't give a fuck?

88
00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:42.648
Hey, fuck all this.
Tonight, Jellyroll Entertainment,


89
00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:44.950
Russell Redds, 
Young Jeezy tonight.

90
00:06:44.951 --> 00:06:47.787
That's right, Jellyroll Entertainment.

91
00:06:47.788 --> 00:06:49.888
- We doing it big, baby.
- Jellyroll, let's go!


92
00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.792
You have no respect for this woman
or her marriage.


93
00:06:52.793 --> 00:06:55.665
'My God, it's him!

94
00:06:56.597 --> 00:06:58.931
It's your husband. No!

95
00:06:58.932 --> 00:07:01.537
Go, go, go, go, go!

96
00:07:05.872 --> 00:07:07.274
I love you, Regina.

97
00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:11.279
I'm-a kill you, Jellyroll!

98
00:07:24.324 --> 00:07:26.392
- I'm hit!
- Shit! Kevin's been hit!


99
00:07:26.393 --> 00:07:28.429
Call an ambulance.

100
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.166
- Stay right there, Kevin.
- Sir, are you all right?


101
00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:36.435
- You all right?
- I'm okay.


102
00:07:36.436 --> 00:07:40.343
- It just grazed me.
- I am so... so sorry.


103
00:07:41.174 --> 00:07:42.808
Please tell me we got
that on tape.


104
00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:45.444
Yeah, no.
We definitely missed that, Kevin.


105
00:07:45.445 --> 00:07:47.046
Dispatch!

106
00:07:47.047 --> 00:07:49.448
<i>This is Dispatch.
What is it now, Ronnie?</i>


107
00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:51.854
Excuse me, do you have any tissue?

108
00:07:58.224 --> 00:07:59.892
Yeah.

109
00:07:59.893 --> 00:08:02.564
Yeah, baby.

110
00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:08.167
All right, baby, I'm going.

111
00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:10.572
I'll see you later.

112
00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:15.007
Hey. Good luck.

113
00:08:15.008 --> 00:08:16.978
I don't need none.

114
00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:39.034
Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:41.401
I'm a big daddy.

116
00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:47.541
Gotcha.

117
00:08:53.246 --> 00:08:54.749
Semore.

118
00:08:56.583 --> 00:08:58.416
Semore!

119
00:08:58.417 --> 00:08:59.785
Get your ass up.

120
00:08:59.786 --> 00:09:01.887
What you doing? Get up.

121
00:09:01.888 --> 00:09:03.421
I'm asleep, Dad. 
What's the matter?

122
00:09:03.422 --> 00:09:05.891
Why you ain't up practicing
your routine for tonight?


123
00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:07.259
That's what's the matter.

124
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.996
How the fuck you gonna be like
Lil' Wayne if you sleep all morning?


125
00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:12.965
Lil' Wayne sleep all morning too.

126
00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:14.800
Yeah, but he rich, nigga.
You ain't shit.


127
00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:16.736
- Yet.
- Don't wanna hear no lip, son.


128
00:09:16.737 --> 00:09:18.771
You know I still got you
under contract.


129
00:09:18.772 --> 00:09:21.173
Yeah, I know. Six albums.

130
00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:23.576
Six albums.

131
00:09:23.577 --> 00:09:26.411
That's publishing and mel_chandise.

132
00:09:26.412 --> 00:09:28.681
You feel me? All right.

133
00:09:28.682 --> 00:09:30.048
How many dances you got?

134
00:09:30.049 --> 00:09:31.784
I got mo.

135
00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:33.786
They fine?

136
00:09:33.787 --> 00:09:35.420
- Yeah?
- Yes, sir.


137
00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:38.894
No ugly dances, man.
They gotta be fine with ass.


138
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.263
You already know I can't handle
ugly girls onstage with me.


139
00:09:44.264 --> 00:09:47.099
Them booty shorts, too.
I like that.


140
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.834
That's what we want, ass.

141
00:09:48.835 --> 00:09:51.671
My eyes burnin'. 
What's that smell?

142
00:09:51.672 --> 00:09:54.911
That's that new cologne
I'm trying out. You like it?


143
00:09:55.742 --> 00:09:57.543
Smell like pepper spray.

144
00:09:57.544 --> 00:09:59.477
Now get up, man,
and practice your routine.


145
00:09:59.478 --> 00:10:03.115
I want you tight, and I'm gonna be
back to check on those dancers.


146
00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:04.550
- All right.
- Yeah.


147
00:10:04.551 --> 00:10:05.918
Get your swag up, man.

148
00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:07.654
You need to check
on that cologne, Pop.


149
00:11:27.566 --> 00:11:28.868
Goddamn it.

150
00:11:28.869 --> 00:11:30.736
Where's Michael Vick
when you need him?


151
00:11:30.737 --> 00:11:34.206
Biscuit.
Get out the way!


152
00:11:34.207 --> 00:11:35.642
What y'all doing?

153
00:11:39.913 --> 00:11:43.085
Go! Get the hell outta the way.
Shit!


154
00:11:47.586 --> 00:11:48.854
Hey, Mom.

155
00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:50.990
What the fuck you want, Russell?

156
00:11:50.991 --> 00:11:52.892
Girl, why you got to be so mean?

157
00:11:52.893 --> 00:11:54.930
I brought you something.

158
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:58.934
Thanks, baby.

159
00:12:00.066 --> 00:12:02.600
Smell good again.
What y'all cooking?


160
00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:04.837
Crack. Wanna help?

161
00:12:04.838 --> 00:12:07.539
Nah, I got to make some runs today.

162
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.842
- How you doing, Ms. Ann?
- Hey, baby.


163
00:12:09.843 --> 00:12:11.911
You see that blue car up the street?

164
00:12:11.912 --> 00:12:13.545
Yeah, they still up there.

165
00:12:13.546 --> 00:12:15.915
Goddamn Feds been messin'
with me all morning.


166
00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:18.417
Bitch can't make
a decent dollar nowadays.


167
00:12:18.418 --> 00:12:21.253
You wonder why?
Y'all need to slow down.


168
00:12:21.254 --> 00:12:22.587
You know what I mean?

169
00:12:22.588 --> 00:12:26.792
Women your age should be
thinking about menopause.


170
00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:29.764
Y'all been slinging crack
since the '60s, Momma.


171
00:12:30.663 --> 00:12:33.631
Boy, don't ever let me see
you fix your mouth to say that.


172
00:12:33.632 --> 00:12:37.135
Me and Ms. Ann
been slinging since the 'GOs.


173
00:12:37.136 --> 00:12:40.405
Double-ups, half ounces,
ounces, grams, kilos,


174
00:12:40.406 --> 00:12:43.275
burrs, chickens, eagles,
bricks, boulders,


175
00:12:43.276 --> 00:12:45.110
cake, weight, hard, soft.

176
00:12:45.111 --> 00:12:47.012
However you want it, nigger.

177
00:12:47.013 --> 00:12:49.114
Fish scales! Whatever.

178
00:12:49.115 --> 00:12:51.116
Just hit me on my Blackberry.

179
00:12:51.117 --> 00:12:54.053
See? Y'all getting too old
for this shit.


180
00:12:54.054 --> 00:12:56.355
What do you want?
You fixing to get on my nerves.


181
00:12:56.356 --> 00:12:59.558
You breaking my concentration.

182
00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:02.898
Y'all know tonight's the night,
right?


183
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.267
No. To do what?

184
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.202
I do that big show over
at the Mercy Theatre tonight.


185
00:13:10.203 --> 00:13:12.440
Well, what do you do?

186
00:13:16.476 --> 00:13:18.579
I'm a promoter, Momma.

187
00:13:19.846 --> 00:13:23.285
Me and Jellyroll, we been doing
this for, like, four years now.


188
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.753
Well, you must not be any good.
Why we ain't heard about the show?


189
00:13:27.754 --> 00:13:30.688
'Cause y'all are too old
to be worried about hip-hop.


190
00:13:30.689 --> 00:13:34.330
Y'all need to be worried about
when Al Green coming to town.


191
00:13:35.294 --> 00:13:38.163
Well, can I tell you no
right now before you ask,


192
00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:39.664
'cause I know what you want.

193
00:13:39.665 --> 00:13:42.001
Come on, Momma. Look.

194
00:13:42.002 --> 00:13:46.105
All I need is a one-day loan,
the kind you be giving out.


195
00:13:46.106 --> 00:13:48.440
How short are you?

196
00:13:48.441 --> 00:13:51.209
Now, I got to pay for the building,

197
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.978
I got to get the hotels,

198
00:13:52.979 --> 00:13:55.713
and, you know, these rappers
be having all kind of requests,


199
00:13:55.714 --> 00:13:58.417
so, you know,
we about 9500 in the hole.


200
00:13:58.418 --> 00:14:01.156
Ninety-five hundred!

201
00:14:02.721 --> 00:14:06.724
Why don't you spend your Aruba money
instead of wasting it on Aruba?


202
00:14:06.725 --> 00:14:09.661
Now, you know
I cannot spend that money.


203
00:14:09.662 --> 00:14:11.430
That's my wedding money, okay?

204
00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:14.232
If I spend the Aruba money,
ain't no reason to go to Aruba,


205
00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:16.035
'cause Loli ain't gonna
marry me anyway.


206
00:14:16.036 --> 00:14:17.602
What's wrong with being single?

207
00:14:17.603 --> 00:14:19.706
I ain't never been married,
and I'm cool.


208
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:25.911
Momma, you got to stop hating
on my relationship.


209
00:14:25.912 --> 00:14:29.314
You sound like a bitch.

210
00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:31.383
No! The answer is no.

211
00:14:31.384 --> 00:14:34.586
Me and Ms. Ann got
to re-up tonight, Mr. Promoter,


212
00:14:34.587 --> 00:14:36.421
so think of a new one.

213
00:14:36.422 --> 00:14:39.191
Just because I told you
your daddy might be Don King


214
00:14:39.192 --> 00:14:43.333
don't mean you gotta be running around
acting like you some damn promoter.


215
00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:48.433
Well, maybe it's just in my blood.

216
00:14:48.434 --> 00:14:50.602
Yeah, well, whatever.

217
00:14:50.603 --> 00:14:53.338
See you at church tomorrow.

218
00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:55.809
See y'all at church.

219
00:15:07.453 --> 00:15:09.588
- Hey, baby.
- Drive!


220
00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:11.523
- What's the matter?
- Drive, man!


221
00:15:11.524 --> 00:15:13.092
- What's going on?
- Would you drive?


222
00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:15.194
It's going down around here.

223
00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:16.661
What's the matter?

224
00:15:16.662 --> 00:15:20.298
Man, that nigger Ronnie Stixx
tried to kill me again.


225
00:15:20.299 --> 00:15:22.134
You fucking all on his wife, man.

226
00:15:22.135 --> 00:15:25.370
But not all the time.
Every now and then I'm hitting it.


227
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:27.805
- Still hitting that.
- What's happening?


228
00:15:27.806 --> 00:15:30.475
I'm gonna need half
of your money by show time,


229
00:15:30.476 --> 00:15:32.477
or at least by sound check, man.

230
00:15:32.478 --> 00:15:35.347
This building owner is on my ass.

231
00:15:35.348 --> 00:15:38.050
Every five minutes he calling me
about that money.


232
00:15:38.051 --> 00:15:40.185
Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

233
00:15:40.186 --> 00:15:42.454
- You got your half?
- I got my half.


234
00:15:42.455 --> 00:15:44.856
- Cool, cool.
- When you gonna have yours?


235
00:15:44.857 --> 00:15:47.292
After I go pick them up from the hotel,
I'm gonna have my half.


236
00:15:47.293 --> 00:15:48.894
What the ticket sales looking like?

237
00:15:48.895 --> 00:15:51.130
Ticket sales ain't doing too good.

238
00:15:51.131 --> 00:15:53.565
- What?
- Shit, we in Modesto.


239
00:15:53.566 --> 00:15:55.467
Everybody know
this is a walk-up town.


240
00:15:55.468 --> 00:15:56.868
This is a word-of-mouth town.

241
00:15:56.869 --> 00:15:59.571
Word of mouth
you know what I mean?


242
00:15:59.572 --> 00:16:02.975
That's just how the town is.
This is Modesto, man.


243
00:16:02.976 --> 00:16:06.148
This is where people come
when they on the run from the police.


244
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:23.562
All right, man.
Keep your ass in the car.


245
00:16:23.563 --> 00:16:25.366
You know you're in the computer.

246
00:16:37.643 --> 00:16:39.377
- May I help you?
- Hey, hey, hey.


247
00:16:39.378 --> 00:16:40.712
Hey, there, Chris.

248
00:16:40.713 --> 00:16:43.515
I work for a company
called Russell Redds, Inc.,


249
00:16:43.516 --> 00:16:46.451
and we got
a 15-passenger van reserved.


250
00:16:46.452 --> 00:16:51.695
The confirmation number is B2TT54.

251
00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:53.992
Okay, Mr. Redds.

252
00:16:53.993 --> 00:16:56.261
I'm gonna need a credit card
and driver's license.


253
00:16:56.262 --> 00:16:57.963
Of course you do.

254
00:16:57.964 --> 00:17:00.299
Got that right here.
How are you doing?


255
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.866
Good, good, thank you.

256
00:17:01.867 --> 00:17:04.736
And did you want insurance on the van?
That is an additional cost.


257
00:17:04.737 --> 00:17:06.972
Yeah, you know,
give me full coverage,


258
00:17:06.973 --> 00:17:08.840
everything you got.

259
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:10.809
Okay, let me set that up for you.

260
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.778
Set that up for me, Chris.

261
00:17:13.779 --> 00:17:17.215
What do you mean?

262
00:17:17.216 --> 00:17:19.651
We're gonna have to charge you
a cleaning fee.


263
00:17:19.652 --> 00:17:22.654
A cleaning fee? I ain't never
heard of no cleaning fee.


264
00:17:22.655 --> 00:17:24.756
The last two times
we rented you vehicle


265
00:17:24.757 --> 00:17:28.060
- we found paraphernalia inside...
- What kind of paraphernalia?


266
00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:30.395
Marijuana.
That's what I have on record.


267
00:17:30.396 --> 00:17:33.065
Look, you know what,
just to be honest, Chris?


268
00:17:33.066 --> 00:17:35.467
The cabin smelled like marijuana
when we got it.


269
00:17:35.468 --> 00:17:37.036
I'm just putting that out there.

270
00:17:37.037 --> 00:17:40.172
- I'm just putting out a cleaning fee.
- Yeah, okay, whatever, man.


271
00:17:40.173 --> 00:17:43.508
And this credit card is maxed out.
Do you have another one?


272
00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:45.946
- Wait a minute, man. I can't be...
- That's...


273
00:17:48.814 --> 00:17:50.315
All right, man. Shit.

274
00:17:50.316 --> 00:17:53.652
Try this one, and then
if that don't work, try that one.


275
00:17:53.653 --> 00:17:55.354
Interesting.

276
00:17:55.355 --> 00:17:58.423
Y'all throw in the navigational system
with that too.


277
00:17:58.424 --> 00:18:01.293
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we want that.


278
00:18:01.294 --> 00:18:02.861
- We want all that.
- You got it.


279
00:18:02.862 --> 00:18:04.365
Thank you.

280
00:18:05.198 --> 00:18:08.133
Where that little cute thing
that used to work here?


281
00:18:08.134 --> 00:18:10.202
She's gone. We found
marijuana in her car too.


282
00:18:10.203 --> 00:18:12.137
She probably the one
who put the shit in my van,


283
00:18:12.138 --> 00:18:14.140
but I ain't gonna say
nothing about that.


284
00:18:52.178 --> 00:18:54.682
Let's do this, old man.

285
00:18:56.116 --> 00:18:57.451
Modesto, baby!

286
00:18:58.851 --> 00:19:00.318
Do what it do!

287
00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:02.754
Where that weed at?

288
00:19:02.755 --> 00:19:04.423
Yeah, man, I'm wondering

289
00:19:04.424 --> 00:19:06.891
what kind of females
they got out here in Modesto.


290
00:19:06.892 --> 00:19:09.728
Let's get this money first.
Worry about them broads later.


291
00:19:09.729 --> 00:19:11.763
I'm trying to...

292
00:19:11.764 --> 00:19:14.098
Modest-hos!

293
00:19:14.099 --> 00:19:15.167
Hey, smile, dog.

294
00:19:15.168 --> 00:19:19.438
They act like they ain't never
seen no black people out.


295
00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:23.007
No, what it is, they ain't
never seen no rich black folk.


296
00:19:23.008 --> 00:19:25.543
Ain't but one of us rich.
What they looking at you for?


297
00:19:25.544 --> 00:19:27.146
Yeah. Yeah.

298
00:19:27.147 --> 00:19:28.649
My goodness.

299
00:19:29.515 --> 00:19:32.684
It is you! My God!

300
00:19:32.685 --> 00:19:34.453
Can I get an autograph?

301
00:19:34.454 --> 00:19:37.855
Take a picture, get a hug?
Hook me up with a CD!


302
00:19:37.856 --> 00:19:40.525
If you were to pump your brakes
and introduce yourself to me,


303
00:19:40.526 --> 00:19:43.928
his road manager, Young Percy,
I could've hooked you up.


304
00:19:43.929 --> 00:19:47.399
That's cool, that's cool, brother!
Can you take a picture of us? Great.


305
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.770
- And can I get a hug?
- Come on with it.


306
00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.206
- It's all good.
- What are y'all doing here?


307
00:19:54.207 --> 00:19:56.608
Got a show tonight.
That shit gonna be crazy.


308
00:19:56.609 --> 00:19:59.013
- I know you heard about it, right?
- No.


309

00:27:28.761 --> 00:27:30.327
I can smell the gunpowder on it.

456
00:27:30.328 --> 00:27:33.264
- He took the keys.
- You let the nigger take the keys?


457
00:27:33.265 --> 00:27:36.200
- Man, like I knew!
- Percy, that's bullshit.


458
00:27:36.201 --> 00:27:37.669
Jeezy, I got your back.

459
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.471
Probably getting robbed
or some shit, man.


460
00:27:40.472 --> 00:27:42.575
Serves him right for having us
up in the hood.


461
00:27:44.443 --> 00:27:47.181
- 350.
- 350. You got it.


462
00:27:49.581 --> 00:27:51.451
Give me the money.

463
00:27:52.818 --> 00:27:54.719
That's how we doing it.

464
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.120
- Look.
- What's that?


465
00:27:56.121 --> 00:27:59.023
You tell Russell Redds
the next time he sends you


466
00:27:59.024 --> 00:28:01.058
over to my house
for some illegal shit,


467
00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:03.995
- he gonna get shot too.
- I'm-a tell him what you said.


468
00:28:03.996 --> 00:28:07.031
We're been trying to get this
concert together all day, man.


469
00:28:07.032 --> 00:28:10.001
You know me and the D-boys
is throwing an after party...


470
00:28:10.002 --> 00:28:12.003
I heard! I heard something
like that.


471
00:28:12.004 --> 00:28:15.339
So how much would it cost me
to get Young Jeezy to show up?


472
00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.573
It's gonna cost you.

473
00:28:16.574 --> 00:28:20.278
Let me holla at him,
and I'm-a let you know what he say.


474
00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:22.613
He'd better say yes.

475
00:28:22.614 --> 00:28:25.886
All right, let me handle it.

476
00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:36.294
What's happenin'!

477
00:28:36.295 --> 00:28:38.029
Where the fuck your slow ass been?

478
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.564
You got my motherfucking weed?

479
00:28:40.565 --> 00:28:42.900
Yeah, I got grape.

480
00:28:42.901 --> 00:28:45.436
- There it is, baby.
- Come on, let's go.


481
00:28:45.437 --> 00:28:48.372
I can get you a bird if you need it.
Why don't y'all calm down?


482
00:28:48.373 --> 00:28:51.242
You talk all that gangsta shit

483
00:28:51.243 --> 00:28:53.812
and now you all nervous
'cause we in the real projects.


484
00:28:53.813 --> 00:28:55.880
Ain't nobody
motherfucking nervous, man.


485
00:28:55.881 --> 00:28:59.717
My partner want to do an after party.
What y'all want to do?


486
00:28:59.718 --> 00:29:01.519
- Fuck the after party.
- I'll be right back.


487
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.055
- No, come on, man!
- Bring your ass home!


488
00:29:04.056 --> 00:29:06.326
Ike Turner-suit-wearing motherfucker.

489
00:29:08.327 --> 00:29:11.099
Mondo! I'm back, baby.

490
00:29:15.167 --> 00:29:16.667
What'd he say?

491
00:29:16.668 --> 00:29:19.237
He said he'll do it,
but it's gonna cost you.


492
00:29:19.238 --> 00:29:21.072
How much?

493
00:29:21.073 --> 00:29:22.406
Twenty Gs.

494
00:29:22.407 --> 00:29:24.208
- Twenty Gs!
- Twenty Gs, brother.


495
00:29:24.209 --> 00:29:26.944
He said 20 Gs up front
or he can't do it.


496
00:29:26.945 --> 00:29:29.814
That's what the man's saying.
I ain't, you know...


497
00:29:29.815 --> 00:29:32.550
- Let me talk to him.
- You can't talk to him, now.


498
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:35.786
You gonna scare the shit out of him.
They all scared of real niggers.


499
00:29:35.787 --> 00:29:39.456
Soon as you come out there,
they're gonna say, "Tupac's alive!"


500
00:29:39.457 --> 00:29:42.560
But how's this shit work?
The whole 20 Gs now?


501
00:29:42.561 --> 00:29:47.031
You gotta give him
the whole 20 Gs right now, up front.


502
00:29:47.032 --> 00:29:49.133
Fuck it. We gonna do it big.

503
00:29:49.134 --> 00:29:51.371
VIP, VIG. Wait right here.

504
00:29:52.237 --> 00:29:54.471
You are the best drug dealer.

505
00:29:54.472 --> 00:29:57.541
Hey, man, y'all hanging with
one of the nicest drug dealers


506
00:29:57.542 --> 00:29:59.143
I ever seen in my life.

507
00:29:59.144 --> 00:30:00.677
Jellyroll, you be hustling?

508
00:30:00.678 --> 00:30:02.449
Hey, we got to do it.

509
00:30:06.285 --> 00:30:08.121
He don't show up...

510
00:30:08.954 --> 00:30:12.290
that's his ass and yours.

511
00:30:12.291 --> 00:30:15.697
Sure it's his ass.
We gonna kill him together.


512
00:30:19.197 --> 00:30:21.198
I ain't playing.

513
00:30:21.199 --> 00:30:23.437
I heard... hey, man, that's...

514
00:30:24.836 --> 00:30:26.604
No joke, man.

515
00:30:26.605 --> 00:30:29.877
Get Jeezy out of the projects.

516
00:30:46.158 --> 00:30:48.092
Jellyroll, where you at, man?

517
00:30:48.093 --> 00:30:51.262
<i>Johnny G, at the Mercy, bro.
What's going down?</i>


518
00:30:51.263 --> 00:30:52.763
- What up, Julio?
- What's up?


519
00:30:52.764 --> 00:30:54.966
What's up is that
the ticket sales are down.


520
00:30:54.967 --> 00:30:58.702
That's what's happening.
What kind of promoters are you?


521
00:30:58.703 --> 00:31:01.772
Have you been pushing this on radio?
How many spots you got?


522
00:31:01.773 --> 00:31:05.209
<i>We've been running spots
on V1O6, man, every 3O minutes.</i>


523
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.278
You don't even listen
to black radio, man.


524
00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.679
You wouldn't even know.

525
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.215
Modesto's a big walk-up town, man.

526
00:31:11.216 --> 00:31:15.186
Walk up. Listen, I need
all the money up front, cash,


527
00:31:15.187 --> 00:31:17.155
before I open the doors,
you got that?


528
00:31:17.156 --> 00:31:19.790
You been bugging me about
that money for mo weeks, man.


529
00:31:19.791 --> 00:31:22.259
I got it. I'm gonna take care
of you at sound check.


530
00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.628
Sound check is cutting it
too close, Russell!


531
00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:26.630
I said I'm taking care
of you, right?


532
00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:29.433
Don't call me again, man.
I'm trying to handle business.


533
00:31:29.434 --> 00:31:31.735
I'm-a get you your money
at sound check.


534
00:31:31.736 --> 00:31:33.939
All right, I'll see you soon.

535
00:31:49.754 --> 00:31:51.522
Shit.

536
00:31:51.523 --> 00:31:53.657
Goddamn Aruba money.

537
00:31:53.658 --> 00:31:55.926
Fuck it. Fuck it!

538
00:31:55.927 --> 00:31:58.130
She gonna kill me.

539
00:32:27.926 --> 00:32:29.326
Hey, girl.

540
00:32:29.327 --> 00:32:31.229
- Hey, baby.
- What you doing?


541
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.964
Okay, I'm debating on
whether or not I want to do


542
00:32:33.965 --> 00:32:36.234
the silver shoes or the white
shoes for the wedding.


543
00:32:36.235 --> 00:32:39.070
I think these look too hookerish.
What you think?


544
00:32:39.071 --> 00:32:42.040
Yeah, but I like hookerish.

545
00:32:42.041 --> 00:32:45.276
I know you like hookerish,
but I gotta be able to walk.


546
00:32:45.277 --> 00:32:48.179
Is your momma coming
to Aruba with us?


547
00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.813
I don't know.

548
00:32:49.814 --> 00:32:52.116
If she do, she gonna have
to sneak on.


549
00:32:52.117 --> 00:32:54.685
- Why?
- You know she's still on parole.


550
00:32:54.686 --> 00:32:58.155
- Three years ain't up yet?
- Nope. She going back too.


551
00:32:58.156 --> 00:33:00.091
Why your momma
gotta be like Frank White?


552
00:33:00.092 --> 00:33:02.696
I don't know.
She say it's in her blood.


553
00:33:03.661 --> 00:33:05.529
Where's Semore at?

554
00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:07.834
In the back, rehearsing.

555
00:33:08.933 --> 00:33:10.436
All right.

556
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.944
How you doin'?

557
00:33:20.945 --> 00:33:22.679
Y'all know what time it is.

558
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.681
Can you scoot up a little bit?

559
00:33:24.682 --> 00:33:27.020
Hey, DJ! Ha! Let's go!

560
00:33:50.575 --> 00:33:51.742
Yeah!

561
00:33:51.743 --> 00:33:54.312
Yeah, real quick.

562
00:33:54.313 --> 00:33:56.314
They know how it is, man.

563
00:33:56.315 --> 00:33:58.682
You got it, man!
That's what I'm talking about.


564
00:33:58.683 --> 00:34:00.618
What'd you think, honestly, though?

565
00:34:00.619 --> 00:34:03.587
You looked good, boy.
They ain't gonna be able to handle you.


566
00:34:03.588 --> 00:34:05.456
Modesto ain't ready for you!

567
00:34:05.457 --> 00:34:07.125
Modesto ain't ready!

568
00:34:07.126 --> 00:34:09.393
I like that, and guess what!

569
00:34:09.394 --> 00:34:11.762
LI let Jeezy hear your demo.

570
00:34:11.763 --> 00:34:13.830
For real? What'd he say?

571
00:34:13.831 --> 00:34:17.501
I can't tell you that, boy.
You might go jack-in-the-box on me.


572
00:34:17.502 --> 00:34:19.002
All right, bitches.

573
00:34:19.003 --> 00:34:21.672
You looking at Modesto's finest.

574
00:34:21.673 --> 00:34:23.006
Take it from the top. Let's go!

575
00:34:23.007 --> 00:34:25.008
Hey, wait a minute. Hold up.

576
00:34:25.009 --> 00:34:27.811
How much are we
getting paid for this?


577
00:34:27.812 --> 00:34:29.280
Y'all ain't gettin' nothing.

578
00:34:29.281 --> 00:34:31.782
Exactly, so don't call me
a motherfucking name.


579
00:34:31.783 --> 00:34:34.118
My name is Sandra,
and that's my girl Keisha.


580
00:34:34.119 --> 00:34:35.519
Can you get the shit right?

581
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.388
Yeah, look, I'm sorry, all right?

582
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:39.756
Okay, take it from the top,
motherfucker. Come on.


583
00:34:39.757 --> 00:34:42.295
Ghetto ass. Hello.

584
00:34:44.963 --> 00:34:46.799

We gonna show'em how we do it.

586
00:34:49.434 --> 00:34:51.202
I'm Yung Semore. Yeah!

587
00:34:51.203 --> 00:34:53.103
Hold up. No, no, no.

588
00:34:53.104 --> 00:34:55.173
Hold on, hold on.
What you doing, girl?


589
00:34:55.174 --> 00:34:56.640
- What?
- What are you doing?


590
00:34:56.641 --> 00:34:58.942
Look, girl, when you

591
00:34:58.943 --> 00:35:00.678
I need that ass clappin'.

592
00:35:00.679 --> 00:35:02.580
You know what I mean?

593
00:35:02.581 --> 00:35:04.315
All right, look.

594
00:35:04.316 --> 00:35:06.917
Let me see. Come on.
Line that ass up.


595
00:35:06.918 --> 00:35:08.852
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap!

596
00:35:08.853 --> 00:35:10.754
Come, clap it! Yeah.

597
00:35:10.755 --> 00:35:13.460
What I'm talking about.

598
00:35:14.559 --> 00:35:16.194
Damn, son!

599
00:35:16.195 --> 00:35:19.497
Keep that ass in line.

600
00:35:19.498 --> 00:35:21.332
All right, let's go!

601
00:35:21.333 --> 00:35:23.470
DJ, spin it back.
Let's go, come on!


602
00:35:29.208 --> 00:35:30.907
- Hey, now.
- What?


603
00:35:30.908 --> 00:35:33.043
- Come on, girl.
- Baby, it's hot. Come on.


604
00:35:33.044 --> 00:35:35.112
- I need your help.
- Right now?


605
00:35:35.113 --> 00:35:38.115
Yeah, I gotta blow up
a couple balloons before the show.


606
00:35:38.116 --> 00:35:40.484
Don't you see me
cleaning this table?


607
00:35:40.485 --> 00:35:42.588
Baby, it's only a couple.

608
00:35:44.055 --> 00:35:45.390
Come on.

609
00:35:53.698 --> 00:35:55.367
Hold on, tiger.

610
00:35:56.968 --> 00:36:00.271
Yeah, baby.

611
00:36:00.272 --> 00:36:02.007
Damn!

612
00:36:11.283 --> 00:36:14.221
Yeah!

613
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.171
- This is shit, man!
- How's everything?


614
00:36:34.172 --> 00:36:36.473
I finally got them down here.

615
00:36:36.474 --> 00:36:38.542
This a no-star hotel.

616
00:36:38.543 --> 00:36:40.678
Is that him?

617
00:36:40.679 --> 00:36:42.813
I think that's Jeezy right
there, girl.


618
00:36:42.814 --> 00:36:45.385
I think I can see
the tattoo on his neck.


619
00:36:46.217 --> 00:36:47.884
Double-R Incorporated.
Russell Redds.


620
00:36:47.885 --> 00:36:49.386
What's this bullshit, Russell?

621
00:36:49.387 --> 00:36:50.621
What you mean?

622
00:36:50.622 --> 00:36:52.623
We supposed to get
a five-star hotel,


623
00:36:52.624 --> 00:36:55.392
like the Hyatt Regency,
Doubletree, something classy.


624
00:36:55.393 --> 00:36:57.127
I can't even get dude
out the van.


625
00:36:57.128 --> 00:37:00.397
I know that. I know you all
were supposed to be over at the Hyatt,


626
00:37:00.398 --> 00:37:02.466
but when I called
they was all sold out,


627
00:37:02.467 --> 00:37:05.502
and over at that Doubletree,
they got that police...


628
00:37:05.503 --> 00:37:07.504
They got some kind
of police convention.


629
00:37:07.505 --> 00:37:09.673
- Retirement party.
- You don't wanna go there.


630
00:37:09.674 --> 00:37:12.676
I know y'all be doing your thing
and don't wanna be over there.


631
00:37:12.677 --> 00:37:16.179
This right here, the Cloud G,
is actually one of the best hotels...


632
00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.581
in Modesto.

633
00:37:17.582 --> 00:37:19.416
Me and Jellyroll stay here
all the time.


634
00:37:19.417 --> 00:37:20.951
I got married here, man.

635
00:37:20.952 --> 00:37:23.354
And we got you that discount rate
I was talking about.


636
00:37:23.355 --> 00:37:26.123
Yeah, 'cause Martin Luther King
probably got shot here.


637
00:37:26.124 --> 00:37:28.925
You know what, a nigger
named King Luther got shot


638
00:37:28.926 --> 00:37:30.694
up there in 313 one night.

639
00:37:30.695 --> 00:37:32.929
Some shit jumped out,
got real ugly...


640
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:36.199
You know what, man?
I'm calling the Hyatt.


641
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.602
- You're wasting your time.
- I think that's him.


642
00:37:38.603 --> 00:37:40.738
I wanna let him beat on this box.

643
00:37:40.739 --> 00:37:41.972
Shit!

644
00:37:41.973 --> 00:37:43.874
I like that little one right there.

645
00:37:43.875 --> 00:37:47.378
With the big old booty?
I guess, if that's what you like.


646
00:37:47.379 --> 00:37:48.646
They're overpriced,

647
00:37:48.647 --> 00:37:51.349
and they didn't have
the presidential suite you asked for.


648
00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:53.617
You saying they have my suite?

649
00:37:53.618 --> 00:37:55.986
No, they didn't have your suite.
They got it over here.


650
00:37:55.987 --> 00:37:58.321
- They got the Jacuzzi...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!


651
00:37:58.322 --> 00:38:00.724
We'll talk about that later, okay?

652
00:38:00.725 --> 00:38:03.460
- What we need to do is get the keys...
- Gonna get the keys...


653
00:38:03.461 --> 00:38:07.197
We're gonna get the keys,
and I get him to his room,


654
00:38:07.198 --> 00:38:10.066
- 'cause he's tired, you know.
- Do what you're gonna do, man.


655
00:38:10.067 --> 00:38:12.202
Shut the fuck up.
I'm talking to Russell.


656
00:38:12.203 --> 00:38:13.871
This nigger think I'm the driver?

657
00:38:13.872 --> 00:38:16.039
Make sure I get
that presidential suite ASAP.


658
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.075
- I'll get you the presidential suite.
- With a Jacuzzi?


659
00:38:19.076 --> 00:38:20.977
- I hooked you up.
- That's what's up.


660
00:38:20.978 --> 00:38:22.582
Help me with the bags, please.

661
00:38:24.449 --> 00:38:27.284
That nigger act like he got
an album coming out.


662
00:38:27.285 --> 00:38:30.987
The road managers,
they prima donnas.


663
00:38:30.988 --> 00:38:32.923
- You ovulating?
- Yes, I am!


664
00:38:32.924 --> 00:38:34.925
Girl, me too, girl.
We gonna get paid.


665
00:38:34.926 --> 00:38:38.165
Now, fix your titties.
Yeah, let's do this.


666
00:39:05.557 --> 00:39:07.827
Hell, no, man.

667
00:39:15.299 --> 00:39:16.967
Fuck!

668
00:39:16.968 --> 00:39:20.073
Be having bottles!

669
00:39:22.273 --> 00:39:23.608
Shit.

670
00:39:26.445 --> 00:39:28.581
Thank you, Jeezy, for going platinum.

671
00:39:31.716 --> 00:39:33.485
Let me call the man.

672
00:39:34.686 --> 00:39:36.720
How your room?

673
00:39:36.721 --> 00:39:39.457
<i>It's crazy in here.
What do you mean, how's my room?</i>


674
00:39:39.458 --> 00:39:41.658
My shit whack too, dog.
Yeah, dreadful.


675
00:39:41.659 --> 00:39:43.994
<i>- Let's go to sound check.
- Yeah, okay.</i>


676
00:39:43.995 --> 00:39:46.129
I'm gonna check on that
and hit you back.


677
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.466
Hurry up, man.
Got a fucked-up room.


678
00:39:48.467 --> 00:39:51.839
- Don't trip, man. My shit whack too.
- Let's go to the ventte,


679
00:39:54.572 --> 00:39:56.774
Aw, yeah.

680
00:39:56.775 --> 00:39:58.945
Me likey.

681
00:40:02.847 --> 00:40:04.848
Wanna go to the room?

682
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:07.050
Ha! Yeah. Sweet.

683
00:40:07.051 --> 00:40:08.952
Yeah, that's how we do it.

684
00:40:08.953 --> 00:40:11.922
I spent a grip over at Gino's
on the way here.


685
00:40:11.923 --> 00:40:14.090
You need to go to the mall.

686
00:40:14.091 --> 00:40:17.327
You're probably gonna wear
that ugly-ass Kurt Franklin suit.


687
00:40:17.328 --> 00:40:19.830
They threw my son's CD
out the window?


688
00:40:19.831 --> 00:40:21.865
Slung that out the window
like a Frisbee.


689
00:40:21.866 --> 00:40:23.366
I thought a dog was gonna
catch it.


690
00:40:23.367 --> 00:40:26.202
Catch that motherfucker
in the air.


691
00:40:26.203 --> 00:40:29.209
But, no, I was mad too,
but don't worry about the CD.


692
00:40:30.341 --> 00:40:32.810
This is what you need to
worry about.


693
00:40:32.811 --> 00:40:35.883
Two Gs. Gator!

694
00:40:37.481 --> 00:40:41.217
That's them preachers be tricking
them bitches in church with.


695
00:40:41.218 --> 00:40:43.320
That's something special.
That ain't shit.


696
00:40:43.321 --> 00:40:45.488
That ain't shit.

697
00:40:45.489 --> 00:40:47.324
You need to look at 13 Gs.

698
00:40:47.325 --> 00:40:50.894
I'm gonna kill 'em tonight, baby.
I'm-a kill... whoo!


699
00:40:50.895 --> 00:40:54.097
Damn! That's the showstopper,
right there.


700
00:40:54.098 --> 00:40:57.100
Precision.

701
00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:58.902
You need to get
your shit together.


702
00:40:58.903 --> 00:41:01.104
- I need to get my shit together?
- Yeah.


703
00:41:01.105 --> 00:41:03.206
I'm the one who taught
you the game, boy.


704
00:41:03.207 --> 00:41:06.877
You might be able to out-dress me,
but never to out-think me.


705
00:41:06.878 --> 00:41:08.579
Understand that, now.

706
00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.014
I don't know where
you borrowed that money from,


707
00:41:11.015 --> 00:41:13.516
but I don't want no bullshit
at the venue tonight.


708
00:41:13.517 --> 00:41:16.119
I come from money.
I've had money all my life.


709
00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.556
Looky here, man. Whoever you
borrowed that money from


710
00:41:19.557 --> 00:41:22.295
gonna be bugging the shit
outta me to get paid.


711
00:41:24.362 --> 00:41:28.031
What's up, Russell?
You taking us to sound check?


712
00:41:28.032 --> 00:41:29.600
Yeah, let's go.

713
00:41:29.601 --> 00:41:31.368
All right, man, get your driver.

714
00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:34.270
Driver? You better be in a car seat
when you get in that van,


715
00:41:34.271 --> 00:41:36.542
little Gary Coleman-looking
motherfucker.


716
00:41:56.127 --> 00:41:57.897
Clean that good, girl.

717
00:42:05.369 --> 00:42:08.471
Mike check. Mike check one.

718
00:42:08.472 --> 00:42:10.573
Mike check mo.

719
00:42:10.574 --> 00:42:12.342
One, mo, check.

720
00:42:12.343 --> 00:42:14.380
Y'all got that?

721
00:42:24.656 --> 00:42:27.060
Mike check one, mike check mo.

722
00:42:31.262 --> 00:42:32.796
Russell Redds.

723
00:42:32.797 --> 00:42:36.133
- Goddamn.
- Just the guy I wanted to see.


724
00:42:36.134 --> 00:42:38.001
Where's my money?

725
00:42:38.002 --> 00:42:41.038
Man, I got your little
funky-ass $G500.


726
00:42:41.039 --> 00:42:44.107
- 9500. Don't get cute with me.
- Whatever, man.


727
00:42:44.108 --> 00:42:46.076
I'll meet your greedy ass
in the office.


728
00:42:46.077 --> 00:42:48.080
Trying to handle this
goddamn show.


729
00:42:49.147 --> 00:42:52.653
No cash, the house
doesn't open, all right?


730
00:42:53.751 --> 00:42:55.852
Gonna take a whipping tonight,
boy!


731
00:42:55.853 --> 00:42:58.291
- Whatever, man.
- You're going down, baby.


732
00:42:59.256 --> 00:43:01.925
Yeah, your daddy want
his hat back.


733
00:43:01.926 --> 00:43:03.528
Motherfucker.

734
00:43:06.931 --> 00:43:09.800
On the seats.
You understand me?


735
00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:13.741
Do you feel me? 
Do you feel me?

736
00:43:15.372 --> 00:43:17.273
Look, Jeezy,
just give me a second.


737
00:43:17.274 --> 00:43:19.109
Bring my Hennessey back.

738
00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.711
I got you covered.

739
00:43:20.712 --> 00:43:22.713
Damn! About to lose my job.

740
00:43:22.714 --> 00:43:25.115
Man, how you not gonna have
no Popeye's chicken,


741
00:43:25.116 --> 00:43:26.783
no potato salad, no Hennessey?

742
00:43:26.784 --> 00:43:29.219
If it's a rap show,
you gotta have Hennessey, man!


743
00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.854
Who are these goddamn promoters?

744
00:43:30.855 --> 00:43:33.556
Don't they know I've been
working with the best of them?


745
00:43:33.557 --> 00:43:36.226
I can't pay all of them.
I'll pay your light bill.


746
00:43:36.227 --> 00:43:38.264
- At least you'll have...
- Jellyroll!


747
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:42.665
All right, I'm gonna holler
at you in a minute.


748
00:43:42.666 --> 00:43:44.469
Up top, baby.

749
00:43:46.237 --> 00:43:47.672
See you later.

750
00:43:49.673 --> 00:43:52.275
- I need to holla at you.
- What's up?


751
00:43:52.276 --> 00:43:54.945
Hey, brother,
I need to talk to you, man.


752
00:43:54.946 --> 00:43:56.579
- What's up?
- Wait a minute!


753
00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.082
Russ, what you need, man?

754
00:43:59.083 --> 00:44:01.184
Hold on, Jellyroll.
Let me hear what he got to say.


755
00:44:01.185 --> 00:44:03.754
Hold up, Russell. I think your
partner got a problem with me.


756
00:44:03.755 --> 00:44:05.122
Yeah, you thinkin' right.

757
00:44:05.123 --> 00:44:07.423
He the one that threw
your son's CD out the window.


758
00:44:07.424 --> 00:44:09.192
- What?
- Him. Don't lie.


759
00:44:09.193 --> 00:44:12.095
- Are you lying to me?
- What happened was...


760
00:44:12.096 --> 00:44:14.430
- When we was in the car, and...
- You lying.


761
00:44:14.431 --> 00:44:16.391
You look like a lying motherfucker.
What you want?


762
00:44:18.002 --> 00:44:20.003
I don't know what's happening here,

763
00:44:20.004 --> 00:44:21.772
but I'm focused on what we need,

764
00:44:21.773 --> 00:44:24.574
and that's that Hennessey
in the dressing room ASAP.


765
00:44:24.575 --> 00:44:25.909
Get the fuck outta here.

766
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.845
Can't you see us having
this conversation about the show?


767
00:44:28.846 --> 00:44:32.082
- You talkin' about some Hennessey?
- Liquor, man? What the fuck...


768
00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:33.750
I'll talk to you in a minute.

769
00:44:33.751 --> 00:44:35.185
Scram.

770
00:44:35.186 --> 00:44:38.521
You know what? Fuck it.
No Hennessey, no show.


771
00:44:38.522 --> 00:44:40.390
Ain't got time for this shit.

772
00:44:40.391 --> 00:44:44.194
Now, that's what Jeezy said.

773
00:44:44.195 --> 00:44:46.462
You know, I mean,
I'm just the messenger.


774
00:44:46.463 --> 00:44:50.000
If I was the rapper, I'd say,
"Can we have a Hennessey, please,"


775
00:44:50.001 --> 00:44:52.769
'cause that's what's on the rider.

776
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:56.206
You tell that motherfucker Jeezy
that we'll think about it.


777
00:44:56.207 --> 00:44:57.542
Yeah.

778
00:44:58.442 --> 00:45:00.779
Okay, thanks.

779
00:45:02.346 --> 00:45:04.147
- Hey, Percy.
- What?


780
00:45:04.148 --> 00:45:06.783
Don't forget where you at, man.

781
00:45:06.784 --> 00:45:08.484
You in M
-Do now.

782
00:45:08.485 --> 00:45:10.320
The 2O9, punk.

783
00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:12.089
What's that supposed to mean?

784
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:14.490
Look, I'm about to go pay Glanville.

785
00:45:14.491 --> 00:45:17.027
I need you to steal
that money back, okay?


786
00:45:17.028 --> 00:45:19.966
All right, look,
here's what we gonna do.


787
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:26.903
Count this shit faster, man.

788
00:45:26.904 --> 00:45:28.404
Hey, you know what?

789
00:45:28.405 --> 00:45:30.473
Let me take my time here,
all right?


790
00:45:30.474 --> 00:45:31.809
Jeez.

791
00:45:32.643 --> 00:45:34.878
Five... 9,OOO.

792
00:45:34.879 --> 00:45:36.746
Have a seat, Russell.

793
00:45:36.747 --> 00:45:38.181
I'd rather stand.

794
00:45:38.182 --> 00:45:41.417
Whatever you want, bro,
but you don't look too good.


795
00:45:41.418 --> 00:45:43.253
Forgot to bring my medicine.

796
00:45:43.254 --> 00:45:46.422
- You know I'm a diabetic, right?
- No, I didn't know that,


797
00:45:46.423 --> 00:45:50.026
but I do know that you suck
at being a promoter.


798
00:45:50.027 --> 00:45:52.195
I don't want to hurt
your feelings or nothing.


799
00:45:52.196 --> 00:45:54.597
You're not gonna make it.
It's not gonna happen.


800
00:45:54.598 --> 00:45:56.532
Look, man, some
of our shows worked.


801
00:45:56.533 --> 00:45:57.800
Give us some credit.

802
00:45:57.801 --> 00:46:00.637
But most of your shows
do not make money,


803
00:46:00.638 --> 00:46:03.874
because you and Jelly Rat
don't know what you're doing.


804
00:46:03.875 --> 00:46:06.343
- Jellyroll.
- Jellyroll, whatever.


805
00:46:06.344 --> 00:46:08.678
What the hell's wrong with you,
man?


806
00:46:08.679 --> 00:46:11.681
You all right, brother?

807
00:46:11.682 --> 00:46:13.283
We have to call my woman.

808
00:46:13.284 --> 00:46:15.285
She got to...!

809
00:46:15.286 --> 00:46:18.391
Hey. Hey, Russell! Russell!

810
00:46:20.124 --> 00:46:22.392
Russell! Russell. Russell.

811
00:46:22.393 --> 00:46:23.960
Russell, what's up, man?

812
00:46:23.961 --> 00:46:26.129
It's me, Johnny... hey!

813
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:29.266
I need help here!
I need... Russell, hey!


814
00:46:29.267 --> 00:46:32.902
I need help! Shit! I need help!

815
00:46:32.903 --> 00:46:36.406
Hey, Boyer! Got an emergency!

816
00:46:36.407 --> 00:46:39.746
Boyer! Boyer!

817
00:46:40.978 --> 00:46:43.079
No!
What the hell is going on?


818
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.481
- Dear son of...
- Get the money!


819
00:46:45.482 --> 00:46:47.350
Get the fucking money!

820
00:46:47.351 --> 00:46:49.085
Don't let him see.

821
00:46:49.086 --> 00:46:51.257
Hey! Put that shit in your pocket.

822
00:46:53.424 --> 00:46:56.359
Anybody seen Russell
around here?


823
00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.361
He's having a seizure. Hold on!

824
00:46:58.362 --> 00:47:00.263
Having a seizure where?

825
00:47:00.264 --> 00:47:02.232
Hell, no!

826
00:47:02.233 --> 00:47:04.567
No! What'd you do to my man?

827
00:47:04.568 --> 00:47:08.308
- I didn't do shit.
- Russell Redds! Russell Redds!


828
00:47:09.173 --> 00:47:10.907
- He's asleep.
- He's snoring.


829
00:47:10.908 --> 00:47:13.576
Yeah. See, when he have a seizure,
that's what he do.


830
00:47:13.577 --> 00:47:16.946
He usually just go to sleep.
He's out of it.


831
00:47:16.947 --> 00:47:18.781
Just leave him alone.
He's cool, yeah.


832
00:47:18.782 --> 00:47:20.583
Want me to call the paramedics?

833
00:47:20.584 --> 00:47:23.720
Get him a Capri Sun.
That's what he'll usually use.


834
00:47:23.721 --> 00:47:26.356
A Capri Sun? What the fuck?

835
00:47:26.357 --> 00:47:29.859
Russell Redds! Wake up, Russ.

836
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:31.194
- Wake up.
- I'm good.


837
00:47:31.195 --> 00:47:33.296
Wake up. Right! He's up.

838
00:47:33.297 --> 00:47:35.300
My boy, he's up.

839
00:47:37.368 --> 00:47:39.302
You scared the shit outta me.

840
00:47:39.303 --> 00:47:40.870
You don't need a doctor or nothing?

841
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:44.307
Everything's cool, baby.
He cool.


842
00:47:44.308 --> 00:47:46.309
I'm-a call his mother
when I leave.


843
00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:48.911
See if she'll come pick him up.
We gotta go, man.


844
00:47:48.912 --> 00:47:51.481
Hold it a second!

845
00:47:51.482 --> 00:47:53.149
What the hell happened
to my money?


846
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.617
What money?

847
00:47:54.618 --> 00:47:56.286
Pat 'em down, boys.

848
00:47:56.287 --> 00:47:57.522
Don't touch me.

849
00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:02.825
I don't know where that
come from.


850
00:48:02.826 --> 00:48:04.929
You're goddamn geniuses?

851
00:48:06.097 --> 00:48:08.731
The only reason you mo
are walking out of here alive


852
00:48:08.732 --> 00:48:11.101
is because the show must go on.

853
00:48:11.102 --> 00:48:14.337
Because if it doesn't
and those monkeys in there


854
00:48:14.338 --> 00:48:17.974
<i>ruin my beautiful theatre,
ay, mamacita.</i>


855
00:48:17.975 --> 00:48:20.076
Just give 'em a little bit
of appetizer.


856
00:48:20.077 --> 00:48:21.480
What's appetizer?

857
00:48:23.247 --> 00:48:25.584
Come on, man! Motherfucker!

858
00:48:28.252 --> 00:48:29.486
Shit!

859
00:48:29.487 --> 00:48:31.121
- Damn!
- Goddamn.


860
00:48:31.122 --> 00:48:33.256
I knew that bullshit
wasn't gonna work, man!


861
00:48:33.257 --> 00:48:35.925
It would've worked if you'd
just came and got the money


862
00:48:35.926 --> 00:48:37.660
instead of trying
to get me off the ground.


863
00:48:37.661 --> 00:48:39.562
<i>What do you think you are,
Gray's Anatomy?</i>


864
00:48:39.563 --> 00:48:43.233
I didn't know your ass was
gonna be stretched out on the floor.


865
00:48:43.234 --> 00:48:46.236
Just have your half tonight.
Shit, I'm broke.


866
00:48:46.237 --> 00:48:50.740
Look, Jellyroll, it's imperative
you don't spend that money.


867
00:48:50.741 --> 00:48:52.875
This show gotta jump off, man.

868
00:48:52.876 --> 00:48:54.644
Our life might depend on it.

869
00:48:54.645 --> 00:48:55.812
Shit.

870
00:48:55.813 --> 00:48:57.747
Hit me in my motherfucking jaw.

871
00:48:57.748 --> 00:49:00.616
I ain't gonna be able to eat no pussy
for mo, three months now.


872
00:49:00.617 --> 00:49:02.855
I'm gonna have to eat me
some pussy like this.


873
00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.262
- Turn-down service.
- Come back later.


874
00:49:12.263 --> 00:49:14.264
I'll love the shit outta you.

875
00:49:14.265 --> 00:49:15.998
Babe, you gotta get up outta here.

876
00:49:15.999 --> 00:49:17.300
- Let's go.
- Baby.


877
00:49:17.301 --> 00:49:19.202
- No, no, no!
- Finally got a real rapper.


878
00:49:19.203 --> 00:49:22.372
What the fuck? Let go of me.
Hey, man, stop.


879
00:49:22.373 --> 00:49:24.341
Hold on, baby, I don't fuck
with the help.


880
00:49:24.342 --> 00:49:27.610
- Okay, okay. I'll give you some.
- I don't fuck around like that.


881
00:49:27.611 --> 00:49:29.045
Yes. Yes.

882
00:49:29.046 --> 00:49:30.980
You gotta go, baby. I got a show.

883
00:49:30.981 --> 00:49:33.051
I got a show tonight for you.

884
00:49:34.051 --> 00:49:36.152
I'm sorry! Is that your balls?
Let me kiss them.


885
00:49:36.153 --> 00:49:37.987
Come, man, don't fight it.

886
00:49:37.988 --> 00:49:40.656
I'm gonna fuck
the tattoos off of you, boy.


887
00:49:40.657 --> 00:49:43.726
What's wrong with you?
You allergic to pussy?


888
00:49:43.727 --> 00:49:47.166
This is good for you.
I'm gonna make your skin shine.


889
00:49:48.866 --> 00:49:50.800
Exactly!

890
00:49:50.801 --> 00:49:52.502
- There you go!
- You like that?


891
00:49:52.503 --> 00:49:55.238
Yeah, role play, baby. Role play.

892
00:49:55.239 --> 00:49:57.208
Ay yi yi!

893
00:49:58.376 --> 00:50:01.744
<i>- ;Mas mttcho!
- ;No mas! ;No mas!</i>


894
00:50:01.745 --> 00:50:04.947
I'm coming! I'm tired. I'm tired.

895
00:50:04.948 --> 00:50:06.716
Shut the fuck up and hit it!

896
00:50:06.717 --> 00:50:09.752
I done hit it with
everything I got, baby.


897
00:50:09.753 --> 00:50:11.823
Housekeeping.

898
00:50:12.956 --> 00:50:16.092
Lisa Williams,
what is going on in here?


899
00:50:16.093 --> 00:50:19.629
I told you to stop. Get off me!

900
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:22.698
Thank God you came.
I told him to stop.


901
00:50:22.699 --> 00:50:25.935
Did he? Come on, honey.
Let's go to security.


902
00:50:25.936 --> 00:50:27.637
You are an animal!

903
00:50:27.638 --> 00:50:29.138
Wait a minute.
That's not what happened.


904
00:50:29.139 --> 00:50:30.907
- Get back, you pervert!
- That burns!


905
00:50:30.908 --> 00:50:33.476
No, wait, you don't understand.
She lying.


906
00:50:33.477 --> 00:50:36.546
This is some bullshit.
She lying on me, man.


907
00:50:36.547 --> 00:50:38.147
I'm telling you,
she is lying on me.


908
00:50:38.148 --> 00:50:40.383
- What happened?
- Nothing.


909
00:50:40.384 --> 00:50:43.520
Miss Leonard caught us fucking
up in the presidential suite.


910
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:46.155
- I didn't want to lose my job, so...
- You didn't!


911
00:50:46.156 --> 00:50:47.657
- Call my lawyer!
- You know I did.


912
00:50:47.658 --> 00:50:50.493
Yo, Jeezy! Call my lawyer, man.

913
00:50:50.494 --> 00:50:53.095
His card in my bag.
He expecting your call.


914
00:50:53.096 --> 00:50:54.664
You know, the one
that got R. Kelly off.


915
00:50:54.665 --> 00:50:57.600
What al_e you gonna do?
You can't go through with this.


916
00:50:57.601 --> 00:50:59.669
Lisa, you lying! You liar!
You know you lying.


917
00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:01.671
I'm about to go finish my shift.

918
00:51:01.672 --> 00:51:04.807
Excuse me, ma'am. You're gonna
have to go with us to the hospital.


919
00:51:04.808 --> 00:51:06.075
For what?

920
00:51:06.076 --> 00:51:08.380
We have to run
some tests on you with our kit.


921
00:51:11.982 --> 00:51:13.849
This nigger Percy, he's crazy.

922
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:16.088
For real, he didn't learn
it from Kobe.


923
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:23.125
Peace out.
Don't eat the baloney sandwich, nig.


924
00:51:23.126 --> 00:51:25.564
We'll be down there
to get your dumb ass.


925
00:51:59.896 --> 00:52:02.865
Right about now,
coming to the stage,


926
00:52:02.866 --> 00:52:05.101
straight out of north Modesto!

927
00:52:05.102 --> 00:52:11.982
Make some noise for Yung Semore!

928
00:52:16.913 --> 00:52:19.986
And the crowd goes crazy.

929
00:52:30.427 --> 00:52:32.562
How do I look?

930
00:52:32.563 --> 00:52:34.296
You look good.

931
00:52:34.297 --> 00:52:37.269
Nigger, you ain't even look at me!

932
00:52:40.203 --> 00:52:41.672
Yes, I did.

933
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.211
Till death do us part, Geeny.

934
00:52:49.212 --> 00:52:51.650
Till death do us part.

935
00:53:07.531 --> 00:53:09.366
Show time!

936
00:53:42.232 --> 00:53:44.366
- Russell Redds.
- What up, man?


937
00:53:44.367 --> 00:53:46.035
Where the fuck is Jellyroll?

938
00:53:46.036 --> 00:53:47.570
I don't know.
Shit, I ain't seen him.


939
00:53:47.571 --> 00:53:49.505
I don't see his car
so he might not be here' yet.


940
00:53:49.506 --> 00:53:50.740
Y'all need some tickets?

941
00:53:50.741 --> 00:53:52.475
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll hook you up.


942
00:53:52.476 --> 00:53:54.677
He was supposed to leave us
some at the front desk.


943
00:53:54.678 --> 00:53:56.646
- What's up with that?
- It happened like that.


944
00:53:56.647 --> 00:53:58.247
He ain't here.
I'll hook y'all up.


945
00:53:58.248 --> 00:53:59.949
I want to know
what the fuck is going on,


946
00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:02.184
'cause I got some money
invested in the concert.


947
00:54:02.185 --> 00:54:04.687
- Wait, what did you say?
- Twenty Gs.


948
00:54:04.688 --> 00:54:07.256
You gave Jellyroll 20 Gs?

949
00:54:07.257 --> 00:54:10.296
Yeah, for Jeezy to show up
to my after party.


950
00:54:11.762 --> 00:54:13.429
That's up.

951
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:15.865
Man, I ain't seen him all day.

952
00:54:15.866 --> 00:54:19.101
Didn't you send Jellyroll to
my house to cop some weed?


953
00:54:19.102 --> 00:54:21.804
- I don't recall that.
- Well, recall this.


954
00:54:21.805 --> 00:54:24.106
That's when I gave
his ass the money.


955
00:54:24.107 --> 00:54:25.341
Okay.

956
00:54:25.342 --> 00:54:27.777
Now go see about
my backstage pass.


957
00:54:27.778 --> 00:54:30.012
Wait a minute, you said
you wanted tickets.


958
00:54:30.013 --> 00:54:33.315
Now I want backstage passes,
since I'm a partner.


959
00:54:33.316 --> 00:54:35.151
We partners, dog.

960
00:54:35.152 --> 00:54:36.719
Goddamn, Mondo.

961
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.022
You see that I'm short, man.
It's thin out here.


962
00:54:40.023 --> 00:54:42.124
- How many you need?
- Twenty-seven.


963
00:54:42.125 --> 00:54:45.495
Twenty...? Just wait here. Shit.

964
00:54:45.496 --> 00:54:47.966
- Wait here!
- Hurry up.


965
00:54:48.799 --> 00:54:51.834
Hey, hey, anybody seen Jellyroll?

966
00:54:51.835 --> 00:54:53.969
Paco! You seen Jellyroll?

967
00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:55.406
No, man.

968
00:55:07.117 --> 00:55:11.253
<i>What up, bitches? It's your boy Percy.
Call a motherfuckers back, Holla.</i>


969
00:55:11.254 --> 00:55:12.488
Hey, hey, man, Percy.

970
00:55:12.489 --> 00:55:15.958
Goddamn is filling up over here
and I ain't heard from none of y'all.


971
00:55:15.959 --> 00:55:19.361
Okay, this is my third time calling,
and I ain't heard nothing, bro.


972
00:55:19.362 --> 00:55:22.331
Call me back, please.
Russell. Please.


973
00:55:22.332 --> 00:55:24.466
Brother, please, call me back.

974
00:55:24.467 --> 00:55:27.840
All right, I ain't heard nothing, okay?
I need to hear from you ASAP.


975
00:55:35.345 --> 00:55:37.647
Man. What?

976
00:55:37.648 --> 00:55:39.649
Hey! Who the hell y'all with?

977
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.283
Semore.

978
00:55:41.284 --> 00:55:43.252
Bullshit. Semore invited all y'all?

979
00:55:43.253 --> 00:55:45.221
- Yes.
- Where the hell is he?


980
00:55:45.222 --> 00:55:46.689
Over there.

981
00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:48.958
Hey, y'all better have
backstage passes.


982
00:55:48.959 --> 00:55:50.927
Everybody better have a pass.

983
00:55:50.928 --> 00:55:55.569
Free tickets for every goddamn
body up in this building.


984
00:55:57.467 --> 00:55:59.635
Hey, Nick, get your big ass
out the way.


985
00:55:59.636 --> 00:56:01.270
Where you think you going?

986
00:56:01.271 --> 00:56:04.640
I'm Russell Redds, the promoter.
That's my son in there!


987
00:56:04.641 --> 00:56:08.014
That may be true, but you can't
enter until he says it's okay.


988
00:56:13.083 --> 00:56:14.817
So wait here.

989
00:56:14.818 --> 00:56:16.988
I know your uncle too!

990
00:56:17.721 --> 00:56:19.056
Yo!

991
00:56:20.557 --> 00:56:21.991
He's getting a massage.
What you want?


992
00:56:21.992 --> 00:56:24.927
Dollar, it's me.
Hey, yo, Semore!


993
00:56:24.928 --> 00:56:26.931
Your pop's out here.

994
00:56:30.133 --> 00:56:33.836
Yo, Russell, there's this guy
standing out there named Mondo.


995
00:56:33.837 --> 00:56:37.607
Don't let him in, all right?
Just tell him I'm working on it.


996
00:56:37.608 --> 00:56:39.508
Thanks.

997
00:56:39.509 --> 00:56:40.676
Thank you.

998
00:56:40.677 --> 00:56:42.812
Gotta pat you down first.

999
00:56:42.813 --> 00:56:44.850
Are you serious?

1000
00:56:46.082 --> 00:56:48.654
That motherfucker ain't
even famous!


1001
00:56:51.688 --> 00:56:54.924
Semore! Hey, man,
did you hear me calling you?


1002
00:56:54.925 --> 00:56:56.859
What the hell's going
on around here?


1003
00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:59.595
What you mean what's going on?
These are all my people.


1004
00:56:59.596 --> 00:57:01.397
We kicking it. 
It's show time.

1005
00:57:01.398 --> 00:57:05.234
You got bodyguards, entourage.
There's strippers in there.


1006
00:57:05.235 --> 00:57:08.838
There's motherfuckers that didn't pay.
That's coming out your money.


1007
00:57:08.839 --> 00:57:10.372
You getting a massage?
What's going on!


1008
00:57:10.373 --> 00:57:12.107
Don't worry about nothing, Pops.

1009
00:57:12.108 --> 00:57:15.044
I heard that Puffy,
Jay-Z, and Andre 3,OOO


1010
00:57:15.045 --> 00:57:17.479
get at least four
or five massages a week.


1011
00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.548
That's just how us rappers do.

1012
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:23.352
Are you crazy? Nigger, they rich!
They got money.


1013
00:57:23.353 --> 00:57:24.787
You ain't got nothing.

1014
00:57:24.788 --> 00:57:27.122
I got talent.
That's all the money I need.


1015
00:57:27.123 --> 00:57:29.558
- Are you high?
- No, I ain't high.


1016
00:57:29.559 --> 00:57:31.193
- Havee you been drinking?
- No.


1017
00:57:31.194 --> 00:57:34.129
Look here, man, don't play
with me with that talent shit.


1018
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:37.399
I done told you already,
talent don't make money.


1019
00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.535
Money make money.

1020
00:57:39.536 --> 00:57:41.170
- I got you.
- Okay?


1021
00:57:41.171 --> 00:57:42.972
All right, man,
but forget about that.


1022
00:57:42.973 --> 00:57:44.974
Look here, man,
how many songs can you do?


1023
00:57:44.975 --> 00:57:47.642
I got six albums' worth
of rhymes. Why?


1024
00:57:47.643 --> 00:57:49.779
I need you to go on there
and do more than 20 minutes.


1025
00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:52.782
I got it. I can go all night
if you need me to, just like Kanye.


1026
00:57:52.783 --> 00:57:55.617
Look, I'm Yung Semore,
the crowd wanna see more,


1027
00:57:55.618 --> 00:57:58.354
and they fiendin' for it,
I'm-a let 'em see more!


1028
00:57:58.355 --> 00:58:01.156
Hey, yo, Big D.
Can you escort my dad outta here?


1029
00:58:01.157 --> 00:58:03.592
You don't let nobody in here
without my approval.


1030
00:58:03.593 --> 00:58:07.834
Nigga, nobody want to listen to me.
They'll learn. I'll start firing people.


1031
00:58:15.005 --> 00:58:18.140
I still don't understand why we
had to park so far down the street.


1032
00:58:18.141 --> 00:58:19.375
'Cause I'm the promoter.

1033
00:58:19.376 --> 00:58:22.211
I don't want nobody to see me
pulling up in that Rent-a-Van.


1034
00:58:22.212 --> 00:58:24.613
Regina...

1035
00:58:24.614 --> 00:58:26.281
I'm Jellyroll Entertainment,

1036
00:58:26.282 --> 00:58:29.585
<i>and you looking like one of the
girls off The Flava of Love,</i>


1037
00:58:29.586 --> 00:58:31.120
We gonna settle this right now.

1038
00:58:31.121 --> 00:58:34.627
It's your husband!

1039
00:58:36.126 --> 00:58:37.561
Get down.

1040
00:58:44.467 --> 00:58:46.635
Come on, girl, run!

1041
00:58:46.636 --> 00:58:48.570
I'm running. I'm running!

1042
00:58:48.571 --> 00:58:52.808
Regina, I love you, baby.

1043
00:58:52.809 --> 00:58:56.178
It's me. Yeah, it's me.

1044
00:58:56.179 --> 00:58:59.882
Don't kill him! I'm sorry!

1045
00:58:59.883 --> 00:59:03.152
Baby, come back! Please!

1046
00:59:03.153 --> 00:59:06.022
I just want to cuddle. Come on!

1047
00:59:06.023 --> 00:59:07.925
Come back! Stop!

1048
00:59:13.063 --> 00:59:16.165
Going down. Yung Semore's
in the building.


1049
00:59:16.166 --> 00:59:19.635
I'm feeling good, I'm looking good,
and I'm smelling wonderful.


1050
00:59:19.636 --> 00:59:21.272
Yo, all right!

1051
00:59:22.839 --> 00:59:25.274
- Tear it up.
- You ready, man?


1052
00:59:25.275 --> 00:59:27.009
I don't know, Dad, man.

1053
00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:29.011
I don't think I'm ready.

1054
00:59:29.012 --> 00:59:31.513
All them people out there,
I don't know if they're feeling me.


1055
00:59:31.514 --> 00:59:34.683
What happened to all that swagger
you had in the dressing room?


1056
00:59:34.684 --> 00:59:36.685
I learned that from 50 Cent.

1057
00:59:36.686 --> 00:59:39.354
Look, man, you can
name every rapper


1058
00:59:39.355 --> 00:59:42.424
and what they had for breakfast,
but what about you?


1059
00:59:42.425 --> 00:59:45.194
Man, you can't be no regurgitated MC!

1060
00:59:45.195 --> 00:59:47.596
You got to be an original.

1061
00:59:47.597 --> 00:59:51.733
The people, they want
an original, all right?


1062
00:59:51.734 --> 00:59:55.237
Now, you Yung Semore, right?
Modesto's finest, right?


1063
00:59:55.238 --> 00:59:56.973
Well, then act like it.

1064
00:59:56.974 --> 01:00:01.677
I'm-a go out there and announce
that Yung Semore's in the house


1065
01:00:01.678 --> 01:00:05.714
and he about to tear
this motherfucker up, right?


1066
01:00:05.715 --> 01:00:07.449
- Right.
- Right?


1067
01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:09.318
- You ready?
- I'm ready.


1068
01:00:09.319 --> 01:00:12.121
Stop acting like a bitch
and come on. Hit it.


1069
01:00:12.122 --> 01:00:13.889
Ready on the curtain and a spot.

1070
01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:17.059
All right, remember what I told you?
Clap, clap, clap.


1071
01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:20.062
Hey, now. Yo, yo.
What's up, Modesto!


1072
01:00:20.063 --> 01:00:21.998
How y'all doing?

1073
01:00:21.999 --> 01:00:24.066
Not this nigger again.

1074
01:00:24.067 --> 01:00:26.237
Are you all ready to see
Young Jeezy?


1075
01:00:27.904 --> 01:00:30.305
Yeah, before we bring out Jeezy,

1076
01:00:30.306 --> 01:00:33.209
I'd like to say that this show
was brought to you


1077
01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:35.810
by Russell Redds, Incorporated,

1078
01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:39.248
in conjunction with
Jellyroll Entertainment,


1079
01:00:39.249 --> 01:00:41.150
and you know we bring
the finest show...


1080
01:00:41.151 --> 01:00:44.653
- Fuck that!
- Hey, man, be nice.


1081
01:00:44.654 --> 01:00:46.788
None of that bullshit, Modesto.

1082
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:49.591
Don't embarrass me up here, now.
Don't embarrass me.


1083
01:00:49.592 --> 01:00:52.694
Before we bring out Young Jeezy,
I got a treat for you all.


1084
01:00:52.695 --> 01:00:54.096
Y'all know who he is.

1085
01:00:54.097 --> 01:00:57.033
Y'all done seen him since he
was yea high to a horsefly.


1086
01:00:57.034 --> 01:01:00.602
He better than Jay-Z,
he better than Little Wang


1087
01:01:00.603 --> 01:01:02.872
and Kanye West put together.

1088
01:01:02.873 --> 01:01:07.076
Y'all give it up for my son,
Yung Semore!


1089
01:01:07.077 --> 01:01:09.214
Give it up! Give it up!

1090
01:01:15.418 --> 01:01:17.753
Let's go.

1091
01:01:17.754 --> 01:01:20.459
Jeezy down in the building.

1092
01:01:22.292 --> 01:01:24.459
What's happening, Modesto?

1093
01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.628
I go by the name of Yung Semore.

1094
01:01:26.629 --> 01:01:30.099
Make some noise for me. Yeah!

1095
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.735
We're gonna do it like this.

1096
01:01:41.144 --> 01:01:42.644
How's everything going?

1097
01:01:42.645 --> 01:01:44.213
How the fuck you think, man?

1098
01:01:44.214 --> 01:01:46.148
Where you been?
Where the group?


1099
01:01:46.149 --> 01:01:48.150
I went up to the hotel.
They wasn't there.


1100
01:01:48.151 --> 01:01:49.884
Did you call?

1101
01:01:49.885 --> 01:01:52.588
I called up there.
I ain't get no answer.


1102
01:01:52.589 --> 01:01:55.327
Fuck it. Come on.

1103
01:02:06.636 --> 01:02:12.674
Hey, Percy, man, our reputation
in Modesto is in jeopardy as of now.


1104
01:02:12.675 --> 01:02:14.576
Okay, call me back, brother,
please.


1105
01:02:14.577 --> 01:02:17.313
Please, brother, please.
Call me back, brother, please.


1106
01:02:17.314 --> 01:02:18.981
Damn, why you didn't call me?

1107
01:02:18.982 --> 01:02:21.350
Man, Regina's trifling ass
came over there


1108
01:02:21.351 --> 01:02:25.287
and put it on me and had me
in the bed for about an hour.


1109
01:02:25.288 --> 01:02:26.521
Shit.

1110
01:02:26.522 --> 01:02:28.557
Okay, what time did you
get to the hotel?


1111
01:02:28.558 --> 01:02:30.626
OO, 9:30.

1112
01:02:30.627 --> 01:02:32.728
Look, I already see
where you're trying to go.


1113
01:02:32.729 --> 01:02:34.929
- It ain't my fault.
- It is your fault.


1114
01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:37.199
I don't know how,
but I know it's your fault.


1115
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.202
- Don't start.
- Why you bring Mondo into...?


1116
01:02:40.203 --> 01:02:44.106
Mondo wanted to invest
with Jellyroll Entertainment.


1117
01:02:44.107 --> 01:02:46.441
- Mondo?
- You just mad 'cause I got investors


1118
01:02:46.442 --> 01:02:48.677
and you ain't got none,
going on with all that.


1119
01:02:48.678 --> 01:02:51.147
Twenty Gs, dog?
You don't need 20 Gs!


1120
01:02:51.148 --> 01:02:56.285
Don't worry about the internal affairs
of Jellyroll Entertainment.


1121
01:02:56.286 --> 01:03:00.555
Like I said, all you need to worry
about is that Aruba money.


1122
01:03:00.556 --> 01:03:02.057
Stay out of my goddamn business.

1123
01:03:02.058 --> 01:03:04.926
Can I ask you just one thing,
FYI, okay, for your information,


1124
01:03:04.927 --> 01:03:07.163
- or just for my information.
- Come on with it.


1125
01:03:07.164 --> 01:03:10.632
How the hell you gonna get Jeezy
to show up at some after party


1126
01:03:10.633 --> 01:03:12.301
if he won't even show up
to our show?


1127
01:03:12.302 --> 01:03:14.469
You just stay out of my business.

1128
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:16.571
Just worry about that Aruba money.

1129
01:03:16.572 --> 01:03:20.914
Your business is my business!
Remember that!


1130
01:03:26.582 --> 01:03:30.357
Yeah, Yung Semore
in the building, baby.


1131
01:03:34.757 --> 01:03:36.991
No passes?

1132
01:03:36.992 --> 01:03:39.565
Dirty motherfuckers.

1133
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:43.402
Bitch, how much for 2T tickets?

1134
01:03:45.402 --> 01:03:48.270
Don't do this, Percy.
We got the people out here.


1135
01:03:48.271 --> 01:03:50.972
They waiting for Jeezy.
There ain't no Jeezy, man.


1136
01:03:50.973 --> 01:03:53.675
Call me back, man.
I'd really appreciate it, man.


1137
01:03:53.676 --> 01:03:56.278
It's Russell Redds.
Call me back, brother, please.


1138
01:03:56.279 --> 01:03:59.217
Please, brother, please.
Thank you.


1139
01:04:02.852 --> 01:04:04.522
I fucked up?

1140
01:04:07.157 --> 01:04:09.458
Yeah, you did.
That ain't business, man.


1141
01:04:09.459 --> 01:04:11.160
You should've handled business.

1142
01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:13.162
I know, I know.

1143
01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:14.763
- That ain't business.
- I know.


1144
01:04:14.764 --> 01:04:16.567
Damn, man.

1145
01:04:17.734 --> 01:04:19.301
There they are.

1146
01:04:19.302 --> 01:04:22.137
Hey, Jeezy, baby! Hot damn!

1147
01:04:22.138 --> 01:04:24.673
Look, man, you scared
the hell out of us.


1148
01:04:24.674 --> 01:04:26.641
Where you been?
Where Percy at?


1149
01:04:26.642 --> 01:04:28.977
Had a little situation
with my road manager, man.


1150
01:04:28.978 --> 01:04:30.712
Hey, man, fuck all that.

1151
01:04:30.713 --> 01:04:33.148
You were supposed to be on stage
about an hour ago.


1152
01:04:33.149 --> 01:04:34.383
You're very unprofessional.

1153
01:04:34.384 --> 01:04:37.286
Unprofessional? I'm here now,
nigger.


1154
01:04:37.287 --> 01:04:40.088
Gentlemen, we don't need that.
How much time you need?


1155
01:04:40.089 --> 01:04:43.161
Ten minutes. Hey, but where
the rest of that paper at?


1156
01:04:43.993 --> 01:04:46.661
Now, look, man.
You secure now.


1157
01:04:46.662 --> 01:04:50.499
We got your dough.
We ain't no small-time dudes.


1158
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.801
- Okay.
- We've been doing this a while.


1159
01:04:52.802 --> 01:04:55.003
We got your money.
You secure on that.


1160
01:04:55.004 --> 01:04:59.574
But I wanted to talk to Percy
because earlier, at sound check,


1161
01:04:59.575 --> 01:05:03.412
he promised me and Jellyroll
that we probably could get


1162
01:05:03.413 --> 01:05:06.681
a slight discount
if the house wasn't that full.


1163
01:05:06.682 --> 01:05:09.151
Now, look, we got a 3500-seater.

1164
01:05:09.152 --> 01:05:12.154
Now, it's only about 52T.

1165
01:05:12.155 --> 01:05:14.790
Something like that,
ballpark figure.


1166
01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:18.527
So I was just wondering
if that little discount still rang true.


1167
01:05:18.528 --> 01:05:20.629
You saying that to say what?

1168
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:23.865
I'm saying that, you know,
you got all these platinum plaques.


1169
01:05:23.866 --> 01:05:27.002
I thought you was bigger than that.
I thought you could fill the house.


1170
01:05:27.003 --> 01:05:29.838
I am bigger than that. Maybe
y'all should be better promoters.


1171
01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:32.374
And you're saying that to say what?

1172
01:05:32.375 --> 01:05:34.676
I'm saying it to say
I want my fucking money.


1173
01:05:34.677 --> 01:05:36.478
Let's roll, man.

1174
01:05:36.479 --> 01:05:38.547
We got your money.
That ain't shit.


1175
01:05:38.548 --> 01:05:40.282
Little old chump change.

1176
01:05:40.283 --> 01:05:43.385
Man, you ain't got to be
all hostile like that.


1177
01:05:43.386 --> 01:05:45.119
You have a nice show.

1178
01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.121
Yeah, have a nice show, brother.

1179
01:05:47.122 --> 01:05:50.396
You need to freeze some of that
meat on the back of your head.


1180
01:06:06.543 --> 01:06:07.909
Get off the stage!

1181
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:11.413
Somebody say yeah.

1182
01:06:11.414 --> 01:06:13.849
You see the look on that
motherfucker's face when I told him?


1183
01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:16.184
"I thought you
was bigger than that."


1184
01:06:16.185 --> 01:06:18.653
No, did you see
the look on your face


1185
01:06:18.654 --> 01:06:21.890
when he said that you was
a sorry-ass promoter?


1186
01:06:21.891 --> 01:06:24.092
You looked stupid
as a motherfucker.


1187
01:06:24.093 --> 01:06:26.731
Just give me the money
so we can pay these clowns.


1188
01:06:28.731 --> 01:06:32.166
I-I-i tried to tell you
when I pulled up, man.


1189
01:06:32.167 --> 01:06:34.636
I tried to tell you
when I pulled up.


1190
01:06:34.637 --> 01:06:37.506
Regina's husband tried
to run us over, man.


1191
01:06:37.507 --> 01:06:39.475
What's that got to do
with the money?


1192
01:06:39.476 --> 01:06:41.243
Look, I tried to offset it,

1193
01:06:41.244 --> 01:06:43.845
'cause I thought we was gonna
have a walk-up crowd.


1194
01:06:43.846 --> 01:06:46.882
You started yelling at me,
and then I messed up money.


1195
01:06:46.883 --> 01:06:50.652
Come on through.
What that got to do with anything?


1196
01:06:50.653 --> 01:06:53.455
What that got to do, man?
Look, look, look, don't tell me.


1197
01:06:53.456 --> 01:06:57.292
Don't tell me. Jellyroll,
do you have this man's money?


1198
01:06:57.293 --> 01:07:00.165
No, I don't have the money,
but...


1199
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:02.531
This watch.

1200
01:07:02.532 --> 01:07:05.367
Man! I don't give a goddamn
about that damn watch.


1201
01:07:05.368 --> 01:07:07.302
Lord, no...

1202
01:07:07.303 --> 01:07:09.605
Come on, man, the Lord ain't
got nothing to do with this.


1203
01:07:09.606 --> 01:07:10.839
Jesus Christ.

1204
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:14.242
Man, don't tell me you
gave up this man's money!


1205
01:07:14.243 --> 01:07:16.445
You know I mess up money
all the time!


1206
01:07:16.446 --> 01:07:17.679
That ain't business!

1207
01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.448
I've got a sickness, man!

1208
01:07:19.449 --> 01:07:22.216
That ain't business, man!
Goddamn!


1209
01:07:22.217 --> 01:07:24.520
Yo, what's popping?

1210
01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:26.123
After party.

1211
01:07:27.323 --> 01:07:29.393
Y'all ready for Young Jeezy?

1212
01:07:30.627 --> 01:07:33.732
You're gonna see
Yung Semore right now.


1213
01:07:37.199 --> 01:07:38.467
Yeah, what's up?

1214
01:07:38.468 --> 01:07:40.735
Yeah, man, we need to
holla at Jeezy.


1215
01:07:40.736 --> 01:07:42.438
Yo, it's the promoters.

1216
01:07:42.439 --> 01:07:44.041
Let 'em in.

1217
01:07:45.908 --> 01:07:47.809
I knew there had to be a mistake.

1218
01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:50.078
- What's happening?
- Hold on, hold on.


1219
01:07:50.079 --> 01:07:52.180
Yeah, right there.

1220
01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:55.417
<i>You got to treat a nigger like he's
on The Price Is Rightt or something?</i>


1221
01:07:55.418 --> 01:07:56.685
Damn, baby.

1222
01:07:56.686 --> 01:07:58.119
We good?

1223
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.622
Picnic-tablecloth-shirt-wearing
motherfucker.


1224
01:08:00.623 --> 01:08:02.857
- What's happening, baby?
- What's going on, man?


1225
01:08:02.858 --> 01:08:04.326
Show time, baby!

1226
01:08:04.327 --> 01:08:06.695
Modesto's finest?
What's up with it?


1227
01:08:06.696 --> 01:08:08.697
It's packed.
They ready for you, Jeezy.


1228
01:08:08.698 --> 01:08:11.933
- Bunch of bitches out there?
- I got one just for you.


1229
01:08:11.934 --> 01:08:14.102
- Okay, that's what's up.
- How much time you need?


1230
01:08:14.103 --> 01:08:15.637
About five minutes.
He tightened me up.


1231
01:08:15.638 --> 01:08:18.039
Okay, cool, just have
your people let me know.


1232
01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.575
I'm gonna be right there
by the stage. I'll bring you on.


1233
01:08:20.576 --> 01:08:23.779
That's cool, but let's take care
of this business. I got that paper.


1234
01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:26.047
I want to put it up anyway,
so let's get that.


1235
01:08:26.048 --> 01:08:28.450
We just need to get you
on that stage,


1236
01:08:28.451 --> 01:08:29.985
'cause it's a union building.

1237
01:08:29.986 --> 01:08:31.520
We get you on that stage,

1238
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:33.822
and I hit the box office
and check your receipts.


1239
01:08:33.823 --> 01:08:36.625
Receipts? Who y'all think
y'all dealing with?


1240
01:08:36.626 --> 01:08:39.394
Wait a minute, Jeezy,
don't insult us like that.


1241
01:08:39.395 --> 01:08:40.962
We done already took a loss.

1242
01:08:40.963 --> 01:08:43.264
You can't be a boss
until you take a loss.


1243
01:08:43.265 --> 01:08:44.566
Bottom line.

1244
01:08:44.567 --> 01:08:47.168
That's on y'all.
That's your fault, not mine.


1245
01:08:47.169 --> 01:08:49.237
Why you all let them in anyway,
man?


1246
01:08:49.238 --> 01:08:50.706
Hold on, hold on!

1247
01:08:50.707 --> 01:08:53.875
Let me talk to my man
for one second.


1248
01:08:53.876 --> 01:08:56.411
You got mo seconds.
Go ahead, take your time.


1249
01:08:56.412 --> 01:08:57.779
Okay, looky here.

1250
01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:00.348
Nigger act like he ain't never
performed for free before.


1251
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:01.685
Ain't that a bitch!

1252
01:09:08.891 --> 01:09:10.892
- Say what?
- The watch.


1253
01:09:10.893 --> 01:09:12.227
- With the big face?
- Yeah!


1254
01:09:12.228 --> 01:09:14.295
- Nigger, please!
- We got to pay him!


1255
01:09:14.296 --> 01:09:16.998
I have my half of the money.
Where your half?


1256
01:09:16.999 --> 01:09:19.200
It's in that motherfucking watch,
and we got to pay him.


1257
01:09:19.201 --> 01:09:21.903
I knew you was gonna do that.
I knew you was gonna do this.


1258
01:09:21.904 --> 01:09:24.773
You know how many numbers
I done got with this motherfucker?


1259
01:09:24.774 --> 01:09:27.108
- I love you, baby.
- Give it up.


1260
01:09:27.109 --> 01:09:29.077
Hey, come on. You done good.

1261
01:09:29.078 --> 01:09:32.047
Hey, G, I think we got
your problem solved.


1262
01:09:32.048 --> 01:09:34.485
We can pay you with that.

1263
01:09:35.852 --> 01:09:37.586
What the fuck is that?

1264
01:09:37.587 --> 01:09:39.287
What kind of watch is that?

1265
01:09:39.288 --> 01:09:41.590
That's something special.
That's a Genev...


1266
01:09:41.591 --> 01:09:44.158
Let me see.
Yeah. That's a Genitalia!


1267
01:09:44.159 --> 01:09:45.393
Genitalia.

1268
01:09:45.394 --> 01:09:47.763
A lot of rich white men,
they know about that.


1269
01:09:47.764 --> 01:09:49.598
You probably don't know
about that.


1270
01:09:49.599 --> 01:09:51.232
How much did you pay
for the watch, man?


1271
01:09:51.233 --> 01:09:52.967
- I paid 13,OOO.
- Thirteen Gs.


1272
01:09:52.968 --> 01:09:55.537
- You paid 13 what?
- Thirteen cold cash, baby.


1273
01:09:55.538 --> 01:09:57.773
Did that nigger have a gun
when he sold you this shit?


1274
01:09:57.774 --> 01:09:59.608
Man, you got robbed.

1275
01:09:59.609 --> 01:10:01.979
You not about to rob me with that.
Where my paper at?


1276
01:10:03.245 --> 01:10:05.714
I forgot...

1277
01:10:05.715 --> 01:10:07.718
Hey, hold on!

1278
01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:15.726
I wrote these myself!

1279
01:10:17.894 --> 01:10:19.730
- Man, they throwing stuff.
- Get back there.


1280
01:10:21.363 --> 01:10:22.764
Get your ass back there.

1281
01:10:22.765 --> 01:10:24.233
Now I'm back.

1282
01:10:27.303 --> 01:10:29.571
We some small-time brothers

1283
01:10:29.572 --> 01:10:32.073
trying to do something for the
little kids in the community.


1284
01:10:32.074 --> 01:10:34.109
You don't know no damn kids.
Hold up.


1285
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:36.077
Hey, pack up the equipment.
We about to roll.


1286
01:10:36.078 --> 01:10:37.312
No, no, no.

1287
01:10:37.313 --> 01:10:40.148
C.W., K.K., man, get these
fake-ass promoters out of here.


1288
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:41.716
Jeezy, Jeezy, baby!

1289
01:10:41.717 --> 01:10:44.052
Hold on, man!
Don't put your hands on me.


1290
01:10:44.053 --> 01:10:46.323
- Don't put your hands...
- Get the fuck out.


1291
01:10:47.757 --> 01:10:50.926
Keep yourself...!
You're a dead goddamn band.


1292
01:10:50.927 --> 01:10:52.761
Some bullshit right there, man!

1293
01:10:52.762 --> 01:10:54.228
What's going on?

1294
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:56.297
It's all good, man.

1295
01:10:56.298 --> 01:10:59.400
This motherfucking goddamn rapper,
he might not be performing.


1296
01:10:59.401 --> 01:11:01.002
Why the hell not?

1297
01:11:01.003 --> 01:11:03.404
If it ain't one thing, it's another.
Some bullshit, man.


1298
01:11:03.405 --> 01:11:04.640
Custody case, some shit.

1299
01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:07.576
What are we gonna do?
They're gonna tear down my theater!


1300
01:11:07.577 --> 01:11:10.178
That's the reason
why we got insurance!


1301
01:11:10.179 --> 01:11:12.380
Insurance? You know
what the deductible is?


1302
01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:14.115
Keep your voice down.

1303
01:11:14.116 --> 01:11:16.952
Jeezy, Jeezy, Jeezy.

1304
01:11:16.953 --> 01:11:18.519
Hey, come on. Yo.

1305
01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:21.692
Settle down.
Settle down, people.


1306
01:11:28.164 --> 01:11:30.165
- Hey, boy!
- Man, fuck you.


1307
01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:32.103
Get your boys.
Get your ass up there!


1308
01:11:34.937 --> 01:11:36.972
Let's go to this after party,
homeys.


1309
01:11:36.973 --> 01:11:38.475
What the fuck?

1310
01:11:40.142 --> 01:11:43.378
Get your fucking paws off me!

1311
01:11:43.379 --> 01:11:45.780
Let's fuck this shit up!
That's for Modesto!


1312
01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:49.951
Ain't no Jeezy? D-boys, fuck
this motherfucker up.


1313
01:11:49.952 --> 01:11:52.289
Get these motherfuckers!

1314
01:11:57.627 --> 01:11:59.596
Move! Do it, big boy.

1315
01:12:10.873 --> 01:12:12.741
Move this shit. Let's go!

1316
01:12:12.742 --> 01:12:15.814
What you doing, man?

1317
01:12:23.519 --> 01:12:26.157
Hey, man, what the hell's going on?

1318
01:12:26.889 --> 01:12:30.462
There go Mondo.
There's Mondo! Go!


1319
01:12:32.929 --> 01:12:34.531
Hey! No!

1320
01:12:46.075 --> 01:12:49.180
There they go! Jellyroll!

1321
01:12:50.379 --> 01:12:52.547
No! Goddamn it, move!

1322
01:12:52.548 --> 01:12:55.751
Move! Move, goddamn it!
Come on!


1323
01:12:55.752 --> 01:12:57.218
Let's kill 'em!

1324
01:12:57.219 --> 01:12:59.087
I want my money!

1325
01:12:59.088 --> 01:13:00.655
Move, motherfucker!
Move, bitch!


1326
01:13:00.656 --> 01:13:03.161
Come on, man! Shit!

1327
01:13:04.894 --> 01:13:06.127
Get in, man!

1328
01:13:06.128 --> 01:13:07.530
Come on, move! Move!

1329
01:13:08.597 --> 01:13:10.300
There they go!

1330
01:13:15.437 --> 01:13:16.572
Goddamn!

1331
01:13:21.944 --> 01:13:23.479
Fuck!

1332
01:13:26.816 --> 01:13:28.919
Y'all didn't see shit.

1333
01:13:30.286 --> 01:13:32.056
Back 'em up.

1334
01:13:53.109 --> 01:13:54.611
Shit.

1335
01:13:59.615 --> 01:14:03.018
God! Look at my car.

1336
01:14:03.019 --> 01:14:04.853
- Yeah.
- Damn.


1337
01:14:04.854 --> 01:14:07.622
Man, we did it tonight.

1338
01:14:07.623 --> 01:14:08.857
I know it, man.

1339
01:14:08.858 --> 01:14:11.860
I want to take full responsibility
for tonight, man.


1340
01:14:11.861 --> 01:14:14.963
I fucked up. I should've paid
Jeezy his money, man.


1341
01:14:14.964 --> 01:14:16.297
That's all there is to it.

1342
01:14:16.298 --> 01:14:18.900
No, no, I'm glad you didn't
pay them niggers shit,


1343
01:14:18.901 --> 01:14:21.402
'cause if you'd have paid them
and they went on,


1344
01:14:21.403 --> 01:14:23.071
we'd have still took a loss, man.

1345
01:14:23.072 --> 01:14:24.973
Shit, might as well
both take a loss.


1346
01:14:24.974 --> 01:14:28.343
I'm just mad I spent my Aruba money
on some damn rap concert.


1347
01:14:28.344 --> 01:14:31.616
Yeah, you did.
You fucked up on that for real.


1348
01:14:32.447 --> 01:14:35.116
Yeah. I ain't the only one
fucked up.


1349
01:14:35.117 --> 01:14:37.685
You fucked up bringing
Mondo into the picture.


1350
01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:40.254
Motherfucker almost
decapitated me!


1351
01:14:40.255 --> 01:14:43.058
You know me.
I mess up all the time.


1352
01:14:43.059 --> 01:14:46.027
You need to worry about
Loli killing your ass


1353
01:14:46.028 --> 01:14:48.065
about that wedding money.

1354
01:14:49.598 --> 01:14:51.599
I got a perfect solution.

1355
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.168
I'm out of the game, Jellyroll.

1356
01:14:53.169 --> 01:14:55.269
Don't try to talk me out of it.

1357
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:58.606
We're not doing this no more.
This shit don't work for us.


1358
01:14:58.607 --> 01:15:01.775
No, no! How you
gonna stop promoting?


1359
01:15:01.776 --> 01:15:05.680
We Modesto's finest,
and you talking 'bout quitting?


1360
01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:08.950
Don't nobody come to town
unless we bring them into town.


1361
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:10.551
- You feel me?
- I feel you.


1362
01:15:10.552 --> 01:15:12.753
You're the best, man.
It's in your blood.


1363
01:15:12.754 --> 01:15:14.655
- It is, man.
- Come on, come on, baby.


1364
01:15:14.656 --> 01:15:18.193
It is in my blood,
'cause we be promoters, man.


1365
01:15:18.194 --> 01:15:20.494
I'm back! Fuck it, I'm back.

1366
01:15:20.495 --> 01:15:22.563
Ticket sales is
overrated any damn way.


1367
01:15:22.564 --> 01:15:24.933
Fuck the ticket sales.
We who we are, baby.


1368
01:15:24.934 --> 01:15:28.369
We get money, man.
We don't care none about that.


1369
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:29.770
Hello?

1370
01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:32.473
<i>Where you at?
I know the snow's over,</i>


1371
01:15:32.474 --> 01:15:35.210
Sure, I'm just shooting
the shit here with Jellyroll.


1372
01:15:35.211 --> 01:15:36.444
How you doin', baby?

1373
01:15:36.445 --> 01:15:39.948
<i>I'm at the after party.
Your coming? It's packed!</i>


1374
01:15:39.949 --> 01:15:41.182
It's packed?

1375
01:15:41.183 --> 01:15:44.452
<i>Yeah. Jeezy picked up
one of Mondo's flyers, and he's here.</i>


1376
01:15:44.453 --> 01:15:46.988
<i>He allmost knocked me down
trying to get in.</i>


1377
01:15:46.989 --> 01:15:48.589
<i>- Jeezy's there?
- Yeah!</i>


1378
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:49.958
<i>How long is it gonna take you?</i>

1379
01:15:49.959 --> 01:15:51.893
'Bout 20 minutes.
I'll be right there.


1380
01:15:51.894 --> 01:15:53.128
What's happening?

1381
01:15:53.129 --> 01:15:55.230
Hey, the after party packed,
Jeezy there.


1382
01:15:55.231 --> 01:15:58.170
We back in business, baby.
We back in it!


1383
01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:12.981
Yeah!

1384
01:16:12.982 --> 01:16:14.415
Yo, what up, 'Do!

1385
01:16:14.416 --> 01:16:17.285
It's your boy, DJ Scream.

1386
01:16:17.286 --> 01:16:20.821
Big shouts out to Mondo
and the D-boys.


1387
01:16:20.822 --> 01:16:24.125
Right about now,
coming to the stage,


1388
01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:27.162
he came here tonight for the
after party to represent for y'all,


1389
01:16:27.163 --> 01:16:33.108

a warm yeah...


1390
01:16:34.103 --> 01:16:40.314

Young Jeezy!


1391
01:16:41.843 --> 01:16:45.213
Yeah. What up, what up, what up!

1392
01:16:45.214 --> 01:16:47.782
What up, Modesto?

1393
01:16:47.783 --> 01:16:49.850
I didn't get a chance
to perform tonight


1394
01:16:49.851 --> 01:16:51.352
'cause of some janky-ass promoter,

1395
01:16:51.353 --> 01:16:53.922
but I mean, your city
has shown me so much love, man,


1396
01:16:53.923 --> 01:16:55.623
so I'm gonna show y'all
some love too.


1397
01:16:55.624 --> 01:16:57.792
- You got something for me?
- I got you, big dog.


1398
01:16:57.793 --> 01:17:00.195
Let's get 'em, Mo. Hands up!

1399
01:17:00.196 --> 01:17:02.830
You like how I invested
in this after party?


1400
01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:05.133
Yeah, I do.
You know what? Come here.


1401
01:17:05.134 --> 01:17:08.703
I like how you invested in that watch,
so I might have to invest in that.


1402
01:17:08.704 --> 01:17:11.105
Pay for my wedding,
you understand that?


1403
01:17:11.106 --> 01:17:13.109
Come on, Loli.
Let's go, baby.


1404
01:17:19.848 --> 01:17:21.316
Jellyroll!

1405
01:17:21.317 --> 01:17:23.584
Just the man I wanted to see.

1406
01:17:23.585 --> 01:17:25.020
What's happening, Mondo, baby?

1407
01:17:25.021 --> 01:17:27.588
Thanks for getting Jeezy
to show up to my after party.


1408
01:17:27.589 --> 01:17:29.190
Told you I knew the nigger, man.

1409
01:17:29.191 --> 01:17:31.425
Looks like we are
better promoters, though.


1410
01:17:31.426 --> 01:17:33.861
Wait, you saying that to say what?

1411
01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:37.598
Your shit was empty,
and our shit is packed!


1412
01:17:37.599 --> 01:17:38.833
Beginners' luck, baby.

1413
01:17:38.834 --> 01:17:42.541
You gonna need a few more years in Devry
to be a better promoter than me.


1414
01:19:20.769 --> 01:19:22.104
Let's go!
