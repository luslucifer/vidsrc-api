sweet little thing.


165

- Thank you.
- And I want you


166
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.343
to take care of my baby.

167
00:08:00.387 --> 00:08:02.476
- Consider it done.

168
00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:06.523
- And this is my troublesome
little sister Tweety.


169
00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:09.831

misleading her roommate.

And you call me before

I am so sorry about that.


197
00:09:04.755 --> 00:09:07.976
Sometimes my folks can
be so embarrassing.

Where are you from?

206
00:09:16.637 --> 00:09:17.855
- Modesto California.

207
00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:20.858
- What, that is
like so far away.


208
00:09:20.902 --> 00:09:22.860
How did you even find
out about Texas Central.


209
00:09:22.904 --> 00:09:24.166
- Well I was a
four-year letterman


210
00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:25.820
in high school soccer
and they recruited me,


211
00:09:25.863 --> 00:09:28.605
plus I always wanted
to go to HBCU.

You play any sports?

213

to when my term paper's due.

217
00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:42.053
- How you gonna hustle
your new roommate?

you down to go?

222
00:09:48.016 --> 00:09:50.714
- I still have a lot
of bags to unpack


223
00:09:50.758 --> 00:09:53.891
so I might wanna take
it a little slow.

the bags can wait.

00:20:26.697 --> 00:20:28.525
- My mom always did
say, "I could talk a lot


484
00:20:28.569 --> 00:20:29.657
"when I wanted to."

485
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.789
- Ha, yeah I believe her.

486
00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:32.616
- Hey.

487
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.357
[laughing]

488
00:20:34.401 --> 00:20:37.795
- So did you date a lot
when you was in high school?


489
00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:41.060
- So that's where this
conversation is going.


490
00:20:41.103 --> 00:20:43.366
- Inquiring minds wanna know.

491
00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:48.328
- I dated a couple of
guys in high school.


492
00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:50.504
- Anyone serious?

493
00:20:50.547 --> 00:20:51.505
- Not really.

494
00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:57.032
There was one guy that
I was serious with.


495
00:20:57.076 --> 00:20:59.730
I was serious with
him junior year


496
00:20:59.774 --> 00:21:01.863
but we broke up right
before prom night.


497
00:21:01.906 --> 00:21:04.431
- Wait, what happened?

498
00:21:04.474 --> 00:21:06.389
- Basically in a
nutshell I wasn't ready


499
00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:10.480
to do the things that
teens do on prom night.


500
00:21:10.524 --> 00:21:11.264
- Wow.

501
00:21:12.265 --> 00:21:15.703
So he left you because of that.

502
00:21:15.746 --> 00:21:16.443
- Yep.

503
00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:22.710
- Well, that's his loss because
I'd never do that to you.


504
00:21:24.364 --> 00:21:25.582
- We shall see.

505
00:21:27.193 --> 00:21:30.544
- Well, enough of
the 21 questions.


506
00:21:30.587 --> 00:21:32.894
Let's get outta here.

507
00:21:32.937 --> 00:21:33.851
- All right.

508
00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.563
[group chattering]

509
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.434
- I noticed.

510
00:21:52.522 --> 00:21:53.393
Hey Stacey.

511
00:21:56.004 --> 00:21:56.787
Wake up.

512
00:21:58.006 --> 00:21:59.268
Stacey, wake up.

513
00:22:00.965 --> 00:22:01.966
Hey wake up.

514
00:22:06.188 --> 00:22:08.669
- Oh, hey Jas, what's up girl?

515
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.412
- Just getting in
from soccer practice.


516
00:22:12.455 --> 00:22:15.806
I know you not slacking
already in these classes.


517
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.287
- [Stacey] Oh, girl I'm up.

518
00:22:18.331 --> 00:22:20.071
Okay, I was just
resting my eyes.


519
00:22:20.115 --> 00:22:21.421
- Yeah, sure.

520
00:22:21.464 --> 00:22:22.987
- Hey this is my
teammate Tiffany.


521
00:22:23.031 --> 00:22:24.467
- Hey, nice to meet you.

522
00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:27.340
- Hi, nice to meet
you as well, Tiffany.


523
00:22:27.383 --> 00:22:31.257
- Stacey, you look wore
out, you need that rest.


524
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.215
- Girl, I'm fine.

525
00:22:33.259 --> 00:22:35.565
I was just on the phone
all night with Benjamin.


526
00:22:35.609 --> 00:22:36.958
You know how that goes.

527
00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:38.525
- And I also know your daddy's

528
00:22:38.568 --> 00:22:41.441
gonna lay the smack down on
you for that cell phone bill.


529
00:22:41.484 --> 00:22:44.792
- Ah, Stacey y'all must be
in the honeymoon phase, huh?


530
00:22:44.835 --> 00:22:46.446
- Yeah, that's
what they call it.


531
00:22:46.489 --> 00:22:48.187
[laughing]

532
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.363
- Well, you know if you
need help staying up


533
00:22:50.406 --> 00:22:51.842
I know a guy with some pills.

534
00:22:51.886 --> 00:22:54.323
I mean it's better than No
-Doz.

535
00:22:56.195 --> 00:22:57.805
- Thank you but
I think I'm gonna


536
00:22:57.848 --> 00:22:59.459
take a raincheck on that one.

537
00:22:59.502 --> 00:23:00.373
- All right.

538
00:23:01.852 --> 00:23:03.898
- Hello.
- Yeah.


539
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:07.945
- Oh, I've been thinking
about you all day too.


540
00:23:07.989 --> 00:23:10.209
- She's already hooked.

541
00:23:10.252 --> 00:23:11.471
[laughing]

542
00:23:11.514 --> 00:23:14.213
But anyways did you
talk about coach?


543
00:23:31.491 --> 00:23:32.492
- Hey.

544
00:23:32.535 --> 00:23:33.319
- Hi.

545
00:23:33.362 --> 00:23:34.145
- Come on in.

546
00:23:34.189 --> 00:23:35.234
- Thank you.

547
00:23:35.277 --> 00:23:37.627
- Wow, you look great.

548
00:23:37.671 --> 00:23:38.585
- Thanks.

549
00:23:38.628 --> 00:23:40.717
Jasmine helped me pick this out.

550
00:23:40.761 --> 00:23:42.850
- I see she have
an eye for fashion.


551
00:23:42.893 --> 00:23:44.895
- Yes, she does.

552
00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:47.158
- Oh, I hope you don't
mind taking off your shoes.


553
00:23:47.202 --> 00:23:49.770
I'm trying to keep
this place clean here.


554
00:23:49.813 --> 00:23:51.859
- Yeah, it's okay, I don't mind.

555
00:23:51.902 --> 00:23:53.077
Where should I put them.

556
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:54.165
- [Benjamin] Right there
by the door is fine.


557
00:23:54.209 --> 00:23:55.428
- [Stacey] Okay.

558
00:23:59.562 --> 00:24:00.998
- Right this way.

559
00:24:01.042 --> 00:24:01.912
- Thank you.

560
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.221
So have you made any films?

561
00:24:06.265 --> 00:24:09.529
- Yeah, yeah, I made a couple
short films here on campus.


562
00:24:09.572 --> 00:24:11.966
You know creating art is fun.

563
00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:14.098
- Well thank you for doing that

564
00:24:14.142 --> 00:24:16.492
because we need more
people that look like us


565
00:24:16.536 --> 00:24:18.755
creating content for us.

566
00:24:18.799 --> 00:24:20.583
- Indeed, thank you.

567
00:24:20.627 --> 00:24:21.628
- [Stacey] You're welcome.

568
00:24:21.671 --> 00:24:23.717
- Power to the people.

569
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.675
- Right back at ya.

570
00:24:25.719 --> 00:24:28.678
[laughing]

571
00:24:28.722 --> 00:24:31.464
- So are you close
to your family?


572
00:24:31.507 --> 00:24:33.640
- Yeah, we are real close.

573
00:24:33.683 --> 00:24:36.512
We pretty much do
everything together.


574
00:24:36.556 --> 00:24:38.427
Come and think of it
this is the longest time


575
00:24:38.471 --> 00:24:40.124
that we have ever been
away from each other.


576
00:24:40.168 --> 00:24:40.951
- Really.

577
00:24:40.995 --> 00:24:42.518
- Yeah.

578
00:24:42.562 --> 00:24:45.826
So what about you, are you
close with your family?


579
00:24:45.869 --> 00:24:47.958
- Nah, not so much.

580
00:24:48.002 --> 00:24:49.395
You know my dad
he ran out on us

581
00:24:49.438 --> 00:24:50.831
when I was about two-years-old.

582
00:24:50.874 --> 00:24:52.441
- [Stacey] What?

583
00:24:52.485 --> 00:24:54.095
- Yeah, so I reached out to
him about a couple years ago


584
00:24:54.138 --> 00:24:56.184
but he kept his distance.

585
00:24:56.227 --> 00:24:59.492
Let my mom tell he's
a no good player.


586
00:24:59.535 --> 00:25:01.102
- What, damn.

587
00:25:01.145 --> 00:25:03.800
I'm sorry to hear that you
had to go through that Ben.


588
00:25:03.844 --> 00:25:06.934
Well, how are things
between you and mom?


589
00:25:06.977 --> 00:25:10.894
- My mom, my mom still
tryin' to get over my dad.


590
00:25:10.938 --> 00:25:12.853
You know she raised me to
the best of her ability


591
00:25:12.896 --> 00:25:15.290
but I look so much like my dad

592
00:25:17.161 --> 00:25:19.425
she take all her
frustration out on me.


593
00:25:19.468 --> 00:25:21.340
So you know when I
finally see something


594
00:25:21.383 --> 00:25:24.560
that's worth having
I try my best to keep


595
00:25:24.604 --> 00:25:26.736
and sometimes to a default.

596
00:25:30.087 --> 00:25:34.875
- Well, you don't have to worry
about any of that with me.


597
00:25:43.666 --> 00:25:45.799
- If you don't like
the grades you receive


598
00:25:45.842 --> 00:25:49.411
then that means you
need to step it up.


599
00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:52.936
You can make the grades
up during midterms.


600
00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:56.244
Class dismissed.

601
00:25:56.287 --> 00:25:58.507
Except for you Stacey.

602
00:25:58.551 --> 00:26:00.379
I said class dismissed.

603
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:12.086
How do you make
a C- in my class

604
00:26:12.129 --> 00:26:15.306
when I know you can do better?

605
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.005
- I'm sorry Professor James--

606
00:26:18.048 --> 00:26:19.702
- Sorry is a game made
by Parker Brothers,


607
00:26:19.746 --> 00:26:21.791
it's a game board do
you like being played?


608
00:26:21.835 --> 00:26:22.575
- No sir.

609
00:26:23.837 --> 00:26:25.491
- Then why this, huh?

610
00:26:26.405 --> 00:26:28.972
What's going on with you?

611
00:26:29.016 --> 00:26:32.019
- I just gotta get my focus,
I been so tired lately.


612
00:26:32.062 --> 00:26:34.413
- I'm sure that your parents
don't wanna hear any excuses,


613
00:26:34.456 --> 00:26:37.677
they didn't send you
here to make any either.


614
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.289
You tired, what's the difference
between the Stacey now


615
00:26:41.332 --> 00:26:44.640
and the Stacey that was here
at the start of the semester?


616
00:26:44.684 --> 00:26:48.296
- I can handle it
Professor James.


617
00:26:48.339 --> 00:26:49.906
I just didn't think.

618
00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:53.693
I--
- You didn't think.


619
00:26:53.736 --> 00:26:55.085
You didn't think.

620
00:26:55.129 --> 00:26:57.131
You didn't even think!

621
00:26:57.174 --> 00:27:00.917
Do you know what it took for
you to get into this classroom?


622
00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:03.093
Stacey, do you know what your
people had to go through,


623
00:27:03.137 --> 00:27:04.312
what our people
had to go through?


624
00:27:04.355 --> 00:27:05.835
Do you know what our ancestors

625
00:27:05.879 --> 00:27:08.272
had to deal with
just to get us here?


626
00:27:08.316 --> 00:27:10.144
Do you know the bodies
that were severed?


627
00:27:10.187 --> 00:27:12.059
The backs that were beaten?

628
00:27:12.102 --> 00:27:13.626
Do you know the ones
that didn't make it


629
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:17.456
just so you could get
here in my classroom?


630
00:27:17.499 --> 00:27:20.589
Stacey, let me give you
a little bit of history


631
00:27:20.633 --> 00:27:23.592
when God made man
and called him Adam


632
00:27:25.899 --> 00:27:29.555
but he put Adam asleep
and make him a helpmate


633
00:27:29.598 --> 00:27:31.121
because Adam didn't even
know he needed help!


634
00:27:31.165 --> 00:27:33.341
You understand me?

635
00:27:33.384 --> 00:27:34.603
Eve was her name

636
00:27:36.866 --> 00:27:41.697
but I'm gonna treat you like
Adam should've treated Eve


637
00:27:41.741 --> 00:27:43.917
when she got
tricked by the Devil


638
00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.049
because somebody's tricking you.

639
00:27:46.093 --> 00:27:47.616
Do I make myself clear?

640
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.922
- [Stacey] Yes sir,
Professor James.


641
00:27:48.965 --> 00:27:50.053
- Get out of my presence.

642
00:27:50.097 --> 00:27:51.490
- [Stacey] Yes sir.

643
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:55.929
- And Stacey.

644
00:27:56.973 --> 00:27:57.844
- [Stacey] Yes sir.

645
00:27:57.887 --> 00:27:59.585
- Have a good evening.

646
00:28:15.557 --> 00:28:17.733
- Hey what was that all about

647
00:28:17.777 --> 00:28:19.822
between you and Professor James?

648
00:28:19.866 --> 00:28:21.607
- Oh, my grades are slipping

649
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.478
so he just wanted to
give me a pep talk.


650
00:28:23.522 --> 00:28:24.697
- [Benjamin] That's all.

651
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.089
- What do you mean?

652
00:28:26.133 --> 00:28:28.222
- He wasn't brushin'
up on you, was he?


653
00:28:28.265 --> 00:28:29.092
I mean you'd tell me.

654
00:28:29.136 --> 00:28:31.181
- No, of course not.

655
00:28:31.225 --> 00:28:35.534
He was just concerned
about my grades that's it.


656
00:28:35.577 --> 00:28:36.317
- Okay.

657
00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.755
- But I'm gonna
have to double down


658
00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:41.452
on my studies for midterms

659
00:28:41.496 --> 00:28:43.933
so I won't be able
to see you as much.


660
00:28:43.977 --> 00:28:45.674
But I promise to call.

661
00:28:48.198 --> 00:28:49.852
- I understand.

662
00:28:49.896 --> 00:28:52.376
Let's just make it
count next time, deal.


663
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.160
- Deal.

664

[upbeat music]

665
00:30:35.479 --> 00:30:39.048
- Hey you tryin' to
warn me about something.


666
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:43.096
You got me watching
this crazy movie.


667
00:30:43.139 --> 00:30:44.401
[laughing]

668
00:30:44.445 --> 00:30:46.926
- No, I just like
thriller films.


669
00:30:48.014 --> 00:30:50.712
- What's this called anyways?

670
00:30:50.756 --> 00:30:52.366
- "The Perfect Wife".

671
00:30:55.108 --> 00:30:57.893
- "The Perfect
Wife" what a cliche.


672
00:30:57.937 --> 00:31:00.156
- Shh, this is the good part.

673
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.681
[phone ringing]

674
00:31:03.551 --> 00:31:05.379
- Let it ring.

675
00:31:05.422 --> 00:31:07.207
You always jumping as
soon as your phone rings,


676
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.556
there somebody more
important than me?


677
00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:09.905
- No, there's not.

678
00:31:09.949 --> 00:31:11.472
But you know it
might be Jasmine.


679
00:31:11.515 --> 00:31:12.516
- So.

680
00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.084
- So me, Jasmine, and Tiffany

681
00:31:15.128 --> 00:31:16.564
are supposed to be
hanging out today.


682
00:31:16.607 --> 00:31:18.958
I mean you know they're my
girls, I'll always be with them.


683
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:20.742
- And what about me?

684
00:31:20.786 --> 00:31:22.352
- What about you?

685
00:31:22.396 --> 00:31:24.267
I spend all of my time with you.

686
00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:25.791
I barely even get to see them.

687
00:31:25.834 --> 00:31:28.315
Lately it's just been
you and these classes.


688
00:31:28.358 --> 00:31:31.187
- Okay, well what's
wrong with that?


689
00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:32.362
- What do you mean?

690
00:31:32.406 --> 00:31:33.537
Boy, don't make me hurt you.

691
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:35.496
Over there being greedy.

692
00:31:37.063 --> 00:31:40.109
- Look you don't need to
hang out with your friends.


693
00:31:40.153 --> 00:31:41.110
- Wait, what?

694
00:31:43.634 --> 00:31:46.028
Are you joking right now?

695
00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:49.423
- Look at me, I'm all
the friends you need.


696
00:31:49.466 --> 00:31:53.601
- Okay, so what about you,
don't you have friends?


697
00:31:53.644 --> 00:31:57.213
- I'm like that rapper
Z-Ro, I only hang one.


698
00:31:59.607 --> 00:32:03.263
- Oh my goodness what
am I gonna do with you?


699
00:32:08.137 --> 00:32:09.748
- You almost there.

700
00:32:17.581 --> 00:32:19.366
- Dang Stacey you look good.

701
00:32:19.409 --> 00:32:20.628
Girl, where you going?

702
00:32:20.671 --> 00:32:22.151
- Well thank you girl.

703
00:32:22.195 --> 00:32:23.805
Benjamin is taking
me out tonight


704
00:32:23.849 --> 00:32:26.286
but he didn't say
where he just said,


705
00:32:26.329 --> 00:32:28.288
"That it's a surprise."

706
00:32:28.331 --> 00:32:31.378
- Now Jasmine is gonna
expect the same thing.


707
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:32.901
Thanks a lot Stacey.

708
00:32:32.945 --> 00:32:34.555
- Oh, no, no, no, do
not put me in the middle

00:32:34.598 --> 00:32:36.296
of y'all two situation.

710
00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:37.776
But step it up bro.

711
00:32:39.603 --> 00:32:41.605
- Don't look at me you
seeing a grad student,


712
00:32:41.649 --> 00:32:42.955
I'm just a freshman.

Holla me in five years.

714
00:32:46.132 --> 00:32:47.786
- So is Benjamin coming over?

715
00:32:47.829 --> 00:32:49.004
- Yeah.

716
00:32:49.048 --> 00:32:50.136
- Oh, great.

717
00:32:50.179 --> 00:32:51.746
So we finally get to meet him.

718
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.357
- Yeah, you've been
hiding him all semester.


719
00:32:54.401 --> 00:32:56.664
- He's just a loner, okay.

720
00:32:56.707 --> 00:32:59.275
He just likes to be by himself.

packed house tonight.

00:33:18.904 --> 00:33:21.863
- Stop being so nervous
these are just my friends.

And this is my roommate
Jasmine and her friend Anthony.

it's nice to meet you.

We've heard a lot about you.

- Well I hope it was good.

737

- For the most part.

- You ready to go babe.

00:33:40.664 --> 00:33:41.404
- Yeah.

00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:45.582
I thought you was gonna
wear your hair down?


741
00:33:45.626 --> 00:33:47.628
You know I like it like that.

742
00:33:47.671 --> 00:33:50.152
- Oh, yeah I know but I
just wanted to go ahead


743
00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:52.198
and put it up so it
won't be in face.

- You know don't worry about it.

What was I thinking?

746
00:33:55.157 --> 00:33:56.724
Maybe I was asking to much.

747
00:33:56.767 --> 00:33:58.160
- No, no, no, it's okay.

Look I'll go change
it real quick.

going with you and Benjamin?

- You don't think things are
moving a little too fast?

- No, I think we're
at a good pace.

- Does he have a temper?

I've seen him snap on you a
little bit a few weeks back.

- I mean I can tell that
he likes things his way

00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:44.076
but it's nothing I can't handle.

- I'm taking Ben to meet
my parents next weekend.

Wow, it's getting serious.

Do you think your
family will like him?

- Yeah, I think so.

I mean it's not like
I bring boys home

all the time to meet them.

00:43:34.301 --> 00:43:36.956
You have to believe me.

965
00:43:36.999 --> 00:43:38.174
- Why should I?

966
00:43:41.917 --> 00:43:44.877
- Look I want you
to meet my mother.


967
00:43:47.619 --> 00:43:49.447
I mean she's the only person

968
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:52.798
that means a lot
to me in my family.


969
00:43:52.841 --> 00:43:57.367
I mean I must warn you she
can get a bit harsh at times.


970
00:44:05.201 --> 00:44:06.376
- Your mother.

971
00:44:09.902 --> 00:44:12.687
I don't, I don't
know what to say.


972
00:44:13.775 --> 00:44:15.255
- Say yes, please.

973
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:22.958
- Yes.

974
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.575
- You wanna go to
the student center.


975
00:44:30.618 --> 00:44:33.273
- Yeah, let me
just get my purse.


976
00:44:34.535 --> 00:44:35.362
Okay.

977
00:44:44.893 --> 00:44:47.592
[dramatic music]

978
00:44:53.859 --> 00:44:55.687
You have a lovely home.

979
00:44:57.602 --> 00:44:59.081
- Do I?

980
00:44:59.125 --> 00:45:00.256
- Yes, you do.

981
00:45:02.128 --> 00:45:03.782
- Thanks for noticing.

982
00:45:03.825 --> 00:45:05.392
- [Stacey] Your welcome.

983
00:45:05.435 --> 00:45:06.915
- Benjamin where'd you find her?

984
00:45:06.959 --> 00:45:08.613
She's cute.

985
00:45:08.656 --> 00:45:12.921
- I told you momma, we
go to school together.


986
00:45:12.965 --> 00:45:16.229
- Boy don't get smart with me!

987
00:45:16.272 --> 00:45:19.014
Now you watch your
tone in my house.


988
00:45:19.058 --> 00:45:20.625
- Benjamin is the
professor's aid


989
00:45:20.668 --> 00:45:23.932
in my class, English
literature advanced.


990
00:45:25.194 --> 00:45:26.108
- Advanced.

991
00:45:28.284 --> 00:45:30.896
So you one of those smart girls.

992
00:45:32.375 --> 00:45:34.639
What you doing with my son?

993
00:45:34.682 --> 00:45:36.815
[laughing]

994
00:45:39.078 --> 00:45:40.470
I'm just kidding.

995
00:45:46.868 --> 00:45:50.916
Yeah, you always did like
I'm young and smart though


996
00:45:50.959 --> 00:45:52.526
just like his daddy.

997
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:55.094
- Momma.

998
00:45:55.137 --> 00:45:56.182
- What?

999
00:45:56.225 --> 00:45:57.487
- That's enough.

1000
00:45:58.663 --> 00:46:01.230
- Benjamin is also
smart and kind.


1001
00:46:04.103 --> 00:46:07.106
He took me out for our
first date to the bookstore.


1002
00:46:07.149 --> 00:46:09.021
Now how many girls can say that?

1003
00:46:09.064 --> 00:46:10.631
- Not many.

1004
00:46:10.675 --> 00:46:12.764
It sounds like a cheap date.

1005
00:46:12.807 --> 00:46:16.855
- Well no, we also go to
parties and step shows together.


1006
00:46:16.898 --> 00:46:18.160
As a matter of fact

1007
00:46:18.204 --> 00:46:20.293
we're going to another
step show this Friday.


1008
00:46:20.336 --> 00:46:24.776
- Well, hopefully he'll keep
up the good work with you.


1009
00:46:26.081 --> 00:46:28.301
I'm sure you'll
keep him in line.


1010
00:46:28.344 --> 00:46:30.172
- Will do Ms. Williams.

1011
00:46:31.696 --> 00:46:33.959
What kinda spices did
you put in this gumbo,


1012
00:46:34.002 --> 00:46:35.482
this taste so good?

1013
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.966
- That's just a
old family recipe.


1014
00:46:47.537 --> 00:46:50.410
Boy get that food off your face!

1015
00:46:50.453 --> 00:46:53.326
You don't feel that right there!

1016
00:46:53.369 --> 00:46:56.285
And put the cloth around
your shirt like I showed you.


1017
00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:57.373
- Yes, Momma.

1018
00:47:01.813 --> 00:47:04.685
- Godliness is next
to cleanliness.


1019
00:47:07.296 --> 00:47:10.169
- Cleanliness next
to Godliness Momma.


1020
00:47:10.212 --> 00:47:13.128
- I told you don't
get smart with me.


1021
00:47:16.218 --> 00:47:17.655
Like I was saying,

1022
00:47:21.659 --> 00:47:25.532
hopefully he'll keep up
the good work with you.


1023
00:47:26.968 --> 00:47:31.016
Looking for somebody to
pass this recipe down to.


1024
00:47:32.365 --> 00:47:35.890
Seriously though how's
my son treating you?


1025
00:47:41.113 --> 00:47:44.159
- I mean we have
our ups and downs


1026
00:47:44.203 --> 00:47:46.031
just like everyone else.

1027
00:47:47.772 --> 00:47:50.035
- Are you sure he's
not kicking you down.


1028
00:47:50.078 --> 00:47:51.297
- You know what that's it.
- What?


1029
00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.559
- We gotta go.
- Benjamin, what is going on?


1030
00:47:52.602 --> 00:47:54.779
- You have a good night Momma.

1031
00:47:54.822 --> 00:47:56.389
- [Stacey] Benjamin.

1032
00:47:58.043 --> 00:48:01.960
- Well I guess y'all don't
want the peach cobbler than.


1033
00:48:02.003 --> 00:48:04.484
[upbeat music]

1034
00:48:21.457 --> 00:48:26.419
- So how was dinner last night
with Benjamin and his mom?


1035
00:48:27.202 --> 00:48:28.551
- Let's just say I see

1036
00:48:28.595 --> 00:48:32.381
where he gets some of
best personality from.


1037
00:48:32.425 --> 00:48:34.862
- She was crazier than Benjamin.

1038
00:48:34.906 --> 00:48:36.995
Glad I wasn't there.

1039
00:48:37.038 --> 00:48:39.562
- Girl she was just so negative.

1040
00:48:39.606 --> 00:48:44.219
I mean not towards me, mostly
towards Benjamin her only son.


1041
00:48:44.263 --> 00:48:46.787
- Look, hurt people hurt people.

1042
00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:50.399
- What do you mean?

1043
00:48:50.443 --> 00:48:51.879
- I never told you this

1044
00:48:51.923 --> 00:48:54.882
but I was a victim of domestic
violence in high school.


1045
00:48:54.926 --> 00:48:56.318
- What?

1046
00:48:56.362 --> 00:48:59.147
Jasmine I don't understand
you're so strong.


1047
00:48:59.191 --> 00:49:01.367
I can't imagine somebody
putting their hands on you.


1048
00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:06.285
- Honestly I didn't see it
either till it happened.


1049
00:49:07.808 --> 00:49:09.375
- I mean if you don't mind
telling me what happened?


1050
00:49:09.418 --> 00:49:12.682
- I had a boyfriend in high
school, we were so in love.


1051
00:49:12.726 --> 00:49:14.510
In my eyes he could no wrong.

1052
00:49:14.554 --> 00:49:16.425
My friends would tell me
he had a drinking problem


1053
00:49:16.469 --> 00:49:18.601
'cause his dad not
being there for him


1054
00:49:18.645 --> 00:49:21.300
and he could be
violent at times.


1055
00:49:23.215 --> 00:49:25.478
- Jeez I mean did you
even believe them?


1056
00:49:25.521 --> 00:49:27.828
- I mean maybe but I
didn't see any of that


1057
00:49:27.872 --> 00:49:29.743
when he was with me.

1058
00:49:29.787 --> 00:49:32.137
Till this one day
we were at a party


1059
00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.616
I was talking to
one of my homeboys,


1060
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.793
we were laughing and joking.

1061
00:49:35.836 --> 00:49:38.491
My boyfriend was
drinking of course


1062
00:49:38.534 --> 00:49:40.667
and he took the
situation the wrong way


1063
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:42.408
and he beat up my
friend really bad.


1064
00:49:42.451 --> 00:49:44.149
- What did you do?

1065
00:49:44.192 --> 00:49:45.411
- What could I do?

1066
00:49:45.454 --> 00:49:47.761
I yelled, I screamed, I
begged for him to stop


1067
00:49:47.805 --> 00:49:49.807
but he didn't.

1068
00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:53.506
Then he took me in the
backroom called me a whore.


1069
00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:54.942
I told him, "I
wanted to go home."


1070
00:49:54.986 --> 00:49:58.598
But I guess out of
frustration he slapped me.


1071
00:50:00.556 --> 00:50:05.518
Of course he said, "He was
sorry, he'd never do it again."


1072
00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:07.694
- Jasmine did you take him back?

1073
00:50:07.737 --> 00:50:08.826
- I loved him.

1074
00:50:10.175 --> 00:50:11.437
What could I do?

1075
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.613
I couldn't see myself
with anyone else but him


1076
00:50:13.656 --> 00:50:15.571
until it happened again.

1077
00:50:16.877 --> 00:50:18.748
After that I told my
dad and my brothers


1078
00:50:18.792 --> 00:50:21.664
and they went to
pay him a visit.


1079
00:50:21.708 --> 00:50:26.452
After that he literally
wouldn't look my way at school.


1080
00:50:26.495 --> 00:50:27.583
- Wow Jasmine.

1081
00:50:30.151 --> 00:50:31.587
- Look I'm not telling
you to get some goons


1082
00:50:31.631 --> 00:50:32.850
if these happens to you

1083
00:50:32.893 --> 00:50:35.548
but at least seek
help of some sort.


1084
00:50:38.812 --> 00:50:42.120
- Thank you for
sharing that with me.


1085
00:50:42.163 --> 00:50:42.990
- Of course.

1086
00:50:50.955 --> 00:50:51.738
- Babe.

1087
00:50:53.392 --> 00:50:56.090
You got a text
message from Tiffany.


1088
00:50:56.134 --> 00:50:57.178
- Oh, okay thank you.

1089
00:50:57.222 --> 00:50:58.005
Get my phone.

1090
00:50:58.049 --> 00:50:58.919
- I got it.

1091
00:50:58.963 --> 00:51:00.703
What's your code?

1092
00:51:00.747 --> 00:51:02.357
- Why do you wanna know my code

1093
00:51:02.401 --> 00:51:04.316
can I just please have my phone?

1094
00:51:04.359 --> 00:51:07.101
- What we hiding things
from each other now?


1095
00:51:07.145 --> 00:51:09.321
- I'm not hiding
anything from you.


1096
00:51:09.364 --> 00:51:11.801
- Okay, so why you got
a code on your phone?


1097
00:51:11.845 --> 00:51:13.716
I don't have one on mine.

1098
00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:14.848
You know why?

1099
00:51:14.892 --> 00:51:16.545
Because I trust you.

1100
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:18.504
I'm not hiding anything.

1101
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:20.462
- Tweety108.

1102
00:51:21.507 --> 00:51:22.987
- Your kid sister.

1103
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.726
- Yes.

1104
00:51:31.909 --> 00:51:33.823
- Man don't Tiffany got
anything better than do,


1105
00:51:33.867 --> 00:51:36.957
she got some studying
or something?


1106
00:51:37.001 --> 00:51:39.525
Man she all hyped about
this step show tonight.


1107
00:51:39.568 --> 00:51:43.181
- You'd be surprised
she studies hard.


1108
00:51:43.224 --> 00:51:44.965
She made the Dean's List.

1109
00:51:45.009 --> 00:51:46.880
She just party's harder.

1110
00:51:48.099 --> 00:51:50.144
- If you say so.

1111
00:51:50.188 --> 00:51:52.320
Who is Simon Taylor?

1112
00:51:52.364 --> 00:51:53.887
- My math tutor, why?

1113
00:51:55.149 --> 00:51:57.195
- Because he called
you yesterday at noon.


1114
00:51:57.238 --> 00:51:58.413
- Yeah, he was trying to see

1115
00:51:58.457 --> 00:52:00.589
which part of the
library to meet up at.


1116
00:52:00.633 --> 00:52:01.982
- Who's Kevin Smith?

1117
00:52:02.026 --> 00:52:04.724
He called you a couple
times on Monday.


1118
00:52:04.767 --> 00:52:06.900
- He is just my friend.

1119
00:52:06.944 --> 00:52:08.075
- Friend.

1120
00:52:08.119 --> 00:52:10.512
- Yes, we are just friends.

1121

that I don't know about.

just makes jokes.

1277
01:01:47.088 --> 01:01:50.439
- I don't know what
I wanna listen to.


1278
01:01:50.483 --> 01:01:52.703
- [Jasmine] What the heck
happened to your arm?


1279
01:01:52.746 --> 01:01:54.879
- Look it's nothing,
it's my fault.


1280
01:01:54.922 --> 01:01:57.621
- You better tell me
what happened before
I go to the cops.


1281
01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:02.408
- Ben asked me very
nicely to stop talking


1282
01:02:02.451 --> 01:02:03.844
to other guys on campus

1283
01:02:03.888 --> 01:02:05.019
and I didn't listen.

1284
01:02:05.063 --> 01:02:06.543
- So what?

1285
01:02:06.586 --> 01:02:09.894
That's called manipulative
and being controlling.


1286
01:02:10.808 --> 01:02:11.591
- I know.

1287
01:02:12.766 --> 01:02:14.986
- Come on Stacey.

1288
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.726
- I know.

1289
01:02:17.292 --> 01:02:21.122
I'm gonna go talk to the
professor, I promise.


1290
01:02:21.166 --> 01:02:23.690
- You better 'cause
if you don't I will.


1291
01:02:23.734 --> 01:02:24.952
And I mean that.

1292
01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:30.523
I can't believe him.

1293
01:02:32.003 --> 01:02:35.049
- Well good morning, this
is a pleasant surprise.


1294
01:02:35.093 --> 01:02:37.922
- Good morning, 
Professor James.

1295
01:02:37.965 --> 01:02:41.229
I was wondering if I could
talk to you about something.


1296
01:02:41.273 --> 01:02:43.144
Sure but if this is
about your last grade


1297
01:02:43.188 --> 01:02:44.537
I'm sorry I can't change that.

1298
01:02:44.581 --> 01:02:46.931
You had quite a few
grammatical errors.


1299
01:02:46.974 --> 01:02:49.368
- No sir, it's not about that.

1300
01:02:50.978 --> 01:02:53.067
It's about Benjamin and I.

1301
01:02:54.808 --> 01:02:59.247
I've been dating your graduate
assistant Benjamin Williams.


1302
01:02:59.291 --> 01:03:00.509
- Yeah, I'm aware.

1303
01:03:02.076 --> 01:03:05.036
- Well, we've been having a few
problems in our relationship


1304
01:03:05.079 --> 01:03:07.952
and I just wanted
your advice on it.


1305
01:03:09.518 --> 01:03:12.478
- What kind of problems Stacey?

1306
01:03:12.521 --> 01:03:16.482
- Well, Benjamin and I
have fun for the most part


1307
01:03:18.745 --> 01:03:21.574
we have a great time together

1308
01:03:21.618 --> 01:03:24.359
but when things
just don't go right


1309
01:03:26.405 --> 01:03:28.146
and everything's not going well

1310
01:03:28.189 --> 01:03:30.627
it just gets so bad so fast.

1311
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:34.065
And I guess what
I'm trying to say


1312
01:03:34.108 --> 01:03:37.677
is that I think he
has anger issues


1313
01:03:37.721 --> 01:03:39.461
but something he just
can't control it.


1314
01:03:39.505 --> 01:03:40.245
- Stop.

1315
01:03:41.507 --> 01:03:44.858
Is he putting his hands on you?

1316
01:03:44.902 --> 01:03:45.642
- Yes.

1317
01:03:47.426 --> 01:03:49.428
- Are you afraid of him?

1318
01:03:51.082 --> 01:03:53.432
- Professor James I don't
wanna get him in trouble.


1319
01:03:53.475 --> 01:03:57.262
- Listen, if he's
putting his hands on you


1320
01:03:57.305 --> 01:03:59.090
and causing you bodily
harm you know things


1321
01:03:59.133 --> 01:04:02.136
can progress worse
than that, right?


1322
01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.008
And you shouldn't be with him.

1323
01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:04.791
- No.

1324
01:04:07.664 --> 01:04:10.667
- Stacey, I'm gonna
give you a number


1325
01:04:11.972 --> 01:04:15.715
to a very good friend
of my across the hall


1326
01:04:15.759 --> 01:04:17.630
in the next building.

1327
01:04:17.674 --> 01:04:19.893
You call her, okay.

1328
01:04:19.937 --> 01:04:24.419
And she can give you the next
step that you need to take.


1329
01:04:25.943 --> 01:04:29.120
I really appreciate you
bringing this information to me.


1330
01:04:29.163 --> 01:04:32.166
- Thank you so much
Professor James.


1331
01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:33.124
- Thank you.

1332
01:04:36.562 --> 01:04:39.434
You gonna be okay
I promise you that.


1333
01:04:39.478 --> 01:04:40.261
- Okay.

1334
01:04:40.305 --> 01:04:41.828
- Call her now.

1335
01:04:41.872 --> 01:04:42.655
- I will.

1336
01:04:42.699 --> 01:04:43.438
- Okay.

1337
01:04:49.749 --> 01:04:51.098
- [Benjamin] You
wanted to see me sir.


1338
01:04:51.142 --> 01:04:51.882
- Oh, yeah.

1339
01:04:53.274 --> 01:04:56.887
First you are no longer
my graduate assistant,


1340
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:58.149
do you understand?

1341
01:04:58.192 --> 01:04:59.367
I don't wanna see
you in my class.


1342
01:04:59.411 --> 01:05:00.673
I don't wanna see
you on this campus.


1343
01:05:00.717 --> 01:05:02.022
And I definitely don't
wanna see you around


1344
01:05:02.066 --> 01:05:03.807
any of my students
anymore, you understand me?


1345
01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:07.288
- What, what, what,
where's this coming from?


1346
01:05:07.332 --> 01:05:08.507
- Mr. Benjamin,
you put your hands


1347
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:10.291
on any young girls lately?

1348
01:05:10.335 --> 01:05:12.729
- Look, look Professor
whatever she told you


1349
01:05:12.772 --> 01:05:14.078
look I can explain.

1350
01:05:14.121 --> 01:05:15.819
- Whoa, ain't no need.

1351
01:05:18.212 --> 01:05:20.084
I'm sure if pick up
my phone right now


1352
01:05:20.127 --> 01:05:22.477
and call any of
your ex-girlfriends


1353
01:05:22.521 --> 01:05:25.306
they all have very
similar stories.


1354
01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:28.483
Do you catch where
I'm coming from?


1355
01:05:28.527 --> 01:05:31.791
Look Benjamin, listen
to me carefully dog


1356
01:05:33.619 --> 01:05:37.318
go get you some help
but get out of my class.


1357
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:41.845
- You don't want me to
get the laws involved.


1358
01:05:41.888 --> 01:05:43.716
Do I make myself clear?

1359
01:05:46.588 --> 01:05:48.808
Do I make myself clear?

1360
01:05:48.852 --> 01:05:50.157
- Got it.

1361
01:05:50.201 --> 01:05:50.941
- Good.

1362
01:05:53.334 --> 01:05:56.294
And leave my
credentials at my door.


1363
01:06:02.866 --> 01:06:05.129
- I'm about to hang up.

1364
01:06:05.172 --> 01:06:06.217
For real I am.

1365
01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:11.788
Why didn't you hang up?

1366
01:06:14.747 --> 01:06:17.358
Why didn't you hang up?

1367
01:06:17.402 --> 01:06:18.707
No babe, you.

1368
01:06:18.751 --> 01:06:21.885
- Girl if you don't
get off that phone.


1369
01:06:21.928 --> 01:06:24.017
- Okay babe I gotta go for real.

1370
01:06:24.061 --> 01:06:25.236
Yes.

1371
01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:26.498
I love you too.

1372
01:06:26.541 --> 01:06:28.152
I love you, I love
you, I love you.


1373
01:06:28.195 --> 01:06:31.155
[lips smacking]

1374
01:06:31.198 --> 01:06:33.940
Excuse me somebody's a hater.

1375
01:06:33.984 --> 01:06:36.116
- Please, do you
wanna see my phone?


1376
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.552
I keep a rotation.

1377
01:06:38.423 --> 01:06:39.337
- Whatever.

1378
01:06:42.949 --> 01:06:44.646
What's up Stac?

1379
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:46.735
How are you and Benji?

1380
01:06:46.779 --> 01:06:49.086
- Girl not good right now.

1381
01:06:49.129 --> 01:06:51.740
[door knocking]

1382
01:06:58.617 --> 01:07:00.532
- Speak of the devil.

1383
01:07:00.575 --> 01:07:02.882
It's Benjamin at the door.

1384
01:07:02.926 --> 01:07:04.405
Should I answer it?

1385
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:06.973
All right.

1386
01:07:17.027 --> 01:07:18.767
- [Benjamin] What's up Tiff?

1387
01:07:18.811 --> 01:07:19.986
- [Tiffany] Hey.

1388
01:07:22.641 --> 01:07:23.468
- Jas.

1389
01:07:29.822 --> 01:07:30.867
Hello Stacey.

1390
01:07:32.129 --> 01:07:33.695
- Hello.

1391
01:07:33.739 --> 01:07:36.002
- Can we talk alone?

1392
01:07:36.046 --> 01:07:37.047
- Whatever you have to say to me

1393
01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:38.439
you can say in front--

1394
01:07:38.483 --> 01:07:39.832
- Man, you haven't
answered my calls or texts.


1395
01:07:39.876 --> 01:07:42.574
- So what does that tell you?

1396
01:07:42.617 --> 01:07:46.621
- And I have somethin'
important to talk to you about.


1397
01:07:46.665 --> 01:07:49.059
Can we talk in private please?

1398
01:07:53.367 --> 01:07:55.761
- Look you have five minutes.

1399
01:08:15.476 --> 01:08:16.564
- I'm so sick of him.

1400
01:08:16.608 --> 01:08:18.827
- He's so fucking rude.

1401
01:08:18.871 --> 01:08:20.873
[groans]

1402
01:08:23.963 --> 01:08:26.574
- What the hell you doing
going to Professor James?


1403
01:08:26.618 --> 01:08:29.360
Don't you know I lost my
[mumbles] 'cause of you.


1404
01:08:29.403 --> 01:08:30.143
Huh?

1405
01:08:32.406 --> 01:08:33.625
Shut up.

1406
01:08:33.668 --> 01:08:35.018
Now you listen to me.

1407
01:08:35.061 --> 01:08:36.454
Listen to me.

1408
01:08:36.497 --> 01:08:40.110
Snitches get stitches,
you understand me?


1409
01:08:40.153 --> 01:08:41.111
Huh?

1410
01:08:41.154 --> 01:08:43.678
Don't nobody love you like I do.

1411
01:08:45.028 --> 01:08:46.681
Look at you.

1412
01:08:46.725 --> 01:08:50.729
You're fat, you're ugly,
and you ain't that smart.


1413
01:08:52.644 --> 01:08:53.471
Come here.

1414
01:08:56.213 --> 01:08:58.606
This is your fault, not mine.

1415
01:09:02.654 --> 01:09:04.786
[crying]

1416
01:09:26.765 --> 01:09:27.766
- Oh my God.

1417
01:09:28.767 --> 01:09:30.160
Everything's gonna be okay.

1418
01:09:30.203 --> 01:09:31.509
Wait, just try not to move.

1419
01:09:31.552 --> 01:09:32.379
Call the police.

1420
01:09:32.423 --> 01:09:33.685
- [Tiffany] Okay.

1421
01:09:59.841 --> 01:10:01.017
- [mumbles].

1422
01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.367
- [mumbles].

1423
01:10:05.891 --> 01:10:07.675
- That's him right there.

1424
01:10:07.719 --> 01:10:09.068
Excuse me.

1425
01:10:09.112 --> 01:10:09.851
Runner.

1426
01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:13.464
Are you Benjamin Williams?

1427
01:10:16.162 --> 01:10:17.468
- Yes.

1428
01:10:17.511 --> 01:10:19.861
- This is Officer Smith,
I'm Officer Johnson,


1429
01:10:19.905 --> 01:10:22.255
we're from the Texas
Central Campus Police.


1430
01:10:22.299 --> 01:10:23.735
Show me some ID.

1431
01:10:23.778 --> 01:10:25.519
- May I ask why?

1432
01:10:25.563 --> 01:10:26.999
- You don't know.

1433
01:10:27.043 --> 01:10:29.001
Didn't do your best
impression of Ike Turner


1434
01:10:29.045 --> 01:10:32.222
on your girlfriend
just yesterday?


1435
01:10:32.265 --> 01:10:33.919
- Man I don't know what
you're talking about.


1436
01:10:33.962 --> 01:10:35.181
[laughing]

1437
01:10:35.225 --> 01:10:36.835
- Yeah.

1438
01:10:36.878 --> 01:10:38.402
- Let me see your hand.

1439
01:10:38.445 --> 01:10:40.273
- Look is this really necessary?

1440
01:10:40.317 --> 01:10:43.146
- From the looks of your
girlfriend it's necessary.


1441
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:45.452
Now show me your right hand.

1442
01:10:45.496 --> 01:10:46.845
I won't ask again.

1443
01:10:49.978 --> 01:10:52.764
What happened to
your right hand?


1444
01:10:52.807 --> 01:10:54.244
- I don't remember.

1445
01:10:54.287 --> 01:10:55.593
- He don't remember Smith.

1446
01:10:55.636 --> 01:10:58.465
- So you don't remember
boxing your girlfriend?


1447
01:10:58.509 --> 01:11:00.424
- Man, look whatever
she told you.


1448
01:11:00.467 --> 01:11:02.556
- What?
- I ain't do nothing.


1449
01:11:03.992 --> 01:11:06.038
- Yeah get him
down, get him down.


1450
01:11:06.082 --> 01:11:07.518
Put your hands behind your back.

1451
01:11:07.561 --> 01:11:09.955
You're being arrested
for assault and battery.


1452
01:11:09.998 --> 01:11:11.087
- Really.
- Yep.


1453
01:11:13.089 --> 01:11:15.526
- What, come on man really?

1454
01:11:15.569 --> 01:11:17.267
- [Officer Johnson]
Oh, yeah really.


1455
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:19.312
- That's all right I'll
be out in the morning.


1456
01:11:19.356 --> 01:11:21.401
- Yeah right, well
tell it to the judge.


1457
01:11:21.445 --> 01:11:23.186
- Pretty boy think you
gonna be out in the morning.


1458
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:24.274
- Right.
- That's funny.


1459
01:11:24.317 --> 01:11:26.406
[laughing]

1460
01:11:39.158 --> 01:11:41.943
- Got me up that this
jail early this morning.


1461
01:11:41.987 --> 01:11:44.337
What if I had warrants?

1462
01:11:44.381 --> 01:11:47.384
I tell yam you don't think
about no one but yourself


1463
01:11:47.427 --> 01:11:50.082
just like your daddy.
- Mom, I didn't do it.


1464
01:11:50.126 --> 01:11:51.127
- Yes you did!

1465
01:11:52.911 --> 01:11:54.347
Now you just cut out
all this foolishness


1466
01:11:54.391 --> 01:11:56.871
and control your temper.

1467
01:11:56.915 --> 01:11:57.872
You gonna touch the wrong girl

1468
01:11:57.916 --> 01:12:00.440
somethin' gonna happen to you.

1469
01:12:00.484 --> 01:12:02.138
Go on get in this car.

1470
01:12:07.143 --> 01:12:10.233
- Would you like
some coffee or water?


1471
01:12:11.973 --> 01:12:13.671
- I'm okay.

1472
01:12:13.714 --> 01:12:16.500
- So tell me, how
you feeling dear?


1473
01:12:21.244 --> 01:12:24.638
- I'm just trying
to get through it.


1474
01:12:24.682 --> 01:12:28.642
- Have you gone through
domestic violence before?


1475
01:12:28.686 --> 01:12:29.426
- No.

1476
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:36.911
And I never thought
that I would have to


1477
01:12:36.955 --> 01:12:39.479
because I'm smarter than that.

1478
01:12:39.523 --> 01:12:42.743
- You are, you are a
smart strong woman.


1479
01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.273
- It doesn't feel like it.

1480
01:12:54.102 --> 01:12:57.497
- Stacey, a lot of
women don't tell anyone


1481
01:12:59.586 --> 01:13:01.588
for months or even years.

1482
01:13:02.763 --> 01:13:04.461
This is why I'm really happy

1483
01:13:04.504 --> 01:13:07.290
that you did go
to the professor.


1484
01:13:07.333 --> 01:13:09.379
Have you told anyone else?

1485
01:13:13.252 --> 01:13:16.690
- No one else knows
besides my two friends


1486
01:13:17.604 --> 01:13:20.085
at school Jasmine and Tiffany.

1487
01:13:22.435 --> 01:13:26.004
- Why haven't you
told your parents?


1488
01:13:26.047 --> 01:13:27.571
- I can't tell them.

1489
01:13:29.964 --> 01:13:31.705
My parents won't understand

1490
01:13:31.749 --> 01:13:35.492
and they would never let
me out of their sight.


1491
01:13:43.543 --> 01:13:47.634
- You have absolutely nothing
to be embarrassed about.


1492
01:13:47.678 --> 01:13:49.897
- But I do feel embarrassed.

1493
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:54.685
- I mean after all that
is what family is for.


1494
01:13:54.728 --> 01:13:59.342
I'm sure that they love you
and care about you very much.


1495
01:14:00.778 --> 01:14:04.303
And I would encourage
you to talk to them.


1496
01:14:04.347 --> 01:14:07.088
- But what about
my little sister,


1497
01:14:07.132 --> 01:14:11.441
she's only 16-years-old
and she look up to me,


1498
01:14:11.484 --> 01:14:13.356
what is she gonna think?

1499
01:14:14.748 --> 01:14:18.361
- She'll probably
think I'm really proud


1500
01:14:18.404 --> 01:14:20.319
of my big sister for one.

1501
01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.975
And she may feel
anger or sadness


1502
01:14:28.022 --> 01:14:31.243
but mostly she would
probably be relieved.


1503
01:14:31.287 --> 01:14:32.505
- Relieved.

1504
01:14:32.549 --> 01:14:33.767
- Yes, relieved.

1505
01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.992
You see I don't know if
you realize this or not


1506
01:14:41.035 --> 01:14:44.822
but you are teaching her
a very valuable lesson.


1507
01:14:46.084 --> 01:14:49.870
Your courage is showing
her what to look for


1508
01:14:49.914 --> 01:14:52.830
in men like that in
any relationship.


1509
01:14:56.486 --> 01:14:59.315
- I never thought
of it like that.


1510
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:05.408
- Stacey, do you think
it was your fault


1511
01:15:05.451 --> 01:15:07.714
that he put his hands on you?

1512
01:15:09.281 --> 01:15:10.587
- Sometimes yes.

1513
01:15:14.504 --> 01:15:18.290
Sometimes I believe that
if I would just wear


1514
01:15:19.987 --> 01:15:24.122
what he wants me to wear
everything would be okay.


1515
01:15:25.558 --> 01:15:28.126
If I just bend to his will

1516
01:15:28.169 --> 01:15:30.433
that everything will be okay.

1517
01:15:33.044 --> 01:15:36.656
- Stacey, as a survivor
of domestic violence


1518
01:15:41.052 --> 01:15:42.532
I'm here to tell you right now

1519
01:15:42.575 --> 01:15:46.797
that everyone and I
mean every single person


1520
01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.582
is responsible for
their own behavior.


1521
01:15:49.626 --> 01:15:54.500
They're accountable for their
own actions and reactions.


1522
01:15:54.544 --> 01:15:56.850
Especially men like Benjamin.

1523
01:15:58.461 --> 01:16:00.593
I know his kind very well.

1524
01:16:04.815 --> 01:16:08.209
But I want you to
walk away today,


1525
01:16:08.253 --> 01:16:11.256
I want you to know,
I need you to know


1526
01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.347
that this is not your fault.

1527
01:16:16.914 --> 01:16:19.133
It is not your fault, okay.

1528
01:16:21.179 --> 01:16:22.006
- Okay.

1529
01:16:23.181 --> 01:16:25.618
- Say it, it is not my fault.

1530
01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:33.321
- This is not my fault.

1531
01:16:35.236 --> 01:16:37.064
- Say it again Stacey.

1532
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:46.552
- This is not my fault.

1533
01:16:46.596 --> 01:16:48.772
- [Counselor] Again, Stacey.

1534
01:16:52.123 --> 01:16:53.994
- This is not my fault.

1535
01:16:56.867 --> 01:17:01.262
- And it's not baby girl,
it is not your fault, okay.


1536
01:17:02.612 --> 01:17:05.484
Listen I have card
I wanna give you


1537
01:17:08.052 --> 01:17:09.532
there's some information on here

1538
01:17:09.575 --> 01:17:13.405
about a group for victims
of domestic violence


1539
01:17:13.449 --> 01:17:16.626
I think it would help
with your healing.


1540
01:17:23.154 --> 01:17:24.155
- Thank you.

1541
01:17:25.417 --> 01:17:26.636
- Your welcome.

1542
01:17:27.941 --> 01:17:30.204
It'll be better, I promise.

1543
01:17:35.471 --> 01:17:38.212
[dramatic music]

1544
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:44.654
[group chattering]

1545
01:17:48.788 --> 01:17:51.008
- Sweetheart, what's wrong.

1546
01:17:56.317 --> 01:18:00.496
I can tell something's
bothering you, is it school?


1547
01:18:02.715 --> 01:18:04.021
What's going on?

1548
01:18:07.503 --> 01:18:09.461
- It's about Benjamin.

1549
01:18:09.505 --> 01:18:11.898
- Benjamin and you
are not getting along.


1550
01:18:11.942 --> 01:18:15.162
Couples do argue from
time to time baby.


1551
01:18:16.642 --> 01:18:20.603
- It's grown to much
more than that Mom.


1552
01:18:20.646 --> 01:18:23.606
He used to be so
nice and considerate


1553
01:18:26.434 --> 01:18:30.351
then he started to get
upset and possessive


1554
01:18:30.395 --> 01:18:33.746
and he even wanted to
know who, where, when


1555
01:18:35.052 --> 01:18:38.316
or why I need to hang
out with my own friends.


1556
01:18:38.359 --> 01:18:42.189
- Wait, has he started
putting his hands on you?


1557
01:18:44.191 --> 01:18:45.889
- I'm going to kill him.

1558
01:18:45.932 --> 01:18:47.586
- Nah, baby girl you
not gonna do anything


1559
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:49.545
because I'm going to kill him.

1560
01:18:49.588 --> 01:18:53.461
- Wait, we don't need any
family members in jail.


1561
01:18:54.941 --> 01:18:57.640
We're gonna let the police
deal with this misguided soul.


1562
01:18:57.683 --> 01:19:00.773
- Why didn't you come to us?

1563
01:19:00.817 --> 01:19:03.341
- I thought I could handle it.

1564
01:19:03.384 --> 01:19:05.561
I thought I could change him.

1565
01:19:05.604 --> 01:19:08.738
- You don't have to handle
these things by yourself.


1566
01:19:08.781 --> 01:19:10.827
That's what family is for.

1567
01:19:13.873 --> 01:19:17.311
- I'm so sorry I let
you down little sis.


1568
01:19:18.356 --> 01:19:20.663
- I'm learning just like you.

1569
01:19:22.273 --> 01:19:24.101
You never let me down.

1570
01:19:25.145 --> 01:19:26.494
You're so brave.

1571
01:19:28.105 --> 01:19:29.367
You're my hero.

1572
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:34.154
- We're gonna get through
this together as a family.


1573
01:19:34.198 --> 01:19:37.288
And I want you to know that
you wasn't dealing with a man


1574
01:19:37.331 --> 01:19:39.551
that's a boy, a damn coward.

1575
01:19:40.421 --> 01:19:42.554
I don't care how old you are

1576
01:19:42.598 --> 01:19:46.906
anyone who prays on the
defenseless is a coward.


1577
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:50.040
- I'm just glad that you
found out about him now


1578
01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:53.783
rather than years
later after a baby


1579
01:19:53.826 --> 01:19:56.220
and after he stole your youth.

1580
01:19:56.263 --> 01:19:58.439
- [Stacey] Right Mom.

1581
01:19:58.483 --> 01:20:00.572
- We're here for you baby.

1582
01:20:03.836 --> 01:20:07.057
Your family is here for you.

1583
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.536
It's gonna be okay.

1584
01:20:17.328 --> 01:20:21.071
- Good evening ladies,
thank you for coming out.


1585
01:20:21.114 --> 01:20:23.377
We have a new member
with us today,


1586
01:20:23.421 --> 01:20:25.292
her name is Stacey.

1587
01:20:25.336 --> 01:20:27.599
- [Group] Hi, Stacey.

1588
01:20:27.643 --> 01:20:28.382
- Hi.

1589
01:20:29.906 --> 01:20:32.648
- Thank you for
coming out Stacey.


1590
01:20:33.605 --> 01:20:35.651
Who wants to share first?

1591
01:20:38.958 --> 01:20:39.698
Demetria.

1592
01:20:43.571 --> 01:20:46.792
- How could someone
that I love beat me?


1593
01:20:52.537 --> 01:20:53.973
He was my husband.

1594
01:20:57.411 --> 01:21:00.545
I cooked, cleaned,
ironed his clothes,


1595
01:21:06.203 --> 01:21:08.335
and I even stayed with him

1596
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:14.646
after he had a baby
outside of our marriage.


1597
01:21:25.831 --> 01:21:28.051
He had my mind and my heart

1598
01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:36.276
and he purposely [mumbles].

1599
01:21:45.938 --> 01:21:47.984
[crying]

1600
01:21:55.252 --> 01:21:57.907
- Thank you for
sharing Demetria.


1601
01:22:06.306 --> 01:22:07.133
- Hi.

1602
01:22:08.395 --> 01:22:09.745
- Hi.

1603
01:22:09.788 --> 01:22:13.531
- I hope being here
today helped you.


1604
01:22:13.574 --> 01:22:16.752
- It did but I kinda feel bad

1605
01:22:16.795 --> 01:22:19.580
'cause I didn't get a
chance to tell my story.


1606
01:22:19.624 --> 01:22:22.148
- Everyone doesn't tell
their story on the first day.


1607
01:22:22.192 --> 01:22:24.803
And Mrs. Rose
doesn't push you to.


1608
01:22:24.847 --> 01:22:28.502
I was here about a week
before I told my story.


1609
01:22:28.546 --> 01:22:31.462
I guess it's similar to yours.

1610
01:22:31.505 --> 01:22:35.118
- Why would you say
something like that.


1611
01:22:35.161 --> 01:22:37.773
- I dated Benjamin
last semester.


1612
01:22:39.775 --> 01:22:41.820
And I've seen you two
hanging around campus


1613
01:22:41.864 --> 01:22:46.259
and I can only imagine
what he's done to you.


1614
01:22:46.303 --> 01:22:48.740
- Did you go to the police?

1615
01:22:48.784 --> 01:22:51.874
- No, I was embarrassed
to tell anybody.


1616
01:22:53.179 --> 01:22:56.269
My family and friends
they all loved him.


1617
01:22:56.313 --> 01:22:58.228
He was so charming.

1618
01:22:58.271 --> 01:23:00.534
But I had this one close
cousin she knew the truth


1619
01:23:00.578 --> 01:23:03.320
and she saw right through him.

1620
01:23:03.363 --> 01:23:06.410
- How did you get him to stop?

1621
01:23:06.453 --> 01:23:09.979
- The last time I saw
him he beat me so bad.


1622
01:23:11.241 --> 01:23:12.851
- Answer me when
I'm talking to you!


1623
01:23:12.895 --> 01:23:15.941
- I just stopped answer
the phone, text messages


1624
01:23:15.985 --> 01:23:19.771
but it took him about a
month to get the point.


1625
01:23:22.905 --> 01:23:25.864
- In time do you think we
will ever be able to heal


1626
01:23:25.908 --> 01:23:27.474
from this situation?

1627
01:23:28.649 --> 01:23:31.565
- I think so
as long as we learn

1628
01:23:31.609 --> 01:23:34.917
from this relationship
we'll be all right.


1629
01:23:36.048 --> 01:23:37.267
- You're right.

1630
01:23:38.659 --> 01:23:42.359
- Hey, here's my card
whenever you wanna talk


1631
01:23:44.187 --> 01:23:45.405
just hit me up.

1632
01:23:46.798 --> 01:23:47.799
- Thank you.

1633
01:23:49.801 --> 01:23:52.978
- So I'll be seeing you
again next Thursday.


1634
01:23:53.022 --> 01:23:53.718
- Yeah.

1635
01:24:10.953 --> 01:24:13.259
- And don't think I
ain't see you talk


1636
01:24:13.303 --> 01:24:15.305
to that dude in the cafeteria.

1637
01:24:15.348 --> 01:24:16.828
- Who David?

1638
01:24:16.872 --> 01:24:19.657
I told you he's dating
one of my line sisters.


1639
01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.877
Babe you really gotta chill.

1640
01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.966
- Watch your tongue when
you're talking to me.


1641
01:24:24.009 --> 01:24:25.793
And slow down that walk.

1642
01:24:25.837 --> 01:24:27.839
You walking too fast.

1643
01:24:27.883 --> 01:24:29.058
Stay on my hip.

1644
01:24:34.585 --> 01:24:36.717
And stop poppin' that gum.

1645
01:24:38.763 --> 01:24:40.025
It's disrespectful.

1646
01:24:40.069 --> 01:24:40.983
Give it here.

1647
01:24:51.167 --> 01:24:53.212
[crying]

1648
01:24:57.477 --> 01:24:59.305
Now you quit all that
crying and go in there


1649
01:24:59.349 --> 01:25:01.177
and clean yourself up.

1650
01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:03.657
And you better be
here when I get back.


1651
01:25:03.701 --> 01:25:05.659
[crying]

1652
01:25:13.363 --> 01:25:16.279
[dramatic music]

1653
01:25:16.322 --> 01:25:18.455
[blooping]

1654
01:25:28.117 --> 01:25:30.336
[blooping]

1655
01:25:31.468 --> 01:25:33.731
[blooping]

1656
01:25:39.215 --> 01:25:42.914
- I'm about to go to my
car to get my biology book.


1657
01:25:42.958 --> 01:25:43.784
- Hurry up.

1658
01:26:05.545 --> 01:26:07.460
- What you want it for?

1659
01:26:09.549 --> 01:26:13.466
Look you get caught with
this you don't know me.


1660
01:26:27.132 --> 01:26:29.569
Hey, this is what you load it.

1661
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:51.330
[gun bangs]

1662
01:26:51.374 --> 01:26:53.506
