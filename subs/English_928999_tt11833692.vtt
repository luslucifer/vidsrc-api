00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.999
Uh, howdy, pilgrim.

[grunts]

5
00:01:55.637 --> 00:01:56.939
Thought you were dead.

6
00:01:56.973 --> 00:01:59.809
[chuckles] Not hardly.

7
00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:02.344
[man 1] Hey, hey.
Is that kid cheating?


8
00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:04.847
- [man 2] I bet he palmed it.
- [man 1] Stand up, boy.


9
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:08.450
There's a kid in the saloon skinning
everybody at the poker table.


10
00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:11.386
- [man 1] Get back here.
- [door opens]


11
00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:12.654
[man 1] I'm talking to you.

12
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:26.501
Hey, kid.

13
00:02:29.672 --> 00:02:30.840
You palmed that card.

14
00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:33.341
[laughs]

15
00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:34.643
That's a sorry excuse

16
00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:36.078
for losing to a kid.

17
00:02:36.112 --> 00:02:37.546
Own up.

18
00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.382
I'm tired of talking.

19
00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.450
Look, mister,
if you don't know how to play,


20
00:02:42.484 --> 00:02:43.986
don't put up the money.

21
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.455
If you don't draw first, I will.

22
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.429

- [horse whinnies]


24
00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:07.910
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25
00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:11.781
Easy now.

26
00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:32.068
How old are you, kid?

27
00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:34.670
Seventeen.

28
00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:37.505
Seventeen.

29
00:03:47.683 --> 00:03:49.785
Did you palm that card?

30
00:03:54.757 --> 00:03:57.693
I don't think I'm gonna
let you boys kill a kid today.


31
00:03:58.828 --> 00:04:00.730
Who the hell are you?

32
00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:21.549
[groans]

33
00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:27.455
[breathing heavily]

34
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.467
Is there a doc?

35
00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:42.038
Yeah. Grab your horse.

36
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:44.106
Doc's about a quarter mile away.

37
00:04:52.114 --> 00:04:54.150
[groaning]

38
00:04:59.956 --> 00:05:04.260
[grunting]

39
00:05:04.293 --> 00:05:06.528
- That bullet.
- [grunting]


40
00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:09.631
[doctor]
Well, you're pretty lucky.


41
00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:14.203
Two more inches and that bullet would
have ripped through your spleen,


42
00:05:14.236 --> 00:05:17.673
your stomach, and your ribcage.

43
00:05:17.707 --> 00:05:22.644
But you just got a flesh wound.

44
00:05:22.678 --> 00:05:24.612
[mutters]
Oh, my God.


45
00:05:24.646 --> 00:05:27.917
It feels a lot more than
just a flesh wound.


46
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.686
[panting]

47
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.654
What kind of doctor are you?

48
00:05:33.956 --> 00:05:37.159
I'm a practitioner of dentistry.

49
00:05:39.328 --> 00:05:45.301
But I was a surgeon...
in the 5th Texas Infantry


50
00:05:45.334 --> 00:05:47.635
during the War of
Northern Aggression.


51
00:05:50.638 --> 00:05:52.908
I saw the amputations pile up.

52
00:05:52.942 --> 00:05:55.610
Chancellorsville, Gettysburg...

53
00:05:58.047 --> 00:06:00.850
and a dozen battles thereafter.

54
00:06:00.883 --> 00:06:02.118
Here, drink some of that.

55
00:06:04.652 --> 00:06:05.755
[grunts]

56
00:06:07.256 --> 00:06:08.523
[doctor] Yeah.

57
00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:14.930
I, uh, heard you say
you saved that kid's life.


58
00:06:16.232 --> 00:06:18.000
I'm not sure what he was up to,

59
00:06:18.034 --> 00:06:22.872
but nothing but moonshine
and trouble in that saloon.


60
00:06:22.905 --> 00:06:26.608
And I don't think that he is man
enough for either one of 'em.


61
00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:29.178
[grunts] Yeah.

62
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:31.113
Yeah, you know how kids are.

63
00:06:31.147 --> 00:06:34.016
They're always getting
into trouble.


64
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.721
Yeah.
Judging by the scars on you,


65
00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:42.725
seems to me you might have been
the same kind of kid yourself.


66
00:06:42.758 --> 00:06:46.796
He's gonna have more problems
with the sheriff.


67
00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:48.230
Now, he saved the kid,

68
00:06:48.264 --> 00:06:51.667
but he shot three people,
including Ben Casey.


69
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.568
He shot Ben Casey?

70
00:06:54.837 --> 00:06:56.172
Sure enough.

71
00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:57.807
Shot him right in the chest.

72
00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:00.943
Ben Casey.

73
00:07:02.311 --> 00:07:05.681
Well, he and that crowd
he hung around with,


74
00:07:05.714 --> 00:07:06.982
they were no good anyway.

75
00:07:07.016 --> 00:07:08.650
[clears throat]

76
00:07:08.684 --> 00:07:10.719
About time
somebody brought 'em down.


77
00:07:12.054 --> 00:07:14.156
Ain't nothing wrong
with taking the law


78
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.759
in your own hands
if they're deserving.


79
00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:20.830
I ain't never seen
anybody faster.


80
00:07:20.863 --> 00:07:23.265
But that sheriff's
gonna look for him.


81
00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:26.769
One of the boys he shot
was kin to the sheriff.


82
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.006
Well, you know, Lindstrom,

83
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.111
the sheriff and I go way back
to the war of secession.


84
00:07:35.144 --> 00:07:37.113
We were in
Hood's Brigade together.


85
00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:40.082
So, I'll make it right with him
when he gets back.


86
00:07:40.116 --> 00:07:41.217
Don't you worry.

87
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.985
[chuckles]

88
00:07:43.018 --> 00:07:45.888
I appreciate that.
[winces]


89
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:47.823
I don't want any...
I don't want any trouble.


90
00:07:49.058 --> 00:07:51.327
I'm just curious.

91
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.364
What exactly were you doing
passing through town?


92
00:07:55.397 --> 00:07:57.632
[grunting]

93
00:07:59.702 --> 00:08:03.272
I was just going to see
some old friends. Figured...


94
00:08:03.305 --> 00:08:04.707
[grunting]

95
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.444
Yeah, well, if you
keep up these gun fights,


96
00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:13.349
you won't be doing any visiting or
jawing with old friends, that's for sure.


97
00:08:13.382 --> 00:08:18.154
Accept my apologies,
but this may hurt.


98
00:08:18.854 --> 00:08:20.823
[grunting]

99
00:08:20.856 --> 00:08:22.992
- Oh, God!
- [cup clatters]


100
00:08:28.197 --> 00:08:31.167
I didn't think
he'd be out for so long.


101
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.435
Well, maybe he's just resting.

102
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:37.039
Looking at all those scars,
there's a long history on that man.


103
00:08:37.072 --> 00:08:39.775
A lot of men
pass through this town.


104
00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:41.076
A lot of stories.

105
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.446
Some true,
some worse than others.


106
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.382
Well, I don't know
how many more stories


107
00:08:46.415 --> 00:08:48.918
Kansas is gonna have
if he keeps this up.


108
00:08:50.753 --> 00:08:52.721
Hoo... hooch is wearing off.

109
00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:54.390
[groaning]

110
00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.326
You got some good stuff, Doc.

111
00:08:57.359 --> 00:08:58.827
I might have to try that.

112
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:01.163
Medicinal purposes only, Lind.

113
00:09:09.371 --> 00:09:12.341
Where's my gun?
What did you do with my gun?


114
00:09:12.374 --> 00:09:13.442
Right there, right there,
right there.


115
00:09:13.475 --> 00:09:14.910
I
-I took the liberty

116
00:09:14.944 --> 00:09:18.280
of cleaning it
and oiling it for you.


117
00:09:18.314 --> 00:09:23.419
You never know how patients
are gonna react after surgery.


118
00:09:23.452 --> 00:09:26.422
I'm the only doctor
within a 100 miles of here,


119
00:09:26.455 --> 00:09:30.192
and I don't recommend
doing surgery on yourself.


120
00:09:30.226 --> 00:09:33.362
I tried that once.
It didn't work out so well, I tell you.


121
00:09:33.395 --> 00:09:38.434
Anyway, my apologies,
my apologies. I...


122
00:09:38.467 --> 00:09:42.238
My pa says the only thing more important
than a man's gun is his humility.


123
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:46.275
Your pa's a smart man.
You should learn to follow him.


124
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.256
- What do I owe you, Doc?
- Owe me?


125
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.891
You don't owe me.

126
00:10:02.925 --> 00:10:05.294
You took out Ben Casey
and his sons.


127
00:10:05.327 --> 00:10:07.396
If anything, I owe you.

128
00:10:07.429 --> 00:10:11.267
[mutters]

129
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.537
Listen, I don't think
you should leave


130
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:17.006
until your head clears.

131
00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:18.841
[grunts]

132
00:10:18.874 --> 00:10:21.243
But, ah, hell, you're not gonna
heed me anyway, are you?


133
00:10:24.413 --> 00:10:25.481
Mister?

134
00:10:38.994 --> 00:10:41.897
If you get a moment, I'd just
like to run something by you.


135
00:10:42.598 --> 00:10:44.867
[Kansas grunting]

136
00:10:45.434 --> 00:10:47.069
Feeling okay?

137
00:10:47.102 --> 00:10:48.971
Look, look, I don't...
I don't mean to bother you,


138
00:10:49.004 --> 00:10:50.939
but just when-when...
when you're done,


139
00:10:50.973 --> 00:10:54.043
I wanted to talk to you
about something of mine.


140
00:10:54.076 --> 00:10:55.010
What do you want, kid?

141
00:10:55.044 --> 00:10:58.213
Uh, well, actually,
I got this book here.


142
00:10:58.247 --> 00:11:00.983
I think you might know it.
I mean, it's not... it's...


143
00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:02.851
it's not exactly my...
my kind of...


144
00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:05.387
- Oh, God.
- Kinda... kinda story,


145
00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:07.990
uh, but that's you there.

146
00:11:08.023 --> 00:11:10.826
- Help me on this horse.
- Okay.


147
00:11:12.194 --> 00:11:13.462
[grunting]

148
00:11:16.131 --> 00:11:18.400
You get up there all right?
Feels okay on there?


149
00:11:21.103 --> 00:11:24.340
- So-so I wanted to talk to you for a moment...
- I'll see you around, kid.


150
00:11:24.373 --> 00:11:27.976
[Billy] Hey, hey.
Did you hear what I said?


151
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.179
Sir, I just need
a second of your time.


152
00:11:31.947 --> 00:11:34.316
But... it's my Pa, he's got...

153
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.118
I know his type.

154
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:38.921
He's searching for something,
but he don't know what.


155
00:11:38.954 --> 00:11:42.191
And he won't stop
till he finds it.


156
00:11:42.224 --> 00:11:46.228
Lindstrom, the next time
you bring me a patient,


157
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:49.398
it'd be really nice if their
teeth needed fixing, too.


158
00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:51.900
Sure, Doc.

159
00:12:07.082 --> 00:12:08.350
[Billy] Hey, mister.

160
00:12:10.552 --> 00:12:13.389
Mister, I don't care
sour grapes about you, but...


161
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.226
Look, I'm broke
and I'm foot sore,


162
00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:18.460
and so you got to listen.

163
00:12:18.494 --> 00:12:20.462
[grunting]

164
00:12:25.067 --> 00:12:26.568
Oh, God.

165
00:12:33.743 --> 00:12:36.679
Look, we-we got us a ranch
down in Bell's Meadow,


166
00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:38.547
west of Texas,
off in the foothills,


167
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.084
and my Ma's been getting letters
from Canon City prison.


168
00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:44.386
Thorn Larson.

169
00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:47.690
Pa got real mad
and burned 'em up.


170
00:12:47.724 --> 00:12:50.092
I've never seen him that mad.

171
00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:52.428
Ma said he used to bother her
before she got married


172
00:12:52.461 --> 00:12:57.633
and Pa said you're the only one that can
maybe stop Larson when his time is up.


173
00:12:57.667 --> 00:13:02.037
But I just heard how Larson busted free
at Canon City, so we gotta warn Pa.


174
00:13:05.073 --> 00:13:07.109
What's your name?

175
00:13:07.142 --> 00:13:09.978
Cassidy. Billy Cassidy.

176
00:13:11.447 --> 00:13:13.348
What's your ma's name?

177
00:13:13.382 --> 00:13:16.285
Carol.
And my pa's name is Sam.


178
00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:19.555
You have any other kin?

179
00:13:19.588 --> 00:13:22.659
Well, my pa,
he had a brother, Jack.


180
00:13:22.692 --> 00:13:24.526
Seems he-he went off
to fight with Grant.


181
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.128
Got killed.

182
00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:28.497
So there's no Cassidy's
left except my pa.


183
00:13:29.465 --> 00:13:31.033
And-and my ma she's got a...

184
00:13:31.066 --> 00:13:33.535
she got friend over from...
from Texas, Leslie Allen,


185
00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:35.672
shoots better than I do, but...

186
00:13:35.705 --> 00:13:37.539
Look, are you gonna
help us or not?


187
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:42.077
Honest truth. You cheat?

188
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.613
Well, yeah.
But he cheated first, so I just...


189
00:13:44.646 --> 00:13:49.384
You damn cheat. God.

190
00:13:49.418 --> 00:13:52.221
Don't-don't tell my Pa.
He'd whoop me for sure.


191
00:13:54.056 --> 00:13:55.792
So you gonna help us or not?

192
00:13:55.825 --> 00:13:57.493
How far?

193
00:13:58.795 --> 00:14:00.362
Three days.

194
00:14:00.395 --> 00:14:02.364
Quit smiling, kid.

195
00:14:24.419 --> 00:14:27.189
Leslie, you're my best friend,
but if I didn't know better


196
00:14:27.222 --> 00:14:28.825
I'd think you were a boy.
[chuckles]


197
00:14:28.858 --> 00:14:32.394
The way you hold that gun.

198
00:14:32.427 --> 00:14:34.196
[woman]
Like the love of her life.


199
00:14:34.229 --> 00:14:35.597
How are you supposed to
find a husband


200
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:37.399
if you can outshoot
and outride them all?


201
00:14:37.432 --> 00:14:39.101
[woman]
Come on, now. Leave her be.


202
00:14:39.134 --> 00:14:42.304
One of us has to meet these men
on their own terms.


203
00:14:42.337 --> 00:14:46.308
Lord knows you and I just
run the house for our masters.


204
00:14:46.341 --> 00:14:49.779
After I married Sam,
and my father died


205
00:14:49.812 --> 00:14:51.413
my mother moved to Texas.

206
00:14:51.446 --> 00:14:54.283
And Leslie's mother
sent her along


207
00:14:54.316 --> 00:14:56.151
to get away from
some secret admirer.


208
00:14:56.719 --> 00:14:58.654
A long time ago.

209
00:14:58.688 --> 00:15:00.389
How old were you, 15?

210
00:15:00.422 --> 00:15:02.457
Sixteen.

211
00:15:02.491 --> 00:15:04.259
Sixteen.

212
00:15:04.293 --> 00:15:06.361
It changed her, though.

213
00:15:06.395 --> 00:15:08.196
Do you even own a dress?

214
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:11.768
Now what happened
to the secret admirer


215
00:15:11.801 --> 00:15:13.302
she was dragged away from?

216
00:15:13.335 --> 00:15:15.304
She will not tell.

217
00:15:24.847 --> 00:15:26.716
[tense music playing]

218
00:15:34.256 --> 00:15:35.257
Whoa, boys.

219
00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:38.126
This is my property.

220
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.796
Sam Cassidy?

221
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:41.163
That's me.

222
00:15:47.636 --> 00:15:49.204
Oh, my God.

223
00:15:49.237 --> 00:15:50.606
Ladies, get to the cellar now.

224
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:52.709
Now! Go! Get!

225
00:15:57.947 --> 00:15:59.716
[women screaming]

226
00:15:59.749 --> 00:16:01.249
Get outside!

227
00:16:02.517 --> 00:16:03.786
Get out!

228
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.895
[groaning]

229
00:16:19.802 --> 00:16:20.903
No.

230
00:16:46.528 --> 00:16:47.664
Thorn.

231
00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:54.369
Where's my husband?

232
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.806
You're looking at him.

233
00:16:59.341 --> 00:17:03.378
Looks like we're gonna have to
extract that tooth, Mr. Veal.


234
00:17:03.412 --> 00:17:05.882
Now, if you could just say "ah".

235
00:17:05.915 --> 00:17:07.582
Now this ain't gonna
hurt too much.


236
00:17:07.616 --> 00:17:10.820
I applied enough
numbing agent to your gums.


237
00:17:10.853 --> 00:17:13.588
You wouldn't feel a bullet
going through your jaw.


238
00:17:15.357 --> 00:17:16.558
Where is he?

239
00:17:16.591 --> 00:17:18.661
Excuse me?

240
00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:20.863
You talk to
a doctor like that?


241
00:17:20.897 --> 00:17:24.834
You know, you may be in need
of medical attention one day.


242
00:17:24.867 --> 00:17:28.938
I ain't got time for your games.
Where is he?


243
00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:30.740
Where is who?

244
00:17:30.773 --> 00:17:32.875
Kansas Red.

245
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:35.477
I know you treated the man
who killed my brother.


246
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.611
Now, where is he?

247
00:17:36.645 --> 00:17:39.682
I don't know no Kansas Red.

248
00:17:40.717 --> 00:17:42.384
You are lying, Doc.

249
00:17:42.417 --> 00:17:43.853
And I'll shoot you.

250
00:17:45.722 --> 00:17:48.858
Now, why don't you point
that sidearm another direction,


251
00:17:48.891 --> 00:17:52.394
then maybe we can sit down
and talk calmly about this.


252
00:17:52.427 --> 00:17:54.797
I'm losing time, Doc,
and so are you.


253
00:17:54.831 --> 00:17:55.932
Now, where'd he go?

254
00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:59.367
[sighs]
I don't know where he went.


255
00:17:59.401 --> 00:18:02.471
I will shoot you
in your backside.


256
00:18:02.504 --> 00:18:05.942
Why are you protecting him?
He ain't no kin of yours.


257
00:18:05.975 --> 00:18:10.913
I'm not protecting anybody.
Now you need to leave my office.


258
00:18:10.947 --> 00:18:14.016
I ain't leaving
until you tell me where he is.


259
00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.719
And I sincerely hope I don't
have to shoot you in the leg


260
00:18:16.753 --> 00:18:18.988
and get the truth
to leak out of you.


261
00:18:22.892 --> 00:18:24.292
[grunts]

262
00:18:39.776 --> 00:18:41.476
You really think
there's a posse coming?


263
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.712
I don't see anybody.

264
00:18:42.745 --> 00:18:45.413
But we need to make tracks,
just in case.


265
00:18:48.517 --> 00:18:49.952
Women gonna be trouble?

266
00:18:49.986 --> 00:18:51.486
Men are already
fighting over 'em.


267
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.654
Well, they can wait.

268
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.025
I want Ms. Cassidy
to settle down.


269
00:18:56.058 --> 00:18:57.727
And she's my woman, you know.

270
00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.596
Yeah. I like the young one.

271
00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:05.567
Ms. Cassidy sees or hears
one bad act,


272
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.936
I'll kill you.

273
00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:44.907
[coyote howling in distance]

274
00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:51.113
This frightens me.

275
00:19:53.783 --> 00:19:56.585
Don't be scared.
You're with me.


276
00:19:59.188 --> 00:20:00.388
You're different.

277
00:20:02.925 --> 00:20:08.363
All those years in prison,
and all because of Jack Cassidy.


278
00:20:09.866 --> 00:20:11.667
I'm gonna find him
one of these days,


279
00:20:11.701 --> 00:20:15.503
and I'm gonna make him pay
for ruining my life.


280
00:20:16.138 --> 00:20:18.440
Jack died in the war.

281
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.144
Damn.

282
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.048
All these years
I've been waiting.


283
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:28.918
And he cheated me.

284
00:20:50.639 --> 00:20:51.674
[gasps]

285
00:20:51.707 --> 00:20:53.976
Say a damn word,
I'll kill you.


286
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.712
- Understand?
- Mm-hmm.


287
00:20:56.746 --> 00:20:58.881
Alright. So come with me.

Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!

Well, you didn't care
when she ran off to Texas.

Why do you care now?

306
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:40.883
Charlie will find her.
She's on foot.


307
00:22:42.118 --> 00:22:43.886
We'll get out of these woods
before long,


308
00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:46.689
and we'll drop them off
at a trading post or something.

talking to each other anyway.

00:23:55.424 --> 00:23:59.594
but he's buried up
on the hill with his men.


320
00:24:01.397 --> 00:24:03.799
Folks has been taking turns

321
00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:07.236
looking after the place
till y'all got back.


322
00:24:09.305 --> 00:24:10.940
Wh... where's Ma?

323
00:24:13.309 --> 00:24:16.979
Well... she carried off...

324
00:24:18.414 --> 00:24:22.952
along with Leslie Allen
and Mrs. Walker.


325
00:24:22.985 --> 00:24:24.186
[sobbing]

326
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.056
They say outlaws took 'em.

327
00:24:27.089 --> 00:24:29.358
Fella by the name
of Thorn Larson.


328
00:24:29.391 --> 00:24:32.328
Whole bunch busted out
of Canon City.


329
00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:35.764
Sly Walker, you know,
he's in town at the doc's.


330
00:24:35.798 --> 00:24:37.399
Shot up somethin' awful.

331
00:24:38.968 --> 00:24:40.136
Even if he make it,

332
00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:41.871
he ain't gonna
ever be the same.


333
00:24:43.772 --> 00:24:46.342
Mr. Finnegan,
this is Kansas Red.


334
00:24:47.943 --> 00:24:49.278
Mr. Kansas.

335
00:24:53.315 --> 00:24:56.886
The name Finnegan.
Glad to know you.


336
00:24:56.919 --> 00:24:59.822
I prospected up there.
I know that land.


337
00:25:00.756 --> 00:25:02.191
I can track, too.

338
00:25:03.292 --> 00:25:04.326
Want me with you?

339
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.995
Can you keep up?

340
00:25:07.062 --> 00:25:08.898
There ain't no doubt.

341
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:10.766
[whimpering]

342
00:25:39.028 --> 00:25:41.463
[Kansas] I'm gonna search
the lower elevation.


343
00:25:41.497 --> 00:25:43.999
Make camp where I tie my horse.

344
00:26:08.524 --> 00:26:10.426
[panting]

345
00:27:07.082 --> 00:27:09.084
[panting]

346
00:27:16.191 --> 00:27:17.359
Who's there?

347
00:27:23.565 --> 00:27:24.566
Come on.

348
00:27:27.403 --> 00:27:28.837
Come on.

349
00:27:32.107 --> 00:27:33.275
[whispers]
What do I do?


350
00:27:43.485 --> 00:27:45.220
Come on out.

351
00:27:47.956 --> 00:27:49.058
Come on out!

352
00:27:54.163 --> 00:27:55.230
Come out now.

353
00:27:59.168 --> 00:28:00.903
- [gasps]
- Oh, miss.


354
00:28:03.605 --> 00:28:06.075
- It's okay. Hey, hey.
- No, no.


355
00:28:06.108 --> 00:28:07.543
I'm not gonna hurt you.

356
00:28:09.545 --> 00:28:11.580
Miss, you all right?

357
00:28:11.613 --> 00:28:12.614
Hey, hey, look at me.

358
00:28:12.648 --> 00:28:13.982
Come on now.

359
00:28:15.351 --> 00:28:16.652
Hey, come on.

360
00:28:16.686 --> 00:28:18.454
It's okay, hey.

361
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:20.622
I ain't gonna hurt you.

362
00:28:22.091 --> 00:28:23.359
You're cold. Come on.

363
00:28:25.127 --> 00:28:28.397
Come on. You can trust me.

364
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.498
Okay.

365
00:28:34.503 --> 00:28:37.940
Okay. Okay, I got you.
I got you. I got you.


366
00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:44.947
Okay, okay.

367
00:28:46.148 --> 00:28:47.383
I'll get you help.

368
00:28:48.317 --> 00:28:49.485
I'll get you help.

369
00:28:57.626 --> 00:28:59.495
[grunts]

370
00:28:59.528 --> 00:29:00.562
Billy.

371
00:29:01.296 --> 00:29:02.531
Ms. Leslie!

372
00:29:06.235 --> 00:29:08.137
Get her down now.

373
00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.006
Hold on.
Get her by the fire.


374
00:29:12.641 --> 00:29:14.977
Easy.

375
00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.512
- You got her?
- I got her.


376
00:29:19.682 --> 00:29:21.383
Billy, we got coffee on?

377
00:29:23.619 --> 00:29:25.087
Have a seat.

378
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:28.957
It'll be alright.

379
00:29:30.459 --> 00:29:31.927
[grunts]

380
00:29:34.229 --> 00:29:36.298
[sobbing]

381
00:29:37.132 --> 00:29:38.534
We didn't...

382
00:29:40.536 --> 00:29:41.671
My mother...

383
00:29:43.305 --> 00:29:45.240
Your mother's okay.

384
00:29:46.275 --> 00:29:47.744
She's okay.

385
00:29:47.777 --> 00:29:50.212
And so is Mrs. Walker.

386
00:29:52.381 --> 00:29:53.716
What about Sam?

387
00:29:54.416 --> 00:29:55.651
He's dead.

388
00:29:57.486 --> 00:29:59.488
All gone, except Walker.

389
00:30:00.622 --> 00:30:02.157
He's gonna be crippled.

390
00:30:03.459 --> 00:30:04.694
Here, Billy.

391
00:30:06.094 --> 00:30:07.162
Give her that.

392
00:30:07.196 --> 00:30:10.199
Uh, Ms. Leslie,
this is Kansas Red.


393
00:30:21.711 --> 00:30:24.980
Have I... do I know you
from somewhere?


394
00:30:26.716 --> 00:30:28.283
Not likely.

395
00:30:29.686 --> 00:30:31.987
You have any idea
where they went?


396
00:30:33.422 --> 00:30:36.693
West, somewhere west,
over the ridge.


397
00:30:36.726 --> 00:30:39.394
You say west over the ridge?

398
00:30:39.428 --> 00:30:42.464
You hear 'em talk about
anywhere in particular?


399
00:30:43.565 --> 00:30:46.235
Mule
-Mule Creek.

400
00:30:46.268 --> 00:30:50.372
Mule Creek? That's...
that's an old trading post.


401
00:30:50.405 --> 00:30:52.508
It's been abandoned years now.

402
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:54.677
Alright, Billy,

403
00:30:54.711 --> 00:30:56.578
you take her back.

404
00:30:56.612 --> 00:31:00.249
No, I am staying here.
I have earned my place.


405
00:31:01.583 --> 00:31:03.118
And Carol is my friend.

406
00:31:04.086 --> 00:31:06.421
What is it with you, huh?

407
00:31:06.455 --> 00:31:07.690
You have a death wish?

408
00:31:07.724 --> 00:31:10.526
She could just ride
the pack horse.


409
00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:14.429
And I'm not goin' back either, so we'll
just shorten stirrups on the saddle.


410
00:31:16.164 --> 00:31:17.332
You goin' back.

411
00:31:28.544 --> 00:31:31.146
He looks so familiar to me.

412
00:31:31.179 --> 00:31:34.249
You've probably seen his face
on them dime novels.


413
00:31:35.517 --> 00:31:36.819
Pa said he's the only one

414
00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:38.220
who could stop Larson.

415
00:31:38.253 --> 00:31:41.456
No one can get Larson.

416
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:44.560
He's the most vicious man
that I've ever seen.


417
00:31:48.463 --> 00:31:52.501
Let's just establish one thing
right now. I'm in charge.


418
00:31:52.534 --> 00:31:55.137
Billy, take her back.

419
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:58.106
I am not going anywhere.

420
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.176
You're not. Good luck.

421
00:32:19.294 --> 00:32:20.830
Larson's camp?

422
00:32:20.863 --> 00:32:23.465
Reckon they've been gone
since sometime this morning.


423
00:32:25.935 --> 00:32:27.870
Yeah, all the coals are out.

424
00:32:46.488 --> 00:32:47.724
Marianne's.

425
00:32:54.396 --> 00:32:55.865
[Kansas] All right,
look for hoof prints.


426
00:32:55.898 --> 00:32:57.667
See what direction
they were headed.


427
00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.736
They can't be that far
ahead of us.


428
00:33:04.807 --> 00:33:06.341
[sighs]

429
00:33:13.582 --> 00:33:15.183
[Leslie gasps]

430
00:33:15.217 --> 00:33:16.953
No. It's Marianne.

431
00:33:16.986 --> 00:33:18.888
- Don't. No.
- No. No.


432
00:33:18.921 --> 00:33:20.322
There ain't nothing
down here for you to see.


433
00:33:20.355 --> 00:33:22.925
No, no, no, no.
[crying]


434
00:33:30.332 --> 00:33:36.806
[Finnegan] Blessed are the pure
in heart for they shall see God.


435
00:33:36.839 --> 00:33:39.474
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

436
00:33:42.444 --> 00:33:43.612
[Leslie] No.

437
00:33:45.313 --> 00:33:46.783

Everybody find something
to get behind.


442
00:33:56.358 --> 00:33:57.827
I can't see anything.

443
00:34:00.863 --> 00:34:04.734
Leslie, stay down.
Billy, where are you?


444
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.672
Finnegan, to your right!

[grunts]

452
00:34:50.713 --> 00:34:55.317
Let's get back. Regroup.
Get back, Billy.


453
00:34:55.952 --> 00:34:57.385
Is everyone okay?

454
00:34:58.921 --> 00:35:00.288
[Leslie] Yeah.

455
00:35:03.525 --> 00:35:05.527
[Kansas] Finnegan,
can you get the horses?


456
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.329
We got to stay on their trail.

457
00:35:29.852 --> 00:35:30.920
Whoa.

458
00:35:33.823 --> 00:35:35.457

Finnegan.


462
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.091
You know him?

463
00:36:09.125 --> 00:36:12.627
I know him.
It's the Grossman brothers.


464
00:36:14.496 --> 00:36:16.631
Tom here had a wife
and two kids.


465

[Kansas whispers]
Let's check this.


466
00:37:09.785 --> 00:37:11.854
[Kansas] We're just gonna
stay here tonight.


467
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:27.069
Wow.

Oh, my God.

- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

- What's your name?
- Mavery.


474
00:37:48.758 --> 00:37:52.460
My name is Leslie.
Are you here alone?

- You are?

Oh, it's okay.

Oh. Oh, my gosh.

[Finnegan]
Mavery, Birdie!

00:38:19.789 --> 00:38:21.991
It's so good to see y'all.
How you doing?


484
00:38:22.024 --> 00:38:24.860
Hi, bud. Hi.

485
00:38:26.228 --> 00:38:30.733
You guys.
Okay, there you go.


486
00:38:30.766 --> 00:38:32.868
[Finnegan]
Ain't you a sight for sore eyes?


487
00:38:33.836 --> 00:38:35.771
You know where your ma is?

488
00:38:38.307 --> 00:38:39.976
Well, that settles that.

489
00:38:40.009 --> 00:38:41.944
You stay here with the kids

490
00:38:41.978 --> 00:38:44.714
until the stagecoach comes.

491
00:38:44.747 --> 00:38:47.183
No, no.
I'm going to find my friend.


492
00:38:47.216 --> 00:38:49.218
[sighs]

493
00:38:49.251 --> 00:38:51.586
[Finnegan chuckles] Don't worry about
it, Ms. Leslie.


494
00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:53.655
I'll stay here
with the children.


495
00:38:53.689 --> 00:38:55.758
A couple more days
the stage will come through.


496
00:38:55.791 --> 00:38:58.227
Now, if memory serves,
I could draw you a map


497
00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.627
of where they might be going.

498
00:38:59.662 --> 00:39:01.263
The direction they were going,

499
00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:05.801
I figured they might be heading
toward a place called Chance.


500
00:39:05.835 --> 00:39:10.706
Now, it's kind of
an outlaw hideout. Ain't no law.


501
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.241
Ain't really much
of a town either.


502
00:39:12.274 --> 00:39:14.043
They might get there
to rest up a couple days,


503
00:39:14.076 --> 00:39:17.079
- and find a stage or a bank.
- Mm, yeah, okay.


504
00:39:17.113 --> 00:39:18.948
- [Finnegan] See you.
- Thank you.


505
00:39:18.981 --> 00:39:21.649
Right now these children
need to get some shuteye.


506
00:39:21.684 --> 00:39:22.718
Mm.

507
00:39:31.894 --> 00:39:33.095
[grunts]

508
00:39:36.966 --> 00:39:39.769
- [gasping]
- Say a damn word, I'll kill you.


509
00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:43.839
[mutters]

510
00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:49.678
No. [sobbing]

511
00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.717
No. No.

512
00:39:59.755 --> 00:40:01.623
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
- No.


513
00:40:01.656 --> 00:40:02.892
Hey.

514
00:40:02.925 --> 00:40:04.193
[gasps]

515
00:40:04.226 --> 00:40:06.929
It's just me. Are you okay?

516
00:40:06.962 --> 00:40:09.865
It's-it's just a terrible dream.

517
00:40:09.899 --> 00:40:12.101
I have them a lot.

518
00:40:12.134 --> 00:40:15.671
Well, I'm sure they'll stop
once we find your friend.


519
00:40:15.704 --> 00:40:18.340
No, they won't.

520
00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:21.811
[sniffles]

521
00:40:22.845 --> 00:40:24.146
No.

522
00:40:27.416 --> 00:40:30.585
They won't stop until
I tell somebody about them.


523
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.590
Please?

524
00:40:36.025 --> 00:40:37.359
[sighs]

525
00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:42.597
I love Carol like a sister.

526
00:40:45.968 --> 00:40:49.305
But... when we were in Kansas,

527
00:40:49.338 --> 00:40:52.875
her mother was determined
to get her to marry Sam.


528
00:40:53.776 --> 00:40:55.744
He had a-a job.

529
00:40:55.778 --> 00:40:59.782
He did well for himself in town.
His father was a preacher.


530
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:04.253
But Carol didn't care for Sam.

531
00:41:05.721 --> 00:41:09.992
And I
-I was a lot younger.

532
00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:13.362
All of 16.

533
00:41:15.831 --> 00:41:17.900
Fully grown.
[chuckles]


534
00:41:20.302 --> 00:41:22.838
And crazy in love with Sam.

535
00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.243
And he felt
the same way about me.


536
00:41:27.276 --> 00:41:31.013
And then, all of a sudden,

537
00:41:31.046 --> 00:41:33.749
he was running off,
marrying Carol.


538
00:41:36.218 --> 00:41:37.953
She was so beautiful.

539
00:41:37.987 --> 00:41:40.723
She could have had
anyone she wanted.


540
00:41:40.756 --> 00:41:44.160
But Sam had the money.

541
00:41:44.193 --> 00:41:45.161
I felt like...

542
00:41:47.129 --> 00:41:49.431
I felt like Sam had betrayed me.

543
00:41:53.402 --> 00:41:55.738
[sniffles]
Oh.


544
00:41:55.771 --> 00:41:59.341
Then when I went back to the...
to the ranch to visit Carol...


545
00:42:01.844 --> 00:42:06.382
he acted like he didn't even recognize
me, like I was a stranger.


546
00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:11.153
And I didn't feel that love
like I remembered,


547
00:42:11.187 --> 00:42:13.355
but it still hurt.

548
00:42:14.857 --> 00:42:19.161
Now Sam's dead
and Carol's missing.


549
00:42:19.195 --> 00:42:24.300
And I feel worse
than I ever, ever could. Just...


550
00:42:27.803 --> 00:42:33.342
Just resentments,
and I just feel so bad.


551
00:42:33.375 --> 00:42:36.345
And I-I just wanna
find Carol now.


552
00:42:40.216 --> 00:42:42.718
The one thing
I don't understand...


553
00:42:44.353 --> 00:42:47.056
is where does Larson
fit into all this?


554
00:42:48.557 --> 00:42:53.128
All I know is that Larson

555
00:42:53.162 --> 00:42:55.231
has been in love with Carol,

556
00:42:55.264 --> 00:42:57.733
before she ever married Sam.

557
00:42:58.567 --> 00:43:00.970
And she'd always flirt with him.

558
00:43:02.371 --> 00:43:06.842
I've seen him a few times
but he scares me.


559
00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:11.880
And his men...
his men are just as bad.


560
00:43:11.914 --> 00:43:17.086
Thatch, that man, ooh,
he was a... he was a paymaster.


561
00:43:20.155 --> 00:43:22.024
Larson killed a lot of men.

562
00:43:23.225 --> 00:43:24.960
A lot of men.

563
00:43:24.994 --> 00:43:28.264
I think in that bank robbery.

564
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:34.069
Thank you.

565
00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:36.972
I feel like I can...

566
00:43:37.006 --> 00:43:39.041
I feel like
I can go to sleep now.


567
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:41.343
[sighs]

568
00:43:43.345 --> 00:43:45.114
We're gonna find your friend.

569
00:43:48.617 --> 00:43:49.918
Okay.

570
00:44:01.363 --> 00:44:02.798
[sniffles]

571
00:44:09.338 --> 00:44:10.472
[sniffles]

572
00:44:29.158 --> 00:44:31.593
You take good care
of your sister, okay.


573
00:44:32.394 --> 00:44:33.395
Hm?

574
00:44:37.299 --> 00:44:38.834
Be careful out there.

575
00:44:42.438 --> 00:44:43.906
[child crying]

576
00:44:46.175 --> 00:44:47.343
Look after 'em, now.

577
00:44:53.582 --> 00:44:55.217
Mr. Finnegan.

578
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:56.352
Billy.

579
00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.855
Don't go doing nothin' stupid.

580
00:45:13.035 --> 00:45:15.070
[tense music playing]

581
00:45:46.068 --> 00:45:47.503
Have we
really lost them?


582
00:45:48.537 --> 00:45:50.639
Well, they got
a lot of money.


583
00:45:50.673 --> 00:45:53.175
Bet they've been wantin'
to spend it.


584
00:45:53.208 --> 00:45:55.310
Wha... Around here?

585
00:45:55.344 --> 00:45:57.646
Right over that ridge
is Chase County.


586
00:46:00.149 --> 00:46:05.120
Hey, uh, why don't y'all
head back, you and Billy?


587
00:46:05.154 --> 00:46:07.724
I'll go out alone.
You'll get recognized.


588
00:46:07.757 --> 00:46:11.694
What about you? Your face
is all over those dime novels.


589
00:46:11.728 --> 00:46:14.329
It don't matter.

590
00:46:14.363 --> 00:46:16.298
What about Larson?
You don't know what he looks like.


591
00:46:16.331 --> 00:46:18.133
You don't even know
what Carol looks like.


592
00:46:20.035 --> 00:46:21.336
Where'd you get that?

593
00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:24.973
On the ranch.
Stay back.


594
00:46:34.751 --> 00:46:37.085
[horse approaching]

595
00:46:52.568 --> 00:46:55.370
Mister, I'm looking for
a Thorn Larson.


596
00:46:55.404 --> 00:46:58.240
Him and his wife
left this morning.


597
00:46:58.273 --> 00:47:03.345
He had about a dozen or so
mean-looking hombres with him.


598
00:47:03.378 --> 00:47:07.182
Mean, mm-hmm, as hell.

599
00:47:08.317 --> 00:47:10.352
They didn't
cause no trouble though,


600
00:47:10.385 --> 00:47:14.256
they just bought up supplies
and had a drink.


601
00:47:14.289 --> 00:47:16.659
Two of 'em
still at the saloon.


602
00:47:20.496 --> 00:47:21.563
Hey, mister.

603
00:47:25.601 --> 00:47:29.071
If they ain't friends of yours,
I'd head on out of here.


604
00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:39.581
That army payroll paid us off pretty good.
Old Thorn...


605
00:47:39.615 --> 00:47:41.483
Keep us in this for a while.

606
00:47:44.119 --> 00:47:46.221
[indistinct chatter]

607
00:48:08.577 --> 00:48:11.580
I don't believe this is the
kind of bar you want to be in.


608
00:48:35.872 --> 00:48:38.440
Don't you turn
your back on me.


609
00:48:49.585 --> 00:48:52.254
[grunting]

610
00:48:56.158 --> 00:48:58.160
- [Kansas] Where's Larson?!
- Go to hell!


611
00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:02.665
[man]
Come on, boys. Get him inside.


612
00:49:12.709 --> 00:49:14.711
[grunts]

613
00:49:14.744 --> 00:49:16.578
I'm Sam Gridley.

614
00:49:18.614 --> 00:49:19.749
Kansas.

615
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:25.153
Kansas Red.
You the preacher man.


616
00:49:25.187 --> 00:49:28.891
Want to say something over
those two boys you just shot?


617
00:49:28.925 --> 00:49:31.259
No. Wherever they are,
they're already there.


618
00:49:32.628 --> 00:49:34.931
I have to find Larson.

619
00:49:34.964 --> 00:49:39.167
Well, all we know
is he headed west.


620
00:49:39.201 --> 00:49:43.438
That's open country out there.
He could have turned anywhere.


621
00:49:43.472 --> 00:49:45.808
There's a paymaster that was...

622
00:49:45.842 --> 00:49:49.578
that was robbed on another stage
road just up the ridge east of here.


623
00:49:49.611 --> 00:49:52.414
Well, if they've got
a lot of money,


624
00:49:52.447 --> 00:49:54.917
about the only other place
they could spend it around here


625
00:49:54.951 --> 00:49:56.719
would be Gold Hollow.

626
00:49:56.753 --> 00:50:00.790
There's about half a dozen
saloons up there.


627
00:50:01.824 --> 00:50:03.826
Heap of comings and goings.

628
00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:05.962
They could blend right in.

629
00:50:05.995 --> 00:50:09.531
It's about 40 miles due west.

630
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:18.540
I know your face.
I know your face from somewhere.


631
00:50:18.573 --> 00:50:21.610
I can't...
I never forget a-a face.


632
00:50:21.643 --> 00:50:23.378
Forget a name.

633
00:50:23.412 --> 00:50:25.682
Where'd you say
you're from again?


634
00:50:26.749 --> 00:50:28.383
I didn't.

635
00:50:36.693 --> 00:50:37.960
Why don't you like me?

636
00:50:39.394 --> 00:50:40.529
What did I do?

637
00:50:40.562 --> 00:50:42.597
What is wrong with you?

638
00:50:43.298 --> 00:50:44.867
Ah, dames.

639
00:50:49.972 --> 00:50:51.440
Hey, get...

640
00:50:51.473 --> 00:50:52.675
[Leslie grunts]

641
00:51:02.651 --> 00:51:04.586
Let's get one thing straight...

642
00:51:06.588 --> 00:51:08.490
I'm still in charge.

643
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.260
[grunts]

644
00:51:43.558 --> 00:51:45.027
[exhales]

645
00:51:45.061 --> 00:51:46.461
[grunts]

646
00:51:50.066 --> 00:51:51.366
[groans]

647
00:52:47.556 --> 00:52:48.858
Yeah, this will work.

648
00:52:50.092 --> 00:52:51.694
All right, listen up.

649
00:52:51.727 --> 00:52:54.396
You get hungry, bring the food
up to your room, okay.


650
00:52:54.429 --> 00:52:58.668
Don't leave the room.
I'm pretty sure Larson's around.


651
00:52:59.434 --> 00:53:00.703
I'm in charge.

652
00:53:00.736 --> 00:53:02.504
Stay in the room.

653
00:53:05.507 --> 00:53:06.641
I'm not...

654
00:53:22.792 --> 00:53:23.993
[whispers] Come on.

655
00:53:29.598 --> 00:53:32.034
- Hide...
- He don't know nothing about it.


656
00:53:32.068 --> 00:53:33.703
Just keep your head down.

657
00:53:56.558 --> 00:53:58.761
Pal, if you're
looking for the sheriff...


658
00:54:01.697 --> 00:54:03.733
he ain't here.

659
00:54:03.766 --> 00:54:05.701
He done gone off
to Lake City.


660
00:54:06.235 --> 00:54:07.469
Vacation.

661
00:54:07.502 --> 00:54:10.039
I heard Thorn Larson's
in town.


662
00:54:11.674 --> 00:54:12.942
Sure as hell hope not.

663
00:54:12.975 --> 00:54:16.012
Well, there's his
wanted poster right there.


664
00:54:16.045 --> 00:54:19.916
Ho, ho, ho, ho. What is you?

665
00:54:19.949 --> 00:54:21.516
Some sort of bounty hunter?

666
00:54:21.549 --> 00:54:23.652
Kansas Red.

667
00:54:23.686 --> 00:54:25.520
No shit?

668
00:54:25.553 --> 00:54:27.223
You got one of those
telegraph machines?


669
00:54:27.256 --> 00:54:28.556
Sure do.

670
00:54:29.591 --> 00:54:31.761
But it's been down for weeks.

671
00:54:31.794 --> 00:54:34.462
We caught wind of Larson
escaping and that was that.


672
00:54:38.134 --> 00:54:41.804
He broke out
and rampaged the ranch


673
00:54:41.837 --> 00:54:43.773
down in Tyler, and, well,
he took three women.


674
00:54:43.806 --> 00:54:45.540
One's dead.

675
00:54:46.709 --> 00:54:48.543
One got away, and well,

676
00:54:49.211 --> 00:54:51.479
I hear tell,

677
00:54:51.513 --> 00:54:53.149
that he forced one
to marry him.


678
00:54:54.616 --> 00:54:56.052
Didn't hear nothin' about that.

679
00:54:56.085 --> 00:54:58.120
But we got a whole bunch
of people coming and going here,


680
00:54:58.154 --> 00:54:59.587
'cause of the mines.

681
00:55:00.622 --> 00:55:03.125
He'd be real hard to find.

682
00:55:03.159 --> 00:55:05.194
And he's gonna
have a lot of money.


683
00:55:06.662 --> 00:55:08.664
Knocked out the relay station,

684
00:55:08.698 --> 00:55:11.533
an army surplus,
and four dead troopers.


685
00:55:12.268 --> 00:55:14.036
Payroll?

686
00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:16.038
Didn't hear nothin'
about that neither.


687
00:55:16.072 --> 00:55:17.472
Hmm.

688
00:55:19.208 --> 00:55:20.475
Walk with me.

689
00:55:21.844 --> 00:55:24.046
He's got maybe a dozen men.

690
00:55:25.881 --> 00:55:27.683
And we got a loaded bank.

691
00:55:27.717 --> 00:55:30.552
Now, he could be anywhere.

692
00:55:30.585 --> 00:55:33.089
Now, this Larson,
he know you on sight?


693
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:36.558
Not likely,
it was before the war.


694
00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:38.961
But you know him on sight?

695
00:55:38.995 --> 00:55:41.897
Oh, yeah.
He stands out in a crowd.


696
00:55:41.931 --> 00:55:43.065
He's a tall one.

697
00:55:44.632 --> 00:55:46.068
[Billy] The more time
that we're out here,


698
00:55:46.102 --> 00:55:47.535
the more chances there are
that Kansas...


699
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:49.672
- Billy, can you just...
- But also there...


700
00:55:49.705 --> 00:55:51.573
You need to relax, Billy.

701
00:55:53.608 --> 00:55:56.078
- What's wrong with your gun?
- My gun was taken from me.


702
00:55:56.112 --> 00:55:58.546
- I just don't think that...
- Oh, my God. That's Thatch.


703
00:56:01.851 --> 00:56:04.153
That's him.
That's Thatch.


704
00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.229
- Kansas.
- Kansas.


705
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:16.165
We can't let him get away.

706
00:56:16.198 --> 00:56:20.302
Kansas. Kansas! Kansas!

707
00:56:20.336 --> 00:56:21.636
We just saw one of 'em.

708
00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:23.939
The one that hurt Ms. Leslie.

709
00:56:23.973 --> 00:56:25.207
He just rode out.

710
00:56:25.241 --> 00:56:27.542
What are you two doing out?

711
00:56:29.311 --> 00:56:33.315
Kansas, the way that man looked at Ms.
Leslie, he's coming back.


712
00:56:36.318 --> 00:56:40.622
I'ma stay here...
to watch out for ambushes.


713
00:56:40.655 --> 00:56:42.058
I'ma get up a posse.

714
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:52.701
Unless you two wanna die...

715
00:56:55.204 --> 00:56:58.674
stay in your hotel! Okay?

716
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:16.926
[crickets chirping]

717
00:57:29.805 --> 00:57:30.840
[door creaking]

718
00:57:32.341 --> 00:57:34.276
[tense music playing]

719
00:57:51.894 --> 00:57:54.130
- [yelps]
- Miss me, girl? Do you miss me?


720
00:57:54.163 --> 00:57:55.664
- No! No!
- You miss me?


721
00:57:56.765 --> 00:57:58.701
- No!
- You miss me?


722
00:58:00.736 --> 00:58:02.872
[grunting]
You miss me, girl?


723
00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.709
[muttering]

724
00:58:07.843 --> 00:58:10.045
No! No!

725
00:58:15.718 --> 00:58:17.652
- Come on!
- [yells]


726
00:58:29.365 --> 00:58:30.432
[Leslie gasps]

727
00:58:31.767 --> 00:58:33.169
[grunting]

728
00:58:39.241 --> 00:58:41.177
Billy!

729
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:43.846
Ms. Leslie? Ms. Leslie!

730
00:58:43.879 --> 00:58:45.214
[Leslie yelps]

731
00:58:58.294 --> 00:58:59.695
[Kansas] Harms!

732
00:59:00.763 --> 00:59:02.331
Yeah, I can't sleep either.

733
00:59:03.532 --> 00:59:06.268
That Thatch fellow
done return.


734
00:59:06.302 --> 00:59:08.437
Put a knife
to the night clerk's neck.


735
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:12.208
- Leslie.
- Snagged the key then slit his throat.


736
00:59:15.177 --> 00:59:16.912
You okay?

737
00:59:16.946 --> 00:59:20.282
And this one, Thatch done
started getting frisky,


738
00:59:20.316 --> 00:59:22.051
she blew him right away.

739
00:59:24.954 --> 00:59:26.922
Ah, dang it.

740
00:59:26.956 --> 00:59:28.857
Sick and tired of this.

741
00:59:30.059 --> 00:59:31.927
You all right?

742
00:59:31.961 --> 00:59:37.233
Listen, that stagecoach is gonna
be outside tomorrow morning.


743
00:59:37.266 --> 00:59:39.768
And I want you on it.

744
00:59:39.802 --> 00:59:41.737
And, Billy,
you're going with her.


745
00:59:42.871 --> 00:59:44.440
What about Carol?

746
00:59:44.473 --> 00:59:46.442
[Harms] Carol ain't here.

747
00:59:46.475 --> 00:59:48.477
Yup.
They done robbed a bank, too.


748
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:51.213
Left the owner half for dead.

749
00:59:51.247 --> 00:59:54.250
Shit. I better
get up another posse.


750
00:59:54.283 --> 00:59:57.253
I'm going with the posse.

751
00:59:57.286 --> 00:59:59.888
We're leaving 15 to 20.

752
00:59:59.922 --> 01:00:03.859
Billy, I need you
to go with Ms. Leslie.


753
01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:07.963
I'm gonna find my mother
with or without you.


754
01:00:07.997 --> 01:00:11.033
Damn it, Billy.
This isn't up for discussion.


755
01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:13.335
You've got no right
to order me around.


756
01:00:13.369 --> 01:00:15.170
I've got every right.

757
01:00:16.405 --> 01:00:21.844
Kid...
I'm your father's brother.


758
01:00:22.945 --> 01:00:26.849
No, Uncle Jack
died in the war.


759
01:00:27.983 --> 01:00:29.018
No...

760
01:00:34.156 --> 01:00:35.391
I'm Jack.

761
01:00:36.892 --> 01:00:38.027
No.

762
01:00:42.197 --> 01:00:43.999
No.

763
01:00:44.033 --> 01:00:45.501
I told you things.

764
01:00:45.534 --> 01:00:50.172
Really personal things
I would have never told you.


765
01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.274
No.

766
01:00:53.876 --> 01:00:54.910
No.

767
01:00:56.345 --> 01:00:58.547
Pa teared up
when he talked about


768
01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.551
how sweet Jack was,
how innocent Jack was.


769
01:01:02.584 --> 01:01:06.989
And you, you are a crotchety,
miserable old...


770
01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.930
See, you can't be him.

771
01:01:23.339 --> 01:01:26.608
There's a stagecoach
outside tomorrow morning.


772
01:01:33.582 --> 01:01:35.050
Be on it.

773
01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.386
Uncle Jack.

774
01:02:18.661 --> 01:02:21.196
I suppose I can rethink
the whole


775
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:25.534
you being dead thing
if I have to.


776
01:02:26.535 --> 01:02:29.204
Well, kid, there's...

777
01:02:30.472 --> 01:02:32.474
there's more than
one way of being dead.


778
01:02:34.009 --> 01:02:37.246
Not no more.
I'm ridin' with you.


779
01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.248
No you're not.

780
01:02:39.281 --> 01:02:41.283
You're staying back with Leslie.

781
01:02:42.518 --> 01:02:46.955
We're kin.
Kin ride together.


782
01:02:46.989 --> 01:02:49.958
[Harms]
Let's go, boys. Come on.


783
01:02:49.992 --> 01:02:51.560
There goes the posse.

784
01:02:53.529 --> 01:02:55.097
Hell bent to the leather.

785
01:02:56.131 --> 01:02:57.700
What time are we leaving?

786
01:03:02.137 --> 01:03:03.338
Daybreak.

787
01:03:12.514 --> 01:03:14.016
You all packed up, Billy?

788
01:03:15.017 --> 01:03:16.018
About.

789
01:03:23.158 --> 01:03:24.626
What the hell happened?

790
01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:28.597
We ran into an ambush.

791
01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:36.605
They popped out of some rocks,
along side a creek.


792
01:03:37.573 --> 01:03:40.075
We got some of 'em. but...

793
01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:42.544
I reckon, what,
seven of 'em got away?


794
01:03:42.578 --> 01:03:43.645
[man] That's right, Deputy.

795
01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.616
- Did you see my mother?
- Hell, I don't know, kid.


796
01:03:47.649 --> 01:03:49.551
We'll get your ma, Billy.

797
01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.325
We've all come this far
together, I'm riding with you.


798
01:03:56.358 --> 01:04:00.229
Like hell you are.
It's too dangerous.


799
01:04:00.262 --> 01:04:02.598
You need me.
I'm a good shot.


800
01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:04.066
No, you're not.

801
01:04:04.099 --> 01:04:07.603
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.


802
01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:11.106
Alright, then.
I'll tell you what, Jasper,


803
01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:14.476
why don't you round up the boys,
let the horses head back home.


804
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:18.547
Chalk this up to a loss.
My horse is pretty tuckered out.


805
01:04:20.817 --> 01:04:24.586
He'll make it to Letterman Ranch
about 20 miles west of here.


806
01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.588
The same way y'all are headed.

807
01:04:26.622 --> 01:04:29.591
Logan made it that far,
ain't that right?


808
01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:34.496
That is, if you don't
mind me tagging along.


809
01:04:36.098 --> 01:04:37.366
Happy to have you.

810
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.743
Billy, get up.
Let's go.


811
01:04:59.454 --> 01:05:01.290
[tense music playing]

812
01:05:22.712 --> 01:05:24.212
What do you think, Harms?

813
01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:29.451
Right there's Letterman Ranch.

814
01:05:32.755 --> 01:05:35.157
We got to corral four horses.

815
01:05:36.625 --> 01:05:38.493
Stockpile four guns.

816
01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.229
Thorn and Thatch no doubt.

817
01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.902
What-what are you
waiting on, Kansas?


818
01:05:45.935 --> 01:05:47.770
I wanna make a plan, Billy.

819
01:05:47.804 --> 01:05:50.339
Ma is right there.

820
01:05:50.372 --> 01:05:52.207
Well, I ain't gettin' shot
for you again.


821
01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.542
We ain't got no more time.

822
01:05:53.575 --> 01:05:55.277
Keep your voice down.

823
01:05:55.310 --> 01:05:57.747
What the hell's the matter with you?
Trying out us?


824
01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:00.148
If you're not going with me,
I'm going by myself.


825
01:06:00.182 --> 01:06:02.785
There's certain things in life
you're gonna learn the hard way.


826
01:06:02.819 --> 01:06:04.553
This ain't one of 'em.

827
01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:06.154
If you're not going,
I'm going by myself.


828
01:06:06.188 --> 01:06:07.356
- [Kansas] Billy...
- All right.


829
01:06:07.389 --> 01:06:08.725
- Billy, Billy!
- Billy!


830
01:06:08.758 --> 01:06:11.293
[groans] I'll go chaperone him.

831
01:06:12.494 --> 01:06:14.429
[grunts] Billy.

832
01:06:20.369 --> 01:06:21.603
[grunts]

833
01:06:44.426 --> 01:06:46.796
I remember when you were
just a skinny little kid.


834
01:06:48.831 --> 01:06:50.800
[soft chuckle]

835
01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:54.603
Just bashful. So quiet.

836
01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:56.939
And so young
when you went off to war.


837
01:06:59.676 --> 01:07:04.346
Yeah, and I remember you
a skirt of a girl.


838
01:07:04.379 --> 01:07:06.548
Chasing after Sam.

839
01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:07.582
Mm.

840
01:07:08.951 --> 01:07:11.253
I wish I never told you
about me and Sam.


841
01:07:11.286 --> 01:07:12.287
Hm.

842
01:07:12.855 --> 01:07:14.691
Sam loved you.

843
01:07:14.724 --> 01:07:15.758
He did.

844
01:07:17.626 --> 01:07:19.494
But he loved Carol.

845
01:07:20.797 --> 01:07:22.597
That's why he didn't go to war.

846
01:07:24.433 --> 01:07:27.770
But then you joined up. Why?

847
01:07:29.872 --> 01:07:32.441
What turned you
into a gunfighter?


848
01:07:32.474 --> 01:07:34.543
Well...
[clears throat]


849
01:07:35.845 --> 01:07:38.748
Probably talking to
women like yourself.


850
01:07:41.884 --> 01:07:43.686
How are they doing?

851
01:07:45.822 --> 01:07:47.924
They can't stay out
in the cold.


852
01:07:47.957 --> 01:07:49.926
Think we're gonna have to...
garden?


853
01:07:57.066 --> 01:07:58.533
Nah, we'll be fine.

854
01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:05.540
[grunting]

855
01:08:10.947 --> 01:08:12.347
[Harms] Come on, Billy.

856
01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:29.932
[coughing]

857
01:08:29.966 --> 01:08:31.734
Like that, Billy.

858
01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:39.675
Help me get his jacket
up of him.


859
01:08:41.376 --> 01:08:42.444
Why?

860
01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.615
They'll think I'm one of 'em.

861
01:08:46.648 --> 01:08:47.950
And they'll figure
the other's still on guard,


862
01:08:47.984 --> 01:08:49.384
so you can't come.

863
01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:51.087
Sounds risky.

864
01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.756
I got to see
if my ma's in there.


865
01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:54.991
All right.

866
01:09:12.675 --> 01:09:15.745
Now go on.
I'll cover you from here.


867
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:27.422
Go on.

868
01:09:33.095 --> 01:09:34.797
Sense of urgency, Billy.

869
01:09:53.615 --> 01:09:55.383
Thorn?

870
01:09:55.417 --> 01:09:56.853
[Thorn] I'm in here, darling.

871
01:10:05.027 --> 01:10:06.561
Look what I found.

872
01:10:06.595 --> 01:10:07.830
[Thorn] Oh, let's see.

873
01:10:08.865 --> 01:10:10.166
Feathers.

874
01:10:10.199 --> 01:10:11.868
- Yeah.
- I love it.


875
01:10:11.901 --> 01:10:13.368
Feathers.

876
01:10:14.937 --> 01:10:16.839
Yeah. Pretty.

877
01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.842
Like you. Come here.

878
01:10:19.876 --> 01:10:22.044
[tense music playing]

879
01:10:45.134 --> 01:10:46.669
Well?

880
01:10:46.702 --> 01:10:48.503
There were just two of 'em
standing watch,


881
01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:49.805
and we got 'em both.

882
01:10:49.839 --> 01:10:52.875
If we go now,
we can finish this.


883
01:10:57.947 --> 01:11:02.685
If this thing goes south...
you gotta get help.


884
01:11:06.889 --> 01:11:08.824
You be careful, Jack Cassidy.

885
01:11:38.888 --> 01:11:40.990
[tense music playing]

886
01:12:02.912 --> 01:12:04.680
[grunting]

887
01:12:06.816 --> 01:12:08.951
What's going on?
What's going on over here?


888
01:12:08.985 --> 01:12:10.820
[grunting]

889
01:12:17.827 --> 01:12:20.196
[whispering]
Billy. Billy! Billy!


890
01:12:26.335 --> 01:12:28.270
Don't you touch my mother!

891
01:12:28.304 --> 01:12:30.538
- [Carol] Billy!
- I don't know you.


892
01:12:30.572 --> 01:12:33.909
Explain yourself before I put
a bullet in your head.


893
01:12:33.943 --> 01:12:35.144
Thorn, no.

894
01:12:40.349 --> 01:12:42.184
He's your son.

895
01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:46.621
What?

896
01:12:47.757 --> 01:12:49.125
That's my kid?

897
01:12:51.761 --> 01:12:53.763
Damn fine-looking boy.

898
01:12:55.264 --> 01:12:56.265
Why didn't you
tell me, Carol?


899
01:12:56.298 --> 01:12:59.168
Well, you were in jail
when I first found out.


900
01:13:00.602 --> 01:13:01.704
My mother arranged for me

901
01:13:01.737 --> 01:13:03.305
to marry Sam Cassidy
right away.


902
01:13:05.341 --> 01:13:06.909
I didn't have a choice.

903
01:13:16.252 --> 01:13:18.120
Holster your pistol, Larson.

904
01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:23.658
Well, this just keeps
getting better and better.


905
01:13:27.863 --> 01:13:29.698
I thought you was dead.

906
01:13:30.699 --> 01:13:31.834
Not yet.

907
01:13:38.007 --> 01:13:39.775
Don't you know
who this is, Carol?


908
01:13:39.809 --> 01:13:43.012
- That's Kansas Red. That's who.
- It's all right, Billy.


909
01:13:43.045 --> 01:13:46.048
That's Jack Cassidy.
I'd know them eyes anywhere.


910
01:13:46.982 --> 01:13:48.717
Jack's dead.

911
01:13:48.751 --> 01:13:51.821
You're gonna pay
for putting me in prison.


912
01:13:51.854 --> 01:13:53.722
That was just petty thefts
all that was.


913
01:13:53.756 --> 01:13:55.124
Petty theft and a dead man.

914
01:13:55.157 --> 01:13:58.260
Can we...
can we put this behind us?


915
01:13:58.294 --> 01:13:59.995
Get out of the way,
Carol.


916
01:14:00.963 --> 01:14:02.364
It's been years.

917
01:14:05.101 --> 01:14:09.738
We're together now.
We have our son.


918
01:14:09.772 --> 01:14:11.774
He is no father of mine.

919
01:14:11.807 --> 01:14:15.244
Attaboy.
Got sand. I like that.


920
01:14:15.277 --> 01:14:18.080
Get along just fine, me and you.

921
01:14:19.815 --> 01:14:22.084
And to answer your question,
Carol, no.


922
01:14:23.452 --> 01:14:24.954
I can't put it behind me.

923
01:14:24.987 --> 01:14:27.156
- [Carol gasps]
- [grunts]


924
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:28.757
Thorn.

925
01:14:29.725 --> 01:14:31.961
[groaning]

926
01:14:31.994 --> 01:14:33.129
Thorn, no!

927
01:14:33.162 --> 01:14:35.865
No, no.

928
01:14:37.166 --> 01:14:38.434
Thorn, no.

929
01:14:38.467 --> 01:14:40.369
[Kansas] Billy. Billy.

930
01:14:40.402 --> 01:14:41.971
[Leslie]
Carol, thank God!


931
01:14:45.407 --> 01:14:46.842
[sobbing]

932
01:14:50.146 --> 01:14:51.213
[Kansas] Billy.

933
01:14:52.982 --> 01:14:54.316
You alright?

934
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:56.986
You just shot
the only man I ever loved.


935
01:14:58.787 --> 01:15:01.290
Then why didn't you marry him
instead of Pa?


936
01:15:02.191 --> 01:15:04.160
Because Thorn was in jail.

937
01:15:04.193 --> 01:15:07.663
And I was with child,
and Sam had the money to take care of us.


938
01:15:08.397 --> 01:15:09.832
From where?

939
01:15:09.865 --> 01:15:13.002
The bank robbery?
Or the payroll?


940
01:15:14.403 --> 01:15:16.972
All those dead men,
and Marianne,


941
01:15:17.006 --> 01:15:18.908
and-and a woman
from the relay station?


942
01:15:18.941 --> 01:15:21.210
We found them
on the side of a trail, dead.


943
01:15:21.243 --> 01:15:24.013
Marianne ran away,
just like you did.


944
01:15:25.314 --> 01:15:27.816
She just couldn't survive
on her own.


945
01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:30.719
Really?
Is that what you think, Carol?


946
01:15:30.753 --> 01:15:33.956
And what about the people that live here?
Where are they?


947
01:15:33.989 --> 01:15:36.258
I don't know, Leslie.

948
01:15:36.292 --> 01:15:38.794
How could you
do this to Pa?


949
01:15:40.429 --> 01:15:42.998
He wasn't your father.

950
01:15:43.032 --> 01:15:47.870
Living with Sam was like
living with a cold stove.


951
01:15:47.903 --> 01:15:50.873
Everything he ever did
he did for you.


952
01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.415
Everybody who's dead is dead.

953
01:16:01.183 --> 01:16:02.918
Well, the others
must have done that,


954
01:16:02.952 --> 01:16:05.187
because Thorn wouldn't have
killed those people.


955
01:16:06.422 --> 01:16:08.357
Where have you been
all these years?


956
01:16:16.899 --> 01:16:18.968
All those years.

957
01:16:35.818 --> 01:16:37.019
[door opens]

958
01:16:38.954 --> 01:16:40.155
[door closes]

959
01:17:03.912 --> 01:17:05.147
[sighs]

960
01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:06.415
God.

961
01:17:14.123 --> 01:17:15.958
Here, come here.

962
01:17:19.395 --> 01:17:21.096
Is it bad?

963
01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:23.198
Yeah.

964
01:17:23.232 --> 01:17:25.000
I've really got
to quit gettin' shot.


965
01:17:25.034 --> 01:17:27.202
[chuckles] Yes, you do.

966
01:17:29.238 --> 01:17:30.439
Ooh.

967
01:17:35.177 --> 01:17:38.180
Mm, we've both wasted
a lot of years.


968
01:17:39.248 --> 01:17:40.983
Yeah, we have.

969
01:17:45.888 --> 01:17:47.823
We both need to start over.

970
01:17:57.933 --> 01:17:59.635
- [Billy] Kansas, we need you!
- No. No, no, no.


971
01:17:59.669 --> 01:18:01.937
[Billy]
The horses knocked over a fence!


972
01:18:02.338 --> 01:18:03.339
[groans]

973
01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.576
Yeah, it's never too late
to start.


974
01:18:08.644 --> 01:18:10.479
[grunts]

975
01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.235
Thorn was gonna be
my whole life.


976
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:35.938
Now he's gone.

977
01:18:40.242 --> 01:18:44.146
Gonna sell the ranch,
live in San Francisco.


978
01:18:44.179 --> 01:18:46.850
Maybe I'll meet someone
that can give me what I want.


979
01:18:49.551 --> 01:18:52.154
How sad Jack must have been
all these years.


980
01:18:53.522 --> 01:18:56.492
Going off to the war,
becoming so notorious.


981
01:18:57.626 --> 01:18:59.428
I really must have
broken his heart.


982
01:19:02.732 --> 01:19:05.300
And now he's off to Montana
with Billy.


983
01:19:09.571 --> 01:19:12.408
I'm sorry you have to wait
for the southbound coach.


984
01:19:13.743 --> 01:19:17.379
Texas is gonna seem
so tame to you now.


985
01:19:17.413 --> 01:19:21.917
Carol, do you know why
Mother brought me to Texas?


986
01:19:24.553 --> 01:19:27.089
Because I was in love with Sam.

987
01:19:30.259 --> 01:19:32.961
But she wanted you to have him.

988
01:19:32.995 --> 01:19:34.930
And now I see why.

989
01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:41.336
I ju... I just wish
I hadn't resented her.


990
01:19:41.370 --> 01:19:42.705
It doesn't matter now.

991
01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:50.112
All I want now is Montana.

992
01:19:52.047 --> 01:19:53.716
So, wish me luck.

993
01:20:07.496 --> 01:20:08.964
Ma.

994
01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:19.608
Safe travels, Ma.

995
01:20:22.311 --> 01:20:23.579
You too, son.

996
01:20:36.726 --> 01:20:38.994
Oh, oh.

997
01:20:40.062 --> 01:20:41.096
Sneaky, sneaky.

998
01:20:41.129 --> 01:20:42.498
So that's where it's been.

999
01:20:44.233 --> 01:20:48.136
Uh, you and me
got some talking to do.


1000
01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:50.606
It's my money.
Thorn gave it to me.


1001
01:20:50.639 --> 01:20:56.211
It's not your money.
This here is stolen money.


1002
01:20:56.245 --> 01:20:57.714
All I have is my ticket.

1003
01:20:57.747 --> 01:20:59.615
I can't even pay for
a hotel room.


1004
01:20:59.648 --> 01:21:00.616
What would you have me do?

1005
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:03.252
This here is a good portion
of the reward.


1006
01:21:05.087 --> 01:21:06.756
The rest of this is goin' back.

1007
01:21:11.393 --> 01:21:15.430
Now, listen, why don't you
head on out to San Francisco?


1008
01:21:16.431 --> 01:21:18.333
You write the sheriff,

1009
01:21:18.367 --> 01:21:20.269
we'll help you sell the ranch.

1010
01:21:29.846 --> 01:21:35.150
Now, Ms. Carol... you've been
through too much as it is.


1011
01:21:36.485 --> 01:21:37.653
Safe travels.

1012
01:21:57.774 --> 01:22:00.777
Well, what now?

1013
01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:02.845
It appears this is
the end of the line for us.


1014
01:22:04.179 --> 01:22:05.380
Thank you.

1015
01:22:06.281 --> 01:22:07.449
Till next time.

1016
01:22:09.384 --> 01:22:10.753
Thank you, Deputy.

1017
01:22:10.787 --> 01:22:14.156
You're a good kid.
You'll be all right.


1018
01:22:16.391 --> 01:22:18.427
Well, then. So long.

1019
01:22:36.946 --> 01:22:39.548
You're a sorry-looking pair.

1020
01:22:39.581 --> 01:22:41.851
Ms. Leslie,
why are you going to Texas?


1021
01:22:41.884 --> 01:22:44.219
You can go
to Montana with us.


1022
01:22:44.252 --> 01:22:46.789
I'm gonna buy a ranch
and raise horses.


1023
01:22:46.823 --> 01:22:48.725
Billy, I don't know
about that now.


1024
01:22:48.758 --> 01:22:51.326
She hasn't done anything else
we've asked her to.


1025
01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.195
That ain't gonna change.

1026
01:22:53.228 --> 01:22:56.198
She can cook pretty good.
She rides like a man.


1027
01:22:56.231 --> 01:22:57.900
She hits everything
she aims at.


1028
01:22:59.836 --> 01:23:01.704
I don't want you to go.

1029
01:23:01.738 --> 01:23:03.706
Billy...

1030
01:23:07.744 --> 01:23:12.514
You know, I-I've had
four lives now, and, uh...


1031
01:23:13.783 --> 01:23:15.785
Well, one in Kansas.

1032
01:23:15.818 --> 01:23:21.456
Um, one in a war
that will haunt me forever.


1033
01:23:23.726 --> 01:23:24.861
[stutters]

1034
01:23:24.894 --> 01:23:27.964
One wandering years and...

1035
01:23:27.997 --> 01:23:29.364
Well, I...

1036
01:23:31.768 --> 01:23:33.770
I got a chance
to start over now.


1037
01:23:35.504 --> 01:23:39.942
I guess what, um,
what I'm trying to say...


1038
01:23:39.976 --> 01:23:43.311
it just... it just wouldn't be
the same without you.


1039
01:23:48.885 --> 01:23:50.318
[sighs]

1040
01:23:51.954 --> 01:23:53.388
I...

1041
01:23:56.291 --> 01:23:58.728
Would you look at me
for a second?


1042
01:23:58.761 --> 01:23:59.829
Just...

1043
01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:08.437
I-I-I'd buy you
that new model Winchester.


1044
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:13.241
And, uh, I'd shine it up
real nice, and..


1045
01:24:14.609 --> 01:24:17.412
And I'd carve-carve
your name in it.


1046
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:22.350
Um...

1047
01:24:22.384 --> 01:24:24.954
Oh... [clears throat]

1048
01:24:34.463 --> 01:24:35.765
If you marry me.

1049
01:24:39.434 --> 01:24:40.770
And a piano?

1050
01:24:41.838 --> 01:24:43.238
[chuckles]

1051
01:24:44.073 --> 01:24:45.942
And a wood stove
with an oven?


1052
01:24:45.975 --> 01:24:47.242
Yeah.

1053
01:24:49.644 --> 01:24:51.246
And lots of children?

1054
01:24:52.514 --> 01:24:53.582
Ten.

1055
01:24:53.615 --> 01:24:55.617
- [Leslie chuckles]
- Ten.


1056
01:25:03.893 --> 01:25:05.962
Yes. [chuckles]

1057
01:25:05.995 --> 01:25:08.965
Yes. Yes.

1058
01:25:18.406 --> 01:25:20.743
[both laughing]

1059
01:25:20.777 --> 01:25:24.747
She said yes, Billy.
We're going to Montana.


1060
01:25:25.647 --> 01:25:26.716
I'm still the boss.

1061
01:25:27.717 --> 01:25:29.651
- Yes, you are.
- Yes.


1062
01:25:29.685 --> 01:25:31.286
[laughing]

1063
01:25:52.574 --> 01:25:55.610
[Kansas] Hey, there's just one
stop I need to make on the way.


1064
01:26:00.615 --> 01:26:02.919
[grunting]

1065
01:26:12.028 --> 01:26:13.595
Oh. Oh, God.

1066
01:26:16.732 --> 01:26:21.570
Well, if it ain't
the infamous Kansas Red.


1067
01:26:21.603 --> 01:26:24.707
You know, I almost lost my life
on account of you?


1068
01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.608
Yeah, how's that?

1069
01:26:27.977 --> 01:26:31.013
Well, after you killed
Ben Casey and his boys,


1070
01:26:31.047 --> 01:26:34.150
his brother Slim
showed up looking for ya.


1071
01:26:34.183 --> 01:26:36.351
Well, where's he at now?

1072
01:26:37.954 --> 01:26:41.023
Either heaven or hell.
Ain't for me to say.


1073
01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:43.558
Did you put him there?

1074
01:26:43.592 --> 01:26:46.361
I didn't have any other choice.

1075
01:26:49.598 --> 01:26:52.735
Well, I hope it wasn't too much
of an inconvenience, Doc.


1076
01:26:52.768 --> 01:26:53.803
[chuckles]

1077
01:26:54.603 --> 01:26:55.604
Thank you.

1078
01:26:57.505 --> 01:26:58.708
Well, what can I do for you?

1079
01:26:58.741 --> 01:27:02.477
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna need
a few more stitches.


1080
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:07.683
Oh, my God. How many times
have you been shot, son?


1081
01:27:07.717 --> 01:27:11.787
- Well, I lost count. I don't...
- Uh-huh.


1082
01:27:11.821 --> 01:27:14.656
Well, you must have done
something good in your life.


1083
01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:16.859
Otherwise you wouldn't have had
so many chances.


1084
01:27:16.893 --> 01:27:20.495
Well, guess I'll find out
when I get there.


1085
01:27:20.528 --> 01:27:21.764
What do you say, Doc?

1086
01:27:21.797 --> 01:27:23.933
All right, come on,
I'll sew you up.


1087
01:27:24.934 --> 01:27:26.969
[grunts]

1088
01:27:27.003 --> 01:27:28.804
You don't want to go
by infection.


1089
01:27:28.838 --> 01:27:30.639
That's a bad way to go.

1090
01:27:30.673 --> 01:27:33.642
[grunts]
Maybe a few ribs there, too.


1091
01:27:33.676 --> 01:27:36.112
[doctor] Oh, for God sakes.

1092
01:27:47.898 --> 01:27:52.898
