CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION

2
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.585
Fuck.

3
00:01:33.668 --> 00:01:35.918
He said NT$500, but there's only NT$300.

4
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:36.918
Who are you with?

5
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.210
I'm with Boss Black from Wanhua.

6
00:01:39.293 --> 00:01:40.502
Understood.

7
00:01:41.043 --> 00:01:42.335
Sorry about that.

8
00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:44.835
Boss Hung always had a good reputation.

9
00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:47.877
Today is his funeral,
so of course it has to be grand.


10
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.127
If your boss kicks the bucket,
we'll also go to Taipei to show support.


11
00:01:53.543 --> 00:01:55.252
Please help us out.

12
00:01:58.377 --> 00:01:59.543
Who are you with?

13
00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:01.335
Boss Black from Wanhua.

14
00:02:01.502 --> 00:02:03.210
Apologies.

15
00:02:03.377 --> 00:02:04.377
Appreciate it.

16
00:02:04.793 --> 00:02:05.793
Appreciate it.

17
00:02:14.502 --> 00:02:17.085
We have pork chop and soy-stewed pork.

18
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.252
They are both really good.

19
00:02:30.168 --> 00:02:32.210
You're with Boss Black too?

20
00:02:36.502 --> 00:02:38.252
How many people came today?

21
00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:40.377
If not a thousand, at least 800.

22
00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:47.627
Haven't been to such a big event
in a while.


23
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.752
Boss Hung sure loved extravagance.

24
00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:53.752
That lunatic really came up from Taipei
to whack him.


25
00:02:54.627 --> 00:02:55.627
Who?

26
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.627
They call him the "Kuilin Kid".

27
00:03:01.127 --> 00:03:02.668
Kuilin Kid?

28
00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:03.668
I'm telling you.

29
00:03:03.752 --> 00:03:06.668
He might be a lunatic,
but I think he's pretty awesome.


30
00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:11.043
You know him?

31
00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:14.710
The Kuilin Kid

32
00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:17.752
is a young gun from the streets
of Zhongshan District.


33
00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:19.168
Two months ago,

34
00:03:19.752 --> 00:03:22.877
Brother Nine won
NT$8 million at Boss Hung's casino.


35
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.252
Boss Hung wouldn't pay up,

36
00:03:24.335 --> 00:03:27.127
so Brother Nine told Kuilin Kid
to go collect the debt.


37
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.918
You know what happened?

38
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:30.043
What happened?

39
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.293
Turns out, Kuilin Kid brought a grenade.

40
00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:36.918
A grenade!

41
00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:40.168
Once he got there
and collected the NT$8 million,


42
00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:41.918
he blew up the casino.

43
00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:45.752
Killed Boss Hung. 
Isn't he cool?

44
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.710
- Cool.
- Right?


45
00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:56.002
But he may have
shot himself in the foot.

46
00:03:56.585 --> 00:03:59.085
Now that Ironhead has issued a kill order,

47
00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:03.293
it looks like the odds
are against Kuilin Kid.


48
00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:11.293
Hi, grandma.

49
00:04:11.377 --> 00:04:12.377
What is it?

50
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.418
Did you get the money I sent you?

51
00:04:15.668 --> 00:04:18.377
It's not too much. 
Just a few grand.

52
00:04:23.127 --> 00:04:24.043
Okay.

53
00:04:24.127 --> 00:04:25.752
I will be away for a while.

54
00:04:26.543 --> 00:04:28.127
Going overseas for work.

55
00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:31.960
- Remember to eat.
- Ironhead is here!


56
00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:34.877
I'll talk to you later.

57
00:04:36.502 --> 00:04:38.918
Ironhead!

58
00:04:40.043 --> 00:04:41.335
Ironhead is here.

59
00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:42.877
My name is Goldie.

60
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.585
Let's go back to Taipei together.

61
00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:46.002
I'm Chen Kui-lin.

62
00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:47.293
I have a real name.

63
00:04:47.377 --> 00:04:49.002
Stop calling me Kuilin Kid.

64
00:06:22.502 --> 00:06:23.752
- Go.
- Okay.


65
00:06:52.168 --> 00:06:53.668
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.


66
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.418
FOUR YEARS LATER

67
00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:39.293
Okay…

68
00:12:39.627 --> 00:12:41.585
I'll be over shortly. Okay.

69
00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:50.710
How much time left?

70
00:12:51.335 --> 00:12:53.168
Half a year at most.

71
00:12:53.252 --> 00:12:55.918
Worst case scenario, three months.

72
00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:00.293
Will Iressa or Tarceva help?

73
00:13:00.377 --> 00:13:02.210
It's too late.

74
00:13:04.335 --> 00:13:06.418
What about the new drug, Giotrif?

75
00:13:06.502 --> 00:13:08.210
Does your hospital have that?

76
00:13:08.293 --> 00:13:10.585
Look at this lung. 
It's all white.

77
00:13:12.043 --> 00:13:13.752
It's probably too late.

78
00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:16.043
Lung transplant?

79
00:13:18.543 --> 00:13:19.585
Kuei-ching.

80
00:13:20.502 --> 00:13:21.710
You're a doctor too.

81
00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:25.585
You should know what the situation is.

82
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.877
<i>Your grandma is in trouble.
Get here quickly.</i>


83
00:14:01.252 --> 00:14:03.210
Ms. Chang, what took you so long?

84
00:14:03.293 --> 00:14:05.335
The doctor's been waiting for you.

85
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.085
What's your relationship to the patient?

86
00:14:10.168 --> 00:14:11.918
I'm her doctor.

87
00:14:12.502 --> 00:14:13.918
You're her doctor?

88
00:14:14.002 --> 00:14:18.127
She has an 18cm tumor inside her ovary.
Did you know that?


89
00:14:18.793 --> 00:14:20.418
She just had a CT scan.

90
00:14:20.502 --> 00:14:22.502
Her abdominal cavity is severely bloated.

91
00:14:22.585 --> 00:14:24.377
She needs surgery right now.

92
00:14:24.543 --> 00:14:26.252
I need a signed consent form.

93
00:14:27.043 --> 00:14:29.043
The nursing home won't do it.

94
00:14:29.127 --> 00:14:32.043
You're the only contact
we could to get in touch with.


95
00:14:32.127 --> 00:14:33.585
So please sign the form.

96
00:14:34.668 --> 00:14:36.543
Or does she have other relatives?

97
00:14:40.543 --> 00:14:42.002
Make a decision now.

98
00:14:42.085 --> 00:14:44.585
If her life is in danger during surgery,

99
00:14:44.668 --> 00:14:45.960
do we resuscitate?

100
00:14:48.877 --> 00:14:50.293
Do we intubate?

101
00:14:52.502 --> 00:14:54.627
We'll follow regular surgery procedures.

102
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.043
If necessary, we will resuscitate.

103
00:14:57.127 --> 00:14:58.502
No intubation.

104
00:15:01.127 --> 00:15:02.418
Doctor.

105
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.168
Please, no intubation.

106
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.460
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

107
00:15:15.252 --> 00:15:17.377
What are the chances of success?

108
00:15:26.877 --> 00:15:30.002
Do you want her surgery to be successful?

109
00:15:36.543 --> 00:15:39.752
If it is, will you be able
to take care of her?


110
00:15:41.502 --> 00:15:43.835
After a few days in hospital,

111
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.543
she still has to
return to the nursing home.


112
00:16:05.918 --> 00:16:06.918
You finished school?

113
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.085
Mommy is still working.

114
00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:10.835
You eat with Daddy first.

115
00:16:40.627 --> 00:16:42.043
How did it go?

116
00:16:58.335 --> 00:17:00.793
<i>The accident was between
a truck full of eggs</i>


117
00:17:00.877 --> 00:17:02.627
<i>and a cash transport vehicle.</i>

118
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.168
<i>After the collision,
eggs covered the ground</i>


119
00:17:05.252 --> 00:17:07.335
<i>as NT$1,000 bills scattered everywhere.</i>

120
00:17:07.418 --> 00:17:11.127
<i>Police are urging residents
who took the bills to return them</i>


121
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.710
<i>to their nearest police station
as soon as possible,</i>


122
00:17:13.793 --> 00:17:16.127
<i>emphasizing that keeping the cash</i>

123
00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:18.835
<i>constitutes misappropriation
of lost property.</i>


124
00:17:18.918 --> 00:17:22.293
<i>Residents are advised to
turn themselves in and not test the law.</i>


125
00:17:22.377 --> 00:17:24.210
<i>- According to reporters…</i>
- The money


126
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:28.293
you told me to give Grandma over the years
has never been used.


127
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.710
Except for this watch
she bought last birthday.


128
00:17:33.793 --> 00:17:35.085
NT$300.

129
00:17:41.043 --> 00:17:43.377
I can't believe the
last time I saw her

130
00:17:45.043 --> 00:17:46.377
was four years ago.

131
00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:53.043
How long do you plan to
keep running and hiding?


132
00:17:54.252 --> 00:17:56.210
I had been really worried.

133
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.543
Worried that seeing news of my capture

134
00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.960
would break Grandma's heart.

135
00:18:12.502 --> 00:18:14.293
But now that she's gone,

136
00:18:18.585 --> 00:18:20.460
I'm going to do something big,

137
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.168
so every criminal in the underworld
will know who I am.


138
00:18:25.543 --> 00:18:29.252
There's something
I'm not sure if I should tell you now.


139
00:18:31.668 --> 00:18:33.293
The report is out.

140
00:18:37.627 --> 00:18:39.668
You need to be mentally prepared.

141
00:18:40.752 --> 00:18:42.710
What does that mean?

142
00:18:42.835 --> 00:18:44.377
Stage 4.

143
00:18:45.418 --> 00:18:46.918
Lung cancer.

144
00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.752
Terminal.

145
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.793
Are you sure?

146
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:02.252
Any treatments?

147
00:19:07.335 --> 00:19:09.085
Lung transplant?

148
00:19:09.168 --> 00:19:10.752
It's too late.

149
00:19:16.502 --> 00:19:18.168
How long do I have?

150
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.377
Six months at most.

151
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.627
Worst case scenario, three months.

152
00:19:25.043 --> 00:19:26.252
Stop smoking.

153
00:19:27.502 --> 00:19:29.627
What difference does it make?

154
00:19:33.043 --> 00:19:34.627
Don't you know?

155
00:19:36.043 --> 00:19:38.668
Lung cancer gets very agonizing
towards the end.


156
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.252
Rather than dying like a street rat,
you could act more honorably.


157
00:19:47.043 --> 00:19:48.918
Do what's right.

158
00:19:49.002 --> 00:19:51.085
At least die with a little dignity.

159
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.793
You want me to turn myself in?

160
00:20:06.085 --> 00:20:08.502
Go find me another lung.

161
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.502
Excuse me, Ms. Chang.

162
00:21:47.502 --> 00:21:48.585
What do you want?

163
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.877
Granny Hou from Lucky Nursing Home
passed away today.


164
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.543
Did you know her?

165
00:21:55.377 --> 00:21:57.293
Who are you?

166
00:21:58.877 --> 00:22:00.835
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION

167
00:22:03.168 --> 00:22:04.377
She had a grandson,

168
00:22:04.918 --> 00:22:06.335
Chen Kui-lin.

169
00:22:08.043 --> 00:22:09.585
Do you know him?

170
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.543
Never heard of him.

171
00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:17.418
Never heard of him?

172
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.252
You were in her contact book.

173
00:22:22.335 --> 00:22:24.002
What's your relationship with her?

174
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.293
I'm just a pharmacist.

175
00:22:27.127 --> 00:22:29.543
I sometimes deliver medicine
to nursing homes


176
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.960
and check the residents' health
while I'm there.


177
00:22:34.127 --> 00:22:36.335
Anyone could have my number.

178
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.668
Let me know if
you hear from Chen Kui-lin.

179
00:22:51.668 --> 00:22:54.752
CAPTAIN CHEN HUI

180
00:23:04.252 --> 00:23:06.377
Dear Holy Emperor Guan.

181
00:23:07.793 --> 00:23:10.002
This is your worshipper Chen Kui-lin.

182
00:23:12.002 --> 00:23:15.460
If Emperor Guan
would like me to surrender,


183
00:23:18.502 --> 00:23:20.002
please give me a sign.

184
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.127
Put the money in
and get your ID ready.

185
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.627
Won't be long.

186
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:30.960
Get everything ready.

187
00:24:31.043 --> 00:24:33.335
- Lots of people today.
- Put them in the bag.


188
00:24:34.668 --> 00:24:35.585
Sir.

189
00:24:35.668 --> 00:24:37.127
Please don't block the door.

190
00:24:39.293 --> 00:24:40.418
Sir.

191
00:24:44.377 --> 00:24:45.835
I'm Chen Kui-lin.

192
00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:47.960
Mr. Chen.

193
00:24:48.043 --> 00:24:51.460
If you're turning yourself in,
get your ID ready and go over there.


194
00:24:51.543 --> 00:24:53.293
I'm turning myself in.

195
00:24:53.377 --> 00:24:55.002
You and everyone else.

196
00:24:55.085 --> 00:24:56.377
There are procedures.

197
00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.710
Don't block the door.

198
00:24:57.793 --> 00:24:58.793
Follow instructions.

199
00:24:58.835 --> 00:25:00.252
Go over there. Hurry.

200
00:25:00.335 --> 00:25:01.335
Go line up.

201
00:25:01.377 --> 00:25:03.502
- Get your ID ready.
- Go this way.


202
00:25:05.085 --> 00:25:06.960
Everyone, this way.

203
00:25:11.043 --> 00:25:13.543
Easy. We're all in a hurry.

204
00:25:13.627 --> 00:25:16.210
Quickly get in line.

205
00:25:23.793 --> 00:25:26.752
THREE MOST WANTED FUGITIVES

NO. 3 CHEN KUI
-LIN

209
00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.085
Don't run. Slow down.

210
00:26:20.168 --> 00:26:21.835
Yu-yu.

211
00:26:23.085 --> 00:26:25.668
They were just saying they didn't see you.

212
00:26:25.877 --> 00:26:27.335
- But you're here.
- Yu-yu's mom.


213
00:26:27.418 --> 00:26:28.335
Give me the ball.

214
00:26:28.418 --> 00:26:29.585
Come…

215
00:26:29.668 --> 00:26:31.168
He says he's hungry.

216
00:26:31.252 --> 00:26:33.835
- We have sandwiches here.
- Here.


217
00:26:37.085 --> 00:26:39.168
- I bought lots.
- It's okay, I'll go buy one.


218
00:26:39.502 --> 00:26:40.502
I'll go buy one.

219
00:26:55.043 --> 00:26:56.335
What do you want?

220
00:27:02.918 --> 00:27:04.210
It's nice to have a family.

221
00:27:06.793 --> 00:27:08.418
How old is your son?

222
00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:10.252
Tell me what you want.

223
00:27:11.377 --> 00:27:12.877
Do you know Hongkie?

224
00:27:13.918 --> 00:27:15.293
What Hongkie?

225
00:27:16.877 --> 00:27:18.710
Operation Fox Hunt over 20 years ago.

226
00:27:18.835 --> 00:27:21.793
Standoff with police
at Xinyi's Wuxing St. apartments.


227
00:27:21.877 --> 00:27:25.085
I heard Xinyi Police Department
used up all their ammo.


228
00:27:25.168 --> 00:27:26.793
He was shot multiple times.

229
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.543
You must have helped him.

230
00:27:31.627 --> 00:27:32.877
What are you doing?

231
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.002
Where is he?

232
00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:35.960
I need to speak to him.

233
00:27:38.835 --> 00:27:42.335
Do you know why you can stand here
and talk to me right now?


234
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.710
If I were a snitch,
you'd already be in prison.


235
00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:53.210
Must be a good drink.

236
00:27:55.543 --> 00:27:57.085
Give it a try.

237
00:28:01.918 --> 00:28:04.002
There's a miracle doctor in Tainan.

238
00:28:04.085 --> 00:28:06.335
I'll take you to see him tomorrow.

239
00:28:17.502 --> 00:28:19.418
I'm not afraid of death.

240
00:28:21.127 --> 00:28:23.877
I'm afraid of being forgotten after death.

241
00:28:30.418 --> 00:28:32.002
Can you do me a favor tomorrow?

242
00:28:45.043 --> 00:28:46.543
What did you do?

243
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.960
What did you do to my son?

244
00:28:50.043 --> 00:28:52.585
The other day,
I passed the police station.


245
00:28:52.668 --> 00:28:54.543
I suddenly remembered what you said.

246
00:28:55.585 --> 00:28:57.668
Rather than living like a rat,

247
00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.960
I should turn myself in with dignity.

248
00:29:02.043 --> 00:29:03.418
So I went.

249
00:29:05.168 --> 00:29:07.293
But it was then that I realized

250
00:29:08.627 --> 00:29:11.043
I'm not even qualified to turn myself in.

251
00:29:12.877 --> 00:29:15.335
Turns out I don't have enough value yet.

252
00:29:23.877 --> 00:29:25.418
This is my value.

253
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.877
You know the story of Zhou Chu
and the Three Scourges?


254
00:29:35.127 --> 00:29:36.918
People only remember Zhou Chu,

255
00:29:38.168 --> 00:29:41.418
but never the
two other monsters Zhou Chu killed.


256
00:29:43.502 --> 00:29:46.377
That's why only Zhou Chu has value,

257
00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.377
and why people remember him.

258
00:30:02.793 --> 00:30:05.168
I'm a dying man.

259
00:30:08.793 --> 00:30:11.252
Help me one last time.

260
00:30:12.502 --> 00:30:13.877
Where is he?

261
00:30:19.043 --> 00:30:21.210
<i>The first time I met Hongkie</i>

262
00:30:22.168 --> 00:30:24.793
<i>was over 20 years ago.</i>

263
00:30:26.335 --> 00:30:29.293
<i>It was the day
of the Wuxing St. shootout.</i>

264
00:30:29.377 --> 00:30:32.835
<i>At 10:00 p.m.,
a few underlings carried him in,</i>


265
00:30:32.918 --> 00:30:34.710
<i>asking me to save him.</i>

266
00:30:34.793 --> 00:30:37.710
<i>One bullet was lodged in his head.</i>

267
00:30:38.752 --> 00:30:41.752
<i>I didn't have
any surgery equipment with me.</i>


268
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.418
<i>I wouldn't dare operate even if I did.</i>

269
00:30:46.293 --> 00:30:50.252
That bullet
is still stuck in Hongkie's head.


270
00:30:52.085 --> 00:30:54.502
He has headaches almost every day.

271
00:30:55.335 --> 00:30:57.835
I can only prescribe him some painkillers,

272
00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.793
which someone fetches for him every month.

273
00:31:01.377 --> 00:31:03.585
Who fetches his medicine?

274
00:31:04.127 --> 00:31:05.127
Okay.

275
00:31:06.585 --> 00:31:07.793
Okay, I understand.

276
00:31:13.793 --> 00:31:15.293
<i>For about 10 years now,</i>

277
00:31:15.377 --> 00:31:18.668
<i>a girl named Hsiao-mei
has been getting his medicine.</i>


278
00:31:20.002 --> 00:31:22.127
<i>She was only a teenager back then.</i>

279
00:31:23.085 --> 00:31:25.502
<i>I know nothing about her background.</i>

280
00:31:27.627 --> 00:31:28.960
Her name is Hsiao-mei?

281
00:31:31.002 --> 00:31:32.460
Cheng Hsiao-mei.

282
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.710
Cheng Hsiao-mei.

283
00:31:38.293 --> 00:31:39.710
Let me take a photo.

284
00:31:39.793 --> 00:31:42.710
One, two, three, yeah.

285
00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.168
Your son sure loves ice cream.

286
00:31:51.252 --> 00:31:53.210
It's not good for his teeth.

287
00:31:55.502 --> 00:31:58.710
You kidnapped him
and you're worried about his teeth?


288
00:31:59.793 --> 00:32:00.918
Where's Lin Lu-ho?

289
00:32:01.877 --> 00:32:04.085
He disappeared a long time ago.

290
00:32:07.502 --> 00:32:11.043
Over a decade ago,
he sent a letter from here to his mom.


291
00:32:12.668 --> 00:32:14.293
This is her reply.

292
00:32:16.002 --> 00:32:18.627
KAOHSIUNG ELDERLY CARE CENTER
YANG SHU-CHEN


293
00:32:27.752 --> 00:32:29.710
I've told you everything I know.

294
00:32:29.793 --> 00:32:31.460
Where's my son?

295
00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.710
I'll tell you once I see Cheng Hsiao-mei.

296
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.835
<i>Mom!</i>

297
00:33:32.502 --> 00:33:35.127
Mom, it's so heavy!

298
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:37.002
Are you hurt? Let me take a look.

299
00:33:37.793 --> 00:33:39.168
No.

300
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.043
Would you like a room?

301
00:34:37.127 --> 00:34:38.335
Any vacancies?

302
00:34:39.127 --> 00:34:40.418
NT$850 a night.

303
00:35:29.335 --> 00:35:32.627
Don't get it from Rat Ming next time.

304
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:36.293
But his stuff is so cheap.

305
00:35:36.377 --> 00:35:39.043
- What happened to your hand?
- Nothing.


306
00:35:39.752 --> 00:35:41.877
That Rat Ming

307
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.543
was trying to haggle over every cent,

308
00:35:46.627 --> 00:35:48.460
so I stabbed him a few times.

309
00:35:49.377 --> 00:35:51.502
Want me to put on some ointment?

310
00:35:52.002 --> 00:35:54.543
I'm fine. No big deal.

311
00:35:55.335 --> 00:35:57.418
You want your headache pills?

312
00:35:57.793 --> 00:35:59.210
No need.

313
00:36:04.252 --> 00:36:05.668
Clean this up.

314
00:36:07.835 --> 00:36:09.502
So? Anything to eat?

315
00:36:09.585 --> 00:36:12.835
Pig blood cake, duck blood,
deep-fried sandwich.


316
00:37:01.918 --> 00:37:03.460
Let's go for a smoke.

317
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.210
What were you laughing at?

318
00:37:10.043 --> 00:37:11.585
Nothing, boss.

319
00:37:11.668 --> 00:37:13.960
I asked you what were you laughing at.

320
00:37:14.877 --> 00:37:16.127
Sorry, boss.

321
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.002
Something must have made you laugh.

322
00:37:30.877 --> 00:37:33.918
If you give me a reason,
maybe I'll understand.


323
00:37:35.877 --> 00:37:39.502
But not saying anything really hurts me.

324
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:44.210
It means

325
00:37:44.293 --> 00:37:48.585
you have dirty thoughts
you don't dare to say.


326
00:37:55.627 --> 00:37:57.502
How many bottles have we had?

327
00:37:57.835 --> 00:37:58.835
Six.

328
00:38:02.585 --> 00:38:04.335
Finish this to make it seven.

329
00:38:30.418 --> 00:38:31.627
Give it to me.

330
00:38:51.543 --> 00:38:52.752
Enough.

331
00:38:53.293 --> 00:38:54.502
Enough.

332
00:39:01.252 --> 00:39:02.252
Close up.

333
00:39:13.502 --> 00:39:15.918
Go clean up your face. Hurry.

334
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.710
What are you eating?

335
00:40:23.002 --> 00:40:26.043
I got some stuff delivered
to your mom today.


336
00:40:28.543 --> 00:40:31.168
Prison rules are so annoying these days.

337
00:40:32.793 --> 00:40:35.502
Soup, frozen foods,

338
00:40:35.585 --> 00:40:37.877
pig blood and duck blood are all banned.

339
00:40:40.127 --> 00:40:42.668
Even coconut and passionfruit.

340
00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.418
Coconut I understand.

341
00:40:47.502 --> 00:40:49.835
You can kill someone with that.

342
00:40:49.918 --> 00:40:52.918
But banning passionfruit makes no sense.

343
00:40:53.002 --> 00:40:55.293
How can you kill someone
with a passionfruit?


344
00:40:55.835 --> 00:40:57.335
Choke them to death?

345
00:41:16.127 --> 00:41:17.627
Don't worry.

346
00:41:19.127 --> 00:41:22.710
I'll get my people on the inside
to look after your mom.


347
00:42:13.335 --> 00:42:14.418
Captain.

348
00:42:14.502 --> 00:42:16.585
Chang Kuei-ching's call records.

349
00:42:19.293 --> 00:42:21.668
They're mostly calls to her husband,

350
00:42:21.752 --> 00:42:24.127
but two other numbers popped up recently.

351
00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.377
One is a SIM bought
from a convenience store.


352
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.502
The other is a shop in Taichung.

353
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.210
What kind of shop?

354
00:42:31.293 --> 00:42:32.418
A hair salon.

355
00:42:32.502 --> 00:42:33.960
Hsiao
-Mei's Hair Salon.

356
00:42:35.877 --> 00:42:37.918
<i>The sun is out in south-central Taiwan.</i>

357
00:42:38.002 --> 00:42:42.085
<i>People in these areas
will start feeling the heat around noon,</i>


358
00:42:42.168 --> 00:42:44.335
<i>when temperatures reach 30-31 degrees.</i>

359
00:42:44.418 --> 00:42:47.043
<i>It will get much colder at night
in central regions.</i>


360
00:42:47.127 --> 00:42:49.752
<i>In the south,
the temperature gap remains large.</i>


361
00:42:49.835 --> 00:42:52.043
<i>But tomorrow's temperatures…</i>

362
00:43:15.418 --> 00:43:16.835
Excuse me.

363
00:43:17.918 --> 00:43:19.418
Are you here for a haircut?

364
00:43:20.127 --> 00:43:22.127
Please go inside first.

365
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.002
Do you want a cut or a shave?

366
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.543
Shave.

367
00:43:36.418 --> 00:43:38.668
Just a trim or shave everything off?

368
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:44.085
It's okay. Let's trim a little bit,
and you can decide from there.


369
00:43:44.168 --> 00:43:45.002
Okay.

370
00:43:45.085 --> 00:43:46.168
Please wait.

371
00:44:23.252 --> 00:44:25.752
You don't look like you're from Taichung.

372
00:44:27.043 --> 00:44:28.752
I'm here to see friends.

373
00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:33.627
When was the last time you shaved?

374
00:44:35.127 --> 00:44:36.835
A couple of days ago.

375
00:44:38.793 --> 00:44:41.502
Your growth hormones are impressive.

376
00:44:57.502 --> 00:44:59.210
That'll do for today.

377
00:45:01.085 --> 00:45:02.085
Thanks.

378
00:45:11.543 --> 00:45:13.335
How many times do
I have to tell you?

379
00:45:13.418 --> 00:45:17.085
The two sides need to be even.

380
00:45:18.585 --> 00:45:19.627
Sir.

381
00:45:20.252 --> 00:45:22.418
Do you understand Cantonese?

382
00:45:22.502 --> 00:45:23.502
A little.

383
00:45:23.543 --> 00:45:25.168
How about I fix it for you?

384
00:45:26.668 --> 00:45:27.668
Sure.

385
00:45:29.502 --> 00:45:32.835
Go upstairs and fetch my liquor.

386
00:45:37.043 --> 00:45:40.752
Not many come in
for just a beard trim.

387
00:45:40.835 --> 00:45:42.168
You're quite unusual.

388
00:45:42.418 --> 00:45:44.210
I've got a friendly catch-up,

389
00:45:45.085 --> 00:45:46.877
so I thought I'd get a trim.

390
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.752
Your friend owns a store around here?

391
00:45:52.377 --> 00:45:53.418
No.

392
00:45:55.377 --> 00:45:56.877
We're just meeting here

393
00:45:58.377 --> 00:45:59.793
to have a meal.

394
00:46:00.002 --> 00:46:01.668
Is it a guy

395
00:46:02.293 --> 00:46:04.335
or a girl?

396
00:46:06.835 --> 00:46:07.877
Both.

397
00:46:08.377 --> 00:46:09.918
Junior high classmates.

398
00:46:10.627 --> 00:46:13.377
So you're staying here tonight?

399
00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.627
If it gets too late tonight,
I'll head back tomorrow.


400
00:46:17.377 --> 00:46:18.793
Got a place to stay?

401
00:46:19.293 --> 00:46:21.627
Shouldn't be too hard to find one.

402
00:46:22.793 --> 00:46:24.335
You just arrived today?

403
00:46:27.793 --> 00:46:29.043
What was that?

404
00:46:29.543 --> 00:46:32.002
You just arrived today?

405
00:46:34.168 --> 00:46:35.252
Yeah.

406
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.668
But how come

407
00:46:39.752 --> 00:46:42.877
I feel like I saw you last night?

408
00:46:46.168 --> 00:46:47.627
Really?

409
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.460
Weren't you staying at the hotel
across the road?


410
00:46:53.627 --> 00:46:56.460
You were spying on me all night,

411
00:46:57.418 --> 00:46:59.252
yet you still pretend?

412
00:47:03.502 --> 00:47:04.668
Mister.

413
00:47:07.293 --> 00:47:09.043
You got the wrong person.

414
00:47:09.877 --> 00:47:12.252
Did you come to see Hsiao-mei?

415
00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:20.210
Who are you to her?

416
00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.918
Who owns the car outside?

417
00:47:35.002 --> 00:47:37.543
- Please move it.
- What's going on?


418
00:47:37.627 --> 00:47:39.418
There's a car blocking the street.

419
00:47:39.502 --> 00:47:42.168
- Move it now.
- I will, don't worry.


420
00:47:42.252 --> 00:47:43.877
We just stopped for a minute.

421
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.335
Sorry…

422
00:47:46.418 --> 00:47:48.085
Move the car, quickly.

423
00:47:48.627 --> 00:47:50.835
- I'm moving, can't you see?
- Hurry up.


424
00:47:51.085 --> 00:47:53.168
What the fuck are you doing?

425
00:47:53.252 --> 00:47:54.252
Buying cigarettes.

426
00:47:54.293 --> 00:47:55.293
Hurry up.

427
00:47:56.085 --> 00:47:57.543
Drive.

428
00:48:05.335 --> 00:48:06.710
Don't come again.

429
00:49:45.918 --> 00:49:48.293
Do you know that
guy who came in today?

430
00:49:48.377 --> 00:49:49.502
No.

431
00:49:49.585 --> 00:49:51.043
That guy

432
00:49:51.918 --> 00:49:54.377
was not who he said he was.

433
00:49:55.585 --> 00:49:58.043
Meeting with friends?

434
00:49:58.835 --> 00:50:01.168
He was looking for trouble.

435
00:50:02.043 --> 00:50:03.043
Really?

436
00:50:17.668 --> 00:50:19.127
I've decided.

437
00:50:20.127 --> 00:50:22.168
I'm going after Rat Ming.

438
00:50:24.293 --> 00:50:26.460
Steal his product while I'm at it,

439
00:50:29.585 --> 00:50:31.293
then go into hiding for a while.

440
00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.502
In Kinmen.

441
00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:37.460
Why?

442
00:50:38.543 --> 00:50:40.793
I've said it many times.

443
00:50:41.835 --> 00:50:44.877
You can't stay in
one place for too long.

444
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.335
Besides, the cops
will recognize me sooner or later.


445
00:50:56.252 --> 00:50:58.335
Is there a reason you want to stay?

446
00:50:59.252 --> 00:51:00.668
No.

447
00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:07.085
- Let's have hotpot next time.
- Let's drink.


448
00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:41.543
That was quick.

449
00:52:42.043 --> 00:52:42.960
Shopkeeper.

450
00:52:43.043 --> 00:52:44.043
Check.

451
00:53:04.502 --> 00:53:05.877
- Wait…
- Fuck.


452
00:53:17.335 --> 00:53:19.252
Shopkeeper, check.

453
00:53:21.585 --> 00:53:22.793
Wait…

454
00:53:23.835 --> 00:53:25.293
What's going on?

455
00:53:26.293 --> 00:53:28.252
I thought Boss was done.

456
00:54:05.335 --> 00:54:06.335
Stop!

457
00:58:23.793 --> 00:58:24.793
What's your name?

458
00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:27.460
Chen Kui-lin.

459
00:58:28.627 --> 00:58:30.168
Do I know you?

460
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.002
Tell me why.

461
00:58:40.377 --> 00:58:42.918
Tell me why.

462
01:00:11.502 --> 01:00:13.543
- You want to stay or go?
- Go.


463
01:01:29.418 --> 01:01:31.252
If the cops come for you,

464
01:01:33.793 --> 01:01:36.252
tell them I killed Hongkie.

465
01:01:38.377 --> 01:01:39.793
Why?

466
01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:49.877
I want everyone to know I killed Hongkie.

467
01:01:50.835 --> 01:01:52.252
Why?

468
01:01:55.543 --> 01:01:57.543
Do you have any other family?

469
01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:04.127
Hongkie was my only family.

470
01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.002
You married him?

471
01:02:16.835 --> 01:02:18.460
My mom married him.

472
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.418
She's serving time for Hongkie.

473
01:02:26.585 --> 01:02:29.752
Second-degree drug trafficking.

474
01:02:32.627 --> 01:02:34.335
NT$15 million fine.

475
01:02:40.377 --> 01:02:43.043
It's a debt I'll
never be able to repay.

476
01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:45.960
Why?

477
01:02:47.585 --> 01:02:51.377
Because she wants the whole world to know
she trafficked those drugs.


478
01:02:53.543 --> 01:02:54.752
Why?

479
01:02:58.127 --> 01:03:02.335
Because Hongkie
rescued her from another man.


480
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:12.668
Where are we going now?

481
01:03:37.168 --> 01:03:39.127
You can keep this car.

482
01:03:44.668 --> 01:03:46.418
Will we meet again?

483
01:04:07.002 --> 01:04:08.627
You're free now.

484
01:04:10.418 --> 01:04:11.460
Take care.

485
01:04:33.168 --> 01:04:36.668
<i>There was an execution-style shooting
at Taichung's Hsiao-Mei Hair Salon</i>


486
01:04:36.752 --> 01:04:38.585
<i>and a nearby beef noodle soup shop,</i>

487
01:04:38.668 --> 01:04:40.793
<i>resulting in the deaths of three men.</i>

488
01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:44.960
<i>An additional shooting victim was found
not far away in an abandoned greenhouse.</i>


489
01:04:45.043 --> 01:04:47.502
<i>Police believe the killings
may be related.</i>


490
01:04:47.585 --> 01:04:50.918
<i>Investigations have revealed
that one of the deceased is the</i>


491
01:04:51.002 --> 01:04:54.210
<i>notorious fugitive nicknamed Hongkie.</i>

492
01:04:54.293 --> 01:04:56.835
<i>A young woman was also kidnapped
during the incident,</i>


493
01:04:56.918 --> 01:05:00.710
<i>but managed to escape early this morning.</i>

494
01:05:01.252 --> 01:05:03.668
<i>According to the woman, surnamed Cheng,</i>

495
01:05:03.752 --> 01:05:08.043
<i>the murder suspect is also a fugitive
by the name of Chen Kui-lin.</i>


496
01:05:08.293 --> 01:05:11.210
<i>Four years ago,
he committed a fatal shooting</i>


497
01:05:11.293 --> 01:05:12.335

01:05:13.918 --> 01:05:16.918
<i>indicate a bigger gang conspiracy
behind the scenes?</i>


500
01:05:17.002 --> 01:05:21.793
<i>Police are reviewing surveillance footage
and pursuing the suspect.</i>


501
01:05:31.168 --> 01:05:32.918
Excuse me, is Yang Shu-chen here?

502
01:05:33.168 --> 01:05:34.710
What? Who?

503
01:05:36.877 --> 01:05:37.877
Her.

504
01:05:41.585 --> 01:05:42.877
Yang Shu-chen

505
01:05:43.002 --> 01:05:44.710
died three years ago.

506
01:05:44.793 --> 01:05:47.752
The cost of her cremation
had to be paid by the government.


507
01:05:47.835 --> 01:05:49.710
These were her belongings.

508
01:05:49.793 --> 01:05:50.877
Please check them.

NEW SPIRITUAL SOCIETY

One mistake can lead to
irreversible regret


511
01:06:17.335 --> 01:06:20.293
Forgo greed, anger and delusion
to become a new person


512

PENG 14 TOWNSHIP ROAD, HUXI TOWNSHIP,
PENGHU COUNTY


513
01:07:41.668 --> 01:07:45.085
This is plain congee, vegetables,
tofu, and bamboo shoots.


514
01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.627
Enjoy.

515
01:08:02.127 --> 01:08:03.918
This morning,

516
01:08:04.002 --> 01:08:06.877
I went shopping at the markets
with two brothers,


517
01:08:07.627 --> 01:08:09.210
where we met an old lady.

518
01:08:11.293 --> 01:08:12.752
She asked me,

519
01:08:13.585 --> 01:08:16.252
why does she feel like
she's toiled her entire life,


520
01:08:16.335 --> 01:08:17.960
yet still has nothing?

521
01:08:20.918 --> 01:08:22.335
I asked her,

522
01:08:23.377 --> 01:08:25.377
what's wrong with having nothing?

523
01:08:26.377 --> 01:08:27.752
What do you think?

524
01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:33.585
Isn't it good to live without a purpose?

525
01:08:34.085 --> 01:08:36.793
Purpose is invented by man,

526
01:08:36.877 --> 01:08:39.627
so it must surely relate
to worldly things.


527
01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:42.585
Blindly pursuing worldly desires

528
01:08:42.668 --> 01:08:45.043
is a foolish thing.

529
01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:48.252
Greed,

530
01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.960
anger,

531
01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:51.710
and delusion

532
01:08:52.335 --> 01:08:54.210
are the roots of all suffering.

533
01:08:54.918 --> 01:08:57.627
These are all life-wasting poisons.

534
01:08:57.710 --> 01:08:59.710
So, looking back,

535
01:09:00.543 --> 01:09:03.502
perhaps the meaning of life

536
01:09:04.293 --> 01:09:06.460
is to have no meaning at all.

537
01:09:07.002 --> 01:09:13.002

01:09:31.168 --> 01:09:36.168
<i>The journey of life</i>

542
01:09:37.127 --> 01:09:42.210
<i>Requires how many tears to complete?</i>

543
01:09:43.418 --> 01:09:45.835
<i>Do I have a
horizon to look forward to?</i>

544
01:09:45.918 --> 01:09:48.752
Your Holiness, I finally got to see you.
I'm so happy.


545
01:09:48.835 --> 01:09:51.252
Thank you so much.

546
01:09:51.335 --> 01:09:53.877
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.


547
01:09:55.877 --> 01:09:57.127
Your Holiness.

548
01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:58.835
Your Holiness, thank you.

549
01:09:58.918 --> 01:10:00.502
Thank you so much.

550
01:10:00.585 --> 01:10:02.585
Your Holiness, thank you.

551
01:10:02.668 --> 01:10:09.043
<i>Is completed by my yearning and your smile</i>

552
01:10:09.127 --> 01:10:14.335
<i>You can open my door to freedom</i>

553
01:10:24.252 --> 01:10:25.835
This kind of medicine

554
01:10:25.918 --> 01:10:28.085
is used for treating lung cancer.

555
01:10:31.585 --> 01:10:32.668
Your Holiness.

556
01:10:43.585 --> 01:10:44.668
You're awake.

557
01:10:47.252 --> 01:10:48.585
How do you feel?

558
01:10:49.627 --> 01:10:52.627
You just vomited black water.
Did you know that?


559
01:10:57.085 --> 01:10:59.585
There's something unclean inside you.

560
01:11:01.002 --> 01:11:02.627
What's unclean?

561
01:11:03.668 --> 01:11:08.085
There are some things you can comprehend,
and others you will never understand.


562
01:11:08.168 --> 01:11:10.127
But don't worry.

563
01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:11.877
Get some rest.

564
01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.252
Everything will get better.

565
01:11:25.627 --> 01:11:27.918
There's a class at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow.

566
01:11:28.002 --> 01:11:30.252
Come if you have the energy.

ASSEMBLY HALL

568
01:12:25.668 --> 01:12:29.543
I was once
a terminal cervical cancer patient.


569
01:12:30.252 --> 01:12:33.627
Every day felt like a countdown.

570
01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:38.335
I never knew when
death would come for me.


571
01:12:42.668 --> 01:12:44.960
I'm very thankful to His Holiness…

572
01:12:47.293 --> 01:12:48.960
for enlightening me.

573
01:12:50.377 --> 01:12:54.752
His enlightenment
is more effective than any surgery.


574
01:12:54.877 --> 01:12:59.377
Because of him,
I have become a brand new person.


575
01:12:59.877 --> 01:13:01.543
Right now,

576
01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:03.127
I am very healthy,

577
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:07.710
without need for any medication
or any treatment.


578
01:13:07.793 --> 01:13:11.252
I hope Your Holiness
can enlighten me again


579
01:13:11.335 --> 01:13:13.210
and bestow a child upon me.

580
01:13:13.585 --> 01:13:15.627
We have all forgotten

581
01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:18.335
that we are our best doctor.

582
01:13:18.793 --> 01:13:20.627
All the medicine in the world

583
01:13:21.418 --> 01:13:24.002
cannot compare to your own enlightenment.

584
01:13:26.252 --> 01:13:29.418
<i>I once wandered aimlessly</i>

585
01:13:29.502 --> 01:13:31.627
Only by letting go of attachments

586
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.543
can one become a brand new person.

587

<i>Unable to find the right direction</i>

589
01:14:02.335 --> 01:14:03.377
Your Holiness.

590
01:14:07.793 --> 01:14:09.752
You seem much better.

591
01:14:10.543 --> 01:14:12.293
There's still hope for you.

592
01:14:12.793 --> 01:14:14.002
Come, sit.

593
01:14:20.293 --> 01:14:21.710
This book is for you.

594
01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:25.002
Read it in your spare time.

595
01:14:27.418 --> 01:14:28.877
Who wrote it?

596
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.210
I did.

597
01:14:33.293 --> 01:14:34.918
So you wrote it?

598
01:14:35.002 --> 01:14:36.793
I wrote the words,

599
01:14:36.877 --> 01:14:39.127
though the one
who inspired them is not me,


600
01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:40.627
but someone else.

601
01:14:44.502 --> 01:14:46.293
Why did you come here?

602
01:14:50.168 --> 01:14:51.918
I'm looking for someone.

603
01:14:52.627 --> 01:14:53.627
Who?

604
01:14:54.668 --> 01:14:56.168
His name is Lin Lu-ho.

605
01:14:58.210 --> 01:14:59.960
You're a cop?

606
01:15:01.835 --> 01:15:03.752
I'm not a cop.

607
01:15:03.835 --> 01:15:06.043
Then you must be a gangster.

608
01:15:07.043 --> 01:15:09.252
I was entrusted to give something to him.

609
01:15:10.418 --> 01:15:12.543
I must hand it to him myself.

610
01:15:24.752 --> 01:15:26.585
This is who you're looking for.

611
01:15:30.127 --> 01:15:32.543
Perhaps he doesn't want to be remembered.

612
01:15:33.585 --> 01:15:35.002
When did he die?

613
01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:37.460
A long time ago.

614
01:15:37.543 --> 01:15:41.043
I think he was
a fugitive at the time.

615
01:15:41.127 --> 01:15:42.710
Constantly on the run.

616
01:15:44.335 --> 01:15:46.627
He ended up in Penghu.

617
01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:51.460
I was a doctor
on the island back then.

618
01:15:53.418 --> 01:15:55.668
I received a call at 2:00 a.m.

619
01:15:56.585 --> 01:16:00.460
telling me there's a patient in the ER,
covered in blood,


620
01:16:01.502 --> 01:16:03.335
and they asked me to come in.

621
01:16:19.835 --> 01:16:20.877
Sir.

622
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:22.585
What happened?

623
01:16:23.502 --> 01:16:24.918
Don't save me.

624
01:16:26.293 --> 01:16:28.127
I'm a sinner.

625
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.043
I don't deserve salvation.

626
01:16:34.918 --> 01:16:37.085
It was God's plan

627
01:16:37.877 --> 01:16:40.335
for me to meet you all here.

628
01:16:41.752 --> 01:16:42.918
Tonight,

629
01:16:43.793 --> 01:16:45.627
I shall be buried here.

630
01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:48.252
I saw my grave,

631
01:16:50.877 --> 01:16:54.002
and I also saw your graves.

632
01:16:57.127 --> 01:16:59.752
I saw the moment the universe was born.

633
01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:04.835
I saw my life,

634
01:17:07.293 --> 01:17:09.918
and I also saw your lives.

635
01:17:26.543 --> 01:17:28.877
He knew all of our names,

636
01:17:29.668 --> 01:17:31.210
where we were born,

637
01:17:31.668 --> 01:17:33.877
and at what age we will die.

638
01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.960
He was an extraordinary person.

639
01:17:36.835 --> 01:17:38.460
In the end,

640
01:17:38.543 --> 01:17:42.043
he instructed us
to find a spot in Huxi Township


641
01:17:42.127 --> 01:17:44.585
and establish the New Spiritual Society,

642
01:17:44.668 --> 01:17:47.002
to free all sentient beings
from suffering.


643
01:17:48.835 --> 01:17:50.460
Perhaps,

644
01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:54.085
you hold some grudge against Lin Lu-ho.

645
01:17:55.085 --> 01:17:57.752
But if you don't let go
of your attachments,


646
01:17:58.377 --> 01:18:00.835
your death will be near.

647
01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:02.710
Will I die here?

648
01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:04.502
I don't know.

649
01:18:04.835 --> 01:18:06.710
I can't make you live forever.

650
01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:09.002
I can only treat your illness.

651
01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.210
A person's death

652
01:18:12.293 --> 01:18:14.502
is always the result of their own actions.

653
01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:09.085
Every time I say a line,
you repeat after me.


654
01:19:14.043 --> 01:19:15.543
I thank heaven and earth.

655
01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:17.960
I thank heaven and earth!

656
01:19:18.668 --> 01:19:20.127
I thank my parents.

657
01:19:20.627 --> 01:19:22.335
I thank my parents!

658
01:19:22.918 --> 01:19:26.543
- I'm a sinner.
- I'm a sinner!


659
01:19:27.835 --> 01:19:29.252
I have harmed the world.

660
01:19:30.043 --> 01:19:31.710
I have harmed the world!

661
01:19:32.335 --> 01:19:33.918
I let the world down.

662
01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:36.335
I let the world down!

663
01:19:44.293 --> 01:19:46.168
I'm willing to abandon everything.

664
01:19:47.377 --> 01:19:49.252
I'm willing to abandon everything!

665
01:19:50.627 --> 01:19:55.085
- Forgo fame, fortune, and power.
- Forgo fame, fortune, and power!


666
01:19:56.793 --> 01:20:01.502
- Give up money and material possessions.
- Give up money and material possessions!


667
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.543
Return to my true self.

668
01:20:05.585 --> 01:20:07.627
Return to my true self!

669
01:21:24.168 --> 01:21:25.168
I'm heading over.

670
01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.710
You said you had to give something
to Lin Lu-ho.


671
01:21:42.793 --> 01:21:43.918
What is it?

672
01:21:46.418 --> 01:21:47.918
His mother's ashes.

673
01:21:51.210 --> 01:21:53.085
You knew his mother?

674
01:22:06.335 --> 01:22:08.293
You said you have terminal lung cancer?

675
01:22:08.835 --> 01:22:10.835
Yes. Stage 4.

676
01:22:11.543 --> 01:22:12.543
Stage 4.

677
01:22:15.293 --> 01:22:17.043
But from what I can see,

678
01:22:17.127 --> 01:22:19.210
it's not as serious as you say.

679
01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:23.377
Based on this X-ray,

680
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.002
I can't confirm that you are stage 4.

681
01:22:27.502 --> 01:22:29.418
This shadow here

682
01:22:30.335 --> 01:22:32.627
could be cancer cells,

683
01:22:32.710 --> 01:22:35.835
but a biopsy would give us more certainty.

684
01:22:36.668 --> 01:22:38.543
There's also these white parts.

685
01:22:39.127 --> 01:22:41.002
Signs of calcification.

686
01:22:41.085 --> 01:22:44.085
This is recovering tissue.

687
01:22:46.002 --> 01:22:47.127
If you say

688
01:22:48.043 --> 01:22:50.877
you had stage 4 cancer before,

689
01:22:51.793 --> 01:22:54.710
that means your cancer cells
are self-destructing.


690
01:23:01.418 --> 01:23:03.918
How could you…rip up my X-ray?

691
01:23:05.002 --> 01:23:06.793
You ripped it.

692
01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:13.168
Does that mean he'll recover?

693
01:23:13.918 --> 01:23:14.918
That's…

694
01:23:15.543 --> 01:23:16.793
hard to say.

695
01:23:17.585 --> 01:23:20.293
Such miracles aren't impossible.

696
01:23:21.085 --> 01:23:22.877
But it's very rare.

697
01:23:23.377 --> 01:23:28.168
I think we need to observe for a little
longer before reaching any conclusions.


698
01:24:12.293 --> 01:24:13.502
Your Holiness.

699
01:24:13.585 --> 01:24:16.002
- I made this especially for you.
- Please sit.


700
01:24:16.502 --> 01:24:18.585
This is Lin Lu-ho's mother's ashes.

701
01:24:18.918 --> 01:24:21.043
This is the money I brought with me.

702
01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:24.168
How much money is in here?

703
01:24:25.502 --> 01:24:26.793
NT$1 million.

704
01:24:26.877 --> 01:24:28.252
Put it inside.

705
01:24:37.127 --> 01:24:38.752
Any money in bank accounts?

706
01:24:40.335 --> 01:24:41.543
It's all here.

707
01:24:42.585 --> 01:24:44.585
Put your watch in there too.

708
01:24:55.627 --> 01:24:57.252
Not this.

709
01:25:00.252 --> 01:25:02.918
My grandma left me this.

710
01:25:03.543 --> 01:25:07.377
I know it's not easy letting go
of worldly possessions.


711
01:25:08.377 --> 01:25:10.668
If you are still hesitant,

712
01:25:11.335 --> 01:25:13.418
it means the timing is not right.

713
01:25:14.335 --> 01:25:15.502
That's okay,

714
01:25:16.418 --> 01:25:18.418
you can take it all back.

715
01:26:51.793 --> 01:26:53.793
Serve the food, and give this to Pao.

716
01:26:53.877 --> 01:26:54.877
Okay.

717
01:27:02.002 --> 01:27:04.127
Did you come here by yourself?

718
01:27:04.210 --> 01:27:05.918
No, I came with my mom.

719
01:27:06.002 --> 01:27:07.835
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.


720
01:27:07.918 --> 01:27:09.460
- This is yours.
- Thank you.


721
01:27:09.543 --> 01:27:10.543
Welcome.

722
01:27:11.210 --> 01:27:13.710
Senior sister.
I'll get another serving for you.


723
01:27:13.793 --> 01:27:15.335
- No need, I'm fasting.
- Okay.


724
01:27:15.418 --> 01:27:16.293
Thanks.

725
01:27:16.377 --> 01:27:18.127
Let me know if you're hungry.

726
01:27:18.418 --> 01:27:20.085
Okay, thank you.

727
01:27:20.168 --> 01:27:21.543
Bye.

728
01:27:25.168 --> 01:27:27.960
Where do you think
you'll go when you die?

729
01:27:28.043 --> 01:27:29.168
Heaven.

730
01:27:30.543 --> 01:27:32.627
How do you know you'll go to heaven?

731
01:27:32.710 --> 01:27:35.168
Because I'm good and don't do bad things.

732
01:27:38.210 --> 01:27:39.918
Do you often hurt small animals?

733
01:27:40.002 --> 01:27:42.752
No, I love small animals.

734
01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.502
- Do you eat shrimp?
- Yes.


735
01:27:47.502 --> 01:27:49.377
- Fish?
- Yes.


736
01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.460
Shrimp tastes better than fish.

737
01:27:55.835 --> 01:27:57.002
Pao!

738
01:27:59.002 --> 01:28:01.085
Pao! Pao, are you all right?

739
01:28:01.543 --> 01:28:03.460
Pao, what's happening to you?

740
01:28:04.252 --> 01:28:06.543
- Let me have a look.
- What's happening?


741
01:28:06.627 --> 01:28:09.127
- Pao…
- Should we take him to the hospital?


742
01:28:09.210 --> 01:28:11.127
Ma'am, please calm down.

743
01:28:11.210 --> 01:28:12.710
Let His Holiness take a look.

744
01:28:12.793 --> 01:28:14.752
- Get him to the hospital.
- Flip him over.


745
01:28:14.835 --> 01:28:15.835
Let him lie down.

746
01:28:15.918 --> 01:28:17.335
Get him to the hospital.

747
01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:20.418
Perhaps he ate too quickly.

748
01:28:21.335 --> 01:28:22.210
Is he okay?

749
01:28:22.293 --> 01:28:23.335
He's fine.

750
01:28:23.752 --> 01:28:24.752
Hospital.

751
01:28:25.543 --> 01:28:26.543
Hospital.

752
01:28:27.668 --> 01:28:28.668
Hospital.

753
01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:31.877
Hospital. let's go to the hospital.

754
01:28:49.918 --> 01:28:51.085
Close the door.

755
01:28:57.043 --> 01:28:58.793
You put too much in his food.

756
01:28:59.293 --> 01:29:00.293
Me?

757
01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.793
- It was the same as always.
- He's a kid.


758
01:29:02.877 --> 01:29:05.085
Kids don't require such a big dose.

759
01:29:13.585 --> 01:29:15.918
Why did you interrupt His Holiness?

760
01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:20.043
You're responsible
if anything happens to this kid.


761
01:29:20.127 --> 01:29:21.168
Get out.

762
01:29:41.168 --> 01:29:43.877
Your son has a chest infection.

763
01:29:45.585 --> 01:29:47.793
You can see this shadow here.

764
01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.627
It might be pulmonary edema.

765
01:29:50.502 --> 01:29:53.168
And you see these white areas?

766
01:29:54.377 --> 01:29:56.793
It may be an infection or pneumothorax.

767
01:29:56.877 --> 01:29:59.627
How is that possible?
He was perfectly fine before.


768
01:29:59.710 --> 01:30:02.835
Does your son
have any history of chronic illness?


769
01:30:02.918 --> 01:30:05.335
No, he's always been in good health.

770
01:30:05.418 --> 01:30:07.377
He's just not very sharp.

771
01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.627
How could this happen all of a sudden?

772
01:30:09.918 --> 01:30:11.085
It's very strange.

773
01:30:11.168 --> 01:30:13.877
This isn't something
that develops in a few days.


774
01:30:14.127 --> 01:30:15.127
Your Holiness.

775
01:30:15.793 --> 01:30:17.335
Please have mercy.

776
01:30:17.418 --> 01:30:19.918
Please save my son. I beg you.

777
01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:25.293
He just vomited black water.

778
01:30:25.835 --> 01:30:28.502
There's probably something
unclean inside him.


779
01:30:30.168 --> 01:30:31.960
I'll take care of it for you.

780
01:32:32.793 --> 01:32:34.502
Don't let him die.

781
01:32:35.293 --> 01:32:36.293
Okay.

782
01:32:37.127 --> 01:32:38.960
But don't let him recover either.

783
01:32:43.293 --> 01:32:45.668
I want to keep him like this forever.

784
01:32:47.085 --> 01:32:48.543
Can you do that?

785
01:33:36.543 --> 01:33:38.668
I made this especially for you.

786
01:33:38.752 --> 01:33:40.377
Please sit.

787
01:33:41.918 --> 01:33:45.210
Now put your passbook and stamp inside.

788
01:33:50.377 --> 01:33:51.710
And your debit card?

789
01:33:54.293 --> 01:33:56.918
These are all vanity possessions.

790
01:33:59.543 --> 01:34:01.627
And the ring on your finger.

791
01:34:03.918 --> 01:34:05.668
This is my wedding ring.

792
01:34:07.168 --> 01:34:09.460
I don't have anything left.

793
01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:11.293
This is all I have.

794
01:34:11.752 --> 01:34:13.918
You are doing this for your son.

795
01:34:17.043 --> 01:34:18.793
It's this kind of obsession

796
01:34:18.877 --> 01:34:21.543
that led to your husband's
premature death.


797
01:34:23.377 --> 01:34:27.502
If you don't repent now,
the next victim will be your son.


798
01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.793
Go get ready first.

799
01:35:38.835 --> 01:35:40.793
Thank you, Your Holiness.

800
01:36:08.627 --> 01:36:11.710
Every time I say a line,
you repeat after me.


801
01:36:16.335 --> 01:36:17.835
I thank heaven and earth.

802
01:36:18.752 --> 01:36:20.418
I thank heaven and earth!

803
01:36:21.418 --> 01:36:23.085
I thank my parents.

804
01:36:23.877 --> 01:36:25.627
I thank my parents!

805
01:36:27.043 --> 01:36:28.585
I'm a sinner.

806
01:36:29.002 --> 01:36:31.043
I'm a sinner!

807
01:36:32.085 --> 01:36:33.502
I have harmed the world.

808
01:36:34.252 --> 01:36:36.127
I have harmed the world!

809
01:36:37.252 --> 01:36:39.043
I let the world down.

810
01:36:39.835 --> 01:36:41.710
I let the world down!

811
01:37:00.418 --> 01:37:01.627
Pack your things.

812
01:37:01.710 --> 01:37:02.877
Go get your son.

813
01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:04.543
They can't help you.

814
01:37:05.710 --> 01:37:07.293
- Get lost.
- Take it.


815
01:37:07.377 --> 01:37:08.793
Take it.

816
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.793
Get your son out of here!

817
01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:14.210
Go get him!

818
01:37:16.418 --> 01:37:17.710
Get your son!

819
01:37:22.668 --> 01:37:25.085
Demonic forces are messing with your mind.

820
01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:30.627
Compassion in the wrong place
will only hurt yourself.


821
01:37:33.168 --> 01:37:34.168
Go!

822
01:37:40.293 --> 01:37:42.418
Go. Go!

823
01:37:44.918 --> 01:37:48.710
Your compassion and indecision
will only lead to catastrophe!


824
01:37:49.293 --> 01:37:55.293
Kill! Kill! Kill!

825
01:38:00.877 --> 01:38:01.877
Go.

826
01:38:06.043 --> 01:38:07.210
Go!

827
01:38:52.127 --> 01:38:54.668
Full of karmic obstacles.
A harm to the world.


828
01:38:55.668 --> 01:38:57.627
Send them to hell together.

829
01:40:07.043 --> 01:40:12.793
<i>Look at his white wings</i>

830
01:40:13.127 --> 01:40:17.668
<i>Dazzling and flawless</i>

831
01:40:19.002 --> 01:40:24.877

01:40:37.377 --> 01:40:43.127

YANG SHU
-CHEN AND SON

839
01:43:14.585 --> 01:43:16.252
I have a gift for you.

840
01:43:18.585 --> 01:43:21.210
Do you think it's a boy or girl?

841
01:43:29.752 --> 01:43:31.793
I keep saying I have cancer every day.

842
01:43:33.252 --> 01:43:34.502
Luckily,

843
01:43:35.168 --> 01:43:36.752
none of it is true.

844
01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:53.543
I was once a terminal
cervical cancer patient.


845
01:43:54.752 --> 01:43:56.585
During that time,

846
01:43:56.668 --> 01:43:58.710
every day was like a countdown.

847
01:44:03.710 --> 01:44:06.168
I'm very thankful to His Holiness

848
01:44:08.418 --> 01:44:11.127
for being willing to enlighten me.

849
01:44:17.127 --> 01:44:18.252
Love

850
01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:21.918
is God's greatest gift to us.

851
01:44:38.877 --> 01:44:42.043
We've all forgotten that
we are the best people.


852
01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:08.043
Lin Lu-ho.

853
01:46:16.377 --> 01:46:18.002
Lin Lu-ho.

854
01:46:21.127 --> 01:46:22.793
Nickname, "Bullhead".

855
01:46:29.752 --> 01:46:32.127
Committed more than 50 shootings.

856
01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:34.960
Killed six police officers.

857
01:46:40.085 --> 01:46:41.085
That's you.

858
01:46:46.293 --> 01:46:47.918
A natural disaster

859
01:46:48.793 --> 01:46:50.252
or an earthquake

860
01:46:51.877 --> 01:46:54.085
can kill countless innocent people.

861
01:46:57.002 --> 01:46:58.752
Do you hate the heavens?

862
01:47:00.168 --> 01:47:01.835
Do you hate the earth?

863
01:47:03.043 --> 01:47:05.668
All we do is
kill a few more people.

864
01:47:06.752 --> 01:47:08.543
What's the big deal?

865
01:47:13.252 --> 01:47:14.293
Right?

866
01:47:17.585 --> 01:47:20.168
Talking tough
even when you're about to die.


867
01:47:20.835 --> 01:47:23.002
You truly deserve to die.

868
01:47:26.877 --> 01:47:29.418
I asked for a
sign from Holy Emperor Guan.

869
01:47:33.002 --> 01:47:35.585
That day,
he gave me nine divination sticks.


870
01:47:40.585 --> 01:47:43.335
If the next nine
bullets in my gun jam,

871
01:47:47.793 --> 01:47:48.835
I'll leave.

872
01:47:51.377 --> 01:47:53.835
If not, then it's God's will.

873
01:47:56.335 --> 01:48:00.085
It's God punishing you
for playing with people's lives.


874
01:49:03.043 --> 01:49:09.710
<i>I once wandered aimlessly</i>

875
01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:13.502
<i>On the dark night road</i>

876
01:49:15.668 --> 01:49:21.960
<i>The gentle breeze pricks my soul</i>

877
01:49:22.043 --> 01:49:26.918
<i>Unable to find the right direction</i>

878
01:49:36.418 --> 01:49:38.835
I'll give everybody one minute.

879
01:49:38.918 --> 01:49:40.835
Those who choose to stay

880
01:49:41.668 --> 01:49:42.918
will end up like him.

881
01:49:48.127 --> 01:49:52.918
<i>The journey of life</i>

882
01:49:53.877 --> 01:49:57.377
<i>Requires how many tears to complete?</i>

883
01:49:57.460 --> 01:49:59.127
Time is almost up.

884
01:50:00.085 --> 01:50:01.710
Ten,

885
01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.668
nine,

886
01:50:03.752 --> 01:50:05.085

893
01:50:17.793 --> 01:50:18.793

896
01:53:12.293 --> 01:53:13.293
Hey.

897
01:53:14.043 --> 01:53:15.835
I'm already on the boat.

898
01:53:17.543 --> 01:53:19.418
You should've come with me.

899
01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:22.002
It's a four-hour ride.

900
01:53:22.418 --> 01:53:24.460
You have to pick me up later.

901
01:53:25.835 --> 01:53:27.293
It's so pretty outside.

902
01:53:29.377 --> 01:53:30.960
Let me borrow your phone.

903
01:53:31.835 --> 01:53:33.252
Sorry.

904
01:53:34.877 --> 01:53:38.043
Your friend can't talk right now.
Sorry about that.


905
01:53:45.210 --> 01:53:46.377
Chen Hui.

906
01:54:39.168 --> 01:54:40.752
Don't come any closer!

907
01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:43.793
Chen Hui!

908
01:54:52.335 --> 01:54:53.793
Chen Hui!

909
01:55:07.085 --> 01:55:08.543
Thanks for your help.

910
01:55:52.752 --> 01:55:54.335
Chen Kui-lin, over here!

911
01:55:57.335 --> 01:55:59.043
Chen Kui-lin, over here!

912
01:56:06.293 --> 01:56:07.585
Do you regret it?

913
01:56:11.293 --> 01:56:13.168
My name is Chen Kui-lin!

914
01:56:14.668 --> 01:56:16.543
Chen Kui-lin!

915
01:56:16.835 --> 01:56:17.835
Get in.

916
01:56:18.543 --> 01:56:19.668
Okay, get in.

917
01:56:43.168 --> 01:56:47.210
<i>The gangster murder case in Taichung
finally has a new development.</i>


918
01:56:47.627 --> 01:56:52.252
After killing the fugitive Hongkie,
Chen Kui-lin has struck again today.


919
01:56:52.335 --> 01:56:56.127
The crime took place in Penghu,
at a spiritual center in Huxi Township.


920
01:57:31.293 --> 01:57:33.418
What happened to you?

921
01:57:39.793 --> 01:57:42.543
You're on the news every day.

922
01:57:43.210 --> 01:57:45.293
You must be happy.

923
01:57:46.793 --> 01:57:49.085
I had a health
check when I arrived here.

924
01:57:52.002 --> 01:57:53.877
The doctor told me

925
01:57:55.543 --> 01:57:57.460
I never had lung cancer.

926
01:58:01.918 --> 01:58:04.252
I started thinking these last few days.

927
01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:08.543
Could it really be a miracle?

928
01:58:09.668 --> 01:58:12.002
Did Lin Lu-ho really heal me?

929
01:58:17.085 --> 01:58:20.293
If you had lung cancer
and suddenly recovered,


930
01:58:20.377 --> 01:58:22.252
then that's a miracle.

931
01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:27.085
But if you never even had it,
it's just superstition.


932
01:58:29.835 --> 01:58:31.752
So that X-ray

933
01:58:33.835 --> 01:58:35.335
wasn't mine.

934
01:58:36.752 --> 01:58:38.793
That was my lung.

935
01:58:41.210 --> 01:58:42.793
Why?

936
01:58:49.627 --> 01:58:52.043
The day I got
the report at the hospital,

937
01:58:52.127 --> 01:58:54.293
my college classmate told me,

938
01:58:55.335 --> 01:58:58.043
"Kuei-ching, you're a doctor too."

939
01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:01.627
I suddenly felt so ashamed.

940
01:59:02.710 --> 01:59:05.043
What have I been doing all these years?

941
01:59:06.377 --> 01:59:08.543
Helping all you gangsters

942
01:59:09.668 --> 01:59:12.335
extract bullets,
stitch up knife wounds.


943
01:59:13.377 --> 01:59:16.168
Was I saving people or harming people?

944
01:59:20.127 --> 01:59:22.585
I initially wanted to accumulate
some good deeds


945
01:59:22.668 --> 01:59:24.543
by tricking you to turn yourself in.

946
01:59:27.793 --> 01:59:30.835
I never thought
it would turn out like this.


947
01:59:34.793 --> 01:59:36.585
But come to think of it,

948
01:59:37.918 --> 01:59:40.377
I did kill three birds with one stone.

949
01:59:41.918 --> 01:59:43.668
I accumulated my good deeds,

950
01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:46.543
you became infamous,

951
01:59:48.210 --> 01:59:50.585
and society has three less criminals.

952
01:59:54.418 --> 01:59:56.543
Isn't that a good thing?

953
01:59:59.085 --> 02:00:00.877
I'm glad I fell for it.

954
02:00:05.002 --> 02:00:06.460
Perhaps,

955
02:00:08.918 --> 02:00:12.252
it was the world's most useful lie.

956
02:00:57.710 --> 02:00:58.710
Not this.

957
02:01:00.127 --> 02:01:01.835
Not this either.

958
02:01:07.585 --> 02:01:09.293
Not these two.

959
02:01:10.585 --> 02:01:12.585
- Is that all?
- That's everything.


960
02:01:13.418 --> 02:01:15.627
These are all banned under the rules.

961
02:01:24.835 --> 02:01:25.835
Warden.

962
02:01:26.543 --> 02:01:27.960
Take a look at this.

963
02:01:29.377 --> 02:01:31.043
This is mine.

964
02:01:31.127 --> 02:01:33.752
It's old, blunt and harmless.

965
02:01:34.585 --> 02:01:35.918
Please allow it.

966
02:04:35.918 --> 02:04:37.252
Goodbye.

967
02:04:38.002 --> 02:04:39.252
Goodbye.

968
02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:23.752
Chen Kui-lin asked me to give you this.

No, thank you.
