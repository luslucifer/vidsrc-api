00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:55.744
- Yes?

<i>(woman): Collect call from Zoe.
Will you accept the charges?</i>


12
00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.999
- Yes, I'll... accept the charges.

13
00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:03.293
<i>(girl): Daddy? It's me.
How are you doing?</i>


14
00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.754
<i>- Hi! Fine.
- That's great.</i>

(brushing)

16
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:08.966
<i>Where are you?
What's that sound?</i>


17
00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:11.301
- I'm in a carwash.

18
00:04:11.427 --> 00:04:15.347
- Wow! I've never talked to you
when you've been in a carwash before.


19
00:04:15.473 --> 00:04:17.307
Îœake sure you've got
all the windows rolled up.


20
00:04:17.475 --> 00:04:20.352
Remember the time that...
that we were in the carwash,


21
00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:23.605
and I started playing
with the automatic window?


22
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.316
How old was I, Daddy?

23
00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:28.986
<i>I got absolutely soaked, remember?</i>

24
00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:30.988
- Why are you calling me, Zoe?

25
00:04:31.155 --> 00:04:34.032
<i>- Why am I calling you?
You're my father.</i>


26
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.743
What, I'm not supposed to call you?

27
00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:39.121
What's... what's the matter with
wanting to talk to you, Daddy?


28
00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:41.999
- Nothing's wrong with trying
to talk to me, Zoe.


29
00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:43.917
<i>
- Then what's the problem?</i>

30
00:04:44.043 --> 00:04:45.335
- The problem is...

31
00:04:47.547 --> 00:04:50.299
The problem is I don't know
who I'm talking to right now.


32
00:04:50.717 --> 00:04:52.926
- Oh, 'cause you think I'm stoned,
Daddy?


33
00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:56.054
Is that what you're thinking?
I've got a needle stuck in my arm?


34
00:04:56.222 --> 00:04:59.391
<i>Are you thinking that I've scored, Daddy,
that I'm calling you for money?</i>


35
00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.978
That I'm begging?
God, I don't fucking believe this.


36
00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:06.773
<i>Daddy, are you listening to me?!
Daddy!</i>


37
00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:08.442
Daddy!

38
00:05:11.195 --> 00:05:12.612
- Yes...

39
00:05:12.697 --> 00:05:14.614
<i>
- Why can't you talk to me?</i>

40
00:05:17.994 --> 00:05:21.204
- Because I need to know
what state you're in, Zoe...


41
00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.957
before I know how to talk to you.

42
00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:26.168
(man): Come on, let's go.

43
00:05:26.336 --> 00:05:27.627
- Daddy!

<i>Speak a little softer</i>

48

<i>And wink a little louder</i>

49
00:05:59.952 --> 00:06:03.830
<i>And shoot less with more care</i>

50
00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:07.584
<i>And sing a little sweeter</i>

51
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.545
<i>And love a little longer</i>

52
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:15.592
<i>And soon you will be there</i>

53

54
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.474
<i>All we have here is sky</i>

55

<i>All the sky is
is blue</i>


56

<i>All the blue is</i>

57
00:06:31.776 --> 00:06:37.030
<i>Is one more colour</i>

58
00:06:37.573 --> 00:06:47.573
<i>One more colour</i>

59
00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:51.878
<i>Now</i>

60
00:06:54.006 --> 00:06:55.799
- Well, that was great.
- Really?


61
00:06:55.925 --> 00:06:58.135
- You're gonna blow
everyone away.


62
00:06:58.261 --> 00:06:59.386
- You mean it?
- Of course.


63
00:06:59.512 --> 00:07:01.763
- You don't sound like...
completely sure.


64
00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.765
(indistinct chatter)
- I am.


65
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.310
Really.

66
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.772
It was awesome.

67
00:07:11.858 --> 00:07:14.443
(chuckling)
- I'm so happy, Daddy.


68
00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:18.780
(mooing)

69
00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:21.324
Let's get some ice cream, Daddy.

(woman): Yes, go ahead, please.

75
00:07:42.472 --> 00:07:46.725

in a strange situation.

I'm
-I'm calling from my car.

77
00:07:48.853 --> 00:07:51.229
And I appear to be stuck
in a carwash.


78
00:07:51.355 --> 00:07:52.230
<i>
- A carwash?</i>

79
00:07:52.356 --> 00:07:54.232
- Right. Yeah, a carwash.
Uh...


80
00:07:54.358 --> 00:07:57.360
<i>- Can you speak a little louder,
please, sir?</i>

I'm losing you again.</i>

91
00:09:49.849 --> 00:09:52.225
Everybody out!

92

Come on! Quickly now.

93

Gather around.
Come on, everybody.


94
00:09:58.899 --> 00:10:02.235
Come out quickly.
We haven't got all day.


95

Now, I want you to listen to me.
- What is it?


96
00:10:04.405 --> 00:10:06.489
(woman): I got a few things
I have to tell you.


97
00:10:06.616 --> 00:10:08.617
- Just the way Dolores gets so excited
with the kids.


98
00:10:08.743 --> 00:10:11.536
- Alright. Rule number 1.
- It's like the biggest thing in her life.


99
00:10:11.662 --> 00:10:13.955
- Don't stick your fingers
into any of the cages.


100
00:10:14.081 --> 00:10:18.001
Heidi, this applies to you.
And Shane, get back here, please.


101
00:10:18.294 --> 00:10:20.629
I don't care how cute
some of these animals may be,


102
00:10:20.755 --> 00:10:22.839
the fact is
they don't like being here.


103
00:10:23.049 --> 00:10:25.884
No matter how many ribbons
they may have won. Eh?


104

(indistinct chatter)

105
00:10:27.553 --> 00:10:29.471
Rule number 2.
Hey, Sam.


106
00:10:29.597 --> 00:10:33.141
Hey, Nicole.
Rule number 2: no kicking,


107
00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:35.560
pushing, shoving or biting.

108
00:10:35.728 --> 00:10:38.563
Rule number 3: older kids,
you look after the younger kids.


109
00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:42.567
If any of you get lost, you come here
to the red lady. I will find you.


110

(toilet flushing)

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.258
- Is it raining outside?

118
00:11:48.342 --> 00:11:51.010
- No, uh... had an accident.

119
00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:53.179
Do you have a room?

120
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.685
- Will you be spending
more than a night?


121
00:11:58.853 --> 00:12:00.770
- Hard to say. Uh...

122
00:12:00.855 --> 00:12:03.356
Could have some business here-
- You a reporter?


123
00:12:10.656 --> 00:12:12.240
- No, sir.

124

- You here about the accident?

125
00:12:18.622 --> 00:12:20.498
- Yes.

126
00:12:20.624 --> 00:12:22.584
I'm a lawyer.

127
00:12:24.003 --> 00:12:27.046
I realize this is an awful time,
but it's important that we talk.


128
00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:31.426
- Kyle Lansdom's a drunk.

129
00:12:31.552 --> 00:12:33.428
Nobody likes him.

130
00:12:33.554 --> 00:12:36.598
He's a nasty piece of work.
- In what way?


131
00:12:36.724 --> 00:12:40.226
- Well, he's been drinking since high school.
Fucked himself up.


132
00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:42.896
Used to be smart enough.

133
00:12:43.022 --> 00:12:44.606
- Any criminal record?

134
00:12:44.732 --> 00:12:49.986
- Probably... at least half a dozen
traffic convictions, drunk driving.


135
00:12:50.112 --> 00:12:52.906
Lost his licence.
That's why he don't work no more.


136
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:58.286
Can't get off that... shitty dump
they live on.


137
00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:02.248
Whatever money does come in
goes to booze.


138
00:13:02.374 --> 00:13:04.584
- How does the family survive?

139
00:13:06.253 --> 00:13:07.587
- I dunno.

140
00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:09.589
Church charity...

141
00:13:09.715 --> 00:13:12.759
Welfare, food bank.
They scrape by.

- And, uh...

145
00:13:20.726 --> 00:13:23.102
What about Dora?
(woman): Doreen.


146
00:13:23.687 --> 00:13:26.231
She was a friend of mine.

147
00:13:27.316 --> 00:13:29.651
- When was that?
- At school.


148
00:13:32.655 --> 00:13:35.782
She fell for Kyle
just before we graduated.


149
00:13:37.618 --> 00:13:39.536
And... she got pregnant.

150
00:13:40.746 --> 00:13:43.581
Uh... moved into a... a trailer,

151
00:13:43.666 --> 00:13:46.918
up... on a wood lot
Kyle's dad used to own.


152
00:13:47.002 --> 00:13:50.630
Kyle started spending more and more time
at the Spread Eagle.


153
00:13:50.756 --> 00:13:52.674
- That's the local bar?

154
00:13:55.594 --> 00:13:58.847
- Uh... and coming home drunk,
and...


155
00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:03.685
feeling trapped by his life,
I guess, and...


156
00:14:04.728 --> 00:14:07.188
blaming her for that and...

157
00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:10.024
Well.
- And...?


158
00:14:10.276 --> 00:14:12.610
And... and...

159
00:14:12.945 --> 00:14:14.487
and he beat her.

160
00:14:15.531 --> 00:14:17.991
- He beat her?
(man): Yes!


161
00:14:18.117 --> 00:14:19.325
- Oh...

162
00:14:19.869 --> 00:14:23.496
You see... to do this right,

163
00:14:23.622 --> 00:14:25.206
to actually have a chance
of winning,


164
00:14:25.332 --> 00:14:28.668
of getting some money to compensate you
for the loss of your boy,


165
00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:33.298
we need folks like you.

166
00:14:33.465 --> 00:14:36.050
Sensitive, loving parents,

167
00:14:36.176 --> 00:14:38.970
with no criminal background,
no history of trouble in the town.


168
00:14:39.096 --> 00:14:42.265
Do you understand?
- Yes.


169
00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:45.393
- Now, of these people
that you've told me about


170
00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:48.438
whose kids were killed,

171
00:14:48.564 --> 00:14:51.733
who do you consider to be good,
upstanding neighbours?


172
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.528
People who will help us
in our cause?


173
00:14:55.654 --> 00:14:59.282
- Uh, there's the Hamiltons.
Joe and Shelly Hamilton.


174
00:14:59.408 --> 00:15:01.326
(man): Oh yeah, right!

175
00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:02.827
(scoffing)

176
00:15:04.997 --> 00:15:08.124
Everybody knows that Joey

177
00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.085
steals antiques from summer cottages

178
00:15:11.253 --> 00:15:13.504
and sells them to dealers
in the city.


179
00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:16.341
He's been doing that for years.
- That's great, Wendell.


180
00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:19.093
That's exactly what I need to know.

181
00:15:19.261 --> 00:15:21.471
You see, so it won't come back
to haunt our case later on-


182
00:15:21.597 --> 00:15:23.806
(woman): There's the Prescotts.

183
00:15:23.933 --> 00:15:27.101
- Oh! You know how much money
he owes to the bank?


184
00:15:27.227 --> 00:15:28.645
He's about to lose his house,

185
00:15:28.771 --> 00:15:30.688
he's about to lose his car.
- Yeah.


186
00:15:30.814 --> 00:15:31.731
But Charlene, she-

187
00:15:31.857 --> 00:15:35.026
- Charlene is over at the Spread Eagle
every other night.


188
00:15:35.152 --> 00:15:38.488
She sleeps with whoever
she can get her hands on.


189
00:15:38.656 --> 00:15:40.281
I mean, she'd go down for a...

190
00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:42.575
pat on the head
and a fistful of peanuts.


191
00:15:42.701 --> 00:15:44.160
- Ah... Ahem!

192
00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:54.003
- Forget the Atwaters and the Biladows.
They're all inbred.


193
00:15:54.838 --> 00:15:55.880
- Oh.

194
00:15:56.006 --> 00:15:58.341
(woman): The Ottos.
- The...


195
00:16:02.513 --> 00:16:04.681
- Well, tell me about the Ottos.

196
00:16:04.765 --> 00:16:07.350
- Wanda and Hartley.

197
00:16:07.518 --> 00:16:09.852
They lost Bear.

198
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.188
He was their adopted son.

199
00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:17.527
He was a beautiful boy.
He was Indian.


200
00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:21.531
- That's good.
Judges like adopted Indian boys.


201
00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:24.242
Tell me more about the Ottos.
- They're smart.


202
00:16:25.703 --> 00:16:27.453
They've been to college.

203
00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:30.331
They moved here from the city
about a dozen years ago.


204
00:16:30.457 --> 00:16:31.916
(man): What do they do?

205
00:16:32.042 --> 00:16:34.669
- Crafts.
(Wendell scoffing)


206
00:16:34.795 --> 00:16:35.920
(man scribbling)

207
00:16:36.046 --> 00:16:37.964
Wanda does these photographic things.

208
00:16:38.173 --> 00:16:41.968
That's one of hers.
Right here on the wall.


209
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.222
- You know, they probably smoke weed.
- You don't know that.


210
00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:48.224
- They ever been busted?

211
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.226
- No.
- You don't know!


212
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.895
That's what it is.
You don't know.


213
00:16:54.857 --> 00:16:56.816
(cellphone ringing)

214
00:16:58.736 --> 00:17:00.695
(ringing)
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.


215
00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:02.780
(sighing): Yes?

216
00:17:02.906 --> 00:17:04.741
<i>(woman): Collect call from Zoe.
Will you accept the charges?</i>


217
00:17:04.867 --> 00:17:06.492
- Yes, I'll accept the charges.

218
00:17:06.618 --> 00:17:08.411
Do you mind if I step outside
for a moment?


219
00:17:08.537 --> 00:17:10.747
It's a private call.
I'm so sorry.


220
00:17:12.416 --> 00:17:14.167
(sighing)

221
00:17:15.127 --> 00:17:17.086
- Why do you say things
when you don't know...


222
00:17:17.212 --> 00:17:19.756
- Zoe? Where are you, darling?
(Wendell): Shut up.


223
00:17:19.882 --> 00:17:21.340
(woman): I won't shut up.
- Yeah...


224
00:17:21.467 --> 00:17:23.426
(indistinct comment)
(Wendell): Oh, shut up.


225
00:17:23.552 --> 00:17:25.470
- Yeah...
(Wendell): Shut up!


226
00:17:25.596 --> 00:17:28.473
- Yes, I am listening...
(Wendell): Shut your big, fat mouth.


227
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.478
- Oh... no, of course I'm being sincere.
I understand what you're saying.


228
00:17:33.604 --> 00:17:34.937
The fact that you...
(shouting)


229
00:17:35.064 --> 00:17:37.899
The fact that you like the doctor,
I mean... it's half the battle...


230
00:17:38.025 --> 00:17:39.567
(Wendell): Shut up.
(woman): You're jealous again.


231
00:17:39.693 --> 00:17:41.736
- Please...
(Wendell): Shut up. I'm jealous of what?


232
00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:44.197
What am I jealous of?
(woman): 'Cause he's smarter than you.


233
00:17:44.323 --> 00:17:45.573
- Yeah...
(Wendell): Smarter than me?


234
00:17:45.699 --> 00:17:48.117
Oh, yeah!
Like the Ottos are smart, too.


235
00:17:48.243 --> 00:17:50.161
Did you hear what that man said?
He said, "Good, Wendell."


236
00:17:50.287 --> 00:17:52.371
Good! He said, "Good!"
- I will do it in 10 minutes.


237
00:17:52.498 --> 00:17:54.457
(woman): You're a big baby!
(Wendell): Shut up!

- Yes, sir?
- Oh, hi.


244
00:18:23.445 --> 00:18:25.321
I... I can't get
any sound of out this.

245
00:18:25.447 --> 00:18:27.365
- Oh, here. I'll get you another pair.
- Thank you.


246
00:18:30.536 --> 00:18:32.537
- Here, you can have mine.

247
00:18:35.165 --> 00:18:38.126
Allison O'Donnell.
- Alli...


248
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.128
- I was a friend of Zoe's.

249
00:18:40.212 --> 00:18:43.131
We used to go to school together.
I used to come to your house.


250
00:18:43.215 --> 00:18:46.717
- Yeah...
- Ally. Îœy nickname was Ally.


251
00:18:46.844 --> 00:18:49.345
- Ally? Right, right.

252
00:18:49.972 --> 00:18:51.347
- How are you?

253
00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:53.349
- Oh, I'm just fine.

254
00:18:53.475 --> 00:18:55.560
How about you?
- I'm fine.


255
00:18:55.686 --> 00:18:59.188
I'm... still working with my father.
- Right.


256
00:18:59.314 --> 00:19:01.190
Um...

257
00:19:01.358 --> 00:19:03.526
What does he do again?

258
00:19:03.694 --> 00:19:06.237
- Well, he used to work with you.
You guys used to be partners.


259
00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:08.239
(both chuckling)

260
00:19:08.365 --> 00:19:10.658
- Allison!
- Îœm-hmm.


261
00:19:10.784 --> 00:19:12.660
How's Îœrs. Stevens?

262
00:19:12.786 --> 00:19:16.289
- Well, she's just fine. She...
We're... not together anymore.


263
00:19:16.415 --> 00:19:18.708
- Yeah, I'd heard that. But she's well?
- Yeah.


264
00:19:18.834 --> 00:19:20.710
- And Zoe?

265
00:19:20.836 --> 00:19:22.545
How's Zoe?

266

Hey, Hartley!


274

(Wanda): Hi, Dolores.
(Hartley): Good morning, Dolores.


275
00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.549
Beautiful snow we're having,
eh, Dolores?


276
00:20:08.717 --> 00:20:11.594
- Oh, it's just a flurry, Hartley.
It's totally clear up ahead.

- That's good.

- What do you think?


279
00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:19.560
(Dolores): Well, it's, uh...
certainly what you call interesting.


280
00:20:20.604 --> 00:20:21.938
- You hate it.

281
00:20:22.272 --> 00:20:25.066

- No. No, no. I didn't say that. No.


282
00:20:25.192 --> 00:20:27.944
(Wanda): I could wrap it up
to protect the children.


283
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.570
- I can just strap
up on the roof, eh?

284
00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:31.739
(Hartley): There's an idea!
- Come on, give me a break!


285
00:20:31.865 --> 00:20:33.783
It's for the school bazaar.

286

- Oh, well, it's bizarre alright.
(laughing)


287

Come on, Bear.
Let's get you outta here.


288
00:20:37.871 --> 00:20:40.623
- Come on, Bear.
Away from your crazy mother.


289
00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:43.626
- That's right. I'll see you, Wanda.
Bye, Hartley.

- Yes.

(distant barking)

313
00:22:06.209 --> 00:22:08.544
They're regular at town meetings.

314
00:22:08.712 --> 00:22:11.380
They, uh... give their opinion

315
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.383
in a respectful way.

316
00:22:14.551 --> 00:22:16.385
And they, uh...

317
00:22:16.553 --> 00:22:20.806
they help out at various...
(Dolores inhaling)


318
00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:23.351
...fundraising bazaars,

319
00:22:23.477 --> 00:22:24.769
though they aren't...

320
00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:29.732
Uh...
(Dolores gulping)


321
00:22:31.401 --> 00:22:33.903
...church goers.

322
00:22:34.196 --> 00:22:36.572
- Îœm...

323
00:22:36.656 --> 00:22:39.408
And they love Bear?
(Dolores): Oh... yes.


324
00:22:40.452 --> 00:22:42.578
It's... it's like
he's their little treasure.


325
00:22:42.662 --> 00:22:45.247
He's such a beautiful boy...

326
00:22:45.332 --> 00:22:48.209
Oh, well, there's a picture of him
on the wall over there,


327
00:22:48.335 --> 00:22:49.543
just beside Abbott.

328
00:22:50.587 --> 00:22:52.088
(distant barking)

329
00:22:56.259 --> 00:22:59.261
Those were all taken at the fair
last year.


330
00:22:59.346 --> 00:23:01.806
Abbott and me, we were judges
at the pet show.


331
00:23:01.932 --> 00:23:03.307
- For rabbits?
(Abbott mumbling)


332
00:23:03.433 --> 00:23:06.394
- Abbott used to breed them
till he had the stroke.


333
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.105
(Abbott mumbling)
Bear won 1 st prize.


334
00:23:09.231 --> 00:23:11.607
Just look at the smile on his face.

335
00:23:13.568 --> 00:23:16.987
He's one of those children who...
who bring out the best in people.


336
00:23:19.783 --> 00:23:21.409
(distant barking)

337
00:23:23.537 --> 00:23:25.788
He would've made a wonderful man.

338
00:23:34.714 --> 00:23:37.174
(music): Watch the band

339
00:23:39.219 --> 00:23:42.972
<i>Through a bunch of dancers</i>

340
00:23:45.058 --> 00:23:48.060
<i>Quickly</i>

341
00:23:49.479 --> 00:23:53.065
<i>Follow the unknown</i>

342
00:23:55.485 --> 00:23:58.487
<i>With something</i>

343
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.909
<i>More familiar</i>

344
00:24:06.288 --> 00:24:08.914
<i>Quickly</i>

345
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.211
<i>Something familiar</i>

346
00:24:17.924 --> 00:24:19.425
<i>Courage...</i>

347
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:22.511
<i>(Dolores): Billy Ansel
started honking at us</i>


348
00:24:22.637 --> 00:24:24.513
<i>up around Upperhat Creek.</i>

349
00:24:24.639 --> 00:24:26.891
<i>(honking)
He always started to do that</i>


350
00:24:27.184 --> 00:24:28.893
<i>when he caught up to the bus.</i>

351
00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:32.563
<i>He'd wave at his kids,
Jessica and Mason.</i>


352
00:24:32.689 --> 00:24:35.566
<i>They... always sat in the back.</i>

353
00:24:36.693 --> 00:24:39.236
<i>Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.
(honking)</i>


354
00:24:41.198 --> 00:24:44.158
<i>Normally, he'd follow us
the whole distance</i>


355
00:24:44.242 --> 00:24:47.161
<i>past the bridge,
towards the school.</i>


356
00:24:47.245 --> 00:24:50.539
<i>(Stevens): Are you saying that Billy
was driving behind the bus</i>


357
00:24:50.665 --> 00:24:53.667
<i>at the time of the accident?
(Dolores): Yeah.</i>


358
00:24:53.752 --> 00:24:55.586
It...

359
00:24:57.672 --> 00:25:01.550
uh... comforted him.
- From what?


360
00:25:01.718 --> 00:25:04.887
- From what?
(distant barking)


361
00:25:05.013 --> 00:25:07.097
- I'll get the tray.
- Oh, thank you.


362
00:25:07.224 --> 00:25:10.518
- Did he have any, uh...
particular problems that you knew of?


363
00:25:10.644 --> 00:25:13.521
Financial pressures,
run-ins with the law that...


364
00:25:13.647 --> 00:25:15.523
You go ahead.
- No!


365
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:17.942
No, no, no.

366
00:25:18.568 --> 00:25:20.402
No. No, no, no.

367
00:25:20.529 --> 00:25:22.488
Nothing like that.

368
00:25:22.614 --> 00:25:24.573
No.
(distant barking)


369
00:25:25.116 --> 00:25:29.119
Billy's wife, Lydia -
God rest her -


370
00:25:29.246 --> 00:25:33.123
she died of cancer
a few years back.


371
00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.125
Ah... she was a wonderful woman.

372
00:25:35.252 --> 00:25:37.586
Great mom.
(TV playing)


373
00:25:37.712 --> 00:25:41.131
Warm, lovin'.

374
00:25:41.258 --> 00:25:43.133
She had a beautiful voice.

375
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.221
She used to sing in the...
church choir.


376
00:25:48.098 --> 00:25:49.056
(softly grunting)

377
00:25:49.182 --> 00:25:51.225
Anyway.

378
00:25:51.977 --> 00:25:54.103
(grunting)

379
00:25:54.229 --> 00:25:57.106
Billy took over raising the kids
by himself.


380
00:25:58.608 --> 00:26:00.734
It was obvious
how much he missed Lydia.


381
00:26:06.199 --> 00:26:07.950
(dialing)

382
00:26:10.412 --> 00:26:12.621
(phone ringing)

383
00:26:13.623 --> 00:26:15.457
(ringing)
- Hello?


384
00:26:15.625 --> 00:26:17.376
(Billy): Hey, Risa.
- Hi.


385
00:26:17.502 --> 00:26:19.128
<i>
- Can you talk?</i>

386
00:26:19.296 --> 00:26:22.006
- Uh, yeah. Where are ya?

387
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.009
<i>- I was on my way to work.
- Do you see the kids?</i>


388
00:26:25.135 --> 00:26:27.011
- Yeah, I'm wavin' at 'em right now.

389
00:26:27.137 --> 00:26:29.471
<i>(clanging)
What's that noise?</i>


390
00:26:29.598 --> 00:26:32.474
- It's Wendell. He's up on the roof.
He thinks he's fixing a leak.


391
00:26:32.642 --> 00:26:36.145
Ha! Ha! As far as I'm concerned,
he's just punching in a few new holes.


392
00:26:36.271 --> 00:26:39.231
(laughing)
- Hey, listen.


393
00:26:39.357 --> 00:26:42.234
Nicole's comin' over to look after the kids
tonight. She'll be there at around 6.


394
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.487
<i>- Oh, Billy, that's too early.
- She says she's gotta be home by 9, so...</i>


395
00:26:45.655 --> 00:26:48.574
<i>- Yeah, can't you make it later?
- Well, alright, well...</i>


396
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.161
Well, just... I'll be waitin' in the room
and, uh...


397
00:26:52.329 --> 00:26:54.288
you just get over
as soon as you can, okay?


398
00:26:54.414 --> 00:26:56.790
- Okay, I guess.

399
00:26:57.626 --> 00:26:59.710
- Alright, sexy.

400
00:26:59.836 --> 00:27:01.295
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>


401
00:27:04.215 --> 00:27:05.549
(soft music)

402
00:27:23.526 --> 00:27:25.527
- Thanks.

403
00:27:26.738 --> 00:27:28.030
- Îœm-hmm.

404
00:27:30.533 --> 00:27:33.118
- I'm glad to hear
that Zoe's alright.


405
00:27:33.203 --> 00:27:35.120
(woman): You're welcome.

406
00:27:35.205 --> 00:27:37.539
- Are you still in touch?

407
00:27:37.707 --> 00:27:40.125
- Not really.

408
00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.378
The last time I saw her

409
00:27:42.545 --> 00:27:45.547
was when she was at that clinic;
that was a long time ago.


410
00:27:45.632 --> 00:27:48.384
- Which one?
- Which one?


411
00:27:48.468 --> 00:27:50.552
- Which clinic?

412
00:27:52.555 --> 00:27:56.725
- I don't remember the name.
It was... near a beach.


413
00:27:56.851 --> 00:27:58.519
(background chatter)

414
00:27:58.645 --> 00:28:00.562
- Sunny Ridge...

415
00:28:03.191 --> 00:28:05.526
Yes, that was a long time ago.

416
00:28:06.444 --> 00:28:08.237
(plane motor humming)

417
00:28:08.363 --> 00:28:10.072
- So there were others?

418
00:28:10.198 --> 00:28:12.157
- Other clinics? Oh, sure.

419
00:28:14.119 --> 00:28:17.538
Clinics, halfway houses,
treatment centres, detox units...


420
00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:22.459
- So when did she get better?

421
00:28:22.585 --> 00:28:25.170
(inhaling): She... didn't.

422
00:28:27.132 --> 00:28:29.133
- Oh, I thought you said-
- That's why I'm going to see her now.


423
00:28:31.469 --> 00:28:34.054
- She's in trouble?

424
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.764
(utensils clattering)

425
00:28:36.516 --> 00:28:40.894
- Yes. You find there's...
something strange about this meat?


426
00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.480
Uh, excuse me.
- Some more wine?


427
00:28:43.606 --> 00:28:46.108
- No, I think this meat's
a little overdone for me.


428
00:28:46.234 --> 00:28:48.485
- Oh, I'm sorry, Îœr. Stevens.
Would you like to try the fish plate?


429
00:28:48.611 --> 00:28:51.155
- What is it?
- Poached salmon.


430
00:28:51.281 --> 00:28:53.615
- Do-do you have a cold plate?
- We do.


431
00:28:53.783 --> 00:28:55.159
- Is there shrimp on it?
- Yes.


432
00:28:55.285 --> 00:28:57.244
- Well, if you take the shrimp off,

433
00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.955
as well as anything else
that touches the shrimp, I'd be grateful.


434
00:29:00.081 --> 00:29:02.499
- I'm not sure that's gonna leave much
on the plate.


435
00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:04.460
- Well, let's just see what we get,
shall we?


436
00:29:04.586 --> 00:29:06.253
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.


437
00:29:06.379 --> 00:29:08.005
Will you excuse me a minute?

438
00:29:08.131 --> 00:29:10.591
- Îœm.
(utensils clattering)


439
00:29:18.224 --> 00:29:20.350
(soft medieval music)

440
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.701
(birds chirping)

441
00:29:46.377 --> 00:29:56.377
(cawing)

442
00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:38.670
(knocking)

443
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.560
- Îœrs. Otto?

444
00:30:44.644 --> 00:30:46.728
Îœy name is Îœitchell Stevens.
The Walkers told me


445
00:30:46.855 --> 00:30:48.856
that you might be willing
to talk to me.


446
00:30:48.982 --> 00:30:52.609
I'm really sorry to come over
unannounced like this.


447
00:30:52.735 --> 00:30:54.611
But the Walkers said
that you'd understand.


448
00:30:56.114 --> 00:30:57.698
I know it's an awful time...

449
00:30:57.782 --> 00:31:00.617
but it is important
that we talk.


450
00:31:02.036 --> 00:31:03.453
- Who are you?

451
00:31:03.621 --> 00:31:06.123
- I'm a lawyer.

452
00:31:06.374 --> 00:31:08.542
- Oh... look, I'm sorry.
You can't come in here.


453
00:31:08.668 --> 00:31:10.544
- Please, let me explain.

454
00:31:10.879 --> 00:31:13.297
I- I'll only take a moment
of your time.


455
00:31:13.423 --> 00:31:15.382
Please.

456
00:31:25.602 --> 00:31:27.477
(soft medieval music)

457
00:31:33.568 --> 00:31:35.611
(Wanda): Hartley...

458
00:31:38.197 --> 00:31:40.240
We have a guest.

459
00:31:45.204 --> 00:31:48.624
What did you say your name was?
- Uh, Îœitchell Stevens.


460
00:31:55.673 --> 00:31:58.133
- The Walkers sent him by.

461
00:32:17.528 --> 00:32:20.197
- Would you like a cup of tea
or something?


462
00:32:22.158 --> 00:32:24.201
- A cup of tea would be nice.

463
00:32:36.214 --> 00:32:38.048
(kettle whistling)

464
00:32:46.182 --> 00:32:48.558
Alright if sit down
for a few minutes, Îœrs. Otto?


465
00:32:48.685 --> 00:32:50.352
I wanna talk to you.

466
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.608
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.

467
00:32:56.734 --> 00:32:58.694
- You've been retained?

468
00:33:00.571 --> 00:33:02.114
- Yes.

469
00:33:03.282 --> 00:33:05.534
- Their child died
and they got a lawyer?


470
00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.954
- It should be said that my task
is to represent the Walkers


471
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.540
only in their anger,
not their grief.


472
00:33:11.916 --> 00:33:13.542
- Who did they get for that?!

473
00:33:15.962 --> 00:33:17.629
- You're angry, aren't you,
Îœrs. Otto?


474
00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.551
That's why I'm here.

475
00:33:22.635 --> 00:33:25.137
To give your anger a voice.

476
00:33:26.097 --> 00:33:31.143
To be your weapon against whoever...
caused that bus to go off the road.


477
00:33:31.227 --> 00:33:33.145
- Dolores?

478
00:33:33.438 --> 00:33:37.190
- It's my belief that Dolores was doing
exactly what she's done for years.


479
00:33:38.234 --> 00:33:41.153
Besides, the school board's insurance
on Dolores was minimal:


480
00:33:41.237 --> 00:33:44.156
a few million at most.

481
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.575
No, the really deep pockets
are in the town.


482
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:49.161
Or the company that made the bus.

483
00:33:49.245 --> 00:33:52.164
- So you think someone else
caused the accident, Îœr. Stevens?


484
00:33:52.248 --> 00:33:56.334
- Îœrs. Otto, there is no such thing
as an accident.


485
00:33:58.671 --> 00:34:00.547
The word doesn't mean anything to me.

486
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.550
As far as I'm concerned,

487
00:34:03.676 --> 00:34:06.303
somebody, somewhere...

488
00:34:06.429 --> 00:34:08.930
made a decision to cut a corner.

489
00:34:09.223 --> 00:34:12.684
Some corrupt agency or corporation

490
00:34:13.686 --> 00:34:17.147
accounted the cost variance
between a 10-cent bolt


491
00:34:17.398 --> 00:34:20.567
and a million-dollar
out-of-court settlement.


492
00:34:24.155 --> 00:34:28.617
And they decided to sacrifice
a few lives for the difference.


493
00:34:28.743 --> 00:34:31.119
That's what's done, Îœrs. Otto.

494
00:34:31.245 --> 00:34:34.247
I've seen it happen
so many times before.


495
00:34:34.499 --> 00:34:35.999
(Hartley): But Dolores said...

496
00:34:36.334 --> 00:34:38.126
she hit a patch of ice,

497
00:34:38.252 --> 00:34:40.504
and lost control of the bus.

498
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.507
- Yeah... Îœr. Otto, how long has Dolores
been driving that bus?


499
00:34:43.633 --> 00:34:46.134
How many times
has she steered clear of danger?


500
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.929
I mean, what happened that morning?

501
00:34:49.055 --> 00:34:50.639
Thank you.

502
00:34:55.186 --> 00:35:00.232
Somebody calculated ahead of time
what it would cost to sacrifice safety.


503
00:35:00.358 --> 00:35:04.152
It's... the darkest, most cynical thing
you could imagine,


504
00:35:04.278 --> 00:35:07.114
but it's absolutely true.

505
00:35:07.198 --> 00:35:09.116
And now,

506
00:35:10.034 --> 00:35:14.621
it's up to me to ensure
moral responsibility in this society.


507
00:35:14.914 --> 00:35:16.998
- So you're just the thing we need.

508
00:35:18.793 --> 00:35:22.504
Isn't that you want us
to believe, Îœr. Stevens?


509
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.841
That you know what's best for us?

510
00:35:26.801 --> 00:35:28.093
- Ahem...

511
00:35:32.557 --> 00:35:35.642
Now, you listen to me, Îœrs. Otto.

512
00:35:38.187 --> 00:35:40.230
And you listen very carefully.

513
00:35:42.191 --> 00:35:45.152
I do know what's best,
believe me.


514
00:35:45.236 --> 00:35:47.154
As we're sitting here, talking,

515
00:35:48.614 --> 00:35:52.159
the town...
or the school board


516
00:35:52.243 --> 00:35:55.203
or the manufacturer of that bus

517
00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:58.665
are lining up a battery
of their own lawyers


518
00:35:58.708 --> 00:36:02.169
to negotiate with people
as grief-stricken as yourselves.


519
00:36:02.253 --> 00:36:04.880
And that makes me very, very mad.

520
00:36:05.006 --> 00:36:08.508
That's why I came
all the way up here.


521
00:36:08.634 --> 00:36:11.761
If everyone had done their job
with integrity,


522
00:36:11.888 --> 00:36:13.763
your son would be alive

523
00:36:14.098 --> 00:36:15.849
and safely in school this morning.

524
00:36:16.642 --> 00:36:17.976
(sobbing)

525
00:36:18.102 --> 00:36:22.856
I promise... that I will pursue
and reveal


526
00:36:22.982 --> 00:36:26.651
who it was
did not do their job.


527
00:36:26.777 --> 00:36:27.986
(Wanda sobbing)

528
00:36:28.112 --> 00:36:30.530
Who is responsible for this...

529
00:36:31.282 --> 00:36:32.741
tragedy.

530
00:36:34.702 --> 00:36:37.370
And then, in your name,
the Walkers' name,


531
00:36:37.496 --> 00:36:40.207
in-in the name
of whoever decides to join us,


532
00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:43.168
I will sue...

533
00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:47.923
I will sue for negligence
until they bleed.


534
00:36:48.049 --> 00:36:50.926
- I want that...
that person to go to jail...


535
00:36:51.052 --> 00:36:53.553
for the rest of his life.

536
00:36:53.638 --> 00:36:56.223
(sobbing)
I want him...


537
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:59.476
I want him... to die there.

538
00:37:01.395 --> 00:37:03.521
I don't want his money.

539
00:37:04.899 --> 00:37:07.442
- It's unlikely that anyone
will go to prison, Îœrs. Otto.


540
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:12.197
But he or his company
will pay in other ways.


541
00:37:13.282 --> 00:37:15.450
And we must make them pay.

542
00:37:15.618 --> 00:37:18.703
Not for the money or the... compensation
for the loss of your boy.


543
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:20.038
That can't be done.

544
00:37:20.873 --> 00:37:23.333
(Wanda sobbing)
(fire crackling)


545
00:37:23.459 --> 00:37:25.961
But for the protection
of other innocent children.


546
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:33.134
You see, I'm not just here
to speak for your anger...


547
00:37:33.344 --> 00:37:35.804
but for the future as well.

548
00:37:44.146 --> 00:37:46.648
- Are you expensive?

549
00:37:51.529 --> 00:37:53.196
- No.

550
00:37:55.658 --> 00:37:59.160
If you agree to have me
represent you in this suit,


551
00:37:59.245 --> 00:38:02.539
I will require no payment
until the case is won,


552
00:38:02.665 --> 00:38:06.835
when I will require one third
of the awarded amount.


553
00:38:07.211 --> 00:38:09.504
If no award is made,

554
00:38:09.588 --> 00:38:13.091
then my services to you
will cost you absolutely nothing.


555
00:38:13.175 --> 00:38:15.093
This is... standard agreement.

556
00:38:15.177 --> 00:38:17.178
- Do you have this agreement with you?

557
00:38:17.388 --> 00:38:20.515
- Yes, I do. It's in my car.

558
00:38:24.395 --> 00:38:26.354
I won't be a minute.

559
00:38:26.439 --> 00:38:28.440
Uh... in any case,

560
00:38:28.524 --> 00:38:32.319
you should have time to discuss this
without me before you make a decision.


561
00:38:35.406 --> 00:38:37.449
(soft oriental music)

562
00:38:46.542 --> 00:38:48.793
<i>(Stevens): I did everything a loving father</i>

563
00:38:48.878 --> 00:38:50.879
<i>of a drug addict is supposed to do.</i>

564
00:38:51.047 --> 00:38:53.048
<i>I sent her to the best hospitals.</i>

565
00:38:53.174 --> 00:38:55.008
She saw the best doctors.

566
00:38:55.134 --> 00:38:57.552
No matter, two weeks later,
she'd be out on the street.


567
00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.512
And next time I saw her,

568
00:38:59.638 --> 00:39:03.516
a phone call
is coming for money.


569
00:39:03.642 --> 00:39:05.435
Îœoney for school,
money for some new kind of therapist.


570
00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:07.645
Or... money for a plane ticket home.

571
00:39:07.772 --> 00:39:11.441
"Oh, Daddy, please,
let me come home. I need to see you."


572
00:39:11.567 --> 00:39:13.443
But she never came home.

573
00:39:13.569 --> 00:39:17.155
I was always at the airport,
but she was never there.


574
00:39:19.033 --> 00:39:20.367
(sipping, gulping)

575
00:39:20.493 --> 00:39:24.079
Had 10 years of this.

576
00:39:24.205 --> 00:39:27.457
I wondered what would happen
if I didn't send the money.


577
00:39:27.583 --> 00:39:30.335
Kicking down doors...

578
00:39:30.461 --> 00:39:34.881
dragging her out
of rat-infested apartments.


579
00:39:35.007 --> 00:39:37.926
Explaining to somebody
that couldn't possibly be my daughter


580
00:39:38.052 --> 00:39:40.470
that they saw in a porn flick!

581
00:39:41.597 --> 00:39:43.181
Oh...

582
00:39:46.519 --> 00:39:50.563
Enough rage and helplessness
and your love turns to something else.


583
00:39:54.527 --> 00:39:56.569
- What does it turn to?

584
00:40:01.534 --> 00:40:03.576
- It turns to steaming piss.

585
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:10.583
- Hello!

586
00:40:11.627 --> 00:40:13.753
(children shouting)

587
00:40:16.173 --> 00:40:18.133
- Hi, Nicole.
- Hi.


588
00:40:18.259 --> 00:40:18.842
- They just had supper. Okay?

589
00:40:18.968 --> 00:40:22.137
- Yeah? Was it good?
- Alright, you be good.


590
00:40:22.263 --> 00:40:24.139
- Yuk!
- Was it good? Of course it was good.


591
00:40:24.265 --> 00:40:25.932
I'll be back before 9, okay?

592
00:40:26.058 --> 00:40:27.559
- Okay. That's good. Bye!
- Bye.


593
00:40:27.685 --> 00:40:29.602
- Oh...
- Let's go!


594
00:40:32.773 --> 00:40:34.941
(electric guitar)

595
00:40:57.214 --> 00:40:59.174
(distant train)

596
00:41:32.708 --> 00:41:34.334
(vehicle passing by)

597
00:41:37.129 --> 00:41:38.630
(sighing)

598
00:41:41.425 --> 00:41:43.551
- Hey.

599
00:41:43.677 --> 00:41:45.553
- Are you waiting long?

600
00:41:45.679 --> 00:41:49.057
- A while.
- Billy, do you have to smoke?


601
00:41:49.183 --> 00:41:51.267
Wendell can smell it
if someone's been smoking.


602
00:41:58.692 --> 00:42:00.193
- What's all this?

603
00:42:00.277 --> 00:42:03.446
- Wendell put some fresh enamel
on that break in the tub.


604
00:42:03.572 --> 00:42:06.115
- Does it mean
I can't have a shower?

605
00:42:06.242 --> 00:42:08.535
- No, should be dry by now.

606
00:42:08.661 --> 00:42:11.538
(laughter)

607
00:42:11.664 --> 00:42:13.540
- When's he getting back?

608
00:42:13.666 --> 00:42:15.542
- After the game, I guess.

609
00:42:15.668 --> 00:42:17.585
- Oh, the game.

610
00:42:20.548 --> 00:42:22.590
- Oh! Hey!
(TV playing)


611
00:42:28.055 --> 00:42:31.432
(Nicole): The Pied Piper of Hamelin.

612
00:42:31.559 --> 00:42:35.436
"Hamelin town's in Brunswick,
by famous Hanover city.


613
00:42:35.646 --> 00:42:40.400
"The river Weser, deep and wide,
washes its wall on the southern side.


614
00:42:40.526 --> 00:42:43.152
"A pleasanter spot you never spied.

615
00:42:43.279 --> 00:42:46.155
"But when begins my ditty-"
- What's a ditty again?


616
00:42:46.282 --> 00:42:49.576
- Um, it's a... it's like a song.
- Oh.


617
00:42:49.702 --> 00:42:51.911
- "Almost 500 years ago,

618

"to see the townsfolk suffer so
from vermin was a pity."


619
00:42:55.207 --> 00:42:56.624
- What's vermin again?

620
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.543
- Rats.
- Oh.


621
00:42:58.669 --> 00:43:00.545
- Um! "They fought the dogs
and killed the cats,


622
00:43:00.671 --> 00:43:02.547
"and bit the babies in the cradles,

"and ate the cheeses

- Your kids never cry?

675

I'll be following 'em

kind of... weird.

691

- Why?
- I dunno.

(sighing)
- Listen, Nicole.


693
00:47:05.123 --> 00:47:07.333
You know, I'm just gonna take this stuff
and pack it,

- No.

No, I... I mean, I...

698

some of this stuff, but... um...


699
00:47:21.306 --> 00:47:23.057
I don't feel weird about that.
- Okay.


700

- I really liked her.

701

- Well, she really liked you.

702
00:47:30.774 --> 00:47:33.943
And I think she probably
would've given you that stuff herself


703
00:47:34.278 --> 00:47:36.195
if she hadn't outgrown it or...

704
00:47:38.824 --> 00:47:40.992
- What do you mean,
out... out grown it?

00:53:07.527 --> 00:53:10.112
- 'Îœorning, Dolores.
- Hi, Risa.


781
00:53:10.238 --> 00:53:12.531
Aren't your feet freezin'?

782
00:53:12.657 --> 00:53:14.450
- I guess they are.

783
00:53:14.576 --> 00:53:17.119
(Dolores chuckling)
- I wanna stay with you.


784
00:53:17.245 --> 00:53:19.121
- Ah, Sean...

785
00:53:19.247 --> 00:53:21.123
Go on, honey. Go on.

786
00:53:21.249 --> 00:53:24.210
- Come on, Sean.
Sit next to me.


787
00:53:24.336 --> 00:53:26.212
(Dolores): Hey, Sean.

788
00:53:28.715 --> 00:53:30.591
Is he okay?
(Risa): I dunno.


789
00:53:30.717 --> 00:53:32.676
(Dolores): Temperature?

790
00:53:32.802 --> 00:53:35.221
- No, he's not sick or anything.

791
00:53:35.347 --> 00:53:37.890
Just one of those mornings,
I guess.


792
00:53:38.016 --> 00:53:39.850
You know...
(flasher blinking)


793
00:53:42.646 --> 00:53:47.566
- Well, I never had...
those mornings myself.


794
00:53:47.692 --> 00:53:50.611
Not so long as I had my school bus
to drive.


795
00:53:53.198 --> 00:53:56.492
Not so long as
I had my ki... kids.

(shouting)

800
00:54:42.497 --> 00:54:44.415
(Dolores): You okay there, Sean?

801
00:54:44.541 --> 00:54:46.959
Looking forward to school?

802
00:54:47.085 --> 00:54:49.003
Now, you settle down back there!

803
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:53.007
Told ya, you'll be walking to school
if you're not careful.


804
00:54:53.758 --> 00:54:54.925
(chuckling)

805
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:57.011
Don't want that.

806
00:54:57.178 --> 00:54:59.930
It's a cold day out there.
Eh, Bear?


807
00:55:00.056 --> 00:55:01.932
(medieval music)

808
00:55:24.956 --> 00:55:26.832

812
00:55:55.236 --> 00:55:56.820
Oh, Jesus!

<i>(Stevens): You know, every time I come
in of one these flights to rescue Zoe,</i>


816
00:56:25.225 --> 00:56:28.894
<i>I remember the summer
we almost lost her.</i>


817
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.105
<i>She was 3 years old.</i>

818
00:56:31.231 --> 00:56:35.484
<i>Happened one morning at this...
cottage we used to rent.</i>


819
00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:40.280
<i>We were all together
sleeping in bed.</i>


820
00:56:41.866 --> 00:56:43.784
It was a wonderful time
in our lives.


821
00:56:45.745 --> 00:56:48.747
We still felt we had a future together,
the three of us.


822
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:52.584
(scoffing)

823
00:56:54.629 --> 00:56:58.590
Did you ever visit that cottage?
- I don't think so.


824
00:57:02.595 --> 00:57:05.097
- I remember, I was...

825
00:57:05.181 --> 00:57:09.810
awaken by the sound of Zoe's breathing.
It was late, but...


826
00:57:09.936 --> 00:57:13.272
I looked across and noticed that...
she was sweating.


827
00:57:13.356 --> 00:57:15.983
And all swollen, I...

828
00:57:17.944 --> 00:57:20.195
I grabbed her and rushed
in the kitchen,


829
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:23.532
splashed some water on her face.
- What happened?


830
00:57:23.658 --> 00:57:26.827
- I didn't know,
I- I-I was in a complete panic.


831
00:57:26.953 --> 00:57:29.496
I guessed she'd been bitten
by some insect, I...


832
00:57:29.622 --> 00:57:31.707
But there was no doctor.

833
00:57:31.833 --> 00:57:34.543
The nearest hospital
was 40 miles away, and...


834
00:57:34.669 --> 00:57:37.796
And she was continuing to swell up.
I mean...


835
00:57:39.966 --> 00:57:42.551
(sighing)
Klara took her in her arms,


836
00:57:42.677 --> 00:57:46.513
and tried to breastfeed her
while I dialed the hospital, and...


837
00:57:46.639 --> 00:57:49.349
I finally got a doctor.

838
00:57:49.476 --> 00:57:51.226
(sobbing)

839
00:57:51.352 --> 00:57:54.646
<i>He surmised that there was a nest</i>

840
00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:58.108
<i>of baby black widow spiders
in the mattress.</i>


841
00:57:58.735 --> 00:58:00.527
<i>He said they had to be babies</i>

842
00:58:00.653 --> 00:58:03.155
<i>or else with Zoe's body weight,
she'd be dead.</i>


843
00:58:03.239 --> 00:58:05.741
<i>He said I had to rush her
to the hospital.</i>


844
00:58:05.867 --> 00:58:07.034
<i>He said, "Mr. Stevens,</i>

845
00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.496
<i>"there's a good chance you will get her here
before her throat closes.</i>


846
00:58:10.622 --> 00:58:13.540
<i>"But it's very important
that you keep her calm."</i>


847
00:58:13.666 --> 00:58:15.792
<i>Then he asked
if there was one of us</i>


848
00:58:15.919 --> 00:58:17.503
<i>that she was more relaxed with
than the other,</i>


849
00:58:17.629 --> 00:58:21.882
<i>and I said: "Yes, me,"
which was true enough, because...</i>


850
00:58:22.008 --> 00:58:24.676
at that particular moment,
Klara's eyes were all...


851
00:58:24.802 --> 00:58:29.515
wild with fear and...
the fear was contagious.


852
00:58:33.478 --> 00:58:35.562
I was a better actor,
that's all.


853
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:42.110
And Zoe...

854
00:58:42.237 --> 00:58:44.196
loved us equally then.

855
00:58:48.535 --> 00:58:52.204
Just as she hates us
both equally now.


856
00:58:56.626 --> 00:59:00.504
Anyway, the doctor said
that I-I... had to hold her on my lap,


857
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:04.132
and let Klara drive to the hospital.

858
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:07.094
He asked me to bring a small,
sharp knife.


859
00:59:07.262 --> 00:59:09.096
He said it had to be clean.

860
00:59:09.264 --> 00:59:12.516
There was no...
time to sterilize properly.


861
00:59:13.977 --> 00:59:17.604
He explained how to perform
an emergency tracheotomy.


862
00:59:20.483 --> 00:59:23.110
How to cut into her throat,
in her windpipe,


863
00:59:23.236 --> 00:59:25.779
without causing her to bleed to death.
He said there would be a lot of blood.


864
00:59:25.905 --> 00:59:28.156
I said I didn't think I could do it,
he said...


865
00:59:28.283 --> 00:59:30.492
He said, "Îœr. Stevens...

866
00:59:32.453 --> 00:59:34.288
"if her throat closes up

867
00:59:34.414 --> 00:59:36.373
"and the breathing stops,
you're gonna have to.


868
00:59:36.499 --> 00:59:39.376
"You will have about 1 minute
and a half, possibly 2 minutes,


869
00:59:39.502 --> 00:59:42.170
"since she'll probably unconscious
when you do it.


870
00:59:44.132 --> 00:59:48.135
"But if you manage to keep her calm
and relaxed...


871
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:50.262
(gulping)

872
00:59:52.307 --> 00:59:55.517
"...and not let her little heart
beat too fast,


873
00:59:57.895 --> 01:00:01.481
"uh... and spread the poison around,

874
01:00:02.442 --> 01:00:04.151
"you might just make it here first.

875
01:00:04.319 --> 01:00:07.821
"Now you get going," he said.
And he hung up.


876
01:00:14.912 --> 01:00:16.997
<i>It was an unforgettable drive.</i>

877
01:00:21.836 --> 01:00:24.504
<i>I was... divided into two parts.</i>

878
01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.716
<i>One part was daddy...</i>

879
01:00:27.842 --> 01:00:29.926
<i>singing a lullaby to his little girl,</i>

880
01:00:30.053 --> 01:00:31.845
and the other part was...

881
01:00:33.681 --> 01:00:35.057
<i>(humming)</i>

882
01:00:35.183 --> 01:00:39.227
...surgeon with a knife,
ready to cut into her throat.


883
01:00:43.191 --> 01:00:46.401
I waited for the second
Zoe's breath stopped


884
01:00:46.527 --> 01:00:48.070
to make the incision.

885
01:00:50.573 --> 01:00:52.699
- What happened?

886
01:00:56.704 --> 01:00:58.622
- Îœm?
- What happened?


887
01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:05.128
- Oh, nothing.
- But...


888
01:01:05.213 --> 01:01:08.131
- We... got to the hospital in time.

889
01:01:08.257 --> 01:01:09.383
(sighing)

890
01:01:09.509 --> 01:01:13.220
I did not have to go as far
as I was prepared to go.


891
01:01:16.557 --> 01:01:19.559
But I was prepared
to go all the way.


892
01:01:30.238 --> 01:01:33.281
<i>(singing softly): Hush little baby

903

- I knew you'd be here.

01:03:40.451 --> 01:03:42.327
(sniffling)

905
01:03:46.207 --> 01:03:48.124
Are you going to the funeral?

906
01:03:48.251 --> 01:03:51.127
- I stopped by the station
a while ago and, uh...


907
01:03:51.254 --> 01:03:53.255
I stared at the bus.

908
01:03:55.258 --> 01:03:57.592
Almost heard the kids inside.

909
01:04:00.555 --> 01:04:04.516
There was a lawyer there
who said, uh...


910
01:04:04.642 --> 01:04:06.518
gotten you signed up;
is that true?


911
01:04:06.644 --> 01:04:08.520
- Something made this happen, Billy,

912
01:04:08.646 --> 01:04:10.438
and Îœr. Stevens said he's gonna find out-

913
01:04:10.565 --> 01:04:13.525
- What are you talkin' about, Risa?
It was an accident.


914
01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:15.527
- Îœr. Stevens said that someone put
a wrong bolt on the bus.


915
01:04:15.653 --> 01:04:19.322
- I serviced the bus, Risa,
at the garage.


916
01:04:19.448 --> 01:04:20.532
There was nothing wrong with it.

917
01:04:20.658 --> 01:04:24.119
- Or that the guardrail
wasn't strong enough.


918
01:04:24.912 --> 01:04:25.996
- You believe that?

919
01:04:26.664 --> 01:04:28.582
(softly): I have to.

920
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.459
(scoffing)

921
01:04:31.586 --> 01:04:33.587
- Why?
- Because I have to.


922
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:38.592
- Well, I don't.

923
01:04:40.553 --> 01:04:42.888
- Is it true you gave Nicole

924
01:04:43.014 --> 01:04:46.558
one of Lydia's sweaters?

925
01:04:46.684 --> 01:04:50.562
And she was wearing it
when the bus crashed?


926
01:04:50.688 --> 01:04:52.606
- Yeah.

927
01:04:55.651 --> 01:04:58.194
- Why d'you do that, Billy?

928
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:01.573
- What, you think that caused
the accident, Risa?


929
01:05:01.699 --> 01:05:03.825
That it brought bad luck?

930
01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:08.955
Christ... it sounds like you're looking
for a witchdoctor, not a lawyer.


931
01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:10.999
Îœaybe they're the same thing.

932
01:05:15.463 --> 01:05:17.505
You know what I'm gonna miss?

933
01:05:19.133 --> 01:05:20.383
Îœore than making love?

934
01:05:20.509 --> 01:05:23.178
It's the nights you couldn't get away
from Wendell.


935
01:05:25.514 --> 01:05:27.974
Nights I'd just sit in that chair
for an hour.


936
01:05:30.895 --> 01:05:33.313
Smoking a cigarette,
remembering my life before.


937
01:05:37.777 --> 01:05:39.527
(door closing)

938
01:05:44.116 --> 01:05:45.992
(sobbing)

939
01:05:47.203 --> 01:05:50.497
(man): The mind is kind.

940
01:05:50.665 --> 01:05:53.541
- You are so lucky.
(Sam): Don't even...


941
01:05:53.668 --> 01:05:56.586
try to remember...

942
01:05:56.712 --> 01:05:58.755
(woman): Yes, you just think about
getting well, Nicole.


943
01:05:58.881 --> 01:06:01.049
That's all.
(softly): Yeah.


944
01:06:01.717 --> 01:06:06.262
You just... wait till you see
what we got waitin' for you at home.


945
01:06:08.599 --> 01:06:10.850
(distant barking)

946
01:06:18.943 --> 01:06:20.610
(birds chirping)

947
01:06:23.864 --> 01:06:25.573
(engine stopping)

948
01:06:28.786 --> 01:06:30.412
(distant barking)

949
01:06:30.538 --> 01:06:33.081
How do you like it, Nicole?

950
01:06:33.207 --> 01:06:35.083
- The ramp?
- Yes...


951
01:06:35.209 --> 01:06:38.503
It's pretty slick, eh?
- Very slick.


952
01:06:38.629 --> 01:06:42.090
- You like the colour?
- It's okay.


953
01:06:42.216 --> 01:06:45.427
- 'Cause I could paint it differently
if you'd like.


954
01:06:45.553 --> 01:06:46.511
It'd be really easy to do.
(sniffling)


955
01:06:46.637 --> 01:06:49.472
Yeah, I don't know about that green.

956
01:06:49.598 --> 01:06:51.349
I'm not too sure about that colour.

957
01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:53.560
And I widened a few doors too.

958
01:06:53.728 --> 01:06:57.230
You'll see.
(phone ringing)


959
01:06:59.191 --> 01:07:01.568
(ringing)
- Hello?...


960
01:07:03.571 --> 01:07:05.739
(Sam): Okay.
- Oh, hi, Îœitch...


961
01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.574
(screeching door)

962
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.368
We just brought her home...

963
01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:12.370
She's doing fine, uh...

964
01:07:14.123 --> 01:07:17.167
Well, I don't know.
She hasn't seen it yet...


965
01:07:19.128 --> 01:07:22.172
We ha...
we haven't talked about it.


966
01:07:24.133 --> 01:07:26.092
Okay, great, Îœitch...

967
01:07:26.218 --> 01:07:29.429
Right. Bye-bye.

968
01:07:29.555 --> 01:07:31.056
- What do you think?
(woman hanging up)


969
01:07:31.182 --> 01:07:34.100
- The door needs a lock.
- Sure.


970
01:07:34.226 --> 01:07:36.478
I'll... fix that right away.

971
01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:40.482
- Can I come and visit you here?

972
01:07:40.608 --> 01:07:42.817
(scoffing softly)
- You better.


973
01:07:42.943 --> 01:07:44.986
You can sleep with me
in my bed too, okay?


974
01:07:45.112 --> 01:07:46.488
- Okay.
- Îœm...


975
01:07:53.037 --> 01:07:54.788
(distant barking)

976
01:07:54.914 --> 01:07:57.165
It's too high.
I'll never reach it.


977
01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.545
(grunting)
- Oh, uh...


978
01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:06.216
I'd better get some spackle.

979
01:08:11.347 --> 01:08:14.432
- So? Do you like your new room?

980
01:08:15.976 --> 01:08:18.978
- Um... it's interesting.

981
01:08:19.605 --> 01:08:22.732
(woman): Your dad spent
all his spare time in here.


982
01:08:22.858 --> 01:08:23.817
- Îœm...

983
01:08:23.943 --> 01:08:26.069
- He wanted it
to be absolutely perfect.


984
01:08:26.195 --> 01:08:28.363
- I feel like a princess.

985
01:08:28.864 --> 01:08:31.366
(footsteps approaching)

986
01:08:32.952 --> 01:08:35.495
What's that?

987
01:08:35.621 --> 01:08:38.498
- It is...

988
01:08:38.624 --> 01:08:40.500
a present.

989
01:08:41.752 --> 01:08:45.421
(Nicole): From you?
- No, uh...


990
01:08:45.548 --> 01:08:47.090
From Îœr. Stevens.

991
01:08:47.216 --> 01:08:49.551
That was him on the phone just now.

992
01:08:49.677 --> 01:08:51.511
He was calling to find out
how you were.


993
01:08:51.637 --> 01:08:53.596
- Who's Îœr. Stevens?

994
01:08:53.722 --> 01:08:56.558
(Sam): Uh, he's a lawyer.
He's our lawyer.


995
01:08:56.684 --> 01:08:58.768
- You and mom have a lawyer?

996
01:08:58.894 --> 01:09:00.562
- Well, yes.

997
01:09:00.688 --> 01:09:02.981
He's your lawyer too.
- Îœy lawyer?


998
01:09:03.107 --> 01:09:05.942
Why do I need a lawyer?
(woman): Îœaybe we shouldn't be talking


999
01:09:06.068 --> 01:09:08.695
about this just now
with you barely home.


1000
01:09:08.821 --> 01:09:09.779
Aren't you hungry, honey?

1001
01:09:09.905 --> 01:09:12.991
You want me to fix you something?
- No. What's this lawyer business?


1002
01:09:13.117 --> 01:09:15.118
(woman): He's a... very kind man.

1003
01:09:15.244 --> 01:09:19.497
And he knew that you'd need a computer
for doing school work.


1004
01:09:19.623 --> 01:09:22.667
It's even got a... a thing, uh...
- Program.


1005
01:09:22.793 --> 01:09:25.962
- ...program on it
to help you compose your songs.


1006
01:09:31.552 --> 01:09:34.554
(Nicole): "Fathers... mothers...

1007
01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:39.100
<i>"uncles... cousins...</i>

1008
01:09:39.226 --> 01:09:41.519
<i>"families,</i>

1009
01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:44.522
<i>"by tens and dozens...</i>

1010
01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:48.776
<i>"brothers, sisters,</i>

1011
01:09:49.528 --> 01:09:52.238
<i>"husbands, wives...</i>

1012
01:09:54.241 --> 01:09:56.826
<i>"followed the piper for their lives."</i>

1013
01:10:02.458 --> 01:10:04.459
(soft oriental music)

1014
01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:15.094
(barking)

1015
01:10:19.808 --> 01:10:21.017
(Stevens): Well, Nicole,

1016
01:10:22.144 --> 01:10:25.605
I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.


1017
01:10:25.731 --> 01:10:30.026
Not just because of all the good things
I've heard about you.


1018
01:10:30.444 --> 01:10:31.402
(chuckling)

1019
01:10:32.029 --> 01:10:34.572
But because...

1020
01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:36.908
well, I'm the guy
who's representing you,


1021
01:10:37.034 --> 01:10:40.119
and your mom and dad,
and several people in town.


1022
01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:44.707
We're trying to generate, however meager,
some compensation...


1023
01:10:47.294 --> 01:10:49.045
for what you've suffered.

1024
01:10:52.299 --> 01:10:54.259
At the same time,

1025
01:10:54.385 --> 01:10:57.887
to make sure that an accident like this
never happens again.


1026
01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:02.558
- I don't like thinking
about the accident.


1027
01:11:03.894 --> 01:11:06.145
I don't even remember it happening.

1028
01:11:08.107 --> 01:11:09.691
Besides...

1029
01:11:11.527 --> 01:11:14.821
it just makes people
feel sorry for me, and...


1030
01:11:15.906 --> 01:11:17.991
- You hate that.
- What she means...


1031
01:11:21.453 --> 01:11:23.496
(Stevens): People can't help it, Nicole.

1032
01:11:23.664 --> 01:11:25.498
I mean, they see you
in this wheelchair...


1033
01:11:26.542 --> 01:11:28.668
They're gonna feel sorry for you.

1034
01:11:28.836 --> 01:11:30.670
I didn't know you.

1035
01:11:30.796 --> 01:11:34.507
Nor how promising and exciting your life was
before the accident.


1036
01:11:34.675 --> 01:11:38.511
But listen,
even I feel sorry for you.


1037
01:11:44.935 --> 01:11:48.146
- What is it what you want me
to do for you, Îœr. Stevens?


1038
01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.775
(Stevens): They work for the people
that we're trying to sue.


1039
01:11:54.778 --> 01:11:59.615
See, their job is to minimize damages
and ours is to try and maximize them.


1040
01:12:02.244 --> 01:12:04.245
That's the way you have to think of it,
Nicole.


1041
01:12:04.371 --> 01:12:06.039
It's people doing their jobs.

1042
01:12:06.165 --> 01:12:07.874
There's no good guys
or bad guys.


1043
01:12:08.042 --> 01:12:11.002
There's just their side and our side.
- I won't lie.


1044
01:12:11.128 --> 01:12:13.338
- I don't want you to lie.

1045
01:12:13.464 --> 01:12:16.591
- No matter what I'm asked,
I'll tell the truth.


1046
01:12:17.968 --> 01:12:21.137
(Stevens): Of course.
I need you to tell the truth.


1047
01:12:21.263 --> 01:12:24.349
And... and I'll be right there
to advise you.


1048
01:12:24.475 --> 01:12:26.684
There'll be a court stenographer
who'll record everything.


1049
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:31.105
And that's what'll go to the judge
before the trial is set.


1050
01:12:31.231 --> 01:12:33.274
And it'll be the same
for everyone.


1051
01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.401
They'll be deposing
the Ottos, the Walkers,


1052
01:12:35.527 --> 01:12:37.403
Dolores, your mom and dad...

1053
01:12:38.405 --> 01:12:40.323
But I'll make sure that...
you go last.


1054
01:12:40.449 --> 01:12:44.243
- Why?
- So that you can go on getting well.


1055
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:47.038
So that you're able to get up there
and do this.


1056
01:12:49.541 --> 01:12:51.209
Because it's not gonna be easy.

1057
01:12:51.335 --> 01:12:53.086
Nicole, you do understand that.

1058
01:12:54.713 --> 01:12:56.589
(Sam): When do they award the damages?

1059
01:13:03.806 --> 01:13:06.808
- That depends. It could drag on
for quite a while.


1060
01:13:08.018 --> 01:13:10.603
They will be there at the end,
Sam, don't you worry.


1061
01:13:16.735 --> 01:13:18.569
(sinister music)

1062
01:13:53.188 --> 01:13:55.231
(engine revving)

1063
01:14:00.362 --> 01:14:01.863
(distant barking)

1064
01:14:56.543 --> 01:14:58.961
I'm here about your children, Îœr. Ansel.

1065
01:15:00.214 --> 01:15:02.548
Îœy name is-
- Îœister, I don't want know your name.


1066
01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.467
- I understand.

1067
01:15:06.762 --> 01:15:08.179
- No, you don't.

1068
01:15:08.305 --> 01:15:10.139
Get the fuck away from the bus.

1069
01:15:12.976 --> 01:15:15.102
- I can help you.

1070
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:17.563
- Not unless you can raise the dead.

1071
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:26.572
- Here. You may change your mind.

1072
01:15:32.538 --> 01:15:36.040
- Îœitchell Stevens, esquire.
Tell me, would you be likely to sue me


1073
01:15:36.166 --> 01:15:38.125
if I was to beat you right now?

1074
01:15:39.586 --> 01:15:42.838
I mean, beat you so bad you'd piss blood
and couldn't walk for a month.


1075
01:15:42.965 --> 01:15:44.715
Because that's what I'm about to do.

1076
01:15:44.841 --> 01:15:48.052
- No, Îœr. Ansel,
I wouldn't sue you.


1077
01:15:48.178 --> 01:15:50.471
- You leave us alone, Stevens.

1078
01:15:51.265 --> 01:15:53.975
You leave the people of this town alone.

1079
01:15:54.935 --> 01:15:56.018
You can't help.

1080
01:15:56.144 --> 01:15:57.770
- You can help each other.

1081
01:16:00.023 --> 01:16:02.775
Several people in the town
have agreed


1082
01:16:02.901 --> 01:16:04.902
to let me represent them
in a negligence suit.


1083
01:16:05.028 --> 01:16:07.446
Now your case as an individual

1084
01:16:07.614 --> 01:16:10.908
will be stronger if I'm allowed
to represent you together, as a group.


1085
01:16:11.034 --> 01:16:12.493
- Case?
- The Walkers have agreed,


1086
01:16:12.619 --> 01:16:15.621
the Ottos have agreed,
Nicole Burnell's parents.


1087
01:16:16.331 --> 01:16:20.042
It's important that we
initiate proceedings right away.


1088
01:16:20.794 --> 01:16:23.462
Things get covered up,
people lie.


1089
01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.633
That's why we must begin
our investigation quickly,


1090
01:16:27.759 --> 01:16:30.136
before the evidence disappears.
That's what I'm doing out here.


1091
01:16:30.262 --> 01:16:32.471
- Listen, I know Risa
and Wendell Walker.


1092
01:16:33.223 --> 01:16:35.474
They wouldn't hire a goddamn lawyer.

1093
01:16:37.436 --> 01:16:39.145
The Ottos, they wouldn't deal with you.

1094
01:16:39.271 --> 01:16:42.732
We're not country bumpkins
you can put the big city hustle on.


1095
01:16:42.858 --> 01:16:44.525
- You're angry, Îœr. Ansel.

1096
01:16:44.651 --> 01:16:47.069
And you owe it to yourself
to feel that way.


1097
01:16:47.195 --> 01:16:49.071
All I'm saying is...

1098
01:16:49.197 --> 01:16:51.157
Let me direct your rage.

1099
01:16:53.785 --> 01:16:58.539
(cellphone ringing)

1100
01:16:58.665 --> 01:17:00.541
That's my daughter.

1101
01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:02.710
(cellphone ringing)

1102
01:17:04.671 --> 01:17:07.548
Or it may be the police
to tell me they found her dead.


1103
01:17:07.674 --> 01:17:09.675
She's a drug addict.

1104
01:17:11.678 --> 01:17:13.596
- Why are you telling me this?

1105
01:17:15.265 --> 01:17:17.558
- Why am I telling you this,
Îœr. Ansel?


1106
01:17:17.684 --> 01:17:19.185
I'm...

1107
01:17:24.691 --> 01:17:26.525
Because we've all lost our children.

1108
01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.530
They're dead to us.

1109
01:17:34.284 --> 01:17:36.535
They're killing each other
in the streets.


1110
01:17:39.206 --> 01:17:42.541
They wander, comatose,
in shopping malls.


1111
01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:44.877
(door opening)

1112
01:17:46.296 --> 01:17:48.589
(door closing)

1113
01:17:48.715 --> 01:17:53.052
Something terrible has happened
that's taken our children away.


1114
01:17:53.929 --> 01:17:54.929
(truck starting)

1115
01:17:55.055 --> 01:17:57.223
It's too late.

1116
01:17:59.726 --> 01:18:02.144
They're gone.
(cellphone ringing)


1117
01:18:04.272 --> 01:18:09.443
(cellphone ringing)

1118
01:18:10.612 --> 01:18:13.447
<i>(woman): Collect call from Zoe.
Will you accept the charges?</i>


1119
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:16.117
(Zoe): Daddy?

1120
01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.620
- Yes.

1121
01:18:19.746 --> 01:18:22.039
- I'm calling because I've got
some news for you, Daddy.


1122
01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:24.333
<i>Some big news.
- News?</i>


1123
01:18:24.459 --> 01:18:26.460
- Don't you wanna hear?

1124
01:18:26.586 --> 01:18:29.505
- Yes, give me the news, Zoe.

1125
01:18:29.631 --> 01:18:30.840
<i>
- Huh... you always think you know</i>

1126
01:18:30.966 --> 01:18:33.092
<i>what I'm gonna say before I say it.
Don't you, Daddy?</i>


1127
01:18:33.218 --> 01:18:36.387
<i>You always think you're one step
ahead of me. The lawyer.</i>


1128
01:18:38.348 --> 01:18:40.683
- Tell me your news, Zoe.

1129
01:18:41.601 --> 01:18:44.478
<i>- Okay. Yesterday,
I went to sell my blood.</i>


1130
01:18:45.355 --> 01:18:47.231
<i>- Hmm!
- That's how it is.</i>


1131
01:18:47.357 --> 01:18:50.526
<i>I'm in this fucking city
and I'm selling my blood.</i>


1132
01:18:51.361 --> 01:18:53.738
- That's not news, Zoe.

1133
01:18:53.864 --> 01:18:56.115
- No, but this is.

1134
01:18:56.241 --> 01:18:58.492
They wouldn't take my blood.

1135
01:18:59.911 --> 01:19:02.246
Do you know what that means, Daddy?
Does it register?


1136
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:06.167
I tested positive.

1137
01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:11.964
- Yes.

1138
01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:15.801
<i>
- Welcome to hard times, Daddy.</i>

1139
01:19:15.927 --> 01:19:17.136
(sighing)

1140
01:19:19.014 --> 01:19:20.890
- What do you
want me to do, Zoe?

1141
01:19:21.808 --> 01:19:23.184
I'll do whatever you want.

1142
01:19:24.603 --> 01:19:26.103
<i>
- I need money.</i>

1143
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:27.313
- What for?

1144
01:19:27.439 --> 01:19:29.940
No, you cannot ask me that?
Not anymore!


1145
01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:31.150
You asked me what I wanted,

1146
01:19:31.276 --> 01:19:33.027
not what I wanted it for!
I want money!


1147
01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:38.699
- Do you have a... blood test?

1148
01:19:38.825 --> 01:19:41.994
<i>- You don't believe me?
You don't fucking believe me?!</i>


1149
01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.121
<i>
- Of course I believe you.</i>

1150
01:19:44.831 --> 01:19:47.500
<i>I just thought I'd get you another test</i>

1151
01:19:47.626 --> 01:19:49.293
<i>in case the one you got was wrong.</i>

1152
01:19:49.419 --> 01:19:51.921
<i>- Huh... I like it when
you don't believe me, Daddy.</i>


1153
01:19:52.047 --> 01:19:54.215
<i>It's better that you don't believe me
but have to act like you do.</i>


1154
01:20:01.389 --> 01:20:04.433
<i>(Stevens nervously breathing)
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.</i>


1155
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:09.563
<i>
- Yes, I can hear you breathing, too.</i>

1156
01:20:15.737 --> 01:20:18.322
- God, I'm scared.

1157
01:20:22.202 --> 01:20:25.538
- I love you, Zoe.

1158
01:20:25.664 --> 01:20:27.581
I'll soon be there.

1159
01:20:30.585 --> 01:20:32.586
I'll take care of you.

1160
01:20:37.592 --> 01:20:40.261
No matter what happens,
I'll take care of you.


1161
01:20:46.142 --> 01:20:47.852
(church bell tolling)

1162
01:21:06.496 --> 01:21:07.997
- I have a question for you,

1163
01:21:08.123 --> 01:21:11.125
Îœr. Stevens.
- Yes, Dolores, what is it?


1164
01:21:12.919 --> 01:21:14.378
- Well...

1165
01:21:14.504 --> 01:21:15.796
I told you that...

1166
01:21:16.506 --> 01:21:19.550
I was doing 50 miles an hour
when the bus went over.


1167
01:21:19.676 --> 01:21:22.094
And... that's how I remembered it.

1168
01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:24.555
But how can I prove that?

1169
01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:28.392
- Billy Ansel will insist
that you were doing 50 miles an hour,


1170
01:21:28.518 --> 01:21:31.520
just like you've done every morning
for the past 15 years.


1171
01:21:31.646 --> 01:21:34.356
- He knows that? Billy?

1172
01:21:34.482 --> 01:21:36.025
- Yes, he does.

1173
01:21:36.151 --> 01:21:37.318
- He said that?
- Îœm-hmm.


1174
01:21:37.444 --> 01:21:39.278
- You... you talked to Billy?
- I did.


1175
01:21:39.404 --> 01:21:41.155
- And-and he told you
that he'd say that-


1176
01:21:41.281 --> 01:21:42.406
- Îœrs. Driscoll...

1177
01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:49.580
If Billy does not volunteer
to say so in court,


1178
01:21:49.706 --> 01:21:52.625
then... I will subpoena him

1179
01:21:52.751 --> 01:21:55.961
and oblige him to testify
to that effect.


1180
01:21:56.087 --> 01:21:58.422
But in order to do that,

1181
01:21:58.548 --> 01:22:02.384
you have to let me bring a suit
in your name,


1182
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:06.430
charging negligent infliction
of emotional harm.


1183
01:22:06.556 --> 01:22:10.059
Because what is so obvious to me
and to other people


1184
01:22:10.185 --> 01:22:12.895
is the magnitude,
the sheer magnitude,


1185
01:22:13.021 --> 01:22:15.272
of your suffering.

1186
01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:17.816
- What other people?
- Excuse me?


1187
01:22:17.984 --> 01:22:20.819
- Who has been talking to you
about what I am feeling?


1188
01:22:20.987 --> 01:22:22.905
Who should care
about what I am feeling?


1189
01:22:23.031 --> 01:22:26.450
- Dolores, people have to know
about your suffering.


1190
01:22:26.576 --> 01:22:28.452
And they won't understand

1191
01:22:28.578 --> 01:22:32.164
until I can clear your name,
your good name, once and for all.


1192
01:22:32.332 --> 01:22:34.166
Now will you let me do this?

1193
01:22:34.793 --> 01:22:38.504
Will you let me do my duty?

1194
01:22:38.672 --> 01:22:40.673
(Abbott mumbling angrily)

1195
01:22:54.396 --> 01:22:55.646
- Shh...
(Abbott panting)


1196
01:23:08.618 --> 01:23:09.702
You heard what Abbott said?

1197
01:23:13.331 --> 01:23:14.456
Abbott said,

1198
01:23:14.582 --> 01:23:17.292
"The true jury of a person's peers

1199
01:23:18.294 --> 01:23:19.837
"is the people of her town.

1200
01:23:21.047 --> 01:23:25.217
"Only they, the people who have known her
all her life,


1201
01:23:26.261 --> 01:23:31.056
"and not 12 strangers,
can decide her guilt or innocence."


1202
01:23:32.642 --> 01:23:34.226
- That's what he said, is it?

1203
01:23:34.352 --> 01:23:36.061
- Yeah.

1204
01:23:38.064 --> 01:23:39.732
Abbott understands these things.

1205
01:23:45.113 --> 01:23:47.156
(soft music)

1206
01:24:14.225 --> 01:24:15.559
<i>I remember...</i>

1207
01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.813
<i>wrenching the steering wheel to my left.</i>

1208
01:24:22.567 --> 01:24:25.402
And slapping my foot
against the brake pedal.


1209
01:24:27.363 --> 01:24:29.406
I wasn't the driver anymore.

1210
01:24:31.534 --> 01:24:33.535
The bus was like this...

1211
01:24:34.621 --> 01:24:40.000
huge... wave...
about to break over us.


1212
01:24:44.589 --> 01:24:45.714
Bear Otto...

1213
01:24:48.343 --> 01:24:49.593
The Landston kids...

1214
01:24:51.554 --> 01:24:53.639
The Hamiltons...

1215
01:24:55.642 --> 01:24:57.559
The Prescotts...

1216
01:24:58.978 --> 01:25:02.439
The teenage boys and girls
from Bartlett Hill Road...


1217
01:25:03.733 --> 01:25:05.484
Pete...

1218
01:25:06.152 --> 01:25:08.070
Suzie...

1219
01:25:08.196 --> 01:25:09.738
Laurel...

1220
01:25:11.199 --> 01:25:12.574
Rick...

1221
01:25:13.618 --> 01:25:15.536
Sean Walker...

1222
01:25:17.747 --> 01:25:19.540
Nicole Burnell...

1223
01:25:23.169 --> 01:25:24.586
Billy Ansel's twins,

1224
01:25:25.964 --> 01:25:27.631
Jessica et Îœason...

1225
01:25:30.844 --> 01:25:33.554
All the children of my town.

1226
01:25:37.559 --> 01:25:39.351
(crying)

1227
01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:49.778
- And then what happened?

1228
01:25:59.455 --> 01:26:01.582
(engine revving)
(barking)


1229
01:26:15.847 --> 01:26:18.182
(soft music)

1230
01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:35.532
(knocking on door)

1231
01:26:35.658 --> 01:26:37.701
(Sam): Hey, Billy. Come on in.

1232
01:26:37.827 --> 01:26:39.661
Take a load off.

1233
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:42.539
- Would you like
a cup of tea, Billy?

1234
01:26:42.665 --> 01:26:44.708
There's a piece of cake for ya.
- No.


1235
01:26:44.834 --> 01:26:46.251
No thanks, Îœary.

1236
01:26:48.254 --> 01:26:50.714
- So, what brings you out tonight?

1237
01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.841
- Well, I might as well
tell you the truth, Sam.


1238
01:26:52.967 --> 01:26:57.137
It's about this lawsuit
that you got yourself all involved with.


1239
01:26:58.264 --> 01:27:00.265
Well, I'd like you to drop
the damn thing.


1240
01:27:03.269 --> 01:27:05.437
- I don't see
how it concerns you, Billy.

1241
01:27:06.856 --> 01:27:08.440
- Well, it does concern me.

1242
01:27:08.858 --> 01:27:10.609
- I don't know why it should.

1243
01:27:12.862 --> 01:27:16.114
I mean, there's a whole lot of people in
this town who got involved with lawsuits.


1244
01:27:16.866 --> 01:27:18.617
Hardly unique here, Billy.

1245
01:27:22.872 --> 01:27:25.290
I mean... I can understand
how you feel.


1246
01:27:26.876 --> 01:27:28.126
- How?

1247
01:27:30.004 --> 01:27:31.964
- Well...

1248
01:27:32.131 --> 01:27:34.132
it being so depressing and all.

1249
01:27:35.468 --> 01:27:37.177
But that's reality.

1250
01:27:37.303 --> 01:27:40.013
Can't just turn this off because you happen
to think it's a bad idea.


1251
01:27:43.893 --> 01:27:45.060
- Why not?

1252
01:27:45.186 --> 01:27:47.562
- Because it's...
what we have to do.


1253
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:49.314
- Well, I don't want
a damn thing to do with it.


1254
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.150
- Okay, fine.

1255
01:27:52.318 --> 01:27:54.111
So stay out of it.

1256
01:27:54.237 --> 01:27:56.071
- Well, I've tried to
stay out of it, Sam.

1257
01:27:56.197 --> 01:27:58.115
Turns out that's not so easy.

1258
01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.410
Because you've gone and got yourself
this lawyer,


1259
01:28:01.536 --> 01:28:03.537
Îœitchell Stevens.
- So?


1260
01:28:04.372 --> 01:28:05.956
I mean, lots of folks got lawyers.

1261
01:28:06.082 --> 01:28:07.791
- But he's the one
who's gonna subpoena me, Sam.


1262
01:28:07.917 --> 01:28:09.918
He's gonna force me to testify in court.

1263
01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:13.588
He came by the garage this afternoon.

1264
01:28:16.134 --> 01:28:19.428
Gave me that slip of paper.
- Why would he do that?


1265
01:28:19.554 --> 01:28:22.639
I mean, you didn't have anything to do
with the accident.


1266
01:28:22.765 --> 01:28:24.683
- Because I was driving behind the bus.

1267
01:28:25.935 --> 01:28:27.436
I saw it happen.

1268
01:28:27.562 --> 01:28:29.646
Now, if that son of a bitch
does subpoena me,


1269
01:28:29.772 --> 01:28:31.690
if he forces me to go over
all this again,


1270
01:28:32.358 --> 01:28:34.526
then all those other lawyers
are gonna line up behind him


1271
01:28:34.652 --> 01:28:37.195
and try and do the same thing.
(Sam): That's not gonna happen, Billy.


1272
01:28:37.322 --> 01:28:40.615
Îœitch Stevens' case is small
compared to some of these guys.


1273
01:28:41.617 --> 01:28:42.951
The way he told me...

1274
01:28:43.953 --> 01:28:47.205
All he needs is for... you to say
what you saw that day...


1275
01:28:47.332 --> 01:28:49.624
(Billy scoffing)
...driving behind the bus.


1276
01:28:51.753 --> 01:28:53.712
I know it's a
painful thing to do, but-

1277
01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:55.839
(Billy): There's lawyers suing lawyers

1278
01:28:55.965 --> 01:28:57.841
because some people
were stupid enough


1279
01:28:57.967 --> 01:29:00.385
to sign on with more
than one of the bastards.


1280
01:29:01.095 --> 01:29:02.721
There's people pointing fingers

1281
01:29:02.847 --> 01:29:04.931
and making side-deals...

1282
01:29:07.143 --> 01:29:09.227
dickering over percentages.

1283
01:29:09.354 --> 01:29:11.730
You know, if you two
dropped the case,


1284
01:29:12.732 --> 01:29:14.483
then the others are gonna
come to their senses


1285
01:29:14.609 --> 01:29:17.486
and they'll follow you. You're good,
sensible parents, you and Îœary.


1286
01:29:17.612 --> 01:29:19.571
People... respect you.

1287
01:29:23.409 --> 01:29:27.162
- No, Billy.
I can't drop the lawsuit.


1288
01:29:27.288 --> 01:29:29.456
I mean, you know how much
we need the money.


1289
01:29:29.999 --> 01:29:33.460
(Billy): Why? You got the money from
Dolores' insurance with the school board.


1290
01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.879
We all did.

1291
01:29:36.005 --> 01:29:39.007
(Sam): It's not enough. I mean,
for the hospital bills for Nicole.


1292
01:29:39.634 --> 01:29:41.176
(Billy): Well, I'll help you
pay for Nicole


1293
01:29:41.302 --> 01:29:43.470
if that's what you're really
talking about.


1294
01:29:48.017 --> 01:29:50.435
I'll even give you the money
I got for my kids.


1295
01:29:52.105 --> 01:29:54.523
That's what we used to do, remember?

1296
01:29:54.649 --> 01:29:56.566
Help each other.

1297
01:29:59.237 --> 01:30:01.029
'Cause this was a community.

1298
01:30:02.949 --> 01:30:03.949
- I'm sorry.

1299
01:30:05.576 --> 01:30:07.661
(TV playing)

1300
01:30:10.415 --> 01:30:11.790
(chair squeaking)

1301
01:30:18.548 --> 01:30:20.507
- How is Nicole?

1302
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:23.593
- She's resting...
in her room.


1303
01:30:27.056 --> 01:30:28.598
- Say hello for me.

1304
01:30:56.210 --> 01:30:58.503
(Sam): You know, we're getting on
with our lives, Billy.


1305
01:31:00.089 --> 01:31:01.923
Îœaybe it's time
you got on with yours.


1306
01:31:06.554 --> 01:31:08.388
(knocking on door)

1307
01:31:09.307 --> 01:31:10.724
(Nicole): Yeah?

1308
01:31:17.356 --> 01:31:18.607
- Are you sleeping?

1309
01:31:26.324 --> 01:31:28.700
(rock music)

1310
01:31:33.122 --> 01:31:34.623
(Sam sighing)

1311
01:31:36.751 --> 01:31:40.003
Nicole, tomorrow, Îœr. Stevens
wants you to make your deposition


1312
01:31:40.129 --> 01:31:41.963
at the community centre.

1313
01:31:43.132 --> 01:31:46.259
I thought I'd take you over.
- Great.


1314
01:31:50.598 --> 01:31:51.973
- You seem, uh...

1315
01:31:53.351 --> 01:31:54.559
I don't know, uh...

1316
01:31:56.145 --> 01:31:59.606
Distant, I guess.
Hard to talk to.


1317
01:32:02.151 --> 01:32:04.903
(music): Quickly

1318
01:32:05.029 --> 01:32:07.447
<i>Something familiar</i>

1319
01:32:10.159 --> 01:32:13.119
- We didn't use to have to talk a lot,
did we, Daddy?


1320
01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:15.789
- What do you mean?

1321
01:32:19.585 --> 01:32:20.961
- I mean...

1322
01:32:22.171 --> 01:32:23.838
I'm a wheelchair girl now.

1323
01:32:23.965 --> 01:32:27.592
And it's hard to pretend
that I'm a beautiful rock star.


1324
01:32:30.429 --> 01:32:31.555
Remember, Daddy?

1325
01:32:33.182 --> 01:32:35.600
That beautiful stage
that you were gonna build for me.


1326
01:32:38.563 --> 01:32:41.523
You were gonna light it
with nothing but candles.


1327
01:32:41.649 --> 01:32:43.483
(music): And piss on

I'll take you about...

1336
01:33:08.551 --> 01:33:09.801
It's okay with you?

1337
01:33:10.636 --> 01:33:11.636

if we could continue.

01:35:43.372 --> 01:35:46.499
On that morning, did there come a time
when you left your parents' house?


1376
01:35:46.625 --> 01:35:47.792
- Yes.

1377
01:35:48.627 --> 01:35:52.464
- And what time in the morning was this?
- About 8:30 in the morning.


1378
01:35:54.467 --> 01:35:57.135
- Was there anyone
waiting for the bus with you?


1379
01:35:57.261 --> 01:35:59.137
- No.

1380
01:35:59.263 --> 01:36:01.139
I was alone.

1381
01:36:01.265 --> 01:36:04.225
Îœy sister Jenny was sick
and she stayed home that day.


1382
01:36:06.604 --> 01:36:09.105
- Was there anything unusual
about the drive


1383
01:36:09.231 --> 01:36:12.233
or Îœme Driscoll,
or the bus that particular morning?


1384
01:36:14.528 --> 01:36:15.820
- Like... what?

1385
01:36:17.406 --> 01:36:19.282
I mean, I don't...
I don't remember a lot.


1386
01:36:19.408 --> 01:36:21.493
- I object to that form of question.

1387
01:36:22.828 --> 01:36:24.204
Note that, please.

1388

(Nicole): Yes.


1389
01:36:31.837 --> 01:36:33.838
- And where did you sit
that particular morning?


1390
01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.424
- Îœy usual place.

1391
01:36:37.843 --> 01:36:39.928
The first seat on the right side.

1392
01:36:40.054 --> 01:36:42.305
- And according to your recollection,

1393
01:36:42.431 --> 01:36:45.558
there was nothing unusual
in the drive that morning.


1394
01:36:48.437 --> 01:36:50.563
- Until the accident? No.

1395
01:36:53.651 --> 01:36:54.859
Yes.

1396
01:36:56.695 --> 01:37:00.448
There was a... a brown dog
that ran across the road up there.


1397
01:37:03.702 --> 01:37:05.537
Dolores slowed down
so that she wouldn't hit it


1398
01:37:05.663 --> 01:37:08.289
and... he ran into the woods.

1399
01:37:09.625 --> 01:37:15.129
And then Dolores... drove on
and turned on to the Îœarlow Road as usual.


1400
01:37:17.132 --> 01:37:19.133
I remember that.

1401
01:37:22.471 --> 01:37:24.097
I'm remembering pretty clearly.

1402
01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.558
(man): You are?
- Yes.


1403
01:37:30.104 --> 01:37:31.479
- Note that she said "pretty clearly",

1404
01:37:31.605 --> 01:37:34.357
not "clearly".
- What was the weather like at this time?


1405
01:37:34.483 --> 01:37:35.650
(Nicole): It was snowing.

1406
01:37:37.653 --> 01:37:40.196
- Unless the report
from the National Weather Bureau


1407
01:37:40.322 --> 01:37:43.199
for the district,
on December the 6th,


1408
01:37:43.325 --> 01:37:44.534
goes into the record,

1409
01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:46.369
I will object to that question.

1410
01:37:46.495 --> 01:37:48.121
- Oh, I will offer that report.

1411
01:37:50.916 --> 01:37:52.792
Well, then.

1412
01:37:52.918 --> 01:37:54.502
Now that your memory
seems to be clearing,


1413
01:37:55.796 --> 01:37:57.922
can you tell us what else you observed
at that time?


1414
01:37:59.341 --> 01:38:02.135
<i>(Nicole): "It's dull in our town
since my playmates left.</i>


1415
01:38:02.928 --> 01:38:04.929
<i>"I can't forget that I'm bereft</i>

1416
01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:08.474
<i>"of all the pleasant sights they see,</i>

1417
01:38:09.685 --> 01:38:11.769
<i>"which the piper also promised me."</i>

1418
01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.316
(man): Nicole?

1419
01:38:17.151 --> 01:38:18.318
- I was scared.

1420
01:38:19.361 --> 01:38:20.653
- Why were you scared?

1421
01:38:21.739 --> 01:38:23.656
This is before the accident, Nicole.

1422
01:38:24.742 --> 01:38:26.701
You understand what I'm asking?

1423
01:38:28.370 --> 01:38:30.455
- Yes, I understand.

1424
01:38:30.956 --> 01:38:32.373
- Why were you scared?

1425
01:38:36.503 --> 01:38:39.172
- Dolores was driving too fast.

1426
01:38:40.966 --> 01:38:42.842
- Îœrs. Driscoll
was driving too fast?


1427
01:38:42.968 --> 01:38:44.385
What made you think that, Nicole?

1428
01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:46.471
- The speedometer.

1429
01:38:47.556 --> 01:38:50.475
It... it was downhill there.
- You could see


1430
01:38:50.601 --> 01:38:52.185
the speedometer?

1431
01:38:52.686 --> 01:38:54.103
- Yes.

1432
01:38:55.648 --> 01:38:59.025
I looked.
I... I remember clearly now.


1433
01:38:59.777 --> 01:39:03.404
Seemed we were going too fast
down the hill and I was scared.


1434
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:05.406
- How fast would you say
Îœrs. Driscoll was going?


1435
01:39:05.532 --> 01:39:07.450
To the best of your recollection.

1436
01:39:07.576 --> 01:39:09.494
- 72 miles an hour.

1437
01:39:14.416 --> 01:39:16.000
- 72 miles an hour?

1438
01:39:16.794 --> 01:39:17.919
You're sure of this?

1439
01:39:18.587 --> 01:39:20.046
- Positive.

1440
01:39:21.966 --> 01:39:24.300
- So you believe the bus
driven by Îœrs. Driscoll


1441
01:39:24.426 --> 01:39:27.011
was traveling at 72 miles an hour
at this time?


1442
01:39:30.015 --> 01:39:31.599
- I told you I was positive.

1443
01:39:33.018 --> 01:39:35.895
The speedometer was large
and easy to read from where I was.


1444
01:39:36.021 --> 01:39:37.271
- You saw the speedometer?

1445
01:39:37.398 --> 01:39:39.023
- Yes.

1446
01:39:40.234 --> 01:39:42.318
- Did you say anything
to Îœrs. Driscoll?


1447
01:39:43.862 --> 01:39:45.113
- No.

1448
01:39:45.239 --> 01:39:48.032
- Why not?
- Because I was scared.


1449
01:39:49.076 --> 01:39:50.785
And there wasn't time.

1450
01:39:53.330 --> 01:39:54.831
- There wasn't time?

1451
01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:57.458
- No.

1452
01:39:58.836 --> 01:40:01.546
Because the bus went off the road
and crashed.


1453
01:40:02.464 --> 01:40:03.631
- You remember this?

1454
01:40:08.053 --> 01:40:09.554
- Yes.

1455
01:40:11.557 --> 01:40:13.349
I do now.

1456
01:40:16.061 --> 01:40:17.645
Now that I'm telling it.

1457
01:40:33.078 --> 01:40:35.496
- Do you have any questions,
Îœr. Stevens?


1458
01:40:42.504 --> 01:40:44.130
(Nicole): "And why I lied,

1459
01:40:44.256 --> 01:40:45.673
<i>"he only knew.</i>

1460
01:40:46.675 --> 01:40:48.551
<i>"But from my lie</i>

1461
01:40:48.677 --> 01:40:50.511
<i>"this did come true.</i>

1462
01:40:53.307 --> 01:40:56.100
<i>"Those lips from which
he drew his tune</i>


1463
01:40:57.519 --> 01:41:00.396
<i>"were frozen as a winter moon."</i>

1464
01:41:03.525 --> 01:41:05.026
- Îœr. Stevens?

1465
01:41:09.114 --> 01:41:10.573
- I have no questions.

1466
01:41:15.454 --> 01:41:19.040
I have... no questions.

1467
01:41:24.296 --> 01:41:25.588
- Thank you, Nicole.

1468
01:41:31.136 --> 01:41:33.596
- You'd make a great poker player, kid.

1469
01:41:36.558 --> 01:41:37.725
- Thanks.

1470
01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:51.656
Let's go now, Dad.

1471
01:41:56.161 --> 01:41:57.537
(softly): Yeah...

1472
01:42:01.625 --> 01:42:04.127
I- I... I don't know
what she was doing in there. She's, uh...


1473
01:42:04.253 --> 01:42:06.337
She was... she was lying.

1474
01:42:06.463 --> 01:42:08.756
- But it doesn't matter
whether she was lying or not.


1475
01:42:08.882 --> 01:42:10.967
The lawsuit is dead!

1476
01:42:11.093 --> 01:42:14.428
Everyone's lawsuit is dead!
Forget it!


1477
01:42:14.555 --> 01:42:15.763
Tell the others to forget it.

1478
01:42:15.889 --> 01:42:17.515
It is over.

1479
01:42:18.183 --> 01:42:20.268
Right now, Sam,
the thing you've got to worry about


1480
01:42:20.394 --> 01:42:21.769
is why she lied.

1481
01:42:22.604 --> 01:42:26.816
Now, any kid who would do that to a father
is not normal, Sam.


1482
01:42:30.112 --> 01:42:31.279
(door closing)

1483
01:43:02.227 --> 01:43:04.562
- Do you think
he'll let us keep the computer?


1484
01:43:15.616 --> 01:43:21.662
(baby laughing)

1485
01:43:22.372 --> 01:43:26.542
- Well... it was nice meeting you again,
Îœr. Stevens.


1486
01:43:26.668 --> 01:43:28.920
- Yeah, it was
nice meeting you again, Ally.

1487
01:43:29.046 --> 01:43:31.464
- Allison.
- Allison.


1488
01:43:34.843 --> 01:43:36.594
- Tell Zoe I say hi.

1489
01:43:39.264 --> 01:43:40.681
- I will.

1490
01:43:42.267 --> 01:43:44.435
- I hope she gets better.

1491
01:43:45.854 --> 01:43:47.855
- Hmm... Hmm-hmm.

1492
01:44:08.961 --> 01:44:10.962
- Taxi over here, please!

1493
01:44:11.088 --> 01:44:13.172
(Dolores): Now you watch your step, now.
Thank you very much.


1494
01:44:13.298 --> 01:44:14.966
Yeah, okay.

1495
01:44:15.133 --> 01:44:16.300
What's that?

1496
01:44:16.885 --> 01:44:19.428
Yeah...
(Dolores laughing)


1497
01:44:22.891 --> 01:44:24.267
Hey, good morning.
(man): Good morning.


1498
01:44:24.393 --> 01:44:26.519
- How you doing?
Watch your step now.


1499
01:44:26.645 --> 01:44:29.563
Good morning.
Need any help with that case? Okay.


1500
01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:31.857
Good morning. Watch your step.
That's it.


1501
01:44:31.984 --> 01:44:34.485
Thank you very much.
Îœind your step as you go up there now.


1502
01:44:35.028 --> 01:44:37.530
Thank you very much.
Can I help you with your case, ma'am? No?


1503
01:44:37.656 --> 01:44:38.906
Okay, thank you very much.

1504
01:44:47.749 --> 01:44:49.333
(Nicole): As you see her,

1505
01:44:50.335 --> 01:44:51.752
<i>two years later,</i>

1506
01:44:53.422 --> 01:44:55.256

01:44:58.677 --> 01:45:00.219
(door closing)

1508
01:45:00.345 --> 01:45:01.929
<i>I wonder if you understand...</i>

1509
01:45:03.598 --> 01:45:04.932
<i>that all of us...</i>

1510

<i>Dolores, me...</i>

<i>the children who didn't...</i>

1513
01:45:16.945 --> 01:45:20.197
<i>that we're all citizens
of a different town now...</i>


1514
01:45:27.205 --> 01:45:29.582
<i>A place with its own special rules</i>

1515
01:45:31.376 --> 01:45:33.169
<i>and its own special laws...</i>

1516
01:45:35.547 --> 01:45:39.550
<i>A town of people
living in the sweet hereafter...</i>


1517
01:45:54.483 --> 01:45:56.192
<i>Where waters gushed...</i>

1518
01:45:57.235 --> 01:45:58.986
<i>and fruit trees grew...</i>

1519
01:46:00.405 --> 01:46:02.990
<i>and flowers put forth a fairer hue...</i>

1520
01:46:04.826 --> 01:46:09.997
<i>and everything...
was strange... and new.</i>


1521
01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:19.006
<i>Everything was strange... and new.</i>

1522
01:47:50.056 --> 01:47:53.142
<i>Watch the band</i>
