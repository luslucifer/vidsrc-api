2
00:01:28.914 --> 00:01:30.040
Aren't you scared?

3
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:34.044
That's cute.

4
00:01:36.088 --> 00:01:38.048
Not the butterfly

5
00:01:44.263 --> 00:01:45.139
Now, listen.

6
00:01:45.848 --> 00:01:47.558
Once the duel begins,

7
00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:52.229
you'll have to confront him
as the head of the clan.


8
00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:55.149
But you won't need to fight.

9
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.612
We won't let him touch you, Matashichiro.

10
00:02:18.422 --> 00:02:21.884
He already killed two of your leaders,

11
00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:25.846
and now that boy is your new head?

12
00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.476
I think your days are numbered.

13
00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:31.477
You mercenary!

14
00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:35.189
Watch your mouth, you money-grubber!

15
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.275
There is no time to argue.

16
00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:47.743
Today, Miyamoto Musashi will die.

17
00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:54.500
We'll avenge Seijuro and Denshiro.

18
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:00.130
And we will kill the bastard

19
00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:05.761
to restore our reputation.

20
00:03:07.012 --> 00:03:09.973
He's late. Did he get cold feet?

21
00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:11.392
I doubt it.

22
00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:16.021
Maybe he's planning a sneak attack.
He did the same to Seijuro.


23
00:03:17.648 --> 00:03:20.150
You've seen Musashi's face before, right?

24
00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:22.695
Yes. I would never forget.

25
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.613
He looked

26
00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:27.574
How did he look?

27
00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:30.327
He looked

28
00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:35.290
Ah, I gotta take a dump.

29
00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:48.804
Isn't it about time?

30
00:03:48.887 --> 00:03:50.014
Be patient.

31
00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:54.518
The man is full of dirty tricks.

32
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.187
That's why we strategized this duel
in advance.


33
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.402
I don't wanna die! 
I don't wanna die!!

34
00:04:04.862 --> 00:04:07.072
A monster! A monster is coming!

35
00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:20.169
We've gathered 100 of our students
and 300 mercenaries.


36
00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:25.758
Sensei!

37
00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:31.347
Seijuro was like a brother to me.

38
00:04:33.098 --> 00:04:36.143
I, Chusuke, promise to avenge him.

39
00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:44.610
Even the notorious Musashi

40
00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:49.406
will not survive this army of men.

41
00:04:51.992 --> 00:04:52.910
Sir.

42
00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:57.665
If I may, an army for a single opponent
is not a good look


43
00:04:58.248 --> 00:05:00.084
for honorable samurais like us.

44
00:05:05.214 --> 00:05:08.008
This is far from being a duel.

45
00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:10.969
What if

46
00:05:11.053 --> 00:05:15.307
What if those mercenaries
end up killing Musashi?


47
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:17.059
We'll be a laughingstock.

48
00:05:17.726 --> 00:05:21.939
In that case, we'll get a big bonus.

49
00:05:25.818 --> 00:05:31.240
In that case, we'll kill them too.

50
00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:36.203
You two, go check the area.

51
00:05:36.286 --> 00:05:37.371
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!


52
00:05:39.164 --> 00:05:42.251
I want Chusuke to take over the clan.

53
00:05:42.334 --> 00:05:46.922
That old dirty bastard is
driving our clan to destruction.


54
00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:48.132
Watch your mouth!

55
00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.299
But

56
00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:52.094
Right now, focus on defeating Musashi.

57
00:05:56.515 --> 00:05:58.017
Don't you get it?

58
00:05:59.643 --> 00:06:04.606
I have taken a shine to you.

59
00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:07.860
I have great hope for you.

60
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.325
I don't want you
to receive even a scratch

61
00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:16.910
from this fight.

62
00:06:18.704 --> 00:06:22.875
I want to avenge Seijuro,

63
00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:25.627
protect Matashichiro,
and defeat our opponent.


64
00:06:26.545 --> 00:06:31.925
so I can be the new head
of the Yoshioka clan with honor.


65
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.181
I know you have a strong will.

66
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.808
It's time to go.

67
00:06:45.564 --> 00:06:49.234
Let's talk it over somewhere private.

68
00:07:12.675 --> 00:07:16.637
Looks like the clan is over.

69
00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:51.088
Matashichiro!

70
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:52.715
Musashi! How did he get here?

71
00:07:52.798 --> 00:07:54.883
Musashi! He's right there!

72
00:07:54.967 --> 00:07:56.677
Kill him! Don't let him get away!

73
00:07:57.803 --> 00:07:59.972
Kill him at all costs!

74
00:08:00.055 --> 00:08:01.390
Corner him!

75
00:08:04.184 --> 00:08:06.979
Kill him! Musashi, prepare to die!

76
00:08:07.062 --> 00:08:08.480
Kill the bastard!

77
00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:14.445
- Get ready!
- Take him down!


78
00:08:21.493 --> 00:08:22.703
Let's get this started.

79
00:16:09.586 --> 00:16:10.629
Come and get it!

80
00:16:12.715 --> 00:16:13.757
Surround him!

81
00:16:16.176 --> 00:16:17.261
Kill him!

82
00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:18.554
Go! Go!

83
00:20:59.168 --> 00:21:02.379
I'm one of the grandmasters of the clan,
Nanpo Yoichibei.


84
00:21:03.255 --> 00:21:05.841
Musashi, your head is mine!

85
00:22:34.805 --> 00:22:35.889
Take this!

86
00:27:35.773 --> 00:27:37.191
How many more?

87
00:28:02.049 --> 00:28:03.842
Long time, Musashi!

88
00:28:05.302 --> 00:28:06.845
Time to settle the score.

89
00:28:08.263 --> 00:28:09.723
Shishido Baiken

90
00:28:10.516 --> 00:28:12.476
You aren't from the Yoshioka clan!

91
00:28:13.018 --> 00:28:14.311
Who cares?

92
00:28:14.853 --> 00:28:18.357
As long as I
get to kill you, scum!

93
00:28:34.248 --> 00:28:36.291
Musashi!!

94
00:28:59.648 --> 00:29:01.150
- Charge!
- Go!


95
00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:02.151
Get him!

96
00:29:02.818 --> 00:29:03.944
Surround him!

97
00:33:52.775 --> 00:33:53.942
I'll kill them all.

98
00:33:59.865 --> 00:34:01.825
- He's there!
- Over there!


99
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:03.202
This way!

100
00:34:25.516 --> 00:34:26.557
I see him there!

101
00:34:29.311 --> 00:34:31.604
- Over there!
- I found him!


102
00:40:00.184 --> 00:40:01.769
Kill him!

103
00:40:01.852 --> 00:40:03.062
Where the hell is Musashi?

104
00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:05.898
Damn. Find him. He's hiding.

105
00:40:05.981 --> 00:40:07.441
Where did he run to?

106
00:40:08.067 --> 00:40:09.360
Come out, Musashi!

107
00:40:09.443 --> 00:40:10.944
Find him! Find him!

108
00:40:11.028 --> 00:40:12.821
- Musashi!
- Find that bastard!


109
00:40:12.905 --> 00:40:16.408
You're looking pale, coward.
Chickened out?


110
00:40:16.492 --> 00:40:19.536
We can't defeat him.
Let's end this nonsense.


111
00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.497
What did you say?

112
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.623
Nonsense, you said?

113
00:40:24.166 --> 00:40:25.084
Look over there!

114
00:40:25.167 --> 00:40:26.669
Are you really a samurai of the clan?

115
00:40:26.752 --> 00:40:28.837
Killing Musashi won't accomplish anything.

116
00:40:28.921 --> 00:40:30.881
Don't you wanna avenge Seijuro?

117
00:40:30.964 --> 00:40:34.426
How many people
do you think have died for that?


118
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:35.636
What the?!

119
00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:36.887
This madness?

120
00:40:37.554 --> 00:40:40.057
How dare you!

121
00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:48.190
Seijuro taught me
everything I know about the sword.


122
00:40:48.691 --> 00:40:50.275
I've been told that I have a gift.

123
00:40:50.901 --> 00:40:52.695
That's why I'm your superior.

124
00:40:52.778 --> 00:40:53.988
So?

125
00:40:54.071 --> 00:40:54.947
So what?

126
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.990
You!

127
00:40:57.282 --> 00:40:59.868
What were you thinking just now?

128
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.372
Thinking about your wife?

129
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.125
I knew it!

130
00:41:08.252 --> 00:41:10.796
You're a horny coward.

131
00:41:13.966 --> 00:41:15.843
No surprise. Your wife is damn hot.

132
00:41:17.344 --> 00:41:20.180
She has fair and smooth skin

133
00:41:22.057 --> 00:41:23.684
You don't wanna let her go, eh?

134
00:41:27.646 --> 00:41:29.481
Haven's you banged her enough?

135
00:41:32.026 --> 00:41:32.901
What a pig.

136
00:41:33.652 --> 00:41:34.695
Shut your mouth.

137
00:41:34.778 --> 00:41:35.696
No worries.

138
00:41:36.947 --> 00:41:41.452
I'll take good care of your pretty wife
so you can die at ease.


139
00:41:41.535 --> 00:41:43.787
I said shut your mouth!

140
00:41:45.539 --> 00:41:46.582
What's this?

141
00:41:48.292 --> 00:41:49.668
You wanna do this?

142
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:51.920
That'll be fun.

143
00:41:54.048 --> 00:41:55.716
I'll show you what I learned

144
00:41:56.759 --> 00:41:58.469
from the great Seijuro.

145
00:41:59.303 --> 00:42:02.806
I'm also a samurai of the clan.

146
00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.183
Keep barking.

147
00:42:04.892 --> 00:42:08.187
I never liked you anyway.

148
00:42:09.104 --> 00:42:10.230
Perfect timing.

149
00:42:10.856 --> 00:42:12.941
No one will know
if I kill you here.

150
00:42:15.944 --> 00:42:17.154
You ready?

151
00:42:17.237 --> 00:42:18.614
Here I come!

152
00:42:19.948 --> 00:42:21.075
Musashi!

153
00:42:29.667 --> 00:42:30.751
Don't kill me.

154
00:42:32.628 --> 00:42:33.587
Go.

155
00:43:56.045 --> 00:43:57.129
Musashi!

156
00:43:58.964 --> 00:44:03.093
I'll fight you in
the name of the clan!

157
00:44:07.848 --> 00:44:09.224
I am Ueda Ryohei.

158
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:11.685
Here I come!

159
00:44:55.896 --> 00:44:57.773
Sensei! Sensei!

160
00:44:59.108 --> 00:45:00.150
Damn it!

161
00:45:02.486 --> 00:45:03.570
Run! Hurry!

162
00:47:28.257 --> 00:47:30.759
Samurai! He's over here!

163
00:47:32.886 --> 00:47:34.013
There he is!

164
00:47:34.096 --> 00:47:35.556
This way! This way!

165
00:53:26.782 --> 00:53:29.368
How many men do they have?

166
00:53:30.577 --> 00:53:32.287
I thought it would be around 70.

167
00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.290
I feel like I killed more than that.

168
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.093
It's getting tough.

169
00:54:05.321 --> 00:54:06.447
Let's do this.

170
00:54:07.156 --> 00:54:08.615
I'll die one day, anyway.

171
00:54:48.614 --> 00:54:50.074
I am Miyamoto Musashi.

172
00:54:50.741 --> 00:54:51.784
Here I come!

173
01:18:33.163 --> 01:18:34.206
Musashi!

174
01:18:40.671 --> 01:18:42.840
You still want to kill us?

175
01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:47.928
One of the grandmasters

176
01:18:49.638 --> 01:18:50.973
Todo Kenji.

177
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:54.351
I won't let you destroy the clan.

178
01:18:59.231 --> 01:19:00.149
Come.

179
01:21:35.179 --> 01:21:36.638
Not enough!

180
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:07.961
It's cold

181
01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.517
You, die!

182
01:24:27.142 --> 01:24:29.103
Miyamoto Musashi!

183
01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:46.662
Kid who knows nothing of war,
what do you want?


184
01:24:50.332 --> 01:24:51.542
How dare you!

185
01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:05.931
Draw! Draw your sword!

186
01:25:08.726 --> 01:25:11.478
Why did the Yoshioka clan have to be
massacred that day?


187
01:25:12.855 --> 01:25:16.233
Where does your duty lie? Your honor?

188
01:25:17.192 --> 01:25:18.277
Duty?

189
01:25:19.236 --> 01:25:20.321
Honor?

190
01:25:20.863 --> 01:25:22.406
Who gives a crap?

191
01:25:23.782 --> 01:25:25.409
I just wanna win.

192
01:25:27.619 --> 01:25:28.495
Don't retreat!

193
01:25:31.123 --> 01:25:32.249
Aren't you a samurai?

194
01:25:34.626 --> 01:25:35.669
I am a samurai.

195
01:25:38.881 --> 01:25:40.466
So I will kill you!

196
01:25:43.886 --> 01:25:45.054
Come and get it.

197
01:25:46.221 --> 01:25:47.890
Charge!

198
01:26:59.586 --> 01:27:02.089
What are you?

199
01:27:04.883 --> 01:27:06.301
I am

200
01:27:25.132 --> 01:27:30.132
