1
00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.972
It was a long
one today, I'll tell you that.


2
00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:44.638
Mm.

3
00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:46.972
There's cake in the break room.

4
00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.538
Somebody's birthday,
I don't remember who.


5
00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:51.039
It's just one of them
sheet cakes from Kroger,


6
00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:53.406
but, it's pretty good
for a grocery store cake.


7
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.172
You don't really look like
you eat cake, though, do you?


8
00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:00.905
- I eat cake.
- Mm.


9
00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:05.006
You know, my mama always said,
"Never trust a skinny woman.


10
00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:07.206
While we're eating,
they're plotting."


11
00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:10.473
Well, if you eat cake,
how do you stay so little?


12
00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:12.705
You are skin and bones, girl.

13
00:01:15.473 --> 00:01:16.406
Smoking?

14
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.106
Mm-mm, smoking
don't make you thin. I smoke.


15
00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:26.406
You know, I never know
if someone being quiet


16
00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:28.739
is a sign of ain't got
nothing to say,


17
00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:31.505
or they ain't got
nothing going on up here.


18
00:01:34.172 --> 00:01:35.605
You seem to have it
altogether, though.


19
00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:38.473
- Money-wise, I mean.
- How do you know that?


20
00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:41.572
'Cause you come in here
wearing some nice shoes.


21
00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:43.406
I've seen you wearing
those Candies.


22
00:01:43.538 --> 00:01:44.705
Those aren't cheap.

23
00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.272
Well.

24
00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.206
Have a good shift, Mandy.

25
00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:55.672
Hey, Cathy.

26
00:01:56.373 --> 00:01:57.272
Yeah?

27
00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:58.972
Go fuck yourself.

28
00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:18.805
<i>Oh, you're here.</i>

29
00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.839
Okay, I'm very dizzy, okay?

30
00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.638
And I spoke to Karen,
she's not listening to me.


31
00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.239
I need to talk to a doctor
right away.


32
00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:25.905
What if I fall down
and break a hip?


33
00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.772
What if I fall down
and I crack my head


34
00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:30.473
- and get a staph infection?
- Did you check in at this desk?


35
00:02:30.572 --> 00:02:31.473
Yes.

36
00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:33.039
- Mr. Kent...
- Karen.


37
00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:37.306
I told you we will call you
when we have a bed ready.


38
00:02:37.538 --> 00:02:39.006
You need to sit down.

39
00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:42.339
You know, it is hot in here,
so I'm gonna wait outside


40
00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.139
until you're ready.
And it better not rain.


41
00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:48.872
I don't like to be wet.

42
00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.439
You starting now?

43
00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.473
You should know,
you scheduled me.


44
00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:58.239
- Oh, yes.
- I'm about to work a double.


45
00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:01.705
Well, you may wanna
start with 202.


46
00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:04.605
And you should probably go
and get a soda.


47
00:03:04.872 --> 00:03:08.006
I don't drink soda.
Karen, you know that.


48
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:09.939
You got about 30 minutes.

49
00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:06.039
Chug it, chug it, chug.

50
00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:30.473
This is good to go.

51
00:04:31.206 --> 00:04:35.638
Can you believe our insides
look like this?


52
00:04:36.373 --> 00:04:38.106
Like, that's our guts.

53
00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:41.039
Seems to me like it would
all just come


54
00:04:41.172 --> 00:04:42.972
bubbling out of us sometimes.

55
00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:47.006
Like, "Oops, my pancreas
just fell out."


56
00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:48.505
Regina.

57
00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:52.306
- Hmm?
- Give me the money.


58
00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.106
Okay, but first, uh...

59
00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:59.039
let me show you something.
This is what I like to do.


60
00:05:03.672 --> 00:05:08.306
I like to use the soda
to keep 'em extra cold in here.


61
00:05:09.272 --> 00:05:13.172
I always say, "Keeping it cool
is the key to my job."


62
00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:14.272
I made that up.

63
00:05:14.406 --> 00:05:16.473
And then I can drink 'em
when I'm done,


64
00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:18.039
like it's a celebration.

65
00:05:18.206 --> 00:05:22.339
- I really don't care, Regina.
- Look, we're family, right?


66
00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:25.805
I mean, how many cousins
your age you got?


67
00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:27.972
- Cousins by marriage.
- Right.


68
00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:29.939
And who knew we're into
the same stuff?


69
00:05:30.072 --> 00:05:32.172
You know,
the blood and organs and...


70
00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.772
We're not. The money, Regina.

71
00:05:34.905 --> 00:05:38.172
'Cause Nicholas needs
a kidney, like, right now.


72
00:05:38.373 --> 00:05:39.872
But I got held up.

73
00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:41.406
You know Wayne?

74
00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:43.939
He... he needed help
with his science homework.


75
00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:46.739
You know they teach
evolution in fifth grade now?


76
00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.772
- In public school?
- Regina!


77
00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:53.239
Ah. Sorry.

78
00:05:53.505 --> 00:05:55.839
Now, was there a kidney,
in that sack?


79
00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:57.006
Was there?

80
00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.439
I know what a damn kidney
looks like.


81
00:05:59.572 --> 00:06:01.505
Like a bean? Kidney bean?

82
00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:05.572
Jesus. Grumpy ass bitch.

83
00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:26.139
Hey, bitch!

84
00:06:26.538 --> 00:06:28.739
Fuck your mom, asshole.

85
00:06:59.206 --> 00:07:00.206
Are you my mother's nurse?

86
00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:03.972
Was it you who told me that
she was possibly in a coma?


87
00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:06.505
Were you here earlier?

88
00:07:07.172 --> 00:07:08.538
I just got here.

89
00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:10.439
Okay.

90
00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:13.605
Any idea when the results
will be back from her tests?


91
00:07:13.872 --> 00:07:16.072
The doctor won't be back
until tomorrow


92
00:07:16.206 --> 00:07:19.905
- to go over test results.
- But are the test results here?


93
00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:23.705
I... don't see them here, ma'am.

94
00:07:24.172 --> 00:07:26.239
So am I just supposed
to stay here all night?


95
00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:30.972
You don't have to.

96
00:07:31.206 --> 00:07:34.638
I'm sorry.
It's just have a baby at home.


97
00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.939
And I help run my...
my husband's business.


98
00:07:38.072 --> 00:07:40.805
You know the... the Catfish King
over on South Grand?


99
00:07:40.972 --> 00:07:41.705
Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:41.872 --> 00:07:43.439
It's just I feel so guilty
not staying


101
00:07:43.572 --> 00:07:45.473
in case she wakes up.
She might be confused.


102
00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:47.905
She's got dementia
or Alzheimer's


103
00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:49.972
or whatever they're calling it
these days.


104
00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:51.705
If she doesn't know
where she is, she can be...


105
00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:53.605
she can be real difficult
and she's...


106
00:07:53.805 --> 00:07:55.473
she's very strong and...

107
00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:57.972
Is that your mother's
overnight bag?


108
00:07:58.306 --> 00:07:59.739
Some of her personal things.

109
00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:02.039
I grabbed real quickly.

110
00:08:02.972 --> 00:08:07.605
You know, I just love
that Catfish King.


111
00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:11.039
Mm! I love those hush puppies.

112
00:08:12.905 --> 00:08:14.872
- Still pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.


113
00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:16.006
But don't you worry,

114
00:08:16.206 --> 00:08:18.239
the good Lord will be
with your mama all night.


115
00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:20.006
Promise you that.

116
00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:38.638
No.

117
00:08:51.872 --> 00:08:53.572
Ain't no way you're waking up.

118
00:08:55.538 --> 00:08:57.172
Room 218 needs cleaning.

119
00:08:57.473 --> 00:08:58.672
I already cleaned it.

120
00:08:58.972 --> 00:08:59.905
He pissed the bed.

121
00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:03.406
He urinated a moment ago.
That's why I cleaned it.


122
00:09:03.672 --> 00:09:05.939
Dorothy, clean the sheets.

123
00:09:21.373 --> 00:09:23.505
- What is that about?
- State Pen.


124
00:09:23.672 --> 00:09:25.538
Tried to kill himself.
He'll make it, though.


125
00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:26.839
Poor thing.

126
00:09:27.439 --> 00:09:28.739
They gotta leave him
handcuffed to the bed


127
00:09:28.872 --> 00:09:29.872
even though he's passed out?

128
00:09:30.106 --> 00:09:32.538
He murdered someone.
Don't you read the paper?


129
00:09:35.638 --> 00:09:36.638
She only reads the Bible.

130
00:09:36.905 --> 00:09:38.538
And those Good News bulletins
that folks leave


131
00:09:38.672 --> 00:09:40.605
on your front porch
when you don't answer the door.


132
00:09:42.473 --> 00:09:43.439
Okay.

133
00:09:43.572 --> 00:09:45.939
Emergency dialysis.

134
00:09:46.072 --> 00:09:48.106
Three times in a month.
That's you.


135
00:09:48.473 --> 00:09:49.572
Mr. Collins?

136
00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:52.572
Yep, but not critical,
so just prioritize.


137
00:09:56.006 --> 00:09:57.373
<i>I don't like this room.</i>

138
00:09:57.939 --> 00:09:59.505
You hear me?

139
00:10:00.139 --> 00:10:01.106
I said I don't like it.

140
00:10:01.306 --> 00:10:04.239
You can leave when you're done
with your dialysis.


141
00:10:05.006 --> 00:10:08.605
Sad sweat.
That's what it smells like.


142
00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:13.172
You ever smelled sadness?

143
00:10:14.272 --> 00:10:17.572
Only every day.

144
00:10:19.106 --> 00:10:21.672
You know, they only gave me
three months.


145
00:10:21.905 --> 00:10:24.772
Two and a half now, maybe.

146
00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:28.972
I'm here half the damn time.
I do wanna go home, though.


147
00:10:31.206 --> 00:10:32.538
You turn on that TV?

148
00:10:34.306 --> 00:10:35.239
Sure.

149
00:10:37.638 --> 00:10:39.239
<i>My husband likes a clean car,</i>

150
00:10:39.373 --> 00:10:40.473
<i>what can I say?</i>

151
00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:42.406
<i>Well, you know what they say</i>

152
00:10:42.538 --> 00:10:44.905
<i>about Arkansas,
if you don't like the weather,</i>


153
00:10:45.206 --> 00:10:45.972
<i>just wait a minute.</i>

154
00:10:46.106 --> 00:10:47.939
<i>My grandma did always say that.</i>

155
00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:49.339
<i>Mine too.</i>

156
00:10:49.473 --> 00:10:51.505
<i>Well, thanks
for the weather update, Wendy.</i>


157
00:10:51.605 --> 00:10:54.172
<i>Let's get back to the real news
of this evening.</i>


158
00:10:54.572 --> 00:10:56.473
<i>The local Eighth Grade
Science Fair.</i>


159
00:10:56.605 --> 00:10:57.972
<i>Now, these kids show
some real aptitude.</i>


160
00:10:58.106 --> 00:11:00.572
You know...

161
00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:05.505
...sad thing about dying is that
the minutes really slow down.


162
00:11:06.172 --> 00:11:08.572
You forgot to appreciate
all those other minutes


163
00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:11.638
and all you got are these
shitty ones.


164
00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:16.805
Hey, Mandy, they're bringing in
an OD, and I'm too busy.


165
00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:18.439
They could use some extra hands.

166
00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:25.072
Shit.

167
00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:39.739
Hey, male, 30s.
OD'd, no identification.


168
00:11:39.905 --> 00:11:41.672
Found at a motel.
Heart rate is 38.


169
00:11:41.805 --> 00:11:44.106
Respiratory rate, critical.
Administered Narcan.


170
00:11:45.406 --> 00:11:46.306
What?

171
00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:48.972
- Nothing.
- You know him?


172
00:11:49.139 --> 00:11:50.638
Uh. Sort of.

173
00:11:50.805 --> 00:11:52.272
Okay. He needs his whole
system flushed.


174
00:11:52.439 --> 00:11:53.572
Okay.

175
00:11:54.272 --> 00:11:56.139
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.


176
00:11:56.638 --> 00:11:58.739
Oh, shit, he's having a seizure.

177
00:11:59.705 --> 00:12:01.705
Code blue,
someone get a line set up.


178
00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:03.772
Oxygen's going down, code blue.

179
00:12:32.439 --> 00:12:33.538
You're late.

180
00:12:39.306 --> 00:12:42.139
But there's nothing I like
better than cash in my hand.


181
00:12:42.473 --> 00:12:46.672
There's a few things I like
a lot more than cash in my hand.


182
00:12:47.439 --> 00:12:48.638
Me too, actually.

183
00:12:49.473 --> 00:12:50.672
Or maybe not.

184
00:12:53.672 --> 00:12:55.306
202 is too tricky.

185
00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:59.106
I have another idea.
Mr. Collins. Dialysis.


186
00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:02.206
Just gotta keep
prying eyes away.


187
00:13:02.805 --> 00:13:05.206
Well, look at you
taking initiative.


188
00:13:06.206 --> 00:13:07.705
I like my initiative too.

189
00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:10.739
Well, I guess I could have
your crazy ass cousin


190
00:13:10.872 --> 00:13:12.239
do another pickup tomorrow.

191
00:13:12.638 --> 00:13:15.638
That girl is not my cousin.

192
00:13:17.805 --> 00:13:19.239
You better tell her that.

193
00:15:14.972 --> 00:15:16.905
Regina, where the fuck
have you been?


194
00:15:17.072 --> 00:15:19.605
Geez, Nick,
I told you I was running late.


195
00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:22.106
I reckoned you guys
would be in here playing poker


196
00:15:22.272 --> 00:15:24.605
- or whatever you do.
- Nah, I already won.


197
00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:27.006
Yeah, that shit ended hours ago.
You...


198
00:15:27.672 --> 00:15:30.839
- kept me waiting.
- Geez, sorry.


199
00:15:30.972 --> 00:15:32.139
I came right here.

200
00:15:33.638 --> 00:15:35.139
- Our cousin said...
- Our cousin?


201
00:15:35.473 --> 00:15:39.206
No, no, you're my cousin.
She's your cousin.


202
00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:41.239
And she's your cousin
by marriage.


203
00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:45.473
Mm-hmm. And that makes her
your cousin too.


204
00:15:45.638 --> 00:15:47.272
Regina,
that's not how family works.


205
00:15:49.272 --> 00:15:50.505
What's happening to her?

206
00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:52.339
She's getting her
belly button pierced.


207
00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:53.739
Stop moving, it'll hurt less.

208
00:15:54.006 --> 00:15:55.638
Uh. Mikey,
get her a drink, okay?


209
00:15:55.772 --> 00:15:57.373
It don't look like
she likes it much.


210
00:15:57.538 --> 00:15:59.538
And how is that any
of your fucking business?


211
00:16:00.473 --> 00:16:02.872
Mandy said one of those things
is a kidney.


212
00:16:03.106 --> 00:16:05.072
"One of those things"?
You don't recognize a kidney?


213
00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:07.605
Telling you, public school here
is a lot of...


214
00:16:09.406 --> 00:16:10.905
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh.


215
00:16:11.538 --> 00:16:14.006
I use those to keep it
a little bit cooler.


216
00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:15.373
You know, I always say,

217
00:16:15.672 --> 00:16:17.972
"Part of my job
is to keep things cool."


218
00:16:18.106 --> 00:16:20.139
That's sweet,
but where are my fucking organs?


219
00:16:20.473 --> 00:16:22.505
Uh. Under the drinks.

220
00:16:22.638 --> 00:16:24.172
No, no, there's nothing here.

221
00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:28.872
- Is this a fucking joke?
- No, no joke.


222
00:16:29.006 --> 00:16:31.939
Uh. I... I don't know.
Let me check my car.


223
00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:34.406
Regina, I...
I realize you're new here.


224
00:16:34.505 --> 00:16:36.072
You've been with us,
what, a couple of weeks?


225
00:16:36.206 --> 00:16:37.306
- A month.
- Okay.


226
00:16:37.439 --> 00:16:39.406
But your sole purpose
is to bring me


227
00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:41.006
the fucking organs.

228
00:16:41.206 --> 00:16:42.505
I'm sure I left them in my car.

229
00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:45.106
I need the fucking organs
right fucking now!


230
00:16:45.605 --> 00:16:48.206
I've got a guy who needs
an organ tonight.


231
00:16:48.473 --> 00:16:50.206
An important guy,
more important than...


232
00:16:50.538 --> 00:16:51.805
than my cousin.

233
00:16:52.139 --> 00:16:53.139
You had one job to do

234
00:16:53.272 --> 00:16:55.739
and that was to bring me
the kidney from the hospital.


235
00:16:55.872 --> 00:16:57.939
It's really...
it's really very simple.


236
00:16:58.206 --> 00:16:58.905
I know.

237
00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:00.538
This is an emergency, Regina.

238
00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:02.172
Shut up!

239
00:17:04.572 --> 00:17:06.605
- I... I'll check my car.
- You do that.


240
00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:08.905
And if it ain't out there,
I can think of another place


241
00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:11.373
where we can find ourselves
a kidney.


242
00:17:13.373 --> 00:17:14.972
Maybe that's
what you're good for.


243
00:17:15.605 --> 00:17:18.505
- Parts.
- I... I'll check my car.


244
00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:28.638
- Somebody get this.
- Somebody come get this.


245
00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:37.538
Shit. Shit.

246
00:17:57.505 --> 00:17:59.972
It's at the hospital.
I'll be right back.


247
00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:02.672
It takes 30 minutes
to get there.


248
00:18:03.239 --> 00:18:06.805
She's not back in an hour,
drag her back by the hair.


249
00:18:08.172 --> 00:18:09.106
Can do.

250
00:18:24.905 --> 00:18:28.172
Hey, will you turn it up?
I wanna know if it's gonna rain.


251
00:18:30.805 --> 00:18:31.705
You deaf?

252
00:18:34.872 --> 00:18:36.772
You know, it's Karen's birthday
next week.


253
00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:38.406
You gonna pitch in for flowers?

254
00:18:38.538 --> 00:18:39.638
We're all chipping
in three bucks.


255
00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:42.638
- Probably not.
- Everybody's doing it.


256
00:18:44.705 --> 00:18:46.272
When are you done
with your probation?


257
00:18:48.072 --> 00:18:48.972
Bite me.

258
00:18:51.705 --> 00:18:54.705
Hey, EMT Derrick said you knew
that trash OD downstairs.


259
00:18:54.839 --> 00:18:56.006
Who is he?

260
00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:00.705
Bitch.

261
00:19:03.972 --> 00:19:05.605
<i>Hoppity the Bunny
is what his name is,</i>


262
00:19:05.805 --> 00:19:08.572
<i>and that Beanie Baby sold
for over 500 dollars</i>


263
00:19:08.705 --> 00:19:09.605
<i>right here in town.</i>

264
00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:11.439
<i>Wow, better stock up on those.</i>

265
00:19:11.672 --> 00:19:13.473
<i>Our top story this evening
is the police force</i>


266
00:19:13.638 --> 00:19:15.505
<i>Y2K Preparation Convention.</i>

267
00:19:15.705 --> 00:19:17.473
<i>Looks like our whole force
is out there.</i>


268
00:19:17.638 --> 00:19:18.772
<i>That and then some.</i>

269
00:19:18.939 --> 00:19:20.839
<i>Tonight began the first night
of a three...</i>


270
00:19:25.106 --> 00:19:29.039
Don't tell the next shift yet.
Maybe not Mr. Collins.


271
00:19:29.638 --> 00:19:32.972
I like him.
I wanna think of someone else.


272
00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:36.805
- What about that prisoner?
- He has a guard.


273
00:19:37.473 --> 00:19:38.972
I ain't scared of that.

274
00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:43.172
Well, he is gonna get the chair.

275
00:19:46.638 --> 00:19:48.072
I guess that could work.

276
00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.939
- It your birthday next week?
- Yeah.


277
00:19:53.406 --> 00:19:54.905
They getting me
some flowers or some shit?


278
00:19:55.306 --> 00:19:57.672
- Yeah.
- That's depressing.


279
00:19:59.739 --> 00:20:00.638
Okay.

280
00:20:18.905 --> 00:20:21.605
- Ma'am.
- Just checking in.


281
00:20:24.272 --> 00:20:27.605
- You here all night?
- Uh. Unfortunately so, ma'am.


282
00:20:32.538 --> 00:20:35.072
How's he doing?

283
00:20:35.672 --> 00:20:38.039
- You're the expert.
- Hmm.


284
00:20:39.106 --> 00:20:40.739
Do you need anything?

285
00:20:42.972 --> 00:20:45.772
- I could use a coffee.
- You know, I'm not allowed


286
00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:46.972
to do that for you.

287
00:20:47.306 --> 00:20:49.839
But I could watch him
for a while if you wanna go


288
00:20:49.939 --> 00:20:51.039
grab one. Go on.

289
00:20:51.272 --> 00:20:53.206
They don't... they don't want me
to leave his side.


290
00:20:53.439 --> 00:20:57.172
Oh, he is not going anywhere.

291
00:20:57.473 --> 00:20:59.239
Yeah.

292
00:20:59.638 --> 00:21:01.805
Thanks, but, rules are rules.

293
00:21:07.373 --> 00:21:10.939
Get me some goddamn drugs.

294
00:21:16.106 --> 00:21:17.839
I'll see if I can get you
that coffee.


295
00:21:31.072 --> 00:21:33.739
How you feeling today?

296
00:21:43.272 --> 00:21:44.972
- Did you find that coffee?
- Nope.


297
00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:59.905
We made a mistake.

298
00:22:00.939 --> 00:22:02.505
What the fuck
are you doing here?


299
00:22:02.705 --> 00:22:05.805
- Whoa, is that Andrew?
- What mistake?


300
00:22:06.106 --> 00:22:07.106
He OD?

301
00:22:07.605 --> 00:22:09.106
What's it about this family
that makes you guys


302
00:22:09.239 --> 00:22:12.939
all into junkies, huh?
Must be your daddy or something.


303
00:22:18.373 --> 00:22:19.473
Is Andrew gonna die?

304
00:22:19.605 --> 00:22:21.406
- I never liked...
- There is a reason


305
00:22:21.538 --> 00:22:24.339
we meet down
by the soda machine, Regina.


306
00:22:24.605 --> 00:22:25.605
You can't be seen here.

307
00:22:25.805 --> 00:22:27.473
I didn't want
to come in here, okay?


308
00:22:27.672 --> 00:22:29.839
You know, surrounded
by all these dying people.


309
00:22:30.439 --> 00:22:33.872
This is how you get one of those
flesh-eating bacteria diseases


310
00:22:34.006 --> 00:22:34.939
like they got on TV.

311
00:22:35.272 --> 00:22:37.538
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, you think it's an itch?


312
00:22:37.839 --> 00:22:39.638
And...
and then you scratch it...


313
00:22:40.306 --> 00:22:42.272
and your whole face
comes right off.


314
00:22:42.839 --> 00:22:44.805
And it always begins
in a hospital.


315
00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:48.272
- Why are you here?
- We fucked up.


316
00:22:49.672 --> 00:22:51.972
- Shit.
- Told you that it wasn't here.


317
00:22:52.306 --> 00:22:53.505
Well, where the hell is it?

318
00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:54.939
I don't know.

319
00:22:55.538 --> 00:22:57.306
I don't know,
I... I don't know. I... I...


320
00:22:57.473 --> 00:22:59.106
Maybe you lost it
on the way there.


321
00:22:59.239 --> 00:23:01.905
I didn't touch the cooler
between here and the warehouse.


322
00:23:02.139 --> 00:23:04.739
I checked my car.
I checked everywhere.


323
00:23:04.872 --> 00:23:08.772
Look, if it's not here,
there is nothing I can do.


324
00:23:09.339 --> 00:23:11.072
- We are laying low.
- Look...


325
00:23:11.805 --> 00:23:13.072
I'm a little bit desperate here.

326
00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:16.505
Nicholas is gonna have my ass
if I don't bring him a kidney.


327
00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:19.939
Maybe more than my ass. He...
he is gonna take my kidney.


328
00:23:20.206 --> 00:23:23.505
He said so. How many...
how many do I need to live?


329
00:23:23.772 --> 00:23:26.373
- One.
- How many was I born with?


330
00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:28.972
- Two.
- That's not too bad.


331
00:23:29.306 --> 00:23:30.772
Look... Mm-mm.

332
00:23:34.373 --> 00:23:35.905
I don't wanna point
fingers at you.


333
00:23:36.039 --> 00:23:39.106
It's your job to make sure
I get the package securely.


334
00:23:39.239 --> 00:23:42.039
And apparently, I didn't.
Just help me out.


335
00:23:42.172 --> 00:23:42.872
Regina.

336
00:23:43.072 --> 00:23:44.972
Why, just explain it to me.

337
00:23:45.106 --> 00:23:48.739
- How do you murder people?
- I don't murder them.


338
00:23:49.006 --> 00:23:50.905
It's killing someone.

339
00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:53.638
That's murder,
whatever you do to them.


340
00:23:53.705 --> 00:23:55.672
I don't know what you do,
but how... how do you do it?


341
00:23:55.805 --> 00:23:58.872
- Mandy, just tell me. Come on.
- Bleach.


342
00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:03.772
- I use bleach.
- Hmm. And then you wait?


343
00:24:03.972 --> 00:24:07.272
Someone else does the removals
on the next shift.


344
00:24:07.572 --> 00:24:08.805
I don't even know who.

345
00:24:08.939 --> 00:24:10.872
Maybe you know
how to do it right.


346
00:24:12.473 --> 00:24:15.039
You went to school, you know...
you know what thing sits where,


347
00:24:15.172 --> 00:24:17.739
- whatever it sits in there.
- Yes, I know how to do it.


348
00:24:18.006 --> 00:24:20.239
So you could do it all,
you could do it real fast.


349
00:24:20.872 --> 00:24:24.972
- Like, all in one night.
- No. It's too hard.


350
00:24:25.572 --> 00:24:28.473
- Uh-huh.
- Mandy, help me, please?


351
00:24:28.605 --> 00:24:29.905
I'm fucked.

352
00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:33.739
Regina, you lost thousands
of dollars worth of organs.


353
00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:37.605
- What about Andrew?
- What about Andrew?


354
00:24:37.905 --> 00:24:40.805
I mean, is he gonna
make it outta here alive?


355
00:24:41.373 --> 00:24:42.872
- Yeah.
- Really?


356
00:24:43.172 --> 00:24:44.272
He didn't look too good.

357
00:24:45.972 --> 00:24:48.638
You never really liked him,
right?


358
00:24:49.306 --> 00:24:52.805
I... I know he's family too,
but...


359
00:24:53.505 --> 00:24:55.106
not like you and me.

360
00:24:55.473 --> 00:24:57.239
I never did like him

361
00:24:57.572 --> 00:25:00.072
when it all came out
that he did that...


362
00:25:00.638 --> 00:25:03.473
that awful stuff
to you when you was kids...


363
00:25:03.638 --> 00:25:04.939
Shut it.

364
00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:10.006
Don't you dare go in that room.
Get the fuck out of here.


365
00:25:10.206 --> 00:25:11.572
Do you understand me?

366
00:25:14.872 --> 00:25:17.572
You are gonna have to solve
this problem by yourself.


367
00:25:17.705 --> 00:25:19.272
Yes.

368
00:25:19.406 --> 00:25:21.605
Mandy?

369
00:25:22.172 --> 00:25:25.373
Is it 'cause I said
all that stuff, about Andrew...


370
00:25:25.972 --> 00:25:28.006
about your fucked up childhood?

371
00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:19.905
Well, look at you.

372
00:26:21.939 --> 00:26:22.972
Mm-hmm.

373
00:26:25.672 --> 00:26:27.672
How dead are you?

374
00:26:49.072 --> 00:26:50.705
<i>This is Wendy with the weather.</i>

375
00:26:51.039 --> 00:26:53.638
<i>That big storm looks like
it's coming in tonight.</i>


376
00:26:53.872 --> 00:26:56.072
<i>Straight from the north
and hitting us right here</i>


377
00:26:56.206 --> 00:27:00.106
<i>in Northeast Arkansas,
and it is gonna be a wet one.</i>


378
00:27:00.505 --> 00:27:02.272
<i>Tune in here
for flash flood warnings.</i>


379
00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:03.272
<i>Remember the basics.</i>

380
00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:05.605
- Close the windows to your car?
- Why?


381
00:27:06.505 --> 00:27:07.605
It's gonna rain.

382
00:27:08.638 --> 00:27:11.039
I don't leave the windows
to my car open.


383
00:27:11.239 --> 00:27:12.406
Then they're closed.

384
00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:15.339
<i>High humidity of 87 today.</i>

385
00:27:15.473 --> 00:27:16.939
Get that package out all right?

386
00:27:18.306 --> 00:27:19.505
Yep.

387
00:27:20.406 --> 00:27:22.772
And the other?

388
00:27:23.373 --> 00:27:24.739
I'll keep you updated.

389
00:27:25.172 --> 00:27:27.705
<i>Next week,
we got another hot one for you.</i>


390
00:27:28.373 --> 00:27:31.306
- This is a nasty ass cake.
- Yeah.


391
00:27:31.605 --> 00:27:32.939
They always get...

392
00:27:34.039 --> 00:27:35.072
gross cake.

393
00:27:35.772 --> 00:27:37.705
<i>Stay tuned</i>
<i>next for</i> American Life.


394
00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:51.672
Oh.

395
00:27:52.272 --> 00:27:53.505
Thank you.

396
00:27:58.139 --> 00:27:59.805
Guess I fell asleep.

397
00:28:01.106 --> 00:28:03.572
It's easy to get
tired on these night shifts.


398
00:28:03.872 --> 00:28:04.839
Mm.

399
00:28:09.772 --> 00:28:14.172
- You, uh, work for the prison?
- Nah, I'm just hired security.


400
00:28:14.905 --> 00:28:16.172
They don't even give me a gun.

401
00:28:18.373 --> 00:28:19.339
I mean, not that...

402
00:28:19.805 --> 00:28:21.206
not that I need one.

403
00:28:26.139 --> 00:28:27.139
I do parties.

404
00:28:28.872 --> 00:28:31.672
And nightclubs too.
And sometimes, I do the...


405
00:28:32.072 --> 00:28:34.439
do the show circuit,
the stadium shows.


406
00:28:34.739 --> 00:28:36.072
I just did a Marilyn Manson...

407
00:28:37.072 --> 00:28:38.206
show. Do you like them?

408
00:28:38.805 --> 00:28:41.972
- Mm. No.
- No, yeah. Just a bunch of...


409
00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:44.739
long-haired
vampire-looking kids,


410
00:28:44.872 --> 00:28:46.339
but it was... it was cool.

411
00:28:47.006 --> 00:28:49.605
Yeah, that guitarist used to be
on <i>The Wonder Years.</i>


412
00:28:49.905 --> 00:28:51.406
Yeah, he got one of his ribs
taken out


413
00:28:51.538 --> 00:28:54.805
so he could suck his own dick.
Yeah.


414
00:28:55.805 --> 00:28:56.805
Uh...

415
00:29:02.406 --> 00:29:03.306
Hey.

416
00:29:03.905 --> 00:29:06.039
- Hi!
- You here for his blood work?


417
00:29:06.172 --> 00:29:07.272
Uh-huh, yep, mm-hmm.

418
00:29:07.439 --> 00:29:08.638
He's probably gonna be
a vegetable.


419
00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:10.605
It's a waste, he's pretty cute.

420
00:29:10.772 --> 00:29:12.805
Maybe he's an asshole
in real life.


421
00:29:13.206 --> 00:29:14.306
Cute ones always are.

422
00:29:15.072 --> 00:29:17.939
Excuse me.
Could you direct me to room 222?


423
00:29:18.072 --> 00:29:19.072
I keep getting lost.

424
00:29:22.039 --> 00:29:23.272
I'm busy.

425
00:29:23.872 --> 00:29:27.239
- It's just around the corner.
- Well, I can't seem to find it.


426
00:29:28.406 --> 00:29:29.572
Then I guess...

427
00:29:30.306 --> 00:29:31.538
I'll show you.

428
00:29:32.206 --> 00:29:33.206
You will.

429
00:29:41.006 --> 00:29:43.139
Just keep going.
It's on this floor.


430
00:29:48.939 --> 00:29:52.406
- You are not very helpful.
- I'm busy, can't you see that?


431
00:29:52.572 --> 00:29:54.605
Well, I need to know
where I'm going...


432
00:29:54.739 --> 00:29:57.306
I'm like the other nurse.
You know, I'm also busy.


433
00:29:57.473 --> 00:29:58.638
This is my patient.

434
00:29:58.872 --> 00:30:03.605
Mrs. Eliza Patrick.
And Mrs. Patrick needs me.


435
00:30:03.772 --> 00:30:05.039
Who is your supervisor?

436
00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:07.039
I'm sorry, I don't have time
to talk to you.


437
00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:08.572
Who is your supervisor?

438
00:30:08.705 --> 00:30:10.672
I want to tell them about
your poor customer service.


439
00:30:10.805 --> 00:30:12.572
You're the one
who can't find her way around


440
00:30:12.672 --> 00:30:14.373
one story of a building.

441
00:30:14.605 --> 00:30:16.239
I'm gonna tell
everyone about that.


442
00:30:17.072 --> 00:30:18.473
Are you my nurse?

443
00:30:18.772 --> 00:30:21.572
- Yes, ma'am, I am.
- I need to get up for a bit.


444
00:30:21.705 --> 00:30:23.872
Nah. I think that's a bad idea.

445
00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:25.439
<i>Nurse!</i>

446
00:30:26.172 --> 00:30:28.672
- <i>Can I get a nurse in here?</i>
- Where are you going?


447
00:30:28.905 --> 00:30:30.272
To help this screaming man.

448
00:30:30.439 --> 00:30:32.006
- <i>Nurse?</i>
- What is your name?


449
00:30:32.139 --> 00:30:33.072
Mandy.

450
00:30:33.939 --> 00:30:36.272
Well, I'm gonna report you,
Mandy!


451
00:30:40.905 --> 00:30:42.339
I think I must be done.

452
00:30:43.272 --> 00:30:47.638
- Been here for over two hours.
- Probably so, then.


453
00:30:50.739 --> 00:30:52.805
What's happening to you in here?

454
00:30:53.006 --> 00:30:53.905
What?

455
00:30:55.872 --> 00:30:58.306
Dialysis.

456
00:30:58.805 --> 00:31:01.939
- Are you a nurse or what?
- Obviously.


457
00:31:03.339 --> 00:31:05.006
Look at my outfit.

458
00:31:05.605 --> 00:31:07.039
Could you turn that TV up?

459
00:31:07.172 --> 00:31:08.505
Can't hear anything.

460
00:31:13.039 --> 00:31:14.039
What happened?

461
00:31:14.805 --> 00:31:17.538
She tried to stand.
I saw her from the hallway.


462
00:31:17.805 --> 00:31:19.439
I didn't think she'd wake up.

463
00:31:19.705 --> 00:31:22.206
- She's stronger than she looks.
- Mrs. Patrick?


464
00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:23.805
Your daughter just stepped out.

465
00:31:23.939 --> 00:31:25.939
We need to get you
back in the bed, okay?


466
00:31:26.172 --> 00:31:26.939
Where is she?

467
00:31:27.306 --> 00:31:29.872
Call her daughter, please,
and tell her she's awake.


468
00:31:30.272 --> 00:31:31.206
Come on now.

469
00:31:33.538 --> 00:31:35.139
- That's right.
- Up we go.


470
00:31:40.339 --> 00:31:41.605
Where is Shawna?

471
00:31:42.439 --> 00:31:46.339
Mrs. Patrick. Eliza.
Listen to me, okay?


472
00:31:46.605 --> 00:31:48.139
We're here to take care of you.

473
00:31:52.872 --> 00:31:54.905
- Stay here a minute, will you?
- Okay.


474
00:32:10.473 --> 00:32:11.839
Shit.

475
00:32:15.072 --> 00:32:16.139
What the fuck?

476
00:32:16.872 --> 00:32:19.805
- It's bleach.
- Oh, my sweet Jesus.


477
00:32:20.006 --> 00:32:21.106
Did you say bleach?

478
00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:23.805
- Mr. Collins?
- He's gone.


479
00:32:25.473 --> 00:32:28.072
Oh, no! Oh!

480
00:32:28.473 --> 00:32:29.672
What the fuck happened to him?

481
00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:31.572
- I don't know.
- Have you lost your damn mind?


482
00:32:31.672 --> 00:32:32.772
I can't cover
something like this.


483
00:32:32.839 --> 00:32:35.106
- No. Dammit. It wasn't me.
- You sure?


484
00:32:35.439 --> 00:32:36.605
Yes.

485
00:32:36.805 --> 00:32:39.039
- Somebody call the cops?
- Yep.


486
00:32:39.373 --> 00:32:40.538
Damn!

487
00:32:45.139 --> 00:32:46.739
- You going home?
- They told me to wait


488
00:32:46.805 --> 00:32:48.006
and give a statement.

489
00:32:48.872 --> 00:32:52.538
- We are fucked.
- I know, Karen.


490
00:32:56.206 --> 00:32:58.772
This is gonna set us way back.

491
00:32:58.905 --> 00:33:00.439
We can't do anything
for weeks now.


492
00:33:00.872 --> 00:33:03.538
Do you think I don't fucking
know that, Karen? Damn.


493
00:33:03.672 --> 00:33:05.239
Well, if you didn't do it,
who did?


494
00:33:07.339 --> 00:33:09.306
You know,
he was really depressed.


495
00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:11.272
Ain't nobody drinking bleach,
Mandy.


496
00:33:11.439 --> 00:33:15.272
Then I don't know.

497
00:33:16.538 --> 00:33:18.039
Is there any more cake?

498
00:33:20.206 --> 00:33:21.638
- What?
- Oh, my God.


499
00:33:22.272 --> 00:33:23.505
Wha...

500
00:33:24.638 --> 00:33:26.072
Oh, good.

501
00:33:36.605 --> 00:33:38.872
Oh, goddammit. What the fuck
are you doing here?


502
00:33:39.006 --> 00:33:40.905
Why are you wearing that?

503
00:33:41.172 --> 00:33:42.473
This is not funny, Regina.

504
00:33:42.605 --> 00:33:44.072
You need to get
the fuck outta here.


505
00:33:44.206 --> 00:33:45.473
We just had an a...

506
00:33:50.072 --> 00:33:51.139
What did you do?

507
00:33:52.538 --> 00:33:57.772
- Uh... Well, I was...
- What the hell did you do?


508
00:33:58.306 --> 00:34:00.505
Nothing,
I was just helping you out.


509
00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:06.039
Did you pour bleach
down that man's throat?


510
00:34:07.306 --> 00:34:08.538
Yeah.

511
00:34:09.206 --> 00:34:11.139
I just did what you do.

512
00:34:11.672 --> 00:34:14.705
- That is not what I do.
- Hmm?


513
00:34:15.772 --> 00:34:19.206
Why, I need that man's kidney.
I need it tonight.


514
00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.439
Just give it to me
and I'll leave.


515
00:34:21.872 --> 00:34:23.439
I'll go, you won't ever see
me again.


516
00:34:23.572 --> 00:34:24.739
Oh, my God.

517
00:34:27.638 --> 00:34:28.939
You're so stupid.

518
00:34:29.805 --> 00:34:33.805
You are such a stupid bitch.

519
00:34:34.473 --> 00:34:35.572
Excuse me?

520
00:34:36.439 --> 00:34:39.538
- Fuck you.
- You are so dumb.


521
00:34:40.805 --> 00:34:42.939
Do you know what dialysis is?

522
00:34:43.505 --> 00:34:45.306
Mr. Collins was on dialysis

523
00:34:45.473 --> 00:34:47.373
because his kidneys
are so shitty


524
00:34:47.505 --> 00:34:49.072
he can't flush out
his own system.


525
00:34:49.206 --> 00:34:52.239
So even if I was stupid enough
to help you,


526
00:34:52.572 --> 00:34:54.373
that man's kidneys are useless.

527
00:34:54.972 --> 00:34:57.839
You killed an innocent man
for no reason.


528
00:34:58.339 --> 00:34:59.772
Do you understand that?

529
00:35:02.805 --> 00:35:05.039
I'm not leaving
till you give me a kidney.


530
00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:06.872
You are gonna leave.

531
00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:09.139
And you are gonna leave
right now.


532
00:35:10.006 --> 00:35:13.206
The cops are coming here.
And when they get here,


533
00:35:13.505 --> 00:35:16.006
I'm gonna tell them
who did this shit,


534
00:35:16.572 --> 00:35:18.339
the girl posing as a nurse

535
00:35:18.705 --> 00:35:21.206
standing in the storage room
like an idiot.


536
00:35:22.306 --> 00:35:24.039
You wouldn't turn on me
like that.


537
00:35:24.339 --> 00:35:26.139
You brought me
into this whole thing.


538
00:35:27.106 --> 00:35:28.739
Oh, like hell I wouldn't.

539
00:35:29.572 --> 00:35:31.672
Then I'll tell them everything.

540
00:35:32.306 --> 00:35:34.505
All the bad stuff about you...

541
00:35:35.538 --> 00:35:37.139
about your little operation.

542
00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:40.538
Hell, about all the drugs
you do in here.


543
00:35:44.072 --> 00:35:46.672
If I leave here
without a kidney...


544
00:35:47.473 --> 00:35:48.638
I'm dead.

545
00:36:08.939 --> 00:36:10.739
What happened to this guy?

546
00:36:11.072 --> 00:36:12.206
Alcohol and morphine.

547
00:36:13.306 --> 00:36:14.939
- Is he dead?
- No.


548
00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:17.538
Whoa.

549
00:36:17.939 --> 00:36:20.106
Is this, like, a prisoner
or something?


550
00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:21.538
Mm, he's perfect.

551
00:36:21.672 --> 00:36:23.439
Just bleach him
and take his kidney.


552
00:36:23.872 --> 00:36:26.705
Probably deserves it.
What did he do?


553
00:36:27.172 --> 00:36:28.505
Haven't you heard?

554
00:36:29.505 --> 00:36:31.872
Murder. I murdered a cop.

555
00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:33.605
I hate cops...

556
00:36:34.972 --> 00:36:36.672
but I love blondes.

557
00:36:40.039 --> 00:36:42.672
- We didn't know you were awake.
- Come on.


558
00:36:42.905 --> 00:36:46.772
Take one of my kidneys,
and I'll take one of yours.


559
00:36:47.106 --> 00:36:48.072
Fuck.

560
00:36:48.705 --> 00:36:50.239
Hey, you ever do it
on someone who's awake?


561
00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:51.872
I... I mean,
he could still work.


562
00:36:52.139 --> 00:36:53.839
No, stop trying to help.

563
00:36:55.473 --> 00:36:56.672
Give me an hour, wait outside.

564
00:36:56.972 --> 00:36:58.839
Okay, fine,
but we have to hurry.


565
00:36:59.072 --> 00:37:00.106
An hour.

566
00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:23.905
Lucky you got family checks
on you.


567
00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:46.739
I could've used this tonight.
Hope you enjoy it.


568
00:38:01.439 --> 00:38:03.505
Mandy, you're next.
He needs a statement.


569
00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:05.972
- I was just, uh...
- Mandy, wait right there.


570
00:38:06.072 --> 00:38:06.772
It'll just be a minute.

571
00:38:07.006 --> 00:38:08.839
Ma'am, would you mind
closing the door?


572
00:38:08.972 --> 00:38:10.106
Okay. Sit.

573
00:38:13.339 --> 00:38:14.905
Hour's up.

574
00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:27.106
Fuck you.

575
00:38:37.572 --> 00:38:39.705
Mikey. Shit.

576
00:38:48.473 --> 00:38:51.772
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

577
00:38:52.373 --> 00:38:54.805
No one else in the unit
at the time that you know of?


578
00:38:55.072 --> 00:38:55.939
- No.
- No, sir.


579
00:38:56.272 --> 00:39:00.705
Nothing strange to report
when you saw Mr. Collins last?


580
00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.239
- Nope.
- No, sir.


581
00:39:02.872 --> 00:39:05.306
Although he was always
a bit surly.


582
00:39:05.705 --> 00:39:07.139
We'll notify the family.

583
00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:10.805
His poor family.

584
00:39:11.572 --> 00:39:12.905
They were never around.

585
00:39:13.638 --> 00:39:14.939
Well, it doesn't make it right.

586
00:39:15.239 --> 00:39:16.772
No, ma'am, it does not.

587
00:39:19.638 --> 00:39:20.572
Have a good night, officer.

588
00:39:20.739 --> 00:39:22.473
Uh, No, I'm staying
here till morning,


589
00:39:22.638 --> 00:39:24.373
just to make sure
you ladies are safe.


590
00:39:24.839 --> 00:39:26.538
Just gotta take care
of you ladies.


591
00:39:26.805 --> 00:39:28.772
I wanna keep an eye on things.

592
00:39:29.006 --> 00:39:31.805
Make sure that
no bad guys get in.


593
00:39:32.572 --> 00:39:34.172
Yeah, we got another officer
coming by to ask


594
00:39:34.306 --> 00:39:37.239
y'all some questions later.
He's like a detective, you know?


595
00:39:37.373 --> 00:39:39.239
I'm just sorta night shift.

596
00:39:39.972 --> 00:39:42.406
You know, I... I think y'all
got nothing to worry about.


597
00:39:42.605 --> 00:39:43.705
It was just
an out-of-the-ordinary


598
00:39:43.872 --> 00:39:46.939
- type situation.
- Well, you can say that again.


599
00:39:47.538 --> 00:39:48.839
It was just
an out-of-the-ordinary


600
00:39:48.972 --> 00:39:49.905
type situation.

601
00:39:51.739 --> 00:39:54.039
Oh.

602
00:39:54.538 --> 00:39:55.705
I get it.

603
00:39:59.306 --> 00:40:02.373
But I'll be here, all night.

604
00:40:02.805 --> 00:40:04.106
You two will be safe.

605
00:40:06.473 --> 00:40:08.538
- Are we done here?
- Yes, ma'am.


606
00:40:08.772 --> 00:40:09.872
That's all my questions.

607
00:40:10.572 --> 00:40:12.072
I got a lot of patients
to get to.


608
00:40:16.605 --> 00:40:19.239
Karen, Karen, Karen, Karen.

609
00:40:19.439 --> 00:40:21.272
Are you sure you don't have
a room for me?


610
00:40:21.406 --> 00:40:23.739
- Mr. Kent.
- Hmm?


611
00:40:23.939 --> 00:40:26.039
We have to get to
the priority problems first.


612
00:40:26.139 --> 00:40:27.672
I mean, look at you.
You're walking around,


613
00:40:27.805 --> 00:40:29.473
you're standing up. I...
I don't know even know


614
00:40:29.605 --> 00:40:31.172
- what's wrong with you.
- I'm dizzy.


615
00:40:31.339 --> 00:40:34.172
You don't need a room.

616
00:40:36.239 --> 00:40:37.972
- Hey.
- Hey.


617
00:40:42.605 --> 00:40:45.839
- You get interviewed?
- By that cute cop?


618
00:40:46.638 --> 00:40:48.872
- Yeah.
- He funny, ain't he?


619
00:40:49.006 --> 00:40:51.772
I like 'em funny, and rich.

620
00:40:52.339 --> 00:40:53.572
But he ain't rich.

621
00:40:56.006 --> 00:40:58.972
Mr. Kent.
Go sit down and wait your turn.


622
00:40:59.139 --> 00:41:00.239
You are nosy as hell.

623
00:41:01.473 --> 00:41:03.239
It's too stuffy in here, so.

624
00:41:04.939 --> 00:41:08.373
Someone expired in the ICU.
The coroner just left.


625
00:41:08.672 --> 00:41:11.272
And the body is in the morgue
waiting to be transferred.


626
00:41:11.739 --> 00:41:13.605
But I thought we agreed.

627
00:41:15.006 --> 00:41:17.805
Extenuating circumstances.
I'll explain later.


628
00:41:17.939 --> 00:41:19.672
Well, damn, bitch,
you could've warned me.


629
00:41:20.339 --> 00:41:22.406
You know, I got a bad heart,
I can't take this shit.


630
00:41:22.572 --> 00:41:23.772
Trust me.

631
00:41:24.006 --> 00:41:26.072
Trust you about as far
as I can throw you.


632
00:41:31.272 --> 00:41:32.206
Mr. Kent.

633
00:41:34.272 --> 00:41:35.572
Mr. Kent?

634
00:41:36.339 --> 00:41:37.638
We have a room for you.

635
00:41:40.505 --> 00:41:41.672
Where the hell did he go?

636
00:42:31.206 --> 00:42:32.172
Shit.

637
00:42:49.106 --> 00:42:50.072
Shit.

638
00:43:02.306 --> 00:43:03.538
Shit.

639
00:43:13.905 --> 00:43:18.106
Hey. Isn't it a little late
for you to be out here skating?


640
00:43:48.373 --> 00:43:49.638
Amen.

641

Freeze, motherfucker!

654
00:45:33.705 --> 00:45:37.705
Oh. Sorry.
Heard a noise.


655
00:45:38.538 --> 00:45:41.638
- Uh. It was me.
- Yeah.


656
00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:45.672
What happened?

657
00:45:48.672 --> 00:45:51.172
Man, y'all sure do get dirty,
huh?


658
00:45:54.272 --> 00:45:56.672
I could not do that.

659
00:45:56.972 --> 00:45:58.538
You want some help
with this guy?


660
00:45:59.272 --> 00:46:00.206
Uh...

661
00:46:01.006 --> 00:46:01.705
Sure.

662
00:46:02.139 --> 00:46:04.339
Sorry, I'm trying
to be a gentleman and all.


663
00:46:06.239 --> 00:46:07.939
One, two.

664
00:46:12.905 --> 00:46:15.139
You guys probably get a lot
of back issues, huh?


665
00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.039
Some people do.

666
00:46:18.172 --> 00:46:19.538
You look like you work in a...

667
00:46:20.373 --> 00:46:21.939
butcher shop.

668
00:46:24.206 --> 00:46:25.339
Hey, you want a soda?

669
00:46:25.905 --> 00:46:27.805
I just got an extra one
from the machine.


670
00:46:30.373 --> 00:46:31.538
I'm good.

671
00:46:33.106 --> 00:46:35.439
No offense, uh,
this room is real creepy.


672
00:46:35.572 --> 00:46:38.905
- And smells, so.
- Uh. Yeah.


673
00:46:39.473 --> 00:46:41.638
Totally.

674
00:46:43.439 --> 00:46:44.572
Wow.

675
00:46:48.772 --> 00:46:50.538
Oh, sorry.

676
00:46:52.439 --> 00:46:53.739
Probably not allowed
to touch that, huh?


677
00:46:53.972 --> 00:46:58.505
- Yeah. Better not.
- I mean, oh, okay.


678
00:46:58.638 --> 00:47:00.239
Just trying to be,
make a joke, you know?


679
00:47:00.373 --> 00:47:02.572
It's pretty disgusting.

680
00:47:03.006 --> 00:47:04.705
Not that I'm not used
to seeing...


681
00:47:05.505 --> 00:47:07.006
disgusting things. I mean, I...

682
00:47:07.772 --> 00:47:09.572
I really am.
You'd be surprised what happens.


683
00:47:09.705 --> 00:47:12.106
This one guy, he, um,
yeah, I mean, he, uh...


684
00:47:14.072 --> 00:47:15.939
Guess I don't really have
any stories.


685
00:47:16.072 --> 00:47:18.872
You know, just stuff happens,
you know? Yeah.


686
00:47:19.339 --> 00:47:20.505
It's kinda like, you
know, like <i>Cops,</i>


687
00:47:20.638 --> 00:47:23.239
- if you've ever seen that show.
- You know...


688
00:47:25.572 --> 00:47:28.705
- I think I will take that soda.
- All right.


689
00:47:31.538 --> 00:47:35.905
I'm so glad you're here,
to take care of us...


690
00:47:36.572 --> 00:47:38.106
to make sure we're safe.

691
00:47:40.872 --> 00:47:42.505
Just doing my job.

692
00:47:46.272 --> 00:47:47.705
I'll let you get back to yours.

693
00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:50.705
Mm-hmm. Bye.

694
00:48:24.106 --> 00:48:25.106
Shit.

695
00:48:28.605 --> 00:48:30.705
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Dorothy?


696
00:48:30.939 --> 00:48:32.972
Mandy?
I gotta go get that cute cop


697
00:48:33.106 --> 00:48:36.572
'cause I swear to God, there's
a dead body over there!


698
00:48:36.839 --> 00:48:39.839
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
There's another one.


699
00:48:40.006 --> 00:48:42.705
- A dead body, can you hear me?
- Where?


700
00:48:43.239 --> 00:48:44.538
- Huh?
- Where?


701
00:48:44.772 --> 00:48:46.839
Over by the storage shed!

702
00:48:46.905 --> 00:48:48.605
I don't know what I was...
I just went out there,


703
00:48:48.705 --> 00:48:50.672
just looking for somewhere
outta the rain to smoke.


704
00:48:50.805 --> 00:48:52.572
Oh, God, I shouldn't even
be smoking!


705
00:48:52.805 --> 00:48:54.538
And then...
and then there was a dead body!


706
00:48:54.805 --> 00:48:57.072
Do you know what that means?
Mandy!


707
00:48:57.206 --> 00:48:59.106
There is a murderer
loose in the hospital.


708
00:48:59.339 --> 00:49:02.239
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.


709
00:49:02.505 --> 00:49:06.772
- We're gonna die. Oh, God.
- Oh, God.


710
00:49:20.473 --> 00:49:22.772
- So, are you a doctor?
- No, I'm a nurse.


711
00:49:23.072 --> 00:49:25.339
Now go sit down.
I'll be with you in a minute.


712
00:49:29.538 --> 00:49:32.272
- We have a problem.
- Yeah, no kidding.


713
00:49:33.039 --> 00:49:34.872
Y'all found
someone to help me yet?


714
00:49:35.772 --> 00:49:36.739
Nope.

715
00:49:37.638 --> 00:49:39.006
Just let me know
when you do.


716
00:49:42.406 --> 00:49:43.672
Y'all... y'all stay safe.

717
00:49:44.239 --> 00:49:46.106
- Okay.
- What the hell?


718
00:49:47.239 --> 00:49:49.139
I guess we have multiple
problems.


719
00:49:49.939 --> 00:49:50.939
I need your help.

720
00:49:52.505 --> 00:49:53.939
Mandy, what did you get into?

721
00:49:54.072 --> 00:49:56.505
I'm just gonna apologize
in advance.


722
00:50:00.705 --> 00:50:02.505
<i>Wait, so this bitch
might be wearing scrubs?</i>


723
00:50:02.772 --> 00:50:05.172
She might be snorting up all
the Valium in the building,


724
00:50:05.306 --> 00:50:07.206
for all I know.
She's fucking nuts.


725
00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:09.473
I don't like it when
people call women nuts.


726
00:50:09.605 --> 00:50:11.373
It's just an excuse
to belittle their problems.


727
00:50:11.538 --> 00:50:13.373
And mental health
is nothing to belittle.


728
00:50:13.839 --> 00:50:16.206
This bitch is actually nuts.

729
00:50:16.473 --> 00:50:18.172
Say what you want,
doesn't mean I like it.


730
00:50:18.572 --> 00:50:20.306
- Excuse me, ladies?
- Not now, all right?


731
00:50:20.439 --> 00:50:21.339
Fine.

732
00:50:21.473 --> 00:50:22.672
<i>So, what's your plan here?</i>

733
00:50:23.039 --> 00:50:25.439
<i>Find this crazy bitch
and get her the fuck outta here</i>


734
00:50:25.572 --> 00:50:27.272
<i>before she tells on both of us.</i>

735
00:50:27.538 --> 00:50:28.605
<i>You're sure this was her?</i>

736
00:50:28.839 --> 00:50:29.739
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

737
00:50:30.272 --> 00:50:32.106
<i>Why would you bring
this cousin of yours into this</i>


738
00:50:32.239 --> 00:50:34.872
<i>if you knew she would kill
people and rat us both out?</i>


739
00:50:35.072 --> 00:50:37.672
I sometimes have
too much faith in humanity.


740
00:50:40.172 --> 00:50:41.505
That is what I like about you.

741
00:50:46.272 --> 00:50:48.672
But just so you know, if either
of you get me in trouble,


742
00:50:48.805 --> 00:50:51.206
I will ask God
to strike you both down,


743
00:50:51.339 --> 00:50:52.638
'cause he listens to me.

744
00:50:58.772 --> 00:50:59.705
Shit.

745
00:51:08.905 --> 00:51:11.272
Come on.

746
00:51:13.805 --> 00:51:15.473
- Ah, shit.
- We're going on a walk.


747
00:51:15.605 --> 00:51:16.572
All right.

748
00:51:16.939 --> 00:51:18.538
Hey, Dr. Wilder.

749
00:51:29.039 --> 00:51:30.106
Y'all look mad.

750
00:51:31.805 --> 00:51:33.272
Damn, bitch, where's your shoes?

751
00:51:33.473 --> 00:51:34.939
That guy pooped on them
when he died.


752
00:51:35.039 --> 00:51:36.605
Oh, Lord, you're right,
she is a murderer.


753
00:51:36.739 --> 00:51:38.172
Y'all are murderers first.

754
00:51:39.739 --> 00:51:43.239
- Look, I... I can explain.
- Mm-hmm.


755
00:51:44.039 --> 00:51:44.739
Yeah.

756
00:51:45.039 --> 00:51:47.172
- Are those your panties?
- Yeah.


757
00:51:47.439 --> 00:51:49.072
It's all I had to put
the kidney in.


758
00:51:49.505 --> 00:51:50.638
And I didn't hear from you

759
00:51:50.839 --> 00:51:52.272
and...
and it had been over an hour...


760
00:51:52.406 --> 00:51:54.439
I was caught up
in the mess you created.


761
00:51:54.572 --> 00:51:55.739
Well, I was all alone...

762
00:51:56.373 --> 00:51:58.905
and then Mikey came and there
was a cop waiting around...


763
00:51:59.306 --> 00:52:01.905
- Did they see you?
- No, never, I was just hiding.


764
00:52:02.206 --> 00:52:03.839
And then that kid came,
so I went over there


765
00:52:03.972 --> 00:52:05.705
- and I just... I...
- ...got it.


766
00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:07.605
Stop. You need to get
the fuck outta here.


767
00:52:07.739 --> 00:52:09.638
Those cops are gonna be
looking for you


768
00:52:09.772 --> 00:52:11.239
or anybody that did this shit.

769
00:52:11.406 --> 00:52:14.072
And there's some creep outside
waiting to rip your tits off.


770
00:52:14.206 --> 00:52:16.739
Well, it's fine now
'cause I have a kidney.


771
00:52:17.172 --> 00:52:19.605
Now I can see Mikey.
He won't rip my tits off.


772
00:52:19.739 --> 00:52:22.039
- That ain't no kidney.
- What isn't?


773
00:52:22.605 --> 00:52:25.373
That is not a kidney.
That's a bladder.


774
00:52:25.605 --> 00:52:27.339
- Oh, Lord Jesus.
- But how do you know that?


775
00:52:27.538 --> 00:52:29.505
I don't know if my heart
can take this right now.


776
00:52:29.939 --> 00:52:31.439
I saw where you opened
that kid up.


777
00:52:31.572 --> 00:52:32.705
You didn't even go in the back.

778
00:52:32.939 --> 00:52:35.172
No, my... my...
my kidneys are right here.


779
00:52:35.339 --> 00:52:37.373
Those are your ovaries.

780
00:52:37.939 --> 00:52:40.605
That is a bladder.
Damn, you're nuts!


781
00:52:40.905 --> 00:52:43.139
Maybe you should think
about this shit


782
00:52:43.272 --> 00:52:44.439
before you go murdering someone.

783
00:52:44.572 --> 00:52:45.473
I hate you.

784
00:52:47.206 --> 00:52:49.039
Shit. They're coming for me.

785
00:52:49.672 --> 00:52:51.406
It's just the storm.

786
00:52:51.972 --> 00:52:53.239
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

787
00:52:53.406 --> 00:52:56.006
<i>I have to inform you that we
are in a lock down situation.</i>


788
00:52:57.306 --> 00:52:59.039
Oh, that is not necessary.

789
00:52:59.839 --> 00:53:02.006
<i>Do not exit
or enter the building.</i>


790
00:53:03.705 --> 00:53:05.239
Shit, I gotta get
the fuck outta here.


791
00:53:05.638 --> 00:53:07.006
I just, I'm gonna go run.

792
00:53:09.306 --> 00:53:11.306
- I'm just gonna run outta here.
- Stop.


793
00:53:12.638 --> 00:53:14.505
I got you a kidney,
like I said I would.


794
00:53:14.772 --> 00:53:15.805
It's down by the soda machine.

795
00:53:16.072 --> 00:53:19.473
Go down there, get it,
and get the fuck outta here.


796
00:53:19.672 --> 00:53:21.839
But there's cops outside.

797
00:53:22.638 --> 00:53:23.638
Karen will walk you out.

798
00:53:23.772 --> 00:53:25.006
- Mm-mm.
- And I'll distract the cops.


799
00:53:25.072 --> 00:53:27.006
I... I'm not going anywhere
with that murderer, no.


800
00:53:27.072 --> 00:53:27.772
I'm pulling rank.

801
00:53:28.106 --> 00:53:29.705
All right, all right,
all right, fine.


802
00:53:31.139 --> 00:53:32.106
I will walk you out.

803
00:53:32.972 --> 00:53:34.872
Will you kindly...

804
00:53:35.473 --> 00:53:37.373
distract the cops?

805
00:53:37.572 --> 00:53:39.339
Just get them
to the waiting room


806
00:53:39.473 --> 00:53:40.672
and we'll sneak out the back.

807
00:53:43.373 --> 00:53:46.672
Fuck, can't believe I'm taking
pity on your redneck ass.


808
00:53:46.939 --> 00:53:49.638
Okay, give me ten minutes...

809
00:53:50.705 --> 00:53:52.306
and if I catch...

810
00:53:52.839 --> 00:53:56.239
your skinny ass,
impersonating a nurse again,


811
00:53:56.739 --> 00:53:58.638
I will rip your bladder out.

812
00:53:58.905 --> 00:54:01.672
- Okay. Thank you.
- She said, "Thank you."


813
00:54:02.905 --> 00:54:05.039
- Ten minutes.
- Yeah, ten minutes.


814
00:54:05.538 --> 00:54:08.039
We're just gonna wait here
for a minute.


815
00:54:10.705 --> 00:54:13.939
<i>Hospital,
code red. Shelter in place.</i>


816
00:54:17.473 --> 00:54:18.672
Um...

817
00:54:20.605 --> 00:54:21.638
Let's go to the nurse's station.

818
00:54:21.739 --> 00:54:22.972
We're gonna go
to the nurse's station.


819
00:54:23.106 --> 00:54:25.139
Why do we have to go
to the nurse's station?


820
00:54:25.839 --> 00:54:27.638
- We just have to.
- Why?


821
00:54:28.206 --> 00:54:29.272
People are there.

822
00:54:39.039 --> 00:54:39.972
Throw that away.

823
00:54:42.538 --> 00:54:43.739
<i>Hospital, code red.</i>

824
00:54:43.872 --> 00:54:45.972
- You look sweaty.
- Shut up, let's go.


825
00:54:46.172 --> 00:54:47.139
Wait.

826
00:54:48.839 --> 00:54:51.239
- I just wanna go home.
- It's late


827
00:54:51.373 --> 00:54:52.672
and I can't get a hold
of anyone.


828
00:54:52.905 --> 00:54:54.239
Well, then I'm going on a break.

829
00:54:54.406 --> 00:54:57.605
We don't have time for you
to take a break, Dorothy.


830
00:54:59.339 --> 00:55:02.373
Mandy, I need you out front.
Someone needs to be out there


831
00:55:02.505 --> 00:55:03.638
to keep the public
from getting in.


832
00:55:03.772 --> 00:55:06.739
It's like no one understands
what lockdown means.


833
00:55:07.872 --> 00:55:10.039
I was just, um...
I was just going out


834
00:55:10.172 --> 00:55:12.106
- for a smoke break.
- Is that a joke?


835
00:55:12.439 --> 00:55:15.039
And you, little missy, need to
get back to your own floor.


836
00:55:15.339 --> 00:55:16.373
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.


837
00:55:16.672 --> 00:55:18.872
- I'll take her.
- Why would you need to do that?


838
00:55:19.473 --> 00:55:20.638
Dammit, Mandy.

839
00:55:20.905 --> 00:55:24.139
There is too much going on.
Just go before I write you up.


840
00:55:25.505 --> 00:55:27.772
It's just been a long night.

841
00:55:28.272 --> 00:55:33.139
For everyone. It's been
a long night for everyone.


842
00:55:33.772 --> 00:55:34.505
Go.

843
00:55:35.006 --> 00:55:36.505
<i>Hospital,
code red. Shelter in place.</i>


844
00:55:36.572 --> 00:55:37.805
Double go.

845
00:56:31.739 --> 00:56:33.805
- Hey, you can't be back here.
- Help.


846
00:56:34.373 --> 00:56:36.006
Help, really scary guy...

847
00:56:36.139 --> 00:56:37.272
...in the waiting room.

848
00:56:37.638 --> 00:56:39.672
Probably the murderer
that you're looking for.


849
00:56:40.272 --> 00:56:41.672
Huge, very huge, hulking.

850
00:56:42.072 --> 00:56:44.538
- Okay, you stay here...
- Nope, no, no, no.


851
00:56:44.672 --> 00:56:46.373
Definitely both of you
'cause...


852
00:56:46.505 --> 00:56:49.272
...he's huge.
So can you just, like...


853
00:56:50.473 --> 00:56:52.172
Yes, waiting room.

854
00:57:01.505 --> 00:57:02.605
Oh, it's you.

855
00:57:03.139 --> 00:57:04.939
Finally, I... I was calling
about my mother.


856
00:57:18.805 --> 00:57:20.872
What can I do for you?

857
00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:25.272
Oh, hi, we're on lock down.
You can't be on this floor.


858
00:57:26.406 --> 00:57:28.805
Uh. Excuse me, who are you?

859
00:57:30.772 --> 00:57:31.739
Hello?

860
00:57:32.406 --> 00:57:33.605
Excuse me!

861
00:57:34.406 --> 00:57:36.039
We are on lockdown!

862
00:57:38.072 --> 00:57:40.072
Did...
did you speak to my daughter?


863
00:57:40.272 --> 00:57:41.473
- What?
- You said you were gonna


864
00:57:41.605 --> 00:57:43.605
- get her back up here.
- That... that was someone else.


865
00:57:43.772 --> 00:57:46.006
My daughter needs
to know that I'm sick.


866
00:57:46.638 --> 00:57:49.306
That's the reason
I'm in this fancy hotel.


867
00:57:49.439 --> 00:57:51.373
Uh. Wha... wha...
what kind of sick?


868
00:57:51.572 --> 00:57:53.939
I feel nauseated.
Can I get a warm towel?


869
00:57:54.072 --> 00:57:57.106
- I'll get a nurse.
- You look like a nurse.


870
00:57:58.473 --> 00:57:59.406
Who are you?

871
00:57:59.605 --> 00:58:01.172
You are not supposed to be
in here.


872
00:58:02.672 --> 00:58:04.572
- I'm a new nurse.
- In what unit?


873
00:58:04.805 --> 00:58:08.206
- Uh. Today's my first day.
- Where do you work?


874
00:58:09.439 --> 00:58:11.972
Third floor.
I just came down here


875
00:58:12.106 --> 00:58:15.039
'cause, uh, I know this...
this woman.


876
00:58:15.206 --> 00:58:16.172
Does she know you?

877
00:58:16.805 --> 00:58:20.638
She's sick. Obviously.
Doesn't remember a damn thing,


878
00:58:20.772 --> 00:58:24.139
but we are such good...

879
00:58:24.805 --> 00:58:28.538
- friends from church.
- I do go to church.


880
00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:32.538
Well, what... is her name?

881
00:58:33.638 --> 00:58:37.039
Uh. Patrick. Uh. Mrs. Patrick.

882
00:58:38.172 --> 00:58:39.406
That's my married name.

883
00:58:39.638 --> 00:58:41.939
Okay. Fine. Sorry, Mrs. Patrick.

884
00:58:42.605 --> 00:58:45.072
I didn't realize that you
were such good friends.


885
00:58:45.306 --> 00:58:46.406
You know we're on a lockdown?

886
00:58:46.805 --> 00:58:48.538
You're not supposed
to leave your floor.


887
00:58:49.172 --> 00:58:49.905
Really?

888
00:58:50.039 --> 00:58:51.439
There was a dead body.

889
00:58:51.605 --> 00:58:54.638
I found it. I was smoking,
please don't tell.


890
00:58:55.439 --> 00:58:56.473
You need to go back upstairs.

891
00:58:56.605 --> 00:58:57.805
Did they not announce
it up on third?


892
00:58:57.939 --> 00:58:59.739
- No, no, no.
- Yes, they did.


893
00:58:59.939 --> 00:59:02.739
You gotta get back up there.
Where are your shoes?


894
00:59:03.939 --> 00:59:04.905
Uh...

895
00:59:11.272 --> 00:59:14.239
- Help me!
- No, no.


896
00:59:14.373 --> 00:59:16.638
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no.


897
00:59:18.805 --> 00:59:20.772
I threw up.

898
00:59:21.406 --> 00:59:23.605
Can you get that
warm towel for me?


899
00:59:29.006 --> 00:59:31.672
You better not have
given me a disease.


900
00:59:34.739 --> 00:59:37.139
Dammit. Goddammit.

901
00:59:39.339 --> 00:59:40.505
You're strong.

902
00:59:43.339 --> 00:59:45.772
Dammit! Dammit!

903
00:59:46.672 --> 00:59:48.805
Ma'am, are you okay?

904
00:59:51.373 --> 00:59:53.605
Help me! Help us!

905
00:59:56.439 --> 00:59:58.572
Hey, girl. Are you new?

906
01:00:16.939 --> 01:00:18.373
Where do you think
you're going?


907
01:00:19.106 --> 01:00:20.805
Just heading back
to the third floor.


908
01:00:20.939 --> 01:00:22.972
No, ma'am. No elevators
'cause of lock down.


909
01:00:23.106 --> 01:00:25.638
- You gotta take the stairs.
- Mm. Okay.


910
01:00:26.772 --> 01:00:28.538
And make sure
that someone from your floor


911
01:00:28.672 --> 01:00:29.772
comes down to assist the cops.

912
01:00:30.006 --> 01:00:31.672
- Sure.
- We can't do everything.


913
01:00:32.039 --> 01:00:33.072
Yep, thanks.

914
01:00:37.572 --> 01:00:38.638
Could you tell if he was armed?

915
01:00:38.872 --> 01:00:40.872
I don't know, don't murderers
always have weapons?


916
01:00:46.373 --> 01:00:48.839
Well, I... I mean, he was...
he was here just a minute ago.


917
01:00:48.972 --> 01:00:50.638
Uh. And like I said,
he was really, really...


918
01:00:50.839 --> 01:00:51.872
He was really horrible-looking.

919
01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:53.939
- Maybe he left.
- Or... or maybe he went back


920
01:00:54.072 --> 01:00:55.538
into the hospital
and murder more people.


921
01:00:55.672 --> 01:00:58.872
Murder people? What is going on?
Are we in danger here?


922
01:00:59.006 --> 01:01:01.439
No, ma'am, everything is fine.
Just remain calm.


923
01:01:01.572 --> 01:01:03.172
Well, I need to know
what's going on.


924
01:01:03.538 --> 01:01:06.072
- I'm going. Good luck.
- Okay, good luck to you.


925
01:01:17.072 --> 01:01:18.106
Well, hello.

926
01:01:19.072 --> 01:01:19.972
Wow.

927
01:01:20.505 --> 01:01:22.406
You look fucking gross, Regina.

928
01:01:23.039 --> 01:01:25.139
You know, I've been...

929
01:01:25.272 --> 01:01:26.939
I've been looking for you,
skanky.


930
01:01:27.872 --> 01:01:28.805
Good.

931
01:01:29.538 --> 01:01:31.439
I was looking for you too.

932
01:01:31.572 --> 01:01:33.572
Hmm, you know,
I'm supposed to drag you back


933
01:01:33.705 --> 01:01:34.972
to Nicholas by your hair.

934
01:01:35.072 --> 01:01:37.239
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?


935
01:01:37.373 --> 01:01:40.139
Now, I've got legs.
I can just walk.


936
01:01:40.538 --> 01:01:43.172
Don't you want a damn kidney?

937
01:01:43.439 --> 01:01:45.106
Oh, it's a little late for that.

938
01:01:45.972 --> 01:01:46.872
Look...

939
01:01:47.473 --> 01:01:50.406
it's not my fault.
My stupid cousin...


940
01:01:51.072 --> 01:01:54.339
she lost it, but...
but she got me another one.


941
01:01:54.473 --> 01:01:56.272
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.


942
01:01:59.239 --> 01:01:59.939
No.

943
01:02:00.306 --> 01:02:03.739
No, do not try all that
sexy shit with me, Regina.


944
01:02:03.905 --> 01:02:05.839
You are covered in blood
and puke.


945
01:02:08.473 --> 01:02:09.638
Not impressed.

946
01:02:10.605 --> 01:02:12.739
- Told you.
- That's a great cooler.


947
01:02:13.139 --> 01:02:16.072
- Can you open it up?
- A lot of work went into this.


948
01:02:16.739 --> 01:02:21.839
You wouldn't believe the trouble
we went to to get you this.


949
01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.239
Now, what the fuck?

950
01:02:26.739 --> 01:02:29.139
What the fuck indeed, Regina.

951
01:02:29.239 --> 01:02:30.339
Come here.

952
01:02:30.439 --> 01:02:31.705
- Oh, wait.
- Come here!


953
01:02:43.272 --> 01:02:44.206
Thanks for these.

954
01:02:45.672 --> 01:02:47.805
Maybe the nicest thing
you ever did for me.


955
01:02:48.373 --> 01:02:50.206
Mandy?

956
01:02:51.739 --> 01:02:53.805
This is the suspicious woman,
ma'am?


957
01:02:54.339 --> 01:02:55.672
I don't think so.

958
01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:57.972
It is Mandy, isn't it?

959
01:02:58.638 --> 01:03:00.638
- Yeah.
- This isn't her.


960
01:03:01.772 --> 01:03:02.705
Mandy?

961
01:03:03.505 --> 01:03:04.972
What are you doing
with my patient?


962
01:03:05.172 --> 01:03:06.473
- Excuse me.
- Uh...


963
01:03:06.672 --> 01:03:09.006
Goddammit! Again?

964
01:03:09.605 --> 01:03:11.139
All right, now go over
with me again


965
01:03:11.272 --> 01:03:13.339
where you were around 2:00 a.m.

966
01:03:13.739 --> 01:03:15.272
- You saw me.
- In the morgue.


967
01:03:15.406 --> 01:03:16.572
What were you doing
in the morgue?


968
01:03:16.705 --> 01:03:17.972
You have no business
being in there.


969
01:03:18.139 --> 01:03:20.972
I was checking
a deceased patient's records.


970
01:03:21.206 --> 01:03:24.373
Officer Myers,
this woman is on probation.


971
01:03:24.605 --> 01:03:26.439
That is an internal probation

972
01:03:26.572 --> 01:03:27.739
and he doesn't need to know
about it.


973
01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:31.006
It's relevant
and now it's extended.


974
01:03:31.705 --> 01:03:33.339
If you were checking records

975
01:03:33.473 --> 01:03:35.772
in the morgue,
why were you covered in blood?


976
01:03:36.739 --> 01:03:38.373
Oh, that's what happens
in a morgue.


977
01:03:38.572 --> 01:03:40.939
- But you changed?
- That's what we do.


978
01:03:41.106 --> 01:03:43.039
Don't wanna walk around
covered in blood.


979
01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:46.172
That's right.

980
01:03:47.839 --> 01:03:50.039
Come on, Janet, you know me.

981
01:03:51.072 --> 01:03:52.805
What were you doing
with those vials?


982
01:03:53.039 --> 01:03:55.672
Checking them,
seeing what you had him on.


983
01:03:55.872 --> 01:03:57.905
- And why would you do that?
- Hey.


984
01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:00.739
That's enough. I think
we're gonna have to go down


985
01:04:00.872 --> 01:04:02.439
to the station
and talk this thing out.


986
01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:04.339
- Oh!
- Unless, you can explain to me


987
01:04:04.505 --> 01:04:05.638
what's going on.

988
01:04:11.406 --> 01:04:12.605
That's my brother.

989
01:04:14.572 --> 01:04:17.172
That's my brother
in that room in a coma.


990
01:04:17.772 --> 01:04:20.972
The drug addict.
I was worried about him.


991
01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:25.272
She's lying.

992
01:04:25.638 --> 01:04:28.039
She has never mentioned
a brother, not once.


993
01:04:28.339 --> 01:04:30.072
I'm not lying, Jesus. I'm...

994
01:04:31.339 --> 01:04:33.939
His name is Andrew McCandry.

995
01:04:34.473 --> 01:04:35.638
My half-brother.

996
01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:39.339
He has OD'd three times
in the past two years.


997
01:04:39.538 --> 01:04:40.872
And this time...

998
01:04:42.406 --> 01:04:43.739
may be his last,
according to what


999
01:04:43.872 --> 01:04:46.373
I just read on that chart.
Did you check his files?


1000
01:04:46.505 --> 01:04:48.106
- Yeah.
- That's right, isn't it?


1001
01:04:48.572 --> 01:04:50.239
Yeah. That's right.

1002
01:04:50.572 --> 01:04:52.139
I'm sorry,
I really do trust you.


1003
01:04:52.406 --> 01:04:56.039
I just wanted to make sure
he was getting the best care.


1004
01:04:56.439 --> 01:04:58.106
I care about him and...

1005
01:05:03.505 --> 01:05:05.172
So much I care about him.

1006
01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:10.905
Fuck, I believe you.

1007
01:05:15.072 --> 01:05:16.638
Thank you, Officer Myers.

1008
01:05:17.672 --> 01:05:19.505
But you still gotta come down
to the station with me.


1009
01:05:19.638 --> 01:05:21.172
I got a lot of questions
for you, Mandy.


1010
01:05:21.339 --> 01:05:23.538
I just answered
all your questions.


1011
01:05:23.705 --> 01:05:24.972
Stephen.

1012
01:05:25.572 --> 01:05:28.672
Ma'am. Uh. We got an issue.
A new one.


1013
01:05:30.139 --> 01:05:32.473
Oh. Mandy, come with me.

1014
01:05:33.339 --> 01:05:37.172
I can still get you a kidney.
I know how.


1015
01:05:38.439 --> 01:05:41.239
You are so fucking stupid,
do you know that?


1016
01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:43.972
Every teacher I ever had
told me that already,


1017
01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.072
so shut up!

1018
01:05:46.406 --> 01:05:47.672
These nurses...

1019
01:05:48.739 --> 01:05:50.872
they just go for someone
on the verge of death


1020
01:05:51.006 --> 01:05:52.373
so no one notices.

1021
01:05:52.939 --> 01:05:56.239
Me and you can take one
of these dying fuckers


1022
01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:58.306
and just drag him on outta here.

1023
01:05:58.805 --> 01:06:00.638
Use a whole damn body
if you want.


1024
01:06:00.805 --> 01:06:02.172
It'll be fresh as hell.

1025
01:06:02.772 --> 01:06:05.006
You'll probably make Nicholas
real happy.


1026
01:06:05.473 --> 01:06:07.106
Well, you don't just get
a kidney.


1027
01:06:07.306 --> 01:06:09.805
You get all the organs inside.

1028
01:06:10.905 --> 01:06:13.939
I know the exact dying asshole
you can use.


1029
01:06:21.772 --> 01:06:23.839
Just having a lover's quarrel.

1030
01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:25.972
I've been there.

1031
01:06:28.206 --> 01:06:29.206
It's raining, huh?

1032
01:06:29.672 --> 01:06:31.739
Yeah, it's really pissing out
there tonight.


1033
01:06:34.905 --> 01:06:38.872
- I know you. Don't I?
- Regina.


1034
01:06:40.139 --> 01:06:41.972
Didn't you say had someone
you needed to see inside?


1035
01:06:42.139 --> 01:06:45.239
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's leave the man alone.


1036
01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:50.006
Good seeing you again, blondie.

1037
01:06:58.439 --> 01:06:59.672
Call it in.

1038
01:07:00.805 --> 01:07:02.339
- Where's his pants?
- Charmaine,


1039
01:07:02.473 --> 01:07:04.172
we've got a 10-74
at the hospital.


1040
01:07:05.406 --> 01:07:06.672
Looks pretty dead to me.

1041
01:07:25.406 --> 01:07:27.106
Hey, hey, you're not permitted
to leave.


1042
01:07:28.172 --> 01:07:30.439
Hey, Mandy! Mandy, hey!

1043
01:07:30.972 --> 01:07:33.739
Go downstairs, wait for backup.
Hey, hey.


1044
01:07:34.505 --> 01:07:35.805
What the hell's wrong with you?

1045
01:07:35.905 --> 01:07:36.638
<i>Mandy!</i>

1046
01:07:36.805 --> 01:07:38.638
- <i>Someone get in here!</i>
- Co... come on!


1047
01:07:47.805 --> 01:07:49.605
- Whoa.
- What the fuck?


1048
01:07:49.739 --> 01:07:51.339
Please, dear, don't curse.

1049
01:07:51.473 --> 01:07:53.339
She's alive, someone get
a stretcher.


1050
01:07:53.473 --> 01:07:55.072
A... all right, everybody
just calm down.


1051
01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:58.072
- I didn't do it.
- What the fuck is happening?


1052
01:07:58.239 --> 01:08:00.572
- What did you do, Mandy?
- I was with you.


1053
01:08:00.705 --> 01:08:02.072
Hey, hey, stay calm.

1054
01:08:02.672 --> 01:08:04.439
- I'll go get help.
- No, no, you stay here


1055
01:08:04.572 --> 01:08:05.638
and I... I... I'll call it in.

1056
01:08:05.772 --> 01:08:07.072
We need to get that
woman off the ground


1057
01:08:07.172 --> 01:08:10.072
and help her now.
She is bleeding, badly.


1058
01:08:10.339 --> 01:08:12.039
Shit! Fuck! Mandy!

1059
01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:15.306
You are not permitted
to go anywhere.


1060
01:08:16.172 --> 01:08:18.206
I took an oath to help people,
Officer Myers.


1061
01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:20.572
I'm not just gonna leave Dorothy
on the floor dying.


1062
01:08:20.705 --> 01:08:22.805
And I'm telling you
not to fucking move.


1063
01:08:23.638 --> 01:08:26.072
I'll come clean with you.

1064
01:08:26.772 --> 01:08:28.672
There may be someone
in the hospital


1065
01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:31.739
doing all of this
and I know who it is.


1066
01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:40.272
Shit.

1067
01:08:41.473 --> 01:08:42.939
I fucking hate cops.

1068
01:08:44.172 --> 01:08:45.605
But we already went over this.

1069
01:08:52.006 --> 01:08:52.972
Get the fuck off of him.

1070
01:08:53.306 --> 01:08:55.272
I couldn't find any bleach!

1071
01:08:57.505 --> 01:09:00.139
Oh, man!

1072
01:09:00.373 --> 01:09:01.306
Ooh!

1073
01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:04.538
What the fuck? What the fuck?
Fucking bitch!


1074
01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:06.672
Both of you get the fuck outta
here.


1075
01:09:06.872 --> 01:09:08.473
I gotta get some organs.

1076
01:09:08.672 --> 01:09:11.106
There is a kidney in the cooler.

1077
01:09:11.239 --> 01:09:12.272
It's gone!

1078
01:09:12.672 --> 01:09:14.206
- You are lying.
- That's the truth.


1079
01:09:14.972 --> 01:09:17.272
Are you telling me you lost
two kidneys in one night?


1080
01:09:17.406 --> 01:09:18.739
- She said you lost them.
- She did.


1081
01:09:18.805 --> 01:09:19.939
I'm the one who got them
for her.


1082
01:09:20.106 --> 01:09:21.805
- How could I lose 'em?
- This is too much talking.


1083
01:09:21.872 --> 01:09:23.006
We taking this guy with us
or what?


1084
01:09:23.139 --> 01:09:25.505
No, you are not. You are gonna
go back to Nicholas


1085
01:09:25.638 --> 01:09:27.572
and you are gonna tell him
this shit is off.


1086
01:09:27.772 --> 01:09:29.106
He can go to hell
and so can you.


1087
01:09:29.239 --> 01:09:31.705
Come on, what the fuck
did Andrew ever do for you


1088
01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:34.072
except give you an addiction,
huh?


1089
01:09:34.206 --> 01:09:36.805
What the fuck is happening?
Get off of her!


1090
01:09:41.306 --> 01:09:43.872
Fuck.

1091
01:09:46.572 --> 01:09:48.039
Freeze!

1092
01:09:48.172 --> 01:09:49.239
No!

1093
01:09:49.505 --> 01:09:50.872
You freeze.

1094
01:09:51.572 --> 01:09:54.473
Fuck! Fuck.

1095
01:09:55.672 --> 01:09:57.473
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1096
01:09:57.739 --> 01:10:00.473
- I don't wanna shoot you!
- You already fucking shot me!


1097
01:10:00.605 --> 01:10:02.272
I don't wanna shoot you again!

1098
01:10:02.572 --> 01:10:04.006
You fucking asshole.

1099
01:10:04.106 --> 01:10:04.805
I have hostages.

1100
01:10:05.172 --> 01:10:06.538
Just back away from the door
and let me through.


1101
01:10:06.705 --> 01:10:07.905
Don't hurt 'em.

1102
01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.572
Patch me up, now!

1103
01:10:11.839 --> 01:10:14.272
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on.


1104
01:10:14.439 --> 01:10:15.638
- I'm coming.
- Fuck.


1105
01:10:15.839 --> 01:10:17.006
Don't try anything weird.

1106
01:10:24.705 --> 01:10:26.439
The bullet is in there.
You need to get it out.


1107
01:10:26.505 --> 01:10:27.572
Yeah, I know that.

1108
01:10:27.739 --> 01:10:29.306
You think this is the first time
I've been shot?


1109
01:10:29.406 --> 01:10:30.872
I'm coming in!

1110
01:10:31.206 --> 01:10:32.872
I swear to God, I will shoot
both these bitches!


1111
01:10:33.039 --> 01:10:35.805
We're gonna go out the backdoor
and you're gonna let us!


1112
01:10:35.939 --> 01:10:36.872
No, you're not!

1113
01:10:37.072 --> 01:10:39.139
I will shoot them
if they try anything!


1114
01:10:39.872 --> 01:10:41.072
And we're taking this fucker
with us.


1115
01:10:41.206 --> 01:10:42.939
- Get him in the wheelchair.
- No fucking way.


1116
01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:46.039
Regina said we can have
all his organs, let's go!


1117
01:10:46.172 --> 01:10:48.939
You are not taking my brother.

1118
01:10:49.139 --> 01:10:52.139
Save him or save yourself.
It's your choice.


1119
01:10:52.272 --> 01:10:53.872
We are taking him regardless.

1120
01:10:54.206 --> 01:10:56.272
Mandy, what's going on in there?

1121
01:11:00.538 --> 01:11:05.839
Okay. I'll do it.
Get that gun out of my face.


1122
01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:09.239
Regina, get the wheelchair.

1123
01:11:14.306 --> 01:11:15.705
Let's go. Go, go, go, go.

1124
01:11:18.039 --> 01:11:19.905
Damn, get the thing out
of his face.


1125
01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:26.839
Come on, hang on. Dammit.

1126
01:11:28.505 --> 01:11:30.939
Goddammit.

1127
01:11:33.072 --> 01:11:33.839
All right.

1128
01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:35.839
Uh. We're gonna head downstairs
and when we get outside,


1129
01:11:35.972 --> 01:11:38.139
- I'm taking him with me.
- Stay where you are!


1130
01:11:38.272 --> 01:11:39.473
Jesus Christ, shut up!

1131
01:11:43.272 --> 01:11:44.939
- Shit!
- What's happening?


1132
01:11:45.172 --> 01:11:48.373
Don't these people need, like,
machines to breathe and shit?


1133
01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.373
I swear to God,
what did you do, lady?


1134
01:11:50.538 --> 01:11:51.439
It is just the lights.

1135
01:11:51.839 --> 01:11:53.839
Backup generator takes care
of all the vital stuff.


1136
01:11:54.106 --> 01:11:58.239
Now... ...we are going
to go down the hall,


1137
01:11:58.373 --> 01:11:59.572
carry him down the stairs,

1138
01:11:59.705 --> 01:12:01.006
and you can go out
the backdoor, okay?


1139
01:12:01.106 --> 01:12:02.572
All right, but I'm taking
Regina with me.


1140
01:12:02.705 --> 01:12:04.972
- Regina is staying here.
- No, she does not.


1141
01:12:05.172 --> 01:12:09.172
That is the deal.
You get Andrew, I get Regina.


1142
01:12:09.538 --> 01:12:11.473
You know,
I don't have time for this shit.


1143
01:12:11.605 --> 01:12:15.272
Fine, fuck it, whatever.
You push him. Go!


1144
01:12:18.939 --> 01:12:20.473
Wait, I wanna give him
a sedative.


1145
01:12:20.605 --> 01:12:21.572
Why?

1146
01:12:21.839 --> 01:12:23.439
So he doesn't wake up
in the middle of you


1147
01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:24.772
operating on him.

1148
01:12:29.239 --> 01:12:30.139
Fuck.

1149
01:12:31.772 --> 01:12:34.139
- Fuck!
- You got this?


1150
01:12:34.839 --> 01:12:36.605
Yeah. Yeah.

1151
01:12:38.538 --> 01:12:40.039
Nurse, hurry up!

1152
01:12:44.672 --> 01:12:46.272
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is going on?


1153
01:12:46.406 --> 01:12:48.039
- I'm nervous.
- Junkie.


1154
01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:57.306
Oh, my fucking eye!

1155
01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.206
- Go.
- Bitches!


1156
01:12:59.672 --> 01:13:01.373
Why take Andrew? Leave him.

1157
01:13:01.473 --> 01:13:03.106
I don't want him
taken away for organs.


1158
01:13:03.206 --> 01:13:04.373
Why the fuck are you so nice

1159
01:13:04.439 --> 01:13:05.739
to someone
who just treated you like shit?


1160
01:13:05.839 --> 01:13:07.538
- You treat me like shit.
- We gotta go.


1161
01:13:07.638 --> 01:13:09.039
- Hold on!
- Get up!


1162
01:13:32.072 --> 01:13:34.872
- He's got my knife.
- Crazy cunts.


1163
01:13:38.272 --> 01:13:39.339
I'm going out the front.

1164
01:13:39.473 --> 01:13:42.139
I can't do that,
they got cops outside.


1165
01:13:42.473 --> 01:13:44.039
Mandy?

1166
01:13:44.306 --> 01:13:45.206
Mandy?

1167
01:13:45.572 --> 01:13:47.072
Did you hear that noise,
what the fuck is going on?


1168
01:13:47.406 --> 01:13:48.339
Janet, run!

1169
01:13:51.872 --> 01:13:53.972
Goddammit.

1170
01:13:56.605 --> 01:13:57.839
Sorry, ma'am.

1171
01:13:59.505 --> 01:14:01.006
Go in that room
and lock the door.


1172
01:14:01.172 --> 01:14:02.072
Go!

1173
01:14:09.339 --> 01:14:10.505
Shit.

1174
01:14:10.638 --> 01:14:12.272
Someone turned out
my nightlight.


1175
01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:13.505
What is happening here?

1176
01:14:13.605 --> 01:14:14.772
Do you know why the lights
went out?


1177
01:14:14.872 --> 01:14:16.439
And is this blood on the floor?

1178
01:14:16.572 --> 01:14:18.139
Y'all just need to stay cool.

1179
01:14:19.139 --> 01:14:20.139
Shit.

1180
01:14:25.772 --> 01:14:28.172
You assholes took my eye!

1181
01:14:29.705 --> 01:14:32.505
Janet, Janet.
Come on, come on.


1182
01:14:34.172 --> 01:14:35.572
That's right, put your head up.

1183
01:14:40.072 --> 01:14:41.239
What's going on?

1184
01:14:43.072 --> 01:14:45.106
Okay, lift up
for one second, one second.


1185
01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:46.705
Okay.

1186
01:14:53.638 --> 01:14:56.905
No! That's my friend!
From church!


1187
01:14:58.505 --> 01:15:00.272
Dammit.

1188
01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:02.538
Get the fuck outta here!

1189
01:15:02.672 --> 01:15:04.106
He's in there. Run.

1190
01:15:04.705 --> 01:15:06.239
- Get the fuck over here!
- No!


1191
01:15:06.339 --> 01:15:07.406
You think
you can just run away


1192
01:15:07.505 --> 01:15:08.739
and I wouldn't catch you?

1193
01:15:08.839 --> 01:15:09.939
Well, now I'm taking
both of y'all,


1194
01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:11.905
you and the fucking
wheelchair boy.


1195
01:15:12.039 --> 01:15:14.006
There's gotta be something
useful inside each of you,


1196
01:15:14.172 --> 01:15:16.538
unless yours is blackened
from painkillers!


1197
01:15:16.672 --> 01:15:17.939
Mikey, don't hurt her.

1198
01:15:21.106 --> 01:15:24.605
Okay, y'all go!
Go, this ain't gonna last long.


1199
01:15:26.139 --> 01:15:27.139
Run!

1200
01:15:30.172 --> 01:15:31.572
Oh, shit.

1201
01:16:06.872 --> 01:16:09.106
Oh, come on.

1202
01:16:09.373 --> 01:16:11.039
What the fuck, ladies?

1203
01:16:12.473 --> 01:16:14.106
I know you're out here
somewhere.


1204
01:16:19.006 --> 01:16:21.039
Come on, bitches,
it's cold out here!


1205
01:16:21.172 --> 01:16:22.505
Where you at?

1206
01:16:23.839 --> 01:16:24.739
Woo.

1207
01:16:25.672 --> 01:16:26.939
You out in that rain?

1208
01:16:27.672 --> 01:16:29.538
Ooh, you better be running
in that rain!


1209
01:16:29.705 --> 01:16:32.905
You better be singing
in that rain! Enjoying it!


1210
01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:35.672
But I know you're not...

1211
01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:38.538
not with all them cops
out there...


1212
01:16:40.439 --> 01:16:41.672
'cause I may do some...

1213
01:16:43.239 --> 01:16:44.538
illegal shit...

1214
01:16:45.939 --> 01:16:48.939
but it ain't nothing
compared to you two lunatics.


1215
01:16:51.505 --> 01:16:53.106
But I got plans for y'all.

1216
01:16:58.972 --> 01:16:59.939
Mm.

1217
01:17:01.106 --> 01:17:02.039
Spurt.

1218
01:17:04.505 --> 01:17:05.772
Better come on out...

1219
01:17:07.072 --> 01:17:09.805
'cause both y'all have
an appointment...


1220
01:17:10.473 --> 01:17:12.972
to have all your little organs
taken outta


1221
01:17:13.106 --> 01:17:14.538
your skinny little bodies!

1222
01:17:33.772 --> 01:17:35.239
- He's dead.
- No.


1223
01:17:43.839 --> 01:17:45.705
Are you a good witch
or bad witch?


1224
01:17:48.339 --> 01:17:49.239
There cops out there?

1225
01:17:49.505 --> 01:17:51.306
Yeah, and we'll scream
if you try anything.


1226
01:17:51.473 --> 01:17:53.006
- No, you won't.
- Are you here to kill us?


1227
01:17:53.106 --> 01:17:55.406
No. But I need your help
getting outta here.


1228
01:17:55.638 --> 01:17:56.839
Mandy, do something, help me.

1229
01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:59.439
No, you're a fucking psychopath.
This is all your fault.


1230
01:17:59.605 --> 01:18:02.473
- It's yours.
- Just take her.


1231
01:18:02.739 --> 01:18:05.772
Thank you kindly, ma'am.
She sure is a pretty one.


1232
01:18:08.473 --> 01:18:12.505
Blonde hair and blue eyes.

1233
01:18:25.139 --> 01:18:26.406
I wasn't gonna hurt her.

1234
01:18:26.739 --> 01:18:28.705
I was just gonna use
her to get outta here.


1235
01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:32.572
You better hurry up.

1236
01:18:33.439 --> 01:18:36.672
- You girls are crazy.
- Go home, Regina.


1237
01:18:37.306 --> 01:18:39.705
Get the fuck outta here.

1238
01:18:40.672 --> 01:18:43.039
Is this gonna give me a disease?

1239
01:18:43.439 --> 01:18:45.272
No, just go home.

1240
01:18:46.439 --> 01:18:47.772
You can't wear that.

1241
01:18:48.373 --> 01:18:49.638
Take it off.

1242
01:18:50.872 --> 01:18:53.072
Am I... am I fired?

1243
01:18:53.339 --> 01:18:54.239
Oh, yeah.

1244
01:18:55.672 --> 01:18:57.839
Yeah. I... I won't tell no one.

1245
01:18:59.039 --> 01:19:00.172
I know you won't.

1246
01:19:11.672 --> 01:19:14.239
See you around, then, cuz.

1247
01:19:16.339 --> 01:19:18.805
Yeah. See ya.

1248
01:19:23.638 --> 01:19:25.272
<i>More on that in the next hour.</i>

1249
01:19:25.739 --> 01:19:27.439
<i>Our top story this
morning concerns</i>


1250
01:19:27.572 --> 01:19:29.638
<i>the three deaths reported
at the local hospital</i>


1251
01:19:29.772 --> 01:19:32.538
<i>over night, with two additional
people in critical condition.</i>


1252
01:19:33.072 --> 01:19:35.839
<i>What's now being considered
a combination of a suicide,</i>


1253
01:19:36.006 --> 01:19:38.672
<i>a potential homicide,
and a freak accident</i>


1254
01:19:38.872 --> 01:19:40.839
<i>is currently
under investigation.</i>


1255
01:19:42.538 --> 01:19:43.705
<i>The police are
on the scene now,</i>


1256
01:19:43.839 --> 01:19:46.406
<i>but due to the Y2K
preparation weekend,</i>


1257
01:19:46.538 --> 01:19:48.439
<i>much of the police force
wasn't in the area</i>


1258
01:19:48.605 --> 01:19:49.872
<i>when the events
began to unfold.</i>


1259
01:19:50.006 --> 01:19:51.772
<i>But the official statement
from the chief</i>


1260
01:19:52.139 --> 01:19:53.705
<i>is that the delays
in police arrival</i>


1261
01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.439
<i>did not contribute
to additional...</i>


1262
01:19:55.605 --> 01:19:57.006
<i>...deaths and injuries.</i>

1263
01:19:58.672 --> 01:19:59.839
<i>It's been a tragic year.</i>

1264
01:19:59.972 --> 01:20:01.638
<i>We extend our condolences
to the families</i>


1265
01:20:01.805 --> 01:20:04.206
<i>of those injured or killed
in the hospital last night.</i>


1266
01:20:04.772 --> 01:20:06.006
<i>The investigation
is still open,</i>


1267
01:20:06.139 --> 01:20:08.672
<i>but we've been informed
that the area is secure.</i>


1268
01:20:08.805 --> 01:20:11.072
<i>We'll be hearing more
from the police later today.</i>


1269
01:20:33.805 --> 01:20:38.339
I told Officer Myers all that.
And he said I was free to leave.


1270
01:20:40.672 --> 01:20:43.638
I was real sad
about Mr. Collins.


1271
01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:47.705
He just couldn't handle
being here anymore.


1272
01:20:47.839 --> 01:20:52.672
No one deserves to go that way,
but I... I think it was suicide.


1273
01:20:52.905 --> 01:20:56.905
Uh, uh. Sir,
you are not listening to me.


1274
01:20:57.306 --> 01:20:58.206
He was a madman.

1275
01:20:58.439 --> 01:20:59.805
He... he clearly killed
all these people.


1276
01:20:59.905 --> 01:21:01.939
I mean, what kind
of hospital is this?


1277
01:21:02.106 --> 01:21:04.306
Ma'am, uh,
can I get you a drink of water?


1278
01:21:04.505 --> 01:21:06.605
- Yes, you can!
- You wanna come with me?


1279
01:21:10.538 --> 01:21:12.839
She's right. He was crazy.

1280
01:21:14.905 --> 01:21:16.538
We may have some
more questions for you,


1281
01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.505
but I think I've got
all your information,


1282
01:21:18.672 --> 01:21:20.072
so you should be okay.

1283
01:21:35.373 --> 01:21:37.839
- Is everybody dead?
- No.


1284
01:21:39.406 --> 01:21:41.239
Janet may not be able
to talk for a while,


1285
01:21:41.373 --> 01:21:43.705
but that cute cop
ain't doing so good.


1286
01:21:44.905 --> 01:21:47.772
- Cute ones always die.
- You mind helping?


1287
01:21:49.239 --> 01:21:50.772
My shift just ended.

1288
01:21:51.505 --> 01:21:52.905
- Seriously?
- Yeah.


1289
01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:56.406
Don't you dare touch her.

1290
01:21:56.839 --> 01:21:59.572
I don't want anyone
in this hospital near her!


1291
01:22:00.272 --> 01:22:01.306
Are you going home?

1292
01:22:02.039 --> 01:22:05.172
No, they want me to stay
until things get settled.


1293
01:22:05.638 --> 01:22:07.505
That's a long shift for you.

1294
01:22:07.805 --> 01:22:09.772
Yeah, well,
I'm getting overtime.


1295
01:22:11.939 --> 01:22:16.872
- Uh... I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see ya.


1296
01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.039
How you doing?

1297
01:22:26.705 --> 01:22:28.206
That was very strange.

1298
01:22:28.705 --> 01:22:31.106
Why is this so small?
And this so big?


1299
01:22:31.373 --> 01:22:33.705
Who's gonna do something
with these bags that I found?


1300
01:22:33.839 --> 01:22:34.905
Who's gonna help me with this?

1301
01:22:35.239 --> 01:22:37.705
Someone gonna do something
with these bags that I found?


1302
01:22:38.373 --> 01:22:39.439
I found this one,

1303
01:22:39.572 --> 01:22:41.439
looks like they're
chock-full of organ meat.


1304
01:22:41.638 --> 01:22:43.439
I found this
at the soda machine.


1305
01:22:43.705 --> 01:22:44.905
I went down for a nice drink

1306
01:22:45.006 --> 01:22:46.905
and then I went down
again later,


1307
01:22:47.006 --> 01:22:48.406
'cause no one's seen me
for a while,


1308
01:22:48.473 --> 01:22:49.672
and then I found this one.

1309
01:22:50.172 --> 01:22:52.072
It looks like someone
was keeping them there.


1310
01:22:52.638 --> 01:22:54.139
Oh, oh, now you're gonna
pay attention.


1311
01:22:54.239 --> 01:22:56.039
- Got the organs in my hands.
- Whoa, whoa.


1312
01:22:56.139 --> 01:22:57.039
Okay, thank you.

1313
01:22:57.239 --> 01:22:59.839
This has about seven
or eight different ones inside.


1314
01:23:00.039 --> 01:23:02.638
Yeah, and I had... I kept
the soda far away, it's fine.


1315
01:23:02.705 --> 01:23:04.339
I'm a little dizzy.
You need to be very careful


1316
01:23:04.406 --> 01:23:05.538
with your hands.
