1
00:02:48.612 --> 00:02:50.236
This is the location

2
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.105
where I met and interviewed
the medical worker


3
00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:55.241
that brought us a
shocking found footage


4
00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:58.578
of government experiments
a few years ago.


5
00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.694
The world has
changed since then.


6
00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:07.921
I'm here today to look
back on what he had to say,


7
00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:10.901
and the video footage that
he wanted to warn us about.


8
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.039
Hi, and
thank you for talking to us.


9
00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:18.665
You want to keep
your identity secret,


10
00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.834
but you were there when
the outbreak started


11
00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:22.379
in the meat processing plant.

12
00:03:23.847 --> 00:03:27.317
Yes, I remember. I'm sorry.

13
00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.219
I've had a lot of
things in my mind.


14
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:33.490
Sometimes it's hard
to think straight.


15
00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:38.351
They come at night, you know?

16
00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:39.519
- Yes I know.

17
00:03:39.563 --> 00:03:41.053
We haven't got long.

18
00:03:41.097 --> 00:03:42.433
Tell us who you are.

19
00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:50.273
- I'm one of the
medical workers.


20
00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:53.800
I've lost everything.

21
00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:58.348
My children, my wife, have
left me. God I miss them.


22
00:04:00.183 --> 00:04:01.552
Nothing will stay the same.

23
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:04.555
People blame me.

24
00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:07.480
But they told me that

25
00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:09.950
everything was going
to work out okay.


26
00:04:09.994 --> 00:04:12.261
They told me I was going
to be looked after.


27
00:04:13.664 --> 00:04:18.301
But the one thing that's
for sure is the lies.


28
00:04:19.703 --> 00:04:24.307
They lied to us, all of them,
and they're still lying.


29
00:04:26.777 --> 00:04:28.379
We have very little time.

30
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.270
They will come for us.

31
00:04:31.314 --> 00:04:33.017
- You have to tell your story.

32
00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:36.285
You owe it to the people.

33
00:04:38.856 --> 00:04:41.113
Do you really need
that bottle of whiskey?


34
00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:42.048
- I'm sorry.

35
00:04:42.092 --> 00:04:43.827
I can't do without it now.

36
00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:46.329
It's all I have.

37
00:04:47.498 --> 00:04:48.955
- Tell us what happened,

38
00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.501
and how the footage was found.

39
00:04:51.435 --> 00:04:52.836
- How it started?

40
00:04:54.405 --> 00:04:55.194
Yeah.

41
00:05:16.393 --> 00:05:18.018
That's how the footage begins?

42
00:05:18.062 --> 00:05:18.852
- No, it didn't,

43
00:05:18.896 --> 00:05:19.930
it didn't start there.

44
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:23.356
We were all brought together.

45
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.637
Tactical trainee, police
teams, co-commander,


46
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:29.707
and a local camera crew.

47
00:05:30.874 --> 00:05:34.067
We were sent to a local
meat processing plant


48
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:39.116
that had an outbreak of an
unknown virus in the meat.


49
00:05:40.184 --> 00:05:43.286
The regional CDC
Officer was Dr. Fisher.


50
00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:46.490
He was there to
oversee the operation.


51
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:52.519
They thought it was a good idea

52
00:05:52.563 --> 00:05:54.865
for those local filmmakers
to film everything.


53
00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:56.867
That's how it started.

54
00:05:58.035 --> 00:06:01.337
Yeah, it started with
those local film makers.


55
00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:13.383
- Okay.

56
00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:19.179
Right, ladies and
gentlemen, Kyle Cam.


57
00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:23.183
It's freezing cold in the
middle of the countryside,


58
00:06:23.227 --> 00:06:24.050
early hours of the morning,

59
00:06:24.094 --> 00:06:26.152
and I'm waiting for Jo.

60
00:06:26.196 --> 00:06:27.687
She's late as always,

61
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:30.590
and there's nothing else I
could do apart from wait,


62
00:06:30.634 --> 00:06:31.858
and yeah, though.

63
00:06:31.902 --> 00:06:33.026
She's here now though, good.

64
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.694
Let's see if I can wind her up

65
00:06:34.738 --> 00:06:36.629
a little bit about
her being late.


66
00:06:36.673 --> 00:06:39.109
Oh lovely to know that
Jo has finally arrived,


67
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:43.235
I'll get the door
for you your majesty.


68
00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:45.237
- Thank you very much.
- Right.


69
00:06:45.281 --> 00:06:46.473
Let's get you in.
- Lock my car.


70
00:06:46.517 --> 00:06:48.908
- Oh, all the thieves
in the entire world


71
00:06:48.952 --> 00:06:51.544
are gonna want everything
that's in your car.


72
00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:54.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no bullshit.


73
00:06:54.124 --> 00:06:55.915
Let's have a look- hold on.

74
00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:58.785
What's in that bag?

75
00:06:58.829 --> 00:06:59.786
- Equipment.

76
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.020
- Look, hold that.

77
00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:02.889
Hold that against your face.

78
00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:05.225
Hold it against your
face really high.


79
00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:06.335
Ladies and gentlemen,

80
00:07:07.538 --> 00:07:11.498
Jo, the camera woman has
got this much equipment.


81
00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:12.843
- That's all I need!

82
00:07:14.444 --> 00:07:15.668
- Oh, bullshit.

83
00:07:15.712 --> 00:07:16.603
- Don't you start mate,
you've got the same bag.


84
00:07:16.647 --> 00:07:18.538
- No. Yeah, you wait and see.

85
00:07:18.582 --> 00:07:19.773
Right, let's get inside.

86
00:07:19.817 --> 00:07:21.341
It's fucking freezing
out here, let's go.


87
00:07:26.723 --> 00:07:28.948
This is nice, isn't it?

88
00:07:28.992 --> 00:07:32.218
A dreary little basement to
stick the camera crew in.


89
00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:34.387
- What the bloody
hell have you brought?


90
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:37.201
- Uh, all sorts, really. This...

91
00:07:40.737 --> 00:07:42.028
- Are you alright?

92
00:07:42.072 --> 00:07:44.230
Do you need help?
- Yes thanks. You know, fine.


93
00:07:44.274 --> 00:07:46.332
Thanks for asking.

94
00:07:46.376 --> 00:07:47.211
- Oh good.

95
00:07:49.112 --> 00:07:52.416
- Yeah, microphone.
- What have you...


96
00:07:55.285 --> 00:07:56.386
- Indoor camera,

97
00:07:59.456 --> 00:08:00.257
tripod,

98
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.018
cables and shit.

99
00:08:05.062 --> 00:08:06.619
- You'll need that one.

100
00:08:06.663 --> 00:08:08.198
- Outside camera.

101
00:08:09.132 --> 00:08:10.322
- Do you think you got enough?

102
00:08:10.366 --> 00:08:11.191
- Yeah, much more.

103
00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:12.559
You know, plenty.

104
00:08:12.603 --> 00:08:13.693
Better than your
probably little,


105
00:08:13.737 --> 00:08:14.928
little like kids' camera.

106
00:08:14.972 --> 00:08:17.430
Might as well be a toy.

107
00:08:17.474 --> 00:08:20.733
- Um, I've got more
than I need in my bag.


108
00:08:20.777 --> 00:08:21.668
Dunno what you brought.

109
00:08:21.712 --> 00:08:23.080
- Keep telling yourself that Jo.

110
00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:29.742
Fucking exhausted already.

111
00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:31.788
- We haven't even
started.


112
00:08:40.163 --> 00:08:41.754
- Okay here we go.

113
00:08:41.798 --> 00:08:43.423
Let's hope this
briefing is brief.


114
00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:45.102
- Okay. Good morning guys.

115
00:08:46.136 --> 00:08:49.495
Dr. Fisher from disease control.

116
00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:53.810
Is going to explain the
situation to you, Dr. Fisher.


117
00:08:56.213 --> 00:08:57.648
- Good morning gentlemen.

118
00:08:59.384 --> 00:09:01.908
We believe that this
contamination of meat


119
00:09:01.952 --> 00:09:03.520
is caused by an insect.

120
00:09:04.922 --> 00:09:08.058
I don't suppose any of you
have heard of Chagas disease?


121
00:09:08.892 --> 00:09:11.317
Yeah.

122
00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:14.231
- Well, that's not surprising,
it's not native to the UK.


123
00:09:15.632 --> 00:09:19.959
But Chagas, we'll give
it its full Latin name of


124
00:09:20.003 --> 00:09:22.673
Trypanosoma Cruzi, is a parasite

125
00:09:24.074 --> 00:09:26.143
which is released into
the victim's blood stream.


126
00:09:27.544 --> 00:09:29.035
But I'm not absolutely
certain it's this, I mean,


127
00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:33.473
it could also be a mutated
parasitic organism,


128
00:09:33.517 --> 00:09:36.253
such as Toxoplasma Gondii.

129
00:09:37.388 --> 00:09:39.312
An infection from that
can be obtained by


130
00:09:39.356 --> 00:09:41.725
ingestion of raw or
partly cooked meat.


131
00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:44.951
Especially pork, lamb or venison

132
00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:48.421
are containing the
toxoplasma cysts.


133
00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:51.157
But we just don't
know at this stage.


134
00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:54.627
The good news is,
it's not airborne.


135
00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:56.573
So there's no danger
to any personnel.


136
00:09:57.774 --> 00:09:58.932
It spreads like the AIDS virus.

137
00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:02.669
Unless you're bitten
or bodily fluids


138
00:10:02.713 --> 00:10:07.418
enter into your
system, absolutely
nothing to worry about.


139
00:10:08.618 --> 00:10:10.677
Once it does get
into a living body,


140
00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:13.414
these organisms multiply.

141
00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:15.581
That can have various results.

142
00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:17.384
Acute toxoplasma infection

143
00:10:17.428 --> 00:10:20.853
sometimes leads to
psychotic symptoms.


144
00:10:20.897 --> 00:10:23.656
Also, if it manages to penetrate

145
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.837
the amygdala limbic system,

146
00:10:28.473 --> 00:10:31.476
extremely violent
behavior can be seen.


147
00:10:32.809 --> 00:10:34.233
If somebody has been infected,

148
00:10:34.277 --> 00:10:38.372
there's no way of telling apart
from the flu-like symptoms


149
00:10:38.416 --> 00:10:40.317
and maybe a slight
swelling of the eyes.


150
00:10:43.854 --> 00:10:46.156
- Okay. Well thank you
very much Dr. Fisher.


151
00:10:48.158 --> 00:10:49.882
Okay, well obviously we have

152
00:10:49.926 --> 00:10:53.286
heightened security
measures here today,


153
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.655
and we always have to
think of the possibility of


154
00:10:55.699 --> 00:10:57.100
terrorist involvement.

155
00:10:58.503 --> 00:11:00.927
The operation's gonna
be in two stages.


156
00:11:00.971 --> 00:11:05.131
The first will be to
evacuate the villages


157
00:11:05.175 --> 00:11:07.266
to a pick up area.

158
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.536
The second will be
to evacuate people


159
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.139
from the meat processing plant

160
00:11:13.183 --> 00:11:15.585
so that Disease
Control can go in.


161
00:11:17.488 --> 00:11:19.679
Uniformed officers
will make contact


162
00:11:19.723 --> 00:11:22.383
and you are there
to back them up


163
00:11:22.427 --> 00:11:25.128
and to encourage
residents to leave.


164
00:11:27.297 --> 00:11:30.790
A medical team have already
been sent in with vaccine


165
00:11:30.834 --> 00:11:34.104
for people who think they
have been contaminated.


166
00:11:36.073 --> 00:11:38.231
Trojan Team will also
take an additional


167
00:11:38.275 --> 00:11:41.200
camera operator to record it.

168
00:11:41.244 --> 00:11:46.216
And well, just regard this
as a training exercise.


169
00:11:47.317 --> 00:11:48.241
Full briefing
package will be given


170
00:11:48.285 --> 00:11:50.743
to each Bronze Team Commander.

171
00:11:50.787 --> 00:11:52.022
And, that's it.

172
00:12:17.714 --> 00:12:19.005
You didn't go with them?

173
00:12:19.049 --> 00:12:20.273
- No.

174
00:12:20.317 --> 00:12:21.941
I was told to set up a perimeter

175
00:12:21.985 --> 00:12:26.756
at the edge of the Woodland of
a vaccination and test area.


176
00:12:28.692 --> 00:12:31.217
The trainee and
technical Police team


177
00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:32.563
went with the camera crew;

178
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.423
all of the cadets with
the lowest of the class.


179
00:12:36.467 --> 00:12:37.558
- Do you think they expected

180
00:12:37.602 --> 00:12:39.092
to find what they did?

181
00:12:39.136 --> 00:12:40.893
- Not a chance.

182
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.326
- This guy.
How are you doing?


183
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.228
- I ain't here to answer
your questions, man.


184
00:13:15.272 --> 00:13:17.531
- Well, I'm just doing my
job sunshine, same as you.


185
00:13:17.575 --> 00:13:18.609
- And I'm doing mine.

186
00:13:19.809 --> 00:13:23.504
- And, and you, I have
one question for you.


187
00:13:23.548 --> 00:13:24.937
- Yeah?

188
00:13:24.981 --> 00:13:26.617
- How's it feel like having
a camera on your head?


189
00:13:27.684 --> 00:13:28.875
- Don't even notice it.

190
00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:31.911
- Well it look, it looks
good. You look great.


191
00:13:31.955 --> 00:13:32.789
- Cheers.

192
00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:36.793
- Jo, they're all
a bit hesitant.


193
00:13:38.496 --> 00:13:41.399
- I can't work out if
I like them or not.


194
00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:45.202
- I think I like the,
the, the good looking one.


195
00:13:46.102 --> 00:13:47.660
- Which ones that?

196
00:13:47.704 --> 00:13:50.229
- The one, the good looking one.

197
00:13:50.273 --> 00:13:51.164
- Pretty one.

198
00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:52.399
- The pretty one.

199
00:13:52.443 --> 00:13:54.200
Not princess, but
the pretty one.


200
00:13:54.244 --> 00:13:55.536
- No, the other one.

201
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.103
I don't-
- A shotgun eh?


202
00:13:57.147 --> 00:13:58.938
- They're all a bit
too serious for me.


203
00:13:58.982 --> 00:14:00.440
- Yeah.

204
00:14:00.484 --> 00:14:02.842
- Maggot. You normally
get operations like this?


205
00:14:02.886 --> 00:14:05.745
- Nope. This is my first
one actually doing this.


206
00:14:05.789 --> 00:14:06.580
- Your first?

207
00:14:06.624 --> 00:14:07.747
- Mmhmm.

208
00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:09.416
- Is it just you
that's your first? Or?


209
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.883
- No, no. The other two guys.

210
00:14:10.927 --> 00:14:13.219
It's their first time too.

211
00:14:13.263 --> 00:14:14.655
- Oh, yeah.

212
00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:16.733
- Just done two years since
training up in London.


213
00:14:18.068 --> 00:14:21.093
Pretty much training
for a moment like this.


214
00:14:21.137 --> 00:14:22.094
- Well that seems all right.

215
00:14:22.138 --> 00:14:23.597
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

216
00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:26.098
- We need to get you, Maggot,
with the rest of the group.


217
00:14:26.142 --> 00:14:27.334
I need some more shots of that,

218
00:14:27.378 --> 00:14:29.769
because I know she's beautiful.

219
00:14:29.813 --> 00:14:31.338
You're beautiful.

220
00:14:31.382 --> 00:14:33.806
Put your gun away,
'cause I need...


221
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.241
- I'll just stay at the
back and keep watch.


222
00:14:35.285 --> 00:14:36.142
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:14:36.186 --> 00:14:37.521
Oh yeah, yeah yeah.

224
00:14:38.589 --> 00:14:41.847
C'mon Joseph,
Josephine, Jo- Joseline?


225
00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:42.848
I dunno.
- Who are you talking to?


226
00:14:42.892 --> 00:14:44.250
- Jo?

227
00:14:44.294 --> 00:14:45.463
- You're getting all involved?

228
00:14:47.063 --> 00:14:48.187
- It's my job.

229
00:14:48.231 --> 00:14:50.357
It's my job to
document everything.


230
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:51.857
Every single thing around.

231
00:14:51.901 --> 00:14:53.493
- Same as mine, but I'm not
getting in your business.


232
00:14:53.537 --> 00:14:54.727
- Look, all right?

233
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:57.196
You might think that you
are my boss right now,


234
00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.043
but at the moment, you're not.

235
00:15:02.112 --> 00:15:04.605
I've got a camera.
You've got a camera.


236
00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:06.906
We're all filming our
babes in the wood.


237
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.675
- It's not a good
idea to piss off a man


238
00:15:08.719 --> 00:15:10.176
when he's armed, you know?

239
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.811
Oh, it's not like you're
going to shoot a civilian.


240
00:15:11.855 --> 00:15:13.990
I'm not worried mate,
don't worry about it.


241
00:15:37.347 --> 00:15:39.038
When you saw the footage,

242
00:15:39.082 --> 00:15:41.240
did you think it was real?

243
00:15:41.284 --> 00:15:44.277
I'm not a person that

244
00:15:44.321 --> 00:15:46.956
watches reality, constructed TV.

245
00:15:49.859 --> 00:15:52.763
I knew what I was seeing
for God's sake, I lived it.


246
00:15:55.198 --> 00:15:57.000
I just never
realized the outcome.


247
00:15:58.469 --> 00:16:02.473
Why would you? Wonder where
are the bad guys out there?


248
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.666
We live in the world
where we believe


249
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.143
what our governments say.

250
00:16:08.845 --> 00:16:12.450
Everything the foreign
government says


251
00:16:13.517 --> 00:16:15.419
we achieve by mistrust.

252
00:16:16.853 --> 00:16:18.288
They are the bad guys.

253
00:16:20.825 --> 00:16:25.117
Well, our governments, we
believe, are the good ones.


254
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:27.364
They do what's best
for the people.


255
00:16:28.466 --> 00:16:29.899
Who would think otherwise?

256
00:16:32.369 --> 00:16:35.004
But if only we realize that
government's made of men.


257
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.578
Men are corrupt.
Men of any country.


258
00:16:41.746 --> 00:16:43.179
- Did our government lie?

259
00:16:45.982 --> 00:16:50.320
- A man cares about
one thing. Power.


260
00:16:51.722 --> 00:16:55.214
Governments are just people.
Do you understand that?


261
00:16:55.258 --> 00:16:57.428
We're all just people.

262
00:16:58.829 --> 00:17:02.265
How many people do you trust
in your life? How many?


263
00:17:03.734 --> 00:17:07.971
People that won't hurt
you, rob you, cheat you.


264
00:17:09.205 --> 00:17:10.875
You know what I'm
saying is true.


265
00:17:12.976 --> 00:17:16.336
But we trust what
we see on the TV.


266
00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.785
It's all so fucking
true.


267
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.845
TV common myth.

268
00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:28.749
They never lied to us.
Never cheateth, do they?


269
00:17:28.793 --> 00:17:30.260
- Did you lie to us?

270
00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:34.164
- I told the
truth as I saw it.

271
00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:19.965
- Let's go up ahead a
bit, get some shots.


272
00:18:20.009 --> 00:18:21.735
- Wasn't there
meant someone meetin' us?


273
00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:22.613
- I dunno.

274
00:18:30.286 --> 00:18:32.913
- It looks deserted.
Where is everyone?


275
00:18:32.957 --> 00:18:34.959
- It doesn't
surprise me one bit.


276
00:18:46.302 --> 00:18:47.270
- Is this it?

277
00:18:50.774 --> 00:18:54.812
- Strange. Should be
someone here to meet us.


278
00:18:57.046 --> 00:18:59.148
- Where do you think
they've got to?


279
00:19:02.118 --> 00:19:03.343
- Who's
supposed to be here?


280
00:19:03.387 --> 00:19:04.778
- Supposed to be?

281
00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:08.214
Some head guys here.
They're not here.


282
00:19:08.258 --> 00:19:09.960
- This isn't normal is it?

283
00:19:11.428 --> 00:19:13.497
- Get you settled in. You
aint gettin' through that.


284
00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:18.201
- All right. You
go round that side.


285
00:19:21.438 --> 00:19:22.439
You take the right.

286
00:19:25.275 --> 00:19:27.176
- What's going on?

287
00:19:29.178 --> 00:19:31.270
- Control from Trojan One.

288
00:19:31.314 --> 00:19:34.407
No visible sign of
civilians to gain access


289
00:19:34.451 --> 00:19:36.141
to meat processing plant.

290
00:19:36.185 --> 00:19:39.613
Request permission to gain
access through breaching doors


291
00:19:39.657 --> 00:19:41.291
or maintain position over.

292
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.051
- Control to Trojan one. You
have permission to proceed.


293
00:19:46.095 --> 00:19:47.631
- Okay, been advised, out.

294
00:19:50.935 --> 00:19:53.037
- Located an entrance
about 50 yards down.


295
00:19:54.203 --> 00:19:55.962
- Nothing on
the right hand side.


296
00:19:56.006 --> 00:19:56.840
- Okay.

297
00:19:58.442 --> 00:20:01.033
- We've been given full
clearance by Silver.


298
00:20:01.077 --> 00:20:02.469
We dunno what to expect.

299
00:20:02.513 --> 00:20:04.971
If we encounter any
resistance from civilians,


300
00:20:05.015 --> 00:20:06.316
we use hand tactics.

301
00:23:27.518 --> 00:23:29.109
- I don't like wood.

302
00:23:29.153 --> 00:23:31.745
I've decided there's
way too many.


303
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:32.679
No!

304
00:23:32.723 --> 00:23:33.913
- What do you mean by that?

305
00:23:33.957 --> 00:23:35.849
- There's- No. There's
way too many leaves.


306
00:23:35.893 --> 00:23:37.016
Leaves? Trees.
- There's lots and lots


307
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.451
of wood around here.

308
00:23:39.328 --> 00:23:40.164
Where were you born?

309
00:23:41.098 --> 00:23:41.988
- In the city.

310
00:23:42.032 --> 00:23:43.189
- In the city. There we go.

311
00:23:43.233 --> 00:23:44.424
So you've never seen a,

312
00:23:44.468 --> 00:23:46.760
like a nice big rustic
countryside before.


313
00:23:46.804 --> 00:23:48.238
These guys aren't used to it.

314
00:23:52.676 --> 00:23:54.167
- How long they gonna be?

315
00:23:54.211 --> 00:23:55.935
- I have no idea, they
could be any number of time.


316
00:23:55.979 --> 00:23:58.705
If we're not allowed in there,
we're not allowed in there,


317
00:23:58.749 --> 00:24:00.607
but just be ready.

318
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:01.741
Ready on camera.

319
00:24:01.785 --> 00:24:02.976
When they come out of here,

320
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.345
get up in their face,
ask 'em some questions,


321
00:24:05.389 --> 00:24:07.113
find out what they saw.

322
00:24:07.157 --> 00:24:08.047
- All right.

323
00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:09.549
- That's what we're after.

324
00:24:09.593 --> 00:24:11.195
- Well, let's hope they're soon.

325
00:24:12.796 --> 00:24:14.254
- All right.
- Absolute bollocks,


326
00:24:14.298 --> 00:24:15.755
what are we doin' here?

327
00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:18.358
Hey, what are we doing?
A complete waste of time.


328
00:24:18.402 --> 00:24:19.793
- What did
you see in there?


329
00:24:19.837 --> 00:24:21.261
- Not a lot mate.

330
00:24:21.305 --> 00:24:23.830
There wasn't a lot to see.
All a bit fuckin' odd.


331
00:24:23.874 --> 00:24:25.031
- Look at us all. Look at us.

332
00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:26.866
Look, fuckin' helmets,
cameras on them.


333
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:28.067
- Princess.
- Guns, everything.


334
00:24:28.111 --> 00:24:29.669
Look at all this fuckin' armor.

335
00:24:29.713 --> 00:24:31.303
Why do we get dressed
up for, right?


336
00:24:31.347 --> 00:24:32.906
We go there, there's
nothing there!


337
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:33.973
It's a waste of fuckin' time!

338
00:24:34.017 --> 00:24:35.008
- Princess, can you just

339
00:24:35.052 --> 00:24:36.376
answer my question for a second?

340
00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.511
What's got you so riled up mate?

341
00:24:38.555 --> 00:24:39.389
- You can fuck off.

342
00:24:40.724 --> 00:24:42.182
Were you surprised

343
00:24:42.226 --> 00:24:44.628
they found nothing at the
meat processing plant?


344
00:24:46.997 --> 00:24:48.922
We were told there would be

345
00:24:48.966 --> 00:24:50.290
unexpected problems.

346
00:24:50.334 --> 00:24:52.158
- Unexpected problems?

347
00:24:52.202 --> 00:24:54.594
- That's what they called it.

348
00:24:54.638 --> 00:24:56.139
People look at me now and say,

349
00:24:57.541 --> 00:24:59.666
"You must have known
what was going on."


350
00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.668
"He must have known."

351
00:25:01.712 --> 00:25:04.381
But we were just doing
our jobs with no question.


352
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:08.708
And that is what we do.

353
00:25:08.752 --> 00:25:11.221
- Were you monitoring
the live video footage?


354
00:25:12.322 --> 00:25:13.156
- No.

355
00:25:14.491 --> 00:25:18.528
I never saw it 'til much
later, until it was discovered.


356
00:25:20.898 --> 00:25:24.591
As I said, it was just our jobs.

357
00:25:24.635 --> 00:25:28.027
We were told it was
some parasite or virus


358
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:30.263
that may have
infected the workers


359
00:25:30.307 --> 00:25:31.742
at the meat processing plant.

360
00:25:33.176 --> 00:25:35.668
But we did what we were
told, that's all we knew.


361
00:25:35.712 --> 00:25:37.470
- And what were you
told about the workers


362
00:25:37.514 --> 00:25:40.951
at the meat processing plant
and why they had disappeared?


363
00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:44.588
- Look, I just did my job.

364
00:25:45.722 --> 00:25:47.057
What do you want me to say?

365
00:25:52.729 --> 00:25:55.432
I don't want you
blaming me for anything.


366
00:25:57.234 --> 00:25:59.826
Do you know what I've lost?

367
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.672
Everything. Everything!

368
00:26:03.707 --> 00:26:07.467
Do you know how that
feels? Do you? Do you?


369
00:26:07.511 --> 00:26:08.812
- I didn't mean to offend.

370
00:26:10.747 --> 00:26:12.449
Please tell me
what happened next.


371
00:26:27.432 --> 00:26:30.023
- Control from Trojan
one. We have a 10-26.


372
00:26:30.067 --> 00:26:31.858
No one here.

373
00:26:31.902 --> 00:26:33.493
No visible sign of any personnel

374
00:26:33.537 --> 00:26:35.672
in the meat processing
plant, over.


375
00:26:38.443 --> 00:26:41.511
Control Trojan one, over.

376
00:26:44.281 --> 00:26:45.882
Composite down check your radio.

377
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.251
- Control from Trojan one.

378
00:26:49.619 --> 00:26:51.488
Control from Trojan
one, do you copy?


379
00:26:52.522 --> 00:26:53.746
- Right.

380
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.981
Get up top so you can
get reception up there


381
00:26:55.025 --> 00:26:57.984
and meet us at the
pickup point, okay?


382
00:26:58.028 --> 00:27:00.486
Control Trojan one,
we have a 10-7.


383
00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:03.890
We cannot read you. We are
going onto the pickup point.


384
00:27:03.934 --> 00:27:05.168
Okay, let's go.

385
00:27:06.536 --> 00:27:07.894
- Okay Kyle, come on!

386
00:27:07.938 --> 00:27:09.373
- Yeah, yes, sir, sir.

387
00:27:13.777 --> 00:27:15.168
- God, something
consistently rubbish about


388
00:27:15.212 --> 00:27:17.603
moving through the woods
with these particular people.


389
00:27:17.647 --> 00:27:21.975
Carrying a camera the size of
my bloody skull on my back.


390
00:27:22.019 --> 00:27:22.809
- Shut up.

391
00:27:22.853 --> 00:27:24.010
- Yeah, you can shut up.

392
00:27:24.054 --> 00:27:25.689
- Keep up, you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


393
00:27:38.403 --> 00:27:39.292
- Jo, look, I'm curious.

394
00:27:39.336 --> 00:27:41.260
How did you get this demotion?

395
00:27:41.304 --> 00:27:45.832
- Well, my boyfriend- or
boyfriend at the time-


396
00:27:45.876 --> 00:27:50.347
and his dad was high up in the
government, got me the job.


397
00:27:51.548 --> 00:27:55.986
But you know, after
the breakup he made,


398
00:27:57.455 --> 00:27:59.490
like everything quite
that much difficult.


399
00:28:01.091 --> 00:28:06.096
So you know, I, I
enjoyed this job and then


400
00:28:07.264 --> 00:28:09.822
now look where I
am, here with you.


401
00:28:09.866 --> 00:28:11.268
Fuck you.

402
00:28:15.739 --> 00:28:16.763
Oh bollocks.

403
00:28:16.807 --> 00:28:18.097
Jo, my battery's running low.

404
00:28:18.141 --> 00:28:19.599
- Battery?
- Yeah.


405
00:28:19.643 --> 00:28:20.545
Do you have any spares?

406
00:28:22.846 --> 00:28:25.372
- We only have three
left mind. Here you go.


407
00:28:25.416 --> 00:28:26.616
- Thank you.
- All right, come on.


408
00:28:27.884 --> 00:28:29.075
- You know, I'm
thinkin' I should invest


409
00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:32.211
maybe some, like,
long live-ing- fuck.


410
00:28:32.255 --> 00:28:33.946
Long-lasting batteries,

411
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.248
because the ones that
I use at the moment


412
00:28:35.292 --> 00:28:37.384
just keep running out so fast.

413
00:28:37.428 --> 00:28:38.785
The bigger the camera gets,

414
00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:42.489
the more energy it
consumes and the fast...


415
00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:45.892
You know like,
batteries aren't cheap.


416
00:28:45.936 --> 00:28:47.461
Wish they were cheap.

417
00:28:47.505 --> 00:28:48.573
Like you.
- Shut up.


418
00:28:56.079 --> 00:28:57.870
- It's my sister!

419
00:28:57.914 --> 00:28:59.272
I don't know! I
haven't seen her!


420
00:28:59.316 --> 00:29:00.640
- Jo, what's she want?

421
00:29:00.684 --> 00:29:01.874
- Where are you going?

422
00:29:01.918 --> 00:29:03.109
- You've got to help
me! I just don't know!


423
00:29:03.153 --> 00:29:04.344
- No, no
no no. Just stay-


424
00:29:04.388 --> 00:29:05.479
Stay where you are!

425
00:29:05.523 --> 00:29:07.481
- Come on.
- It's down here!


426
00:29:07.525 --> 00:29:09.383
- Guys get over here,
this woman needs our help!


427
00:29:09.427 --> 00:29:10.260
Come on!

428
00:29:13.263 --> 00:29:14.097
Fuck's sake.

429
00:29:15.665 --> 00:29:18.858
Come on guys.

430
00:29:18.902 --> 00:29:22.496
- Come on. Where are we
going? Where's your sister?


431
00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.197
It's this way!

432
00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:27.100
- This- This
isn't a good idea Jo.


433
00:29:29.179 --> 00:29:30.714
God I'm fit.

434
00:29:32.716 --> 00:29:33.507
How do you think

435
00:29:33.551 --> 00:29:34.385
they felt at this point?

436
00:29:35.719 --> 00:29:36.876
- I wasn't there.

437
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.988
I dunno how it felt.

438
00:29:39.557 --> 00:29:40.525
I could only guess,

439
00:29:41.925 --> 00:29:45.118
but they must have known
that something wasn't right.


440
00:29:45.162 --> 00:29:47.398
That everything for them
was going to change.


441
00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:51.935
It's okay looking
back in retrospect.


442
00:29:53.404 --> 00:29:56.762
But I think they knew that
something was transpiring.


443
00:29:56.806 --> 00:29:58.509
Something different
was happening.


444
00:29:59.644 --> 00:30:02.547
Something stranger than
anyone could expect.


445
00:30:23.867 --> 00:30:25.825
- Kyle stay
here, don't film.


446
00:30:25.869 --> 00:30:28.004
- Well, I, I'd
rather keep filming.


447
00:30:33.477 --> 00:30:34.967
Who's this?

448
00:30:35.011 --> 00:30:38.639
- John! John? He wasn't
here earlier I don't know!


449
00:30:38.683 --> 00:30:39.872
He wasn't here earlier!

450
00:30:39.916 --> 00:30:41.642
- Kyle I told you to stay out.

451
00:30:41.686 --> 00:30:44.310
- No, I think needs
to be documented.


452
00:30:47.824 --> 00:30:49.949
- Are you all right?

453
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:54.120
- What's wrong with him?

454
00:30:54.164 --> 00:30:56.722
- John. John! John.

455
00:30:56.766 --> 00:30:57.957
Who is he?

456
00:30:58.001 --> 00:31:00.460
- He works in the
meat factories. Yeah.


457
00:31:00.504 --> 00:31:01.294
- John!

458
00:31:01.338 --> 00:31:02.596
We all live around here.

459
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.130
- I didn't mean to
hurt her, I'm sorry.


460
00:31:04.174 --> 00:31:05.532
- It's all right, calm down.

461
00:31:05.576 --> 00:31:06.466
- Calm down.

462
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.634
- Sorry I didn't mean to.

463
00:31:07.678 --> 00:31:09.068
What's he talking about?

464
00:31:09.112 --> 00:31:10.269
- I don't know!

465
00:31:10.313 --> 00:31:12.606
- All right, calm.

466
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.408
Just stay there,

467
00:31:14.452 --> 00:31:16.142
everything will be fine.

468
00:31:16.186 --> 00:31:18.277
- It's all fine, it's all fuck-

469
00:31:18.321 --> 00:31:19.680
It's not fine at all!

470
00:31:19.724 --> 00:31:22.449
- Calm down John. Calm.

471
00:31:22.493 --> 00:31:23.983
This is not helping
the situation!


472
00:31:24.027 --> 00:31:26.886
You need to calm!

473
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.754
- Do you understand me?

474
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:33.926
- Get off!

475
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:35.194
- And stay down!

476
00:31:35.238 --> 00:31:36.363
- You need to
keep away from him!


477
00:31:36.407 --> 00:31:37.464
He's, he's crazy!
- Stay down!


478
00:31:37.508 --> 00:31:38.409
Stay down!

479
00:31:39.577 --> 00:31:41.368
I will bat you. You move
to me, I will bat you!


480
00:31:41.412 --> 00:31:42.902
Do not do it!

481
00:31:42.946 --> 00:31:44.170
John! Calm!

482
00:31:48.084 --> 00:31:50.711
Right. We're
getting out of here.


483
00:31:50.755 --> 00:31:51.678
Right, get her up on her feet.

484
00:31:51.722 --> 00:31:52.512
- No.

485
00:31:52.556 --> 00:31:54.013
- Yes.

486
00:31:55.292 --> 00:31:56.082
- Please get up.

487
00:31:56.126 --> 00:31:57.316
- Yes. Right.

488
00:32:08.739 --> 00:32:09.573
Out!

489
00:32:11.941 --> 00:32:15.001
- Jo, go! Follow me!

490
00:32:15.045 --> 00:32:17.770
- I forgot my camera! Kyle
I need to go get my camera!


491
00:32:17.814 --> 00:32:19.316
- Just be careful.

492
00:32:23.721 --> 00:32:25.445
Jo grab the fucking camera
get your ass back here!


493
00:32:25.489 --> 00:32:26.747
Come on we're
getting out of here!


494
00:32:30.461 --> 00:32:31.961
I'm already far ahead of you!

495
00:33:12.869 --> 00:33:13.660
- We're lagging
behind, we better keep up.


496
00:33:13.704 --> 00:33:15.127
- Yeah fuck it.

497
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:16.829
I mean, it's not like we're
gonna get too far behind


498
00:33:16.873 --> 00:33:18.632
from anywhere,
they're not that far.


499
00:33:18.676 --> 00:33:20.801
- Well they're not
hard to miss anyway,


500
00:33:20.845 --> 00:33:22.301
in that uniform.

501
00:33:22.345 --> 00:33:23.537
- Yeah, they're
packing some serious heat


502
00:33:23.581 --> 00:33:25.372
that's for sure.

503
00:33:25.416 --> 00:33:26.606
- Yeah.

504
00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:29.909
- God, the camera's
all right at least.


505
00:33:29.953 --> 00:33:31.445
- Are you okay?

506
00:33:31.489 --> 00:33:33.491
- I'll be fine. Phew!

507
00:33:34.725 --> 00:33:36.048
Okay.

508
00:33:36.092 --> 00:33:38.785
Scare number one down.

509
00:33:38.829 --> 00:33:40.953
- I think there's worse
things to worry about,


510
00:33:40.997 --> 00:33:42.154
to be quite honest.

511
00:33:42.198 --> 00:33:44.056
- I wouldn't worry
too much about it Jo.


512
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.360
I mean, you hear all
sorts of stuff like this


513
00:33:46.404 --> 00:33:48.961
on the news reports happening
with people going a bit mental


514
00:33:49.005 --> 00:33:51.832
with those bugs, viruses, flu.

515
00:33:51.876 --> 00:33:53.800
I mean, that's practically
what the AIDS virus


516
00:33:53.844 --> 00:33:56.102
was in the first
place, you know?


517
00:33:56.146 --> 00:33:57.671
- These, these people are crazy.

518
00:33:57.715 --> 00:33:59.473
Like...
- Yeah.


519
00:33:59.517 --> 00:34:03.209
But so are people with
rabies, Jo, you know?


520
00:34:03.253 --> 00:34:04.143
- Yeah but...

521
00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:06.145
- People with rabies are crazy.

522
00:34:06.189 --> 00:34:07.079
- These
- No-

523
00:34:07.123 --> 00:34:08.948
- Not people, like dogs or like-

524
00:34:08.992 --> 00:34:09.827
mind your head.

525
00:34:10.694 --> 00:34:11.984
Because there's lots of uh...

526
00:34:12.028 --> 00:34:12.863
- Thank you.

527
00:34:14.164 --> 00:34:17.967
That woman, like,
that was not normal.


528
00:34:19.002 --> 00:34:20.326
The way that was all...

529
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.530
- Jo, define normal for me.

530
00:34:23.574 --> 00:34:24.731
- Well, it's not you.

531
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:26.877
- But define normal.

532
00:34:28.077 --> 00:34:30.437
- Well, it's definitely
not someone going crazy.


533
00:34:30.481 --> 00:34:32.506
- People with bipolar go crazy.

534
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.906
Whether it's a virus or not.

535
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:36.041
People with schizophrenia,
that's normality,


536
00:34:36.085 --> 00:34:37.477
but it's still a mental illness.

537
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:38.845
They're just ill, okay?

538
00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.448
- Do you reckon these
could be like parasites


539
00:34:41.492 --> 00:34:43.427
or something getting
into their brain?


540
00:34:44.728 --> 00:34:46.185
- Yeah, sure.

541
00:34:46.229 --> 00:34:48.254
I think maybe you've been
reading too much on the,


542
00:34:48.298 --> 00:34:49.132
on the internet.

543
00:34:57.708 --> 00:34:58.832
- Get that?

544
00:34:58.876 --> 00:35:00.076
- Uh, yeah.

545
00:35:01.445 --> 00:35:02.836
Yeah, guys look, I don't want-

546
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.404
I don't mean to be the bearer
of bad news or anything,


547
00:35:04.448 --> 00:35:07.306
but that sounded an
awful lot like a scream.


548
00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.508
- What you're
getting scared Kyle?


549
00:35:08.552 --> 00:35:10.042
- Yeah. Yeah, of course
I'm getting scared.


550
00:35:10.086 --> 00:35:13.112
There's a derelict like meat
processing plant back there


551
00:35:13.156 --> 00:35:14.925
and we are all acting cap...
- Remain calm.


552
00:35:28.506 --> 00:35:29.339
- Fuck this.

553
00:35:39.583 --> 00:35:41.351
- All right let's carry on.

554
00:35:42.853 --> 00:35:45.946
- What the boys in blue
seem to be forgetting though-


555
00:35:47.391 --> 00:35:48.849
that we've only got
cameras to defend ourselves


556
00:35:48.893 --> 00:35:51.317
against those, like
those screaming sisters


557
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:53.386
back in the house
whereas they are armed


558
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.331
to their fucking teeth.

559
00:35:59.837 --> 00:36:02.338
- Please
tell us what happened next.


560
00:36:03.641 --> 00:36:04.865
- Well, all we know

561
00:36:04.909 --> 00:36:06.833
was there was a virus
infecting the workers


562
00:36:06.877 --> 00:36:08.846
at the meat processing plant.

563
00:36:10.046 --> 00:36:11.982
You're told things,
you're given things.


564
00:36:13.116 --> 00:36:15.118
It's how it is at the CDC.

565
00:36:16.687 --> 00:36:19.278
No one knows anything,

566
00:36:19.322 --> 00:36:22.493
but we all think
we know everything.


567
00:36:23.694 --> 00:36:24.762
So clever we are.

568
00:36:26.129 --> 00:36:30.734
So well informed, so
powerful to the people.


569
00:36:31.869 --> 00:36:34.026
- I don't want to be rude,

570
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.440
but you're not answering
my questions directly.


571
00:36:38.742 --> 00:36:41.412
- I drink two liters
of whiskey a day.


572
00:36:42.913 --> 00:36:45.015
My life has been ripped apart.

573
00:36:45.883 --> 00:36:47.150
What else do you need?

574
00:36:52.489 --> 00:36:53.691
- So what happened next?

575
00:36:57.795 --> 00:37:01.264
- Look, can we stop this
interview for a moment?


576
00:38:22.713 --> 00:38:24.269
- Jo?

577
00:38:24.313 --> 00:38:26.383
Oh fuck. Just stay there.

578
00:40:03.447 --> 00:40:05.772
- Control from Trojan one,
control from Trojan one.


579
00:40:05.816 --> 00:40:07.040
We have a 10-7.

580
00:40:07.084 --> 00:40:09.386
If you can read me, we
have multiple deaths.


581
00:40:13.257 --> 00:40:14.091
- Great.

582
00:40:15.526 --> 00:40:17.784
That's, that's just perfect.
- Control from Trojan one,


583
00:40:17.828 --> 00:40:19.897
We are heading back
to the briefing area.


584
00:40:43.453 --> 00:40:44.353
- God.

585
00:40:45.522 --> 00:40:48.725
- This is absolutely
fucking mental.


586
00:42:03.867 --> 00:42:06.860
- Jo, keep behind me.

587
00:42:06.904 --> 00:42:09.573
But make sure you
keep on filming.


588
00:42:34.197 --> 00:42:36.066
- Stay where you are!

589
00:42:41.638 --> 00:42:44.197
Maggot, get back!

590
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:45.498
Don't get close.

591
00:42:45.542 --> 00:42:46.843
Don't move back!

592
00:42:47.744 --> 00:42:49.903
Maggot, lower your guns!

593
00:42:52.316 --> 00:42:55.018
- Completely
different from last time...


594
00:43:03.727 --> 00:43:05.796
- Are you okay?

595
00:43:09.132 --> 00:43:10.567
- Jesus!

596
00:43:14.805 --> 00:43:15.995
- Fucking stay back!

597
00:43:16.039 --> 00:43:17.007
- Keep that
bitch away from me.


598
00:43:20.277 --> 00:43:21.234
- Fucking noise.

599
00:43:23.847 --> 00:43:24.681
- Guns!

600
00:43:28.685 --> 00:43:29.709
- Kyle?

601
00:43:29.753 --> 00:43:31.511
Shh!

602
00:43:31.555 --> 00:43:32.912
- Where's that?

603
00:43:32.956 --> 00:43:34.791
- What the hell...

604
00:43:36.226 --> 00:43:37.127
- Okay, Jo?

605
00:43:38.161 --> 00:43:39.752
We need to go back.

606
00:43:47.405 --> 00:43:48.995
- The fuck...

607
00:43:49.039 --> 00:43:51.041
- Fucking loads of them!

608
00:43:53.444 --> 00:43:55.301
- Just...

609
00:43:55.345 --> 00:43:59.349
Just standing there like
dotted around the woods.


610
00:44:08.859 --> 00:44:09.494
- Fucking hell
they're coming out everywhere!


611
00:44:12.195 --> 00:44:12.952
Get back, get back!
- Kyle...


612
00:44:12.996 --> 00:44:14.153
- Kyle, get back!

613
00:44:19.536 --> 00:44:21.627
Get back, who are you?

614
00:44:21.671 --> 00:44:22.672
Who are you!

615
00:44:23.807 --> 00:44:24.641
Get back!

616
00:44:26.343 --> 00:44:27.934
Get back!

617
00:44:27.978 --> 00:44:29.702
I told you to fucking get back!

618
00:44:31.915 --> 00:44:33.973
- Sir! Sir
there's more of them!


619
00:44:34.017 --> 00:44:35.085
They're coming from everywhere!

620
00:44:36.686 --> 00:44:38.277
- Get back!

621
00:44:38.321 --> 00:44:40.414
Go on get back!

622
00:44:40.458 --> 00:44:41.348
Stay where you are!

623
00:44:41.392 --> 00:44:42.281
- Shit...

624
00:44:42.325 --> 00:44:44.650
- Stay where you are!

625
00:44:46.397 --> 00:44:47.230
Get back!

626
00:44:52.302 --> 00:44:55.094
- Sir what do we do?

627
00:44:58.608 --> 00:45:00.367
- Fucking loads of them!

628
00:45:03.914 --> 00:45:05.315
Fuck out of here!

629
00:45:27.704 --> 00:45:29.929
- Kyle we
need to get inside!


630
00:45:29.973 --> 00:45:30.807
Come on!

631
00:45:38.014 --> 00:45:38.905
- From a virus

632
00:45:38.949 --> 00:45:40.083
to zombie-like meat workers?

633
00:45:41.818 --> 00:45:43.142
Am I missing anything?

634
00:45:43.186 --> 00:45:44.077
- It just shows you

635
00:45:44.121 --> 00:45:45.556
how quickly things can evolve.

636
00:45:46.723 --> 00:45:48.214
One minute you're
choosing the dinner


637
00:45:48.258 --> 00:45:49.693
you have on your table,

638
00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.752
What vegetables, your meat.

639
00:45:52.796 --> 00:45:56.534
And then suddenly,
the disturbing future


640
00:45:57.435 --> 00:45:59.826
that's totally alien to you.

641
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:01.371
- I have to ask you once more.

642
00:46:03.474 --> 00:46:05.242
Did you know about
this beforehand?


643
00:46:06.511 --> 00:46:09.179
- Fuck you. It's easy to blame.

644
00:46:10.581 --> 00:46:12.539
Look at your history.

645
00:46:12.583 --> 00:46:16.853
And you, you have to ask
yourself who really is to blame?


646
00:46:18.456 --> 00:46:20.190
Who brought about
the Nazi party?


647
00:46:21.592 --> 00:46:24.595
Was it Hitler, or the
people that let it happen?


648
00:46:27.498 --> 00:46:29.822
We knew something wasn't right.

649
00:46:29.866 --> 00:46:31.101
We signed up for it.

650
00:46:34.572 --> 00:46:35.573
But you don't blame.

651
00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:43.002
You believe in the ones,

652
00:46:43.046 --> 00:46:46.806
the ones that have
the power, to control.


653
00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:48.040
- I find it hard to believe

654
00:46:48.084 --> 00:46:50.120
you didn't know
what was going on.


655
00:46:51.188 --> 00:46:52.088
- Fuck you.

656
00:46:55.493 --> 00:46:56.693
This interview is over.

657
00:47:09.172 --> 00:47:10.663
- Yo Princess,
where is everyone mate?


658
00:47:10.707 --> 00:47:14.834
About two hours ago, there
was a room full of people.


659
00:47:14.878 --> 00:47:17.670
And from what I've
just seen out there,


660
00:47:17.714 --> 00:47:22.108
I'm willing to bet very
safely that they're outside,


661
00:47:22.152 --> 00:47:26.356
either with them, or
struggling hard against them.


662
00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:32.285
Princess?

663
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:33.620
- Kyle do you not think you
should put that camera down now?


664
00:47:33.664 --> 00:47:35.321
- No, I think now
more than ever,


665
00:47:35.365 --> 00:47:37.391
I should be filming because
if this, if this gets out...


666
00:47:37.435 --> 00:47:40.226
- This ain't no normal
situation we're dealing with.


667
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:41.060
- Chris.

668
00:47:41.104 --> 00:47:42.172
- It's all clear, sir.

669
00:47:45.942 --> 00:47:47.133
- Where is everyone?

670
00:47:47.177 --> 00:47:48.635
- Well, they're
just upped and left.


671
00:47:48.679 --> 00:47:49.570
Upped and left.

672
00:47:49.614 --> 00:47:51.338
It's you know, we came in here.

673
00:47:51.382 --> 00:47:54.608
Jo, back in the woods.

674
00:47:54.652 --> 00:47:56.075
You were saying about
all those incidents


675
00:47:56.119 --> 00:47:59.413
where people had
gone crazy and stuff.


676
00:47:59.457 --> 00:48:00.458
And I was like, pssh.

677
00:48:03.026 --> 00:48:06.118
There was that incident on
the news wasn't it like,


678
00:48:06.162 --> 00:48:08.622
that guy that ripped
that fella's face off.


679
00:48:08.666 --> 00:48:10.089
And when the police came by,

680
00:48:10.133 --> 00:48:12.526
they shot him and he
didn't go down after like,


681
00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:15.795
fuckin' like a whole
empty magazine into him.


682
00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:17.029
- I said that to you.

683
00:48:17.073 --> 00:48:18.164
- Yeah, yeah, and
I dismissed it,


684
00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:19.566
but I'm just saying now.

685
00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:20.877
- Now you believe me.

686
00:48:52.543 --> 00:48:56.112
- Right, nobody else is gonna
ask it, I might as well.


687
00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.883
What the hell just
happened out there?


688
00:49:14.998 --> 00:49:15.988
- What?

689
00:49:16.032 --> 00:49:17.568
- What the fuck happened?

690
00:49:18.602 --> 00:49:20.003
Who was that woman?

691
00:49:21.539 --> 00:49:22.629
Who, who, who are they?

692
00:49:22.673 --> 00:49:23.840
What are they?

693
00:49:25.509 --> 00:49:26.932
- Well, you know what?

694
00:49:26.976 --> 00:49:29.869
Maybe now is the time for
more answers of yours,


695
00:49:29.913 --> 00:49:31.549
your fucking questions.

696
00:49:33.651 --> 00:49:35.486
Maybe we all just
need to calm down.


697
00:49:47.297 --> 00:49:48.965
What we gonna do if he is?

698
00:49:51.736 --> 00:49:54.461
- It seems to me you
weren't quite answering,


699
00:49:54.505 --> 00:49:55.961
but asking your damn questions.

700
00:49:56.005 --> 00:49:57.163
- Look.

701
00:49:57.207 --> 00:49:58.398
- How about you
answer some of them?


702
00:49:58.442 --> 00:50:00.199
- Yeah Princess, I'm not
fucking like, I'm not-


703
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:28.938
- You, on the floor.

704
00:50:30.173 --> 00:50:31.509
Show me your hands.

705
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:35.245
Show me your hands!

706
00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:40.484
Show me your hands!

707
00:50:48.692 --> 00:50:52.452
Get up, put that down.

708
00:50:52.496 --> 00:50:56.099
Put that object down.
Drop it, drop it.


709
00:50:57.066 --> 00:50:58.324
Stand up.

710
00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:00.303
Stand.

711
00:51:06.276 --> 00:51:08.311
Slowly, walk this way.

712
00:51:15.653 --> 00:51:16.654
Right, who are you?

713
00:51:18.221 --> 00:51:19.011
Who are you?

714
00:51:19.055 --> 00:51:19.945
- I'm a medical worker.

715
00:51:19.989 --> 00:51:21.213
- All right. This way, please.

716
00:51:21.257 --> 00:51:22.560
This way, please.
This way, please.


717
00:51:23.494 --> 00:51:24.984
This way, please
sit on my chair.


718
00:51:25.028 --> 00:51:27.821
Sit on the chair, please.
Sit on the chair, please.


719
00:51:27.865 --> 00:51:29.667
Okay, now.

720
00:51:30.601 --> 00:51:31.936
Where are the others?

721
00:51:33.471 --> 00:51:34.528
- Dead.

722
00:51:34.572 --> 00:51:35.695
- Dead. How?
- Dead?


723
00:51:35.739 --> 00:51:36.929
- I don't know.

724
00:51:36.973 --> 00:51:38.130
- What do you mean
you don't know?


725
00:51:38.174 --> 00:51:39.433
Did you see them?
Did you see them die?


726
00:51:39.477 --> 00:51:40.667
- Yes.
- Right.


727
00:51:40.711 --> 00:51:42.201
Was it those fucking
weird people out there


728
00:51:42.245 --> 00:51:43.380
that got them?

729
00:51:44.548 --> 00:51:45.348
Right.

730
00:51:46.917 --> 00:51:48.385
- Please put the gun down.

731
00:51:49.954 --> 00:51:51.944
- No, nevermind the fucking gun.

732
00:51:51.988 --> 00:51:53.145
- All right,

733
00:51:53.189 --> 00:51:54.113
just drop the gun.
- I'm a medical worker.


734
00:51:54.157 --> 00:51:55.515
I'm a medical worker, all right?

735
00:51:55.559 --> 00:51:56.783
- Yes, yes.

736
00:51:56.827 --> 00:51:57.751
I'm a medical worker.
I don't hurt people.


737
00:51:57.795 --> 00:51:59.352
All right? I don't hurt people.

738
00:51:59.396 --> 00:52:00.587
- Right so, how are
they gonna get you out?


739
00:52:00.631 --> 00:52:01.822
How are they getting you out?

740
00:52:01.866 --> 00:52:02.856
- You're getting
me out, aren't you?


741
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.357
- Oh, fucking hell.

742
00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:05.492
We can't get you out, we
haven't got a fucking way


743
00:52:05.536 --> 00:52:06.760
to get out of here!

744
00:52:06.804 --> 00:52:07.828
How are they getting you-

745
00:52:07.872 --> 00:52:09.094
What have they told you?

746
00:52:09.138 --> 00:52:09.896
- Well how did you
get in here then?


747
00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.163
You're gonna get me out.

748
00:52:11.207 --> 00:52:12.666
- Were you in the
fucking briefing?


749
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:15.946
- Calm down, sir. He's one
of us, he's on our side.


750
00:52:17.313 --> 00:52:18.738
- But you're gonna get
me out of here, right?


751
00:52:18.782 --> 00:52:20.039
- Yes.

752
00:52:20.083 --> 00:52:20.973
We'll do that.
- Okay, so that's your job.


753
00:52:21.017 --> 00:52:21.775
You're gonna get me out of here.

754
00:52:21.819 --> 00:52:22.709
- Yes, yes yes...

755
00:52:22.753 --> 00:52:23.510
- Well then get me out of here.

756
00:52:23.554 --> 00:52:24.310
- Yes, now shut up.

757
00:52:27.323 --> 00:52:29.158
- What's wrong with him?

758
00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.196
- Now, who are you?

759
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.342
- I'm not telling you.

760
00:53:57.047 --> 00:53:58.471
- The infected.

761
00:53:58.515 --> 00:54:00.473
Why the fuck is everyone running
around infected out there?


762
00:54:00.517 --> 00:54:02.274
Tell me. Tell me now.

763
00:54:02.318 --> 00:54:03.376
- All right!

764
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.711
All right.

765
00:54:04.755 --> 00:54:05.679
The parasite.

766
00:54:05.723 --> 00:54:08.481
I don't think it's in the meat.

767
00:54:08.525 --> 00:54:10.461
I think it's in the
vaccine, all right?


768
00:54:11.495 --> 00:54:13.687
- Chris! Get back.

769
00:54:13.731 --> 00:54:15.422
I didn't fucking tell
you to interrogate him.


770
00:54:15.466 --> 00:54:16.967
Get back in the fucking chair.

771
00:54:19.036 --> 00:54:19.870
Stay there.

772
00:54:21.137 --> 00:54:22.039
All right, what's going on?

773
00:54:23.206 --> 00:54:24.531
- Mate. You've
gotta answer now, mate.


774
00:54:24.575 --> 00:54:27.067
What's what, what, what
parasite, what vaccine?


775
00:54:27.111 --> 00:54:29.936
- Look, look, it's population
control. All right?


776
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:31.571
They're testing it out
on a small population


777
00:54:31.615 --> 00:54:35.809
to see if it would be effective
on the wider population.


778
00:54:35.853 --> 00:54:37.811
If they do that, they can
cut down the population.


779
00:54:37.855 --> 00:54:38.945
This is what this is.

780
00:54:38.989 --> 00:54:40.312
This is a test.
- Are you part of that?


781
00:54:40.356 --> 00:54:41.648
- I'm just a medical
worker, mate.


782
00:54:41.692 --> 00:54:42.726
I'm a medical worker.

783
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:48.488
- Cover your fucking
mouth when you cough!


784
00:54:48.532 --> 00:54:49.733
- He's infected sir!

785
00:54:51.935 --> 00:54:53.893
- Stay fucking down you bastard!

786
00:54:56.073 --> 00:54:57.340
Back back back!

787
00:55:03.447 --> 00:55:06.271
- Look just put a
bullet through his brain!


788
00:55:06.315 --> 00:55:08.942
- Wait. I need to
tell you something.


789
00:55:08.986 --> 00:55:10.110
I need to tell you something.

790
00:55:10.154 --> 00:55:11.378
- Right, if he coughs...

791
00:55:11.422 --> 00:55:13.546
- Listen, listen to
me, just listen to me.


792
00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:15.448
All right? Okay, the parasites.

793
00:55:15.492 --> 00:55:17.450
They're not in the
fucking insects, right?


794
00:55:17.494 --> 00:55:18.952
They're in the vaccines.

795
00:55:18.996 --> 00:55:20.620
I'm sure they're in the bloody
vaccines. I injected myself.


796
00:55:20.664 --> 00:55:22.287
I didn't get bitten by
anything. All right?


797
00:55:22.331 --> 00:55:24.557
I have protective clothing
on, they didn't bite me.


798
00:55:24.601 --> 00:55:28.906
The-

799
00:55:32.409 --> 00:55:33.744
The parasites...

800
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:46.790
- Stay down.

801
00:56:04.775 --> 00:56:09.780
Stay down! Stay down!

802
00:56:11.715 --> 00:56:14.474
- Put something on
him guys, just get him!


803
00:56:16.053 --> 00:56:16.887
Princess!

804
00:56:19.623 --> 00:56:20.457
- Chris!

805
00:56:24.595 --> 00:56:26.186
Help me out!

806
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:27.020
- Just get me out of here!

807
00:56:27.064 --> 00:56:28.220
- Don't fucking move!

808
00:56:28.264 --> 00:56:29.789
- Get me out of here!
Just take me away!


809
00:56:29.833 --> 00:56:31.524
- Don't fucking move!

810
00:56:31.568 --> 00:56:33.137
Fucking stay there.

811
00:57:02.065 --> 00:57:05.334
- Right, take this
fucker over there


812
00:57:06.703 --> 00:57:07.538
and cuff him to the radiator.

813
00:57:14.778 --> 00:57:15.612
- Sit up!

814
00:57:28.559 --> 00:57:29.449
- Need to ask him
some more questions.


815
00:57:29.493 --> 00:57:31.184
He said about a population...

816
00:57:31.228 --> 00:57:33.253
Cutting the populations
in a, in a tight community


817
00:57:33.297 --> 00:57:35.999
to see if it'd spread out into
the wider, into the wider...


818
00:57:46.176 --> 00:57:48.868
You say you're not to blame,

819
00:57:48.912 --> 00:57:51.315
but the vaccines must
have been supplied by you.


820
00:57:55.385 --> 00:57:57.377
We thought we were

821
00:57:57.421 --> 00:58:01.447
protecting the meat workers
and the medical workers...


822
00:58:01.491 --> 00:58:02.659
We had no idea.

823
00:58:04.695 --> 00:58:08.988
And the suppliers were
all companies abroad,


824
00:58:09.032 --> 00:58:10.567
we never tested them ourselves.

825
00:58:16.206 --> 00:58:19.432
- The film mentions
population reduction.


826
00:58:19.476 --> 00:58:21.768
Do you think it's a good idea?

827
00:58:21.812 --> 00:58:24.314
- That's, that's an
important question.


828
00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:28.018
It was something we had
to do something about.


829
00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:34.391
Part of our times...

830
00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:37.861
- Who are you then?

831
00:58:39.229 --> 00:58:43.033
- Some of us thought,
maybe, that we had a future.


832
00:58:43.967 --> 00:58:47.560
But now I've lost everything.

833
00:58:47.604 --> 00:58:49.172
And there is no future.

834
00:58:58.715 --> 00:58:59.549
- Oh, god...

835
00:59:02.319 --> 00:59:04.321
I wanna get out of here.

836
00:59:29.913 --> 00:59:30.747
- What?

837
00:59:31.715 --> 00:59:32.916
- What we gonna do?

838
00:59:35.652 --> 00:59:37.110
- That's up to him, isn't it?

839
00:59:37.154 --> 00:59:38.411
He's the one in charge.

840
00:59:38.455 --> 00:59:40.580
Radio... Radio's not working.

841
00:59:40.624 --> 00:59:41.558
- Princess?

842
00:59:45.929 --> 00:59:47.120
Jesus...

843
00:59:47.164 --> 00:59:48.865
Princess, you, you
all right mate?


844
00:59:51.935 --> 00:59:53.360
Listen.

845
00:59:53.404 --> 00:59:55.872
I'm sorry. I don't, I
don't, I don't know how...


846
00:59:59.609 --> 01:00:00.811
I'm sorry, man.

847
01:00:03.914 --> 01:00:06.316
Yeah, I'll, I'll
leave you to it.


848
01:00:11.054 --> 01:00:11.888
Jo.

849
01:00:19.629 --> 01:00:20.465
Jo.

850
01:00:22.499 --> 01:00:24.290
Look at me. Okay?

851
01:00:24.334 --> 01:00:26.859
I'm gonna get us out
of here, alright?


852
01:00:26.903 --> 01:00:29.407
I've got a plan and
you just need to,


853
01:00:31.141 --> 01:00:32.832
you need to stay calm.

854
01:00:32.876 --> 01:00:34.033
You need to stay collected.

855
01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.435
- Hold your fire.

856
01:00:58.835 --> 01:00:59.993
- What the hell.

857
01:01:00.037 --> 01:01:01.594
Let's go!

858
01:01:01.638 --> 01:01:03.129
- Shut up, Kyle! Shut up!

859
01:01:03.173 --> 01:01:05.131
- We've got legs,
let's use them!


860
01:01:21.591 --> 01:01:23.916
- Oh God. We gotta leave.

861
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.163
Princess. Pretty boy.

862
01:01:28.732 --> 01:01:30.323
Let's get out of here.

863
01:01:30.367 --> 01:01:32.592
- Sir, we need to go!

864
01:01:32.636 --> 01:01:33.427
- Let's get out of here!

865
01:01:33.471 --> 01:01:34.439
- Sir what do we do?

866
01:01:36.441 --> 01:01:38.197
- Come on, your
training leads up to now!


867
01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:39.410
What do we do?

868
01:01:40.445 --> 01:01:41.512
- Go, lets go!

869
01:01:45.949 --> 01:01:48.585
- 'Cause whatever's
out there, it's coming in.


870
01:01:52.222 --> 01:01:53.613
This is what I'd do.

871
01:01:53.657 --> 01:01:55.092
Keep yourself safe, sit down.

872
01:02:06.236 --> 01:02:07.560
- We're surrounded, yeah.

873
01:02:07.604 --> 01:02:08.805
- Just calm down.

874
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.432
- This isn't what I'd do.

875
01:02:11.476 --> 01:02:12.665
This isn't who I am.
- Kyle, calm down!


876
01:02:12.709 --> 01:02:13.810
- This is who you are!

877
01:02:15.011 --> 01:02:16.769
- Be cool.

878
01:02:16.813 --> 01:02:17.603
Just stay calm.

879
01:02:17.647 --> 01:02:18.805
- How do guys do it?

880
01:02:18.849 --> 01:02:20.407
- Kyle! They can
hear you, probably.


881
01:02:20.451 --> 01:02:21.941
- What do you mean,
they're already outside!


882
01:02:21.985 --> 01:02:22.875
- Yeah, well don't-

883
01:02:22.919 --> 01:02:24.010
- They know we're in here!

884
01:02:24.054 --> 01:02:25.711
I could yell, top of my voice,

885
01:02:25.755 --> 01:02:27.657
Come and get me you fucks!
- Kyle!


886
01:02:30.894 --> 01:02:31.928
- Makes no odds.

887
01:02:33.063 --> 01:02:34.187
This is mental.

888
01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:35.922
- This is too much, Kyle.

889
01:02:35.966 --> 01:02:37.156
- Just waiting here.

890
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.358
- I just wanna go home now.

891
01:02:38.402 --> 01:02:39.803
- Really? Really,
really waiting to die?


892
01:02:41.472 --> 01:02:42.305
So?

893
01:02:47.644 --> 01:02:49.713
What the fuck.

894
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.050
Fuck...

895
01:03:10.066 --> 01:03:12.359
How much longer
do you need? Huh?


896
01:03:12.403 --> 01:03:14.260
You ask 10 seconds to
make the snap decisions,


897
01:03:14.304 --> 01:03:16.929
but it's been, I don't know,
like two minutes since then.


898
01:03:16.973 --> 01:03:20.066
How much longer do you need?
Do you need half an hour?


899
01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:21.401
Do you need an hour to
make that snap decision?


900
01:03:21.445 --> 01:03:23.046
- Shut the fuck up!

901
01:03:38.862 --> 01:03:40.864
- Jo? Jo!

902
01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.925
- Right. Cover the
fucking windows. Cover
the fucking doors.


903
01:03:45.969 --> 01:03:47.427
I'm going to get her.

904
01:03:47.471 --> 01:03:48.738
You! Stay here.

905
01:03:53.411 --> 01:03:55.201
- So
those people in the woods,


906
01:03:55.245 --> 01:03:56.614
what was going on?

907
01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:01.140
The pathogen mutated in them,

908
01:04:01.184 --> 01:04:02.819
changed their DNA.

909
01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.189
The blood flow to the brain.

910
01:04:08.325 --> 01:04:10.193
Everything was in flux.

911
01:04:13.497 --> 01:04:14.498
I was there.

912
01:04:19.236 --> 01:04:20.370
I was there.

913
01:04:23.541 --> 01:04:25.632
They're coming for us.

914
01:04:25.676 --> 01:04:30.437
- Who are? The mutants
or the government?


915
01:04:30.481 --> 01:04:34.084
- Doesn't matter who
is coming for us,


916
01:04:35.653 --> 01:04:37.743
but they will come.

917
01:04:37.787 --> 01:04:42.792
And they want a world
more stable and organized.


918
01:04:43.661 --> 01:04:44.361
- Do you agree with that?

919
01:04:45.563 --> 01:04:46.796
- I'm not sure I'll
be around for that.


920
01:05:57.435 --> 01:05:59.470
- Don't move. Don't move!

921
01:07:02.298 --> 01:07:03.701
- I don't know...

922
01:07:21.084 --> 01:07:22.318
What was that?

923
01:07:37.835 --> 01:07:39.670
- Sounds like they're
coming down the stairs.


924
01:07:42.172 --> 01:07:43.607
I've got nowhere to go.

925
01:09:20.704 --> 01:09:21.705
Where am I?

926
01:09:35.419 --> 01:09:36.252
Oh my god.

927
01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:40.824
Where even am I?

928
01:09:43.894 --> 01:09:45.061
Oh my god.

929
01:09:51.769 --> 01:09:53.693
Where is this place?

930
01:09:53.737 --> 01:09:55.539
I can't stay here.

931
01:10:18.562 --> 01:10:19.920
Jesus...

932
01:10:19.964 --> 01:10:22.633
- What's wrong with you?
- Jo...


933
01:10:23.701 --> 01:10:25.057
- Where have you been?

934
01:10:25.101 --> 01:10:26.091
- I don't know...

935
01:10:26.135 --> 01:10:27.471
We got split up.

936
01:10:28.706 --> 01:10:29.896
- Where is everyone?

937
01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:30.841
- I don't know, Jo!

938
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:33.510
It's all gone to shit out there.

939
01:10:34.445 --> 01:10:35.613
- Kyle, I'm scared.

940
01:10:37.014 --> 01:10:39.039
- Yeah, yeah. I know...

941
01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:41.508
Just keep in.

942
01:10:41.552 --> 01:10:43.309
How long have you been here?

943
01:10:43.353 --> 01:10:45.879
- I don't know, a while.

944
01:10:45.923 --> 01:10:49.816
- Good. Well, well,
we'll keep in here.


945
01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.351
Keep it calm.

946
01:10:51.395 --> 01:10:52.195
- Oh God.

947
01:10:54.130 --> 01:10:55.689
What's happening?

948
01:10:55.733 --> 01:10:56.533
- No idea.

949
01:10:57.735 --> 01:10:59.392
- I don't get, I don't
get what's going on.


950
01:10:59.436 --> 01:11:04.207
- Jo, please. None of
us know what's going on.


951
01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:06.800
- Where are the others?

952
01:11:06.844 --> 01:11:08.001
- Gone!

953
01:11:08.045 --> 01:11:09.970
Gonna have to relax.

954
01:11:10.014 --> 01:11:11.972
That's all we can do now.
- I can't relax.


955
01:11:12.016 --> 01:11:12.973
- Just relax.
- Relax?


956
01:11:13.017 --> 01:11:13.840
- Keep it down.
- You're joking?


957
01:11:13.884 --> 01:11:14.685
Relax?

958
01:11:16.086 --> 01:11:17.444
I'm not relaxing.

959
01:11:17.488 --> 01:11:19.512
Not when there's
something out there.


960
01:11:19.556 --> 01:11:20.714
You've seen people
we've seen them dead!


961
01:11:20.758 --> 01:11:23.292
- Jo! Listen to me, okay?

962
01:11:24.461 --> 01:11:26.620
We're gonna get out of
it. We're gonna be fine.


963
01:11:26.664 --> 01:11:29.055
But the louder you make,
the more noise you make,


964
01:11:29.099 --> 01:11:31.992
the more chance that someone
out there is gonna find out.


965
01:11:32.036 --> 01:11:33.460
And if it's infested
in the woods


966
01:11:33.504 --> 01:11:36.328
with whatever the hell
those fucking things are,


967
01:11:36.372 --> 01:11:38.297
you and me need to keep it down.

968
01:11:38.341 --> 01:11:40.477
Keep it quiet, and
keep it together.


969
01:11:41.412 --> 01:11:43.279
- Okay. Okay.

970
01:11:46.116 --> 01:11:47.239
You're okay?

971
01:11:47.283 --> 01:11:48.642
- Yeah.

972
01:11:48.686 --> 01:11:52.445
Just get this camera down.

973
01:11:52.489 --> 01:11:54.581
- Okay.

974
01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:55.426
Okay.

975
01:11:59.063 --> 01:11:59.830
Watch out.

976
01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:07.827
- Can't hear a thing.

977
01:12:07.871 --> 01:12:08.928
- Good.

978
01:12:08.972 --> 01:12:10.273
As long as there's...

979
01:12:11.141 --> 01:12:12.297
Is everything okay?

980
01:12:12.341 --> 01:12:13.177
- Shh.

981
01:12:20.984 --> 01:12:22.853
- Kyle! Kyle!

982
01:12:25.254 --> 01:12:28.515
Kyle. Kyle?

983
01:12:28.559 --> 01:12:30.884
Kyle what's out
there? Come back!


984
01:12:30.928 --> 01:12:31.762
Kyle!

985
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:35.555
The virus is in the vaccine,

986
01:12:35.599 --> 01:12:37.123
It wasn't in the meat?

987
01:12:37.167 --> 01:12:38.323
It's hard to believe

988
01:12:38.367 --> 01:12:40.269
that our government
would experiment on us,


989
01:12:42.139 --> 01:12:43.339
but really we should.

990
01:12:45.008 --> 01:12:47.767
The German nation found
it hard to believe


991
01:12:47.811 --> 01:12:52.204
that their government
would test and experiment


992
01:12:52.248 --> 01:12:53.973
on its own people.

993
01:12:54.017 --> 01:12:56.543
The greatest number of
murders in the world have been


994
01:12:56.587 --> 01:12:59.179
carried out by governments.

995
01:12:59.223 --> 01:13:00.724
And, and you know what gets me?

996
01:13:02.226 --> 01:13:04.417
As a prime minister
or president,


997
01:13:04.461 --> 01:13:06.997
you are more likely to reelected

998
01:13:08.031 --> 01:13:09.133
if you start a war.

999
01:13:24.481 --> 01:13:25.516
- I dunno where I am.

1000
01:13:28.218 --> 01:13:29.052
I'm on my own.

1001
01:13:30.454 --> 01:13:32.277
Kyle, the film,
the guys have gone,


1002
01:13:32.321 --> 01:13:36.983
and they're, they're
nowhere to be found.


1003
01:13:37.027 --> 01:13:39.830
And I don't know what to do.

1004
01:13:42.566 --> 01:13:47.427
I'm hearing things. And
there's something out there.


1005
01:13:47.471 --> 01:13:51.542
And I dunno whether to
stay here or find the guys.


1006
01:13:52.609 --> 01:13:56.569
And I just don't
know what to do.


1007
01:13:56.613 --> 01:13:59.483
I just don't know
how to find them.


1008
01:14:13.730 --> 01:14:14.565
Oh jeez.

1009
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.892
What has caused them to go mad?

1010
01:14:18.936 --> 01:14:19.793
Is it the vaccines?

1011
01:14:19.837 --> 01:14:20.838
- Who told you that?

1012
01:14:21.738 --> 01:14:22.873
- The medical worker.

1013
01:14:24.308 --> 01:14:28.201
- We were to infect
the small community


1014
01:14:28.245 --> 01:14:30.637
and see what would happen,

1015
01:14:30.681 --> 01:14:33.317
how a tactical police
unit would cope.


1016
01:14:34.952 --> 01:14:37.020
And if it could be contained.

1017
01:14:37.955 --> 01:14:39.379
- This is mass murder.

1018
01:14:39.423 --> 01:14:42.215
- Don't you get it you
stupid little girl?


1019
01:14:42.259 --> 01:14:46.119
Population has to come down.

1020
01:14:46.163 --> 01:14:48.232
Population control
has to happen.


1021
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.501
There's no choice.

1022
01:14:52.936 --> 01:14:54.127
- Right.

1023
01:14:54.171 --> 01:14:56.162
Is there any way I
can get out of this?


1024
01:14:56.206 --> 01:14:57.441
Please. Please.

1025
01:14:58.976 --> 01:15:01.367
- If you make it to
the edge of the forest.


1026
01:15:01.411 --> 01:15:03.146
There might be a way.

1027
01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:09.653
- Please get me out of here.

1028
01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:44.948
- Jo!

1029
01:16:45.916 --> 01:16:46.750
- Kyle!

1030
01:16:54.024 --> 01:16:54.858
Kyle!

1031
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.420
- No one's getting
out of here, Jo.


1032
01:16:59.464 --> 01:17:02.555
We're all as good
as good as dead.


1033
01:17:02.599 --> 01:17:05.124
- What happened to that person?

1034
01:17:05.168 --> 01:17:06.059
You didn't kill them, did you?

1035
01:17:06.103 --> 01:17:07.504
- Everyone has to die, Jo.

1036
01:17:08.572 --> 01:17:10.263
- I'm scared, Kyle.

1037
01:17:10.307 --> 01:17:12.477
They're trying to kill me.

1038
01:17:14.611 --> 01:17:15.779
- Don't worry.

1039
01:17:17.047 --> 01:17:19.105
I'll kill you myself.

1040
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:21.307
- You're infected aren't you?

1041
01:17:21.351 --> 01:17:22.343
Please Kyle, fight it.

1042
01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:25.122
- All I want is one taste.

1043
01:17:26.823 --> 01:17:28.625
I just wanna taste...

1044
01:17:29.693 --> 01:17:31.452
I just wanna bite off your neck!

1045
01:17:31.496 --> 01:17:32.386
- Please, Kyle no!

1046
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:33.853
- I just want a taste Jo!

1047
01:17:35.466 --> 01:17:38.825
- I just want to
bite your lips off.


1048
01:17:38.869 --> 01:17:40.526
- No!
- I just want a taste-


1049
01:17:42.906 --> 01:17:45.399
- Chris, what did you...

1050
01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:46.532
- We need to get out of here.

1051
01:17:46.576 --> 01:17:48.167
Just stay by my side, okay?

1052
01:17:48.211 --> 01:17:49.268
- Where are the others?

1053
01:17:49.312 --> 01:17:50.937
- They're dead.

1054
01:17:50.981 --> 01:17:54.273
Those bastards out there ripped
my whole damn team apart.


1055
01:17:54.317 --> 01:17:56.843
Plus our Sergeant
was a fuckin' idiot.


1056
01:17:56.887 --> 01:17:58.711
- We're not going
to make it, are we?


1057
01:17:58.755 --> 01:18:00.347
- Those things out there,
they're not zombies!


1058
01:18:00.391 --> 01:18:01.581
They're not the living dead,

1059
01:18:01.625 --> 01:18:03.149
they're just crazy
infected people.


1060
01:18:03.193 --> 01:18:04.385
But they die, Jo.

1061
01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:06.886
They die just like
everybody else.


1062
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:07.954
- Have you got a gun?

1063
01:18:07.998 --> 01:18:09.490
- No, but they sure as hell

1064
01:18:09.534 --> 01:18:12.225
don't like this fucking baton
wrapped around their heads.


1065
01:18:12.269 --> 01:18:14.237
- So they, they set us up?

1066
01:18:15.672 --> 01:18:17.797
It was in the vaccines that
were given to everyone.


1067
01:18:17.841 --> 01:18:20.501
- It's all about wiping people
out with this infection.


1068
01:18:20.545 --> 01:18:21.601
- Shit.

1069
01:18:21.645 --> 01:18:22.802
What do we do now?

1070
01:18:22.846 --> 01:18:24.170
- Look, Jo, we're gonna
get out this, okay?


1071
01:18:24.214 --> 01:18:25.671
- Chris!
Stay close to me.


1072
01:18:25.715 --> 01:18:27.907
- Kyle!

1073
01:18:27.951 --> 01:18:28.841
- Jo!

1074
01:18:28.885 --> 01:18:30.076
Jo, when you get the chance,

1075
01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.321
just get the hell
out of here and run!


1076
01:18:32.322 --> 01:18:33.480
Come on then Kyle.

1077
01:18:33.524 --> 01:18:35.815
I've been waiting a
long damn time for this.


1078
01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:45.202
Not so mouthy now are ya?

1079
01:18:47.370 --> 01:18:50.730
- Chris. Chris we need
to get out of here, now.


1080
01:18:50.774 --> 01:18:52.098
Chris!

1081
01:18:52.142 --> 01:18:53.578
Oh Jesus!

1082
01:19:00.117 --> 01:19:01.307
- Jo!

1083
01:19:01.351 --> 01:19:02.241
Jo get the hell
out of here! Run!


1084
01:19:02.285 --> 01:19:03.109
Jo run!

1085
01:19:03.153 --> 01:19:04.677
Come on you fuckers!

1086
01:19:04.721 --> 01:19:06.879
I'm gonna take each and
every damn one of you out!


1087
01:19:06.923 --> 01:19:08.549
Come on!
- Chris!


1088
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:15.621
- No! Chris!

1089
01:19:15.665 --> 01:19:16.501
Chris!

1090
01:19:30.448 --> 01:19:31.270
- You been infected?

1091
01:19:31.314 --> 01:19:32.439
- No.

1092
01:19:32.483 --> 01:19:33.940
- Right, stay
close. Come with us.


1093
01:19:33.984 --> 01:19:35.752
Pete, cover the rear.

1094
01:19:43.461 --> 01:19:44.083
- Keep up.

1095
01:19:44.127 --> 01:19:44.828
- I'm trying.

1096
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:48.489
- We've got a vehicle.

1097
01:19:48.533 --> 01:19:49.366
You're safe now.

1098
01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:51.525
What's your name?

1099
01:19:51.569 --> 01:19:52.359
- I'm Jo.

1100
01:19:52.403 --> 01:19:53.259
- I'm John.

1101
01:19:53.303 --> 01:19:54.861
- What's happening?

1102
01:19:54.905 --> 01:19:56.129
- I've come here to
take you to safety.


1103
01:19:56.173 --> 01:19:57.364
- Sir.

1104
01:19:57.408 --> 01:19:58.164
Sir, halfway clear
to the Jeep sir.


1105
01:19:58.208 --> 01:19:58.965
- Good.

1106
01:19:59.009 --> 01:20:00.199
Let's make a move.

1107
01:20:00.243 --> 01:20:01.767
- Where are the
others? Are they-


1108
01:20:16.059 --> 01:20:18.728
- Go, in the Jeep now.

1109
01:20:20.964 --> 01:20:22.155
- Where are we going?

1110
01:20:22.199 --> 01:20:24.491
- I'm driving you to
the evacuation center.


1111
01:20:24.535 --> 01:20:25.536
You're safe now.

1112
01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:48.314
- Look. It's okay, it's okay.

1113
01:20:48.358 --> 01:20:51.150
This compound here is to
evacuate everyone not infected.


1114
01:20:51.194 --> 01:20:53.387
Everyone has to go
through infection control.


1115
01:20:53.431 --> 01:20:56.456
It's very simple, you
just receive an injection.


1116
01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:57.890
- What sort of injection?

1117
01:20:57.934 --> 01:20:59.393
- It's just a vaccine.

1118
01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:00.326
- No, no no.

1119
01:21:00.370 --> 01:21:01.361
- Nothing to worry about.

1120
01:21:01.405 --> 01:21:02.295
Calm down.
- You don't understand.


1121
01:21:02.339 --> 01:21:03.564
- No, no! It's in the vaccine!

1122
01:21:03.608 --> 01:21:05.164
- Okay guys, look, can
you come over please?


1123
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.232
- No! It's in the vaccine!

1124
01:21:06.276 --> 01:21:08.334
- I need a
vaccination here, now!


1125
01:21:10.715 --> 01:21:12.683
- No! No!

1126
01:21:14.719 --> 01:21:19.022
No!

1127
01:21:27.097 --> 01:21:28.187
- Okay. That's it.

1128
01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:29.656
We're locking it down now.

1129
01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:30.957
It's time to leave.

1130
01:21:31.001 --> 01:21:31.835
Dr. Fisher?

1131
01:21:33.303 --> 01:21:34.104
It's all clear.

1132
01:21:37.675 --> 01:21:39.042
Let's get to the transport.

1133
01:21:46.016 --> 01:21:47.418
- This is Dr. Fisher.

1134
01:21:48.619 --> 01:21:50.910
That is the last
of the survivors.


1135
01:21:50.954 --> 01:21:52.956
You can close the perimeter.

1136
01:26:33.336 --> 01:26:37.129
We've been here too long.

1137
01:26:37.173 --> 01:26:38.341
We have to go.

1138
01:26:39.777 --> 01:26:41.244
There's nowhere to hide.

1139
01:26:42.178 --> 01:26:43.269
- I'm just like you.

1140
01:26:43.313 --> 01:26:44.882
Fooled as you were.

1141
01:26:46.016 --> 01:26:50.054
Doctors, nurses.
We were all fooled.


1142
01:26:51.488 --> 01:26:55.247
- And the girl from the camera
crew, what happened to her?


1143
01:26:55.291 --> 01:27:00.129
- She came to us and we
processed her like anyone else.


1144
01:27:05.134 --> 01:27:08.772
We tried our best
to keep her safe.


1145
01:27:11.842 --> 01:27:13.343
- And the vaccine?

1146
01:27:18.749 --> 01:27:22.086
- No-one realized the
virus was in the vaccine.


1147
01:27:24.421 --> 01:27:28.425
When she turned, we were
told it was still the virus.


1148
01:27:29.325 --> 01:27:31.428
That the vaccine was safe.

1149
01:27:33.564 --> 01:27:36.356
It didn't take long
for us to realize


1150
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.370
that the viral strain in
the vaccine was mutating.


1151
01:27:42.039 --> 01:27:45.743
It became very contagious
and aggressive.


1152
01:27:47.711 --> 01:27:49.212
That's when the world changed.

1153
01:27:50.414 --> 01:27:52.973
- And what do you think
the reason for this was?


1154
01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:56.053
Some end game? Or
just a mistake?


1155
01:27:58.555 --> 01:28:00.279
Do you believe it's depopulation

1156
01:28:00.323 --> 01:28:01.959
as mentioned in
the film footage?


1157
01:28:03.861 --> 01:28:06.295
- I believe in depopulation.

1158
01:28:07.698 --> 01:28:11.091
It's been in the minds
of governments, scholars,


1159
01:28:11.135 --> 01:28:12.970
and sages for many years.

1160
01:28:13.971 --> 01:28:15.472
I agree with it.

1161
01:28:16.674 --> 01:28:17.675
But not in this way.

1162
01:28:19.009 --> 01:28:20.700
I'm not to blame.

1163
01:28:20.744 --> 01:28:22.746
I didn't trick anyone.

1164
01:28:24.648 --> 01:28:28.619
But now, they want
someone to lynch.


1165
01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:34.591
I'm in the front line,
but none of it's my fault.


1166
01:28:38.996 --> 01:28:41.330
- What do you think
is next for us?


1167
01:28:43.199 --> 01:28:45.469
- I've taken the
experimental vaccine.


1168
01:28:46.737 --> 01:28:48.872
So there is no future for me.

1169
01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:54.343
But for you, future is this.

1170
01:28:55.244 --> 01:28:58.281
Hunger, power cuts,

1171
01:28:59.450 --> 01:29:03.710
all kinds of contagious,
aggressive mutations,


1172
01:29:03.754 --> 01:29:07.681
like a cancer spreading
around the world.


1173
01:29:07.725 --> 01:29:09.426
A living hell.

1174
01:29:11.428 --> 01:29:13.318
I have to go now.

1175
01:29:13.362 --> 01:29:15.833
- But there's still more
questions to be asked.


1176
01:29:16.967 --> 01:29:19.770
- I think the time
for questions is over.


1177
01:29:21.205 --> 01:29:23.006
It's up to you now.

1178
01:29:24.373 --> 01:29:27.100
- Please, give us
one last answer.


1179
01:29:27.144 --> 01:29:28.812
What should we take from this?

1180
01:29:31.815 --> 01:29:33.940
- They're coming for us.

1181
01:29:33.984 --> 01:29:36.342
They're coming for all of us.

1182
01:29:36.386 --> 01:29:40.312
Save yourself. Don't
listen to anything.


1183
01:29:40.356 --> 01:29:42.314
You've been warned.

1184
01:30:10.988 --> 01:30:12.756
Things have changed.

1185
01:30:18.128 --> 01:30:19.530
There's nowhere to hide.

1186
01:30:29.907 --> 01:30:32.098
You have to come
to terms with it,


1187
01:30:32.142 --> 01:30:34.711
as everyone has joined
up with the program.


1188
01:30:45.789 --> 01:30:50.260
Do I stand out and resist,
or go along with it?


1189
01:30:59.837 --> 01:31:01.872
How much more of
this can we take?


1190
01:31:04.675 --> 01:31:05.976
Is resistance futile?

1191
01:31:17.721 --> 01:31:20.757
Is life still worth living?
