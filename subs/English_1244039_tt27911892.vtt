Did she get out?

00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:09.756
Well,

- [Wilber] Huh?

65
00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:54.006

86
00:10:15.754 --> 00:10:17.490

- Shut


87

up.

88
00:10:23.094 --> 00:10:24.430
What did he want?

89
00:10:24.463 --> 00:10:25.965
- He was just
making conversation.


90
00:10:26.765 --> 00:10:28.634
- Making conversation?

91
00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:29.435
- Yeah.

92
00:10:29.468 --> 00:10:30.569
He's a cop.

93
00:10:30.602 --> 00:10:31.904
They talk to everybody.

Brian, let's go.

96
00:10:39.344 --> 00:10:40.378

say

98
00:10:42.014 --> 00:10:42.948
my name.

99

(engine rumbling)

101
00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:04.270

102
00:11:05.003 --> 00:11:06.038
exactly?

103
00:11:07.472 --> 00:11:10.543
- He asked how we were doing
today and where we were from.


104
00:11:11.443 --> 00:11:12.645
- And where we're headed.

105
00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:15.681
- [Brian] And what did you say?

106
00:11:15.714 --> 00:11:17.449
- [Josh] Spencerville.

107
00:11:17.482 --> 00:11:18.917
- [Brian] Where's that?

108
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.453
- [Josh] It's a couple
miles down the road.


109
00:11:21.486 --> 00:11:23.155
- [Brian] How do you know that?

110
00:11:24.156 --> 00:11:26.458
- There are road signs.

111
00:11:31.096 --> 00:11:33.799
(uneasy music)

112
00:11:46.044 --> 00:11:48.180
- Where are we headed anyways?

113
00:11:48.213 --> 00:11:50.449
- You'll know when we get there.

114
00:11:50.482 --> 00:11:52.484
- Being pretty extreme, dude.

115
00:11:52.517 --> 00:11:54.786
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

116
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.289
And everybody just needs
to stop asking me that


117
00:11:57.322 --> 00:11:59.391
and shut the fuck up.

118
00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:01.393
Especially you,

119
00:12:03.562 --> 00:12:04.864
little pecker head.

120

You know, what the fuck
is your fucking problem?


122
00:12:10.836 --> 00:12:11.836
- You

123
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.706
almost fucked this all up!

124
00:12:15.574 --> 00:12:17.876
You're lucky we're
not in jail right now.


125
00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:19.378
It's just been too convenient

126
00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:21.212
those cops showed
up when they did.


127
00:12:21.246 --> 00:12:23.682
- And what the fuck is
that supposed to mean?


128
00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:25.350
You think I called them?

129
00:12:25.384 --> 00:12:26.752
- Of all the moments

130
00:12:26.785 --> 00:12:29.054
in all the places
for cops to be,


131
00:12:29.087 --> 00:12:31.557
they happened to be right there?

132
00:12:33.592 --> 00:12:34.859

135
00:12:37.729 --> 00:12:41.666

Everybody ready?

Okay, pull.

172
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.722
- Tell me where we were
going and then I'll do it.


173
00:15:19.758 --> 00:15:20.558
- Fuck

174
00:15:20.592 --> 00:15:21.527
you.

175
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.931
I know

176
00:15:27.065 --> 00:15:28.534
about you two.

177
00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:30.268
(uneasy music continues)

178
00:15:30.301 --> 00:15:31.270
- Whatever.

179
00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:34.873
You're gonna die
in this fucking car


180
00:15:34.906 --> 00:15:37.576
if you don't tell me
where we were going.


181
00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:42.347
Adios motherfucker!

182
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:47.486
- Ricky!
(gun shot fires)


183
00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:49.487
- No names.

184
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.022
- What the fuck did
you do that for?


185
00:15:51.056 --> 00:15:52.724
- Well, stop pretending
like you give a shit.


186
00:15:52.758 --> 00:15:53.725
He's dead.

187
00:15:54.893 --> 00:15:56.762
- I don't give a
fuck about that.


188
00:15:56.795 --> 00:15:59.130
He was the only one who
knew where we were going.


189
00:15:59.164 --> 00:16:00.698
- [Eric] He wasn't
gonna tell us.


190
00:16:00.732 --> 00:16:01.900
- [Sarah] Are you
fucking kidding me?


191
00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:03.401
I could've gotten it out of him.

192
00:16:03.435 --> 00:16:05.169
- He knew, okay.

193
00:16:05.203 --> 00:16:07.372
I don't know how he
knew, but he knew.


194
00:16:07.405 --> 00:16:09.074
And I've known him
much longer than you.


195
00:16:09.107 --> 00:16:11.243
He wasn't going to tell us.

196
00:16:13.612 --> 00:16:15.113
- You two are?

197
00:16:15.147 --> 00:16:16.781
- Yes, Josh, we are.

198
00:16:16.815 --> 00:16:18.116
- I said no fucking names.

199
00:16:18.149 --> 00:16:20.252
- What fucking
difference does it make?


200
00:16:20.285 --> 00:16:21.419
- We're not done.

201
00:16:21.452 --> 00:16:22.654
This is not over.

202
00:16:22.687 --> 00:16:24.288
- Yes, it is

203
00:16:24.322 --> 00:16:26.758
because we don't know
where the fuck to go.


204
00:16:26.791 --> 00:16:30.429
And even if we did,
we can't get there.


205
00:16:32.263 --> 00:16:33.431
- Stay the fuck away from there.

206
00:16:33.464 --> 00:16:34.666
Back the fuck off.

207
00:16:34.699 --> 00:16:36.101
- Don't.

208
00:16:36.134 --> 00:16:38.669
We are in the middle
of the fucking road,


209
00:16:38.703 --> 00:16:40.839
in the middle of
the fucking day.


210
00:16:40.872 --> 00:16:43.308
You just shot our
entire plan in the face.


211
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:46.512
I think you need to give it
a rest and fucking chill out.


212
00:16:48.313 --> 00:16:50.148
- Stay away from there.

213
00:16:50.182 --> 00:16:52.818
(insects thrumming)

214
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:55.019
- It's not gonna be long
before somebody comes and,


215
00:16:55.053 --> 00:16:56.388
and finds this.

216
00:16:56.421 --> 00:16:58.624
We can't just be
standing here waiting.


217
00:17:02.527 --> 00:17:03.962
What are you doing?

218
00:17:03.995 --> 00:17:05.931
- He's gonna have
something on him.


219
00:17:05.964 --> 00:17:06.965
An address,

220
00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:08.433
a phone number,

221
00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:09.468
something.

222
00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:15.206
- All right, I'm not
gonna say it again.


223
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.407
Get over there.

224
00:17:16.441 --> 00:17:19.578
(insects thrumming)

225
00:17:21.213 --> 00:17:22.380
- Here we go.

226
00:17:22.414 --> 00:17:23.382
- What is it?

227
00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:24.649
- It's a phone number.

228
00:17:24.682 --> 00:17:25.717
- Is there a name?

229
00:17:26.718 --> 00:17:27.653
- No.

230
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.288
- Of course.

231
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:31.557
It's probably your
contact down the road.


232
00:17:32.524 --> 00:17:33.992
- Yeah, and so what?

233
00:17:34.025 --> 00:17:35.526
How the fuck are we
gonna call it, huh?


234
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.429
Payphone back at
the gas station?


235
00:17:38.196 --> 00:17:41.266
(truck approaching)

236
00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:44.937
(uneasy music)

237
00:17:48.273 --> 00:17:49.174
Fuck.

238
00:17:49.207 --> 00:17:50.908
(uneasy music continues)

239
00:17:50.942 --> 00:17:53.277
- Hey!
- What are you, nuts?


240
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:54.378
What are you doing?

241
00:17:54.412 --> 00:17:55.580
- What does it look like?

242
00:17:55.614 --> 00:17:58.283
Hey, help!
- Hey, help!


243
00:17:58.316 --> 00:18:01.887
(uneasy music continues)

244
00:18:04.456 --> 00:18:06.291
- [Randy] Holy shit.

245
00:18:07.392 --> 00:18:08.393
You folks all right?

246
00:18:08.426 --> 00:18:09.394
- No,

247
00:18:09.428 --> 00:18:11.363
my boyfriend, he's.

248
00:18:12.563 --> 00:18:13.832
- Oh Jesus, Mary,
God damn to hell.


249
00:18:13.865 --> 00:18:15.968
- We need to get to a phone.

250
00:18:17.736 --> 00:18:18.971
- Yeah, no problem, but

251
00:18:20.038 --> 00:18:21.706
I can only take two of you.

252
00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.774
- That's fine.

253
00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:24.108
I'll stay here.

254
00:18:24.142 --> 00:18:25.944
- No, I'll stay here,
you go with her.


255
00:18:28.113 --> 00:18:29.214
- Is he dead?

256
00:18:29.247 --> 00:18:30.114
- Yeah.

257
00:18:30.148 --> 00:18:31.216
The elk killed him.

258
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.220
- Don't you think we should
call the police or something?


259
00:18:35.253 --> 00:18:37.522
- Yeah, we should.

260
00:18:37.556 --> 00:18:40.259
(uneasy music)

261
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:45.797
- Hey, how far up the
road is the phone?


262
00:18:46.965 --> 00:18:49.101
- Gas station's backed
that way a couple miles.


263
00:18:49.134 --> 00:18:51.435
I'm sure you passed
it on the way here.


264
00:18:51.469 --> 00:18:53.405
- Okay, I'll go with you.

265
00:18:53.438 --> 00:18:54.439
Me and my cousin.

266
00:18:54.472 --> 00:18:55.641
Get outta here.
- Josh!


267
00:18:56.842 --> 00:18:58.643
(gun shot fires)

268
00:18:58.677 --> 00:19:01.313
(tense music)

269
00:19:07.685 --> 00:19:09.254
Are you fucking kidding me?

270
00:19:09.287 --> 00:19:11.590
What the fuck are you thinking?

271
00:19:11.623 --> 00:19:12.791
- We said no killing.

272
00:19:14.025 --> 00:19:15.160
- Fuck!

273
00:19:15.193 --> 00:19:18.297
(tyres screeching)

274
00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:22.233
I'll fucking kill you,
you dipshit motherfucker!


275
00:19:22.266 --> 00:19:23.935
- Don't you fucking shoot him.

276
00:19:23.968 --> 00:19:25.770
- If you had just let me ride
to the gas station with him,


277
00:19:25.803 --> 00:19:26.804
you could've been long gone
before anybody got here.


278
00:19:26.838 --> 00:19:27.773
- Oh yeah.

279
00:19:27.806 --> 00:19:29.240
And have you rat us out?

280
00:19:29.274 --> 00:19:30.776
- I'm not gonna rat
on my own cousin.


281
00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:31.976
- You are gonna
take her with you.


282
00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:33.378
- You're as paranoid as he was.

283
00:19:33.411 --> 00:19:34.345
I wouldn't rat you out.

284
00:19:34.378 --> 00:19:35.514
- Oh yeah, right?

285
00:19:37.148 --> 00:19:38.449
- That was so fucking stupid.

286
00:19:38.483 --> 00:19:39.484
Why did you do that?

287
00:19:39.518 --> 00:19:40.619
- We all agreed.

288
00:19:40.652 --> 00:19:42.053
No killing.

289
00:19:42.086 --> 00:19:43.254
- Well, I'd say that
the plan has changed.


290
00:19:43.288 --> 00:19:44.990
- No, it hasn't.

291
00:19:46.224 --> 00:19:48.627
Open the fucking trunk.

292
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.230
(uneasy music continues)

293
00:19:56.367 --> 00:19:57.903
- We're not gonna hurt you.

294
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.139
- Get the fuck outta the trunk

295
00:20:01.172 --> 00:20:03.008
before I blow your
fucking head off.


296
00:20:06.077 --> 00:20:08.513
- Just get her outta the
fucking trunk, please.


297
00:20:08.546 --> 00:20:11.650
(cicadas whirring)

298
00:20:19.156 --> 00:20:21.526
- All right, we need
to get off this road.


299
00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:23.328
Let's go.

300
00:20:25.763 --> 00:20:27.732
I'm serious, let's go.

301
00:20:27.765 --> 00:20:30.869
(cicadas whirring)

302
00:20:38.376 --> 00:20:41.079
(uneasy music)

303
00:21:24.923 --> 00:21:26.558
- Just relax for a second.

304
00:21:40.238 --> 00:21:42.941
(uneasy music)

305
00:21:49.113 --> 00:21:52.117
(engine rumbling)

306
00:21:57.189 --> 00:21:59.925
(horn honking)

307
00:22:02.193 --> 00:22:05.797
(uneasy music continues)

308
00:22:23.815 --> 00:22:24.783
- Crusher.

309
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:26.818
Hey Crusher.

310
00:22:28.053 --> 00:22:29.754
Hey, come on.

311
00:22:29.787 --> 00:22:31.823
We got interestin'
developments at hand.


312
00:22:31.856 --> 00:22:32.857
Grab the shackles.

313
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:34.292
- [Crusher] No.

314
00:22:35.994 --> 00:22:38.230
- Hey, come on.

315
00:22:40.164 --> 00:22:43.467
Don't be moping around here
lower than a doodle bug, okay.


316
00:22:43.501 --> 00:22:46.004
That girl weren't never
gonna be your friend.


317
00:22:47.171 --> 00:22:50.308
Now we got some
unexpected guests


318
00:22:50.341 --> 00:22:51.976
that I reckon gonna
make you happier


319
00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:53.812
than a dog with two peckers.

320
00:22:54.545 --> 00:22:55.881
So grab the shackles.

321
00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:05.023
(uneasy music continues)

322
00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.049
- Where exactly are we going?

323
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.686
- We're gonna find another
road, find another driver,


324
00:23:35.719 --> 00:23:37.855
get to a phone and finish this.

325
00:23:37.888 --> 00:23:39.057
- What do we do with the driver?

326
00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.524
- Whatever we need to.

327
00:23:40.558 --> 00:23:42.260
Keep your cousin in check.

328
00:23:43.427 --> 00:23:45.162
- If this phone number
gets us nowhere,


329
00:23:45.196 --> 00:23:48.199
then all of this was for
nothing and we're on the run.


330
00:23:48.233 --> 00:23:51.369
- We're probably gonna be on
the run after this anyway.


331
00:23:51.402 --> 00:23:53.204
We just have nothing
to show for it.


332
00:23:53.238 --> 00:23:55.907
- Were you always
planning on killing Brian?


333
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.041
- No.

334
00:23:57.075 --> 00:23:58.810
I meant what I said

335
00:23:58.843 --> 00:24:01.045
when I said let's grab his
share and leave together.


336
00:24:01.078 --> 00:24:03.315
But like you said,
the plan changed.


337
00:24:04.415 --> 00:24:06.651
Let's hope it
doesn't change again.


338
00:24:06.684 --> 00:24:09.087
- [Sarah] I'll make
sure it doesn't.


339
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.724
(uneasy music continues)

340
00:24:35.246 --> 00:24:37.415
- [Eric] What are you doing?

341
00:24:37.448 --> 00:24:38.683
- Don't worry about it.

342
00:24:45.623 --> 00:24:48.159
Just relax.

343
00:24:48.192 --> 00:24:49.127
Okay.

344
00:24:50.828 --> 00:24:52.864
- [Eric] Are you
fucking kidding me?


345
00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:56.267
- This is what happens
when you snatch somebody.


346
00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.869
They don't grab their shoes.

347
00:25:01.672 --> 00:25:04.809
- Are you sure you don't wanna
just give her your shoes?


348
00:25:13.651 --> 00:25:14.619
- [Josh] Come on.

349
00:25:15.687 --> 00:25:16.888
There you go.

350
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.164
(uneasy music continues)

351
00:25:28.767 --> 00:25:30.602
- [Sarah] Rather than
sweeping her off her feet,


352
00:25:30.635 --> 00:25:33.805
why don't you just try and
keep her off the ground?


353
00:25:33.838 --> 00:25:37.375
(uneasy music continues)

354
00:25:46.517 --> 00:25:51.756
(cicadas whirring)
(gravel crunching)


355
00:25:53.191 --> 00:25:56.728
(uneasy music continues)

356
00:27:22.113 --> 00:27:23.848
- [Josh] Watch out.

357
00:27:31.989 --> 00:27:33.491
- All right, that's it.

358
00:27:34.758 --> 00:27:35.860
Get away from her.

359
00:27:36.628 --> 00:27:37.795
- She needs my help.

360
00:27:37.828 --> 00:27:38.929
- No, she does it.

361
00:27:38.963 --> 00:27:39.931
None of us do.

362
00:27:39.964 --> 00:27:40.764
- What are you doing?

363
00:27:40.798 --> 00:27:42.033
- You shut up.

364
00:27:42.066 --> 00:27:43.134
Get away from her.

365
00:27:44.835 --> 00:27:46.437
- Don't hurt her.

366
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.806
- She's perfectly safe, Romeo.

367
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.940
But you ain't.

368
00:27:49.973 --> 00:27:51.608
- Don't you fucking shoot him.

369
00:27:51.642 --> 00:27:53.945
- I'd be worried about
yourself if I were you.


370
00:27:53.978 --> 00:27:57.115
You see we're in an "all bets
are off" kind of world now.


371
00:27:57.148 --> 00:27:59.484
- You fucking asshole.

372
00:27:59.517 --> 00:28:01.819
(chuckling)

373
00:28:01.853 --> 00:28:03.254
- Oh baby.

374
00:28:03.287 --> 00:28:05.557
I kidnapped some
Rich Daddy's girl.


375
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:08.226
Fucked my best
friend's dirty slut,


376
00:28:09.326 --> 00:28:10.962
and then I shot him in the face,

377
00:28:10.995 --> 00:28:13.364
all without a
moment's hesitation.


378
00:28:13.397 --> 00:28:16.568
Fucking asshole doesn't
even begin to describe me!


379
00:28:17.335 --> 00:28:18.536
Now stand next to him.

380
00:28:20.037 --> 00:28:21.339
- On clever shit, man.

381
00:28:22.206 --> 00:28:23.608
Play along for a little while.

382
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:25.043
Get us to walk
ourselves out here.


383
00:28:25.076 --> 00:28:26.611
Were you, were you
planning this all along


384
00:28:26.644 --> 00:28:28.613
or did you just
come up with it now?


385
00:28:28.646 --> 00:28:31.048
- What fucking
difference does it make?


386
00:28:31.082 --> 00:28:33.817
(gun shot fires)

387
00:28:33.851 --> 00:28:36.487
(tense music)

388
00:28:43.194 --> 00:28:44.395
- Whooo-weee!

389
00:28:47.598 --> 00:28:49.500
Well that was a close one.

390
00:28:49.533 --> 00:28:50.501
Wouldn't you say?

391
00:28:56.874 --> 00:28:59.944
Gotta admit though, I liked him.

392
00:29:00.745 --> 00:29:03.347
He was my kinda hombre.

393
00:29:03.381 --> 00:29:04.648
- Thank you so much.

394
00:29:04.682 --> 00:29:05.849
He grabbed us on the road.

395
00:29:05.883 --> 00:29:07.184
He crashed into us.

396
00:29:07.217 --> 00:29:08.552
He had this girl in his trunk.

397
00:29:08.585 --> 00:29:10.020
He he was gonna--

398
00:29:10.054 --> 00:29:13.691
- Honey, I can respect
a ruthless kidnapping.


399
00:29:14.792 --> 00:29:17.061
I can admire a
coldblooded killer.


400
00:29:18.562 --> 00:29:20.364
And I can even see my way to
appreciating how you worked


401
00:29:20.397 --> 00:29:23.167
that slick little
poontang of yours


402
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.371
to twist man's dicks up worse
than spaghetti on a Sunday.


403
00:29:27.605 --> 00:29:30.308
But I ain't got no
time for your bullshit.


404
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:33.144
Back to where you was.

405
00:29:39.784 --> 00:29:40.884
Now.

406
00:29:40.918 --> 00:29:42.220
Hmm.

407
00:29:42.253 --> 00:29:44.656
Who in the hell
dressed this girl?


408
00:29:45.956 --> 00:29:47.492
Oh goddamn.

409
00:29:48.726 --> 00:29:50.828
We could see clear on
to the promised land.


410
00:29:52.263 --> 00:29:54.098
I do like the bag though.

411
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:55.399
(chuckling)

412
00:29:55.432 --> 00:29:58.069
It gives her a bit of mystery.

413
00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:01.739
- Hey!

414
00:30:01.773 --> 00:30:04.642
(dramatic music)

415
00:30:05.877 --> 00:30:07.744
- Now you ain't going
want none of this boy.


416
00:30:07.778 --> 00:30:10.481
We's lower than a snake
belly in a waggon rut.


417
00:30:13.117 --> 00:30:14.018
- Who's we?

418
00:30:15.453 --> 00:30:18.489
- Oh, you going to
find us soon enough.


419
00:30:23.427 --> 00:30:24.795
Now.

420
00:30:24.828 --> 00:30:25.763
Get up

421
00:30:31.435 --> 00:30:32.370
and get on.

422
00:30:34.472 --> 00:30:36.106
- Where are we going?

423
00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.843
- Oh, you all done left a
genuine prize on that road.


424
00:30:39.644 --> 00:30:42.913
I aim to collect it.

425
00:30:42.947 --> 00:30:44.281
(clicks tongue)

426
00:30:44.315 --> 00:30:46.951
(uneasy music)

427
00:30:48.151 --> 00:30:50.420
You ain't gotta worry
about her, Casanova.


428
00:30:50.454 --> 00:30:52.623
She going to be just
fine where she is.


429
00:30:55.626 --> 00:30:58.329
(uneasy music)

430
00:31:08.205 --> 00:31:11.209
(engine rumbling)

431
00:31:23.987 --> 00:31:25.690
- Gonna have to use your phone.

432
00:31:26.524 --> 00:31:29.994
(rotary phone spinning)

433
00:31:32.529 --> 00:31:35.433
(old timey music)

434
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.270
Yeah, this is Wilbur Jenkins.

435
00:31:39.303 --> 00:31:41.872
You'll wanna send
Sheriff Hill down here.


436
00:31:41.906 --> 00:31:44.609
(uneasy music)

437
00:32:29.053 --> 00:32:31.889
(Crusher grunts)

438
00:32:38.095 --> 00:32:41.666
(uneasy music continues)

439
00:33:18.535 --> 00:33:19.837
- Go on.

440
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:24.709
(frogs croaking)
(insects thrumming)


441
00:33:40.591 --> 00:33:41.826
Ankles and wrists.

442
00:33:42.692 --> 00:33:44.395
It don't matter who goes first.

443
00:33:46.364 --> 00:33:49.066
(uneasy music)

444
00:34:20.063 --> 00:34:22.533
(chuckling)

445
00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:24.569
All right.

446
00:34:26.504 --> 00:34:27.405
You,

447
00:34:28.705 --> 00:34:30.441
cut 'em just over the shoulder,

448
00:34:31.375 --> 00:34:32.510
bottom of the neck.

449
00:34:33.376 --> 00:34:34.946
And you keep as much as you can.

450
00:34:39.483 --> 00:34:41.051
- You want me to
hack its head off?


451
00:34:41.084 --> 00:34:42.753
- Oh, that is why we're here.

452
00:35:12.082 --> 00:35:13.050
(chuckling)

453
00:35:13.084 --> 00:35:14.885
Goddamn it, boy.

454
00:35:14.918 --> 00:35:16.587
He ain't going to buck you.

455
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.089
He's deader than Jesus.

456
00:35:19.756 --> 00:35:21.959
Stop diddling and
cut his fucking head
off like I told you.


457
00:35:25.796 --> 00:35:31.068
(Josh grunting)
(flesh squishing)


458
00:36:01.098 --> 00:36:02.033
All right.

459
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.769
Toss the blade towards me.

460
00:36:13.677 --> 00:36:16.314
Now get on up and get it out.

461
00:36:23.687 --> 00:36:27.291
(uneasy music continues)

462
00:36:56.654 --> 00:36:58.154
There you go.

463
00:36:58.188 --> 00:36:59.522
All right,

464
00:36:59.556 --> 00:37:01.425
boy get on down and take
it from your girlfriend.


465
00:37:01.458 --> 00:37:04.528
- It's not my girlfriend,
she's my cousin.


466
00:37:05.862 --> 00:37:07.331
- Same difference around here.

467
00:37:07.364 --> 00:37:10.935
(uneasy music continues)

468
00:37:30.221 --> 00:37:31.355
Let's get a move on.

469
00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:36.693
- You don't want
any of the meat?


470
00:37:36.727 --> 00:37:38.963
- Nah, we don't eat them.

471
00:37:41.064 --> 00:37:43.300
- Where are we going?

472
00:37:44.935 --> 00:37:45.903
- That way.

473
00:37:51.341 --> 00:37:54.311
And you can just die
right here if you want.


474
00:37:54.344 --> 00:37:57.047
I took your boy down
at 50 yards, princess


475
00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.049
and he wasn't
wearing no shackles.


476
00:38:00.884 --> 00:38:02.987
Anytime you want to
make a run for it,


477
00:38:03.921 --> 00:38:05.222
you be my guest.

478
00:38:05.255 --> 00:38:10.494
(uneasy music)
(insects thrumming)


479
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:31.916
(cicadas whirring)
(engines rumbling)


480
00:38:46.129 --> 00:38:47.798
- [Dispatcher] All
units, all units,


481
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:49.533
be on the lookout
for four suspects


482
00:38:49.566 --> 00:38:51.602
in a green, late
model four door sedan.


483
00:38:51.635 --> 00:38:54.871
Three males, one female,
early to mid-20s.


484
00:38:54.904 --> 00:38:57.808
Wanted for questioning in a
kidnapping early this morning,


485
00:38:57.841 --> 00:39:01.412
most likely headed
towards Spencerville.


486
00:39:01.445 --> 00:39:05.883
- Hey sheriff, sounds a
little familiar don't it?


487
00:39:08.018 --> 00:39:10.054
- The very definition
of the word.


488
00:39:15.025 --> 00:39:17.728
(uneasy music)

489
00:39:22.499 --> 00:39:25.169
Wilbur, do me a favour.

490
00:39:25.202 --> 00:39:26.504
- [Wilbur] Sure thing.

491
00:39:27.637 --> 00:39:29.573
- I'm gonna radio
deputy to come on down.


492
00:39:30.841 --> 00:39:32.409
I'd like you to wait
until he gets here.


493
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:34.912
- I ain't got
nowhere else to be.


494
00:39:36.046 --> 00:39:37.147
- Much obliged.

495
00:39:39.049 --> 00:39:42.653
(uneasy music continues)

496
00:39:54.931 --> 00:39:58.035
(Crusher grunting)

497
00:40:07.811 --> 00:40:11.382
(uneasy music continues)

498
00:40:43.747 --> 00:40:46.650
(hostage gasping)

499
00:40:59.797 --> 00:41:02.566
(loud thudding)

500
00:41:08.672 --> 00:41:11.408
(tense music)

501
00:41:23.954 --> 00:41:25.622
- [Josh] Where's our friend?

502
00:41:25.655 --> 00:41:26.723
- [Clyde] Friend?

503
00:41:26.756 --> 00:41:27.758
What?

504
00:41:27.791 --> 00:41:29.960
Kidnap all your friends.

505
00:41:30.994 --> 00:41:32.262
- You know what I mean.

506
00:41:32.295 --> 00:41:34.098
- [Clyde] It's like I told you.

507
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:37.201
You're gonna find
out soon enough.


508
00:41:45.642 --> 00:41:49.213
(uneasy music continues)

509
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.128
- Dispatch, this
is Sheriff Hill.


510
00:43:45.161 --> 00:43:46.562
Come in.

511
00:43:46.596 --> 00:43:48.264
- [Dispatcher] Sheriff
Hill, this is dispatch.


512
00:43:48.298 --> 00:43:49.266
Go ahead.

513
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.670
- I'm Southbound Rural Road Four

514
00:43:54.871 --> 00:43:57.775
about 11 miles outta
Silver Seven station.


515
00:43:59.176 --> 00:44:01.779
Pretty sure I found that
car we're looking for.


516
00:44:02.913 --> 00:44:04.615
- [Dispatcher]
Roger that sheriff,


517
00:44:04.648 --> 00:44:06.449
be advised it's confirmed
they did kidnap a young woman


518
00:44:06.482 --> 00:44:09.586
from the city college campus
dormitory this morning.


519
00:44:09.619 --> 00:44:11.855
They're likely
armed and dangerous.


520
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:15.359
- They are most certainly that.

521
00:44:16.793 --> 00:44:19.262
I'm guessing they're the
ones Randy Hallbrook ran into


522
00:44:19.296 --> 00:44:21.464
before meeting the maker.

523
00:44:21.497 --> 00:44:23.600
One of 'em dead here on site.

524
00:44:25.335 --> 00:44:26.636
Looks like a raghorn

525
00:44:26.669 --> 00:44:28.905
went through the
windshield, impaled him.


526
00:44:28.938 --> 00:44:32.809
But cause of death
appears to be a gunshot


527
00:44:32.842 --> 00:44:34.545
pointblank to the face.

528
00:44:35.812 --> 00:44:37.948
No sign of the other three.

529
00:44:38.949 --> 00:44:40.617
Or the girl they grabbed.

530
00:44:41.852 --> 00:44:44.154
And for some reason,

531
00:44:45.489 --> 00:44:47.457
they took the elk's head.

532
00:44:49.659 --> 00:44:50.827
- [Dispatcher]
Well that's nuttier


533
00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.530
than a squirrel turd, Sheriff.

534
00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:00.336
- Leave whatever deputy
you sent to Wilbur Jenkins


535
00:45:00.369 --> 00:45:02.739
and send someone else out here.

536
00:45:04.174 --> 00:45:07.144
I wanna follow the blood trail
westbound into the woods.


537
00:45:08.278 --> 00:45:09.846
- [Dispatcher]
Roger that, Sheriff.


538
00:45:09.879 --> 00:45:11.581
Be careful.

539
00:45:11.615 --> 00:45:13.650
- Thank you, I will.

540
00:45:13.684 --> 00:45:14.885
Over and out.

541
00:45:27.864 --> 00:45:28.899
- Crusher.

542
00:45:34.003 --> 00:45:35.906
Did you get the girl?

543
00:45:35.939 --> 00:45:37.307
- Yeah.

544
00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.010
- Alright, show him
where he put the head.


545
00:45:46.249 --> 00:45:48.118
Boy, if your brains was leather,

546
00:45:48.151 --> 00:45:50.487
you wouldn't have enough
to saddle a junebug.


547
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.455
Go with him.

548
00:45:55.625 --> 00:45:59.029
Is he always that stupid
or just on Sundays?


549
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.232
Girly, you best put
a smile on that face


550
00:46:02.265 --> 00:46:04.134
'fore I cut one into it.

551
00:46:08.738 --> 00:46:10.307
Well that'll do for a start.

552
00:46:11.341 --> 00:46:12.676
Let's go.

553
00:46:12.709 --> 00:46:17.581
(birds singing)
(insects thrumming)


554
00:46:24.421 --> 00:46:29.660
(birds singing)
(Crusher grunting)


555
00:47:04.894 --> 00:47:05.829
Have a seat.

556
00:47:11.134 --> 00:47:13.870
I said sit the fuck down.

557
00:47:17.107 --> 00:47:18.308
Good god, girl.

558
00:47:19.775 --> 00:47:22.546
You sure do make it a lot more
difficult than needs to be.


559
00:47:31.788 --> 00:47:34.658
(Crusher grunts)

560
00:47:38.995 --> 00:47:41.131
Now you must be parched.

561
00:47:48.305 --> 00:47:49.806
So where were y'all headed

562
00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.842
with that little
lady friend of yours?


563
00:47:52.875 --> 00:47:55.812
- If I tell you, I lose
my bargaining chip.


564
00:47:58.347 --> 00:47:59.383
- Bargaining chip?

565
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:02.052
You're looking to make a deal?

566
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:04.487
(uneasy music)

567
00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.223
- She's worth a lot of money.

568
00:48:08.524 --> 00:48:10.660
You let me go, you keep her.

569
00:48:11.861 --> 00:48:13.329
I call you with
the where and when


570
00:48:13.362 --> 00:48:15.131
we were going to
pick up the ransom.


571
00:48:15.165 --> 00:48:16.533
You do it,

572
00:48:16.566 --> 00:48:17.734
you're rich.

573
00:48:21.804 --> 00:48:23.407
- And what about your cousin?

574
00:48:25.275 --> 00:48:26.209
- Him too.

575
00:48:26.242 --> 00:48:27.210
Let him go.

576
00:48:29.545 --> 00:48:32.282
- And how much is this ransom?

577
00:48:33.883 --> 00:48:35.217
- Quarter million.

578
00:48:35.251 --> 00:48:37.621
(whistles)

579
00:48:39.255 --> 00:48:42.125
- But you ain't
touched your lemonade.


580
00:48:45.061 --> 00:48:46.329
- Not thirsty.

581
00:48:46.363 --> 00:48:48.031
(uneasy music)

582
00:48:48.064 --> 00:48:51.968
- Well now, you ain't had
much house training have you?


583
00:48:53.403 --> 00:48:57.240
A cold drink on a hot
day is a kind gesture.


584
00:48:58.741 --> 00:49:01.278
Some would consider it rude
to turn your nose up at it.


585
00:49:02.412 --> 00:49:05.382
- I don't take drinks
from strangers.


586
00:49:05.415 --> 00:49:07.850
(uneasy music continues)

587
00:49:07.884 --> 00:49:08.819
- That's right.

588
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.555
We are still
strangers, ain't we?


589
00:49:12.755 --> 00:49:14.691
Now that is my fault.

590
00:49:14.724 --> 00:49:16.226
(chuckling)

591
00:49:16.259 --> 00:49:18.061
Who's the rude one now, huh?

592
00:49:28.238 --> 00:49:29.406
My name's Clyde.

593
00:49:33.443 --> 00:49:34.344
- Sarah.

594
00:49:44.754 --> 00:49:45.655
- There.

595
00:49:48.825 --> 00:49:53.763
Now that we've been properly
introduced, you may drink.


596
00:49:57.934 --> 00:49:59.469
- It's poisoned, isn't it?

597
00:50:01.904 --> 00:50:04.941
- Sarah, I am on sick,

598
00:50:04.974 --> 00:50:08.611
sadistic, twisted motherfucker.

599
00:50:08.644 --> 00:50:11.615
But I ain't stupid enough
to spoil that meat.


600
00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:17.554
- You're like those people in
the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre".


601
00:50:18.321 --> 00:50:19.689
- Nah.

602
00:50:19.722 --> 00:50:21.224
This ain't Texas.

603
00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:26.663
Now be a good little
guest and drink up.


604
00:50:31.167 --> 00:50:33.136
I am just trying
to be neighbourly.


605
00:50:37.874 --> 00:50:39.809
You best do the same.

606
00:50:39.843 --> 00:50:42.546
(uneasy music)

607
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.932
I like you,

608
00:51:04.034 --> 00:51:07.070
but I don't think I'm gonna
take you up on your offer.


609
00:51:09.605 --> 00:51:10.740
I think you

610
00:51:10.774 --> 00:51:12.341
and your cousin

611
00:51:12.375 --> 00:51:14.877
and that sweet little
peach you got with you


612
00:51:14.911 --> 00:51:16.413
are gonna stay right here.

613
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.916
(tense music)

614
00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:31.093
Oh, I was out of
ammo a while ago.


615
00:51:31.127 --> 00:51:33.863
(uneasy music)

616
00:51:40.136 --> 00:51:41.271
Oh.

617
00:51:41.304 --> 00:51:45.074
(uneasy music continues)

618
00:51:45.108 --> 00:51:47.343
(Sarah's body thuds)

619
00:51:47.376 --> 00:51:48.545
Bye for now.

620
00:52:00.123 --> 00:52:04.561
Oh, you must have been
a bad little girl.


621
00:52:07.897 --> 00:52:08.798
Hmm.

622
00:52:18.441 --> 00:52:20.143
Bag is a nice touch.

623
00:52:21.443 --> 00:52:23.146
Wish I thought of that myself.

624
00:52:25.648 --> 00:52:26.583
Hey.

625
00:52:29.118 --> 00:52:30.020
Hey.

626
00:52:50.173 --> 00:52:52.876
(uneasy music)

627
00:52:56.446 --> 00:52:57.380
Well now,

628
00:52:59.149 --> 00:53:00.950
that is interesting.

629
00:53:03.652 --> 00:53:05.388
Well ain't you the clever one.

630
00:53:07.724 --> 00:53:10.960
And you so pretty, you can
make a hound dog smile.


631
00:53:12.995 --> 00:53:14.064
What's your name?

632
00:53:16.398 --> 00:53:19.669
Oh, you ain't gotta
be scared little lady.


633
00:53:19.702 --> 00:53:23.172
I ain't never, it's hurt
something as pretty as you.


634
00:53:23.205 --> 00:53:26.509
Well, not by choice anyway.

635
00:53:29.245 --> 00:53:33.983
Now you are gonna be
our guest for a while.


636
00:53:34.016 --> 00:53:37.187
So we're gonna move
you somewhere a little
more comfortable,


637
00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:38.488
a little more private.

638
00:53:40.023 --> 00:53:42.992
I understand this has
not been your lucky day.


639
00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.229
Oh, it does seem to be mine.

640
00:53:49.866 --> 00:53:53.002
So I'm going to give you
a little time to yourself


641
00:53:53.035 --> 00:53:55.238
while I deal with your friends.

642
00:53:56.572 --> 00:53:58.841
Now you've already
met my brother,


643
00:53:58.874 --> 00:54:00.443
but you ain't seen him yet.

644
00:54:01.878 --> 00:54:05.381
He ain't sensitive about
his appearance or nothing.


645
00:54:05.415 --> 00:54:08.784
But it would be best if
you kept yourself calm,


646
00:54:08.817 --> 00:54:12.522
which don't seem to
be a problem for you.


647
00:54:13.556 --> 00:54:15.291
And just go along with him.

648
00:54:16.525 --> 00:54:18.160
He ain't going to
do nothing to you


649
00:54:18.194 --> 00:54:19.596
that I don't tell him to.

650
00:54:22.231 --> 00:54:26.302
Can you at least nod that you
understand what I'm saying?


651
00:54:31.407 --> 00:54:32.308
Good.

652
00:54:33.743 --> 00:54:34.644
Crusher.

653
00:54:46.422 --> 00:54:49.826
You definitely going to
be the star of the show.


654
00:54:51.627 --> 00:54:52.896
Take her to the shed.

655
00:55:00.669 --> 00:55:03.773
(insects chirping)

656
00:55:39.709 --> 00:55:42.378
(uneasy music)

657
00:56:04.167 --> 00:56:06.803
(blues music)

658
00:56:55.885 --> 00:56:58.688
(flies buzzing)

659
00:57:10.065 --> 00:57:11.534
Well, I'm gonna
have me a little fun


660
00:57:11.567 --> 00:57:13.436
with this one before
we hang her up.


661
00:57:16.905 --> 00:57:18.608
Go put a loverboy in the chair.

662
00:57:22.979 --> 00:57:25.715
(uneasy music)

663
00:57:55.011 --> 00:57:55.945
Hey.

664
00:57:58.848 --> 00:57:59.782
Hey.

665
00:58:03.285 --> 00:58:04.753
Well there you go.

666
00:58:04.787 --> 00:58:07.357
Now you don't wanna miss
your own demise do you?


667
00:58:09.492 --> 00:58:13.695
Not much fun being all
bagged up, is it now?


668
00:58:13.729 --> 00:58:15.097
Mind you,

669
00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:17.600
this does seem to be
a fitting predicament


670
00:58:17.633 --> 00:58:19.034
for a little cunt like you.

671
00:58:19.068 --> 00:58:20.603
- [Sarah] Fuck you.

672
00:58:20.636 --> 00:58:23.206
You fucking piece
of shit hick fuck.


673
00:58:24.106 --> 00:58:26.142
- Oh, bless your heart, darling.

674
00:58:26.175 --> 00:58:28.444
It's a little late
to sweet talk me now.


675
00:58:29.511 --> 00:58:30.647
But by all means,

676
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:32.682
you keep on trying.

677
00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:36.219
I said keep trying.

678
00:58:39.488 --> 00:58:41.224
You goddamn fucking wimps.

679
00:58:42.124 --> 00:58:43.693
Y'all just give in, don't you?

680
00:58:44.827 --> 00:58:49.732
(Clyde whistling)
(uneasy music)


681
00:58:52.534 --> 00:58:54.570
If I were in your position,

682
00:58:55.471 --> 00:58:56.839
I'd be yelling and cussing,

683
00:58:57.573 --> 00:58:58.741
fighting and kicking.

684
00:58:59.975 --> 00:59:01.778
But you best believe
if I'm going to die,


685
00:59:01.811 --> 00:59:03.713
I ain't going out
all quite like.


686
00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:05.748
But you all,

687
00:59:06.916 --> 00:59:08.818
you all just shut
up and give up.


688
00:59:10.352 --> 00:59:13.890
Some of you try to appeal
to my softer nature,


689
00:59:14.723 --> 00:59:15.858
my humanity,

690
00:59:17.025 --> 00:59:19.628
as if that were
there to begin with.


691
00:59:19.661 --> 00:59:22.831
Now maybe you could
talk me out of it, huh?


692
00:59:22.865 --> 00:59:25.501
As though there was some
alternative to you just


693
00:59:25.535 --> 00:59:27.469
ending up in pieces

694
00:59:27.503 --> 00:59:28.905
on my barbecue.

695
00:59:31.274 --> 00:59:34.077
And here you got your ribs

696
00:59:35.378 --> 00:59:36.345
and your round

697
00:59:39.115 --> 00:59:40.682
and your loins.

698
00:59:40.716 --> 00:59:43.185
(whistles)

699
00:59:43.218 --> 00:59:45.054
All the meat you's got to offer.

700
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:49.625
Now, normally we'd hack you
up for meat after you're dead.


701
00:59:50.893 --> 00:59:51.861
But today,

702
00:59:53.195 --> 00:59:55.198
'cause you're a
particular kind of bitch,


703
00:59:55.231 --> 00:59:57.200
we going to do
while you're alive,


704
00:59:58.367 --> 01:00:00.269
or at least carve
into you a little bit


705
01:00:00.303 --> 01:00:02.271
here and there.

706
01:00:04.474 --> 01:00:05.441
I like to ask,

707
01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:09.177
what is it that's going
through your mind right now?


708
01:00:09.211 --> 01:00:10.113
Hmm?

709
01:00:11.914 --> 01:00:12.782
Am I bluffing

710
01:00:13.916 --> 01:00:14.817
or if not,

711
01:00:15.918 --> 01:00:16.886
will it hurt?

712
01:00:18.787 --> 01:00:19.789
Will you survive?

713
01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:22.891
Is that it?

714
01:00:22.924 --> 01:00:24.894
You think you might
have live through it?


715
01:00:24.927 --> 01:00:27.597
(chuckling)

716
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:31.400
Oh, you heard about this
happening to other people?


717
01:00:31.433 --> 01:00:34.270
But you ain't never thought
it could happen to you.


718
01:00:35.938 --> 01:00:38.941
- [Sarah] Why are
you doing this?


719
01:00:39.675 --> 01:00:40.876
- Oh god.

720
01:00:40.909 --> 01:00:42.578
That's what you're going with?

721
01:00:42.611 --> 01:00:44.046
The reason?

722
01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.482
Well, everybody's always
looking for the reason.


723
01:00:47.917 --> 01:00:51.754
Oh, there must be some reason
you're doing all of this.


724
01:00:52.989 --> 01:00:53.990
Well, sometimes

725
01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:56.425
there ain't no reason.

726
01:00:58.294 --> 01:00:59.262
Sometimes

727
01:01:02.031 --> 01:01:03.666
evil just is.

728
01:01:03.699 --> 01:01:06.269
(dark music)

729
01:01:07.302 --> 01:01:10.306
(Sarah screaming)

730
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:23.553
(tense music)

731
01:01:29.958 --> 01:01:35.198
(frogs croaking)
(insects thrumming)


732
01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.203
(uneasy music)

733
01:01:55.984 --> 01:01:56.886
- Shit.

734
01:01:58.153 --> 01:02:01.691
(uneasy music continues)

735
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:36.425
- What are you doing?

736
01:02:36.459 --> 01:02:38.294
- Setting the stage.

737
01:02:46.235 --> 01:02:48.037
Now I gotta ask,

738
01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:49.838
you cute little ransom,

739
01:02:49.872 --> 01:02:50.806
what's her name?

740
01:02:52.941 --> 01:02:55.110
- What have you done with her?

741
01:02:55.144 --> 01:02:58.380
- Last thing you ought to
be worried about, loverboy.


742
01:02:58.414 --> 01:03:01.450
I asked the name earlier,
but she didn't say it.


743
01:03:01.483 --> 01:03:03.419
- If she didn't
you, why would I?


744
01:03:06.088 --> 01:03:09.392
- 'Cause I'll cut your
fucking dick off if you don't.


745
01:03:12.261 --> 01:03:14.163
Now I'd ask your cousin,

746
01:03:15.564 --> 01:03:18.066
but the last time we had a
conversation about your rans,


747
01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.803
she tried to make a deal
and fuck off outta here.


748
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:23.406
She didn't mention taking you

749
01:03:23.439 --> 01:03:24.840
until I brought it up.

750
01:03:26.108 --> 01:03:27.576
Your decision, of course.

751
01:03:27.609 --> 01:03:28.744
But if I was you,

752
01:03:29.945 --> 01:03:31.347
I wouldn't trust
that little minx.


753
01:03:32.548 --> 01:03:33.482
- Where is she?

754
01:03:34.983 --> 01:03:38.020
- Oh, she's hanging
around here somewhere.


755
01:03:38.854 --> 01:03:42.057
(uneasy music)

756
01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:42.992
- Sarah.

757
01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.861
Sarah.

758
01:03:47.262 --> 01:03:48.164
Sarah!

759
01:04:02.511 --> 01:04:05.147
- Now she's all but
dead, little man.


760
01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:07.115
I wouldn't pity her though.

761
01:04:07.148 --> 01:04:08.951
Compared to what you got coming,

762
01:04:09.985 --> 01:04:11.287
she's getting off easy.

763
01:04:13.622 --> 01:04:15.090
Crusher,

764
01:04:15.123 --> 01:04:17.493
go get this boy
something to bit down on.


765
01:04:20.663 --> 01:04:22.397
He's gonna need it.

766
01:04:22.431 --> 01:04:25.134
(uneasy music)

767
01:04:43.151 --> 01:04:44.487
See me,

768
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.655
I don't mind the
yells and screams.


769
01:04:46.688 --> 01:04:48.557
Crusher there ain't big on 'em,

770
01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:50.992
and he has a tendency
to shut people up


771
01:04:51.026 --> 01:04:53.629
by turning their heads
into smashed tomatoes.


772
01:04:53.662 --> 01:04:56.499
So you might want to keep
the volume to a minimum.


773
01:04:57.366 --> 01:04:59.568
I'd ask him to leave but,

774
01:04:59.601 --> 01:05:01.170
but he likes to watch.

775
01:05:02.871 --> 01:05:05.140
Now boy, if it's any
consolation to you,


776
01:05:05.173 --> 01:05:06.509
even if you told me your name,

777
01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:08.244
I'd still be cutting
your dick off.


778
01:05:09.244 --> 01:05:12.848
(uneasy music continues)

779
01:05:39.874 --> 01:05:41.009
Probably right right about now,

780
01:05:41.043 --> 01:05:42.377
you're wishing you'd made

781
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:43.712
some different
choices in life, huh?


782
01:05:45.747 --> 01:05:48.784
Now where's that
little pecker of yours?


783
01:05:50.419 --> 01:05:53.956
(uneasy music continues)

784
01:06:03.799 --> 01:06:06.802
Must be hiding in
here somewhere.


785
01:06:08.471 --> 01:06:10.739
Oh, there we go.

786
01:06:17.078 --> 01:06:19.715
I'm thinking we should go
with something little more


787
01:06:19.748 --> 01:06:20.716
elegant.

788
01:06:20.749 --> 01:06:24.253
(uneasy music continues)

789
01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:37.099
Well this one feels right.

790
01:06:37.132 --> 01:06:38.767
Wouldn't you say?

791
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.803
I mean, I'm no surgeon

792
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:44.406
but I'm going with this one.

793
01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.042
(tense music)

794
01:06:49.678 --> 01:06:50.713
Here we go.

795
01:06:56.151 --> 01:06:59.021
(Josh screaming)

796
01:07:02.624 --> 01:07:06.162
(uneasy music continues)

797
01:07:13.669 --> 01:07:17.406
(Josh continues screaming)

798
01:07:36.191 --> 01:07:38.427
Well that wasn't so bad was it?

799
01:07:40.896 --> 01:07:41.997
On to the balls!

800
01:07:44.199 --> 01:07:49.405
(uneasy music continues)
(Josh screaming)


801
01:07:58.347 --> 01:08:01.350
Well, I am impressed, boy.

802
01:08:01.383 --> 01:08:03.852
Most guys would've
passed out by now.


803
01:08:03.886 --> 01:08:06.222
Maybe you ain't such
a Nancy after all.


804
01:08:08.524 --> 01:08:09.691
Nah,

805
01:08:09.724 --> 01:08:10.626
you are.

806
01:08:11.727 --> 01:08:13.796
One down and one to go.

807
01:08:24.907 --> 01:08:27.776
(Josh screaming)

808
01:08:37.452 --> 01:08:39.588
(gun cocks)

809
01:08:39.621 --> 01:08:40.756
Almost done.

810
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:43.392
You are doing great.

811
01:08:45.661 --> 01:08:50.899
(uneasy music)
(Josh screaming)


812
01:09:02.778 --> 01:09:03.679
Now.

813
01:09:07.015 --> 01:09:09.818
We can't have you die
from blood loss can we?


814
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.756
(tense music)

815
01:09:18.594 --> 01:09:21.463
(Josh screaming)

816
01:09:23.498 --> 01:09:27.002
(tense music continues)

817
01:09:55.564 --> 01:09:56.632
Well done.

818
01:09:56.665 --> 01:10:00.169
(tense music continues)

819
01:10:09.044 --> 01:10:11.914
(gun shot fires)

820
01:10:21.123 --> 01:10:22.057
- Let him go.

821
01:10:24.993 --> 01:10:25.894
Now.

822
01:11:02.397 --> 01:11:05.067
(uneasy music)

823
01:11:18.213 --> 01:11:19.882
- [Josh] Fucking kill him.

824
01:11:19.915 --> 01:11:22.050
- Take those shackles,

825
01:11:22.084 --> 01:11:24.052
put them on him.

826
01:11:24.085 --> 01:11:26.088
He's gonna show us
how to get back.


827
01:11:28.589 --> 01:11:30.725
- I know how to get back, just

828
01:11:30.758 --> 01:11:32.260
fucking kill him.

829
01:11:32.294 --> 01:11:33.862
- I'll kill him

830
01:11:33.896 --> 01:11:34.930
as I have to.

831
01:11:38.066 --> 01:11:40.769
(uneasy music)

832
01:11:52.814 --> 01:11:54.850
- Ain't you a piece of work?

833
01:11:54.883 --> 01:11:57.419
This poor creature you
kidnapped and treated like trash


834
01:11:57.452 --> 01:11:59.087
just saved your hide.

835
01:11:59.121 --> 01:12:01.990
And you ain't even got
the manners to thank her.


836
01:12:02.024 --> 01:12:04.626
(tense music)

837
01:12:21.843 --> 01:12:22.811
- Thank you.

838
01:12:26.848 --> 01:12:27.983
Where's my cousin?

839
01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:31.085
- She's strung up side.

840
01:12:31.119 --> 01:12:32.387
- Is she dead?

841
01:12:33.488 --> 01:12:34.890
- Who fucking cares?

842
01:12:34.923 --> 01:12:37.226
- Like I told you,
she ain't dead.


843
01:12:38.626 --> 01:12:40.696
I don't kill no one
unless I have to neither.


844
01:12:41.463 --> 01:12:43.031
- All right, smart ass,

845
01:12:44.399 --> 01:12:45.334
move.

846
01:12:49.137 --> 01:12:50.038
You too.

847
01:12:52.807 --> 01:12:54.142
- I'm getting my cousin.

848
01:12:55.343 --> 01:12:56.311
- Whatever.

849
01:12:57.145 --> 01:12:58.046
Just go.

850
01:13:00.515 --> 01:13:03.185
(uneasy music)

851
01:13:32.213 --> 01:13:33.215
- It is that way.

852
01:13:34.115 --> 01:13:35.517
Get going.

853
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:38.587
- Nah, I ain't doing
nothing of the sort.


854
01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.154
If you won't kill me,

855
01:13:40.188 --> 01:13:43.392
I'm gonna make you do it
right here, right now.


856
01:13:43.425 --> 01:13:45.860
You only got one
shot in that gun.


857
01:13:45.894 --> 01:13:48.229
That means after you
pull the trigger,


858
01:13:48.263 --> 01:13:50.299
maybe take me down.

859
01:13:50.332 --> 01:13:52.333
You ain't got
nothing between you


860
01:13:52.366 --> 01:13:54.102
and your kidnappers right there.

861
01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:57.672
Cat's outta the bag now.

862
01:13:57.706 --> 01:13:59.708
And they know if you live

863
01:13:59.741 --> 01:14:01.175
they're done for,

864
01:14:01.209 --> 01:14:03.779
which means it's going
to be you against them.


865
01:14:04.912 --> 01:14:07.048
And without no ammo
in your pocket,


866
01:14:07.081 --> 01:14:09.952
you ain't got nothing
between them and the horizon.


867
01:14:19.428 --> 01:14:20.395
- Keep moving.

868
01:14:24.399 --> 01:14:27.102
(uneasy music)

869
01:14:31.439 --> 01:14:32.607
Come on.

870
01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.244
(uneasy music continues)

871
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.200

01:16:12.541 --> 01:16:14.009
- I told you I ain't going
down without a fight.


881
01:16:14.042 --> 01:16:15.143
You want me,

882
01:16:15.176 --> 01:16:16.611
you best take me down quick

883
01:16:16.644 --> 01:16:17.645
'fore I kill this
little shitbag.


884
01:16:17.678 --> 01:16:18.880
- Shoot him.

885
01:16:19.948 --> 01:16:20.882
- Do it.

886
01:16:21.716 --> 01:16:22.717
Just shoot him.

887
01:16:22.751 --> 01:16:24.085
- Oh boy.

888
01:16:24.119 --> 01:16:25.554
Will you shut the hell up?
- No.


889
01:16:29.391 --> 01:16:31.325
- Fucking kill him.

890
01:16:31.359 --> 01:16:32.393
(Clyde laughing)

891
01:16:32.427 --> 01:16:33.828
- Yeah, come on.

892
01:16:33.861 --> 01:16:34.729
Do it.

893
01:16:34.762 --> 01:16:35.830
You fucking pansy.

894
01:16:35.864 --> 01:16:36.765
Shoot me down.

895
01:16:36.798 --> 01:16:37.865
Cold blood.

896
01:16:37.899 --> 01:16:39.233
Fuckin' do it.

897
01:16:39.267 --> 01:16:40.535
- Fucking kill him!

898
01:16:42.404 --> 01:16:43.871
- What's the matter, girl?

899
01:16:43.905 --> 01:16:46.207
Ain't you never looked
the devil in the eye?


900
01:16:46.241 --> 01:16:48.076
- Fucking kill him!

901
01:16:48.109 --> 01:16:51.346
- Shoot me!

902
01:16:51.379 --> 01:16:52.580
Do it.

903
01:16:52.614 --> 01:16:55.183
(tense music)

904
01:16:55.216 --> 01:16:57.118
- Give me that fucking thing.

905
01:16:57.152 --> 01:16:58.720
(gun shot fires)

906
01:16:58.753 --> 01:17:00.655
Jesus fucking Christ.

907
01:17:03.491 --> 01:17:04.559
I'm getting

908
01:17:05.493 --> 01:17:06.561
that money.

909
01:17:07.896 --> 01:17:08.797
Go.

910
01:17:11.833 --> 01:17:13.367
I am getting

911
01:17:13.401 --> 01:17:15.970
that fucking money, bitch!

912
01:17:16.004 --> 01:17:19.540
(gun shot fires)

913
01:17:19.574 --> 01:17:22.177
(tense music)

914
01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.329
- You the one they kidnapped?

915
01:17:43.498 --> 01:17:44.800
Where's the other one?

916
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.468
- [Ashley] He's dead.

917
01:17:47.502 --> 01:17:48.637
- Where is he?

918
01:17:49.804 --> 01:17:51.439
- [Ashley] He's
back at their shack.


919
01:17:53.408 --> 01:17:54.342
- Show me.

920
01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:57.045
- Can I just go home?

921
01:17:59.147 --> 01:18:01.516
- I'll get you there,
don't you worry.


922
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:05.654
But you need to show me
what's been happening here.


923
01:18:06.654 --> 01:18:07.521
Alright?

924
01:18:07.555 --> 01:18:09.457
This is a right mess

925
01:18:09.490 --> 01:18:11.193
and I'm fixing to clean it up.

926
01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.598
Now I know you've been through
a bit of an ordeal here,


927
01:18:16.631 --> 01:18:18.633
but you're safe
now you understand?


928
01:18:18.666 --> 01:18:20.135
- Let me go home,

929
01:18:21.402 --> 01:18:22.337
please.

930
01:18:23.504 --> 01:18:26.207
- Soon as you show me
what I need to see,


931
01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.976
I'll do precisely that.

932
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:30.311
You have my word.

933
01:18:30.345 --> 01:18:31.712
All right?

934
01:18:31.746 --> 01:18:33.147
Now,

935
01:18:33.181 --> 01:18:34.149
let's go.

936
01:18:37.185 --> 01:18:38.587
It's not a request.

937
01:18:43.925 --> 01:18:46.661
(uneasy music)

938
01:19:10.051 --> 01:19:11.352
Go on.

939
01:19:11.385 --> 01:19:14.321
- [Ashley] You don't
need me to go in there.


940
01:19:14.355 --> 01:19:16.557
- You're staying with me.

941
01:19:16.591 --> 01:19:17.559
Now go on.

942
01:19:18.426 --> 01:19:22.030
(uneasy music continues)

943
01:19:43.084 --> 01:19:44.286
- He's through there.

944
01:19:45.052 --> 01:19:48.623
(uneasy music continues)

945
01:20:00.635 --> 01:20:03.805
(suspenseful music)

946
01:20:05.106 --> 01:20:06.841
He's gonna kill us.

947
01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:07.775
- Whoa, whoa.

948
01:20:07.809 --> 01:20:08.910
Where you going?

949
01:20:08.943 --> 01:20:10.244
- He's gonna kill us.

950
01:20:10.278 --> 01:20:11.245
He's gonna kill us.

951
01:20:11.279 --> 01:20:12.981
- You're gonna wait

952
01:20:14.015 --> 01:20:15.283
right here

953
01:20:17.085 --> 01:20:20.121
until I get to the
bottom of this.


954
01:20:21.755 --> 01:20:23.958
- You're at the bottom of this.

955
01:20:23.991 --> 01:20:26.927
(uneasy music continues)

956
01:20:26.961 --> 01:20:27.996
They're psychos.

957
01:20:28.029 --> 01:20:31.633
(uneasy music continues)

958
01:20:47.849 --> 01:20:49.851

(uneasy music continues)

960
01:21:11.072 --> 01:21:13.708
(tense music)

961

(blood squishing)

962
01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:27.822
(tense music)

963
01:21:47.942 --> 01:21:49.543
- [Crusher] You're mine.

964
01:21:49.577 --> 01:21:52.280
(uneasy music)

965
01:22:07.429 --> 01:22:10.065
(tense music)

966
01:22:47.435 --> 01:22:50.271
- You fucking little cunt!

967
01:22:50.305 --> 01:22:53.174
(gun shot fires)

968
01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:04.152
Crusher!

969
01:23:09.491 --> 01:23:12.127
(tense music)

970
01:23:14.095 --> 01:23:16.931

(tense music continues)

974
01:24:44.184 --> 01:24:46.721
(soft music)

975
01:25:31.632 --> 01:25:34.736
(cicadas whirring)

976
01:25:45.146 --> 01:25:47.849
(sombre music)
