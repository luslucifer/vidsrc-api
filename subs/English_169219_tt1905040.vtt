00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.004
Devils Pass 2013

2
00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:08.290
These are the facts :

3
00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:24.541
In February 1959, nine hikers
Russians traveled to the Urals .


4
00:01:25.797 --> 00:01:31.647
Two weeks later,
All were found dead .


5
00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:39.048
The fact became known as the
Step Dyatlov incident .


6
00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:46.449
- OK , I'm recording .
- My name is Holly King .


7
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:50.146
I am a student of psychology at the
University of Oregon.


8
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:54.667
In 2008 I saw a bulletin newspaper
about 30 elite scientists


9
00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:59.192
who gathered in a remote area
of the Ural Mountains in Russia .


10
00:01:59.213 --> 00:02:04.111
They were trying to solve a mystery that had
puzzled the world for nearly 50 years .


11
00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:07.273
He was known as
" The Dyatlov Pass Incident "


12
00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:12.068
by the leader of the expedition

13
00:02:12.084 --> 00:02:13.274
They were unsuccessful ,

14
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:15.307
but was intrigued
its history .


15
00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:18.551
So when my favorite teacher ,
Dr. Kittles , instructed our class


16
00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:22.215
a project on that incident in
particularly , I could not believe it.


17
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.865
I mentioned it to a friend of mine , Jenson ,
a film student here,


18
00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:28.924
and he said we should
make a movie.


19
00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:32.141
Then , request a
grant, and ...


20
00:02:32.176 --> 00:02:33.770
Got it ...!

21
00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:36.105
OK , then ...

22
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.889
tell us what happened.

23
00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:42.155
I first heard about this incident
when a Russian journalist Yuri Yarovoi ,


24
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.409
published a fictionalized version
of it in a book.


25
00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:47.798
"From Highest Level of Complexity
by Yuri Yarovoi . "


26
00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:49.997
Of course , he was sent to kill.

27
00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:54.022
" The Russian writer Yuri crashed Yarovoi
on an empty street on January 28, 1980 . "


28
00:02:54.038 --> 00:02:56.388
That is, no matter
it would fictionalized .


29
00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:59.940
Do not want anyone
Dyatlov spoke .


30
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.033
And I started to use the facts of the incident
as exercises in psychology class


31
00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.804
because there is so much to know
happened in the Dyatlov Pass ,


32
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.480
many details ...

33
00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:12.610
and yet , the whole thing
remains shrouded in mystery.


34
00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:15.431
What are the explanations that
heard more often ?


35
00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:18.551
The most common explanations
termed " scientific "


36
00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:22.389
is a condition called
hypothermic dementia ...


37
00:03:22.414 --> 00:03:23.909
Dementia hypothermic

38
00:03:23.944 --> 00:03:26.767
yes, that 's what it says
around the world , literally.


39
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.073
But my favorite ...

40
00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.606
... is called ...

41
00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.765
" desabrigo paradoxical " .

42
00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:41.050
Become disoriented , think they have much
warmth and begin to undress.


43
00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:45.404
-Holly! There were nine experienced backpackers
- Yes


44
00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.233
Are you telling me all suffered
severe hypothermia ...


45
00:03:49.256 --> 00:03:53.559
... at the same time, the same night?
- Could be.


46
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:57.634
They had been out for three days.
Why then?


47
00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.612
An avalanche is another common response .

48
00:04:01.628 --> 00:04:03.728
That's even more stupid ...

49
00:04:03.763 --> 00:04:05.839
... that " desabrigo paradoxical " .
- Why?


50
00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:10.904
If you heard an avalanche , why is
away from the camp for three hours without boots?


51
00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.874
But in reality , there are countless
answers to the question ,


52
00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.418
most of my students screened
their own fears in it ,


53
00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:19.539
Is the Russian army ?

54
00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:22.633
I hope my students proposed more
that a credible explanation ...


55
00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:26.446
I want to get in the
Instead of these people ,


56
00:04:26.453 --> 00:04:31.104
so can understand why
victims did what they did .


57
00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.607
That's the answer I'm looking for.

58
00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:35.226
Are we going to find the truth ?

59
00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:40.513
- Although they are not going to find.
- What do you mean ?


60
00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:43.021
There is no truth .

61
00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:51.355
The first part of our journey takes us
Eugene , Oregon , in Chelyabinsk , Russia.


62
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.006
You will not use that stupid red dotted line
to show our journey is not it?


63
00:04:56.034 --> 00:04:57.641
Error!

64
00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:01.790
Our final destination is the Kholat Syakhl ,

65
00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:05.985
literally translated as
" The Mountain of the Dead " .


66
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.149
Really.

67
00:05:08.184 --> 00:05:12.504
It is the name Mansi tribe gave due
to the many mysterious deaths


68
00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.034
and disappearances along
history. So ...


69
00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:20.639
... find an engineer
Audio , Denise Evers .


70
00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:26.126
It was the only audio operator on campus
that meet the requirements ... physical .


71
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:29.345
There are plenty of lean subjects
devoted to audio.


72
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.397
Huh? What 's wrong with lean subjects ?

73
00:05:32.412 --> 00:05:34.578
Oh , sorry ! My mistake .

74
00:05:34.602 --> 00:05:37.384
And then we find
two guides capable.


75
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.079
I'm Andy Thatcher , president of the
Northwest Association Excursions ...


76
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.524
I climbed mountains almost all U.S. ,
also toured the SA


77
00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:48.322
- Sorry, what?
- The Appalachian Trail .


78
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.530
It stretches from Maine to Georgia,
took me all summer.


79
00:05:51.565 --> 00:05:55.321
- So you think you are qualified for this
- Yes


80
00:05:55.343 --> 00:05:57.269
Why do you want to
do this , Andy ?

81
00:05:57.288 --> 00:06:02.450
As I said , as I climbed all scalable in the U.S.,
's time for a new challenge.


82
00:06:02.466 --> 00:06:05.229
- Are you afraid ?
- No


83
00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:08.776
Really? You know, we're recreating
a trip that killed 9 people .


84
00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:12.555
Yes , 50 years ago . Come on! Not even if
the Abominable Snowman ...


85
00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:14.764
-" Yeti " !
- He is dead .


86
00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:17.610
- And you are ... ?
- He is JP Hauser .


87
00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:18.865
- JP .
- That's right.


88
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.004
And you think you're ready for this?

89
00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.887
Amiga, spent a year
in the Himalayas. He's ready.

90
00:06:23.903 --> 00:06:25.297
- Really?
- Yes


91
00:06:25.313 --> 00:06:29.032
- I took a little time .
- Enough time .


92
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.623
How .. " Hauser "?
How to " Hauser Hall "?


93
00:06:34.658 --> 00:06:38.097
As the building we have right in front

94
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.944
The same .

95
00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.299
That reminds me I have to go to Philosophy .
See you later.


96
00:06:44.773 --> 00:06:47.912
Now that we had our team
was time to work .


97
00:06:47.927 --> 00:06:52.948
We study the maps, prepare the equipment ,
together rations , supplies ...


98
00:06:52.972 --> 00:06:55.511
and then trained on
mountains in the area.


99
00:06:55.546 --> 00:06:59.786
We were encouraged
and eager to leave.


100
00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:04.565
- I hate these damn snowshoeing.
- You look so great with them , Jenson .


101
00:07:04.954 --> 00:07:08.060
Hey ! I can wait a little !

102
00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:14.343
Almost as much as I hate him .

103
00:07:15.383 --> 00:07:17.199
Shit !

104
00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:20.661
And now , January 25 ...

105
00:07:22.248 --> 00:07:23.693
... is time to leave.

106
00:07:23.894 --> 00:07:28.387
The search for five students
Oregon missing last month


107
00:07:28.402 --> 00:07:30.289
in the Ural Mountains .

108
00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:34.640
Remember that three days before the
Rescuers found items


109
00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:39.438
apparently belonged to students,
as tents, backpacks and other equipment .


110
00:07:39.473 --> 00:07:45.016
Our Russian correspondent , Ivan Kudryavtsev , the
Russia 24 news channel , has more details .


111
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:50.324
Good afternoon, Ivan Kudryavtsev and
you are watching channel Russia 24 .


112
00:07:50.355 --> 00:07:55.269
Continue covering the event that captures
the international media attention


113
00:07:55.293 --> 00:07:57.802
and is the country
's most talked news .

114
00:07:57.817 --> 00:08:02.913
The mysterious disappearance of a group of
American documentary in the Urals


115
00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:07.403
which , as you may know , followed the
steps of issuing Igor Dyatlov ,


116
00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:14.130
whose nine members were killed in
mysterious circumstances in 1959 .


117
00:08:14.157 --> 00:08:18.077
The experts handle various theories
to explain the disappearances.


118
00:08:18.278 --> 00:08:23.183
The weather here can be dangerous , the temperature
can drop to -50 ° and winds are brutal .


119
00:08:23.184 --> 00:08:25.234
Wind can change
direction in an instant.


120
00:08:25.235 --> 00:08:28.674
At the top the wind blows towards the
west and a little further down east.


121
00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:32.650
So when someone goes up the mountain and
believes that it is moving in a straight line


122
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:35.021
actually go completely in the other direction .

123
00:08:35.022 --> 00:08:39.472
We do not know how prepared they are for
climatic conditions of northern Russia .


124
00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:44.579
I think they made contact with aliens
a ship or something ...


125
00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:50.943
There have been many curious events
area in recent years .


126
00:08:50.956 --> 00:08:54.619
The more I study the site, meeting
more mysterious signals ...


127
00:08:54.631 --> 00:08:56.933
... and sinister , even mystical .

128
00:08:56.949 --> 00:09:03.043
There are so many unexplained mysteries in that area
feed such theories , even the mystical ...


129
00:09:03.078 --> 00:09:09.138
are understandable as long there are stories
objects that bear witness in heaven,


130
00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:14.731
and to this day there are common
the stories of the yeti footprints .


131
00:09:14.746 --> 00:09:19.233
Also a native tribe in the area,
Mansi , have their own theory.


132
00:09:19.251 --> 00:09:23.524
Mansi Elders recall that when
Dyatlov group disappeared ,


133
00:09:23.537 --> 00:09:27.381
There were loud noises and strange unexplained
fireballs over the mountains


134
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.500
We believe that in that place ...

135
00:09:31.535 --> 00:09:34.723
... two worlds collide.

136
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.126
You can move from one
world to the other ...

137
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.101
That's where you enter
the world of spirits .

138
00:09:46.136 --> 00:09:49.344
Russia Channel 24 will continue to report

139
00:09:49.352 --> 00:09:53.094
on recent disappearances
north of the Urals


140
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:58.128
with 5 U.S. hikers
mysteriously vanished


141
00:09:58.142 --> 00:10:03.226
in the same place where, in 1959 , the group
Igor Dyatlov met his death .


142
00:10:08.359 --> 00:10:10.146
Thank you, Ivan.

143
00:10:10.181 --> 00:10:15.404
Students were recreating the failed
journey undertaken by Igor Dyatlov


144
00:10:15.426 --> 00:10:19.383
and 8 other hikers Russians 50
years ago for a documentary .


145
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:23.195
The track was found most promising
a camera recording equipment .


146
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:27.300
They studied the recordings without
make them known to the public, but today,


147
00:10:27.324 --> 00:10:32.160
a group of hackers calling itself conspires - Leaks
had access to recordings


148
00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:34.289
and rose to their internet site .

149
00:10:34.328 --> 00:10:38.582
I opened the door and darkness followed me ,
like my dream


150
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.125
Hey , come on.
Hey , hey, hey .


151
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.271
- It was a dream , just a dream ...
- Forgive .


152
00:10:44.285 --> 00:10:47.578
Jenson ,never get out of here!

153
00:10:48.993 --> 00:10:51.063
Forgive me ...

154
00:11:01.742 --> 00:11:03.949
A month before .

155
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:11.411
We landed in Russia and the next part
Our journey takes us from Chelyabinsk


156
00:11:11.425 --> 00:11:14.574
to the Ural Mountains to a
town called Ivdel .


157
00:11:14.584 --> 00:11:19.481
Cute tattoo, you got the other wing , or just one?
- Only one, and it hurt like shit.


158
00:11:19.499 --> 00:11:23.190
Surely . Do you have any other,
something you want to show on camera ?


159
00:11:23.225 --> 00:11:25.804
In your dreams , pervert. 
And that phone ?

160
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:31.018
GPS is equipped with a universal ,
when no cell signal ,


161
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.380
GPS navigation anywhere in the world .

162
00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:36.190
Genial!

163
00:11:36.219 --> 00:11:40.546
I'm sorry , I can not help
know I did not bring the fluid .


164
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:43.971
- Do not do that .
- Do you talk to the camera?


165
00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:46.668
I talk to Lucile .

166
00:11:46.688 --> 00:11:48.266
Do you talk like a girl ?

167
00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:51.431
The types of film are
very attached to their cameras.


168
00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:54.319
Do not listen , baby ,
are jealous .


169
00:11:54.329 --> 00:11:57.368
- Thank you.
- Very attached ...


170
00:11:57.396 --> 00:11:58.946
Thank you.

171
00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:09.697
What is it that makes backpacks hang
and spend a week out there?


172
00:12:11.232 --> 00:12:14.223
It's a test , you know?
Man against nature.


173
00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:17.433
People have survived millennia
without all these devices ,


174
00:12:17.457 --> 00:12:20.582
And if we have to make do without them
you can bet your ass we will.


175
00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:22.359
You are extremely confident .

176
00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:26.232
If you get into this
without trust , not back .


177
00:12:27.749 --> 00:12:29.494
And you, JP ?

178
00:12:31.888 --> 00:12:34.773
Well, I thought, "
is a unique opportunity ."

179
00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:38.183
I want to see and do
as possible,


180
00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:41.099
I have everything I need
in that bag for months ...


181
00:12:41.123 --> 00:12:44.156
- That ?
- For years , maybe. Yes, that .


182
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.562
How many people can say that?

183
00:12:46.582 --> 00:12:49.233
I hope you do not have to
survive for so long.


184
00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:53.605
- Well , you never know .
- You never know .


185
00:13:31.866 --> 00:13:36.034
We spent a day in Ivdel ,
Piotr to interview Karov ,


186
00:13:36.074 --> 00:13:41.786
It was the tenth member of the Dyatlov
I got sick the first day and had to return .


187
00:13:41.812 --> 00:13:47.392
Not long had a nervous breakdown and has been
in this psychiatric hospital since.


188
00:13:50.557 --> 00:13:53.145
For back .
Turn off the camera!


189
00:13:53.185 --> 00:13:55.086
Hey, hey ,
Do not touch the camera !


190
00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:56.694
Turn it off !

191
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.680
-No recordings !
-I want you to tell the camera!


192
00:13:59.697 --> 00:14:03.485
-Must leave now , please!
- The Cold War ended , we're friends now .


193
00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:05.732
Why can not
Piotr Karov interview ?


194
00:14:05.754 --> 00:14:08.079
- Died . Now beat it .
- What?


195
00:14:08.088 --> 00:14:11.076
- How did he die ?
-Long !


196
00:14:12.287 --> 00:14:15.344
- Friendly , right?
-Holly, the upstairs window !


197
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:18.230
What? Is it?

198
00:14:20.038 --> 00:14:23.749
-I do not understand !
-Oh ! Did you see that ?


199
00:14:23.776 --> 00:14:26.500
Was it for us ? 
What did it say ?

200
00:14:26.534 --> 00:14:29.703
- You see that , right?
- What the fuck ... ?


201
00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:42.228
I know I sound like Jenson , but I
that the window was Piotr Karov ,


202
00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:45.156
And I have really wanted to know what
read the sign that showed


203
00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:48.178
But as we can see ,
and no trains arrive here ,


204
00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:52.198
ask someone to take us to Vizhaj ,
where we will begin our tour.


205
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.985
Not think we should send Jenson as
Ambassador , could restart the Cold War.


206
00:14:57.004 --> 00:15:00.356
OK , these guys
say here's a local bar

207
00:15:00.357 --> 00:15:04.675
we should visit , because some of the
Parishioners have relatives in Vizhaj ,


208
00:15:04.699 --> 00:15:07.519
So we could get a ride.
Is that OK ?


209
00:15:07.548 --> 00:15:11.559
- Come on.
- A bar sounds good to me .


210
00:15:11.607 --> 00:15:14.816
-'re Wrong way !
-No, we should go this way !


211
00:15:15.601 --> 00:15:19.033
That's what I said !
Jenson 1 Andy 0 .


212
00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:21.800
Look, you can enter with dogs,
so do not come home alone.


213
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:23.443
- That's funny.
-Calm down !


214
00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:26.210
Holly , you know why no
drunk driving in Russia ?


215
00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:29.101
- No. -Ta -da!
-Hey ! Let's get a picture! Come on!


216
00:15:29.117 --> 00:15:31.918
-Yes !
- I have the timer on my camera.


217
00:15:32.947 --> 00:15:35.984
Only available on the iPhone 3 .

218
00:15:35.997 --> 00:15:37.508
Come on .

219
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:41.247
- One .. -Smile ! - Two ... - Three ...
-West Coast !


220
00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:53.081
Do you speak English ?

221
00:15:53.591 --> 00:15:55.256
Sure.

222
00:15:55.274 --> 00:15:57.377
- Anything to drink?
- Yes , please.


223
00:15:57.383 --> 00:15:59.132
Jenson , look for
someone to take us .

224
00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:04.401
We are young attractive in a land
foreign and we would like a drink.


225
00:16:04.415 --> 00:16:06.972
- Where are you going ?
- Vizhaj .


226
00:16:07.882 --> 00:16:10.031
So that drink?

227
00:16:10.039 --> 00:16:11.765
Vizhaj ? ?

228
00:16:11.777 --> 00:16:13.777
What for?

229
00:16:13.798 --> 00:16:18.039
We are making a documentary
about the Dyatlov Pass Incident .


230
00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:19.626
Ah ...

231
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.640
Must try this!

232
00:16:26.226 --> 00:16:28.597
- What's there?
- VIP , gentlemen.


233
00:16:28.632 --> 00:16:30.968
-Come that drink !
- Swallow ? Oh , no ...


234
00:16:30.997 --> 00:16:36.262
You are with me , so the treatment
Special . Does anyone have a cigarette ?


235
00:16:36.942 --> 00:16:39.977
Not many around here ...

236
00:16:41.553 --> 00:16:46.125
- Oh ... The Bottle of Death No Label.
- Linda bottle.


237
00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.084
- God, do you smell ?
-Yes !


238
00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:52.759
It sucks ...

239
00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:55.644
- Not so full ...
-Fill It!


240
00:16:57.126 --> 00:16:58.818
Vessels are large !

241
00:17:01.414 --> 00:17:03.145
Let's do it !

242
00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:06.252
- Do the deal?
-Wait, wait!


243
00:17:11.162 --> 00:17:12.871
My God, will be a disaster.

244
00:17:12.872 --> 00:17:15.971
- It's the end ...
- Going to break up with me , bitch .


245
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:20.672
Come to the drink!

246
00:17:21.224 --> 00:17:23.601
For the success of your trip .

247
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:26.306
- Thank you.
- "Na zdorovje "


248
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.423
What?

249
00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:30.974
I mean, I may not know anything about the people,
culture , history or women


250
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.235
Russian , but I did my homework
about good manners .


251
00:17:34.252 --> 00:17:37.172
- So ... Health !
-Health , folks!


252
00:17:44.435 --> 00:17:46.362
What a fucking shit!

253
00:17:46.383 --> 00:17:49.302
What are they? Fags ? ?

254
00:17:49.315 --> 00:17:51.502
What is that ?

255
00:17:51.525 --> 00:17:54.553
- Sa -ma- gon .
- Samagon .


256
00:17:54.583 --> 00:17:57.059
Russian is a homemade liquor .

257
00:17:57.075 --> 00:17:59.267
Yes? Why Samagon served us ?

258
00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:01.865
We serve them from here ...

259
00:18:01.887 --> 00:18:04.540
- ... before they left .
- Who? Who took that?


260
00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:07.764
Dyatlov ! They drank from it before .

261
00:18:17.365 --> 00:18:19.680
Stop. Not funny.

262
00:18:19.704 --> 00:18:23.588
- Not a bad omen , right?
- No, it's just a coincidence.


263
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:26.218
- I think we 're going to order another round , mate.
-Yes !


264
00:18:26.234 --> 00:18:29.919
-Prepare them ! - Are they making a movie ?
- That's right.


265
00:18:29.935 --> 00:18:32.580
- And will Vizhaj , right?
- Yes


266
00:18:32.603 --> 00:18:35.623
Yes , you know
how to get there ?

267
00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:37.957
I will take .

268
00:18:38.429 --> 00:18:39.993
Will you? Very well .

269
00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.855
Leave tomorrow .

270
00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:44.769
- Yes - Yes
- And take us all ?


271
00:18:44.784 --> 00:18:46.356
No problem .

272
00:18:46.372 --> 00:18:48.249
I told them it would work.

273
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.574
OK . Can serve a
drink to this man ?

274
00:18:50.593 --> 00:18:53.339
- A drink . - What are you drinking ?
- Vodka .


275
00:18:53.363 --> 00:18:55.677
Thank you .

276
00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:58.419
No problem. My name is Sergei.

277
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:02.518
See? Not so bad .

278
00:19:04.562 --> 00:19:09.052
- Who put Jenson in charge of transportation ?
- At least we have the girls , brother.


279
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:12.091
- Dream
- How long ?


280
00:19:12.107 --> 00:19:14.706
Why Vizhaj ? Some 65 kms .

281
00:19:14.722 --> 00:19:17.611
'Sixty -five? Perfect .

282
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.899
At least we have enough
potatoes for chewing.


283
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:47.885
-Denise , come on!
-Guys !


284
00:19:48.401 --> 00:19:51.188
My eyes were frozen and do not open.

285
00:19:51.212 --> 00:19:53.210
Not funny. What do I do ?

286
00:19:53.211 --> 00:19:56.345
- Wait, do not move.
- Be gentle with her , Andy .


287
00:19:58.807 --> 00:20:01.446
- Let me
- Shit .


288
00:20:02.102 --> 00:20:04.132
Wait, the other!

289
00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.512
There it is.
Are you okay?


290
00:20:10.582 --> 00:20:12.774
Yes, thank you .

291
00:20:21.899 --> 00:20:24.930
Is it cold in here ? 
I feel that ... are ...

292
00:20:24.947 --> 00:20:27.907
- I feel like ... cold.
-Well , come here !


293
00:20:28.806 --> 00:20:31.274
No, my friend !
That's not right .


294
00:20:31.953 --> 00:20:36.229
- I give you $ 100 if you lick the bumper.
- I'll give you a dollar if you suck at JP .


295
00:20:36.254 --> 00:20:38.279
Come on, guys !

296
00:20:38.593 --> 00:20:42.604
Hey, this is going to love it. it follows that
Sergei is here to visit her aunt .


297
00:20:42.612 --> 00:20:44.234
How exciting !

298
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.245
No. She was part of the first team
rescue at the site Dyatlov .


299
00:20:48.268 --> 00:20:50.588
- Wait, really?
- Yes


300
00:20:50.612 --> 00:20:54.722
- I can ask him to talk with you if you want.
- Yes ,


301
00:20:54.723 --> 00:20:57.578
- I want to.
- I'll be in the movie , right?


302
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.923
-Sure!
- Does she speak English ?


303
00:20:59.941 --> 00:21:01.850
Better than me .

304
00:21:01.873 --> 00:21:04.294
Could you translate for something ?

305
00:21:04.321 --> 00:21:06.892
- Get the camera .
- Yes , of course.


306
00:21:08.213 --> 00:21:10.684
Let 's meet and aunt.

307
00:21:10.704 --> 00:21:13.089
- What do you call it?
- Alya .


308
00:21:13.102 --> 00:21:15.163
It was a school teacher.

309
00:21:18.097 --> 00:21:19.598
What is that ?

310
00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:22.030
What the poster said Piotr showed .

311
00:21:33.857 --> 00:21:35.997
- Like this?
- Yes , I think so.


312
00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:38.596
What does it mean ?

313
00:21:40.534 --> 00:21:42.534
"Go away ! "

314
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.080
Tell us what happened .

315
00:21:47.094 --> 00:21:52.274
My brother , Vallik , Sergei 's father ,
found the first body.


316
00:21:53.627 --> 00:21:56.281
I still remember him shouting

317
00:21:57.241 --> 00:21:59.482
when he returned later.

318
00:22:02.372 --> 00:22:04.403
Proceed .

319
00:22:09.945 --> 00:22:13.831
Did not take long
to find the other bodies

320
00:22:17.054 --> 00:22:19.074
A trail ...

321
00:22:20.404 --> 00:22:22.537
... a trail of bodies ...

322
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.652
Found two ...

323
00:22:27.652 --> 00:22:29.656
... and a woman ...

324
00:22:29.687 --> 00:22:33.408
next to the tree where
they had made a fire .

325
00:22:33.427 --> 00:22:36.367
There are two

326
00:22:36.381 --> 00:22:39.246
and four more in the gorge.

327
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.274
We were sad ,

328
00:22:47.164 --> 00:22:49.264
but not surprised ,

329
00:22:49.867 --> 00:22:51.888
when we discover

330
00:22:52.699 --> 00:22:55.362
there were no survivors .

331
00:22:58.507 --> 00:23:01.953
But the scene was so strange .

332
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.269
I felt ...

333
00:23:06.066 --> 00:23:08.462
that people were nervous .

334
00:23:09.202 --> 00:23:11.206
I also felt ,

335
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.265
that something was wrong with this place .

336
00:23:19.245 --> 00:23:23.683
I went out , I
just wanted to leave that place.

337
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:27.127
That's when I found two more ,

338
00:23:27.815 --> 00:23:29.893
on the north side .

339
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.303
There was something strange about them ,

340
00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:36.511
stranger than the others.

341
00:23:37.639 --> 00:23:39.654
And some ...

342
00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:42.328
... near them , in the snow.

343
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.055
A machine !

344
00:23:49.592 --> 00:23:52.414
- As strange ...
- Excuse me .


345
00:23:52.432 --> 00:23:54.882
Come on ... Let's cut a minute.

346
00:23:54.906 --> 00:23:57.618
Then , they found 11 bodies .

347
00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.719
- Yes
- Are you sure?


348
00:24:03.577 --> 00:24:06.535
I know what I saw , young lady.

349
00:24:08.053 --> 00:24:10.247
I'll never forget .

350
00:24:10.847 --> 00:24:17.285
But the report , the photos of the place ...
Everyone says it was only nine .


351
00:24:17.286 --> 00:24:18.918
So what?

352
00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:24.172
Do you believe what
everyone tells you create ...

353
00:24:24.778 --> 00:24:27.839
... or believes in his own eyes ?

354
00:24:31.227 --> 00:24:33.242
I will leave in the next road.

355
00:24:33.243 --> 00:24:35.538
We do not know how
to thank you , Sergei.

356
00:24:40.287 --> 00:24:42.291
-I told you !
- What do we say?


357
00:24:42.313 --> 00:24:44.663
Aliens ! What else could it be?

358
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:49.344
What about the military ? You yourself said you were
doing an experiment at the time.


359
00:24:49.362 --> 00:24:54.523
- Well , I change my vote to " aliens" .
- Yes, that makes much more sense , Jenson


360
00:24:56.484 --> 00:25:00.573
And you, Andy ? What do you think of the theory
Jenson alien ?


361
00:25:02.076 --> 00:25:05.750
- Stupid .
- Is it pretty solid , eh ?


362
00:25:06.581 --> 00:25:09.696
I do not think Andy
agrees with your theory .

363
00:25:10.573 --> 00:25:12.581
What matters!

364
00:25:12.596 --> 00:25:15.889
Do not you think you shot me enough?
Shoot the mountains.


365
00:25:15.907 --> 00:25:18.478
You are much more interesting , JP .

366
00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:30.964
Andy ! Denise does not remove
eyes off her .


367
00:25:30.995 --> 00:25:35.499
Yeah, it's like saying :Oh , Jesus !

368
00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.625
What an idiot !

369
00:25:41.017 --> 00:25:44.572
So is it as expected ?

370
00:25:44.589 --> 00:25:46.802
- Yes
-Oh , yes !


371
00:25:47.759 --> 00:25:50.219
JP !
Any last words ?


372
00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.740
Is that it ?

373
00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:55.588
- That 's what?
- " Kholat Syakhl "


374
00:25:55.609 --> 00:25:57.613
Yes.

375
00:26:00.845 --> 00:26:02.939
The Mountain of the Dead !

376
00:26:05.173 --> 00:26:06.911
Jesus!

377
00:26:09.707 --> 00:26:13.572
As you can see ,
the weather changes fast,


378
00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:15.617
and changed .

379
00:26:17.105 --> 00:26:19.109
My racquet again!

380
00:26:22.824 --> 00:26:24.593
What a piece of shit!

381
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.296
- I will not die here .
- Better leave before nightfall.


382
00:26:28.321 --> 00:26:30.251
- The climate will change.
-Jenson !


383
00:26:30.275 --> 00:26:33.115
-Yo! -Only one more take !
-Come on !


384
00:26:34.246 --> 00:26:36.313
Friends , this is fantastic .

385
00:26:48.346 --> 00:26:52.636
So, Mr. Hauser , tell
about cooking at camp.


386
00:26:53.682 --> 00:26:58.987
Well, I like to keep it simple
and light as possible . Therefore ...


387
00:27:01.065 --> 00:27:06.088
... I bring you ... Mountain Chili
dehydrated. Delicious .


388
00:27:06.089 --> 00:27:08.494
You know I'm vegetarian , right?

389
00:27:08.512 --> 00:27:10.690
- Really?
- Yes


390
00:27:11.413 --> 00:27:15.303
- I do not know ... have macaroni and cheese , huh ?
-Mmm !


391
00:27:17.699 --> 00:27:20.420
Right. So what we do is boil water.

392
00:27:20.436 --> 00:27:22.181
You are using snow , right?

393
00:27:22.196 --> 00:27:27.053
Yes We need to conserve fresh water . but
do not worry : the boiling kills bacteria.


394
00:27:27.054 --> 00:27:30.207
- This smells amazing .
- JP , you're a master of the kitchen ...


395
00:27:30.208 --> 00:27:32.005
Wait ...so there !

396
00:27:32.443 --> 00:27:34.212
... you burn your mouth.

397
00:27:36.626 --> 00:27:37.959
Idiot !

398
00:27:37.988 --> 00:27:41.168
Why did you give me , if you knew
it was hot ?


399
00:27:42.891 --> 00:27:45.247
- I still do not feel like anything.
- It is true .


400
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.707
-Surprise for everyone!
- What is ?


401
00:27:47.733 --> 00:27:49.131
Chocolate ? ?

402
00:27:50.586 --> 00:27:53.212
- It looks good .
- You had all this time?


403
00:27:55.869 --> 00:27:58.073
I sleep well anywhere.

404
00:27:58.617 --> 00:28:02.123
- I have a surprise for you , Denise.
- Really? What is it?


405
00:28:02.143 --> 00:28:05.651
I carved while cutting firewood.

406
00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:08.264
Thank you. How cute .

407
00:28:08.277 --> 00:28:10.975
- Actual Size.
- What do I do with this?


408
00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:14.009
- I can show you later if you want .
- Surely you can .


409
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.339
How many nights spend with these guys ?

410
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.131
Dos.

411
00:28:25.365 --> 00:28:27.179
Tasty !

412
00:28:27.195 --> 00:28:29.426
How's the pepperoni ?

413
00:28:29.453 --> 00:28:30.852
It's good.

414
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:32.811
- Want some ?
- No, thank you.


415
00:28:33.496 --> 00:28:35.138
Oh , Jenson ,

416
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:37.334
show me your beautiful eyes.

417
00:28:40.445 --> 00:28:42.959
- That is sexy.
- Is it sexy?


418
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.280
What is your first experience
on a professional film ?


419
00:28:47.296 --> 00:28:49.371
Is this a film professional ?

420
00:28:49.387 --> 00:28:52.448
Better than this there is ,
the best of the best.


421
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.219
It's good. How do you get you
with the tour ?


422
00:28:55.229 --> 00:28:58.323
- Well . It is easy ... - Yes ?
- ... In my dreams.


423
00:28:58.347 --> 00:29:01.317
Give me hiking !
Give me mountains!


424
00:29:01.353 --> 00:29:04.345
Hoping you liderases the tour tomorrow.

425
00:29:04.361 --> 00:29:07.213
I think we were better with Andy ...

426
00:29:07.235 --> 00:29:10.705
His confidence convince me.

427
00:29:12.161 --> 00:29:14.818
But you are interested in
other things too , right?

428
00:29:14.835 --> 00:29:16.244
Jesus ...

429
00:29:16.253 --> 00:29:17.978
I did not hear what
you said, and I'm glad ...

430
00:29:17.979 --> 00:29:21.474
- Best you have not heard ...
- It was very funny. - Really?


431
00:29:22.164 --> 00:29:24.033
Is not it beautiful ?

432
00:29:24.048 --> 00:29:25.882
What?

433
00:29:25.906 --> 00:29:27.926
The aurora borealis.

434
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.415
Oh, right .

435
00:29:32.758 --> 00:29:34.765
Yes , very ...

436
00:29:35.439 --> 00:29:37.455
cute .

437
00:29:38.329 --> 00:29:40.925
- How is your tongue ?
- Well .


438
00:29:44.718 --> 00:29:49.882
You know, if you're interested the aurora borealis,
Denise tent is over there


439
00:29:49.906 --> 00:29:54.871
Believe it or not , I'm not spying
Denise at this time.


440
00:29:54.897 --> 00:29:57.204
OK , what are you doing?

441
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.410
In the week before the incident , there
reports of orange lights in the sky .


442
00:30:04.433 --> 00:30:07.073
Six witnesses completely different.

443
00:30:07.089 --> 00:30:10.387
-Aliens !
- I think the majority.


444
00:30:10.413 --> 00:30:15.427
The official response was :
" Unusual atmospheric conditions ."


445
00:30:15.428 --> 00:30:19.877
The moon reflecting off the
clouds , things like that .

446
00:30:20.445 --> 00:30:23.477
- But you do not believe that.
-Hey ! They should go to sleep!


447
00:30:23.478 --> 00:30:25.804
Start early .
Should reach destination tomorrow.


448
00:30:25.828 --> 00:30:27.979
-OK!
- What?


449
00:30:28.833 --> 00:30:30.616
The big day .

450
00:30:30.633 --> 00:30:33.828
Yeah I'll just ... see that.

451
00:30:34.056 --> 00:30:35.826
OK .

452
00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:43.347
What was that ?

453
00:30:43.361 --> 00:30:45.551
What was what ?
That sound !


454
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.655
Forget it.

455
00:30:48.656 --> 00:30:52.271
-Holly! Arise ! - What?
-Something was here ! You gotta see this !


456
00:30:52.272 --> 00:30:54.855
- It's just a joke Jenson .
-Fuck you !


457
00:30:54.856 --> 00:30:57.332
-What the hell ...!
- OK , we're recording .


458
00:30:57.333 --> 00:30:58.955
- Denise ?
- I do not like .


459
00:30:58.966 --> 00:31:01.847
Denise , if something would happen,
have happened last night.


460
00:31:01.882 --> 00:31:03.269
You can not know .

461
00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:07.549
Do not expose to danger . Strange,
but we have to film it , OK?


462
00:31:07.556 --> 00:31:09.584
All right , whatever.

463
00:31:09.596 --> 00:31:11.617
Can you wait a minute?

464
00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:14.795
Thank you !

465
00:31:16.012 --> 00:31:18.017
You're an idiot .

466
00:31:20.147 --> 00:31:23.571
OK . We woke up this morning
and found something strange.


467
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:28.114
Treads between these two rocks
and around the tents .


468
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:31.352
They have a strange way .
Do you see how big is that ?


469
00:31:31.376 --> 00:31:36.723
And the other is even bigger.
Two pairs , two different people.


470
00:31:36.747 --> 00:31:39.569
-Oh ! People?
- I'm not talking about the Yeti , Jenson .


471
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.072
Come on! Look at the size of those footprints !
What else could it be?


472
00:31:42.073 --> 00:31:44.538
I do not know ! 
A bear, a tiger in the snow ...

473
00:31:44.554 --> 00:31:48.873
- What? Snow tiger ? ?
-The Snow Tiger is extinct , brainiac !


474
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.321
What is even more bizarre :

475
00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:53.902
Anyone walking in this type of snow ,
need special boots .


476
00:31:53.903 --> 00:31:57.949
They have to have good grip , so they have to
have soles with nails or well marked channels .


477
00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.825
But these tracks are soft . About
have been , were barefoot .


478
00:32:01.841 --> 00:32:05.058
Andy tells us that , with the low
temperatures there at night,


479
00:32:05.074 --> 00:32:07.774
- ... Fingers freeze them in 10 minutes.
- Which would explain the Yeti .


480
00:32:07.775 --> 00:32:11.171
-It's not the damn Yeti ! - How do you know ?
-Because there are Yetis damn !


481
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.562
-You do not exist !
-By God , Jenson !


482
00:32:13.591 --> 00:32:15.163
OK , let's record .

483
00:32:15.178 --> 00:32:18.655
None of the tracks out
or go to camp.


484
00:32:18.671 --> 00:32:23.126
It is as if something had fallen from the sky , walked
barefoot around us while we slept ,


485
00:32:23.142 --> 00:32:25.195
and then flew off.

486
00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:28.087
- Does the Yeti flies?
- Hello , Mike . - Hello.


487
00:32:28.115 --> 00:32:29.318
Can we pack?

488
00:32:29.346 --> 00:32:32.308
- Here's Tigers snow?
- There is no fucking tiger here .


489
00:32:32.332 --> 00:32:34.011
Ven.

490
00:32:34.021 --> 00:32:36.684
Do not have to cross that, right?

491
00:32:37.296 --> 00:32:38.646
No.

492
00:32:38.662 --> 00:32:42.819
- You all right? They were quiet all morning.
- Yes , we're fine.


493
00:32:42.843 --> 00:32:46.251
- There seem to be fine .
- We do not like that we fuck , that's all .


494
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:48.463
Do they think I'm kidding ?

495
00:32:48.481 --> 00:32:51.682
No, thought Bigfoot was
visiting our camp last night.


496
00:32:51.698 --> 00:32:53.535
How could falsify this?

497
00:32:53.544 --> 00:32:57.758
True, Holly. Nobody ever put
Bigfoot footprints .


498
00:32:59.604 --> 00:33:01.656
He's right, Holly.

499
00:33:01.674 --> 00:33:04.683
It's okay to have fun ,
but look around you .


500
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:07.553
It is the worst place in the world
to scare someone.


501
00:33:07.571 --> 00:33:10.278
Do not know what they are talking about.

502
00:33:12.785 --> 00:33:16.996
We need to say that we
all to limit this morning.


503
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:32.085
Holly!
You hear that?


504
00:33:34.242 --> 00:33:38.529
We are investigating where
came the strange sounds.


505
00:33:38.555 --> 00:33:42.195
We hear the recording but
anyone know what might be ...


506
00:33:42.219 --> 00:33:44.226
... and then find this,

507
00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:48.993
as the traces of the camp,
without beginning or end.


508
00:33:49.014 --> 00:33:50.574
We're a little scared.

509
00:33:50.592 --> 00:33:53.755
Holly! Come see this! More tracks!

510
00:33:56.842 --> 00:33:59.922
- What is that?
- A meteorological tower .


511
00:33:59.946 --> 00:34:04.350
They put them in remote areas like this.
The propeller above the wind speed measured .


512
00:34:04.368 --> 00:34:06.433
It does not work , right?

513
00:34:13.113 --> 00:34:16.343
- Hey , what are you doing?
- Look at the footprints .


514
00:34:16.368 --> 00:34:20.706
Whatever you made that noise ,
is here, and want to know why .


515
00:34:23.492 --> 00:34:25.390
- So?
- Wait .


516
00:34:26.535 --> 00:34:27.550
What the fuck ... ? !

517
00:34:30.974 --> 00:34:32.967
Are you okay?

518
00:34:32.998 --> 00:34:35.092
- Yes
- Are you sure ?


519
00:34:37.201 --> 00:34:38.973
Holly ...

520
00:34:38.996 --> 00:34:41.001
Is one language ?

521
00:34:42.039 --> 00:34:44.850
-This is not safe , Holly !
- Yes , it seemed that.


522
00:34:44.866 --> 00:34:47.931
This is serious ! It is a language !
We should go now!


523
00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:50.425
- Denise , could you ... ?
- And those prints ... ?


524
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.757
- ... and what Jenson says ... ? Listen !
- It may be an animalGive us a minute !


525
00:34:53.777 --> 00:34:55.116
Hey , come on.

526
00:34:55.145 --> 00:34:58.560
Bothering with that
Teen Movie , come on.


527
00:34:58.572 --> 00:35:00.052
- Okay?
- Yes


528
00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.026
Are you okay?

529
00:35:05.049 --> 00:35:07.894
Yeah I'm just a little
scared , that's all .

530
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.261
Well, you know .
Everybody is .


531
00:35:10.262 --> 00:35:13.632
I heard about this
mountain pass , in China,

532
00:35:13.648 --> 00:35:21.131
where birds collide with the walls and
crazy people and animals , and die.


533
00:35:21.159 --> 00:35:25.935
And that's because the wind generates
sound 4 mega Hertz


534
00:35:25.951 --> 00:35:28.792
that makes people go crazy .

535
00:35:28.808 --> 00:35:31.255
- Do not you think ... ?
- The wind is driving us crazy ... ?


536
00:35:31.271 --> 00:35:35.369
No. Jenson , all saw the recording
and we heard that , whatever it was .


537
00:35:36.475 --> 00:35:38.741
Please tell me what's wrong .

538
00:35:40.399 --> 00:35:42.433
I've heard it before .

539
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:44.655
Jesus , Jenson .

540
00:35:48.356 --> 00:35:49.656
I had a ...

541
00:35:52.522 --> 00:35:54.672
I had a very bad trip
when I was in school .


542
00:35:55.113 --> 00:35:58.573
One acid .
Ok , I've never done .


543
00:36:00.874 --> 00:36:06.774
The funny part is that it seems that all
brain cells triggered simultaneously.


544
00:36:07.136 --> 00:36:12.036
For the first time in your life ,
things got a little strange .


545
00:36:12.184 --> 00:36:15.204
and ... I heard .

546
00:36:16.128 --> 00:36:19.528
and I were chasing
and I was running ...


547
00:36:20.497 --> 00:36:23.797
and next thing I know ,
policemen were picking me ,


548
00:36:23.798 --> 00:36:26.398
and was in the middle of the street
screaming about demons.


549
00:36:28.944 --> 00:36:32.184
and ... now I'm here with you.

550
00:36:33.875 --> 00:36:37.275
- And here they are.
- Ok , dear , when I was a kid ...


551
00:36:37.316 --> 00:36:38.906
... had these dreams .

552
00:36:39.007 --> 00:36:43.567
About this place . It was just like ,
mountains , snow , everything.


553
00:36:44.518 --> 00:36:47.818
It is as if this magnet,
drawing me to this.


554
00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:50.859
And out of here and
had this door ...


555
00:36:51.213 --> 00:36:55.593
A door . And I do not open it
but I have to.


556
00:36:55.794 --> 00:36:58.554
And on the other
side there is only darkness.

557
00:36:58.755 --> 00:37:00.635
And this darkness absorbs me .

558
00:37:01.336 --> 00:37:04.256
And I fully awoke screaming ...

559
00:37:04.257 --> 00:37:06.847
and my parents told me I was
having night terrors ,


560
00:37:06.878 --> 00:37:10.438
and took me to a psychiatrist , I
given pills and nothing worked.


561
00:37:10.618 --> 00:37:13.558
All right. Then I saw in the
news about these scientists ,


562
00:37:14.078 --> 00:37:20.308
and ... I knew. I said , that is , is the
place you 've been dreaming of.


563
00:37:20.883 --> 00:37:25.273
So I know that we will have
do what no one else has been .


564
00:37:25.274 --> 00:37:27.574
Let's find out what happened to those people.

565
00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:30.095
All right. we also
should be here .


566
00:37:30.723 --> 00:37:32.633
Right. How crazy about that .

567
00:37:32.883 --> 00:37:36.613
Been spending a lot of time with me .
You're supposed to be our Velma .


568
00:37:36.614 --> 00:37:39.534
- What is that?
- Scooby Doo .


569
00:37:39.592 --> 00:37:43.092
- Does the dog ?
- Yes No, no, Velma ...


570
00:37:43.293 --> 00:37:48.430
It is supposed to be the intelligent,
short hair, glasses ...


571
00:37:48.451 --> 00:37:50.231
- I never saw that series.
- Okay, whatever.


572
00:37:50.232 --> 00:37:52.392
<i>Unless you want to chat more ,
should go. < / i ></i>


573
00:37:52.759 --> 00:37:54.419
You definitely do not
want to finish well .

574
00:38:02.237 --> 00:38:05.204
This mountain is really fantastic .

575
00:38:05.872 --> 00:38:09.755
Did I mention how much I hate these
snowshoeing ?


576
00:38:09.776 --> 00:38:11.660
Anyone? Anyone?

577
00:38:22.121 --> 00:38:25.114
-Wait!
- Come on, slackers .


578
00:38:26.029 --> 00:38:29.111
Wait! It's here! Here we are !

579
00:38:31.202 --> 00:38:34.274
-Thank God !
- Are you sure?


580
00:38:34.295 --> 00:38:39.607
I saw the pictures hundreds of times , is here .
This is where it happened.


581
00:38:39.618 --> 00:38:42.707
This is the Dyatlov Pass .

582
00:38:47.296 --> 00:38:52.455
53 years ago , nine people
camped at the same site ,


583
00:38:52.471 --> 00:38:55.411
had dinner and went to sleep .

584
00:38:55.415 --> 00:39:00.413
Sometime between 9 and 11 pm ,
something that the Russian authorities


585
00:39:00.414 --> 00:39:03.999
defined as
" an unknown force uncontrollable "


586
00:39:04.015 --> 00:39:07.712
caused all your fleeing
tent in such a panic ,


587
00:39:07.726 --> 00:39:10.727
that tore from inside
and plunged into the darkness ,


588
00:39:10.747 --> 00:39:13.429
to 17 ° C below zero.

589
00:39:13.456 --> 00:39:16.905
You'll love this shot, Andy .
You look like a television chef .


590
00:39:16.927 --> 00:39:18.847
Yes? Which one ?

591
00:39:18.863 --> 00:39:20.701
One gay .

592
00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.387
- It was hard.
- Very nice, Jenson .


593
00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:30.612
Rustem Slobodin , 23,

594
00:39:30.613 --> 00:39:32.644
the first to fall .

595
00:39:32.659 --> 00:39:35.170
Igor Dyatlov , 23,

596
00:39:35.197 --> 00:39:38.296
leader and the most
experienced all of them,


597
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:41.275
probably was his idea
try to get back to the tents .


598
00:39:41.288 --> 00:39:43.983
Kolmogorova Zinaida , 22,

599
00:39:44.012 --> 00:39:46.920
just a year older than
what I am now ,


600
00:39:46.946 --> 00:39:49.483
was the closest to the camp
before I got the "strength "


601
00:39:49.506 --> 00:39:52.405
and was the only
victim with signs of struggle.

602
00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.351
A body language lacked
and much of the oral cavity.


603
00:39:57.006 --> 00:39:59.977
Dubinina Ludmila , 21 years .

604
00:40:00.117 --> 00:40:02.788
Nicolai Thibeaux 
- Brignolles .

605
00:40:03.702 --> 00:40:05.688
Alexander Zolotarev .

606
00:40:06.736 --> 00:40:08.595
Alexander Kolevatov .

607
00:40:10.971 --> 00:40:15.404
The cause of death of all the victims
was listed as hypothermia,


608
00:40:15.435 --> 00:40:19.813
but Rustem and Nicolai also
had serious skull fractures,


609
00:40:19.833 --> 00:40:24.519
and Ludmila and Alexander Zolotarev
had several broken ribs .


610
00:40:25.398 --> 00:40:28.530
No body had defensive wounds

611
00:40:28.549 --> 00:40:31.390
no external wounds of any kind.

612
00:40:31.418 --> 00:40:35.434
Somehow, something might break
Skulls of two men


613
00:40:35.449 --> 00:40:38.706
and break the ribs
Ludmila and Alexander


614
00:40:38.723 --> 00:40:41.549
leaving nothing but bruises.

615
00:40:42.463 --> 00:40:47.438
Additionally, the body of Alexander
had a high degree of radiation.


616
00:40:48.955 --> 00:40:50.349
Hello !

617
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.905
How, in a place like this , Alexander
been exposed to much radiation ?


618
00:40:56.925 --> 00:40:59.013
Why only him?

619
00:40:59.034 --> 00:41:02.405
Krivonischenko georgiy 24 .

620
00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:06.337
Yuri Doroshenko , 21.

621
00:41:07.277 --> 00:41:09.080
While others fled ,

622
00:41:09.108 --> 00:41:11.910
they sat still
near the fire


623
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.632
and quietly
froze to death .


624
00:41:23.331 --> 00:41:25.997
- What is it, Andy ?
- Nothing .


625
00:41:26.018 --> 00:41:28.369
There seems to be "nothing" .

626
00:41:28.391 --> 00:41:31.924
The GPS is wrong , should have been
loaded when we got here .


627
00:41:31.938 --> 00:41:34.079
He went crazy .

628
00:41:34.686 --> 00:41:37.541
And you think that
it is also my fault.


629
00:41:37.563 --> 00:41:39.863
- Do not know. Did you touch him ?
-No!


630
00:41:39.885 --> 00:41:43.732
If so, also screwed with my watch.
My altimeter is ruined.


631
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:45.468
And look at this .

632
00:41:45.491 --> 00:41:50.263
Suunto is a compass . I am guided in the Himalayas ,
perfectly walked everywhere but here.


633
00:41:52.583 --> 00:41:54.602
I think we should go.

634
00:41:55.385 --> 00:41:58.592
- What? Just arrived !
- We have to go back yet but ...


635
00:41:58.608 --> 00:42:01.439
're blind without a GPS
or reliable map .


636
00:42:01.454 --> 00:42:06.833
- What 's wrong with the map?
- We should not have come here yet.


637
00:42:06.866 --> 00:42:08.679
What do you mean ?

638
00:42:08.694 --> 00:42:14.341
According to the map , walked 23 kms today. Not possible
we have come here before midnight .


639
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:16.462
So what? We quickly.

640
00:42:16.463 --> 00:42:19.786
Look, let's pack up and travel
until the compass stabilizes.


641
00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:23.947
Obviously , there is a kind of field
magnetic rock or something.


642
00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:26.739
Let's start elsewhere.
Nobody will notice the difference .


643
00:42:26.755 --> 00:42:30.290
- But it will not match what you recorded earlier.
-Fuck what we recorded , Holly !


644
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:32.518
Obviously something is wrong,
should go !


645
00:42:32.519 --> 00:42:34.396
If we start to pack and ,
make it!


646
00:42:34.397 --> 00:42:36.998
No, no, no.
I also do not want to stay,


647
00:42:36.999 --> 00:42:42.359
but by the time we gather around and get out , we will
end up walking in the dark. Not good.


648
00:42:42.376 --> 00:42:44.153
Guys, it's only for one night .

649
00:42:44.154 --> 00:42:48.758
The people lived thousands of
years without clocks and GPS .

650
00:42:48.769 --> 00:42:51.787
I think we will
do it for one night.

651
00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:53.893
That's why we came.

652
00:42:55.632 --> 00:42:57.513
OK , let's have dinner .

653
00:42:57.532 --> 00:42:59.367
Thank you.

654
00:43:09.648 --> 00:43:11.385
Hey !

655
00:43:11.402 --> 00:43:13.080
He's starting a relationship there,

656
00:43:13.081 --> 00:43:15.251
I feel I am more .

657
00:43:15.252 --> 00:43:17.867
I do not understand what
she sees in this guy .

658
00:43:17.868 --> 00:43:19.307
- He's an asshole ...
- Confident ...


659
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:21.041
- ... full of himself ... - ... cocky ...
- ... arrogant ...


660
00:43:21.051 --> 00:43:25.088
You know , there's room in that tent .
Will not you join them ?


661
00:43:25.114 --> 00:43:28.146
Oh ! Maybe someday you too have

662
00:43:28.162 --> 00:43:31.718
a boyfriend as cute as Andy ...

663
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:33.159
What are you doing ?

664
00:43:33.171 --> 00:43:34.667
Nothing, just ...

665
00:43:35.757 --> 00:43:37.369
Shit !

666
00:43:39.127 --> 00:43:41.326
Thank you.

667
00:43:41.327 --> 00:43:44.009
This is one of the reasons why
you can not find anybody .


668
00:43:44.026 --> 00:43:46.573
No, I can find someone,
but now I'm dating you .


669
00:43:46.601 --> 00:43:48.407
In your dreams ...

670
00:43:51.844 --> 00:43:57.364
What Andy said on ...
a magnetic field so ...


671
00:43:57.365 --> 00:43:59.380
Yes?

672
00:43:59.398 --> 00:44:01.467
And if not that ?

673
00:44:04.645 --> 00:44:06.072
OK

674
00:44:06.088 --> 00:44:08.945
Tell us what you have there .

675
00:44:08.963 --> 00:44:12.271
Well, this is a counter
Geiger pretty basic.


676
00:44:12.297 --> 00:44:16.360
To put it simply ,
detects radiation levels.


677
00:44:21.973 --> 00:44:23.924
As you can hear ...

678
00:44:23.944 --> 00:44:27.142
definitely no radiation
in this area .


679
00:44:27.851 --> 00:44:31.276
It could be uranium in the rock.

680
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:37.817
Not dangerous , but more
radiation than they should .


681
00:44:39.578 --> 00:44:42.264
And the source of it ...

682
00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:44.406
probably comes from there.

683
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:46.361
We will verify .

684
00:44:54.861 --> 00:44:57.517
- It is in this direction.
- Care .


685
00:44:59.242 --> 00:45:01.305
A Lucile not like this.

686
00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:03.607
I think we found something.

687
00:45:05.239 --> 00:45:06.982
Jenson .

688
00:45:07.515 --> 00:45:09.916
See how thin the ice is there?

689
00:45:09.943 --> 00:45:12.094
- Yes
- Snow ...


690
00:45:12.103 --> 00:45:14.086
Yes? What is it?

691
00:45:14.095 --> 00:45:16.773
Looks like someone was here ,

692
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.865
perhaps in the last days .

693
00:45:19.885 --> 00:45:21.752
Be careful !

694
00:45:21.775 --> 00:45:23.596
Ok .

695
00:45:23.614 --> 00:45:25.784
Here , above.

696
00:45:33.467 --> 00:45:35.950
-Holly, beware!
- Ok .


697
00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.233
Wait .

698
00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:42.449
Jenson , do not think that's a rock.

699
00:45:47.513 --> 00:45:50.765
-Shit ! Are you filming this?
- I'm shooting , I'm shooting .


700
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.406
Be careful !

701
00:45:57.612 --> 00:45:59.616
- See this?
- Yes


702
00:45:59.628 --> 00:46:01.515
Go on, go on!

703
00:46:01.536 --> 00:46:03.332
Come on!

704
00:46:06.439 --> 00:46:08.818
- What is that?
- Do not know.


705
00:46:08.842 --> 00:46:11.270
-Oh , God !
-Oh , Jenson !


706
00:46:11.285 --> 00:46:12.663
You see this?

707
00:46:12.674 --> 00:46:14.116
Tellthe camera what you see!

708
00:46:14.133 --> 00:46:15.513
What do you see ?
Come on!


709
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.369
A cave or something ...

710
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:21.859
God , Jenson ...
leave the camera and come help me


711
00:46:22.892 --> 00:46:25.230
-There is a door !
- What?


712
00:46:26.323 --> 00:46:28.082
Leave the camera.

713
00:46:28.101 --> 00:46:30.156
We have to film this.

714
00:46:31.525 --> 00:46:33.549
This is so weird !

715
00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.165
Sure it's weird, Jenson . Watch !

716
00:46:36.805 --> 00:46:39.257
It is a door in the middle
of the mountains!


717
00:46:39.281 --> 00:46:42.281
Is closed from the outside.

718
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.466
It is designed to
keep something inside.


719
00:46:48.891 --> 00:46:51.188
- Yes , but what?
-Holly!


720
00:46:51.205 --> 00:46:52.808
Listen ... Come on!

721
00:46:52.822 --> 00:46:57.112
The Russian government has invested much time and effort
to build a large, solid door


722
00:46:57.135 --> 00:46:59.195
on the mountainside to keep
in what is there , we should ...


723
00:46:59.196 --> 00:47:02.046
Jenson ! What the hell are we here?

724
00:47:02.064 --> 00:47:08.187
Do not you want to know if the " uncontrollable force
unknown "is the Yeti , or aliens , or ...


725
00:47:08.205 --> 00:47:11.253
one built by the Soviets Superman ?

726
00:47:11.283 --> 00:47:14.983
I want to know what happens here
and the answer is behind that door !


727
00:47:15.018 --> 00:47:18.255
Could you help me
to open it , please?

728
00:47:19.812 --> 00:47:21.455
OK?

729
00:47:28.536 --> 00:47:30.199
Wait .

730
00:47:34.029 --> 00:47:40.125
- It's moving ...
- Now open ,


731
00:47:40.144 --> 00:47:42.664
but is stuck on the ice .

732
00:47:43.796 --> 00:47:47.671
Well, that means that
can melt the ice ...


733
00:47:47.672 --> 00:47:51.532
- Well , let's call the other , water 's heat ...
- No, no, no. Jesus.


734
00:47:52.385 --> 00:47:55.050
- No, because ...
- Why?


735
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.761
They're quite nervous ,
and this is going to go crazy , and ...


736
00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:03.071
... and I do not want to move the camp ,
Do you understand ? So ...


737
00:48:03.087 --> 00:48:04.659
contémosles morning .

738
00:48:04.674 --> 00:48:07.898
Now let this, and
back later, okay?


739
00:48:25.785 --> 00:48:27.696
Hello , friends ! 
What happens ?

740
00:48:27.697 --> 00:48:30.013
- Are we going to bed?
- Sure .


741
00:48:30.754 --> 00:48:32.505
Good night.

742
00:48:33.548 --> 00:48:35.869
- Good night , Holly .
- Good evening .


743
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.735
Good night , boys.

744
00:48:39.894 --> 00:48:41.926
What are you reading ?

745
00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.333
" Slaughterhouse 5" .

746
00:48:46.951 --> 00:48:49.471
- Do not like Vonnegut ?
- I love that book.


747
00:48:49.486 --> 00:48:52.156
- I was just thinking about him yesterday
-Great!


748
00:48:52.189 --> 00:48:54.208
Very impressive !

749
00:48:54.571 --> 00:48:57.144
- Sit back, Professor .
- Thank you.


750
00:48:57.903 --> 00:48:59.936
Let's put this here ...

751
00:49:07.079 --> 00:49:11.198
You know , it is impossible to warm

752
00:49:12.125 --> 00:49:15.237
when you're sitting
on snow all the time.


753
00:49:15.267 --> 00:49:18.651
I think my ass is numb
since we left Vizhaj .


754
00:49:20.754 --> 00:49:24.464
- Find anything with the Geiger counter ?
- No, it's perfectly safe .


755
00:49:24.484 --> 00:49:26.042
Good!

756
00:49:26.058 --> 00:49:30.277
I mean , I think they expected
find something to your movie.


757
00:49:30.293 --> 00:49:32.299
There is still time .

758
00:49:36.555 --> 00:49:38.462
Young Love .

759
00:49:40.149 --> 00:49:42.985
Do not be so sure ...

760
00:49:43.014 --> 00:49:47.054
Thatcher is a good guy , but
not think I have paste boyfriend.


761
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.190
Do not ? I
think it 's looking good.

762
00:49:51.142 --> 00:49:54.286
He talks like a teacher
the " affair hiker " .


763
00:49:54.321 --> 00:49:56.262
Does " hiker affair "?

764
00:49:56.295 --> 00:49:59.074
Yes , let's see ...

765
00:49:59.799 --> 00:50:03.199
It takes a girl
to the middle of nowhere

766
00:50:03.225 --> 00:50:07.538
especially when it is cold and needs
someone to cuddle ...


767
00:50:07.561 --> 00:50:10.102
How romantic , my God!

768
00:50:10.116 --> 00:50:12.761
- And that's not the worst ...
- Do you have herpes ?


769
00:50:14.362 --> 00:50:16.439
No, not to my knowledge .

770
00:50:16.959 --> 00:50:18.862
Did you see the camera of your phone?

771
00:50:18.884 --> 00:50:21.283
Oh , no! Is it recorded ?

772
00:50:21.303 --> 00:50:25.448
Not just to shoot landscapes, but
has a camera on the bedpost .


773
00:50:25.449 --> 00:50:27.319
No! Denise !

774
00:50:27.342 --> 00:50:29.231
Is lost ...

775
00:50:30.657 --> 00:50:33.131
And what is your tactic on excursions ?

776
00:50:36.396 --> 00:50:39.164
This is my friend ...

777
00:50:39.182 --> 00:50:41.008
Whisky Colonel .

778
00:50:41.032 --> 00:50:43.696
- Hello , Colonel.
- Yes, please .


779
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.027
John Patrick Hauser ,

780
00:50:46.051 --> 00:50:48.677
Are you trying to get me drunk?

781
00:50:48.699 --> 00:50:52.830
It's the easiest way to get
" paradoxical nudity " .


782
00:50:54.746 --> 00:50:56.381
Mmm . It's good.

783
00:51:00.248 --> 00:51:04.559
- Can you believe that? - Do not worry,
is just a " hiker affair " .


784
00:51:04.575 --> 00:51:07.822
- What is an " affair hiker "?
- You're still in the race ...


785
00:51:07.853 --> 00:51:12.308
Not sure I want
discards of that subject .


786
00:51:13.095 --> 00:51:16.299
You can always call Lucile , right?

787
00:51:16.326 --> 00:51:18.620
You laugh , but ...

788
00:51:18.653 --> 00:51:22.503
Oregon legal if married
with a camera, then ...


789
00:51:22.534 --> 00:51:25.493
I would. But unfortunately it is not ,

790
00:51:25.516 --> 00:51:28.765
so we have to keep
a professional relationship ...


791
00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:30.801
... mostly .

792
00:51:44.671 --> 00:51:47.567
Well, I'm going to ...

793
00:51:48.621 --> 00:51:50.695
- ... to sleep.
- Very good .


794
00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:55.775
- Good evening .
- Good evening .


795
00:51:55.785 --> 00:51:57.488
Sweet dreams.

796
00:52:05.074 --> 00:52:08.486
Forgive us for having accused
to forge traces .


797
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:13.417
All right. If I had known that it was not me ,
would have thought the same.


798
00:52:13.436 --> 00:52:16.507
We hasten to take
wrong conclusion.


799
00:52:16.532 --> 00:52:20.247
I expected you to give us a slap ,
but you would not.


800
00:52:21.893 --> 00:52:25.015
Well , if you want to apologize ...

801
00:52:25.034 --> 00:52:29.149
Could you give me something hot
with what curl ?


802
00:52:30.736 --> 00:52:32.628
- Really?
- Yes


803
00:52:34.164 --> 00:52:35.818
Yes.

804
00:52:39.505 --> 00:52:42.343
It's six o'clock .

805
00:52:42.344 --> 00:52:44.923
So it's the third day ,

806
00:52:46.487 --> 00:52:49.613
Y. .. it's time to meet Denise .

807
00:53:06.254 --> 00:53:09.294
- What are you doing ?
- Huh?


808
00:53:09.316 --> 00:53:12.556
- Our own movie .
- Are you ready again?


809
00:53:12.571 --> 00:53:14.487
What surprises you ?

810
00:53:14.503 --> 00:53:16.806
I'm not surprised ,
I'm impressed.


811
00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:19.215
Impressed ? ?

812
00:53:21.172 --> 00:53:22.394
Turn that off .

813
00:53:22.395 --> 00:53:24.638
- What?
-Turn it off !


814
00:53:24.639 --> 00:53:27.024
Do not tell me you never
you filmed yourself having sex ...


815
00:53:27.025 --> 00:53:30.003
-Andy !
-Oh , wait! That's part of the show .


816
00:53:30.004 --> 00:53:31.606
Oh ! Remember the dinner
we had in Ivdel ?

817
00:53:31.607 --> 00:53:33.597
- Did you in Ivdel ... ?
-Andy !


818
00:53:43.429 --> 00:53:44.907
Shit !

819
00:53:44.924 --> 00:53:47.029
What was that ?

820
00:53:47.049 --> 00:53:49.492
- Andy , what was that? What was that ?
- You heard him , right? -Yes ! Fuck! Shit !


821
00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.373
Guys?

822
00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:54.855
Is everyone all right ?

823
00:53:54.879 --> 00:53:56.772
What is that ?

824
00:53:57.678 --> 00:53:59.174
What the fuck is that?

825
00:53:59.439 --> 00:54:00.886
Shit !

826
00:54:00.902 --> 00:54:03.678
Denise ! Get your stuff !

827
00:54:03.698 --> 00:54:05.313
Denise , get up!

828
00:54:05.359 --> 00:54:06.815
Avalanche !

829
00:54:09.144 --> 00:54:10.775
Come on, hurry !

830
00:54:11.291 --> 00:54:13.571
Denise !
Run, run !


831
00:54:15.097 --> 00:54:16.617
Come on!

832
00:54:17.108 --> 00:54:18.770
Denise , come!

833
00:54:26.106 --> 00:54:27.684
Denise !

834
00:54:31.719 --> 00:54:33.296
No!

835
00:54:34.548 --> 00:54:36.195
Andy !

836
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:50.108
Oh , God !

837
00:54:50.433 --> 00:54:51.960
Oh , my God !

838
00:54:55.667 --> 00:54:58.085
-Denise !
-Denise ! Denise !


839
00:54:59.306 --> 00:55:01.253
There is !

840
00:55:01.275 --> 00:55:02.946
Denise is dead !

841
00:55:02.962 --> 00:55:06.251
No, must be sheltered somewhere!

842
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.190
Died !

843
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:10.396
Died !

844
00:55:18.474 --> 00:55:20.526
You abandoned her !

845
00:55:21.204 --> 00:55:23.772
-The abandoned !
-Fuck you !


846
00:55:26.276 --> 00:55:29.891
-It was just a hiker affair for you ... !
-Shut up, now!


847
00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:32.748
He's right ! Nothing
we can do for her!


848
00:55:32.766 --> 00:55:35.336
-She was killed !
-It was an avalanche !


849
00:55:35.337 --> 00:55:39.333
Awake ! They will try to kill us
bury to look like an accident!


850
00:55:39.368 --> 00:55:42.396
Crazyshit! As if there were
avalanches in the real world !


851
00:55:42.403 --> 00:55:45.072
Are you saying you did not see
those explosions ?


852
00:55:45.088 --> 00:55:48.339
Huh? Or was it a ghost of a
mountain explorer ?


853
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:50.310
-Do not know what happened !
- What? What?


854
00:55:50.311 --> 00:55:52.606
Any notices ,
look around you !


855
00:55:52.622 --> 00:55:57.332
I had to request authorizations,
and sent travel plans .


856
00:55:57.354 --> 00:56:00.824
JP , they knew exactly where
and when we arrive .


857
00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:03.287
They waited until we fell asleep ,
Jenson is right,


858
00:56:03.303 --> 00:56:05.025
Someone is trying to kill us!

859
00:56:05.034 --> 00:56:06.919
- Jesus, Holly. Do you?
-Oh , God !


860
00:56:06.933 --> 00:56:08.958
OK . So tell me, who are they?

861
00:56:08.974 --> 00:56:10.912
The military !

862
00:56:10.923 --> 00:56:14.046
-This is serious ... !
-You can not prove anything ... !


863
00:56:14.058 --> 00:56:17.322
Shut up! Shut up! OK?

864
00:56:17.344 --> 00:56:20.943
I can not believe Denise is dead ,
but it is , OK?


865
00:56:20.954 --> 00:56:25.507
Now we have to calm and focus
not to lose anyone else , OK?


866
00:56:25.525 --> 00:56:29.379
- Andy , what do we do ?
- My backpack, first aid kit .


867
00:56:34.706 --> 00:56:37.158
OK . Now what do we do?

868
00:56:37.184 --> 00:56:39.594
They have to immobilize my legs

869
00:56:39.616 --> 00:56:41.927
OK . Jenson , take the camera.

870
00:56:41.945 --> 00:56:44.804
- I can do that.
-Be careful, Holly!


871
00:56:45.398 --> 00:56:47.880
Sorry, sorry , sorry!

872
00:56:48.097 --> 00:56:51.536
-Andy ! I cut the pants .
- OK .


873
00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:54.087
-I will be very quick !
- OK .


874
00:56:54.107 --> 00:56:55.543
Just do not ...

875
00:56:55.556 --> 00:56:58.061
Wait, try to be gentle .

876
00:56:58.062 --> 00:57:00.414
Shit !
Shit , OK .


877
00:57:00.435 --> 00:57:03.046
Andy , be still . 
He'll be fine .

878
00:57:05.766 --> 00:57:08.658
OK , OK , I will do so.

879
00:57:08.689 --> 00:57:10.822
OK , JP,

880
00:57:10.834 --> 00:57:13.614
going to have to help ...

881
00:57:13.631 --> 00:57:17.137
Oh , God ! OK
, OK , OK ...

882
00:57:17.153 --> 00:57:20.388
- God is good. - What?
- OK , OK , OK ...


883
00:57:20.406 --> 00:57:24.395
-I can not do it , JP !
- Okay . I do it .


884
00:57:24.954 --> 00:57:27.606
Not so bad , it's just ...

885
00:57:27.622 --> 00:57:30.963
Jenson , go get a wood or
something to use as a splint ...


886
00:57:30.979 --> 00:57:33.818
-No, no, no!
- Not so bad , you'll be fine .


887
00:57:33.848 --> 00:57:38.171
You'll be fine , I promise ...

888
00:57:38.189 --> 00:57:41.742
This will hurt a little,
hurt a little , OK?


889
00:57:41.757 --> 00:57:45.099
You have to accommodate ,
now have to accommodate .


890
00:57:45.907 --> 00:57:47.309
- Well, brother.
- Yes


891
00:57:47.326 --> 00:57:49.120
I'm going to count
to three , okay ?

892
00:57:49.141 --> 00:57:51.288
- Take a deep breath , get ready .
- Yes


893
00:57:51.308 --> 00:57:53.415
- Are you ready ?
- Do it.


894
00:57:53.416 --> 00:57:55.138
Sure, three.

895
00:57:55.151 --> 00:57:56.419
Ready ?
One ..


896
00:57:58.129 --> 00:58:00.647
That was not so bad !
That was not so bad !


897
00:58:00.662 --> 00:58:02.186
Not for you !

898
00:58:02.205 --> 00:58:05.131
- That's it, it's over.
-No! - OK .


899
00:58:09.809 --> 00:58:12.605
- Okay .
- Is this thing on?


900
00:58:12.621 --> 00:58:15.083
Turn it off !Not want
to see me ... !

901
00:58:23.815 --> 00:58:26.223
This does not work .

902
00:58:26.241 --> 00:58:29.166
I paid for the international plan .

903
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.323
This is stupid . We need help.
We light a flare.


904
00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.188
- If we did this sees the flare ...
-No one ... did this!


905
00:58:36.189 --> 00:58:38.687
I do not know , JP . 
Maybe Jenson is right.

906
00:58:38.701 --> 00:58:40.711
No!

907
00:58:40.929 --> 00:58:47.082
So Andy risked his life to take his backpack.
It's dark and if there is someone there, they have to do .


908
00:58:48.797 --> 00:58:50.838
Do you have to shoot ?

909
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:55.082
No matter how this ends ,
I want to make records of what happened to us ,


910
00:58:55.097 --> 00:58:58.873
well not done as
another mystery of Dyatlov .


911
00:59:00.285 --> 00:59:03.523
If we are to do ,
Can not we find shelter before?


912
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:06.895
Not think we can move to Andy .

913
00:59:06.908 --> 00:59:08.950
What was that ?

914
00:59:08.964 --> 00:59:10.982
- What?
- That look ...


915
00:59:10.999 --> 00:59:13.765
What the hell is going on?

916
00:59:16.425 --> 00:59:20.087
We found something before
with the Geiger counter .


917
00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:25.440
What did you find ?

918
00:59:26.514 --> 00:59:28.527
A door .

919
00:59:29.293 --> 00:59:31.107
What?

920
00:59:31.123 --> 00:59:36.477
We were freezing our fucking in snow
all day,and is there a fucking bunker here ? !


921
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:41.111
But we could not open
and radiation is ... strong .


922
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:45.837
How strong ?

923
00:59:46.489 --> 00:59:48.978
Not dangerous, but ...

924
00:59:49.791 --> 00:59:51.794
Incredible !

925
00:59:58.074 --> 01:00:00.131
Faked ? Traces ?

926
01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.168
No!
No traces faked .


927
01:00:03.358 --> 01:00:05.281
Do not think so.

928
01:00:05.308 --> 01:00:08.176
Perfect , I think .

929
01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.376
OK .

930
01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:22.268
If someone triggered this avalanche ,
is right in there , right?


931
01:00:22.284 --> 01:00:23.590
Yes.

932
01:00:23.606 --> 01:00:29.434
Let's throw the flares , we bring someone ,
and whoever did this will not kill us.


933
01:00:29.816 --> 01:00:31.821
OK .

934
01:00:45.818 --> 01:00:47.255
Come on!

935
01:00:52.166 --> 01:00:53.951
What?

936
01:00:55.431 --> 01:00:57.827
Orange lights in the sky .

937
01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.668
JP , I'm sorry .

938
01:01:05.915 --> 01:01:07.925
I should have told ,

939
01:01:07.939 --> 01:01:11.770
but you were so concerned
with the compass , and ...


940
01:01:11.786 --> 01:01:13.805
and map, and ...

941
01:01:14.914 --> 01:01:18.055
did not want anything
for this to happen.


942
01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.489
Yes ..

943
01:01:23.495 --> 01:01:27.103
You followed step by step how
killed nine people ,


944
01:01:27.123 --> 01:01:29.763
What did you think would happen ?

945
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.866
I do not know .

946
01:01:36.479 --> 01:01:38.497
I just ...

947
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:44.001
I always felt attracted to this place ,

948
01:01:44.026 --> 01:01:47.922
do not know why ,
I can not explain .


949
01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:52.035
I did not want this.

950
01:01:54.122 --> 01:01:57.609
Do you think anyone
saw the flare ?


951
01:01:58.247 --> 01:02:00.016
I do not know .

952
01:02:00.931 --> 01:02:05.362
I will not be sitting here a long time .
I will open that door , there is radiation or not , OK?


953
01:02:05.364 --> 01:02:07.179
Yes.

954
01:02:07.197 --> 01:02:09.026
OK .

955
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:13.058
You want blueberry pancakes
or macaroni and cheese ?


956
01:02:13.086 --> 01:02:15.929
Have breakfast blueberry pancakes .

957
01:02:15.936 --> 01:02:17.797
Eat .

958
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:19.323
Jenson ...

959
01:02:19.341 --> 01:02:22.221
- What is it ?
- Friend ...


960
01:02:22.246 --> 01:02:24.772
I'm sorry about Denise ,

961
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:29.510
Really. You can think what you want ,
but sorry .

01:02:54.774 --> 01:02:57.731
- We're being followed .

971
01:02:57.752 --> 01:02:59.228

01:04:13.877 --> 01:04:15.022
Open it !

1000
01:04:15.033 --> 01:04:17.879
It is open only
struck by the ice.


1001
01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:19.903
Guys ! Guys !

1006
01:04:36.758 --> 01:04:38.133
Trábala !

1007
01:04:38.142 --> 01:04:41.243
The lock is on the other side!
Help me to hold it closed !


1008
01:04:41.254 --> 01:04:43.699
-God, we be locked up !
- JP ?


1009
01:04:43.717 --> 01:04:45.050
- Yes ?
- Are you okay?


1010
01:04:45.051 --> 01:04:46.827
No, I'm bleeding a lot.

1011
01:04:46.844 --> 01:04:48.718
Pressed onto the wound.

1012
01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:51.838
- Okay .
- Shut up a second.


1013
01:04:51.852 --> 01:04:54.664
Turn on the camera ,
the camera light .


1014
01:04:54.679 --> 01:04:56.310
God !

1015
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.128
OK , I turned it on .

1016
01:05:03.263 --> 01:05:05.266
Oh , God !

1017
01:05:05.286 --> 01:05:07.730
What do you see ?

1018
01:05:08.735 --> 01:05:10.433
It's a tunnel !

1019
01:05:10.457 --> 01:05:13.234
- What?
- We are in a tunnel.


1020
01:05:20.047 --> 01:05:21.850
OK .

1021
01:05:28.342 --> 01:05:30.311
What do you see ?

1022
01:05:31.932 --> 01:05:34.882
A switch ... a power switch .

1023
01:05:34.899 --> 01:05:37.653
-Turn it on !
- OK .


1024
01:05:45.018 --> 01:05:48.139
- Works .
- Thank God !


1025
01:05:48.163 --> 01:05:50.504
- We lock the door
- Why?


1026
01:05:50.505 --> 01:05:53.488
Because if you work outside,
can go at any time .


1027
01:05:53.489 --> 01:05:56.162
Nobody is going to come in here , man .
Not going to waste bullets.


1028
01:05:56.163 --> 01:05:58.681
- Damn, Jenson ...
- Did you see where we are?


1029
01:05:58.682 --> 01:06:01.497
No one will come to save us.

1030
01:06:01.509 --> 01:06:03.975
We are alone .

1031
01:06:03.987 --> 01:06:07.268
They know that in a few days
'll be dehydrated ...


1032
01:06:07.282 --> 01:06:10.635
and not have to worry

1033
01:06:11.457 --> 01:06:16.451
Then I just close the door
and return in a week .


1034
01:06:16.461 --> 01:06:18.938
Unless we find a way out.

1035
01:06:18.952 --> 01:06:21.478
- Can you walk?
- Yes


1036
01:06:21.496 --> 01:06:24.393
- OK .
- Beware , beware.


1037
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:26.253
Shit !

1038
01:06:27.597 --> 01:06:29.491
OK .

1039
01:06:30.402 --> 01:06:32.425
- Come right .
- OK .


1040
01:06:33.891 --> 01:06:36.530
- Jenson , stay close.
- OK .


1041
01:06:36.543 --> 01:06:39.114
Slow down , slow down.

1042
01:06:47.042 --> 01:06:48.582
OK ,

1043
01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.637
wait a minute.

1044
01:06:56.394 --> 01:06:59.343
Shit, shit !
Another tunnel, a tunnel.


1045
01:07:00.357 --> 01:07:01.861
JP , JP ...

1046
01:07:02.361 --> 01:07:03.868
What?
What!


1047
01:07:05.676 --> 01:07:07.434
What happened?

1048
01:07:07.446 --> 01:07:09.000
I felt something .

1049
01:07:09.022 --> 01:07:10.651
What?

1050
01:07:11.148 --> 01:07:12.977
There is something here !

1051
01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:15.556
- Follow me.
-There is something here , Jenson , I swear!


1052
01:07:15.591 --> 01:07:17.358
There's nobody here , Holly .

1053
01:07:17.374 --> 01:07:19.207
Come on!

1054
01:07:21.168 --> 01:07:22.674
Shit !

1055
01:07:22.697 --> 01:07:25.356
- Which way?
- Left .


1056
01:07:25.367 --> 01:07:28.580
- Go slow. Slowly, slowly .
- Well .


1057
01:07:29.937 --> 01:07:31.892
The lights are on here .

1058
01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:34.625
- Stay close .
- OK .


1059
01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.181
Shit .

1060
01:07:36.194 --> 01:07:38.647
- Do not get ahead much .
- No.


1061
01:07:49.454 --> 01:07:50.998
Jesus!

1062
01:07:53.573 --> 01:07:55.229
What is this place?

1063
01:07:55.249 --> 01:07:56.832
It is a ...

1064
01:07:56.847 --> 01:07:58.880
laboratory , I think.

1065
01:08:00.062 --> 01:08:01.639
Or was .

1066
01:08:01.653 --> 01:08:03.682
What happened here ?

1067
01:08:03.695 --> 01:08:05.693
Who knows ?

1068
01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:08.225
Sit down, let me see
, let me see .

1069
01:08:08.239 --> 01:08:10.224
Wait ...

1070
01:08:10.237 --> 01:08:12.008
Toma.

1071
01:08:12.024 --> 01:08:13.892
Use this.

1072
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:18.579
This will hurt.

1073
01:08:21.762 --> 01:08:23.403
I'm sorry .

1074
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:29.156
Will serve for a few minutes .

1075
01:08:40.713 --> 01:08:42.727
I found an opening .

1076
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:46.372
- Be careful.
- Yes , no problem .


1077
01:08:52.347 --> 01:08:54.355
Look at this place .

1078
01:09:04.145 --> 01:09:06.499
Holly , come here. Look at this.

1079
01:09:08.615 --> 01:09:12.050
- What is that?
- A blog , I think.


1080
01:09:14.914 --> 01:09:16.672
Know word

1081
01:09:16.688 --> 01:09:18.822
- Yes ?
- Yes ..


1082
01:09:18.836 --> 01:09:21.643
I saw it many times while
doing my research .


1083
01:09:21.644 --> 01:09:23.654
What does it mean ?

1084
01:09:24.462 --> 01:09:26.644
Killed in action .

1085
01:09:26.668 --> 01:09:28.699
Of course.

1086
01:09:28.766 --> 01:09:30.789
Can you understand more ?

1087
01:09:30.807 --> 01:09:32.824
Only dates.

1088
01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:34.866
1945.

1089
01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.257
1959.

1090
01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:41.706
The year that killed explorers.

1091
01:09:41.725 --> 01:09:43.762
And then terminated .

1092
01:09:48.446 --> 01:09:50.954
What?
It's a boat.


1093
01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:53.414
Is Eldridge ,

1094
01:09:53.429 --> 01:09:56.899
Is the USS Eldridge
, the Philadelphia Experiment .

1095
01:09:56.918 --> 01:09:59.164
What Philadelphia Experiment ?

1096
01:09:59.174 --> 01:10:02.209
Come on! Do you
live under a rock ?

1097
01:10:02.883 --> 01:10:04.891
In 1943 ,

1098
01:10:04.907 --> 01:10:10.117
U.S. government conducted
an experiment with that vessel.


1099
01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.315
What kind of experiment?

1100
01:10:12.328 --> 01:10:14.342
Teleportation .

1101
01:10:14.362 --> 01:10:16.241
Oh , my God!

1102
01:10:16.255 --> 01:10:20.018
There were rumors that there were people
that was fused with the boat ,


1103
01:10:20.036 --> 01:10:22.787
but no one has
ever seen anything like this.

1104
01:10:22.812 --> 01:10:26.145
These photos should be
ultra , ultra secret .

1105
01:10:26.914 --> 01:10:29.347
They could kill someone for this.

1106
01:10:29.364 --> 01:10:31.314
Oh , God !

1107
01:10:31.334 --> 01:10:33.125
OK .

1108
01:10:33.138 --> 01:10:35.050
We gotta get out of here .

1109
01:10:35.058 --> 01:10:37.949
- Yes
- JP , can you move ?


1110
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:40.202
- No.
- Shit .


1111
01:10:40.232 --> 01:10:43.936
I will not leave here , you know?
Think of something .


1112
01:10:43.959 --> 01:10:46.005
Find a way out.

1113
01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:52.074
OK , when found , will
and drag you out myself .


1114
01:10:52.432 --> 01:10:54.436
Come on!

1115
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:19.917
Jesus Christ!

1116
01:11:41.388 --> 01:11:44.827
A cavern is formed
naturally ...


1117
01:11:44.844 --> 01:11:48.954
I do not think that has an exit . Perhaps the widened
a little, that's all.


1118
01:11:48.956 --> 01:11:51.078
Now you're a caver ?

1119
01:11:51.094 --> 01:11:53.102
Watch this

1120
01:11:53.121 --> 01:11:57.535
It looks like a nuclear power cell .
So no electricity here .


1121
01:11:57.554 --> 01:12:01.702
Alexander was here. Here you
taking radiation.


1122
01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:04.962
There must be a way out.

1123
01:12:08.106 --> 01:12:10.131
Watch out!

1124
01:12:13.472 --> 01:12:15.478
Oh , God !

1125
01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:24.612
What is that ?

1126
01:12:34.499 --> 01:12:37.484
- It still works .
- Give it to me .


1127
01:12:40.016 --> 01:12:42.872
I told someone had been here recently.

1128
01:12:42.903 --> 01:12:44.764
Who is ?

1129
01:12:44.779 --> 01:12:46.624
A military .

1130
01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:50.258
Why are you here ?

1131
01:12:53.212 --> 01:12:59.340
If you are thinking of killing five Americans
to keep a secret buried for 50 years,


1132
01:12:59.353 --> 01:13:03.892
send someone to ensure
there is still a secret to keep.


1133
01:13:07.752 --> 01:13:10.171
- What are you doing ?
- Checking something.


1134
01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:11.997
Shit !

1135
01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:16.631
What we found in the meteorological tower ...

1136
01:13:16.652 --> 01:13:19.153
Was your tongue?

1137
01:13:21.383 --> 01:13:23.560
How did it get there?

1138
01:13:23.572 --> 01:13:25.592
They must have left something out .

1139
01:13:25.608 --> 01:13:27.795
So the door was lock.

1140
01:13:27.796 --> 01:13:31.961
Could they have been
experimenting with it , perhaps?


1141
01:13:31.977 --> 01:13:34.707
Said that was common.

1142
01:13:34.708 --> 01:13:36.466
My God !

1143
01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:39.138
Holly, look at the bullet holes .

1144
01:13:39.154 --> 01:13:41.162
This was not a laboratory

1145
01:13:41.181 --> 01:13:43.298
was an execution chamber .

1146
01:13:43.314 --> 01:13:45.347
Oh , God !

1147
01:13:46.324 --> 01:13:48.836
Holly , what 's that?

1148
01:13:57.701 --> 01:14:00.082
It seems one of the
soldiers of that book .

1149
01:14:09.726 --> 01:14:11.899
I do not understand .

1150
01:14:11.916 --> 01:14:14.640
-Jenson !
- These things , no ...


1151
01:14:15.405 --> 01:14:17.521
do not look normal .

1152
01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.914
Maybe that's what he left out .

1153
01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.284
What the hell was that?

1154
01:14:36.571 --> 01:14:38.571
Wait!

1155
01:14:38.592 --> 01:14:40.626
That door was not open.

1156
01:14:40.645 --> 01:14:42.655
Do not ?

1157
01:14:49.616 --> 01:14:51.633
Be careful !

1158
01:14:56.712 --> 01:14:58.462
What was that ?

1159
01:14:58.477 --> 01:15:00.213
JP ? ?

1160
01:15:01.182 --> 01:15:02.895
God !

1161
01:15:08.652 --> 01:15:10.656
There is something here , Jenson .

1162
01:15:16.191 --> 01:15:18.402
-Oh , no!
-My God !


1163
01:15:23.851 --> 01:15:27.852
- Is that blood ?
- We gotta get out of here .


1164
01:15:31.275 --> 01:15:33.408
- What is that?
- Do not know.


1165
01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:36.090
- A kind of light ?
- No, what is below .


1166
01:15:36.107 --> 01:15:38.123
Let me see .

1167
01:15:39.171 --> 01:15:43.776
It is this same camera , and has battery.
See what has .


1168
01:15:43.824 --> 01:15:46.834
<i>-No recordings !
-I want you to tell the camera! < / I ></i>


1169
01:15:46.854 --> 01:15:50.572
<i>-must leave now , please!
- The Cold War ended , we're friends now . < / I ></i>


1170
01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:54.429
- I do not ...
- Adelántala before the battery runs out .


1171
01:15:54.457 --> 01:15:56.095
<i>died . < / i ></i>

1172
01:16:01.058 --> 01:16:02.991
To !

1173
01:16:03.023 --> 01:16:04.970
<i>See what has . < / i ></i>

1174
01:16:04.998 --> 01:16:08.081
<i>-No recordings !
-I want you to tell the camera ...</i>


1175
01:16:08.553 --> 01:16:10.584
Shit !

1176
01:16:13.992 --> 01:16:16.005
This is impossible !

1177
01:16:16.027 --> 01:16:17.908
No, maybe not ...

1178
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:21.810
Remember the Eldridge ,
the Philadelphia Experiment ?


1179
01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:26.292
Were supposed to teleport
Philadelphia to Norfolk.


1180
01:16:26.308 --> 01:16:28.375
- So?
- So ...


1181
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:33.462
Norfolk should reach 10 minutes
before leaving Philadelphia.


1182
01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.639
You mean you made ??a
damn time machine?


1183
01:16:36.653 --> 01:16:41.363
No. I'm saying that no one , not even
our best scientists ,


1184
01:16:41.364 --> 01:16:43.803
neither the government , none

1185
01:16:43.804 --> 01:16:48.424
knew what was happening ,
they did not know what they got .


1186
01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:52.467
Holly, all these experiments
were abandoned.


1187
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:58.282
The crew of the Eldridge , who did not finish
fused with a bulkhead , went crazy .


1188
01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.873
Some of them underwent changes ...

1189
01:17:01.891 --> 01:17:04.278
mutations ...

1190
01:17:04.293 --> 01:17:07.223
There was supposed to be
do these things .


1191
01:17:08.053 --> 01:17:09.915
JP !

1192
01:17:12.334 --> 01:17:14.336
Jenson , come on!

1193
01:17:14.576 --> 01:17:16.383
Come on!

1194
01:17:20.665 --> 01:17:22.466
JP !

1195
01:17:35.302 --> 01:17:37.100
Jenson !

1196
01:17:42.881 --> 01:17:44.679
Jenson !

1197
01:17:47.112 --> 01:17:49.487
What are you doing ? Come here !

1198
01:18:19.457 --> 01:18:22.780
- Where'd they go?
- Came back for me.


1199
01:18:22.794 --> 01:18:25.435
Do not have . Calm down now.

1200
01:18:43.815 --> 01:18:46.320
-JP !
-Come on !


1201
01:18:48.677 --> 01:18:50.744
They're on the roof! On the roof !

1202
01:18:50.762 --> 01:18:52.529
Jenson !

1203
01:18:52.530 --> 01:18:54.577
-Jesus Christ!
-Jenson !


1204
01:18:57.294 --> 01:18:59.573
- Where are they?
-I do not know !


1205
01:18:59.599 --> 01:19:01.803
Look, they're up there!

1206
01:19:03.639 --> 01:19:06.151
- Jenson , where does it go?
-I do not know !


1207
01:19:06.399 --> 01:19:08.807
- Where did he go?
-Go with JP !


1208
01:19:14.226 --> 01:19:15.749
Jenson !

1209
01:19:19.148 --> 01:19:22.340
We have to get him out of the door!
When you do, run! Understand !


1210
01:19:22.355 --> 01:19:23.928
Understood !

1211
01:19:26.533 --> 01:19:29.523
-Run! - Beware!
-Go, go !


1212
01:19:29.957 --> 01:19:31.596
-Over here !
-Come on!


1213
01:19:31.932 --> 01:19:33.675
Run!
Go !


1214
01:19:33.946 --> 01:19:36.027
Jenson , over here!

1215
01:20:03.873 --> 01:20:06.968
Poe ? Let us run?
Why did they stop?


1216
01:20:06.993 --> 01:20:12.324
I do not know . We should be dead.
Why not kill us when they could ?


1217
01:20:23.767 --> 01:20:25.849
What the hell is that?

1218
01:20:26.939 --> 01:20:29.026
It's like a giant fossil .

1219
01:20:40.237 --> 01:20:43.770
- What are you doing ?
- Waiting for us .


1220
01:20:44.726 --> 01:20:48.894
-JP ! I said I would for him ...
- You can not , you saw what they did .


1221
01:20:48.902 --> 01:20:51.980
If we open that door ,
we will do the same .


1222
01:20:51.995 --> 01:20:57.611
We are stuck , and they know it.
We are here because they want it .


1223
01:21:01.964 --> 01:21:04.708
- Holly , did you see that ?
- Yes


1224
01:21:06.378 --> 01:21:08.404
Do it again .

1225
01:21:17.356 --> 01:21:19.813
- You shot it , right?
- Yes


1226
01:21:19.827 --> 01:21:21.552
Right.

1227
01:21:22.523 --> 01:21:24.919
I knew, I knew ...

1228
01:21:25.727 --> 01:21:28.450
- What?
- Teleportation .


1229
01:21:28.857 --> 01:21:32.549
These creatures ,
how disappeared ...


1230
01:21:32.565 --> 01:21:34.799
turned ... intangibles.

1231
01:21:35.489 --> 01:21:37.529
You can teleport .

1232
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.879
But not through these doors.

1233
01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:44.211
So are locked on the outside .

1234
01:21:44.713 --> 01:21:49.110
There must be a connection
between those things and this place .


1235
01:21:59.567 --> 01:22:01.570
They come from here ,

1236
01:22:01.579 --> 01:22:03.585
came across this.

1237
01:22:03.598 --> 01:22:05.467
It makes sense ...

1238
01:22:05.481 --> 01:22:07.414
It's like ...

1239
01:22:07.429 --> 01:22:09.033
a giant ...

1240
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:11.133
" wormhole " .

1241
01:22:11.142 --> 01:22:12.898
Like a ...

1242
01:22:12.914 --> 01:22:14.764
teleporter .

1243
01:22:14.777 --> 01:22:17.756
- How did you come here ?
- Do not know.


1244
01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:25.584
Holly,

1245
01:22:25.609 --> 01:22:30.605
Mansi , natives ,
have been here for thousands of years.


1246
01:22:30.621 --> 01:22:35.256
I do not know how this thing but
These drawings are surely them.


1247
01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:41.285
So they built
a teleporter ?


1248
01:22:41.301 --> 01:22:46.508
I do not know , maybe. Perhaps they found it
in a cave and did these drawings .


1249
01:22:46.529 --> 01:22:50.041
It may be some kind of
alien technology ,


1250
01:22:50.059 --> 01:22:52.498
maybe they were making a weapon.

1251
01:22:52.514 --> 01:22:56.647
What if there were more sites like
this around the world?


1252
01:22:56.663 --> 01:22:58.877
If those things came out of there,

1253
01:22:58.895 --> 01:23:01.783
that would explain a lot
unsolved mysteries :


1254
01:23:01.799 --> 01:23:05.712
Eldridge , the appearances of
Mothman in Point Pleasant ...


1255
01:23:05.732 --> 01:23:07.791
Who knows what else ?

1256
01:23:11.193 --> 01:23:14.426
- No more flashlight battery .
-Shit !


1257
01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:17.493
-Jenson , I see nothing !
- Okay . Take my hand .


1258
01:23:17.494 --> 01:23:20.414
Right. Watch where you step.
Very well .


1259
01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:24.949
We are facing the door.
Stretch your hands and sit down, there it is.


1260
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:27.119
OK .
Right.


1261
01:23:35.207 --> 01:23:36.989
It happened ...

1262
01:23:37.878 --> 01:23:39.616
What?

1263
01:23:39.637 --> 01:23:43.384
I opened the door and darkness followed me ,
like in my dream .


1264
01:23:43.411 --> 01:23:45.529
Hey , come on.
Hey , hey, hey .


1265
01:23:46.062 --> 01:23:49.062
- It was a dream , just a dream ...
- Forgive .


1266
01:23:49.089 --> 01:23:52.274
Jenson ,never get out of here!

1267
01:23:53.783 --> 01:23:55.533
Forgive me ...

1268
01:24:41.942 --> 01:24:43.976
Is the camera on?

1269
01:24:44.396 --> 01:24:46.749
- I see the light.
- Yes


1270
01:24:48.579 --> 01:24:50.301
Good .

1271
01:24:52.316 --> 01:24:54.321
I have an idea.

1272
01:24:55.472 --> 01:24:58.647
Nothing Ta- you - you again, Jenson .
Battery is spent .


1273
01:24:58.659 --> 01:25:00.245
No.

1274
01:25:01.481 --> 01:25:03.495
The portal ...

1275
01:25:05.984 --> 01:25:10.274
And what about " wormholes and
time-space continuum ... "


1276
01:25:10.286 --> 01:25:13.988
" ... and the total destruction of our
tiny human brains "?


1277
01:25:14.005 --> 01:25:16.030
That is my plan.

1278
01:25:17.013 --> 01:25:18.871
Look ...

1279
01:25:20.752 --> 01:25:22.824
You have no control ,

1280
01:25:23.563 --> 01:25:25.584
has no buttons,

1281
01:25:26.918 --> 01:25:31.300
what it means to be a fixed location,

1282
01:25:31.622 --> 01:25:33.961
or anywhere.

1283
01:25:34.642 --> 01:25:36.504
What Anywhere?

1284
01:25:36.518 --> 01:25:38.534
That's all I can think of .

1285
01:25:39.865 --> 01:25:42.369
But what if ...

1286
01:25:42.385 --> 01:25:44.282
... you imagine a place ...

1287
01:25:44.292 --> 01:25:46.464
... clearly in your mind ,

1288
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:51.140
and focus , and you there ?

1289
01:25:52.535 --> 01:25:56.204
You can only think that there is no place
like home. Simple as that.


1290
01:25:56.215 --> 01:25:58.221
Simple as that.

1291
01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:04.671
Did not finish
fused with the mountains?


1292
01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.136
I do not know .
I hope not.


1293
01:26:12.509 --> 01:26:14.586
We will die here , Jenson .

1294
01:26:20.511 --> 01:26:22.547
Is this ...

1295
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:25.875
or them.

1296
01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:31.718
OK .

1297
01:26:32.318 --> 01:26:34.376
What do we do ?

1298
01:26:37.386 --> 01:26:40.135
Just a guess ,

1299
01:26:42.133 --> 01:26:47.875
but there must be a place
fresh in your memory ,


1300
01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.158
Somewhere nearby ,

1301
01:26:50.174 --> 01:26:54.085
a place you can remember in detail.

1302
01:26:54.106 --> 01:26:56.368
The exterior of the mountain.

1303
01:26:58.284 --> 01:27:00.353
? The other side of the door?

1304
01:27:00.354 --> 01:27:02.820
It is one of the most
fresh in my mind ,


1305
01:27:02.842 --> 01:27:05.298
and now that the door is closed ,

1306
01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:08.450
protect us from those things , right?

1307
01:27:13.999 --> 01:27:15.775
OK .

1308
01:27:16.527 --> 01:27:18.307
OK .

1309
01:27:48.909 --> 01:27:50.923
I have fear.

1310
01:28:00.219 --> 01:28:06.411
"All is well , and everyone
should do what you are doing . "


1311
01:28:07.276 --> 01:28:09.150
Where is that?

1312
01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:11.514
" Slaughterhouse 5" .

1313
01:28:13.256 --> 01:28:15.339
Never read it .

1314
01:28:19.228 --> 01:28:21.250
Do not let go .

1315
01:28:49.489 --> 01:28:51.558
Other bodies.

1316
01:28:56.941 --> 01:28:58.979
Vallik !

1317
01:28:59.005 --> 01:29:03.075
But I found all the tourists !
Who are these ?


1318
01:29:03.434 --> 01:29:05.441
-Stay away !
-You heard ! Get away !


1319
01:29:05.442 --> 01:29:07.624
-Wait !
-We did nothing !


1320
01:29:07.647 --> 01:29:11.221
- Just want to help ...
- Okay .


1321
01:29:11.232 --> 01:29:19.120
The Army said here quarantine
to discover what happened.


1322
01:29:19.121 --> 01:29:23.031
Return to the city to the other ,
please .


1323
01:29:23.032 --> 01:29:25.101
-Get out !
- OK .


1324
01:29:34.397 --> 01:29:36.662
What are they doing ?

1325
01:29:36.685 --> 01:29:40.681
How to find out what happened
if you are taking it?


1326
01:29:40.682 --> 01:29:42.689
-Come on, Alya !
- Hear ...


1327
01:29:42.705 --> 01:29:46.456
He knows what is best for you
The situation now is under military control .


1328
01:29:46.475 --> 01:29:49.806
I do not even
know who they are !

1329
01:30:23.866 --> 01:30:25.875
Rest .

1330
01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:37.157
To the left.

1331
01:30:43.912 --> 01:30:45.915
Rest .

1332
01:30:57.563 --> 01:31:01.108
- What are you doing ?
- We put them with the others.


1333
01:31:01.131 --> 01:31:04.936
No, no. Dr. Miktenko
all want to see .

1334
01:31:04.955 --> 01:31:10.082
- Post them apart.
- Why? They are equal to each other.


1335
01:31:10.115 --> 01:31:12.124
Come, come !

1336
01:31:35.162 --> 01:31:37.348
Look at those clothes.

1337
01:31:37.366 --> 01:31:40.121
I never saw anything
like that in my life.

1338
01:31:44.482 --> 01:31:46.863
Save them . Quick, quick !

1339
01:31:46.864 --> 01:31:48.935
Very well .

1340
01:31:54.277 --> 01:31:56.332
Hang them on the hooks !

1341
01:32:15.594 --> 01:32:18.358
- Who are they ?
- Perhaps Dyatlov group .


1342
01:32:18.379 --> 01:32:21.567
- They made a mistake in coming here .
- It does not matter ,


1343
01:32:21.586 --> 01:32:25.613
Let's get out of here .

1344
01:32:27.294 --> 01:32:30.979
I hate this place .
It gives me chills .


1345
01:33:00.785 --> 01:33:03.880
In 2013 , the main
scientists worldwide


1346
01:33:03.881 --> 01:33:07.969
are still unable to explain what
Dyatlov happened to the original group .


1347
01:33:08.997 --> 01:33:12.798
But some believe that
the answers are there,


1348
01:33:12.812 --> 01:33:17.175
buried under the snow and rock,
waiting to be found ...


1349
01:33:17.930 --> 01:33:21.005
