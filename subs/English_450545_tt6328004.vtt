2
00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:58.753
Oh my goodness

3
00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:00.955
You know what this sounds like?
It's majestic.


4
00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:03.258
You ever hear of Carmina Burana?

5
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.994
Hello? Earth to Twitter
McInstagram. Come in!


6
00:02:06.027 --> 00:02:08.863
Oh, uh. Sorry.
What?


7
00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:11.232
Carmina Burana. It's like an
opera, you know.


8
00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:13.201
Bah, bah, bah, bum!

9
00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:18.007
It's hard to sing with the Christmas stuff
playing, but it's by some German guy named Orb.


10
00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:20.108
Orff.

11
00:02:20.142 --> 00:02:20.575
What?

12
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.212
Off. His name is
Carl Orff.


13
00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.715
Karloff? No, he was an actor -
in Dracula.


14
00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.183
No, the Mummy.

15
00:02:29.217 --> 00:02:29.750
What?

16
00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.720
I know the piece of
music!


17
00:02:32.754 --> 00:02:35.958
Yeah, so - it's about these
degenerate monks buggering each other.


18
00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:38.660
Ain't that something? Ha Ha!

19
00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:43.999
Uh, huh. Thanks for
the lift, Uncle Carter.


20
00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:45.301
You got it, kiddo!

21
00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:47.302
Fuckin' Germans huh?

22
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.640
But they did make the trains run
on time!


23
00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.074
Yes sir!

24
00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:59.748
Humph!

25
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.575
Yeah, that's what it looks like!

26
00:03:26.607 --> 00:03:30.312
I saw three ships come sailing
in on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day.


27
00:03:30.344 --> 00:03:32.380
That's what it looks
like to be a man


28
00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:35.951
on Christmas Day in the morning.
Balls deep! Woo!


29
00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:39.987
Jesus, honey, could you please
not jerk up like that?


30
00:03:40.022 --> 00:03:44.993
I I'm sorry baby, it's just the Christmas spirit
is hitting me. It's making me so fucking hard!


31
00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:47.963
I know, I just don't want it to
pierce the back of my throat, okay?


32
00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:53.235
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just-ya know come
on, this is my favorite part.


33
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.072
Oh, they sailed into Bethlehem
on Christmas day, on Christmas day.


34
00:03:58.106 --> 00:03:59.842
Sing it with me, Baby!

35
00:03:59.874 --> 00:04:03.411
On Christmas day, in the
morning. Harmonize!


36
00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:12.053
Humph!

37
00:05:02.102 --> 00:05:03.237
Oh my God-we're late!

38
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:05.807
Oh my God! I'll give you $20 if
you just take a breath.


39
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.210
She gets like crazy about
lateness.


40
00:05:08.242 --> 00:05:10.879
Says I'm wasting her life. Same
way I'm wasting mine.


41
00:05:10.912 --> 00:05:11.913
Do I hear forty?

42
00:05:11.946 --> 00:05:14.048
It's the smallest poison dart in
her arsenal.


43
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:15.983
Sixty.

44
00:05:16.018 --> 00:05:19.188
You don't understand. She is one of those women
who won't admit I'm her child in public.


45
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.523
Because how could she have a child may age.
I mean she actually believes it


46
00:05:22.557 --> 00:05:25.127
when somebody says we look like
sisters.


47
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.998
A hundred. I'll give you a hundred
dollars, if you just take a breath.


48
00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:33.100
Ya see that?

49
00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:34.836
It felt really good, didn't it?
You're a hundred dollars richer now.


50
00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:37.271
I worked really hard on this,
Ty.


51
00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:38.506
I know.

52
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.878
Getting everybody there and the
Secret Santa bullshit and...


53
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.482
I just I want it to be

54
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:48.884
Perfect.

55
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:54.824
You know, I want everybody to
get out of their own way and...


56
00:05:55.124 --> 00:05:59.061
Be better.

57
00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:03.598
Look, you're doing the right thing, getting
everyone together like this, you are.


58
00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:09.103
And the Secret Santa stuff, but,
you can't save them from themselves sweets.


59
00:06:09.571 --> 00:06:11.607
You can only do that for
yourself.


60
00:06:15.076 --> 00:06:16.578
I should let go.

61
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.980
Uh-hum

62
00:06:19.014 --> 00:06:21.283
Maybe if I could just help
Penny!?


63
00:06:34.162 --> 00:06:35.998
Fuckin' Christmas

64
00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:05.059
Fuck!

65
00:07:05.093 --> 00:07:06.528
We're the first ones.

66
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:07.529
Why is that a bad thing?

67
00:07:07.562 --> 00:07:09.131
Oh. She'll be livid.

68
00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:10.598
No one else is on time.

69
00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:12.968
There won't be anyone to split
her fury with.


70
00:07:13.468 --> 00:07:15.136
What about that truck down
there?


71
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.208
Caterers. She's been feasting on them
all day. There's no meat on those bones.


72
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.177
Okay, April. Remember what we
talked about in the car?


73
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:25.514
I'm gonna ask for that hundred back
and if you don't change your tune


74
00:07:25.547 --> 00:07:28.215
Oh, my little Rainy Day girl!

75
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:29.083
Hi, Mom.

76
00:07:29.117 --> 00:07:31.386
Mom? It thought this was your
sister.


77
00:07:31.987 --> 00:07:34.356
Ha! And who is this handsome
fella?


78
00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:36.158
This is Ty, Mom.

79
00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:40.428
The guy I told you about the
last nine months?


80
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:44.365
Uggh. Well April I mean, well, who can
keep up with you and all your suitors?


81
00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:46.634
Ouch. Little darty out here.

82
00:07:47.002 --> 00:07:48.670
So nice to meet you.

83
00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:50.438
It's it's just a pleasure to
meet you, Mrs. Pope.


84
00:07:50.472 --> 00:07:54.977
Oh please. Mrs. Pope is that shriveled up
beast I was forced to call my mother-in-law.


85
00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:56.010
Nana?

86
00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:57.511
Like she ever cared about you!?

87
00:07:57.545 --> 00:08:00.215
Funny, she was late for
everything too.


88
00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:02.183
Must be where my children get
it.


89
00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:05.052
But you Ty, you just call me
Shari.


90
00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:07.288
Absolutely, Shari.

91
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:10.257
Well come on in, your gonna catch your
death, let's get you to your rooms.


92
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.461
- Yeah, okay.
- You are such a lawyer.


93
00:08:12.494 --> 00:08:14.463
Whatever you say there, Rainy
Day.


94
00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:17.365
Here we are!

95
00:08:17.398 --> 00:08:21.069
But Mom, isn't this the room
with the bunkbeds?


96
00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:25.674
Well, we are a full house tonight.
Otherwise I'd give you separate bedrooms.


97
00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:29.211
But I'm sure Ty here will follow
the house rules, won't you dear?


98
00:08:29.244 --> 00:08:32.247
Oh absolutely, Mrs. Shari.

99
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.486
Oh well, he is a treasure. Let's hope you
can keep your hands on this one, Rainy.


100
00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:42.456
Well, I'll let you unpack, but don't
dilly-dally because I'm serving the crudité


101
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.725
and my famous punch the moment
the others arrive.


102
00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:45.393
Great. Thank you.

103
00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:52.134
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I definitely
felt those.


104
00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:53.435
- Do you see what I mean??
- Wow.


105
00:09:23.664 --> 00:09:27.101
She is like a porcupine.
I'm twenty-nine, she puts us in bunkbeds!


106
00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:31.139
Hey, look, this could be fun. We could build a
fort, we could play cowboy and Indian princess.


107
00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:33.508
I could attack in the middle of
the night...


108
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:35.710
steal your land so to speak.

109
00:09:35.743 --> 00:09:37.579
And why is she telling me about
the fucking punch?


110
00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:39.313
This whole night is gonna blow
up in my damn face...


111
00:09:39.346 --> 00:09:41.649
Hey. No it's not. It's gonna
be great.


112
00:09:41.682 --> 00:09:43.851
How you think she's gonna react when
“He Who Shant Be Named” gets here?


113
00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:44.919
Hey, hey.

114
00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:48.390
Your lawyer's here. So,
I'll take the heat for this whole thing,


115
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:50.691
you can tell everyone it was my
idea in the first place, okay?


116
00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:53.796
Well it kinda was, wasn't it?

117
00:09:54.495 --> 00:10:00.802
And I might be able to get us a better
deal on this bunkbed situation. Okay?


118
00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:06.273
Sweetheart, come, I've just
poured you some punch.


119
00:10:06.307 --> 00:10:06.808
I'll pass.

120
00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:08.342
Come on now-really?

121
00:10:08.376 --> 00:10:10.811
Can you believe she's still on
that AA kick?


122
00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:13.447
No! You're still acting like
you're an alcoholic?


123
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.349
It's not an act.

124
00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:17.219
Ty, my aunt, Carol Taper.

125
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:18.686
Klein. It's Klein, dear.

126
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.553
When did that happen?

127
00:10:19.587 --> 00:10:22.323
In June. Marvin and I eloped.
Paris.


128
00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:24.792
Oh, Paris. It's magical.

129
00:10:24.826 --> 00:10:26.461
Why didn't you tell me?

130
00:10:26.494 --> 00:10:29.431
Well, you're so busy climbing your steps,
who knows where you are half the time.


131
00:10:33.902 --> 00:10:37.571
Oh Ty, please tell me you're not
going to be drinking Pepsi all night.


132
00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:38.840
Ummm, uhh

133
00:10:38.873 --> 00:10:42.311
Oh, I see Mother may he?

134
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.879
He can do whatever he wants.

135
00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:45.314
Terrific. Ty?

136
00:10:46.047 --> 00:10:48.517
Yeah. Absolutely! Sure, I'll try
some of that, thank you.


137
00:10:48.549 --> 00:10:50.484
You are most welcome, handsome.

138
00:10:50.518 --> 00:10:53.220
Hands off, Mrs. Robinson-he's
taken.


139
00:10:53.254 --> 00:10:55.523
Oh, pffft. Oh I almost forgot

140
00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:58.726
Oh mom, not this again!

141
00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:59.927
Cellphones!

142
00:10:59.961 --> 00:11:00.928
Come on, come on!

143
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:02.429
Holiday rules.

144
00:11:02.462 --> 00:11:03.798
No Cellphones on Christmas Eve.

145
00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:06.334
Really? OK here ya go.

146
00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:07.534
Hey, sis!

147
00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:11.505
Kyle! It's so good to see you.
When did you get here?


148
00:11:11.538 --> 00:11:12.340
About ten

149
00:11:12.373 --> 00:11:13.908
About ten minutes
ago!


150
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:15.943
Everyone else is in their rooms.

151
00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:16.610
Everyone?

152
00:11:17.946 --> 00:11:21.316
Well sweetheart what do you expect when you lock
yourself away with gorgeous here for an age?


153
00:11:21.349 --> 00:11:22.450
We were just getting set

154
00:11:22.484 --> 00:11:24.519
Oh dear, we know
what you were getting


155
00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:25.887
Oh, my God

156
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.860
So did you come up alone?

157
00:11:31.893 --> 00:11:32.761
Uh, no, Uncle

158
00:11:32.793 --> 00:11:34.228
Uncle Carter
drove him.


159
00:11:34.262 --> 00:11:36.364
You know what Mom, you don't need
to speak for him every time somebody


160
00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:39.466
My goodness!

161
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.536
Do those people have any idea
how expensive those are?


162
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.273
This is what happens when you let
your children pick the caterer.


163
00:11:45.306 --> 00:11:49.311
Well, I suggested them because
they're really good on Yelp and they


164
00:11:49.344 --> 00:11:51.446
I know. You've
said.


165
00:11:52.013 --> 00:11:54.182
So, who else is here?

166
00:11:54.215 --> 00:12:02.490
Uh, I think Penny got here a few minutes
before us. And, oh Jack's here and he brought a date.


167
00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:03.658
Oh my God, of course he did.

168
00:12:03.691 --> 00:12:06.494
Sure did. Wait'll you see what
that cat dragged in.


169
00:12:06.527 --> 00:12:12.734
Bunk beds not gonna slow this elf from making
toys for all the naughty girls and boys, no sir!


170
00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:15.869
I don't know,
thought she was a pretty nice girl.


171
00:12:15.903 --> 00:12:19.673
Oh Holy night!

172
00:12:19.706 --> 00:12:23.979
Oh it's Christmas time in the
mountains


173
00:12:24.012 --> 00:12:28.416
plowing a bitch I met a month
ago.


174
00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:31.619
Dear diary, best Christmas ever!

175
00:12:31.653 --> 00:12:36.324
You men all think that type is nice. Slutty
with a hot body and perky, gravity defying


176
00:12:36.356 --> 00:12:37.891
Talking about me again, Aunt
Carol?


177
00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:39.527
Penny!

178
00:12:40.028 --> 00:12:41.396
Hi!

179
00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:43.831
Jesus, April, what, do you need
a kidney?


180
00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:47.302
No! I'm just happy to see you!

181
00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:48.302
Why?

182
00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:51.306
‘Cause. You're my sister.

183
00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:52.640
How are you?

184
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:55.677
Oh. Great.

185
00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:02.283
They just gave me a raise at work. I'm dating a Hemsworth
and I've got a yeast infection that's making pee fire.


186
00:13:04.018 --> 00:13:06.455
Now one of those things is true.
Guess?


187
00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:12.794
Hey-you must be Penny.

188
00:13:12.826 --> 00:13:14.696
April's told me so much about
you.


189
00:13:15.763 --> 00:13:16.665
Why?

190
00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:18.465
What?

191
00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:19.267
Who are you?

192
00:13:19.734 --> 00:13:22.870
Ha. I'm so sorry. I'm Ty. I'm
April's boyfriend.


193
00:13:24.605 --> 00:13:25.606
‘Course you are.

194
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:28.976
Hey my wiggers! 
How you living!?

195
00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:30.378
Jackson hi I've missed you.

196
00:13:30.411 --> 00:13:33.014
Wow, little sis, you are fit!

197
00:13:33.047 --> 00:13:34.215
Have you been working out?
Dayum!


198
00:13:34.248 --> 00:13:38.920
Yeah I have. That and not
drinking myself into a stupor.


199
00:13:38.952 --> 00:13:43.924
Hold on there now peach pit. Where do you think
you're going without giving your bro some sugar!?


200
00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:45.326
Half-brother!

201
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.998
Oh, I may be your half brother,
but you are all woman! Oh Love it!


202
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:51.566
Ok down boy.

203
00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:53.435
And who is this?

204
00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:55.937
Oh I'm sorry. I'm Ty. You must
be Jackson.


205
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.339
I must.

206
00:13:57.571 --> 00:13:58.773
And who's this lovely lady?

207
00:13:58.806 --> 00:14:00.975
Oh you mean “Her Royal Hotness”?

208
00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:03.078
Jackson, don't be vulgar.

209
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.448
Apologies Carol. Everyone this
is Jacqueline.


210
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:09.583
Jacqueline this is, you know,
everybody.


211
00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:10.951
Hi everybody.

212
00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:13.487
Um Jackson, I need to use the
restroom.


213
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:13.954
Ok

214
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.891
It's just down the hall.

215
00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:22.429
No, Uncle Carter's been
destroying that one for the last twenty minutes.


216
00:14:22.462 --> 00:14:25.099
Use the Master Bath-upstairs.

217
00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:26.501
Great, thanks.

218
00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:31.038
Mom is gonna go nuts when she finds
out Jack's girl used her bathroom.


219
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.774
I know.

220
00:14:33.407 --> 00:14:36.878
Well I think that's everyone so
who needs a drink?


221
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:38.646
Well I guess you'll be needing
one.


222
00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:41.415
Pop!? Dad? Daddy?!?

223
00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:43.084
What the hell are you doing
here!?


224
00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:44.719
Nice to see you too, Shar.

225
00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:47.889
Don't you cause a scene, Leonard.
Christmas is not your holiday!


226
00:14:47.922 --> 00:14:49.389
I know it isn't and I think that
sucks.


227
00:14:49.423 --> 00:14:52.927
Well too bad. I knew time-sharing this
house with you would be impossible.


228
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.528
I wanna spend Christmas with my
family too.


229
00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:57.898
Well you should've thought about that
before you started fucking Cathy Stewart.


230
00:14:57.932 --> 00:15:01.635
You sure you wanna go toe to toe about
who fucked who and how many times?


231
00:15:01.668 --> 00:15:03.370
I'm not doing this with you
again.


232
00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:07.040
And what the hell is Jackson doing here?
He's my son-he's just your step-son.


233
00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:07.974
I'm calling the police.

234
00:15:08.009 --> 00:15:10.144
You wanna do that to our kids,
go ahead.


235
00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:12.047
But I kinda think they want me
here.


236
00:15:13.214 --> 00:15:16.852
Come on, Shar. It's our wedding
anniversary, for Christ's sake.


237
00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:20.555
It's one of the best times of our life.
And look at everything we've created.


238
00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:23.521
Mmmmm. Still the master
manipulator huh?


239
00:15:23.523 --> 00:15:26.061
Been indicted for bribing anyone
at the FDA lately?


240
00:15:26.728 --> 00:15:32.567
OK I'm going inside. You wanna call the
cops, call the cops. Be the bad guy.


241
00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:36.970
But you'll be ruining your own party and
causing more of a scene than we already have.


242
00:15:37.004 --> 00:15:40.609
And I know how you feel about
causing a scene, Shar.


243
00:15:44.946 --> 00:15:47.581
Merry Christmas, Everyone!

244
00:15:48.582 --> 00:15:49.083
Shit.

245
00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:50.585
Hey pop!

246
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.490
I've decided to ask your father
to join us for dinner.


247
00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:58.192
Well that's real big of you,
Shar. Thanks.


248
00:15:58.225 --> 00:16:00.494
Uh, Daddy?

249
00:16:00.528 --> 00:16:01.629
Uh, Len, your phone.

250
00:16:01.662 --> 00:16:03.098
Seriously?

251
00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:05.699
Great doing business with you.

252
00:16:08.802 --> 00:16:09.970
Why are you here?

253
00:16:10.004 --> 00:16:11.538
Because I wanna be with you.

254
00:16:11.906 --> 00:16:17.512
And because I don't want your mother to win and
control this holiday for the rest of my life.


255
00:16:20.514 --> 00:16:22.116
Who hasn't gotten punch!?

256
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.784
Thank you, Carol!

257
00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:31.658
She's cute.

258
00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:32.726
What?

259
00:16:32.993 --> 00:16:38.766
Oh, oh, yeah. I
guess. Hey dad.


260
00:16:38.798 --> 00:16:39.934
Hey son.

261
00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:43.538
So. How'd the interview go?

262
00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:45.606
Uh, it went great,
Dad.


263
00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:46.874
That's not what I heard.

264
00:16:47.674 --> 00:16:51.045
Can we not do this
now?


265
00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:52.747
Sure.

266
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:02.957
That went better than expected.

267
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.759
Didn't call the cops. Least for
now.


268
00:17:07.794 --> 00:17:10.064
Thanks for inviting me. Want
some punch.


269
00:17:11.132 --> 00:17:14.302
Oh shit I'm sorry I forgot-I
totally forgot about that.


270
00:17:14.335 --> 00:17:17.872
Want me... I'll get you
something diff...


271
00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:20.607
You want I should get you a
'Bottie'?


272
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.942
Oh, that's my punch!

273
00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:27.883
Ugh. You should thank me. It
tastes like shit.


274
00:17:40.961 --> 00:17:42.763
You in
here?


275
00:17:46.334 --> 00:17:47.369
Shhhh

276
00:17:47.402 --> 00:17:51.639
- Oh fuck this!
- Oh fuck this!


277
00:17:51.672 --> 00:17:52.774
Oh! Oh!

278
00:17:52.807 --> 00:17:53.708
Ahh! Ouch!

279
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.275
Oh sorry.

280
00:17:54.307 --> 00:17:55.609
Seriously?

281
00:17:55.643 --> 00:17:56.678
Sorry man.

282
00:17:56.711 --> 00:17:59.580
Gonna do a
Christmas drive-by Tupac?


283
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.116
We should have
stayed in L.A.


284
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.320
Calm the fuck down, they'll be
cool that I'm black.


285
00:18:05.353 --> 00:18:09.090
Oh my God, they
don't even know that I'm gay!


286
00:18:09.123 --> 00:18:12.093
But you are. Very

287
00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:21.635
Shhhh

288
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:23.772
Can I can I watch, please?

289
00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:28.743
Owww! No teeth! No teeth!

290
00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:30.345
‘Cause you were thinking,
with...


291
00:18:30.377 --> 00:18:32.746
Figs with ricotta, pistachio and
honey?


292
00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:34.281
Oh of course. Thank you so much.

293
00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:37.785
One moment. Uh what is this?

294
00:18:37.817 --> 00:18:39.287
Figs with ricotta, pistachio and
honey


295
00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:42.123
I know what it is. Why is the
ricotta on the top?


296
00:18:42.155 --> 00:18:44.791
Because you couldn't pick it up
if it was at the bottom.


297
00:18:44.825 --> 00:18:46.928
There was to be a puff pastry on
the bottom.


298
00:18:46.961 --> 00:18:48.128
Yes mam but Chef Gordon

299
00:18:48.162 --> 00:18:51.199
I DON'T care what Chef Gordon
thought.


300
00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:56.303
Oh my God. It's like the best bite of food I've
ever had in my life. I mean, it's so light!


301
00:18:56.336 --> 00:18:59.206
Shari, stop hogging the figs,
I'd like to try one.


302
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.342
Uh thank you.

303
00:19:00.741 --> 00:19:02.844
I'll serve my guests.

304
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:05.078
These are just luscious!

305
00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:08.850
It's something I came up with and
talked to the chef about in there.


306
00:19:08.883 --> 00:19:11.686
He wanted to load them down with
a puff pastry.


307
00:19:11.719 --> 00:19:16.290
Wooow! I was bound up something
fierce! Ugh!


308
00:19:16.591 --> 00:19:19.094
Oh good, hors d'oeuvres! I'm
empty!


309
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.065
Carter! Use a ladle!

310
00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:28.369
Oh sorry.

311
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.673
Mmm! Those figs tasty! When's
dinner?


312
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.308
Oh for God's sake.

313
00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:37.045
Wanna cool it on the bathroom
breaks?


314
00:19:37.077 --> 00:19:38.413
- Got it, Chef
- Grab a dish for the beans


315
00:19:38.445 --> 00:19:39.380
Sorry Chef.

316
00:19:39.413 --> 00:19:42.383
Hey, so did Madame like her
puff-less figs?


317
00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:43.049
Inte först.

318
00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:45.353
In English girl, in English.

319
00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:49.990
Oh sorry. Not at first, but then Cpt. Handsome over there
loved them so she took credit for eighty-sixing the pastry.


320
00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:51.893
Java fitter!

321
00:19:52.692 --> 00:19:55.430
You got that right, brother. I
think.


322
00:19:55.462 --> 00:19:59.800
OK, let's see if she likes
this!


323
00:19:59.834 --> 00:20:01.302
That turkey smells devine.

324
00:20:01.335 --> 00:20:04.404
Well it should. I woke up at six
this morning to make it.


325
00:20:04.438 --> 00:20:09.210
And then I slaved in that kitchen all day.
I mean that cook in there is just serving.


326
00:20:09.242 --> 00:20:10.845
Oh God, I hope this works.

327
00:20:10.877 --> 00:20:11.979
It will.

328
00:20:12.012 --> 00:20:14.281
I just got to keep it together
till the gift exchange.


329
00:20:14.848 --> 00:20:18.852
Okay, deep breath. Hey, can you
introduce me to your dad?


330
00:20:19.053 --> 00:20:22.056
Yes. Can you just calm calm
down for a second?


331
00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:25.326
What? Am I getting a little
carried away?


332
00:20:25.358 --> 00:20:27.227
I don't know where he is at the
moment.


333
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.762
I'll introduce you.

334
00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:30.365
Sorry. Ok.

335
00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:32.499
It's good. Why are you nervous?

336
00:20:32.532 --> 00:20:33.834
Who's nervous? I'm nervous?

337
00:20:33.867 --> 00:20:37.971
Did you know you can tell a
turkey's gender by it's poop?


338
00:20:38.005 --> 00:20:42.343
Males take circular craps and the
girls make sort of a “j” shaped poop.


339
00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:43.310
Ugh

340
00:20:56.323 --> 00:21:00.428
What? Am I popping out again?

341
00:21:00.461 --> 00:21:02.931
No dear. You're fine.

342
00:21:03.631 --> 00:21:08.136
I really didn't think I would need to
explain, but could you please all respect


343
00:21:08.169 --> 00:21:10.939
that the Master Suite is off
limits!


344
00:21:13.274 --> 00:21:15.476
Ladies and Gentlemen. Please
take your seats.


345
00:21:15.509 --> 00:21:18.046
Dinner will be served.
Presently.


346
00:21:21.015 --> 00:21:24.384
Whoever heard of the help announcing
when the dinner will be served?


347
00:21:27.253 --> 00:21:29.990
Someone telling the Hydra when
dinner will be served?


348
00:21:30.024 --> 00:21:31.292
This'll be good!

349
00:21:31.325 --> 00:21:33.494
Dad, this is my boyfriend, Ty.

350
00:21:33.527 --> 00:21:35.263
It's fantastic to meet you, Mr.
Pope.


351
00:21:35.296 --> 00:21:36.497
Good to meet you. Ty?

352
00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:43.303
Now look! I don't know how you think you are, but I
slaved over that bird, and I'll say when to serve it.


353
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:50.344
Yes, ma'am. I just thought since I was not
told about the figs that you “slaved” over,


354
00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:52.880
that it was still dealer's
choice with dinner.


355
00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:57.084
Just bring the sides. I'll
handle the turkey.


356
00:21:57.285 --> 00:22:00.488
I would be happy to “give you
the bird” ma'am.


357
00:22:25.378 --> 00:22:28.248
Here comes the big presentation.

358
00:22:28.281 --> 00:22:29.649
Of what?

359
00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:33.520
Ladies and Gentlemen.
May I present Shari Pope's famous turkey.


360
00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:13.060
Well I guess you're all wondering
why I called you all here tonight?


361
00:23:13.093 --> 00:23:15.496
Come on everybody.
Mangia, mangia!


362
00:23:15.528 --> 00:23:16.630
Bon Appetit!

363
00:23:16.663 --> 00:23:20.367
I would hate for this exquisite
meal I made to get cold.


364
00:23:20.401 --> 00:23:26.207
You know I read the average holiday meal has over forty-five
hundred calories and over two hundred grams of fat.


365
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.374
But

366
00:23:28.308 --> 00:23:30.010
This looks terrific.

367
00:23:30.044 --> 00:23:32.480
It's been a heck of a year in
the pharmaceuticals game.


368
00:23:32.512 --> 00:23:35.916
I mean we've recorded record
profits four quarters in a row.


369
00:23:36.316 --> 00:23:38.618
Yeah, I been reading about that
class action suit, Leo.


370
00:23:38.652 --> 00:23:40.386
That sounds like a real mess.

371
00:23:40.421 --> 00:23:44.259
Sounds like your legal team ain't gonna be
able to make that go away like in the '90's,


372
00:23:44.558 --> 00:23:47.694
That's why we're shit-canning
those motherfucking,


373
00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:48.461
cocksucking,

374
00:23:48.495 --> 00:23:49.497
cunt-singing,

375
00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:50.163
tiny-ass,

376
00:23:50.198 --> 00:23:51.666
fucking little, shit-faced,

377
00:23:51.699 --> 00:23:53.534
piss-ass, lawyer fucks!

378
00:23:57.337 --> 00:23:59.440
I'm sorry.

379
00:23:59.672 --> 00:24:02.477
I don't know where that came from.
I shouldn't have said that.


380
00:24:02.844 --> 00:24:06.247
Can we just keep it between
ourselves?


381
00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:08.415
Yeah. Suuure.

382
00:24:08.449 --> 00:24:12.420
Absolutely Mr. Pope. Whatever you say, I want to assure
you that it doesn't go any further than my ears.


383
00:24:15.455 --> 00:24:17.958
So how long have
you two been dating?


384
00:24:17.991 --> 00:24:18.826
Two months.

385
00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:20.527
And where did you
meet?


386
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.929
Restaurant. Strip Club.

387
00:24:24.163 --> 00:24:27.268
It was like a dance place where
people take their pants off


388
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.569
Does anybody else feel like it's
hot in here?


389
00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.750
Just once a year, you couldn't
eat a real meal with your family?


390
00:24:43.784 --> 00:24:47.054
This is a real meal, Mother. And
I'm eating it with my family.


391
00:24:47.086 --> 00:24:50.023
You know what I mean. Have some
of my turkey. It's exquisite.


392
00:24:50.057 --> 00:24:51.158
You know I'm allergic.

393
00:24:51.191 --> 00:24:52.192
It's all in your head!

394
00:24:52.226 --> 00:24:54.128
How can you say that?

395
00:24:54.162 --> 00:24:57.498
I missed going to Europe with the Chorphenians in
high school because they thought I had leprosy.


396
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.932
It was just hives!

397
00:24:58.966 --> 00:25:02.570
That I got because the kids at
school tricked me into eating turkey.


398
00:25:02.603 --> 00:25:04.270
That was unfounded.

399
00:25:04.304 --> 00:25:07.074
April's cheerleader friends were
completely innocent of that.


400
00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:10.344
Course you would think so.
How could pretty girls do horrible things?


401
00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:14.080
You just have it out for anyone
who's beautiful. Why is that?


402
00:25:14.114 --> 00:25:15.649
Because they poisoned me!

403
00:25:15.682 --> 00:25:20.086
That is not true. You were just a
nervous child, and you didn't want to go.


404
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.655
I'd been training my whole life
to go.


405
00:25:21.688 --> 00:25:23.557
You had a fear of success dear.

406
00:25:23.589 --> 00:25:25.224
This is what she does.

407
00:25:25.259 --> 00:25:27.795
She denies there's a problem because of
her need for all of us to be perfect.


408
00:25:27.827 --> 00:25:28.995
Oh don't you start!

409
00:25:29.028 --> 00:25:31.664
One daughter who won't eat. The
other who won't drink!


410
00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:32.666
Because I'm an alcoholic.

411
00:25:32.699 --> 00:25:35.068
I do not like that word and no
you're not!


412
00:25:35.102 --> 00:25:35.703
Yes I am.

413
00:25:35.736 --> 00:25:37.505
How do you know?

414
00:25:37.538 --> 00:25:40.341
Because when I drink I get mean and hurt the
people I love. When I drink I become an asshole.


415
00:25:40.374 --> 00:25:43.243
Well you're not drinking now, so
what's your excuse!?


416
00:25:43.277 --> 00:25:44.745
OK this is getting out of hand!

417
00:25:44.778 --> 00:25:46.547
Oh so I'm the bad guy!?

418
00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:51.384
I suffer and work til my bones ache, to give
these children everything and look what I get!


419
00:25:51.418 --> 00:25:54.388
One daughter who stops drinking
and becomes meaner than a hornet.


420
00:25:54.421 --> 00:25:58.491
And the other one who stops eating
and is still as fat as a house!


421
00:26:06.099 --> 00:26:08.602
I don't know why I said that.

422
00:26:09.002 --> 00:26:12.172
My pretty face not making up for
it anymore, mom?


423
00:26:12.373 --> 00:26:17.545
No, Penny. You do have a pretty
face.


424
00:26:22.249 --> 00:26:25.385
Hey I have an idea. Why don't we
play Secret Santa?


425
00:26:25.419 --> 00:26:26.420
I second that idea.

426
00:26:26.453 --> 00:26:28.621
But we haven't had the
deserts yet!


427
00:26:28.654 --> 00:26:31.191
We can have them when we play.
How's that sound?


428
00:26:31.224 --> 00:26:32.125
I think that sounds nice.

429
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.162
I'm with my lady. Let's do it,
Shar.


430
00:26:35.162 --> 00:26:36.564
Ok.

431
00:26:48.875 --> 00:26:51.612
And our first contestant is

432
00:26:52.813 --> 00:26:54.282
Jackson!

433
00:26:55.414 --> 00:26:56.483
Here you go Jacks.

434
00:26:56.517 --> 00:26:59.186
And this is for you, Jacqueline.

435
00:26:59.219 --> 00:26:59.952
Really?

436
00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:03.790
Oh I didn't know, we just
brought wine for everybody.


437
00:27:03.824 --> 00:27:06.293
Oh that's ok baby. See this is
the way it works.


438
00:27:06.326 --> 00:27:08.327
Everyone in the family gets the
name of someone else in the family.


439
00:27:08.362 --> 00:27:12.800
That's who you have to buy for and if you bring
someone then you have to get a gift for them too.


440
00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:14.335
Oh that's why you only

441
00:27:14.367 --> 00:27:16.302
No, no, no, no!

442
00:27:16.336 --> 00:27:18.538
You don't want to
give anything away


443
00:27:18.572 --> 00:27:20.674
Kyle. Kyle. Let
Jackson tell it.


444
00:27:20.707 --> 00:27:21.642
He's doing great Shar.

445
00:27:21.674 --> 00:27:24.345
Oh I know. I know. But you tell
it so good.


446
00:27:26.313 --> 00:27:27.715
Go ahead, bro.

447
00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:35.188
OK. Well you don't want to give anything away. The fun is when
you get your gift everyone has to guess who bought it for them.


448
00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:39.527
That's the game. And whoever gets the most
right wins becomes the game master next year.


449
00:27:39.559 --> 00:27:41.261
And then they decide who gives
to who.


450
00:27:41.295 --> 00:27:42.730
And the game master doesn't get
a gift?


451
00:27:42.762 --> 00:27:45.899
No. But when you see some of the
gifts, you're usually dodging a bullet!


452
00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:48.234
That's right, I said it!

453
00:27:48.268 --> 00:27:50.437
Oh that's terrible.

454
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:54.240
What's terrible? Last year you gave me that fakakta
exercise band that told me what a lazy bastard I am.


455
00:27:54.274 --> 00:27:57.211
Oh shush you lazy bastard, you
lost 20 pounds.


456
00:27:57.243 --> 00:27:58.512
It's a book!

457
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.582
Le Chansons De Bilitis

458
00:28:01.615 --> 00:28:04.384
Oh I know this book! That's
amazing!


459
00:28:04.418 --> 00:28:06.521
Carol. Did you!?

460
00:28:09.655 --> 00:28:12.659
Ohhh. I don't know what

461
00:28:12.692 --> 00:28:14.295
It's a necklace.

462
00:28:16.496 --> 00:28:19.333
Shar, that's amazing. And the
book, thank you.


463
00:28:19.365 --> 00:28:22.268
It's a first edition in the
original French.


464
00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:23.503
I thought you'd like it.

465
00:28:23.537 --> 00:28:24.872
I love it.

466
00:28:24.904 --> 00:28:27.941
Is that the book of poems about
lesbian erotica?


467
00:28:27.974 --> 00:28:29.709
What?

468
00:28:29.743 --> 00:28:32.312
Ce que chante la corneille, chante le corneillon.

469
00:28:34.448 --> 00:28:37.685
Oh for goodness sakes. It's
simple!


470
00:28:38.152 --> 00:28:39.620
Just give it to me.

471
00:28:49.663 --> 00:28:51.832
There you go.

472
00:28:53.366 --> 00:28:55.935
Wha, what? I watch a lot of
Project Ru, Ru, Ru..


473
00:28:55.969 --> 00:28:58.672
...t, t, t, to, Top Gun

474
00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:02.242
It's lovely, Mrs. Pope. Thank
you.


475
00:29:02.276 --> 00:29:05.479
You're welcome dear. It's from
my favorite designer.


476
00:29:05.511 --> 00:29:07.313
Jacques Du Pierre

477
00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:09.516
We have early versions of the
same necklace.


478
00:29:09.548 --> 00:29:11.518
We don't know how to put them on
either.


479
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.886
I can show you how, if you wa

480
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.921
No thanks

481
00:29:14.954 --> 00:29:16.756
What's that thing you said in
French, Leonard?


482
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:19.526
Who wrote down Shari as my
Secret Santa?


483
00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:22.296
I thought it was Kyle. I don't
know what the kids are into.


484
00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:24.632
Alright, who's next?

485
00:29:24.664 --> 00:29:26.399
This is cracking me up.

486
00:29:26.432 --> 00:29:28.603
Oh, it's me!

487
00:29:29.002 --> 00:29:31.771
I guess this is all there is.

488
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.378
It's tickets.

489
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:40.514
A concert to the London Royal
Philharmonic.


490
00:29:40.547 --> 00:29:41.414
It's lovely.

491
00:29:41.448 --> 00:29:44.018
You're going to
London.


492
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.486
Well now we know it's not Kyle.

493
00:29:46.787 --> 00:29:50.024
Unless he's trying to use
subterfuge by asking a question.


494
00:29:50.057 --> 00:29:51.458
I bet it's Kyle.

495
00:29:52.489 --> 00:29:53.660
Maybe.

496
00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.628
Is it hot in here?

497
00:29:54.661 --> 00:29:57.730
Marvin does most of his work in
Europe. Banking.


498
00:29:57.763 --> 00:30:00.600
He's there now. I'm joining him
on Tuesday.


499
00:30:00.634 --> 00:30:01.835
That's why he's not here.

500
00:30:01.867 --> 00:30:04.638
Well that, and he's a Jew.

501
00:30:05.038 --> 00:30:05.740
You know.

502
00:30:06.272 --> 00:30:07.473
What's the show sis?

503
00:30:07.507 --> 00:30:08.509
Oh shit.

504
00:30:08.541 --> 00:30:10.410
Now I'm giving myself away

505
00:30:11.745 --> 00:30:13.314
Or am I?

506
00:30:13.814 --> 00:30:15.615
It's a Debussy Concert.

507
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:18.085
Debussy? What piece?

508
00:30:18.117 --> 00:30:21.922
It's one of his middle works.
Lesser known.


509
00:30:21.954 --> 00:30:23.423
Which one?

510
00:30:24.524 --> 00:30:27.728
Les Trois Chansons de Bilitis

511
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.729
Wait a second!

512
00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:30.897
That's the same as the book
Shari gave Jack.


513
00:30:30.931 --> 00:30:32.466
Is that about lesbians also?

514
00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:34.101
What the hell's going on with
you people?


515
00:30:34.134 --> 00:30:36.502
Did Shari buy for two of us!?
That's not right.


516
00:30:36.536 --> 00:30:38.839
You could almost call it
unnatural.


517
00:30:39.672 --> 00:30:43.109
Pourquoi ne l'avez-vous
pas encore baise.


518
00:30:43.143 --> 00:30:44.143
What the heck does that mean?

519
00:30:44.178 --> 00:30:46.547
It means “Why don't you fuck him
already?”


520
00:30:46.579 --> 00:30:48.415
Or is that a moot point?

521
00:30:52.586 --> 00:30:55.556
OK you know what?
Time to lighten the mood here a bit um...


522
00:30:55.588 --> 00:30:56.856
What's going on?

523
00:30:56.891 --> 00:30:59.125
What's going on is the next
person's getting their gift.


524
00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:01.362
Jack did you give those tickets
to your Aunt?


525
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:05.632
The next name is

526
00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:06.799
April.

527
00:31:06.833 --> 00:31:10.070
But she's the game master. She
doesn't get a gift.


528
00:31:10.103 --> 00:31:14.674
Well Kyle. It is my hope that I'll
be the one getting the gift tonight.


529
00:31:15.808 --> 00:31:16.844
What are you doing?

530
00:31:19.578 --> 00:31:23.884
I'm trying to spend the rest of my life with
the woman I've waited my whole life to find.


531
00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:32.492
Oh my

532
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:43.903
Pecan

533
00:31:54.681 --> 00:31:57.985
Do you... do you want to marry
me?


534
00:31:58.818 --> 00:32:03.890
For you to ask me here, tonight,
after everything you have seen.


535
00:32:03.923 --> 00:32:06.460
Hell yes, I will marry you!

536
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.446
That's awesome.

537
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.015
Life wasn't quite perfect enough
for April,


538
00:32:28.047 --> 00:32:31.884
but now that she's found Prince Caspian
here, everything's right with the world.


539
00:32:31.918 --> 00:32:34.488
You know Penny, you don't have
to shit all over your sister's


540
00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.124
Dad, don't. It's ok.

541
00:32:37.457 --> 00:32:39.760
Hey sis congrats.

542
00:32:39.793 --> 00:32:41.495
Thanks, Kyle.

543
00:32:41.528 --> 00:32:47.034
You were right, Kyle. It wasn't April's
turn. I was looking for a good opportunity.


544
00:32:47.066 --> 00:32:51.137
It's alright. Anyway. The name I
picked anyway was Penny.


545
00:32:51.538 --> 00:32:54.740
Christ sake even the stripper is
empathizing with the cheerleader?


546
00:32:54.774 --> 00:32:56.477
That's enough young lady.

547
00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:12.893
Plane tickets?

548
00:33:13.626 --> 00:33:16.095
Is she going to London to watch
lesbians too?


549
00:33:16.462 --> 00:33:17.998
Well these are tickets.

550
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:18.932
London,

551
00:33:18.964 --> 00:33:20.032
Paris,

552
00:33:20.066 --> 00:33:21.268
Berlin,

553
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.168
Barcelona

554
00:33:22.201 --> 00:33:23.837
Bar━THE-lona

555
00:33:24.104 --> 00:33:27.774
It's for a tour of Europe and
there's other tickets too


556
00:33:27.807 --> 00:33:30.844
A shit-ton of theater and opera.

557
00:33:30.876 --> 00:33:32.945
I'd be gone for over a month.

558
00:33:32.979 --> 00:33:36.884
I can't take off that much work. Who
the hell got me a trip through Europe!?


559
00:33:36.916 --> 00:33:42.255
Well it's dad's company so he's the
only one who could get you that kinda time off.


560
00:33:43.155 --> 00:33:49.062
I didn't get you the trip. I just made sure you had enough
time to take it. That call came in from someone else.


561
00:33:56.102 --> 00:33:56.937
You

562
00:33:58.572 --> 00:33:59.273
Why?

563
00:33:59.707 --> 00:34:03.210
This must be like ten grand in
plane tickets alone.


564
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:04.744
Hold the phone.

565
00:34:04.778 --> 00:34:06.880
I thought there was a three
hundred dollar limit on this deal!


566
00:34:06.913 --> 00:34:09.115
With the show tickets it's like
twelve grand.


567
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:10.017
Hotels included.

568
00:34:10.049 --> 00:34:12.251
Shit I hope you get me next
year, sis.


569
00:34:12.285 --> 00:34:14.288
You spent fifteen grand?

570
00:34:14.587 --> 00:34:16.155
And it's still not enough.

571
00:34:16.556 --> 00:34:18.259
Not for what I did.

572
00:34:19.992 --> 00:34:21.662
What did you do?

573
00:34:23.596 --> 00:34:25.999
It's what I didn't do.

574
00:34:27.066 --> 00:34:29.069
I didn't warn you.

575
00:34:31.837 --> 00:34:34.908
I knew the meatballs were made
with turkey.


576
00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:37.278
I knew you'd have a reaction.

577
00:34:37.578 --> 00:34:38.679
I knew it.

578
00:34:39.078 --> 00:34:42.716
But I wanted to sit at the cool
kids table and


579
00:34:46.352 --> 00:34:51.758
I let them steal your trip to Europe and
no I can't replace what you lost. But thats


580
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.160
This is the best its

581
00:34:55.127 --> 00:34:57.163
It's the least I could do.

582
00:34:58.765 --> 00:34:59.567
You're right.

583
00:35:01.868 --> 00:35:04.171
It is the least you could do,
you fucking bitch.


584
00:35:04.437 --> 00:35:06.973
I have had just about enough of
this!


585
00:35:07.006 --> 00:35:08.374
Enough of what!?

586
00:35:08.408 --> 00:35:11.010
Polly perfect just admitted she was
with the bitches who poisoned me.


587
00:35:11.044 --> 00:35:14.381
Oh for goodness sake. She didn't
poison you. She just did't tell you.


588
00:35:14.413 --> 00:35:16.049
Oh my fucking God!

589
00:35:16.082 --> 00:35:17.049
Please don't help mom.

590
00:35:17.082 --> 00:35:18.117
What. You're my child.

591
00:35:18.151 --> 00:35:19.653
And what am I!?

592
00:35:19.685 --> 00:35:22.955
I might not be a supermodel mom, but I
came out of your overused vagina too!


593
00:35:22.988 --> 00:35:24.057
Oh this is too much!

594
00:35:24.089 --> 00:35:24.991
It IS hot in here.

595
00:35:25.024 --> 00:35:26.693
You are an outrageous person.

596
00:35:26.727 --> 00:35:30.730
Oh I wouldn't go around throwing insults,
Jocasta, at least I'm not fucking my own son.


597
00:35:30.763 --> 00:35:32.332
- Hey.
- Shut the fuck up, Oedipus!


598
00:35:32.365 --> 00:35:33.767
Get out of my house!

599
00:35:33.799 --> 00:35:35.267
She's not going anywhere, it's
my house too!


600
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:36.303
Not tonight it isn't!

601
00:35:36.336 --> 00:35:37.971
I paid for it!

602
00:35:38.004 --> 00:35:41.107
Oh, well, if that's the standard, then I
guess Carol needs to tell her new husband


603
00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.042
That you get her tits half the
time!


604
00:35:43.075 --> 00:35:44.477
What are you talking about?

605
00:35:44.511 --> 00:35:47.648
Oh zip it. I know he paid for your
tits, just like he paid for mine!


606
00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.682
He likes tits on the women he
fucks!


607
00:35:49.716 --> 00:35:50.717
I... I... I...

608
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:53.220
I... I... I... now you sound
like my idiot son!


609
00:35:53.252 --> 00:35:54.488
Hey!

610
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.122
You want everything I have, you
always did, you jealous witch!


611
00:35:56.156 --> 00:35:59.993
Are you out of your fucking mind!? Why
would I ever want anything that's yours?!


612
00:36:00.026 --> 00:36:03.663
So you could be me! That's why you fucked
my husband and that's why you fucked my...


613
00:36:03.696 --> 00:36:04.397
SON!!

614
00:36:05.064 --> 00:36:08.934
Son is the word you're looking
for you diseased whore!


615
00:36:08.968 --> 00:36:15.241
I may have slept with your fucking sister,
but you slept with my son, you guttersnipe!


616
00:36:15.274 --> 00:36:19.078
Hey! Now you shut your mouth your mouth
about my sisters, you vile son of a bitch!


617
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:22.715
Look at the class of people you created
with that diseased cock of yours!


618
00:36:22.749 --> 00:36:24.116
An incestuous gigalo!

619
00:36:24.149 --> 00:36:25.285
A poisoning viper!

620
00:36:25.317 --> 00:36:27.354
A stuttering retard!! And a pig
with a...


621
00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:30.024
Oh my God!

622
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.360
He's murdering Carter! Someone
help!


623
00:36:35.328 --> 00:36:36.196
Call the police!

624
00:36:36.229 --> 00:36:37.431
Nobody's calling anyone!

625
00:36:38.997 --> 00:36:40.833
Oh God, oh Gaaaa!

626
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:42.301
Get the phones!!

627
00:36:42.334 --> 00:36:44.971
Oh God NO!

628
00:36:57.015 --> 00:36:57.850
No!

629
00:37:00.352 --> 00:37:02.822
Why would you do that, you
bitch!


630
00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:12.066
Oh my God, Carter!

631
00:37:13.767 --> 00:37:15.868
Ahhh! God damn it!

632
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:18.137
Hey! You don't have to be so
rough with him, alright! Just...


633
00:37:18.171 --> 00:37:19.239
Get off me, man!

634
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.279
Come on Penny, this is nuts!

635
00:37:26.312 --> 00:37:28.949
Back off, Prom Queen.

636
00:37:28.982 --> 00:37:31.017
God damn! This guy must work
out for a living!


637
00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:33.452
Get off me! Get the fuck off
me!


638
00:37:33.486 --> 00:37:35.288
You killed him, you maniac!

639
00:37:35.321 --> 00:37:37.057
Ahhhhhhhhh!!

640
00:37:38.457 --> 00:37:40.826
Fuck you man! You're going to
fucking prison!


641
00:37:40.859 --> 00:37:43.863
No one's going to prison,
because no one's taking my father anywhere!


642
00:37:43.897 --> 00:37:44.865
You dig?!

643
00:37:44.897 --> 00:37:47.834
Get them off me, Penny! I can't
fucking breathe!


644
00:37:47.866 --> 00:37:48.935
Get off of him!

645
00:37:48.968 --> 00:37:50.803
Penny, get that knife away from
Jacqueline's throat!


646
00:37:50.837 --> 00:37:52.139
Not till you let Dad off the
floor!


647
00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:55.141
Penny, listen to me,
we're trying to keep Dad safe right now.


648
00:37:55.174 --> 00:37:58.444
Oh yeah, fuck you! You
mutherfucker!


649
00:37:58.477 --> 00:38:00.980
Step-mutherfucker, Dad! Hold it
together!


650
00:38:01.013 --> 00:38:02.481
Why is it so fucking hot in
here!


651
00:38:02.515 --> 00:38:04.183
Penny, just let Jacqueline go.

652
00:38:04.216 --> 00:38:06.819
Why, you got some tainted meat
you want to feed her?


653
00:38:06.852 --> 00:38:09.488
I'm not fucking around here,
Penny, let her go!


654
00:38:09.522 --> 00:38:10.957
Not till you let Dad go!

655
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.192
Let her go, you fucking bitch!

656
00:38:13.225 --> 00:38:17.129
You think he loves you? No one loves you,
you loser, your parents named you Penny


657
00:38:17.162 --> 00:38:18.898
because its what they thought
you were worth!


658
00:38:18.932 --> 00:38:21.134
You don't know shit!

659
00:38:21.167 --> 00:38:25.404
What I DO know is that the only way a miserable shit-stain
like you can get a job is because Daddy gave it to you!


660
00:38:25.437 --> 00:38:26.839
You think that makes him proud?

661
00:38:26.872 --> 00:38:28.340
You think that shows he loves
you?


662
00:38:28.375 --> 00:38:32.279
He fucking hates you for that!
He's fucking ashamed you're his daughter.


663
00:38:32.312 --> 00:38:35.315
You know how I know? Cause he
told me. HIMSELF!


664
00:38:37.082 --> 00:38:39.819
Let him GO!!

665
00:38:39.852 --> 00:38:44.557
Fine! FUCK IT! I'll knock you
fat ass out myself!!


666
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:47.795
Aw, what are you doin' man! Come
on, a little help here!


667
00:38:48.562 --> 00:38:50.330
Now... now what are you doin'
man?!


668
00:38:50.363 --> 00:38:52.031
Raaaaahh!!!

669
00:38:54.067 --> 00:38:57.037
Aahmygosh!! put the fucking
knife down!


670
00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:00.506
Ow! You stupid bitch!

671
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:06.580
Oh my God!

672
00:39:14.419 --> 00:39:16.455
Ahhh! Get this crazy
mutherfucker off me.


673
00:39:19.325 --> 00:39:21.528
What did you do to my dad?!

674
00:39:24.497 --> 00:39:25.933
Hey!

675
00:39:43.649 --> 00:39:45.051
Oh my God!

676
00:39:50.156 --> 00:39:52.625
I... I didn't know what else I
could do.


677
00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:56.430
Is he dead?

678
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:59.299
He's alive.

679
00:39:59.332 --> 00:40:00.100
Oh thank God!

680
00:40:00.133 --> 00:40:01.268
He's okay too.

681
00:40:01.301 --> 00:40:03.336
Well he's still fucking dead!

682
00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:05.571
Oh my God, Uncle
Carter.


683
00:40:05.604 --> 00:40:08.173
What's wrong with them? It's
like they've lost their minds!


684
00:40:08.207 --> 00:40:10.143
That's what it was, they're out
of their damn minds!


685
00:40:10.176 --> 00:40:11.143
It's like they were possessed.

686
00:40:11.176 --> 00:40:13.012
Yeah, that's what it is.
They're possessed!


687
00:40:16.616 --> 00:40:18.018
Fuck! Stop it!

688
00:40:20.053 --> 00:40:20.953
Well...

689
00:40:20.986 --> 00:40:23.322
I know what we have to do first.

690
00:40:33.265 --> 00:40:34.733
Are you sure that's gonna hold?

691
00:40:34.767 --> 00:40:38.370
Shit, I held a bumper on a van with
duct tape for six months. Watch out.


692
00:40:38.404 --> 00:40:40.073
Oh God! I can't look at that.

693
00:40:40.105 --> 00:40:42.308
That's the whole reason we're
moving the poor man.


694
00:41:00.526 --> 00:41:02.629
And why do you have a lock on
the outside of the door?


695
00:41:02.662 --> 00:41:04.196
It was the kids room.

696
00:41:04.229 --> 00:41:05.330
Yeah?

697
00:41:05.365 --> 00:41:09.268
Well, sometimes children
shouldn't be heard... or seen.


698
00:41:09.301 --> 00:41:11.070
Haven't you been listening?

699
00:41:11.104 --> 00:41:15.207
There were a lot of things that went down in
this house that you wouldn't want kids to see.


700
00:41:15.241 --> 00:41:18.679
Witness. Kids to witness is more
like it.


701
00:41:20.013 --> 00:41:21.081
Oh shit!

702
00:41:25.384 --> 00:41:26.986
It's fucking dead. It's fucked.

703
00:41:27.252 --> 00:41:28.620
We gotta call the police.

704
00:41:28.654 --> 00:41:30.122
Any luck?

705
00:41:30.156 --> 00:41:33.125
No, I put a couple of em in the
cauliflower rice, but they're all dead.


706
00:41:33.158 --> 00:41:35.028
Sugar in the punch killed 'em.

707
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.997
Yeah, the sugar.

708
00:41:37.029 --> 00:41:38.265
You say something?

709
00:41:38.964 --> 00:41:40.767
Who doesn't have a fucking house
phone?


710
00:41:40.799 --> 00:41:42.267
Mom? What are you doing?

711
00:41:42.301 --> 00:41:46.305
Well, if the police come, I have to
tidy up. It can't look like a pig sty.


712
00:41:46.339 --> 00:41:50.442
It's not gonna clean itself. And lord
knows the help have been no help at all.


713
00:41:50.475 --> 00:41:52.111
Is she fucking kidding?

714
00:41:52.145 --> 00:41:55.115
Our contract didn't say nothing about getting
into wrestling matches with maniacs.


715
00:41:55.147 --> 00:41:56.682
Or bringing dead bodies into
spare bedrooms.


716
00:41:56.716 --> 00:41:58.218
Okay, I'll go next door to see
if...


717
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.252
They're not here. They're in
Gstaad, skiing.


718
00:42:00.285 --> 00:42:02.288
They left a ski town to go
skiing?


719
00:42:03.256 --> 00:42:04.924
Course they did.

720
00:42:04.957 --> 00:42:08.093
Well dear most everyone leaves for the
holidays. That's why I like to come up here.


721
00:42:08.127 --> 00:42:09.695
Alright, what about the
Pelligrinos?


722
00:42:09.729 --> 00:42:13.332
Oh that horrible woman-and her husband?
I don't want them knowing my business.


723
00:42:13.366 --> 00:42:15.201
Can't someone just go to the
police?


724
00:42:15.234 --> 00:42:17.737
Mom look, your neighbors are
going to find out what happened!


725
00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.107
I'm sorry, I agree with your
mom.


726
00:42:20.406 --> 00:42:21.073
Excuse me?

727
00:42:21.107 --> 00:42:23.642
Uh, oh. Trouble in paradise.

728
00:42:23.676 --> 00:42:26.546
There's already too many witness, We
don't want to let any outsider into this.


729
00:42:26.578 --> 00:42:28.314
Right now, we can control this
story.


730
00:42:28.346 --> 00:42:29.582
What are you talking about?

731
00:42:29.615 --> 00:42:31.216
I'm just saying, that depending
on how you deal with all this...


732
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:34.654
Your family could be in some very big
trouble with your Dad's Board of Directors.


733
00:42:34.687 --> 00:42:36.623
If you have any interest
controlling the family business.


734
00:42:36.656 --> 00:42:39.558
Ladies and Gentlemen... the
heart of a lawyer.


735
00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:41.059
You're not Dad's attorney.

736
00:42:41.093 --> 00:42:44.597
No, but he's going to need one and
one with a lot of perspective here.


737
00:42:45.598 --> 00:42:46.633
Is it hot in here?

738
00:42:48.167 --> 00:42:50.370
O-kay.

739
00:42:52.471 --> 00:42:53.439
We'll drive into town.

740
00:42:53.473 --> 00:42:54.641
Who was the last to get here?

741
00:42:54.674 --> 00:42:56.176
Dad... Leonard... Shit he's...

742
00:42:56.209 --> 00:42:57.109
Your father!...

743
00:42:57.142 --> 00:42:58.477
Blocking everyone in!

744
00:42:58.511 --> 00:43:00.213
Maybe someone could cut around
him?


745
00:43:00.245 --> 00:43:01.513
Well, I'm the next one in so...

746
00:43:01.546 --> 00:43:03.515
Oh no sir, you're not going
anywhere.


747
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:07.254
You'd just drive off and tell the police we killed
Carter and tied you father up, you little bitch.


748
00:43:09.388 --> 00:43:12.659
Okay Carol, nobody said that Penny
should go. I'm sorry sis, but


749
00:43:12.692 --> 00:43:15.095
Alright, who wants to try
cutting around Dad's car?


750
00:43:15.127 --> 00:43:19.432
I'll go, My van's in the...
uh... where my car keys?


751
00:43:19.464 --> 00:43:20.633
I don't have my keys, either.

752
00:43:20.665 --> 00:43:21.834
My keys aren't in my purse.

753
00:43:21.868 --> 00:43:23.336
Well, I always keep mine on
the...


754
00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:26.138
Alright, who took my keys!?

755
00:43:29.542 --> 00:43:30.410
Penny?

756
00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:32.412
What about your keys?

757
00:43:32.912 --> 00:43:37.651
Oh, um, in my pockets... pocket.

758
00:43:38.017 --> 00:43:39.618
They're probably in there.

759
00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:42.689
I don't think I'm gonna find
them in there, am I?


760
00:43:42.921 --> 00:43:45.157
Something tells me you know
where all of our keys are.


761
00:43:45.191 --> 00:43:49.261
Oh my God, I remember this.
She's done this shit before!


762
00:43:49.294 --> 00:43:50.129
When we were kids.

763
00:43:50.662 --> 00:43:52.564
It was... a holiday...?

764
00:43:52.598 --> 00:43:53.566
Your grandfather's funeral.

765
00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:56.602
That's it! She was like twelve
and she threw...


766
00:43:56.636 --> 00:43:58.738
All of our winter coats down the
incinerator!


767
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.573
My "HER MEEZ" took a twenty
floor drop.


768
00:44:00.605 --> 00:44:01.073
"Hermes."

769
00:44:01.607 --> 00:44:05.178
All because she didn't want
anyone to leave!


770
00:44:05.211 --> 00:44:08.781
All because Grandpa was the only
person in this family that loved me!


771
00:44:09.448 --> 00:44:12.184
And everyone was telling stories
about him, and


772
00:44:13.586 --> 00:44:14.788
I didn't want it to end.

773
00:44:19.192 --> 00:44:21.761
Wahh! Wahh! Wahh!

774
00:44:27.933 --> 00:44:29.903
I took your fucking keys.

775
00:44:29.935 --> 00:44:30.736
Why?

776
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.839
Fuck Why! Where? Where are
they?!


777
00:44:35.575 --> 00:44:36.810
In the Care Bear.

778
00:44:37.944 --> 00:44:41.281
In the back... bedroom.

779
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.154
With those lunatics?

780
00:44:48.187 --> 00:44:49.821
Oh, fuck them keys, I ain't
goin' in there!


781
00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:52.591
Well, does anybody know hot to
do...


782
00:44:52.625 --> 00:44:55.628
You know, that thing to get a car
going if you don't have the keys


783
00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.628
Hot-wire it?

784
00:44:56.662 --> 00:44:58.497
Yeah, does anybody know hot to
hot-wire a car?


785
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.238
Are you fucking kidding me?!
I don't know shit about hot-wiring a car!


786
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:06.439
You said you were a rapper.

787
00:45:06.471 --> 00:45:08.640
What's... What does that have to
do with hot-wiring a car?


788
00:45:08.674 --> 00:45:10.343
Well, you said you were from
Detroit.


789
00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:12.477
Man, that's some black on black
crime there!


790
00:45:12.511 --> 00:45:18.618
Detroit? No he's from Greenwich, Connecticut. And he was
a Fulbright scholar with a 3.8 grade point average.


791
00:45:18.651 --> 00:45:20.353
Would you stop? You're killing'
my street cred.


792
00:45:20.386 --> 00:45:21.922
How do you know so much about
the caterer?


793
00:45:23.488 --> 00:45:26.559
He's... my... roommate.

794
00:45:27.426 --> 00:45:30.495
I thought the Swedish girl was
your roommate.


795
00:45:30.529 --> 00:45:32.832
I am, but I'm not the one he's
fucking.


796
00:45:34.466 --> 00:45:39.738
Oh, come on, what's wrong with that?
Every growing boy needs some black dick.


797
00:45:41.973 --> 00:45:46.312
Oh! Is it hot in here?

798
00:45:47.314 --> 00:45:52.986
Kyle, please tell me that what this
disgusting person said is not true.


799
00:45:55.287 --> 00:45:55.921
Mom...

800
00:45:55.955 --> 00:45:57.856
Ma-ma-ma, don't ma-ma-ma me!

801
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:58.424
But Mom...

802
00:45:58.457 --> 00:46:00.593
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa what?

803
00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:02.961
Why should I be surprised by
anything my children do!


804
00:46:02.995 --> 00:46:05.964
All of my children are a disappointment
to me, you always have been!


805
00:46:05.997 --> 00:46:08.400
Why not one more thing for me to
be embarrassed about!


806
00:46:08.433 --> 00:46:10.069
Just listen to...

807
00:46:10.102 --> 00:46:15.307
No! I just want to know the truth! Are
you a... homosexual with this... person?!


808
00:46:20.446 --> 00:46:21.581
Yes!

809
00:46:23.381 --> 00:46:29.354
Yes I am fucking this beautiful
black man!


810
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:34.560
Because I am gay! And I love
black cock! I just love it!


811
00:46:34.593 --> 00:46:37.062
Can't get enough of it!...

812
00:46:37.096 --> 00:46:40.333
You racist,
homophobic whore!


813
00:46:40.366 --> 00:46:41.067
Kyle! DO NOT...

814
00:46:41.533 --> 00:46:47.039
No, no no... You finish one more
sentence for me and I


815
00:46:47.073 --> 00:46:51.310
Swear to God I will punch you so hard in
your uterus, you won't be able to foist


816
00:46:51.343 --> 00:46:53.779
Any more of its evil into this
God forsaken world!


817
00:46:53.812 --> 00:46:55.047
Oh, your mother can't...

818
00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:59.919
And you can just zip it Carol! I
know my Mom's past menopause and


819
00:46:59.951 --> 00:47:05.857
And she can't have kids! I was just making a point!
And God! Why is it so fucking hot in here!!


820
00:47:09.462 --> 00:47:10.396
Okay, it's okay.

821
00:47:10.428 --> 00:47:11.930
Jeee-zus

822
00:47:13.698 --> 00:47:18.370
I am not a homophobic. I'm the
most liberal person I know


823
00:47:19.104 --> 00:47:22.775
Am I the only one who thinks,
isn't it enough with the fags already?


824
00:47:24.142 --> 00:47:25.444
Um, hum.

825
00:47:25.977 --> 00:47:28.613
Is anybody else finding it
unbearably hot in here?


826
00:47:28.647 --> 00:47:32.685
This is all well and good and all, but we have
a dead man and two maniacs in the back bedroom


827
00:47:32.718 --> 00:47:34.754
With our car keys. What we gonna
do?


828
00:47:34.787 --> 00:47:37.890
I say we get the keys out of the back
bedroom and we get the hell out of here.


829
00:47:39.258 --> 00:47:43.696
Aghhhhh! Get off my
ass, you son of a bitch!


830
00:47:49.734 --> 00:47:51.738
Uhhhhh!

831
00:47:59.879 --> 00:48:00.647
Daddy?

832
00:48:09.154 --> 00:48:14.093
Is that my Rainy Day
girl I hear?


833
00:48:14.125 --> 00:48:19.865
Rainy Girl, why don't you let
your daddy out of this room?


834
00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:22.102
I'm really burning up here.

835
00:48:22.535 --> 00:48:27.941
I just want to get you some help, Daddy.
I just need the keys to your car.


836
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:30.910
You want to go for a
drive, sweetheart?


837
00:48:31.576 --> 00:48:32.944
Yeah, Dad.

838
00:48:32.979 --> 00:48:35.181
Wait you're not gonna
leave your daddy behind, now are you?


839
00:48:35.214 --> 00:48:37.417
No Daddy.

840
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:39.085
I just want to get you some
help.


841
00:48:39.118 --> 00:48:43.022
That's good, 'cause I
really hurt myself getting untied.


842
00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:48.961
I mean I'm bleeding... a lot.
It was your mother's idea wasn't it?


843
00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:52.999
I'm gonna tear her open from
cooter to her tooter, Rainy Girl.


844
00:48:53.031 --> 00:48:55.567
This is out of control. This
is... Go. We're going.


845
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.671
Where ya going, lover man?
You planning on taking my sister somewhere?


846
00:48:59.705 --> 00:49:01.172
There's something wrong with you
and Dad.


847
00:49:01.207 --> 00:49:04.210
There's nothing wrong with
me, little Sis, I'm just burning up


848
00:49:04.243 --> 00:49:07.013
It feels like my insides are
melting that's all...


849
00:49:07.245 --> 00:49:10.115
Hell, its nothing your
sweet ass can't make better.


850
00:49:10.149 --> 00:49:13.553
Shut
your filthy mouth, God damnit!


851
00:49:17.689 --> 00:49:23.061
Now listen Rainy, just open the door
and let us out so we can go outside.


852
00:49:23.095 --> 00:49:26.031
Yeah, we just really need
to get into the cold night air.


853
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:34.673
Mr. Pope, Ty Webb here.

854
00:49:35.207 --> 00:49:38.745
I'm gonna make sure that I can
get you the help that... you need


855
00:49:39.111 --> 00:49:41.480
That includes a vigorous defense
which I know I can...


856
00:49:41.513 --> 00:49:48.220
You still there, lover man? Now you hear
this and you hear this good, you get away from my sister or I


857
00:49:48.254 --> 00:49:52.225
I promise you that I'm gonna rip your
fucking head off and SKULL fuck it!


858
00:49:52.258 --> 00:49:54.526
Ok, there's something wrong with
you people.


859
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:55.862
Well?

860
00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:04.037
Daddy? Please let me help you.

861
00:50:07.138 --> 00:50:11.510
Just slide the key to your car
under the door, Ok?


862
00:50:11.843 --> 00:50:12.278
Okay.

863
00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:12.944
Ok

864
00:50:12.979 --> 00:50:14.279
Okay, Rainy Girl.

865
00:50:14.312 --> 00:50:14.980
Okay.

866
00:50:15.013 --> 00:50:16.749
I'll give it to you.

867
00:50:25.256 --> 00:50:26.392
Oh my God!

868
00:50:26.892 --> 00:50:31.263
I told you I hurt myself!
Now let me outta here you fucking bitch!


869
00:50:31.296 --> 00:50:33.031
Come on, it's over. Come on,
come on, come on...


870
00:50:33.064 --> 00:50:35.000
Come on. Go! Go!

871
00:50:35.033 --> 00:50:36.201
Pop!

872
00:50:36.234 --> 00:50:37.602
That'll work.

873
00:50:50.848 --> 00:50:56.721
Oh fuck! They're outside. And
look...


874
00:50:56.754 --> 00:50:59.892
Aww. What happend for Funshyne?

875
00:51:00.225 --> 00:51:02.160
So you think they used... Jesus!

876
00:51:02.627 --> 00:51:06.633
Break out the window. You see
any keys out there?


877
00:51:08.133 --> 00:51:09.201
Not a one.

878
00:51:20.645 --> 00:51:22.915
We need to go the the neighbors!
Right now!


879
00:51:23.216 --> 00:51:26.185
Told you I don't want that woman
knowing my business!


880
00:51:26.218 --> 00:51:28.053
You don't have a choice. Who's
coming with me?


881
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.055
I just want to get the hell
outta here.


882
00:51:30.089 --> 00:51:33.960
My Dad and Jackson just
broke out of the bedroom and are outside.


883
00:51:33.993 --> 00:51:35.094
Yeah, I'm gonna wait here
awhile.


884
00:51:35.127 --> 00:51:37.997
Look guys, I can probably handle
my Dad if I have to...


885
00:51:38.229 --> 00:51:41.700
Well sure, Daddy wouldn't want
to hurt his little Rainy Girl.


886
00:51:42.267 --> 00:51:44.970
I don't know if I can handle him
and Jackson.


887
00:51:48.973 --> 00:51:53.245
Fuck it! I'll go. The only thing
he's gonna hit me with is his cock.


888
00:51:53.946 --> 00:51:56.816
We'll I'm not going to let the
two of you go alone.


889
00:51:56.848 --> 00:51:57.917
Thanks. Yeah.

890
00:51:58.584 --> 00:52:01.821
I'll go straight there, make the call and
come back as soon as the cops arrive, okay?


891
00:52:01.854 --> 00:52:03.254
Okay. Hey sis...

892
00:52:03.287 --> 00:52:03.821
Yeah?

893
00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:05.757
Thanks for doing this.

894
00:52:07.926 --> 00:52:10.730
Yea. Keep an eye on Mom, ok.
She's starting to lose her shit.


895
00:52:10.763 --> 00:52:13.732
Love you. Be safe.

896
00:53:00.345 --> 00:53:01.312
Is that...

897
00:53:01.346 --> 00:53:03.249
They're not home.

898
00:53:05.116 --> 00:53:06.252
- So we'll break in then.
- Okay.


899
00:53:44.156 --> 00:53:45.825
Get behind that tree

900
00:53:58.937 --> 00:54:01.441
Go! Go!

901
00:54:28.399 --> 00:54:29.100
I don't see 'em.

902
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:33.072
Chef! Stay away from the window before
one of those crazy mutherfuckers see you


903
00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:34.072
They gonna know...

904
00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:36.008
Alright... I gotta get the fuck
outta here...


905
00:54:36.042 --> 00:54:41.413
I'm not waiting' for them to come back. I mean,
April's never finished a damn thing in her life and


906
00:54:41.446 --> 00:54:46.051
What, I'm gonna count on Johnny
Haircut and whore?


907
00:54:46.084 --> 00:54:48.053
Uhhhh, no!

908
00:54:48.086 --> 00:54:53.526
So who wants to make a thousand bucks to find one of
those car keys and drive me the Hell out of here?


909
00:54:53.792 --> 00:54:58.864
Ma'am, all due respect, you outta your
fuckin' mind if you think any of us...


910
00:54:58.897 --> 00:54:59.532
Ten thousand

911
00:54:59.564 --> 00:55:00.331
I'll do that!

912
00:55:00.365 --> 00:55:01.299
Time to go!

913
00:55:01.332 --> 00:55:02.000
What?!

914
00:55:02.033 --> 00:55:03.067
Babe, that's a lot of money!

915
00:55:03.102 --> 00:55:04.470
Plus there's only two of those
lunatics out there


916
00:55:04.502 --> 00:55:07.506
and the other one's already went
out, so they'll be luring em away.


917
00:55:07.538 --> 00:55:08.573
They'll be the one's getting
attacked!


918
00:55:08.607 --> 00:55:09.909
You mean my sister!?

919
00:55:09.942 --> 00:55:13.479
Yeah! Sorry. She'll be oaky.

920
00:55:13.511 --> 00:55:16.515
Babe, ten grand is enough to
produce my record.


921
00:55:16.547 --> 00:55:19.984
Yeah, but who gonna
rap on it when you dead, fool!?


922
00:55:20.017 --> 00:55:21.220
That's cold, baby...

923
00:55:21.252 --> 00:55:22.220
That's cold.

924
00:55:22.254 --> 00:55:24.089
Only one of you's gonna get that
money, honey.


925
00:55:24.122 --> 00:55:24.790
Gotta go!

926
00:55:27.158 --> 00:55:28.861
Babe, babe, babe... Just Wait...

927
00:55:33.899 --> 00:55:36.301
You're a vulgar pig.

928
00:55:37.002 --> 00:55:38.837
Oh, this is going to be good.

929
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:40.538
Excuuuuuuse me?

930
00:55:40.571 --> 00:55:44.175
Solve any problem by throwing
your Jew husband's money around.


931
00:55:44.209 --> 00:55:49.114
Hey! He's one of the good ones!
Not like one of those New York Jews


932
00:55:49.147 --> 00:55:52.218
What does it matter to you? Any
Jew'll do!


933
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:58.256
You're like a magic fountain. You just spread
your legs and the chosen money falls out!


934
00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:01.160
Hey kettle! The pot called.
You're black!


935
00:56:01.192 --> 00:56:03.528
I have never fucked a black!

936
00:56:03.562 --> 00:56:05.230
No, you just fucked your son!

937
00:56:05.263 --> 00:56:11.202
Step-son! And at least I never slept with
any of my sister's kids! Oh, why is that?


938
00:56:11.236 --> 00:56:15.607
Oh yeah, that's right! Because your womb is a
rocky place where no seed can find purchase.


939
00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.009
You fucking bitch!

940
00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:19.211
Jealous whore!

941
00:56:19.243 --> 00:56:23.448
Let's get ready to rummmmmble!

942
00:56:29.221 --> 00:56:31.257
Fuck, it's fucking hot out here!

943
00:56:31.457 --> 00:56:33.259
Are you kidding? 
It's freezing!

944
00:56:33.292 --> 00:56:37.630
Have you noticed everyone that freaks out gets
really overheated right before they lose it?


945
00:56:38.129 --> 00:56:42.267
And everyone who's been complaining
about the heat drank your mother's punch.


946
00:56:42.301 --> 00:56:45.171
Ty, honey... How much of that
punch did you have to drink?


947
00:56:45.638 --> 00:56:47.439
I don't know, a few cups. Why?

948
00:56:47.473 --> 00:56:52.244
It might be tainted. My Dad and Jackson were
drinking it like water right before they lost it.


949
00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:54.379
Stop! What?!... That's great!

950
00:56:54.412 --> 00:56:56.348
What? Why?

951
00:56:56.381 --> 00:56:59.651
It's a better defense! If your dad was poisoned,
that means his actions weren't his responsibility.


952
00:56:59.685 --> 00:57:03.154
No, Ty, if that's true you could be
infected with whatever they have.


953
00:57:05.357 --> 00:57:06.525
Oh fuck

954
00:57:07.625 --> 00:57:08.961
Let's hope so

955
00:57:10.428 --> 00:57:12.631
If we can connect all these dots

956
00:57:13.165 --> 00:57:15.234
the last eight months weren't
for nothing!


957
00:57:15.267 --> 00:57:16.569
What are you saying?

958
00:57:17.403 --> 00:57:22.408
I mean, I put in a lot of time here. Earlier this
evening it was looking like a pretty crappy investment.


959
00:57:22.707 --> 00:57:24.476
You're Dad's not your biggest
fan.


960
00:57:24.776 --> 00:57:28.213
This'd be a great way to get in
good with him though.


961
00:57:28.747 --> 00:57:32.218
Sounds like you're more interested in
April's father than you are in her.


962
00:57:33.118 --> 00:57:36.255
Well, no duh! Why do you think
I put a ring on it, you dum dum?


963
00:57:37.488 --> 00:57:38.389
Excuse me?

964
00:57:39.725 --> 00:57:44.697
Oh come on! You think I was just searching for some alcoholic
with more mommy & daddy issues than Lizzie Borden?


965
00:57:44.729 --> 00:57:50.336
No. Come on, you're rich.
Well, your family's rich.


966
00:57:50.368 --> 00:57:54.140
Now more than ever, your dad needs a brilliant
up and coming lawyer for a son-in-law.


967
00:57:55.307 --> 00:58:00.245
I'm his white knight, Bubbie.
Come on, let's get the cops out here


968
00:58:00.578 --> 00:58:05.084
and get your father on the road to exoneration.
Fuck! It's fucking hot out here.


969
00:58:14.725 --> 00:58:16.729
Come on sugar. Come on

970
00:58:25.236 --> 00:58:27.205
I haven't seen nothing out here.

971
00:58:27.672 --> 00:58:30.508
Shh. Quiet. Before one of those
crazy motherfuckers hear you.


972
00:58:30.542 --> 00:58:32.678
Ow! Bitch!

973
00:58:32.711 --> 00:58:36.448
Do I look like Kyle? That's right. Cause I'm not on
my knees sucking your dick. He's your bitch, not me!


974
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.749
Where the fucking keys?

975
00:58:37.783 --> 00:58:40.185
Oh I wish you were this tenacious
when the rent has to be paid!


976
00:58:40.218 --> 00:58:42.120
Wish you were this tenacious
when the rent has to be paid.


977
00:58:45.424 --> 00:58:46.258
Bitch

978
00:58:46.625 --> 00:58:49.495
She ‘bout to get some shit!

979
00:58:57.636 --> 00:59:01.640
Yes! Oh yeah, rent's about to
get paid bitch!


980
00:59:02.473 --> 00:59:03.408
Come here.

981
00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:06.377
Oh shit!

982
00:59:13.718 --> 00:59:19.625
Get. Off. My. Son.
You. Sonofa. Bitch.


983
00:59:23.095 --> 00:59:26.232
That's what you get when you
don't pay the rent on time


984
00:59:26.598 --> 00:59:27.533
Bitch.

985
00:59:30.167 --> 00:59:32.104
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Stop!

986
00:59:35.406 --> 00:59:38.142
Ahh oh no!

987
00:59:38.176 --> 00:59:39.143
Ah damn!

988
00:59:40.011 --> 00:59:44.116
You're so obsessed with me you
just can't wait to get my sloppy seconds!


989
00:59:44.316 --> 00:59:49.421
If you could've kept any of them satisfied
I wouldn't have to pinch hit for ya, sis!


990
00:59:49.453 --> 00:59:52.091
Aunt Carol, Mom! Stop this!

991
00:59:52.124 --> 00:59:52.792
Ahhhhh!

992
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:56.162
Um guys. Someone want to untie
me please?


993
00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:01.167
Ahh!

994
01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.642
Oh! Two crazy white bitches AND
a knife?


995
01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:14.279
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. Ya
on your own.


996
01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:16.347
No, no, no

997
01:00:16.381 --> 01:00:19.118
I'm gonna slice
your tits off!


998
01:00:19.151 --> 01:00:21.787
Seriously this is how I die? Let
me go!


999
01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.768
Ok, Ok

1000
01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:40.605
Oh, for God's sakes! Who the hell could be knocking.
Oh my God do you have any idea what time it is!?


1001
01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:42.473
Do you have ANY idea what time
it is!?


1002
01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:43.874
I'm so sorry this is an
emergency!


1003
01:00:43.908 --> 01:00:46.878
Emergency? What kind of an emergency?
Aren't you one of the Popes?


1004
01:00:46.912 --> 01:00:49.381
Yeah, hi I'm April. We need your
help.


1005
01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:51.917
You sure do. Your mother is a
terrible person. Merry Christmas.


1006
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.285
No, no, no. We just have to use
your phone to call the Police.


1007
01:00:54.319 --> 01:00:55.888
Police? What did she do now?

1008
01:00:55.921 --> 01:00:57.355
Denise! Who the
hell is it!?


1009
01:00:57.388 --> 01:00:58.356
It's the Pope kid.

1010
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:59.424
Which one!?

1011
01:00:59.457 --> 01:01:02.194
Oh. Hey. How ya doin?

1012
01:01:02.227 --> 01:01:04.196
They need to use the phone to
call the Police.


1013
01:01:04.229 --> 01:01:05.196
What's the problem?

1014
01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:06.330
She's a Pope and they're a bunch
of liars!


1015
01:01:06.365 --> 01:01:08.232
For God's sakes Denise, get the
kid a phone already!


1016
01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:08.999
You get her a phone!

1017
01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:10.035
My phone's all the way upstairs!

1018
01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:12.370
Oh you're an idiot. I'll get the
cordless.


1019
01:01:12.404 --> 01:01:14.172
So how's it going? Is everybody
ok?


1020
01:01:14.205 --> 01:01:16.408
No, No. My Dad and my Brother
are sick.


1021
01:01:16.441 --> 01:01:17.475
So what do you need the Police
for?


1022
01:01:17.508 --> 01:01:18.476
Because he killed someone.

1023
01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:19.477
What!? Who killed someone?

1024
01:01:19.511 --> 01:01:21.680
Would you shut the fuck up, you
stupid whore!


1025
01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:22.915
Hey! What the hell is this!?

1026
01:01:22.948 --> 01:01:24.783
Denise. Don't come back out
here.


1027
01:01:24.816 --> 01:01:26.283
What the hell's the matter with
you pal!?


1028
01:01:26.317 --> 01:01:28.252
With me? There's nothing wrong with me.
It's just fucking hot out.


1029
01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:29.887
It's a million fucking degrees
out here!


1030
01:01:29.921 --> 01:01:31.156
He's on drugs!

1031
01:01:31.189 --> 01:01:32.656
Alright, you people need to get
the hell out of here right now.


1032
01:01:32.691 --> 01:01:34.926
Please we just have to use your phone.
They could be out here right now.


1033
01:01:34.959 --> 01:01:36.060
Who could be out here?

1034
01:01:36.095 --> 01:01:38.297
What the hell are you doing!? I
told you to stay inside!


1035
01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:41.667
There's a very important man's business at stake right
now so I'm coming into your house to use your phone.


1036
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.870
You're not coming in here.
You're not coming in here!


1037
01:01:45.971 --> 01:01:47.406
I need to use your phone

1038
01:01:49.741 --> 01:01:51.576
You know I'm really sorry it's
just


1039
01:01:51.609 --> 01:01:53.778
Get your fucking hands off of
me!


1040
01:01:53.812 --> 01:01:55.747
Hey, hey, hey I'm sorry. I'm
sorry.


1041
01:01:55.779 --> 01:01:57.548
Don't touch my sister.

1042
01:02:01.486 --> 01:02:02.922
Al-bert!

1043
01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:13.966
Hey man. Made you a promise,
didn't I?


1044
01:02:18.303 --> 01:02:19.371
Noooooo!

1045
01:02:39.658 --> 01:02:40.926
Salty.

1046
01:02:40.959 --> 01:02:42.461
Come on, come on.

1047
01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:43.796
Son Fucker!

1048
01:02:47.899 --> 01:02:51.537
Uhhh! You bitch!

1049
01:02:51.803 --> 01:02:54.740
Ahhh!

1050
01:03:06.618 --> 01:03:08.420
Ma, ma, ma, my mom!

1051
01:03:13.792 --> 01:03:15.494
Die you bitch!

1052
01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:19.832
Ohhhh!

1053
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:27.006
Ughhhhhh

1054
01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:32.810
That fucking hurts Goddammit.

1055
01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:39.384
Cuuunt

1056
01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:51.562
Is it hot in
here or is it me?

1057
01:03:58.903 --> 01:04:00.506
Mom, mom?

1058
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:05.544
Ahhh, hey.

1059
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.881
I know you've been through a lot
tonight but if you wouldn't mind.


1060
01:04:10.915 --> 01:04:16.087
I'd rather not spend the rest of the
Winter tied to THIS FUCKING CHAIR!


1061
01:04:18.656 --> 01:04:23.729
Willy, willy! God damn you dumb mother
fucker I'm trying to help your simple


1062
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:26.498
Is that my van?

1063
01:04:36.674 --> 01:04:43.716
I told you nobody drives my van
but me. You son of a bitch.


1064
01:04:48.586 --> 01:04:49.687
What are you doing?

1065
01:04:49.721 --> 01:04:52.891
Listening to the last song Willy
recorded before he died.


1066
01:04:52.924 --> 01:04:54.593
Died? When did Willy

1067
01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:12.477
The help never says when dinner
is served.


1068
01:05:13.245 --> 01:05:17.015
That was my friend. You are not
my friend.


1069
01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:41.572
Come on! Ok
come on! Oh my God!


1070
01:06:00.758 --> 01:06:01.759
Are you ok?

1071
01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:05.631
I don't know. I think something
snapped or tore.


1072
01:06:06.698 --> 01:06:09.701
Ahh. This fucking Shari
necklace.


1073
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.071
Oh baby. Don't run away.

1074
01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:16.240
I just wanna fuck you to death!

1075
01:06:16.274 --> 01:06:17.008
Can you walk?

1076
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:23.215
Oh. I am not gonna be that girl who tripped and
got killed by her boyfriend turned psycho.


1077
01:06:57.915 --> 01:07:00.151
Swear I saw car keys. Where are
the keys!?


1078
01:07:24.575 --> 01:07:33.618
Daddy. Dad.

1079
01:07:55.073 --> 01:07:57.776
I'm so hot inside! I can't
breathe.


1080
01:07:57.808 --> 01:08:01.046
It's just like my stomach is
boiling into my chest and


1081
01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:08.019
Oh that's better!

1082
01:08:28.406 --> 01:08:32.076
Please. Let me go.

1083
01:08:35.113 --> 01:08:39.084
Hey sis. I brought you a
present!


1084
01:08:42.653 --> 01:08:46.624
But I'm sorry. He's not gonna be
a virgin on your wedding night.


1085
01:08:46.657 --> 01:08:48.626
Please let go. Stop. Let go!

1086
01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.796
See I made a promise to your man
here.


1087
01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:55.800
And a promise-is a promise.

1088
01:09:04.742 --> 01:09:06.778
That's what you get!

1089
01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:16.087
What did I tell you?

1090
01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:22.359
No! Oh my God! Help us!

1091
01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:26.764
Think this is weird? It's not
gay if he's dead.


1092
01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:30.701
Shut your mouth. Haha!

1093
01:09:30.968 --> 01:09:33.371
Please open up! Help us! Please!

1094
01:09:33.403 --> 01:09:36.407
Open! Oh my God! Please!

1095
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:55.993
You hurt me real bad Penny.

1096
01:09:56.027 --> 01:09:58.130
Guess I'm gonna have to
skull-fuck you too.


1097
01:10:06.103 --> 01:10:07.405
Well you're welcome.

1098
01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.410
What did you do?

1099
01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:13.077
Just saved your ass.

1100
01:10:13.111 --> 01:10:15.380
What did you do?

1101
01:10:15.412 --> 01:10:16.113
Que

1102
01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:18.148
You killed the phones.

1103
01:10:18.182 --> 01:10:19.282
You hid the keys.

1104
01:10:19.317 --> 01:10:23.488
You did everything in your power
to hold us hostage. Why?


1105
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.992
Is Rainy Day pissed someone took the
spotlight on her Secret Santa year?


1106
01:10:29.861 --> 01:10:32.296
What did you put in Mom's punch?

1107
01:10:34.432 --> 01:10:37.868
Kyle, go get me that bag she
won't let anyone near.


1108
01:10:38.469 --> 01:10:39.871
Fuck off.

1109
01:10:45.009 --> 01:10:47.078
This. This. What were these?

1110
01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:49.446
Go fuck yourself.

1111
01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:52.282
Oh Fuck. What are you, a dude?

1112
01:10:52.316 --> 01:10:56.353
I was until I had the popsicle
and bonbons removed two years ago.


1113
01:10:59.256 --> 01:11:01.893
What was in these bottles,
Penny!?


1114
01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:06.398
Kyle, go get me her punch.

1115
01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:13.370
If you didn't do anything, why
is your cup full?


1116
01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:20.478
If you didn't do anything, you won't have a problem
drinking it, would you? Drink it. Drink it.


1117
01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:22.947
This all happened because of
you.


1118
01:11:23.514 --> 01:11:26.817
Whatever you put in here
sentenced them all to death.


1119
01:11:27.251 --> 01:11:28.820
Mom is dead.

1120
01:11:28.853 --> 01:11:31.855
Ty is dead.

1121
01:11:31.889 --> 01:11:34.226
They're all fucking dead.

1122
01:11:38.996 --> 01:11:42.033
Again. You're welcome.

1123
01:11:45.603 --> 01:11:47.072
Dad is dead.

1124
01:11:51.943 --> 01:11:53.779
He wasn't supposed to be here.

1125
01:11:53.978 --> 01:11:56.413
He was supposed to stay in L.A.

1126
01:11:56.447 --> 01:11:59.017
I didn't intend for it to go
down like this.


1127
01:12:00.852 --> 01:12:04.156
I just thought everybody would
be honest for once.


1128
01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:07.192
And they'd be forced to look at
themselves.


1129
01:12:07.224 --> 01:12:10.928
What is it?

1130
01:12:11.895 --> 01:12:13.430
WHAT THE FUCK IS IT!?

1131
01:12:13.464 --> 01:12:15.567
New version of sodium pentothol.

1132
01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:16.834
It's a truth serum.

1133
01:12:16.867 --> 01:12:19.102
It's one of dad's defense
contracts.


1134
01:12:19.135 --> 01:12:23.374
Supposed to be crazy powerful
but it's just a truth serum.


1135
01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:26.477
The capsuls-I opened them up
and put them in the punch


1136
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:29.948
And voila Everyone tells the
truth. Alright!?


1137
01:12:30.314 --> 01:12:32.116
Everyone tell's the truth.

1138
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:38.456
But I think it also makes people
lose impulse control and


1139
01:12:38.488 --> 01:12:43.160
They just start doing what they think
they should do, no matter how fucked up.


1140
01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:47.198
Yeah and then they boil from the
inside out and go to pieces.


1141
01:12:47.965 --> 01:12:49.234
Literally.

1142
01:12:49.267 --> 01:12:49.968
They do?

1143
01:12:50.001 --> 01:12:50.502
Yes.

1144
01:12:52.036 --> 01:12:54.038
Pretty sure that's what happened
to dad.


1145
01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:57.209
Why would you do
it?


1146
01:13:00.144 --> 01:13:03.181
I mean what the fuck is wrong
with you Penny?


1147
01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:10.020
I get that you have no fucking
self control, but why?


1148
01:13:10.688 --> 01:13:12.957
Why hurt your whole family?

1149
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:14.626
My family!? What family!?

1150
01:13:14.658 --> 01:13:17.461
I didn't choose you. You sure as
shit didn't choose me.


1151
01:13:17.495 --> 01:13:22.233
If I weren't related to you, none of you
would piss on me if I were on fucking fire.


1152
01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:27.504
But because we all exploded out of the same volcanic
hole, we're supposed to have this bond for life?


1153
01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:29.406
It's bullshit!

1154
01:13:29.439 --> 01:13:36.413
When this family loses control of it's
ID, we choose to fucking kill each other.


1155
01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.584
It's because we fucking hate
each other.


1156
01:13:39.617 --> 01:13:41.486
That's not true.

1157
01:13:43.254 --> 01:13:44.421
I love you.

1158
01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:47.457
And I love April.

1159
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:50.694
And I loved Mom and I love Dad

1160
01:13:50.728 --> 01:13:52.130
Didn't you drink that shit?

1161
01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:54.465
Yes, you stupid bitch.

1162
01:13:55.666 --> 01:13:57.602
So you're telling the truth?

1163
01:13:59.737 --> 01:14:01.605
Must be!

1164
01:14:04.075 --> 01:14:06.010
You still love all of us?

1165
01:14:09.346 --> 01:14:15.687
I mean, Jacksons kind of an
asshole... but I still love him.


1166
01:14:17.087 --> 01:14:18.422
Love you too bro.

1167
01:14:20.124 --> 01:14:20.959
It's funny.

1168
01:14:21.326 --> 01:14:23.228
Only makes me want to kill you
more.


1169
01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:30.567
Nice girl!

1170
01:14:41.312 --> 01:14:43.448
Hahahaha!

1171
01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:46.617
Ahhhh!

1172
01:15:03.134 --> 01:15:06.705
You get as good as you give.
That makes me hard!


1173
01:15:08.139 --> 01:15:10.708
She used to have a dick you
idiot!


1174
01:15:10.741 --> 01:15:13.511
That just makes me harder!

1175
01:15:13.544 --> 01:15:15.380
Oh come on!

1176
01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:31.495
Get the fuck off of ME!

1177
01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:33.365
,

1178
01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:43.508
Wow you guys really acted like a
family.


1179
01:15:45.809 --> 01:15:47.812
Maybe there's hope for the world
yet.


1180
01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:48.578
Jacqueline!

1181
01:15:52.450 --> 01:15:56.621
Don't you touch my sweet baby
boy you freak!


1182
01:16:03.527 --> 01:16:04.496
Die!

1183
01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:08.700
Why

1184
01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:13.604
Cant you at least do something
with your hair?


1185
01:16:18.175 --> 01:16:20.378
You're like some mythical beast!

1186
01:16:20.644 --> 01:16:25.417
You started all of this. It all
comes from you!


1187
01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:33.558
Well tonight I'm gonna slay the
God damn Hydra!


1188
01:16:34.457 --> 01:16:35.626
Stop!

1189
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:40.197
Stop!

1190
01:16:56.846 --> 01:17:05.755
Mommy?

1191
01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:08.693
Maaaa!

1192
01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:15.633
Oh. Ah. Ahhhhhhhhh!

1193
01:17:15.666 --> 01:17:17.235
You didn't have to kill her!

1194
01:17:17.268 --> 01:17:18.236
She was alive!!

1195
01:17:33.751 --> 01:17:34.686
Penny?

1196
01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.874
Ahhhh!

1197
01:20:48.478 --> 01:20:50.747
Penny stop. Stop this please.

1198
01:20:50.781 --> 01:20:52.817
Stop it doesn't have to be like
this.


1199
01:20:53.584 --> 01:20:56.019
You can't save me!

1200
01:20:58.389 --> 01:21:00.091
Stop it. Please let me

1201
01:21:04.495 --> 01:21:06.331
Save yourself bitch.

1202
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:15.105
Penny look at me. I love you.

1203
01:21:18.776 --> 01:21:22.746
Penny I do. I do.

1204
01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:26.817
Tear your lying tongue out.

1205
01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:28.452
Ahhhh!

1206
01:21:57.781 --> 01:21:58.850
Noooo!

1207
01:22:10.827 --> 01:22:15.499
Merry. Fucking. Christmas.

1208
01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:47.063
Yeah get some.

1209
01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:48.197
Get some what?

1210
01:22:48.232 --> 01:22:50.868
My, that's terrible. Did you
just hit that woman?


1211
01:22:50.901 --> 01:22:52.536
Well yeah that's how you score
points.


1212
01:22:52.568 --> 01:22:54.705
Sarah, why do you let him play
this?


1213
01:22:54.737 --> 01:22:58.174
Mom, the phone is his Christmas
present. Let him enjoy it.


1214
01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:01.545
I don't know. The way mothers
raise kids these days.


1215
01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:04.714
I never let you have violent
things like this.


1216
01:23:04.747 --> 01:23:07.117
The movies, the video games.
It's all


1217
01:23:07.384 --> 01:23:10.187
No wonder the world's going to
H. E. double hockey sticks.


1218
01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:12.155
Didn't you see Clockwork Orange
when you were like eleven?


1219
01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:13.189
Oh that's just not true.

1220
01:23:13.223 --> 01:23:14.358
That was a good one.

1221
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:15.893
We saw that when we first got
cable, didn't we David?


1222
01:23:15.925 --> 01:23:17.194
That was awesome dad.

1223
01:23:19.095 --> 01:23:21.598
Why do we have to come here
every year? It's so boring.


1224
01:23:21.631 --> 01:23:23.533
Because your grandmother loves
you


1225
01:23:23.567 --> 01:23:24.667
And I don't?

1226
01:23:24.701 --> 01:23:26.569
That's not what I was saying
Bev.


1227
01:23:26.603 --> 01:23:29.073
Dillon, Grandma Margret loves seeing you.
It makes her holiday.


1228
01:23:29.105 --> 01:23:30.941
Yeah but she smells like cat
pee.


1229
01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:34.777
That's not funny. That's my
mother.


1230
01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:35.679
I know

1231
01:23:36.179 --> 01:23:37.814
She does smell like it.

1232
01:23:37.848 --> 01:23:39.617
She really does Sarah.

1233
01:23:39.649 --> 01:23:41.885
Hey what do you say about us
when we're not here?


1234
01:23:41.919 --> 01:23:42.819
Dad. Look out!

1235
01:23:47.558 --> 01:23:50.127
What the hell is she doing in the
middle of the God damn street!?


1236
01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.194
David it's Christmas!

1237
01:23:51.228 --> 01:23:52.663
Look. Come on!

1238
01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.567
Something's wrong with her.

1239
01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:11.982
Hey? You ok?

1240
01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:15.853
Miss? You alright?

1241
01:24:16.486 --> 01:24:18.622
She told the truth.

1242
01:24:19.322 --> 01:24:22.158
Wait. It was a lie,
right?


1243
01:24:22.858 --> 01:24:24.995
No. It wasn't a
lie, right?


1244
01:24:26.197 --> 01:24:30.601
She said it.
But she did it because it was the truth.


1245
01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.170
Is she ok. Should I call the
Police?


1246
01:24:34.004 --> 01:24:36.974
Miss. I think you need some
help.


1247
01:24:37.273 --> 01:24:41.278
I got them to come and now
they're dead.


1248
01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:53.957
All of them. They just told the
truth and they kill each other.


1249
01:24:53.991 --> 01:24:54.858
Who's dead!?

1250
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:58.328
My. Whole. Family.

1251
01:25:01.631 --> 01:25:03.067
You tried to run me over.

1252
01:25:03.099 --> 01:25:05.268
No. You were in the middle of
the street, I just


1253
01:25:12.075 --> 01:25:14.178
You tried to kill me there

1254
01:25:14.411 --> 01:25:16.880
You Robert Redfordy piece of
shit.


1255
01:25:16.912 --> 01:25:18.014
Excuse me?

1256
01:25:18.047 --> 01:25:19.116
David don't get too close

1257
01:26:24.067 --> 01:26:29.067
