00:01:22.496 --> 00:01:25.333
* In your face now

2
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:28.336
* Life's no drag now

3
00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.372
* Movin' faster

4
00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:34.675
* Through tomorrow

5
00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:37.111
* I'm riding high again

6
00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:40.114
* This dream of
mine just never ends *

7
00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:42.783
* I'm coming back let's not pretend *

8
00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:46.154
* Come on, come on

9
00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:48.689
* Can't hold me back,
won't hold me back *


10
00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:50.358
* No, no, no, no

11
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:51.559
* I'm back on track

12
00:01:51.592 --> 00:01:54.662
* Can't hold me back,
don't hold me back *


13
00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:56.430
* No, no, no, no

14
00:01:56.464 --> 00:01:57.465
* Can't

15
00:01:57.498 --> 00:02:00.301
* Hold me back

16
00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:15.649
Uh-huh, yeah.

17
00:02:17.618 --> 00:02:21.689
Okay, lover boy.

18
00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:23.524
I'll see you in second period.

19
00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:27.561
Hey, bitch.

20
00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:32.433
And don't you forget it, bitch.

21
00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:36.370
Us bitches gotta stick together right?

22
00:02:36.404 --> 00:02:38.839
Yes, we do.

23
00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:41.442
So what is the collective
noun for a group of bitches?


24
00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:43.411
- A flock?
- A gaggle.


25
00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:45.846
- A platoon.
- A swarm.


26
00:02:47.415 --> 00:02:49.350
Oh, I know, a herd.

27
00:02:49.383 --> 00:02:51.485
Oh, yeah, thanks, makes us
sound like a bunch of cows.


28
00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.520
Moo, baby.

29
00:02:54.622 --> 00:02:56.224
You little shit.

30
00:02:57.458 --> 00:03:01.429
Aww, so sorry, did I
invade your personal space?


31
00:03:01.462 --> 00:03:02.896
Here, let me help.

32
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.233
I don't want your fucking help.

33
00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.436
Very immature, guys.

34
00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:14.542
"She touched me,
like no guy has ever."


35
00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:16.244
Jealous much?

36
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:20.548
Jesus, there's a case
for selective breeding.


37
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:22.750
Little shit's too big for his boots.

38
00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:25.253
Needs respect.

39
00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.322
What the fuck are you
looking at Chantelle?


40
00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:30.958
Shit he scratched my phone.

41
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:32.426
Did you get another new phone?

42
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.430
Yeah, it's a bit
chunky but shiny, touch.


43
00:03:36.464 --> 00:03:37.698
It's only like three months old.

44
00:03:37.731 --> 00:03:39.900
I got her old iPhone. Yay.

45
00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:41.469
Wow, it's impressive.

46
00:03:41.502 --> 00:03:43.003
And it's shiny and has pretty pictures.

47
00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:44.305
Oh, and YouTube.

48
00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:45.906
Most phones have YouTube.

49
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.875
Hello, shiny, pretty pictures.

50
00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:49.443
Oh, my God.

51
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.515
So are we still on for tonight?

52
00:03:54.548 --> 00:03:57.485
Yeah, totally, 
Kyle is coming.

53
00:03:57.518 --> 00:03:58.586
Already?

54
00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:00.521
Yeah, I've heard that about him.

55
00:04:00.554 --> 00:04:01.789
Won't see much of you two then.

56
00:04:01.822 --> 00:04:03.524
I hope not, nothing personal.

57
00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:04.758
Has anyone spoken to Tess?

58
00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:06.794
Yeah, she's totally in,
and Stu of course.


59
00:04:06.827 --> 00:04:10.298
- What about Marty?
- Yeah, what about Marty?


60
00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:13.467
We were just talking about you.

61
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:17.338
And a hot and steamy dream
Brie had about you.


62
00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:18.372
Do tell.

63
00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:21.475
Well, you were both
lying naked inserting your


64
00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.612
memory sticks into
each others USB ports.


65
00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:25.279
Ew geek porn.

66
00:04:25.313 --> 00:04:27.281
I'm impressed.

67
00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:28.349
I didn't--

68
00:04:28.382 --> 00:04:30.884
That Jules knows what a USB is.

69
00:04:30.918 --> 00:04:34.522
You're right, my God,
the nerd gene is contagious.


70
00:04:34.555 --> 00:04:36.457
And the geek shall inherit the earth.

71
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.025
Thought that was cockroaches.

72
00:04:38.058 --> 00:04:42.029
Besides, haven't you heard,
geek is the new chic.


73
00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:45.366
- Is that the new N97?
- I hear it has Maemo 6.1.


74
00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:47.768
Bluetooth three plus.
Yeah, and pretty pictures.


75
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:49.603
Why do I hang with you dorks again?

76
00:04:49.637 --> 00:04:50.904
Intelligence by association.

77
00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:52.573
Comic value maybe?

78
00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:53.707
You're secretly a geek.

79
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:55.576
You own more gadgets than anyone I know.

80
00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:58.779
That's not a geek,
that's Daddy's little Princess.


81
00:04:58.812 --> 00:05:00.514
Hello, I'm right here.

82
00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:02.383
Perhaps try insulting
me when I'm not around.


83
00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:03.584
If you insist.

84
00:05:03.617 --> 00:05:04.552
Ah, thanks.

85
00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:06.887
Enjoy the intellectual
stimulation of media.


86
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.622
Later bitches.

87
00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:10.658
Why do we hang out with her again?

88
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:11.792
I don't know.

89
00:05:11.825 --> 00:05:13.060
Jules is okay.

90
00:05:13.093 --> 00:05:14.828
Come on, guys, you know the rules,

91
00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:17.030
pop your phone in the box.

92
00:05:17.798 --> 00:05:19.567
Thank you.

93
00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:21.702
Bonjour, mon cheri.

94
00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:23.704
Thank you.

95
00:05:23.737 --> 00:05:24.872
Good morning, class.

96
00:05:24.905 --> 00:05:27.775
Good morning, Ms. Halms.

97
00:05:27.808 --> 00:05:30.578
Now some of you may have
noticed that we no longer


98
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:31.979
have cell phone coverage
in this classroom.


99
00:05:32.012 --> 00:05:33.647
Oh, what?

100
00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:35.983
And we will be
implementing and enforcing


101
00:05:36.016 --> 00:05:40.554
a ban on phones in class
as in exam conditions.


102
00:05:40.588 --> 00:05:42.055
You have been warned.

103
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:46.494
Now, luckily,
the jammer I have will send


104
00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:49.129
all of your calls and messages
through to your voice mail,


105
00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:51.599
so I'm not denying service
I'm simply diverting.


106
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.541
Although, I wasn't expecting
such a quick response.


107
00:06:00.574 --> 00:06:05.078
- Hand it over, Mr. Pollock.
- Me? I, I've been warned.


108
00:06:05.112 --> 00:06:07.581
As you seem to have such
a keen interest in this,


109
00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:09.483
you won't mind joining
me over term break


110
00:06:09.517 --> 00:06:10.884
to help tighten up the protocol.

111
00:06:10.918 --> 00:06:14.087
- Yes.
- Thank you.


112
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:15.823
See me after class.

113
00:06:17.825 --> 00:06:20.694
And your Dad's cool?

114
00:06:20.728 --> 00:06:23.631
I was just honest with him.

115
00:06:23.664 --> 00:06:25.799
We have an understanding,
he keeps me on a long leash,


116
00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:27.501
and I won't bite.

117
00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:29.603
Oh, smart man.

118
00:06:29.637 --> 00:06:32.773
He was overprotective for
awhile you know, after mum.


119
00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:35.543
Here it is.
YouTube's finest.


120
00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:37.878
Oh, much amusement at
the expense of others.


121
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:39.012
A personal favorite of mine.

122
00:06:39.046 --> 00:06:40.614
Well you have to dig for gold among

123
00:06:40.648 --> 00:06:41.482
the Star Wars fan movies

124
00:06:41.515 --> 00:06:44.618
and foolish teens flashing their bits.

125
00:06:44.652 --> 00:06:48.622
You know Marty's thinking of
web-casting our party on Screen-It.


126
00:06:48.656 --> 00:06:51.892
I thought that got shut down.
After that bully-bash thing?


127
00:06:51.925 --> 00:06:54.061
Apparently not.

128
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:56.864
So where is this place again?

129
00:06:56.897 --> 00:06:59.099
I don't know,
some swanky beach-house


130
00:06:59.132 --> 00:07:00.367
Jules found out about.

131
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.637
Marty was going to send everyone
the location but I'll text him.


132
00:07:05.606 --> 00:07:08.108
So when are the semi-naked
guys going to writhe


133
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:10.744
wet and exposed for us girls hey?

134
00:07:10.778 --> 00:07:14.715
- Hit the showers girls.
- Here they come, go Kyle.


135
00:07:14.748 --> 00:07:16.049
Come on, my baby.

136
00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:17.985
Go Kyle show us what you got.

137
00:07:18.018 --> 00:07:20.053
We all know what you've got Kimmy.

138
00:07:20.087 --> 00:07:21.555
We've seen the videos.

139
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:22.556
Bitch.

140
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.158
Remember what we practiced,
focus on the catch.


141
00:07:25.192 --> 00:07:29.129
Watch the streamlining,

142
00:07:29.162 --> 00:07:30.764
Come on.

143
00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:33.901
On your marks, get set.

144
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.706
Beautiful.

145
00:07:41.675 --> 00:07:44.912
Come on, Kyle.
Go, son!


146
00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:46.547
Go, Kyle.

147
00:07:49.182 --> 00:07:50.751
That's it, come on.

148
00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:52.786
Do you think Kyle's dad's kind of hot?

149
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.887
Come on, push.

150
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:57.024
Yeah, in like a prison
guard sort of way.


151
00:07:57.057 --> 00:07:58.592
Come on!

152
00:07:58.626 --> 00:07:59.727
I'd do him.

153
00:08:00.894 --> 00:08:02.996
Come on, son, go!

154
00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:07.768
Yes!

155
00:08:07.801 --> 00:08:09.837
Ah, for christ sake.

156
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.839
Macka!

157
00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:13.541
Oi, what do you think you're
doing, you can't work here.


158
00:08:13.574 --> 00:08:15.743
- Macka, get out here!
- I'll deal with you later.


159
00:08:15.776 --> 00:08:18.679
- Macka!
- My poor baby was robbed.


160
00:08:18.712 --> 00:08:20.748
- Hold your horses.
- Well, what the hell are you doing?


161
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:22.783
- What?
- Well, look at the clock!


162
00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:24.652
- Yeah, and?
- It's still going isn't it?


163
00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:26.720
- Yeah.
- Well, it shouldn't be.


164
00:08:26.754 --> 00:08:28.722
Once they fix the timer and
re-calibrate, we'll re-run it tomorrow.


165
00:08:28.756 --> 00:08:31.759
Now on your bike, fix it.
Stay in the pool.


166
00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:34.094
Haven't you got class Miss Freeman?

167
00:08:34.127 --> 00:08:37.798
Some people would say
I have a lot of class.


168
00:08:39.867 --> 00:08:42.836
Hey, didn't Mike used to
coach Macka or something?


169
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.238
Um, yep they had a falling out.

170
00:08:45.272 --> 00:08:46.439
- Drugs.
- Ohh.


171
00:08:46.473 --> 00:08:50.611
Punches were thrown, blood
was let, usual macho bullshit.


172
00:08:50.644 --> 00:08:53.614
Before or after his,
the drink-driving thing?


173
00:08:53.647 --> 00:08:56.149
- Just before.
- Wow, sounds complicated, girl.


174
00:08:56.183 --> 00:08:57.951
Let's go.

175
00:08:59.052 --> 00:09:01.822
* I've been batting back a secret *

176
00:09:01.855 --> 00:09:04.124
* For whenever you're around

177
00:09:04.157 --> 00:09:07.194
* I feel my
heart begin to race *

178
00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:10.731
* And both my feet
lift off the ground *

179
00:09:10.764 --> 00:09:14.234
* It's like I'm
floating in slow motion *


180
00:09:14.267 --> 00:09:17.170
* High above our sleepy town

181
00:09:17.204 --> 00:09:20.140
* And I've been
trying not to notice *

182
00:09:20.173 --> 00:09:24.812
* It's a long way down

183
00:09:24.845 --> 00:09:26.847
Hey, Dane.

184
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.949
- What's up?
- What's up?


185
00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:32.886
You very well know
what's up, Miss Wisemann.


186
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.923
No helmet, reckless driving,

187
00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:38.759
that little stunt you pulled
back there through the park.


188
00:09:38.792 --> 00:09:41.328
Come on, don't be a stiff.

189
00:09:41.361 --> 00:09:43.931
A girl's gotta have some fun.

190
00:09:43.964 --> 00:09:45.866
Besides, hey, I can handle myself.

191
00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:50.070
I'm sure you can, look,
just put a helmet on, you know,


192
00:09:50.103 --> 00:09:51.905
and set a good example and all.

193
00:09:51.939 --> 00:09:53.073
Oh, like you?

194
00:09:54.374 --> 00:09:56.744
Go on, get outta here.

195
00:10:04.017 --> 00:10:05.719
Aw, come on.

196
00:10:36.316 --> 00:10:39.386
Hello? Hello.

197
00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:10.984
- Good one, Kyle.
- What?


198
00:11:11.018 --> 00:11:12.886
Aww, Brisie-poo.

199
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.688
Shut up.

200
00:11:14.722 --> 00:11:18.091
You should have seen your face.

201
00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.894
Wow, couldn't have found
anywhere a little more--


202
00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:22.763
- Vulgar?
- Discrete?


203
00:11:22.796 --> 00:11:24.364
Who owns this place?

204
00:11:24.397 --> 00:11:26.967
Apparently they're O.S.
Jules got a tip-off.


205
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.870
That's not the only
tip Jules is getting off.


206
00:11:29.903 --> 00:11:31.171
Oh, God.

207
00:11:31.204 --> 00:11:32.873
Brie, just chuck your
stuff in the kitchen.


208
00:11:35.175 --> 00:11:37.210
I reckon it will just
be the guys, hang on.


209
00:11:37.244 --> 00:11:38.445
I'll get it.

210
00:11:41.982 --> 00:11:43.183
Hey.

211
00:11:48.922 --> 00:11:50.991
Jesus, you guys scared
the shit out of me.


212
00:11:51.024 --> 00:11:53.060
Anyone would think you're
breaking the law or something.


213
00:11:53.093 --> 00:11:54.327
Don't tell your dad.

214
00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:55.929
- Hi.
- Hiya.


215
00:11:55.963 --> 00:11:58.732
- Hey, how are you going?
- Good, let's get shit faced.


216
00:11:58.766 --> 00:11:59.933
Let's.

217
00:12:07.507 --> 00:12:08.942
Wow.

218
00:12:08.976 --> 00:12:10.143
Tada.

219
00:12:10.177 --> 00:12:11.378
Are they started already?

220
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:14.014
Ah, get a room you two, honestly.

221
00:12:14.047 --> 00:12:16.483
Now that's a good idea.

222
00:12:16.516 --> 00:12:18.485
Hey, you.

223
00:12:18.518 --> 00:12:20.821
Found their password yet?

224
00:12:20.854 --> 00:12:24.391
Idiots.

225
00:12:24.424 --> 00:12:25.959
- Hey, bro.
- Tess, let me get you a drink.


226
00:12:25.993 --> 00:12:27.527
It's been awhile man,
how's things at the mill?


227
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.962
You know, same old.

228
00:12:28.996 --> 00:12:30.463
Old man's still busting my balls.

229
00:12:30.497 --> 00:12:32.900
Yeah it's a bummer
you had to drop out.

230
00:12:32.933 --> 00:12:35.769
- Hey, beverage?
- Brought my own mixer.


231
00:12:35.803 --> 00:12:37.404
Oh, how obliging.

232
00:12:37.437 --> 00:12:39.406
I saw your slice and dice
stunt on Screen-It.


233
00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:41.074
Yeah, some roadkill I found.

234
00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:43.076
Frozen solid then put it
through the big kahuna blade.


235
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.245
- Instant anatomy lesson.
- Yeah, hey, got it up.


236
00:12:45.278 --> 00:12:46.413
Look, look, look, look, look.

237
00:12:46.446 --> 00:12:49.416
Shut up back there okay
just, fuck off, okay.


238
00:12:49.449 --> 00:12:52.920
- Oh, God.
- Okay, let's do it.


239
00:12:55.155 --> 00:12:56.256
You're a sick man.

240
00:12:58.325 --> 00:12:59.092
It gets better.

241
00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:00.327
It doesn't even have a heart.

242
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.062
Wait for it, wait for it.

243
00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:07.300
You did not just do that.

244
00:13:07.334 --> 00:13:09.102
Can't believe I watched that.

245
00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:11.905
Seriously, we, no.

246
00:13:11.939 --> 00:13:14.141
Marty, load these up, more PG friendly.

247
00:13:14.174 --> 00:13:15.809
- Ugh.
- I'm gonna be scared for life.


248
00:13:15.843 --> 00:13:16.977
We are wired and ready to roll.

249
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.013
These should up the party ante.

250
00:13:20.047 --> 00:13:23.083
You're a bad girl, Jules.

251
00:13:23.116 --> 00:13:25.585
This is pretty hard-core, huh?

252
00:13:25.618 --> 00:13:28.055
This is some serious setup dude.

253
00:13:28.088 --> 00:13:29.990
Everything controlled
by my trusty mobile.


254
00:13:30.023 --> 00:13:32.059
I've got my whole house setup back home.

255
00:13:32.092 --> 00:13:33.326
Hey which one do you wanna start with?

256
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.361
Crazy Japanese Show.

257
00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:35.528
Oh, my God, I love that show.

258
00:13:35.562 --> 00:13:37.230
Hey have guys seen
the J-Pop girls?


259
00:13:37.264 --> 00:13:38.065
Speed?

260
00:13:38.098 --> 00:13:40.067
- Yes.
- It's so tacky it's delicious.


261
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.534
- How good is it.
- That is cool.


262
00:13:41.568 --> 00:13:44.004
Hey are we all set to
live-cast our party later?


263
00:13:44.037 --> 00:13:45.338
All set to Screen
-It.

264
00:13:45.372 --> 00:13:48.241
Hey, guys, get closer,
let's immortalize the crime.


265
00:13:48.275 --> 00:13:49.309
Let's do it.

266
00:13:57.617 --> 00:14:00.553
That's going straight to Facebook.

267
00:14:00.587 --> 00:14:03.356
Time to get off
your face-book.


268
00:14:04.657 --> 00:14:05.792
Hey, that was awesome,

269
00:14:05.825 --> 00:14:08.595
but that takes time so here's
one I prepared earlier.


270
00:14:08.628 --> 00:14:09.963
Uh-huh.

271
00:14:21.308 --> 00:14:23.176
Hey, pizza's here.

272
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.612
- Pizza!
- Ah, pizza.


273
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.217
Kyle, it's your dad man, your dad.

274
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.120
I diverted my phone, come on.

275
00:14:33.153 --> 00:14:35.088
Everyone shut the fuck up.

276
00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:43.463
Pollock residence.

277
00:14:43.496 --> 00:14:45.298
Hi, Helen, it's Mike Gruper here.

278
00:14:45.332 --> 00:14:48.101
Hi, Mike, I suppose you're after Kyle.

279
00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:51.471
They're playing games upstairs, hang on.

280
00:14:53.373 --> 00:14:55.208
That is fucking wild.

281
00:14:55.242 --> 00:14:56.944
- Shh.
- How did you do that?


282
00:14:56.977 --> 00:14:59.379
I hacked an automated
SKYPE message bank app.


283
00:14:59.412 --> 00:15:02.549
Shut up, shut up.
All right.


284
00:15:04.985 --> 00:15:06.686
Hi, Dad, what's up?
You checkin' up on me?


285
00:15:06.719 --> 00:15:09.256
Well, what do you think after
what happened in the pool today?


286
00:15:09.289 --> 00:15:11.624
Look, just wanted to
remind you we have a 6:00AM


287
00:15:11.658 --> 00:15:15.162
start tomorrow, so don't stay
up all night playing games.


288
00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:17.230
Okay, Dad, is that it?

289
00:15:17.264 --> 00:15:20.467
Okay, now I expect a PB tomorrow.

290
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.235
Okay, Dad.
Can I go now?


291
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:23.536
I'll see you in the morning.

292
00:15:26.606 --> 00:15:29.076
- That is cool.
- What!


293
00:15:29.109 --> 00:15:31.511
The things you can do with
open-source code and Bluetooth.


294
00:15:31.544 --> 00:15:33.580
I think I'll have that joint now.

295
00:15:33.613 --> 00:15:35.248
That's tweet-worthy even.

296
00:15:35.282 --> 00:15:37.217
It's like the modern
equivalent of a forged note.


297
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.451
I think I'll join you.

298
00:15:38.485 --> 00:15:40.253
What about your PB tomorrow?

299
00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:42.956
Tomorrow, I'm going for a PB tonight.

300
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.625
No smoking inside, okay?
Go out back.


301
00:15:45.658 --> 00:15:46.626
Yes, mom.

302
00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:49.062
Sorry. Coming?

303
00:15:49.096 --> 00:15:50.230
It's not my thing.

304
00:15:50.263 --> 00:15:52.232
Asthma's a bitch.

305
00:15:52.265 --> 00:15:54.234
Better get you
shit-faced then.


306
00:15:55.535 --> 00:15:56.369
Oh, my God, they've got a pool.

307
00:15:56.403 --> 00:15:58.138
- What?
- Come on!


308
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:05.312
* Na na na na
na na na na na *

309
00:16:11.351 --> 00:16:14.221
* Watch out your mummy's eyes

310
00:16:14.254 --> 00:16:16.323
* Better make up good lies

311
00:16:16.356 --> 00:16:18.291
* Sneak away from home

312
00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:21.461
* It's time for the sunshine drive *

313
00:16:21.494 --> 00:16:24.197
* Don't care about your money

314
00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:26.766
* Don't care about your honey

315
00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:28.468
* Boys are in a queue

316
00:16:28.501 --> 00:16:31.271
* It's time for the sunshine drive *

317
00:16:32.139 --> 00:16:33.140
* First stop frozen tequila

318
00:16:33.173 --> 00:16:36.476
* Second stop Melbourne bitter *

319
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:39.179
* Third stop cowboy cocksucker *

320
00:16:39.212 --> 00:16:41.448
* Oh, yeah

321
00:16:43.383 --> 00:16:45.585
* Gabba, gabba, hey, 
Kat, get right *

322
00:16:46.719 --> 00:16:49.356
* It's time for the sunshine drive *

323
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:51.558
* Hey, Lucy, get spazzy

324
00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:54.261
* It's time for the sunshine drive *

325
00:16:54.294 --> 00:16:56.463
* Hey, Ally, don't worry

326
00:16:56.496 --> 00:16:59.099
* It's time for the sunshine drive *

327
00:16:59.132 --> 00:17:01.534
* We're the Spazzys and we're ready *

328
00:17:01.568 --> 00:17:04.037
* Let's go to the sunshine drive *

329
00:17:05.105 --> 00:17:09.008
* Na na na na
na na na na na

330
00:17:11.344 --> 00:17:13.080
So sexy...

331
00:17:13.113 --> 00:17:14.481
Oh, dude, this is the
song they sing, oh...


332
00:17:14.514 --> 00:17:15.782
Oh.

333
00:17:18.385 --> 00:17:19.786
Shh.

334
00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:23.623
This is how we party Oak Bay style.

335
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:10.069
Marty?

336
00:18:11.604 --> 00:18:13.072
Anyone?

337
00:18:16.543 --> 00:18:17.810
Hello?

338
00:18:21.314 --> 00:18:23.350
Ha-ha, very funny.

339
00:18:26.219 --> 00:18:28.621
Quit messing around, guys.

340
00:18:39.566 --> 00:18:41.334
Hey, Brie.

341
00:18:41.368 --> 00:18:45.338
What?

342
00:18:46.739 --> 00:18:49.242
Marty, you're such a jerk.

343
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.357
Marty?

344
00:19:06.593 --> 00:19:08.161
Jules?

345
00:19:09.762 --> 00:19:11.231
Stu?

346
00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:16.636
Where are you guys?

347
00:19:58.345 --> 00:20:04.284
Six blind mice, no where to run.

348
00:20:04.317 --> 00:20:06.753
Who'll be the first
one to start crying...


349
00:20:06.786 --> 00:20:08.163
Marty?

350
00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:12.294
...when they discover
they're all going to die?


351
00:20:12.325 --> 00:20:16.729
Oh, dear, poor little mice.

352
00:20:16.763 --> 00:20:20.500
The fate of your friends
is in your hands, Brie.


353
00:20:20.533 --> 00:20:23.436
- Marty?
- If you're clever enough,


354
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.273
and if you play by the rules,

355
00:20:26.906 --> 00:20:30.343
no parents, no authorities.

356
00:20:30.377 --> 00:20:34.481
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

357
00:20:35.482 --> 00:20:36.583
What?

358
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:51.464
The number you have dialed

359
00:20:51.498 --> 00:20:55.402
is currently switched off or
not in a mobile serviced area.


360
00:20:55.435 --> 00:20:57.504
Please call again later.

361
00:21:24.997 --> 00:21:26.366
Guys?

362
00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:36.643
Daddy.

363
00:21:40.713 --> 00:21:42.281
Ow.

364
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:45.485
Ow.

365
00:21:47.354 --> 00:21:50.657
Hey, you got me.

366
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.561
That's going to leave
a good welt on my head.


367
00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.966
Guys, hey.

368
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.506
Can you hear me?

369
00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:07.874
The number you have dialed

370
00:22:07.907 --> 00:22:10.510
is currently switched off or
not in a mobile serviced area.


371
00:22:10.543 --> 00:22:12.912
What? Jesus.

372
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.969
Hey, can you hear me?

373
00:22:54.787 --> 00:22:56.355
Hey.

374
00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.858
Hey!

375
00:23:02.595 --> 00:23:03.596
Help.

376
00:23:36.729 --> 00:23:37.897
Guys?

377
00:23:39.532 --> 00:23:41.734
What the fuck is going on?

378
00:23:43.135 --> 00:23:44.671
Hello?

379
00:23:58.518 --> 00:23:59.986
Kyle, you wanker.

380
00:24:00.019 --> 00:24:01.754
Hello.

381
00:24:01.788 --> 00:24:04.056
Are you enjoying this little game?

382
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.594
- What the fuck?
- I know I am.


383
00:24:07.627 --> 00:24:11.898
By the way, there are only
two rules in this game.


384
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:14.701
Rule number one, no parents.

385
00:24:14.734 --> 00:24:18.471
Rule number two, no authorities.

386
00:24:18.505 --> 00:24:22.108
- Listen here, you little shit.
- Simple isn't it?


387
00:24:22.141 --> 00:24:23.710
Have fun.

388
00:24:38.525 --> 00:24:39.659
Breezer?

389
00:24:40.793 --> 00:24:41.661
It's kind of late isn't it?

390
00:24:41.694 --> 00:24:45.164
Yeah, well, must have
lost track of time.


391
00:24:45.197 --> 00:24:47.133
Are you okay?
Have you been drinking?


392
00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:49.769
No, no, God no.

393
00:24:49.802 --> 00:24:51.270
I've been at Jules' place.

394
00:24:51.303 --> 00:24:53.906
But Jules' place is on Carlson Road.

395
00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.508
I took the scenic route.

396
00:24:55.542 --> 00:24:58.645
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna follow you home


397
00:24:58.678 --> 00:24:59.779
and make sure you get there safe.

398
00:24:59.812 --> 00:25:00.980
Dane, look I'm fine, honestly.

399
00:25:01.013 --> 00:25:03.750
Look, I'm going to do this.

400
00:25:03.783 --> 00:25:07.554
I'm not gonna ask
any questions, capiche?


401
00:25:22.234 --> 00:25:23.703
Daddy!

402
00:25:37.717 --> 00:25:44.023
Uh...
it sounds kind of hollow.


403
00:25:44.056 --> 00:25:45.291
Bye, Brie.

404
00:25:45.324 --> 00:25:48.728
Hey, hey, hang on, you're breaking up.

405
00:25:48.761 --> 00:25:52.865
I think the door closer is
interfering or something.


406
00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:55.101
Brie, I wouldn't mess around
with this sort of shit, okay?


407
00:25:55.134 --> 00:25:57.870
I really am in some sort of box.

408
00:25:57.904 --> 00:26:00.607
I got this freaky video...

409
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.908
Hello?

410
00:26:02.942 --> 00:26:03.910
Brie?

411
00:26:25.264 --> 00:26:26.733
Hi.

412
00:26:35.341 --> 00:26:39.612
Brie... check this out.

413
00:26:47.654 --> 00:26:52.291
- Holy shit, you're in a box.
- No shit, Sherlock.


414
00:26:52.324 --> 00:26:55.327
How?
I don't get it, we were--


415
00:26:55.361 --> 00:26:58.097
Look I am freaking out
here, you have to find me.


416
00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:02.101
I woke up in that house
all alone and you guys had gone.


417
00:27:02.134 --> 00:27:03.169
What am I going to do?

418
00:27:03.202 --> 00:27:04.837
I have no fucking idea.

419
00:27:04.871 --> 00:27:08.841
The last thing...
Oh, my God.


420
00:27:12.845 --> 00:27:15.648
I don't remember.

421
00:27:15.682 --> 00:27:20.319
Um, okay,
something odd is going on here.


422
00:27:20.352 --> 00:27:23.289
I have erratic phone coverage
and there is no data connection,


423
00:27:23.322 --> 00:27:25.925
I'm surprised the MMS got through.

424
00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:28.961
Marty, what am I supposed to do?

425
00:27:30.963 --> 00:27:32.331
Did you get the other message?

426
00:27:32.364 --> 00:27:35.101
The smiley face thing
with you guys all in boxes?


427
00:27:35.134 --> 00:27:38.037
Yeah, I though that was
a joke, I thought you--


428
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:43.109
Brie, hey, whoa, whoa,
hey all... wait, all of us?


429
00:27:43.142 --> 00:27:44.977
Yeah my message said the fate

430
00:27:45.011 --> 00:27:47.980
of your friends is in your hands.

431
00:27:48.014 --> 00:27:49.415
Friends as in plural.

432
00:27:49.448 --> 00:27:53.019
And then it had a montage
of images of you guys


433
00:27:53.052 --> 00:27:54.787
all in boxes.

434
00:27:55.822 --> 00:27:58.958
Oh, God, this is real.

435
00:27:58.991 --> 00:28:02.829
That's different to mine.
Send it to me.


436
00:28:02.862 --> 00:28:04.931
What the hell's going on?

437
00:28:04.964 --> 00:28:06.999
Brie, we need you.

438
00:28:09.035 --> 00:28:11.203
You know, I knew something was up,

439
00:28:11.237 --> 00:28:15.374
you'd never leave your
lappy and your PS3 behind.


440
00:28:15.407 --> 00:28:17.710
At least you're safe.

441
00:28:19.846 --> 00:28:23.182
Hey, listen, tell the others
not to use video call,


442
00:28:23.215 --> 00:28:25.184
it chews through the
battery and we need--


443
00:28:25.217 --> 00:28:27.820
Hello?

444
00:28:27.854 --> 00:28:29.121
Hello?

445
00:28:29.155 --> 00:28:30.422
Brie.

446
00:28:38.998 --> 00:28:40.985
The number you have dialed is

447
00:28:40.987 --> 00:28:43.403
currently switched off
or not in a mobile--


448
00:29:19.138 --> 00:29:20.139
Hey.

449
00:29:27.579 --> 00:29:29.015
Hey.

450
00:30:13.025 --> 00:30:15.361
- Tess?
- Dad, you've gotta help me.


451
00:30:15.394 --> 00:30:17.396
What do ya mean sweetheart,
what's going on?


452
00:30:17.429 --> 00:30:22.168
I don't know, I just woke up
and I'm locked in a box.


453
00:30:22.201 --> 00:30:23.035
I'm so scared.

454
00:30:23.069 --> 00:30:24.170
What do you mean
you're locked in a box?

455
00:30:24.203 --> 00:30:26.405
What are you... sweetheart,

456
00:30:26.438 --> 00:30:28.140
have you been taking drugs or something?

457
00:30:28.174 --> 00:30:32.378
Um... I was at a party
and I don't know what happened.


458
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:33.612
I don't remember anything.

459
00:30:33.645 --> 00:30:35.281
Hang on, hang on, just calm down.

460
00:30:35.314 --> 00:30:38.050
So you're telling me
that you were at a party


461
00:30:38.084 --> 00:30:39.852
and someone put you in a box.

462
00:30:39.886 --> 00:30:41.053
I mean can't you get out of it?

463
00:30:41.087 --> 00:30:42.889
What is it, a cardboard box or what?

464
00:30:42.922 --> 00:30:45.357
No, it's like a wooden box.

465
00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:49.561
I really don't know what happened, Dad.

466
00:30:51.163 --> 00:30:53.332
It smells funny, it's musty.

467
00:30:53.365 --> 00:30:55.367
- So you're telling me--
- Just hang on a second, okay?


468
00:30:55.401 --> 00:30:57.236
I've got a message,
I'm gonna put you on hold.


469
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:58.370
It might be the others.

470
00:30:58.404 --> 00:30:59.872
Others, sweetheart
what do you mean by--


471
00:31:03.109 --> 00:31:06.278
There are only two rules in this game.

472
00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:09.081
Rule number one, no parents.

473
00:31:09.115 --> 00:31:13.185
Rule number two, no authorities.

474
00:31:13.219 --> 00:31:16.889
Simple isn't it?
Have fun.


475
00:31:24.596 --> 00:31:27.633
This better not be a joke, young lady.

476
00:31:44.183 --> 00:31:48.220
I do hope you like
the perfume you're wearing.


477
00:31:48.254 --> 00:31:52.992
It's the very best,
it will light up your day.


478
00:31:55.527 --> 00:31:58.130
Hello, help me.

479
00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:04.370
Oak Bay police department,
Nardine Walsh speaking.


480
00:32:04.403 --> 00:32:05.604
Hey, Dad.

481
00:32:05.637 --> 00:32:08.140
Nardine, it's Gary,
just hang on a sec will you?


482
00:32:08.174 --> 00:32:09.341
Sweetheart?

483
00:32:09.375 --> 00:32:11.510
- Dad, I've messed up.
- Hey, hey, slow down.


484
00:32:11.543 --> 00:32:13.245
Please tell me you didn't call anyone.

485
00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:15.247
No, I haven't, but I've got
Nardine on the other phone.


486
00:32:15.281 --> 00:32:17.049
No, no, no, you can't tell anybody.

487
00:32:17.083 --> 00:32:18.017
Okay.

488
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:19.151
Seriously, you can't tell anybody.

489
00:32:19.185 --> 00:32:20.286
Okay, okay, I get it.

490
00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:22.421
Just hang on, hang on.

491
00:32:22.454 --> 00:32:24.156
Nardine, I'm sorry, just a false alarm.

492
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.126
Turns out Tess is at a friend's place.

493
00:32:27.159 --> 00:32:29.695
You want Dane to
go and check on 'em?

494
00:32:29.728 --> 00:32:31.630
No, no, I'll go
and pick her up now.

495
00:32:31.663 --> 00:32:34.200
Things we do for our kids, eh, sarge?

496
00:32:34.233 --> 00:32:35.334
You know, my Philip--

497
00:32:35.367 --> 00:32:37.169
Yeah, wouldn't want it any other way.

498
00:32:37.203 --> 00:32:40.672
Look, nothing unusual to report
down there, everything okay?


499
00:32:40.706 --> 00:32:43.742
It's been quiet actually.
A bit bored really,


500
00:32:43.775 --> 00:32:45.211
I've been trying to get
on the internet but--


501
00:32:45.244 --> 00:32:46.712
Right, right, good, well, 
I've gotta go.

502
00:32:46.745 --> 00:32:50.016
We did have one... Hello?

503
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.220
- Sweetheart?
- Dad, it's all right. I'm okay.


504
00:32:54.253 --> 00:32:57.356
From the start,
tell me what the message said.


505
00:32:57.389 --> 00:33:00.226
No, dammit, Jules,
you can't call your dad.


506
00:33:00.259 --> 00:33:02.461
They might be listening.

507
00:33:03.695 --> 00:33:06.732
I mean how do we
even know this is real?

508
00:33:06.765 --> 00:33:09.468
How can they be monitoring
all of our calls, it's crazy.


509
00:33:09.501 --> 00:33:12.704
Do you wanna take that risk?
Think, Jules.


510
00:33:14.106 --> 00:33:15.741
Have you spoken to the others?

511
00:33:15.774 --> 00:33:16.875
I spoke briefly to Amy.

512
00:33:16.908 --> 00:33:22.648
Oh, so you call her before
you call your girlfriend.


513
00:33:23.382 --> 00:33:25.351
She called me.

514
00:33:25.384 --> 00:33:27.319
She said she could smell petrol,

515
00:33:27.353 --> 00:33:29.421
I told her not to use her phone,

516
00:33:29.455 --> 00:33:32.258
it could cause a spark.

517
00:33:32.291 --> 00:33:34.726
The petrol's burning my skin.

518
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.230
Kyle said not to make anymore
calls, but I'm so scared.


519
00:33:40.232 --> 00:33:44.670
I mean, why the fuck would
they cover me in petrol, Brie?


520
00:33:44.703 --> 00:33:47.706
Just, sit tight Ames, okay?

521
00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:50.342
Marty said to get us all
on a conference call,


522
00:33:50.376 --> 00:33:52.244
rather than everyone wasting
precious battery life


523
00:33:52.278 --> 00:33:53.612
calling each other.

524
00:33:53.645 --> 00:33:56.582
Well, I think my credit's low.

525
00:33:56.615 --> 00:33:58.817
Just hurry up, okay?

526
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:00.752
Please hurry up.

527
00:34:00.786 --> 00:34:02.288
I'm trying, all right?

528
00:34:02.321 --> 00:34:04.656
I don't... I...

529
00:34:48.334 --> 00:34:52.271
You need to calm down,
I'd gladly swap positions.


530
00:34:52.304 --> 00:34:53.605
I can't.

531
00:34:57.176 --> 00:35:01.713
Bullshit. Of course you can.

532
00:35:01.747 --> 00:35:04.716
Don't sell yourself short,
you are stronger than you think.


533
00:35:06.352 --> 00:35:08.720
It's what I dig about you.

534
00:35:12.358 --> 00:35:13.325
Okay.

535
00:35:14.426 --> 00:35:16.628
Say it with gusto.

536
00:35:16.662 --> 00:35:18.397
Okay!

537
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:19.798
Thank God.

538
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:26.472
Now, you realize it's you and me.

539
00:35:27.939 --> 00:35:31.210
No one else is going
to get us out of this.


540
00:35:31.243 --> 00:35:33.479
So you need to focus.

541
00:35:36.448 --> 00:35:38.284
Yeah, I tried,

542
00:35:38.317 --> 00:35:40.919
the only other person I
can get through to is Kyle.


543
00:35:40.952 --> 00:35:44.890
He said his is wet.
Mine just smells.


544
00:35:46.525 --> 00:35:49.828
It's like I'm buried, but
there's light coming through.


545
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:51.363
Smelly?

546
00:35:51.397 --> 00:35:52.664
Are you serious?

547
00:35:52.698 --> 00:35:55.401
I'm basted and ready to cook here.

548
00:35:55.434 --> 00:35:58.670
It's not all about you Ames.

549
00:35:58.704 --> 00:36:00.606
There's bigger picture
stuff going on here.


550
00:36:02.908 --> 00:36:05.644
Hey, I've been trying to call.
Have you heard from Tess?


551
00:36:05.677 --> 00:36:06.912
No, her line's busy.

552
00:36:06.945 --> 00:36:08.514
Breezer's still trying.

553
00:36:08.547 --> 00:36:10.482
We're going to do a
conference hookup thing


554
00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:13.319
and figure this out,
so keep the line free.


555
00:36:13.352 --> 00:36:16.455
Man, I don't remember
anything after those pills.


556
00:36:16.488 --> 00:36:18.657
Just stay cool, we'll talk in a minute.

557
00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:22.261
Hey, I was gonna call my cousin,
he's into technology and stuff


558
00:36:22.294 --> 00:36:24.930
and I thought he might be able to find
us using some triangulation shit.


559
00:36:24.963 --> 00:36:29.435
Don't call anyone yet,
just keep it together, man.


560
00:36:53.992 --> 00:36:57.529
- You wanna see it?
- Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.


561
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:59.465
Wait, what's that, what's that?

562
00:36:59.498 --> 00:37:01.400
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah.


563
00:37:01.433 --> 00:37:02.434
Dude, come on, click.

564
00:37:02.468 --> 00:37:04.403
Yeah, okay, okay.

565
00:37:09.675 --> 00:37:11.543
Still can't get on to Tess,

566
00:37:11.577 --> 00:37:14.513
but Marty and I thought
it was imperative that


567
00:37:14.546 --> 00:37:15.647
we're all brought up to speed.

568
00:37:15.681 --> 00:37:17.583
Up to speed?

569
00:37:17.616 --> 00:37:20.352
We're all fucked, is that
up to speed enough for you?


570
00:37:20.386 --> 00:37:21.753
Let her speak.

571
00:37:21.787 --> 00:37:24.390
For all we know
Brie's in on this shit.

572
00:37:24.423 --> 00:37:27.626
What makes her so special
not to get fucking taken.


573
00:37:27.659 --> 00:37:31.530
- Shut up, Jules.
- Yeah, shut up.


574
00:37:31.563 --> 00:37:35.401
I think we all realize this
is either some sick prank


575
00:37:35.434 --> 00:37:38.003
or something freaky is going on.

576
00:37:38.036 --> 00:37:39.571
You got that right.

577
00:37:39.605 --> 00:37:42.674
I'm covered in fucking petrol.

578
00:37:42.708 --> 00:37:45.311
Okay, we're gonna go around, um,

579
00:37:45.344 --> 00:37:46.745
systematically, one by one,

580
00:37:46.778 --> 00:37:50.416
and you tell me what
you see, what you smell,


581
00:37:50.449 --> 00:37:52.751
- stuff like that.
- We're wasting time.


582
00:37:52.784 --> 00:37:54.620
How the fuck else do
you think we are going


583
00:37:54.653 --> 00:37:56.955
to work this out unless we
get all our info sorted, huh?


584
00:37:56.988 --> 00:37:59.591
We should call the
cops and take the risk.


585
00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:02.328
Last time I checked cops
were filed under authorities.


586
00:38:02.361 --> 00:38:04.563
Use your head for once in
your perfect little life.


587
00:38:04.596 --> 00:38:08.667
Okay, okay, Jules.

588
00:38:09.401 --> 00:38:11.470
Marty's right.

589
00:38:11.503 --> 00:38:12.604
We all have to calm down.

590
00:38:12.638 --> 00:38:14.039
Oh, that's fine for you, Brie,

591
00:38:14.072 --> 00:38:15.741
you're not the one in a fucking box.

592
00:38:15.774 --> 00:38:17.476
My box is damp.

593
00:38:17.509 --> 00:38:21.580
It's leaking,
there's water in the bottom.


594
00:38:21.613 --> 00:38:24.783
I'm laying in a few
centimeters of water.


595
00:38:24.816 --> 00:38:28.019
Um, I can't hear
much but I don't know,

596
00:38:28.053 --> 00:38:30.088
I could be in a sewer.

597
00:38:30.121 --> 00:38:32.057
I think I'm floating.

598
00:38:33.058 --> 00:38:34.626
Okay, good.

599
00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.095
Either way, I'm definitely
not out in the open.


600
00:38:37.128 --> 00:38:38.497
Yeah, me too.

601
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.532
All I can smell is fresh varnish

602
00:38:40.566 --> 00:38:42.434
and the timber of the box.

603
00:38:42.468 --> 00:38:44.002
I can't hear anything, it's dead quiet.

604
00:38:44.035 --> 00:38:48.574
As I said, I'm covered in
petrol, it really stings,


605
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:51.710
and it smells, um,

606
00:38:52.644 --> 00:38:54.746
I don't think I'm buried.

607
00:38:58.584 --> 00:39:00.819
Maybe this is some sort of satanic cult.

608
00:39:00.852 --> 00:39:03.522
Focus, people.

609
00:39:05.156 --> 00:39:06.525
Marty?

610
00:39:08.694 --> 00:39:11.963
All I know is, I'm in a box.

611
00:39:11.997 --> 00:39:14.500
There's something around my feet though.

612
00:39:15.934 --> 00:39:20.539
I can't see what it is, it sort
of disappears underneath me.


613
00:39:25.744 --> 00:39:28.113
Jules?
What's happening?


614
00:39:29.147 --> 00:39:30.516
Hello?

615
00:39:31.149 --> 00:39:32.551
Is anyone there?

616
00:39:32.984 --> 00:39:34.720
Hello?

617
00:39:37.623 --> 00:39:39.925
The rules have been broken.

618
00:39:39.958 --> 00:39:43.695
So every one must be sacrificed.

619
00:39:43.729 --> 00:39:46.598
Whom should I choose first?

620
00:39:46.632 --> 00:39:53.405
Eenie meenie minnie mo,
who will be the first to go?


621
00:39:53.439 --> 00:39:57.476
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

622
00:40:40.852 --> 00:40:42.053
Fuck.

623
00:41:01.673 --> 00:41:03.208
Fuck off.

624
00:41:11.717 --> 00:41:14.720
Little fucking bastards.

625
00:41:40.679 --> 00:41:43.782
Oh, that's just lovely.

626
00:42:55.754 --> 00:42:57.656
I've got a gun.

627
00:42:57.689 --> 00:42:58.590
Who is it?

628
00:42:58.624 --> 00:43:01.359
You don't have a gun, Brie,
it's Gary Hart.


629
00:43:01.392 --> 00:43:04.029
I know what's going on,
I've spoken to Tess.


630
00:43:07.966 --> 00:43:11.202
Thank God you've spoken to her. No
one's been able to get through.


631
00:43:11.236 --> 00:43:12.838
I'm so glad to see you.

632
00:43:12.871 --> 00:43:15.306
Brie.
What the hell's happened?


633
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.309
I mean the last thing I heard
there's a girl's video night here,


634
00:43:18.343 --> 00:43:20.746
and then next thing Tess
is in some box somewhere.


635
00:43:20.779 --> 00:43:22.648
Oh, the warning.

636
00:43:22.681 --> 00:43:24.883
She called before she read the message.

637
00:43:24.916 --> 00:43:27.853
Of course she's going to call
her father, she didn't know.


638
00:43:27.886 --> 00:43:29.354
Now we've lost contact.

639
00:43:29.387 --> 00:43:31.823
Yes, I know,
I've been trying to call her.


640
00:43:35.326 --> 00:43:37.128
Where are your parents?

641
00:43:37.162 --> 00:43:40.131
Dad's cousin's wedding,
they're staying the night.


642
00:43:40.165 --> 00:43:41.900
So where was the real party?

643
00:43:41.933 --> 00:43:45.871
This swish place down by the beach.

644
00:43:45.904 --> 00:43:47.706
But there's nothing there, I checked.

645
00:43:47.739 --> 00:43:48.840
What, nothing, no boxes, or nothing?

646
00:43:48.874 --> 00:43:50.275
Nothing.

647
00:43:50.308 --> 00:43:53.745
Look, I'm sorry,
this wasn't meant to happen.


648
00:43:53.779 --> 00:43:56.982
It was just meant to
be a bit of fun.

649
00:43:59.384 --> 00:44:02.888
Fuck...

650
00:44:20.171 --> 00:44:24.009
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

651
00:44:24.042 --> 00:44:26.878
Who will be the first to go?

652
00:44:29.047 --> 00:44:30.949
Shit.

653
00:44:32.117 --> 00:44:33.284
Hello?

654
00:44:35.153 --> 00:44:37.889
Hey, hello?

655
00:44:40.158 --> 00:44:44.429
Hey... Hello, help.

656
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.331
I'm in here.

657
00:44:46.364 --> 00:44:48.800
So what's all this then?

658
00:44:48.834 --> 00:44:52.237
I've been getting them
to tell me where they are.


659
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.006
Like it or not, 
I'm involved now.

660
00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.878
We've already broken two rules so I
better make damn sure it's worth it.


661
00:45:01.046 --> 00:45:02.948
Bring me up to speed.

662
00:45:02.981 --> 00:45:07.052
Hey, hey.

663
00:45:09.354 --> 00:45:11.322
I'm... hello?

664
00:45:11.356 --> 00:45:14.159
Help, help, I need help.

665
00:45:14.192 --> 00:45:16.127
Come on, please.

666
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:26.838
Fuck.

667
00:45:27.906 --> 00:45:29.440
Hello?

668
00:45:29.474 --> 00:45:34.312
I know you're out there,
help me, help me!


669
00:45:34.345 --> 00:45:37.315
Help, please, help.

670
00:45:38.316 --> 00:45:40.318
Say a last farewell

671
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:42.453
to one of your friends.

672
00:45:43.421 --> 00:45:45.390
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

673
00:45:45.423 --> 00:45:48.827
Please, my parents
will pay you, I swear.


674
00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.964
I don't care who
you are, just help me.

675
00:45:52.998 --> 00:45:56.167
Please, please let me out.

676
00:45:57.135 --> 00:45:58.536
No.

677
00:45:58.569 --> 00:46:00.271
No!

678
00:46:00.305 --> 00:46:01.773
No, no, no.

679
00:46:01.807 --> 00:46:03.208
Let me out, let me out.

680
00:46:05.877 --> 00:46:07.345
Please stop!

681
00:46:09.147 --> 00:46:11.116
- Oh, please.
- Oh, God.


682
00:46:12.984 --> 00:46:14.019
Oh, God.

683
00:46:16.087 --> 00:46:17.522
No!

684
00:46:37.142 --> 00:46:39.377
Ah, who are they kidding?

685
00:47:31.129 --> 00:47:32.430
Mother fucker.

686
00:47:46.044 --> 00:47:48.646
2-1-7 to Oak Bay, over.

687
00:47:48.679 --> 00:47:51.216
Yes, Dane, nice music.

688
00:47:51.249 --> 00:47:55.120
Yeah, we have a possible 6-1-1
in progress at Jeffrey's Point.


689
00:47:55.153 --> 00:47:57.655
I am on route to investigate.

690
00:47:57.688 --> 00:48:02.060
You're going to investigate someone
dressed as a police officer?


691
00:48:02.093 --> 00:48:05.931
Sorry, that would be um,
that would be a 6...


692
00:48:05.964 --> 00:48:09.367
6-0-1, I'd like
to request fire services.


693
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.037
Must be one hell of a stray animal.

694
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.605
Nardine, I see a suspicious fire, okay?

695
00:48:14.639 --> 00:48:18.243
Okay, well, that
would be a 4-0-4.


696
00:48:18.276 --> 00:48:21.112
How 'bout you go check it
out and let me know, okay?


697
00:48:21.146 --> 00:48:22.413
Yeah, yeah.

698
00:48:34.225 --> 00:48:37.963
Now, luckily, the jammer
I have will send all your calls


699
00:48:37.996 --> 00:48:39.931
and messages through your voice mail.

700
00:48:39.965 --> 00:48:43.368
So I am not denying service,
I am simply diverting.


701
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:54.980
Yes, Nardine, I've got it, thank you.

702
00:48:56.214 --> 00:48:57.382
Dane's on his way to the fire.

703
00:48:57.415 --> 00:49:01.086
I've got to call Don Challis
and get him down to the station.


704
00:49:31.249 --> 00:49:32.517
Yes.

705
00:49:57.442 --> 00:49:59.244
Oh, man.

706
00:50:04.182 --> 00:50:05.650
Oh, geez, Louise!

707
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:34.011
It was stupid and...
now Ames is dead.


708
00:50:34.779 --> 00:50:37.182
I woke up and called Dad, that's it.

709
00:50:38.683 --> 00:50:40.385
Did you see her burn?

710
00:50:40.418 --> 00:50:41.786
Stop it, Jules.

711
00:50:41.819 --> 00:50:44.189
I called Dad before I got the message,

712
00:50:44.222 --> 00:50:45.656
what do you want me to say?

713
00:50:47.225 --> 00:50:51.529
The fact is, Ames is dead
and it's your fault.


714
00:50:54.399 --> 00:50:56.134
I mean the one person who
shouldn't have been called,


715
00:50:56.167 --> 00:50:57.468
both a cop and a parent.

716
00:50:57.502 --> 00:51:00.338
She wasn't to know, I mean...

717
00:51:00.371 --> 00:51:02.473
...her first reaction
was to call her dad.


718
00:51:02.507 --> 00:51:04.575
Well, now we're all fucked.

719
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:07.044
What's Hart going to do anyway?

720
00:51:08.746 --> 00:51:10.748
- Is this is?
- Yeah.


721
00:51:13.784 --> 00:51:15.620
It was attached to your phone line.

722
00:51:15.653 --> 00:51:17.722
Looks like there are three cameras,

723
00:51:17.755 --> 00:51:20.325
one in the vent in the living room,

724
00:51:20.358 --> 00:51:22.460
one facing out the front of the house,

725
00:51:23.628 --> 00:51:26.531
and this one here, in your bedroom.

726
00:51:27.432 --> 00:51:28.799
Are you serious?

727
00:51:28.833 --> 00:51:31.536
It's a god damn body, Nardine.

728
00:51:31.569 --> 00:51:33.338
Somebody's been burned alive.

729
00:51:33.371 --> 00:51:35.540
Sorry, Dane,
could you repeat that please?


730
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:40.511
I'm about a 100 yards
off Riverside Road,


731
00:51:40.545 --> 00:51:42.813
just before Jeffrey's Point.

732
00:51:42.847 --> 00:51:44.615
I found a body.

733
00:51:44.649 --> 00:51:46.284
Pretty messed up.

734
00:51:47.318 --> 00:51:50.855
Look, I also found
evidence of a fuel can.


735
00:51:52.423 --> 00:51:55.760
The body was in a box or something.

736
00:51:58.429 --> 00:52:01.799
Man, it...
it really stinks.


737
00:52:04.369 --> 00:52:07.672
It... may be my daughter.

738
00:52:07.705 --> 00:52:10.641
Oh, Don...

739
00:52:10.675 --> 00:52:12.143
Can I talk to him, please?

740
00:52:15.946 --> 00:52:17.282
- Dane.
- Yeah.


741
00:52:17.315 --> 00:52:20.485
- It's Don Challis here.
- Yeah, Don.


742
00:52:20.518 --> 00:52:23.221
- Where are you?
- Just around Jeffrey's Point.


743
00:52:23.254 --> 00:52:24.189
What do you see?

744
00:52:24.222 --> 00:52:27.692
A box, someone's been burnt alive.

745
00:52:27.725 --> 00:52:28.726
The body?

746
00:52:28.728 --> 00:52:31.730
I don't know, it's burnt
beyond recognition.


747
00:52:31.762 --> 00:52:33.498
Is there, um...

748
00:52:35.833 --> 00:52:39.437
- Is there any jewelery on her?
- I'll check.


749
00:52:40.971 --> 00:52:46.444
A silver bracelet and a
large ring with a gemstone.


750
00:52:48.479 --> 00:52:49.414
Still can't get Marty.

751
00:52:52.383 --> 00:52:53.451
Sweetheart, thank God.

752
00:52:53.484 --> 00:52:55.686
It's all my fault.

753
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.921
I shouldn't have.

754
00:52:56.954 --> 00:52:58.789
Sweetheart, it was not your fault, okay?

755
00:52:58.823 --> 00:53:00.525
It was not your fault.

756
00:53:00.558 --> 00:53:03.928
This sick bastard has taped
my inhaler inside my box,


757
00:53:03.961 --> 00:53:05.563
but I can't reach.

758
00:53:05.596 --> 00:53:06.931
Okay, well then slow your breathing.

759
00:53:06.964 --> 00:53:09.267
You've gotta slow down
and calm down, please.


760
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:10.701
Okay.

761
00:53:10.735 --> 00:53:15.373
Oh, no.
My cell's almost flat.


762
00:53:16.407 --> 00:53:19.444
Please do something,
Dad, I don't wanna die here.


763
00:53:19.477 --> 00:53:21.279
Sweetie, you are not going to die.

764
00:53:21.312 --> 00:53:23.548
I promise, you are not going to die.

765
00:53:23.581 --> 00:53:26.651
Now slow your breathing, good girl.

766
00:53:26.684 --> 00:53:28.453
Now this is what
I want you to do,

767
00:53:28.486 --> 00:53:30.821
I want you to hang up,
keep your phone on,


768
00:53:30.855 --> 00:53:32.357
and don't take any calls.

769
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:34.625
We need you to keep a signal.

770
00:53:34.659 --> 00:53:36.827
Now, I am going to find you

771
00:53:36.861 --> 00:53:38.763
and you're going to be okay.

772
00:53:39.997 --> 00:53:41.532
I love you, sweetie.

773
00:53:41.566 --> 00:53:43.501
I love you, too, Dad.

774
00:53:51.409 --> 00:53:52.810
Yes.

775
00:53:52.843 --> 00:53:55.413
Right, what do we do?

776
00:53:55.446 --> 00:53:57.415
I think we need Ms. Halms.

777
00:55:15.125 --> 00:55:17.762
I know you're clever,

778
00:55:17.795 --> 00:55:21.599
but are you clever
enough to save them all?


779
00:55:21.632 --> 00:55:23.534
Time's running out.

780
00:55:23.568 --> 00:55:27.505
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

781
00:55:34.044 --> 00:55:34.945
Sophie.

782
00:55:34.979 --> 00:55:37.715
Sergeant Hart,
it's past four in the morning.


783
00:55:37.748 --> 00:55:40.585
I'm sorry, but I need your help.

784
00:55:47.492 --> 00:55:48.659
Kimmy?

785
00:55:49.727 --> 00:55:51.996
I know, she is such a bitch.

786
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:53.864
She totally stubbed
me today at swimming.


787
00:55:53.898 --> 00:55:56.434
Oh, hang on.

788
00:55:57.568 --> 00:55:58.469
Hey, Jules.

789
00:55:58.503 --> 00:56:01.806
Oh, my God, I was just
talking about you.


790
00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:03.374
All good, of course.

791
00:56:03.408 --> 00:56:05.643
- Kimmy.
- What are you guys up to?


792
00:56:05.676 --> 00:56:07.745
Are you making
a short film or something?


793
00:56:07.778 --> 00:56:09.514
What the hell are you talking about?

794
00:56:09.547 --> 00:56:13.117
You're like, totally
all over Screen It Live.


795
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:14.619
What's going on?

796
00:56:28.633 --> 00:56:29.734
Marty?

797
00:56:29.767 --> 00:56:30.735
Brie.

798
00:56:30.768 --> 00:56:32.503
Thank God you're okay.

799
00:56:32.537 --> 00:56:34.171
There's lots of interference.

800
00:56:34.204 --> 00:56:40.611
A strong magnetic field, magnetic
field or electrical field.


801
00:56:40.645 --> 00:56:43.481
What, like, power interference?

802
00:56:43.514 --> 00:56:46.651
How did you go with--

803
00:56:46.684 --> 00:56:47.752
With what?

804
00:56:49.186 --> 00:56:53.491
- Hey, I followed your email.
- Hello?


805
00:56:54.692 --> 00:56:55.626
Look...

806
00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:57.628
Marty, I'm going to find you.

807
00:56:58.963 --> 00:57:00.731
Just sit tight.

808
00:57:00.765 --> 00:57:04.769
Power transfer, power transfer.

809
00:57:04.802 --> 00:57:07.137
Huh? Say again?

810
00:57:07.171 --> 00:57:08.806
Hello?

811
00:57:14.845 --> 00:57:16.781
- Marty?
- Brie, it's me.


812
00:57:16.814 --> 00:57:18.048
- Jules?
- It's all over the web.


813
00:57:18.082 --> 00:57:20.751
- You okay?
- The bastard's got us on Screen It.


814
00:57:20.785 --> 00:57:21.986
We're what?

815
00:57:22.019 --> 00:57:25.590
You've gotta run
Screen It, you might find us.


816
00:57:26.724 --> 00:57:28.726
You've gotta find us.

817
00:58:03.594 --> 00:58:05.630
The detectors are still
locked up in the tech store


818
00:58:05.663 --> 00:58:10.000
but they should work pretty
much straight out of the box.


819
00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:17.542
- I'll grab a laptop.
- Can I use the phone?


820
00:58:17.575 --> 00:58:20.778
Yep, just dial zero for a line out.

821
00:58:21.746 --> 00:58:22.947
Oak Bay Police Department,

822
00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:23.914
Nardine Walsh speaking.

823
00:58:23.948 --> 00:58:25.683
Nardine, it's Gary.

824
00:58:25.716 --> 00:58:28.218
We have a triple nine
at my current location.


825
00:58:28.252 --> 00:58:31.722
- Order a Code two QT.
- Where are you?


826
00:58:31.756 --> 00:58:33.691
Reverse search this number,
and be quick.


827
00:58:37.795 --> 00:58:39.229
Okay.

828
00:58:48.906 --> 00:58:51.542
We have to be careful,
but take a look at this.


829
00:58:53.243 --> 00:58:55.279
What's she doing?

830
00:58:58.983 --> 00:59:00.651
What the hell is this?

831
00:59:00.685 --> 00:59:03.988
- Oh, no, no.
- Shit.


832
00:59:06.156 --> 00:59:07.825
Tess, open Tess.

833
00:59:07.858 --> 00:59:09.794
She's still breathing but,

834
00:59:09.827 --> 00:59:12.162
I think we're running out of time.

835
00:59:17.001 --> 00:59:18.569
Anybody!

836
00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:21.806
Can anybody hear me?

837
00:59:22.673 --> 00:59:23.841
Help!

838
00:59:40.858 --> 00:59:43.728
There's one.
And two.


839
00:59:45.262 --> 00:59:48.132
Hang on, there's stuff missing.

840
00:59:54.404 --> 00:59:55.940
Just wait here.

841
01:00:02.312 --> 01:00:03.681
That you, Dane?

842
01:00:03.981 --> 01:00:05.182
Sarge?

843
01:00:10.087 --> 01:00:12.422
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, follow me.


844
01:00:16.293 --> 01:00:18.395
Dane, you know Sophie Halms?

845
01:00:18.428 --> 01:00:20.264
- I certainly do.
- Hi, Dane.


846
01:00:20.297 --> 01:00:21.632
You wouldn't believe what I just saw.

847
01:00:21.666 --> 01:00:23.701
Amy Challis, we know.

848
01:00:23.734 --> 01:00:25.402
Poor Ames, poor Don.

849
01:00:25.435 --> 01:00:27.371
Now, look, we got
five other kids in danger,


850
01:00:27.404 --> 01:00:28.706
and we don't have much time.

851
01:00:28.739 --> 01:00:30.708
- Hey, Dane.
- Brie.


852
01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:54.064
Brie, pick up. Pick up, Brie.

853
01:00:58.468 --> 01:01:00.805
Stu. What's going on?

854
01:01:00.838 --> 01:01:03.440
Brie, can you hear me?
I'm at the mill!


855
01:01:03.473 --> 01:01:05.309
I can't hear you.

856
01:01:11.448 --> 01:01:13.317
What's he doing?

857
01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:14.685
What's he texting or something?

858
01:01:14.719 --> 01:01:16.086
Nah, it can't be.

859
01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:18.856
"Mill."

860
01:01:18.889 --> 01:01:20.991
He's at the sawmill.

861
01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:22.459
Take one of these detectors
it'll help you track him down.


862
01:01:22.492 --> 01:01:25.262
- Yeah, yeah.
- Run like hell, mate, run.


863
01:01:34.004 --> 01:01:36.206
Brie, wake up Stu's dad.

864
01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:56.761
Come on, answer the phone!

865
01:02:13.077 --> 01:02:14.979
I don't want to die!

866
01:02:19.149 --> 01:02:22.019
Oh, God! Oh, Stu!

867
01:03:09.099 --> 01:03:11.035
Tell me where they are, Brie.

868
01:03:11.068 --> 01:03:13.070
I don't know.

869
01:03:13.103 --> 01:03:14.805
Well, guess.

870
01:03:16.874 --> 01:03:18.242
Where in the hell are they?

871
01:03:18.275 --> 01:03:20.077
I mean, can't we
pull the pin on this?

872
01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:21.245
No we need this site,

873
01:03:21.278 --> 01:03:23.580
I'm trying to track down the IP address.

874
01:03:23.613 --> 01:03:25.983
Brie, we have no idea
where Tess is, right?


875
01:03:26.016 --> 01:03:27.818
Yep.

876
01:03:27.852 --> 01:03:30.020
She's the one we know the least about.

877
01:03:31.355 --> 01:03:34.091
I've got Marty narrowed down to, like,

878
01:03:34.124 --> 01:03:37.327
half a dozen possible places.

879
01:03:37.361 --> 01:03:41.131
And with Jules, um,

880
01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:44.168
I know it's smelly and dark,

881
01:03:44.201 --> 01:03:48.438
there are roaches,
it could be a warehouse, or...


882
01:03:50.607 --> 01:03:52.076
And Kyle...

883
01:03:54.879 --> 01:03:57.514
I think Kyle's either in a tank

884
01:03:57.547 --> 01:04:01.218
or a sewer, some kind of fresh water.

885
01:04:02.286 --> 01:04:04.221
Narrows it down a bit, right?

886
01:04:04.254 --> 01:04:08.258
Okay, let's play the numbers.
Water treatment plant?


887
01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:10.594
- The reservoir?
- No, too remote.


888
01:04:10.627 --> 01:04:12.429
He only had
three hours to place 'em all.


889
01:04:12.462 --> 01:04:14.865
That's assuming
there's only one of them.


890
01:04:14.899 --> 01:04:15.665
Yeah.

891
01:04:15.699 --> 01:04:19.069
Think about it, Amy was burnt

892
01:04:19.103 --> 01:04:21.371
down by the old Jetty.

893
01:04:22.206 --> 01:04:24.074
She's the only smoker in our group

894
01:04:24.108 --> 01:04:26.043
and her dad's the fire chief.

895
01:04:26.076 --> 01:04:28.078
That can't be a coincidence.

896
01:04:28.112 --> 01:04:30.981
Stu was at his dad's mill.

897
01:04:31.015 --> 01:04:33.017
There's a connection with them all.

898
01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:34.218
What's the motive?

899
01:04:34.251 --> 01:04:37.121
Right now we don't have time for motive.

900
01:04:37.154 --> 01:04:39.589
Kyle's a swimmer, a swimmer.

901
01:04:39.623 --> 01:04:41.525
Okay, well, there are
three pools in town.


902
01:04:41.558 --> 01:04:43.027
The Olympic, the Riverside.

903
01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.594
And Oak Bay High.

904
01:04:44.628 --> 01:04:46.964
I'll be right back.
Get Dane down to the other two.


905
01:04:46.997 --> 01:04:49.433
- What about Stu?
- It's about the living.


906
01:04:59.243 --> 01:05:01.245
I've been watching this all night.

907
01:05:01.278 --> 01:05:02.546
Check this out.

908
01:05:08.418 --> 01:05:09.886
Kyle!

909
01:05:12.556 --> 01:05:14.558
Kyle, can you hear me?

910
01:06:08.278 --> 01:06:09.446
Macka.

911
01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:38.708
Jules.

912
01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:46.616
What the hell was that?

913
01:07:04.434 --> 01:07:06.203
What the...?

914
01:08:09.799 --> 01:08:10.867
Kyle?

915
01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.269
Help!

916
01:08:16.806 --> 01:08:19.443
She's in some kind
of dumpster somewhere.


917
01:08:19.476 --> 01:08:22.346
That explains the roaches and the smell,

918
01:08:22.379 --> 01:08:24.314
I don't know why I didn't
realize before, I'm such a--


919
01:08:24.348 --> 01:08:27.351
The bindings on my legs,
they are electrodes.


920
01:08:27.384 --> 01:08:30.187
That would explain the interference.

921
01:08:33.857 --> 01:08:35.559
Marty, hang on.

922
01:08:35.592 --> 01:08:38.428
- Chief.
- What have you got?


923
01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:39.663
I know where Marty is.

924
01:08:39.696 --> 01:08:41.331
You'd better hurry.

925
01:08:41.365 --> 01:08:44.268
Screen It's saying Kyle's gone.

926
01:08:44.301 --> 01:08:45.335
Is Ms. Halms all right?

927
01:08:45.369 --> 01:08:47.404
Okay, let's get out of here.

928
01:08:54.678 --> 01:08:56.146
Kyle.

929
01:09:52.001 --> 01:09:53.503
You're okay now, Sophie.

930
01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:55.405
In you hop, sweetheart.

931
01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.509
- Go, go, go.
- Okay. Look after her, fellas.


932
01:10:02.979 --> 01:10:05.749
Weird, buddy, weird.

933
01:10:39.449 --> 01:10:42.252
Jules, I know where you are,
we're on our way.


934
01:10:42.286 --> 01:10:43.687
Brie, please hurry.

935
01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:44.888
Jules?

936
01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:06.310
Dane, I think it's Macka.

937
01:11:06.343 --> 01:11:09.012
He's using his phone as
some sort of trigger device.


938
01:11:09.045 --> 01:11:10.780
So treat it as a weapon.

939
01:11:10.814 --> 01:11:13.049
- Copy that, sarge.
- Be careful, okay?


940
01:11:13.082 --> 01:11:14.584
Yeah, don't worry.

941
01:11:18.522 --> 01:11:21.691
Nardine, Brie's found Jules at
Springs Mall, she's heading there now.


942
01:11:21.725 --> 01:11:24.060
Oh, great, do I
still have to be careful?


943
01:11:24.093 --> 01:11:25.529
No, it's too late for that now,

944
01:11:25.562 --> 01:11:26.663
whoever did this knows we know.

945
01:11:26.696 --> 01:11:30.467
- Yeah, but--
- I said it's too late, all right?


946
01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.602
Ah, Jesus!

947
01:11:33.603 --> 01:11:34.671
Marty?

948
01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:38.908
Hey, hey, yeah.

949
01:11:40.377 --> 01:11:42.979
Marty Pollock,
it's Gary Hart, can you hear me?


950
01:11:45.582 --> 01:11:46.916
Sarge!

951
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:48.518
I can hear you.

952
01:11:49.986 --> 01:11:51.555
I just have to find a way in.

953
01:11:53.089 --> 01:11:56.660
Off peak power switches over at six!

954
01:11:56.693 --> 01:11:57.561
Sarge!

955
01:11:57.594 --> 01:11:58.962
God.

956
01:12:10.574 --> 01:12:12.876
I'm here, Marty, I'm here.

957
01:12:15.879 --> 01:12:17.547
You okay?

958
01:12:17.581 --> 01:12:21.485
Sure I am, get me out
of this fucking box.


959
01:12:40.036 --> 01:12:43.607
Please, please,
I'm in here, stop! Please!


960
01:12:50.179 --> 01:12:51.981
Please, I'm in here!

961
01:12:53.817 --> 01:12:55.685
I'm in here! Please!

962
01:13:01.625 --> 01:13:03.627
Stop, stop!

963
01:13:05.995 --> 01:13:07.831
Shut it down!

964
01:13:07.864 --> 01:13:10.066
Shut it down, there's someone in there!

965
01:13:10.099 --> 01:13:11.468
Help!

966
01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:22.546
Jules, hang on!

967
01:13:28.485 --> 01:13:31.855
Oh, God, call an ambulance!

968
01:13:32.589 --> 01:13:33.990
Oh, Jules...

969
01:13:34.558 --> 01:13:35.659
Do it!

970
01:13:36.493 --> 01:13:38.628
It's okay, I'm coming.

971
01:13:38.662 --> 01:13:39.796
Jules!

972
01:13:54.143 --> 01:13:56.746
You're all right, pal, you're okay.

973
01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.815
I'll see you soon.

974
01:14:00.216 --> 01:14:01.485
Charging.

975
01:14:02.686 --> 01:14:03.720
Stay clear.

976
01:14:07.824 --> 01:14:10.494
Got a pulse.

977
01:14:10.527 --> 01:14:12.195
Don, it's Gary Hart here, mate.

978
01:14:12.228 --> 01:14:12.989
Hello, Gary.

979
01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:15.232
Look, I'm way under-maned
and I need your help.


980
01:14:15.264 --> 01:14:16.700
Sure.

981
01:14:16.733 --> 01:14:19.503
I've got on APB out on Rodney MacNamara,

982
01:14:19.536 --> 01:14:21.671
Macka from the school.

983
01:14:21.705 --> 01:14:24.574
I need you to check his
place out for me please.


984
01:14:24.608 --> 01:14:25.775
No worries.

985
01:14:45.128 --> 01:14:48.665
- Brie.
- She's at the cemetery.


986
01:14:48.698 --> 01:14:50.266
All the lines, they make a pentagram,

987
01:14:50.299 --> 01:14:52.736
I've worked out the exact
center, she's at the cemetery.


988
01:14:52.769 --> 01:14:53.812
Are you sure?

989
01:14:53.814 --> 01:14:56.941
Yeah, it all makes sense,
none of this is random.


990
01:14:56.973 --> 01:15:00.009
The golden ratio, smart thinking.

991
01:15:00.043 --> 01:15:03.647
I saw Macka before, in the school van.

992
01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.949
He's not smart enough to do all this.

993
01:15:05.982 --> 01:15:10.219
Yeah, maybe not alone,
but he's our only suspect.


994
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:27.804
- Marty.
- Yeah?


995
01:15:27.837 --> 01:15:29.105
You go back and wait for Brie okay?

996
01:15:29.138 --> 01:15:31.841
- Yeah.
- Gary, he's not there.


997
01:15:31.875 --> 01:15:33.009
Matthew's not there.

998
01:15:33.042 --> 01:15:34.744
Dane, you keep an eye out for him.

999
01:15:34.778 --> 01:15:38.114
Follow me I know exactly where she is.

1000
01:15:47.824 --> 01:15:48.958
This has been moved,
give me a hand, Don.


1001
01:15:48.992 --> 01:15:50.760
- What?
- Give me a hand.


1002
01:15:50.794 --> 01:15:52.862
Push, mate, push.

1003
01:16:06.075 --> 01:16:08.745
- Let me go!
- Tell them it wasn't me, Brie.


1004
01:16:10.146 --> 01:16:12.281
You really think I'm smart
enough to pull this shit off?


1005
01:16:12.315 --> 01:16:13.683
Do you?

1006
01:16:14.217 --> 01:16:15.284
Marty!

1007
01:16:15.318 --> 01:16:16.319
Brie!

1008
01:16:16.352 --> 01:16:17.987
Brie, oh, no.

1009
01:16:19.122 --> 01:16:20.556
Push!

1010
01:16:21.891 --> 01:16:23.326
Push!

1011
01:16:23.359 --> 01:16:24.594
Tess...!

1012
01:16:24.628 --> 01:16:26.896
Tess, sweetheart.

1013
01:16:28.064 --> 01:16:29.999
Give me a hand
here, give me a hand.

1014
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:32.736
Lift it up, lift!

1015
01:16:33.937 --> 01:16:36.873
Teabird, Teabird, 
Teabird it's okay.

1016
01:16:36.906 --> 01:16:38.908
I saw it on Screen It.

1017
01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:40.644
Macka, put your weapon down.

1018
01:16:41.645 --> 01:16:42.846
Come on, put it down, Macka.

1019
01:16:42.879 --> 01:16:44.848
It'll explain everything, shut up.

1020
01:16:44.881 --> 01:16:47.751
- It's okay.
- Macka put the phone down!


1021
01:16:47.784 --> 01:16:49.318
- Don't!
- You'll get a chance.


1022
01:16:49.352 --> 01:16:51.888
- Don't shoot!
- No, you have to tell them now!


1023
01:16:52.856 --> 01:16:54.023
Jesus.

1024
01:16:54.057 --> 01:16:55.591
Brie?

1025
01:17:08.304 --> 01:17:10.206
Oh, shit.

1026
01:17:15.278 --> 01:17:16.680
- My baby...
- Oh, Jesus.


1027
01:17:16.713 --> 01:17:19.916
My beautiful baby.

1028
01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.022
My baby girl.

1029
01:18:07.196 --> 01:18:10.900
* I can't say goodbye

1030
01:18:10.934 --> 01:18:14.037
* 'Cause no matter
how hard I try *

1031
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:20.676
* I can't comprehend that
you're not all still here *


1032
01:18:23.046 --> 01:18:26.716
* I can't let you go

1033
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:30.153
* 'Cause deep inside I know

1034
01:18:30.186 --> 01:18:34.824
* That there's nothing I can do *

1035
01:18:35.424 --> 01:18:39.028
* You're all just gone

1036
01:18:40.196 --> 01:18:43.432
* You're gone

1037
01:18:43.466 --> 01:18:47.103
* You're all gone

1038
01:18:54.778 --> 01:18:58.347
* Why did you have to feel?

1039
01:18:58.381 --> 01:19:01.985
* And why did I have to see?

1040
01:19:02.018 --> 01:19:06.890
* This should never have happened *

1041
01:19:06.923 --> 01:19:10.026
* Why couldn't
it have been me? *


1042
01:19:10.059 --> 01:19:14.363
* And it won't be okay

1043
01:19:14.397 --> 01:19:17.767
* I'll see you
everyday but I know *

1044
01:19:17.801 --> 01:19:22.471
* That somehow I've
gotta find a way *

1045
01:19:22.505 --> 01:19:26.042
* To let it go for you

1046
01:19:26.075 --> 01:19:29.345
* To forgive the circumstance

1047
01:19:29.378 --> 01:19:33.950
* To give heaven half a chance *

1048
01:19:33.983 --> 01:19:40.523
* To let them carry you
freely off into the distance *


1049
01:19:40.556 --> 01:19:45.061
* Maybe this was just your time *

1050
01:19:45.094 --> 01:19:47.430
Hey, Jules, how are you?

1051
01:19:47.463 --> 01:19:48.965
I'm all right.

1052
01:19:48.998 --> 01:19:50.133
How's Kyle?

1053
01:19:50.166 --> 01:19:52.068
Still no change.

1054
01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:55.538
He's strong, Jules, he'll pull through.

1055
01:19:55.571 --> 01:19:59.342
Brie, what if they stare?

1056
01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:01.510
It'll be all right.

1057
01:20:01.544 --> 01:20:03.579
You're the queen of Oak Bay.

1058
01:20:03.612 --> 01:20:07.383
Yeah, on my permanent throne.

1059
01:20:12.155 --> 01:20:13.256
Morning, Mr. Freeman.

1060
01:20:13.289 --> 01:20:14.390
Hi, Brie.

1061
01:20:14.423 --> 01:20:16.225
Nice chair.

1062
01:20:16.259 --> 01:20:19.996
The hospital one was so chunky.

1063
01:20:20.029 --> 01:20:22.899
- Have a good day.
- See you after rehab.


1064
01:20:22.932 --> 01:20:25.468
- So, surfing the web last night.
- Yeah?


1065
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:28.137
Apparently, some guys have
a real fetish for amputees.


1066
01:20:29.205 --> 01:20:30.907
A bit of stumpy-rumpy-pumpy?

1067
01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.041
Gross.

1068
01:20:32.075 --> 01:20:35.144
So, I saw your
story on TV last night.

1069
01:20:35.178 --> 01:20:38.081
They've been pestering me for weeks.

1070
01:20:38.114 --> 01:20:40.850
Hey, Tina.
Hey, Chantelle.


1071
01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:43.953
Jules Freeman?

1072
01:20:43.987 --> 01:20:45.955
- Have you got a moment?
- Oh, God.


1073
01:20:45.989 --> 01:20:49.158
Jules, I'll get
rid of them, don't worry.


1074
01:21:01.637 --> 01:21:04.540
Oh, sorry, are you all right?

1075
01:21:04.573 --> 01:21:06.009
I'm fine.

1076
01:21:07.977 --> 01:21:09.345
Are you okay?

1077
01:21:12.315 --> 01:21:14.017
Yeah, I'm fine.

1078
01:21:14.918 --> 01:21:16.986
Better than your brother.

1079
01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:22.358
Well, what can I say,
he was always a bit messed up.


1080
01:21:22.391 --> 01:21:27.430
You just never really knew
when he was gonna snap.


1081
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.136
But I guess it's good he's gone.

1082
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:36.105
You know, so he doesn't try and...

1083
01:21:37.106 --> 01:21:39.275
...take the other leg.

1084
01:21:42.178 --> 01:21:46.182
You can only hope that
this isn't hereditary.


1085
01:22:07.003 --> 01:22:11.574
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

1086
01:22:30.226 --> 01:22:34.263
* I'm being followed by my shadow *

1087
01:22:34.297 --> 01:22:37.400
* He's been creeping around

1088
01:22:37.433 --> 01:22:41.137
* Asking where I've been

1089
01:22:42.238 --> 01:22:46.309
* He keeps tapping on my shoulder *

1090
01:22:46.342 --> 01:22:49.312
* Telling me it's over

1091
01:22:49.345 --> 01:22:53.049
* So where do I begin?

1092
01:23:06.562 --> 01:23:10.599
* These dark days are getting harder *

1093
01:23:10.633 --> 01:23:13.702
* I feel I'm treading water

1094
01:23:13.736 --> 01:23:17.473
* So will I sink or swim?

1095
01:23:18.541 --> 01:23:22.478
* Roll on, push a little further *

1096
01:23:22.511 --> 01:23:25.781
* I keep saying
is this worth it *

1097
01:23:25.814 --> 01:23:29.152
* Or should I just give in?

1098
01:23:29.185 --> 01:23:32.088
* I don't know

1099
01:23:36.325 --> 01:23:43.732
* I don't know which
way I'm supposed to spin *


1100
01:23:45.168 --> 01:23:48.404
* In this circle

1101
01:23:48.437 --> 01:23:55.678
* And I won't waste my
time on your concern *


1102
01:23:57.346 --> 01:24:00.316
* 'Til it's over

1103
01:24:25.341 --> 01:24:29.612
* I look back
on a distant border *

1104
01:24:29.645 --> 01:24:32.515
* I fear I'm getting older

1105
01:24:32.548 --> 01:24:37.386
* There's so much that I missed *

1106
01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:42.258
* Walk on following a fate line *

1107
01:24:42.291 --> 01:24:45.228
* See if I can define

1108
01:24:45.261 --> 01:24:48.297
* Where I came undone

1109
01:24:49.465 --> 01:24:56.839
* I don't know which
way I'm supposed to spin *


1110
01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.477
* In this circle

1111
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:08.784
* And I won't waste my
time on your concern *


1112
01:25:10.253 --> 01:25:13.589
* 'Til it's over

1113
01:25:13.622 --> 01:25:17.593
* And I will wait my turn

1114
01:25:17.626 --> 01:25:22.265
* My time will come

1115
01:25:22.298 --> 01:25:25.668
* This ain't over

1116
01:25:25.701 --> 01:25:29.705
* And I can't wait no more

1117
01:25:29.738 --> 01:25:34.410
* No sweet return

1118
01:25:34.443 --> 01:25:37.480
* This is over

1119
01:25:37.513 --> 01:25:39.548
* So it is

1120
01:25:39.582 --> 01:25:43.586
* No sweet return

1121
01:25:43.619 --> 01:25:45.288
* So it is

1122
01:25:45.321 --> 01:25:49.492
* No sweet return

1123
01:25:49.525 --> 01:25:51.360
* So it is

1124
01:25:51.394 --> 01:25:55.831
* No sweet return
