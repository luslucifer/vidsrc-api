1
00:00:43.327 --> 00:00:45.690
So the little girl started
to undress.


2
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.689
She got into her granny`s bed.

3
00:00:49.393 --> 00:00:53.654
The little girl was puzzled,
because her granny was acting funny.


4
00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:55.184
Then she said:

5
00:00:55.358 --> 00:00:59.914
``Oh, Grandma,
what big eyes you`ve got!``


6
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.283
And the granny said,
``All the better to see you with.``


7
00:01:04.757 --> 00:01:07.847
``Oh, Grandma,
what a long nose you`ve got!``


8
00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.948
``All the better to smell you with!``

9
00:01:11.288 --> 00:01:15.720
Then she said, ``Oh, Grandma,
what long teeth you`ve got!``


10
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.812
``So much the better
to gobble you up with!``


11
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.218
And she gobbled her up!

12
00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:24.349
-Did you like that story?
-No.


13
00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:26.241
Why not?

14
00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.907
lt`s sad.

15
00:01:30.652 --> 00:01:33.117
What story would you like now?

16
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:35.739
Blue Beard.

17
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.275
Blue Beard?

18
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.541
Let`s see.
Once upon a time....


19
00:02:54.836 --> 00:02:56.392
Antoine!

20
00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:02.965
Pull up the top, please.

21
00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:15.659
To the golf course.

22
00:03:17.798 --> 00:03:20.763
No, to the go-carts.

23
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.388
No, the harbor.

24
00:03:29.062 --> 00:03:30.789
No, to the golf course.

25
00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:35.660
On second thought,
let`s go to the go-carts.


26
00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:47.250
You hurt me.

27
00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:50.050
Did l? l`m sorry if l did!

28
00:03:50.925 --> 00:03:53.516
-When l took your hand off the wheel?
-Yes.


29
00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:54.849
l`m sorry.

30
00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:56.274
You`ve lost weight.

31
00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:57.434
Why`s that?

32
00:04:57.613 --> 00:04:58.601
l don`t know.

33
00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.006
Don`t you eat at school?
Don`t you like the food?


34
00:05:11.576 --> 00:05:13.508
Do you want some chocolate?

35
00:05:14.242 --> 00:05:15.401
No, l want a cake.

36
00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:16.700
A cake?

37
00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.906
l don`t know if we`ll find
a bakery around here.


38
00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:23.406
What sort of cake do you want?

39
00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:31.130
Look what l`ve done now!
lt`s funny, isn`t it?


40
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.727
These boots are nice.

41
00:05:47.103 --> 00:05:50.262
-You want a pair like these?
-No, l want a cake.


42
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:51.560
You want a cake.

43
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:13.577
Hurry! Otherwise, l`ll miss my train!
See you Sunday, darling.


44
00:07:13.787 --> 00:07:16.309
Don`t get cold.
Hurry, go inside, quick!


45
00:07:18.652 --> 00:07:23.584
Go on! Bye. See you Sunday.

46
00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:44.304
Come on, children!

47
00:07:54.446 --> 00:07:58.639
We`re in the middle of December,
and you drive with the top down.


48
00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:00.402
lt`s not me. lt`s Antoine.

49
00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:04.441
Blame Antoine!
Come and have supper, darling.


50
00:08:04.644 --> 00:08:06.132
There you are!

51
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:08.469
Yes, darling. Come on.

52
00:08:08.643 --> 00:08:10.108
Come on, Antoine.

53
00:08:11.076 --> 00:08:16.007
l promise you that if you`re good all
week, next Sunday we`ll go boating.


54
00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:18.106
No, tomorrow! Tomorrow!

55
00:08:18.275 --> 00:08:20.433
Tomorrow, you work. Next Sunday!

56
00:08:20.675 --> 00:08:22.140
Go and have supper.

57
00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:25.937
There, now.
You spoil him, you know.


58
00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:27.696
lt`s only once a week.

59
00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:30.737
But he doesn`t work very hard.
He`s lazy.


60
00:08:30.906 --> 00:08:33.064
lntelligent, but lazy.

61
00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:34.465
He takes after me.

62
00:08:34.638 --> 00:08:36.604
What are you going to do about it?

63
00:08:36.938 --> 00:08:39.961
Antoine`s been in your care
for two years. You`ve done wonders.


64
00:08:40.138 --> 00:08:42.796
l`m certain you`ll be able to do
even better.


65
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.799
ln two years,
we haven`t talked seriously.


66
00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:49.061
l cannot talk seriously
to a pretty woman.


67
00:08:50.435 --> 00:08:52.799
Be careful.
lt`s foggy this evening.


68
00:08:54.302 --> 00:08:56.563
-Maybe the roads are icy.
-lce?


69
00:08:57.067 --> 00:08:58.226
There you are!

70
00:09:51.357 --> 00:09:52.845
Do you often miss trains?

71
00:09:54.757 --> 00:09:55.848
Yes.

72
00:09:56.023 --> 00:09:57.886
l`m not very punctual.

73
00:10:00.289 --> 00:10:02.414
Do you always manage to get a lift?

74
00:10:03.155 --> 00:10:04.143
No.

75
00:10:04.322 --> 00:10:05.514
l sleep in Deauville.

76
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.310
She doesn`t work too well.

77
00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:17.010
l see. She`s intelligent, but lazy.

78
00:10:17.586 --> 00:10:18.744
Who told you that?

79
00:10:23.918 --> 00:10:25.111
What`s her name?

80
00:10:26.051 --> 00:10:27.108
FranÃ§oise.

81
00:10:29.651 --> 00:10:30.638
Him?

82
00:10:30.816 --> 00:10:31.804
Antoine.

83
00:10:32.216 --> 00:10:33.204
Antoine.

84
00:10:34.049 --> 00:10:35.242
That`s nice.

85
00:10:39.615 --> 00:10:41.637
Do you go regularly to the school?

86
00:10:41.948 --> 00:10:45.709
Well, l come every weekend
when l`m not working.


87
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.968
You?

88
00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:49.143
l come every Saturday.

89
00:10:49.413 --> 00:10:51.504
And Sunday too, sometimes.

90
00:11:08.476 --> 00:11:09.567
May l?

91
00:11:11.209 --> 00:11:12.573
Why, sure.

92
00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:05.297
You mustn`t laugh.

93
00:12:05.965 --> 00:12:07.897
lt was enough to make
you cry in 1 91 4.

94
00:12:27.195 --> 00:12:28.286
Are you married?

95
00:12:32.894 --> 00:12:33.951
You?

96
00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:39.854
You don`t look married.

97
00:12:42.058 --> 00:12:44.546
What does a married man look like?

98
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.121
What`s your husband`s line?

99
00:13:21.684 --> 00:13:23.479
Do you mean he`s an actor?

100
00:13:24.317 --> 00:13:26.078
Well, not quite.

101
00:13:27.017 --> 00:13:28.744
He`s more than an actor.

102
00:13:46.213 --> 00:13:47.872
Funny job that, stuntman.

103
00:13:49.946 --> 00:13:52.343
How does one meet a stuntman?

104
00:13:55.445 --> 00:13:56.502
ln a gully?

105
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.671
ln Texas?

106
00:14:04.576 --> 00:14:05.769
On a burning plane?

107
00:14:08.775 --> 00:14:09.763
Am l close?

108
00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:11.463
No.

109
00:14:13.141 --> 00:14:14.266
l give up.

110
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:53.630
Your story is like a soap opera.

111
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.697
Except for the stuntman,
it`s not original.


112
00:14:57.234 --> 00:14:59.324
l don`t claim to be original.

113
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.165
You meet someone, marry, have a baby.

114
00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:04.227
lt happens all the time.

115
00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:07.589
What can be original
is the man you love.


116
00:15:09.065 --> 00:15:10.996
Your husband must be original.

117
00:15:11.164 --> 00:15:12.527
For me, he is.

118
00:15:14.064 --> 00:15:20.053
He`s so fascinating, so exclusive!
A man of great integrity.


119
00:15:21.729 --> 00:15:23.455
He`s passionate about things...

120
00:15:23.761 --> 00:15:26.920
...about people, ideas.
About countries....


121
00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:29.416
He sounds like God.

122
00:15:30.627 --> 00:15:31.820
For me, maybe.

123
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.982
For instance, l spent a week in Brazil
without ever having been there.


124
00:15:38.292 --> 00:15:40.087
Pierre was in a film there.

125
00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:45.018
When he got back,
he talked about samba for a week.


126
00:15:45.624 --> 00:15:47.487
Samba came into our lives.

127
00:15:47.957 --> 00:15:50.048
Samba came into your life!

128
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:51.377
Yes.

129
00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:03.838
Where to, in Paris?

130
00:20:04.942 --> 00:20:05.930
Rue Lamarck.

131
00:20:06.242 --> 00:20:08.832
Rue Lamarck? Where`s that?

132
00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:10.904
lt`s in Montmartre.

133
00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:21.861
-ls this it?
-Yes.


134
00:20:22.106 --> 00:20:23.628
l didn`t know this street.

135
00:20:23.806 --> 00:20:24.794
No?

136
00:20:25.272 --> 00:20:27.737
A painter lived here
during World War l.


137
00:20:27.905 --> 00:20:33.427
ln 1 91 7, he engaged a Russian servant
whose name was Vladimir Ulyanov.


138
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.965
One year later, he was Lenin.

139
00:20:38.302 --> 00:20:42.325
Thank you very much
for giving me a lift.


140
00:20:42.501 --> 00:20:44.161
No, please, l can manage.

141
00:20:44.668 --> 00:20:46.099
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.


142
00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:53.288
By the way,
l`m driving to Deauville next Sunday.


143
00:20:54.399 --> 00:20:56.126
Would you like to come?

144
00:20:56.533 --> 00:20:58.964
l`d love to meet your husband.

145
00:21:16.695 --> 00:21:19.354
Cut! Okay, let`s do it again.

146
00:21:20.228 --> 00:21:22.318
Pierre! Come here a minute.

147
00:21:23.194 --> 00:21:26.251
Not bad. But next time,
don`t take so many risks.


148
00:21:54.321 --> 00:21:55.309
Go!

149
00:22:06.819 --> 00:22:08.012
l`m sorry.

150
00:22:09.218 --> 00:22:12.412
The way you talked about him,
l didn`t know he was dead.


151
00:22:14.484 --> 00:22:19.609
About Sunday, that`s most kind,
but l`m not sure l`ll be free.


152
00:22:20.784 --> 00:22:23.341
Call me Saturday midday
and l`ll tell you.


153
00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:25.547
l don`t have your number.

154
00:22:26.215 --> 00:22:27.613
Montmartre 1 5-40.

155
00:22:29.282 --> 00:22:30.907
-Good night.
-Good night.


156
00:22:51.544 --> 00:22:53.100
Montmartre 1 5-40.

157
00:27:31.292 --> 00:27:35.087
--he`d be holding a press conference
in the near future...


158
00:27:35.524 --> 00:27:37.456
...about the salary increases.

159
00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:42.112
And now for the sporting events.
There`s motor-racing on the agenda...


160
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.449
...with the forthcoming
Monte Carlo Rally.


161
00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:48.849
In one week, the 35th Rally will
be on its way.


162
00:27:49.022 --> 00:27:50.715
Cars are being tuned...

163
00:27:50.922 --> 00:27:56.478
...manufacturers are leaving nothing
to chance in the rugged competition.


164
00:27:56.654 --> 00:28:02.017
Among the favorites, the Toivonen team
driving a Cooper and a DS2 1....


165
00:28:11.184 --> 00:28:12.514
We know that this week...

166
00:28:12.684 --> 00:28:17.240
...they`ve been training to the hilt,
getting the maximum from their cars.


167
00:28:54.476 --> 00:28:55.635
Any good?

168
00:28:57.176 --> 00:28:58.199
One seventeen.

169
00:29:08.673 --> 00:29:09.934
Forty-three, four.

170
00:29:10.139 --> 00:29:11.127
Not bad.

171
00:29:11.606 --> 00:29:12.901
How many revs?

172
00:29:14.073 --> 00:29:15.061
Eleven thousand.

173
00:29:29.803 --> 00:29:32.200
Forty-three, seven.

174
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:38.132
How many revs now?

175
00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:40.562
We`ve won with 200 revs.
lt`s perfect.


176
00:31:01.485 --> 00:31:03.916
Operator, put me through
to Montmartre 1 5-40.


177
00:31:06.152 --> 00:31:11.049
No, no, could you put me through
in five minutes, please?


178
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.538
Thanks.

179
00:31:42.045 --> 00:31:43.533
Hello, Montmartre 1 5-40?

180
00:31:44.311 --> 00:31:45.777
This is Jean
-Louis Duroc.

181
00:31:48.277 --> 00:31:53.038
l gave you a lift from Paris,
from Deauville to Paris, last Sunday.


182
00:31:54.442 --> 00:31:57.203
Yes. How are you?

183
00:32:01.641 --> 00:32:06.732
l`m planning on driving to see my son
at school in Deauville tomorrow.


184
00:32:07.873 --> 00:32:11.134
l thought you`d like to drive
down there with me.


185
00:32:12.172 --> 00:32:13.331
Whenever you like.

186
00:32:14.306 --> 00:32:16.669
Around 9, 9:30, whatever.

187
00:32:17.338 --> 00:32:18.326
What?

188
00:32:18.837 --> 00:32:20.962
Nine o`clock. Nine it is, then.

189
00:33:05.229 --> 00:33:06.819
Hello, there.

190
00:33:07.462 --> 00:33:08.825
l`m late.

191
00:33:08.995 --> 00:33:11.290
Not at all. Could`ve been worse.

192
00:33:34.823 --> 00:33:38.550
As you might have guessed,
that melody is called ''Love. ''


193
00:33:38.989 --> 00:33:41.352
Performed by Daniel Walt`s orchestra.

194
00:33:41.555 --> 00:33:45.418
On this Sunday morning,
we`d better talk about the weather.


195
00:33:45.788 --> 00:33:47.912
We`re in for a bad spell.

196
00:33:48.288 --> 00:33:53.878
I can tell you right away that
the weather forecast is rainy.


197
00:33:54.719 --> 00:33:56.878
There`ll be rain all over France.

198
00:33:57.619 --> 00:34:03.608
And roads are flooded, particularly
in the south and central highlands.


199
00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:09.607
As for the Parisians who may be
getting the picnic basket ready...


200
00:34:09.784 --> 00:34:11.840
...for a ride in the country...

201
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:16.445
...they may as well stay home, go to
the movies, or have a game of cards.


202
00:34:16.682 --> 00:34:22.636
Or listen to the radio.
I`ll be on the air all day Sunday...


203
00:34:23.248 --> 00:34:26.906
...probably talking a lot of
uninteresting nonsense.


204
00:34:27.147 --> 00:34:31.169
So it`s going to be a rainy Sunday,
with wet roads everywhere.


205
00:34:31.346 --> 00:34:33.504
A flash from the news...

206
00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:36.509
...that illustrates the weather
has just come in.


207
00:34:37.178 --> 00:34:40.632
A man and a woman were killed
earlier today...


208
00:34:41.211 --> 00:34:44.665
...when their sports car
skidded off the road.


209
00:34:44.844 --> 00:34:46.241
l hate hearing that.

210
00:34:47.477 --> 00:34:49.204
Especially when driving.

211
00:34:51.676 --> 00:34:52.834
Do l drive badly?

212
00:34:55.075 --> 00:34:57.835
No. You drive normally.

213
00:34:58.008 --> 00:35:01.872
Now, let`s change our mood
and listen to some light music.


214
00:35:02.307 --> 00:35:05.239
Here`s one you all know.

215
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.930
You haven`t told me what you do.

216
00:35:09.439 --> 00:35:14.336
l`ve got a job that`s....
That`s very unusual.


217
00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:16.493
Very original.

218
00:35:17.671 --> 00:35:19.466
Which makes loads of money.

219
00:36:10.628 --> 00:36:13.559
Shame on you!
And apart from that?


220
00:36:15.393 --> 00:36:16.983
l`ve got a good front.

221
00:36:18.293 --> 00:36:21.622
l`m in the motor business.
l`m a test driver.


222
00:36:22.525 --> 00:36:23.582
A racing driver?

223
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.583
l think you soaked those people.

224
00:36:38.122 --> 00:36:39.145
They`re hunters.

225
00:36:39.456 --> 00:36:40.944
No mercy on hunters!

226
00:36:45.854 --> 00:36:47.752
She started to cough on Friday.

227
00:36:47.921 --> 00:36:49.943
Nothing serious, but keep her warm.

228
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.712
There! There you are.

229
00:36:53.219 --> 00:36:55.684
You`re not cold, darling. You`re okay.

230
00:36:56.453 --> 00:36:57.440
Bye.

231
00:36:58.119 --> 00:36:59.744
-l`m not surprised.
-What?


232
00:36:59.985 --> 00:37:01.042
l`m not surprised.

233
00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:05.076
l didn`t see you on the 9:00 train.

234
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.509
Well, thank you. Goodbye.

235
00:37:09.017 --> 00:37:10.004
Come on.

236
00:37:11.949 --> 00:37:13.710
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.


237
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:15.337
Bye, madame.

238
00:37:19.381 --> 00:37:20.472
Are you happy?

239
00:37:23.914 --> 00:37:26.471
Tell me some more about your job.

240
00:37:27.313 --> 00:37:29.972
-My job?
-Not about yours.


241
00:37:31.945 --> 00:37:33.411
Antoine, talk about my job.

242
00:37:33.878 --> 00:37:35.901
-What?
-Don`t you want to?


243
00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:39.938
No, but l`ll tell you all about
my job.


244
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:41.235
Go on, then.

245
00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.467
The job l`ll have when l`m big....

246
00:37:43.643 --> 00:37:45.905
-Tell us.
-l want to be a fireman.


247
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:50.207
There`ll be 36 firemen with me.

248
00:37:50.375 --> 00:37:51.363
Thirty-six?

249
00:37:51.542 --> 00:37:53.871
But with me, it will make 37.

250
00:37:54.175 --> 00:37:56.732
-You`ll be the chief.
-Yes.


251
00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:03.938
You know what? We`ll have two big
fire engines with big ladders.


252
00:38:04.473 --> 00:38:05.665
Very big.

253
00:38:09.672 --> 00:38:13.364
The two fire engines will be huge
for the big fires.


254
00:38:13.638 --> 00:38:16.069
What will you do about small fires?

255
00:38:16.604 --> 00:38:18.070
What about small fires?

256
00:38:18.837 --> 00:38:21.428
We won`t need the ladder.

257
00:38:22.237 --> 00:38:26.691
That`s all.
And we won`t use much water.


258
00:38:27.802 --> 00:38:31.199
lf it`s locked,
we`ll take the axes and....


259
00:38:31.602 --> 00:38:35.192
Well, we`ll use them to hit
and that`s it.


260
00:38:35.367 --> 00:38:37.992
And then we use a little water.
That`s it.


261
00:38:41.399 --> 00:38:43.058
Tell me about your job.

262
00:38:43.565 --> 00:38:49.191
My work is largely technical. lt bores
women to talk about technicalities.


263
00:38:49.464 --> 00:38:51.760
But l can tell you some trivia.

264
00:38:51.997 --> 00:38:54.360
lt wouldn`t bore me.

265
00:38:55.763 --> 00:38:57.728
Take superstition, for example.

266
00:38:57.896 --> 00:39:01.521
We racing drivers are superstitious.
No car has number 1 3.


267
00:39:01.796 --> 00:39:02.783
Really?

268
00:39:03.162 --> 00:39:04.185
No car ever....

269
00:39:04.362 --> 00:39:06.327
No car ever bears number 1 3.

270
00:39:07.194 --> 00:39:10.489
Another number is 1 7,
many accidents for that one.


271
00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.191
ln ltaly, for example,
there`s never 1 7.


272
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.557
The ltalians are very superstitious.

273
00:39:17.459 --> 00:39:19.754
Have you ever heard of Ascari?

274
00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:22.449
-l think so.
-Yes?


275
00:39:23.024 --> 00:39:25.615
He was a driver, one of the best.

276
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:27.388
He died a few years ago.

277
00:39:27.591 --> 00:39:28.682
Yes, l see now.

278
00:39:28.856 --> 00:39:34.618
lf Ascari saw a black cat on the track
or on the side of the track...


279
00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:35.846
...he`d stop.

280
00:39:37.522 --> 00:39:39.784
Antoine, your napkin.

281
00:39:39.988 --> 00:39:42.250
Maybe they should eat, they`re hungry.

282
00:39:43.254 --> 00:39:44.242
Here.

283
00:39:44.421 --> 00:39:45.852
l don`t like shrimps.

284
00:39:46.521 --> 00:39:48.213
-You don`t like shrimps?
-No.


285
00:39:50.153 --> 00:39:52.312
FranÃ§oise, do you like shrimps?
No?


286
00:39:52.485 --> 00:39:54.747
How come?
Last week you ate some.


287
00:39:54.919 --> 00:39:57.441
Do you want tomatoes?
Do you like tomatoes?


288
00:39:57.618 --> 00:39:59.016
-l`m not hungry.
-Not hungry?


289
00:39:59.184 --> 00:40:01.650
lt doesn`t matter that
you don`t like shrimps.


290
00:40:01.817 --> 00:40:04.079
-But she likes shrimps.
-Do you?


291
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:07.339
But these are fresh, Antoine.

292
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.515
But, FranÃ§oise, you must eat something.

293
00:40:12.549 --> 00:40:14.208
What do you think while racing?

294
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:16.540
What is the most important thing?

295
00:40:19.348 --> 00:40:20.677
The throb of the motor.

296
00:40:23.013 --> 00:40:28.967
l know an engineer who uses
organ pipes for his exhaust.


297
00:40:29.179 --> 00:40:33.008
lt`s something that you feel
through your whole body.


298
00:40:34.578 --> 00:40:36.407
lt grips you like a fever.

299
00:40:37.144 --> 00:40:40.974
-l`m not thirsty, hungry. Sorry.
-l see.


300
00:40:41.376 --> 00:40:43.239
Antoine, say ``Coca
-Cola`` in Spanish.

301
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.398
Coca
-Cola.

302
00:40:44.577 --> 00:40:46.439
-Same as in French.
-No.


303
00:40:46.709 --> 00:40:50.300
Because the Spanish is ``Coca
-Cola.``

304
00:40:50.508 --> 00:40:52.134
How do you say ``l want a Coca
-Cola``?

305
00:40:53.808 --> 00:40:58.966
The waiter`s a Spaniard, so ask him
in Spanish for a Coca-Cola. Go on.


306
00:41:01.407 --> 00:41:03.395
Go on and ask him for it.

307
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.633
-He can give me some.
-We`ll get you another glass.


308
00:41:16.903 --> 00:41:18.425
Another glass, please.

309
00:41:22.969 --> 00:41:25.196
How come he speaks
such good Spanish?


310
00:41:25.535 --> 00:41:27.727
Actually, he speaks English too.

311
00:41:27.901 --> 00:41:29.491
Ask for a glass in English.

312
00:41:30.067 --> 00:41:33.658
-Yes, but the waiter is Spanish.
-He`s also English.


313
00:41:33.833 --> 00:41:36.060
His mum`s English, his dad`s a Spaniard.

314
00:41:36.433 --> 00:41:38.262
He understands both languages.

315
00:41:40.066 --> 00:41:43.361
-l`d rather say it in Spanish.
-You`re right.


316
00:41:43.631 --> 00:41:45.859
Because it`s more practical.

317
00:41:46.164 --> 00:41:48.426
After an accident, how do you feel?

318
00:41:49.398 --> 00:41:50.658
You feel ashamed.

319
00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:52.596
lt`s true, you`re ashamed.

320
00:41:53.397 --> 00:41:56.090
lt`s stupid, but that`s how it is.

321
00:41:56.563 --> 00:41:58.188
When you have an accident...

322
00:41:58.563 --> 00:42:01.824
...it`s your fault,
because you took a bend too fast.


323
00:42:01.995 --> 00:42:05.790
For instance, a bend that you`re
used to taking at 1 40...


324
00:42:06.028 --> 00:42:10.618
...if you go in at 1 41 , you leave
the track, at 1 39, you lose the race.


325
00:42:11.127 --> 00:42:13.422
You have to find the right speed.

326
00:42:13.793 --> 00:42:15.587
Say ``l love you`` in Spanish.

327
00:42:17.026 --> 00:42:18.321
-To who?
-FranÃ§oise.


328
00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:32.347
When something`s not serious,
we say it`s like a film.


329
00:42:33.522 --> 00:42:36.010
Why aren`t films taken seriously,
do you think?


330
00:42:39.022 --> 00:42:40.214
l don`t know.

331
00:42:41.154 --> 00:42:44.086
Maybe because we go
when everything`s okay.


332
00:42:44.921 --> 00:42:46.909
So we should go when it`s not?

333
00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.344
Why not?

334
00:42:50.286 --> 00:42:53.683
lt`s gone. Taken off.
The plane has taken off.


335
00:42:57.084 --> 00:42:59.073
-Can l clear the table, sir?
-Yes.


336
00:42:59.317 --> 00:43:01.215
-May l, madame?
-Yes, thank you.


337
00:43:03.184 --> 00:43:06.014
-Why do you break your cigarettes?
-To smoke less.


338
00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:09.206
You could smoke one less.

339
00:43:09.782 --> 00:43:10.770
True.

340
00:43:11.082 --> 00:43:12.479
Antoine`s suggested it.

341
00:43:13.915 --> 00:43:17.506
Have you ever thought of becoming
an actress?


342
00:43:19.414 --> 00:43:21.141
Yes, but it`d bore me.

343
00:43:21.613 --> 00:43:22.601
Why?

344
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.768
l`m not sure.

345
00:43:25.313 --> 00:43:30.370
Maybe because you need a little,
or not too much.... l don`t know.


346
00:43:31.545 --> 00:43:33.976
lt`s not that complicated, is it?

347
00:43:34.777 --> 00:43:37.766
No more difficult than being
a script girl or editor.


348
00:43:38.477 --> 00:43:40.704
-Really?
-l don`t know.


349
00:43:40.876 --> 00:43:44.069
You must have an idea.
After all, you watch films.


350
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:46.706
l don`t know, it`s not that difficult.

351
00:43:46.875 --> 00:43:50.329
lt`s not a question of it being
a difficult job.


352
00:43:50.974 --> 00:43:52.564
Everyone has their trade.

353
00:43:53.607 --> 00:43:57.629
When you`re good-looking,
it`s not that difficult to....


354
00:43:57.806 --> 00:43:58.897
You`re handsome.

355
00:43:59.072 --> 00:44:00.698
The director matters most.

356
00:44:00.872 --> 00:44:02.838
Why aren`t you an actor?

357
00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:05.170
You`re not bad-looking.

358
00:44:05.405 --> 00:44:07.802
No. The idea never crossed my mind.

359
00:44:07.971 --> 00:44:12.698
But if l worked in the film business,
l`d rather be an actor, l think.


360
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:15.926
No, l`m delighted with my own craft.

361
00:44:16.103 --> 00:44:18.194
No, l wouldn`t have liked acting.

362
00:44:18.702 --> 00:44:20.133
lt`s more serious to be....

363
00:44:20.302 --> 00:44:22.961
lt`s not more serious,
it`s more genuine.


364
00:44:28.067 --> 00:44:31.658
l have so many questions.
l go to the movies pretty often.


365
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.188
l have lots of questions.

366
00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:36.423
You must know a bit about films.

367
00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:39.655
No more than most.
l know a few things.


368
00:44:40.032 --> 00:44:41.793
l read some film magazines.

369
00:44:42.098 --> 00:44:44.189
Well, you know, l`m not....

370
00:44:44.465 --> 00:44:49.123
l`ve been in films for a short time,
l`ve not worked with the old hands.


371
00:44:50.763 --> 00:44:53.285
Tell me more about actors
and actresses.


372
00:44:53.496 --> 00:44:55.688
-Are you that interested?
-Of course.


373
00:45:12.026 --> 00:45:13.855
Have you had enough to eat?

374
00:45:14.025 --> 00:45:15.752
Yes, but l`d love a coffee.

375
00:45:15.925 --> 00:45:16.913
Coffee, please!

376
00:45:17.092 --> 00:45:18.682
Antoine, be quiet!

377
00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:24.054
What do you want to do?

378
00:45:24.257 --> 00:45:27.121
Me, nothing.
l want to play, that`s all.


379
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:28.880
How about a boat trip?

380
00:45:29.823 --> 00:45:31.152
Yes! Let`s go on a boat!

381
00:45:31.322 --> 00:45:32.548
-On a boat?
-Yes!


382
00:45:32.722 --> 00:45:33.949
-l promised?
-Yes.


383
00:45:34.122 --> 00:45:35.485
You remember l promised?

384
00:45:35.822 --> 00:45:37.287
-Have you been good?
-Yes.


385
00:45:37.455 --> 00:45:38.442
All week?

386
00:45:38.654 --> 00:45:39.813
Yes, he was!

387
00:45:39.988 --> 00:45:41.510
-Was he good?
-Yes, yes.


388
00:45:41.987 --> 00:45:43.453
Were you a good girl?

389
00:45:43.887 --> 00:45:45.443
-Shall we find a boat?
-Yes!


390
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:49.052
-Well, let`s go! Come on. We`re off.
-Yes!


391
00:45:49.719 --> 00:45:51.685
l`ll get there first!

392
00:45:53.552 --> 00:45:55.779
Go and get your coats quickly, then.

393
00:45:59.717 --> 00:46:03.739
You think it`s okay for us
to go on a boat?


394
00:50:00.872 --> 00:50:03.167
They are loving every minute.

395
00:50:04.171 --> 00:50:06.602
They get along pretty well together.

396
00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:09.435
They`ve been friends for a long time.

397
00:50:10.003 --> 00:50:11.298
Yes.

398
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:15.629
Antoine noticed her ages ago,
he said FranÃ§oise was pretty.


399
00:50:15.802 --> 00:50:18.892
He said he`d only spoken to her
a couple of times.


400
00:50:20.068 --> 00:50:21.795
lt`s so cute.

401
00:50:46.863 --> 00:50:49.351
Beautiful, that man and his dog.

402
00:50:52.662 --> 00:50:55.093
They walk alike.

403
00:50:55.261 --> 00:50:57.090
Yes, they do.

404
00:50:58.894 --> 00:51:02.223
Do you know Giacometti, the sculptor?

405
00:51:02.394 --> 00:51:04.450
Oh, yes. He was handsome.

406
00:51:04.726 --> 00:51:07.487
Well, Giacometti once said:

407
00:51:08.393 --> 00:51:13.949
``lf caught in a fire and l had to choose
between a Rembrandt and a cat...


408
00:51:14.125 --> 00:51:16.113
...l`d choose the cat.

409
00:51:17.024 --> 00:51:19.751
And then l`d let the cat go.``

410
00:51:19.924 --> 00:51:22.980
-Did he say that too?
-That`s what`s so wonderful.


411
00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:25.183
Yes, it is.

412
00:51:26.355 --> 00:51:29.479
Between art and life,
he said he`d choose life.


413
00:51:29.955 --> 00:51:32.785
-Beautiful.
-Yes.


414
00:51:34.254 --> 00:51:36.651
Why did you ask me that?

415
00:51:36.821 --> 00:51:38.843
-About Giacometti?
-Yes.


416
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.986
Because of the man and his dog.

417
00:53:04.104 --> 00:53:06.433
You never speak about your wife.

418
00:53:23.933 --> 00:53:26.797
My complete love
is with you always and forever.


419
00:53:26.966 --> 00:53:29.022
Every second, till the end.

420
00:53:29.566 --> 00:53:31.895
l love you, my darling!
l love you!


421
00:54:23.156 --> 00:54:27.417
Drivers are reminded it is forbidden
to have your engines running...


422
00:54:27.588 --> 00:54:30.781
...before the starting signal
is officially given.


423
00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:37.413
On the ready places, please.

424
00:54:43.685 --> 00:54:46.479
Everyone clear the track, please.

425
00:54:50.717 --> 00:54:53.547
One minute to go!

426
00:55:04.481 --> 00:55:06.276
Thirty seconds to go!

427
00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.311
Four seconds to go!

428
00:55:20.211 --> 00:55:21.472
Ready?

429
00:55:48.206 --> 00:55:50.069
This is the first lap.

430
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:55.466
I can`t tell you what`s going on now,
but it`s going to be very exciting.


431
00:55:55.671 --> 00:55:58.796
Millions of viewers...

432
00:55:58.971 --> 00:56:04.198
...have joined us for this race and will
stay with us for the next 24 hours.


433
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:08.563
By the time we get
to our next report at 1 0 p.m...


434
00:56:08.803 --> 00:56:15.132
...we have no doubt that the result
in the race will be far more predictable.


435
00:57:25.222 --> 00:57:27.779
As of this moment,
the Ferraris are leading.


436
00:57:27.955 --> 00:57:31.943
As you know, Jean-Louis Duroc
has had a smashup.


437
00:57:32.121 --> 00:57:37.212
He piled up his car on the straight
run of the grandstand. It looked bad.


438
00:57:37.386 --> 00:57:42.114
Jean-Louis Duroc was rushed
to the racetrack operating room.


439
00:57:42.285 --> 00:57:47.182
He is still in a coma, but we will keep
you informed on this subject.


440
00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:50.941
Right now, doctors are operating
on Jean-Louis Duroc.


441
00:59:19.167 --> 00:59:23.860
The fiendish pace continues with
the Ferraris still holding their lead.


442
00:59:24.033 --> 00:59:28.055
Last night produced a lot of dramatic
incidents and strained the machines.


443
00:59:28.232 --> 00:59:32.822
Fifty percent of cars dropped out, to say
nothing of Duroc`s serious accident.


444
00:59:32.998 --> 00:59:35.623
We reported
Jean-Louis Duroc`s accident.


445
00:59:35.797 --> 00:59:38.785
You know he underwent
a three-hour operation.


446
00:59:38.963 --> 00:59:45.292
But a personal drama took place
in the hospital as he was unconscious.


447
00:59:45.462 --> 00:59:49.985
However, let`s go back
to the track to Graham Hill.


448
00:59:50.161 --> 00:59:52.752
He`s at the pit
and still has a chance to win.


449
00:59:52.994 --> 00:59:57.187
A sheer tragedy
stalked the corridors of the hospital.


450
00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.519
Duroc`s wife
got to the hospital...


451
00:59:59.692 --> 01:00:03.283
...only to be told of her husband`s
critical condition.


452
01:00:03.492 --> 01:00:06.423
Then something awful happened.

453
01:00:06.591 --> 01:00:12.148
Mrs. Duroc was very seriously shocked,
and she suffered a nervous breakdown.


454
01:00:12.323 --> 01:00:18.017
It has just been confirmed
that she has taken her own life.


455
01:00:18.189 --> 01:00:19.916
For the moment,
we have no further details.


456
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:23.213
We shall keep you informed
as they come in.


457
01:00:23.388 --> 01:00:25.411
And now back to the track.

458
01:00:49.683 --> 01:00:53.774
All of next week, l`m going to be
driving in the Monte Carlo Rally.


459
01:00:53.949 --> 01:00:56.073
But as soon as l come back...

460
01:00:56.248 --> 01:00:58.941
...Montmartre 1 5-40.

461
01:01:02.181 --> 01:01:05.113
Well, then, good night.

462
01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:51.560
What time is it?

463
01:01:51.738 --> 01:01:53.761
Five past 1 .

464
01:01:54.905 --> 01:01:57.132
Did you have a good trip?

465
01:01:58.071 --> 01:01:59.661
How`s your son?

466
01:01:59.837 --> 01:02:01.768
Fine.

467
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:05.793
-And you?
-Fine.


468
01:02:08.501 --> 01:02:11.762
l`ve got some bad news for you.

469
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:17.259
l knew you didn`t find my desk.
l don`t suppose you looked for it.


470
01:02:17.434 --> 01:02:22.229
l went to all the antique dealers
in Deauville, but no desk.


471
01:02:22.399 --> 01:02:24.024
Too bad.

472
01:02:26.465 --> 01:02:29.295
Aren`t you going to undress?

473
01:02:29.864 --> 01:02:32.227
Right away.

474
01:02:34.964 --> 01:02:37.895
When am l going to meet your son?

475
01:02:38.063 --> 01:02:41.688
When he`s old enough
to make love to you.


476
01:02:41.862 --> 01:02:44.622
l`d make a good mother.

477
01:02:44.795 --> 01:02:47.226
l`m sure you would.

478
01:02:49.727 --> 01:02:54.250
What`s all this about
you going out with twins?


479
01:02:54.926 --> 01:02:57.619
Who told you that?

480
01:02:58.092 --> 01:03:00.683
The racing magazine.

481
01:03:00.858 --> 01:03:03.119
This one?

482
01:03:05.291 --> 01:03:07.052
Which page?

483
01:03:07.224 --> 01:03:10.780
Twenty-nine.

484
01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:13.850
That`s true.

485
01:03:16.755 --> 01:03:19.085
You missed the best parts.

486
01:03:19.255 --> 01:03:23.778
``Today, the driver Jean-Louis Duroc
met a young woman in Deauville.


487
01:03:23.955 --> 01:03:26.648
They spent the morning together...

488
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.911
...had lunch together,
spent the afternoon together...


489
01:03:30.086 --> 01:03:32.382
...then drove back to Paris.

490
01:03:32.986 --> 01:03:35.144
They left each other
just over half an hour ago.``


491
01:03:40.702 --> 01:03:43.293
Why are you telling me all this?

492
01:03:44.367 --> 01:03:46.889
Because it`s the truth.

493
01:03:47.067 --> 01:03:49.532
This paper never tells lies.

494
01:04:12.296 --> 01:04:17.284
Here in Rheims, capital of Champagne,
the town is bubbling with excitement.


495
01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:22.189
Excitement for the start of the

496
01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:27.656
...which is not being made any easier
by the difficult weather conditions.


497
01:04:27.826 --> 01:04:31.655
At this very moment, other competitors
leave from Oslo...


498
01:04:31.825 --> 01:04:33.518
...Minsk, London, Athens...

499
01:04:33.692 --> 01:04:37.521
...Lisbon and Hamburg,

500
01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:46.919
2 73 competitors
heading for Monte Carlo.


501
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:53.078
Here we see Jean-Louis Duroc
driving a Mustang and about to leave.


502
01:07:00.031 --> 01:07:02.360
Straight ahead, now.

503
01:07:10.795 --> 01:07:12.784
Fork left.

504
01:07:28.026 --> 01:07:29.184
Two miles.

505
01:07:49.855 --> 01:07:51.184
Now, hard left.

506
01:08:05.552 --> 01:08:10.506
Out of 2 73 cars that began,
only 80 are still in the running.


507
01:08:10.684 --> 01:08:16.014
Many accidents have occurred
and countless difficulties...


508
01:08:16.184 --> 01:08:19.411
...because of the extremely bad
weather conditions.


509
01:08:19.583 --> 01:08:25.208
They have literally transformed
the roads into ice rinks.


510
01:08:59.308 --> 01:09:01.035
Hairpin bend on the right.

511
01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.270
Sharp bend, left!

512
01:11:15.983 --> 01:11:22.176
The last and 42nd competitor
has just arrived at Monte Carlo.


513
01:11:22.348 --> 01:11:25.405
Forty-two cars...

514
01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:29.012
...these figures speak for themselves.

515
01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:33.839
A tough, grueling race
for both drivers and their cars.


516
01:11:34.013 --> 01:11:36.978
Tonight, Monte Carlo,
famed for its casino...


517
01:11:37.146 --> 01:11:42.043
...is decked out to give a big welcome
to the tired heroes of today`s race.


518
01:11:42.212 --> 01:11:46.473
We had hoped to bring you live
pictures of the prince and princess...


519
01:11:46.644 --> 01:11:50.769
...but they were not able to be present
for the finish of the rally...


520
01:11:50.943 --> 01:11:53.341
...as we understand
they are away skiing.


521
01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:57.736
Therefore, they did not present
the trophy to the winners...


522
01:11:57.908 --> 01:12:02.431
...who in fact aren`t the real winners...

523
01:12:02.608 --> 01:12:07.005
...because, as you know, Wakinen and
the other competitors driving Coopers...


524
01:12:07.173 --> 01:12:08.434
...should have won.

525
01:12:08.606 --> 01:12:14.061
However, a detail in one of the many
regulations deprived them of victory...


526
01:12:14.239 --> 01:12:17.931
...but these trifles, we expect, will
be overlooked at tonight`s banquet...


527
01:12:18.105 --> 01:12:21.400
...given in honor of the competitors
at the Sporting Club....


528
01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:22.798
Hello?

529
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:26.663
Hello, l want to send a telegram
to Monte Carlo.


530
01:12:26.837 --> 01:12:28.769
Yes, l`ll wait.

531
01:12:35.402 --> 01:12:37.333
Yes, Monte Carlo.

532
01:12:37.501 --> 01:12:39.592
Mr. Jean
-Louis Duroc.

533
01:12:39.767 --> 01:12:43.097
Duroc. With a C.

534
01:12:43.266 --> 01:12:47.096
l haven`t got the address
with me, unfortunately.


535
01:12:47.266 --> 01:12:48.697
l`m sorry to trouble you.

536
01:12:48.866 --> 01:12:51.058
lt won`t be difficult to find him.

537
01:12:51.232 --> 01:12:54.322
He`s in the Monte Carlo Rally.

538
01:12:55.298 --> 01:12:57.321
That`s most kind of you.

539
01:12:58.564 --> 01:13:00.052
Yes! That`s it.

540
01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:04.628
The Sporting Club will find him.
Let me see, now....


541
01:13:07.329 --> 01:13:11.556
``Bravo! l saw you on TV. Anne.``

542
01:13:12.395 --> 01:13:14.587
No, no, wait a second.

543
01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.814
``Bravo! l love you. Anne.``

544
01:13:23.159 --> 01:13:25.215
Yes, please, yes.

545
01:13:25.392 --> 01:13:27.381
Montmartre 1 5-40.

546
01:13:27.559 --> 01:13:31.251
Miss, how long will it take?

547
01:13:32.691 --> 01:13:34.179
Thank you.

548
01:15:48.632 --> 01:15:51.359
-Evening, sir.
-Sorry to draw you out in this cold.


549
01:15:51.532 --> 01:15:53.861
lt is a bit nippy tonight,
but we mustn`t complain.


550
01:15:54.031 --> 01:15:56.326
Comes during this time of the year.

551
01:15:56.497 --> 01:15:59.156
Super or regular?

552
01:15:59.329 --> 01:16:01.022
Super.

553
01:16:12.094 --> 01:16:14.855
-Fill it up, please.
-Fill it up?


554
01:16:17.093 --> 01:16:19.684
l`ll fill it up for you,
but it`s difficult for us.


555
01:16:19.859 --> 01:16:22.484
Never comes out even
and all the odd change.


556
01:16:22.659 --> 01:16:27.852
Every morning l have to do my accounts,
and that`s not my strong point--


557
01:16:28.024 --> 01:16:32.251
-Okay, then make it 50 francs.
-50 francs, that will be fine, sir.


558
01:16:39.156 --> 01:16:44.281
-Aren`t you going to turn it on?
-Yes, but your cigarette.


559
01:16:48.554 --> 01:16:52.679
Sending that telegram really is
something. Takes guts to do that.


560
01:16:52.853 --> 01:16:58.648
Imagine, a woman
sends a cable like that to a man.


561
01:16:58.819 --> 01:17:01.546
I`d never have the guts to do that.

562
01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:05.275
A wonderful woman.

563
01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:13.246
If I keep going like this,
I should be in Paris around...


564
01:17:15.049 --> 01:17:17.481
...say, 6:30.

565
01:17:18.915 --> 01:17:22.074
She`s still in bed at 6:30.

566
01:17:22.314 --> 01:17:25.905
What will I do? 
I can go to a bistro...

567
01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.241
...give her a call....

568
01:17:29.413 --> 01:17:33.674
When a woman sends you
a telegram, ''I love you''...


569
01:17:33.845 --> 01:17:36.242
...you go and see her.

570
01:17:36.745 --> 01:17:41.904
Sure, I can go and see her...

571
01:17:42.077 --> 01:17:45.736
...but I don`t know which floor she`s on.
I`d have to wake the concierge.


572
01:17:49.176 --> 01:17:52.835
The concierge will say,
''She`s not in, '' or, ''You can`t go up. ''


573
01:17:53.008 --> 01:17:57.702
I`ll answer, ''Look, I`m sorry,
but I`ve just driven 2000 miles...


574
01:17:57.875 --> 01:18:02.329
...in fact, 3000 miles
to come and see her.


575
01:18:02.507 --> 01:18:05.337
I`m very sorry, but...

576
01:18:05.507 --> 01:18:07.529
...I`m going up!''

577
01:18:07.706 --> 01:18:11.535
Up I go! I
ring the bell, once, twice.

578
01:18:11.705 --> 01:18:15.193
No, I think I`ll only ring once,
don`t want to upset her.


579
01:18:15.371 --> 01:18:18.825
Once is enough.

580
01:18:19.003 --> 01:18:22.457
She`ll take time to wake up,
perhaps she doesn`t open her door.


581
01:18:22.636 --> 01:18:24.727
She says, ''Who`s there?''

582
01:18:24.902 --> 01:18:27.198
And I answer, well....

583
01:18:28.935 --> 01:18:31.423
What will I say?

584
01:18:31.602 --> 01:18:33.726
I can`t say, ''It`s Jean
-Louis. ''

585
01:18:34.401 --> 01:18:36.492
''Antoine`s father, '' I`ll say.

586
01:18:36.667 --> 01:18:40.723
Antoine`s father.
Yes, that sounds better.


587
01:18:40.899 --> 01:18:44.195
''Who`s there?''
''Antoine`s father. ''


588
01:18:44.365 --> 01:18:47.490
She opens the door...

589
01:18:50.798 --> 01:18:53.320
...and we`re face-to-face.

590
01:18:56.263 --> 01:18:59.058
She`s a little embarrassed.

591
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:03.786
After all, she sent me
a telegram, ''I love you. ''


592
01:19:05.328 --> 01:19:07.351
She`s embarrassed. It`s normal.

593
01:19:07.528 --> 01:19:12.152
She`s home, and she`s embarrassed.

594
01:19:13.726 --> 01:19:18.522
And she says, ''
I`ll make some coffee.

595
01:19:18.892 --> 01:19:21.222
You`ve come a long
way, you need it. ''

596
01:19:21.392 --> 01:19:25.756
I walk in-- No,
now I have to say something.


597
01:19:25.924 --> 01:19:29.753
What a coward! So I say....

598
01:19:32.024 --> 01:19:35.955
Should I stop off in Lyons
and send her a telegram?


599
01:19:36.123 --> 01:19:39.486
Yes, it`s a good idea.
No, it`s not, it`s stupid.


600
01:19:39.655 --> 01:19:43.882
My telegram would arrive
only a few minutes before I do.


601
01:19:44.054 --> 01:19:50.384
She`ll break her sleep, and when
I get there, I`ll wake her again.


602
01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:55.547
Lucky I`ve still got time
to think of something better.


603
01:21:10.005 --> 01:21:13.528
-Anne Gautier`s apartment.
-Third floor.


604
01:21:54.163 --> 01:21:56.287
Sorry, but l can`t get any answer.

605
01:21:56.463 --> 01:22:00.020
She doesn`t always tell me
what she`s doing.


606
01:22:07.561 --> 01:22:09.186
Police!

607
01:22:09.361 --> 01:22:13.053
l think she went to Deauville
to see her daughter.


608
01:22:13.226 --> 01:22:15.249
Much obliged.

609
01:22:35.656 --> 01:22:37.212
l was extremely surprised
to see you back.


610
01:22:37.389 --> 01:22:41.013
l saw you on television last night
at the Monte Carlo Rally.


611
01:22:41.188 --> 01:22:43.676
Do you think that if l go that way
l may run into them?


612
01:22:43.854 --> 01:22:47.286
Yes, you`re almost sure to.
Past the big pier.


613
01:22:47.454 --> 01:22:49.612
The pier? Oh, yes!

614
01:22:49.786 --> 01:22:54.342
lf they come back while l`m looking
for them, tell them to wait for me.


615
01:22:54.518 --> 01:22:57.348
See you in a while!

616
01:32:45.441 --> 01:32:47.737
But why?

617
01:32:55.339 --> 01:32:56.999
Why?

618
01:33:02.471 --> 01:33:04.528
Because of my husband.

619
01:33:06.737 --> 01:33:08.895
But he`s dead.

620
01:34:20.324 --> 01:34:22.948
l think l`d better take the train.

621
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:56.339
Prepare my bill, please. Room 41 .

622
01:34:56.517 --> 01:35:00.039
And when is the next train for Paris?

623
01:37:01.626 --> 01:37:03.091
ls it direct?

624
01:37:03.259 --> 01:37:05.248
No, l have to change.

625
01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:14.688
For what reason did you say
your husband was dead?


626
01:37:15.723 --> 01:37:17.552
Because he is.

627
01:37:17.723 --> 01:37:20.211
Not yet, for me.

628
01:37:22.589 --> 01:37:26.282
Some Sundays start well and end badly.

629
01:37:26.588 --> 01:37:29.247
It`s hard to believe.

630
01:37:29.421 --> 01:37:32.477
It`s crazy to refuse happiness.

631
01:37:46.051 --> 01:37:49.074
If I had to go through this again,
what would I do?


632
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:52.704
Is there anything else I could do?

633
01:37:53.483 --> 01:37:57.381
To see her for months
on end as a pal.


634
01:37:57.549 --> 01:38:02.140
What happens?
You end up being pals, maybe.


635
01:38:07.347 --> 01:38:10.108
She wired, ''I love you. ''

636
01:38:10.713 --> 01:38:14.076
Admit it, boy, you just don`t
understand women.


637
01:38:15.512 --> 01:38:19.000
Her husband
must have been quite a guy.


638
01:38:19.179 --> 01:38:21.371
Maybe if he had lived...

639
01:38:24.477 --> 01:38:30.807
...he`d have become an old fool,
but as it is, he`ll always be quite a guy.


640
01:38:33.242 --> 01:38:36.106
Though he might`ve turned into
an old fool.


641
01:38:36.275 --> 01:38:41.139
They might`ve made
a wonderful couple...


642
01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:45.302
...or a dreary pair of old fools.

643
01:38:45.873 --> 01:38:49.305
-Are the Lyons sausages hot?
-Yes, sir.


644
01:38:49.473 --> 01:38:53.734
-Where are they?
-Hors d`oeuvres.


645
01:38:53.906 --> 01:38:55.565
I don`t see it. 
Where is it marked?

646
01:38:55.738 --> 01:38:58.465
Lyons sausages. Milan sausages,
that`s cold, isn`t it?


647
01:38:58.638 --> 01:39:01.126
Oh, yes, always cold.

648
01:39:01.537 --> 01:39:04.765
What is the salmon?

649
01:39:04.936 --> 01:39:08.232
Freshwater fish
imported from Finland.


650
01:39:10.636 --> 01:39:12.999
-Do you know it?
-No.


651
01:39:14.135 --> 01:39:16.123
-What am I going to have?
-I don`t know.


652
01:39:16.301 --> 01:39:17.698
I`m not hungry.

653
01:39:18.067 --> 01:39:20.055
Would you like a steak?

654
01:39:20.233 --> 01:39:21.665
Yes. I think so.

655
01:39:21.833 --> 01:39:24.924
Chateaubriand`s the most tender,
isn`t it?


656
01:39:25.099 --> 01:39:27.690
That`s right, sir.

657
01:39:29.632 --> 01:39:31.530
Two Chateaubriands, grilled.

658
01:39:31.698 --> 01:39:33.391
Well-done or rare?

659
01:39:33.564 --> 01:39:36.587
-Rare, for me.
-Rare for me too.


660
01:39:36.764 --> 01:39:39.786
-And hot!
-Of course, sir.


661
01:39:41.429 --> 01:39:44.792
Last night, what time
did you leave Monte Carlo?


662
01:39:44.962 --> 01:39:48.086
l left....

663
01:39:50.928 --> 01:39:54.382
You want nothing to start with, then?

664
01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.582
He`s not too pleased with us.
We didn`t order enough.


665
01:40:01.759 --> 01:40:03.657
You want me to make him happy?

666
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:16.251
Do you have a room?

667
01:43:01.426 --> 01:43:02.413
