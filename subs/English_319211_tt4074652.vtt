00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.622
WE MONSTERS

2
00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:37.719
Do you like it?

3
00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:40.724
I wrote it for you.

4
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.693
A bit of a squeaky voice.

5
00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.287
I'll come and pick you
up in just a few days.

6
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.182
Pull over to the right. 
-Why?

7
00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.862
Just do it. Charlie's waiting. 
We're taking her with us.

8
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.356
Who? Charlie? Why didn't anyone tell me?

9
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.601
You can call mum if you want.

10
00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.179
Hi. Charlie. 
-Hi.

11
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.217
Nice to meet you.

12
00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.789
So you're coming to camp as well?
-Yes.

13
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.922
It's going to be great.

14
00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:43.354
Are you new at Sarah's school? 
-No, I'm at another school.

15
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.263
But I'll be gone soon.

16
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.833
Can I have one, too?

17
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.253
Can you give me the lighter?

18
00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.332
Who texed you? 
-Let go.

19
00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:29.567
What is it?
- It doesn't concern you!


20
00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.342
Charlie, show it to me.

21
00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.376
Since when is he texing you?
- Don't make such a fuss!


22
00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.848
Are you shitting me?
- Calm down. It wasn't for you.


23
00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.621
You can't be serious!
- Maybe I'm more interesting to him.


24
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.248
You've got to be kidding.
What kind of a friend are you?


25
00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:49.362
Could you pull over to the right?
Nature calls.


26
00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.236
Come on, settle down!

27
00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.464
God, Sarah!

28
00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:03.739
Chill out!

29
00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.888
Hi mon cœur. You ok?

30
00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:20.891
Just put her on the guest list.
That'll be fne.


31
00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:26.293
It'll be fne.

32
00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:28.797
So, are you chickening out?

33
00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:34.406
No, you stay with Nick.
I'll pick you up.


34
00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:37.703
I think... 45 minutes or so.
An hour.


35
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.405
Ok?

36
00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.704
Yes. See you then. Bye.

37
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.351
Sarah?

38
00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.370
Sarah!

39
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.843
Ok, you won!

40
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.352
Ha, ha, very funny!

41
00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:32.497
Come on, girls!
Playtime is over!


42
00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.407
Sarah!

43
00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.577
Sarah! Where are you guys?

44
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:50.876
Dad!

45
00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:55.811
Sarah!

46
00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:57.614
Stay put!

47
00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:01.788
Hold on!

48
00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:04.893
Hold on to the rails!

49
00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.397
What are you doing?

50
00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:12.562
Where is Charlie?

51
00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.949
Charlie!

52
00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:14.033
I think you should come with me.

53
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.498
Ok? Come on!

54
00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.199
I can't go with you.

55
00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.038
You have to.

56
00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.131
Come on darling, it'll be fne.

57
00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:24.939
Dad, I pushed her.

58
00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:27.705
What?

59
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.918
What did you say, darling?

60
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:36.780
Sarah?

61
00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.684
I pushed her.

62
00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.779
You didn't push her, darling.

63
00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:10.990
She just fell. 
It was an accident.

64
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:17.526
Darling, that can't be true.

65
00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:20.098
You're confusing things.
It's not your fault. She slipped.


66
00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:25.170
Stop this madness! We're going in and you
tell them it was an accident, understood?


67
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.267
It was no accident, dad!

68
00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:35.003
We have to get our stories straight.

69
00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:42.675
We'll say she ran off
at the parking lot, ok?


70
00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:45.777
Understand? She just ran off.

71
00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:47.643
Can you say that?

72
00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.722
The cell phone was a birthday present.

73
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.325
It would suck if it was broken.

74
00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:55.852
It's not going to work.

75
00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.657
Will it work again once it's dry?
- Pull yourself together!


76
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.094
We should have been there already

77
00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.769
I need you with me, ok? 
Come on, think!

78
00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.867
She's not even registered.

79
00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:09.002
What did you say?

80
00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:11.041
She wanted to sneak in, because of me.

81
00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:13.243
Why because of you?

82
00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:16.145
Because I didn't want to go alone.

83
00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:20.653
Why did she sneak in?

84
00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:22.248
No one knows.

85
00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:25.156
What do you mean, no one knows?

86
00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:27.020
No one knows about it.

87
00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:29.787
Her parents?

88
00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.662
Her father wouldn't let her come.

89
00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.132
He'd blow a fuse.

90
00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:44.373
And you?

91
00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:46.372
What?
- Did you tell anyone?


92
00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:48.406
Hello?

93
00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.376
Paul?

94
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.248
Oh, thank God!

95
00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:54.683
Sound check is now an hour earlier.
They just called.


96
00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:56.948
They want us there now.
Hi Sarah!


97
00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:00.758
Did something happen?

98
00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.893
She doesn't want to go to camp.

99
00:11:08.768 --> 00:11:10.100
What do you mean?

100
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.096
Nick is waiting outside.
We have to go.


101
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.967
I could come with.

102
00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:18.236
Yeah. Ok.

103
00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:19.970
No, she is not coming.

104
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:23.781
Sarah, hey!

105
00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:28.252
What's the matter?

106
00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:32.423
We have to go.

107
00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:34.693
No. No. No.
I'm not going.


108
00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:36.921
Excuse me?

109
00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:38.763
I'm not going.

110
00:11:42.802 --> 00:11:43.895
Ok...

111
00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:53.439
Watch out!

112
00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:57.773
Is that yours?

113
00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.252
See you tomorrow.

114
00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:15.262
I love you.

115
00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:59.972
Holiday is going to be great.
I'm feeling it.


116
00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:05.510
The person you have called
is currently unavailable.


117
00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.187
The battery is dead, that's all.

118
00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.948
Both?

119
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:15.157
Well, sometimes she is just
as chaotic as her dad.


120
00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:21.827
They have internet at the hotel.
We'll fnd the camp's number.


121
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.938
I can already hear her, "Mom, you're
so embarrassing," as soon as I call.


122
00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:27.829
Sure.

123
00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:33.073
Thank you.

124
00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:37.147
Thanks for doing this together.

125
00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.579
Thank you for doing this together.

126
00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:37.535
Morning.

127
00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:39.172
Good morning.

128
00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:47.246
So? What shall we do now?

129
00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:56.259
No clue.

130
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:59.064
I thought we could
do something together.


131
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.962
Dad, please!

132
00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.897
Has something not gotten through to you?

133
00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:15.143
Fine, we won't do anything...

134
00:15:16.348 --> 00:15:18.044
I'm nothing to you anyway!

135
00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.005
Are you ready?

136
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.415
You used to write songs
for mum all the time.


137
00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:59.514
Do you love Jessica?

138
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.089
Ok.

139
00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:08.257
Then sing.

140
00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:14.403
Like in the bath. Ok?

141
00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:41.701
That was pret bad, wasn't it?

142
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.592
No, not at all.

143
00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:48.034
Let's do it one more time, ok?
- Ok.


144
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.142
That's me, right?

145
00:17:01.387 --> 00:17:03.219
Yes, that'll be on the cover.

146
00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:05.780
You can keep it.

147
00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:11.561
Concentrate.

148
00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:37.280
Hi Sarah, how's it going?

149
00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:39.250
Did you fnish recording?

150
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.152
Do you want to sing together?
Should I come over?


151
00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:45.456
That was supposed to be my song!

152
00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:55.500
Sarah!

153
00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:57.402
Sarah!

154
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.175
What is the matter?
Is it me? Can I do something?


155
00:18:01.346 --> 00:18:03.372
Stay home, in case she comes back.

156
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.778
Paul, I...
Dammit!


157
00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:10.239
I bet they're sitting there,
playing cards.


158
00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:12.213
Give me something to bite,
so I don't scream.


159
00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:15.788
I closed the nursery
to go on vacation with you.


160
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:17.919
Everything's always a mess.

161
00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:23.626
Is it here?

162
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.389
Yeah, I think so.

163
00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:28.598
Ok, come on.

164
00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:38.668
I just got back as well.
I had a concert yesterday.


165
00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.340
And where'd she go?

166
00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:44.881
She ran off, Paul chased after her.
They'll surely be back shortly.


167
00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:47.880
She's going through a diff cult phase.

168
00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:50.415
I thought: 'God knows what had happened.'

169
00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:52.490
No, it'll be fne I think.

170
00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:56.886
I was the same at that age.
I know how it is.


171
00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:59.427
It's a bit chilly, isn't it?

172
00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:02.501
No, no. Are you cold?

173
00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:06.405
It gets only warm in here when we jam.
Because of the amps.


174
00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:09.235
We only have soymilk, is that ok?

175
00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:16.677
Sorry about the gig.

176
00:20:16.848 --> 00:20:18.612
I'm sorry about the vacation.

177
00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:25.583
Thank you.

178
00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:33.856
What are you doing here?

179
00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:36.397
I want to know how Sarah's doing.

180
00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:39.330
Why don't you answer the phone?
I've been calling since yesterday.


181
00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:41.439
I don't know where she is.

182
00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.303
What does that mean?

183
00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.441
It means, I don't know
where she is right now, ok?


184
00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.260
Where is this playground?

185
00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:12.268
I dunno, somewhere around here.
Michael, over there! I'm going over there.


186
00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:17.468
Sarah!

187
00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:39.632
We'll be in the car in a sec.

188
00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:43.501
Wait, I have...

189
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.770
Let me go!

190
00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:53.636
No! I want to go to Charlie!

191
00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.746
We're not going to your place!

192
00:21:56.014 --> 00:21:59.542
Everything will be fne, ok?
- You guys are the worst.


193
00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:01.615
Paul, we are going to my place!

194
00:22:03.355 --> 00:22:05.324
We'll meet at your place, ok?

195
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.857
What are you doing?
- What does it look like?


196
00:22:22.107 --> 00:22:23.666
I wanna...

197
00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:26.676
Sarah!
- We're going to go home frst.


198
00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:29.070
This is my week with Sarah!

199
00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:32.815
'our week." Super week!
We're going to my place, and that's fnal!


200
00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:35.947
Forget it!
- I have to tell you...


201
00:22:36.121 --> 00:22:37.521
Enough! Stop it!

202
00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:39.948
Who are you snapping at?

203
00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:43.093
Mum, I'd rather go to your place.

204
00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:47.058
Did you hear what your daughter said?

205
00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:03.771
You've had her twice, in two months...
- Not now. Not in front of her.


206
00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:07.818
You knew it was this week.

207
00:23:08.019 --> 00:23:10.682
So what? For you it's always 'his week".

208
00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:15.753
I don't owe you anything.
Where were you the frst 9 years?


209
00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:20.465
That again? The superdaddy
and the shit mother who was never home?


210
00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.827
What were we supposed to live off of?
Sunshine and music?


211
00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:24.799
Use the amp for a heater, or what?

212
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.599
If I would have had the chance
to make my music, yes!


213
00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:29.901
Blah blah blah.

214
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.839
Who did she run away from?

215
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:34.403
It was obvious
that she'd fip out around you!


216
00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:35.945
You make me sick!

217
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:42.451
Where are you going?
This way has been closed for ages.


218
00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:57.125
What are you doing?

219
00:23:57.502 --> 00:23:59.471
Paul, have you lost it?

220
00:23:59.671 --> 00:24:01.071
Seriously, now...

221
00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:05.801
You are still there.

222
00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:16.178
Can I have a moment with her alone?

223
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.833
You were mean.

224
00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:47.601
What do you mean?

225
00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:50.247
You weren't there on my birthday.

226
00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.646
But you know why.

227
00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.146
Sarah.

228
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.849
Look at me.

229
00:25:57.989 --> 00:26:00.083
You can't tell anyone.

230
00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.258
Understood?

231
00:26:03.628 --> 00:26:05.722
No one can fnd out!

232
00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:08.633
Why weren't you there on my birthday?

233
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.268
Because I had a gig.

234
00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:14.104
And your mother's not allowed to fnd out.

235
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.132
Do you understand, darling?

236
00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:18.809
I won't. Not a word.

237
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:20.239
Promise.

238
00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.039
Good.

239
00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:23.273
Good.

240
00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:26.777
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning,
then we'll do something together.


241
00:26:27.018 --> 00:26:28.179
Whatever you want.

242
00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:31.020
Dad?

243
00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:33.118
Yes?

244
00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:36.657
Do you think she's sexy?

245
00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:40.062
Who?
- Charlie.


246
00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:43.291
You were staring at her tits.

247
00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:46.762
I watched you stare right at them.

248
00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:03.747
First her birthday and now this.

249
00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:05.853
She's not all there.

250
00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:07.959
Come on, she's an adolescent.

251
00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:11.219
That doesn't explain everything.

252
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:15.362
We just dragged Sarah
all the way across the feld.


253
00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:18.631
Is he always like that?

254
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:24.906
I have to do something about Paul.

255
00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.715
What are we going to do now?

256
00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:34.980
I just called the hotel.

257
00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:38.949
Thank you.
- You're welcome.


258
00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:45.427
She's asleep.

259
00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:48.900
I will pick her up tomorrow morning.
- Paul, maybe...


260
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.966
I'm not having this discussion.

261
00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:53.328
I will be here tomorrow at 10 a.m.

262
00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:14.722
I don't know if you know it,

263
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.988
but I like children.

264
00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:20.826
Especially when they're super drunk,
puking on your shoes.


265
00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:23.459
Oh man...

266
00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:29.765
I like them a
lot more when they're young.

267
00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:36.739
You're cray.

268
00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:45.315
You're absolutely cray.

269
00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:24.762
What's that?

270
00:29:26.297 --> 00:29:27.856
A children's song.

271
00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:35.801
I never sang it to her.

272
00:29:35.974 --> 00:29:37.340
No?
- No.


273
00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:39.171
Strange, huh?

274
00:29:41.846 --> 00:29:43.109
It's nice.

275
00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.551
The house there, everything...

276
00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:55.353
When I was there, it was, as if...

277
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.861
As if I'd never lived there.

278
00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.262
Did it change that much?

279
00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:03.428
No, not really.

280
00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:07.896
I should have left much earlier.
- Yes.


281
00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:15.006
It's strange how comfort blinds you.

282
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.055
As comfortable as us?

283
00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.287
No, not that bad.

284
00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:45.370
Morning.

285
00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:49.244
Thanks! We also slept great.

286
00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:51.974
I'm taking off again, ok?

287
00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:55.153
Don't buy too much, ok?
We want to leave tomorrow.


288
00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:13.268
Why is that so flthy?
- It was in the jacket you puked all over.


289
00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:18.543
Didn't go so well with dad, huh?

290
00:31:19.944 --> 00:31:22.004
Better than it did with you!

291
00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:32.981
Sarah, we gave it some thought.

292
00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:36.020
We thought you'd maybe come with us.

293
00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:40.190
I'm not going anywhere with that jerk-of

294
00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:41.333
You know what?

295
00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:45.569
After the stunt you pulled yesterday,
there is nothing to discuss.


296
00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:54.437
What is he doing here?

297
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.577
Morning, Mr. Kuszinsky.
- Is Charlie here?


298
00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:05.456
No, why?
- She hasn't been home for two days.


299
00:32:05.623 --> 00:32:06.682
You're kidding!

300
00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:10.051
Sarah and her are so close.
Maybe she knows something.


301
00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:12.163
Yes, of course. Sarah?

302
00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:16.624
She's run away before, but not this long.

303
00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:19.061
Do you know where Charlie is?

304
00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:22.671
So, did you survive your birthday?

305
00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:25.039
Was she at your place afterwards?

306
00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:28.175
Yes, the girls took champagne from me.

307
00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:31.714
Well, they wanted to at least.
I yelled at Charlie for it too.


308
00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:34.145
You know where she is, don't you?

309
00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:35.478
No.

310
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.012
Well, she wasn't here at least.

311
00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:40.989
Can I go to my room?

312
00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:42.992
Yes, of course.

313
00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:47.689
Have you been to the police?

314
00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:54.335
She'll pop up soon.
- We'll let you know if we hear anything.


315
00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:55.973
Bye.
- Thanks.


316
00:32:58.309 --> 00:33:00.005
Can't you leave me alone?

317
00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:12.553
What are you doing?

318
00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:15.353
I'm packing your things.
- I'm not coming with!


319
00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:21.599
What's up with Charlie?

320
00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:25.503
You know where she is.
- No, I don't.


321
00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:32.236
If you two got into a fght,
then maybe a break is the way to go.


322
00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:34.139
You don't have a clue.

323
00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:38.339
Charlie is dead.
- What's that all about?


324
00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:52.121
What's that about?

325
00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:30.357
Why didn't you go to the police?

326
00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:33.495
I did.
We were standing there.


327
00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:37.125
Then she tells me
she pushed her on purpose.


328
00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:38.701
On purpose!

329
00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:41.333
What should I have done?

330
00:35:47.678 --> 00:35:51.274
Then we drove back home.
I had to clear my head frst.


331
00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:54.908
Then she tells me that no one knew
that Charlie was with us.


332
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.213
Then Jessica came...

333
00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:00.389
Then it was really late.

334
00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:13.695
Fine, we'll call a lawyer now
and tell the police it was an accident.


335
00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:17.208
Do you realize what's at stake here?

336
00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:20.209
Why? She's a minor.
- At 14, not any more.


337
00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:21.710
Not in such cases.

338
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.343
Even if she gets away with it...

339
00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:28.250
What if everyone knows about it?

340
00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:31.253
School, facebook,
family, friends, everyone.


341
00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:33.882
She couldn't handle it.

342
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.402
Did anyone see you?

343
00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.742
No, I don't think so.

344
00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:56.881
Did anyone see you, yes or no?
- No!


345
00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:59.378
Ok, I'm going there now.
- Where?


346
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:01.644
To the lake, I
have to see for myself.

347
00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:13.522
Are you fnished?

348
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.565
We're going to the reservoir.

349
00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:24.839
Do I have to come?

350
00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:28.509
I don't know if I can.

351
00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:37.721
Maybe it would be better
if you stayed here.


352
00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:52.669
You call if there's anything, ok?
- Yes, I promise.


353
00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.361
Where was it?

354
00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:20.396
There.

355
00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.469
Right about there.

356
00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.351
Shit.

357
00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:53.558
Come on, let's go.

358
00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:57.598
Christine, come on, let's go.

359
00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:26.022
I was wondering
if I should focus on biology.


360
00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:29.398
During project week Mr. Dietrich called me
a "diamond in the rough."


361
00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:39.443
It's nice eating together again.

362
00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:43.605
I need to go to the bathroom.

363
00:39:52.923 --> 00:39:56.621
If she were to transform into an alien,
it wouldn't surprise me.


364
00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:57.921
Me neither.

365
00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.868
Why did she do it?

366
00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.478
I've been asking myself that.

367
00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:18.040
I don't have the stomach to ask.

368
00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:22.147
What should we have done?

369
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.612
Stayed together for her sake?

370
00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:27.456
We should have separated much earlier.

371
00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:33.597
You didn't tell him, did you?

372
00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:36.026
Did you tell Jessica?

373
00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:38.602
No.

374
00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:43.030
You can't tell anyone.

375
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:45.104
I wasn't planning on it.

376
00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:48.036
I don't mean just now.
I mean ever.


377
00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:56.950
We'll do that again sometime, ok?

378
00:40:57.555 --> 00:41:00.081
Are you coming over tomorrow?
- Of course.


379
00:41:01.692 --> 00:41:03.957
I'm going to my room, ok?
- Sure.


380
00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:09.560
We have to act completely normal, ok?

381
00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:14.703
See you tomorrow.
- Yes.


382
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.233
Paul!

383
00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:19.804
Who's there?
- Charlie's father.


384
00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:22.737
Holy shit!

385
00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:27.782
What should we tell him now?
- No clue.


386
00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.921
Don't open the door!

387
00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:41.030
What does he want here?

388
00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:58.276
He's gone.

389
00:42:07.057 --> 00:42:09.049
He'll be back, that's for sure.

390
00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:11.558
We have to think of what to say.

391
00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:24.206
Why won't you let me in?
I just wanted to speak to Sarah.


392
00:42:24.575 --> 00:42:27.170
Hey, get a hold of yourself.
I just want to talk, ok?


393
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:29.980
Get out of here!
Go, I said!


394
00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:31.716
Get out of here I said!

395
00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.578
Get your hands off of me!

396
00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:37.281
What's wrong with you?

397
00:42:38.622 --> 00:42:40.682
Get out of here
or we'll call the police!

398
00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:42.850
Get out of here!

399
00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:02.903
Dad?

400
00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:06.877
Yes, Sarah?
- Is everything ok?


401
00:43:07.851 --> 00:43:09.285
Everything is ok.

402
00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:10.780
We'll be right back.

403
00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:12.048
Careful.

404
00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:17.319
Heads up.

405
00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.196
Does he know anything?

406
00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:27.203
No... I don't know.

407
00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.302
And what if he goes to the police?

408
00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:36.610
Lean back.

409
00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:41.615
Careful.
Heads up.


410
00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:48.624
Paul.

411
00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:50.626
What?

412
00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:53.898
Maybe we should go frst.

413
00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:59.863
Excuse me, I'm looking for Ms. Benthin.

414
00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:02.097
Let me check.
Would you like to sit for now?


415
00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:03.672
Yes, thanks.

416
00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.109
Christine!

417
00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:46.110
Hello.
- Hello.


418
00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:50.814
You aren't here, because I haven't paid
for the school trip, right?


419
00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:52.081
No.

420
00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:53.689
No, I...

421
00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.886
We are worried about Charlie.

422
00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:58.925
She's Sarah's best friend.

423
00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:04.031
When we called, he showed up at our door.
Threatened us, threatened Sarah.


424
00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:06.693
Paul tried to stop him.
- Paul?


425
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.065
Are you two...?

426
00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:10.730
Oh no, he was there for Sarah.

427
00:45:12.276 --> 00:45:14.745
Yes, well...
And then?


428
00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:24.079
He knocked Paul to the ground.

429
00:45:24.788 --> 00:45:28.384
It's probably nothing
and Charlie is probably fne, but...


430
00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:30.489
That reaction, you know. I...

431
00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:32.460
Do you want to fle charges?

432
00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.197
Against the father of her best friend, no.
- Here, 2004.


433
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.793
2 years probation.

434
00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:40.160
Had a problem with alcohol.

435
00:45:40.804 --> 00:45:43.364
Rehab...
Daughter was in foster care.


436
00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:46.268
Yeah, then I think we'll drop by.

437
00:45:46.443 --> 00:45:48.435
But we should speak to Sarah frst.

438
00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.342
What?
No way!


439
00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:11.065
Do you get along well with Michael?

440
00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:15.768
He gave me that new cell.
Brownnoser.


441
00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:18.804
He probably meant well by it.

442
00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.979
That's the opposite of nice.
You always say it yourself.


443
00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.281
He'd move in if he could.

444
00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:27.879
If mum wants him to.

445
00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.045
And what about me?

446
00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:34.856
Maybe you just need to talk with mum.

447
00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:41.091
Do you have someone?

448
00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:42.957
A boyfriend?

449
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.492
No.
- No?


450
00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:53.807
Why did you do that?

451
00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:05.952
Why did you push her?

452
00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:09.825
Hello!

453
00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:11.592
I've brought someone with me.

454
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:13.854
Please.

455
00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.499
Hello Paul.
- Hello.


456
00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.424
It's been a while.

457
00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:19.502
He landed quite the punch.

458
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.530
When did you last see Charlie?

459
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.940
At her birthday.

460
00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:30.410
Yeah, at my birthday.

461
00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:33.449
Did you notice anything odd about her?

462
00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:38.455
They were just celebrating.

463
00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:43.454
And you haven't heard from her since?

464
00:47:43.894 --> 00:47:45.590
No, nothing.
Right, Sarah?


465
00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:47.294
No texs?

466
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:50.592
No, nothing.
- No, I asked her that myself.


467
00:47:51.568 --> 00:47:53.594
Could I please speak to Sarah by myself?

468
00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.597
I won't bite, Sarah.

469
00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:57.998
Does she have to?

470
00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:00.109
It doesn't make a difference.

471
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:02.973
It would be easiest for all of us.

472
00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:06.274
You could have said
that we asked her everything.


473
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.885
That's what I did, but she's hardcore.

474
00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:16.084
He struck Charlie?

475
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.419
Because you took a bottle
of champagne without asking?


476
00:48:20.597 --> 00:48:23.032
Yes, but... it was just a slap.

477
00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.595
Completely harmless, really.

478
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:30.998
He even gave me the bottle later,
as a present.


479
00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:33.567
Was he drunk that night?

480
00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:39.477
Was he drunk that night, Sarah?

481
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.615
So yes...

482
00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:47.981
No, he never drinks anything!
He was an alcoholic.


483
00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:51.322
I mean... addicted, or something.

484
00:48:51.495 --> 00:48:53.623
I am certain, that Charlie's fne.

485
00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:56.292
She'll pop up in a couple of days.

486
00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:58.594
Thanks, Sarah.

487
00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:12.579
I'll explain it to you tomorrow, ok?
I'll call you.


488
00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:19.282
Just do something nice.
You're free tonight.


489
00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:24.718
Does it still hurt?

490
00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:46.514
I love you, dad.

491
00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:51.221
Good night!

492
00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:52.751
Good night.

493
00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.701
You can put them on yourself.

494
00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.328
Thanks.

495
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.278
They'll suspect him.

496
00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:21.085
Maybe they won't.

497
00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:30.327
Help yourself if you need
a towel or anything.


498
00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:32.019
Yeah, ok.

499
00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:34.594
Sleep well.
- You too.


500
00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:39.762
Finally...
- Have you been home yet?


501
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.292
No. I'll go back in a sec.

502
00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:48.337
Danny is waiting outside.
He's so sweet.


503
00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.867
So caring.
So nice.


504
00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:53.369
You can't do that,
they are going cray.


505
00:51:53.543 --> 00:51:54.602
You asked for it.

506
00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:58.707
But not like this.
- They all stood you up. Assholes.


507
00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:02.376
With the camp and everything.
Did you forget already?


508
00:52:05.322 --> 00:52:08.588
Your father was here.
He's really worried about you.


509
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.726
He can bawl his eyes out.

510
00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:15.666
That asshole shouldn't have hit me.
- He hit my dad.


511
00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:17.698
Wow, that's so like him.

512
00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.561
The police were here.
They questioned me.


513
00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:22.603
Shit, how embarrassing.

514
00:52:22.772 --> 00:52:24.798
Do they buy the water corpse thing?

515
00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:26.609
I don't know.

516
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.904
But it's getting pret freaky now.

517
00:52:29.279 --> 00:52:31.271
Hey, where's my cool bitch?

518
00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:34.149
Now you can do something for me.

519
00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:35.747
Please.

520
00:52:58.208 --> 00:52:59.767
Mr. Kuszinsky?

521
00:53:02.879 --> 00:53:04.313
Yes?

522
00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:09.212
Good day.

523
00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:10.954
It's about your daughter.

524
00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:15.659
Charlie isn't here right now.
Can I pass something along?


525
00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:19.459
You're from child services, aren't you?

526
00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:35.438
Good morning, dad.
- Morning.


527
00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:42.548
We have to bury the backpack.

528
00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:47.918
Maybe Charlie didn't drown.

529
00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.887
Do you want an egg, dad?

530
00:53:51.494 --> 00:53:52.484
Yeah, sure.

531
00:53:55.298 --> 00:53:56.732
That thing has to go.

532
00:53:57.901 --> 00:53:59.494
We have to get rid of it.

533
00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:02.932
Maybe she saved herself somewhere.

534
00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:09.310
Please don't address that
in front of Sarah.


535
00:54:09.479 --> 00:54:11.641
You see that she can't deal with it.

536
00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:16.251
Ok.

537
00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:30.861
I'll try it now.
- It's not going to work.


538
00:54:31.301 --> 00:54:32.860
Better than burying it.

539
00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:43.406
Are you fastened in?

540
00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:09.836
Salut mon cœur.

541
00:55:10.874 --> 00:55:12.866
Yes, everything's fne.

542
00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:16.342
Hey, I forgot to pick up
the CDs yesterday.


543
00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.847
Let's see how they look.
No idea.


544
00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:22.712
Hello?

545
00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:26.482
No, it doesn't matter.
If not then...


546
00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:29.685
Then we'll reprint them, ok?

547
00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:32.890
Ok, ok...

548
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:34.928
Christine?

549
00:55:36.333 --> 00:55:37.801
Where's Christine?

550
00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:39.593
In the nursery with Sarah.

551
00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.863
In the nursery?
- Yes.


552
00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:45.565
Bye.

553
00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:21.072
I don't know if I can access
a computer again.


554
00:56:21.478 --> 00:56:24.038
Just stop already!
Jesus, I'm coming.


555
00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:27.042
But you're coming tomorrow?
- Yeah, then rising again.


556
00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.941
Jesus style.

557
00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:30.814
They are worried sick about you.

558
00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:33.388
Cray, just imagine
if they get back together.


559
00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:34.922
Yeah, I dunno...

560
00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:36.621
And you?

561
00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:39.159
He's making grimaces all the time.

562
00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:43.431
Keep your head up, everything's fne.
I gotta go.


563
00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:50.135
Shit!

564
00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:55.769
What are you doing here?

565
00:56:57.547 --> 00:56:59.641
I...
This is for the compost.


566
00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:02.081
No, I mean, what are you doing HERE?

567
00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:04.687
We had a date.

568
00:57:04.854 --> 00:57:06.846
But you forgot.
- I...


569
00:57:07.023 --> 00:57:08.992
I've got a lot
f oating around my head.

570
00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:10.858
I've met Paul.

571
00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:14.128
Sarah wanted him to stay the night.

572
00:57:14.864 --> 00:57:16.628
I... I love you.

573
00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:24.031
It's not all that great right now.
- Let's just go home. I'm done here.


574
00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:49.464
Sarah, turn it of
Food's ready.


575
00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:52.228
Please.

576
00:57:58.208 --> 00:58:01.645
That's ok, right?
What we talked about earlier?


577
00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:03.104
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:06.777
Hello.

579
00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.511
Looks great.
Thanks.


580
00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:13.881
You're welcome.
- I'm going to eat in my room.


581
00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:16.652
No, you are not.
You sit down now, otherwise...


582
00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:18.988
Otherwise what?
I'm grounded?


583
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.125
Let it go.

584
00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:24.192
You don't stand a chance.

585
00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:35.535
She's a monster.
- It'll be fne.


586
00:58:35.945 --> 00:58:37.675
She'll get used to it.

587
00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:39.208
To what?

588
00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:41.847
Us together...
A family.


589
00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:45.278
I have vacation days.
We have time.


590
00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:47.089
We can take trips...

591
00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:49.889
... go to the cinema.

592
00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:52.789
If it doesn't work out,
then I can just leave.


593
00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:56.226
Michael, don't be mad,
but we can't do that.


594
00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:06.098
Can't do what?

595
00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:10.546
You moving in.

596
00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:45.212
Michael!

597
00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:52.745
Michael, you're getting it wrong.
Please don't drive off.


598
01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.012
So? Are you fghting?

599
01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:25.846
I'd rather have pizza anyway.
- Go to your room.


600
01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.863
Go to your room,
I don't want to see you.


601
01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.659
Chill out.
- Me?


602
01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.699
I should chill out?
- Yes...


603
01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:41.133
Do you have any idea,
what you're ruining?


604
01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.136
Have you lost your mind?

605
01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:49.409
You'll see for yourself.
"It's all in your best interest."


606
01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:50.644
What?

607
01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:55.108
That's what you said, after dad left.

608
01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:28.374
The lamps are lit

609
01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:33.217
The day is done

610
01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.349
And Cod

611
01:01:38.461 --> 01:01:42.262
swims home

612
01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:47.130
Elephant

613
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:51.272
comes home

614
01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:54.876
Little ant

615
01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:59.211
crawling home

616
01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.875
The lamps are lit..

617
01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:04.020
Hi.
- Salut mon cœur!


618
01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:10.925
Not bad, huh?
- Yeah, I think it's cool.


619
01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:13.261
Hello.

620
01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.827
Where did you get the lyrics?

621
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.299
Where did you fnd them?
- I just found them.


622
01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:21.766
You found them?
- Yeah.


623
01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.520
Will you be staying
the night more often...?


624
01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.458
No clue.

625
01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.798
Say something.

626
01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:54.201
It has nothing to do with Christine.

627
01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:58.535
No, it has to do with you.
That's why I'm asking.


628
01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:01.077
It has to do with me?
- Yes.


629
01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.847
Where are you?

630
01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.490
Who is that?

631
01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.235
What do you want?

632
01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:34.138
You have to help me.

633
01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.877
Please!

634
01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:52.957
They think I did something...

635
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:56.028
... to my daughter, understand?

636
01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:57.461
Good...

637
01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.337
I've given her a smack before.

638
01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.564
Like anyone, you know how that is.

639
01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.068
Not like anyone!
You almost broke my nose.


640
01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.108
I have to speak with Sarah!

641
01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:10.177
She knows me.
Please!


642
01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:13.346
I'll see what I can do.
- Please!


643
01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:16.018
I just wanna talk!
- Go home!


644
01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:19.119
What did I ever do to you?

645
01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:22.457
What did I do to you?

646
01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:44.504
Who was that?
- It was the father of...


647
01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:48.642
The father of one
of Sarah's friends from school.


648
01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:54.318
He's a violent type and they think
he has something to do...


649
01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:57.085
... with the fact
that her friend is missing.


650
01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.586
She's missing?

651
01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.926
Yes.
- That's cray.


652
01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:04.999
Yes...

653
01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:08.134
What did he want from you?

654
01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.267
Talk to Sarah.

655
01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.567
But I won't allow it.

656
01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:18.481
She's totally broken because her friend...

657
01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:22.275
Besides, she told the police
everything she knows.


658
01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.417
Why didn't you tell me that?

659
01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:32.028
I didn't want to bother you,
with the gig and everything.


660
01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:38.565
I'm sorry.

661
01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:41.633
I'm really sorry, 
I was jealous.

662
01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:45.441
I was jealous of your family.
That's so antiquated.


663
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.673
I'm sorry.

664
01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.372
Excuse me.

665
01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:06.846
I saw the car and I thought...

666
01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:10.653
You have to help me! The cops think
I did something to my daughter.


667
01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:12.719
You understand?

668
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:14.717
You're a good person.

669
01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:19.754
I'm sorry.
I haven't had a drink in three years.


670
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.357
I got my shit together for her.

671
01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.664
I'd never do anything to my Charlie.

672
01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:28.533
I need to speak to Sarah.
- I'll see what I can...


673
01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:29.635
... do.

674
01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.514
What did you do to her?

675
01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:46.722
The squid light up the water.

676
01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:50.348
And all the other fsh
think it's moonlight.


677
01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:51.527
Nick, what's up?

678
01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:54.859
Can't you be more elegant?

679
01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.231
It's packed.

680
01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.525
Ok.

681
01:08:58.767 --> 01:08:59.735
Hey?

682
01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:01.837
Don't you want to go out?

683
01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.872
And tell your squid story outside?

684
01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:09.636
Am I making you nervous?
- Yeah, you make me nervous.


685
01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:19.280
Paul?
- Not without me.


686
01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:58.660
Paul? Where are you, godammit?
We need to go!


687
01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:00.489
Jessica?
- Yeah, I'm coming.


688
01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:02.461
We need to go! Ok.

689
01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.497
Right now!
- Yeah, I'm coming.


690
01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:05.828
Bye!

691
01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:35.387
Butterf y

692
01:10:37.466 --> 01:10:40.334
is coming home

693
01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.832
Little bear

694
01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:47.941
is coming home

695
01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.904
Kangaroo

696
01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:55.417
is coming home

697
01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:58.978
The lamps are lit

698
01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:02.588
And day is done

699
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:15.833
He's here.

700
01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:17.564
Where are you?

701
01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.538
In the nursery.

702
01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:20.767
He knows everything!

703
01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:21.978
Ok, settle down.

704
01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:24.006
What did you do with her?

705
01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:26.380
Fuck!

706
01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.715
Christine?

707
01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.427
Move!

708
01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:43.331
Fox and goose

709
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.635
coming home

710
01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:50.930
Cat and mouse

711
01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:54.340
coming home

712
01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:58.342
Man and wife

713
01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:01.447
coming home

714
01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:05.480
The light's ashine

715
01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:09.422
The day is through

716
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:17.727
Everything sleeps

717
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:21.336
Everything wakes

718
01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:25.006
Everything cries

719
01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:28.636
And everything laughs

720
01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:32.040
Everything hushes

721
01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:36.610
And everything chatters

722
01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:41.083
Everything is, what nobody knows

723
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:47.586
Everything shouts

724
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:50.797
And everything listens

725
01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:54.832
Everything dreams

726
01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:58.672
And everything swaps

727
01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:02.537
itself with itself

728
01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:04.972
In this life

729
01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.578
The evening is sitting

730
01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.543
On our house

731
01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.596
Get the frst-aid thing!

732
01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:05.868
Now!

733
01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:12.072
Everything will be fne.

734
01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.465
And then?

735
01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:38.855
Get out!
Help me!


736
01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.728
Throw it over there.

737
01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:54.772
In front of the bike!

738
01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:58.770
Shit!
Watch out!


739
01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:04.947
Come!

740
01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:15.363
Shit!

741
01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:46.991
From today, it'll be open, they said.

742
01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:54.202
They said from today, we can get through.

743
01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:58.130
From today, here is open.

744
01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:03.177
From today, here is open, they said.
They said, from today we can...


745
01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:05.075
From today, we can get through.

746
01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:08.982
They said that from today,
we can get through.


747
01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:14.280
From today, we can get through, they said.

748
01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:17.684
From today...

749
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.122
From today we can get through...

750
01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:26.464
From today we can get through...

751
01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:46.014
I just kept driving.

752
01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:52.854
I know.

753
01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:11.029
We are monsters.

754
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.086
I know.

755
01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:33.643
I'll go get the car.

756
01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:31.767
Ms. Kuszinsky?

757
01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:01.363
Let's leave the car in your garage.

758
01:24:04.072 --> 01:24:05.665
You shut the door, right?

759
01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:07.300
Yes.

760
01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:12.239
Good morning!
- Morning.


761
01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:16.074
What are you doing here?
I thought you had a gig.


762
01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:20.452
It was cancelled.
I...


763
01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:22.649
I had to speak
to mum for a sec.

764
01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:25.319
Ok...

765
01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.467
Are you upset?
About yesterday?


766
01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:37.070
No.

767
01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.169
I have to tell you something.

768
01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.178
What?

769
01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:49.341
It's about Charlie.
- Sarah...!


770
01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.285
Her father was here yesterday.

771
01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:56.386
He was at the door, just a wreck.

772
01:24:57.792 --> 01:25:00.523
I didn't open the door.
He was so drunk.


773
01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:08.327
I didn't kill Charlie.

774
01:25:12.507 --> 01:25:14.476
She's still alive, really.
You can call her.


775
01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:18.440
Sarah, we know it's hard for you.
- No, really, I'm not cray!


776
01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:23.813
We wanted to get back at you.

777
01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.321
Because you left me alone.

778
01:25:27.589 --> 01:25:30.354
On my birthday, and then the camp thing.

779
01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:34.258
You only think of yourselves.

780
01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:41.194
What are you saying?

781
01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:49.369
I wanted to tell you earlier...

782
01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:52.237
But Charlie didn't want me to.

783
01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.212
So, and where is Charlie off to now?

784
01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:06.457
She's with her new lover.
He lives nex to the reservoir.


785
01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:09.564
We checked it out earlier,
with the parking spot.


786
01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:15.737
Sarah, you said that Charlie is dead.

787
01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:20.439
Yeah, but she's alive.

788
01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:58.339
Mum?

789
01:27:03.851 --> 01:27:05.581
Mum, say something!

790
01:28:16.424 --> 01:28:17.653
You have to help me.

791
01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:21.761
We don't have to do this now.

792
01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:25.857
We have to wipe it clean.

793
01:28:45.586 --> 01:28:47.452
What are you doing here?

794
01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:53.989
My father is dead.
- What?


795
01:28:56.931 --> 01:28:59.628
The police said that details
are scarce right now.


796
01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:04.067
He was pret drunk.

797
01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:06.604
How would you know?

798
01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:11.106
He was here yesterday.
Looking for you.


799
01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.808
I didn't have the
courage to let him in.

800
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:18.345
Shit, if only I would have
said something...


801
01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:26.084
But you didn't.

802
01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:29.757
Neither did you.

803
01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:33.767
Where you off to now?
- What the fuck's it to you!


804
01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:36.528
Hey, I can't do anything about it!
Charlie!


805
01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:44.901
There's no trace of an accident
on the bicycle.


806
01:30:58.019 --> 01:30:59.783
He could have fallen off.

807
01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:01.847
He was drunk.

808
01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.960
We shouldn't have thrown it down there.

809
01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:10.790
Why should anyone think
it wasn't an accident?


810
01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:14.159
We should have run over it!

811
01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:26.676
Where were you then?

812
01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:33.146
We were worried!
What are you guys doing?


813
01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:36.722
Why did you do that?

814
01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:39.717
What do you mean?

815
01:31:41.562 --> 01:31:43.497
I'm really sorry about your father.

816
01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:47.567
We'll be there for you.

817
01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:50.233
You?

818
01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:53.740
You ran him over and let him die!

819
01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.738
It was an accident.

820
01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:01.073
Your father was drunk.
- Tell it to the police!
