1
00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:39.404
Frankenstein's Jewish.
Yeah.


2
00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.505
The whole thing is Nazi propaganda.

3
00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:44.644
I don't think that's accurate.

4
00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:48.344
No, no, no. Okay. I, I know
that sounds crazy, but really,


5
00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:51.324
after studying the, the
back cover art of the book


6
00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:52.564
for a little while now,

7
00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:54.945
that's the only explanation
that logically fits.


8
00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:58.145
I always thought of
Frankenstein more as Cherokee.


9
00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:04.545
You, you thought of
Frankenstein as Roki. Look,


10
00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:07.564
Maybe we should give him a ride.

11
00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:09.985
- Why?
- Well, it's the Christian thing to do.


12
00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.614
What's he even doing out here?

13
00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:15.865
Only one way to find out,

14
00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:20.124
Hey, do you need a ride? Yeah.

15
00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:23.004
Oh, I've been staying around
here since the show ended.


16
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:28.005
My car broke down. Where
are you headed? Oh, Lucy's.


17
00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:32.604
Well, come on. Thanks. I
really appreciate this.


18
00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:35.723
Oh, that's no problem. 
That was my idea.

19
00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:37.964
That's the Christian thing to do. Yeah.

20
00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:39.283
You might be a blown stranger,

21
00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:41.414
but there's nothing wrong
with being a Buffett fan.


22
00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:44.164
What can possibly go wrong? Right.

23
00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:47.223
You know, you are
All right, man. Thanks.


24
00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:49.154
Interesting show tonight, huh? Yeah, man.

25
00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:53.944
Jimmy, all you can eat can
never be topped. Nope. Indeed.


26
00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:56.065
That, that's precisely
what I was thinking.


27
00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:59.625
You know, that was
my 27 time seeing him.

28
00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:04.204
Really? Oh my God. You
must be a, a really big fan.


29
00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:06.384
Wow. Oh yeah. I have my own band

30
00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:09.265
that covers his music called
The Well Tan G String.


31
00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:14.004
Right on dude. Wow.

32
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.464
Though it's really impossible
to play all of his songs


33
00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:17.894
with only one string.

34
00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:21.823
Yeah. Yeah. Such a great show tonight.

35
00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:24.745
I just wish he had played Crayola Crayola.

36
00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:27.045
I'm not sure I'm familiar with that.

37
00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:30.764
You mean you've never heard of Crayola?

38
00:02:30.765 --> 00:02:32.664
What'd she just say? 
You Little Beach?

39
00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:34.784
I don't know much. 
Jimmy's always

40
00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:36.064
been more my wife's thing.

41
00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:37.404
I,

42
00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:39.704
We listened to the whole
album on the way to the show.


43
00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.224
What are you talking about?
I are you guessing me again?


44
00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:43.784
That's what you're doing. I don't, I don't

45
00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:46.244
- Really recall
- You Such a piece of shit.


46
00:02:46.245 --> 00:02:48.264
That's what it is. Have
you even memorized a


47
00:02:48.265 --> 00:02:49.644
track listing of Florida Days?

48
00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:51.124
No. Huh?

49
00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.004
You know, I never really
cared for that album. Oh


50
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:55.364
My God.

51
00:02:55.365 --> 00:02:57.484
You know what? You guys
are just a bunch of posers.


52
00:02:57.485 --> 00:03:01.354
She probably just run off and
go join the No Shoes Nation.


53
00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:05.154
It's 1993. Stop the car, Gerald.

54
00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:08.844
That, that, that's just I
am, you know what? I'm done.


55
00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:11.484
You're the one driving dearest.
Oh my God. You, that's it.


56
00:03:11.485 --> 00:03:16.485
That's it. That's it. You open
the door, get out, get out.


57
00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:19.714
It's time that, you know,
you finally listen to that,


58
00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:21.984
that therapist, you, you love so much,

59
00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:23.784
and it takes some personal space.

60
00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:25.354
But you can't stay here.

61
00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:28.073
It's out in the middle of
nowhere on a Sunday night.


62
00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.024
Come Monday, I'll be all right.

63
00:03:30.025 --> 00:03:33.504
- Hey,
- You stop talking. That shithead Posr.


64
00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:38.165
And, and you, Gerald, if the
phone doesn't ring, it's me.


65
00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:50.225
So long time coming.

66
00:03:53.824 --> 00:03:55.924
You know, Macy, some people
would say that you're really


67
00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:59.444
to blame for this, but
really, it's nobody's fault.


68
00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:00.445
I gotta tinkle.

69
00:04:09.255 --> 00:04:13.334
- Aw crap.
- I think we have a flat tire.


70
00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:14.335
- Oh,
- No.


71
00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:20.985
Seriously.

72
00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:29.334
- What the
- Hell? Son of a beach.


73
00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.955
Hey, Macy, have you
seen my salt Shakers?


74
00:04:46.255 --> 00:04:50.894
Mac? See Mac. See Mac?

75
00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:55.774
See Macy? Where are you?

76
00:04:55.775 --> 00:04:58.154
Oh, I blew up my flip flop.

77
00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:03.435
Oh, shit.

78
00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:20.274
- I don't need the backstory.
- Just


79
00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:21.275
Get to the facts.

80
00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:27.234
- Hey,
- In the Bayou the Moon,


81
00:05:27.235 --> 00:05:31.354
so bride friends for
a while, Jimmy Knight,


82
00:05:31.355 --> 00:05:35.104
guitar Showman, kilo taking
flight underneath the stars.


83
00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:37.575
Everything just feels all right.

84
00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:42.615
- Oh,
- Just feels all right.


85
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:46.784
So race up our glass.

86
00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:49.274
Let's out Cheer to the single damn reason

87
00:05:49.275 --> 00:05:51.034
why we're all here.

88
00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:54.004
Got friends. Byside. 
Another Kanga wrong.

89
00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:57.725
Grab a damn beer and
help me sing this song.


90
00:05:59.305 --> 00:06:02.725
- Oh,
- Sing this song.


91
00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:09.645
Welcome to this place where
the fun is in the air.


92
00:06:11.535 --> 00:06:15.125
Heads gathered. Not one
of us with anger, air


93
00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:21.045
with drinks in our hand and
keys gone for the night.


94
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.064
We toast to tomorrow.

95
00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:28.485
And that painful morning

96
00:06:34.105 --> 00:06:36.365
to be all that's right.

97
00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:42.424
It's gonna be alright. Alright.

98
00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:44.725
You hook me up
with a crazy chick again.

99
00:06:45.945 --> 00:06:49.114
Didn't say crazy. 
I said paranoid.

100
00:06:49.115 --> 00:06:52.054
Yeah. Well, that's like your
personal point of view, man.


101
00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:53.564
Don't go this way. The light

102
00:06:53.565 --> 00:06:55.144
down here, it makes you wait forever.

103
00:06:55.145 --> 00:06:56.145
We could take another

104
00:07:01.895 --> 00:07:03.134
No, let him sleep.

105
00:07:03.135 --> 00:07:05.274
It doesn't smell like he
shit his pants yet. Yeah.


106
00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:06.275
I don't smell 'em.

107
00:07:12.735 --> 00:07:14.624
So this party thing, we're going to,

108
00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:17.454
it's like an all you
can eat food festival.


109
00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:20.394
No, it's, it's a Jimmy
Buffett's impersonator


110
00:07:20.395 --> 00:07:23.054
contest. It's not a buffet.

111
00:07:23.055 --> 00:07:24.674
Oh. I thought

112
00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:27.195
that meant there was like
a dinner show or something.


113
00:07:28.075 --> 00:07:30.634
I can't believe I let
you talk me into coming.


114
00:07:30.635 --> 00:07:32.714
I don't even like Jimmy Buffet. Everybody

115
00:07:32.715 --> 00:07:34.344
Loves Jimmy Buffett.

116
00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:38.075
He's an American icon.
Like Jerry Springer,


117
00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:46.375
Man.

118
00:07:53.775 --> 00:07:54.608
Oh.

119
00:07:54.609 --> 00:07:59.354
- Oh, where's the party
- Dude?


120
00:07:59.355 --> 00:08:01.174
What are you wearing?

121
00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:02.555
Me? It's pirate garb.

122
00:08:03.705 --> 00:08:05.414
Look like you're from the middle ages.

123
00:08:05.415 --> 00:08:06.664
You're middle aged pirates.

124
00:08:06.665 --> 00:08:07.995
Yeah. What middle aged pussies?

125
00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:12.275
- Shit.
- What?


126
00:08:13.385 --> 00:08:15.384
- It's a Jeep.
- What's a Jeep?


127
00:08:15.385 --> 00:08:17.134
It's a four wheel
drive altering vehicle.


128
00:08:17.135 --> 00:08:21.814
No, it's, it's not a what?
It's a who? It's a some bum.


129
00:08:21.815 --> 00:08:24.264
We pay to look after the place.

130
00:08:24.265 --> 00:08:25.745
What? Is he dangerous or something?

131
00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:30.715
Not really. I'd say he
is more sad, to be honest.


132
00:08:32.195 --> 00:08:34.934
I think his wife left him
high and dry years ago


133
00:08:34.935 --> 00:08:37.533
and never really recovered.

134
00:08:37.534 --> 00:08:39.194
And honestly, I think

135
00:08:39.195 --> 00:08:40.875
that was probably the
last time he was dry.


136
00:08:41.615 --> 00:08:44.574
- But he's a bitch.
- No, like he's an alcoholic.


137
00:08:44.575 --> 00:08:45.915
Oh, nice. I,

138
00:08:46.865 --> 00:08:49.274
That being said, better play it safe.

139
00:08:49.275 --> 00:08:51.435
Don't take any candy. 
He brings you.

140
00:08:52.305 --> 00:08:53.305
Good call.

141
00:09:07.305 --> 00:09:10.005
Hey, Jeep. How's it going?

142
00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:19.155
Okay, good talk.

143
00:09:21.265 --> 00:09:22.925
You don't wanna go down to that water.

144
00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:29.264
- Why is that exactly
- That thing down there?


145
00:09:29.265 --> 00:09:32.605
It ain't right. 
It ain't natural.

146
00:09:34.435 --> 00:09:35.725
Okay. What thing?

147
00:09:41.135 --> 00:09:44.174
- Opera shark.
- Excuse me.


148
00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:46.304
About six months back,

149
00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:48.564
Ladies and gentlemen, a
terrible tragedy this evening.


150
00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:53.394
Indeed. A talker who goes
by the handle opera Daddy


151
00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:55.874
was tragically eaten alive by a shark.

152
00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:57.234
We have footage of the event

153
00:09:57.235 --> 00:09:58.614
and we are about to
play it for you now.

154
00:09:58.615 --> 00:10:00.094
Now, if your discretion is advised,

155
00:10:00.095 --> 00:10:01.454
because you will have to listen

156
00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:03.644
to some opera music. 
Let's roll the tape.

157
00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:08.645
What is up my fellow
hashtag shark aficionados?


158
00:10:08.765 --> 00:10:13.354
It's me. Your favorite opera
singer? Hashtag opera Daddy.


159
00:10:13.355 --> 00:10:16.274
Follow me on TikTok,
follow me on Instagram.


160
00:10:16.275 --> 00:10:20.455
And I am just
out here so excited about

161
00:10:21.315 --> 00:10:26.315
sharks and I have been
introduced to this smear


162
00:10:26.415 --> 00:10:29.514
campaign about our thin friends.

163
00:10:29.515 --> 00:10:31.874
And I'm here to tell you,
I don't appreciate it.


164
00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:35.935
So as a show of my
support, I'm here to engage


165
00:10:36.795 --> 00:10:40.984
in the art of song with
my fellow thin friends.


166
00:10:40.985 --> 00:10:43.145
Isn't that right? We're gonna
hit 'em with a little, we


167
00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:02.094
They say, you could still
hear the muffled sounds of


168
00:11:02.095 --> 00:11:06.734
that sad, tragic clown when

169
00:11:06.735 --> 00:11:07.735
that thing draws near.

170
00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:12.254
So the guy's still alive, isn't

171
00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:13.255
There?

172
00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.095
Well, yeah. The shark ate him hole.

173
00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:18.295
- I'll steer clear the water,
- The sun too.


174
00:11:20.275 --> 00:11:22.575
You're kind of tying my
hands here, man. It's a camp.


175
00:11:24.675 --> 00:11:27.375
- That's what she thought too.
- Who?


176
00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:30.875
Karen.

177
00:11:38.685 --> 00:11:42.305
All right, Jeep. 
We'll see you later.

178
00:11:43.805 --> 00:11:46.154
Ugh. What the shit, dude?

179
00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:48.434
Sorry, friend. Didn't
mean to panic your pickle.


180
00:11:48.435 --> 00:11:51.954
Panic My what? Oh, don't
mind. Old four wheeler there.


181
00:11:51.955 --> 00:11:53.254
Perky. Karen's death.

182
00:11:53.255 --> 00:11:54.764
Death had nothing to do with the amount

183
00:11:54.765 --> 00:11:57.565
of s pf one 50 on her skin.

184
00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:02.274
That right? Everyone
around these parts knows


185
00:12:02.275 --> 00:12:04.504
that it was coronal, mass eject.

186
00:12:04.505 --> 00:12:08.864
Or like the city slickers.
Call it solar flare.


187
00:12:08.865 --> 00:12:11.404
It erupted a bunch of solar radiation

188
00:12:11.405 --> 00:12:13.914
that deflected off the Aurora Boreal

189
00:12:13.915 --> 00:12:17.544
that amazingly reflected
right through the window


190
00:12:17.545 --> 00:12:20.064
of our friendly neighbor's Ace's big rig.

191
00:12:20.065 --> 00:12:23.514
And while those Scientologists
said it created an effect


192
00:12:23.515 --> 00:12:25.805
like an ant under a microphone.

193
00:12:27.505 --> 00:12:30.494
Wait, you say Scientologists?

194
00:12:30.495 --> 00:12:34.314
I'm sorry. I guess I had a
slippery tongue phenomenon.


195
00:12:34.315 --> 00:12:38.394
I meant gynecologist. Of course,
her death was no big deal.


196
00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:41.574
I mean, her poetry was not well received.

197
00:12:41.575 --> 00:12:44.595
Is this guy an escaped
mental patient? No.


198
00:12:46.375 --> 00:12:47.475
No. That's Gareth.

199
00:12:48.805 --> 00:12:50.644
- Garth.
- Gareth,


200
00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:52.534
- Garth,
- Gareth.


201
00:12:52.535 --> 00:12:56.875
I'm sorry. One more time. I
I can come here. Come, come.


202
00:12:58.215 --> 00:13:02.795
Gareth. Oh, it's Gareth. It's Gareth.

203
00:13:04.255 --> 00:13:05.574
So where you standing behind this wall?

204
00:13:05.575 --> 00:13:07.414
Man, you, you hiding something?

205
00:13:07.415 --> 00:13:10.784
No. Good fences. Make
good neighbors. What?


206
00:13:10.785 --> 00:13:13.354
What the, how'd you get back here?

207
00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:15.634
I pulled a sneaky one on you.

208
00:13:15.635 --> 00:13:17.234
I squeezed down the brown hole when your

209
00:13:17.235 --> 00:13:18.374
back was turned. You did.

210
00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:21.784
- You did what to me.
- I went through the hole.


211
00:13:21.785 --> 00:13:22.785
Made a hole.

212
00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:29.775
Guys, I think I need a
drink and a long ass shower.


213
00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:36.994
Well, we'll be seeing you, Gareth.

214
00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:38.735
Always a pleasure. Double J.

215
00:13:39.815 --> 00:13:44.234
Taste this. Oh,

216
00:13:44.235 --> 00:13:46.624
that tastes like straight tequila.

217
00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:48.164
It is.

218
00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:52.315
Who's ready to get drunk and screw? Oh,

219
00:13:53.885 --> 00:13:54.885
We're not snuff queens.

220
00:13:55.865 --> 00:13:57.504
What the hell is a snuff queen?

221
00:13:57.505 --> 00:13:58.665
I'll explain it to you later,

222
00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:01.185
Dude.

223
00:14:01.186 --> 00:14:02.554
Where'd you get those from?

224
00:14:02.555 --> 00:14:04.595
Remember earlier when we
were talking to Jeep? Yeah.


225
00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:47.444
It is time to see the world.
It's time to kiss some girls.


226
00:14:47.445 --> 00:14:50.864
Pastor Gula on two, easily. I'm a one

227
00:14:50.865 --> 00:14:53.714
Man band with no media playing, right?

228
00:14:53.715 --> 00:14:55.525
Tonight. I just need my guitar.

229
00:14:56.465 --> 00:14:57.885
You're one of our own down there.

230
00:14:58.905 --> 00:15:01.154
You never drink alone down there.

231
00:15:01.155 --> 00:15:03.085
Baab Breeze too Damn easy.

232
00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:09.205
- Bam. A what did you say
- The name of the song?


233
00:15:11.045 --> 00:15:15.055
Bama Breeze. LOL. 
It's Bama Breeze dude.

234
00:15:16.735 --> 00:15:19.924
- Bama Breeze.
- Yeah. Bama.


235
00:15:19.925 --> 00:15:22.065
We all know it was written about Obama.

236
00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:24.365
What are you talking about?

237
00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:27.674
Barack Obama, the 44th
president of the United States.


238
00:15:27.675 --> 00:15:28.675
Catch up.

239
00:15:31.085 --> 00:15:33.094
We know who Barack Obama is.

240
00:15:33.095 --> 00:15:36.465
Okay, question is, why do you
think that song is about him?


241
00:15:37.905 --> 00:15:41.044
I mean, everything.
First off, the title Bama,


242
00:15:41.045 --> 00:15:44.964
second Breeze, like a, you
know, tropical island breeze


243
00:15:44.965 --> 00:15:47.345
of which only someone
like JB can write about.


244
00:15:49.805 --> 00:15:51.384
And what state fits

245
00:15:51.385 --> 00:15:55.164
that description better
than Florida, Hawaii.


246
00:15:55.165 --> 00:15:58.825
And where was Obama from?
That's right. Huh? Vi e.


247
00:16:02.105 --> 00:16:04.094
It's a bit of a
stretch, don't you think?


248
00:16:04.095 --> 00:16:05.955
Let the ladies in
free with the fake id.

249
00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:09.914
It's textbook foreshadowing
about the whole


250
00:16:09.915 --> 00:16:11.235
birth certificate debacle.

251
00:16:14.075 --> 00:16:16.875
1984. Mick Jagger passed through town.

252
00:16:18.415 --> 00:16:20.635
We all know what
Obama was doing in 1984.

253
00:16:21.675 --> 00:16:23.764
Michelle. Shit.

254
00:16:23.765 --> 00:16:26.734
What? What the hell
does Obama have to do


255
00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:28.524
with the Birdman?

256
00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:29.744
Just get back to the damn

257
00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:30.804
Story.

258
00:16:30.805 --> 00:16:33.054
Says online that Jimmy Buffett never

259
00:16:33.055 --> 00:16:34.674
even wrote Bama Breeze.

260
00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:36.575
Ugh. What? This game's dumb.

261
00:16:39.255 --> 00:16:41.044
It's not enough. Hey, 
I'm getting boozed.

262
00:16:41.045 --> 00:16:44.704
You've been knocking back
triple since 6:00 AM You smell


263
00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:47.764
like hemmingway taint only half drunk.

264
00:16:47.765 --> 00:16:52.014
Not this again. Look,
I'm getting more booze.


265
00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:53.794
What do you guys want?

266
00:16:53.795 --> 00:16:55.485
Nowhere's gonna be open this late.

267
00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:59.364
- It's 11:00 AM
- Look. SUV his shack.


268
00:16:59.365 --> 00:17:01.034
There's definitely alcohol in there. Dude.

269
00:17:01.035 --> 00:17:04.664
Stop messing with Jeep.
That booze is all he is got.


270
00:17:04.665 --> 00:17:07.525
Ah, he'll survive. Survive.

271
00:17:08.715 --> 00:17:09.965
Yeah. Stay alive.

272
00:17:10.965 --> 00:17:13.394
- What about parrot heads?
- We're all parrot heads.


273
00:17:13.395 --> 00:17:16.804
- I'm not.
- It's just a stupid story.


274
00:17:16.805 --> 00:17:18.744
It's a stupid true story

275
00:17:18.745 --> 00:17:22.255
- About a parrot man,
- Para parrott head.


276
00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:25.014
- I don't follow.
- The story goes


277
00:17:25.015 --> 00:17:29.184
that there's this werewolf
like creature that turns into a


278
00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:34.094
Parrothead man and attacks
people who aren't big enough.


279
00:17:34.095 --> 00:17:36.495
Jimmy Buffett fans. 
It's, it's nonsense.

280
00:17:37.565 --> 00:17:39.935
What makes them turn the moon.

281
00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:42.435
You believe in the moon.

282
00:17:44.165 --> 00:17:48.615
Also, it's sobriety.

283
00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:52.245
- What if it's Jeep?
- Yeah.


284
00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:55.885
- Speaking of Jeep, I'm gonna
- At that booze


285
00:17:58.185 --> 00:17:59.185
Bar if, wait.

286
00:17:59.186 --> 00:18:01.194
Yeah. Mike is sober out there.

287
00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:02.195
Good looking out.

288
00:18:21.065 --> 00:18:23.245
- Oh no,
- Black.


289
00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:28.625
- Not again.
- Fuck.

00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:15.885
Oh, there we go. Finally

291
00:19:20.355 --> 00:19:21.355
Piss.

292
00:19:25.065 --> 00:19:26.185
It doesn't taste like piss

293
00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:34.675
Nice.

294
00:19:39.245 --> 00:19:42.504
I have been drunk now
for over two weeks. Shit.


295
00:19:42.505 --> 00:19:44.594
Old man. You scared the shit outta me.

296
00:19:44.595 --> 00:19:46.925
Well, oh, scratch that.

297
00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:53.365
Probably two decades. What? Here we are.

298
00:19:55.335 --> 00:19:57.925
Right on, man. I'm
gonna get outta here. No,


299
00:19:59.585 --> 00:20:02.365
See, I can tell

300
00:20:03.265 --> 00:20:04.725
you got a schoolboy heart.

301
00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:11.905
Now I need booze. 
And you got my 40.

302
00:20:12.305 --> 00:20:13.305
You gotta give it to me.

303
00:20:15.065 --> 00:20:17.485
I'm gonna, oh Jesus'. Psycho tcho.

304
00:20:25.855 --> 00:20:28.835
The contest starts tomorrow
night around seven.


305
00:20:29.795 --> 00:20:31.374
It's about a two hour drive.

306
00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:34.155
So we're gonna wanna leave about 6:00 AM

307
00:20:35.345 --> 00:20:36.325
What? Four.

308
00:20:36.326 --> 00:20:38.344
Gotta get a good spot. The tailgate.

309
00:20:38.345 --> 00:20:39.585
What happens at the tailgate?

310
00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:45.394
You'll love it. Everyone
hangs out drinking, playing.


311
00:20:45.395 --> 00:20:46.875
Buffet tunes in the parking lot.

312
00:20:48.945 --> 00:20:50.364
Let me just get this straight just

313
00:20:50.365 --> 00:20:52.174
so we're all in the same latitude here.

314
00:20:52.175 --> 00:20:54.344
We're going to a Jimmy
Buffett impersonator contest


315
00:20:54.345 --> 00:20:56.384
to listen to Jimmy Buffett music drink

316
00:20:56.385 --> 00:20:57.604
and listen to Jimmy Buffett

317
00:20:57.605 --> 00:20:58.994
impersonators sing those same songs.

318
00:20:58.995 --> 00:21:00.564
Only worse. But

319
00:21:00.565 --> 00:21:03.424
before all that, we're gonna
hang out in an asphalt parking


320
00:21:03.425 --> 00:21:05.524
lot, listening to the same exact music,

321
00:21:05.525 --> 00:21:07.125
with the same exact people and drinking.

322
00:21:07.945 --> 00:21:10.224
But before all that, we came
out to Jerry Jeff's camp


323
00:21:10.225 --> 00:21:11.885
to drink and listen to Buffett tunes.

324
00:21:13.185 --> 00:21:15.744
- That's about the size of it.
- Yeah,


325
00:21:15.745 --> 00:21:16.745
Sounds about right.

326
00:21:17.835 --> 00:21:19.114
What do you want on your burger?

327
00:21:19.115 --> 00:21:24.014
Lettuce. Tomatoes, Hans 57
fries. A pickle and a beer.


328
00:21:24.015 --> 00:21:26.165
- Let's stick the boat out.
- I'm driving.


329
00:21:28.275 --> 00:21:31.394
- Fuck you are.
- What?


330
00:21:31.395 --> 00:21:35.064
Your spastic ass flipped
the kayak in Key West


331
00:21:35.065 --> 00:21:38.184
and lost the keys to the rental car.

332
00:21:38.185 --> 00:21:40.724
Not to mention getting us lost at sea.

333
00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:44.804
Somehow after we already lost
the boat, we were stranded on


334
00:21:44.805 --> 00:21:47.514
that sandbar until monsoon season ended.

335
00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:49.544
That was you drinking with Qatar.

336
00:21:49.545 --> 00:21:51.944
And also, didn't we say we're
gonna talk about rape island?


337
00:21:51.945 --> 00:21:54.244
It would've been fine
if you hadn't invited


338
00:21:54.245 --> 00:21:56.644
that pirate Parker to
go drinking with us. He


339
00:21:56.645 --> 00:21:57.645
Saved us from drowning.

340
00:21:57.646 --> 00:22:00.244
It seemed appropriate. Not
to mention he rescued us from


341
00:22:00.245 --> 00:22:01.354
that uncontacted tribe.

342
00:22:01.355 --> 00:22:02.904
Yeah, the dude was facing four decades

343
00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:04.684
in a Haitian penitentiary.

344
00:22:04.685 --> 00:22:05.685
Remember any of that?

345
00:22:07.245 --> 00:22:08.524
Starting to feel like there's

346
00:22:08.525 --> 00:22:09.525
A lot of story.

347
00:22:09.526 --> 00:22:11.246
Of course I do. Story.
I remember all of it.


348
00:22:11.865 --> 00:22:15.485
That's the problem in my nightmares.

349
00:22:16.685 --> 00:22:18.564
I can still see all those gaunt,

350
00:22:18.565 --> 00:22:21.405
barefoot children standing
completely silent in the rain


351
00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:25.924
knee, deep in the waves,
just staring at us


352
00:22:25.925 --> 00:22:28.045
after we barely managed
to make it off shore.


353
00:22:29.215 --> 00:22:33.024
When I closed my eyes, I
could still see what they did


354
00:22:33.025 --> 00:22:34.504
to the Christian missionary we met there.

355
00:22:34.505 --> 00:22:35.505
Thaddeus,

356
00:22:37.325 --> 00:22:38.265
He was only there 'cause he

357
00:22:38.266 --> 00:22:39.506
wanted to deliver him presents.

358
00:22:40.205 --> 00:22:42.045
If only he'd been a little
quicker to the boat.


359
00:22:43.035 --> 00:22:44.345
Maybe we all made it off

360
00:22:46.575 --> 00:22:48.444
then maybe we could have
went convinced ourselves.


361
00:22:48.445 --> 00:22:52.105
We were simple children playing
simple children's games.


362
00:22:53.595 --> 00:22:55.795
Maybe I wouldn't have to wake
up for my sleep screaming.


363
00:22:57.905 --> 00:23:00.225
I really feel like we're
missing some major details here.


364
00:23:03.635 --> 00:23:05.604
Let's just say that
Key West was a long time


365
00:23:05.605 --> 00:23:06.625
ago and leave it at that.

366
00:23:10.805 --> 00:23:14.984
- But I loved her.
- I don't know


367
00:23:14.985 --> 00:23:17.284
what it is, but I get the feeling.

368
00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:19.625
I'm missing a lot of backstory here.

369
00:23:23.825 --> 00:23:26.106
I guess it's just one of
those times you had to be there


370
00:23:28.805 --> 00:23:29.805
To the boat.

371
00:23:34.375 --> 00:23:35.574
This is the boat, huh?

372
00:23:35.575 --> 00:23:37.774
Yeah. It's pretty dope, right?

373
00:23:37.775 --> 00:23:40.745
Yeah. If you mean dope as
in a shitty canoe in a lake.


374
00:23:42.325 --> 00:23:44.954
Alright, that was uncalled for Paris.

375
00:23:44.955 --> 00:23:45.885
- Can you check in that
- Cooler


376
00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:46.944
and make sure there's beer?

377
00:23:46.945 --> 00:23:47.945
Oh. Hmm.

378
00:23:50.565 --> 00:23:53.784
Hmm. What the hell's this?

379
00:23:53.785 --> 00:23:56.304
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Get her. Alright.


380
00:23:56.305 --> 00:23:58.214
That's my grandfather's spear gun. Let's

381
00:23:58.215 --> 00:24:00.594
Watch where you're
pointing. Let's try it out.


382
00:24:00.595 --> 00:24:05.124
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Because


383
00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:06.165
- This boat really
- Sucks.


384
00:24:11.305 --> 00:24:13.165
Get outta here. Four
doors. Family sedan.


385
00:24:29.515 --> 00:24:30.515
Stop

386
00:24:44.475 --> 00:24:45.475
Here.

387
00:24:45.476 --> 00:24:46.636
Lemme show you how it's done.

388
00:24:51.745 --> 00:24:53.115
This thing's fucking busted.

389
00:25:16.575 --> 00:25:18.544
- Ah.
- Oh


390
00:25:18.545 --> 00:25:20.635
Shit. Dani killed someone.

391
00:25:21.535 --> 00:25:24.414
- Oh, really?
- Okay.


392
00:25:24.415 --> 00:25:26.755
That's enough finger
pointing and spear pointing.


393
00:25:27.945 --> 00:25:32.085
How do y'all, I thought I
was all, all alone out here.


394
00:25:33.005 --> 00:25:34.045
I thought I was on my own.

395
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:36.554
Gareth, are you all right?

396
00:25:36.555 --> 00:25:40.384
Oh, spear thing. Yeah. 
Stings a little.

397
00:25:40.385 --> 00:25:44.254
Y'all didn't mean to impale me.
Y'all. Y'all are nice folks.


398
00:25:44.255 --> 00:25:47.785
I got so absorbed in my activities that

399
00:25:49.665 --> 00:25:53.324
I wasn't abreast of the,
the moment, the situation.


400
00:25:53.325 --> 00:25:54.664
That's gotta be the most vague

401
00:25:54.665 --> 00:25:57.354
and disconcerting answer I've ever heard.

402
00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:59.164
Thank you.

403
00:25:59.165 --> 00:26:02.154
What activities are you
doing up in the tree, Gareth?


404
00:26:02.155 --> 00:26:06.794
The normal regular ones
like bird peeping. You


405
00:26:06.795 --> 00:26:08.774
- Mean bird
- Watching?


406
00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:10.814
That's, that's the one.

407
00:26:10.815 --> 00:26:14.464
And just what kind of
birds are you looking for?


408
00:26:14.465 --> 00:26:18.734
There's a, a diverse local
group of, of tits and warblers


409
00:26:18.735 --> 00:26:21.704
and, and breasted, booby cocks that,

410
00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:25.494
that really make up the
local bird peeping scene.


411
00:26:25.495 --> 00:26:30.254
And man, I, I do enjoy a stare

412
00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.674
gander, if you will, at all the diverse

413
00:26:32.675 --> 00:26:33.835
wildlife we have around here.

414
00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:37.534
Didn't know we had any of
those birds around here. Oh,


415
00:26:37.535 --> 00:26:40.275
You gotta know where to
get the, the best views.


416
00:26:41.825 --> 00:26:45.044
Well, as fun and
educational as this has been,


417
00:26:45.045 --> 00:26:47.344
I think birdwatching hours are over.

418
00:26:47.345 --> 00:26:49.184
You need any help getting home, Gareth?

419
00:26:49.185 --> 00:26:50.954
Oh, I'll be fine on my own.

420
00:26:50.955 --> 00:26:52.684
This is not the first time I've been

421
00:26:52.685 --> 00:26:55.014
penetrated by an object.

422
00:26:55.015 --> 00:26:56.454
See ya, Gareth.

423
00:26:56.455 --> 00:26:59.515
Not if I see you first.
Y'all come back now. You here.


424
00:27:09.335 --> 00:27:14.024
So where to go? I think
I'm gonna go for a swim.


425
00:27:14.025 --> 00:27:15.635
Wash this drool off of me.

426
00:28:22.365 --> 00:28:25.145
Who could that be? What are
you doing here? Bird brain.


427
00:28:26.085 --> 00:28:27.085
Ah,

428
00:28:42.885 --> 00:28:44.694
Marvin, where the hell have you been?

429
00:28:44.695 --> 00:28:46.424
Dude, I got munched on

430
00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:47.865
by the housing challenge over there.

431
00:28:49.215 --> 00:28:50.465
Jeep. Yeah.

432
00:28:53.855 --> 00:28:55.415
I'm gonna, hold on. 
I'm gonna call him.

433
00:28:59.705 --> 00:29:03.125
I need a beer. Somebody
Gimme one. Oh, thanks buddy.


434
00:29:07.005 --> 00:29:10.775
It's not enough. 
It's never enough.

435
00:29:12.075 --> 00:29:16.724
You all right dude? Yeah, yeah.

436
00:29:16.725 --> 00:29:18.124
I just, I just
need to soak her up.

437
00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:20.645
You know, I'm gonna grab,
I'm gonna take a piss.


438
00:29:23.735 --> 00:29:25.554
All right. Jeep's not picking up,

439
00:29:25.555 --> 00:29:28.414
so I'm gonna go
down and talk to him.

440
00:29:28.415 --> 00:29:32.364
He can't be doing this.
We, we talked about this.


441
00:29:32.365 --> 00:29:33.424
Lemme back in a second, guys.

442
00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:34.425
I'll come with you.

443
00:30:04.655 --> 00:30:09.634
So you wanna play
parts? Cheesy? Jeep. Jeep.


444
00:30:09.635 --> 00:30:14.635
Oh, but up, man. Come on.
Are you come? Oh shit.


445
00:30:14.905 --> 00:30:19.034
- Let's just go.
- We can't go. He can't, he can't do this.


446
00:30:19.035 --> 00:30:20.894
He can't, he can't just bite people.

447
00:30:20.895 --> 00:30:22.055
I told him six times already.

448
00:30:23.005 --> 00:30:24.415
- He's
- Bitten six people before.


449
00:30:26.515 --> 00:30:28.444
No, but I told
him not to six times.

450
00:30:28.445 --> 00:30:30.575
There's gotta be a spare
key around here somewhere.


451
00:30:35.485 --> 00:30:39.055
Jeep. All right, well, let's see.

452
00:30:40.725 --> 00:30:42.094
Jeep, are you in here?

453
00:30:42.095 --> 00:30:44.514
I, I don't mean to
impede on your domicile,


454
00:30:44.515 --> 00:30:46.154
but we need to talk.

455
00:30:46.155 --> 00:30:50.204
Oh my God. You should not

456
00:30:50.205 --> 00:30:51.725
live in a place that smells like this.

457
00:30:53.135 --> 00:30:54.644
A person lives here.

458
00:30:54.645 --> 00:30:58.204
Yeah. You could call 'em that, huh?

459
00:30:58.205 --> 00:30:59.815
This is, this is unsettling.

460
00:31:01.215 --> 00:31:02.504
I don't have a good feeling about this.

461
00:31:02.505 --> 00:31:04.655
Let's, yeah, let's, yeah,
let's just get outta here.


462
00:31:05.525 --> 00:31:07.535
Holy shit. Jeep,

463
00:31:08.905 --> 00:31:12.535
After all these years of
boozing, I always blamed her.


464
00:31:14.155 --> 00:31:15.655
And now I've come to realization.

465
00:31:18.955 --> 00:31:20.095
That's my own damn fault.

466
00:31:21.155 --> 00:31:23.194
You know what? Stop
the car. Stop the car.


467
00:31:23.195 --> 00:31:27.975
You're, you're driving. Not anymore.

468
00:32:10.745 --> 00:32:11.925
It is my own damn fault.

469
00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:23.575
What? You never had a
man die on top of you.


470
00:32:27.105 --> 00:32:28.105
What?

471
00:32:33.595 --> 00:32:35.074
30 years of boozing.

472
00:32:35.075 --> 00:32:37.055
The cumulative hangover
finally did him in.


473
00:32:40.745 --> 00:32:43.815
Let's, let's just go back to
the camp and call the police.


474
00:32:47.995 --> 00:32:49.175
Marvin, you okay in there?

475
00:32:58.035 --> 00:33:00.535
Is he okay? How
would I know that? Dude?

476
00:33:04.405 --> 00:33:06.055
Just don't choke on your own. Vomit.

477
00:33:17.275 --> 00:33:18.275
He is gone.

478
00:33:23.005 --> 00:33:24.724
All right. I, I
got you. I got you.

479
00:33:24.725 --> 00:33:27.584
It was a second store window
he jumped out of. I got you.


480
00:33:27.585 --> 00:33:28.585
Keep going.

481
00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:39.124
Go for Peterson. Oh,
you're here? Yeah. Great.


482
00:33:39.125 --> 00:33:41.174
No, just come around to the back.

483
00:33:41.175 --> 00:33:44.384
I'll be in the Jacos
taking a soak. No, no, no.


484
00:33:44.385 --> 00:33:46.684
I'll take care of the
Uber. Don't worry about it.


485
00:33:46.685 --> 00:33:47.785
See you soon. Sweet cheeks.

486
00:33:58.135 --> 00:34:02.825
Mohamed. One star. 
That's for nine 11.

487
00:34:12.125 --> 00:34:14.505
Oh yeah. Come on in, baby.
Pour yourself a drink.


488
00:34:36.415 --> 00:34:38.935
Well, Jeep's dead.

489
00:34:40.185 --> 00:34:42.404
- You kill him.
- What?


490
00:34:44.194 --> 00:34:47.184
- Right on.
- Marvin's gone too.


491
00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:49.224
Where the hell is Marvin Gardens?

492
00:34:49.225 --> 00:34:50.443
Why'd you just use his full name?

493
00:34:50.444 --> 00:34:52.713
He's probably dead in a ditch somewhere.

494
00:34:52.714 --> 00:34:54.474
Oh, he's such an asshole.

495
00:34:54.475 --> 00:34:55.755
But we still look for him. No,

496
00:35:02.035 --> 00:35:03.035
No.

497
00:35:03.036 --> 00:35:04.676
Delaney's. Right. 
We need to go find him.

498
00:35:20.475 --> 00:35:22.064
Marvin.

499
00:35:22.065 --> 00:35:26.515
Hello Marvin.

500
00:35:28.015 --> 00:35:30.075
God so hot out here. Yeah, I know.

501
00:35:32.035 --> 00:35:34.635
I just wanna take off some
of your clothing, huh? Look,


502
00:35:38.935 --> 00:35:40.265
It's definitely bird poopy.

503
00:35:42.925 --> 00:35:43.925
It's definitely fresh.

504
00:35:48.345 --> 00:35:51.044
Looks like there was more
to that story after all.


505
00:35:51.045 --> 00:35:52.455
What? The story of e coli?

506
00:35:53.395 --> 00:35:57.004
No. Story of the bird. 
Big damn bird.

507
00:35:57.005 --> 00:35:58.334
What are you saying?
There's a parrot man in the


508
00:35:58.335 --> 00:35:59.594
woods. And he ate Marvin. No,

509
00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:00.775
Not a parrot man.

510
00:36:01.765 --> 00:36:05.615
A parrot head. I'll ask
Marvin. I knew the, well


511
00:36:06.585 --> 00:36:07.585
You just met him.

512
00:36:08.515 --> 00:36:10.855
- It's Hamlet.
- His name's Marvin.


513
00:36:11.985 --> 00:36:16.224
- Nevermind.
- This can't be Marvin.


514
00:36:16.225 --> 00:36:18.074
Marvin had six toes.

515
00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:20.004
- What are you saying?
- This can't be Marvin.


516
00:36:20.005 --> 00:36:21.824
Marvin had six toes.

517
00:36:21.825 --> 00:36:23.205
No, I mean, what does that mean?

518
00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:26.954
That the Birdman ate
someone else, not Marvin.


519
00:36:26.955 --> 00:36:28.415
Who knows how many someone else is.

520
00:36:29.595 --> 00:36:32.564
We need to get the others
and get out of here. Let's go.


521
00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:33.775
Alright, so wait a second.

522
00:36:35.165 --> 00:36:38.305
Why didn't Jerry, Jeff and Paris
go looking for 'em too? You


523
00:36:47.745 --> 00:36:48.745
Wanna go have sex?

524
00:36:50.085 --> 00:36:53.115
What? Like together? Yeah.

525
00:36:54.435 --> 00:36:56.815
We just found a dead guy.

526
00:37:03.275 --> 00:37:04.965
Yeah, but we really didn't know him.

527
00:37:08.215 --> 00:37:10.844
- Still a dead guy.
- But I didn't have sex.


528
00:37:10.845 --> 00:37:12.624
Every time I found a dead body,

529
00:37:12.625 --> 00:37:14.514
I'd probably still be a virgin.

530
00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:19.515
Well that, yeah.

531
00:37:19.815 --> 00:37:21.715
I'm gonna call the cops first.

532
00:37:23.835 --> 00:37:25.555
Suit yourself. I'm
gonna go take a shower.


533
00:37:26.955 --> 00:37:28.715
I'm sure you washed
the cadaver off of you.


534
00:38:16.755 --> 00:38:17.755
Representative

535
00:38:26.825 --> 00:38:27.765
Paris.

536
00:38:27.766 --> 00:38:30.615
- Yeah,
- Paris. This isn't funny.


537
00:38:32.795 --> 00:38:34.615
You know I have that thing about chickens.

538
00:38:40.255 --> 00:38:41.255
Paris,

539
00:38:46.175 --> 00:38:47.175
Paris.

540
00:40:34.185 --> 00:40:37.244
Put some clothes on. We
need to go. Why the concert's?


541
00:40:37.245 --> 00:40:39.354
Not until tomorrow. 'cause
parent head's real. What?


542
00:40:39.355 --> 00:40:41.645
Where's Jerry? Jeff, would
you please put on a shirt?


543
00:40:42.545 --> 00:40:44.504
No shirt, no shoes. No problem.

544
00:40:44.505 --> 00:40:46.534
That's not even a Buffet song.

545
00:40:46.535 --> 00:40:48.485
These references have
gotten out of control.


546
00:40:51.085 --> 00:40:54.165
I need some fruitcake.
She wants a fruitcake.


547
00:41:27.295 --> 00:41:28.515
Go faster. I'm,

548
00:42:10.665 --> 00:42:11.665
He is on the roof.

549
00:42:18.155 --> 00:42:20.344
- What
- The, why would you bear arms?


550
00:42:20.345 --> 00:42:21.605
I'm not in.

551
00:42:37.275 --> 00:42:41.194
Hold it. Hold it. So
Paris falls to the ground


552
00:42:41.195 --> 00:42:45.404
with the parrot headed
man and Delaney and Bob.


553
00:42:45.405 --> 00:42:49.805
Just leave her there. That
is some fucked up shit.


554
00:42:53.305 --> 00:42:54.525
That's it. That's it.

555
00:43:25.415 --> 00:43:27.054
Shit.

556
00:43:27.055 --> 00:43:29.064
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I

557
00:43:29.065 --> 00:43:30.185
thought Delaney was driving.

558
00:43:31.405 --> 00:43:32.405
I'm driving

559
00:43:38.935 --> 00:43:39.935
shit.

560
00:43:40.975 --> 00:43:42.025
- Turn around.
- What?


561
00:43:42.895 --> 00:43:44.414
Turn the car around.

562
00:43:44.415 --> 00:43:46.464
There's a Parrothead man
back there registering a


563
00:43:46.465 --> 00:43:48.044
beach blanket up my eyes.

564
00:43:48.045 --> 00:43:50.264
No thank you. There's gotta be another way

565
00:43:50.265 --> 00:43:52.705
out. Where are you going?

566
00:43:53.565 --> 00:43:55.804
I'm through running. I've
been running from parrot heads


567
00:43:55.805 --> 00:43:57.564
in Buffet my entire life.

568
00:43:57.565 --> 00:44:01.084
- But why?
- Back in 83,


569
00:44:01.085 --> 00:44:03.084
my mom was in Maryville, Indiana.

570
00:44:03.085 --> 00:44:05.524
It was the one particular Harbor tour.

571
00:44:05.525 --> 00:44:08.865
She was in the second row
of the holiday star theater.


572
00:44:10.445 --> 00:44:11.755
Jimmy Buffett saw my mom

573
00:44:12.855 --> 00:44:14.795
and he invited her
backstage after the show.


574
00:44:15.825 --> 00:44:19.304
Oh shit. Your dad's Jimmy Buffett. What?

575
00:44:19.305 --> 00:44:21.264
No. No.

576
00:44:21.265 --> 00:44:24.044
One of the fans backstage
spilled a margarita


577
00:44:24.045 --> 00:44:25.205
all over her brand new dress.

578
00:44:26.565 --> 00:44:27.925
Couldn't get that stain out.

579
00:44:29.185 --> 00:44:32.765
She raised me to hate
him, but dammit, I can't.


580
00:44:33.675 --> 00:44:35.704
I've heard the call of the Mother Ocean

581
00:44:35.705 --> 00:44:37.685
and I have to take the
fight to Parrothead.


582
00:44:39.035 --> 00:44:40.035
Good luck, Rob.

583
00:44:40.985 --> 00:44:44.414
- My name's Bob.
- I


584
00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:45.415
It's fine.

585
00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:46.696
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

586
00:44:48.015 --> 00:44:50.224
Just, you know, 'cause
everything going on, I,


587
00:44:50.225 --> 00:44:52.454
I said it's fine. It's cool.

588
00:44:52.455 --> 00:44:53.705
Yeah, already then

589
00:45:03.435 --> 00:45:04.585
Think I can ram 'em

590
00:45:10.285 --> 00:45:11.285
So long.

591
00:45:11.286 --> 00:45:12.774
Bert,

592
00:45:12.775 --> 00:45:14.054
It's Bob.

593
00:45:14.055 --> 00:45:15.055
It's three letters.

594
00:45:17.935 --> 00:45:18.935
- Para
- Ahead


595
00:45:22.645 --> 00:45:25.545
Off to see the Lizard's best album.

596
00:48:02.665 --> 00:48:04.305
All right, so let me get this straight.

597
00:48:05.305 --> 00:48:07.564
You and a bunch of your friends went

598
00:48:07.565 --> 00:48:11.464
and stole a bunch of alcohol
from some old alcohol dude


599
00:48:11.465 --> 00:48:14.504
who then bit you

600
00:48:14.505 --> 00:48:16.845
and look, I ain't judging
my, my cousin's gay.


601
00:48:18.025 --> 00:48:21.645
But then you turned into
a Parrothead monster


602
00:48:22.585 --> 00:48:26.725
and then you went and
killed all your friends.


603
00:48:28.185 --> 00:48:32.104
And then you got attacked by
some show tune singing shark.


604
00:48:32.105 --> 00:48:33.105
Is that right?

605
00:48:34.055 --> 00:48:36.225
Yeah, that's pretty
much the whole story.


606
00:48:37.175 --> 00:48:41.825
Yeah. So riddle me this K
Sabi. Why ain't you a bird now?


607
00:48:42.705 --> 00:48:46.875
Because I'm drunk. Only turned
into a bird when I'm sober.


608
00:48:47.995 --> 00:48:51.934
I see. So we pick you up
from behind the seven 11


609
00:48:51.935 --> 00:48:54.454
for stealing a bunch of land shark

610
00:48:54.455 --> 00:48:57.814
and now you're confessing
to a quadruple murder.


611
00:48:57.815 --> 00:48:58.815
Is that right?

612
00:48:59.995 --> 00:49:02.095
Yes. Hey, can I get a beer?

613
00:49:04.405 --> 00:49:08.764
No. No you could not. Come on.

614
00:49:08.765 --> 00:49:12.464
- Where are we going?
- The crime scene bird shit.


615
00:49:12.465 --> 00:49:15.065
Oh, I'm really gonna
need up here before that.


616
00:49:16.465 --> 00:49:20.265
- Absolutely not.
- Hey, I'm getting sober.


617
00:49:21.225 --> 00:49:24.144
I don't like me when I'm sober. Get

618
00:49:24.145 --> 00:49:26.394
Your ass in the car, bird Shit.

619
00:49:26.395 --> 00:49:27.395
Let's go

620
00:49:48.775 --> 00:49:50.324
Stay in the car. Bird shit.

621
00:49:50.325 --> 00:49:52.044
No, no, no, no. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait,


622
00:49:52.045 --> 00:49:53.045
Bro.

623
00:49:53.046 --> 00:49:56.865
No, wait, wait, wait. Bojo,
Buddo, Bojo. Beer Bojo here.


624
00:49:58.165 --> 00:49:59.385
Ah shit. It's gone.

625
00:50:36.915 --> 00:50:38.445
Well. Well, well Bird Brain

626
00:50:39.375 --> 00:50:41.805
looks like we got a little
bit more to store to tip.


627
00:51:03.665 --> 00:51:08.544
It is a quarter to five
as a take a dive into drink.


628
00:51:08.545 --> 00:51:09.605
Number four.

629
00:51:12.865 --> 00:51:17.364
The El drunk sitting next
to me share something


630
00:51:17.365 --> 00:51:18.365
I couldn't ignore.

631
00:51:21.385 --> 00:51:24.934
He said, son, you
know I've seen it all

632
00:51:24.935 --> 00:51:29.935
while I've got you sitting
here for your own good.


633
00:51:30.525 --> 00:51:34.285
I hope you would hear this
old man's greatest fear.


634
00:51:37.705 --> 00:51:40.384
I'm not afraid of sharks

635
00:51:40.385 --> 00:51:43.125
or some big old hurricane,

636
00:51:44.665 --> 00:51:49.104
but really keeps me up
at night is the thought


637
00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:50.605
of sober brain.

638
00:51:54.025 --> 00:51:57.504
All these years of drinking of cow,

639
00:51:57.505 --> 00:51:59.445
the other deems away.

640
00:52:02.395 --> 00:52:05.944
It's anxiety of sobriety.

641
00:52:05.945 --> 00:52:08.485
Now could you buy me some Bombay?

642
00:52:11.385 --> 00:52:14.744
Yes. Anxiety of sobriety.

643
00:52:14.745 --> 00:52:16.805
I'm gonna need some damn bomb.

644
00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.564
Plus had some Harmon as a baseline.

645
00:52:26.565 --> 00:52:28.304
Maybe a little progression
in the background.


646
00:52:28.305 --> 00:52:30.194
But yeah, that's basically it

647
00:52:30.195 --> 00:52:32.394
From the number one station.

648
00:52:32.395 --> 00:52:35.805
This is the story about
love. A love story.


649
00:52:44.735 --> 00:52:45.595

650

From the tree.

660

Do you believe in the moon?
