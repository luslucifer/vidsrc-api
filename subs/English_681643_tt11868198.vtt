What's your point of view?

158
00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:21.152
- What are you coming in with?

159
00:31:23.355 --> 00:31:25.321
- I mean...

160
00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:34.066
Like, self-loathing,
self-hate, um...


161
00:31:37.336 --> 00:31:41.238
No? No?

162
00:31:41.307 --> 00:31:44.076
- Self-hate...

163
00:31:44.145 --> 00:31:46.507
needs to be fuller.

164
00:31:54.122 --> 00:31:57.452
It's a mother-daughter
story moment.


165
00:32:02.196 --> 00:32:05.394
I know you understand that.

166
00:32:08.367 --> 00:32:10.069
I know you do.

167
00:32:12.074 --> 00:32:15.668
You're just
not connected to it.


168
00:32:15.737 --> 00:32:19.342
- Yeah, I thought I was.
- Mm-mm.


169
00:32:19.411 --> 00:32:22.213
These aren't your words.

170
00:32:24.317 --> 00:32:28.285
The words must be
like gasoline.


171
00:32:29.751 --> 00:32:34.258
Say it like it will
set you on fire.


172
00:32:34.327 --> 00:32:36.557
Say it like you have shit

173
00:32:36.626 --> 00:32:39.967
in your mouth.

174
00:32:43.204 --> 00:32:45.665
Do you understand?

175
00:32:45.734 --> 00:32:48.635
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:32:48.704 --> 00:32:50.406
Mm-hmm.

177
00:32:53.115 --> 00:32:55.081
Yeah, I think--
I think so.


178
00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:57.248
- Don't think.

179
00:32:59.385 --> 00:33:01.252
Do.

00:35:28.963 --> 00:35:32.535
Yeah, no,
it felt a little off, right?

- I mean, it's not how
I would play it,

I just thought that,
you know, this is a difficult--


203
00:35:51.557 --> 00:35:52.589
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:35:52.658 --> 00:35:54.722
- A difficult conversation
for her to have,


205
00:35:54.791 --> 00:35:58.363
and, you know, it's--it's hard
for her to talk about,


206
00:35:58.432 --> 00:35:59.826
so I didn't want to go crazy.

207
00:35:59.895 --> 00:36:01.333
- I know.

208

- And I mean,
it's--it's--


209
00:36:04.834 --> 00:36:05.833
Her mom is trying to kill her,

210
00:36:05.902 --> 00:36:08.340
but in the end,
she has to kill her mom.


211
00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:12.476
I mean, that's...

212
00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:14.610
It's horrible.

213
00:37:01.363 --> 00:37:05.463
- They have you reading
for the sister now?


214
00:37:05.532 --> 00:37:08.334
- Yep.

215
00:37:12.902 --> 00:37:15.374

216
00:37:15.443 --> 00:37:17.508
- Everything's fine.

- Uh...

220
00:37:34.528 --> 00:37:38.859
Soldiers,
when they get back from war,


221
00:37:38.928 --> 00:37:43.094
then they have PTSD.

222
00:37:43.163 --> 00:37:46.372
You ever wonder why?

223
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:48.000
Because there's no time
for feeling


224
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:51.773
when all you're trying to do
is not get shot.

You are dark-skinned...

Black woman in America.

227
00:37:59.817 --> 00:38:01.750
Just right out of the gate,
you're at war,

00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:08.427
- Are you saying
I have PTSD?


230
00:38:08.496 --> 00:38:12.123
- I'm saying for you
to get to this point,


231
00:38:12.192 --> 00:38:17.128
you've overcome real pain.

232
00:38:17.197 --> 00:38:21.869
But overcoming and dealing
is not the same thing.


233
00:38:30.551 --> 00:38:33.144
When was the last time

234
00:38:33.213 --> 00:38:35.916
you spoke to your mom?

235
00:38:35.985 --> 00:38:38.457

your look,
it will get you into the room,

but your ability
to reveal yourself,

Don't.

You are fine.

280
00:43:25.981 --> 00:43:27.680
This has nothing to do
with you personally.


281
00:43:27.749 --> 00:43:29.374
This is not about
your sense of self


282
00:43:29.443 --> 00:43:31.409
or your being
or your worth, even.


283
00:43:31.478 --> 00:43:34.885
You just need to live
in the--look!


284

I am not your mother.

286

The director

287

Do not get us confused.

292
00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:12.252
Have you thought

293

What Jehovah has
for us...


297

is forever.

298
00:44:44.826 --> 00:44:46.484
- Stop it.
- Mm-mm.


299
00:44:46.553 --> 00:44:47.719
I'm not gonna argue
with you, Mona.


300
00:44:47.788 --> 00:44:51.027
- Me neither.
- We have a meeting tonight.


301
00:44:51.096 --> 00:44:55.834
I am going to get prepared.
You are going to get ready.


302
00:45:03.438 --> 00:45:06.108
Come with me, Mona.

303
00:45:07.343 --> 00:45:09.111
- Right.

304
00:45:10.412 --> 00:45:11.778
Because God forbid

305
00:45:11.847 --> 00:45:14.314
something conflicts with your
fucking meeting, right?


306
00:45:14.383 --> 00:45:16.052
- Okay, we're not gonna have
that type of language


307
00:45:16.121 --> 00:45:17.790
in my house.
- What, what's the problem?


308
00:45:17.859 --> 00:45:19.220
Yes, Mom, I curse now!

309
00:45:19.289 --> 00:45:20.793
- Oh, and how does that
make you feel?


310
00:45:20.862 --> 00:45:22.553
- Great.
I am proud of it, yeah.


311
00:45:22.622 --> 00:45:26.931
I am so proud, and I am done
trying to make you proud of me.


312
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.328
- And how does that
make you feel?


313
00:45:28.397 --> 00:45:29.529
- Oh, it's great.

314
00:45:29.598 --> 00:45:30.664
- Is it great?
- I'm a working actor now.


315
00:45:30.733 --> 00:45:34.070
- Oh, mm-hmm.

single mothers,


469
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:34.742
the out-of-wedlock birth rate
among Black people in America


470
00:54:34.811 --> 00:54:36.975
was at 20%
and that now it's at 70%?


471
00:54:37.044 --> 00:54:39.681
- Where do you get this shit?
- I do talk to him about that.


472
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.419
- You talk--you talk
about out-of-wedlock birth


473
00:54:41.488 --> 00:54:42.717
with your ten-year-old?

474
00:54:42.786 --> 00:54:43.952
- I don't have to
defend myself.


475
00:54:44.021 --> 00:54:46.523
I don't have a problem
with anyone, gay, Black.


476
00:54:46.592 --> 00:54:49.020
I named my dog Mariah Carey
because I love Mariah Carey,


477
00:54:49.089 --> 00:54:51.627
and I'm pretty sure my dog
is gay, and I love my dog.


478
00:54:51.696 --> 00:54:54.795
What I have a problem with
is everyone telling me


479
00:54:54.864 --> 00:54:56.863
how bad my son is, everything
that's wrong with him.


480
00:54:56.932 --> 00:54:58.799
- He's just--

481
00:54:58.868 --> 00:55:02.066
he's hearing different things
in here and out there,


482
00:55:02.135 --> 00:55:04.871
and--and that's clearly
confusing him.


483
00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:05.972
That's causing him to lash out,

484
00:55:06.041 --> 00:55:07.574
and--and that's alienating him
from people.


485
00:55:07.643 --> 00:55:10.910
- It is not my fault that right
now we're living in this moment


486
00:55:10.979 --> 00:55:15.387
of groupthink social justice
fucking warrior mob nonsense.


487
00:55:15.456 --> 00:55:16.689
- Groupthink?

488
00:55:16.757 --> 00:55:18.049
- And that that's what
the school is teaching.


489
00:55:18.118 --> 00:55:19.217
That is not my fault.

490
00:55:19.286 --> 00:55:21.151
- So he was suspended
from school for two days


491
00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.352
because of groupthink?

492
00:55:24.531 --> 00:55:26.024
- Why do you have empathy
for everyone in the world


493
00:55:26.093 --> 00:55:28.961
except for me?

494
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.733
- Why do you care what I think?

495
00:55:31.802 --> 00:55:33.867
- Do you hate me?

496
00:55:33.936 --> 00:55:35.737
- Why would you say that?

497
00:55:46.179 --> 00:55:47.980
- If you think you have
all the answers,


498
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:49.146
why don't you go talk to him?

499
00:55:49.215 --> 00:55:50.214
He's upstairs.

500
00:55:54.528 --> 00:55:57.429
Just try to keep your agenda
out of it, okay?


501
00:55:57.498 --> 00:56:01.092
Just try to make it about him?

502
00:56:04.065 --> 00:56:05.701
- I just landed in a ship,

503
00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:07.103
and this guy
was, like, a snowman.


504
00:56:07.171 --> 00:56:08.935
There's another one.
See, that's what it looks like.


505
00:56:09.004 --> 00:56:10.134
And then--oh, that one.

506
00:56:10.203 --> 00:56:13.005
Great, yes.

507
00:56:13.074 --> 00:56:14.173
Too close, too close.

508
00:56:14.242 --> 00:56:17.977
There's a guy up there.
There's a guy.


509
00:56:18.046 --> 00:56:20.881
Hey, are you a pescatarian?

510
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:23.048
- I am.

511
00:56:23.117 --> 00:56:25.655
- Why?

512
00:56:25.724 --> 00:56:27.855
- I just don't like
to eat meat.


513
00:56:31.257 --> 00:56:33.190
- How come you don't have
a girlfriend?


514
00:56:36.702 --> 00:56:38.932
My mom says it's because
you don't have a job.


515
00:56:39.001 --> 00:56:42.067
I think it's because
you're better than everyone.


516
00:56:42.136 --> 00:56:43.838
- You're a good kid, Jared.

517
00:56:43.907 --> 00:56:48.172
- That's not what my English
teacher says.


518
00:56:48.241 --> 00:56:49.811
- Yeah?

519
00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.748
What does
your English teacher say?


520
00:56:52.817 --> 00:56:55.949
- My English teacher's
just terrible.


521
00:56:56.018 --> 00:56:57.885
- Why--why is your
English teacher terrible?


522
00:56:57.954 --> 00:56:59.920
- Just...

523
00:56:59.989 --> 00:57:03.121
He's inappropriate,
very inappropriate.


524
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:07.532
- In what way?
- The way he acts.


525
00:57:07.601 --> 00:57:09.633
- How's he act?
- He talks.


526
00:57:09.702 --> 00:57:12.867
Like, it's weird--
whoa, whoa.


527
00:57:12.936 --> 00:57:17.608
- What--what's weird
about the way he talks?


528
00:57:17.677 --> 00:57:19.874
- He's, like, really gay.

529
00:57:21.714 --> 00:57:24.010
Go, go.
- Oh.


530
00:57:24.079 --> 00:57:26.914
- He sits with his,
like, legs crossed.


531
00:57:26.983 --> 00:57:31.182
Oh!
- I-I see.


532
00:57:31.251 --> 00:57:34.856
- Why's he have
to act like that?


533
00:57:34.925 --> 00:57:36.792
- Um...

534
00:57:36.861 --> 00:57:40.059
- Why does he have to stick
that in our faces? Gross.


535
00:57:40.128 --> 00:57:43.634
Also, he's, like, Black, so
it's, you know, even weirder.


536
00:57:43.703 --> 00:57:45.669
- Hey.

537
00:57:45.738 --> 00:57:49.002
- Zone, zone, zone.
Zone, zone, zone!


538
00:57:49.071 --> 00:57:51.070
- Hey, Jared--
- Behind these trees--


539
00:57:51.139 --> 00:57:52.544
- Jared.
- What?


540
00:57:52.613 --> 00:57:53.776
- It's okay.
- Where'd he go?


541
00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:56.944
You can talk to me.

542
00:57:57.013 --> 00:57:58.781
He sent me
to the principal's office.


543
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:00.882
- Why'd he send you
to the principal's office?


544
00:58:00.951 --> 00:58:03.148
- He hates me.

545
00:58:03.217 --> 00:58:05.953
Everyone at school hates me.

546
00:58:06.022 --> 00:58:08.923
- Why don't--
- I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.


547
00:58:08.992 --> 00:58:10.694
- Why don't you tell me
what happened?


548
00:58:10.763 --> 00:58:11.996
- I don't really remember.

549
00:58:12.064 --> 00:58:16.293
- Jared, what did you do?
- I didn't do anything.


550
00:58:16.362 --> 00:58:17.833
- How do you know you
didn't do anything--


551
00:58:17.902 --> 00:58:18.834
How do you know
you didn't do anything


552
00:58:18.903 --> 00:58:20.102
if you don't remember
what happened?


553
00:58:20.171 --> 00:58:22.574
- Oh, someone's there!
Someone's there! Yes!


554
00:58:22.643 --> 00:58:23.876
- All right, all right, Jared.
- Eliminated.


555
00:58:23.944 --> 00:58:25.610
There's another guy behind me.
There's another guy.


556
00:58:25.679 --> 00:58:28.074
- Jared, look at me.

557
00:58:28.143 --> 00:58:31.011
- Don't hate me, Gabe.

558
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.948
- Lunch is ready.

559
00:58:34.017 --> 00:58:36.654
- No!
He was right behind me.


560
00:58:36.723 --> 00:58:40.086
Mom, he was right behind me.
I could have killed him!


561
00:58:40.155 --> 00:58:42.088
I could have killed him!

562
00:59:01.913 --> 00:59:04.308
- So, Gabe,
what's new with you?


563
00:59:04.377 --> 00:59:07.751
- I'm making a documentary.

564
00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.051
- What about?
- Police brutality.


565
00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:13.086
- Oh, boy.

566
00:59:16.191 --> 00:59:17.357
Easy, now.

567
00:59:17.426 --> 00:59:20.357
Can we maybe not talk
about politics for once?


568
00:59:20.426 --> 00:59:22.260
- Actually meeting
a regional organizer


569
00:59:22.329 --> 00:59:23.965
for Black Lives Matter
tomorrow.


570
00:59:24.034 --> 00:59:26.000
- Oh.

571
00:59:27.466 --> 00:59:30.037
- How's that feel?

572
00:59:30.106 --> 00:59:31.874
- How's what feel?

573
00:59:31.943 --> 00:59:33.403
- Being
a cultural appropriator.


574
00:59:33.472 --> 00:59:35.339
Touché.

575
00:59:35.408 --> 00:59:36.945
- See, this is what
your side loves to do.


576
00:59:37.014 --> 00:59:38.276
You avoid dealing
with the message


577
00:59:38.345 --> 00:59:39.477
by bullying the messenger.

578
00:59:39.546 --> 00:59:41.411
- Black Lives Matter
is a racist message.


579
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.746
- All lives matter.

580
00:59:42.815 --> 00:59:44.183
- Yeah, Gabe, why don't you
make a movie about that?


581
00:59:44.252 --> 00:59:45.954
Mariah Carey, no.

582
00:59:46.023 --> 00:59:48.759
- Can I make that one?
- Yeah, might as well.


583
00:59:48.828 --> 00:59:50.662
It's just so adversarial,

584
00:59:50.731 --> 00:59:52.763
as if our lives don't matter.

585
00:59:52.832 --> 00:59:54.996
Hey, hey, hey!
- Down!


586
00:59:55.065 --> 00:59:57.768
Mariah Carey.
Mariah Carey, down, down.


587
00:59:57.837 --> 00:59:59.737
- No one's saying your life
doesn't matter, David.


588
00:59:59.806 --> 01:00:01.039
- It's just bad marketing.

589
01:00:01.107 --> 01:00:03.675
- Unarmed innocent people
keep getting killed by cops,


590
01:00:03.744 --> 01:00:04.910
and you're talking
about marketing.


591
01:00:04.979 --> 01:00:07.239
- Who's innocent?
- Oscar Grant was innocent.


592
01:00:07.308 --> 01:00:08.307
- Oscar Grant had a record,

593
01:00:08.376 --> 01:00:09.508
illegal possession
of a handgun.


594
01:00:09.577 --> 01:00:11.076
Don't tell me
these people are innocent.


595
01:00:11.145 --> 01:00:14.015
- He was shot in the back lying
facedown on a subway platform.


596
01:00:14.084 --> 01:00:16.721
- It was a freak accident.
- Except it keeps happening.


597
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:18.085
Trayvon Martin was also
a freak accident?


598
01:00:18.154 --> 01:00:19.520
- Trayvon Martin
wasn't killed by a cop.


599
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:22.826
He was killed by an idiot.
- Tamir Rice, Eric Garner--


600
01:00:22.895 --> 01:00:23.894
- Eric Garner is dead
because he was selling


601
01:00:23.963 --> 01:00:26.357
untaxed cigarettes
and resisting arrest.


602
01:00:26.426 --> 01:00:27.897
The guy was the size
of a Mack truck.


603
01:00:27.966 --> 01:00:29.800
It took five cops
to restrain him.


604
01:00:29.869 --> 01:00:31.102
How could anyone know
that he had asthma?


605
01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:33.705
- Because he was screaming,
"I can't breathe."


606
01:00:33.774 --> 01:00:35.073
- See,
even the marketing there,


607
01:00:35.142 --> 01:00:37.808
the "I can't breathe" shirts,
it's just so accusatory,


608
01:00:37.877 --> 01:00:39.009
pointing a finger at me

609
01:00:39.078 --> 01:00:40.712
as if I was the one
who was choking him.


610
01:00:40.781 --> 01:00:41.680
- You keep--
- Down.


611
01:00:41.749 --> 01:00:43.847
- You keep talking
about marketing.


612
01:00:43.916 --> 01:00:45.315
- Well, because it is marketing

613
01:00:45.384 --> 01:00:48.181
that is driving the culture
wars in this country, Gabe.


614
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.381
- We created the conditions
in these neighborhoods,


615
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:51.749
and then we send cops to them,

616
01:00:51.818 --> 01:00:52.884
and you sit here and defend
them when they kill a kid


617
01:00:52.952 --> 01:00:54.252
that could just as well
have been yours,


618
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:56.560
and that makes you complicit,
so yes, yes, David,


619
01:00:56.629 --> 01:00:57.761
the marketing is pointing
a finger at you.


620
01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:00.996
- Okay, we didn't create
these conditions, Gabe.


621
01:01:01.065 --> 01:01:04.197
We're Jewish.
We came from ghettos, too.


622
01:01:04.266 --> 01:01:06.100
- Jews enjoy the privileges
of being white.


623
01:01:06.169 --> 01:01:07.568
- Only in New York.

624
01:01:07.637 --> 01:01:09.906
- What's happening is that
people like you and the media


625
01:01:09.975 --> 01:01:12.238
are using people like
Eric Garner,


626
01:01:12.307 --> 01:01:14.504
isolated incidents,
to justify your agenda.


627
01:01:14.573 --> 01:01:16.781
- Freddie Gray
was an isolated incident?


628
01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:18.409
Mike Brown was
an isolated incident?


629
01:01:18.478 --> 01:01:19.677
- Freddie Gray had a knife.

630
01:01:19.746 --> 01:01:23.447
Mike Brown was fighting a cop
over control of a gun.


631
01:01:23.516 --> 01:01:25.218
If you do that,
you might get shot.


632
01:01:25.287 --> 01:01:28.760
- 12 times?
Unarmed kid shot 12 times?


633
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:30.223
- Okay, relax.
- Don't tell me to relax.


634
01:01:30.292 --> 01:01:31.763
- I just don't think that
you're appreciating


635
01:01:31.832 --> 01:01:33.131
how difficult it is
to be a policeman


636
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.931
in these neighborhoods.
- Try being Black in them.


637
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.262
- Because you would know.

638
01:01:36.331 --> 01:01:37.901
- We know what it's like to be

639
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:39.265
part of a persecuted minority.

640
01:01:39.334 --> 01:01:41.036
- Yes, which is exactly why

641
01:01:41.105 --> 01:01:43.104
we, of all people,
should understand.


642
01:01:43.173 --> 01:01:46.338
- Gabe, we picked ourselves up
as a people


643
01:01:46.407 --> 01:01:47.573
because of strong family values

644
01:01:47.642 --> 01:01:49.506
and a culture
that prioritizes education,


645
01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:51.508
not because we said
our lives matter.


646
01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:52.916
- When these kids are
playing basketball,


647
01:01:52.985 --> 01:01:54.017
my kid is doing his homework.

648
01:01:54.086 --> 01:01:56.315
- Okay, I don't even--
That's just racist.


649
01:01:56.384 --> 01:01:58.988
- Oh, my God, racist, really?
- Racist--that's not racist.


650
01:01:59.057 --> 01:02:01.122
- First of all, there's nothing
wrong with playing basketball.


651
01:02:01.191 --> 01:02:02.490
- You're gonna play
the race card?


652
01:02:02.559 --> 01:02:05.060
- Second, you're not taking
into account the history.


653
01:02:05.129 --> 01:02:07.029
- There's your history,
and there's my history.


654
01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:08.459
- You're a numbers guy,
right, David?


655
01:02:08.528 --> 01:02:09.560
- Sure.

656
01:02:09.629 --> 01:02:10.928
- Kid born in
a poor neighborhood


657
01:02:10.997 --> 01:02:13.871
with high levels of crime
is less likely to go to college


658
01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.071
and more likely to end up
in jail or shot by a cop


659
01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.534
than a kid born
in this neighborhood.


660
01:02:17.603 --> 01:02:18.635
- The Black people
who work for me,


661
01:02:18.704 --> 01:02:19.970
they would be so annoyed
by this argument.


662
01:02:20.039 --> 01:02:23.177
- They're more likely to end up
in jail or shot by a cop


663
01:02:23.246 --> 01:02:25.476
than a kid born
in this neighborhood,


664
01:02:25.545 --> 01:02:26.644
than a kid born in this house.

665
01:02:26.713 --> 01:02:28.215
That has nothing to do
with your family values.


666
01:02:28.284 --> 01:02:29.416
That's--that's just math.

667
01:02:29.485 --> 01:02:30.651
- There's your math,
and there's my math.


668
01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.956
- No, there's not--
you can't have your own math,


669
01:02:33.025 --> 01:02:35.189
your own history,
fucking alternative facts.


670
01:02:35.258 --> 01:02:36.960
What's the point of even trying
to fucking talk about it?


671
01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:38.262
- Don't curse
in front of my kid.


672
01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:40.491
- Right, cursing,
because that's his problem.


673
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.793
- What do you know
about problems?


674
01:02:41.861 --> 01:02:44.264
You generate no income.
You're responsible to no one.


675
01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:46.365
- I have an income, but it's
not your kind of income.


676
01:02:46.434 --> 01:02:47.833
I volunteer.

677
01:02:47.902 --> 01:02:49.135
I'm responsible to people,
just not your kind of people.


678
01:02:49.203 --> 01:02:50.469
- Oh, we should put a statue
of you up in Central Park.


679
01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:52.910
Why don't we knock down
the one of Christopher Columbus


680
01:02:52.979 --> 01:02:53.878
and put one of you instead?

681
01:02:53.947 --> 01:02:54.979
- My teacher says

682
01:02:55.048 --> 01:02:56.247
Christopher Columbus
was a bad man.


683
01:02:56.316 --> 01:02:57.248
- Your teacher's right.
- Ignore your uncle.


684
01:02:57.317 --> 01:02:59.281
- Stop it.
- He's my brother,


685
01:02:59.349 --> 01:03:00.415
and I love him,
but he's a loser,


686
01:03:00.484 --> 01:03:01.450
and these ideas
encourage him to be one.


687
01:03:01.518 --> 01:03:03.349
- I'd rather be a loser
than a bigot.


688
01:03:03.418 --> 01:03:04.350
- Go upstairs, Jared.

689
01:03:04.419 --> 01:03:05.184

some of the things


690
01:03:05.253 --> 01:03:06.419
he was saying to me upstairs.

691
01:03:06.488 --> 01:03:08.752
- What do you mean?
What were you saying?


692
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.994
- Seriously, what do you
have him reading, "Mein Kampf"?


693
01:03:11.063 --> 01:03:13.524
- Loser.
- I'm a loser?


694
01:03:13.593 --> 01:03:14.625
You talk about money

get a job.

Raising a child is a job, Gabe.

777
01:40:08.575 --> 01:40:11.146
This is taking forever!

778
01:40:11.215 --> 01:40:13.808
Does anything fucking work
right anymore?


779
01:40:13.877 --> 01:40:16.712
I got somewhere to be!
I got a meeting!


780
01:40:21.753 --> 01:40:23.488
I'm just fucking with you.
I don't have anywhere to be.


781
01:40:23.557 --> 01:40:26.590
I don't have a meeting.
I don't even have a job.


782
01:40:30.333 --> 01:40:31.793
Hey, what about you there,
Miss Lonely Heart?


783
01:40:31.862 --> 01:40:33.762
You got a job?

784
01:40:37.373 --> 01:40:39.636
You remind me
a lot of my mother.


785
01:40:52.784 --> 01:40:55.751
It's okay.
I get it.


786
01:40:55.820 --> 01:40:58.193
You're a sick puppy,
aren't you?


787
01:41:02.266 --> 01:41:05.200
I'm a sick puppy, too.

788
01:41:07.931 --> 01:41:12.504
That's why
I'm gonna spare you...


789
01:41:12.573 --> 01:41:15.540
even though you are
pretty fucking ungrateful.


790
01:41:19.514 --> 01:41:21.249
Hey, guess what.

791
01:41:25.619 --> 01:41:27.288
I'm so fucking full of love,
I feel like--


792
01:41:27.357 --> 01:41:29.389
- He's got a gun!
