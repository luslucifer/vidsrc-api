1
00:02:44.757 --> 00:02:47.673
Nawal, where are you?

2
00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:49.048
You know it's the right time
for us to try.


3
00:03:51.048 --> 00:03:52.590
We already tried yesterday.

4
00:03:52.673 --> 00:03:57.090
The doctor said we need to try
on all my fertile days.


5
00:03:58.882 --> 00:04:00.757
Maybe it worked yesterday?

6
00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:06.715
Besides, it's my problem,
not yours, right?


7
00:04:06.798 --> 00:04:09.173
I'm the one who's on medication.

8
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.798
Please, Nawal, let me sleep.
I'm exhausted.


9
00:04:14.882 --> 00:04:18.048
We'll try again tomorrow.

10
00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:52.548
Adnan!

11
00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:56.882
Adnan, come on, get up!

12
00:05:01.382 --> 00:05:02.840
Nora.

13
00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:04.090
Are you awake?

14
00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:05.382
Yes!

15
00:05:05.507 --> 00:05:07.671
Wake your father up,
otherwise, you guys will be late!


16
00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:10.423
I tried, but he
doesn't want to wake up.

17
00:05:12.257 --> 00:05:14.257
Hurry up and get dressed!

18
00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:17.090
Adnan.

19
00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:19.673
Come on, you'll be late.
Get up!


20
00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:22.507
Wake your dad up.

21
00:05:30.465 --> 00:05:31.507
Dad,

22
00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:34.715
you promised to take me to the mall.

23
00:05:35.007 --> 00:05:37.465
Come on, now.
Mom will get pissed.


24
00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.215
Adnan, what's wrong?

25
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.673
Come on, get up.

26
00:05:45.048 --> 00:05:46.673
Adnan.

27
00:06:02.382 --> 00:06:03.423
Peace be upon you.

28
00:06:04.132 --> 00:06:05.590
Peace be upon you.

29
00:06:07.132 --> 00:06:09.048
My sincere condolences, sister Um Nora.

30
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.382
May Allah give you the strength,
to overcome this ordeal.


31
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.882
When a woman loses her husband,
she actually loses her lover, partner,


32
00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:18.798
and everything in her life.

33
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.048
Let's pray to God
for mercy and forgiveness on him.


34
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.465
Repeat after me:

35
00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:26.090
Dear God, please have mercy, forgive him
and shroud him with Your blessings.


36
00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:27.298
Amen.

37
00:06:27.382 --> 00:06:30.798
The light of this house is extinguished
and it is draped in darkness.


38
00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:34.382
Dear God, give him a better home
than this home,


39
00:06:34.465 --> 00:06:37.757
and allow him into paradise
along with the righteous.


40
00:06:37.882 --> 00:06:40.632
- Amen.
- Amen.


41
00:06:41.132 --> 00:06:43.423
Sister Nawal, dear sisters,

42
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.090
a widow is obliged before God,

43
00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:48.548
to safeguard her husband's reputation
and honor.


44
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.298
She may not leave her house
for four lunar months and 10 days.


45
00:06:53.632 --> 00:06:56.715
But if you have duties
or responsibilities,


46
00:06:56.798 --> 00:06:59.632
then you may leave
the house to do them.


47
00:06:59.882 --> 00:07:02.840
But you must return before sunset.

48
00:07:03.007 --> 00:07:08.257
Because, dear sisters,
devils roam the world after sunset.


49
00:07:08.632 --> 00:07:13.257
And you must avoid gatherings
to avoid succumbing to temptation.


50
00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:23.298
Did you hear from your employers,
when do they expect you to return to work?


51
00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:26.257
After the wake is over.

52
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.882
You couldn't ask for more time?

53
00:07:29.298 --> 00:07:30.965
They barely managed without me.

54
00:07:31.048 --> 00:07:33.798
I fear if I take more days off,
they will replace me.


55
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.090
What about Nora?
She needs time.


56
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.007
Honestly, I don't know...

57
00:07:41.298 --> 00:07:44.465
She stays with Feryal after school,
as usual.


58
00:07:44.548 --> 00:07:46.632
Of course, I will take care of Nora,
as always.


59
00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:49.173
Bring her over whenever you want,
I'm available.


60
00:07:49.215 --> 00:07:51.548
Thank you, dear.
I know you're always there.


61
00:07:51.715 --> 00:07:53.173
My sweetheart.

62
00:08:09.965 --> 00:08:12.465
These are the pajamas
Adnan had on.


63
00:08:20.298 --> 00:08:23.798
And these are the keys to the pick-up.
It's parked downstairs.


64
00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:28.548
This is his golden tooth.

65
00:08:39.423 --> 00:08:42.340
If you wish,
I'll let Ghayda sleep over tonight?


66
00:08:46.132 --> 00:08:50.548
Better let her go home and rest.
She's been on her feet all day.


67
00:08:53.923 --> 00:08:55.882
You are strong and pious.

68
00:08:56.215 --> 00:08:58.507
This is God's will, right?

69
00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:21.340
Hello Rifqi, come in.

70
00:09:21.382 --> 00:09:23.007
Peace be upon you.

71
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.423
- Thank you.
- Call the kids.


72
00:09:25.507 --> 00:09:27.173
They will eat later.

73
00:09:27.382 --> 00:09:29.465
Come in, please, come in.

74
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.715
Am I going to school tomorrow?

75
00:09:55.215 --> 00:09:56.923
No.

76
00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:07.590
Is everyone coming tomorrow?

77
00:10:09.757 --> 00:10:10.965
Yes.

78
00:10:11.423 --> 00:10:13.548
And the day after tomorrow, as well.

79
00:10:15.132 --> 00:10:19.215
Are my cousins also coming?

80
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.757
Will Dad be upset if I missed school?

81
00:10:42.715 --> 00:10:43.798
No.

82
00:10:44.048 --> 00:10:45.382
Finish your dinner.

83
00:10:51.882 --> 00:10:54.215
Did Dad die or pass away?

84
00:10:58.007 --> 00:11:00.965
Dying and passing away
are the same thing.


85
00:11:03.507 --> 00:11:05.132
Why?

86
00:11:10.048 --> 00:11:12.173
Because he got tired.

87
00:11:12.882 --> 00:11:16.798
Come on, finish up your food quickly
so you can wash up and go to bed.


88
00:11:40.798 --> 00:11:42.132
Nora!

89
00:11:42.465 --> 00:11:44.048
Wake up, we're late!

90
00:11:44.882 --> 00:11:46.132
I'm up.

91
00:11:46.215 --> 00:11:48.048
Are you done?
Get ready!


92
00:11:48.132 --> 00:11:49.298
One minute.

93
00:11:49.465 --> 00:11:52.590
You don't have a minute,
we have to leave now.


94
00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:56.215
I'm ready.

95
00:11:59.215 --> 00:12:00.715
Alright.

96
00:12:02.298 --> 00:12:04.757
Well done for getting ready quickly.

97
00:12:05.798 --> 00:12:07.382
Tie up your laces.

98
00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:16.090
How did Dad teach you?

99
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.298
Two rabbits' ears,
then we cross them like this...


100
00:12:23.382 --> 00:12:24.965
Don't move.

101
00:12:25.382 --> 00:12:28.132
Watch how I tie it.

102
00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:39.923
Here's the pick-up.

103
00:12:42.257 --> 00:12:45.507
Come on, we don't
want to miss the bus.

104
00:12:49.132 --> 00:12:52.340
<i>The topic for the coming hour
is dedicated to the problem</i>


105
00:12:52.382 --> 00:12:54.048
<i>of water scarcity in Jordan.</i>

106
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.590
<i>International reports warn against
critical defiencies in water supply,</i>


107
00:12:57.632 --> 00:13:00.712
<i>which is an issue that neither previous
nor current government were able to...</i>


108
00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:21.298
May he rest in peace, dear.

109
00:13:21.423 --> 00:13:22.840
My heartfelt condolences.

110
00:13:22.882 --> 00:13:23.965
Thank you.

111
00:13:24.048 --> 00:13:26.048
You have to be strong.

112
00:13:26.132 --> 00:13:28.132
If you need anything,
we're here for you.


113
00:13:29.965 --> 00:13:33.090
I was worried that you'd ask
for more days off.


114
00:13:33.592 --> 00:13:36.132
It's been three days and she won't let
anyone bathe her but you.


115
00:13:36.923 --> 00:13:38.840
Colette is on the veranda!

116
00:13:43.882 --> 00:13:45.507
How are you, gorgeous?

117
00:13:50.965 --> 00:13:52.298
What's up, dear?

118
00:13:55.048 --> 00:13:56.923
Did you miss me?

119
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.298
I missed you, too.

120
00:14:17.548 --> 00:14:18.798
How are you, Nawal?

121
00:14:21.257 --> 00:14:22.715
I'm sorry for your loss.

122
00:14:23.048 --> 00:14:24.173
Thank you.

123
00:14:24.715 --> 00:14:25.798
I wanted to call you,

124
00:14:25.882 --> 00:14:29.090
but I felt it might be inappropriate.

125
00:14:29.173 --> 00:14:30.215
No worries.

126
00:14:31.507 --> 00:14:34.090
- Give it to me love.
- Shall we get started?


127
00:14:37.798 --> 00:14:39.132
How are you, gorgeous?

128
00:14:39.882 --> 00:14:43.840
Are you this happy
because your friend is back?


129
00:14:54.465 --> 00:14:59.173
I didn't expect you to show up today,
I thought you'd take a few more days off.


130
00:15:00.965 --> 00:15:04.257
- Just to rest a bit.
- I feel better today.


131
00:15:10.882 --> 00:15:13.673
If you need anything, I'm here for you,
you know that.


132
00:15:17.673 --> 00:15:21.173
Enough with your shy attitude,
I'm serious.


133
00:15:21.298 --> 00:15:24.007
We've known each other
for over four years now.


134
00:15:44.882 --> 00:15:46.632
How are you, Lauren?

135
00:15:46.757 --> 00:15:48.632
I'm sorry for your loss, honey.

136
00:15:48.923 --> 00:15:50.423
May he rest in peace.

137
00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:54.548
You never get fed up with repeating
the same thing over and over again.


138
00:15:54.757 --> 00:15:57.507
I told you a million times,
even if your dad and I approve,


139
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.882
the church will not approve,
They need a compelling reason.


140
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.840
Not now for God's sake.

141
00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:08.173
Her rambling is more than enough.

142
00:16:08.257 --> 00:16:10.382
All men like to play around.

143
00:16:10.507 --> 00:16:12.882
Do as other women do.

144
00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:15.090
Even Bill Clinton cheated on his wife!

145
00:16:15.215 --> 00:16:18.257
What did she do? Nothing.

146
00:16:18.507 --> 00:16:22.382
And there she is, a respectable lady
appreciated by everyone.


147
00:16:22.465 --> 00:16:24.798
How much did I
put up with your dad

148
00:16:25.007 --> 00:16:28.548
and his senseless behavior?

149
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.882
Just for your sake
and to keep this family intact.


150
00:16:33.048 --> 00:16:37.215
You need to put up with it and be patient,
that's it!


151
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.298
All he does is screw around,

152
00:16:40.382 --> 00:16:42.132
and you're telling me
to put up with it?

153
00:16:42.215 --> 00:16:44.132
This isn't a compelling reason
for the priest?


154
00:16:44.215 --> 00:16:46.382
You need witnesses, smartass!

155
00:16:46.465 --> 00:16:49.132
Should I set up a photoshoot of
him in bed with another woman?


156
00:16:52.465 --> 00:16:55.590
Or what do you think if I send
his shirts to the priest


157
00:16:55.673 --> 00:16:58.132
to smell the other women's perfumes?

158
00:16:58.257 --> 00:17:00.215
What better proof do you want, Mom?

159
00:17:00.465 --> 00:17:02.465
Stop this nonsense!

160
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.673
Mocking the priest, too!

161
00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:05.715
What's so funny?

162
00:17:09.132 --> 00:17:10.257
I didn't mean it.

163
00:17:12.715 --> 00:17:14.715
Why didn't you marry me off
when I was 14?


164
00:17:14.798 --> 00:17:16.382
It's legal here.

165
00:17:16.715 --> 00:17:19.590
It would've been the only life I'd know
and could've been happy with!


166
00:17:20.423 --> 00:17:24.423
This way, I wouldn't have displeased
the church or caused you a scandal.


167
00:17:27.173 --> 00:17:28.798
Forget about her food for now.

168
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.840
Fix her manicure before you leave.

169
00:17:32.132 --> 00:17:34.590
The guests are arriving
early in the morning.


170
00:17:34.632 --> 00:17:36.173
We don't want to create a scene.

171
00:17:36.965 --> 00:17:38.215
She's on an empty stomach.

172
00:17:39.132 --> 00:17:40.923
Do as I say.

173
00:17:55.632 --> 00:17:57.048
Screaming won't help.

174
00:18:00.632 --> 00:18:02.882
Then what would you do
if you were in my shoes?


175
00:18:06.507 --> 00:18:08.423
There's a key to every man.

176
00:18:09.132 --> 00:18:11.340
Am I married to
a human or a lock?

177
00:18:12.173 --> 00:18:15.590
Why make it difficult?
He's a player, with or without a key.


178
00:18:18.132 --> 00:18:20.798
Eventually God will guide him
to the right path.


179
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.715
This is the hope I should cling to?

180
00:18:22.882 --> 00:18:26.215
That God will guide him?
And what if God doesn't guide him?


181
00:18:26.257 --> 00:18:28.798
Should I wait for him
till he's done with all the sluts in town?


182
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.923
I'd never live like my mom,

183
00:18:42.048 --> 00:18:45.715
stuck in this house waiting
for his majesty to return to me.


184
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.215
It's better than spending
the rest of your life alone.


185
00:19:05.173 --> 00:19:07.132
Oh, I wish I was the bag!

186
00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:14.840
My love.

187
00:19:15.048 --> 00:19:16.715
You're late.

188
00:19:17.673 --> 00:19:21.423
There was traffic, and the bus was late
and I was worried it would get dark.


189
00:19:21.465 --> 00:19:25.090
- Here you go, I made you fried tomatoes.
- Thank you.


190
00:19:25.215 --> 00:19:27.548
Your brother tried calling you
several times.


191
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.590
He said you're not picking up.

192
00:19:29.715 --> 00:19:31.798
I didn't hear it ring.

193
00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.465
Ok, I'll call him now.

194
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.965
- Thanks, Feryal.
- Take care.


195
00:19:41.882 --> 00:19:43.215
I can't hear you.

196
00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:46.507
<i>I was worried that something
had happened to you.</i>


197
00:19:46.715 --> 00:19:50.507
No, don't worry, all is well.

198
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.882
<i>Good.</i>

199
00:19:53.007 --> 00:19:56.923
<i>Rifqi called me, he wants to come by
to check on you and Nora.</i>


200
00:19:57.173 --> 00:20:00.507
Okay, we're home,
you're welcome to come.


201
00:20:01.048 --> 00:20:03.382
<i>Okay, I will call him now.
Bye.</i>


202
00:20:04.007 --> 00:20:06.007
Okay. Bye.

203
00:20:24.923 --> 00:20:28.298
Take it easy,
the food isn't going anywhere.


204
00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:31.465
I want to watch cartoons.

205
00:20:37.965 --> 00:20:39.882
What was that noise?

206
00:20:49.465 --> 00:20:51.132
No, no, don't get close!

207
00:20:51.215 --> 00:20:52.757
Get out, hurry!

208
00:20:54.923 --> 00:20:56.298
Hold on, hold on.

209
00:21:09.507 --> 00:21:11.298
- How are you, Nora?
- Fine.


210
00:21:11.798 --> 00:21:13.423
My love.
How are you, sister?


211
00:21:13.507 --> 00:21:15.298
- Come in, Rifqi.
- Hello.


212
00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:17.507
- Good evening.
- Good evening.


213
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.840
How are you?

214
00:21:19.215 --> 00:21:21.798
- There is a mouse in the kitchen!
- Seriously?


215
00:21:21.923 --> 00:21:25.257
- I hope you're not afraid of it.
- No, I'm brave, I'm not afraid.


216
00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.673
Such a good girl,

217
00:21:28.382 --> 00:21:30.132
I love you so much.

218
00:21:30.215 --> 00:21:31.965
Look what I got you.

219
00:21:32.923 --> 00:21:34.632
When will you come
for a sleepover?


220
00:21:36.048 --> 00:21:37.840
During the school break, God willing.

221
00:21:37.923 --> 00:21:38.965
That's right.

222
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.132
- I want to see full marks this year, ok?
- Ok.


223
00:21:42.257 --> 00:21:43.715
Come in.

224
00:21:51.173 --> 00:21:53.632
How are you today, Nawal?
Better, I hope?


225
00:21:54.173 --> 00:21:57.548
- Thank God, I'm fine.
- Thank God.


226
00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.382
If you need anything, I'm here.

227
00:22:01.007 --> 00:22:02.507
We're already burdening you.

228
00:22:02.757 --> 00:22:05.465
No trouble at all.

229
00:22:05.798 --> 00:22:10.423
If we don't support each other, who will?
We're family.


230
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.757
As I said, whatever you or Nora need,

231
00:22:14.632 --> 00:22:16.173
consider it my responsibility.

232
00:22:16.715 --> 00:22:18.048
Thank you, Rifqi.

233
00:22:18.423 --> 00:22:21.007
We're all family
and we will all help.


234
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.132
May he rest in peace.

235
00:22:25.923 --> 00:22:29.507
I was thinking of reciting the Quran
in his memory, every Monday.


236
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.965
Yes,

237
00:22:33.173 --> 00:22:35.507
let's recite the Quran every Monday.

238
00:22:43.048 --> 00:22:44.923
I don't know what to do.

239
00:22:46.923 --> 00:22:50.007
This came as a shock.

240
00:22:50.882 --> 00:22:53.632
- No might except by God...
- God doesn't forget anyone.


241
00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:58.007
I forgot to ask,
what would you like to drink?


242
00:22:58.132 --> 00:22:59.798
Coffee.

243
00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.507
Did you see any of Adnan's colleagues
at the wake?


244
00:23:11.715 --> 00:23:14.215
I don't know, many people came.
I didn't notice.


245
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.215
Did you know that he wasn't getting paid
the last 4 months?


246
00:23:22.465 --> 00:23:24.382
No. Who told you that?

247
00:23:25.173 --> 00:23:26.840
Go sit over there.

248
00:23:35.798 --> 00:23:39.673
Adnan told me,
because there are 4 instalments...


249
00:23:40.632 --> 00:23:42.132
God will make it up...

250
00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:46.090
What instalments?

251
00:23:47.215 --> 00:23:50.173
I don't know what to say,
I'm embarrassed.


252
00:23:50.423 --> 00:23:52.590
Regarding the pick-up...

253
00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:56.090
Adnan still owes me 4 instalments.

254
00:23:57.882 --> 00:23:59.673
He never mentioned it.

255
00:24:00.465 --> 00:24:03.132
If I wasn't in need for the money,
I wouldn't have mentioned it,


256
00:24:03.215 --> 00:24:07.132
but I'm in a financially tight situation

257
00:24:07.215 --> 00:24:09.673
and Adnan promised to pay me soon.

258
00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:12.548
It's weird he never mentioned anything.

259
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.548
I have the promissory notes
if you would like to see them.


260
00:24:16.173 --> 00:24:17.965
No, I didn't mean,

261
00:24:18.257 --> 00:24:19.798
but...

262
00:24:21.007 --> 00:24:23.757
why weren't his employers
paying him?


263
00:24:24.215 --> 00:24:26.257
He never mentioned it.

264
00:24:26.757 --> 00:24:28.548
Don't worry about it.

265
00:24:28.923 --> 00:24:32.048
I'll find a buyer for the pick-up soon,
we'll sell it,


266
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.582
I'll take my payments, and distribute
the rest among the inheritors.


267
00:24:36.465 --> 00:24:38.507
But I don't want to sell the pick-up.

268
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.132
I thought this would be better
than you paying the debt.


269
00:24:44.257 --> 00:24:46.048
Don't worry, I'll manage.

270
00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.840
What do you need the pick-up for?

271
00:24:50.382 --> 00:24:51.923
You don't know how to drive.

272
00:24:57.798 --> 00:24:58.840
Do what you see best.

273
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.340
Anyways, everything will be clear
after the inheritance paperwork.


274
00:25:06.507 --> 00:25:11.507
But what did Adnan leave behind,
besides this apartment and the pick-up?


275
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.340
Just the apartment and the pick-up.

276
00:25:15.173 --> 00:25:19.507
Okay, just wanted to check, as I'll start
the inheritance procedures tomorrow.


277
00:25:20.048 --> 00:25:21.298
I got you.

278
00:25:29.965 --> 00:25:34.173
The apartment is in Adnan's name,
but he is not the sole owner.


279
00:25:34.257 --> 00:25:36.923
You're his brother,
the closest person to him...


280
00:25:37.257 --> 00:25:41.215
and you surely know
that the down payment for the apartment


281
00:25:41.298 --> 00:25:44.298
was from my inheritance,
from my late father,


282
00:25:44.757 --> 00:25:47.715
and on top of it, I sold all my jewelry
to cover the full payment.


283
00:25:48.007 --> 00:25:50.757
The monthly instalments
were settled from both our salaries.


284
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.965
Of course, sister,

285
00:25:53.548 --> 00:25:56.423
and I'm sure you have a document
that proves your ownership stake.


286
00:25:56.507 --> 00:25:59.882
Yes, Adnan had a lawyer draft an agreement
a few years ago.


287
00:26:00.257 --> 00:26:02.132
Then why isn't the apartment
in your name?


288
00:26:03.465 --> 00:26:08.048
Because the mortgage was made against
his employment contract.


289
00:26:08.298 --> 00:26:11.048
I don't have a contract,
I don't work for a company.


290
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.757
Can I see the agreement
Adnan's lawyer did?


291
00:26:15.423 --> 00:26:16.673
I'll bring it right away.

292
00:26:20.132 --> 00:26:22.840
And please get the family record book.

293
00:26:22.923 --> 00:26:23.923
Ok.

294
00:26:36.465 --> 00:26:38.923
Adnan swore that he
did it and signed it.


295
00:26:40.007 --> 00:26:42.465
I don't understand why he didn't sign it.

296
00:27:02.007 --> 00:27:03.173
What are you doing?

297
00:27:03.632 --> 00:27:05.923
He must have forgotten.
I will sign on his behalf!


298
00:27:06.007 --> 00:27:08.173
Just like that, you'll sign it
and solve the problem?


299
00:27:08.215 --> 00:27:11.965
This whole document is useless
without the official stamps!


300
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.757
What should I do now?

301
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.048
I have no idea.
Let's see what Rifqi has to say.


302
00:28:07.673 --> 00:28:11.048
<i>HASSAN - PHYSIO:
Can I call to check on you...</i>


303
00:28:27.382 --> 00:28:28.923
Hurry up, Nora.

304
00:28:30.923 --> 00:28:32.507
Yes, Mrs. Souad.

305
00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:34.215
I'm on my way.

306
00:28:34.798 --> 00:28:35.798
Nawal.

307
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.090
Ok, sure.

308
00:28:40.548 --> 00:28:42.923
- Get in, I will drive you.
- I'm so sorry.


309
00:28:48.423 --> 00:28:50.798
The traffic in Amman
is becoming unbearable!


310
00:28:53.923 --> 00:28:55.257
Come on, move!

311
00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.840
Ahmad told me about the agreement.

312
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.923
What do you plan to do now?

313
00:29:05.007 --> 00:29:06.132
In regard to what?

314
00:29:06.423 --> 00:29:07.798
The pick-up instalments.

315
00:29:09.882 --> 00:29:11.507
I still don't know.

316
00:29:12.757 --> 00:29:14.382
Do you have any jewelry to sell?

317
00:29:19.507 --> 00:29:21.632
I don't know, I will sort it out.

318
00:29:23.465 --> 00:29:26.257
I'll get out here,
I don't want to miss the bus.


319
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.090
Our esteemed lady, Colette,

320
00:30:00.673 --> 00:30:04.507
or as we used to call you,
"Madame Colette".


321
00:30:05.465 --> 00:30:10.007
The efforts, sacrifices and love
that you have given us…


322
00:30:18.007 --> 00:30:19.382
I'm a week late.

323
00:30:25.465 --> 00:30:26.923
Do you think I'm pregnant?

324
00:30:30.215 --> 00:30:31.423
Have you tested?

325
00:30:39.757 --> 00:30:40.965
Did you tell your mom?

326
00:30:41.048 --> 00:30:42.215
No.

327
00:30:44.048 --> 00:30:45.340
I'm not ready.

328
00:30:47.048 --> 00:30:48.757
Maybe that's the solution?

329
00:30:49.923 --> 00:30:53.590
When he becomes a father,
he'll change and will be responsible.


330
00:30:54.178 --> 00:30:57.058
If a baby is going to change him,
I don't want a baby in the first place.


331
00:30:59.215 --> 00:31:02.090
I don't even feel
I have a maternal instinct,


332
00:31:04.465 --> 00:31:06.173
or the desire to give birth.

333
00:31:10.132 --> 00:31:12.632
No one is born with this feeling,

334
00:31:13.632 --> 00:31:15.548
it grows on you
after you have a child.

335
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.048
If you didn't want to be a mother,
why did you get married then?


336
00:31:25.298 --> 00:31:26.715
Because I liked him,

337
00:31:27.048 --> 00:31:28.548
and I wanted to have sex with him.

338
00:31:29.798 --> 00:31:32.590
Our twisted logic says
that if a woman likes a man


339
00:31:32.673 --> 00:31:34.840
and wants to have sex with him,

340
00:31:35.132 --> 00:31:36.757
the only solution is to marry him.

341
00:31:36.798 --> 00:31:38.548
And getting married,
means having children.


342
00:31:39.007 --> 00:31:42.757
So, in order to have sex,
you should get stuck in this vortex,


343
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:45.382
and ruin your life forever.

344
00:31:46.715 --> 00:31:47.840
Lauren!

345
00:32:11.465 --> 00:32:14.132
It makes a loud explosion!

346
00:32:15.257 --> 00:32:16.840
SpongeBob...

347
00:32:17.423 --> 00:32:19.715
he wished he could drive.

348
00:32:22.548 --> 00:32:25.090
Why's the place such a mess?

349
00:32:25.173 --> 00:32:26.465
Hello!

350
00:32:27.465 --> 00:32:28.798
How did you get in?

351
00:32:28.882 --> 00:32:30.673
I took the keys from Feryal.

352
00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:34.173
I've been calling you all morning,
why aren't you answering?


353
00:32:34.257 --> 00:32:36.798
He drove me crazy
asking for the pick-up instalments.


354
00:32:36.923 --> 00:32:38.548
I was at work.

355
00:32:38.798 --> 00:32:41.798
You know I can't answer calls
while I am at work.


356
00:32:41.965 --> 00:32:43.590
Then go tell him that.

357
00:32:55.257 --> 00:32:57.340
It ran away!
It's as if it knew!


358
00:32:57.423 --> 00:32:59.007
I'll catch it eventually.

359
00:33:11.382 --> 00:33:13.423
- Welcome, Rifqi.
- Hi, Nawal.


360
00:33:20.673 --> 00:33:22.632
Uncle wants to kill the mouse.

361
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:26.132
Mice are impure,
they only come to dirty houses.


362
00:33:27.382 --> 00:33:29.382
But we clean the apartment every day.

363
00:33:30.298 --> 00:33:34.590
Your uncle doesn't mean
that our home is dirty.


364
00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:39.840
The mouse could have entered
from the drains, or from the staircase.


365
00:33:39.923 --> 00:33:42.215
We have to get rid of it
so it won't get us sick.


366
00:33:43.757 --> 00:33:46.382
- How did you do in the religion quiz?
- I did well!


367
00:33:46.465 --> 00:33:49.382
Did you figure out the issue
with Adnan's salary?


368
00:33:49.923 --> 00:33:53.298
I wanted to pass by his workplace today,
but I didn't have time.


369
00:33:53.382 --> 00:33:55.423
I'll go in the next couple of days.

370
00:33:55.965 --> 00:33:59.340
I'm sorry for being too pushy,
I honestly don't mean to,


371
00:33:59.465 --> 00:34:03.215
but as I told you, I'm pressed for cash
and have no other solutions.


372
00:34:03.298 --> 00:34:05.840
If Adnan was alive,
he would have saved me from this rut.


373
00:34:05.923 --> 00:34:10.173
The problem is that I don't have the cash
to pay you right away.


374
00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:12.465
This is why I suggested selling
the pick-up.


375
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.048
And I told you,
I don't want to sell it.


376
00:34:15.632 --> 00:34:17.007
Ok, as you wish.

377
00:34:17.298 --> 00:34:19.423
The pick-up issue is clear now.

378
00:34:20.215 --> 00:34:22.757
I'll sort it out and pay you back.

379
00:34:23.298 --> 00:34:26.507
I finalized the inheritance document
today.


380
00:34:27.257 --> 00:34:29.632
Since you didn't find the agreement,

381
00:34:30.215 --> 00:34:32.673
my sisters and I
inherit half the apartment


382
00:34:32.757 --> 00:34:34.048
and half the pick-up.

383
00:34:34.257 --> 00:34:36.965
I found the agreement,
but Adnan forgot to sign.


384
00:34:37.507 --> 00:34:39.298
That means there is no contract.

385
00:34:39.923 --> 00:34:41.548
I'm not lying to you!

386
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.382
Besides, how would you like me
to divide the apartment?


387
00:34:44.465 --> 00:34:45.590
Calm down,

388
00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.715
we haven't decided on anything yet,
why are you nervous?


389
00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.298
I'm just trying to explain
the situation to you.


390
00:34:51.757 --> 00:34:54.840
If the inheritance was in cash,
you could take it all,


391
00:34:54.965 --> 00:34:57.108
but it's only this apartment
where my daughter and I live.


392
00:34:57.132 --> 00:34:59.465
Dear Nawal, it's not about the money.

393
00:34:59.548 --> 00:35:02.132
This is our right,
and this is how things work.


394
00:35:02.715 --> 00:35:06.048
I suggest selling the apartment,
you settle the instalments,


395
00:35:06.173 --> 00:35:07.965
and we then distribute the shares.

396
00:35:08.257 --> 00:35:10.090
What if I had a boy?

397
00:35:10.257 --> 00:35:11.840
Would you have been able to do that?

398
00:35:13.798 --> 00:35:16.340
Nawal, please, no need for this attitude.

399
00:35:16.465 --> 00:35:19.215
We all have our problems,
and we all want them resolved.


400
00:35:19.257 --> 00:35:21.548
If you have another solution,
please spit it out!


401
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.173
If we leave this apartment,

402
00:35:23.257 --> 00:35:25.257
we have nowhere else to live!

403
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.343
Where will we go?

404
00:35:26.394 --> 00:35:28.298
My dear sister-in-law,
I'm still here for you.


405
00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.548
Will I leave my niece homeless?

406
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.382
Ahmad and I will manage,
don't worry.


407
00:35:32.465 --> 00:35:33.882
Listen up,

408
00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.507
this is my home
and I'm not selling it.


409
00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.798
I have nothing more to add!

410
00:35:36.882 --> 00:35:38.507
- Calm down, calm down.
- Sit properly!


411
00:35:38.548 --> 00:35:40.173
Calm down, we're family.

412
00:35:40.257 --> 00:35:41.798
We'll definitely find a solution.

413
00:35:43.298 --> 00:35:47.798
I could easily leave the house
that I am renting


414
00:35:47.923 --> 00:35:49.965
and move here with
my wife and children.


415
00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:51.507
Will that be better?

416
00:35:55.423 --> 00:35:57.132
Turn off the TV!

417
00:36:02.298 --> 00:36:03.382
Mom,

418
00:36:03.465 --> 00:36:05.757
did you fear mice
when you were a child?


419
00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.173
When I was a child, 
I feared nothing.

420
00:36:12.007 --> 00:36:14.298
Then why are you afraid of them now?

421
00:36:17.632 --> 00:36:19.965
Because everyone is afraid of them.

422
00:36:20.215 --> 00:36:21.923
But they're small and harmless.

423
00:36:22.007 --> 00:36:23.923
And they carry diseases
and they're disgusting,


424
00:36:24.007 --> 00:36:25.590
and stop blabbering.

425
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.215
Dad's phone!

426
00:36:37.465 --> 00:36:38.715
Come on, sleep.

427
00:36:50.507 --> 00:36:51.548
Hello?

428
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.173
Can you unlock this phone?

429
00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.048
Is it your phone?

430
00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.423
Yes, why?

431
00:37:17.965 --> 00:37:19.965
Did you forget the password?

432
00:37:20.382 --> 00:37:21.465
Yes.

433
00:37:22.423 --> 00:37:25.257
The number is registered
under your name?


434
00:37:27.132 --> 00:37:28.715
No, my husband's.

435
00:37:30.757 --> 00:37:32.673
How can I know it's your husband's?

436
00:37:32.757 --> 00:37:34.923
What do you mean?
I stole it?


437
00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.632
First, I must format it
in order to unlock it.


438
00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:43.673
Second, I don't need trouble.

439
00:37:43.798 --> 00:37:46.340
Alright.
Your first excuse was sufficient, thanks.


440
00:37:46.423 --> 00:37:47.923
You're welcome.

441
00:38:03.673 --> 00:38:05.257
May Adnan rest in peace.

442
00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.340
I apologize that we didn't pay our
respects, but no one informed us.


443
00:38:09.423 --> 00:38:10.507
Thank you.

444
00:38:11.923 --> 00:38:17.215
I'm here to ask about Adnan's
last salary and social security.


445
00:38:18.132 --> 00:38:20.548
Adnan left us over 4 months ago.

446
00:38:20.632 --> 00:38:22.007
We don't owe him anything!

447
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.590
Four months?

448
00:38:25.965 --> 00:38:27.965
Do you know to which company he moved?

449
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.465
Actually, ma'am, he left on bad terms,

450
00:38:31.632 --> 00:38:34.090
and since then, we lost contact.

451
00:38:35.465 --> 00:38:37.507
What kind of bad terms?
Was he fired?


452
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:41.798
He's passed away now,
may he rest in peace.


453
00:38:45.215 --> 00:38:50.173
With all honesty, he was tired lately
and had health issues.


454
00:38:51.007 --> 00:38:54.423
We can raise some funds.
I can ask his colleagues to contribute.


455
00:38:54.507 --> 00:38:55.507
No, no need,

456
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.048
I just want his social security
and tax documents.


457
00:38:59.215 --> 00:39:01.382
Ok, I'll get them for you.

458
00:39:50.673 --> 00:39:54.382
Why are you staring at me like this
and leaving Aunt Colette alone?


459
00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.798
Hassan is with her.

460
00:40:00.715 --> 00:40:02.048
Are you drinking cinnamon?

461
00:40:02.132 --> 00:40:04.024
Since we live in the Middle Ages
in this country,


462
00:40:04.048 --> 00:40:06.257
abortion pills are forbidden.

463
00:40:07.465 --> 00:40:08.840
So, it's confirmed?

464
00:40:18.007 --> 00:40:20.215
Why should your baby pay the price?

465
00:40:25.507 --> 00:40:27.673
I don't want a baby that resembles him.

466
00:40:52.923 --> 00:40:54.007
Nawal.

467
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.132
Nawal!

468
00:40:56.215 --> 00:40:57.715
Get in, I'll drive you home.

469
00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:00.298
That's not possible.

470
00:41:00.382 --> 00:41:03.632
I want us to talk outside work,
and you won't let me drive you home


471
00:41:03.715 --> 00:41:05.507
and you don't answer my messages.

472
00:41:16.673 --> 00:41:20.632
Excuse me sister, where is the residence
of the late Adnan Mansour Khalaf?


473
00:41:21.173 --> 00:41:24.340
- I'm his wife.
- Can you please sign here?


474
00:41:24.673 --> 00:41:26.507
What's that?

475
00:41:27.048 --> 00:41:29.798
This is a notification to appear in court.

476
00:41:29.923 --> 00:41:32.840
- For what?
- A case to divide property.


477
00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.548
Filed by the brother of the deceased.

478
00:41:36.465 --> 00:41:38.215
Please sign here.

479
00:41:43.923 --> 00:41:44.965
Thank you.

480
00:41:48.257 --> 00:41:52.132
- What's going on?
- Rifqi wants to kick me out of our home.


481
00:41:52.215 --> 00:41:54.298
What a shame!

482
00:41:54.382 --> 00:41:56.923
Did you inherit any cash?

483
00:41:57.007 --> 00:41:59.673
What do you mean
there's nothing we can do?


484
00:42:03.007 --> 00:42:04.007
Fine.

485
00:42:04.882 --> 00:42:06.007
Fine.

486
00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.715
I'll tell the judge
that he's throwing us on the streets!


487
00:42:16.423 --> 00:42:17.840
Keep the door shut!

488
00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:24.673
No, no...

489
00:42:24.798 --> 00:42:27.382
No, I won't argue with anyone.

490
00:42:27.465 --> 00:42:29.882
I won't argue with anyone.

491
00:42:33.757 --> 00:42:37.465
I'll just calmly tell him what happened.

492
00:42:38.132 --> 00:42:39.507
Bye!

493
00:42:46.048 --> 00:42:49.048
He wants to sell the apartment
to get cash.


494
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.382
Can you afford to rent?

495
00:42:57.423 --> 00:42:58.798
I couldn't find it.

496
00:42:59.298 --> 00:43:03.298
Don't worry, he's probably taking a nap,
to wake up at night like yesterday.


497
00:43:03.382 --> 00:43:06.923
Grab your sandwich,
we're eating in the TV room,


498
00:43:07.132 --> 00:43:09.632
so we won't disturb Mr. Mouse.

499
00:43:10.132 --> 00:43:11.257
Here.

500
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.632
- No, thanks.
- Come on.


501
00:43:14.548 --> 00:43:15.757
Thank you.

502
00:43:18.215 --> 00:43:19.298
That's all you needed.

503
00:43:19.757 --> 00:43:21.923
As if the misery you're in isn't enough!

504
00:43:23.715 --> 00:43:25.173
Thanks for that.

505
00:43:25.965 --> 00:43:27.715
That's not what I meant!

506
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.132
You're a widow with a daughter,

507
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:36.757
suitors won't be lining up by your door.

508
00:43:37.632 --> 00:43:41.632
Besides, if you sell the apartment,
the girl will move to Rifqi's place.


509
00:43:41.923 --> 00:43:44.215
Are you fine with your daughter
living away from you?


510
00:43:47.007 --> 00:43:49.298
No one can talk some sense into Rifqi?

511
00:43:49.382 --> 00:43:52.923
What does...
What does your brother think?


512
00:43:53.632 --> 00:43:55.423
Finish your sandwich, Nora.

513
00:43:58.798 --> 00:44:00.340
When is the court hearing?

514
00:44:02.132 --> 00:44:03.257
Tomorrow.

515
00:44:05.965 --> 00:44:08.632
He's definitely in a hurry.

516
00:44:11.632 --> 00:44:14.465
Have faith in God.

517
00:44:14.798 --> 00:44:16.215
He will guide you.

518
00:44:16.757 --> 00:44:22.590
Take a bath now, perform ablution,
pray for "guidance,"


519
00:44:22.673 --> 00:44:26.132
and hopefully God will send you a sign
of relief.


520
00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:12.757
Um Nora!

521
00:46:15.007 --> 00:46:16.507
I'm not the only late one!

522
00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:18.548
He just called me, he'll be here shortly.

523
00:46:23.173 --> 00:46:25.632
Are they going to give him
the apartment today?


524
00:46:25.757 --> 00:46:27.007
Trust in God.

525
00:46:27.132 --> 00:46:29.090
Everything God wills is good.

526
00:46:45.507 --> 00:46:48.215
What will happen if Rifqi
decides to sell the apartment?


527
00:46:49.548 --> 00:46:52.215
You can live with me until
I find you a decent husband.


528
00:46:52.298 --> 00:46:56.382
- And lose Nora's custody!
- Rifqi and his wife will do their best!


529
00:46:56.548 --> 00:46:59.257
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Rifqi.


530
00:46:59.798 --> 00:47:01.423
Good morning, Um Nora.

531
00:47:06.548 --> 00:47:11.257
The inheritors are his wife, his daughter,
his brother, and his two sisters.


532
00:47:11.465 --> 00:47:14.715
The brother represents the family
that lives abroad.


533
00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:16.298
The assets are clear.

534
00:47:16.882 --> 00:47:19.465
Anyone has more information
they would like to add?


535
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:21.798
Amongst the documents I submitted
to Your Honor


536
00:47:21.882 --> 00:47:24.965
there is the contract of the pick-up
that my husband bought from his brother.


537
00:47:25.048 --> 00:47:28.132
It shows the instalments
he has already paid.


538
00:47:28.257 --> 00:47:30.757
That's right sister,
Rifqi attached the contract,


539
00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.757
and you still have 4 instalments to pay.

540
00:47:33.923 --> 00:47:36.173
Are there other inheritors
I didn't mention?


541
00:47:36.257 --> 00:47:38.340
Or debts I missed mentioning?

542
00:47:39.215 --> 00:47:42.173
If not, then this should be fairly
straightforward.


543
00:47:43.632 --> 00:47:45.465
In fact, Your Honor...

544
00:47:45.632 --> 00:47:48.590
my husband borrowed
from me my inheritance


545
00:47:48.715 --> 00:47:50.715
and my gold dowry,

546
00:47:50.923 --> 00:47:53.590
which we used as
the down payment for the apartment.


547
00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.340
I also used to pay from my salary
to cover the bank mortgage.


548
00:47:58.007 --> 00:47:59.548
Do you have proof of that?

549
00:47:59.632 --> 00:48:03.132
A contract between you and your husband?
A bank letter?


550
00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.298
No, I don't.

551
00:48:06.382 --> 00:48:09.215
If you don't have a document,
then I can't record this officially.


552
00:48:09.382 --> 00:48:11.382
Did any of you witness or hear

553
00:48:11.465 --> 00:48:13.423
that the deceased borrowed money
from his wife?


554
00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:16.423
The deceased never mentioned this to me.

555
00:48:17.965 --> 00:48:20.215
Did the deceased have any
other source of income?


556
00:48:20.298 --> 00:48:22.340
He used to manage his affairs by himself.

557
00:48:22.382 --> 00:48:25.382
He was a man always
up to his responsibilities.


558
00:48:26.715 --> 00:48:31.173
Sister, the family of the deceased
has a right to a share of his inheritance


559
00:48:31.298 --> 00:48:33.673
in the case the husband does not have
a son with his wife.


560
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:36.233
In other words, they are responsible
before God and the public


561
00:48:36.257 --> 00:48:37.899
for taking care of the wife
and her children.


562
00:48:37.923 --> 00:48:39.590
What responsibility, Your Honor?

563
00:48:39.757 --> 00:48:42.173
He wants to sell our home
to cash out his share!


564
00:48:42.257 --> 00:48:43.774
But he is obliged to support
your daughter,


565
00:48:43.798 --> 00:48:46.382
and if he refuses, you can sue him.

566
00:48:50.673 --> 00:48:52.840
Your Honor, can we talk in private?

567
00:48:54.923 --> 00:48:57.257
Please step outside
till I call you back in.


568
00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.132
Go ahead.

569
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.382
Sir, I'm pregnant.

570
00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:13.590
Why did you want
to say this in private?

571
00:49:13.715 --> 00:49:16.007
Anyway, this is the jurisdiction
of the Sharia court.


572
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:18.715
Take a pregnancy test
and show them the result


573
00:49:18.798 --> 00:49:21.965
so they can adjust the inheritance.
Then you come back here.


574
00:49:23.048 --> 00:49:25.798
Please call back Rifqi Khalaf,
case number 47.


575
00:49:31.382 --> 00:49:36.048
Concerning the inheritance
of the late Adnan Mansour Khalaf


576
00:49:36.132 --> 00:49:39.548
who passed away on 21 February, 2019,

577
00:49:39.632 --> 00:49:43.382
and according to the documents provided,
the deceased left the following behind:


578
00:49:43.465 --> 00:49:47.173
(1) An apartment worth

579
00:49:47.257 --> 00:49:49.798
(2) A debt of 1,000 dinars
of pick-up instalments


580
00:49:49.882 --> 00:49:52.048
owed to his brother, 
Rifqi Mansour Khalaf.

581
00:49:52.423 --> 00:49:55.840
(3) Termination of marriage dowry of

582
00:49:55.965 --> 00:49:58.715
(4) House furniture
as per the marriage contract,


583
00:49:58.798 --> 00:50:00.590
considered a delayed dowry.

584
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.007
But due to the pregnancy of his wife
Nawal Tayseer Abdullah,


585
00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:06.149
we have decided to postpone the request
for distribution of the inheritance


586
00:50:06.173 --> 00:50:09.007
until we receive
the amended inheritance.


587
00:50:34.173 --> 00:50:37.840
We tried to call you many times today.
Your phone isn't working?


588
00:50:38.215 --> 00:50:42.007
Sister, even if your phone is silent,
keep an eye on it.


589
00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:43.733
If something happens to the girl,
God forbid,


590
00:50:43.757 --> 00:50:47.048
or the house catches fire,
how can we reach you?


591
00:50:48.923 --> 00:50:50.757
Yes, true.

592
00:50:51.382 --> 00:50:54.632
Nawal, I'm not here to tell you
what to do or not to do


593
00:50:54.715 --> 00:50:57.632
but your responsibilities increased
since my late brother died.


594
00:50:57.673 --> 00:50:58.798
Certainly,

595
00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:01.673
and thanks to you,
I will have less responsibilities!


596
00:51:01.757 --> 00:51:05.382
- Bless the Prophet! Guys, calm down.
- Blessed be the Prophet,


597
00:51:05.465 --> 00:51:07.965
but everyone should mind
their own business.


598
00:51:08.048 --> 00:51:11.215
I have the right to intervene
when I see my niece out till midnight,


599
00:51:11.298 --> 00:51:13.507
and her mother doesn't pick up the phone.

600
00:51:13.632 --> 00:51:16.798
Your niece, whom you want
to kick out from her home?


601
00:51:17.048 --> 00:51:18.757
Nawal, I'm not here to make trouble.

602
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.465
Nora is always welcome at my place!

603
00:51:21.548 --> 00:51:23.673
We also have rights, too, just like you.

604
00:51:23.757 --> 00:51:26.423
Why should my sisters be deprived
of their brother's inheritance?


605
00:51:26.507 --> 00:51:30.340
But they're both married
and have their houses!


606
00:51:30.423 --> 00:51:32.298
Regarding the home,
it's all clear,


607
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.020
and inshallah you will
give birth to a boy.


608
00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.465
And regarding the pick-up,
when will you repay me?


609
00:51:36.548 --> 00:51:39.548
- Two or 3 more months!
- No, I can't wait that long!


610
00:51:39.715 --> 00:51:43.173
I don't get it,
why is it suddenly so urgent?


611
00:51:45.507 --> 00:51:48.590
Did you even ask yourself
who paid for the burial and wake?


612
00:51:52.632 --> 00:51:54.090
Peace be upon you.

613
00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.798
And upon you.

614
00:52:22.048 --> 00:52:25.298
- How are you, Siham?
- Good, and you?


615
00:52:27.257 --> 00:52:28.382
I'm okay.

616
00:52:28.465 --> 00:52:30.048
Is everything okay?

617
00:52:30.632 --> 00:52:32.048
Listen...

618
00:52:34.132 --> 00:52:35.173
What is it?

619
00:52:35.632 --> 00:52:37.590
I'm here for a blood pregnancy test.

620
00:52:37.632 --> 00:52:40.715
- Are you pregnant?
- I'm not sure, I want to check.


621
00:52:41.923 --> 00:52:45.298
Trust in God, the child comes
and his sustenance comes with him.


622
00:52:45.382 --> 00:52:50.548
- When will the results be out?
- Don't worry, I will expedite it.


623
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:54.757
- Don't worry at all.
- Thank you.


624
00:53:53.382 --> 00:53:55.233
If the court finds out
that the report is fabricated...


625
00:53:55.257 --> 00:53:57.173
They won't find out!

626
00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:01.132
What do you mean they won't find out!

627
00:54:01.215 --> 00:54:03.382
Eventually in 2 or 3 months,

628
00:54:03.715 --> 00:54:06.132
it will be obvious.

629
00:54:06.257 --> 00:54:08.548
I can’t help you,

630
00:54:08.673 --> 00:54:11.298
this will get us both in trouble.

631
00:54:26.298 --> 00:54:27.757
Hello, honey.

632
00:54:28.757 --> 00:54:31.298
- Congrats, I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.


633
00:54:31.382 --> 00:54:32.590
Come in.

634
00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.173
Welcome sister, come in,
you're no stranger.


635
00:54:35.507 --> 00:54:38.590
I wish you'd brought more meat.

636
00:54:38.798 --> 00:54:40.798
I hope Nora didn't
give you a hard time.

637
00:54:40.965 --> 00:54:42.173
Not at all,

638
00:54:42.465 --> 00:54:44.090
no trouble at all.

639
00:54:44.215 --> 00:54:45.882
Where is she?

640
00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:48.290
Her uncle picked her up
after she finished her homework.


641
00:54:53.923 --> 00:54:55.507
Why did you let him take her?

642
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.173
What's wrong with her visiting her uncle?

643
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.423
Nawal, for God's sake,
give me a break from all this.


644
00:55:03.007 --> 00:55:06.007
I would have asked you
if you answered your phone!


645
00:55:06.132 --> 00:55:09.090
Come on, go to your room, get going.

646
00:55:12.715 --> 00:55:14.298
Come on, clear this room.

647
00:55:14.632 --> 00:55:16.715
No grumbling!

648
00:55:20.632 --> 00:55:22.965
Don't bother, I'm leaving.

649
00:55:26.048 --> 00:55:28.048
Go on, get up...

650
00:55:31.007 --> 00:55:33.632
Nawal, I don't understand what the
problem is.


651
00:55:33.673 --> 00:55:36.313
He took her over for an hour
and will return her home. Don't worry!


652
00:55:36.382 --> 00:55:38.923
It's not about him taking her or not.

653
00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:42.465
It's the injustice of it all
while I am helpless!


654
00:55:42.548 --> 00:55:44.673
Today, it's a visit, later,
when he forces me


655
00:55:44.715 --> 00:55:46.798
to sell our home,
he'll take her for good!


656
00:55:46.882 --> 00:55:50.548
You're overthinking this,
it's not worth it.


657
00:55:51.048 --> 00:55:53.965
When are we going to court
so we can get done with his nagging?


658
00:55:54.923 --> 00:55:56.173
In a couple of days.

659
00:55:56.965 --> 00:55:57.965
Alright.

660
00:56:00.965 --> 00:56:04.090
I'm selling the bedroom furniture
to pay for the pick-up.


661
00:56:04.173 --> 00:56:06.923
- You won't get much for it.
- I don't care.


662
00:56:07.673 --> 00:56:09.548
I'll sort out
the remaining instalments later.


663
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.798
Do you have a buyer?

664
00:56:12.465 --> 00:56:15.257
You're so stubborn.
I'll find someone tomorrow.


665
00:56:16.215 --> 00:56:18.840
Sister, I want you to remain strong, ok?

666
00:56:19.007 --> 00:56:20.173
Come in.

667
00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.632
Nawal, I'm glad you arrived.

668
00:56:24.715 --> 00:56:28.632
There's a man in this building
looking for the pick-up's owner.


669
00:56:28.715 --> 00:56:30.923
Movers are getting furniture

670
00:56:31.007 --> 00:56:33.590
and they need to park
in the pick-up's spot.


671
00:56:33.673 --> 00:56:35.423
Ok, I'll take care of it.

672
00:56:35.548 --> 00:56:38.882
Ok, bye, I am in a hurry.
Talk to you later.


673
00:56:40.673 --> 00:56:44.298
<i>Step one, empty the water in the toilet.</i>

674
00:56:44.507 --> 00:56:49.423
<i>Invite a pregnant friend of yours over
and offer her all sorts of liquids...</i>


675
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:54.007
<i>HOW TO FORGE A PREGNANCY TEST</i>

676
00:59:29.757 --> 00:59:32.548
Uncle Rifqi told me
I'm going to have a brother.


677
00:59:32.673 --> 00:59:34.132
Get inside.

678
00:59:34.548 --> 00:59:36.090
We don't know yet.

679
00:59:36.965 --> 00:59:39.548
As soon as I find out,
I promise to tell you.


680
00:59:40.132 --> 00:59:41.923
But look,

681
00:59:42.215 --> 00:59:45.340
until then, we won't tell anyone.

682
00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.173
It's our secret, deal?

683
01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:01.798
Why are you watching TV now?

684
01:00:01.923 --> 01:00:04.840
Go wash up and get changed
so you'll have dinner and sleep early.


685
01:00:04.882 --> 01:00:06.048
I don't want to sleep early!

686
01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.715
I want to play after dinner!

687
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.298
You've been playing all day,
haven't you had enough?


688
01:00:11.382 --> 01:00:13.548
I haven't, and I don't want
to go to their place again.


689
01:00:16.298 --> 01:00:17.965
Can we go to McDonald's?

690
01:00:18.298 --> 01:00:21.840
It's late already and
I can't drive the car.


691
01:00:22.007 --> 01:00:24.965
We'll prepare homemade fries
better than McDonald's.


692
01:00:25.132 --> 01:00:28.965
No, I want to go to McDonald's,
like Dad used to take us.


693
01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:44.632
I promise you we'll go next week.

694
01:00:47.173 --> 01:00:50.882
Besides, I can't enter the kitchen alone.

695
01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:53.340
Did you forget about the mouse?

696
01:01:22.882 --> 01:01:24.590
Excuse me, Mrs. Souad.

697
01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:28.215
I'm sorry to bother you.

698
01:01:28.673 --> 01:01:31.423
I'm so embarrassed to ask, but...

699
01:01:31.757 --> 01:01:36.048
I have lots of commitments
and I need an advanced payment.


700
01:01:36.382 --> 01:01:37.673
If possible.

701
01:01:38.298 --> 01:01:39.673
Why do you need it?

702
01:01:40.715 --> 01:01:42.649
I have to pay off
my late husband's pick-up instalments


703
01:01:42.673 --> 01:01:45.257
and if I don't pay,
they will confiscate it.


704
01:01:45.382 --> 01:01:47.840
Ok, dear, I'll talk to Lauren's father
when he returns.


705
01:01:47.923 --> 01:01:51.048
If it were just a few dinars
I would have taken care of it,


706
01:01:51.173 --> 01:01:53.923
but the salary is his responsibility.

707
01:01:56.632 --> 01:01:57.882
Ok, thanks.

708
01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.507
Nawal.

709
01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:11.382
Just five minutes. I just need to rest a
bit, then we'll wake her up.


710
01:02:26.673 --> 01:02:29.090
When will you reply to my messages?

711
01:02:29.215 --> 01:02:31.590
Or should I give up?

712
01:02:37.298 --> 01:02:39.257
What's wrong with you today?

713
01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.132
You're out of charge.

714
01:02:46.715 --> 01:02:49.132
I don't understand,
what is it that you want?


715
01:02:50.132 --> 01:02:51.382
Nothing.

716
01:02:51.882 --> 01:02:53.132
Aren't we friends?

717
01:02:54.132 --> 01:02:56.215
I'm just worried about you.

718
01:02:56.382 --> 01:02:57.840
Don't worry.

719
01:03:02.923 --> 01:03:06.382
Besides, we're colleagues,
not friends.


720
01:03:10.465 --> 01:03:13.132
I thought we were more than that.

721
01:03:14.632 --> 01:03:17.132
I know what you're going through
isn't easy,


722
01:03:17.798 --> 01:03:19.840
that's why I keep checking on you.

723
01:03:20.632 --> 01:03:22.548
I don't want anything from you.

724
01:03:26.465 --> 01:03:28.757
It's just that...

725
01:03:29.423 --> 01:03:31.757
You can tell me.

726
01:03:32.965 --> 01:03:34.798
Everything is new to me.

727
01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.965
My entire life is in turmoil,
everything is new to me.


728
01:03:39.173 --> 01:03:42.757
A new problem pops up every day
and I must handle it,


729
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.007
and I'm clueless.

730
01:03:54.132 --> 01:03:58.590
For example, Adnan's pick-up is blocking
the building's foyer,


731
01:03:58.798 --> 01:04:00.798
and I don't know
how to drive to move it.


732
01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:04.757
This is your problem?

733
01:04:04.923 --> 01:04:06.798
I can park it for you.

734
01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:08.798
Thanks, you're so kind.

735
01:04:09.507 --> 01:04:10.798
My brother will do it.

736
01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.757
If you wish,
I can teach you how to drive.


737
01:04:57.673 --> 01:04:59.257
Do you need anything?

738
01:05:00.882 --> 01:05:02.507
Are you okay?

739
01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:07.048
What do you want?

740
01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.215
I need your help...

741
01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.382
a favor.

742
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.423
What favor?

743
01:05:43.423 --> 01:05:45.965
Can you take a pregnancy test
at the lab...


744
01:05:47.298 --> 01:05:48.757
under my name?

745
01:05:51.173 --> 01:05:52.298
What for?

746
01:05:53.882 --> 01:05:56.673
I told the judge I was pregnant.

747
01:05:57.173 --> 01:05:58.798
Inheritance issues.

748
01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:07.923
I need to be pregnant,

749
01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.840
otherwise, Adnan's family
will confiscate the apartment.


750
01:06:17.548 --> 01:06:19.840
Nora and I will be homeless.

751
01:06:23.715 --> 01:06:25.798
I prayed for "guidance"

752
01:06:25.923 --> 01:06:28.882
and I got a sign that I'm pregnant.

753
01:06:29.423 --> 01:06:32.965
And are you really pregnant,
Virgin Mary?


754
01:06:35.298 --> 01:06:36.715
I don't know.

755
01:06:37.132 --> 01:06:41.132
You can't not know,
you're either pregnant or you're not.


756
01:06:44.673 --> 01:06:46.923
By the way, if you download any app,

757
01:06:47.007 --> 01:06:50.465
there are millions of men
ready to get you pregnant.


758
01:06:51.632 --> 01:06:54.923
Just watch out not to hook up
with my stupid husband.


759
01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:59.757
I'm kidding, don't take it seriously.

760
01:07:07.965 --> 01:07:10.590
There's no way I'd do that.

761
01:07:11.298 --> 01:07:13.090
It's a sin!

762
01:07:14.757 --> 01:07:18.340
If it's a sin,
why did you lie to the judge?


763
01:07:20.465 --> 01:07:22.548
Are you really pregnant?

764
01:07:26.632 --> 01:07:29.673
You just want the apartment,
regardless.


765
01:07:35.507 --> 01:07:37.465
I mean...

766
01:07:38.507 --> 01:07:40.257
lying is a sin...

767
01:07:40.465 --> 01:07:42.090
sex is a sin...

768
01:07:42.215 --> 01:07:44.923
abortion is a sin...

769
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:51.132
but every sin has a motive
and a justification.


770
01:07:53.298 --> 01:07:56.715
I think that making you and your
daughter homeless is the sin,


771
01:07:58.882 --> 01:08:02.382
and maybe God
will see it the same way.


772
01:08:15.632 --> 01:08:16.965
I'll help you,

773
01:08:18.632 --> 01:08:21.298
but I need your help, too.

774
01:08:25.298 --> 01:08:28.423
I need you to find a doctor
to give me an abortion,


775
01:08:31.465 --> 01:08:33.548
and I want you to
come along with me.


776
01:08:54.757 --> 01:08:55.840
Ok.

777
01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.215
You can always say you miscarried.

778
01:09:04.673 --> 01:09:07.215
I just need a positive test.

779
01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:13.215
Oh, I wish I was the purse!

780
01:09:23.298 --> 01:09:24.548
Mom!

781
01:09:26.173 --> 01:09:27.632
What's this?

782
01:09:28.132 --> 01:09:30.382
- Get your stuff, quick.
- Hi, honey!


783
01:09:30.465 --> 01:09:31.507
How are you, Feryal?

784
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:35.090
So, Madam Nawal, why don't you share
with me your good news?


785
01:09:35.298 --> 01:09:37.715
I'm so happy for you.

786
01:09:38.132 --> 01:09:40.590
Nora told me you're pregnant,

787
01:09:40.757 --> 01:09:43.507
but I didn't tell anyone,
by the Quran, no one


788
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:47.382
and I told her not to tell anyone,
to avoid the evil eye.


789
01:09:47.507 --> 01:09:48.798
Indeed.

790
01:09:48.923 --> 01:09:52.465
Your brother passed by
and dropped off empty boxes.


791
01:09:53.215 --> 01:09:56.215
What are these boxes for?

792
01:09:57.090 --> 01:09:58.548
Are you moving out?

793
01:10:01.507 --> 01:10:03.173
You didn't answer me.

794
01:10:03.257 --> 01:10:05.715
Are you selling his clothes?

795
01:10:05.965 --> 01:10:07.340
Stop it!

796
01:10:08.132 --> 01:10:09.340
I have a headache.

797
01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:13.923
Super Nora!

798
01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:23.340
I kept my husband's clothes for 10 years
after he passed, before I gave them away.


799
01:10:27.382 --> 01:10:30.382
Remove this damn thing!

800
01:10:30.507 --> 01:10:32.590
- Sit down! Sit down!
- Let me see.


801
01:10:32.632 --> 01:10:36.882
I don't want to hear a word!
Understood?


802
01:10:37.423 --> 01:10:39.882
I can't take it anymore!

803
01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.840
Show me!
Who taught you this silly game?


804
01:10:45.923 --> 01:10:50.298
All young girls play it.
It encourages them to like the hijab.


805
01:10:50.382 --> 01:10:53.298
Calm down, you shouldn't stress,
it's bad for the baby.


806
01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:56.132
Were you this nervous
when pregnant with Nora?


807
01:10:56.173 --> 01:10:58.965
I was shit!
Leave me the fuck alone!


808
01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.090
Show me.

809
01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:09.798
Does it hurt here?

810
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.798
It's ok.

811
01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:47.090
<i>HASSAN</i>-<i>PHYSIO:</i>
<i>A driving lesson tomorrow?</i>


812
01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:09.715
<i>SWIPE RIGHT</i>

813
01:12:42.757 --> 01:12:44.882
What's with the hygiene?

814
01:12:45.048 --> 01:12:48.298
Couldn't you find a cleaner clinic?

815
01:12:48.382 --> 01:12:51.382
Today, you don't have much of a choice.

816
01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.465
Do I have to go in with you?

817
01:13:01.673 --> 01:13:04.882
Today, you don't have
much of a choice.


818
01:13:19.673 --> 01:13:23.548
CLOSED FOR 10 MINUTES
PRAYER TIME


819
01:13:38.298 --> 01:13:39.507
Come in.

820
01:13:49.965 --> 01:13:51.215
Abla, right?

821
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:54.673
- Yes.
- Can you please shut the door?


822
01:13:58.882 --> 01:13:59.923
Lock it.

823
01:14:06.673 --> 01:14:09.882
Abla, you need to sign this paper

824
01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:13.173
using your real name and national number.

825
01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.798
It states that you bear full
responsibility


826
01:14:22.882 --> 01:14:25.215
in case something goes wrong.

827
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:30.548
You also need to know if there's a pulse,
I will not kill the embryo.


828
01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.507
As agreed with the woman over the phone
it's 1,500 dinars to be paid in advance.


829
01:14:36.923 --> 01:14:37.923
Okay?

830
01:14:39.715 --> 01:14:40.757
Fine.

831
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:58.632
Doctor,

832
01:14:58.757 --> 01:15:02.007
why won't you operate
if there's a pulse?


833
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:07.007
A pulse means there's a soul,
and killing a soul is a crime.


834
01:15:08.632 --> 01:15:10.798
So, before the pulse, it's not a sin?

835
01:15:11.923 --> 01:15:15.090
It's a sin both ways, but killing
a soul is a bigger crime before God.


836
01:15:19.423 --> 01:15:20.590
Are you sure?

837
01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:25.715
I want to get it over and done.

838
01:15:31.090 --> 01:15:32.298
Breathe.

839
01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:54.840
Thank you, Nawal.

840
01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:59.840
Take care of yourself.

841
01:16:01.798 --> 01:16:03.673
I will call to check on you.

842
01:16:03.757 --> 01:16:05.882
If you need anything, just call me.

843
01:16:08.632 --> 01:16:09.632
Take this.

844
01:16:12.298 --> 01:16:15.715
Take it, buy something for Nora.

845
01:16:18.923 --> 01:16:21.298
We are all in the same shit.

846
01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.048
Your Honor, she recently discovered
her pregnancy


847
01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:39.132
and I'm glad to have a nephew,
but she's not paying the instalments…


848
01:16:39.173 --> 01:16:41.465
Why was the test
taken at a private lab?

849
01:16:42.715 --> 01:16:45.090
I don't understand, where should I do it?

850
01:16:45.173 --> 01:16:48.548
This test has to be done
by a medical jurisprudence.


851
01:16:49.048 --> 01:16:51.673
But no one told me...

852
01:16:52.257 --> 01:16:55.298
No problem, we'll redirect you
to a medical jurisprudence.


853
01:16:55.382 --> 01:16:57.340
The deceased had a debt and she...

854
01:16:57.423 --> 01:16:59.173
Why didn't you inform
the court about the


855
01:16:59.215 --> 01:17:01.465
pregnancy when you filed
for the list of inheritors?


856
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:04.108
I didn't know, Your Honor,
no one informed me, you can ask them.


857
01:17:04.132 --> 01:17:07.632
- No one told me.
- I wasn't sure back then.


858
01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:10.215
What debt are you talking about?

859
01:17:10.298 --> 01:17:12.548
Four pick-up instalments
that she refuses to pay!


860
01:17:12.632 --> 01:17:16.340
I didn't refuse. Your Honor, this was
a debt between him and his brother.


861
01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:18.882
I'm not obliged to
pay it on his terms!

862
01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:21.690
Debt is part of the inheritance,
and the inheritors should pay it.


863
01:17:21.882 --> 01:17:25.548
- I'm going to sell my bedroom furniture…
- What will that cover?


864
01:17:25.715 --> 01:17:28.715
- How will you pay the rest?
- I will sort it out, next month…


865
01:17:28.923 --> 01:17:29.923
Answer the question!

866
01:17:30.007 --> 01:17:32.507
I'm answering, don't interrupt me!

867
01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:34.507
Are you just going to stand there?

868
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:36.173
He has nothing to do with it!

869
01:17:36.257 --> 01:17:39.715
If you're not listening to your brother
or me, who will you listen to?


870
01:17:39.798 --> 01:17:42.215
Quiet, guys, please.

871
01:17:42.298 --> 01:17:44.441
I want you to answer the question,
when will you pay me?


872
01:17:44.465 --> 01:17:47.298
Quiet sir! I am the one
who asks the questions here, not you!


873
01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.465
You have 2 options:

874
01:17:49.673 --> 01:17:51.608
- You can either pay him...
- How will she pay, sir?


875
01:17:51.632 --> 01:17:53.733
Her salary is barely sufficient,
and she works until midnight,


876
01:17:53.757 --> 01:17:55.465
which means she can't take a second job!

877
01:17:55.548 --> 01:17:57.923
- Don't interrupt!
- So you know my circumstances,


878
01:17:58.048 --> 01:17:59.858
and still adamant
that I either pay the entire amount...


879
01:17:59.882 --> 01:18:03.048
- I told you to sell the pick-up!
- And I told you I don't want to!


880
01:18:03.132 --> 01:18:04.524
She still wants to learn how to drive!

881
01:18:04.548 --> 01:18:07.465
You're not giving me a chance
to breathe!


882
01:18:07.548 --> 01:18:09.840
Since Adnan passed away and you...

883
01:18:09.965 --> 01:18:11.465
Quiet!

884
01:18:13.798 --> 01:18:17.548
If any of you interrupts me again,
I will imprison you!


885
01:18:18.173 --> 01:18:19.757
Give her a week,

886
01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.923
if she doesn't pay, then you sell
the pick-up and close the debt,


887
01:18:23.048 --> 01:18:24.757
and the rest of the money will go

888
01:18:24.798 --> 01:18:27.048
to the court treasury
until you give birth.


889
01:18:27.132 --> 01:18:29.715
Give them a transfer letter
to a medical jurisprudence.


890
01:18:30.507 --> 01:18:32.840
Let's go do the damn test
and be done with it.


891
01:18:32.923 --> 01:18:35.132
I can't now,
I have to go back to work.


892
01:18:35.298 --> 01:18:39.340
Find the time. I don't want him to
keep nagging, he's driving me crazy!


893
01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:40.840
Ok.

894
01:19:02.757 --> 01:19:04.965
Load it, guys, 
I'll be right behind you.

895
01:19:08.423 --> 01:19:10.423
Here's 200 as agreed.

896
01:19:11.048 --> 01:19:13.882
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


897
01:20:27.882 --> 01:20:31.465
<i>My Name is Samira</i>

898
01:20:37.507 --> 01:20:41.173

Why are you still awake, honey?

902
01:21:16.465 --> 01:21:17.840
I can't sleep.

903
01:21:18.423 --> 01:21:20.507
Come sleep next to me.

904
01:22:02.798 --> 01:22:04.507
Where is Madam?

905
01:22:04.673 --> 01:22:06.382
Madam is sleeping.

906
01:22:06.465 --> 01:22:09.132
- And Madam Lauren?
- Madam Lauren left.


907
01:22:09.673 --> 01:22:12.840
- Where to?
- Her husband came and take her.


908
01:22:16.215 --> 01:22:18.340

910
01:22:48.965 --> 01:22:52.840
If you open your mouth
and mention what happened with Lauren,


911
01:22:52.923 --> 01:22:55.548
I swear I'll kill you.

912
01:22:57.257 --> 01:22:58.423
Where's Lauren?

913
01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.257
At her home.

914
01:23:00.882 --> 01:23:02.590
It's none of your business!

915
01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.465
Bathe her

916
01:23:05.548 --> 01:23:07.673
and feed her before you leave,

917
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:11.048
and tomorrow,
come collect your money


918
01:23:11.257 --> 01:23:14.715
and hand over the
job to the new nurse.

919
01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:50.923
<i>HASSAN - PHYSIO:
What happened with Souad?</i>


920
01:24:04.632 --> 01:24:06.798
Drive quickly,
I don't want anyone to see us.


921
01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.423
Ok, calm down.

922
01:24:10.757 --> 01:24:14.090
Who'd recognize you anyway
with this scowl?


923
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:18.632
Finally, a smile.
You worried me over the phone.


924
01:24:39.965 --> 01:24:42.757
Again, what do we do now?

925
01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:46.507
One foot on the gas pedal,
the other on the clutch,


926
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:48.257
at the same time.

927
01:24:48.423 --> 01:24:50.007
Gently.

928
01:24:51.673 --> 01:24:54.215
At the same time, gently.

929
01:24:56.173 --> 01:24:58.757
Or reverse...

930
01:24:59.132 --> 01:25:01.757
Yes, reverse.
Gently, gently.


931
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:07.340
When you reverse,
look backwards.


932
01:25:19.423 --> 01:25:22.882
It stalled because you didn't
step on the clutch.


933
01:25:34.007 --> 01:25:35.257
I need a favor.

934
01:25:38.215 --> 01:25:40.340
I need some money.

935
01:25:41.632 --> 01:25:42.632
How much do you need?

936
01:25:45.382 --> 01:25:46.757
500 dinars.

937
01:25:52.715 --> 01:25:54.757
I'm not going to ask what for,

938
01:25:55.423 --> 01:25:57.007
but what happened with Souad?

939
01:26:01.798 --> 01:26:04.173
I promise to pay you back next month.

940
01:26:06.382 --> 01:26:08.757
Souad asked me to find a new nurse.

941
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:42.465
I always wanted to see you
outside work.


942
01:26:48.173 --> 01:26:51.298
Do you know how much
I wished for this moment?


943
01:27:24.007 --> 01:27:26.340
I never imagined it's that long.

944
01:27:37.465 --> 01:27:38.840
Nawal...

945
01:27:40.757 --> 01:27:43.673
I know that you reciprocate my feelings,

946
01:27:44.548 --> 01:27:45.965
for a while now.

947
01:27:52.048 --> 01:27:53.798
Do you want to sleep with me?

948
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:05.757
I want more than that...

949
01:28:06.798 --> 01:28:08.673
I want a life with you.

950
01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:43.132
I love you.

951
01:29:15.382 --> 01:29:17.340
I want to go back home.

952
01:29:44.007 --> 01:29:45.590
I'll get out here.

953
01:29:55.465 --> 01:29:57.382
I'll get you the money tomorrow.

954
01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:23.923
Her uncle called and said
he'll pick her up from school


955
01:30:24.007 --> 01:30:25.423
and drop her back in the evening.

Why the hell did you leave
your house at night!


959
01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.673
I'm telling you Rifqi took Nora.

960
01:32:28.757 --> 01:32:31.257
It's your fault. Who's the man
that dropped you home today?


961
01:32:31.298 --> 01:32:35.132
A colleague who works at Souad's.
I was tired, so he drove me home.


962
01:32:35.215 --> 01:32:38.007
This is what you tell me instead
of defending me and draw him limits?


963
01:32:38.090 --> 01:32:40.590
I can't take this anymore,
there's a new problem every day!


964
01:32:40.757 --> 01:32:42.840
At this rate,
you're going to lose everything.


965
01:32:42.923 --> 01:32:46.298
- It's all my fault.
- Yes, it's your fault!


966
01:32:46.423 --> 01:32:48.590
How much did you repay him?
Nothing!


967
01:32:49.007 --> 01:32:51.048
The man has responsibilities,
many ends to meet.


968
01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:53.173
It's not his problem
that your husband was fired.


969
01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.923
Just sell the damn pick-up
and pay him back!


970
01:32:56.007 --> 01:32:58.090
I sold my bedroom furniture to pay him!

971
01:32:58.173 --> 01:33:01.923
You didn't even do the pregnancy test
to shut him up about the inheritance!


972
01:33:02.007 --> 01:33:07.340
And your daughter when she sees her mother
so stubborn and fighting with her uncle,


973
01:33:07.382 --> 01:33:09.022
what kind of woman
will she grow up to be?


974
01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.590
At least she won't be a coward!

975
01:33:13.382 --> 01:33:15.590
- What is it that you want now?
- I want my daughter!


976
01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:18.132
She is at her uncle's, no need
to make a big fuss about it!


977
01:33:20.173 --> 01:33:23.007
- I'm going to the police.
- That's all we need. Listen to me!


978
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:25.882
- I am going to the police!
- I said, sit down!


979
01:33:26.257 --> 01:33:28.215
Listen to me!
You will stay here tonight

01:33:28.298 --> 01:33:31.882
and I swear, if you leave,
I'll break your legs, understood!

There are a million widows out there,

01:33:36.715 --> 01:33:39.007
others raise their kids quietly,
except you!

What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

I'm fine, honey, I'm fine.

989

Did you have breakfast?

990
01:35:11.215 --> 01:35:13.090
Is your bag ready?

991
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:21.423
Ask the teacher to let you read
from your desk mate's book.


992

Come on, sweetheart, wash your face
so you won't be late to school.

I'll see you tonight.

How are you feeling?

998
01:36:51.757 --> 01:36:55.548
I tried calling you a hundred times,
but your phone's switched off.


999
01:37:00.507 --> 01:37:02.632
Who did this to her?

1000
01:37:21.507 --> 01:37:22.632
Get out.

1001
01:37:24.090 --> 01:37:25.382
Out!

1002
01:37:27.507 --> 01:37:29.715
Who gave you permission
to go in and see her?


1003
01:37:33.673 --> 01:37:35.007
Who did that to her?

1004
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:36.170
It's none of your business!

1005
01:37:36.465 --> 01:37:38.632
Did you stand by and watch silently?

1006
01:37:38.715 --> 01:37:42.423
Better than spending six months
in prison after what you two did.


1007
01:37:43.423 --> 01:37:46.423
Did you think this would go by
so smoothly?


1008
01:37:46.507 --> 01:37:47.798
My stupid daughter

1009
01:37:48.007 --> 01:37:49.798
thinks that she's a superwoman

1010
01:37:49.923 --> 01:37:52.548
who can say and do whatever pleases.

1011
01:37:55.632 --> 01:37:57.132
It's your fault.

1012

You did this to her.

1013
01:38:00.215 --> 01:38:01.715
I did this to her?

1014
01:38:02.423 --> 01:38:06.632
Just pray that her husband
doesn't sue you both.


1015
01:38:09.923 --> 01:38:11.257
Where are you going?

1016
01:38:12.173 --> 01:38:13.382
Get out.

1017
01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.965
Give me my money.

1018

- Oh my God!


1019

She's waking up!

1020
01:39:04.298 --> 01:39:08.590
- You're fine.
- You're fine.


1021
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:17.215
Are you ok?

Yes.

Are you the wife of the late
Adnan Mansour Khalaf?


1025
01:39:35.798 --> 01:39:38.382
- Sign here.
- What's this?


1026
01:39:40.257 --> 01:39:43.757
A notification for an urgent case
filed against you by Rifqi Mansour Khalaf


1027
01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:46.340
for custody of the deceased's daughter.

1028
01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:50.090
Here.

1029
01:39:54.632 --> 01:39:56.382
I'm not signing.

1030
01:39:56.465 --> 01:39:58.548
Sister, you must sign it.

1031
01:39:58.882 --> 01:40:00.715
I'm not signing!

1032
01:40:08.882 --> 01:40:14.465
The defendant was notified
and she refused to sign.


1033
01:40:16.048 --> 01:40:20.590
The court hearing is tomorrow at 9 AM.
You better show up.


1034
01:41:37.673 --> 01:41:40.632
Sister, your brother-in-law
filed an urgent case against you


1035
01:41:40.715 --> 01:41:43.840
demanding custody of your daughter
from your late husband,


1036
01:41:43.923 --> 01:41:45.798
claiming that you're incompetent.

1037
01:41:45.965 --> 01:41:47.757
What do you mean by incompetent?

1038
01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.507
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
but what did I do wrong?


1039
01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:55.340
Being out from morning to evening
renders you unfit to raise the child.


1040
01:41:55.423 --> 01:41:57.673
But I go to work, Your Honor.

1041
01:41:57.757 --> 01:42:00.132
That was the case
when my husband was alive,


1042
01:42:00.215 --> 01:42:03.173
because we needed my salary
to pay the bills.


1043
01:42:03.257 --> 01:42:05.715
- Where do you work?
- In a house in Amman.


1044
01:42:05.798 --> 01:42:08.149
I am caregiver for an old lady
who suffers from Alzheimer's.


1045
01:42:08.173 --> 01:42:10.798
Does it mean you leave the house
to provide for your family?


1046
01:42:10.882 --> 01:42:12.132
Of course!

1047
01:42:12.215 --> 01:42:14.465
Who takes care of the child
during your absence?


1048
01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:17.840
My neighbor, an old lady.
I pay her a monthly salary


1049
01:42:17.923 --> 01:42:20.798
and my daughter spends 3 hours
after school at her place.


1050
01:42:20.882 --> 01:42:26.798
Did Mr. Rifqi ever talk to you
about picking up the child late?


1051
01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:30.423
No. Besides, Your Honor, is it ok
that he picks her up from school


1052
01:42:30.507 --> 01:42:35.132
and keeps her at his place for two days
without informing me, her mother?


1053
01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:37.483
He neither answers his phone,
nor allow me to check on her,


1054
01:42:37.507 --> 01:42:38.858
and until now, he didn't return her!

1055
01:42:38.882 --> 01:42:41.802
Where's the problem, Your Honor,
if my niece, who is like a daughter to me


1056
01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.257
and reminds me of my late brother,
spends time with her family?


1057
01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:47.423
I informed her uncle!

1058
01:42:47.548 --> 01:42:51.007
Frankly, Your Honor, I'm worried
about her mother's behavior.


1059
01:42:51.090 --> 01:42:52.923
Additionally, she claims to be pregnant

1060
01:42:53.007 --> 01:42:56.715
and still hasn't done the test
requested by court.


1061
01:42:56.923 --> 01:43:00.340
First, the pregnancy issue
is not within this jurisdiction.


1062
01:43:00.423 --> 01:43:02.423
Second, your behavior is unacceptable.

1063
01:43:02.507 --> 01:43:04.715
Her mother is still the legal guardian

1064
01:43:04.798 --> 01:43:08.673
and you have no right to take the girl
without informing her.


1065
01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.132
Also, your reasons for claiming custody
are weak.


1066
01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.465
Sister, you need to pay attention
to your behavior,


1067
01:43:17.965 --> 01:43:22.007
starting with doing
the pregnancy test. Clear?


1068
01:43:26.507 --> 01:43:28.965
What's wrong with you now?
You won today.


1069
01:43:29.173 --> 01:43:30.215
What does he want?

1070
01:43:30.298 --> 01:43:32.818
He wants you to do the test
so we can figure out where we stand.


1071
01:43:33.173 --> 01:43:36.673
Tell him to leave me in peace.
I want to see my daughter.


1072
01:43:36.757 --> 01:43:39.548
No! We will do it now
and get done with it! Move!


1073
01:44:30.882 --> 01:44:33.548
How long before
the test results are out?


1074
01:44:33.715 --> 01:44:35.215
- What test?
- Pregnancy test.


1075
01:44:35.298 --> 01:44:37.215
An hour to an hour and a half,
at the latest.


1076
01:44:37.798 --> 01:44:40.007
- Let's wait!
- I'm going home!


1077
01:44:40.090 --> 01:44:42.608
Sister, let's wait until the result is out
and then we'll go home together!


1078
01:44:42.632 --> 01:44:44.257
I'm not your sister.

1079
01:44:49.548 --> 01:44:50.590
Nora!

1080
01:44:52.382 --> 01:44:55.173
Sweetheart. I am here.

1081
01:45:00.382 --> 01:45:02.798
Let me see your face.

1082
01:45:08.632 --> 01:45:11.548
Say bye to your cousins
before we leave.


1083
01:45:22.298 --> 01:45:24.548
These are three pick-up instalments.

1084
01:45:24.798 --> 01:45:28.632
- One more to go.
- Thank you, just in time.


1085
01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:40.090
Did Rifqi leave
the pick-up promissory notes?


1086
01:45:51.757 --> 01:45:53.173
Wait.

1087
01:45:54.673 --> 01:45:56.632
Wait for me here for a bit, honey.

1088
01:45:59.798 --> 01:46:03.882
How about you go play on the swings a bit?
Just for five minutes.


1089
01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.007
Give me your bag.

1090
01:46:18.298 --> 01:46:21.632
Why did you come now?
I have enough problems as it is.


1091
01:46:22.215 --> 01:46:24.590
You're not answering my calls.

1092
01:46:26.465 --> 01:46:28.715
Here's the money you requested.

1093
01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.548
I'm sorry, Hassan.

1094
01:46:37.132 --> 01:46:39.382
It's not going to work out...

1095
01:46:40.007 --> 01:46:41.632
I just can't...

1096
01:46:45.673 --> 01:46:46.840
Nora!

1097
01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:50.673
I wasn't late, see?

1098
01:47:00.132 --> 01:47:01.882
It looks like it's going to rain.

1099
01:47:11.007 --> 01:47:13.007
Oh, I wish I was the purse!

1100
01:47:16.215 --> 01:47:17.632
Wait here, honey.

1101
01:47:19.090 --> 01:47:21.048
You are so rude!

1102
01:47:21.132 --> 01:47:22.882
Run!

1103
01:47:48.798 --> 01:47:50.090
Where's your mom?

1104
01:47:55.298 --> 01:47:56.840
Here's the test result.

1105
01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:04.673
Rifqi can't do anything
for the coming 9 months.


1106
01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:07.840
But until you give birth, you remain
in mourning and return home early.


1107
01:48:07.923 --> 01:48:10.923
I will keep my eye on you!
Your phone stays on all the time,


1108
01:48:11.007 --> 01:48:15.673
even if I call you a hundred times a day,
you will answer every time, understood?
