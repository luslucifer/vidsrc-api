to all the working people of the USSR!

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:18.845
Dear comrades and friends!

Council of Ministers and the Presidium

12
00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:40.312

that on March 5,

16
00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:55.501
at 9.50 pm,

17
00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.709
the Chairman of Council of Ministers
of the USSR,


18
00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:06.626
the Secretary of the Central Committee

19
00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:14.361
of the Communist Party of the USSR,

20
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:22.464
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin
passed away after a serious illness.


21
00:04:23.552 --> 00:04:30.774
The heart of Lenin’s comrade-in-arms,
and visionary follower of Lenin’s cause,


22
00:04:31.818 --> 00:04:37.521
the wise leader of the Communist Party
and the Soviet people,


23
00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:44.058
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin,
has stopped beating.


24
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:18.931
Medical report on the cause of death
of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.


25
00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:24.040
On the night of March 2,
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin


26
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:28.192
suffered a haemorrhage
in the left hemisphere of the brain,


27
00:05:28.785 --> 00:05:32.562
caused by hypertension
and arteriosclerosis.


28
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.037
This resulted in a paralysis
of the right side of the body,


29
00:05:38.123 --> 00:05:39.989
and loss of consciousness.

30
00:05:40.812 --> 00:05:42.611
On the first day of the illness,

31
00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:48.621
breathing difficulty occurred
due to the damage to the nervous system.


32
00:05:50.154 --> 00:05:52.792
The condition worsened day by day.

33
00:05:53.614 --> 00:05:59.780
The breathing pattern was irregular,
with prolonged temporary stops –


34
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:01.776
so-called Cheyne
-Stokes respiration.

35
00:06:04.038 --> 00:06:05.835
On the night of March 3,

36
00:06:06.577 --> 00:06:11.147
respiratory arrests
became life-threatening.


37
00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:13.927
From the onset of illness,

38
00:06:14.018 --> 00:06:19.422
the following
cardiovascular disorders were diagnosed:


39
00:06:20.076 --> 00:06:25.493
high blood pressure,
rapid and irregular heartbeat,


40
00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:29.158
atrial fibrillation
and dilated cardiomyopathy.


41
00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:33.644
Oxygen deficiency caused by
the deterioration of the respiratory


42
00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:38.676
and cardiovascular systems
was observed on March 3.


43
00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:43.708
From the first day of illness,

44
00:06:44.595 --> 00:06:47.238
the patient had high fever
and leukocytosis –


45
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.499
possible symptoms of lung infection.

46
00:06:52.254 --> 00:06:54.416
On the last day of illness,

47
00:06:55.474 --> 00:06:57.875
the condition deteriorated rapidly

48
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:07.459
resulting in acute
heart failure and collapse.


49
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.585
ECG test revealed

50
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:17.316
acute restriction
of the blood flow in the coronary artery


51
00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:22.364
and damage to the heart muscle.

52
00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:25.784
In the afternoon of March 5,

53
00:07:26.938 --> 00:07:29.993
the patient’s condition
deteriorated rapidly.


54
00:07:30.943 --> 00:07:35.244
Fast and shallow breathing was observed,

55
00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:41.401
heartbeat rate increased to 140-150 bpm,

56
00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:44.817
the pulse force decreased.

57
00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:49.929
At 21 hours 50 minutes,

58
00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:58.715
due to cardiovascular
and respiratory failure,


59
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.032
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin died.

60
00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:12.546
Our first day without Stalin,

61
00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:16.192
It's the day when he is gone.

62
00:10:16.455 --> 00:10:20.170
Death has come,
and everything is useless.


63
00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:23.952
Death has come -
and we are all alone.


64
00:11:32.687 --> 00:11:37.666
The Soviet people promise
to work tirelessly


65
00:11:38.384 --> 00:11:42.851
in order to fulfill Stalin's cause

66
00:11:43.254 --> 00:11:45.186
and to build Communism.

67
00:11:46.151 --> 00:11:51.045
Long live Stalin's immortal cause!

68
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.505
Long live the great Soviet people,

69
00:11:55.689 --> 00:11:59.697
Communism builders, who will live
to see the triumph of Communism!


70
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.264
Stalin is dead, long live Stalin!

71
00:20:05.449 --> 00:20:09.310
Our Father passed away,
our hearts are full of sadness:


72
00:20:09.852 --> 00:20:12.238
He’ll never shake
a comrade’s hand again,


73
00:20:13.936 --> 00:20:17.899
But to his people
he has left his genius,


74
00:20:18.028 --> 00:20:21.158
His heart of steel
forever will remain!


75
00:20:22.082 --> 00:20:25.366
The sacred banners
carried by the comrades,


76
00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:28.842
A road full of hardships
lies ahead,


77
00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:33.296
The Central Committee,
invincible and glorious,


78
00:20:33.382 --> 00:20:37.673
Will overcome
and will defy his death!


79
00:20:43.044 --> 00:20:45.766
When all of us,
we saw him in his coffin,


80
00:20:47.278 --> 00:20:52.370
And said good-bye
and paid our last respects,


81
00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:57.876
We knew his might...

82
00:20:59.435 --> 00:21:04.201
But how softened his features now,
as he’s laid to rest.


83
00:21:05.812 --> 00:21:09.829
We knew he was the best
on our planet,


84
00:21:11.406 --> 00:21:14.499
Victorious in every battle,
every war,


85
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:20.864
To think of other people
was his tenet,


86
00:21:22.496 --> 00:21:27.231
His heart was selfless to the core.

87
00:21:28.947 --> 00:21:33.122
This tragedy has brought us
close together,


88
00:21:34.473 --> 00:21:39.011
As no joyful day has ever done,

89
00:21:39.753 --> 00:21:45.221
We stand united,
holding hands forever,


90
00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:49.279
We serve our Stalin,
we are all as one.


91
00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.999
It’s impossible to take your eyes off
this infinitely dear face.


92
00:22:26.357 --> 00:22:28.418
Your eyes are full of tears,

93
00:22:29.788 --> 00:22:32.827
you hold your breath,

94
00:22:33.827 --> 00:22:36.645
you are overwhelmed with sorrow,

95
00:22:37.396 --> 00:22:42.504
shared by millions,
hundreds of millions of people.


96
00:22:46.894 --> 00:22:48.757
I look and look again.

97
00:22:50.523 --> 00:22:52.819
I won’t stop looking.

98
00:22:55.608 --> 00:23:01.245
For the first time in my life,
with all my heart, with all my mind


99
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:07.793
I grasp this mysterious word:
immortality.


100
00:23:11.234 --> 00:23:12.400
This is it!

101
00:23:13.328 --> 00:23:14.623
Immortality.

102
00:23:22.178 --> 00:23:26.136
It is true –
Joseph Vissarionovich passed away.


103
00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:31.027
It’s true that his heart stopped beating.

104
00:23:31.717 --> 00:23:33.674
His warm and passionate heart.

105
00:23:34.134 --> 00:23:37.784
His heart, devoted to the people.

106
00:23:39.852 --> 00:23:42.980
His motionless head rests on the pillow.

107
00:23:43.948 --> 00:23:46.117
Never again

108
00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:53.726
will a genius thought be born in it.

109
00:23:55.849 --> 00:23:59.019
His lips are sealed tight
under his moustache.


110
00:23:59.995 --> 00:24:02.900
Never again will they utter

111
00:24:03.704 --> 00:24:10.424
his carefully considered words.

112
00:24:13.682 --> 00:24:18.186
And yet – there is no death here!

113
00:24:20.078 --> 00:24:24.146
So many precious thoughts
were born in his genius brain!


114
00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:29.557
So many wise words,
inspiring millions of people,


115
00:24:29.643 --> 00:24:31.455
were uttered by these lips.

116
00:24:32.112 --> 00:24:34.479
So much love!

117
00:24:35.762 --> 00:24:39.854
Overwhelming,
life-giving love for mankind


118
00:24:40.683 --> 00:24:42.361
was given to the world

119
00:24:43.227 --> 00:24:46.283
by this daring and courageous heart,

120
00:24:47.302 --> 00:24:51.737
that there is no room left
for the word “death”!


121
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:56.127
There is no death here!

122
00:24:57.729 --> 00:25:00.537
There is only eternal life!

123
00:25:01.757 --> 00:25:03.337
Immortality!

124
00:25:11.518 --> 00:25:15.130
Stalin’s immortality is in his deeds.

125
00:25:16.952 --> 00:25:19.613
It is in Communism,
that we shall achieve.


126
00:25:20.272 --> 00:25:25.274
We shall certainly achieve it,
for Stalin taught us how to!


127
00:26:23.408 --> 00:26:30.385
People bring more and more wreaths
to the coffin.


128
00:26:32.433 --> 00:26:35.296
A wreath of fresh tulips,

129
00:26:36.057 --> 00:26:41.574
interwoven with
ammodendron and saxaul branches.


130
00:26:43.348 --> 00:26:47.055
A wreath of dark-green fresh branches,

131
00:26:48.152 --> 00:26:51.534
wide and shiny magnolia leaves.

132
00:26:53.733 --> 00:26:56.639
A wreath of heavy,

133
00:26:57.212 --> 00:27:01.832
golden stalks of ripened wheat,

134
00:27:03.212 --> 00:27:09.383
it lies glaring,
decorated with silk ribbons.


135
00:27:11.176 --> 00:27:16.558
A wreath of stainless steel,
bronze and brass.


136
00:27:17.423 --> 00:27:22.780
Pointed palm leaves,
golden arrows of laurels


137
00:27:23.082 --> 00:27:28.291
and mighty bronze
of oak leaves and acorns.


138
00:41:29.335 --> 00:41:35.020
He gave us his advice.
He helped us grow.


139
00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:39.871
He was everywhere.
He was always with us.


140
00:41:40.285 --> 00:41:45.989
Every child knew his name from birth,

141
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:52.602
and cherished it as a keepsake.

142
00:41:53.499 --> 00:41:57.457
His name, which is so dear to us,

143
00:41:57.752 --> 00:41:59.877
which is so dear to all mankind,

144
00:42:00.299 --> 00:42:03.224
his name continues to shine

145
00:42:03.401 --> 00:42:08.874
and to illuminate our road to Communism,

146
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.232
just as it illuminated our entire lives.

147
00:42:12.653 --> 00:42:14.470
This name is immortal.

148
00:42:14.869 --> 00:42:16.950
So long as mankind lives,

149
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.441
it shall be illuminated by the light

150
00:42:22.527 --> 00:42:26.897
of this life-giving and immortal genius.

151
00:42:32.954 --> 00:42:37.060
It’ll take us a long time
to come to terms


152
00:42:38.471 --> 00:42:42.232
with these plain and cruel words:

153
00:42:42.918 --> 00:42:47.731
“Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin’s heart
has stopped beating.”


154
00:42:50.161 --> 00:42:52.065
We were so full of love for him;

155
00:42:52.156 --> 00:42:58.689
our life was enriched with his genius,

156
00:42:59.074 --> 00:43:03.877
which he shared not only with
the millions of compatriots,


157
00:43:04.764 --> 00:43:06.268
but also with the people abroad.

158
00:43:06.359 --> 00:43:09.323
We don’t have the right to be weak.

159
00:43:10.295 --> 00:43:13.802
We are not ashamed of
our tears and of our sorrow.


160
00:43:14.206 --> 00:43:16.436
In our sorrow is the strength of love.

161
00:43:18.547 --> 00:43:23.794
The happiness he gave us,
will stay with us.


162
00:43:24.096 --> 00:43:25.669
It will live in us,

163
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:31.568
just as his beautiful and glorious image
will remain with us forever.


164
00:43:31.994 --> 00:43:34.115
We’ll always remember
his infinite kindness,


165
00:43:34.206 --> 00:43:36.873
the way he cared for our Soviet people.

166
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.963
His selfless love for the Soviet people,

167
00:43:42.054 --> 00:43:45.973
for every single one of us,
will live in us.


168
00:43:46.581 --> 00:43:51.747
The great happiness of building

169
00:43:51.833 --> 00:43:55.477
the universal and the wonderful
happiness of Communism!


170
00:43:56.150 --> 00:44:00.262
We swear by Stalin’s glorious memory,

171
00:44:00.348 --> 00:44:05.685
we promise to our Mother –
the Communist Party –


172
00:44:05.771 --> 00:44:11.959
that our whole life,
our every deed and every thought,


173
00:44:12.192 --> 00:44:14.475
will belong to our great Party,

174
00:44:14.561 --> 00:44:20.152
to its great teachings,
to the great cause of building Communism!


175
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.302
We will remember his every word...

176
00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:30.455
We despise death;
there will be no death...


177
00:44:51.938 --> 00:44:59.984
The man, who brought precious gifts

178
00:45:01.059 --> 00:45:05.154
to millions of people around the world

179
00:45:05.803 --> 00:45:11.062
who turned a human into such a strong,

180
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:15.886
noble and honourable being,

181
00:45:16.108 --> 00:45:20.491
as it has never been seen
in the history of mankind.


182
00:45:21.851 --> 00:45:25.323
It’s not true that
he is no longer with us!


183
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:28.269
He is with us!

184
00:45:28.997 --> 00:45:31.697
In our every deed,

185
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:37.694
in every drop of blood,
that runs through our veins,


186
00:45:38.242 --> 00:45:40.862
in every breath we take,

187
00:45:41.313 --> 00:45:47.664
lives the gift of Stalin,
the gift he gave to humanity,


188
00:45:48.068 --> 00:45:53.866
the way to the great,

189
00:45:53.957 --> 00:45:58.603
bright and universal future –
to Communism!


190
00:46:00.058 --> 00:46:05.150
We address the entire mankind!

191
00:46:05.439 --> 00:46:14.067
Long live the great and invincible
banner of Lenin and Stalin!


192
00:46:14.933 --> 00:46:17.459
Long live Communism,

193
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:24.529
the embodiment
of our leader's eternal life!


194
00:47:11.902 --> 00:47:13.437
You were with us

195
00:47:15.714 --> 00:47:18.028
Through all the wars and hardships,

196
00:47:19.186 --> 00:47:21.965
You nurtured us,
you kept a watchful eye,


197
00:47:23.011 --> 00:47:27.528
Your toast in honour
of the ordinary Russians


198
00:47:28.581 --> 00:47:32.294
Opened up our hearts
and made us laugh and cry.


199
00:47:34.014 --> 00:47:39.717
We celebrated Victory like birthday,
we started our lives as if anew.


200
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.621
You know that true love is never worldly,

201
00:47:44.396 --> 00:47:48.715
But it is as pure as morning dew.

202
00:47:49.573 --> 00:47:51.948
The sun of your ideas shines above us

203
00:47:52.099 --> 00:47:55.291
And Moscow stars are bright
with crimson light


204
00:47:55.634 --> 00:47:58.577
Dear Comrade,
Your every wish is our command,


205
00:47:59.023 --> 00:48:01.742
And we shall work for you,
and we shall fight!


206
00:48:02.537 --> 00:48:05.232
And from my heart
these simple words are coming.


207
00:48:05.494 --> 00:48:08.688
Today I'm very happy to report,

208
00:48:09.313 --> 00:48:12.758
That all mankind is led by Lenin
-Stalin,

209
00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:18.380
And there is no honour
higher in this world.


210
00:48:24.807 --> 00:48:29.727
Comrade Stalin made his way

211
00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:33.231
through the snowy planes of Donbass.

212
00:48:34.359 --> 00:48:39.068
The devastated people heard his voice:

213
00:48:39.151 --> 00:48:44.518
“Hurry to the rescue of Ukraine!”

214
00:48:44.975 --> 00:48:48.115
I can see the miners of Donbass,

215
00:48:48.832 --> 00:48:53.436
thousands of people
who met him in the trenches,


216
00:48:54.578 --> 00:48:56.682
and water-filled mines,

217
00:48:59.253 --> 00:49:01.958
at the destroyed factories.

218
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:04.277
Everywhere he came,

219
00:49:05.534 --> 00:49:08.005
the stars began to shine

220
00:49:10.107 --> 00:49:12.065
and the iron ore began to flow.

221
00:49:13.359 --> 00:49:16.887
He united all the lands of Ukraine.

222
00:49:41.614 --> 00:49:45.750
Young pioneers,
sombre and stern,


223
00:49:46.729 --> 00:49:50.270
salute with their shaking hands.

224
00:49:51.343 --> 00:49:55.761
Their eyes fill with tears,

225
00:49:57.898 --> 00:50:04.890
but their lips whisper an oath,
with confidence and determination,


226
00:50:05.833 --> 00:50:07.011
to Lenin,

227
00:50:07.858 --> 00:50:09.444
to Stalin,

228
00:50:10.378 --> 00:50:13.498
and the Communist Party.

229
00:50:16.234 --> 00:50:18.267
Moscow schoolchildren

230
00:50:18.358 --> 00:50:20.030
as guards of honour

231
00:50:20.876 --> 00:50:24.551
stand at Stalin’s coffin.

232
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:49.183
There’s no end to our pain and sorrow

233
00:51:50.434 --> 00:51:52.301
And no words to utter

234
00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:56.847
how much we grieve,

235
00:51:57.913 --> 00:51:59.186
Oh, Comrade Stalin...

236
00:51:59.884 --> 00:52:00.965
We don’t have words,

237
00:52:02.153 --> 00:52:04.147
But we have hearts to give.

238
00:52:05.085 --> 00:52:08.774
Without words,
in every town or village,


239
00:52:10.144 --> 00:52:13.190
To add one minute to your precious life

240
00:52:14.154 --> 00:52:17.103
We would have given all our blood.

241
00:52:17.886 --> 00:52:20.480
If we could bring together all of them,

242
00:52:21.189 --> 00:52:25.496
All those hearts
with their silent passion,


243
00:52:26.188 --> 00:52:28.092
And give them all to you,

244
00:52:28.521 --> 00:52:31.608
You would have lived
another hundred years,


245
00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:35.485
You would have lived, you would.

246
00:52:36.564 --> 00:52:40.598
But, Comrade Stalin,
you have left us.


247
00:52:41.486 --> 00:52:45.804
And no words to utter pain and grief.

248
00:52:46.754 --> 00:52:51.074
The face of Earth is grey.
Its soul weeps.


249
01:02:48.787 --> 01:02:51.864
In this difficult time for our Party
and for our nation,


250
01:02:52.286 --> 01:02:55.922
the workers of the Kirov Factory
and all the workers of our Motherland,


251
01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.804
unanimously support the measures,
taken by the Party,


252
01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:05.017
aimed at successful implementation
of the policies,


253
01:03:05.134 --> 01:03:08.939
adopted by our Party and the government.

254
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:12.698
Together with the entire Soviet people,
the workers of the Kirov Factory,


255
01:03:12.784 --> 01:03:17.870
join ranks with the Leninist-Stalinist
Central Committee


256
01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:21.390
of the Communist Party
and Soviet government.


257
01:03:22.241 --> 01:03:28.690
We shall dedicate even greater energy
to the Leninist-Stalinist cause


258
01:03:28.781 --> 01:03:31.541
and to the Victory of Communism
in our country!


259
01:03:31.948 --> 01:03:35.713
Our sacrifice and our labour
will become a lasting monument


260
01:03:35.804 --> 01:03:41.505
to our beloved leader and teacher,
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.


261
01:03:44.948 --> 01:03:48.365
The name of
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin


262
01:03:48.456 --> 01:03:53.907
is a symbol of our triumph and joy.

263
01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:58.462
All our endeavours, all our deeds

264
01:03:59.359 --> 01:04:04.596
have been guided and inspired
by the great Stalin.


265
01:04:05.279 --> 01:04:07.543
In these sorrowful hours

266
01:04:07.629 --> 01:04:13.730
when our immortal
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin is gone,


267
01:04:13.971 --> 01:04:20.935
our people join ranks
with the Communist Party,


268
01:04:21.026 --> 01:04:26.508
the Leninist-Stalinist Central Committee,
and our Soviet government.


269
01:04:27.143 --> 01:04:30.470
In response to the appeal
of the Central Committee,


270
01:04:30.556 --> 01:04:35.722
Council of Ministers and the Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR,


271
01:04:35.813 --> 01:04:40.131
we shall display unyielding
fortitude and unity,


272
01:04:40.217 --> 01:04:42.899
we shall intensify
our political vigilance,


273
01:04:42.985 --> 01:04:47.765
we shall dedicate all our energy
to achieve the goals


274
01:04:47.856 --> 01:04:52.727
set by our great Father,
our dearly beloved Stalin.


275
01:04:59.674 --> 01:05:01.067
The workers...

276
01:05:03.932 --> 01:05:07.272
of the Soviet Union
and all the working people


277
01:05:07.998 --> 01:05:10.141
above all, the Communist Party,

278
01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:17.343
have lost our great leader and teacher,

279
01:05:17.434 --> 01:05:18.815
Comrade Stalin.

280
01:05:20.172 --> 01:05:21.607
Dear comrades!

281
01:05:22.675 --> 01:05:24.133
This loss

282
01:05:25.707 --> 01:05:28.389
is in every worker's heart.

283
01:05:29.466 --> 01:05:31.311
Let us not despair!

284
01:05:32.213 --> 01:05:38.433
Let us adhere to the teachings
of the great Stalin!


285
01:05:39.117 --> 01:05:45.189
Let us work as taught by
our great leader, Comrade Stalin.


286
01:05:45.548 --> 01:05:49.654
Forward, comrades!
To the glorious summits of Communism!


287
01:05:56.042 --> 01:05:59.716
The great and loving heart

288
01:05:59.802 --> 01:06:03.955
of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin
has stopped beating.


289
01:06:05.808 --> 01:06:13.597
Joseph Vissarionovich was the dearest
member of our Soviet family.


290
01:06:17.315 --> 01:06:20.933
All the joys, all the hardships
of our lives


291
01:06:22.015 --> 01:06:27.389
we shared with him.

292
01:06:28.214 --> 01:06:35.574
We knew that he was our
devoted guardian and teacher.


293
01:06:35.733 --> 01:06:37.232
Under his guidance,

294
01:06:38.383 --> 01:06:43.645
we have built a wonderful life.

295
01:06:45.798 --> 01:06:46.869
Comrades,

296
01:06:47.582 --> 01:06:49.959
we have lost Joseph Vissarionovich.

297
01:06:51.751 --> 01:06:55.659
His name will remain in our hearts

298
01:06:56.037 --> 01:07:00.361
for as long as blood flows
through our veins.


299
01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:07.415
To the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of the USSR.


300
01:07:08.501 --> 01:07:15.515
Workers, engineers
and general staff


301
01:07:15.606 --> 01:07:20.286
of the Kirov factory,
the holder of four honorary awards,


302
01:07:20.897 --> 01:07:23.157
with the deepest sorrow

303
01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:27.736
and unspeakable pain in our hearts,

304
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:35.523
have learned about the death
of our dearly beloved


305
01:07:35.614 --> 01:07:43.503
leader and teacher,
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.


306
01:07:44.215 --> 01:07:51.984
We shall join ranks with
the Central Committee of our Party!


307
01:07:52.183 --> 01:07:58.510
Workers of the Kirov factory will
intensify their revolutionary vigilance


308
01:07:59.174 --> 01:08:04.480
and relentlessly resist
the enemies' provocations.


309
01:08:04.983 --> 01:08:13.192
Immortal and invincible
are the teachings of Lenin-Stalin!


310
01:08:20.005 --> 01:08:24.819
We shall join ranks

311
01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.759
with the Central Committee of our Party,

312
01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:34.439
we shall intensify our efforts

313
01:08:35.155 --> 01:08:43.814
in order to fulfill
the 5th five-year plan


314
01:08:44.577 --> 01:08:49.279
and to build Communism
in our country!


315
01:08:50.099 --> 01:08:53.860
Immortal and invincible

316
01:08:53.972 --> 01:08:58.571
are the teachings of Lenin
-Stalin!

317
01:23:31.233 --> 01:23:34.259
Moscow calling!

318
01:23:39.053 --> 01:23:44.164
The Pillar Hall
of the House of the Unions.


319
01:23:50.293 --> 01:23:54.351
The ceremony of lying in state

320
01:23:54.994 --> 01:24:01.709
of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin
is about to end.


321
01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:10.079
Members of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of the USSR


322
01:24:10.165 --> 01:24:12.408
have gathered by the coffin.

323
01:24:15.329 --> 01:24:19.528
They are joined by members
of the Funeral Commission,


324
01:24:21.948 --> 01:24:30.045
ministers, marshals and generals
of the Soviet army.


325
01:25:01.146 --> 01:25:09.059
These final minutes
are unbearably painful.


326
01:25:31.244 --> 01:25:33.483
In these final moments of valediction,

327
01:25:34.369 --> 01:25:40.109
the depth of misery,
which has stricken our country


328
01:25:40.195 --> 01:25:44.152
is particularly vivid.

329
01:26:02.248 --> 01:26:05.660
Party and government officials,

330
01:26:07.146 --> 01:26:10.935
members of the Funeral Commission,

331
01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:14.873
approach the pedestal,

332
01:26:20.635 --> 01:26:24.380
lift up the coffin

333
01:26:25.192 --> 01:26:29.048
with the body
of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin


334
01:26:31.473 --> 01:26:40.848
and slowly proceed towards
the exit of the Pillar Hall.


335
01:42:17.393 --> 01:42:23.809
On behalf of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party


336
01:42:23.895 --> 01:42:26.882
and Council of Ministers of the USSR,

337
01:42:26.973 --> 01:42:29.488
I declare open the memorial gathering

338
01:42:29.574 --> 01:42:33.455
in honour of the Chairman of Council
of Ministers of the USSR,


339
01:42:33.895 --> 01:42:39.562
the Secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of the USSR,


340
01:42:39.812 --> 01:42:46.257
Generalissimus
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.


341
01:42:48.461 --> 01:42:55.149
The floor is given to the Chairman
of Council of Ministers of the USSR,


342
01:42:55.345 --> 01:43:00.806
the Secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of the USSR,


343
01:43:01.095 --> 01:43:05.470
Comrade Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov.

344
01:43:10.345 --> 01:43:16.033
Dear compatriots, comrades and friends!

345
01:43:17.223 --> 01:43:20.671
Dear foreign brothers!

346
01:43:22.097 --> 01:43:28.555
Our Party, the Soviet people
and the entire mankind


347
01:43:29.461 --> 01:43:35.306
have suffered a terrible,
irreplaceable loss.


348
01:43:36.711 --> 01:43:41.795
The glorious life
of our teacher and leader,


349
01:43:42.336 --> 01:43:49.995
of the greatest genius
in the history of mankind,


350
01:43:50.086 --> 01:43:54.176
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin has ended.

351
01:43:55.461 --> 01:44:01.209
During these days of mourning,
our sorrow is shared by


352
01:44:01.295 --> 01:44:06.388
progressively minded people
all over the world.


353
01:44:07.937 --> 01:44:12.774
The greatness and the importance

354
01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:16.881
of Comrade Stalin’s deeds are immense

355
01:44:16.967 --> 01:44:23.140
in the eyes of the Soviet people
and the workers of the entire world.


356
01:44:24.295 --> 01:44:29.182
Stalin’s deeds will live forever,

357
01:44:29.981 --> 01:44:35.565
and future generations,
full of gratitude, as we do now,


358
01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:40.349
will hail Stalin’s name.

359
01:44:40.974 --> 01:44:45.153
Comrade Stalin dedicated his life

360
01:44:45.244 --> 01:44:51.994
to the cause of the liberation
of the proletariat and working people


361
01:44:52.561 --> 01:44:56.170
from exploitation by the oppressors;

362
01:44:56.730 --> 01:45:02.973
to the cause of ridding humankind
of devastating wars;


363
01:45:03.729 --> 01:45:12.219
to the cause of achieving
happy and free life on Earth


364
01:45:12.305 --> 01:45:14.717
for the working people.

365
01:45:15.632 --> 01:45:20.966
Stalin succeeded in finding a solution

366
01:45:21.052 --> 01:45:25.180
for one of the most complex problems

367
01:45:25.266 --> 01:45:28.685
in the history of development
of human society –


368
01:45:28.771 --> 01:45:31.128
the national question.

369
01:45:32.128 --> 01:45:36.539
Having developed the greatest national
question theory,


370
01:45:36.710 --> 01:45:39.776
for the first time in history,

371
01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:48.674
Comrade Stalin eliminated
centuries-long ethnic hostility


372
01:45:48.757 --> 01:45:53.418
within the boundaries
of our vast, multiethnic state.


373
01:45:54.546 --> 01:46:00.405
As a result of Comrade Stalin’s
tireless toils,


374
01:46:00.496 --> 01:46:02.865
according to his plans,

375
01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:08.740
our Party managed to transform
a backward country


376
01:46:08.826 --> 01:46:13.073
into a powerful, industrially
and agriculturally developed state;


377
01:46:13.473 --> 01:46:17.357
it established a new economic order,

378
01:46:18.137 --> 01:46:21.911
free of economic depressions
and unemployment.


379
01:46:22.575 --> 01:46:31.225
Our sacred duty is to ensure
further development


380
01:46:31.311 --> 01:46:33.811
of our socialist Motherland.

381
01:46:34.277 --> 01:46:40.066
We must make every effort
to develop socialist industry,


382
01:46:40.157 --> 01:46:44.994
the stronghold of our country’s
power and strength.


383
01:46:45.085 --> 01:46:50.326
We must make every effort
to strengthen collective farms:


384
01:46:50.417 --> 01:46:54.354
to achieve prosperity and development

385
01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:57.525
of all the collective farms
of our Soviet country.


386
01:46:57.611 --> 01:47:03.319
We must strengthen the union between
workers and peasants.


387
01:47:04.163 --> 01:47:08.439
People from all over the world
know Comrade Stalin,


388
01:47:08.530 --> 01:47:11.774
as the greatest torchbearer
for the cause of world peace.


389
01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:19.815
Comrade Stalin dedicated
the power of his genius


390
01:47:20.404 --> 01:47:25.579
to safeguarding peace
for the people of all countries.


391
01:47:26.925 --> 01:47:31.156
Soviet foreign policy,

392
01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:35.427
the policy of peace
and friendship between nations,


393
01:47:35.576 --> 01:47:41.734
is crucial for restraining
foreign military aggression,


394
01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:45.882
and it is conducted
in the best interests of all nations.


395
01:47:48.392 --> 01:47:52.247
The great Stalin taught us

396
01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:55.972
to serve the people,

397
01:47:56.058 --> 01:47:58.844
to be devoted
to the interests of the people.


398
01:48:00.264 --> 01:48:03.428
We are faithful servants of the people.

399
01:48:04.046 --> 01:48:08.781
The people want peace and hate war.

400
01:48:10.491 --> 01:48:16.653
We hold sacred the people’s desire

401
01:48:17.145 --> 01:48:22.099
to prevent bloodshed
and the deaths of millions,


402
01:48:22.185 --> 01:48:28.628
to secure peaceful progress
to happiness.


403
01:48:31.007 --> 01:48:34.118
Farewell, our teacher and leader,

404
01:48:34.485 --> 01:48:38.404
our dear friend, 
Comrade Stalin!

405
01:48:39.684 --> 01:48:43.821
Let’s move forward
to achieve complete triumph


406
01:48:43.912 --> 01:48:47.683
of the cause of Lenin
-Stalin!

407
01:48:58.178 --> 01:49:07.904
The floor is given to the First Deputy
Chairman of Council of Ministers,


408
01:49:08.103 --> 01:49:12.154
Comrade Lavrenty Pavlovich Beria.

409
01:49:19.338 --> 01:49:21.799
Dear comrades and friends!

410
01:49:23.218 --> 01:49:27.931
It’s hard to express the feeling
of deepest sorrow,


411
01:49:28.866 --> 01:49:31.283
which is felt by our Party,

412
01:49:31.883 --> 01:49:35.632
by the peoples of our country

413
01:49:36.756 --> 01:49:39.149
and by all progressively minded
people in the world.


414
01:49:40.122 --> 01:49:42.722
Stalin is no more...

415
01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:49.914
The great comrade-in-arms
and visionary follower of Lenin’s cause.


416
01:49:51.190 --> 01:49:59.297
The man, nearest and dearest
to all the Soviet people,


417
01:50:00.199 --> 01:50:03.086
and to millions of workers
across the world, has left us.


418
01:50:04.026 --> 01:50:05.109
Comrades!

419
01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:08.713
Our heartache cannot be relieved,

420
01:50:09.415 --> 01:50:11.907
our loss is enormous...

421
01:50:12.818 --> 01:50:21.654
But the steel will of the Communist Party
won’t be broken;


422
01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.947
its unity won’t be shaken,

423
01:50:25.561 --> 01:50:29.685
its struggle for Communism will continue!

424
01:50:31.486 --> 01:50:36.078
This is why the people
of the Soviet Union


425
01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:46.448
may fully rely on the Communist Party,

426
01:50:47.412 --> 01:50:52.246
its Central Committee
and the Soviet government.


427
01:50:54.474 --> 01:50:57.295
Enemies of the Soviet state

428
01:50:57.767 --> 01:51:05.025
expect that our tragic loss

429
01:51:05.754 --> 01:51:11.407
will cause chaos and confusion
in our ranks.


430
01:51:13.004 --> 01:51:14.872
They are scheming in vain!

431
01:51:15.517 --> 01:51:18.998
Bitter disappointment awaits them!

432
01:51:21.466 --> 01:51:24.971
Those who have eyes to see,

433
01:51:25.450 --> 01:51:30.507
see that in times of hardships

434
01:51:31.336 --> 01:51:34.389
our Party is more united than ever,

435
01:51:35.706 --> 01:51:38.817
it cannot be broken or shaken.

436
01:51:40.699 --> 01:51:47.457
Our great leaders, Lenin and Stalin,
taught us


437
01:51:48.238 --> 01:51:52.238
to raise the Party’s
and the people’s vigilance


438
01:51:52.322 --> 01:51:53.932
and to safeguard the country

439
01:51:54.713 --> 01:51:59.683
against the ill-doings
of the enemies of the Soviet state.


440
01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:04.934
We have to be even more vigilant now!

441
01:52:05.905 --> 01:52:08.200
We mustn’t let anyone think

442
01:52:08.974 --> 01:52:16.799
that the enemies of the Soviet state
can catch us unaware.


443
01:52:18.047 --> 01:52:22.175
The strength of our state

444
01:52:22.261 --> 01:52:26.286
is not only in its victorious,

445
01:52:26.372 --> 01:52:31.785
battle-seasoned and heroic army;

446
01:52:31.957 --> 01:52:35.835
the might of the Soviet state

447
01:52:35.926 --> 01:52:39.207
is in the unity of the Soviet people,

448
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:42.772
in their trust in the Communist Party,

449
01:52:43.292 --> 01:52:46.241
the leading force of Soviet society;

450
01:52:46.769 --> 01:52:50.207
it’s in the people’s trust
in its Soviet government.


451
01:52:50.563 --> 01:52:54.978
The Soviet people
have unanimously approved


452
01:52:55.069 --> 01:52:59.444
the decree
of the Central Committee of our Party,


453
01:53:00.049 --> 01:53:02.903
Council of Ministers and the Presidium

454
01:53:02.989 --> 01:53:05.412
of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR

455
01:53:05.498 --> 01:53:08.668
on adopting of a number
of important measures


456
01:53:08.754 --> 01:53:15.443
aimed at ensuring
continuous and efficient


457
01:53:15.529 --> 01:53:18.117
governance of our country.

458
01:53:19.230 --> 01:53:23.769
One of these important measures

459
01:53:23.855 --> 01:53:30.738
was the appointment
of Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov,


460
01:53:31.741 --> 01:53:38.966
Lenin’s gifted disciple
and Stalin’s comrade-in-arms,


461
01:53:39.281 --> 01:53:42.530
to the position of the Chairman
of Council of Ministers of the USSR.


462
01:53:43.973 --> 01:53:49.346
The nations of our country
may rest assured


463
01:53:49.928 --> 01:53:56.053
that the Communist Party
and the Soviet government


464
01:53:57.009 --> 01:54:01.987
will work relentlessly
and will dedicated their lives


465
01:54:02.078 --> 01:54:09.723
to the cause of maintaining the unity
in the Party ranks,


466
01:54:10.743 --> 01:54:15.888
to strengthen friendship
between nations of the USSR,


467
01:54:16.707 --> 01:54:19.832
to increase the power
of the Soviet state,


468
01:54:20.557 --> 01:54:27.587
to remain true to the ideas
of Marxism and Leninism,


469
01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:32.978
and, in accordance with he legacy
of Lenin and Stalin,


470
01:54:33.461 --> 01:54:37.055
to lead the Socialist state to Communism!

471
01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:44.091
Glory to our dearly beloved

472
01:54:44.665 --> 01:54:48.165
leader and teacher,

473
01:54:48.749 --> 01:54:50.894
to the great Stalin!

474
01:54:54.185 --> 01:54:58.734
The floor is given to the First Deputy

475
01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:03.724
Chairman of Council of Ministers
of the USSR,


476
01:55:03.810 --> 01:55:07.736
Comrade Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov.

477
01:55:12.067 --> 01:55:15.192
Dear comrades and friends!

478
01:55:17.153 --> 01:55:23.658
We are all grieving

479
01:55:25.383 --> 01:55:29.383
the loss of
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.


480
01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.274
The departure of the great leader,

481
01:55:34.182 --> 01:55:43.228
but also, a close and dear person.

482
01:55:46.059 --> 01:55:50.831
As his old and close friends,

483
01:55:51.939 --> 01:55:56.239
all of us, millions of Soviet people,

484
01:55:57.606 --> 01:56:03.605
workers in all the countries,
all over the world


485
01:56:04.933 --> 01:56:10.172
we are bidding farewell to Stalin,

486
01:56:11.017 --> 01:56:13.814
who we loved so dearly

487
01:56:15.146 --> 01:56:19.042
and who will always
remain in our hearts.


488
01:56:20.021 --> 01:56:27.481
Stalin is the great follower
of the great cause of Lenin!


489
01:56:29.876 --> 01:56:33.522
Under the leadership
of the Communist Party,


490
01:56:34.936 --> 01:56:38.329
headed by Comrade Stalin,

491
01:56:39.603 --> 01:56:47.288
the Soviet people
built Socialism in our country.


492
01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:52.124
And initiated

493
01:56:53.022 --> 01:56:55.084
the realisation of the programme

494
01:56:55.989 --> 01:56:58.459
of achieving constant growth

495
01:56:59.267 --> 01:57:01.893
in economic welfare

496
01:57:02.852 --> 01:57:05.297
and cultural development

497
01:57:06.241 --> 01:57:07.887
of the Soviet nation.

498
01:57:09.911 --> 01:57:13.669
They achieved a historic victory

499
01:57:14.818 --> 01:57:16.433
over fascism

500
01:57:17.324 --> 01:57:19.450
in World War II.

501
01:57:24.716 --> 01:57:31.424
Long live the great and victorious

502
01:57:32.134 --> 01:57:37.615
teachings of
of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin!


503
01:57:38.592 --> 01:57:45.041
Long live our mighty
Socialist Motherland,


504
01:57:45.485 --> 01:57:48.958
our heroic Soviet people!

505
01:57:50.110 --> 01:57:57.502
Long live the great
Communist Party of the Soviet Union!


506
01:58:03.694 --> 01:58:05.333
The memorial gathering

507
01:58:05.940 --> 01:58:12.065

of Council of Ministers of the USSR,


508
01:58:12.482 --> 01:58:18.474

511
02:07:44.644 --> 02:07:49.811
Moonlight above us shines so brightly

512
02:07:50.228 --> 02:07:55.107
Evening has knocked at our door,

513
02:07:56.451 --> 02:08:02.258
All little birdies and all little babies,

514
02:08:02.716 --> 02:08:06.654
Go to bed at this hour

515
02:08:09.355 --> 02:08:11.946
My little boy

516
02:08:12.363 --> 02:08:15.824
Will wake up tomorrow,

517
02:08:16.355 --> 02:08:20.783
Welcoming glorious day,

518
02:08:23.308 --> 02:08:27.069
Sleep tight, my sparrow,

519
02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:33.258
Sleep tight, my baby,

520
02:08:33.499 --> 02:08:38.435
Hush, my dear jingle bell

521
02:08:54.232 --> 02:09:00.619
Sleep, my beloved,
my sweet little birdie,


522
02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:05.717
Lull – la – la – lullaby,

523
02:09:08.573 --> 02:09:14.602
Let no sorrow, let no evil,

524
02:09:15.522 --> 02:09:20.858
Trouble your innocent soul

525
02:09:22.911 --> 02:09:31.943
From grief and from torture
you will be spared,


526
02:09:32.374 --> 02:09:37.247
Destined for life full of joy,

527
02:09:40.161 --> 02:09:44.317
Sleep tight, my sparrow,

528
02:09:44.687 --> 02:09:50.392
Sleep tight, my baby,

529
02:09:51.511 --> 02:09:57.166
Hush, my dear jingle bell

530
02:10:13.261 --> 02:10:19.323
Sleep tight, my little one,
carefree and happy,


531
02:10:19.735 --> 02:10:23.197
Years will fly by,

532
02:10:25.852 --> 02:10:32.173
As a young eagle,
fearless and handsome


533
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:37.594
You’ll fly away from our nest

534
02:10:39.854 --> 02:10:48.784
You will be nourished,
you will be guided


535
02:10:49.167 --> 02:10:55.144
By Stalin’s almighty hand

536
02:10:57.722 --> 02:11:02.481
Sleep tight, my sparrow,

537
02:11:02.908 --> 02:11:10.059
Sleep tight, my baby,

538
02:11:11.418 --> 02:11:18.262
Hush, my dear jingle bell
