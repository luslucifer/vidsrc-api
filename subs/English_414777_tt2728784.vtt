[male newscaster] More than a dozen new
dark spots on the surface of the sun.

NASA's Joint Agency
Satellite Division director,


3
00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:05.543
who has now made the data and
observations available to the media,


4
00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:08.023
has confirmed the severity
of this new data


5
00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.200
and what this means.

6
00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:12.767
[female newscaster] The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA,


7
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:15.248
has released new images
of our sun,


8
00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:18.904
and the irregular solar
activity has not only continued


9
00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:20.775
but seems to have intensified.

10
00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.300
This means we could be headed
into a dark period.


11
00:01:23.343 --> 00:01:25.040
[female newscaster 2]
Governments across the world


12
00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.652
now admitting that these
now coined "solar collapses"


13
00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:29.131
that have been recorded
in the past months


14
00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:31.612
are literally
shutting down our sun.


15
00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:35.007
The ecological and social impact
already being felt around the world:


16
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.791
global temperatures
rapidly decreasing


17
00:01:36.835 --> 00:01:38.402
and unrest rapidly increasing.

18
00:01:38.837 --> 00:01:40.186
Many thinking to have...

[air hissing]

22
00:02:26.014 --> 00:02:27.973
[man on radio] What scientists
think is really happening


23
00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:31.498
is that most of the solar cycles
have two curves, and not only one.


24
00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:33.674
What they think
is going to happen


25
00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:36.851
is that solar activity will
eventually increase and pick up again.


26
00:02:37.678 --> 00:02:41.639
What we have to fear most as of now is the
unrest that is spreading across the world.


27
00:02:41.682 --> 00:02:43.641
It is important that
we all try to remain calm


28
00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:45.077
and trust that there will be...

29
00:02:47.558 --> 00:02:49.081
I brought these in
from the city.


30
00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:51.736
Thought it would make the
house feel more comfortable.


31
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:53.825
Gina.

32
00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.613
Your mouth.

33
00:03:00.614 --> 00:03:01.572
You're slipping again.

34
00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:24.638
Thank you.

35
00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:26.988
Don't make yourself
too comfortable.


36
00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:28.860
It shouldn't be long.

37
00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.260
Shit.

38
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:46.094
Fuck.

Get in!

43
00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:05.984
Hi, Bean.

44
00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:10.554
[girl] Ray? What's gonna happen?

45
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:12.382
[Ray] What do you think
is gonna happen?


46
00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.820
Dad said everything
will be fine.


47
00:04:17.822 --> 00:04:20.302
That they're coming to get us, and
they're going to take us to the caves.


48
00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:23.088
Where it's safe and warm.

[kisses]Mmm.

52
00:04:56.513 --> 00:04:58.428
It's so long. I like it.

53
00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:01.866
Yours is growing nicely.

54
00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:05.043
Well...

55
00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:07.088
Your room's all ready.

56
00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:10.135
You should clean up
before you see him.


57
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.746
Come. I'll be in in a minute.

Hello.

Yes, hello, this is, uh, Raymond
Beaty calling for Senator--


65
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.973
Hello?

66
00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:50.714
Hello, can you hear me?

67
00:06:52.193 --> 00:06:53.630
Yes, it's Raymond Beaty,
I'm calling for Senator Thorn.

00:06:55.022 --> 00:06:55.675
Yeah-
- What?

69
00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:57.242
No, I can't hear you.

70
00:06:59.723 --> 00:07:02.334
Yeah. Yes. Yes, you said
that to me yesterday.

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:03.814
But um...

72
00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:06.207
All right, just leave
a message, will you?


73
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.992
Tell him that
we're all ready here.

We-
- Yes. We're ready to go.

Yes, it's Raymond Beaty again.

Yes, he--

00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:31.755
Bean, I love.

81
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.324
You know, you can't
call me that.


82
00:07:37.804 --> 00:07:38.936
I'm not a kid anymore.

83
00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:40.590
I can see that.

84
00:07:43.636 --> 00:07:44.942
But you know,
I don't think you need it.


85
00:07:46.944 --> 00:07:47.727
You're a natural beauty.

00:07:50.164 --> 00:07:51.209
Hey, look at me.

87
00:07:57.694 --> 00:07:58.346
Will we be all right?

88
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:00.653
I don't know.

I'm scared.

94

It's okay.

Did you know that the sun's rays
take eight minutes to reach here?

Earth.

100
00:09:02.236 --> 00:09:03.324
I read that somewhere.

[laughs]

102
00:09:07.764 --> 00:09:09.461
You remind me so much
of your mother sometimes.


103
00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:12.638
Have I told you that before?

104
00:09:16.686 --> 00:09:17.469
I need you, Raymond.

105
00:09:20.124 --> 00:09:21.342
I need you to grow up.

If we're gonna survive this,

107
00:09:25.172 --> 00:09:27.522
your brother and I need you to
be the man I know you can be.


108
00:09:29.786 --> 00:09:31.962
I think we need to think a
little bit more realistically


109
00:09:32.005 --> 00:09:33.093
about what's going
on here, Dad.


110
00:09:35.095 --> 00:09:35.879
About what's happening.

111
00:09:36.923 --> 00:09:38.011
About these caves.

112
00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:45.323

Sorry.

118
00:10:40.334 --> 00:10:41.640
I made pot pie for dinner.

119
00:10:42.772 --> 00:10:43.773
You still like pot pie,
don't you?


120
00:10:44.948 --> 00:10:45.818
Um...

121
00:10:47.864 --> 00:10:48.647
Darling?

122
00:10:49.256 --> 00:10:50.301
You needed something?

123
00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:53.391
Yeah, uh, Fred just showed up.
He's here.


124
00:10:54.914 --> 00:10:55.741
He brought someone.

125

[softly] One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

Oh.

128
00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:09.363
She's been moving
a lot lately.[chuckles]


129
00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:10.712
Oh, wow, so it's a girl?

130
00:11:12.236 --> 00:11:13.019
Do you have a name?

131
00:11:13.585 --> 00:11:14.194
Claudine.

132
00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:15.805
It was my grandmother's name.

133
00:11:17.023 --> 00:11:18.982
That's pretty.[Clara] She kicked!

134
00:11:19.373 --> 00:11:20.635
[laughs] I felt it.

135
00:11:23.203 --> 00:11:24.248
I felt it.

136
00:11:25.945 --> 00:11:26.772
Look at this table.

137
00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:29.601
We certainly have
a lot to celebrate.


138
00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:33.126
It feels good to be back
home again, doesn't it?


139
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:39.132
You have a beautiful home,
Mr. Beaty.


140
00:11:39.654 --> 00:11:40.786
Oh, well, you should
see it in the fall.


141
00:11:41.395 --> 00:11:42.396
Quail season.

142

[woman] Has it been
in your family for a long time?


143
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:49.534
No. I built this myself.
[scoffs]


144
00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:51.449
You know, when I was young,

145
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.714
the word "inheritance" wasn't a
word that existed in my vocabulary.


146
00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:59.892
It's funny that now
it seems to become ubiquitous


147
00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:01.633
in the vocabulary
of modern youth.


148
00:12:04.375 --> 00:12:09.206
No, my father thought it was better
to rely on dumb luck or faith,


149
00:12:09.554 --> 00:12:10.685
whatever you want to call it.

He gambled away
all the money he earned

selling shoes

152
00:12:14.907 --> 00:12:15.952
to people who were
better than him.


153
00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:19.999
Shoes to people who would walk
more interesting paths


154
00:12:20.043 --> 00:12:21.522
than he ever dreamed of.

155
00:12:21.566 --> 00:12:22.872
Shoes people wore to work.

156
00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:26.179
[chuckles] Work.

157
00:12:27.398 --> 00:12:28.747
That's a word that seems
to have disappeared.


158
00:12:29.487 --> 00:12:30.836
None for me, thank you.

159
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.229
Oh, come on, a little bit
won't hurt the baby.


160
00:12:32.272 --> 00:12:33.317
It's an '86.

161
00:12:34.318 --> 00:12:35.667
No one refuses an '86.

162
00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:37.756
Let's have a toast.

163
00:12:39.323 --> 00:12:41.847
To the Beatys, together again.

164
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.719
And then some.

165
00:12:45.546 --> 00:12:47.244
[all] Cheers.

166
00:12:51.988 --> 00:12:54.294
[Ray] So, where did you
two lovebirds meet?


167
00:12:55.426 --> 00:12:57.384
Oh. [chuckles]

168
00:12:57.428 --> 00:13:00.474
Um, Margot led this psychology
lecture at the university


169
00:13:00.518 --> 00:13:01.736
that just blew everybody away.

170
00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:03.738
She blew me away.

171
00:13:05.871 --> 00:13:07.829
You should have seen it, there
were so many guys after her,


172
00:13:07.873 --> 00:13:09.527
I practically had
to fight them off.


173
00:13:09.875 --> 00:13:11.529
- [laughs]
- [laughs] What?


174
00:13:12.399 --> 00:13:13.357
That's not true.

175
00:13:14.488 --> 00:13:15.925
It took months
for you to talk to me.


176
00:13:17.013 --> 00:13:18.666
He would just follow me

177
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.320
and then run away whenever
I looked at him. [chuckles]


178
00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:23.802
[Raymond]
Let me ask you a question.


179
00:13:26.413 --> 00:13:28.328
What do you intend
to do about this?


180
00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:35.335
When the baby comes, and judging from
your size, that will be relatively soon,


181
00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:38.208
when the baby comes, there will
be no hospitals or doctors.


182
00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:39.426
So, how do you intend
to have it?


183
00:13:41.037 --> 00:13:43.300
And once it's born,
how do you intend to raise it


184
00:13:43.343 --> 00:13:46.651
in a world where only the
strong survive, the weak perish?


185
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.220
Have either of you thought
for one minute...


186
00:13:51.786 --> 00:13:54.180
about the repercussions of
your irresponsible behavior?


187
00:13:54.224 --> 00:13:56.008
[Ray laughs]

188
00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:57.792
[clears throat]

189
00:13:59.707 --> 00:14:00.839
It's really good to be home.

190
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:15.114

[beeping]

192
00:14:31.565 --> 00:14:32.871
When are they coming
for us, Fred?


193
00:14:45.449 --> 00:14:49.105
I'm gonna prove to you
that I can take care of you.


194
00:14:53.239 --> 00:14:54.023
I love you.

195
00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:10.256
[beeps]

Awake? Hmm.

200
00:16:40.216 --> 00:16:41.130
Up and at 'em, okay?

201
00:16:41.826 --> 00:16:42.827
Breakfast.

202
00:16:47.614 --> 00:16:48.876
We're gonna be okay.

203
00:16:56.319 --> 00:16:57.494
Your hair looks pretty.

204
00:16:58.669 --> 00:16:59.713
Okay.

205
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.848
Is it gonna start
getting cold?


206
00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:05.980
We have plenty of heat.

207
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:07.808
We have plenty of warmth.

208
00:17:09.114 --> 00:17:09.897
Okay?

209
00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:13.988
[muffled crying]

210
00:17:30.918 --> 00:17:31.789
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:34.444 --> 00:17:35.227
Breakfast is ready.

212
00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:45.846
[shaky breathing]

213
00:17:47.326 --> 00:17:48.327
Thank you.

214
00:17:51.287 --> 00:17:52.462
Is he going to stay up there
all day again?


215
00:17:55.247 --> 00:17:56.814
I'll go check on him.Ah.

216
00:17:56.857 --> 00:17:57.902
How good of you to join us.

217
00:18:05.518 --> 00:18:06.867
What? You guys don't
know what today is?


218
00:18:07.868 --> 00:18:09.435
What day is it?

219
00:18:09.479 --> 00:18:12.221
Well, my dear sister, today
is the first day of spring.


220
00:18:14.179 --> 00:18:15.659
The flowers have bloomed,
the birds are singing,


221
00:18:15.702 --> 00:18:16.486
and the sun is shining.

222
00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:17.878
[dog barking]

223
00:18:18.705 --> 00:18:19.489
He's barking again.

224
00:18:20.664 --> 00:18:21.708
Maybe he needs help.

225
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:24.842
You've gotta eat something.

226
00:18:25.886 --> 00:18:27.018
You're gonna hurt
the baby if you don't.


227
00:18:29.934 --> 00:18:31.501
Darling, please eat something.

228
00:18:31.936 --> 00:18:34.112
Fred, I found that old axe
in the basement.


229
00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:37.376
Maybe you and I could go and
chop some wood after breakfast.


230
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.552
Yeah, that's fine--I'm sorry,
I can't do this anymore.


231
00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:41.946
When are they coming for us?

232
00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:46.124
Please, for God's sake!

233
00:18:47.647 --> 00:18:49.170
Dad, I'm sorry--No, no. Fred, it's okay.
It's all right.


234
00:18:49.475 --> 00:18:51.216
She's just worried
about her survival.


235
00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.566
To be honest, I'd be
concerned if she weren't.


236
00:18:55.699 --> 00:18:57.091
Do you pray at night, Margot?

237
00:18:59.442 --> 00:19:01.182
I've never been
a man of faith myself.


238
00:19:01.922 --> 00:19:03.272
I'm a practical man.

239
00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.624
I think life is simple. If you live a
life of integrity and responsibility,


240
00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:08.451
then you're rewarded.

241
00:19:09.016 --> 00:19:10.540
My conscious is clear.

242
00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:12.933
You can't do this anymore?

243
00:19:14.587 --> 00:19:15.893
Well, there's the door.

244
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.461
And nobody's going to stop you
and I'm sure God will go with you.


245
00:19:19.723 --> 00:19:21.942
They'll come for us
when they come for us,


246
00:19:21.986 --> 00:19:25.032
and my family will wait
as long as we have to.


247
00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:29.994
You're lying. Margot, please...

248
00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:31.691
Who do you think you are?

249
00:19:33.432 --> 00:19:35.042
- Just because you found your
golden ticket, -What are you--


250
00:19:35.086 --> 00:19:37.044
you think you can come into
my house and call me a liar?


251
00:19:38.002 --> 00:19:40.918
You sit here,
eat my food in my house.


252

Who do you think you are?

Too freakin' sunny in here.

258

[Margot] I can't be
here one more second.


259
00:20:27.094 --> 00:20:28.139
We're safe here.

260
00:20:29.532 --> 00:20:30.707
It's freezing outside--

261
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.056
I want to go home!

262

I want to call my family!

263
00:20:34.406 --> 00:20:36.365
I want to use the house phone!

264
00:20:36.843 --> 00:20:38.497
We're waiting for someone
to come get us. When?


265
00:20:39.455 --> 00:20:41.805
You promised me we'd be safe.

266
00:20:41.848 --> 00:20:43.894
There's just other people
they have to pick up first.


267
00:20:43.937 --> 00:20:45.112
We have to wait.

We are just waiting for death.

Hey, we are not
just waiting for death, okay?


271
00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.302
We're waiting for her.

272
00:21:03.957 --> 00:21:06.133
When she comes,
everything will be better.


273
00:21:14.098 --> 00:21:15.142
She's safe.

You know, you're pretty
good at this.

Abbey used to do it to me.

She wore it all the time.

283

I think that's why boys
liked her so much.

Who's Abbey?

You can't go in there.

She was my sister.

She died five years ago.

what it would be like...


498
00:40:09.798 --> 00:40:10.581
to have her.

499
00:40:13.802 --> 00:40:14.716
It's silly.

500
00:40:19.024 --> 00:40:20.069
Why did you leave?

501
00:40:23.246 --> 00:40:25.378
I just couldn't deal anymore, you know?
I couldn't...


502
00:40:28.947 --> 00:40:30.079
With everything that happened.

503
00:40:31.559 --> 00:40:32.821
I heard about your sister.

504
00:40:35.824 --> 00:40:36.607
I'm sorry.

505
00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:41.438
[clears throat] Yeah, well,
that was a long time ago.


506
00:40:43.614 --> 00:40:44.963
Yeah. It's late.
I'm gonna actually...


507
00:40:46.182 --> 00:40:47.400
try and get some sleep.

508
00:40:49.707 --> 00:40:50.752
What happened to her?

509
00:40:56.105 --> 00:40:57.367
Our father killed her.

510
00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:06.942
[clears throat][beeps]

511
00:41:13.949 --> 00:41:14.863
[sighs]

512
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.004
I love you, too.

513
00:41:28.528 --> 00:41:29.617
I miss you so much.

514
00:41:31.096 --> 00:41:32.707
Every night I go outside

515
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.361
and I look up at the stars
like we used to.


516
00:41:38.147 --> 00:41:39.496
I don't know if I can do this.

517
00:41:42.978 --> 00:41:46.242
It's... This is way
worse than I remember.


518
00:41:51.029 --> 00:41:52.030
I can't.

519
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.423
No, I can't.

520
00:41:56.034 --> 00:41:57.514
They're still my family.

521
00:41:57.775 --> 00:41:59.385
I need to be here for Clara.
She needs me.


522
00:42:00.735 --> 00:42:01.736
I can't leave her again.

523
00:42:04.434 --> 00:42:05.435
[beeps]

524
00:42:05.478 --> 00:42:07.785
This is not to be used...
by anyone.


525
00:42:09.004 --> 00:42:10.048
Understood?

526
00:42:13.443 --> 00:42:15.358
At least you had the good sense
not to bring her here with you.


527
00:42:15.924 --> 00:42:18.317
Well, nobody deserves
to spend their last days here.


528
00:42:52.525 --> 00:42:54.440
[Raymond] You, my dear,
are nothing!


529
00:42:54.876 --> 00:42:55.964
You're nothing!

530
00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:57.226
You do not exist!

531
00:42:57.269 --> 00:42:59.707
Do you understand me?
You don't exist!


532
00:43:33.088 --> 00:43:34.132
She's here.

533
00:43:40.748 --> 00:43:41.487
Come on now, Gina.

534
00:43:42.662 --> 00:43:43.794
You better get
a start on dinner.


535
00:43:45.448 --> 00:43:46.623
She's always been here.

536
00:43:47.015 --> 00:43:48.581
No. She hasn't.

537
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.062
Abbey is dead. 
You know that.

538
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.455
No.

539
00:43:53.848 --> 00:43:54.892
No.

540
00:43:57.939 --> 00:43:59.288
Don't fall apart on me now.

541
00:44:01.377 --> 00:44:02.421
We're almost there.

542
00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:06.556
Why didn't we help her?

543
00:44:09.167 --> 00:44:11.779
Why didn't we understand?
She was just a child.


544
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:22.833
You don't even care.

545
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.923
You think I don't miss her?

546
00:44:25.967 --> 00:44:27.882
You think I don't think
about her every single day?


547
00:44:27.925 --> 00:44:29.971
Then why didn't you
let me go after her?


548
00:44:30.014 --> 00:44:31.233
Why did you stop me?

549
00:44:35.585 --> 00:44:36.629
Take your medicine. 
I don't want it.

550
00:44:36.673 --> 00:44:38.675
- Take your medicine!
- No! No!


551
00:44:38.718 --> 00:44:39.807
Gina, take your medicine!

552
00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:40.808
It's all your fault!

553
00:44:41.025 --> 00:44:42.592
[gasps] It's all your fault!

554
00:44:43.245 --> 00:44:44.768
No, it's your fault!

555
00:44:44.812 --> 00:44:45.856
It's your fault!

556
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.162
You couldn't take care of her.

557
00:44:47.205 --> 00:44:48.424
Look at you!

558
00:44:49.904 --> 00:44:51.340
Look at you now. You can't
even take care of yourself.


559
00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:53.168
[whimpers]

560
00:44:59.174 --> 00:45:01.306
I can't take care
of our family without you.


561
00:45:02.351 --> 00:45:04.179
I cannot lose you again.

562
00:45:09.706 --> 00:45:10.489
This is the only way.

563
00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:12.535
You need them.

564
00:45:31.859 --> 00:45:32.685
[sighs]

565
00:45:37.429 --> 00:45:38.474
Rest.

566
00:45:38.996 --> 00:45:40.476
Things will be better
in the morning.


567
00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:43.435
You'll see.

568
00:45:46.438 --> 00:45:47.526
I'll make dinner tonight.

569
00:45:50.965 --> 00:45:52.967
I'm thinking risotto.

570
00:45:56.057 --> 00:45:57.275
[door closes]

571
00:45:57.319 --> 00:45:59.495
[squeaking]

572
00:46:32.136 --> 00:46:33.529
[air hissing]

573
00:46:38.012 --> 00:46:38.795
Ah.

574
00:46:41.015 --> 00:46:41.798
See?

575
00:46:44.148 --> 00:46:44.932
Who is that?

576
00:46:46.237 --> 00:46:47.238
That's my sister.

577
00:46:48.196 --> 00:46:49.240
Sophie.

578
00:46:51.373 --> 00:46:52.417
She looks like you.

579
00:46:53.679 --> 00:46:54.942
You must miss your sister a lot.

580
00:46:56.073 --> 00:46:57.074
What happened to Abbey?

581
00:46:59.076 --> 00:47:01.209
I don't remember
Abbey that much.


582
00:47:02.036 --> 00:47:02.732
Is that bad?

583
00:47:03.646 --> 00:47:04.690
[Margot] Of course not.

584
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.563
[Clara] She used to get
in trouble all the time.


585
00:47:10.218 --> 00:47:12.568
Dad would always yell at her and
then everything would be fine.


586
00:47:14.918 --> 00:47:15.701
Not that day.

587
00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:18.966
What happened that day?

588
00:47:21.055 --> 00:47:21.881
That day...

589
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:24.232
Mom found something of Abbey's.

590
00:47:25.102 --> 00:47:25.973
Something really bad.

591
00:47:28.671 --> 00:47:29.715
She ran away.

592
00:47:32.805 --> 00:47:34.329
They found her body
by the shore.


593
00:47:36.287 --> 00:47:37.680
She ate a bunch
of the bad berries.


594
00:47:39.638 --> 00:47:41.466
We've always known
about the bad berries.


595
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:42.990
Dad made sure we knew.

596
00:47:44.556 --> 00:47:45.731
What are the bad berries?

597
00:47:47.255 --> 00:47:48.125
They grow all around.

598
00:47:49.213 --> 00:47:50.910
A single one could kill you.

599
00:47:51.476 --> 00:47:52.477
Dad would always tell us.

600
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:56.090
Dad said it was an accident.

601
00:47:58.135 --> 00:48:00.572
Ray said that
she killed herself.


602
00:48:02.792 --> 00:48:04.446
Ray always told me the truth.

603
00:48:15.413 --> 00:48:16.762
[heavy breathing]

00:48:27.556 --> 00:48:28.731

[laughter continues]

610
00:50:19.494 --> 00:50:20.277
Abbey!

611
00:50:21.278 --> 00:50:23.498
Abbey, you sweet girl!

612
00:50:24.847 --> 00:50:27.023
Oh, I'm so sorry! Mom!

613
00:50:27.066 --> 00:50:29.417
- Mrs. Beaty--
- I'm so sorry-- No!


614
00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:30.287
I'm so sorry. [sobbing]

615
00:50:30.331 --> 00:50:31.375
Fred!

616
00:50:33.508 --> 00:50:34.552
Fred!

617
00:50:37.599 --> 00:50:38.643
It's okay, Mom. It's me.

618
00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:40.167
No!

619
00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:42.560
No! Let go of me!

620
00:50:42.604 --> 00:50:43.822
- Mom!
- Let go!


621
00:50:45.998 --> 00:50:47.348
Mom. It's okay. 
You'll be okay.

622
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:49.567
No, no, no! Let go.

623
00:50:50.568 --> 00:50:51.656
No, please...

624
00:50:52.353 --> 00:50:53.223
Can you sit with her?

625
00:50:55.138 --> 00:50:56.748
Come, it's okay. No! [sobbing]

626

[sobbing continues]

[no audible dialogue]

629
00:51:29.433 --> 00:51:32.219
[sobbing] I'm sorry.

630
00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:36.005
Sorry!

631
00:51:45.667 --> 00:51:46.842

[soft classical music playing]

Don't pretend you
didn't hear that.


635
00:52:35.978 --> 00:52:37.980
You really shouldn't
indulge her that way.


636
00:52:38.023 --> 00:52:39.416
It's the last thing
she needs right now.


637
00:52:56.651 --> 00:52:57.434
What happened to you?

638
00:52:59.349 --> 00:53:03.222
What made you the heartless, horrible
human being you are now, hmm?


639
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:10.012
Whatever happens in the end, wherever
you go, if you go to these caves,


640
00:53:10.491 --> 00:53:13.929
or you go to fucking hell,
I'm not coming with you.

[clicks off]

642
00:53:32.295 --> 00:53:33.078
Dinner's ready!

643
00:53:36.952 --> 00:53:37.953
Is she all right?

644
00:53:38.562 --> 00:53:39.346
Yeah, she's fine.

645
00:53:41.086 --> 00:53:42.131
She understands.

646
00:53:43.437 --> 00:53:45.352
She understands
her mother's gone crazy?


647
00:53:47.354 --> 00:53:48.137
No, don't say that.

648
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:03.108
That day...

649
00:54:06.068 --> 00:54:06.982
That day that you left...

650
00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.074
So proud of you.

651
00:54:15.207 --> 00:54:17.079
Telling your father
what you wanted.


652
00:54:19.516 --> 00:54:20.343
What you needed.

653
00:54:23.128 --> 00:54:24.303
God knows I never...

654
00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.655
I never could.

655
00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:37.926
But you're stronger than him.

656
00:54:41.495 --> 00:54:42.583
Don't let him destroy you.

657
00:54:50.242 --> 00:54:51.287
Come on, Mom.

658
00:54:51.679 --> 00:54:52.462
Ray.

659
00:54:55.639 --> 00:54:56.684
I know.

660
00:55:00.905 --> 00:55:02.472
I know who you are.

661
00:55:10.698 --> 00:55:11.481

662
00:55:13.527 --> 00:55:14.310
So...

663
00:55:15.703 --> 00:55:17.618
So proud of my little boy.
