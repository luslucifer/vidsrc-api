00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.386
希尔大夫
Dr. Hill.


5
00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:57.845
巴西特大夫
Dr. Bassett.


6
00:01:57.845 --> 00:01:59.345
病人在哪里？
Where's the patient?


7
00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:01.678
我真不想在这个时间
把你从床上拽起来
I hated
to drag you out of bed.


8
00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:03.970
趁现在还来得及 放我走行吗？
Will you let me go
while there's still time?


9
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.970
你马上就会知道我为什么这么做了
You'll soon see why I did.


10
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.095
告诉这些白痴我没疯 好吗？
Will you tell
these fools I'm not crazy?


11
00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:13.261
在一切都追悔莫及之前让他们听我说！
Make them listen to me
before it's too late!


12
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:15.261
我来听你说
I'll listen to you.


13
00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:16.678
放开她
Let him go.


14
00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:21.678
你是谁？
Who are you?


15
00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:24.178
我是州立精神病院的希尔大夫
I'm Dr. Hill
from the state mental hospital.


16
00:02:24.178 --> 00:02:25.803
我没疯！
I'm not insane!


17
00:02:25.803 --> 00:02:27.303
放开他！
Let him go!


18
00:02:27.303 --> 00:02:30.428
大夫 现在你必须认真听我说
Doctor,
now you must listen to me.


19
00:02:30.428 --> 00:02:31.803
请你一定要理解我
You must understand me.


20
00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:34.636
我也是名医生
我没疯
I am a doctor, too.
I am not insane.


21
00:02:34.636 --> 00:02:36.095
- 我根本就没疯！
- 好吧 好吧
All right.


22
00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:40.345
让我们坐下谈 医生
然后你告诉我到底发生了什么 好吗？
Suppose we sit down,
and you tell me what happened?


23
00:02:43.303 --> 00:02:45.803
好 那是始于--
Well, it started...


24
00:02:45.803 --> 00:02:48.303
对我来说
始于上个星期四...
for me,
it started last Thursday...


25
00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:51.803
因为我的护士发来紧急通知
in response to an urgent
message from my nurse.


26
00:02:51.803 --> 00:02:55.803
我从一个医学交流研讨大会上急忙赶回家
I'd hurried home
from a medical convention.


27
00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:59.386
乍看之下
一切如常
At first glance,
everything looked the same.


28
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.053
但实际上并不是这样
It wasn't.


29
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.845
某种邪恶的气息已悄悄笼罩了这个小镇
Something evil had taken
possession of the town.


30
00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.345
这两件
These two.


31
00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:09.845
给
Here you are.


32
00:03:09.845 --> 00:03:12.303
谢谢先生
请拿好
Thank you, sir.
There you are.


33
00:03:12.303 --> 00:03:13.803
多谢
Thank you.


34
00:03:16.803 --> 00:03:18.553
费希尔先生，早上好啊
Morning, Mr. Fisher.


35
00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:21.303
大夫！
Doc!


36
00:03:21.303 --> 00:03:22.803
嗨呀 莎莉
Hiya, Sally.


37
00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:25.303
嗨 欢迎回家
真高兴你回来了
Hi. Welcome home.
I'm glad you're back.


38
00:03:25.303 --> 00:03:26.970
米基和宝宝情况如何？
How's Mickey and the baby?


39
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.261
他们挺好的 可是看起来似乎
圣米拉城里的每个人都需要看医生
Fine, but everybody else
in Santa Mira needs a doctor.


40
00:03:30.261 --> 00:03:31.803
你的诊室都被病人塞满了
You've got an office
full of patients.


41
00:03:31.803 --> 00:03:33.595
噢 不要啊
我第一天回来就这样？
Oh, no.
On my first day back?


42
00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:36.011
他们之中有些人已经等了你两星期了
Some of them have
been waiting for two weeks.


43
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.136
为什么不让他们去找珀西
或者卡迈克尔大夫呢？我跟你说过的
Why didn't you send them
to Pursey or Carmichael?


44
00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:41.345
可他们大多都不愿意
他们只想见你
Most of 'em wouldn't go.
They want to see you.


45
00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:42.845
哦？
Oh?


46
00:03:49.636 --> 00:03:50.886
他们有什么症状？
What's the matter with them?


47
00:03:50.886 --> 00:03:52.220
他们就是不说
They wouldn't say.


48
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.553
你知道通常病人们都迫不及待
要描述自己的病症
Usually people can't talk enough
about what's ailing them.


49
00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:58.553
比如说
沃利·埃伯哈德来了两次...
For instance,
Wally Eberhard was in twice...


50
00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:01.178
而且打过三次电话
但他就是不谈自己有什么症状
and called three times,
but he wouldn't say about what.


51
00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:02.386
有点意思
That's funny.


52
00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:04.053
没有一个人愿意说--
从贝基·德里斯科尔...
Nobody would talk...
from Becky Driscoll...


53
00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:06.553
到那个胖交警萨姆·雅纳切克
down to that fat
traffic cop Sam Janzek.


54
00:04:06.553 --> 00:04:10.386
贝基·德里斯科尔？
我以为她在英国呢
Becky Driscoll?
I thought she was in England.


55
00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:14.886
几天前她就回来了
而且她点名要见你
She got back a few days ago,
and she wanted to see you.


56
00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:16.845
还对她有兴趣？
Are you still interested?


57
00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:19.845
我对已婚妇女的兴趣仅限于
严谨的职业范围内...
My interest in married women
is strictly professional...


58
00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:22.886
否则怎能长期抗拒你的诱惑
or yours would have been
a lost cause long ago.


59
00:04:22.886 --> 00:04:25.553
- 研讨会怎么样？
- 棒极了
- How was the convention?
- Wonderful.


60
00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:28.220
我宣读我的论文时
他们简直嫉妒得泪流满面
They wept with envy
when I read my paper.


61
00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:32.136
回来！
MRS. GRIMALDl: Come back here!


62
00:04:32.136 --> 00:04:33.303
吉米！
Jimmy!


63
00:04:34.303 --> 00:04:37.761
怎么了
格里马尔迪太太？
What's the matter,
Mrs. Grimaldi?


64
00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:39.803
没什么 他就是不愿意上学！
It's nothing. He just don't
want to go to school.


65
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.303
我要是你的话
就会去找她的老师谈谈
If I were you, I'd have
a talk with his teacher.


66
00:04:45.303 --> 00:04:47.303
等有时间了我就去
MRS. GRIMALDl:
I will when I get time.


67
00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:49.428
发生什么了
乔生病了吗？
What's the matter?
Has Joe been sick?


68
00:04:49.428 --> 00:04:51.511
不 我们只是不再经营这个市场了
MRS. GRIMALDl: No.
We gave the stand up.


69
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:53.845
- 需要太多劳动力
- 哦
- Too much work.
- Oh.


70
00:04:53.845 --> 00:04:55.720
那孩子的惊慌失措当时就应该让我明白...
The boy's
panic should have told me...


71
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.928
他所恐惧的绝不仅仅是上学...
it was more than school
he was afraid of...


72
00:04:57.928 --> 00:04:59.553
还有那堆满垃圾的 倒闭了的菜市场...
and that littered,
closed-up vegetable stand...


73
00:04:59.553 --> 00:05:01.845
也许也在暗示着些什么
should have
told me something, too.


74
00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:03.345
我最后一次看见它的时候
还是在不到一个月之前...
When I last saw it,
less than a month ago...


75
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:05.970
那时它还是这条大路上
最整洁最繁忙的一个市场
it was the cleanest
and busiest stand on the road.


76
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.720
真是奇怪
That's strange.


77
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.261
她也来找过你--
就在上周五
She was in to see you, too...
last Friday.


78
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:13.011
我曾尝试说服她去找珀西大夫
但她不愿意
I tried to get her to see
Doc Pursey, but she wouldn't.


79
00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.178
她说只有你才能帮助她
She said only you
could help her.


80
00:05:15.178 --> 00:05:16.428
好吧 不管她有什么毛病...
Whatever it was...


81
00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:19.720
我想应该都不会很严重
it couldn't have been
too serious, I guess.


82
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.220
一例轻微脑震荡 两例普通感冒...
One minor concussion,
two cases of the common cold...


83
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.220
还有六个已取消的预约
and six canceled appointments.


84
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.720
看来你急急忙忙把我拽回来
也并没有什么事嘛
Looks like you rushed me here
for nothing.


85
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.220
我不明白...
他们都迫不及待要见你啊
I don't understand it.
They couldn't wait to see you.


86
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.720
不过今天下午你的日程也会排得满满的
But you're still booked up solid
for the afternoon.


87
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.470
我打赌他们不会来
看那里 是沃利·埃伯哈德...
I bet they don't show.
Look, there's Wally Eberhard...


88
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.678
正在跟路人推销保险呢
talking somebody
into buying some insurance.


89
00:05:40.678 --> 00:05:41.928
他一点问题也没有嘛
There's nothing wrong with him.


90
00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:43.303
比尔·比特纳正要带他的小秘去吃午饭
Bill Bitner's taking
his secretary to lunch.


91
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.011
啊 说到午饭...
And speaking of lunch...


92
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:48.595
能否跟来找我的任何人说 我去用餐了？
will you tell whoever that is
that I'm out having mine?


93
00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:49.761
本耐尔大夫在吗？
Is Dr. Bennell in?


94
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:51.678
是的 他在
Yes, he's here.


95
00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:53.470
你认为他有空接待我吗？
Do you suppose
he has time to see me?


96
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.345
如果他没出什么毛病的话
If he hasn't,
something's wrong with him.


97
00:05:55.345 --> 00:05:56.511
进去吧
Go right in.


98
00:05:58.345 --> 00:05:59.970
贝基
Becky.


99
00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:03.595
快五年了
Almost five years.


100
00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:04.845
回家的感觉真好
It's wonderful to be home again.


101
00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:06.095
我离开得太久了...
I've been away so long...


102
00:06:06.095 --> 00:06:08.678
回到老家却觉得自己像个外乡人
I feel almost like a stranger
in my own country.


103
00:06:09.678 --> 00:06:11.845
我没有预约就来了 但愿你别介意
Hope you don't mind my coming
without an appointment.


104
00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:14.053
才不会
想做点什么？
Not at all.
What'll you have?


105
00:06:14.053 --> 00:06:15.803
这周我们做推广促销的是阑尾切除术
We're pushing appendectomies
this week.


106
00:06:15.803 --> 00:06:16.970
噢 米尔斯
Oh, Miles.


107
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.261
我不知道 或许我老是胡闹乱开玩笑
I don't know,
maybe I clown around too much.


108
00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:21.261
用不了多久 我的病人们...
Pretty soon, my patients...


109
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:23.761
就会连我给他们开的阿司匹林都不敢信任了
won't trust me
to prescribe aspirin for them.


110
00:06:23.761 --> 00:06:25.261
说真的 是有什么问题？
Seriously, what's the trouble?


111
00:06:25.261 --> 00:06:27.470
是我表妹
It's my cousin.


112
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.428
威尔玛？
她怎么了？
Wilma?
What's the matter with her?


113
00:06:30.803 --> 00:06:32.511
她出现了些 呃...
She has a...


114
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.136
我猜你们称之为“幻觉”
I guess you'd call it
a delusion.


115
00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:37.511
你认识他叔叔吧？
艾拉叔叔？
You know her uncle?
Uncle Ira?


116
00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:39.095
当然 我是他的大夫
Sure. I'm his doctor.


117
00:06:39.095 --> 00:06:42.136
现在她自己认为他不是她的叔叔
She's got herself
thinking he isn't her uncle.


118
00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:43.970
你指的是什么？
他们实际上没有血缘关系？
How do you mean?
That they're not really related?


119
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.678
她觉得他是个冒充的傀儡一类的...
She thinks
he's an impostor or something...


120
00:06:46.678 --> 00:06:48.553
...某种只是外表看起来是艾拉叔叔的东西
someone who only looks like Ira.


121
00:06:48.553 --> 00:06:49.970
你见过他了吧？
Have you seen him?


122
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.220
我就是刚从他那过来的
I just came from there.


123
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.720
他到底是不是艾拉叔叔呢？
Is he Uncle Ira,
or isn't he Uncle Ira?


124
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.886
当然是啦
Of course he is.


125
00:06:55.886 --> 00:06:57.970
我跟威尔玛强调过了 可是没有用
I told Wilma that,
but it was no use.


126
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.720
拜托 你有空的话能否顺便过去和她聊聊？
Please, would you stop by
and have a talk with her?


127
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.303
莎莉说我整个下午的日程都排满了...
Sally says I'm booked up
for the afternoon...


128
00:07:02.303 --> 00:07:04.970
不过你为什么不让她过来找我呢
but why don't you ask her
to come in and see me?


129
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.470
我试试吧
I'll try.


130
00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.886
呃 共进午餐如何？
How about some lunch?


131
00:07:09.886 --> 00:07:12.220
不行 我一会要去店里见爸爸
I can't.
I'm meeting Dad at the store.


132
00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:18.136
你是什么时候回来的
When did you get back?


133
00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:20.803
两个月前从伦敦回来的
I came back from London
two months ago.


134
00:07:20.803 --> 00:07:22.261
之前我一直是在里诺
【里诺：美国有名的“离婚城市”
位于内华达州西部】
I've been in Reno.


135
00:07:22.261 --> 00:07:23.428
里诺？
Reno?


136
00:07:23.428 --> 00:07:25.261
里诺
Reno.


137
00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:26.761
爸爸告诉过我你也曾待在那里
Dad tells me
you were there, too.


138
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:28.261
五个月前吧
Five months ago.


139
00:07:28.261 --> 00:07:30.261
哦 真遗憾
Oh, I'm sorry.


140
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:31.761
我有同感
So was I.


141
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:34.261
我曾希望我们能在那相遇
I wanted it to work.


142
00:07:34.261 --> 00:07:37.720
好吧 我想现在我们终于上了同一条船
I guess that makes us
lodge brothers now.


143
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.928
是的
Yes.


144
00:07:38.928 --> 00:07:41.970
除了我付租你收租的区别以外
Except I'm paying dues
while you collect them.


145
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.136
哈哈哈 米尔斯
Ha ha ha! Miles.


146
00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:53.636
- 哈喽 大夫
- 你好吗？
- Hello, doc.
- How are you?


147
00:07:53.636 --> 00:07:54.803
萨姆！
Sam!


148
00:07:54.803 --> 00:07:56.803
又在贴条了哈？
At it again, eh?


149
00:07:56.803 --> 00:07:58.136
我的护士告诉我你上周来过诊室...
My nurse tells me
you were in last week...


150
00:07:58.136 --> 00:08:00.303
而且迫切要与我会面
and wanted very much
to see me.


151
00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:02.303
没那么严重的啦
It wasn't anything important.


152
00:08:03.303 --> 00:08:05.303
他跟我们一起上过学吗？
Didn't he go to college with us?


153
00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:07.303
大二的时候为了结婚退学了...
Quit his second year
to get married...


154
00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:09.803
就像我曾希望咱俩去做的那样
like I wanted us to do.


155
00:08:09.803 --> 00:08:12.428
应该感到庆幸的是我没当真
Just be thankful
I didn't take you seriously.


156
00:08:12.428 --> 00:08:13.970
不感到庆幸？
You be thankful.


157
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.428
我发现要成为一名医生的妻子...
I found out
that a doctor's wife...


158
00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:17.136
需要有对爱因斯坦的理解和包容...
needs the understanding
of an Einstein...


159
00:08:17.136 --> 00:08:18.761
还要有圣人的耐心
and patience of a saint.


160
00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:20.261
那爱情呢？
And love?


161
00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:22.261
我怎么知道
I wouldn't know about that.


162
00:08:22.261 --> 00:08:24.261
我不过是个普通医师而已
I'm just a general practitioner.


163
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:26.761
爱情这玩意还是留给啥专家们去搞定吧
Love is handled
by the specialists.


164
00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:29.761
好吧 我该走了
Here's where I leave you.


165
00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:31.303
你知道吗？
You know something?


166
00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:34.803
这该是你最后一次离开我身边
This is where you left me
the last time.


167
00:08:34.803 --> 00:08:36.303
嗨 约翰尼
Hiya, Johnny.


168
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.178
莎莉 我该走了
Sally, I'm off.


169
00:08:45.178 --> 00:08:47.303
告诉接线生我会在自己家里
Tell the answering service
I'll be at home.


170
00:08:47.303 --> 00:08:48.803
晚安 大夫
Good night, doc.


171
00:08:48.803 --> 00:08:50.886
我不要进去...
I'm not going in there!


172
00:08:50.886 --> 00:08:53.553
别胡闹了！
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Stop all this nonsense.


173
00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:56.803
嘿 嘿 放松点
Hey! Take it easy!


174
00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:58.803
这不是小吉米 格里马尔迪吗？
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?


175
00:08:58.803 --> 00:09:00.803
是的 大夫
我能跟你谈谈吗？
MRS. GRIMALDl: Yes, Doctor.
Can I talk to you a moment?


176
00:09:00.803 --> 00:09:02.720
当然 知道吗
今早我差点开车撞到你
Sure. I almost
ran you down this morning.


177
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.803
过马路的时候可要加倍小心哦
You got to be careful
when you run out in the road.


178
00:09:04.803 --> 00:09:06.303
来
Come on.


179
00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:07.803
过来
MRS. GRIMALDl: Come on.


180
00:09:11.303 --> 00:09:13.261
嘿！嘿！嘿！
Hey! Hey! Hey!


181
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.761
嘿！别着急
Hey! Slow down now.


182
00:09:15.761 --> 00:09:17.511
去上学也不是那么糟糕的呀
School isn't as bad as all that.


183
00:09:17.511 --> 00:09:19.053
上学不是让他变成这样的原因
MRS. GRIMALDl:
School isn't what upsets him.


184
00:09:19.053 --> 00:09:20.428
是我儿媳
It's my daughter-in-law.


185
00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:22.928
他不知怎么产生的这个疯念头
觉得她不是他妈妈
He's got the crazy idea
she isn't his mother.


186
00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:24.428
她不是！她就不是！
She isn't! She isn't!


187
00:09:24.428 --> 00:09:26.053
别让她抓住我！
Don't let her get me!


188
00:09:26.053 --> 00:09:29.178
没人会来抓你的 吉米
Nobody's going
to get you, Jimmy.


189
00:09:35.678 --> 00:09:37.345
这个症状持续多久了？
How long has this been going on?


190
00:09:37.345 --> 00:09:40.095
一个小时前 我在地窖发现他在那里藏着
MRS. GRIMALDl: An hour ago,
I found him in the cellar.


191
00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:43.428
他一言不发 直到我开始给他妈妈打电话
He wouldn't say anything until
I started to phone his mother.


192
00:09:43.428 --> 00:09:45.261
这时他告诉我安娜不是他妈妈
That's when he said Anna
wasn't his mother.


193
00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:47.761
你能暂时让他在你那里呆一两天吗？
Could you keep him
with you for a day or so?


194
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:50.386
这个药给他每四小时吃一次
Give him one of these every
four hours during the day.


195
00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:52.261
明天给我打个电话 告诉我他情况如何
Call me tomorrow and let me know
how he's feeling.


196
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:53.761
好的 大夫 谢谢你
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Yes, Doctor, thank you.


197
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:55.970
别让她抓住我！
Don't let her get me!


198
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.011
没人会来抓你的
Nobody's going to get you.


199
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:06.303
好吧 吉米
All right, Jimmy.


200
00:10:06.303 --> 00:10:07.803
张开嘴
Open your mouth.


201
00:10:07.803 --> 00:10:09.303
闭上眼睛
Shut your eyes.


202
00:10:09.303 --> 00:10:11.428
以诗人之名...
In the words of the poet...


203
00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:13.345
我给你吃令人充满智慧的神奇药丸
I'll give you something
to make you wise.


204
00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:16.803
真是个好孩子 吉米
That's a good boy, Jimmy.


205
00:10:16.803 --> 00:10:18.845
我绝不要回家
I'm not going home ever.


206
00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:21.178
你会暂时留在奶奶家的
给他妈妈打个电话...
You're staying at your
grandmother's. Call his mother.


207
00:10:21.178 --> 00:10:22.511
她不是我妈妈！
She's not my mother!


208
00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:24.845
好吧好吧 你们先回去
一切都会没事的
All right. Run along.
Everything's going to be OK.


209
00:10:24.845 --> 00:10:26.386
做个乖孩子哦
You be a good boy now.


210
00:10:26.386 --> 00:10:27.803
晚安 大夫
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Good night, Doctor.


211
00:10:27.803 --> 00:10:29.011
晚安
Good night.


212
00:10:30.678 --> 00:10:33.345
我改变主意了
我先不直接回家去
I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.


213
00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:34.803
顺路去看看威尔玛·伦茨的情况
I'm going to stop off
and see Wilma Lentz.


214
00:10:34.803 --> 00:10:36.553
我需要给这孩子的母亲打个电话？
Should I call the boy's mother?


215
00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.553
是的 告诉她发生了什么...
Yes.
Tell her what happened...


216
00:10:38.553 --> 00:10:40.720
并且告诉她我建议最好先让孩子...
and that I suggested
the boy spend the night...


217
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.386
住在他奶奶家
at his grandmother's house.


218
00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:51.845
你好 米尔斯
Hello, Miles.


219
00:10:51.845 --> 00:10:54.303
见到你真好 威尔玛 贝基
Nice to see you, Wilma.
Becky.


220
00:10:54.303 --> 00:10:55.761
直奔主题吧
Let's have it.


221
00:10:55.761 --> 00:10:57.428
你刚才跟他聊过了 有什么感想？
You talked to him.
What do you think?


222
00:10:57.428 --> 00:10:58.636
就是他 没错啊
It's him.


223
00:10:58.636 --> 00:11:00.720
他就是你的艾拉叔叔，一切正常
He's your Uncle Ira, all right.


224
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.261
他才不是
He is not.


225
00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:11.845
他有什么变化吗？
How is he different?


226
00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:12.970
就是这样子
That's just it.


227
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.970
根本就没有肉眼能发现的区别
There is no difference
you can actually see.


228
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.345
他的外表 说话和行事风格 以及记忆...
He looks, sounds, acts,
and remembers...


229
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:19.553
都跟艾拉叔叔一样
like Uncle Ira.


230
00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:21.136
那他就是你的艾拉叔叔啊
Then he is your Uncle Ira.


231
00:11:21.136 --> 00:11:24.511
你不明白吗？
不管你有什么样的感觉 他就是
You see that?
No matter how you feel, he is.


232
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:27.011
但他不是
有哪里不对劲 好像缺失了什么
But he isn't.
There's something missing.


233
00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:30.386
当我还小的时候 他对我视如己出
He's been a father to me
since I was a baby.


234
00:11:30.386 --> 00:11:31.970
每当他跟我说话的时候...
Always when he talked to me...


235
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.595
他的眼神里有些很特别的东西
there was a special look
in his eye.


236
00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:36.886
现在这样的眼神不见了
That look's gone.


237
00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:39.678
那记忆方面如何？
肯定有某些特别的东西...
What about memories?
There must be certain things...


238
00:11:39.678 --> 00:11:42.178
是只有你们两个人知道的
that only you and he
would know about.


239
00:11:42.178 --> 00:11:43.303
有的
There are.


240
00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:45.761
我跟他聊过这些
他全部都记得...
I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all...


241
00:11:45.761 --> 00:11:49.011
哪怕是最微小的细节
就像艾拉叔叔会记得的一样
down to the last small detail,
just like Uncle Ira would.


242
00:11:50.845 --> 00:11:52.345
但是 米尔斯...
But, Miles...


243
00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:53.803
他没有情感
there's no emotion.


244
00:11:53.803 --> 00:11:55.011
毫无！
None!


245
00:11:55.011 --> 00:11:57.845
只有假装出来的情感
Just the pretense of it.


246
00:11:57.845 --> 00:11:59.886
语言 姿势 声调...
The words, gesture,
the tone of voice...


247
00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:02.845
任何的一切都跟原来没有区别
除了感情
everything else is the same,
but not the feeling.


248
00:12:04.678 --> 00:12:07.136
不管他有没有记忆
他都不是我的艾拉叔叔
Memories or not,
he isn't my Uncle Ira.


249
00:12:07.136 --> 00:12:09.220
威尔玛 我是站在你这边的
Wilma, I'm on your side.


250
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.970
我的事业是帮助需要帮助的人...
My business
is people in trouble...


251
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.386
我会找到可以帮你的方法
and I'm going to find
a way to help you.


252
00:12:12.386 --> 00:12:15.178
没有人可能扮成你的艾拉叔叔...
No one could possibly
impersonate your Uncle Ira...


253
00:12:15.178 --> 00:12:17.761
并还能让你和艾莱达伯母 甚至我...
without you
or your Aunt Eleda or even me...


254
00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:19.761
都找不出千万个破绽的
seeing a million
little differences.


255
00:12:19.761 --> 00:12:21.845
我希望你能认识到这一点
I want you to realize that.


256
00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:23.970
好好想想
然后你就会明白...
Think about it,
and then you'll know...


257
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.261
是你自己的问题
that the trouble is inside you.


258
00:12:27.261 --> 00:12:29.720
威尔玛 你在哪？
Wilma, where are you?


259
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.636
在草坪上
Out on the lawn.


260
00:12:31.636 --> 00:12:33.553
什么也别跟她说
Say nothing to her.


261
00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:36.470
哎呀 米尔斯
我都不知道你来了
Why, Miles,
I didn't know you were here.


262
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.678
欢迎回来
Welcome home.


263
00:12:37.678 --> 00:12:38.886
你好 伦茨太太
Hello, Mrs. Lentz.


264
00:12:38.886 --> 00:12:41.053
你们邀请米尔斯留下共进晚餐了吗？
Did you ask Miles
to stay for dinner?


265
00:12:41.053 --> 00:12:42.261
今晚不行
Can't tonight.


266
00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:43.553
我今天做了蛋奶糕
I'm making spoon bread.


267
00:12:43.553 --> 00:12:45.053
拜托 可别诱惑我
Please, don't tempt me.


268
00:12:45.053 --> 00:12:46.261
下次有机会吧
Maybe next time.


269
00:12:46.261 --> 00:12:48.261
威尔玛 我的眼镜在哪儿？
Wilma, where are my glasses?


270
00:12:48.261 --> 00:12:50.220
我想大概在壁炉台上
I think
they're on the mantelpiece.


271
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.553
我跟你一起去拿
I'll go with you.


272
00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:04.761
我是发疯了吗？
Am I going crazy?


273
00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:06.761
别可怜我 我必须知道
Don't spare me.
I've got to know.


274
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:08.761
不 你没有疯
即使是当今...
No, you're not.
Even these days...


275
00:13:08.761 --> 00:13:11.428
发疯也不是一件如你想象中
那般容易的事情啊
it isn't as easy to go crazy
as you might think.


276
00:13:11.428 --> 00:13:13.220
不过你不用过于迫切...
But you don't have to be
losing your mind...


277
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.636
去寻求精神科的治疗
to need psychiatric help.


278
00:13:15.636 --> 00:13:18.178
我希望你能见见我的一个医生朋友
I'd like you to see
a doctor friend of mine.


279
00:13:18.178 --> 00:13:21.011
- 心理医生吗？
- 丹·考夫曼
- A psychiatrist?
- Dan Kauffman.


280
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:24.928
明天我会帮你预约
I'll make an appointment
for you tomorrow.


281
00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:28.470
好吧
All right.


282
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.970
可那纯属浪费时间
我什么毛病也没有
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.


283
00:13:35.345 --> 00:13:38.345
先到此为止吧 不然他会起疑的
Better break this up,
or he'll start wondering.


284
00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:41.470
起疑什么？
Wondering what?


285
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.011
不乱想的话 你的来访对我帮助很大...
If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help...


286
00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:46.845
我不想你们任何人为我担心
and I don't want either of you
to worry about me.


287
00:13:46.845 --> 00:13:48.095
我会好好的
I'll be all right.


288
00:13:48.095 --> 00:13:49.636
你当然会啦
Sure you will.


289
00:13:49.636 --> 00:13:51.761
你要留在这吗 贝基？
还是我送你回家？
Staying here, Becky?
Or may I drive you home?


290
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:53.303
想让我留下吗？
Would you like me to stay?


291
00:13:53.303 --> 00:13:55.595
当然不了
晚安
Of course not.
Good night.


292
00:13:55.595 --> 00:13:57.595
晚安
Good night.


293
00:14:07.886 --> 00:14:10.303
贝基回来了真好啊？孩子
Nice having Becky
back again, eh, boy?


294
00:14:10.303 --> 00:14:11.803
可说呢
Sure is.


295
00:14:16.636 --> 00:14:18.011
我的脑海深处...
In the back of my mind...


296
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:19.761
响起了警钟
a warning bell was ringing.


297
00:14:19.761 --> 00:14:21.511
那些迫不及待需要见我的病人们...
Sick people
who couldn't wait to see me...


298
00:14:21.511 --> 00:14:23.470
一夜之间全部恢复正常：
then suddenly
were perfectly all right.


299
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.803
一个哭喊着他妈妈不再是他的妈妈的孩子
A boy claiming
his mother wasn't his mother.


300
00:14:25.803 --> 00:14:27.845
一个宣称她的叔叔不再是她的叔叔的女人
A woman claiming her uncle
wasn't her uncle.


301
00:14:27.845 --> 00:14:29.220
但当时我并没有听警钟的召唤
But I didn't listen.


302
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.178
很明显 孩子的妈妈还是他妈妈
Obviously, the boy's mother
was his mother.


303
00:14:31.178 --> 00:14:34.303
我见过她了
而艾拉叔叔还是艾拉叔叔
I had seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.


304
00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:36.428
当我与他交谈过以后 这简直毫无疑问
There was no doubt of that
after I talked to him.


305
00:14:36.428 --> 00:14:38.720
米尔斯 他确实是艾拉叔叔？
Miles, he is Ira?


306
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.511
当然 你的意思是？
Of course he is.
What do you mean?


307
00:14:41.511 --> 00:14:43.678
只是威尔玛实在是太坚定了
It's just Wilma's so positive.


308
00:14:43.678 --> 00:14:45.220
她会好起来吗？
Will she be all right?


309
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.761
我想会的
I think so.


310
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.678
从学历上来看 我是一个医生...
I'm a doctor,
according to my diploma...


311
00:14:48.678 --> 00:14:51.136
但我真的看不出威尔玛有什么毛病
but I don't really know
what Wilma's trouble is.


312
00:14:51.136 --> 00:14:53.428
我可以讲一些精神科的术语来糊弄人...
I could start talking
psychiatrical jargon...


313
00:14:53.428 --> 00:14:56.428
不过那就越界了
这是丹·考夫曼的领域
but it's out of my line
and in Dan Kauffman's.


314
00:14:58.178 --> 00:15:00.720
真希望你不用回家吃晚饭
I wish you didn't have
to go home for dinner.


315
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.720
不用的 爸爸跟朋友出去吃饭了
I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.


316
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.261
7点我来接你
I could pick you up
at 7:00.


317
00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:08.761
嗯...
Well...


318
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:11.345
现在是夏天 而且会是满月哦
It's summer,
and the moon is full.


319
00:15:11.345 --> 00:15:12.553
“我知道一处浅滩...”
"I know a bank...


320
00:15:12.553 --> 00:15:15.386
“铺满了狂野的百里香”
"where the wild thyme grows. "


321
00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:17.095
你真是一点都没变
You haven't changed a bit.


322
00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:33.011
哇！哇！注意点！
Whup! Whoa! Watch out!


323
00:15:33.011 --> 00:15:34.261
抱歉
Sorry.


324
00:15:34.261 --> 00:15:36.595
嘿 米尔斯
你什么时候回来的？
Hey, Miles,
when did you get back?


325
00:15:36.595 --> 00:15:37.845
今早
丹尼 你好吗？
This morning.
How are you, Danny?


326
00:15:37.845 --> 00:15:39.011
这位是德里斯科尔小姐
This is Miss Driscoll.


327
00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:40.928
这是考夫曼先生--
我们的一位 也是唯一的一位精神科专家
Dr. Kauffman...
our one and only psychiatrist.


328
00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:43.136
注意自己的言行
埃德，还记得贝基吗？
Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.


329
00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:44.678
必须的
她出生时是我接生的
I should.
I brought her into the world.


330
00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:46.178
你可给大家做了一件大好事
You did us all a favor.


331
00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:47.928
这下我就不用专门给你打电话了
This saves me a phone call.


332
00:15:47.928 --> 00:15:50.720
我这有一个小孩和一位女性 需要一名巫医
I've got a kid and a woman
who need a witch doctor.


333
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.428
孩子说爸爸不是爸爸了...
Boy says his father
isn't his father...


334
00:15:52.428 --> 00:15:54.553
然后女人说姐妹不是姐妹了？
and the woman says her sister
isn't her sister?


335
00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:56.178
还真差不多
That's pretty close.


336
00:15:56.178 --> 00:15:58.178
我知道你一直在研究催眠术...
I knew you'd been
studying hypnosis...


337
00:15:58.178 --> 00:15:59.970
不过你什么时候学会读心术啦？
but when did you start
reading minds?


338
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.470
他不需要使用读心术
He doesn't have to read them.


339
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.428
自从这种情况开始以来
我已经给他那里送去了一打多的病人了
I've sent him a dozen patients
since it started.


340
00:16:03.428 --> 00:16:05.470
是什么？
怎么回事？
What is it?
What's going on?


341
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.970
我不知道
一种奇怪的神经性现象...
I don't know.
A strange neurosis...


342
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.803
显然极具蔓延性--
像是一场可传染的集体性癔病
evidently contagious...
an epidemic of mass hysteria.


343
00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.636
两周之后
席卷了整个小镇
In two weeks,
it's spread all over town.


344
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.011
是什么引起的？
What causes it?


345
00:16:15.011 --> 00:16:17.636
过于操心世界局势所导致的吧 或许
Worry about
what's going on in the world.


346
00:16:19.303 --> 00:16:21.303
明天给威尔玛·伦茨安排一下吧好吗？
Make room
for Wilma Lentz tomorrow.


347
00:16:21.303 --> 00:16:23.928
让她2点左右过来
晚安
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.


348
00:16:23.928 --> 00:16:25.095
再会 丹尼
So long, Danny.


349
00:16:30.136 --> 00:16:33.720
这真是我听到过最诡异的事
This is the oddest thing
I ever heard of.


350
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.636
但愿我们别染上这毛病
Let's hope we don't catch it.


351
00:16:35.636 --> 00:16:37.636
我绝不愿某天早上醒来...
I'd hate to wake up
some morning...


352
00:16:37.636 --> 00:16:39.303
发现身边的你不再是你
and find out you weren't you.


353
00:16:39.303 --> 00:16:41.636
我可不再是那时候被你的浪漫
哄得晕头转向的高中女生了
I'm not the high-school
kid you used to romance.


354
00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:42.886
你怎么分辨呢？
How could you tell?


355
00:16:42.886 --> 00:16:44.053
真的想知道？
You really want to know?


356
00:16:44.053 --> 00:16:45.220
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.


357
00:16:52.178 --> 00:16:54.845
唔~~~
你是贝基·德里斯科尔没错
Mmm.
You're Becky Driscoll.


358
00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:59.261
嘿 圣米拉真是越来越蒸蒸日上了
Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.


359
00:16:59.261 --> 00:17:01.761
从你回来后才开始的
Has ever since you got back.


360
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:04.761
你平时对病人也是这种态度吗 大夫？
（bedside manner 双关语）
Is this an example
of your bedside manner, Doctor?


361
00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:07.261
不 女士 那件事可要等一会儿
（贝基意指病床边 米尔斯指床上）
No, ma'am.
That comes later.


362
00:17:18.136 --> 00:17:19.636
晚上好 大夫
Good evening, Doctor.


363
00:17:19.636 --> 00:17:21.595
人都到哪儿去了？
What happened
to the crowd tonight?


364
00:17:21.595 --> 00:17:24.220
我不知道
这种情况已经持续好几周了
I don't know.
It's been this way for weeks.


365
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.470
好吧 至少我们不用等桌位了
At least we don't
have to wait for a table.


366
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.720
你挑吧 坐这里 还是那边
Take your pick.
Here or here.


367
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.553
这边吧 我想
怎么样？
Here, I think.
Shall we?


368
00:17:32.845 --> 00:17:33.761
嗯
Mm-hmm.


369
00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:35.178
乐队到哪里去了？
Where's the band?


370
00:17:35.178 --> 00:17:38.178
生意不景气
所以我只好把他们打发走了
Business slumped,
so I had to let them go.


371
00:17:38.178 --> 00:17:39.428
不过那边还有自动唱机
There's the jukebox, though.


372
00:17:39.428 --> 00:17:41.220
跳支舞吧？
Shall we dance?


373
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.178
希望你还没有把酒保打发走
I hope you didn't
let the bartender go.


374
00:17:43.178 --> 00:17:45.178
我就是酒保
喝马提尼？
I'm the bartender.
Martinis?


375
00:17:45.178 --> 00:17:47.011
两杯 烈的
Two. Dry.


376
00:17:48.178 --> 00:17:50.345
要很烈
Very dry.


377
00:17:51.678 --> 00:17:54.386
米尔斯 我不在意考夫曼医生说了些什么
Miles, I don't care
what Dr. Kauffman says.


378
00:17:54.386 --> 00:17:55.678
我只是很担心
I'm worried.


379
00:17:55.678 --> 00:17:57.428
你现在可是在...
You are in the capable hands...


380
00:17:57.428 --> 00:17:59.678
你最得力的私人医师手里
of your personal physician.


381
00:17:59.678 --> 00:18:01.178
噢 大夫
Oh, Doctor.


382
00:18:01.178 --> 00:18:03.678
啊 我们的夜生活...
Ah, there's our evening.


383
00:18:03.678 --> 00:18:05.178
抱歉
Sorry.


384
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.678
谢谢
Thanks.


385
00:18:09.678 --> 00:18:11.178
本耐尔大夫
Dr. Bennell.


386
00:18:11.178 --> 00:18:14.803
杰克·拜里塞克想要你现在立刻赶到他家去
Jack Belicec wants you
to come to his house right away.


387
00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.636
他说是紧急情况
He says it's urgent.


388
00:18:16.636 --> 00:18:18.636
谢谢
Thank you.


389
00:18:20.136 --> 00:18:22.136
还是把酒收起来吧
Better hold those drinks.


390
00:18:22.136 --> 00:18:23.303
急诊
Emergency.


391
00:18:23.303 --> 00:18:25.803
还好至少他们在我们开始
共进晚餐前打来了电话
At least they called
before we ordered dinner.


392
00:18:25.803 --> 00:18:26.970
你饿不饿？
How hungry are you?


393
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.261
我可以等
I can wait.


394
00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:29.636
可能会久一些
It may be a while.


395
00:18:29.636 --> 00:18:31.136
我和你一起去
I'll go with you.


396
00:18:31.136 --> 00:18:33.136
对不起 我们一会再回来
Sorry.
We'll be back later.


397
00:18:48.136 --> 00:18:50.136
杰克在那里
There's Jack.


398
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.553
你好 杰克 怎么了？
泰迪生病了？
What's the matter?
Teddy sick?


399
00:19:04.553 --> 00:19:06.303
没有
No.


400
00:19:06.303 --> 00:19:08.553
谢天谢地 我以为你来不了了
Thank heaven.
I thought you'd never arrive.


401
00:19:08.553 --> 00:19:09.970
那是谁病了？
Then who is sick?


402
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.178
没人生病
Nobody.


403
00:19:11.178 --> 00:19:13.970
那你为什么要把我从餐桌前揪过来？
Then why'd you
drag me away from my dinner?


404
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.136
你不会相信的 米尔斯
直到你自己亲眼目睹
You won't believe it
until you see it.


405
00:19:16.136 --> 00:19:17.428
你好 贝基
Hello, Becky.


406
00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:19.053
- 你好 贝基
- 嗨 泰迪
- Hello, Becky.
- Hi, Teddy.


407
00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:26.095
能否暂时先把你的医生身份抛在脑后？
Could you forget
you're a doctor a while?


408
00:19:26.095 --> 00:19:27.345
为何？
Why?


409
00:19:27.345 --> 00:19:29.470
我不想你马上去叫警察
I don't want you
calling the police.


410
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.928
别整得像个文艺青年
到底怎么了？
Quit acting like a writer.


411
00:19:31.928 --> 00:19:34.470
没准你能告诉我发生了什么
你可是医生
Maybe you can tell me.
You're the doctor.


412
00:19:44.803 --> 00:19:47.803
米尔斯 把台球桌上面的灯打开
Miles, put the light on
over the pool table.


413
00:20:00.386 --> 00:20:02.053
继续 拉开它
Go on. Pull it down.


414
00:20:45.553 --> 00:20:47.220
你有什么结论？
What do you make of it?


415
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.386
这是谁？
Who is he?


416
00:20:50.386 --> 00:20:52.761
我毫无头绪
I have no idea.


417
00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:01.261
它的脸 米尔斯
模糊不清
Its face, Miles.
It's vague.


418
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.886
第一印象
就好像硬币上印着的头像一样
Like the first impression
that's stamped on a coin.


419
00:21:04.886 --> 00:21:06.095
它还未完成
It isn't finished.


420
00:21:06.095 --> 00:21:07.261
没错
You're right.


421
00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:09.261
只有大概的容貌
但是没有细节...
All the features
but no details...


422
00:21:09.261 --> 00:21:11.011
没有特征 没有线条
no character, no lines.


423
00:21:11.011 --> 00:21:12.928
它不是具人类尸体
It's no dead man.


424
00:21:12.928 --> 00:21:14.928
你家有拓印台吗？
Have you got
an ink pad around the house?


425
00:21:14.928 --> 00:21:17.011
桌子上有一个
干嘛用？
There's one in the desk.
Why?


426
00:21:17.011 --> 00:21:19.178
我想提取一下这具躯体的指纹
I want to take
the corpse's fingerprints.


427
00:21:19.178 --> 00:21:21.470
这肯定是具死尸 不然还能是什么？
Of course
it's a dead man.


428
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.220
我不知道 但是我有一种感觉...
I don't know,
but I've got a feeling that...


429
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.053
我知道这听起来很疯狂
但是如果我做一下尸体解剖的话...
I know this sounds crazy,
but if I should do an autopsy...


430
00:21:27.053 --> 00:21:30.178
我想每个器官大概都是完美无损的...
I think I'd find every organ
in perfect condition...


431
00:21:32.178 --> 00:21:35.428
完美无缺
就像这具躯体外表看起来那样...
as perfect
as the body is externally...


432
00:21:37.428 --> 00:21:39.428
躯体状况良好
everything in working order.


433
00:21:39.428 --> 00:21:42.511
准备就绪 把那个拿过来
All set to go. Hold that down.


434
00:21:48.136 --> 00:21:49.928
没有指纹...
These are blank.


435
00:21:49.928 --> 00:21:52.220
像是在等待脸部完成...
Waiting for the final
finished face...


436
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.845
...以后才会变出来
to be stamped onto it.


437
00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:56.470
但 是谁的脸？
But whose face?


438
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.345
告诉我
Tell me that.


439
00:21:59.553 --> 00:22:01.720
我想我们可以先喝一杯
We could all use a drink.


440
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.303
喝波本可以吗？
Bourbon all right?


441
00:22:05.303 --> 00:22:06.470
好的
Fine.


442
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.053
我不喝 谢谢
Not for me, thanks.


443
00:22:08.053 --> 00:22:10.345
米尔斯 告诉我 是谁的脸？
Miles, answer me.
Whose face?


444
00:22:10.345 --> 00:22:12.220
我连一点点头绪都没有...
I haven't the slightest idea...


445
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.511
你有吗？
have you?


446
00:22:13.511 --> 00:22:16.928
你...你觉得那玩意有多高？
How tall would you say
that thing is?


447
00:22:16.928 --> 00:22:18.928
哦 大概5英尺10英寸（1米78）左右
Oh, 5'10", thereabouts.


448
00:22:18.928 --> 00:22:20.928
有多重？
How much does it weigh?


449
00:22:20.928 --> 00:22:24.470
比较瘦小
大概140磅
It's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.


450
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.720
杰克身高5英尺10英寸
体重140磅
Jack's 5'10"
and weighs 140 pounds.


451
00:22:30.136 --> 00:22:32.470
泰迪 能不能别再一派胡言了！
Teddy, will you stop
talking nonsense?


452
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:36.470
亲爱的 抱歉
但是我没有乱讲
I'm sorry, darling,
but it isn't nonsense.


453
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.470
贝基 你不认为我在瞎说 是不是？
Becky, you don't think
it's nonsense, do you?


454
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:40.803
当然是瞎说啦
Of course it is.


455
00:22:40.803 --> 00:22:42.470
杰克就在这里 站在你面前啊
Jack's standing here
in front of you.


456
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.886
我当然站在这了 而且正在血流成河
Of course I am,
bleeding to death.


457
00:22:44.886 --> 00:22:46.053
劳驾
Excuse me.


458
00:22:46.053 --> 00:22:47.220
知道吗？
You know what?


459
00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.511
我很遗憾 你保住了性命
I'm afraid you may live.


460
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.011
好了 这样就没事了
Here, this should fix it.


461
00:22:53.011 --> 00:22:54.970
米尔斯 我们要不要报警...
Miles,
shouldn't we call the police...


462
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.970
然后让他们把这具死尸搬走？
and have them take
that dead body out of here?


463
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.970
我很抱歉
这并不是一具尸体
I'm afraid
it isn't just a dead body.


464
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.470
多谢
Thanks.


465
00:23:12.428 --> 00:23:13.928
我很好奇...
I wonder if...


466
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.428
什么？
What?


467
00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:18.261
我好奇
这些事情之间是否有什么关联
I wonder
if there's any connection.


468
00:23:18.261 --> 00:23:20.053
你指的是什么？
What do you mean?


469
00:23:20.053 --> 00:23:22.428
有一些奇怪的事情正在
圣米拉缓缓拉开序幕
There's something
strange afoot in Santa Mira.


470
00:23:22.428 --> 00:23:26.928
考夫曼医生管它叫
传染性的集体歇斯底里性癔病
Dr. Kauffman calls it
an epidemic of mass hysteria.


471
00:23:26.928 --> 00:23:29.428
贝基的表妹就得了这个病
Becky's cousin's got it,
for one.


472
00:23:29.428 --> 00:23:31.678
她认为她的叔叔和婶婶...
She thinks that her uncle
and her aunt...


473
00:23:31.678 --> 00:23:33.428
不再是她的叔叔和婶婶
aren't her uncle and her aunt.


474
00:23:33.428 --> 00:23:35.928
已经出现多例这样的幻想症了
There's several cases
of such delusion.


475
00:23:35.928 --> 00:23:38.928
这个东西还没有完全化身为你的样子...
This isn't you yet...


476
00:23:38.928 --> 00:23:41.928
但从结构上来说显然是及其相近了
but there is
a structural likeness.


477
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:44.678
真不可思议
It's fantastic.


478
00:23:44.678 --> 00:23:46.761
这玩意出现在这里一定有什么原因
There must be some reason
this is here.


479
00:23:46.761 --> 00:23:48.803
要不要坐下来...
Would you be willing
to sit up...


480
00:23:48.803 --> 00:23:50.761
然后等着瞧你这位“朋友”
接下来会发生什么？
and see what your friend's
next move is?


481
00:23:50.761 --> 00:23:54.220
如果到早上还没有什么动静
我们就报警
If nothing happens by morning,
call the police.


482
00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.720
如果发生了些什么呢...
If something happens...


483
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.553
就给我打电话 好吗？
call me, will you?


484
00:23:57.553 --> 00:23:59.220
你知道我会的
You know I will.


485
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.303
晚安 放松点
Good night.
Take it easy.


486
00:24:07.303 --> 00:24:08.470
好的
Sure.


487
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:09.803
不会发生什么的
Nothing will happen.


488
00:24:09.803 --> 00:24:11.053
晚安 贝基
Good night, Becky.


489
00:24:11.053 --> 00:24:12.220
如果真的发生了什么...
If it does...


490
00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.136
一定会是个令人毛骨悚然的
恐怖小说的好素材
it'll make a charming,
bloodcurdling mystery story.


491
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.636
我很谨慎地没有让贝基察觉出来...
I was careful
not to let Becky know...


492
00:24:25.636 --> 00:24:26.928
但当时我真的被吓坏了
but I was really scared.


493
00:24:26.928 --> 00:24:30.136
丹·考夫曼对于
镇上发生的怪事的解释...
Dan Kauffman's explanation
of what was wrong in town...


494
00:24:30.136 --> 00:24:31.511
歇斯底里的集体性癔病...
mass hysteria...


495
00:24:31.511 --> 00:24:34.511
解释不了为什么杰克的台球桌上
会有那样一具躯体
couldn't explain away that body
on Jack's billiard table.


496
00:24:47.636 --> 00:24:50.636
进来吧
我先去开灯
Come in
while I turn the lights on.


497
00:24:50.636 --> 00:24:51.928
你真是个奔放的少妇...
You're a forward wench...


498
00:24:51.928 --> 00:24:53.970
为了强吻我 把我拉到这漆黑的走廊里来
dragging me into a dark hallway
to be kissed.


499
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.261
我把你拉到漆黑的走廊里...
I'm dragging you
into a dark hallway...


500
00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:58.511
是因为今晚我怕黑
because I'm scared of the dark
tonight.


501
00:24:58.511 --> 00:25:00.678
我最好留下来把你裹在怀里
I'd better stay
and tuck you in.


502
00:25:00.678 --> 00:25:02.220
那样就太疯狂了
That way lies madness.


503
00:25:04.261 --> 00:25:06.095
疯狂又怎么啦？
What's wrong with madness?


504
00:25:06.095 --> 00:25:07.928
就是太疯了
晚安
Madness.
Now good night.


505
00:25:15.928 --> 00:25:18.928
想来你俩也该到家了
It's about time
you two got home.


506
00:25:18.928 --> 00:25:21.845
爸 这么晚你在地下室干什么？
Dad, what are you doing
in the basement this late?


507
00:25:21.845 --> 00:25:23.261
整理杂物
Working in my shop.


508
00:25:23.261 --> 00:25:24.511
想来点酒吗 大夫？
Want a nightcap, doc?


509
00:25:24.511 --> 00:25:25.845
不 谢了
时间不早了
No, thanks.
It's kind of late.


510
00:25:25.845 --> 00:25:27.928
改天奉陪
晚安
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.


511
00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:30.928
晚安
Good night.


512
00:25:30.928 --> 00:25:32.928
晚安 米尔斯
Good night, Miles.


513
00:26:04.886 --> 00:26:06.803
啊！
Aaah!


514
00:26:06.803 --> 00:26:08.470
看呐 杰克！
Look, Jack!


515
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.470
它变成你了！是你！
It's you! It's you!


516
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.386
不 不！
千万不要靠近它！
No, no!
You mustn't go near it!


517
00:26:12.386 --> 00:26:14.386
快离开这里！拜托！
Get out of here! Please!


518
00:26:14.386 --> 00:26:15.886
求你！
Please!


519
00:26:16.886 --> 00:26:18.386
米尔斯！
Miles!


520
00:26:19.886 --> 00:26:21.386
发生什么了 杰克？
What happened, Jack?


521
00:26:21.386 --> 00:26:23.886
泰迪说屋里的那个生物变成了我...
Teddy says the thing
in our place is me...


522
00:26:23.886 --> 00:26:26.803
连受伤的割伤都出现了
right down
to the cut on my hand.


523
00:26:26.803 --> 00:26:28.220
我赶紧跑去看它
I didn't wait to look.


524
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.386
它活过来了！是活的！
It's alive! It's alive!


525
00:26:30.386 --> 00:26:32.886
那受伤的伤口在流血！
The hand was cut and bleeding!


526
00:26:32.886 --> 00:26:35.928
位置也挪动了！
And the position
of the body had changed!


527
00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:37.678
来 这里 吃了这个
Here, here. Take this.


528
00:26:42.428 --> 00:26:44.095
我这就给丹尼·考夫曼打电话
I'll call Danny Kauffman.


529
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.886
你好！
Hello?


530
00:27:04.886 --> 00:27:06.095
你好 丹尼？
Hello, Danny?


531
00:27:06.095 --> 00:27:07.261
是的！
Yeah?


532
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:09.553
有情况发生了
我必须立刻见你
Something's happened.
I've got to see you.


533
00:27:09.553 --> 00:27:11.636
你能迅速赶过来吗？
Will you get over here fast?


534
00:27:11.636 --> 00:27:13.678
非常重要的事情
It's important.


535
00:27:13.678 --> 00:27:16.178
哦...好的
Oh... OK.


536
00:27:18.928 --> 00:27:20.095
他在路上了
He's on his way.


537
00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:21.928
我去弄点咖啡就过来
I'll make some coffee
and be right with you.


538
00:27:21.928 --> 00:27:23.345
好主意 米尔斯
谢了
Good deal, Miles.
Thanks.


539
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.178
对了 贝基怎么样？
她没事吧？
What about Becky?
Do you think she's all right?


540
00:27:38.928 --> 00:27:41.636
爸 这么晚你在地下室做什么？
Dad, what are you
doing in the basement this late?


541
00:27:41.636 --> 00:27:43.011
整理杂物
Working in my shop.


542
00:27:45.553 --> 00:27:47.345
我不知道当时是什么情况...
I don't know what it was...


543
00:27:47.345 --> 00:27:48.636
大概是种预感...
call it a premonition...


544
00:27:48.636 --> 00:27:51.636
忽然间 我感受到了贝基身边的危险气息
but suddenly, I had the feeling
that Becky was in danger.


545
00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:53.636
我尽我所能地迅速向她家赶去
I had to get to her
as quickly as possible.


546
00:28:13.678 --> 00:28:15.803
正要按门铃的时候...
I was going
to ring the bell...


547
00:28:15.803 --> 00:28:18.053
突然我的预感告诉我 行事要万分谨慎
but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.


548
00:28:19.178 --> 00:28:20.970
这屋子里有问题
Something was wrong
in this house.


549
00:31:11.053 --> 00:31:12.511
贝基
Becky.


550
00:31:12.511 --> 00:31:15.011
贝基！
Becky!


551
00:31:47.553 --> 00:31:50.053
米尔斯 能告诉我到底发生了什么吗？
Miles, will you tell me
what happened?


552
00:31:50.053 --> 00:31:51.345
同样的东西
The same thing.


553
00:31:51.345 --> 00:31:52.803
我又找到了一具...
I found another one...


554
00:31:52.803 --> 00:31:54.511
在贝基家的地下室里...
in the cellar
at Becky's house...


555
00:31:54.511 --> 00:31:57.053
我站在那里盯着它的时候 它正在活转起来
coming to life
while I stood there watching it.


556
00:31:57.053 --> 00:31:58.553
那是贝基
It was Becky.


557
00:31:58.553 --> 00:32:01.345
是吗？我想看看这两具躯体中的任意一个
Yeah? I want to see
one of these bodies.


558
00:32:01.345 --> 00:32:02.845
好的
All right.


559
00:32:02.845 --> 00:32:05.720
你先上床去休息
你陪着她
You're going to bed,
and you're staying with her.


560
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.011
穿上外衣
我们先去看看杰克的那个
Put on your clothes.
We'll go to Jack's first.


561
00:32:08.011 --> 00:32:09.511
你这有咖啡吗？
Got any coffee around here?


562
00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:12.095
有
厨房里能找到
Yeah.
You'll find some in the kitchen.


563
00:32:12.095 --> 00:32:14.011
他不相信我的话 贝克
He doesn't believe me, Beck.


564
00:32:14.011 --> 00:32:16.178
他会相信的
He will.


565
00:32:28.178 --> 00:32:30.095
有人在耍花招
Somebody's playing games!


566
00:32:30.095 --> 00:32:32.220
这下麻烦了
Rough ones.


567
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.845
这里有一处血迹
There's a blood spot.


568
00:32:34.845 --> 00:32:37.386
你们看到的东西是个被杀掉的可怜的尸体
What you saw was the body
of a murdered man.


569
00:32:37.386 --> 00:32:39.011
仔细检查过了吗？
Did you examine it carefully?


570
00:32:39.011 --> 00:32:40.178
是的
Yes.


571
00:32:40.178 --> 00:32:42.261
我实在不知道它到底发生了什么
I don't know
what's happened to it.


572
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:44.636
那并不是一具普通的尸体
上面没有任何特征
It wasn't an ordinary body.
There wasn't a mark on it.


573
00:32:44.636 --> 00:32:46.761
我也仔细检查过了
连任何蛛丝马迹都没有
I checked it, too.
Not a scratch.


574
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:48.011
有这样一种杀人手法...
You can kill a man...


575
00:32:48.011 --> 00:32:50.053
用削尖的细冰椎刺入大脑的话...
by shoving an ice pick
into the base of his brain...


576
00:32:50.053 --> 00:32:52.595
只会留下一个肉眼几乎看不见的微小创口
leaving a puncture so small
the naked eye can't see.


577
00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:55.220
妈的 你在无视事实真相
这压根就不是一具普通的尸体
You're ignoring the fact
this wasn't a normal body.


578
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.928
而且你也听到泰迪提到它手上的伤口
What about the hand
Teddy mentioned?


579
00:32:56.928 --> 00:33:00.303
泰迪的胡言乱语我听过太多了
全部都是扯淡
I heard lots of things
Teddy said and none made sense.


580
00:33:00.303 --> 00:33:02.511
等等 伙计
当时我也在场
Hold on, pal.
I was here, too.


581
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:04.303
米尔斯也在
So was Miles.


582
00:33:04.303 --> 00:33:06.553
瞧 我们提取了它的指纹
Look, we took his fingerprints.


583
00:33:06.553 --> 00:33:09.470
看看这个吧
告诉我为什么它没有指纹
Look at that.
Tell me why it didn't have any.


584
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:12.095
他不喜欢留下指纹
所以用强酸洗掉了
He didn't want any,
so he took them off with acid.


585
00:33:12.095 --> 00:33:13.845
别试图用常识去解释一切了
Stop trying
to rationalize everything.


586
00:33:13.845 --> 00:33:15.678
我们手边的这事是个谜
We have a mystery on our hands.


587
00:33:15.678 --> 00:33:17.136
是啊 的确是个谜
Sure. A real one.


588
00:33:17.136 --> 00:33:19.636
到底是谁的尸体
并且它现在在哪里
Whose body was it,
and where is it now?


589
00:33:19.636 --> 00:33:21.303
只不过完全是个普普通通的谜题而已
A completely normal mystery.


590
00:33:21.303 --> 00:33:24.136
别管它现在在哪里
这件事绝不会超越人类的经验范围
Whatever it is, it's well within
the bounds of human experience.


591
00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:25.803
而且我也不认为你们能让它超越
Don't blow things
out of proportion.


592
00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:28.178
如果不是因为我在贝基家的地下室看到的东西
我才不会像现在这样
I wouldn't if I hadn't
looked in Becky's cellar.


593
00:33:28.178 --> 00:33:30.011
我在那看到的躯体 你又怎么解释？
How do you explain the body
I saw there?


594
00:33:30.011 --> 00:33:31.636
我不认为你看到了任何东西
I don't think you saw one.


595
00:33:31.636 --> 00:33:32.970
你也不相信我在这看到的？
And the body here?


596
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:35.345
我知道你在这看到了
其他的三个人也都看到了
I know you saw it.
Three others saw it, too.


597
00:33:35.345 --> 00:33:37.095
但另外一个是我梦见的还是什么？
But I dreamed up
the second one?


598
00:33:37.095 --> 00:33:39.178
医生也是会产生幻觉的
Doctors can have
hallucinations, too.


599
00:33:39.178 --> 00:33:41.261
人类的精神是种奇妙的存在
The mind is a strange
and wonderful thing.


600
00:33:41.261 --> 00:33:43.636
甚至也许永远都不能够被完全彻底地解读
I'm not sure it'll ever be able
to figure itself out.


601
00:33:43.636 --> 00:33:46.178
其它的事物或许都可以--
从原子 到宇宙--
Everything else, maybe...
from the atom to the universe...


602
00:33:46.178 --> 00:33:47.595
任何事物 除了人类的精神世界
everything except itself.


603
00:33:47.595 --> 00:33:50.095
不管怎么说
我看到了贝基的分身...
Nevertheless,
I saw Becky's double...


604
00:33:50.095 --> 00:33:51.511
而我们在这里见到的那具躯体...
and the body that we saw here...


605
00:33:51.511 --> 00:33:53.678
化成了令人不舒服的 酷似杰克的东西
bore an uncomfortable
resemblance to Jack.


606
00:33:53.678 --> 00:33:55.345
极度令人不舒服
Mighty uncomfortable.


607
00:33:55.345 --> 00:33:57.720
好吧 让我们去贝基家瞧瞧
Let's go to Becky's
and have a look.


608
00:34:01.511 --> 00:34:04.011
好吧 你女朋友的分身在哪里？
Where's your
girlfriend's double?


609
00:34:04.011 --> 00:34:06.178
好 怀疑论者
打开这个盖子
OK, skeptic,
lift the lid.


610
00:34:17.845 --> 00:34:19.303
有具躯体在里面吧
对吗？
There's a body here,
all right.


611
00:34:19.303 --> 00:34:21.011
- 那就是贝基的分身
- 当然是
- It's Becky's double.
- It sure is.


612
00:34:21.011 --> 00:34:22.345
你再来看看
Take another look.


613
00:34:26.011 --> 00:34:28.761
现在你看
你根本就没在这里看见过什么
Now you see it,
now you don't.


614
00:34:28.761 --> 00:34:31.720
它之前就在那里的--
被那个毯子裹着
It was there...
half-hidden by that blanket.


615
00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.886
你说你是刚刚才在这里看见过的
You said
you saw it there just now.


616
00:34:34.886 --> 00:34:36.053
我以为我看到了
I thought I did.


617
00:34:36.053 --> 00:34:37.970
今晚你为何跑到贝基家里来？
Why did you come here
tonight?


618
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:39.678
你在杰克家看到了一个死人...
You'd seen a dead man
at Jack's...


619
00:34:39.678 --> 00:34:41.011
身材普通的人
an average-sized man.


620
00:34:41.011 --> 00:34:43.178
死去的脸上
线条柔和没有棱角...
The face in death
was smooth and unlined...


621
00:34:43.178 --> 00:34:45.720
表情空洞
这是常有的事
bland in expression,
which often happens.


622
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.178
你只是刚刚才开始注意到...
You had just become aware...


623
00:34:47.178 --> 00:34:50.011
这一场奇怪的 无法用常识解释的
歇斯底里的流行性集体癔病
of a curious, unexplainable,
epidemic mass hysteria.


624
00:34:50.011 --> 00:34:53.178
男人 女人 孩子们
突然都开始坚信...
Men, women, and children
suddenly convinced themselves...


625
00:34:53.178 --> 00:34:55.095
身边的亲人不再是原本的亲人...
that their relatives weren't
their relatives at all...


626
00:34:55.095 --> 00:34:57.345
所以你的意识开始欺骗你...
so your mind
started playing tricks...


627
00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:59.470
现实变得不再真实
and reality became unreality.


628
00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.428
在你眼里那个死人变成了杰克的分身
The dead man became
Jack's double in your eyes.


629
00:35:02.428 --> 00:35:03.595
得了吧 好吗 丹
Come off it, Dan.


630
00:35:03.595 --> 00:35:05.761
我知道这些听起来难以置信...
I know
it's all hard to believe...


631
00:35:05.761 --> 00:35:08.553
但的的确确是可能发生的事情--
哪怕是我这样的巫医也不一定能躲得过
but these things happen...
even to witch doctors like me.


632
00:35:08.553 --> 00:35:11.303
我在这看见她了！
千真万确！
I saw her here!
She was real!


633
00:35:11.303 --> 00:35:13.345
你当然看到了 从每一个细节...
You saw her
in every tiny detail...


634
00:35:13.345 --> 00:35:15.720
就像任何一个人看到
任何其它事物一样的鲜活生动...
as vividly as anyone
has ever seen anything...


635
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.095
但那仅存在于你的脑海中
but only in your mind.


636
00:35:18.095 --> 00:35:20.970
丹尼你可以一整晚都在这里阐述理论
但你说服不了我
Danny, talk all night,
but you're not convincing me.


637
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.636
天啊你们在我家地下室干什么？
What are you doing in my cellar?


638
00:35:25.636 --> 00:35:28.636
用来做诊室
这两位先生是病人...
Using it for an office.
These gentlemen are patients...


639
00:35:28.636 --> 00:35:30.970
急需要精神科的治疗
badly in need
of psychiatric treatment.


640
00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.928
他们一直在做噩梦
They've been having nightmares.


641
00:35:33.928 --> 00:35:35.220
要是喝多了
你们最好现在醒醒酒
If you're drunk,
you'd better sober up quick.


642
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.511
警察正在来这里的路上
The police are coming.


643
00:35:36.511 --> 00:35:37.845
不不 我们没醉
No, we're not drunk.


644
00:35:37.845 --> 00:35:39.970
不是那么简单的事
拿把椅子过来
Nothing that simple.
Pull up a chair.


645
00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.511
怎么了 你们都有毛病吧？
Why, you're all crazy.


646
00:35:41.511 --> 00:35:43.970
嘿 这里发生了什么？
What's going on down there?


647
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.970
你好 尼克
很高兴见到你
Hello, Nick.
Glad to see you.


648
00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:50.011
这两位先生不用专门再跑一趟去警局了
You saved these two characters
a trip to the station.


649
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:53.761
他们想报警 发现了一具尸体
后来它却不见了
They want to report
finding a body and losing it.


650
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:55.511
在哪儿？什么时候？
Where? When?


651
00:35:55.511 --> 00:35:57.553
大概晚上7点左右在我家
At my place about 7:00.


652
00:35:57.553 --> 00:36:00.136
为什么你们时隔这样久才报警？
Why did you
wait so long to report it?


653
00:36:00.136 --> 00:36:01.595
你知道些什么吧 大夫？
You know better than that, doc.


654
00:36:01.595 --> 00:36:05.178
呃 那时一具很诡异的躯体...
It was a curious sort
of a body...


655
00:36:05.178 --> 00:36:08.553
然后 只是突然就找不到它了
and then it wasn't there
anymore.


656
00:36:08.553 --> 00:36:11.970
我有个好主意 你们俩都该进局子了
I have a good mind
to throw you both in jail.


657
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:14.303
如果你看见那玩意
你就会明白为什么我们等了这么长时间
If you'd seen it,
you'd understand why we waited.


658
00:36:14.303 --> 00:36:17.470
瘦小的男人...身高5英尺10英寸...
Thin man... 5'10"...


659
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.386
指纹被强酸抹掉了？
fingerprints burned off
with acid?


660
00:36:19.386 --> 00:36:22.761
刚刚还在太平间看到它
Just seen it on the slab
in the morgue.


661
00:36:22.761 --> 00:36:24.011
出现在一个燃烧的草垛旁边...
Turned up
in a burning haystack...


662
00:36:24.011 --> 00:36:27.470
就两个多小时前 在迈克·加斯纳南边的牧场
on Mike Gessner's south pasture
two hours ago.


663
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:29.886
好了 散了吧！
Now break it up!


664
00:36:29.886 --> 00:36:31.511
各回各家！
Go on home!


665
00:36:38.678 --> 00:36:42.136
好吧 你赢了
收拾走人吧
You win.
Pick up the marbles.


666
00:36:48.678 --> 00:36:51.178
早安
Good morning.


667
00:36:53.678 --> 00:36:56.011
有橙汁
Orange juice.


668
00:36:56.011 --> 00:36:57.886
谢谢
Thank you.


669
00:36:57.886 --> 00:36:59.678
想要吃哪种蛋？
How do you
like your eggs?


670
00:36:59.678 --> 00:37:01.345
你想怎么做就怎么做
Any way you'd like.


671
00:37:01.345 --> 00:37:02.595
煮蛋 两分钟？
Boiled, two minutes?


672
00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:03.761
两分钟？
Two minutes?


673
00:37:03.761 --> 00:37:05.261
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.


674
00:37:05.261 --> 00:37:06.553
好
OK.


675
00:37:07.553 --> 00:37:09.136
知道吗...
You know...


676
00:37:09.136 --> 00:37:12.178
昨晚把你从床上抱走挺麻烦的...
dragging you out of bed
last night was some trouble...


677
00:37:12.178 --> 00:37:13.553
但是很值得
but it was worth it.


678
00:37:13.553 --> 00:37:14.678
说真的 米尔斯
Seriously, Miles.


679
00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:17.636
什么声音？
What was that?


680
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.136
是谁？
Who is it?


681
00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.845
煤气收费员
It's the gas man.


682
00:37:25.845 --> 00:37:27.053
早上好啊大夫
Morning, doc.


683
00:37:28.845 --> 00:37:30.428
早上好 查理
Good morning, Charlie.


684
00:37:30.428 --> 00:37:31.678
我猜我大概有点神经过敏
I guess I'm a little jittery.


685
00:37:31.678 --> 00:37:33.636
睡眠不足的缘故
Not getting enough sleep.


686
00:37:33.636 --> 00:37:35.345
我不会烦扰你的
I won't bother you anymore.


687
00:37:35.345 --> 00:37:37.595
把计费表放在露台了
Putting a meter outside
on the patio.


688
00:37:37.595 --> 00:37:38.803
好的
OK.


689
00:37:38.803 --> 00:37:41.178
天啊 鸡蛋要煮过头了
The eggs will be hard-boiled.


690
00:37:41.178 --> 00:37:42.720
你也会为你丈夫这样做吗？
Did you do this
for your husband?


691
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.886
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.


692
00:37:43.886 --> 00:37:45.595
难道你妻子不会做这些么？
Didn't your wife
do this for you?


693
00:37:45.595 --> 00:37:48.428
当然 她热爱烹饪
Yes. She liked to cook.


694
00:37:48.428 --> 00:37:50.595
这就是我现在为何成了
单身汉的其中一个原因--
That's one of the reasons
why I'm single...


695
00:37:50.595 --> 00:37:53.636
晚餐上桌时
我几乎从未露过脸
I never was there
when dinner was on the table.


696
00:37:53.636 --> 00:37:55.095
所以听我的建议...
Take my advice...


697
00:37:55.095 --> 00:37:56.803
最好别跟医生搞在一起
and don't get mixed up
with a doctor.


698
00:37:56.803 --> 00:37:58.178
他们几乎从不在家
They're seldom at home.


699
00:37:58.178 --> 00:38:00.178
如果我告诉你...
What would you say
if I told you...


700
00:38:00.178 --> 00:38:02.678
我已经跟一名医生搞上了会怎样？
I was already
mixed up with a doctor?


701
00:38:02.678 --> 00:38:05.095
我会说简直美好得令人难以置信
I'd say it was too good
to be true.


702
00:38:05.095 --> 00:38:07.636
这种事情
时常会突如其来地发生
Things like this
can happen all of a sudden.


703
00:38:07.636 --> 00:38:09.053
什么叫“突如其来”？
对于两个...
What's "all of a sudden"
about two people...


704
00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:11.053
几乎已经做了一辈子密友的人
who've been friends
most of their lives?


705
00:38:12.261 --> 00:38:15.220
早安
Good morning.


706
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.511
我想我闻到了咖啡的香味
I thought
I smelled some coffee.


707
00:38:16.511 --> 00:38:17.678
为什么没喊我起床呢？
Why didn't you give me a call?


708
00:38:17.678 --> 00:38:18.970
我不想把泰迪吵醒
I didn't want to wake Teddy.


709
00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:21.720
哦 她早醒了 昨晚睡得很好
She's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.


710
00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.470
不错
Good.


711
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.386
不过我不认为她应该马上跟我回家
But I don't feel
she should go home right away.


712
00:38:26.386 --> 00:38:29.636
介意我们多留一会吗？
Would you mind taking in
boarders for a while?


713
00:38:29.636 --> 00:38:32.970
还是说你有其他别的什么安排？
Or do you have something else
in mind?


714
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.636
我在琢磨一些事情...
I was toying with an idea...


715
00:38:35.636 --> 00:38:37.095
不过你们当然可以留下
but you can stay.


716
00:38:37.095 --> 00:38:38.845
给 杰克
Here, Jack.


717
00:38:38.845 --> 00:38:40.970
谢了 宝贝
我给泰迪送上去
Thank you, doll.
I'll take it to Teddy.


718
00:38:50.803 --> 00:38:53.136
米尔斯 你是否帮我安排了预约...
Miles, did you make
that appointment for me...


719
00:38:53.136 --> 00:38:54.303
跟你的那个精神科医生见面
with the psychiatrist?


720
00:38:54.303 --> 00:38:55.803
是的 2点
Yes. 2:00.


721
00:38:55.803 --> 00:38:58.970
我想不需要了
我觉得自己好蠢
I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.


722
00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.511
我今早一睁眼
觉得什么事都没有了
I woke up this morning,
and everything was all right.


723
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:03.845
- 你都不知道我感到有多轻松
- 是的 我明白
- You don't know my relief.
- Yes, I do.


724
00:39:03.845 --> 00:39:06.511
回去给贝基打个电话告诉她这件事好吗？
她一直好担心你
Will you call Becky
and tell her? She was worried.


725
00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:07.678
好的
All right.


726
00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.178
她现在在我家
She's at your house.


727
00:39:09.178 --> 00:39:10.720
在你家？为什么？
At your house? Why?


728
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.345
一言难尽
不过她会跟你解释的
It's a long story,
but she'll tell you about it.


729
00:39:28.636 --> 00:39:30.803
贝基还在他家
Becky's still at his house.


730
00:39:34.636 --> 00:39:36.095
好吧
All right.


731
00:39:38.303 --> 00:39:39.636
早安啊
Good morning.


732
00:39:39.636 --> 00:39:41.595
早上好 莎莉
Good morning, Sally.


733
00:39:41.595 --> 00:39:44.053
快去瞧瞧谁在会客室
Take a peek at what's
in the reception room.


734
00:39:48.053 --> 00:39:50.511
妈妈 为什么我们不回家呢？
Mother,
why don't we go home?


735
00:39:50.511 --> 00:39:52.261
马上就回去 吉米
In a little while,
Jimmy.


736
00:39:55.678 --> 00:39:58.470
他康复得很迅速嘛
He certainly made
a quick recovery.


737
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.095
我想我们都是这样的
I guess we all have.


738
00:40:04.095 --> 00:40:05.345
但开车回家的路上...
But driving home...


739
00:40:05.345 --> 00:40:07.678
我的脑海中浮现出很多无解的疑问
I had a lot of questions
and no answers.


740
00:40:07.678 --> 00:40:10.636
吉米和威尔玛怎么会在一夜之间恢复常态？
How could Jimmy and Wilma
seem so normal now?


741
00:40:10.636 --> 00:40:12.553
很明显我还没有为他们做任何治疗
Surely I had done nothing
to cure them.


742
00:40:12.553 --> 00:40:16.511
也许他们是想让我安下心来
可是为什么呢？
Maybe they wanted me
to feel secure, but why?


743
00:40:17.845 --> 00:40:19.011
好啊...
Well...


744
00:40:19.011 --> 00:40:21.011
但愿你没忘了买牛排
I hope
you didn't forget the steaks.


745
00:40:21.011 --> 00:40:22.511
我从不忘事
I never forget anything.


746
00:40:22.511 --> 00:40:25.511
别担心他
在这方面他口碑良好
Don't worry about him.
He's completely housebroken.


747
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:27.178
我想来点马提尼  贝克
I need a martini, Beck.


748
00:40:27.178 --> 00:40:28.428
洋葱还是橄榄口味？
Onion or olive?


749
00:40:28.428 --> 00:40:30.720
无所谓
我只是想浇在炭上
Doesn't matter.
I want to pour it on the coals.


750
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.886
这玩意老是点不着
They just won't burn.


751
00:40:31.886 --> 00:40:33.845
哦 马提尼可不够烈
A martini isn't dry enough.


752
00:40:33.845 --> 00:40:36.053
我去帮你找些可以点火用的东西
I'll get you something
that'll start it.


753
00:40:36.053 --> 00:40:37.720
这杯是给你喝的
For drinking purposes.


754
00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:40.845
你的身材看起来真是凹凸有致
You're looking shipshape.


755
00:40:40.845 --> 00:40:42.386
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.


756
00:40:52.303 --> 00:40:53.636
拿来了
Here we are.


757
00:41:16.303 --> 00:41:18.303
杰克！杰克！
Jack! Jack!


758
00:41:22.803 --> 00:41:23.970
呕...
Ugh.


759
00:41:27.845 --> 00:41:30.178
看起来像巨型豆荚！
They're like huge seedpods!


760
00:41:30.803 --> 00:41:33.803
这一定就是形成我家密室里那躯体的玩意！
This must be how that
body in my closet was formed.


761
00:41:35.595 --> 00:41:37.095
米尔斯 它们是哪来的？
Where are they from?


762
00:41:37.095 --> 00:41:39.428
我也不知道
如果是种子或者豆荚那样的东西...
I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods...


763
00:41:39.428 --> 00:41:41.303
它们大概一定是从什么地方的
植物上长出来的
they must grow someplace
on a plant.


764
00:41:41.303 --> 00:41:44.095
并且某些人或者东西
要它们去复制人类的躯体...
And somebody or something wants
this duplication to take place.


765
00:41:44.095 --> 00:41:45.803
但一旦它们完成复制的时候...
But when they're finished...


766
00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:46.970
我们的躯体会发生什么？
what happens to our bodies?


767
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:48.178
我毫无头绪
I don't know.


768
00:41:48.178 --> 00:41:50.345
当整个步骤完成的时候...
我们的本体可能...
When the process is complete,
probably the original...


769
00:41:50.345 --> 00:41:51.845
会被毁灭或瓦解...
is destroyed or disintegrates...


770
00:41:51.845 --> 00:41:52.970
不！等等！
No! Wait!


771
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.470
抱歉
但我可不想亲眼目睹...
Sorry,
but I take a dim view...


772
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:56.095
自己被毁灭的惨剧发生
of watching my own destruction
take place.


773
00:41:56.095 --> 00:41:58.428
在它们完全生长成型之前
暂时不会有什么危险的
There isn't any danger
until they're completely formed.


774
00:41:58.428 --> 00:42:00.220
昨晚在你家咱们已经见识过了
We learned that last night
at your house.


775
00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.220
你并不会马上被统御
Your blank
didn't change right away.


776
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.261
在你沉睡之前都不会
Not until you fell asleep.


777
00:42:06.011 --> 00:42:09.011
米尔斯 如果这种取而代之真的发生了...
Miles, when the change
does take place...


778
00:42:09.011 --> 00:42:11.053
你认为会与本来的我们有什么区别吗？
do you suppose
there's any difference?


779
00:42:11.053 --> 00:42:12.345
一定有
There must be.


780
00:42:12.345 --> 00:42:15.136
威尔玛注意到了
小吉米也发现了
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.


781
00:42:15.136 --> 00:42:17.511
还有我
So did I.


782
00:42:17.511 --> 00:42:19.845
是我父亲...
My father.


783
00:42:19.845 --> 00:42:22.470
这一定是昨晚那时他在...
That must be
what he was doing...


784
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.261
地下室所做的事情
安置这种东西
in the cellar last night...
placing one of these.


785
00:42:25.261 --> 00:42:26.428
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.


786
00:42:26.428 --> 00:42:28.511
我感到有些不对劲...
但我还以为是我自己的问题...
I felt something wrong,
but I thought it was me...


787
00:42:28.511 --> 00:42:30.178
因为我离开家乡太久了
because I'd been away
for so long.


788
00:42:30.178 --> 00:42:32.470
一定要毁掉它们
所有的！
They must be destroyed,
all of them!


789
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:34.053
它们会变成--
每一个...
They will be...
every one of them.


790
00:42:34.053 --> 00:42:36.303
我们现在必须去检查一下镇上所有的建筑...
We're going to have to search every
building


791
00:42:36.303 --> 00:42:37.553
所有的房子
every house in town.


792
00:42:37.553 --> 00:42:39.261
不管男女老少都得接受检查
Men, women, and children
have to be examined.


793
00:42:39.261 --> 00:42:41.803
我们要开始求援了
我留在这看住它们
We've got some phoning to do. I'm going to stay
and watch them.


794
00:42:41.803 --> 00:42:42.970
我陪你一起
I'm staying with you.


795
00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:44.178
千万别报警！
Don't call the police!


796
00:42:44.178 --> 00:42:45.428
尼克·格里维特压根就没有从...
Nick Grivett
didn't find any body...


797
00:42:45.428 --> 00:42:47.011
什么燃烧的干草垛旁边发现任何尸体！
on a burning haystack!


798
00:42:52.678 --> 00:42:54.553
为什么不打电话通知丹尼？没准他能帮上忙
Why don't you call
Danny? Maybe he can help.


799
00:42:54.553 --> 00:42:56.053
丹尼？
Danny?


800
00:42:56.053 --> 00:42:57.220
不
No.


801
00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.011
恐怕现在再联系丹尼 也已经太迟了
I'm afraid it's too late
to call Danny, too.


802
00:42:59.011 --> 00:43:00.470
那你打算怎么办？
What are you going to do?


803
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:01.636
求救
Get help.


804
00:43:01.636 --> 00:43:04.678
但愿现在所发生的一切都还
仅限于在圣米拉的范围内！
I hope whatever's taking place
is confined to Santa Mira!


805
00:43:12.511 --> 00:43:13.678
这里是接线员
Operator.


806
00:43:13.678 --> 00:43:15.845
你好 我是本耐尔医生
这是紧急情况
This is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency.


807
00:43:15.845 --> 00:43:19.011
我想跟洛杉矶的联邦调查局联系
I want to talk to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in L.A.


808
00:43:19.011 --> 00:43:20.428
你确定能让他们相信你的话吗？
Can you convince them?


809
00:43:20.428 --> 00:43:21.761
我别无选择
I've got to.


810
00:43:21.761 --> 00:43:23.386
这些东西到底是从哪儿来的？
Where did they come from?


811
00:43:23.386 --> 00:43:26.178
过去的几年间发现了很多
So much has been
discovered these past few years.


812
00:43:26.178 --> 00:43:27.345
一切皆有可能
Anything is possible.


813
00:43:27.345 --> 00:43:29.178
也许是核辐射...
Maybe the results
of atomic radiation...


814
00:43:29.178 --> 00:43:31.470
对植物或动物产生的影响...
on plant life or animal life...


815
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:35.011
或者是什么诡异的外星生物
或基因突变一类的
some weird alien organism,
a mutation of some kind.


816
00:43:35.011 --> 00:43:37.720
它们为什么要取代人类
也就是我们而存在？
Why should they take the form
of people... of us?


817
00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.845
我不知道
I don't know.


818
00:43:39.845 --> 00:43:41.053
无论是什么...
Whatever it is...


819
00:43:41.053 --> 00:43:42.845
不管是出于智能还是生存本能...
whatever intelligence
or instinct it is...


820
00:43:42.845 --> 00:43:46.511
那玩意能支配它们所形成的人类的血肉之躯...
that can govern the forming
of human flesh and blood...


821
00:43:46.511 --> 00:43:48.386
只需要微薄的空气就可以...
out of thin air is...


822
00:43:48.386 --> 00:43:49.886
简直是令人难以置信地强大...
well,
it's fantastically powerful...


823
00:43:49.886 --> 00:43:52.053
直接超越了人类的理解范围
不堪设想
beyond any comprehension,
malignant.


824
00:43:52.053 --> 00:43:53.303
你家地下室里的那具躯体仅仅只需要...
All that body
in your cellar needed...


825
00:43:53.303 --> 00:43:55.678
拥有一个意识 而且它...
was a mind, and it was...


826
00:43:55.678 --> 00:43:58.136
而且当时我睡着后
它正在尝试偷取我的意识
And it was taking mine
while I was asleep.


827
00:43:58.136 --> 00:44:00.261
我真希望能亲手拿干草叉把它--
I could take
that pitchfork myself, and...


828
00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:02.595
与洛杉矶的联线接通了 大夫...
On your call
to Los Angeles, Doctor...


829
00:44:02.595 --> 00:44:04.136
没有人接电话
they don't answer.


830
00:44:04.136 --> 00:44:06.720
再试试 它们的部门全天无休！
Try again! That office
is open day and night!


831
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.511
如果它们已经占领了电话系统
那我们就完蛋了
If they've taken over
the phone office, we're dead.


832
00:44:24.636 --> 00:44:26.636
那是我码？
Is that me?


833
00:44:56.928 --> 00:44:59.136
这是紧急情况！
紧急情况！
This is an emergency!
Emergency!


834
00:44:59.136 --> 00:45:01.178
听着 这里...喂？
Look, there's been... Hello?


835
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.970
接线员 给我换个好点的线路
Operator,
get me a better connection.


836
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.386
我试试 大夫
I'll try, Doctor.


837
00:45:07.928 --> 00:45:09.095
没用
It's no use.


838
00:45:09.095 --> 00:45:11.095
洛杉矶那边的线路全都断了
All the Los Angeles circuits
are dead.


839
00:45:11.095 --> 00:45:14.011
好吧 试试萨克拉门托那边！
给我接州政府
OK, try Sacramento!
Give me the state capital.


840
00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:16.011
我要跟地方上的官员联系
I want to talk to the governor.


841
00:45:17.845 --> 00:45:20.595
萨克拉门托线路忙 大夫
The Sacramento
circuits are busy, Doctor.


842
00:45:20.595 --> 00:45:22.178
会再回你电话
I'll call you back.


843
00:45:24.053 --> 00:45:25.845
好吧
All right.


844
00:45:25.845 --> 00:45:27.345
好吧 我等你电话
All right.
I'll wait for your call.


845
00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.220
我要把电话拿出去
I'll take the phone outside.


846
00:45:36.845 --> 00:45:38.636
杰克 它们已经占领了电话系统
Jack, they've got the phone.


847
00:45:38.636 --> 00:45:41.595
你和姑娘们开上你的车 先跑路
You and the girls take your car
and make a run for it.


848
00:45:41.595 --> 00:45:43.511
到了附近的第一个镇 赶快求助
First town you get to,
yell for help.


849
00:45:43.511 --> 00:45:44.720
那你呢？
What about you?


850
00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.095
电话很快就会响
That phone
is gonna ring soon.


851
00:45:46.095 --> 00:45:48.553
如果没有人接的话
他们可能会封锁出镇的道路
If nobody answers,
they'll block the roads.


852
00:45:48.553 --> 00:45:49.720
我尽力拖住他们 直到你们走远以后
I'll stall them.


853
00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.011
然后呢
Then what?


854
00:45:51.011 --> 00:45:52.386
试试能否挖出幕后黑手
Try and find out
what's in back of this.


855
00:45:52.386 --> 00:45:54.053
- 我留下
- 不！
- I'm staying.
- No!


856
00:45:54.053 --> 00:45:55.886
米尔斯 别让我离开你
Miles,
don't ask me to leave you.


857
00:45:57.678 --> 00:45:58.845
杰克 快上路吧
Jack, get going.


858
00:45:58.845 --> 00:46:00.386
米尔斯 我不能--
Miles, I can't...


859
00:46:00.386 --> 00:46:01.928
总有人要先走
否则的话我们没办法搬救兵！
Somebody's got to go,
or we don't get help!


860
00:46:01.928 --> 00:46:03.595
拜托 我们快离开这里吧
Please,
let's get out of here!


861
00:46:03.595 --> 00:46:05.303
你们自己保重
Watch out for yourselves.


862
00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.595
到电话那里去 在那呆着
Go over by the phone.
Stay there.


863
00:46:09.595 --> 00:46:10.928
如果电话响了 喊我
If it rings, call me.


864
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:51.636
你好
Hello.


865
00:46:51.636 --> 00:46:53.095
本耐尔大夫在吗？
Is Dr. Bennell there?


866
00:46:53.095 --> 00:46:55.303
- 在 我去叫他
- 不要紧
- Yes. I'll get him.
- Never mind.


867
00:46:55.303 --> 00:46:57.595
请转告他萨克拉门托那边
仍然线路忙就可以了...
Just tell him the Sacramento
circuits are still busy...


868
00:46:57.595 --> 00:46:59.303
再问问他是否需要我继续尝试帮他转接
and ask him if he wants me
to keep trying.


869
00:46:59.303 --> 00:47:00.636
好的 稍等
All right. Hold on.


870
00:47:00.636 --> 00:47:02.761
米尔斯 那边还是线路忙！
Miles,
the circuits are still busy!


871
00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:04.136
让她继续试！
Tell her to keep trying!


872
00:47:04.136 --> 00:47:06.303
还有 再试试三藩市和华盛顿！
Also, try San Francisco
and Washington!


873
00:47:12.595 --> 00:47:14.095
我们现在立即走人
We're getting
out of here right now.


874
00:47:14.095 --> 00:47:15.303
去哪里？
Where are we going?


875
00:47:15.303 --> 00:47:16.470
莎莉家
Sally's!


876
00:47:19.011 --> 00:47:20.970
洛杉矶方面还是接不通
We're still unable
to get through to Los Angeles.


877
00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.345
需要我继续尝试吗？
Do you wish me to keep trying?


878
00:47:23.345 --> 00:47:24.636
本耐尔大夫？
Dr. Bennell?


879
00:47:25.845 --> 00:47:27.511
本耐尔大夫？
Dr. Bennell?


880
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:29.345
我需要个可以信任的人...
I needed
someone I could trust...


881
00:47:29.345 --> 00:47:32.470
然后我发现莎莉
我的护士 是最好的人选
and I figured Sally, my nurse,
was my best bet.


882
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.636
我决定试试给她打电话看看她是否在家
I decided to try to phone her
to see if she was at home.


883
00:47:35.636 --> 00:47:37.636
也许公用付费电话线路还没有被占领
Maybe they hadn't
taken over the pay phones.


884
00:47:37.636 --> 00:47:39.886
我试试付费电话
I'll try the pay phone.


885
00:47:39.886 --> 00:47:41.886
嗨 麦克！
Hey, Mac!


886
00:47:41.886 --> 00:47:43.678
哦 嗨 大夫 你好吗？
Oh, hi, doc.
How are you?


887
00:47:43.678 --> 00:47:46.345
听着 可以赶快帮我加个几加仑吗？
我赶时间
Will you get me
a couple gallons fast?


888
00:47:46.345 --> 00:47:48.511
当然
玛莎 大夫在赶时间
Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry!


889
00:47:48.511 --> 00:47:49.845
你负责刷挡风玻璃 好吗？
Get the windshield, will you?


890
00:47:53.053 --> 00:47:56.053
我得把钥匙拔下来去开油箱
I have to have the keys
to open the gas tank.


891
00:47:58.345 --> 00:48:00.803
这条路那边有病人？
Somebody sick out this way?


892
00:48:00.803 --> 00:48:02.636
那边出了事故
There's been an accident.


893
00:48:02.636 --> 00:48:04.761
有意思 我们还没听到这个消息
Funny.
We haven't heard about it.


894
00:48:04.761 --> 00:48:06.428
呃 刚刚才发生的事情
It just happened.


895
00:48:06.428 --> 00:48:08.886
我还没来得及拨她的号码...
Before I could
even get her number...


896
00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:10.970
就看见麦克靠近了我的车的后备箱
I saw Mac closing
the trunk of my car.


897
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:12.261
他或许是在帮我检查备胎情况...
He could have been
checking my spare tire...


898
00:48:12.261 --> 00:48:13.886
但我不这么想
but I didn't think so.


899
00:48:13.886 --> 00:48:15.053
这样就好了
That should do it.


900
00:48:15.053 --> 00:48:16.261
谢谢你
Thank you.


901
00:48:16.261 --> 00:48:17.470
都搞定了？
All set?


902
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:19.011
- 都搞定了 大夫
- 好的 多谢
- All set, doc.
- Fine. Thanks.


903
00:48:19.011 --> 00:48:21.511
- 记我账上 好吗？
- 当然了 大夫
- Put it on my bill, will you?
- Sure, doc.


904
00:48:41.095 --> 00:48:43.011
怎么了？
What's the matter?


905
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.386
我们得现在赶去莎莉家
We've got to make it
to Sally's house.


906
00:49:21.178 --> 00:49:24.053
我不确定是否再有任何人可以信任了...
I wasn't sure
I could trust anyone...


907
00:49:24.053 --> 00:49:26.553
但无论怎样 我想去莎莉那里碰碰运气
but I took a chance
and drove to Sally's anyway.


908
00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:35.470
当我看到屋子前面停了很多车时...
When I saw several cars
in front of the house...


909
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:37.011
我决定谨慎点
I decided to play it safe.


910
00:49:42.928 --> 00:49:44.220
有什么不对吗？
What's wrong?


911
00:49:44.303 --> 00:49:47.470
也许没有 但还是先不要进去...
直到我确定那边安全为止
Probably nothing,but we're not going
in there until I'm sure it's safe.


912
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.636
握紧方向盘
随时准备立刻开车...
Slide under the wheel
and get out of here fast...


913
00:49:49.636 --> 00:49:51.970
如果有任何人出现来抓我们的话
if anybody shows up
looking for us.


914
00:50:19.136 --> 00:50:20.803
宝宝睡着了吗 莎莉？
The baby asleep yet, Sally?


915
00:50:20.803 --> 00:50:22.761
还没呢
不过就快了...
Not yet,
but she will be soon...


916
00:50:22.761 --> 00:50:24.970
然后就再也不会哭闹了
and there'll be no more tears.


917
00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:26.803
需要我把这个放在她的房间吗？
Shall I put this in her room?


918
00:50:26.803 --> 00:50:28.470
是的 放在她的围床上
Yes. In her playpen.


919
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:31.678
不 等等
也许由我来更好
No, wait.
Maybe I'd better take it.


920
00:50:31.678 --> 00:50:33.095
怎么不进屋去呢 米尔斯？
Why don't you go in, Miles?


921
00:50:33.095 --> 00:50:34.803
我们大家都在等你呢
We've been waiting for you.


922
00:50:41.345 --> 00:50:43.511
贝基 开车！
快！
Becky, start the car!
Quick!


923
00:50:43.511 --> 00:50:45.261
贝基 走！
Becky, get going!


924
00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.720
注意 所有部队...
Attention, all units...


925
00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.636
注意 所有部队--
准备逮捕...
attention, all units...
apprehend and detain...


926
00:51:00.636 --> 00:51:03.511
米尔斯·本耐尔医生和贝基·德里斯科尔...
Dr. Miles Bennell
and Becky Driscoll...


927
00:51:03.511 --> 00:51:04.886
正在向北方前进...
now believed heading north...


928
00:51:04.886 --> 00:51:06.845
开着一辆黑白相间的福特...
in a black and white
Ford sedan...


929
00:51:06.845 --> 00:51:11.970
车牌号2-X-3-7-7-9-6
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.


930
00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:14.095
所有部队准备设置路障...
All units designated
as roadblocks...


931
00:51:14.095 --> 00:51:15.636
各就各位
move to your stations.


932
00:51:15.636 --> 00:51:16.845
情况紧急
It is urgent.


933
00:51:16.845 --> 00:51:18.636
这两个人必须被逮捕...
These two persons
must be detained...


934
00:51:18.636 --> 00:51:20.845
并且绝不允许他们离开圣米拉
and not permitted
to leave Santa Mira.


935
00:51:20.845 --> 00:51:23.053
重复-- 情况紧急...
Repeat... it is urgent...


936
00:51:25.886 --> 00:51:30.636
准备搜寻1955年产的黑白色福特车...
Be on the lookout for a 1955
black and white Ford sedan...


937
00:51:30.636 --> 00:51:35.136
车牌号2-X-3-7-7-9-6
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.


938
00:52:10.345 --> 00:52:12.886
试试能不能赶到我的诊室
We'll try to make it
to my office.


939
00:52:12.886 --> 00:52:14.386
从前面的公路右拐
Cut into that alley
on the right.


940
00:53:45.595 --> 00:53:48.261
他会回来吗？
Do you think he'll come back?


941
00:53:48.261 --> 00:53:51.303
我不认为天亮之前他们会再回来搜查
I don't think they'll
check again before morning.


942
00:53:51.303 --> 00:53:54.386
到那时 杰克应该已经带着援兵赶回来了
By then, Jack should be here
with help.


943
00:53:59.928 --> 00:54:02.761
如果杰克没有撑过去怎么办？
What if
Jack doesn't get through?


944
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:04.345
他一定会扛住的
He's gotta get through.


945
00:54:04.345 --> 00:54:06.220
来 吃两片这个
Here. Take two of these.


946
00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.220
能帮助你保持清醒
They'll help you to stay awake.


947
00:54:25.761 --> 00:54:28.261
我们整晚都绝不能闭眼
We can't close our eyes
all night.


948
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:29.886
也许一睁眼就会变成...
We may wake up changed...


949
00:54:31.303 --> 00:54:33.428
某种邪恶的 非人类的东西
into something evil and inhuman.


950
00:54:35.178 --> 00:54:36.886
在实践中 我见过好多人...
In my practice,
I've seen how people...


951
00:54:36.886 --> 00:54:39.553
逐渐失去人性
have allowed their humanity
to drain away.


952
00:54:39.553 --> 00:54:43.261
只不过 这一过程是缓慢的
而非突如其来地
Only, it happens slowly
instead of all at once.


953
00:54:43.261 --> 00:54:45.136
他们似乎毫不在意
They didn't seem to mind.


954
00:54:45.136 --> 00:54:47.220
那只是少数人而已 米尔斯
But just some people.


955
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.720
我们都一样...一点点的
All of us... a little bit.


956
00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:53.261
心肠日益变硬
逐渐麻木起来
We harden our hearts
and grow callous.


957
00:54:53.261 --> 00:54:55.261
只有到我们必须奋发搏斗
才能保存自己人性的时候...
Only when we have to fight
to stay human...


958
00:54:55.261 --> 00:54:58.928
才能意识到它对我们来说有多么珍贵...
do we realize how precious
it is to us...


959
00:54:58.928 --> 00:55:00.261
多么昂贵...
how dear...


960
00:55:02.803 --> 00:55:04.386
就像你的存在对我的意义
as you are to me.


961
00:55:14.886 --> 00:55:17.178
可能是杰克在找我们
Maybe that's Jack
trying to find us.


962
00:55:17.178 --> 00:55:19.470
他不会笨到打来电话
He'd know better
than to use the phone.


963
00:55:21.178 --> 00:55:22.303
他去哪儿了？
Where is he?


964
00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:24.803
为什么他还不来呢？
Why doesn't he come?


965
00:55:35.803 --> 00:55:37.428
就像每个周六的清晨一样
Just like any Saturday morning.


966
00:55:40.095 --> 00:55:42.678
莱恩·珀尔曼
比尔·比特纳...
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner...


967
00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.428
吉姆·克拉克和他的老婆雪莉
还有孩子们...
Jim Clark and his wife Shirley
and their kids...


968
00:55:46.428 --> 00:55:48.178
我一生中所相识的所有人
people I've known all my life.


969
00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:49.386
几点了？
What time is it?


970
00:55:51.553 --> 00:55:54.428
七点四十五
Seven forty-five.


971
00:55:54.428 --> 00:55:56.470
是的 我懂
Yeah, I know.


972
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:57.761
对于喧嚣的人流来说这也有点太早了
It's too early to be so busy.


973
00:55:57.761 --> 00:56:00.803
他们都在那干什么？
What are they doing here?


974
00:56:00.803 --> 00:56:02.803
有答案了
There's the answer.


975
00:56:02.803 --> 00:56:05.386
那些一定都是刚到镇上的外乡人
There must be strangers in town.


976
00:56:05.386 --> 00:56:08.345
他们得在这儿等车
They're waiting for the bus
to come and go.


977
00:56:08.345 --> 00:56:11.011
只有在十一点的时候下一班才能来
There isn't another one
through here until 11:00.


978
00:57:05.428 --> 00:57:07.511
农夫们
Farmers.


979
00:57:08.761 --> 00:57:12.011
格里马尔迪  皮克斯利...
Grimaldi, Pixley...


980
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:13.345
加斯纳！
Gessner!


981
00:57:13.345 --> 00:57:14.845
新奥尔良市
Crescent City.


982
00:57:14.845 --> 00:57:18.886
如果你在新奥尔良市有亲友 过来拿一个
If you have Crescent City
families, step to truck one.


983
00:57:18.886 --> 00:57:20.928
新奥尔良市的...
Crescent City...


984
00:57:20.928 --> 00:57:22.928
来第一辆车
the first truck.


985
00:57:22.928 --> 00:57:24.428
红岸

986
00:57:24.428 --> 00:57:27.428
所有在红岸有亲友的...
All with Redbank families
or contacts...


987
00:57:27.428 --> 00:57:29.511
到第二辆车这里来
go to truck number two.


988
00:57:29.511 --> 00:57:32.553
所有在红岸有亲友的...
All with Redbank families
or contacts...


989
00:57:32.553 --> 00:57:33.928
第二辆车

990
00:57:33.928 --> 00:57:35.761
哈文赫斯特...
Havenhurst...


991
00:57:35.761 --> 00:57:37.428
第三辆车
the third truck.


992
00:57:37.428 --> 00:57:39.595
哈文赫斯特--
第三辆车
Havenhurst...
the third truck.


993
00:57:39.595 --> 00:57:45.428
米尔斯镇--第三辆车
Mill Town... the third truck.


994
00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:47.428
春泉谷...
Valley Springs...


995
00:57:47.428 --> 00:57:48.928
第三辆车
the third truck.


996
00:57:48.928 --> 00:57:50.720
春泉谷 第三辆车...
Valley Springs...


997
00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.220
先是咱们这个镇...
First our town...


998
00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:55.220
然后是咱们的那些邻镇...
then all the towns around us.


999
00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:56.720
像是传染性的恶疾...
It's a malignant disease...


1000
00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.720
逐渐蔓延到全国范围
spreading through
the whole country.


1001
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.553
今天就这么多
That's all for today.


1002
00:58:00.553 --> 00:58:02.970
准备好明天再来
Be ready again tomorrow.


1003
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:19.428
我没时间等杰克了 你呆在这里
I can't wait for Jack
any longer. Stay here.


1004
00:58:19.428 --> 00:58:20.595
你不是要出去吧
You're not going out there?


1005
00:58:20.595 --> 00:58:22.136
我必须阻止他们！
I've got to stop them!


1006
00:58:22.136 --> 00:58:23.803
等等！我们在这里还是安全的！
Wait! We're safe here!


1007
00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.136
他们不在
但愿咱们来得还不算太迟
They're not here.
I hope we're not too late.


1008
00:58:30.136 --> 00:58:31.636
杰克！谢天谢地！
Jack! Thank God!


1009
00:58:33.053 --> 00:58:35.345
整个镇都被这些豆荚占领了！
The whole town's been
taken over by the pods!


1010
00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:38.845
还没
还剩下你和贝基
Not quite.
There's still you and Becky.


1011
00:58:38.845 --> 00:58:40.845
米尔斯 事情其实会简单很多...
Miles, it would have
been so much easier...


1012
00:58:40.845 --> 00:58:42.303
如果你昨天晚上乖乖去睡觉的话
if you'd gone to sleep
last night.


1013
00:58:42.303 --> 00:58:45.136
放松点
我们是来帮助你的
Relax.
We're here to help you.


1014
00:58:46.803 --> 00:58:48.845
你懂的
You know better than that.


1015
00:58:48.845 --> 00:58:50.345
需要我们将它们放在哪里？
Where do you want us
to put them?


1016
00:58:50.345 --> 00:58:51.720
想看看它们是怎样成长的吗？
Would you like
to watch them grow?


1017
00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:54.095
- 不用 谢了
- 把它们放在这
- No, thanks.
- Put them in there.


1018
00:58:54.095 --> 00:58:57.303
没什么可怕的 我们不会伤害你
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.


1019
00:58:57.303 --> 00:58:59.178
等你明白了
你会感激涕零
Once you understand,
you'll be grateful.


1020
00:58:59.178 --> 00:59:01.470
还记得起初我和泰迪是如何的抗拒它吗？
Remember how Teddy and I
fought against it.


1021
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:02.803
我们错了
We were wrong.


1022
00:59:02.803 --> 00:59:04.303
你是说泰迪不再介意了？
You mean Teddy doesn't mind?


1023
00:59:04.303 --> 00:59:06.803
当然不了 她现在的感觉跟我如出一辙
Of course not.
She feels exactly the way I do.


1024
00:59:06.803 --> 00:59:08.303
放我们走！
Let us go!


1025
00:59:08.303 --> 00:59:09.511
如果我们出了镇子 就不会再回来了
If we leave town,
we won't come back.


1026
00:59:09.511 --> 00:59:13.095
我们可不能放你们走
你们是危险人物
We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.


1027
00:59:13.095 --> 00:59:14.678
别抵抗了 米尔斯
没用的
Don't fight it, Miles.
It's no use.


1028
00:59:14.678 --> 00:59:18.178
不久之后 你们都必须要睡觉的
Sooner or later,
you'll have to go to sleep.


1029
00:59:18.178 --> 00:59:20.803
我在大厅等你
I'll wait for you in the hall.


1030
00:59:20.803 --> 00:59:23.970
米尔斯 你和我一样是学术界人士
Miles,
you and I are scientific men.


1031
00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:26.136
你能明白这发生的一切有多么奇妙
You can understand the wonder
of what's happened.


1032
00:59:26.136 --> 00:59:28.928
仅仅设想一下
不到一个月之前...
Just think.
Less than a month ago...


1033
00:59:28.928 --> 00:59:30.803
圣米拉还跟其它的城镇都一样--
Santa Mira
was like any other town...


1034
00:59:30.803 --> 00:59:32.220
塞满了被烦恼困扰着的人们
people with nothing
but problems.


1035
00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.220
这是突然从天上掉下来了解决之道
Then out of the sky
came a solution.


1036
00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:38.220
这些在太空飘荡了不知多少年的种子...
Seeds drifting through space
for years...


1037
00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.220
在农夫们的田里生了根
took root in a farmer's field.


1038
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.220
从种子里长出了豆荚...
From the seeds came pods...


1039
00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:44.636
能够自我繁衍...
which had the power
to reproduce themselves...


1040
00:59:44.636 --> 00:59:48.345
就像其他任何的生命形式一样
in the exact likeness
of any form of life.


1041
00:59:48.345 --> 00:59:50.845
这就是一切是如何开始的...
So that's how it began...


1042
00:59:50.845 --> 00:59:52.803
...天外来客
out of the sky.


1043
00:59:54.678 --> 00:59:57.678
你的新肉体在里面生长成形
Your new bodies
are growing in there.


1044
00:59:57.678 --> 01:00:00.678
他们会从每一个细胞开始统御你的器官...
They're taking you over
cell for cell...


1045
01:00:00.678 --> 01:00:02.178
从每一个原子
atom for atom.


1046
01:00:02.178 --> 01:00:03.678
没用痛苦
There's no pain.


1047
01:00:03.678 --> 01:00:05.428
一夜之间 在你的睡梦中...
Suddenly, while you're asleep...


1048
01:00:05.428 --> 01:00:08.845
它们将吸收你的意识心智和记忆...
they'll absorb your minds,
your memories...


1049
01:00:08.845 --> 01:00:12.428
然后你就在另外一个没有烦恼的世界重生了
and you're reborn
into an untroubled world.


1050
01:00:12.428 --> 01:00:14.928
千人一面的世界？
Where everyone's the same?


1051
01:00:14.928 --> 01:00:16.886
没错
Exactly.


1052
01:00:16.886 --> 01:00:18.886
真是个好世界
What a world.


1053
01:00:18.886 --> 01:00:21.928
我们并不是唯一幸存的人类
We're not the last humans left.


1054
01:00:21.928 --> 01:00:23.803
剩下的人们会摧毁你们
They'll destroy you!


1055
01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:27.386
等到明天 你就不会希望他们这样做了
Tomorrow,
you won't want them to.


1056
01:00:27.386 --> 01:00:29.386
明天你就是我们中的一员了
Tomorrow, you'll be one of us.


1057
01:00:33.011 --> 01:00:34.511
我爱贝基
I love Becky.


1058
01:00:34.511 --> 01:00:36.970
明天 我还会有同样的感情吗？
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?


1059
01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:39.636
压根就不需要什么爱
There's no need for love.


1060
01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.553
没有情感？
No emotion?


1061
01:00:41.553 --> 01:00:45.886
所以你就没有任何感情
只有生存的本能
Then you have no feelings,
only the instinct to survive.


1062
01:00:45.886 --> 01:00:48.678
你失去了爱或被爱的能力！
我说的对吗？
You can't love or be loved!
Am I right?


1063
01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:50.303
你说的就好像这很可怕一样
You say it
as if it were terrible.


1064
01:00:50.303 --> 01:00:52.970
相信我 一点也不可怕
你又不是没爱过
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.


1065
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:56.470
不存在永恒的爱
从不
It didn't last.
It never does.


1066
01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:00.053
爱，欲望，野心，信仰--
Love, desire, ambition, faith...


1067
01:01:00.053 --> 01:01:03.136
没有这些东西 生活会变得好简单
相信我
without them, life's so simple,
believe me.


1068
01:01:03.136 --> 01:01:06.095
我可不这么想
I don't want any part of it.


1069
01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:07.970
你忘了些事 米尔斯
You're forgetting
something, Miles.


1070
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:09.136
什么？
What's that?


1071
01:01:09.136 --> 01:01:11.428
你没有选择的余地
You have no choice.


1072
01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:18.470
我猜咱们没得选了
I guess we haven't any choice.


1073
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:19.678
不错
Good.


1074
01:01:29.303 --> 01:01:31.886
我想要去爱和被爱！
I want to love and be loved!


1075
01:01:34.678 --> 01:01:36.261
我还想给你生孩子
I want your children.


1076
01:01:36.261 --> 01:01:39.261
我不想活在一个没有爱 悲伤
或者美好的世界！
I don't want a world
without love or grief or beauty.


1077
01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:41.511
我宁可死
I'd rather die.


1078
01:01:41.511 --> 01:01:43.011
不
No.


1079
01:01:43.011 --> 01:01:44.220
不要
Not


1080
01:01:46.886 --> 01:01:49.886
除非没有任何出路了
unless there's no other way.


1081
01:01:49.886 --> 01:01:51.511
为什么他们不能简单地给咱们打一针...
Why didn't they
give us a shot...


1082
01:01:51.511 --> 01:01:54.011
或者吃点安眠药什么的呢？
or a sleeping pill or something?


1083
01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:57.511
药品磨损人的心智
也许是这个原因
Drugs dull the mind.
Maybe that's the reason.


1084
01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:08.678
哦不 行不通
No. It wouldn't work.


1085
01:02:08.678 --> 01:02:11.553
我也许能放倒一两个
但是没把握搞定三个
I might get one or even two,
but I couldn't get three.


1086
01:02:11.553 --> 01:02:13.220
你忘了些什么 亲爱的--有我
You're forgetting something,
darling... me.


1087
01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.428
现在的局面并不是三对一
It isn't three against one.


1088
01:02:14.428 --> 01:02:16.636
而是三对二
给我把刀
It's three against two.
Give me a knife.


1089
01:02:18.011 --> 01:02:19.511
不行
No.


1090
01:03:25.553 --> 01:03:26.720
那边
There.


1091
01:03:35.553 --> 01:03:36.803
到桌子那里去
Go by the desk.


1092
01:03:56.803 --> 01:03:58.803
里面发生了什么？
What's going on in there?


1093
01:03:58.803 --> 01:04:01.470
米尔斯！
把门打开！
Miles!
Unlock the door!


1094
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.178
米尔斯 开门！
Miles, open the door!


1095
01:04:03.178 --> 01:04:04.886
开门 米尔斯！
Open the door, Miles!


1096
01:04:04.886 --> 01:04:06.553
啊！
Aah!


1097
01:04:09.136 --> 01:04:10.303
开门！
Open the door!


1098
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:25.136
噢！啊！
Oh! Aah!


1099
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:27.678
哦！
Oh!


1100
01:04:36.053 --> 01:04:38.470
我们唯一的希望就是开上高速路了
Our only hope is
to make it to the highway.


1101
01:04:51.553 --> 01:04:53.011
呃 这个
That does it.


1102
01:04:53.011 --> 01:04:55.803
唯一的另一条出路是前门...
The only other way
is out the front door...


1103
01:04:55.803 --> 01:04:57.470
而且那边一定有人在看守
and there's bound
to be somebody watching.


1104
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:59.053
我们得碰碰运气
We'll have to chance it.


1105
01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:15.970
眼神放空一点
Keep your eyes
a little wide and blank.


1106
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:17.470
别表现出任何兴趣和激情
Show no interest or excitement.


1107
01:05:41.511 --> 01:05:45.011
好吧 萨姆 我们终于殊途同归了
Well, Sam,
we're finally with you.


1108
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:46.220
他们应该会先通知我的
They were supposed
to let me know.


1109
01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:48.886
头儿说他会先给警察局打电话 然后喊我
The chief said he'd phone
the station, then call me.


1110
01:05:48.886 --> 01:05:51.511
他打过了 但是线路忙
He phoned,
but the line was busy.


1111
01:05:51.511 --> 01:05:53.470
他在重拨
He's calling again now.


1112
01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:56.261
啊！
Aah!


1113
01:05:56.261 --> 01:05:57.761
看车！
Watch out!


1114
01:06:00.511 --> 01:06:02.261
真对不起 米尔斯
I'm sorry, Miles.


1115
01:06:53.928 --> 01:06:55.470
我是雅纳切克
他们跑了
This is Janzek.
They got away.


1116
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:56.678
打开警报
Turn the main siren on.


1117
01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.511
嘿 台阶！
Hey! Stairs!


1118
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:29.970
就几步路了
It's only a few steps more.


1119
01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:45.303
来啊！
他们往这边跑了！
Come on!
They went this way!


1120
01:08:07.053 --> 01:08:09.511
他们在那上面！
They're over there!


1121
01:09:35.553 --> 01:09:37.636
米尔斯 我做不到
Miles, I can't.


1122
01:09:37.636 --> 01:09:39.678
我坚持不下去了
I can't go on.


1123
01:09:39.678 --> 01:09:41.511
你一定行
Yes, you can.


1124
01:10:38.386 --> 01:10:40.553
这是她的外衣！
他们一定在隧道里！
Here's her sweater!
They must be in the tunnel!


1125
01:10:50.511 --> 01:10:53.345
看 汤米
你从那边追！
Look, Tommy,
you go that way!


1126
01:10:59.845 --> 01:11:02.886
放弃吧！
你们逃不掉的！
Give up!
You can't get away from us!


1127
01:11:02.886 --> 01:11:06.553
我们不会伤害你们的
放弃吧！
We're not going to hurt you!
Give up!


1128
01:11:17.178 --> 01:11:18.761
他们没在隧道里
They're not in the tunnel.


1129
01:11:18.761 --> 01:11:20.970
好吧 大伙儿 出来吧
来
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on.


1130
01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:23.470
去山上搜查一下
大伙儿 走 起来
Let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.


1131
01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:34.428
米尔斯 我感到无法再保持清醒了
Miles,
I can't stay awake much longer.


1132
01:11:36.095 --> 01:11:38.845
我想他们应该都走了
I think they're all gone now.


1133
01:11:38.845 --> 01:11:42.220
我们必须动身了
否则的话就永远也上不了高速了
We'd better start, or we'll
never make it to the highway.


1134
01:12:40.428 --> 01:12:43.886
米尔斯 我从未听到过这样美好的声音
Miles, I've never heard
anything so beautiful.


1135
01:12:43.886 --> 01:12:45.261
那说明我们并不是唯一仅存的...
It means we're not
the only ones left...


1136
01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.386
懂得什么是爱的人类
to know what love is.


1137
01:12:47.386 --> 01:12:50.595
呆在这 并祈祷他们确实是人类
就像听起来的那样
Stay here, and pray
they're as human as they sound.


1138
01:12:50.595 --> 01:12:51.970
再见 亲爱的
Bye, darling.


1139
01:13:46.428 --> 01:13:50.470
这里是KCAA电台
您二十四小时无休的欢乐唱机...
This is station KCAA,
the 24-hour platter parade...


1140
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:51.761
音乐电台--
the station of music...


1141
01:14:22.386 --> 01:14:23.553
贝基
Becky.


1142
01:14:25.886 --> 01:14:27.095
贝基！
Becky!


1143
01:14:31.886 --> 01:14:33.053
贝基？
Becky?


1144
01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:36.928
贝基 你在哪儿？！
Becky, where are you?!


1145
01:14:36.928 --> 01:14:38.636
我在这里 米尔斯
I'm here, Miles.


1146
01:14:41.428 --> 01:14:43.428
你没睡着吧？
You didn't go to sleep?


1147
01:14:43.428 --> 01:14:44.928
我好累
I'm so tired.


1148
01:14:44.928 --> 01:14:48.136
他们不是人
外面有很多他们的人
They weren't people.
It was more of them.


1149
01:14:48.136 --> 01:14:49.845
他们正在温室培育数以千计的豆荚
They're growing thousands
of pods in greenhouses.


1150
01:14:49.845 --> 01:14:51.761
我们必须逃跑
We've got to get away.


1151
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:53.803
我精疲力尽了 米尔斯
I'm exhausted, Miles.


1152
01:14:53.803 --> 01:14:55.803
我做不到了
I can't make it.


1153
01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:14.970
不睡一觉的话 我们都做不到的
We can't make it
without sleep.


1154
01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:18.803
是的 我们能行
Yes, we can.


1155
01:15:35.303 --> 01:15:39.303
我睡着了 米尔斯
然后那个发生了
I went to sleep,
Miles, and it happened.


1156
01:15:39.303 --> 01:15:41.095
噢 贝基...
Oh, Becky.


1157
01:15:42.928 --> 01:15:44.261
他们说得对
They were right.


1158
01:15:44.261 --> 01:15:46.261
我不该离开你的...
I should never have left you.


1159
01:15:46.261 --> 01:15:48.970
别像个蠢货一样了
米尔斯 接受我们吧
Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.


1160
01:15:50.803 --> 01:15:52.136
不
No.


1161
01:15:53.511 --> 01:15:54.970
绝不！
Never!


1162
01:15:54.970 --> 01:15:58.595
他在这里！
He's in here!


1163
01:15:58.595 --> 01:16:00.720
抓住他！抓住他！
Get him! Get him!


1164
01:16:08.970 --> 01:16:11.845
在我的生命中 有过很多害怕的时候...
I've been afraid
a lot of times in my life...


1165
01:16:11.845 --> 01:16:13.761
但我从未体会到恐惧的真正含义...
but I didn't know
the real meaning of fear...


1166
01:16:13.761 --> 01:16:17.845
直到当时亲吻贝基的那刻
until I had kissed Becky.


1167
01:16:17.845 --> 01:16:20.261
只是短暂地陷入了睡眠
然后我所深爱的女孩就...
A moment's sleep,
and the girl I loved...


1168
01:16:20.261 --> 01:16:23.011
变成了一心要置我于死地的异类敌人
was an inhuman enemy
bent on my destruction.


1169
01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:25.470
那一刻的短暂入眠
扼杀了贝基的灵魂...
That moment's sleep
was death to Becky's soul...


1170
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:27.178
就像杰克和泰迪身上发生的一样...
just as it had been
for Jack and Teddy...


1171
01:16:27.178 --> 01:16:29.053
还有丹·考夫曼和其他所有的人
and Dan Kauffman
and all the rest.


1172
01:16:29.053 --> 01:16:30.636
他们的肉体现在已经了宿主...
Their bodies were now hosts...


1173
01:16:30.636 --> 01:16:34.053
而里面藏匿的是外星生物
某种来自宇宙的生命形式...
harboring an alien form
of life, a cosmic form...


1174
01:16:34.053 --> 01:16:36.803
那种为了生存
必须取代和统御所有人类存在的生命
which, to survive,
must take over every human man.


1175
01:16:36.803 --> 01:16:38.595
所以我就跑 一直跑...
So I ran, I ran...


1176
01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:41.053
就像小吉米那天一样夺命狂奔
I ran as little Jimmy
had run the other day.


1177
01:16:41.053 --> 01:16:43.220

left in Santa Mira!


1197

你疯了吗？大蠢货！
Are you crazy,
you big idiot?


1203

Look!
You fools! You're in danger!

1211
01:18:32.636 --> 01:18:35.720
你一个字都不相信 是吧？
You don't believe
a word of this, do you?


1212
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.345
当然 我知道这听起来很奇异
但是它实实在在的发生了！
Sure, it's fantastic,
but it happened.


1213
01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:39.511
别只是坐在那里用
正在估量拘束衣尺寸的眼神看我！
Don't just sit there
measuring me for a straitjacket!

唉！什么都没用！
What's the use?


1216
01:19:01.553 --> 01:19:04.553
你认为精神理疗会有效吗？
What do you think?
Will psychiatry help?


1217
01:19:04.553 --> 01:19:07.303
如果他说的这些仅仅是个噩梦的话 会的

01:19:07.303 --> 01:19:08.636
当然只是个噩梦啦
Of course it's a nightmare.


1219
01:19:08.636 --> 01:19:11.636
异世界来的植物取代地球上的人类
Plants from another world
taking over human beings.


1220
01:19:11.636 --> 01:19:13.220
像三月的野兔一样疯狂
Mad as a March hare.


1221
01:19:16.386 --> 01:19:18.303
这是什么情况？
What have we here?


1222
01:19:18.303 --> 01:19:20.011
他开着大卡车闯红灯

through a red light.


1223
01:19:20.011 --> 01:19:21.970
被一辆灰狗长途车从侧面撞到了...
Greyhound bus
smacked him broadside...


1224
01:19:21.970 --> 01:19:23.220
翻了车

1225
01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.636
把他送到手术室

1226
01:19:24.636 --> 01:19:26.428

当然
Certainly.


1228
01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.136
伤得有多重？
How badly is he hurt?


1229

双腿和左臂 全部粉碎性骨折
Both legs, left arm,
broken all to bits.


1230
01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.386
我们当时得把他...
We had to dig him out...


1231
01:19:34.386 --> 01:19:38.011
从一堆非常奇异
见所未见的东西下面挖出来
from under the most
peculiar things I ever saw.


1232
01:19:38.011 --> 01:19:39.345
什么东西？
What things?


1233
01:19:39.345 --> 01:19:40.511
我不知道那些事什么玩意
I don't know what they are.


1234
01:19:40.511 --> 01:19:42.136
我从没有见过那样的东西
I never saw them before.


1235
01:19:42.136 --> 01:19:45.095
看起来就像 呃...
超级巨型豆荚
They looked like, uh,
great big seedpods.


1236
01:19:45.095 --> 01:19:47.428
豆荚？
Seedpods?


1237
01:19:47.428 --> 01:19:48.970
这卡车是从哪里来的？
Where was the truck
coming from?


1238
01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:50.303
圣米拉
Santa Mira.


1239
01:19:55.636 --> 01:19:58.970
打开电台

agency in the state.


1242

Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
