If you are lucky,
a dog will come into your life

steal your heart and change everything.

3
00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:28.421
Can't believe that I made it.

4
00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:33.070
Can't believe that I
made it this far at all.


5
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.337
Didn't mean to, but I had to.

6
00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:41.153
Now I've got to, 
I must keep running on.

7

Overnight, I'm free.

In the morning, who knows where I'll be.

9

Oh my, I'm a
little scared, but I'm free!

10
00:03:50.778 --> 00:03:52.671
Run, run, run, for your life.

11
00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:54.546
Leave it all behind you and fly.

12
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.695
Fast as you can, girl, no holding back.

13
00:03:58.778 --> 00:04:00.379
Run, run, run, don't be scared.

14
00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:04.236
Everything around you is brand new,
so take it in.


15
00:04:04.986 --> 00:04:06.653
Who knows what you'll find.

16
00:04:08.903 --> 00:04:10.945
Who knows what you'll find.

17
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:25.837
It's so bright outside,
not like when I was tied up inside.


18
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:28.361
This is amazing!

19

Run, run, run, don't be scared.

Ooooh... I can't believe that I'm free.

[PEOPLE WHO LITTER HERE ARE DOGS]

28
00:05:05.403 --> 00:05:07.570
Now all I have to
do is keep on going.

29
00:05:08.195 --> 00:05:10.361
Just keep on going.

30

In the morning, who knows where I'll be.

32

Oh my! I'm a
little scared, but I'm free!

33
00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:23.611
Hey, dog... stop!

34
00:05:25.653 --> 00:05:29.070
Finally, I'm free.

35
00:05:33.736 --> 00:05:37.129
Now I'm free.

00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:40.570
Who knows where I'll be.

37
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.153
Before bad luck strikes,
it apparently gives one a preview.


38
00:06:39.278 --> 00:06:40.653
I am Dharma.

39
00:06:41.445 --> 00:06:43.695
I wake up before the alarm rings.

40
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:46.361
Yet, it strikes everyday.

41
00:06:47.403 --> 00:06:48.570
And I strike back.

42
00:06:52.236 --> 00:06:53.921
My mother would always say...

43
00:06:53.945 --> 00:06:57.986
What you dream of at dawn,
comes true. Always.


44
00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:09.653
In my opinion, I'm right.
It's people's perception of me that is wrong.


45
00:07:24.403 --> 00:07:24.629
Hello.

46
00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:27.379
Hello sir.
I'm calling from Spencer 4G Company.


47
00:07:27.403 --> 00:07:30.087
We have some new
Internet offers on 4G. Can I..


48

I already have it.

Damn! Flat tyre again!

51
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:14.778
What's up Krupakar sir?

52
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.486
Looks like there was trouble
at home last evening?


53
00:08:18.028 --> 00:08:20.403
When you have a family,
these things are common. Isn't it?


54
00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:25.403
The only way to be trouble free
is to lead a lonely existence.


55
00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:29.278
Does he have a problem
because I have an easy life?


56
00:08:29.778 --> 00:08:31.861
Or does he have a problem
because he has a family?


57
00:08:31.986 --> 00:08:33.445
I still haven't understood.

58
00:08:35.778 --> 00:08:37.528
Not because I'm incapable of it.

59
00:08:39.403 --> 00:08:40.483
I just don't have the time.

60
00:08:43.028 --> 00:08:45.796
I don't usually mingle with people.

61
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.528
Yet, there are always people behind me.

62
00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:51.278
Dharma...

63
00:08:52.028 --> 00:08:56.361
This is Uttam. Uttam, meet Mr. Dharma.
You'll be under him for training.


64
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.320
He is our best employee, okay?
Dharma, what will you start training him in?


65
00:09:01.653 --> 00:09:03.337
I'll begin with training
him in punctuality.


66
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:07.736
Ah! Get used to
Dharma, okay? All the best.

67
00:09:09.945 --> 00:09:14.712
Sir, I had a flat tyre on the way here.
Nobody offered me a ride.


68
00:09:14.736 --> 00:09:17.361
An idiot even showed me the finger!

69
00:09:17.653 --> 00:09:19.320
My situation...

70
00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:32.903
What? Him? Really?

71
00:09:33.611 --> 00:09:35.361
How will you ever learn under him?

72
00:09:36.486 --> 00:09:39.528
Why? Isn't that possible?

73
00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:42.945
Murali sir said he is the best employee.

74
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:48.445
Just because he never takes leave and works 365 days,
he becomes the best employee?


75
00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:52.236
No wife or kids. 
Never entertains anybody.

76
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:55.986
If not the factory,
where else will he go?


77
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.778
If he had a family,
he'd have known the reality.


78
00:10:00.986 --> 00:10:03.111
Best employee, my foot!

79
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.528
Looks like they aren't
the best of friends. Right?


80
00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:15.320
He has no friends here.

81
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.254
Quoting him as an example,

82
00:10:17.278 --> 00:10:19.903
Krupakar's promotion has been
overdue since 3 years.


83
00:10:20.236 --> 00:10:21.945
That's why he's jealous of Dharma.

84
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.320
Like I said,

85
00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:27.570
there are people behind me.

86
00:10:28.945 --> 00:10:29.945
Always.

87
00:10:30.778 --> 00:10:31.903
Only to speak ill of me.

88
00:10:39.611 --> 00:10:40.879
Look Dharma is here.

89
00:10:40.903 --> 00:10:41.921
Don't bother grandpa!

90
00:10:41.945 --> 00:10:43.962
Hey Batani, you don't get it!

91
00:10:43.986 --> 00:10:47.778
He's been absolutely useless!
Let him at least do this.


92
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.695
Hey Dharma!

93
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:56.861
Aren't you too from this colony?

94
00:10:57.236 --> 00:11:02.854
Some idiot is distributing
TV sets in our colony ground!


95
00:11:02.878 --> 00:11:07.461
How can I teach music
with his voice blaring on the speaker!


96
00:11:08.545 --> 00:11:12.229
He is holding an orchestra
this evening. Come with us.


97
00:11:12.253 --> 00:11:14.003
I have no interest in coming with you.

98
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.170
Hey! I'm not asking you
to attend the orchestra.


99
00:11:19.545 --> 00:11:22.937
I'm asking you to join
us in confronting him.


100
00:11:22.961 --> 00:11:25.295
Come, let's go thrash him!

101
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:32.170
When someone asks for my help,
I never send them empty handed.


102
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.628
I always give them an earful.

103
00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:39.628
Aren't I leading a happy life
without anybody's help?


104
00:11:40.628 --> 00:11:41.711
I am content.

Don't you know he doesn't want to come?

111

You get ready.

112

Shantamma, my son passed his exams
only because of my prayers.


139
00:16:49.295 --> 00:16:52.771
The Lord always gives
when you ask him earnestly.


140

What's the big deal about God
giving you something after asking for it?


141
00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:58.628
There's no need to go begging to him.

how will he give it back?

Dharma sir, are you
going to the bhajan tonight?


160
00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:33.461
I want only two idlis.

161
00:18:59.753 --> 00:19:00.753
Good morning, sir.

162
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:10.896
Only two idlis.

163
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.920
Sure son.

164
00:19:26.128 --> 00:19:30.920
Home. Factory. Fights.
Idli. Cigarette. Beer.


165
00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:33.211
That's what my life is all about.

166
00:19:33.503 --> 00:19:34.711
Nothing interesting.

167
00:19:47.253 --> 00:19:50.545
Let's go faster.
Dharma is alone at home.


168
00:19:51.795 --> 00:19:52.961
Damn these rains!

169
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.795
He'll be watching TV. Don't worry.

170
00:20:00.586 --> 00:20:01.795
How is the ice-cream sweety?

171
00:20:02.045 --> 00:20:03.045
Nice pappa!

172
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.437
We have 5 ice-creams.

173
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:08.771
One for you, one for my brother.
None for pappa.


174
00:20:08.795 --> 00:20:10.920
And 3 for me, okay?

175
00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:12.646
Promise?

176
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:13.271
Yes.

177
00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:14.479
Say it loud!

178
00:20:14.503 --> 00:20:15.503
Promise...

179
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.170
[WAKES UP STARTLED]

180
00:21:08.253 --> 00:21:10.003
Get lost!

181
00:21:31.795 --> 00:21:32.795
Newspaper!

182
00:21:44.211 --> 00:21:45.211
Out!

183
00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:12.312
Uncle...

184
00:22:12.336 --> 00:22:13.336
Ball.

185
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.128
Come let's go tell dad that
Hitler uncle burnt the ball.


186
00:22:26.336 --> 00:22:30.670
Hey Dharma,
there's warm breakfast at home. Come eat.


187
00:22:33.795 --> 00:22:37.211
There's no greater tragedy than not finding
food when you're hungry.


188
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.729
Didn't I tell you about the
tragedy of not finding food?


189
00:22:47.753 --> 00:22:50.003
Now there's a greater
tragedy that awaits me.


190
00:23:06.336 --> 00:23:08.711
Why the hell is this dog following me?

191
00:23:11.253 --> 00:23:14.045
If it comes inside the house,
I will not spare it!


192
00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.312
Oh god!
Vicky has hurt himself!


193
00:23:57.336 --> 00:23:58.896
Come quickly!

194
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.461
What happened Vicky?

195
00:24:31.795 --> 00:24:34.045
Bikes are to
be rode on two wheels.


196
00:24:34.253 --> 00:24:36.187
Yes, because it
has only two wheels uncle!


197
00:24:36.211 --> 00:24:38.586
Exactly. Ride it on both wheels.

198
00:24:39.378 --> 00:24:41.271
So if you do wheeling,

199
00:24:41.295 --> 00:24:42.295
this is what happens.

200
00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.586
Why are you scolding my son for it?
It's all this dog's fault!


201
00:24:46.836 --> 00:24:49.545
Okay. Should we
take him to the hospital?


202
00:24:49.586 --> 00:24:50.586
No uncle.

203
00:24:55.753 --> 00:24:58.503
Stray dogs have become a menace!

204
00:24:59.878 --> 00:25:03.687
This dog has
made a mess of this place.


205
00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:04.854
Yes.

206
00:25:04.878 --> 00:25:06.687
This was well deserved.

207
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:10.795
The kids always play here.
What if it had bitten them?


208
00:25:11.753 --> 00:25:15.812
Call the civic authorities,
they'll take this dog away.


209
00:25:15.836 --> 00:25:16.437
Let's go.

210
00:25:16.461 --> 00:25:18.086
The dog is still breathing. Damn it.

211
00:25:32.711 --> 00:25:36.687
Why are you taking it, son?
The local authorities will do it.


212
00:25:36.711 --> 00:25:38.812
Let him take it.

213
00:25:38.836 --> 00:25:43.562
Let's please take it
to the hospital. Please dad.


214
00:25:43.586 --> 00:25:44.920
Keep quiet!

215
00:25:57.545 --> 00:25:58.545
Let's go in.

216
00:26:03.545 --> 00:26:07.420
Give a dose each
in the morning, noon and night.


217
00:26:07.836 --> 00:26:10.812
- And this syrup twice a day.
- Okay.


218
00:26:10.836 --> 00:26:15.687
Bathe the dog with this shampoo
for silky, smooth fur.


219
00:26:15.711 --> 00:26:18.437
Today's generation are blind
when they're riding.


220
00:26:18.461 --> 00:26:20.670
My boy, at least you should've been alert.

221
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.111
Always look to your left and right
when you cross the road.


222
00:26:24.528 --> 00:26:26.153
Sir, he's here.

223
00:26:28.111 --> 00:26:29.153
This guy?

224
00:26:29.695 --> 00:26:30.962
Tell him I don't
want to talk to him.

225
00:26:30.986 --> 00:26:32.046
Not a word.

226
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.445
Sir, he doesn't want to speak to you.
He's angry.


227
00:26:34.695 --> 00:26:35.546
Why should I?

228
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.695
He can't look after such a nice dog?
He only wants to show off!


229
00:26:39.403 --> 00:26:40.403
This dog isn't mine.

230
00:26:40.445 --> 00:26:42.361
What?
Lying to me?


231
00:26:42.653 --> 00:26:44.733
I can identify the owner
just by looking at the dog.


232
00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:46.754
Do you know how many
years of experience I have?


233
00:26:46.778 --> 00:26:48.736
He doesn't know of my expertise!

234
00:26:50.653 --> 00:26:53.736
I'll give it an injection.
And my job is done.


235
00:27:03.695 --> 00:27:05.736
Look at how scared
it is of the needle!

236
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:09.236
Has it been injected before?

237
00:27:09.611 --> 00:27:10.962
Don't you get it?

238
00:27:10.986 --> 00:27:12.653
This dog is not mine.

239
00:27:15.778 --> 00:27:18.111
Nothing to worry.

240
00:27:24.445 --> 00:27:26.320
The pictures have turned out great, right?

241
00:27:26.695 --> 00:27:29.195
I have this thing for animals...

242
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.070
What is it called again?

243
00:27:32.903 --> 00:27:33.445
Madness.

244
00:27:33.778 --> 00:27:34.778
Ha.

245
00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:35.903
No.

246
00:27:35.986 --> 00:27:36.986
Passion

247
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.587
I'm just like you!

248
00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:41.379
I can't bear to see any
animal suffering on the road.


249
00:27:41.403 --> 00:27:43.278
I bring it here and treat it.

250
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.403
By the way, which road
did I find you in?

251
00:27:45.861 --> 00:27:46.861
Tablets.

252
00:27:47.653 --> 00:27:48.778
He's irked!

253
00:27:50.528 --> 00:27:52.528
Let's get to business now.

254
00:27:53.486 --> 00:27:54.962
Give these tablets thrice a day.

255
00:27:54.986 --> 00:27:57.504
Your dog will be fine in no time.

256
00:27:57.528 --> 00:27:58.528
Hold on.

257
00:27:58.945 --> 00:28:01.087
Didn't I tell you it's not mine?

258
00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:03.421
What's the fee? I'm off.

259
00:28:03.445 --> 00:28:04.445
What about the dog?

260
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:07.611
Keep it here with you.

261
00:28:08.236 --> 00:28:12.236
How?
I'm unable to handle our own.


262
00:28:12.528 --> 00:28:16.070
If the owner gets to know
I've got another dog, he'll kick up a fuss.


263
00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.528
Sir.

264
00:28:18.153 --> 00:28:19.153
Try and understand.

265
00:28:20.486 --> 00:28:21.820
I can't look after it.

266
00:28:22.361 --> 00:28:24.028
Why? Are you scared of dogs?

267
00:28:24.778 --> 00:28:28.337
Doctor, looks like he has cynophobia.
Your brother-in-law had the same problem.


268
00:28:28.361 --> 00:28:29.337
Who is the doctor? You or me?

269
00:28:29.361 --> 00:28:29.712
You.

270
00:28:29.736 --> 00:28:31.070
Then shut up, will you?

271
00:28:31.736 --> 00:28:34.695
Do one thing. Take the dog with you.

272
00:28:34.861 --> 00:28:39.587
I get a lot of calls for adoption.
I'll set one up for you.


273
00:28:39.611 --> 00:28:41.421
Just four days.

274
00:28:41.445 --> 00:28:44.337
Dogs are not allowed in our colony.
What if someone gets to know?


275
00:28:44.361 --> 00:28:48.278
How will anyone get to know
if you hide this pup in your home?


276
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.754
Then why don't you do it?
Hide it here.


277
00:28:50.778 --> 00:28:51.879
And don't let the owner find out.

278
00:28:51.903 --> 00:28:54.611
No way. It won't work.
He'll definitely get to know.


279
00:28:55.278 --> 00:28:56.278
He is the owner.

280
00:28:57.445 --> 00:28:58.754
Did he ask you that?

281
00:28:58.778 --> 00:29:00.195
Can't you shut up?

282
00:29:03.153 --> 00:29:05.337
So what do we do now?

283
00:29:05.361 --> 00:29:07.546
Abandon it on the street?

284
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:13.046
What if it dies under a vehicle?
Won't your good deed get wasted?


285
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.611
Just four days. That's all.

286
00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:16.504
Give me your number now.

287
00:29:16.528 --> 00:29:18.236
The good deed and the dog.

288
00:29:19.486 --> 00:29:20.486
Keep them both.

289
00:29:39.653 --> 00:29:42.837
What do you take me for? A joker?

290
00:29:42.861 --> 00:29:46.111
Please don't shout.
I'm due for a promotion.


291
00:30:00.528 --> 00:30:01.528
Puppy!

292
00:30:12.361 --> 00:30:13.361
Okay!

293
00:30:49.195 --> 00:30:51.070
Hey.. Shush!

294
00:30:53.236 --> 00:30:56.087
Dharma was living a carefree life.

295
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:58.820
But then came this spoiler.

296
00:30:58.903 --> 00:31:01.546
A barking drama.

297
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.695
Causing inner fear.

298
00:31:04.528 --> 00:31:09.962
Everyone usually allow ants
unknowingly into their surroundings.


299
00:31:09.986 --> 00:31:15.278
Here this person allowed in a dog
that was wandering on the streets.


300
00:31:15.778 --> 00:31:21.546
He is single and a recluse.

301
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:27.236
Too rough with a very short fuse.

302
00:31:37.778 --> 00:31:38.778
Repeat.

303
00:32:25.445 --> 00:32:26.445
Hi.

304
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.379
What?

305
00:32:28.403 --> 00:32:29.403
Puppy!

306
00:32:31.278 --> 00:32:32.278
What?

307
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.903
The puppy was in the park!

308
00:32:34.778 --> 00:32:35.403
Really?

309
00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:36.653
Yes!

310
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.320
It's still there, right?

311
00:32:40.486 --> 00:32:41.486
Then?

312
00:32:41.778 --> 00:32:42.778
It's here!

313
00:32:46.778 --> 00:32:51.754
What can you do
if your fate is twisted?

314
00:32:51.778 --> 00:32:57.837
Even a dog can become your enemy

315
00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:03.421
I have put up the
dog on OLX for free

316
00:33:03.445 --> 00:33:06.337
I'm done with feeding this dog.

317
00:33:06.361 --> 00:33:09.212
Tending it and fostering it round the clock.

318
00:33:09.236 --> 00:33:14.879
Oh god, this is such a notorious dog.

319
00:33:14.903 --> 00:33:21.070
Please save me my lord!

320
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.820
Repeat.

321
00:34:08.903 --> 00:34:09.903
Go in!

322
00:34:11.653 --> 00:34:13.195
Uncle...

323
00:34:13.653 --> 00:34:14.820
Ball.

324
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.790
Don't tell anybody that there's a dog here.

325
00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:25.671
What are you kids doing there?

326
00:34:25.695 --> 00:34:29.087
Nothing much.
Uncle's dog snatched our ball.


327
00:34:29.111 --> 00:34:30.921
A dog?

328
00:34:30.945 --> 00:34:36.587
Despite tying a stick to the tail
it's still crooked.


329
00:34:36.611 --> 00:34:41.653
Right now, I am the one feeling sour.

330
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:47.712
A tail to wag,
a mouth to create ruckus.

331
00:34:47.736 --> 00:34:50.587
A torture so impossible to bear.

332
00:34:50.611 --> 00:34:53.504
What do I do, I'm exasperated

333
00:34:53.528 --> 00:34:58.796
I think, I am down with fever.

334
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:04.278
This dog got me all weak and tired.

335
00:35:05.028 --> 00:35:06.028
Ouch!

336
00:35:18.736 --> 00:35:19.736
Yes, Dharma.

337
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.153
Sir.

338
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.986
You promised to find a home for the dog in 4 days.
It's been 2 weeks now.


339
00:35:24.445 --> 00:35:27.546
Please find a solution soon.
I can't bear this torture!


340
00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:32.087
Sure! By the way, give it good food.
The dog looks damn weak.


341
00:35:32.111 --> 00:35:35.361
Only good-looking dogs get adopted.

342
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:36.820
Okay sir.

343
00:36:12.736 --> 00:36:14.570
Look this side!

344
00:36:16.486 --> 00:36:18.629
Look how pretty she looks!

345
00:36:18.653 --> 00:36:21.736
Now watch people queue up to adopt her!

346
00:36:23.195 --> 00:36:24.861
Look!

347
00:36:26.486 --> 00:36:29.945
She is a female dog. Be careful.

348
00:36:30.653 --> 00:36:35.986
In addition to finding her a home,
we'll have to accommodate her pups, too.


349
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:52.712
Yes sir? Did you find her a home?

350
00:36:52.736 --> 00:36:54.945
Of course! When I'm here, why fear!

351
00:36:55.195 --> 00:36:59.754
At 4 pm today,
the interested party will meet you.


352
00:36:59.778 --> 00:37:00.796
Okay sir.

353
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.820
Whatsapp your address.

354
00:37:03.028 --> 00:37:04.361
I will text you.

355
00:37:07.986 --> 00:37:08.962
What is this Uttam?

356
00:37:08.986 --> 00:37:10.528
How can you leave so early?

357
00:37:11.445 --> 00:37:14.546
Learn from Dharma.
He has never asked for leave.


358
00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.587
Nor has he asked to go home early.

359
00:37:16.611 --> 00:37:17.754
Murali sir,

360
00:37:17.778 --> 00:37:19.820
I'm going home early today. Bye.

361
00:38:22.653 --> 00:38:24.171
- Mummy!
- Ma'am, it's not the dog's fault.


362
00:38:24.195 --> 00:38:25.171
It is a trained dog.

363
00:38:25.195 --> 00:38:27.587
- Hey boy, don't you want the dog?
- I do!


364
00:38:27.611 --> 00:38:29.296
Why do you need the dog
when we have your dad at home?


365
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.736
Poor boy wants the dog...

366
00:38:30.861 --> 00:38:32.712
- Ma'am please.
- I want the dog!


367
00:38:32.736 --> 00:38:34.361
Get inside the car.

368
00:38:34.653 --> 00:38:37.736
Ma'am, it's not the dog's fault.
It is well trained.


369
00:38:38.986 --> 00:38:39.986
Ma'am please!

370
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:42.796
Looks like he has guests.

371
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.046
How does that matter?
He'll get a fitting lesson.


372
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.379
How dare he!

373
00:38:47.403 --> 00:38:50.212
Even if he shouts,
we're not scared of him.


374
00:38:50.236 --> 00:38:54.421
[I DIDN'T WANT TO GET INTO A FIGHT
TO MAINTAIN PEACE IN THE COLONY.]


375
00:38:54.445 --> 00:38:56.587
[BUT TODAY, I'll SHOW HIM MY TRUE COLOURS]

376
00:38:56.611 --> 00:38:57.546
Sure, let's see.

377
00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:58.570
Call him out.

378
00:38:59.111 --> 00:39:00.736
Hello, excuse me!

379
00:39:05.153 --> 00:39:07.879
Don't you know pets aren't allowed here?

380
00:39:07.903 --> 00:39:10.087
You insist on following rules for all else.

381
00:39:10.111 --> 00:39:14.028
It doesn't apply only to us.
It is for your dog and you as well.


382
00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.046
Acting smart with us?

383
00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.129
If the cat shuts its eye and drinks milk,
you think nobody will know it?


384
00:39:20.153 --> 00:39:22.611
How dare you keep a pet?

385
00:39:22.986 --> 00:39:25.820
This is what happens when wayward
people like him live in this colony.


386
00:39:25.986 --> 00:39:29.337
God alone knows what else he's up to?

387
00:39:29.361 --> 00:39:32.212
Look at the
way he's glaring at us!


388
00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:33.861
To hell with his glares!

389
00:39:34.028 --> 00:39:37.361
Kids play here.
Imagine having a dog in the same place!


390
00:39:37.403 --> 00:39:39.403
Why did you even bring it here?

391
00:39:39.861 --> 00:39:41.320
You better get rid of it.

392
00:39:41.403 --> 00:39:44.361
Or else, we'll have to throw you out.

393
00:39:57.861 --> 00:39:59.153
This is my house.

394
00:40:00.153 --> 00:40:01.570
I will live here.

395
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:09.861
This is my dog.

396
00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:12.903
It will live here, too.

397
00:40:14.236 --> 00:40:16.986
Let me see which b#st@%d
has the guts to throw us out.


398
00:40:18.945 --> 00:40:22.337
Damn, I think I forgot
to turn off the gas.

399
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:24.379
- Let's go.
- I didn't get scared at all.


400
00:40:24.403 --> 00:40:26.283
- Let's go.
- Leave me.


401
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:31.254
- Hello. Did you arrive?
- I'm coming.


402
00:40:31.278 --> 00:40:32.337
Hey you.

403
00:40:32.361 --> 00:40:34.195
Me?

404
00:40:35.903 --> 00:40:38.546
If I see you wheeling on this road,

405
00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.504
I'll pluck the parts
out and hand it to you.


406
00:40:40.528 --> 00:40:43.153
Not of the bike, but of your body.

407
00:41:02.445 --> 00:41:05.879
You think I'm jobless?
I'm a dog doctor. Not a dog broker.


408
00:41:05.903 --> 00:41:09.671
I didn't mean that.
But please understand my situation.


409
00:41:09.695 --> 00:41:13.587
Okay, I'll put up a post on Facebook.

410
00:41:13.611 --> 00:41:16.111
Send me the dog's
license number immediately.


411
00:41:16.195 --> 00:41:18.129
License?

412
00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:22.587
I haven't got it done.

413
00:41:22.611 --> 00:41:25.754
You don't have one? 
Then do it right now.

414
00:41:25.778 --> 00:41:28.778
If you have a license,
adoption gets easier.


415
00:41:28.861 --> 00:41:31.129
Okay sir. Where do I get it done?

416
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:57.278
Next.

417
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.403
Come Pammi.

418
00:41:58.736 --> 00:41:59.736
Hi...

419
00:42:00.445 --> 00:42:01.861
- Name?
- Pammi.


420
00:42:02.153 --> 00:42:03.171
What do you feed her?

421
00:42:03.195 --> 00:42:05.879
Pedigree and milk. 
And fruits at night.

422
00:42:05.903 --> 00:42:07.879
Good. Is she trained?

423
00:42:07.903 --> 00:42:10.945
The milk she drinks is fetched by her!

424
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.653
Well groomed.

425
00:42:14.111 --> 00:42:17.087
My sugar plum!

426
00:42:17.111 --> 00:42:19.962
What happened sweety? 
Are you hungry?

427
00:42:19.986 --> 00:42:26.087
Mummy! Come soon. I'm hungry.

428
00:42:26.111 --> 00:42:28.528
What's your problem?

429
00:42:28.903 --> 00:42:31.903
- Not you sweety. Relax.
- Next.


430
00:42:33.903 --> 00:42:34.903
Name?

431
00:42:35.028 --> 00:42:36.028
Dharma.

432
00:42:37.278 --> 00:42:39.945
Not yours. The dog's.

433
00:42:44.403 --> 00:42:46.212
What do you call it?

434
00:42:54.236 --> 00:42:55.236
Sorry?

435
00:42:55.611 --> 00:42:57.611
Its name is...

436
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.962
Really?

437
00:43:00.986 --> 00:43:03.486
That's how I call it. Write it now.

438
00:43:04.653 --> 00:43:05.653
Hmmm.

439
00:43:08.445 --> 00:43:09.921
What do you feed it?

440
00:43:09.945 --> 00:43:10.945
Idli.

441
00:43:12.153 --> 00:43:13.153
What?

442
00:43:14.236 --> 00:43:15.611
Idli.

443
00:43:16.445 --> 00:43:18.296
Only idli?

444
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.445
No, I give it chutney, too.

445
00:43:20.903 --> 00:43:25.403
Look. Dogs have a special diet.
You should stick to that.


446
00:43:25.486 --> 00:43:29.320
And maintain its hygiene, too.

447
00:43:29.695 --> 00:43:33.712
So, take this.
Dog Essential Care Guide.


448
00:43:33.736 --> 00:43:37.004
It mentions how to take care of one's pet.
You need it.


449
00:43:37.028 --> 00:43:40.046
Don't teach me how to
take care of my pet.

450
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.879
Keep that book with you.
Let's get down to business.


451
00:43:42.903 --> 00:43:44.736
Give me the license.

452
00:43:49.278 --> 00:43:50.736
[LICENSE NO: 0777]

453
00:43:59.153 --> 00:44:01.403
Next...

454
00:44:02.153 --> 00:44:03.486
[THROWS THE BOOK IN THE BIN]

455
00:44:45.195 --> 00:44:46.028
Tell me.

456
00:44:46.195 --> 00:44:47.195
Hi.

457
00:44:47.403 --> 00:44:49.070
Hi. Can we come in?

458
00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:50.486
No.

459
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.736
Hello, Mr. Dharma! Excuse me.

460
00:44:56.445 --> 00:44:58.462
My name is Devika.

461
00:44:58.486 --> 00:45:00.236
- Kempraju.
- Pragati.


462
00:45:01.278 --> 00:45:03.903
We are from the Animal Welfare Board.

463
00:45:05.736 --> 00:45:09.296
We've got a complaint that
your dog isn't being looked after well.


464
00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.421
Who filed it?

465
00:45:10.445 --> 00:45:11.736
She did.

466
00:45:13.028 --> 00:45:14.254
Are you joking?

467
00:45:14.278 --> 00:45:16.754
First you complain and
then come to check on me?


468
00:45:16.778 --> 00:45:21.778
We have the authority.
So, can we come in?


469
00:45:31.486 --> 00:45:34.111
Cigarette is harmful for dogs.

470
00:45:35.028 --> 00:45:38.403
The dog doesn't smoke. I do.

471
00:45:38.528 --> 00:45:41.528
Smoking is injurious to health.

472
00:45:41.653 --> 00:45:42.695
Anybody's health.

473
00:45:44.403 --> 00:45:45.403
Come to the point.

474
00:45:52.361 --> 00:45:57.320
Not you. Your dog. Where is it?

475
00:45:59.445 --> 00:46:01.028
Hey dog!

476
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:04.611
Not you. My dog.

477
00:46:09.528 --> 00:46:13.653
So, why is there only
one fish in the aquarium?


478
00:46:13.986 --> 00:46:16.546
There were three. 
Now there's only one.

479
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:20.611
Animal cruelty is a punishable of fence.

480
00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:23.921
The other day we caught an offender.

481
00:46:23.945 --> 00:46:26.087
He was sentenced to 4 years in prison.

482
00:46:26.111 --> 00:46:27.879
4 years.

483
00:46:27.903 --> 00:46:28.754
But don't worry.

484
00:46:28.778 --> 00:46:30.796
I'd like you to be well
informed, that's all.


485
00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.611
What to do?

486
00:46:33.778 --> 00:46:35.236
It's my job.

487
00:46:37.195 --> 00:46:38.778
I have to do it.

488
00:46:56.111 --> 00:47:00.629
Kempraju,
check if the dog is healthy.


489
00:47:00.653 --> 00:47:01.778
Okay ma'am.

490
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:05.903
Hello Chu Chu!

491
00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:17.403
Help! It'll bite me!
It's an extremely healthy dog ma'am!


492
00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:20.570
Please call it sir! 
It'll bite me!

493
00:47:20.695 --> 00:47:23.695
Sir! Please call it!

494
00:47:40.695 --> 00:47:41.695
Oh god!

495
00:47:43.111 --> 00:47:45.629
Your dog is really sharp!

496
00:47:45.653 --> 00:47:50.028
Anyway, the Pedigree is over.
Buy a new one.


497
00:47:50.445 --> 00:47:55.028
You eat the idlis.
Keep the cigarettes away from the dog.


498
00:47:55.153 --> 00:47:58.528
So, we're off. For now.
Bye.


499
00:48:12.778 --> 00:48:13.778
Dharma!

500
00:48:15.486 --> 00:48:17.212
Yes, Dharma! All well?

501
00:48:17.236 --> 00:48:20.504
You have two days.
Find someone by then.


502
00:48:20.528 --> 00:48:22.671
If not, I'll plonk him on your desk.

503
00:48:22.695 --> 00:48:25.986
Oh come on! This job
is snap of a finger for me!


504
00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.153
What! He cut the call?

505
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:33.587
Don't say you want more time!
I can't wait any longer.


506
00:48:33.611 --> 00:48:35.671
Don't create a fuss everyday.
You both go inside.


507
00:48:35.695 --> 00:48:37.337
I need my money back!

508
00:48:37.361 --> 00:48:38.421
I'm saying I have no money.

509
00:48:38.445 --> 00:48:39.337
What are you saying?

510
00:48:39.361 --> 00:48:41.921
I didn't borrow it for gambling, okay?

511
00:48:41.945 --> 00:48:44.129
I'll give it when I get the promotion.

512
00:48:44.153 --> 00:48:47.254
- I can't wait that long.
- Then I can't give it to you.


513
00:48:47.278 --> 00:48:50.171
- If you don't, I won't budge from here.
- Do as you please.


514
00:48:50.195 --> 00:48:51.236
Hey dog!

515
00:48:54.653 --> 00:48:56.111
Come here!

516
00:48:57.361 --> 00:48:58.445
What are you staring at?

517
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.129
Will you come or
should I bash you up?

518
00:49:02.153 --> 00:49:04.712
No, I'll leave.

519
00:49:04.736 --> 00:49:07.754
So you've hired people to bash me up, huh?
I'll fetch the police.


520
00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:10.070
I am not a coward.

521
00:50:07.653 --> 00:50:09.570
Is there no one from the patient's family?

522
00:50:09.611 --> 00:50:11.403
Coming right behind us.

523
00:50:52.236 --> 00:50:53.736
Hey.. Hey..

524
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.820
Hey dog!

525
00:51:02.736 --> 00:51:04.278
Somebody catch it...

526
00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:08.028
ECG is normal.
It's just a panic attack that you had.


527
00:51:08.403 --> 00:51:10.320
Do you have anxiety issues?

528
00:51:10.986 --> 00:51:13.528
Okay. Do you smoke?

529
00:51:15.695 --> 00:51:17.629
Who the hell let that dog in?

530
00:51:17.653 --> 00:51:20.778
Sir, it came running behind the ambulance.

531
00:51:39.945 --> 00:51:43.004
[CHARLIE CHAPLIN: I'M SORRY, I DON'T WANT
TO BE AN EMPEROR.]


532
00:51:43.028 --> 00:51:45.379
[THAT IS NOT MY BUSINESS.]

533
00:51:45.403 --> 00:51:48.171
[I DON'T WANT TO RULE OR CONQUER ANYONE.]

534
00:51:48.195 --> 00:51:51.195
[I SHALL LIKE TO HELP
EVERYONE IF POSSIBLE.]


535
00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.820
[WE THINK TOO MUCH AND FEEL TOO LITTLE.]

536
00:51:55.111 --> 00:51:57.736
[MORE THAN MACHINERY, 
WE NEED HUMANITY.]

537
00:51:57.778 --> 00:52:01.962
[MORE THAN CLEVERNESS,

538

LIFE WILL BE VIOLENT.]


539
00:52:05.111 --> 00:52:07.278
[AND ALL WILL BE LOST.]

540
00:53:06.403 --> 00:53:08.153
Thank god you're at home!

541
00:53:08.736 --> 00:53:12.070
Why can't you answer the phone?
I tried calling you so many times!


542
00:53:15.695 --> 00:53:17.129
What are all these?

543
00:53:17.153 --> 00:53:18.861
Feels like I've come to a bar.

544
00:53:19.403 --> 00:53:20.986
What brings you here, sir?

545
00:53:21.695 --> 00:53:22.962
What do you mean?

546
00:53:22.986 --> 00:53:25.129
Didn't you call and
blast me the other day?

547
00:53:25.153 --> 00:53:29.028
That's why I've decided to
reduce your tension today.


548
00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:33.986
Come, come kids.

549
00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.320
Come.

550
00:53:36.945 --> 00:53:38.796
Who are these people, sir?

551
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.403
They're here to adopt the dog. What else?

552
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:45.986
Ma'am come. Sir, you too!
Please come in.


553
00:53:46.611 --> 00:53:47.611
Come in.

554
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.986
That's the dog!

555
00:53:51.778 --> 00:53:53.658
I want to kill this guy!

556
00:53:53.945 --> 00:53:56.796
Ma'am, here. Take it for a trial.

557
00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.046
- Give it to me.
- This way ma'am.


558
00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:00.379
- I want to go first.
- No, I want to!


559
00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:02.653
Careful kids.
Be gentle with the dog.


560
00:54:03.986 --> 00:54:06.986
- Come here.
- Hey cutie. Come, come!


561
00:54:07.653 --> 00:54:08.945
Don't be scared, come.

562
00:54:08.986 --> 00:54:10.486
Come.

563
00:54:10.653 --> 00:54:12.296
It looks so cute!

564
00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.361
Yes.

565
00:54:13.486 --> 00:54:15.903
Uncle, have you named it?

566
00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:19.736
No, it's a new dog.
Name it once you take it home.


567
00:54:19.945 --> 00:54:20.462
Hmmm.

568
00:54:20.486 --> 00:54:23.254
Mom, I want a black dog.

569
00:54:23.278 --> 00:54:25.379
Don't kid. It's easier to spot the dirt
in a black dog.


570
00:54:25.403 --> 00:54:26.421
But I want one...

571
00:54:26.445 --> 00:54:27.153
That's true.

572
00:54:27.403 --> 00:54:29.486
Has the dog been potty trained?

573
00:54:30.195 --> 00:54:33.903
Of course!
It even flushes after doing its job!


574
00:54:39.486 --> 00:54:42.486
Hello... hi...!

575
00:54:44.653 --> 00:54:46.903
Sir, I need to
have a word with you.

576
00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.445
What's the matter?

577
00:54:48.528 --> 00:54:51.629
He's just concerned because
he's been with the dog so long.


578
00:54:51.653 --> 00:54:53.712
Obviously, he'll miss it.

579
00:54:53.736 --> 00:54:57.361
Don't worry. I think the kids
are already in love with the dog.


580
00:54:57.736 --> 00:54:59.611
Happy? I'll leave now.

581
00:54:59.695 --> 00:55:02.546
He will transfer the
license documents to you.


582
00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:03.153
Okay.

583
00:55:03.403 --> 00:55:04.653
Let's go ma'am.

584
00:56:27.528 --> 00:56:28.528
Drink little one...

585
00:56:30.445 --> 00:56:32.445
Take son...

586
00:56:33.195 --> 00:56:36.820
What happened son? 
You seem to be upset.

587
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:45.570
What nonsense is this! Brainless...

588
00:56:54.153 --> 00:56:57.195
Don't keep barking...

589
00:56:58.361 --> 00:57:01.611
Go eat your idli.

590
00:57:26.195 --> 00:57:27.361
Doggy?

591
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.236
Is it sleeping?

592
00:57:32.903 --> 00:57:38.195
Once it wakes up, please show this picture
and say Adrika made it.


593
00:57:42.361 --> 00:57:44.945
Uncle, why don't you ever smile?

594
00:57:45.861 --> 00:57:46.861
Adrika!

595
00:57:47.278 --> 00:57:50.028
Okay uncle, see you tomorrow. Bye.

596
00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:07.070
How long does it
take for you to transfer the license?


597
00:58:07.986 --> 00:58:08.671
I'll get it done, sir.

598
00:58:08.695 --> 00:58:11.546
No use of that now.
They've got the forms home already.


599
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:14.129
Take the documents and sign it for them.
Don't ruin my reputation.


600
00:58:14.153 --> 00:58:19.611
That lady is repeatedly calling me saying
that the dog doesn't flush after its potty.


601
00:58:20.195 --> 00:58:23.611
I'll send the address. Please go.

602
00:58:53.028 --> 00:58:55.236
Come out! Now!

603
00:59:44.903 --> 00:59:48.296
Mom, I want a black dog.

604
00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.278
Shut up now!

605
00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:54.087
The wind whispers something.

606
00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:58.879
The world seems lively now!

607
00:59:58.903 --> 01:00:03.212
There's a spring in the step,

608
01:00:03.236 --> 01:00:06.903
in this new course of life.

609
01:00:10.111 --> 01:00:14.587
Be with me, don't go anywhere.

610
01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:18.778
Be around me... joyous as always.

611
01:00:19.736 --> 01:00:21.212
In the path of life,

612
01:00:21.236 --> 01:00:24.462
I have found a new turning point.

613
01:00:24.486 --> 01:00:28.570
Join me in this
journey and hug me tight.

614
01:00:33.653 --> 01:00:35.611
Got a new dog son?

615
01:00:36.361 --> 01:00:39.653
Adorable!
What have you named it?


616
01:00:40.986 --> 01:00:45.754
Our path crosses again.

617
01:00:45.778 --> 01:00:49.754
Like we were meant to be.

618
01:00:49.778 --> 01:00:52.754
Now on, my routine shall be new.

619
01:00:52.778 --> 01:00:54.153
Charlie!

620
01:00:54.361 --> 01:00:59.504
I'll say without a doubt
that you're my best friend.


621
01:00:59.528 --> 01:01:02.671
Charlie!

622
01:01:02.695 --> 01:01:08.837
I'm reborn now and
you're the reason for it.


623
01:01:08.861 --> 01:01:11.754
Charlie!

624
01:01:11.778 --> 01:01:14.421
You're the sole focus of my life.

625
01:01:14.445 --> 01:01:17.445
Charlie... Charlie!

626
01:01:18.111 --> 01:01:19.903
Uncle, what are you up to?

627
01:01:20.403 --> 01:01:22.486
- Surprise.
- Adi, don't be late.


628
01:01:22.986 --> 01:01:25.111
Yes mom, I'm coming.

629
01:01:28.195 --> 01:01:29.195
Oh Charlie!

630
01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:56.070
In this journey,
you motivate me to proceed further.


631
01:01:57.861 --> 01:02:00.046
I will never forget the
blows you've received.


632
01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:01.212
Good morning Uttam.

633
01:02:01.236 --> 01:02:02.462
- Good morning sir.
- Sit down.


634
01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:07.236
I've collected every memory,
and preserved it in my pocket.


635
01:02:07.653 --> 01:02:09.671
Dharma sir has changed so much!

636
01:02:09.695 --> 01:02:12.171
Yet, there's so much to say.

637
01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:16.046
Our emotions speak more than words.

638
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:17.736
Oh Charlie!

639
01:02:35.361 --> 01:02:40.087
Oh Charlie, ask me a thousand times,

640
01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:42.212
And I will say without a doubt,

641
01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:45.421
you're my best friend forever.

642
01:02:45.445 --> 01:02:48.421
Charlie!

643
01:02:48.445 --> 01:02:50.171
I'm reborn now.

644
01:02:50.195 --> 01:02:54.796
And you're the reason for it.

645
01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.671
Charlie!

646
01:02:57.695 --> 01:03:00.337
You're the sole focus of my life.

647
01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:02.736
Charlie...

648
01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:19.820
Hey.

649
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:22.712
Jumping in front of the TV
won't fetch you ice cream.


650
01:03:22.736 --> 01:03:24.111
It's in the fridge, take it.

651
01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.379
Now on, my routine shall be new.

652
01:03:35.403 --> 01:03:39.212
I'll say without a doubt,
that you're my best friend.


653
01:03:39.236 --> 01:03:40.236
Take.

654
01:03:41.653 --> 01:03:42.671
I have quit smoking.

655
01:03:42.695 --> 01:03:43.695
Huh?

656
01:03:45.861 --> 01:03:47.587
I'm reborn now.

657
01:03:47.611 --> 01:03:52.212
And you're the reason for it.

658
01:03:52.236 --> 01:03:54.171
Charlie.

659
01:03:54.195 --> 01:03:55.337
Ready?

660
01:03:55.361 --> 01:03:56.879
You're the sole focus of my life.

661
01:03:56.903 --> 01:03:58.546
Smile.

662
01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:00.111
Charlie!

663
01:04:03.195 --> 01:04:05.236
Sit! Charlie sit.

664
01:04:05.653 --> 01:04:09.986
Sit, or else I won't give you this.

665
01:04:12.195 --> 01:04:17.736
Charlie, please repeat the 'thanks'
what you showed me a while ago.


666
01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:25.945
Uncle, I taught Charlie
the 'thanks' gesture.


667
01:04:26.486 --> 01:04:27.546
Really?

668
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:29.629
Charlie, come here.

669
01:04:29.653 --> 01:04:32.320
Uncle come. Quick.

670
01:04:32.361 --> 01:04:33.695
Okay.

671
01:04:35.486 --> 01:04:37.861
Charlie, show him...

672
01:04:39.611 --> 01:04:41.986
Charlie do the 'thanks' gesture.

673
01:04:43.361 --> 01:04:45.296
She did it a while ago uncle.

674
01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:52.070
Charlie, please fold your hands and
show him what you did a while ago.


675
01:04:54.195 --> 01:05:00.653
I promise she did it, uncle.
Please do it Charlie...


676
01:05:01.611 --> 01:05:05.403
Adi, looks like Charlie is tired.
She'll do it later.


677
01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:09.111
No uncle. She did it some time ago.

678
01:05:09.903 --> 01:05:13.695
Please Charlie... show him.

679
01:05:14.445 --> 01:05:17.671
If Charlie doesn't gesture 'thanks',
let's not give her the ice-cream.


680
01:05:17.695 --> 01:05:20.153
Okay forget it! I'm leaving.

681
01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:35.546
All you do is eat and sleep.
Can you do anything else?


682
01:05:35.570 --> 01:05:37.111
Poor kid. She was in tears.

683
01:05:37.153 --> 01:05:39.028
Take the helmet and ride by yourself.

684
01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.004
Okay. Show Adrika what you've learnt
when she comes tomorrow.


685
01:06:05.028 --> 01:06:06.570
Understood?

686
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:10.236
I'll be back home soon today.

687
01:06:10.611 --> 01:06:12.486
I have a surprise for you this evening.

688
01:06:16.778 --> 01:06:20.611
What's this new trick now? Move it!

689
01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:29.070
Oh yeah! Charlie fetch!

690
01:06:31.361 --> 01:06:34.570
Okay then...

691
01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:43.736
I'll take you for a ride in the evening.
Okay? Bye.


692
01:06:46.986 --> 01:06:49.796
You keep asking me to come to various places.
You take me for a cab?


693
01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:52.945
- I'll thrash you!
- Please...


694
01:06:57.236 --> 01:07:00.236
Dharma, here's the
promotion list of your department.


695
01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.879
Let me know who is eligible.

696
01:07:01.903 --> 01:07:03.111
Okay sir.

697
01:07:08.153 --> 01:07:10.278
I'll ask them to load it.

698
01:07:11.445 --> 01:07:12.445
Sir.

699
01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:13.736
Done? Okay.

700
01:07:17.445 --> 01:07:19.695
Nothing is permanent in this wicked world.

701
01:07:20.111 --> 01:07:21.421
Not even our troubles.

702
01:07:21.445 --> 01:07:23.754
So Kruparkar has finally
got his promotion! Congratulations!


703
01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:25.945
Charlie Chaplin is right.

704
01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.004
I had a limited view of life.

705
01:07:28.028 --> 01:07:31.111
But Charlie came along and
changed it.


706
01:07:34.153 --> 01:07:36.820
What happened? Still angry?

707
01:07:40.403 --> 01:07:42.278
The house is full of paw prints.

708
01:07:42.778 --> 01:07:44.820
Go to Adrika's house for a few days.

709
01:07:45.111 --> 01:07:47.736
I'll begin painting the
house from tomorrow.


710
01:07:48.778 --> 01:07:52.236
Hey! Why haven't you eaten anything?

711
01:07:55.153 --> 01:07:56.153
Oh yeah?

712
01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:00.361
Now?

713
01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:05.195
Charlie.

714
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:34.820
Sorry doctor. I left the ball with Charlie.

715
01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:38.611
I'll ensure it doesn't happen again.

716
01:08:38.903 --> 01:08:42.861
Dharma, this isn't because
she swallowed the ball.


717
01:08:43.111 --> 01:08:45.153
Okay. Then?

718
01:08:45.403 --> 01:08:47.695
She has Hemangiosarcoma.

719
01:08:49.695 --> 01:08:53.153
I hope there's no problem.
Please give her some medication.


720
01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:57.486
I will. But it won't suffice.

721
01:08:58.195 --> 01:09:00.736
Do you have to operate on her?

722
01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:03.361
Dharma, she has cancer.

723
01:09:04.945 --> 01:09:08.903
She has clots in her veins.

724
01:09:10.945 --> 01:09:16.945
I suspected this when I saw her.
Blood test, CT scan is all done.


725
01:09:18.361 --> 01:09:20.570
It's confirmed she has cancer.

726
01:09:22.153 --> 01:09:26.421
But I've looked after her well, doctor.
How can she get cancer?


727
01:09:26.445 --> 01:09:29.129
Like you suggested,
she's even got all her vaccinations.


728
01:09:29.153 --> 01:09:33.486
You've looked after her well.
But that's not it.


729
01:09:34.361 --> 01:09:37.736
I feel this is genetic mutation.

730
01:09:38.236 --> 01:09:42.403
Some breeders mate
siblings and this happens.


731
01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:46.754
This is called inbreeding.

732
01:09:46.778 --> 01:09:50.403
Some breeders will do anything for money.

733
01:09:50.861 --> 01:09:53.962
I found her on the road, doctor.
I didn't buy her from a breeder.


734
01:09:53.986 --> 01:09:58.570
I agree. But you found a lost dog.

735
01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:02.653
How else will you find
a labrador on the street?


736
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:09.070
I'll prescribe some medicines.
Take care of her.


737
01:10:11.778 --> 01:10:14.087
I know you're hurt.

738
01:10:14.111 --> 01:10:17.778
But she's in pain, too. 
Remember that.

739
01:10:18.945 --> 01:10:21.945
Dharma!

740
01:10:28.361 --> 01:10:30.046
How much time does she have doctor?

741
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:35.212
Can't say Dharma.
She's in her final stage.


742
01:10:35.236 --> 01:10:37.337
You can get chemotherapy done.

743
01:10:37.361 --> 01:10:45.195
But you'd rather have her living a short
and sweet life than a long and painful one.


744
01:11:07.278 --> 01:11:09.028
Happiness heals pain, they say.

745
01:11:11.695 --> 01:11:15.820
Charlie has been my healing happiness.

746
01:11:19.903 --> 01:11:24.070
But where do I seek the
happiness that will heal her pain?


747
01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.921
SNOW!

748
01:12:06.015 --> 01:12:10.140
I kept thinking that it was
the ice-cream that excited her.


749
01:12:11.181 --> 01:12:12.181
Snow...

750
01:12:25.056 --> 01:12:30.324
How do I bid farewell to you?

751
01:12:30.348 --> 01:12:35.657
You're the apple of my eye.

752
01:12:35.681 --> 01:12:40.657
You, who came to teach
me the meaning of love,


753
01:12:40.681 --> 01:12:45.241
have become a piece of my own heart.

754
01:12:45.265 --> 01:12:53.265
You have written the
foreword to a new journey.


755
01:12:55.431 --> 01:12:56.657
Let's go Charlie.

756
01:12:56.681 --> 01:13:01.199
Having lit up my life,

757
01:13:01.223 --> 01:13:06.366
you've chosen to embrace the dark.

758
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:14.390
My past and my
future is you my friend.

759
01:13:52.306 --> 01:14:00.306
You are like a flower
entangled in a whirlpool.


760
01:14:00.598 --> 01:14:03.116
How do I tolerate this pain?

761
01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:11.032
Stuck in the clutches of time,

762
01:14:11.056 --> 01:14:13.991
and endless pain.

763
01:14:14.015 --> 01:14:17.449
Uncle, when will you both return?

764
01:14:17.473 --> 01:14:19.032
As soon as possible.

765
01:14:19.056 --> 01:14:24.241
Okay, come soon. 
I'll miss you guys.

766
01:14:24.265 --> 01:14:29.056
Don't let Charlie play in the water.
She'll catch a cold.


767
01:14:35.265 --> 01:14:39.741
Please bring Charlie back in time
for my fancy dress competition.


768
01:14:39.765 --> 01:14:42.390
I'm going dressed as Charlie Chaplin.

769
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.640
Don't tell Charlie, it's a surprise.

770
01:14:51.223 --> 01:14:52.640
Uncle...

771
01:14:56.473 --> 01:15:00.890
She did the 'thanks' gesture the other day.

772
01:15:20.098 --> 01:15:21.241
It's all right now.

773
01:15:21.265 --> 01:15:23.699
No, it's not. Give it to me.

774
01:15:23.723 --> 01:15:29.223
No way! What do you know?
I'm the one using it. I know...


775
01:15:29.765 --> 01:15:31.223
It's nice.

776
01:15:31.806 --> 01:15:34.973
Please keep your foot firmly.

777
01:15:35.181 --> 01:15:36.421
Yes, I have -

778
01:15:37.806 --> 01:15:41.015
Ah! Son!
When did you come?


779
01:15:42.431 --> 01:15:46.491
New one. Got it from the city. Nice?

780
01:15:46.515 --> 01:15:54.515
Conversations in silence convey
emotions far more powerful than words.


781
01:15:55.140 --> 01:16:03.116
The bond that binds us as one,
goes beyond this lifetime.


782
01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:08.324
A life that's writhing in pain.

783
01:16:08.348 --> 01:16:13.741
How are you even handling this suffering?

784
01:16:13.765 --> 01:16:18.949
The silent tears you shed,

785
01:16:18.973 --> 01:16:24.199
have dried up without a trace.

786
01:16:24.223 --> 01:16:29.657
You complete all my
yesterdays and tomorrows.


787
01:16:29.681 --> 01:16:34.056
Oh god!

788
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:44.390
Come Charlie.

789
01:16:52.098 --> 01:16:52.741
Dharma...

790
01:16:52.765 --> 01:16:53.449
Sir...

791
01:16:53.473 --> 01:16:57.098
The first time you brought Charlie to me,
she was petrified of the injection. Remember?


792
01:16:57.348 --> 01:16:58.348
Yes...

793
01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:01.723

01:18:09.973 --> 01:18:14.699
I've got his address.
I will file a complaint with the police.


806
01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:20.015
If you can, go say 'hi' to him.
Say it with a punch, okay?


807
01:19:10.848 --> 01:19:11.931
Who are you?

808
01:19:24.223 --> 01:19:25.223
What do you want?

809
01:19:26.265 --> 01:19:27.265
Do you have a spade?

810
01:19:27.515 --> 01:19:28.515
What?

811
01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:30.473
A pick axe?

812
01:19:34.265 --> 01:19:37.015
I will do the talking. 
You keep quiet.

813
01:19:39.348 --> 01:19:40.515
Do you remember her?

814
01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:48.015
Keaton.

815
01:19:51.598 --> 01:19:52.598
Syringe.

816
01:19:54.598 --> 01:19:55.681
Cigarette.

817
01:20:01.598 --> 01:20:04.140
Sir, my job here is done.

818
01:20:04.723 --> 01:20:07.681
He's safe here.
Go ahead and file the complaint.


819
01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:12.556
Charlie!

820
01:20:20.890 --> 01:20:22.265
Every dog has its day.

821
01:20:23.598 --> 01:20:24.598
Today is Charlie's.

822
01:20:33.265 --> 01:20:35.056
Didn't he mention where he's off to?

823
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:38.640
He doesn't bother
telling us all that. Moron!


824
01:20:38.848 --> 01:20:40.282
Did he look after the dog well?

825
01:20:40.306 --> 01:20:43.598
Would a man who tortures humans,
treat his dog well?


826
01:20:43.806 --> 01:20:45.699
I pity that dog.
Wonder how it lived with him...


827
01:20:45.723 --> 01:20:47.074
I always had my doubts about him.

828
01:20:47.098 --> 01:20:50.306
Yes! He always tortured it.

829
01:20:50.931 --> 01:20:54.157
You're showing so much
concern about the dog.


830
01:20:54.181 --> 01:20:56.473
But there's a 'pets not
allowed' board outside.


831
01:20:57.015 --> 01:20:59.390
Yes. But not anymore.

832
01:21:00.181 --> 01:21:02.699
The rules have changed. 
I got it done.

833
01:21:02.723 --> 01:21:04.431
We need pet lovers like you.

834
01:21:04.723 --> 01:21:06.390
We have many rescue dogs.

835
01:21:06.723 --> 01:21:08.949
You must adopt one.
Give me your number.


836
01:21:08.973 --> 01:21:12.056
Sure! Next time.
I have to get my bike serviced.


837
01:21:13.765 --> 01:21:16.140
Don't bother with that moron ma'am!

838
01:21:21.723 --> 01:21:22.848
Vijayapura.

839
01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:28.098
Hello ma'am. I've stepped out for a bit.

840
01:21:30.098 --> 01:21:33.640
Is that so? Share the location.
I'll go right away.


841
01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:35.431
Okay.

842
01:21:40.765 --> 01:21:42.098
Same location!

843
01:21:49.765 --> 01:21:50.765
Hey let me go!

844
01:21:52.348 --> 01:21:53.556
Don't mess with me!

845
01:21:53.973 --> 01:21:55.181
You will pay for it!

846
01:21:55.848 --> 01:21:57.568
Has it been given first aid, sir?

847
01:21:58.723 --> 01:21:59.324
Let me go!

848
01:21:59.348 --> 01:22:01.556
Ma'am is here.
Hi ma'am.


849
01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.848
How many dogs are here?

850
01:22:04.015 --> 01:22:05.181
115 ma'am.

851
01:22:05.473 --> 01:22:06.473
And puppies?

852
01:22:07.015 --> 01:22:07.699
77.

853
01:22:07.723 --> 01:22:08.574
Have you got their pictures?

854
01:22:08.598 --> 01:22:09.598
Yes.

855
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:16.616
Pictures?

856
01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:17.640
I have them here.

857
01:22:19.431 --> 01:22:21.015
Where is he off to?

858
01:22:25.806 --> 01:22:27.366
Another criminal
has fled from the scene.


859
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:28.473
I will follow him.

860
01:22:28.765 --> 01:22:30.657
I will share
the location, come there.


861
01:22:30.681 --> 01:22:31.681
Okay ma'am.

862
01:22:55.556 --> 01:22:57.657
As we journey on my bike,

863
01:22:57.681 --> 01:22:59.491
with you my beloved companion.

864
01:22:59.515 --> 01:23:01.824
In the intoxicating breeze,

865
01:23:01.848 --> 01:23:04.241
let's spread our wings and fly.

866
01:23:04.265 --> 01:23:08.532
Does a road without hurdles ever exist?

867
01:23:08.556 --> 01:23:10.657
With you as my beloved companion,

868
01:23:10.681 --> 01:23:13.265
let's spread our wings and fly.

869
01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.907
Why didn't you tell me earlier
that the battery is empty?


870
01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:22.407
[KEMPRAJU: I THOUGHT YOU'LL FIGURE WHEN
IT RUNS OUT OF CHARGE.]


871
01:23:22.431 --> 01:23:25.324
My foot! I've shared the location with you
Go to hell!


872
01:23:25.348 --> 01:23:26.348
[KEMPRAJU: OKAY MA'AM.]

873
01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:51.140
Hi.

874
01:23:51.931 --> 01:23:53.074
Do you have rooms?

875
01:23:53.098 --> 01:23:54.765
Yes. Single or double?

876
01:23:57.723 --> 01:23:59.491
We do sir, but...

877
01:23:59.515 --> 01:24:01.282
Pets not allowed sir.

878
01:24:01.306 --> 01:24:04.199
But if the dog barks,
it will disturb our guests.


879
01:24:04.223 --> 01:24:08.532
Don't worry. She never barks.

880
01:24:17.515 --> 01:24:20.355
[YOU CAN KEEP YOUR TRUST IN US.
AND WE SHALL KEEP YOU ON THE RIGHT PATH]


881
01:24:37.223 --> 01:24:38.583
Excuse me sir?

882
01:24:40.598 --> 01:24:41.598
Sir.

883
01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.223
Sorry sir, pets not allowed.

884
01:24:44.765 --> 01:24:48.407
She's like a pair of eyes for me.
I can't budge without her.


885
01:24:48.431 --> 01:24:50.515
Sorry sir. Hotel rules.

886
01:24:50.973 --> 01:24:58.265
Sir, just imagine. A blind man. In this dark hour.
Where will he even go?


887
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:02.515
No mom. The office must
have booked a nice room...


888
01:25:11.056 --> 01:25:12.140
Hotel Narayana!

889
01:25:13.015 --> 01:25:14.824
As we journey on my bike,

890
01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:17.199
with you as my beloved companion.

891
01:25:17.223 --> 01:25:19.282
In the intoxicating breeze,

892
01:25:19.306 --> 01:25:21.723
let's spread our wings and fly.

893
01:25:31.973 --> 01:25:33.907
In search of my soul,

894
01:25:33.931 --> 01:25:36.032
the path I've taken has been filled

895
01:25:36.056 --> 01:25:40.449
by silence and loneliness.

896
01:25:40.473 --> 01:25:42.824
Tired of being caged,

897
01:25:42.848 --> 01:25:46.366
my spirit craves the
freedom of a flowing river.


898
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:48.574
Excuse me. Did someone by the name
Dharma check in here last night?


899
01:25:48.598 --> 01:25:51.848
Yes ma'am. The blind man.
He had come with his dog.


900
01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:53.157
Blind?

901
01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:54.181
Yes.

902
01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:57.991
Yes, blind.
Can you charge my mobile please?


903
01:25:58.015 --> 01:26:00.098
Stay here. I'll be back.

904
01:26:01.098 --> 01:26:03.324
For every small ripple of joy,

905
01:26:03.348 --> 01:26:05.515
The heart rejoices like a child.

906
01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.056
Hey Charlie!

907
01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:27.640
Charlie! Stop!

908
01:26:29.056 --> 01:26:30.056
Charlie!

909
01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.140
Charlie...

910
01:26:38.015 --> 01:26:39.223
Don't run. Wait!

911
01:26:39.973 --> 01:26:40.973
Charlie!

912
01:26:44.556 --> 01:26:45.556
Charlie!

913
01:26:51.598 --> 01:26:52.598
Charlie!

914
01:27:04.181 --> 01:27:05.181
Charlie!

915
01:27:06.181 --> 01:27:07.181
Stay right there.

916
01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:09.990
Charlie, stay.

917
01:27:11.323 --> 01:27:12.323
Charlie...

918
01:27:31.656 --> 01:27:33.198
I had never been to a police station.

919
01:27:34.948 --> 01:27:36.228
You gave me that privilege, too.

920
01:27:38.615 --> 01:27:42.656
Poor dog, sir. She's done it unknowingly
and you put her behind bars?


921
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:46.990
An owner should be responbile for his dog.

922
01:27:47.906 --> 01:27:49.573
Ask him to give 10,000 bucks.

923
01:27:49.948 --> 01:27:50.948
Okay sir.

924
01:27:52.281 --> 01:27:54.401
If you don't have cash,
then rot in there.


925
01:27:54.448 --> 01:27:55.674
Okay, here take a look.

926
01:27:56.323 --> 01:27:58.507
I have only two thousand bucks.
I have to reach Himachal with this amount.


927
01:27:58.531 --> 01:28:01.091
Himachal?
This won't suffice even for the fuel.


928
01:28:01.115 --> 01:28:02.115
This is all I have.

929
01:28:02.615 --> 01:28:04.615
This amount won't do for us.

930
01:28:04.906 --> 01:28:05.632
Please understand, sir...

931
01:28:05.656 --> 01:28:07.281
Sir, I want to file a complaint.

932
01:28:11.573 --> 01:28:12.573
Tell me.

933
01:28:13.823 --> 01:28:14.799
That dog is mine.

934
01:28:14.823 --> 01:28:15.823
What?

935
01:28:17.281 --> 01:28:20.281
The dog in the lock up is mine.
He's stolen it from me.


936
01:28:20.698 --> 01:28:21.698
Oh!

937
01:28:22.156 --> 01:28:24.365
Sir, he has only two thousand bucks.

938
01:28:24.656 --> 01:28:32.365
It's okay. The dog's owner is here.
She will pay the rest of it. Isn't it dear?


939
01:28:33.823 --> 01:28:34.424
Me?

940
01:28:34.448 --> 01:28:35.216
Yes.

941
01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:36.240
Why sir?

942
01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:42.990
Your dog has broken the
windshield of our jeep. That's why.


943
01:28:43.531 --> 01:28:45.924
Hey, let him go.

944
01:28:45.948 --> 01:28:46.924
Okay sir.

945
01:28:46.948 --> 01:28:51.031
Sir, I'll give you the two thousand bucks.
But please don't release him.


946
01:28:53.073 --> 01:28:57.781
Do you take this for a lodge to take
money and keep him inside?


947
01:28:58.990 --> 01:29:02.174
Take his signature and release him.

948
01:29:02.198 --> 01:29:03.198
Okay sir.

949
01:29:06.073 --> 01:29:09.781
Pay up the money and take the dog.

950
01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:13.466
Sir, you can't let him go.

951
01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:16.007
I am an Animal Welfare Officer.
I have proof. This fellow...


952
01:29:16.031 --> 01:29:18.323
Ma'am, here's your dog.

953
01:29:18.948 --> 01:29:21.198
Sir, this fellow is torturing the dog.

954
01:29:21.490 --> 01:29:25.216
He's also partnered with a criminal
and is running an illegal breeding centre.


955
01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:31.299
According to IPC 428 and 429, it's an of fence
to kill or hurt any animal including a stray dog.


956
01:29:31.323 --> 01:29:35.781
This fellow and his boss have
been torturing so many animals.


957
01:29:36.156 --> 01:29:40.132
It has all been captured on CCTV.
I will submit evidence.


958
01:29:40.156 --> 01:29:42.257
You can't let him go
in exchange for money.


959
01:29:42.281 --> 01:29:44.591
Don't release him until my team comes.

960
01:29:44.615 --> 01:29:47.740
If you do that, I'll have to
take strict action against you.


961
01:29:54.865 --> 01:29:57.240
Pay up and take your damn dog away!

962
01:30:07.906 --> 01:30:08.948
What are you feeding her?

963
01:30:17.906 --> 01:30:18.906
Get down.

964
01:30:18.948 --> 01:30:20.628
Until my team comes, 
I will stay with her.

965
01:30:20.823 --> 01:30:21.882
Get down right away.

966
01:30:21.906 --> 01:30:23.882
You think I don't know
the sort of person you are?


967
01:30:23.906 --> 01:30:25.716
I know where you're taking her...

968
01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:28.049
[POLICE: BOTH OF YOU LEAVE
OR I'll PUT YOU IN THE LOCK UP]


969
01:30:28.073 --> 01:30:30.757
My lover is in my heart.

970
01:30:30.781 --> 01:30:33.466
Lord Ram is in my heart.

971
01:30:33.490 --> 01:30:36.091
My lover is in my heart.

972
01:30:36.115 --> 01:30:38.299
Lord Ram is in my heart.

973
01:30:38.323 --> 01:30:41.049
Oh where, oh where.

974
01:30:41.073 --> 01:30:43.716
Oh where, oh where.

975
01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:46.757
Where should I go to find you?

976
01:30:46.781 --> 01:30:50.466
My lover is still in my heart..

977
01:30:50.490 --> 01:30:52.865
My lover is still in my heart..

978
01:31:03.573 --> 01:31:06.007
I've seen Lord Brahma, seen Lord Vishnu.

979
01:31:06.031 --> 01:31:08.799
Don't bark! I'm here to save you.

980
01:31:08.823 --> 01:31:11.174
I have seen Goddess Saraswati

981
01:31:11.198 --> 01:31:13.882
I have seen Goddess Saraswati.

982
01:31:13.906 --> 01:31:15.948
My lover is in my heart.

983
01:31:23.865 --> 01:31:24.865
Charlie...

984
01:31:28.865 --> 01:31:30.549
I've been working for four years.

985
01:31:30.573 --> 01:31:34.240
Just because you change her name,
you think I won't get to know?


986
01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:37.115
On top of it, that blind
man act at the hotel.


987
01:31:37.448 --> 01:31:39.406
That bald breeder is your boss, right?

988
01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:46.406
Look. How cute she is!
How can you torture this poor soul?


989
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:51.448
I've never seen a zoo sadist like you!

990
01:32:13.698 --> 01:32:15.073
Who said I torture her?

991
01:32:17.615 --> 01:32:18.698
I mean...

992
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:26.490
Wait.

993
01:32:26.531 --> 01:32:29.549
Pragati, looks
like the rescuer has to be rescued!


994
01:32:29.573 --> 01:32:30.341
Aye!

995
01:32:30.365 --> 01:32:33.882
We've checked the CCTV footage.

996
01:32:33.906 --> 01:32:35.240
Wait...

997
01:32:37.573 --> 01:32:38.174
Tell me now.

998
01:32:38.198 --> 01:32:42.341
Ma'am, it was Dharma
who thrashed the breeder like a hero!


999
01:32:42.365 --> 01:32:44.132
Didn't I tell you he's a nice man?

1000
01:32:44.156 --> 01:32:47.156
Come back now.
Such a waste to have gone all the way...


1001
01:32:54.365 --> 01:32:55.781
Come Charlie...

1002
01:33:01.948 --> 01:33:06.365
Thank you for saving all those dogs.

1003
01:33:09.406 --> 01:33:11.156
I'm going back tomorrow.

1004
01:33:12.198 --> 01:33:15.906
I came here in a hurry without
even informing my mom.


1005
01:33:16.323 --> 01:33:19.115
I'd appreciate if you could
drop me to the airport.


1006
01:33:20.031 --> 01:33:21.448
You can go and sleep inside.

1007
01:33:24.531 --> 01:33:25.531
Thanks.

1008
01:34:15.573 --> 01:34:18.507
Ma'am, the direct flight
is only available tomorrow evening.


1009
01:34:18.531 --> 01:34:20.091
Shall I book it for you?

1010
01:34:20.115 --> 01:34:21.115
Okay.

1011
01:34:42.656 --> 01:34:44.323
She follows you everywhere!

1012
01:34:44.573 --> 01:34:45.573
That's how she is.

1013
01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:48.156
She doesn't believe strangers.

1014
01:34:50.615 --> 01:34:52.341
I've been to Ladakh.

1015
01:34:52.365 --> 01:34:55.073
On the bullet. 
That too, a solo ride.

1016
01:34:55.448 --> 01:34:57.906
So, how far are you planning to ride?

1017
01:35:05.073 --> 01:35:06.448
Hey, where to?

1018
01:35:26.365 --> 01:35:27.341
Excuse me sir.

1019
01:35:27.365 --> 01:35:28.365
Yes?

1020
01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:30.716
Can you take my dog for paragliding?

1021
01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:31.966
Dog? No.

1022
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:33.799
Who takes the dog on paragliding?

1023
01:35:33.823 --> 01:35:34.823
Hi sir.

1024
01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.406
Yes madam!

1025
01:35:36.823 --> 01:35:39.656
She can. But the rule says
someone must accompany her.


1026
01:35:40.031 --> 01:35:42.198
They have a team.
Let one of them go with her.


1027
01:35:42.531 --> 01:35:45.573
One of us, is what he says.
Why don't you go?


1028
01:35:45.823 --> 01:35:48.323
Me? I can't.

1029
01:35:49.406 --> 01:35:51.240
Why? Scared?

1030
01:35:51.948 --> 01:35:54.281
No. I'm not interested, that's all.

1031
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:57.698
Why don't you go?
Charlie will be happy, too.


1032
01:35:58.156 --> 01:36:02.281
Charlie doesn't trust strangers.
So you go. All will be well.


1033
01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:28.990
I'm focused.

1034
01:36:29.406 --> 01:36:32.615
I've been watching for the omens.

1035
01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.382
I've been listening to
everything you've said,


1036
01:36:36.406 --> 01:36:38.448
It's been running through my head

1037
01:36:38.490 --> 01:36:41.156
locked and loaded.

1038
01:36:41.198 --> 01:36:44.948
I've got the feeling that you've noticed.

1039
01:36:46.365 --> 01:36:48.382
Yeah I've only just begun

1040
01:36:48.406 --> 01:36:50.174
I won't stop until it's done.

1041
01:36:50.198 --> 01:36:54.031
Till you're broken.

1042
01:36:57.448 --> 01:37:00.031
So welcome to the fire!

1043
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:03.823
I'm the one who lit the night up.

1044
01:37:06.323 --> 01:37:08.299
See them running through your fame,

1045
01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:10.382
As we're walking through the flames,

1046
01:37:10.406 --> 01:37:13.031
getting higher!

1047
01:37:13.573 --> 01:37:15.948
So welcome to the fire!

1048
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:20.115
Welcome to the fire!

1049
01:37:22.448 --> 01:37:24.257
See them running through your fame,

1050
01:37:24.281 --> 01:37:26.299
as we're walking through the flames,

1051
01:37:26.323 --> 01:37:29.115
getting higher!

1052
01:37:29.656 --> 01:37:32.490
So welcome to the fire!

1053
01:37:33.365 --> 01:37:37.091
I've been waiting for this moment.

1054
01:37:37.115 --> 01:37:42.341
The final battle of the chosen.

1055
01:37:42.365 --> 01:37:44.382
See I'm never gonna quit.

1056
01:37:44.406 --> 01:37:48.906
Got my legacy set in motion.

1057
01:37:49.573 --> 01:37:52.073
So welcome to the fire!

1058
01:37:53.948 --> 01:37:56.132
Welcome to the fire!

1059
01:37:56.156 --> 01:37:58.073
Charlie!

1060
01:37:58.448 --> 01:38:00.466
See them running through your fame,

1061
01:38:00.490 --> 01:38:02.341
as we're walking through the flames,

1062
01:38:02.365 --> 01:38:05.323
getting higher!

1063
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:08.198
Welcome to the fire...

1064
01:38:09.656 --> 01:38:12.531
Welcome to the fire.

1065
01:38:39.531 --> 01:38:42.740
Someone was on Cloud 9 along with Charlie!

1066
01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:51.240
Can I tell you something?

1067
01:38:53.281 --> 01:38:55.906
The positons dogs sleep in
reveal a lot about their feelings.


1068
01:38:56.948 --> 01:39:01.698
They sleep like this only when they
feel safe and are attached to someone.


1069
01:39:03.865 --> 01:39:05.906
She trusts you a lot.

1070
01:39:11.573 --> 01:39:14.156
I'm so happy to
be part of this event.

1071
01:39:15.073 --> 01:39:16.073
See you soon.

1072
01:39:17.656 --> 01:39:21.115
Charlie. From tomorrow,
the side cars is entirely yours.


1073
01:39:24.156 --> 01:39:25.156
What happened?

1074
01:39:27.531 --> 01:39:28.531
Wait, I'm coming.

1075
01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:33.740
Leave it.

1076
01:39:34.781 --> 01:39:37.990
How many times have I told you
not to roll in the mud...


1077
01:39:50.823 --> 01:39:52.663
Let's go? I have to be
at the airport by 7 pm.


1078
01:39:53.698 --> 01:39:54.240
Oh my god!

1079
01:39:54.615 --> 01:39:58.198
Are you crazy! Why don't you
keep a tab on these things? Move it.


1080
01:39:58.865 --> 01:40:01.781
It's a skin infection. 
It's dangerous.

1081
01:40:02.573 --> 01:40:05.323
Why have a dog if
you can't take care of it?


1082
01:40:06.281 --> 01:40:09.281
Poor Charlie...
This looks bad.


1083
01:40:12.031 --> 01:40:13.031
Cigarette.

1084
01:40:14.573 --> 01:40:16.115
Wait, I'll be back.

1085
01:41:06.073 --> 01:41:08.632
Lend your ear.

1086
01:41:08.656 --> 01:41:12.365
Let's spend some moments in happiness.

1087
01:41:14.115 --> 01:41:17.132
Hey... This gift of
nature you and I have.

1088
01:41:17.156 --> 01:41:19.823
I've missed my flight mom.

1089
01:41:20.198 --> 01:41:21.198
Okay.

1090
01:41:22.156 --> 01:41:27.966
Do come. Come let's enjoy.

1091
01:41:30.156 --> 01:41:32.591
Do come.

1092
01:41:32.615 --> 01:41:35.865
Let's forget the burden of sorrows for now.

1093
01:41:38.156 --> 01:41:40.299
Do come.

1094
01:41:40.323 --> 01:41:42.007
These flowing winds that come and go.

1095
01:41:42.031 --> 01:41:43.382
It's not just you whose luck is such;
Everyone has to face this.


1096
01:41:43.406 --> 01:41:45.573
I thought she was excited about ice-cream.

1097
01:41:47.865 --> 01:41:49.945
I realised it later it was the snow
that excited her.


1098
01:41:50.656 --> 01:41:54.573
Before something can go wrong,
I want her to see the snow.


1099
01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:59.507
Hey, don't worry. 
She'll be all right.

1100
01:41:59.531 --> 01:42:01.740
Your love will keep her strong.

1101
01:42:14.073 --> 01:42:15.740
Bear this in mind

1102
01:42:15.781 --> 01:42:17.799
things will not be like you intend.

1103
01:42:17.823 --> 01:42:21.466
Things are never the way they appear.

1104
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:23.466
That's the rule of this journey.

1105
01:42:23.490 --> 01:42:25.757
This is the gift of life.

1106
01:42:25.781 --> 01:42:30.007
In all these tough times, there is
a sweet taste of happiness, too.


1107
01:42:30.031 --> 01:42:32.007
Do come...

1108
01:42:32.031 --> 01:42:34.091
These flowing winds that come and go,

1109
01:42:34.115 --> 01:42:35.966
Do come...

1110
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:37.966
Sometimes salty, sometimes fresh.

1111
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:40.216
Do come...

1112
01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.966
This gift of nature,

1113
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:46.031
that you and I have,
we have to accept it with love.


1114
01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.240
Finish it fast Charlie. 
We've to leave.

1115
01:43:05.073 --> 01:43:06.073
Hi Devika!

1116
01:43:06.448 --> 01:43:07.174
Hey...

1117
01:43:07.198 --> 01:43:10.091
You look nice. It's been a while since I've
seen you. How are you?


1118
01:43:10.115 --> 01:43:10.757
I'm good.

1119
01:43:10.781 --> 01:43:13.156
I finally get to meet you.

1120
01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.615
This must be Charlie. Hey Charlie!
Hey Dharma.


1121
01:43:17.823 --> 01:43:18.823
Hi.

1122
01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:22.198
I'm Karshan Roy.
I work with Travel Diaries.


1123
01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:24.573
It's an international travel magazine.

1124
01:43:24.906 --> 01:43:27.049
Devika has told me everything about you.

1125
01:43:27.073 --> 01:43:28.615
And I thought it's really interesting.

1126
01:43:29.198 --> 01:43:32.632
So this time we want to
feature you on the cover.


1127
01:43:32.656 --> 01:43:34.906
I mean, about Charlie.

1128
01:43:35.156 --> 01:43:37.740
So can you please tell
us about your journey?


1129
01:43:46.948 --> 01:43:47.948
Let's go.

1130
01:44:28.115 --> 01:44:31.781
Wow! Unbelievable!

1131
01:44:32.573 --> 01:44:34.406
I'm sure Charlie's wishes will come true.

1132
01:44:34.906 --> 01:44:36.615
I will pray for her and for you.

1133
01:44:38.490 --> 01:44:42.948
And thank you very much for
your valuable time. Alright, let's go?


1134
01:44:43.073 --> 01:44:44.513
You carry on. I'll join you shortly.

1135
01:44:45.281 --> 01:44:46.281
Sure.

1136
01:44:49.198 --> 01:44:52.781
Lovely meeting you Dharma. Bye Charlie.
All right. Let's go.


1137
01:44:59.615 --> 01:45:00.615
He's a close friend.

1138
01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.781
We studied together in
Bengaluru. He lives here.


1139
01:45:04.906 --> 01:45:08.031
He forced me to come home
when he got to know I'm here.


1140
01:45:08.365 --> 01:45:10.906
I thought it'd be good
for him to meet you.

1141
01:45:11.448 --> 01:45:15.281
I also have a program me to attend.
So I've to go.


1142
01:45:16.906 --> 01:45:19.365
It was really a memorable journey.

1143
01:45:19.615 --> 01:45:22.115
Charlie will be all right, don't worry.

1144
01:45:24.323 --> 01:45:26.865
If you need any help,
feel free to call me.

1145
01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:30.073
Bye Charlie.

1146
01:45:32.865 --> 01:45:33.531
Bye.

1147
01:45:33.698 --> 01:45:34.698
Bye.

1148
01:45:38.031 --> 01:45:39.031
Let's go?

1149
01:45:39.531 --> 01:45:40.656
Jump in.

1150
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.990
What?

1151
01:45:54.906 --> 01:45:55.906
Okay enough.

1152
01:45:57.531 --> 01:45:58.531
Enough.

1153
01:46:04.865 --> 01:46:06.674
Don't be so sad Charlie.

1154
01:46:06.698 --> 01:46:08.216
It was the two of us
who started this journey.


1155
01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:09.320
So let's continue doing so.

1156
01:46:29.115 --> 01:46:32.865
Maybe when luck decides to chuck,
this is how it looks Charlie.


1157
01:46:51.823 --> 01:46:53.466
Where in Karnataka are you from?

1158
01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:54.966
Sir, Mysuru.

1159
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:56.240
I'm from Tamil Nadu.

1160
01:46:57.865 --> 01:46:58.966
Do you know Tamil?

1161
01:46:58.990 --> 01:47:00.299
A little bit, sir.

1162
01:47:00.323 --> 01:47:02.365
Oh, nice!

1163
01:47:03.656 --> 01:47:04.990
Your name?

1164
01:47:05.323 --> 01:47:06.323
Dharma.

1165
01:47:07.365 --> 01:47:09.740
Myself Vamsi. Vamsinadhan.

1166
01:47:10.698 --> 01:47:14.906
This is my son. Karuppa.
Your son's name?


1167
01:47:15.781 --> 01:47:18.031
Daughter. She's Charlie.

1168
01:47:18.281 --> 01:47:19.656
Oh...

1169
01:47:20.823 --> 01:47:24.698
Hey, Karuppa, no!

1170
01:47:25.490 --> 01:47:28.365
Hi Charlie, welcome to my home!

1171
01:47:42.156 --> 01:47:45.740
These are Karuppa's medals
from various dog shows.


1172
01:47:46.323 --> 01:47:48.632
- Dharma right?
- Yes.


1173
01:47:48.656 --> 01:47:51.365
Do you want to eat now?
Or do you want to freshen up first?


1174
01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:53.865
I think I'll freshen up.

1175
01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:03.156
So you've set off to see the snow...

1176
01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:15.823
When people you love the most leave,
it hurts. Isn't it Karuppa?


1177
01:48:17.365 --> 01:48:18.882
Sir, your wife?

1178
01:48:18.906 --> 01:48:19.906
Oh.

1179
01:48:21.073 --> 01:48:23.031
I haven't told you about it yet!

1180
01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:28.198
Her name is Rani.
Our's is first sight at love!


1181
01:48:28.781 --> 01:48:29.941
But our parents didn't agree.

1182
01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:33.698
So we eloped and settled down here.

1183
01:48:34.073 --> 01:48:39.781
She worked at a bank near by.
We were so happy!


1184
01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:44.698
We led a wonderful life.
But we couldn't have kids.


1185
01:48:44.948 --> 01:48:46.573
We consulted many doctors.

1186
01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:49.615
They told us we could never have kids.

1187
01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:52.740
The problem was with me.

1188
01:48:56.573 --> 01:49:00.740
After that, I went into depression.

1189
01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:08.073
Then one day,
my wife gave me a wonderful gift!


1190
01:49:08.823 --> 01:49:11.281
Guess what?

1191
01:49:13.198 --> 01:49:16.031
My son, Karuppa!

1192
01:49:18.448 --> 01:49:22.240
My life transformed after he came.

1193
01:49:24.490 --> 01:49:29.240
Then Rani gave me another big surprise.

1194
01:49:30.115 --> 01:49:32.615
There was a letter on the table.
But I didn't open it.


1195
01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.132
My help Veluchami told me that...

1196
01:49:37.156 --> 01:49:38.507
she...

1197
01:49:38.531 --> 01:49:40.073
Aye, it's ok.

1198
01:49:40.573 --> 01:49:43.615
She eloped with her colleague. Anyway...

1199
01:49:44.906 --> 01:49:45.906
Leave it.

1200
01:49:47.823 --> 01:49:54.115
Poor girl, how long would she have
tolerated two fools like us!


1201
01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:59.031
She left.

1202
01:49:59.865 --> 01:50:06.281
Karuppu, I hope you never leave me.
Should you even think about it, I'll kill you!


1203
01:50:09.781 --> 01:50:12.781
Come, let's dance.

1204
01:50:36.906 --> 01:50:38.948
Hey... Charlie...

1205
01:50:43.865 --> 01:50:47.781
Hey Dharma, morning!
Slept well?


1206
01:50:48.115 --> 01:50:49.948
Yes sir, slept well.

1207
01:50:51.365 --> 01:50:52.490
There's some fresh fish.

1208
01:50:53.156 --> 01:50:55.865
You freshen up and come.
Let's feast on it!


1209
01:50:56.781 --> 01:50:57.823
Veluchami!

1210
01:51:02.073 --> 01:51:04.091
Come with me there are miles to go.

1211
01:51:04.115 --> 01:51:06.132
Ain't nothing in our way at all.

1212
01:51:06.156 --> 01:51:09.632
Let seasons come,
the leaves may grow or fall.


1213
01:51:09.656 --> 01:51:10.656
Oh yeah.

1214
01:51:11.323 --> 01:51:13.882
Summer winds cool the
way as we travel far.

1215
01:51:13.906 --> 01:51:15.632
Winter sun to keep us warm.

1216
01:51:15.656 --> 01:51:20.115
We follow the rainbow
to find a pot of gold.


1217
01:51:22.031 --> 01:51:23.031
Cheers!

1218
01:51:23.156 --> 01:51:24.240
Cheers!

1219
01:51:26.031 --> 01:51:27.924
Charlie...

1220
01:51:35.448 --> 01:51:38.007
On the way we'll face the weather.

1221
01:51:38.031 --> 01:51:39.757
Hold my hands we'll roam together.

1222
01:51:39.781 --> 01:51:44.240
Don't let go for I can't walk alone.

1223
01:51:45.198 --> 01:51:47.549
Fallen leaves look pretty
when you're by my side.


1224
01:51:47.573 --> 01:51:49.174
Old paths feel fresh and fine.

1225
01:51:49.198 --> 01:51:54.490
The clouds all look like you
when they fall upon my eyes.


1226
01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:58.132
Hey Karuppa, the swing is broken.

1227
01:51:58.156 --> 01:52:01.531
Go play somewhere else.
I'll repair it later.


1228
01:52:07.031 --> 01:52:09.448
Veerji, that'll be 20,000 bucks.

1229
01:52:09.531 --> 01:52:10.257
20,000 bucks?

1230
01:52:10.281 --> 01:52:11.031
Yes sir.

1231
01:52:11.156 --> 01:52:14.882
Have you forgotten our horse trade?

1232
01:52:14.906 --> 01:52:17.156
Yes Veerji. Consider
that deal to be sealed.


1233
01:52:17.365 --> 01:52:20.490
Keep 15,000 bucks. Good day.

1234
01:52:21.115 --> 01:52:22.698
Okay Veerji. Good day.

1235
01:52:54.281 --> 01:52:57.823
Hey.. Come on Charlie.. 
Karuppa..here.

1236
01:53:02.615 --> 01:53:04.865
Yes.. Made for each other.

1237
01:53:09.781 --> 01:53:12.781
Ah! Already love sick?

1238
01:53:13.198 --> 01:53:16.656
My Karuppa is already heart broken
because you're leaving.


1239
01:53:18.115 --> 01:53:20.132
So then? Leaving huh?

1240
01:53:20.156 --> 01:53:22.698
Yes, thank you so much.

1241
01:53:24.198 --> 01:53:30.573
Dharma, we may come from different states.
But the water we drink is the same!


1242
01:53:32.615 --> 01:53:34.656
No formality between us.

1243
01:53:34.823 --> 01:53:38.341
Dharma, I have something for you.

1244
01:53:38.365 --> 01:53:42.966
This is a participant pass to the
national-level dog show in Ludhiana next week.


1245
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:44.698
This time I won't be participating.

1246
01:53:45.531 --> 01:53:48.466
If you have the time, go watch it.

1247
01:53:48.490 --> 01:53:53.091
It's a dog world. You and Charlie will
have the best experience. Trust me.


1248
01:53:53.115 --> 01:53:54.281
Sure.

1249
01:53:59.198 --> 01:54:04.615
Dharma, When you finish the trip,
come and meet us on your way home.


1250
01:54:05.031 --> 01:54:06.031
Bye.

1251
01:54:11.781 --> 01:54:17.615
This is hard!
Come let's go fishing, Karuppa.


1252
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:21.656
Karuppa...

1253
01:54:24.906 --> 01:54:27.299
The Nobel laureate
Konrad Lorenz once said,


1254
01:54:27.323 --> 01:54:31.757
“The bond with a true dog is as lasting
as the ties of this earth will ever be.”


1255
01:54:31.781 --> 01:54:34.757
Welcome to the National
Agility Dog Championship 2020.


1256
01:54:34.781 --> 01:54:37.966
In association with the Animal Welfare
Association of India.


1257
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:41.132
A warm welcome to all the participants who
have gathered at this event.


1258
01:54:41.156 --> 01:54:43.466
And have made this into a massive one.

1259
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:44.549
Excuse me sir.

1260
01:54:44.573 --> 01:54:47.507
Today we have gathered
here at Ludhiana, Fields of Dreams stadium


1261
01:54:47.531 --> 01:54:48.882

1262
01:54:48.906 --> 01:54:53.615
We are truly overwhelmed with the amazing
response we have received for this event.


1263
01:55:06.698 --> 01:55:08.216

1265
01:55:11.073 --> 01:55:14.049
Also, first time particants who are
a little nervous and a little excited.


1266
01:55:14.073 --> 01:55:15.341
Relax and enjoy.

1267
01:55:15.365 --> 01:55:18.132
- This is what the Agility Championship is all about friends.
- All the best.


1268
01:55:18.156 --> 01:55:19.007
Fun for the dogs

1269
01:55:19.031 --> 01:55:20.049
fun for the handlers

1270
01:55:20.073 --> 01:55:23.674
and fun for the spectators
watching this show across the globe!


1271
01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:28.466
Without taking much of your
time, let's get the show started right away.


1272
01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:30.841
Welcome our Judges on

saved people from danger


1274
01:55:33.948 --> 01:55:36.924
but also bravely stood by
the nation during war crisis.


1275
01:55:36.948 --> 01:55:40.115
Please welcome Mr. Pradham

1280
01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:02.049

1281
01:56:02.073 --> 01:56:06.424
When we have such prestigious judges here
with us today, what more can be asked for?


1282
01:56:06.448 --> 01:56:10.174
Let's give it up for our first
participants, Mr. Ashok Rathod and Sarama.


1283
01:56:10.198 --> 01:56:13.174
- Our three times championship winner here at NADC.
- Come on Ashok!


1284
01:56:13.198 --> 01:56:14.948
They look pretty confident.

1285
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:17.341
Let's see if they can the
trophy home this year.


1286
01:56:17.365 --> 01:56:19.257
That's a quick start with a
smooth double hurdle jump.


1287
01:56:19.281 --> 01:56:20.615
Moving past the tunnel.

1288
01:56:21.698 --> 01:56:23.490
Quickly through the dog walk.

1289
01:56:23.948 --> 01:56:25.424
A smooth ring jump.

1290
01:56:25.448 --> 01:56:27.740
Tricky yet amazingly past the wave pool.

1291
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:30.198
There seems to be a bit of
a contact with the obstacle.


1292
01:56:30.531 --> 01:56:31.882
Swiftly through the long bar jump.

1293
01:56:31.906 --> 01:56:33.073
Inside the tunnel again.

1294
01:56:33.615 --> 01:56:35.365
Moving through the see-saw.

1295
01:56:35.823 --> 01:56:37.174
Leading to the A-frame.

1296
01:56:37.198 --> 01:56:39.716
And the final jump!

1297
01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:43.698
What a spectacular performance by Sarama,
a two and half year old Belgian Malinois.


1298
01:56:47.698 --> 01:56:53.299
And now, lets give a huge around of applause
for our second participant, Mr.Kashi from Lucknow.


1299
01:56:53.323 --> 01:56:54.757
Hi.

1300
01:56:54.781 --> 01:56:58.091
Along with his 2 year old doberman who
was the first runner up of the 24th NADC.


1301
01:56:58.115 --> 01:56:59.323
What brings you here?

1302
01:57:01.448 --> 01:57:02.906
Participant?

1303
01:57:05.823 --> 01:57:06.990
All the best!

1304
01:57:56.656 --> 01:57:58.424
They take the
first jump over the hurdle.


1305
01:57:58.448 --> 01:58:01.174
Remarkable pace. Truly
tremendously through the tunnel.


1306
01:58:01.198 --> 01:58:04.882
Good connect with the dog over the ramp.
And nice smooth jump from the ring.


1307
01:58:04.906 --> 01:58:06.716
Nicely through the wavepools.

1308
01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:08.549
It's lovely to watch them perform together.

1309
01:58:08.573 --> 01:58:11.799
That's the highest jump any dog
has taken so far, ladies and gentlemen.


1310
01:58:11.823 --> 01:58:13.882
They seem to be doing
great for the first time.


1311
01:58:13.906 --> 01:58:16.906
That's the final jump that has been taken.

1312
01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:19.424
And they finish it.

1313
01:58:19.448 --> 01:58:23.299
So let's welcome our
next participant Dharma and Charlie.


1314
01:58:23.323 --> 01:58:26.073
A one and half year old female Labrador.

1315
01:58:33.948 --> 01:58:36.549
Look at the energy
and the enthusiasm of Charlie.


1316
01:58:36.573 --> 01:58:39.906
Looks like she wants to quickly finish
and take the trophy home.


1317
01:58:41.448 --> 01:58:42.781
Charlie...

1318
01:58:54.031 --> 01:58:54.656
Uh-oh.

1319
01:58:54.865 --> 01:58:57.882
That was bit of a
wrong start to the agility.


1320
01:58:57.906 --> 01:58:58.841
What's happening there?

1321
01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:00.323
Must be for the food!

1322
01:59:00.656 --> 01:59:06.406
Well, she certainly seems to be entertaining
the spectators and the judges in a totally different way.


1323
01:59:07.573 --> 01:59:09.573
Hello, excuse me!

1324
01:59:10.573 --> 01:59:12.698
What the hell is happening man?

1325
01:59:13.031 --> 01:59:17.132
You're unable to handle your own pet!
In addition, you're wasting all our time!


1326
01:59:17.156 --> 01:59:20.823
Sir actually we are not here
to participate - Oh really??


1327
01:59:22.031 --> 01:59:25.031
Do you even understand where
you are standing right now?


1328
01:59:26.115 --> 01:59:27.966
Do we look like buffoons?

1329
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:29.507
That's what he thinks.

1330
01:59:29.531 --> 01:59:31.073
What's the name again?

1331
01:59:31.406 --> 01:59:32.531
Charlie.

1332
01:59:32.781 --> 01:59:33.716
Charlie.

1333
01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:36.448
Chaplin. Good combination.

1334
01:59:36.948 --> 01:59:41.240
In my 13 years of experience,
I have never seen anything like this.


1335
01:59:42.323 --> 01:59:44.781
Ruined the show for us!

1336
01:59:52.281 --> 01:59:55.531
Looks like your dog is
more intelligent than you.


1337
02:00:07.698 --> 02:00:08.740
Shut up!

1338
02:00:17.698 --> 02:00:21.823
Just eat, roam and sleep!
Can you do anything else?


1339
02:00:25.531 --> 02:00:27.906
Never show me your face again!

1340
02:00:31.115 --> 02:00:34.573
Be with me.

1341
02:00:35.656 --> 02:00:39.698
In this classroom called life.

1342
02:00:40.156 --> 02:00:48.156
I shall be your
friend and stay by you.

1343
02:00:49.031 --> 02:00:56.656
I shall follow you everywhere.

1344
02:00:58.198 --> 02:01:06.198
And share unspoken tales.

1345
02:01:09.281 --> 02:01:13.573
You're my life lesson.

1346
02:01:14.073 --> 02:01:18.632
You're my biggest trophy.

1347
02:01:18.656 --> 02:01:23.632
Hold my hand.

1348
02:01:23.656 --> 02:01:27.174
And take care my friend.

1349
02:01:27.198 --> 02:01:30.531
My dear friend.

1350
02:01:47.365 --> 02:01:55.365
Be like the nest that listens
to the chirping of the birds.


1351
02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:05.240
You're the peacock feather that
adorns the chapters of my life.


1352
02:02:06.531 --> 02:02:14.531
Come to me and I'll teach
you to make a paper boat.


1353
02:02:15.448 --> 02:02:23.448
I'll follow you and write a story.

1354
02:02:24.281 --> 02:02:32.281
That's dedicated to you but
hidden to the rest of the world.


1355
02:02:43.323 --> 02:02:51.323
When I'm with you, even the moon's
company seems insignificant.


1356
02:02:53.406 --> 02:03:01.406
Your smile is priceless.

1357
02:03:02.531 --> 02:03:10.531
And it's my privilege to spend
my days surrounded by it.


1358
02:03:11.365 --> 02:03:19.365
I will follow and join you.

1359
02:03:20.448 --> 02:03:24.531
And I'll sing you a song.

1360
02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:29.091
That I'll sing for none else but you.

1361
02:03:29.115 --> 02:03:33.757
You're my life lesson.

1362
02:03:33.781 --> 02:03:38.507
You're my biggest trophy.

1363
02:03:38.531 --> 02:03:43.507
Hold my hand.

1364
02:03:43.531 --> 02:03:47.091
And take care my friend.

1365
02:03:47.115 --> 02:03:49.573
My dear friend.

1366
02:04:12.531 --> 02:04:14.632
Camera 3, pan to the dog.

1367
02:04:14.656 --> 02:04:16.406
Yes fix.

1368
02:04:23.115 --> 02:04:25.216
You think she can make it?

1369
02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:26.990
Impossible.

1370
02:04:49.198 --> 02:04:52.174
Ladies and
gentlemen this is truly impressive.


1371
02:04:52.198 --> 02:04:58.549
Histroy has been made out here
with this performance at the 25th NADC.


1372
02:04:58.573 --> 02:05:00.799
I mean look at the audience around us.

1373
02:05:00.823 --> 02:05:04.424
All of them standing on their feet,
giving a fantastic standing ovation.


1374
02:05:04.448 --> 02:05:06.257
Watching this truly beautiful bond!

1375
02:05:06.281 --> 02:05:08.906
Love you Charlie!

1376
02:06:00.906 --> 02:06:03.990
Anyway, there are lots of
Charlies back home, too.


1377
02:06:04.448 --> 02:06:08.174
Mom called to say they're all missing me.

1378
02:06:08.198 --> 02:06:10.073
So I'm off.

1379
02:06:11.156 --> 02:06:14.091
The first time I came to your house,
I had fixed a tracker on Charlie.


1380
02:06:14.115 --> 02:06:16.740
I'll come looking for
her whenever I miss her.


1381
02:06:16.990 --> 02:06:17.990
Okay?

1382
02:06:18.365 --> 02:06:22.382
As someone who has always lived a confined life, I
discovered just how beautiful life is,


1383
02:06:22.406 --> 02:06:23.966
only when I stepped out into the world.

1384
02:06:25.031 --> 02:06:29.591
Life has been painted with new colours,
with new memories at every juncture.


1385
02:06:29.615 --> 02:06:34.240
My heart yearns for
this journey to never end!


1386
02:07:37.073 --> 02:07:40.365
Haven't I worked
without taking leave for so long?


1387
02:07:40.781 --> 02:07:42.031
No, I can't sir.

1388
02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:43.948
How can they hold my salary?

1389
02:07:44.823 --> 02:07:46.143
What should I have informed, sir?

1390
02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:48.906
Haven't I worked this long?
So I am entitled to my salary!


1391
02:07:50.906 --> 02:07:54.281
No need. I know how to get it!

1392
02:08:07.281 --> 02:08:08.281
Charlie...

1393
02:08:50.323 --> 02:08:52.865
Hello sir. I've come from Mysuru.

1394
02:08:54.156 --> 02:08:55.615
I've run out of money.

1395
02:08:57.448 --> 02:08:59.248
My dog hasn't eaten
anything since yesterday.


1396
02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:06.115
Please keep this mobile and give us food.

1397
02:09:10.281 --> 02:09:11.281
Chotu...

1398
02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:22.320
Hello...

1399
02:09:23.406 --> 02:09:25.031
Who is that, dear?

1400
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.990
[SON?]

1401
02:09:35.823 --> 02:09:36.823
[DHARMA?]

1402
02:10:05.906 --> 02:10:06.906
Come Charlie, let's go.

1403
02:10:12.531 --> 02:10:15.406
It's not our's anymore, come let's go.

1404
02:10:26.823 --> 02:10:27.823
Charlie, please.

1405
02:10:47.073 --> 02:10:54.406
Smile at your child.

1406
02:10:56.740 --> 02:11:04.490
My feet and my prayers both wonʼt work.

1407
02:11:05.781 --> 02:11:11.906
Smile at your child.

1408
02:11:37.531 --> 02:11:45.531
Compassion my lord.

1409
02:11:46.615 --> 02:11:49.632
I'm setting out on this path.

1410
02:11:49.656 --> 02:11:52.799
Please allow me to come close to you.

1411
02:11:52.823 --> 02:11:55.549
Give me such companionship throughout.

1412
02:11:55.573 --> 02:11:58.466
That my forehead now only
bows at your sacred place.


1413
02:11:58.490 --> 02:12:01.341
There are a thousand
hinderances along the way.


1414
02:12:01.365 --> 02:12:04.573
But you can make it go away.

1415
02:12:04.615 --> 02:12:07.466
Give me such companionship throughout.

1416
02:12:07.490 --> 02:12:10.448
That my forehead now only
bows at your sacred place.


1417
02:12:16.698 --> 02:12:21.740
I ask you to watch over
and I ask for nothing else.


1418
02:12:22.115 --> 02:12:28.174
Turn your face to me
god and smile at your child.


1419
02:12:28.198 --> 02:12:34.174
If you stay oblivious
my feet and my prayers both wonʼt work.


1420
02:12:34.198 --> 02:12:40.216
Turn your face to me
god and smile at your child.


1421
02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:43.781
Smile at your child.

1422
02:13:31.573 --> 02:13:35.466
We can't guarantee you anything.
Nor are we sure how long you need to stay here.


1423
02:13:35.490 --> 02:13:38.865
She was pregnant, but
her puppies are no more.


1424
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:41.882
Who is to be held responsible?

1425
02:13:41.906 --> 02:13:44.882
For this grievous and unforeseen end.

1426
02:13:44.906 --> 02:13:50.549
I curse this dreadful fate.

1427
02:13:50.573 --> 02:13:53.466
My luck has withered away.

1428
02:13:53.490 --> 02:13:56.591
Time has played its twisted game.

1429
02:13:56.615 --> 02:13:59.966
Eyes are moist, heart is shattered.

1430
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:02.924
Every step forward is brimming with pain.

1431
02:14:02.948 --> 02:14:08.507
I place before you a humble prayer.

1432
02:14:08.531 --> 02:14:14.507
Show the path and save
us from this cruel suffering.


1433
02:14:14.531 --> 02:14:20.507
Shower your mercy oh Lord.

1434
02:14:20.531 --> 02:14:26.531
Put an end to my misery.

1435
02:14:26.573 --> 02:14:32.549
Shower your mercy oh Lord.

1436
02:14:32.573 --> 02:14:36.031
Put an end to my misery.

1437
02:15:09.115 --> 02:15:10.115
Charlie...

1438
02:15:17.156 --> 02:15:18.156
Charlie.

1439
02:15:20.073 --> 02:15:21.615
How much do you love me?

1440
02:15:41.531 --> 02:15:42.865
I love you too, Charlie.

1441
02:15:50.031 --> 02:15:52.615
A cloud of faith,

1442
02:15:52.906 --> 02:15:55.490
laid with prayers.

1443
02:15:55.990 --> 02:16:01.115
Is bringing hope into our deserted life.

1444
02:16:01.448 --> 02:16:04.424
I have long forgotten
the sound of laughter.


1445
02:16:04.448 --> 02:16:07.531
Baggage of sorrow is growing heavier.

1446
02:16:07.573 --> 02:16:11.007
Every door towards light seems shut.

1447
02:16:11.031 --> 02:16:14.007
My dearest is moving away from me.

1448
02:16:14.031 --> 02:16:19.549
Hear my prayers oh Lord!
Let my dear one live!


1449
02:16:19.573 --> 02:16:22.740
Hey cutie...

1450
02:16:25.323 --> 02:16:26.990
No. Don't touch.

1451
02:16:28.281 --> 02:16:30.406
Mom dog's name is Charlie.

1452
02:16:31.490 --> 02:16:34.591
Shower your mercy oh Lord.

1453
02:16:34.615 --> 02:16:40.466
Put an end to my misery.

1454
02:16:40.490 --> 02:16:46.466
Shower your mercy oh Lord.

1455
02:16:46.490 --> 02:16:48.632
Put an end to my misery.

1456
02:16:48.656 --> 02:16:50.156
Stop. Stop!

1457
02:16:53.281 --> 02:16:57.716
Dharma at this stage,
Charlie doesn't have much time.


1458
02:16:57.740 --> 02:17:00.573
[WHATEVER YOU WISH TO
DO FOR HER, DO IT SOON!]


1459
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:31.031
Charlie.

1460
02:17:42.865 --> 02:17:46.841
There's been a landslide.
Roads are closed for now.


1461
02:17:46.865 --> 02:17:49.240
We request you to kindly co-operate.

1462
02:17:56.615 --> 02:17:58.716
Do not let
any vehicles go ahead.


1463
02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:01.716
The convoy will be here in sometime.
I need the list of all the rescuers.


1464
02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.841
Sir, what happened?

1465
02:18:03.865 --> 02:18:05.549
There's a landslide ahead.

1466
02:18:05.573 --> 02:18:06.773
When will you permit movement?

1467
02:18:07.115 --> 02:18:10.841
I said you can't go.
There's been a landslide.


1468
02:18:10.865 --> 02:18:13.091
Sir, that's not possible.
I can't go back.


1469
02:18:13.115 --> 02:18:15.635
I have travel led too far.
I need to reach before it's too late.


1470
02:18:15.740 --> 02:18:20.632
Don't you get it?
There's a landslide ahead.


1471
02:18:20.656 --> 02:18:22.716
I don't care, sir! 
I have come from far!

1472
02:18:22.740 --> 02:18:24.174
I have a dog, too.

1473
02:18:24.198 --> 02:18:26.299
What is he blabbering?
Please take him away.


1474
02:18:26.323 --> 02:18:27.716
Sir, please sir!

1475
02:18:27.740 --> 02:18:30.132
Let me
see how you'll go any further.


1476
02:18:30.156 --> 02:18:31.674
Please sir try to understand!

1477
02:18:31.698 --> 02:18:32.299
I said go back!

1478
02:18:32.323 --> 02:18:34.740
Mr.Bakshi, what's going on?

1479
02:18:35.031 --> 02:18:36.174
Sir, this fellow is crazy.

1480
02:18:36.198 --> 02:18:40.382
Just doesn't get it despite telling him
that the roads are closed.


1481
02:18:40.406 --> 02:18:44.841
Sir, he's not letting me go to the other side.
Please help me.


1482
02:18:44.865 --> 02:18:47.841
My dog is unwell.
I need to show her snow at the earliest.


1483
02:18:47.865 --> 02:18:49.716
If I don't do it today,
it might be too late.


1484
02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:51.115
Please sir... I beg you!

1485
02:18:51.406 --> 02:18:53.740
Please sir...

1486
02:19:03.906 --> 02:19:05.198
So how's Charlie now?

1487
02:19:10.115 --> 02:19:11.406
She is okay.

1488
02:19:12.948 --> 02:19:14.448
When I got to know your story,

1489
02:19:16.031 --> 02:19:17.656
I was reminded of my army dogs.

1490
02:19:18.656 --> 02:19:22.424
Either they leave us, or we leave them.

1491
02:19:22.448 --> 02:19:26.281
The one who gets left behind,
is the one who suffers.


1492
02:19:34.281 --> 02:19:35.281
[TRANSCEIVER]

1493
02:19:37.073 --> 02:19:40.406
Listen Dharma, I know what this
journey means to you and Charlie.


1494
02:19:41.448 --> 02:19:45.757
But there's been a landslide and
the situation is really bad.


1495
02:19:45.781 --> 02:19:48.507
I don't know when the roads will open.

1496
02:19:48.531 --> 02:19:51.007
But there's a convoy that is
going to Kashmir tomorrow.


1497
02:19:51.031 --> 02:19:54.281
You will find the snow there too,
you can join them.


1498
02:19:55.406 --> 02:19:56.882
You can stay here for the night.

1499
02:19:56.906 --> 02:19:57.906
Sir.

1500
02:19:59.031 --> 02:20:01.031
How do you know about me and Charlie?

1501
02:20:02.156 --> 02:20:05.156
Oh! You are famous my friend!

1502
02:20:06.031 --> 02:20:07.406
Where is it?

1503
02:20:08.323 --> 02:20:09.323
Here.

1504
02:20:11.281 --> 02:20:13.573
"A Tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug."

1505
02:20:17.573 --> 02:20:19.156
The whole world knows your story.

1506
02:20:23.531 --> 02:20:24.781
Best wishes my friend.

1507
02:20:28.656 --> 02:20:32.490
Here the temperature drops steeply at night.
Take care.


1508
02:20:34.156 --> 02:20:35.156
Mr. Bakshi.

1509
02:20:38.448 --> 02:20:41.888
I am told that if we travel towards Kashmir
tomorrow, we might be able to see the snow.


1510
02:20:44.156 --> 02:20:45.740
But time!

1511
02:20:48.406 --> 02:20:49.716
Charlie's every breath...

1512
02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:52.073
was a reminder that we didn't
have much time in our hands.


1513
02:22:28.031 --> 02:22:32.740
Charlie, have you seen snow before this?

1514
02:22:33.615 --> 02:22:36.531
This is my first time ever.

1515
02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:23.281
I'm tired Charlie. You carry on.

1516
02:26:12.156 --> 02:26:15.882
Sir, it was a sight you missed!
She was so happy!


1517
02:26:15.906 --> 02:26:16.716
Where were you?

1518
02:26:16.740 --> 02:26:17.740
Sir, just close by.

1519
02:26:17.823 --> 02:26:19.549
I miss you Charlie.

1520
02:26:19.573 --> 02:26:22.257
Adrika, she still hasn't showed 'thanks'.

1521
02:26:22.281 --> 02:26:25.882
Really Charlie? 
You haven't thanked yet?

1522
02:26:25.906 --> 02:26:27.924
Dharma as you said,

1523
02:26:27.948 --> 02:26:31.257
you should come visit me and Karuppu
before going back.


1524
02:26:31.281 --> 02:26:33.424
What is she up to now?

1525
02:26:33.448 --> 02:26:34.448
Sleeping.

1526
02:26:35.531 --> 02:26:37.299
[WE SHOULD MEET AS
SOON AS YOU COME BACK.]

1527
02:26:37.323 --> 02:26:38.323
Sure.

1528
02:26:38.573 --> 02:26:39.573
[Good night]

1529
02:26:39.823 --> 02:26:40.823
Good night Devika.

1530
02:26:43.323 --> 02:26:44.323
Are you happy Charlie?

1531
02:26:46.698 --> 02:26:47.698
I know that,

1532
02:26:48.740 --> 02:26:51.198
this has been a memorable day for you.

1533
02:26:53.490 --> 02:26:54.865
It's the same for me too.

1534
02:26:57.573 --> 02:26:59.156
Let's take a flight home.

1535
02:27:00.948 --> 02:27:02.615
Everyone's waiting for you.

1536
02:27:08.781 --> 02:27:09.906
Good night, Charlie.

1537
02:27:18.115 --> 02:27:19.115
Charlie!

1538
02:27:36.573 --> 02:27:38.365
Charlie.

1539
02:27:45.781 --> 02:27:46.781
Charlie!

1540
02:27:47.531 --> 02:27:48.507
Sir, have you seen Charlie?

1541
02:27:48.531 --> 02:27:49.531
No.

1542
02:27:52.281 --> 02:27:53.365
Have you seen Charlie?

1543
02:27:53.406 --> 02:27:54.615
No.

1544
02:27:56.615 --> 02:27:57.615
Charlie!

1545
02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:06.174
What happened?

1546
02:28:06.198 --> 02:28:07.490
Sir, have you seen Charlie?

1547
02:28:08.198 --> 02:28:09.198
No.

1548
02:28:16.906 --> 02:28:17.906
Charlie!

1549
02:28:22.948 --> 02:28:23.948
Charlie!

1550
02:28:26.365 --> 02:28:27.365
Charlie!

1551
02:28:30.281 --> 02:28:31.281
Charlie!

1552
02:28:40.156 --> 02:28:41.323
What happened?!

1553
02:28:54.948 --> 02:28:56.115
Charlie!

1554
02:29:01.906 --> 02:29:02.906
Charlie!

1555
02:29:07.823 --> 02:29:08.823
Charlie!

1556
02:29:18.115 --> 02:29:19.490
Charlie!

1557
02:29:22.823 --> 02:29:24.073
Charlie!

1558
02:29:31.656 --> 02:29:32.781
Charlie!

1559
02:30:00.865 --> 02:30:01.990
Charlie!

1560
02:30:04.073 --> 02:30:05.073
Charlie!

1561
02:30:27.615 --> 02:30:28.906
Charlie!

1562
02:30:32.073 --> 02:30:33.073
Charlie!

1563
02:30:39.948 --> 02:30:41.281
Charlie!

1564
02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:44.906
Charlie!

1565
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:22.906
Why did you leave me
and come here Charlie?


1566
02:32:24.865 --> 02:32:26.425
Do you know how much
I searched for you?


1567
02:32:32.031 --> 02:32:34.115
I've lost everyone I've loved.

1568
02:32:36.573 --> 02:32:39.948
I thought I could somehow save you.

1569
02:32:45.115 --> 02:32:47.031
It's hurting me so much Charlie!

1570
02:32:51.240 --> 02:32:53.281
I don't know what to do.

1571
02:32:56.115 --> 02:32:58.906
I tried my best.

1572
02:32:59.740 --> 02:33:01.906
Doctors, prayers...

1573
02:33:04.573 --> 02:33:07.281
But I'm unable to save you.

1574
02:33:19.156 --> 02:33:21.757
[Thanks gesture]

1575
02:33:21.781 --> 02:33:27.156
[Charlie, you had shown the 'thanks' gesture.
Please do it again.]


1576
02:33:43.906 --> 02:33:45.490
How much do you love me, Charlie?

1577
02:33:49.115 --> 02:33:53.781
Charlie, have you seen snow before this?

1578
02:33:58.198 --> 02:34:01.031
This is my first time ever.

1579
02:34:08.448 --> 02:34:11.406
Sir, the dog came running
behind the ambulance.


1580
02:34:11.448 --> 02:34:14.257
He transformed my life.

1581
02:34:14.281 --> 02:34:16.299
Uncle, why don't you ever smile?

1582
02:34:16.323 --> 02:34:17.823
Charlie!

1583
02:34:18.406 --> 02:34:19.406
This is my dog.

1584
02:34:19.615 --> 02:34:21.406
Brother, please come with us.

1585
02:34:24.073 --> 02:34:24.841
I have quit smoking.

1586
02:34:24.865 --> 02:34:26.591
Dharma sir has changed so much!

1587
02:34:26.615 --> 02:34:27.740
Charlie!

1588
02:34:27.781 --> 02:34:29.156
Karuppa, you're in love, huh?

1589
02:34:31.365 --> 02:34:34.198
The way a dog sleeps,
reveals a lot about its feelings.


1590
02:34:35.406 --> 02:34:36.966
She trusts you a lot.

1591
02:34:36.990 --> 02:34:38.591
[A performance to remember out here.]

1592
02:34:38.615 --> 02:34:41.924
[Let's give it up for Dharma & Charlie
and that beautiful love they share.]

02:34:41.948 --> 02:34:44.073
"A tale of Dharmaraj in Kaliyug."

1594
02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:50.281
I can't handle this pain...

1595
02:37:38.906 --> 02:37:43.615
Charlie knew I'd be
unable to live without her.


1596
02:37:44.781 --> 02:37:48.615
That's why she left
me with a little Charlie.


1597
02:37:52.781 --> 02:37:54.281
Like I said earlier,

1598
02:37:55.781 --> 02:37:59.698
If you are lucky,
a Charlie will come into your life too.


1599
02:38:02.031 --> 02:38:03.740
But... only if you are lucky.

1600
02:38:46.906 --> 02:38:52.406
Towards the end, I realised that the past
is always tense and the future is perfect.


1601
02:38:54.240 --> 02:39:00.198
I opened an Animal Rescue Centre
in the loving memory of my Charlie.


1602
02:39:01.698 --> 02:39:06.906
Just like Charlie, many homeless souls
are waiting for a loving home.


1603
02:39:07.823 --> 02:39:10.198
You too can become the
Dharmaraya of Kaliyug,


1604
02:39:10.865 --> 02:39:13.073
But... only if you choose to.

1605
02:41:30.490 --> 02:41:31.948
Hey.. Charlie.

1606
02:41:37.656 --> 02:41:41.156
I'll be home soon from work. Take care.

1607
02:42:27.823 --> 02:42:29.990
Your mother was way better than you!
