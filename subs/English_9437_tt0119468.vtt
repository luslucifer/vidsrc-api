00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:44.350
The first time I was in love

4
00:00:44.893 --> 00:00:47.854
was June, 1975, in Boca Raton.

5
00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:51.399
Her name was Coty Pierce.

6
00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:57.446
She lived there with her parents

7
00:00:57.531 --> 00:00:59.866
and her little sister, Karrie.

8
00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:02.118
And I loved her, too.

9
00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:05.621
I loved them both,
and they were in love with me.


10
00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:08.541
They just didn't know it.

11
00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:12.587
No one did.

12
00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:21.304
I lived with them all that June.

I was watching.

16
00:01:29.146 --> 00:01:32.815
I loved the expression on their faces
when they slept.


17
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.738
And then I decided to declare myself

18
00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:41.908
and show them
how much they loved me.


19

20
00:01:46.663 --> 00:01:48.414
Coty was honoured.

21
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:51.584
She kissed me back.

- And then Karrie.

I kissed their mother, too.

often beat you after he drank?

is that to hide bruises?

Smart, talented.

339

Something tells me he ain't choosing
them just for their congeniality.


340

is tied to a tree

Well, think about it, Sikes.

349
00:24:18.305 --> 00:24:20.473
The three you found were killed
out of sequence.


350

you would have found them by now.

no attempt to hide them.

is very revealing.

- Marching to their fate.

The rape, cutting off her hair...

- Maybe for violating some trust.

01:00:17.963 --> 01:00:21.674
I ran a check on all the Sistol orders
over the last five years.


785
01:00:22.926 --> 01:00:24.760
- Guess what?
- What?


786
01:00:25.512 --> 01:00:29.014
A Beverly Hills plastic surgeon
came up on the list.


787
01:00:29.516 --> 01:00:32.435
There's no protocol for Sistol
in plastic surgery.


788
01:00:33.145 --> 01:00:34.353
Bingo.

789
01:00:35.772 --> 01:00:38.441
Two years ago,
this guy ordered enough


790
01:00:38.525 --> 01:00:41.193
to treat leukaemia
in a medium-sized country.


791
01:00:42.195 --> 01:00:45.990
- What's his name?
- Rudolph. William Rudolph.


792
01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:50.161
Grew up in Durham.
Did his premed work here.


793
01:00:53.498 --> 01:00:56.375
Dr Cross, is it him? 
Is he bicoastal?

794
01:00:58.128 --> 01:00:59.712
Bicoastal?

795
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.882
That's an interesting way of putting it.

796
01:01:03.717 --> 01:01:07.303
There are about a dozen predators
operating in California now.


797
01:01:08.472 --> 01:01:11.724
There's one, male Caucasian,
probably early 30s,


798
01:01:12.559 --> 01:01:16.812
he's known as the "Gentleman Caller."
They've been on to him for over a year.


799
01:01:16.897 --> 01:01:19.482
And what I realised last night
was that his abductions,


800
01:01:19.566 --> 01:01:22.818
they followed the ones here
by about 10 days to two weeks.


801
01:01:22.903 --> 01:01:26.739
Matter of fact, it was exactly 10 days
after Naomi disappeared


802
01:01:26.823 --> 01:01:29.700
that a pretty, black coed
disappeared from UCLA.


803
01:01:31.495 --> 01:01:34.079
- So he's doing it there, too.
- Compulsively.


804
01:01:34.331 --> 01:01:38.083
And if he follows true to form,
he's due to hit California pretty quick.


805
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.835
Can the FBI pick him up?

806
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.005
If I get Rudolph to the FBI,
and they make one mistake,


807
01:01:43.173 --> 01:01:45.257
what happens to all these girls?

808
01:01:45.509 --> 01:01:48.844
I can't risk Naomi starving to death
in a cell somewhere.


809
01:01:50.597 --> 01:01:53.516
- No FBI.
- You're going out there on your own.


810
01:01:54.935 --> 01:01:57.728
- I've got people.
- Take me with you.


811
01:01:58.271 --> 01:02:00.356
I think you're best served
by staying here right now.


812
01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.774
And pretend like nothing's happened?

813
01:02:01.858 --> 01:02:03.442
No, no, that's not
what I was gonna say.

814
01:02:03.527 --> 01:02:05.528
- I just think you should return...
- Dr Cross,


815
01:02:05.612 --> 01:02:07.863
I'm the only person who's seen this guy.

816
01:02:07.948 --> 01:02:10.449
I know his size, I know his voice,
I know the way he moves...

819

You think I'm some kind of tourist
in all this because I wasn't raped?


820

I hear those women's voices.

- How's that?
- When he told me that he loved me.

937
01:13:35.384 --> 01:13:36.509
How is he?

938
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:45.352
I'm sorry, Sam. For all this, I'm sorry.

939
01:13:46.395 --> 01:13:48.521
Yes, "shocking" is
an accurate way to describe


940
01:13:48.606 --> 01:13:50.607
what went on here
in the early morning hours.


941
01:13:50.691 --> 01:13:54.569
Local police won't comment,
but Channel 6 sources tell us


942
01:13:54.654 --> 01:13:56.279
that what happened here
in the pre-dawn hours...


943
01:13:56.364 --> 01:13:58.240
- KATE: Does this hurt?
...reaches beyond southern California,


944
01:13:58.324 --> 01:14:00.784
and some say,
involves a rogue branch of the FBI...


945
01:14:00.868 --> 01:14:03.912
They sure can document a fuck-up
at the speed of light.


946
01:14:03.996 --> 01:14:05.080
Here's what we know.

947
01:14:05.164 --> 01:14:06.498
Well, I guarantee
you won't be seeing a picture


948
01:14:06.582 --> 01:14:09.125
of that woman
whose life you saved on TV.


949
01:14:11.545 --> 01:14:14.798
Okay, breathe in. How's this?

950
01:14:15.091 --> 01:14:16.383
Mmm-hmm. (GRUNTS)

951
01:14:17.301 --> 01:14:18.593

Police also found an unidentified...

955
01:14:24.976 --> 01:14:27.310
- We need X-rays.
- Not a chance.


956
01:14:28.187 --> 01:14:31.439
Detective Castillo and the woman were
rushed to a nearby emergency facility


957
01:14:31.524 --> 01:14:32.691
where their condition...

958
01:14:32.775 --> 01:14:34.234
Gone in the night.

959
01:14:35.319 --> 01:14:38.113
At least now the FBI know
who they're looking for.


960
01:14:38.197 --> 01:14:41.283
- How far can he run?
- It's not a question of how far.


961
01:14:42.868 --> 01:14:44.077
It's how long.

962
01:14:44.161 --> 01:14:46.830
...asking lots of questions and receiving
very few answers.


963

Questioned on the scene,
Detective John Sampson,


964
01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:51.793
whom we've learned
is about 3,000 miles


965
01:14:51.877 --> 01:14:53.920
- out of his jurisdiction.
- So, what do you want to do?


966
01:14:54.005 --> 01:14:55.964
Sampson is a detective
in good standing


967
01:14:56.048 --> 01:14:58.008
with the Washington DC
Police Department.


968
01:14:58.092 --> 01:15:00.427
From what local police tell us,
Sampson was part


969
01:15:00.511 --> 01:15:02.470
of a ragtag surveillance team.

970
01:15:02.555 --> 01:15:06.558
Sampson, Detective Castillo and
two other unidentified individuals


971
01:15:06.642 --> 01:15:10.353
were on a stakeout,
but staking out whom or what?


972
01:15:10.688 --> 01:15:13.106
Property records indicate
the cabin owner is Dr William...


973

KATE: Hi, I'd like to see
about making reservations


974
01:15:14.984 --> 01:15:17.485
from Los Angeles to Raleigh-Durham
for two people for tonight.


975
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:20.780
...was Dr Rudolph, a man
with no criminal record to his name...


976
01:15:20.865 --> 01:15:22.324
KATE: Okay, it's the return portion...

977
01:15:22.408 --> 01:15:25.869
- Hang up the phone, Kate.
- Pardon me?


978
01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:28.663
Hang up the phone.

Welcome to our crime scene.

The sight of yellow tape and flashbulbs

981
01:15:41.552 --> 01:15:43.303
must be getting
a little old to you by now.

- You got here quick.


983

- Not quick enough, wouldn't you say?
- Now, wait a minute, Kyle.


984
01:15:48.267 --> 01:15:50.560
- Let's not downplay the upside of this.
- Upside?


985
01:15:50.644 --> 01:15:53.563
Yeah, the upside. We ID'd Casanova.
You got a trail.


986

The day you set foot in Durham...


987
01:15:57.109 --> 01:15:58.860
Look, I feel like you've been
screwing me around.


988
01:15:58.944 --> 01:16:01.029
- Why?
- Look, I let you in.


989
01:16:02.281 --> 01:16:03.823
I shared information.

990
01:16:04.325 --> 01:16:08.328
What have we got? A mess, and a cop
who's looking at two years of rehab.


991
01:16:08.412 --> 01:16:11.122
Kyle, do you want me to say,
"I fucked up"?


992
01:16:12.291 --> 01:16:14.667
All right. I fucked up.

993
01:16:17.004 --> 01:16:19.672
Just don't shut me out of this.

994
01:16:44.198 --> 01:16:45.573
What do you see?

995
01:16:48.953 --> 01:16:51.788
- Maybe I'm looking too hard.
- For what?


996
01:16:52.665 --> 01:16:54.040
I don't know.

997
01:16:56.961 --> 01:16:58.711
It seems so cold.

998
01:16:59.463 --> 01:17:00.672
Not like him.

01:17:05.469 --> 01:17:06.678
Keep looking.

1001
01:17:09.265 --> 01:17:12.100
Thought the closet looked a little tight,
so I brought in a DX fluoroscope.


1002
01:17:12.184 --> 01:17:14.269
It scanned what appeared
to be a lunar module.


1003
01:17:14.353 --> 01:17:15.645
It's a freezer.

He's Don Juan on the east coast,
Josef Mengele on the west.


1007
01:17:24.488 --> 01:17:26.239
- We found feet.
- What?


1008
01:17:26.323 --> 01:17:29.826
You heard me. Surgically band-sawed
at the ankle, vacuum-bagged.


1009
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:31.744
Fifteen pair, two lefts.

1010
01:17:31.829 --> 01:17:34.873
Go figure. Obviously not a dancer.

predator since Jean De Salle, 1921,

And running a bicoastal operation?

Man, this is the most ambitious stunt
in the annals of serial pathology.


1019

This guy is Houdini squared.

1020

Put on brakes, now.
We're not dealing with Houdini here.

There are two of them,

01:18:24.965 --> 01:18:26.758
and they're collaborating.

1026
01:18:27.176 --> 01:18:30.136
Collaborating and competing.

1027
01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.560
Got an ID on him?

1028
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:41.147
He's probably just some kid
Rudolph did 20 years ago.


1029

We'll comb through missing persons.

- Don't bother.

- Mmm-hmm.

01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:02.658
I have fucked nearly

1089
01:23:02.743 --> 01:23:05.328
but I have never hurt any of them.

1090
01:23:05.412 --> 01:23:08.956
There is no record of violence
anywhere in my past.


1091
01:23:15.214 --> 01:23:16.506
Mmm-hmm.

1092
01:23:18.217 --> 01:23:19.467
Megan Murphy.

1093
01:23:21.929 --> 01:23:26.766
Oh, yeah. This is
a painstaking recreation of an image


1094
01:23:26.850 --> 01:23:31.103
from Friedrich Thelen's Die Welt
der Flagellanten. Do you know it?


1095
01:23:33.315 --> 01:23:35.483
That took me three hours
to tie her up properly.


1096
01:23:35.567 --> 01:23:37.819
And consensually, by the way.

1097
01:23:39.029 --> 01:23:42.031
Dr Cross, tell me
you've got more than this.


1098
01:23:43.033 --> 01:23:45.701
I have pictures of
Megan tied to a tree.

1099
01:23:46.954 --> 01:23:52.583
No. I was thinking we'd discuss that
at the trial in, say, six months?


1100
01:23:54.461 --> 01:23:58.548
But maybe you would like me to go on
record now about Naomi.


1101
01:24:01.885 --> 01:24:06.055
Let's start with the first time I saw her.
In my office.


1102
01:24:06.139 --> 01:24:09.225
She was wearing a silk blouse,
which pleases me


1103
01:24:09.309 --> 01:24:12.395
because I like to turn up
the air conditioning


1104
01:24:12.604 --> 01:24:18.317
to constrict the capillaries.
You know, tweak the nipples.


1105
01:24:18.402 --> 01:24:20.695
You should have seen
how self-conscious she was.


1106
01:24:20.779 --> 01:24:25.157
How nervous the chill
in the air made her.


1107
01:24:25.242 --> 01:24:28.286
And like the others, her manner
belied her real predilections.


1108
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:33.457
Which reminds me, Doctor, have you
seen the photographs of Naomi?


1109
01:24:35.878 --> 01:24:38.337
KYLE: Alex! Alex!

1110
01:24:41.049 --> 01:24:43.718
Back up! Back up! Move! Move!

1111

Put your hands down! All right.

Everything's all right.

his mouth on my ear.

I take it we didn't get our confession.

We didn't. He's not Casanova.

1127
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:56.832
His picture was on the wall.

1128
01:25:57.125 --> 01:25:59.669
- ALEX: That's part of their thing.
- But his picture.


1129

Kate, it's a setup.

Wick Sachs is the perfect patsy
for them.


1132
01:26:06.009 --> 01:26:09.053
He's too smug and too vain
to even know what hit him.


1133
01:26:09.137 --> 01:26:11.472
He's just a bush-league letch.

1134

The cops think they got the right guy.

1135
01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.354
- I've been listening to the tape.
- Yeah?


1136
01:26:18.438 --> 01:26:22.233
Have you ever heard
a foetal sonogram? An ultrasound?


1137
01:26:22.317 --> 01:26:24.777
You know, on the tape,
you asked me if I heard anything.


1138
01:26:24.861 --> 01:26:26.821
Yeah. You said, "Nothing."

1139
01:26:26.905 --> 01:26:28.906
That's not true.

1140
01:26:28.991 --> 01:26:32.118
I heard something.
It was in the background.


1141
01:26:32.202 --> 01:26:33.953
It was constant.

1142
01:26:34.037 --> 01:26:36.706
- I heard water.
- Water?


1143
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:40.042
Everywhere. Below me, above,
around, everywhere.


1144
01:26:41.211 --> 01:26:43.754
I had to have been in a basement.

1145
01:26:43.839 --> 01:26:45.798
Not possible.

- The FBI have checked everything...
- They missed it.


1148
01:26:51.513 --> 01:26:54.765
Kate, I saw the aerial photographs.
They didn't miss an inch.


1149
01:26:54.850 --> 01:26:57.184
There were doors, there were walls,

1150
01:26:57.269 --> 01:26:58.519
there were stairs.

1151
01:26:58.603 --> 01:26:59.812
It was man-made. It was built.

1152
01:26:59.896 --> 01:27:02.732
When you escaped,
you had no recollection of a house.


1153

You said there was light. That's it.
"Suddenly there was light."


1154
01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.572
And I had been in a house, Alex.
I am sure of it.


1155
01:27:11.116 --> 01:27:14.368
Okay. Here's what we're looking for,
a plantation layout.


1156
01:27:14.453 --> 01:27:16.912
So now, there weren't plantations
on the Wykagyl.


1157
01:27:16.997 --> 01:27:19.790
- There was a plantation.
- What?


1158
01:27:19.875 --> 01:27:22.084
Check it out.
All this is Mason's property.


1159
01:27:22.169 --> 01:27:24.211
All right, now, this is hundreds of acres.

1160
01:27:24.296 --> 01:27:29.425
Here's the big house, slave quarters,
stables, cellars for stashing food, ice,

- tunnels everywhere.
- Can I see this?

- The river runs right through it.
- Where was I found?

Around here.
Two miles down from the big house.

01:48:59.798 --> 01:49:02.383
I want you to think about this, Nick.

1388
01:49:02.468 --> 01:49:05.011
If you do this,
no one will ever understand.


1389
01:49:05.095 --> 01:49:08.514
- Oh, don't mindfuck me!
- No, no, I'm not, Nick. I'm not.


1390
01:49:08.599 --> 01:49:09.724
(SHUDDERING)

1391
01:49:12.436 --> 01:49:13.936
NICK: You see, Kate?

1392
01:49:14.063 --> 01:49:16.147
It's all about building rapport.

1393
01:49:18.442 --> 01:49:20.985
You use the subject's first name.

1394
01:49:21.111 --> 01:49:23.946
And your tone.
You've got to keep it soft


1395
01:49:24.948 --> 01:49:26.324
and steady.

1396
01:49:27.409 --> 01:49:32.497
- Establish eye contact. Seek his level.
- You want to know the truth, Alex?


1397
01:49:33.123 --> 01:49:36.793
- You're the one who really needs help.
- Well, enlighten me, Nick.


1398
01:49:37.961 --> 01:49:39.545
Tell me what truth is.

1399
01:49:39.630 --> 01:49:43.466
Truth is looking at a beautiful woman
like our Kate here,


1400
01:49:44.676 --> 01:49:48.179
and saying to yourself,
"I've got to have that.


1401
01:49:48.931 --> 01:49:52.975
"I've got to break her down."

1402
01:49:54.603 --> 01:49:58.523
It's your basest animal self.

1403
01:49:59.650 --> 01:50:03.027
Dig deep, Alex. 
You'll recognise him.

1404
01:50:04.863 --> 01:50:06.364
He's ugly.

1405
01:50:07.908 --> 01:50:10.326
I've run into him now and then.

1406
01:50:11.703 --> 01:50:12.745
Go ahead.

1407
01:50:13.497 --> 01:50:16.958
Reach for the Glock and take me down
before I tell you about the 10 days


1408
01:50:17.042 --> 01:50:18.835
I spent with Naomi.

1409
01:50:19.670 --> 01:50:23.172
Ten days, Doc.
Things she'd never tell you.


1410
01:50:23.715 --> 01:50:27.009
My brown sugar. 
Face like an angel.

1411
01:50:27.845 --> 01:50:31.347
Perfect. Every inch of her.

1412
01:50:32.766 --> 01:50:37.186
You never knew Naomi. 
Not like I did.

1413
01:50:38.564 --> 01:50:42.024
Deep down, you envy me that.

1414
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:45.403
Say it.

1415
01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:48.364
I don't work like you.

1416
01:50:49.867 --> 01:50:52.201
I don't hate.

1417
01:50:53.745 --> 01:50:56.456
You only wish you had the courage.

1418
01:50:59.918 --> 01:51:03.463
Good night, sweet Kate.

1419
01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:11.804
(KATE SCREAMING)

1420
01:51:31.992 --> 01:51:33.075
Kate.

1421
01:51:33.827 --> 01:51:35.745
It's all right, Kate.
