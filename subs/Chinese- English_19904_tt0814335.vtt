00:05:08.222 --> 00:05:09.770
一名35岁至40岁的女性
One female in her late thirties


2
00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:10.724
和3名未成年人

3
00:05:10.808 --> 00:05:13.518
多处刺伤及钝器击伤
Multiple stab wounds and blunt-force trauma.


4
00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:14.792
她前夫有嫌疑吗
What about the ex-husband?


5
00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:17.356
法院说他太太申请了对他的限制令
Court said the wife had a restraining order against him.


6
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.174
狄伦·伯奈特  他那天晚上
Dylan Bennet. He spent the night


7
00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:20.817
喝了瓶杰克·丹尼
with a bottle of Jack Daniel's.


8
00:05:20.902 --> 00:05:22.744
那是他离婚后的第一个圣诞
It was his first Christmas without his family.


9
00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:23.737
还有其他证据吗
All the more reason.


10
00:05:23.821 --> 00:05:25.697
你是没看到他来认领家人时的样子
Well, you didn't see him when he id-ed his family.


11
00:05:25.782 --> 00:05:27.491
像被货车碾过一样
Looked like he'd been hit by a freight train.


12
00:05:27.575 --> 00:05:29.566
看到他的孩子这个样  到处是血
Seeing his kids like that. All the blood.


13
00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:31.703
对他而言绝对是恶梦
Yeah, it was definitely a nightmare for him.


14
00:05:31.788 --> 00:05:33.534
要真是他干的
If this guy did it,


15
00:05:33.535 --> 00:05:35.499
他都能获奥斯卡奖了
he gets my vote for a goddamn Academy Award.


16
00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:36.631
我们假设是他们的继父
Let's say the stepfather,


17
00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:38.251
格雷迪·爱德华干的
this Grady Edwards did it.


18
00:05:38.336 --> 00:05:40.170
-我们知道他什么  -什么都不知道
- What do we got on him? - Nothing.


19
00:05:40.254 --> 00:05:41.463
听说他是从堪萨斯州来的
Said he was from Kansas.


20
00:05:41.547 --> 00:05:43.548
但我们在数据库里找不到匹配的人
Except we can't find a match in any database.


21
00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:45.926
而且他停订了报纸  这让他有时间人间蒸发
And he stopped the newspaper to have time to disappear.


22
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.220
我们觉得他以前可能做过同样的案子
And we think he might have done this before.


23
00:05:48.304 --> 00:05:50.277
3年前  在新泽西
Three years ago in New Jersey,


24
00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:51.264
一个妻子和3个孩子

25
00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.492
后脑枪伤
Gunshot wounds to the back of the head.


26
00:05:53.493 --> 00:05:54.976
继父同样人间蒸发
The stepfather disappeared.


27
00:05:55.353 --> 00:05:57.354
他遇到被害人的时候都在租房子住
Lived in a rented room where he met the victims.


28
00:05:57.438 --> 00:05:59.606
两个房东都是老妇女
Both rooms were owned by older women.


29
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.608
其中在新泽西的那个女人说
One of the women who lives in New Jersey said,


30
00:06:01.692 --> 00:06:02.835
"他是个很好的人"
"He's a wonderful man,"


31
00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:05.070
"总是及时用现金付租金"
"always paid his rent on time and in cash."


32
00:06:05.154 --> 00:06:07.489
顺理成章的  她从来没要过他的证件
So, of course, she never asked him for any identification.


33
00:06:07.573 --> 00:06:09.203
不  他很聪明  想想我们发现
No, he's smart. The Toyota land cruiser


34
00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:10.617
他丢弃的那辆丰田陆地巡洋舰
that we found abandoned?


35
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:12.240
现金付款
Paid for in cash.


36
00:06:12.241 --> 00:06:14.037
不要求登记驾照
No driver's license required for registration.


37
00:06:14.122 --> 00:06:16.790
没有信用卡  什么都没有  也就是说...
No credit cards, no anything. Which means...


38
00:06:16.874 --> 00:06:18.861
不需要带照片的证件
No photo id required.


39
00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:20.669
永远是离婚或鳏夫身份
Always a divorced or widowed situation.


40
00:06:20.753 --> 00:06:23.463
这家伙是个魔鬼
I'm telling you, this guy's a monster.


41
00:06:27.385 --> 00:06:29.010
就算你说的这人是凶手
Even if this is your guy,


42
00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:30.516
那也过了半年了
it's been six months.


43
00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:32.222
他现在可能在任何一个地方
He could be anywhere by now.


44
00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:44.234
妈妈  贝斯说我们不能拿这些
Mom, Beth says I can't get these.


45
00:06:44.318 --> 00:06:45.327
肖恩  我们不要这些
Sean, we're not getting these.


46
00:06:45.328 --> 00:06:46.027
你们俩不许吵了
Hey! You two stop arguing.


47
00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:47.136
为什么每次都是她来挑
Why does she always get to


48
00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:48.989
我们的饼干  这不公平
pick the kind of cookies we get? It's not fair!


49
00:06:49.073 --> 00:06:50.508
生活就是不公平的  生活就是
Life is not fair. Life is


50
00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:53.034
得由女人来挑饼干
about the woman getting to pick the cookies.


51
00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:56.371
不好意思  他们有时候不太听话
Sorry, they get a little out of control sometimes.


52
00:06:56.456 --> 00:06:58.331
小孩子嘛
They're just kids.


53
00:06:58.416 --> 00:07:00.457
不过你越快明白这个饼干的问题
But the sooner you figure out the cookie deal,


54
00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:01.877
你的生活就会越轻松
the easier your life's gonna be.


55
00:07:01.961 --> 00:07:03.378
我只是说说而已
I'm just saying.


56
00:07:03.463 --> 00:07:06.882
这是女人的世界  我们只是来做客的
It's a woman's world and we're just guests here.


57
00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:09.384
聪明人  看来你妻子很幸运
Wise man. I'd say your wife is very lucky.


58
00:07:10.928 --> 00:07:12.471
我已经没妻子了
I'm not married anymore.


59
00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:14.236
我还戴着它  但是去年在一场车祸中
I still wear it, but I lost


60
00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:17.100
我的妻子和女儿都去世了
my wife and daughter in an accident last year.


61
00:07:17.185 --> 00:07:20.103
-酒后驾驶  -天啊  真抱歉
- Drunk driver. - God, I'm so sorry.


62
00:07:20.188 --> 00:07:21.271
没事
It's okay.


63
00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:25.192
-能帮个忙吗  -当然
- I could use a little help, though. - Sure.


64
00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:26.610
花生酱在哪儿
Where is the peanut butter?


65
00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:30.030
我刚搬来波特兰  还不太熟悉这家店
I just moved to Portland and I don't know this store yet.


66
00:07:31.282 --> 00:07:34.868
-往那边两列货架  -那边?  谢谢
- It's actually two aisles over. - This way? Thank you.


67
00:07:34.952 --> 00:07:36.369
不用客气
You're so welcome.


68
00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:38.663
记得我跟你说的话哦
Remember what I told you.


69
00:07:45.922 --> 00:07:47.005
怎么了
What?


70
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:13.051
如果我不知道的话
If I didn't know better,


71
00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:14.449
我一定会以为你在跟踪我
I'd think you were following me.


72
00:08:19.705 --> 00:08:22.264
我通常没这么开放
I'm not usually this forward,


73
00:08:22.265 --> 00:08:25.335
但我最近离了婚  而且...
but I'm recently divorced and...


74
00:08:27.797 --> 00:08:29.128
我正要带孩子们去吃批萨
I'm taking my kids for pizza,


75
00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:30.966
你要不要一起去
so I thought maybe you might want to go.


76
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.050
-批萨?  -实际上是我
- Pizza? - The truth is,


77
00:08:32.134 --> 00:08:34.719
太想跟成年人聊聊天了
I'm just dying for some adult conversation.


78
00:08:34.804 --> 00:08:36.763
我通常不是这样轻浮的
Well, I'm not usually this easy.


79
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.349
大卫·哈里斯
David Harris.


80
00:08:40.017 --> 00:08:42.185
苏珊  苏珊·哈丁

81
00:08:42.436 --> 00:08:45.438
-很高兴认识你  -我也是
- It's very nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.


82
00:08:46.438 --> 00:08:48.438
半年后

83
00:08:58.828 --> 00:09:00.495
我还是不相信她没来机场
I still can't believe she didn't come to the airport.


84
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.247
我跟你说了  她有事
I told you, she had some things to do.


85
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.168
-帮帮忙  -好的
- A little help here. - Yeah.


86
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.716
至少还有我啊
At least you have me.


87
00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.346
你看到过那个家伙吗
So, have you met this guy?


88
00:09:18.431 --> 00:09:19.928
看到过  我来看你妈妈的时候
Yeah, a couple of times. You know,


89
00:09:19.929 --> 00:09:21.558
遇到过他几次
when I came by to say hi to your Mom.


90
00:09:21.642 --> 00:09:22.345
他挺好的
He seems cool.


91
00:09:22.346 --> 00:09:23.852
但她貌似圣诞节之后才认识他的吧
Okay, but she's only known him since,


92
00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:26.109
这也太快了
What, like, after Christmas? That's so fast.


93
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.430
得了  给他个机会
Well...Come on, give it a chance.


94
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:30.650
不要做傻事
You know? Before you do something stupid.


95
00:09:30.735 --> 00:09:33.945
-什么傻事  -我也不知道
- Like what? - I don't know. Like,


96
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.049
比如惹你老妈生气
irritating your Mom


97
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.323
让她把你送回军事学校
and getting sent back to military school.


98
00:09:36.407 --> 00:09:37.906
我只是说她这事做得太着急了
I'm just saying, it seems


99
00:09:37.907 --> 00:09:40.785
你不觉得吗
like she's rushing into things. Don't you think?


100
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.326
我觉得怎么安排她的生活
I think it's her business


101
00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:43.121
是她自己的事
what she does with her personal life.


102
00:09:43.205 --> 00:09:44.998
而她最大的可能就是毁掉它
And she tends to screw that up, mostly.


103
00:09:45.082 --> 00:09:47.046
得啦  迈克尔  振作一点
Come on, Michael, chill on this one,


104
00:09:47.047 --> 00:09:48.793
求你了  别跟你妈妈吵架了

105
00:09:48.878 --> 00:09:51.046
-好吧  -好的  我有样东西给你看
- Okay. - Okay. I got something to show you.


106

110
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:07.347
肖恩  天啊

113
00:10:10.733 --> 00:10:12.567
贝斯  我也想你

-莉亚  -亲爱的

116
00:10:16.947 --> 00:10:19.949
让我看看  你头发长长了
Let me look at you. Your hair's gotten longer.


117
00:10:20.034 --> 00:10:21.969
是的  一年后他们就会要求剪短
Yeah. They ease up on you after a year.


118
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.275
你看上去真像大人
You look so...so much like a man.


119
00:10:24.276 --> 00:10:26.581
我还以为是小男孩呢
I was expecting a boy.


120
00:10:27.249 --> 00:10:29.523
这就是部队的作用
That's what the military does.


121
00:10:29.524 --> 00:10:32.253
打造男人  强壮的好男人
Builds men. Good, strong men.


122
00:10:32.338 --> 00:10:33.495
迈克尔  这是大卫
Michael, this is David.


123
00:10:33.496 --> 00:10:34.589
大卫  这是迈克尔
David, Michael.


124
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:41.304
-这是标准发型吗  -不
- Is that a regulation cut? - No.


125
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:42.709
它并不是真正的军队
It wasn't real military.


126
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.765
只是个差生学校
It was just a school for screwups.


127
00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:47.081
很高兴终于见到你了

一切好像都很好
Everything seems to be going great.


130
00:11:01.784 --> 00:11:03.461
肖恩和贝斯爱他
Sean and Beth love him.


131
00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:04.494
怎么会不爱呢
What's not to love?


132
00:11:04.578 --> 00:11:05.909
他好得不像是真的
Yeah, he's almost too good to be true.


133
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.039
别提这个话题  杰姬
Don't start, Jackie.


134
00:11:08.124 --> 00:11:10.667
我开玩笑的  开玩笑的  我喜欢他
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I like him.


135
00:11:11.043 --> 00:11:12.315
你觉不觉得我跟一个才认识半年的
Do you think I'm crazy to be


136
00:11:12.316 --> 00:11:14.587
男人订婚太疯狂了?
engaged to someone I've only known for six months?


137
00:11:14.672 --> 00:11:17.298
你一直都很疯狂  跟他没关系
You've always been crazy. That has nothing to do with him.


138
00:11:18.092 --> 00:11:20.885
他貌似也有点疯狂  为你而狂
He seems a little crazy, too, about you.


139
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.388
-大家都吃饱了吗  -饱了...
- Everyone have enough to eat? - Yeah...


140
00:11:23.472 --> 00:11:27.308
我想来个求婚致词
I would like to propose a toast.


141
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:31.730
首先  我想谢谢苏珊  肖恩和贝斯
First of all, I want to thank Susan and Sean and Beth,


142
00:11:31.814 --> 00:11:33.567
他们在很短的时间接纳了我
Who, in a very short time,


143
00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:36.401
让我有家的感觉
have taken me in and made me feel at home.


144
00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:39.863
这个...这对我来说真是美梦成真
This is...it's a dream come true for me.


145
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.323
谢谢
Thank you.


146
00:11:42.408 --> 00:11:44.935
也谢谢迈克尔
And to Michael.


147
00:11:44.936 --> 00:11:46.620
你回来让家完整了
Your return makes us complete.


148
00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:50.468
家是最重要的东西
Family is the most important thing.


149
00:11:50.469 --> 00:11:52.584
没有它  我们就一无所有
Without it, we have nothing.


150
00:11:52.877 --> 00:11:55.211
-欢迎回来  迈克尔  -好啊  好啊
- Welcome home, Michael. - Hear, hear.


151
00:11:55.504 --> 00:11:57.422
好啊  好啊  迈克尔
Hear, hear, Michael.


152
00:11:57.506 --> 00:12:00.008
这下子搞得我想吐了
I think I'm a little nauseous after that.


153
00:12:00.176 --> 00:12:01.426
别这样
Stop it.


154
00:12:02.928 --> 00:12:04.122
你想要点喝的吗
You want something to drink?


155
00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:05.847
不  不用  我有这个
No, no, no, I got this.


156
00:12:06.348 --> 00:12:08.600
我们也有一个惊喜要给你
We have a surprise for you, too.


157
00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:10.769
-真的吗  -杰姬托了些关系
- Really? - Jackie pulled a few strings


158
00:12:10.853 --> 00:12:12.168
她替你找了份工作
and she can get you a job


159
00:12:12.169 --> 00:12:14.272
跟她一起做房产中介
working with her as a real estate agent.


160
00:12:14.356 --> 00:12:17.442
-我不行  -等一下  你当然行
- I couldn't. - Wait a minute. Of course you can.


161
00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:20.278
行吧?  你跟着我  我会带你上手的
Okay? Just follow me around and I'll get you all set up.


162
00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:21.423
这可是我们的好机会
It's a great opportunity


163
00:12:21.424 --> 00:12:23.281
她竭尽全力才办到的
for us and she really went out of her way.


164
00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:25.947
我总不能对我未来的新娘
Well, I can't say no to my bride-to-be


165
00:12:25.948 --> 00:12:28.161
或者她姐姐说不  是吧
or her sister, can I?


166
00:12:28.245 --> 00:12:29.438
谢谢你  杰姬
Thank you, Jackie.


167
00:12:29.439 --> 00:12:30.205
别谢我  谢她
Don't thank me. Thank her.


168
00:12:30.289 --> 00:12:31.261
是她说服我
Because she's the one who convinced me


169
00:12:31.262 --> 00:12:32.624
让我带你入行的
to get you off the road


170
00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:36.002
-这样她可以监视着你  -是吗
- So she can keep an eye on you. - Did you?


171
00:12:39.965 --> 00:12:43.259
谢谢  我去跟你儿子聊聊
Thank you. I'm gonna go have a word with your son.


172
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.888
天啊  我希望迈克尔能接纳他
God, I hope Michael takes to him.


173
00:12:46.972 --> 00:12:50.975
他会的  他只是被离婚搞懵了
He will. He's just been blindsided by the divorce.


174
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.560
他会缓过气来的
He'll bounce back.


175
00:12:52.895 --> 00:12:55.216
迈克尔  给我几分钟
Michael. Give me four minutes.


176
00:12:55.217 --> 00:12:56.523
我们在地下室里面见
Meet me in the basement.


177
00:13:00.152 --> 00:13:03.404
他说什么
So, what'd he say?


178
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:05.740
他让我去地下室找他
He said he wants me to meet him in the basement.


179
00:13:05.825 --> 00:13:07.742
-地下室?  -是的
- In the basement? - Yeah.


180
00:13:08.536 --> 00:13:09.577
为什么
Why?


181
00:13:09.662 --> 00:13:11.788
不知道  我要去找找原因了
I don't know. Well, I guess I'm about to find out.


182
00:13:51.203 --> 00:13:54.789
那两个是我的  不过其他的你随便用
Those two are mine. But you're welcome to use the others.


183
00:13:56.292 --> 00:13:57.792
这些是用来做什么的
What's all this for?


184
00:13:57.877 --> 00:14:01.087
我自封为木匠
Well, I'm a bit of a wannabe carpenter.


185
00:14:01.171 --> 00:14:03.256
我自己打造了这些储物柜
I built these storage cabinets myself.


186
00:14:03.716 --> 00:14:05.805
我现在正在修补阁楼
And I'm working up in the attic


187
00:14:05.806 --> 00:14:07.135
那里损坏真严重
right now on some termite damage.


188
00:14:07.928 --> 00:14:10.179
我想我们需要一个真正的致词
I think we need a real toast.


189
00:14:10.264 --> 00:14:11.890
男人之间的谈话
Just the guys.


190
00:14:12.683 --> 00:14:15.310
这地方我专门用来藏好东西
This is where I keep the good stuff.


191
00:14:18.606 --> 00:14:20.148
来了
There we go.


192
00:14:20.941 --> 00:14:24.068
别让你妈妈知道我有个藏酒的柜子
Now, don't let your Mom know I've got a tequila stash.


193
00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:28.364
我拼了老命才让她相信我很完美
I've worked my ass off trying to convince her I'm perfect.


194
00:14:28.449 --> 00:14:30.372
我知道这很让人震惊
I know this must be a bit of a shock,


195
00:14:30.373 --> 00:14:32.452
你妈妈和我要结婚了
your Mom and me getting married and all,


196
00:14:33.704 --> 00:14:36.581
但是我希望你明白  我希望我们
but I want you to know, I want us


197
00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:39.000
能真正成为一个家庭
to be a real family.


198
00:14:39.668 --> 00:14:41.544
因为没有它  我们就一无所有?
Because without it, we have nothing?


199
00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:45.340
是的  一语中的
Okay. Touch.


200
00:14:45.883 --> 00:14:47.622
我有时候有些老套
So I get a little corny sometimes,


201
00:14:47.623 --> 00:14:48.927
但我是认真的
but I meant what I said.


202
00:14:49.011 --> 00:14:51.054
你让我来应付你妈妈
You just let me handle your mother,


203
00:14:51.138 --> 00:14:53.111
我肯定能让你留在这里
and I'm gonna make sure you stay right here,


204
00:14:53.112 --> 00:14:54.098
你属于这里
where you belong.


205
00:14:54.183 --> 00:14:56.559
不再让你去军校了
No more military school.


206
00:14:56.644 --> 00:14:59.646
我们得把这个家庭重组起来  你跟我
We're gonna put this family back together, you and me,


207
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.190
-父亲和儿子  -是继父
- Father and son. - Stepfather.


208
00:15:03.192 --> 00:15:04.525
继父
Stepfather


209
00:15:05.736 --> 00:15:07.070
和儿子
And son.


210
00:15:10.991 --> 00:15:12.700
口感滑腻  是吧
That's smooth, isn't it?


211
00:15:15.496 --> 00:15:17.747
你妈妈告诉我  你是个游泳健将
So your mother tells me you're one hell of a swimmer.


212
00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:19.207
是的  我游得不错
Yeah, I do okay.


213
00:15:19.291 --> 00:15:21.397
我以前参加过游泳比赛
You know, I used to swim in competition.


214
00:15:21.398 --> 00:15:23.294
在俄勒冈大学
In college, at U of O.


215
00:15:23.379 --> 00:15:26.047
第二年很重要
Your senior year is gonna be very important.


216
00:15:26.131 --> 00:15:28.466
或许你能拿到哪个学校的游泳奖学金呢
You could maybe get a college scholarship swimming.


217
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.842
今年夏天你应该训练
You should be training this summer.


218
00:15:29.927 --> 00:15:31.594
在后院的那个池子里面可很难训练起来
It's kind of hard to train in a backyard pool.


219
00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:33.456
也许吧  但我听说你以前学校
Maybe. But I hear your old school


220
00:15:33.457 --> 00:15:34.472
里面有个夏泳项目
has a summer swim program.


221
00:15:34.556 --> 00:15:38.059
是的  但我已经不能再去那里游了
It does, but I can't use that pool anymore.


222
00:15:39.228 --> 00:15:40.687
那都过去了
That's the past.


223
00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:44.899
这一杯敬将来
Here is to the future.


224
00:15:47.987 --> 00:15:49.821
记得吗  我明天得去看我爷爷奶奶
Remember, I have to go see my grandparents tomorrow.


225
00:15:49.905 --> 00:15:50.794
是的
Yeah, that's right.


226
00:15:50.795 --> 00:15:52.657
我后天回来  真抱歉
But I'll be back the day after. I'm sorry.


227
00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:54.968
不  没关系  虽然我才回来
No, that's all right. I mean, it's the day I get back,


228
00:15:54.969 --> 00:15:56.619
但没关系  我会叫其他人来
But that's fine. I'll call someone else.


229
00:15:56.704 --> 00:15:58.705
闭嘴  我很抱歉
Shut up. I'm sorry.


230
00:15:59.164 --> 00:16:01.040
听着  我想拿到驾照
Listen, I want to get my license.


231
00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:04.419
你能带我去车管局吗
So, can you take me by the DMV?


232
00:16:04.753 --> 00:16:08.589
-也许吧  我考虑一下  -干吗不愿意
- Maybe. I'll think about it. - Why not?


233
00:16:08.924 --> 00:16:11.384
实际上我有些喜欢你依赖我
I kind of like having you dependent on me, actually.


234
00:16:11.468 --> 00:16:12.635
行啊  上车吧
All right, get in the car.


235
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.929
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.


236
00:16:15.556 --> 00:16:17.515
-晚安  莉亚  -再见
- Good night, Leah. - Bye.


237
00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:22.437
很高兴你回来  迈克尔
Glad you're home, Michael.


238
00:16:22.688 --> 00:16:23.958
谢谢  杰姬阿姨
Thanks, Aunt Jackie.


239
00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:26.816
我很高兴回家了  谢谢你过来
I'm so glad to be home. Thank you for coming.


240
00:16:38.912 --> 00:16:40.025
你觉得大卫说他会让你妈妈
Do you think David meant what


241
00:16:40.026 --> 00:16:41.831
让你留下来  是当真的吗
he said about getting your Mom to let you stay?


242
00:16:41.915 --> 00:16:45.209
他说他会做到的  我们到时候看吧
He said he was gonna make it happen, so we'll see.


243
00:16:45.502 --> 00:16:47.628
再见  亲爱的
Sweet. Bye.


244
00:16:51.258 --> 00:16:52.967
很辛苦的一天吧
A lot for one day, huh?


245
00:16:53.052 --> 00:16:55.970
不  不...很好  谢谢
No, no, it was...it was nice. Thanks.


246
00:16:56.305 --> 00:16:58.556
我努力过头了  你可以这样说
I'm trying too hard. You can say it.


247
00:17:03.854 --> 00:17:05.417
迈克尔  我知道对你来说
Look, Michael, I know it's


248
00:17:05.418 --> 00:17:08.483
家里有其他男人会很不爽
difficult to come home to another man in the house.


249
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.361
但我需要你试着与他相处  好吗
I just need you to try and get along, okay?


250
00:17:12.446 --> 00:17:14.457
妈妈  以后再说教好吗
Mom, can we just hold the lectures,


251
00:17:14.458 --> 00:17:16.699
求你了  我才刚到家
please? I've been home for two seconds.


252
00:17:18.327 --> 00:17:19.744
好的
Okay.


253
00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.497
他真的是个好人
He's a really good guy.


254
00:17:22.956 --> 00:17:24.014
他很关心我
And he cares about me and


255
00:17:24.015 --> 00:17:25.792
我们正努力开始我们的新生活
we're trying to start a new life together.


256
00:17:25.876 --> 00:17:27.393
而你不希望我把这个搞砸掉
And you don't want me to mess that up.


257
00:17:27.394 --> 00:17:28.044
这不公平
Well, that's not fair.


258
00:17:28.128 --> 00:17:29.033
不  不  不  我明白
No, no, no, I get it. I'll


259
00:17:29.034 --> 00:17:30.671
我会尽量为你和你的新生活打开方便之门
try not to inconvenience you and your new life.


260
00:17:30.756 --> 00:17:32.882
-迈克尔  -对不起  我...
- Michael. - I'm sorry. I...


261
00:17:33.801 --> 00:17:35.343
我太累了  妈妈
I'm pretty tired, Mom.


262
00:17:37.471 --> 00:17:39.013
好的  好的
Okay. Okay.


263
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:42.225
晚安
Good night.


264
00:17:48.315 --> 00:17:50.358
或许他该在那里读二年级
Maybe he should stay there his senior year.


265
00:17:50.442 --> 00:17:52.685
但他应该跟他的家人一起待在这里
But his place is here with his family.


266
00:17:52.686 --> 00:17:55.154
是的  可是你不知道他是怎么样的
Yeah, but you don't know what he was like.


267
00:17:55.239 --> 00:17:57.302
他跟什么样的孩子一起出去鬼混
The kids he was hanging out with,


268
00:17:57.303 --> 00:17:59.867
他撒谎  情绪失控
the lying. His temper was out of control.


269
00:18:03.872 --> 00:18:05.841
相信我  我希望他能待在这里
Believe me, I want him here


270
00:18:05.842 --> 00:18:06.457
比什么都想
more than anything in the world.


271
00:18:06.542 --> 00:18:09.544
我只希望他做好了准备
I just hope he's ready.


272
00:18:12.923 --> 00:18:14.257
你说得对
You're right.


273
00:18:19.513 --> 00:18:21.597
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?


274
00:18:21.682 --> 00:18:23.391
那得看情况了
Well, it depends.


275
00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:26.018
你准备好这个了吗
Are you ready for it?


276
00:19:03.056 --> 00:19:05.516
好香啊
That smells good.


277
00:19:05.601 --> 00:19:08.530
-工作怎么样  -工作很好
- How was work? - Work was great.


278
00:19:08.531 --> 00:19:11.247
-这个给你  -谢谢
- These are for you. - Thank you.


279
00:19:11.248 --> 00:19:13.149
迈克尔
Michael.


280
00:19:13.942 --> 00:19:15.985
-这是什么  -你原来学校更衣室
- What's this? - Your locker key to the boys' gym


281
00:19:16.069 --> 00:19:17.570
储物柜的钥匙
at your old high school.


282
00:19:17.654 --> 00:19:21.741
游泳队6月的第一个星期开始训练
The swim team starts training first week in July.


283
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:25.620
等一下  你怎么搞到这个的
Wait, how did you swing this?


284
00:19:25.704 --> 00:19:27.226
我跟运动主管瑞弗太太
I had a little chat with Mrs. Rivers,


285
00:19:27.227 --> 00:19:28.206
谈了一下  她真是
the athletic director,


286
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.498
个心胸开阔的女人
A very open-minded woman.


287
00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:31.083
大卫  你太好了
David, that was so sweet.


288
00:19:31.168 --> 00:19:33.252
真的  这真难以置信
Yeah, that's incredible.


289
00:19:33.337 --> 00:19:35.880
目前为止还只是个试用期
It's just a probationary period for now.


290
00:19:35.964 --> 00:19:37.571
这可不保证他们明年秋天会
There's no guarantee they'll let


291
00:19:37.572 --> 00:19:40.134
让你回来  但我们以后再说这个
you back in the fall. But we'll work on that later.


292
00:19:41.803 --> 00:19:44.282
这对我意义太重大了  太谢谢你了
It means a lot. Thank you so much.


293
00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:44.805
不客气
You're welcome.


294
00:19:45.724 --> 00:19:47.183
我们吃什么呢
So, what are we having here?


295
00:19:47.267 --> 00:19:48.815
我觉得好酷啊
Okay, I just think it's so cool


296
00:19:48.816 --> 00:19:51.312
他真的做到了他要做的事情
that he actually did what he said he was gonna do.


297
00:19:51.396 --> 00:19:52.855
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.


298
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.024
看吧  我说所有的事都会解决的
See, I told you everything was gonna work out.


299
00:19:55.108 --> 00:19:56.859
是的  也许你是对的
Yeah, maybe you're right.


300
00:19:56.944 --> 00:19:59.263
我们明天还是要去车管局吧
Hey, we still going to the DMV tomorrow?


301
00:19:59.264 --> 00:20:01.030
好  我大约10点左右到
Yeah. I'll be by around 10:00.


302
00:20:01.448 --> 00:20:03.074
-行  听上去很不错  -好的
- Yeah, that sounds good. - All right.


303
00:20:03.158 --> 00:20:04.325
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Night.


304
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.423
肖恩  请把声音开小点
Hey, Sean, turn that down, please!


305
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.010
好的
Yes!


306
00:20:23.262 --> 00:20:25.846
肖恩  把声音开小  我是认真的
Sean, turn that down now! I mean it!


307
00:20:28.225 --> 00:20:30.685
你妈妈说把声音开小点
Your mother said to turn it down!


308
00:20:55.377 --> 00:20:57.582
你觉得他们这个年纪
Do you think it's a good idea


309
00:20:57.583 --> 00:20:59.297
就这样亲热好吗
they're so passionate at their age?


310
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:01.716
他们小学就认识了
They've known each other since grade school.


311
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.343
她对迈克尔有好影响
She's a good influence on Michael.


312
00:21:04.428 --> 00:21:06.721
你别那么迂腐
You should stop being so old-fashioned.


313
00:21:10.767 --> 00:21:12.935
你妈妈遇到大卫可真幸运
I think it's so lucky that your Mom met David.


314
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.603
为什么这么说
Why is that?


315
00:21:14.688 --> 00:21:18.566
他会是你能与我一起待在这里的关键因素
He is gonna be your ticket to staying here with me.


316
00:21:19.943 --> 00:21:21.444
或许我并不想与你一起待在这里呢
Maybe I don't want to stay here with you.


317
00:21:21.528 --> 00:21:24.363
或许你想回到那个全是男生的军校去
Maybe you want to go back to an all-boys military school.


318
00:21:24.448 --> 00:21:25.781
或许呢
Maybe.


319
00:21:32.247 --> 00:21:33.885
可是我喜欢看着你
But I like looking at you.


320
00:21:33.886 --> 00:21:36.417
这就是为什么我们是天生一对的原因
That's why we make a good couple.


321
00:21:36.501 --> 00:21:38.419
因为我喜欢你看着我
Because I like you looking at me.


322
00:21:53.268 --> 00:21:54.769
你还好吗  肖恩
You okay, Sean?


323
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.439
我很好
Yeah, I'm okay.


324
00:21:59.775 --> 00:22:02.401
-你确定吗  兄弟  -这样真好
- You sure, buddy? - This is great.


325
00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:04.278
我真怀念这样的家庭聚餐
I've missed family dinners like this.


326
00:22:04.363 --> 00:22:06.493
怀念?  这是不是意味着
You've missed them? Does that mean


327
00:22:06.494 --> 00:22:07.656
你以前结过婚
you were married before?


328
00:22:07.741 --> 00:22:09.603
大卫在一场车祸中失去了
David lost his wife and daughter


329
00:22:09.604 --> 00:22:10.534
他的妻子和女儿
in an accident.


330
00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:12.995
是的  司机喝醉了
Yeah, a drunk driver.


331
00:22:15.707 --> 00:22:17.556
我不知道  真对不起
I had no idea. I'm sorry,


332
00:22:17.557 --> 00:22:19.251
大卫  我很抱歉
David. I'm sorry.


333
00:22:19.336 --> 00:22:20.622
我想这就是为什么家庭对我
I guess that's why family is


334
00:22:20.623 --> 00:22:22.338
这么重要的原因  迈克尔
so important to me, Michael.


335
00:22:22.422 --> 00:22:24.256
是的  家庭很重要
Well, family is important.


336
00:22:24.341 --> 00:22:26.884
我们家可没有这么好的经验
We haven't always had such great experiences as a family.


337
00:22:26.968 --> 00:22:28.719
这可不全是爸爸的错
Hey, it wasn't all Dad's fault.


338
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.887
我没说是他的错
No, I didn't say it was.


339
00:22:29.971 --> 00:22:32.056
但我们家其实也没那么糟
But, you know, our family wasn't that bad.


340
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.523
我在电视上看到一个女人开车
I saw on TV this woman who drove


341
00:22:33.524 --> 00:22:35.684
带上3个小孩从桥上冲了下去
off a bridge with her three kids in the back seat.


342
00:22:35.769 --> 00:22:38.229
小姑娘  这可不适合吃饭的时候聊
That is so not dinner-table conversation, young lady.


343
00:22:38.313 --> 00:22:39.918
他们全淹死了
They all drowned.


344
00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:41.524
这种事真让我费解
That kind of thing really gets to me,


345
00:22:41.608 --> 00:22:43.234
居然有人能这样对自己的孩子
that someone could do that to her own children.


346
00:22:43.318 --> 00:22:44.527
这真让人搞不懂  要怎么样才会让一个
It makes you wonder, though, what it takes


347
00:22:44.611 --> 00:22:45.694
人做这么变态的事情啊
to make someone do something so sick.


348
00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:47.397
好了  我们谈点别的吧
Okay. Can we change the conversation?


349
00:22:47.398 --> 00:22:48.322
好的  对不起
Yeah, I'm sorry.


350
00:22:48.407 --> 00:22:49.865
爸爸
Dad!


351
00:22:51.493 --> 00:22:53.786
也许他们让她失望了
Maybe they disappointed her.


352
00:22:58.375 --> 00:22:59.458
爸爸
Dad!


353
00:22:59.543 --> 00:23:01.210
你们好吗  我来拿
Hey, how are you? Let me take this.


354
00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:02.044
我很好  谢谢
I'm good. Thanks.


355
00:23:02.129 --> 00:23:04.046
-亲爱的  -爸爸
- Hey, sweetie. - Hi, Dad.


356
00:23:04.673 --> 00:23:07.091
-你不去跟他问声好吗  -不去
- Aren't you gonna say hello to him? - No.


357
00:23:09.136 --> 00:23:10.428
-猎枪  -什么
- Shotgun! - What?


358
00:23:10.512 --> 00:23:12.721
你不可能有猎枪的
There's no way you're getting shotgun.


359
00:23:12.806 --> 00:23:16.267
孩子们  别闹了
Hey. Hey, work it out, guys. Work it out.


360
00:23:16.351 --> 00:23:17.643
周日带他们回来  他们要去露营
Back on Sunday. They're going to camp.


361
00:23:17.727 --> 00:23:19.205
我们还有很多事要做
We have a million things to do.


362
00:23:19.206 --> 00:23:20.438
我知道他们要去露营
I know they're going to camp.


363
00:23:20.522 --> 00:23:21.702
我只在城里留几天
I'm only in town a couple days.


364
00:23:21.703 --> 00:23:23.149
带他们去看场开拓者的球赛
I'm taking the kids to a Blazers Game.


365
00:23:23.233 --> 00:23:24.895
他们晚上可以跟我一起住在宾馆里
They can spend the night with me at the hotel.


366
00:23:24.896 --> 00:23:25.943
明天我就把他们送回来
I'll have them back tomorrow.


367
00:23:26.027 --> 00:23:29.613
-你那个还是学生的女朋友呢  -那都过去了
- Where's the co-ed girlfriend? - That's over.


368
00:23:30.031 --> 00:23:31.526
实际上  她现在正在攻读博士
Actually, she was working for a Ph.D.


369
00:23:31.527 --> 00:23:33.492
她其实不比你年轻多少
She wasn't that much younger than you were.


370
00:23:33.577 --> 00:23:37.246
她只是对自己更加细心一些而已
She just took a little better care of herself, that's all.


371
00:23:38.206 --> 00:23:41.333
-迈克尔回家了吗  -他不想见你
- Is Michael home? - He doesn't want to see you.


372
00:23:41.793 --> 00:23:44.211
-这是他说的还是你说的  -他说的
- Those his words or yours? - His.


373
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.423
我说的是"你要晚了登记入住了"
"Your check is late" are mine.


374
00:23:47.757 --> 00:23:48.889
只是确认一下你没有在里面花钱
Just make sure you don't spend


375
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.551
找人取代我
any of the money on my replacement in there.


376
00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:53.762
没有必要找人取代你  杰伊  没人想念你
It's not necessary to replace you, Jay. You're not missed.


377
00:23:55.098 --> 00:23:56.932
我也很高兴见到你  苏珊
Good to see you, too, Susan.


378
00:23:57.976 --> 00:23:59.393
你们准备好了吗
You guys ready?


379
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.312
没事吧
Everything okay?


380
00:24:02.355 --> 00:24:04.565
他永远都这么混蛋
He's just always such an ass.


381
00:24:08.028 --> 00:24:09.640
迈克尔  杰姬让我明天下午
So, Michael, Jackie has


382
00:24:09.641 --> 00:24:12.656
去一个开放销售的房屋那里看看

383
00:24:12.741 --> 00:24:14.366
明天你和我中午一起吃个饭  怎么样
but let's you and me have lunch tomorrow. What do you say?


384
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:16.410
那太好了
That'd be really nice.


385
00:24:17.579 --> 00:24:20.331
-很好  -太好了
- Yeah, that'd be good. - Great.


386
00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:32.843
卡特太太  你好
Hey, Mrs. Cutter, how are you?


387
00:24:32.928 --> 00:24:34.553
你好  苏珊
I'm fine, Susan.


388
00:24:35.096 --> 00:24:37.097
有张通缉犯的画像...
There was a police sketch...


389
00:24:45.857 --> 00:24:48.275
我可以保证那不是大卫
I can assure you it's not David.


390
00:24:49.778 --> 00:24:51.987
别担心  那绝对不是他
Don't worry. It's so not him.


391
00:24:52.072 --> 00:24:54.031
好吧  如果你看见了  到我这边来  我们可以聊聊
Okay. If you see it, come over and let's talk about it.


392
00:24:54.115 --> 00:24:56.909
-好的  谢谢了  卡特太太  -没事
- Okay. Thanks, Mrs. Cutter. - All right.


393
00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:05.084
-你还好吗  -是的
- You all right? - Yeah.


394
00:25:05.168 --> 00:25:06.116
是卡特太太
That was Mrs. Cutter.


395
00:25:06.117 --> 00:25:08.420
她被邻里称为"养猫老太"
She's known in the neighborhood as "The cat lady. "


396
00:25:08.505 --> 00:25:11.382
带着她那一大堆猫中的一只顺道经过
Stopped by with one of her gazillion cats.


397
00:25:11.967 --> 00:25:14.969
-真让我过敏  -她说什么了
- They make my allergies go crazy. - What'd she want?


398
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.408
她想告诉我
Wanted to tell me that she


399
00:25:17.409 --> 00:25:20.266
她在美国头号通缉犯的网页上
had seen this story on America's Most Wanted


400
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.562
看到了一个凶手
about this killer and


401
00:25:21.563 --> 00:25:24.103
那凶手的画像和你很像
that the police sketch looked just like you.


402
00:25:24.187 --> 00:25:26.647
我只能憋住不在她面前笑出来
It was all I could do not to laugh in her face.


403
00:25:26.731 --> 00:25:28.357
你认识艾瑞卡·哈蒙吗
You know Erica Harmon, right?


404
00:25:28.441 --> 00:25:29.229
几年前
Okay, so a couple years ago,


405
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.069
她跟艾瑞卡·哈蒙的老公说
she tells Erica Harmon's husband


406
00:25:32.153 --> 00:25:33.543
艾瑞卡有外遇
that Erica is having an affair


407
00:25:33.544 --> 00:25:35.906
因为她每天早晨都看到有个男的
because she sees this man sneaking into their house


408
00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:37.992
在他一离开后就溜进他们家
every morning just after he leaves.


409
00:25:38.076 --> 00:25:40.703
-她真的有婚外恋吗  -是
- And was she? - Well, yeah.


410
00:25:40.787 --> 00:25:41.965
那不就得了
Well, there you go, then.


411
00:25:41.966 --> 00:25:42.997
可那不关她的事
Well, it wasn't any of her business


412
00:25:43.081 --> 00:25:45.749
而且她在告诉他之前  跟整个邻里都说了一遍
and she told the entire neighborhood before she told him.


413
00:25:45.834 --> 00:25:49.336
太棒了  这将让我成为邻里间的大人物  是吗
Great. This'll make me a hit with the neighbors, huh?


414
00:25:50.839 --> 00:25:52.423
我得走了
I gotta go.


415
00:25:56.761 --> 00:25:58.009
我觉得我还不如
I think I'd rather be the


416
00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.306
那个偷溜进哈蒙太太家的神秘男人
mystery man sneaking into Mrs. Harmon's house.


417
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.558
-她长什么样  -别说了
- What's she look like? - Stop it.


418
00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:04.905
你们在哪儿吃午餐
Hey, where are you having lunch?


419
00:26:04.906 --> 00:26:06.103
我到时候要送迈克尔过去
Because I need to drop Michael off.


420
00:26:06.187 --> 00:26:07.813
办公室附近有个小餐厅
There's a diner across from the office


421
00:26:07.897 --> 00:26:10.274
吃完之后我会在去开放房屋的路上把他送回家
and I'll bring him home on my way to the open house.


422
00:26:10.358 --> 00:26:11.984
祝你今天愉快
Have a great day.


423
00:26:24.497 --> 00:26:27.541
-早上好  妈妈  -早上好  懒鬼
- Hey, Mom. - Hey, sleepyhead.

-想吃点什么吗  -嗯  谢谢
- Want something to eat? - Yes, please.


425

好的
Okay.


426
00:26:33.548 --> 00:26:36.717
-大卫哪儿了  -你刚跟他错过
- Where's David? - You just missed him.


427
00:26:39.888 --> 00:26:41.847
卡特太太  早上好
Good morning, Mrs. Cutter.


428
00:26:54.319 --> 00:26:56.445
想吃甜点吗
Okay, anybody got a sweet tooth?


429
00:26:56.529 --> 00:26:57.696
-想要点甜点吗  -不了
- Do you want dessert? - No, no.


430
00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:00.157
-你确定吗  再来点茶  还是什么  -不了 我饱了
- You sure? Some more tea? Anything? - No. No, I'm fine.

00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:01.950
-那好吧  买单  谢谢  -没问题
- All right. Just the check, please. - No problem.

- Thank you for lunch, by the way. - Absolutely. So...


433
00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:10.000
我真正想跟你说的是...
What I really wanted to talk to you about was...


434
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.128
我需要你的帮助
Well, I need a favor.


435
00:27:13.213 --> 00:27:15.130
什么帮助
Well, what kind of favor?


436
00:27:15.215 --> 00:27:17.049
我想让你做我的伴郎
I'd like you to be my best man.


437
00:27:17.967 --> 00:27:20.260
-我?  -如果你能答应的话  我会感到非常荣幸
- Me? - I'd really be honored if you would.


438
00:27:20.345 --> 00:27:22.429
我没有更好的人选了
There's no one else I'd rather have.


439
00:27:22.514 --> 00:27:23.764
我知道我有时候对家庭问题
I know sometimes I get a


440
00:27:23.765 --> 00:27:26.266
变得有点激动
little carried away with the whole family thing,


441
00:27:26.351 --> 00:27:29.770
但是  我真的非常高兴你回来了
but, you know, truth is, I'm really happy you're home.


442
00:27:29.854 --> 00:27:32.106
而且  像我说的那样  我要确保你一直在家里住着
And like I said, I'm gonna make sure you stay home


443
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.942
确保这个家庭完整  好吗
and this family stays complete. Right?


444
00:27:35.568 --> 00:27:37.152
-给您  -谢谢

我知道你妈妈会很高兴的

太棒了  这太棒了
That's great. That is great!


450
00:27:54.295 --> 00:27:55.891
为了不显得那么多愁善感
You know, without sounding too sentimental,


451
00:27:55.892 --> 00:27:56.505
我想跟你说
I want to tell you,


452
00:27:56.589 --> 00:27:58.906
那天在超市与你母亲的相遇
meeting your mother that day in the supermarket


453
00:27:58.907 --> 00:28:00.259
改变了我的人生
changed my life.


454
00:28:00.427 --> 00:28:02.469
一切曾经都那么冷酷无情
It was hard, you know,


455
00:28:03.596 --> 00:28:05.973
在我的妻子和女儿遇害之后
after what happened to my wife and daughter.


456
00:28:06.057 --> 00:28:09.727
我亲爱的米歇尔是我的全部
My little Michelle was my whole world, my whole life.


457
00:28:09.811 --> 00:28:11.520
看着她成长是我生命的全部
Watching her grow up was everything.


458
00:28:13.273 --> 00:28:14.525
你会明白我说的话
You'll understand what I'm talking about


459
00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.692
等你有了自己的孩子
when you have kids of your own.


460
00:28:16.776 --> 00:28:18.831
并不是说让你和凯莉仓促地做些什么
Not that you and Kelly should be rushing into anything.


461
00:28:18.832 --> 00:28:19.027
好吗
Okay?


462

不  不  别担心
No, no, no. Don't worry.

如果你精明的话  这还有好些年呢
You got years to go if you're smart.


464
00:28:25.869 --> 00:28:29.329
当那来临时  我认为你就该明白我的意思了
When it happens, I think you'll see what I mean.


465
00:28:30.415 --> 00:28:31.999
他们就是全部
They're everything.


466
00:28:33.668 --> 00:28:36.378

469
00:28:43.011 --> 00:28:45.262
不好意思  我以为你说她叫米歇尔
I'm sorry. I thought you said her name was Michelle.


470
00:28:47.307 --> 00:28:48.515
是吗
Did I?


471
00:28:51.311 --> 00:28:54.605
是丽莎-米歇尔  你肯定听错了
It's Lisa-Michelle. You must have heard it wrong.

537
00:35:04.058 --> 00:35:06.620
如果你再敢对我孩子动手
If you ever lay a hand on one of my kids again,


538
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:08.395
你他妈就死定了
it'll be the last thing you ever do!


539
00:35:08.479 --> 00:35:09.729
你说什么
What are you talking about?


540
00:35:09.814 --> 00:35:11.352
这混蛋想要掐死肖恩
This bastard tried to choke Sean.


541
00:35:11.353 --> 00:35:12.232
我没掐任何人
I didn't choke anybody.


542
00:35:12.316 --> 00:35:14.317
肖恩说你用手圈住他的脖子  而且很疼
Sean says you put your hand around his neck and it hurt.


543
00:35:14.402 --> 00:35:15.412
他妈妈跟他说让他
His mother told him to turn


544
00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:17.320
把游戏声音关小点  他不听
down his video game and he wasn't listening to her.


545
00:35:17.405 --> 00:35:19.197
我只是想告诉他要有点规矩
I was just trying to show him a little discipline.


546
00:35:19.282 --> 00:35:21.241
从我看到的来说  这家里是少了点规矩
From what I've seen, that's lacking a bit in this family.


547
00:35:21.325 --> 00:35:22.993
如果你再敢碰我的孩子
If you ever touch my family again,


548
00:35:23.077 --> 00:35:24.911
-我就杀了你  我对上帝发誓  -别闹了
- I will kill you! I swear to God! - Stop it.


549
00:35:24.996 --> 00:35:26.830
-拜托...  -这已经不是你的家了  杰伊
- Come on... - This is not your family anymore, Jay.


550
00:35:26.914 --> 00:35:28.290
-你对这个男人都了解些什么  -停下
- What do you even know about this guy? - Stop.


551
00:35:28.374 --> 00:35:29.416
-你对这个男人都了解些什么  -别闹了
- What do you know about him? - Stop it!


552
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.667
我知道他没跟他的秘书上床
I know he's not sleeping with his secretary!


553
00:35:30.751 --> 00:35:31.918
你什么都不知道
You don't know a goddamn thing!


554
00:35:32.003 --> 00:35:33.471
如果你再不走我就叫警察了
I'll call the police if you don't leave!


555
00:35:33.472 --> 00:35:34.254
你什么都不知道
Not a goddamn thing!


556
00:35:34.338 --> 00:35:36.339
你听到我说的了  你要是再碰我的孩子
You heard what I said. You touch my kids again,


557
00:35:36.424 --> 00:35:38.425
你麻烦就大了
you got some big trouble coming.


558
00:35:41.095 --> 00:35:42.470
上帝啊
Oh, my God.


559
00:35:43.347 --> 00:35:44.723
对不起
I'm so sorry.


560
00:35:44.807 --> 00:35:46.683
没事  过来
It's okay. Come here.


561
00:35:46.767 --> 00:35:48.310
对不起
I'm so sorry.


562
00:35:49.061 --> 00:35:50.064
他有什么权利
He had no goddamn right


563
00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:51.897
那样抓着肖恩  凭什么
grabbing Sean like that. No goddamn right!


564
00:35:51.981 --> 00:35:55.609
你以后别再这样了  拜托  冷静点
You can't do this anymore! Come on. Calm down, please.


565
00:35:58.112 --> 00:35:59.487
爸爸  给
Dad, here.


566
00:36:00.198 --> 00:36:01.284
你掉了这个
You dropped this.


567
00:36:01.285 --> 00:36:03.241
你要走的时候  它从你口袋里掉出来了
It fell out of your pocket when you were going at it.


568
00:36:05.912 --> 00:36:07.037
谢谢
Thanks.


569
00:36:11.918 --> 00:36:13.668
你阻止了我在里面做蠢事
You stopped me from doing something really dumb in there.


570
00:36:13.753 --> 00:36:15.629
可能吧
Yeah, I probably did.


571
00:36:16.923 --> 00:36:18.423
我不喜欢这个人
I don't like this guy.


572
00:36:19.008 --> 00:36:21.509
我不相信他  你了解他吗
I don't trust him. I mean, what do you know about this guy?


573
00:36:21.594 --> 00:36:23.220
不比你了解的多
Not any more than you, really.


574
00:36:27.642 --> 00:36:28.975
你长高了
You got taller.


575
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:34.814
你得知道  已经一年了
Yeah, well, you know, it's been a year.


576

不知道  想和你聊聊
I don't know. I want to talk to you.


579
00:36:42.795 --> 00:36:44.616
你妈妈说你不想见我
Your Mom says you don't want to see me.


580
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.201
是真的吗
Is that true?


581
00:36:49.997 --> 00:36:52.958
我不知道  爸爸  可不是我离开家的
I don't know, Dad. You know, I'm not the one who left.


582
00:36:53.584 --> 00:36:55.502
我离开了你妈妈  但我没离开你
I left your Mom. I didn't leave you.


583
00:36:56.128 --> 00:36:58.463
你们这些孩子对我来说是世界上最重要的
You kids are the most important thing in the world to me.


584

Well, yeah, yeah, you have a funny way of showing that.


585
00:37:00.383 --> 00:37:01.957
我知道我搞砸了
Hey, I know. I screwed up.


586
00:37:01.958 --> 00:37:03.658
我感到很抱歉
I feel really bad about that,


587
00:37:03.659 --> 00:37:04.678
但我想补偿你
but I'd like to make it up to you.


588
00:37:06.347 --> 00:37:07.818
怎么  你以后不再见我了

No.


591
00:37:11.394 --> 00:37:13.019

593
00:37:17.024 --> 00:37:18.984
我想我不应该告诉爸爸
I guess I shouldn't have told Dad.

00:37:19.568 --> 00:37:21.569
-到底什么...  -那不是你的错  肖恩
- Well, what... - No, it wasn't your fault, Sean.


595
00:37:25.199 --> 00:37:28.785
我不应该那样做的  那不对
I shouldn't have done what I did. It wasn't right.


596
00:37:31.539 --> 00:37:33.123
我不是你爸爸
I'm not your father.


597
00:37:33.207 --> 00:37:36.042
可能以后的某天会是...
Maybe someday, but...


598
00:37:37.628 --> 00:37:41.131
但这对我来说是新的  我会犯错
This is all new to me again. I'm gonna make mistakes.


599

我希望你可以原谅我的所作所为

我不该那样做
I shouldn't have done it.


606

608
00:38:39.877 --> 00:38:43.151
一切有多容易坍塌
and I know how easy it can all fall apart.


609
00:38:47.782 --> 00:38:49.501
如果我要成为你的一部分

我需要得到他们的尊重

我不知道你是如何成长起来的
I don't know how you were raised,


613
00:38:54.426 --> 00:38:56.581
大卫  但是我家不允许体罚

632
00:41:01.515 --> 00:41:04.167
人事部说他们给过你表格让你填

633
00:41:04.251 --> 00:41:05.886
但你没给他们

It just wasn't something I enjoyed doing, that's all.


639

我不明白
Well, I don't understand,


640
00:41:25.508 --> 00:41:29.025
杰姬说你天生就是做这个的

641
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:30.693
房地产跟我不搭

我知道你多不想让我离开
I know how much you hate me being gone,


647
00:41:44.242 --> 00:41:45.959
但那是我最了解的一行

让我用你电脑查查

老兄  你最好小点声

652

你担心大卫吗
Are you worried about David?


653
00:42:07.815 --> 00:42:10.567
他不会碰你的  放心  我保证

我真没用

00:43:43.339 --> 00:43:45.453
肖恩和迈克尔在楼上玩游戏
Sean and Michael are upstairs playing video games.


671
00:43:47.164 --> 00:43:48.247
听着...
Look...


672
00:43:49.958 --> 00:43:51.876
那天晚上的事情  对不起
I'm sorry about the other night.


673
00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.508
我那天晚上太混蛋了
I made an ass out of myself.


674
00:43:53.509 --> 00:43:55.338
当我和苏珊吵架的时候...
It's just when Susan and I fight...


675
00:44:01.595 --> 00:44:03.379
我要去机场
I was headed to the airport.


676
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.057
我想和孩子们说声再见...
I wanted to say goodbye to the kids and...


677
00:44:07.101 --> 00:44:10.061
我想和你道歉
Well, I'd like to apologize to you


678
00:44:10.145 --> 00:44:11.688
我太神经质了
for being a jerk.


679
00:44:14.775 --> 00:44:18.027
我接受你的道歉  进来跟他们道别吧
Apology accepted. Come on in and say goodbye.


680
00:44:23.617 --> 00:44:26.869
迈克尔告诉我你曾效力于鸭子泳队
Hey, Michael tells me you used to swim for the Ducks?


681
00:44:26.954 --> 00:44:28.079
很久以前的事了
A long time ago.


682
00:44:28.163 --> 00:44:29.872
-是吗  哪一年  -92年
- Yeah? What year? - '92.


683
00:44:29.957 --> 00:44:33.251
真的吗  我亲自去了俄勒冈大学
Really? I went to U of O myself.


684
00:44:34.962 --> 00:44:36.755
我得接下电话  不好意思
I got to grab that. Excuse me.


685
00:44:37.043 --> 00:44:38.464
当然  当然
Sure. Sure.


686
00:44:45.973 --> 00:44:48.099
杰伊给我发了条信息
Jay had left a message on my cell phone


687
00:44:48.183 --> 00:44:50.977
说他会顺便过去和孩子们道别
saying he was gonna stop by there to say goodbye to the kids.


688
00:44:51.061 --> 00:44:54.564
-他来了没  -没有  还没
- Did he come yet? - No. Not yet.


689
00:44:54.648 --> 00:44:57.734
好吧  如果他来了  你可以退让一些吗
Okay, well, if he does, will you just stay out of the way?


690
00:44:58.986 --> 00:45:01.654
好的  我们一会儿见
All right. I'll see you later then.


691
00:45:05.367 --> 00:45:07.744
你想听听一些有趣的事吗
Hey, you want to hear something funny?


692
00:45:07.828 --> 00:45:09.579
我给校友办公室打了电话
I called the alumni office


693
00:45:09.663 --> 00:45:13.682
他们告诉我  他们只有4个叫大卫·哈里斯的
and they told me they only had four guys named David Harris


694
00:45:13.683 --> 00:45:15.334
在30年前毕业过
graduate in the last 30 years.


695
00:45:15.919 --> 00:45:19.172
其中2个已经死了  还有一个87年毕业
And two of them are dead and one graduated in '87.


696
00:45:19.506 --> 00:45:22.925
另外一个是个四季度全美最佳跑卫
And the other one was that all-American running back.


697
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.343
你记得他吧
You remember him?


698
00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:29.182
当然啦  他比你稍微黑一点  你不觉得吗
Of course, he's a little darker than you are, wouldn't you say?


699
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.350
那么...
So...


700
00:45:32.978 --> 00:45:35.772
这样看起来你似乎对迈克尔说了谎
It's just...it seems like you might have lied to Michael


701
00:45:35.856 --> 00:45:38.232
关于大学和游泳的事
about college and swimming.


702
00:45:39.318 --> 00:45:42.278
这让我现在很想知道
And now it's got me wondering


703
00:45:42.362 --> 00:45:45.615
就是...你还说了什么谎
just, you know, what else you might've lied about.


704
00:45:58.545 --> 00:46:01.297
听着  我告诉迈克尔  我会向你核实
Hey, look, I told Michael that I would do some checking on you


705
00:46:01.381 --> 00:46:03.966
而且  说实话  我很想得到答案
and, to be honest, I'd like some answers.


706
00:46:06.929 --> 00:46:09.180
你听到了吗
Hey. You hear me?


707
00:46:10.265 --> 00:46:11.390
听到了
Yep.


708
00:46:19.483 --> 00:46:22.151
-怎么了  -我听到有声音
- What? - I heard something.


709
00:46:34.915 --> 00:46:36.707
是什么
What was it?


710
00:46:36.792 --> 00:46:39.043
我不知道  没什么
I don't know. It's nothing.


711
00:46:44.091 --> 00:46:46.050
我不懂  我有点困惑  因为...
I don't understand. I'm kind of confused, because...


712
00:46:46.134 --> 00:46:47.426
什么
About?


713
00:46:47.511 --> 00:46:49.679
买家的反馈非常好
Well, the feedback from the buyers was great.


714
00:46:49.763 --> 00:46:53.516
他只是觉得  那跟他想的不太一样而已
He just felt that it wasn't what he thought it was gonna be.


715
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.725
他四处奔波你都没问题吗
You're okay with him on the road?


716
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:56.306
他正在试着找
He's gonna try to find something


717
00:46:56.307 --> 00:46:58.271
可以不需要经常出差的工作
where he doesn't have to travel that much.


718
00:46:58.856 --> 00:47:03.109
我只是希望他能开心  他快乐我就快乐
And I just want him to be happy. If he's happy, I'm happy.


719
00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:06.320
你可以走了  我想拿一下他的行李
There you go. I just want to get his bags.


720
00:47:09.074 --> 00:47:11.409
-打开后备箱  -你拿吧
- Pop the trunk? - You got it.


721
00:47:49.323 --> 00:47:51.657
我是杰伊·哈丁  请留言
This is Jay Harding. Leave a message.


722
00:47:51.742 --> 00:47:53.659
爸爸  是我
Hey, Dad. It's me.


723
00:47:55.621 --> 00:47:58.706
你在哪儿  给我回电话  再见
Where are you? Call me. Bye.


724
00:48:20.979 --> 00:48:22.229
大卫
David!


725
00:48:23.982 --> 00:48:25.274
什么事  迈克尔
Yeah, what do you need, Michael?


726
00:48:33.283 --> 00:48:34.533
没什么
Nothing.


727
00:48:42.626 --> 00:48:45.711
其实在迈克尔的派对上  你问我
You know when you asked me at Michael's party


728
00:48:45.796 --> 00:48:47.964
我是不是觉得你太冲动
if I thought you were rushing into things?


729
00:48:49.466 --> 00:48:51.217
我现在觉得你也许是有点
I'm thinking now that maybe you are.


730
00:48:51.802 --> 00:48:54.470
你对大卫到底了解多少
I mean, how much do you really know about David?


731
00:48:54.554 --> 00:48:58.425
我向他要他资料的同一天
The same day that I ask him for details about his past,


732
00:48:58.426 --> 00:49:00.267
他就不干了
he just up and quits.


733
00:49:00.352 --> 00:49:03.437
-你不觉得奇怪吗  -不  不觉得
- You don't find that strange? - No, I don't.


734
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:09.735
你知道我想做什么吗  我想去拉斯维加斯
You know what I want to do? I want to go to Vegas


735
00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.548
然后举办那种只要10分钟的婚礼
and have one of those 10-minute weddings.


736
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:13.155
很不错
Nice.


737
00:49:14.074 --> 00:49:16.409
大卫想要在教堂结婚
David wants to have a church wedding.


738
00:49:16.493 --> 00:49:18.170
很不错  什么教堂
That's great. What church? I mean,


739
00:49:18.171 --> 00:49:19.996
你都不知道他信什么吧
do you even know what religion he is?


740
00:49:20.497 --> 00:49:22.415
我才不在乎他信什么教
I don't care what goddamn religion he is.


741
00:49:25.711 --> 00:49:29.755
好了  你都开始听起来像杰伊了
Okay, you're starting to sound just like Jay.


742
00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.297
他指责我对大卫一无所知
He's accused me of not knowing anything about David.


743
00:49:32.298 --> 00:49:33.426
你知道我知道的是什么吗
You know what I do know?


744
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:35.302
大卫对我很好
David has been good to me.


745
00:49:35.387 --> 00:49:38.097
他对孩子们也很好  他们喜欢他
He's good to the kids. They love him.


746
00:49:38.724 --> 00:49:41.976
他使我的生命重获意义  我...
He's made my life worth living again. I mean, I...


747
00:49:42.978 --> 00:49:44.687
很久以来  第一次
For the first time in a long time,


748
00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:47.231
我满怀微笑期待未来
I'm looking forward to the future with a smile.


749
00:49:47.315 --> 00:49:51.227
我只希望大家会为我高兴
I just wish everybody would be happy for me.


750
00:49:51.228 --> 00:49:53.362
这个要求很过分吗
Is that too much to ask?


751
00:49:54.906 --> 00:49:56.240
不  一点也不
No, it's not.


752
00:49:56.324 --> 00:49:57.739
就个人而言  我支持你
Personally, I'm with you. Hey,


753
00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.910
要是可以  我要在拉斯维加斯洗牙
I'd have my teeth cleaned in Vegas if I could.


754
00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.954
可以吧
Right?


755
00:50:02.539 --> 00:50:06.542
-冲  冲  冲  小心  -我刚避开了那辆车
- Go! Go! Go! Watch it! - I just missed that car.


756
00:50:06.626 --> 00:50:08.044
伙计们
Hey, guys.


757
00:50:08.128 --> 00:50:09.879
-妈妈  -和杰姬还有莉亚进行得怎么样
- Hey, Mom. - How'd it go with Jackie and Leah?


758
00:50:09.963 --> 00:50:13.174
我们决定该去维加斯
We decided we should go to Vegas.


759
00:50:14.426 --> 00:50:17.053
-我马上就回来  -迈克尔呢
- I'll be right back. - Where's Michael?


760
00:50:18.096 --> 00:50:19.597
他在他房间
He's in his room.


761
00:50:19.681 --> 00:50:22.683
我觉得他很郁闷他父亲一直没有出现
I think he's a little upset that his father never showed.


762
00:50:24.478 --> 00:50:26.479
这果然很杰伊
That is so typical of Jay.


763
00:50:29.149 --> 00:50:30.649
-亲爱的  -什么
- Honey? - Yeah.


764
00:50:31.026 --> 00:50:33.402
我有事向你忏悔
I have a confession to make.


765
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.896
我不小心摔坏了
I accidentally broke the


766
00:50:36.897 --> 00:50:39.658
客厅的这个水晶花瓶
crystal vase that was in the living room.


767
00:50:46.458 --> 00:50:47.917
没关系的
That's okay.


768
00:50:48.001 --> 00:50:49.987
它是杰伊的姐姐送的结婚礼物
It was a wedding gift from Jay's sister.


769
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:51.170
反正我从来没喜欢过它
I never liked it anyway.


770
00:50:51.254 --> 00:50:52.922
你不喜欢?
You didn't?


771
00:50:53.006 --> 00:50:55.674
-还有她  -那我就不觉得内疚了
- Or her. - Then I don't feel so bad.


772
00:51:02.182 --> 00:51:04.266
你不觉得这有点古怪吗
You don't think it's a little weird


773
00:51:04.351 --> 00:51:07.394
我问他要背景资料  然后突然间
that I ask for some background information, and suddenly,


774
00:51:07.479 --> 00:51:09.355
他就不想再做房地产了
he doesn't want to sell real estate anymore?


775
00:51:09.439 --> 00:51:11.398
不  没必要啊
No, not necessarily.


776
00:51:11.483 --> 00:51:13.901
我喜欢大卫  他是个绅士
I like David. He's a gentleman.


777
00:51:13.985 --> 00:51:16.570
他总是买单  杰伊就很小气
He always picks up the tab. Jay was so cheap.


778
00:51:16.655 --> 00:51:18.878
不过你知道我觉得什么奇怪吗
Do you know what I do think is weird,


779
00:51:18.879 --> 00:51:20.741
他总是付现金
though? He always pays in cash.


780
00:51:20.826 --> 00:51:22.952
谁不想要积分换里程
Who doesn't want the miles?


781
00:51:30.043 --> 00:51:33.546
你知道吗  我从没想过我会这么说
You know, I never thought I would ever say this,


782
00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:37.675
不过我觉得我要给杰伊打个电话
but I think I'm gonna give Jay a call.


783
00:51:37.759 --> 00:51:40.404
如果他也不信大卫
I mean, if he's not buying this either,


784
00:51:40.405 --> 00:51:42.847
那么也许就值得调查一下了
then maybe it's worth checking into.


785
00:51:48.728 --> 00:51:51.272
他没有现身吗
Hey. He didn't show up?


786
00:51:52.858 --> 00:51:54.024
对
No.


787
00:51:55.902 --> 00:51:57.361
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.


788
00:51:57.445 --> 00:51:59.905
-没关系  -不  有关系
- That's okay. - No, it's not okay.


789
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:01.150
他从未在你需要的时候出现过
He's never been there for you


790
00:52:01.203 --> 00:52:02.575
像一个父亲该做的那样
like a father should be.


791
00:52:02.659 --> 00:52:03.826
而有一部分是我的错
And part of that's my fault


792
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:04.799
因为我不应该
because I never should


793
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.537
允许它继续了那么久
have allowed it to go on as long as it did.


794
00:52:07.914 --> 00:52:10.087
所以大卫才对我如此重要
That's why David's so important to me.


795
00:52:10.088 --> 00:52:11.917
因为他在乎你们
Because he cares about you kids.


796
00:52:12.002 --> 00:52:14.712
他想要你在这儿  成为你生活的一部分
He wants you to be here and be part of your lives.


797
00:52:14.796 --> 00:52:16.839
他也太完美了吧
He's so perfect, isn't he?


798
00:52:19.426 --> 00:52:21.093
摘下来
Take those off.


799
00:52:23.388 --> 00:52:26.682
我以为你可以看出大卫让我多快乐
I thought you'd be able to see how happy David makes me.


800
00:52:26.766 --> 00:52:28.434
他现在是这个家的一份子
He is part of this family now.


801
00:52:28.518 --> 00:52:29.825
我想要他进入我的生活
I want him in my life and


802
00:52:29.826 --> 00:52:32.021
还有我们的生活  你得理解
our lives and you need to understand that.


803
00:52:32.105 --> 00:52:35.316
-你明白吗  迈克尔  -是的  我明白  好了吧
- Do you understand that, Michael? - Yeah. I understand. Okay?


804
00:52:41.823 --> 00:52:42.990
好吧
Okay.


805
00:52:59.382 --> 00:53:01.300
-大卫  你在下面吗...  -我正在收拾东西
- David, are you down... - I'm just putting some things away.


806
00:53:01.384 --> 00:53:04.136
-马上就上去  -好
- I'll be right up. - Okay.


807
00:53:27.827 --> 00:53:29.411
对不起  我没能来
Sorry I didn't make it.


808
00:53:29.496 --> 00:53:30.770
下次一定
Definitely next time.


809
00:53:30.771 --> 00:53:33.624
不过我查了你未来继父
But I did check out your soon-to-be stepfather.


810
00:53:33.708 --> 00:53:35.376
我还是不喜欢他
I still don't like him,


811
00:53:35.377 --> 00:53:38.712
但至少他看起来和他说的一样
but at least he seems to be who he says he is.


812
00:53:38.797 --> 00:53:41.340
能见到你很高兴  迈克尔  爸爸
It was good seeing you, Michael. Dad.


813
00:55:01.546 --> 00:55:03.839
罗伯特  那儿怎么了
Hey, Robert. What happened over there?


814
00:55:03.923 --> 00:55:05.924
卡特太太死了  发生了意外
Mrs. Cutter died. She had an accident.


815
00:55:07.302 --> 00:55:09.291
我猜她侄女打了好几通电话
I guess her niece called a couple of times.


816
00:55:09.292 --> 00:55:10.679
却一直得不到回音
Didn't hear anything from her.


817
00:55:10.764 --> 00:55:13.640
所以今早她顺道过来  却发现她的尸体
So she stopped by the house and found her just this morning.


818
00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:17.644
-这太杯具了  -希望你过得愉快  再见
- That's sad. - Have a good one.


819
00:55:24.277 --> 00:55:27.863
妈妈  对面停了好多警车
Mom? There's a bunch of police cars across the street.


820
00:55:27.947 --> 00:55:29.239
发生了什么事
What's going on?


821
00:55:29.324 --> 00:55:31.075
住在对面的那个老太太
The old woman across the street?


822
00:55:31.159 --> 00:55:32.083
她从楼梯上摔下来了
She fell down her stairs


823
00:55:32.084 --> 00:55:33.702
摔断了脖子   养猫的那个
and broke her neck. The one with the cats.


824
00:55:33.787 --> 00:55:35.079
-卡特太太?  -是的
- Mrs. Cutter? - Yeah.


825
00:55:35.163 --> 00:55:37.581
太可怕了  什么时候发生的
That's horrible. When did it happen?


826
00:55:37.665 --> 00:55:40.125
邮递员说她侄女今早发现她的
The mailman said her niece found her this morning.


827
00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:41.710
她好可怜
That poor woman.


828
00:55:41.795 --> 00:55:44.505
肖恩  快点  我们得走了  宝贝
Sean. Hurry. We got to go, honey.


829
00:55:45.006 --> 00:55:47.883
我说她的那些话  实在是太愧疚了
All those things I've said about her. I feel terrible.


830
00:55:47.967 --> 00:55:49.021
这可真让人心碎
It breaks my heart.


831
00:55:49.022 --> 00:55:51.387
别忘了从牙医那里接他们回来  好吗
Will you remember to pick them up from the dentist? OK?


832
00:55:51.471 --> 00:55:55.391
-好  我会的  再见了  孩子们  -再见
- Yeah, I will. Okay, guys. - Bye.


833
00:55:55.475 --> 00:55:57.643
-一会儿见  -一会儿见
- See you. - I'll see you.


834
00:56:17.497 --> 00:56:20.332
-你好  -大卫  我是杰姬
- Hello. - David, it's Jackie.


835
00:56:20.417 --> 00:56:21.458
你好  杰姬  有事吗
Hey, Jackie. What's up?


836
00:56:21.543 --> 00:56:24.086
我打来是为了提醒你那些表格
I'm just calling to remind you about those forms.


837
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:25.963
-我已经不在那儿工作了  -我知道
- I'm not working there anymore. - I know.


838
00:56:26.047 --> 00:56:29.466
只是我们还是需要州和联邦的纳税通知单
It's just, we still need the state and federal tax papers


839
00:56:29.551 --> 00:56:31.427
而且我明天就走
and I'm leaving tomorrow.


840
00:56:31.511 --> 00:56:34.638
我要飞去夏威夷两星期和莉亚见面
I'm catching a flight to meet Leah in Hawaii for two weeks,


841
00:56:34.722 --> 00:56:37.433
所以我很想在走之前把文件都整理好
and so I'd really like to get that paperwork in before I leave.


842
00:56:37.517 --> 00:56:38.951
我今天很忙
I'm a bit crunched for time today.


843
00:56:38.952 --> 00:56:41.145
我一会儿还要从牙医那里把孩子们接回来...
I have to pick the kids up from the dentist later...


844
00:56:41.229 --> 00:56:42.855
只需要几分钟就好
It'll only take a few minutes.


845
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:51.071
-我尽量吧  -谢...
- I'll see what I can do. - Thanks...


846
00:56:57.203 --> 00:56:59.663
卡特太太的事太让人难过了  不是吗
It's really too bad what happened to Mrs. Cutter, isn't it?


847
00:57:01.082 --> 00:57:02.875
人有旦夕祸福
Accidents happen.


848
00:57:04.252 --> 00:57:06.712
是她大限已到罢了
It just must have been her time.


849
00:57:11.926 --> 00:57:13.802
大学申请书
College applications.


850
00:57:13.887 --> 00:57:15.004
我的辅导员说我们应该
My adviser said we should


851
00:57:15.005 --> 00:57:16.972
早点申请  免得我们进不了俄勒冈大学
file early in case we don't get into U of O.


852
00:57:17.056 --> 00:57:18.599
好吧
Okay.


853
00:57:18.683 --> 00:57:20.559
-快来  -来啦
- Come on. - I'm coming.


854
00:57:27.984 --> 00:57:30.569
听起来充其量都是些捕风捉影
It all sounds circumstantial at best to me.


855
00:57:30.653 --> 00:57:32.571
我知道  我知道是的
I know, I know it does. I know it does.


856
00:57:32.655 --> 00:57:35.032
但是我跟你说  这真的让我心里发毛了
But I'm telling you, it's really starting to give me the creeps.


857
00:57:35.116 --> 00:57:36.533
你仔细想想  拜托
Just think about it, please.


858
00:57:36.618 --> 00:57:39.328
一天  这个女人告诉我妈妈她看的这个节目
One day, this woman tells my Mom about this show that she saw,


859
00:57:39.412 --> 00:57:41.622
第二天  她就死了  她现在死了
and the next, she's dead. She's dead now.


860
00:57:41.706 --> 00:57:43.999
这是个意外  你自己说的
It was an accident. You said so yourself.


861
00:57:44.083 --> 00:57:45.042
那他是怎么知道的
So how does he know that


862
00:57:45.126 --> 00:57:46.168
她从楼梯上滚下来摔断了脖子
she broke her neck falling down the stairs?


863
00:57:46.252 --> 00:57:47.028
他怎么会知道
How does he know that?


864
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:48.545
邮递员根本只字未提
The mailman never said anything about that.


865
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:51.089
他们说的话我全听到了  我发誓
I heard the whole conversation, I swear.


866
00:57:51.424 --> 00:57:53.467
我要是能告诉我妈就好了
I wish I could tell my Mom about this.


867
00:57:53.551 --> 00:57:54.919
如果跟你妈妈提这件事
If you bring this up to your Mom,


868
00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:55.761
她会把你送回去的
she's gonna send you back.


869
00:58:04.854 --> 00:58:08.607
你必须承认  他在餐桌上对
Hey, you got to admit, the comment at the dinner table


870
00:58:08.691 --> 00:58:12.027
杀了自己骨肉的那个女人的评论很不寻常
about the woman who killed her kids was kind of weird.


871
00:58:12.111 --> 00:58:13.348
拜托  我毫不夸张地说这很奇怪
Come on, it was weird to say the least.


872
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.196
还有他女儿
And then his daughter.


873
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.739
怎么可能有人搞不清自己女儿的名字
How do you mix up your daughter's name like that?


874
00:58:15.823 --> 00:58:18.424
他没有  她的名字叫丽莎-米歇尔
He didn't. Her name was Lisa-Michelle.


875
00:58:18.425 --> 00:58:20.410
你说是他说的
That's what you said he said.


876
00:58:20.495 --> 00:58:22.871
-我是说了  但你不在那儿  -是啊
- I said he said that. But you weren't there. - Right?


877
00:58:22.956 --> 00:58:24.456
你没有看到他的表情  都写在他的脸上了
You didn't see his face. It's in his face.


878
00:58:25.458 --> 00:58:28.043
我就直说吧
Let me get this straight, all right?


879
00:58:28.503 --> 00:58:29.962
-那个古怪的邻居...  -是的
- The neighborhood weirdo... - Yeah.


880
00:58:30.046 --> 00:58:32.172
看了一部关于一个男人屠杀了全家的节目
...sees a show about a man who kills his family


881
00:58:32.257 --> 00:58:34.778
然后你觉得那个大卫
and then you think that David


882
00:58:34.779 --> 00:58:36.718
混淆了自己女儿的名字
mixed up the name of his daughter,


883
00:58:36.803 --> 00:58:40.305
因此他就是那个杀了他全家的家伙
So therefore he's the guy that killed his family?


884
00:58:40.848 --> 00:58:43.809
-我不知道  -是啊  我就是这么理解的
- I don't know. - Yeah, that all adds up to me.


885
00:58:50.608 --> 00:58:53.193
听着  你说过你父亲调查过他了  对吧
Look, you said your Dad checked up on him, right?


886
00:58:53.278 --> 00:58:55.279
-而且什么问题都没有  -是的
- And everything was cool. - Yeah.


887
00:58:55.363 --> 00:58:57.322
那么好了  对吧
Okay, then. Right?


888
00:58:59.826 --> 00:59:01.368
什么事也没有  放轻松
It's fine. Relax.


889
00:59:11.337 --> 00:59:13.088
我们不先把这个做完吗
Are we gonna finish these?


890
00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.340
宝贝  拜托
Babe, come on.


891
00:59:16.968 --> 00:59:18.051
该死  迈克尔
Damn it, Michael.


892
00:59:29.188 --> 00:59:30.939
迈克尔
Michael.


893
00:59:35.194 --> 00:59:36.862
你在钻牛角尖
You're obsessing.


894
00:59:37.572 --> 00:59:39.255
你知道吗  你只是有点
You know, you're just a little


895
00:59:39.256 --> 00:59:41.950
受不了你妈妈嫁给一个陌生人罢了
freaked out that your Mom's marrying a stranger.


896
00:59:42.035 --> 00:59:45.203
我妈妈要嫁给杰克时我也是这样的
I was the same way when my Mom was gonna marry Jack.


897
00:59:45.288 --> 00:59:49.249
后来却发现他很不错
You know? And then he turned out to be cool.


898
00:59:51.461 --> 00:59:53.879
如果你一定要对什么固执
If you're gonna obsess about something,


899
00:59:53.963 --> 00:59:56.048
你应该对真正有意义的事固执
you should obsess about something that really matters.


900
00:59:57.216 --> 00:59:58.383
比如
Like what?


901
00:59:58.968 --> 01:00:00.302
比如我
Like me.


902
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:07.267
我不想再和你异地恋了
I don't want to have another long-distance relationship with you.


903
01:00:11.022 --> 01:00:12.939
所以注意重点
So keep your eye on the ball.


904
01:00:31.918 --> 01:00:34.961
我要去接肖恩和贝斯  一小时后回来
I'm gonna pick up Sean and Beth. I'll be back in an hour.


905
01:00:35.046 --> 01:00:37.964
-你们俩没问题吧  -没有  会有什么问题
- Will you two be all right? - Yeah, why wouldn't we be?


906
01:00:38.633 --> 01:00:41.468
一会儿见  规矩点
I'll see you in a while then. Behave.


907
01:00:57.944 --> 01:00:59.194
走
Come on.


908
01:00:59.278 --> 01:01:02.197
-你要干什么  -我想翻一下他的东西
- What are you gonna do? - I'm just gonna look through his stuff.


909
01:01:02.365 --> 01:01:03.865
你疯了
You're crazy.


910
01:01:05.451 --> 01:01:08.995
-你会后悔的  -除非我被抓住了
- You're so gonna regret doing this. - Only if I get caught.


911
01:01:19.465 --> 01:01:21.133
迈克尔  拜托  我不想这么做
Michael, come on, I don't want to do this.


912
01:01:21.217 --> 01:01:22.194
听着  如果我们什么也没找到
Look, if we find nothing,


913
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:23.802
我就再也不提了  我保证
I'll drop it forever. I promise.


914
01:01:30.184 --> 01:01:31.226
我刚买完东西
I just finished shopping,


915
01:01:31.227 --> 01:01:32.894
所以还是我去接孩子吧
so I'm gonna pick the kids up after all.


916
01:01:32.979 --> 01:01:34.934
我刚离开家  已经在路上了
I just left the house. I'm on my way.


917
01:01:34.935 --> 01:01:36.940
不用了  我就快到了
That's okay 'cause I'm so much closer.


918
01:01:37.024 --> 01:01:39.401
-不过还是谢谢  -那好吧
- But thank you. - Well, okay then.


919
01:01:39.485 --> 01:01:41.903
-家里见  再见  -好  再见
- I'll see you at home. Bye. - Okay. Bye.


920
01:02:07.346 --> 01:02:09.097
你刚听到了没
Did you just hear that?


921
01:02:09.515 --> 01:02:13.185
没有  这儿只有我们  凯莉  没关系
No. We're alone, Kelly. It's fine.


922
01:02:30.453 --> 01:02:32.954
天啊  天啊  该死
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Shit!


923
01:02:33.664 --> 01:02:34.873
操
Shit!


924
01:03:08.407 --> 01:03:10.283
迈克尔
Michael.


925
01:03:13.162 --> 01:03:15.121
迈克尔  你在里面吗
Michael, you in there?


926
01:03:17.375 --> 01:03:19.167
你在这里吗  迈克尔
You in here, Michael?


927
01:04:21.939 --> 01:04:23.356
迈克尔
Michael!


928
01:04:39.081 --> 01:04:41.541
迈克尔  你爸爸后来有联络你吗
Michael, did you ever hear from your Dad?


929
01:04:41.918 --> 01:04:44.586
我收到一条他发的短信...
Well, I got a text message from him, so...


930
01:04:45.087 --> 01:04:46.671
真的?  他说了什么
Really? What'd he say?


931
01:04:48.007 --> 01:04:51.885
只是说他感到很抱歉  没有在起飞前过来
Just that he was sorry for not coming by before his flight.


932
01:04:51.969 --> 01:04:53.128
我试着打了几个电话
I've tried calling a couple


933
01:04:53.129 --> 01:04:54.888
但只接通了语音留言  所以...
times and I just get his voicemail, so...


934
01:04:56.098 --> 01:04:58.224
我不知道  我可能今晚会给他发短信吧
I don't know. I'll probably text him tonight.


935
01:04:58.726 --> 01:04:59.946
亲爱的  他肯定是
Honey, I'm sure he just


936
01:04:59.947 --> 01:05:02.228
工作太忙了  你也知道你爸
got crazy with work. You know how Dad gets.


937
01:05:02.313 --> 01:05:04.356
对  没事  我知道
Yeah, yeah. No, I know.


938
01:05:08.361 --> 01:05:09.569
大卫?
David?


939
01:05:19.914 --> 01:05:21.373
大卫  你没事吧
David, you okay?


940
01:05:23.459 --> 01:05:25.043
我很好
Yes, I'm fine.


941
01:05:27.421 --> 01:05:30.048
我知道  我差点尿裤子  我吓死了
I know. I almost pissed my pants, I was so scared.


942
01:05:30.132 --> 01:05:32.784
那可不会让我冲动  顺便说一句
You know, that's not a turn-on, by the way.


943
01:05:32.785 --> 01:05:33.927
迈克尔  闭嘴  我是认真的
Michael, shut up. I'm being serious.


944
01:05:34.011 --> 01:05:36.096
-我知道  我知道  -真的?
- I know. I know. - You do?


945
01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.999
是的  我一直在
Yeah. I mean, I've been thinking


946
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.558
考虑你说的话  所有的事情  真的
about what you said, about all of it, really.


947
01:05:40.643 --> 01:05:43.687
然后我决定...
And I've decided that...


948
01:05:45.064 --> 01:05:46.764
你是对的  我是说也许  也许
That you're right. I mean, maybe, maybe,


949
01:05:46.765 --> 01:05:47.565
我是在钻牛角尖了
I am obsessing.


950
01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:49.943
-你真这么想?  -我爸爸说没事  所以...
- You think? - I mean, my Dad said he was all right, so...


951
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:52.696
我想我只是因为不习惯而已
I guess the rest of it is just me freaking out.


952
01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:54.990
我觉得你该明天来
I think you should come by tomorrow


953
01:05:55.074 --> 01:05:56.408
我们填完那些大学申请表
and we'll get these college applications finished.


954
01:05:56.492 --> 01:05:59.411
-不再钻牛角尖了?  -对  我对天发誓
- No more obsessing? - No, no, no, I swear on my life.


955
01:06:00.246 --> 01:06:02.747
-好吧  那么明天见  -好  晚安
- All right? So I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Good night.


956
01:06:02.832 --> 01:06:03.957
好  晚安
Okay. Night.


957
01:06:12.133 --> 01:06:13.717
进来吧
Yeah, come in.


958
01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:16.886
-有时间吧  -当然  怎么了
- Hey, you got a sec? - Sure. What's up?


959
01:06:18.264 --> 01:06:20.348
-你好吗  -不错
- How you doing? - Fine.


960
01:06:24.478 --> 01:06:26.780
也许我误会了  不过一度
Maybe I'm wrong, but for a while there,


961
01:06:26.781 --> 01:06:29.024
我以为我们有个好的开始
I thought we were off to a good start.


962
01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:31.149
而现在我开始觉得
And now I'm getting the


963
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:34.279
我们有点不投缘
feeling that somehow we're not on the same page.


964
01:06:35.906 --> 01:06:38.783
我知道不可能一蹴而就  迈克尔
I know it can't happen overnight, Michael.


965
01:06:40.119 --> 01:06:41.494
但为了这个家
But for the sake of the family,


966
01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:44.956
你必须明白这里要有所改变了
you gotta understand that things are going to change around here.


967
01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:47.292
不会像以前一样
It's not gonna be like it was,


968
01:06:48.544 --> 01:06:49.961
但希望可以更好
but hopefully better.


969
01:06:50.046 --> 01:06:52.422
-对  我明白  我知道  -很好
- Yeah, I do. I know. - Good.


970
01:06:56.802 --> 01:06:59.512
我只是希望你可以对我光明磊落
I just want you to always be up-front with me.


971
01:07:00.598 --> 01:07:03.183
不要说谎  不要偷偷摸摸的
No lies, no sneaking around.


972
01:07:03.976 --> 01:07:05.769
你妈妈不会喜欢你这样的
Your Mom wouldn't like that.


973
01:07:06.562 --> 01:07:08.980
你需要赢回她对你的信任
And you need to win back her trust.


974
01:07:19.492 --> 01:07:23.161
我不想看到你不得不再回到那个学校去了
I don't want to see you have to go back to that school again.


975
01:08:03.202 --> 01:08:05.995
-你对天发誓了的  -就看看警方的素描
- You swore on your life. - Just look at the police sketches.


976
01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.580
求你了  我别无他求
Please, that's all I'm asking.


977
01:08:10.084 --> 01:08:11.768
他们确实神似  你得承认
There is a resemblance. You got to admit,


978
01:08:11.769 --> 01:08:12.836
这个有点像他
it kind of looks like him.


979
01:08:19.051 --> 01:08:21.177
你知道这个其实像谁吗
You know who this actually looks like?


980
01:08:21.887 --> 01:08:23.012
他看起来像洛克威尔先生
It looks like Mr. Rockwell,


981
01:08:23.013 --> 01:08:24.639
我们高中一年级的生物老师
our biology teacher from freshman year.


982
01:08:24.723 --> 01:08:25.575
才不  你根本没认真看
No, you hardly looked at it.


983
01:08:25.651 --> 01:08:27.308
好吧  他可以是任何人
All right. It could be anybody.


984
01:08:27.393 --> 01:08:28.838
听着  这是格雷迪·爱德华
Look, this is Grady Edwards.


985
01:08:28.906 --> 01:08:30.103
警方无法确认他的身份
The police couldn't match his ID.


986
01:08:30.187 --> 01:08:32.522
他们没有发现任何指纹  而且不谋而合的是
They couldn't trace any fingerprints. And there are similarities.


987
01:08:32.606 --> 01:08:35.150
也说他做过销售  也说他经常出差
He said he was in sales. He said he traveled a lot.


988
01:08:35.234 --> 01:08:36.651
他们也从没有发现任何他的照片
They can never find any pictures of him either,


989
01:08:36.735 --> 01:08:37.944
所以我今早问了贝斯
so I asked Beth this morning


990
01:08:38.028 --> 01:08:40.618
她能不能在家里找到大卫的照片
if she could find any pictures of him in the house,


991
01:08:40.619 --> 01:08:41.865
随便什么照片都行
any pictures of David.


992
01:08:41.865 --> 01:08:43.783
结果什么也没有  他根本就不拍照
There aren't any because he doesn't like having his picture taken, apparently.


993
01:08:43.868 --> 01:08:46.169
那又怎样  我也不喜欢
So what? Neither do I.


994
01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:47.704
但我发誓我没有杀那个女人和她的孩子
But I swear I didn't kill that woman and her kids. Okay?


995
01:08:47.788 --> 01:08:48.836
这什么也证明不了
It doesn't prove anything.


996
01:08:48.837 --> 01:08:50.373
历史记录里有这个网站
The website was in the browser history.


997
01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:53.042
-他肯定看过  -那又怎样
- He was checking it out. - So what if he was?


998
01:08:53.627 --> 01:08:55.086
也有可能是你妈妈
Or maybe it was your Mom.


999
01:08:55.171 --> 01:08:57.572
或者是他们两个人
Or maybe they both were


1000
01:08:57.573 --> 01:08:59.174
都是听了卡特夫人的话好奇看的
because they were curious about what Mrs. Cutter said.


1001
01:08:59.258 --> 01:09:02.093
你不是也因此看过了吗
I mean, that's what made you check it out.


1002
01:09:02.469 --> 01:09:03.928
好吧
All right.


1003
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:06.848
没什么了  当我没说
It's fine. Just forget about it.


1004
01:09:15.274 --> 01:09:18.818
-我们还要填完这些东西吗  迈克尔  -等等吧
- Are we gonna finish these, Michael? - Hold on one second.


1005
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:28.453
怎么了  你不想再和我上同一所大学了?
What is it? You just don't want to go to college with me anymore?


1006
01:09:33.542 --> 01:09:35.501
顺便说下  我和马克·霍福德有一腿
By the way, I'm screwing Mark Helford.


1007
01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:42.383
你说什么
What?


1008
01:09:44.011 --> 01:09:46.512
我要走了  回家了
I'm leaving. I'm going home.


1009
01:09:49.183 --> 01:09:50.892
晚点打给我  不然后果你知道的
Call me later. Or, you know what,


1010
01:09:50.976 --> 01:09:53.436
还是别打了  我不在乎
don't actually. I don't care. Whatever. You know.


1011
01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.979
凯莉  凯莉  别这样
Kelly. Kelly, come on.


1012
01:10:10.496 --> 01:10:13.298
对不起  我不知道你在这里
I'm sorry. God, I didn't even know you were there.


1013
01:10:13.299 --> 01:10:15.166
你吓了我一大跳  哈里斯先生
You scared me, Mr. Harris.


1014
01:10:15.251 --> 01:10:16.709
叫我大卫就行
Call me David.


1015
01:10:17.711 --> 01:10:21.214
我只是来喝点柠檬汽水的  来点吗
I was just getting myself a lemonade. Do you want one?


1016
01:10:22.424 --> 01:10:23.758
不用了  谢谢
No, that's okay.


1017
01:10:25.719 --> 01:10:29.305
你和迈克尔看起来好像闹矛盾了
Looked like Michael and you were having a bit of a fight.


1018
01:10:32.309 --> 01:10:33.434
没有
No.


1019
01:10:35.771 --> 01:10:37.563
真的没什么
It's nothing, really.


1020
01:10:39.233 --> 01:10:40.775
要我帮忙吗
Anything I can help you with?


1021
01:10:40.859 --> 01:10:42.986
-不用了  没事  -真的?
- No, it's cool. - You sure?


1022
01:10:44.196 --> 01:10:46.155
他好像有什么心事
Something seems to be troubling him.


1023
01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.074
或许我们两能帮他走出困惑
Maybe the two of us can help him work it out.


1024
01:10:53.622 --> 01:10:55.665
我也不知道  或许只是...
I don't know. It's just...


1025
01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:59.794
我不明白  他最近很混蛋
I don't get it. He's been such a jerk lately.


1026
01:11:00.212 --> 01:11:03.423
这才叫男人  我们都是混蛋
It's called being a guy. We're all jerks.


1027
01:11:03.716 --> 01:11:05.449
所以女人才喜欢
That's why you women like us.


1028
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:07.760
我们就像你们的研究课题
We're like projects you take on.


1029
01:11:13.726 --> 01:11:15.226
听着  凯莉
See, Kelly,


1030
01:11:16.061 --> 01:11:20.106
你这样的女孩成熟得很快
Young women like you seem to mature faster.


1031
01:11:20.524 --> 01:11:23.776
而男孩要更长时间才能赶上
It takes boys a little longer to catch up.


1032
01:11:24.945 --> 01:11:28.740
也许哪天你会成为哈丁家的一员
You know, you might be a part of the Harding family one day.


1033
01:11:29.408 --> 01:11:33.286
我也希望你能把我看成家人
And I'd like you to think of me as you would the others, as family, too.


1034
01:11:34.413 --> 01:11:35.997
我会的
Yeah, I do.


1035
01:11:36.081 --> 01:11:38.916
那是肯定的
I mean, you know, I will.


1036
01:11:42.796 --> 01:11:44.839
有什么需要帮忙
And if you ever need anything,


1037
01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.259
来找我好了
please come to me.


1038
01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.096
尤其是关于迈克尔的
Especially if it concerns Michael.


1039
01:11:54.516 --> 01:11:58.353
我们谁也不想看到他做傻事  对吧
Neither of us want to see him do something stupid, do we?


1040
01:11:58.437 --> 01:12:00.980
做出那些要让他回军校的事情
Something that might get him sent back to military school.


1041
01:12:01.648 --> 01:12:02.982
他不会的
He won't.


1042
01:12:04.943 --> 01:12:06.694
但是谢谢你  哈里斯先生
But thank you, Mr. Harris.


1043
01:12:07.821 --> 01:12:10.698
大卫  叫我大卫就行
David. Call me David.


1044
01:12:25.547 --> 01:12:28.800
我现在不在  有事请留言
Hi. I'm not here, I'm there. Leave a message.


1045
01:12:28.884 --> 01:12:30.343
是我
Hey, it's me.


1046
01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:35.306
我晚上非常想见你  给我电话  再见
I really want to see you tonight, so give me a call. Bye.


1047
01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:46.328
很抱歉这么长时间才回复你
Sorry it took so long to get back.


1048
01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:48.403
过几天我打给你
I'll try to call you in the next few days.


1049
01:12:49.321 --> 01:12:51.364
希望你一切都好  爸爸
Hope all is well. Dad.


1050
01:13:07.464 --> 01:13:09.342
我一直在试着打你电话
I've tried to reach you on your phone.


1051
01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:10.925
想和你谈谈关于大卫的事
Want to talk to you about David.


1052
01:13:11.176 --> 01:13:12.802
给我电话  杰姬
Call me. Jackie.


1053
01:13:42.875 --> 01:13:45.209
我是杰伊·哈丁  请留言
This is Jay Harding. Leave a message.


1054
01:13:46.378 --> 01:13:47.628
我还要再考虑下再给你电话
I have to call you back on that,


1055
01:13:47.713 --> 01:13:50.089
但是报酬听起来还能接受
but the money sounds like we're in the ballpark.


1056
01:13:50.174 --> 01:13:52.216
明天再谈  好的
We'll talk tomorrow. All right.


1057
01:13:53.802 --> 01:13:56.179
怎么了  迈克尔  你看起来像撞鬼了
What's up, Michael? You look like you've seen a ghost.


1058
01:13:57.556 --> 01:13:58.890
没有  我...
No, I...


1059
01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.443
我听到电话响了
I heard a phone ring.


1060
01:14:02.444 --> 01:14:04.562
我以为是地下室的声音
I thought it sounded like it was coming from the basement.


1061
01:14:04.646 --> 01:14:06.320
是我的电话
You probably just heard mine.


1062
01:14:06.321 --> 01:14:09.150
我就要有工作了
I got a call on a job. I think I'm gonna take it.


1063
01:14:09.234 --> 01:14:12.403
报酬还不错  还不用经常出差
Money sounds good. I won't have to travel much.


1064
01:14:13.238 --> 01:14:16.657
钥匙在哪儿  大卫  地下室的钥匙呢
Hey, where's the key? David, where's the key to the basement?


1065
01:14:16.742 --> 01:14:18.618
我刚才还在想
Yeah, I was wondering that myself.


1066
01:14:18.702 --> 01:14:21.454
我要下去找些工具  可钥匙不见了
I needed to get some of my tools this morning. The key was gone.


1067
01:14:21.538 --> 01:14:23.456
或许有人拿了忘记放回去
Someone took it out and forgot to put it back.


1068
01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.666
忘了放回什么
Forgot to put what back?


1069
01:14:25.751 --> 01:14:27.126
-亲爱的  -伙计们
- Hey, honey. - Hey, guys.


1070
01:14:27.211 --> 01:14:29.813
地下室的钥匙不见了
That key to the lock on the basement door is missing.


1071
01:14:29.814 --> 01:14:31.631
明天早上我来叫个锁匠
I'll call a locksmith in the morning.


1072
01:14:31.715 --> 01:14:33.216
或者
Better yet,


1073
01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.551
我去商场买把新锁来换
I'll go down to home depot and get a replacement.


1074
01:14:35.552 --> 01:14:37.053
这把都旧了
That lock was getting old.


1075
01:14:37.137 --> 01:14:40.806
我自己就能弄好的  顺便说下
I can do the work myself. By the way,


1076
01:14:40.891 --> 01:14:42.642
我找到工作了
I think I found a job.


1077
01:14:43.268 --> 01:14:44.602
太棒了
That's fantastic.


1078
01:14:44.686 --> 01:14:48.189
是的  报酬很好而且出差少
Yeah, the pay's good and very little travel.


1079
01:14:48.482 --> 01:14:51.275
-我喜欢  -就知道你会的

- Maybe you should get a job this summer. - He's already got one.


1082
01:15:11.421 --> 01:15:12.713
他是这个泳池的救生员
He's the lifeguard at the pool here.


1083
01:15:12.798 --> 01:15:14.749
不  我是认真的
No, no, I'm serious.


1084
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.050
这样你就能攒钱买车了
That way you could earn money toward getting a car.


1085
01:15:16.134 --> 01:15:18.261
你领到驾照了
You're getting your license.


1086
01:15:18.345 --> 01:15:20.388
需要一辆自己的车
You're gonna need a car of your own.


1087
01:15:20.472 --> 01:15:23.641
尤其是你要在波特兰读高三的话
Especially if you're gonna spend your senior year here in Portland.


1088
01:15:23.725 --> 01:15:25.351
-等等  妈妈  -你是认真的吗
- Wait, Mom. - Are you serious?


1089
01:15:25.435 --> 01:15:28.604
-你是说真的?  -是的  我想大卫是对的
- Wait, do you mean that? - Yeah, I think David's right.


1090
01:15:28.689 --> 01:15:32.233
只有你在  我们才是一个完整的家庭
The only way for us to be a proper family is if you're home with us.


1091
01:15:32.317 --> 01:15:35.236
况且你上了大学  就不会回家了
Besides, when you go to college, you're not going to come back.


1092
01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.072
-谁要甜点  -我要
- Who wants dessert? - Me. I do.


1093
01:15:38.865 --> 01:15:41.492
我想把肖恩和贝斯送到卡根家里去
I'm gonna drop Sean and Beth off at the Kagan's,


1094
01:15:41.577 --> 01:15:42.952
让他们在那里过夜
cause they're gonna spend the night


1095
01:15:43.036 --> 01:15:45.830
卡利的妈妈明天会送他们去野营
and then Carrie's Mom's gonna drive them up to camp tomorrow.


1096
01:15:45.914 --> 01:15:47.873
-想一起来吗  -我很想去
- Want to ride with me? - I wish I could.


1097
01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:50.585
但我要上网去把这个工作定下来
But I need to get back on the internet and finalize this job.


1098
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:53.170
用不了几个小时
Okay. I should only be a couple hours.


1099
01:15:53.255 --> 01:15:55.172
就几个小时  好的
A couple hours. Okay.


1100
01:15:58.051 --> 01:16:00.469
-玩得开心  -再见

1101
01:16:02.055 --> 01:16:03.472
-再见  -再见  大卫

1102
01:16:05.684 --> 01:16:07.685
-苏珊  -怎么了
- Susan. - Yeah.


1103
01:16:08.145 --> 01:16:09.520
我爱你
I love you.


1104
01:16:10.981 --> 01:16:12.648
我也爱你
I love you, too.


1105
01:16:36.715 --> 01:16:39.175
你晚上有什么计划
What are your plans this evening?


1106
01:16:41.511 --> 01:16:43.220
我可能要去见凯莉
I might go see Kelly.


1107
01:16:43.805 --> 01:16:45.222
要多久
For how long?


1108
01:16:46.016 --> 01:16:47.808
还不确定  怎么了
I don't know. Why?


1109
01:16:48.602 --> 01:16:52.813
当心点  新闻说风暴雨要来了
Just be careful. The news said there's a big storm headed this way.


1110
01:17:35.774 --> 01:17:36.899
没有了
It's gone.


1111
01:17:36.983 --> 01:17:39.193
-什么东西  -我以前拍过的他的照片
- What? - The shot I took of him before?


1112
01:17:39.277 --> 01:17:40.248
没有了  都被他删了
It's gone. He deleted it


1113
01:17:40.249 --> 01:17:42.029
现在一张他的照片也没有了
and now there's no pictures of him anywhere.


1114
01:17:42.114 --> 01:17:44.699
-或许是你不小心删的  -不会的...
- Well, maybe you deleted it by accident. - No, I didn't...


1115
01:17:44.783 --> 01:17:46.033
你没听见我说吗
Have you not been listening to me?


1116
01:17:46.118 --> 01:17:47.952
我想你说过他没有看到你拍
I thought you said he didn't see you take it.


1117
01:17:48.036 --> 01:17:49.662
或许他看到了
Maybe he did or maybe he's been


1118
01:17:49.746 --> 01:17:51.038
或许他看了我的手机  我也不知道
checking my phone this whole time. I don't know.


1119
01:17:51.123 --> 01:17:54.263
我洗澡的时候他来我房间的
But he came into my room when I was in the shower.


1120
01:17:54.264 --> 01:17:56.085
他删的  我知道是他干的
He deleted it. I know he did.


1121
01:17:56.169 --> 01:17:58.206
他不想拍这些照片
He doesn't want his picture taken.


1122
01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:00.131
但这并不能说明他就是凶手
That doesn't mean he's a killer.


1123
01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.112
地下室的钥匙并没有丢
The key to the basement didn't just get lost, all right.


1124
01:18:07.113 --> 01:18:07.722
他一直在下面
He's always down there.


1125
01:18:07.806 --> 01:18:09.515
他在遮掩着什么
He's hiding something.


1126
01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.269
天气怎样  我正在收拾行李
So what's the weather like? I'm trying to pack.


1127
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:16.897
你只需要比基尼和微笑
All you're gonna need is a bikini and a smile.


1128
01:18:16.982 --> 01:18:18.462
但你只要记得带上比基尼
Neither if you forget the bikini,


1129
01:18:18.463 --> 01:18:20.526
因为我的微笑就够我们俩用了
because I'll have enough smile for both of us.


1130
01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:24.530
-等会儿  -你在打电话?
- Hold on a sec. - Are you on your cell phone?


1131
01:18:24.614 --> 01:18:25.740
我是苏珊  请留言...
Hey. This is Susan. Leave me a message...


1132
01:18:25.824 --> 01:18:28.409
如果你还有事情没忙完  先放放吧
If you're trying to do some last-minute business, give it a rest.


1133
01:18:28.493 --> 01:18:30.710
你还有3个小时就要上飞机了
You've got a plane to catch in three hours.


1134
01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:32.288
不是的  我在找苏珊
No, I'm trying to reach Susan.


1135
01:18:32.372 --> 01:18:34.123
我想我干了件蠢事
I think I did something stupid.


1136
01:18:34.207 --> 01:18:35.624
我给杰伊打了电话
I called Jay


1137
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:39.420
我还留言让他调查大卫的背景
and I left a message that I wanted him to do a background check on David.


1138
01:18:39.504 --> 01:18:41.672
你也知道这很愚蠢了?
You think you did something stupid?


1139
01:18:42.174 --> 01:18:45.760
我打给大卫关于w-2s的事情  他挂了我电话
Listen, I called him about the W-2s and he hung up on me.


1140
01:18:45.844 --> 01:18:48.763
他从来没有兑现过他说的
He never did anything he said that he would.


1141
01:18:48.847 --> 01:18:50.598
她会杀了你的
She is going to kill you.


1142
01:18:50.682 --> 01:18:55.603
我知道  所以我才要在杰伊之前找到她
I know. That's why I need to reach her before Jay gets to her first. Okay?


1143
01:18:55.687 --> 01:18:57.196
所以  帮帮我吧
So, please, do me a favor.


1144
01:18:57.197 --> 01:18:59.982
等我到洛杉矶转机的时候再打给你  好吗
I will call you during my layover in L.A., okay?


1145
01:19:00.066 --> 01:19:03.110
不用了  我今晚要去环游小岛的聚会
No, don't. I'm going on a party cruise around the island tonight.


1146
01:19:03.195 --> 01:19:05.362
-真的?  -快来吧
- Really? - Just get here!


1147
01:19:06.865 --> 01:19:08.199
我尽量
I'm trying.


1148
01:19:09.284 --> 01:19:11.702
-爱你  -同样爱你  再见
- Love you. - Love you, too. Bye.


1149
01:19:33.225 --> 01:19:35.326
在我离开之前联系不上你
I wasn't able to get you on your cell phone before I left,


1150
01:19:35.327 --> 01:19:36.687
但我想告诉你
but I wanted you to know


1151
01:19:36.688 --> 01:19:40.314
我曾让杰伊调查大卫的背景
that I left a message for Jay to run a background check on David.


1152
01:19:40.398 --> 01:19:42.399
至今仍没有消息
And I haven't heard back,


1153
01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.374
因此我会在到达机场后
so I'm gonna call this investigator we use at the office


1154
01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:44.836
打电话给我们办公室的调查员
when I get to the airport.


1155
01:19:44.837 --> 01:19:46.403
在你生气之前我想告诉你
Before you go ballistic, let me tell you


1156
01:19:46.488 --> 01:19:50.366
他拒绝向我提供任何身份或是工资证明
that he refuses to give any identification for insurance and payroll.


1157
01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:52.868
而且还向我撒了谎  肯定有什么隐情
And he lied to me. There's something not right here.


1158
01:19:52.953 --> 01:19:54.995
还有20分钟我就要去机场了
I'm leaving for the airport in about 20 minutes.


1159
01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.164
如果你没什么说的  等我回来打给你
If we don't talk, I'll call when I get back.


1160
01:19:57.249 --> 01:20:00.167
我爱你  不要生气
I love you. Don't be mad, please.


1161
01:20:12.556 --> 01:20:13.597

1162
01:20:13.682 --> 01:20:17.268

上帝  你吓到我了  还以为家里没人
God, you scared me. I didn't think anybody was home.


1164
01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:05.352
-你提前回来了  -对  你去跑步了?
- You're home early. - What, did you go running?


1165
01:23:05.437 --> 01:23:08.397
-我要让我的头脑清醒一下  -杰姬打来电话了吗
- I needed to clear my head. - Did Jackie call?


1166
01:23:09.441 --> 01:23:10.524
我在家时没有
Not since I've been home.


1167
01:23:10.608 --> 01:23:12.735
我有一个未接来电不过她没有留言
Because I had a missed call and she didn't leave a message.


1168
01:23:12.819 --> 01:23:14.695
我试着联系她  可是联系不到
I tried to reach her. I couldn't.


1169
01:23:14.779 --> 01:23:17.448
-迈克尔呢  -一直在凯莉那里
- Where's Michael? - Over at Kelly's.


1170

我要赶紧去换身衣服
I'm gonna change clothes real quick.


1171
01:23:36.634 --> 01:23:39.011
上帝  我讨厌这样的鬼天气
God, I hate it when it storms like this.


1172
01:23:40.305 --> 01:23:43.348
在这样电闪雷鸣的天里我总是睡不着
I can never sleep with all this thunder and lightning.


1173
01:23:48.313 --> 01:23:50.230
给  吃片这个
Here. Take one of these.


1174
01:23:50.315 --> 01:23:52.691
-这是什么  -轻度安眠药

1175
01:23:53.151 --> 01:23:56.653
-第二天会没精神的  -睡不着也会这样
- They make you so groggy the next day. - So will no sleep.


1176
01:23:56.738 --> 01:23:58.072
半片就好
Just take half.


1177
01:23:58.406 --> 01:23:59.948
-是吗  -当然
- Really? - Sure.


1178
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.502
我不喜欢迈克尔在这样的天出去
I don't like Michael out in this.


1179
01:24:12.212 --> 01:24:14.505
那打给他让他回家
Well, let's call him and get him home.


1180
01:24:15.131 --> 01:24:18.344
没关系的  我已经不把他当小孩子看了
No, that's okay. I've just got to stop treating him like a child.


1181
01:24:28.186 --> 01:24:29.561
好了  待在这里  如果你看到任何动静
All right, stay here. If you see any movement


1182
01:24:29.646 --> 01:24:31.105
有人上楼或者下楼
upstairs or see anyone come downstairs,


1183
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:34.066
或者任何灯光  打给我  我调震动了
any lights, call me. I've got it on vibrate.


1184
01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:36.693
迈克尔  你要干吗
Well, Michael, what are you doing?


1185
01:24:38.029 --> 01:24:39.988
我要去看看那些储藏柜里到底有什么
