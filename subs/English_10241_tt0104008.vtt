00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:43.798
A WINTER'S TALE

2
00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:46.923
You're taking a risk.

3
00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.506
36, rue Victor Hugo.

4
00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.006
That's easy to remember.

5
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.506
In Courbevoie, 
I forget the code.

6
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.756
Never mind, it's right near Paris.

7
00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:25.714
I'll write to you when I arrive, OK?

8
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.006
Write to me, huh?

9
00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.923
<i>Town of Levallois.</i>

10
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.548
5 YEARS LATER

11
00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:33.214
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 14

12
00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:52.381
Felicie!

13
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.589
It's 8 a.m.

14
00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:59.506
Already!

15
00:05:01.757 --> 00:05:02.839
Morning.

16
00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:05.756
Come to Nicolas's tonight.

17
00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:08.256
I'm dining at Mum's.

18
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.048
And tomorrow I may go
to my sister's until Monday.


19
00:05:12.215 --> 00:05:14.173
OK, have a good day.

20
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.006
Thanks, you too.

21
00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:33.589
Sure. Happens every day.

22
00:07:36.174 --> 00:07:37.714
No, last night.

23
00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:42.923
You're right.

24
00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:49.964
I've really no cause for complaint.

25
00:07:53.715 --> 00:07:57.006
OK, Tuesday, then.

26
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.339
No, I thank you!

27
00:08:01.632 --> 00:08:02.714
Who was it?

28
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.631
What's happened?

29
00:08:07.632 --> 00:08:08.589
I've done it!

30
00:08:08.757 --> 00:08:10.464
Done what? Juliette gone?

31
00:08:10.632 --> 00:08:12.464
I'm going!

32
00:08:12.632 --> 00:08:16.381
I'll drive. I'm expected in 2 hours
for the inventory.


33
00:08:17.632 --> 00:08:21.464
Already? You didn't tell me!

34
00:08:21.715 --> 00:08:25.673
I found out last night.
I couldn't tell you on the phone.


35
00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:30.673
Besides, I was sure
you were with whatsit.


36
00:08:32.257 --> 00:08:35.964
I told you it'd happen
before New Year's, and it did.


37
00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:38.089
You'll come back when?

38
00:08:38.215 --> 00:08:40.464
I won't be back.
I'll stay down there.


39
00:08:41.507 --> 00:08:44.756
I can't close the shop
over the holidays.


40
00:08:51.715 --> 00:08:52.964
What about me?

41
00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:59.173
Take the appointments here
today and tomorrow.


42
00:08:59.924 --> 00:09:04.464
You must be here Tuesday
to receive the new manager.


43
00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:09.173
Then...
you join me soon as you can.


44
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.964
And my daughter?

45
00:09:12.132 --> 00:09:13.673
There are schools there.

46
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.589
With the Christmas vacations,
you've time to enroll her.


47
00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:22.923
Does Juliette know?

48
00:09:24.007 --> 00:09:27.548
I told her yesterday.

49
00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:29.839
She wasn't too...

50
00:09:30.507 --> 00:09:35.964
No. I thought she'd make a fuss,
but not at all,


51
00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:37.714
she threw me out.

52
00:09:37.882 --> 00:09:39.089
Good for her.

53
00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:44.298
I preferred that.
I packed up and drove to a hotel.


54
00:10:03.215 --> 00:10:06.381
Suppose I don't come?
You'll be alone.


55
00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:08.839
Why say that? You'll come.

56
00:10:09.007 --> 00:10:10.631
I haven't said yes.

57
00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:16.089
You wanted to leave Paris.
It's partly for you I'm moving.


58
00:10:17.549 --> 00:10:20.881
Partly. A small part.

59
00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:25.339
Don't put me on.

60
00:10:26.924 --> 00:10:28.548
You doubt my love!

61
00:10:28.674 --> 00:10:32.214
You doubt mine, so you don't trust me,
don't consult me.


62
00:10:32.424 --> 00:10:33.756
We talked for months!

63
00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:35.173
Only vaguely.

64
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.131
It wasn't vague to me.

65
00:10:37.924 --> 00:10:39.839
It was to me!

66
00:10:47.424 --> 00:10:48.673
You scared?

67
00:11:00.924 --> 00:11:03.881
I haven't said yes,
but I haven't said no.


68
00:11:08.215 --> 00:11:11.506
Since I have to make a decision...

69
00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:14.714
I'll say...yes!

70
00:11:21.007 --> 00:11:25.881
I'm surprised, too,
at how fast it's all happened.


71
00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:31.589
I wish we could leave together.

72
00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:36.173
I can't go before Christmas:
there's Elise, Mum, my sister...


73
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.964
I could come down for a look Sunday.
Is it far?


74
00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:43.423
A two-hour train ride.

75
00:11:44.257 --> 00:11:49.631
You leave Saturday night
and return Monday afternoon.


76
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.798
Why didn't I think of that?

77
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.381
Now I've got to run.

78
00:12:15.007 --> 00:12:17.131
You took your car. 
I hadn't seen.

79
00:12:18.132 --> 00:12:19.381
Don't catch cold.

80
00:12:20.424 --> 00:12:21.589
See you Saturday.

81
00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:26.881
Watch out for ice!

82
00:12:42.132 --> 00:12:43.673
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?


83
00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:47.381
- Am I too early?
- Not at all.


84
00:12:47.549 --> 00:12:49.173
Give me your coat.

85
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.464
We should already be open,
but the other girl's late.


86
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.714
Here's Armelle.

87
00:13:10.215 --> 00:13:12.923
- Shall I do highlights?
- If you like.


88
00:13:15.007 --> 00:13:16.631
Maxence has gone to Nevers.

89
00:13:17.174 --> 00:13:19.381
His new salon. 
He starts Tuesday.

90
00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:20.214
And you?

91
00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:22.714
I'm staying, for now. 
Tell you later.

92
00:13:22.882 --> 00:13:23.881
Maxence leaving?

93
00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:26.214
But the salon's not closing.

94
00:13:26.382 --> 00:13:27.673
You staying?

95
00:13:27.924 --> 00:13:29.964
No, I'm leaving.

96
00:14:28.382 --> 00:14:29.923
- Hi, Mum.
- Hello, dear.


97
00:14:30.132 --> 00:14:31.214
Elise in bed?

98
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.298
Just went.
Hurry, her light's still on.


99
00:14:44.132 --> 00:14:45.631
Give me a big kiss.

100
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.881
I have my big padaboom-boom-boom.

101
00:14:54.049 --> 00:14:56.339
I've finished sleeping.

102
00:14:56.674 --> 00:14:57.839
How'd today go?

103
00:14:58.049 --> 00:14:59.256
I played with Anna.

104
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.173
We played Daddy and Mummy,

105
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.048
yellow mouse,
pink mouse and green mouse,


106
00:15:06.465 --> 00:15:10.173
I played the mailman didn't come,
and the thief.


107
00:15:10.382 --> 00:15:12.964
Fine. Now you go sound asleep.

108
00:15:14.215 --> 00:15:17.214
- Lie down.
- I want the light out.


109
00:15:17.382 --> 00:15:20.673
Go to sleep
and we'll turn out the light.


110
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.839
What?

111
00:15:22.007 --> 00:15:23.756
To sleep, Elise.

112
00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:24.964
What?

113
00:15:27.965 --> 00:15:29.339
No tickling.

114
00:15:29.507 --> 00:15:31.714
Yes, tickle!

115
00:15:32.674 --> 00:15:36.923
Leave my rabbit or he'll hit you.

116
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.298
Alright.

117
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.423
I love my bunny!

118
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.756
Go to sleep, OK?

119
00:15:54.757 --> 00:15:59.256
It's not Christmas yet,
but I got stuck in traffic.


120
00:15:59.424 --> 00:16:04.423
Don't worry,
dinner will be ready in 5 minutes.


121
00:16:17.715 --> 00:16:21.673
Unless you're...going to Loic's.

122
00:16:21.757 --> 00:16:23.381
Not tonight.

123
00:16:25.465 --> 00:16:26.964
Besides,

124
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:34.589
I've made a decision.
You know Maxence is moving to Nevers.


125
00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.964
He left today.
I'm going to join him.


126
00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:40.798
Right away?

127
00:16:41.799 --> 00:16:44.589
I'm going Sunday to look it over
but I'll be back.


128
00:16:44.715 --> 00:16:47.548
After Christmas,
Elise and I go for good.


129
00:16:47.757 --> 00:16:50.464
I thought you and Max had split up.

130
00:16:50.757 --> 00:16:55.173
No, I waited until he quit living
with that woman.


131
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.381
You stayed at Loic's.

132
00:16:57.757 --> 00:17:01.339
To keep the steam up.
Why let him step on me?


133
00:17:04.382 --> 00:17:08.631
Felicie, don't talk like that!

134
00:17:08.757 --> 00:17:13.006
It's not what you feel,
and it's hard on Loic.


135
00:17:13.882 --> 00:17:15.214
He knows you're going?

136
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.589
I haven't told him.
I only found out this morning.


137
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.089
It's a matter of how to break it.

138
00:17:26.007 --> 00:17:27.756
He'll be shattered.

139
00:17:27.924 --> 00:17:29.923
I don't think so.

140
00:17:30.507 --> 00:17:34.423
He's always expected me
to leave him,


141
00:17:34.632 --> 00:17:35.964
that's nothing new.

142
00:17:36.965 --> 00:17:41.131
But it's no fun for me, either.
I'm sorry to leave Loic.


143
00:17:42.174 --> 00:17:44.923
In a way, I prefer him to Maxence.

144
00:17:46.757 --> 00:17:50.006
If I stayed here,
I'd want him as a friend,


145
00:17:50.382 --> 00:17:52.256
but he wouldn't accept that.

146
00:17:52.424 --> 00:17:55.923
He'd be right.
Why not marry him?


147
00:17:57.257 --> 00:17:59.798
You won't find a better man,

148
00:18:00.007 --> 00:18:03.089
he's crazy about you,

149
00:18:04.382 --> 00:18:07.923
Personally...I much prefer him

150
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.714
to your hairdresser.

151
00:18:10.049 --> 00:18:11.964
You, maybe, but not me.

152
00:18:12.382 --> 00:18:16.423
Loic's not my type,
physically or mentally.


153
00:18:16.632 --> 00:18:19.881
Mentally? What's wrong with him?

154
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.839
Nothing, but...
he's too much of an egghead.


155
00:18:25.215 --> 00:18:28.048
That's OK in a friend,
but I feel diminished.


156
00:18:28.715 --> 00:18:31.423
I dunno...he's too sweet.

157
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.923
Sweet men are nice. They're rare.

158
00:18:35.632 --> 00:18:37.714
Not as rare as you think.

159
00:18:38.632 --> 00:18:43.631
With your character,
you dislike being dominated.


160
00:18:45.007 --> 00:18:49.673
I do. I don't like people
I can blow over.


161
00:18:50.299 --> 00:18:54.173
I won't be dominated mentally,
but physically I like it.


162
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:59.964
I like strong men, not bookworms.

163
00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:02.173
Some men are both.

164
00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:04.381
I know.

165
00:19:04.924 --> 00:19:08.714
Charles knew a lot,
even more than Loic.


166
00:19:09.257 --> 00:19:13.964
But he learned it from life,
not from books.


167
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.464
Not Maxence.

168
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:18.964
Maxence...

169
00:19:20.299 --> 00:19:23.714
he has taste,
he likes beautiful things.


170
00:19:23.882 --> 00:19:27.048
He likes lovely women
and I like handsome men.


171
00:19:27.924 --> 00:19:33.131
For me, a man's beauty lies
in his intelligence.


172
00:19:33.257 --> 00:19:35.673
He's not as dumb as you think.

173
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.548
His intelligence is like Charles's,
but more rough hone.


174
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.006
Rough hewn.

175
00:19:42.465 --> 00:19:46.964
Hewn. See? Maybe I'm no sharper
than he is.


176
00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:52.089
SATURDAY, DECEMBER 15

177
00:19:58.632 --> 00:20:01.506
- You didn't bring much.
- For 2 days...


178
00:20:01.757 --> 00:20:02.964
You may stay on.

179
00:20:07.757 --> 00:20:09.464
This the old town?

180
00:20:09.715 --> 00:20:14.089
No, the shopping district.
The salon's on the corner.


181
00:20:28.174 --> 00:20:30.048
Terrific location.

182
00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:43.464
It's darling.

183
00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:51.339
It's chic!

184
00:20:55.924 --> 00:20:58.673
It's huge!

185
00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.756
Like it?

186
00:20:59.965 --> 00:21:04.173
It's fine. Room for at least

187
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.131
For now, we're only 3.

188
00:21:07.715 --> 00:21:09.464
We can decorate it later.

189
00:21:09.632 --> 00:21:14.506
I like it. 1900-style. Nice sinks.

190
00:21:14.674 --> 00:21:16.964
Infra-reds, too.

191
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.423
It's really equipped.

192
00:21:20.715 --> 00:21:24.548
That's not all. 
Come see the love nest.

193
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:31.048
I'll carry it.

194
00:21:32.049 --> 00:21:33.048
Go on up.

195
00:21:37.632 --> 00:21:39.173
I'm impressed.

196
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.131
I'll lead the way.

197
00:21:55.174 --> 00:21:56.506
It's roomy.

198
00:21:56.632 --> 00:21:59.006
- Like it?
- A lot. You've got furniture?


199
00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:03.548
They left some.
We can junk it if you want.


200
00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:07.048
No, it's comfortable.

201
00:22:11.507 --> 00:22:15.548
- Your books won't fill the shelves.
- We'll use knickknacks.


202
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.631
There are the closets.

203
00:22:24.007 --> 00:22:25.173
Handy.

204
00:22:26.632 --> 00:22:28.006
This is the kitchen.

205
00:22:29.215 --> 00:22:32.089
And here's the bedroom.

206
00:22:37.674 --> 00:22:39.839
I know, it's not your style.

207
00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.798
This is the room I'd paint first.

208
00:22:43.674 --> 00:22:45.256
We'll dump the cherubs.

209
00:22:50.465 --> 00:22:52.381
Aren't they cupids?

210
00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.423
SUNDAY, DECEMBER 16

211
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.131
No regrets?

212
00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:11.464
No.

213
00:23:12.674 --> 00:23:16.548
Antique ceramics...from Nevers.

214
00:23:18.424 --> 00:23:19.881
Beautiful.

215
00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:21.589
Those are cupids.

216
00:23:21.924 --> 00:23:22.714
Really?

217
00:23:22.882 --> 00:23:26.214
See the arrows? 
They're sons of Venus.

218
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:30.173
Isn't that the Venus by...
what's his name?


219
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.464
Botticelli.

220
00:23:32.049 --> 00:23:33.423
ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM.

221
00:23:34.465 --> 00:23:38.964
Look at these twisted jars.

222
00:23:39.132 --> 00:23:39.631
That's pretty.

223
00:23:41.007 --> 00:23:42.839
Like perfume jars.

224
00:23:43.299 --> 00:23:45.339
What's a reliquary?

225
00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:47.214
It's the glass coffin

226
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:50.548
that's used to exhibit her.

227
00:23:55.174 --> 00:23:57.131
She has a straight nose!

228
00:24:01.757 --> 00:24:02.964
"Street...

229
00:24:03.215 --> 00:24:04.006
"of pretty mittens"...

230
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.131
In the street of pretty mittens...

231
00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:10.548
There are pretty little kittens...

232
00:24:11.132 --> 00:24:12.548
But no stray cats!

233
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.506
I've got my little kitten.

234
00:24:16.882 --> 00:24:19.048
And me my big tomcat.

235
00:24:23.465 --> 00:24:24.589
I love you.

236
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:31.339
In the street of pretty mittens...

237
00:24:31.632 --> 00:24:32.881
"Break-neck street".

238
00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.006
Beautiful walls.

239
00:24:35.132 --> 00:24:36.923
I love them.

240
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.464
Up we go!

241
00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:42.881
Don't run.

242
00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:43.839
I'm not.

243
00:24:44.007 --> 00:24:44.881
I'm worn out.

244
00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.214
Come on!

245
00:24:48.507 --> 00:24:51.673
Lovely. The Loire River?

246
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.881
Before the bridge was built,
a patrol helped pilgrims across.


247
00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:05.464
They walked across?

248
00:25:05.632 --> 00:25:06.673
Sure.

249
00:25:07.007 --> 00:25:07.714
What's that...

250
00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:08.714
...tower?

251
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:12.339
Part of the old walls. 
Shall we go see?

252
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:34.506
What's weird is he never gave you
his address.


253
00:25:34.757 --> 00:25:39.673
He was offered several restaurants,
and had to go inspect them.


254
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.256
He must've lived somewhere.

255
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.756
I don't know.

256
00:25:46.049 --> 00:25:48.464
He didn't say where he was going?

257
00:25:48.632 --> 00:25:51.881
Yes, but I forgot.
It's not a familiar name.


258
00:25:52.049 --> 00:25:54.173
I just know it's in America.

259
00:25:54.299 --> 00:25:55.589
North?

260
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.381
I assume so.

261
00:26:02.215 --> 00:26:04.464
Maybe it was South America.

262
00:26:05.215 --> 00:26:07.839
No, it was the United States.

263
00:26:10.174 --> 00:26:13.839
North or South, I didn't care,
I'd have followed him anywhere.


264
00:26:14.257 --> 00:26:18.923
I never thought
I could louse up my address.


265
00:26:19.257 --> 00:26:21.089
How dumb can you be?

266
00:26:22.757 --> 00:26:24.839
You didn't know where you lived?

267
00:26:25.007 --> 00:26:29.089
Yes, but I wrote one word for another,
as I often do.


268
00:26:29.424 --> 00:26:31.256
What's that called?

269
00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:34.131
- A slip of the tongue.
- That's it, a slip.


270
00:26:34.507 --> 00:26:37.714
I meant Levallois,
and I said Courbevoie.


271
00:26:37.924 --> 00:26:40.048
Why? It just happened.

272
00:26:40.215 --> 00:26:41.464
Think so?

273
00:26:41.632 --> 00:26:44.631
I noticed it 6 months later.

274
00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:48.714
I made the same slip
on the maternity-clinic forms.


275
00:26:48.882 --> 00:26:51.839
That's when I knew
I gave him a bum address.


276
00:26:52.007 --> 00:26:55.464
Before that,
you thought he'd forgotten you?


277
00:26:55.632 --> 00:26:58.881
No, I thought he was dead.

278
00:26:59.424 --> 00:27:03.089
Never thought of getting rid
of the child?


279
00:27:03.424 --> 00:27:07.548
It never occurred to me.
It's against my convictions.


280
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.464
Not religious convictions...

281
00:27:12.299 --> 00:27:15.006
Religion and I don't get along...

282
00:27:15.215 --> 00:27:18.298
But convictions that are...

283
00:27:18.507 --> 00:27:20.131
Personal...

284
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.298
Intimate, I'd say.

285
00:27:23.132 --> 00:27:27.881
That's it, intimate.
I dislike what's contrary to nature.


286
00:27:28.382 --> 00:27:32.506
I'd lost Charles, but...
I had his child.


287
00:27:32.674 --> 00:27:36.298
A child and some photos.
He had neither.


288
00:27:36.424 --> 00:27:38.798
I bet he thought you'd dumped him.

289
00:27:39.215 --> 00:27:40.214
No.

290
00:27:40.382 --> 00:27:44.048
He must have,
if you gave him a false address.


291
00:27:44.257 --> 00:27:46.381
I know what he thought!

292
00:27:47.965 --> 00:27:50.964
It's an assumption,
but as good as yours!


293
00:27:51.507 --> 00:27:53.173
What'd he think?

294
00:27:53.757 --> 00:27:58.839
When I realized my slip,
I was pregnant but still working.


295
00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.714
When my Levallois house
was condemned,


296
00:28:01.882 --> 00:28:03.964
I moved to Mum's.

297
00:28:04.215 --> 00:28:06.506
I went to the post office
in Courbevoie.


298
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:10.423
They were nice enough,
but knew nothing.


299
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.756
They keep no records.

300
00:28:13.132 --> 00:28:16.798
If there's no return address,
they throw it out.


301
00:28:16.924 --> 00:28:18.464
And general delivery?

302
00:28:18.632 --> 00:28:21.006
I tried it, thanks. Nothing.

303
00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:25.714
I noticed there was also
a Victor Hugo St. in Courbevoie.


304
00:28:26.132 --> 00:28:29.923
I went there,
in case someone found a letter.


305
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.506
And guess what!

306
00:28:32.007 --> 00:28:35.256
I dunno. There was no such number?

307
00:28:35.424 --> 00:28:38.423
There had been a No.36,

308
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.339
but it was being demolished, too.

309
00:28:41.507 --> 00:28:44.798
I figured if Charles
had looked for me...


310
00:28:44.965 --> 00:28:47.464
and I'm certain he did...

311
00:28:47.632 --> 00:28:52.381
he'd think it wasn't my fault
that his letter was returned!


312
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:54.964
That's assuming a lot.

313
00:28:55.132 --> 00:28:57.131
It's perfectly logical.

314
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:59.673
Anyway, it gave me courage.

315
00:29:00.215 --> 00:29:04.756
When I met Loic, the following year,
he really helped me.


316
00:29:04.924 --> 00:29:09.756
He wrote to lots of organizations,
but I had a major handicap:


317
00:29:09.965 --> 00:29:11.673
I didn't know his name.

318
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:13.464
His last name?

319
00:29:13.632 --> 00:29:16.381
At the restaurant he was Charles.

320
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:19.381
He was moonlighting, so no pay slip.

321
00:29:19.632 --> 00:29:22.173
He had a Danish or Dutch name,

322
00:29:22.382 --> 00:29:27.923
with an "en" in it
or an "er"...den, den, der...


323
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.964
He knew your name.

324
00:29:30.424 --> 00:29:31.756
So what?

325
00:29:34.174 --> 00:29:36.131
I always live with someone.

326
00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:39.798
Mum uses her maiden name,
my sisters married.


327
00:29:40.007 --> 00:29:42.298
I'm the girl no one can find.

328
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:46.423
Poor kid. You were really out of luck.

329
00:29:46.674 --> 00:29:49.673
I was dumb!

330
00:29:50.757 --> 00:29:52.006
Stark, raving dumb!

331
00:29:52.174 --> 00:29:53.589
Stark, raving mad.

332
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:57.673
We don't say "stark, raving dumb".

333
00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.298
See, I'm inarticulate.

334
00:29:59.465 --> 00:30:01.298
It can happen to anyone.

335
00:30:06.007 --> 00:30:09.964
All that's over,
I don't want to dwell on it.


336
00:30:10.132 --> 00:30:13.756
Forget it.
I want to think only of you.


337
00:30:14.799 --> 00:30:16.756
I want to love only you.

338
00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.881
You want to love me?

339
00:30:21.965 --> 00:30:24.048
Don't ask too much of me now.

340
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.589
I love you,
but I want to love you more.


341
00:30:29.007 --> 00:30:30.423
A little more.

342
00:30:31.007 --> 00:30:32.173
A little?

343
00:30:32.632 --> 00:30:35.923
Yes, it won't take much,

344
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.589
but it can'tjust come, right away.

345
00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.756
Rely on me. I'm patient. I can wait.

346
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.048
I understand, I won't push.

347
00:30:51.132 --> 00:30:52.548
Trust me?

348
00:30:52.715 --> 00:30:55.548
Yes, or I wouldn't be here.

349
00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:14.756
MONDAY, DECEMBER 17.

350
00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:17.089
It's me!

351
00:31:17.257 --> 00:31:19.173
Mummy's here.

352
00:31:28.132 --> 00:31:29.798
Flowers.

353
00:31:31.132 --> 00:31:32.923
Pretty, is that for me?

354
00:31:33.382 --> 00:31:35.423
- It's for Mummy.
- For everyone.


355
00:31:36.757 --> 00:31:40.631
That, that and that, for everyone.

356
00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:42.631
That's a princess.

357
00:31:42.757 --> 00:31:47.339
It's a doll with
a crown on her head.

358
00:31:47.507 --> 00:31:49.964
I see the crown.

359
00:31:51.757 --> 00:31:54.589
Your mind still made up?

360
00:31:54.715 --> 00:31:58.839
More than ever. It's nice there.
Elise will like it.


361
00:31:59.799 --> 00:32:01.006
When do you leave?

362
00:32:01.174 --> 00:32:05.089
Right after Christmas.
I have to stay to hand things over.


363
00:32:05.882 --> 00:32:07.798
I'll be swamped in work.

364
00:32:08.715 --> 00:32:13.423
I must see Loic tomorrow night.
That's the most urgent.


365
00:32:15.007 --> 00:32:19.173
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 18.

366
00:32:19.674 --> 00:32:22.714
...I'm not partisan.
He sure doesn't favor women...


367
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.881
"You're morally unfit
for marriage", he says.


368
00:32:26.049 --> 00:32:27.923
Men and women are the same.

369
00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:29.673
- OK, but he...
- They're equal...


370
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.048
Not all of them,
he still protects Ricky, says


371
00:32:33.174 --> 00:32:35.881
he's "physically unfit for marriage".

372
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:41.464
Because he limps...And he says
"Women assert nature's rights,


373
00:32:41.882 --> 00:32:46.589
"but nature's not worth a hoot,
or maybe just a whimper."


374
00:32:51.299 --> 00:32:53.256
We're having a discussion.

375
00:32:53.424 --> 00:32:55.048
Felicie, meet Quentin.

376
00:32:56.215 --> 00:32:58.464
Have you read
"The Longest Journey"?


377
00:32:59.632 --> 00:33:02.839
I read it so long ago
I've forgotten it.


378
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:06.881
You haven't,
we were just talking about it.


379
00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:10.048
Their discussion
about the cow and reality.


380
00:33:10.257 --> 00:33:14.714
When he strikes a match,
they're in the room in Cambridge,


381
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.339
and a character mentions a cow...

382
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:19.673
That's philosophy... There's more

383
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.131
in the book than that.

384
00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:22.464
It's important

385
00:33:22.674 --> 00:33:25.631
to explore the existence of reality.

386
00:33:25.924 --> 00:33:29.506
- So you saw that?
- He says so in Chapter 1 .


387
00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:32.381
But how do you see Ricky,

388
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:35.006
who will experience reality?

389
00:33:35.174 --> 00:33:38.714
Ricky appears gradually in the story,

390
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.589
first against the philosophical tale
at the start...


391
00:33:43.757 --> 00:33:45.673
So you think he's the...

392
00:33:47.299 --> 00:33:48.339
The key character.

393
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:49.714
Not to me.

394
00:33:50.715 --> 00:33:54.673
Leave it, Felicie,
I'll take care of it.


395
00:33:59.465 --> 00:34:00.631
You OK?

396
00:34:00.882 --> 00:34:02.089
I'm fine.

397
00:34:02.257 --> 00:34:03.673
Can we help?

398
00:34:03.799 --> 00:34:07.589
No, thanks, Edwige. 
Dinner's ready.

399
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:14.464
We've all lived
an incalculable number of lives.


400
00:34:16.132 --> 00:34:16.756
Think so?

401
00:34:16.965 --> 00:34:20.589
I'm certain.
You're at least in your 500th life.


402
00:34:20.757 --> 00:34:22.548
500's impossible.

403
00:34:22.715 --> 00:34:26.923
How do you know?
You're notjust some mineral growth,


404
00:34:27.132 --> 00:34:31.048
you didn't reach your spiritual level

405
00:34:31.257 --> 00:34:33.923
in only a few years,

406
00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:35.798
3 or 4 lives.

407
00:34:35.965 --> 00:34:38.839
But I did!
Cats have nine lives...


408
00:34:39.007 --> 00:34:40.839
It's a maximum for us.

409
00:34:41.007 --> 00:34:44.756
Maybe you were a cat, right, Loic?

410
00:34:45.257 --> 00:34:48.756
If one can believe such things...

411
00:34:48.965 --> 00:34:51.214
Edwige always goes overboard.

412
00:34:51.382 --> 00:34:53.964
Loic, you're one Catholic

413
00:34:54.132 --> 00:34:56.798
who rejects the supernatural.

414
00:34:56.965 --> 00:35:00.548
That's not supernatural,
it's superstition.


415
00:35:00.715 --> 00:35:02.173
It's not superstition.

416
00:35:02.924 --> 00:35:05.881
There's no difference between
your supernatural and mine.


417
00:35:06.715 --> 00:35:09.423
You make one, but backwards.

418
00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:14.298
You buy the supernatural in everything
but Christianity, and get suckered.


419
00:35:14.507 --> 00:35:15.464
By whom?

420
00:35:15.632 --> 00:35:17.048
Charlatans.

421
00:35:18.007 --> 00:35:22.756
No charlatan has suckered me.
I don't belong to a sect.


422
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.756
I have no guru.

423
00:35:25.174 --> 00:35:28.839
I don't give away money.
I buy books, but only in a sale.


424
00:35:29.007 --> 00:35:32.423
You're hooked by the charlatanism
of the Church.


425
00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.839
You accept the miracle of Lourdes

426
00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:37.631
but reject my ideas.

427
00:35:37.715 --> 00:35:41.506
My faith doesn't rest on miracles.
I may not be


428
00:35:41.674 --> 00:35:43.256
a perfect Catholic,

429
00:35:43.549 --> 00:35:45.006
but they turn me off.

430
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.673
Yet you're a believer?

431
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.756
Of course.

432
00:35:48.674 --> 00:35:52.089
Without the supernatural,
there's no religion.


433
00:35:52.632 --> 00:35:55.256
Your supernatural isn't real.

434
00:35:55.715 --> 00:35:58.339
What's real supernaturalism?

435
00:35:58.507 --> 00:36:01.131
Yours is magic, not religion.

436
00:36:01.465 --> 00:36:03.964
Magic? All religions have believed

437
00:36:04.132 --> 00:36:07.256
in reincarnation.
It's compatible with...


438
00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:08.298
...Christianity.

439
00:36:08.507 --> 00:36:10.673
- I say it isn't.
- Why not?


440
00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.339
It's not a moral idea.
It eliminates responsibility.


441
00:36:14.507 --> 00:36:17.256
You can only be responsible
for one life.


442
00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:21.006
You'll never shed your moralism.

443
00:36:21.257 --> 00:36:23.381
Why should I?

444
00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:25.631
I disagree.

445
00:36:26.507 --> 00:36:31.214
If a spirit lives in many bodies,

446
00:36:32.507 --> 00:36:35.839
it gradually grows perfect.

447
00:36:36.049 --> 00:36:38.006
Responsibility is preserved.

448
00:36:38.215 --> 00:36:41.798
That sounds fine,
but to me it's meaningless.


449
00:36:42.424 --> 00:36:43.589
I know, I'm ignorant.

450
00:36:43.757 --> 00:36:47.006
He's the ignorant one!
He can't see


451
00:36:47.299 --> 00:36:49.589
beyond the Gospels.

452
00:36:49.882 --> 00:36:54.214
All great minds have believed
in metempsychosis, meaning


453
00:36:54.382 --> 00:36:55.506
reincarnation.

454
00:36:55.674 --> 00:36:58.923
Including poets. Victor Hugo:

455
00:36:59.132 --> 00:37:02.173
"So a beast comes and goes,

456
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.339
"Roars, screams, bites.

457
00:37:05.507 --> 00:37:08.756
"A tree is there,
its branches bristling,


458
00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:10.881
"A paving stone collapses

459
00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:14.256
"In the road that carts crush
and winter ruins.


460
00:37:14.424 --> 00:37:17.131
"Under those thicknesses of matter

461
00:37:17.299 --> 00:37:22.131
"and of night, tree, beast, stone,
weight that nothing raises,


462
00:37:22.882 --> 00:37:26.131
"In that terrible depth,

463
00:37:26.299 --> 00:37:28.548
"A soul dreams.

464
00:37:29.215 --> 00:37:32.173
"What does it do?
It dreams of God."


465
00:37:32.424 --> 00:37:33.964
Well done!

466
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.839
When will we meet again?

467
00:37:39.007 --> 00:37:41.089
After the holidays.

468
00:37:41.257 --> 00:37:44.589
If you like. Well, good karma!

469
00:37:44.715 --> 00:37:46.089
Happy Karmic year.

470
00:37:46.924 --> 00:37:47.964
Your purse.

471
00:37:48.174 --> 00:37:49.423
My purse!

472
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.048
Happy new year.

473
00:37:51.257 --> 00:37:51.964
And to you.

474
00:37:52.132 --> 00:37:53.548
Karmic or not.

475
00:37:53.715 --> 00:37:54.964
It will be.

476
00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:57.506
Take care, Felicie.

477
00:37:59.882 --> 00:38:02.173
Have fun, you two.

478
00:38:11.632 --> 00:38:14.798
You didn't expect a crowd.
Were you bored?


479
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:20.089
I tried to tell you on the phone,
but you hung up.


480
00:38:20.257 --> 00:38:23.756
Sorry, I had a customer.
I'd have come anyway.


481
00:38:24.049 --> 00:38:26.589
I had something important to say.

482
00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.006
Very important.

483
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.548
What?

484
00:38:31.882 --> 00:38:34.089
Something that couldn't wait.

485
00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.256
So spit it out.

486
00:38:40.674 --> 00:38:42.673
I've reached a decision.

487
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:46.756
What decision?

488
00:38:49.382 --> 00:38:53.464
Wait, making a decision
is not always easy.


489
00:38:53.674 --> 00:38:57.714
There are pros and cons.
Then you decide because you must.


490
00:38:58.049 --> 00:38:59.548
Come on, tell me!

491
00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:04.756
I'm leaving with Maxence.

492
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.214
For his hick town?

493
00:39:08.132 --> 00:39:09.381
He has his beauty salon.

494
00:39:09.715 --> 00:39:12.964
It's no hick town.
Nevers is big. Know it?


495
00:39:13.132 --> 00:39:17.131
Yeah, you told me, it's his home town.

496
00:39:18.132 --> 00:39:19.756
He's dumped that woman?

497
00:39:20.465 --> 00:39:22.048
I hope so.

498
00:39:25.132 --> 00:39:26.506
You hope!

499
00:39:27.007 --> 00:39:30.089
An expression.
You know it ended long ago.


500
00:39:30.674 --> 00:39:31.714
And Elise?

501
00:39:31.882 --> 00:39:33.256
She'll go with us.

502
00:39:33.424 --> 00:39:34.714
When do you leave?

503
00:39:35.424 --> 00:39:37.506
Me, in a week. 
He's already gone.

504
00:39:38.132 --> 00:39:41.714
So soon?
And you're only telling me now?


505
00:39:42.132 --> 00:39:44.714
You act first and tell me later.

506
00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:48.173
You needn't have told me.
Why'd you bother to come?


507
00:39:49.549 --> 00:39:53.964
He told me about it Friday morning
and left at once.


508
00:39:54.174 --> 00:39:58.506
I went there Saturday to visit him,
and got back last night.


509
00:39:58.882 --> 00:40:01.923
I guessed from your message
something was up.


510
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.548
You're not a good liar.

511
00:40:05.715 --> 00:40:07.298
I didn't lie. I said

512
00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.173
I wasn't sure I was free.

513
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.256
Not for the same reasons.
Anyway, you've known for 5 days!


514
00:40:14.465 --> 00:40:19.256
I couldn't say it on the phone.
I wanted to break it to you gently,


515
00:40:19.507 --> 00:40:22.631
now I've had to spring it
on you at bedtime.


516
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.339
Sorry, I loused it up.

517
00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.839
I'd like us to split up peacefully,

518
00:40:45.465 --> 00:40:50.589
since we'll remain friends...
even if we see little of each other.


519
00:40:57.465 --> 00:41:01.173
You're opposed, it hurts me
to leave you, too, but I must.


520
00:41:01.382 --> 00:41:05.506
You don't have to live
with a man you don't love!


521
00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.673
I love Maxence!

522
00:41:09.632 --> 00:41:10.673
I always told you I did.

523
00:41:10.965 --> 00:41:15.881
That's why I insisted he leave that girl,
since he said it was over.


524
00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:17.798
You never told me.

525
00:41:17.965 --> 00:41:19.381
I'm telling you now!

526
00:41:19.674 --> 00:41:21.214
That's new.

527
00:41:22.799 --> 00:41:25.881
You said you loved only
your daughter's father.


528
00:41:26.132 --> 00:41:28.714
There's love and love.

529
00:41:32.465 --> 00:41:35.256
I loved Charles, still do, totally.

530
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.214
I love Maxence another way.

531
00:41:39.757 --> 00:41:41.298
I love you, too.

532
00:41:41.507 --> 00:41:42.964
It's not real love.

533
00:41:43.757 --> 00:41:46.006
It's not real with Maxence, either!

534
00:41:46.174 --> 00:41:49.464
Making love with him doesn't mean
I love him...


535
00:41:49.632 --> 00:41:51.673
I don't know if you see.

536
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.881
I love him as a
man I can live with

537
00:41:55.049 --> 00:41:59.173
even if I'd rather live
with someone else who's absent.


538
00:42:00.049 --> 00:42:03.339
Many women would rather live
with some other man,


539
00:42:03.507 --> 00:42:05.631
but he's not real, he's a dream.

540
00:42:05.799 --> 00:42:08.089
For me, the dream was reality.

541
00:42:08.632 --> 00:42:11.423
An absent reality.

542
00:42:15.882 --> 00:42:20.006
Listen, perhaps I'm going
because of Charles,


543
00:42:20.257 --> 00:42:24.006
so that he'll be just a dream,
maybe that's better.


544
00:42:27.674 --> 00:42:32.673
I thought I saw Charles
in the street Friday.


545
00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:33.964
You thought?

546
00:42:34.465 --> 00:42:38.423
I'm sure it wasn't him,
but I have visions.


547
00:42:38.632 --> 00:42:43.006
There's a tiny chance I might find him
in Paris: it obsesses me.


548
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:48.339
In Nevers, there's no hope,
so my mind's free.


549
00:42:48.507 --> 00:42:53.006
Who knows, he might go there,
just like you?


550
00:42:53.465 --> 00:42:56.173
Don't put ideas in my head.

551
00:43:01.924 --> 00:43:04.339
I can get a
job in the sticks, too.

552
00:43:06.965 --> 00:43:09.881
You mustn't sacrifice yourself for me.

553
00:43:10.215 --> 00:43:14.798
It's no sacrifice if I'm with you.
Nothing else matters.


554
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.964
You need a woman who loves you
as you love her.


555
00:43:20.132 --> 00:43:23.006
I'll never love you enough.
You know that.


556
00:43:23.174 --> 00:43:27.256
Go with your Maxence,
he loves you and you love him!


557
00:43:28.299 --> 00:43:30.631
I sincerely wish you happiness.

558
00:43:31.882 --> 00:43:33.131
Loic!

559
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:45.714
Stop it! I hate sympathy!

560
00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:51.964
If we're breaking up, let's do it fast,
I was getting my hopes up.


561
00:43:52.424 --> 00:43:54.589
Better a clean break.

562
00:43:54.757 --> 00:43:56.506
Listen, Loic,

563
00:43:57.215 --> 00:44:00.589
I'm sad, maybe sadder than you.

564
00:44:00.757 --> 00:44:02.173
Sure!

565
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.256
I'll miss you as a friend.
I can't replace you.


566
00:44:13.007 --> 00:44:18.214
But you won't miss me long
as a woman, I hope.


567
00:44:20.674 --> 00:44:25.339
If I'm here, you won't meet
the love of your life. She exists.


568
00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:33.173
You're lucky I'm leaving.
I'm not kidding.


569
00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:36.173
I mean it
from the bottom of my heart.


570
00:44:36.632 --> 00:44:41.256
I believe you mean it
from the bottom of your heart.


571
00:44:43.007 --> 00:44:44.673
Know why I love you?

572
00:44:46.882 --> 00:44:51.256
Because you're beautiful,
but that's not enough.


573
00:44:53.007 --> 00:44:54.173
Why?

574
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:57.298
Because I feel I can read your heart.

575
00:44:58.132 --> 00:45:00.673
One can rarely read people's hearts.

576
00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.881
Sometimes I lie.

577
00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:07.839
Not about important things.

578
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.131
I won't find that in another woman.

579
00:45:12.507 --> 00:45:13.673
Don't say that.

580
00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.839
Why?

581
00:45:15.174 --> 00:45:17.714
It'll keep you
from loving someone else.


582
00:45:20.132 --> 00:45:24.173
Then you'll be to me
what Charles is to you.


583
00:45:25.132 --> 00:45:28.298
Don't joke about Charles.
That's different.


584
00:45:28.465 --> 00:45:30.881
You don't love me
as much as I did him.


585
00:45:31.049 --> 00:45:34.256
and I don't love you a tenth
as much as he did me.


586
00:45:44.757 --> 00:45:46.423
I don't want to go home.

587
00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:50.464
Can I sleep upstairs?

588
00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:53.256
I'll go up, it's unheated.
You stay here.


589
00:45:53.424 --> 00:45:57.589
No, I'm going up.
Don't fuss, I'm warm-blooded.


590
00:46:00.299 --> 00:46:01.798
As you wish.

591
00:46:03.965 --> 00:46:05.464
No kiss?

592
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:22.756
Sleep well.

593
00:46:23.299 --> 00:46:24.464
I'll try.

594
00:46:39.424 --> 00:46:41.214
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 25

595
00:46:41.674 --> 00:46:43.673
Felicie'll be away
for Jan. 1?


596
00:46:44.299 --> 00:46:46.714
- Here's the Yule log...
- There's a squirrel.


597
00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.964
Want the squirrel?

598
00:46:49.132 --> 00:46:50.631
And the Christmas tree.

599
00:46:50.799 --> 00:46:53.964
There's a Santa Claus.

600
00:46:54.132 --> 00:46:55.923
You want a Santa Claus, too?

601
00:46:59.674 --> 00:47:01.756
I know he's here.

602
00:47:01.965 --> 00:47:03.339
There he is!

603
00:47:07.757 --> 00:47:09.381
This interest you?

604
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:11.923
No, but I'll give it to Coralie.

605
00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.131
Taking that with you?

606
00:47:19.299 --> 00:47:20.298
Yes, why not?

607
00:47:20.507 --> 00:47:22.631
Your boyfriend might not like it.

608
00:47:22.757 --> 00:47:25.589
Too bad. It's none of his business.

609
00:47:25.757 --> 00:47:29.048
Elise has a right
to her father's photo in her room.


610
00:47:29.215 --> 00:47:31.381
Maybe, I dunno.

611
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:32.131
What?

612
00:47:32.299 --> 00:47:35.131
Should you tell her so much
about her father,


613
00:47:35.299 --> 00:47:38.131
now that she's getting
a foster father?


614
00:47:38.382 --> 00:47:40.589
She knows he's not her real Dad.

615
00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:44.506
I'm lucky to have the picture,
so why hide it?


616
00:47:44.757 --> 00:47:47.589
A child should know
what her Dad's like.


617
00:47:47.757 --> 00:47:49.589
But he's disappeared.

618
00:47:49.757 --> 00:47:53.464
He could reappear, maybe after I die.

619
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.714
You can't count on that, as you know.

620
00:47:56.882 --> 00:48:01.714
You give her false hopes.
It's frustrating for a kid.


621
00:48:02.007 --> 00:48:04.631
Hope's better than nothing.

622
00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:07.339
Then she can tell the kids in school,

623
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:10.589
"I have a daddy, too, he's away,
but he's handsome..."


624
00:48:10.757 --> 00:48:14.298
At her age,
she can't tell if a man's handsome.


625
00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:18.714
Yes, she can. She knows Charles
is handsomer than Loic.


626
00:48:18.882 --> 00:48:20.089
She tell you that?

627
00:48:20.257 --> 00:48:24.006
I told her, and she believes me.

628
00:48:24.757 --> 00:48:27.006
You're overdoing it.

629
00:48:27.174 --> 00:48:29.756
She believes me because she knows.

630
00:48:29.924 --> 00:48:33.089
I don't think Loic is bad-looking.

631
00:48:33.549 --> 00:48:35.214
I prefer Loic to him.

632
00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.798
A matter of taste.

633
00:48:40.382 --> 00:48:44.714
Handsome or not, 
Loic's not my style.

634
00:48:45.424 --> 00:48:50.589
I love nothing about him,
the whole or the parts.


635
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:56.506
I don't love his nose,
his eyes or his mouth.


636
00:48:56.715 --> 00:48:59.131
Your nose is rather like his.

637
00:48:59.257 --> 00:49:03.756
Yes, and I've always hated my nose.

638
00:49:03.965 --> 00:49:05.714
Yours is straighter.

639
00:49:06.299 --> 00:49:10.839
If Loic and I had kids,
our noses would add up to a horror.


640
00:49:11.799 --> 00:49:14.964
I have proof...

641
00:49:15.632 --> 00:49:18.423
No, a sign that I don't love him.

642
00:49:18.632 --> 00:49:23.589
I wouldn't want children with him,
but I could with Maxence.


643
00:49:24.674 --> 00:49:26.839
I don't know, we'll see.

644
00:49:28.049 --> 00:49:30.756
- What is it?
- Nothing, I just said "Ah".


645
00:49:30.924 --> 00:49:33.881
Anyway, I've hardly seen
your hairdresser.


646
00:49:34.049 --> 00:49:37.256
To you he's beefy.
But I don't like skinny men.


647
00:49:37.465 --> 00:49:39.714
I like 'em well-padded.

648
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.339
I can't say he's bad, he's just too...

649
00:49:44.507 --> 00:49:45.589
Too handsome?

650
00:49:45.757 --> 00:49:47.089
Too pretty boy.

651
00:49:47.257 --> 00:49:48.881
What's wrong with that?

652
00:49:49.049 --> 00:49:50.464
He's too regular.

653
00:49:50.632 --> 00:49:53.923
I like classic beauty.

654
00:49:54.132 --> 00:49:58.256
Don't forget I'm a beautician.
Beauty's my business.


655
00:49:58.424 --> 00:50:00.214
He's too like a male model.

656
00:50:00.424 --> 00:50:02.548
Say it, like an after-shave ad!

657
00:50:02.674 --> 00:50:07.214
I didn't mean that.
More like the sailor of my dreams.


658
00:50:07.382 --> 00:50:08.923
He's no sailor, he's a cook.

659
00:50:09.049 --> 00:50:11.381
In a grand hotel.

660
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:14.089
No, in good little restaurants.

661
00:50:16.882 --> 00:50:19.256
My Prince Charming is a cook.

662
00:50:22.757 --> 00:50:27.423
If I'd saved enough money

663
00:50:27.632 --> 00:50:30.673
I could check
every restaurant in America.


664
00:50:30.757 --> 00:50:32.339
No chance of that now?

665
00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:35.589
Now I've made my choice.
Good or bad,


666
00:50:35.799 --> 00:50:37.923
I don't know, but I had to choose.

667
00:50:38.132 --> 00:50:39.839
You don't know?

668
00:50:40.049 --> 00:50:44.173
If you know, then it's not a choice.
There's always a risk.


669
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.589
Therefore, go slow.

670
00:50:46.799 --> 00:50:49.173
You decided in a flash.

671
00:50:52.132 --> 00:50:53.214
You like it there?

672
00:50:54.174 --> 00:50:58.839
Yeah...I couldn't really judge,
it was Sunday.


673
00:50:58.965 --> 00:51:02.798
But Nevers is a big, lively city.

674
00:51:03.799 --> 00:51:07.089
You can still change your mind,
you're not gone yet.


675
00:51:07.257 --> 00:51:09.131
Why would I change my mind?

676
00:51:09.757 --> 00:51:11.756
You don't seem very fired-up.

677
00:51:11.965 --> 00:51:13.256
About the city?

678
00:51:13.465 --> 00:51:15.631
The city or the guy.

679
00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:18.714
A guy fired me up once.
That's enough.


680
00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:24.506
I feel you chose Maxence over Loic,
not the guy himself.


681
00:51:24.674 --> 00:51:27.589
That's your imagination.

682
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:32.173
I was crazy about Charles,
I'm sad to drop Loic,


683
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.006
and I'll be happy with Maxence.

684
00:51:37.174 --> 00:51:42.423
Life will be peaceful with him.
I really need that.


685
00:51:43.424 --> 00:51:46.673
Nevers is 149 miles from Paris,
I can visit you.


686
00:51:46.799 --> 00:51:50.214
You can visit us.
We'll tour the area.


687
00:51:51.299 --> 00:51:53.464
WESDNESDAY, DECEMBER 26

688
00:51:59.007 --> 00:52:01.423
He's not here, we'll take a cab.

689
00:52:12.924 --> 00:52:13.881
Wait.

690
00:52:14.257 --> 00:52:15.839
With you in a minute.

691
00:52:20.882 --> 00:52:22.589
Had a good trip?

692
00:52:22.757 --> 00:52:26.339
You alright, Elise?
Give Maxence a kiss.


693
00:52:28.257 --> 00:52:29.506
We'll put that there.

694
00:52:29.715 --> 00:52:30.756
Let's go up.

695
00:52:33.257 --> 00:52:35.589
Sorry, I'm busy
for another 15 minutes.


696
00:52:36.132 --> 00:52:38.214
I could've come, but...
Forgive me?


697
00:52:38.382 --> 00:52:40.964
Doesn't matter. Come upstairs, Elise.

698
00:52:55.174 --> 00:52:57.756
This is Maxence's and Mommy's room.

699
00:53:01.132 --> 00:53:02.923
I'll show you yours.

700
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:10.631
See your big bed?

701
00:53:12.215 --> 00:53:13.506
Like it?

702
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:22.423
What's the matter?

703
00:53:30.715 --> 00:53:32.964
Mind living over a beauty salon?

704
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:35.464
No, we have our apartment.

705
00:53:35.674 --> 00:53:37.756
It'll be nice and quiet...

706
00:53:57.924 --> 00:53:59.756
I'd have carved the chicken.

707
00:53:59.924 --> 00:54:02.381
No problem. It's easy.

708
00:54:04.632 --> 00:54:05.339
You OK?

709
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.714
I just didn't expect company.

710
00:54:11.257 --> 00:54:12.839
I could've helped you.

711
00:54:16.507 --> 00:54:20.089
Leave it! Take that in.

712
00:54:29.215 --> 00:54:32.589
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 27.

713
00:54:34.132 --> 00:54:35.464
Thanks, Madam.

714
00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:37.006
Call me Felicie.

715
00:54:37.215 --> 00:54:41.048
No, call her Madam, she's the boss.

716
00:54:56.049 --> 00:54:57.881
I've an appointment.

717
00:54:59.632 --> 00:55:02.631
Michelle, I'm going up.

718
00:55:05.215 --> 00:55:06.464
I'll be back.

719
00:55:14.215 --> 00:55:15.464
You OK?

720
00:55:17.257 --> 00:55:18.506
What's wrong?

721
00:55:18.799 --> 00:55:20.673
Why's there no garden?

722
00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:22.298
It's on the terrace.

723
00:55:22.424 --> 00:55:24.381
That's not a garden.

724
00:55:24.507 --> 00:55:27.173
It's not like Grandma's.

725
00:55:30.007 --> 00:55:33.089
Loic has a garden.

726
00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:37.464
But Loic's house is tiny.
This one's big.


727
00:55:37.632 --> 00:55:38.673
Why?

728
00:55:38.882 --> 00:55:40.464
That's how it is.

729
00:55:44.882 --> 00:55:47.839
There's a garden over there...

730
00:55:48.132 --> 00:55:52.714
You saw it when we got here.
Sharp girl. It's too cold now.


731
00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:55.673
I have my coat.

732
00:55:56.424 --> 00:55:58.881
I can't take you. 
I have to stay.

733
00:55:59.049 --> 00:56:00.048
Why?

734
00:56:00.215 --> 00:56:02.006
I've work to do.

735
00:56:06.507 --> 00:56:08.964
Oh, it's a slow morning...

736
00:56:10.174 --> 00:56:13.089
Put your coat on, we're going out.

737
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:16.923
Make up your mind.

738
00:56:24.924 --> 00:56:26.881
We're going out for a bit.

739
00:56:27.007 --> 00:56:29.798
Don't be long. 
We'll get busy later.

740
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:52.298
Fetch the ball.

741
00:56:59.424 --> 00:57:00.464
Go on!

742
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:07.423
We're going home now.

743
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:12.131
Come on, Elise.

744
00:57:12.632 --> 00:57:14.673
It's a church?

745
00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.131
It's a cathedral.

746
00:57:17.674 --> 00:57:18.881
Let's go.

747
00:57:21.882 --> 00:57:22.923
Now what?

748
00:57:23.049 --> 00:57:26.881
I want to see the Nativity.

749
00:57:28.715 --> 00:57:29.464
What's the matter?

750
00:57:29.632 --> 00:57:32.048
I want to see the church.

751
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.506
We haven't time now.

752
00:57:34.674 --> 00:57:35.839
We do!

753
00:57:37.257 --> 00:57:38.798
OK, just for a moment.

754
00:57:46.715 --> 00:57:48.048
See little Jesus.

755
00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:50.089
Recognize him?

756
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:52.673
Come along now.

757
00:57:53.757 --> 00:57:56.131
I want to stay!

758
00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:58.923
You can look, but don't touch.

759
00:58:56.715 --> 00:58:58.548
You have customers waiting!

760
00:58:58.757 --> 00:59:00.548
Sorry, Elise needed air.

761
00:59:00.715 --> 00:59:04.006
You said a couple of minutes,
that was 2 hours ago!


762
00:59:04.132 --> 00:59:07.631
You called me the boss.
I'll do my part.


763
00:59:07.799 --> 00:59:11.089
Go up to your room.

764
00:59:34.090 --> 00:59:36.506
This your coat?

765
00:59:46.299 --> 00:59:48.923
The child's hungry,
I'm going up for a while.


766
00:59:55.715 --> 00:59:57.006
Happy holidays.

767
00:59:57.174 --> 00:59:58.631
Thanks, you too.

768
01:00:04.424 --> 01:00:06.714
The little man was very nice,

769
01:00:06.882 --> 01:00:11.131
and the witch's family was wicked...

770
01:00:11.299 --> 01:00:12.381
Lunch.

771
01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:15.839
Why was it wicked?

772
01:00:16.965 --> 01:00:21.589
It was mad at the little boy.

773
01:00:22.715 --> 01:00:24.339
Felicie, you hear me?

774
01:00:24.507 --> 01:00:26.464
I'm in the kitchen.

775
01:00:26.674 --> 01:00:29.548
It was mad at him
and so it was mad


776
01:00:30.299 --> 01:00:33.381
at the bear and the little boy.

777
01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:37.256
Why was it mad?

778
01:00:37.424 --> 01:00:40.923
'Cause the little bear

779
01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:43.798
and the little boy,

780
01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.423
helped all people with problems.

781
01:00:50.965 --> 01:00:51.923
What's up?

782
01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:56.298
I've been thinking.
We need to get organized.


783
01:00:56.465 --> 01:01:00.214
You can't tend to Elise
and work during the holidays.


784
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:05.673
We should hire a temp,
or a nursemaid.


785
01:01:06.215 --> 01:01:07.548
How about it?

786
01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:10.673
You decide.

787
01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.339
It's beside the point.

788
01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:15.256
So what's the point?

789
01:01:16.465 --> 01:01:17.506
Eat!

790
01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:18.714
Come on.

791
01:01:30.174 --> 01:01:34.173
Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you
calling you the boss.


792
01:01:35.215 --> 01:01:37.339
It's a matter of organization.

793
01:01:37.507 --> 01:01:38.839
I'm going back home.

794
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.923
What?

795
01:01:40.132 --> 01:01:42.298
I've decided to return to Paris.

796
01:01:44.132 --> 01:01:45.506
Why?

797
01:01:47.132 --> 01:01:50.673
What have you suddenly got
against me?


798
01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.548
Nothing special. 
Nothing's changed.

799
01:01:56.465 --> 01:01:59.423
I love you as I did before,
no more, no less.


800
01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:00.714
Well, then?

801
01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:02.548
Not enough to live with you.

802
01:02:03.132 --> 01:02:05.798
How much is "enough"?

803
01:02:07.007 --> 01:02:11.381
Enough! I can only live with a man
I'm madly in love with.


804
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:13.589
I'm not crazy about you.

805
01:02:13.757 --> 01:02:15.214
This is insane!

806
01:02:15.382 --> 01:02:17.589
It's mad to be mad
about someone.


807
01:02:17.965 --> 01:02:21.089
But I'm mad.
You have to take me as I am.


808
01:02:21.465 --> 01:02:23.756
You can't devote your life
to a nut!


809
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:26.048
You're not crazy.

810
01:02:26.507 --> 01:02:27.756
My flash decision

811
01:02:27.965 --> 01:02:29.131
to come was mad.

812
01:02:29.299 --> 01:02:31.506
You decided in a flash to leave!

813
01:02:31.674 --> 01:02:33.256
That's different.

814
01:02:33.424 --> 01:02:35.048
I don't see why.

815
01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:41.214
It is...

816
01:02:43.132 --> 01:02:46.673
My first decision
was made just to decide,


817
01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.464
I wasn't seeing clearly.

818
01:02:48.632 --> 01:02:50.089
You see clearly now?

819
01:02:50.215 --> 01:02:53.714
Very.
I've never seen so clearly before.


820
01:02:53.882 --> 01:02:56.589
Suddenly things became very clear.

821
01:02:56.757 --> 01:02:58.131
What's clear?

822
01:02:58.549 --> 01:03:02.839
What I said: I can't live with a man
I'm not mad about!


823
01:03:03.382 --> 01:03:06.089
To you, that's just words,
but not to me.


824
01:03:06.257 --> 01:03:10.048
Seeing doesn't mean I understand.
But that's how it is!


825
01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.756
What is all this?

826
01:03:11.924 --> 01:03:13.506
I don't get it at all.

827
01:03:15.715 --> 01:03:19.464
You can't understand.
I'm the one who saw, not you.


828
01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:22.548
- Let me go!
- Listen!


829
01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:23.714
Let go, it hurts!

830
01:03:23.882 --> 01:03:25.089
Tough!

831
01:03:25.757 --> 01:03:29.506
I rarely lose my temper,
but when I do, watch out!


832
01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:33.006
It's lousy, with things going so well.

833
01:03:36.424 --> 01:03:38.839
You're tired.

834
01:03:40.090 --> 01:03:43.589
I'll hire a temp for a week,
longer if you like.


835
01:03:44.174 --> 01:03:49.339
Forget the salon.
You'll have time to fix this place up.


836
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:52.881
I'm going back to Paris!
Let go or I'll slug you!


837
01:03:58.465 --> 01:04:01.089
Sorry, but it's physical.

838
01:04:02.174 --> 01:04:05.339
I won't be held by force,
especially today.


839
01:04:06.174 --> 01:04:10.339
I'm leaving anyway,
so let's part friends.


840
01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:12.673
I can't love you in these conditions.

841
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.423
Conditions can change.

842
01:04:16.715 --> 01:04:19.506
I mean they're so final.

843
01:04:20.257 --> 01:04:21.923
Don't come near me!

844
01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:25.673
Grant me one thing.

845
01:04:26.174 --> 01:04:30.048
You can do as you please,
but wait a bit.


846
01:04:30.757 --> 01:04:33.214
Give me that token of trust.

847
01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:37.464
I won't talk to you of friendship,
much less love.


848
01:04:40.674 --> 01:04:44.506
No, it would be pointless.

849
01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:48.006
I'm ashamed to do this to you.

850
01:04:48.174 --> 01:04:51.964
It puts you in an awkward spot.
Questions will be asked.


851
01:04:52.132 --> 01:04:52.756
Well?

852
01:04:52.965 --> 01:04:55.006
You covet respectability.

853
01:04:55.174 --> 01:04:56.173
So don't leave.

854
01:04:56.299 --> 01:04:59.964
The faster I go,
the fewer questions there'll be.


855
01:05:02.174 --> 01:05:04.881
Don't worry about me.
I'll tell the truth.


856
01:05:05.132 --> 01:05:09.923
That you're depressed,
but you'll be better soon.


857
01:05:12.424 --> 01:05:14.339
Anyway, you're tired.

858
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:17.006
What're you doing for lunch?

859
01:05:18.174 --> 01:05:19.964
Come on, I'll take you out.

860
01:05:20.965 --> 01:05:25.131
Not across the street, it's noisy.
We'll go to the fancy place.


861
01:05:25.674 --> 01:05:27.923
Don't touch me again, Max.

862
01:05:30.507 --> 01:05:33.464
Alright. I'm going out.

863
01:05:40.299 --> 01:05:42.256
I need some air, too.

864
01:05:44.465 --> 01:05:46.589
You can't say I get in your way.

865
01:05:48.299 --> 01:05:49.839
See you at the restaurant.

866
01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:09.839
Finished?

867
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.214
No chicken?

868
01:06:12.382 --> 01:06:13.506
I'm full.

869
01:06:13.674 --> 01:06:18.714
OK, eat your cheese and we're off.
We're going to Grandma's.


870
01:06:19.424 --> 01:06:20.631
We're not staying?

871
01:06:20.757 --> 01:06:22.381
No, we'll take the train.

872
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:23.214
Why?

873
01:06:23.424 --> 01:06:26.631
Like that. Basically,
you're pleased, no?


874
01:06:26.757 --> 01:06:28.589
What's basically mean?

875
01:06:28.757 --> 01:06:32.173
Down deep. I know you understand.

876
01:06:47.215 --> 01:06:48.589
What's going on?

877
01:06:48.757 --> 01:06:49.881
Hi, Mom.

878
01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.881
Nothing wrong. 
I changed my mind.

879
01:06:58.132 --> 01:06:59.464
Did you quarrel?

880
01:06:59.632 --> 01:07:04.506
No. He was sweet,
didn't try to stop me.


881
01:07:05.132 --> 01:07:08.464
I felt guilty:
he introduced me as his wife.


882
01:07:09.174 --> 01:07:13.673
It dented his respectability,
but he doesn't care a damn.


883
01:07:13.799 --> 01:07:15.464
How do you know?

884
01:07:15.715 --> 01:07:17.214
He said so.

885
01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:22.714
- Put your coat away.
- The lights aren't blinking.


886
01:07:22.882 --> 01:07:25.006
Go on. Come back later.

887
01:07:26.757 --> 01:07:29.589
He doesn't care a damn for you,
either?


888
01:07:29.882 --> 01:07:32.923
No, he understands.

889
01:07:33.257 --> 01:07:35.173
Understands what?

890
01:07:35.924 --> 01:07:38.631
Don't live with a woman
who doesn't love you.


891
01:07:39.257 --> 01:07:41.256
You told me you loved him.

892
01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:43.714
Not enough to live with him.

893
01:07:45.174 --> 01:07:49.089
OK, why should I defend him?

894
01:07:49.757 --> 01:07:52.298
I always thought you chose wrong.

895
01:07:52.924 --> 01:07:55.589
There are no good or bad choices.

896
01:07:55.757 --> 01:07:58.589
Choice shouldn't come into it.

897
01:07:59.007 --> 01:08:01.714
You'll have to choose someday.

898
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.964
OK, I chose. That's past now,
let's forget it.


899
01:08:06.507 --> 01:08:08.506
I want my mind clear.

900
01:08:08.965 --> 01:08:12.048
I'll find a 2-room apartment
for Elise and me.


901
01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:16.464
Ajob's no problem:
the Saint-Clair salon wanted me.


902
01:08:16.799 --> 01:08:18.923
At least I hope they still do.

903
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.089
And Loic?

904
01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:24.506
Oh, Loic.....

905
01:08:25.715 --> 01:08:29.714
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 28

906
01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.881
That's not bad.

907
01:09:26.007 --> 01:09:27.339
Felicie!

908
01:09:29.924 --> 01:09:31.256
Haven't you left yet?

909
01:09:31.382 --> 01:09:33.673
- Yes, now I'm back.
- Back?


910
01:09:35.007 --> 01:09:37.089
Am I in the way?

911
01:09:39.007 --> 01:09:40.464
Come into my office.

912
01:09:53.257 --> 01:09:54.256
And Maxence?

913
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:55.839
He stayed. I left him.

914
01:09:56.007 --> 01:09:56.964
That so?

915
01:09:58.757 --> 01:10:00.006
Sit down.

916
01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.131
It's weird, we didn't even quarrel.

917
01:10:05.424 --> 01:10:09.381
He said something that hurt me.
It was the last straw.


918
01:10:10.007 --> 01:10:12.006
What happened before that?

919
01:10:12.924 --> 01:10:15.548
Nothing...a feeling.

920
01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:17.173
It was coming apart.

921
01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.381
What was?

922
01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:23.339
Everything. The first time
I went to Nevers, it all worked:


923
01:10:23.507 --> 01:10:26.131
the town, the house, the people.

924
01:10:26.465 --> 01:10:28.673
The second time it was lousy.

925
01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.589
First I saw the pluses,
then the minuses.


926
01:10:38.299 --> 01:10:41.631
...Yes, absolutely...

927
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:46.089
Thanks for calling.

928
01:10:49.757 --> 01:10:52.131
He didn't just let you go!

929
01:10:52.299 --> 01:10:56.964
He did.
I thought we'd argue for hours.


930
01:10:57.132 --> 01:11:00.214
I saw it coming: take your time,
think it over,


931
01:11:00.382 --> 01:11:01.464
there's no rush.

932
01:11:02.382 --> 01:11:05.839
He said it all,
then turned and went out to eat.


933
01:11:06.007 --> 01:11:06.756
I see.

934
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:10.381
You didn't hold me back, either.

935
01:11:10.549 --> 01:11:15.673
I couldn't hold you by force.
And arguing with you is useless.


936
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.173
You usually argue.
With me you argued less...


937
01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:20.381
...than usual.

938
01:11:20.549 --> 01:11:25.173
I thought that
because things were really serious,


939
01:11:25.632 --> 01:11:28.964
I could only hold you
by letting you go.


940
01:11:29.757 --> 01:11:30.714
It didn't work.

941
01:11:30.882 --> 01:11:32.048
You came back.

942
01:11:32.174 --> 01:11:33.714
But not to you.

943
01:11:35.215 --> 01:11:36.964
Well, maybe a little.

944
01:11:37.174 --> 01:11:38.839
What do you want men to do?

945
01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:43.256
Use force? Grovel at your feet?
Threaten suicide?


946
01:11:44.715 --> 01:11:46.173
You know I don't.

947
01:11:47.299 --> 01:11:50.423
I'm delighted
you were both so sweet to me,


948
01:11:50.632 --> 01:11:52.756
but I still think it's weird.

949
01:11:52.924 --> 01:11:54.173
Why weird?

950
01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:58.631
Because it is. You start out yelling,
then suddenly stop.


951
01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:04.506
That's normal. 
We control ourselves.

952
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:07.089
With me it was too easy.

953
01:12:07.257 --> 01:12:11.714
When people don't resist, I feel...

954
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:13.506
Confused?

955
01:12:13.674 --> 01:12:17.464
That's right. I drift.
It's an odd feeling.


956
01:12:17.632 --> 01:12:20.756
It figures,
if you keep changing your mind.


957
01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.839
What will you do now?

958
01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.006
You lost yourjob.

959
01:12:27.715 --> 01:12:32.048
I found another...
I'll get the answer today.


960
01:12:32.632 --> 01:12:34.923
The pay's better than at Maxence's.

961
01:12:36.424 --> 01:12:38.631
I can rent a small place
for me and Elise.


962
01:12:38.799 --> 01:12:41.089
- Were?
- I'll find one.


963
01:12:41.257 --> 01:12:45.423
Move in with me.
We can fix up the room upstairs.


964
01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.548
I didn't leave Maxence
to go back to you!


965
01:12:48.715 --> 01:12:52.839
I'm just suggesting
a friendly arrangement.


966
01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.256
That's sweet. But you don't mean it.

967
01:12:56.424 --> 01:13:00.589
I do mean it,
but I thought you'd say no.


968
01:13:01.465 --> 01:13:02.964
Then why'd you ask me?

969
01:13:03.132 --> 01:13:05.673
Maybe I could persuade you.

970
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:09.964
I'm not starting again.

971
01:13:10.132 --> 01:13:14.131
If I ever live in a man's home,
it won't be yours.


972
01:13:17.299 --> 01:13:19.756
Don't look so sad. You know why?

973
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:24.673
I love you. Not enough to live
with you, only to ruin your life.


974
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.964
You're not!

975
01:13:26.132 --> 01:13:27.923
Don't start again!

976
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:33.631
At least my leaving clarified things.
Now we can be real friends.


977
01:13:34.549 --> 01:13:35.839
You don't want to?

978
01:13:37.174 --> 01:13:38.298
OK.

979
01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:40.923
OK for real?

980
01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:42.756
OK for real.

981
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:52.298
I feel like being with you. Got plans?

982
01:13:52.465 --> 01:13:54.548
I'm going to the theatre.

983
01:13:54.757 --> 01:13:55.798
Alone?

984
01:13:55.924 --> 01:14:00.673
Yes. If we get there early,
we can get you a ticket.


985
01:14:01.049 --> 01:14:03.006
I don't know if you'll like it.

986
01:14:03.424 --> 01:14:05.506
- What's on?
- Shakespeare.


987
01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.173
I know "Romeo and Juliet"?

988
01:14:07.299 --> 01:14:09.714
No, "The Winter's Tale".

989
01:14:09.882 --> 01:14:12.048
What's it about?

990
01:14:12.757 --> 01:14:16.756
I've read the play.
It's pretty far-fetched.


991
01:14:16.965 --> 01:14:17.881
Complicated?

992
01:14:18.049 --> 01:14:21.506
No. But lots of...

993
01:14:27.174 --> 01:14:30.089
Lots of fantastic things happen.

994
01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:33.881
People who were thought dead,
exiles


995
01:14:34.049 --> 01:14:36.423
who reappear resurrected.

996
01:14:37.299 --> 01:14:39.173
I can't tell you the plot.

997
01:14:39.382 --> 01:14:41.923
OK. If it's like "Romeo",
I'll like it.


998
01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.673
See you later.

999
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:45.506
See you tonight.

1000
01:14:50.965 --> 01:14:55.214
"O Paulina,
we honour you with trouble.

I react like a little girl.

When the statue moved
I almost screamed.


1108

I almost screamed,
you squeezed my hand so hard.


1109

I didn't realize.

1110

The play's not plausible.

1111
01:22:39.757 --> 01:22:41.923
I don't like what's plausible.

1112

One ambiguity bothers me.

1113
01:22:47.132 --> 01:22:51.256
Does magic bring the statue
to life, or hadn't she ever died?


1114
01:22:51.757 --> 01:22:56.673
You don't get it.
Faith brings her to life.


1115
01:22:57.049 --> 01:22:59.548
I'm more religious than you.

1116
01:22:59.715 --> 01:23:01.339
From some viewpoints.

1117
01:23:02.007 --> 01:23:05.839
Even from yours. I'll tell you
something that'll startle you.


1118
01:23:06.132 --> 01:23:08.423
Yesterday I prayed in church.

1119
01:23:08.549 --> 01:23:10.714
- Where?
- In Nevers.


1120
01:23:11.549 --> 01:23:16.089
I had sort of a row with Maxence.
Something he said hurt me.


1121
01:23:17.299 --> 01:23:19.964
I went out to
get it off my mind.

1122
01:23:20.257 --> 01:23:23.506
We passed the cathedral,
Elise wanted to see the Nativity.


1123
01:23:23.674 --> 01:23:27.173
Mum tells her about God,
and sets up a Nativity at home.


1124
01:23:28.049 --> 01:23:29.714
So we went in.

1125
01:23:31.174 --> 01:23:33.881
While she looked, 
I sat on a chair.

1126
01:23:34.049 --> 01:23:35.048
And prayed?

1127
01:23:35.215 --> 01:23:38.756
Yes...but not like
I was taught as a kid.


1128
01:23:39.757 --> 01:23:42.756
In my own way.

1129
01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:47.048
It's more reflection than prayer.

1130
01:23:47.174 --> 01:23:48.298
Meditation.

1131
01:23:48.465 --> 01:23:49.798
That's it.

1132
01:23:51.549 --> 01:23:54.339
When you have something
on your mind,


1133
01:23:54.882 --> 01:23:58.548
when you've slept badly
and face a decision,


1134
01:23:58.715 --> 01:24:02.298
a kind of excitement in the brain
makes you think faster.


1135
01:24:02.465 --> 01:24:05.923
That's what I felt,
but a hundred times stronger.


1136
01:24:06.090 --> 01:24:09.714
Suddenly, everything was clear,
it was...


1137
01:24:10.049 --> 01:24:11.048
Dazzling?

1138
01:24:11.215 --> 01:24:14.631
I wasn't dazzled,
I saw everything clearly.


1139
01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.798
What did you see?

1140
01:24:18.507 --> 01:24:20.298
It's hard to say.

1141
01:24:20.965 --> 01:24:24.881
I didn't think, 
I saw my thoughts.

1142
01:24:25.882 --> 01:24:31.048
All my reasoning on whether
to leave or not came in a flash.


1143
01:24:32.507 --> 01:24:33.923
And I saw it,

1144
01:24:34.299 --> 01:24:38.089
I saw what I had to do,
and saw I was right.


1145
01:24:38.299 --> 01:24:40.089
You mean return to Paris?

1146
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:45.339
Before, I'd tried to choose,
then I saw there was no choice.


1147
01:24:45.465 --> 01:24:49.506
I didn't have to choose
something I didn't want.


1148
01:24:50.965 --> 01:24:53.131
See? I know it sounds trite,

1149
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:56.756
but suddenly it seemed obvious.

1150
01:24:57.465 --> 01:24:59.548
It's hard to explain.

1151
01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.464
I understand.

1152
01:25:03.549 --> 01:25:08.798
I've had lucid moments,
although not that clear.


1153
01:25:10.007 --> 01:25:12.464
People who convert

1154
01:25:12.715 --> 01:25:17.589
sometimes have these illuminations
in church, like you.


1155
01:25:17.715 --> 01:25:19.839
But I didn't convert.

1156
01:25:20.132 --> 01:25:21.756
You believed already.

1157
01:25:25.465 --> 01:25:30.048
If I were God,
I'd cherish you particularly.


1158
01:25:30.174 --> 01:25:31.381
Why?

1159
01:25:31.549 --> 01:25:35.381
Because you were
unjustly unhappy,


1160
01:25:35.507 --> 01:25:39.298
and you can sacrifice
your happiness, your life


1161
01:25:39.465 --> 01:25:41.756
to a love that's out of reach.

1162
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:45.964
Then God should
give me back Charles.


1163
01:25:46.132 --> 01:25:47.214
Whoa!

1164
01:25:47.549 --> 01:25:49.714
That may not be
the right request.


1165
01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:52.589
I'm not asking him for anything.

1166
01:25:52.924 --> 01:25:56.589
I didn't think of God,
though I do sometimes.


1167
01:26:00.132 --> 01:26:04.714
In that second that was
so full of things, I saw


1168
01:26:05.632 --> 01:26:10.214
I was alone in the world:
it was up to me to act,


1169
01:26:10.382 --> 01:26:14.298
and not be pushed around
by anyone or anything.


1170
01:26:14.465 --> 01:26:17.048
That won't help you find Charles.

1171
01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:20.506
I won't do things
that keep me from finding him.


1172
01:26:21.715 --> 01:26:22.714
Besides...

1173
01:26:24.757 --> 01:26:27.631
I thought of something else
in that second...


1174
01:26:27.799 --> 01:26:30.923
Maybe you're right:
finding him's unlikely,


1175
01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:33.589
he may be married,
or doesn't love me.


1176
01:26:33.715 --> 01:26:36.173
But that's no reason
for me to give up.


1177
01:26:37.215 --> 01:26:41.256
If even you admit
your chances are nearly nil,


1178
01:26:41.549 --> 01:26:43.256
why ruin your life for...?

1179
01:26:43.424 --> 01:26:47.548
Because if I find him, it'll be so....

1180
01:26:48.632 --> 01:26:52.381
a joy so great
I'll gladly give my life for it.


1181
01:26:52.965 --> 01:26:57.839
And I'm not ruining it:
not everyone lives with hope.


1182
01:26:58.382 --> 01:26:59.589
You mean that?

1183
01:26:59.924 --> 01:27:02.881
I believe it,
even if it sounds stupid.


1184
01:27:03.465 --> 01:27:08.214
It's not stupid. Someone
very bright said it earlier.


1185
01:27:08.674 --> 01:27:12.089
Almost word for word.
I doubt if you've read it.


1186
01:27:12.757 --> 01:27:14.339
Shakespeare?

1187
01:27:14.507 --> 01:27:16.923
No, Pascal.

1188
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:18.714
A philosopher?

1189
01:27:18.924 --> 01:27:20.548
In a way.

1190
01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.756
He calls it a bet:

1191
01:27:23.882 --> 01:27:26.631
if you bet on immortality,

1192
01:27:26.757 --> 01:27:30.548
the stake is so huge
it makes up for the long odds.


1193
01:27:30.715 --> 01:27:34.548
Even if the soul isn't immortal,
believing it is


1194
01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.923
lets you live better.

1195
01:27:37.132 --> 01:27:41.756
I believe the soul's immortal,
more than you do.


1196
01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:45.339
You believe in it only after death,
I say it exists


1197
01:27:45.549 --> 01:27:46.881
before birth.

1198
01:27:47.382 --> 01:27:49.673
Maybe Edwige sold you on it,
but not me.


1199
01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.589
I don't need her to believe in it.
To me it's obvious.


1200
01:27:53.757 --> 01:27:57.923
If the soul lives on afterward,
why didn't it live before?


1201
01:27:58.049 --> 01:28:00.756
What's a soul with no identity?

1202
01:28:00.924 --> 01:28:03.381
Who are you
if your previous life's a blank?


1203
01:28:03.674 --> 01:28:06.964
I'm aware of mine. It exists.

1204
01:28:07.257 --> 01:28:09.464
It's dim, but it exists.

1205
01:28:09.674 --> 01:28:12.339
You are, too,
but you don't realize it.


1206
01:28:14.632 --> 01:28:17.256
Why am I certain I love Charles?

1207
01:28:17.424 --> 01:28:19.798
How can I be absolutely sure?

1208
01:28:20.465 --> 01:28:25.631
When I met him,
I felt I'd been through it before.


1209
01:28:25.965 --> 01:28:30.048
How do you explain it
unless we'd met in a former life?


1210
01:28:30.549 --> 01:28:32.714
Stop, you're killing me.

1211
01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.673
It's not crap!

1212
01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.173
It's instinctive science!

1213
01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.964
But it's not Pascal this time.

1214
01:28:40.882 --> 01:28:42.464
Victor Hugo?

1215
01:28:42.799 --> 01:28:44.339
Plato.

1216
01:28:44.507 --> 01:28:46.464
He's all we needed.

1217
01:28:46.882 --> 01:28:49.548
He believed in reincarnation, too.

1218
01:28:49.715 --> 01:28:53.798
Yes and no. But that's another story.

1219
01:28:54.257 --> 01:28:57.964
The point is he reasoned
just like you


1220
01:28:58.132 --> 01:29:00.756
to prove the soul's immortal.

1221
01:29:01.715 --> 01:29:05.214
It's called reasoning
by "recollection".


1222
01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:07.131
You don't agree?

1223
01:29:07.299 --> 01:29:09.923
I don't share the Greeks' religion.

1224
01:29:10.299 --> 01:29:13.006
Plato may not have, either.

1225
01:29:14.632 --> 01:29:16.381
"Cebes added:

1226
01:29:16.549 --> 01:29:19.673
"Your doctrine, that knowledge
is simply recollection,


1227
01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.006
"if true, also implies
a previous time


1228
01:29:23.215 --> 01:29:25.631
"in which we have learned

1229
01:29:25.799 --> 01:29:28.923
"that which we now recollect.

1230
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:32.089
"This would be impossible
unless our soul..."


1231
01:29:32.257 --> 01:29:34.256
- Careful, it's hot.
- Thanks.


1232
01:29:34.507 --> 01:29:35.131
"...had been

1233
01:29:35.299 --> 01:29:38.548
"in some place before existing
in the form of man."


1234
01:29:40.757 --> 01:29:44.881
That quote was on my college
finals. I haven't forgotten it.


1235
01:29:49.007 --> 01:29:52.339
But I see
Plato's reincarnation doctrine


1236
01:29:53.049 --> 01:29:55.589
as what's called a myth.

1237
01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:57.673
Yeah, mythology.

1238
01:29:57.924 --> 01:29:59.214
No...

1239
01:30:02.007 --> 01:30:06.423
It means he didn't really believe it
as objective truth.


1240
01:30:06.757 --> 01:30:11.673
It was a convenient notion
for his time, which doesn't prove


1241
01:30:11.882 --> 01:30:15.381
the soul is immortal
as a substance,


1242
01:30:15.549 --> 01:30:19.631
but affirms the presence
in our "learning"


1243
01:30:19.757 --> 01:30:22.464
of something anterior
to experience.


1244
01:30:23.549 --> 01:30:25.423
That's why it's so modern.

1245
01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:30.048
I'm boring you.

1246
01:30:31.132 --> 01:30:33.423
No, you amuse me.

1247
01:30:36.757 --> 01:30:40.506
You've taught me a lot.
I feel much less ignorant.


1248
01:30:41.382 --> 01:30:43.214
You gave me a yen to read.

1249
01:30:44.632 --> 01:30:46.756
But I don't have your mentality.

1250
01:30:47.049 --> 01:30:48.506
What mentality?

1251
01:30:48.715 --> 01:30:51.423
You can't do without books.

1252
01:30:51.632 --> 01:30:55.464
If I say I love you, you'll check
to see if that's in a book.


1253
01:30:56.007 --> 01:31:00.923
To you, only what's written is true.
It's a gulf between us.


1254
01:31:01.757 --> 01:31:03.589
It doesn't bother me.

1255
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:08.089
It does me.

1256
01:31:09.007 --> 01:31:12.881
You said you're glad
you learned so much from me.


1257
01:31:13.424 --> 01:31:17.131
Yes, but I'll never
be an egghead.


1258
01:31:18.090 --> 01:31:22.381
I don't want to be one.
I want to be me.


1259
01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:27.881
In the cathedral yesterday,
I felt entirely myself.


1260
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:32.173
5 years ago, I felt like me, too.

1261
01:31:36.007 --> 01:31:37.256
With you,

1262
01:31:38.757 --> 01:31:42.006
I feel good, but different.

1263
01:31:43.924 --> 01:31:46.881
Maybe we knew each other
in a former life, too.


1264
01:31:47.049 --> 01:31:50.839
Yes. You'd have been

1265
01:31:51.965 --> 01:31:55.964
my brother, maybe, not my lover.

1266
01:31:58.465 --> 01:32:00.756
There must've been some affection.

1267
01:32:01.674 --> 01:32:06.298
Maybe I was your dog or cat,
or you were mine.


1268
01:32:11.215 --> 01:32:13.006
I don't want to go home.

1269
01:32:15.632 --> 01:32:20.589
I'd like to sleep with you,
but I'll go right to sleep.


1270
01:32:22.007 --> 01:32:24.548
Alright.

1271
01:32:26.965 --> 01:32:30.006
SATURDAY, DECEMBER 29

1272
01:32:35.215 --> 01:32:37.756
Wait, Elise, don't run!

1273
01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:45.381
Wait for me, we'll get the tickets.

1274
01:32:57.132 --> 01:32:58.839
Look at its little tail.

1275
01:33:04.382 --> 01:33:07.881
Look at the lion in the cage...

1276
01:33:20.757 --> 01:33:23.673
"Nice work.

1277
01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:24.964
"I told you so.

1278
01:33:25.132 --> 01:33:27.589
"Now I've seen it for myself."

1279
01:33:57.299 --> 01:33:58.673
Wait for us!

1280
01:34:04.799 --> 01:34:07.631
Why. I can't go through.

1281
01:34:07.799 --> 01:34:10.006
Help her through.

1282
01:34:29.174 --> 01:34:32.339
We'll take the Metro.
You can go straight home.


1283
01:34:32.507 --> 01:34:37.756
Come to my house.
You can phone your mother.


1284
01:34:42.674 --> 01:34:44.048
We're going to Loic's.

1285
01:34:45.382 --> 01:34:47.714
SUNDAY, DECEMBER 30.

1286
01:34:48.424 --> 01:34:51.631
Look at my beautiful castle.

1287
01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:52.881
It is beautiful.

1288
01:34:53.049 --> 01:34:55.964
They destroyed everything.

1289
01:34:58.965 --> 01:35:02.589
I'd like to live
in a castle like that.


1290
01:35:02.757 --> 01:35:06.423
Maybe you can someday.

1291
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:09.631
No, never.

1292
01:35:09.799 --> 01:35:10.673
Why not?

1293
01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.214
I don't know.

1294
01:35:12.632 --> 01:35:17.214
It's OK, a bit cramped,
but...she slept better than I did.


1295
01:35:18.007 --> 01:35:21.506
I think we're staying here today.

1296
01:35:21.965 --> 01:35:25.339
She was tired, and so am I.

1297
01:35:26.382 --> 01:35:30.131
We'll go for a drive with Loic.

1298
01:35:31.715 --> 01:35:34.173
Take care, Mum. 
I'll put her on.

1299
01:35:35.215 --> 01:35:37.339
Elise, come here.

1300
01:35:45.299 --> 01:35:48.214
How are you, grandma?

1301
01:35:48.507 --> 01:35:50.506
I'm fine.

1302
01:35:53.799 --> 01:35:57.673
I slept with Mummy in a big bed.

1303
01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:14.673
I knew there was a Sunday market.

1304
01:36:15.674 --> 01:36:17.798
It's great. Come here often?

1305
01:36:17.965 --> 01:36:19.506
Not in 10 years.

1306
01:36:20.924 --> 01:36:23.714
Hasn't changed much.

1307
01:36:25.882 --> 01:36:27.048
Behind those trees

1308
01:36:28.174 --> 01:36:29.964
is a pretty little church.

1309
01:36:32.674 --> 01:36:33.964
The church!

1310
01:36:34.382 --> 01:36:36.423
Yes, behind the trees.

1311
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:40.464
Today's Sunday. The church.

1312
01:36:40.632 --> 01:36:44.006
You mean I ought to go to mass.

1313
01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:48.756
No, I'm with you.
Unless you want to go, too.


1314
01:36:48.924 --> 01:36:50.214
Certainly not.

1315
01:36:50.382 --> 01:36:52.464
You went the other day.

1316
01:36:54.090 --> 01:36:57.464
On a weekday. You're Catholic.
You should go to mass.


1317
01:36:58.424 --> 01:37:02.089
Maybe. If I was alone.
But I won't bother you with that.


1318
01:37:02.382 --> 01:37:06.423
It's no bother. Don't sacrifice
your convictions for me.


1319
01:37:07.965 --> 01:37:09.339
You come too.

1320
01:37:09.632 --> 01:37:13.548
I won't sacrifice
my convictions for you, either.


1321
01:37:14.049 --> 01:37:15.881
My convictions...

1322
01:37:17.299 --> 01:37:19.506
You know how to pray. Pray for me.

1323
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:22.381
What'll you do, meanwhile?

1324
01:37:23.257 --> 01:37:26.548
The shopping.
And we'll go to the park.


1325
01:37:28.090 --> 01:37:29.589
I'll go some other day.

1326
01:37:29.757 --> 01:37:33.506
No! Today! And you'll pray for me.

1327
01:37:34.174 --> 01:37:35.631
I always pray for you.

1328
01:37:35.799 --> 01:37:40.464
This time really do it for me.
I mean, as if you were me.


1329
01:37:41.299 --> 01:37:42.964
What'll I ask for?

1330
01:37:43.507 --> 01:37:46.506
What I'd ask for.
Even if you don't agree.


1331
01:37:46.924 --> 01:37:49.256
I'm very demanding.

1332
01:37:49.424 --> 01:37:54.881
I do pray for your happiness,
even if it's not mine.


1333
01:37:55.299 --> 01:38:00.589
Do it from the bottom of your heart.

1334
01:38:02.049 --> 01:38:04.256
I'll try.

1335
01:38:04.424 --> 01:38:07.464
What do you mean, you'll try?

1336
01:38:08.632 --> 01:38:11.006
You do ask a lot of me.

1337
01:38:11.465 --> 01:38:12.756
See you later.

1338
01:38:13.174 --> 01:38:15.048
We going shopping?

1339
01:38:20.965 --> 01:38:25.589
I don't have to go away tomorrow.
I saw the family at Christmas.


1340
01:38:25.757 --> 01:38:29.131
For us, Christmas is what counts,
not New Year's.


1341
01:38:29.549 --> 01:38:31.631
If you stay, what'll you do?

1342
01:38:31.799 --> 01:38:33.214
Whatever you say.

1343
01:38:35.132 --> 01:38:37.881
Feel like spending a day
at the shore?


1344
01:38:38.799 --> 01:38:42.131
I'm tied up.
We're having a party at home.


1345
01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:46.756
At Christmas I wasn't there,
one sister was away...


1346
01:38:47.382 --> 01:38:49.131
Now they're all coming.

1347
01:38:49.299 --> 01:38:51.298
What if you'd stayed in Nevers?

1348
01:38:51.924 --> 01:38:54.089
I'd have come up with Maxence.

1349
01:38:55.965 --> 01:38:57.381
You can come, you know.

1350
01:38:57.549 --> 01:38:59.089
As your fiancĂ©?

1351
01:39:00.090 --> 01:39:05.089
Of course they'd think that.
It'd delight them at home.


1352
01:39:07.632 --> 01:39:09.756
I can't see myself
at your folks' place.


1353
01:39:09.924 --> 01:39:11.423
Why not? Come.

1354
01:39:12.049 --> 01:39:12.756
You kidding!

1355
01:39:12.924 --> 01:39:17.464
I'm not. My brother and sister
are coming, with their families.


1356
01:39:17.632 --> 01:39:19.506
I look silly there by myself.

1357
01:39:19.674 --> 01:39:22.089
I'm not your wife!

1358
01:39:22.257 --> 01:39:25.006
What would your parents say?
They're so Catholic...


1359
01:39:25.174 --> 01:39:26.964
Yes, but broad-minded.

1360
01:39:28.132 --> 01:39:31.964
If I introduced you,
they'd think I want to marry you.


1361
01:39:33.132 --> 01:39:36.548
They want their son marrying
an unwed mother?


1362
01:39:36.799 --> 01:39:38.756
These days...

1363
01:39:39.924 --> 01:39:42.464
I'm neither widowed nor divorced.

1364
01:39:42.924 --> 01:39:45.506
Charles might appear at any moment.

1365
01:39:45.882 --> 01:39:50.006
At any moment! 
No one believes that!

1366
01:39:51.715 --> 01:39:54.214
You said you didn't either anymore.

1367
01:39:54.799 --> 01:39:58.589
Any sensible woman is more likely
be seduced by a stranger,


1368
01:39:58.757 --> 01:40:01.673
than you are
of meeting Elise's father,


1369
01:40:02.132 --> 01:40:04.964
even assuming he still loves you.

1370
01:40:05.132 --> 01:40:07.089
That's how everyone figures it.

1371
01:40:07.257 --> 01:40:10.881
They're wrong!
They only see things from outside.


1372
01:40:12.132 --> 01:40:14.506
Charles reappearing
is not what matters.


1373
01:40:14.674 --> 01:40:18.381
He remains in my heart,
so I can't give it to anyone else.


1374
01:40:19.799 --> 01:40:22.173
You say you're inarticulate,

1375
01:40:22.757 --> 01:40:25.798
but sometimes
you say things beautifully.


1376
01:40:26.590 --> 01:40:29.381
Because my feelings are speaking.

1377
01:40:30.049 --> 01:40:31.631
We'll go up.

1378
01:40:32.007 --> 01:40:33.131
Goodnight.

1379
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.298
Give Loic a kiss.

1380
01:40:41.757 --> 01:40:44.214
- Coming back down?
- Why?


1381
01:40:44.507 --> 01:40:48.298
It's early.
You won't sleep right away.


1382
01:40:48.465 --> 01:40:50.006
There are lots of books.

1383
01:40:50.174 --> 01:40:51.714
You can read here.

1384
01:40:52.299 --> 01:40:54.464
I'll wake Elise when I go back up.

1385
01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:56.339
There's a bed here.

1386
01:40:56.507 --> 01:40:58.048
But you're in it.

1387
01:40:58.424 --> 01:40:59.798
I was on Friday, too.

1388
01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:06.048
That was different, I needed
consolation. The day was special.


1389
01:41:06.215 --> 01:41:08.048
And on ordinary days?

1390
01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:11.714
We didn't sleep
like brother and sister.


1391
01:41:12.049 --> 01:41:14.923
Why not continue?

1392
01:41:15.465 --> 01:41:17.589
You ask God for that this morning?

1393
01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.714
It's up to you, not to God.
He can't object to your being my wife.


1394
01:41:22.882 --> 01:41:26.214
If I don't want to,
God doesn't either.


1395
01:41:27.424 --> 01:41:28.548
Now goodnight.

1396
01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:37.214
I'm feeling weak,
don't take advantage of it.


1397
01:41:38.882 --> 01:41:40.131
Come on.

1398
01:41:41.257 --> 01:41:43.714
Sometimes I'd rather be you.

1399
01:41:43.882 --> 01:41:45.048
Don't say that.

1400
01:41:45.215 --> 01:41:46.339
I mean it.

1401
01:41:50.632 --> 01:41:53.548
MONDAY, DECEMBER 31 .

1402
01:41:57.174 --> 01:41:58.339
Don't want me to come?

1403
01:41:58.507 --> 01:42:01.756
No, I have to shop,
I've lots to do.


1404
01:42:01.924 --> 01:42:05.589
All right.
Have a nice New Year's Eve.


1405
01:42:05.924 --> 01:42:09.339
You too. Happy New Year.

1406
01:42:11.715 --> 01:42:12.756
So long, Elise.

1407
01:42:12.924 --> 01:42:15.048
No, I wanna kiss Mummy.

1408
01:42:15.215 --> 01:42:16.714
Kiss Loic.

1409
01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:19.839
OK, we're off.

1410
01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:22.214
A kiss, Mummy.

1411
01:42:28.965 --> 01:42:30.173
Say good-bye.

1412
01:42:36.507 --> 01:42:41.131
Maybe we can buy him a teapot.
Pretty, aren't they?


1413
01:43:21.799 --> 01:43:23.298
Let's see your mouth.

1414
01:43:24.757 --> 01:43:26.006
Close your mouth.

1415
01:43:42.965 --> 01:43:44.298
Sit straight.

1416
01:43:56.382 --> 01:43:57.714
Felicie!

1417
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:03.548
You're in France!

1418
01:44:04.257 --> 01:44:06.214
Haven't been here long.

1419
01:44:07.465 --> 01:44:08.964
That your daughter?

1420
01:44:09.174 --> 01:44:11.423
If you knew how dumb I am.

1421
01:44:13.132 --> 01:44:14.006
If you'd told me.

1422
01:44:14.174 --> 01:44:15.839
I'd have understood.

1423
01:44:16.007 --> 01:44:19.464
It's not what you think.
I told you the wrong town!


1424
01:44:19.632 --> 01:44:20.589
What?

1425
01:44:20.757 --> 01:44:24.173
The wrong town! I said Courbevoie
instead of Levallois.


1426
01:44:24.924 --> 01:44:29.506
Like that, stupidly. A slip.

1427
01:44:35.799 --> 01:44:37.964
Felicie, this is Dora.

1428
01:44:38.132 --> 01:44:42.506
Charles has spoken of you.
What a terrible thing to happen!


1429
01:44:42.674 --> 01:44:45.839
I was so dumb
I gave her no address at all.


1430
01:44:46.257 --> 01:44:47.381
Why not?

1431
01:44:48.007 --> 01:44:52.923
I was moving around.
I could have given her a mail drop.


1432
01:44:53.090 --> 01:44:55.464
You think others can't make errors.

1433
01:44:55.632 --> 01:44:58.798
This was a tremendous error.

1434
01:45:00.507 --> 01:45:01.631
If I'd left
an address,


1435
01:45:01.799 --> 01:45:05.256
I wouldn't have had this problem.
You're funny!


1436
01:45:20.424 --> 01:45:22.048
Give me your address.

1437
01:45:23.924 --> 01:45:26.256
I'll call you.

1438
01:45:30.299 --> 01:45:31.173
You're crazy!

1439
01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:33.423
You're crazy! Give me your address!

1440
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:34.506
But your wife...!

1441
01:45:34.674 --> 01:45:37.798
She's not my wife, she's a friend.

1442
01:45:40.299 --> 01:45:43.923
At least take my address,
so I can't intrude on your life.


1443
01:45:44.215 --> 01:45:46.506
Not scared I'll intrude on yours?

1444
01:45:47.257 --> 01:45:50.839
No, I've no woman in my life now.

1445
01:45:51.924 --> 01:45:53.506
No children, either.

1446
01:45:54.674 --> 01:45:57.131
No wife? No children?

1447
01:45:57.299 --> 01:46:00.214
Why would I lie to you?

1448
01:46:01.007 --> 01:46:02.339
I believe you've no wife.

1449
01:46:03.299 --> 01:46:04.673
About the child...

1450
01:46:10.424 --> 01:46:12.381
This is my daughter?

1451
01:46:15.965 --> 01:46:17.631
Doesn't she look like you?

1452
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:29.339
And you tried to run away!
You're crazy!


1453
01:46:30.257 --> 01:46:32.131
I thought you were taken.

1454
01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:36.339
Even if I was married,
or whatever...


1455
01:46:36.507 --> 01:46:38.464
I couldn't have stood it.

1456
01:46:41.299 --> 01:46:42.798
What's her name?

1457
01:46:44.465 --> 01:46:45.756
Ask her.

1458
01:46:45.924 --> 01:46:48.006
- What's your name?
- Elise.


1459
01:46:50.382 --> 01:46:51.464
Elise!

1460
01:46:52.049 --> 01:46:54.173
Ask her what your name is.

1461
01:46:55.799 --> 01:46:56.589
And my name?

1462
01:46:56.757 --> 01:46:57.756
Daddy.

1463
01:47:00.424 --> 01:47:02.256
This is impossible!

1464
01:47:02.424 --> 01:47:04.173
I showed her your photos.

1465
01:47:05.924 --> 01:47:07.673
I had none of you.

1466
01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:09.631
You recognized me anyway.

1467
01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:17.798
You live near here?

1468
01:47:18.090 --> 01:47:21.089
No. I have to take a bus
to my mother's.


1469
01:47:21.674 --> 01:47:23.506
What are you doing now?

1470
01:47:24.424 --> 01:47:27.298
Nothing special.

1471
01:47:27.674 --> 01:47:31.423
I'll go with you if you like.
Unless...


1472
01:47:32.215 --> 01:47:34.839
Now that I've got you,
I won't let go.


1473
01:47:37.965 --> 01:47:40.048
Let's catch the bus.

1474
01:47:58.757 --> 01:47:59.964
Mum?

1475
01:48:00.799 --> 01:48:02.839
I've brought you a cook.

1476
01:48:05.424 --> 01:48:07.048
A cook?

1477
01:48:11.132 --> 01:48:13.173
Why, it's...

1478
01:48:16.299 --> 01:48:18.173
- It's Charles.
- It's Daddy.


1479
01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:20.339
We met on a bus.

1480
01:48:20.632 --> 01:48:22.256
On a bus?

1481
01:48:23.632 --> 01:48:26.631
Really? How amazing!

1482
01:48:29.132 --> 01:48:29.798
On a bus.

1483
01:48:29.965 --> 01:48:31.006
Elise know?

1484
01:48:31.174 --> 01:48:33.173
She recognized him at once.

1485
01:48:33.715 --> 01:48:37.214
Happy you found your Daddy?

1486
01:48:43.174 --> 01:48:45.423
My little Daddy...

1487
01:49:00.674 --> 01:49:02.714
I'm thinner than I was.

1488
01:49:03.632 --> 01:49:06.131
Not too much, you're still OK.

1489
01:49:11.174 --> 01:49:15.631
Even without photos, I didn't...

1490
01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:17.214
...forget you.

1491
01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:24.506
You've had other women
in all this time, right?


1492
01:49:26.424 --> 01:49:31.673
It neverjelled. There were 2,
and I left them with no regrets.


1493
01:49:33.382 --> 01:49:34.423
I knew Dora,

1494
01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:36.214
before I met you.

1495
01:49:38.674 --> 01:49:41.881
We date when I'm in Paris,
catch up on each other.


1496
01:49:42.049 --> 01:49:44.173
I won't have to tell her this bit.

1497
01:49:47.257 --> 01:49:48.964
You must have someone, no?

1498
01:49:49.132 --> 01:49:53.298
I left him for someone else

1499
01:49:54.507 --> 01:49:55.881
And the "someone else"?

1500
01:49:59.007 --> 01:50:01.964
I left him a week ago, for you.

1501
01:50:02.257 --> 01:50:03.423
For me?

1502
01:50:04.757 --> 01:50:06.798
You didn't know we'd meet.

1503
01:50:07.424 --> 01:50:11.131
I had a premonition.

1504
01:50:15.590 --> 01:50:17.839
- I'm settling in France.
- In Paris?


1505
01:50:18.007 --> 01:50:21.714
On the Brittany coast.

1506
01:50:22.632 --> 01:50:24.173
You coming with me?

1507
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:25.631
To do what?

1508
01:50:25.799 --> 01:50:26.923
Help me.

1509
01:50:27.090 --> 01:50:28.089
In the kitchen?

1510
01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:32.214
As cashier, manager, whatever.

1511
01:50:32.382 --> 01:50:35.173
So I'd be the boss.
I'd like that with you.


1512
01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:36.756
Then you'll come?

1513
01:50:37.924 --> 01:50:39.006
Wait!

1514
01:50:40.549 --> 01:50:44.548
Recently I said yes right away,
without a real commitment.


1515
01:50:45.215 --> 01:50:48.131
This time it's a lot more serious.

1516
01:50:50.174 --> 01:50:51.714
I agree.

1517
01:51:09.549 --> 01:51:10.923
What's wrong?

1518
01:51:12.465 --> 01:51:14.131
Felicie, are you crying?

1519
01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:19.131
I'm not...They're tears ofjoy.

1520
01:51:41.007 --> 01:51:42.548
Got a tissue?

1521
01:51:55.965 --> 01:51:58.464
What's the matter, sweetie?

1522
01:51:59.132 --> 01:52:02.589
Mummy will be back.
She's with Daddy.


1523
01:52:03.549 --> 01:52:06.048
Aren't you happy
to have your Daddy?


1524
01:52:07.549 --> 01:52:09.089
You mustn't cry!

1525
01:52:09.257 --> 01:52:11.631
They're tears ofjoy.

1526
01:52:20.757 --> 01:52:22.464
Never mind, Mum, I'll get it.

1527
01:52:22.632 --> 01:52:23.923
Coming!

1528
01:52:40.590 --> 01:52:44.714
Can I open it?

1529
01:52:44.882 --> 01:52:46.423
It's for you.

1530
01:52:50.257 --> 01:52:51.464
The sailor's back.

1531
01:52:51.632 --> 01:52:52.381
The sailor?

1532
01:52:52.549 --> 01:52:54.131
It's what we called you.

1533
01:52:54.299 --> 01:52:58.173
You? Amazing! You found our address?

1534
01:52:58.340 --> 01:52:59.589
My sister, my brother-in-law.

1535
01:53:02.882 --> 01:53:04.423
We met on a bus.

1536
01:53:04.590 --> 01:53:07.214
No kidding! That's astonishing!

1537
01:53:07.382 --> 01:53:10.089
The things that happen!

1538
01:53:10.257 --> 01:53:13.131
But Felicie has premonitions...

1539
01:53:13.965 --> 01:53:16.881
I felt you felt something
was in the air...
