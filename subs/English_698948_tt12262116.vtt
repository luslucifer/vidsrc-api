1
00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:28.849
Tackle him, Chai.

2
00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:30.934
You can do it, Chai.

3
00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:49.286
Come on, Chai. Let's go eat.

4
00:02:08.138 --> 00:02:09.807
Hey Prem.

5
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.518
Your mother bought a SpongeBob cake
for your birthday party.


6
00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:17.481
SpongeBob cake
for a little boy!


7
00:02:19.608 --> 00:02:20.860
Stop giving me a hard time.

8
00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:24.947
Guess where we're going?

9
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:30.828
Before your party,
let's go to the cave.


10
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.082
Yeah, the cave
for the birthday boy!


11
00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.795
I'll race you to the park.

12
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.423
Then I better go with you.

13
00:02:42.506 --> 00:02:44.300
We have to go quickly,
it'll be dark soon.


14
00:02:46.927 --> 00:02:50.139
Coach, my dad's
cooking for the party.


15
00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:52.057
I promised to help.

16
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:53.684
You're a good son.

17
00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:54.768
See you at the party.

18
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:58.439
Okay, bye. See you at 7pm.

19
00:04:09.468 --> 00:04:10.636
Go! Go!

20
00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:13.096
Hey, Arm!

21
00:04:16.392 --> 00:04:17.518
Go!

22
00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.272
Ahh!

23
00:05:45.898 --> 00:05:47.733
Go, walk slowly.

24
00:05:51.028 --> 00:05:52.446
This is always the best part.

25
00:06:23.477 --> 00:06:24.477
Keep going!

26
00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:50.420
I told Prem to come straight home
after practice.


27
00:06:55.342 --> 00:06:59.304
Well, if they stop over tell them
we're waiting to start the party.


28
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.772
Sorry I'm late.

29
00:07:08.856 --> 00:07:10.983
The shop got really busy.

30
00:07:11.984 --> 00:07:13.068
You're Chai's mom, right?

31
00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:17.531
That's right.

32
00:07:17.614 --> 00:07:21.368
I want to watch the games
but I'm always working.


33
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:24.787
Bye.

34
00:07:25.914 --> 00:07:27.274
Looks like
they did go to the cave.


35
00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:29.208
All of them?

36
00:07:30.294 --> 00:07:31.920
In this rain?

37
00:07:32.004 --> 00:07:33.672
It wasn't raining earlier.

38
00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:38.427
Excuse me.

39
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.013
Shouldn't we drive to the cave
and get them?


40
00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:43.348
They'll get soaked riding back.

41
00:07:43.432 --> 00:07:47.227
What are they thinking
staying in the cave this late.


42
00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:52.357
Heavy rain is forecast
in Northern Thailand


43
00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:55.652
as the monsoon season
starts early.


44
00:07:56.612 --> 00:07:58.113
Monsoon?

45
00:07:58.197 --> 00:07:59.823
That usually starts in July.

46
00:08:00.616 --> 00:08:02.492
It can't be the monsoon.

47
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.662
That cave floods every year.

48
00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:40.571
That's Chai's bike!

49
00:08:41.573 --> 00:08:44.201
We're the parents
who called ahead.


50
00:08:44.284 --> 00:08:45.285
Have you seen the boys?

51
00:08:46.286 --> 00:08:47.830
We've looked
and can't go any further.


52
00:08:47.913 --> 00:08:49.623
The cave's flooding.

53
00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:50.832
We called the authorities.

54
00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:54.294
It's flooding.
How can the boys get out?


55
00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:56.672
I've already asked for help.

56
00:08:56.755 --> 00:08:57.839
Please wait.

57
00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.968
Let's go in and get them.

58
00:09:01.176 --> 00:09:02.719
Calm down and wait for help.

59
00:09:08.642 --> 00:09:09.643
Chai!

60
00:09:11.186 --> 00:09:12.271
Chai!

61
00:09:13.272 --> 00:09:14.314
Chai! Can you hear me?

62
00:09:14.898 --> 00:09:15.899
Chai!

63
00:09:17.109 --> 00:09:18.110
Chai!

64
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:22.322
I just started my dinner.

65
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.991
Sorry, Governor.

66
00:09:26.118 --> 00:09:28.120
Have the SEALs been deployed?

67
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:31.206
They're already
on the ground, sir.


68
00:09:47.514 --> 00:09:49.114
- Is that them there?
- Yes.


69
00:09:52.978 --> 00:09:55.230
This is Vern Unsworth.

70
00:09:57.357 --> 00:10:00.569
I'm the Governor
of the province. You are?


71
00:10:01.403 --> 00:10:03.488
Captain Arnont Sureewong.

72
00:10:04.239 --> 00:10:07.200
Navy SEALs, sir.

73
00:10:07.284 --> 00:10:08.952
Move everything to the tent.

74
00:10:09.036 --> 00:10:11.038
I need an update.

75
00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:16.585
My men will enter
with scuba gear.


76
00:10:16.668 --> 00:10:18.108
This way, please.

77
00:10:20.005 --> 00:10:23.008
This man lives nearby, sir.
He knows the cave.


78
00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.719
Hello.

79
00:10:25.802 --> 00:10:28.096
I've mapped it. All of it.

80
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.432
Now, I haven't been in
when it's flooded.


81
00:10:30.515 --> 00:10:33.769
It's a whole 'nother game.
You have to be a bit nuts.


82
00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:37.981
But, look, there's some
pretty tight corners in there.


83
00:10:38.065 --> 00:10:39.983
A real squeeze.

84
00:10:40.067 --> 00:10:41.777
But there are some
big chambers too.


85
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.212
Let me show this
to my men. Please.


86
00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:45.154
Let's go.

87
00:10:48.075 --> 00:10:50.994
Maybe I could find you
something to eat, sir?


88
00:10:51.078 --> 00:10:53.205
That would be kind.

89
00:10:53.288 --> 00:10:55.415
This could be a long night.

90
00:11:31.368 --> 00:11:33.662
Start laying guideline
from here.


91
00:11:54.099 --> 00:11:55.559
It's a deep cave,

92
00:11:55.642 --> 00:11:57.310
several kilometers long,

93
00:11:57.394 --> 00:11:59.646
with some narrow passages.

94
00:11:59.729 --> 00:12:02.441
If the boys have gone
a long way in,


95
00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:04.693
it could take
several more hours.


96
00:12:04.776 --> 00:12:06.862
But I have every confidence
in the Navy SEALs.


97
00:12:28.467 --> 00:12:30.051
Hello, Governor.

98
00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:34.848
The SEALs are coming.

99
00:12:43.273 --> 00:12:45.150
We couldn't find the boys.

100
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.529
We hit a flash flood.

101
00:12:59.623 --> 00:13:01.750
There's no visibility
or space to maneuver.


102
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.440
The currents are too strong
and shifting.


103
00:13:42.457 --> 00:13:45.394
It's been two days since the Wild Boars
football team got trapped in the cave.


104
00:13:45.418 --> 00:13:49.881
Thai authorities have activated
over one hundred government agencies.


105
00:13:49.965 --> 00:13:53.718
In an astonishing nationwide
effort to rescue the boys,


106
00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:56.972
volunteers have also joined the effort,
pumping water out of the cave.


107
00:13:58.223 --> 00:14:00.225
There is mounting
pressure on officials


108
00:14:00.308 --> 00:14:01.977
to help these boys
by any means necessary.


109
00:14:12.696 --> 00:14:13.696
Minister.

110
00:14:14.614 --> 00:14:15.824
Governor.

111
00:14:15.907 --> 00:14:17.951
Bring me up to speed.

112
00:14:18.034 --> 00:14:19.286
Pumping has begun, Minister.

113
00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:21.705
I know that.

114
00:14:21.788 --> 00:14:23.498
With the largest pumps
in the region.


115
00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:26.960
I ordered them myself.

116
00:14:27.043 --> 00:14:30.755
So far the divers have been unable
to get through as the water is so high.


117
00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:33.633
The flooded sections are very narrow
and difficult to navigate.


118
00:14:33.717 --> 00:14:34.968
The current is very strong.

119
00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:37.345
You haven't found the boys?

120
00:14:37.429 --> 00:14:39.431
And you don't know
where they are?


121
00:14:39.514 --> 00:14:41.641
Or even if they're alive?

122
00:14:41.725 --> 00:14:44.352
I know you were to be
transferred out next week


123
00:14:44.436 --> 00:14:47.188
but you'll remain here
as Governor until this is done.


124
00:15:22.766 --> 00:15:25.101
They tell me you're the guy
who knows this mountain best.


125
00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:26.519
Sure.

126
00:15:26.603 --> 00:15:31.149
You know the cave is flooded.
There are boys trapped in there.


127
00:15:31.232 --> 00:15:33.318
Who are you?

128
00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:36.696
Thanet Natisri,
I'm a water engineer from Bangkok.


129
00:15:37.614 --> 00:15:39.282
The government sent for you?

130
00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:43.328
No I just came,
like everyone else.


131
00:15:43.411 --> 00:15:46.414
There's no time to wait
for help from the officials.


132
00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:49.709
The rain water
is flooding into the cave.


133
00:15:49.793 --> 00:15:52.128
It's coming from above,
not below.


134
00:15:52.212 --> 00:15:53.880
We have to stop it getting in.

135
00:15:53.963 --> 00:15:56.883
I need to find all the sinkholes
and divert them.


136
00:16:22.992 --> 00:16:24.869
I know many like this.

137
00:16:43.638 --> 00:16:45.181
Yeah, John?

138
00:16:45.265 --> 00:16:47.201
<i>Uh, hey, Rick, you following
what's happening in Thailand?</i>


139
00:16:47.225 --> 00:16:49.144
Some kids stuck in a cave.

140
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.981
<i>Yeah, no,
not really. Why?</i>


141
00:16:53.064 --> 00:16:54.566
<i>How did they get themselves
in there?</i>


142
00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:56.568
Uh, I don't know. Doesn't say.

143
00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:59.195
Well, if they walked in,
they can walk out.


144
00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:01.656
<i>The Thai government's been
given a list of rescue divers.</i>


145
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.991
We're on the list.

146
00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.411
What cave is this?

147
00:17:06.494 --> 00:17:07.620
<i>Uh, Tham Luang.</i>

148
00:17:07.704 --> 00:17:09.765
Hey, Matthew, that'll be your mum.

149
00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:11.332
Matthew.

150
00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:13.168
Okay, okay.

151
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:14.711
Vern mapped it
a couple of years ago.


152
00:17:14.794 --> 00:17:15.879
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:17:16.379 --> 00:17:18.131
Got it. Up north.

154
00:17:18.214 --> 00:17:19.591
<i>That's the one. Yeah.</i>

155
00:17:19.674 --> 00:17:21.342
It's just a tourist cave.

156
00:17:21.426 --> 00:17:23.845
It looks easy, but Vern said
when it's flooded,


157
00:17:23.928 --> 00:17:25.138
<i>it's impossible.</i>

158
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:26.765
- Impossible for Vern.
<i>- Yeah.</i>


159
00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:28.033
Get your stuff

160
00:17:28.057 --> 00:17:29.160
- together, all right?
- Okay.


161
00:17:29.184 --> 00:17:30.602
Well, they've got teams

162
00:17:30.685 --> 00:17:31.936
climbing all over
the mountain.


163
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.372
They're drilling holes
and searching...


164
00:17:33.396 --> 00:17:34.439
Holes?

165
00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:36.649
- Rick, one second.
<i>- Drilling holes?</i>


166
00:17:36.733 --> 00:17:37.942
<i>They don't need us, John.</i>

167
00:17:38.026 --> 00:17:40.528
- Where's it this time, Dad?
- Thailand.


168
00:17:40.612 --> 00:17:41.613
You got everything?

169
00:17:41.696 --> 00:17:44.157
- Yep.
- Yeah? Give us a hug.


170
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.843
- All right. See you later.
- Come along, Matthew.


171
00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:47.535
See ya.

172
00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:49.513
Thanks, Annabel. I'll let you
know if I have to go.


173
00:17:49.537 --> 00:17:50.663
- Okay.
- Sorry.


174
00:17:51.498 --> 00:17:52.999
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, son.


175
00:17:58.755 --> 00:18:01.466
Rick, look, if you don't wanna
do it, I'll just call Jason.


176
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:04.010
Just call Jason
if you'd rather go with Jason.


177
00:18:04.093 --> 00:18:05.696
I didn't say
I'd rather go with Jason.


178
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.180
I would rather go with you.

179
00:18:07.263 --> 00:18:08.264
<i>Just to confirm,</i>

180
00:18:08.348 --> 00:18:09.933
no one's actually asked
for us yet?


181
00:18:10.016 --> 00:18:11.434
<i>No, Vern just gave them
our names</i>


182
00:18:11.518 --> 00:18:12.661
<i>and, you know,
we should be ready</i>


183
00:18:12.685 --> 00:18:15.146
<i>in case they do ask for us.
Maybe start packing</i>


184
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.397
if you think you're coming.

185
00:18:16.481 --> 00:18:17.899
<i>Hmm.</i>

186
00:18:19.609 --> 00:18:21.319
I don't even like kids.

187
00:18:21.402 --> 00:18:22.695
Okay, Rick.

188
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.690
This is a massive
rescue operation


189
00:18:31.746 --> 00:18:35.208
with over a thousand volunteers
from all over the world.


190
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:39.838
Thai volunteers are joined
by volunteers from China,


191
00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:44.217
Japan, America,
Britain and Australia.


192
00:18:57.605 --> 00:19:00.692
In order to reduce
the water levels,


193
00:19:00.775 --> 00:19:02.277
Thai military and volunteers

194
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.613
are working around the clock
to pump water from the cave.


195
00:19:05.697 --> 00:19:08.116
Due to worsening conditions
inside the cave,


196
00:19:08.199 --> 00:19:10.577
all rescue dive efforts
have been put on hold.


197
00:19:14.122 --> 00:19:16.291
Hey, guys, I'm sorry,

198
00:19:16.374 --> 00:19:17.959
but we will have to walk
from here.


199
00:19:20.837 --> 00:19:21.963
Got any custard creams left?

200
00:19:23.006 --> 00:19:24.215
Just one, okay?

201
00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:25.299
Yeah.

202
00:19:35.727 --> 00:19:37.770
Thanks.

203
00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:38.914
Did you take
two custard creams?


204
00:19:38.938 --> 00:19:40.231
No.

205
00:19:40.315 --> 00:19:41.774
Yes, you did.

206
00:19:41.858 --> 00:19:43.776
You took two at once.
You're like a child.


207
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.904
- I'm like a child?
- Okay, guys.


208
00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:48.364
It's the building on the left,
next to the laundry.


209
00:19:48.448 --> 00:19:49.925
I will get the tanks
and meet you there.


210
00:19:49.949 --> 00:19:50.992
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay?


211
00:19:55.622 --> 00:19:59.959
In World Cup Group H,
Poland beat Japan by one goal to nil.


212
00:20:13.389 --> 00:20:14.515
So, what do we do now?

213
00:20:16.768 --> 00:20:18.019
We do what we came to do.

214
00:20:19.854 --> 00:20:21.564
Go in that cave.

215
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:23.942
Seriously, I mean,

216
00:20:24.025 --> 00:20:25.777
I don't care
about the custard creams,


217
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.363
but it's like I tell my son,
I care about trust.


218
00:20:28.446 --> 00:20:29.906
And I'm disappointed, Rick.

219
00:20:29.989 --> 00:20:32.367
But that's okay, that's okay.

220
00:20:38.373 --> 00:20:39.582
The cave is closed.

221
00:20:39.666 --> 00:20:41.376
No, we're meant to go in.

222
00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:43.211
The cave is closed.

223
00:20:43.294 --> 00:20:44.730
We just flew
all the way from England.


224
00:20:45.922 --> 00:20:47.082
Can I help?

225
00:20:47.757 --> 00:20:48.757
Hello.

226
00:20:50.218 --> 00:20:52.303
I'm Rick Stanton,
this is John Volanthen.


227
00:20:52.387 --> 00:20:54.764
We've been flown in by
the Thai government to help.


228
00:20:54.847 --> 00:20:56.307
You are British army?

229
00:20:56.391 --> 00:20:58.685
No. British Cave
Rescue Council.


230
00:20:58.768 --> 00:21:00.019
We're volunteers.

231
00:21:00.103 --> 00:21:01.020
The cave is flooded.

232
00:21:01.104 --> 00:21:02.939
- Yeah, we...
- John.


233
00:21:03.022 --> 00:21:05.650
Hey, Vern, there seems
to be a problem here.


234
00:21:05.733 --> 00:21:07.652
They're telling us
the cave's closed.


235
00:21:07.735 --> 00:21:08.963
Yeah, well,
it's getting bad in there.


236
00:21:08.987 --> 00:21:10.321
They're pulling everyone out.

237
00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:12.073
These are the men you want.

238
00:21:12.156 --> 00:21:13.449
I gave the governor
their names.


239
00:21:13.533 --> 00:21:14.617
The governor sent for them?

240
00:21:15.618 --> 00:21:16.995
Sir, look at them.

241
00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:18.746
They're amateurs.

242
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.307
They'll never survive
the currents in the cave.


243
00:21:20.331 --> 00:21:21.249
No, no, no.

244
00:21:21.332 --> 00:21:23.018
They've done cave rescues
all over the world.


245
00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:24.961
Our names must be
on some list somewhere.


246
00:21:25.044 --> 00:21:26.337
I told the governor,

247
00:21:26.421 --> 00:21:28.023
- "These are the men you need."
- Look, guys,


248
00:21:28.047 --> 00:21:29.191
the children
are still in the cave, yeah?


249
00:21:29.215 --> 00:21:30.275
- Look, John...
- Yeah, but...


250
00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:31.402
- Just a sec.
- The clock is ticking.


251
00:21:31.426 --> 00:21:32.820
Look, lads,
it's just that they don't want


252
00:21:32.844 --> 00:21:34.178
foreigners dying in the cave.

253
00:21:34.262 --> 00:21:35.263
It's not a good look.

254
00:21:35.346 --> 00:21:36.889
We won't die.

255
00:21:36.973 --> 00:21:38.850
I have zero interest in dying.

256
00:21:38.933 --> 00:21:40.018
How about you, John?

257
00:21:40.101 --> 00:21:40.977
Yeah, same.

258
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.660
If the governor
sent for them...


259
00:21:43.938 --> 00:21:44.939
You can dive.

260
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.441
Thank you.

261
00:21:50.153 --> 00:21:51.753
Lads, first
it's gonna be a series


262
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:53.281
of small cascades,

263
00:21:53.364 --> 00:21:54.866
followed by
a deeper wading section


264
00:21:54.949 --> 00:21:56.075
before your first dive.

265
00:21:56.159 --> 00:21:57.660
Your best chance
is a large cave


266
00:21:57.744 --> 00:21:59.078
about two kilometers in.

267
00:22:35.323 --> 00:22:36.883
You're all right.

268
00:23:24.455 --> 00:23:26.655
I'll follow. I need a few
more minutes to fix this pump.


269
00:23:39.387 --> 00:23:41.472
The water level
is getting high.


270
00:23:41.556 --> 00:23:42.807
It's almost running.

271
00:25:25.368 --> 00:25:26.827
Let's have a look.

272
00:26:01.362 --> 00:26:02.738
Shit!

273
00:26:02.822 --> 00:26:04.302
That's it.
We better head back.


274
00:26:32.226 --> 00:26:34.270
Wait, wait. You speak English?

275
00:26:34.353 --> 00:26:36.856
I fix pump,
but water come fast.


276
00:26:36.939 --> 00:26:37.940
Bloody hell.

277
00:26:39.275 --> 00:26:40.693
We'll have to dive him out.

278
00:26:40.776 --> 00:26:42.111
- Can you swim?
- Yes.


279
00:26:42.194 --> 00:26:43.321
Give me your mask.

280
00:26:43.404 --> 00:26:44.822
I'll take him out
and come back.


281
00:26:44.905 --> 00:26:45.905
Okay.

282
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.158
Right.

283
00:26:47.241 --> 00:26:49.243
You breathe through this.

284
00:26:50.036 --> 00:26:52.455
Breathe. Okay?

285
00:26:52.538 --> 00:26:53.538
Mask.

286
00:26:56.459 --> 00:26:58.544
Face in the water.
Just try it.


287
00:26:59.628 --> 00:27:01.630
We swim together. All right?

288
00:27:02.965 --> 00:27:03.966
Here we go.

289
00:27:57.645 --> 00:27:59.438
Stop it!

290
00:27:59.522 --> 00:28:00.523
Help!

291
00:28:01.315 --> 00:28:03.109
Over here!

292
00:28:35.558 --> 00:28:37.101
That was exciting.

293
00:28:38.102 --> 00:28:39.562
Not in a good way.

294
00:28:39.645 --> 00:28:40.813
Did he make it out okay?

295
00:28:42.064 --> 00:28:43.064
Yeah.

296
00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:00.916
Hello.

297
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.002
I'm the governor
of this province.


298
00:29:03.085 --> 00:29:04.628
Grateful for your help.

299
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.466
We went as far
as we could.


300
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:10.134
Didn't find the boys.

301
00:29:10.217 --> 00:29:11.469
How far did you get?

302
00:29:11.552 --> 00:29:12.720
T-junction.

303
00:29:13.888 --> 00:29:16.891
The T-junction is the same
location my team got to.


304
00:29:16.974 --> 00:29:19.393
That's as far
as they laid their line.


305
00:29:20.394 --> 00:29:22.396
I sent for them
on good advice.


306
00:29:23.564 --> 00:29:25.691
I'm pursuing every avenue
open to me.


307
00:29:26.901 --> 00:29:28.444
Yes, Governor.

308
00:29:28.527 --> 00:29:31.739
I'll let you know when
the rescue operation can be resumed.


309
00:29:37.244 --> 00:29:38.884
I must ask, please,

310
00:29:38.954 --> 00:29:41.707
do not go in the cave again
without my permission.


311
00:29:46.712 --> 00:29:48.672
Just a sec, boys.
Sir?


312
00:29:56.847 --> 00:29:58.557
What was
all that about?


313
00:29:58.641 --> 00:30:00.851
Well, in theory,
the governor's in charge,


314
00:30:00.935 --> 00:30:03.187
but Captain Arnont's
the Navy chief on the ground


315
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.272
and he doesn't take orders
from civilians.


316
00:30:05.356 --> 00:30:07.691
Plus, the rumor is,
the governor's been sacked.


317
00:30:07.775 --> 00:30:09.336
This was supposed to have been
his last week here,


318
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.070
and now he's been ordered
to stay on.


319
00:30:11.153 --> 00:30:13.489
Just in case
they need a fall guy.


320
00:30:13.572 --> 00:30:16.700
Hmm. Hey, Vern.
What's all that?


321
00:30:16.784 --> 00:30:19.203
That's a shrine
to Princess Nang Non,


322
00:30:19.286 --> 00:30:21.288
the Sleeping Princess.

323
00:30:21.372 --> 00:30:23.165
This is her mountain.

324
00:30:23.249 --> 00:30:24.959
Nang Non mountain.

325
00:30:25.042 --> 00:30:26.770
They say when you
see it from a distance,


326
00:30:26.794 --> 00:30:29.922
it looks like
a sleeping princess.


327
00:30:30.005 --> 00:30:32.508
They say that her tears
trapped the boys.


328
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:34.969
The Sleeping Princess
is angry.


329
00:30:35.052 --> 00:30:36.136
Angry?

330
00:30:36.804 --> 00:30:38.556
What's she angry about?

331
00:30:38.639 --> 00:30:40.140
I don't know.

332
00:30:40.224 --> 00:30:42.017
It's just what
the local people say.


333
00:30:54.655 --> 00:30:57.783
Life threatening infections
are a concern.


334
00:30:57.866 --> 00:31:01.745
We need to remember that
every breath they take


335
00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:05.040
increases
carbon dioxide levels.


336
00:31:05.124 --> 00:31:08.627
As oxygen decreases,
physical exertion becomes more taxing.


337
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.802
Right here, that's their tent.

338
00:31:22.057 --> 00:31:23.309
Sam!

339
00:31:23.392 --> 00:31:24.643
Hi, Captain.

340
00:31:24.727 --> 00:31:26.395
Hey.

341
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:28.856
You're not at work?

342
00:31:29.857 --> 00:31:31.275
I took a vacation.

343
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.402
So you broke free?

344
00:31:34.903 --> 00:31:37.072
I got bored of watching you
on the news.


345
00:31:37.156 --> 00:31:39.617
Hey team, this is Saman.

346
00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.494
Saman's one of us.
He served under me for ten years.


347
00:31:42.578 --> 00:31:44.330
We chased pirates together.

348
00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:47.249
I brought my old scuba gear.

349
00:31:47.333 --> 00:31:48.167
I want to help.

350
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.627
Welcome.

351
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.878
Excuse me!

352
00:31:51.545 --> 00:31:52.963
Excuse me!

353
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:56.759
Can I talk with you please?

354
00:31:59.053 --> 00:32:00.053
Sir,

355
00:32:00.971 --> 00:32:02.473
my boy is in the cave

356
00:32:03.349 --> 00:32:05.643
and now it's flooding.

357
00:32:05.726 --> 00:32:07.686
I don't know if my son
is alive or dead.


358
00:32:09.146 --> 00:32:10.689
All I ask from you, sir,

359
00:32:12.358 --> 00:32:15.527
is to bring me his body.

360
00:32:30.334 --> 00:32:31.627
Excuse me, governor?

361
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.587
Major Charlie Hodges.
US Air Force, Okinawa.


362
00:32:33.671 --> 00:32:34.838
This is Captain Olivia Taft.

363
00:32:34.922 --> 00:32:36.090
Governor.

364
00:32:36.173 --> 00:32:38.253
We're the nearest
Special Operations Squad.


365
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.469
But we have medics,
comms, logistics experts.


366
00:32:40.552 --> 00:32:41.845
We'll do whatever we can
to help.


367
00:32:41.929 --> 00:32:43.514
Thank you.

368
00:32:43.597 --> 00:32:45.474
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


369
00:32:45.557 --> 00:32:47.559
Thank you.
Everyone!


370
00:32:47.643 --> 00:32:48.936
We're going to
get started now.


371
00:32:49.019 --> 00:32:52.690
So, we think that the boys
were heading for here.


372
00:32:52.773 --> 00:32:53.899
They call it Pattaya Beach.

373
00:32:56.026 --> 00:32:58.153
With the high water level
and the low visibility,


374
00:32:59.238 --> 00:33:01.198
and the difficulty
of the cave itself,


375
00:33:03.033 --> 00:33:06.203
our divers were not able
to reach them.


376
00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:08.914
So, now, the question is,

377
00:33:10.582 --> 00:33:11.750
when do we go back in?

378
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.461
And who is going in?

379
00:33:16.171 --> 00:33:20.134
We need the rain to stop,
and let the pumps do the work.


380
00:33:20.217 --> 00:33:21.844
And then, we go in.

381
00:33:23.178 --> 00:33:24.054
We can go in now.

382
00:33:24.138 --> 00:33:25.139
Yeah. No offense,

383
00:33:25.222 --> 00:33:27.266
but you're trained
to dive in open water,


384
00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:28.851
not confined spaces.

385
00:33:28.934 --> 00:33:31.478
Rick and I
have been diving in caves


386
00:33:31.562 --> 00:33:33.188
just like this
for 30 years now.


387
00:33:33.272 --> 00:33:34.592
It takes
a certain kind of mindset


388
00:33:34.648 --> 00:33:36.900
for the deep cave diving.

389
00:33:36.984 --> 00:33:38.986
Breathing techniques,
special ways of moving.


390
00:33:39.069 --> 00:33:40.320
It's just different.

391
00:33:43.157 --> 00:33:44.658
I'm responsible for my men.

392
00:33:45.451 --> 00:33:47.536
As for anyone else,

393
00:33:47.619 --> 00:33:49.121
that's for the governor
to decide.


394
00:34:03.802 --> 00:34:05.345
No one will go in for now.

395
00:34:05.429 --> 00:34:06.669
We'll wait for the rain
to stop.


396
00:34:06.722 --> 00:34:08.265
Thank you.

397
00:34:21.028 --> 00:34:22.589
We need to build dams
for every sinkhole.


398
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:33.040
Seems like he just showed up
on his own, sir.


399
00:34:33.123 --> 00:34:35.417
The men working with him
are local villagers.


400
00:34:37.085 --> 00:34:38.712
I don't believe we've met.

401
00:34:39.922 --> 00:34:41.122
I'm the water guy.

402
00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:43.342
You are American?

403
00:34:44.593 --> 00:34:46.887
I live in Illinois
but I'm from Bangkok.


404
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:49.014
I was in Bangkok
when I heard the news.


405
00:34:49.097 --> 00:34:51.058
I rounded up some volunteers
and here we are.


406
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.120
I am the governor.

407
00:34:55.062 --> 00:34:57.022
Tell me how you can help.

408
00:34:58.524 --> 00:34:59.900
Of course.

409
00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.070
There's a network
of mountain streams


410
00:35:03.153 --> 00:35:07.115
carrying water through all the fissures
and cracks into the cave.


411
00:35:07.199 --> 00:35:09.326
That's what's creating
the strong currents.


412
00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:13.831
If we find a way to divert these streams,
the water level will drop.


413
00:35:13.914 --> 00:35:16.750
I thought that's why we're pumping water
out of the cave below.


414
00:35:16.834 --> 00:35:19.002
No, sir.
Those pumps are useless.


415
00:35:19.086 --> 00:35:21.964
The cave is at the bottom,
water will keep running in from above.


416
00:35:22.047 --> 00:35:23.715
Can you stop that?

417
00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:25.968
We are trying.

418
00:35:27.636 --> 00:35:29.346
But there's a price to pay.

419
00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:42.234
You've all been in the cave.

420
00:35:42.317 --> 00:35:44.862
You know how the water comes
in from the mountain above.


421
00:35:44.945 --> 00:35:47.614
Now we want to
divert the water


422
00:35:47.698 --> 00:35:48.991
down the side of the mountain,

423
00:35:49.867 --> 00:35:51.368
away from the cave,

424
00:35:52.077 --> 00:35:54.246
onto your fields.

425
00:36:02.588 --> 00:36:03.922
We will lose our crop?

426
00:36:05.549 --> 00:36:06.592
Yes.

427
00:36:07.134 --> 00:36:09.011
This will save the boys?

428
00:36:11.096 --> 00:36:13.307
Honestly,
I can't promise anything.


429
00:36:14.308 --> 00:36:15.851
Um...

430
00:36:15.934 --> 00:36:18.562
But it will give the boys
a chance.


431
00:36:38.749 --> 00:36:39.833
Agreed.

432
00:36:40.417 --> 00:36:41.585
For the boys.

433
00:37:07.402 --> 00:37:08.796
<i>With this much-needed break</i>

434
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.696
<i>in the monsoon rains,</i>

435
00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.907
<i>consensus among
the many volunteers here</i>


436
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.367
<i>is that the search
for the boys</i>


437
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.119
<i>and their coach
may soon resume.</i>


438
00:37:16.203 --> 00:37:17.472
<i>The frustration
for the families, though,</i>


439
00:37:17.496 --> 00:37:19.957
<i>is that nobody seems to know
when that might be,</i>


440
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.459
<i>or indeed,
how it will take place.</i>


441
00:37:22.542 --> 00:37:24.795
<i>Nine days after they entered
this huge cave system,</i>


442
00:37:24.878 --> 00:37:26.171
<i>the questions remains</i>

443
00:37:26.254 --> 00:37:27.974
<i>as to whether the boys
can still be rescued.</i>


444
00:37:28.048 --> 00:37:29.424
Suppose they're alive
in there.


445
00:37:30.842 --> 00:37:32.678
What's it like for them?

446
00:37:34.638 --> 00:37:36.014
Why say that?

447
00:37:37.307 --> 00:37:39.226
I was just wondering.

448
00:37:45.774 --> 00:37:46.775
Huh.

449
00:37:47.484 --> 00:37:48.986
I can just about see her.

450
00:37:51.405 --> 00:37:52.906
Princess Nang Non.

451
00:37:59.037 --> 00:38:00.306
We've just received word

452
00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:04.001
that a water diversion
operation is underway.


453
00:38:04.084 --> 00:38:06.211
Volunteers are building dams
and positioning pipes


454
00:38:06.294 --> 00:38:08.046
in order to redirect the water

455
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.382
from the mountain
into the surrounding fields.


456
00:38:10.465 --> 00:38:12.384
Rescue teams
hope that this will limit


457
00:38:12.467 --> 00:38:14.469
the flow of water
into the cave


458
00:38:14.553 --> 00:38:16.197
and allow the pumps to reduce
the water levels inside.


459
00:38:17.347 --> 00:38:20.600
I asked if Kruba could come
and he's here already.


460
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:17.574
Lek, Lek.

461
00:39:18.658 --> 00:39:19.778
Can you take these to Kruba?

462
00:39:24.206 --> 00:39:26.291
Excuse me.

463
00:39:26.374 --> 00:39:28.460
Kruba, please could you
bless these for me?


464
00:39:44.017 --> 00:39:45.017
Thank you.

465
00:39:50.607 --> 00:39:54.361
I'm told the pumps are working
and the rain has stopped.


466
00:39:54.444 --> 00:39:56.071
When can the SEALs go in again?

467
00:39:56.154 --> 00:39:58.949
For the waters to recede,

468
00:39:59.032 --> 00:40:00.909
at least twenty-four hours.

469
00:40:02.577 --> 00:40:05.664
The British divers
are ready to go in.


470
00:40:05.747 --> 00:40:09.251
Our team is preparing.

471
00:40:09.334 --> 00:40:11.586
I think it's too risky
to let them in now.


472
00:40:13.171 --> 00:40:15.817
They're amongst the best in the world
at diving in these conditions.


473
00:40:15.841 --> 00:40:17.968
Let's use them as scouts

474
00:40:18.635 --> 00:40:20.095
and see what happens?

475
00:40:21.138 --> 00:40:22.556
Sir,

476
00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:24.516
the Minister
requests an update.


477
00:40:42.576 --> 00:40:43.618
Video.

478
00:40:43.702 --> 00:40:45.328
If you get past T-junction.

479
00:40:49.249 --> 00:40:51.877
Please, take care.

480
00:42:01.238 --> 00:42:02.447
Pattaya Beach.

481
00:42:03.949 --> 00:42:04.949
Hello!

482
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:07.910
Hello!

483
00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:19.923
All right.

484
00:42:20.006 --> 00:42:21.006
I'll keep left.

485
00:42:21.716 --> 00:42:22.968
Feel out for bodies.

486
00:43:38.793 --> 00:43:40.295
You smell that?

487
00:43:44.049 --> 00:43:45.133
Yeah.

488
00:43:48.887 --> 00:43:49.887
Okay.

489
00:43:55.769 --> 00:43:56.811
Nearly out of line.

490
00:44:06.071 --> 00:44:07.572
Hey.

491
00:44:12.035 --> 00:44:13.036
They're here.

492
00:44:14.704 --> 00:44:16.122
How many?

493
00:44:25.256 --> 00:44:26.256
Hello?

494
00:44:27.217 --> 00:44:28.361
- Hello.
- Hello!


495
00:44:28.385 --> 00:44:29.761
- Hello.
- Hello.


496
00:44:29.844 --> 00:44:31.221
How have they done that?

497
00:44:33.431 --> 00:44:34.349
Thank you.

498
00:44:34.432 --> 00:44:36.184
English. English.

499
00:44:36.267 --> 00:44:37.394
English?

500
00:44:38.937 --> 00:44:41.606
Thank you.

501
00:44:41.689 --> 00:44:43.274
How many of you?

502
00:44:43.358 --> 00:44:45.318
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?


503
00:44:45.402 --> 00:44:46.569
They're all alive.

504
00:44:46.653 --> 00:44:47.737
- Thirteen?
- Yes.


505
00:44:47.821 --> 00:44:48.821
Brilliant!

506
00:44:49.406 --> 00:44:50.532
Brilliant.

507
00:44:55.912 --> 00:44:58.832
Uh, can we go out now?

508
00:45:00.166 --> 00:45:01.418
Uh, no, not today.

509
00:45:01.501 --> 00:45:03.044
No, there are just two of us.

510
00:45:03.128 --> 00:45:04.295
We must dive.

511
00:45:04.379 --> 00:45:06.631
But many people are coming.
It's okay.


512
00:45:06.714 --> 00:45:08.591
We are the first,
but... But...


513
00:45:08.675 --> 00:45:10.427
But many will come. Many more.

514
00:45:12.262 --> 00:45:13.280
You've been here ten days.

515
00:45:13.304 --> 00:45:15.306
Ten days!
You are very strong.


516
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.142
Very strong.

517
00:45:20.562 --> 00:45:22.564
We are hungry.

518
00:45:22.647 --> 00:45:24.023
I know, I know. I know.

519
00:45:24.107 --> 00:45:26.484
I understand.

520
00:45:26.568 --> 00:45:28.653
Okay, go back. We will come.

521
00:45:29.863 --> 00:45:31.364
Go on back.

522
00:45:34.993 --> 00:45:36.953
Uh, what day
you come and help us?


523
00:45:37.036 --> 00:45:38.036
Uh...

524
00:45:40.498 --> 00:45:42.250
- We help tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?


525
00:45:42.333 --> 00:45:43.394
There are more divers.

526
00:45:43.418 --> 00:45:44.919
- Thai divers.
- Thai?


527
00:45:45.003 --> 00:45:48.840
We'll come tomorrow with food
and doctors, and everything.


528
00:45:48.923 --> 00:45:50.300
Don't, John.
You don't know that.


529
00:45:56.097 --> 00:45:59.350
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.


530
00:46:01.311 --> 00:46:02.353
You are very brave.

531
00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.981
How have you stayed so strong?

532
00:46:05.064 --> 00:46:07.525
We are team

533
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:09.444
and we help each other.

534
00:46:09.527 --> 00:46:11.488
And our coach help us.

535
00:46:11.571 --> 00:46:12.405
Coach.

536
00:46:14.199 --> 00:46:16.135
I offer my most sincere apologies
for leading the boys into danger.


537
00:46:17.535 --> 00:46:20.580
It's not true! Coach helped us!
We love our coach! He's the best!


538
00:46:20.663 --> 00:46:25.251
It is because
of our coach we stay strong.


539
00:46:25.335 --> 00:46:27.921
He teach us to, uh, meditate.

540
00:46:31.216 --> 00:46:33.551
- And, uh, we pray.
- You pray?


541
00:46:33.635 --> 00:46:36.179
- Yes, yes.
- I bet you do. All right.


542
00:46:37.472 --> 00:46:39.599
How...
How did you find us?


543
00:46:46.731 --> 00:46:47.732
We dig.

544
00:46:51.402 --> 00:46:52.402
We dig.

545
00:46:58.076 --> 00:46:59.410
This is to get out?

546
00:47:04.874 --> 00:47:05.874
Good work.

547
00:47:09.212 --> 00:47:10.338
Uh...

548
00:47:10.421 --> 00:47:13.258
We hear a sound in the cave.

549
00:47:13.341 --> 00:47:15.552
We are very scared.

550
00:47:15.635 --> 00:47:16.511
No need
to be scared now.


551
00:47:16.594 --> 00:47:19.097
It's just water.
It's just the cave.


552
00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.099
I hear it too, it's just...

553
00:47:21.182 --> 00:47:22.183
John...

554
00:47:23.851 --> 00:47:25.353
We should get back.

555
00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:28.480
All right.

556
00:47:30.149 --> 00:47:31.149
Right.

557
00:47:42.245 --> 00:47:43.246
Here.

558
00:47:46.124 --> 00:47:47.124
The batteries are fresh.

559
00:47:49.043 --> 00:47:50.086
Thank you.

560
00:47:50.169 --> 00:47:51.546
You stay strong.

561
00:47:59.304 --> 00:48:00.304
Good luck.

562
00:48:05.143 --> 00:48:06.412
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.


563
00:49:06.537 --> 00:49:07.789
Hello!

564
00:49:08.373 --> 00:49:09.916
- Hello!
- Hey!


565
00:49:12.877 --> 00:49:14.462
We found the boys.

566
00:49:14.545 --> 00:49:15.672
They're alive.

567
00:49:16.964 --> 00:49:18.049
Careful who sees that.

568
00:49:19.967 --> 00:49:21.260
The old men found the boys!

569
00:49:28.976 --> 00:49:30.162
Do we know how many?

570
00:49:30.186 --> 00:49:31.062
<i>How many of you?</i>

571
00:49:31.145 --> 00:49:32.605
They found the boys!

572
00:49:32.689 --> 00:49:33.606
<i>Thirteen?</i>

573
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:34.607
<i>They're all alive.</i>

574
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:35.525
I can't believe it.

575
00:49:36.526 --> 00:49:37.402
They're alive!

576
00:49:37.485 --> 00:49:38.504
- <i>Thirteen?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>


577
00:49:38.528 --> 00:49:39.445
<i>Brilliant!</i>

578
00:49:50.581 --> 00:49:51.791
They found the boys.

579
00:49:52.417 --> 00:49:53.626
Everyone's alive.

580
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:54.711
They're safe.

581
00:49:54.794 --> 00:49:56.045
Everyone's alive?

582
00:50:04.804 --> 00:50:06.055
They found the boys!

583
00:50:06.723 --> 00:50:07.974
They found the boys!

584
00:50:36.002 --> 00:50:38.337
Oh, shit.

585
00:50:38.421 --> 00:50:39.756
Everybody knows.

586
00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:40.965
That didn't take long.

587
00:50:45.678 --> 00:50:47.930
Rick, John,
how are the boys doing?


588
00:50:48.014 --> 00:50:49.515
Where did you find the boys?

589
00:51:02.945 --> 00:51:04.447
Are there any injuries?

590
00:51:12.121 --> 00:51:13.307
<i>We're going to bring you</i>

591
00:51:13.331 --> 00:51:14.373
<i>some breaking news now.</i>

592
00:51:14.457 --> 00:51:17.585
<i>Reports coming in
from Chiang Rai, Thailand.</i>


593
00:51:17.668 --> 00:51:19.253
<i>Specialist cave rescue divers</i>

594
00:51:19.337 --> 00:51:22.048
<i>Rick Stanton,
a retired firefighter,</i>


595
00:51:22.131 --> 00:51:25.092
<i>and John Volanthen,
an IT consultant,</i>


596
00:51:25.176 --> 00:51:28.554
<i>have found the missing boys
and their football coach.</i>


597
00:51:28.638 --> 00:51:30.139
<i>Last seen nine days ago</i>

598
00:51:30.223 --> 00:51:32.850
<i>and presumed trapped
in the flooded caves,</i>


599
00:51:32.934 --> 00:51:35.144
<i>all twelve boys
and their coach</i>


600
00:51:35.228 --> 00:51:37.605
<i>are now confirmed to be alive.</i>

601
00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.249
Christ,
there's more of 'em now.


602
00:51:56.332 --> 00:51:58.209
Come on, we should just go.

603
00:51:58.292 --> 00:51:59.710
Let's go. Straight to the van.

604
00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.433
Let's move you back inside.

605
00:52:14.517 --> 00:52:16.310
Back inside. Back inside.

606
00:52:16.394 --> 00:52:17.645
Just head back in.

607
00:52:17.728 --> 00:52:19.897
Come on, guys, let's just give
'em some space, okay?


608
00:52:19.981 --> 00:52:20.999
Thank you. Been a long day.

609
00:52:21.023 --> 00:52:22.376
Can you please comment
on US involvement?


610
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.651
Thank you very much.

611
00:52:27.697 --> 00:52:29.407
- Thank you.
- Okay.


612
00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:31.284
Thank you so much.
You found them.


613
00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:35.121
The news guys
can be a pain in the butt.


614
00:52:35.204 --> 00:52:37.456
You just gotta
handle them right.


615
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:39.333
What do you want me
to tell them?


616
00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:41.711
"We found the boys.
Now let's all watch 'em die."


617
00:52:41.794 --> 00:52:43.921
Okay, Rick, take it easy.

618
00:52:44.005 --> 00:52:45.673
I'm just telling it
like it is.


619
00:52:45.756 --> 00:52:48.009
All this water pumping,

620
00:52:48.092 --> 00:52:50.678
flooding fields,
praying to shrines,


621
00:52:50.761 --> 00:52:52.263
it's bullshit!

622
00:52:52.346 --> 00:52:53.346
I'm not having it.

623
00:52:55.016 --> 00:52:56.684
The Thai SEALs
are going in tomorrow.


624
00:52:56.767 --> 00:52:58.686
Those boys
are never coming out.


625
00:53:02.106 --> 00:53:03.106
Never.

626
00:53:07.945 --> 00:53:10.656
Our most experienced divers
are going to...


627
00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:14.702
No, sir.
It's not about your divers.


628
00:53:14.785 --> 00:53:17.371
We brought a man out
on our first dive,


629
00:53:17.455 --> 00:53:18.535
and he completely panicked.

630
00:53:18.581 --> 00:53:19.581
Almost drowned.

631
00:53:22.001 --> 00:53:24.670
And that was
a very short swim.


632
00:53:24.754 --> 00:53:27.590
You try and dive those kids
the whole way,


633
00:53:27.673 --> 00:53:29.926
all you'll be bringing out
is dead bodies!


634
00:53:37.224 --> 00:53:40.019
Governor! Governor! Governor!

635
00:53:40.102 --> 00:53:41.687
Okay, let's get you guys
out of here.


636
00:53:41.771 --> 00:53:42.980
Okay. Come on.

637
00:53:59.622 --> 00:54:01.374
This is exactly
what I didn't want.


638
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.169
Well,
you knew we'd find them.


639
00:54:05.252 --> 00:54:06.612
I didn't expect
to find them alive.


640
00:54:07.296 --> 00:54:08.296
Well, it's done now.

641
00:54:24.438 --> 00:54:26.399
Okay, can we go, Bas, please?

642
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:02.350
Sorry.

643
00:55:03.436 --> 00:55:04.520
It's okay.

644
00:55:09.567 --> 00:55:11.360
When will they come back?

645
00:55:11.861 --> 00:55:14.030
Maybe they won't come.

646
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:20.411
They'll come when they're ready.
We must be ready.


647
00:55:20.953 --> 00:55:23.664
Fear is created in our minds.

648
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:28.710
Close your eyes.

649
00:55:36.135 --> 00:55:38.596
Let your mind be at peace.

650
00:55:40.973 --> 00:55:43.434
Feel the air
you breathe in and out.


651
00:55:50.566 --> 00:55:51.942
Breathe in.

652
00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:54.528
Breathe out.

653
00:55:54.987 --> 00:55:56.113
Slowly.

654
00:56:00.826 --> 00:56:04.497
We are standing by at the basecamp
of the rescue mission.


655
00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.333
Rescuers are attempting to find
alternative ways to reach the cave.


656
00:56:07.416 --> 00:56:09.752
Experts believe the boys
will never survive


657
00:56:09.835 --> 00:56:12.338
three months of monsoon rains
and flooding.


658
00:56:15.966 --> 00:56:19.136
Still using the same Scubapro regulator
from my time.


659
00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:28.270
On your first dive,

660
00:56:28.354 --> 00:56:30.272
you made it to the T-junction?

661
00:56:30.356 --> 00:56:31.524
I did, yeah.

662
00:56:33.567 --> 00:56:36.278
Do you want a briefing
on the rest of the way?


663
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.740
Yeah, please. Come in.

664
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:46.372
You made it here.

665
00:56:47.331 --> 00:56:50.751
You have
a 250-meter dive here,


666
00:56:50.835 --> 00:56:52.253
with a narrow rift,

667
00:56:52.336 --> 00:56:55.381
barely shoulder-wide,
to Chamber 7.


668
00:56:55.464 --> 00:56:57.091
Then you have to de-kit

669
00:56:57.174 --> 00:57:00.594
and carry your gear
over a long rock shelf


670
00:57:00.678 --> 00:57:02.138
to get to Pattaya Beach.

671
00:57:02.221 --> 00:57:03.347
Then comes a tough dive.

672
00:57:04.932 --> 00:57:07.685
It's a long, shallow tunnel,

673
00:57:07.768 --> 00:57:11.981
bit more twisty than this,

674
00:57:12.064 --> 00:57:15.109
No visibility. Pulling against
very strong currents.


675
00:57:15.192 --> 00:57:16.902
No headroom at all.

676
00:57:16.986 --> 00:57:19.697
And there's undercuts
on all the bends.


677
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.157
They're very, very dangerous.

678
00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.493
So, you must always keep
to the wider side of the line,


679
00:57:24.577 --> 00:57:26.704
or you'll get trapped.

680
00:57:26.787 --> 00:57:29.248
At the end of that,
you'll reach the boys.


681
00:57:30.583 --> 00:57:33.294
And it's
a very physical dive.


682
00:57:33.377 --> 00:57:35.212
So, try and save
two-thirds of your air


683
00:57:35.296 --> 00:57:36.439
going in,
so you can make it back.


684
00:57:36.463 --> 00:57:37.965
We will get there.

685
00:57:38.048 --> 00:57:38.883
We'll reach the boys today.

686
00:57:38.966 --> 00:57:39.884
Yeah.

687
00:57:39.967 --> 00:57:41.302
Let's pack up.

688
00:57:41.385 --> 00:57:42.761
Best of luck, Kiet.

689
00:57:42.845 --> 00:57:43.845
Thank you.

690
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:47.016
Thank you.

691
00:57:48.225 --> 00:57:49.393
Good luck.

692
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:52.438
They'll do a good job.

693
00:57:53.063 --> 00:57:54.648
Those are our boys in there.

694
00:57:54.732 --> 00:57:56.358
Hmm.

695
00:57:56.442 --> 00:57:58.027
Look, I know
your men are tough,


696
00:57:59.612 --> 00:58:01.280
but it's not gonna be easy
for them.


697
00:59:41.505 --> 00:59:42.548
Navy SEALs.

698
00:59:48.512 --> 00:59:50.889
Not bad for eleven days
without food.


699
00:59:50.973 --> 00:59:53.267
The boys in the north,
they're tough.


700
00:59:54.852 --> 00:59:57.604
We have a little food and batteries.

701
01:00:03.527 --> 01:00:04.945
Two bites each.

702
01:00:05.029 --> 01:00:06.989
We must save them for later.

703
01:00:15.122 --> 01:00:16.122
Coach.

704
01:00:16.623 --> 01:00:18.167
I'm a doctor.

705
01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:19.918
I'm going to check the boys.

706
01:00:24.965 --> 01:00:25.799
What's your name?

707
01:00:25.883 --> 01:00:26.717
Arm.

708
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.800
Arm.

709
01:00:29.928 --> 01:00:31.055
You're very strong.

710
01:00:45.944 --> 01:00:46.945
Kiet.

711
01:00:48.822 --> 01:00:51.408
The oxygen in the cave
is below twenty.


712
01:00:54.495 --> 01:00:55.829
Jay.

713
01:00:55.913 --> 01:00:57.998
We only have enough air
for one of us to get back.


714
01:00:58.082 --> 01:01:00.501
We used more tanks
than we planned on.


715
01:01:02.127 --> 01:01:03.879
Take it and return to base.

716
01:01:05.839 --> 01:01:07.759
Report the oxygen meter
is close to the red zone.


717
01:01:13.097 --> 01:01:14.257
You understand the situation?

718
01:01:19.895 --> 01:01:21.730
We're staying here with you.

719
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.451
Bring Jay some water.

720
01:01:35.494 --> 01:01:36.954
He's cramping!

721
01:01:53.512 --> 01:01:57.683
Now you see why the Minister
left me in charge.


722
01:02:05.357 --> 01:02:08.277
Now the Navy SEALs
have reached the boys.


723
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.780
They will support the boys,

724
01:02:11.864 --> 01:02:15.075
as we prepare for next stage
of the rescue.


725
01:02:16.785 --> 01:02:19.204
I give my word to everyone,

726
01:02:19.288 --> 01:02:22.583
the boys will come out safely.

727
01:02:40.517 --> 01:02:41.517
Governor, sir.

728
01:02:42.019 --> 01:02:43.479
Excuse me, Governor.

729
01:02:43.562 --> 01:02:45.898
How can I help?

730
01:02:45.981 --> 01:02:47.858
Can I speak
with the Governor please?


731
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:51.153
The Governor is busy.
I can help you.


732
01:02:52.988 --> 01:02:56.617
Our families are Shan.
We don't have ID cards.


733
01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.285
Will they still help our boys?

734
01:02:58.368 --> 01:02:59.953
Will they rescue them too?

735
01:03:00.037 --> 01:03:01.389
Is everything okay?

736
01:03:01.413 --> 01:03:03.099
Well, she's afraid
her boy won't be rescued.


737
01:03:03.123 --> 01:03:05.250
They are Shan from Myanmar,
just over the border.


738
01:03:05.334 --> 01:03:06.251
Stateless.

739
01:03:08.253 --> 01:03:12.466
Don't worry, your son will be rescued
from the cave with all the others.


740
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:15.511
You should be proud of your son.
He's been very patient.


741
01:03:16.887 --> 01:03:18.013
Governor!

742
01:03:19.389 --> 01:03:21.391
It's been twelve days already.

743
01:03:21.475 --> 01:03:23.852
Inside it's dark and cold
with no food.


744
01:03:23.936 --> 01:03:25.938
How long can the boys
be patient?


745
01:03:26.021 --> 01:03:27.439
When are you getting them out?

746
01:03:28.774 --> 01:03:30.376
There are three SEALs
staying with the boys.


747
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.653
We're planning to send food in.

748
01:03:33.654 --> 01:03:34.894
I understand how you must feel.

749
01:03:36.156 --> 01:03:37.533
How can you understand?

750
01:03:38.784 --> 01:03:40.827
Is your son going to die?

751
01:03:59.263 --> 01:04:01.640
Somebody's gonna have to
come up with something.


752
01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:07.521
Rick.

753
01:04:07.604 --> 01:04:09.022
Whoa. What are you thinking?

754
01:04:12.442 --> 01:04:14.611
Just a crazy idea.

755
01:04:15.404 --> 01:04:16.697
So tell me.

756
01:04:18.824 --> 01:04:20.284
Rick, crazy is better
than nothing.


757
01:04:20.367 --> 01:04:21.368
We've got nothing.

758
01:04:22.202 --> 01:04:23.202
We call Harry.

759
01:04:24.705 --> 01:04:25.705
- Harry?
- Mmm.


760
01:04:26.999 --> 01:04:28.083
Doctor Harris.

761
01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.638
- That's brilliant.
- Mmm.


762
01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.807
Or insane.

763
01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.100
Or both.

764
01:04:51.607 --> 01:04:52.816
Don't know if he'd do it.

765
01:04:52.899 --> 01:04:54.484
I... I don't know the man,

766
01:04:55.402 --> 01:04:56.695
but, I mean...

767
01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.866
I bet he'd come if he thought
it was just to lend a hand.


768
01:05:05.287 --> 01:05:06.287
Hmm.

769
01:05:07.205 --> 01:05:09.207
He might buy that.

770
01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:10.292
He's a good diver.

771
01:05:10.834 --> 01:05:11.834
Yeah.

772
01:05:14.129 --> 01:05:15.631
We could use
a couple more divers


773
01:05:15.714 --> 01:05:17.507
who can handle
rescue work anyway.


774
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:19.843
I was thinking Jason.
You know?


775
01:05:19.926 --> 01:05:21.094
If he's not too pissed off

776
01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:22.488
that he hasn't
been asked already.


777
01:05:24.306 --> 01:05:25.682
Maybe Chris Jewell.

778
01:05:28.101 --> 01:05:29.811
You think
Chris will be up to it?


779
01:05:29.895 --> 01:05:31.897
- Everyone says he's excellent.
- Mmm-hmm.


780
01:05:32.939 --> 01:05:34.650
Jason says he's strong.

781
01:05:34.733 --> 01:05:36.777
Of course, he's never done
a rescue like this.


782
01:05:37.944 --> 01:05:38.945
I'll call him.

783
01:05:40.197 --> 01:05:41.281
- Yeah?
- Okay.


784
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.880
Chris, let me show you.

785
01:05:56.963 --> 01:05:59.633
So, you are carrying
one meal a day


786
01:05:59.716 --> 01:06:01.218
for one week
for everyone in the cave.


787
01:06:01.301 --> 01:06:02.636
- All right. Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.


788
01:06:11.186 --> 01:06:15.023
Jason, keep an eye
on Chris, yeah?


789
01:06:15.107 --> 01:06:16.292
Yeah.
He'll be all right.


790
01:06:16.316 --> 01:06:18.318
He's young.
Remember young, Rick?


791
01:06:18.402 --> 01:06:20.362
I'm not that far behind.

792
01:06:52.853 --> 01:06:54.354
We have food.

793
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:27.830
Thought the kids might like to
write back to their parents.


794
01:07:28.221 --> 01:07:29.221
Yeah.

795
01:07:29.264 --> 01:07:30.557
Good. Thank you.

796
01:07:35.645 --> 01:07:36.813
Paper to write letters.

797
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:42.819
It's strange.

798
01:07:42.903 --> 01:07:45.405
The parents thanking me
for taking care of their children.


799
01:07:46.656 --> 01:07:48.825
I thought they would blame me.

800
01:07:50.911 --> 01:07:52.496
No one blames you, Coach.

801
01:08:00.921 --> 01:08:02.315
Somebody
get these to their parents.


802
01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:03.215
Notes from the boys.

803
01:08:03.298 --> 01:08:04.298
Okay.

804
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:08.470
So, did I pass?

805
01:08:08.553 --> 01:08:10.430
- What?
- Did I pass?


806
01:08:10.514 --> 01:08:12.474
No, you were terrible.

807
01:08:12.557 --> 01:08:14.077
- You did great. You did great.
- Good.


808
01:08:14.768 --> 01:08:17.312
Well, that's quite a dive.

809
01:08:17.395 --> 01:08:19.635
How the hell do you think
we're gonna get those kids out?


810
01:08:20.649 --> 01:08:22.067
We're working on it.

811
01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:26.923
<i>Just
seconds left on the clock.</i>


812
01:08:26.947 --> 01:08:28.299
<i>Neymar couldn't do it
with that last check.</i>


813
01:08:28.323 --> 01:08:29.675
<i>And that's it,
the whistle's blown.</i>


814
01:08:29.699 --> 01:08:31.409
<i>Belgium beat Brazil.</i>

815
01:08:31.493 --> 01:08:33.662
<i>The favorites have been
knocked out of the World Cup.</i>


816
01:08:33.745 --> 01:08:35.065
<i>Belgium are through
to the semi...</i>


817
01:08:36.456 --> 01:08:37.582
I'll get the bags.

818
01:08:37.666 --> 01:08:38.917
Thanks, Bas.

819
01:08:40.126 --> 01:08:41.294
Hey, Harry.

820
01:08:42.504 --> 01:08:44.130
Glad you made it.

821
01:08:45.882 --> 01:08:46.758
Mate, thanks
for bringing me in.


822
01:08:46.842 --> 01:08:48.093
Oh, sure.

823
01:08:48.176 --> 01:08:50.220
- Good to meet you, Harry.
- Well, what a pleasure.


824
01:08:50.303 --> 01:08:51.739
- How was the flight?
- Oh, that was pretty good.


825
01:08:51.763 --> 01:08:54.641
It's just, gettin' the permits
is a bloody hassle.


826
01:08:54.724 --> 01:08:55.910
You wanna see the cave?

827
01:08:55.934 --> 01:08:57.310
Yeah.
That's what I'm here for.


828
01:08:57.394 --> 01:08:59.114
- Come on, then.
- All right.


829
01:08:59.896 --> 01:09:00.981
The families,

830
01:09:01.064 --> 01:09:03.441
they've been here
since day one.


831
01:09:03.525 --> 01:09:05.193
Oh, imagine what they're
going through.


832
01:09:05.277 --> 01:09:07.612
We managed to bring some
letters to them from the kids.


833
01:09:07.696 --> 01:09:08.697
Oh, yeah?

834
01:09:13.285 --> 01:09:16.371
And in about 2.5k,
there they are.


835
01:09:17.914 --> 01:09:18.957
That's it.

836
01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:22.878
So, who else
answered the call?


837
01:09:22.961 --> 01:09:24.254
Who else you got here?

838
01:09:24.337 --> 01:09:26.190
Oh, there's divers coming in
from all over the place.


839
01:09:26.214 --> 01:09:28.508
We've got Jason Mallinson
with us and Chris Jewell.


840
01:09:28.592 --> 01:09:30.135
Wow.

841
01:09:30.218 --> 01:09:31.386
The Awesome Foursome.

842
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.230
I'm not in the same league
as you guys, but...


843
01:09:38.602 --> 01:09:40.979
But you've got a skill

844
01:09:41.062 --> 01:09:42.522
none of the rest
of us have, Harry.


845
01:09:44.691 --> 01:09:45.901
What's that?

846
01:09:45.984 --> 01:09:47.864
Well, he's talkin' about
your area of expertise.


847
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:51.239
I'm an anesthetist.

848
01:09:51.323 --> 01:09:52.407
Right.

849
01:09:54.492 --> 01:09:55.619
No.

850
01:09:57.412 --> 01:09:58.412
No!

851
01:09:59.205 --> 01:10:00.540
No, no, no. No.

852
01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:03.543
It's their only chance.

853
01:10:03.627 --> 01:10:05.587
Rick, it's insane.

854
01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:07.881
It's unethical. It's...

855
01:10:07.964 --> 01:10:09.716
It's illegal, all right?

856
01:10:09.799 --> 01:10:11.509
And anyway,
it just wouldn't work.


857
01:10:11.593 --> 01:10:13.362
Well, you don't know that.
It's never been done before.


858
01:10:13.386 --> 01:10:14.638
No, you'll kill 'em.

859
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.516
They're gonna die anyway.

860
01:10:21.645 --> 01:10:22.854
Look, I mean...

861
01:10:24.814 --> 01:10:25.941
we've tried.

862
01:10:26.024 --> 01:10:28.026
We... We've thought
of everything.


863
01:10:29.486 --> 01:10:31.738
Yeah, so you called
Doctor Harry.


864
01:10:35.408 --> 01:10:39.204
I didn't come here
to kill kids, Rick.


865
01:10:39.287 --> 01:10:41.414
I came here
to help you save 'em.


866
01:10:41.498 --> 01:10:42.958
- Okay.
- Yeah?


867
01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:44.501
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.


868
01:10:44.584 --> 01:10:46.795
I mean, we're...
We're just desperate.


869
01:10:46.878 --> 01:10:47.963
- It's a bad idea.
- Yeah.


870
01:10:48.046 --> 01:10:50.173
- It's the only idea.
- Leave it, Rick.


871
01:10:50.256 --> 01:10:51.508
Yeah. Harry's the expert.

872
01:10:51.591 --> 01:10:53.591
If he says it can't be done,
then it can't be done.


873
01:10:56.846 --> 01:10:58.348
Anything else I can do,

874
01:10:58.431 --> 01:10:59.975
- I will do.
- Sure.


875
01:11:00.058 --> 01:11:01.977
Obviously, I took an oath,
and I...


876
01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.103
Understood.

877
01:11:03.186 --> 01:11:04.729
- We'll just keep exploring.
- Yeah?


878
01:11:04.813 --> 01:11:06.013
- Yeah. Keep exploring.
- Yeah.


879
01:11:06.064 --> 01:11:07.541
It's good to have you
on board, Harry.


880
01:11:07.565 --> 01:11:08.565
Okay.

881
01:11:15.448 --> 01:11:17.117
Oh, Rick.

882
01:11:18.159 --> 01:11:20.620
As the oxygen level decreases
in the cave,


883
01:11:20.704 --> 01:11:23.957
Thai Navy SEALs are doubling their efforts
to help the trapped boys.


884
01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.003
The air we breathe contains about
twenty-one percent oxygen.


885
01:11:28.086 --> 01:11:30.630
The level in the cave
is less than sixteen percent.


886
01:11:32.298 --> 01:11:33.133
Saman.

887
01:11:33.216 --> 01:11:34.092
You okay?

888
01:11:35.927 --> 01:11:37.738
Thanks for letting me
take wetsuits to the boys.


889
01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.056
I'm happy
you could lend a hand.


890
01:11:40.682 --> 01:11:41.891
I'll help.

891
01:11:57.615 --> 01:11:58.825
Thanks Saman.

892
01:11:58.908 --> 01:12:00.076
Mmm.

893
01:16:35.184 --> 01:16:36.578
<i>The recent death</i>

894

898
01:16:44.569 --> 01:16:45.862
As for Saman's funeral,

899
01:16:45.945 --> 01:16:47.673
the government will arrange
a funeral with full honors.

909
01:17:16.351 --> 01:17:18.353
There will be
no more Navy divers


910
01:17:18.436 --> 01:17:22.023
going beyond Chamber 3
until further notice.


911
01:17:37.789 --> 01:17:39.248
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

912
01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:41.959
Hi, hun.

913
01:17:43.169 --> 01:17:44.420
Jesus Christ.

914
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:56.391
Hey, Matthew. It's Dad.

915
01:17:56.474 --> 01:17:58.476
<i>Dad!
Are you coming home?</i>


916
01:18:00.228 --> 01:18:02.563
Uh, not for a few days yet.

917
01:18:02.647 --> 01:18:04.816
<i>We heard someone died
out there.</i>


918
01:18:04.899 --> 01:18:06.818
Yeah, yeah,
one of the Thai divers.


919
01:18:06.901 --> 01:18:09.737
A fellow named Saman.
He was...


920
01:18:09.821 --> 01:18:13.241
He was just
helping out, and...


921
01:18:13.324 --> 01:18:15.451
Yeah, yeah, it's sad.

922
01:18:16.619 --> 01:18:19.038
<i>Do you think
you'll get the boys out?</i>


923
01:18:19.122 --> 01:18:20.289
We will if we can.

924
01:18:21.541 --> 01:18:24.168
We're just trying
to figure it out.


925
01:18:24.252 --> 01:18:27.630
I mean, it's complicated,

926
01:18:27.713 --> 01:18:29.833
but we're trying...
We're trying to figure it out now.


927
01:18:31.467 --> 01:18:35.138
Uh, anyway,
how are things with you?


928
01:18:35.221 --> 01:18:36.556
You doin' okay?

929
01:18:40.268 --> 01:18:41.644
Do you want one?

930
01:18:41.727 --> 01:18:43.729
Uh, no.

931
01:18:43.813 --> 01:18:47.024
I just found out my dad's been
taken to a hospital.


932
01:18:47.108 --> 01:18:48.609
So, they're just running
a few tests.


933
01:18:48.693 --> 01:18:50.319
His heart's never been
very good.


934
01:18:51.654 --> 01:18:53.489
Sorry to hear about that.

935
01:18:53.573 --> 01:18:55.283
He's pretty tough.

936
01:18:56.242 --> 01:18:57.702
He's made it to 88.

937
01:18:59.203 --> 01:19:01.330
Um, listen.

938
01:19:05.251 --> 01:19:06.752
If we had the right backup,

939
01:19:08.087 --> 01:19:10.339
maybe, just maybe

940
01:19:10.423 --> 01:19:13.426
one or two or three,
if we're lucky,


941
01:19:13.509 --> 01:19:15.511
of those kids
might just make it through.


942
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:20.266
But you're talking about
a five-hour dive.


943
01:19:20.349 --> 01:19:21.809
- Right.
- That means that


944
01:19:21.893 --> 01:19:24.937
they're gonna have to have
top-up shots along the way.


945
01:19:25.021 --> 01:19:26.856
And then you got
the saliva problem.


946
01:19:26.939 --> 01:19:28.274
Even if the masks hold,

947
01:19:28.357 --> 01:19:29.400
there's a very good chance

948
01:19:29.484 --> 01:19:30.669
they're gonna choke,
all right?


949
01:19:30.693 --> 01:19:32.361
The whole thing is insane.

950
01:19:32.445 --> 01:19:34.071
I don't even know
why I'm saying it.


951
01:19:34.155 --> 01:19:35.781
'Cause a man's already died.

952
01:19:37.992 --> 01:19:39.992
- Yeah.
- And those kids don't have much time left.


953
01:19:41.287 --> 01:19:42.288
Harry.

954
01:19:42.955 --> 01:19:44.332
We do nothing,

955
01:19:44.415 --> 01:19:45.975
we'll be bringin' 'em
out dead for sure.


956
01:19:47.835 --> 01:19:49.595
But if they die
while we're bringin' 'em out,


957
01:19:50.546 --> 01:19:51.964
at least we will have tried.

958
01:20:07.396 --> 01:20:08.396
Sedated?

959
01:20:09.524 --> 01:20:10.650
How sedated?

960
01:20:14.362 --> 01:20:17.198
Fully. Fully unconscious.

961
01:20:17.281 --> 01:20:19.242
It's the only way
we can dive them out.


962
01:20:19.325 --> 01:20:20.493
Mmm.

963
01:20:20.576 --> 01:20:22.161
They have to be inert.

964
01:20:22.245 --> 01:20:23.704
Completely still.

965
01:20:23.788 --> 01:20:26.415
We'll take them out
like packages.


966
01:20:28.584 --> 01:20:31.045
And you are an anesthetist?

967
01:20:31.837 --> 01:20:33.631
Yes. Yes, I am.

968
01:20:34.966 --> 01:20:35.800
Preeya.

969
01:20:36.801 --> 01:20:37.927
Don't write this down.

970
01:20:39.428 --> 01:20:41.389
How safe is this procedure?

971
01:20:48.354 --> 01:20:51.190
I just can't answer that.

972
01:20:51.274 --> 01:20:52.650
Because I've never
done it before.


973
01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:56.654
As far as I know,
nobody ever has.


974
01:20:59.574 --> 01:21:00.575
In...

975
01:21:02.118 --> 01:21:04.620
In theory, it could work.

976
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.460
But we're talking about
administering anesthetics


977
01:21:11.544 --> 01:21:15.256
under conditions where we just
can't monitor the effect.


978
01:21:16.924 --> 01:21:19.844
So, too much

979
01:21:19.927 --> 01:21:21.971
and respiration
can just shut down.


980
01:21:23.264 --> 01:21:25.725
And too little and, uh...

981
01:21:27.852 --> 01:21:29.687
If they wake up under water,

982
01:21:31.856 --> 01:21:33.399
they can drown.

983
01:21:38.279 --> 01:21:41.616
So, you are expecting,
uh, casualties?


984
01:21:42.325 --> 01:21:44.869
Yes. I expect casualties.

985
01:21:46.704 --> 01:21:48.704
Minister, here!

986
01:21:50.041 --> 01:21:51.041
Governor!

987
01:21:52.627 --> 01:21:54.420
The minister is coming.

988
01:21:57.131 --> 01:21:59.091
Governor,
over here! Sir!


989
01:22:10.311 --> 01:22:13.689
The operation may now proceed.

990
01:22:17.902 --> 01:22:19.070
Yes, Minister.

991
01:22:26.911 --> 01:22:28.704
May you be successful.

992
01:22:37.672 --> 01:22:40.591
No one must know about the...

993
01:22:41.884 --> 01:22:43.344
the method you propose.

994
01:22:44.762 --> 01:22:46.597
Not even the parents.

995
01:22:49.684 --> 01:22:50.685
Do your best.

996
01:22:52.228 --> 01:22:53.354
And if we fail,

997
01:22:55.022 --> 01:22:57.775
the failure is mine alone.

998
01:23:02.947 --> 01:23:03.947
Okay.

999
01:23:13.249 --> 01:23:16.961
Your volunteering
and effort is critical.


1000
01:23:17.044 --> 01:23:20.673
The faster the waterways can be diverted
before the monsoons return,


1001
01:23:20.756 --> 01:23:23.175
the more time
we can buy for the boys.


1002
01:23:23.259 --> 01:23:26.137
They're telling us
the dams are helping.


1003
01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:28.723
It makes it possible for the
divers to reach the boys.


1004
01:23:28.806 --> 01:23:30.933
But if we don't build enough,

1005
01:23:31.016 --> 01:23:34.311
when the monsoons arrive,
the boys will drown.


1006
01:23:38.607 --> 01:23:40.377
<i>...not
involved in the operation,</i>


1007
01:23:40.401 --> 01:23:42.528
<i>please kindly leave
the basecamp area.</i>


1008
01:23:50.286 --> 01:23:52.037
<i>Attention, please.</i>

1009
01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:54.790
<i>All media and those
not involved in the operation,</i>


1010
01:23:54.874 --> 01:23:56.792
<i>please leave
the basecamp area.</i>


1011
01:23:58.627 --> 01:23:59.628
What's going on?

1012
01:24:00.755 --> 01:24:03.507
It's the TV guys,
the news guys,


1013
01:24:03.591 --> 01:24:05.134
they're all being sent away.

1014
01:24:06.218 --> 01:24:08.262
So they don't see
the bodies come out.


1015
01:24:16.771 --> 01:24:17.831
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1016
01:24:23.652 --> 01:24:24.921
Sorry, I don't understand.

1017
01:24:24.945 --> 01:24:26.489
For you, for the boys.

1018
01:24:26.572 --> 01:24:28.282
From Chai's mom, Buahom.

1019
01:24:29.658 --> 01:24:31.368
- Buahom?
- Yes, yes, yes.


1020
01:24:31.452 --> 01:24:32.661
Blessed by the holy man.

1021
01:24:33.496 --> 01:24:35.456
Okay. John.

1022
01:24:37.666 --> 01:24:38.793
Thank you.

1023
01:24:45.007 --> 01:24:46.087
Here. For good luck.

1024
01:24:46.675 --> 01:24:47.968
Don't believe in luck.

1025
01:24:48.052 --> 01:24:49.892
Just take it, take it.
She's watching, come on.


1026
01:24:59.897 --> 01:25:03.192
All right.
We'll be having to give them


1027
01:25:03.275 --> 01:25:06.278
repeat hits of ketamine
along the way.


1028
01:25:07.655 --> 01:25:08.655
We're givin' 'em ket?

1029
01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.240
Yeah.

1030
01:25:10.282 --> 01:25:13.911
Now, the injection goes
through the wet suit,


1031
01:25:13.994 --> 01:25:16.247
into the thigh muscle here
or here.


1032
01:25:17.456 --> 01:25:20.376
Each dose should last
about 30 minutes.


1033
01:25:20.459 --> 01:25:23.254
Keep a little bit of, see,
space on the needle there.


1034
01:25:23.337 --> 01:25:25.005
Push in and out.

1035
01:25:25.089 --> 01:25:26.590
It's quite simple.

1036
01:25:26.674 --> 01:25:28.384
But when they start waking,

1037
01:25:28.467 --> 01:25:31.428
you guys are gonna have to
top 'em up immediately. Yeah?


1038
01:25:31.512 --> 01:25:33.055
Boss.

1039
01:25:34.098 --> 01:25:35.599
Well done, Jas.

1040
01:25:35.683 --> 01:25:37.434
Just try again.

1041
01:25:50.072 --> 01:25:52.241
- Good luck.
- Hmm.


1042
01:25:52.324 --> 01:25:53.484
Good luck to us all, Captain.

1043
01:25:53.534 --> 01:25:54.785
- John.
- Captain.


1044
01:26:18.183 --> 01:26:21.812
I pray to the Guardian Spirit
of the forest


1045
01:26:23.856 --> 01:26:27.359
to apologize
for the thirteen boys.


1046
01:26:27.443 --> 01:26:29.695
If they have offended you,

1047
01:26:29.778 --> 01:26:32.781
intentionally
or unintentionally,


1048
01:26:34.408 --> 01:26:36.243
I apologize

1049
01:26:36.327 --> 01:26:39.538
to all spirits in the forest.

1050
01:26:40.748 --> 01:26:42.625
And spirits everywhere.

1051
01:26:44.043 --> 01:26:48.005
Everyone at the ceremony
would like to pray


1052
01:26:49.214 --> 01:26:52.259
for the thirteen young boys

1053
01:26:52.343 --> 01:26:55.304
to come back home safely.

1054
01:27:22.623 --> 01:27:24.833
It's Chamber 5, lads.

1055
01:27:24.917 --> 01:27:28.587
The SEALs ran electric cable.
Got some lights in here.


1056
01:27:28.671 --> 01:27:30.214
Roughly halfway.

1057
01:27:31.215 --> 01:27:32.758
These are spare tanks

1058
01:27:32.841 --> 01:27:34.343
the SEALs brought in
for the boys.


1059
01:27:34.426 --> 01:27:35.511
Copy.

1060
01:27:35.594 --> 01:27:37.721
Josh, you and Connor
wait for us here.


1061
01:27:37.805 --> 01:27:39.139
Right, mate, yeah.

1062
01:28:08.043 --> 01:28:10.295
All right, I stop here.

1063
01:28:11.922 --> 01:28:14.800
When the first boy
gets through the long dive,


1064
01:28:14.883 --> 01:28:16.427
I swim to you and report.

1065
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:17.761
'Cause if it's not
working out,


1066
01:28:17.845 --> 01:28:19.930
we need to know
before we bring any more out.


1067
01:28:20.014 --> 01:28:21.390
But if it is workin'...

1068
01:28:21.473 --> 01:28:22.793
- Then we get on with it.
- Right.


1069
01:28:23.267 --> 01:28:24.768
They're packages.

1070
01:28:24.852 --> 01:28:26.895
We're just the delivery guys.

1071
01:28:28.063 --> 01:28:29.690
Right.

1072
01:28:29.773 --> 01:28:32.651
Okay, lads. Let's do it.

1073
01:28:32.735 --> 01:28:34.069
Yep. Let's go.

1074
01:28:35.654 --> 01:28:36.739
Good luck.

1075
01:28:37.406 --> 01:28:38.406
Good luck, Harry.

1076
01:28:51.503 --> 01:28:52.503
This will sting a little.

1077
01:29:24.495 --> 01:29:26.121
Today's the day.

1078
01:29:26.205 --> 01:29:27.873
We're gonna start diving
the boys out.


1079
01:29:27.956 --> 01:29:29.374
We can take four.

1080
01:29:31.001 --> 01:29:33.063
They are taking us out today.
But they can only take four.


1081
01:29:34.004 --> 01:29:34.838
They're taking us out.

1082
01:29:47.309 --> 01:29:48.393
From your mom.

1083
01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:51.355
Blessed by Kruba.

1084
01:29:52.606 --> 01:29:53.966
- Doctor Karn.
- Yeah.


1085
01:29:54.024 --> 01:29:55.484
This is Doctor Harris.
Doctor Karn.


1086
01:29:55.567 --> 01:29:57.111
Hey.

1087
01:29:57.194 --> 01:29:58.874
- Doctor Harry.
- Doctor Karn.


1088
01:29:59.446 --> 01:30:01.448
Doctor, um,

1089
01:30:01.532 --> 01:30:05.661
you need to know
what we're proposing here.


1090
01:30:05.744 --> 01:30:07.579
That's for you.

1091
01:30:25.264 --> 01:30:27.057
So, who's going first?

1092
01:30:30.602 --> 01:30:31.602
Chai,

1093
01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:33.313
Arm,

1094
01:30:33.397 --> 01:30:34.397
Aat,

1095
01:30:34.565 --> 01:30:35.399
Poom.

1096
01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.609
Chai, you go first.

1097
01:30:42.489 --> 01:30:44.366
Guess I am first.

1098
01:30:50.372 --> 01:30:51.623
All right, chin in.

1099
01:30:55.043 --> 01:30:57.796
- Uh... No way. No.
- No?


1100
01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:00.215
No way, it's not gonna seal.

1101
01:31:00.299 --> 01:31:01.568
We'll get you
a better mask.


1102
01:31:02.676 --> 01:31:05.012
They have to find a mask
to fit you.


1103
01:31:06.597 --> 01:31:07.597
Today?

1104
01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:09.183
Probably tomorrow.

1105
01:31:09.266 --> 01:31:11.035
It's gonna be
okay. It's gonna be okay.


1106
01:31:11.059 --> 01:31:12.060
I promise.

1107
01:31:12.895 --> 01:31:13.979
Good lad.

1108
01:31:14.062 --> 01:31:16.315
Decha, you go.

1109
01:31:19.026 --> 01:31:20.402
Ready to go.

1110
01:31:27.951 --> 01:31:28.951
Open your mouth, Decha.

1111
01:31:50.933 --> 01:31:51.975
Arms up.

1112
01:32:04.363 --> 01:32:05.465
Turn about.

1113
01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:10.369
You'll be home soon.

1114
01:32:12.079 --> 01:32:13.997
He's tying Decha's hands.

1115
01:32:23.465 --> 01:32:25.300
It will be okay.

1116
01:32:25.384 --> 01:32:27.261
Don't let the boys watch.

1117
01:32:27.344 --> 01:32:28.947
There's no need to scare them
with needles.


1118
01:32:28.971 --> 01:32:30.931
Step in front. Good lad.

1119
01:32:32.474 --> 01:32:34.726
Move back, turn around.

1120
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:38.063
A-ha.

1121
01:32:38.146 --> 01:32:40.274
The lucky first customer.

1122
01:32:40.691 --> 01:32:42.067
Come on.

1123
01:32:42.150 --> 01:32:43.694
Yep. Steady as you go.

1124
01:32:43.777 --> 01:32:44.861
Here we go.

1125
01:32:44.945 --> 01:32:46.822
Come into my comfy office.

1126
01:32:46.905 --> 01:32:49.283
Now, I'm Harry.

1127
01:32:49.366 --> 01:32:51.952
And you're a very brave boy,
you're number one.


1128
01:32:52.035 --> 01:32:54.246
And you're lucky,
'cause you get Jason.


1129
01:32:54.329 --> 01:32:58.709
He is the number one diver
in all the world.


1130
01:33:00.377 --> 01:33:01.777
Have you been missing
the World Cup?


1131
01:33:03.130 --> 01:33:04.756
Huh? Well, guess what?

1132
01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.342
Brazil got knocked out, huh?

1133
01:33:07.426 --> 01:33:08.778
You would've seen
one of these before.


1134
01:33:08.802 --> 01:33:10.679
That was a shock, wasn't it?

1135
01:33:10.762 --> 01:33:12.639
Brazil, huh?

1136
01:33:12.723 --> 01:33:13.763
Guess who knocked 'em out?

1137
01:33:14.308 --> 01:33:15.350
Belgium.

1138
01:33:18.562 --> 01:33:20.897
Bet they're really upset
about that.


1139
01:33:20.981 --> 01:33:21.981
Belgium.

1140
01:33:22.983 --> 01:33:24.359
Get you out of here so that

1141
01:33:25.569 --> 01:33:27.738
you can watch
the rest of the games, huh?


1142
01:33:28.989 --> 01:33:32.576
Mmm. Tough guy, huh?

1143
01:33:32.659 --> 01:33:33.910
Didn't even feel that one.

1144
01:33:34.786 --> 01:33:35.787
Mmm.

1145
01:33:37.205 --> 01:33:39.166
Easy, huh? Easy.

1146
01:33:40.917 --> 01:33:42.377
Look away.

1147
01:33:47.299 --> 01:33:48.699
Good on the chin.

1148
01:33:49.301 --> 01:33:50.320
All right,
you wanna take him?


1149
01:33:50.344 --> 01:33:51.470
Yeah, good, good.

1150
01:33:53.805 --> 01:33:55.325
All right, good,
bring him back.


1151
01:33:58.643 --> 01:34:00.395
Okay, his head back.

1152
01:34:01.646 --> 01:34:02.689
Most certainly.

1153
01:34:02.773 --> 01:34:03.933
- Good.
- Yeah.


1154
01:34:06.902 --> 01:34:08.362
- Slow.
- Good.


1155
01:34:13.575 --> 01:34:15.369
Let's pull that back.

1156
01:34:15.452 --> 01:34:16.932
All right,
check for breathing.


1157
01:34:16.995 --> 01:34:17.996
All right.

1158
01:34:36.848 --> 01:34:37.848
Looks good.

1159
01:34:38.517 --> 01:34:39.601
Feet.

1160
01:34:54.032 --> 01:34:55.534
Okay.

1161
01:34:55.867 --> 01:34:57.035
Okay.

1162
01:36:07.647 --> 01:36:09.127
He's been
breathing just fine.


1163
01:36:10.108 --> 01:36:11.610
Fucking brilliant.

1164
01:36:14.404 --> 01:36:15.989
You didn't think
it would work?


1165
01:36:20.410 --> 01:36:21.495
Me neither.

1166
01:36:24.372 --> 01:36:27.250
All right. I'm off.

1167
01:36:27.334 --> 01:36:28.502
Good luck.

1168
01:36:31.546 --> 01:36:33.426
And look,
you're lucky because see this?


1169
01:36:33.507 --> 01:36:34.841
That's John.

1170
01:36:34.925 --> 01:36:36.092
He's diving you out

1171
01:36:36.176 --> 01:36:39.387
and he is the number one diver

1172
01:36:40.347 --> 01:36:41.765
in the whole world.

1173
01:36:41.848 --> 01:36:43.558
And I know
it's been pretty exciting


1174
01:36:43.642 --> 01:36:45.352
for you in here,
but guess what?


1175
01:36:45.435 --> 01:36:46.579
Bit of excitement
in the World Cup.


1176
01:36:46.603 --> 01:36:49.773
Belgium knocked out Brazil.

1177
01:36:49.856 --> 01:36:52.150
Harry, Harry.
Did you give him the shot?


1178
01:36:52.567 --> 01:36:54.152
Oh, shit.

1179
01:36:54.236 --> 01:36:55.421
We were supposed to wait
till we heard


1180
01:36:55.445 --> 01:36:56.947
Jason made it out okay.

1181
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:59.491
Yeah. I've done the atropine,
and I'm gonna have to...


1182
01:36:59.574 --> 01:37:00.742
I'm gonna have to keep going.

1183
01:37:00.825 --> 01:37:03.578
No panic. No panic.
Yeah.


1184
01:37:03.662 --> 01:37:04.496
Yeah, carry on.

1185
01:37:04.579 --> 01:37:05.664
We gotta get on with it.

1186
01:37:05.747 --> 01:37:06.849
I don't wanna risk
my boy waking up.


1187
01:37:08.416 --> 01:37:10.919
Not so bad, huh?

1188
01:37:11.002 --> 01:37:13.338
- Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.


1189
01:37:23.056 --> 01:37:24.056
Good.

1190
01:37:25.016 --> 01:37:27.769
Kiet, you know my lad's name?

1191
01:37:27.852 --> 01:37:29.145
- Arm.
- Arm?


1192
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:30.605
He's the team captain.

1193
01:37:33.567 --> 01:37:34.609
Okay.

1194
01:37:47.414 --> 01:37:48.832
It's working.

1195
01:39:03.448 --> 01:39:04.866
Oh, jeez.

1196
01:39:39.317 --> 01:39:40.902
Yeah, he's good.

1197
01:39:49.244 --> 01:39:50.286
See you out there.

1198
01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:51.530
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1199
01:39:53.581 --> 01:39:54.958
Good luck, Chris.

1200
01:40:09.472 --> 01:40:11.352
- Jason okay?
- Jason's through.


1201
01:40:11.391 --> 01:40:12.391
Good.

1202
01:40:12.434 --> 01:40:13.536
- Careful.
- Okay.


1203
01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:14.561
Yeah, easy, easy.

1204
01:40:14.644 --> 01:40:15.687
- Slow, slow, slow.
- Okay.


1205
01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:16.997
- Slowly, slowly.
- New cylinder.


1206
01:40:17.021 --> 01:40:18.101
I'll give him another dose.

1207
01:40:20.483 --> 01:40:22.527
Okay,
so I've got him. Okay.


1208
01:40:22.610 --> 01:40:23.629
- Coming off.
- Okay.


1209
01:40:23.653 --> 01:40:24.654
He all right?

1210
01:40:25.488 --> 01:40:26.781
Nice. Boy's good.

1211
01:40:26.865 --> 01:40:28.575
All right,
let's bring him over.


1212
01:40:28.658 --> 01:40:30.660
All right. Step.

1213
01:40:30.744 --> 01:40:31.911
- Thanks.
- Yeah.


1214
01:40:33.371 --> 01:40:34.873
- Careful.
- Yep.


1215
01:40:34.956 --> 01:40:35.996
Turning him around.

1216
01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:46.885
Okay.

1217
01:40:48.094 --> 01:40:49.137
There we go.

1218
01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:51.431
One, two, three.
Turn him over.


1219
01:41:00.231 --> 01:41:01.649
No, he's not breathing.

1220
01:41:08.364 --> 01:41:09.532
No, he's okay.

1221
01:41:09.616 --> 01:41:11.284
He's okay. He's breathing.

1222
01:41:11.367 --> 01:41:12.367
Okay.

1223
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:14.204
Yeah. Again.

1224
01:41:14.287 --> 01:41:15.830
- Yep.
- Yeah. Slowly.


1225
01:41:24.881 --> 01:41:26.966
Fuck! He's not breathing.

1226
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:28.051
No. Mask off.

1227
01:41:29.052 --> 01:41:30.970
- Mask off.
- Easy.


1228
01:41:31.054 --> 01:41:33.014
- Here we go.
- Easy, easy.


1229
01:41:33.097 --> 01:41:35.517
Okay.
Right, that's it. Mask off.


1230
01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.852
Okay. Gettin' there.

1231
01:41:37.936 --> 01:41:40.688
Okay, let me in.
Okay...


1232
01:41:50.156 --> 01:41:51.156
Breathe.

1233
01:41:51.741 --> 01:41:52.867
Breathe.

1234
01:41:56.496 --> 01:41:57.497
Okay, he's breathing.

1235
01:41:58.998 --> 01:42:00.875
Every time I put him
under the water, he stops.


1236
01:42:00.959 --> 01:42:02.001
You all right?

1237
01:42:02.085 --> 01:42:03.670
Yep. Okay.

1238
01:42:04.838 --> 01:42:05.964
Mask on.

1239
01:42:06.047 --> 01:42:07.047
Okay.

1240
01:42:11.261 --> 01:42:12.262
All right. Steady.

1241
01:42:14.472 --> 01:42:16.641
Good work, Josh.

1242
01:42:16.724 --> 01:42:18.564
- Okay.
- Good luck.


1243
01:42:21.771 --> 01:42:23.189
John, you okay?

1244
01:42:23.273 --> 01:42:25.817
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just give me a minute, please.


1245
01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.318
Is he all right?

1246
01:42:27.402 --> 01:42:29.070
He's all right.

1247
01:42:29.153 --> 01:42:31.823
Hey, is he, uh,
still breathing okay?


1248
01:42:31.906 --> 01:42:33.658
Yeah. Yeah.

1249
01:42:35.285 --> 01:42:36.327
Okay.

1250
01:42:37.579 --> 01:42:38.913
Yeah, bring him over.

1251
01:42:41.958 --> 01:42:43.418
Okay.

1252
01:42:43.501 --> 01:42:45.461
Okay, Arm. Gentle.

1253
01:42:56.723 --> 01:42:58.349
Yeah, he's good.

1254
01:43:00.393 --> 01:43:01.394
All right.

1255
01:43:03.187 --> 01:43:05.106
- Thanks, boys.
- Cheers.


1256
01:43:16.409 --> 01:43:17.553
Okay,
let's go, let's go!


1257
01:43:20.705 --> 01:43:21.789
Watch the head!

1258
01:43:28.379 --> 01:43:29.815
Everybody,
get ready to take that.


1259
01:43:29.839 --> 01:43:31.090
One, two, three.

1260
01:43:31.174 --> 01:43:32.216
Faster, faster.

1261
01:43:36.471 --> 01:43:38.848
Gently.

1262
01:43:42.435 --> 01:43:44.604
How is he?

1263
01:43:44.687 --> 01:43:46.439
He's still breathing.

1264
01:43:51.611 --> 01:43:53.237
Careful with his head.

1265
01:43:55.573 --> 01:43:57.367
Oxygen coming.

1266
01:43:57.450 --> 01:43:58.761
Make sure you're ready.

1267
01:43:58.785 --> 01:44:00.036
Got shallow breaths.

1268
01:44:00.995 --> 01:44:02.288
Okay!

1269
01:44:02.372 --> 01:44:03.474
Let's go, let's go!

1270
01:44:04.415 --> 01:44:05.708
Vital signs are stable.

1271
01:44:05.792 --> 01:44:07.853
Okay,
nice and easy, nice and easy.


1272
01:44:07.877 --> 01:44:08.878
Easy, guys.

1273
01:44:13.216 --> 01:44:14.776
Nice and easy,
nice and easy.


1274
01:44:16.177 --> 01:44:17.345
Get him out, get him out.

1275
01:45:22.035 --> 01:45:23.119
A boy is coming out!

1276
01:45:32.211 --> 01:45:33.647
The Governor asked me
to tell everyone


1277
01:45:33.671 --> 01:45:35.423
the rescue
is going well so far.


1278
01:45:35.506 --> 01:45:37.175
Why can't we have names?

1279
01:45:39.135 --> 01:45:41.429
I'm afraid
we can't release any details.


1280
01:45:43.681 --> 01:45:46.309
I know how hard it must
be for all of you


1281
01:45:46.392 --> 01:45:49.479
but when the operation is complete,
you'll be the first to know.


1282
01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:52.315
Why does it have to be
a secret?


1283
01:46:45.785 --> 01:46:46.786
Okay.

1284
01:46:46.869 --> 01:46:48.013
Ready, we're ready.

1285
01:46:49.664 --> 01:46:50.998
Yeah, he's okay. He's okay.

1286
01:46:52.333 --> 01:46:53.167
Good.

1287
01:46:54.168 --> 01:46:55.294
Careful.

1288
01:48:05.823 --> 01:48:07.491
- John.
- Jason.


1289
01:48:13.497 --> 01:48:14.790
You okay?

1290
01:48:14.874 --> 01:48:15.917
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1291
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.668
That was, uh...

1292
01:48:17.752 --> 01:48:19.253
It's tough.

1293
01:48:23.758 --> 01:48:24.758
Hey, John.

1294
01:48:26.302 --> 01:48:28.054
- John?
- Yeah?


1295
01:48:28.137 --> 01:48:30.973
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.


1296
01:48:31.057 --> 01:48:34.602
It's just, uh,
my lad was called Arm...


1297
01:48:34.685 --> 01:48:36.245
Well, he stopped breathing
for a minute.


1298
01:48:37.271 --> 01:48:39.148
I thought he...
I thought he was...


1299
01:48:40.524 --> 01:48:42.777
But he's not. He's okay.
He's okay.


1300
01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:44.695
Well done, Chris.
It's not easy.


1301
01:48:45.488 --> 01:48:46.948
Thanks, John. Thanks.

1302
01:49:11.555 --> 01:49:13.099
Medic. Medic?

1303
01:49:15.184 --> 01:49:16.536
Um, what happened?

1304
01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.479
It was four out of four,
Doctor.


1305
01:49:18.562 --> 01:49:20.022
Four what?

1306
01:49:20.106 --> 01:49:21.524
All the boys are fine.

1307
01:49:23.818 --> 01:49:24.818
Great job.

1308
01:49:25.778 --> 01:49:26.779
Yeah.

1309
01:50:00.438 --> 01:50:01.581
<i>We understand</i>

1310
01:50:01.605 --> 01:50:03.107
<i>that a team of elite divers</i>

1311
01:50:03.190 --> 01:50:04.734
<i>is attempting
to guide the boys</i>


1312
01:50:04.817 --> 01:50:07.486
<i>through a three-kilometer
underwater swim to safety.</i>


1313
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:09.155
"Swim to safety."

1314
01:50:09.238 --> 01:50:10.573
I like that.

1315
01:50:14.327 --> 01:50:16.620
Got any custard creams left?

1316
01:50:16.704 --> 01:50:17.997
No.

1317
01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:19.373
What do you have?

1318
01:50:19.457 --> 01:50:20.708
I ate them all.

1319
01:50:20.791 --> 01:50:21.959
- Knob.
<i>- The media</i>


1320
01:50:22.043 --> 01:50:24.086
<i>were relocated
to clear additional space</i>


1321
01:50:24.170 --> 01:50:27.214
<i>for essential military
and volunteer personnel.</i>


1322
01:50:27.298 --> 01:50:29.675
<i>The rescue operation
is shrouded in secrecy...</i>


1323
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:34.555
Yesterday, they said
if we got one boy out alive,


1324
01:50:34.638 --> 01:50:35.973
we'd be heroes.

1325
01:50:39.602 --> 01:50:41.520
Now, we bring
a single one out dead...


1326
01:50:46.901 --> 01:50:47.902
Yeah.

1327
01:50:59.121 --> 01:51:02.333
The air tanks are all
strategically placed along the route.


1328
01:51:02.416 --> 01:51:07.046
During yesterday's rescue,
they used every single tank.


1329
01:51:10.007 --> 01:51:11.634
The Governor
of Chiang Rai Province


1330
01:51:11.717 --> 01:51:13.803
called this,
"A War With Water."


1331
01:51:13.886 --> 01:51:17.848
Local forecasting
is predicting heavy rain.


1332
01:51:17.932 --> 01:51:19.618
No need to be scared, Rit.

1333
01:51:19.642 --> 01:51:20.726
You know why?

1334
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:22.978
Because you have
the best diver.


1335
01:51:23.062 --> 01:51:24.188
Ready? Look up.

1336
01:51:26.107 --> 01:51:27.858
Good boy.

1337
01:51:27.942 --> 01:51:29.193
See? All over.

1338
01:51:29.276 --> 01:51:30.653
All over.

1339
01:51:30.736 --> 01:51:32.446
There you go. Good boy.

1340
01:51:35.282 --> 01:51:36.784
I am Dew.

1341
01:51:36.867 --> 01:51:38.119
I'm Rick.

1342
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:06.230
Bring down more pipe!

1343
01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:09.108
There's no more!

1344
01:52:10.109 --> 01:52:11.269
Is that the last of the pipe?

1345
01:52:11.318 --> 01:52:12.653
We've sent for more
from Bangkok.


1346
01:52:13.988 --> 01:52:15.030
Need more pipe?

1347
01:52:29.086 --> 01:52:30.296
Pipe.

1348
01:52:59.116 --> 01:53:00.385
Yeah, they're good.

1349
01:53:00.409 --> 01:53:02.077
- Okay.
- Sixth is on the Skedco.


1350
01:53:04.747 --> 01:53:08.918
We're hearing that five boys
have been brought out of the cave today.


1351
01:53:09.001 --> 01:53:13.714
Recent weather reports show
storm clouds on the horizon.


1352
01:53:16.008 --> 01:53:19.720
The monsoon season
is closing in fast.


1353
01:53:29.939 --> 01:53:31.299
Hell yeah, man!

1354
01:53:31.357 --> 01:53:32.942
Yeah!

1355
01:53:49.291 --> 01:53:50.918
Mask for Chai.

1356
01:53:51.001 --> 01:53:52.795
Flown in from Bangkok.

1357
01:53:52.878 --> 01:53:53.878
All right.

1358
01:53:55.047 --> 01:53:56.047
Nah.

1359
01:53:57.591 --> 01:53:58.676
Ah!

1360
01:54:03.264 --> 01:54:05.140
Think it'll fit?

1361
01:54:05.224 --> 01:54:06.767
Yeah, it better do.
It is smaller.


1362
01:54:07.434 --> 01:54:08.434
Have a seat, Bas.

1363
01:54:09.270 --> 01:54:10.813
Thank you.

1364
01:55:04.491 --> 01:55:05.552
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?


1365
01:55:05.576 --> 01:55:06.896
You wanna
keep it like that, okay?


1366
01:55:14.293 --> 01:55:16.295
That's a lot of water.

1367
01:55:46.533 --> 01:55:48.243
Water level's
gonna be rising in there.


1368
01:55:48.327 --> 01:55:49.870
For sure.

1369
01:55:49.953 --> 01:55:51.139
We'll still make it through,
though, right?


1370
01:55:51.163 --> 01:55:52.498
Don't know.

1371
01:55:52.581 --> 01:55:54.792
We dive and we find out.

1372
01:55:54.875 --> 01:55:56.627
It depends, Jason.

1373
01:55:56.710 --> 01:55:58.688
Rick and I have been in there
when it's fully flooded.


1374
01:55:58.712 --> 01:56:00.214
It's a beast.

1375
01:56:00.297 --> 01:56:03.509
Come on.
We're not stopping now.


1376
01:56:03.592 --> 01:56:06.261
You die in a cave
if you want to, Jason.


1377
01:56:06.345 --> 01:56:08.681
If I'm not sure of coming out,
I'm not going in.


1378
01:56:27.199 --> 01:56:28.117
Hurry.

1379
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.703
It won't stop raining.
We need more sandbags.


1380
01:56:30.786 --> 01:56:34.415
Everyone, there are three sinkholes
in the rocks to the east.


1381
01:57:20.002 --> 01:57:22.713
Okay. We can make it.

1382
01:57:22.796 --> 01:57:24.840
- We better move fast.
- Okay, lads.


1383
01:57:28.635 --> 01:57:29.803
All right, Harry.

1384
01:57:48.447 --> 01:57:49.591
Everyone leaves today.

1385
01:57:49.615 --> 01:57:51.015
We do this
as fast as we can.


1386
01:57:52.659 --> 01:57:53.660
All right.

1387
01:57:57.247 --> 01:58:00.417
No, see, that's open.
It's not gonna seal.


1388
01:58:00.501 --> 01:58:02.544
Yeah. It's buckling.

1389
01:58:02.628 --> 01:58:04.630
All right,
let's dive the others out.


1390
01:58:04.713 --> 01:58:06.590
Then we'll get him sorted.
Yeah?


1391
01:58:06.673 --> 01:58:10.010
Okay, I got this.
It's pink. I like it.


1392
01:58:10.093 --> 01:58:12.221
All right,
so, who's next?


1393
01:58:13.222 --> 01:58:14.348
I can't swim.

1394
01:58:15.015 --> 01:58:16.934
Will we survive?

1395
01:58:17.017 --> 01:58:19.895
Don't be afraid.
We have to trust them.


1396
01:58:23.232 --> 01:58:24.274
Okay.

1397
01:58:27.486 --> 01:58:28.654
Okay, turn around.

1398
01:58:32.783 --> 01:58:33.992
Who have we got here?

1399
01:58:34.076 --> 01:58:35.661
- This is Prem.
- Prem.


1400
01:58:35.744 --> 01:58:37.347
Come on down, Prem.
Let's get you outta here.


1401
01:58:38.372 --> 01:58:40.541
Are we the last to go?

1402
01:58:40.624 --> 01:58:42.000
Mmm.

1403
01:58:42.084 --> 01:58:43.311
Chris is diving you out.

1404
01:58:43.335 --> 01:58:45.003
You know, Chris, see,

1405
01:58:45.087 --> 01:58:48.382
he's the number one rescue
diver in the whole world.


1406
01:58:48.465 --> 01:58:49.633
That's me.

1407
01:58:49.716 --> 01:58:51.694
All right. Prem, you know
the drill. You've seen this.


1408
01:58:51.718 --> 01:58:53.303
Do you wanna look up? Ready?

1409
01:58:58.350 --> 01:59:01.436
All right. Yep.

1410
01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:02.729
Off you go.

1411
01:59:18.745 --> 01:59:20.372
All right. One more to go.

1412
01:59:21.874 --> 01:59:23.792
Your choice. Up or down?

1413
01:59:23.876 --> 01:59:25.961
Up.

1414
01:59:26.044 --> 01:59:28.046
There you go.
That was pretty painless.


1415
01:59:29.715 --> 01:59:32.092
We're gonna get you home.
Maybe for dinner.


1416
01:59:32.926 --> 01:59:33.927
Hmm?

1417
01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:37.681
Hmm.

1418
01:59:45.439 --> 01:59:46.679
It's the best
we can do.


1419
01:59:46.732 --> 01:59:48.775
If I pull it too tight,
it'll collapse the seal.


1420
01:59:48.859 --> 01:59:50.444
It's still a little loose.

1421
01:59:50.527 --> 01:59:52.279
We don't have time.
The water is rising.


1422
01:59:52.362 --> 01:59:54.242
If he doesn't come out now,
he doesn't come out.


1423
01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:57.701
I'll keep it from bumping.

1424
01:59:57.784 --> 01:59:58.952
I can hold it if I have to.

1425
02:00:03.123 --> 02:00:04.166
It's your call.

1426
02:00:04.833 --> 02:00:06.126
I'll be going slow.

1427
02:00:06.209 --> 02:00:07.794
So give me some space
before you follow.


1428
02:00:27.814 --> 02:00:29.358
The boys?

1429
02:00:29.441 --> 02:00:31.234
Are they out safely?

1430
02:00:32.027 --> 02:00:34.780
We hope so. Your turn now.

1431
02:01:03.308 --> 02:01:05.268
He's no heavier than the boys.

1432
02:01:07.437 --> 02:01:08.730
I'll be right behind you.

1433
02:01:08.814 --> 02:01:10.232
Not too close.

1434
02:01:11.650 --> 02:01:12.859
See you at the pub.

1435
02:02:29.311 --> 02:02:31.730
All right.
I guess it's our turn now.


1436
02:02:31.813 --> 02:02:33.774
You go. We follow.

1437
02:02:33.857 --> 02:02:36.068
Yeah. I mean, remember,

1438
02:02:36.151 --> 02:02:38.653
the current is much stronger
than it was.


1439
02:02:38.737 --> 02:02:41.031
- And the water is, you know.
- Yeah.


1440
02:02:42.449 --> 02:02:47.496
The clock is ticking,
putting pressure on the rescue team.


1441
02:02:47.579 --> 02:02:52.501
The fear is the heavy downpour
will push water back into the cave


1442
02:02:52.584 --> 02:02:58.256
faster than the volunteers
can divert the rain from the mountain.


1443
02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.480
Yes, one more, one more.

1444
02:03:15.357 --> 02:03:16.858
Hello?

1445
02:03:16.942 --> 02:03:18.026
Hello, hello, hello!

1446
02:03:19.402 --> 02:03:21.363
Okay. Okay.

1447
02:03:21.446 --> 02:03:23.073
Okay. Okay.

1448
02:03:41.091 --> 02:03:43.093
Yeah, come on.
Keep his head up.


1449
02:03:43.176 --> 02:03:45.011
Start cutting
through the next one.


1450
02:03:45.679 --> 02:03:46.805
Reset for 11.

1451
02:04:22.007 --> 02:04:23.425
Okay, Jason.

1452
02:04:23.508 --> 02:04:25.427
I've got him.

1453
02:04:38.023 --> 02:04:39.858
Okay? Three, two...

1454
02:04:40.859 --> 02:04:43.236
He's good. He's good.

1455
02:04:48.325 --> 02:04:49.685
Steady now, lads.

1456
02:04:53.163 --> 02:04:54.203
We got a visual.

1457
02:05:16.603 --> 02:05:17.603
Chris.

1458
02:05:18.563 --> 02:05:19.563
Rick.

1459
02:05:21.942 --> 02:05:23.652
It's really good to see you.

1460
02:05:23.735 --> 02:05:25.820
I didn't know if anyone
was gonna be able to...


1461
02:05:25.904 --> 02:05:27.614
Is he alive?

1462
02:05:27.697 --> 02:05:29.032
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah?


1463
02:05:29.115 --> 02:05:30.909
No, yeah, he is, yeah. I...

1464
02:05:30.992 --> 02:05:32.786
I lost the line back there.

1465
02:05:32.869 --> 02:05:34.955
I found a power cable
and followed it here.


1466
02:05:35.789 --> 02:05:37.374
I, uh...

1467
02:05:37.457 --> 02:05:38.583
I don't know where I am.

1468
02:05:38.667 --> 02:05:40.085
You're still
in Chamber 4.


1469
02:05:40.168 --> 02:05:41.211
Well done.

1470
02:05:44.089 --> 02:05:45.173
Keep him topped up.

1471
02:05:46.132 --> 02:05:47.425
You'll be fine.

1472
02:05:47.509 --> 02:05:49.928
Wait for Harry.
He's coming now.


1473
02:05:50.011 --> 02:05:51.304
Let him have a look, yeah?

1474
02:05:51.388 --> 02:05:53.056
Yeah. Yeah.

1475
02:05:53.139 --> 02:05:55.392
Your only duty is to that boy.

1476
02:05:55.475 --> 02:05:56.726
We'll get you out.

1477
02:05:58.603 --> 02:05:59.813
So get ready.

1478
02:05:59.896 --> 02:06:01.481
Yeah. Okay.

1479
02:06:01.564 --> 02:06:03.275
Put his mask on

1480
02:06:03.358 --> 02:06:06.361
and do whatever Harry says
is best. Got it?


1481
02:06:08.697 --> 02:06:10.532
See you on the other side.

1482
02:06:47.193 --> 02:06:48.486
Where's Chris?

1483
02:06:48.570 --> 02:06:50.864
- Still in Chamber 4.
- Okay.


1484
02:06:50.947 --> 02:06:52.615
- Coach is breathing.
- Okay.


1485
02:06:55.744 --> 02:06:56.971
Hey, hey, hey.
Mister John.


1486
02:06:56.995 --> 02:06:58.723
- He's fine, he's fine.
- Okay.


1487
02:06:58.747 --> 02:07:00.373
Easy with him.

1488
02:07:01.458 --> 02:07:03.168
Coach looks good.

1489
02:07:07.005 --> 02:07:08.381
How's Chris gettin' on?

1490
02:07:10.675 --> 02:07:11.968
He's struggling a bit.

1491
02:07:16.431 --> 02:07:17.766
Told him to wait for Harry.

1492
02:07:35.075 --> 02:07:36.201
Chris?

1493
02:07:36.785 --> 02:07:37.785
Yeah.

1494
02:07:37.827 --> 02:07:39.204
What's happened?

1495
02:07:39.287 --> 02:07:42.707
I, uh... I lost the line.

1496
02:07:42.791 --> 02:07:44.000
Is your boy okay?

1497
02:07:44.084 --> 02:07:45.251
I think so.

1498
02:07:45.335 --> 02:07:47.921
You, uh,
might wanna check him.


1499
02:07:48.004 --> 02:07:49.422
Did you give him a top-off?

1500
02:07:49.506 --> 02:07:51.386
Yeah, I gave him one
about an hour ago, I think.


1501
02:07:52.717 --> 02:07:54.177
Yeah, let's give him
another hit.


1502
02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:55.303
Okay.

1503
02:07:58.223 --> 02:08:01.184
Do you want me to maybe
take over from here?


1504
02:08:01.851 --> 02:08:04.270
Uh... No, no, no.

1505
02:08:04.354 --> 02:08:05.605
I should... I should do it.

1506
02:08:08.024 --> 02:08:09.024
It's the U-bend.

1507
02:08:09.776 --> 02:08:10.777
Um...

1508
02:08:11.736 --> 02:08:13.488
Well, I mean, Rick said, uh...

1509
02:08:14.906 --> 02:08:17.951
I mean, he just... He said to
just do what you said, so...


1510
02:08:18.034 --> 02:08:19.619
Uh...

1511
02:08:19.702 --> 02:08:23.206
Well, I reckon you've done
the hardest part.


1512
02:08:24.374 --> 02:08:25.625
Why don't I do the last bit?

1513
02:08:25.708 --> 02:08:28.670
And that way I could say
that I was a rescuer, too.


1514
02:08:30.296 --> 02:08:32.590
I mean, Rick just said to do
what's best for the boy.


1515
02:08:33.967 --> 02:08:36.594
I really think
that that's what's best.


1516
02:08:39.264 --> 02:08:40.932
- Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.


1517
02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:11.880
The pump is going!

1518
02:09:13.298 --> 02:09:14.378
The pump's gone!

1519
02:09:16.009 --> 02:09:17.469
Come on, Chris. Come on.

1520
02:09:20.805 --> 02:09:21.805
Harry!

1521
02:09:23.099 --> 02:09:24.893
Is the boy good?

1522
02:09:24.976 --> 02:09:26.269
Yeah, he's fine.

1523
02:09:26.352 --> 02:09:27.687
How about Chris?

1524
02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:29.105
He's right behind me.

1525
02:09:33.318 --> 02:09:35.737
Rick. Rick!

1526
02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:38.531
I'm gonna get my cylinders.
I'll go back for him.


1527
02:09:38.615 --> 02:09:39.657
He'll be here.

1528
02:09:52.795 --> 02:09:54.547
Nice one, Chris!

1529
02:09:57.550 --> 02:09:58.927
- Well done.
- Thanks.


1530
02:09:59.010 --> 02:10:00.720
- My boy, is he...
- He's alive.


1531
02:10:02.597 --> 02:10:04.682
We bloody did it, lads!

1532
02:10:07.393 --> 02:10:09.562
- Chris, okay?
- Yeah.


1533
02:10:12.190 --> 02:10:13.775
Not all out yet.

1534
02:10:46.849 --> 02:10:48.226
Everyone out!

1535
02:10:49.561 --> 02:10:51.020
The pumps are exploding!

1536
02:11:00.405 --> 02:11:01.739
Hey, hey, hey!

1537
02:11:10.873 --> 02:11:12.625
Pichai.

1538
02:11:16.045 --> 02:11:17.338
Okay.

1539
02:11:22.594 --> 02:11:24.554
Oh.

1540
02:11:24.637 --> 02:11:26.264
Good to see ya.

1541
02:11:39.944 --> 02:11:41.738
Okay.

1542
02:12:48.554 --> 02:12:49.874
Well done, boys.

1543
02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:53.726
Well done, old man.

1544
02:12:56.896 --> 02:12:58.481
Good job.

1545
02:12:58.564 --> 02:13:00.316
- Thank you, Rick.
- Thank you, Captain.


1546
02:13:01.734 --> 02:13:03.003
- Great work, Captain.

1547
02:13:03.027 --> 02:13:04.963
- Great job, guys.

- Thank you so much.

1550
02:13:07.824 --> 02:13:09.742
- Legend. Legend, mate.
- Well done, lads.


1551
02:13:51.784 --> 02:13:53.786
Guys, I'm sorry about the...

1552
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:55.204
The line. It just kept...

1553
02:13:57.623 --> 02:13:59.041
Hey, it's okay.

1554
02:14:00.084 --> 02:14:01.753
It's done.

1555
02:14:01.836 --> 02:14:03.921
- Yeah. It worked.
- It's okay, Chris.


1556
02:14:04.005 --> 02:14:07.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1557
02:14:07.216 --> 02:14:09.385
I just thought I was gonna
have to leave him in there.


1558
02:14:15.975 --> 02:14:18.269
You all have come from all over.

1559
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:21.606
From the nearby town.

1560
02:14:21.689 --> 02:14:24.192
Others, from different
countries around the world.


1561
02:14:25.651 --> 02:14:27.403
You have given your time.

1562
02:14:27.487 --> 02:14:28.613
Your expertise.

1563
02:14:29.614 --> 02:14:32.575
Some, even the rice crops.

1564
02:14:32.658 --> 02:14:34.076
Hello.

1565
02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:36.954
<i>And you ask
for nothing in return.</i>


1566
02:14:37.038 --> 02:14:39.415
<i>But I know
that you all did this</i>


1567
02:14:40.041 --> 02:14:41.292
for one reason.

1568
02:14:42.502 --> 02:14:44.212
The love for the boys.

1569
02:14:46.547 --> 02:14:48.174
It's okay.

1570
02:14:50.593 --> 02:14:51.803
We're okay.

1571
02:14:54.931 --> 02:14:55.932
It's good.

1572
02:14:57.225 --> 02:14:58.226
Thank you.

1573
02:15:00.895 --> 02:15:02.695
Thank you very much, guys.

1574
02:15:06.275 --> 02:15:08.115
Governor,

02:15:22.583 --> 02:15:23.835
Okay.

1577
02:15:23.918 --> 02:15:25.628
Oh, all right. Yeah.

Well, you did it, Harry.

That's everyone, sir.

1582
