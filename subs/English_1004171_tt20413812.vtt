00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:09.302
"Virginia Woolf / To the Lighthouse "

2
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.438
Aoi?

3
00:09:01.368 --> 00:09:03.370
Are you working late tonight?

4
00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:09.626
Hey, Miyabi?

5
00:09:11.544 --> 00:09:14.046
Oh. I'm sorry, what?

6
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.537
You gonna be late tonight?

7
00:09:15.687 --> 00:09:16.383
Huh?

8
00:09:16.508 --> 00:09:17.509
At work.

9
00:09:18.551 --> 00:09:22.096
Um... yeah. A bit later than usual.

10
00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:24.307
Then I'll cook tonight.

11
00:09:24.807 --> 00:09:26.726
Alright. Thanks.

12
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.896
Oh, hey.

13
00:09:32.232 --> 00:09:36.569
I'm working on a new song
and playing it at the party.


14
00:09:36.653 --> 00:09:38.738
I want you to listen to it.

15
00:09:39.572 --> 00:09:41.408
OK. Sure.

16
00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:06.849
That thing you're wearing...

17
00:10:10.728 --> 00:10:11.646
This?

18
00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:12.564
Yeah.

19
00:10:12.689 --> 00:10:13.898
You like that?

20
00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.733
This is...

21
00:10:15.983 --> 00:10:17.402
my daughter's.

22
00:10:17.485 --> 00:10:18.653
She gave it to me.

23
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.071
You have a kid?

24
00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:22.657
Seriously? You have a kid?

25
00:10:22.865 --> 00:10:23.908
What's their name?

26
00:10:24.116 --> 00:10:24.992
Aoi.

27
00:10:25.076 --> 00:10:26.911
Huh. Cute name.

28
00:10:27.704 --> 00:10:31.166
But I've never seen you pregnant.

29
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.295
How old is she?

30
00:10:36.045 --> 00:10:37.672
Well, um...

31
00:10:47.056 --> 00:10:47.932
Don't worry.

32
00:10:48.057 --> 00:10:50.852
Well... I'm sorry.

33
00:10:55.064 --> 00:10:56.691
Hey, Miyabi.

34
00:10:57.859 --> 00:11:00.069
I'm gonna see my dad.

35
00:11:00.695 --> 00:11:02.071
That's nice.

36
00:11:02.739 --> 00:11:04.324
After this? His grave...

37
00:11:04.407 --> 00:11:08.077
My dad is super good-looking.

38
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:12.457
Not just good-looking
but kind and funny...


39
00:11:12.707 --> 00:11:15.793
He's also tall, and he has big hands...

40
00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:22.550
He often takes me to the park
and plays with me in the sand!


41
00:11:22.675 --> 00:11:25.052
He pushes me on the swing too!

42
00:11:26.137 --> 00:11:29.766
Oh, and he bakes with me too!

43
00:11:29.891 --> 00:11:32.018
Akari, you're called.

44
00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:34.145
Oh, OK!

45
00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:36.689
I'll wait in the car.

46
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.194
Hello, Suzuki here.

47
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:00.505
I'm not saying I won't pay.

48
00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:03.591
I just don't have it.

49
00:12:07.304 --> 00:12:08.596
You're leaving?

50
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.864
I'm sorry.

51
00:12:47.677 --> 00:12:54.809
A record number of food and beverage
businesses filed insolvency this quarter.


52
00:12:55.477 --> 00:12:58.688
On top of the labor shortage
and aging society,


53
00:12:58.771 --> 00:13:04.361
after the emergency,
many once-regular customers didn't return.


54
00:13:04.736 --> 00:13:06.238
This will have serious...

55
00:13:06.363 --> 00:13:08.030
This blows.

56
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:10.950
How's our industry gonna survive?

57
00:13:11.618 --> 00:13:13.536
We're on the verge too.

58
00:13:13.995 --> 00:13:16.206
Think about what to do next.

59
00:13:22.254 --> 00:13:25.340
Mr. Aizawa. Look, there's Akari.

60
00:13:26.966 --> 00:13:28.260
I'll pick her up.

61
00:14:24.148 --> 00:14:26.693
Stay in the car. 
Call an ambulance!

62
00:15:56.408 --> 00:15:57.950
You still shaken up?

63
00:16:00.328 --> 00:16:00.995
Hey.

64
00:16:11.714 --> 00:16:14.176
Sorry. I didn't hear you.

65
00:16:16.386 --> 00:16:19.472
I saw it on the news. 
A random slasher.

66
00:16:20.432 --> 00:16:22.600
That's your co-worker, right?

67
00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:24.936
She's not caught yet.

68
00:16:28.273 --> 00:16:30.442
Twelve people injured or killed.

69
00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:35.905
With the security footage,
they'll catch her soon.


70
00:16:44.372 --> 00:16:49.001
Last time I saw her at work,
she said she was gonna see her dad.


71
00:16:50.462 --> 00:16:54.216
But I heard her father passed away.

72
00:16:54.882 --> 00:16:58.345
What?
You think she's gonna kill herself?


73
00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:01.223
I don't think so.

74
00:17:02.682 --> 00:17:03.766
Then, what?

75
00:17:10.898 --> 00:17:12.149
Wanna go to the store?

76
00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:16.279
We're out of beer. 
Let's get some drinks.

77
00:17:17.947 --> 00:17:18.865
Yeah.

78
00:17:25.747 --> 00:17:26.956
One second.

79
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.417
You watered already.

80
00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:33.129
Well, maybe it wasn't enough.

81
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.548
The sun's strong lately.

82
00:17:42.639 --> 00:17:45.517
Let me do this. 
It'll take a second.

83
00:19:30.163 --> 00:19:32.749
You have no right to wear this.

84
00:19:40.757 --> 00:19:41.883
Pick 'em up.

85
00:19:44.386 --> 00:19:46.221
Pick them up.

86
00:20:01.361 --> 00:20:02.279
Who's this?

87
00:20:06.824 --> 00:20:07.950
Are you OK?

88
00:20:08.743 --> 00:20:09.661
What's going on?

89
00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:13.956
Oh I see. You're with this wimp now?

90
00:20:14.416 --> 00:20:16.000
What an embarrassment.

91
00:20:16.626 --> 00:20:18.253
When did it start?

92
00:20:18.795 --> 00:20:19.421
What?

93
00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:21.923
How was the sex? Was it good?

94
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.135
She does it with anyone.

95
00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:29.181
You know she's using you.

96
00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.296
I'll never forgive you
for ruining my life.


97
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.758
It's your fault that Aoi's dead.

98
00:21:07.594 --> 00:21:10.347
It's all your fault.

99
00:21:36.603 --> 00:21:37.249
Miyabi.

100
00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:43.045
There was a random murder
and arson incident at the museum.


101
00:21:43.671 --> 00:21:46.048
It says about 20 people died.

102
00:21:46.132 --> 00:21:49.261
Oh no. The place is all burnt out.

103
00:21:50.678 --> 00:21:54.932
For a second, I thought Akari did it.

104
00:22:02.982 --> 00:22:05.109
Ms. Utsumi. You got a patron.

105
00:22:05.193 --> 00:22:08.321
Suzuki, what's up with this light?

106
00:22:08.405 --> 00:22:11.491
Sorry.
This building's power is unstable.


107
00:22:14.994 --> 00:22:16.037
Later, girl.

108
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.205
Good luck.

109
00:22:24.212 --> 00:22:26.423
Miyabi. You got a patron.

110
00:22:35.682 --> 00:22:39.769
We're going to the guy
who was Akari's customer.


111
00:22:41.354 --> 00:22:44.566
I can ask him about her.

112
00:22:44.982 --> 00:22:46.818
Yeah, will you?

113
00:22:46.943 --> 00:22:48.736
Just don't offend him.

114
00:23:59.891 --> 00:24:01.643
You must be Miyabi.

115
00:24:02.101 --> 00:24:03.770
I've been waiting for you.

116
00:24:04.354 --> 00:24:06.564
Please come in.

117
00:24:40.014 --> 00:24:44.852
Some kinds of moths are capable
of long-distance flight.


118
00:24:45.228 --> 00:24:50.149
The fall armyworm is one
of the worst examples of this.


119
00:24:51.318 --> 00:24:58.908
It was first seen in Japan in 2019.

120
00:24:59.326 --> 00:25:03.079
It can spread across borders
and continents.


121
00:25:03.913 --> 00:25:07.167
How does it go over the ocean...

122
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.543
Excuse me.

123
00:25:09.085 --> 00:25:11.087
Could you turn on the light?

124
00:25:11.213 --> 00:25:13.923
Experts are sounding the alarm.

125
00:25:15.217 --> 00:25:20.388
Since it spread, there has been
no effective solution.


126
00:25:20.972 --> 00:25:26.394
Most of the measures
to exterminate them have failed.


127
00:25:27.103 --> 00:25:31.941
In Africa, Asia, and the United States
where they multiplied,


128
00:25:32.275 --> 00:25:35.695
active research is being conducted.

129
00:25:35.862 --> 00:25:36.696
Their growth is...

130
00:25:36.863 --> 00:25:39.282
Have you called me before too?

131
00:25:40.783 --> 00:25:42.452
You look familiar.

132
00:25:44.329 --> 00:25:45.705
I don't know.

133
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:49.167
Memories can't be trusted.

134
00:25:49.542 --> 00:25:55.465
New methods such as using
biological pesticides are being studied.


135
00:25:55.882 --> 00:25:59.177
But they haven't been put
to practical use.


136
00:25:59.261 --> 00:26:00.470
Years ago,

137
00:26:01.846 --> 00:26:03.848
I had throat cancer.

138
00:26:04.432 --> 00:26:06.142
I've been like this since.

139
00:26:07.143 --> 00:26:08.395
I'm sorry.

140
00:26:09.687 --> 00:26:12.399
I take pictures.

141
00:26:12.982 --> 00:26:15.277
May I take your picture?

142
00:26:16.152 --> 00:26:19.197
I'm sorry, I can't let you.

143
00:26:20.072 --> 00:26:21.783
Even without your face?

144
00:26:23.117 --> 00:26:27.622
What I'd like to take is
a picture of your spine.


145
00:26:28.331 --> 00:26:31.584
I'm sure that's OK, isn't it?

146
00:26:53.648 --> 00:26:55.107
Follow me.

147
00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:38.878
What a barbarous spine you have.

148
00:28:43.675 --> 00:28:47.011
Akari from our service committed murder.

149
00:28:49.222 --> 00:28:51.057
Many people died.

150
00:28:53.351 --> 00:28:54.561
And...

151
00:28:55.353 --> 00:28:59.816
The last customer she saw
before the incident was...


152
00:28:59.899 --> 00:29:01.568
It was you.

153
00:29:14.622 --> 00:29:19.001
Did you notice
anything different about her?


154
00:29:46.404 --> 00:29:48.448
Please write your name.

155
00:29:49.657 --> 00:29:51.909
Doesn't have to be your real name.

156
00:30:08.718 --> 00:30:10.595
"Miyabi"

157
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.806
Now let me take
a picture of your legs.

158
00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.723
Thank you for coming.

159
00:30:56.183 --> 00:30:57.600
I'll call you again.

160
00:31:18.205 --> 00:31:19.414
I've finished.

161
00:31:22.875 --> 00:31:24.001
That was quick.

162
00:31:48.193 --> 00:31:49.944
He just took your pictures?

163
00:31:50.195 --> 00:31:53.240
Smells like trouble. 
You know the rules.

164
00:31:53.823 --> 00:31:55.032
I'm sorry.

165
00:31:56.158 --> 00:31:58.203
No photo of your face, alright?

166
00:31:58.328 --> 00:32:01.206
That'll get us and you in trouble.

167
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.503
I asked about Akari
but didn't get anything.


168
00:32:08.838 --> 00:32:10.548
That Oka guy is...

169
00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:13.760
Never mind.

170
00:33:22.537 --> 00:33:25.373
"Akari Yanashita"

171
00:34:52.585 --> 00:34:54.296
You've watered that already.

172
00:34:54.712 --> 00:34:56.964
Oh, this is a nutrient.

173
00:34:57.089 --> 00:34:58.300
I don't care.

174
00:34:58.925 --> 00:34:59.801
Um...

175
00:35:00.802 --> 00:35:03.263
Did I do something wrong?

176
00:35:04.597 --> 00:35:08.601
Do you remember talking
about moving a while ago?


177
00:35:11.979 --> 00:35:14.065
I gave it some thought.

178
00:35:15.233 --> 00:35:20.447
If we move to countryside,
we can rent a house for the same price.


179
00:35:21.614 --> 00:35:23.115
I think that's better.

180
00:35:25.285 --> 00:35:27.287
But what about work?

181
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.332
I'll have to look for a new job.

182
00:35:31.458 --> 00:35:34.586
Don't worry about that.
I'll find one.


183
00:35:36.421 --> 00:35:39.924
Yeah? Let's talk about this
once you find one.


184
00:35:59.319 --> 00:36:00.362
Honestly,

185
00:36:01.028 --> 00:36:04.991
it's not good for you
to keep living in a place like this.


186
00:36:06.493 --> 00:36:07.619
What does that mean?

187
00:36:08.745 --> 00:36:10.622
I like this apartment.

188
00:36:13.958 --> 00:36:15.668
You shouldn't be stuck here.

189
00:36:18.671 --> 00:36:20.173
Don't touch that.

190
00:36:20.257 --> 00:36:21.466
Please.

191
00:36:24.969 --> 00:36:25.845
I'm sorry.

192
00:36:26.721 --> 00:36:28.223
Please give it back.

193
00:37:25.363 --> 00:37:26.489
Hello.

194
00:37:27.657 --> 00:37:29.659
I knew you'd come back.

195
00:38:13.995 --> 00:38:16.539
Your left arm please.

196
00:38:53.868 --> 00:38:58.080
Next time,
from your breast to the buttocks.


197
00:38:58.915 --> 00:39:02.585
The time after that,
neck up except for your eyes.


198
00:39:03.545 --> 00:39:08.508
Your nose, lips, and hair.

199
00:39:28.986 --> 00:39:30.988
Next, your ears.

200
00:39:31.656 --> 00:39:34.534
At last, your eyes.

201
00:39:50.717 --> 00:39:53.010
Akari didn't contact you, did she?

202
00:39:54.637 --> 00:39:55.513
No.

203
00:39:56.306 --> 00:39:59.684
Didn't think so. 
It's been two weeks.

204
00:40:07.442 --> 00:40:08.318
Stop the car.

205
00:40:08.735 --> 00:40:10.695
- This is fine.
- Alright.


206
00:40:55.823 --> 00:40:57.033
- Today...
- Hey...


207
00:40:58.201 --> 00:40:59.035
Go ahead.

208
00:41:00.036 --> 00:41:01.538
What did you do today?

209
00:41:01.996 --> 00:41:06.209
I went out around noon
to help someone record music.


210
00:41:07.502 --> 00:41:09.045
- That's it.
- Who is it?


211
00:41:09.212 --> 00:41:12.840
Oda. He's a musician I know
from college.


212
00:41:14.467 --> 00:41:16.135
We've just finished.

213
00:41:17.845 --> 00:41:20.848
In his neighborhood...

214
00:41:22.267 --> 00:41:25.603
...there was a botanical shop.

215
00:41:27.021 --> 00:41:31.025
And I got this. 
Hope you like it.

216
00:41:31.818 --> 00:41:32.777
What's this?

217
00:41:54.216 --> 00:41:56.509
Could you help me water these?

218
00:42:07.437 --> 00:42:08.188
Here.

219
00:42:09.897 --> 00:42:11.233
Where should I start?

220
00:42:11.399 --> 00:42:12.859
From this one.

221
00:42:12.984 --> 00:42:14.277
- This?
- Yeah.


222
00:42:26.164 --> 00:42:27.415
Sorry about yesterday.

223
00:42:28.583 --> 00:42:30.084
I'm sorry too.

224
00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.713
It's pretty.

225
00:42:34.547 --> 00:42:35.382
Right?

226
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:47.685
I'm thinking about holding
an event again.


227
00:42:49.103 --> 00:42:51.398
It'll be a fundraiser at the club.

228
00:42:52.148 --> 00:42:53.691
We can stream it too.

229
00:42:54.692 --> 00:42:58.405
I can invite Sato, 
Yuko, everybody.

230
00:42:59.113 --> 00:43:01.366
It's gonna be a big event.

231
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.245
I wanna come.

232
00:43:05.912 --> 00:43:07.914
I haven't seen everyone.

233
00:43:08.373 --> 00:43:10.625
Yeah? You really wanna come?

234
00:44:32.249 --> 00:44:33.708
Can I have a cigarette?

235
00:44:34.917 --> 00:44:38.671
That reminded me of the first time
I met you.


236
00:44:38.963 --> 00:44:40.423
Our first time?

237
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.676
I don't remember...

238
00:44:44.969 --> 00:44:46.929
I was smoking right here.

239
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:52.852
Then you came and asked me,
"Can I have a cigarette?"


240
00:44:55.104 --> 00:44:56.439
Exactly the same line.

241
00:44:56.773 --> 00:44:58.441
Don't remember that at all.

242
00:44:58.816 --> 00:45:00.610
I ignored you.

243
00:45:00.943 --> 00:45:04.071
Then you stole one
from me and lit up.

244
00:45:05.282 --> 00:45:06.658
I was horrible.

245
00:45:07.492 --> 00:45:11.120
Then, you went DJing after that.

246
00:45:11.288 --> 00:45:12.997
I did that night.

247
00:45:13.706 --> 00:45:18.085
While everyone was bored with your set,
I thought...


248
00:45:20.297 --> 00:45:21.964
No, I was bored too.

249
00:49:24.374 --> 00:49:25.625
What are those?

250
00:49:34.467 --> 00:49:35.677
I'll help you.

251
00:50:00.785 --> 00:50:02.078
Meant to ask...

252
00:50:02.537 --> 00:50:04.331
Did he take this picture?

253
00:50:06.374 --> 00:50:09.211
This picture.
Your ex-husband took it?


254
00:50:17.635 --> 00:50:18.845
I don't remember.

255
00:50:19.179 --> 00:50:20.347
You don't?

256
00:50:20.513 --> 00:50:22.014
Who else could've taken it?

257
00:50:22.599 --> 00:50:23.891
A random person?

258
00:56:43.062 --> 00:56:44.397
I have...

259
00:56:46.566 --> 00:56:49.236
I have met you before.

260
00:56:52.739 --> 00:56:54.031
That was...

261
00:56:57.202 --> 00:56:58.995
...at some beach.

262
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.083
No.

263
00:57:07.712 --> 00:57:10.965
It was a dream.

264
00:57:17.389 --> 00:57:22.018
Whose dream was it?

265
00:57:23.895 --> 00:57:28.400
You've been dreaming about her.

266
00:57:29.817 --> 00:57:31.944
In the dream,

267
00:57:32.904 --> 00:57:37.200
she's also dreaming about you.

268
00:57:39.619 --> 00:57:46.000
And then, you have a dream
about the dream she's having.


269
00:57:57.887 --> 00:58:00.307
You can now hear it.

270
00:58:01.308 --> 00:58:03.226
You can hear her voice.

271
00:58:13.611 --> 00:58:15.863
What did you do to Akari?

272
00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:20.327
I have saved her.

273
00:58:22.329 --> 00:58:24.664
Who I'm going to save next is...

274
00:58:25.623 --> 00:58:26.958
you.

275
00:58:30.628 --> 00:58:31.963
She's dead.

276
00:58:34.591 --> 00:58:36.301
She's alive.

277
00:58:37.177 --> 00:58:40.722
She's still in your home

278
00:58:42.139 --> 00:58:45.727
and dreaming about you.

279
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:18.218
"The alligators roar.
The frogs go 'Ribbit...'"


280
00:59:19.302 --> 00:59:22.054
Which one do you like? Neither?

281
00:59:24.641 --> 00:59:28.603
"The hippos splash in the river.
Swim, fish, swim!"


282
00:59:29.979 --> 00:59:31.606
"Swim, fish!"

283
00:59:33.691 --> 00:59:37.195
What's next? "The bunnies hop!"

284
00:59:56.173 --> 00:59:58.925
Oh, you're here.

285
01:00:02.804 --> 01:00:03.971
What're you doing?

286
01:00:06.516 --> 01:00:09.186
My daughter's here.

287
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:21.072
Where are you going?

288
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.311
What do you want for your birthday?

289
01:00:52.437 --> 01:00:53.646
A bear?

290
01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:55.690
But you have one.

291
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:32.435
Hello?

292
01:01:32.685 --> 01:01:37.190
Whoa. Good to hear you. You're alive.

293
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.318
You took a week off without notice.

294
01:01:41.486 --> 01:01:44.155
I'm sorry. Hadn't been feeling well.

295
01:01:44.989 --> 01:01:46.408
But I'm OK now.

296
01:01:50.203 --> 01:01:53.039
I have something I need to tell you.

297
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:55.292
Are you eating well?

298
01:01:55.583 --> 01:01:56.793
You lost weight.

299
01:01:57.252 --> 01:01:59.296
Am I talking to the dead?

300
01:02:11.183 --> 01:02:13.851
1965-08.

301
01:02:18.856 --> 01:02:23.320
After middle school, Akari worked
part-time as a cleaner.


302
01:02:23.861 --> 01:02:26.531
She only has her mom,
and she's schizophrenic.


303
01:02:26.614 --> 01:02:29.201
She lost her dad when she was little.

304
01:02:29.742 --> 01:02:32.787
When her mom's condition worsened,

305
01:02:32.995 --> 01:02:36.624
she started working for us
to cover the medical bills.


306
01:02:37.292 --> 01:02:40.295
Her mom was physically abusing Akari.

307
01:02:45.967 --> 01:02:48.720
"He stroked my hair today."

308
01:02:49.596 --> 01:02:51.931
"I hope he'll pick me up early."

309
01:02:52.974 --> 01:02:57.479
"Dad welcomed me
when I came home today."


310
01:02:58.188 --> 01:03:04.319
"Mom might be nice to me
once she realizes Dad is still with us."


311
01:03:08.573 --> 01:03:12.869
Is Oka doing anything to you
other than taking your pictures?


312
01:03:13.453 --> 01:03:16.038
He doesn't offer you any drinks?

313
01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.045
Akari's mental state went
rapidly downhill since she met Oka.


314
01:03:23.796 --> 01:03:24.797
It's crazy.

315
01:03:30.678 --> 01:03:32.680
I don't think it's crazy.

316
01:03:35.558 --> 01:03:39.562
Her life has thrown her things
she couldn't endure.


317
01:03:40.272 --> 01:03:42.815
And she must've flipped one day.

318
01:03:43.358 --> 01:03:45.485
She's done unforgivable things.

319
01:03:47.195 --> 01:03:48.696
God is cruel, isn't He?

320
01:03:49.572 --> 01:03:52.200
He should cut her some slack.

321
01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:01.626
By the way,

322
01:04:02.919 --> 01:04:04.921
I thought you were dead.

323
01:04:05.422 --> 01:04:06.423
Seriously.

324
01:04:26.318 --> 01:04:30.322
Utsumi,
what are you always listening to?


325
01:04:30.863 --> 01:04:34.701
Oh, this? It's a
demo from my old band.

326
01:04:35.117 --> 01:04:36.578
You were in a band?

327
01:04:37.995 --> 01:04:41.833
Bunch of stuff happened,
and we broke up.


328
01:04:41.916 --> 01:04:43.251
And...

329
01:04:44.836 --> 01:04:47.547
No, I don't wanna talk about it.

330
01:05:02.437 --> 01:05:03.646
It's gonna be out.

331
01:05:10.903 --> 01:05:16.158
At around 4:00 p.m. today, there was
an explosion at the art museum.


332
01:05:16.326 --> 01:05:21.831
Many visitors were injured
in the explosion.


333
01:05:21.956 --> 01:05:26.169
Fire rescue operations are still going on.

334
01:05:26.336 --> 01:05:34.135
Many "National Treasure" picture scrolls
and other cultural assets have been lost.


335
01:05:34.219 --> 01:05:39.766
Experts claim that
there is immeasurable cultural loss.


336
01:05:39.932 --> 01:05:44.396
Before the incident,
a suspect in a murder case last month,


337
01:05:44.479 --> 01:05:48.316
Akari Yanashita,
was spotted at the museum.


338
01:05:48.441 --> 01:05:51.944
The police are investigating
the connection.


339
01:05:52.028 --> 01:05:55.323
Yanashita is also wanted

340
01:05:55.407 --> 01:05:59.118
for the murder of her own mother
right before the killing spree.


341
01:05:59.202 --> 01:06:01.163
We've just received the news!

342
01:06:01.246 --> 01:06:05.750
Temples, kindergartens, and hospitals
in the city


343
01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:08.503
have simultaneously been bombed.

344
01:06:08.586 --> 01:06:13.883
A premeditated act of terrorism is
suspected by the police.


345
01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.237
Let's sing the song.

346
01:06:35.988 --> 01:06:36.781
Shall we?

347
01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.741
One, two!

348
01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:58.135
Happy birthday, Aoi!

349
01:07:00.054 --> 01:07:02.056
Let's blow out the candles.

350
01:08:07.455 --> 01:08:09.666
I'm not just a driver.

351
01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:15.922
I have to make sure they're safe,
so I did some research.


352
01:08:17.089 --> 01:08:20.260
I noticed Miyabi hasn't
been herself lately.


353
01:08:20.343 --> 01:08:24.931
I'm suspecting that one
of the patrons is giving her drugs.


354
01:08:26.808 --> 01:08:28.726
How is she?

355
01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:30.895
I don't think it's drugs.

356
01:08:31.313 --> 01:08:32.939
Something else.

357
01:08:33.606 --> 01:08:34.649
Huh.

358
01:08:35.525 --> 01:08:37.944
She's hallucinating her dead kid.

359
01:08:38.528 --> 01:08:39.612
She had a kid?

360
01:08:41.573 --> 01:08:42.865
I'll give you this.

361
01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.457
Are you two doing drugs?

362
01:08:59.674 --> 01:09:03.010
There were times we were using.

363
01:09:04.887 --> 01:09:09.141
I assure you, she's not using.
That's not drugs.


364
01:09:09.726 --> 01:09:11.436
It's something else.

365
01:09:13.521 --> 01:09:17.192
Has she mentioned the customer
who takes her photos?


366
01:09:21.321 --> 01:09:25.617
I think she did... about a month ago.

367
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.868
What about it?

368
01:09:31.206 --> 01:09:34.459
Well... never mind.

369
01:09:43.676 --> 01:09:46.804
She's having a birthday party
for her dead child.


370
01:09:54.187 --> 01:09:57.357
I thought I was doing everything
I could do...


371
01:10:00.026 --> 01:10:02.028
But it was all waste of time.

372
01:10:30.139 --> 01:10:31.140
Miyabi?

373
01:11:15.852 --> 01:11:17.979
You took the photo, didn't you?

374
01:11:22.275 --> 01:11:24.110
I'm aware of everything.

375
01:11:24.861 --> 01:11:26.613
But it doesn't matter.

376
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:29.657
Aoi won't go away.

377
01:11:29.907 --> 01:11:31.659
She's still with me!

378
01:12:10.615 --> 01:12:11.866
You know...

379
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:14.952
No one can replace you.

380
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:20.833
So... I can't give you up.

381
01:12:25.297 --> 01:12:27.257
I want to spend...

382
01:12:28.508 --> 01:12:30.802
...the rest of my life with you.

383
01:12:35.765 --> 01:12:39.227
We can have events
at the club again.


384
01:12:40.645 --> 01:12:42.146
We'll all have fun.

385
01:12:45.608 --> 01:12:47.026
And in the end,

386
01:12:49.196 --> 01:12:52.490
I want us to
grow old and die together.

387
01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:01.666
But everything has an end.

388
01:13:03.418 --> 01:13:07.129
So we can't be together forever.

389
01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.384
I think...

390
01:13:16.181 --> 01:13:19.726
if you can forget "forever,"

391
01:13:21.436 --> 01:13:22.979
you'll see.

392
01:13:25.898 --> 01:13:26.941
See what?

393
01:13:31.153 --> 01:13:32.489
My love for everything.

394
01:13:49.046 --> 01:13:50.590
I...

395
01:13:53.218 --> 01:13:54.802
I don't love anymore.

396
01:13:57.472 --> 01:13:58.806
I can't find it.

397
01:14:01.142 --> 01:14:02.394
My heart's empty

398
01:14:03.853 --> 01:14:05.522
like from before I had a child.

399
01:14:07.524 --> 01:14:09.401
That's who I am.

400
01:14:42.141 --> 01:14:43.476
Mom.

401
01:14:44.561 --> 01:14:46.145
Come to my room.

402
01:14:50.192 --> 01:14:51.359
Mom.

403
01:14:53.903 --> 01:14:56.030
Read a book for me.

404
01:15:35.987 --> 01:15:41.659
Via complete metamorphosis,
insects build cocoons by spinning silk.


405
01:15:41.743 --> 01:15:45.872
Then they go through
the dormant pupal stage.


406
01:15:46.373 --> 01:15:51.211
Inside, except certain muscles
and parts of the nervous system,


407
01:15:51.419 --> 01:15:57.133
a larval body supported by organs
and tissues is no longer needed.


408
01:15:57.217 --> 01:16:02.764
The body is broken down
by enzymes called caspases.


409
01:16:02.847 --> 01:16:08.395
The body breaks down to thick fluid
and fills the inside of the cocoon.


410
01:16:08.978 --> 01:16:13.525
This intricate process follows
a genetic schedule.


411
01:16:13.608 --> 01:16:16.194
It is programmed cell death.

412
01:16:16.736 --> 01:16:22.325
Then the specialized cells called
imaginal discs are


413
01:16:22.409 --> 01:16:25.787
woken up by the digestive fluid.

414
01:16:25.953 --> 01:16:32.210
The discs start to build the adult's eyes,
legs, and other body parts.


415
01:16:32.919 --> 01:16:39.467
Once the transformation is complete,
they look different from the larva stage.


416
01:17:37.734 --> 01:17:41.821
"Akari"

417
01:18:30.495 --> 01:18:34.582
"Miyabi"

418
01:18:43.883 --> 01:18:47.595
"Kosuke"

419
01:19:08.032 --> 01:19:12.119
"Kosuke"

420
01:22:45.124 --> 01:22:47.502
I'm done for the day.

421
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:49.003
Where's Mr. Aizawa?

422
01:22:49.171 --> 01:22:51.756
He didn't show today.
Wonder why.


423
01:22:52.632 --> 01:22:53.675
Mr. Suzuki.

424
01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:54.634
Yes?

425
01:22:55.134 --> 01:22:58.305
Would you mind taking me somewhere?

426
01:22:58.471 --> 01:22:59.514
Not at all.

427
01:22:59.764 --> 01:23:02.642
Oh, you're done today.
See you outside.


428
01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:19.826
Miyabi.

429
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:23.830
Um...

430
01:23:25.207 --> 01:23:26.958
Dunno how to put this...

431
01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:30.378
I looked like Akari?

432
01:23:36.884 --> 01:23:38.511
I'm fine.

433
01:23:39.679 --> 01:23:40.680
See you soon.

434
01:23:44.559 --> 01:23:45.685
Alright.

435
01:24:21.388 --> 01:24:26.434
You've given me this dream,
but what do you want from me?


436
01:24:29.479 --> 01:24:30.563
History.

437
01:24:40.323 --> 01:24:43.868
One night, I had a dream.

438
01:24:45.203 --> 01:24:51.042
In the dream, I was a moth.

439
01:24:53.586 --> 01:24:59.384
But the moth was also having a dream
in which I was in it.


440
01:25:03.095 --> 01:25:07.892
I'm the moth which the moth sees
in his dream.


441
01:25:08.518 --> 01:25:12.772
But the moth is also myself,
which I see in my dream.


442
01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:23.466
And I got to know
that anybody can stare back at the moth.


443
01:25:28.319 --> 01:25:37.328
You can have everything
you've ever wished for by staring at it.


444
01:25:49.476 --> 01:25:56.733
It could be your dear daughter
or someone who doesn't exist.


445
01:25:59.861 --> 01:26:04.366
There's no beginning or end
in a moth's life.


446
01:26:06.075 --> 01:26:11.289
Moths are envious of living things
with a history.


447
01:26:12.457 --> 01:26:13.708
You.

448
01:26:15.293 --> 01:26:16.169
Her.

449
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.381
Existence.

450
01:26:30.099 --> 01:26:32.685
From every cocoon,

451
01:26:33.228 --> 01:26:37.232
a new history will be born.

452
01:27:57.604 --> 01:27:59.063
What's going on?

453
01:28:16.831 --> 01:28:18.791
You're good at this.

454
01:28:29.010 --> 01:28:31.221
Do you know what this is?

455
01:28:31.846 --> 01:28:33.097
I don't know.

456
01:28:33.431 --> 01:28:34.766
Can you tell me?

457
01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:37.269
Aromaticus.

458
01:28:37.352 --> 01:28:39.437
Aromaticus, huh?

459
01:28:39.562 --> 01:28:40.730
Great.

460
01:28:41.773 --> 01:28:43.024
What about this?

461
01:28:43.650 --> 01:28:44.692
Rouge plant.

462
01:28:44.859 --> 01:28:48.070
Rouge plant? You really know plants!

463
01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.697
How about...?

464
01:29:04.212 --> 01:29:06.464
I don't know what that is.

465
01:29:07.215 --> 01:29:08.300
This is...

466
01:29:10.885 --> 01:29:11.886
This is...

467
01:29:13.846 --> 01:29:15.765
I actually don't know.

468
01:29:43.626 --> 01:29:44.461
Aoi.

469
01:29:49.299 --> 01:29:50.800
Aoi.

470
01:29:55.805 --> 01:29:57.640
This is my dream.

471
01:29:58.891 --> 01:30:00.227
You're not real.

472
01:30:00.768 --> 01:30:03.646
What are you talking about, Mommy?

473
01:30:06.358 --> 01:30:11.028
You... fell from the balcony
and died three years ago.


474
01:30:12.197 --> 01:30:13.990
Because I wasn't watching.

475
01:30:16.368 --> 01:30:17.369
I'm sorry.

476
01:30:18.703 --> 01:30:19.746
I'm so sorry.

477
01:30:21.456 --> 01:30:23.833
It hurt, Mommy.

478
01:30:23.958 --> 01:30:25.960
It really hurt.

479
01:30:26.461 --> 01:30:27.462
I'm sorry.

480
01:30:28.755 --> 01:30:29.839
So sorry.

481
01:30:39.098 --> 01:30:40.767
I'll see you someday.

482
01:30:42.394 --> 01:30:44.437
It won't be too long.

483
01:30:47.399 --> 01:30:54.281
You are... the only thing that matters
to me in the whole wide world.


484
01:33:13.461 --> 01:33:14.629
Mommy?

485
01:33:24.347 --> 01:33:26.308
I had a scary dream.

486
01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:32.104
What's wrong, Mommy?

487
01:33:41.448 --> 01:33:47.287
"Miyabi"

488
01:34:21.863 --> 01:34:26.326
"Curriculum Vitae"

489
01:35:00.235 --> 01:35:01.194
Miyabi?

490
01:35:04.739 --> 01:35:05.865
You're home.

491
01:35:08.201 --> 01:35:09.494
Can we talk?

492
01:39:10.568 --> 01:39:15.072
A woman drove into a school
in a car filled with explosive gas.


493
01:39:15.198 --> 01:39:18.326
Her car crashed into the building
and exploded.


494
01:39:18.451 --> 01:39:20.745
Some saw her walk away from the scene.

495
01:39:20.828 --> 01:39:25.375
The main roads have been blocked
to search cars.
