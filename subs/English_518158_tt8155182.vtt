You're the thing my mom always
said was real.

She wasn't crazy.

504
00:35:56.165 --> 00:35:58.400
Crazy to think she could get rid
of me forever.


505
00:35:58.402 --> 00:35:59.868
Her and her friends tried.

506
00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:03.772
They watched me melt and
threw me down the well to rot!

taken from my friend's bowels

I was able to reform
at my discretion.

It's not a trick.
