to the New Jersey Mathlympics State Final.

I've seen the best of the best,

but I have never seen anything
like this young man here.

has dominated this contest

-since the very first equation.
-[presenter 2] Absolutely.

[chuckles] Now the question, of course,
on everyone's mind here today is,

"Can this youngster win it all?"

00:15:03.706 --> 00:15:04.706
A homework assignment.

308
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.081
Of course. Math homework?

309
00:15:06.165 --> 00:15:07.456
It's about Dad.

310
00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:11.623
Sorry.

311
00:15:11.706 --> 00:15:13.748
I know you don't
like to talk about him.

312
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.290
Suresh would want us to be happy.

-Huh?
-This needs pepper.


315
00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:23.206
So, what do you need for your homework?

316
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.831
-What was he known for?
-Known for?


317
00:15:25.915 --> 00:15:30.040
-I mean, was he smart?
-Definitely, but he wasn't a math guy.


318
00:15:30.123 --> 00:15:32.290
-What kind of guy was he?
-[sighs] There it is.


319
00:15:32.373 --> 00:15:35.581
I'll never know who I am
unless I know who he was.


320
00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:36.665
He was…

321
00:15:38.706 --> 00:15:41.248
funny, confident, handsome.

322
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:44.040
-He was like you. Everyone loved him.
-Doesn't sound like me at all.


323
00:15:44.123 --> 00:15:46.206
I'm sorry.
I don't really know how to help.


324
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.123
Just tell me anything.

325
00:15:48.206 --> 00:15:50.915
Tell me about the night
that photo was taken.


326
00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.790
That was a very long time ago.

327
00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:59.373
What's the Leopard Lounge?

328
00:16:00.956 --> 00:16:02.498
It's the club where we met.

329
00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:04.706
-Like a dance club?
-A hip-hop club.


330
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.498
Your father had a real way with words.

331
00:16:06.581 --> 00:16:08.873
Wait. Dad was a rapper?

332
00:16:08.956 --> 00:16:11.915
How else do you think he came up with,
"The world's best never rest"?


333
00:16:11.998 --> 00:16:13.998
Mom, that is so cool.

334
00:16:14.081 --> 00:16:15.123
Was he good?

335
00:16:17.873 --> 00:16:18.915
He was…

336
00:16:20.456 --> 00:16:22.248
one of the best I've ever seen.

337
00:16:24.415 --> 00:16:25.998
I wish you could've seen him.

338
00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:36.373
Sometimes I forget how he looked
and how he sounded.


339
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:44.581
Okay. [chuckles]

340
00:16:44.665 --> 00:16:49.581
So, when I was in nursing school,
we used to go dancing on the weekends.


341
00:16:50.165 --> 00:16:53.748
My girlfriends told me about this place.
It was poppin'.


342
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.998
[mother] And the Leopard Lounge had
this thing called Freestyle Tuesdays.


343
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:04.415
You said you only went on weekends.

344
00:17:04.498 --> 00:17:06.581
Well, some Tuesdays. 
Not if we had exams.

345
00:17:06.665 --> 00:17:08.290
I don't need to explain myself.

346
00:17:08.373 --> 00:17:09.831
Anyway, you were at the club.

347
00:17:09.915 --> 00:17:12.373
We were at the club,
and my girlfriends were saying…


348
00:17:12.456 --> 00:17:14.831
This emcee's an underground legend.

349
00:17:14.915 --> 00:17:16.790
-Blah, blah, blah, blah.
-Blah, blah.


350

-Blah, blah. [chuckles]
-Why are they…


351
00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:19.623
I wasn't really listening.

352
00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:23.123
-Blah, blah, blah.
-Blah, blah, blah, blah.


353
00:17:23.206 --> 00:17:25.748
I had a lot
on my mind, like school--

354
00:17:25.831 --> 00:17:27.998
Priya, stop thinking about Doug. Okay?

355
00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:29.998
It's over. He's not even that cute.

356
00:17:30.081 --> 00:17:31.415
Who's Doug?

357
00:17:31.498 --> 00:17:33.498
Who? I don't know.
I can't really remember--


358
00:17:33.581 --> 00:17:36.706
Good thing we stopped you
from getting that tattoo of his name, huh?


359
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.706
We literally saved your butt.

360
00:17:50.248 --> 00:17:52.748
[friend 1] Hey, girl.
We'll go grab our drinks.


361
00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.331
So, we get in, and we're waiting
for the show to start when--

I just wanted to meet you.

00:18:11.998 --> 00:18:13.290
My name's Suresh.

-I'm not interested.

-That's what you said to Dad?


368
00:18:18.706 --> 00:18:20.415
I didn't feel like being hit on.

369

-Would you like to have a drink?
-No.


370

I don't drink anything ever.

-Then why are you in a nightclub?
-Thank you. Bye.


372
00:18:26.873 --> 00:18:28.373
I wanna walk away. I really do.

373
00:18:28.456 --> 00:18:30.748
-Please do.
-Yes. You've set a clear boundary.


374
00:18:30.831 --> 00:18:33.623
The only problem is
you're the prettiest girl in the room.

-Oh?
-And I just have this thing inside of me

you're the smartest.

-How did you know I was smart?


381

I could tell from your footwear,
'cause it's very sensible for a nightclub.


382

-Also, if it gets cold…
-[Priya] Uh-huh.

You were yelling.

Yeah, I'm fine.

Um, I was factoring a polynomial,
and the solution snuck up on me.

[sighs] I love it when that happens.

you're, like, my imaginary friend?

484
00:25:05.206 --> 00:25:06.290
Yeah, kinda.

485

Wow. What a beautiful picture.

491

[Suresh] You think this is crazy?

Little man, I'm basically
a fever dream wearing boots.


493

And they're heavy.

494
00:25:26.331 --> 00:25:28.081
I'm too old for an imaginary friend.

495
00:25:28.165 --> 00:25:31.956
Well, you're too young
for a midlife crisis, but here we are.

So, who is Prem Patel?

Who is he gonna be?

498
00:25:42.581 --> 00:25:43.831
I don't know.

499
00:25:43.915 --> 00:25:48.123
Hey. Every problem has a solution,
little man.


500
00:25:48.206 --> 00:25:49.248
And you and me,

501
00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:52.873
we are gonna figure
this one out together, okay?


502
00:25:52.956 --> 00:25:57.748
Sometimes you just have to add
a brand-new variable

to change the whole equation.

00:53:09.456 --> 00:53:12.456
Phony rappers knock other people down
to build themselves up.


1068
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.290
Real emcees, like us,
we own who we are.

1069
00:53:16.373 --> 00:53:18.123
That's what makes us untouchable.

1070
00:53:18.206 --> 00:53:21.623
Like Mercedes's superpower?

1071
00:53:21.706 --> 00:53:23.623
Exactly like that. 
Let me see that.

1072
00:53:24.123 --> 00:53:29.706
Look, it's the difference between running
your mouth and having something to say.


1073
00:53:52.706 --> 00:53:53.706
Yikes.

1074
00:53:56.081 --> 00:53:57.331
Oh.

1075
00:53:57.415 --> 00:53:59.373
Hey, Priya. How have you been?

1076
00:53:59.456 --> 00:54:02.248
-Busy. Stressed. So, the usual.
-[Mr. Oh] Hmm. Yeah.


1077
00:54:02.331 --> 00:54:04.456
-I get it. [chuckles]
-Yeah. You?


1078
00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:06.623
Same.
I feel like a fifth of my former self.


1079
00:54:07.665 --> 00:54:09.831
But my therapist says I'm two-tenths.
[chuckles]


1080
00:54:09.915 --> 00:54:10.915
[chuckles, snorts] Okay.

1081
00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:12.873
-That's really bad.
-I couldn't resist.


1082
00:54:12.956 --> 00:54:13.790
[both chuckling]

1083
00:54:15.706 --> 00:54:17.165
-We should--
-Sorry if I made it weird.


1084
00:54:17.248 --> 00:54:19.040
-No. It's fine.
-I was out of line to ask you out.


1085
00:54:19.123 --> 00:54:20.790
No, no. Not out of line. It's just--

1086
00:54:20.873 --> 00:54:21.831
Tacky.

1087
00:54:22.415 --> 00:54:23.831
You're Prem's teacher.

1088
00:54:23.915 --> 00:54:26.123
Well, technically not anymore.

1089
00:54:26.206 --> 00:54:27.998
He just might not understand if we--

1090
00:54:28.081 --> 00:54:30.873
He
-He understands calculus, but…

1091
00:54:31.873 --> 00:54:33.331
Emotionally.

1092
00:54:33.915 --> 00:54:34.915
Emotionally.

1093
00:54:35.873 --> 00:54:37.165
He's so into her.

1094
00:54:37.248 --> 00:54:38.831
-[Priya giggles]
-I told you.


1095
00:54:38.915 --> 00:54:41.206
So, have you told the girl's parents
what happened?


1096
00:54:41.290 --> 00:54:44.456
You know,
their houseboat doesn't have a phone.


1097
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.956
So I could try writing them
a letter or something.


1098
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.873
But you know, I
think Claire will be fine.

1099
00:54:48.956 --> 00:54:52.123
It's uh-
- It's Prem who worries me.

1100
00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:53.290
Yeah.

1101
00:54:53.373 --> 00:54:55.706
The fight was over an old notebook.

1102
00:54:56.206 --> 00:54:58.081
Prem said it belonged to his dad.

1103
00:54:58.873 --> 00:55:01.206
He signed up for the talent show
as the World's Best…


1104
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:04.373
Riding in cars with high schoolers?
What are their names?


1105
00:55:04.456 --> 00:55:05.790
[gasps] Do they vape?

1106
00:55:05.873 --> 00:55:08.623
-Mom.
-And what happened to your hair?


1107
00:55:08.706 --> 00:55:10.373
They're helping me get ready for the show.

1108
00:55:10.456 --> 00:55:13.081
No, you're quitting the show.
You need to focus on your schoolwork.


1109
00:55:13.165 --> 00:55:15.540
Mom, please. I can't let the haters win.

1110
00:55:15.623 --> 00:55:17.748
-Winning isn't everything.
-Since when?


1111
00:55:18.998 --> 00:55:20.748
You push me to
be the best at math,

1112
00:55:20.831 --> 00:55:22.831
but when I wanna be the best
at something else,


1113
00:55:22.915 --> 00:55:24.123
it's not important.

1114
00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:27.165
You love math. 
You have a gift.

1115
00:55:27.248 --> 00:55:28.748
It's just not cool anymore.

1116
00:55:30.456 --> 00:55:31.498
Give me the notebook.

1117
00:55:31.581 --> 00:55:32.873
It's a rhyme book.

1118
00:55:32.956 --> 00:55:34.665
You didn't even know it existed.

1119
00:55:34.748 --> 00:55:37.581
You just threw his stuff in a box
and shoved it in a closet.


1120
00:55:37.665 --> 00:55:40.040
-Prem.
-I need it to learn how to rap.


1121
00:55:40.123 --> 00:55:43.415
-My dad was the World's Best Emcee.
-That is not--


1122
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.748
This obsession with your father
isn't healthy.


1123
00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:51.248
We have to move on.

1124
00:55:51.331 --> 00:55:52.706
I listened to a whole podcast--

1125
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:55.831
Acting like he never existed
isn't moving on.


1126
00:55:57.706 --> 00:55:59.206
I'm not doing this with you.

1127
00:55:59.706 --> 00:56:01.206
-Give me the notebook. Now.
-No.


1128
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:03.748
-He'd want me to have it.
-You don't know what he'd want.


1129
00:56:03.831 --> 00:56:04.831
You didn't know him.

1130
00:56:10.998 --> 00:56:14.831
I mean, Suresh didn't
want you to be him.

1131
00:56:15.581 --> 00:56:18.540
He wanted you to work hard
and get good grades, a good job--


1132
00:56:18.623 --> 00:56:19.665
So I can be you?

1133
00:56:22.415 --> 00:56:23.415
[sighs]

1134
00:56:27.915 --> 00:56:29.915
[Ms. Sage] Okay.
I've got the 50 Lunchables.


1135
00:56:29.998 --> 00:56:31.290
I'll add the 30 granola bars.

1136
00:56:31.373 --> 00:56:34.790
And that'll be enough for
the State Mathlympics snack table.


1137
00:56:34.873 --> 00:56:37.331
[gasps]
It's right around the corner, people.


1138
00:56:37.415 --> 00:56:38.956
We still haven't locked in a judge,

1139
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.956
but I got a soft yes
from Neil Patrick Harris.


1140
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.748
[laughs] You know, 
I taught Neil.

1141
00:56:44.831 --> 00:56:47.331
He was actually a great math student.

1142
00:56:47.831 --> 00:56:49.665
He could've been an accountant.

-Why?
