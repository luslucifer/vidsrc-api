<i>Which reminds me, I need you</i>
<i>to pick up my gout medication.</i>


154
00:07:43.584 --> 00:07:45.686
Enough with the intercom talk.
I'm in a hurry. Buzz me in!


155
00:07:45.753 --> 00:07:46.854
(DOOR LOCK BUZZES, UNLOCKS)

156
00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:50.224
I was this close, Gord.
Not to riddle you with guilt...


157
00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:52.192
But you will.
...but I was right there.


158
00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:55.529
I was on the cusp
of figuring out why Mr. Devereux


159
00:07:55.596 --> 00:07:58.432
is suddenly called to the stand
by his paramour.


160
00:07:58.866 --> 00:08:00.567
(SIGHS)
But enough about my shitty book.


161
00:08:00.634 --> 00:08:04.104
What's your big emergency?
Isn't it a little early
for Scotch, Dad?


162
00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:05.306
With your gout also.

163
00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:07.341
Not when you've had
writer's block for two months.


164
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:10.411
Gotta fuel the fire
of creativity. Help yourself.


165
00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:12.112
You know, they... they tend
to frown on day drinking


166
00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:14.415
when you teach middle school.
I want to talk to you...


167
00:08:15.783 --> 00:08:17.685
about Sophie.
PETER: Aw!


168
00:08:18.285 --> 00:08:21.055
Well, it was never gonna last.
No, we're not breaking up.


169
00:08:21.255 --> 00:08:25.025
When it happens, I'll be here,
wasting away on a novel


170
00:08:25.092 --> 00:08:27.728
that won't even make it
to an airport kiosk!


171
00:08:27.828 --> 00:08:29.263
Can you listen to me
for one second?


172
00:08:29.496 --> 00:08:33.033
She just got offered this huge
job interview in Quebec City.


173
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.304
And whether she gets it or not,
I realized that she's the one.


174
00:08:37.838 --> 00:08:39.807
I don't wanna be
with anyone else ever again.


175
00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:42.209
And... and I'm gonna
fly up there with her.


176
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.644
Flying?
Yeah.


177
00:08:44.011 --> 00:08:45.779
You haven't been on a plane
since you were 13.


178
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.549
You remember
how that panic attack went?
GORDON: I know.


179
00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:49.650
Luckily for the passengers,

180
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.618
my little arms
weren't strong enough


181
00:08:51.685 --> 00:08:52.820
to get the emergency hatch out.

182
00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:54.722
But... (INHALES)
...I'm gonna do it.


183
00:08:54.823 --> 00:08:57.024
And that leaves me
to the real reason I'm here...


184
00:08:58.292 --> 00:08:59.426
Mom's ring.

185
00:09:02.663 --> 00:09:04.198
My God!
Yeah.


186
00:09:04.365 --> 00:09:06.100
My son is a genius!

187
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.503
How so?
Marrying Sophie
to get Canadian citizenship.


188
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.738
It's brilliant!
No, Dad, I--


189
00:09:10.804 --> 00:09:13.707
It's gotta be a formality
to get your old man a passport.


190
00:09:13.842 --> 00:09:16.944
This country has been
in a goddamn free fall


191
00:09:17.077 --> 00:09:18.379
since Vietnam!
We gotta get up there


192
00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:21.749
and beat the rush.
It's not an immigration ploy.
She's my soul mate!


193
00:09:21.882 --> 00:09:24.051
Say it just like that
to the people at the border.


194
00:09:24.218 --> 00:09:26.353
Dad, where is the ring?
The ring. The...


195
00:09:28.188 --> 00:09:29.289
Yes, of course. The ring.

196
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.459
Mr. Devereux left it
in Daphne's carriage!


197
00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:33.828
That's how she knew!

198
00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:36.563
That's how I end
this God forsaken chapter!


199
00:09:36.697 --> 00:09:37.731
I'm gonna go check your bedroom.

200

GINETTE:

207
00:10:10.697 --> 00:10:12.867
Check out this bling. What?

208
00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:15.536
I know. It belonged
to my great-grandmother,


209
00:10:15.602 --> 00:10:19.373
Gertrude. She came all the way
from Ireland aboard the Titanic.


210
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.043
Isn't that crazy?
Against all odds, it survived,


211
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.212
even though she was down
in third class,


212
00:10:25.312 --> 00:10:27.481
river dancing with Leo.
Isn't she nice?


213
00:10:27.581 --> 00:10:30.150
(RING CLATTERS)
Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Okay.
Who's got eyes on it?


214
00:10:30.217 --> 00:10:31.752
Don't move an inch.
Nobody move an inch!


215
00:10:31.952 --> 00:10:33.187
That is a precious heirloom.

216
00:10:33.454 --> 00:10:35.556
Look down and see
if you see sparkle.


217
00:10:35.857 --> 00:10:37.291
I got it!
Thank you. Whoo!


218
00:10:37.357 --> 00:10:39.059
You just went from a B to an A,
young lady. (CHUCKLES)


219
00:10:39.226 --> 00:10:41.462
Why is it rusty?
It's not rusty. It's an antique.


220
00:10:41.762 --> 00:10:42.963
That's not even a diamond.

221
00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:44.264
It's a diamond, trust me.

222
00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:45.999
It's just cloudy
from the seawater.


223
00:10:46.066 --> 00:10:48.235
Diamonds are a tool
of emotional manipulation


224
00:10:48.302 --> 00:10:50.872
contrived by baby boomers.
Okay, Greta Thunberg, thank you.


225
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:52.573
Show and tell is over.
You guys are a bad buzz.

SAMUEL: Mr. Kinski?
Yes, Samuel, go for it.


227
00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:56.143
I think he's gonna say yes.

228
00:10:56.243 --> 00:10:59.780
Okay, well, he is a woman.
And I hope that she says yes.


229
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.749
I mean, she doesn't care
about material wealth,


230
00:11:02.884 --> 00:11:04.853
like some people.
She likes simple things.


231

Then you're her man!
GORDON: Hilarious.


232

Chase, I told you to try out
for improv. You chose hockey.

All right, let's get into this.

234

(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
Oh, man! I really am late.


235
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.963
I'm so sorry.
Have a great summer!


236
00:11:15.062 --> 00:11:17.397
And, uh, please read!

<i>We'll resume drink service</i>
<i>momentarily. Thank you.</i>


243
00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:36.016
That's a lot of shaking, huh?
I think that's too much shaking.
SOPHIE: It's supposed to shake.


244
00:11:36.316 --> 00:11:39.253
It's like a car
on a country road. It's fine.


245
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:42.222
I don't know if you clocked
the flight attendant.


246
00:11:42.289 --> 00:11:44.826
Not smiling.
And they're trained to smile.


247
00:11:45.259 --> 00:11:46.460
Okay, let me distract myself

248
00:11:46.527 --> 00:11:47.761
by working
on the things I memorized.


249
00:11:47.962 --> 00:11:51.465
Your father's name is Alphonse.
Your mother's name is Ginette.


250
00:11:51.532 --> 00:11:54.334
They met in high school.
Your sister's name is Juliette.


251
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:55.702
She just had a baby.
Yep.


252
00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:58.272
And her baby daddy left her
and went back to Romania,


253
00:11:58.405 --> 00:11:59.974
so your brother, Junior,
hates him.


254
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.074
But he's gonna love me

255
00:12:01.141 --> 00:12:02.776
if I bring up
mixed martial arts.


256
00:12:02.877 --> 00:12:04.278
Do you have any idea how hard

257
00:12:04.378 --> 00:12:06.179
this molecular gastronomy stuff
is?


258
00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:08.782
I... I...
I really have to focus.
Okay, focus, babe.


259
00:12:08.883 --> 00:12:10.450
No more from me.
Thank you.


260
00:12:10.551 --> 00:12:11.953
I'll just study
the safety card.


261
00:12:12.619 --> 00:12:14.354
These people on here
look way too happy.


262
00:12:14.454 --> 00:12:15.924
Who'd be smiling
if this happened?


263
00:12:16.156 --> 00:12:17.825
Why are they so happy
going down the slide?


264
00:12:18.026 --> 00:12:19.259
Did you watch
the safety demonstration?


265
00:12:19.393 --> 00:12:21.562
I don't even know where
my raft is. Where's your raft?


266
00:12:21.863 --> 00:12:24.598
Babe, if we crash,
there's no swimming or rafting.


267
00:12:24.698 --> 00:12:26.901
There's nothing,
except maybe the black box.


268
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.403
Why would you say that?
Babe, come on, I gotta focus!


269
00:12:29.536 --> 00:12:33.106
Okay, but wow! Wow, wow!
That's not even funny.


270
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.108
Is that a pill?
GORDON: Yeah,
my father gave it to me.


271
00:12:35.309 --> 00:12:36.844
It's a relaxant.
He knows I'm not a great flyer.


272
00:12:36.978 --> 00:12:39.613
He said it'll take the edge off.
But you're drinking wine.


273
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.381
Baby I've had only three
and a half glasses.


274
00:12:41.481 --> 00:12:42.816
I'm not flying the damn thing.

275
00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:44.184
Ay, ay, ay.

276
00:12:48.322 --> 00:12:49.389
Wow!

277
00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.359
All right. Now, I can relax.

278

GORDON:


279
00:12:55.529 --> 00:12:57.031
(IN ENGLISH) I don't know,
Peter, what color the pill was.


280
00:12:57.097 --> 00:12:59.067
Yellow-ish?
It tasted yellow-ish.


281
00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:00.467
PETER: Hang on a second.

282
00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:02.369
Baby, I can't feel my face.

283
00:13:02.603 --> 00:13:04.304
Can you feel your face?
Check your face.

PETER: <i>Oh, shit, Sophie!</i>

285
00:13:05.606 --> 00:13:07.641
There's a fifty-fifty
I gave him a Quaalude


286
00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:08.609
instead of a Valium.

287
00:13:09.077 --> 00:13:11.846
A Quaalude?
PETER: <i>Listen, the '80s</i>
<i>were fucking bananas, man.</i>

Well, the '80s is happening

PETER: <i>Well, tell him</i>
<i>to have a good time.</i>

00:13:16.383 --> 00:13:17.784
It should wear off
in a couple hours.


291
00:13:17.919 --> 00:13:20.754
A couple of hours?
Do you know how much
I love this woman?


292
00:13:20.822 --> 00:13:22.356
I gotta go.
I love you!

You're shouting.

You're shouting.
Oh. my God.
Get it together, Gordon.

you're gonna break up with me.

I'm not gonna
break up with you, Gordon.

(IN ENGLISH) We'll get to
"whom." That's advanced.

00:40:20.975 --> 00:40:22.676
That's like, double

Okay, so in that example,

800
00:41:11.825 --> 00:41:14.228
"aren't" is a contraction
of "are" and "not."

"Aren't you a little old

it had more to do

with the mackerel
we were feeding it.


1354

was absolutely crushing it.
