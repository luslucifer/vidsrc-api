1
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.729
Go past me children.

2
00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.941
There are some to my left

3
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.151
and some ahead here.

4
00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:45.195
No.

5
00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:45.696
Yes.

6
00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:46.071
No.

7
00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:46.572
Yes.

8
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.659
Sleep child sleep.

9
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.912
Don't sit on me.

10
00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:54.121
I didn't sit on you.

11
00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:59.043
That's what happens when
you stamp on my foot.

12
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.109
You'd better not throw a
bucket of water over me.

13
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.735
No, we'd never do that.

14
00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:08.612
It better not make me late.

15
00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.118
This way... and out.

16
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.038
Watch out for the steps

17
00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:21.417
Feel for it... and down. Perfect

18
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:27.673
Last step, and now turn around

19
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.509
There you go. Wait. Stand here

20
00:08:33.888 --> 00:08:35.556
Surprise,

21
00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:37.683
Is this for me?

22
00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:38.642
Yes.

23
00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:40.394
Thank you.

24
00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.229
Happy birthday.

25
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.773
Where did you get it?

26
00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.108
I have my sources.

27
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.504
One, two, three passengers.

28
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:50.165
Who wants the first ride?

29
00:08:50.195 --> 00:08:51.010
Me.

30
00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:53.991
You.

31
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.617
You can have the first ride.

32
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:00.998
The paint is still fresh.

33
00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.751
Annagret will have a green bottom.

34
00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.232
Coals, bags, off to school.

35
00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.776
Thank you children.

36
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.488
Goodbye.

37
00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.208
Inge, pull your socks up.

38
00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.923
Bye-bye Daddy.

39
00:10:11.528 --> 00:10:12.903
Phlox.

40
00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.084
Would you like to smell a rose?

41
00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:31.255
Smell a rose. Yes. This one.

42
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.218
This one is beautiful.

43
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:50.399
Look, what a big dahlia.

44
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:57.364
And a ladybird. Yes.

45
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:32.417
Bronek.

46
00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:50.936
Marta.

47
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.401
Upstairs please.

48
00:12:57.402 --> 00:12:59.528
Then come and see me.

49
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.739
Sophie.

50
00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.119
Aniela, come.

51
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.173
Choose something you like.

52
00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:21.133
Only one each.

53
00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:22.509
Take something.

54
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.119
This one needs to be cleaned

55
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.205
and the lining has to be mended.

56
00:14:33.206 --> 00:14:34.456
Be careful with it.

57
00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:35.248
Of course.

58
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.000
Go back downstairs.

59
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.157
The bees are flying.

60
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:53.076
It is hot. isn't it?

61
00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:54.661
How was your journey?

62
00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:58.290
Long. But we're here now.

63
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.333
Yes indeed. So, not too bad?

64
00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:01.835
No, not too bad.

65
00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.421
Easier than last time actually.

66
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.755
Excellent. Well then, welcome back.

67
00:16:08.222 --> 00:16:10.295
Absolutely. We're glad to be here.

68
00:16:11.488 --> 00:16:13.190
Should we take our shoes off as well?

69
00:16:13.214 --> 00:16:14.150
No.

70
00:16:14.816 --> 00:16:17.216
Did you travel via Prague or Vienna?

71
00:16:17.923 --> 00:16:21.970
Prague. It is 56 minutes faster.

72
00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:50.050
She asked me where I got

73
00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.402
one of my jackets from.

74
00:16:51.426 --> 00:16:52.844
I said, "Canada."

75
00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.596
And she asked, "How
did you get to Canada?"

76
00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.349
She thought you meant the country?

77
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.225
Yes, of course.

78
00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:00.018
An understandable mistake.

79
00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.937
The same thing happened when Helga Pattisch

80
00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:03.146
came for the first time.

81
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:07.025
Out of all of the
clothes, she chose a dress

82
00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:11.112
that belonged to some little
Jewess half her size.


83
00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:14.407
I could only pull
the zipper up to here

84
00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:15.909
and the dress came apart.

85
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.119
And I pulled and pulled at it.

86
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.831
She just looked down at herself and said

87
00:17:21.832 --> 00:17:23.667
"I love this dress."

88
00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:25.544
In the end she took it

89
00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:28.505
And she said, "I'll go on a diet.”

90
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:33.885
Would you like more coffee?

91
00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:35.262
Yes please. Thank you.

92
00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:39.558
You take it black?

93
00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.934
Black is good, thank you.

94
00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:46.773
Helga's husband only adopted

95
00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:50.151
that little Polish boy
to keep her at home.

96
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.281
That's what she told me.

97
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.910
And he hits her as well.

98
00:17:58.911 --> 00:17:59.744
I didn't know that.

99
00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.204
How do you know that?

100
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:05.292
Haven't you noticed the bruises on her arms?

101
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.628
I forgot to tell you something.

102
00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:12.591
Guess where I found this diamond?

103
00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:14.843
In the toothpaste.

104
00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.428
No. Really?

105
00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:18.346
How clever you must to be.

106
00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:19.723
Yes, they are very clever.

107
00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.516
I've ordered more toothpaste

108
00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:22.809
because you never know.

109
00:18:41.412 --> 00:18:44.581
I think I told
you about the Schilling concert.

110
00:18:44.582 --> 00:18:47.334
About Brigitte Frank's ermine fur coat.

111
00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.419
Did I tell you about it?

112
00:18:49.765 --> 00:18:50.712
I don't think so.

113
00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:51.467
Look.

114
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.425
She looks like an empress.

115
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.845
The other side of
it is the next chamber

116
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:02.849
with the next load ready to burn

117
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.934
once the pieces here

118
00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:08.063
have been completely incinerated.

119
00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:09.356
How long does it take?

120
00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.776
7 hours, 400 to 500 at a time.

121
00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.235
Closer to 500.

122
00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:16.738
So, once that has happened,

123
00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:20.116
you close this chimney,

124
00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:22.494
then simultaneously open the next.

125
00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:25.372
The fire will follow the air,

126
00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:28.333
through this baffle of course,

127
00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:32.003
into this chamber and then burn this load.

128
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:37.550
The chamber directly opposite the combustion zone,

129
00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.887
which burns at roughly 1,000 degrees,

130
00:19:41.347 --> 00:19:48.436
has by now cooled to around 40 degrees.

131
00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:50.480
Cool enough to unload the ash

132
00:19:50.481 --> 00:19:52.691
and then reload the chamber.

133
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.984
So, this chamber is cooling

134
00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:56.569
while this one is heating up?

135
00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.658
Correct. The process moves one chamber over,

136
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.284
counterclockwise.

137
00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:08.623
So, burn, cool, unload, reload.

138
00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:10.083
And...

139
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:12.293
Continuously.

140
00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:25.557
Cheers.

141
00:20:28.655 --> 00:20:29.715
Dilla.

142
00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:35.024
Happy birthday, Commandant.

143
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:39.237
Happy birthday, Commandant.

144
00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.656
It is an honour to serve under you.

145
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:42.365
Thank you.

146
00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:44.868
Happy birthday, Commandant.

147
00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:45.827
Thank you.

148
00:20:46.412 --> 00:20:48.163
Happy birthday, Commandant.

149
00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:49.456
Thank you.

150
00:20:50.833 --> 00:20:52.459
That is a rifle.

151
00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.962
And this is also a rifle.

152
00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.674
And here is one with a pistol,

153
00:20:59.675 --> 00:21:01.885
and another rifle here.

154
00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:25.992
Do you hear that?

155
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:31.539
It's a bittern. A heron. 
A Eurasian grey heron.

156
00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.662
You cried like this too.

157
00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:13.081
You were even louder.

158
00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:16.960
What's going on with her?

159
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:18.378
She's strong, isn't she?

160
00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:22.924
I'd like to try mine now.

161
00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:35.455
What are you doing?

162
00:23:36.832 --> 00:23:38.041
What are you doing?

163
00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:38.958
I'm looking.

164
00:23:39.591 --> 00:23:40.710
At what?

165
00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:41.961
Teeth.

166
00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:51.137
What are you doing?

167
00:23:51.972 --> 00:23:53.056
Nothing.

168
00:26:15.282 --> 00:26:16.449
What are you doing here?

169
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:19.035
I'm handing out sugar.

170
00:26:19.995 --> 00:26:20.828
Who to?

171
00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:23.164
I'm looking.

172
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:28.127
Come.

173
00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:46.854
Then, a little white bird flew past

174
00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:50.316
to guide them out of the forest.

175
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:53.444
Soon they arrived at a huge lake.

176
00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:56.864
They were puzzled as they did
not know how to cross it.

177
00:26:57.783 --> 00:27:02.620
Suddenly, a bid beautiful
swan came swimming towards them.

178
00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:06.624
"Oh beautiful swan, please be our boat."

179
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:11.462
The swan bent its neck
and came to the shore.

180
00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:38.406
Bracht phoned the house.

181
00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:42.243
Yes, while you were outside for your toast.

182
00:27:42.536 --> 00:27:43.578
I forgot to tell you.

183
00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:45.746
He said he'd call back tomorrow, midday.

184
00:27:52.129 --> 00:27:53.045
Rudolf.

185
00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:59.093
Will you take me to
that spa in Italy again?

186
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:05.224
All that pampering.

187
00:28:06.894 --> 00:28:10.855
And the walks. 
And that nice couple we met.

188
00:28:17.154 --> 00:28:18.863
Is she wandering around again?

189
00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:20.031
No.

190
00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:23.409
And that man

191
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.538
who played the accordion to the cows?

192
00:28:28.582 --> 00:28:29.790
They loved it.

193
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.877
It was so funny.

194
00:28:33.962 --> 00:28:35.838
All looking at him like this.

195
00:28:44.264 --> 00:28:45.139
Will you?

196
00:28:45.933 --> 00:28:46.641
What?

197
00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:48.392
Well, take me back there.

198
00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:49.310
Yes.

199
00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:50.186
When?

200
00:28:52.189 --> 00:28:53.481
I don’t know when.

201
00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:01.614
You smell nice.

202
00:29:03.325 --> 00:29:04.617
It's French.

203
00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:19.298
Oink, oink.

204
00:29:34.064 --> 00:29:37.817
Chocolate. If you see it. Any goodies.

205
00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:21.319
To the head of the Party Chancellery

206
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.486
Reichsleiter Bormann.

207
00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:23.362
Personal.

208
00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:25.406
Dear Reichsleiter

209
00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:30.745
I learned that the commandant
of the gigantic K.L. Auschwitz

210
00:30:30.746 --> 00:30:32.246
Obersturmbannfuhrer Hoss

211
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:33.956
also well known to you,

212
00:30:33.957 --> 00:30:35.291
is to be transferred.

213
00:30:36.043 --> 00:30:38.669
Comdrade Hoss has made unprecedented achievements

214
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.421
over four years of painstaking work.

215
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:44.467
of this great camp close up

216
00:30:44.468 --> 00:30:46.135
so can attest.

217
00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.846
Reichsfuhrer Himmler himself acknowledges

218
00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:51.599
the uniqueness of what he built.

219
00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:55.144
Now it is said that the
task is too big for him

220
00:30:55.145 --> 00:30:57.980
and that someone must take his place.

221
00:30:58.815 --> 00:31:01.233
Hoss knows prisoner use inside out

222
00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:05.112
has close contacts with the Silesian armaments industry

223
00:31:05.364 --> 00:31:06.906
and has brought groundbreaking ideas

224
00:31:06.907 --> 00:31:08.449
to the whole field of KL practice.

225
00:31:08.784 --> 00:31:10.326
He is a model settler farmer

226
00:31:10.327 --> 00:31:12.661
and an exemplary German pioneer of the East.

227
00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:15.539
His particular strength is turning theory into practice.

228
00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:18.667
I will refrain from listing more qualities

229
00:31:18.668 --> 00:31:21.962
which prove a chance in
his command is not possible.

230
00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:24.465
Therefore, could you please speak

231
00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:26.050
to the Reichsfuhrer as soon as possible

232
00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:29.095
to prevent the transfer of Comrade Hoss.

233
00:31:29.805 --> 00:31:31.847
I would be very
grateful for a brief reply.

234
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:33.516
Heil Hitler.

235
00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:36.060
Gauleiter Fritz Bracht.

236
00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:41.524
Can I do it now?

237
00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:42.400
In a moment.

238
00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.821
Did you know that storks

239
00:31:46.822 --> 00:31:48.155
fly as far as Africa?

240
00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:51.242
How far do you think they fly?

241
00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:52.910
How many kilometres?

242
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:53.828
300?

243
00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:55.413
More.

244
00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:13.305
All these weeds here.

245
00:32:16.435 --> 00:32:18.544
You are what you say.

246
00:32:18.851 --> 00:32:20.271
You are what you say.

247
00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:21.730
Cows find this funny.

248
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:23.816
The whole farm is roaring,
because you are so boring.

249
00:32:24.398 --> 00:32:25.432
Cows find this funny.

250
00:32:25.527 --> 00:32:27.778
The whole farm is roaring,
because you are so boring.

251
00:32:28.071 --> 00:32:29.780
No, you're boring.

252
00:33:46.775 --> 00:33:47.608
All is well.

253
00:33:49.194 --> 00:33:50.569
I hate you.

254
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.197
Keep your eyes closed, or it'll hurt.

255
00:33:53.198 --> 00:33:54.073
I know.

256
00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:57.409
Once more. All good. Come here.

257
00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:29.066
We have to rinse your eyes.

258
00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.818
Everything's fine. You'll live.

259
00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:43.414
...with which 60,000 Italian spectators

260
00:34:43.415 --> 00:34:46.166
showered their victorious national team.

261
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:49.712
We will be able
to share in their delight.

262
00:34:50.547 --> 00:34:52.631
How long it's been since Milan saw

263
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:54.883
their beloved Squadra Azzurra?

264
00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:58.053
And now they have
returned with a 4-0 victory

265
00:34:58.054 --> 00:35:00.848
to the arena of their many triumphs.

266
00:35:01.433 --> 00:35:04.476
Can you imagine the celebration?

267
00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:07.438
4-0 against their old rivals Spain,

268
00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:10.566
who are again aspiring
to a position of power

269
00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:12.318
in European football,

270
00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:15.571
as we Germans saw with our own eyes

271
00:35:15.572 --> 00:35:17.156
in Berlin last Sunday.

272
00:35:17.741 --> 00:35:20.534
But don't let the result fool you.

273
00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:22.995
4-0 was the final score.

274
00:35:22.996 --> 00:35:24.538
But at half time

275
00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:28.542
this thrilling Italian
-Spanish encounter

276
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:29.835
stood at 0-0.

277
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.128
Hang up.

278
00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:37.301
Fritz.

279
00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:40.137
Go on.

280
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.725
What does it say?

281
00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:56.278
Well.

282
00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:00.699
No, you wrote a very
powerful letter on my behalf.

283
00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.493
Their minds were obviously made up.

284
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:06.038
I'd better tell my wife.

285
00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:11.293
She might.

286
00:36:12.504 --> 00:36:14.630
The train stopped for ages at Krakow.

287
00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:15.297
How frustrating.

288
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.218
And it was so hot.

289
00:36:19.761 --> 00:36:23.097
A lady fainted next to
me, it was that hot.

290
00:36:23.807 --> 00:36:25.683
She's moving here with her husband,

291
00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:28.143
who's an engineer. 
He's a lot older.

292
00:36:28.144 --> 00:36:29.019
Yes.

293
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.188
They’ve both got jobs at a new factory.

294
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.147
Siemens.

295
00:36:32.148 --> 00:36:33.899
Ah, yes. That's possible.

296
00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:39.655
All the big companies are here, he said.

297
00:36:39.656 --> 00:36:40.989
Yes, yes.

298
00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:45.369
Don’t you need to get on?

299
00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:46.912
Yes. I'd better.

300
00:36:46.913 --> 00:36:48.497
I'll show Mum to the girls' room.

301
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:53.794
Are you ready?

302
00:36:54.963 --> 00:36:56.714
You’ll have Heideraud’s bed

303
00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:58.632
and she'll get in with Inge
-Brigitt.

304
00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:00.050
You don't mind, do you?

305
00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:00.968
Of course not.

306
00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:03.887
The house looks big, but it actually isn't.

307
00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:05.597
The first thing we did

308
00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:08.183
was install central heating.

309
00:37:08.184 --> 00:37:12.271
It gets so cold in winter.

310
00:37:12.272 --> 00:37:13.731
You wouldn’t believe it.

311
00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:29.872
Hand-painted.

312
00:37:29.873 --> 00:37:30.456
Really?

313
00:37:30.457 --> 00:37:31.331
Yes.

314
00:37:41.468 --> 00:37:43.635
This is Heideraud's bed here.

315
00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:46.597
This is lovely.

316
00:37:47.307 --> 00:37:47.890
Truly.

317
00:37:50.393 --> 00:37:52.352
Such a lovely room.

318
00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:56.607
The top two drawers are for you.

319
00:37:56.858 --> 00:37:58.859
Yes, that's more than enough.

320
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:01.153
Such beautiful flowers.

321
00:38:10.705 --> 00:38:12.039
Yes, try it.

322
00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:13.916
But I'm sleeping here?

323
00:38:13.917 --> 00:38:16.210
Yes, but they're both...

324
00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:18.420
...the same.

325
00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:27.095
My girl.

326
00:38:27.368 --> 00:38:29.348
That's spinach strudel, apple strudel,

327
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:30.641
potato salad.

328
00:38:31.184 --> 00:38:32.935
And your cinnamon rolls.

329
00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:34.561
My recipe?

330
00:38:41.361 --> 00:38:42.569
Very nice.

331
00:38:43.112 --> 00:38:43.779
My god.

332
00:38:45.365 --> 00:38:46.073
Subject:

333
00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:46.907
Subject:

334
00:38:46.908 --> 00:38:50.035
Lilac bushes by the commandant's guard barr

335
00:38:53.957 --> 00:38:56.959
From now on, SS members who pick lilacs

336
00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:04.591
in a thoughtless and blatant manner

337
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.053
so that the bushes bleed

338
00:39:09.097 --> 00:39:11.014
will be punished.

339
00:39:13.643 --> 00:39:15.185
I expect the SS members,

340
00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:17.938
if they wish to take some,

341
00:39:19.774 --> 00:39:21.316
to' do it in a way

342
00:39:21.317 --> 00:39:23.068
that does not damage the bushes.

343
00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:28.574
In the interest of our whole community,

344
00:39:28.575 --> 00:39:30.200
I hope you understand

345
00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:33.161
that the lilac bushes

346
00:39:33.997 --> 00:39:35.956
are intended to decorate our entire camp

347
00:39:36.249 --> 00:39:39.376
both now and in the future.

348
00:39:42.422 --> 00:39:44.423
Jews in the house?

349
00:39:45.315 --> 00:39:47.402
The Jews are over the
other side of the wall.

350
00:39:47.886 --> 00:39:49.177
They’re local girls.

351
00:39:49.908 --> 00:39:51.268
Say hello to grandma.

352
00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:55.267
Hello.

353
00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:00.480
My God.

354
00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:05.444
He's got so big, and
you have such nice hair.

355
00:40:07.322 --> 00:40:09.531
I think it's your turn
to push, isn't it Hans?

356
00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:10.949
Inge pushed you before

357
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.284
and now it's your turn. Go on.

358
00:40:12.994 --> 00:40:13.994
Let's go.

359
00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:21.960
This is all us.

360
00:40:23.212 --> 00:40:24.546
There's a grape vine.

361
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.007
Obviously, it'll grow.

362
00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:39.229
It's huge.

363
00:40:40.188 --> 00:40:41.813
I'm speechless.

364
00:40:43.483 --> 00:40:45.567
It's all my design.

365
00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:47.069
All the planting and everything.

366
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.906
The greenhouse, the gazebo at the end.

367
00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:52.115
Is that a pool?

368
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:52.950
Yes..

369
00:40:53.326 --> 00:40:55.702
I have gardeners. 
I couldn't do it alone.

370
00:40:55.703 --> 00:40:56.620
With a slide?

371
00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.080
Oh Heddy.

372
00:41:00.333 --> 00:41:01.458
Do you like it?

373
00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:04.962
Of course I like it. 
How could I not?

374
00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:10.342
This was a field three years ago.

375
00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:12.761
No.

376
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:17.557
We just had the
lower garden by the street.

377
00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:19.559
And the house had a flat roof.

378
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.728
It's hard to believe.

379
00:41:24.273 --> 00:41:26.566
And that's the camp wall?

380
00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:28.235
Yes, that's the camp wall.

381
00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:30.779
We planted more vines at the back

382
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.698
to grow and cover it.

383
00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:35.283
Maybe Esther Silberman is over there.

384
00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:36.243
Which one was she?

385
00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:37.744
The one I used to clean for.

386
00:41:38.663 --> 00:41:40.998
She was the one
who had the book readings.

387
00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:43.834
God knows what they were up to.

388
00:41:44.127 --> 00:41:45.335
Bolshevik stuff.

389
00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:46.712
Jewish stuff.

390
00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:51.341
And I got outbid on her curtains

391
00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:53.510
at the street auction.

392
00:41:53.803 --> 00:41:55.262
Her opposite, she got them.

393
00:41:55.847 --> 00:41:57.681
I loved those curtains.

394
00:41:59.851 --> 00:42:02.352
These flowers are so beautiful.

395
00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:04.312
The azaleas there.

396
00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:06.481
There are also vegetables.

397
00:42:07.275 --> 00:42:12.362
A few herbs. Rosemary. Beetroot. 
This is fennel.

398
00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:14.609
Sunflowers.

399
00:42:18.661 --> 00:42:23.457
And here is kohlrabi. 
The children love to eat it

400
00:42:23.875 --> 00:42:28.295
Cabbage. Kale. Runner beans.

401
00:42:29.464 --> 00:42:30.505
Pumpkins.

402
00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:32.716
Potatoes and more.

403
00:42:39.265 --> 00:42:43.185
We have bees over
here to provide our honey.

404
00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:45.312
It's a paradise garden.

405
00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:48.732
And Rudolf is okay?

406
00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:50.484
Yes, he's fine.

407
00:42:50.777 --> 00:42:53.779
Working non-stop, even when he's home.

408
00:42:55.031 --> 00:42:56.448
Which he loves.

409
00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:59.284
He's a busy bee.

410
00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:01.244
He is. Non-stop.

411
00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:04.206
And under pressure like you wouldn't believe.

412
00:43:07.168 --> 00:43:08.585
And you're okay?

413
00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:12.047
Do I look okay?

414
00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:22.808
Rudi calls me the Queen of Auschwitz.

415
00:43:33.027 --> 00:43:34.069
Honestly.

416
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.655
To have all this.

417
00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:43.870
You really have landed
on your feet, my child.

418
00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:49.751
The linden trees are turning yellow.

419
00:43:51.129 --> 00:43:53.630
It smelled so nice when they were flowering.

420
00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:00.178
This will grow and cover everything.

421
00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:03.515
You'll see next time you visit.

422
00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:09.104
No.

423
00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:13.650
Stop it.

424
00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:29.226
The heartfelt time we
spent in the Hoss house

425
00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:33.521
will always be

426
00:45:33.522 --> 00:45:38.235
among our most beautiful holiday memories.

427
00:45:38.236 --> 00:45:40.654
In the East lies our tomorrow.

428
00:45:41.364 --> 00:45:46.618
Thanks for your National Socialist hospitality.

429
00:45:47.828 --> 00:45:52.415
And this was from... Willy... Billy...

430
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.368
Hans says you have his sandals.

431
00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:16.166
We have to leave, Mutzi.

432
00:47:18.169 --> 00:47:19.210
Leave where?

433
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.922
Here. We have to go. 
We're being transferred.

434
00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:25.633
Sorry, what?

435
00:47:25.634 --> 00:47:27.052
We're being transferred.

436
00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:30.055
To where?

437
00:47:30.056 --> 00:47:31.431
Oranienburg.

438
00:47:32.892 --> 00:47:33.808
What?

439
00:47:34.352 --> 00:47:36.353
They're swapping me for Arthur Liebehenschel.

440
00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:37.562
He comes here.

441
00:47:38.898 --> 00:47:40.732
I take over as Deputy Inspector.

442
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:50.617
If you've known this for
a while, why tell me now?

443
00:47:51.786 --> 00:47:53.286
There was no good moment to say it.

444
00:47:53.287 --> 00:47:54.579
You've said it now.

445
00:47:55.456 --> 00:47:56.206
Where are you going?

446
00:47:56.207 --> 00:47:57.248
To get the sandals.

447
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.504
When did you find out?

448
00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:04.172
Pohl told me last week.

449
00:48:04.173 --> 00:48:05.715
I tried to make it go away.

450
00:48:12.098 --> 00:48:13.848
Then call Bormann.

451
00:48:14.266 --> 00:48:16.059
I've tried Bormann.

452
00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:17.519
Should I go to Hitler now?

453
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.436
Well, yes.

454
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.065
Rudolf.

455
00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:29.906
Rudolf.

456
00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.619
Don't turn your back on me.

457
00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:37.789
Stop.

458
00:48:37.957 --> 00:48:39.958
Calm down. Go back to the party.

459
00:48:43.003 --> 00:48:45.004
You can't do this to me.

460
00:48:50.803 --> 00:48:52.345
What is this? Marta.

461
00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:55.598
Mrs Hoss?

462
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.392
What's this, "Mrs Hoss? Mrs Hoss?"

463
00:48:57.393 --> 00:48:58.518
I'll show you Mrs Hoss.

464
00:48:58.519 --> 00:48:59.561
Mop it up.

465
00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:02.105
Don't forget you live well in our house.

466
00:49:02.106 --> 00:49:03.148
Bloody hell.

467
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:05.859
Now.

468
00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:15.493
Bloody hell.

469
00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:16.137
Why are they transferring you?

470
00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:19.307
Structural changes.

471
00:50:19.558 --> 00:50:20.600
What does that mean?

472
00:50:21.268 --> 00:50:22.727
They weren't specific.

473
00:50:22.728 --> 00:50:24.062
But I’m not the only one being moved.

474
00:50:24.522 --> 00:50:26.064
There are lots of us.

475
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.860
When?

476
00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:31.694
Soon.

477
00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:32.904
How soon?

478
00:50:32.905 --> 00:50:34.781
I'm waiting to be told.

479
00:50:42.623 --> 00:50:45.708
If it's about the
investigation they should call Himmler.

480
00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:46.918
He encouraged us.

481
00:50:46.942 --> 00:50:47.703
No.

482
00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:50.505
So it's not that?

483
00:50:50.506 --> 00:50:52.298
It's a political matter.

484
00:50:53.968 --> 00:50:54.968
Then go to Hitler.

485
00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:56.010
Don't be ridiculous.

486
00:50:56.011 --> 00:50:57.095
It's not ridiculous.

487
00:50:57.096 --> 00:50:59.681
You're the one who carries out his orders

488
00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:01.266
once you peel away the layers.

489
00:51:01.267 --> 00:51:04.686
We have to face facts. 
We have to leave.

490
00:51:05.646 --> 00:51:06.396
No.

491
00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:08.314
You have to leave.

492
00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:12.986
Yes.

493
00:51:14.822 --> 00:51:16.990
Your work is in Oranienburg now.

494
00:51:16.991 --> 00:51:20.034
Mine is raising our children,

495
00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:21.244
and I'll do that from here.

496
00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:29.586
I never thought that
you wouldn't be with me.

497
00:51:31.422 --> 00:51:32.755
Never crossed my mind.

498
00:51:33.591 --> 00:51:36.467
They’d have to drag me out of here.

499
00:51:37.511 --> 00:51:39.137
You know that.

500
00:51:43.392 --> 00:51:45.184
This is our home.

501
00:51:49.273 --> 00:51:52.025
We're living how we dreamed we would.

502
00:51:52.026 --> 00:51:55.069
Since we were 17. 
Beyond how we dreamed.

503
00:51:57.156 --> 00:51:58.865
Out of the city finally.

504
00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:01.451
Everything we want. 
On our doorstep.

505
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.829
And our children are strong, healthy and happy.

506
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.626
Everything the Fuhrer said

507
00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:11.461
about how to live is how we do.

508
00:52:11.462 --> 00:52:13.212
Go East. Living space.

509
00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:16.215
This is our living space.

510
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.229
I know you agree with me.

511
00:52:34.318 --> 00:52:36.277
Arthur can find somewhere else to live.

512
00:52:36.278 --> 00:52:37.945
He doesn't need to take our home.

513
00:52:37.946 --> 00:52:39.614
You should make it a condition.

514
00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:41.199
It's the least they can do.

515
00:52:43.577 --> 00:52:46.996
He'll want a townhouse, anyway.

516
00:52:51.251 --> 00:52:52.585
Rudolf?

517
00:52:55.464 --> 00:52:56.673
I heard you.

518
00:52:58.384 --> 00:52:59.300
So?

519
00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:01.219
I'll ask.

520
00:53:13.899 --> 00:53:15.858
You'll be working all the time.

521
00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:16.442
Yes.

522
00:53:17.653 --> 00:53:19.278
We'd never see you.

523
00:53:19.279 --> 00:53:19.904
No.

524
00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:32.834
I'll miss you, of course.

525
00:53:32.835 --> 00:53:34.836
But you'll come home when you can.

526
00:53:42.803 --> 00:53:44.345
I'll be...

527
00:53:45.389 --> 00:53:48.641
with you. Just like you'll be with me.

528
00:54:02.114 --> 00:54:02.905
Yes?

529
00:54:15.377 --> 00:54:16.961
And after the war

530
00:54:19.047 --> 00:54:21.257
when everything is over, we'll farm.

531
00:54:21.258 --> 00:54:22.925
Like we said.

532
00:55:02.674 --> 00:55:04.342
Do you all understand?

533
00:55:04.343 --> 00:55:05.551
Yes.

534
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:12.600
So, I'll be missing your birthday.

535
00:55:16.271 --> 00:55:18.564
And maybe even our anniversary.

536
00:55:19.066 --> 00:55:21.108
Depending on how long I'll be gone.

537
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:24.403
So, those are some of the things

538
00:55:24.404 --> 00:55:25.988
that definitely add to the struggle.

539
00:55:28.659 --> 00:55:30.326
But the life we enjoy

540
00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:33.579
is very much worth the sacrifice.

541
00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:38.668
It's time for bed.

542
00:55:42.381 --> 00:55:44.507
Hans, your plate.

543
00:55:49.847 --> 00:55:50.805
Be calm.

544
00:57:44.962 --> 00:57:46.837
It'll be hard for you too.

545
00:57:48.632 --> 00:57:49.757
I know that.

546
00:57:51.218 --> 00:57:52.718
Don't you think I know that?

547
00:57:53.011 --> 00:57:54.053
I know that.

548
00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:58.975
I love you.

549
00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:05.940
I love you, my beauty.

550
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:22.039
Call Walter Durrfeld first thing and see
if he can join us at selection.

551
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.458
Tell him they're Dutch

552
00:58:24.459 --> 00:58:26.252
and he can have his pick.

553
00:58:27.254 --> 00:58:29.588
Otherwise, I'll see him at the IG lunch.

554
00:58:31.717 --> 00:58:33.926
Letter to Messrs. 
Prufer and Sander,

555
00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:34.969
Topf and Sons.

556
00:58:36.096 --> 00:58:38.055
Subject: New Crematorium.

557
00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:42.601
I'am glad you were able
to make the journey last week.

558
00:58:44.855 --> 00:58:48.107
SS
-Obersturmbannfuhrer Bischoff and I both agree

559
00:58:48.108 --> 00:58:51.652
the ring crematorioum is definitely the answer.

560
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.947
What a difference it will make.

561
00:58:55.282 --> 00:58:56.240
Bravo.

562
00:58:58.994 --> 00:59:00.453
I welcome your...

563
00:59:01.288 --> 00:59:02.955
I welcome your suggestion

564
00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:05.541
that the design should be patented

565
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:07.960
in order to secure priority.

566
00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:09.962
I will follow up
with a letter of intent.

567
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:13.632
You should be aware,

568
00:59:13.633 --> 00:59:15.301
I've been promoted to Deputy Inspector

569
00:59:15.302 --> 00:59:18.554
of concentration camps at the IKL.

570
00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:19.597
Come.

571
00:59:23.685 --> 00:59:26.395
And therefore, future communications

572
00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:28.522
will be from Oranienburg
-Berlin.

573
00:59:30.609 --> 00:59:33.152
The focus there is now on labour.

574
00:59:37.657 --> 00:59:40.785
Of course, this direction will affect our plans

575
00:59:43.997 --> 00:59:46.624
and though it pains me to leave Auschwitz

576
00:59:47.709 --> 00:59:51.670
I believe I'll be in a better position

577
00:59:52.756 --> 00:59:54.965
to push for funds and materials

578
00:59:55.926 --> 00:59:56.926
from there.

579
00:59:58.053 --> 00:59:59.178
Heil Hitler. Et cetera.

580
01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:31.460
Letter to Gruppenfuhrer Glucks, IKL.

581
01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:34.505
Subject: Transfer.

582
01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.425
Dear Gruppenfuhrer Glucks,

583
01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:43.514
I would like my family to remain

584
01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:47.017
at 88 Bielitzstrasse, KL Auschwitz

585
01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.978
for the duration of my transfer.

586
01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.189
It would be a great favour to me

587
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:53.941
for this to be permitted.

588
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.987
I must stress what a wonderful environment

589
01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:02.533
Hedwig is making for
the children since settling here.

590
01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:06.453
An inspiration in many ways

591
01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:09.498
for our new German community in the East.

592
01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.793
If this is acceptable,

593
01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:15.087
provision of a simple lodging for myself

594
01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.589
in Oranienburg will suffice.

595
01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:21.343
I would be very
grateful for a speedy answer.

596
01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:22.720
Heil Hitler, et cetera.

597
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.809
Sweaty.

598
01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.917
The little snow white
bird flew down and sang,

599
01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:21.630
"Be warned, be warned."

600
01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:32.266
Gretel understood what the witch had in mind

601
01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:36.270
and said, "Please show me first,

602
01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:38.355
I don't know how to do that."

603
01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:43.360
The witch sat on the shovel

604
01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:45.654
and Gretel pushed her into the oven,

605
01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:48.907
as deep as she could.

606
01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:56.290
Then she closed the
iron door of the oven.

607
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.250
And secured it with a bar.

608
01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:01.920
The witch got cooked alive

609
01:04:02.922 --> 01:04:06.633
as a punishment for her horrible deeds.

610
01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:10.137
Gretel ran straight to Hansel,

611
01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:15.351
unlocked the goose cage and let him out.

612
01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.145
He jumped out

613
01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:20.356
and threw his arms around his sister's neck.

614
01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:22.900
They kissed one another,

615
01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:25.110
cried with joy, and thanked God.

616
01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:27.946
The little white bird sang,

617
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:32.701
"Pearls and gems for bread crumbs."

618
01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.593
Here you are at last.

619
01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:11.044
Words by Joseph Wulf.

620
01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:13.171
Written in 1943

621
01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:15.591
in Oswiecim, Auschwitz III.

622
01:08:30.354 --> 01:08:34.879
<i>Sunbeams</i>

623
01:08:40.272 --> 01:08:45.585
<i>radiant and warm</i>

624

<i>Human bodies</i>

<i>And we</i>

627
01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:13.523
<i>who are imprisoned here</i>

628
01:09:14.525 --> 01:09:16.943
<i>Our hearts</i>

629
01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:22.949
<i>are not yet cold</i>

630
01:09:24.213 --> 01:09:29.800

01:09:30.572 --> 01:09:36.702

632

<i>Tearing, breaking</i>

633
01:09:40.991 --> 01:09:45.820
<i>through their pain</i>

634
01:09:47.097 --> 01:09:52.254
<i>For soon we'll see</i>

635
01:09:53.241 --> 01:09:58.248
<i>that waving flag</i>

636
01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:04.950
<i>The flag of freedom</i>

637
01:10:04.974 --> 01:10:13.772
<i>yet to come.</i>

638
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.929
Don't forget to stand straight.

639
01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.355
I've packed buttered bread for you all.

640
01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:39.693
Come on children. Hurry.

641
01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:56.793
Sophie.

642
01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.474
Tell her it's getting cold.

643
01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:11.516
She's not here.

644
01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:12.642
What?

645
01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:14.227
She's gone.

646
01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.188
What, not upstairs?

647
01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:17.647
No, she's gone.

648
01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:19.274
And her case has gone.

649
01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:21.651
That cannot be.

650
01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:25.405
Mum?

651
01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.293
Go and look for her.

652
01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.270
Aniela.

653
01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:40.272
Take it away.

654
01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:44.234
Was that here to spite me?

655
01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:48.363
No, Mrs. Hoss.

656
01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.670
I could have my husband spread your ashes

657
01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:05.839
across the fields of Babice.

658
01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:33.909
Relax, let her find it.

659
01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:39.956
Are you not going
to be a commandant anymore?

660
01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:44.669
I’ll be head of all commandants.

661
01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:49.799
Inspecting their camps,
seeing where improvements can be made.


662
01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:53.845
Their yield, that kind of thing.

663
01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.809
It has a great name.

664
01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:03.188
It's girl's eye, or tickseed.

665
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:04.064
Girl's eye?

666
01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.650
Girl's eye, yes.

667
01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:08.318
I can only guess

668
01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:11.947
that's because of its serrated petals,

669
01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:15.909
because they resemble the long eyelashes

670
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:20.288
of women and girls.

You there.

674
01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:10.940
Guard.

675
01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.155
Bring him here.

676
01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:25.330
What's he done?

677
01:16:25.706 --> 01:16:28.374
Fighting over an apple, Commandant.

678
01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:30.335
Drown him in the river.

679
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:32.212
Come.

680
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:47.102
Don't do that again.

681
01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:53.108
Move it.

682
01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:55.819
I don't care.

683
01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:56.736
Move it.

684
01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:57.821
Get it out.

685
01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:08.915
Are you going to stand there trembling?

686
01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:12.710
Something to say?

687
01:17:17.424 --> 01:17:18.299
Come.

688
01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:59.132
Aren't you lovely?

689
01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:01.384
Yes, you are lovely.

690
01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:02.844
Male or female?

691
01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:03.553
Male.

692
01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:04.512
How old?

693
01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:05.221
4 years old.

694
01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:06.514
What's his name?

695
01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:07.098
Torin.

696
01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:12.145
You don't see many with his colouring.

697
01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:14.272
No, mostly black or salt and pepper.

698
01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:18.902
I had a black one
when I was little. Elsa.

699
01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:20.236
Born on the same day I was.

700
01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:21.696
He's lovely.

701
01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:22.322
Thank you.

702
01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:23.865
Come on.

raise money for War Winter Relief.

705

706
01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:35.168

Sauer, Riga
-Kaiserwald.

733
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.126
The Fuhrer has approved the deportation

734
01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:19.545
of Hungary's 700,000 Jews for extermination

735
01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:22.548
and war production where able-bodied.

736
01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.468
An agreement was reached

737
01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.095
with the new Hungarian government

738
01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:29.597
to begin the operation immediately.

739
01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:31.391
They are being amassed

740
01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:33.643
for transportation to Auschwitz.

741
01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:35.937
4 trains a day, 3,000 on each.

742
01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.689
12,000 daily.

743
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.149
Firstly via the Eastern zones, 1 to 3.

744
01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:41.776
Then via 4 and 5

745
01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:43.695
in the middle of the country,

746
01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:44.904
and finally, Budapest.

747
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:48.366
Pressburg and Vienna are heavily loaded

748
01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:49.951
with military transports.

749
01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:52.203
Jewish transports will pass through

750
01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:54.205
Kassa and Muszyna instead.

751
01:19:55.165 --> 01:19:58.001
Based on estimates provided by Obersturmbannfuhrer Hoss,

752
01:19:58.002 --> 01:20:01.212
25% will be retained for labour after selection.

753
01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.131
20% of those will be utilized

754
01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.258
in Auschwitz sub-camps,

755
01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:07.093
and the other 80%

756
01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:09.470
will come to your camps in due course.

757
01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:13.474
The scale is many times larger than before.

758
01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.101
So prepare yourselves.

759
01:20:15.602 --> 01:20:18.062
Before I hand over to Obersturmbannfuhrer Hoss,

760
01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:20.231
I'd like to announce

761
01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:21.607
the promotion of Colonel Maurer

762
01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:23.192
to the rank of SS
-Standartenfuhrer

763
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.487
for consistently hitting his labour targets.

764
01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:27.280
Bravo.

765
01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:32.869
I get fan mail
from CEOs for this man.

766
01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.329
More famous than me.

767
01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.163
Thank you, sir.

768
01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:36.622
Well deserved.

769
01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:37.707
As I've said before,

770
01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:39.500
I'm grateful for your leadership.

771
01:20:39.752 --> 01:20:42.503
Thank you. You have said that.
I appreciate that.


772
01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:44.630
Thank you, Obergruppenfuhrer Pohl.

773
01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:45.506
Good morning, everyone.

774
01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:46.466
Good morning.

775
01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:48.551

-Kaiserwald.

778
01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:55.683
You will appreciate

779
01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.685
we have a very busy agenda today.

780
01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:00.772
The Hungarian operation is urgent,

781
01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.106
and complex,

782
01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:04.400
and will involve converging challenges

783
01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:06.778
at every operational level.

784
01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.239
Please turn to the
first page in your files.

785
01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:13.534
You will see five headings.

786
01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:15.078
Item one.

787
01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:16.329

Dr. Meindl from Steyr
-Daimler

794
01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:29.008
some of you know
him, some of you don't,

795
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.135

The girls didn't want to go out.

800
01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:43.833
Yes.

801
01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:47.336
Because it is so cold.

802
01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:50.673
Well, I love the show.

803
01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:05.104
Stop.

804
01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:08.024
Leave me alone, Claus.

805
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:20.495
Stop it, Claus.

806
01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:25.750
No.

807
01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.087
Leave me alone, you traitor.

808
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:44.101
Saturday’s funeral ceremony for the pupils

809
01:23:44.102 --> 01:23:45.561
of the Air Force School

810
01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.355
who died in the bombing raid

811
01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.148

813
01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:55.404
in the forecourt of
the T Building by 10.45.

814
01:23:56.114 --> 01:23:58.115
Transport will leave for Hans Schemm School

815
01:23:58.116 --> 01:23:59.450

816

819
01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:11.420
with a delegation from
the League of German Girls

820
01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.839
and Air Force Students.

821
01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:21.305
Obersturmbannfuhrer Hoss.

822
01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:25.601
Rudolf. Come on in.

823
01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:26.978
How are you?

824
01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:28.229
Good.

825
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:31.440
I've just received this.

826
01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:33.693
Obergruppenfuhrer Pohl met with

827
01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:35.111
Reichsfuhrer Himmler

828
01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:37.530
to assess the numbers involved

829
01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:41.367
and your name came up.

830
01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.630
We're moving Liebehenschel to Majdanek.

831
01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:57.425
He's not energetic enough for this.

832
01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:58.259
Okay.

833
01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.970
You'll receive oprational orders from Eichmann.

834
01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:02.096
Perfect.

835
01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:05.016
Tell me what resources you
need when you get there.

836
01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:05.933
I will.

837
01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:10.563
Any problems, come to me or Gerhard directly.

838
01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:14.692
Thank you.

839
01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:16.777
How's Hedwig?

840
01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:17.820
Good.

841
01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:20.114
Pohl told me she sends the boss

842
01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.033
flowers from your garden every week.

843
01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:22.617
Yes.

844
01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:25.244
Get the job done.

845
01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:26.746
I will. Thank you.

846
01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:28.664
I appreciate the trust and confidence

847
01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:29.457
you have in me.

848
01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:41.510
And?

849
01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:45.598
I'm not sure yet.

850
01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:48.059
Relax.

851
01:25:49.019 --> 01:25:51.103
He won't put them all up the chimney.

852
01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:54.899
You'll get your workers.

853
01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:56.859
You'll see.

854
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:11.123
Are you sleeping okay?

855
01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:11.749
Yes.

856
01:26:14.455 --> 01:26:16.455
How many bowel movements
do you have per day?

857
01:26:17.222 --> 01:26:18.342
Twice per day.

858
01:26:19.362 --> 01:26:20.409
Urinating?

859
01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:22.259
Without issues.

860
01:26:24.054 --> 01:26:27.306
I'll feel around now. 
On the surface, first.

861
01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:30.935
If there is any pain,
then please let me know.

862
01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:45.449
This is Hoss.

863
01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:46.283
Long-distance priority call,

864
01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:48.494
KL Auschwitz, Hoss private residence.

865
01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:50.204
I'll stay on the line.

866
01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:06.971
Are you there?

867
01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:08.681
Hello?

868
01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:09.765
Can you talk?

869
01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:12.852
Is everything okay?

870
01:27:12.853 --> 01:27:13.477
Yes.

871
01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:14.603
I have news.

872
01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:16.313
I told you I'd heard rumblings

873
01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:17.523
but nothing concrete.

874
01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:20.025
What news?

875
01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.110
The Hungary thing.

876
01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:23.487
The old man gave me orders from Heinrich.

877
01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:26.407
It's happening at last. 
I'm coming back to run it.

878
01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.951
Well, I'm very relieved about that.

879
01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:35.332
I have to admit, 
I'm pleased as Punch.

880
01:27:38.295 --> 01:27:38.794
Yes.

881
01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:43.466
I don't know, I go to Budapest first.

882
01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:44.842
Things will be clearer after that.

883
01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:47.052
Anyway, my cogs are turning.

884
01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:48.137
I must get on.

885
01:27:48.138 --> 01:27:48.596
I'll call you later, after the party.

886
01:27:48.597 --> 01:27:49.805
I'll call you later, after the party

887
01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.348
No. Wait, please.

888
01:27:51.349 --> 01:27:52.767
Tell Eleanor Pohl,

889
01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:55.144
when she receives her parcel,

890
01:27:55.145 --> 01:27:56.562
to look in the compact.

891
01:27:56.563 --> 01:27:57.521
They're inside.

892
01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.808
I heard Himmler's calling it Operation Hoss.

893
01:31:21.059 --> 01:31:23.018
That's fantastic. 
I'm so happy for you.

894
01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:24.395
Thank you, Mutzi.

895
01:31:24.688 --> 01:31:25.813
It's your name too.

896
01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:27.773
Who was there?

897
01:31:28.566 --> 01:31:29.566
To tell you the truth

898
01:31:30.068 --> 01:31:32.194
I wasn't really paying attention.

899
01:31:32.904 --> 01:31:34.154
I was too busy thinking

900
01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:36.198
how I'd gas everyone in the room.

901
01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:38.742
Very difficult, logistically,

902
01:31:39.035 --> 01:31:40.452
because of its high ceiling.

903
01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:45.124
It's the middle of the night

904
01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:47.543
and I need to be in bed.

905
01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:50.004
I shouldn't have called so late.

906
01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:52.548
I was just excited
to tell you the name.

907
01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:56.593
You can tell me about
it when you get back.

908
01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:06.437
You have told them Daddy's coming home?

909
01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:08.939
Yes.

910
01:32:09.441 --> 01:32:10.315
Goodnight.

911
