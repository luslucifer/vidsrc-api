00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.375
JUNE 6, 1944

2
00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:51.375
THE NORMANDY INVASION

3
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.958
AFTER 2 MONTHS OF HEAVY FIGHTING

4
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:06.916
THE GERMANS HASTILY RETREAT.

5
00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:11.250
THE ALLIES DESPERATELY
NEED TO CAPTURE A PORT


6
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:16.500
TO GET SUPPLIES TO THEIR TROOPS.

7
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.750
BELGIUM

8
00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:21.375
BRUSSELS

9
00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.208
ANTWERP

10
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:30.250
ANTWERP IS LIBERATED
AND THE PORT IS INTACT.


11
00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.666
THE SCHELDT RIVER

12
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.250
BUT ANTWERP CANNOT BE REACHED

13
00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:43.250
AS THE GERMANS HOLD THE SCHELDT.

14
00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:51.458
PART OF THE GERMAN ARMY

15
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:55.958
RETREATS ACROSS THE RIVERÂ SCHELDT.

16
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.375
THE NETHERLANDS EXPECTS
TO BE LIBERATED AT ANY MOMENT.


17
00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:38.833
What's going on here?

18
00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:41.416
Keep moving.

19
00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:51.583
- Just get rid of it.
- Where are the papers?


20
00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:54.875
Hurry up! Everything must go.

21
00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:57.291
For the mayor. Take it.

22
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.958
Go, go, go!

23
00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:12.708
Just throw it away!

24
00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:18.916
And stay with it until
everything has been burned. Understood?


25
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.166
I'll do the last documents myself.

26
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.250
- Sir.
- Yes.


27
00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:38.208
Go.
Teuntje, would you help my wife pack?


28
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.333
And I think you should go home afterwards
and pack your things.


29
00:04:41.416 --> 00:04:42.708
What do you mean?

30
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.416
Your father works for the Germans, no?

31
00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:50.416
For sick Germans and for sick Zeelanders.

32
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.625
- Burn it!
- Yes, of course.


33
00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:05.853
Those are National Socialists!

34
00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:08.291
You can't do that!

35
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.875
- Guess what I'm gonna do!
- Who do you think you are?


36
00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.500
Guess what I'm gonna do. Huh?

37
00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:16.333
Who do you think you are?

38
00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:30.916
Move forwards now.

39
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.250
ELECTRIC BAKERY
SCHOENMAKERS


40
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.083
It's over, Teun.

41
00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:47.916
It's over. We got rid of them.

42
00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:51.708
Come on.
The Canadians have crossed the border.


43
00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:58.375
Who was that man?

44
00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.500
Oh, no one Just some happy man.

45
00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:43.916
Hand me the camera.

46
00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:46.541
Give me the camera.

47
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.750
Where are your liberators?
Huh? Where are they?


48
00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:53.833
Idiots. We're still in command.

49
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:57.791
Watch out.

50
00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:02.500
Hey, move!

51
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.250
Idiot. Move out the way. Move!

52
00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:13.666
Back. Move back.

53
00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:18.125
Ah!

54
00:07:20.916 --> 00:07:22.416
Move.

55
00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:32.416
Don't just stand there.

56
00:07:34.083 --> 00:07:35.250
It was him!

57
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.041
Stop!

58
00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:53.666
Teun.

59
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.083
Teun!

60
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.708
Oh, Teun...

61
00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:14.458
Hmm?

62
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:18.708
Oh, hey.
What's going on? There were shots.


63
00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:22.750
Yeah... there, uh, there was
an accident with a couple of Germans.


64
00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:23.916
Is it serious?

65
00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:27.458
- Is Dirk home yet?
- Haven't seen him yet.


66
00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:32.166
But when he gets home, stay home.
It's chaos in the streets.


67
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.958
- I'm off to the hospital.
- Now?


68
00:08:35.041 --> 00:08:38.083
- They'll be needing me now.
- But we... we are free.


69
00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:42.000
I know, Teun, you're right.
We'll celebrate tomorrow.


70
00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:43.375
Okay?

71
00:08:57.291 --> 00:08:58.291
Dirk?

72
00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:16.083
NARVA, THE RUSSIAN FRONT

73
00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.458
You. Get up! Up!

74
00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:25.333
Into the trenches, now! 
Get into position!

75
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.750
What's going on here?

76
00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:39.541
They're coming.

77
00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:42.083
Get in position!

78
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.416
Quickly! Hold!

79
00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:47.625
Load.

80
00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:51.000
Now show them how hard you are.

81
00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:52.916
We won't give up!

82
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.208
Lukas?

83
00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:58.208
Hey. Hey.

84
00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:00.291
Look at me. Look.

85
00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:03.083
You'll be fine.

86
00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:07.666
Stay low. Okay?

87
00:10:16.041 --> 00:10:17.083
Fire!

88
00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:23.291
Fire!

89
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.625
Lukas! Luuk!

90
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:56.458
Pull back!

91
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.708
Shoot! Shoot!

92
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:04.916
Get up!

93
00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.458
Lukas. Come on.

94
00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:05.708
Lukas!

95
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:09.291
Luuk!

96
00:12:11.791 --> 00:12:12.791
Luuk!

97
00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:14.708
Lukas!

98
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.583
Lukas!

99
00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.166
Luuk!

100
00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:10.166
Dirk.

101
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:14.208
Hey, where have you been?

102
00:13:21.916 --> 00:13:23.291
Idiot.

103
00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:26.333
You could have been killed.

104
00:13:30.416 --> 00:13:32.916
Dad says we have to stay indoors tonight.

105
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.541
You and Dad, you're sissies. Both of you.

106
00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:37.500
Ow.

107
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.625
Not a word to him, okay?

108
00:13:55.583 --> 00:13:57.666
<i>Maintain your low tow position.</i>

109
00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:01.125
<i>Remain directly behind
and in line with me.</i>


110
00:14:01.208 --> 00:14:02.666
<i>Keep focused on my tail.</i>

111
00:14:04.208 --> 00:14:07.041
<i>Is everything under control, chaps? Over.</i>

112
00:14:08.083 --> 00:14:09.083
You bet, sir.

113
00:14:09.625 --> 00:14:12.958
<i>Have you asked yourselves
how a glider pilot gets back, boys?</i>


114
00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:15.833
<i>He doesn't.</i>

115
00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.916
<i>Once you've landed in enemy territory,
there's no way back.</i>


116
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.958
<i>Hence the lovely nickname,
a flying coffin.</i>


117
00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:27.458
<i>We are approaching 1,000 feet.
Prepare yourselves for decoupling. Over.</i>


118
00:14:27.541 --> 00:14:28.958
Roger. Over.

119
00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:54.666
It's right this way.

120
00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:57.333
Idiot.

121
00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:02.958
What?

122
00:15:04.458 --> 00:15:06.625
What the bloody hell was that?

123
00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.208
A roll, sir.

124
00:15:13.291 --> 00:15:14.666
It was a childish maneuver.

125
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.250
In war, there's no place for boys
that want to act the hero.


126
00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:19.500
Grow up.

127
00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:23.083
In war, you've got to
be ready for anything, sir.


128
00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:24.208
Those are your words.

129
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:25.750
My word was also to your father.

130
00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:28.958
I promised him I'd have you back
for Christmas dinner. Alive.


131
00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:31.916
Yeah. There's no need
to break that promise, sir.


132
00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.041
I can still come, sir.

133
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.625
Only with your father's permission.

134
00:15:57.916 --> 00:16:00.083
<i>You want to be part of them?</i>

135
00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:03.291
Of that scum? Of those fascists?

136
00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:06.458
Scum. That's what they are! Trash!

137
00:16:06.541 --> 00:16:09.875
Get lost. Get! 
Get lost, you!

138
00:17:24.625 --> 00:17:25.750
Ah. Van Staveren.

139
00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:31.666
You're very lucky.
We removed a splinter from your guts.


140
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.875
Don't move too much. Try to sleep.

141
00:17:35.083 --> 00:17:40.125
Take a look at these guys.
I wonder if it helps, idiot.


142
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.125
Are you Dutch?

143
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.458
How are you feeling?

144
00:17:58.166 --> 00:17:59.166
Ah.

145
00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:01.083
Are you lost?

146
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.208
Oh, you're on holiday?

147
00:18:06.083 --> 00:18:09.916
I understand.
In beautiful Russia.


148
00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:13.791
With its picturesque scenery
and friendly farmers.


149
00:18:21.041 --> 00:18:22.833
Have you sent a postcard home yet?

150
00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:26.083
Dear Mama...

151
00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.291
A little card from the Third Reich.
It's wonderful here.


152
00:18:31.833 --> 00:18:33.583
I love national socialism.

153
00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:35.500
I would happily die for it.

154
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.333
Are you an officer?

155
00:18:41.666 --> 00:18:43.541
First Lieutenant Friedrich Fischer.

156
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:45.750
Still.

157
00:18:49.541 --> 00:18:51.791
You should actually salute me, but...

158
00:18:52.666 --> 00:18:54.125
have a rest first.

159
00:18:56.458 --> 00:18:58.083
You've earned it.

160
00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:30.500
Hey.

161
00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:33.416
Liberation. What a delusion.

162
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:36.083
The Germans are back, just like that.

163
00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:38.083
The Allies never crossed our border.

164
00:19:43.583 --> 00:19:45.541
They won't just give up on Walcheren.

165
00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:50.333
Three airborne divisions...

166
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.583
35,000 men in military aircraft
and gliders


167
00:19:54.666 --> 00:19:57.125
will depart from 24 airfields,

168
00:19:57.208 --> 00:20:01.125
land in Holland,

169
00:20:02.083 --> 00:20:03.375
with one objective.

170
00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:05.500
Retake Arnhem.

171
00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:09.166
Operation Market Garden.

172
00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.708
After which, we will regroup

173
00:20:11.791 --> 00:20:14.583
and continue in a straight line to Berlin.

174
00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:21.041
To put an end to the dark tyranny

175
00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:23.916
that has heldÂ Europe in its grip
for nearly four years.


176
00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:28.458
Pilots and soldiers,
the success of this operation


177
00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:29.958
lies in your hands.

178
00:20:31.583 --> 00:20:33.500
And with it, the fate of Europe.

179
00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:41.541
Good luck.

180
00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:54.648
- I'll see you at Christmas.
- Yes indeed.


181
00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:06.583
Arnhem.

182
00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:09.750
This is really gonna happen now.

183
00:21:10.708 --> 00:21:11.875
That's the intention.

184
00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:13.916
Been training really hard.

185
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.041
Reached my number of flying hours.

186
00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:20.083
You know what is meant
by a sense of responsibility?


187
00:21:20.166 --> 00:21:22.916
It's been ingrained in me
since I was a child, sir.


188
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.541
That's not apparent
from your last escapade.


189
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:29.083
Or did you think
special rules apply to you?


190
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.083
You're not ready.

191
00:21:35.166 --> 00:21:39.208
And your mother will sleep more easily
knowing you're on the ground.


192
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.416
It's done. I can come.

193
00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.750
- Really?
- Yes.


194
00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:10.458
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, sir.


195
00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:14.541
Don't know how you pulled that off.
But no funny stuff.


196
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.416
All my father did was work.

197
00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:26.625
He grafted from early morning
to late at night for...


198
00:22:27.458 --> 00:22:28.875
for a pittance.

199
00:22:29.833 --> 00:22:31.125
And that will never change.

200
00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:36.625
It will be exactly the same
for my little brother and sisters.


201
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:39.041
Is that fair?

202
00:22:39.583 --> 00:22:41.583
I never saw you as an idealist.

203
00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:45.958
Nothing will change unless someone
does something about it and...


204
00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:48.416
- And I want...
- Strength.


205
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.916
- I want to be proud.
- Equality. Brotherhood.


206
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:57.500
I've learned something, Dutchman.

207
00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:00.875
If the lie is big enough...

208
00:23:02.625 --> 00:23:04.625
and you tell it often enough...

209
00:23:06.166 --> 00:23:08.333
then people start to believe it.

210
00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:10.750
Do you know who said that?

211
00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:14.958
Our Minister of Propaganda,
Joseph Goebbels.


212
00:23:19.125 --> 00:23:21.125
Are there any Jews in your neighborhood?

213
00:23:22.208 --> 00:23:24.958
Most were arrested
at the start of the war.


214
00:23:25.041 --> 00:23:26.083
And?

215
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.666
Did you ever see them again?

216
00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:34.125
There's your equality.

217
00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:40.125
The Jews,
they're all criminals and racketeers.


218
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.125
Does Chelmo mean anything to you?

219
00:23:51.833 --> 00:23:54.875
That's where they put me
when they had no further use for me.


220
00:23:58.166 --> 00:24:01.750
The elderly, the sick, children...

221
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.000
babies...

222
00:24:04.083 --> 00:24:05.375
Jews, yeah.

223
00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:12.333
I was the guard.

224
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.708
There is no such thing as good.

225
00:24:23.583 --> 00:24:24.708
The evil...

226
00:24:26.083 --> 00:24:28.583
in everyone. In every one of us.

227
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:08.541
Get in the trenches.

228
00:25:17.666 --> 00:25:18.875
Idiots. Bastard.

229
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.208
Go. Ahead.

230
00:25:29.291 --> 00:25:30.291
Wim!

231
00:25:31.125 --> 00:25:32.125
Wim.

232
00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:33.958
Come on.

233
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:36.291
Sit down.

234
00:26:09.166 --> 00:26:12.083
- Oberst Berghof.
- Mayor Oostveen.


235
00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:14.583
What can I do for you?

236
00:26:14.666 --> 00:26:18.166
I am responsible
for defending this island.


237
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.416
I cannot let resistance terrorists
go unpunished.


238
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.500
Of course.

239
00:26:23.583 --> 00:26:25.416
If necessary,

240
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.750
I will arrest all the young men
who are registered here.


241
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.541
Of course.

242
00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:36.041
I hope I can count on you.

243
00:26:36.125 --> 00:26:37.583
Have a nice day.

244
00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:40.500
I've heard from a reliable source...

245
00:26:40.583 --> 00:26:43.708
Early this morning, three boys. Innocent.

246
00:26:44.416 --> 00:26:47.791
They will be executed if the person
responsible doesn't turn himself in.


247
00:26:47.875 --> 00:26:50.041
You know he didn't do anything!

248
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:52.875
He was not even there.

249
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.500
They're looking for the person who did it.

250
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.875
You have to go into hiding.

251
00:27:12.166 --> 00:27:13.375
Dad has enough contacts.

252
00:27:15.583 --> 00:27:17.333
Dad works for the Germans.

253
00:27:29.458 --> 00:27:30.625
Janna can help.

254
00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:33.083
Janna?

255
00:27:34.416 --> 00:27:35.708
My Janna?

256
00:27:44.458 --> 00:27:45.958
Hi, Teun.

257
00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:47.041
Hey.

258
00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:49.750
Dirk has to go into hiding and...

259
00:27:50.916 --> 00:27:52.666
and you know where, he says.

260
00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:58.125
They're after him.

261
00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:03.250
Perhaps...

262
00:28:06.041 --> 00:28:08.083
- I know people.
- Yeah? Who?


263
00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:15.750
How come I don't know you know people?

264
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:22.333
Sometimes it's better
not to know too much, Teun.


265
00:28:26.916 --> 00:28:29.208
So, how does Dirk know
that you know people?


266
00:28:37.875 --> 00:28:39.333
What shall we eat?

267
00:28:39.416 --> 00:28:41.375
I would like two bread rolls.

268
00:28:42.125 --> 00:28:43.958
- Please.
- White bread.


269
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:45.125
Yes.

270
00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:46.666
- Delicious.
- Three?


271
00:28:47.958 --> 00:28:50.041
- Hello.
- Hello. Can I help you?


272
00:28:50.125 --> 00:28:52.041
One bread roll and two of those.

273
00:28:53.791 --> 00:28:55.000
<i>Van Staveren...</i>

274
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.208
Volunteer in the navy?

275
00:28:58.166 --> 00:29:00.333
Assigned to the shock troops?

276
00:29:00.416 --> 00:29:01.750
Yes, Sergeant.

277
00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:04.791
I understand that you are better.

278
00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:08.291
Good, I'll...

279
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.208
send you back in.

280
00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:14.750
You start next week.
You're being transferred to Holland.


281
00:29:16.916 --> 00:29:17.958
To Holland?

282
00:29:22.625 --> 00:29:24.791
You leave tomorrow. Dismissed.

283
00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:36.666
Today's your lucky day.

284
00:29:37.875 --> 00:29:41.000
I made a call. 
You're getting a desk job.

285
00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:44.958
In Zeeland, in the south.

286
00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:47.375
Keep your head down, Dutchman.

287
00:29:50.083 --> 00:29:51.916
This shit will be over soon.

288
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:55.083
And then you can start over.

289
00:29:55.166 --> 00:29:56.458
I promise.

290
00:30:46.083 --> 00:30:49.208
<i>We're flying at 6,000 feet.</i>

291
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.166
<i>Thunder Two to Thunder One,
you are two miles to port.</i>


292
00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:57.625
<i>Thunder One
to Thunder Two. Roger.</i>


293
00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:01.041
<i>Thunder One to Thunder Three,
pick up the lead.</i>


294
00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:03.583
<i>Thunder Three
to Thunder One. Roger.</i>


295
00:31:03.666 --> 00:31:05.375
That's it. Nice and steady.

296
00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:13.166
<i>Bomber to Thunder Two. Correct.</i>

297
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.791
<i>Maintain speed.</i>

298
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.166
<i>Thunder Two to Thunder One,
cloud break ahead.</i>


299
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.666
<i>Maintain altitude.</i>

300
00:31:22.041 --> 00:31:26.083
<i>Tow Plane Six to Troop Six.
Is everything under control? Over.</i>


301
00:31:26.166 --> 00:31:28.625
Troop Six, everything's steady. Over.

302
00:31:29.333 --> 00:31:30.833
<i>The lads are having a bet,</i>

303
00:31:30.916 --> 00:31:34.125
<i>and who knows, this could be the last
we hear of you,Â so I'm just going to ask.</i>


304
00:31:34.208 --> 00:31:38.291
<i>Is it true that Monty put your very young
co-pilot forward for this job personally?</i>


305
00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:41.083
You're supposed
to observe radio silence, over.


306
00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:42.833
<i>Is that the young co-pilot himself?</i>

307
00:31:42.916 --> 00:31:46.101
<i>We just want to know what it's like to
have a daddy who's buddies with Churchill.</i>


308
00:31:46.125 --> 00:31:48.750
<i>You'll be sipping tea
at Buckingham Palace when it'sÂ over.</i>


309
00:31:48.833 --> 00:31:52.625
I'm moreÂ focused on the Jerries
I'm aboutÂ to kill, Tow Plane Six, over.


310
00:31:55.458 --> 00:31:58.750
All right.
That's enough out of you please, dingbats.


311
00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:00.833
Keep your eyes on the job at hand.

312
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.791
Ah, Henk, old boy.

313
00:32:14.875 --> 00:32:16.875
I do believe you are home sweet home.

314
00:32:24.708 --> 00:32:26.875
It's beautiful. It's Zeeland.

315
00:32:30.083 --> 00:32:31.083
It's a bit wet.

316
00:33:18.083 --> 00:33:20.000
- <i>Steady.</i>
- Sit down, soldier.


317
00:33:20.083 --> 00:33:21.166
<i>Stay on course.</i>

318
00:33:24.833 --> 00:33:26.041
God.

319
00:33:28.833 --> 00:33:31.375
<i>Keep it straight.
Keep it straight.</i>


320
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:33.916
<i>Stay on course. 
Stay in line.</i>

321
00:33:44.083 --> 00:33:47.416
Blessed is thou amongst women,
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.


322
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.916
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

323
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.416
Pray for us sinners...

324
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.291
Settle down, back there.

325
00:33:52.375 --> 00:33:55.541
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...


326
00:34:08.833 --> 00:34:09.916
Tony.

327
00:34:11.708 --> 00:34:13.875
<i>Tow Six, keep it straight, damn it.</i>

328
00:34:15.708 --> 00:34:18.500
Tony. Tony! Talk to me, are you okay?

329
00:34:19.583 --> 00:34:21.833
Check the wings. 
Check the wings!

330
00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:25.000
The right one's fine.

331
00:34:25.083 --> 00:34:26.791
Henk! Check the left wing!

332
00:34:32.875 --> 00:34:33.875
Gone!

333
00:34:33.916 --> 00:34:35.583
My God.

334
00:34:41.416 --> 00:34:44.041
The left wing's damaged. It's gone.

335
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.875
- Tony, the left wing is gone.
- Release!


336
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.416
Release, William.

337
00:35:00.208 --> 00:35:01.288
<i>Hold course.</i>

338
00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:03.583
It's stuck! The release is stuck.

339
00:35:10.125 --> 00:35:13.375
Listen.
There's too much tension in the cable.


340
00:35:15.208 --> 00:35:17.125
You're going to have to roll it.

341
00:35:18.208 --> 00:35:21.083
Did you hear me?
You're going to have to roll it.


342
00:35:23.875 --> 00:35:26.041
Henk, come forward now! I need you.

343
00:35:26.125 --> 00:35:28.291
<i>You have to release.</i>

344
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.500
<i>What's it going to take
for you to release?</i>


345
00:35:31.583 --> 00:35:33.541
- <i>Release, now!</i>
- You need to focus.


346
00:35:33.625 --> 00:35:36.125
- Pull the release lever as hard...
- What?


347
00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:39.333
Focus, Henk.
In three we're going to go for a roll.


348
00:35:39.416 --> 00:35:42.291
You pull that lever
as hard as you can!

349
00:35:42.375 --> 00:35:44.375
Okay. Ready? Three,

350
00:35:44.458 --> 00:35:45.458
two...

351
00:35:46.958 --> 00:35:48.208
...one!

352
00:35:49.458 --> 00:35:50.916
Release!

353
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.375
Lift it, Will!

354
00:36:12.041 --> 00:36:13.041
Lift it up.

355
00:36:13.083 --> 00:36:14.125
Lift it!

356
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.250
Brace for impact.

357
00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:24.708
Brace!

358
00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:49.458
Dirk.

359
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.041
Dirk.

360
00:37:09.833 --> 00:37:11.500
- Visser family?
- Yes.


361
00:37:11.583 --> 00:37:13.208
Is your father home?

362
00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:14.625
He's on duty.

363
00:37:14.708 --> 00:37:16.291
May I wait here for him?

364
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.750
Lovely.

365
00:37:46.458 --> 00:37:47.750
Tastefully decorated.

366
00:38:02.916 --> 00:38:04.500
Would you like a drink?

367
00:38:04.583 --> 00:38:07.000
Yes. Water would be lovely.

368
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Yes.

369
00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:49.541
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.


370
00:38:57.291 --> 00:38:58.583
Your mother?

371
00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:01.875
Where is she?

372
00:39:02.833 --> 00:39:04.083
In the cemetery.

373
00:39:05.208 --> 00:39:06.333
I'm sorry.

374
00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:15.750
My troops were involved in an accident
two weeks ago.


375
00:39:17.791 --> 00:39:20.291
Three of my men
are in the cemetery now too.


376
00:39:20.375 --> 00:39:21.541
Practically kids.

377
00:39:27.333 --> 00:39:29.958
And that's your brother, I take it.
Wim, right?


378
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:31.375
Dirk.

379
00:39:31.458 --> 00:39:33.750
Ah, yes. Of course. Dirk.

380
00:39:39.916 --> 00:39:42.666
Good day. How can I help you?

381
00:39:49.583 --> 00:39:53.166
Dr. Visser,
it's an honor to meet you.


382
00:39:55.083 --> 00:39:57.291
- Oberst Berghof.
- It's a pleasure.


383
00:39:57.375 --> 00:39:59.375
What can I do for you?

384
00:39:59.458 --> 00:40:01.041
You may be able to help me.

385
00:40:13.125 --> 00:40:14.791
Fuck. Are you okay?

386
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:16.791
Sir?

387
00:40:20.875 --> 00:40:22.583
We've got to get out of here.

388
00:40:27.708 --> 00:40:30.250
Sir, sir, I'm here.

389
00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:35.250
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no.

390
00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:36.458
No, no, no, no, no.

391
00:40:46.625 --> 00:40:48.916
All right, sir, I've got you.

392
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
All right.

393
00:40:55.291 --> 00:40:56.125
Nigel.

394
00:40:56.208 --> 00:40:59.833
- Okay. Just get to dry land.
- They've probably already seen us.


395
00:40:59.916 --> 00:41:01.625
Let's move out. Come on.

396
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:03.833
Come on.

397
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.083
Where the hell are we?

398
00:41:18.666 --> 00:41:22.041
It's been five weeks
and it's only getting worse.


399
00:41:23.041 --> 00:41:25.500
It's very infected.

400
00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:29.250
I'll clean and disinfect the wound now

401
00:41:29.333 --> 00:41:32.541
and afterwards at the hospital, we can...

402
00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:35.916
remove the shrapnel.

403
00:41:36.541 --> 00:41:38.291
You are a true doctor.

404
00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:42.250
Passionate about your calling.

405
00:41:42.916 --> 00:41:44.250
It's very clear.

406
00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:47.833
Someone who does the right thing
in difficult circumstances.


407
00:41:49.166 --> 00:41:51.500
Even if it requires personal sacrifice.

408
00:41:55.333 --> 00:41:57.125
When you speak to your son,

409
00:41:57.208 --> 00:42:00.458
ask him to report to our headquarters.

410
00:42:01.291 --> 00:42:02.458
Yes?

411
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:25.791
- I'm turning myself in.
- No.


412
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:28.833
No, surely you're not doing that.

413
00:42:38.625 --> 00:42:41.166
Janna will help you into hiding.
She promised.


414
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.833
So go pack your things.

415
00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:47.208
If I go into hiding,
Wim and those other boys will die.


416
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.541
I have a good understanding
with the Germans.


417
00:42:50.625 --> 00:42:53.083
- Perhaps if you turn yourself in...
- No.


418
00:42:55.291 --> 00:42:58.708
- Teun, those boys...
- What do I care about those louts?


419
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:01.541
- But they didn't throw that rock.
- It was an accident.


420
00:43:04.166 --> 00:43:07.041
I'll go to Berghof. 
I'll talk to him.

421
00:43:07.666 --> 00:43:09.625
- Negotiate.
- With that man?


422
00:43:09.708 --> 00:43:12.541
Maybe he'll get a prison sentence.

423
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.416
I know how to deal with them, Teun.

424
00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:22.083
And the liberation
won't take that much longer, son.


425
00:43:24.666 --> 00:43:26.250
There's no other way, Teun.

426
00:43:28.625 --> 00:43:32.500
I think the Germans
flooded this island on purpose.


427
00:43:32.583 --> 00:43:34.500
What do you mean, island?

428
00:43:36.875 --> 00:43:40.625
I think this one's called Schouwen.
It's one of the smaller ones.


429
00:43:42.125 --> 00:43:43.791
How far is that from Arnhem?

430
00:43:43.875 --> 00:43:45.625
To Arnhem? How?

431
00:43:48.083 --> 00:43:51.291
We're never going to make it.
Do you know how many Jerries there are?


432
00:43:51.375 --> 00:43:54.041
We don't stand a chance.
Look at the state of us.


433
00:43:54.125 --> 00:43:55.125
Shh!

434
00:44:50.625 --> 00:44:53.333
See? They're already looking for us.

435
00:44:57.583 --> 00:44:59.333
Just let me do the talking, Teun.

436
00:45:02.125 --> 00:45:04.000
Follow me to the first floor.

437
00:45:04.083 --> 00:45:05.083
Ah, yes.

438
00:45:20.083 --> 00:45:22.250
- Mr. Visser.
- Oberst Berghof.


439
00:45:23.375 --> 00:45:24.375
Please.

440
00:45:30.375 --> 00:45:31.708
It's good you're here.

441
00:45:31.791 --> 00:45:35.375
I take it you can tell me more
about the fugitive terrorist.


442
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.875
No. My son isn't a... No.

443
00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:43.500
It was just a moment...

444
00:45:44.083 --> 00:45:45.791
of carelessness.

445
00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:47.791
- It was an accident.
- Yes.


446
00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:50.750
- It was never his intention...
- No, no, we are here...


447
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:53.291
to say...

448
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:58.083
that he is deeply sorry.

449
00:45:58.166 --> 00:46:02.750
And we hope that we
might be able to reach...


450
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.208
a compromise?

451
00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:13.416
You know,
I hold deep respect for people like you.


452
00:46:14.416 --> 00:46:15.875
Whether in war or peace,

453
00:46:15.958 --> 00:46:18.875
your moral compass
always steers you in the right direction.


454
00:46:19.625 --> 00:46:21.583
I value that in my own ranks too.

455
00:46:21.666 --> 00:46:22.833
There's a job to do...

456
00:46:23.541 --> 00:46:26.250
and I try to carry it out
with honor and in good conscience.


457
00:46:27.416 --> 00:46:29.791
But not everyone is up to the task.

458
00:46:31.125 --> 00:46:35.750
Very few people
are as righteous as you, Dr. Visser.


459
00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:39.041
Thank you.

460
00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:40.791
That is why...

461
00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:43.333
um...

462
00:46:44.333 --> 00:46:48.583
my son wants to turn himself in,

463
00:46:48.666 --> 00:46:50.458
under two conditions.

464
00:46:52.375 --> 00:46:53.416
First,

465
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.125
the other boys are to be released.
They are innocent, right?


466
00:46:58.625 --> 00:47:00.250
And the second condition

467
00:47:00.333 --> 00:47:04.291
is that DirkÂ receives
a sentence, naturally,


468
00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:07.250
but a prison sentence,

469
00:47:07.333 --> 00:47:10.541
a life sentence, if need be.

470
00:47:12.416 --> 00:47:14.416
Instead... Instead of...

471
00:47:25.791 --> 00:47:29.333
Let's go.
That man is playing games with you.


472
00:47:32.166 --> 00:47:33.875
What did you say?

473
00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:42.875
That his...

474
00:47:42.958 --> 00:47:45.208
His night shift is about to begin.

475
00:47:49.958 --> 00:47:51.083
What did she say?

476
00:47:54.041 --> 00:47:56.208
That her father has to go to work.

477
00:47:58.958 --> 00:48:00.958
No, no, before that.

478
00:48:09.666 --> 00:48:12.250
She's afraid
that you're playing games with him.


479
00:48:18.833 --> 00:48:22.500
You work for
our honorable Mayor Oostveen, don't you?


480
00:48:25.458 --> 00:48:27.541
People like you and your father,

481
00:48:27.625 --> 00:48:30.833
I am grateful to those
with such a great sense of duty.


482
00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:33.375
Dr. Visser,

483
00:48:33.458 --> 00:48:37.583
you've helped my sick and wounded soldiers
to the best of your ability.


484
00:48:37.666 --> 00:48:39.666
Now let me help you.

485
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.458
I have to sentence your son.
There's nothing I can do about that.


486
00:48:47.083 --> 00:48:51.750
But I will ensure
that his punishment is light.


487
00:48:54.416 --> 00:48:55.750
You have my word.

488
00:49:12.083 --> 00:49:13.541
It's for the best, Teun.

489
00:49:15.291 --> 00:49:16.625
It'll be all right.

490
00:49:24.416 --> 00:49:26.166
Under the table in the basement.

491
00:49:28.125 --> 00:49:29.500
Give it to Janna.

492
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.125
Bye, sis.

493
00:51:08.083 --> 00:51:09.083
Thanks.

494
00:51:13.083 --> 00:51:15.083
I've found an address for Dirk.

495
00:51:15.166 --> 00:51:16.416
He can go there tonight.

496
00:51:23.333 --> 00:51:24.541
Do you know these?

497
00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.708
Dirk's been arrested.

498
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.708
Please give me the photos.

499
00:51:34.208 --> 00:51:36.500
- I'll give them to...
- To your friends?


500
00:51:39.666 --> 00:51:40.666
Yes.

501
00:51:41.333 --> 00:51:44.375
I'm sorry.
But those photos are very important.


502
00:51:45.375 --> 00:51:48.375
You can have them
if you and your friends rescue Dirk.


503
00:51:48.458 --> 00:51:49.708
Teun.

504
00:51:50.375 --> 00:51:52.208
You have to give them to me.

505
00:51:54.166 --> 00:51:55.708
I'll talk to them.

506
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:59.291
I 'm coming.

507
00:52:00.833 --> 00:52:01.875
You can't.

508
00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:07.375
Tonight at eight o'clock. Here.

509
00:52:20.041 --> 00:52:21.041
Hey.

510
00:52:24.833 --> 00:52:26.125
Why have we stopped?

511
00:53:28.458 --> 00:53:30.666
We were supposed to have landed in Arnhem.

512
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.583
In Arnhem?

513
00:53:32.666 --> 00:53:34.541
- That's a long way.
- Yes.


514
00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:38.583
It will be over soon.
Antwerp has been liberated.


515
00:53:38.666 --> 00:53:40.958
And the Canadians
are already in Zeelandic Flanders.


516
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:43.166
- What?
- What did he say?


517
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:46.208
The Canadians
are already over the Belgian border.


518
00:53:46.291 --> 00:53:47.666
That's where we need to be.

519
00:53:49.458 --> 00:53:51.125
Uh, how do we get there?

520
00:53:51.625 --> 00:53:53.958
The Canadians are here?

521
00:53:54.041 --> 00:53:54.916
Yeah.

522
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.416
And you lot are here.

523
00:53:57.916 --> 00:53:58.916
Here.

524
00:54:01.041 --> 00:54:03.708
So they are at the other side
of the islands.


525
00:54:06.666 --> 00:54:08.750
Do you have a boat, here? Boat?

526
00:54:10.041 --> 00:54:11.083
A boat?

527
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:13.458
It was seized.

528
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.500
Being out on the water is too risky.
We're staying here.


529
00:54:18.125 --> 00:54:19.875
The Jerries know we crashed.

530
00:54:19.958 --> 00:54:23.583
They'll be searching for us.
We can't stay in one place long.


531
00:54:23.666 --> 00:54:26.166
It's too dangerous out there.
Especially with...


532
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:27.875
What?

533
00:54:32.541 --> 00:54:34.458
We move out in the morning.

534
00:54:34.541 --> 00:54:35.916
End of discussion.

535
00:55:07.375 --> 00:55:08.708
So you're his sister.

536
00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:15.125
Dirk should never have carried out
an attack on his own.


537
00:55:15.708 --> 00:55:17.541
He threw a stone

538
00:55:17.625 --> 00:55:19.791
that accidentally smashed a windscreen.

539
00:55:21.416 --> 00:55:24.875
- I don't understand...
- Dirk volunteered of his own accord.


540
00:55:24.958 --> 00:55:27.208
- He's 17.
- We're all in danger now.


541
00:55:28.916 --> 00:55:30.875
Especially if he starts talking.

542
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.875
We need those photos.

543
00:56:14.291 --> 00:56:16.375
You work at the town hall, right?

544
00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.833
I can arrange things.

545
00:56:21.291 --> 00:56:24.000
Anything you want. 
Russian stamps, or...

546
00:56:24.083 --> 00:56:25.666
Or I can steal documents.

547
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:27.041
I'm looking for a map.

548
00:56:28.708 --> 00:56:30.416
A tide chart for the Sloe.

549
00:56:31.791 --> 00:56:34.208
Showing the dam and the marshlands.

550
00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:36.583
And if I find
the map, you'll help Dirk?

551
00:56:55.208 --> 00:56:56.833
What do you think?

552
00:56:57.708 --> 00:56:59.625
Is a 17 year old still a child?

553
00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:04.041
Where were you at 17?

554
00:57:04.625 --> 00:57:06.750
At a training camp in Bavaria.

555
00:57:06.833 --> 00:57:07.833
Hmm.

556
00:57:08.875 --> 00:57:10.416
Was that your own choice?

557
00:57:11.125 --> 00:57:12.125
Yes.

558
00:57:16.416 --> 00:57:20.541
This boy knew exactly what he was doing
when he joined the resistance.


559
00:57:20.666 --> 00:57:23.541
I feel sorry for his father and sister

560
00:57:23.625 --> 00:57:25.708
but I can't make any exceptions.

561
00:57:36.333 --> 00:57:38.291
What if it's for the Jerries?

562
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.458
It's useless.
Maybe we should give ourselves up.


563
00:57:54.541 --> 00:57:55.750
What?

564
00:57:57.291 --> 00:57:59.416
- Never.
- We're not giving ourselves up.


565
00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.333
If we do that,
we're as good as dead.

566
00:58:03.125 --> 00:58:04.458
I'd rather drown.

567
00:58:04.541 --> 00:58:07.208
That's easy for you to say,
you're going to die anyway.


568
00:58:08.708 --> 00:58:09.958
Maybe, John.

569
00:58:10.625 --> 00:58:11.833
But not today.

570
00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:16.250
Now stand up. March out.

571
00:58:17.291 --> 00:58:18.291
Move.

572
00:58:47.916 --> 00:58:49.166
Okay, go.

573
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:26.750
Easy.

574
00:59:30.375 --> 00:59:31.291
Easy.

575
00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:39.708
Good work.

576
00:59:40.291 --> 00:59:42.166
I'll go look for some food, sir.

577
00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:45.000
A steak would be great.
Medium rare, please.


578
00:59:52.291 --> 00:59:55.583
Yeah. Yeah.

579
01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:28.666
Oh, gentlemen.

580
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.708
No!

581
01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:39.458
- Yes!
- Whoo!


582
01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:41.461
- There you go. Drink up.
- Cheers.


583
01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.250
It's not bad.

584
01:00:43.333 --> 01:00:45.166
No, it's good, man.

585
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.666
So, how many?

586
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:50.000
How many? What are you talking about?

587
01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:52.416
- How many?
- How many women have you had?


588
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.625
A gentleman does not
disclose such matters.


589
01:00:56.708 --> 01:00:57.708
More than three?

590
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Three?

591
01:01:01.416 --> 01:01:02.625
More than ten?

592
01:01:05.125 --> 01:01:07.041
What about you, Willy? Eh?

593
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:09.833
Young squire?

594
01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:16.333
No?

595
01:01:16.916 --> 01:01:18.500
Of course I have.

596
01:01:20.166 --> 01:01:21.833
You have never.

597
01:01:21.916 --> 01:01:24.541
- Not even with the girls in Ringway?
- Surely.


598
01:01:25.958 --> 01:01:31.166
Jesus, man. We're going to die in a week
and you have never...


599
01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:34.583
That, that is most, uh...

600
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:36.875
unfortunate.

601
01:01:38.708 --> 01:01:42.625
Um, I don't think
there's anything worse than that.


602
01:01:42.708 --> 01:01:45.333
Oh, God. Yes. Leave him alone.

603
01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:49.833
I am not gonna die.

604
01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:31.083
Henk.

605
01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:36.833
Nigel?

606
01:02:44.416 --> 01:02:46.916
John. In the bloody night, John.

607
01:02:47.833 --> 01:02:49.000
They're gone.

608
01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:51.375
Bloody traitors.

609
01:02:53.125 --> 01:02:55.291
- The map, Henk.
- It's in there.


610
01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:56.875
They took my life jacket.

611
01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:05.125
- So they took everything.
- Boys, listen...


612
01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:07.041
They're traitors, sir, bloody traitors!

613
01:03:07.125 --> 01:03:08.125
Listen.

614
01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:15.583
I need you both to
go and get us a boat.

615
01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:18.416
I'm staying here. 
I'll guard the house.

616
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.541
Yeah, right.

617
01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:25.208
Sir, I'm not
leaving you here alone.


618
01:03:26.916 --> 01:03:27.916
Yes, you are.

619
01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:30.625
Get us a boat.

620
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:34.833
That's an order.

621
01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:50.958
We won't give up!

622
01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:04.000
Stop!

623
01:05:07.125 --> 01:05:08.583
Stop!

624
01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:19.416
Stop!

625
01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.125
Stop. Stop!

626
01:05:42.208 --> 01:05:43.833
Calm down.

627
01:05:47.833 --> 01:05:49.000
No!

628
01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:50.416
You know what we want.

629
01:05:50.958 --> 01:05:52.500
No. No!

630
01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:57.833
Give us the names.

631
01:05:58.625 --> 01:06:00.083
No! Stop.

632
01:06:25.625 --> 01:06:27.791
Come on. Come on.

633
01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:37.458
Henk.

634
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:45.583
Oh, God.

635
01:06:46.791 --> 01:06:48.458
You've got to be kidding me.

636
01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:52.583
I thought that Dutch people could swim!

637
01:07:20.541 --> 01:07:21.666
Henk...

638
01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:17.458
Fritz, look what I've found.

639
01:08:20.083 --> 01:08:22.416
Don't touch.
Get your hands off me!


640
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.500
Careful!

641
01:08:27.083 --> 01:08:28.666
There's water here.

642
01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:30.000
Let go.

643
01:08:30.083 --> 01:08:32.541
Come here. Come here.

644
01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:36.125
The things I bloody...

645
01:08:37.666 --> 01:08:39.416
Show me your hands.

646
01:08:41.208 --> 01:08:42.750
Damn it. Stay still.

647
01:08:42.833 --> 01:08:44.333
Call yourselves soldiers?

648
01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:47.083
If he makes another noise, just shoot him.

649
01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:07.958
- Don't shoot. I'm alone.
- Shh!


650
01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:10.291
Easy.

651
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:12.750
Easy.

652
01:09:14.333 --> 01:09:17.166
Let me go
and I won't tell anyone I've seen you.


653
01:09:20.416 --> 01:09:23.250
Easy, my friend. 
I'll do whatever you say.

654
01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:35.625
Hermann?

655
01:09:36.708 --> 01:09:37.958
Hermann, who's there?

656
01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:47.750
Hey, Hermann!

657
01:09:53.833 --> 01:09:56.833
Hermann, what's going on?

658
01:10:02.416 --> 01:10:03.500
Hermann!

659
01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:05.208
Fuck.

660
01:10:13.916 --> 01:10:15.041
Keep an eye on him.

661
01:10:22.208 --> 01:10:24.791
- No, don't shoot.
- Hermann?


662
01:10:27.041 --> 01:10:28.041
Hermann.

663
01:10:28.916 --> 01:10:29.916
Hermann.

664
01:10:36.291 --> 01:10:38.291
- Drop your weapon.
- Shoot, William.


665
01:10:40.125 --> 01:10:41.805
It doesn't matter
what happens, just shoot.


666
01:10:41.833 --> 01:10:43.000
Shut up.

667
01:10:43.083 --> 01:10:44.250
Drop your weapon.

668
01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:46.583
Shoot, William. Shoot. 
Take your shot.

669
01:10:46.666 --> 01:10:47.541
Drop your weapon.

670
01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:48.541
Shut up you...

671
01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:50.750
Put the gun down, please.
Put the gun down.


672
01:10:50.833 --> 01:10:52.708
Put the gun down now!

673
01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:54.416
- Gun down.
- William.


674
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.041
- I don't have a clear shot.
- Doesn't matter, mate.


675
01:10:57.125 --> 01:10:59.041
Squeeze the trigger. Just shoot!

676
01:10:59.125 --> 01:11:01.045
- Take the shot, William!
- Put the gun down now.


677
01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:03.083
Gun down now!

678
01:11:03.166 --> 01:11:05.125
- Shoot!
- Just shut up.


679
01:11:05.208 --> 01:11:08.625
Gun down now! Put the gun down! Now!

680
01:11:08.708 --> 01:11:09.875
Gun down!

681
01:11:29.875 --> 01:11:31.166
Will!

682
01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:35.208
Will!

683
01:11:47.083 --> 01:11:50.416
Will, you don't have to do this. Will!

684
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.666
No, please. Please don't shoot. Don't.

685
01:12:25.333 --> 01:12:26.750
Find their addresses.

686
01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:29.625
As soon as possible.

687
01:12:29.708 --> 01:12:31.541
Five people, all men.

688
01:12:31.625 --> 01:12:34.416
If there had been more,
he would have told me.


689
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.833
He tried to act
tough for the first hour.

690
01:12:39.041 --> 01:12:43.208
But then I increased the pressure
and he eventually named them all.


691
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:44.333
Good.

692
01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:47.875
- Arrest and execute them immediately.
- Mm-hmm.


693
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:51.083
And the boy? What
should we do with him?

694
01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:52.625
No special treatment.

695
01:12:53.375 --> 01:12:54.583
Good.

696
01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:11.750
What?

697
01:13:13.125 --> 01:13:14.291
This is crazy.

698
01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:26.166
Henk.

699
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.708
It's going to be our last chance.

700
01:13:30.708 --> 01:13:32.583
Let's get over. Just us.

701
01:13:42.416 --> 01:13:43.625
Keep moving.

702
01:14:50.833 --> 01:14:52.291
Don't look at me. Walk.

703
01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:56.541
They've made your brother talk.
He's mentioned names.


704
01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:04.458
And Dirk? What will become of him?

705
01:15:06.333 --> 01:15:08.125
What will they do to him?

706
01:15:23.833 --> 01:15:26.291
Don't move. Go forward.

707
01:15:26.958 --> 01:15:27.958
Quickly.

708
01:15:28.416 --> 01:15:32.208
I said, don't move. Stand still.

709
01:15:32.958 --> 01:15:33.958
Hey.

710
01:15:35.458 --> 01:15:37.708
No. Please. Please don't.

711
01:15:38.625 --> 01:15:39.625
Don't move!

712
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.083
Hands up.

713
01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:14.041
There's no need to sit down.

714
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.708
It's a shame about the training camp.

715
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:28.291
Wasted effort.

716
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.208
Pack your things.

717
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:34.875
Report to the courtyard.

718
01:16:44.625 --> 01:16:45.541
Dad!

719
01:16:47.583 --> 01:16:48.625
Daddy.

720
01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:52.750
They're going to shoot him.

721
01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:58.541
Teun, who said? 
What do you mean?

722
01:16:58.625 --> 01:17:01.416
- What can we do?
- Easy now,Â Teun. Easy now.


723
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:05.208
It'll be alright, you'll see.

724
01:17:30.833 --> 01:17:31.913
Get in.

725
01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:00.916
LOCAL COMMAND

726
01:18:09.541 --> 01:18:10.750
Halt, stop there!

727
01:18:11.541 --> 01:18:12.958
- Papers, please.
- Yes.


728
01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:19.791
Go on.

729
01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:47.458
Oberst Berghof.

730
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:52.333
I need to speak toÂ Colonel Berghof.

731
01:18:52.416 --> 01:18:53.833
Oberst Berghof!

732
01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:56.000
Oberst Berghof.

733
01:18:56.666 --> 01:18:58.333
Please may I speak with you?

734
01:18:59.791 --> 01:19:00.791
Please!

735
01:19:01.583 --> 01:19:02.583
Please.

736
01:20:35.583 --> 01:20:36.875
Approach.

737
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:03.916
Ready.

738
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.333
Aim.

739
01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:16.916
Fire.

740
01:21:25.875 --> 01:21:26.875
Stand down.

741
01:23:27.958 --> 01:23:30.291
We need
to get your map to the Allies.


742
01:23:31.541 --> 01:23:33.750
Otherwise everything
will have been in vain.


743
01:23:35.583 --> 01:23:38.125
The German positions are on this side.

744
01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:40.958
Here.

745
01:23:41.375 --> 01:23:42.291
Here.

746
01:23:42.375 --> 01:23:43.541
And here.

747
01:23:43.625 --> 01:23:46.208
Your brother took photographs of them.

748
01:23:48.958 --> 01:23:51.791
The Germans dug themselves inÂ weeks ago.

749
01:23:52.791 --> 01:23:54.791
Everything they've got
is aimed at the Sloedam.


750
01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.166
And here, on the other side...

751
01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:02.500
are the Canadians.

752
01:24:03.416 --> 01:24:05.041
If they cross the dam...

753
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:08.083
there will be a huge massacre.

754
01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:11.791
Their only chance is at high tide.

755
01:24:13.166 --> 01:24:15.375
There's a fairway here,

756
01:24:15.458 --> 01:24:16.666
through the mud...

757
01:24:18.416 --> 01:24:19.833
to the other side.

758
01:24:19.916 --> 01:24:22.375
So that they can attack from here.

759
01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.666
Through this same fairway,

760
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:31.333
you can reach the Allies.

761
01:24:36.208 --> 01:24:37.291
I can't do it.

762
01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:46.291
There's a boat waiting in the mud.
By the Cornelisse farm.


763
01:25:04.541 --> 01:25:05.541
Come on.

764
01:25:17.041 --> 01:25:18.041
Hey.

765
01:25:18.833 --> 01:25:20.708
No, wait. Hey.

766
01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:32.375
Stop. ID, please.

767
01:25:34.375 --> 01:25:35.375
You too.

768
01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:41.041
Go on.

769
01:25:41.666 --> 01:25:42.666
Open it.

770
01:26:02.291 --> 01:26:03.958
Get out. Faster.

771
01:26:04.958 --> 01:26:06.041
Come on, men.

772
01:26:07.708 --> 01:26:09.000
Up. Keep going.

773
01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:17.125
Faster. Keep going.

774
01:26:20.583 --> 01:26:21.583
Faster.

775
01:26:24.583 --> 01:26:25.583
Soldiers.

776
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.666
You are all tired...

777
01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:34.958
sick, cold and wet.

778
01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:38.375
But we mustn't give up.

779
01:26:39.291 --> 01:26:43.250
Walcheren is our stronghold.
Hitler's stronghold.


780
01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:47.833
They will attack us with all their might.

781
01:26:47.916 --> 01:26:51.625
But we will fight
down to the last man.

782
01:26:53.416 --> 01:26:55.166
We won't give up.

783
01:26:57.416 --> 01:26:58.500
Never!

784
01:27:38.666 --> 01:27:39.666
Teun.

785
01:27:39.708 --> 01:27:42.208
Teun, there is no boat.

786
01:27:46.541 --> 01:27:47.791
Keep looking.

787
01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:00.750
Get out of the way.

788
01:28:02.583 --> 01:28:03.791
Everybody out.

789
01:28:05.041 --> 01:28:06.166
All clear.

790
01:28:15.583 --> 01:28:17.000
Bloody hell.

791
01:28:21.916 --> 01:28:23.041
- Hey.
- Not now.


792
01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:25.583
Okay.

793
01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:30.291
One thing's sure, we're all going to die.
Well, they're going to blow us to pieces.


794
01:28:30.375 --> 01:28:32.875
We'll just have to
blow 'em up first then, won't we?


795
01:28:32.958 --> 01:28:33.958
Hey.

796
01:28:34.916 --> 01:28:35.916
Hey.

797
01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:39.416
Cheers.

798
01:28:39.541 --> 01:28:41.291
Yeah, no trouble.

799
01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:42.541
So, what are you?

800
01:28:42.625 --> 01:28:43.833
- Um...
- Airborne?


801
01:28:43.916 --> 01:28:46.875
Yeah. English. 
And you are a...

802
01:28:46.958 --> 01:28:49.000
- Canuck.
- Far from home.


803
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:50.333
Yes.

804
01:28:50.416 --> 01:28:51.916
- What's your name?
- Mm.


805
01:28:52.708 --> 01:28:54.166
- Bill.
- I'm Will.


806
01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:56.333
Hm! Nice to meet you, Will.

807
01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:00.541
You hungry?

808
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:02.666
- Yeah?
- Yes.


809
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:04.791
I'll get you some food,
get you a new uniform.


810
01:30:54.291 --> 01:30:55.375
Now?

811
01:30:56.875 --> 01:30:57.916
Almost.

812
01:31:07.583 --> 01:31:08.583
I'm sorry.

813
01:31:12.458 --> 01:31:13.833
It's not your fault.

814
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:18.083
I should have stopped him.

815
01:31:23.875 --> 01:31:25.541
It's what he wanted.

816
01:31:30.708 --> 01:31:32.958
Thanks for coming along.

817
01:31:36.416 --> 01:31:37.458
Come on.

818
01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.541
Hey! Who goes there?

819
01:32:28.083 --> 01:32:29.083
Push.

820
01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:34.583
Push.

821
01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:44.958
There they are.

822
01:32:46.291 --> 01:32:47.375
Stay low.

823
01:32:55.541 --> 01:32:56.708
Stand still.

824
01:33:00.458 --> 01:33:01.583
Don't move.

825
01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:11.666
We're getting reports.
The causeway's been blown.


826
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:12.750
How bad?

827
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:14.333
Heavily damaged.

828
01:33:15.958 --> 01:33:17.833
We can only get across on foot.

829
01:33:17.916 --> 01:33:19.291
And across the water?

830
01:33:20.708 --> 01:33:23.333
We'll never get across
in our amphibian boats.


831
01:33:23.416 --> 01:33:25.916
Too shallow. Too much mud.

832
01:33:28.666 --> 01:33:30.458
We can only go straight on.

833
01:33:31.458 --> 01:33:34.000
That's suicide. 
We won't stand a chance.

834
01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.333
Certainly not without air cover.

835
01:33:38.208 --> 01:33:40.458
Prepare your men for tomorrow morning.

836
01:33:40.541 --> 01:33:43.000
- Don't think about it, just do it.
- Yes, sir.


837
01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:46.375
Come on. Go on, everyone.

838
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Come on.

839
01:33:48.375 --> 01:33:49.625
Move up, gentlemen.

840
01:33:50.166 --> 01:33:52.166
- Come on.
- Let's go.


841
01:33:53.708 --> 01:33:56.291
- Come on.
- Move out. Come on.


842
01:35:27.916 --> 01:35:29.041
Get into position.

843
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:37.666
Everyone get ready to fire.

844
01:35:38.291 --> 01:35:39.666
Get ready to fire.

845
01:35:43.791 --> 01:35:45.458
Get ready to fire.

846
01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:18.666
Get down! Get down!

847
01:36:19.541 --> 01:36:21.458
Get down on the ground!

848
01:36:38.583 --> 01:36:39.750
Ah!

849
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.583
Move forward! Move forward!

850
01:36:47.875 --> 01:36:49.041
Go! Go!

851
01:36:55.541 --> 01:36:56.875
Move! Move!

852
01:36:58.125 --> 01:36:59.458
Shoot for cover.

853
01:37:08.166 --> 01:37:09.208
Keep going.

854
01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:13.625
Will. Come on.

855
01:37:15.333 --> 01:37:16.833
Will, we've got to go.

856
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:19.000
We've got to move.

857
01:37:22.916 --> 01:37:24.583
Move! Move! Move!

858
01:37:26.125 --> 01:37:27.208
Take cover!

859
01:37:38.125 --> 01:37:41.083
Soldiers, spread out!

860
01:37:42.583 --> 01:37:43.583
Spread out.

861
01:37:46.583 --> 01:37:48.958
Come on!

862
01:37:49.041 --> 01:37:50.083
Bill.

863
01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:55.208
Ah!

864
01:38:03.416 --> 01:38:06.875
Get cover!
Get cover right now.


865
01:38:06.958 --> 01:38:08.250
Check your weapons!

866
01:38:31.166 --> 01:38:33.083
Push on through.

867
01:38:33.166 --> 01:38:35.166
Come on. Push on through.

868
01:39:02.208 --> 01:39:03.333
Get that Bren up.

869
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:06.250
Get it up. Fire.

870
01:39:06.333 --> 01:39:07.458
Fire.

871
01:39:21.916 --> 01:39:23.083
Push up! Push up!

872
01:39:32.791 --> 01:39:34.125
Load.

873
01:39:39.833 --> 01:39:40.833
Faster.

874
01:39:43.083 --> 01:39:45.875
Move. Move! Look out.

875
01:39:47.166 --> 01:39:49.541
Come on. Let's get out there.

876
01:40:11.375 --> 01:40:13.750
Marines, 8,000. 
Prepare to fire.

877
01:40:14.958 --> 01:40:16.041
Fire.

878
01:40:16.125 --> 01:40:17.500
Push forward.

879
01:40:26.666 --> 01:40:27.916
Move! Move!

880
01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:42.125
Bill! We've got to get out of here.
We've got to go!


881
01:40:44.541 --> 01:40:47.041
- Keep firing.
- Move. Move!


882
01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:48.708
Keep your heads down.

883
01:40:48.791 --> 01:40:49.875
Follow me.

884
01:40:55.541 --> 01:40:57.291
Here. Give me your hand.

885
01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:05.750
This is madness.

886
01:41:09.958 --> 01:41:11.750
Move! Move! Move!

887
01:41:16.708 --> 01:41:17.708
Move up.

888
01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:21.541
Hey!

889
01:41:34.583 --> 01:41:35.666
Joe.

890
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:36.916
Bill.

891
01:41:38.958 --> 01:41:40.083
No!

892
01:41:42.375 --> 01:41:44.375
Joe!

893
01:41:49.666 --> 01:41:51.541
Now. Get him.

894
01:41:51.625 --> 01:41:52.958
Move it!

895
01:41:57.708 --> 01:41:59.250
Retreat.

896
01:41:59.333 --> 01:42:00.541
Bill, let's go!

897
01:42:00.625 --> 01:42:02.166
- Go.
- Retreat!


898
01:42:02.250 --> 01:42:04.791
- We've got to get out of here.
- Move!


899
01:42:04.875 --> 01:42:06.458
Fall back.

900
01:42:08.958 --> 01:42:10.250
Retreat.

901
01:42:10.333 --> 01:42:11.333
Retreat!

902
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.750
Move, move, move!

903
01:42:26.083 --> 01:42:27.541
Cease fire.

904
01:42:28.458 --> 01:42:29.750
Cease fire.

905
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.250
Cease fire.

906
01:44:54.041 --> 01:44:55.541
Take this to the major.

907
01:45:03.250 --> 01:45:04.250
Sir.

908
01:45:49.791 --> 01:45:52.416
We'll have an hour and a half
before it dries up.


909
01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:54.375
How long until we can get across?

910
01:45:55.333 --> 01:45:59.250
We can cross in four hours.
Then the water will be high enough.


911
01:46:00.958 --> 01:46:04.625
You'll come ashore here. We'll attack them
and you'll hit them on the flank.


912
01:46:05.458 --> 01:46:07.875
I'll have my men prepared for the attack.

913
01:47:09.708 --> 01:47:12.083
Come. Quickly.

914
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.375
Come. Quickly.

915
01:47:14.791 --> 01:47:15.875
Quickly.

916
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:49.041
Keep firing.

917
01:47:54.708 --> 01:47:57.750
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!

918
01:48:09.583 --> 01:48:10.583
Stand up.

919
01:48:14.208 --> 01:48:15.625
Stand up.

920
01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:19.375
Stand up, now.

921
01:48:22.458 --> 01:48:24.041
No!

922
01:48:24.125 --> 01:48:25.291
Shoot.

923
01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:27.625
Shoot.

924
01:48:54.916 --> 01:48:56.125
Pull out.

925
01:49:10.625 --> 01:49:12.041
Go! Go! Go!

926
01:51:16.458 --> 01:51:17.458
Hmm?

927
01:52:55.041 --> 01:52:56.041
Move!

928
01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:25.500
Hey.

929
01:53:26.041 --> 01:53:27.125
Bill.

930
01:53:52.375 --> 01:53:54.708
Get in! Hurry up!

931
01:53:57.125 --> 01:53:58.208
Get out!

932
01:53:58.291 --> 01:54:00.083
Keep going!

933
01:54:08.083 --> 01:54:09.083
Keep going!

934
01:54:14.333 --> 01:54:16.666
Fritz, hurry up. Get in.

935
01:54:17.291 --> 01:54:18.833
Fritz, hurry up. Get in!

936
01:54:24.458 --> 01:54:28.416
Open up! Open the fucking door!

937
01:54:30.666 --> 01:54:32.541
Did you think we forgot about you?

938
01:54:34.416 --> 01:54:35.500
Lie down!

939
01:54:38.958 --> 01:54:39.958
Lie down!

940
01:54:40.625 --> 01:54:41.666
Ah!

941
01:54:43.083 --> 01:54:44.333
It's your turn.

942
01:54:46.125 --> 01:54:47.166
Huh?

943
01:57:05.958 --> 01:57:07.000
Hey.

944
01:57:07.916 --> 01:57:09.166
You'll be fine.

945
01:58:31.791 --> 01:58:32.958
Clear!

946
01:59:58.291 --> 02:00:02.791
On 7 November 1944
Walcheren was liberated.


947
02:00:02.875 --> 02:00:09.875
The Allied ships
could now reach the port of Antwerp.


948
02:00:09.958 --> 02:00:16.916
The final offensive
against Germany could begin.


949
02:00:19.625 --> 02:00:21.541
At the battle of the Scheldt

950
02:00:21.625 --> 02:00:27.416
3, 231 Allies, 4,250 Germans
and 2,283 civilians lost their lives.


951
02:00:30.125 --> 02:00:35.750
The Netherlands was liberated
on May 5th, 1945.
