00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:56.842
Wall Street
is one big turf war.


2
00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.011
The basic concept
of Wall Street,


3
00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:02.014
which sometimes the regulators
lose sight of,


4
00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.850
is, it's a for-profit
enterprise.


5
00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:07.019
By benefiting one person,

6
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.354
you're disadvantaging
another person.


7
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.041
[indistinct conversation]

8
00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.209
I had no inkling that

9
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.420
anything was gonna
change my life that day.


10
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.923
Okay, guys, let's get ready
to go to karate.


11
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:36.924
Come on.
Get your stuff.


12
00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.592
Let's go.

13
00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.473
Wall Street veteran
Bernie Madoff


14
00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.308
has been arrested
and charged with running


15
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.477
a $50-billion
Ponzi scheme.


16
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.979
This is one of the biggest
fraud cases ever.


17
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.814
His name is Bernard Madoff.

18
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:54.650
He is under arrest,
charged with running...


19
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.152
The SEC accusing
Bernard Madoff


20
00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:58.487
and his investment firm...

21
00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.823
You don't get to steal
that much money overnight.


22
00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.825
I don't know
if you can answer this-


23
00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:06.161
But he had 17 billion
under management.


24
00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.496
How do we get up to that?

25
00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:08.664
And his investment firm...

26
00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.457
The SEC doesn't pay attention
to it.


27
00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.006
Assumed the right things
were invested...


28
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:19.716
We lost everything.

29
00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:21.218
We lost everything.

30
00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.594
We are major crime victims.

31
00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.180
Bernie Madoff stole
every dime we gave to him.


32
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.557
$1.3 million.
That's all gone.


33
00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:28.725
The retirement is never.

34
00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:29.893
I guess his addiction
was money.


35
00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:31.270
The only sorrow he feels

36
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.605
is that he got caught,
and he's behind bars.


37
00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:34.940
The government let us down.

38
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.900
They were supposed to watch him,
and they didn't.


39
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.568
What is the purpose
of the SEC


40
00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.737
other than
to investigate fraud?


41
00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:42.739
Where were they?

42
00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.202
Shortly after
Bernard Madoff confessed,


43
00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:49.663
I got a call from
the former chairman of the SEC


44
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:53.125
asking me to investigate
how come the SEC


45
00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:56.169
did not uncover
Madoff's Ponzi scheme.


46
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.838
What the heck went on?

47
00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.965
We did not bring
an enforcement action.


48
00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:03.302
We're using the Madoff scandal
as a platform


49
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:06.596
to set the basis
for regulatory reform.


50
00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:14.313
Nothing about this case
was ever believable.


51
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.981
It was always
the twilight zone.


52
00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.816
And that's how you knew
it was the Madoff case,


53
00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.318
'cause every time
you saw something,


54
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.986
it never made sense.

55
00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.005
Joined Rampart August 1991.

56
00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.715
Started out
as a portfolio manager


57
00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.508
and worked for
the chief investment officer.


58
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.511
Harry's a loveable,
affable geek.


59
00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.680
He's extremely bright,

60
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:53.018
magnitudes brighter than me.

61
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.521
And he can
make the numbers dance.


62
00:05:56.522 --> 00:06:00.359
I mean, he looks at numbers,
and they sing a song to him.


63
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.194
Frank Casey was the horse

64
00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.695
that did the work
on the money.


65
00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.030
He was the moneyman.

66
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.700
My first impression
of Harry was, I would say,


67
00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:12.537
maybe the crazy professor.

68
00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.206
Neil was my backstop.

69
00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:16.041
He would look at all the math,
all the formulas,


70
00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.542
prove all the math,
all the formulas.


71
00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:18.877
Check all the spreadsheets.

72
00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.712
I was trying at the time

73
00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:23.048
to build a new product
for Rampart,


74
00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.050
and when Harry
mentioned to me


75
00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.220
that he knew a fellow
down in New York


76
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:31.723
that had hired a manager,
a single manager,


77
00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:34.726
instead of a group
of 30 or 35 of them,


78
00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.561
who was putting out
a return stream


79
00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:38.730
similar to what
I was trying to do,


80
00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:41.233
this I had to go see.

81
00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.567
That's when I went down
to New York


82
00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:46.321
to meet the investor
that had hired this manager:


83
00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:48.490
Thierry de la Villehuchet.

84
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:51.743
He said, "Well, I can't tell you
anything about him."


85
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.746
And that perked my ears up.

86
00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:57.833
I had been around Wall Street
since 1974,


87
00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.293
and very seldom do you ever hear
of a manager


88
00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:01.795
that no one can talk about.

89
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.755
So I begged him

90
00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:06.341
for the opportunity to compete
with this fellow.


91
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.262
He showed me
the return stream,


92
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.432
and I brought them
back to Harry in Boston.


93
00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.811
Late '99, Frank comes back
from New York,


94
00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.188
and he hands me
a marketing document.


95
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.654
Read the strategy description.

96
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.489
Looked at
the performance line.


97
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.033
It was straight up,

98
00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:35.203
It looked like nothing from
finance that I've ever seen,


99
00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:38.707
'cause the markets go up,
then they go down.


100
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:41.835
Harry looked at it for no more
than four or five minutes.


101
00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:42.878
He turned to me.

102
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.296
He says, "Frank,
you know options.


103
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.131
You know this is a fraud."

104
00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:49.301
[indistinct
police radio transmission]


105
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.637
And he said,
"Are you sure?


106
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.640
"Is your math good enough
to figure this out?


107
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:57.309
Can you reverse engineer it?"

108
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.144
And so I felt, you know,
a little bit offended,


109
00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.604
and my pride was wounded.

110
00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.481
"What do you mean,
something wrong with my math?


111
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.607
"These numbers don't exist.

112
00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:04.816
"Don't you understand?

113
00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:06.485
"You don't get straight lines
in finance.


114
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:07.736
It never happens."

115
00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:09.571
I said, "Oh, but, Harry,
I need to believe.


116
00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.656
Come on.
We got to compete."


117
00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.159
So he began building
mathematical models


118
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.662
to show what the probability
would look like,


119
00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:19.164
what the returns
would look like


120
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:22.209
if this guy was actually doing
what he said he was doing.


121
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.211
And after four hours,
I knew this was explosive.


122
00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:26.213
This is gonna
rock the world.


123
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.179
Everybody's gonna
sit up and take notice.


124
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:37.766
I remember Harry looking
at the numbers and saying,


125
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:42.020
"Frank, if this guy was
a professional baseball player,


126
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.023
he would be hitting a .964."

127
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.276
It was pretty clear
that it was a fraud.


128
00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:50.278
It took me five minutes
to figure it out.


129
00:08:57.119 --> 00:09:00.121
Thierry de la Villehuchet
was a sailor,


130
00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:01.873
and I'm a sailor.

131
00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:05.001
We built a bit of a rapport
that first day.


132
00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:08.797
I said to Thierry,
"How much is this guy running?"


133
00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:09.839
He says, "Oh, I don't know.

134
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.259
I'd say $2 billion
or $3 billion."


135
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.552
So that made him
automatically


136
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.887
the largest manager
on Wall Street at the time,


137
00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:18.223
and no one knew
that he was doing it.


138
00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.559
He then mentioned
that his money manager


139
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.061
was Bernie Madoff.

140
00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.697
I said, "Okay,
this is a massive fraud.


141
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.699
"It's the biggest fraud ever.

142
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.034
I better have somebody
recheck my math."


143
00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:40.704
And so I gave my math
to Neil Chelo,


144
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.373
who was my assistant
portfolio manager at the time.


145
00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:47.043
My initial thought was,
"Too good to be true,


146
00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:48.545
but maybe I'm missing
something."


147
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.088
I needed to dig in.

148
00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.924
So he checked,
and he ran through all the math.


149
00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.926
Now, this wasn't gray area.

150
00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.761
This was black-and-white.

151
00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.597
This was fraud.

152
00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.473
When I first saw
this portfolio-


153
00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:01.975
seven times bigger

154
00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.810
than the number of options
in existence.


155
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:06.313
So if you only have
this many options in existence


156
00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.148
and you're
seven times larger,


157
00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.734
that's a problem.

158
00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.902
Harry said,
"Frank, you're an options guy.


159
00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:14.738
"You know that
this can't be true.


160
00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.906
It's got to be a fraud."

161
00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:18.575
And then he says,
"I probably-


162
00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:21.202
I figure it's even a Ponzi."

163
00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.079
And I said, "Whoa.

164
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.874
That's a big word."

165
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.467
You're basically
robbing Peter to pay Paul.


166
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.968
It was called
a Peter-and-Paul scheme


167
00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:39.304
before Ponzi came about
in Boston


168
00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.972
in the late '20s,
early '30s.


169
00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.807
What I do is,
I bring the money in,


170
00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:44.643
and I'm always paying
everybody else-


171
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.144
the earlier investors-

172
00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:48.521
with the money
that I'm bringing in.


173
00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:50.857
You need an ever-increasing
flow of new victims


174
00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:53.276
to pay off
the old victims.


175
00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:55.945
You can build
that Ponzi scheme up


176
00:10:55.946 --> 00:11:00.283
until it becomes so big
that its own weight crashes it,


177
00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:02.619
because you cannot raise money
fast enough


178
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.622
to pay back all the people
you owe a return to.


179
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.842
I went to some
very sophisticated,


180
00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.511
successful friends of mine

181
00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.680
who are established
on Wall Street,


182
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.183
and they both suggested
different ways


183
00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:27.102
in which to invest my money,

184
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:30.063
one of which was to invest
in the Ascot Fund,


185
00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:33.066
which turns out,
unbeknownst to me at the time,


186
00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:35.902
to be a 100% feeder fund
for Bernie Madoff.


187
00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:37.946
And once the money
was put in,


188
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:41.449
you got these wonderful
monthly reports.


189
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.119
Every month, you were richer
than the month before.


190
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.620
What could be bad?

191
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:47.622
And life went on.

192
00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:51.626
And we didn't take money out,
and it just grew.


193
00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:56.840
And now, you got to remember
that this guy, Madoff,


194
00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.175
he became
the chairman of NASDAQ.


195
00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:03.012
I mean, this was a very
powerful, prominent man


196
00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:05.181
who ran a major
trading company.


197
00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:07.016
You didn't make
accusations lightly


198
00:12:07.017 --> 00:12:09.686
against an individual
like that.


199
00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:10.895
The fact that the market

200
00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.231
goes down 300 points
or up 300 points,


201
00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:15.066
take my word,
but for the most part,


202
00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:16.901
you can ignore
all of that stuff,


203
00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:20.530
if you're investing for
your retirement or whatever,


204
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:24.701
you don't have to get involved
in all these insane moves


205
00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:26.244
that occur in the marketplace.

206
00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:27.746
It's unfortunate for me

207
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.290
that I have to deal with this
every day.


208
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.463
And then Harry took it

209
00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:39.966
to the Boston Securities
and Exchange Commission


210
00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:41.468
in May of 2000.

211
00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:49.434
The mission of the SEC
is to protect investors;


212
00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:52.103
maintain fair, orderly,
and efficient markets;


213
00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:54.689
and to facilitate
capital formation.


214
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.400
In the wake
of the Great Depression,


215
00:12:57.401 --> 00:12:59.944
Ferdinand Pecora examined
high-profile witnesses


216
00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.781
and uncovered many abusive
practices by the banks.


217
00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:04.115
This led to the formation

218
00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:05.909
of the Securities
and Exchange Commission,


219
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.577
the government body
that exists today


220
00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:09.871
to regulate
U.S. financial markets


221
00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:12.540
and to protect your savings.

222
00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:17.420
I called Ed Manion
over at the SEC's Boston office.


223
00:13:17.421 --> 00:13:19.088
And he said to them,

224
00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:22.091
"I've got a fraud here
that you need to investigate."


225
00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:23.927
You know,
our hope was that the SEC


226
00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:27.263
was gonna quickly do something
about it.


227
00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:34.854
I wasn't surprised
that Harry decided to push.


228
00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:37.357
He never asked for counsel
before he went to the SEC.


229
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:38.775
He just did it.

230
00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.196
He was calling

231
00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:46.199
one of the most successful
people on Wall Street


232
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.035
a fraud in a Ponzi scheme,

233
00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:51.871
and had that knowledge
become known,


234
00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:56.251
he could have ruined entirely
someone's investment career.


235
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.221
Days passed.
Weeks passed.


236
00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:09.722
Months passed.

237
00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:13.393
And we never saw
anything happen.


238
00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:17.856
Madoff just continued
to report good numbers.


239
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:19.691
What happened here?

240
00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:24.362
We literally receive hundreds
of thousands of complaints


241
00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:26.656
every year,
hundreds of thousands.


242
00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:28.157
We were surprised,
I guess,


243
00:14:28.158 --> 00:14:33.496
at the extent of the lack
of appropriate investigation.


244
00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:34.998
You know, when we first
went into it,


245
00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:38.835
we thought perhaps that
they had done certain things,


246
00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.837
but Madoff
was able to fool them


247
00:14:40.838 --> 00:14:43.506
and would always provide
false documents to them,


248
00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:46.009
and there was almost nothing
they could do to uncover it.


249
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.176
But what we found was,

250
00:14:47.177 --> 00:14:48.761
there were steps
they could have taken.


251
00:14:48.762 --> 00:14:49.971
They simply didn't take them.

252
00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:54.642
Our economy is in crisis.

253
00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:57.478
We thought the enemy
was Mr. Madoff.


254
00:14:57.479 --> 00:15:00.481
I think it's you.

255
00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:02.483
You were the shield.

256
00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:04.986
You were the protector.

257
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.529
How are we supposed
to stop Madoff?


258
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.364
He had many billions of dollars
to protect.


259
00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:12.035
If he had found out about us,
that could have been dangerous.


260
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.202
And here's the reason

261
00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:15.204
we were worried about risk
for Harry.


262
00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:17.373
There was this fellow

263
00:15:17.374 --> 00:15:19.208
that had blown the whistle

264
00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.377
on a big mutual fund fraud
up in Boston,


265
00:15:21.378 --> 00:15:23.379
and they found
that poor fellow beat


266
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.882
and left for dead
in a parking lot.


267
00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.095
I think there was
a legitimate threat there.


268
00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:35.600
I mean, Madoff
was a very powerful man.


269
00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.436
And so Harry was fearful
for his life.


270
00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:41.648
And he began finding ways
to protect himself.


271
00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:02.752
Harry Markopolos and I
have known each other


272
00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:05.922
since shortly after
Harry moved into town


273
00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:09.092
and came into my office
due to the fact


274
00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:13.221
of wanting to be issued
a firearms permit.


275
00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:21.938
We talked about,

276
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:23.439
"Do you think
at any point in time,


277
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.275
"you might want
to kick it up a notch


278
00:16:26.276 --> 00:16:29.445
and have it
for self-protection?"


279
00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:32.949
You hate to think
about those things,


280
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.410
but you better
think about them.


281
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:41.499
I was asking
a lot of questions.


282
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.501
I was making
a lot of phone calls.


283
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.338
I figured, anybody
who was stealing that large


284
00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:50.883
would go to extreme measures
to protect the scheme,


285
00:16:50.884 --> 00:16:53.052
protect the organization.

286
00:16:53.053 --> 00:16:57.557
And I was worried about getting
taken off the playing field.


287
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.452
You have to be
a real evil person to do this,


288
00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:20.288
and no telling
where they're gonna stop,


289
00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:22.123
where the line is
that they won't cross.


290
00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:23.791
So you just have to assume
there is no line,


291
00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:26.961
and you have to take extreme
measures to protect yourself.


292
00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:29.797
So I was very frightened,

293
00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:31.716
terrified.

294
00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:44.020
He was a very good child

295
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:47.356
until he became three,

296
00:17:47.357 --> 00:17:50.526
and then he got into
a lot of little mischief.


297
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.321
Questioned the teachers,
in fact.


298
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:55.656
He said that they didn't have
the correct question


299
00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:58.326
to his answers.

300
00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:01.829
Well, my school
was a very small, Catholic,


301
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.999
all-male preparatory school.

302
00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:10.880
These are our trophies
from athletics.


303
00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.382
You can see that we won
many district championships


304
00:18:13.383 --> 00:18:15.051
and many, many state titles.

305
00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:16.677
I mean, this school
has never been afraid


306
00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:18.429
of playing much bigger schools
in sports.


307
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.932
We were never afraid
of backing down academically.


308
00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.975
Whether it was our debate team
or our football team,


309
00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:25.311
we would take on all comers.

310
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.735
Basically,
what they told us was,


311
00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:34.737
you have to stand
for something,


312
00:18:34.738 --> 00:18:37.907
and you have to be able to fight
for what you stand for.


313
00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:42.036
I've fought many a time
and not won.


314
00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:44.038
You know, most people
were bigger than me,


315
00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:46.541
so you just get used to it.

316
00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:47.875
I don't mind losing.

317
00:18:47.876 --> 00:18:50.211
You just have to show up.

318
00:18:55.342 --> 00:18:58.845
The management of Rampart
and even myself


319
00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:00.346
were praying
that we could come up


320
00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:01.681
with something to compete.

321
00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:04.350
So Neil and I are talking
back and forth,


322
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:05.852
and we're complaining,
both of us,


323
00:19:05.853 --> 00:19:07.854
about the pressure we're getting
from marketing.


324
00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.689
And it's hard
to compete with someone


325
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.775
if you're competing
with a fraud.


326
00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:18.114
We tried to develop
at Rampart


327
00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:20.950
other products
that we might be able to get


328
00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:24.453
Thierry de la Villehuchet
to market for us.


329
00:19:24.454 --> 00:19:28.124
Thierry was a French nobleman
and a noble man.


330
00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:32.461
He formed a company called
Access International Advisors.


331
00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:34.630
And the word "access"
was the key.


332
00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:37.967
He was getting you access,
if you were a foreign investor,


333
00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:39.635
to some of the best
money managers


334
00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:41.804
in the United States.

335
00:19:41.805 --> 00:19:45.600
And I wanted access
to his people at Access.


336
00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.231
Thierry showed me
pieces of paper,


337
00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:55.401
and he said, "These are
the trade confirmations


338
00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:57.236
I get from Bernie Madoff
every day."


339
00:19:57.237 --> 00:20:00.907
And he was giving the papers
to clerks.


340
00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.742
I said, "What are you
doing this for?"


341
00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:05.244
And Thierry said,
"Well, I'm trying to make sure


342
00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:09.582
"that these daily confirmations
that I get actually match up


343
00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:13.002
with my monthly statements
that Bernie mails me."


344
00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.170
All Bernie was doing

345
00:20:14.171 --> 00:20:17.423
was coming up
with fake trade tickets


346
00:20:17.424 --> 00:20:19.759
that reportedly show
that he was generating


347
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.762
those types of returns
that everyone wanted.


348
00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.557
I said, "He makes up
these pieces of paper."


349
00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.351
And then that's
when Thierry said,


350
00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:30.519
"Frank, you just don't
understand.


351
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.689
We have done everything
to check this guy out."


352
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.234
You could have shut Madoff
down in one half hour


353
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:38.736
by just following up
on one of his allegations


354
00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:40.947
that they were not
conducting trades.


355
00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:43.616
As to the specifics
of the investigation,


356
00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:44.909
I can't answer.

357
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.245
The most basic step
that one takes


358
00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.580
in order to figure out
whether somebody is trading is,


359
00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:51.916
you have these independent
third parties.


360
00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.085
So when you conduct
a trade,


361
00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.587
you have to clear it
through some third party.


362
00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:59.590
So they asked Madoff
whether he clears through DTC.


363
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:01.092
He said, "Yes."

364
00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.261
So he though-he said to us
that, you know,


365
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.096
he remembers that night,

366
00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:08.099
that he knew, the next day,
the whole thing would come out.


367
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.268
But the SEC never called DTC.

368
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.852
They never requested
the information.


369
00:21:11.853 --> 00:21:15.022
People were seeing
the SEC go in.


370
00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:16.440
Nothing was found,
and they said,


371
00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.484
"Green light
for investing with Bernie."


372
00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:19.527
And they did.

373
00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:20.945
They invested more money
with him.


374
00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:24.448
The Security and Exchange
Commission gave a green light.


375
00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:26.075
They said, you know,
"It's safe.


376
00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:27.910
Put your money there."

377
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:30.413
So we put our money there,
trusting him


378
00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:32.540
and mostly trusting
our government.


379
00:21:43.885 --> 00:21:46.721
If our bosses knew

380
00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:49.598
that we were pursuing
a case against Madoff,


381
00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:51.767
they would have told us
to shut down the investigation.


382
00:21:51.768 --> 00:21:53.352
So it would have been
a career risk for us


383
00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:54.687
if we hadn't complied.

384
00:21:54.688 --> 00:21:57.106
And, of course, we had
no intention of complying.


385
00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:58.441
You can always find
another job,


386
00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:00.109
but you always have to live
with yourself


387
00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.611
if you don't do
the right thing.


388
00:22:04.114 --> 00:22:08.784
Been out of the army,
at that point, five years.


389
00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:10.286
You know, but I took an oath.

390
00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:14.457
I took an oath to support
and defend the Constitution


391
00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:15.958
and this nation
against all enemies,


392
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.460
foreign and domestic.

393
00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:20.463
So I looked at Madoff
as a domestic enemy.


394
00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:22.298
And Frank Casey,
he was in the army too


395
00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:23.966
as an officer
just like I was.


396
00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.801
He took the same oath.

397
00:22:25.802 --> 00:22:30.139
We began building
an intelligence network.


398
00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.809
We were trying to find people
who were invested with Madoff


399
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.813
since no one would declare that
they were invested with Madoff.


400
00:22:37.814 --> 00:22:42.818
We knew pretty much every
broker that traded options.


401
00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:46.030
We went out, and we spoke
to all these brokers.


402
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:47.740
They would
try to give up information


403
00:22:47.741 --> 00:22:49.909
without disclosing too much
about their clients.


404
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.827
I would give up information
without disclosing


405
00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:53.829
that I was actually hunting
Madoff.


406
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.664
And I would say simply
to some analysts,


407
00:22:55.665 --> 00:22:58.000
"What do you know
about Bernie?"


408
00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:00.669
You never even had to use
the last name.


409
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.171
And they would always
come back with,


410
00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:03.839
"What do you know
about Bernie?"


411
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.674
And everyone
we talked to said,


412
00:23:05.675 --> 00:23:07.676
"I don't do business
with Madoff,


413
00:23:07.677 --> 00:23:10.805
"but I heard he's a huge player
in the options market.


414
00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:12.473
Can you get me
an introduction?"


415
00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:20.731
You didn't want a secret
getting out like this


416
00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:23.234
because that could only
result in harm.


417
00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:32.701
My wife knew.

418
00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.997
We didn't have children
at that time,


419
00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:38.874
and so, you know,
if the worst they're gonna do


420
00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:42.503
is shoot my wife or me,
that's bad for us.


421
00:23:42.504 --> 00:23:43.838
But at least Neil and Frank

422
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:45.673
can go forward
to the authorities,


423
00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:47.842
and it makes the case
pretty compelling.


424
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:50.678
"Hey, Harry died
of acute lead poisoning


425
00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:52.847
of the high-speed
multiple-entry-wound variety."


426
00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:08.320
She's petite, well-spoken,
well-mannered,


427
00:24:08.321 --> 00:24:12.158
well-educated,
a good conversationalist.


428
00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.410
It was
a very strange wedding.


429
00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:16.412
They had a band
in this Chinese restaurant


430
00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:18.914
with a big dragon
across the wall,


431
00:24:18.915 --> 00:24:20.583
but they had a Greek band.

432
00:24:21.751 --> 00:24:24.253
That's Harry for you.

433
00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:26.088
I was way too young
when I got married.


434
00:24:26.089 --> 00:24:27.423
I was only 42.

435
00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:30.759
I really didn't know
what I was doing.


436
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.761
And I started
the Madoff case


437
00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:35.681
probably six
to seven months later.


438
00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.893
We figured that since
we hadn't heard anything


439
00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:41.729
from the SEC submission
in May of 2000,


440
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.231
we would try to blow the cover
off of this deal


441
00:24:44.232 --> 00:24:46.484
and push the SEC
into action


442
00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:49.153
by making it public.

443
00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:51.405
You know, I was trying to get
the media to pay attention.


444
00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:53.949
And the world doesn't know this,
but I went to Forbes.


445
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.119
I sent them 12 pages.

446
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.623
And we have a conversation,
and for some reason,


447
00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:02.791
their publisher
killed the story,


448
00:25:02.792 --> 00:25:03.792
didn't want to do it.

449
00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:21.644
I have a fear.

450
00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:23.812
I have a fear
of being mundane.


451
00:25:23.813 --> 00:25:25.689
I enjoy the challenge.

452
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.193
And consequently,
when I came across Madoff,


453
00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:30.986
it wasn't a big reach for us.

454
00:25:30.987 --> 00:25:33.322
It was to level
the playing field.


455
00:25:33.323 --> 00:25:35.074
It was the right thing to do.

456
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:36.408
Maybe you don't get
to become


457
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:38.410
the richest person
on Wall Street,


458
00:25:38.411 --> 00:25:40.246
but you can surely
sleep at night.


459
00:25:44.834 --> 00:25:47.002
It hurts to think
that I worked my whole life


460
00:25:47.003 --> 00:25:50.339
to retire and do things
that I want to do,


461
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.842
and these are the things
that were taken away from us,


462
00:25:53.843 --> 00:25:56.345
just culled out,
just taken away from us.


463
00:25:58.014 --> 00:26:00.015
As a young adult,
I always thought that,


464
00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:02.518
you know, going out and working
and doing the right thing


465
00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:03.852
and saving my money

466
00:26:03.853 --> 00:26:08.023
and sharing my life
with the woman that I love


467
00:26:08.024 --> 00:26:10.693
was the American thing
to do.


468
00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:14.196
And when...

469
00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:21.370
When Madoff happened,
it just took it away,


470
00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:25.207
stripped everything.

471
00:26:29.045 --> 00:26:31.380
Think on reflecting
what the American public feels.


472
00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:33.090
How are they supposed
to have confidence


473
00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.092
that if somebody goes to you
with a complaint,


474
00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:37.261
gives it to you
on a silver platter


475
00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:39.430
with all of the investigation,
with all of the numbers,


476
00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:41.515
with all of the data,
telling you exactly what he did,


477
00:26:41.516 --> 00:26:44.226
how he did it, and why he did it
and how he knows that,


478
00:26:44.227 --> 00:26:46.729
you don't know anything.

479
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.149
You're supposed to find it out
before it happens.


480
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.119
I was overseeing a conference
in Barcelona,


481
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:07.166
which we had started as we saw
the European market expanding.


482
00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:11.170
And Frank was attending
that conference.


483
00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:14.882
So we took a taxi together
to the hotel.


484
00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:25.809
Mike starts the conversation

485
00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.771
riding from the airport
to Barcelona with,


486
00:27:28.772 --> 00:27:31.607
"I'm an investigative reporter,

487
00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:33.609
"and I know most everyone
on Wall Street


488
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.777
"that's to be known-

489
00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:35.944
"surely every hedge fund guy

490
00:27:35.945 --> 00:27:38.197
because I write stories
on them."


491
00:27:38.198 --> 00:27:40.491
He said to me, "And I'll bet
you a steak dinner in Barcelona


492
00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:42.076
"that you don't know
every hedge fund.


493
00:27:42.077 --> 00:27:43.118
In fact, I bet you..."

494
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.536
"That I can give you a name

495
00:27:44.537 --> 00:27:46.872
that's running $3 billion
or more."


496
00:27:46.873 --> 00:27:48.540
Sure, I'll take that bet.

497
00:27:48.541 --> 00:27:50.042
And I said,
"It's Bernie Madoff."


498
00:27:50.043 --> 00:27:51.710
Well, his head
whipped around so hard,


499
00:27:51.711 --> 00:27:53.045
I thought it was
gonna come off.


500
00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:55.881
If that was true,
it was a story in and of itself.


501
00:27:55.882 --> 00:27:58.050
Nobody had ever heard
the name Madoff


502
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:02.054
mentioned in the same breath
as a money manager.


503
00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:15.526
So he bought me dinner
in Barcelona.


504
00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:16.694
Frank began to tell me

505
00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:19.029
not only is Madoff managing
a lot of money,


506
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:23.033
but he was adamant
that it has to be a fraud.


507
00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:25.536
Then he says,
"Frank, I'm going to write


508
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:26.995
"an investigative article
on it.


509
00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:28.997
I'm going to uncover
this guy."


510
00:28:28.998 --> 00:28:32.668
And then Mike became,
at that point in that cab ride,


511
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:38.340
the fourth group member
to try to hunt Madoff.


512
00:29:03.324 --> 00:29:07.161
Here we had a respected
senior investigative reporter


513
00:29:07.162 --> 00:29:08.829
from a major hedge fund
publication.


514
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.330
In fact,
it was the number one


515
00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:12.166
hedge fund publication
out there.


516
00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:14.001
Managed Account Reports,
that was it.


517
00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:16.336
Yeah, hi.
This is Mike Ocrant.


518
00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:18.297
He's on this case,
and he's on our team.


519
00:29:18.298 --> 00:29:20.132
And he writes an article

520
00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:22.259
that exposes this fraud
for what it is.


521
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.095
That should bring
the whole thing toppling down.


522
00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:29.516
Right.
Oh, okay.


523
00:29:29.517 --> 00:29:32.603
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.


524
00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:35.272
Well, we're gonna
figure that out.


525
00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:37.441
He's talking to
the derivatives professionals


526
00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:40.486
on Wall Street, and they all
said the same thing,


527
00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:41.945
"Madoff's not for real."

528
00:29:41.946 --> 00:29:43.447
Mmhmm. Mm-hmm.

529
00:29:43.448 --> 00:29:45.282
And so he's ready
to go to print,


530
00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:49.286
and then in April,
he gets that phone call


531
00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.455
from Madoff himself.

532
00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:58.587
We really don't know
who Bernard Madoff is.


533
00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:00.088
I think he was
so powerful,


534
00:30:00.089 --> 00:30:01.423
became so powerful,

535
00:30:01.424 --> 00:30:04.092
people were afraid
to challenge him.


536
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:10.390
White-collar fraudsters
always seduce you.


537
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:13.393
They have the best resumes,
went to the best schools,


538
00:30:13.394 --> 00:30:15.354
sit on all the right boards,

539
00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:17.022
have all the right
country club ties.


540
00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:19.191
They're political donors,
philanthropists.


541
00:30:19.192 --> 00:30:20.859
They live in
the best neighborhoods


542
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.528
in the nicest homes.

543
00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:23.862
You never suspect them.

544
00:30:23.863 --> 00:30:25.531
It's only afterwards,
in retrospect,


545
00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:27.199
that you see the evil
that they are


546
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.867
and the damage
that they cause.


547
00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:30.077
It's not the little guys.

548
00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:31.745
It's not the small firms
on Wall Street


549
00:30:31.746 --> 00:30:33.080
that cause the big problems.

550
00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:34.581
It's the big firms.

551
00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:35.874
It's the big predators

552
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:38.210
and big predators
like Madoff.


553
00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:40.546
I wasn't surprised

554
00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:42.256
that he necessarily agreed
to an interview


555
00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:45.300
because I had known Madoff
on and off throughout the years.


556
00:30:45.301 --> 00:30:47.970
This has nothing to do
with the institution, I believe.


557
00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:50.639
They spend too much time
thinking.


558
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.311
He was always known
as one of these rare people


559
00:30:56.312 --> 00:30:57.813
at that level
on Wall Street


560
00:30:57.814 --> 00:30:59.815
who would take calls
from journalists.


561
00:30:59.816 --> 00:31:01.316
They would deliver
an order.


562
00:31:01.317 --> 00:31:03.318
They now will own

563
00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:04.653
and you would see them...

564
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:11.577
I didn't go in, necessarily,
with suspicions.


565
00:31:11.578 --> 00:31:13.579
I went in really with,
you know,


566
00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:18.083
here is a number
of very serious questions


567
00:31:18.084 --> 00:31:20.586
people who are very
knowledgeable in the industry


568
00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:22.754
have about what you're doing

569
00:31:22.755 --> 00:31:26.592
and seeking a response
to those.


570
00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:36.059
Well, in layman's terms,
he was essentially buying stock,


571
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.561
buying options,

572
00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:40.731
betting that they would go up
on certain stocks,


573
00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.233
and buying options
on certain stocks


574
00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:45.235
betting that
they would go down.


575
00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:48.572
The basic concept
of Wall Street is,


576
00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:51.241
a person that is buying
a share of stock


577
00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:52.659
is convinced
he knows something


578
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.494
that the other person
who's selling it to him


579
00:31:54.495 --> 00:31:55.579
does not know.

580
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.914
The problem with it,

581
00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:59.750
you'd have to be
very, very, very accurate


582
00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:01.418
in picking the winners.

583
00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:04.546
It's jus-
it's humanly impossible, really.


584
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.262
Essentially he was saying,
"We've watched and helped,


585
00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:14.973
literally,
develop the markets in NASDAQ."


586
00:32:14.974 --> 00:32:16.475
Our firm,
for example, alone,


587
00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:19.186
we trade in excess
of $1 trillion a year.


588
00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:21.688
"We've got this
incredible reputation


589
00:32:21.689 --> 00:32:24.733
and knowledge
for using technology."


590
00:32:24.734 --> 00:32:27.819
What we did was totally
automate the process.


591
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.489
I think at one point, he said,
you know, "Give us some credit.


592
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.199
We've been in business
for 40 years."


593
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.034
Today's regulatory
environment,


594
00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:38.705
it's virtually impossible
to violate rules.


595
00:32:38.706 --> 00:32:40.874
My immediate impression
was just,


596
00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:44.503
you know,
"Here's a genuinely nice man."


597
00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:46.797
It's, "According to Madoff,
according to Madoff,


598
00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:47.965
according to Madoff."

599
00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:51.385
He's had perfect
market timing.


600
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:52.552
Bullshit.

601
00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:03.397
Hello.

602
00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:05.399
How are you?

603
00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:10.320
[man speaking indistinctly
over telephone]


604
00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:12.990
He sounded
like a whipped puppy dog.


605
00:33:15.118 --> 00:33:16.451
Yeah.

606
00:33:16.452 --> 00:33:18.286
He called me up,
and he said, "Frank..."


607
00:33:18.287 --> 00:33:19.496
So I got to tell you,

608
00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:22.666
this guy was just
so comfortable in his skin


609
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:27.462
and so unconcerned
and so responsive.


610
00:33:27.463 --> 00:33:29.297
Clearly, if you're
examining somebody


611
00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:30.924
where there
is the possibility of fraud,


612
00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:32.551
you can't take
that person's word for it.


613
00:33:32.552 --> 00:33:36.555
I said, "Mike,
go back to square one."


614
00:33:41.894 --> 00:33:43.729
And Mike says,
"You're absolutely right.


615
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.564
I'm gonna
write the piece."


616
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.570
He came out with
his investigative piece,


617
00:33:51.571 --> 00:33:53.405
Madoff Tops Charts.

618
00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:56.742
And it came out
on May 1st of 2001.


619
00:33:56.743 --> 00:33:58.243
Mike wrote a great article.

620
00:33:58.244 --> 00:34:00.746
It was scathing, scathing.

621
00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:04.082
When we saw it published,
we gave each other high fives.


622
00:34:04.083 --> 00:34:06.918
It was like, "Hey, Frank,
hey, Neil, it's over.


623
00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:08.086
It's over."

624
00:34:08.087 --> 00:34:09.921
You know,
"This thing is going down.


625
00:34:09.922 --> 00:34:11.465
Markets are going
to sell off."


626
00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:12.799
We said, "We got him.

627
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.093
This guy's going down."

628
00:34:15.094 --> 00:34:17.095
Six days later,
Barron's goes to print


629
00:34:17.096 --> 00:34:19.056
with Erin Arvedlund's
expose.


630
00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:21.349
This could finally be it,
you know:


631
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:25.520
Madoff exposed
in a Main Street publication.


632
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:27.189
The SEC's gonna
come riding in.


633
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.565
The posse's in town.

634
00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:31.485
You'd think that
the fund of funds reading this


635
00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:32.778
would have pulled out,

636
00:34:32.779 --> 00:34:34.905
that they would ask some
serious questions of Madoff.


637
00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:36.907
You know, you'd think
they'd have teams in there


638
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.076
the very next day
after these articles appear,


639
00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:40.744
and they don't do anything.

640
00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:42.579
They just don't care.

641
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.083
We waited a week, two weeks,
three weeks, four weeks,


642
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:47.793
and we started
getting nervous.


643
00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:54.800
You go to the movies.

644
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:57.469
You see the suspense-
drama thriller,


645
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.179
and you say, "Why don't they go
to the press?


646
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.388
"Why don't they go
to the press?


647
00:35:00.389 --> 00:35:01.890
"Why don't they
get it on a newspaper?


648
00:35:01.891 --> 00:35:03.225
That will end
this nightmare."


649
00:35:03.226 --> 00:35:04.559
Well, that's what we did.

650
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.394
And then you're saying,
"How powerful is he


651
00:35:06.395 --> 00:35:08.396
that the press
can't bring him down?"


652
00:35:08.397 --> 00:35:10.232
And so it was back
to the drawing board.


653
00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:12.400
So we, basically,
were going out


654
00:35:12.401 --> 00:35:14.402
and finding other investors,

655
00:35:14.403 --> 00:35:16.738
trying to figure out
where the money was coming from.


656
00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:18.740
It was the only safe way
for us to proceed.


657
00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:22.911
It was clear that the scheme
was getting much, much larger,


658
00:35:22.912 --> 00:35:24.579
and instead of $3 billion
to $7 billion


659
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.081
like we figured it was
the prior year,


660
00:35:26.082 --> 00:35:29.417
now it's $12 billion
to $20 billion.


661
00:35:29.418 --> 00:35:33.088
We, in our view, had almost,
like, a handbook


662
00:35:33.089 --> 00:35:34.422
that we had written

663
00:35:34.423 --> 00:35:39.094
on how the SEC should have
looked at the situation.


664
00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:44.724
I find it hard to believe

665
00:35:44.725 --> 00:35:49.104
that if anyone at the SEC
looked at the evidence,


666
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:51.439
how they could have
just dismissed it.


667
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.111
Maybe someone at the SEC
was paid to look the other way.


668
00:35:56.112 --> 00:35:58.780
I'm not participating
in the current examinations


669
00:35:58.781 --> 00:36:01.449
or investigations
due to the fact


670
00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:03.618
that a former employee

671
00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:05.287
who was under
my chain of command


672
00:36:05.288 --> 00:36:08.123
married a member
of the Madoff family,


673
00:36:08.124 --> 00:36:09.833
and I attended the wedding.

674
00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:11.960
When you first go into
the investigation, you think,


675
00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:13.837
"Wow, they missed all these
red flags that were obvious.


676
00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:16.339
Somebody may have been
paid off," you know,


677
00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.093
or, "Somebody was offered a job
and kept quiet."


678
00:36:20.094 --> 00:36:21.761
What percentage
of your employees


679
00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:24.097
in those two branches-
Enforcement and Compliance-


680
00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:30.770
leave the SEC and go to work
for a SEC-regulated entity?


681
00:36:30.771 --> 00:36:34.107
I think fewer people leave
the SEC than they used to,


682
00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:35.609
but when they do go,

683
00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.944
they often go to a regulated
entity in the Compliance area.


684
00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:41.948
Mr. Swanson was the lead
attorney on this case.


685
00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:46.453
He leaves the SEC,
marries Mr. Madoff's niece.


686
00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:47.787
Did you, for one minute,

687
00:36:47.788 --> 00:36:49.289
think that maybe
you should go back


688
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.292
and look at
how he handled that case?


689
00:36:54.253 --> 00:36:55.754
I probably
would have dropped it.


690
00:36:55.755 --> 00:36:59.424
You know, I did my duty
as a good citizen once,


691
00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:01.092
but Ed Manion said,

692
00:37:01.093 --> 00:37:04.095
"Harry, my agency
is thicker than a brick.


693
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:06.097
You just need
to keep trying."


694
00:37:06.098 --> 00:37:10.560
And so I resubmitted
in March 1, 2001.


695
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:14.397
So we're talking what,
ten months later?


696
00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:16.233
And the returns
were not outsized.


697
00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:18.568
I mean, there was
no flag there.


698
00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:22.072
Anywhere between, like,

699
00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:23.907
But I just thought,
"Well, that's, you know,


700
00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:25.075
"not gonna make me rich,

701
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:26.743
but it's gonna
keep my money safe."


702
00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:28.411
And that's kind of
how he always said:


703
00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:30.080
"You know, we're not gonna
make you rich,


704
00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:32.415
but your money
will be safe here."


705
00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:35.752
I left Rampart
in the end of '01.


706
00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:37.754
Harry was still struggling

707
00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:40.590
to meet the desires
of the owners of Rampart


708
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:41.758
and develop a product

709
00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:43.593
that Thierry
would actually invest in.


710
00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:45.595
Well, my firm had requested

711
00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:48.515
that I come out with a strategy
that could compete with Madoff.


712
00:37:48.516 --> 00:37:49.933
So I did.
I developed one.


713
00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:53.436
And it was a product that
had better returns than Madoff,


714
00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:54.771
but it was real.

715
00:37:54.772 --> 00:37:56.606
That was the big difference.

716
00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:59.776
But it was highly risky.

717
00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:02.612
Well, sure enough,
he got Thierry de la Villehuchet


718
00:38:02.613 --> 00:38:03.780
to look at it, and he said,

719
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.949
"Oh, I think the clients
might like that."


720
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:09.119
And then he took Harry
in 2002


721
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.621
to meet with probably

722
00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:33.935
Each conversation would start
with Thierry de la Villehuchet


723
00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:37.272
saying,
"Harry is just like Madoff,


724
00:38:37.273 --> 00:38:41.276
only higher risk,
higher return."


725
00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:46.990
The first bank said,
"Well, Harry,


726
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.825
"you know we have money
with Madoff,


727
00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:50.493
"and he never loses us money.

728
00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:51.828
You could lose money."

729
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.663
And every time they said that,
I was pissed.


730
00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:56.166
I was pissed off that they
would tell people that.


731
00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:58.168
"I'm nothing at all
like Madoff," I wanted to say,


732
00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.669
"You fools.
Madoff's a crook.


733
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.671
I'm legit.
I'm real."


734
00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:03.131
And they'd all tell me
the same story.


735
00:39:03.132 --> 00:39:04.215
They'd say...

736
00:39:04.216 --> 00:39:05.425
"Madoff's closed,
you know?


737
00:39:05.426 --> 00:39:07.093
"He's not accepting
any more money.


738
00:39:07.094 --> 00:39:08.595
"But we have a special deal
with him,


739
00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:11.598
and he accepts our money
and only our money."


740
00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:12.932
When you hear it
the first time,


741
00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:14.267
you sort of believe it.

742
00:39:14.268 --> 00:39:16.936
But when you hear it
time and time again,


743
00:39:16.937 --> 00:39:18.772
you know it's a Ponzi scheme,

744
00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:20.774
because what do we know
about Ponzi schemes?


745
00:39:20.775 --> 00:39:24.069
You need new money coming in
to replace the money going out.


746
00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:29.240
They were just basically
tentacles of an octopus.


747
00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:32.077
Their job was to raise money
for Bernie Madoff


748
00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:36.581
and yet keep the body
of the octopus hidden.


749
00:39:36.582 --> 00:39:38.249
He turns away customers.

750
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.085
He doesn't take all comers.

751
00:39:40.086 --> 00:39:43.088
You have to be graced by God
and graced by Bernie


752
00:39:43.089 --> 00:39:45.590
before he'll take you
into his scheme.


753
00:39:45.591 --> 00:39:48.093
And little did I know,
till the next day


754
00:39:48.094 --> 00:39:50.095
when Thierry de la Villehuchet
told me,


755
00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:51.846
that they had gone
to the polo fields,


756
00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:53.348
and I'm sure
that they were there


757
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:56.184
to make a marketing pitch
to Prince Charles


758
00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:58.186
to get assets for Bernie.

759
00:39:58.187 --> 00:40:01.022
And Thierry de la Villehuchet
made a pointed comment.


760
00:40:01.023 --> 00:40:03.858
He said, "Harry,
we would have invited you,


761
00:40:03.859 --> 00:40:05.693
but we didn't think
you knew how to curtsy."


762
00:40:05.694 --> 00:40:07.695
And I said,
"Thierry, I can do that.


763
00:40:07.696 --> 00:40:10.198
"It's pretty easy.
It looks pretty lame.


764
00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:11.533
"But I'm not gonna do that.

765
00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:12.617
"I'm an American.

766
00:40:12.618 --> 00:40:15.453
We don't bow to royalty."

767
00:40:15.454 --> 00:40:19.124
And it's pretty clear to me
that Madoff is bigger in Europe


768
00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:21.126
than he is in North America.

769
00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.097
As we moved to Paris

770
00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:36.766
and were going through
the Arc de Triomphe,


771
00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.560
and Thierry says,
"Look up there.


772
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:42.230
See underneath
Napoleon's name?"


773
00:40:42.231 --> 00:40:45.567
I'm looking at the names,
and I realize,


774
00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:49.904
"Hey, that's who
I'm meeting with in Europe."


775
00:40:49.905 --> 00:40:51.739
And I realized then,

776
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.116
it was royals
marketing to royals.


777
00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.742
And I thought that
was pretty astounding


778
00:40:54.743 --> 00:40:57.245
that these people were gonna
be drawn into the Madoff scheme.


779
00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.960
We realized that
this is global in scope.


780
00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:08.840
It's massive.

781
00:41:08.841 --> 00:41:10.675
And somehow
when you count dollars-


782
00:41:10.676 --> 00:41:12.177
and we were counting
the dollars-


783
00:41:12.178 --> 00:41:14.512
but when you see all the people
behind the curtain,


784
00:41:14.513 --> 00:41:16.514
that's when you get fearful.

785
00:41:16.515 --> 00:41:19.350
He had a lot of powerful people
helping him, behind him,


786
00:41:19.351 --> 00:41:21.352
that were standing to gain
a lot of money


787
00:41:21.353 --> 00:41:23.354
by keeping
the Madoff scheme going.


788
00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:24.856
And then you realize

789
00:41:24.857 --> 00:41:27.108
the truly epic proportions
of the scheme.


790
00:41:28.569 --> 00:41:31.237
When you look at who Madoff
was running money for,


791
00:41:31.238 --> 00:41:33.406
it was all offshore banks.

792
00:41:33.407 --> 00:41:36.409
And we know
that those monies are-


793
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.745
there's a percentage of I-
who knows how much-


794
00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:42.957
3%, 5% of the money
may be criminal money.


795
00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:44.626
That was dark money.

796
00:41:44.627 --> 00:41:48.129
That was offshore,
untaxed, dirty money.


797
00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.132
The other people that
love to use offshore accounts


798
00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:54.969
are drug cartels,
terrorists.


799
00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:57.972
So if Madoff is taking money
from organized crime,


800
00:41:57.973 --> 00:41:59.682
and he gets caught,
he's gonna be killed.


801
00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:03.186
So if he thinks
I'm gonna catch him


802
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.604
and turn him in
to the authorities,


803
00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:06.147
he has a lot of fear.

804
00:42:06.148 --> 00:42:07.398
Obviously, first of all,

805
00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:10.068
this conversation
never took place, okay?


806
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:12.737
When they did
an examination for us,


807
00:42:12.738 --> 00:42:14.239
they asked
all those questions,


808
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.074
which are standard questions.

809
00:42:16.075 --> 00:42:18.076
And the answers
that I gave them,


810
00:42:18.077 --> 00:42:20.912
which are the case,
are exactly what I'm giving you


811
00:42:20.913 --> 00:42:23.081
and basically what
you should respond to them.


812
00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:25.917
Obviously, not that-
we didn't have a conversation


813
00:42:25.918 --> 00:42:27.919
and all of this stuff,

814
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.712
The best thing to do
is not get involved with-


815
00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.756
that you send written
instructions, if possible,


816
00:42:31.757 --> 00:42:33.925
'cause any time you say
you have something in writing,


817
00:42:33.926 --> 00:42:35.093
they ask for it.

818
00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:37.095
So the best thing to do
is to say


819
00:42:37.096 --> 00:42:39.013
that it's a phone call.

820
00:42:39.014 --> 00:42:41.849
At this point,
Harry got nervous,


821
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:44.018
because Harry was the guy
out front with the SEC.


822
00:42:44.019 --> 00:42:45.687
So they knew his identity.

823
00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:51.693
[indistinct police radio
transmission]


824
00:43:02.705 --> 00:43:04.038
We were on our own.

825
00:43:04.039 --> 00:43:06.207
We had no idea
we were on our own.


826
00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:08.376
We had no idea
that the four of us


827
00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:10.878
were the last line of defense
between Madoff and his victims.


828
00:43:10.879 --> 00:43:12.880
Hell, we weren't even
the last line of defense.


829
00:43:12.881 --> 00:43:14.882
We were the only line.

830
00:43:17.553 --> 00:43:20.555
During the time that
we were developing strategies,


831
00:43:20.556 --> 00:43:22.724
one of the meetings,
I was down in Thierry's office,


832
00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:24.642
and I said, "Thierry,

833
00:43:24.643 --> 00:43:30.315
what happens if we're right
and you're wrong?"


834
00:43:30.316 --> 00:43:31.983
And he looked right at me,
and he said,


835
00:43:31.984 --> 00:43:35.653
"Frank, I have all of my money
in this manager."


836
00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:42.702
"I have most of my family money
in this manager.


837
00:43:42.703 --> 00:43:47.040
"I have half the royalty
of Europe in this manager.


838
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:50.543
"I have every private banker
in Switzerland and France


839
00:43:50.544 --> 00:43:53.296
"that I have cultivated
over my complete career


840
00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.297
"in this manager.

841
00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:56.466
"I cannot be wrong.

842
00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:59.218
If I am wrong,
I am a dead man."


843
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.643
What's happening here
is a travesty


844
00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:10.647
that I don't think anybody
can explain to somebody


845
00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.148
who hasn't lived through it.

846
00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:14.317
We lost our life savings.

847
00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:17.153
I worked.
I kept a beautiful home.


848
00:44:17.154 --> 00:44:18.821
I sold it.
I made a nice profit.


849
00:44:18.822 --> 00:44:20.657
I put it into Madoff.
It's gone.


850
00:44:20.658 --> 00:44:21.991
I could have just given

851
00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:25.328
the woman that bought my house
the key and said,


852
00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:26.996
"Here's a gift for you."

853
00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:30.124
And that's basically, in effect,
what happened to me.


854
00:44:33.962 --> 00:44:37.298
On December 17, 2002,

855
00:44:37.299 --> 00:44:41.469
Eliot Spitzer was appearing
at the JFK Library.


856
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:44.889
Now New York State
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.


857
00:44:46.225 --> 00:44:48.726
He was pretty much
a big-time fraud fighter.


858
00:44:48.727 --> 00:44:50.561
He was doing cases
against Wall Street


859
00:44:50.562 --> 00:44:52.563
that the SEC was
too afraid to do.


860
00:44:52.564 --> 00:44:54.565
Really, this is a debate
about the role


861
00:44:54.566 --> 00:44:57.235
government should play
in defining the boundaries


862
00:44:57.236 --> 00:44:58.986
of appropriate
business ethics.


863
00:44:58.987 --> 00:45:00.321
Defining what it means...

864
00:45:00.322 --> 00:45:02.990
I wanted to meet him
and pass off my documents.


865
00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:12.834
I didn't want anything
to prevent me


866
00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:15.169
from getting into that library
and seeing him.


867
00:45:20.426 --> 00:45:23.761
My wife was gonna deliver twin-
twin boys in about three months,


868
00:45:23.762 --> 00:45:25.096
a little over three months,

869
00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:26.764
and I had enough risk
on the table already


870
00:45:26.765 --> 00:45:28.099
with the SEC,

871
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.767
and so I didn't approach him
openly.


872
00:45:32.271 --> 00:45:35.523
As the event's ending,

873
00:45:35.524 --> 00:45:38.359
I put my gloves on,
and I pulled out the 9x12,


874
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.028
and I went over to the woman,
the JFK Library staffer.


875
00:45:41.029 --> 00:45:43.030
I said, "Eliot Spitzer,

876
00:45:43.031 --> 00:45:44.866
"the New York attorney general,
just spoke.


877
00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:48.202
Could you hand this envelope
to him?"


878
00:45:48.203 --> 00:45:50.705
And she made her way
over to him,


879
00:45:50.706 --> 00:45:52.915
and I made a beeline
for the door.


880
00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:55.251
I hotfooted it out of there
in the dead of night.


881
00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:58.921
And I always pack
light or heavy,


882
00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.423
depending on the situation,

883
00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:02.091
and that night
was a heavy night.


884
00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:22.236
When the twins were born
in 2003...


885
00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:31.621
I became more concerned

886
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:32.997
because the case
was dragging on,


887
00:46:32.998 --> 00:46:36.501
and the government
wasn't taking action.


888
00:46:36.502 --> 00:46:40.087
Seems there's no way for me
to stop Madoff with my team.


889
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.344
And so I'm very,
very worried,


890
00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:50.348
and I'm getting extremely
agitated and very nervous.


891
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:53.518
And it's a risky position
to be in.


892
00:46:57.189 --> 00:47:00.024
And I didn't appreciate that
the government put me there.


893
00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:08.991
I think Harry changed.

894
00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:10.493
First of all,
he was no longer happy


895
00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:11.994
being a portfolio manager

896
00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:14.163
because now he's found
so many people in the industry


897
00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:16.165
that are fraudulent
on this Madoff situation


898
00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:17.500
that he just says,

899
00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:20.503
"Hey, why am I playing
in finance?


900
00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:22.004
I mean,
these are all crooks."


901
00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:24.674
I found so much corruption
just in 2003,


902
00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.509
in the finance industry.

903
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.178
I said, "You know,
Wall Street's so corrupt.


904
00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:31.180
"I want to be on the other side
of this industry.


905
00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:33.516
I want to go against
these guys."


906
00:47:53.453 --> 00:47:55.454
So he just basically
got out of the industry.


907
00:47:55.455 --> 00:47:57.957
He virtually left
the industry.


908
00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:19.645
I met Gaytri at a Cambridge
Chamber of Commerce meeting


909
00:48:19.646 --> 00:48:21.188
in Massachusetts.

910
00:48:21.189 --> 00:48:22.356
She introduced herself.

911
00:48:22.357 --> 00:48:23.691
She said, "Hello.
I'm Gaytri..."


912
00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:25.526
"The Hindu goddess
of wisdom and knowledge."


913
00:48:25.527 --> 00:48:27.528
I thought, "Wow,
that's a weird introduction."


914
00:48:27.529 --> 00:48:31.032
I think that had
an impact on him.


915
00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:33.367
And I think it drew a smile
as well.


916
00:48:33.368 --> 00:48:34.410
Turns out she was

917
00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:35.995
an international
transaction lawyer,


918
00:48:35.996 --> 00:48:38.205
had been a Wall Street
deal attorney.


919
00:48:38.206 --> 00:48:40.541
He explained to me
that he had been


920
00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:43.377
to a bunch of law firms
to figure out


921
00:48:43.378 --> 00:48:48.382
how to do this business
of fraud investigation


922
00:48:48.383 --> 00:48:50.092
and to make money doing it.

923
00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:52.929
I was doing cases
on a contingency,


924
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.598
but I wasn't getting paid
any kind of an hourly rate.


925
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.767
We batted around
a few ideas,


926
00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:59.936
and he basically,
in five minutes, said,


927
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:02.104
"You're my lawyer."

928
00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.481
She would take a look
at my cases


929
00:49:03.482 --> 00:49:05.816
and help me negotiate the deals
with the attorneys


930
00:49:05.817 --> 00:49:07.318
that I was
placing these cases with.


931
00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:08.986
And they were typically
large cases,


932
00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.321
several hundred million
and up.


933
00:49:10.322 --> 00:49:12.657
Some were a few billion.

934
00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:15.785
He had already figured out
the fraud element.


935
00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:20.289
This is something that he seems
to instinctively gravitate to.


936
00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.589
I had left the firm
in October of '01.


937
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.759
About a year and a half later,
I helped draft Neil Chelo,


938
00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.595
Harry's assistant,
away from Rampart.


939
00:49:38.058 --> 00:49:43.062
I was traveling nonstop,
meeting hedge fund managers.


940
00:49:43.063 --> 00:49:45.898
It was very good
as far as me being able


941
00:49:45.899 --> 00:49:47.733
to get further intelligence

942
00:49:47.734 --> 00:49:50.236
and pass that on to Harry,

943
00:49:50.237 --> 00:49:53.739
who wanted to hear anything
related to Madoff.


944
00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:05.835
We would get an opportunity
to speak to risk managers


945
00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:09.672
who controlled risk at big banks
and brokerage firms.


946
00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:11.674
And I would occasionally
have conversations


947
00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:15.344
with these people and raise
some of the red flags.


948
00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:17.346
Some people took the hint,

949
00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:21.684
and others shunned what
we had to suggest and said,


950
00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.854
"Well, maybe, wink, wink,
nod, nod,


951
00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:27.857
"he's doing something
a little wrong,


952
00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:31.193
but he's our crook,
and he's paying us."


953
00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:33.279
Madoff was very clever.

954
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.115
The feeder funds were making
millions and millions


955
00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:38.200
and millions of dollars.

956
00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:40.870
They were taking probably
over 90% of the fee pie,


957
00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:43.873
and Madoff was keeping
the smallest piece for himself.


958
00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:46.333
And that's where Bernie
was a genius,


959
00:50:46.334 --> 00:50:49.170
in allowing everybody else
to participate in the fraud


960
00:50:49.171 --> 00:50:51.839
and not trying to garner it all
for himself.


961
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.759
The feeder funds
had no economic incentive


962
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.761
to turn Madoff in.

963
00:50:56.762 --> 00:50:59.221
They were making
too much money.


964
00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.389
Click!

965
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:02.725
And the commission
has no idea


966
00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:05.269
what the hell is going on.

967
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.438
Now, the reality of it is,
the stupidity of-


968
00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:09.440
and we answer those questions
all the time.


969
00:51:09.441 --> 00:51:11.400
Every time we get an exam.

970
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:14.904
And the issue that is-
our market making desk,


971
00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:17.615
the information that we get
from our orders is meaningless.


972
00:51:17.616 --> 00:51:19.116
The relationship
that we have


973
00:51:19.117 --> 00:51:21.285
has been an established
relationship for a long time.


974
00:51:21.286 --> 00:51:25.122
The commission knows
how we operate.


975
00:51:25.123 --> 00:51:28.626
And even if they act stupid
on a phone call with you,


976
00:51:28.627 --> 00:51:30.127
like, they're just trying
to find out


977
00:51:30.128 --> 00:51:31.462
all this information,

978
00:51:31.463 --> 00:51:33.756
they're full of shit.

979
00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:36.926
There were probably
many people on Wall Street


980
00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:39.595
that believed that Madoff
was a fraud


981
00:51:39.596 --> 00:51:42.264
but just walked away
and did nothing about it.


982
00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:43.933
I talked to people
at the big firms,


983
00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.392
people that I trusted,

984
00:51:45.393 --> 00:51:47.561
and they'd say,
"Harry, you're right.


985
00:51:47.562 --> 00:51:50.731
"Bernie Madoff
has got to be a fraud.


986
00:51:50.732 --> 00:51:54.568
"But I can't,
without my firm's permission,


987
00:51:54.569 --> 00:51:56.570
"join you at the SEC.

988
00:51:56.571 --> 00:51:58.405
If I do that,
I'll be fired."


989
00:51:58.406 --> 00:51:59.740
But they did say,

990
00:51:59.741 --> 00:52:02.743
"Look, you can have the SEC
contact me.


991
00:52:02.744 --> 00:52:05.079
"If they contact me,
my firm will cooperate


992
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.956
"because we're under
SEC jurisdiction.


993
00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.457
So they have to call me."

994
00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:09.542
And do you know what?

995
00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:12.211
The SEC,
they never made those calls.


996
00:52:14.047 --> 00:52:16.757
I was speaking with a fellow
maybe in his mid-40s


997
00:52:16.758 --> 00:52:20.094
at a financial institution
in Boston area,


998
00:52:20.095 --> 00:52:21.762
and as I stood up to leave,
he says,


999
00:52:21.763 --> 00:52:25.933
"What do you know
about Bernie Madoff?"


1000
00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:28.811
I said, "Who are you,
and why are you asking?"


1001
00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:33.482
He said,
"I married a woman


1002
00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:35.985
who's the sole heir
to a fortune."


1003
00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:44.910
"At the wedding,
Madoff came up to me afterwards


1004
00:52:44.911 --> 00:52:46.912
"and said,
'Now that you're family,


1005
00:52:46.913 --> 00:52:49.206
I'm gonna let you in
to my deal."


1006
00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:55.337
And he says,
"And I'm a financial guy.


1007
00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:58.340
"So I looked at the numbers
he was showing me,


1008
00:52:58.341 --> 00:52:59.675
"and I said,
'I don't understand


1009
00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:01.343
where he's getting
this return."


1010
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.681
He says, "For going on
two years now,


1011
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:07.850
"my father-in-law's
been calling me,


1012
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.853
'This is a great deal
for you and our daughter."


1013
00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.855
So he says,
"I need some ammunition.


1014
00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:16.692
You got to help me
beat my father-in-law."


1015
00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:19.195
So I went home that night,

1016
00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:22.031
and I started writing.

1017
00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:27.578
And I email it to "Abe,"
I'll call him.


1018
00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:30.247
And I didn't hear anything
from Abe.


1019
00:53:32.083 --> 00:53:33.918
We saved.
We saved for this future.


1020
00:53:33.919 --> 00:53:36.420
We never wanted to be a burden
to our children.


1021
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:38.088
And now
I wish I'd spent it.


1022
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:39.590
I wish I'd lived it up,

1023
00:53:39.591 --> 00:53:41.926
because all our life savings,
in a blink of an eye,


1024
00:53:41.927 --> 00:53:43.052
just poof, gone.

1025
00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:46.889
The average person
should be aware


1026
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.724
that when you get
a brokerage statement,


1027
00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.226
it's only a piece of paper

1028
00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:54.230
representing what
that person thinks they own.


1029
00:53:56.650 --> 00:54:00.402
October 29, 1929,
Black Tuesday.


1030
00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:02.905
The New York Stock Exchange
is in a panic.


1031
00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:04.740
Frantic investors
have scrambled


1032
00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:07.243
to unload their stocks
at any price.


1033
00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:08.744
Everyone wants to sell.

1034
00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:10.079
No one wants to buy.

1035
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.915
When you see something
that big in your industry,


1036
00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.583
if you don't do something
about it-


1037
00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:16.252
clean up your industry-

1038
00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:19.088
your industry is gonna suffer,
and we saw that.


1039
00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:22.591
And that's why our financial
system came near to collapse.


1040
00:54:22.592 --> 00:54:24.426
It was because
no one said anything.


1041
00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:26.095
They saw the frauds going on,

1042
00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.429
and everybody
remained silent.


1043
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:28.597
Well, that's just not my way.

1044
00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:29.765
I don't remain silent.

1045
00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:32.268
If I see a fraud,
I'm gonna stop it.


1046
00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:37.940
[distorted, indistinct
conversation]


1047
00:54:57.002 --> 00:54:59.336
It was clear that the scheme
was getting much, much larger.


1048
00:54:59.337 --> 00:55:02.339
So now we had

1049
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.175
And we'd expanded each of
the red flags dramatically.


1050
00:55:06.845 --> 00:55:09.513
I mean, you could have hired
an English major


1051
00:55:09.514 --> 00:55:12.683
who knew nothing
about finance,


1052
00:55:12.684 --> 00:55:14.685
given them the 29 flags,
and said,


1053
00:55:14.686 --> 00:55:17.521
"Pick three randomly,
go into Madoff's office,


1054
00:55:17.522 --> 00:55:19.481
and get the answers
to these three things,"


1055
00:55:19.482 --> 00:55:20.941
and they will uncover
the fraud.


1056
00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:25.821
We felt this was
the big last push.


1057
00:55:32.245 --> 00:55:35.414
And a few days later,
I'm meeting with Mike Garrity


1058
00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:37.166
and a few other people
from the SEC,


1059
00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:39.835
and it's clear
that Mike Garrity gets it.


1060
00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:41.503
He doesn't understand
the math,


1061
00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:44.840
so he has me diagram
every relationship.


1062
00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:48.510
And at the end of it,
he says,


1063
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.596
"Harry,
this is very serious,


1064
00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:52.848
"and it certainly merits me
forwarding it to New York


1065
00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:57.019
as quickly as possible
with the utmost seriousness."


1066
00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.688
On my submission,
I didn't want to be identified,


1067
00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:02.024
because if they know
and any of them turn out


1068
00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.026
to be corrupt
and take money from Madoff,


1069
00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:05.569
I'm a dead man.

1070
00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:09.448
We keep waiting and waiting.

1071
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:21.251
The commission knows
how we operate...


1072
00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:22.961
It was a road map
for the fraud,


1073
00:56:22.962 --> 00:56:24.463
and I'm just telling you,
"Go get it."


1074
00:56:24.464 --> 00:56:25.464
It's the case.

1075
00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:26.590
I already solved it for you.

1076
00:56:26.591 --> 00:56:28.092
All you have to do:
call my witnesses.


1077
00:56:28.093 --> 00:56:30.427
I gave you
their contact information.


1078
00:56:30.428 --> 00:56:31.762
And I'm also saying,

1079
00:56:31.763 --> 00:56:34.264
"How about if I offer
to go undercover


1080
00:56:34.265 --> 00:56:36.934
"and just go inside
the Madoff operation?


1081
00:56:36.935 --> 00:56:39.603
"If I do that,
I can ask a few questions


1082
00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:42.773
"and bust this thing wide open
in the space of an hour.


1083
00:56:42.774 --> 00:56:46.276
"Look at the math.
Check with a third party.


1084
00:56:46.277 --> 00:56:48.612
"All you have to do
is show up and ask a question,


1085
00:56:48.613 --> 00:56:50.614
and you'll get the answer
that solves the fraud."


1086
00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:51.949
They never showed up.

1087
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:52.991
What the hell's going on?

1088
00:56:52.992 --> 00:56:55.119
I was like the boy
that cried wolf,


1089
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.537
but there was a wolf.

1090
00:56:56.538 --> 00:56:58.789
It was never a false alarm.
I was always telling the truth.


1091
00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:00.332
There's the wolf.
It's Bernie Madoff.


1092
00:57:01.543 --> 00:57:03.210
Now, in this case,
you know,


1093
00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:06.422
Harry Markopolos provided
the complaint.


1094
00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:08.757
So he's the guy
who did have the experience.


1095
00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:10.092
But, unfortunately,

1096
00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:11.927
they didn't utilize him
the way they could.


1097
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:16.098
What the heck went on?

1098
00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:22.938
Your mission, you said,
was to-was to...


1099
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:28.986
Protect investors
and detect fraud quickly.


1100
00:57:28.987 --> 00:57:31.321
How did that work out?

1101
00:57:31.322 --> 00:57:33.198
What went wrong?

1102
00:57:33.199 --> 00:57:37.870
One guy with a few friends
and helpers


1103
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:41.874
discovered this thing
nearly a decade ago,


1104
00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:44.877
led you to this pile of dung
that is Bernie Madoff,


1105
00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:49.673
and stuck your nose in it,
and you couldn't figure it out.


1106
00:57:49.674 --> 00:57:53.510
You have single-handedly
diffused the American public


1107
00:57:53.511 --> 00:57:56.889
of any sense of confidence
in our financial markets


1108
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.557
if you are the watchdogs.

1109
00:57:58.558 --> 00:58:01.727
You have totally and thoroughly
failed in your mission.


1110
00:58:01.728 --> 00:58:03.729
Don't you get it?

1111
00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:14.990
I'm in New York now.

1112
00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:16.992
I'm in Madoff's turf.

1113
00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:19.203
He gets wind of this,
and I'm doomed.


1114
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.497
Me, personally,

1115
00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:24.333
I didn't feel
the safety issue.


1116
00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:25.834
We never felt that threat.

1117
00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.794
But I had been, personally,
on the receiving end


1118
00:58:27.795 --> 00:58:30.172
of such a threat
once in my business career...


1119
00:58:31.716 --> 00:58:33.342
When I inadvertently
was referred in


1120
00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:34.927
by a lawyer to the mob.

1121
00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:36.178
I want to tell you,

1122
00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:37.888
it's a horrible thing
to have to live under.


1123
00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:43.894
I rotted out 12 shirts
over a period of two months.


1124
00:59:06.584 --> 00:59:08.293
When you're dealing
with professionals,


1125
00:59:08.294 --> 00:59:09.586
you don't get the warning.

1126
00:59:09.587 --> 00:59:11.463
The first warning you get
is the flash of light.


1127
00:59:11.464 --> 00:59:12.548
And that's the first bullet

1128
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:14.049
that's gonna go through
your brain.


1129
00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.425
And it's usually gonna
be followed


1130
00:59:15.426 --> 00:59:16.510
by a second
within an inch.


1131
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:17.678
It's called double-tapping.

1132
00:59:17.679 --> 00:59:19.346
I was very familiar
with double-tapping.


1133
00:59:19.347 --> 00:59:20.931
I had a military background,

1134
00:59:20.932 --> 00:59:22.599
and I knew
what a double-tap was.


1135
00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:25.269
It's two bullets to the head,
either the front or the back.


1136
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:26.311
There's no warning.

1137
00:59:26.312 --> 00:59:27.354
It's just a flash of light.

1138
00:59:27.355 --> 00:59:28.855
Your brain
barely registers this,


1139
00:59:28.856 --> 00:59:30.857
and you're already dead.

1140
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.918
I could tell something
had spooked him.


1141
00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:53.922
He was very spooked, scared,
white as a ghost.


1142
00:59:57.844 --> 01:00:01.513
So he started mentioning
this thing about Ponzi.


1143
01:00:01.514 --> 01:00:03.348
I said to him, I goes,
"Are you that scared


1144
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:05.434
where you feel you might need
a bulletproof vest?"


1145
01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.936
I says,
"I have one right here."


1146
01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:13.984
We started talking about
carrying weapons.


1147
01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:16.695
I mean, this thing started
to mushroom to the point of,


1148
01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:20.115
you need self-protection.

1149
01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:23.452
What can a small little
department offer you, you know?


1150
01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.287
If nobody else
is believing you,


1151
01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.789
I mean, what's going on?

1152
01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.291
There are three things
you have to do


1153
01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.542
to survive
on the battlefield:


1154
01:00:30.543 --> 01:00:31.793
shoot, move,
and communicate.


1155
01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.629
The thing I was worried about
was the moving.


1156
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.422
This thing was gonna
prevent me from moving.


1157
01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:36.673
I didn't want him
to leave here


1158
01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:39.635
without any protection,
but it was his choice.


1159
01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:44.014
When he left that day-

1160
01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:47.017
and this kind of
sticks out in my mind-


1161
01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:49.853
he said, "When somebody
finally believes me,


1162
01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:53.357
"when I get the right agencies
to believe me,


1163
01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.192
"this isn't gonna be
just the biggest thing


1164
01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:56.693
"in the state
or the country;


1165
01:00:56.694 --> 01:00:58.528
"this will be the biggest thing
in the world


1166
01:00:58.529 --> 01:01:00.238
that anybody will ever see."

1167
01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:29.476
They did not live
a normal childhood.


1168
01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:31.978
They grew up
very, very protected.


1169
01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:34.648
There's the security system
over there.


1170
01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.149
And I had a newborn
about to come


1171
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:37.693
in April of that year.

1172
01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:42.197
Rah!

1173
01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.032
Everything was different.

1174
01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.867
Carrying a gun with you
is different.


1175
01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.077
And most people
don't do that.


1176
01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:50.247
That's not a normal
dad thing to do.


1177
01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.748
[speaking indistinctly]

1178
01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:53.250
We lived a different life.

1179
01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.252
There were places
we didn't go.


1180
01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:56.753
I liked to stay in state

1181
01:01:56.754 --> 01:01:59.131
because my pistol license
was only good for Massachusetts.


1182
01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:00.549
I needed to be armed.

1183
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.759
And you didn't know where
the ambush was gonna come from.


1184
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.885
You just knew
it was gonna be


1185
01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.595
a time and place
of their choosing.


1186
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.684
My kids probably think
my minivan


1187
01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.519
must leak a lot of fluids

1188
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.855
because I'm always underneath
the body carriage


1189
01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:18.692
checking it out for bombs.

1190
01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:21.194
Okay, guys.

1191
01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:22.362
Let's roll.

1192
01:02:22.363 --> 01:02:23.530
Harry first.

1193
01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.867
Have the window?

1194
01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:29.035
I didn't have
a normal lifestyle.


1195
01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:59.858
Fear is an amazing thing.

1196
01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.526
It gives you
a shot of adrenaline.


1197
01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:04.529
It gives you
the fight-or-flight response.


1198
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.199
[echoing] Flash of light,
flash of light...


1199
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.537
You're already dead...
Already dead...


1200
01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:14.039
You've reached
the point of no return


1201
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.459
where you can't stop.

1202
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.710
The easiest way out
is forward.


1203
01:03:18.711 --> 01:03:20.212
You can't go back

1204
01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:24.007
because you left too much risk
on the table.


1205
01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:36.353
If your security
wasn't good enough,


1206
01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:38.063
and if Madoff found out
about us,


1207
01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:39.523
I would have had
a decision to make,


1208
01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:40.899
and my decision
was pretty clear.


1209
01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.068
I'd go down and take out Madoff
before he took me out.


1210
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.778
I mean, I'd made
the conscious decision-


1211
01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:48.365
I was gonna go down there
and kill him.


1212
01:03:54.038 --> 01:03:55.705
I went to a whistleblower
organization:


1213
01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:59.334
Taxpayers Against Fraud
in Washington.


1214
01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.169
And they put me in touch
with John Wilke,


1215
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.004
a senior
investigative reporter


1216
01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.006
for The Wall Street Journal's
Washington bureau,


1217
01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:06.174
which was perfect for me.

1218
01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:07.843
Madoff would be focusing
to the south,


1219
01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.511
toward Philly or Washington,

1220
01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.304
thinking the whistleblower
is down there,


1221
01:04:11.305 --> 01:04:15.016
where I'm safe and sound,
hopefully, up in Boston.


1222
01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.352
There's this fellow
by the name of John Wilke,


1223
01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:20.730
and they call him
Mr. Front Page.


1224
01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:22.732
He was probably
the best investigative reporter


1225
01:04:22.733 --> 01:04:24.067
The Journal had.

1226
01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:25.402
I mean, he was that good.

1227
01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:27.404
A lot of stories he broke,
the people went to jail.


1228
01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:30.740
They were congressmen.
They were senators.


1229
01:04:30.741 --> 01:04:34.077
And Wilke is excited.

1230
01:04:34.078 --> 01:04:36.246
And he said,
"This is very interesting."


1231
01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:38.081
I said, "I have
a lot of documents."


1232
01:04:38.082 --> 01:04:39.916
The best thing to do
is not get involved...


1233
01:04:39.917 --> 01:04:42.252
He said, "Can you prepare me
some contact information


1234
01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:45.755
of other people I can contact
to verify the story?"


1235
01:04:45.756 --> 01:04:47.757
Harry says, "This guy's
going to do it.


1236
01:04:47.758 --> 01:04:48.925
"He's coming up,

1237
01:04:48.926 --> 01:04:50.427
"and he's going to write
the article,


1238
01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:51.970
"and it's going to go
on the front page


1239
01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:54.139
of The Wall Street Journal,"

1240
01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.145
I know that my only hope
for salvation


1241
01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:01.771
is The Wall Street Journal.

1242
01:05:01.772 --> 01:05:04.274
If they go to print,
I'm safe,


1243
01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:06.443
'cause Madoff
is gonna blow up.


1244
01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:09.613
If they don't go to print,
my life's forfeit.


1245
01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:13.241
Oh, I was in way too deep.

1246
01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.576
I couldn't give up
at this point.


1247
01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:20.206
My name's in New York.

1248
01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:24.377
The investigation's
off course.


1249
01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:27.714
The Journal has my story.

1250
01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:30.050
Wilke apparently
was reassigned


1251
01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:32.052
every time he wanted
to come up to Boston


1252
01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:34.387
to do the interviews
and work on the Madoff case.


1253
01:05:34.388 --> 01:05:36.723
And he made numerous plans
to come up and see me,


1254
01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.391
but someone higher up
at The Journal


1255
01:05:38.392 --> 01:05:39.893
killed the story.

1256
01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:41.061
It's a Pulitzer.

1257
01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:42.395
All a reporter had to say is,

1258
01:05:42.396 --> 01:05:44.230
"I want to cover it,
and I want to break Madoff."


1259
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:48.234
Every time we've tried
to uncover this Madoff fellow,


1260
01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:50.946
the investigations
are stymied.


1261
01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.739
I mean, we went to the biggest
and the best.


1262
01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:53.782
And that was it.

1263
01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:54.950
There was no luck.

1264
01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.117
They didn't care.

1265
01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.452
"Too unbelievable.
Too big.


1266
01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:58.703
"We don't do stories
that big.


1267
01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:01.456
We don't believe
it's for real."


1268
01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.166
And we don't know,

1269
01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:06.127
is there someone high up
in the government


1270
01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.463
that is actually
stopping this?


1271
01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.465
When the agency in charge
of the capital markets


1272
01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.800
doesn't do their job

1273
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:15.136
and when the press
doesn't do their job,


1274
01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:18.139
then where else do you go?

1275
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:23.144
So we became jaded,
if you will, disgusted.


1276
01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:26.982
By, I'm going to say,
somewhere around 2007,


1277
01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.316
we were almost giving up.

1278
01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:32.487
At that point,
I was, you know,


1279
01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:35.657
willing to drop it,
in my mind.


1280
01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.493
Harry was just obsessed.

1281
01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:41.162
Here I am, armed to the teeth
and checking for bombs.


1282
01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.497
And I need something
to happen.


1283
01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:44.416
I need Madoff to go down,
so I can live my life.


1284
01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:45.750
I want to return to normal.

1285
01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:52.132
I'm the point person.

1286
01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:55.468
My name's out there,
no one else's.


1287
01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:57.804
So I'm living in fear.

1288
01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.806
I'm afraid.

1289
01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:07.856
Harry, you okay?

1290
01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.108
Wake up.
Wake up.


1291
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:11.651
[whispering]
Okay, we got to be quiet.


1292
01:07:11.652 --> 01:07:14.529
We want to hear them
before they hear us, okay?


1293
01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.613
Okay, here.

1294
01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:16.948
You see all these
sticks here?


1295
01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:18.283
All these dead sticks?

1296
01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.952
If we step
on those dead sticks,


1297
01:07:20.953 --> 01:07:22.162
we'll scare the animals

1298
01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:23.747
because the stick will crack,
all right?


1299
01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:25.915
It will snap,
so we have to avoid that.


1300
01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:28.209
So you have to really make sure
you put your foot


1301
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:32.380
where the sticks are not,
okay?


1302
01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:35.550
That's it.

1303
01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:37.886
Here, now,
what do we have here?


1304
01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.387
Let me show you.

1305
01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:41.222
These are deer droppings.

1306
01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:42.390
Poop?

1307
01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:43.725
That's deer poop.
That's right.


1308
01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.060
Now here-
Don't step on it.


1309
01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:46.436
All right, now,
there's two types


1310
01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:47.937
of animals
in the woods here.


1311
01:07:47.938 --> 01:07:50.440
There's predators,
and there's prey.


1312
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.443
A deer is known
as a prey animal.


1313
01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:56.279
And there's predators like bear,
bobcat, and mountain lion


1314
01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.947
that would hunt these
and eat these.


1315
01:07:57.948 --> 01:07:59.407
To catch a predator,

1316
01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:00.742
you have to think
like a predator,


1317
01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.285
and you have to go
where they're going.


1318
01:08:02.286 --> 01:08:04.120
They're always looking
over their shoulder,


1319
01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:06.956
so you have to be very careful
when you sneak up on them,


1320
01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:10.460
'cause if they find out,
they could hurt you.


1321
01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.631
You understand that?

1322
01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:15.632
Yes.

1323
01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:16.800
- Good.
- Yep.


1324
01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:24.974
In retrospect, you know,
once my twins were born in 2003,


1325
01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.810
I should have stopped
the investigation.


1326
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:29.646
I was a fool
to keep going forward.


1327
01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:32.148
If the government didn't care,
why should I?


1328
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.984
But if you have
that attitude,


1329
01:08:34.985 --> 01:08:38.988
if citizens don't step forward
and contribute to society,


1330
01:08:38.989 --> 01:08:40.698
then society falls apart.

1331
01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:46.121
In 2008,
the world financial markets


1332
01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.956
really started
coming apart.


1333
01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.959
Investors around the world
were losing money on everything.


1334
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.460
There was no haven.

1335
01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:56.464
People were withdrawing
their money from fund of funds,


1336
01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:58.299
from the feeder funds.

1337
01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.801
So I need money
from somewhere.


1338
01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:00.969
I've got to get the money.

1339
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.804
Old Bernie,
Bernie never loses money.


1340
01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:05.473
We'll use Bernie
as our ATM.


1341
01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:09.310
He literally couldn't continue
the Ponzi scheme.


1342
01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.813
He ran out of money.

1343
01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.481
But it was nothing
that we did.


1344
01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:14.649
It wasn't the foxhounds.

1345
01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.484
It wasn't the team.

1346
01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.820
It was the marketplace.

1347
01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:21.322
So when Bernie
couldn't deliver,


1348
01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.825
he picked the time
of his own choosing


1349
01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:24.993
to say good-bye.

1350
01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:27.328
So how many documents
were destroyed?


1351
01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:29.497
How many cover-up stories
were built


1352
01:09:29.498 --> 01:09:32.667
before he decided
to call it quits?


1353
01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.708
I had no inkling
that anything


1354
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:16.628
was gonna change my life
that day.


1355
01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.963
Okay, guys, let's get ready
to go to karate.


1356
01:10:18.964 --> 01:10:20.131
Come on.
Get your stuff.


1357
01:10:20.132 --> 01:10:22.133
Let's go.

1358
01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:29.766
Go.

1359
01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:30.934
Both: Yah!

1360
01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:32.435
Come on.

1361
01:10:35.439 --> 01:10:36.898
Oh, nice.

1362
01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:41.569
I'm listening
to the voice mail,


1363
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:44.405
and it says, "Harry,
Bernie Madoff's been arrested.


1364
01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.407
"He's in federal custody,

1365
01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:48.034
"$50-billion Ponzi scheme.

1366
01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:49.244
"You're not gonna
believe it.


1367
01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.912
Congratulations.
You got him."


1368
01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:54.249
And so I knew that I needed
to get home as soon as I could


1369
01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.251
because I had one enemy
left to fight,


1370
01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:58.419
and that was the Securities
and Exchange Commission.


1371
01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.088
And I knew, back home,

1372
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:03.591
I had unprotected back there
lots and lots of documents


1373
01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:06.761
that would incriminate the SEC
to no end.


1374
01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:08.429
I knew that if the SEC
would try


1375
01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.932
to seize my computers
and documents that night,


1376
01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.267
there was gonna be
shooting.


1377
01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:15.603
And we had rehearsed
what I call a battle drill,


1378
01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:18.273
where if somebody did pierce
the premises,


1379
01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:21.276
I'd go down to the first floor
and confront the suspects.


1380
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.611
My wife would remain posted
at the top of the stairs.


1381
01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:25.613
Anybody coming up the stairs
that wasn't me,


1382
01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.782
she'd just keep shooting
until she ran out of ammo.


1383
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:31.911
I was gonna protect
those documents.


1384
01:11:31.912 --> 01:11:33.913
I knew they had
a lot to hide.


1385
01:11:33.914 --> 01:11:38.418
I just rushed into the house,
run upstairs to my office,


1386
01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:41.421
and I start collecting
documents.


1387
01:11:46.927 --> 01:11:52.140
So Harry is on the phone
very excited, very animated.


1388
01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:53.474
"What do I do?

1389
01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.977
"I have all this stuff.
I'm emailing it to you.


1390
01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.312
Can you safeguard it?"

1391
01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.648
And my immediate reaction
was that I was scared.


1392
01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:01.816
"Yes.
What do we do?"


1393
01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:03.318
She goes, "I don't know.

1394
01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.320
"I have to think about this.
This is big.


1395
01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.487
No one's ever done this."

1396
01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.656
And I said, "Yeah."

1397
01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:11.492
And so I was emailing documents
all through the night.


1398
01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.828
I didn't sleep because I knew
my risk factor was high.


1399
01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.496
I thought eventually
the SEC would know


1400
01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.081
that they needed
to move on my house


1401
01:12:17.082 --> 01:12:18.499
and get those documents
out of there


1402
01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.625
and seize my computers.

1403
01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:21.669
And I get a phone call,

1404
01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.338
"Are you Harry Markopolos?"

1405
01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.714
And I said, "Yes, I am.
Who is this?"


1406
01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.049
And he said,
"It's Greg Zuckerman


1407
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.508
"of The Wall Street Journal
calling.


1408
01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:29.177
Are you the Madoff
whistleblower?"


1409
01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.596
I said,
"You damn well know I am.


1410
01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:33.181
"You've had my stuff
for three years.


1411
01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.475
"You've been sitting on it.
You didn't do anything with it.


1412
01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:36.517
Of course I am."

1413
01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:37.727
"I just wanted
to confirm this


1414
01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:39.562
"because CNBC
is reporting the existence


1415
01:12:39.563 --> 01:12:40.730
of a Madoff whistleblower."

1416
01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:42.190
[announcer speaking
indistinctly]


1417
01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.691
And then the fear
went through me.


1418
01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:45.693
I said, "Oh, sheesh."

1419
01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.697
And he said, "Calm down.
Calm down."


1420
01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:52.450
"I'll work with you
on the story.


1421
01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:53.993
"Once your story is out,
you're safe.


1422
01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:55.703
Do you have any documents
you can send me?"


1423
01:12:58.248 --> 01:12:59.749
When Harry came in
that night,


1424
01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.918
he was completely
just out of his mind.


1425
01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:04.379
He was all disheveled,
very white,


1426
01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.881
frazzled, and he started-
he called me over.


1427
01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.216
He's like,
"I need to talk to you.


1428
01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.217
"I need to talk to you.

1429
01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.718
I need to borrow
a fax machine."


1430
01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:13.513
And I'm like, "For what?"

1431
01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:15.306
And he's like, "I have to get
these papers off.


1432
01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:17.100
"I have to get them
to The Wall Street Journal,


1433
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.434
"It's a matter
of life and death.


1434
01:13:18.435 --> 01:13:20.353
"I don't know-if something
might happen to me,


1435
01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:21.813
I have to get rid of these;
can you"-


1436
01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:23.356
he was going on and on
and on.


1437
01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:24.857
He points up to the TV,

1438
01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:27.026
'cause at that point,
we had the news on,


1439
01:13:27.027 --> 01:13:30.196
and it was-Bernie Madoff
had turned himself in.


1440
01:13:30.197 --> 01:13:31.572
He had information
and documents


1441
01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.908
that he had to fax over
right away


1442
01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:36.577
to a reporter for
The Wall Street Journal,


1443
01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:38.246
And so we're there
for 90 minutes


1444
01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.705
trying to fax
all these documents.


1445
01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:40.998
And we finally
get them through,


1446
01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:42.333
and I'm on the phone
with Greg Zuckerman.


1447
01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:44.001
He says, "Harry, I got
every last single one of them.


1448
01:13:44.002 --> 01:13:45.420
Thank you."

1449
01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:46.838
Wall Street veteran
Bernie Madoff


1450
01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.381
has been arrested
and charged with...


1451
01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:49.590
His name is Bernard Madoff,

1452
01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.217
The SEC accusing
Bernard Madoff...


1453
01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:53.136
And Greg Zuckerman's
working the story hard.


1454
01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:54.429
He's calling me up.

1455
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.431
And he goes, "Are you sure
you're for real?"


1456
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.099
And I said,
"Why are you asking?"


1457
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.143
And he said, "Cause this stuff
is too good to be true.


1458
01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:01.436
"You're telling me
you gave this


1459
01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.812
to the government,
and they did nothing?"


1460
01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:04.605
And I said, "Yeah,
you're talking about weeks


1461
01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:05.773
"and months and years,

1462
01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.358
hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of hours."


1463
01:14:07.359 --> 01:14:08.943
And that was sort of
the stumbling block


1464
01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.278
for the first few days.

1465
01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.280
He couldn't believe
that my stuff was that good,


1466
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.281
and the SEC ignored it.

1467
01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:14.449
He just couldn't fathom

1468
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.117
how it could go over
their heads like that.


1469
01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.119
He never figured it out,
until...


1470
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.789
I was very concerned
to learn this week


1471
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:25.626
that credible allegations
about Mr. Madoff


1472
01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:29.130
had been made
over nearly a decade


1473
01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:33.468
and yet never referred to
the commission for action.


1474
01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:34.802
"Mea culpa.

1475
01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:36.137
"We had known about this case.

1476
01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.139
"We had credible
and specific warnings


1477
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.640
"for a period
of at least a decade


1478
01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.142
"that we didn't pay
any attention to.


1479
01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.477
"Our staff failed miserably.

1480
01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.687
"They never brought this
to the commission's attention


1481
01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:46.230
"for any action.

1482
01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:48.065
"I've tasked the SEC's
inspector general


1483
01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:50.067
to launch an immediate
investigation."


1484
01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:52.069
And at that point,
at that instant in time,


1485
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:53.905
as soon as
that was released,


1486
01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:56.157
The Wall Street Journal
believed everything I said.


1487
01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:01.537
The press was relentless.

1488
01:15:01.538 --> 01:15:03.873
There was constant requests
coming in.


1489
01:15:03.874 --> 01:15:05.208
And I just had to ignore them

1490
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:07.877
because I was being invited
to testify


1491
01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:10.713
before the House
Capital Markets Subcommittee.


1492
01:15:10.714 --> 01:15:12.548
And I had already
been told that I was,


1493
01:15:12.549 --> 01:15:14.550
and I'd gotten contacted
by the SEC's IG.


1494
01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:18.221
We wanted to understand
from his perspective


1495
01:15:18.222 --> 01:15:20.431
how his interactions
with the SEC were.


1496
01:15:20.432 --> 01:15:22.350
"We want to make sure
we get the accurate story.


1497
01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:23.643
Can you help us, Harry?"

1498
01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:25.645
I said, "Sure, Mr. Kotz,
I'd be happy to help you."


1499
01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.532
The night that Bernie blew,
my phone rang.


1500
01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:39.951
Beep!

1501
01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.118
Hey. Hi.

1502
01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:42.453
How you doing, Harry?

1503
01:15:42.454 --> 01:15:43.788
And he said, "Madoff blew.

1504
01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.623
"We were right.
We're vindicated."


1505
01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:47.708
What?
You're kidding me.


1506
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:49.544
My second cell phone rings.

1507
01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:51.212
Hold on.
My other line's ringing.


1508
01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:54.715
Hold on.

1509
01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:57.051
Michael, I got Harry
on the other line.


1510
01:15:58.053 --> 01:15:59.554
Then my house phone rings,

1511
01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.722
and my wife says,
"It's a business call.


1512
01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.559
And he won't
identify himself."


1513
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.894
And it was Abe.

1514
01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:13.901
And Abe said,
"Are you talking to Harry?"


1515
01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.736
And I said, "Yes."

1516
01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:19.240
He says, "Well, first of all,
I want to tell you guys,


1517
01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:20.575
"I want to thank you,

1518
01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:23.411
and I want you to convey this
to Harry and Mike."


1519
01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:27.748
He says, "Thank you for
your efforts for nine years.


1520
01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.917
"And thank you, personally,
Frank,


1521
01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:31.919
for trying to save
my butt."


1522
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.921
I said, "Well,
what happened, Abe?"


1523
01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:37.592
He said, "I read it to my father
word for word,


1524
01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.427
my father-in-law."

1525
01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:43.431
And he said, "The man sat down,
and he said,


1526
01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.933
"This is incredulous.

1527
01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:48.269
"I can't believe it.

1528
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.271
"Bernie's been
a friend for life.


1529
01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:51.606
"I don't believe it.

1530
01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.107
"I won't believe it.

1531
01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:56.110
"Bernie would never do this
to us.


1532
01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:57.945
"Your guy has it wrong.

1533
01:16:57.946 --> 01:17:00.114
"He probably did his research,
but he's off base.


1534
01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:01.616
He's wrong."

1535
01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:04.619
He says,
"We just lost everything."


1536
01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:08.122
I said,
"Abe, I'm so sorry."


1537
01:17:14.254 --> 01:17:15.755
Madoff is expected
to plead guilty


1538
01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:19.800
to ripping off investors
to the tune of $50 billion.


1539
01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:23.804
He surrendered because
he had made too many enemies


1540
01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.264
in too many
different countries.


1541
01:17:25.265 --> 01:17:27.099
To steal billions
and billions of dollars,


1542
01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.769
it has to take
a very special kind of person.


1543
01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.605
He had no place to run,
no place to hide.


1544
01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:33.939
He'll never get it.

1545
01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:35.608
He really will never get it.

1546
01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:37.610
For him,
it's all about money.


1547
01:17:42.532 --> 01:17:44.700
He didn't mount a defense
in court.


1548
01:17:44.701 --> 01:17:47.203
He just copped
a guilty plea.


1549
01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:50.039
And he went down
without talking.


1550
01:17:55.420 --> 01:18:00.424
As the news came out,
we were just overly shocked.


1551
01:18:00.425 --> 01:18:02.259
We never conceived
that an investor


1552
01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.428
could come in directly to Madoff
and invest.


1553
01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:06.430
That's just not the way
Wall Street works.


1554
01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:08.432
Everybody's a victim
of their training,


1555
01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:10.101
and we were
institutionally trained.


1556
01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:11.602
And so we had blinders on,

1557
01:18:11.603 --> 01:18:13.771
and we totally missed
the individual angle, totally.


1558
01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:15.606
Totally missed it.

1559
01:18:15.607 --> 01:18:19.402
These people typically
went all in, 100%.


1560
01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:22.530
So the individual investors
oftentimes just got wiped out.


1561
01:18:25.283 --> 01:18:29.537
Tens of thousands of victims
were damaged beyond repair


1562
01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.038
for no other reason

1563
01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.873
than putting their trust
in the wrong person.


1564
01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:36.210
The man had no need
to take down charities.


1565
01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:39.213
He had no need
to take down people.


1566
01:18:41.758 --> 01:18:44.593
And for that, the man
ought to burn in hell.


1567
01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:57.898
And, of course,
we came on a sad postscript.


1568
01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:01.777
After Bernie Madoff
imploded...


1569
01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:36.437
Police discovered Rene Thierry
Magon de la Villehuchet


1570
01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:39.356
dead in his Manhattan office
early Tuesday.


1571
01:19:39.357 --> 01:19:40.858
7:00 in the morning,
I believe,


1572
01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:42.359
an employee was not able
to get in,


1573
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.529
asked security to go up
and open the door.


1574
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:47.531
Security did go up
and open the door,


1575
01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:50.701
and they found the man
at his desk.


1576
01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:52.703
Police say
he committed suicide,


1577
01:19:52.704 --> 01:19:54.205
They say both wrists were...

1578
01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:55.539
He took some painkillers.

1579
01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:56.791
He took a box cutter.

1580
01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.959
He cut his arms like this.

1581
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.129
He stuck them into a trash can
and bled out.


1582
01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.799
He wrote, apparently,
a note that said,


1583
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.135
"I understand that
if you fail your friends,


1584
01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:12.139
your clients, then you must
face the consequences."


1585
01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.475
It's out of fashion today,

1586
01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:16.268
but that's the way
noble people go out.


1587
01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:19.855
And he made a horrible mistake,
and it cost him his life.


1588
01:20:22.275 --> 01:20:26.111
I thought he committed suicide
because he was wiped out.


1589
01:20:26.112 --> 01:20:29.615
I've come to find out

1590
01:20:29.616 --> 01:20:32.451
that that probably
wasn't the reason.


1591
01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:39.333
We had warned Thierry
and his senior staff,


1592
01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.001
and they ignored
our repeated warnings,


1593
01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.169
and now we know why.

1594
01:20:46.383 --> 01:20:48.717
Bernie was paying top dollar
for new victims,


1595
01:20:48.718 --> 01:20:51.387
and so he got
lots of new victims.


1596
01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:56.684
If one believes that

1597
01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.519
it's an old man and a dog
in a back room


1598
01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:03.190
that perpetrated this fraud,
then they're very naive.


1599
01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:06.694
No man could build
this empire alone.


1600
01:21:08.321 --> 01:21:11.824
He set up, effectively,
an infrastructure


1601
01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:17.329
where people were doing
all his dirty work for him.


1602
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:18.831
And he had his capos,

1603
01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:21.375
and he had his lieutenants,
and he had his soldiers.


1604
01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.210
And they were all out there
in the feeder funds


1605
01:21:23.211 --> 01:21:24.837
and the fund of funds,
doing his bidding.


1606
01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:27.172
There were multiple
feeder funds set up,


1607
01:21:27.173 --> 01:21:30.342
not only in the U.S.,
all around the world.


1608
01:21:30.343 --> 01:21:31.719
They took the money,

1609
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.679
and now they're trying
to get away with the money,


1610
01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.347
and we shouldn't let them
get away with it.


1611
01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:36.390
They need to be in prison.

1612
01:21:38.101 --> 01:21:40.269
The government's out there
chasing terrorists,


1613
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.104
and the financial terrorists
are getting away


1614
01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:44.231
with financial murder.

1615
01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:46.567
I don't have billions
of dollars.


1616
01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:48.235
I don't live in a mansion.

1617
01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:50.738
I don't own any property
in the Bahamas.


1618
01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.073
And I'm like you.
I am you.


1619
01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:57.870
'Cause they didn't just
take money from us.


1620
01:21:57.871 --> 01:21:59.705
Bernie Madoff took away
part of our real lives.


1621
01:21:59.706 --> 01:22:01.373
The plans, the hopes,
the dreams


1622
01:22:01.374 --> 01:22:03.208
for what we were going to do
in retirement


1623
01:22:03.209 --> 01:22:05.210
are shambles
at this stage.


1624
01:22:05.211 --> 01:22:06.378
They'll never be recovered.

1625
01:22:06.379 --> 01:22:08.088
There's not enough time left.

1626
01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:10.424
If it happened to me,
it could happen to you.


1627
01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:11.926
This all
could have been stopped


1628
01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.761
if the Securities
and the Exchange Commission


1629
01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:14.929
had done their job.

1630
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.931
When you lose confidence
in anything-


1631
01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:19.600
and God forbid we lose
confidence in the U.S. dollar-


1632
01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:23.437
the repercussion
is going to be horrendous.


1633
01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:26.357
We meet today to continue
our review


1634
01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:29.193
of the $50-billion
Ponzi scheme


1635
01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:32.446
allegedly perpetrated
by Mr. Bernard Madoff.


1636
01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:35.783
And we are pleased to have
Mr. Harry Markopolos.


1637
01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.034
I was pissed.

1638
01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:38.369
I was so angry
at what they did.


1639
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:40.204
I was eight and a half years
their doormat,


1640
01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:41.789
and I finally get a chance
to shoot back.


1641
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.457
Well, hell, I'm gonna do
a lot of shooting.


1642
01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:46.794
Mr. Markopolos,
it's all yours.


1643
01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.629
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1644
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:49.964
Good morning.

1645
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.256
Thank you
for inviting me here


1646
01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:53.092
to testify before
your committee today


1647
01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:55.135
regarding my nine-year-long
investigation


1648
01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:57.471
into the Madoff
Ponzi scheme.


1649
01:22:57.472 --> 01:22:59.139
I gift wrapped
and delivered


1650
01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.308
the largest Ponzi scheme
in history to them,


1651
01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:03.477
and somehow
they couldn't be bothered


1652
01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.813
to conduct a thorough
and proper investigation


1653
01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:09.316
because they were too busy
on matters of higher priority.


1654
01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:11.318
If a $50-billion Ponzi scheme

1655
01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:13.320
doesn't make the SEC's
priority list


1656
01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:15.823
then I want to know
who sets their priorities.


1657
01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.826
The current staff has led
our nation's financial system


1658
01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.160
to the brink of collapse.

1659
01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:22.621
The SEC is also captive
to the industry.


1660
01:23:22.622 --> 01:23:25.124
The SEC continues
to roar like a mouse


1661
01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.792
and bite like a flea.

1662
01:23:26.793 --> 01:23:28.460
They haven't earned
their paychecks,


1663
01:23:28.461 --> 01:23:29.795
and they need
to be replaced.


1664
01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:31.296
This concludes
my oral testimony.


1665
01:23:31.297 --> 01:23:32.923
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1666
01:23:32.924 --> 01:23:35.342
Thank you very much,
Mr. Markopolos.


1667
01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:39.555
We're delighted with your
willingness to come forward.


1668
01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:41.557
We thank you for that.

1669
01:23:41.558 --> 01:23:43.392
We want to work
with you closely


1670
01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:46.395
as we move on
toward regulatory reform.


1671
01:23:46.396 --> 01:23:48.397
I would like to just say,
for the record,


1672
01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:52.026
that I see you
as a modern-day Greek hero.


1673
01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.945
You've done your country
a great service.


1674
01:23:54.946 --> 01:23:56.405
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1675
01:23:56.406 --> 01:23:57.990
It's been a singular honor.
Thank you.


1676
01:23:57.991 --> 01:23:59.491
Thank you very much.

1677
01:24:00.577 --> 01:24:02.244
Well, the goal
was to tear down the SEC


1678
01:24:02.245 --> 01:24:03.579
and take them
to the lowest point


1679
01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.747
in their 75-year history

1680
01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:06.081
so that they could rebuild.

1681
01:24:06.082 --> 01:24:07.916
So, yeah, I wanted to hold
the SEC accountable.


1682
01:24:07.917 --> 01:24:09.084
I was damn angry.

1683
01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:10.919
I wanted to make that clear
to that agency,


1684
01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:13.047
that they were a total,
miserable failure.


1685
01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:15.215
In the SEC, I don't think

1686
01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:18.886
anybody's been held accountable
personally there.


1687
01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.889
Several people
have been allowed to resign.


1688
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.265
I think
that wasn't good enough.


1689
01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:26.143
I think they should have been
fired and disgraced.


1690
01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:28.979
They are systemically
incompetent,


1691
01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.815
not qualified
to hold those jobs.


1692
01:24:33.985 --> 01:24:36.820
And the SEC was really mad.

1693
01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:43.327
Lots of crooks that are gonna
be under arrested in the SEC.


1694
01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:45.829
They're not sure
what to make of it.


1695
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:48.999
The twins think that
Madoff was a bank robber


1696
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.668
and I stopped him
and I caught him,


1697
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:53.504
which is not what happened.

1698
01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:56.673
And-but that's what
a six-year-old understands.


1699
01:24:56.674 --> 01:24:58.842
My dad is my hero.

1700
01:24:58.843 --> 01:25:00.844
And they see people
come up to me in restaurants


1701
01:25:00.845 --> 01:25:03.013
and shake my hand
and tell me that I'm a hero,


1702
01:25:03.014 --> 01:25:05.015
which...

1703
01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:06.600
I'm no hero.

1704
01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:10.104
So they're not sure
what to make of it.


1705
01:25:12.982 --> 01:25:14.983
I don't compare very well
to Spider-Man,


1706
01:25:14.984 --> 01:25:17.486
who they really love.

1707
01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:20.489
So I think 10, 15 years
down the road,


1708
01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:22.324
they'll understand.

1709
01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:34.294
Today we're in Las Vegas

1710
01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:36.964
for the Association
of Certified Fraud Examiner's


1711
01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:39.174
20th Annual Fraud Conference.

1712
01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:47.391
And it is the premier event
of the year for fraud examiners.


1713
01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:56.316
Each annual conference,

1714
01:25:56.317 --> 01:26:00.487
our CFE of the Year award
is presented to a CFE


1715
01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:03.323
who has demonstrated
outstanding achievement


1716
01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:05.325
in the field
of fraud examination.


1717
01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:12.541
He's receiving this award
because he has demonstrated


1718
01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:16.378
the character,
the quality that we expect


1719
01:26:16.379 --> 01:26:18.505
out of a certified
fraud examiner.


1720
01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:26.889
To say he was the obvious choice
is an understatement.


1721
01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:31.935
Ladies and gentlemen,

1722
01:26:31.936 --> 01:26:33.437
it is my privilege
to present to you


1723
01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.647
Mr. Harry Markopolos.

1724
01:26:52.415 --> 01:26:54.917
I feel that
I'm a $65-billion failure.


1725
01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:58.086
My name is next
to that failure.


1726
01:26:58.087 --> 01:27:00.422
It's a bit harsh,
but it's true.


1727
01:27:00.423 --> 01:27:02.591
We didn't save anybody.

1728
01:27:04.427 --> 01:27:06.929
I think part of the reason
he takes it personally is,


1729
01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:11.934
he tried so hard
for so long.


1730
01:27:11.935 --> 01:27:14.937
I mean, I don't know what else
Harry could have done.


1731
01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.525
You know, I feel like a fraud
getting this award.


1732
01:27:20.526 --> 01:27:22.236
I just don't think
I'm worthy.


1733
01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.406
I was pretty depressed.

1734
01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:29.493
I mean, this was
the largest case in history.


1735
01:27:34.707 --> 01:27:37.709
It was nothing
but a massive failure.


1736
01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:42.839
I was holding myself
responsible.


1737
01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.264
People call you a hero.
I just don't like that.


1738
01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:52.432
I just feel if you're doing
what you're supposed to do,


1739
01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:54.434
that's your duty.
