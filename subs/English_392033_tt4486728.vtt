1
00:04:42.102 --> 00:04:44.947
Love?

2
00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:47.524
I have a surprise for you.

3
00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:50.068
I think you'll enjoy it.

4
00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:52.788
I saw Luke playing
soccer in the street,


5
00:04:52.988 --> 00:04:57.159
so I think that...
we we are alone now.


6
00:04:57.359 --> 00:04:59.294
Just the two of us, love.

7
00:04:59.494 --> 00:05:02.956
This food is with a great smell.

8
00:05:07.627 --> 00:05:08.929
Hey.

9
00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.031
Why, isn't it lovely?

10
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:13.133
Go ahead, pull.

11
00:05:15.427 --> 00:05:17.137
Love, go out, right now.

12
00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:19.556
It will be right there, love.

13
00:05:22.225 --> 00:05:24.478
Sit down soon.

14
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:27.731
She has nothing to do
with that, Jenkins.


15
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:29.741
She has everything to do with it.

16
00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:36.656
My wife, my son, my life,
you took it all from me.


17
00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:38.637
What you want?

18
00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:40.419
What I want?

19
00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:42.329
How about a cancer cure?

20
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:49.428
I'm dying, detective.

21
00:05:49.628 --> 00:05:51.926
I will die alone and cold.

22
00:05:52.126 --> 00:05:54.424
And I want you know how it is.

23
00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:57.144
What are you, a ninja?

24
00:05:57.344 --> 00:06:00.180
Keep getting closer,
I won't talk again.


25
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.557
Please turn around and leave.

26
00:06:02.757 --> 00:06:03.817
No one needs to get hurt.

27
00:06:04.017 --> 00:06:07.354
Really? No one needs to get hurt?

28
00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:12.025
How about if I hurt this...

29
00:08:54.312 --> 00:08:56.648
Yes I'm already going.

30
00:09:04.197 --> 00:09:06.199
Captain.

31
00:09:19.045 --> 00:09:21.131
No thank you.

32
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.927
I called on your cell phone.

33
00:09:26.127 --> 00:09:28.388
And it's off.

34
00:09:28.588 --> 00:09:30.807
And it is.

35
00:09:32.392 --> 00:09:35.687
How you doing, partner?

36
00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:38.189
Living the dream.

37
00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:45.405
Any plans for Thanksgiving?

38
00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:47.824
You are looking at him.

39
00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:52.537
How is Luke doing?

40
00:09:53.079 --> 00:09:55.415
Look, I appreciate
that have come but...


41
00:09:55.615 --> 00:09:57.751
I'm fine.

42
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.755
Why no longer appears
late to see the game?


43
00:10:01.955 --> 00:10:04.865
I bought a brand new TV 70 inch.

44
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.990
It will be great.

45
00:10:06.992 --> 00:10:09.804
And you know Irene
cooks very well.


46
00:10:10.388 --> 00:10:12.641
Yeah, maybe.

47
00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:18.021
Hard to believe, that
it's been five years.


48
00:10:27.614 --> 00:10:29.537
The game starts at 1am.

49
00:10:29.737 --> 00:10:31.460
See if it appears, man.

50
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.995
Happy Thanksgiving, Captain.

51
00:12:14.812 --> 00:12:16.036
Ricky?

52
00:12:16.681 --> 00:12:18.233
Dear?

53
00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:20.151
Are you there?

54
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:22.529
It's just me again.

55
00:12:22.729 --> 00:12:26.191
I would like very
much that you answer.


56
00:12:26.858 --> 00:12:30.987
Anyway, the turkey will get
ready in the early evening,


57
00:12:31.187 --> 00:12:33.748
We'd love to have you here.

58
00:12:33.948 --> 00:12:37.035
I know of a right someone
who misses you so much.


59
00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:38.235
Grandma has arrived.

60
00:12:38.328 --> 00:12:39.621
We can eat. We can eat.

61
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:40.839
So please,

62
00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:43.416
At least try, right?

63
00:12:43.616 --> 00:12:45.188
My first turkey.

64
00:12:45.388 --> 00:12:46.961
Not bad, is it?

65
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.515
Ricky?

66
00:12:50.715 --> 00:12:52.684
Love?

67
00:12:52.884 --> 00:12:55.845
Okay bye.

68
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.734
There's nothing in these cans.

69
00:13:10.568 --> 00:13:13.696
Some's trash is
treasure of others.


70
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.660
On here.

71
00:13:19.744 --> 00:13:21.421
Oh no. I'm fine.

72
00:13:21.621 --> 00:13:23.923
Well I need to leave
so can you go?


73
00:13:24.123 --> 00:13:26.376
I bet it goes on
Somewhere important.


74
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.960
What?

75
00:13:28.127 --> 00:13:30.096
I used to be always in a hurry,

76
00:13:30.296 --> 00:13:33.658
always running, never
stopped to enjoy


77
00:13:33.858 --> 00:13:37.220
what the good God
put under our nose.


78
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.848
And how has it worked for you?

79
00:13:41.099 --> 00:13:42.776
Family program?

80
00:13:42.976 --> 00:13:44.477
I really can't with that.

81
00:13:44.677 --> 00:13:45.779
Not today.

82
00:13:45.979 --> 00:13:48.356
Today is Thanksgiving.

83
00:13:49.023 --> 00:13:53.027
A young man like you
should be in family.


84
00:13:53.227 --> 00:13:55.864
Looks like you have much to thank.

85
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.493
Looks like you have
thank you very much.


86
00:14:17.135 --> 00:14:21.931
It's a beautiful day, I'm
alive, and God is good.


87
00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:23.641
He is?

88
00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:25.151
Sure.

89
00:14:25.351 --> 00:14:27.404
I know what you are thinking.

90
00:14:27.604 --> 00:14:32.066
Well, you are right. That's right.

91
00:14:33.735 --> 00:14:39.157
I wasted a lot of years
God has given me.


92
00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:40.542
But you?

93
00:14:40.742 --> 00:14:42.831
You have your whole
life ahead of you.


94
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:44.921
No more words of wisdom.

95
00:14:45.121 --> 00:14:48.545
Here, buy something to
eat or a new outfit.


96
00:14:48.745 --> 00:14:52.170
I have everything I
need here inside me.


97
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.097
You who know.

98
00:14:54.297 --> 00:14:56.049
Happy Thanksgiving, friend.

99
00:14:56.249 --> 00:14:58.184
Equally.

100
00:14:58.384 --> 00:15:02.731
You know, God never It
never disappoints us.


101
00:15:02.931 --> 00:15:05.183
And never give us more
than that we can handle.


102
00:15:05.383 --> 00:15:07.685
That's it.

103
00:15:08.978 --> 00:15:11.731
And if it's more than
can we stand it?


104
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.150
What is it like?

105
00:15:51.437 --> 00:15:54.273
List what you have to thank.

106
00:15:54.473 --> 00:15:56.901
It would be a very short list.

107
00:16:16.754 --> 00:16:18.548
Wait.

108
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.634
Sorry girl, but not today.

109
00:17:58.743 --> 00:18:03.838
GOD BLESSED ME BEYOND OF
MY DREAMS, DIANA COOPER.


110
00:18:23.342 --> 00:18:29.788
LOCAL DRUG LORD
SENTENCED TO 14 YEARS


111
00:19:01.085 --> 00:19:02.595
Hi.

112
00:19:02.795 --> 00:19:05.256
Excuse.

113
00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:08.617
Oh my God. Excuse me.

114
00:19:08.817 --> 00:19:11.020
I am a mess.

115
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.473
It's Thanksgiving and me I
don't have a cellphone.


116
00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:16.309
I need help, please.

117
00:19:16.509 --> 00:19:17.509
Sorry girl.

118
00:19:17.685 --> 00:19:19.478
Chose the wrong guy
on the wrong day.


119
00:19:19.678 --> 00:19:21.063
It cannot be true.

120
00:19:21.263 --> 00:19:22.877
Nothing happens by chance.

121
00:19:23.077 --> 00:19:24.492
Everything happens for a reason.

122
00:19:24.692 --> 00:19:26.277
Can you talk at once, please?

123
00:19:26.477 --> 00:19:28.029
What you want?

124
00:19:28.229 --> 00:19:29.229
Sure.

125
00:19:29.405 --> 00:19:32.141
Can I use your cellphone?

126
00:19:32.341 --> 00:19:35.077
Sorry, I don't have a cellphone.

127
00:19:35.277 --> 00:19:36.713
Really?

128
00:19:36.913 --> 00:19:39.044
Who doesn't have a
cell phone these days?


129
00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:41.375
Apparently none of us.

130
00:19:41.575 --> 00:19:44.053
Right.

131
00:19:44.253 --> 00:19:45.430
And even if you had a cell phone,

132
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.381
couldn't get one taxi
would pick you up


133
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:49.517
Thanksgiving here.

134
00:19:49.717 --> 00:19:51.093
So there is no chance of

135
00:19:51.293 --> 00:19:55.306
do you go to town so early?

136
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.517
I'm sure if you go
back to the highway,


137
00:19:58.717 --> 00:20:00.144
Someone will show up
and give you a lift,


138
00:20:00.344 --> 00:20:01.696
to the city.

139
00:20:01.896 --> 00:20:05.358
So I think this is a no.

140
00:20:06.651 --> 00:20:10.246
Ok, I'm sorry bother you...

141
00:20:10.446 --> 00:20:15.750
Have a great action thanks,
and God bless you.


142
00:21:07.169 --> 00:21:09.213
I think it's your lucky day.

143
00:21:09.413 --> 00:21:11.307
Really?

144
00:21:11.507 --> 00:21:13.259
Better hurry before
I change my mind.


145
00:21:13.459 --> 00:21:15.282
Oh my God.

146
00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:17.305
Thank you.

147
00:21:18.639 --> 00:21:20.349
Here, I help you with your...

148
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:22.435
All well. Thanks.

149
00:21:24.312 --> 00:21:27.606
Listen, you can sit on the...

150
00:21:27.806 --> 00:21:30.443
Fine.

151
00:21:54.216 --> 00:21:55.801
Good and where are we going?

152
00:21:56.001 --> 00:21:57.228
House, please.

153
00:21:57.428 --> 00:22:00.097
I'll stay with my family today.

154
00:22:00.297 --> 00:22:02.099
And the house is?

155
00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:03.299
How silly.

156
00:22:03.476 --> 00:22:04.902
As if you knew where I live.

157
00:22:05.102 --> 00:22:07.229
Want to know, God will
get you reward for it.


158
00:22:07.429 --> 00:22:09.073
I promise.

159
00:22:09.273 --> 00:22:11.233
Of course He will.

160
00:22:11.433 --> 00:22:13.235
Here it is.

161
00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:23.245
Serve and protect.

162
00:22:23.954 --> 00:22:28.417
Wow, God knew what he was doing.
When it put you in my way.


163
00:22:28.617 --> 00:22:30.836
There is?

164
00:22:31.545 --> 00:22:33.506
Where are you...

165
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.474
Thank you.

166
00:22:35.674 --> 00:22:37.593
So are you a cop?

167
00:22:37.793 --> 00:22:38.895
I was.

168
00:22:39.095 --> 00:22:41.806
You know, you haven't
told me your name yet.


169
00:22:42.006 --> 00:22:44.817
Rick

170
00:22:45.017 --> 00:22:46.560
Nice to meet you, Rick.

171
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.314
I am Grace.

172
00:22:50.514 --> 00:22:52.754
What are you?

173
00:22:52.954 --> 00:22:55.194
I am Grace.

174
00:22:56.362 --> 00:22:58.697
Perfect.

175
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:03.619
Rick, you are pathetic.

176
00:23:03.819 --> 00:23:05.308
What did you say?

177
00:23:05.508 --> 00:23:06.997
Nothing, girl.

178
00:23:13.295 --> 00:23:15.756
So here it says...

179
00:23:16.215 --> 00:23:18.384
This is clearly from
the across the city.


180
00:23:18.584 --> 00:23:19.584
I know.

181
00:23:19.718 --> 00:23:21.766
Where was my head?

182
00:23:21.966 --> 00:23:24.014
Trying to go all the way on foot.

183
00:23:24.214 --> 00:23:26.391
I could never do it.

184
00:23:26.591 --> 00:23:28.769
You saved my life.

185
00:23:33.357 --> 00:23:36.360
It's funny how the
things look different.


186
00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.455
Have you noticed that?

187
00:23:39.655 --> 00:23:43.033
The streets are so empty.

188
00:23:43.742 --> 00:23:47.834
I think everyone is
enjoying the family today.


189
00:23:48.034 --> 00:23:52.126
I almost smell it of
all turkeys roasting.


190
00:24:21.447 --> 00:24:23.657
That was rude from me.

191
00:24:23.857 --> 00:24:25.251
What's it?

192
00:24:25.451 --> 00:24:27.128
Fall asleep like that.

193
00:24:27.328 --> 00:24:30.581
I've been so tired lately.

194
00:24:30.781 --> 00:24:32.800
Do not worry.

195
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.835
I can't wait to be
with my family today.


196
00:24:35.035 --> 00:24:37.463
I'm sure you will see yours too.

197
00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:42.494
Look, I'm extremely grateful for
being with you in this car...


198
00:24:42.694 --> 00:24:45.304
Instead of dragging that
old suitcase out there.


199
00:24:45.504 --> 00:24:47.598
I would never have made it.

200
00:24:49.183 --> 00:24:51.560
Are you a man of faith?

201
00:24:52.228 --> 00:24:55.151
What do you mean, lady?

202
00:24:55.351 --> 00:24:58.275
Do you know, faith, God?

203
00:24:59.485 --> 00:25:01.779
I really don't I think
about it a lot.


204
00:25:01.979 --> 00:25:04.782
It is a pity.

205
00:25:05.366 --> 00:25:07.117
I don't know how anyone
can go through everything


206
00:25:07.317 --> 00:25:08.669
without a little faith.

207
00:25:08.869 --> 00:25:11.914
I have a feeling that we need hope

208
00:25:12.114 --> 00:25:14.687
that there is something
bigger than us,


209
00:25:14.887 --> 00:25:17.461
That there is a purpose
to everything.


210
00:25:18.003 --> 00:25:20.506
We'll have to work on it.

211
00:25:20.706 --> 00:25:21.891
Work on what?

212
00:25:22.091 --> 00:25:25.140
In your faith, or lack
thereof, I think.


213
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.389
And please call me Grace.

214
00:25:28.589 --> 00:25:30.733
As you wish, Grace.

215
00:25:30.933 --> 00:25:32.685
There is a supper waiting
for you at home?


216
00:25:32.885 --> 00:25:34.603
It's hard me focus on the road

217
00:25:34.803 --> 00:25:36.584
with so many questions.

218
00:25:36.784 --> 00:25:38.366
Of course, I'm sorry.

219
00:25:38.566 --> 00:25:40.466
Maybe you find it hard to believe
but I am the last person


220
00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:42.861
what I would call a chatterbox,

221
00:25:43.061 --> 00:25:45.164
Much less nosy.

222
00:25:45.364 --> 00:25:47.575
But I can't be quiet.

223
00:25:48.617 --> 00:25:50.619
Excuse me.

224
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.631
I'll just take you home.

225
00:25:53.831 --> 00:25:58.127
In fact, if you turn right here.

226
00:25:58.327 --> 00:26:00.546
On here?

227
00:26:03.465 --> 00:26:05.009
That. To, stop, stop.

228
00:26:05.209 --> 00:26:07.553
Stop? Grace?

229
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:16.312
Where is she going?

230
00:26:16.512 --> 00:26:18.355
Hey.

231
00:26:18.555 --> 00:26:20.399
Grace?

232
00:26:21.317 --> 00:26:23.260
But what?

233
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.404
Grace?

234
00:26:27.281 --> 00:26:29.058
Grace. Hey.

235
00:26:29.258 --> 00:26:31.035
It can wait?

236
00:26:31.235 --> 00:26:33.037
Grace.

237
00:26:33.996 --> 00:26:35.606
What? Grace.

238
00:26:35.806 --> 00:26:37.157
No, no, no.

239
00:26:37.357 --> 00:26:38.709
Hey, don't go in there.

240
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:40.794
Do not enter.

241
00:26:40.994 --> 00:26:42.921
Hey.

242
00:26:43.121 --> 00:26:44.849
Grace.

243
00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:47.468
What are you going to do?

244
00:26:49.553 --> 00:26:51.805
Grace?

245
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:55.184
Grace? Come here.

246
00:26:56.518 --> 00:26:58.604
What are you doing here?

247
00:26:59.229 --> 00:27:00.651
Hey.

248
00:27:00.851 --> 00:27:02.109
We will.

249
00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:03.367
Come soon.

250
00:27:03.567 --> 00:27:05.611
Grace, please.

251
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:10.074
Grace. Grace.

252
00:27:10.274 --> 00:27:11.500
Hey.

253
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.202
We can not stay here.

254
00:27:13.402 --> 00:27:14.402
What is it?

255
00:27:14.403 --> 00:27:16.084
You never entered
hiding in school?


256
00:27:16.284 --> 00:27:18.040
No, actually I
wanted to sneak out.


257
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.886
I have so many memories.

258
00:27:22.086 --> 00:27:23.879
I used to lie down
in those stands,


259
00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:27.195
The sun shining, loud music.

260
00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:30.511
Did you study at this school?

261
00:27:30.711 --> 00:27:31.929
Is that you?

262
00:27:32.129 --> 00:27:33.147
State.

263
00:27:33.347 --> 00:27:35.099
We massacred you guys in soccer.

264
00:27:35.299 --> 00:27:36.317
Oh yes?

265
00:27:36.517 --> 00:27:38.310
And we slaughtered
you in the pool.


266
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.770
Yeah, it's not the same thing.

267
00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.692
- Oh really?
- Do not.


268
00:27:41.814 --> 00:27:43.699
Ready for a rematch?

269
00:27:43.899 --> 00:27:45.901
No I'm not one Big
fan of the pool.


270
00:27:46.101 --> 00:27:47.152
Ah, so you are afraid.

271
00:27:48.153 --> 00:27:49.538
No, I want to get out of here

272
00:27:49.738 --> 00:27:52.074
before we get caught.

273
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.878
I remember the final
As it was yesterday.


274
00:28:01.078 --> 00:28:04.192
The last year, this
Place was packed.


275
00:28:04.392 --> 00:28:07.506
We had won the Most evidence.

276
00:28:07.706 --> 00:28:09.058
Well, my team had it.

277
00:28:09.258 --> 00:28:12.432
I was not so good, but who cares?

278
00:28:12.632 --> 00:28:15.806
I was happy to support the team.

279
00:28:16.006 --> 00:28:17.566
Grace?

280
00:28:17.766 --> 00:28:21.854
For some reason, I
do not know why,


281
00:28:22.054 --> 00:28:26.942
I looked up and he was there.

282
00:28:27.526 --> 00:28:32.456
Sitting right here
next to my mother.


283
00:28:32.656 --> 00:28:37.244
My father had finally
Come watch me.


284
00:28:37.444 --> 00:28:38.587
You do not understand.

285
00:28:38.787 --> 00:28:42.841
In 4 years, My father
never came to watch me.


286
00:28:43.041 --> 00:28:47.717
He was always travelling,
Always very busy.


287
00:28:47.917 --> 00:28:52.593
And he was there, knocking
clapping and clapping me


288
00:28:52.793 --> 00:28:56.096
as if it were the
Olympics or something.


289
00:28:56.296 --> 00:28:57.639
I did not know what to do.

290
00:28:57.839 --> 00:28:58.983
I was embarrassed.

291
00:28:59.183 --> 00:29:01.050
Sitting there on the bench,
just reaching for the towels,


292
00:29:01.093 --> 00:29:02.570
And he didn't even care.

293
00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:06.231
He was proud of me.

294
00:29:07.608 --> 00:29:10.569
You will not believe
what happened next.


295
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.705
What?

296
00:29:12.905 --> 00:29:14.406
The whole team Calling my name.

297
00:29:14.606 --> 00:29:15.666
"Grace, Grace, Grace."

298
00:29:15.866 --> 00:29:18.836
Me, staring at my father.

299
00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:21.338
Until finally A girl grabbed me.

300
00:29:21.538 --> 00:29:23.874
So, she was pointing to
technician and he frantically


301
00:29:24.074 --> 00:29:25.301
calling me.

302
00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:28.420
And I thought, "What I
did I go wrong now?"


303
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.598
It was the last relay of the day.

304
00:29:30.798 --> 00:29:34.643
One of the girls
hurt or something.


305
00:29:34.843 --> 00:29:38.514
And for some reason, he
I was calling my name.


306
00:29:38.714 --> 00:29:41.016
What did you do?

307
00:29:41.216 --> 00:29:42.818
I swam.

308
00:29:43.018 --> 00:29:48.148
I swam like I never
had Swam in my life.


309
00:29:51.276 --> 00:29:52.969
And we win.

310
00:29:53.169 --> 00:29:54.863
We really won.

311
00:29:55.063 --> 00:29:57.449
It was amazing.

312
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.494
And that test us
qualified for state,


313
00:30:00.694 --> 00:30:04.790
And as they say, it's history.

314
00:30:05.582 --> 00:30:08.836
Well, at least around here,
It was a great achievement.


315
00:30:12.214 --> 00:30:17.636
There was my father,
Just cheering for me.


316
00:30:28.689 --> 00:30:34.870
What I didn't know was that...

317
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:39.116
He was with the
Suitcases in the car.


318
00:30:46.206 --> 00:30:49.418
That was the last day I saw him.

319
00:30:52.337 --> 00:30:54.506
It must have been hard.

320
00:30:57.593 --> 00:30:59.344
You don't imagine how
much do you need dad


321
00:30:59.544 --> 00:31:02.097
until you lose it.

322
00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:06.944
Excuse me.

323
00:31:07.144 --> 00:31:09.855
I don't even know why I am
talking about it with you.


324
00:31:13.775 --> 00:31:15.777
Comes.

325
00:31:17.863 --> 00:31:19.406
- Let's get out of here.
- We will.


326
00:31:19.606 --> 00:31:21.992
Fine.

327
00:31:34.781 --> 00:31:35.781
On here.

328
00:31:36.349 --> 00:31:37.767
Thanks.

329
00:31:37.967 --> 00:31:38.967
Oh, let me get it...

330
00:31:38.993 --> 00:31:40.861
- I take.
- It is not alright.


331
00:31:40.862 --> 00:31:42.719
- No, I make a point.
- Its not good.


332
00:31:42.831 --> 00:31:44.246
I promise that will
be in good hands.


333
00:31:44.298 --> 00:31:46.058
I just...

334
00:31:46.558 --> 00:31:48.668
Okay, you can take it.

335
00:31:48.868 --> 00:31:50.779
Wow, this is heavy.

336
00:31:50.979 --> 00:31:53.231
What do you have here, a toaster?

337
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:56.360
No, no, no.

338
00:31:58.987 --> 00:32:00.364
Maybe I should go.

339
00:32:00.564 --> 00:32:01.665
Excuse me.

340
00:32:01.865 --> 00:32:02.875
I did not have the intention.

341
00:32:03.075 --> 00:32:04.726
Look, I didn't mean to upset you.

342
00:32:04.926 --> 00:32:06.378
No, I know this is that...

343
00:32:06.578 --> 00:32:09.665
There are some things
personal in here, then.


344
00:32:11.375 --> 00:32:14.002
Look, let me take you to home, ok?

345
00:32:17.923 --> 00:32:20.092
On here.

346
00:32:21.426 --> 00:32:23.553
You can keep that
in safety for me?


347
00:32:24.513 --> 00:32:26.515
Sure.

348
00:33:15.897 --> 00:33:17.399
Any more surprises ahead?

349
00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:18.700
Never know.

350
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.070
Let's leave the invasions
aside now, okay?


351
00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.270
What invasion?

352
00:33:23.405 --> 00:33:25.532
I just shook it and it opened.

353
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.286
All right, all right, cop.

354
00:33:30.954 --> 00:33:32.256
Ah.

355
00:33:32.456 --> 00:33:34.458
So you know how to smile.

356
00:33:34.658 --> 00:33:36.176
I knew it.

357
00:33:36.376 --> 00:33:39.004
Yeah, I can smile.

358
00:33:39.713 --> 00:33:40.931
Wow.

359
00:33:41.131 --> 00:33:42.641
Two in a row.

360
00:33:42.841 --> 00:33:45.343
You should smile more often.

361
00:33:45.543 --> 00:33:47.763
Looks good smiling.

362
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.974
You know, people don't even would
notice how you dress badly


363
00:33:51.174 --> 00:33:52.851
if you smiled more often.

364
00:33:53.051 --> 00:33:54.486
Hey.

365
00:33:54.686 --> 00:33:56.438
You know what they talk
about smiling, right?


366
00:33:56.638 --> 00:33:57.638
No, I do not know.

367
00:33:57.689 --> 00:33:59.149
The smile is like a
tight underwear.


368
00:33:59.349 --> 00:34:01.026
They make your cheeks rise.

369
00:34:04.196 --> 00:34:06.531
That was terrible.

370
00:34:08.158 --> 00:34:10.160
Seriously, it was very bad.

371
00:34:14.706 --> 00:34:16.668
Oh my God. Caution.

372
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.387
Are you alright?

373
00:34:20.587 --> 00:34:22.672
You almost killed a man.

374
00:34:23.256 --> 00:34:25.258
I know this man.

375
00:34:25.801 --> 00:34:27.769
Hey.

376
00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.930
Are you ok, man?

377
00:34:31.348 --> 00:34:32.733
Are you alright?

378
00:34:32.933 --> 00:34:35.602
I have a legion of Angels
taking care of me.


379
00:34:35.802 --> 00:34:36.802
I'm great.

380
00:34:36.803 --> 00:34:38.647
What are you doing in
the middle of the road?


381
00:34:38.847 --> 00:34:39.948
I could...

382
00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:41.533
I could have run you over.

383
00:34:41.733 --> 00:34:46.571
We are exactly where we should
be every moment moment.


384
00:34:46.771 --> 00:34:48.698
I can't say the even
from your cart.


385
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.216
Isn't that a great feeling?

386
00:34:58.416 --> 00:35:00.360
This what, what are
you talking about?


387
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.558
What was the last time you gave

388
00:35:02.758 --> 00:35:04.756
A good laugh like that, Rick?

389
00:35:04.956 --> 00:35:06.716
I can not remember.

390
00:35:06.916 --> 00:35:08.677
How do you know my name?

391
00:35:08.877 --> 00:35:10.312
I know who you are.

392
00:35:10.512 --> 00:35:13.223
His wife, Jenna,
was a light of joy


393
00:35:13.423 --> 00:35:15.976
for all of us in the shelter.

394
00:35:16.176 --> 00:35:18.153
Ah yes.

395
00:35:18.353 --> 00:35:20.714
She loved working there.

396
00:35:20.914 --> 00:35:23.275
We all miss her.

397
00:35:24.651 --> 00:35:26.370
Yes.

398
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:28.780
I am Jeremiah.

399
00:35:29.447 --> 00:35:31.307
Pleasure.

400
00:35:31.507 --> 00:35:33.168
Rick

401
00:35:33.368 --> 00:35:35.745
But that you already know.

402
00:35:36.329 --> 00:35:39.082
Are you all well?

403
00:35:40.584 --> 00:35:43.295
And who is this beautiful girl?

404
00:35:43.495 --> 00:35:47.215
Hi, I'm Grace.

405
00:35:47.415 --> 00:35:48.684
Grace?

406
00:35:48.884 --> 00:35:50.202
What a perfect name.

407
00:35:50.402 --> 00:35:51.520
I am Jeremiah.

408
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.098
Jeremiah, God's chosen one.

409
00:35:55.298 --> 00:35:56.745
That's right.

410
00:35:56.945 --> 00:35:58.193
Smart girl.

411
00:35:58.393 --> 00:36:00.687
You know, I think the Lord
I knew what I was doing


412
00:36:00.887 --> 00:36:03.106
when you put this cart over there.

413
00:36:03.306 --> 00:36:05.942
I have something for you.

414
00:36:06.943 --> 00:36:09.079
I was going to give it
to you this morning,


415
00:36:09.279 --> 00:36:15.634
but you were so
Hurry I let it go.

416
00:36:15.834 --> 00:36:19.080
So this here belongs
to your son, Luke.


417
00:36:22.209 --> 00:36:23.885
Where did you get it?

418
00:36:24.085 --> 00:36:26.430
His wife was carrying
Luke in the shelter


419
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:30.759
a few times, and I played
Ball with him in the yard.


420
00:36:30.959 --> 00:36:34.813
And left it there, and how
we didn't see them any more.


421
00:36:35.013 --> 00:36:38.725
Anyway, I thought that
you should keep that.


422
00:36:41.394 --> 00:36:43.488
Thank you.

423
00:36:43.688 --> 00:36:47.117
Now you can give it back to him,

424
00:36:47.317 --> 00:36:52.572
Although I imagine you have
bought a new one long time ago.


425
00:37:07.254 --> 00:37:09.681
Are you alright?

426
00:37:09.881 --> 00:37:14.636
I never liked to see her
working in that shelter,


427
00:37:14.836 --> 00:37:17.138
Those ragged.

428
00:37:18.056 --> 00:37:21.101
I think I was wrong.

429
00:37:21.893 --> 00:37:25.105
She always saw the well on people.

430
00:37:25.305 --> 00:37:27.607
I only saw the evil.

431
00:37:28.233 --> 00:37:30.744
What happened to her?

432
00:37:30.944 --> 00:37:33.405
Here I am being nosy again.

433
00:37:33.989 --> 00:37:36.641
I was a cop.

434
00:37:36.841 --> 00:37:39.294
Protect and serve.

435
00:37:39.494 --> 00:37:41.997
It was my job to protect her.

436
00:37:43.123 --> 00:37:45.125
Rick, stop the car.

437
00:37:59.472 --> 00:38:02.559
We were working in this
case a long time ago.


438
00:38:04.769 --> 00:38:06.771
We finally arrested the guy.

439
00:38:08.231 --> 00:38:16.231
An exemplary citizen,
volunteer philanthropist


440
00:38:16.814 --> 00:38:19.543
with the kids in the best school.

441
00:38:19.743 --> 00:38:24.372
And also responsible for half
of state drug trafficking.


442
00:38:24.572 --> 00:38:30.462
I won a promotion, and he
fourteen years in prison.


443
00:38:32.005 --> 00:38:37.552
But instead of rot in a cell,

444
00:38:37.752 --> 00:38:40.388
He had cancer.

445
00:38:41.431 --> 00:38:44.860
And it was very bad.

446
00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.113
He was transferred to a hospital.

447
00:38:48.313 --> 00:38:54.812
I knew it wouldn't take long
until it escaped from there.


448
00:38:56.112 --> 00:39:00.241
And when I escaped I was the
first person he would look for.


449
00:39:04.371 --> 00:39:06.673
I saved money,

450
00:39:06.873 --> 00:39:09.709
I did everything hidden from Jenna
because it would be a surprise.


451
00:39:09.909 --> 00:39:11.678
While I was in an agency,

452
00:39:11.878 --> 00:39:15.382
marking the trip to Paris
that was her dream,


453
00:39:15.582 --> 00:39:17.842
that bastard was Coming after me.

454
00:39:18.426 --> 00:39:20.553
Love?

455
00:39:21.262 --> 00:39:23.748
I have a surprise for you.

456
00:39:23.948 --> 00:39:26.234
I think you'll like it.

457
00:39:26.434 --> 00:39:28.904
I saw Luke playing
soccer in the street,


458
00:39:29.104 --> 00:39:32.816
So I think we are alone now.

459
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.452
It's just us both, love.

460
00:39:35.652 --> 00:39:39.406
This food is with a great smell.

461
00:39:43.618 --> 00:39:45.128
Hey.

462
00:39:45.328 --> 00:39:47.063
Why, isn't it lovely?

463
00:39:47.263 --> 00:39:48.998
Go ahead, pull.

464
00:39:51.543 --> 00:39:53.611
Baby, go outside now.

465
00:39:53.811 --> 00:39:55.880
You stay right there, love.

466
00:39:58.091 --> 00:40:00.385
Sit down soon.

467
00:40:02.011 --> 00:40:03.763
She has nothing to do
with that, Jenkins.


468
00:40:03.963 --> 00:40:05.774
She has everything to do with it.

469
00:40:05.974 --> 00:40:12.188
My wife, my son, my life,
you took it all from me.


470
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.653
What you want?

471
00:40:14.853 --> 00:40:16.576
What I want?

472
00:40:16.776 --> 00:40:18.653
How about a cancer cure?

473
00:40:23.616 --> 00:40:25.502
I'm dying, detective.

474
00:40:25.702 --> 00:40:27.916
I will die alone and cold,

475
00:40:28.116 --> 00:40:30.331
And I want you to
feel what it's like.


476
00:40:31.749 --> 00:40:33.134
What are you, a ninja?

477
00:40:33.334 --> 00:40:36.463
Keep getting closer, I
will not talk again.


478
00:40:36.663 --> 00:40:38.306
Turn around and walk away.

479
00:40:38.506 --> 00:40:40.091
No one needs to get hurt.

480
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:41.518
Really?

481
00:40:41.718 --> 00:40:43.636
No one needs to get hurt?

482
00:40:46.055 --> 00:40:48.099
How about if I hurt this one?

483
00:40:54.272 --> 00:40:56.065
It was three shots.

484
00:41:03.323 --> 00:41:06.392
One crossed my knee,

485
00:41:06.592 --> 00:41:09.662
And the other one killed that guy.

486
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:15.418
And then I fell to the floor.

487
00:41:17.218 --> 00:41:18.657
And I saw my wife

488
00:41:21.185 --> 00:41:22.377
lying there.

489
00:41:23.926 --> 00:41:25.460
She was suffering.

490
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:31.151
Hey. Hey.

491
00:41:31.351 --> 00:41:33.353
What happened, love?
What happened?


492
00:41:33.553 --> 00:41:34.696
What happened?

493
00:41:34.896 --> 00:41:37.315
- I can not breathe.
- It'll be all right, love.


494
00:41:37.515 --> 00:41:41.870
- Calm down.
- Promise to me.


495
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.348
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want.


496
00:41:45.548 --> 00:41:48.826
Know that Luke Know how
much you love him.


497
00:41:50.703 --> 00:41:52.705
I promise.

498
00:41:56.709 --> 00:42:01.514
I love you.

499
00:42:01.714 --> 00:42:02.714
I love you. We will.

500
00:42:02.799 --> 00:42:05.301
Hey, stay with me, please?

501
00:42:05.501 --> 00:42:08.604
Stay with me. Love?

502
00:42:11.182 --> 00:42:14.185
I failed.

503
00:42:15.186 --> 00:42:20.858
As a cop, as a husband...

504
00:42:22.777 --> 00:42:25.613
and as a father.

505
00:42:28.283 --> 00:42:31.244
Today makes five
years that happened.


506
00:42:33.454 --> 00:42:36.958
I'm so sorry.

507
00:42:37.625 --> 00:42:44.632
I relived that day
again many times.


508
00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:51.556
It's never too late to
deliver on your promise.


509
00:42:55.685 --> 00:42:59.397
I'll take you home.

510
00:43:40.271 --> 00:43:42.357
Rick, please stop the car.

511
00:43:42.557 --> 00:43:44.567
What's it?

512
00:43:57.413 --> 00:44:00.750
Grace, what is it?

513
00:44:03.378 --> 00:44:04.762
Clock is ticking.

514
00:44:04.962 --> 00:44:07.698
Do you think it's true God chooses

515
00:44:07.898 --> 00:44:10.435
a special person for each of us?

516
00:44:10.635 --> 00:44:12.261
That person who is
destined to be with us


517
00:44:12.461 --> 00:44:13.897
for the rest of our lives.

518
00:44:14.097 --> 00:44:15.723
And it will start over
with talk about God.


519
00:44:15.923 --> 00:44:17.975
We can just...

520
00:44:18.175 --> 00:44:20.353
Grace?

521
00:44:24.774 --> 00:44:26.275
What are you doing, Grace?

522
00:44:26.475 --> 00:44:27.952
What.

523
00:44:28.152 --> 00:44:29.329
Come on, Rick.

524
00:44:29.529 --> 00:44:31.114
I can see a
thread of hope in you.

525
00:44:31.314 --> 00:44:33.574
It doesn't have to be
Tough all the time.


526
00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:38.371
Grace?

527
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.668
She did it again.

528
00:44:54.011 --> 00:44:56.764
Believe in love at first sight?

529
00:44:57.223 --> 00:44:59.041
I worked in a cafe

530
00:44:59.241 --> 00:45:00.860
not far from here.

531
00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.647
And then this tall and
Beautiful sailor comes in.


532
00:45:04.847 --> 00:45:07.075
He sits at the counter.

533
00:45:07.275 --> 00:45:10.194
I'm so nervous that I can
barely serve a coffee.


534
00:45:10.394 --> 00:45:12.664
What are we doing here?

535
00:45:12.864 --> 00:45:15.124
It was love at first
dress with him.


536
00:45:15.324 --> 00:45:17.059
Married me on the first date.

537
00:45:17.259 --> 00:45:18.826
I mean, I didn't have a
wedding ring or nothing,


538
00:45:18.995 --> 00:45:25.501
But he knew I was special,
and I knew he was too.


539
00:45:25.701 --> 00:45:28.921
And they came here, learnt
to dance for your wedding?


540
00:45:29.121 --> 00:45:32.049
Wow, that was cruel.

541
00:45:32.508 --> 00:45:35.052
Did he really need to say?

542
00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:39.925
Do you think it's
the only one that


543
00:45:39.928 --> 00:45:41.978
have you had special
moments, Grace?


544
00:45:42.176 --> 00:45:44.937
My wife and I already came here.

545
00:45:45.137 --> 00:45:47.940
And this is where she
gave me taught to dance.


546
00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.485
And yes, it went to the
dance our marriage,


547
00:45:51.685 --> 00:45:54.947
And we promise never
we would stop dancing.


548
00:45:55.147 --> 00:45:58.409
And then your God, in
your infinite wisdom,


549
00:45:58.609 --> 00:46:02.088
took it from me.

550
00:46:02.288 --> 00:46:05.333
And we never we could
dance together.


551
00:46:07.168 --> 00:46:09.754
How about this happy ending?

552
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:13.157
I'm so sorry.

553
00:46:13.357 --> 00:46:15.184
I feel for what?

554
00:46:15.384 --> 00:46:17.228
You don't have to be sorry.

555
00:46:17.428 --> 00:46:20.389
You will spend the Day of Thanks
with your family, and I don't.


556
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:22.767
Can we go back to the car now?

557
00:46:23.935 --> 00:46:26.646
It was love at first
dress you too?


558
00:46:26.846 --> 00:46:28.543
Does it matter?

559
00:46:28.743 --> 00:46:30.441
Perhaps. Was?

560
00:46:32.235 --> 00:46:33.611
Rick, was it?

561
00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:36.197
Yes.

562
00:46:37.824 --> 00:46:41.744
My heart almost jumped to it
was the moment I saw her.


563
00:46:41.944 --> 00:46:43.087
So maybe it's true that God

564
00:46:43.287 --> 00:46:46.503
choose a special
person for each of us.


565
00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:49.719
And no matter how much
time spent with them.


566
00:46:49.919 --> 00:46:54.173
What matters is how we
enjoyed the time with them.


567
00:46:54.674 --> 00:46:59.579
Maybe that's why God
put us together today,


568
00:46:59.779 --> 00:47:04.684
To teach us how to appreciate
every moment we have.


569
00:47:14.986 --> 00:47:17.613
What?

570
00:47:18.322 --> 00:47:20.408
No, I'm not one any
more Good dancer.


571
00:47:20.608 --> 00:47:23.348
I have a leg problem, remember?

572
00:47:23.548 --> 00:47:26.289
Come on. No one is looking.

573
00:47:30.793 --> 00:47:32.136
Dance with me, cop.

574
00:47:32.336 --> 00:47:34.797
I can't. I have to review
this case for tomorrow.


575
00:47:36.173 --> 00:47:38.092
The case will still be there
tomorrow, Not this moment.


576
00:47:38.292 --> 00:47:40.135
It is a great case.
What are you doing?


577
00:47:40.335 --> 00:47:42.179
What are you doing?
I have to work.


578
00:47:42.379 --> 00:47:43.648
I have to work.

579
00:47:43.848 --> 00:47:45.349
I can not dance now.

580
00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:48.060
Yes you can.

581
00:50:54.163 --> 00:50:57.041
Your God is not making
it easy for us.


582
00:51:00.628 --> 00:51:02.096
It broke.

583
00:51:02.296 --> 00:51:04.239
This old can broke.

584
00:51:04.439 --> 00:51:06.383
Then we can go walking.

585
00:51:06.583 --> 00:51:07.583
Walking?

586
00:51:07.635 --> 00:51:08.635
No. Do you want to know?

587
00:51:08.636 --> 00:51:09.636
I will ask for help...

588
00:51:09.678 --> 00:51:11.063
No, let's get going.
It will be fun.


589
00:51:11.263 --> 00:51:12.973
It is a beautiful day.
I'll get my things.


590
00:51:13.173 --> 00:51:14.173
Do you want to walk?

591
00:51:14.174 --> 00:51:15.976
I want.

592
00:51:21.357 --> 00:51:22.658
Listening...

593
00:51:22.858 --> 00:51:25.027
Thanks. Come on.

594
00:51:26.153 --> 00:51:30.116
Fine. Let's walk.

595
00:51:51.345 --> 00:51:53.685
Look, I think if the we turn left

596
00:51:53.885 --> 00:51:56.456
and make the curve,
we get to your house.


597
00:51:56.656 --> 00:51:59.228
There is no other
way what can we do?


598
00:51:59.428 --> 00:52:00.729
Look, this is the shortest way.

599
00:52:00.929 --> 00:52:02.231
I think it gives a dead end,

600
00:52:02.431 --> 00:52:04.567
so let's go the other way.

601
00:52:04.767 --> 00:52:06.744
Grace, what happened?

602
00:52:06.944 --> 00:52:09.321
Is that my in-laws
live right there.


603
00:52:09.521 --> 00:52:10.521
Great.

604
00:52:10.656 --> 00:52:13.117
Maybe they can help with my car.

605
00:52:13.317 --> 00:52:15.327
In fact they have changed
It's been a while.


606
00:52:15.527 --> 00:52:17.580
Can we go the other street?

607
00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.373
Please.

608
00:52:19.573 --> 00:52:20.967
I understand.

609
00:52:21.167 --> 00:52:23.252
You have some problems
with your in-laws.


610
00:52:23.452 --> 00:52:25.045
Welcome to the club.

611
00:52:25.245 --> 00:52:26.639
I did not say that.

612
00:52:26.839 --> 00:52:29.258
They were wonderful.

613
00:52:59.538 --> 00:53:02.583
Can you show me How
do the lights work?


614
00:53:05.294 --> 00:53:06.887
That Cool.

615
00:53:07.087 --> 00:53:09.673
Hey do you wanna
play hide and seek?


616
00:53:10.216 --> 00:53:12.176
All right, go hide.

617
00:53:14.803 --> 00:53:16.726
Do not go too far.

618
00:53:16.926 --> 00:53:18.649
He'll be fine.

619
00:53:18.849 --> 00:53:20.901
Tommy was everything to them.

620
00:53:21.101 --> 00:53:23.357
He was the only
connection with their son


621
00:53:23.557 --> 00:53:25.814
While he was serving
in Afghanistan.


622
00:53:26.014 --> 00:53:29.192
So your husband served in the war?

623
00:53:29.392 --> 00:53:32.371
I was talking to him
direct by Skype.


624
00:53:32.571 --> 00:53:39.536
Tommy was so proud of the father,
and father loved him very much.


625
00:53:41.288 --> 00:53:43.958
Here I go.

626
00:53:47.211 --> 00:53:49.129
So how was the trip?

627
00:53:49.329 --> 00:53:50.526
We wanted so badly to go.

628
00:53:50.726 --> 00:53:51.726
It was wonderful.

629
00:53:51.924 --> 00:53:53.509
You both need go next time.

630
00:53:53.709 --> 00:53:55.019
I know.

631
00:53:55.219 --> 00:53:57.054
I can't find Tommy.

632
00:53:57.254 --> 00:53:58.805
What?

633
00:53:59.005 --> 00:54:00.357
Tommy?

634
00:54:00.557 --> 00:54:02.643
Well, he must not have gone far.

635
00:54:03.477 --> 00:54:05.688
Tommy?

636
00:54:10.192 --> 00:54:12.778
Tommy? Tommy.

637
00:54:20.369 --> 00:54:22.079
I could not breathe.

638
00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:23.714
Tommy.

639
00:54:23.914 --> 00:54:26.583
I couldn't move.

640
00:54:29.837 --> 00:54:32.074
You're not the only one who feels

641
00:54:32.077 --> 00:54:34.719
that failed with
the people you love.


642
00:54:35.134 --> 00:54:38.308
I fought it for so many years

643
00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:41.682
and blaming me for
it every single day.


644
00:54:41.882 --> 00:54:44.435
Grace, it wasn't your fault.

645
00:54:46.103 --> 00:54:49.298
Faith is believing things.
That we can't see.


646
00:54:49.498 --> 00:54:52.693
I trust all this is
part of a larger plan


647
00:54:52.893 --> 00:54:55.412
and that has a meaning.

648
00:54:55.612 --> 00:54:58.532
I gave up on
understanding long time.


649
00:54:58.732 --> 00:54:59.908
You can not give up.

650
00:55:00.108 --> 00:55:01.585
You can not.

651
00:55:01.785 --> 00:55:05.664
You have to trust that God
knows more than we do.


652
00:55:05.864 --> 00:55:07.750
I got killed by inside for years.

653
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:09.385
There is no hope for me.

654
00:55:09.585 --> 00:55:14.590
I've been in the same
Black hole that you are.


655
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.758
There is hope.

656
00:55:16.958 --> 00:55:18.927
Believe me.

657
00:55:21.805 --> 00:55:23.274
Let's get going.

658
00:55:23.474 --> 00:55:25.434
We have to go. After a
while it begins to cool.


659
00:55:26.769 --> 00:55:28.228
Thank you, Rick.

660
00:55:28.428 --> 00:55:29.428
Whereby?

661
00:55:29.605 --> 00:55:33.525
For giving me a lift, walk
with me, listen to me.


662
00:55:35.527 --> 00:55:37.488
It's Thanksgiving, isn't it?

663
00:55:37.688 --> 00:55:39.740
You're right.

664
00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:41.992
We will.

665
00:55:48.916 --> 00:55:50.009
Luke?

666
00:55:50.209 --> 00:55:51.919
Honey, it's time to eat.

667
00:55:52.119 --> 00:55:54.338
I'm going.

668
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:05.065
Hope you are hungry.

669
00:56:05.265 --> 00:56:07.101
I smelt this turkey
Baking all day, Grandma.


670
00:56:07.301 --> 00:56:08.519
I'm hungry.

671
00:56:08.719 --> 00:56:09.719
How nice.

672
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.230
Because we have Lots of food here.

673
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:12.781
Hey Hey hey.

674
00:56:12.981 --> 00:56:15.317
Not forgetting You're
welcome, good guy?


675
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:21.907
Dear God, thank you
for this special day


676
00:56:22.107 --> 00:56:23.542
And for all our blessings.

677
00:56:23.742 --> 00:56:26.787
And Lord, we just ask that
you take care of those


678
00:56:26.987 --> 00:56:31.125
That can't be here with us today.

679
00:56:31.325 --> 00:56:33.919
Blessed be your name, amen.

680
00:56:37.381 --> 00:56:39.533
Luke?

681
00:56:39.733 --> 00:56:41.885
Amen.

682
00:56:42.386 --> 00:56:45.681
So, any news about
your father today?


683
00:56:45.881 --> 00:56:48.851
I left a message for him.

684
00:56:49.051 --> 00:56:50.152
Yes, grandma.

685
00:56:50.352 --> 00:56:52.104
He should reach anytime.

686
00:56:52.304 --> 00:56:53.584
Never know.

687
00:56:53.784 --> 00:56:54.865
It may happen.

688
00:56:55.065 --> 00:56:57.526
Grandma, every festivity you
prepare an extra place,


689
00:56:57.726 --> 00:57:01.446
and every year this
Place remains empty.


690
00:57:01.646 --> 00:57:05.167
Well, I don't think
so we can give up.


691
00:57:05.367 --> 00:57:10.122
We can just eat and and
talk about it later?


692
00:57:10.322 --> 00:57:12.583
Sure.

693
00:57:20.966 --> 00:57:24.428
Grandma, do you mind
if I eat in my room?


694
00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:30.792
You know, he just needs
more a while, Luke.


695
00:57:30.992 --> 00:57:35.105
And it's taking longer
than we would like,


696
00:57:35.305 --> 00:57:36.815
But he will appear.

697
00:57:37.015 --> 00:57:38.575
You will see.

698
00:57:38.775 --> 00:57:42.154
And is that still really matter?

699
00:57:42.354 --> 00:57:45.199
Honey, of course it matters.

700
00:57:45.399 --> 00:57:48.202
Your father loves you.

701
00:57:50.412 --> 00:57:53.332
What a funny way
to demonstrate it.


702
00:57:53.532 --> 00:57:55.563
I can?

703
00:57:55.763 --> 00:57:57.794
Sure.

704
00:57:58.962 --> 00:58:01.010
Is there enough there?

705
00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:03.258
Yes there is. Thank you, grandma.

706
00:58:03.458 --> 00:58:05.844
You're welcome.

707
00:58:06.762 --> 00:58:10.224
Honey, remember to save
one space for pie I made.


708
00:58:10.424 --> 00:58:11.442
Fine.

709
00:58:11.642 --> 00:58:14.269
I made the one you like.

710
00:58:21.026 --> 00:58:24.988
I think I'm smelling of turkey
coming out of the oven.


711
00:58:25.188 --> 00:58:26.656
Do you like turkey?

712
00:58:26.856 --> 00:58:28.125
Yeah, I think so.

713
00:58:28.325 --> 00:58:30.419
I mean, actually...

714
00:58:30.619 --> 00:58:34.748
I don't eat a supper with
turkey a long time ago.


715
00:58:35.457 --> 00:58:36.717
Thinking well,

716
00:58:36.917 --> 00:58:38.752
I can't remember Last
time I ate turkey.


717
00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.520
Well, I'm sure that you
and your family will have


718
00:58:41.621 --> 00:58:44.383
a great day of action
Thanks together.


719
00:58:48.136 --> 00:58:49.146
Are you alright?

720
00:58:49.346 --> 00:58:51.014
Yes I'm fine. Is that you?

721
00:58:51.214 --> 00:58:52.358
Me too.

722
00:58:52.558 --> 00:58:54.226
I'm sorry if ruined your day

723
00:58:54.426 --> 00:58:57.112
With my crazy journey.

724
00:58:57.312 --> 00:59:00.941
Believe me, there was no
Nothing better to do.


725
00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.663
Wants to know?

726
00:59:06.863 --> 00:59:10.367
Why don't we go warm
there a little?


727
00:59:22.004 --> 00:59:24.506
This church is very
beautiful, isn't it?


728
00:59:24.706 --> 00:59:26.308
Yeah, if you say so.

729
00:59:26.508 --> 00:59:27.993
What are you doing?

730
00:59:28.193 --> 00:59:29.478
I'll just see if it's open.

731
00:59:29.678 --> 00:59:30.887
It's thanksgiving.
It will be closed.


732
00:59:31.087 --> 00:59:32.785
I will rock and see.

733
00:59:32.985 --> 00:59:34.683
It worked for you.

734
00:59:55.412 --> 00:59:58.290
It is so beautiful.

735
01:00:16.808 --> 01:00:19.728
It's not much hotter in
here, isn't it true?


736
01:00:19.928 --> 01:00:22.614
Yes, you are right.

737
01:00:22.814 --> 01:00:25.651
It's been so long since I I
don't sit on a bench like that.


738
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:28.070
I miss.

739
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:29.621
You?

740
01:00:29.821 --> 01:00:33.367
To tell you the
truth, I thought you


741
01:00:33.370 --> 01:00:36.914
I always went to
that kind of place.


742
01:00:37.112 --> 01:00:39.006
I go to my heart.

743
01:00:39.206 --> 01:00:43.001
But it's been a long time
since I I can't go to church.


744
01:00:44.753 --> 01:00:46.755
Because of the bid
not having a car?


745
01:00:46.955 --> 01:00:48.682
No, you fool.

746
01:00:48.882 --> 01:00:53.178
But you're right, a car It would
have been very useful today.


747
01:00:55.681 --> 01:00:59.393
And your wife, did
she go to church?


748
01:01:01.603 --> 01:01:03.230
I'm sorry you don't
have to talk about it.


749
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:04.773
No, no, it's fine.

750
01:01:04.973 --> 01:01:06.366
Yes.

751
01:01:06.566 --> 01:01:09.823
Yes, she always went to church
and I would go with her,


752
01:01:10.023 --> 01:01:13.281
because she liked for
me to accompany her.


753
01:01:13.481 --> 01:01:16.660
And my son looked like like to go,

754
01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.922
and that made her happy.

755
01:01:20.122 --> 01:01:22.633
You are a good man, Rick.

756
01:01:22.833 --> 01:01:25.919
Any other guy would be
sitting watching a game


757
01:01:26.119 --> 01:01:27.638
or anything else.

758
01:01:27.838 --> 01:01:29.765
No, that made her
happy. And that's why.


759
01:01:29.965 --> 01:01:34.094
That I never stepped on
a church in five years.


760
01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:37.723
I understand.

761
01:01:39.725 --> 01:01:45.247
Sometimes it's hard to trust

762
01:01:45.447 --> 01:01:49.387
God always knows what He does.

763
01:01:51.987 --> 01:01:54.598
Listen, maybe it's better
to people go walking,


764
01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:57.484
because it will cool
as night falls.


765
01:01:57.684 --> 01:02:00.370
Do you mind if
I pray before I go?

766
01:02:03.874 --> 01:02:06.376
All well.

767
01:02:07.961 --> 01:02:10.222
You can join me if you want.

768
01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:15.677
No, no, you don't have
to. I'm right here.


769
01:02:24.936 --> 01:02:30.859
Lord, I was in a Bad
time this morning.


770
01:02:31.059 --> 01:02:34.383
Forgive me for not trust in you.

771
01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:37.708
You sent me to the
middle of nowhere,


772
01:02:37.908 --> 01:02:42.729
And I met this kind
man who is Rick.


773
01:02:42.929 --> 01:02:47.179
You made us find for a reason.

774
01:02:47.379 --> 01:02:51.630
And I pray that you
soften his heart.


775
01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:53.974
He went through so much.

776
01:02:54.174 --> 01:02:58.808
And I pray that you Give him
understanding and peace.


777
01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:03.642
So we can continue our
journey today, amen.


778
01:03:26.832 --> 01:03:29.835
I hope you do not mind to have
included you in the prayer.


779
01:03:30.418 --> 01:03:31.637
Do not.

780
01:03:31.837 --> 01:03:33.555
It's all right.

781
01:03:33.755 --> 01:03:35.966
It's all right. We will.

782
01:03:39.427 --> 01:03:40.974
Wait.

783
01:03:41.174 --> 01:03:42.522
What's it?

784
01:03:42.722 --> 01:03:44.057
I forgot my bag in there.

785
01:03:44.257 --> 01:03:46.476
I seek for you.

786
01:04:35.775 --> 01:04:42.282
God, if it's around...

787
01:04:49.414 --> 01:04:51.416
please help me.

788
01:05:06.306 --> 01:05:07.306
Thanks.

789
01:05:08.199 --> 01:05:09.893
You're welcome.

790
01:05:12.062 --> 01:05:13.897
Can we go this way?

791
01:05:14.097 --> 01:05:15.941
Fine.

792
01:05:22.447 --> 01:05:23.447
Hey.

793
01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:24.741
Where are we going?

794
01:05:24.941 --> 01:05:25.941
It's a shortcut.

795
01:05:26.025 --> 01:05:27.025
Shortcut?

796
01:05:27.026 --> 01:05:28.211
Are you sure?

797
01:05:28.411 --> 01:05:31.331
Why? As if I had a choice.

798
01:05:34.542 --> 01:05:36.044
Grace.

799
01:05:36.711 --> 01:05:37.721
Grace.

800
01:05:37.921 --> 01:05:38.972
Where are we going?

801
01:05:39.172 --> 01:05:41.758
I want to buy time, to
take you to your son.


802
01:05:41.958 --> 01:05:42.958
I was thinking about it.

803
01:05:42.968 --> 01:05:44.803
And you know,
actually my son he...


804
01:05:45.003 --> 01:05:46.096
This is not a good idea.

805
01:05:46.296 --> 01:05:47.296
I'm listening.

806
01:05:47.472 --> 01:05:49.999
You say you are listening,
But you are not.


807
01:05:50.199 --> 01:05:52.727
You are just walking,
You keep walking.


808
01:05:52.927 --> 01:05:54.166
Grace.

809
01:05:54.366 --> 01:05:55.405
Hey. Grace.

810
01:05:55.605 --> 01:05:57.440
You can slow down, please?

811
01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.640
Excuse me.

812
01:05:58.817 --> 01:06:00.151
I do not know what happened to me.

813
01:06:00.351 --> 01:06:02.621
I think this is the place.

814
01:06:02.821 --> 01:06:06.241
Hey, this is my old
one baseball field.


815
01:06:06.441 --> 01:06:07.742
I played here when I was young.

816
01:06:07.942 --> 01:06:09.014
Did you play?

817
01:06:09.214 --> 01:06:10.214
Yes.

818
01:06:10.286 --> 01:06:11.379
Wow, it's changed a lot.

819
01:06:11.579 --> 01:06:15.250
But in the old days
team bench on each side


820
01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:17.335
And the stands they
were in that corner.


821
01:06:17.535 --> 01:06:20.088
My parents never lost a game.

822
01:06:20.288 --> 01:06:22.215
Really?

823
01:06:22.966 --> 01:06:25.969
It's been a long time
since I do not come here.


824
01:06:43.903 --> 01:06:48.324
I used to bring my son here
before he was old enough to play.


825
01:06:50.452 --> 01:06:52.912
He couldn't wait for the time.

826
01:06:54.122 --> 01:06:56.879
I'm sure you stood in the stands

827
01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:59.836
seeing every minute of the
game your son, isn't it?


828
01:07:01.171 --> 01:07:03.431
No, I didn't stay.

829
01:07:03.631 --> 01:07:05.759
I was always very busy.

830
01:07:05.959 --> 01:07:08.595
Excuse me.

831
01:07:09.763 --> 01:07:12.390
He always asked to play with him.

832
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:18.063
He put that small glove and said:

833
01:07:18.263 --> 01:07:21.566
"Dad, do you play with me?"

834
01:07:21.766 --> 01:07:24.244
"
- Not today, little guy.

835
01:07:24.444 --> 01:07:27.572
Daddy has to arrest
some bad guys."


836
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:31.293
At least you still has it around.

837
01:07:31.493 --> 01:07:36.998
You know, when his mother,
when Jenna was killed,


838
01:07:37.198 --> 01:07:40.418
we went through moments
very difficult.


839
01:07:40.618 --> 01:07:42.420
I was bad.

840
01:07:46.925 --> 01:07:49.385
He gets mine mother since then.

841
01:07:49.585 --> 01:07:50.970
But it's been five years.

842
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:52.170
Do you still see him?

843
01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:53.359
Of course I see him.

844
01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.979
I see him every day.

845
01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:56.810
Only he doesn't know.

846
01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:59.154
He does not know?

847
01:07:59.354 --> 01:08:03.108
When I drive, I see him play ball

848
01:08:03.308 --> 01:08:06.444
or playing with friends.

849
01:08:07.278 --> 01:08:10.098
Rick, you can't do this.

850
01:08:10.298 --> 01:08:12.918
A son needs a father.

851
01:08:13.118 --> 01:08:15.411
It's not fair you
stay away from him.


852
01:08:15.611 --> 01:08:17.017
He is doing well.

853
01:08:17.217 --> 01:08:18.612
He's a good boy.

854
01:08:18.812 --> 01:08:20.432
He is better off without me.

855
01:08:20.632 --> 01:08:22.052
You do not believe it.

856
01:08:22.252 --> 01:08:25.255
I am sure that He misses you.

857
01:08:25.964 --> 01:08:28.174
I would not know what to say.

858
01:08:28.374 --> 01:08:29.967
Just tell the truth.

859
01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:31.761
Tell him that you love him.

860
01:08:33.346 --> 01:08:36.141
It's too late for that, Grace.

861
01:08:36.891 --> 01:08:39.653
Rick, if you still is breathing,

862
01:08:39.853 --> 01:08:43.148
never too late to say to
your son that you love him.


863
01:08:43.815 --> 01:08:46.034
I can't do this any more.

864
01:08:46.234 --> 01:08:49.112
You have no idea how much I
I would like to hug my son,


865
01:08:49.312 --> 01:08:50.372
To say that I love him,

866
01:08:50.572 --> 01:08:53.725
and I will always be by his side.

867
01:08:53.925 --> 01:08:57.078
You still have time. Please.

868
01:08:59.747 --> 01:09:02.629
You are a woman Special, Grace.

869
01:09:02.829 --> 01:09:05.512
You are a special man, Rick.

870
01:09:05.712 --> 01:09:09.674
And you are a father
who You need your son.


871
01:09:09.874 --> 01:09:12.594
Now, go there and do
it the right thing.


872
01:09:16.347 --> 01:09:18.558
Come on.

873
01:09:22.812 --> 01:09:26.399
So Rick is short for something
like Richard or Ricky?


874
01:09:26.599 --> 01:09:28.442
Yeah, diminutive of Ricky.

875
01:09:28.642 --> 01:09:30.286
My parents were born in Cuba.

876
01:09:30.486 --> 01:09:32.697
They loved watching "I love Lucy".

877
01:09:32.897 --> 01:09:33.957
Really?

878
01:09:34.157 --> 01:09:37.794
No, of course not, you fool.

879
01:09:37.994 --> 01:09:43.333
No, it's short for Richard
from a long line of Richards.


880
01:09:43.533 --> 01:09:45.552
But and you?

881
01:09:45.752 --> 01:09:47.320
Is your name short for Gracie?

882
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.088
Now you're making fun of me.

883
01:09:49.288 --> 01:09:50.381
Excuse me.

884
01:09:51.799 --> 01:09:53.092
No, when my parents met,

885
01:09:53.292 --> 01:09:55.270
they were missionaries.

886
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.680
They wanted me to remember
every day of blessing


887
01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:00.683
which is the life
and grace of God.


888
01:10:01.351 --> 01:10:02.894
It suits you.

889
01:10:03.094 --> 01:10:04.094
Thanks.

890
01:10:04.095 --> 01:10:05.672
I will take this as a compliment.

891
01:10:05.872 --> 01:10:07.482
You should take this
as a compliment.


892
01:10:07.682 --> 01:10:09.317
So are they what we will see?

893
01:10:09.517 --> 01:10:10.618
Who?

894
01:10:10.818 --> 01:10:13.238
Well you know all
this journey today.


895
01:10:13.438 --> 01:10:15.531
We are going see your parents?

896
01:10:15.731 --> 01:10:16.833
Oh no.

897
01:10:17.033 --> 01:10:19.748
My mother died about
two years ago.


898
01:10:19.948 --> 01:10:22.664
And my father, you You
already know the story.


899
01:10:23.206 --> 01:10:25.842
I'm so sorry.

900
01:10:26.042 --> 01:10:28.336
I really don't know how
You do that, Grace.


901
01:10:28.536 --> 01:10:29.596
This what?

902
01:10:29.796 --> 01:10:31.347
The way you keep your faith,

903
01:10:31.547 --> 01:10:37.637
I mean, despite all the Sad
things that happened to you As.


904
01:10:37.837 --> 01:10:40.231
I think only miss you tell me

905
01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:44.435
who is dying of a disease
rare tropical or something.


906
01:10:44.635 --> 01:10:47.689
Yeah, that wouldn't be serious.

907
01:10:56.197 --> 01:10:58.057
What's the rush, Grace?

908
01:10:58.257 --> 01:10:59.963
How did we get here?

909
01:11:00.163 --> 01:11:01.869
Come soon, we're almost there.

910
01:11:02.069 --> 01:11:03.129
Do not.

911
01:11:03.329 --> 01:11:05.540
I don't wanna go for
this one way, Grace.


912
01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.375
Grace.

913
01:11:08.293 --> 01:11:10.753
Grace?

914
01:11:19.804 --> 01:11:22.056
Here we are.

915
01:11:22.473 --> 01:11:23.975
Today is Action Day Thanks Rick.

916
01:11:24.175 --> 01:11:26.945
What day is better than this?

917
01:11:27.145 --> 01:11:28.817
Look I don't think
so I can do that.


918
01:11:29.017 --> 01:11:30.690
Your child needs from
you and you from him.


919
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:32.775
Of course you can do it.

920
01:11:32.975 --> 01:11:34.902
What if he hates me?

921
01:11:35.102 --> 01:11:37.030
This is impossible.

922
01:11:51.002 --> 01:11:53.254
Fine.

923
01:11:56.424 --> 01:11:58.601
Mother?

924
01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:03.765
I knew it.

925
01:12:06.434 --> 01:12:08.227
Happy Thanksgiving Thanks, Mum.

926
01:12:08.427 --> 01:12:10.238
Yes it is.

927
01:12:10.438 --> 01:12:12.190
My God, where is my education

928
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:13.399
I am Anne.

929
01:12:13.599 --> 01:12:14.784
Grace.

930
01:12:14.984 --> 01:12:16.277
What a lovely name.

931
01:12:16.477 --> 01:12:17.477
Thanks.

932
01:12:17.478 --> 01:12:19.072
You should have said
that would bring visit.


933
01:12:19.272 --> 01:12:20.623
I am a mess.

934
01:12:20.823 --> 01:12:22.283
My God, you're cold.

935
01:12:22.483 --> 01:12:23.483
Come in. Come in.

936
01:12:23.484 --> 01:12:24.619
Are you hungry?

937
01:12:24.819 --> 01:12:25.819
Yes a lot.

938
01:12:25.828 --> 01:12:26.828
I have so much food.

939
01:12:26.913 --> 01:12:28.247
Please come in, I'll
heat something up.


940
01:12:28.447 --> 01:12:29.447
Mum. Mum.

941
01:12:29.448 --> 01:12:30.508
What?

942
01:12:30.708 --> 01:12:31.843
Is Luke here?

943
01:12:32.043 --> 01:12:34.253
He is in the neighbour
Playing with friends.


944
01:12:34.453 --> 01:12:36.714
But you know, he'll be back soon.

945
01:12:36.914 --> 01:12:39.175
So please come eat.

946
01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:41.552
O my God.

947
01:12:52.397 --> 01:12:56.275
So tell me, when did you meet?

948
01:12:56.475 --> 01:12:58.485
When was it?

949
01:12:58.685 --> 01:13:00.496
Was it noon?

950
01:13:00.696 --> 01:13:02.348
I think it was an hour.

951
01:13:02.548 --> 01:13:04.200
One hour? It's close to that.

952
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.202
Why, you freaks.

953
01:13:34.355 --> 01:13:35.548
Here we go.

954
01:13:35.748 --> 01:13:36.941
Women first.

955
01:13:37.141 --> 01:13:38.141
Thank you.

956
01:13:38.234 --> 01:13:39.234
Sure, mum, awesome.

957
01:13:39.235 --> 01:13:40.820
Look, I don't know if I
can eat nothing else.


958
01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.405
So do me a favour and try, okay?

959
01:13:42.605 --> 01:13:43.873
Fine.

960
01:13:44.073 --> 01:13:46.701
It's been so long since
I ate home-made pie.


961
01:13:46.901 --> 01:13:47.901
Is so good.

962
01:13:47.952 --> 01:13:50.413
Well, there's a lot more than
where this one came from.


963
01:13:59.922 --> 01:14:02.300
Hi son.

964
01:14:06.095 --> 01:14:08.514
What are you doing here?

965
01:14:09.015 --> 01:14:12.560
Wow, look at you.

966
01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.445
It grew so fast.

967
01:14:14.645 --> 01:14:17.732
Of course, if you think
that Five years is fast.


968
01:14:22.153 --> 01:14:25.139
I brought something for you.

969
01:14:25.339 --> 01:14:28.326
Look, do you remember that here?

970
01:14:30.703 --> 01:14:34.257
Do you think that would
it be all right?


971
01:14:34.457 --> 01:14:39.045
Do you think you can give me a hug
and pretend to be my father again?


972
01:14:39.245 --> 01:14:40.555
That would be cool.

973
01:14:40.755 --> 01:14:43.007
This will not happen.

974
01:14:43.758 --> 01:14:46.311
And thanks for showing up, Dad.

975
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:48.438
See you again in five years.

976
01:14:48.638 --> 01:14:51.891
Luke honey why don't you sit
here with us and eat some pie?


977
01:14:52.091 --> 01:14:53.693
Luke

978
01:14:53.893 --> 01:14:55.862
Just go away.

979
01:14:56.062 --> 01:14:58.397
We're much better off without you.

980
01:15:02.193 --> 01:15:03.240
He hates me.

981
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.440
No, no.

982
01:15:04.487 --> 01:15:06.614
He just needs some time,
just as you needed it.


983
01:15:06.814 --> 01:15:08.699
Just don't give up so easy.

984
01:15:08.899 --> 01:15:11.244
Now it's his turn.

985
01:15:14.121 --> 01:15:16.415
I am very proud of you.

986
01:16:16.767 --> 01:16:19.270
Luke?

987
01:16:24.442 --> 01:16:26.902
Luke?

988
01:16:31.782 --> 01:16:33.784
Look, buddy.

989
01:16:35.578 --> 01:16:38.414
I just wanted to tell
you I'm so sorry.


990
01:16:40.791 --> 01:16:41.792
I know I screwed up.

991
01:16:41.992 --> 01:16:44.003
I know.

992
01:16:44.921 --> 01:16:49.592
I know I don't I
was a good father.


993
01:16:54.555 --> 01:16:57.475
I won't ask you to forgive me.

994
01:16:57.675 --> 01:16:58.675
I know I don't deserve it.

995
01:16:58.759 --> 01:17:00.978
I just...

996
01:17:06.651 --> 01:17:10.112
I will not leave you
again, Luke, never.


997
01:17:12.031 --> 01:17:16.410
I'll always be here for you, ok?

998
01:17:25.503 --> 01:17:28.714
Maybe one day, when you are ready,

999
01:17:28.914 --> 01:17:34.512
we can talk.

1000
01:17:44.146 --> 01:17:46.148
I love you son.

1001
01:18:18.597 --> 01:18:19.857
Hey.

1002
01:18:20.057 --> 01:18:21.559
And then?

1003
01:18:22.977 --> 01:18:25.020
Oh good.

1004
01:18:26.105 --> 01:18:27.944
I have to take you.

1005
01:18:28.144 --> 01:18:29.784
Can you lend me the car?

1006
01:18:29.984 --> 01:18:32.278
Of course, just let
me get the key.


1007
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:36.912
Thank you.

1008
01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:38.473
For what?

1009
01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:39.835
Do you know.

1010
01:18:40.035 --> 01:18:44.999
Being who you are, and you know,

1011
01:18:45.199 --> 01:18:47.585
for everything today.

1012
01:18:47.785 --> 01:18:49.712
You're welcome.

1013
01:18:50.171 --> 01:18:52.631
- Here it is and your coat.
- Thank you.


1014
01:18:52.831 --> 01:18:54.141
- Great.
- All well.


1015
01:18:54.341 --> 01:18:56.302
Good, Grace, I know I just met you

1016
01:18:56.502 --> 01:18:57.645
but always feel at home,

1017
01:18:57.845 --> 01:19:00.598
because you are very
welcome here anytime.


1018
01:19:00.798 --> 01:19:02.975
Thanks.

1019
01:19:04.935 --> 01:19:06.145
I'll be right back, okay, mum?

1020
01:19:06.345 --> 01:19:07.345
I promise.

1021
01:19:08.764 --> 01:19:09.764
Goodbye.

1022
01:19:09.774 --> 01:19:10.825
Bye Bye.

1023
01:19:11.025 --> 01:19:13.027
Drive carefully.

1024
01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:54.985
Can you can turn left?

1025
01:19:55.185 --> 01:19:56.862
Left?

1026
01:20:01.075 --> 01:20:02.585
What are we doing?

1027
01:20:02.785 --> 01:20:04.912
I thought you were
See your family.


1028
01:20:05.112 --> 01:20:06.580
I will go.

1029
01:20:42.241 --> 01:20:44.577
I want that Meet my family.

1030
01:20:44.777 --> 01:20:46.954
Fine.

1031
01:20:56.422 --> 01:20:58.966
I don't know what to say, Grace.

1032
01:21:01.677 --> 01:21:05.514
My husband never
returned from the war.


1033
01:21:08.017 --> 01:21:12.438
He was killed soon after
that Tommy drowned.


1034
01:21:15.357 --> 01:21:17.401
I'm so sorry.

1035
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:20.863
I miss them so much.

1036
01:21:23.115 --> 01:21:25.659
Happy Thanksgiving, Tom.

1037
01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.664
This is Rick.

1038
01:21:33.042 --> 01:21:37.171
If not for him, probably I
wouldn't be here today.


1039
01:21:45.095 --> 01:21:48.098
Grace, the date when
your husband died,


1040
01:21:48.724 --> 01:21:50.025
It's the same day.

1041
01:21:50.225 --> 01:21:53.062
Yes, it's been five years today.

1042
01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:58.067
That is a sign, isn't it?

1043
01:22:01.195 --> 01:22:04.323
Everything that happened
today should happen.


1044
01:22:04.523 --> 01:22:07.042
Isn't it, Grace?

1045
01:22:07.242 --> 01:22:11.038
It's like you said, nothing
It happens by chance.


1046
01:22:17.461 --> 01:22:20.506
It's God, isn't it?

1047
01:22:21.215 --> 01:22:24.093
I said you had that
work your faith.


1048
01:22:25.511 --> 01:22:28.555
You were right.

1049
01:22:34.770 --> 01:22:37.272
You were right, Grace.

1050
01:22:39.483 --> 01:22:41.744
My God.

1051
01:22:41.944 --> 01:22:44.947
I can feel the accelerated heart.

1052
01:22:45.147 --> 01:22:48.325
It's for you, Grace.

1053
01:22:48.525 --> 01:22:51.704
It's because of you.

1054
01:23:16.729 --> 01:23:19.073
Hi darling.

1055
01:23:19.273 --> 01:23:22.192
I miss you.

1056
01:23:24.028 --> 01:23:26.847
I met someone.

1057
01:23:27.047 --> 01:23:29.667
Her name is Grace.

1058
01:23:29.867 --> 01:23:32.832
We are taking a day at a time,

1059
01:23:33.032 --> 01:23:35.998
But I have a good one feeling.

1060
01:23:37.291 --> 01:23:41.083
I'm telling you why I can't not

1061
01:23:41.283 --> 01:23:44.817
think you looked for
me all this time.


1062
01:23:45.017 --> 01:23:48.552
And maybe all this has
been because of you.


1063
01:23:48.752 --> 01:23:50.971
Then, dad, come on.

1064
01:23:52.473 --> 01:23:55.647
Good anyway, I need to go.

1065
01:23:55.847 --> 01:23:59.021
I'm playing ball with our son.

1066
01:24:01.190 --> 01:24:05.402
See you soon, I promise.

1067
01:24:08.739 --> 01:24:11.408
I love you.

1068
01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:35.538
SAVED BY GRACE
