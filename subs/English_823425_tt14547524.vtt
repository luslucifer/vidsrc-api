00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:25.013
[narrator]
Get your popcorn ready,


2
00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:27.248
'cause this is about
to be a good one.


3
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:29.684
Down here in New Orleans,
you know we know how to party.


4
00:00:29.818 --> 00:00:31.219
And around here,
we like to say,


5
00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:33.087
"Laissez les
bons temps rouler."


6
00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:37.859
The wait is over.

7
00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:40.862
A sold-out Superdome
is the stage.


8
00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:45.900
After a year
of partially filled
or empty stadiums,


9
00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:48.536
this should be
absolutely electric.


10
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.739
College football's Snickers
National Title game


11
00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:52.607
has finally arrived,

12
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:54.776
and it is the matchup
of our dreams.


13
00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.611
We have the 13-1 Cougars

14
00:00:56.745 --> 00:00:58.980
going against
the undefeated Wolves,


15
00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:02.050
and this is where
legends are made.


16
00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:04.986
[Nick Wright] Wolves
quarterback, the Heisman
Trophy winner LeMarcus James.


17
00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.055
Possibly
the best quarterback


18
00:01:07.188 --> 00:01:09.758
to come into the NFL
since Patrick Mahomes.


19
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:12.226
[reporter] And you know
who agrees with me
on that? Miami.


20
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.763
'Cause they're poised to
take him number one overall,


21
00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:17.766
and I'm hearing for about
$35 million guaranteed.


22
00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.567
Meanwhile,
for the Cougars,


23
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:21.335
you have running back
Cecil Burgess,


24
00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.237
AKA the Haitian Hammer.

25
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.640
He's gonna run for,
eh, I don't know,


26
00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:28.342
200 to 400 yards
every game.


27
00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:29.978
That's how he set
the Big 12


28
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:31.612
all-time single-season
rushing record.


29
00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:33.848
But the people
who really build


30
00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:36.284
the college football
dynasties are the coaches.


31
00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:39.988
We are not talking enough
about Wolves coach
James Lazor.


32
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:43.624
Everybody knows the guy is
an elite program builder,


33
00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:46.460
one of the best coaches
we've seen,


34
00:01:46.594 --> 00:01:49.530
but he has never
won the big game.


35
00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:52.767
Monday night is about etching
his name in the history books.


36
00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.537
[Wright] You have
legacies on the line.


37
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:58.639
You have controversies
surrounding the sport
as a whole.


38
00:01:58.773 --> 00:02:02.176
Monday cannot get here
soon enough


39
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.313
for the college football
national title game.


40
00:02:13.554 --> 00:02:15.356
[person coughs]

41
00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.858
[tapping]

42
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:18.126
[person sniffs]

43
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.597
[tapping continues
intermittently]


44
00:02:31.172 --> 00:02:32.707
[exhales forcefully]

45
00:02:55.163 --> 00:02:56.898
[person] You hear that?

46
00:02:57.966 --> 00:02:59.801
The poppin'?
[bones popping]


47
00:03:03.337 --> 00:03:06.574
Was an elbow-to-helmet with
Michigan State's Will backer.


48
00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:08.877
I-right, simple, 68 blast.

49
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.611
[football taps]
Wham.


50
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.415
Darn thing
ain't been right since.


51
00:03:16.017 --> 00:03:17.385
[LeMarcus] Lead.

52
00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:19.487
Hmm?

53
00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:21.756
It was 1-41 lead.

54
00:03:23.624 --> 00:03:25.326
Hmm, pretty sure...

55
00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.830
If you were
on the second level,
then you were lead blocking.


56
00:03:28.963 --> 00:03:32.066
Michigan State ran
a Chicago 53
with a robber in the box.


57
00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:36.070
I mean, no way you got to
the Will back on the blast.


58
00:03:36.204 --> 00:03:37.705
Hmm?

59
00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:39.440
Could've been lead.

60
00:03:43.677 --> 00:03:45.379
[LeMarcus sighs]

61
00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:55.824
"The path
of the righteous man


62
00:03:57.458 --> 00:03:59.828
is beset on all sides

63
00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:01.830
by the inequities
of the selfish


64
00:04:02.997 --> 00:04:05.633
and the tyranny
of evil men."


65
00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:10.805
"Blessed is he who,
in the name of good will,


66
00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.941
shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness."


67
00:04:13.074 --> 00:04:14.375
Hmm?

68
00:04:14.508 --> 00:04:16.144
"For he is
his brother's keeper


69
00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:17.979
and the finder
of lost children."


70
00:04:18.112 --> 00:04:22.316
"And I will strike them down
with vengeance
and furious anger


71
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.786
those who attempt to poison
and destroy my brothers."


72
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.190
[both] "And you will know
my name is the Lord,


73
00:04:29.323 --> 00:04:32.226
for I lay my finger
upon thee."


74
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.429
[both imitate gunshots, grunt]

75
00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:39.834
[gasps dramatically]

76
00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:42.670
[both laughing]

77
00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:47.241
You stupid, man.

78
00:04:48.342 --> 00:04:50.578
That was an Oscar-winning
performance.


79
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:52.113
Shit.

80
00:04:52.246 --> 00:04:54.648
Ah, shit, ol' Quentin
sure can write 'em.


81
00:04:54.782 --> 00:04:56.517
Yeah, he can. [chuckles]

82
00:04:57.986 --> 00:04:59.653
Damn.

83
00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:03.491
Hey, you turn
your location services off?


84
00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:07.561
Yeah. On the iPad too.

85
00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:10.631
We can still call
this whole thing off.


86
00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:12.967
Chalk it up
as a research project.


87
00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:16.537
Get some grad credits
out of it.


88
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.806
Hell, I think we'd be
halfway to our master's.


89
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.241
[scoffs]

90
00:05:27.548 --> 00:05:29.350
Bow your head, man.

91
00:05:33.454 --> 00:05:34.889
[grunts softly]

92
00:05:36.224 --> 00:05:38.359
[LeMarcus sighs]

93
00:05:38.492 --> 00:05:43.331
God, give us the wisdom
to see the path
we must take,


94
00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:45.499
and give us the courage
to brave it.


95
00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:48.302
Make of us a light.

96
00:05:50.404 --> 00:05:52.140
Amen.
Amen.


97
00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:57.411
You're getting better
with that.


98
00:06:03.017 --> 00:06:04.218
[sighs]

99
00:06:12.526 --> 00:06:13.594
[sighs]

100
00:06:15.063 --> 00:06:16.264
We're live.

101
00:06:22.403 --> 00:06:24.172
We'd best
get a move-on then.


102
00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:27.508
Coach's gonna become
a heat-seeking missile
looking for you.


103
00:06:28.376 --> 00:06:29.410
Yeah.

104
00:06:30.678 --> 00:06:33.114
I just hope he understands
this ain't about him.


105
00:06:36.017 --> 00:06:38.719
[commentator on TV]
Burgess, able to break away,


106
00:06:38.852 --> 00:06:40.621
into the secondary.

107
00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:42.856
Breaks another tackle...
Stop right there, Lukie.


108
00:06:42.991 --> 00:06:44.758
[keyboard clacks]
Right there.


109
00:06:44.892 --> 00:06:47.461
This is
what I'm talking about.
Simple stretch sweep to 34.


110
00:06:47.595 --> 00:06:49.463
Lukie, zoom on 34.

111
00:06:50.731 --> 00:06:54.068
There. Right ankle dominant cut
around the left corner.


112
00:06:54.202 --> 00:06:55.903
The best running back
in the country


113
00:06:56.037 --> 00:06:58.772
is turning the corner
on an inside ankle lead.


114
00:06:58.906 --> 00:07:01.509
Why? 34's left ankle
ain't right.


115
00:07:01.642 --> 00:07:03.411
It hasn't been
since week ten.


116
00:07:03.544 --> 00:07:06.380
Okay, real quick.
Cecil scores
on this play, right?


117
00:07:06.514 --> 00:07:09.083
Yeah. Eighty-yard sprint,
where he outruns a free safety.


118
00:07:09.217 --> 00:07:11.419
Yeah, against Vanderbilt,
I could outrun a free safety.


119
00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:14.722
So here's what we do.
If we move Cornelius
to the middle,


120
00:07:14.855 --> 00:07:16.157
we pinch in the OLBs,

121
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.392
we got our safeties thinking
run support first.


122
00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:20.361
Cornelius will
eat his lunch,


123
00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:22.730
and we will shut 34 down
for the night.


124
00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:24.032
I got you.

125
00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:26.467
Boys. Booster club dinner.
Five minutes.


126
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.969
Yeah, yeah, they can wait.
No, they cannot wait.


127
00:07:29.103 --> 00:07:30.904
They're the team owners.
You're the guest of honor.


128
00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:32.873
Luke can babysit the film,
right, baby?


129
00:07:33.007 --> 00:07:34.808
Tell you what. You can
come back here tonight.


130
00:07:34.942 --> 00:07:37.411
You guys can touch
and watch film
all night long. How's that?


131
00:07:37.545 --> 00:07:39.980
Seventy-two hours till
the national goddamn title game,


132
00:07:40.114 --> 00:07:42.583
and I got to parade around
in this dog-and-pony show.


133
00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:44.718
Heavy is the head that wears
the crown, my Lord.


134
00:07:44.852 --> 00:07:46.620
All right, look, I gotta
go get dressed, man,


135
00:07:46.754 --> 00:07:48.956
get ready for this
dog-and-pony show,
as you call it.


136
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.159
Seriously, you're not going
to back me up here at all?


137
00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:53.127
No, I'm not.
I just do your defense.


138
00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:55.963
That's your own offense.
That's your life offense.


139
00:07:56.097 --> 00:07:57.998
[laughs]
Defense right here.


140
00:07:58.132 --> 00:07:59.800
I made these
short and sweet,
like you like it.


141
00:07:59.933 --> 00:08:01.669
I suggest you do the same
with your jokes.


142
00:08:01.802 --> 00:08:04.372
My jokes are hilarious,
and people love them.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.


143
00:08:06.807 --> 00:08:09.009
Stop.
Personal phone.


144
00:08:09.143 --> 00:08:11.712
Give me the personal phone.
Luke gets the business phone.


145
00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:13.547
Give him
the business phone.


146
00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:15.483
Anything comes in,
you know where to find me.


147
00:08:15.616 --> 00:08:17.885
You need to relax.
Let's enjoy the mountaintop.


148
00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:20.888
I'll enjoy the mountaintop
when we are at the mountaintop.
We're not there yet.


149
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:22.923
Let's go. Can we go?

150
00:08:23.057 --> 00:08:24.392
Yes. Okay.

151
00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.160
Lukie, set all staff
for 7:00 a.m.


152
00:08:26.294 --> 00:08:28.829
Bed check on time.
On time.


153
00:08:28.962 --> 00:08:30.231
Will do.

154
00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:33.767
[person]
Bed check. Let's go!


155
00:08:33.901 --> 00:08:35.769
[indistinct chattering]

156
00:08:39.973 --> 00:08:42.042
Hey, guys,
get in y'all room, man.
[knock on door]


157
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:44.878
-What up, Scotty?
-Yo, what up, Orlando?


158
00:08:45.012 --> 00:08:46.914
Is Walton in there too?
Yeah, he in the bathroom.


159
00:08:47.047 --> 00:08:48.216
Let's get some rest.

160
00:08:48.349 --> 00:08:49.783
Talk to you later, man.
For sure.


161
00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:52.120
[laughing, chattering]
[bottles clink]


162
00:08:52.253 --> 00:08:54.988
Hey, Coach, check them
back there for me.
Sure.


163
00:08:56.457 --> 00:08:57.758
[knocks]

164
00:08:57.891 --> 00:09:00.394
Yo, LJ, Em.
It's Scotty. Open up.


165
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.598
Come on, guys,
stop playing. Open up.


166
00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:26.287
[foil crinkling]

167
00:09:30.758 --> 00:09:32.760
[cell phone ringing]

168
00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:34.295
That's bed check.

169
00:09:37.198 --> 00:09:38.466
Yo, Scotty.

170
00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:41.469
I'm already asleep, man.

171
00:09:41.602 --> 00:09:43.537
Yeah. Sunday's snoring
like an ox.


172
00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:45.773
Can you hear him?
[imitates snoring]


173
00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:48.609
He broke his nose
so many times,


174
00:09:48.742 --> 00:09:50.578
once he gets
on his back,
I'm screwed.


175
00:09:50.711 --> 00:09:53.781
Yeah. 8:00 a.m. sprints
in the bubble.


176
00:09:53.914 --> 00:09:55.149
Got it.

177
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.785
He buy it?
Hell, yeah.


178
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.093
Thank God Snickers sponsored
this game and not
some insurance company.


179
00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:08.762
You hungry?

180
00:10:08.896 --> 00:10:10.097
No.

181
00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:14.101
[sighs]

182
00:10:24.612 --> 00:10:26.447
[laughter]
[Coach Lazor]
I'm telling you,


183
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.250
I know they don't have
boosters this good looking
in the Big 12.


184
00:10:29.383 --> 00:10:32.220
[all laughing]
I know the Cougars
don't look this good.


185
00:10:33.787 --> 00:10:35.856
We have built this program
into a juggernaut.


186
00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:38.726
Two consecutive
conference championships,


187
00:10:38.859 --> 00:10:40.694
two consecutive
play-off berths,


188
00:10:40.828 --> 00:10:42.530
and now...
[audience applauding]


189
00:10:42.663 --> 00:10:44.932
...for the first time
in program history,


190
00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:49.637
we are headed to our first
national title game.


191
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.605
[cheering]

192
00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:56.310
All of you in this room,

193
00:10:56.444 --> 00:10:59.280
you have supported,
pushed and prodded,


194
00:10:59.413 --> 00:11:01.882
and sometimes much,
much worse.


195
00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:04.318
[laughing]
But I appreciate it.


196
00:11:04.452 --> 00:11:06.554
That's how you grow.

197
00:11:06.687 --> 00:11:10.090
And I appreciate the opportunity
to have presided over this,


198
00:11:10.224 --> 00:11:14.027
to help young men
become champions


199
00:11:14.161 --> 00:11:16.297
on and off
the football field.


200
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:17.765
Go, Pack!

201
00:11:17.898 --> 00:11:19.900
[cheering]

202
00:11:21.702 --> 00:11:24.004
[music playing on speakers]
[indistinct chattering]


203
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.413
You're seriously pressing
your bet again?


204
00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:34.682
Half a million dollars?

205
00:11:34.815 --> 00:11:37.084
Come on, Roger, you know me.
It's for the title.


206
00:11:37.217 --> 00:11:39.687
Go big or go home,
and I ain't fucking leaving.


207
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.890
Well, the apple sure
didn't fall far
from the tree with you.


208
00:11:43.023 --> 00:11:45.058
God bless
your daddy's soul.


209
00:11:45.192 --> 00:11:48.529
Old Fred used to like to
bet the house in Vegas.
[chuckles]


210
00:11:48.662 --> 00:11:50.698
He just liked
the free drinks.
Well, hear, hear.


211
00:11:50.831 --> 00:11:53.100
Question is,
how in the glorious hell


212
00:11:53.233 --> 00:11:54.868
are we gonna stop
Cecil Burgess?


213
00:11:55.002 --> 00:11:56.704
Fastest I seen
since Herschel.


214
00:11:56.837 --> 00:11:58.138
It's me,

215
00:11:58.272 --> 00:11:59.940
I'm flooding the gaps,

216
00:12:00.073 --> 00:12:02.009
bringing Mack
from the strong side


217
00:12:02.142 --> 00:12:04.578
and feeding Cornelius
raw meat till kickoff.


218
00:12:04.712 --> 00:12:06.947
Or we break in his room
and Tonya Harding
that son of a bitch.


219
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.450
Now, aren't you sweet?
[chuckles]


220
00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:11.452
Well, as long as we got
LeMarcus back there


221
00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:13.754
firing bullets,
we'll be fine--
better than fine.


222
00:12:13.887 --> 00:12:16.390
Coach, we was just talking
about LeMarcus.


223
00:12:16.524 --> 00:12:17.691
LeMarcus who?

224
00:12:17.825 --> 00:12:19.226
[laughter]
But I'll tell you what,


225
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.595
he was pretty raw
when we found him,


226
00:12:21.729 --> 00:12:25.699
and obviously, he's
developed into something
really, really special.


227
00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:29.136
You think you can convince him
he ain't ready to jump
for another year?


228
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:31.472
I'm just gonna support
whatever is best for LeMarcus.


229
00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:33.374
[Rodger] Amen.
[Taylor] Coach,
I got a kid in Little Rock.


230
00:12:33.507 --> 00:12:35.443
Hell of an arm. Got to show
you some videos of him.


231
00:12:35.576 --> 00:12:38.245
[Coach Lazor] Love to see it.
You remember
the bad old days


232
00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:40.314
when we were scraping
the bottom of the barrel,


233
00:12:40.448 --> 00:12:43.951
begging JUCO transfers
with cases of Budweiser


234
00:12:44.084 --> 00:12:45.586
and jobs
with the dealership?


235
00:12:45.719 --> 00:12:47.621
[Coach Lazor]
Yeah, all too well.


236
00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:49.823
[Taylor] And all that changed
once you got LeMarcus.
[Rodger] Bullshit.


237
00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:51.859
All that changed
when we got Coach here.


238
00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:53.794
Hey, Coach.
Kevin McDonald.
Hi, Kevin.


239
00:12:53.927 --> 00:12:55.329
Director of Communication
for the CFP.


240
00:12:55.463 --> 00:12:57.064
Good to meet you,
and thanks for everything.


241
00:12:57.197 --> 00:13:00.534
Sure. Uh, we may have
a situation.


242
00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:03.837
LeMarcus just tweeted this
earlier tonight.


243
00:13:05.238 --> 00:13:07.941
It says he's boycotting
the game.


244
00:13:08.075 --> 00:13:10.611
Reporters are
already swarming.


245
00:13:10.744 --> 00:13:13.313
We're trying to keep them
off the players' floor.


246
00:13:13.447 --> 00:13:16.116
Can probably do that
till morning,


247
00:13:16.249 --> 00:13:18.185
but this can get
out of hand fast.


248
00:13:18.318 --> 00:13:19.953
It won't.
Give me 20 minutes.


249
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.996
Guys, I'll see you right back.
[chuckles]


250
00:13:40.273 --> 00:13:41.409
Hey.

251
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.177
Hi.

252
00:13:45.546 --> 00:13:47.915
A poet at a football game.

253
00:13:49.182 --> 00:13:51.385
Philosopher
at a football game.


254
00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.654
[both chuckle]
Anyway...


255
00:13:56.724 --> 00:13:58.459
You look fantastic.

256
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.229
[chuckles]

257
00:14:02.362 --> 00:14:05.332
Scotty, we sure
this is the room?
Yeah, Coach.


258
00:14:05.466 --> 00:14:07.701
Okay, and they were here
at bed check?


259
00:14:07.835 --> 00:14:10.203
Yeah, they're marked off.
What the fuck does that mean,
"They're marked off"?


260
00:14:10.337 --> 00:14:12.740
Did somebody see 'em?
No. But I spoke to LJ
on the phone.


261
00:14:12.873 --> 00:14:14.808
What the fuck?
You ain't seen nobody...


262
00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:16.877
You don't do bed check
on the goddamn telephone.


263
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.946
You check the goddamn bed.
For Christ's sake.


264
00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:21.749
Goddamn it!
Bailey's got my phone.


265
00:14:21.882 --> 00:14:24.017
Your work one.
Yes. Thank you.


266
00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:26.119
Jesus Christ, man.
We're in New Orleans.


267
00:14:26.253 --> 00:14:28.989
Walking distance
to the Quarter
with LeMarcus James.


268
00:14:29.122 --> 00:14:32.793
You might want to actually check
that he's in bed at bed check.


269
00:14:32.926 --> 00:14:35.062
When's the last time
did y'all see him?
Come on, now.


270
00:14:35.195 --> 00:14:37.230
Huh?
When he got off the bus.


271
00:14:37.364 --> 00:14:40.033
Hey, LeMarcus, it's Coach.
Just hit me back here
on the work cell, okay?


272
00:14:40.167 --> 00:14:41.869
If you're out and about,
no problem.


273
00:14:42.002 --> 00:14:43.904
Just, uh, checking in, okay?

274
00:14:44.037 --> 00:14:45.773
We'll see you
for a.m. sprints, man.


275
00:14:45.906 --> 00:14:47.941
Goddamn it.
There's the guy
with the key, Coach.


276
00:14:48.075 --> 00:14:49.477
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:50.944
All right.

278
00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:53.346
[sighs]

279
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:55.015
LeMarcus. Emmett.

280
00:14:57.117 --> 00:14:59.086
Goddamn it.

281
00:14:59.219 --> 00:15:01.121
What the...

282
00:15:01.254 --> 00:15:04.958
Well, I guess we just knock
on every goddamn door
at the hotel.


283
00:15:05.092 --> 00:15:07.194
We got to find him.
Let's go. Go, go, go.


284
00:15:07.327 --> 00:15:09.096
Wake everybody up
if you have to.


285
00:15:09.229 --> 00:15:10.531
Shit.

286
00:15:10.664 --> 00:15:13.333
[indistinct conversations]

287
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:24.878
[Coach Dunn]
Come on, Cornelius,
open up the door. Hey.


288
00:15:25.012 --> 00:15:27.447
Fuck. Hold on.
[bottle clinks]


289
00:15:28.716 --> 00:15:30.283
What do you want, Coach?

290
00:15:31.952 --> 00:15:33.954
What the fuck
is that smell?


291
00:15:34.087 --> 00:15:36.289
That's Payton's ass
after Popeyes.


292
00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:40.661
There something you need?
Look, have you
seen LeMarcus?


293
00:15:40.794 --> 00:15:42.663
Why the fuck
would I know where he's at?


294
00:15:42.796 --> 00:15:44.932
What's going on?
It's nothing for you
to worry about.


295
00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:46.934
Just be ready for sprints
in the morning.


296
00:15:47.067 --> 00:15:49.002
Nasty-ass kids.

297
00:16:06.486 --> 00:16:07.888
[LeMarcus] Yo, Orlando.

298
00:16:10.924 --> 00:16:12.492
How drunk are you, man?

299
00:16:13.493 --> 00:16:15.462
I haven't drank
in four months.


300
00:16:15.596 --> 00:16:16.697
Where's your phone?

301
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.432
In the room, like you asked.

302
00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:21.535
But what the fuck
is this, LJ?


303
00:16:22.369 --> 00:16:24.337
It's exactly what I said.

304
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:26.273
I ain't playing
until they pay us.


305
00:16:26.406 --> 00:16:28.008
What? You broke again?

306
00:16:28.141 --> 00:16:30.578
You hurt?
I'm done.


307
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:33.681
They're here making billions
while the rest of us
make scraps.


308
00:16:33.814 --> 00:16:37.651
Me and you, we could sell
our names. What about
everybody else, huh?


309
00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:40.588
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

310
00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:42.656
Hold up, hold up.

311
00:16:44.457 --> 00:16:46.694
So you gonna sit
the national title game


312
00:16:46.827 --> 00:16:48.962
so some punt-coverage
Wayne Burnett gets...


313
00:16:49.096 --> 00:16:51.632
A real piece, yeah.
[chuckles]


314
00:16:53.133 --> 00:16:54.367
Shit.

315
00:16:55.869 --> 00:16:58.205
LJ, you need
to think about this, bruh.


316
00:16:58.338 --> 00:17:00.040
You and crazy-
Bible-Belt-Sunday


317
00:17:00.173 --> 00:17:01.875
gonna get laughed
out the building.


318
00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:04.211
And if you're lucky, what?
You gonna post on Twitter,


319
00:17:04.344 --> 00:17:07.681
and the whole fucking
machine gonna go,
"Okay, okay. We give up.


320
00:17:07.815 --> 00:17:11.051
LeMarcus doesn't want to play.
Let's just make him happy."


321
00:17:11.184 --> 00:17:14.421
I ain't who you think I am.
[scoffs]


322
00:17:14.554 --> 00:17:18.425
So you weren't the one
who gave us all 'Rona


323
00:17:18.558 --> 00:17:21.695
after fucking
half the campus
during quarantine?


324
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:23.631
You ain't tested
with your own piss
in three years.


325
00:17:23.764 --> 00:17:27.200
All your cash going up in smoke
or to that shit in your ears.


326
00:17:27.334 --> 00:17:29.236
So you standing on stage
for one protest


327
00:17:29.369 --> 00:17:31.672
for Instagram and pussy

328
00:17:31.805 --> 00:17:33.874
don't make you Malcolm X,
brother.


329
00:17:34.007 --> 00:17:36.744
Ain't nobody marching
in the streets


330
00:17:36.877 --> 00:17:38.746
for the number one pick.

331
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.048
[sighs]

332
00:17:43.684 --> 00:17:46.553
Look, man,
you're a great quarterback--


333
00:17:46.687 --> 00:17:48.221
and I'm gonna keep it 100
with you:


334
00:17:48.355 --> 00:17:49.790
one of the best
I've ever seen.


335
00:17:49.923 --> 00:17:51.458
But this shit?

336
00:17:53.827 --> 00:17:54.995
Uh-uh.

337
00:17:56.363 --> 00:17:58.165
You gonna embarrass
yourself, bruh.


338
00:18:01.468 --> 00:18:03.971
Look, man, you ain't
gotta come with me.


339
00:18:04.104 --> 00:18:06.940
All I'm asking is that
you don't come out against me.


340
00:18:08.608 --> 00:18:09.977
[sighs]

341
00:18:12.713 --> 00:18:13.981
All right.

342
00:18:14.114 --> 00:18:16.016
I'll watch this show
as long as you want,


343
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:18.251
but I ain't gettin'
a hundred yards from it.


344
00:18:28.295 --> 00:18:30.030
Good luck.

345
00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:40.640
[country music playing
on speaker]


346
00:18:40.774 --> 00:18:42.776
[heavy breathing]

347
00:18:56.423 --> 00:18:59.192
Mmm, I cannot believe
that you are here,


348
00:18:59.326 --> 00:19:00.660
you little sneak.

349
00:19:00.794 --> 00:19:02.162
[chuckles]

350
00:19:02.295 --> 00:19:04.464
You know
you love surprises.


351
00:19:04.597 --> 00:19:06.499
I do. I do.

352
00:19:06.633 --> 00:19:08.135
I just...

353
00:19:08.268 --> 00:19:10.704
I just wish you had a seat
next to me at the game.


354
00:19:10.838 --> 00:19:12.873
That's not exactly
the reason I came.


355
00:19:13.006 --> 00:19:15.408
[laughs]
Fine by me.


356
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.211
[sighs]

357
00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:22.816
I'm gonna take the job.

358
00:19:23.917 --> 00:19:25.819
Get a break
from the university.


359
00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:29.189
Rome?

360
00:19:30.724 --> 00:19:33.660
Hard to turn down
a year teaching abroad.


361
00:19:33.794 --> 00:19:35.428
Yeah.

362
00:19:35.562 --> 00:19:38.665
Yeah, I get that.
I totally get that.


363
00:19:41.301 --> 00:19:45.739
I just had one little,
tiny little question,
Mr. Poet.


364
00:19:48.241 --> 00:19:50.744
Or is it "philosopher"?

365
00:19:50.878 --> 00:19:53.914
What about us?

366
00:19:55.315 --> 00:19:57.250
We're a hotel-room
romance.


367
00:19:57.384 --> 00:19:58.919
Well, now you're just
being a dick.


368
00:19:59.052 --> 00:20:01.388
You know
what I'm saying.
Fuck you.


369
00:20:01.521 --> 00:20:02.956
Come visit.

370
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.425
"Come visit." Grazie.

371
00:20:06.426 --> 00:20:08.261
[chuckles]

372
00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:15.002
I don't know.

373
00:20:17.004 --> 00:20:18.538
Maybe I want more.

374
00:20:36.356 --> 00:20:37.757

[sniffles]

376
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:43.130
You all right?

377
00:20:44.031 --> 00:20:45.432
Fucking nerves, man.

378
00:20:46.733 --> 00:20:48.235
Just breathe through it.

379
00:20:50.203 --> 00:20:52.840
You got this.
You're fresh as ever.


380
00:21:03.951 --> 00:21:06.854
Habibi, this is a long way
to Frenchmen Street.


381
00:21:06.987 --> 00:21:09.156
Yeah, we like taking in
the sights, Ned.


382
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:11.258
[Ned] Okay. Your money.

383
00:21:11.391 --> 00:21:13.393
[coughing]

384
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.522
We're sure
walking the talk now.


385
00:21:42.655 --> 00:21:44.357
What, you want out?

386
00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:46.293
Shit, I'm going
back to the farm.


387
00:21:46.426 --> 00:21:48.695
You're the one who's got
everything to lose.


388
00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:50.697
[sighs]

389
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.665
Glad we huddled
up on that.


390
00:21:54.301 --> 00:21:57.837
Keep her running, Ned.
We may have to dine and dash.


391
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.608
[grunts]

392
00:22:02.675 --> 00:22:04.411
LeMarcus, Cathy Levy.
Nice to meet you.


393
00:22:04.544 --> 00:22:06.980
Yeah, nice to meet you.
This is Em.
Are you okay?


394
00:22:07.114 --> 00:22:10.217
Peachy, yeah. Just, uh,
ankle gets a little stiff
if I sit too long.


395
00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.818
Thanks for agreeing
to do this.


396
00:22:11.952 --> 00:22:14.021
Are you kidding?
Thanks for calling.


397
00:22:14.154 --> 00:22:16.856
[indistinct chattering]

398
00:22:18.525 --> 00:22:21.061
Whenever you're ready,
go ahead and take
a seat for me.


399
00:22:22.195 --> 00:22:23.363
Holy shit.

400
00:22:25.298 --> 00:22:27.167
Damn, you look good
ten stories high.


401
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.736
Just had to put that
in the background, huh?


402
00:22:32.973 --> 00:22:34.374
Here goes nothing.

403
00:22:34.507 --> 00:22:35.875
Go get 'em.

404
00:22:40.347 --> 00:22:41.949
Wait, wait.

[Cathy] You ready?


406
00:22:48.855 --> 00:22:50.490
We're recording.

407
00:23:00.667 --> 00:23:02.269
[coughs, clears throat]

408
00:23:03.636 --> 00:23:04.837
[sniffles]

409
00:23:04.972 --> 00:23:07.207
"I'm personally asking
all players


410
00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.076
in Monday's
national title game


411
00:23:09.209 --> 00:23:11.311
to join me in this protest

412
00:23:11.444 --> 00:23:13.046
and resulting boycott,

413
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.748
in order to demand that
the NCAA and its affiliates


414
00:23:15.882 --> 00:23:19.386
end their practice
of unpaid labor for the
majority of their workforce,


415
00:23:19.519 --> 00:23:24.224
a practice which results
in $18.9 billion a year
in total revenue


416
00:23:24.357 --> 00:23:26.126
for a system which,
in turn,


417
00:23:26.259 --> 00:23:29.596
only spends $3.6 billion
on athletic scholarships."


418
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.801
Where does the other 15-plus
billion dollars go, you ask?


419
00:23:34.934 --> 00:23:36.403
Well, I'll tell you:

420
00:23:36.536 --> 00:23:38.738
to an extremely lucrative
oligarchy.


421
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.741
"The president of the NCAA

422

received a salary
of $3.9 million last year.

The commissioners
of the top five
power conferences

of $4 million each year.

427
00:23:54.487 --> 00:23:57.991
is $7.3 billion
over the next 12 years."


428
00:23:58.125 --> 00:24:02.395
That's over $600 million
a year for three games.


429
00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:05.598
That's the reason
they're expanding
the play-offs to 12 games.

00:24:08.235 --> 00:24:09.336
[sighs]

431
00:24:11.738 --> 00:24:14.807
My coach, James Lazor,

432
00:24:14.941 --> 00:24:17.444
receives an annual salary
of $5 million,


433
00:24:17.577 --> 00:24:19.979
plus up to a million dollars
in on-the-field bonuses,


434
00:24:20.113 --> 00:24:22.349
including
the national title game.


435
00:24:22.482 --> 00:24:24.351
You see, all of this money

436
00:24:24.484 --> 00:24:27.687
is predicated on one
underlying principle:


437
00:24:28.688 --> 00:24:30.490
free labor.

438
00:24:30.623 --> 00:24:32.625
It is un-American,
it is exploitative,


439
00:24:32.759 --> 00:24:35.462
and it speaks
to the darkest spots
in the national soul.


440
00:24:35.595 --> 00:24:39.299
Now, it is not enough
for some of us to be able
to use our name and likeness,


441
00:24:39.432 --> 00:24:42.369
which, make no mistake,
costs them nothing.


442
00:24:42.502 --> 00:24:44.637
So our demands
are as follows:


443
00:24:46.106 --> 00:24:47.674
"One,

444
00:24:47.807 --> 00:24:50.009
the creation
of non-revocable,
player-controlled trusts


445
00:24:50.143 --> 00:24:52.279
for every Division I
varsity athlete.


446
00:24:52.412 --> 00:24:54.781
Number two,
the NCAA will form


447
00:24:54.914 --> 00:24:57.217
and contribute
to a player's
disability pension


448
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.885
for Division I athletes

449
00:24:59.018 --> 00:25:01.088
who are injured
from college athletics."


450
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:03.323
Shit.
"And number three,


451
00:25:03.456 --> 00:25:05.325
the NCAA will
officially recognize


452
00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:07.694
and collectively bargain
with the players' union,


453
00:25:07.827 --> 00:25:10.997
submitting to all
federally mandated laws
and guidelines


454
00:25:11.131 --> 00:25:13.266
of a unionized workforce."

455
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.270
In this, the NCAA
will recognize players


456
00:25:17.404 --> 00:25:20.707
as employees
and not student athletes.


457
00:25:22.142 --> 00:25:23.710
Thank you.

00:25:49.102 --> 00:25:50.403
Hey, there he is.

465
00:25:50.537 --> 00:25:52.405
All right.
Good morning, Coach.


466
00:25:52.539 --> 00:25:56.176
Thanks for coming over
so quick. This is
Wes Martin from the Big 12.


467
00:25:56.309 --> 00:25:58.478
He's gonna be our enemy for
the next 48 hours.
[chuckles]


468
00:25:58.611 --> 00:26:00.980
-Kevin McDonald from the CFP.
-We met yesterday.


469
00:26:01.114 --> 00:26:04.651
And Mike Titus, Senior VP,
Championships, D-I football.


470
00:26:04.784 --> 00:26:06.219
James, we've actually met.

471
00:26:06.353 --> 00:26:08.555
Yeah, at the Outback Bowl
two seasons ago.


472
00:26:08.688 --> 00:26:11.591
That's right.
You have come a long way.
Looks like you have too.


473
00:26:11.724 --> 00:26:14.427
[chuckles] Yes, indeed.
Please have a seat.


474
00:26:14.561 --> 00:26:16.329
Real, uh...

475
00:26:16.463 --> 00:26:19.299
Real mess we got here.
[Coach Lazor]
Well, not really.


476
00:26:19.432 --> 00:26:21.768
I just need to
get with LeMarcus
and talk things through.


477
00:26:21.901 --> 00:26:24.304
These kids don't
fully understand
what they're doing.


478
00:26:24.437 --> 00:26:26.706
A coach and his quarterback.
No closer bond.


479
00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:30.143
You were
a quarterback yourself
back in the day, am I right?


480
00:26:30.277 --> 00:26:32.445
Coaches are just players
who can't play anymore.


481
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.947
You still don't know
where he is?


482
00:26:35.081 --> 00:26:37.083
What?
[Kevin]
Where LeMarcus is.


483
00:26:37.217 --> 00:26:39.719
We're broadcasting this game
in 160 countries.


484
00:26:39.852 --> 00:26:42.322
They're all tuning in
to watch him go
against Cecil Burgess.


485
00:26:42.455 --> 00:26:45.124
I love these marketing guys.
You know that LeMarcus and Cecil


486
00:26:45.258 --> 00:26:47.960
both play offense,
so they won't be facing off.


487
00:26:48.094 --> 00:26:50.963
I know how
the game works, Coach.
Look, LeMarcus is around.


488
00:26:51.097 --> 00:26:52.732
He's probably
in the hotel somewhere.


489
00:26:52.865 --> 00:26:54.967
I just haven't had a chance
to get with him yet.


490
00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.873
Coach, I think it's best
if the NCAA took
the reins here.


491
00:27:01.007 --> 00:27:03.443
We're more of an impartial jury.
We just want a great game.


492
00:27:03.576 --> 00:27:06.379
Well, I think that's what
all of us want, right?
Yes, it is.


493
00:27:06.513 --> 00:27:10.250
That's why we were hoping
you could shed some light
on this young man.


494
00:27:10.383 --> 00:27:12.519
LeMarcus.
What's his character?


495
00:27:12.652 --> 00:27:14.421
He's a good kid.

496
00:27:14.554 --> 00:27:17.524
He's just, uh--
Like a lot of kids his age,


497
00:27:17.657 --> 00:27:20.460
maybe he's a little too fond
of the spotlight and its perks.


498
00:27:20.593 --> 00:27:23.363
Hell, if I was
the best QB in the country,
I think I'd be bouncin' 'em


499
00:27:23.496 --> 00:27:25.965
out of my apartment
three at a time, huh?


500
00:27:26.098 --> 00:27:28.935
[Coach Lazor] LeMarcus
is not a troublemaker, okay?


501
00:27:29.068 --> 00:27:33.005
I want to be
very clear on this.
LeMarcus is a good person.


502
00:27:34.073 --> 00:27:37.310
He's just a kid
with too much power


503
00:27:37.444 --> 00:27:40.012
who, I don't know,
had a bad tweet.


504
00:27:40.146 --> 00:27:42.615
-And interview.
-[person clears throat]
Okay.


505
00:27:42.749 --> 00:27:45.051
Well, you know,
Coach is gonna right
this ship.


506
00:27:45.184 --> 00:27:47.019
He just needs
a little more time, right?
[Coach Lazor] Yep.


507
00:27:47.153 --> 00:27:50.423
-[Kevin] You think
somebody got to him?
-"Somebody"?


508
00:27:50.557 --> 00:27:53.360
Like an organized labor rep,
an ACLU lawyer?


509
00:27:53.493 --> 00:27:55.027
Maybe the Russians.

510
00:27:56.829 --> 00:27:59.532
That's a fucking joke, guys.
Huh. Come on, guys.


511
00:27:59.666 --> 00:28:02.702
Look, LeMarcus, from sixth,
seventh grade on,


512
00:28:02.835 --> 00:28:04.604
they're big men on campus.

513
00:28:04.737 --> 00:28:07.407
He and Emmett,
they still think
this is playtime here.


514
00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.509
They don't understand
the world stage.


515
00:28:09.642 --> 00:28:11.678
They don't understand
the implications here.


516
00:28:11.811 --> 00:28:13.346
They just asked
to collectively bargain.


517
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.715
They want to destroy
the student-athlete
designation.


518
00:28:15.848 --> 00:28:18.385
Not the demands of some kids
spitting in the wind.


519
00:28:18.518 --> 00:28:19.919
You telling me I don't
know my own players?


520
00:28:20.052 --> 00:28:21.588
I'm saying
you might be in denial


521
00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:23.290
about what is actually
happening right now.


522
00:28:23.423 --> 00:28:25.124
Come on, Wes.
That's over the line.


523
00:28:25.258 --> 00:28:27.193
[Wes] Is it?
Yes, it is.


524
00:28:27.327 --> 00:28:30.096
Coach, what they're
asking for is bigger
than football or one game.


525
00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:31.664
Understood.
It's our entire
amateur athletics program


526
00:28:31.798 --> 00:28:33.333
in the country.

527
00:28:33.466 --> 00:28:37.270
That's 24 sports
for young men and women,
gone.


528
00:28:37.404 --> 00:28:39.806
Hundreds of thousands
of students,


529
00:28:39.939 --> 00:28:41.240
student athletes,

530
00:28:41.374 --> 00:28:43.943
being denied
a college experience.


531
00:28:44.076 --> 00:28:47.246
[Kevin]
We're 40-somethin' hours
to kickoff here, guys.


532
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.181
We need to make sure
everybody's suiting up.


533
00:28:49.316 --> 00:28:51.318
There hasn't been a single
defection from our side.


534
00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:53.320
It's theirs
that's falling apart.
[cell phone chimes]


535
00:28:53.453 --> 00:28:55.422
Hey. Nothing's
falling apart.


536
00:28:55.555 --> 00:28:57.524
Okay? Everybody relax
a little bit.


537
00:28:57.657 --> 00:29:00.293
-[Wes] Three wide receivers
just tweeted, "We're in."
-[men sighing]


538
00:29:00.427 --> 00:29:03.796
With a hashtag that's going
viral: "Fix the system."


539
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.467
Your other two stars,
Bishop and Cornelius,
could be next.


540
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.136
Orlando Bishop
is my one and only captain.


541
00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:12.939
He is team first.
He's not going anywhere.


542
00:29:13.072 --> 00:29:16.208
And Cornelius, frankly,
can't stand LeMarcus.


543
00:29:16.343 --> 00:29:18.745
He wouldn't follow him
into the Garden of Eden.
He'll play.


544
00:29:18.878 --> 00:29:22.982
One linebacker
ain't plugging this hole.
You're taking on water fast.


545
00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:25.452
Hey! He got blindsided
just like the rest of us,
all right?


546
00:29:25.585 --> 00:29:27.854
There's no reason
to keep attacking him.


547
00:29:27.987 --> 00:29:29.756
Here's an idea.

548
00:29:29.889 --> 00:29:32.992
Lean on the sophomores
and freshmen who have
something to lose.


549
00:29:33.125 --> 00:29:35.762
They won't want to risk
the eligibility over this.


550
00:29:36.663 --> 00:29:38.431
You'd love that,
wouldn't you, Wes?


551
00:29:38.565 --> 00:29:41.133
We all know I can't field
a competitive team


552
00:29:41.267 --> 00:29:44.003
with a bunch of 18-year-olds
that haven't played


553
00:29:44.136 --> 00:29:46.639
a meaningful snap
since high school.


554
00:29:46.773 --> 00:29:49.576
Fuck that. I'd rather not
field a team at all.


555
00:29:50.977 --> 00:29:53.279
I'm afraid
that's not an option.


556
00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:00.353
We wouldn't need any options
if I could get with
my quarterback


557
00:30:00.487 --> 00:30:03.523
instead of sitting around
this circle jerk.


558
00:30:05.725 --> 00:30:07.727
[clears throat]
Thanks for coming, Coach.


559
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.161
You bet.

560
00:30:10.296 --> 00:30:12.732
-Thanks for coming down.
-Don't lecture my guy.


561
00:30:12.865 --> 00:30:15.835
Thought you had your conference
under control, Everly.
We got nothin'.


562
00:30:15.968 --> 00:30:18.705
-[Everly] We got time.
-[Wes] Time is the one thing
we don't have.


563
00:30:18.838 --> 00:30:21.207
[Everly]
We got a little bit.
We'll be fine.


564
00:30:28.347 --> 00:30:29.882
All right.
The Death Star awaits.


565
00:30:30.016 --> 00:30:32.018
The Cougars are staying
on the 17th floor.


566
00:30:32.151 --> 00:30:33.653
There's a stairway
around the back.


567
00:30:33.786 --> 00:30:35.455
Let's go get this done
and get out of here.


568
00:30:35.588 --> 00:30:37.524
Keep it running, Ned.
We'll be back in 20.


569
00:30:37.657 --> 00:30:39.692
[hip-hop music playing]
[person] Eat, nigga, eat!


570
00:30:39.826 --> 00:30:41.861
[knock on door]
I'm nice. I'm nice.


571
00:30:41.994 --> 00:30:45.498
Watch this bucket
right here. Bucket!
[pounding on door]


572
00:30:45.632 --> 00:30:46.666
Hold on.

573
00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:48.501
Hey, don't fuckin' cheat.

574
00:30:50.603 --> 00:30:52.672
Hello, Roc.
Emmett Sunday, esquire.


575
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.542
You may know me
from such hits


576
00:30:55.675 --> 00:30:57.410
as Last Stand
at the Texas Stadium,


577
00:30:57.544 --> 00:30:59.345
Destruction
at the Peach Bowl...
That's not funny.


578
00:30:59.479 --> 00:31:01.814
I'm number 82.
Yeah, the tight end.
What the fuck do you want?


579
00:31:01.948 --> 00:31:04.050
The one and only.
Mind if I come in
for a sec? Thanks.


580
00:31:04.183 --> 00:31:05.985
Hold on. You just gonna
walk in my room like that?


581
00:31:06.118 --> 00:31:08.020
Cecil, what's going on, man?
Emmett Sunday. How you doing?


582
00:31:08.154 --> 00:31:10.790
Just gonna turn on--
Why you turning
on my light like that?


583
00:31:10.923 --> 00:31:13.893
-I'm just gonna
turn off this TV.
-Yo, white boy. [sighs]


584
00:31:14.026 --> 00:31:17.363
Chill out and let me know
why the fuck you in my room
before I fight you.


585
00:31:17.497 --> 00:31:19.666
Cecil, you mind
if I show you something
for a second?


586
00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:21.701
-It may help make my case.
-All right, man, go ahead.


587
00:31:21.834 --> 00:31:23.770
He's been replying
real quick. Hold on.


588
00:31:23.903 --> 00:31:26.072
Yeah, there you go.
Hold on.


589
00:31:26.205 --> 00:31:28.107
Nah, nah, nah.
This way first.


590
00:31:30.042 --> 00:31:32.745
Get the fuck out of here.
I ain't fucking with you.


591
00:31:32.879 --> 00:31:34.947
Yo, this is LeBron, nigga.
Look.
That's LeBron.


592
00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:36.916
LeBron DM'd these fucks.
That's the king.


593
00:31:37.049 --> 00:31:38.951
Oh, shit! He just said
"What's up?" to you.


594
00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:40.553
Yeah, 'cause
he knows you're here.


595
00:31:40.687 --> 00:31:42.755
How the fuck you get
LeBron to DM you?


596
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:44.624
We're buddies, man.
And I was thinking,


597
00:31:44.757 --> 00:31:46.726
Clutch just started
a new football division
to rep,


598
00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:50.196
and I was thinking, hell,
maybe I just put in
a good word for you two.


599
00:31:50.329 --> 00:31:53.900
Fly over to LA,
the land of big lips,
fake tits, and sunshine.


600
00:31:54.033 --> 00:31:55.802
I love fake titties.
I know. Me too.


601
00:31:55.935 --> 00:31:58.237
And you sit down
with LeBron and Maverick
and have a conversation.


602
00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.974
Grab lunch with LeBron in LA?
You know I love tacos, nigga.
Hold on. How we do that?


603
00:32:02.108 --> 00:32:04.376
It's a little weird.
I need your phones.


604
00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:06.412
-My phone?
-I just need your phone.


605
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.083
Fuck it.
Hey, it's LeBron. Here.


606
00:32:11.217 --> 00:32:13.285
Come on,
give him your phone.
Come on, Cecil.


607
00:32:13.419 --> 00:32:15.822
I ain't gonna do
anything weird with it.
Come on.


608
00:32:15.955 --> 00:32:17.490
You can keep my phone
as collateral.


609
00:32:17.624 --> 00:32:20.159
Collateral and shit.
I'ma pocket this bitch.


610
00:32:20.292 --> 00:32:21.327
Don't move.

611
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.930
Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:32:24.063 --> 00:32:26.298
Bruh, LeBron.
LeBron, though.
[Emmett whistles]


613
00:32:26.432 --> 00:32:28.034
What's happening, fellas?

614
00:32:29.001 --> 00:32:31.671
Surprise, surprise.
Shit.


615
00:32:31.804 --> 00:32:34.974
-Not LeBron.
-So, what's up?
I know y'all seen it.


616
00:32:35.107 --> 00:32:37.309
Yeah, we seen it.
[LeMarcus]
What y'all think?


617
00:32:37.443 --> 00:32:39.345
Hoping y'all gonna join us.

618
00:32:40.479 --> 00:32:42.081
And skip out
on the title game?


619
00:32:42.214 --> 00:32:43.482
Man, you out
your fucking mind.


620
00:32:43.616 --> 00:32:45.552
[Roc] For real.
[LeMarcus] Yeah, probably.


621
00:32:45.685 --> 00:32:47.787
It's gonna take
a little crazy to get
it done though, ain't it?


622
00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.690
Yeah, but he's Kiper's
number one back.


623
00:32:50.823 --> 00:32:52.625
Going eighth to Baltimore
at the latest.


624
00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:54.827
He ain't risking that
fucking with y'all.


625
00:32:54.961 --> 00:32:56.929
Hmm. Buffalo should
take him at three.


626
00:32:57.063 --> 00:32:59.899
-They're going tackle.
-Maybe Miami gets smart
and takes you at one.


627
00:33:00.032 --> 00:33:03.235
-Then where you gonna go?
-Me? Shit.
CFL after this, probably.


628
00:33:03.369 --> 00:33:04.971
-[snorts]
-[LeMarcus chuckles]


629
00:33:05.104 --> 00:33:06.873
Yeah, Saskatchewan
or some shit like that.


630
00:33:07.006 --> 00:33:09.776
[Roc] Saskatchewan?
Listen.


631
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:12.812
They're still gonna find
a way to play this game
without me and Emmett.


632
00:33:14.013 --> 00:33:15.648
We gonna need you.

633
00:33:15.782 --> 00:33:17.984
The Haitian Hammer,
running wild on all those
TV promos.


634
00:33:18.117 --> 00:33:20.920
Come watch him put up

635
00:33:21.053 --> 00:33:22.655
Yeah, maybe then he goes
number one.


636
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:24.891
But if he sits, they gonna
Kaepernick him like you.


637
00:33:25.024 --> 00:33:27.560
Hmm.
Come on, bruh. You might
fall out the first round.


638
00:33:27.694 --> 00:33:29.996
Do y'all even know
what the rookie minimum
is down there?


639
00:33:30.129 --> 00:33:33.499
Probably not, but they
taking backs in the third
or fourth round nowadays.


640
00:33:33.633 --> 00:33:35.067
Four years and done,
we're back in the hood.


641
00:33:35.201 --> 00:33:37.970
That is why we gotta stick
together on this, fellas.


642
00:33:38.104 --> 00:33:40.006
Think about it.

643
00:33:40.139 --> 00:33:41.674
If we all sit,
what are they gonna do?


644
00:33:41.808 --> 00:33:44.911
Hmm? It's called
collective action.


645
00:33:45.044 --> 00:33:47.179
Fuck you learn
a big word like that?


646
00:33:48.247 --> 00:33:49.682
Intro to Organized Labor.

647
00:33:49.816 --> 00:33:52.885
[scoffs] A class?
He talking 'bout a class.


648
00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:56.422
[chuckles] Only class
you probably took was Intro
to Organized Dick-sucking.


649
00:33:56.555 --> 00:33:59.058
-Flap your gums
'cause you're scared.
-Scared of what? You?


650
00:33:59.191 --> 00:34:01.027
Scared you're gonna be
teaching high-school PE
next year.


651
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.461
I know this is my last game,
same as you.


652
00:34:02.595 --> 00:34:04.530
Fuck you.
I'm playing in the League.


653
00:34:04.664 --> 00:34:07.099
[LeMarcus] Hey, look,
we ain't come here
for all that, all right?


654
00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:09.535
Look, me and E are serious
about this.


655
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.706
We just came here
to let y'all know.


656
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.408
Sleep on it. Pray on it.

657
00:34:16.542 --> 00:34:18.945
-Look, I appreciate y'all.
-Yeah. All right, yeah.


658
00:34:19.078 --> 00:34:20.980
All right.

659
00:34:21.113 --> 00:34:24.250
No hard feelings.
Yeah, no hard feelings.


660
00:34:24.383 --> 00:34:26.418
Collective action.

661
00:34:26.552 --> 00:34:30.222
Man, I hope we get
to play those guys.
Go ahead, Ned.


662
00:34:30.356 --> 00:34:33.059
If we don't get Cecil
on board, we're gonna
need the whole squad,


663
00:34:33.192 --> 00:34:34.560
or we ain't
playing shit.


664
00:34:34.694 --> 00:34:36.929
We get the younger guys,
Orlando will come too.


665
00:34:38.364 --> 00:34:40.199
Hey, get
Bob Reynolds a note.


666
00:34:40.332 --> 00:34:42.568
Tell him we'll give him
the exclusive.


667
00:34:42.702 --> 00:34:44.103
Copy that.

668
00:34:49.241 --> 00:34:51.577
Wonder how many of these
we've gone through already.


669
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:54.346
[siren whoops]
[crowd cheering]


670
00:34:58.918 --> 00:35:00.619
We don't want
nobody to know.


671
00:35:00.753 --> 00:35:02.288
The press or anybody.
We don't even know
that he sits.


672
00:35:02.421 --> 00:35:04.223
Okay? Make sure
you keep them out.


673
00:35:04.356 --> 00:35:06.058
[crowd continues cheering]

674
00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:34.653
We all present
and accounted for, Scotty?
Yes, sir.


675
00:35:36.422 --> 00:35:38.925
LeMarcus James,
for those of you
who are not familiar,


676
00:35:39.058 --> 00:35:40.693
won the Heisman Trophy
this year.


677
00:35:40.827 --> 00:35:43.095
Most famous player
in college football.


678
00:35:43.229 --> 00:35:45.264
Picture's 130 feet tall
across the street,


679
00:35:45.397 --> 00:35:47.834
and now you're telling me,
what, he's the fucking
Invisible Man?


680
00:35:47.967 --> 00:35:50.036
[Scotty] We're working
with hotel security, Coach.


681
00:35:50.169 --> 00:35:52.739
They went out a fire exit
without a camera.
That's how we lost 'em.


682
00:35:52.872 --> 00:35:55.674
Well, the media found him,
didn't they?


683
00:35:55.808 --> 00:35:57.977
I don't know.
Maybe I should ask
LeBron James for help


684
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.179
instead of you
simple snowflakes,


685
00:36:00.312 --> 00:36:03.382
who I feed, clothe
and pay six figures a year.


686
00:36:03.515 --> 00:36:05.384
Or get a free
top-tier education.


687
00:36:05.517 --> 00:36:07.653
This is a fucking
manhunt.


688
00:36:07.787 --> 00:36:10.156
Find me LeMarcus James
and Emmett Sunday,


689
00:36:10.289 --> 00:36:12.458
or I swear to God,

690
00:36:12.591 --> 00:36:15.895
the next coaching job
any of you get within
shitting distance of


691
00:36:16.028 --> 00:36:19.832
is gonna be JV
at the fucking
Little Sisters of the Poor.


692
00:36:21.267 --> 00:36:23.903
Go! Get out there!
Go fucking find him, now!


693
00:36:24.036 --> 00:36:26.172
We'll find him, Coach.
Goddamn it.


694
00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:31.410
[softly] Goddamn.

695
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.282
Come on, fellas.
Eat up.


696
00:36:37.016 --> 00:36:38.550
[LeMarcus scoffs]

697
00:36:38.684 --> 00:36:41.520
Y'all can hate me
all you want.


698
00:36:41.653 --> 00:36:43.990
I ain't the one
y'all should be hatin'.


699
00:36:44.123 --> 00:36:47.193
Ain't me cashing out
on millions of dollars
a year


700
00:36:47.326 --> 00:36:50.196
while y'all can't pay rent,
can't put gas in y'all whips.


701
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:52.364
If you even have a whip.
[scoffs]


702
00:36:52.498 --> 00:36:54.566
For 55 years,

703
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:57.937
guys like you ate, drank,
fucked and played ball.


704
00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.206
We're just happy with
a free education, right?


705
00:37:00.339 --> 00:37:02.608
Nice free suit?
That shit'll keep us
happy, right?


706
00:37:02.741 --> 00:37:04.911
They know how to get us.
But not no more, okay?


707
00:37:05.044 --> 00:37:07.246
This shit is capitalism
at its finest.


708
00:37:07.379 --> 00:37:08.948
Greed at its worst.

709
00:37:09.081 --> 00:37:12.284
Everybody around us
got private jets
and private chefs,


710
00:37:12.418 --> 00:37:15.021
and we can't even
accept a fucking
free meal as a gift.


711
00:37:15.154 --> 00:37:17.256
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
That pizza slice
right there,


712
00:37:17.389 --> 00:37:19.091
double fistin'
with them shits,


713
00:37:19.225 --> 00:37:21.593
that kid kicked out
of college twice. Shit.


714
00:37:21.727 --> 00:37:24.964
And we out there
every single day.
Blood, sweat and tears.


715
00:37:25.097 --> 00:37:26.565
You remember
your ankle, bro? Hmm?


716
00:37:26.698 --> 00:37:28.467
Remember when it swole up
like a watermelon?


717
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.270
They shot you up,
and they made you play,
didn't they? Huh?


718
00:37:31.403 --> 00:37:33.672
Think about how that shit
gonna make you feel
in 30 years.


719
00:37:33.806 --> 00:37:35.842
You ain't got no medical.
You got insurance?


720
00:37:35.975 --> 00:37:38.344
What you gonna fix
your broken body with, huh?
Duct tape?


721
00:37:38.477 --> 00:37:40.479
Gorilla Glue the shits
back together?
What we gonna do?


722
00:37:40.612 --> 00:37:42.281
That's how y'all got to be
thinking about this.


723
00:37:42.414 --> 00:37:43.950
Where do we want to be
in 30 years from now?


724
00:37:44.083 --> 00:37:46.718
It starts right now.
It starts right here.


725
00:37:51.257 --> 00:37:52.624
Who bought
all this Pizza Hut?


726
00:37:56.762 --> 00:37:58.697
[LeMarcus] Look,
I'll be the first to say it.


727
00:37:58.831 --> 00:38:01.267
Lazor's taught me a lot
about more than just football.


728
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.170
But what I began to realize
is I was being brainwashed,


729
00:38:04.303 --> 00:38:06.172
just like all of y'all.

730
00:38:06.305 --> 00:38:09.141
Scared of speaking up
because it was easy
to go along to get along.


731
00:38:09.275 --> 00:38:11.343
Don't let them tell you
there ain't enough
to go around.


732
00:38:11.477 --> 00:38:14.013
They got so much money,
they don't even know
where to put the shits.


733
00:38:14.146 --> 00:38:15.614
Y'all okay with that?

734
00:38:15.747 --> 00:38:17.749
All right.
You okay with that?


735
00:38:17.884 --> 00:38:20.819
[person] Guys, don't think
this isn't a two-way street.


736
00:38:20.953 --> 00:38:22.855
Where do you green fucks

737
00:38:22.989 --> 00:38:26.792
think you're transferring to
if I bury your ass
on the pine?


738
00:38:26.926 --> 00:38:29.461
I own your future.

739
00:38:29.595 --> 00:38:33.132
Where the hell
is LeMarcus?


740
00:38:33.265 --> 00:38:35.201
Let's be real.

741
00:38:35.334 --> 00:38:37.669
There are 12,500
draft-eligible players


742
00:38:37.803 --> 00:38:40.072
for the NFL
every single year,


743
00:38:40.206 --> 00:38:42.108
and only 300 of us
get drafted.


744
00:38:42.241 --> 00:38:44.510
That means
over 12,000 of us


745
00:38:44.643 --> 00:38:46.879
participate
in a multi-billion-
dollar industry


746
00:38:47.013 --> 00:38:48.514
that won't even give us
health insurance.


747
00:38:48.647 --> 00:38:51.150
And yet, they selling us
the pearly gates?


748
00:38:51.283 --> 00:38:53.152
Zed,
you got a resume?


749
00:38:53.285 --> 00:38:55.287
Internship? Why not?

750
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:57.589
'Cause you been playing
D-I football for the last
three years, right?


751
00:38:57.723 --> 00:38:59.425
That's right.
And they make you work it


752
00:38:59.558 --> 00:39:02.161
like it's a full-time job,
don't they? That's right.


753
00:39:02.294 --> 00:39:05.064
What about all those bullshit
classes they make you take
to stay on the field, huh?


754
00:39:05.197 --> 00:39:07.366
Hey, you remember
the Swahili shit
y'all was taking?


755
00:39:07.499 --> 00:39:10.569
Swahili? How do you say,
"Do you want fries with that?"
in Swahili?


756
00:39:10.702 --> 00:39:13.739
Guess what, fellas.
When y'all get out there
in the real world,


757
00:39:13.872 --> 00:39:15.707
out there in the jungle,

758
00:39:15.841 --> 00:39:17.509
it ain't no fun
when you broke as a joke.


759
00:39:17.643 --> 00:39:20.179
Tell us where he's at.
I'm taking it back.


760
00:39:20.312 --> 00:39:23.215
He at the W,
stayin' under a fake name.


761
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:25.051
Okay.

762
00:39:25.184 --> 00:39:26.852
Barack Gambino.

763
00:39:26.986 --> 00:39:29.621
Barack Gambino, man?
Seriously?


764
00:39:29.755 --> 00:39:31.057
Bank it.

765
00:39:32.925 --> 00:39:35.594
And even if it means
the death of me,
y'all can say,


766
00:39:35.727 --> 00:39:39.765
"I got caught up
with that crazy motherfucker
and his dreams of glory.


767
00:39:39.898 --> 00:39:41.900
And if I can do it,
then we can do it,


768
00:39:42.034 --> 00:39:44.903
and we could set ourselves up
and future generations
to come.


769
00:39:45.037 --> 00:39:46.838
Tell 'em about the barn, LJ.

770
00:39:46.973 --> 00:39:49.441
'Cause there
is a barn in Galilee
with grain filled so high


771
00:39:49.575 --> 00:39:51.077
that they won't even
sell it all.


772
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.679
And you know what God says?
He says, "You poor fools.


773
00:39:53.812 --> 00:39:56.882
You may think that you're rich,
but you are poor
in the eyes of God."


774
00:39:57.016 --> 00:40:00.486
Why? Because
my people are hungry,
and your barn is full.


775
00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:03.255
-Make it plain!
-There is a barn in Galilee


776
00:40:03.389 --> 00:40:05.724
filled with grain,
and we out here starving.


777
00:40:05.857 --> 00:40:07.593
God is with us.

778
00:40:07.726 --> 00:40:11.097
He says
there is nothing to lose.
There is nothing to fear.


779
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.067
I am here, and there is
nothing to fear!

I mean it.

790
00:40:58.044 --> 00:40:59.511
Start a new chapter.

791
00:41:02.948 --> 00:41:05.151
You really
want me there?


792
00:41:06.918 --> 00:41:07.986
I do.

Hey, what's your hurry?

811
00:42:06.212 --> 00:42:08.680
Rodger.
Brett.


812
00:42:08.814 --> 00:42:11.683
I've been head of
the booster club since '98.


813
00:42:11.817 --> 00:42:14.586
You ever seen
a national title game


814
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.955
in your own luxury box,
Brett?


815
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:18.457
No.

816
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.561
Lobster, filet mignon,
blow.


817
00:42:22.694 --> 00:42:24.863
Whatever
your heart desires.


818
00:42:24.996 --> 00:42:26.265
It sounds awesome.

819
00:42:26.398 --> 00:42:30.035
You wanna come with?
I can get you a ticket.


820
00:42:30.169 --> 00:42:32.238
Are they even gonna play?

821
00:42:32.371 --> 00:42:36.575
Oh, they'll play.
Don't you worry your pretty
little head about that.


822
00:42:36.708 --> 00:42:40.479
Gonna find me
my quarterback,
and it'll be Easy Street.


823
00:42:42.781 --> 00:42:44.550
Five hundred dollars.

824
00:42:44.683 --> 00:42:46.618
And what does that
get me, Brett?


825
00:42:46.752 --> 00:42:48.754
A room number.

826
00:42:48.887 --> 00:42:50.656
What time
do you get off?


827
00:42:50.789 --> 00:42:52.791
[chuckles] Not mine.

It's Rodger and Taylor.
Open up.

to get another room again.

[Rodgers] Hey!

835
00:43:10.409 --> 00:43:12.911
Just go get it
before they wake up
the whole hotel, man.

[knocking continues]

837
00:43:16.047 --> 00:43:17.449
Shut up and get inside.

838
00:43:17.583 --> 00:43:19.785
Easy, big fella.
We come in peace.


839
00:43:22.053 --> 00:43:23.455
How the hell
did you find us?


840
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:25.724
-A happy accident.
-What do you want?


841
00:43:25.857 --> 00:43:27.326
[Rodgers] Just to talk,
that's it.


842
00:43:27.459 --> 00:43:29.261
One minute,
and then we're gone.


843
00:43:29.395 --> 00:43:32.564
Hey, you look like hell.
You okay?


844
00:43:32.698 --> 00:43:34.300
We're owed.

845
00:43:35.867 --> 00:43:37.769
You are owed?

846
00:43:37.903 --> 00:43:40.105
Yes. We're owed.

847
00:43:40.239 --> 00:43:44.042
Taylor.
What I think my associate
is trying to communicate here


848
00:43:44.176 --> 00:43:45.511
is that we're hurtin'.

849
00:43:45.644 --> 00:43:48.680
We feel like
we're invested here,


850
00:43:48.814 --> 00:43:51.383
especially after all
we've been through together.


851
00:43:51.517 --> 00:43:54.186
Because you loaned me a car?

852
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.121
And helped refinance
your mother's mortgage


853
00:43:56.255 --> 00:43:58.490
when she fell behind,
and also with your brother.


854
00:43:58.624 --> 00:44:02.261
-Should we talk
about the message--
-Don't... say another word.


855
00:44:04.763 --> 00:44:06.332
And don't do this.

856
00:44:06.465 --> 00:44:08.334
You don't give a shit
about us.


857
00:44:08.467 --> 00:44:11.837
-All you give a shit about
is your damn game.
-Now, now, now, Taylor.


858
00:44:14.306 --> 00:44:16.842
LeMarcus, what--
what's going on here?


859
00:44:16.975 --> 00:44:18.710
Me and you are buddies.

860
00:44:18.844 --> 00:44:20.712
You love playing football.

861
00:44:20.846 --> 00:44:22.881
Hell, I love watching you
play football.


862
00:44:23.014 --> 00:44:26.184
An entire college campus,

863
00:44:26.318 --> 00:44:28.454
thinks that you're
Jesus Christ incarnate.


864
00:44:28.587 --> 00:44:31.690
What's going on?
You need money?


865
00:44:32.691 --> 00:44:34.726
Just tell me
where to send the check.


866
00:44:36.262 --> 00:44:38.029
What the fuck
don't you get?


867
00:44:41.967 --> 00:44:43.402
You ever read The Jungle?

868
00:44:43.535 --> 00:44:45.604
What has that got to do
with anything, LeMarcus?


869
00:44:45.737 --> 00:44:47.339
The American Dream.

870
00:44:48.907 --> 00:44:51.243
This guy Jurgis
from Lithuania,


871
00:44:51.377 --> 00:44:53.612
he worked
at the meat-packing plant
in Chicago.


872
00:44:53.745 --> 00:44:55.647
Now, Jurgis was young,

873
00:44:55.781 --> 00:44:57.683
he was bigger, stronger
than the rest of 'em.


874
00:44:57.816 --> 00:44:59.718
So they put him
to work in the kill beds.


875
00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:02.354
He worked so hard,
he couldn't bend
his fingers.


876
00:45:02.488 --> 00:45:05.591
He couldn't flex his knees,
broke his ankle.


877
00:45:05.724 --> 00:45:08.193
After all those years,
he just kept on working,


878
00:45:08.327 --> 00:45:10.529
and he loved it.

879
00:45:10.662 --> 00:45:14.400
See, that didn't mean shit
to the guys who owned
the plant though, did it?


880
00:45:14.533 --> 00:45:18.003
'Cause they weren't
about to take care
of no broke immigrant.


881
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:22.574
LeMarcus... [sighs]
You ain't that guy.


882
00:45:22.708 --> 00:45:25.444
You're about to be
the number one pick


883
00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:27.779
in the first round
of the NFL draft,


884
00:45:27.913 --> 00:45:31.350
-and Miami is gonna
pay you $35 million...
-Yeah, I know.


885
00:45:31.483 --> 00:45:33.218
That's a whole lot of meat.

886
00:45:33.352 --> 00:45:36.388
What about the guys
who ain't going
into the League?


887
00:45:36.522 --> 00:45:39.257
The guys who busted
their head in the dirt
for the last four years,


888
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:41.793
only to wind up
mangled and broke?
What about them, huh?


889
00:45:41.927 --> 00:45:45.130
-So this whole thing's
about you?
-It's about everyone, man.


890
00:45:45.263 --> 00:45:47.466
What the fuck do you think
you're gonna do?


891
00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:50.068
You can't square off
with the entire system.


892
00:45:50.201 --> 00:45:52.938
You two cannot
unionize college sports,
and that's a fact.


893
00:45:54.373 --> 00:45:56.308
-It ain't two.
-What?


894
00:45:56.442 --> 00:45:58.744
It ain't just two of us
no more,


895
00:45:58.877 --> 00:46:00.278
and that's a fact.

896
00:46:03.715 --> 00:46:05.083
[sighs]

897
00:46:10.756 --> 00:46:13.091
[person] We have to
dismantle the structure


898
00:46:13.224 --> 00:46:14.793
and do something
that's more equitable,


899
00:46:14.926 --> 00:46:16.495
that's fairer
for these athletes.


900
00:46:16.628 --> 00:46:18.330
I've got teammates
that I played


901
00:46:18.464 --> 00:46:20.432
collegiate ball with
at Ohio State


902
00:46:20.566 --> 00:46:22.267
that suffered some
career-ending injuries,


903
00:46:22.401 --> 00:46:24.503
some life-altering
injuries,


904
00:46:24.636 --> 00:46:26.838
that struggle
and still struggle today


905
00:46:26.972 --> 00:46:29.608
without any support
from the university.


906
00:46:29.741 --> 00:46:31.309
It's very frustrating.

907
00:46:31.443 --> 00:46:33.178
So I'm proud
to stand behind


908
00:46:33.311 --> 00:46:35.313
LeMarcus James
and what he's doing.


909
00:46:35.447 --> 00:46:38.083
Wilson, what do you think
of the situation
with LeMarcus James?


910
00:46:38.216 --> 00:46:40.519
Listen, Greeny,
I'm really impressed
by LeMarcus James.


911
00:46:40.652 --> 00:46:42.821
This guy's given up
possibly $35 million,


912
00:46:42.954 --> 00:46:44.690
maybe the first pick
overall.


913
00:46:44.823 --> 00:46:46.958
The reality is,
he's got so much to lose


914
00:46:47.092 --> 00:46:48.794
but really so much to gain.

915
00:46:48.927 --> 00:46:51.229
And I think that you and I
both know, Greeny,


916
00:46:51.363 --> 00:46:53.632
that this whole system's broke,
and we got to fix it.


917
00:46:53.765 --> 00:46:55.801
It's got to get fixed
immediately.


918
00:46:55.934 --> 00:46:58.504
[Greenberg] There you have it.
Directly from one of
the great quarterbacks


919
00:46:58.637 --> 00:47:00.939
in the history of the NFL,
Russell Wilson.


920
00:47:01.072 --> 00:47:03.875
He won the Walter Payton
Man of the Year award
in 2020.


921
00:47:04.009 --> 00:47:06.277
Russell, thank you.
Always a pleasure, Greeny.
I'll see you soon.


922
00:47:06.412 --> 00:47:09.648
[Greenberg] In the meantime,
we've got other news
to talk about...


923
00:47:11.082 --> 00:47:12.718
I understand.

924
00:47:15.487 --> 00:47:17.556
Yeah, we all know
what's at stake here.


925
00:47:19.057 --> 00:47:21.393
I will get
him into this game.


926
00:47:21.527 --> 00:47:23.895
You have
my personal guarantee.


927
00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:25.363
Of course.

928
00:47:25.497 --> 00:47:27.365
Well, thank you--
Yeah, he hung up on me.


929
00:47:27.499 --> 00:47:30.402
[sighs, panting]

930
00:47:30.536 --> 00:47:32.871
You're up early.
What, do you sleep
in that power suit?


931
00:47:33.004 --> 00:47:34.873
I might as well
at this point, right?


932
00:47:35.974 --> 00:47:38.009
Pressure
from the overlords?


933
00:47:38.143 --> 00:47:40.812
I'd say my very early
retirement is being discussed


934
00:47:40.946 --> 00:47:43.181
unless I change the optics,
and quick.


935
00:47:43.314 --> 00:47:45.751
And if I go,
so goes your retainer.


936
00:47:45.884 --> 00:47:48.554
[laughs] We can't let
that happen, now, can we?


937
00:47:50.522 --> 00:47:52.023
We offer talks.

938
00:47:53.091 --> 00:47:54.526
We hear their demands.

939
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.262
We promise a committee
to explore.
No.


940
00:48:01.266 --> 00:48:03.569
They've got 40 players now.

941
00:48:03.702 --> 00:48:06.705
[Mike] I heard.
They think
they can win this.


942
00:48:06.838 --> 00:48:09.741
If we offer talks,
then they will never leave
the table empty-handed.


943
00:48:09.875 --> 00:48:12.043
They're kids.
Exactly.


944
00:48:12.177 --> 00:48:15.113
They haven't lost enough
to believe that that's
the most likely outcome.


945
00:48:15.246 --> 00:48:19.084
They don't understand
that life is about losing.


946
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:21.920
I pay you for options.
What are they?


947
00:48:22.053 --> 00:48:23.889
Well, I can only see two.

948
00:48:24.022 --> 00:48:25.957
You either give them
what they want...


949
00:48:26.091 --> 00:48:27.893
Second option?

950
00:48:28.026 --> 00:48:30.395
We savage them.

951
00:48:33.198 --> 00:48:36.568
You find everything--
every grain, every person.


952
00:48:36.702 --> 00:48:41.106
You turn LeMarcus James
into a monster
that no one could follow.


953
00:48:42.741 --> 00:48:44.943
LeMarcus decided
to do this.


954
00:48:45.076 --> 00:48:47.479
He waded into your waters.

955
00:48:47.613 --> 00:48:49.848
We have to react.

956
00:48:52.217 --> 00:48:55.521
Unfortunately,
I don't have the luxury
to react, Ms. Poe.


957
00:48:58.557 --> 00:49:00.025
But you do.

958
00:49:08.033 --> 00:49:09.968
[LeMarcus coughing]

959
00:49:11.436 --> 00:49:12.938
It's started.

960
00:49:14.139 --> 00:49:15.574
What?

961
00:49:15.707 --> 00:49:17.576
They got their hounds loose.

962
00:49:19.978 --> 00:49:21.379
[LeMarcus sighs]

963
00:49:21.513 --> 00:49:23.849
And you know
they're gonna dig up more.


964
00:49:23.982 --> 00:49:25.617
[crowd cheering]

965
00:49:25.751 --> 00:49:28.319
[chanting]
LJ! LJ! LJ! LJ! LJ!


966
00:49:28.453 --> 00:49:30.155
[whooping, cheering]

967
00:49:33.191 --> 00:49:35.326
[Emmett] We're gonna
have to move again.


968
00:49:37.228 --> 00:49:38.363
No more running.

969
00:49:40.431 --> 00:49:41.800
Let 'em come.

970
00:49:43.669 --> 00:49:46.104
Luke?
Yes, every player.


971
00:49:46.237 --> 00:49:47.806
I don't care. Luke!

972
00:49:47.939 --> 00:49:50.976
On the goddamn roof,
for all I care.
Thirty minutes.


973
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:53.745
Bailey,
have you seen Luke?


974
00:49:53.879 --> 00:49:55.847
I got nine players

975
00:49:55.981 --> 00:49:59.017
and the cabal
of fucking idiocy around me.


976
00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:01.753
I sent him to the store
for McConnell's ice cream.


977
00:50:01.887 --> 00:50:04.022
Baby, you can't
be doing that now.


978
00:50:04.155 --> 00:50:06.592
This is fucking serious!
LeMarcus...


979
00:50:06.725 --> 00:50:08.493
Goddamn it!
You know what hurts the most?


980
00:50:08.627 --> 00:50:11.129
He never came to me
with any of this,


981
00:50:11.262 --> 00:50:13.464
after everything
we've been through together.


982
00:50:20.806 --> 00:50:22.207
Are you...

983
00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.711
Jesus fucking Christ.
Are you fucking kidding me?


984
00:50:26.544 --> 00:50:27.846
Now?

985
00:50:27.979 --> 00:50:30.115
I got a full-on rebellion
in my locker room,


986
00:50:30.248 --> 00:50:33.351
I got the head of the NCAA
and both conferences
up my ass


987
00:50:33.484 --> 00:50:36.454
at the national fucking
title game...


988
00:50:36.588 --> 00:50:39.658
Now? You're gonna...
Coach, we talked
about this.


989
00:50:39.791 --> 00:50:43.695
How can I say this again
in a way that you can get it?


990
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:46.031
I need to find myself again.

991
00:50:46.164 --> 00:50:48.700
I need some me time.
Not you time. Me time.


992
00:50:48.834 --> 00:50:51.069
Goddamn, you
fuckin' selfish...


993
00:50:51.202 --> 00:50:54.372
Wow! Finish it.
Finish it.


994
00:50:54.505 --> 00:50:56.708
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

995
00:50:56.842 --> 00:50:58.143
I'm sorry.
[scoffs]


996
00:50:58.276 --> 00:50:59.778
I know the sacrifices
you've made for me.


997
00:50:59.911 --> 00:51:02.914
Of course I do.
But please...


998
00:51:12.724 --> 00:51:15.060
Okay, which place do you
want me to stay away from?


999
00:51:15.193 --> 00:51:17.195
Where are you going?
The beach house?


1000
00:51:18.563 --> 00:51:19.931
I'm going to Rome.

1001
00:51:20.065 --> 00:51:21.432
Rome?

1002
00:51:23.168 --> 00:51:25.203
Okay, I can stay away
from Rome.


1003
00:51:33.812 --> 00:51:35.981
You're not going
to Rome alone, are you?


1004
00:51:36.748 --> 00:51:37.749
Question:

1005
00:51:37.883 --> 00:51:39.918
If I hadn't stayed here

1006
00:51:40.051 --> 00:51:41.887
to explain to you
that I was leaving,


1007
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.722
would you have noticed
I'd gone?


1008
00:51:43.855 --> 00:51:45.657
I know. I get it. I get it.
All I wanna know--


1009
00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:48.760
Look.
It's this fucking job.


1010
00:51:48.894 --> 00:51:50.295
Oh, God.

1011
00:51:50.428 --> 00:51:53.598
I swear to God,
I will make it up to you.


1012
00:51:53.732 --> 00:51:55.801
Okay? Please.

1013
00:51:55.934 --> 00:51:58.436
I swear to God,
I'm gonna make this up to you.


1014
00:51:58.569 --> 00:51:59.705
It's just...
James...


1015
00:51:59.838 --> 00:52:02.207
We just got
to get past this game.


1016
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:03.341
Please.

1017
00:52:03.474 --> 00:52:04.810
James...

1018
00:52:04.943 --> 00:52:07.713
Baby, I need you here
with me now, please.


1019
00:52:23.328 --> 00:52:24.963
[mutters]

1020
00:52:34.039 --> 00:52:37.542
Oh, um...
You want Coach.
He's in the back.


1021
00:52:37.675 --> 00:52:39.377
Can you... please?

1022
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.579
Yeah, sure, sure. Sure.
Thank you.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.


1023
00:52:42.547 --> 00:52:44.349
Good to meet you.

1024
00:52:48.419 --> 00:52:49.855
Coach?

1025
00:52:53.759 --> 00:52:55.193
Coach Lazor?

1026
00:53:02.667 --> 00:53:04.669
Morning, Coach.
Uh, Katherine Poe.


1027
00:53:04.803 --> 00:53:06.004
We met earlier?

1028
00:53:06.137 --> 00:53:08.039
Is now okay, sir?

1029
00:53:08.173 --> 00:53:09.941
It's kind of urgent.

1030
00:53:10.075 --> 00:53:11.409
[sighs]

1031
00:53:16.447 --> 00:53:18.216
[clears throat]

1032
00:53:20.051 --> 00:53:21.586
Everything all right?

1033
00:53:22.553 --> 00:53:25.256
Well, if there's
anything I can do...


1034
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:28.326
Just...
What do you want?


1035
00:53:28.459 --> 00:53:30.796
You have a rebellion
on your hands, sir.


1036
00:53:30.929 --> 00:53:33.231
[stammering]
What exactly do you do?


1037
00:53:33.364 --> 00:53:35.901
-You're with the NCAA?
-I'm not. I'm outside counsel.


1038
00:53:36.034 --> 00:53:37.803
And your name again?
Katherine.


1039
00:53:37.936 --> 00:53:40.705
Katherine, would you mind
just fucking off
back to your C-suite?


1040
00:53:47.212 --> 00:53:51.282
This is a private physical
LeMarcus had.


1041
00:53:52.483 --> 00:53:56.754
It's from July
for an insurance policy.


1042
00:53:58.924 --> 00:54:00.525
How did you get that?

1043
00:54:00.658 --> 00:54:04.729
It's a firm specializing
in medical data acquisition.


1044
00:54:06.097 --> 00:54:11.102
And this is an MRI
of LeMarcus' left knee,


1045
00:54:11.236 --> 00:54:14.305
which, unfortunately,
has no cartilage.


1046
00:54:17.042 --> 00:54:19.144
He's been hiding it
for five months.


1047
00:54:22.013 --> 00:54:24.382
His body
is a ticking time bomb.


1048
00:54:24.515 --> 00:54:27.418
It's only a matter of time
before that knee
gives out on him.


1049
00:54:27.552 --> 00:54:30.221
He is never going to be
the number one pick,


1050
00:54:30.355 --> 00:54:32.790
not after the combine
and a physical.


1051
00:54:32.924 --> 00:54:34.692
He'll be lucky
if he got to go day two,


1052
00:54:34.826 --> 00:54:36.494
and he's known that
for some time.


1053
00:54:36.627 --> 00:54:39.330
I have seen nothing to indicate
he's got a bad knee.


1054
00:54:39.464 --> 00:54:43.101
He's 21.
He could eat gunpowder
and then go run a marathon.


1055
00:54:43.234 --> 00:54:45.003
Now, look.

1056
00:54:46.237 --> 00:54:48.940
It's best
if this comes from you.


1057
00:54:50.375 --> 00:54:53.478
How disappointed
you were to learn
that he's been hiding this.


1058
00:54:53.611 --> 00:54:57.849
Maybe, in retrospect,
you did notice the limp
during practice.


1059
00:54:57.983 --> 00:55:00.118
What exactly are you saying?

1060
00:55:00.251 --> 00:55:03.321
Five months ago, LeMarcus
figured out he is not going
to be the number one pick,


1061
00:55:03.454 --> 00:55:06.324
and he is trying to cash in
now before the teller...


1062
00:55:06.457 --> 00:55:08.559
That is bullshit.
Yes, sir. Before
the teller window closes.


1063
00:55:08.693 --> 00:55:11.196
LeMarcus would never--
This is a shakedown, sir!


1064
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:13.464
Pure and simple.

1065
00:55:13.598 --> 00:55:15.666
He is trying
to recoup his losses,


1066
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.635
and he is going
to take everything


1067
00:55:17.768 --> 00:55:20.805
that you and your players
have worked for.


1068
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.476
Let me ask you, sir,
how does a D-III quarterback


1069
00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:28.813
with a noodle
for an arm who runs
a five-flat 40 time,


1070
00:55:28.947 --> 00:55:31.282
how does a guy like that
become the head coach


1071
00:55:31.416 --> 00:55:33.351
of not one but two
D-I powerhouses?


1072
00:55:33.484 --> 00:55:35.987
Because that guy
is a winner.


1073
00:55:36.955 --> 00:55:38.423
And this is your time

1074
00:55:38.556 --> 00:55:40.591
to finally capture
that national title.


1075
00:55:40.725 --> 00:55:44.762
Do not let LeMarcus
rob you of your legacy.


1076
00:55:46.697 --> 00:55:50.668
Now, we will leak this
to the smaller sites.


1077
00:55:50.801 --> 00:55:53.371
You will do a presser
for the networks,


1078
00:55:53.504 --> 00:55:56.174
and the aggregators
will take it from there.


1079
00:55:59.444 --> 00:56:01.012
I, um...

1080
00:56:01.146 --> 00:56:03.181
I have some remarks.

1081
00:56:03.314 --> 00:56:05.016
If you want
to take a look at...
No, thank you.


1082
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:08.353
I don't need
your fucking remarks.


1083
00:56:09.921 --> 00:56:11.856
This is my football team.

1084
00:56:13.158 --> 00:56:15.961
They will play for me.
Coach...


1085
00:56:17.195 --> 00:56:18.296
wake up,

1086
00:56:19.364 --> 00:56:21.766
before you don't
even have a team.


1087
00:56:42.453 --> 00:56:44.155
[inhales deeply]

1088
00:56:50.461 --> 00:56:52.063
[exhales sharply]

1089
00:56:55.233 --> 00:56:57.102
I know right now...

1090
00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:02.040
you think life is always
gonna be like this.


1091
00:57:04.775 --> 00:57:06.877
You're at the center
of everything.


1092
00:57:09.414 --> 00:57:10.748
Alive.

1093
00:57:13.651 --> 00:57:15.086
And greatness

1094
00:57:16.254 --> 00:57:18.023
is right there,

1095
00:57:18.156 --> 00:57:19.690
within reach.

1096
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:26.597
But that's not true.

1097
00:57:28.533 --> 00:57:33.104
This may very well be
your only fleeting moment


1098
00:57:33.238 --> 00:57:35.773
at the top
of the mountain.


1099
00:57:37.475 --> 00:57:39.710
Look at me.
I'm 60 years old.


1100
00:57:41.112 --> 00:57:42.680
I look like I'm 80.

1101
00:57:43.848 --> 00:57:45.950
I feel like I'm a hundred.

1102
00:57:49.687 --> 00:57:51.622
I got a wife that hates me.

1103
00:57:55.126 --> 00:57:57.195
Well, she just left,
actually.


1104
00:58:00.098 --> 00:58:03.101
I got a cock
that doesn't work
without a fucking pill.


1105
00:58:07.605 --> 00:58:08.939
My best buddy,

1106
00:58:10.708 --> 00:58:14.145
since we were
little knuckleheads
playing Pee Wee football...


1107
00:58:15.646 --> 00:58:18.549
My best friend, Clint,
just died of blood cancer.


1108
00:58:20.618 --> 00:58:22.153
Just like that.

1109
00:58:23.821 --> 00:58:26.824
Forty years ago, I was you.

1110
00:58:28.025 --> 00:58:29.627
I was you, men.

1111
00:58:30.628 --> 00:58:32.530
Magnificent.

1112
00:58:32.663 --> 00:58:36.101
Quarterback
of my little college
in North Dakota.


1113
00:58:37.335 --> 00:58:41.172
I had dreams, and I had
the energy to chase 'em.


1114
00:58:42.873 --> 00:58:45.176
-And now...
-[snaps fingers]


1115
00:58:48.679 --> 00:58:50.715
...I got one thing left,

1116
00:58:50.848 --> 00:58:53.784
one thing in my life

1117
00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.422
that means a damn
to me:


1118
00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.735
You men.

1119
00:59:13.104 --> 00:59:14.305
This room.

1120
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:20.878
This is all I got...

1121
00:59:25.049 --> 00:59:26.584
and that's okay.

1122
00:59:28.253 --> 00:59:31.088
Believe me,
this is all I need.


1123
00:59:33.891 --> 00:59:36.694
Now, some of you are
looking at me like, "Well...


1124
00:59:36.827 --> 00:59:38.796
bullshit, Coach.

1125
00:59:38.929 --> 00:59:40.064
Come on, now.

1126
00:59:40.898 --> 00:59:41.899
You got money.

1127
00:59:42.032 --> 00:59:44.569
You're fucking rich."

1128
00:59:44.702 --> 00:59:48.339
Yeah, I got money I...
I couldn't even conceive of


1129
00:59:48.473 --> 00:59:50.775
when I was you men.

1130
00:59:52.243 --> 00:59:54.412
Believe me
when I tell you this--


1131
00:59:55.213 --> 00:59:56.747
Money...

1132
00:59:58.316 --> 00:59:59.717
is shit.

1133
01:00:01.286 --> 01:00:03.554
Money is a numbers game

1134
01:00:03.688 --> 01:00:06.324
played by people
in $5,000 suits


1135
01:00:06.457 --> 01:00:09.294
in New York City offices
for their own benefit.


1136
01:00:09.427 --> 01:00:11.496
There is no glory

1137
01:00:12.797 --> 01:00:13.931
in money,

1138
01:00:14.064 --> 01:00:18.135
no life-altering challenge
in money.


1139
01:00:18.269 --> 01:00:21.272
There is no confrontation
with your deepest fears


1140
01:00:21.406 --> 01:00:25.776
and therefore your greatness,
in fucking money.


1141
01:00:27.478 --> 01:00:28.779
Oh, my God.

1142
01:00:28.913 --> 01:00:31.282
What I wouldn't give
to be you men


1143
01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:33.951
right now.

1144
01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.855
One day away
from glorious battle


1145
01:00:37.988 --> 01:00:40.124
alongside
your band of brothers


1146
01:00:40.258 --> 01:00:44.094
in front of
a hundred million people
all over the world.


1147
01:00:44.229 --> 01:00:45.796
Glory.

1148
01:00:47.798 --> 01:00:51.402
The greatest glory
you are ever gonna feel.


1149
01:00:53.003 --> 01:00:56.006
Do you want
to give that up?


1150
01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.544
For those of you who were
thinking about boycotting,


1151
01:01:00.811 --> 01:01:02.647
you've made your point.

1152
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.615
They are gonna have to change.

1153
01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:07.218
'Cause they heard you.

1154
01:01:07.352 --> 01:01:09.987
They are scared
shitless.


1155
01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.023
It's beautiful.
It's fucking hilarious.


1156
01:01:13.157 --> 01:01:15.960
Change is coming.
Meaningful change.


1157
01:01:16.093 --> 01:01:18.062
Trust me on that.

1158
01:01:19.397 --> 01:01:21.666
Every one of you has worked

1159
01:01:21.799 --> 01:01:25.703
your whole fucking life
for this moment.


1160
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:30.708
Don't rob yourselves
of your destiny.


1161
01:01:31.642 --> 01:01:33.511
Glory is at hand.

1162
01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.147
Glory

1163
01:01:38.215 --> 01:01:40.084
is yours.

1164
01:01:40.217 --> 01:01:43.354
Glory is ours!

1165
01:01:45.623 --> 01:01:47.057
Glory!

1166
01:01:49.327 --> 01:01:50.561
Take it.

1167
01:02:15.052 --> 01:02:18.456
I heard
it was a great speech.


1168
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:22.627
Now, let's prove to them that
LeMarcus is only doing this
for his own benefit,


1169
01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.395
so you have enough players

1170
01:02:24.529 --> 01:02:27.598
not only to play this thing,
but to win.


1171
01:02:30.535 --> 01:02:32.169
Do you need a minute,
Coach?


1172
01:02:32.303 --> 01:02:35.072
You need to
collect yourself? Okay.


1173
01:02:36.273 --> 01:02:38.042
Let's get it over with.

1174
01:02:39.544 --> 01:02:40.878
Right.

1175
01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.716
[indistinct TV chatter]

1176
01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:47.785
One miner's breakfast.

1177
01:02:48.619 --> 01:02:50.421
Breakfast of champions.

1178
01:02:50.555 --> 01:02:52.156
[coughs]

1179
01:02:54.325 --> 01:02:56.461
[newscaster]
Now, I understand we have
some late-breaking news.


1180
01:02:56.594 --> 01:02:58.929
Yes, we're going
to a live press conference


1181
01:02:59.063 --> 01:03:00.931
with Wolves head coach
James Lazor.


1182
01:03:01.065 --> 01:03:04.001
[reporter 1] Coach Lazor,
when did you first notice,


1183
01:03:04.134 --> 01:03:05.936
LeMarcus James' knee?

1184
01:03:06.904 --> 01:03:08.573
[sighs]

1185
01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.842
Well, I had noticed
a slight limp,


1186
01:03:11.976 --> 01:03:14.345
uh, after week three,

1187
01:03:14.479 --> 01:03:17.648
but I just chalked it up
to, you know, the usual
bumps and bruises.


1188
01:03:19.249 --> 01:03:20.951
So, I was, um...

1189
01:03:22.453 --> 01:03:24.455
I was disappointed
when I found out


1190
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:27.358
that he'd been concealing
something more serious.


1191
01:03:27.492 --> 01:03:30.127
I can't believe Coach
is doing this.
[reporter 2] Do you think


1192
01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.397
he concealed his injury
to protect his draft status?


1193
01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:35.232
I don't know.
He's gonna have to pass
a very thorough physical


1194
01:03:35.366 --> 01:03:36.801
before the draft, so...

1195
01:03:38.068 --> 01:03:40.871
They found that MRI quick.
Their man's good.


1196
01:03:41.005 --> 01:03:43.441
[reporter 3] Do you feel he was
manipulating his teammates


1197
01:03:43.574 --> 01:03:45.476
to cash in
on the national title game?


1198
01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:47.812
I guess you'd have
to ask his teammates that.


1199
01:03:47.945 --> 01:03:51.015
Coach, do you feel
that this is a further example


1200
01:03:51.148 --> 01:03:53.384
of a form of modern-day
slave trade?


1201
01:03:59.624 --> 01:04:02.059
I-I'm sorry. I guess I don't
understand that question.


1202
01:04:02.192 --> 01:04:05.530
The physical. Like inspecting
a slave's teeth
to determine the price.


1203
01:04:05.663 --> 01:04:07.331
Only now, it's his knees.

1204
01:04:10.635 --> 01:04:15.540
Well, if you call getting
a free top-tier education


1205
01:04:15.673 --> 01:04:20.010
and four years of
first-class accommodations
and nutrition,


1206
01:04:20.144 --> 01:04:22.980
not to mention
a sizable living stipend,


1207
01:04:23.113 --> 01:04:26.183
and then toss in a once-
in-a-lifetime opportunity


1208
01:04:26.316 --> 01:04:28.118
to play
in a national title game,


1209
01:04:28.252 --> 01:04:30.555
if we're calling that
the slave trade,


1210
01:04:30.688 --> 01:04:32.757
then I'd love
to be a slave.

Um...

1213
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.728
That's...
That's the last question.


1214
01:04:39.664 --> 01:04:41.432
Well, that
already went viral.

[reporters clamoring]

1217
01:04:47.838 --> 01:04:48.906
Call Greeny.

1218
01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.342
Tell him
we're going live.


1219
01:04:52.477 --> 01:04:54.278
Splash it
all over Twitter too.


1220
01:04:55.513 --> 01:04:57.748
I am joined now
by LeMarcus James,


1221
01:04:57.882 --> 01:04:59.784
who won this year's
Heisman Trophy


1222
01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:03.588
and has now rocked
the entire world of sports
and well beyond


1223
01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:06.123
with his boycott
of the national title game,


1224
01:05:06.256 --> 01:05:08.459
which is scheduled
for tomorrow
in New Orleans.


1225
01:05:08.593 --> 01:05:11.195
LeMarcus, I'm gonna jump
right into the question
everyone is asking.


1226
01:05:11.328 --> 01:05:14.899
Are you boycotting this game
and demanding compensation


1227
01:05:15.032 --> 01:05:17.301
because of an unfortunate
medical condition


1228
01:05:17.434 --> 01:05:20.104
that could jeopardize
your status in the draft?


1229
01:05:20.237 --> 01:05:21.606
Good morning, Greeny.

1230
01:05:21.739 --> 01:05:24.241
The answer is no.
Unequivocally, no.


1231
01:05:25.242 --> 01:05:27.144
I have no cartilage
in my left knee.


1232
01:05:27.277 --> 01:05:30.280
It'll degenerate over time.
Maybe eight years, maybe 20.


1233
01:05:30.414 --> 01:05:32.249
But name me an NFL team
that wouldn't take


1234
01:05:32.382 --> 01:05:34.284
eight to 20 years
of elite quarterback play.


1235
01:05:34.418 --> 01:05:37.021
You see, the reality is,
this isn't about me.


1236
01:05:37.154 --> 01:05:38.823
This is about
our current system.


1237
01:05:38.956 --> 01:05:41.458
It's about my fellow
D-I athletes and teammates


1238
01:05:41.592 --> 01:05:42.993
who have fallen victim to,

1239
01:05:43.127 --> 01:05:45.262
quite frankly,
a plantation mentality.


1240
01:05:45.395 --> 01:05:47.331
[Greenberg] I wanna talk
about that mentality.


1241
01:05:47.464 --> 01:05:49.399
That's fucking rich.

1242
01:05:49.534 --> 01:05:51.769
'Cause clearly,
that is at the center
of this entire conversation.


1243
01:05:51.902 --> 01:05:53.504
Your coach, just today,

1244
01:05:53.638 --> 01:05:56.240
said this is a system
he'd love to be a part of


1245
01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:59.309
and even invoked
the tragic word "slavery."


1246
01:05:59.443 --> 01:06:01.679
I have to ask you,
do you feel


1247
01:06:01.812 --> 01:06:05.182
this is a slave trade
of a different kind?


1248
01:06:05.315 --> 01:06:09.654
-[LeMarcus] Can I give you
another comparison, Greeny?
-Yeah, of course.


1249
01:06:09.787 --> 01:06:13.157
This is the home
of my best friend
and teammate, Emmett Sunday.


1250
01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:15.793
Emmett's father is a farmer
outside Lincoln, Nebraska,


1251
01:06:15.926 --> 01:06:17.762
and his mother
is a teacher's assistant.


1252
01:06:17.895 --> 01:06:19.664
They've saved up
a little bit for retirement,


1253
01:06:19.797 --> 01:06:21.799
but mostly, they just live
month to month.


1254
01:06:21.932 --> 01:06:25.335
One swollen appendix,
one turned ankle
from insolvency.


1255
01:06:25.469 --> 01:06:27.872
Now, their son, Emmett Sunday,
has been a four-year starter


1256
01:06:28.005 --> 01:06:30.174
for one of the best college
programs in the country.


1257
01:06:30.307 --> 01:06:31.909
Tomorrow,
he'll play in a game


1258
01:06:32.042 --> 01:06:34.178
that'll gross over
a half a billion dollars.


1259
01:06:34.311 --> 01:06:36.213
Half a billion dollars
for a single game.


1260
01:06:36.346 --> 01:06:37.748
And Emmett
won't see a dime.


1261
01:06:37.882 --> 01:06:39.349
His football days
will be over.


1262
01:06:39.483 --> 01:06:41.919
Zero compensation,
zero medical insurance


1263
01:06:42.052 --> 01:06:44.622
for the injuries
he's sustained,
some of them permanent.


1264
01:06:44.755 --> 01:06:46.323
And now, this...

1265
01:06:47.692 --> 01:06:49.493
is the Palm Beach
vacation home


1266
01:06:49.627 --> 01:06:51.729
for my coach,
James Lazor.


1267
01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.132
This is
his Chicago penthouse.


1268
01:06:57.334 --> 01:06:59.536
This is his
six-bedroom Craftsman,


1269
01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:01.205
where he stays
during the season.


1270
01:07:01.338 --> 01:07:02.740
His work home.

1271
01:07:02.873 --> 01:07:05.042
Now, Coach has profited
off a system


1272
01:07:05.175 --> 01:07:07.377
that is entirely based
on free labor.


1273
01:07:07.511 --> 01:07:09.947
We're not playing in any games
until those who actually play--


1274
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.950
And not just the superstars.
All athletes, down to
the special teams...


1275
01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:16.086
-Jesus.
-...are considered
and compensated.


1276
01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:18.022
[Orlando sighs]
Now.


1277
01:07:18.155 --> 01:07:20.157
This crazy motherfucker.
[chuckles]


1278
01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:22.727
There you have it,
directly from
LeMarcus James.


1279
01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.229
LeMarcus,
thank you very much.
All right, LeMarcus.


1280
01:07:25.362 --> 01:07:27.898
[Greenberg]
I appreciate the time.
We'll take a short break,


1281
01:07:28.032 --> 01:07:30.167
and be back with more
in just a moment.


1282
01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.603
What the calamitous fuck?

1283
01:07:32.737 --> 01:07:35.139
We've been goddamn
outflanked by two kids,


1284
01:07:35.272 --> 01:07:36.941
like we're
in Scooby fucking Doo.


1285
01:07:37.074 --> 01:07:39.109
Oh, you know what
the dipshit sidekick did


1286
01:07:39.243 --> 01:07:41.578
when LeMarcus
was grandstanding on TV?


1287
01:07:41.712 --> 01:07:42.980
[Katherine] Sunday.
Huh?


1288
01:07:43.113 --> 01:07:44.815
His name is
Emmett Sunday.


1289
01:07:44.949 --> 01:07:46.583
Oh, thank God
we got that all cleared up.


1290
01:07:46.717 --> 01:07:51.021
Emmett fucking-us-sideways
Sunday leaks
my Nike contract.


1291
01:07:51.155 --> 01:07:53.223
Now every New York City
zig-zag's


1292
01:07:53.357 --> 01:07:55.592
asking me where
$30 million a year goes.


1293
01:07:55.726 --> 01:07:57.061
[Katherine]
Where does it go?


1294
01:07:57.194 --> 01:07:58.763
How the hell do I know?

1295
01:07:58.896 --> 01:08:00.865
You're the head
of the conference.


1296
01:08:00.998 --> 01:08:02.199
Excuse me?

1297
01:08:02.332 --> 01:08:04.234
You're the head
of your conference.


1298
01:08:04.368 --> 01:08:07.271
You should be able to answer
a layup like where
your sneaker money goes.


1299
01:08:08.438 --> 01:08:10.174
Okay.

1300
01:08:10.307 --> 01:08:11.475
Band fields.

1301
01:08:11.608 --> 01:08:13.177
Softball stadiums.
[cell phone chimes]


1302
01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:16.446
Turquoise-green
Bermuda fucking sod.
Where else?


1303
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.716
Orlando Bishop
just tweeted this.


1304
01:08:18.849 --> 01:08:20.317
He's out.
[Everly] That's cute.


1305
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:22.419
We got four players
threatening to walk now too.


1306
01:08:22.552 --> 01:08:23.954
How are these two
even doing this?


1307
01:08:24.088 --> 01:08:25.589
I still think
Coach Lazor's the one


1308
01:08:25.723 --> 01:08:27.324
to talk LeMarcus
off this ledge.


1309
01:08:27.457 --> 01:08:29.493
He walks him back,
they'll all follow.


1310
01:08:29.626 --> 01:08:31.395
Where's your coach now?

1311
01:08:31.528 --> 01:08:33.864
He's, uh,
taking a minute.


1312
01:08:33.998 --> 01:08:35.332
[Katherine]
He's tanking.


1313
01:08:35.465 --> 01:08:37.267
He's fine.
[Mike] What does he need?


1314
01:08:37.401 --> 01:08:39.269
A divorce lawyer.
[Everly chuckles]


1315
01:08:39.403 --> 01:08:41.772
[Everly] He's fine, I said.
Lazor or no Lazor,


1316
01:08:41.906 --> 01:08:43.440
we're putting two teams
on the field tomorrow,


1317
01:08:43.573 --> 01:08:45.542
even if we gotta dress
the damn cheerleaders.


1318
01:08:45.676 --> 01:08:47.812
Who's second in line
if Lazor can't go?


1319
01:08:47.945 --> 01:08:51.882
I guess, uh, Ronnie Dunn,
defensive coordinator.


1320
01:08:52.016 --> 01:08:53.951
You trust him?
Yeah. Company man.


1321
01:08:54.084 --> 01:08:55.953
Been at the university
since a player himself,


1322
01:08:56.086 --> 01:08:57.855
so, yeah, he'll take
marching orders.


1323
01:08:57.988 --> 01:09:00.290
-You sure?
-This a fucking inquisition?


1324
01:09:00.424 --> 01:09:03.894
I don't trust anyone
with a vested pension
and Medicare.


1325
01:09:05.095 --> 01:09:06.797
Oh, God. You know what?

1326
01:09:06.931 --> 01:09:08.999
Fuck you very much.

1327
01:09:09.133 --> 01:09:12.436
All right? I need this shit
like I need a third tit.


1328
01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:14.872
I will march
my entire conference


1329
01:09:15.005 --> 01:09:16.506
right out that door,

1330
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.045
put together
my own play-offs
without any of you.


1331
01:09:21.178 --> 01:09:22.646
How do you like me?

1332
01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:24.849
You'd be in breach
of 16 different contracts,


1333
01:09:24.982 --> 01:09:28.652
squander a $100-million payday
for tomorrow alone.


1334
01:09:28.786 --> 01:09:32.022
Not to mention what I imagine
would be a full audit


1335
01:09:32.156 --> 01:09:35.292
of SEC expenses
under your tenure.


1336
01:09:35.425 --> 01:09:38.328
You know, to make sure
that those band fields,
softball stadiums


1337
01:09:38.462 --> 01:09:42.199
and turquoise-green
Bermuda sod
weren't really just


1338
01:09:42.332 --> 01:09:45.702
high-paid escorts
in New York City


1339
01:09:45.836 --> 01:09:48.939
at the Bemelman Bar
of the Carlyle.


1340
01:09:53.077 --> 01:09:56.013
Bouncing 'em
out of your apartment
three at a time, right?


1341
01:10:04.154 --> 01:10:05.722
Fuck you.

1342
01:10:06.323 --> 01:10:07.391
[scoffs]

1343
01:10:08.793 --> 01:10:10.027
Hoo!

1344
01:10:15.165 --> 01:10:17.367
[person] We're still

1345
01:10:17.501 --> 01:10:19.703
from the Snickers
National Title game.


1346
01:10:19.837 --> 01:10:21.772
-Only the biggest game...
-[person 2] Man, these guys


1347
01:10:21.906 --> 01:10:23.440
are already getting
free education.


1348
01:10:23.573 --> 01:10:25.742
Money is just
gonna ruin it.


1349
01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:27.677
They aren't ready
for all that money.
I wasn't when I was 18.


1350
01:10:27.812 --> 01:10:30.014
[person 3] I don't know
if this man is a racist,


1351
01:10:30.147 --> 01:10:32.282
but what I do know
is that he made a fortune


1352
01:10:32.416 --> 01:10:35.685
mostly off the backs
of young Black men.


1353
01:10:36.821 --> 01:10:38.422
[Bailey] Question.

1354
01:10:38.555 --> 01:10:40.925
If I hadn't stayed here
to explain to you


1355
01:10:41.058 --> 01:10:44.494
that I was leaving,
would you have noticed
I'd gone?


1356
01:10:46.296 --> 01:10:48.465

[person]
Coach! Coach Lazor!


1359
01:11:10.287 --> 01:11:12.823
-[person 2] Oh, my God.
Look, it's Coach Lazor.
-[people clamoring]


1360
01:11:12.957 --> 01:11:14.825
[person 3] Hey, Coach,
can we get a picture?
Sorry, buddy.


1361
01:11:14.959 --> 01:11:17.761
It's just really
not a good time, okay?
Sorry, sorry...


1362
01:11:17.895 --> 01:11:20.597
-[clamoring continues]
-Okay, not now!


1363
01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:24.001
Hey, give him some space.
Give him some space.


1364
01:11:24.134 --> 01:11:25.602
No pictures! No pictures!

1365
01:11:25.735 --> 01:11:27.071
Have a good game, Coach!

1366
01:11:44.488 --> 01:11:47.057
[Everly] Now, I know for a fact
that LeMarcus and the guys,


1367
01:11:47.191 --> 01:11:48.859
they respect
the hell out of you,


1368
01:11:48.993 --> 01:11:54.298
and you would be the first
African-American head coach


1369
01:11:54.431 --> 01:11:59.203
to lead a team onto the field
for a national title game.


1370
01:12:00.037 --> 01:12:01.638
Hell,

1371
01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:04.008
hopefully win the thing, huh?

1372
01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:06.376
Let's make history together.

1373
01:12:23.627 --> 01:12:25.996
The NCAA may have started
with this...


1374
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.232
[Emmett groans]
...imaginary
pie-in-the-sky idea


1375
01:12:28.365 --> 01:12:30.800
that it was about amateurism,
and at one point it was.


1376
01:12:30.935 --> 01:12:34.338
But then there was a turn,
and it became about money.


1377
01:12:34.471 --> 01:12:37.307
[knocking]
Plain and simple.
I thought this was America.


1378
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:39.176
[coughing]
Yeah?


1379
01:12:39.309 --> 01:12:41.078
It's Coach Dunn.

1380
01:12:42.779 --> 01:12:44.581
[Emmett] You all
by your lonesome?


1381
01:12:44.714 --> 01:12:47.184
[groans]
[Coach Dunn]
It's just me.


1382
01:12:47.317 --> 01:12:49.053
[door unlocks]

1383
01:12:50.054 --> 01:12:51.088
Coach?

1384
01:12:51.221 --> 01:12:53.890
You two are really hard
to find.


1385
01:12:54.024 --> 01:12:56.860
It's easier to find Bigfoot
than to find you two.


1386
01:12:57.861 --> 01:12:59.563
Look, relax.
I won't tell Lazor.


1387
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:02.366
[chuckles softly]
You know something?


1388
01:13:02.499 --> 01:13:04.901
I gotta give credit
to you two, actually.


1389
01:13:05.035 --> 01:13:07.571
I'm really surprised
you was able to pull this off.


1390
01:13:09.606 --> 01:13:11.308
But you got trouble.

1391
01:13:12.509 --> 01:13:14.611
Yep, they still gonna
play the game.


1392
01:13:17.081 --> 01:13:18.615
With 19 freshmen?

1393
01:13:19.516 --> 01:13:21.051
Cornelius?

1394
01:13:21.185 --> 01:13:22.886
They don't care who plays
as long as it's on TV.


1395
01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:25.089
[Emmett scoffs]

1396
01:13:25.222 --> 01:13:27.091
The shit bowl.

1397
01:13:27.224 --> 01:13:29.226
[Coach Dunn] They shitting
their pants right now.


1398
01:13:29.359 --> 01:13:31.395
They got so desperate,
they approached me


1399
01:13:31.528 --> 01:13:33.463
and said
If Lazor doesn't show up,


1400
01:13:33.597 --> 01:13:35.532
I can bring the team
out to the field.


1401
01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.602
So, Coach is sitting?

1402
01:13:38.735 --> 01:13:40.604
[sighs] I don't know, man.
It's really hard
to tell right now,


1403
01:13:40.737 --> 01:13:42.439
but it looks like it.

1404
01:13:42.572 --> 01:13:43.540
Damn.

1405
01:13:43.673 --> 01:13:45.842
So, what you gonna do?

1406
01:13:45.976 --> 01:13:48.512
The first Black head coach
in a national title game?


1407
01:13:48.645 --> 01:13:50.347
It's a big deal.

1408
01:13:51.615 --> 01:13:54.851
I ain't no fucking pawn.
Hell, no, I'm not doing it.


1409
01:13:54.985 --> 01:13:56.953
I'm one of best defensive
coaches in this country.


1410
01:13:57.087 --> 01:13:58.455
I don't need
no fucking handouts.


1411
01:13:58.588 --> 01:13:59.990
Amen, Coach.

1412
01:14:00.124 --> 01:14:01.591
We feel the same way.

1413
01:14:01.725 --> 01:14:03.860
Even if this whole thing
goes up in a ball of flames,


1414
01:14:03.994 --> 01:14:05.762
we're not stepping
on that field.


1415
01:14:08.265 --> 01:14:11.101
Look, y'all.
Have I ever told you
the Hannibal Lawson story?


1416
01:14:11.235 --> 01:14:13.370
Who?
Hannibal Lawson.


1417
01:14:13.503 --> 01:14:16.573
So, Han Lawson, to me, was one
of the best defensive tackles


1418
01:14:16.706 --> 01:14:18.442
in Louisiana
high school history.


1419
01:14:18.575 --> 01:14:20.344
He went on to LSU.

1420
01:14:20.477 --> 01:14:22.446
You know, a bright future.

1421
01:14:23.547 --> 01:14:25.282
He got his knee shredded
in practice.


1422
01:14:25.415 --> 01:14:28.118
And the result of that,
they took his scholarship away.


1423
01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.289
But Hannibal did
something interesting.


1424
01:14:32.422 --> 01:14:35.325
He hired
a lawyer in a cheap suit
with some night-school degree,


1425
01:14:35.459 --> 01:14:38.195
and he sued the NCAA
for workmen's comp.


1426
01:14:38.328 --> 01:14:40.197
-Smart, right?
-Yeah.


1427
01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:42.632
Went all the way to
the Louisiana Supreme Court.


1428
01:14:42.766 --> 01:14:44.434
[Emmett] What happened?

1429
01:14:44.568 --> 01:14:46.336
Student-athlete.

1430
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:48.805
[Coach Dunn]
Yeah, they said he was nothing
but a student-athlete.


1431
01:14:48.938 --> 01:14:50.974
They didn't consider him
an employee, even though
they were selling


1432
01:14:51.108 --> 01:14:52.742
hundreds and thousands
of tickets


1433
01:14:52.876 --> 01:14:55.412
every fucking Saturday,
making millions of dollars!


1434
01:14:55.545 --> 01:14:59.049
You're breaking your body
every fucking practice
and every game.


1435
01:14:59.183 --> 01:15:01.818
And whenever they decide
to take the scholarship
away from you, they can,


1436
01:15:01.951 --> 01:15:03.487
whenever the fuck
they feel like it.


1437
01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:06.423
That's a crazy,
sick system.


1438
01:15:06.556 --> 01:15:09.726
And maybe you two
will change it.
I don't know.


1439
01:15:09.859 --> 01:15:13.497
But I want y'all to understand
something. There's a lot
of Han Lawsons out here.


1440
01:15:14.731 --> 01:15:16.166
Survival of the fittest.

1441
01:15:17.867 --> 01:15:19.636
America.

1442
01:15:21.105 --> 01:15:23.073
This little pigskin football
right here


1443
01:15:23.207 --> 01:15:24.574
holds a lot of weight to it.

1444
01:15:24.708 --> 01:15:26.476
It's more than a game.

1445
01:15:26.610 --> 01:15:28.412
It's a fucking business.

1446
01:15:32.949 --> 01:15:34.318
Hey, Coach.

1447
01:15:35.352 --> 01:15:37.087
Thank you.

1448
01:15:38.054 --> 01:15:39.523
Good luck, fellas.

1449
01:15:40.824 --> 01:15:42.726
[coughs]

1450
01:15:45.862 --> 01:15:48.064
[sighs]
[door closes]


1451
01:15:48.198 --> 01:15:50.033
We're gonna need Cecil
on board.


1452
01:15:50.167 --> 01:15:53.703
We both don't play,
the advertisers
will start pulling out.


1453
01:15:55.038 --> 01:15:56.440
It's the only way.

1454
01:15:57.441 --> 01:15:59.543
[blues rock music playing]

1455
01:15:59.676 --> 01:16:01.878
[Rodgers] Take a little more
of the edge off.


1456
01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.915
Gotta let it out.

1457
01:16:06.049 --> 01:16:08.918
If you don't,
it just stays inside you,
it becomes poison.


1458
01:16:09.052 --> 01:16:10.754
[Taylor sighs]

1459
01:16:10.887 --> 01:16:13.590
Okay, what's the plan?
Damn it.


1460
01:16:13.723 --> 01:16:15.659
I can't even focus
on that right now.


1461
01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:19.095
Well, you... you got to.
You gotta bifurcate.


1462
01:16:19.229 --> 01:16:23.467
Uh, I don't know what
that means, but I think
I get the gist of it.


1463
01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.435
About to lose 500,000
'cause of LeMarcus.


1464
01:16:25.569 --> 01:16:26.636
[Rodgers] Taylor.
He fucked us.


1465
01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:28.071
-Put the phone down.
-He fucked us.


1466
01:16:28.205 --> 01:16:29.873
-Put the phone down.
-All right.


1467
01:16:30.006 --> 01:16:32.542
Coach, I know you don't want
to hear this right now.


1468
01:16:32.676 --> 01:16:35.612
I've been married
three times myself.


1469
01:16:35.745 --> 01:16:37.914
But the hurt goes away.

1470
01:16:38.047 --> 01:16:39.316
Poof.

1471
01:16:39.449 --> 01:16:41.485
One day, just like that.
Gone.


1472
01:16:41.618 --> 01:16:44.321
I'm telling you,
Bailey's my one and only.


1473
01:16:44.454 --> 01:16:47.457
And she's gone.
And it's my own goddamn fault.


1474
01:16:47.591 --> 01:16:49.159
[Taylor] Coach,
no offense at all.


1475
01:16:49.293 --> 01:16:51.228
Your love life,
that's your thing.


1476
01:16:51.361 --> 01:16:52.829
Your racial views,
that's your thing.


1477
01:16:52.962 --> 01:16:55.365
But we have
a national title
in less than 24 hours.


1478
01:16:55.499 --> 01:16:57.801
Can you please
just focus on that?
Fucking racial views?


1479
01:16:57.934 --> 01:16:59.436
First of all,
one goddamn reporter


1480
01:16:59.569 --> 01:17:01.004
baits me into saying
something stupid.


1481
01:17:01.137 --> 01:17:02.639
I know
you're not racist.


1482
01:17:02.772 --> 01:17:04.374
I'm just saying we got
the game to focus on, okay?


1483
01:17:04.508 --> 01:17:06.210
That's all I'm saying.
What fucking game?


1484
01:17:06.343 --> 01:17:08.312
I don't have
a goddamn team.
Less than 24 hours.


1485
01:17:08.445 --> 01:17:11.648
I'm supposed
to walk out of that tunnel
with-- with freshmen.


1486
01:17:11.781 --> 01:17:14.218
Nobody's askin' you...
and go in there and get
our ass kicked?


1487
01:17:14.351 --> 01:17:17.053
You gotta figure it out.
That's not competition.
That's a fucking slaughter.


1488
01:17:17.187 --> 01:17:18.688
I'm doing what I can.

1489
01:17:18.822 --> 01:17:20.790
You gotta do better, Coach.
You're under contract.


1490
01:17:20.924 --> 01:17:22.626
Con...
Fuck that contract.


1491
01:17:22.759 --> 01:17:25.195
Are you talking to me
about the fucking contract
right now?


1492
01:17:25.329 --> 01:17:26.830
I could walk
across the street tomorrow


1493
01:17:26.963 --> 01:17:28.832
and get another contract
if they find me in breach.


1494
01:17:28.965 --> 01:17:31.201
I don't give a shit.
I don't need
the goddamn money anyway.


1495
01:17:31.335 --> 01:17:32.702
Coach,
you're hurtin' right now.


1496
01:17:32.836 --> 01:17:36.039
Let's just give it
an hour or two.


1497
01:17:36.172 --> 01:17:37.841
See the state of play.

1498
01:17:37.974 --> 01:17:41.144
It's best not to make
any decisions feeling this way.


1499
01:17:42.679 --> 01:17:44.214
Tell you what.
It's the ones


1500
01:17:44.348 --> 01:17:47.150
that are closest to us
that hurt us the most.


1501
01:18:05.969 --> 01:18:08.372
You as good
as they say you are?


1502
01:18:08.505 --> 01:18:11.207
To which of my many talents
are you referring?


1503
01:18:12.509 --> 01:18:14.911
There was a fight
that no one knows about.


1504
01:18:15.044 --> 01:18:17.381
A real brawl.
A kid got hurt bad.


1505
01:18:17.514 --> 01:18:20.717
I'll alert the authorities.
Oh, they know.


1506
01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:24.254
He's blind in one eye now
and got a hole in his skull.


1507
01:18:25.922 --> 01:18:28.925
But money talks,
and NDAs don't.


1508
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:35.565
I'm listening.

1509
01:18:38.335 --> 01:18:39.703
LeMarcus.

1510
01:18:41.805 --> 01:18:43.039
[shower running]

1511
01:18:43.172 --> 01:18:45.942
[practicing Italian]

1512
01:18:46.075 --> 01:18:48.845
Oh, crap,
I think I just called you
my pistachio. [laughs]


1513
01:18:48.978 --> 01:18:52.449
Your phone sucks.
Is mine in there?


1514
01:18:52.582 --> 01:18:54.183
It is here.

1515
01:18:54.318 --> 01:18:56.052
[Bailey] Ah.

1516
01:18:56.185 --> 01:18:59.323
You just got a text
from a guy
named Mike Titus.


1517
01:18:59.456 --> 01:19:01.291
What? Crap.

1518
01:19:01.425 --> 01:19:04.894
I just must have grabbed
James' personal one again
by accident.


1519
01:19:05.028 --> 01:19:08.832
[Italian accent]
Can you bring it to me,
mi pistachio?


1520
01:19:10.266 --> 01:19:12.302
It's probably goin' ape-shit
right now.


1521
01:19:12.436 --> 01:19:14.438
After everything we've done
for LeMarcus.


1522
01:19:14.571 --> 01:19:17.907
Every single one of those kids
are spoiled brats.


1523
01:19:18.041 --> 01:19:19.943
Spoiled freaking brats.

1524
01:19:20.076 --> 01:19:22.479
Geez. [chuckles]

1525
01:19:22.612 --> 01:19:26.650
Oh, I cannot wait
to go to Rome.


1526
01:19:26.783 --> 01:19:29.619
There's this one place
that I want to eat at,


1527
01:19:29.753 --> 01:19:32.922
and they still have
the bullet holes
in the walls from the war.


1528
01:19:33.056 --> 01:19:36.593
Do you see this?
Probably not,
'cause your phone stinks.


1529
01:19:40.364 --> 01:19:41.465
What?

1530
01:19:44.368 --> 01:19:46.302
I've been helping LeMarcus.

1531
01:19:49.038 --> 01:19:50.774
What?

1532
01:19:50.907 --> 01:19:52.676
You know, with his boycott.

1533
01:19:52.809 --> 01:19:54.411
That's why I'm here.

1534
01:19:56.045 --> 01:19:57.847
I don't get it.

1535
01:19:59.849 --> 01:20:02.185
He came to me after class.

1536
01:20:03.186 --> 01:20:04.654
And... [sighs]

1537
01:20:05.755 --> 01:20:07.290
...what was I gonna do?

1538
01:20:08.257 --> 01:20:10.226
Be another
tenured paper tiger?


1539
01:20:11.795 --> 01:20:13.897
Teaching organized labor
five days a week,


1540
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:16.400
then hide behind my desk
when one of my own students


1541
01:20:16.533 --> 01:20:18.702
actually wants
to do something about it?


1542
01:20:20.604 --> 01:20:22.372
So...

1543
01:20:22.506 --> 01:20:23.873
I helped him

1544
01:20:25.008 --> 01:20:26.976
with his strategy

1545
01:20:27.777 --> 01:20:29.413
any way I could.

1546
01:20:31.481 --> 01:20:32.616
It's funny.

1547
01:20:32.749 --> 01:20:34.851
LeMarcus knew
the rumors about us,


1548
01:20:34.984 --> 01:20:36.720
like everybody else.

1549
01:20:36.853 --> 01:20:38.655
Except your husband,
of course.


1550
01:20:39.956 --> 01:20:43.192
And you, calling LeMarcus
a spoiled brat,


1551
01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.731
especially when he has
so much to lose.


1552
01:20:49.666 --> 01:20:53.202
Maybe you're more part
of the system than you think.
Get out.


1553
01:20:55.338 --> 01:20:57.507
[voice breaking]
Get the fuck out of here.


1554
01:21:02.178 --> 01:21:03.447
Leave!

1555
01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:15.559
[door closes]

1556
01:21:18.528 --> 01:21:19.596
[sobs]

1557
01:21:26.536 --> 01:21:28.237
[whispers] Fuck me.

1558
01:21:28.371 --> 01:21:29.539
[sobs]

1559
01:21:47.491 --> 01:21:49.058
[knocking]

1560
01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:55.198
[sighs]

1561
01:22:05.108 --> 01:22:07.310
Oh, sorry. I think
we got the wrong room.


1562
01:22:07.443 --> 01:22:09.312
No.
This room is Cecil's.


1563
01:22:09.445 --> 01:22:11.781
Come in.
We don't have a lot of time.


1564
01:22:20.089 --> 01:22:22.659
My name's Katherine Poe.
I come bearing gifts.


1565
01:22:22.792 --> 01:22:24.761
You need my phone?

1566
01:22:28.231 --> 01:22:29.533
You look rough.

1567
01:22:29.666 --> 01:22:31.801
Just a cold.

1568
01:22:31.935 --> 01:22:33.436
Where's Cecil?

1569
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:36.172
They're in a suite
ten floors up, playing 2K.


1570
01:22:37.641 --> 01:22:39.108
No, wait.

1571
01:22:39.242 --> 01:22:41.578
[chuckles] You haven't
even heard my offer yet.


1572
01:22:41.711 --> 01:22:44.313
It's a pretty good offer.
A lot of wonderful things.


1573
01:22:44.447 --> 01:22:46.182
A lot of meat
on the bone.


1574
01:22:51.387 --> 01:22:52.956
Okay.

1575
01:22:53.089 --> 01:22:54.924
What you got?

1576
01:22:55.058 --> 01:22:57.360
I send the best concierge
doctor in New Orleans,


1577
01:22:57.493 --> 01:22:59.128
Dr. Eric, to your room.

1578
01:22:59.262 --> 01:23:02.699
He gives you an IV, a Z-Pak,
you get plenty of rest,


1579
01:23:02.832 --> 01:23:05.001
you and your team
play the game,


1580
01:23:06.335 --> 01:23:08.471
and you go number one
overall in April.


1581
01:23:08.605 --> 01:23:10.006
All your dreams
come true.


1582
01:23:10.139 --> 01:23:11.741
And...

1583
01:23:11.875 --> 01:23:14.678
I will personally
make sure


1584
01:23:14.811 --> 01:23:18.214
that the NCAA forms
an exploratory committee


1585
01:23:18.347 --> 01:23:21.484
to fully monetize
amateur athletics.


1586
01:23:21.618 --> 01:23:23.920
"Exploratory committee"?
Yeah, that's gonna
be a pass.


1587
01:23:24.053 --> 01:23:27.056
[Katherine] No, wait.
You haven't heard
the cherry on top.


1588
01:23:28.324 --> 01:23:30.493
Best part is,
you don't go to jail.


1589
01:23:32.395 --> 01:23:34.731
[scoffs] For boycottin'
a football game?


1590
01:23:34.864 --> 01:23:38.067
For the attempted murder
of K.C. Walton.


1591
01:23:43.106 --> 01:23:44.473
[Emmett] Wow.

1592
01:23:45.508 --> 01:23:47.410
Wow!

1593
01:23:47.543 --> 01:23:50.980
For the last 48 hours,
you guys have been trying
to destroy this man!


1594
01:23:51.114 --> 01:23:53.416
And what, you land
on outright assassination?


1595
01:23:53.549 --> 01:23:56.753
For what, money?
K.C. Walton is blind
in one eye.


1596
01:23:56.886 --> 01:23:58.922
He has a crack
in his skull,


1597
01:23:59.055 --> 01:24:03.259
and he hasn't walked the same
ever since that fight
outside of the, uh,


1598
01:24:03.392 --> 01:24:06.362
Gin Mill Bar and Grill.

1599
01:24:08.397 --> 01:24:10.433
So I spoke to his mother,

1600
01:24:10.566 --> 01:24:12.368
and she jumped at the idea
of being able to...
[whispers] It's bullshit.


1601
01:24:12.501 --> 01:24:14.638
It's not bullshit!

1602
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:17.974
She jumped at the idea
of being able
to throw out that NDA


1603
01:24:18.107 --> 01:24:20.877
and burn that 100K
that was used to buy them off


1604
01:24:21.010 --> 01:24:23.446
if it meant that
she could find the guys


1605
01:24:23.579 --> 01:24:26.449
who hurt her son
and get paid again.


1606
01:24:26.582 --> 01:24:29.452
You don't know
what you're doing.
Hey. No.


1607
01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.088
She ain't got nothin'.

1608
01:24:32.221 --> 01:24:33.890
Let's get outta here.

1609
01:24:35.859 --> 01:24:37.293
I got Reggie.

1610
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:42.699
Your half-brother.

1611
01:24:47.704 --> 01:24:49.138
So you spoke to him?

1612
01:24:50.707 --> 01:24:52.776
Haven't found him yet.

1613
01:24:52.909 --> 01:24:56.379
When I do, I promise you,
I am going to piece together


1614
01:24:56.512 --> 01:24:58.915
what exactly happened
that night.


1615
01:24:59.048 --> 01:25:01.651
LeMarcus, wake up.

1616
01:25:03.086 --> 01:25:05.889
How do you think
it is gonna look
when someone like Reggie,


1617
01:25:06.022 --> 01:25:08.591
who has two felony
possession charges


1618
01:25:08.725 --> 01:25:10.660
and assault and battery,
shows up


1619
01:25:10.794 --> 01:25:12.862
in front of an all-white jury
in Missouri


1620
01:25:12.996 --> 01:25:14.497
with
attempted-murder charges


1621
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:17.600
to a guy who is
permanently injured?


1622
01:25:18.835 --> 01:25:20.837
One look at that jack,
and I'd be able to know


1623
01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:22.872
that he was the one
that kicked K.C.'s ass.


1624
01:25:23.807 --> 01:25:26.109
But guess what?
This is America.


1625
01:25:26.242 --> 01:25:28.712
[whispers] Nobody cares
about your brother.


1626
01:25:29.412 --> 01:25:30.479
Nobody.

1627
01:25:32.248 --> 01:25:35.218
[normal voice] The only one
they were able to spot
that night in that melee


1628
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:39.222
was one LeMarcus James,
star quarterback.


1629
01:25:39.355 --> 01:25:41.624
And so the state police
picked you up


1630
01:25:41.758 --> 01:25:43.159
and hit you with charges,

1631
01:25:43.292 --> 01:25:45.194
but some
deep-pocketed booster,


1632
01:25:45.328 --> 01:25:47.430
who I think
I just fucking met,


1633
01:25:47.563 --> 01:25:48.631
stepped in

1634
01:25:48.765 --> 01:25:51.334
and paid off K.C.
and his family.


1635
01:25:51.467 --> 01:25:53.469
Because that's what we do
in big football, right?


1636
01:25:53.602 --> 01:25:56.105
You protect the phenom

1637
01:25:56.239 --> 01:25:59.876
when he has a chance
of bringing home that
national title this year.


1638
01:26:00.009 --> 01:26:01.878
Sound about right?

1639
01:26:03.479 --> 01:26:07.316
I suggest you let
Dr. Eric patch you up tonight,


1640
01:26:07.450 --> 01:26:10.987
and then we do
a joint press conference
in the morning.


1641
01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.858
All the head honchos
up in the penthouse,


1642
01:26:14.991 --> 01:26:16.659
heads bowed,

1643
01:26:16.793 --> 01:26:19.328
agreeing that,
yes, there is a problem.


1644
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:22.698
And then you play.

1645
01:26:22.832 --> 01:26:26.169
You win, and you get
to take that victory lap


1646
01:26:26.302 --> 01:26:28.938
you have been
dreaming about since...


1647
01:26:29.072 --> 01:26:31.374
since you stood
on the sidelines


1648
01:26:31.507 --> 01:26:34.177
watching your big brother
in north Virginia.


1649
01:26:35.711 --> 01:26:39.949
And then change does come
because of you, eventually.


1650
01:26:40.083 --> 01:26:43.119
And that is something
you both can be proud of.


1651
01:26:44.087 --> 01:26:46.756
I got a question.

1652
01:26:46.890 --> 01:26:49.926
Are you completely
fucking heartless,
or just a little bit?


1653
01:26:50.059 --> 01:26:52.561
Oh, my God.
[Emmett] How do you live
with yourself?


1654
01:26:52.695 --> 01:26:56.499
Honestly, how do you live
with yourself?
[shouts] I am not heartless!


1655
01:26:56.632 --> 01:26:58.501
You do not know me!

1656
01:27:00.203 --> 01:27:03.006
You think I don't know
your struggle?


1657
01:27:03.139 --> 01:27:06.810
You think I don't know
what you have come from?
That I haven't been there?


1658
01:27:07.877 --> 01:27:09.578
You think I don't know
what it's like


1659
01:27:09.712 --> 01:27:11.747
to be without heat
in your house?


1660
01:27:11.881 --> 01:27:13.382
That I don't know
what it's like


1661
01:27:13.516 --> 01:27:15.684
to not be able
to afford your jersey,


1662
01:27:15.819 --> 01:27:17.320
and you are
avoiding your coach


1663
01:27:17.453 --> 01:27:20.056
'cause you don't have
the $50 to pay for it?


1664
01:27:21.757 --> 01:27:24.460
[voice breaking]
I ran track at Duke, okay?


1665
01:27:25.895 --> 01:27:27.263
Full ride.

1666
01:27:27.396 --> 01:27:29.332
No big medals, no big wins.

1667
01:27:29.465 --> 01:27:32.802
But I took that money
because it was the only way
I was gonna run myself


1668
01:27:32.936 --> 01:27:35.671
out of that
Red Hook project.


1669
01:27:35.805 --> 01:27:38.407
[scoffs]
You think you know me.


1670
01:27:39.775 --> 01:27:41.644
You don't know me.

1671
01:27:41.777 --> 01:27:45.614
I had to fight and climb

1672
01:27:45.748 --> 01:27:48.084
and crawl to be here

1673
01:27:48.217 --> 01:27:50.219
because I did the work.

1674
01:27:53.556 --> 01:27:58.594
The NCAA spends $3.6 billion

1675
01:27:58.727 --> 01:28:02.298
on student-athlete
scholarships for kids like me,


1676
01:28:02.431 --> 01:28:04.934
like you and like you,

1677
01:28:06.302 --> 01:28:08.504
so that we can get a leg up.

1678
01:28:08.637 --> 01:28:10.573
And what happens
to all of that


1679
01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:13.642
when they start paying you?

1680
01:28:13.776 --> 01:28:15.244
Hmm?

1681
01:28:15.378 --> 01:28:19.615
What happens to volleyball
in Minnesota,


1682
01:28:19.748 --> 01:28:21.650
to soccer in Idaho,

1683
01:28:21.784 --> 01:28:23.953
to softball in South Carolina?

1684
01:28:24.087 --> 01:28:26.455
What happens to
all of those other sports


1685
01:28:26.589 --> 01:28:30.193
that are not men's football
and basketball?


1686
01:28:32.195 --> 01:28:35.731
You out here fighting,
and you forgot
who you're fighting for.


1687
01:28:38.301 --> 01:28:41.370
You know, but...
[clears throat, sighs]


1688
01:28:42.471 --> 01:28:44.173
Hey, what do I know?

1689
01:28:45.341 --> 01:28:46.809
I'm heartless.

1690
01:29:00.256 --> 01:29:01.790
[door opens]

1691
01:29:03.526 --> 01:29:04.994
[door closes]

1692
01:29:08.631 --> 01:29:10.833
[crowd chattering]

1693
01:29:24.147 --> 01:29:27.450
[on TV] Hi, everybody, and
good morning from the Big Easy.
I'm Steve Levy.


1694
01:29:27.583 --> 01:29:29.218
We are some 12 hours away

1695
01:29:29.352 --> 01:29:32.055
from tonight's Snickers
National Title game.


1696
01:29:32.188 --> 01:29:34.223
Now, I'm being told
that a midnight deal


1697
01:29:34.357 --> 01:29:36.892
may have been brokered
with LeMarcus James.


1698
01:29:37.026 --> 01:29:39.795
Details still remain
a little bit sketchy,


1699
01:29:39.929 --> 01:29:43.066
but there's
a news conference scheduled
for a couple hours from now.


1700
01:29:43.199 --> 01:29:45.268
My sources tell me
that both teams


1701
01:29:45.401 --> 01:29:46.902
could be
at full strength tonight,


1702
01:29:47.036 --> 01:29:49.205
and that includes James.

1703
01:29:49.338 --> 01:29:51.140
You know what else
that means?


1704
01:29:51.274 --> 01:29:53.943
Strike up the band.
Fire up that old grill.


1705
01:29:54.077 --> 01:29:56.512
We're gonna have some great
football action for you to--


1706
01:29:56.645 --> 01:29:59.748
The 13-1 Cougars
against the undefeated Wolves,


1707
01:29:59.882 --> 01:30:01.417
the two best players
in the country...


1708
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:04.120
Or will it?
Even with the rumors


1709
01:30:04.253 --> 01:30:06.255
of a late-night deal
with LeMarcus James,


1710
01:30:06.389 --> 01:30:09.725
many oddsmakers still doubt
he will actually play tonight.


1711
01:30:09.858 --> 01:30:12.528
So the question is,
can James Lazor's Wolves


1712
01:30:12.661 --> 01:30:14.530
win without
their star quarterback?


1713
01:30:14.663 --> 01:30:16.132
I'm not so sure.

1714
01:30:16.265 --> 01:30:19.868
Well, yeah.
He and LeMarcus
have the same mother.


1715
01:30:20.003 --> 01:30:21.804
Yeah, they both grew up
in Virginia.


1716
01:30:21.937 --> 01:30:24.974
Reggie,
he played JUCO football,


1717
01:30:25.108 --> 01:30:26.809
but that fizzled out
after they cut him


1718
01:30:26.942 --> 01:30:28.944
for having
too many concussions.


1719
01:30:29.078 --> 01:30:30.946
I would start
with the state prisons.


1720
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.116
Even try
mental health facilities.


1721
01:30:33.249 --> 01:30:35.351
We need to do
a social media backdoor too.


1722
01:30:35.484 --> 01:30:37.286
I doubt that
he even has an account,


1723
01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:39.655
but we have got to find him.
[knocking]


1724
01:30:40.889 --> 01:30:42.658
He is our pressure point.

1725
01:30:42.791 --> 01:30:45.128
Oh. Coach.

1726
01:30:47.596 --> 01:30:49.165
I got your message.

1727
01:30:53.169 --> 01:30:55.471
This thing
we're toying with,


1728
01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:59.442
it's Pandora's box,
you know?


1729
01:31:00.643 --> 01:31:01.810
I know.

1730
01:31:01.944 --> 01:31:03.479
Nobody gets hurt.

1731
01:31:04.713 --> 01:31:06.182
Nobody goes to jail.

1732
01:31:06.315 --> 01:31:09.318
We just play this game.
That's what we all want.


1733
01:31:17.293 --> 01:31:19.462
[coughing]

1734
01:31:19.595 --> 01:31:21.630
[Emmett] Dear Lord,

1735
01:31:21.764 --> 01:31:24.833
the trees are thick,
and we've yet to see a path
through the wilderness.


1736
01:31:26.369 --> 01:31:28.137
Send us a light.

1737
01:31:28.271 --> 01:31:30.473
Show us the way.
Amen.


1738
01:31:30.606 --> 01:31:32.908
Amen. [coughing]

1739
01:31:35.644 --> 01:31:38.847
I can't believe you've
been here this whole time
and didn't tell us.


1740
01:31:38.981 --> 01:31:41.584
What? You thought I was
gonna miss the show?


1741
01:31:41.717 --> 01:31:43.886
[LeMarcus chuckles quietly]

1742
01:31:44.019 --> 01:31:45.421
I'm sorry.

1743
01:31:45.554 --> 01:31:47.690
No, hey, you don't
owe me anything.


1744
01:31:47.823 --> 01:31:50.193
You're the one, the two of you,
who had the guts and vision--


1745
01:31:50.326 --> 01:31:52.528
I meant about her.

1746
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:55.698
Oh. [inhales sharply]

1747
01:31:55.831 --> 01:31:57.300
Yeah. Her.

1748
01:31:58.301 --> 01:31:59.502
Well...

1749
01:31:59.635 --> 01:32:00.736
[inhales sharply]

1750
01:32:00.869 --> 01:32:02.971
I made my own bed
on that one, so...


1751
01:32:03.106 --> 01:32:05.408
"Thou shalt
not commit adultery"


1752
01:32:05.541 --> 01:32:07.143
is the seventh Commandment.

1753
01:32:10.479 --> 01:32:12.881
Thank you
for clarifying that, Emmett.


1754
01:32:14.016 --> 01:32:15.684
You're welcome.

1755
01:32:15.818 --> 01:32:18.821
[LeMarcus] Look, Elliott,
we can't thank you enough, man.


1756
01:32:18.954 --> 01:32:21.657
Without you, we--
[sighs]


1757
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:24.193
we wouldn't have even had
a shot to pull this off.


1758
01:32:26.028 --> 01:32:27.730
What's going on here?

1759
01:32:29.265 --> 01:32:31.134
Are we about to hold hands

1760
01:32:31.267 --> 01:32:33.369
and feel good
about your little protest?


1761
01:32:33.502 --> 01:32:36.071
'Cause I thought you guys
were in it to win it.


1762
01:32:36.205 --> 01:32:38.073
You know,
as if it were, say,


1763
01:32:38.207 --> 01:32:40.643
the national title.

1764
01:32:46.215 --> 01:32:49.752
Let me give you a little
something I stumbled across
from my travels.


1765
01:32:51.454 --> 01:32:53.956
I believe that's your coach's.

1766
01:32:55.124 --> 01:32:56.925
Wasn't even wrapped
in aluminum.


1767
01:32:57.059 --> 01:32:59.395
Amateur move.

1768
01:33:01.164 --> 01:33:03.966
Yeah, but what's
the point of this?
We can't unlock it.


1769
01:33:05.368 --> 01:33:08.304
Do you need to?
You know what's on it.


1770
01:33:09.772 --> 01:33:13.041
And you're a quarterback.
You know how to bluff
the other team.


1771
01:33:18.847 --> 01:33:20.383
So you're saying
we keep going?


1772
01:33:20.516 --> 01:33:21.984
[Elliott]
That's not my decision.


1773
01:33:22.117 --> 01:33:24.487
It's not even
about which one is right.


1774
01:33:26.389 --> 01:33:29.057
It's about, which one
are you gonna be able
to live with,


1775
01:33:29.192 --> 01:33:31.260
no matter how it goes,

1776
01:33:31.394 --> 01:33:33.529
how much you suffer
the consequences.


1777
01:33:36.632 --> 01:33:40.303
I'm just letting you know
you still have some options.


1778
01:33:40.436 --> 01:33:43.939
[coughing]
It's off to Rome for me,
comrades.


1779
01:33:44.072 --> 01:33:46.975
Wait, you ain't staying
for the game?
Nah, opiate for the masses.


1780
01:33:47.109 --> 01:33:49.712
It's, like,
too much winning
for my taste.


1781
01:33:53.015 --> 01:33:54.850
I'm so proud
of you guys.


1782
01:33:56.652 --> 01:33:58.321
You did this.

1783
01:33:58.454 --> 01:34:00.689
You alone.
And it was...


1784
01:34:03.091 --> 01:34:05.027
It was
fucking magnificent.


1785
01:34:08.397 --> 01:34:10.165
Veni, vidi...

1786
01:34:10.299 --> 01:34:11.667
Vici.
Vici.


1787
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.602
[door closes]
[coughing]


1788
01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:16.205
[LeMarcus] Goddamn.

1789
01:34:16.339 --> 01:34:17.640
Well...

1790
01:34:19.275 --> 01:34:21.444
we're about due
for our surrender.


1791
01:34:22.578 --> 01:34:24.313
What you thinkin'?

1792
01:34:25.113 --> 01:34:26.682
I don't fucking know.

1793
01:34:27.650 --> 01:34:29.151
My head is pounding.

1794
01:34:29.285 --> 01:34:31.720
Where's that doc?

1795
01:34:31.854 --> 01:34:34.723
Yeah, I'll go get him.
He said he'd wait
in the lobby.


1796
01:34:36.058 --> 01:34:37.226
[coughing]

1797
01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:38.994
Damn, you sick.

1798
01:34:39.127 --> 01:34:42.197
See if I can get you
another IV.
I'll be back in ten.


1799
01:34:46.902 --> 01:34:48.371
[door closes]

1800
01:35:53.302 --> 01:35:56.805
[Mike] As soon as
he gets here, we'll have
the coach and him reunite,


1801
01:35:56.939 --> 01:36:00.643
uh, pleasantries, and then
we'll get right to inviting
the media in.


1802
01:36:00.776 --> 01:36:03.278
I'll give them a few minutes.
They'll go off to play.


1803
01:36:03.412 --> 01:36:05.013
[knocking on door]

1804
01:36:05.147 --> 01:36:06.482
Here we go.

1805
01:36:09.051 --> 01:36:10.218
[Everly] Hey!

1806
01:36:10.353 --> 01:36:12.788
LeMarcus has risen.
There he is.


1807
01:36:12.921 --> 01:36:15.458
All right.
Great to see you.


1808
01:36:15.591 --> 01:36:17.593
Can I get you something?
Some water? A Snickers?


1809
01:36:17.726 --> 01:36:19.595
-[laughter]
-I'm good, thanks.


1810
01:36:19.728 --> 01:36:22.164
[Mike] You were a little
under the weather,
but you're better now.


1811
01:36:22.297 --> 01:36:23.932
Yeah.

1812
01:36:24.066 --> 01:36:26.234
[Mike] That's good news.
[Wes] Not for us.


1813
01:36:26.369 --> 01:36:27.670
[laughter]

1814
01:36:27.803 --> 01:36:29.638
[Everly] True.

1815
01:36:29.772 --> 01:36:31.740
[Mike] Um,
I just wanted to, uh,


1816
01:36:31.874 --> 01:36:34.009
get us to have
a little face-to-face


1817
01:36:34.142 --> 01:36:35.778
before we bring
the cameras in here.


1818
01:36:35.911 --> 01:36:37.780
I was just telling
the coach here


1819
01:36:37.913 --> 01:36:40.282
how impressed I was
with, uh, your conduct.


1820
01:36:40.416 --> 01:36:41.650
Very honorable.

1821
01:36:42.751 --> 01:36:44.119
[Coach Lazor] LeMarcus.

1822
01:36:44.252 --> 01:36:46.021
The team is back.

1823
01:36:47.089 --> 01:36:48.891
They heard
about this deal, and...


1824
01:36:49.858 --> 01:36:51.394
everybody else
is playin' this.


1825
01:36:51.527 --> 01:36:52.995
It's just you
and Emmett now.


1826
01:36:53.128 --> 01:36:56.732
These gentlemen are
giving you a committee,


1827
01:36:56.865 --> 01:36:59.835
and they are gonna address
all of your grievances.


1828
01:37:01.136 --> 01:37:02.471
So,

1829
01:37:03.338 --> 01:37:05.708
time to put on
those pads,


1830
01:37:05.841 --> 01:37:07.643
join your brothers,
and do battle.


1831
01:37:08.644 --> 01:37:10.212
Everybody's countin'
on you.


1832
01:37:11.947 --> 01:37:13.882
I'm countin' on you.

1833
01:37:17.319 --> 01:37:19.187
You know, I assure you,
LeMarcus,


1834
01:37:19.321 --> 01:37:21.123
this isn't
a ceremonial committee.


1835
01:37:21.256 --> 01:37:23.358
We're gonna dig down
into these issues


1836
01:37:23.492 --> 01:37:26.395
and figure out
what's best for all of us.


1837
01:37:29.264 --> 01:37:30.866
All right?

1838
01:37:30.999 --> 01:37:33.068
Like the coach said,
we have a game to play.


1839
01:37:33.201 --> 01:37:35.203
Let's get the cameras in...
I didn't say yes.


1840
01:37:36.539 --> 01:37:38.240
[Everly]
What's that?


1841
01:37:39.174 --> 01:37:40.509
I didn't say yes.

1842
01:37:42.845 --> 01:37:44.680
[sighs]

1843
01:37:47.182 --> 01:37:49.084
What would it take
in your mind


1844
01:37:49.985 --> 01:37:51.920
to get to yes?

1845
01:37:54.089 --> 01:37:56.224
Well, our demands
haven't changed.


1846
01:38:00.763 --> 01:38:02.731
[chuckles]

1847
01:38:31.727 --> 01:38:33.629
[Katherine] That's
the sealed case file


1848
01:38:33.762 --> 01:38:36.064
from that fateful night
at the Gin Mill.


1849
01:38:38.834 --> 01:38:42.605
The detectives investigated
for two weeks, and then...


1850
01:38:42.738 --> 01:38:44.172
[sighs]

1851
01:38:44.306 --> 01:38:48.777
...suddenly, K.C. Walton
decided to drop the charges.


1852
01:38:55.117 --> 01:38:58.020
A lot of movin' pieces
in there, LeMarcus.


1853
01:38:58.987 --> 01:39:00.823
This thing is a minefield.

1854
01:39:02.625 --> 01:39:04.927
You find my brother yet?
[Katherine]
Getting close.


1855
01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:09.164
I'd really love
to stop the search
and just have a beer,


1856
01:39:10.298 --> 01:39:12.034
watch a football game.

1857
01:39:15.638 --> 01:39:17.773
Well, why don't
we tell 'em, Coach?


1858
01:39:19.107 --> 01:39:20.643
We're a wolf pack, right?

1859
01:39:22.611 --> 01:39:24.513
We hunt together,
we starve alone.


1860
01:39:24.647 --> 01:39:26.414
Ain't that the creed
you always preach?


1861
01:39:26.549 --> 01:39:29.985
Why don't we tell everybody
how high up this really goes?


1862
01:39:30.118 --> 01:39:32.020
Stop. Just stop.

1863
01:39:32.154 --> 01:39:35.090
Look, you come out
of this now,


1864
01:39:35.223 --> 01:39:37.459
you're not just
a Heisman Trophy winner,


1865
01:39:37.593 --> 01:39:39.528
NFL first-rounder.

1866
01:39:41.096 --> 01:39:44.332
You're an icon now.
You've already
accomplished that.


1867
01:39:44.466 --> 01:39:47.469
You're the Curt Flood
of collegiate athletics.


1868
01:39:48.637 --> 01:39:50.806
You're making
history here already.


1869
01:39:50.939 --> 01:39:52.641
They're gonna write books
about you.


1870
01:39:52.775 --> 01:39:55.077
Now, don't throw
everything away for-for


1871
01:39:55.210 --> 01:39:57.713
whatever this
self-righteous bullshit is.


1872
01:39:57.846 --> 01:39:59.481
Come on, man.
You've worked too hard.


1873
01:39:59.615 --> 01:40:00.849
[grunts softly]

1874
01:40:00.983 --> 01:40:03.318
We've worked too hard
for this.


1875
01:40:04.352 --> 01:40:06.521
Let's just go
fuckin' win this thing.


1876
01:40:08.190 --> 01:40:09.658
[scoffs]

1877
01:40:09.792 --> 01:40:10.826
Win.

1878
01:40:12.695 --> 01:40:14.930
That's all that
really matters, right?


1879
01:40:16.665 --> 01:40:18.133
Just win.

1880
01:40:19.702 --> 01:40:21.637
So that's what I did.

1881
01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:24.039
I won every damn game I could.

1882
01:40:25.473 --> 01:40:27.309
Conference championships,

1883
01:40:27.442 --> 01:40:29.978
Heisman Trophy--
I won and I won and I won.


1884
01:40:30.112 --> 01:40:34.549
Until you were so blind,
you didn't even see the game
I was really playin'.


1885
01:40:34.683 --> 01:40:36.985
You see,
in order to slay Goliath,


1886
01:40:37.119 --> 01:40:39.922
you gotta do it
on the biggest stage
with the brightest lights.


1887
01:40:40.055 --> 01:40:42.490
Millions of people,
an entire system,


1888
01:40:42.625 --> 01:40:45.427
so desperate
for one more win,


1889
01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:47.195
they'd do anything,
give anything.


1890
01:40:47.329 --> 01:40:50.032
No matter how many bodies
you gotta stand on top of.


1891
01:40:51.166 --> 01:40:53.435
And then you got
your professor


1892
01:40:53.568 --> 01:40:55.270
who's fuckin'
the coach's wife...


1893
01:40:57.539 --> 01:40:59.274
to give you
everything you need.


1894
01:41:01.376 --> 01:41:03.111
And you win.

1895
01:41:03.245 --> 01:41:05.480
-You motherfucker!
-[excited chattering]


1896
01:41:05.614 --> 01:41:08.250
You ungrateful bi...
Coach, don't do it.


1897
01:41:08.383 --> 01:41:11.219
Goddamn you,
you fucking ungrateful...


1898
01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:15.390
Jesus fucking Christ,
LeMarcus.


1899
01:41:15.523 --> 01:41:18.460
My wife! My wife!

1900
01:41:22.164 --> 01:41:23.932
[quietly]
Oh, my God.


1901
01:41:29.337 --> 01:41:32.775
Jesus Christ, man.
Everything we've been
through together...


1902
01:41:34.943 --> 01:41:37.079
everything
I've done for you...


1903
01:41:39.748 --> 01:41:42.718
You were a pimply faced
little 16-year-old boy,


1904
01:41:44.086 --> 01:41:46.121
scared to leave home.

1905
01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:50.659
And I looked your mother
in the eyes,


1906
01:41:50.793 --> 01:41:53.862
and I said,
"I will take care
of your boy."


1907
01:41:53.996 --> 01:41:56.164
And that's
what I've done.


1908
01:41:59.334 --> 01:42:01.136
Treated you like my own.

1909
01:42:02.771 --> 01:42:04.606
Like my own son.

1910
01:42:10.012 --> 01:42:11.646
How could you...

1911
01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:13.281
[sighs]

1912
01:42:13.415 --> 01:42:15.283
Goddamn, LeMarcus.

1913
01:42:15.417 --> 01:42:17.452
[breathes shakily] Why?

1914
01:42:22.157 --> 01:42:24.126
For all the ones
to come, Coach.


1915
01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:27.362
The ones
who ain't as fortunate.


1916
01:42:29.131 --> 01:42:31.199
Get this broken system
unbroken.


1917
01:42:33.501 --> 01:42:35.437
So no more of us
get banged up


1918
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:37.706
and forced back
into poverty,


1919
01:42:39.074 --> 01:42:41.109
just like what happened
to Reggie.


1920
01:42:43.979 --> 01:42:47.649
You were the only one
who knew about that file.


1921
01:42:47.783 --> 01:42:50.986
And you stoop even lower,
and you bring Reggie
into this?


1922
01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.422
What, to you he's just...

1923
01:42:54.556 --> 01:42:57.159
he's just some pawn
that you can use against me?


1924
01:42:59.527 --> 01:43:01.163
He was my brother.

1925
01:43:03.999 --> 01:43:05.700
He was a human being.

1926
01:43:09.071 --> 01:43:12.440
Reggie died four months ago
in Tallahassee.


1927
01:43:14.542 --> 01:43:15.844
He took his own life.

1928
01:43:15.978 --> 01:43:18.781
[quietly] Oh, Jesus. Fuck.

1929
01:43:18.914 --> 01:43:21.750
Y'all didn't know.
And what's worse,
y'all don't even care.


1930
01:43:23.852 --> 01:43:25.687
There's always
some new batch of kids


1931
01:43:25.821 --> 01:43:28.556
that get you more wins
and get you more money.


1932
01:43:32.527 --> 01:43:33.862
I am not your son.

1933
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:36.664
I'm a man.

1934
01:43:39.067 --> 01:43:40.568
[sniffles]

1935
01:43:42.504 --> 01:43:43.939
Yeah, you are.

1936
01:43:49.044 --> 01:43:50.678
And I love you.

1937
01:43:55.617 --> 01:43:57.652
But I got
a football game to win.


1938
01:44:01.957 --> 01:44:03.591
[door opens]

1939
01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.394
[door closes]

1940
01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:13.936
[Mike clears throat]
Gentlemen, um,


1941
01:44:14.069 --> 01:44:15.770
would you step out
for a minute?


1942
01:44:16.905 --> 01:44:18.406
Give us some time?

1943
01:44:19.774 --> 01:44:21.109
[sniffles]

1944
01:44:38.894 --> 01:44:42.430
You open up that minefield,
it's gonna be more
than just me and Reggie.


1945
01:44:43.698 --> 01:44:45.300
On Coach's phone,
we got emails


1946
01:44:45.433 --> 01:44:47.569
from prosecutors,
law enforcement.


1947
01:44:47.702 --> 01:44:50.238
All of 'em were involved
in the cover-up.


1948
01:44:50.372 --> 01:44:52.607
Shoot, even the governor

1949
01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:55.143
chest bumps
in the locker room
on game day.


1950
01:44:56.912 --> 01:45:00.382
Coach's phone,
you'll find a text where
he promises to take care of it.


1951
01:45:05.153 --> 01:45:06.521
The martyr.

1952
01:45:07.856 --> 01:45:10.358
Willing to die
for the cause.


1953
01:45:10.492 --> 01:45:13.195
I find that courageous.
Admirable.


1954
01:45:14.596 --> 01:45:17.199
But what about Emmett Sunday?

1955
01:45:18.333 --> 01:45:20.535
You said you were
doing this for him.


1956
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:23.671
Miss Poe?

1957
01:45:35.683 --> 01:45:37.052
[Katherine clears throat]

1958
01:45:37.185 --> 01:45:40.455
"It was chaos.
People everywhere.


1959
01:45:40.588 --> 01:45:43.525
Then all of a sudden,
LeMarcus James,
the quarterback,


1960
01:45:43.658 --> 01:45:46.494
showed up
with someone else.


1961
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:51.666
[clears throat] A big guy.
It was really dangerous.


1962
01:45:51.799 --> 01:45:53.701
Then the big white guy

1963
01:45:55.103 --> 01:45:57.572
flew through the crowd
and hit one guy


1964
01:45:57.705 --> 01:46:00.875
who dropped like he was dead
and threw another guy
into a wall.


1965
01:46:01.009 --> 01:46:04.179
LeMarcus grabbed the man
the crew were beating on,


1966
01:46:04.312 --> 01:46:05.948
and everyone ran.

1967
01:46:07.149 --> 01:46:09.751
Like I said,
it was chaos."
That was self-defense.


1968
01:46:10.852 --> 01:46:12.921
[Mike]
Maybe so. Maybe so.


1969
01:46:13.922 --> 01:46:15.223
But does it matter?

1970
01:46:16.758 --> 01:46:19.227
We go down this road,

1971
01:46:19.361 --> 01:46:21.429
they won't be putting you
on trial,


1972
01:46:21.563 --> 01:46:24.232
they'll be putting
your best friend, Emmett.


1973
01:46:25.367 --> 01:46:28.736
Now, do you have the stomach
to watch the sharks


1974
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:31.006
rip him apart limb by limb

1975
01:46:31.139 --> 01:46:34.542
in front of the whole world
and leave him destroyed,


1976
01:46:34.676 --> 01:46:35.843
canceled?

1977
01:46:37.912 --> 01:46:39.948
LeMarcus,
you're standing toe-to-toe
with the behemoth,


1978
01:46:40.082 --> 01:46:42.084
and we haven't even
begun to fight.


1979
01:46:44.052 --> 01:46:46.288
College football is more
important than you,


1980
01:46:46.421 --> 01:46:48.390
me, Emmett,

1981
01:46:48.523 --> 01:46:50.558
or whatever really is
on that phone.


1982
01:46:52.194 --> 01:46:54.196
The American people

1983
01:46:54.329 --> 01:46:56.631
will let the state
of Missouri
fall under the sea


1984
01:46:56.764 --> 01:46:58.366
rather than give up
Saturday afternoon,


1985
01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:00.202
drunk and roaring
for their alma mater.


1986
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:04.472
We're inevitable
as the rain.


1987
01:47:11.946 --> 01:47:14.182
Now, you gonna put
on that helmet or not?


1988
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:25.360
[crowd cheering]

1989
01:47:28.796 --> 01:47:32.067
[sportscaster on TV] ...gearing
up for the college football
national title game.


1990
01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.901
The fans are buzzing
with excitement...


1991
01:47:34.036 --> 01:47:36.671
[Emmett] "Inevitable"?
Like what?


1992
01:47:38.073 --> 01:47:39.407
The rain.

1993
01:47:41.243 --> 01:47:43.611
"I'm inevitable
as the rain."


1994
01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:48.150
Feels powerful.
Mm-hmm.


1995
01:47:48.283 --> 01:47:49.917
It was.

1996
01:47:54.322 --> 01:47:55.690
[bones popping]

1997
01:47:55.823 --> 01:47:57.592
[sighs]

1998
01:47:57.725 --> 01:48:00.662
Gonna have to drain
the fluid out of this
damn thing again.


1999
01:48:04.432 --> 01:48:06.901
You look better. Lighter.

2000
01:48:07.035 --> 01:48:08.970
Finally breathe
through my nose.


2001
01:48:10.138 --> 01:48:13.341
By the way,
that Doc Holliday head fake,


2002
01:48:13.475 --> 01:48:16.178
you playing like you were
on your deathbed,
was sure good.


2003
01:48:17.112 --> 01:48:18.980
[scoffs]

2004
01:48:19.114 --> 01:48:22.584
Lacked the nuance of Kilmer,
but, uh, I bought it.


2005
01:48:23.551 --> 01:48:25.187
I'll be your Huckleberry.

2006
01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:27.755
[both chuckle]

2007
01:48:34.129 --> 01:48:36.364
You sure they didn't try
to use me against you?


2008
01:48:36.498 --> 01:48:37.699
Nah.

2009
01:48:39.134 --> 01:48:40.802
I swear.

2010
01:48:40.935 --> 01:48:43.037
'Cause if I find out
that you were...


2011
01:48:43.171 --> 01:48:44.739
Trust me.

2012
01:48:44.872 --> 01:48:47.675
They know this fight hurts them
way more than it hurts us.


2013
01:48:47.809 --> 01:48:51.546
All those people involved
in the cover-up,
they ain't doin' shit.


2014
01:48:51.679 --> 01:48:54.882
[Levy] The Superdome
in New Orleans is ready
to explode with excitement.


2015
01:48:55.016 --> 01:48:57.819
Tonight, it's the Snickers
National Title game.


2016
01:48:57.952 --> 01:48:59.687
Hi, everybody,
and good evening.


2017
01:48:59.821 --> 01:49:01.756
I'm Steve Levy,
along with Malcolm Jenkins,


2018
01:49:01.889 --> 01:49:03.358
and this one has
all the makings.


2019
01:49:03.491 --> 01:49:05.059
This could be a classic.
No.


2020
01:49:05.193 --> 01:49:06.594
[Levy] We're talking about
for years to come...


2021
01:49:06.728 --> 01:49:08.963
Leave it.
...for a variety
of reasons.


2022
01:49:09.097 --> 01:49:10.898
A lot of the controversy
still looms


2023
01:49:11.032 --> 01:49:13.101
with LeMarcus James bein'
missin' from the action,


2024
01:49:13.235 --> 01:49:15.870
as he continues his fight
against the NCAA practices,


2025
01:49:16.003 --> 01:49:18.273
a stance that has gone
crazy on social media...
Whoo. Yes, sir.


2026
01:49:18.406 --> 01:49:20.142
...with the viral hashtag,
"Fix the System."


2027
01:49:20.275 --> 01:49:22.310
[Levy] How about
one million tweets


2028
01:49:22.444 --> 01:49:24.479
the last 12 hours alone?

2029
01:49:24.612 --> 01:49:26.948
My sense is,
this is only the beginning.


2030
01:49:27.081 --> 01:49:30.652
How do you think that translates
onto the field the next

2031
01:49:30.785 --> 01:49:32.987
[Jenkins] I think
you'll see these coaches
have these teams prepared.


2032
01:49:33.121 --> 01:49:34.922
These players have worked
so hard to get to this moment,


2033
01:49:35.056 --> 01:49:36.591
that I think
they'll be focused...


2034
01:49:36.724 --> 01:49:38.293
At least we made
some noise, right?


2035
01:49:38.426 --> 01:49:40.295
...knowing that
this is everything...


2036
01:49:40.428 --> 01:49:42.264
Oh, that wasn't just noise.

2037
01:49:43.665 --> 01:49:45.767
The truth is out now
because of us.


2038
01:49:46.934 --> 01:49:48.470
And they can't hide it.

2039
01:49:49.837 --> 01:49:52.440
Now more people are gonna
stand up, a lot more.


2040
01:49:53.541 --> 01:49:56.043
And they'll know
right where to hit 'em.


2041
01:49:57.111 --> 01:49:58.280
Yeah.

2042
01:50:00.182 --> 01:50:01.283
Yeah.

2043
01:50:02.116 --> 01:50:03.451
Hell, yeah.

2044
01:50:03.585 --> 01:50:06.254
Man, we're like the Rebels
in Rogue One.


2045
01:50:08.890 --> 01:50:11.426
We die on the beach,

2046
01:50:11.559 --> 01:50:14.662
but the plans
for the Death Star
make it off the island.


2047
01:50:22.737 --> 01:50:25.006
Nothing is inevitable
except the truth.


2048
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:43.658
* If I go down *

2049
01:50:43.791 --> 01:50:46.261
* Don't let me fall
For nothing *


2050
01:50:46.394 --> 01:50:48.663
* Give me all my time *

2051
01:50:48.796 --> 01:50:51.165
* I want it all
And, honey *


2052
01:50:51.299 --> 01:50:53.668
* I made it out *

2053
01:50:53.801 --> 01:50:55.870
* A hundred miles
I'm running *


2054
01:50:56.003 --> 01:50:58.440
* So if I go down *

2055
01:50:58.573 --> 01:51:01.209
* Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
For nothing *


2056
01:51:01.343 --> 01:51:03.044
* What is your right? *

2057
01:51:03.177 --> 01:51:05.980
* What would it cost to toss
All your morals aside? *


2058
01:51:06.113 --> 01:51:08.983
* Piece of the pie
Something foreign to drop *


2059
01:51:09.116 --> 01:51:10.852
* What would you put
On the line? *


2060
01:51:10.985 --> 01:51:13.521
* They say they can guarantee
All the money you need *


2061
01:51:13.655 --> 01:51:15.657
* If you trade in
Your soul first *


2062
01:51:15.790 --> 01:51:18.860
* When the money and ego
Bring out the evil
In people *


2063
01:51:18.993 --> 01:51:21.863
* What is your soul worth?
Let us pray *


2064
01:51:21.996 --> 01:51:25.400
* Father forgive 'em
'Cause they do not know
What they've done *


2065
01:51:25.533 --> 01:51:27.402
* Came from the bottom
The slums *


2066
01:51:27.535 --> 01:51:29.871
* We got it straight
Out of the mud *


2067
01:51:30.004 --> 01:51:33.341
* Only because the pressure
They tried to put on me
Was never enough *


2068
01:51:33.475 --> 01:51:36.444
* Mama was right
When she called me
A son of a gun *


2069
01:51:36.578 --> 01:51:40.248
* So you'd better duck
May heaven forgive you
For pressing your luck *


2070
01:51:40.382 --> 01:51:41.549
* Hey! *

2071
01:51:50.124 --> 01:51:52.360
* I made it out *

2072
01:51:52.494 --> 01:51:54.696
* A hundred miles
I'm running *


2073
01:51:54.829 --> 01:51:57.265
* So if I go down *

2074
01:51:57.399 --> 01:52:00.868
* Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
For nothing... *
