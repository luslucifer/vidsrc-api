00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:12.091
-This is gonna be rough.
-Yep.


2
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.020
-Hi, Dad.
-Hey, Daniela.


3
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:35.936
I'm rushing to security.
Is everything okay?


4
00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:37.764
Yeah, we're fine.
Just checking in.


5
00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:39.331
-Sorry.
-Are you gonna make it?


6
00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.507
Yeah, I think med-checks
should go quickly.


7
00:01:41.508 --> 00:01:44.031
I meant make it here
before midnight.


8
00:01:44.032 --> 00:01:45.337
You're still in Singapore.

9
00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:48.209
Well, Hawaii is 18 hours behind.

10
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.256
It's just over six hours to Tokyo.
Another six to Honolulu.


11
00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:53.737
So, I'll be there
with plenty of time to spare.


12
00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:56.348
New Year's Eve. One delay...

13
00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.959
Hey, hey.
There won't be any delays.


14
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.309
Hold on.

15
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.180
Hey, sorry. I'm running late
this morning.


16
00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:03.399
I just need to scan your badge,

17
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.530
and we'll get you
through quickly.


18
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:06.403
Thank you.

19
00:02:06.446 --> 00:02:08.578
Now, tell your Aunt Carrie I'm expecting
some homemade haggis,


20
00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.841
neeps, and tatties
waiting for me, all right?


21
00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:13.974
-Okay.
-I'll see you soon.


22
00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:15.454
Hey, Dad.

23
00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:17.369
I'm really glad
that we're doing this.


24
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.416
And I'm sorry that it's taken so long
for us to be together.


25
00:02:20.417 --> 00:02:23.332
Don't apologize.
I know you have a busy life at school.


26
00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:24.898
Yeah, thanks to you.

27
00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.423
That's my job, sweetheart.

28
00:02:27.424 --> 00:02:30.295
I wouldn't have it
any other way.


29
00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:32.576
Well, almost.

30
00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.310
-Captain Torrance?
-Yeah, sorry I'm late.


31
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:47.747
It's fine, sir.
The flight officer hasn't even come by yet.


32
00:02:47.748 --> 00:02:51.098
-Good.
-Oh. Samuel Dele.


33
00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.492
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, nice to meet you.


34
00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:56.495
-Happy New Year.
-And to you.


35
00:02:56.496 --> 00:02:58.932
-Where are you from?
-Uh, Hong Kong, sir.


36
00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:01.021
Did my training at the
Civil Aviation Department.


37
00:03:01.022 --> 00:03:04.851
Oh, yeah.
I hear that's a great academy.


38
00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.941
And you, sir?
English, I'm guessing?


39
00:03:07.942 --> 00:03:11.118
Hell, no.
I wouldn't lower myself.


40
00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.470
-Nope. I'm Scottish.
-Oh.


41
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.909
Although I did fly
RAF Transport years ago.


42
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.695
Back then, all the sexy assignments
went to the English blokes.


43
00:03:22.696 --> 00:03:24.915
I didn't mind, though,
because for me,


44
00:03:24.916 --> 00:03:29.093
the heavies were an easy path
into the airlines.


45
00:03:29.094 --> 00:03:32.488
Well, it looks like they're pushing us
through weather.


46
00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.099
Of course they are.

47
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.058
Gentlemen, let's see.

48
00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.278
One-hundred and nineteen,
fourteen passengers.


49
00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.193
Everything cleared.
Any questions?


50
00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:44.848
Yeah. Looks like we're pushing through
some serious weather.


51
00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.763
It's converging here
over the South China Sea.


52
00:03:46.764 --> 00:03:48.547
We're aware of it.
By the time you get there,


53
00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:51.289
-it should have moved inland.
-What if it sits there and stews?


54
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.467
We can push out east,
come north over Luzon?


55
00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:57.426
That adds an hour
and 18K in fuel.


56
00:03:57.427 --> 00:03:59.515
The flight's nearly empty,
so we need to shorten.


57
00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:01.386
Take it to 37.
You'll clear that weather.


58
00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:03.475
Good flight. Happy New Year.

59
00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.186
Happy New Year.

60
00:04:06.305 --> 00:04:10.526
Do our iPads control the weather
like his does?


61
00:04:10.527 --> 00:04:12.957
There you go.

62
00:04:13.225 --> 00:04:14.530
Hello, gentlemen.

63
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:16.183
My name's Bonnie.
I'll be your chief tonight.


64
00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:18.142
-Oh. Nice to meet you, Bonnie.
-Good to meet you.


65
00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:22.625
Um, Captain,
you're needed in the Jetway.


66
00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:27.316
-Okay.
-See you soon, Cap.


67
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.200
Captain Torrance, Flight Commander.
How can I help you?


68
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:35.159
Fugitive extradition to Toronto.

69
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.943
We'll be with you
as far as Tokyo.


70
00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:41.078
He'll remain in constraints
and be under my constant supervision.


71
00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:42.819
Well, is he dangerous?
What did he do?


72
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.649
Homicide. 15 years ago.

73
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.128
Wasn't expecting that.

74
00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.217
We found him in Bali
under an alias.


75
00:04:50.218 --> 00:04:52.132
And he's been around,
I'll say that.


76
00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:55.484
Yeah, this is a bare flight.
You're gonna attract a lot of attention.


77
00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:57.355
I don't wanna scare
the rest of the passengers.


78
00:04:57.356 --> 00:05:02.447
I'm afraid
you're stuck with us, Captain.


79
00:05:02.448 --> 00:05:04.308
All right.

80
00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.146
Just keep away
from everyone else, please.


81
00:05:06.147 --> 00:05:08.007
Copy that.

82
00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.759
Let's go.

83
00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:27.951
-Did you check the back there?
-Everything is set back there.


84
00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.169
Evening, ladies.

85
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.388
-Evening, Captain.
-Evening. How are you?


86
00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.520
-Ah, Isabella, how are you?
-Hey. Good.


87
00:05:31.521 --> 00:05:32.608
-Yeah.
-Good, good.


88
00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:34.610
-Maria. Pleasure.
-Hi, Maria. Yeah.


89
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:36.437
Brodie Torrance.

90
00:05:36.438 --> 00:05:37.874
We're all ready to get out
of Singapore?


91
00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:40.180
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. Let's go.


92
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:41.879
Okay.

93
00:05:41.922 --> 00:05:44.141
Okay, confirming 14 passengers.

94
00:05:44.142 --> 00:05:46.665
Fourteen passengers.
New Year's light.


95
00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:49.929
I'm sure everybody's seen
our special guest at the back?


96
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.931
-Louis Gaspare, 35B.
-Mmm-hmm.


97
00:05:51.932 --> 00:05:54.064
What did he do?

98
00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:56.022
I'm sure
the less we know, the better.


99
00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:59.460
You know, just keep your interactions with him
to a minimum. That's all.


100
00:05:59.461 --> 00:06:01.462
-All right? Good.
-Yep.


101
00:06:01.463 --> 00:06:02.942
So, we're gonna get
this new year started?


102
00:06:02.943 --> 00:06:04.422
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.


103
00:06:04.423 --> 00:06:05.858
All right. Get 'em on board.
Let's have a good flight.


104
00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:07.730
-Okay.
-Same to you.


105
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:09.035
-How you doing?
-Hi, there.


106
00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:10.559
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.


107
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.951
Yeah, just back there.

108
00:06:11.952 --> 00:06:14.345
-Happy New Year.
-Thanks.


109
00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:15.476
-Hi. Happy New Year.
-Hi.


110
00:06:15.477 --> 00:06:17.522
-Hi. Hi.
-Thank you.


111
00:06:17.523 --> 00:06:19.393
-Hi. Happy New Year.
-I'm not gonna resend it.


112
00:06:19.394 --> 00:06:21.254
-Hi.
-Hi.


113
00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:22.919
They've seen his face.
-Happy New Year.


114
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.270
They've... They've seen it. I...

115
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:28.054
-Gary, I can't make them sign.
-Hi, happy New Year.


116
00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:29.447
-Hey.
-Happy New Year.


117
00:06:29.448 --> 00:06:30.927
-Hey, how are you?
-I can't make them sign.


118
00:06:30.928 --> 00:06:32.842
-How're you doing?
-That's your...


119
00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:35.061
Hello. Happy New Year.

120
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:36.585
-D-F, just right here.
-Hello.


121
00:06:36.586 --> 00:06:39.239
You gotta be kidding me?
How'd you get an upgrade?


122
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.327
Trailmiles.

123
00:06:40.328 --> 00:06:42.547
I've gotta sit
on my own, in coach.


124
00:06:42.548 --> 00:06:43.809
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.


125
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.594
They should tell you
when you buy your ticket


126
00:06:45.595 --> 00:06:48.118
-how old the plane will be.
-No kidding.


127
00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:49.641
Oh, no need to worry, folks.

128
00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.774
These planes
are pretty much indestructible.


129
00:06:51.775 --> 00:06:52.992
Hey, girls.
Happy New Year.


130
00:06:52.993 --> 00:06:55.212
-Hi.
-Hi, hi.


131
00:06:55.213 --> 00:06:57.213
-Hey.
-Hi.


132
00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:01.044
-I think that's everybody.
-Yeah. Good.


133
00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:03.873
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.


134
00:07:03.874 --> 00:07:05.701
Excuse me, ladies.
That's far enough.


135
00:07:05.702 --> 00:07:07.659
But these are our seats.

136
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.313
I'm in 34D.

137
00:07:09.314 --> 00:07:12.185
It's fine, ladies.
That row there is all yours.


138
00:07:12.186 --> 00:07:13.196
Okay.

139
00:07:13.231 --> 00:07:14.361
Do you wanna sit by the window?

140
00:07:14.362 --> 00:07:16.642
Yeah, thanks.

141
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.118
-Ma'am, can I help you?
-Oh, thank you.


142
00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.293
Ladies and gentlemen,

143
00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:34.599
-make sure your seats...
-Excuse me.


144
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.861
-...are in an upright position...
-Thanks.


145
00:07:35.862 --> 00:07:37.341
...that your seatbelts
are fully fastened


146
00:07:37.342 --> 00:07:39.822
and any carry-on items
you have are fully stowed.


147
00:07:39.823 --> 00:07:43.129
Once again, thank you
for flying Trailblazer.


148
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.262
-Set to max.
-Takeoff trail.


149
00:07:45.263 --> 00:07:46.698
Trim set for takeoff.

150
00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:47.917
And flight controls.

151
00:07:47.918 --> 00:07:49.962
Flight controls, free and clear.

152
00:07:49.963 --> 00:07:51.050
Check is complete.

153
00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:52.399
Passengers
all tucked in, Captain.


154
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.450
All right, let's close it up.
Thanks, Bonnie.


155
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:00.625
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.


156
00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:02.975
Welcome to Trailblazer
flight 119.


157
00:08:02.976 --> 00:08:04.934
This is your captain speaking.

158
00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:08.938
If your next stop is Tokyo,
then you're in the right place.


159
00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:11.331
If you're not going to Tokyo,

160
00:08:11.332 --> 00:08:13.725
then you're about to have
a really long morning.


161
00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.466
-Flight time this evening

162
00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:17.381
is six hours
and thirty minutes.


163
00:08:17.382 --> 00:08:21.559
And luckily, I know a shortcut,
so we might be there a little early.


164
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.648
We'll be taking off
just as soon as I learn


165
00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:30.002
a few pages of this flight manual.
Thank you.


166
00:08:30.003 --> 00:08:31.438
Ready for pushback?

167
00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:33.789
-Ready for pushback.
-Make the call.


168
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.660
-No point to stress about it.
-That's true...


169
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.270
Trailblazer 119,

170
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:39.708
you're clear to taxi
Runway Zero-Two Left.


171
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:41.797
Trailblazer 119,
roger that.


172
00:08:41.798 --> 00:08:46.768
Taxiing Runway Zero
-Two Left.

173
00:08:51.546 --> 00:08:56.681
This is one view
that never gets old.


174
00:08:56.682 --> 00:08:58.727
Trailblazer 119 in position,
ready for takeoff.


175
00:08:58.728 --> 00:09:00.554
Trailblazer 119,

176
00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:02.165
you are cleared for takeoff.

177
00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:04.776
Maintain runway heading,
climb two and maintain 2,000.


178
00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:06.778
Roger that,
and cleared for takeoff.


179
00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:07.910
Fly runway heading.

180
00:09:07.911 --> 00:09:10.695
Climb and maintain 2,000.
Trailblazer 119.


181
00:09:10.696 --> 00:09:15.265
Takeoff power is set.
Airspeed alive.


182
00:09:15.266 --> 00:09:18.572
Eighty. Cross-checks.

183
00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:21.881
90, 100, 110,

184
00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:24.928
120, V-one.

185
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.610
Rotate.

186
00:09:35.373 --> 00:09:38.157
-Positive rate, landing gear up.
-Landing gear up.


187
00:09:38.158 --> 00:09:39.724
-Flaps up.
-Flaps up.


188
00:09:39.725 --> 00:09:41.595
Trailblazer 119, turn right,

189
00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:43.554
heading one-oh-six,
zero degrees.


190
00:09:43.555 --> 00:09:45.599
One-two and maintain
one-zero thousand.


191
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.980
Copy departure.
Trailblazer 119.


192
00:09:52.172 --> 00:09:53.520
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:55.174
this is your captain speaking.

194
00:09:55.175 --> 00:09:57.873
We've reached our cruising altitude
of 37,000 feet.


195
00:09:57.874 --> 00:09:59.004
If there's anything you need...

196
00:09:59.005 --> 00:10:00.397
Sir, would you care
for some almonds?


197
00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:02.007
...please don't
hesitate to ask.


198
00:10:02.008 --> 00:10:03.530
We at Trailblazer

199
00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:05.576
appreciate you spending
your New Year's Day with us.


200
00:10:05.577 --> 00:10:07.186
Thank you.

201
00:10:07.187 --> 00:10:09.536
Hey, do you want
to take a picture with him?


202
00:10:09.537 --> 00:10:11.625
-What?
-A picture.


203
00:10:11.626 --> 00:10:13.206
Come on.

204
00:10:17.981 --> 00:10:23.521
-Could you not do that?
-Sorry.


205
00:10:28.905 --> 00:10:31.297
Beautiful family.

206
00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:34.428
Thank you. Just...

207
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.302
It's a juggle.

208
00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:38.043
But we make it work.

209
00:10:38.044 --> 00:10:39.784
How about you, Cap?

210
00:10:39.785 --> 00:10:43.048
-Do you have a family?
-Yeah, I have a daughter.


211
00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:47.661
Actually, here. Here she is.

212
00:10:47.662 --> 00:10:49.092
Daniela.

213
00:10:50.709 --> 00:10:51.840
I see the resemblance.

214
00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:54.104
You think?

215
00:10:54.147 --> 00:10:57.454
-And where's home?
-Daniela goes to college in California.


216
00:10:57.455 --> 00:11:02.589
And, uh, I'm based
out of Singapore.


217
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.551
The distance must be quite challenging
for you and your wife, no?


218
00:11:07.552 --> 00:11:13.687
Well, my wife actually passed
three years ago.


219
00:11:13.688 --> 00:11:16.038
-I'm so sorry, Captain.
-No, no.


220
00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:20.739
Thank you. Nah, it's okay.

221
00:11:41.847 --> 00:11:43.848
-Happy New Year.
-Oh, thank you.


222
00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:44.893
What can I
get for you, sir?


223
00:11:44.894 --> 00:11:45.981
Uh, gin.

224
00:11:45.982 --> 00:11:47.852
Do you need any tonic
or soda water?


225
00:11:47.853 --> 00:11:51.983
Just gin. Just the gin.

226
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:09.395
We're cutting right through
the top of the storm.


227
00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:12.616
So much for "moving inland."

228
00:12:12.617 --> 00:12:14.705
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.


229
00:12:14.706 --> 00:12:16.663
The seatbelt signs
have been turned on.


230
00:12:16.664 --> 00:12:23.670
Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts secure.
Thank you.


231
00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:30.939
Trailblazer 119, requesting climb
to 40,000 to clear weather.


232
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.899
TSN control, this is Trailblazer 119
requesting flight climb


233
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.296
to 40,000 feet
to clear weather. Copy?


234
00:12:40.297 --> 00:12:42.298
Comms here are not so good.

235
00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:45.823
TCAS is clear of traffic.

236
00:12:45.824 --> 00:12:48.478
TSN control,
this is Trailblazer 119.


237
00:12:48.479 --> 00:12:57.419
Climbing to 40,000
to clear weather, in the blind.


238
00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:07.976
Trailblazer 119, clear to 40,000.

239
00:13:07.977 --> 00:13:13.242
Copy, TSN. Trailblazer 119
level at 40,000.


240
00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:17.093
New Year's crew, huh?

241
00:13:19.162 --> 00:13:20.946
-Whoa.

242
00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:26.998
What was that?

243
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.910
Okay.

244
00:13:28.954 --> 00:13:30.911
I'm gonna check
on the passengers.


245
00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:37.012
-You have control.
-I have control.


246
00:13:37.136 --> 00:13:38.702
Nothing to worry about, folks.

247
00:13:38.703 --> 00:13:41.444
Just some weather.

248
00:13:41.445 --> 00:13:45.970
-Here, Bonnie. You okay?
-Oh. Yes.


249
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:48.277
-What was that?

250
00:13:48.278 --> 00:13:51.106
Sorry, folks. Just going
through some weather.


251
00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:52.890
Is this yours?

252
00:13:52.891 --> 00:13:55.023
-That's mine.
-Oh. Here you go.


253
00:13:55.024 --> 00:13:56.589
Thank you.

254
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.939
He's great with the jokes,
but can he fly the damn plane?


255
00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.203
We're doing
the best we can, sir.


256
00:14:01.204 --> 00:14:04.293
Hey, can I at least get a towel?

257
00:14:04.294 --> 00:14:08.601
We'll get you one
just as soon as we can.


258
00:14:08.602 --> 00:14:09.950
What happened? Are you okay?

259
00:14:09.951 --> 00:14:11.561
Oh. All good.
Just a scratch.


260
00:14:11.562 --> 00:14:13.422
All right.

261
00:14:13.738 --> 00:14:15.130
Listen, keep everybody
in their seats.


262
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:19.391
No exceptions. All right?

263
00:14:36.152 --> 00:14:37.456
Strap 'em in tight.

264
00:14:37.457 --> 00:14:38.805
Yes, sir.

265
00:14:38.806 --> 00:14:41.112
Bonnie,
stay in your seat.


266
00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:44.103
What's happening?

267
00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:48.796
Captain,
avionics are down.


268
00:14:53.995 --> 00:14:56.693
-I have control.
-Copy that.


269
00:14:56.694 --> 00:15:00.566
-Check breakers and reset.
-Resetting.


270
00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:05.876
TSN, this is Trailblazer 119.
Do you copy?


271
00:15:05.877 --> 00:15:09.836
-Unresponsive. 
There's no power.

272
00:15:09.837 --> 00:15:13.579
Avionics must be fried. Shit.

273
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.060
Is anyone on this channel?
Please respond.


274
00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:18.280
Trailblazer 119, flying blind.

275
00:15:18.281 --> 00:15:22.197
Lightning strike.
Avionics down. We are dark.


276
00:15:22.198 --> 00:15:26.114
Does anyone have our position?

277
00:15:26.115 --> 00:15:30.375
Radio is dead. Resetting.

278
00:15:32.556 --> 00:15:34.078
System failure.

279
00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:36.602
We're not transmitting.

280
00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:39.518
We're on straight battery.

281
00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:42.608
That gives us 10 minutes to put her down
before we lose power


282
00:15:42.609 --> 00:15:48.559
and drop into
uncontrolled descent.


283
00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:53.097
-Stopwatch.

284
00:15:53.098 --> 00:15:54.404
What?

285
00:15:54.447 --> 00:15:55.969
Call it out, Dele.

286
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.103
One minute at a time, okay?

287
00:15:59.104 --> 00:16:01.366
-Okay?
-Okay.


288
00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:08.027
Okay. Manual nav.
Last marked position?


289
00:16:09.332 --> 00:16:12.508
427, south southwest of Manila,

290
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:14.466
heading zero-three-zero.

291
00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:17.252
Given speed and heading,

292
00:16:17.253 --> 00:16:21.169
we should be about here.

293
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.301
The storm's heading northeast.

294
00:16:23.302 --> 00:16:27.152
We won't make Manila.

295
00:16:27.263 --> 00:16:29.089
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.

296
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.572
This is Trailblazer 119.
Descending from 40,000 feet.


297
00:16:33.573 --> 00:16:39.187
No radar, no navigation,
no antenna, no ADI.


298
00:16:39.188 --> 00:16:41.748
Please respond.

299
00:16:42.016 --> 00:16:43.278
Oh, my God.

300
00:16:43.279 --> 00:16:45.149
Avionics are fried, Bonnie.

301
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.717
It's about to get very rough.

302
00:16:47.718 --> 00:16:50.708
Okay, okay, okay.

303
00:16:54.812 --> 00:16:56.160
This is not happening.

304
00:16:56.161 --> 00:17:02.121
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've had...


305
00:17:02.646 --> 00:17:06.257
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've had an electrical malfunction


306
00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:10.218
and I need everyone to have
their seatbelts securely fastened!


307
00:17:10.219 --> 00:17:12.698
We're gonna be forced to fly through
some severe weather!


308
00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.309
-What happened?
-An electrical malfunction!


309
00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:21.620
I need everyone's seatbelts
to be fully fastened!


310
00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:23.051
Captain.

311
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.328
-Time?
-Eight minutes.


312
00:17:33.329 --> 00:17:37.027
We're gonna lose the moon.
Keep your eyes on the gyro.


313
00:17:37.028 --> 00:17:38.463
Call it out.

314
00:17:38.464 --> 00:17:47.254
Get ready to take the controls
if anything happens.


315
00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.348
That's hail.

316
00:17:53.349 --> 00:17:55.611
Now it's a party.

317
00:17:55.612 --> 00:17:58.396
Shit. We gotta
punch through this storm


318
00:17:58.397 --> 00:18:03.097
and see where we come out.

319
00:18:14.892 --> 00:18:18.199
-My phone.

320
00:18:18.243 --> 00:18:21.637
-It's not going through.
-Neither is mine.


321
00:18:21.638 --> 00:18:24.857
Come on, baby.
Hold tight. Hold tight.


322
00:18:24.858 --> 00:18:27.817
Oh, my God. Help!

323
00:18:27.818 --> 00:18:32.430
Can you take off the cuffs?
I can't swim.


324
00:18:32.431 --> 00:18:34.861
Not a chance.

325
00:18:40.874 --> 00:18:43.398
Go ahead, go ahead.
I got you. I got you.


326
00:18:43.399 --> 00:18:49.499
The goddamn plane
is falling apart!


327
00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:52.756
Shit!

328
00:18:56.934 --> 00:19:01.241
-Sir, you must take your seat.
-Sir? Sir? Sit down.


329
00:19:01.242 --> 00:19:03.069
Stay here. Stay here,
Isabella. Just stay.


330
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.288
-Just stay seated.
-Sit down!


331
00:19:04.289 --> 00:19:08.129
-Sit down!
-Sit down!


332
00:19:08.989 --> 00:19:10.699
-Isabella!

333
00:19:12.253 --> 00:19:14.403
Oh, my God!

334
00:19:15.213 --> 00:19:16.257
Whoa.

335
00:19:16.301 --> 00:19:19.721
Could you help her?

336
00:19:19.913 --> 00:19:21.219
Time?

337
00:19:21.262 --> 00:19:26.512
Five minutes and forty seconds.

338
00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:32.969
Come on.
Come on, break through.


339
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.690
Oh, fuck.

340
00:19:53.469 --> 00:19:55.899
There you go.

341
00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:00.954
Time?

342
00:20:00.998 --> 00:20:03.042
Four minutes
and thirty seconds.


343
00:20:03.043 --> 00:20:04.053
Okay.

344
00:20:04.915 --> 00:20:09.465
Can you see land anywhere?

345
00:20:15.012 --> 00:20:18.014
Please, sir, sit down.

346
00:20:18.015 --> 00:20:24.395
Everyone stay
in their seats, please.


347
00:20:32.508 --> 00:20:39.318
Captain, what do I tell
the passengers?


348
00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:49.109
Never thought
I would ever have to say this.


349
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.340
Prepare to ditch.

350
00:20:54.617 --> 00:20:55.661
Okay.

351
00:21:00.753 --> 00:21:02.667
Attention, everyone!

352
00:21:02.668 --> 00:21:05.365
I need you to brace for impact!

353
00:21:05.366 --> 00:21:07.846
The plane is equipped
with flotation devices.


354
00:21:07.847 --> 00:21:09.587
-We're gonna crash.
-And once we are down,


355
00:21:09.588 --> 00:21:11.807
I will give you
further instruction!


356
00:21:11.808 --> 00:21:13.286
-Maria, do you hear me?
-Where are we landing?


357
00:21:13.287 --> 00:21:19.107
Yes, copy that!
Brace for impact!


358
00:21:20.077 --> 00:21:25.342
Those white caps
don't look too welcoming.


359
00:21:25.343 --> 00:21:26.353
Time?

360
00:21:28.215 --> 00:21:30.635
Three minutes.

361
00:21:53.806 --> 00:21:59.115
All right, Dele.
Let's give this our best shot.


362
00:21:59.116 --> 00:22:01.596
On my command,
we're gonna turn into the wind


363
00:22:01.597 --> 00:22:04.120
and we're gonna come in
parallel to the swells,


364
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:07.993
so we touch down slow and level.

365
00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:09.474
Okay?

366
00:22:16.699 --> 00:22:20.440
You see that? Over there?

367
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:24.001
That's fucking land.

368
00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:36.587
Feet dry.
Any clue where we are?


369
00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:40.852
We should be somewhere
around here.


370
00:22:40.853 --> 00:22:42.245
Too low terrain.

371
00:22:42.246 --> 00:22:44.073
-Too low terrain.

372
00:22:44.074 --> 00:22:47.774
That's still working.

373
00:22:48.034 --> 00:22:51.444
Captain, 90 seconds.

374
00:22:52.865 --> 00:22:56.575
She'll give us more.

375
00:23:04.703 --> 00:23:06.530
What's going on?

376
00:23:06.531 --> 00:23:09.707
We can't be landing here.

377
00:23:09.708 --> 00:23:12.268
Twenty seconds.

378
00:23:13.277 --> 00:23:20.097
We might be better off
over the water.


379
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:25.751
Out of time.

380
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.990
There!

381
00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:35.559
That's a road. Time?

382
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.213
Ten seconds past zero.
Are you...


383
00:23:37.214 --> 00:23:41.204
That's a fucking road.

384
00:23:43.568 --> 00:23:45.438
-Flaps full.
-Flaps full.


385
00:23:45.439 --> 00:23:47.859
Fuel jettison.

386
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:51.706
Visually confirming fuel dump,
my side.


387
00:23:51.707 --> 00:23:53.098
Nothing here.

388
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:58.538
Right side failure.
Trying again.


389
00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:01.367
-Negative.
-Fuck.


390
00:24:01.368 --> 00:24:04.283
We're a stick of dynamite.

391
00:24:04.284 --> 00:24:08.964
Manually extend gear. Hurry.

392
00:24:09.942 --> 00:24:11.377
Landing gear extended
and locked.


393
00:24:11.378 --> 00:24:15.498
-Low terrain.
-Shut up.


394
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:20.952
No. No.

395
00:24:20.953 --> 00:24:22.171
Speed brakes extended.

396
00:24:22.172 --> 00:24:26.218
Reverse full thrust.
Reverse full thrust.


397
00:24:26.219 --> 00:24:33.179
-Help me with the brakes, Dele.
-On it.


398
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.520
Okay.

399
00:24:59.122 --> 00:25:01.822
-Everything off.

400
00:25:04.693 --> 00:25:08.393
How... How did you...

401
00:25:11.482 --> 00:25:13.570
One minute at a time.

402
00:25:13.571 --> 00:25:15.851
-Right, Dele?

403
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.012
Fuck.

404
00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:25.887
Hell, we still got fuel.

405
00:25:25.888 --> 00:25:27.671
And a hot plane.

406
00:25:27.672 --> 00:25:30.021
Let's get everyone off now.
Let's go.


407
00:25:30.022 --> 00:25:31.370
Dele,
get everybody in the front.


408
00:25:31.371 --> 00:25:33.285
Get me the hell off
this damn plane.


409
00:25:33.286 --> 00:25:34.417
Everybody okay?

410
00:25:34.418 --> 00:25:36.549
Quiet, please.
Everybody, listen up!


411
00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.074
I need everybody
off the plane now!


412
00:25:39.075 --> 00:25:40.640
Which way are we going?

413
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:43.818
Everybody, quiet.
Go to the front. Go to the front.


414
00:25:43.819 --> 00:25:48.953
I need you all
off this plane now!


415
00:25:48.954 --> 00:25:52.261
I just wanna know what...

416
00:25:52.262 --> 00:25:54.002
-Don't worry about your stuff.
-You need to breathe.


417
00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:55.351
Get moved to the front.

418
00:25:55.352 --> 00:25:56.395
Okay, just breathe.

419
00:25:56.396 --> 00:25:58.746
-Bonnie?
-Two!


420
00:25:58.747 --> 00:26:01.357
We have two. Sir, two.

421
00:26:01.358 --> 00:26:03.707
-Okay, just go.
-Okay, come on. Move, move.


422
00:26:03.708 --> 00:26:06.144
Let's calmly exit the plane.

423
00:26:06.145 --> 00:26:08.494
Everybody, stay calm.
Let me through.


424
00:26:08.495 --> 00:26:10.235
-Hurry, Bonnie.
-Oh, yes.


425
00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:12.150
In a single line,
come on through. Come on.


426
00:26:12.151 --> 00:26:16.561
Be calm!
Go! Move, move.


427
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:25.990
Please move to the side.
Please move to the side.


428
00:26:29.299 --> 00:26:34.085
Okay, sit down.
Fold your arms, like this.


429
00:26:34.086 --> 00:26:38.066
Arms crossed, sit down.

430
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.330
-Flight 119.
-Uh, I'll call you.


431
00:27:01.331 --> 00:27:03.071
What do we know, Sydney?

432
00:27:03.072 --> 00:27:06.465
Well, sir, we lost it somewhere
west of the Philippines.


433
00:27:06.466 --> 00:27:08.946
-Lost?
-The plane requested a higher altitude


434
00:27:08.947 --> 00:27:10.643
at 5:16 a.m. local.

435
00:27:10.644 --> 00:27:14.082
Nineteen minutes, 23 seconds later,
all communication stopped.


436
00:27:14.083 --> 00:27:18.129
Manila ATC had them on radar
until 5:43 a.m. local


437
00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.916
when the plane dipped
below 20,000 feet and lost all contact.


438
00:27:21.917 --> 00:27:23.918
Get me David Scarsdale,
right now.


439
00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:25.745
Um, we have some cuts
and bruises,


440
00:27:25.746 --> 00:27:28.096
but, um, I think everyone's
just pretty rattled.


441
00:27:28.097 --> 00:27:29.619
Anyone have cell service?

442
00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.770
No. No one.

443
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.884
What do we do
about the prisoner?


444
00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:36.669
I don't know.
That's a new one for me.


445
00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.455
Um...

446
00:27:38.498 --> 00:27:42.414
I saw him eyeing the officer's keys,
so I took them.


447
00:27:42.415 --> 00:27:45.265
Is he dangerous?

448
00:27:47.072 --> 00:27:49.944
He's being extradited
on a murder charge.


449
00:27:49.945 --> 00:27:52.120
The officer...

450
00:27:52.121 --> 00:27:56.211
The officer said, yeah,
he might be dangerous.


451
00:27:56.212 --> 00:27:58.213
Look, we just keep an eye on him

452
00:27:58.214 --> 00:28:02.260
and keep him separate
from the other passengers, okay?


453
00:28:02.261 --> 00:28:03.435
Just try your best.

454
00:28:03.436 --> 00:28:04.872
-Okay.
-All right.


455
00:28:04.873 --> 00:28:09.137
Here. I think
you should hold on to these.


456
00:28:09.138 --> 00:28:10.747
-Okay. Let's go.
-Okay.


457
00:28:10.748 --> 00:28:12.748
Yeah, okay.

458
00:28:13.011 --> 00:28:16.231
Water... Just nowhere.

459
00:28:16.232 --> 00:28:18.146
-What's going on?
-Tell us something.


460
00:28:18.147 --> 00:28:19.843
Yeah.
We need information.


461
00:28:19.844 --> 00:28:21.714
Can we please
get some real answers?


462
00:28:21.715 --> 00:28:24.108
-There's gotta be some thing...
-Okay, everybody...


463
00:28:24.109 --> 00:28:27.198
Everybody... Listen, listen up.

464
00:28:27.199 --> 00:28:29.984
I want to thank you all
for your cooperation.


465
00:28:29.985 --> 00:28:31.420
I'm sorry for what
we just had to go through,


466
00:28:31.421 --> 00:28:33.030
and I know
you all have questions.


467
00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:34.205
-Yeah.
-Yeah.


468
00:28:34.206 --> 00:28:37.034
So, here's the situation.

469
00:28:37.035 --> 00:28:38.993
We got hit by lightning

470
00:28:38.994 --> 00:28:41.996
and our main power
and comms are down.


471
00:28:41.997 --> 00:28:44.259
Okay, so, as of now,

472
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.782
there's no way
of calling for help.


473
00:28:45.783 --> 00:28:48.611
-What? You're kidding.
-No way? No way?


474
00:28:48.612 --> 00:28:51.309
What I need everybody
to do right now, listen up...


475
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.964
-How come?
-...is remain calm.


476
00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:56.010
All right? Once the plane
cools down,


477
00:28:56.011 --> 00:28:58.664
we're gonna get back on there,
we're gonna get our things,


478
00:28:58.665 --> 00:29:00.231
get some water

479
00:29:00.232 --> 00:29:01.885
and we're gonna figure out
what we're gonna do.


480
00:29:01.886 --> 00:29:03.365
Do you know where we are?

481
00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:06.368
Yeah, we think
that we're near Davao


482
00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:08.631
in the southern Philippines.

483
00:29:08.632 --> 00:29:10.285
-You think?
-We think.


484
00:29:10.286 --> 00:29:12.852
-Very reassuring.
-Rest assured,


485
00:29:12.853 --> 00:29:15.551
me and the crew are gonna do
everything we can to make sure


486
00:29:15.552 --> 00:29:17.988
that we get you
out of here safely.


487
00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:20.512
All right? Okay. Thank you.

488
00:29:20.513 --> 00:29:23.083
Okay, come on.

489
00:29:24.343 --> 00:29:25.909
-Hey, Terry.
-Hey.


490
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:27.693
Everyone,
this is David Scarsdale.


491
00:29:27.694 --> 00:29:30.958
He specializes in corporate strategy
and crisis management.


492
00:29:30.959 --> 00:29:33.351
-Happy New Year.
-Let's hope so.


493
00:29:33.352 --> 00:29:34.918
Is this
the last point of contact?


494
00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:36.006
Yes, it is.

495
00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:37.399
That's a hell of a storm.

496
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.096
What idiot sent them
flying through that?


497
00:29:39.097 --> 00:29:40.924
It's airline protocol.

498
00:29:40.925 --> 00:29:43.057
Flight was light.
It was the most efficient route.


499
00:29:43.058 --> 00:29:44.797
I thought
they could fly above it.


500
00:29:44.798 --> 00:29:47.670
You thought? What, are you
a fucking meteorologist, too?


501
00:29:47.671 --> 00:29:48.976
How much fuel did you save?

502
00:29:48.977 --> 00:29:50.716
About $12,000.

503
00:29:50.717 --> 00:29:53.589
Well, congratulations. That's
barely tip money on this deal.


504
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.113
The clock is ticking.
Every minute matters.


505
00:29:56.114 --> 00:29:58.594
If that plane ditched at sea,
or crash landed,


506
00:29:58.595 --> 00:30:01.858
we can count those minutes
in lives lost or saved. Got it?


507
00:30:01.859 --> 00:30:04.948
Okay, so, what can I do?
Call the military? US assets?


508
00:30:04.949 --> 00:30:06.167
What are your best options?

509
00:30:06.168 --> 00:30:08.169
Well, in that part of the world,

510
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.127
there's only one option
right now.


511
00:30:10.128 --> 00:30:11.302
What's that?

512
00:30:11.303 --> 00:30:12.521
You're gonna want
the lawyers out of here.


513
00:30:12.522 --> 00:30:15.132
It's fine. Tell me.

514
00:30:15.133 --> 00:30:17.482
Private assets.
I'm already into it.


515
00:30:17.483 --> 00:30:20.007
-Mercenaries?
-Terry...


516
00:30:20.008 --> 00:30:22.139
The Philippines
are not the Amalfi Coast.


517
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.924
Now, I need a group working
on press releases


518
00:30:24.925 --> 00:30:27.188
for every possible scenario.

519
00:30:27.189 --> 00:30:29.538
A ghosting like Malaysia 370.

520
00:30:29.539 --> 00:30:32.106
A crash landing
with no survivors.


521
00:30:32.107 --> 00:30:33.933
A hijacking with demands.

522
00:30:33.934 --> 00:30:36.719
If you have plans for New Year's Eve,
I just canceled them.


523
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.113
A little further.
Yeah, right to the end.


524
00:30:39.114 --> 00:30:41.506
-Tight as we can.
-Yeah.


525
00:30:41.507 --> 00:30:43.595
Why can't we just stay inside
the plane?


526
00:30:43.596 --> 00:30:46.468
-It's safe and dry.

527
00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:48.905
Well, that's a good question,
Mister, uh...


528
00:30:48.906 --> 00:30:51.168
Sinclair. Matt Sinclair.

529
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:54.128
Well, without air conditioning,

530
00:30:54.129 --> 00:30:57.653
that plane
is gonna cook in the sun.


531
00:30:57.654 --> 00:31:02.440
So, we're better off out here,
with the shelter and a breeze.


532
00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:05.139
Hey, while you're there,
you wanna step in,


533
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.316
help secure that, 
Matt Sinclair?

534
00:31:08.317 --> 00:31:10.622
Okay, if you're in your bags,
you find anything like,


535
00:31:10.623 --> 00:31:13.451
uh, bug spray, sunscreen,

536
00:31:13.452 --> 00:31:18.562
food, please share. All right?

537
00:31:19.937 --> 00:31:22.077
Mr. Gaspare.

538
00:31:28.772 --> 00:31:30.062
Well...

539
00:31:31.383 --> 00:31:38.085
Looks like we've got ourselves
in a bit of a mess here.


540
00:31:38.086 --> 00:31:39.957
And so,

541
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.177
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed
to do with you.


542
00:31:43.178 --> 00:31:47.094
To be honest, I'm a bit surprised
you're still here.


543
00:31:47.095 --> 00:31:48.965
You think I'm fucking
stupid enough to try and escape


544
00:31:48.966 --> 00:31:51.750
in a jungle I don't know?

545
00:31:51.751 --> 00:31:54.031
In handcuffs?

546
00:31:54.102 --> 00:31:58.061
Unless you're offering.

547
00:31:58.062 --> 00:32:01.586
I don't think I can do that.

548
00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:07.837
Then we have
nothing to talk about.


549
00:32:14.209 --> 00:32:15.340
Shit.

550
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.562
This is what happens
when a 40-amp fuse


551
00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:23.608
gets hit with enough juice
to light a city.


552
00:32:23.609 --> 00:32:26.889
Check it out, man.

553
00:32:28.397 --> 00:32:32.097
What about the radio?

554
00:32:32.401 --> 00:32:35.838
Let's see here. Oh, no.

555
00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:37.535
It's fried, melted.

556
00:32:37.536 --> 00:32:40.843
And the transponder?

557
00:32:40.844 --> 00:32:47.384
It's hard to tell
without the power.


558
00:32:48.243 --> 00:32:51.680
If we could reroute
the isolation bus


559
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:54.248
to the essential bus,

560
00:32:54.249 --> 00:32:57.642
we could draw down more amps
from the battery.


561
00:32:57.643 --> 00:32:59.503
In theory.

562
00:33:00.298 --> 00:33:03.082
Captain,
plane's fully unloaded


563
00:33:03.083 --> 00:33:10.133
except for the, uh,
bodies and their personals.


564
00:33:10.134 --> 00:33:12.440
-I'll handle it.
-Okay.


565
00:33:12.441 --> 00:33:14.572
-Hey, Bonnie.
-Yeah?


566
00:33:14.573 --> 00:33:18.123
Sorry about Isabella.

567
00:35:15.781 --> 00:35:18.130
-What are you doing, man?
-You know what they say.


568
00:35:18.131 --> 00:35:22.396
No video, didn't happen.

569
00:35:22.397 --> 00:35:27.009
Here we all are.
Alone, in the jungle.


570
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:30.795
No idea of how
we're gonna get out.


571
00:35:30.796 --> 00:35:33.232
Survivors of the worst
fucking plane ride


572
00:35:33.233 --> 00:35:35.365
in the history
of bad plane rides.


573
00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:39.456
There's our lovely plane that decided
to fall out of the sky.


574
00:35:39.457 --> 00:35:43.330
Trailblazer.
Never flying this again.


575
00:35:43.331 --> 00:35:46.898
There's our snacks.
They're gonna last us


576
00:35:46.899 --> 00:35:48.160
about an hour.

577
00:35:48.161 --> 00:35:49.292
Zero-sixteen.

578
00:35:49.293 --> 00:35:52.600
Carried that course
for 13 minutes.


579
00:35:52.601 --> 00:35:55.167
So, assuming
the transponder went down


580
00:35:55.168 --> 00:35:56.691
with the lightning strike...

581
00:35:56.692 --> 00:35:57.866
Let's do the math.

582
00:35:57.867 --> 00:36:01.173
That's 17 minutes,

583
00:36:01.174 --> 00:36:04.307
So, multiplying
that out, that's...


584
00:36:04.308 --> 00:36:05.831
Shit.

585
00:36:05.875 --> 00:36:09.356
That's over a thousand
square miles' search radius.


586
00:36:09.357 --> 00:36:11.488
It'll take a miracle
to find us here.


587
00:36:11.489 --> 00:36:15.666
Captain. This island here? Jolo?

588
00:36:15.667 --> 00:36:18.800
It's very, very bad.

589
00:36:18.801 --> 00:36:20.628
-What...
-It's run


590
00:36:20.629 --> 00:36:22.717
by separatists and criminals.

591
00:36:22.718 --> 00:36:24.588
There's no government or police.

592
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:30.986
If this is where we landed,
we're not safe.


593
00:36:30.987 --> 00:36:34.424
All right, we tell Bonnie.

594
00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:38.254
But let's keep this
to ourselves for now.


595
00:36:38.255 --> 00:36:42.389
And then there's this guy,
Mr. Mysterious.


596
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.565
Very friendly.

597
00:36:44.566 --> 00:36:48.546
-No, no, no.
-Captain!


598
00:36:50.093 --> 00:36:56.343
Keep me out
of your fucking videos!


599
00:36:57.709 --> 00:37:00.537
Hey, did you hit your head?
Are you okay?


600
00:37:00.538 --> 00:37:02.017
Maria, can you please
get the medic bag?


601
00:37:02.018 --> 00:37:03.019
Yep.

602
00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:13.463
I'm gonna need you to do
an on-camera hit for the press, Terry.


603
00:37:13.464 --> 00:37:16.379
We'll have a statement prepared,
but you'll need to take questions, too.


604
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.250
Shouldn't we wait till we know
a little bit more?


605
00:37:18.251 --> 00:37:19.948
If we wait until we know more,
it looks like you're hiding something.


606
00:37:19.949 --> 00:37:21.253
Just show
your concern, be humble.


607
00:37:21.254 --> 00:37:24.387
-You know the drill.
-Got it.


608
00:37:24.388 --> 00:37:26.345
Here you go.

609
00:37:26.346 --> 00:37:28.783
You, Mr. Fuckin' Weatherman.

610
00:37:28.784 --> 00:37:30.306
Time to redeem yourself.

611
00:37:30.307 --> 00:37:32.090
I need everything
on that aircraft.


612
00:37:32.091 --> 00:37:33.788
Flight times, maintenance logs.

613
00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:36.007
Names of the techs
who last serviced the plane.


614
00:37:36.008 --> 00:37:41.398
-Everything.
-Yes, sir. Got it.


615
00:38:00.293 --> 00:38:02.469
You sure about this, Captain?

616
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.210
No.

617
00:38:04.254 --> 00:38:07.517
But we're running pretty low
on options.


618
00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:12.000
Look, I'm not tying him up.

619
00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:21.661
If he runs, at least he's away
from the others, right?


620
00:38:25.623 --> 00:38:26.841
All right.

621
00:38:26.842 --> 00:38:33.532
Let's go and break it
to the others.


622
00:38:36.025 --> 00:38:38.766
All right, everybody. Listen up.

623
00:38:38.767 --> 00:38:41.116
So, here's our situation.

624
00:38:41.117 --> 00:38:43.031
Mr. Dele and I,
from our calculations,


625
00:38:43.032 --> 00:38:45.947
we believe that we have landed
on an island


626
00:38:45.948 --> 00:38:48.036
somewhere in the Sulu cluster.

627
00:38:48.037 --> 00:38:49.559
We don't know which island.

628
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.606
The problem is the area
between where the transponder


629
00:38:52.607 --> 00:38:56.479
was struck by lightning
to here is so vast


630
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.134
that search and rescue
could take some time.


631
00:38:59.135 --> 00:39:00.527
-Jesus Christ.
-How long is it gonna take?


632
00:39:00.528 --> 00:39:03.007
We're also gonna have to ration
food and water.


633
00:39:03.008 --> 00:39:04.879
What's your next move?
Smoke signals?


634
00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.228
Can you just keep it
to yourself?


635
00:39:06.229 --> 00:39:07.751
Cut him a break.
At least he landed the plane.


636
00:39:07.752 --> 00:39:08.926
We didn't crash.

637
00:39:08.927 --> 00:39:10.232
We're in the middle
of nowhere though.


638
00:39:10.233 --> 00:39:11.755
-We're stranded.
-Yeah, come on, man.


639
00:39:11.756 --> 00:39:14.236
We didn't crash, man.

640
00:39:14.237 --> 00:39:17.413
Listen, last night, we flew over
some kind of facility.


641
00:39:17.414 --> 00:39:20.764
I'm hoping they have a phone
or a radio.


642
00:39:20.765 --> 00:39:23.550
If I can get there,
make contact,


643
00:39:23.551 --> 00:39:26.161
we could be rescued in hours.

644
00:39:26.162 --> 00:39:28.642
Until then, I need everybody
to be careful


645
00:39:28.643 --> 00:39:30.948
because we don't know
what's going on in that jungle.


646
00:39:30.949 --> 00:39:32.428
-I'll go with you.
-I will come, too.


647
00:39:32.429 --> 00:39:33.864
I appreciate it.

648
00:39:33.865 --> 00:39:36.475
But Mr. Gaspare
has kindly volunteered to come.


649
00:39:36.476 --> 00:39:37.565
What?

650
00:39:37.608 --> 00:39:39.043
You're taking a guy
in handcuffs?


651
00:39:39.044 --> 00:39:41.324
-Makes sense.

652
00:40:02.764 --> 00:40:04.344
Come on.

653
00:40:37.625 --> 00:40:38.635
Datu!

654
00:40:40.323 --> 00:40:41.333
Datu!

655
00:40:44.283 --> 00:40:45.293
Datu!

656
00:40:48.553 --> 00:40:50.679
What's the matter, Uncle?

657
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.767
Last night a big Kano airplane
flew over my house.


658
00:40:54.768 --> 00:40:58.937
Out by the old mine.
It was flying very low, Datu.


659
00:40:58.938 --> 00:41:02.066
-To land, I think...
-To land?


660
00:41:02.067 --> 00:41:03.442
I think so.

661
00:41:03.443 --> 00:41:07.863
You sure it wasn't an army plane?

662
00:41:07.864 --> 00:41:09.782
It's not the army.

663
00:41:09.783 --> 00:41:15.162
My spies in Manila would have warned us.

664
00:41:15.163 --> 00:41:17.873
For the family.

665
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.757
Find this plane.

666
00:41:35.595 --> 00:41:37.379
Well, we're doing everything
we possibly can


667
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.773
to find Flight 119,
sparing no expense.


668
00:41:39.774 --> 00:41:42.601
Have you determined
that the plane has crashed?


669
00:41:42.602 --> 00:41:44.778
Uh, no, that's not
the assumption.


670
00:41:44.779 --> 00:41:46.562
-We have very little...
-You sure it's Dad's flight?


671
00:41:46.563 --> 00:41:48.172
-We are coordinating...
-I'm sure.


672
00:41:48.173 --> 00:41:49.521
...the search and rescue
efforts in the region.


673
00:41:49.522 --> 00:41:50.785
No.

674
00:41:50.828 --> 00:41:52.524
As soon as we have
some updates,


675
00:41:52.525 --> 00:42:02.525
hopefully some positive news,
we'll get right back to you.


676
00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:08.932
I peeked through
your officer's bag for supplies.


677
00:42:08.933 --> 00:42:11.282
I came across your pocketknife.

678
00:42:11.283 --> 00:42:13.676
You former military
or something'?


679
00:42:13.677 --> 00:42:17.114
Groupe des
Commandos Parachutistes.


680
00:42:17.115 --> 00:42:19.290
French Foreign Legion.

681
00:42:19.291 --> 00:42:20.727
Pay and benefits suck,

682
00:42:20.728 --> 00:42:23.730
but they don't ask any questions
if you can hack it.


683
00:42:23.731 --> 00:42:24.818
Questions?

684
00:42:24.819 --> 00:42:26.907
Nothing's black
and white, Captain.


685
00:42:26.908 --> 00:42:29.605
I was just at the wrong place
at the wrong time.


686
00:42:29.606 --> 00:42:31.781
No one cares
what really happened.


687
00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:35.219
I was 18 and fucked.

688
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:40.311
So, rather than, uh, rot in prison,
I ran, joined the Legion.


689
00:42:40.312 --> 00:42:42.052
End of story.

690
00:42:42.053 --> 00:42:45.969
How'd you get caught?

691
00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:50.520
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

692
00:42:51.062 --> 00:42:54.369
Now let me ask you something.

693
00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:57.851
Did you bring my knife?

694
00:42:57.852 --> 00:42:59.548
Sorry, no.

695
00:42:59.549 --> 00:43:02.464
I left it in the bag.

696
00:43:02.465 --> 00:43:08.435
How about
the dead officer's gun?


697
00:43:12.649 --> 00:43:19.179
We should
be getting close about now.


698
00:43:27.751 --> 00:43:29.447
Brodie Torrance.

699
00:43:29.448 --> 00:43:32.189
Scottish, UK citizen.
Royal Air Force.


700
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:33.974
Then flew commercial
for 20 years.


701
00:43:33.975 --> 00:43:36.759
New York to London,
Paris, Tokyo. Hot-shit routes.


702
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.067
Since then, he's been flying Egypt,
Meridiana, Frontier


703
00:43:40.068 --> 00:43:42.809
and Trailblazer,
flying shit third-tier routes.


704
00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:46.682
-Why? What happened?
-Check the video file.


705
00:43:46.683 --> 00:43:48.379
Hey, where's my drink?

706
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.554
-Oh, Jesus.
-I asked you for a drink,


707
00:43:49.555 --> 00:43:50.729
like, 10 minutes ago.

708
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:51.861
What do you want?
Get out of here.


709
00:43:51.862 --> 00:43:53.036
Hey, hey, hey!

710
00:43:53.037 --> 00:43:57.587
-What the hell is going...

711
00:44:02.307 --> 00:44:06.437
Can this get any worse?

712
00:44:08.792 --> 00:44:11.838
That's right. That's right.

713
00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:14.839
I like this guy.

714
00:44:35.471 --> 00:44:37.331
Holy shit.

715
00:46:20.837 --> 00:46:22.926
Fuck. Okay.

716
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.064
John Shellback,
it's David Scarsdale.


717
00:46:31.065 --> 00:46:32.587
What's your status?

718
00:46:32.588 --> 00:46:35.590
We're prepping to load now.
Should be in the air 0900.


719
00:46:35.591 --> 00:46:38.549
Please, Scardy, tell me
we're going back to Macau.


720
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:41.291
File a flight plan
for Manila,


721
00:46:41.292 --> 00:46:42.989
and we'll see
how things shake out.


722
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.555
Are you telling me
you have no idea


723
00:46:44.556 --> 00:46:45.948
where this plane actually is?

724
00:46:45.949 --> 00:46:48.995
It's not in Macau.
I can tell you that.


725
00:46:48.996 --> 00:46:53.216
That's gonna be extra, Scardy.
That's going to be extra.


726
00:46:53.217 --> 00:46:55.175
Happy fuckin' New Year.

727
00:46:55.176 --> 00:46:56.177
Out.

728
00:46:58.396 --> 00:46:59.962
They're on their way.

729
00:46:59.963 --> 00:47:01.703
They'll reach the area
in about three hours,


730
00:47:01.704 --> 00:47:07.665
then parachute in once we get
the plane's location.


731
00:47:07.666 --> 00:47:09.450
So, how much
in the emergency fund?


732
00:47:09.451 --> 00:47:10.755
Half million.

733
00:47:10.756 --> 00:47:12.931
Great. That might be enough
to get one of us


734
00:47:12.932 --> 00:47:15.021
-out of Indonesian prison.
-Here.


735
00:47:15.022 --> 00:47:23.822
-Are we good, boys?
-Good now. There you go, boss.


736
00:47:29.427 --> 00:47:31.707
One, eight...

737
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.443
Welcome
to Trailblazer Airlines.


738
00:47:46.444 --> 00:47:49.229
-This is Carmen.
-Carmen, listen carefully.


739
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:51.057
This is an emergency.

740
00:47:51.058 --> 00:47:55.887
I'm Captain Brodie Torrance.
Trailblazer 119.


741
00:47:55.888 --> 00:47:59.326
We've gone down on an island
in the Sulu Sea.


742
00:47:59.327 --> 00:48:00.457
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

743
00:48:00.458 --> 00:48:03.547
My name
is Captain Brodie Torrance.


744
00:48:03.548 --> 00:48:06.594
And I'm the captain
of Trailblazer 119.


745
00:48:06.595 --> 00:48:09.510
Now, we've gone down.
We made a crash landing on...


746
00:48:09.511 --> 00:48:10.946
Sir, we've been
getting crank calls


747
00:48:10.947 --> 00:48:12.904
-all day about this.
-No. Hello?


748
00:48:12.905 --> 00:48:14.776
I hear you. I'm here.

749
00:48:14.777 --> 00:48:16.865
Now, I need you to patch me through
to emergency ops immediately.


750
00:48:16.866 --> 00:48:18.823
Listen, we've been getting
calls all day about this.


751
00:48:18.824 --> 00:48:20.782
-Just shut up and listen.
-Calm down, sir.


752
00:48:20.783 --> 00:48:22.392
-We've been getting...
-Sorry.


753
00:48:22.393 --> 00:48:24.829
...crank calls all day long
about this disappearance.


754
00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:28.181
Now, can you tell me
your employee badge number.


755
00:48:28.182 --> 00:48:30.749
Fuck.

756
00:48:30.793 --> 00:48:33.882
I don't actually have
my badge on me, Carmen.


757
00:48:33.883 --> 00:48:36.058
-I need you to believe me on this.
-Sir, without your badge...


758
00:48:36.059 --> 00:48:37.451
-Carmen.
-Sir...


759
00:48:37.452 --> 00:48:39.061
-Can you hear what I'm saying?
-I can hear you.


760
00:48:39.062 --> 00:48:40.889
-Our flight has gone down.
-Without your badge number...


761
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:43.413
-I'm the captain of Trail...

762
00:48:43.414 --> 00:48:44.564
Hello?

763
00:48:50.029 --> 00:48:56.139
Nail the badge
to my fucking head.


764
00:48:59.691 --> 00:49:01.736
All right, Daniela.

765
00:49:01.737 --> 00:49:05.167
Don't let me down.

766
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.354
-Hello?

767
00:49:10.398 --> 00:49:13.879
Daniela?
Thank God.


768
00:49:15.229 --> 00:49:17.665
-Hey, can you hear me?

769
00:49:17.666 --> 00:49:19.928
-Now, listen. Don't...
-Dad? Is that you?


770
00:49:19.929 --> 00:49:21.930
-Yes, sweetheart. It's me.
-You're okay?


771
00:49:21.931 --> 00:49:23.584
-Dad.
-I'm okay, I'm okay.


772
00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:26.848
Now, don't talk. Just listen,
'cause we might cut out, okay?


773
00:49:26.849 --> 00:49:30.547
Quick. Grab something
to write with.


774
00:49:30.548 --> 00:49:32.549
-Dani?
-Not now, Aunt Carrie.


775
00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:34.986
-Is that your dad? Dani.
-Yes, yes!


776
00:49:34.987 --> 00:49:37.250
-Where are you, Brodie?
-Okay, I got it.


777
00:49:37.251 --> 00:49:39.208
We've gone down, all right?

778
00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:42.603
I want you to write what I say,
and get it to Trailblazer immediately.


779
00:49:42.604 --> 00:49:44.214
Okay.

780
00:49:44.258 --> 00:49:47.912
All right, we're on an island
somewhere in the Jolo cluster


781
00:49:47.913 --> 00:49:49.479
in the Sulu Sea.

782
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.655
Now, we have no radio.

783
00:49:51.656 --> 00:49:55.311
And I don't know
what island we're on.


784
00:49:55.312 --> 00:49:56.617
Wait, no, stop!

785
00:49:56.618 --> 00:49:58.898
-Dad!
-Wait!


786
00:52:00.916 --> 00:52:02.636
Oh, fuck.

787
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:25.114
Fuck.

788
00:52:50.008 --> 00:52:52.662
You can come out, Captain.

789
00:52:52.663 --> 00:52:56.943
I'm not gonna hurt you.

790
00:53:07.678 --> 00:53:13.857
Drink it all. Hurry.
We gotta move.


791
00:53:13.858 --> 00:53:16.288
Are you okay?

792
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.428
No.

793
00:53:18.472 --> 00:53:21.169
Would you rather
that be you?


794
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.737
-No.
-That's it, then.


795
00:53:23.738 --> 00:53:25.826
You bury it all.

796
00:53:25.827 --> 00:53:29.527
Deal with shit later.

797
00:53:29.831 --> 00:53:32.111
Reach anyone?

798
00:53:33.095 --> 00:53:34.096
Yes.

799
00:53:35.314 --> 00:53:37.272
But we can't depend on it.

800
00:53:37.273 --> 00:53:39.993
I got cut off.

801
00:53:54.508 --> 00:53:56.334
It's loaded.

802
00:53:56.335 --> 00:54:00.885
Slip the safety and shoot.

803
00:54:07.017 --> 00:54:10.603
-Datu. We found it!
-Where?


804
00:54:10.604 --> 00:54:13.106
On the mining road.

805
00:54:13.107 --> 00:54:16.247
A very big plane.

806
00:54:17.319 --> 00:54:20.113
How many people?
Any foreigners?


807
00:54:20.114 --> 00:54:24.409
We didn't get close enough to see.

808
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:28.830
Let's get a closer look.

809
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:35.112
Lucky for you,
I snuck up on these guys.


810
00:54:35.113 --> 00:54:43.083
I got a feeling
we're gonna see a lot more.


811
00:54:48.779 --> 00:54:52.479
Hey. Hey.
Come here.


812
00:55:05.579 --> 00:55:06.623
Look.

813
00:55:18.983 --> 00:55:24.523
Hey, they've got passports here.

814
00:55:28.602 --> 00:55:30.882
Filipino, UK.

815
00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:44.383
Hey, Torrance.

816
00:55:46.445 --> 00:55:48.305
Look here.

817
00:55:55.542 --> 00:55:57.412
Mark and Maria Burnham.

818
00:55:57.413 --> 00:56:01.416
Missionaries with
the Good Samaritan Fellowship.


819
00:56:01.417 --> 00:56:02.939
Holy shit.

820
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:07.291
$200,000 needs to be prepared
in cash by tomorrow.


821
00:56:07.292 --> 00:56:09.946
They say instructions
to follow for that


822
00:56:09.947 --> 00:56:17.171
by tomorrow or they're...
They're gonna kill us.


823
00:56:17.172 --> 00:56:22.432
I gotta get to the passengers.

824
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.080
Ah, shit.

825
00:56:36.017 --> 00:56:37.597
Come on.

826
00:57:17.449 --> 00:57:20.930
-Do you hear that?
-Yeah.


827
00:57:20.931 --> 00:57:23.921
Someone's coming.

828
00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:40.297
-Hey. Hey!
-Hey, hey!


829
00:57:40.298 --> 00:57:42.082
-Hey!
-Hey, hey!


830
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:44.432
We're here.
Yes! We're here!


831
00:57:44.433 --> 00:57:47.435
Hey, get back. Get back!

832
00:57:47.436 --> 00:57:48.697
Get back, get back.
We don't know who it is.


833
00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:49.916
We don't know who it is.

834
00:57:49.917 --> 00:57:51.047
-Get back! Get back in!
-Come on.


835
00:57:51.048 --> 00:57:54.178
-Hey, hey!
-Stop!


836
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:10.371
Hear that? Stop the truck.

837
00:58:10.372 --> 00:58:11.382
What?

838
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:23.210
What the fuck
is the matter with...


839
00:58:23.211 --> 00:58:25.071
-Oh, shit.

840
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:43.740
Where is captain?

841
00:58:54.982 --> 00:58:57.702
I'm in charge.

842
00:59:00.596 --> 00:59:02.316
Hey, hey.

843
00:59:07.864 --> 00:59:11.475
Give list. Passenger list.

844
00:59:11.476 --> 00:59:14.043
Oh, shit. Yeah,
I've gotta go in there.


845
00:59:14.044 --> 00:59:21.268
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
No, wait, wait, wait.


846
00:59:21.269 --> 00:59:23.829
Passenger list.

847
00:59:37.807 --> 00:59:41.777
Captain Brodie Torrance?

848
00:59:43.726 --> 00:59:46.119
Captain Torrance isn't here.

849
00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:48.410
Where is he?

850
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:53.822
-Where is he?

851
00:59:53.823 --> 00:59:58.373
Hey, hey, hey, stop. Stop.

852
01:00:00.134 --> 01:00:03.658
He went...
He went looking for help.


853
01:00:03.659 --> 01:00:04.877
-Help where?
-I don't know!


854
01:00:04.878 --> 01:00:08.184
Just a phone, a radio!

855
01:00:08.185 --> 01:00:13.315
So, no one know you're here?

856
01:00:17.673 --> 01:00:19.327
-No!

857
01:00:39.564 --> 01:00:40.783
Oh.

858
01:00:42.654 --> 01:00:44.804
Oh, my God.

859
01:00:48.399 --> 01:00:49.969
Passport.

860
01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.178
Korean.

861
01:01:02.936 --> 01:01:05.936
Get on bus, now!

862
01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:09.246
Go! Move!

863
01:01:15.426 --> 01:01:16.514
Move!

864
01:01:19.648 --> 01:01:23.218
No, no, no, no, no.

865
01:01:26.164 --> 01:01:29.292
Computers, jewelry, iPads...

866
01:01:29.293 --> 01:01:31.993
Load everything.

867
01:01:52.855 --> 01:01:54.856
Fuck is wrong with you?

868
01:01:54.857 --> 01:01:56.292
What the fuck is your problem?

869
01:01:56.293 --> 01:02:05.813
What the fuck were you gonna do?
It's a fucking army.


870
01:02:16.879 --> 01:02:19.707
We can still find out
where they are.


871
01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:21.013
They're gonna know
where they are.


872
01:02:21.014 --> 01:02:22.492
Then what? Oh, God.

873
01:02:22.493 --> 01:02:24.146
-They're gonna know.
-The fuck?


874
01:02:24.147 --> 01:02:28.407
-Hey!
-Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.


875
01:02:33.156 --> 01:02:36.576
Don't fucking move.

876
01:02:39.336 --> 01:02:42.643
-You speak English?
-Yes. Yes.


877
01:02:42.644 --> 01:02:44.514
-Little. Little.
-Empty your pockets.


878
01:02:44.515 --> 01:02:46.516
-Come on.
-Okay.


879
01:02:46.517 --> 01:02:50.217
Hands over your head.

880
01:02:53.611 --> 01:02:54.960
Who's that?

881
01:02:54.961 --> 01:02:57.101
Datu Junmar.

882
01:02:57.615 --> 01:02:59.051
He in charge.

883
01:02:59.052 --> 01:03:01.575
"Datu" means "chief."

884
01:03:01.576 --> 01:03:03.490
Where's he taking them?

885
01:03:03.491 --> 01:03:06.058
Hey! Where's he taking them?

886
01:03:06.059 --> 01:03:08.408
I tell you, Datu kill me.

887
01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:13.669
-Kill my family.
-Me or Datu?


888
01:03:14.632 --> 01:03:17.472
Dandulit village.

889
01:03:19.246 --> 01:03:22.422
Where is he keeping them
in Dandulit?


890
01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:25.563
Come on. Come on!

891
01:03:25.948 --> 01:03:31.257
Warehouse, on the river.
Then boat takes.


892
01:03:31.258 --> 01:03:32.780
Boat takes 'em where?

893
01:03:32.781 --> 01:03:34.042
I don't know.

894
01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:37.480
Where? Fucking tell me where.

895
01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:40.222
-Tell me. Come on!
-I don't know!


896
01:03:40.223 --> 01:03:44.633
Whatever Datu say, we do.

897
01:03:45.663 --> 01:03:47.534
I gotta go after them.

898
01:03:47.535 --> 01:03:50.754
And do what? We should wait.

899
01:03:50.755 --> 01:03:52.104
You said you made contact.

900
01:03:52.105 --> 01:03:53.757
I don't know
how much got through.


901
01:03:53.758 --> 01:03:55.977
And I'm not waiting here
to find out.


902
01:03:55.978 --> 01:03:59.589
They're my passengers.
They're my responsibility.


903
01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:01.896
You don't have to come.
I'm not expecting you to.


904
01:04:01.897 --> 01:04:05.030
And I'm the captain
of Trailblazer 119.


905
01:04:05.031 --> 01:04:08.163
Now, we've gone down.
We made a crash landing on...


906
01:04:08.164 --> 01:04:09.512
Sir,
we've been getting crank calls


907
01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.123
-all day about this.
-No. Hello?


908
01:04:11.124 --> 01:04:12.559
I hear you. I'm here.

909
01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.647
Now, I need you
to patch me through


910
01:04:13.648 --> 01:04:15.562
to emergency ops immediately.

911
01:04:15.563 --> 01:04:17.564
Listen, we've been getting
calls all day about this.


912
01:04:17.565 --> 01:04:18.826
-Just shut up and listen.
-Calm down, sir.


913
01:04:18.827 --> 01:04:20.958
After that call was cut off,

914
01:04:20.959 --> 01:04:23.570
Torrance phoned his daughter,
Daniela, in Maui.


915
01:04:23.571 --> 01:04:26.138
She confirmed the details
of the recording.


916
01:04:26.139 --> 01:04:27.574
And she said he told her
they went down


917
01:04:27.575 --> 01:04:29.924
somewhere in
the Jolo island cluster.


918
01:04:29.925 --> 01:04:33.754
I need Key Hole satellite access
to this area to find that plane.


919
01:04:33.755 --> 01:04:35.060
Our assets are going airborne,

920
01:04:35.061 --> 01:04:36.452
and we'll circle
the Jolo cluster


921
01:04:36.453 --> 01:04:37.888
until we get them
a drop location.


922
01:04:37.889 --> 01:04:39.107
But I need you
to call in some favors


923
01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:44.368
-and make it happen.
-Got it.


924
01:05:01.478 --> 01:05:04.188
Good job, Dele.

925
01:05:46.219 --> 01:05:48.656
Passen...

926
01:06:29.566 --> 01:06:35.745
Dandulit village
is one road in, one road out.


927
01:06:35.746 --> 01:06:37.834
Is this any use to me?

928
01:06:37.835 --> 01:06:40.965
You speak Tagalog?

929
01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:55.504
Yeah, she's plugging it in now.

930
01:06:55.505 --> 01:06:57.114
Wait, I got... I think...

931
01:06:57.115 --> 01:06:58.377
-We got it. We got it.
-We're there.


932
01:06:58.378 --> 01:07:01.467
Found it. Dave, found the plane.

933
01:07:01.468 --> 01:07:07.734
Jolo island. Torrance was right.
Stand by.


934
01:07:07.735 --> 01:07:08.909
And there it is.

935
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:11.041
Can't believe
it's intact.


936
01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:13.087
Sending the coordinates
to our assets now.


937
01:07:13.088 --> 01:07:15.045
They'll drop on-site ASAP.

938
01:07:15.046 --> 01:07:16.308
Well, there's really no need.

939
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:17.744
They'll contact
the Philippine government.


940
01:07:17.745 --> 01:07:19.311
Surely, they'll send
local authorities


941
01:07:19.312 --> 01:07:21.530
-with a search and rescue.
-It won't be that easy, Terry.


942
01:07:21.531 --> 01:07:22.879
-Why?
-Because there is


943
01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.403
no authority on Jolo island.

944
01:07:24.404 --> 01:07:26.143
It's run by separatists
and militias.


945
01:07:26.144 --> 01:07:28.102
The Filipino army
won't even go there anymore.


946
01:07:28.103 --> 01:07:30.670
They got their asses kicked
so many times.


947
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:32.933
Look, the guys
will parachute in.


948
01:07:32.934 --> 01:07:42.294
But they're gonna need some help
getting everyone out.


949
01:07:46.382 --> 01:07:49.036
The village is two kilometers
in that direction.


950
01:07:49.037 --> 01:07:51.908
You know you can't
just ask for them back.


951
01:07:51.909 --> 01:07:53.388
Yeah, well,
you're the military man.


952
01:07:53.389 --> 01:07:57.349
I was hoping
you'd have some ideas.


953
01:07:57.350 --> 01:07:58.930
Ah, man.

954
01:08:00.178 --> 01:08:04.578
Thank you...
for helping.


955
01:08:12.713 --> 01:08:14.627
A priest in the Legion
used to say,


956
01:08:14.628 --> 01:08:18.587
"Redemption can only be found
in the most unusual places."


957
01:08:18.588 --> 01:08:23.688
Well, this certainly qualifies.

958
01:08:36.563 --> 01:08:38.738
Wait.
Hey, hey. Hey, stop!


959
01:08:38.739 --> 01:08:40.087
Stop! What are you doing?

960
01:08:40.088 --> 01:08:42.938
Yeah, hey, stop!

961
01:08:43.265 --> 01:08:49.375
Come. Come on.
Come here. Come on.


962
01:08:50.403 --> 01:08:55.233
-Come, come, come.
-No. No!


963
01:09:01.327 --> 01:09:02.544
Name. Country.

964
01:09:02.545 --> 01:09:03.981
-Oh!

965
01:09:04.025 --> 01:09:05.286
Name! Country!

966
01:09:05.287 --> 01:09:07.462
Maxwell Carver, England.

967
01:09:07.463 --> 01:09:08.985
Name. Country.

968
01:09:08.986 --> 01:09:11.684
Brie Taylor, American.

969
01:09:11.685 --> 01:09:14.105
Name. Country.

970
01:09:14.514 --> 01:09:15.732
-Oh!

971
01:09:16.951 --> 01:09:18.908
Name! Country!

972
01:09:18.909 --> 01:09:22.347
Matt Sinclair, American!

973
01:09:22.348 --> 01:09:24.768
Name. Country.

974
01:09:24.785 --> 01:09:27.308
Katie Dhar, Sweden.

975
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:29.354
Name. Country.

976
01:09:29.355 --> 01:09:33.335
Samuel Dele, Hong Kong.

977
01:09:42.106 --> 01:09:44.020
Shellback. Two dead jundies.

978
01:09:44.021 --> 01:09:45.892
Roger that. Set security.

979
01:09:45.893 --> 01:09:48.068
Go police up the chutes.
Get them out the open.


980
01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:50.287
Trailblazer CP,
this is Shellback 6.


981
01:09:50.288 --> 01:09:51.463
How copy?

982
01:09:51.464 --> 01:09:53.465
We got you on comms, Shellback.

983
01:09:53.466 --> 01:09:58.156
Getting your visual up now.

984
01:09:58.209 --> 01:10:04.889
Let's check the plane.
Check. On you.


985
01:10:06.653 --> 01:10:09.568
Yeah, Terry here.

986
01:10:09.569 --> 01:10:13.699
What do you mean, "No?"

987
01:10:18.316 --> 01:10:20.927
We've got two bodies
in the rear galley.


988
01:10:20.928 --> 01:10:23.788
Give us a look.

989
01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.984
Shit.

990
01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:43.732
Looks like it might be
crew members.


991
01:10:43.733 --> 01:10:46.039
Did you properly convey
the urgency of the situation?


992
01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.782
-Zip 'em up. We got 'em.
-That's unacceptable.


993
01:10:49.783 --> 01:10:54.482
That is unacceptable.
You tell 'em I said that.


994
01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:55.918
Filipinos won't send
a rescue team


995
01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.616
without a battalion
of troops in support.


996
01:10:57.617 --> 01:10:58.965
They're saying 24 hours.

997
01:10:58.966 --> 01:11:01.396
True to form.

998
01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:03.926
Any sign of the passengers
or the rest of the crew?


999
01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:05.450
That's a negative, boss.

1000
01:11:05.451 --> 01:11:11.851
At least from
what I see right now.


1001
01:11:22.032 --> 01:11:24.078
Shit.

1002
01:11:24.121 --> 01:11:26.732
Trailblazer CP,
you're seeing this, right?


1003
01:11:26.733 --> 01:11:36.663
Looks like we may have
a hostage situation on our hands.


1004
01:11:41.399 --> 01:11:43.183
You see the boats?

1005
01:11:43.184 --> 01:11:44.793
They're fueling them up.

1006
01:11:44.794 --> 01:11:46.013
Shit.

1007
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.930
Taking them off the island.

1008
01:11:50.931 --> 01:11:56.201
Once they're gone, that's it.

1009
01:12:30.448 --> 01:12:32.624
We have to do this quietly.

1010
01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:37.977
No guns until
we absolutely have to.


1011
01:12:37.978 --> 01:12:41.720
That's it? That's your plan?

1012
01:12:41.721 --> 01:12:45.571
You got a better one?

1013
01:13:08.138 --> 01:13:10.445
Oh, shit.

1014
01:13:14.536 --> 01:13:17.538
That's him. That's Junmar.

1015
01:13:17.539 --> 01:13:19.366
That's the bus.

1016
01:13:19.367 --> 01:13:22.456
They gotta be in that house.

1017
01:13:22.457 --> 01:13:24.177
This way.

1018
01:14:46.541 --> 01:14:48.412
Oh, shit.

1019
01:15:11.914 --> 01:15:13.046
Go.

1020
01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:17.441
Psst.

1021
01:15:24.971 --> 01:15:27.015
Hey, everybody okay?

1022
01:15:27.016 --> 01:15:28.234
-Yes.
-Yes.


1023
01:15:28.235 --> 01:15:30.105
-What's happening?
-All right. Okay.


1024
01:15:30.106 --> 01:15:33.239
We're gonna get everybody freed up
and ready to move.


1025
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.415
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1026
01:15:35.416 --> 01:15:37.591
Hey, I'm gonna
have a look around.


1027
01:15:37.592 --> 01:15:39.463
Okay.

1028
01:15:39.507 --> 01:15:42.204
Now, we're gonna load back up
on that bus.


1029
01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:44.685
-Where are we going?
-Back to the plane.


1030
01:15:44.686 --> 01:15:46.122
What?

1031
01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:48.167
It's all right.
I've made contact with Trailblazer.


1032
01:15:48.168 --> 01:15:51.083
I'm not sure what got through,
but they know we're alive.


1033
01:15:51.084 --> 01:15:54.739
So, they find that plane,
and they find us. All right?


1034
01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.392
-Everybody ready to move?
-Yes.


1035
01:15:56.393 --> 01:16:01.363
All right. Shh.
Quiet. Fast.


1036
01:16:06.577 --> 01:16:08.883
Okay. Quick, quick, quick.

1037
01:16:08.884 --> 01:16:11.164
Quick. Hurry.

1038
01:16:12.758 --> 01:16:18.298
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Go, go, go.

1039
01:16:24.334 --> 01:16:25.639
Can you drive this thing?

1040
01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:29.251
Yeah. I can drive anything.

1041
01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:33.690
Okay. Here are the keys.
I think it's the big one.


1042
01:16:33.691 --> 01:16:35.127
-Stop.
-What?


1043
01:16:35.128 --> 01:16:36.476
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1044
01:16:36.477 --> 01:16:38.565
There's a bunch
of armed fuckers on the road.


1045
01:16:38.566 --> 01:16:41.524
We're gonna get mowed down
if we try to drive past them.


1046
01:16:41.525 --> 01:16:46.660
I can engage 'em, but it's just gonna
draw more of 'em.


1047
01:16:46.661 --> 01:16:47.671
Shit.

1048
01:17:00.196 --> 01:17:02.894
Okay, I can handle these guys.

1049
01:17:02.895 --> 01:17:05.897
How are you gonna do that?

1050
01:17:05.898 --> 01:17:11.772
I'm gonna distract them.
I'm gonna give myself up.


1051
01:17:11.773 --> 01:17:16.777
-That's your plan?
-Oh, you have a better one?


1052
01:17:16.778 --> 01:17:19.127
Look, we don't have
any other choice.


1053
01:17:19.128 --> 01:17:22.827
You're never gonna see
your goddamn family again.


1054
01:17:22.828 --> 01:17:25.394
What about their families?

1055
01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:28.441
Look, you know
I have to try, right?


1056
01:17:28.442 --> 01:17:30.182
I mean, I'm the captain.

1057
01:17:30.183 --> 01:17:33.707
These assholes are never gonna kill me.
Worth too much to them.


1058
01:17:33.708 --> 01:17:35.797
-Yeah.

1059
01:17:35.841 --> 01:17:39.541
Wait here. Take this.

1060
01:17:54.468 --> 01:17:56.888
Hello? Anyone?

1061
01:18:01.605 --> 01:18:05.826
I need to speak to Junmar.

1062
01:18:05.827 --> 01:18:07.393
And I'm unarmed!

1063
01:18:07.394 --> 01:18:14.794
No, I'm the captain.
I'm the pilot here.


1064
01:18:19.406 --> 01:18:25.226
You're a pilot?
Captain Torrance?


1065
01:18:25.281 --> 01:18:28.849
I need to speak to Junmar.

1066
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:30.990
Datu Junmar.

1067
01:18:49.697 --> 01:18:54.527
Other pilot say you leave
passengers to call for help.


1068
01:18:54.528 --> 01:18:58.238
How that go for you?

1069
01:18:59.446 --> 01:19:02.752
I came to talk to you
about that.


1070
01:19:02.753 --> 01:19:04.798
I contacted Manila.

1071
01:19:04.799 --> 01:19:06.191
They send, uh,

1072
01:19:06.192 --> 01:19:09.672
search and rescue for us,
lots of soldiers.


1073
01:19:09.673 --> 01:19:18.333
So, I'll be having
my passengers back, thank you.


1074
01:19:20.119 --> 01:19:21.423
You think you come here,

1075
01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:26.298
speak to me,
tell me do what you say.


1076
01:19:26.299 --> 01:19:29.709
You think backwards.

1077
01:19:30.825 --> 01:19:35.046
You in Jolo now, 
Pilot Torrance.

1078
01:19:35.047 --> 01:19:38.037
No rescue coming.

1079
01:19:38.354 --> 01:19:41.878
Look, we had problems
in the air.


1080
01:19:41.879 --> 01:19:44.838
I had to land the plane.

1081
01:19:44.839 --> 01:19:46.666
My people just want to go home.

1082
01:19:46.667 --> 01:19:49.756
-You can understand.
-They're my people now.


1083
01:19:49.757 --> 01:19:51.497
You're mine.

1084
01:19:51.498 --> 01:19:54.065
No matter why.

1085
01:19:54.066 --> 01:19:56.719
Everything in Jolo belong to me.

1086
01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.290
Until I don't want.

1087
01:20:04.946 --> 01:20:07.904
No one care when small man die.

1088
01:20:07.905 --> 01:20:11.038
But I make example of big man?

1089
01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:13.189
I kill him?

1090
01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:19.501
Now they care. Now they pay.

1091
01:20:21.136 --> 01:20:22.856
Fuck you.

1092
01:20:24.966 --> 01:20:26.116
Hajan.

1093
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:48.728
They're friendlies, Captain.
Stay where you are. Stay where you are.


1094
01:20:48.729 --> 01:20:50.449
You hurt?

1095
01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:53.211
Captain Torrance, are you hurt?

1096
01:20:53.212 --> 01:20:54.299
No, I'm okay.

1097
01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:55.735
We got the package intact.

1098
01:20:55.736 --> 01:20:58.781
Eastern row, main house.
How copy? Shellback, out.


1099
01:20:58.782 --> 01:21:00.609
-Lake, you got the package.
-No, wait. Take the others.


1100
01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:05.614
Hey, we got them. Let's move!

1101
01:21:05.615 --> 01:21:06.703
Move!

1102
01:21:09.619 --> 01:21:12.189
Move! Move in!

1103
01:21:15.277 --> 01:21:17.847
Got you. Move.

1104
01:21:18.628 --> 01:21:21.326
-Everybody okay?
-Everybody, get down!


1105
01:21:21.327 --> 01:21:25.457
Roll out! Roll out now!

1106
01:21:29.857 --> 01:21:31.641
Hajan!

1107
01:21:35.297 --> 01:21:36.447
Hajan.

1108
01:21:41.587 --> 01:21:43.880
Wake up the island!

1109
01:21:43.881 --> 01:21:47.721
Everyone to the plane!

1110
01:21:51.183 --> 01:21:53.967
Took a hell of a beating,
Captain. How are you feeling?


1111
01:21:53.968 --> 01:21:56.317
Okay. Okay, thanks.

1112
01:21:56.318 --> 01:21:57.971
Who are you guys?

1113
01:21:57.972 --> 01:21:59.407
We're Trailblazer's
forward advance crew on this.


1114
01:21:59.408 --> 01:22:02.976
John Isaac.
Mo, Willis, and Lake.


1115
01:22:02.977 --> 01:22:04.325
So, hold on.

1116
01:22:04.326 --> 01:22:06.719
You're the advance crew.

1117
01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.329
When is the rescue team
getting here?


1118
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:11.854
Twenty-four hours
is the best Trailblazer can do,


1119
01:22:11.855 --> 01:22:14.422
so, unfortunately,
we just became the rescue team.


1120
01:22:14.423 --> 01:22:17.077
Twenty-four hours.

1121
01:22:17.078 --> 01:22:18.774
We won't be left by then.

1122
01:22:18.775 --> 01:22:21.690
I understand, and that's why
we need to work up a contingency.


1123
01:22:21.691 --> 01:22:24.040
Now, we did bring
an emergency fund,


1124
01:22:24.041 --> 01:22:28.436
but not enough to buy our way
off this island. So...


1125
01:22:28.437 --> 01:22:34.687
What do you suggest
we do, Captain?


1126
01:22:35.749 --> 01:22:36.837
Fuck.

1127
01:22:38.099 --> 01:22:40.679
I got a plan.

1128
01:22:41.842 --> 01:22:43.799
No, that's not the assumption.

1129
01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.758
We have very little information
at present.


1130
01:22:45.759 --> 01:22:47.412
However, we are coordinating

1131
01:22:47.413 --> 01:22:49.544
with all the search and rescue
efforts in the region.


1132
01:22:49.545 --> 01:22:51.675
-Hopefully...

1133
01:23:07.563 --> 01:23:08.564
Dad.

1134
01:23:11.263 --> 01:23:16.092
I don't know
if you'll get this, but...


1135
01:23:16.093 --> 01:23:19.663
I love you so much.

1136
01:23:19.706 --> 01:23:23.056
You are the most
amazing father.


1137
01:23:23.057 --> 01:23:26.886
And I'm sorry
if I don't say it enough.


1138
01:23:26.887 --> 01:23:30.019
I don't know what's happening.

1139
01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:33.450
Or if you're hurt.

1140
01:23:33.546 --> 01:23:36.266
I'm so scared.

1141
01:23:36.853 --> 01:23:41.403
So, just please come home.

1142
01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:51.258
Trailblazer CP,
this is Shellback 6.


1143
01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:54.043
Let's wait a sec.
Copy, 6. What's your status?


1144
01:23:54.044 --> 01:23:56.655
Hostages secure,
but we've got another plan.


1145
01:23:56.656 --> 01:23:57.960
You're not gonna like it.

1146
01:23:57.961 --> 01:23:59.092
Come on. Everybody, hurry.

1147
01:23:59.093 --> 01:24:00.398
Run, run, run!

1148
01:24:00.399 --> 01:24:01.790
Hey, gather them here.

1149
01:24:01.791 --> 01:24:03.575
-Everyone, come on.
-Gather around.


1150
01:24:03.576 --> 01:24:05.404
Come on!

1151
01:24:05.447 --> 01:24:07.796
Now, there is
no full rescue team


1152
01:24:07.797 --> 01:24:11.713
coming anytime soon,
not for the next 24 hours.


1153
01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:13.324
-What?
-We can't wait.


1154
01:24:13.325 --> 01:24:16.283
They are gonna come at us
with everything they've got,


1155
01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:18.154
and we're not gonna survive.

1156
01:24:18.155 --> 01:24:21.854
Now, Dele and I managed to get
the power back up on the plane.


1157
01:24:21.855 --> 01:24:23.116
...from the west end.

1158
01:24:23.117 --> 01:24:25.336
We only have one chance.

1159
01:24:25.337 --> 01:24:27.860
And that is me flying us
out of here in this thing.


1160
01:24:27.861 --> 01:24:29.035
-Wait, wait, wait. What?
-No way in hell.


1161
01:24:29.036 --> 01:24:31.211
-I know.
-Listen, listen.


1162
01:24:31.212 --> 01:24:33.518
Listen, listen, listen!

1163
01:24:33.519 --> 01:24:35.215
If I didn't believe
it could be done,


1164
01:24:35.216 --> 01:24:39.350
I would not put you guys
back on that plane.


1165
01:24:39.351 --> 01:24:41.047
I have a daughter.

1166
01:24:41.048 --> 01:24:43.571
I have every intention
of hugging her again


1167
01:24:43.572 --> 01:24:45.138
and making it home.

1168
01:24:45.139 --> 01:24:49.360
And I'm telling you that the
way home is on this plane.


1169
01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:50.796
I've got you this far.

1170
01:24:50.797 --> 01:24:53.799
I just need you to trust me
this one more bit. Okay?


1171
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.496
-All right, preflight checks.
-Copy that.


1172
01:24:55.497 --> 01:24:57.106
-Everybody, follow Mr. Dele.
-Follow me, come on.


1173
01:24:57.107 --> 01:25:01.763
-Okay. All right.
-Come on!


1174
01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:03.069
Come on!

1175
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:04.592
Shellback, how long have I got?

1176
01:25:04.593 --> 01:25:05.767
Two minutes tops.

1177
01:25:05.768 --> 01:25:07.508
Can't be certain
the damage already done


1178
01:25:07.509 --> 01:25:09.118
won't affect
flight characteristics


1179
01:25:09.119 --> 01:25:10.511
or that the engines won't fail.

1180
01:25:10.512 --> 01:25:11.817
Shellback said
it can be done.


1181
01:25:11.818 --> 01:25:12.992
He's the man on the ground.

1182
01:25:12.993 --> 01:25:14.341
Short of proper inspection,

1183
01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:15.473
he's not qualified
to make that determination.


1184
01:25:15.474 --> 01:25:17.083
They're being hunted, Terry.

1185
01:25:17.084 --> 01:25:18.650
And you're talking
about inspections?


1186
01:25:18.651 --> 01:25:20.086
After all they've been through,

1187
01:25:20.087 --> 01:25:21.914
imagine the fallout
if I allow Torrance


1188
01:25:21.915 --> 01:25:24.264
to fly that plane
and incinerate everybody in it.


1189
01:25:24.265 --> 01:25:25.918
Imagine the fallout
if you don't.


1190
01:25:25.919 --> 01:25:27.311
Make sure they get on okay.
Come on.


1191
01:25:27.312 --> 01:25:30.022
-Run, run, run!

1192
01:25:33.883 --> 01:25:36.163
Everybody on.

1193
01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:44.589
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go, Maria.


1194
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:46.310
Ah, fuck.

1195
01:25:47.157 --> 01:25:48.593
We're about to have a lot
of bad guys up our asses.


1196
01:25:48.594 --> 01:25:50.116
I'm gonna need you
to pick up the pace, Cap.


1197
01:25:50.117 --> 01:25:51.422
-All right.
-We've got two convoys


1198
01:25:51.423 --> 01:25:52.640
here and here,

1199
01:25:52.641 --> 01:25:54.642
and it looks like a third
is not far behind.


1200
01:25:54.643 --> 01:25:55.991
All right. I gotta
fix this brake first.


1201
01:25:55.992 --> 01:26:02.672
-You gotta buy me some time.
-Got it.


1202
01:26:04.218 --> 01:26:10.628
Like she said,
let's go. Let's go.


1203
01:26:16.883 --> 01:26:18.187
-Move!
-Bonnie!


1204
01:26:18.188 --> 01:26:20.712
I got it, Captain! Help!

1205
01:26:20.713 --> 01:26:22.853
Keep moving.

1206
01:26:28.285 --> 01:26:31.026
Move! I can't get him.

1207
01:26:31.027 --> 01:26:33.202
Move, move, move!

1208
01:26:33.203 --> 01:26:39.743
Time to go, Captain!
Time to go now!


1209
01:27:00.317 --> 01:27:02.027
Reloading!

1210
01:27:12.982 --> 01:27:14.272
Moving!

1211
01:27:31.770 --> 01:27:35.190
Who are these guys?

1212
01:27:53.458 --> 01:27:56.590
Shellback! Shellback,
I need comms.


1213
01:27:56.591 --> 01:27:59.288
It's already
on the team channel.


1214
01:27:59.289 --> 01:28:01.465
Once I start the engines,
you have two minutes.


1215
01:28:01.466 --> 01:28:05.512
-I'll leave the stairs down.
-Roger that.


1216
01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:07.340
You know I can't get
on that plane with you.


1217
01:28:07.341 --> 01:28:12.476
-Right?
-Yeah, okay. Good luck.


1218
01:28:12.477 --> 01:28:16.177
-You too, my capitan.

1219
01:28:47.076 --> 01:28:49.469
Find a way
to strap him in, Bonnie.


1220
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:51.166
Everybody, stay down, okay?

1221
01:28:51.167 --> 01:28:53.212
Just hang with me
just a little bit longer.


1222
01:28:53.213 --> 01:28:55.257
The cabin doors won't seal
without a reset.


1223
01:28:55.258 --> 01:28:59.827
Keep them open, all of them, okay?
So they're balanced.


1224
01:28:59.828 --> 01:29:02.917
Avionics still shot.
Nothing on screens.


1225
01:29:02.918 --> 01:29:05.180
Checked the hydraulics.
They look good.


1226
01:29:05.181 --> 01:29:06.617
-Okay. APU working?

1227
01:29:06.618 --> 01:29:08.314
-APU working.
-Engaged?


1228
01:29:08.315 --> 01:29:10.142
-Engaged.
-Okay.


1229
01:29:10.143 --> 01:29:12.993
All right, Dele.

1230
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:14.494
Start 'em up.

1231
01:29:14.495 --> 01:29:17.335
Starting engines.

1232
01:29:19.456 --> 01:29:22.067
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.


1233
01:29:22.068 --> 01:29:23.928
-Get down!

1234
01:29:32.774 --> 01:29:34.645
Shit. I'm out of ammo.

1235
01:29:34.646 --> 01:29:40.456
Check our pallet.
Lake, reloading!


1236
01:29:51.445 --> 01:29:53.155
Reloading!

1237
01:30:09.202 --> 01:30:10.333
Shit.

1238
01:30:16.688 --> 01:30:17.905
I need you
with me, Dele.


1239
01:30:17.906 --> 01:30:19.690
-Keep your focus in here.

1240
01:30:19.691 --> 01:30:21.996
Hey, into the live.

1241
01:30:21.997 --> 01:30:26.977
Let's turn this baby around.

1242
01:30:28.196 --> 01:30:31.476
Aim for the pilot!

1243
01:30:37.622 --> 01:30:44.302
They hit our fuel tanks,
we're toast.


1244
01:30:50.069 --> 01:30:51.373
This is Captain Torrance.

1245
01:30:51.374 --> 01:30:53.593
Is anyone there?

1246
01:30:53.594 --> 01:30:55.987
Is anyone there, God damn it?
I'm about to take off.


1247
01:30:55.988 --> 01:30:58.729
Captain, you listen to me.
That plane stays right where she is.


1248
01:30:58.730 --> 01:31:00.165
-Am I understood?
-Captain Torrance,


1249
01:31:00.166 --> 01:31:02.602
my name is David Scarsdale.
Tell me what you need.


1250
01:31:02.603 --> 01:31:04.473
I need directional assistance.

1251
01:31:04.474 --> 01:31:07.389
We have no radar, no nav.
We are fully manual.


1252
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:09.957
I figure we've got
about 300 miles tops.


1253
01:31:09.958 --> 01:31:13.874
Find me a place to land.

1254
01:31:13.875 --> 01:31:15.267
Shellback.

1255
01:31:15.268 --> 01:31:17.443
I need you and your men
on the plane now.


1256
01:31:17.444 --> 01:31:19.750
I'm gonna go as soon
as we make this turn.


1257
01:31:19.751 --> 01:31:22.317
-Get to the plane!
-Check.


1258
01:31:22.318 --> 01:31:24.038
Cover me!

1259
01:31:29.412 --> 01:31:31.282
Let's go!

1260
01:31:39.814 --> 01:31:41.467
Do we have enough road?

1261
01:31:41.468 --> 01:31:43.295
It's gonna have to be.

1262
01:31:43.296 --> 01:31:46.706
Gaspare, move! Move!

1263
01:31:47.953 --> 01:31:50.373
Gaspare, move!

1264
01:31:53.785 --> 01:31:54.959
Gaspare!

1265
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.540
Come on!

1266
01:32:01.836 --> 01:32:03.706
Let's go!

1267
01:32:03.795 --> 01:32:05.491
My wing clear.

1268
01:32:05.492 --> 01:32:08.772
-My wing is clear.

1269
01:32:10.932 --> 01:32:12.411
Can't wait
any longer, Shellback.


1270
01:32:12.412 --> 01:32:14.935
What's your status?

1271
01:32:14.936 --> 01:32:19.916
Go on.
Take us up, Captain.


1272
01:32:31.474 --> 01:32:33.194
Get down!

1273
01:32:52.104 --> 01:32:54.674
What the fuck?

1274
01:33:25.659 --> 01:33:28.079
Full throttle.

1275
01:34:08.571 --> 01:34:10.529
Cap, your shoulder.

1276
01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:12.400
I'm okay.

1277
01:34:16.231 --> 01:34:18.015
We're losing power,
right engine.


1278
01:34:18.016 --> 01:34:19.451
-Shutting it down.
-No!


1279
01:34:19.452 --> 01:34:21.932
We need all the thrust
we can get.


1280
01:34:21.933 --> 01:34:27.938
-We're gonna hit. We're gonna hit.
-Save left engine.


1281
01:34:27.939 --> 01:34:29.519
Come on.

1282
01:34:38.079 --> 01:34:40.646
Lost right engine.
Shut it down now.


1283
01:34:40.647 --> 01:34:43.777
Shutting down two.

1284
01:34:48.829 --> 01:34:50.395
How bad?

1285
01:34:50.396 --> 01:34:52.614
Right wing's trailing edge
is damaged.


1286
01:34:52.615 --> 01:34:55.966
Shit. Okay,
just keep an eye on it.


1287
01:34:55.967 --> 01:34:58.620
This is Trailblazer 119.

1288
01:34:58.621 --> 01:35:00.144
We're airborne.

1289
01:35:00.145 --> 01:35:01.319
Trailblazer 119,

1290
01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.583
reading your air speed
at 135 knots.


1291
01:35:04.584 --> 01:35:05.845
Bordering stall rate.

1292
01:35:05.846 --> 01:35:07.542
This is as fast as she'll go.

1293
01:35:07.543 --> 01:35:09.544
Reading
your altitude at 400 feet.


1294
01:35:09.545 --> 01:35:12.330
You need to take her up to 3,000
or she's not staying up.


1295
01:35:12.331 --> 01:35:14.462
Negative on speed
and altitude.


1296
01:35:14.463 --> 01:35:16.769
119, you need
to take her up now.


1297
01:35:16.770 --> 01:35:18.814
We have no fucking doors.

1298
01:35:18.815 --> 01:35:21.339
We're depressurized,
we're low on fuel


1299
01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:24.124
and we just lost an engine.
Now, don't tell me what I already know.


1300
01:35:24.125 --> 01:35:28.545
Find me a place to land.

1301
01:35:29.130 --> 01:35:31.088
Pulling up lists
of available airfields now.


1302
01:35:31.089 --> 01:35:32.916
Let's get it up on the screen.

1303
01:35:32.917 --> 01:35:34.830
Best option, Siasi Island,

1304
01:35:34.831 --> 01:35:36.658
50 miles due south.

1305
01:35:36.659 --> 01:35:39.531
Adjust your heading to 15 degrees.
There's a small airport there.


1306
01:35:39.532 --> 01:35:40.967
Can you make it?

1307
01:35:40.968 --> 01:35:43.883
We're gonna find out.

1308
01:35:43.884 --> 01:35:48.144
Jungle cleared. Feet wet.

1309
01:35:49.846 --> 01:35:51.891
Have a visual on Siasi.

1310
01:35:51.892 --> 01:35:55.199
Come on. Come on, baby.
Just a little bit more.


1311
01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.320
Lost right-side control.

1312
01:36:01.902 --> 01:36:04.602
Losing altitude.

1313
01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:13.608
Have a visual on Siasi runway.

1314
01:36:13.609 --> 01:36:15.697
Prepare for landing!

1315
01:36:15.698 --> 01:36:21.798
Brace for impact!
Brace for impact!


1316
01:36:30.626 --> 01:36:32.976
Full reverse on one.

1317
01:36:32.977 --> 01:36:35.257
Speed brakes.

1318
01:36:37.546 --> 01:36:42.526
Help me on the brakes, Dele.

1319
01:36:53.127 --> 01:36:54.215
Oh.

1320
01:37:03.485 --> 01:37:04.964
-Are we okay?

1321
01:37:04.965 --> 01:37:06.097
Yes.

1322
01:37:18.109 --> 01:37:19.326
Good job.

1323
01:37:19.327 --> 01:37:25.407
Congratulations, everyone.
Thank you.


1324
01:37:25.725 --> 01:37:27.445
You okay?

1325
01:37:30.121 --> 01:37:33.971
I've had better days.

1326
01:37:34.125 --> 01:37:36.735
One minute at a time, right?

1327
01:37:36.736 --> 01:37:40.586
One minute at a time.

1328
01:38:10.596 --> 01:38:12.075
You're a hell
of a pilot, Captain.


1329
01:38:12.076 --> 01:38:14.381
-Mission accomplished?
-Absolutely.


1330
01:38:14.382 --> 01:38:15.556
You need to see someone?

1331
01:38:15.557 --> 01:38:17.080
Let's keep moving, everybody.

1332
01:38:17.081 --> 01:38:18.298
-You're the captain!
-Come on, man.


1333
01:38:18.299 --> 01:38:20.439
-Oh!
-Yeah.


1334
01:38:33.836 --> 01:38:35.968
Captain, you okay?

1335
01:38:35.969 --> 01:38:37.883
-Yeah, I am.
-Are you okay, Captain?


1336
01:38:37.884 --> 01:38:40.320
Oh, yeah.
No, it looks worse than it is.


1337
01:38:40.321 --> 01:38:42.192
I think it was just a ricochet
or something.


1338
01:38:42.193 --> 01:38:43.281
Oh.

1339
01:38:45.196 --> 01:38:54.073
Hopefully, this is a better layover
than the last one.


1340
01:38:54.074 --> 01:38:56.510
All right, guys.

1341
01:38:56.511 --> 01:38:59.034
-It's been an honor.
-Yeah.


1342
01:38:59.035 --> 01:39:01.341
Good job, Dele.

1343
01:39:01.342 --> 01:39:05.332
Just give me a moment.

1344
01:39:10.569 --> 01:39:11.657
Hey.

1345
01:39:13.093 --> 01:39:14.224
Are you gonna
go to the hospital?


1346
01:39:14.225 --> 01:39:15.665
I will.

1347
01:39:16.749 --> 01:39:17.899
-Okay.

1348
01:39:18.794 --> 01:39:19.926
Hey.

1349
01:39:26.193 --> 01:39:29.108
Thank you so much.

1350
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:30.969
Thank you.

1351
01:41:09.644 --> 01:41:11.950
Hey, it's me.

1352
01:41:11.951 --> 01:41:14.866
I'm coming home.

1353
01:41:14.867 --> 01:41:15.955
Yeah.

1354
01:41:17.913 --> 01:41:26.303
Yeah, you were right.
I'm gonna be a bit late.
