8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.758
It's all coming together.
I can smell it.


9
00:00:39.794 --> 00:00:41.560
Well, your senses are
more attuned than mine.


10
00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:43.596
It still just
smells like dirt to me.


11
00:00:43.631 --> 00:00:45.397
You don't love
the scent of the garden?


12
00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:48.701
It reminds me of
my grandmother's house.


13
00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:52.771
It reminds me of the baseball
diamond when I was a kid.


14
00:00:52.807 --> 00:00:56.775
Five years, never once managed
a hit beyond first base.


15
00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:59.211
Oh, I booked a Michelin-star
chef to come teach the kids


16
00:00:59.247 --> 00:01:00.546
a few dishes next week.

17
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:03.082
And how much is
that going to cost?


18
00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:06.418
Oh, no, I paid in gratitude
and the promise of good press.


19
00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:12.491
ght, I will be back
Now, later in the week.y of.


20
00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:14.793
It's looking amazing.
Bye, Marcus.


21
00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.362
Marcus: Bye.

22
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:23.302
<i>¶ They paved paradise,</i>
<i>put up a parking lot ¶</i>

00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:25.638
<i>¶ Oh, la-la-la ¶</i>

24
00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:27.473
<i>¶ Oh, la... ¶</i>

25
00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:29.275
Hi.
Hi.


26
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.443
How are was it at
the community garden?


27
00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.178
It is so gorgeous.

28
00:01:33.214 --> 00:01:35.414
Still a little rough, though,
but give it two more months,


29
00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:37.950
we're gonna have tomatoes
as big as our hands.


30
00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:39.618
I love it there.

31
00:01:39.654 --> 00:01:41.921
I want to live in
a treehouse above the place.


32
00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:42.955
Tea?

33
00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.625
(phone ringing)

34
00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:49.161
Hi, this is Hayley Hammond.

35
00:01:49.196 --> 00:01:53.365
<i>Hi, Hayley, this is</i>
<i>Sasha Raymond from Zen Forward.</i>


36
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:58.203
Hi, Sasha,
it's so nice to hear from you.


37
00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:00.439
<i>I'm thrilled to let you know</i>
<i>Growing Out is a finalist</i>


38
00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:03.876
<i>for our quarter-million</i>
<i>dollar grant.</i>


39
00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:07.346
Oh, Sasha, thank you so much.
We are so thrilled.


40
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:09.214
<i>Good. My assistant will</i>
<i>reach out in the morning</i>


41
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.450
<i>and we'll set up the first</i>
<i>meeting for the last stage.</i>


42
00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:13.285
Looking forward to it.

43
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:15.988
<i>Just send your eligibility form</i>
<i>and we'll be good to go.</i>


44
00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:17.389
Already on it.

45
00:02:17.425 --> 00:02:18.991
<i>Yes, I see we</i>
<i>have most of them.</i>


46
00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:21.493
<i>We're just waiting for</i>
<i>the office requirement.</i>


47
00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.229
<i>A permitted office space?</i>

48
00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:27.066
Yes, we will take care
of that right away.


49
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:28.467
<i>Wonderful. Talk soon!</i>

50
00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:30.502
Talk soon. Bye.

51
00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:35.674
(both laughing)

52
00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:43.482
We don't have a permit.

53
00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:46.352
What about that person you know
over at the mayor's office?


54
00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:49.989
I still think they're gonna tell
us it's gonna take a few weeks.


55
00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:51.890
We need something faster.

56
00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.196
Come on, Doug. You know
there's no better home for your


57
00:02:57.231 --> 00:02:58.931
charity dollars than right here.

58
00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:00.899
You're helping kids,
it's a no brainer.


59
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.036
You've always
been my rock, Doug,


60
00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:06.705
and we could really use
the boost heading into Q3.


61
00:03:09.276 --> 00:03:11.910
Great. Great, thanks.

62
00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:13.946
I'll have Lucy
draw up the paperwork,


63
00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:16.615
and let's set up
a basketball game for next week.


64
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.884
Okay. Thanks.

65
00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.353
Throw that one on the street.
We have no room for it.


66
00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.855
It's our contacts
from Kids in Coding.


67
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.923
Fine. Scan everything
and burn it.


68
00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.558
(sighing)

69
00:03:26.594 --> 00:03:28.761
I miss our big office
with a view of the river.


70
00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:31.296
Well, since they're
imploding it this week,


71
00:03:31.332 --> 00:03:34.733
the view should be outstanding.
Nowhere to sit, though.


72
00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.568
Oh, can you set up
a basketball game for


73
00:03:36.604 --> 00:03:38.070
me and Doug Purcell next week?

74
00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:39.438
Why? You hate basketball.

75
00:03:39.473 --> 00:03:42.574
I like it.
I'm just terrible at it.


76
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.376
Which means it's a good
opportunity for our donor


77
00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:45.944
to feel like a winner.

78
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.112
Always thinking.

79
00:03:47.148 --> 00:03:48.113
Always.

80
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:49.548
Not helping.

81
00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:50.649
I will help you.

82
00:03:50.684 --> 00:03:51.683
Thank you.

83
00:03:53.254 --> 00:03:58.223
¶

84
00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:00.459
We can't possibly
need an office space.


85
00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:01.794
Marcus works
full-time at the farm


86
00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.395
and Pete is always
out with the kids.


87
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.897
A shared office space.

88
00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:06.899
Where it's loud and full
of people all the time.


89
00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.101
No, they have enclosed offices.
We'll just have to commit for


90
00:04:09.136 --> 00:04:10.669
a few months.
We can handle that.


91
00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:13.138
My dating history
says otherwise.


92
00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:15.607
Hey, can you check to
see if the tea strainer


93
00:04:15.643 --> 00:04:17.609
is in the pile of stuff
in the hall closet?


94
00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:18.610
Mm-hm.

95
00:04:18.646 --> 00:04:19.645
Thanks.

96
00:04:23.284 --> 00:04:24.616
Did you find it?

97
00:04:24.652 --> 00:04:27.286
No, but I did find
this box of letters.


98
00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:30.823
Really?
(laughing)


99
00:04:30.858 --> 00:04:34.460
Oh, this must have been left
from the previous owners.


100
00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:37.262
No, these aren't my letters.

101
00:04:37.298 --> 00:04:38.697
What are they?

102
00:04:42.636 --> 00:04:46.305
They're love letters.

103
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.176
<i>¶ In a way I know</i>
<i>my heart is waking up ¶</i>


104
00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:58.183
<i>¶ As all the walls</i>
<i>come tumbling down ¶</i>


105
00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:05.657
Hayley:
"I find I can think of
nothing but you, sweet Mari."


106
00:05:05.693 --> 00:05:07.593
Should we really
be reading this?


107
00:05:07.628 --> 00:05:09.528
This is someone's
innermost feelings.


108
00:05:09.563 --> 00:05:11.530
This Marisol left
them here, Hayley.


109
00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:13.765
They couldn't have
meant that much to her.


110
00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:15.534
Or she was just
trying to get over him,


111
00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.436
and they clearly
mattered more to him,


112
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:22.040
whoever the "Techie Poet" is.

113
00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:24.676
No. No. If he didn't
even sign his real name,


114
00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:27.513
he forfeits his rights to them.

115
00:05:27.548 --> 00:05:29.314
Okay.

116
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.351
"Because the truth is,
with you I'm at my best.


117
00:05:32.386 --> 00:05:35.687
I want to be the shiniest
version of myself.


118
00:05:35.723 --> 00:05:38.857
I find I stand up straighter,
act kinder,


119
00:05:38.893 --> 00:05:40.292
believe in people more."

120
00:05:40.327 --> 00:05:42.060
He's a little over the top,
don't you think?


121
00:05:42.096 --> 00:05:44.029
No, he's perfect. Keep reading.

122
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:50.202
"I think a lot about the day
when we met and how everything


123
00:05:50.237 --> 00:05:52.538
went so perfectly,

124
00:05:52.573 --> 00:05:54.573
like it was meant to be.

125
00:05:56.377 --> 00:06:00.646
If I could go back in
time today, way before we met,


126
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:05.517
I'd search and find you right
away to form our loving duet."


127
00:06:07.054 --> 00:06:08.020
He rhymes.

128
00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:09.254
He's rhyming.

129
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.356
He's rhyming. He is a poet.

130
00:06:11.392 --> 00:06:12.357
He's so passionate.

131
00:06:12.393 --> 00:06:14.092
So passionate.

132
00:06:15.963 --> 00:06:19.198
<i>¶ I can feel you breathe ¶</i>

133
00:06:21.368 --> 00:06:23.001
Where is this place?

134
00:06:23.037 --> 00:06:25.070
Elisa:
<i>Should be right up by Cypress.</i>


135
00:06:25.105 --> 00:06:26.838
Oh, I found it.

136
00:06:26.874 --> 00:06:29.208
Okay, you're sure this is
Sasha's Raymond's thing?


137
00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:32.544
<i>100%, but rhubarb</i>
<i>and boysenberry only.</i>


138
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.979
Got it. Bye.

139
00:06:41.722 --> 00:06:45.224
Hi, there. I am here looking
for a few flavors that come


140
00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.560
highly recommended.
Rhubarb and boysenberry?


141
00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:50.796
Sure. I only have
a couple of each today.


142
00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:51.797
How many would you like?

143
00:06:51.832 --> 00:06:53.031
I'll take all of them.

144
00:06:53.067 --> 00:06:54.466
I'll wrap those up.

145
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:56.702
Hi! I'm looking for rhubarb jam?

146
00:06:56.737 --> 00:07:00.405
I'm sorry, I just sold all
my jars to this young woman.


147
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:02.774
Hi, I don't know
how many you bought,


148
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.478
but I'd be very appreciative
if I could grab two off you.


149
00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:10.082
(chuckling)
Well, she only has two of them.


150
00:07:10.117 --> 00:07:12.084
Could I possibly trouble you
to switch to another variety?


151
00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:13.485
I'd be happy to pay for yours.

152
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.254
Oh, well, ordinarily,
I would say yes,


153
00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:17.556
but I really do
need these today.


154
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:21.560
So do I. My sister is
having a really bad week


155
00:07:21.595 --> 00:07:23.996
and it's the only thing
that makes her feel better.


156
00:07:24.031 --> 00:07:25.230
Rhubarb jam?

157
00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:26.798
Childhood favorite.

158
00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:29.968
Rhubarb is medicinal.
Not many people know that.


159
00:07:30.004 --> 00:07:34.172
She's sick and it's
the only thing that helps.


160
00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:37.409
Is she sick or
is she having a bad week?


161
00:07:37.444 --> 00:07:39.077
Both?

162
00:07:39.113 --> 00:07:40.679
Well, I sincerely hope
that she feels better.


163
00:07:40.714 --> 00:07:41.913
I really do need that jam.

164
00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:43.282
Do you even have a sister?

165
00:07:43.317 --> 00:07:44.916
No, but I wasn't
lying about the rest.


166
00:07:44.952 --> 00:07:47.319
Why don't you just tell
the jam lady that you need some


167
00:07:47.354 --> 00:07:48.920
for tomorrow and she'll
make you some tonight?


168
00:07:48.956 --> 00:07:50.555
Have a nice day, sir.

169
00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:53.225
(sighing)

170
00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:57.863
Hi, again. What's your
next most popular flavor?


171
00:07:57.898 --> 00:07:59.631
Apricot and blackberry.

172
00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:00.632
A couple of each, please.

173
00:08:00.668 --> 00:08:01.667
Got it.

174
00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:08.373
Thanks so much.

175
00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:16.148
Really?

176
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:20.052
Listen to this part.

177
00:08:20.087 --> 00:08:23.021
"I've never thought of love
as magic, and I don't know.


178
00:08:23.057 --> 00:08:24.656
Love isn't rare.

179
00:08:24.692 --> 00:08:27.492
It doesn't mask
the bad parts of the world.


180
00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:29.728
It changes
the light around them,


181
00:08:29.763 --> 00:08:31.797
makes you see
what's truly important."


182
00:08:31.832 --> 00:08:33.865
But can you still make
your deadline when you are


183
00:08:33.901 --> 00:08:36.134
lost in someone
else's love story?


184
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.803
It does not say that.

185
00:08:37.838 --> 00:08:40.205
No, I know, but we need to
get this paperwork done at


186
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.709
the workshare by five in order
for us to get this grant.


187
00:08:43.744 --> 00:08:45.410
Fine.

188
00:08:45.446 --> 00:08:48.080

192
00:08:56.023 --> 00:08:58.657

Paperwork!

201
00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:22.114
$800 a month still seems steep.

202
00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:24.049
Not if we get the grant.

203
00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:26.518
And if we don't?

204
00:09:26.553 --> 00:09:29.354
I don't understand those words.

205
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.355
Hayley Hammond?

206
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:32.958
Nathan. Hi.

207
00:09:32.993 --> 00:09:34.860
This is my business partner,
Elisa Barr.


208
00:09:34.895 --> 00:09:36.728
I understand you
run a non-profit.


209
00:09:36.764 --> 00:09:39.564
Yeah, we do. We get inner city
kids out into the wilds of


210
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.733
nature and expose them
to gardening and sports


211
00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:44.603
and all sorts of things.
The messier the better.


212
00:09:44.638 --> 00:09:48.106
I love it. Come and let me
show you where you'll be.


213
00:09:48.142 --> 00:09:49.141
Great.

214
00:09:57.084 --> 00:09:58.083
Oh, no.

215
00:09:58.118 --> 00:09:59.718
What?

216
00:09:59.753 --> 00:10:01.920
The woman over there,
I might have tried to hustle her


217
00:10:01.955 --> 00:10:03.722
out of some jam yesterday.

218
00:10:03.757 --> 00:10:05.424
Excuse me?

219
00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:07.426
Well, I tried to get
the rhubarb stuff you suggested


220
00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:11.396
but she'd bought all of it.
So, I might have lied to her


221
00:10:11.432 --> 00:10:13.632
to try and get her
to sell it to me.


222
00:10:16.703 --> 00:10:18.670
Oh, hey there,
new office-sharer.


223
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:21.239
Sorry I lied to your face, but
I'm really a great guy


224
00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:24.976
when jam politics
aren't involved.


225
00:10:25.012 --> 00:10:27.012
Josh:
Maybe if I just...


226
00:10:28.549 --> 00:10:30.382
The wall is glass.

227
00:10:50.304 --> 00:10:52.804
Hayley:
How's your sister doing?


228
00:10:56.376 --> 00:10:57.976
Much better, thank you.

229
00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:00.178
She's expected to make
a full imaginary recovery.


230
00:11:00.214 --> 00:11:04.216
My thoughts are with her
during this very tough time.


231
00:11:04.251 --> 00:11:06.117
How's the jam?

232
00:11:06.153 --> 00:11:07.619
It was a gift.

233
00:11:07.654 --> 00:11:09.187
And you couldn't have
found another gift


234
00:11:09.223 --> 00:11:10.822
and let me have that one?

235
00:11:10.858 --> 00:11:13.225
And you couldn't have told me
the truth in your effort to


236
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.860
convince me?

237
00:11:14.895 --> 00:11:16.862
Fair enough.
Josh Burns, by the way.


238
00:11:16.897 --> 00:11:20.232
Hayley Hammond. Have you been
working here a while?


239
00:11:20.267 --> 00:11:23.568
About a week. Our super cool
loft office got sold to


240
00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:26.204
a developer and is being
pulverized to dust as we speak.


241
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.742
Ah, the ballad of the big city.
Well, my partner, Elisa, and I


242
00:11:30.777 --> 00:11:34.012
we're also here for
the foreseeable future too.


243
00:11:34.047 --> 00:11:35.881
Cool.

244
00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:41.520
Well, if you need
anything in your cube, pod--


245
00:11:41.555 --> 00:11:42.921
Dungeon?

246
00:11:42.956 --> 00:11:45.957
Right. Just let me know.

247
00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:50.095
I will.
Yeah, okay.


248
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.397
Well, it's nice to actually,
finally meet you, Josh.


249
00:11:52.432 --> 00:11:53.698
You, too.

250
00:11:56.203 --> 00:12:06.203
¶

251
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.631
Elisa, you hopeless romantic.

252
00:12:48.989 --> 00:12:51.089
<i>"I know you're away</i>
<i>for work until next week,</i>


253
00:12:51.124 --> 00:12:53.391
<i>but I keep having to stop</i>
<i>myself from buying you</i>


254
00:12:53.427 --> 00:12:55.493
<i>little things.</i>

257
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.634

<i>feel almost like a muscle."</i>


258
00:13:04.037 --> 00:13:07.872
He's sappy, but the guy
is definitely sweet.


259
00:13:45.412 --> 00:13:49.114
Man:
Saw your dad out the other day.
He's looking great.


260
00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:51.116
You'd never know he had
a heart attack less than


261
00:13:51.151 --> 00:13:52.717
six months ago, that's for sure.

262
00:13:52.753 --> 00:13:56.121
He asked if I could
introduce you to anyone nice.


263
00:13:56.156 --> 00:13:59.224
Some things never change.

264
00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:01.393
Did he really say "nice?"
That doesn't sound like him.


265
00:14:01.428 --> 00:14:04.229
His exact words were,

266
00:14:04.264 --> 00:14:07.132
"Do you know any
appropriate girls for Joshua?"


267
00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:08.833
See, that sounds like him.

268
00:14:08.869 --> 00:14:11.670
I promise, I didn't tell him
about the fantastic women


269
00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:13.505
you refuse to let
me set you up with.


270
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.207
Thank you.
He seems to see my singlehood


271
00:14:16.243 --> 00:14:18.743
as some sort of
outstanding transaction.


272
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:22.147
It wouldn't hurt to
get out there again.


273
00:14:22.182 --> 00:14:23.748
I've just got
Mainframe up and running.


274
00:14:23.784 --> 00:14:25.717
I don't have time for
personal relationships.


275
00:14:25.752 --> 00:14:28.486
This is the third non-profit
you've started in the ten years


276
00:14:28.522 --> 00:14:32.057
since we graduated.
It's not a new thing.


277
00:14:32.092 --> 00:14:35.727
If you don't find time,
it won't magically appear.


278
00:14:35.762 --> 00:14:37.929
Who says I need anything more?

279
00:14:37.964 --> 00:14:42.934
I'm just saying,
you can't marry your job.


280
00:14:42.969 --> 00:14:45.770
Maybe I'll get married,
maybe I won't,


281
00:14:45.806 --> 00:14:48.073
but I'm more concerned with
being happy than trying to


282
00:14:48.108 --> 00:14:51.042
fulfill someone else's
idea of perfection.


283
00:14:51.078 --> 00:14:52.711
But are you happy?

284
00:14:55.649 --> 00:14:57.215
You really have been
talking to my dad.


285
00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.284
(laughing)

286
00:15:01.421 --> 00:15:05.256
Hah! They got you too!
Did anything juicy happen?


287
00:15:05.292 --> 00:15:07.759
They hiked Machu Picchu,
they talked about having babies,


288
00:15:07.794 --> 00:15:09.394
they even looked at
houses outside the city,


289
00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:10.962
but it's so depressing.

290
00:15:10.997 --> 00:15:14.265
Why? How do we know
they didn't end up together?


291
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:15.300
Read.

292
00:15:17.437 --> 00:15:20.872
"I love seeing you in the ring.
I remember my grandmother


293
00:15:20.907 --> 00:15:23.374
packing it away
and thinking it was sweet..."

Techie Poet:
<i>"But not understanding</i>
<i>the importance of it all.</i>


295

296
00:15:28.648 --> 00:15:30.749
See?

297
00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:32.984
What? They got engaged.

298
00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:36.121
The engagement obviously
meant more to him.


299
00:15:36.156 --> 00:15:39.124
Our poor boyfriend's
gonna have his heart broken.


300
00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:40.725
A, you don't know that

301
00:15:40.761 --> 00:15:43.995
and B, now we have equal
ownership over this romance?


302
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.131
Yes, yes. I am totally hooked.

303
00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:48.133
Well, keep reading. I want to
know what happens next.


304
00:15:48.168 --> 00:15:50.902
Can we do it tomorrow?
I want to at least think that


305
00:15:50.937 --> 00:15:53.571
they ended up together
just for a few more hours.


306
00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:56.975
Maybe they did. Maybe they
bought one of those houses


307
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.810
and that's why
the woman sold the condo.


308
00:16:00.514 --> 00:16:03.481
Do you think she would've
left these letters here


309
00:16:03.517 --> 00:16:05.483
if this had a happy ending?

310
00:16:15.128 --> 00:16:16.961
You have got to be kidding me.

311
00:16:18.732 --> 00:16:20.832
So, that explains
the rhubarb jam.


312
00:16:20.867 --> 00:16:22.634
Why didn't you tell me
why you needed it


313
00:16:22.669 --> 00:16:24.035
when you met me
the first time?


314
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.037
Would you have given
it to me if I had?


315
00:16:26.072 --> 00:16:27.272
Absolutely not.

316
00:16:27.307 --> 00:16:29.374
I didn't think so.

317
00:16:29.409 --> 00:16:31.176
I know you from somewhere.

318
00:16:31.211 --> 00:16:33.178
Did you do that Ted X about
communing with nature?


319
00:16:33.213 --> 00:16:35.780
Yes, I did, and I take it
you're more of an indoor guy?


320
00:16:35.816 --> 00:16:38.183
I run and play sports,
but, yeah, I'm a techie,


321
00:16:38.218 --> 00:16:41.186
so the sun kind of gets in the
way of me playing on my tablet.


322
00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:43.354
Oh, the pesky sun,
providing so much vitamin D


323
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.789
and electricity.

324
00:16:44.825 --> 00:16:45.957
Josh and Hayley.

325
00:16:45.992 --> 00:16:47.125
Both:
Hey.


326
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.226
I'm Sasha Raymond.

327
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:49.994
Hi.
Nice to meet you, Sasha.


328
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.297
Nice to meet you.
So nice to meet you.


329
00:16:52.332 --> 00:16:54.499
You know each other?

330
00:16:54.534 --> 00:16:56.067
Um.

331
00:16:56.102 --> 00:16:59.704
Oh, well, Hayley is
the co-founder of Growing Out,


332
00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:01.806
which takes city kiddos
outside to experience


333
00:17:01.842 --> 00:17:04.676
farms and fresh air,
and Josh is the head


334
00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:07.745
of Mainframe, which takes kids
and gives them the opportunity


335
00:17:07.781 --> 00:17:09.480
to work and play
with the latest tech.


336
00:17:09.516 --> 00:17:11.416
Mm-hm.

337
00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:14.586
Let's go inside and get to
know each other better.


338
00:17:14.621 --> 00:17:16.020
Great.

339
00:17:17.724 --> 00:17:20.024
Josh:
So, really, we've been pushing
beyond the standard practice


340
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.759
of "homework on the tablet"
for kids.


341
00:17:21.795 --> 00:17:23.261
It's pretty limiting.

342
00:17:23.296 --> 00:17:27.365
Interesting. What are your
thoughts on that, Hayley?


343
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.035
Well, I can give you thirty
different opinions on fertilizer


344
00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:33.538
or how children needing sunshine
to help calibrate their eyes,


345
00:17:33.573 --> 00:17:37.175
but I don't really know a lot
about technology and kids.


346
00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.545
Alright, well, that answers
my questions for now.


347
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.747
Although, I know I'll have
a million of them pop up


348
00:17:42.782 --> 00:17:46.351
soon enough. I want this
to be a simple process.


349
00:17:46.386 --> 00:17:48.286
You both have until
Friday to put together


350
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:52.023
a full visual proposal,
and then we will assemble here,


351
00:17:52.058 --> 00:17:56.628
the five of us, and explore your
non-profit's futures together.


352
00:17:56.663 --> 00:17:58.763
I hope to fund pretty
quickly after that.


353
00:17:58.798 --> 00:18:00.899
Mainframe is beyond
excited to be in the mix.


354
00:18:00.934 --> 00:18:03.401
Zen Forward is such
an industry leader,


355
00:18:03.436 --> 00:18:04.469
it'd be great synergy.

356
00:18:04.504 --> 00:18:06.404
Well, I'm looking forward to it.

357
00:18:06.439 --> 00:18:09.040
It is incredible that a tech
company is looking to preserve


358
00:18:09.075 --> 00:18:11.376
these fundamental
parts of our humanity.


359
00:18:11.411 --> 00:18:14.212
Of course. We love what you do.

360
00:18:14.247 --> 00:18:17.949
Alright, I guess we will put
together a proposal time.


361
00:18:17.984 --> 00:18:20.618
We very much look forward
to seeing you again very soon.


362
00:18:20.654 --> 00:18:22.086
Thank you.
Thank you so much.


363
00:18:22.122 --> 00:18:25.290
And by the way,
I really appreciate the gifts


364
00:18:25.325 --> 00:18:27.325
from both of you.
I guess my addiction to


365
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.961
Mary Ann's Jams
is known far and wide.


366
00:18:29.996 --> 00:18:31.596
(both chuckling)

367
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:38.136
Alright, um, you headed
back to the office?


368
00:18:38.171 --> 00:18:40.505
We could share a car.

369
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.106
I really don't think
we should be fraternizing


370
00:18:42.142 --> 00:18:43.641
with the competition.

371
00:18:43.677 --> 00:18:47.946
I understand why you might
be worried, but I'm not.


372
00:18:47.981 --> 00:18:49.647
I'm not worried.

373
00:18:49.683 --> 00:18:51.849
Oh, and I meant to tell you.
Sasha, she hates apricots


374
00:18:51.885 --> 00:18:53.651
and she's allergic
to blackberries.


375
00:18:53.687 --> 00:18:55.353
(sighing)
Of course she is.


376
00:18:55.388 --> 00:18:56.955
And really, synergy?

377
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.990
Yes, synergy, and you?

378
00:18:59.025 --> 00:19:01.426
Kids needing their eyes
calibrated? What is that?


379
00:19:01.461 --> 00:19:03.428
It's true.
You should look it up.


380
00:19:03.463 --> 00:19:04.862
See you back at the cube.

381
00:19:13.106 --> 00:19:15.273
Okay, we need to hit the ground
running with this pitch.


382
00:19:15.308 --> 00:19:17.108
Set up a time with
Marcus and the kids.


383
00:19:17.143 --> 00:19:19.944
Thursday is a farm field trip,
so maybe we can tag along.


384
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.782
Although, I think that's gonna
be too late for the turnaround.


385
00:19:24.818 --> 00:19:26.351
(sniffling)

386
00:19:26.386 --> 00:19:28.419
Part of me desperately wants to
know what happens to the Poet


387
00:19:28.455 --> 00:19:30.521
and the other part
knows that we need


388
00:19:30.557 --> 00:19:31.689
to set everything up
immediately.


389
00:19:31.725 --> 00:19:33.091
It's so sad!

390
00:19:33.126 --> 00:19:36.961
Oh. Oh, honey.

391
00:19:36.997 --> 00:19:38.196
What is?

392
00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:40.231
Read it!

393
00:19:44.637 --> 00:19:49.374
"How have you evaporated
from my life without a trace?


394
00:19:49.409 --> 00:19:53.277
Techie Poet:
<i>I call and you don't answer.</i>
<i>You always answer.</i>


395
00:19:53.313 --> 00:19:55.046
<i>I was worried enough</i>
<i>to stop by your condo,</i>


396
00:19:55.081 --> 00:19:58.149
<i>but you never</i>
<i>answered the door.</i>


397
00:19:58.184 --> 00:20:00.184
<i>You know I'm not</i>
<i>the one to barge right in.</i>


398
00:20:01.721 --> 00:20:03.955
Hey. So, I was thinking,
given the situation--


399
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.324
Elisa, this is Josh Burns.
He belongs to the office


400
00:20:06.359 --> 00:20:08.659
five yards that way,
and he so happens to be


401
00:20:08.695 --> 00:20:10.528
our competition for
the Zen Forward grant.


402
00:20:10.563 --> 00:20:13.331
Oh, wow, um, hi.

403
00:20:13.366 --> 00:20:15.033
Did I come at a bad time?

404
00:20:15.068 --> 00:20:17.568
No, but knocking
is generally appreciated.


405
00:20:17.604 --> 00:20:19.003
Right. Sorry.

406
00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:20.238
(knocking)

407
00:20:20.273 --> 00:20:22.740
(chuckling)
So given the situation...


408
00:20:22.776 --> 00:20:24.976
Oh, I was going to suggest
no spying.


409
00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:27.211
Because we're going to win
the grant.


410
00:20:27.247 --> 00:20:28.846
Mainframe wins most of what
we go after.


411
00:20:28.882 --> 00:20:30.481
Well, that's because
you've never competed


412
00:20:30.517 --> 00:20:31.849
against us before.

413
00:20:31.885 --> 00:20:33.584
We don't lose, either.

414
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.852
So, no spying?

415
00:20:34.888 --> 00:20:36.654
We wouldn't.
We don't need to.


416
00:20:36.689 --> 00:20:39.724
Great! Nice to meet you, Elisa.

417
00:20:42.395 --> 00:20:43.728
(laughing)

418
00:20:43.763 --> 00:20:47.265
(water trickling)

419
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.167
I hear you're pitching
at Zen Forward.


420
00:20:49.202 --> 00:20:50.768
Patty Sullivan's
on the board,


421
00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:52.537
I could put in
a good word for you.


422
00:20:52.572 --> 00:20:54.372
Mm, a good word, sure,
but no more than that.


423
00:20:54.407 --> 00:20:56.040
We're doing quite well
on our own.


424
00:20:56.076 --> 00:20:57.375
I know you are.

425
00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.777
I'm not trying to interfere,
I just want to help.


426
00:20:59.813 --> 00:21:01.279
Oh, then can you lend me

427
00:21:01.314 --> 00:21:02.914
some of the seeds
from your lavender garden?


428
00:21:02.949 --> 00:21:04.215
There's this little girl,

429
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.950
the program director said
she wants to use them


430
00:21:05.985 --> 00:21:09.120
to help her make this fancy
lemonade she saw on YouTube.


431
00:21:09.155 --> 00:21:10.721
Aw, done.

432
00:21:10.757 --> 00:21:12.290
I'll bring them over
the next time I see you.


433
00:21:12.325 --> 00:21:14.058
So, tomorrow?

434
00:21:14.094 --> 00:21:16.928
You know, you say that
like it's a bad thing.


435
00:21:16.963 --> 00:21:19.063
No, not at all.

436
00:21:19.099 --> 00:21:22.433
It's just we're two single
ladies in a big city, alone.


437
00:21:22.469 --> 00:21:23.701
(laughing)

438
00:21:23.736 --> 00:21:25.236
You know, we have to stick
together.


439
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:27.705
Well, there's three of us,
including Elisa. Three.


440
00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.074
How is she?
How's she doing?


441
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.809
How does she like
her new apartment?


442
00:21:31.845 --> 00:21:33.444
It's Elisa.

443
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.113
She doesn't really talk
about stuff like that.


444
00:21:35.148 --> 00:21:36.981
You know, everything is fine,
she can manage.


445
00:21:37.016 --> 00:21:38.783
She doesn't need help.

446
00:21:38.818 --> 00:21:41.953
I slipped her doorman a 20
and a coffee cake


447
00:21:41.988 --> 00:21:43.955
just to keep a special eye
on her.


448
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.257
I can't imagine what you would
do if I had a doorman.


449
00:21:46.292 --> 00:21:49.460
And about that, why are you
still living in a walk-up?


450
00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:51.429
It's what I can afford.

451
00:21:51.464 --> 00:21:53.664
And I am proud of how hard
I worked to get it.


452
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.167
And for the millionth time,
it's in a great neighborhood.


453
00:21:56.202 --> 00:21:59.270
Well, if I can't interfere
in your work life


454
00:21:59.305 --> 00:22:00.738
and your home life,

455
00:22:00.773 --> 00:22:02.607
I'm just going to have to start
stalking your love life.


456
00:22:02.642 --> 00:22:05.443
Okay, great,
we can discuss my love life,


457
00:22:05.478 --> 00:22:07.512
which basically consists of me

458
00:22:07.547 --> 00:22:11.315
living vicariously through
other people's love lives.


459
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:15.186
Which reminds me, what is this
I'm hearing about you


460
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:19.257
and the guy who runs
the butcher shop downtown?


461
00:22:19.292 --> 00:22:21.025
Mom!

462
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.793
Oh!

463
00:22:22.829 --> 00:22:24.862
(laughing)

464
00:22:24.898 --> 00:22:28.032
But why aren't you dating?

465
00:22:28.067 --> 00:22:30.201
What about that guy that was
doing the morning show?


466
00:22:30.236 --> 00:22:31.836
Oh, he worked really
weird hours.


467
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:33.471
It was hard to make plans.

468
00:22:33.506 --> 00:22:34.939
You're never going to meet
anyone


469
00:22:34.974 --> 00:22:37.008
if you keep inventing problems.

470
00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:40.545
Okay, it wasn't the hours.

471
00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:44.882
There just wasn't enough there
to justify working around them.


472
00:22:44.918 --> 00:22:47.685
And sometimes, you have to give
people a chance


473
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.153
to make it worth the effort.

474
00:22:49.189 --> 00:22:52.223
No, I give plenty of people
plenty of chances.


475
00:22:52.258 --> 00:22:54.025
I'm just...

476
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.726
I'm not into anyone right now.

477
00:22:55.762 --> 00:22:57.995
And that's what concerns me.

478
00:22:58.031 --> 00:22:59.497
Everything concerns you.

479
00:22:59.532 --> 00:23:01.065
You think my windows
are too thin.


480
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.834
You know,
it's perfectly natural


481
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.504
to still feel heartbreak
after a year.


482
00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:08.472
I know,

483
00:23:08.508 --> 00:23:11.142
but I'm over Daniel. I am.

484
00:23:11.177 --> 00:23:12.643
It does get better,

485
00:23:12.679 --> 00:23:14.879
especially when the real thing
comes along.


486
00:23:14.914 --> 00:23:18.015
You are worse than Elisa!

487
00:23:18.051 --> 00:23:21.319
And your windows do need to be
replaced with double-paned.


488
00:23:21.354 --> 00:23:23.688
(laughing) Okay!

489
00:23:23.723 --> 00:23:25.356
Can we just go back to talking

490
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:27.158
about the very good-looking
butcher?


491
00:23:28.761 --> 00:23:33.531
since Dad passed.15 years

492
00:23:33.566 --> 00:23:35.266
I want you to be happy.

493
00:23:35.301 --> 00:23:38.436
So, if you meet a good-looking
guy that's nice,


494
00:23:38.471 --> 00:23:40.371
I want to hear about it.

Hayley:
I thought you had a date.


497
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:47.211
I did, but he's a dog-walker.

498
00:23:47.247 --> 00:23:50.381
He had to leave by 8 to,
you know, walk all the dogs.


499
00:23:50.416 --> 00:23:51.616
Oh!

500
00:23:51.651 --> 00:23:53.150
You took the letters!

501
00:23:53.186 --> 00:23:54.652
What?

502
00:23:54.687 --> 00:23:56.587
Oh, I have the last couple.

503
00:23:56.623 --> 00:23:58.089
I thought you were allergic
to dogs.


504
00:23:58.124 --> 00:24:02.526
Well, they're not his dogs,
so...


505
00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:07.598
The last two.

506
00:24:11.304 --> 00:24:13.237
It's short.

507
00:24:13.273 --> 00:24:16.140
"I saw your brother at the movie
theater the other night.


508
00:24:16.175 --> 00:24:18.242
"He came over
and gave me a hug,


509
00:24:18.278 --> 00:24:20.311
said he was
sorry for what happened."

00:24:38.231 --> 00:24:40.364
It is crazy, right?

515
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.501
Who would do that?

516
00:24:43.536 --> 00:24:46.037
Who would do this?

<i>the chains of poverty.</i>


519
00:24:57.517 --> 00:25:00.017
Have you seen the promo video
for last year's grant recipient?


520
00:25:00.053 --> 00:25:01.519
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

521
00:25:01.554 --> 00:25:03.454
We don't have anything
like that.


522
00:25:03.489 --> 00:25:05.723
How much design money is left?

523
00:25:05.758 --> 00:25:08.526
Five grand or so.

524
00:25:08.561 --> 00:25:11.395
Do you want to call Devin Flores
and check and see if he's free?


525
00:25:11.431 --> 00:25:13.864
Yes! See if he can meet
for lunch tomorrow.


526
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.233
What happened to last year's
grant recipient?


527
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:17.802
Why aren't they in the running?

528
00:25:17.837 --> 00:25:20.671
They were fully funded
by a few Fortune 500s.


529
00:25:20.707 --> 00:25:22.907
Ten million or so.

530
00:25:22.942 --> 00:25:26.877
Okay, maybe we can find a little
more money for graphics.


531
00:25:26.913 --> 00:25:28.979
Right.

532
00:25:29.015 --> 00:25:30.381
We have to mail it back to him,

533
00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:32.016
both for sentimental reasons

534
00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:35.353
and because I'm pretty sure
that it cost a lot of money.


535
00:25:35.388 --> 00:25:38.055
And then, he'll fall in love
with your wit and charm,


536
00:25:38.091 --> 00:25:40.825
and you'll meet right here
in real life,


537
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.226
under a gently falling rain.

538
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:44.695
'l latst sight,
primedyo words.


539
00:25:44.731 --> 00:25:46.931
Okay, or he'll just say
"thank you so much"


540
00:25:46.966 --> 00:25:48.265
and we'll never speak again

541
00:25:48.301 --> 00:25:50.768
because, you know,
he's like a total stranger.


542
00:25:50.803 --> 00:25:52.870
After all of this,
you don't believe in love?


543
00:25:52.905 --> 00:25:55.239
After all of this,
you still do?


544
00:25:55.274 --> 00:25:59.710
Besides, I am already
ahead of you.


545
00:26:00.947 --> 00:26:02.546
What did you say?

546
00:26:02.582 --> 00:26:04.615
I asked if he wanted it back.

547
00:26:07.453 --> 00:26:09.954

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.119
<i>You don't know me.</i>

<i>I have no way of knowing</i>

00:26:56.936 --> 00:26:59.770
<i>or even that you've truly</i>

558
00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:01.405
<i>Nothing would make me happier</i>

559
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:03.808
<i>than knowing the two of you</i>

<i>If you'd like the letters</i>
<i>and gift back,</i>

<i>Signed, Your Granola</i>
<i>Fairy Godmother.</i>


563
00:27:29.802 --> 00:27:33.304
The type of graphics you're
talking about aren't cheap.


564
00:27:33.339 --> 00:27:37.007
On this time frame, I'll need
to bring an animator in


565
00:27:37.043 --> 00:27:38.876
to take the more intensive code.

566
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:42.346
I get that,
but cheap doesn't win grants.


567
00:27:42.381 --> 00:27:45.483
I want the best animations
we can get, within reason.


568
00:27:45.518 --> 00:27:47.051
Okay.

569
00:27:49.822 --> 00:27:51.989
Is everything okay, man?

570
00:27:52.024 --> 00:27:53.624
I've never seen you
this worried about a pitch.


571
00:27:53.659 --> 00:27:55.726
Oh, everything's fine.

572
00:27:55.761 --> 00:27:57.795
Thank you, though.

573
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.864
Just, there's some other
things going on,


574
00:27:59.899 --> 00:28:02.132
which is why I really want
to nail this proposal.


575
00:28:02.168 --> 00:28:04.134
Do you have
an animator you trust?


576
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.171
Uh, yeah, yeah. Here.

577
00:28:07.206 --> 00:28:09.073
No animation.

578
00:28:09.108 --> 00:28:10.975
Have you seen the video last
year's winners put out?


579
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.011
I did, and they're working
on food-supply chains


580
00:28:14.046 --> 00:28:17.147
to third-world countries,
their graphics make sense.


581
00:28:17.183 --> 00:28:21.051
But we deal with children -
grassroot, organic efforts.


582
00:28:21.087 --> 00:28:23.320
I want them on screen
as much as possible.


583
00:28:23.356 --> 00:28:24.722
Do we know a videographer?

584
00:28:24.757 --> 00:28:26.423
I don't think a photographer's
going to be enough.


585
00:28:26.459 --> 00:28:27.758
I'll get on the phone.

586
00:28:27.793 --> 00:28:29.693
Okay, I'm going to head down
to the mayor's office


587
00:28:29.729 --> 00:28:32.096
and see if I can get anyone on
camera willing to vouch for us.


588
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:33.497
Good luck.

589
00:28:33.533 --> 00:28:35.366
You got this.

590
00:28:35.401 --> 00:28:37.434
I got this!

591
00:28:43.242 --> 00:28:45.075
How's the pitch coming?

592
00:28:45.111 --> 00:28:46.343
Nearly done.

593
00:28:46.379 --> 00:28:48.512
Hmm, are you trying to
intimidate me?


594
00:28:48.548 --> 00:28:49.880
Are you intimidated?

595
00:28:49.916 --> 00:28:52.416
No such luck.

596
00:28:54.153 --> 00:28:55.386
No spying!

597
00:28:55.421 --> 00:28:56.887
I'm not.

598
00:29:11.704 --> 00:29:14.838
You think this girl found your
grandmother's engagement ring?


599
00:29:14.874 --> 00:29:16.640
Marisol wasn't big into gifts,

600
00:29:16.676 --> 00:29:18.142
so I can't imagine what else
it could be.


601
00:29:18.177 --> 00:29:19.944
You're going to ask for it back,
right?


602
00:29:19.979 --> 00:29:21.312
Of course.

603
00:29:21.347 --> 00:29:22.546
But honestly, I can't believe

604
00:29:22.582 --> 00:29:24.014
she left it in the condo
when she moved.


605
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:25.816
Who does that?

606
00:29:25.851 --> 00:29:29.853
It's taken you nearly a year
to get over her, Josh.


607
00:29:29.889 --> 00:29:32.856
Don't-don't let this drag
you back down.


608
00:29:32.892 --> 00:29:34.792
I just don't want to think
about her.


609
00:29:34.827 --> 00:29:37.628
I want to take the non-profit,
turn it into a juggernaut,


610
00:29:37.663 --> 00:29:38.996
and forget she ever existed.

611
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:41.865
Except that's not who you are.

612
00:29:44.036 --> 00:29:47.004
Maybe it would be easier
if I knew what happened.


613
00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:49.239
Ghosting me after three years?

614
00:29:49.275 --> 00:29:51.241
It really messed with my head.

615
00:29:51.277 --> 00:29:53.310
Unless this Granola Fairy woman

616
00:29:53.346 --> 00:29:55.913
also found un-mailed letters
from Marisol,


617
00:29:55.948 --> 00:29:59.049
explaining in detail
what went wrong


618
00:29:59.085 --> 00:30:00.884
and why she ran away,

619
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.886
you're never going to get the
kind of closure that you want.


620
00:30:02.922 --> 00:30:04.989
Write this woman back.

621
00:30:05.024 --> 00:30:08.325
Let her return your family ring.
Put Marisol behind you.


622
00:30:08.361 --> 00:30:10.427
Easier said than done.

623
00:30:11.864 --> 00:30:13.063
One more game?

624
00:30:13.099 --> 00:30:14.665
(groaning)

625
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.100
I should head home.

626
00:30:16.135 --> 00:30:17.768
Same time next week?

627
00:30:17.803 --> 00:30:20.304
You got it.

628
00:30:25.778 --> 00:30:27.978
(sighing)

629
00:30:36.255 --> 00:30:41.258
<i>¶</i>

630
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.740
Well, that was fast.

631
00:31:03.616 --> 00:31:06.216
(phone ringing)

632
00:31:06.252 --> 00:31:07.718
Elisa:
<i>Are you alive?</i>


633
00:31:07.753 --> 00:31:09.720
<i>Because if you are, it's too</i>
<i>early to be calling me.</i>


634
00:31:09.755 --> 00:31:11.955
I am, and it's after 10 a.m.,
so you should be awake.


635
00:31:11.991 --> 00:31:13.824
<i>I was up till three.</i>

636
00:31:13.859 --> 00:31:16.260
There's a letter
from the poet guy.


637
00:31:16.295 --> 00:31:18.462
<i>I'll be across the street</i>
<i>in two minutes.</i>


638
00:31:18.497 --> 00:31:20.631
<i>Wait, no.</i>
<i>This needs croissants.</i>


639
00:31:20.666 --> 00:31:21.999
<i>Meet me downstairs</i>
<i>in five.</i>


640
00:31:22.034 --> 00:31:23.300
Fifteen.
<i>Ten.</i>


641
00:31:23.335 --> 00:31:24.835
Deal! (squealing)

642
00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:36.080
"Hello, my Fairy Godmother!

643
00:31:36.115 --> 00:31:38.849
"What an unexpected letter
to receive.


644
00:31:38.884 --> 00:31:42.086
"I fear you have me at something
of a disadvantage.


645
00:31:42.121 --> 00:31:44.421
"It seems you know
so much about me


646
00:31:44.457 --> 00:31:46.757
and I know nothing about you."

647
00:31:46.792 --> 00:31:49.293
Reading his words again,

648
00:31:49.328 --> 00:31:52.329
he sounds like a runaway
from a Victorian-era drama.


649
00:31:52.364 --> 00:31:53.797
(laughing)

650
00:31:53.833 --> 00:31:55.466
Shh, you're ruining it!

651
00:31:55.501 --> 00:31:57.034
<i>I'm hoping your letter means</i>

652
00:31:57.069 --> 00:31:59.503
<i>you've found my grandmother's</i>
<i>engagement ring.</i>


653
00:31:59.538 --> 00:32:01.105
<i>A solitaire,</i>

654
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.540
<i>which is all I really know</i>
<i>about those kinds of things.</i>


655
00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:06.076
<i>The letters, you can keep.</i>

656
00:32:16.255 --> 00:32:17.788
<i>Burn them in a ceremony,</i>

657
00:32:17.823 --> 00:32:20.891
<i>write a Broadway musical,</i>
<i>whatever you like.</i>


658
00:32:20.926 --> 00:32:23.627
<i>They belong to a different</i>
<i>version of this poet.</i>


659
00:32:23.662 --> 00:32:27.397
<i>But the ring, well, I would</i>
<i>appreciate that back.</i>


660
00:32:27.433 --> 00:32:29.833
<i>Your ever-grateful Techie Poet.</i>

661
00:32:31.403 --> 00:32:35.572
Oh, my goodness, the ring,
it was his grandmother's?


662
00:32:35.608 --> 00:32:38.242
You have to fall in love with
this man and heal his heart.


663
00:32:38.277 --> 00:32:40.210
Or maybe he's already moved on.

664
00:32:40.246 --> 00:32:42.980
Maybe he's with someone else, or
maybe he's even become a monk.


665
00:32:43.015 --> 00:32:44.815
I'm telling you, this is fate.

666
00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.785
Okay, slow your roll,
Scarlett O'Hara.


667
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.820
We're just gonna get the ring
back to the poor guy,


668
00:32:49.855 --> 00:32:52.990
and that is all
I am signing up for.


669
00:32:53.025 --> 00:32:54.725
(giggling)

670
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.461
I have to go.

671
00:32:57.496 --> 00:33:00.931
Are you sure you don't want
to go to the movies


672
00:33:00.966 --> 00:33:02.299
with me and Candace?

673
00:33:02.334 --> 00:33:03.967
You know I love a reason
to escape,


674
00:33:04.003 --> 00:33:06.236
but I have errands to run.

675
00:33:06.272 --> 00:33:08.305
You're adulting too hard
for a Saturday.


676
00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.440
Hmm, possibly.
Tell Candace I say hi.


677
00:33:10.476 --> 00:33:11.842
Will do.

678
00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:30.294
(typing)

679
00:33:39.038 --> 00:33:42.372
Following 400 celebs,
followed by three bots.


680
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.310
Techie Poet:
<i>"The crux of the issue</i>
<i>as I see it</i>


681
00:33:46.345 --> 00:33:48.178
<i>"is that humanity</i>
<i>is largely blind."</i>


682
00:33:48.214 --> 00:33:50.714
Oh, it's so you!

683
00:33:55.154 --> 00:33:56.653
(beeping)

684
00:33:56.689 --> 00:33:58.021
Hayley:
<i>Hey there.</i>


685
00:33:58.057 --> 00:33:59.656
<i>This is kind of a long shot,</i>

686
00:33:59.692 --> 00:34:02.559
<i>but would you happen to be the</i>
<i>Techie Poet of Marisol lore?</i>


687
00:34:02.595 --> 00:34:05.562
Well, hello.

688
00:34:05.598 --> 00:34:07.965
<i>What are the workforce</i>
<i>challenges we'll face</i>


689
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.633
<i>in the next 15 years?</i>

690
00:34:09.668 --> 00:34:11.635
<i>Automation, AI.</i>

691
00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.404
<i>Our workers need to be</i>
<i>prepared.</i>


692
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.206
You're talking about children.

693
00:34:16.242 --> 00:34:18.475
<i>Kids are capable of</i>
<i>so much more</i>


694
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:19.743
<i>than we give them credit for.</i>

695
00:34:19.778 --> 00:34:22.012
<i>Their imaginations</i>
<i>can manifest things</i>


696
00:34:22.047 --> 00:34:24.147
<i>that we, as adults,</i>
<i>can't even fathom.</i>


697
00:34:24.183 --> 00:34:26.516
<i>And the best way to help them</i>

698
00:34:26.552 --> 00:34:29.152
<i>is to give them the tools</i>
<i>they need to create.</i>


699
00:34:29.188 --> 00:34:31.688
Fair point, I guess.

700
00:34:34.927 --> 00:34:37.027
I've done a thing.

701
00:34:37.062 --> 00:34:38.595
You know the Techie Poet guy?

702
00:34:38.631 --> 00:34:41.398
As much as I know him
not at all, yes.


703
00:34:41.433 --> 00:34:43.333
You've been writing him.

704
00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:45.269
I'm pretty sure
that I haven't been.


705
00:34:45.304 --> 00:34:47.337
Well, I have, but as you.

706
00:34:47.373 --> 00:34:49.573
It seems our friend has a hidden
little Twitter account.


707
00:34:49.608 --> 00:34:52.109
And so do you now!

708
00:34:54.747 --> 00:34:56.546
"Hey there.
This is kind of a long shot,


709
00:34:56.582 --> 00:34:58.782
but would you happen to be the
Techie Poet of Marisol lore?"


710
00:34:58.817 --> 00:35:01.685
"You found me! Clever!
Not so truly analog, are we?"


711
00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.122
"Says the Techie Poet who wrote
his girlfriend via snail mail."


712
00:35:05.157 --> 00:35:08.025
You have been writing him
this whole day?


713
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.761
He's charming,
and kind of adorable.


714
00:35:10.796 --> 00:35:12.396
Then, you should be
the Fairy Godmother.


715
00:35:12.431 --> 00:35:13.931
You're so crazy about
this whole story.


716
00:35:13.966 --> 00:35:15.866
He's not my type,
but he is yours.


717
00:35:15.901 --> 00:35:17.267
If nice is not your type,

718
00:35:17.303 --> 00:35:18.702
we need to have a serious
conversation.


719
00:35:18.737 --> 00:35:20.737
I'm dating the dog-walker.

720
00:35:20.773 --> 00:35:22.706
No! No, please, marry the poet,

721
00:35:22.741 --> 00:35:24.641
and live in nineteenth-century
bliss.


722
00:35:24.677 --> 00:35:26.243
I'll knit you an afghan
detailing your love.


723
00:35:27.613 --> 00:35:30.714
(phone dinging)

724
00:35:30.749 --> 00:35:32.582
He's talking.

725
00:35:32.618 --> 00:35:34.217
He says...

726
00:35:34.253 --> 00:35:35.953
Josh:
<i>I need you to tell me</i>
<i>the truth here.</i>


727
00:35:35.988 --> 00:35:37.321
<i>How horrible was it</i>

728
00:35:37.356 --> 00:35:39.456
<i>reading my sappy,</i>
<i>overemotional letters?</i>


729
00:35:39.491 --> 00:35:41.725
<i>Believe me, I'm very glad</i>
<i>you took pity on me</i>


730
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.126
<i>and offered to return</i>
<i>the ring,</i>


731
00:35:43.162 --> 00:35:45.996
<i>but it's a little mortifying</i>
<i>trying to remember</i>


732
00:35:46.031 --> 00:35:48.699
<i>everything I said, and</i>
<i>knowing you've read it all.</i>


733
00:35:49.969 --> 00:35:52.402
Respond to him, now!

734
00:35:52.438 --> 00:35:54.504
You do realize this is
a stranger, right?


735
00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.273
He's just a broken-hearted guy

736
00:35:56.308 --> 00:35:59.776
who rightly seems a tad insecure
at the moment.


737
00:36:01.113 --> 00:36:04.815
Ugh, fine!

738
00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:06.783
Uh...

739
00:36:06.819 --> 00:36:07.985
(typing)

740
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.453
<i>You were expressing</i>
<i>your feelings</i>


741
00:36:09.488 --> 00:36:11.121
<i>to a woman you loved.</i>

742
00:36:11.156 --> 00:36:13.423
<i>It's honest and vulnerable,</i>
<i>not sappy.</i>


743
00:36:13.459 --> 00:36:15.525
<i>And if someone doesn't see</i>
<i>that,</i>


744
00:36:15.561 --> 00:36:17.995
<i>they're not the right person</i>
<i>for you.</i>


745
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.465
See? You're perfect
for each other.


746
00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.966
(dinging)

747
00:36:23.002 --> 00:36:25.469
<i>If only you could've shared</i>
<i>this wisdom with me</i>


748
00:36:25.504 --> 00:36:27.871
<i>18 months ago.</i>

749
00:36:27.906 --> 00:36:30.774
This is a terrible idea.

750
00:36:30.809 --> 00:36:33.510
This is a terrible idea.

751
00:36:33.545 --> 00:36:35.545
You don't know each other.

752
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:37.848
What do you have to lose?

753
00:36:55.267 --> 00:36:56.933
(phone dinging)

754
00:37:02.674 --> 00:37:04.808
Josh:
<i>It feels bizarre that we could</i>
<i>walk right by each other</i>


755
00:37:04.843 --> 00:37:06.376
<i>and not even know it.</i>

756
00:37:06.412 --> 00:37:09.246
Hayley:
<i>I've spent my whole life</i>
<i>in this city</i>


757
00:37:09.281 --> 00:37:13.216
<i>and I don't actually know</i>
<i>where your street is.</i>


758
00:37:13.252 --> 00:37:17.687
<i>You could just use</i>

<i>Who says my carrier pigeons</i>

<i>I'm happy to tell you</i>

761
00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.531
<i>You don't need to send</i>

762
00:37:36.742 --> 00:37:40.577
<i>Are you still in love</i>
<i>with Marisol?</i>


763
00:37:45.484 --> 00:37:47.350
<i>I don't think so.</i>

764
00:37:47.386 --> 00:37:49.252
<i>Is that terrible?</i>

765
00:37:51.657 --> 00:37:54.224
<i>Of course not.</i>

766
00:37:54.259 --> 00:37:55.759
<i>We move on.</i>

767
00:37:55.794 --> 00:37:58.228
<i>Experiences change us.</i>

768
00:38:07.139 --> 00:38:09.539
<i>Trust is a funny thing.</i>

769
00:38:09.575 --> 00:38:12.409
<i>So tough to earn,</i>
<i>so easy to lose.</i>


770
00:38:17.015 --> 00:38:20.617
<i>So, you're one of those people</i>
<i>who only trusts yourself?</i>


771
00:38:22.988 --> 00:38:25.822
<i>Ha! Not at all.</i>

772
00:38:25.858 --> 00:38:28.425
<i>I sometimes have more faith</i>
<i>in the few people close to me</i>

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:35.932
<i>Are we exchanging real names</i>
<i>or identifying details?</i>


775
00:38:41.039 --> 00:38:44.074
<i>Is it all right</i>
<i>if I say not yet?</i>


776
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:45.775
<i>Of course.</i>

777
00:38:55.754 --> 00:38:57.053
(phone dinging)

778
00:38:57.089 --> 00:39:00.724
<i>Is there a deadline</i>
<i>to our online masquerade?</i>


779
00:39:00.759 --> 00:39:03.660
<i>Maybe we'll remain secret</i>
<i>friends forever,</i>


780
00:39:03.695 --> 00:39:05.862
<i>discussing the mysteries</i>
<i>of the universe</i>


781
00:39:05.898 --> 00:39:09.633
<i>and the worst flavors</i>
<i>of ice cream.</i>


782
00:39:09.668 --> 00:39:12.435
<i>Earl Grey.</i>
<i>There's no question there.</i>


783
00:39:14.606 --> 00:39:16.506
(laughing)
<i>Oh, come on!</i>


784
00:39:16.542 --> 00:39:21.478
<i>Earl Grey ice cream</i>
<i>is delicious!</i>


785
00:39:21.513 --> 00:39:24.314
<i>No!</i>
<i>It tastes like old tea bags!</i>


786
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:25.815
(laughing)

787
00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:27.984
What's so funny?

788
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:31.821
Nothing, just a meme Alex sent.

789
00:39:31.857 --> 00:39:34.658
Josh!
Less memes, more work.


790
00:39:34.693 --> 00:39:36.693
Copy.

791
00:39:39.631 --> 00:39:41.398
This could be some kind of scam.

792
00:39:41.433 --> 00:39:43.366
You don't think she'll actually
send you the ring back?


793
00:39:43.402 --> 00:39:44.601
She already did.

794
00:39:44.636 --> 00:39:46.570
A courier showed up
at my house at nine a.m.


795
00:39:46.605 --> 00:39:48.271
This girl paid for a courier.

796
00:39:48.307 --> 00:39:50.440
I doubt it's a scam.

797
00:39:50.475 --> 00:39:53.043
She seems cool from those
messages.


798
00:39:53.078 --> 00:39:55.545
She does,
but anyone can seem cool


799
00:39:55.581 --> 00:39:57.581
when they have time to plan
what they're going to say.


800
00:39:57.616 --> 00:40:00.350
You sound very un
-Josh-like.

801
00:40:00.385 --> 00:40:02.552
You love the mystery
of this kind of stuff.


802
00:40:02.588 --> 00:40:05.522
I like talking to her,
that's true.


803
00:40:05.557 --> 00:40:07.624
But I just wish I had the same
kind of faith I used to


804
00:40:07.659 --> 00:40:09.626
that things would
magically work out.


805
00:40:09.661 --> 00:40:11.528
The Josh I've known
since college


806
00:40:11.563 --> 00:40:14.931
would tell me even detours
are leading you somewhere.


807
00:40:14.967 --> 00:40:17.234
And somehow, that's led me
to a disappearing fiancée


808
00:40:17.269 --> 00:40:19.769
and an office building
being turned to rubble.


809
00:40:19.805 --> 00:40:22.472
But old Josh would say

810
00:40:22.507 --> 00:40:24.474
it's paving the way
to something better.


811
00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:26.276
Old Josh was usually right.

812
00:40:28.347 --> 00:40:32.115
You're probably right.

813
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.752
Marcus: Thyme, basil,
all that kind of stuff.


814
00:40:35.787 --> 00:40:37.454
Now, I know it's tempting

815
00:40:37.489 --> 00:40:39.222
to just want to rip
the tomatoes off,


816
00:40:39.258 --> 00:40:40.924
but they're very delicate.

817
00:40:40.959 --> 00:40:43.927
What you want to do is lightly
twist while you're pulling.


818
00:40:43.962 --> 00:40:46.830
That way, the tomato
will come right off


819
00:40:46.865 --> 00:40:48.932
and you won't damage the vine.

820
00:40:48.967 --> 00:40:50.567
Look at that! Great work!

821
00:40:50.602 --> 00:40:52.669
That's amazing, nice!

822
00:40:52.704 --> 00:40:54.604
(chuckling) Nice job!

823
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.773
You're learning so fast.

824
00:40:56.808 --> 00:40:58.808
Now, we can use this with
other fruits and vegetables.


825
00:40:58.844 --> 00:41:03.847
Um, apples, strawberries,
pumpkins.


826
00:41:05.851 --> 00:41:09.352
Mother Nature knows what to do.

827
00:41:12.524 --> 00:41:14.524
And that's our pitch.

828
00:41:14.559 --> 00:41:16.126
Mother Nature knows what to do.

829
00:41:16.161 --> 00:41:18.295
We teach our kids
to respect her,


830
00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:22.999
work alongside her
without getting in her way.


831
00:41:23.035 --> 00:41:25.235
Yeah  Is there anything else
I can do for you?


832
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.937
No, but thank you.

833
00:41:27.973 --> 00:41:30.607
No spying!

834
00:41:36.515 --> 00:41:38.181
(scoffing)

835
00:41:41.019 --> 00:41:44.521
(phone dinging)

836
00:41:44.556 --> 00:41:48.491
Josh:<i>Sometimes I think</i>
<i>consideration is a lost art.</i>


837
00:41:54.132 --> 00:41:55.865
Hayley:
<i>I don't think it is at all.</i>


838
00:41:55.901 --> 00:41:57.667
<i>We're in a new era.</i>

839
00:41:57.703 --> 00:41:59.536
<i>It's not just about what</i>
<i>you need,</i>


840
00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:01.604
<i>it's about deciding</i>
<i>what's truly an issue</i>


841
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.208
<i>and what comes down</i>
<i>to individual choices.</i>


842
00:42:05.243 --> 00:42:07.377
Josh:
<i>Now, that is wise.</i>


843
00:42:07.412 --> 00:42:08.845
(text whooshing)

844
00:42:15.253 --> 00:42:16.519
Oh, Hayley?

845
00:42:16.555 --> 00:42:18.221
Hi, me again!

846
00:42:18.256 --> 00:42:20.390
Um, do you mind doing
your meeting in your office?


847
00:42:20.425 --> 00:42:22.292
Because we have a graphic
designer coming in


848
00:42:22.327 --> 00:42:24.060
and we could really use
the space.


849
00:42:24.096 --> 00:42:27.197
We have our entire programs team
coming in today.


850
00:42:27.232 --> 00:42:28.998
I can't fit that in my office.

851
00:42:29.034 --> 00:42:31.368
We could really use the space,
though.


852
00:42:31.403 --> 00:42:33.703
And if it was just Elisa and I,

853
00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:35.572
I would totally let you guys
have it,


854
00:42:35.607 --> 00:42:37.073
but you have one designer

855
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:40.477
and we have four people coming
in with sports equipment


856
00:42:40.512 --> 00:42:42.912
and a few pieces of gardening,
and t-shirt mock-ups.


857
00:42:42.948 --> 00:42:44.414
I can't fit that in my cube.

858
00:42:44.449 --> 00:42:46.483
Fair enough.

859
00:42:46.518 --> 00:42:49.052
Lucy, do you mind doing our
meeting in the common area?


860
00:42:49.087 --> 00:42:51.020
I guess not.

861
00:42:51.056 --> 00:42:53.056
Great, not a problem.

862
00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:54.691
Great.

863
00:42:54.726 --> 00:42:56.025
(both laughing insincerely)

864
00:42:56.061 --> 00:42:57.394
Thanks.
Yeah.


865
00:43:08.106 --> 00:43:11.408
I kind of like Josh Burns...

866
00:43:11.443 --> 00:43:13.576
sometimes, sometimes.

867
00:43:13.612 --> 00:43:15.412
But he also drives me bananas.

868
00:43:15.447 --> 00:43:16.946
He's always in the office.

869
00:43:16.982 --> 00:43:19.048
He's there when I get in,
and he's there when I leave.


870
00:43:19.084 --> 00:43:21.451
He sounds like a worker bee.
What's wrong with that?


871
00:43:21.486 --> 00:43:26.022
It just makes me feel like
I'm not working hard enough.


872
00:43:26.057 --> 00:43:29.793
Well, maybe his job doesn't take
him out of the office


873
00:43:29.828 --> 00:43:31.728
as much as yours does.

874
00:43:31.763 --> 00:43:33.730
And this might come
as a big shock,


875
00:43:33.765 --> 00:43:35.632
but he might not even notice

876
00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:37.467
whether you're in the office
or out of the office.


877
00:43:37.502 --> 00:43:40.370
He doesn't like the smell of
my incense, for some reason.


878
00:43:40.405 --> 00:43:42.605
Hayley, it's really strong!

879
00:43:42.641 --> 00:43:44.107
Even for me, and I like it.

880
00:43:44.142 --> 00:43:47.243
Oh, no one likes the smell
of my incense.


881
00:43:47.279 --> 00:43:50.113
There must be something good
about this guy.


882
00:43:53.351 --> 00:43:55.585
Well, he's really good
at what he does.


883
00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:00.156
Aha, and that's what's
driving you nuts.


884
00:44:00.192 --> 00:44:03.159
You're always the most ambitious
person on the grant hunt.


885
00:44:03.195 --> 00:44:05.328
Maybe you've met your match.

886
00:44:05.363 --> 00:44:08.298
And maybe we'll lose.

887
00:44:08.333 --> 00:44:10.467
Rise to the challenge.

888
00:44:10.502 --> 00:44:13.002
That's all you can do.

889
00:44:16.641 --> 00:44:17.974
(phone dinging)

890
00:44:18.009 --> 00:44:21.678
Josh:
<i>How was your day?</i>


891
00:44:21.713 --> 00:44:23.947
Hayley:
<i>Is "ugh" a descriptive</i>
<i>enough response?</i>


892
00:44:23.982 --> 00:44:25.448
<i>Because ugh.</i>

893
00:44:25.484 --> 00:44:27.650
<i>Anything I can do to help?</i>

894
00:44:27.686 --> 00:44:29.686
<i>I am an ugh whisperer.</i>

895
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:33.022
<i>Not unless you run</i>
<i>a magic wand repair service.</i>


896
00:44:33.058 --> 00:44:37.627
<i>Mine seems to be</i>
<i>all out of pixie dust.</i>


897
00:44:37.662 --> 00:44:39.929
<i>Just because you didn't get</i>
<i>your way on a couple of things</i>


898
00:44:39.965 --> 00:44:41.865
<i>doesn't mean you're out</i>
<i>of magic.</i>


899
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.167
<i>I'm fine.</i>

900
00:44:44.202 --> 00:44:46.202
<i>I'm just a little overwhelmed</i>

901
00:44:46.238 --> 00:44:49.472
<i>and trying to find my voice</i>
<i>again.</i>


902
00:44:49.508 --> 00:44:52.008
<i>If it's any consolation,</i>

903
00:44:52.043 --> 00:44:55.011
<i>I hear you loud and clear.</i>

904
00:45:07.659 --> 00:45:09.192
Oh!

905
00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:13.229
(laughing)

906
00:45:13.265 --> 00:45:15.865
Looks like we're a little bit
too focused on our work.


907
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:18.635
Work?
I was playing a puzzle game.


908
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.169
Oh, that sounds a lot
more fun


909
00:45:20.205 --> 00:45:21.738
than looking at
cheaper prices of dirt.


910
00:45:21.773 --> 00:45:23.172
Hazards of the job.

911
00:45:23.208 --> 00:45:24.741
Is dirt expensive?

912
00:45:24.776 --> 00:45:26.309
Oh, yeah,
everything's expensive,


913
00:45:26.344 --> 00:45:28.645
especially when you say
the words "non-profit."


914
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.046
Right?

915
00:45:30.081 --> 00:45:32.649
It's like they see you
coming and up their price.


916
00:45:32.684 --> 00:45:35.385
That's why when I email, I do
it from a personal account.


917
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:37.253
Then, there's no way
for an up-charge.


918
00:45:37.289 --> 00:45:38.521
Smart.

919
00:45:38.557 --> 00:45:40.323
Oh, thanks.

920
00:45:40.358 --> 00:45:42.659
Um, and I'm really sorry
about the incense.


921
00:45:42.694 --> 00:45:45.595
I didn't think it would
bother anyone.


922
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.764
Oh, I'm sorry for being
overly sensitive.


923
00:45:47.799 --> 00:45:49.499
I have a nose
like a Bassett hound.


924
00:45:49.534 --> 00:45:53.069
Looks like a pretty average
guy nose to me.


925
00:45:53.104 --> 00:45:54.504
Thanks.

926
00:45:54.539 --> 00:45:56.506
(phone dinging)

927
00:45:56.541 --> 00:45:59.008
Oh!

928
00:45:59.044 --> 00:46:00.944
I think this is yours.

929
00:46:00.979 --> 00:46:02.278
Thank you.

930
00:46:02.314 --> 00:46:05.248
Looks like a fun game.

931
00:46:05.283 --> 00:46:07.617
Hayley, wait, I'm...

932
00:46:21.566 --> 00:46:23.566
Hey, you didn't respond
to my message.


933
00:46:23.602 --> 00:46:26.069
We're going to get this grant,
it just makes sense.


934
00:46:26.104 --> 00:46:27.704
Yes, thank you for that.

935
00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:29.639
Hayley saw your message
on my phone.


936
00:46:29.674 --> 00:46:32.175
Oh, no.

937
00:46:33.612 --> 00:46:35.111
I don't know how to fix this.

938
00:46:35.146 --> 00:46:36.412
Say you're sorry,

939
00:46:36.448 --> 00:46:38.381
and then, if she doesn't
accept it, oh well!


940
00:46:38.416 --> 00:46:39.916
This is a competition, Josh.

941
00:46:39.951 --> 00:46:41.551
Someone has got to lose,

942
00:46:41.586 --> 00:46:43.753
and if there's a choice,
I'd rather we be the winners.


943
00:46:43.788 --> 00:46:46.623
Okay, we need to work
on your bedside manner.


944
00:46:46.658 --> 00:46:50.426
<i>¶</i>

945
00:47:02.607 --> 00:47:04.273
Did the poet say
something weird?


946
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:06.209
What? Why?

947
00:47:06.244 --> 00:47:07.744
Because you look like
you're trying to crawl


948
00:47:07.779 --> 00:47:09.379
out of your own skin.

949
00:47:09.414 --> 00:47:11.147
I wish it was the poet.

950
00:47:11.182 --> 00:47:14.484
That way, I could block
and forget he even existed.


951
00:47:14.519 --> 00:47:16.452
I saw a message on Josh's phone
from his assistant


952
00:47:16.488 --> 00:47:18.287
saying that Mainframe
is a better charity


953
00:47:18.323 --> 00:47:20.390
because all we do
is plant tomatoes.


954
00:47:20.425 --> 00:47:23.059
But our produce goes
to soup kitchens!


955
00:47:23.094 --> 00:47:25.028
You're not upset about this,
just a little bit?


956
00:47:26.498 --> 00:47:28.064
I think she's scared, actually.

957
00:47:28.099 --> 00:47:29.932
That's something
I've never considered.


958
00:47:29.968 --> 00:47:33.770
Everybody and their brother
are giving kids tablets,


959
00:47:33.805 --> 00:47:35.405
you know this.

960
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.840
But even schools are cutting
field trips and gardens.


961
00:47:37.876 --> 00:47:41.644
You know what,
you are so right about this.


962
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.079
What we're doing
is the next thing.


963
00:47:43.114 --> 00:47:44.914
It's the renaissance of nature,

964
00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:48.351
rescuing kids from losing touch
from the outdoors.


965
00:47:48.386 --> 00:47:50.453
Don't let her intimidate you.

966
00:47:50.488 --> 00:47:52.021
No, we're going to win this,

967
00:47:52.057 --> 00:47:55.858
us with our tiny, little,
cute veggie plants.


968
00:47:55.894 --> 00:47:57.460
(laughing)

969
00:48:06.738 --> 00:48:08.838
Marcus in video:<i>Don't just see</i>
<i>one individual plant.</i>


970
00:48:08.873 --> 00:48:11.274
<i>See them working in concert,</i>
<i>using resources together.</i>


971
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:13.876
(phone dinging)

972
00:48:13.912 --> 00:48:16.512
Josh:
<i>It's my turn for "ugh".</i>


973
00:48:16.548 --> 00:48:18.881
<i>What do you do when you realize</i>
<i>you've been a colossal tool</i>


974
00:48:18.917 --> 00:48:20.883
<i>and need to make amends?</i>

975
00:48:25.223 --> 00:48:28.291
<i>As I'm a perfectly lovely</i>
<i>person at all times,</i>


976
00:48:28.326 --> 00:48:29.726
<i>I wouldn't know.</i>

977
00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:32.729
<i>Wink emoji.</i>

978
00:48:32.764 --> 00:48:34.697
<i>Is that a fact?</i>

979
00:48:37.102 --> 00:48:38.501
<i>Not at all.</i>

980
00:48:38.536 --> 00:48:40.570
<i>I have my moments like</i>
<i>everyone else.</i>


981
00:48:40.605 --> 00:48:43.172
<i>Did you try just saying</i>
<i>you were sorry?</i>


982
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:49.011
<i>Maybe in the vaguest,</i>
<i>most humiliated sense.</i>


983
00:48:49.047 --> 00:48:51.814
<i>So, no.</i>

984
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:56.219
<i>It's not revolutionary advice,</i>
<i>my dear poet.</i>


985
00:48:56.254 --> 00:48:58.054
<i>Swallow your pride,</i>

986
00:48:58.089 --> 00:49:01.724
<i>and assume the feeling is far</i>
<i>worse on the other side.</i>


987
00:49:06.965 --> 00:49:08.531
<i>Are you a life coach</i>

988
00:49:08.566 --> 00:49:10.900
<i>and is this conversation</i>
<i>really a long sales pitch</i>


989
00:49:10.935 --> 00:49:13.369
<i>to hire you</i>
<i>for your services?</i>


990
00:49:13.404 --> 00:49:15.605
<i>I'm a better sales person</i>
<i>than that.</i>


991
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.942
<i>You wouldn't see me coming.</i>

992
00:49:19.978 --> 00:49:24.147
<i>Probably not.</i>
<i>Is that a challenge?</i>


993
00:49:27.819 --> 00:49:30.052
Is that an invitation?

994
00:49:41.733 --> 00:49:45.468
Alex says put yourself
out there...


995
00:49:47.906 --> 00:49:50.006
Good work, terrible poet.

996
00:50:05.623 --> 00:50:07.523
(knocking)

997
00:50:14.265 --> 00:50:16.599
I wouldn't try any corporate
espionage if I were you.


998
00:50:16.634 --> 00:50:20.069
Although, I don't think
your pitch would work


999
00:50:20.104 --> 00:50:23.639
with giant photos of tomatoes.

1000
00:50:23.675 --> 00:50:27.677
I'm sorry,
that message was catty and mean.


1001
00:50:27.712 --> 00:50:30.613
Yeah, it was.

1002
00:50:33.017 --> 00:50:34.851
I could try to apologize

1003
00:50:34.886 --> 00:50:38.421
by saying I didn't write it
or respond to it.


1004
00:50:38.456 --> 00:50:40.189
I think I've heard
a similar sentiment


1005
00:50:40.225 --> 00:50:42.992
come out of your mouth
before.


1006
00:50:43.027 --> 00:50:45.561
I don't feel that way at all.

1007
00:50:49.667 --> 00:50:51.033
I'm intimidated by you,

1008
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:53.302
and I've been trying
to throw you off your game.


1009
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.808
Is that an apology?

1010
00:51:00.712 --> 00:51:02.011
I am sorry.

1011
00:51:02.046 --> 00:51:03.546
(laughing)

1012
00:51:03.581 --> 00:51:06.282
I'm sorry you had to read it
and that it was said.


1013
00:51:06.317 --> 00:51:10.052
And I let Lucy know
it's not okay.


1014
00:51:11.322 --> 00:51:12.822
You're intimidated by us?

1015
00:51:12.857 --> 00:51:17.393
Well, by you, more specifically.

1016
00:51:17.428 --> 00:51:20.396
You're calm and focused,
and you have this


1017
00:51:20.431 --> 00:51:24.400
"when I talk, people listen"
quality about you.


1018
00:51:24.435 --> 00:51:26.469
Really?

1019
00:51:26.504 --> 00:51:28.070
Yeah.

1020
00:51:28.106 --> 00:51:30.873
Not to mention, what you're
doing is incredible.


1021
00:51:30.909 --> 00:51:32.842
Taking the things that have been
stripped out of schools


1022
00:51:32.877 --> 00:51:34.710
and you're trying to--

1023
00:51:34.746 --> 00:51:36.879
Put them back
and preserve them, yeah.


1024
00:51:36.915 --> 00:51:38.915
Yeah.

1025
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:41.884
Your first two non-profits
hit $1 million in funding


1026
00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.886
in their first year.

1027
00:51:43.922 --> 00:51:45.421
That is unheard of.

1028
00:51:45.456 --> 00:51:48.157
Mainframe hasn't been
quite as fast.


1029
00:51:48.192 --> 00:51:50.092
People are much more
resistant to putting tech


1030
00:51:50.128 --> 00:51:51.894
into the hands of kids
than I thought.


1031
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.096
I find that surprising.

1032
00:51:54.132 --> 00:51:56.365
My cousin's kids
are in kindergarten


1033
00:51:56.401 --> 00:51:58.734
and they already know
how to code,


1034
00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:00.670
but they don't have a stitch
of grass to play on.


1035
00:52:00.705 --> 00:52:04.073
And see,
that's exactly the issue.


1036
00:52:04.108 --> 00:52:05.508
People feel like
it's oversaturated,


1037
00:52:05.543 --> 00:52:08.210
but kids don't need
to be told what to do,


1038
00:52:08.246 --> 00:52:09.679
and that's a mistake
we're making.


1039
00:52:09.714 --> 00:52:12.081
They need to discover it
for themselves.


1040
00:52:12.116 --> 00:52:16.218
Zen Forward, they get you.

1041
00:52:16.254 --> 00:52:18.054
You have nothing to worry about.

1042
00:52:18.089 --> 00:52:21.090
But you don't get me?

1043
00:52:22.961 --> 00:52:25.761
I actually think I do.

1044
00:52:25.797 --> 00:52:27.430
We're a lot like each other.

1045
00:52:27.465 --> 00:52:30.132
We're competitive,
ambitious...


1046
00:52:30.168 --> 00:52:31.867
Mm-hmm.

1047
00:52:31.903 --> 00:52:36.439
..and we both are...

1048
00:52:36.474 --> 00:52:38.941
pretty decent people.

1049
00:52:41.079 --> 00:52:44.580
Yeah, and I'm really starting to
see the value in what you do.


1050
00:52:44.615 --> 00:52:45.948
Ouch!

1051
00:52:45.984 --> 00:52:47.883
I really am kidding.

1052
00:52:47.919 --> 00:52:50.419
Kidding.

1053
00:52:50.455 --> 00:52:52.588
You're changing the world, Josh.

1054
00:52:54.425 --> 00:52:57.093
Thanks.

1055
00:52:57.128 --> 00:52:59.128
Yeah.

1056
00:52:59.163 --> 00:53:02.665
Well, I'll let you get back
to your tomatoes.


1057
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:05.067
Yeah, tomatoes!

1058
00:53:05.103 --> 00:53:07.069
(laughing awkwardly)
Yeah.


1059
00:53:07.105 --> 00:53:08.771
Good night.

1060
00:53:08.806 --> 00:53:11.307
Good night.

1061
00:53:19.951 --> 00:53:22.451
(giggling)

1062
00:53:41.472 --> 00:53:43.606
So, you just didn't respond
to the poet's invitation?


1063
00:53:43.641 --> 00:53:47.777
Well, we don't know if he and I
would get along in real life.


1064
00:53:47.812 --> 00:53:49.945
Yeah, that's what
you're worried about.


1065
00:53:49.981 --> 00:53:51.514
Elisa, I don't know.

1066
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:53.115
What if none of this is real?

1067
00:53:53.151 --> 00:53:55.117
Then, I have to hand it
to Poet and Marisol,


1068
00:53:55.153 --> 00:53:57.720
this is the most
elaborate ploy ever.


1069
00:53:57.755 --> 00:54:00.389
Hoping you'd maybe one day
open a random box,


1070
00:54:00.425 --> 00:54:02.491
then, spend days reading
someone else's letters


1071
00:54:02.527 --> 00:54:04.193
and get so emotionally
invested--


1072
00:54:04.228 --> 00:54:06.362
Okay, okay!

1073
00:54:06.397 --> 00:54:08.330
I know that I'm being silly.

1074
00:54:08.366 --> 00:54:10.800
I think you're playing it
too safe.


1075
00:54:10.835 --> 00:54:12.368
I mean, you take risks
in business.


1076
00:54:12.403 --> 00:54:14.737
It's time for you to take
some in your personal life, too.


1077
00:54:14.772 --> 00:54:16.038
Why does everyone always
say that?


1078
00:54:16.074 --> 00:54:18.007
I take so many risks!
I'm Hayley the risk-taker.


1079
00:54:18.042 --> 00:54:20.409
You back slowly out of the room
when a date sneezes.


1080
00:54:20.445 --> 00:54:21.911
And you don't walk away
from a guy


1081
00:54:21.946 --> 00:54:24.080
whose hobby makes your eyes
swell up.


1082
00:54:24.115 --> 00:54:26.248
It's his career, Hayley.

1083
00:54:26.284 --> 00:54:31.353
Look, I'll always be your old
lady canasta partner,


1084
00:54:31.389 --> 00:54:33.222
but you need some new friends.

1085
00:54:33.257 --> 00:54:34.690
More than friends.

1086
00:54:34.725 --> 00:54:37.059
And I think the poet
might just be the guy.


1087
00:54:37.095 --> 00:54:39.862
You need to meet the poet.

1088
00:54:39.897 --> 00:54:41.263
Just once.

1089
00:54:41.299 --> 00:54:44.600
And if you don't hit it off,
fine.


1090
00:54:44.635 --> 00:54:46.402
Fine?

1091
00:54:48.706 --> 00:54:50.739
(sighing)
Okay, I'll meet him.


1092
00:54:50.775 --> 00:54:52.308
Yes!
Ooh!


1093
00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.746
Hayley:
<i>Hey.</i>


1094
00:54:57.782 --> 00:54:59.415
<i>About last night...</i>

1095
00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:01.083
No, don't say that.

1096
00:55:01.119 --> 00:55:03.185
(phone dinging)

1097
00:55:03.221 --> 00:55:04.954
Josh:
<i>Clearly I freaked you out</i>
<i>last night.</i>


1098
00:55:04.989 --> 00:55:08.624
<i>I shouldn't have asked.</i>

1099
00:55:11.062 --> 00:55:12.895
<i>And I shouldn't have</i>
<i>blown you off.</i>


1100
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:14.763
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1101
00:55:14.799 --> 00:55:17.967
<i>I just got nervous.</i>

1102
00:55:18.002 --> 00:55:20.035
<i>No pressure from me.</i>

1103
00:55:20.071 --> 00:55:22.805
<i>We can stay secret friends,</i>
<i>just like you first said.</i>


1104
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.479
<i>No.</i>

1105
00:55:30.515 --> 00:55:32.314
<i>We should meet.</i>

1106
00:55:32.350 --> 00:55:33.949
<i>Soon?</i>

1107
00:55:33.985 --> 00:55:35.618
<i>But I'm a little</i>
<i>swamped at work,</i>


1108
00:55:35.653 --> 00:55:39.555
<i>so maybe we could table the</i>
<i>serious talk until next week?</i>


1109
00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:40.823
<i>But how will I ever discover</i>

1110
00:55:40.858 --> 00:55:43.225
<i>whether you say it "ketchup"</i>
<i>or "catsup"?</i>


1111
00:55:43.261 --> 00:55:45.761
(laughing)

1112
00:55:48.166 --> 00:55:49.732
<i>Soon.</i>

1113
00:55:49.767 --> 00:55:52.268
<i>Is that enough?</i>

1114
00:55:57.708 --> 00:56:00.342
<i>What more could I ask for?</i>

1115
00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.887
Videos of kids hiking, talking
about their time outdoors.


1116
00:56:11.923 --> 00:56:13.422
The clip with Marcus.

1117
00:56:13.457 --> 00:56:15.224
Your segue into being partners
with Mother Nature.


1118
00:56:15.259 --> 00:56:17.393
But carefully avoiding
the insinuation


1119
00:56:17.428 --> 00:56:19.261
that progress is bad.

1120
00:56:19.297 --> 00:56:23.933
We need technology and humanity
to walk hand in hand.


1121
00:56:25.469 --> 00:56:29.538
What if we didn't tell them?

1122
00:56:29.574 --> 00:56:31.373
We just showed them.

1123
00:56:31.409 --> 00:56:33.042
I'm pretty sure Sasha Raymond

1124
00:56:33.077 --> 00:56:34.643
doesn't want to trudge out
to the farm upstate.


1125
00:56:34.679 --> 00:56:37.112
No, but she's super
into that artisanal jam.


1126
00:56:37.148 --> 00:56:39.415
So, what if we picked
a basket full of produce,


1127
00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:42.251
brought it in that morning as a
visual of what our kids can do?


1128
00:56:42.286 --> 00:56:43.919
I like it.

1129
00:56:43.955 --> 00:56:45.888
Maybe they even take the food
home with them.


1130
00:56:45.923 --> 00:56:48.457
They don't need Josh and
Mainframe to give them tablets,


1131
00:56:48.492 --> 00:56:49.925
they already have those.

1132
00:56:49.961 --> 00:56:53.762
But if Sasha's making a salad
with our ingredients,


1133
00:56:53.798 --> 00:56:56.899
she'll end the day
thinking about Growing Out.


1134
00:56:56.934 --> 00:56:58.234
Brilliant.

1135
00:56:58.269 --> 00:56:59.468
Brilliant!

1136
00:56:59.503 --> 00:57:00.736
Oh, we got this.

1137
00:57:00.771 --> 00:57:02.271
Yes!

1138
00:57:07.878 --> 00:57:09.745
Marisol?

1139
00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:12.281
Hi.

1140
00:57:16.387 --> 00:57:18.187
How did you find me?

1141
00:57:18.222 --> 00:57:20.155
Lucy gave me the new address.

1142
00:57:20.191 --> 00:57:23.926
I was hoping we could talk?

1143
00:57:23.961 --> 00:57:25.594
Let's grab a coffee.

1144
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:27.196
There's not a lot
of privacy here.


1145
00:57:27.231 --> 00:57:29.198
Okay.

1146
00:57:36.407 --> 00:57:39.341
I guess I should start
with an apology.


1147
00:57:39.377 --> 00:57:41.110
I'm sorry.

1148
00:57:41.145 --> 00:57:42.444
Truly.

1149
00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.214
How I left was cowardly
and weak.


1150
00:57:45.249 --> 00:57:47.116
And cruel.

1151
00:57:47.151 --> 00:57:49.184
That's fair.

1152
00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.120
That wasn't my intention,
but you're right.


1153
00:57:54.091 --> 00:57:55.457
So, what happened?

1154
00:57:55.493 --> 00:57:57.126
Did you fall
out of love with me,


1155
00:57:57.161 --> 00:57:58.894
or did I do
something terribly wrong


1156
00:57:58.929 --> 00:58:00.195
and somehow I didn't realize?

1157
00:58:00.231 --> 00:58:01.930
No, nothing like that.

1158
00:58:01.966 --> 00:58:04.633
You know how I always wanted
to live in other countries.


1159
00:58:04.669 --> 00:58:06.769
Japan and Southeast Asia,

1160
00:58:06.804 --> 00:58:08.937
and anywhere else
that would have me.


1161
00:58:08.973 --> 00:58:11.106
When we first started dating,
yeah.


1162
00:58:11.142 --> 00:58:13.575
But then, you stopped
talking about it.


1163
00:58:13.611 --> 00:58:16.211
Except I didn't really
change my mind.


1164
00:58:16.247 --> 00:58:18.213
We got engaged
and I got scared,


1165
00:58:18.249 --> 00:58:20.482
thinking of sake
and cherry blossom trees


1166
00:58:20.518 --> 00:58:22.951
and how now I'd never see them.

1167
00:58:22.987 --> 00:58:24.620
How we'd have babies

1168
00:58:24.655 --> 00:58:26.989
and I'd be drowning
in diapers and pacifiers.


1169
00:58:27.024 --> 00:58:29.591
I got scared, I'm sorry.

1170
00:58:31.996 --> 00:58:35.064
So, you've been in Japan
the last year?


1171
00:58:35.099 --> 00:58:37.599
I have.

1172
00:58:37.635 --> 00:58:40.002
I found a cheap ticket
and I just...


1173
00:58:40.037 --> 00:58:41.570
Ran.

1174
00:58:41.605 --> 00:58:44.106
Yeah.

1175
00:58:50.448 --> 00:58:52.481
Why'd you take the ring
when you left?


1176
00:58:52.516 --> 00:58:54.616
Why didn't you just
send it back?


1177
00:58:54.652 --> 00:58:56.985
I lost it.

1178
00:58:57.021 --> 00:58:58.754
It wasn't intentional,
I swear.


1179
00:58:58.789 --> 00:59:00.289
I left so quickly,

1180
00:59:00.324 --> 00:59:02.191
I had to hire a moving company
to pack everything up.


1181
00:59:02.226 --> 00:59:04.593
I sent my brother to go through
my storage unit,


1182
00:59:04.628 --> 00:59:08.197
and that's when I realized
it was gone.


1183
00:59:08.232 --> 00:59:10.099
Please believe me when I say
I feel terrible.


1184
00:59:10.134 --> 00:59:12.868
I know how much
your grandmother meant to you.


1185
00:59:12.903 --> 00:59:14.303
I'm so sorry.

1186
00:59:14.338 --> 00:59:16.438
It's not gone.

1187
00:59:16.474 --> 00:59:18.374
It's in my apartment.

1188
00:59:18.409 --> 00:59:19.942
The person that bought
the condo after you,


1189
00:59:19.977 --> 00:59:21.910
they found it
and sent it to me.


1190
00:59:21.946 --> 00:59:23.645
That's a miracle.

1191
00:59:23.681 --> 00:59:24.980
Yeah.

1192
00:59:25.015 --> 00:59:27.015
It's almost like a sign.

1193
00:59:30.588 --> 00:59:31.954
If it is a sign,

1194
00:59:31.989 --> 00:59:33.722
I don't think it's the sign
you're looking for.


1195
00:59:33.758 --> 00:59:35.991
You really think after
everything,


1196
00:59:36.026 --> 00:59:37.926
we can't make it work?

1197
00:59:41.766 --> 00:59:43.298
I don't think we should try,
Marisol.


1198
00:59:43.334 --> 00:59:47.669
So, you're saying you don't
still love me?


1199
00:59:47.705 --> 00:59:52.408
I'm saying I'm a different
person than I was a year ago.


1200
00:59:52.443 --> 00:59:54.343
And so are you.

1201
00:59:54.378 --> 00:59:57.146
If you weren't happy
being stuck here before,


1202
00:59:57.181 --> 00:59:59.281
you're gonna feel
the same way again.


1203
01:00:10.795 --> 01:00:12.161
Coffee?

1204
01:00:12.196 --> 01:00:13.595
Uh, no, thanks?

1205
01:00:13.631 --> 01:00:15.464
Is that an answer
or a question?


1206
01:00:15.499 --> 01:00:17.833
Sorry, I'm stressed.

1207
01:00:17.868 --> 01:00:20.302
I probably don't need
any more caffeine.


1208
01:00:20.337 --> 01:00:21.770
You're going to do
amazing tomorrow,


1209
01:00:21.806 --> 01:00:23.272
no matter what happens.

1210
01:00:23.307 --> 01:00:25.007
Thank you.

1211
01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:26.442
This week flew by.

1212
01:00:26.477 --> 01:00:28.644
Tea.

1213
01:00:28.679 --> 01:00:31.914
Lemon balm tea to calm
and relax you.


1214
01:00:31.949 --> 01:00:33.415
Then, you can go back
to your effort


1215
01:00:33.451 --> 01:00:36.084
to crush me in the boardroom.

1216
01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:40.489
It's futile, but Zen Forward
will appreciate the effort.


1217
01:00:40.524 --> 01:00:42.191
Here you are.

1218
01:00:42.226 --> 01:00:45.160
Steep for about ten minutes
and it will be good to drink.


1219
01:00:45.196 --> 01:00:46.428
Thanks.

1220
01:00:46.464 --> 01:00:47.763
You should host a clinic

1221
01:00:47.798 --> 01:00:49.498
on using nature to soothe
the savage urban beast.


1222
01:00:49.533 --> 01:00:52.034
You should see my remedies
for colds.


1223
01:00:55.005 --> 01:00:56.438
Buck up, buttercup.

1224
01:00:56.474 --> 01:00:58.974
It's almost over.

1225
01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:08.684
I can't believe you didn't
tell me


1226
01:01:08.719 --> 01:01:11.887
about this poet guy until now.

1227
01:01:11.922 --> 01:01:14.389
I thought it was just gonna be
a few-day adventure, tops.


1228
01:01:14.425 --> 01:01:18.160
And now, I don't really know
what it is.


1229
01:01:18.195 --> 01:01:21.396
So, you left it like that?

1230
01:01:21.432 --> 01:01:24.399
You've agreed to meet the poet,
but you don't know when?


1231
01:01:24.435 --> 01:01:28.370
Well, there hasn't really been
a lot of chatting today.


1232
01:01:28.405 --> 01:01:30.506
If any.

1233
01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:32.641
I don't know what to say
at this point,


1234
01:01:32.676 --> 01:01:34.910
and maybe he feels the same way.

1235
01:01:34.945 --> 01:01:37.479
You've broken the spell.

1236
01:01:37.515 --> 01:01:39.314
What?

1237
01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:42.985
In the beginning, relationships
exist in a bubble.


1238
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.420
I haven't had much
online dating experience,


1239
01:01:45.456 --> 01:01:48.423
but I imagine that the bubble
is even stronger


1240
01:01:48.459 --> 01:01:50.392
because you don't have
the real world


1241
01:01:50.427 --> 01:01:51.994
sticking its head in
all the time.


1242
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:55.597
But once the bubble bursts -

1243
01:01:55.633 --> 01:01:59.234
in your case, when you guys
started talking about meeting -


1244
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:02.538
then there's an adjustment
period,


1245
01:02:02.573 --> 01:02:06.775
and the world catches up
pretty suddenly.


1246
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:10.212
How do you get past that?

1247
01:02:10.247 --> 01:02:12.381
Can you get past that?

1248
01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:15.417
Mm-hmm, with work.

1249
01:02:15.452 --> 01:02:18.220
Depends whether you want
to move into a new phase,


1250
01:02:18.255 --> 01:02:21.089
that's messier and stickier,

1251
01:02:21.125 --> 01:02:24.893
or do you just want to carry on

1252
01:02:24.929 --> 01:02:27.296
and search for a new bubble?

1253
01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:30.532
Is that what my problem is?

1254
01:02:30.568 --> 01:02:32.367
I'm always looking for
the bubble?


1255
01:02:32.403 --> 01:02:34.136
Oh!

1256
01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:37.773
No, Hayley, I don't think
that's your issue.


1257
01:02:37.808 --> 01:02:41.743
I think you're wary of
the bubble, almost too wary.


1258
01:02:41.779 --> 01:02:44.580
You wait for relationships
to explode,


1259
01:02:44.615 --> 01:02:49.184
and sometimes you just push them
enough to make it happen.


1260
01:02:51.322 --> 01:02:55.090
Then, how do I stop myself?

1261
01:02:57.127 --> 01:02:58.627
Write him back.

1262
01:02:58.662 --> 01:03:00.295
Okay.

1263
01:03:00.331 --> 01:03:04.299
Don't let silence be
your message, darling.


1264
01:03:08.172 --> 01:03:11.106
But Mom, what if he's not
interested in life,


1265
01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:13.909
and the world beyond the bubble?

1266
01:03:13.944 --> 01:03:17.679
Well, then you'll know.

1267
01:03:24.622 --> 01:03:27.122
<i>Hey.</i>

1268
01:03:27.157 --> 01:03:30.626
<i>Hope you had a great day.</i>

1269
01:03:30.661 --> 01:03:33.161
Too casual?

1270
01:03:35.799 --> 01:03:38.133
(text whooshing)

1271
01:03:50.681 --> 01:03:53.682
(phone ringing)

1272
01:03:53.717 --> 01:03:55.350
Elisa:
<i>What did you have</i>
<i>to say on the phone</i>


1273
01:03:55.386 --> 01:03:57.219
<i>that couldn't have been said</i>
<i>in 17 texts?</i>


1274
01:03:57.254 --> 01:04:00.489
You never read my texts.
Wait, are you in bed?


1275
01:04:00.524 --> 01:04:03.358
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>We have a big day tomorrow.</i>


1276
01:04:03.394 --> 01:04:05.060
Josh, he said
something to me today


1277
01:04:05.095 --> 01:04:08.530
that seemed like a throwaway,
but it has me thinking...


1278
01:04:08.565 --> 01:04:10.565
<i>That we can talk</i>
<i>about it tomorrow?</i>


1279
01:04:10.601 --> 01:04:13.468
That we can spend the next
twenty minutes exploring it now


1280
01:04:13.504 --> 01:04:15.570
in case we want to
add it to the pitch.


1281
01:04:15.606 --> 01:04:19.074
<i>Ugh. You'd better bring</i>
<i>extra coffee in tomorrow.</i>


1282
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:20.842
I always do.

1283
01:04:27.851 --> 01:04:30.852
You're not going
to respond to her?


1284
01:04:30.888 --> 01:04:32.521
Yesterday you were
all about this girl.


1285
01:04:32.556 --> 01:04:35.190
Well, that's just it.
After talking to Marisol,


1286
01:04:35.225 --> 01:04:36.992
I'm starting to wonder if I
actually have feelings


1287
01:04:37.027 --> 01:04:41.096
for this Fairy Godmother or I
just love the idea of it all -


1288
01:04:41.131 --> 01:04:43.732
some way to live the best parts
of an old relationship.


1289
01:04:45.536 --> 01:04:48.003
How was it,
seeing Marisol again?


1290
01:04:48.038 --> 01:04:50.739
Are you sure you don't still
have feelings for her?


1291
01:04:50.774 --> 01:04:52.941
Should I get back with her?

1292
01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:54.910
No! No, not at all.

1293
01:04:54.945 --> 01:04:58.513
I just...
I want you to be more upfront


1294
01:04:58.549 --> 01:05:00.115
about dealing
with the emotional stuff


1295
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:01.717
so it doesn't trip you up later.

1296
01:05:04.154 --> 01:05:07.022
It's time to
start dating again.


1297
01:05:07.057 --> 01:05:10.625
If not this Fairy Godmother,
then someone else.


1298
01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:15.597
About that... there is someone,
but it's kind of complicated.


1299
01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.233
When isn't it?

1300
01:05:27.511 --> 01:05:30.011
(beeping)

1301
01:05:37.921 --> 01:05:39.688
Boo.

1302
01:05:51.001 --> 01:05:53.368
Oh, come on! You can't bring
gifts to both meetings!


1303
01:05:53.403 --> 01:05:55.804
I know the rules of etiquette.
Besides, these aren't gifts.


1304
01:05:55.839 --> 01:05:58.573
Let's call this show and tell.
No peeking!


1305
01:05:58.609 --> 01:06:00.709
This at least has to
constitute a grey area.


1306
01:06:00.744 --> 01:06:03.245
I assure you I only deal in
bold, vibrant colors.


1307
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.279
Hi, guys!

1308
01:06:04.314 --> 01:06:05.947
Both: Hey!
Are we ready?


1309
01:06:05.983 --> 01:06:07.716
Yeah.

1310
01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:09.484
Okay. Please join us
in the conference room.


1311
01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.620
Ladies first.

1312
01:06:11.655 --> 01:06:13.655
Thank you.

1313
01:06:15.659 --> 01:06:19.394
What do you do
when you're stressed?


1314
01:06:19.429 --> 01:06:20.962
Do you go take a hike?

1315
01:06:20.998 --> 01:06:23.765
Maybe you spend a few moments

1316
01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:25.233
at your garden window.

1317
01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:27.068
There are any number
of charities


1318
01:06:27.104 --> 01:06:28.603
across the world right now

1319
01:06:28.639 --> 01:06:30.839
putting computers and tablets
into the hands of kids.


1320
01:06:30.874 --> 01:06:33.508
But we're not everybody.

1321
01:06:33.544 --> 01:06:35.744
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>tell me about all this.</i>


1322
01:06:35.779 --> 01:06:37.512
<i>I looked at the spices</i>
<i>in my grandma's house</i>


1323
01:06:37.548 --> 01:06:39.080
<i>and I decided to grow them.</i>

1324
01:06:39.116 --> 01:06:40.682
<i>(Hayley gasping)</i>

1325
01:06:40.717 --> 01:06:42.617
<i>This one's basil.</i>

1326
01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:47.455
<i>This one's thyme -</i>
<i>it's really stinky.</i>


1327
01:06:47.491 --> 01:06:49.591
<i>And then,</i>
<i>this one's oregano.</i>


1328
01:06:49.626 --> 01:06:51.526
When we added an app-making
class,


1329
01:06:51.562 --> 01:06:54.162
we expected the kids to make the
same old computer programs


1330
01:06:54.198 --> 01:06:57.132
that we made
in computer science.


1331
01:06:57.167 --> 01:07:00.035
But within a few weeks,
they were making games -


1332
01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:01.770
actual, playable games.

1333
01:07:01.805 --> 01:07:04.206
We've been holding
these kids back


1334
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:06.975
by restricting
their access to technology.


1335
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:10.011
Getting your hands into
the dirt is not only fun,


1336
01:07:10.047 --> 01:07:12.113
it sparks a lifelong curiosity

1337
01:07:12.149 --> 01:07:15.116
to the food we eat
and the world around us.


1338
01:07:15.152 --> 01:07:18.553
It breeds confidence
that we cannot teach.


1339
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:20.322
These are the
voices of the future.


1340
01:07:20.357 --> 01:07:22.457
I don't want them playing
<i>Aliens versus Spiders</i> all day.


1341
01:07:22.492 --> 01:07:26.127
I want them to actually
understand how the game works,


1342
01:07:26.163 --> 01:07:28.230
how to solve problems.

1343
01:07:28.265 --> 01:07:29.731
Now, this right here
is not a gift.


1344
01:07:29.766 --> 01:07:31.399
No. It's a small,

1345
01:07:31.435 --> 01:07:33.034
very small percentage
of what our kids grew,


1346
01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:35.637
harvested just this morning.

1347
01:07:35.672 --> 01:07:37.873
Our kids,
they know what Swiss chard is


1348
01:07:37.908 --> 01:07:40.976
and they know how to cook it.
Now, I don't know about you,


1349
01:07:41.011 --> 01:07:43.879
but that was not a part of my
vocabulary when I was ten.


1350
01:07:43.914 --> 01:07:47.148
Because one day, this could
lead to the development


1351
01:07:47.184 --> 01:07:50.418
of a medical device that could
measure blood loss in real time.


1352
01:07:50.454 --> 01:07:53.188
The truth is we have more to
learn from these kids


1353
01:07:53.223 --> 01:07:54.756
than they can from us.

1354
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:57.726
Use them. Take them home.

1355
01:07:57.761 --> 01:08:01.529
See what a few dozen hands
in the dirt gets you,


1356
01:08:01.565 --> 01:08:04.199
and think what
hundreds more can do.


1357
01:08:12.943 --> 01:08:15.744
I do not care if anyone
sees me in my sneakers.


1358
01:08:15.779 --> 01:08:18.046
Oh, you're prepared
for everything.


1359
01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:19.514
Oh, yeah.
Wow.


1360
01:08:19.549 --> 01:08:20.782
Yeah.

1361
01:08:24.922 --> 01:08:26.388
Better?

1362
01:08:26.423 --> 01:08:29.524
So much better.

1363
01:08:29.559 --> 01:08:31.026
You were
Incredible in there.


1364
01:08:31.061 --> 01:08:33.094
Thanks. You, too.

1365
01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:34.729
Although, I'm a little
worried about children


1366
01:08:34.765 --> 01:08:36.364
leading a robot
takeover of the world.


1367
01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.301
That's exactly what
I'm trying to prevent, Hayley.


1368
01:08:39.336 --> 01:08:42.037
I guess I wasn't
as clear as I thought.


1369
01:08:42.072 --> 01:08:44.873
No. It's gonna be
a really tough decision.


1370
01:08:44.908 --> 01:08:47.242
I'm glad I'm not
the one making it.


1371
01:08:47.277 --> 01:08:49.577
(sighing)
Yeah.


1372
01:08:49.613 --> 01:08:52.280
Well, now that
you have your comfy shoes on,


1373
01:08:52.316 --> 01:08:54.049
you wanna walk
back to the office?


1374
01:08:54.084 --> 01:08:56.484
You know, I think I'm
going to play hooky


1375
01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.654
for the rest of the day.
Just please do not tell my boss.


1376
01:08:59.690 --> 01:09:02.924
I promise I won't say anything
to you about your day off.


1377
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.226
Thanks. I'll see you Monday?

1378
01:09:05.262 --> 01:09:06.428
See you Monday.

1379
01:09:06.463 --> 01:09:07.896
Bye.

1380
01:09:07.931 --> 01:09:09.531
Bye.

1381
01:09:16.306 --> 01:09:19.240
(phone beeping)

1382
01:09:19.276 --> 01:09:21.977
Hayley:
<i>Hey. Hope you've had</i>
<i>a great day.</i>


1383
01:09:22.012 --> 01:09:26.147
Josh:
<i>Honestly, it's been</i>
<i>a weird 48 hours.</i>


1384
01:09:26.183 --> 01:09:29.351
Hayley:
<i>Need to talk about it?</i>


1385
01:09:29.386 --> 01:09:32.520
Josh:
<i>Marisol showed up.</i>


1386
01:09:32.556 --> 01:09:34.990
<i>She's been in</i>
<i>Japan the last year.</i>


1387
01:09:38.895 --> 01:09:42.764
Hayley:
<i>Wow. Are you okay?</i>


1388
01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:46.034
Josh:
<i>Yes and no.</i>


1389
01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:47.969
<i>I didn't realize until</i>
<i>I saw her</i>


1390
01:09:48.005 --> 01:09:51.639
<i>just how much I've kept my life</i>
<i>on hold since she left.</i>


1391
01:09:51.675 --> 01:09:54.309
Hayley:
<i>And now that you've</i>
<i>had some kind of closure,</i>


1392
01:09:54.344 --> 01:09:57.045
<i>do you think that you can</i>
<i>finally move on?</i>


1393
01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:05.887
Josh:
<i>Yeah, about that...</i>


1394
01:10:15.766 --> 01:10:25.766
<i>¶</i>

1395
01:10:38.722 --> 01:10:40.989
How are you
even here right now?


1396
01:10:41.024 --> 01:10:43.758
And with
the exact same pizza.


1397
01:10:43.794 --> 01:10:46.061
Well, there's a lot
of possible answers to that -


1398
01:10:46.096 --> 01:10:47.762
fate, destiny...

1399
01:10:47.798 --> 01:10:50.732
Oh! You got that
pizza coupon text, right?


1400
01:10:50.767 --> 01:10:52.400
Yes, I did.

1401
01:10:52.436 --> 01:10:56.571
Well, maybe the employee's
name is Destiny?


1402
01:10:56.606 --> 01:10:58.373
Do you want to join me?

1403
01:10:58.408 --> 01:11:00.909
That is if you feel okay
dining with the enemy.


1404
01:11:00.944 --> 01:11:03.011
Well, we're done pitching,

1405
01:11:03.046 --> 01:11:07.082
So you're not the enemy anymore,
if you ever were.


1406
01:11:07.117 --> 01:11:10.118
Great.
Have a seat.


1407
01:11:10.153 --> 01:11:11.386
Thanks.

1408
01:11:11.421 --> 01:11:12.620
No problem.

1409
01:11:12.656 --> 01:11:13.888
It's delicious.

1410
01:11:13.924 --> 01:11:15.423
Oh, you've tried
this before?


1411
01:11:15.459 --> 01:11:17.125
Oh, many times.
It's my favorite thing to eat.


1412
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.960
I've gotten the coupon
once or twice.


1413
01:11:18.995 --> 01:11:20.261
Oh, yeah.

1414
01:11:20.297 --> 01:11:23.098
You know what's so crazy?

1415
01:11:23.133 --> 01:11:25.967
Is I literally
see you every single day


1416
01:11:26.002 --> 01:11:29.037
and I don't know
anything about you.


1417
01:11:29.072 --> 01:11:31.773
You know, I don't know
anything about you, either.


1418
01:11:31.808 --> 01:11:34.042
Other than your almost
mystical connection to nature.


1419
01:11:34.077 --> 01:11:36.644
Well, it's not
really that mystical.


1420
01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.881
My mom had a rooftop garden when
I was a kid growing up uptown.


1421
01:11:39.916 --> 01:11:41.950
Still does, actually.

1422
01:11:41.985 --> 01:11:44.486
And I always thought it was so
cool and appreciated the fact


1423
01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:48.089
that a female stock market maven
grew herbs in her spare time.


1424
01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:52.127
See, I feel like knowing
this about your mother


1425
01:11:52.162 --> 01:11:53.495
explains so much about you.

1426
01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:55.396
(laughing)
Yep.


1427
01:11:55.432 --> 01:11:57.899
And what about you?
What was your family like?


1428
01:11:57.934 --> 01:12:00.568
Youngest of three brothers,

1429
01:12:00.604 --> 01:12:02.403
all of whom work for
my dad's accounting firm.


1430
01:12:02.439 --> 01:12:04.105
My mother was a librarian.

1431
01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:07.509
Oh, a librarian, interesting.
Yeah. Yep.


1432
01:12:07.544 --> 01:12:10.178
Okay. So, you were
a bookish kid.


1433
01:12:10.213 --> 01:12:12.447
Is this somehow
revelatory or...?


1434
01:12:12.482 --> 01:12:17.318
No. I just like picturing little
Josh with his nose in a book.


1435
01:12:17.354 --> 01:12:20.054
Nose in books, nose in the
local library computers,


1436
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:21.523
trying to fix them
when their budgets


1437
01:12:21.558 --> 01:12:22.657
couldn't afford IT people.

1438
01:12:22.692 --> 01:12:23.725
Oh...

1439
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.793
Really nerdy.
Nerdy, yeah.


1440
01:12:25.829 --> 01:12:28.029
Yeah, yeah.
(chuckling)


1441
01:12:28.064 --> 01:12:30.565
But I guess we're both products
of our own upbringing.


1442
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.402
Yes, exactly, which is
why I'm trying to instill


1443
01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:36.704
these values
to the children young.


1444
01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:38.206
I'm already on-board.

1445
01:12:38.241 --> 01:12:40.041
You don't have to
sell it anymore.


1446
01:12:40.076 --> 01:12:42.510
I believe you. I like it.

1447
01:12:42.546 --> 01:12:44.312
It's good.

1448
01:12:44.347 --> 01:12:51.653
Oh. Thanks.

1449
01:12:51.688 --> 01:12:55.156

This is where I will
leave you for tonight.

You live here?
Like, right here?


1459

(laughing)
Yes.

I promise you, it's a really
great neighborhood.


1461
01:13:45.842 --> 01:13:47.942
I know.
Lots of character here.


1462
01:13:47.978 --> 01:13:50.812
Yeah, I don't need the same
coffee shop every two blocks.


1463
01:13:50.847 --> 01:13:53.781
I really do love my
two-storey walk-up.


1464
01:13:55.285 --> 01:13:56.651
Nice.

1465
01:13:56.686 --> 01:13:58.620
Listen, Josh.

1466
01:13:58.655 --> 01:14:01.789
Whatever happens tomorrow,

1467
01:14:01.825 --> 01:14:04.125
good luck.

1468
01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.160
You too.

1469
01:14:12.502 --> 01:14:13.735
Thank you. Yep.

1470
01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:15.637
Thanks.

1471
01:14:15.672 --> 01:14:17.472
Good night.

1472
01:14:17.507 --> 01:14:19.173

<i>¶</i>

1475
01:15:11.361 --> 01:15:12.894
What did I just see?

1476
01:15:12.929 --> 01:15:14.962
I don't know.

1477
01:15:14.998 --> 01:15:16.464
I'm walking home
and I hear you laugh,


1478
01:15:16.499 --> 01:15:17.732
and I look over,

1479
01:15:17.767 --> 01:15:19.634
you're having a full on moment

1480
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:21.569
with Mr. Might Walk Away
With Our Grant Money.


1481
01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:23.838
That is totally normal
to be spying on me


1482
01:15:23.873 --> 01:15:25.373
like a nosy sitcom neighbor.

1483
01:15:25.408 --> 01:15:27.642
I wasn't spying.
I was walking home.


1484
01:15:27.677 --> 01:15:29.644
Do you like Josh Burns?

1485
01:15:29.679 --> 01:15:31.079
What about the Poet?

1486
01:15:31.114 --> 01:15:32.613
I feel so out of the
loop all of a sudden.


1487
01:15:34.217 --> 01:15:36.184
The Poet dumped me.

1488
01:15:36.219 --> 01:15:38.186
Well, not really
because we never were


1489
01:15:38.221 --> 01:15:39.921
in a real life relationship.

1490
01:15:39.956 --> 01:15:42.824
But he realized he had feelings
for someone in his real life


1491
01:15:42.859 --> 01:15:46.828
and I thought...

1492
01:15:46.863 --> 01:15:49.030
so do I.

1493
01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:52.166
But you and The Poet
have so much in common.


1494
01:15:52.202 --> 01:15:54.268
Except that we don't.

1495
01:15:54.304 --> 01:15:56.404
We don't know a single
identifying thing


1496
01:15:56.439 --> 01:15:58.272
about each other
except our addresses.


1497
01:15:58.308 --> 01:16:00.708
So, Josh Burns?

1498
01:16:00.744 --> 01:16:02.543
Yeah, Josh Burns.
(giggling)


1499
01:16:02.579 --> 01:16:04.946
Say you date him,

1500
01:16:04.981 --> 01:16:07.048
what happens if we
compete against him again?


1501
01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:08.583
I don't know.

1502
01:16:08.618 --> 01:16:11.853
But I'm tired.
I think we should go to bed.


1503
01:16:11.888 --> 01:16:16.557
Or we could stay up
watching romantic comedies.


1504
01:16:16.593 --> 01:16:18.860
Oh, yeah!
That sounds so much better!


1505
01:16:18.895 --> 01:16:21.229
(sighing)

1506
01:16:21.264 --> 01:16:22.964
(phone beeping)

1507
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.566
(camera shutter clicking)

1508
01:16:25.602 --> 01:16:28.536
Two dollars off the best
tiramisu in town.


1509
01:16:28.571 --> 01:16:30.571
It's after eleven.

1510
01:16:30.607 --> 01:16:33.341
Who's in charge of
sending these texts?


1511
01:16:35.478 --> 01:16:36.911
Got your favorite.

1512
01:16:36.946 --> 01:16:39.080
Thanks for coming out, man.
I know it's late.


1513
01:16:39.115 --> 01:16:41.215
Are you kidding?
I had to.


1514
01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:43.651
You think Hayley Hammond
is your Fairy Godmother?


1515
01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:45.887
I saw her building.

1516
01:16:45.922 --> 01:16:48.122
She has to be.
It's Marisol's.


1517
01:16:48.158 --> 01:16:50.558
Could they maybe just live in
the same co-op building?


1518
01:16:50.593 --> 01:16:52.460
It's a long shot,
but it could happen.


1519
01:16:52.495 --> 01:16:53.995
I saw the letters.

1520
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:55.630
They were sitting
right there in her office.


1521
01:16:55.665 --> 01:16:59.567
(exhaling sharply)

1522
01:16:59.602 --> 01:17:02.069
Is this... good?

1523
01:17:02.105 --> 01:17:04.305
You liked both women

1524
01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:06.607
but now you find out you
really just like one woman.


1525
01:17:06.643 --> 01:17:08.142
I'd call that a win.

1526
01:17:08.178 --> 01:17:10.144
She lives in
Marisol's old condo.


1527
01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.146
She's read every sad,
weepy love letter


1528
01:17:12.182 --> 01:17:13.748
I've written to an ex-fiancée.

1529
01:17:13.783 --> 01:17:15.616
The first time she
invited me over for dinner,


1530
01:17:15.652 --> 01:17:18.085
I'd be really hard-pressed
not to run the other way.


1531
01:17:18.121 --> 01:17:19.921
Except you didn't seem
to care about that


1532
01:17:19.956 --> 01:17:21.622
when she was just
a voice from the internet.


1533
01:17:21.658 --> 01:17:23.791
Because I wasn't thinking
about it. It wasn't real.


1534
01:17:23.827 --> 01:17:25.626
I think my reaction
would be the same


1535
01:17:25.662 --> 01:17:28.463
if we ever progressed
to meeting face to face.


1536
01:17:28.498 --> 01:17:30.164
Look, I can't tell
you what to do.


1537
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.433
But you know it isn't
easy to find someone


1538
01:17:32.469 --> 01:17:34.502
you really connect with,
and the universe keeps


1539
01:17:34.537 --> 01:17:37.004
throwing this woman in your path
again and again and again.


1540
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.341
If you ignore it because
you're a little embarrassed--


1541
01:17:40.376 --> 01:17:43.311
Embarrassed? Try suffering
from abject humiliation.


1542
01:17:43.346 --> 01:17:44.712
(stammering)

1543
01:17:44.747 --> 01:17:47.381
All right, it's rough.

1544
01:17:47.417 --> 01:17:50.618
But you're being
a little over-dramatic.


1545
01:17:50.653 --> 01:17:52.286
She's read the best
and the worst of you


1546
01:17:52.322 --> 01:17:54.622
and she still likes you, Josh.

1547
01:17:54.657 --> 01:17:56.858
There's a lot
to be said for that.


1548
01:18:20.316 --> 01:18:22.383
Do you think that
Josh is avoiding me?


1549
01:18:22.418 --> 01:18:24.185
He's always in
the office by ten a.m.


1550
01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:27.021
If you continue to ask me,
I'm gonna start avoiding you.


1551
01:18:27.056 --> 01:18:28.322
(phone ringing)

1552
01:18:28.358 --> 01:18:32.226
(phone ringing)

1553
01:18:32.262 --> 01:18:34.195
It's Zen Forward.

1554
01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:36.397
(phone ringing)

1555
01:18:36.432 --> 01:18:39.133
Speakerphone or I never make you
my famous apple pie again.


1556
01:18:39.168 --> 01:18:41.736
I love you, but you buy that pie
from the bakery in Union Square.


1557
01:18:46.075 --> 01:18:47.808
Good morning, Sasha Raymond.

1558
01:18:47.844 --> 01:18:49.343
Sasha:
<i>Hello there, Hayley.</i>


1559
01:18:49.379 --> 01:18:51.212
<i>I'm so excited to</i>
<i>be making this call.</i>


1560
01:18:53.383 --> 01:18:56.517
(squealing happily)

1561
01:18:56.553 --> 01:18:58.052
(squealing happily)

1562
01:18:58.087 --> 01:18:59.487
(squealing happily)

1563
01:18:59.522 --> 01:19:01.389
That can't be good.

1564
01:19:01.424 --> 01:19:03.758
(screaming happily)

1565
01:19:03.793 --> 01:19:06.294
Act cool, act cool.

1566
01:19:08.131 --> 01:19:10.965
(screaming happily)

1567
01:19:12.602 --> 01:19:13.834
They love my plants!

1568
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:16.370
(screaming happily)

1569
01:19:23.446 --> 01:19:25.780
Congratulations.

1570
01:19:25.815 --> 01:19:27.548
I just spoke
to Sasha Raymond.


1571
01:19:27.584 --> 01:19:31.786
Oh, Lucy, thanks so much.
Thank you.


1572
01:19:31.821 --> 01:19:35.389
And I have to tell you,
Josh's pitch was fantastic.


1573
01:19:35.425 --> 01:19:37.191
I'm a really big fan
of what you guys do.


1574
01:19:37.226 --> 01:19:39.894
Yeah, well,
it's wasn't a total loss.


1575
01:19:39.929 --> 01:19:42.964
Zen Forward did decide
to give us a small grant.


1576
01:19:42.999 --> 01:19:46.467
Fifty grand isn't two hundred
and fifty, but it's something.


1577
01:19:46.502 --> 01:19:48.302
That's amazing.

1578
01:19:48.338 --> 01:19:50.204
This will be tough
on Josh, though.


1579
01:19:50.239 --> 01:19:52.907
He fancies himself
this Techie Poet


1580
01:19:52.942 --> 01:19:55.710
who can talk anyone
into the powers of technology.


1581
01:19:55.745 --> 01:19:58.112
It's hard on him when he
realizes that he can't.


1582
01:20:00.917 --> 01:20:04.051
I'm sorry, um...

1583
01:20:04.087 --> 01:20:08.623
did you say Techie Poet?

1584
01:20:08.658 --> 01:20:11.058
Oh yeah, it's this nickname
that he got back in college.


1585
01:20:11.094 --> 01:20:12.393
I don't know. I told him that,

1586
01:20:12.428 --> 01:20:13.928
over the age of thirty,
it's questionable,


1587
01:20:13.963 --> 01:20:16.297
but he seems
pretty attached to it.


1588
01:20:16.332 --> 01:20:18.833
I'm sorry.
Would you happen to know


1589
01:20:18.868 --> 01:20:20.801
where Josh is right now?

1590
01:20:20.837 --> 01:20:23.971
I don't. Uh, I think he
said he was taking the day.


1591
01:20:25.308 --> 01:20:27.808
Thank you.

1592
01:20:28.945 --> 01:20:31.445
Nice talking to you.

1593
01:20:50.433 --> 01:20:52.033
This is crazy.

1594
01:20:52.068 --> 01:20:54.235
Why would you even think
that he'd come here?


1595
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:56.504
(sighing)

1596
01:20:56.539 --> 01:20:57.938
Hi.

1597
01:21:01.044 --> 01:21:02.610
Hi.

1598
01:21:02.645 --> 01:21:05.346
I hear congratulations
are in order.


1599
01:21:05.381 --> 01:21:09.750
Oh. Yeah. Thank you.

1600
01:21:09.786 --> 01:21:11.185
You too.

1601
01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:13.387
You don't have to
temper your excitement.


1602
01:21:13.423 --> 01:21:15.790
I know this is a
huge moment for Growing Out.


1603
01:21:15.825 --> 01:21:18.759
No, no. I really am
legitimately happy for you,


1604
01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:20.027
and that's entirely separate

1605
01:21:20.063 --> 01:21:22.730
from my unabashed glee
for Elisa I.


1606
01:21:22.765 --> 01:21:25.700
Listen, I have an insane
question to ask you,


1607
01:21:25.735 --> 01:21:29.036
and you might want to have me
involuntarily committed,


1608
01:21:29.072 --> 01:21:30.571
but I promise
there's a reason for it.


1609
01:21:30.606 --> 01:21:32.406
I know you're the Fairy
Godmother, Hayley.


1610
01:21:32.442 --> 01:21:35.076
Oh.

1611
01:21:35.111 --> 01:21:37.611
So, did you know during dinner

1612
01:21:37.647 --> 01:21:40.414
or was my freak-out on your
front steps the big reveal?


1613
01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:43.484
That was you freaking ou

1614
01:21:43.519 --> 01:21:46.420
Oh, I thought we were
having a very sweet


1615
01:21:46.456 --> 01:21:49.323
summer in the city moment
that could've lead to...


1616
01:21:51.494 --> 01:21:53.127
Oh God.

1617
01:21:53.162 --> 01:21:56.130
Oh no. That was all in my head.

1618
01:21:56.165 --> 01:21:58.899
You trying to run away when you
realized who I was. That is--


1619
01:21:58.935 --> 01:22:01.235
I promise, we were
having the same moment.


1620
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:06.006
Just when I saw your front door,
my brain short-circuited.


1621
01:22:06.042 --> 01:22:09.977
If my fight or flight
response didn't tip you off,


1622
01:22:10.012 --> 01:22:11.612
then how did you know?

1623
01:22:11.647 --> 01:22:13.180
Lucy.

1624
01:22:13.216 --> 01:22:14.448
Lucy.

1625
01:22:14.484 --> 01:22:15.750
Yeah.

1626
01:22:15.785 --> 01:22:17.785
She called you the Techie Poet,

1627
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:21.322
which I thought sounded really
bizarre, but then...


1628
01:22:21.357 --> 01:22:24.291
also right...

1629
01:22:24.327 --> 01:22:26.460
somehow.

1630
01:22:26.496 --> 01:22:30.197
I really like you.

1631
01:22:30.233 --> 01:22:32.032
Both versions of you,

1632
01:22:32.068 --> 01:22:34.335
all of you.

1633
01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:36.337
And I can't change my
address, and I truly can't


1634
01:22:36.372 --> 01:22:38.172
because it took all
my savings to buy it.


1635
01:22:38.207 --> 01:22:41.342
But...

1636
01:22:41.377 --> 01:22:44.478
I'm hoping you'll see past that.

1637
01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:50.317
If it's not too much to ask.

1638
01:22:54.924 --> 01:22:57.691
Well, I was just
walking down here


1639
01:22:57.727 --> 01:22:59.460
to get two pieces of tiramisu

1640
01:22:59.495 --> 01:23:02.663
because of this coupon
I got texted last night.


1641
01:23:02.698 --> 01:23:07.001
But then, I was thinking
of walking by your place


1642
01:23:07.036 --> 01:23:09.236
to give you a dessert
and a congratulations


1643
01:23:09.272 --> 01:23:12.873
and... maybe take
you out for dinner.


1644
01:23:14.577 --> 01:23:17.044
If that's not too much to ask.

1645
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:24.618
I think that sounds... perfect.

1646
01:23:25.888 --> 01:23:32.526
<i>¶</i>

1647
01:23:38.401 --> 01:23:41.402
This is the strangest ending to
a fairy-tale I've ever heard of.


1648
01:23:41.437 --> 01:23:45.272
You think this is
the end of the story?


1649
01:23:45.308 --> 01:23:49.476
This is just the beginning,
my dearest Poet.


1650
01:23:51.147 --> 01:23:59.920
