00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:23.028
Jody, time to go.

2
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.645
Oh, aren't you excited?

3
00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:27.060
Get his bag.

4
00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:28.288
Thanks for your help, sister.

5
00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:29.679
Oh, my pleasure.

6
00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:31.107
There you go, son.

7
00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.416
- See you. 
- Bye.

8
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.083
Good-bye, dear.

9
00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:43.735
Say thank you to sister.

10
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.911
Thank you, sister.

11
00:01:44.936 --> 00:01:47.068
- Let me get one more shot.
- Right here.


12
00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:49.274
- Ok. 
- Bye-bye.

13
00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.990
Goodbye, dear.

14
00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:59.957
One day, the great king
of the silver baboons


15
00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:04.184
came down from a peak
high on a mountaintop in Kilimanjaro.


16
00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:10.054
and caught your father stealing his treasure
from a deep, dark cave,


17
00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.675
from which enchanted rubies
spilled out down the mountainside.


18
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.153
After a great battle
with the baboon king,


19
00:02:18.178 --> 00:02:22.017
your father was very badly
wounded and left to die.


20
00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:24.984
But when the baboon king found out

21
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:30.264
that your father wanted the
enchanted rubies to cure his son...


22
00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.122
Sister, Adam's not breathing!

23
00:02:33.147 --> 00:02:35.282
Children, children,
move to the side.


24
00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:36.183
Adam.

25
00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:37.166
Adam!

26
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:38.825
Is he dead?

27
00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:43.283
Did he hurt his head?

28
00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:44.017
I don't know.

29
00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:46.172
They just said
he wasn't breathing.


30
00:02:46.637 --> 00:02:47.997
Well, he's breathing now.

31
00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:50.718
- Call sister Kathryn. 
- I will.

32
00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:51.931
Adam...

33
00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:53.540
Adam...

34
00:02:53.883 --> 00:02:54.966
Adam.

35
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.549
Oh, don't give up on us.

36
00:03:00.842 --> 00:03:02.984
Don't you give up, child.

37
00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:09.160
Don't you break our hearts.

38
00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:15.413
Oh, Adam...

39
00:03:15.438 --> 00:03:17.405
I've tried so hard with you.

40
00:03:17.857 --> 00:03:20.574
That poor little heart of yours,

41
00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:23.295
I don't know what else to do.

42
00:03:33.277 --> 00:03:34.728
Oh, Adam.

Hi. 
- Hi.

67
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.316
I missed you.

68
00:05:34.341 --> 00:05:35.192
You missed me?

69
00:05:35.217 --> 00:05:36.066
Mm-hmm.

70
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:37.853
Since what, yesterday?

71
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.799
Yeah. Why not?

72
00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:46.632
Aren't we going?

73
00:05:48.127 --> 00:05:48.949
Yeah.

74
00:05:50.362 --> 00:05:51.660
Is anything wrong?

75
00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:52.541
No.

76
00:05:54.531 --> 00:05:55.944
What do you wanna do?

77
00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:57.956
I thought we were
going to the game.


78
00:06:01.978 --> 00:06:03.206
What's the matter?

79
00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:05.152
Steven?

80
00:06:06.552 --> 00:06:07.520
You wanna just...

81
00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:09.077
go some other time?

82
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:16.207
You don't wanna see me anymore.

83
00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:18.687
No. I didn't say that.

84
00:06:19.343 --> 00:06:21.117
It's just...

85
00:06:21.142 --> 00:06:22.452
I don't know.

86
00:06:23.264 --> 00:06:25.269
Maybe we should just start
seeing other people.


87
00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:27.037
This always happens to me.

88
00:06:27.062 --> 00:06:28.795
Why does this always happen to me?

89
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.310
I let myself get involved,
I wind up getting hurt.


90
00:06:31.335 --> 00:06:32.480
Caroline...

91
00:06:32.774 --> 00:06:34.708
What did I do that was so wrong?

92
00:06:34.741 --> 00:06:36.202
Caroline, don't say that.

93
00:06:36.227 --> 00:06:37.749
You didn't do anything wrong.

94
00:06:37.774 --> 00:06:39.735
It's me. I just...

95
00:06:40.482 --> 00:06:41.653
I don't know.
It's...


96
00:06:44.536 --> 00:06:45.236
Come here.

97
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.193
No.

98
00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:48.124
Caroline...

99
00:06:48.361 --> 00:06:49.360
Come here.

100
00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:51.317
Come on.

101
00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:55.484
Oh...

102
00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:56.545
Don't cry.

103
00:06:56.784 --> 00:06:58.306
Don't leave me.

104
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.399
Oh...

105
00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:06.269
Ah...

106
00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:08.840
I'm going inside.

107
00:07:10.392 --> 00:07:11.746
Why don't I call you later?

108
00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:14.339
No. Don't.
Just leave me alone.


109
00:07:14.442 --> 00:07:15.717
Caroline...

110
00:07:15.742 --> 00:07:17.459
I didn't mean to hurt you.

111
00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:20.061
Yeah.

112
00:07:20.086 --> 00:07:21.398
Well, you did.

113
00:07:47.027 --> 00:07:49.139
Did he tell you why?

114
00:07:49.164 --> 00:07:52.902
No. He just said we should
start seeing other people.


115
00:07:53.782 --> 00:07:55.100
He's a jerk.

116
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:58.020
He coulda at least told you why.

117
00:07:58.541 --> 00:07:59.176
Forget it.

118
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:01.152
I don't feel like
talking about it anymore.


119
00:08:01.177 --> 00:08:02.357
Talk about what?

120
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:05.666
Steven broke up
with Caroline today.


121
00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:07.447
Steve... Which one was Steve?

122
00:08:07.472 --> 00:08:08.991
The one with the
fig tree insured?


123
00:08:09.016 --> 00:08:10.194
No. That was Jackie.

124
00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:12.127
Steven was the one
that had the sick mother.


125
00:08:12.152 --> 00:08:14.008
No. That was Bob.

126
00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:15.251
And His mother got better.

127
00:08:15.276 --> 00:08:16.802
And that's when he dumped me.

128
00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:18.993
So Jackie's the one with the fig tree?

129
00:08:19.018 --> 00:08:20.437
No. That was Mike.

130
00:08:21.535 --> 00:08:22.599
Mike?

131
00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:26.671
I'm gonna call him.

132
00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:29.165
Caroline, don't you dare!

133
00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:32.047
My God, the guy
broke up with you!


134
00:08:32.497 --> 00:08:33.849
You gotta let them call you.

135
00:08:33.874 --> 00:08:36.607
Anyway, this guy is a jerk, ok?

136
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.213
You watch.

137
00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:42.230
I bet he's gonna come crawling back
on his knees saying,


138
00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:45.506
"oh, Caroline, I miss you.
I want you back."


139
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:47.253
Yeah.
Like they all do.


140
00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:49.155
Caroline, you're too good
to these jerks.


141
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.954
You gotta learn to
put your foot down.


142
00:08:50.979 --> 00:08:52.642
You got too good a heart.

143
00:08:52.873 --> 00:08:55.740
As long as you let 'em walk all over you,
that's what they do.


144
00:08:55.773 --> 00:08:59.642
What scares me is when someone
as screwed-up as these guys are,


145
00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:01.003
doesn't want me.

146
00:09:01.538 --> 00:09:02.878
Come on, ladies,
we're getting busy now.


147
00:09:02.903 --> 00:09:04.526
You've taken too many breaks.
Let's go, come on!


148
00:09:04.551 --> 00:09:05.575
Just like that.

149
00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:08.342
Why does he whistle at us
like we're dogs.


150
00:09:08.718 --> 00:09:10.081
Does he ever go home?

151
00:09:10.364 --> 00:09:11.406
All right.

152
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:12.509
I'm going.

153
00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:14.538
I'm going!

154
00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:17.731
I'll see you tomorrow night.

155
00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:19.232
Working tomorrow night, hon?

156
00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:20.079
Yep.

157
00:09:20.104 --> 00:09:21.441
I'll be here.

158
00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:22.286
Okay.

159
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:23.636
Well, you now what?

160
00:09:23.661 --> 00:09:24.974
Walk safely home, okay?

161
00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:26.910
There's a lot of
crazies out there.


162
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.327
I'll see you later.

163
00:09:32.666 --> 00:09:34.113
Caroline,

164
00:09:35.962 --> 00:09:37.025
He's a jerk.

165
00:09:45.597 --> 00:09:47.884
Adam, clean-up on table 7.

166
00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:51.008
Adam.

167
00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:53.018
Adam!

168
00:10:03.106 --> 00:10:05.994
...and held off
the hard-charging redwings in a game...


169
00:10:07.128 --> 00:10:08.078
Uh...

170
00:10:11.303 --> 00:10:12.111
Ohh...

171
00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:19.494
Here they come, you guys.

172
00:10:20.938 --> 00:10:22.389
Hey, chip, congratulations.

173
00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:23.284
- How's it going?
- Thanks, buddy.


174
00:10:23.309 --> 00:10:24.756
Hey, Jody. How's your dad?
- Hi!


175
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:26.015
Come on in.

176
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.799
There's cake, ice cream, champagne.
Make yourselves at home.


177
00:10:36.005 --> 00:10:38.673
John, where the hell's
my tuna melt?


178
00:10:38.698 --> 00:10:39.500
I'm working on it.

179
00:10:39.527 --> 00:10:41.172
Yeah? Well, you're gonna have to
work a little harder.


180
00:10:41.205 --> 00:10:43.610
This guy's having
a heart attack over here.


181
00:10:45.595 --> 00:10:47.707
Can you send Adam
over to table 5?


182
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.321
Okay, Cindy.

183
00:10:48.346 --> 00:10:49.221
Thank you.

184
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.381
Okay.

185
00:10:54.577 --> 00:10:55.483
Oh, great.

186
00:10:55.508 --> 00:10:56.407
No, wait.

187
00:10:56.432 --> 00:10:58.134
That's Cindy's tuna melt.

188
00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.149
It's all right.

189
00:11:01.236 --> 00:11:02.197
Here you go.

190
00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:03.678
Finally.

191
00:11:03.703 --> 00:11:04.720
Here you are.

192
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.101
- Caroline?  
- Here you are.

193
00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:09.144
Yes?

194
00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:10.170
Where's Adam?

195
00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:11.563
- I don't know. 
- Well, go back and find him!

196
00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:13.183
Tell him to get his butt out here.
I need him.


197
00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:15.175
Hey, don't cut the cake yet.
Let me get a picture.


198
00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:16.796
Hey, Caroline.

199
00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:17.786
Not now.

200
00:11:21.649 --> 00:11:22.582
Oh.

201
00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:24.954
Adam, you cut yourself.

202
00:11:24.979 --> 00:11:26.332
Let me see.

203
00:11:26.777 --> 00:11:28.753
Oh, my God, this is pretty deep.

204
00:11:28.778 --> 00:11:30.287
You might need stitches.

205
00:11:30.312 --> 00:11:31.950
Hold it like this.

206
00:11:31.975 --> 00:11:33.829
I'll put a bandage on it.

207
00:11:34.438 --> 00:11:35.343
You...

208
00:11:35.368 --> 00:11:37.616
Oh, keep it up because...

209
00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:40.167
You know what? Let me wash it off first.
Come with me


210
00:11:40.192 --> 00:11:42.149
I wanna rinse it off.

211
00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:45.886
If it doesn't stop bleeding, then...

212
00:11:45.911 --> 00:11:48.800
well, maybe Jim can take you
over to the hospital.


213
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.084
Ohh.

214
00:11:54.593 --> 00:11:55.606
Oh...

215
00:11:56.285 --> 00:11:58.026
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

216
00:11:58.382 --> 00:12:00.015
Ohh...

217
00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:07.863
What do you have
all over your hands?


218
00:12:08.213 --> 00:12:09.467
Is that...

219
00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:11.171
Syrup or...

220
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.212
Sap.

221
00:12:14.705 --> 00:12:18.168
You work at that Christmas tree lot
during the day, don't you?


222
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.323
Yeah, yeah, I've seen you there...

223
00:12:23.628 --> 00:12:25.786
hauling trees once or twice.

224
00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:29.584
You smell like a pine tree...

225
00:12:30.263 --> 00:12:31.653
like a Christmas tree.

226
00:12:31.678 --> 00:12:33.773
Maybe I'll stick a star
on your head, huh?


227
00:12:34.957 --> 00:12:36.147
Just kidding.

228
00:12:38.474 --> 00:12:42.296
(I) used to love the way our Christmas
tree smelled when we were little.


229
00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:45.692
Ah, brings back memories, you know,

230
00:12:45.717 --> 00:12:47.306
when life was simple.

231
00:12:48.714 --> 00:12:51.889
Now my parents put up
this stupid artificial tree.


232
00:12:51.914 --> 00:12:53.059
It's all fake.

233
00:12:53.084 --> 00:12:56.570
Just... not the same,
you know?


234
00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:02.136
You just don't talk much, do you?

235
00:13:03.598 --> 00:13:06.002
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
make you talk to me.


236
00:13:06.027 --> 00:13:09.065
Could I have a waitress
out here, please?


237
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:09.866
Whoo.

238
00:13:11.181 --> 00:13:12.439
You'll live.

239
00:13:13.008 --> 00:13:14.371
I gotta get back to work.

240
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.158
Thanks.

241
00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:17.990
Come on...

242
00:13:20.961 --> 00:13:23.159
Why don't you go over there
to handle it?


243
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.426
You can do it.

244
00:13:28.097 --> 00:13:29.076
Hey.

245
00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:30.297
Hey!

246
00:13:30.322 --> 00:13:31.801
How'd you like
to pay for that machine?


247
00:13:31.826 --> 00:13:34.505
It just stole my damn
quarter, sweetheart.


248
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.232
Yeah, well, that's 'cause guys like you
pound on it all the time.


249
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.878
What's the matter with you?
It ain't your machine.


250
00:13:40.251 --> 00:13:43.361
As a matter of fact, it is.
So don't hit it anymore.


251
00:13:44.396 --> 00:13:45.243
Thank you.

252
00:13:45.268 --> 00:13:46.432
This your diner?

253
00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:49.320
No. Just my machine.
Just wait.


254
00:13:57.161 --> 00:13:59.882
It happens to be
a very good investment


255
00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:02.013
once it's all paid off.

256
00:14:02.858 --> 00:14:04.245
Now, what brand?

257
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.206
Marlboro.

258
00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:09.633
Lights.

259
00:14:15.532 --> 00:14:17.262
Oh, 100s, please.

260
00:14:22.365 --> 00:14:23.960
- Here. 
- Uh, it's great.

261
00:14:23.985 --> 00:14:26.094
You have a problem with it,
come to me next time.


262
00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:26.994
We will.

263
00:14:39.541 --> 00:14:41.534
How'd you like
to feel that, huh?


264
00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.068
She'd make a meal out of you. 
- Ooh!

265
00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:47.204
You know her?

266
00:14:47.635 --> 00:14:49.273
Don't you remember who that is?

267
00:14:49.298 --> 00:14:50.619
No. Who is she?

268
00:14:50.644 --> 00:14:52.396
Ah, well, just wait.

269
00:14:52.927 --> 00:14:53.968
You'll see.

270
00:14:54.609 --> 00:14:55.392
Hello.

271
00:14:55.417 --> 00:14:56.734
Do you fellows know what you want?

272
00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:57.569
Yes, we do.

273
00:14:57.594 --> 00:14:59.970
We would like to have
Caroline wait on us


274
00:14:59.995 --> 00:15:01.599
if you don't mind, because...

275
00:15:01.624 --> 00:15:03.213
well, we're gonna tip you both.

276
00:15:03.238 --> 00:15:04.144
Yeah.

277
00:15:06.536 --> 00:15:07.375
Thank you.

278
00:15:13.443 --> 00:15:14.615
Switch with me.

279
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.787
Those 2 guys in there,

280
00:15:16.812 --> 00:15:18.773
they're asking for Caroline.

281
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.397
Great.

282
00:15:21.306 --> 00:15:22.283
Look for Bill.

283
00:15:28.232 --> 00:15:29.147
Ready to order?

284
00:15:29.172 --> 00:15:29.931
Yeah.

285
00:15:29.956 --> 00:15:30.791
Hi.

286
00:15:31.501 --> 00:15:34.207
So, have you been to
any parties lately, Caroline?


287
00:15:35.712 --> 00:15:37.146
Do I know you?

288
00:15:37.865 --> 00:15:39.376
Well, I tell you, I know you.

289
00:15:39.737 --> 00:15:44.231
Dean Alabanasi's 4th of July party,
in the basement,


290
00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:45.745
sloe gin fizzes?

291
00:15:47.048 --> 00:15:48.178
Ohh.

292
00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:50.676
Yeah.
How's it going?


293
00:15:50.973 --> 00:15:52.276
Well, you know.

294
00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:53.258
It's going.

295
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.350
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

296
00:15:56.375 --> 00:15:57.487
Now I remember.

297
00:15:57.907 --> 00:16:00.092
God, that was embarrassing.

298
00:16:00.117 --> 00:16:01.711
Ah. Hah hah.

299
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.268
Good memory.

300
00:16:03.945 --> 00:16:05.149
It's my pleasure.

301
00:16:05.571 --> 00:16:08.702
Must've been barfing up stuff
your grandmother ate that night.


302
00:16:09.264 --> 00:16:12.435
Oh, I'm not an ogre that lives
under the cigarette machine.


303
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.612
Forget it, all right?

304
00:16:15.293 --> 00:16:17.620
Because we all
are just people here.


305
00:16:18.179 --> 00:16:18.816
Hmm?

306
00:16:18.841 --> 00:16:19.654
You know?

307
00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:21.647
Ok. We're not so bad.

308
00:16:21.672 --> 00:16:23.060
My name's Howard,

309
00:16:23.085 --> 00:16:24.065
you know, in case you've forgotten.

310
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.796
This here, this is Patsy.

311
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:26.464
Hi.

312
00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.122
Cigarette?

313
00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.939
No.

314
00:16:29.494 --> 00:16:30.985
Oh, yeah. Ok.

315
00:16:33.475 --> 00:16:34.318
Um...

316
00:16:34.924 --> 00:16:37.486
I tell you what, I'm gonna
have a cheeseburger deluxe,


317
00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:39.464
and I'll get steak, medium rare.

318
00:16:41.804 --> 00:16:45.077
And she's yelling
at the top of her lungs,


319
00:16:45.102 --> 00:16:49.502
"you motherf***ing,
lousy, filthy pig.


320
00:16:49.527 --> 00:16:53.765
"Your mother's a slut,
and your father's a ho'."


321
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.921
All of this.

322
00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:57.339
Right in front of
the sons of Italy hall.


323
00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:59.474
This girl...

324
00:16:59.499 --> 00:17:00.457
No class.

325
00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:04.052
You got a light?

326
00:17:10.983 --> 00:17:12.215
I mean,

327
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.635
he met her at a stop light.

328
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.674
You know?

329
00:17:16.315 --> 00:17:17.857
She looks like Pete Rose.

330
00:17:18.817 --> 00:17:21.317
You gonna commiserate
all night again, ladies?


331
00:17:22.126 --> 00:17:24.832
You are like wet sand...

332
00:17:24.857 --> 00:17:26.188
in my underwear.

333
00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:27.107
Ouch!

334
00:17:31.389 --> 00:17:32.950
Anyways...

335
00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:34.950
'D you call him?

336
00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:40.432
No.

337
00:17:42.618 --> 00:17:43.480
Really?

338
00:17:46.318 --> 00:17:47.217
That's good.

339
00:17:47.788 --> 00:17:48.996
That's real good.

340
00:17:53.055 --> 00:17:54.010
Here.

341
00:17:55.161 --> 00:17:56.394
Finish my cig for me.

342
00:17:57.112 --> 00:17:59.375
I gotta grab this guy
before he stiffs me.


343
00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:02.156
Talk to you later.

344
00:18:10.053 --> 00:18:11.329
Why don't you just pay me now,

345
00:18:11.354 --> 00:18:13.560
so we don't have
to worry about it later?

Hey, honey!

352
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:35.188
Hey, Caroline!

353
00:19:44.129 --> 00:19:46.117
God, you scared
the shit out of me.


354
00:19:46.504 --> 00:19:47.467
Sorry.

355
00:19:48.466 --> 00:19:50.084
You always drive like that?

356
00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:51.964
I'm really sorry.

357
00:19:53.913 --> 00:19:55.302
No more tables?

358
00:19:55.618 --> 00:19:56.248
Hmm?

359
00:19:56.273 --> 00:19:57.625
Got any burgers?

360
00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:00.607
This's what you guys do
at 4:00 in the morning?


361
00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:03.029
Here. Warm you up.

362
00:20:03.054 --> 00:20:04.962
Come on, Caroline.
Get inside the car.


363
00:20:05.483 --> 00:20:06.293
No, thanks.

364
00:20:06.318 --> 00:20:07.893
Come on.
Hang out with us.


365
00:20:07.918 --> 00:20:11.036
We could be kicked out of
every damn bar in Minneapolis.


366
00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:12.464
Nah. I'm going home.

367
00:20:12.489 --> 00:20:13.191
Home?

368
00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:15.137
Yep. I'm going home.
It's late.


369
00:20:15.162 --> 00:20:17.862
Late? Jesus!
This is early for us.


370
00:20:17.887 --> 00:20:18.981
Be careful!

371
00:20:20.938 --> 00:20:22.246
Wahoo!

372
00:20:52.309 --> 00:20:54.802
Hey, Caroline, hang on a second.

373
00:20:57.959 --> 00:20:59.519
You mind if we walk with you?

374
00:21:00.023 --> 00:21:01.021
I'm all right.

375
00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:03.952
Come on, it's late out.
Pretty girl like you?


376
00:21:03.977 --> 00:21:05.528
No. Really.
I'm all right.


377
00:21:05.553 --> 00:21:06.457
Good night.

378
00:21:07.085 --> 00:21:08.394
Hey, uh...

379
00:21:08.426 --> 00:21:11.278
listen, I got a question
I wanna ask you.


380
00:21:11.641 --> 00:21:14.738
How much can we get one of
those cigarette machines for?


381
00:21:14.763 --> 00:21:18.389
Because... Patsy and me, we were
thinking of getting one.


382
00:21:18.414 --> 00:21:19.307
Yeah.

383
00:21:20.849 --> 00:21:24.268
Uh, I think you can get one
for about 1500 used.


384
00:21:24.293 --> 00:21:25.756
That's what we paid.

385
00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:26.757
Oh, yeah, really?

386
00:21:26.782 --> 00:21:28.429
1500, huh?

387
00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:29.248
Huh.

388
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.450
Come on.
Take a shot.


389
00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:33.477
No. I'm really tired.

390
00:21:33.502 --> 00:21:35.556
I worked all night.
I got to get home.


391
00:21:35.581 --> 00:21:37.766
Come on. We ain't
gonna bite you.


392
00:21:38.918 --> 00:21:40.026
Hey, um...

393
00:21:40.051 --> 00:21:41.919
you ain't scared of us, are you?

394
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.742
No. I'm just tired.

395
00:21:44.767 --> 00:21:46.348
Oh, yeah.
That's right, because...


396
00:21:46.373 --> 00:21:48.095
You worked all night, right?

397
00:21:57.151 --> 00:21:58.947
Hey, Caroline.

398
00:21:58.972 --> 00:22:00.830
Do you like to fuck?

399
00:22:05.073 --> 00:22:06.188
This yours?

400
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:08.311
Just leave me alone.

401
00:22:10.003 --> 00:22:10.958
Here.

402
00:22:11.268 --> 00:22:12.410
Take it.

403
00:22:13.023 --> 00:22:14.285
Come on, take it.

404
00:22:17.046 --> 00:22:18.076
No?

405
00:22:20.136 --> 00:22:21.650
You forgot something.

406
00:22:23.615 --> 00:22:24.685
Caroline.

407
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.683
Hey, where'd you go off to, honey?

408
00:22:26.708 --> 00:22:28.887
I got your hat.
It's right here!


409
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.865
Hey, maybe she wants
the cherry Brandy.


410
00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.037
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:22:34.432 --> 00:22:35.557
Caroline!

412
00:22:37.413 --> 00:22:38.819
Here.
Go up that way.


413
00:22:38.844 --> 00:22:40.373
Go that way.
Go find her.


414
00:22:40.398 --> 00:22:41.704
Caroline, honey.

415
00:22:45.421 --> 00:22:47.522
Hey, come on.
It's ok.


416
00:22:47.547 --> 00:22:49.425
It's ok.
Calm down.


417
00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:54.324
Aah!

418
00:22:55.432 --> 00:22:56.384
Oh!

419
00:22:57.371 --> 00:22:58.512
Oh, God!

420
00:22:58.537 --> 00:22:59.576
Jesus!

421
00:22:59.601 --> 00:23:00.481
My nose!

422
00:23:00.506 --> 00:23:01.552
Help!

423
00:23:03.042 --> 00:23:04.174
Jesus!

424
00:23:04.199 --> 00:23:05.132
God!

425
00:23:16.653 --> 00:23:17.703
Where you going?

426
00:23:17.907 --> 00:23:19.606
Tryna get away from Howard?

427
00:23:23.397 --> 00:23:25.147
How-man, look who I found.

428
00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:29.454
I think you broke my nose.

429
00:23:32.091 --> 00:23:33.452
I'm sorry. What?
I...


430
00:23:34.865 --> 00:23:35.647
Good.

431
00:23:37.609 --> 00:23:38.615
Good?

432
00:23:38.944 --> 00:23:39.918
Huh?

433
00:23:43.614 --> 00:23:45.049
I'll show you good.

434
00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:47.494
Hey...

435
00:23:47.875 --> 00:23:48.743
Caroline,

436
00:23:48.768 --> 00:23:50.175
tell me something.

437
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:54.606
Did you really think that
you were better than me?


438
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.469
Did you?

439
00:24:02.004 --> 00:24:03.043
Okay?

440
00:24:03.611 --> 00:24:04.285
Shh.

441
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.788
How-man, what
are you doing?


442
00:24:05.823 --> 00:24:07.721
Patsy, quiet her down.

443
00:24:08.425 --> 00:24:09.228
Shh.

444
00:24:09.253 --> 00:24:10.638
Here, give me your hand.

445
00:24:12.385 --> 00:24:13.347
Ahh.

446
00:24:18.993 --> 00:24:21.077
See, Caroline.
See that?


447
00:24:21.476 --> 00:24:22.442
I hurt.

448
00:24:24.466 --> 00:24:26.526
Quiet. Patsy,
get her to be quiet.


449
00:24:26.551 --> 00:24:27.647
Shh.

450
00:24:30.431 --> 00:24:31.262
Aah!

451
00:24:31.287 --> 00:24:32.264
She bit me!

452
00:24:35.072 --> 00:24:35.867
Damn!

453
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:37.181
Jesus!

454
00:24:37.206 --> 00:24:37.843
Shut up.

455
00:24:37.868 --> 00:24:38.639
No!

456
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:40.633
Come on. Yeah.

457
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:42.561
Baby, yeah.

458
00:24:45.459 --> 00:24:46.404
Shut up!

459
00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:49.006
Take it easy, Howard.

460
00:24:49.031 --> 00:24:50.008
Shut up!

461
00:24:50.264 --> 00:24:52.708
Shut up!
Shut up Caroline!


462
00:24:55.362 --> 00:24:56.047
How-man,

463
00:24:56.072 --> 00:24:58.425
Jesus, Howard.
What the hell are we doing?


464
00:28:25.444 --> 00:28:28.981
See, what I'd like to do is take a little
pork rind and smear that on my lure.


465
00:28:29.006 --> 00:28:29.453
Sure.

466
00:28:29.478 --> 00:28:32.443
You know, I would recommend
the rat-lipped jig.


467
00:28:32.468 --> 00:28:36.048
Um, the problem with a rat-lipped jig
is that it sometimes catches


468
00:28:36.073 --> 00:28:37.310
you know, underwater growth and stuff.

469
00:28:37.335 --> 00:28:38.490
Well, I know, but...

470
00:28:38.515 --> 00:28:40.302
Oh, come on.

471
00:28:40.327 --> 00:28:40.977
Try it.

472
00:28:41.002 --> 00:28:43.624
Cindy, where's Caroline
again today?


473
00:28:43.649 --> 00:28:45.472
Oh, she called in sick.

474
00:28:45.497 --> 00:28:46.960
Called in sick?

475
00:28:46.985 --> 00:28:48.317
That's every day this week.

476
00:28:48.342 --> 00:28:49.569
She okay?

477
00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:50.749
Well, she called in sick.

478
00:28:50.774 --> 00:28:51.826
(If) she's sick, she's sick.

479
00:28:51.851 --> 00:28:53.049
What can I tell you?

480
00:28:53.074 --> 00:28:54.183
Anything serious?

481
00:28:54.208 --> 00:28:56.112
Yeah. She's sick of work.

482
00:28:56.745 --> 00:29:00.029
Wasn't this a private conversation
between you and me, Bill?


483
00:29:04.057 --> 00:29:05.052
Don't worry about it.

484
00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:07.898
I mean, I think she got the flu
or something, you know.


485
00:29:07.923 --> 00:29:09.445
She'll be in tomorrow.

486
00:29:22.144 --> 00:29:25.037
Hey. Here you go.
Merry Christmas.


487
00:29:26.194 --> 00:29:27.959
What would you like
for Christmas?


488
00:29:27.984 --> 00:29:28.881
A doll house.

489
00:29:28.906 --> 00:29:29.923
Ok.

490
00:29:29.948 --> 00:29:30.711
Good.

491
00:29:31.557 --> 00:29:33.816
Huh? We'll see you
Christmas morning, huh?


492
00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:34.796
Very good.

493
00:29:35.192 --> 00:29:37.037
Hi there.
What would you like?


494
00:30:17.968 --> 00:30:20.212
Okay.
I'll see you later.


495
00:30:22.049 --> 00:30:24.542
Michael, don't forget.
Pick me up at 2:00.


496
00:30:24.567 --> 00:30:26.143
2 A.M.?

497
00:30:26.168 --> 00:30:27.098
Yeah.

498
00:30:27.698 --> 00:30:29.812
I have to get up for school
in the morning.


499
00:30:29.837 --> 00:30:31.217
Michael, you wanted the car tonight.

500
00:30:31.242 --> 00:30:34.048
Don't make me wake up daddy,
because I'll kill you.


501
00:30:48.304 --> 00:30:49.393
Hey, Caroline.

502
00:30:50.755 --> 00:30:51.928
Welcome back.

503
00:30:52.165 --> 00:30:52.957
Thanks.

504
00:30:54.431 --> 00:30:55.414
Hi, Caroline.

505
00:30:55.439 --> 00:30:56.617
Where you been?

506
00:30:56.642 --> 00:30:57.749
Just been out.

507
00:31:17.188 --> 00:31:19.090
Hey, you missed all
the action here last night.


508
00:31:19.115 --> 00:31:20.078
Oh, yeah?

509
00:31:20.442 --> 00:31:21.500
What'd I miss?

510
00:31:21.525 --> 00:31:23.709
You remember
Bobby Las Vegas, don't you?


511
00:31:24.917 --> 00:31:26.401
With the motorcycle?

512
00:31:26.426 --> 00:31:28.744
Yeah, except he don't ride
the motorcycle no more.


513
00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:29.950
Yeah? What happened?

514
00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:33.561
Slid on a dead squirrel
going around a turn over by (someplace)


515
00:31:33.586 --> 00:31:34.623
Demolished the bike.

516
00:31:34.648 --> 00:31:35.838
Jesus.

517
00:31:36.985 --> 00:31:38.547
He was in here last night.

518
00:31:38.572 --> 00:31:40.758
Yeah, he got drunk as a dog
down the street.


519
00:31:40.783 --> 00:31:42.474
He tried to run through
Lowry Hill tunnel,


520
00:31:42.499 --> 00:31:45.280
except he passed out
halfway through 'cause the car...


521
00:31:45.305 --> 00:31:46.857
So they brought him in here.

522
00:31:46.882 --> 00:31:49.154
He was in the bathroom
throwing up all night.


523
00:31:50.547 --> 00:31:52.636
Yeah. I'm really
sorry I missed that.


524
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:54.454
Yeah, only Bobby, huh?

525
00:31:57.864 --> 00:31:58.727
So, Caroline,

526
00:31:58.752 --> 00:32:00.120
those 2 guys, you know?

527
00:32:00.145 --> 00:32:03.664
The one's that were bothering with the
machine the other night last week.


528
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.210
Yeah.

529
00:32:05.464 --> 00:32:07.674
Well, Jim seen one of them
over at St. Vincent's.


530
00:32:07.699 --> 00:32:09.808
Oh, yeah. I went down there
to see my cousin Lucy.


531
00:32:09.833 --> 00:32:13.486
Remember, she had that thing
with her wrist, gonna get operated?

532
00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:15.314
Anyway, I see him
out in the hallway.


533
00:32:15.339 --> 00:32:16.869
Man, was he worked!

534
00:32:16.894 --> 00:32:19.365
Ugh, his face was a mess.

535
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.468
Black eyes, bumps, bruises.

536
00:32:21.854 --> 00:32:23.979
Looked like he was hit
by a dump truck.


537
00:32:24.457 --> 00:32:26.519
I got to pick up Lucy
on Tuesday.


538
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.890
Come here.

539
00:32:28.829 --> 00:32:30.543
You've been following me home?

540
00:32:31.464 --> 00:32:33.163
How do you know where I live?

541
00:32:34.023 --> 00:32:35.074
Huh?

542
00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:36.436
Have you?

543
00:32:37.138 --> 00:32:39.453
Well? Have you?

544
00:32:43.826 --> 00:32:45.037
How's your hand?

545
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.586
Thank you.

546
00:32:52.652 --> 00:32:53.740
I know.

547
00:32:57.792 --> 00:33:00.422
That's as scared as I've
ever been in my whole life.


548
00:33:00.447 --> 00:33:03.413
Just get squirrels in my stomach
thinking about it.


549
00:33:07.714 --> 00:33:11.022
Guess I don't have to worry about
you telling anybody, huh?


550
00:33:12.731 --> 00:33:15.683
It's kind of a real
awkward thing for a girl.


551
00:33:19.338 --> 00:33:20.613
Well...

552
00:33:21.647 --> 00:33:24.255
Don't take this the wrong way...

553
00:33:24.949 --> 00:33:26.536
But thank you.

554
00:33:33.955 --> 00:33:36.169
I follow you home.

555
00:33:38.007 --> 00:33:39.644
You follow me home?

556
00:33:40.663 --> 00:33:41.872
I...

557
00:33:42.888 --> 00:33:44.086
What?

558
00:33:46.105 --> 00:33:47.672
I wasn't finished.

559
00:33:49.147 --> 00:33:50.209
Finish.

560
00:33:53.701 --> 00:33:56.220
I follow you home and...

561
00:33:56.245 --> 00:34:01.487
walk to make sure you're...

562
00:34:01.512 --> 00:34:02.644
safe.

563
00:34:03.301 --> 00:34:05.125
I've never seen you.

564
00:34:07.158 --> 00:34:09.317
Well, I stay pretty far behind.

565
00:34:12.236 --> 00:34:13.442
I'm sorry.

566
00:34:13.467 --> 00:34:14.971
Well...

567
00:34:16.003 --> 00:34:18.433
I mean, don't be sorry.
I just...


568
00:34:18.458 --> 00:34:20.126
I wasn't finished.

569
00:34:22.828 --> 00:34:23.846
Finish.

570
00:34:26.441 --> 00:34:28.456
I'm sorry that...

571
00:34:28.836 --> 00:34:30.876
I was late...

572
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.910
that night.

573
00:34:36.705 --> 00:34:38.141
I don't think I ever heard you speak,

574
00:34:38.166 --> 00:34:39.549
and when you do,

575
00:34:39.574 --> 00:34:42.654
you apologize to me
for saving me against...


576
00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.305
Oh, God knows
what coulda happened.


577
00:34:45.574 --> 00:34:48.142
I don't...
Why should I be surprised, right?


578
00:34:48.167 --> 00:34:50.464
My life is like watching
The Three Stooges in Spanish.


579
00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.668
I'm either being dumped
or being attacked.


580
00:34:53.776 --> 00:34:55.384
Don't hit the machine!

581
00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:00.179
I'm sorry.

582
00:35:00.204 --> 00:35:02.328
I don't even know
what I'm saying anymore.


583
00:35:02.353 --> 00:35:04.145
I'll talk to you
about this later.


584
00:35:05.202 --> 00:35:07.089
And I brought your coat back.

You sure you're all right
to come back to work, hon?


599
00:35:45.679 --> 00:35:48.106
Been looking a little
puffy these days.


600
00:35:48.457 --> 00:35:51.319
You sure it was the flu
and not something else?


601
00:35:51.615 --> 00:35:52.606
I'm all right.

602
00:35:53.916 --> 00:35:55.119
Just checking.

603
00:35:57.139 --> 00:35:58.933
What do you think about Adam?

604
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.337
(I) think he's very weird.

605
00:36:05.267 --> 00:36:06.972
Wonder what he thinks about.

606
00:36:08.543 --> 00:36:10.327
I don't think Adam
actually thinks.


607
00:36:10.352 --> 00:36:13.471
I mean, we're talking about
a man who hasn't spoken.


608
00:36:14.629 --> 00:36:15.423
So?

609
00:36:15.924 --> 00:36:17.314
So...

610
00:36:17.339 --> 00:36:19.333
You don't find that
a little weird?


611
00:36:20.473 --> 00:36:21.654
Look at him.

612
00:36:25.398 --> 00:36:27.414
He looks like a tumor
sitting over there.


613
00:36:27.439 --> 00:36:29.102
And his hair.
Oh, God!


614
00:36:29.127 --> 00:36:31.571
It just bothers me so much.

615
00:36:32.913 --> 00:36:36.539
You know, Lottie says
that he has ape parts in him.


616
00:36:36.564 --> 00:36:38.537
or something like that.
I don't know.


617
00:36:38.799 --> 00:36:41.606
Oh, my God. Lottie?

618
00:36:42.531 --> 00:36:43.809
What a story.

619
00:36:44.234 --> 00:36:45.452
Well, whatever.

620
00:36:47.474 --> 00:36:48.663
Too bad, though.

621
00:36:50.488 --> 00:36:52.008
He is kind of cute.

622
00:36:54.799 --> 00:36:56.161
I'd do him,

623
00:36:56.757 --> 00:36:58.777
if he just wasn't so dumb.

624
00:37:05.607 --> 00:37:07.572
So what are you
doing for Christmas?


625
00:37:09.159 --> 00:37:10.296
Uh...

626
00:37:11.257 --> 00:37:12.503
The usual.

627
00:37:12.788 --> 00:37:14.863
Grandparents coming over,

628
00:37:14.888 --> 00:37:17.041
sitting in front of the TV,

629
00:37:17.351 --> 00:37:19.300
looking at the stupid tree,

630
00:37:20.741 --> 00:37:21.907
giving me $10,

631
00:37:21.932 --> 00:37:24.155
asking me where my boyfriend is.

632
00:37:25.562 --> 00:37:26.899
Oh, hon.

633
00:37:27.811 --> 00:37:29.995
You know it's all right to feel
shitty this time of year.


634
00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.898
You know, everybody does.

635
00:37:33.015 --> 00:37:34.625
It's like, this is life.

636
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.470
And when you go through it long enough,

637
00:37:37.495 --> 00:37:39.810
you know what the flavor is,

638
00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:42.022
and it sure ain't vanilla.

639
00:37:51.259 --> 00:37:52.791
Why don't you come over
for Christmas?


640
00:37:52.816 --> 00:37:55.707
You know my daddy's always saying,
"what's wrong with Caroline?


641
00:37:55.732 --> 00:37:57.399
"You know, she misses us or what,

642
00:37:57.424 --> 00:37:58.934
or she hates us?"

643
00:38:00.429 --> 00:38:01.429
We'll see.

644
00:38:03.712 --> 00:38:05.195
We'll see, huh?
We'll see.


645
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.717
You know, I knew
you were gonna say that.


646
00:38:08.228 --> 00:38:09.426
Just forget the whole thing.

647
00:38:09.451 --> 00:38:10.767
You know, just forget it.

648
00:38:12.935 --> 00:38:14.501
You got a problem.

649
00:38:14.938 --> 00:38:17.950
You really got to learn
to follow through with things.


650
00:38:17.975 --> 00:38:20.647
I mean, you never
finish anything you start.


651
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:23.579
I finish.

652
00:38:23.852 --> 00:38:24.934
Oh, yeah?

653
00:38:24.959 --> 00:38:26.970
Did you finish beauty school?

654
00:38:28.202 --> 00:38:30.773
I got a practical exam
in 2 weeks.


655
00:38:31.277 --> 00:38:33.618
Yeah? What about
the flower shop?


656
00:38:33.643 --> 00:38:35.244
What happened to the opening?

657
00:38:35.439 --> 00:38:37.951
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

658
00:38:38.433 --> 00:38:39.728
You know what, Caroline?

659
00:38:39.753 --> 00:38:41.689
Let me give you
your first lesson.


660
00:38:42.231 --> 00:38:44.205
Why don't you finish this, cousin?

661
00:38:46.973 --> 00:38:47.784
Bitch.

662
00:38:54.495 --> 00:38:55.484
Wench.

663
00:38:57.229 --> 00:38:58.032
Slut.

664
00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:05.642
Douche bag.

665
00:39:11.922 --> 00:39:14.846
You better go do your sugars
before I sic Jim on you.


666
00:39:15.262 --> 00:39:16.216
Jim!

667
00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.832
Jim! Caroline's
screwing off again!


668
00:39:23.616 --> 00:39:24.484
Jim!

669
00:39:47.964 --> 00:39:48.953
Hi.

670
00:39:54.344 --> 00:39:57.389
Can always measure your tips.
by your sugar jars.


671
00:39:58.094 --> 00:40:00.949
Come 3 A.M.,
I see empty sugar jars, and...


672
00:40:01.579 --> 00:40:03.604
You know I've got good tips.

673
00:40:07.517 --> 00:40:09.128
You like hockey?

674
00:40:09.153 --> 00:40:10.044
Hmm?

675
00:40:13.298 --> 00:40:14.812
Ever been to a game?

676
00:40:14.837 --> 00:40:15.769
No.

677
00:40:16.495 --> 00:40:18.767
Maybe we could go
to a game sometime.


678
00:40:21.456 --> 00:40:23.607
You took my bandage off.

679
00:40:25.922 --> 00:40:27.298
It's ok.

680
00:40:28.197 --> 00:40:30.308
It's ok. It's ok.

681
00:40:34.843 --> 00:40:35.698
Bye.

682
00:40:54.455 --> 00:40:55.218
3 and a half.

683
00:40:55.243 --> 00:40:56.813
I thought the food was creative.

684
00:40:56.838 --> 00:40:58.461
I liked their most roast dishes.

685
00:40:58.486 --> 00:41:02.256
I like their Italians, their tiramisu,
or whatever it is that's...


686
00:41:02.281 --> 00:41:03.615
- Tiramisu yeah. 
- Ahh.

687
00:41:04.673 --> 00:41:07.917
If my brother ever shows up,
tell him I'm gonna kill him.


688
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.991
If you look up long enough,
you'll see a shooting star.


689
00:42:10.016 --> 00:42:10.999
Oh.

690
00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:13.745
Then they're not really stars.

691
00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.274
They're meteors, actually.

692
00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:16.614
Really?

693
00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:18.198
Falling to the earth.

694
00:42:19.428 --> 00:42:21.815
You can see them good
from this bridge here.


695
00:42:22.597 --> 00:42:23.561
Huh.

696
00:42:24.401 --> 00:42:26.409
There's the big dipper.

697
00:42:27.198 --> 00:42:29.746
There's the north star
and Venus.


698
00:42:30.971 --> 00:42:33.011
Come on.
I wanna show you something.


699
00:42:33.036 --> 00:42:33.979
All right.

700
00:42:37.516 --> 00:42:38.879
Uh, what's this?

701
00:42:47.675 --> 00:42:48.748
It's okay.

702
00:42:49.344 --> 00:42:50.866
This is where I live.

703
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.024
Oh.

704
00:42:59.499 --> 00:43:00.241
Oh.

705
00:43:00.266 --> 00:43:01.649
This is my dog.

706
00:43:03.141 --> 00:43:05.483
Hi. Hi.

707
00:43:06.868 --> 00:43:07.988
Good dog.

708
00:43:08.634 --> 00:43:09.869
What's her name?

709
00:43:09.902 --> 00:43:12.697
I don't know.
He never told me.


710
00:43:15.278 --> 00:43:18.394
You know, I don't mean to be rude to you
in your own place or anything,


711
00:43:18.419 --> 00:43:21.063
but you are a little
strange sometimes.


712
00:43:22.352 --> 00:43:24.227
Would you like some ice cream?

713
00:43:24.252 --> 00:43:25.702
Ice cream?

714
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.399
No, I... no.

715
00:43:32.656 --> 00:43:34.492
You read all these books?

716
00:43:36.486 --> 00:43:38.135
I don't sleep very well.

717
00:43:41.625 --> 00:43:43.526
Got a...

718
00:43:43.551 --> 00:43:45.569
cosy little apartment.

719
00:43:54.497 --> 00:43:55.877
You...

720
00:43:58.528 --> 00:44:00.158
This is from
last new year's Eve.


721
00:44:00.183 --> 00:44:04.121
Did you take this from
behind the counter at work?


722
00:44:10.307 --> 00:44:12.120
I better get going home.

723
00:44:12.789 --> 00:44:14.023
Oh...

724
00:44:14.428 --> 00:44:15.757
Thanks for everything.

725
00:44:21.335 --> 00:44:22.380
Uh...

726
00:44:25.203 --> 00:44:29.981
Well, tomorrow's Christmas Eve,
and I don't work the day after that, so...


727
00:44:31.519 --> 00:44:32.873
Merry Christmas.

728
00:45:14.565 --> 00:45:15.686
Ouh!

00:45:16.572 --> 00:45:17.743

I made them.

762
00:47:38.645 --> 00:47:40.907
Did you have a nice
Christmas yesterday?


763
00:47:44.814 --> 00:47:46.076
Can I come in?

764
00:47:57.557 --> 00:47:59.628
Great weather.
What do you think?


765
00:47:59.653 --> 00:48:01.455
Would you like some ice cream?

766
00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:04.084
You're on the ice cream,
aren't you?


767
00:48:04.459 --> 00:48:05.750
No, thanks.

768
00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:18.463
Well, I guess the cookies are
a little on the sugary side.


769
00:48:22.514 --> 00:48:23.683
So, uh...

770
00:48:24.464 --> 00:48:25.994
You were all alone
for Christmas.


771
00:48:26.019 --> 00:48:27.722
I shoulda
stopped over yesterday.


772
00:48:27.747 --> 00:48:29.551
I should have invited you over.

773
00:48:30.852 --> 00:48:31.828
But, uh...

774
00:48:32.868 --> 00:48:35.027
Guess you were already there.

775
00:48:37.536 --> 00:48:39.385
Thank you for the tree.

776
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:41.404
It's so beautiful.

777
00:48:41.429 --> 00:48:44.133
It really made my day
that you remembered.


778
00:48:48.162 --> 00:48:50.670
Did I come at a bad time?
Do you want me to go?


779
00:48:51.745 --> 00:48:52.835
No.

780
00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.238
Ok. Then I'll stay.

781
00:48:57.349 --> 00:49:01.009
I'm not even gonna ask
how you got into our house.


782
00:49:11.338 --> 00:49:13.260
Do you like music, Caroline?

783
00:49:13.534 --> 00:49:14.589
Mm-hmm.

784
00:49:21.783 --> 00:49:23.566
I never heard you say
my name before.


785
00:49:23.591 --> 00:49:25.500
It sounded nice.

786
00:49:27.805 --> 00:49:30.318
Would you like to see
my records, Caroline?


787
00:49:30.343 --> 00:49:31.426
Caroline?

788
00:49:33.007 --> 00:49:33.853
Sure.

789
00:49:49.049 --> 00:49:50.156
Wow.

790
00:49:54.035 --> 00:49:55.849
They look really old.

791
00:49:57.066 --> 00:49:58.474
They're magic.

792
00:49:59.683 --> 00:50:01.107
Yeah, magic.

793
00:50:01.132 --> 00:50:03.212
What kind of magic do they do?

794
00:50:05.053 --> 00:50:08.366
In the orphanage, mother Camilla
used to play them for me.


795
00:50:09.065 --> 00:50:13.607
I used to sit in the sunlight
near the window in her office,


796
00:50:13.632 --> 00:50:15.755
and I'd fall asleep to them.

797
00:50:16.895 --> 00:50:19.711
She... she gave them
to me when I left.


798
00:50:21.827 --> 00:50:24.302
Whenever my life
doesn't agree with me,


799
00:50:24.327 --> 00:50:28.332
I lie down, and I play
these records, and...


800
00:50:28.357 --> 00:50:30.678
the rain stops falling.

801
00:50:33.538 --> 00:50:35.798
Would you like to hear one?

802
00:50:35.823 --> 00:50:36.943
Mm-hmm.

803
00:51:12.234 --> 00:51:16.009
You must have...
loved her a lot,


804
00:51:16.034 --> 00:51:17.455
Mother Camilla.

805
00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:22.813
She...

806
00:51:23.585 --> 00:51:26.247
She's the one who told me
about my heart.


807
00:51:27.577 --> 00:51:29.438
What about your heart?

808
00:51:31.781 --> 00:51:33.247
I was...

809
00:51:33.272 --> 00:51:35.431
I was a very sick baby.

810
00:51:36.297 --> 00:51:38.222
My heart was very weak.

811
00:51:40.766 --> 00:51:43.394
My mother, she died
when I was born.


812
00:51:45.316 --> 00:51:48.796
She died in the jungle where
she and my father were living.


813
00:51:48.821 --> 00:51:50.225
In the jungle?

814
00:51:50.985 --> 00:51:53.019
My father was
a great adventurer.


815
00:51:53.378 --> 00:51:54.401
Mmm.

816
00:51:59.908 --> 00:52:01.718
One day...

817
00:52:02.111 --> 00:52:05.152
The great king
of the silver baboons


818
00:52:05.177 --> 00:52:09.259
came down from his peak high in
the mountaintops of Kilimanjaro.


819
00:52:09.983 --> 00:52:15.505
He caught my father stealing his treasure
out of a deep dark cave at the very bottom,


820
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:18.954
where magic rubies trickled down
from the top of the mountain.


821
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:27.053
After a terrible battle
with the baboon king,


822
00:52:27.078 --> 00:52:29.695
my father was wounded
and left to die.


823
00:52:32.112 --> 00:52:36.264
And the great king later learned that
my father needed the enchanted rubies


824
00:52:36.289 --> 00:52:39.251
to heal his son with a dying heart,

825
00:52:40.434 --> 00:52:45.800
he was so overwhelmed with guilt and shame
and what he had done that...


826
00:52:45.825 --> 00:52:50.503
he took his own beating heart
right from his mighty baboon chest,


827
00:52:50.528 --> 00:52:52.289
and placed it in mine.

828
00:52:55.768 --> 00:52:58.262
Mother Camilla
told you all this?


829
00:53:01.532 --> 00:53:02.932
And you believe her?

830
00:53:07.459 --> 00:53:09.759
And you tell this to people?

831
00:53:13.983 --> 00:53:15.252
Oh, no.

832
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.837
It's a nice story.

833
00:53:23.474 --> 00:53:25.308
It stopped raining.

834
00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:44.396
Magic records
and a baboon heart.


835
00:53:45.914 --> 00:53:48.581
You almost got me
believing in it.


836
00:53:53.487 --> 00:53:55.910
How'd you like me
to cut your hair?


837
00:54:18.702 --> 00:54:20.155
It's ok.
No one's home.


838
00:54:25.937 --> 00:54:28.781
Mind if I ask
who cuts this thing?


839
00:54:29.429 --> 00:54:30.589
I do.

840
00:54:31.095 --> 00:54:32.597
I see.

841
00:54:33.535 --> 00:54:35.371
Mind if I ask something else?

842
00:54:35.396 --> 00:54:36.171
Ouch.

843
00:54:36.961 --> 00:54:37.805
Sorry.

844
00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:46.451
Did you ever think of doing anything else
with your life besides busboy, huh?


845
00:54:47.361 --> 00:54:51.144
I mean, you must've had
an education at the orphanage.


846
00:54:52.705 --> 00:54:54.842
I'm... not very good
with people.


847
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:58.466
Oh, don't let people
stand in your way.


848
00:54:58.491 --> 00:55:01.456
They're only people
just like you and me.


849
00:55:02.533 --> 00:55:03.631
Well...

850
00:55:04.178 --> 00:55:05.374
Maybe not like you.

851
00:55:05.399 --> 00:55:08.663
I don't know if I've ever
met anyone like you.


852
00:55:13.855 --> 00:55:14.777
Mmm.

853
00:55:15.836 --> 00:55:20.958
The first I can remember,
I was 4 years old...


854
00:55:20.983 --> 00:55:23.044
And?

855
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:27.607
I wasn't allowed
any physical contact or...


856
00:55:27.632 --> 00:55:30.306
even allowed to go out in public.

857
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:32.895
Why?

858
00:55:33.989 --> 00:55:35.899
My health was still poor.

859
00:55:36.621 --> 00:55:40.121
(It's) Just the risk of infection...

860
00:55:42.994 --> 00:55:47.382
People were so used to staying away from me
that they always stayed away.


861
00:55:50.369 --> 00:55:52.466
I never got close to people.

862
00:55:55.287 --> 00:55:56.317
Jeez!

863
00:55:56.853 --> 00:55:59.899
That's got to be hard on a kid,

864
00:55:59.924 --> 00:56:05.051
not being held or being allowed
to hold anyone.


865
00:56:10.776 --> 00:56:12.907
Well, what does your father do?

866
00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:17.170
Uh...

867
00:56:17.867 --> 00:56:20.666
actually, my step-dad.

868
00:56:23.904 --> 00:56:25.279
"Step to the rear."

869
00:56:26.542 --> 00:56:27.960
He's a bus driver.

870
00:56:28.858 --> 00:56:31.774
MTC between Minneapolis
and St. Paul.


871
00:56:32.142 --> 00:56:33.428
A really good guy.

872
00:56:33.453 --> 00:56:35.111
You should meet him sometime.

873
00:56:35.402 --> 00:56:37.314
He's on candid camera once.

874
00:56:37.339 --> 00:56:40.526
They locked him in a closet.
He was really great about it.


875
00:56:42.226 --> 00:56:47.101
My real dad is like oil and vinegar
with everybody.


876
00:56:47.126 --> 00:56:49.260
He just don't mix.

877
00:56:51.807 --> 00:56:54.418
Cindy says screw him.

878
00:56:56.263 --> 00:56:59.097
Well, first guy
to walk out of my life,


879
00:56:59.122 --> 00:57:01.165
certainly not the last.

880
00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:04.092
Weird, huh?

881
00:57:04.118 --> 00:57:08.292
You're always staying away from love,
I'm always chasing love.


882
00:57:08.706 --> 00:57:09.951
Weird.

883
00:57:44.432 --> 00:57:45.486
Come on.

884
00:57:47.782 --> 00:57:48.800
Come on.

885
00:59:06.268 --> 00:59:07.269
Here.

886
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:49.794
Are you crying?

887
00:59:51.281 --> 00:59:53.646
Oh. Ok.

888
00:59:55.412 --> 00:59:56.576
It's ok.

889
01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:13.622
I'm gonna fall in love with you.

890
01:00:15.835 --> 01:00:17.991
You don't have to love me back.

891
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.831
I'm gonna give you my heart.

892
01:00:26.337 --> 01:00:27.483
Ok?

893
01:00:28.271 --> 01:00:29.324
Ok.

894
01:01:13.888 --> 01:01:16.721
Um, my parents are having
a new year's Eve party.


895
01:01:16.746 --> 01:01:18.107
Uh...

896
01:01:18.666 --> 01:01:20.231
My brother will be there,

897
01:01:20.256 --> 01:01:23.455
with whoever might be
his girlfriend at that moment.


898
01:01:25.484 --> 01:01:26.836
Do you wanna come?

899
01:01:28.745 --> 01:01:31.852
You don't have to come as my boyfriend
or anything like that.


900
01:01:31.877 --> 01:01:33.559
Uh...

901
01:01:34.577 --> 01:01:36.341
Though I'd like you to.

902
01:01:40.816 --> 01:01:41.710
Is that a yes?

903
01:01:41.735 --> 01:01:42.638
Mmm. Yes.

904
01:01:42.663 --> 01:01:43.577
Yes?

905
01:01:44.462 --> 01:01:45.436
Say yes again.

906
01:01:45.461 --> 01:01:46.004
Yes.

907
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:47.023
Yes?

908
01:01:47.419 --> 01:01:49.861
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

909
01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:58.870
Nice kitty.

910
01:02:00.197 --> 01:02:01.523
Nice kitty.

911
01:02:10.537 --> 01:02:11.112
Bye.

912
01:02:11.137 --> 01:02:12.150
Adam.

913
01:02:13.808 --> 01:02:15.560
What are you doing out here?

914
01:02:17.179 --> 01:02:18.924
When did you get here?

915
01:02:19.477 --> 01:02:20.500
10:00.

916
01:02:21.426 --> 01:02:22.614
10:00?

917
01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:25.621
That was almost 2 hours ago.

918
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:29.762
You'd rather be out here
with my cat than


919
01:02:29.787 --> 01:02:35.673
inside with... a roomful of
strangers and relatives?


920
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:40.866
Adam.

921
01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.487
Ohh...

922
01:02:48.484 --> 01:02:49.663
"Star light, star bright,

923
01:02:49.688 --> 01:02:50.880
"first star I see tonight,

924
01:02:50.905 --> 01:02:52.100
"I wish I may, 
I wish I might.

925
01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:54.300
Have this wish
I wish tonight."


926
01:02:55.962 --> 01:02:57.296
That's Mars.

927
01:02:59.287 --> 01:03:00.276
What?

928
01:03:02.122 --> 01:03:03.408
That's Mars.

929
01:03:04.074 --> 01:03:06.163
You just wished on a planet.

930
01:03:06.188 --> 01:03:08.593
5... 4... 3...

931
01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:09.350
Vacuous.

932
01:03:09.375 --> 01:03:11.128
2... 1...

933
01:03:11.153 --> 01:03:13.591
Happy new year!

934
01:03:21.142 --> 01:03:25.246
♪ Should auld acquaintance
be forgot... ♪


935
01:03:25.988 --> 01:03:27.523
You can kiss me.

936
01:03:47.598 --> 01:03:48.713
More.

937
01:03:59.259 --> 01:04:00.988
I'm gonna get a soda!

938
01:04:03.228 --> 01:04:05.610
You know Nick's friend
Ronnie, he's a cop?


939
01:04:05.635 --> 01:04:06.605
No.

940
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:07.726
Yes, you do.

941
01:04:07.751 --> 01:04:11.119
He's the one whose half-sister
bought the house down by north shore?


942
01:04:11.144 --> 01:04:12.871
I never met him, though.

943
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:14.636
Anyway, look.

944
01:04:14.661 --> 01:04:16.495
I want you to double with us, okay?

945
01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.029
We're gonna go to the fountain.
You know, go dancing, have some fun.


946
01:04:19.054 --> 01:04:20.264
You should come.

947
01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:21.661
Mmm...

948
01:04:22.153 --> 01:04:24.081
I don't think I can.

949
01:04:24.957 --> 01:04:25.906
Why not?

950
01:04:28.022 --> 01:04:30.709
Well, I'm sort of
seeing somebody.


951
01:04:33.554 --> 01:04:34.539
Yeah?

952
01:04:34.564 --> 01:04:35.731
You are?

953
01:04:36.278 --> 01:04:37.191
Who?

954
01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.097
Come on, you little shit,
tell me who!


955
01:04:43.482 --> 01:04:45.040
Oh, forget it.

956
01:04:45.563 --> 01:04:46.792
It's Adam.

957
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.507
Adam who?

958
01:04:48.912 --> 01:04:50.497
Adam from work.

959
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.876
Adam Adam?

960
01:04:55.901 --> 01:04:58.046
And you're just telling me
this shit now?


961
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:00.006
You freaking liar.

962
01:05:00.031 --> 01:05:02.049
I'm not lying.
It's Adam.


963
01:05:02.074 --> 01:05:03.211
Uh-uh.

964
01:05:04.761 --> 01:05:05.817
Why?

965
01:05:07.198 --> 01:05:09.778
'Cause I got to know him.

966
01:05:10.751 --> 01:05:12.298
And we make sense.

967
01:05:12.323 --> 01:05:14.454
What do you mean,
"we make sense"?


968
01:05:15.026 --> 01:05:17.196
He doesn't make sense,
I don't make sense.


969
01:05:17.221 --> 01:05:19.017
Together, we make sense.

970
01:05:24.573 --> 01:05:26.237
So...

971
01:05:27.022 --> 01:05:28.447
Tell me what he's like.

972
01:05:28.472 --> 01:05:30.629
I mean, does he actually speak?

973
01:05:31.096 --> 01:05:32.417
Did you meet his family yet?

974
01:05:32.442 --> 01:05:34.166
I mean, what's up with this?

975
01:05:34.785 --> 01:05:36.660
Yeah, he speaks.

976
01:05:37.373 --> 01:05:39.647
No, I haven't met his family.

977
01:05:40.805 --> 01:05:42.442
He's an orphan.

978
01:05:42.467 --> 01:05:43.502
Really?

979
01:05:43.908 --> 01:05:45.027
No shit?

980
01:05:45.052 --> 01:05:46.891
I never met a real
orphan before.


981
01:05:46.916 --> 01:05:47.968
Yeah.

982
01:05:49.157 --> 01:05:51.544
He's a lot smarter
than people think.


983
01:05:51.569 --> 01:05:53.719
He reads a lot,
got a lot of books.


984
01:05:55.447 --> 01:05:57.327
He's really into his music.

985
01:05:57.775 --> 01:05:58.676
Really?

986
01:05:59.222 --> 01:06:00.538
He's really sweet.

987
01:06:01.276 --> 01:06:04.318
He's like a kid, but it's nice.

988
01:06:09.173 --> 01:06:10.472
He's got...

989
01:06:10.879 --> 01:06:12.827
He thinks he's got...

990
01:06:12.852 --> 01:06:14.845
(He) thinks he's got
a baboon's heart.


991
01:06:15.327 --> 01:06:17.466
You see, Caroline?
You see?


992
01:06:17.491 --> 01:06:19.788
I told you this man
had ape parts in him.


993
01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:20.817
I told you!

994
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:22.880
He doesn't have ape parts in him.

995
01:06:22.905 --> 01:06:26.618
It's just a story one of those nuns at
that orphanage told a scared little boy


996
01:06:26.643 --> 01:06:27.942
who didn't know why he was so scared.

997
01:06:27.967 --> 01:06:30.167
He's got some kind
of a heart problem.


998
01:06:30.908 --> 01:06:31.839
But Adam?

999
01:06:32.507 --> 01:06:35.557
You know you don't have to
sell yourself short either, you know.


1000
01:06:38.033 --> 01:06:40.113
Well, there's something
you don't know.


1001
01:06:40.426 --> 01:06:41.283
What?

1002
01:06:43.014 --> 01:06:45.146
You know when I was out sick?

1003
01:06:45.779 --> 01:06:46.760
Yeah.

1004
01:06:57.471 --> 01:07:01.122
On the way home
in the park one night,

1005
01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:04.489
My God!

1006
01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:08.628
Oh, my God!
Caroline, are you okay?


1007
01:07:09.241 --> 01:07:09.941
Yeah.

1008
01:07:09.966 --> 01:07:12.472
Someone stopped them.
It was Adam.


1009
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:14.290
He saved me.

1010
01:07:15.836 --> 01:07:17.574
Why didn't you
tell me this, huh?


1011
01:07:17.599 --> 01:07:18.873
Why... why didn't
you come to me?


1012
01:07:18.898 --> 01:07:20.570
I didn't tell anybody.

1013
01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.774
Jesus, you poor thing.

1014
01:07:24.867 --> 01:07:27.159
Are you all right?
I mean seriously, are you okay?


1015
01:07:27.184 --> 01:07:27.930
Mm.

1016
01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:28.525
Yeah?

1017
01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.095
God, I don't believe this.

1018
01:07:35.696 --> 01:07:36.857
Oh, shit.

1019
01:07:37.191 --> 01:07:38.624
Shit, shit, shit!

1020
01:07:38.649 --> 01:07:39.746
What?

1021
01:07:40.419 --> 01:07:41.408
What?

1022
01:07:42.995 --> 01:07:45.371
You're gonna be so mad at me.

1023
01:07:46.645 --> 01:07:47.609
Why?

1024
01:07:48.235 --> 01:07:51.378
Well, I kind of told Nick that
you would double with Ronnie.


1025
01:07:52.044 --> 01:07:52.821
I...

1026
01:07:52.846 --> 01:07:55.132
Great.
Thanks a lot.


1027
01:07:56.001 --> 01:07:56.990
Ohh...

1028
01:07:57.015 --> 01:07:59.335
Look, you don't have to go, okay?

1029
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.525
I mean, you can just
forget the whole thing, okay?


1030
01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:03.245
Just forget it, ok?

1031
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:04.418
Well...

1032
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:05.869
Well, go anyway, ok?

1033
01:08:05.901 --> 01:08:07.163
Just go, Caroline.

1034
01:08:07.188 --> 01:08:10.138
I mean, you'll have a good time.
He's really nice.


1035
01:08:10.163 --> 01:08:13.011
His father owns a hardware
store downtown, you know?


1036
01:08:13.416 --> 01:08:15.542
And when's the last time
you went dancing, huh?


1037
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.397
And look, if you don't like him,

1038
01:08:18.422 --> 01:08:20.956
if he doesn't turn out
to be the glass slipper man,


1039
01:08:20.981 --> 01:08:22.761
you don't have
to see him anymore, okay?


1040
01:08:22.786 --> 01:08:24.023
I don't know.

1041
01:08:35.624 --> 01:08:37.508
My dad owns a hardware store.

1042
01:08:38.388 --> 01:08:39.495
What?

1043
01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.513
My dad, he owns
a hardware store.


1044
01:08:46.596 --> 01:08:48.732
If you ever need anything...

1045
01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:49.297
What?

1046
01:08:49.322 --> 01:08:51.375
If you ever need anything,
just let me know.


1047
01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.449
I'll take care of it.

1048
01:09:13.987 --> 01:09:15.454
Looks like we don't have
to wait for a seat.


1049
01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:16.520
Cindy.

1050
01:09:16.925 --> 01:09:17.762
What?

1051
01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:19.283
Can I talk to you?

1052
01:09:19.308 --> 01:09:20.530
- Nick. 
- Yeah.

1053
01:09:20.554 --> 01:09:21.536
Go find us a table.

1054
01:09:21.561 --> 01:09:22.414
- Ok.  
- Good.

1055
01:09:24.137 --> 01:09:26.238
What is wrong with you?

1056
01:09:26.527 --> 01:09:28.745
Cindy, I didn't wanna
go out with him.


1057
01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:30.034
I didn't know
we were gonna come here.


1058
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:32.840
This is terrible.

1059
01:09:32.865 --> 01:09:34.234
Let's just go.

1060
01:09:34.259 --> 01:09:35.240
Let's just go.

1061
01:09:35.265 --> 01:09:36.417
Why?

1062
01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:39.876
Why don't you just go tell Adam
that you're with friends?


1063
01:09:39.901 --> 01:09:42.633
I mean, you and me
went out dancing,


1064
01:09:42.658 --> 01:09:44.029
and that's all.

1065
01:09:44.312 --> 01:09:47.502
What, he's got that much
hold on you already?


1066
01:09:47.527 --> 01:09:48.691
No, that isn't it.

1067
01:09:48.716 --> 01:09:49.574
He's very sensitive,

1068
01:09:49.599 --> 01:09:52.460
and I don't know how he's gonna react,
to see me with this guy.


1069
01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:57.046
Well, look, why don't
you just go find Adam

1070
01:09:57.071 --> 01:09:59.785
and tell him that you and Ronnie
are just friends?


1071
01:10:01.567 --> 01:10:02.482
All right?

1072
01:10:04.257 --> 01:10:05.463
Well, go ahead.

1073
01:10:10.196 --> 01:10:12.208
Jim, where's Adam?

1074
01:10:12.839 --> 01:10:14.312
I don't know, look in back.

1075
01:10:37.361 --> 01:10:38.391
John, is Adam back here?

1076
01:10:38.416 --> 01:10:39.766
No. I haven't seen him.

1077
01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:43.861
Adam?

1078
01:10:57.394 --> 01:10:58.522
Adam?

1079
01:11:07.629 --> 01:11:08.580
Just coffee.

1080
01:11:08.605 --> 01:11:09.512
Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.


1081
01:11:09.537 --> 01:11:10.145
Ok. Have fun.

1082
01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:11.253
There's Caroline.

1083
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:13.539
Here. Sit.

1084
01:11:14.626 --> 01:11:15.875
I ain't gonna bite you.

1085
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.295
Man.

1086
01:11:26.872 --> 01:11:28.145
Come on, get up.

1087
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:29.176
Get off me!

1088
01:11:29.594 --> 01:11:30.998
Take this, tough guy.

1089
01:11:32.735 --> 01:11:33.733
All right!

1090
01:11:36.646 --> 01:11:37.509
Loser.

1091
01:12:13.558 --> 01:12:15.143
Whoo-hoo!

1092
01:12:21.492 --> 01:12:22.558
Oh, my God!

1093
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:23.778
Jim!

1094
01:12:23.803 --> 01:12:24.714
Jim!

1095
01:12:26.295 --> 01:12:27.043
What's going on?

1096
01:12:27.068 --> 01:12:28.287
Oh, my God.

1097
01:12:28.312 --> 01:12:29.316
Adam...

1098
01:12:29.341 --> 01:12:30.316
Cindy!

1099
01:12:30.341 --> 01:12:31.727
I'm right here.
I'm right here.


1100
01:12:31.752 --> 01:12:33.149
Call an ambulance.

1101
01:12:33.174 --> 01:12:34.379
Call an ambulance!

1102
01:12:34.404 --> 01:12:35.186
Is he breathing?

1103
01:12:35.211 --> 01:12:36.158
What happened?

1104
01:12:36.934 --> 01:12:37.907
Has he been shot?

1105
01:12:37.932 --> 01:12:38.647
I don't know.

1106
01:12:38.672 --> 01:12:40.005
Somebody check the parking lot.

1107
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:41.236
I got it.

1108
01:12:45.538 --> 01:12:46.463
Nobody there.

1109
01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:22.769
I'm right here.

1110
01:13:23.178 --> 01:13:24.258
Right here.

1111
01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:26.111
You're going to be okay.

1112
01:13:52.017 --> 01:13:54.566
It's not the knife wound
that we're worried about.


1113
01:13:54.591 --> 01:13:56.545
It's his heart that
we're concerned with.


1114
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:57.722
His heart?

1115
01:13:57.747 --> 01:13:58.762
Yes.

1116
01:13:58.787 --> 01:14:01.715
It's not the normal heart
of a 26-year-old man.


1117
01:14:02.235 --> 01:14:04.290
Excuse me.
What did you say?


1118
01:14:05.183 --> 01:14:07.999
We know he has
a congenital defect,


1119
01:14:08.024 --> 01:14:10.839
and we do favor, at some point,

1120
01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:12.112
a transplant.

1121
01:14:12.713 --> 01:14:15.838
It's been left untreated
for far too long.


1122
01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:18.029
He should remain stable,

1123
01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:20.556
until a proper donor
is available.


1124
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.375
And how long can that take?

1125
01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.186
That we don't know.

1126
01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:29.647
He's sedated now, but...

1127
01:14:29.672 --> 01:14:31.835
he became very upset before.

1128
01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:35.580
When we were talking about going in
to relieve the pressure on his heart.


1129
01:14:35.605 --> 01:14:39.926
It took 2 orderlies, 2 nurses, and myself
jut to hold him down.


1130
01:14:39.951 --> 01:14:42.691
Frankly, we were surprised
that didn't kill him right there,


1131
01:14:42.716 --> 01:14:45.425
what with all the trauma
he's experienced this evening.


1132
01:14:45.450 --> 01:14:51.269
However, that's also a very good sign of hope
that he's more than strong enough,


1133
01:14:51.294 --> 01:14:56.016
and he can go on living for quite some time
with treatment for what he's got.


1134
01:14:57.621 --> 01:14:58.590
Good evening.

1135
01:14:58.615 --> 01:15:00.843
Are you with the lady in there?

1136
01:15:00.868 --> 01:15:01.738
Oh, yes.

1137
01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:02.798
She's my best friend.

1138
01:15:02.823 --> 01:15:03.640
Ok.

1139
01:15:05.178 --> 01:15:06.799
Number 5 and number 7.

1140
01:15:06.824 --> 01:15:07.978
You positive?

1141
01:15:09.153 --> 01:15:10.850
Number 5 and number 7.

1142
01:15:10.875 --> 01:15:11.689
Thank you, miss.

1143
01:15:11.714 --> 01:15:14.539
Just step over here and we'll get
the paperwork out of the way.


1144
01:16:14.159 --> 01:16:16.437
You're not taking off
too much, are you?


1145
01:16:16.762 --> 01:16:17.669
Nope.

1146
01:16:18.392 --> 01:16:20.026
I only wanted a trim.

1147
01:16:20.677 --> 01:16:22.347
Did you hear me, young lady?

1148
01:16:22.372 --> 01:16:24.334
Yep. I heard you.
You told me.


1149
01:16:29.983 --> 01:16:31.516
I can't believe
I got to do this today.


1150
01:16:31.541 --> 01:16:32.964
I got too much on my mind
right now.


1151
01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:34.255
I can't take this friggin' lady.

1152
01:16:34.287 --> 01:16:37.003
I know. Just
try to calm down.


1153
01:16:37.028 --> 01:16:39.793
You can't work miracles,
so just do what you can.


1154
01:16:39.818 --> 01:16:40.736
Hang tough.

1155
01:16:40.761 --> 01:16:43.853
You know, I know you're
being tested today.


1156
01:16:43.878 --> 01:16:46.917
I hope you're not trying
to impress anybody.


1157
01:16:46.942 --> 01:16:49.004
All I want is a trim.

1158
01:16:49.029 --> 01:16:52.088
It's too cold out yet
for short hair.


1159
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.128
Mm-hmm. Just keep
your head still.


1160
01:16:56.106 --> 01:16:59.322
Should we maybe involve
your instructor in this,


1161
01:16:59.347 --> 01:17:05.422
and she could make sure you don't make
a disaster area out of my hair, hmm?


1162
01:17:07.001 --> 01:17:08.654
Oh, why'd you stop?

1163
01:17:13.233 --> 01:17:15.121
You're not
butchering it, are you?


1164
01:17:15.325 --> 01:17:17.385
I wouldn't like
to have you butcher my hair.


1165
01:17:17.410 --> 01:17:18.825
Lady, I'm not
butchering your hair.


1166
01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:20.275
It's a free hair cut, all right?

1167
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.802
So stop bitching before I cut
it all off, you fat cow!


1168
01:17:25.124 --> 01:17:26.006
Thanks!

1169
01:17:41.989 --> 01:17:42.775
What?

1170
01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:45.257
Cindy, can you drive me
over to the hospital?


1171
01:17:45.282 --> 01:17:48.210
I don't have a car, nobody's home,
and I really wanna see Adam.


1172
01:17:50.673 --> 01:17:51.988
When do they open?

1173
01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.739
I... I don't know.

1174
01:17:59.516 --> 01:18:00.858
Never mind. He's here.

1175
01:18:00.883 --> 01:18:02.033
Adam!

1176
01:18:02.058 --> 01:18:04.295
Oh! Oh... oh...

1177
01:18:06.424 --> 01:18:07.940
What are you doing here?

1178
01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.724
I'm sorry.

1179
01:18:09.749 --> 01:18:11.334
I didn't mean to
upset you, Caroline.


1180
01:18:11.359 --> 01:18:12.665
Ohh...

1181
01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:14.328
Oh, I was so scared.

1182
01:18:15.277 --> 01:18:16.470
You okay?

1183
01:18:16.495 --> 01:18:17.972
Are you okay?

1184
01:18:17.997 --> 01:18:20.559
Come inside. You want me to
get you something to eat?


1185
01:18:20.591 --> 01:18:21.929
You want some breakfast?

1186
01:18:21.954 --> 01:18:22.726
No.

1187
01:18:23.246 --> 01:18:25.129
Your stitches, your stitches.

1188
01:18:25.154 --> 01:18:26.018
Ahh.

1189
01:18:26.043 --> 01:18:27.690
Oh, I bet you're sore.

1190
01:18:30.023 --> 01:18:33.251
Wait. I'm supposed to
be giving you flowers.


1191
01:18:34.783 --> 01:18:35.970
They're beautiful.

1192
01:18:37.694 --> 01:18:38.683
Ohh...

1193
01:18:39.986 --> 01:18:41.806
What'd the doctor say?

1194
01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:46.258
I'm not allowed to stick
knives in my stomach.


1195
01:18:46.853 --> 01:18:48.115
Very funny.

1196
01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.789
You could have been killed.

1197
01:18:50.188 --> 01:18:52.312
They caught the guys
who did it to you.


1198
01:18:53.654 --> 01:18:56.402
Do the police know
what they did to you?


1199
01:18:56.427 --> 01:18:58.973
Yeah.
I told them.


1200
01:18:59.432 --> 01:19:01.690
We'll probably both
have to go to court.


1201
01:19:05.059 --> 01:19:08.503
Did you... have
your beauty exam today?


1202
01:19:10.964 --> 01:19:12.294
Yeah, but...

1203
01:19:13.225 --> 01:19:14.475
It just...

1204
01:19:15.464 --> 01:19:18.039
Forget it. It's
just a stupid license.


1205
01:19:18.064 --> 01:19:19.964
I was no good at it, anyway.

1206
01:19:20.263 --> 01:19:21.426
Don't say that.

1207
01:19:25.668 --> 01:19:27.538
So...

1208
01:19:27.922 --> 01:19:31.017
The doctor told you you're gonna
have to have a transplant?


1209
01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:37.511
Adam.

1210
01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.506
No. They're wrong.

1211
01:19:39.531 --> 01:19:41.885
Adam, the heart you have
is diseased.


1212
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:44.165
No one is taking away my heart.

1213
01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:47.245
You were just a kid.
It was just a story.


1214
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:50.333
You're gonna die someday if
you don't do something about it.


1215
01:19:51.717 --> 01:19:53.698
This... this is my heart.

1216
01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.150
I don't want you to die.

1217
01:19:57.666 --> 01:19:58.997
I love you.

1218
01:20:03.022 --> 01:20:04.949
I was...

1219
01:20:05.999 --> 01:20:09.003
I was wondering
if you think about me...


1220
01:20:09.602 --> 01:20:11.626
Of course I think about you.

1221
01:20:13.564 --> 01:20:15.290
I wasn't finished.

1222
01:20:17.233 --> 01:20:18.449
Finish.

1223
01:20:20.787 --> 01:20:26.200
I was wondering if you think about me

1224
01:20:26.225 --> 01:20:29.030
half as much as I think about you.

1225
01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:51.188
I...

1226
01:20:51.748 --> 01:20:54.058
have to tell you something.

1227
01:20:58.083 --> 01:21:00.086
It might make you angry.

1228
01:21:01.167 --> 01:21:02.569
Look at me.

1229
01:21:07.501 --> 01:21:09.852
I watch you sleep sometimes.

1230
01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:16.291
The tree, it wasn't the first time
I was in your room...


1231
01:21:18.349 --> 01:21:19.739
or the last.

1232
01:21:22.826 --> 01:21:24.505
You come into my room?

1233
01:21:28.358 --> 01:21:30.290
From the basement
under the porch.


1234
01:21:33.293 --> 01:21:35.058
To watch me sleep?

1235
01:21:36.908 --> 01:21:38.172
Why?

1236
01:21:40.077 --> 01:21:43.070
'Cause you have peace.

1237
01:21:44.261 --> 01:21:45.259
I don't.

1238
01:21:47.904 --> 01:21:50.861
My sleep, it's always
the same dream.


1239
01:21:51.684 --> 01:21:53.776
A jungle,

1240
01:21:54.532 --> 01:21:57.199
dreary, twisted limbs,

1241
01:21:57.627 --> 01:22:00.088
strangling vines...

1242
01:22:01.078 --> 01:22:02.082
and rain.

1243
01:22:04.061 --> 01:22:06.005
Always the rain.

1244
01:22:10.005 --> 01:22:13.244
I feel suffocated,

1245
01:22:15.071 --> 01:22:16.503
despair.

1246
01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.325
Despair just trying to survive.

1247
01:22:22.223 --> 01:22:25.026
Despair and no peace.

1248
01:22:26.649 --> 01:22:28.273
I'm...

1249
01:22:28.298 --> 01:22:31.529
afraid if they take away
my heart, I...


1250
01:22:32.654 --> 01:22:35.646
I won't be able
to love you the same.


1251
01:22:37.345 --> 01:22:39.331
You are my peace.

1252
01:22:42.449 --> 01:22:43.792
Oh, my God.

1253
01:22:45.265 --> 01:22:51.098
You love with your mind and your soul,
not actually with your heart.


1254
01:22:51.123 --> 01:22:53.160
It's just a saying.

1255
01:22:58.249 --> 01:23:03.800
Why's it hurt so much here
when you're not with me?

Happy Birthday!

1316
01:25:39.135 --> 01:25:40.336
Come here.

1317
01:25:40.361 --> 01:25:42.176
You look beautiful.

1318
01:25:45.202 --> 01:25:47.418
You get this.

1319
01:25:48.293 --> 01:25:50.473
You get this.

1320
01:25:59.315 --> 01:26:01.302
And you get this.

1321
01:26:09.261 --> 01:26:11.713
Go get your coat.

1322
01:26:12.336 --> 01:26:13.981
Where are we going?

1323
01:26:14.006 --> 01:26:15.569
It's a surprise.

1324
01:26:19.789 --> 01:26:20.585
What's that?

1325
01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:21.445
What?

1326
01:26:21.827 --> 01:26:23.299
It's a present for you.

1327
01:26:24.439 --> 01:26:25.259
For me?

1328
01:26:25.294 --> 01:26:27.516
Yeah. Don't...
Don't open it.


1329
01:26:27.541 --> 01:26:30.491
It's a surprise.
We can open it later together.


1330
01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:34.809
You got me a present
on your birthday?


1331
01:26:37.411 --> 01:26:38.400
Oh!

1332
01:26:40.225 --> 01:26:41.292
Come here.

1333
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:45.356
I have fallen...

1334
01:26:45.381 --> 01:26:47.043
Did you hurt yourself?

1335
01:26:48.588 --> 01:26:50.598
I wasn't finished.

1336
01:26:51.496 --> 01:26:55.761
I have fallen so in love with you,

1337
01:26:56.587 --> 01:26:59.806
so much more than
I told you I would.

1338
01:27:05.314 --> 01:27:06.323
All right.

1339
01:27:08.519 --> 01:27:09.508
We're here.

1340
01:27:14.787 --> 01:27:15.751
Ok.

1341
01:27:24.642 --> 01:27:25.631
Come on.

1342
01:27:38.688 --> 01:27:39.609
Take it out!

1343
01:27:39.634 --> 01:27:41.349
Come on, take it out!

1344
01:28:05.702 --> 01:28:08.323
Clear it out!
Clear it out!


1345
01:28:08.348 --> 01:28:09.567
Clear it out!

1346
01:28:14.192 --> 01:28:15.590
Yeah!
Oh!


1347
01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:24.047
Oh!

1348
01:28:24.072 --> 01:28:25.461
Yeah!

1349
01:28:25.486 --> 01:28:26.422
Whoo!

1350
01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:28.313
Whoo!

1351
01:28:29.122 --> 01:28:30.048
Whoo!

1352
01:28:54.177 --> 01:28:56.993
He caught the puck!
I don't believe it!


1353
01:29:02.471 --> 01:29:03.256
Whoo!

1354
01:29:06.887 --> 01:29:07.727
Hey!

1355
01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:34.552
North stars!

1356
01:29:34.935 --> 01:29:36.280
North stars!

1357
01:29:36.462 --> 01:29:37.630
Yay!

1358
01:29:37.721 --> 01:29:38.771
Yay!

1359
01:29:41.319 --> 01:29:43.312
I can't believe
you caught a puck.


1360
01:29:43.337 --> 01:29:44.599
That's like...

1361
01:29:45.121 --> 01:29:46.767
It's like never happens.

1362
01:29:46.792 --> 01:29:48.620
That's like amazing.

1363
01:29:51.451 --> 01:29:52.624
You're amazing.

1364
01:29:56.855 --> 01:29:59.138
Thank you
for taking me, Caroline.


1365
01:29:59.973 --> 01:30:01.766
I didn't know if you'd like it.

1366
01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.179
You know what I like.

1367
01:30:07.603 --> 01:30:09.751
I'm glad you like it
as much as me.


1368
01:30:11.101 --> 01:30:12.412
I love hockey.

1369
01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.131
You didn't even know
what a power play was.


1370
01:30:20.653 --> 01:30:23.582
I know, but the next time we go,
you can tell me.


1371
01:30:23.607 --> 01:30:25.717
I'll catch another
one of these for you.


1372
01:30:31.766 --> 01:30:33.510
It's a good game, huh?

1373
01:30:35.109 --> 01:30:36.324
Yeah.

1374
01:30:36.806 --> 01:30:38.061
Good game.

1375
01:31:31.891 --> 01:31:32.703
Hey.

1376
01:31:34.103 --> 01:31:35.596
Baby...

1377
01:31:35.621 --> 01:31:36.881
wake up.

1378
01:31:37.718 --> 01:31:38.823
We're home.

1379
01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:40.785
Hey.

1380
01:31:41.749 --> 01:31:44.040
Wake up. Wake up.

1381
01:31:46.367 --> 01:31:47.773
Sweetie.

1382
01:31:48.681 --> 01:31:49.687
We're home.

1383
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:53.459
Hey!

1384
01:31:57.054 --> 01:31:58.180
Hey!

1385
01:32:40.708 --> 01:32:41.938
Oh!

1386
01:32:56.841 --> 01:32:59.089
"If I give away
all my possessions,


1387
01:32:59.114 --> 01:33:01.667
"if I hand over my body
so I may boast.


1388
01:33:01.692 --> 01:33:02.840
"And do not have love,

1389
01:33:02.865 --> 01:33:04.512
"I gain nothing.

1390
01:33:04.537 --> 01:33:06.881
"Love is patient, love is kind.

1391
01:33:06.906 --> 01:33:08.722
"Love is not envious or boastful.

1392
01:33:08.747 --> 01:33:10.568
"Or arrogant or rude.

1393
01:33:10.593 --> 01:33:13.073
"It does not insist
on its own way.


1394
01:33:13.098 --> 01:33:15.354
"It is not irritable
or resentful.


1395
01:33:15.379 --> 01:33:17.627
"It does not rejoice
for wrongdoing.


1396
01:33:17.652 --> 01:33:19.623
"It rejoices in the truth.

1397
01:33:19.648 --> 01:33:22.308
"It bears all pains,
believes all things,


1398
01:33:22.333 --> 01:33:23.640
"and hopes all things.

1399
01:33:23.665 --> 01:33:26.666
"endures all things.
Love never ends.


1400
01:33:27.386 --> 01:33:30.121
"Whereas for prophecies,
they will come to an end.


1401
01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:32.140
"As for tongues,
they will cease.


1402
01:33:32.165 --> 01:33:33.945
"As for knowledge,
it will come to an end,


1403
01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:35.599
"for we only know in part,

1404

to an end."


1407
01:33:54.744 --> 01:33:56.005
I love you.

1408
01:33:59.096 --> 01:34:00.319
You're family.

1409
01:34:01.422 --> 01:34:02.522
I know.

1410
01:34:04.518 --> 01:34:06.110
You're lucky I love you, too.

1411
01:34:10.067 --> 01:34:12.225
Luck has nothing to do with it.

1412
01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:13.426
Hmm.

1413
01:34:15.331 --> 01:34:17.629
He was like an angel, you know?

1414
01:34:19.295 --> 01:34:21.756
I never knew life
could be like that.


1415
01:34:23.655 --> 01:34:26.357
He was the one thing I followed
through with in my life.


1416
01:34:26.382 --> 01:34:29.119
The one thing
I didn't give up on.


1417
01:34:30.666 --> 01:34:33.032
I was good at loving him.

1418
01:36:35.638 --> 01:36:36.527
Oh.

1419
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:43.444
"Dear Caroline,

1420
01:36:43.469 --> 01:36:44.570
"I don't need these anymore

1421
01:36:44.595 --> 01:36:46.586
"because all my wishes
came true.


1422
01:36:46.998 --> 01:36:48.099
"I found you.

1423
01:36:48.829 --> 01:36:50.508
"So play them and think of me.

1424
01:36:50.541 --> 01:36:52.469
"I'll wish on Mars
and think of you.


1425
01:36:53.466 --> 01:36:55.457
"I carry your heart with me.

1426
01:36:56.408 --> 01:36:57.908
"I'm not finished.

1427
01:36:58.616 --> 01:37:01.050
I carry it in my heart."
