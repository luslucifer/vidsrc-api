1
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.010
Hey there, baby!

2
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.491
Come here, baby!

3
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.881
Hello?

4
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.167
Yes.

5
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.486
How are things?

6
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.721
What time?

7
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.811
Are you going to dress
like a slut again?


8
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.327
And whine if you
don't find a guy?


9
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.845
Hold on a second.

10
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.647
I'll call you back.
I've got work to do.


11
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.049
I'll swing by your place.

12
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.445
See you tonight.

13
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.764
- Your thighs touch.
-What?


14
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.445
Your thighs rub together.

15
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.086
Stop it!

16
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.128
It's your body shape.

17
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.084
Even if you weighed 30 kg,

18
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.047
your thighs would still touch,
like a baby's.


19
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.011
You're silly! Back off!

20
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.081
Why?

21
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.242
Babies are cute!

22
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.922
You coming?
I'm fed up. Let's go home.


23
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.531
Not just yet.

24
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.686
I can't take any more.

25
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.241
Are you staying?

26
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.971
Seriously?

27
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.241
<i>You'd stay for that?</i>

28
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.007
"That" can drive you home,
if you like.


29
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.601
Do you like him?

30
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.801
A little.

31
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.650
You're not picky.

32
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.489
You think all guys are lame.

33
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.130
He's got a lousy car.

34
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.965
What do you do in London?

35
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.721
I work in an agency.

36
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.289
I find flats for French people.

37
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.682
Do you make a good living?

38
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.767
A living.

39
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.847
How about you?

40
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.721
A living.

41
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.649
Do you mind
if I put on some music?


42
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.286
No.

43
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.931
Got anything happier?

44
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.170
Do you enjoy suffering?

45
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.240
Ever wonder what life's like
for these girls?


46
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.007
What?

47
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.241
Shut up!

48
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.330
I'm sorry, I...

49
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.251
Let's just have the music.

50
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.371
Excuse me.

51
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.401
Can you let me out?
I'd like to walk a bit.


52
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.566
Anything wrong?

53
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.886
Fine, I...

54
00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.725
I need some air.

55
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.765
I feel nauseous.

56
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.245
A walk will do me good.

57
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.765
Hello, beautiful!

58
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.767
What's new?

59
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.760
Nothing.

60
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.127
You look tired.

61
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.367
You think so?

62
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.686
Do you sleep well?

63
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.681
Very well.

64
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.601
Do you eat well?

65
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.766
Vegetables?

66
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.526
Lots of vegetables.

67
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.047
That's good.

68
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.445
You're prettier than ever.

69
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.281
Thanks.

70
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.044
I'd like to take off on holiday.

71
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.926
Where?

72
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.287
I don't know.

73
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.051
Not sure who with, either.

74
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.843
- Do you still see Marine?
-No.


75
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.567
Good.

76
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.725
I'm fed up with seeing...

77
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.325
girls of the trade.

78
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.244
Do you want to go with me?

79
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.207
Yes.

80
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.006
Why not?

81
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.965
Do it as a favor.

82
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.202
They're good customers.
They know you.


83
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.090
I trust you.

84
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.964
I know. But that's not it.

85
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.003
- I don't do that anymore.
-I know.


86
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.405
But it's a one-time-thing.

87
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.041
It's big money.

88
00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.285
I'll think it over.

89
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.681
Yes, please do.

90
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.130
Still wild about me, Pussy?

91
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.325
I'll give you
the papers Tuesday.


92
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.005
We're meeting then anyway.

93
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.281
Fine.

94
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.845
I'm counting on you, Virginie.

95
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.565
Stop looking at me.

96
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.891
I'll look if I want.

97
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.206
Get some rest.

98
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.365
Bye, Cook, honey!

99
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.209
You hate that I earn
so much, eh?


100
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.849
- Hey, ebony lady!
- Yo!


101
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.884
- How are you?
-Fine and you?


102
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.767
Got time for lunch?

103
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.531
My aunt didn't
show up this morning.


104
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.761
You should have phoned.

105
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.121
I was in the neighborhood.

106
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.641
Oh, OK...

107
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.650
I'll take a cigarette break.

108
00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.441
I'll be right back.

109
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.529
So, did you fuck the guy?

110
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.681
No...

111
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.281
I wouldn't mind if you had.
You can tell me.


112
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.647
Well, I didn't.

113
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.241
What's up?

114
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.323
You got a secret or what?

115
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.001
Have you ever met a guy

116
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.768
and felt totally bewildered?

117
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.041
Like you're about to die?
Like it's the end of your life?


118
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.086
No, forget it.

119
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.767
Thanks.

120
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.001
Why's he here?

121
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.371
He called.
I invited him.


122
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.046
Is he your new boyfriend?

123
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.961
Not at all.

124
00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.366
I just invited him.

125
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.368
I'm sorry about the other night.

126
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.481
It's no big deal.

127
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.370
I should never go out.

128
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.891
It's always an ordeal.

129
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.371
You don't have fun?

130
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.526
I don't know how to.

131
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.241
Me, either.

132
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.164
Talking with someone like you
is my idea of fun.


133
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.091
Like me?

134
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.840
What am I like?

135
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.644
No sad song?

136
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.327
I'm not going to put on
any song at all.


137
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.531
I'm better when I'm alone.

138
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.964
I think I'm toxic for others.

139
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.166
Why do you say that?

140
00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.481
No reason.

141
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.969
If you don't know how to
have fun, and you don't chat,


142
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.720
can you sing?

143
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.046
A little.

144
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.963
- What, here?
-Yes.


145
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.969
<i>Hey you,
tell me you love me.</i>


146
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.209
<i>Even if it's a lie</i>

147
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.608
<i>Even if we don't stand a chance</i>

148
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.963
<i>Life is so sad</i>

149
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.283
<i>Tell me you love me</i>

150
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.888
<i>Every day is the same</i>

151
00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.321
<i>I need some romance.</i>

152
00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.205
I didn't lie, she's lovely.

153
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.487
What do you think?

154
00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.005
The sweetest.

155
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.883
There! It's done.

156
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.881
I'm relieved.

157
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.247
Damn!

158
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.965
- This will do, right?
-Yes.


159
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.002
- What do you think?
-She's pretty.


160
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.526
But not very bright.

161
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.007
Sorry?

162
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.889
Do you know my sister?

163
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.281
Yes, a little.

164
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.647
I've been waiting for her.
I'm her sister.


165
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.046
Why are you here?

166
00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.201
What the fuck!

167
00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.080
What happened?

168
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.650
I'm fed up. He drives me mad.

169
00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.969
- Did you quarrel with Dad?
-As usual. You know him.


170
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.680
How did you get
the travel money?


171
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.205
I just did.

172
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.362
- How?
-Baby-sitting left and right.


173
00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.803
Malika, can you get me a job?

174
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.801
In your agency?

175
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.525
- The estate agency.
-No.


176
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.324
They always need help.

177
00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.761
- I can't.
-Your boss will hire me.


178
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.961
It won't work.

179
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.446
You're a school kid!

180
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.726
Let me live with you.

181
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.001
They won't let you.

182
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.283
Dad will never allow it.
You know that. You're no dummy.


183
00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.971
Can you do me big favor?

184
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.764
I have an important meeting.

185
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.929
Can you take
my sister to a film?


186
00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.291
Ask her.

187
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.204
Why were you on my doorstep?

188
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.768
Gramps wanted to drive,

189
00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.246
but he was drunk.

190
00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.930
He didn't have his license.

191
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.209
And at that time,
the cops were searching for him.


192
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.801
Talk about being in a fix!

193
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.963
So my grandmother hid

194
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.643
behind the door

195
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.249
to hide the keys to prevent
Gramps from taking them.


196
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.410
And they...

197
00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.691
They had a row,
and we had to separate them.


198
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.486
Malika picked up
the first thing she could


199
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.045
and threw it at him.

200
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.526
It knocked him out.

201
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.801
What a mess!

202
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.047
We died laughing!

203
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.885
Wait, I was scared.

204
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.210
When you're scared,
you're violent.


205
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.686
It's your turn to tell

206
00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.405
a childhood memory.

207
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.521
I don't have any.

208
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.050
I don't have any memories.

209
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.405
Anyway, it's time to go.

210
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.684
You give this to Mom.

211
00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.446
Study hard.

212
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.841
Sure.

213
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.885
When you're 18, you can come.

214
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.321
I'll wait for you.

215
00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.041
Anyway, I'll come see you.

216
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.487
Really?

217
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.766
I promise.

218
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.806
Off you go.

219
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.646
Be careful.

220
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.210
I'll miss you.

221
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.410
Let's try to have some fun.

222
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.885
We're lousy at having fun.

223
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.084
Un, deux, three!

224
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.125
Shit, I fell asleep.

225
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.450
I'll never go back to sleep.

226
00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.810
Do you want to come up?

227
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.007
Yes.

228
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.601
Come here, baby.

229
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.280
I don't have any alcohol.

230
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.291
How about hot chocolate?

231
00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.171
A bisou is...

232
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.723
friendly and on the cheek.

233
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.285
<i>And a baiser...</i>

234
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.330
is more for lovers,

235
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.762
on the mouth.

236
00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.881
<i>Bisou.</i>

237
00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.041
<i>Baiser.</i>

238
00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.486
In my line of work?

239
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.001
Are you a cop?

240
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.207
<i>So, you're a cop'?</i>

241
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.887
Get out.

242
00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.327
Whatever, get out.

243
00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.040
Get out, OK?

244
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.480
Do you get that?

245
00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.045
Do you get that?

246
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.810
Get out. Leave!

247
00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.246
How are you, sweetie?

248
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.283
Shut up.

249
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.320
Do you know him?

250
00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.165
Need your fix, darling?

251
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.971
Talk nicely to her...

252
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.281
darling.

253
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.966
I'll turn on the heat.
It can't hurt.


254
00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.121
How old are you?

255
00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.845
You'll be hungry afterwards.

256
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.971
Shit.

257
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.171
Stop it.

258
01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.487
Who are you?

259
01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.287
Who are you?

260
01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.121
You must be kidding!

261
01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.841
Right now?

262
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.568
Stop the car.
I'm going to throw up.


263
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.241
I'm screwed.

264
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.081
I'm screwed.

265
01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.842
<i>Sailing, sailing,
over the bounding sea...</i>


266
01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.446
<i>Over the bounding sea...</i>

267
01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.127
<i>Sailing...</i>

268
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:42.966
You all right?

269
01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.488
You'll drive me
to Electre's tomorrow.


270
01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.770
I'll pick up my dog.

271
01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.882
And I'll go see RaphaÃ©lle.

272
01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.126
Everything will be fine

273
01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.770
Do you want to start over

274
01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.927
like before?

275
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.961
Yes.

276
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.091
Exactly like before.

277
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.364
Before meeting you.

278
01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:03.967
Goodnight.

279
01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.566
I can't sleep.

280
01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.161
Don't stare!

281
01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.447
I'll do as I want.
You have no say about it.


282
01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.722
I can pull over and clobber you.

283
01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.607
You want me to?

284
01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.246
You want me to?

285
01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:17.486
Come on, move it!

286
01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.450
Don't drag your feet.

287
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.321
Come on.

288
01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.724
Admit it, you messed up.

289
01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.606
Get in there!

290
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.850
Go get me a coffee, please.

291
01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:05.246
Sit down.

292
01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.930
You look awful.

293
01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:13.562
I know.

294
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.126
Oh, you know?

295
01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.328
You know you got
me in trouble, too?


296
01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.851
The old man's better,
but you thrashed his son.


297
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.244
This is really bad.
Do you see?


298
01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.330
- Do you realize?
-Yes.


299
01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.681
I'm disappointed in you.

300
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.689
I never expected this from you.

301
01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.971
Do you realize?

302
01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.249
Do you realize this or not?

303
01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.366
Was it the girl?

304
01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.289
She couldn't bear the beatings.

305
01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.047
We ran away.
We walked and hitchhiked.


306
01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.006
We found a hotel.

307
01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.531
I fell asleep.
When I woke, she was gone.


308
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.926
She was traumatized.

309
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.730
She's pretty, but too young.

310
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.926
What can I say? Men want
younger and younger girls.


311
01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.366
That's not the issue.

312
01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.848
The thing is those
blokes in the manor,


313
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.809
especially the older one...

314
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.809
- And his son...
-Yes, I know.


315
01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.290
It won't happen again.

316
01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.050
You'll have to go
away on holiday.


317
01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.887
You can't work
looking like that.


318
01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.730
Where to?
Shall I arrange it?


319
01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.964
Go get some rest.

320
01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.050
My birthday party's tonight.

321
01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.247
Come tarted up!
Cook will pick you up.


322
01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.281
Come here.

323
01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.362
Come over here.

324
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.800
I was very scared.

325
01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.046
Come here.

326
01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.285
I'm not a child anymore.

327
01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.965
Wow, you look terrible.

328
01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.721
Plus, you're late.

329
01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.120
You all right?

330
01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.686
I'm all right.

331
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.201
My baby.

332
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.923
Is Rupert your boyfriend now?

333
01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.927
No.

334
01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.649
Oh, come on,
you can tell me.


335
01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.807
I said no.

336
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.570
You OK? You're being strange.

337
01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.127
I'm all right.

338
01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.201
I'll call you.

339
01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.841
Hold on. I know you.
I can see when things are wrong.


340
01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.210
No, you don't know me.

341
01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.281
What?

342
01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.281
You don't know me.

343
01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.922
I'm a whore.
Did you know that?


344
01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.724
He can't be my boyfriend.
I'm a whore.


345
01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.288
The hotel confirmed the info.

346
01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.764
The girls were with that bloke.

347
01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.329
I'll settle it with them
tonight. You handle him.


348
01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.169
- You OK?
-No.


349
01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.207
Later.

350
01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.404
Did you glam up for me?

351
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.566
Thanks.

352
01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.407
Don't look so sullen.
Have fun. Mingle.


353
01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.081
We'll talk about
the guy at the hotel.


354
01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.127
Have fun.

355
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.408
This is hardly a relaxing party.

356
01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.167
We're working.

357
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.251
I can multitask.
You can, too, right?


358
01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.327
Who was the guy?

359
01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.080
My boyfriend...

360
01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:11.964
He's not in this business.
I panicked and called him.


361
01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.924
You should have called me.

362
01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.291
I was scared.

363
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.242
You've got a boyfriend?

364
01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.848
Since when?
Is this recent?


365
01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.448
He's not really my boyfriend.
He's more like a friend.


366
01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.407
You've got no room
for a love life.


367
01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:46.966
I know.

368
01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.725
Especially a man like him.

369
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.331
He's not a friend.

370
01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.006
What makes you happy?

371
01:31:58.680 --> 01:31:59.761
Me?

372
01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.801
Everything.

373
01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.762
Everything I own.
Everything I've earned.


374
01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.169
A nice life,
the ease of things.


375
01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.329
I've had a rough life, you know.

376
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.484
Like you, I guess.

377
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.849
If you work and don't screw up,

378
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.808
you could have my job
in a few years.


379
01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:40.481
What do you think?

380
01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.845
What's that snide look?

381
01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:05.724
What's that snide look?

382
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.922
You're pissing me off.
What is this?


383
01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.211
Are you judging me?

384
01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.884
You think you're superior?

385
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.524
Or you're stronger maybe?

386
01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:24.364
Hey, Virginie,

387
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.604
you'd be crap without me.

388
01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:28.721
You know that?

389
01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:32.728
All the money you made is thanks
to me. You realize that?


390
01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.006
Hey, little whore,

391
01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.805
lower your gaze now.

392
01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.287
Lower your gaze!

393
01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.048
Do as I say! Lower your gaze!

394
01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:43.846
Lower your gaze now!

395
01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:45.724
Do you hear me?

396
01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:47.762
Lower your gaze!

397
01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.280
Clobber her!

398
01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.010
Catch her and clobber her!

399
01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.001
What are you doing?

400
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.206
I'm tired of running.

401
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.010
Virginie, help me!

402
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.001
Don't call me that.

403
01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:27.722
Your money is as filthy as mine.

404
01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.520
I'll miss you.

405
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.081
I know you.

406
01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:27.847
For sure.

407
01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.531
I'll miss you, too.

408
01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:32.647
For sure.

409
01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:37.088
- Take care of her.
-Promise.


410
01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.884
I'll come fetch her soon.

411
01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.807
<i>Final call for check-in.</i>

412
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.249
Aren't you tired
of rescuing whores?
