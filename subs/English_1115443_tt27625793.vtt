a part of that organization


463

464
00:23:34.717 --> 00:23:36.320
This is the application

465
00:23:36.387 --> 00:23:39.527
to the Traditionalist American
Knights of the KKK.


466
00:23:39.594 --> 00:23:41.298
And it simply asks,

"Do you support
white supremacism?"


468

They want people
that have skills.

00:23:48.678 --> 00:23:51.551
They want people
from the military.


470
00:23:51.618 --> 00:23:54.157
The KKK has a formal structure

471
00:23:54.223 --> 00:23:57.029

of the National Guard.</i>

00:24:20.275 --> 00:24:23.781
that impostors

00:24:23.849 --> 00:24:26.054
the meeting or the Klan.

480
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:30.129
They would use terms like
AYAK, are you a Klansman?


481
00:24:30.195 --> 00:24:32.166
And the proper response,
if you are a Klansman,


482
00:24:32.233 --> 00:24:35.907
is AKIA, A-K-I-A,
a Klansman, I am.


483
00:24:35.973 --> 00:24:38.178
If you don't respond
with AKIA,


484
00:24:38.245 --> 00:24:40.015
they know
you're not a Klansman.


485
00:24:40.082 --> 00:24:42.152
They also have a blood oath.

486
00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:45.091
- Yes, they do.
When you sign the blood oath,


487
00:24:45.158 --> 00:24:48.198
they tell you
that if you violate

you'll pay with your blood.
