What kind of shit is that?

Yeah, let's run it. Let's run it.

144
00:06:06.078 --> 00:06:09.457

Let somebody yell in your
motherfucking face like that.


165
00:06:59.507 --> 00:07:01.384
"Man, get the fuck out of my face."

166
00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:02.635
[crowd laughs]

167
00:07:02.718 --> 00:07:05.471
[speaking gibberish]

168
00:07:05.972 --> 00:07:07.807
I'm like,
"Nigga, I'm out of here, I quit."


169
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.227
"I don't want to do this.
Get the fuck out of my face."


170
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.186
[crowd laughs]

171
00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:17.900
I tried to go to the military, man.

172
00:07:17.984 --> 00:07:19.277
[crowd laughs]

173
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.279
They call it a ASVAB.

174
00:07:21.362 --> 00:07:22.405
[crowd titters]

175
00:07:22.488 --> 00:07:25.116
Man, that recruiter picked me up
and took me out to dinner.


176
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.244
I went to Ponderosa,
had that big potato with that steak.


177
00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:30.121
[crowd howls, laughs]

178
00:07:30.204 --> 00:07:31.205
What?

179
00:07:32.373 --> 00:07:35.126
Man, I took the test
and flunked the test, man.


180
00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:36.210
[crowd titters]

181
00:07:36.294 --> 00:07:39.755
I couldn't get his ass back on that phone.
I knew something wasn't right.


182
00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:40.881
[crowd laughs]

183
00:07:40.965 --> 00:07:44.969
But I'd already lied and told everybody
I was going to the military. Like, "Look."


184
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.014
"I got the brochures."
I had some brochures.


185
00:07:48.097 --> 00:07:48.973
[crowd laughs]

186
00:07:49.056 --> 00:07:51.267
"I leave, I think, next Wednesday?"

187
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.935
[crowd roars]

188
00:07:53.019 --> 00:07:56.814
[crowd laughs, chuckles]

189
00:07:57.607 --> 00:08:01.819
Man, that recruiter called me
and told me I wasn't going.


190
00:08:01.902 --> 00:08:03.904
[crowd cackles]

191
00:08:03.988 --> 00:08:06.782
My other two friends, they went.
I was sad as hell.


192
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.952
They was like,
"Mike, man. We love you, bro."


193
00:08:10.036 --> 00:08:11.037
[crowd titters]

194
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.372
I said, "Damn, man." I was sad.

195
00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:16.417
I told everybody I was leaving.
I said, "I gotta get out of here."


196
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.752
"I got to do something."

197
00:08:18.377 --> 00:08:20.379
So I went to prison. 
I said I'm gonna...

198
00:08:20.463 --> 00:08:21.505
[crowd roars]

199
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:25.301
I'm gonna disappear
for a couple years and come back.


200
00:08:25.384 --> 00:08:29.013
[crowd laughs]

201
00:08:29.096 --> 00:08:30.973
[crowd titters]

202
00:08:31.057 --> 00:08:34.143
'Cause guys who go to prison,
they're not fair to young guys.


203
00:08:34.226 --> 00:08:37.772
'Cause they make the young kids
want to go see what's in there.


204
00:08:37.855 --> 00:08:40.441
'Cause they be bragging on it.
It sounds so good.


205
00:08:40.524 --> 00:08:44.695
They'll be like, "Yeah, and then I did
two years up there in Sing Sing."


206
00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:47.907
"You know what I mean? Then I did
another five, know what I mean?"


207
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.618
"That's when I went
and got swoled up, up there."


208
00:08:50.701 --> 00:08:51.661
[crowd cackles]

209
00:08:51.744 --> 00:08:53.537
The kids are like, "I wanna go."

210
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:55.373
[crowd laughs]

211
00:08:57.458 --> 00:09:01.671
Yeah, you're not telling these young guys,
"You might get fucked in there."


212
00:09:01.754 --> 00:09:04.507
[crowd laughs]

[crowd titters]

214
00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:12.556
And on the street, you know, in the hood,
they call them ops, you know?


215
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.059
That's your ops.
I'm like, "What the fuck is that?"


216
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.436
Yeah. Your opposition.

217
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.482
I'm like, "Okay. I don't know.
Yeah, OG, that's an op right there."


218
00:09:21.565 --> 00:09:24.777
"Yeah, there go my op, watch out."
I'm like, "What's an op?"


219
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.987
"Is that a cop
without the C on it?"

220
00:09:27.071 --> 00:09:29.156
[crowd laughs]

221
00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:31.784
They got little dudes,
they call them hitters.


222
00:09:31.867 --> 00:09:34.620
These are the little dudes
that are shooting motherfuckers.


223
00:09:35.246 --> 00:09:37.498
Shooters. There goes the little shooter.

224
00:09:37.581 --> 00:09:40.459
They be describing this motherfucking dude
shooting everybody.

00:09:40.543 --> 00:09:42.169
He'd be the size of that pole.

[crowd laughs]

227
00:09:43.587 --> 00:09:45.589

[crowd cackles]

236
00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:08.529
Then they go to prison
and can't defend they self.


237
00:10:08.612 --> 00:10:09.572
[man] That's right!

But some big convict that been lifting

You can call me a fake-ass nigga

[crowd laughs]

265
00:11:20.392 --> 00:11:24.146
Black people

[crowd cackles]

[crowd laughs]

269
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:38.994
There was Black people saying,

Shit.

274
00:11:50.673 --> 00:11:53.801
Black people need two voices
in this fucking world.


275
00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:56.679
Yeah, you need two voices.

So you got to have a white voice.
White people don't need two voices.


281
00:12:12.444 --> 00:12:14.780
They don't need a Black voice for shit.

Your mama on the phone

[crowd murmurs]

300
00:13:04.538 --> 00:13:07.124
Yeah. Some areas that
I can trust white people in.


301
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.336
I don't trust white people with God. No.

[crowd titters]

303
00:13:11.587 --> 00:13:14.256
I won't let them

[crowd cackles]

00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:28.270
"See, the Lord understands you, Michael."

693
00:29:40.867 --> 00:29:45.163

You know what I mean?

You know why? 'Cause I didn't
want to be that guy up in prison.

[crowd laughs, titters]

750

You tell the lady at the therapist,
"Don't you tell nobody this shit."

[crowd laughs]

772
00:33:00.566 --> 00:33:03.069
She's like,
"No, this stays between me and you."


773
00:33:03.653 --> 00:33:07.240
You think she's going to ride
in the hood, say, "Hey, guys, what's up?"


774
00:33:07.323 --> 00:33:10.284

That's what you be scared of.

783
00:33:30.346 --> 00:33:33.599
My therapist straight up
asked me one time, man.

00:33:33.683 --> 00:33:36.227

[laughter continues]

791

[crowd titters]

That's why you got to pop up

965
00:41:29.617 --> 00:41:30.492
Uh-huh.

966
00:41:30.576 --> 00:41:32.661
"You didn't know
I was coming today, did you?"

She coming home happy, she's supposed

'Cause men, we can't take
what women can take. You know?

I mean, it'd be the end of our world,
you know?


1005
00:43:02.584 --> 00:43:06.046
If you catch a woman doing fucked-up shit
she ain't supposed to be doing,


1006
00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.382

That's what I said when I seen it.

1122
00:47:50.455 --> 00:47:52.624
I said, "If you let

You know the police

1138
00:48:30.203 --> 00:48:31.663
I don't care how old you is.

1139
00:48:32.205 --> 00:48:34.624
I was in jail one time
and see my buddy's grandmother.


1140
00:48:34.708 --> 00:48:37.544
She's about 75. You know how

1141
00:48:37.627 --> 00:48:40.881
I've seen her being like this.
I said, "Hey, Miss Therese."

You know how they do
that gun turn-in thing?


1159
00:49:23.548 --> 00:49:27.344
Like, they say, "Come on down,
bring in your gun. Stop the violence."


1160
00:49:28.095 --> 00:49:30.847
Man, I went down there one time, man.

One of my buddies, man...
Rest in peace, man.


1169
00:49:56.915 --> 00:49:58.667
He was in prison, man,

the value of some penis, I'm telling you.


1196
00:51:15.785 --> 00:51:17.621
You see a penis on

you'll see cars
just constantly keep hitting it.
