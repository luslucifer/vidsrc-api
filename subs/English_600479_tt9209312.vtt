00:01:06.852 --> 00:01:09.146
<i>The Surprisers</i>

2
00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:11.269
<i>are those whose imagination</i>

3
00:01:11.852 --> 00:01:16.228
<i>is so powerful
that they can change the world,</i>


4
00:01:17.353 --> 00:01:19.270
<i>at least their own,</i>

5
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.688
<i>which is an excellent start.</i>

6
00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:45.405
A MERMAID IN PARIS

7
00:02:49.113 --> 00:02:51.114
Just for you at the Flowerburger Boat,

8
00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:56.030
a snowflake-man who never melts,
even for Parisian beauties!


9
00:02:59.155 --> 00:03:02.115
Gaspard Snow and the Barberettes!

10
00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:08.949
<i>Love to death
I've been there before</i>


11
00:03:10.282 --> 00:03:12.949
<i>Never again will I turn back the oars</i>

12
00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:14.491
<i>To the land</i>

13
00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:16.700
<i>Where fairies</i>

14
00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:20.700
<i>On barbed-wire wings soar...</i>

15
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.118
The ghosts of my memories
are leaning on the bar.


16
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.492
Certainly, sir. 
Right this way.

17
00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:37.535
<i>Love to death</i>

18
00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:39.952
<i>I've been there before</i>

19
00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:45.160
<i>Barbed-wire girl, my heart was yours</i>

20
00:03:46.202 --> 00:03:49.578
<i>Your transformation closed that door...</i>

21
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.620
-Hey, Henri.
-Richard.


22
00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:54.495
Good to see you.

23
00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.621
<i>Your memory's with me forevermore</i>

24
00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:05.162
<i>Stuck to my heart
It's got a strong hold</i>


25
00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:08.955
<i>Like a piece of bubblegum</i>

26
00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:01.794
I love you!

27
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:25.511
My piggy bank when I was 4.

28
00:06:25.595 --> 00:06:28.762
Exactly, except that you're 40.

29
00:06:30.053 --> 00:06:33.220
It was a little porcelain chick.
I loved that chick.


30
00:06:33.304 --> 00:06:34.971
I still have it, in fact.

31
00:06:36.345 --> 00:06:39.346
The attic-man who couldn't part
with things.


32
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.138
Except girls!

33
00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.473
I got an offer this morning.

34
00:06:50.055 --> 00:06:51.347
An offer?

35
00:06:52.723 --> 00:06:55.473
A restaurant chain.
They're willing to buy now.


36
00:06:56.514 --> 00:06:58.015
We've had this talk, Dad.

37
00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:03.223
There are too many ghosts here.

38
00:07:03.307 --> 00:07:05.640
-Memories, you mean.
-Memories, ghosts.


39
00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:07.391
It's all the same.

40
00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:09.558
You can't keep everything forever.

41
00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:11.266
The Barberettes,

42
00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:13.558
the florist for the burgers

43
00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:17.225
and the voice-o-graph... We can't.

44
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:18.225
Why not?

45
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:21.018
-Nobody uses it anymore.
-I do!


46
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.101
Take it home, then.
I'll help you carry it up.


47
00:07:24.185 --> 00:07:25.351
Its place is here.

48
00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:28.477
It was created on board,
it stays on board.


49
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.769
You look like a zombie. Go home.

50
00:07:34.394 --> 00:07:36.394
It pains me to see you like this.

51
00:07:37.436 --> 00:07:39.770
What kind of a
zombie goes home to bed?

52
00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:49.604
The roller-skating zombie is a rarity
and it needs as much sleep as humans.


53
00:09:02.487 --> 00:09:03.946
Evening, Mr. Gaspard!

54
00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:06.987
Rossy, you scared me.

55
00:09:07.737 --> 00:09:09.154
I'm sorry.

56
00:09:09.237 --> 00:09:11.696
That's not very nice. Me, scary?

57
00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:13.363
That's not what I meant.

58
00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:15.821
Was the fishing any good?

59
00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:17.655
No.

60
00:09:19.572 --> 00:09:20.405
Here.

61
00:09:23.989 --> 00:09:26.365
Not every time I come home alone.

62
00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:30.114
It's a preventive measure.

63
00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:33.323
I don't want you
to end up all alone like me.


64
00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:37.032
-Night, Rossy.
-Good night, Mr. Gaspard.


65
00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:39.157
Sleep well!

66
00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:42.532
BEWARE OF CAT

67
00:09:50.075 --> 00:09:51.325
Johnny boy.

68
00:09:53.076 --> 00:09:54.493
My little Johnny Cash.

69
00:12:48.928 --> 00:12:50.220
What do you think?

70
00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:51.928
Charming.

71
00:12:56.178 --> 00:12:57.846
-Mr. Snow?
-Yes.


72
00:12:58.345 --> 00:12:59.679
Your voice-o-graph.

73
00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:13.681
Why did you do it?

74
00:13:15.848 --> 00:13:18.764
Your grandma and mother are gone.
We have to cope.


75
00:13:19.348 --> 00:13:22.181
They'd have fought
to keep the Flowerburger!


76
00:13:22.765 --> 00:13:26.348
Do you seriously think I don't care?

77
00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:29.391
I have more memories here than you do!

78
00:13:29.474 --> 00:13:30.932
Now get out!

79
00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.187
Miss!

80
00:14:23.188 --> 00:14:24.188
Shit.

81
00:14:25.188 --> 00:14:26.313
What is this?

82
00:14:42.356 --> 00:14:43.399
Sorry.

83
00:15:03.401 --> 00:15:04.443
Sir!

84
00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:12.360
Sir!

85
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:18.527
I found someone on the docks.
She's unconscious.


86
00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:20.361
Can you take us to the hospital?

87
00:15:20.444 --> 00:15:21.569
Please!

88
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.154
Wait, wait!

89
00:15:31.112 --> 00:15:33.237
Excuse me,
I need to take her to the hospital.


90
00:15:51.197 --> 00:15:53.281
-Were you looking for me?
-Yes!


91
00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:56.781
-You're handsome.
-You're beautiful.


92
00:15:56.865 --> 00:15:58.615
No, I don't feel well.

93
00:15:58.698 --> 00:16:00.990
-What's going on?
-I don't know.


94
00:16:01.073 --> 00:16:02.699
Since this morning I feel

95
00:16:02.782 --> 00:16:03.991
nauseous.

96
00:16:04.074 --> 00:16:05.240
Nauseous?

97
00:16:05.324 --> 00:16:07.033
Yes, that's right.

98
00:16:07.116 --> 00:16:08.866
-Seriously?
-Seriously.


99
00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:12.283
-Is something of mine in there?
-I didn't say that.


100
00:16:12.366 --> 00:16:14.408
It may be the
cheesecake I had for lunch.

101
00:16:14.491 --> 00:16:17.658
No. This is not a cheesecake.

102
00:16:19.284 --> 00:16:20.743
We'll do a test tonight?

103
00:16:35.535 --> 00:16:36.411
Cut it out.

104
00:16:38.036 --> 00:16:39.036
Cut it out!

105
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.828
<i>Doctor, there's a bad case of delirium.</i>

106
00:16:47.912 --> 00:16:49.704
<i>
-Can you come?</i>
-Be right there.

107
00:16:49.787 --> 00:16:50.913
Back I go.

108
00:16:50.996 --> 00:16:52.079
Should I stay or not?

109
00:16:52.163 --> 00:16:54.996
Wait, I won't be long.
We'll go home together.


110
00:17:00.413 --> 00:17:01.788
I'm so happy.

111
00:17:16.497 --> 00:17:17.332
Stay put.

112
00:17:17.415 --> 00:17:19.373
Hang in there. 
I'll be quick!

113
00:17:37.459 --> 00:17:38.959
Hello, it's an emergency.

114
00:17:39.043 --> 00:17:41.542
There's someone unconscious in my <i>tuk-tuk.</i>

115
00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:42.959
I mean, in my car.

116
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:44.918
How long has it been?

117
00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:46.543
Has what been?

118
00:17:46.627 --> 00:17:49.127
How long has this person been unconscious?

119
00:17:49.211 --> 00:17:51.252
No idea, I found her on the docks.

120
00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:53.002
Her health insurance card.

121
00:17:53.085 --> 00:17:54.127
What?

122
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:56.169
Her health insurance card, do you have it?

123
00:17:56.252 --> 00:17:58.003
No, but I can give you mine.

124
00:18:03.754 --> 00:18:05.962
Can you give me her date of birth?

125
00:18:06.046 --> 00:18:08.879
No, but her date
of death might be today!

126
00:18:09.463 --> 00:18:13.129
Sorry, but without a card,
I can't help you.


127
00:18:13.213 --> 00:18:16.088
I have a card
and I've been waiting for 4 hours!


128
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.464
You're not outta the woods yet, pal!

129
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.924
Miss, can you hear me?

130
00:18:35.132 --> 00:18:36.257
Miss?

131
00:18:50.842 --> 00:18:52.759
Miss, can you hear me?

132
00:19:31.638 --> 00:19:33.930
Leaving me all his crap...

133
00:20:11.226 --> 00:20:12.351
You OK back there?

134
00:20:44.646 --> 00:20:46.979
Sir, this is a no-smoking area.

135
00:20:50.854 --> 00:20:52.355
I don't feel well.

136
00:20:54.188 --> 00:20:56.231
Did you have cheesecake, too?

137
00:20:57.189 --> 00:21:00.272
I saw a mermaid

138
00:21:00.356 --> 00:21:01.856
out front.

139
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.273
That's crazy because I just saw a unicorn
in the hallway.


140
00:21:06.357 --> 00:21:09.774
It was galloping. 
It almost impaled me!

141
00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.649
You didn't sing Yves Montand, did you?

142
00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:25.442
You OK?

143
00:21:26.067 --> 00:21:27.067
Victor?

144
00:21:56.654 --> 00:21:57.862
Damn.

145
00:22:13.155 --> 00:22:14.905
Easy, kitty.

146
00:22:49.617 --> 00:22:50.909
You like this one?

147
00:23:35.873 --> 00:23:37.373
Temperature OK?

148
00:23:49.291 --> 00:23:50.291
Me Gaspard.

149
00:23:50.374 --> 00:23:52.000
Snow.

150
00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:58.000
Yum-yum?

151
00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:00.042
Eat?

152
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.588
It's me. Where you at?
The first customers are here.


153
00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:36.796
I can't come tonight, Dad.

154
00:24:38.046 --> 00:24:39.713
You're still mad at me.

155
00:24:47.089 --> 00:24:49.464
Is she the one I hear singing?

156
00:24:51.298 --> 00:24:53.465
No, it's the cat.

157
00:24:53.548 --> 00:24:55.173
<i>Right, I believe you.</i>

158
00:25:07.299 --> 00:25:11.550
Come on, bring your opera singer.
It's the miraculous catch here.


159
00:25:11.633 --> 00:25:15.258
<i>The flood's a crowd-puller.
Time to save the Flowerburger!</i>


160
00:25:22.718 --> 00:25:24.342
<i>We really need you here.</i>

161
00:25:24.426 --> 00:25:25.968
I can't, Dad.

162
00:25:26.051 --> 00:25:27.177
Love you.

163
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.097
Does it hurt?

164
00:26:10.723 --> 00:26:13.015
Give me a minute, 
I'll fix that.

165
00:26:16.557 --> 00:26:17.390
When I was young...

166
00:26:18.682 --> 00:26:20.265
I wanted to be a vet.

167
00:26:20.682 --> 00:26:24.391
I only nursed hamsters,
but I'm good with animals.


168
00:26:28.641 --> 00:26:30.308
I don't mean you.

169
00:26:32.892 --> 00:26:35.100
No, keep still!

170
00:26:52.436 --> 00:26:53.894
Watch out...

171
00:26:58.895 --> 00:27:00.103
It hurts a little.

172
00:27:07.687 --> 00:27:09.313
If you don't move too much,

173
00:27:10.271 --> 00:27:11.563
it should stick.

174
00:27:12.396 --> 00:27:13.647
There.

175
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.813
Don't move too much.

176
00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:21.897
Lula.

177
00:27:25.814 --> 00:27:26.814
Sorry?

178
00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:32.690
My name.

179
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:34.732
Lula.

180
00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:40.274
You can speak?

181
00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:42.608
Less than you, but yes...

182
00:27:44.983 --> 00:27:46.441
Are you alright?

183
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.859
You need to eat.

184
00:27:53.108 --> 00:27:54.567
I made you something.

185
00:28:03.109 --> 00:28:05.069
You'll see. It's frozen but...

186
00:28:05.152 --> 00:28:06.027
French brand.

187
00:28:47.906 --> 00:28:50.198
But I'm all out.

188
00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:03.908
So?

189
00:29:24.494 --> 00:29:26.452
I'd like to go home now.

190
00:29:28.911 --> 00:29:31.827
Maybe you should heal first.

191
00:29:31.911 --> 00:29:35.119
If I'm not back in the water
in two sunrises,


192
00:29:35.954 --> 00:29:37.203
I'll die.

193
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.787
That leaves time for a good night's sleep.

194
00:29:45.329 --> 00:29:47.329
It's best to take me now,

195
00:29:47.412 --> 00:29:49.413
in case you die during the night.

196
00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:52.080
Do I look that old?

197
00:29:56.956 --> 00:29:59.914
Keep still and don't soak your bandage.

198
00:29:59.997 --> 00:30:02.665
I'll take that.
If you need anything, holler.


199
00:30:03.832 --> 00:30:05.915
Tomorrow, I'll take you back
before going to work.


200
00:30:05.998 --> 00:30:06.915
Sound good?

201
00:30:09.457 --> 00:30:10.666
Lights on?

202
00:30:12.123 --> 00:30:13.123
Lights?

203
00:30:14.749 --> 00:30:15.999
Light on.

204
00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:18.041
Or off?

205
00:30:21.917 --> 00:30:23.042
Off.

206
00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:31.835
Good night.

207
00:30:42.627 --> 00:30:43.794
That voice...

208
00:30:44.877 --> 00:30:47.670
I'd never heard such a voice.

209
00:32:07.011 --> 00:32:08.053
Sorry.

210
00:33:06.934 --> 00:33:09.685
You noticed nothing,
no particular symptoms?


211
00:33:09.768 --> 00:33:10.768
No.

212
00:33:11.977 --> 00:33:13.310
He was delirious.

213
00:33:14.727 --> 00:33:18.311
At first, I thought it was a game.
He loves messing with me.


214
00:33:19.769 --> 00:33:21.936
But he wasn't, he was like...

215
00:33:22.519 --> 00:33:23.936
hypnotized.

216
00:33:24.728 --> 00:33:27.478
He had abnormally high nitrogen levels.

217
00:33:27.562 --> 00:33:29.812
Like an inert gas narcosis.

218
00:33:29.895 --> 00:33:31.520
The rapture of the deep...

219
00:33:34.438 --> 00:33:36.937
You should go home and get some rest.

220
00:33:39.104 --> 00:33:41.272
I'll keep you informed.

221
00:33:59.149 --> 00:34:02.940
<i>Love to death
He's been there before...</i>


222
00:34:31.942 --> 00:34:33.068
Sorry, I woke you.

223
00:34:33.569 --> 00:34:34.569
Feeling better?

224
00:34:35.276 --> 00:34:36.153
And you?

225
00:34:36.652 --> 00:34:37.652
What do you mean?

226
00:34:38.153 --> 00:34:40.153
Does your heart hurt?

227
00:34:40.736 --> 00:34:42.777
Me? Not at all.

228
00:34:46.236 --> 00:34:48.737
Do you often sing like that?

229
00:34:52.029 --> 00:34:53.653
Sometimes, why?

230
00:34:53.738 --> 00:34:55.196
Are you a sailor?

231
00:34:56.988 --> 00:35:00.071
No, I'm just... a shower crooner.

232
00:36:29.706 --> 00:36:30.873
A mongoose!

233
00:36:32.624 --> 00:36:33.624
There!

234
00:36:34.207 --> 00:36:35.999
It's not a mongoose, it's Johnny Cash.

235
00:36:38.749 --> 00:36:40.082
He loves country music.

236
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:42.999
He's very sweet.

237
00:36:47.167 --> 00:36:50.708
Usually, men who hear my voice fall
so madly in love with me


238
00:36:50.792 --> 00:36:52.375
that their hearts explode.

239
00:36:53.918 --> 00:36:55.167
Sorry.

240
00:36:56.417 --> 00:36:58.043
You shouldn't laugh.

241
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:01.376
You're going to die

242
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.418
like all the others.

243
00:37:03.502 --> 00:37:05.168
-All of them?
-All of them.


244
00:37:07.794 --> 00:37:10.085
My heart exploded long ago.

245
00:37:11.711 --> 00:37:12.711
It exploded?

246
00:37:12.795 --> 00:37:14.294
Yeah, several times.

247
00:37:14.878 --> 00:37:16.419
I can't feel a thing anymore.

248
00:37:17.795 --> 00:37:18.836
Love is over for me.

249
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.921
Gaspard...

250
00:37:22.796 --> 00:37:23.837
Yes?

251
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:26.962
Your heart's going to explode

252
00:37:27.463 --> 00:37:29.213
and this time for good.

253
00:37:32.005 --> 00:37:33.213
Shall I change the water?

254
00:37:35.797 --> 00:37:37.214
Take me back now.

255
00:37:38.838 --> 00:37:40.089
In this state?

256
00:37:41.506 --> 00:37:43.422
I'm immune, I tell you.

257
00:37:47.006 --> 00:37:48.507
I'll take good care of you.

258
00:37:49.632 --> 00:37:52.840
Once you're back on your feet,
so to speak,


259
00:37:54.799 --> 00:37:56.007
I'll take you back.

260
00:37:59.299 --> 00:38:00.758
May I?

261
00:38:03.591 --> 00:38:04.633
Excuse me?

262
00:38:05.633 --> 00:38:06.634
With whom?

263
00:38:07.217 --> 00:38:10.133
The number, in the top left corner.

264
00:38:12.801 --> 00:38:13.801
Excuse me?

265
00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:15.468
Yes?

266
00:38:15.551 --> 00:38:17.343
Anything unusual happen yesterday?

267
00:38:17.426 --> 00:38:19.635
You mean like every day?

268
00:38:21.385 --> 00:38:24.344
When you saw Victor, was he with anyone?

269
00:38:25.927 --> 00:38:27.511
No one.

270
00:38:27.594 --> 00:38:30.469
Just before,
there was an edgy guy with no shoes.


271
00:38:30.552 --> 00:38:32.803
He forgot this, if it can help.

272
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:39.553
No, I'm asking for the number
in the top left corner.


273
00:38:46.763 --> 00:38:48.138
You're gonna love this.

274
00:38:49.513 --> 00:38:50.888
Trust me. Be right back.

275
00:38:55.806 --> 00:38:58.098
It's a portable movie theater,
just for you.


276
00:39:06.348 --> 00:39:07.640
Got it.

277
00:39:12.766 --> 00:39:13.808
Be right back.

278
00:39:29.267 --> 00:39:30.101
See anything?

279
00:39:30.809 --> 00:39:31.892
Is it working?

280
00:39:39.435 --> 00:39:42.018
Look at this. She's like you.

281
00:39:47.061 --> 00:39:48.395
I'm gonna head out.

282
00:39:48.478 --> 00:39:49.645
Gotta get going.

283
00:39:51.228 --> 00:39:52.895
If you sing, make it "Piano, Piano."

284
00:39:52.979 --> 00:39:56.020
I wouldn't want a heartbroken neighbor
dead on my doorstep.


285
00:39:56.645 --> 00:39:58.187
"Piano, Piano"?

286
00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:05.021
Or "Hush, Hush."

287
00:40:10.772 --> 00:40:11.689
Exactly.

288
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.772
OK, enjoy the movie!

289
00:40:32.983 --> 00:40:33.983
Shit!

290
00:40:39.233 --> 00:40:41.400
-Good morning, Mr. Gaspard!
-Rossy.


291
00:40:41.984 --> 00:40:43.817
-How's everything?
-All good.


292
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.401
-Congratulations!
-For what?


293
00:40:46.484 --> 00:40:47.484
What?

294
00:40:47.567 --> 00:40:52.110
I saw you come home
with a hottie dressed as a fish.


295
00:40:52.193 --> 00:40:54.652
-She's just a friend.
-Just a friend...


296
00:40:54.734 --> 00:40:56.402
I hope she's not a singer!

297
00:40:56.485 --> 00:40:59.277
-No more singers!
-All right, Rossy.


298
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.819
-Congratulations!
-Thanks! Bye!


299
00:41:03.777 --> 00:41:06.778
What's the rush? 
He's gonna fall.

300
00:41:47.657 --> 00:41:51.825
Excuse me. Did you find
a sort of seaman's book last night?


301
00:41:52.366 --> 00:41:53.825
Health insurance card.

302
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.458
Where did you hear that?

303
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:08.166
It's been stuck in my head
since yesterday.


304
00:43:17.959 --> 00:43:19.959
You're not telling me something.

305
00:43:21.126 --> 00:43:22.584
You can talk to me.

306
00:43:23.209 --> 00:43:27.376
What if something extraordinary happened
and you couldn't tell anyone?


307
00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.918
I'd tell my best friend.

308
00:43:31.543 --> 00:43:33.210
That's what friends are for.

309
00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.960
But...

310
00:43:35.586 --> 00:43:37.335
is that extraordinarily good

311
00:43:37.961 --> 00:43:38.878
or bad?

312
00:43:38.961 --> 00:43:40.752
Simply extraordinary.

313
00:43:48.837 --> 00:43:49.962
Hello!

314
00:43:53.588 --> 00:43:56.713
I'm Rossy, Gaspard's next-door neighbor.

315
00:43:56.796 --> 00:43:57.796
Right there.

316
00:43:58.838 --> 00:44:01.464
Taking a bath fully dressed. Interesting.

317
00:44:02.005 --> 00:44:05.630
What a beautiful mermaid outfit you have.
Very well done.


318
00:44:09.131 --> 00:44:11.631
You're Gaspard's new girlfriend?

319
00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.590
You're a singer?

320
00:44:18.132 --> 00:44:20.257
A mysterious singer.

321
00:44:20.965 --> 00:44:23.008
I hope it'll turn out well.

322
00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.424
Gaspard is obsessed with singers.

323
00:44:26.507 --> 00:44:28.133
The last one nearly killed him.

324
00:44:28.216 --> 00:44:29.841
I tried to kill him, too.

325
00:44:31.925 --> 00:44:32.759
Really?

326
00:44:32.842 --> 00:44:34.800
-You're funny!
-You think so?


327
00:44:34.884 --> 00:44:35.967
Totally.

328
00:44:37.842 --> 00:44:41.176
You met at the Flowerburger, right?

329
00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.552
The Flowerburger is a fabulous place
to fall in love.


330
00:45:02.845 --> 00:45:03.928
"Twilight.

331
00:45:05.137 --> 00:45:09.054
Very light bites you eat
when day becomes night."


332
00:45:11.013 --> 00:45:13.263
<i>In order to understand Gaspard,</i>

333
00:45:13.347 --> 00:45:17.013
<i>you must know the story
of the Flowerburger.</i>


334
00:45:29.389 --> 00:45:33.474
<i>His grandmother, Sylvia Snow,
founded it in the early '40s.</i>


335
00:45:33.557 --> 00:45:35.766
<i>A pint-size gem of a woman</i>

336
00:45:35.848 --> 00:45:37.974
<i>with too big a heart.</i>

337
00:45:38.058 --> 00:45:40.474
<i>Welcome to the Flowerburger...</i>

338
00:45:40.557 --> 00:45:45.266
<i>Captain, poet, poker player, magician.</i>

339
00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.059
<i>The ghosts of my memories</i>

340
00:45:48.142 --> 00:45:50.309
<i>Are leaning on the bar</i>

341
00:45:50.391 --> 00:45:53.975
<i>At first, she used the barge
to hide resistant fighters.</i>


342
00:45:54.059 --> 00:45:57.267
<i>And for them,
she invented the voice-o-graph.</i>


343
00:45:57.851 --> 00:46:00.643
<i>To help them send coded messages.</i>

344
00:46:04.185 --> 00:46:08.144
<i>She also used it
to record declarations of love,</i>


345
00:46:09.144 --> 00:46:10.727
<i>poems</i>

346
00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:11.894
<i>and songs.</i>

347
00:46:11.977 --> 00:46:15.227
<i>I spend most of my life</i>

348
00:46:16.062 --> 00:46:19.103
<i>Living it to the full</i>

349
00:46:20.228 --> 00:46:23.145
<i>My nostalgia is rife</i>

350
00:46:23.228 --> 00:46:25.228
<i>With the future</i>

351
00:46:25.312 --> 00:46:28.771
<i>No time for a walk-through</i>

352
00:46:28.854 --> 00:46:31.854
<i>It'd take splitting in two</i>

353
00:46:32.688 --> 00:46:36.189
<i>It'd take slowing down</i>

354
00:46:36.939 --> 00:46:41.189
<i>Fast-tracking, it'd take</i>

355
00:46:41.272 --> 00:46:43.439
<i>Dreaming with you</i>

356
00:46:43.522 --> 00:46:45.940
<i>At the Flowerburger</i>

357
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.608
<i>The Flowerburger was a Noah's ark</i>

358
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:05.858
<i>for those who had a lust for life,</i>

359
00:47:06.525 --> 00:47:11.359
<i>who wanted to chat, to be saved,
to enjoy it all in one place and time!</i>


360
00:47:12.859 --> 00:47:14.651
<i>Everyone was in a state of...</i>

361
00:47:17.193 --> 00:47:18.693
No, not like that.

362
00:47:21.526 --> 00:47:25.027
<i>You have to be apt at wonder
when you're a Surpriser.</i>


363
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.069
<i>When you're a what?</i>

364
00:47:26.152 --> 00:47:27.778
<i>The Master Surprisers</i>

365
00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.527
<i>were the active members
of the Flowerburger.</i>


366
00:47:33.403 --> 00:47:37.028
<i>Even, and especially, in times of war,</i>

367
00:47:37.111 --> 00:47:38.528
<i>a handful of them</i>

368
00:47:38.612 --> 00:47:41.278
<i>met in the hold of the Flowerburger</i>

369
00:47:41.362 --> 00:47:45.279
<i>to practice poetry,
like you practice a religion.</i>


370
00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:48.529
<i>They went on commando raids
of pure poetry.</i>


371
00:47:49.238 --> 00:47:52.239
<i>Clandestinely distributed forbidden books.</i>

372
00:47:52.322 --> 00:47:56.364
<i>Hid the strange toys they made
on windowsills:</i>


373
00:47:56.447 --> 00:47:58.364
<i>unicorns, dragons...</i>

374
00:47:58.447 --> 00:47:59.572
<i>Mermaids?</i>

375
00:47:59.656 --> 00:48:02.864
<i>Yes, maybe. 
I don't remember everything.</i>

376
00:48:04.657 --> 00:48:06.823
<i>The Flowerburger Book.</i>

377
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:10.782
<i>The spirit of the Surprisers
is chronicled inside.</i>


378
00:48:10.865 --> 00:48:12.740
<i>Their greatest accomplishments,</i>

379
00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:14.741
<i>the stories, the drawings...</i>

380
00:48:15.741 --> 00:48:18.658
<i>Before she passed away,
Sylvia gave it to Gaspard.</i>


381
00:48:23.283 --> 00:48:27.117
<i>"One day, my grandson,
you will read this book</i>


382
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.535
<i>and, more importantly,
you'll write its sequel."</i>


383
00:48:34.409 --> 00:48:36.326
<i>It was a secret society</i>

384
00:48:36.409 --> 00:48:39.660
whose members lived only
for wonder and panache.


385
00:48:39.743 --> 00:48:40.868
Panache.

386
00:48:41.868 --> 00:48:44.327
What is "panache"?

387
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:47.536
That is the heart of the matter, sweetie!

388
00:48:48.203 --> 00:48:50.370
Doing things for the beauty of it.

389
00:48:51.119 --> 00:48:53.161
The spirit of adventure.

390
00:48:53.787 --> 00:48:55.870
The art of surprise!

391
00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:57.829
Imagination,

392
00:48:58.787 --> 00:49:01.079
friendship, humor,

393
00:49:01.162 --> 00:49:02.996
and above all,

394
00:49:03.079 --> 00:49:04.496
love.

395
00:49:06.247 --> 00:49:08.247
Why are you telling me all this?

396
00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:10.871
Because without love, 
Gaspard's done for.

397
00:49:11.413 --> 00:49:13.789
The Flowerburger is his engine,

398
00:49:13.872 --> 00:49:16.373
but his fuel is the heart.

399
00:49:16.456 --> 00:49:19.831
He needs help reclaiming his true self.

400
00:49:20.873 --> 00:49:22.873
Are you a Surpriser, too?

401
00:49:24.498 --> 00:49:25.790
That's the past.

402
00:49:25.873 --> 00:49:27.165
I'm off.

403
00:49:27.249 --> 00:49:28.499
What's this perfume?

404
00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:30.791
Smells awful!

405
00:49:31.582 --> 00:49:34.541
Don't tell Gaspard I came by.
It's our secret.


406
00:49:34.624 --> 00:49:36.874
But if you need tips to seduce him,
ask me.


407
00:49:36.958 --> 00:49:39.959
I know everything.
His favorite songs, everything!


408
00:49:40.041 --> 00:49:41.917
And I'm right next door.

409
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.793
This blue liquid is blood.

410
00:49:49.876 --> 00:49:53.459
But the plasma analysis was impossible
to cross-check.


411
00:49:53.543 --> 00:49:56.502
The creature it belongs to
is perfectly unknown.


412
00:49:56.585 --> 00:50:00.377
You gave me the blood sample
of a new species.


413
00:50:01.211 --> 00:50:04.002
The corpuscles that give
the blood this color


414
00:50:04.086 --> 00:50:06.795
carry a low amount of oxygen.

415
00:50:08.461 --> 00:50:13.670
The creature cannot survive for long
far from the ocean's depths.


416
00:50:17.587 --> 00:50:19.130
I'm a calamity these days.

417
00:50:19.629 --> 00:50:21.546
I lost the Flowerburger Book.

418
00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.463
It's a sign. Move on.

419
00:50:27.964 --> 00:50:29.755
How can you say that, Dad?

420
00:50:30.672 --> 00:50:32.630
It has poems handwritten by Mom.

421
00:50:37.464 --> 00:50:39.589
You have many talents, son, but...

422
00:50:41.298 --> 00:50:42.923
moving on isn't your thing.

423
00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:47.298
I can't fight you. 
You're gifted.

424
00:50:47.882 --> 00:50:50.299
Fighting is the heart of the matter.

425
00:50:51.091 --> 00:50:54.133
A woman leaves you, you reject love.

426
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.425
Your boat leaks, you reject sailing home.

427
00:50:58.508 --> 00:51:00.092
You have a problem with failure.

428
00:51:00.175 --> 00:51:02.092
You have a problem with panache.

429
00:51:03.968 --> 00:51:05.051
Panache.

430
00:51:07.051 --> 00:51:08.843
Panache, son,

431
00:51:10.635 --> 00:51:13.110
is accepting failure and bouncing back,
not avoiding reality.


432
00:51:14.093 --> 00:51:16.136
That's the true spirit of the Surprisers.

433
00:51:16.844 --> 00:51:18.386
Who cares about the book?

434
00:51:21.886 --> 00:51:23.594
Who cares about the book?

435
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.931
<i>-Yes?
-Hurry, Gaspard!</i>


436
00:51:52.015 --> 00:51:54.098
<i>Your apartment's burning!</i>

437
00:52:02.016 --> 00:52:02.849
Have you seen this?

438
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:11.558
A MERMAID IN PARIS?

439
00:52:36.935 --> 00:52:38.894
Chief, everything OK?

440
00:52:40.728 --> 00:52:41.728
Listen...

441
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:46.687
It's as if the smoke were singing.

442
00:52:47.437 --> 00:52:49.229
You need some rest.

443
00:52:49.812 --> 00:52:51.396
Let's go, we're done.

444
00:52:56.479 --> 00:52:58.730
-The firemen are here.
-What happened?


445
00:52:58.813 --> 00:53:00.272
She must be hiding.

446
00:53:00.355 --> 00:53:01.439
Where?

447
00:53:04.897 --> 00:53:05.897
Hello.

448
00:53:06.814 --> 00:53:09.439
You're lucky. The entire building
could have burned down.


449
00:53:10.148 --> 00:53:12.607
Be careful when putting out
your cigarettes.


450
00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:15.982
-Or stop smoking.
-I don't smoke.


451
00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:22.898
Thank you.

452
00:53:25.649 --> 00:53:27.066
Good luck.

453
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:28.858
I don't believe this.

454
00:53:42.693 --> 00:53:43.693
Lula?

455
00:54:02.862 --> 00:54:03.987
Are you OK?

456
00:54:14.238 --> 00:54:15.238
What happened?

457
00:54:15.322 --> 00:54:18.822
I leave you with a movie in the tub,
I come home to a fire.


458
00:54:18.905 --> 00:54:20.155
What the hell?

459
00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.697
I'm taking you to Rossy's.

460
00:54:24.572 --> 00:54:26.906
She has a bathtub. Come on.

461
00:54:27.406 --> 00:54:29.740
-But why?
-Because.


462
00:54:38.699 --> 00:54:39.908
Shit.

463
00:54:51.284 --> 00:54:52.867
-Can you lock your bathroom?
-Yes.


464
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:54.201
Don't let her out.

465
00:54:54.284 --> 00:54:57.326
I have urgent matters to deal with.
Then I'll take her back to the water.


466
00:54:57.409 --> 00:54:58.493
Water?

467
00:55:00.618 --> 00:55:03.577
Gaspard, are you OK? You're pale.

468
00:55:04.494 --> 00:55:05.494
I'm OK.

469
00:55:09.911 --> 00:55:11.161
I'm counting on you.

470
00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:22.919
You should stop smoking.

471
00:56:23.002 --> 00:56:25.460
I thought you had to smoke
to be a Surpriser.


472
00:56:25.543 --> 00:56:28.586
Sure, it gives you style,
but you'll find something else.


473
00:56:28.669 --> 00:56:29.795
Gaspard, he's...

474
00:56:33.419 --> 00:56:34.920
I'll leave you two alone.

475
00:56:42.378 --> 00:56:43.587
I'm so sorry.

476
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:48.421
You don't have much time left.

477
00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:50.588
I could tell you the same.

478
00:56:53.755 --> 00:56:55.130
How's your wound?

479
00:56:57.756 --> 00:56:59.589
It's still a bit sore.

480
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:01.672
But it's much better.

481
00:57:04.631 --> 00:57:06.715
And I've decided to stop smoking.

482
00:57:11.799 --> 00:57:13.174
I'll take you back now.

483
00:57:14.341 --> 00:57:15.965
It's for the best.

484
00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:27.509
What would you like to do before leaving?

485
00:57:28.842 --> 00:57:30.176
Parisian fish?

486
00:57:33.009 --> 00:57:34.259
I'll get you some.

487
00:57:36.176 --> 00:57:38.885
And a shower crooner song?

488
00:57:40.593 --> 00:57:41.635
Be right back.

489
00:58:06.721 --> 00:58:07.888
We have to make a record.

490
00:58:08.596 --> 00:58:09.430
"Rescord?"

491
00:58:09.514 --> 00:58:10.430
A record.

492
00:58:12.639 --> 00:58:13.764
That's it.

493
00:58:13.847 --> 00:58:15.472
With a voice like yours, we have to.

494
00:58:16.514 --> 00:58:17.764
A killer record.

495
00:58:17.847 --> 00:58:20.431
<i>Oh, my bathroom mermaid</i>

496
00:58:20.515 --> 00:58:23.223
<i>You rubber-ducky goddess</i>

497
00:58:23.306 --> 00:58:26.015
<i>I'd love for you to confess</i>

498
00:58:26.099 --> 00:58:28.807
<i>How you make my sadness fade</i>

499
00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.599
<i>You are slowly falling</i>

500
00:58:31.683 --> 00:58:33.975
<i>In love with me</i>

501
00:58:34.474 --> 00:58:36.891
<i>Like every man in history</i>

502
00:58:36.975 --> 00:58:39.808
<i>Who has heard my melody</i>

503
00:58:39.891 --> 00:58:42.392
<i>Oh, my little Lula</i>

504
00:58:42.475 --> 00:58:44.850
<i>If you only knew</i>

505
00:58:45.267 --> 00:58:47.892
<i>How sad and broken I was</i>

506
00:58:47.976 --> 00:58:50.601
<i>In last winter's snow</i>

507
00:58:50.685 --> 00:58:53.351
<i>I no longer feel the joy</i>

508
00:58:53.434 --> 00:58:55.977
<i>My heart's a broken toy</i>

509
00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.769
<i>It's all over, 
I've closed the door</i>

510
00:58:58.851 --> 00:59:01.602
<i>I'm immune, you see</i>

511
00:59:10.937 --> 00:59:12.104
I think it's ready.

512
00:59:17.271 --> 00:59:18.771
It's gonna be a hit.

513
00:59:18.854 --> 00:59:19.896
A hit?

514
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:24.230
What's wrong?

515
00:59:24.729 --> 00:59:25.729
Nothing.

516
00:59:26.772 --> 00:59:28.605
You're falling in love with me.

517
00:59:30.689 --> 00:59:31.855
No, not at all.

518
00:59:33.772 --> 00:59:35.481
You set my flat on fire.

519
00:59:35.564 --> 00:59:36.939
And you're not my type.

520
00:59:37.773 --> 00:59:41.315
Your voice is beautiful,
but I'm done with singers.


521
00:59:43.148 --> 00:59:45.148
Besides, what do you know about love?

522
00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:51.857
How does love feel?

523
00:59:57.066 --> 00:59:58.441
It's like joy.

524
01:00:01.775 --> 01:00:02.942
And it stings.

525
01:00:03.776 --> 01:00:04.859
It stings?

526
01:00:06.776 --> 01:00:07.776
Very hard.

527
01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:12.443
That voice...

528
01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:15.902
I never heard a voice like it before.

529
01:00:17.111 --> 01:00:18.194
What voice?

530
01:00:18.944 --> 01:00:20.652
Where did you hear it?

531
01:00:21.777 --> 01:00:23.027
-Answer me!
-Milena!


532
01:00:23.778 --> 01:00:25.528
-Calm down.
-You calm down!


533
01:00:25.611 --> 01:00:27.319
You calm down.

534
01:00:39.863 --> 01:00:41.196
I'm going to find her.

535
01:00:41.572 --> 01:00:43.572
Expect grilled fish on the menu.

536
01:00:43.655 --> 01:00:45.280
Great, I love fish!

537
01:00:45.363 --> 01:00:49.197
Bass, sole, sea bream... 
I love sea bream.

538
01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:52.447
And sardines. Sardines are good, too.

539
01:01:06.574 --> 01:01:08.032
Here's a deal.

540
01:01:08.575 --> 01:01:10.700
We go to the Flowerburger. Not long.

541
01:01:10.783 --> 01:01:12.992
And at midnight,
I put you back in the water.


542
01:01:13.075 --> 01:01:15.242
-Really?
-Yes, I promise.


543
01:01:15.325 --> 01:01:17.492
It'll be our farewell party.

544
01:01:18.325 --> 01:01:21.784
Like a honeymoon, only backwards.

545
01:01:22.367 --> 01:01:23.534
Honeymoon?

546
01:01:24.742 --> 01:01:26.535
Yes, like married people.

547
01:02:21.499 --> 01:02:22.499
Water?

548
01:02:26.499 --> 01:02:27.332
The Paris Opera!

549
01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:31.833
-All good back there?
-Yes!


550
01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:33.834
Great.

551
01:02:48.085 --> 01:02:50.002
Wait for me. Be right back.

552
01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:02.003
Miss.

553
01:03:10.837 --> 01:03:12.838
FOR SALE

554
01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:43.966
You stand me up,

555
01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:46.300
then you appear
like a flower in a burger?


556
01:03:46.883 --> 01:03:48.341
My beloved son!

557
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.633
Dad, tonight, please behave.

558
01:03:52.717 --> 01:03:54.759
A disabled opera singer? Good boy.

559
01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.843
Henri, the best table
for Gaspard and his lady!


560
01:03:58.926 --> 01:04:01.676
-It's already taken...
-Make it happen!


561
01:04:02.634 --> 01:04:03.634
My dad...

562
01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:10.260
-Come on...
-Aren't you introducing me?


563
01:04:10.344 --> 01:04:11.886
Sure... My dad.

564
01:04:12.386 --> 01:04:13.386
Lula.

565
01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.637
You can't eat that.

566
01:04:32.555 --> 01:04:35.472
I didn't know that trick.
It's sensational.


567
01:04:36.347 --> 01:04:38.472
"Trout Fishing in America" for two.

568
01:04:39.014 --> 01:04:40.222
House specialty.

569
01:04:42.805 --> 01:04:43.805
Thanks.

570
01:04:47.973 --> 01:04:50.140
That's an Olympic descent!

571
01:04:50.223 --> 01:04:51.640
Worthy of...

572
01:04:51.723 --> 01:04:52.931
Kitzbühel!

573
01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:55.932
Henri, two Kiss-burgers!

574
01:04:56.016 --> 01:04:58.766
The best burger for a kiss
at the Flowerburger.


575
01:04:58.849 --> 01:05:00.516
Come on, Dad...

576
01:05:01.642 --> 01:05:02.974
-Sublime.
-Yes.


577
01:05:04.975 --> 01:05:06.350
What does "kiss" mean?

578
01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:09.725
Good question. Thanks, Dad.

579
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:11.808
It's a love thing.

580
01:05:11.892 --> 01:05:15.018
You can try anytime,
but it's best to be in love.


581
01:05:16.351 --> 01:05:17.185
Does it sting?

582
01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:20.352
Depends.

583
01:05:22.143 --> 01:05:23.143
Kitzbühel!

584
01:05:30.728 --> 01:05:31.936
You're a nice one.

585
01:05:34.311 --> 01:05:36.645
I tried to kill you
and you call me nice?

586
01:05:36.728 --> 01:05:38.103
It was nice to let me know.

587
01:05:45.729 --> 01:05:46.938
You can sing here.

588
01:05:47.938 --> 01:05:51.104
With a mermaid on stage,
we'd be sold out every night.


589
01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.189
-You're forgetting something.
-What?


590
01:05:55.772 --> 01:05:57.022
When I sing, people die.

591
01:05:59.773 --> 01:06:02.814
True. It's not good for business.

592
01:06:29.567 --> 01:06:31.692
As is the family tradition,

593
01:06:32.193 --> 01:06:35.193
let's see what's inside Lula's heart.

594
01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:39.944
You can't oppose
the Surprisers' oldest tradition!


595
01:06:43.152 --> 01:06:45.611
If he whacks her, she's gonna be pissed.

596
01:06:46.152 --> 01:06:47.402
Go, Gaspard!

597
01:06:48.194 --> 01:06:49.945
Put your heart in it!

598
01:06:50.778 --> 01:06:51.611
Aim!

599
01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:15.822
Your opera singer has a good heart!

600
01:07:16.322 --> 01:07:18.364
You can fall in love safely, son.

601
01:07:18.447 --> 01:07:19.781
Enjoy your evening!

602
01:07:24.824 --> 01:07:26.782
You know my family now.

603
01:07:37.866 --> 01:07:39.033
Good evening.

604
01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:58.743
It's not a real one.

605
01:08:03.078 --> 01:08:05.619
Just passing through.
Pretend I'm not here.


606
01:08:16.496 --> 01:08:17.620
Olympic indeed.

607
01:08:24.787 --> 01:08:29.747
When I get caught in fishermen's nets,
after they die, I drink their alcohol.


608
01:08:29.831 --> 01:08:30.705
I see.

609
01:08:31.872 --> 01:08:32.789
No one ever survives?

610
01:08:34.705 --> 01:08:35.705
Never.

611
01:08:39.206 --> 01:08:40.623
Since the dawn of time,

612
01:08:41.248 --> 01:08:43.164
men have wanted us dead.

613
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:50.706
When my mother died,
a desire for revenge came over me.


614
01:08:52.623 --> 01:08:53.707
What happened?

615
01:09:00.042 --> 01:09:04.126
One day, a sailor tried to steal
some of my scales.


616
01:09:07.418 --> 01:09:09.168
He pierced my fin.

617
01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:12.334
My mother went crazy.

618
01:09:13.627 --> 01:09:15.585
She attacked him...

619
01:09:18.252 --> 01:09:19.710
and bit him violently.

620
01:09:26.919 --> 01:09:28.627
He stabbed her in the heart.

621
01:09:31.837 --> 01:09:33.003
I'm sorry.

622
01:09:37.378 --> 01:09:39.087
So you lost your mother, too.

623
01:09:43.337 --> 01:09:46.047
If I'd had my song,
I could have saved her.


624
01:09:49.714 --> 01:09:51.381
I'm the last living mermaid.

625
01:09:53.673 --> 01:09:56.297
Singing is my only defense.

626
01:10:07.841 --> 01:10:09.383
How many sailors have you killed?

627
01:10:11.133 --> 01:10:12.299
Come on, tell me.

628
01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:16.217
43, 44?

629
01:10:17.591 --> 01:10:18.633
That many!

630
01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:25.676
Funny, I've almost had
the same number of girlfriends.


631
01:10:26.427 --> 01:10:27.510
That many!

632
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:35.261
Some mattered more than others.
But that's a different story.


633
01:10:42.761 --> 01:10:45.137
I'm so happy
you're not under my charm.


634
01:11:01.346 --> 01:11:03.972
That's the most beautiful declaration
of non-love ever.


635
01:11:11.848 --> 01:11:14.140
<i>...who have heard my melody</i>

Veal, Milena?

Don't pay attention.

663

Just kidding.

01:13:40.363 --> 01:13:42.198
It's just that we serve it here.

665
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.490
Do you know whom this belongs to?

666
01:13:46.406 --> 01:13:47.823
I know he'll be pleased.

667
01:14:01.866 --> 01:14:03.617
We only have 30 minutes left.

668
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.742
You can still surprise me.

669
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:08.034
Isn't that your specialty?

670
01:14:08.992 --> 01:14:10.117
You've got a point.

671
01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.665
You're the best Surpriser I know.

672
01:15:16.582 --> 01:15:18.166
Know many?

673
01:15:18.249 --> 01:15:19.083
No.

674
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:22.625
But you're the best one I know.

675
01:15:23.167 --> 01:15:24.167
By far!

676
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:25.459
Thank you very much.

677
01:15:34.043 --> 01:15:35.168
Almost there.

678
01:15:38.210 --> 01:15:39.210
Careful.

679
01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.753
It's late.

680
01:15:56.796 --> 01:15:58.712
So late even owls have red-eye.

681
01:15:59.212 --> 01:16:00.504
Shouldn't we go home?

682
01:16:02.545 --> 01:16:03.921
Want to go for a dip?

683
01:18:36.062 --> 01:18:38.312
-We'd said midnight, didn't we?
-Yes.


684
01:18:39.396 --> 01:18:40.521
We'd said midnight.

685
01:18:52.147 --> 01:18:53.855
Too bad you have to leave, though.

686
01:18:54.439 --> 01:18:55.982
I was immune.

687
01:18:57.439 --> 01:18:59.190
My dear Gaspard,

688
01:19:00.357 --> 01:19:01.940
handsome Gaspard,

689
01:19:03.274 --> 01:19:04.858
it's time to go now.

690
01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.732
What if you stayed with me?

691
01:19:10.275 --> 01:19:11.191
What?

692
01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:15.483
What if you lived with me?
I'd take care of you.


693
01:19:16.859 --> 01:19:18.317
But you know the risks.

694
01:19:19.442 --> 01:19:21.025
I would have died already!

695
01:19:21.609 --> 01:19:23.025
No, it's too dangerous.

696
01:19:26.026 --> 01:19:27.401
So I saw in two days.

697
01:19:30.652 --> 01:19:32.068
I won't miss you at all.

698
01:19:40.361 --> 01:19:41.778
I'll do everything for you.

699
01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:46.528
And when you're homesick,
I'll take you to any ocean you want.


700
01:19:46.611 --> 01:19:50.070
I'll learn to scuba dive,
so I can follow you.


701
01:19:57.779 --> 01:19:58.779
Gaspard...

702
01:20:02.989 --> 01:20:04.156
One last surprise.

703
01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:09.787
It's not a real coral reef,

704
01:21:09.871 --> 01:21:11.787
but with a little imagination...

705
01:21:11.871 --> 01:21:14.580
You can change the world,
at least our own,


706
01:21:14.663 --> 01:21:16.705
which is an excellent start.

707
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.997
The Surprisers' motto.

708
01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.747
You know what I'd love?

709
01:21:21.372 --> 01:21:22.747
A real fish!

710
01:21:23.706 --> 01:21:25.205
Can you find one?

711
01:21:36.999 --> 01:21:39.458
I'd rob a Chinese restaurant
with a water pistol


712
01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:40.915
to get you fish.

713
01:21:40.999 --> 01:21:42.291
Give me 15 minutes?

714
01:22:17.378 --> 01:22:18.378
Rossy!

715
01:22:33.671 --> 01:22:36.088
Yes, sweetie, I'm here! 
What do you need?

716
01:22:37.005 --> 01:22:38.630
It's marvelous!

717
01:22:39.881 --> 01:22:41.006
Incredible!

718
01:22:42.256 --> 01:22:43.505
Thank you!

719
01:22:43.589 --> 01:22:46.089
Gaspard has recovered his inner Surpriser.

720
01:22:46.506 --> 01:22:48.089
Such beauty!

721
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.174
Help me escape, please.

722
01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:53.840
Escape?

723
01:22:54.965 --> 01:22:56.257
From him?

724
01:22:56.882 --> 01:22:57.883
Why?

725
01:22:59.883 --> 01:23:02.091
He can't see me, otherwise he'll die.

726
01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:04.383
Die?

727
01:23:05.467 --> 01:23:07.342
What are you talking about?

728
01:23:07.425 --> 01:23:09.675
I've never seen him this happy.

729
01:23:09.759 --> 01:23:11.425
I just saw him.

730
01:23:11.508 --> 01:23:13.134
He was walking on air.

731
01:23:13.217 --> 01:23:15.593
If you care about him, take me now.

732
01:23:15.676 --> 01:23:18.801
Before he gets back.
Please, get me out of here.


733
01:23:18.885 --> 01:23:20.343
What's going on, Lula?

734
01:23:20.885 --> 01:23:22.135
What is it, honey?

735
01:23:22.635 --> 01:23:24.010
Please, take me back.

736
01:23:56.722 --> 01:23:58.056
What are you doing here?

737
01:23:59.181 --> 01:24:00.222
Where's Lula?

738
01:24:00.306 --> 01:24:02.306
Where she won't cause harm!

739
01:24:02.389 --> 01:24:03.973
Where is she? Answer me!

740
01:24:04.056 --> 01:24:05.681
-Calm down.
-Where?


741
01:24:05.765 --> 01:24:06.890
You're under her spell!

742
01:24:06.973 --> 01:24:08.765
She's killing you like she killed Victor!

743
01:24:08.848 --> 01:24:11.140
Tell me where she is!

744
01:24:20.183 --> 01:24:22.808
<i>Oh, my bathroom mermaid</i>

745
01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:25.975
<i>You rubber-ducky goddess</i>

746
01:24:27.434 --> 01:24:29.726
<i>I'd love for you to confess</i>

747
01:24:29.808 --> 01:24:32.726
<i>How you made my sadness fade</i>

748
01:24:33.893 --> 01:24:36.060
<i>Take me away...</i>

749
01:24:40.268 --> 01:24:41.268
What are you doing?

750
01:24:41.352 --> 01:24:42.977
Taking a blood sample

751
01:24:43.894 --> 01:24:45.228
before it's too late.

752
01:24:45.977 --> 01:24:47.686
I need to understand her toxicity.

753
01:24:47.769 --> 01:24:51.770
Look at the state she's in.
Taking more blood could kill her.


754
01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:53.270
If she dies, she dies.

755
01:24:56.728 --> 01:24:57.562
Stop!

756
01:24:59.604 --> 01:25:00.729
Get out!

757
01:25:16.022 --> 01:25:17.939
Gaspard...

758
01:25:19.898 --> 01:25:21.190
Is he OK?

759
01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:26.565
He's dying.

760
01:25:27.899 --> 01:25:30.066
Like all the men you get close to.

761
01:25:31.482 --> 01:25:33.024
It's not his fault.

762
01:25:34.899 --> 01:25:36.816
It wasn't Victor's fault either.

763
01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:41.483
Milena! Please come, it's urgent.

764
01:25:41.566 --> 01:25:42.442
We need you!

765
01:25:42.526 --> 01:25:44.609
It's another heart attack.

766
01:25:44.692 --> 01:25:46.651
The patient says he's hearing voices.

767
01:25:48.151 --> 01:25:49.400
Coming.

768
01:26:04.736 --> 01:26:06.820
Gaspard, it's me.

769
01:26:06.903 --> 01:26:08.237
Come on, time to go.

770
01:26:49.491 --> 01:26:51.699
-Where's my patient?
-Which patient?


771
01:27:04.784 --> 01:27:07.992
Henri and your dad made it.
I added salt water.


772
01:27:13.493 --> 01:27:17.202
"Those whose imagination is so powerful

773
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:20.619
that they can change the world."

774
01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:22.494
Go, quickly! To the Seine!

775
01:27:22.577 --> 01:27:23.410
I can do better.

776
01:27:23.494 --> 01:27:25.161
I'll take her much further.

777
01:27:36.579 --> 01:27:37.579
Where are they going?

778
01:27:38.329 --> 01:27:41.579
-What are you going to do?
-Prevent other disasters.


779
01:27:41.663 --> 01:27:43.704
Don't you see your friend's going to die?

780
01:27:45.622 --> 01:27:46.705
He's going to die.

781
01:27:48.664 --> 01:27:50.164
He's taking her back to the water.

782
01:27:51.997 --> 01:27:53.081
On the docks.

783
01:27:53.164 --> 01:27:55.123
Next to the Flowerburger.

784
01:28:03.748 --> 01:28:05.040
Thank you!

785
01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:09.833
That's it, run!

786
01:28:10.958 --> 01:28:13.958
Poor thing's got no imagination!

787
01:28:17.333 --> 01:28:19.417
The Flowerburger...

788
01:28:56.921 --> 01:28:58.171
<i>This just in:</i>

789
01:28:58.713 --> 01:29:01.213
<i>a car hitched with a tub
on a country road.</i>


790
01:29:01.296 --> 01:29:03.380
-Where?
<i>-Side road 613.</i>


791
01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:05.296
<i>After the place known as the Old Oak.</i>

792
01:29:35.467 --> 01:29:36.883
I'll take this, too.

793
01:29:39.759 --> 01:29:40.926
This and...

794
01:29:41.884 --> 01:29:43.093
This is for the gas.

795
01:29:43.718 --> 01:29:45.510
Keep the change. Thanks.

796
01:30:00.386 --> 01:30:04.178
To talk to me, press here.
I have the other one. OK?


797
01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:11.929
<i>I was blown</i>

798
01:30:12.512 --> 01:30:13.846
<i>Blown to bits</i>

799
01:30:14.762 --> 01:30:15.763
<i>I was blown</i>

800
01:30:15.846 --> 01:30:18.388
<i>To kaleidoscope bits</i>

801
01:30:18.471 --> 01:30:19.930
<i>In your arms</i>

802
01:30:21.264 --> 01:30:22.431
Lula, do you copy?

803
01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.222
Gaspard...

804
01:30:28.764 --> 01:30:29.764
It stings.

805
01:30:34.432 --> 01:30:35.432
Very hard.

806
01:30:40.473 --> 01:30:42.890
<i>A little each day</i>

807
01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.600
<i>Drowning</i>

808
01:30:49.975 --> 01:30:51.850
<i>No, I swear</i>

809
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:54.267
<i>Never more</i>

810
01:30:54.851 --> 01:31:00.143
<i>Did I want to fall in love forevermore</i>

811
01:31:00.226 --> 01:31:01.393
<i>Fly away</i>

812
01:31:02.393 --> 01:31:04.894
<i>Blown away</i>

813
01:31:04.977 --> 01:31:07.643
<i>Falling back on our hearts</i>

814
01:31:07.727 --> 01:31:10.561
<i>In the light forevermore</i>

815
01:31:10.644 --> 01:31:13.102
<i>A little each day</i>

816
01:31:13.728 --> 01:31:15.769
<i>Falling back...</i>

817
01:35:38.506 --> 01:35:40.382
<i>Mr. Snow, hello.</i>

818
01:35:40.465 --> 01:35:43.048
<i>Pierre Martin,
biologist at Saint André Hospital.</i>


819
01:35:43.131 --> 01:35:47.091
<i>I analyzed the strange pearls
that belong to your friend Lula.</i>


820
01:35:47.174 --> 01:35:50.132
<i>I hope you received the vial.</i>

821
01:35:50.924 --> 01:35:55.257
<i>They're pure mother of pearl
of exceptional fineness.</i>


822
01:35:55.341 --> 01:35:58.217
<i>And they're set
with gold and rough diamonds.</i>


823
01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.925
<i>I thought
this treasure was rightfully yours.</i>


824
01:36:01.509 --> 01:36:04.384
<i>These tears, after all,
were shed for you.</i>


825
01:36:04.926 --> 01:36:06.467
<i>I hope you'll be better soon.</i>

826
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:07.550
<i>Goodbye.</i>

827
01:36:17.010 --> 01:36:18.010
Off you go!
