1
00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.589
Welcome aboard. There we are.

2
00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.064
There we are, take that.
Do you want some more?


3
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.296
There, take that one.
You'll enjoy throwing those.


4
00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:26.602
Look, by the car! 
I can see his face.

5
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.393
Goodbye!

6
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.941
Attention, please. Last call.

7
00:02:57.277 --> 00:03:00.178
All visitors must leave the ship. Thank you.

8
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.612
Have you said a prayer
for the journey, Sister?


9
00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:05.777
Not yet.
I'm so worried about the mixed bathing.


10
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.418
Who's that man?

11
00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.617
I suppose it's the captain.
Looks like Ted Heath.


12
00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.122
- On your own?
- Yes.


13
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.261
Welcome!

14
00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:23.360
- Wave.
- Thank you.


15
00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:24.802
Wave to your father.

16
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.065
One for you.

17
00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:32.969
Stop skiving, you bugger.

18
00:03:33.547 --> 00:03:35.071
Bye-bye, Dad.

19
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.333
All right!

20
00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.399
Come on.

21
00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.401
Welcome aboard.
Your last orders for streamers.


22
00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.447
You want me to throw it?

23
00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:29.867
- Probably been searching for drugs.
- Maybe he's been arrested.


24
00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:36.465
You all right?

25
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.134
Yes, thank you.

26
00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:43.446
- Right, Humphrey, my place or yours?
- Bleeding mess!


27
00:04:57.531 --> 00:05:01.228
So much for farewell parties.
Put that cigarette out!


28
00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:05.064
Welcome aboard, sir.

29
00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:06.765
Welcome on board.

30
00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:09.307
I can't guess
what you're going to say to me.


31
00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:10.434
Try.

32
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.034
"Welcome aboard."

33
00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:16.075
You've been on a ship before, haven't you?

34
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.117
Welcome aboard. Welcome!

35
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.851
- You come to amuse us?
- No, I've come to watch you work.


36
00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:25.949
That's a joke, for a start.

37
00:05:29.196 --> 00:05:31.926
We think it's in the gears.
Getting it out now.


38
00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:40.868
- Get that damn thing up.
- Right, sir.


39
00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:43.068
Come on, move yourself, lad.

40
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.138
Charlie!

41
00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:48.204
My tea, please.

42
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:52.785
Come on, below decks. 
Haven't got all day.

43
00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:04.463
Morning, sir.

44
00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:31.354
- Come to eat.
- Just a minute.


45
00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:33.655
- Come on.
- Just a minute!


46
00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:35.851
Nancy, come on.

47
00:06:56.049 --> 00:07:00.110
Good evening. All passengers
are invited to the Atlantic Lounge...


48
00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:03.446
where a game of cutthroat Bingo
will take place.


49
00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:06.754
The caller being yours truly, Mr. Curtain.

50
00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.762
All the fours, knickers!

51
00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:13.095
Little song, little song entitled...

52
00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:16.567
I Can't Get Over You,
So I'll Have To Get Up and Go Round.


53
00:07:52.405 --> 00:07:53.872
Good evening, ladies.

54
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.034
This is to remind you
that our hairdressing salon is now open.


55
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.409
Anthony, our coiffeur, is waiting
to give you his personal attention.


56
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.469
Thank you.

57
00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:07.518
- Mr. Curtain.
- Thank you very much.


58
00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:09.953
- Madam?
- No.


59
00:08:10.824 --> 00:08:12.348
For you, madam?

60
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.653
How can he eat?

61
00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:26.394
Excuse me.

62
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:47.192
Come on, you dogs, walkies.

63
00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:50.454
I'll have you in the bloody curry
if you don't move.


64
00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:01.406
- Jesus! I'm sorry.
- No, no.


65
00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:02.907
I'm terribly sorry.

66
00:09:02.976 --> 00:09:04.637
Are you all right?

67
00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:09.844
Not that line there. That line there.
Except when you're serving.


68
00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:12.578
It's that line there. 
Now your service.

69
00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:13.778
That's it!

70
00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.980
Mr. Curtain, everybody happy?

71
00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:21.352
There's Bingo at 10:00,
fancy dress party tonight.


72
00:09:21.528 --> 00:09:24.156
- Sister, wait.
- Blimey, they're early!


73
00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.526
34-31 west, sir.

74
00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:32.897
Almost mid
-Atlantic. Not bad, considering...

75
00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:37.103
Not bad considering the ship's
still being rebuilt around our ears.


76
00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:42.241
- Morning, Number One.
- Morning, Sparky.


77
00:09:42.349 --> 00:09:44.112
- Sparky.
- Morning, Jim.


78
00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:46.379
Latest weather advertisement.

79
00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:56.955
It should make the Captain sing with joy.

80
00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.861
I'll check my theory.

81
00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:06.533
Come in.

82
00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.501
Good morning, sir.

83
00:10:08.575 --> 00:10:10.600
Good morning, Number One.

84
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.906
Have you brought me some weather?

85
00:10:15.248 --> 00:10:16.272
Yes.

86
00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:20.519
You know Mrs. Bannister.

87
00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:24.656
- My first officer, Mr. Hollingsworth.
- Good morning, Mr. Hollingsworth.


88
00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:25.986
Did you sleep well?

89
00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:27.287
Spasmodically.

90
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.454
I see.

91
00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:31.556
Chief, Alex here.

92
00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:36.235
Look, we persuaded the company
to spend £40,000 on new gyros.


93
00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:39.271
It might be good fun if they worked,
don't you think?


94
00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:40.863
What are gyros?

95
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:45.409
- They stop the ship from rolling.
- Is that what it said on the wrapper?


96
00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:47.874
The company's just bought them.

97
00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:50.939
Then the company
must have bought them second-hand.


98
00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:52.780
We're working on it.

99
00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:57.920
What's this drum supposed to be?

100
00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:02.350
I don't know, sir.
Turned up after the refit.


101
00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:05.159
Bloody shipyard!
If they'd finished their job in time...


102
00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:08.564
we wouldn't be carrying half their garbage
over the... Yes, sir!


103
00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:10.899
- Leave it with us, sir.
- Tell me, how long?


104
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.562
The best part of the day.

105
00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:16.336
I'm sure the passengers
will be thrilled to bits. Thank you, Freddy.


106
00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.808
My pleasure.

107
00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:22.272
I'd offer you some,
but there's only two cups.


108
00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.339
Thank you, I've already had some.

109
00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:25.406
Coffee.

110
00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:31.252
Is everything
going to be smooth and beautiful?


111
00:11:31.324 --> 00:11:33.792
Of course! You read the brochure.

112
00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:37.754
Slow her down to 16...

113
00:11:38.231 --> 00:11:41.826
and notify the office that we'll be in
overtime with the New York dock crew.


114
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:45.428
Company's going to moan about that.
Chairman's always pleading poverty.


115
00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:48.030
That's the chairman's job, isn't it?

116
00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:49.973
Thank you, Number One.

117
00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:52.571
Wind building...

118
00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:54.645
Force 8.

119
00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:57.682
Is that rough?

120
00:11:58.017 --> 00:11:59.177
Yes.

121
00:12:00.587 --> 00:12:02.885
Starboard, 10. Steady on 3.

122
00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:07.321
My theory was right.

123
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.084
Mrs. Bannister?

124
00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:11.496
£5, you owe me.

125
00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:13.087
Extortion.

126
00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:15.501
Please try and eat something.

127
00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:16.967
Christopher!

128
00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.938
Christopher, breakfast!

129
00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:23.975
The pencil's writing again, Daddy.

130
00:12:25.812 --> 00:12:27.575
Try to be sensible.

131
00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:37.279
What's it say?

132
00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:41.816
It says a few hundred pounds.
Now, please, be careful, will you.


133
00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:48.823
- Yes?
- Mr. Nicholas Porter?


134
00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:51.803
- Yes, speaking.
- Managing Director of the Sovereign Line?


135
00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.031
Yes, who is this?

136
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.633
For the purpose of this,
and subsequent conversations...


137
00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.199
my name is...

138
00:12:58.378 --> 00:12:59.743
Juggernaut.

139
00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:03.580
I'm ringing about your ship, the Britannic.

140
00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:06.045
Yes, what about her?

141
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.587
Seven explosive devices...

142
00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:11.316
7,000 pounds of amatol...

143
00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:14.322
have been placed aboard your vessel.

144
00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:19.295
If she holds her present position,
shortly after dawn tomorrow...


145
00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.465
Britannic's time, she will blow up.

146
00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:26.806
The time is 9:16.

147
00:13:27.507 --> 00:13:29.532
Exactly six minutes ago...

148
00:13:30.043 --> 00:13:32.671
my devices were automatically armed...

149
00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:34.645
by clockwork mechanism.

150
00:13:35.682 --> 00:13:38.207
They are now live, active...

151
00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.742
and waiting for the dawn.

152
00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:45.120
It follows that I have the information...

153
00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:47.591
that will render the bombs harmless.

154
00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:51.789
I will give you this information,
Mr. Porter...


155
00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:53.990
for the very modest sum...

156
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.100
of £500,000.

157
00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:02.637
I do not wish to see anybody harmed,
Mr. Porter.


158
00:14:03.276 --> 00:14:04.709
Any loss of life...

159
00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:08.213
resulting from your company's refusal
to cooperate...


160
00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:12.277
will be your responsibility and yours alone.

161
00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:15.848
No doubt you will instruct your captain...

162
00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:19.289
to make an immediate search
for my devices.


163
00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.824
He will find seven steel drums.

164
00:14:23.463 --> 00:14:25.260
Fifty-gallon drums...

165
00:14:25.732 --> 00:14:29.998
painted green
with a yellow band near the top.


166
00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.400
Once they are located...

167
00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:35.202
no attempt should be made to move them.

168
00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:39.778
If the position of any drum is altered...

169
00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:43.273
it will explode instantaneously.

170
00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:47.547
Any attempt to dismantle
any of the devices...


171
00:14:48.054 --> 00:14:50.181
will have the same result.

172
00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:53.453
An immediate explosion.

173
00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:58.260
The devices are booby-trapped
in various ways.


174
00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:00.729
I need hardly add...

175
00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:04.870
that I would not have embarked
on an enterprise of this kind...


176
00:15:05.505 --> 00:15:07.939
if I were not totally confident...

177
00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:11.441
of my own expertise in these matters.

178
00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:16.337
I realize
you will have to discuss this matter...


179
00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:18.542
with your fellow directors...

180
00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:21.212
and with the appropriate authorities.

181
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:23.589
You will hear from me...

182
00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:25.521
from Juggernaut...

183
00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:27.485
within two hours.

184
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.594
I will then give you precise instructions
about the payment...


185
00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:34.832
of the £500,000.

186
00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:39.701
To demonstrate my skill and sincerity...

187
00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:43.432
I have arranged a small demonstration...

188
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.935
which should occur
as I am speaking to you.


189
00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:51.914
I trust this will cause no serious
personal injury.


190
00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:14.101
There we are, my old flower.

191
00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.900
I won't hurt you.

192
00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:28.151
Look at this.

193
00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:30.314
What a pitiful little bomb.

194
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.581
Would you like a biscuit?

195
00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:36.620
I can't stand enthusiastic amateurs.

196
00:16:38.264 --> 00:16:40.494
I hate to bother you, Skipper...

197
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.000
but the radio in the truck's for you.

198
00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:45.269
Rather urgent, they say.

199
00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:46.532
Got it!

200
00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:48.897
This is also...

201
00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.065
rather urgent.

202
00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:54.705
He does say he's an admiral,
if that makes any difference.


203
00:16:54.781 --> 00:16:57.579
So he's an admiral. 
So he can get stuffed.

204
00:16:59.285 --> 00:17:01.276
It's a big job coming up.

205
00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:03.548
Where?

206
00:17:03.723 --> 00:17:05.714
Mid
-Atlantic, on a liner.

207
00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:09.054
I need a holiday.

208
00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:20.095
The old firm...

209
00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:22.597
the best in the business.

210
00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.879
The undefeated champion!

211
00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:31.045
Knocked out the first round...

212
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:32.677
no contest.

213
00:17:32.752 --> 00:17:34.117
Okay, lads.

214
00:17:34.454 --> 00:17:37.287
You clean up, we'll go collect our medals.

215
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.655
Fallon's the champion!

216
00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:43.757
Can we go back in now, please?

217
00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:48.096
Doesn't anybody work
in this bloody country anymore?


218
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:49.891
Look at that!

219
00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:52.666
- Can we really go in?
- Can we go back in now?


220
00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.468
A quick chat to an admiral and then...

221
00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:58.200
Yeah, Charlie!

222
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.000
Move along.

223
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.011
Thank you.

224
00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:09.550
Juggernaut's bomb...

225
00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:13.081
his so-called demonstration bomb...

226
00:18:13.893 --> 00:18:16.191
exploded 20 minutes ago on board.

227
00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.786
- Damage?
- Minor.


228
00:18:17.864 --> 00:18:19.855
- Anyone hurt?
- One injury.


229
00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:24.431
He said dawn tomorrow. 
What time is that?

230
00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:30.699
She's sailing a minimum-speed pattern.

231
00:18:31.978 --> 00:18:35.607
That's near 35 degrees west,
plus two time zones.


232
00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:39.480
Her dawn will come at 6:10,
that's 8:10 our time.


233
00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:45.686
Which gives us just
under 22 hours to find...


234
00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:47.281
your "Juggernaut."

235
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.884
Is it possible?

236
00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:50.894
I'll know that at 8:10 tomorrow.

237
00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:54.223
Now, what we're doing is...

238
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.326
we're going to set up
a special operations center.


239
00:18:57.403 --> 00:19:01.032
There's no shortage of manpower.
It's time, is the problem.


240
00:19:01.541 --> 00:19:03.907
We've got our telephone trace organized...

241
00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.376
for when he calls again, if he calls.

242
00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:09.313
We've gone through our list
of possible suspects.


243
00:19:09.382 --> 00:19:12.442
That is,
all the boys who understand big bangs.


244
00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:14.586
Because I lay odds...

245
00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:17.848
our friend learned his trade
in the Armed Forces.


246
00:19:17.924 --> 00:19:20.188
That can only be an assumption
at the moment.


247
00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.250
However, here is our list.

248
00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:26.765
I've arranged for the War Office
to supply you with their radical list.


249
00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:29.124
Arabs, Irish, anarchists.

250
00:19:32.238 --> 00:19:33.432
Marder.

251
00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:35.740
An explosives ordnance disposal team...

252
00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:38.038
under Lieutenant Commander
Anthony Fallon...


253
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.204
will be on its way to the Britannic
in just a few minutes' time.


254
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.273
They are under orders to immediately defuse
Juggernaut's devices.


255
00:19:49.956 --> 00:19:52.789
May I say, for the Sovereign Line,
how much we appreciate...


256
00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:56.760
the efficiency and urgency
that has been shown by the Services...


257
00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.590
and by the police.

258
00:19:59.966 --> 00:20:02.764
My wife and two
kids are on the Britannic.

259
00:20:10.343 --> 00:20:13.335
Before we move on, I wonder, Mr. Porter...

260
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.073
will you please clarify your company's
intentions in this matter?


261
00:20:19.185 --> 00:20:20.379
Intentions?

262
00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:22.318
Your course of action.

263
00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:26.122
We intend to wait for Juggernaut's call...

264
00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:28.990
note his instructions, and pay the ransom.

265
00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:30.619
No.

266
00:20:32.198 --> 00:20:35.292
- What would you suggest?
- Not paying the ransom.


267
00:20:37.203 --> 00:20:40.001
We're well aware of the risks, Mr. Porter.

268
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.730
But it is the view
of Her Majesty's government...


269
00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:46.300
the view, the policy, the determination...

270
00:20:46.946 --> 00:20:49.506
to resist extortion by terror.

271
00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:52.012
It isn't a hasty decision.

272
00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:54.882
It's the result of a long series
of similar situations...


273
00:20:54.954 --> 00:20:56.922
both at home and abroad.

274
00:20:57.523 --> 00:20:59.650
It's a simple question of responsibility.

275
00:20:59.725 --> 00:21:03.161
Responsibility to ourselves
and to other governments.


276
00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:07.893
Responsibility to 1,200 people
aboard my ship, that's my responsibility.


277
00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:12.167
I take the point,
but we can't consider this case in isolation.


278
00:21:12.238 --> 00:21:15.435
If you take a broad enough view,
you can justify anything.


279
00:21:15.508 --> 00:21:17.738
Let us examine the broad view.

280
00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:19.839
Sovereign Line...

281
00:21:19.912 --> 00:21:23.143
a firm that has received substantial
government subsidies...


282
00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:25.206
and a £20 million loan.

283
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:27.809
- Do you buy my conscience with a subsidy?
- No.


284
00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:31.085
But we have the right
to your understanding.


285
00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:36.021
And if we proceed regardless
and pay the ransom?


286
00:21:37.063 --> 00:21:39.725
That's your right, in a free democracy.

287
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.927
To coin a phrase.

288
00:21:46.372 --> 00:21:50.809
The Armed Forces are, of course,
obliged to conform to government policy.


289
00:21:53.212 --> 00:21:54.577
No opinion.

290
00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:01.775
Yes?

291
00:22:01.854 --> 00:22:03.219
Mr. Nicholas Porter?

292
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:04.415
Speaking.

293
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.958
Managing Director of the Sovereign Line?

294
00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:08.254
Juggernaut.

295
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.659
How are things aboard your ship?

296
00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:13.288
There's been an explosion.

297
00:22:13.566 --> 00:22:15.397
Hardly that, Mr. Porter.

298
00:22:16.302 --> 00:22:19.271
Not what I call a real explosion.

299
00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:22.731
I've seen real explosions, Mr. Porter.

300
00:22:23.609 --> 00:22:25.076
They destroy people.

301
00:22:25.711 --> 00:22:28.839
It's very important
that you understand one thing.


302
00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:32.682
The ship has encountered very bad weather.

303
00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:34.717
Gales, very heavy seas.

304
00:22:34.787 --> 00:22:38.154
There is no way
that the passengers can be taken off.


305
00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:40.752
Blue Boy Trace...

306
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.820
50 Grosvenor Street.

307
00:22:42.895 --> 00:22:45.090
Registered, House of Worth...

308
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:47.264
- Fashion House.
- Three blocks.


309
00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:49.927
- Blue Force respond.
- Too bloody near.


310
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.263
How do we defuse the bombs?

311
00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:55.170
Here are your instructions.

312
00:22:55.975 --> 00:22:59.206
At the Lost and Found counter
of Waterloo Station...


313
00:22:59.278 --> 00:23:03.146
you will ask
for two matched plaid suitcases...


314
00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:06.617
bearing the initials D.J.S.

315
00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.978
In one of the cases,
you will find a brown windcheater.


316
00:23:11.724 --> 00:23:14.921
In its pocket, a
key to locker Number 93...

317
00:23:14.994 --> 00:23:17.588
at the West London Air Terminal.

318
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.664
These suitcases, and only these...

319
00:23:20.766 --> 00:23:23.963
are to be packed with £20 notes.

320
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:25.761
The sum...

321
00:23:25.838 --> 00:23:29.035
will be exactly £500,000.

322
00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:32.735
The serial numbers on the notes
will be random.


323
00:23:33.946 --> 00:23:35.004
Someone...

324
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.843
not me, of course...

325
00:23:36.949 --> 00:23:40.510
will collect the cases
from the Air Terminal luggage locker.


326
00:23:41.454 --> 00:23:44.184
If any attempt is made to follow him...

327
00:23:44.323 --> 00:23:47.486
you will not hear from me again,
and your ship...


328
00:23:48.227 --> 00:23:49.558
will sink.

329
00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:55.000
I said, too bloody near!

330
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.164
Crafty sod. Two lines.

331
00:23:57.236 --> 00:23:59.864
One feeding in, other feeding out.

332
00:24:11.884 --> 00:24:13.749
Dangling us on a wire.

333
00:24:19.091 --> 00:24:21.924
If the sea looks too rough,
don't be afraid of going under.


334
00:24:21.994 --> 00:24:24.155
- The oxygen will keep you alive.
- Really?


335
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.357
The deeper you are, the safer you are.

336
00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:28.093
You're the expert.

337
00:24:28.868 --> 00:24:30.529
- First trip?
- Yeah.


338
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:33.069
Don't worry.
The law of gravity's on your side.


339
00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:35.971
Just like falling out of an airplane.
Your first trip, too?


340
00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:37.303
Yes, sir.

341
00:24:38.344 --> 00:24:39.572
Charlie.

342
00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:45.777
You don't like boats, do you?

343
00:24:45.985 --> 00:24:47.714
No, I bloody don't.

344
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.350
- How much longer?
- Three hours.


345
00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:55.085
- Weather like?
- Lousy! But it's getting worse.


346
00:24:55.661 --> 00:24:57.959
Two chaps there never even saw
parachutes before.


347
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.430
Yes, I don't like
the smell of this one.

348
00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:02.160
Why don't you pack it in, then?

349
00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:04.031
Absolutely no chance.

350
00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:06.831
Give you the man's name,
the man's telephone number.


351
00:25:06.906 --> 00:25:09.739
Nice cushy job, working the oil rig.

352
00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:12.572
Jump on the oil boom, no risks.
Light your own fuses...


353
00:25:12.645 --> 00:25:15.136
- and take care of your family.
- Why don't you take it?


354
00:25:15.214 --> 00:25:16.181
No family...

355
00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:18.105
no mortgages and no future.

356
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:20.276
But I do have one small talent...

357
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.944
developed to near perfection.

358
00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:24.649
Yes, the undefeated champion, are you?

359
00:25:25.424 --> 00:25:28.484
I wish it was a talent
for playing the violin.


360
00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:31.724
All right, Charlie.

361
00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.033
No!

362
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.340
- Mr. Curtain!
- I'm sorry.


363
00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.247
Steady!

364
00:25:51.317 --> 00:25:53.308
The next "I Spy" is mine!

365
00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:56.385
Despite the inclement weather...

366
00:25:56.522 --> 00:25:59.685
the deck tennis tournament
will still take place.


367
00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:01.749
All passengers wishing to enter...

368
00:26:01.827 --> 00:26:05.194
should put their names down
on the notice on the bulletin.


369
00:26:05.264 --> 00:26:06.663
- Officer.
- Yes, sir.


370
00:26:06.732 --> 00:26:09.724
Do you mind telling me
why we're traveling in circles?


371
00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:11.531
- Circles, sir?
- A while ago...


372
00:26:11.604 --> 00:26:15.005
the waves were coming from the front,
now they're coming from the side.


373
00:26:15.074 --> 00:26:16.598
It's that kind of sea, sir.

374
00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:18.199
North Atlantic, you know.

375
00:26:18.277 --> 00:26:21.474
A half-hour ago, the sun was on the port,
now it's on the starboard.


376
00:26:21.547 --> 00:26:24.311
- Is it that kind of sun?
- Must check the steering gear.


377
00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:27.011
And about that explosion this morning.

378
00:26:28.554 --> 00:26:30.852
Just blowing of Number Two boiler, sir.

379
00:26:30.923 --> 00:26:33.016
Buddy, I am by profession a politician.

380
00:26:33.092 --> 00:26:36.118
The mayor of a rather large city,
as a matter of fact.


381
00:26:36.195 --> 00:26:38.561
In my line of work,
you have to learn to lie...


382
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:40.531
with remarkable precision.

383
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:44.330
You also have to know how to recognize
a lie when it bites you in the ass.


384
00:26:44.403 --> 00:26:46.394
And I have just been bitten.

385
00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.934
I'll...

386
00:26:50.242 --> 00:26:53.143
convey your complaint to the captain, sir.

387
00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:56.280
Owing to circumstances
beyond our control...


388
00:26:56.515 --> 00:27:00.975
the ship's pool "How many miles
we've traveled during the day"...


389
00:27:01.253 --> 00:27:03.483
will now no longer take place.

390
00:27:03.589 --> 00:27:06.114
Can we have some more money
for the fruit machines?


391
00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:08.659
We didn't come on this ship
to feed fruit machines.


392
00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:10.957
- Why did we come?
- To be sick.


393
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.624
Pardon?

394
00:27:13.732 --> 00:27:16.462
David, there's a book over there for you.

395
00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:21.103
I spy Ships.

396
00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:23.333
Isn't there anything for me?

397
00:27:25.177 --> 00:27:28.271
- I think there's a big hole in the ship.
- Good!


398
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:30.542
Come in.

399
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:34.985
Tea and toast for madam.

400
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.587
- Thank you, but I really don't think...
- No, good for you.


401
00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:41.558
There's a big hole
in the ship, isn't there?

402
00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:43.954
No. No hole in ship.

403
00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:46.026
All the sailors seem worried.

404
00:27:46.098 --> 00:27:49.363
No. Not worried. 
Everything fine.

405
00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.632
Be brave.

406
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.433
I'm going to spy that hole.

407
00:28:16.295 --> 00:28:17.785
Lunch for madam.

408
00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:20.798
Thank you.
It's very thoughtful of somebody.


409
00:28:22.301 --> 00:28:24.792
- You happy in your work?
- Very much.


410
00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:27.798
It's a good ship?

411
00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.430
It's my home.

412
00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:32.101
Your home won't keep still.

413
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.274
I'm born in Africa.

414
00:28:35.514 --> 00:28:38.813
Black government doesn't like me,
because I'm Asian.


415
00:28:39.118 --> 00:28:42.952
Go to England, and white government
doesn't like me because I'm Asian.


416
00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:45.221
So, my home.

417
00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:48.925
- It's a sad world for refugees.
- I'm very happy on this ship.


418
00:28:48.994 --> 00:28:52.054
I don't believe you.
I think you're all very unhappy...


419
00:28:52.131 --> 00:28:53.530
and nervous.

420
00:28:53.632 --> 00:28:55.930
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.


421
00:28:56.001 --> 00:28:57.730
It's very bad seas.

422
00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.828
You ask Captain?

423
00:28:59.905 --> 00:29:04.239
I can't go around asking the Captain
intimate questions about his ship.


424
00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:07.835
Oh, dear, oh, dear!

425
00:29:14.186 --> 00:29:16.017
Liverpool playing Chelsea Saturday.

426
00:29:16.088 --> 00:29:18.579
Liverpool? We'll bloody murder them!

427
00:29:18.657 --> 00:29:21.285
- Bunch of fairies, Liverpool.
- Get off!


428
00:29:28.534 --> 00:29:31.230
That means the ship's carrying explosives.

429
00:29:31.537 --> 00:29:33.402
Give myself 15 points.

430
00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:37.198
- Are we supposed to be earthed on a ship?
- I don't know.


431
00:29:37.276 --> 00:29:39.267
Return to 2-7-0.

432
00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.674
- Signal to all vessels.
- 2-7-0, sir.


433
00:29:41.747 --> 00:29:45.148
"Am experiencing difficulties
of an extraordinary nature.


434
00:29:45.217 --> 00:29:49.153
"Would appreciate assistance if our position
can be reached by dawn tomorrow.


435
00:29:49.221 --> 00:29:51.815
- "I will sail box pattern."
- Right, sir.


436
00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:54.687
Some of the passengers
are asking questions.


437
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.127
- Any specific question?
- Why are we sailing in circles?


438
00:29:58.197 --> 00:30:00.995
Tell them that we enjoy sailing in circles.

439
00:30:01.066 --> 00:30:04.160
That seven men are going to jump
into the sea from an airplane.


440
00:30:04.236 --> 00:30:06.466
- They'll think I'm joking.
- So?


441
00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:15.980
- A question.
- Yes?


442
00:30:16.248 --> 00:30:19.615
Is it still your ambition
to be captain of this ship?


443
00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:24.145
- May I give you my answer tomorrow?
- Answer a question with a question.


444
00:30:24.223 --> 00:30:27.420
You ought to be a politician,
not a first officer.


445
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.522
We'll try launching a boat
when our friends show up.


446
00:30:30.596 --> 00:30:32.325
Pick up stragglers.

447
00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:33.522
In this?

448
00:30:33.599 --> 00:30:35.931
You can skipper it, if you like.

449
00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:39.094
I'd prefer to take the boat out myself,
of course...


450
00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:41.467
but you know.

451
00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:42.731
Yes.

452
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.135
I'll only take two seamen.

453
00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:49.237
Don't want to overload it.

454
00:30:49.915 --> 00:30:52.975
If we pull this off,
I'll change my profession.


455
00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:54.175
Politics?

456
00:30:54.253 --> 00:30:56.619
The church. Excuse me.

457
00:31:04.496 --> 00:31:08.227
All passengers who had their photographs
taken last night...


458
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.930
may view the photographs...

459
00:31:11.003 --> 00:31:15.030
which will be on display
very shortly in the table tennis room.


460
00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:17.866
Hello!

461
00:31:17.943 --> 00:31:21.106
When I tried the haddock today,
it came right up my nose.


462
00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:22.669
53.

463
00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:34.723
54.

464
00:31:34.793 --> 00:31:36.192
I'll get it.

465
00:31:51.176 --> 00:31:52.234
Yes.

466
00:31:52.311 --> 00:31:54.779
Radio Room, sir. 
Your call to Mr. Porter.

467
00:31:55.414 --> 00:31:56.813
Scrambler, please.

468
00:31:56.882 --> 00:31:58.907
Scrambler. Aye, sir.

469
00:32:01.119 --> 00:32:03.087
This is Britannic. 
Do you hear me?

470
00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:09.052
You can do better than that!

471
00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:11.388
Sorry.

472
00:32:12.464 --> 00:32:14.932
Britannic here. Do you hear me? Over.

473
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.092
Alex?

474
00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:17.894
Nicholas speaking.

475
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.736
Nick. I want the whole picture.
What do I tell my passengers?


476
00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:23.035
Tell them the truth.

477
00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:27.169
And tell them a Naval bomb disposal team
will be there within the hour.


478
00:32:27.245 --> 00:32:30.806
- An officer called Fallon...
- Has the money been laid on?


479
00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:36.176
We're not paying, Alex.

480
00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:37.619
Not paying?

481
00:32:37.823 --> 00:32:40.758
We've looked carefully at the situation.
We've taken advice.


482
00:32:40.826 --> 00:32:42.589
You didn't ask my advice.

483
00:32:42.661 --> 00:32:45.323
Scotland Yard's working for us,
the Armed Forces...


484
00:32:45.397 --> 00:32:47.388
You didn't ask my advice!

485
00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:52.228
Look, we catch the man, disarm the bomb.
There's still 16 hours to go.


486
00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.029
Bloody nonsense!

487
00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:57.797
Believe me, Alex, it's a much bigger game
than you can imagine.


488
00:32:57.876 --> 00:33:02.040
It's 1,200 passengers and crew.
Do you know a bigger game than that?


489
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:05.541
You have no alternative
but to accept my decision.


490
00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:12.253
All right.

491
00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:14.525
But it'd better not be your decision.

492
00:33:14.593 --> 00:33:16.083
Alex, please...

493
00:33:22.968 --> 00:33:25.596
I thought you put your case admirably.

494
00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:30.802
Come in.

495
00:33:33.912 --> 00:33:35.004
Oh, you.

496
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.674
- Please...
- I apologize for being me.


497
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:40.279
Go away.

498
00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:44.717
Why don't you call
me later in the week?

499
00:33:50.729 --> 00:33:51.923
All right, let's go.

500
00:33:51.997 --> 00:33:54.966
Service Intelligence dug out

501
00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:56.660
going back to the Boer War.

502
00:33:56.735 --> 00:34:00.728
So eliminating dead, aged and infirm,
leaves us 46 possibilities.


503
00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:03.902
Right. This guy O'
Neill looks interesting.

504
00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:07.502
- He's inside. Doing 10 years.
- Down the Scrubs, isn't he?


505
00:34:08.313 --> 00:34:10.543
He's very clever. He's Irish.

506
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:13.317
Now, we'll check he's inside... No...

507
00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:16.411
- I'll check he's inside.
- He might be able to point a finger.


508
00:34:16.488 --> 00:34:19.753
You've got the London list,
and you've got the politicals.


509
00:34:19.825 --> 00:34:23.090
How did he get the bombs on the ship?
That's what I don't understand.


510
00:34:23.161 --> 00:34:25.322
No security, that's why.

511
00:34:25.397 --> 00:34:27.957
Check what comes off the ship,
but not what goes on.


512
00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:30.263
Bloody dockyard thieves, rivets for brains.

513
00:34:30.335 --> 00:34:32.235
Why don't you piss off?

514
00:34:33.939 --> 00:34:37.204
- Good luck, Brownie.
- Yes, thanks. Look, I'm sorry.


515
00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:39.675
- What?
- About the wife and family.


516
00:34:40.212 --> 00:34:44.649
You heard what Skinner said. Stuff it.
It's all a bloody lottery, anyway.


517
00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.929
Look, David.

518
00:35:00.866 --> 00:35:02.697
There's an airplane.

519
00:35:12.644 --> 00:35:14.043
She's a big bastard, isn't she?

520
00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:23.377
- Move out the davits.
- Aye, aye, sir.


521
00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:45.903
Now I understand the circles.

522
00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:47.069
What?

523
00:35:47.946 --> 00:35:49.914
Is it dropping the mail?

524
00:35:50.448 --> 00:35:51.710
You!

525
00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:04.757
- Okay, sir.
- Lower away. Down.


526
00:36:24.416 --> 00:36:26.407
Take her over to the port side.

527
00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:27.974
I'll try, sir.

528
00:36:33.592 --> 00:36:35.492
Try to hold her steady.

529
00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:42.999
Keep her head into it.

530
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.398
Hercules, this is Britannic.

531
00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.272
Hercules, this is Britannic. Over.

532
00:36:51.343 --> 00:36:53.402
Britannic this is Hercules. Over.

533
00:36:53.478 --> 00:36:57.710
When your men are ready to jump,
we'll try to give them a smooth sea.


534
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.744
I'll make a lee off our port beam.
Do you read? Over.


535
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.084
Yes, I read you, Britannic. Over.

536
00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:08.387
We've launched our pick-up boat
about 500 yards off our port quarter.


537
00:37:08.627 --> 00:37:10.185
Do you see her? Over.

538
00:37:10.262 --> 00:37:12.662
Yes, we see her, Britannic. Over.

539
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:22.729
- You're a good navigator, aren't you?
- Good? I'm a perfect navigator.


540
00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.138
Are you a good jumper?

541
00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:25.642
Stay and watch.

542
00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:29.811
- Turn 1-8-0.
- 1-8-0, sir.


543
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:33.240
1-8-0, helmsman.

544
00:37:41.293 --> 00:37:43.261
This is my second trip...

545
00:37:43.662 --> 00:37:46.597
and I've never seen anything like it before.

546
00:37:54.406 --> 00:37:56.033
All right, chaps.

547
00:37:56.241 --> 00:37:58.539
Double somersault with a twist.

548
00:38:07.185 --> 00:38:08.482
Try not to think about it.

549
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:12.347
Green light. Good luck, jumpers.

550
00:38:20.532 --> 00:38:22.932
Christ! Bloody mask!

551
00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:34.578
Bring her around.

552
00:38:38.817 --> 00:38:39.909
Help!

553
00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:44.886
Let go the ladders.

554
00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:47.991
Ladders away, sir!

555
00:39:10.215 --> 00:39:11.546
So many.

556
00:39:21.793 --> 00:39:24.557
All right, lads. 
Stick together.

557
00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:30.258
Don't wander away. 
Swim under the waves.

558
00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.166
He looks like my Action Man.

559
00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:40.306
- It is Action Man.
- It isn't.


560
00:39:41.646 --> 00:39:45.343
Head for the boat.
The current will pull us back.


561
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:57.353
What?

562
00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:58.621
He's going down.

563
00:39:58.696 --> 00:40:00.288
Yes. Go get him!

564
00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:38.160
Kick! Kick, you bastard!

565
00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:14.368
Come on.

566
00:41:38.363 --> 00:41:40.456
You're not there yet, lads.

567
00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:42.555
Take it easy.

568
00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:46.493
I don't want to
lose any of you now.

569
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.754
Man overboard!

570
00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:22.131
- Aren't you going back for him?
- It's impossible! It's not a car.


571
00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:25.232
We have a 5-mile turning circle.
When we get back, he'll be gone.


572
00:42:49.634 --> 00:42:50.828
Fallon.

573
00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.196
Hardy.

574
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:55.296
Welcome to Britannic, sir.

575
00:42:55.974 --> 00:42:57.134
Great!

576
00:43:06.184 --> 00:43:07.981
Get off, it's my go!

577
00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:09.076
It's mine.

578
00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:10.620
...that they are bombs.

579
00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:12.417
It could be a hoax.

580
00:43:13.124 --> 00:43:15.854
Second, if they are bombs...

581
00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:19.257
then the Navy will see to the defusing.

582
00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:23.764
Commander Fallon
is a skilled and experienced man...


583
00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:26.998
leading a skilled and experienced team.

584
00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:31.903
Inevitably, certain sections of the ship
will be sealed off.


585
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:36.746
But because of the refit,
we're all used to that, anyway.


586
00:43:41.853 --> 00:43:44.515
The situation in London
is that Scotland Yard...


587
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:47.285
has got the investigation well in hand.

588
00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:49.992
Now if there are any questions...

589
00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:01.204
How long until dawn, Captain?

590
00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:04.837
A good 12 hours. 
Plenty of time.

591
00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:08.367
Captain, without being an alarmist...

592
00:44:08.446 --> 00:44:13.247
we're sailing on a ship
that might hypothetically be blown up.


593
00:44:13.785 --> 00:44:17.050
And the sea is so strong,
it's too rough for the lifeboats.


594
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:18.611
That's about it, isn't it?

595
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:20.487
Yes, that's about it.

596
00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:24.160
Thanks for your candor, Captain.

597
00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:27.322
Just wanted a clear picture
for my wife's diary.


598
00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:31.593
- What's he smiling at?
- Well, that's all.


599
00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.229
Thank you very much for listening to me.

600
00:44:34.806 --> 00:44:36.205
What's that?

601
00:44:37.942 --> 00:44:39.534
- Sorry.
- Sorry.


602
00:44:40.311 --> 00:44:41.471
Go on.

603
00:44:45.383 --> 00:44:46.441
What do we do?

604
00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:50.044
- I'm taking two sleeping tablets.
- There's not much you can do, is there?


605
00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:51.986
I've lost them again.

606
00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:55.557
As I was saying,
before I was so politely interrupted...


607
00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:01.655
Tonight's fancy dress ball
will continue as per program...


608
00:45:01.733 --> 00:45:04.031
and as if nothing had happened!

609
00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:07.098
Are we downhearted?

610
00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:10.936
Just a little.

611
00:45:11.342 --> 00:45:12.741
Shall we go?

612
00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:16.505
If anyone wants costumes,
I'm the fellow to see.


613
00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:21.046
Sparks, would you consider
bringing Mr. Fallon's unit up to strength?


614
00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:22.343
Sir?

615
00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.251
Your skill in electronics
makes you an obvious choice.


616
00:45:32.263 --> 00:45:34.128
Now do you understand?

617
00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:37.466
Well, I...

618
00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:40.536
I see the problem, but...

619
00:45:41.072 --> 00:45:42.403
I'm sorry.

620
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.635
I think you're just doing all of this
to impress me.


621
00:45:48.279 --> 00:45:49.769
I'm impressed.

622
00:45:52.617 --> 00:45:55.848
"'Come into my parlor,'
said the spider to the fly.


623
00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:59.784
"Off went the plate, in came the fly.

624
00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:03.384
"She was glamorously
and amorously molested."


625
00:46:04.028 --> 00:46:05.757
Let's listen to it.

626
00:46:24.415 --> 00:46:27.145
- I'm looking for your skipper.
- He's down the line.


627
00:46:27.218 --> 00:46:29.550
He's got his own little problem.

628
00:46:34.492 --> 00:46:37.017
- You've lost one of your men.
- Right.


629
00:46:37.929 --> 00:46:40.523
I've been detailed to take his place.

630
00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:42.130
Volunteered.

631
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.128
Welcome.

632
00:46:47.672 --> 00:46:50.573
- What's the plan?
- Haven't got a clue.


633
00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:53.075
Have you got any ideas?

634
00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:02.445
Commander.

635
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.784
There she is, my fearful beauty.

636
00:47:04.856 --> 00:47:07.791
Alive and well, and living in sin.

637
00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:12.495
Commander, Captain's briefed
the passengers and crew.


638
00:47:12.563 --> 00:47:14.929
- He'd like to speak to you.
- Charlie.


639
00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:18.400
- Skipper?
- The clock's suspended in the shaft.


640
00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:21.263
And the stopper won't reach?

641
00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.664
Try the scope.

642
00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:34.208
How do we break in?

643
00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:36.809
Not through the plate, for a start.

644
00:47:41.392 --> 00:47:44.293
I'll bring you back some dry toast, Charlie.

645
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:54.594
Marvelous cure for sea-sickness...

646
00:47:54.906 --> 00:47:56.396
blind terror.

647
00:47:57.575 --> 00:47:59.304
Where are the kids?

648
00:47:59.377 --> 00:48:01.208
Asleep, theoretically.

649
00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:04.477
They might be helping the Navy.

650
00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:09.917
What are we supposed to do?

651
00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:12.751
I might dance naked at the ball tonight.

652
00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:15.649
That could raise a laugh.

653
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.358
My husband wouldn't allow that.

654
00:48:18.796 --> 00:48:20.696
Neither would my shape.

655
00:48:21.966 --> 00:48:24.264
- Where is your husband?
- London.


656
00:48:25.136 --> 00:48:27.400
He's a humane policeman.

657
00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:31.472
He sent us all off to visit my sister
in the States.


658
00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:32.770
Relax...

659
00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:35.039
unwind.

660
00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:36.702
Theoretically.

661
00:48:41.619 --> 00:48:43.883
Have you got anybody?

662
00:48:44.622 --> 00:48:45.953
Husband...

663
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.855
two men...

664
00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:50.292
maybe three.

665
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:52.791
I'm not sure I've got anybody.

666
00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:57.757
Go down with the ship, it'll be three lines
in the Philadelphia Inquirer.


667
00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:02.332
I might get drunk.

668
00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:06.504
- Does that idea appeal to you?
- Just a quick one.


669
00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:09.037
You know, responsibilities.

670
00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:12.912
- It's like the poem.
- Which one?


671
00:49:13.584 --> 00:49:15.449
Not Waving But Drowning.

672
00:49:23.027 --> 00:49:24.460
O'Neill, W.

673
00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:26.452
Hello, Johnny.

674
00:49:27.365 --> 00:49:28.525
Major.

675
00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:30.961
Thanks.

676
00:49:35.406 --> 00:49:37.499
Who's been blowing up what?

677
00:49:37.775 --> 00:49:40.801
- What makes you think anyone has?
- Well, I...


678
00:49:41.112 --> 00:49:42.875
Can't be friendship.

679
00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:47.717
You wouldn't be dragging me from my
bedtime cocoa like this, would you?


680
00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:49.579
Right.

681
00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:58.355
I want to know
who's active on the sea.

682
00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:00.891
Yes. Well, now...

683
00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:03.761
I'm not a grass, 
I don't point fingers.

684
00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:06.064
You must be pretty desperate.

685
00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:10.104
Yes, I am.

686
00:50:11.976 --> 00:50:14.171
- Lives at stake.
- Yes.


687
00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:18.048
Let me see, I've done three years.

688
00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:20.049
That leaves seven to go.

689
00:50:20.551 --> 00:50:24.282
Seven to go with a bit of luck,
and a decent Home Secretary.


690
00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:27.320
I don't care, Johnny.

691
00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:30.019
I really don't care who gets blown up.

692
00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:33.220
I might know a few things.

693
00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:36.631
Might tell you lies, tantalize you a bit.

694
00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:39.669
But I don't really care that much.

695
00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:43.906
It's all up here in my head.

696
00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:46.670
And that's where it's staying.

697
00:50:48.913 --> 00:50:50.141
Thanks.

698
00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:02.319
Can you plug this into the amp?

699
00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:08.958
I wish you wouldn't do that.

700
00:51:09.066 --> 00:51:10.658
Can't get it in.

701
00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:14.226
- Everything all right, Mr. Curtain?
- A night to remember.


702
00:51:14.305 --> 00:51:16.398
Can you hold the plug a minute?

703
00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:20.103
We're short on squeakers because
one of the cupboards has been sealed off...


704
00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:21.644
but in times of crisis...

705
00:51:21.712 --> 00:51:24.579
One squeaker between two
answer your problem?


706
00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:27.082
That's why you're a first officer.

707
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.387
I wish you wouldn't do that, cock!

708
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:35.684
All bombs below the water line,
except this one here, by the galley.


709
00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:38.159
And if they all explode together?

710
00:51:38.629 --> 00:51:40.119
One big hole...

711
00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:41.494
you sink.

712
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.198
Fuel tanks under, but they can be emptied.

713
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.397
No critical gear.

714
00:51:48.706 --> 00:51:50.571
Yes, that's where we'll start.

715
00:51:51.642 --> 00:51:53.542
Just one little hole.

716
00:51:55.246 --> 00:51:57.680
That's the one we play with first.

717
00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:00.447
If my ship were
an aircraft in the sky...

718
00:52:00.518 --> 00:52:02.952
there'd be no question
of playing with her life.


719
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.147
We'll try cutting a hole into the drum.

720
00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.554
My employers would be
on every street corner...


721
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:09.786
looking for someone to hand their money to.

722
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:13.762
- At least we can contain the blast.
- This is still my ship.


723
00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:22.495
It's my ship now, Captain.
At least until dawn tomorrow.


724
00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:25.268
Or maybe earlier.

725
00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:27.970
Will you join me?

726
00:52:30.681 --> 00:52:33.047
Here's to your ship.

727
00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:38.282
I'm sorry for your troubles,
but I do have a few of my own.


728
00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:40.550
To the insanity of governments...

729
00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:42.819
and the insanity of people
who oppose them.


730
00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:46.522
And the poor simple sods
who have to pick up the pieces.


731
00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:51.828
He's clever, your Juggernaut.

732
00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:54.126
Try "obsessed."

733
00:52:55.806 --> 00:52:57.569
You're all obsessed.

734
00:53:00.144 --> 00:53:02.772
Might even save your life, Captain...

735
00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.670
my obsession.

736
00:53:05.583 --> 00:53:06.880
There are seven bombs.

737
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:09.647
How do you know
he built them all the same?


738
00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.017
If he didn't...

739
00:53:11.088 --> 00:53:13.682
you will be one
of the first to know.

740
00:53:25.169 --> 00:53:27.137
Funny place to find you, Mr. Baker.

741
00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:29.297
Just filling in.

742
00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.104
Always work for skillful hands.

743
00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:34.175
Filling in between what?

744
00:53:34.245 --> 00:53:36.713
If it's about bombs, explosives,
things that go bang...


745
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.407
- It is.
- Then excuse me.


746
00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:41.613
I only work abroad.

747
00:53:42.453 --> 00:53:45.388
And my last job
was for the Foreign Office.

748
00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:48.720
They didn't tell you.
They promised to take my name off the list.


749
00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:51.283
You can't trust anybody these days.

750
00:53:51.362 --> 00:53:53.694
Complete details of your movements.

751
00:53:53.764 --> 00:53:55.789
- When?
- Today for starters.


752
00:53:56.533 --> 00:54:00.264
Give us the right answers,
you might get your name off that list.


753
00:54:15.452 --> 00:54:16.612
Nancy.

754
00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:20.517
- Nancy, where's David?
- Think he went for something to eat.


755
00:54:29.767 --> 00:54:32.201
- Have you seen my son?
- No, madam.


756
00:54:32.536 --> 00:54:34.834
He might be in the dining room.

757
00:54:34.905 --> 00:54:36.805
Dining room closed.

758
00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:43.310
I go look.

759
00:54:44.081 --> 00:54:45.412
Thank you.

760
00:54:52.523 --> 00:54:54.957
It's hardened steel.
It's going to vibrate a lot.


761
00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:59.018
Can't be helped. Anything is better
than going in the front door.


762
00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:02.931
- Want to give it a go?
- All right.


763
00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.831
- Okay, Alf, give it a go.
- Okay.


764
00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:20.608
Okay?

765
00:55:20.718 --> 00:55:22.049
Off we go.

766
00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:26.715
Make sure these adjusters are right flat
against the side of the drum. Okay?


767
00:55:26.824 --> 00:55:28.416
Very gently now.

768
00:55:32.196 --> 00:55:33.788
That's it. Okay.

769
00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:39.501
If you were Juggernaut, Charlie...

770
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.505
how would you prevent us from doing
what we're about to do?


771
00:55:42.573 --> 00:55:44.632
Install a trembler switch.

772
00:55:44.842 --> 00:55:46.901
One bit of vibration and up she'd go.

773
00:55:46.977 --> 00:55:48.774
Beaten before we start.

774
00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:50.905
The ship's engine would set it off.

775
00:55:50.981 --> 00:55:53.814
Not if he turned the switch coarse enough.

776
00:55:54.418 --> 00:55:56.147
That's it, Charlie.

777
00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.745
That's it, my boy. 
That's the catch.

778
00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:02.655
Now let's see how clever
this Juggernaut really is.


779
00:56:05.896 --> 00:56:08.990
Why don't you go and get sick, Charlie?
Come on.


780
00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:10.555
Come on.

781
00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:16.570
Good luck.

782
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:22.231
- Bridge.
- Navy's rig. Seal us off.


783
00:57:25.175 --> 00:57:26.836
- All clear.
- Okay.


784
00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.879
Closing 10.

785
00:57:34.218 --> 00:57:35.378
David!

786
00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:36.780
Come on!

787
00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:42.415
Closing 12.

788
00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:45.284
Come on. Christ!

789
00:57:46.864 --> 00:57:48.388
All sealed. Good luck.

790
00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:49.796
We're off.

791
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:52.460
- What are you doing down here?
- You're talking funny.


792
00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:54.401
Okay, Alf.

793
00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.170
Cutter on.

794
00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:02.673
Cooling liquid on!

795
00:58:14.258 --> 00:58:15.247
Bridge.

796
00:58:15.626 --> 00:58:18.390
Steward Azad.
We're shut in the kitchen corridor!


797
00:58:18.996 --> 00:58:20.623
They're cutting the bomb open!

798
00:58:20.698 --> 00:58:22.529
Christ! There's someone down there.

799
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.794
Open all doors.

800
00:58:34.345 --> 00:58:36.813
We are carrying explosives!

801
00:58:37.048 --> 00:58:38.208
Go on!

802
00:58:41.519 --> 00:58:42.486
Go on!

803
00:58:43.221 --> 00:58:45.018
Charlie, the emergency!

804
00:58:46.023 --> 00:58:47.422
Turn it off!

805
00:58:57.835 --> 00:59:00.770
You want to be more careful.
Nice cases, them.


806
00:59:18.022 --> 00:59:21.389
You've been retired four years,
Mr. Buckland.


807
00:59:21.526 --> 00:59:23.551
Is it four years already?

808
00:59:25.997 --> 00:59:28.989
Anyway, at the end,
they took me away from the action...


809
00:59:29.066 --> 00:59:31.296
and sat me at a drawing board.

810
00:59:32.637 --> 00:59:36.334
I was designing torpedoes.
I was never a drawing-board man.


811
00:59:36.507 --> 00:59:39.135
- Do you have a job now?
- No.


812
00:59:40.411 --> 00:59:42.311
I have a modest pension...

813
00:59:42.947 --> 00:59:45.040
for services to the nation.

814
00:59:46.551 --> 00:59:48.485
How have you spent today?

815
00:59:48.953 --> 00:59:51.854
Early-morning walk with the chap next door.

816
00:59:52.857 --> 00:59:55.587
This afternoon, gardening.

817
00:59:55.726 --> 00:59:59.287
I was in the garden with him.
Do I count as a witness?


818
01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:04.698
Excuse me.

819
01:00:05.837 --> 01:00:07.600
Was it some espionage job?

820
01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:09.998
Somebody gone over to the Russians?

821
01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:11.268
Something like that.

822
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.208
Any joy?

823
01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:19.639
No, he's clean, that one.

824
01:00:21.385 --> 01:00:24.377
We've checked all the explosive geniuses...

825
01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:27.288
all except two, who've gone missing.

826
01:00:27.592 --> 01:00:28.786
One of those two?

827
01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.350
Quiet, please.

828
01:00:31.095 --> 01:00:32.722
Rigoletto to you, cock.

829
01:00:33.965 --> 01:00:37.162
It could be those two.
It could be one of a dozen others.


830
01:00:37.535 --> 01:00:40.129
Just don't have time to check their alibis.

831
01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:42.669
We're going to lose, aren't we?

832
01:00:44.342 --> 01:00:47.743
Our two lousy suitcases.
That's the score, so far.


833
01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:00.045
Well?

834
01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.285
Two seamen,
a bomb-squad member drowned.


835
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.421
Another squad member
and a ship's steward killed in the explosion.


836
01:01:06.931 --> 01:01:10.992
Fallon's going to try
entering the device through the faceplate.


837
01:01:11.836 --> 01:01:13.201
That's all.

838
01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:16.231
So much for the Navy!

839
01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:18.531
Scotland Yard?

840
01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:21.903
You say you've got the £500,000 available.

841
01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:24.539
Yes, we made contingency plans.

842
01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:29.209
If I were you, I'd pay up.

843
01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.155
We've got the cases in the office.

844
01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:38.127
What, precisely, is Fallon attempting to do?

845
01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:42.257
He'll take up position
at one of the bombs, alone...


846
01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:43.695
and sealed off.

847
01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:47.629
His chief petty officer, Braddock,
will be at another drum, here.


848
01:01:47.705 --> 01:01:50.139
There'll be telephone communication
between them.


849
01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.437
Fallon will make the initial dissection.

850
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:55.604
Each successful step
will be passed to Braddock and duplicated.


851
01:01:55.947 --> 01:01:59.178
- Supposing Fallon's killed?
- Braddock will take over.


852
01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:02.144
He will diagnose the mistake,
carry on from there.


853
01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:04.153
Ad infinitum, I suppose.

854
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:07.850
Mr. Porter, a man made those bombs,
a man like us...


855
01:02:08.793 --> 01:02:10.192
like Fallon.

856
01:02:10.628 --> 01:02:12.653
It's purely a technical problem.

857
01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:16.966
I thought you were going to say
a technical "exercise."


858
01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:19.867
A chance to use your diplomatic expertise.

859
01:02:20.638 --> 01:02:23.072
People are dead!
Is that a technical problem?


860
01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.005
Shouting doesn't help.

861
01:02:26.077 --> 01:02:28.102
I know I must control myself...

862
01:02:28.179 --> 01:02:31.444
and not question government policy
in a loud voice.


863
01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:36.475
I must write to the families of the dead
asking them not to question the policy.


864
01:02:36.554 --> 01:02:40.217
This time tomorrow, 
I could be duplicating

865
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:44.284
to 1,200 families, asking them
not to question government policy!


866
01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:48.196
I'll pay the money.

867
01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:52.031
- I shall convey your remarks to the Minister.
- Yes! I can imagine!


868
01:02:52.103 --> 01:02:54.594
Delivered in beautiful, measured,
Whitehall prose!


869
01:02:54.672 --> 01:02:56.435
I can't predict the consequences.

870
01:02:56.507 --> 01:02:59.874
These are the consequences.
We're living through them!


871
01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:03.103
Tell him to stuff his subsidies.

872
01:03:07.618 --> 01:03:08.607
Good.

873
01:03:09.053 --> 01:03:11.248
I've just been blown
up by a bomb, Dad.

874
01:03:11.622 --> 01:03:13.055
In my pajamas.

875
01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:17.317
Yes, all right.

876
01:03:18.329 --> 01:03:20.229
Now you go back to bed.

877
01:03:21.098 --> 01:03:22.190
Okay?

878
01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:26.326
Good night.

879
01:03:34.445 --> 01:03:37.346
I think he made
the amatol in his bathtub.

880
01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.108
I still don't...

881
01:03:40.584 --> 01:03:41.915
- May I?
- Please.


882
01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:45.946
I'm sending for the money.

883
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.480
Good!

884
01:04:02.473 --> 01:04:04.270
Bridge, Captain here.

885
01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:06.399
Fallon, in position.

886
01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:08.243
Closing off.

887
01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:17.084
No balls-up this time.

888
01:04:17.188 --> 01:04:19.053
Closed until I say so.

889
01:04:20.024 --> 01:04:21.719
Or until my chief says so.

890
01:04:21.892 --> 01:04:24.019
- Understood?
- Understood.


891
01:04:24.095 --> 01:04:25.392
And, Captain...

892
01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:27.460
ask your driver to keep my room still.

893
01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:31.467
- All ahead, dead slow, both.
- All ahead, dead slow.


894
01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:48.416
- With me, Charlie.
- I'm with you, Skipper.


895
01:04:48.486 --> 01:04:49.919
You sound terrible.

896
01:04:49.987 --> 01:04:51.955
You were a bit
late with the dry toast.

897
01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:57.220
Looking at six slotted bolts.

898
01:04:58.162 --> 01:05:00.687
One top, one bottom, two either side.

899
01:05:00.765 --> 01:05:01.891
I'm looking.

900
01:05:01.966 --> 01:05:04.434
I think we'll start at the top.
It's good policy.


901
01:05:04.502 --> 01:05:06.595
That's what he wants us to think.

902
01:05:08.072 --> 01:05:09.096
Right.

903
01:05:09.974 --> 01:05:12.807
Let's try the bottom for choice.

904
01:05:13.978 --> 01:05:15.775
I wouldn't have their job for...

905
01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:18.713
At this moment I'd trade them even.

906
01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:22.442
The radio officer
said he was patching us to London.


907
01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.885
Anybody listening?

908
01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:28.414
This is the Overseas Service of the BBC.
Today, Princess Anne fell off her horse.


909
01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:32.428
Hello, Tony. This is Jeff Marder.
We'll be following along, okay?


910
01:05:32.797 --> 01:05:34.890
That's a great bloody help.

911
01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:38.426
Clear off the line, Jeff.
Give a man a bit of privacy.


912
01:05:39.236 --> 01:05:41.033
Don't wander too far.

913
01:05:42.006 --> 01:05:43.405
- Charlie.
- Skipper.


914
01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:46.967
Screwdriver is in the first slot.

915
01:05:48.646 --> 01:05:51.547
I'm going to work
my way around, clockwise.


916
01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:54.780
If there's a detonator behind any of them...

917
01:05:54.852 --> 01:05:57.787
I'll be suddenly shocked
by my own mortality.


918
01:06:02.026 --> 01:06:03.994
Still trying number one.

919
01:06:07.198 --> 01:06:08.563
It's tight.

920
01:06:09.433 --> 01:06:13.597
If at first you don't succeed,
don't make a bloody fool of yourself.


921
01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:19.672
Putting spanner on screwdriver.

922
01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:44.194
Can you still hear me breathing?

923
01:06:44.268 --> 01:06:46.327
I thought you were snoring.

924
01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.598
I'm supposed
to be the comedian of the group.


925
01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:50.537
Number one's loosened.

926
01:06:50.608 --> 01:06:51.700
Okay.

927
01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.670
Trying number one.

928
01:06:54.712 --> 01:06:57.146
Just loosen it. 
Don't take it out.

929
01:06:57.681 --> 01:06:59.012
No chance.

930
01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:07.847
Because the gang's all here

931
01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.540
Zing, boom, tararrel

932
01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:27.639
Ring out a song of good cheer

933
01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.672
Now's the time to roll the barrel

934
01:07:30.748 --> 01:07:31.737
All together!

935
01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:34.215
Because the gang's all here

936
01:07:38.022 --> 01:07:39.250
Waiter!

937
01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:43.416
Will you tell me the truth
if I ask you a question?


938
01:07:44.395 --> 01:07:47.296
Personal, business, or just plain silly?

939
01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:49.794
Personal.

940
01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:53.997
Have you ever been unfaithful to me?

941
01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:55.861
If I chose to lie...

942
01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:59.637
I could do so with remarkable dexterity.
You know that, don't you?


943
01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.107
Since we met...

944
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.578
yes.

945
01:08:13.057 --> 01:08:15.787
Since we have been married, no.

946
01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:18.191
And if we're going to die...

947
01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:20.590
I rejoice in the fact...

948
01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:24.025
that we're going to die together.

949
01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:30.167
Waiter!

950
01:08:49.159 --> 01:08:51.821
- Can we stay up late?
- As late as you like.


951
01:08:53.163 --> 01:08:54.152
Waiter!

952
01:08:55.733 --> 01:08:57.724
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

953
01:08:57.801 --> 01:09:01.635
Before the bandstand revolves to bring you
music for the younger dancers...


954
01:09:01.705 --> 01:09:05.106
one last dance from the orchestra,
a good-old good one...


955
01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:08.736
which I personally will demonstrate
at no extra charge.


956
01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:10.539
"The Lambeth Walk."

957
01:09:12.683 --> 01:09:14.241
Thank you, Professor.

958
01:09:41.045 --> 01:09:42.444
Sod them.

959
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:48.044
Waiter.

960
01:09:51.622 --> 01:09:54.250
Two double scotches in the same glass.

961
01:09:55.259 --> 01:09:56.419
Staff.

962
01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:58.857
- Lovely party.
- Amazing.


963
01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:03.190
Look, he's come as a dog.

964
01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:05.595
Cheers.

965
01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:08.261
Cheers.

966
01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:10.863
Should have been
playing the Palladium this week.


967
01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:12.340
I failed the written test.

968
01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:14.673
I think you're doing very well.

969
01:10:14.745 --> 01:10:16.576
Don't patronize me, darling.

970
01:10:18.315 --> 01:10:20.215
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.


971
01:10:21.285 --> 01:10:24.846
I joined as court jester
to smooth things out in times of crisis.


972
01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:28.322
Overlooked the fact
that I'd be just like all the others.


973
01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:30.058
Shit scared.

974
01:10:31.495 --> 01:10:33.725
Maybe all we want to do now...

975
01:10:34.932 --> 01:10:36.797
is to hold each other.

976
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.025
I'll give you an estimate.

977
01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:44.605
If these hairy youths
get their fuse wires sorted out...


978
01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:48.139
may I have a dance?

979
01:10:51.048 --> 01:10:53.243
I thought you'd never ask.

980
01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:29.105
Waiter!

981
01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.154
Civilization must be preserved.

982
01:12:44.094 --> 01:12:45.857
They're all dancing.

983
01:12:48.098 --> 01:12:50.794
- They don't know.
- Of course they know.


984
01:13:16.193 --> 01:13:19.287
- Number six is loose.
- Okay, I'm following, sir.


985
01:13:29.273 --> 01:13:31.833
Don't even know the man,
and he's trying to kill me.


986
01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.899
Haven't I told you about death?

987
01:13:34.144 --> 01:13:37.443
It's nature's way of saying
you're in the wrong job.


988
01:13:41.785 --> 01:13:44.777
Now let's see
what is hidden behind the bolts.


989
01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:53.860
Did I ever tell you
that you're a good man, Charlie Braddock?


990
01:13:54.231 --> 01:13:56.529
Not when you're sober, sir, no.

991
01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.729
- May you inherit the earth.
- Six feet of it, I should think.


992
01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:07.975
No springs.

993
01:14:09.046 --> 01:14:11.378
I'm going to take off the plate.

994
01:14:12.449 --> 01:14:13.939
I'm going to infrared.

995
01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:18.878
Looking for a light-activated trigger.

996
01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:33.830
- Still there, Charlie?
- Yes, Skipper.


997
01:14:42.346 --> 01:14:45.144
The light's off. 
Save the last dance for me.

998
01:14:47.818 --> 01:14:50.946
Here we all are, comfy in the dark.

999
01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:54.450
Starting to remove the bolts.

1000
01:14:55.292 --> 01:14:58.090
Bottom, going clockwise.

1001
01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.125
One.

1002
01:15:08.739 --> 01:15:11.173
Two. Easy.

1003
01:15:13.143 --> 01:15:14.337
Three.

1004
01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:19.948
I'm a little champion. Four.

1005
01:15:23.153 --> 01:15:24.177
Five.

1006
01:15:30.794 --> 01:15:34.389
There we are. Nice and easy.

1007
01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:36.990
Six.

1008
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:40.932
All right, Charlie.

1009
01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:44.067
This is it.

1010
01:15:45.342 --> 01:15:46.400
Be careful with the plate.

1011
01:15:54.151 --> 01:15:55.948
Doesn't want to move.

1012
01:16:12.169 --> 01:16:13.158
You okay?

1013
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.462
We should have been burglars.

1014
01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:18.330
We'd have made a fortune.

1015
01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:30.716
There's the little spider!

1016
01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:34.886
Photoelectric cell, upper left quadrant.

1017
01:16:35.325 --> 01:16:36.792
You're quite right.

1018
01:16:36.927 --> 01:16:39.521
The unfriendly bastard is trying to kill us.

1019
01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.443
Light going on, now.

1020
01:17:05.355 --> 01:17:09.792
First bit of white light strikes this,
and you'd be the new head prefect.


1021
01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:15.493
Complicated lash-up.

1022
01:17:18.201 --> 01:17:19.930
Something's moving.

1023
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:22.094
A sort of tape.

1024
01:17:26.376 --> 01:17:28.708
You're a clever man, Juggernaut.

1025
01:17:30.847 --> 01:17:31.973
Rightful contender.

1026
01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:36.816
Lower front section...

1027
01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:39.021
some kind of fuse panel.

1028
01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:42.180
Not nice, that.

1029
01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:46.190
Open invitation respectfully refused.

1030
01:17:50.867 --> 01:17:52.357
Off you go, Charlie.

1031
01:17:53.136 --> 01:17:54.467
Follow the yellow brick road.

1032
01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:57.499
Right. "In his master's steps he trod."

1033
01:17:58.642 --> 01:18:00.633
I'm going to the scanner.

1034
01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:04.073
Bottom first, right?

1035
01:18:20.497 --> 01:18:24.331
The first of the two normally closed relays,
according to my safe-ammeter...


1036
01:18:24.401 --> 01:18:27.302
there's no current in the top blue wire,
or the white.


1037
01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:30.863
Jeff here.

1038
01:18:30.941 --> 01:18:33.876
The relay on the left
is some sort of trigger mechanism.


1039
01:18:33.944 --> 01:18:37.209
On no account cut the red wire
before isolating the relay contacts.


1040
01:18:37.614 --> 01:18:40.981
I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.

1041
01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:51.092
Let's have a little look in here.

1042
01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:09.339
There's half a dozen triggers
hidden away in here.


1043
01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.874
All to be cut through
before we reach the timer.


1044
01:19:20.023 --> 01:19:22.514
Starting to cut. 
Follow me through, Charlie.

1045
01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:24.389
- Right side relays.
- I'm following.


1046
01:19:24.461 --> 01:19:25.723
Heads up!

1047
01:19:26.096 --> 01:19:29.293
Starting to cut the top blue wire now.

1048
01:19:31.635 --> 01:19:32.897
Top blue.

1049
01:19:36.473 --> 01:19:37.997
Now the white.

1050
01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:42.001
White.

1051
01:19:45.582 --> 01:19:46.571
Green.

1052
01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:53.277
Got it.

1053
01:19:53.823 --> 01:19:55.484
And the bottom blue.

1054
01:20:00.597 --> 01:20:01.928
Brilliantly analyzed.

1055
01:20:02.499 --> 01:20:05.161
Bottom blue. Got it.

1056
01:20:07.137 --> 01:20:09.970
Ready to isolate left side relay contacts.

1057
01:20:13.143 --> 01:20:15.236
Plastic strip should do it.

1058
01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:18.879
Slipping in between the contacts.

1059
01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:21.344
Downhill, this bit.

1060
01:20:27.757 --> 01:20:30.885
Captain, didn't you give my message
to your driver?


1061
01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:51.172
Charlie!

1062
01:20:51.247 --> 01:20:52.339
Station 8!

1063
01:20:52.415 --> 01:20:54.212
- Damage report.
- On its way, sir.


1064
01:20:54.284 --> 01:20:56.582
Damage Control Party, report to Station 8.

1065
01:20:56.653 --> 01:20:58.848
Sprinkler system's
activated in main ballroom.


1066
01:20:58.922 --> 01:21:01.857
- Taking water, sir!
- Watertight doors still closed.


1067
01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:04.153
Steady now.
Wounded on the starboard side.


1068
01:21:04.227 --> 01:21:06.457
Bring the seas to port. 
Come port to 0-8-0.

1069
01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:19.069
Tony, what's happened?

1070
01:21:20.410 --> 01:21:22.378
Charlie's bomb happened.

1071
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.745
Pay the man his money.

1072
01:21:45.135 --> 01:21:48.571
Flight Number 626 to Dusseldorf...

1073
01:21:49.172 --> 01:21:51.140
is departing from Gate 4.

1074
01:21:51.775 --> 01:21:55.711
Passengers who have not checked in,
please go to Desk O.


1075
01:21:57.714 --> 01:22:01.206
The coach for KLM Flight 102
to Rotterdam...


1076
01:22:01.684 --> 01:22:03.709
is departing from Gate 10.

1077
01:22:04.187 --> 01:22:07.122
Passengers who have not checked in
for this flight...


1078
01:22:07.190 --> 01:22:09.055
please go to Desk O.

1079
01:22:44.828 --> 01:22:48.696
British Airways Flight 568 to Zurich...

1080
01:22:49.065 --> 01:22:51.295
is departing from Gate 10.

1081
01:22:51.801 --> 01:22:54.269
Passengers who have not checked in...

1082
01:22:54.337 --> 01:22:55.827
please go to Desk O.

1083
01:22:55.905 --> 01:22:58.135
You'll need those for your luggage.

1084
01:22:58.208 --> 01:23:00.438
All right? Thank you very much.

1085
01:23:00.577 --> 01:23:01.635
Yes.

1086
01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:09.711
Just pop them down.
Thank you. Have you a ticket?


1087
01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:19.953
Thirty pounds overweight.
To Dublin, that's £14.50 to pay, sir.


1088
01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:23.223
What?

1089
01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:25.859
Excess baggage, £14.50 to pay.

1090
01:23:30.173 --> 01:23:33.370
- That's not in the script.
- No, something's wrong.


1091
01:23:41.784 --> 01:23:43.376
I'll have to...

1092
01:23:47.323 --> 01:23:49.291
I haven't got the money.

1093
01:23:53.396 --> 01:23:54.658
Get him!

1094
01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:19.845
Yes?

1095
01:24:19.923 --> 01:24:22.483
Nicholas Porter,
Managing Director of Sovereign Line?


1096
01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:24.253
You know bloody well it is.

1097
01:24:24.327 --> 01:24:28.991
Cancel all our previous arrangements,
Mr. Porter. Consider the matter closed.


1098
01:24:48.651 --> 01:24:50.380
Funny voice he has.

1099
01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.482
What about his face?
Did he have a funny face?


1100
01:24:53.556 --> 01:24:56.116
I haven't seen his face.
I never met the fella, have I?


1101
01:24:56.559 --> 01:24:58.584
Tell us about it, come on.

1102
01:24:58.861 --> 01:25:00.226
Rang me up.

1103
01:25:00.563 --> 01:25:04.226
Said he heard I might be interested in a job.
Dead simple.


1104
01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.129
Pick up some cases.

1105
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:08.637
Check them in at the counter.

1106
01:25:08.705 --> 01:25:10.434
£50 on account.

1107
01:25:10.506 --> 01:25:12.337
And £50 later.

1108
01:25:12.408 --> 01:25:14.433
No questions. Simple.

1109
01:25:15.912 --> 01:25:19.746
So I got the first £50 in an envelope,
through the door...


1110
01:25:21.384 --> 01:25:22.851
with a key...

1111
01:25:23.419 --> 01:25:24.886
instructions.

1112
01:25:26.122 --> 01:25:28.283
Then you know what happened.

1113
01:25:28.424 --> 01:25:30.392
It was a lash-up, wasn't it?

1114
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.020
Why didn't you take the £50 with you?

1115
01:25:33.162 --> 01:25:35.062
I'd spent it, hadn't I?

1116
01:25:47.577 --> 01:25:50.637
I blew a great big hole in your ship,
Captain.


1117
01:25:52.382 --> 01:25:54.577
I better give it back to you.

1118
01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:56.545
Drink?

1119
01:25:57.987 --> 01:25:59.648
There's a message.

1120
01:26:07.296 --> 01:26:09.491
How much did the man ask for?

1121
01:26:10.133 --> 01:26:11.657
£500,000?

1122
01:26:12.568 --> 01:26:13.796
Give it to him.

1123
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:15.667
He's not even greedy.

1124
01:26:15.838 --> 01:26:18.238
£500,000 for your fine ship?

1125
01:26:18.307 --> 01:26:19.399
Read that.

1126
01:26:19.475 --> 01:26:22.137
You couldn't even buy a decent trawler
at that price.


1127
01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:24.111
Read that, Mr. Fallon.

1128
01:26:28.284 --> 01:26:30.650
"Negotiations have broken down."

1129
01:26:32.021 --> 01:26:35.457
There's only one answer
for that sort of mentality.


1130
01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:39.259
You have to go back to the bombs.

1131
01:26:40.763 --> 01:26:42.162
Persuade me.

1132
01:26:42.398 --> 01:26:44.195
1,200 lives.

1133
01:26:45.868 --> 01:26:47.028
Lives?

1134
01:26:49.005 --> 01:26:50.870
Not many lives, that.

1135
01:26:50.973 --> 01:26:53.703
I mean, not in
the great scheme of things.

1136
01:26:53.776 --> 01:26:56.108
Remember what the goldfish said?

1137
01:26:57.213 --> 01:26:58.737
"There must be a God!

1138
01:26:58.815 --> 01:27:01.045
"I mean, who changes the water?"

1139
01:27:03.019 --> 01:27:05.351
Specks in the universe, Captain.

1140
01:27:05.621 --> 01:27:07.486
Launch your lifeboats.

1141
01:27:08.591 --> 01:27:10.650
You've seen the conditions out there.

1142
01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:13.251
If we launch the lifeboats,
half of them won't survive.


1143
01:27:13.329 --> 01:27:16.526
The thoughts of death
do not impress me, Captain.


1144
01:27:17.233 --> 01:27:20.430
I've thought of nothing else
all my working life!


1145
01:27:22.138 --> 01:27:24.470
My trade is survival!

1146
01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:27.775
Get through the next 24 hours!

1147
01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:31.675
All right, I know...

1148
01:27:34.317 --> 01:27:36.342
other people do it, too...

1149
01:27:36.519 --> 01:27:40.455
but I suffer from it
in a more extreme form.

1150
01:27:42.425 --> 01:27:45.155
Fallon, stop drinking. 
I'm ordering you.

1151
01:27:49.499 --> 01:27:51.558
You don't give the orders.

1152
01:27:52.168 --> 01:27:55.035
That good and gifted man
who planted the bombs...


1153
01:27:55.104 --> 01:27:56.731
gives the orders.

1154
01:28:05.448 --> 01:28:07.882
Charlie was a good and gifted man.

1155
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:22.657
Sometimes it...

1156
01:28:23.566 --> 01:28:25.090
Sometimes it...

1157
01:28:25.868 --> 01:28:27.096
happens.

1158
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:29.838
Just like that, Captain.

1159
01:28:35.511 --> 01:28:37.411
The tea break is over.

1160
01:28:47.857 --> 01:28:50.485
You can generally see where I've been.

1161
01:28:52.662 --> 01:28:54.892
All right, lads, back to work.

1162
01:28:56.032 --> 01:28:57.397
One apiece.

1163
01:28:59.035 --> 01:29:01.230
- The sorcerer's apprentice.
- Yes, sir.


1164
01:29:01.304 --> 01:29:05.035
You've got a chance
to make a name for yourself, posthumously.


1165
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:17.685
All right, how far did Charlie go?
What was his last move?


1166
01:29:19.055 --> 01:29:20.579
Relay contacts.

1167
01:29:23.292 --> 01:29:25.988
Inserting a strip of plastic between...

1168
01:29:26.462 --> 01:29:28.191
the relay contacts.

1169
01:29:50.353 --> 01:29:51.547
Jesus.

1170
01:29:53.322 --> 01:29:54.846
There's a wire.

1171
01:29:56.058 --> 01:29:57.548
Just a thread.

1172
01:29:58.661 --> 01:30:00.185
I can hardly see it.

1173
01:30:01.664 --> 01:30:04.224
The contacts are electrically closed.

1174
01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.165
Charlie's strip must have broken the wire.

1175
01:30:06.736 --> 01:30:09.637
- What's your next procedure?
- Shut up, Jeff!


1176
01:30:11.307 --> 01:30:14.105
Clamping the contacts. 
It's very delicate.

1177
01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:16.368
I want silence.

1178
01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.151
Don't go too far, Jeff.

1179
01:30:28.691 --> 01:30:30.090
Here we are.

1180
01:31:08.097 --> 01:31:10.998
We're doing useful work after all, Charlie.

1181
01:31:11.634 --> 01:31:15.229
What's the point of being afraid?
We've lived on borrowed time long enough.


1182
01:31:25.047 --> 01:31:26.674
Come on.

1183
01:31:28.484 --> 01:31:30.008
That's the boy.

1184
01:31:33.556 --> 01:31:34.614
Now.

1185
01:31:37.693 --> 01:31:39.558
Observe the control...

1186
01:31:40.663 --> 01:31:42.221
and the restraint.

1187
01:31:43.099 --> 01:31:45.363
You're a good man, Juggernaut.

1188
01:31:48.871 --> 01:31:50.338
But so am I.

1189
01:31:51.374 --> 01:31:52.841
So is Fallon.

1190
01:31:56.846 --> 01:31:58.245
A good man.

1191
01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:32.840
Lighting up.

1192
01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:43.815
There's some kind plate at the back.

1193
01:32:45.327 --> 01:32:47.192
A moving tape counter.

1194
01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:49.893
I'm going to cut it.

1195
01:32:50.699 --> 01:32:54.260
I'm sorry, Tony, Jeff again.
How's the counter connected?


1196
01:32:54.737 --> 01:32:57.205
Connected to sweet bloody nothing!

1197
01:32:57.606 --> 01:32:59.198
Icing on a cake.

1198
01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:01.269
Well...

1199
01:33:01.544 --> 01:33:04.479
it's getting early. 
Time Fallon was asleep.

1200
01:33:06.182 --> 01:33:08.116
Cutting now.

1201
01:33:17.927 --> 01:33:19.861
He's a bloody comedian!

1202
01:33:20.029 --> 01:33:21.758
Everybody laughing?

1203
01:33:22.198 --> 01:33:24.928
The bells of hell go tring-a-ling-a-ling

1204
01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.546
Removing the mounting plate.
Should find the timing device behind it.


1205
01:33:42.785 --> 01:33:45.151
Watch when you remove the mounting clips.

1206
01:33:45.221 --> 01:33:46.654
Don't worry.

1207
01:33:46.856 --> 01:33:49.120
I'm getting used to his style.

1208
01:33:53.929 --> 01:33:55.521
First one loose.

1209
01:33:55.998 --> 01:33:58.796
There's something about his brush strokes.

1210
01:34:00.169 --> 01:34:01.898
Finding the second.

1211
01:34:02.538 --> 01:34:04.802
And his tone of voice.

1212
01:34:05.908 --> 01:34:07.307
Here we go now.

1213
01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:09.609
Second free.

1214
01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:11.476
Now...

1215
01:34:12.715 --> 01:34:14.808
I'm lowering the circuit board.

1216
01:34:27.296 --> 01:34:29.526
Back to square one, gentlemen.

1217
01:34:29.732 --> 01:34:32.360
Another booby-trap and I'm the booby.

1218
01:34:32.968 --> 01:34:34.128
Bridge!

1219
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:36.065
I want paint remover. 
Gallons of it.

1220
01:34:36.639 --> 01:34:39.437
And I want it
fast, to every bomb station.

1221
01:34:40.643 --> 01:34:42.508
Clear the engine room.

1222
01:34:52.755 --> 01:34:55.383
- Malicent.
- Finish with the engines...


1223
01:34:56.225 --> 01:34:57.249
quick as you can.

1224
01:34:57.326 --> 01:34:58.691
Understood.

1225
01:35:02.731 --> 01:35:04.255
Good luck, sir.

1226
01:35:18.414 --> 01:35:19.540
Jeff...

1227
01:35:19.648 --> 01:35:23.550
or anyone listening in London,
I've seen this same hilarious trick before.


1228
01:35:24.186 --> 01:35:26.450
Only once, during the Blitz.

1229
01:35:27.756 --> 01:35:29.348
German land mine.

1230
01:35:30.826 --> 01:35:32.794
The real entrance is around the side.

1231
01:35:32.861 --> 01:35:35.796
Go in the front door,
there's a rude message.


1232
01:35:39.935 --> 01:35:43.166
Now, whoever built the German bomb
built this one.


1233
01:35:45.174 --> 01:35:48.837
Superintendent McCleod, police.
Juggernaut's voice was English.


1234
01:35:49.311 --> 01:35:51.302
I don't care if
it was the Queen Mum.

1235
01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:53.575
Whoever built the German horror
built this one.


1236
01:35:53.682 --> 01:35:56.116
How do we check? 
How do we find out?

1237
01:35:57.186 --> 01:35:59.586
I was working with Sid Buckland.

1238
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:01.850
I was on his team.

1239
01:36:02.424 --> 01:36:05.154
Go see Sid,
and tell him that young Fallon...


1240
01:36:05.594 --> 01:36:07.687
is in the fertilizer again.

1241
01:36:12.835 --> 01:36:14.769
I remember it very well.

1242
01:36:14.837 --> 01:36:16.862
Brilliant piece of design.

1243
01:36:17.406 --> 01:36:20.204
We sought out the designer after the war.

1244
01:36:20.976 --> 01:36:22.466
Werner Sterne...

1245
01:36:23.245 --> 01:36:25.110
electrical engineer...

1246
01:36:25.414 --> 01:36:26.745
Frankfurt.

1247
01:36:28.050 --> 01:36:32.180
I regret to inform you
that Mr. Sterne died in Munich 11 years ago.


1248
01:36:33.522 --> 01:36:34.819
Found this upstairs.

1249
01:36:55.944 --> 01:36:57.138
Bingo!

1250
01:36:57.813 --> 01:36:59.804
Different sort of metal.

1251
01:37:07.423 --> 01:37:09.550
It'll cut. High-speed drill.

1252
01:37:10.059 --> 01:37:13.256
- Won't it set off the trembler fuse?
- It's a coarse trembler.


1253
01:37:13.328 --> 01:37:14.693
Fine drill.

1254
01:37:16.465 --> 01:37:18.831
If it was easy,
everybody would be doing it.

1255
01:37:18.901 --> 01:37:21.301
And then what would become of us?

1256
01:37:21.737 --> 01:37:22.829
Off you go, Digby.

1257
01:37:23.639 --> 01:37:27.040
I'll see you when I've discovered
the secret of the universe.


1258
01:37:35.417 --> 01:37:39.979
Tony, your German designer's dead,
but they've found Juggernaut. Buckland.


1259
01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:46.827
- I've got to get on with this.
- Just before you go.


1260
01:37:46.895 --> 01:37:48.920
That trick land mine, how was it fused?

1261
01:37:50.432 --> 01:37:53.424
We never found out. 
Ran like thieves.

1262
01:37:54.536 --> 01:37:57.334
Blew up three blocks.
The blast broke my leg.


1263
01:37:57.406 --> 01:38:00.637
Everything was burning.
Buckland dragged me out.


1264
01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:04.038
Starting to drill.

1265
01:38:21.797 --> 01:38:23.355
Are we winning?

1266
01:38:24.066 --> 01:38:25.658
Two hours to go.

1267
01:38:26.168 --> 01:38:29.262
They still haven't reached
the fusing mechanism.


1268
01:38:29.605 --> 01:38:30.936
Two hours.

1269
01:38:36.211 --> 01:38:37.735
Fingers move.

1270
01:38:38.614 --> 01:38:40.138
"Move," I say...

1271
01:38:40.649 --> 01:38:42.139
and they move.

1272
01:38:42.651 --> 01:38:45.415
I give the order "smile," and I do.

1273
01:38:54.596 --> 01:38:56.461
I shall miss all that.

1274
01:38:57.199 --> 01:39:00.794
- What's this thing he can't reach?
- The fusing mechanism.


1275
01:39:01.737 --> 01:39:03.534
The secret of it all?

1276
01:39:04.239 --> 01:39:05.501
Yes.

1277
01:39:05.841 --> 01:39:08.139
Two hours to reach
your fusing mechanism...


1278
01:39:08.210 --> 01:39:11.839
and you must get on
with your master's business.


1279
01:39:11.914 --> 01:39:14.974
If it's any consolation, 
Fallon tells me...

1280
01:39:16.018 --> 01:39:18.509
that 1,200 deaths don't matter.

1281
01:39:19.121 --> 01:39:22.022
A speck of dust in
the eye of the universe.

1282
01:39:22.524 --> 01:39:24.549
Something about goldfish.

1283
01:39:24.793 --> 01:39:28.285
1,000, 1,200, 1,400, 
I'm with him there.

1284
01:39:29.231 --> 01:39:30.562
But one...

1285
01:39:30.766 --> 01:39:33.326
you can care about one person, Alex.

1286
01:39:34.436 --> 01:39:36.097
Is there someone?

1287
01:39:36.839 --> 01:39:37.897
Yes.

1288
01:39:40.475 --> 01:39:41.942
And is it me?

1289
01:39:47.249 --> 01:39:48.739
You're wanted.

1290
01:40:01.763 --> 01:40:04.732
Fallon's found the fuse.
He's afraid the bomb's going to blow.


1291
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:08.099
- All passengers stand by lifeboats.
- Lifeboats, sir.


1292
01:40:17.779 --> 01:40:20.771
There are two wires
from the top of the detonator.


1293
01:40:20.849 --> 01:40:22.373
One red, one blue.

1294
01:40:23.051 --> 01:40:25.019
One fires the detonator.

1295
01:40:25.687 --> 01:40:27.416
Thus the big bang.

1296
01:40:29.157 --> 01:40:32.490
I'm afraid I don't know
what the other one does.


1297
01:41:14.236 --> 01:41:15.828
Trembler switch.

1298
01:41:17.172 --> 01:41:18.332
I'm putting it back.

1299
01:41:20.142 --> 01:41:21.404
Easy, Fallon.

1300
01:41:43.165 --> 01:41:44.154
Get me Buckland.

1301
01:42:07.255 --> 01:42:09.348
I think you better put this on, sir.

1302
01:42:09.424 --> 01:42:12.120
- I can't swim!
- That's why you're wearing it.


1303
01:42:12.194 --> 01:42:15.527
The ships out there'll have you
before you get your feet wet.


1304
01:42:16.498 --> 01:42:17.692
- Officer.
- Yes, sir?


1305
01:42:17.766 --> 01:42:19.893
I've just been bitten again.

1306
01:42:22.337 --> 01:42:24.362
Will the sea be very cold?

1307
01:42:25.941 --> 01:42:28.136
In my professional opinion...

1308
01:42:28.977 --> 01:42:30.205
not hot.

1309
01:42:30.912 --> 01:42:33.005
And it will ruin your hair.

1310
01:42:33.515 --> 01:42:37.679
In your professional capacity,
you're supposed to be cheering us up.


1311
01:42:39.321 --> 01:42:41.380
There aren't any icebergs.

1312
01:42:42.457 --> 01:42:43.481
Correction.

1313
01:42:46.461 --> 01:42:48.793
Fallon, this is London Control.

1314
01:42:50.432 --> 01:42:52.992
- Tony, this is Jeff speaking.
- Where's Buckland?


1315
01:42:53.135 --> 01:42:56.002
He's with the police.
He doesn't want to talk about the bombs.


1316
01:42:56.071 --> 01:42:57.231
I want Buckland.

1317
01:42:58.573 --> 01:43:02.407
The time is 6:01. 
The mission is terminated.

1318
01:43:02.477 --> 01:43:05.037
Like hell it is. 
I know how he's done it.

1319
01:43:05.113 --> 01:43:07.343
It's just one small step. 
I'm nearly there.

1320
01:43:07.416 --> 01:43:10.249
It's 6:02. Take your men above decks.

1321
01:43:10.318 --> 01:43:13.412
My men will stay on till they've done
what they came aboard to do.


1322
01:43:13.622 --> 01:43:16.022
Now stop pissing about
and get me Buckland!


1323
01:43:20.295 --> 01:43:21.387
Why?

1324
01:43:21.897 --> 01:43:26.163
I can't explain what they did to me,
not in official police jargon, that is.


1325
01:43:26.234 --> 01:43:29.601
- Who are they?
- They teach you how to dismantle bombs...


1326
01:43:29.671 --> 01:43:31.070
save lives.

1327
01:43:31.373 --> 01:43:35.605
But they didn't pay you enough,
so you learn how to design bombs.


1328
01:43:35.944 --> 01:43:38.469
Taking lives, that pays much better.

1329
01:43:39.047 --> 01:43:43.177
And then one day you're old,
and they give you a miserable pension.


1330
01:43:47.255 --> 01:43:48.984
I'm still good at my job.

1331
01:43:49.357 --> 01:43:53.054
Fallon refuses to leave.
He insists on talking to Buckland.


1332
01:43:57.566 --> 01:43:59.329
I'll talk to Fallon.

1333
01:44:01.703 --> 01:44:05.070
And you think we should give way
to people like that?


1334
01:44:05.207 --> 01:44:07.232
You make people like that.

1335
01:44:15.817 --> 01:44:18.251
It's all right, 
Tony, he's coming.

1336
01:44:20.355 --> 01:44:21.720
Hello, Sid.

1337
01:44:22.357 --> 01:44:24.120
This is Tony Fallon.

1338
01:44:24.659 --> 01:44:27.492
If we're still on speaking terms, that is.

1339
01:44:27.629 --> 01:44:30.723
I'd like to apologize right here and now...

1340
01:44:31.199 --> 01:44:32.996
for whatever it is I did.

1341
01:44:34.903 --> 01:44:36.097
Buckland.

1342
01:44:36.171 --> 01:44:37.934
It's a joyous noise.

1343
01:44:38.306 --> 01:44:40.399
I'm sorry it's you, Fallon.

1344
01:44:40.575 --> 01:44:42.668
I'm sorry it's me, as well.

1345
01:44:42.744 --> 01:44:45.212
I thought you'd taught me
everything I knew, Sid.


1346
01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.975
But there's a missing link...

1347
01:44:47.048 --> 01:44:49.312
that's making me a little nervous.

1348
01:44:49.384 --> 01:44:51.944
I know you remember being nervous.

1349
01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.254
Bear with me, Sid.

1350
01:44:54.489 --> 01:44:57.014
There's a red wire, and a blue wire.

1351
01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:00.390
One trips off the detonator.

1352
01:45:00.829 --> 01:45:03.491
The other is a
booby trap, the sucker punch.

1353
01:45:04.399 --> 01:45:07.368
Now that's perfectly diagnosed,
wouldn't you say?


1354
01:45:07.435 --> 01:45:08.697
Perfect.

1355
01:45:09.304 --> 01:45:11.101
Time's pressing, Sid.

1356
01:45:12.207 --> 01:45:14.505
I think in about three minutes.

1357
01:45:17.345 --> 01:45:19.677
I'm going to cut the blue wire.

1358
01:45:20.815 --> 01:45:22.476
My lads will wait.

1359
01:45:23.151 --> 01:45:25.244
If I go in the wrong way...

1360
01:45:25.487 --> 01:45:27.455
they'll know what to do.

1361
01:45:28.690 --> 01:45:30.055
Am I right?

1362
01:45:32.327 --> 01:45:35.194
Is it the blue wire, Sid?

1363
01:45:39.501 --> 01:45:40.900
Two minutes.

1364
01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:43.629
Sid, it's too late to run.

1365
01:45:44.039 --> 01:45:45.233
And furthermore...

1366
01:45:45.307 --> 01:45:48.572
I freely acknowledge
that you are still the governor.


1367
01:45:50.011 --> 01:45:51.876
And one other point...

1368
01:45:54.549 --> 01:45:56.346
I'm very frightened.

1369
01:45:56.985 --> 01:46:00.352
And I know you remember, precisely,
what I'm feeling.


1370
01:46:03.191 --> 01:46:04.920
All for the sake...

1371
01:46:05.827 --> 01:46:07.260
of one word, Sid.

1372
01:46:07.929 --> 01:46:08.953
"Red"...

1373
01:46:09.931 --> 01:46:11.193
or "blue."

1374
01:46:15.103 --> 01:46:16.798
Cut the blue wire.

1375
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:37.057
Cut the blue wire.

1376
01:46:58.813 --> 01:46:59.802
Red, lads!

1377
01:47:00.882 --> 01:47:03.646
Cut the red. R
-E
-D, red!

1378
01:47:21.303 --> 01:47:23.237
Fallon is the champion.

1379
01:47:39.788 --> 01:47:41.221
I didn't know what to do.

1380
01:47:41.289 --> 01:47:43.621
I'll take you down
and get you a drink.

1381
01:47:43.692 --> 01:47:46.217
What, at 6:00 in the morning?

1382
01:48:05.413 --> 01:48:07.608
- You want one?
- Thanks very much.
