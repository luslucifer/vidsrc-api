I am okay.

00:02:39.037 --> 00:02:40.994
Can you times
keep it short? - Clear.


7
00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.065
Hi! Are you Johnny? 
- Yes.

8
00:02:45.085 --> 00:02:47.702
Congratulations
to your profit. - Thank you.


9
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.677
Charlie, where are you then?

10
00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:12.568
Hello?

11
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.347
Cool hut. - Because I can
get used to it. - Yes, is not bad.


12
00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:19.154
Krasser shit.
- Not bad?


13
00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:22.811
Sorry, folks,
have probably eaten something bad.


14
00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:27.065
Have you in the car actually in the pocket
puked or could you's keep in stomach?

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:29.484
www.zvi.com, okay?

16
00:03:29.504 --> 00:03:32.571
Sorry?
- Well, too much information.


17
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:35.675
Speaking of information.
I know why I'm here, but ...


18
00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:39.160
You guys can not yet
all have won.


19
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.263
What's coming then
here at this rally?


20
00:03:44.144 --> 00:03:46.710
Can I get a bit
Ask attention?


21
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.097
I believe,
I can answer all your questions.


22
00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.187
First of all:
Welcome.


23
00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.051
Hi! - Hi!
- On behalf of Winfree,


24
00:03:55.071 --> 00:03:59.264
the brand new download service
for cutting-edge, international films.


25
00:03:59.284 --> 00:04:02.277
My name is Maureen.
I'm the housekeeper.


26
00:04:02.913 --> 00:04:06.897
You've already seen me in the clip,
in which the winners have been notified.


27
00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:09.625
First, I say to each
of you briefly what. Charles ...


28
00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:13.921
You are interested in
Technology and Computer.


29
00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.780
A little.

30
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.116
Okay.
And Johnny, you are very athletic.


31
00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:19.326
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:22.078
Vincent, a medical student, right?
- Correct.


33
00:04:22.098 --> 00:04:26.249
Toll! Lola, you know by now, if you
want to make your Master? - Not yet.


34
00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:28.877
Maggie,
how's your clothing line?


35
00:04:28.897 --> 00:04:31.630
Fantastic.
Would you like safely.


36
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.382
And Jenna, I am pleased,
that you care for a few days


37
00:04:34.402 --> 00:04:36.051
from your teacher
free might.


38
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:39.387
Now, you see, we have
a little research operated.


39
00:04:39.407 --> 00:04:42.891
As a precondition to you
to invite in the Beach House.


40
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:46.686
My job is, you stay
to make as pleasant as possible.


41
00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:50.899
As the winner of all your costs are covered
and you have the whole house.


42
00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.443
You can watch freely
the refrigerator and the bar operate.


43
00:04:53.463 --> 00:04:57.030
Also you have access to the pool,
the barbecue, all sports equipment


44
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.451
and one of the most beautiful private beaches,
has to offer to our country.


45
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:03.244
For a whole week.

46
00:05:03.264 --> 00:05:07.624
Two rules. First:
This is really for each of you.


47
00:05:07.644 --> 00:05:11.854
If one of you home earlier
want to go, then you must all go.


48
00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:14.047
Secondly:

49
00:05:14.067 --> 00:05:16.559
Nobody goes into the sea
after nightfall.


50
00:05:17.237 --> 00:05:20.856
Well then, if you still
have any questions, ask me.


51
00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:25.809
Everything, what you should know about the beach,
Joe tells you, the lifeguard.


52
00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:30.039
You can find him from sunrise to
Sunset in his station on the beach.


53
00:05:35.672 --> 00:05:38.071
So much for the rules.
Do you still have any questions?


54
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:41.050
Well, the allocation of rooms
depends on the bulletin board.


55
00:05:41.511 --> 00:05:45.078
All right. - I would say,
we bring our luggage to the room


56
00:05:45.098 --> 00:05:48.999
and head to the bar,
as long as the hot tub heats. And off!


57
00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:51.306
Since I'm in.
- I've heard bar?


58
00:05:51.896 --> 00:05:55.856
That's what I call "très chique".
Here's can withstand up. - Wow!


59
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.393
So, unfortunately, I still do not know,
which bikini to wear.


60
00:06:08.413 --> 00:06:10.729
If you have multiple doing?
- Yes it is.


61
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:13.440
I like the purple.
- To me or to you?


62
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.109
Really?
- Yes, I have designed.


63
00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.280
These are all sample parts.
And that's perfect now, to try them.


64
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.366
Yes. - Your steamer trunk
is still around in the way.


65
00:06:23.386 --> 00:06:25.285
Oh ...
Yes, I imagine it away later.


66
00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:28.371
Age, look,
This is the bedroom of the women.


67
00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:30.929
What?
- You can see everything in detail.


68
00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:33.710
Charlie, you're
really a tensioner, man.


69
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.129
It forces you no mitzugucken.

70
00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:39.632
So I want. - Me too.
But Depends which undresses.


71
00:06:39.652 --> 00:06:43.396
So, ladies, come on,
always nice to get out of the clothes.


72
00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:47.849
Now making a
after another naked.


73
00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:50.060
Very beautiful.
There you are. Keep it up.


74
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.164
Wait.
Before you go forth what, wait. - Why?


75
00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:56.357
Perhaps here,
just like in these reality shows,


76
00:06:56.377 --> 00:06:58.460
any hidden cameras.

77
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.781
I have in this computer freak
a really strange feeling.


78
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:04.699
I do not trust.
- There is something on that.


79
00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:07.869
The was also a long time
in the house in front of us. - Precisely. - And ...


80
00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:11.998
I do not know how you stand to
but I do not let me film determined.


81
00:07:12.018 --> 00:07:14.055
I have an app
on my phone.


82
00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.630
The automatically recognizes the frequencies
by all camera models. - Really?


83
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.924
Yes, if there are cameras here
we notice that.


84
00:07:20.944 --> 00:07:23.176
What are they doing there?
- Who cares?


85
00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:24.562
But wait a minute ...

86
00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:26.943
What was that?

87
00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:31.184
There is a camera.
Certainly. - Really?


88
00:07:31.204 --> 00:07:33.686
Okay.
- And she's turned on at the moment.


89
00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:35.663
These perverts
Watch us straight.


90
00:07:39.087 --> 00:07:40.999
These Lola-brat is really hot.

91
00:07:41.464 --> 00:07:44.114
But if we report,
might send us home all.


92
00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:47.002
No. It's out of the question.
We're barely here. - Okay.


93
00:07:47.262 --> 00:07:50.995
We have a plan and only,
then to avenge us. - Okay.


94
00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:53.331
Sounds great.
You know what?


95
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:56.000
If the want to clamp,
we will give them what to tension.


96
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.979
The will
still surprised. Music, please. - Okay.


97
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.020
Wow, cool thing.
Maggie, what a show.


98
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.731
Are they in reality strippers?
- No idea.


99
00:08:18.751 --> 00:08:22.620
Just as moving are the
perhaps supermodels or so.


100
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:26.499
Real juicy and plump.
Guys, this is indeed so hot here.


101
00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:32.346
The thinking determines
we would always do.


102
00:08:36.352 --> 00:08:40.312
Take off you. But not give them
the full program. That they do not get.


103
00:08:44.903 --> 00:08:48.442
Real beautiful mares.
- Yes man. Krass.


104
00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:50.406
Damn it.

105
00:08:53.912 --> 00:08:55.476
Hey, Hypno
-Boy.

106
00:08:55.496 --> 00:08:57.770
Are you on reception?
Earth to Vincent.


107
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.272
Total kicked off.

108
00:08:59.292 --> 00:09:03.610
Only that it's you know, not a bad word
about Jenna. Otherwise I'm going to kill you.


109
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.997
No, whence?
I am focussing more on Maggie.


110
00:09:16.184 --> 00:09:19.042
No, ah northeast.
- What's going on at once?


111
00:09:19.062 --> 00:09:20.835
Is only just
become interesting.


112
00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:21.811
Well, sorry, guys.

113
00:09:24.984 --> 00:09:29.302
They strapped that we sit and watch.
- Vincent, excellently observed.


114
00:09:29.322 --> 00:09:32.388
The finger I had
almost overlooked. - That's not good.


115
00:09:32.408 --> 00:09:35.892
Gentlemen, not good. - At least
I can rewind the recording


116
00:09:35.912 --> 00:09:37.894
and all over again
run from the front.


117
00:09:37.914 --> 00:09:40.452
But then you do not want
be in the room, because ...


118
00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:44.359
But if you want, then remain.
- No I do not want this.


119
00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:45.693
A second hand
can I always need.


120
00:09:45.713 --> 00:09:47.528
I am happy,
if I may leave the room.


121
00:09:47.548 --> 00:09:50.114
I plan an interesting technique.
- We'll just go out.


122
00:09:50.134 --> 00:09:52.751
We will treat your privacy.
- Scratch you a calm.


123
00:10:38.683 --> 00:10:40.299
The makes me crazy.

124
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.809
Which one?
- Maggie, the brunette.


125
00:10:46.941 --> 00:10:48.464
The area is hot.

126
00:10:48.484 --> 00:10:51.634
But actually, I have to say,
all of which are of the finest quality.


127
00:10:51.654 --> 00:10:54.442
This is really frustrating.
I'm just air for them.


128
00:10:55.616 --> 00:10:57.778
Then you must
not change what, kid.


129
00:10:58.828 --> 00:11:03.062
Man, do not misunderstand. But I
take of an old lifeguard


130
00:11:03.082 --> 00:11:06.450
but no advice
in matters of love. - Very friendly.


131
00:11:07.295 --> 00:11:09.944
Then I'll times
verklickern two things. First:


132
00:11:09.964 --> 00:11:12.196
I have a trunk
like a baby elephant.


133
00:11:12.216 --> 00:11:15.004
Hello, My Big,
you have plenty of room in there?


134
00:11:15.762 --> 00:11:20.330
Second: The talk about
that it would not arrive on the size,


135
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.499
is a huge bullshit.
Can you fully depreciate.


136
00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:26.419
Look at me. You have to admit,
I look damn good.


137
00:11:26.439 --> 00:11:29.088
Am well built,
Class complexion and so on.


138
00:11:29.108 --> 00:11:31.341
I have in my
Lifeguard house just wait


139
00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:33.259
they come to me automatically.

140
00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:37.847
I also add very much that I
have already saved many relationships.


141
00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:42.769
If I'm not even in it over there,
Then I push myself as a marriage counselor.


142
00:11:42.789 --> 00:11:47.190
Dr. Joe, the lifeguard,
Slash marriage counselor, at your service.


143
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.027
You kidding me yet. - With what?
So that I am a marriage counselor? - No.


144
00:11:51.047 --> 00:11:55.323
But I just do not think you
the women fly on its own, man.


145
00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:58.576
I swear that's true.
No shit, buddy.


146
00:11:58.596 --> 00:12:02.121
But if I am to be honest,
it is not enough that you want them.


147
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:04.040
You must namely
want to have you.


148
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.959
And how do I do that?
Tell me that. - Okay.


149
00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:09.337
Then listen well.
I'll tell you this only once.


150
00:12:09.357 --> 00:12:11.839
Go down to the harbor
Get a candle.


151
00:12:11.859 --> 00:12:15.551
And so you stand easy
tonight at her bedroom window.


152
00:12:15.571 --> 00:12:17.428
But do not get too close, get it?

153
00:12:17.448 --> 00:12:21.641
Perhaps she finds it but shit.
Are you really sure?


154
00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:25.228
I tell you, stand at the window, okay?
With your candle.


155
00:12:25.248 --> 00:12:29.538
Unselfish you keep vigil.
In any weather.


156
00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:40.044
Wow! 
- Cool.

157
00:12:51.357 --> 00:12:52.473
The Hammer.

158
00:13:03.453 --> 00:13:05.319
All right.
Shall We Dance?


159
00:13:15.214 --> 00:13:17.171
Do not be shy.

160
00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:26.927
Good night, ladies.

161
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:28.637
Good night.

162
00:13:30.813 --> 00:13:32.930
What was that?
- A seal or so.


163
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.067
Well, do I sign out.

164
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:46.058
So, we'll see you tomorrow morning.
Good night, ladies.


165
00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:48.035
Good night.
- What about your jacket?


166
00:13:48.498 --> 00:13:52.458
Keep them. It reflects.
So I recognize you in the dark.


167
00:14:11.145 --> 00:14:14.183
May I keep you company?
- Sure, come on in.


168
00:14:15.399 --> 00:14:17.381
That's the Pleasant
at my job.


169
00:14:17.401 --> 00:14:19.842
In addition, I am learning
always know cool people.


170
00:14:19.862 --> 00:14:21.761
What exactly are you doing?

171
00:14:21.781 --> 00:14:24.180
I do not know
where to start.


172
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.932
The manager.

173
00:14:25.952 --> 00:14:30.645
Sometimes I cook
or yoga teacher or tour guide.


174
00:14:30.665 --> 00:14:34.440
Girlfriend, if someone needs a.
- I'd like to do but have not yoga.


175
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.485
Seven clock tomorrow morning.
In all its freshness. - Ouch!


176
00:14:37.505 --> 00:14:39.737
And when does the second hour?

177
00:14:39.757 --> 00:14:42.374
Only to be number two,
you're accustomed.


178
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.376
Very funny.

179
00:14:48.349 --> 00:14:49.965
That was a splash.

180
00:14:57.441 --> 00:15:00.508
I like the prelude.
Especially if he knows what he's doing.


181
00:15:00.528 --> 00:15:01.814
Yes, great.

182
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.444
Okay, so,
I must confess to you what.


183
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.403
I've never really done.

184
00:15:12.039 --> 00:15:14.105
Hey, I can muck, myself.

185
00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:17.567
Already clear.
I make the guys pretty sharp.


186
00:15:17.587 --> 00:15:22.446
But I was very conservative upbringing.
So, after all. I'm still virgin.


187
00:15:22.466 --> 00:15:24.282
But that's okay for me.

188
00:15:24.302 --> 00:15:28.171
Everything else I've done.
No shit, everything.


189
00:15:28.848 --> 00:15:32.558
Want to wait until the wedding?
- No. That's not it.


190
00:15:33.144 --> 00:15:34.959
For the right person happens's.

191
00:15:34.979 --> 00:15:36.811
What are you waiting, Lola?

192
00:15:37.023 --> 00:15:41.215
At a friend, a lover,
a married types, an ax murderer?


193
00:15:41.235 --> 00:15:44.023
So, if I'm honest,
I've never been in love.


194
00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:47.363
I do not even know
how love feels.


195
00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:50.016
Can you tell me that?

196
00:15:50.036 --> 00:15:51.743
I can try.

197
00:15:53.664 --> 00:15:59.160
I might even say,
that love and I are old friends.


198
00:15:59.503 --> 00:16:03.463
Anyway, there is nothing better,
as the feeling of love or ...


199
00:16:05.593 --> 00:16:08.961
... The feeling in someone
really love to be.


200
00:16:09.305 --> 00:16:13.015
I guess,
does not help me.


201
00:16:13.976 --> 00:16:16.434
Only patience.
That will come.


202
00:16:17.647 --> 00:16:20.046
Well, I think,
I'm going in now.


203
00:16:20.066 --> 00:16:23.924
Or I'll go walk on the beach.
I can not decide anyway.


204
00:16:23.944 --> 00:16:26.561
So to me
now waiting for my bed.


205
00:16:27.031 --> 00:16:31.682
I have, in the middle
at night a yoga class.


206
00:16:31.702 --> 00:16:34.194
Me too.
- Thank you for the good conversation, Maureen.


207
00:17:05.986 --> 00:17:07.602
Come on out!

208
00:17:11.117 --> 00:17:12.983
Come out! Is okay!

209
00:17:22.002 --> 00:17:24.289
I'm sorry,
if I scared you.


210
00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.626
I have looked at Maggie.

211
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.087
She looks damn good.

212
00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:33.421
But you're not bad either.

213
00:17:38.602 --> 00:17:40.559
You can indeed look calm.

214
00:17:41.564 --> 00:17:43.601
Did you her already said?

215
00:17:44.233 --> 00:17:45.940
I could never do.

216
00:17:46.986 --> 00:17:48.551
Hey, never say never.

217
00:17:48.571 --> 00:17:51.439
If you hire the right,
makes you go that way already.


218
00:17:56.579 --> 00:17:59.196
Would you give me
my robe rich?


219
00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:04.535
Clear.

220
00:18:25.816 --> 00:18:27.102
This coat here?

221
00:18:28.027 --> 00:18:29.484
Yes, the Blue.

222
00:18:51.175 --> 00:18:54.134
Easy Leg him down here.
- Okay.


223
00:19:00.142 --> 00:19:01.178
Here.

224
00:19:02.645 --> 00:19:03.852
Thank you.

225
00:19:08.108 --> 00:19:09.394
I'm going again.

226
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:56.271
Hey!
That's you.


227
00:19:59.076 --> 00:20:03.036
With you I have no more today
expected. - And what are you doing here?


228
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:05.906
I can not sleep.
- Why not?


229
00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:08.457
Because I always
must think about you.


230
00:20:10.671 --> 00:20:15.197
Jenna, Jenna!
Say, why are you?


231
00:20:15.217 --> 00:20:20.679
Keep The Love lighter wings
these walls was not made of stone.


232
00:20:21.348 --> 00:20:25.934
Now you leave me so unsatisfied?

233
00:20:26.729 --> 00:20:29.767
And what satisfaction
can it be today?


234
00:20:30.858 --> 00:20:32.506
He did not
written exactly


235
00:20:32.526 --> 00:20:36.135
but how do I know Shakespeare,
he would now say: "Come to me".


236
00:20:36.155 --> 00:20:37.942
Give me a moment.

237
00:20:38.324 --> 00:20:41.056
Come on, I catch you.

Absolutely no thing.

241
00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.407
Ready? - And how.
- Ready? Good.


242
00:20:51.128 --> 00:20:52.401
Everything OK?

243
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:55.029
If you anhättest no panties,
I could start right away.


244
00:20:55.049 --> 00:20:58.073
I understand you so bad.
Say that again please just.


245
00:20:58.093 --> 00:21:01.577
I could set it aside.
I'm a master of the tongue.


246
00:21:01.597 --> 00:21:04.663
Aha, a master of the tongue.
- Convince yourself of it.


247
00:21:04.683 --> 00:21:06.720
Wait.
- Do you like that?


248
00:21:07.978 --> 00:21:09.344
Someone's coming.

249
00:21:13.984 --> 00:21:15.976
Stop, someone's coming.

250
00:21:21.116 --> 00:21:24.109
Are you all right, kid?
Are you about all alone?


251
00:21:25.663 --> 00:21:26.949
Yes.

252
00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:30.407
Yes.

253
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.966
But I would not want you here
my favorite walk sit stay.


254
00:21:48.727 --> 00:21:51.043
I need a lot of movement.

255
00:21:51.063 --> 00:21:54.773
As a compensation. For my age
I'm always pretty namely wuschig.


256
00:21:57.152 --> 00:22:01.762
Say, you're with your parents
or a couple of friends here?


257
00:22:01.782 --> 00:22:03.148
Or all alone?

258
00:22:03.742 --> 00:22:05.028

259
00:22:05.786 --> 00:22:09.154
No, lady, I mean ...

Oh, my darling,

262
00:22:16.839 --> 00:22:22.324
... Actually else

263
00:22:22.344 --> 00:22:23.551
Ma'am?

264
00:22:24.763 --> 00:22:27.471
Oh God!
- Shall I get you a blanket?


265
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.417
No thanks.
- Here, take my scarf.


266
00:22:31.437 --> 00:22:34.586
No. 
- Yes Yes.

267
00:22:34.606 --> 00:22:37.223
Good. 
- Yes, much better.

268
00:22:46.702 --> 00:22:50.992
Cuckoo!
I found you.


269
00:22:54.418 --> 00:22:57.911
Was it just for you horny
as for you, young man?


270
00:23:00.591 --> 00:23:02.207
Now it's my turn.

271
00:23:03.052 --> 00:23:05.451
Just do not, Lady!
I'm warning you! - Shame.


272
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:09.010
But I Publish my phone number
at Miss Maureen, okay?


273
00:23:12.978 --> 00:23:15.044
I live very close.

274
00:23:15.064 --> 00:23:18.130
In the senior residence 'Feierabend'.
- Yes OK.


275
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:21.359
And you, my child, have to learn,
to share in life.


276
00:23:22.071 --> 00:23:25.109
Bye! - Bye!
Nice to meet you.


277
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.060
What did you do to your
Defense put forward?


278
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.037
Thank you. Okay?

279
00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:43.457
Now you're with the supervision of it.
Not to look away.


280
00:24:22.214 --> 00:24:25.030
Sharks are not particularly
keen on human flesh.


281
00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:28.617
They confuse people with Robben.
The only reason it comes to shark attacks.


282
00:24:28.637 --> 00:24:32.005
Are you crazy? Why you hang here
so lazy rum? I need you.


283
00:24:33.934 --> 00:24:37.302
So, I have to ask very.
I do not hang around here.


284
00:24:38.147 --> 00:24:40.434
I am cool
after the starting yoga exercises.


285
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.216
Okay, you've caught me.
I cool my cunt.


286
00:24:44.236 --> 00:24:47.136
I hope that they
even still works.


287
00:24:47.156 --> 00:24:48.988
These are pain,
I tell you.


288
00:24:49.825 --> 00:24:54.393
I really have to say,
Yoga is very dangerous. No shit.


289
00:24:54.413 --> 00:24:56.562
So, help me up.
Help on me.


290
00:24:56.582 --> 00:24:59.825
No, not you.
Let me go. Hands off!


291
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.235
What do you need me?

292
00:25:03.255 --> 00:25:07.590
<i>Well, Lola was jogging on the beach and
has a stranded baby seal found.</i>


293
00:25:07.885 --> 00:25:10.093
Are you hurt?

294
00:25:13.849 --> 00:25:17.138
<i>They ran to Joe and has
then phoned the vet.</i>


295
00:25:17.769 --> 00:25:19.726
Make, please,
open the door. - Clear.


296
00:25:23.025 --> 00:25:24.687
Is a funny guy.

297
00:25:25.694 --> 00:25:29.011
<i>Dr. Spencer has his him in
Brought Institute for marine mammals.</i>


298
00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:31.763
<i>Now Lola wants a Charity Party
on the legs,</i>


299
00:25:31.783 --> 00:25:33.695
<i>for donations
to collect the seal.</i>


300
00:25:34.077 --> 00:25:36.059
I find really strong.
- Thanks man.


301
00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:39.038
At the party I am
definitely at the start.


302
00:25:40.918 --> 00:25:43.275
So, then I'm
definitely at the start.


303
00:25:43.295 --> 00:25:46.195
You wanted to come anyway.
- I wish that? - Yes.


304
00:25:46.215 --> 00:25:49.448
Here's it but pretty cool.
- Out here? - Sure, of course.


305
00:25:49.468 --> 00:25:52.075
Namely, with a live band.

306
00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:56.413
We have space for more than
hundred partygoers. Bar tables, bar.


307
00:25:56.433 --> 00:25:57.915
Oh yes, that is good.

308
00:25:57.935 --> 00:26:01.418
While we have a whole list
aufgebrummt with rules get,


309
00:26:01.438 --> 00:26:04.588
But we can
certainly talk to Maureen.


310
00:26:04.608 --> 00:26:07.591
You have really a plan.
- Oh yes, and as I have to.


311
00:26:07.611 --> 00:26:10.344
Is like a fashion show,
just without Models.


312
00:26:10.364 --> 00:26:14.848
So with less Zickerei. And who knows,
what I still think of everything to Friday.


313
00:26:14.868 --> 00:26:16.767
Incidentally, the party is on Friday.

314
00:26:16.787 --> 00:26:18.435
Yeah!

315
00:26:18.455 --> 00:26:19.616
Not you.

316
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.418
Hey, excuse me!
Do you have a second?


317
00:26:30.717 --> 00:26:32.866
Yes, already. What's up?
- Excellent, man.


318
00:26:32.886 --> 00:26:36.095
Andy West. For friends:
Andy West Coast. Tips joke, huh?


319
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.040
I'm Agent. And in this job
I'm always looking for Models.


320
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.543
You have a really interesting face.
My card. - No shit? - Yes.


321
00:26:43.563 --> 00:26:45.212
But you hear
probably ever.


322
00:26:45.232 --> 00:26:49.226
Because you, my friend,
look like a real movie star.


323
00:26:50.362 --> 00:26:53.178
Suppose I am interested.
- Did you Headshots?


324
00:26:53.198 --> 00:26:54.985
Is that something to drink?

325
00:26:55.617 --> 00:26:57.057
Real funny, buddy!

326
00:26:57.077 --> 00:27:01.478
Just go once a bartender and say,
you would have liked a few headshots with ice.


327
00:27:01.498 --> 00:27:04.815
No, little one, now let's be serious.
These are pictures, man.


328
00:27:04.835 --> 00:27:08.277
So professional photos.
Do you have any? - No I did not.


329
00:27:08.297 --> 00:27:10.195
I ... - It does not matter
we do it like this:


330
00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:12.114
I call to a colleague.
The cares drum.


331
00:27:12.134 --> 00:27:15.575
Be easy back here tomorrow.
Namely, at the same time. - Cool.


332
00:27:15.595 --> 00:27:16.618
Cool thing, man!

333
00:27:16.638 --> 00:27:18.745
Do me a Favour
and wear something fancier.


334
00:27:18.765 --> 00:27:20.427
I would say,
a white shirt.


335
00:27:20.726 --> 00:27:24.876
Wait a minute. Perhaps the police chief.
See you tomorrow. Okay?


336
00:27:24.896 --> 00:27:26.262
Hi, yes ...

337

00:28:08.607 --> 00:28:10.088

00:28:34.007 --> 00:28:34.918
Really?

347
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.840
But is nice of you. - Is really not a thing.
You guys deserve this.


348
00:28:57.072 --> 00:29:01.282
May we ever a little nibble?
- It's out of the question. Only when he's finished.


349
00:29:22.806 --> 00:29:25.163
Are the dolphins?
Right there in front.


350
00:29:25.183 --> 00:29:29.418
What dolphins? I am fully on dolphins.
- Yes, I think that's what. - I see nothing.


351
00:29:29.438 --> 00:29:32.045
Pudding.
Can I have some?


352
00:29:32.065 --> 00:29:35.433
Actually, I have the
only for the guys made. - Oh shame.


353
00:29:35.986 --> 00:29:38.729
Yes that is
a real men's pudding.


354
00:29:39.114 --> 00:29:41.763
Men pudding?
I've never heard of.


355
00:29:41.783 --> 00:29:45.183
Hey, I have a couple of yoga exercises
not clear. Will you show it to me again? - Clear.


356
00:29:45.203 --> 00:29:47.069
I'm curious.

357
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:51.248
Beautifully eat, guys.

358
00:30:01.344 --> 00:30:03.410
Oh yeah. Really delicious.

359
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.829
That is
the best pudding ever.


360
00:30:05.849 --> 00:30:09.291
No shit. - Thank you.
- What is the secret truth?


361
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:12.169
How do you mean?
- Why it tastes so good?


362
00:30:12.189 --> 00:30:15.881
Well, the recipe is from my mother,
and she always said,


363
00:30:15.901 --> 00:30:18.884
that one easily
to cook with love.


364
00:30:18.904 --> 00:30:21.772
Oh, with love.
Is indeed cute.


365
00:30:23.074 --> 00:30:25.031
So then,
see you later.


366
00:30:26.161 --> 00:30:28.118
I hope,
that comes back out well.


367
00:30:30.665 --> 00:30:35.535
What did she mean by that? - Wives.
The often say things that make no sense.


368
00:30:42.511 --> 00:30:44.218
Is really the hammer.

369
00:30:49.017 --> 00:30:50.974
Is a gustatory orgasm.

370
00:30:58.485 --> 00:31:00.101
Fuck it all.

371
00:31:02.656 --> 00:31:04.363
Let nothing go to waste.

372
00:31:05.784 --> 00:31:07.150
Saugut.

373
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.792
This is too good.

374
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:29.996
Revenge is sweet.

375
00:31:30.016 --> 00:31:31.882
Especially with a pudding.

376
00:31:33.478 --> 00:31:36.016
Set camera?
- Camera set!


377
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.090
Can we Use
see on the phone? - Yup. - Cool.


378
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.397
Only a matter of time. 
- Yes Yes...

379
00:31:43.071 --> 00:31:44.778
Then we wait times.

380
00:31:45.574 --> 00:31:48.783
Here's what in the bush?
- No. - For sure?


381
00:31:49.703 --> 00:31:53.436
Out with it or I
tickle's you out. - I would not advise you.


382
00:31:53.456 --> 00:31:55.243
For sure?

383
00:31:56.626 --> 00:31:58.275
I give up!

384
00:31:58.295 --> 00:31:59.752
Want's to tell me?

385
00:32:02.048 --> 00:32:03.255
Okay.

386
00:32:03.758 --> 00:32:04.874
So ...

387
00:32:06.052 --> 00:32:10.829
We want to male
Roommates avenge their Spanner action.


388
00:32:10.849 --> 00:32:14.291
And now is the camera
directly in their shithouse.


389
00:32:14.311 --> 00:32:16.585
I installed it.
- "Iiih". How so?


390
00:32:16.605 --> 00:32:20.338
"Iiih" real word. But I have
Used gloves. - Yes, good.


391
00:32:20.358 --> 00:32:22.520
Okay, and now comes the best part.

392
00:32:23.361 --> 00:32:29.264
Perhaps they have chocolate pudding with
tons of really nasty laxative gefuttert.


393
00:32:29.284 --> 00:32:33.685
Holy shit. - That's right,
it takes no longer determined long,


394
00:32:33.705 --> 00:32:37.564
until we here the results of our cute,
see little experiment.


395
00:32:37.584 --> 00:32:41.248
Guys, how about
with a round of football?


396
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.747
Cool, right?
We can indeed ask the worm.


397
00:32:49.554 --> 00:32:51.420
What's wrong with him?
- If yes evil!


398
00:32:59.439 --> 00:33:00.725
Oh, man, shit.

399
00:33:01.107 --> 00:33:05.351
So a lousy digestion.
You two really totally weak stomachs.


400
00:33:30.929 --> 00:33:32.716
Nuclear war in the gut.

401
00:33:38.186 --> 00:33:39.142
Johnny.

402
00:33:39.604 --> 00:33:40.720
Johnny!

403
00:33:45.151 --> 00:33:46.517
Is that disgusting.

404
00:33:46.861 --> 00:33:47.977
Johnny?

405
00:33:52.784 --> 00:33:53.900
Oh, fuck!

406
00:33:56.746 --> 00:33:58.061
Drink this.

407
00:33:58.081 --> 00:33:59.697
Beer has the opposite effect.

408
00:34:02.794 --> 00:34:04.001
Shit, really bad.

409
00:34:09.467 --> 00:34:10.833
Sorry, dude.

410
00:34:15.432 --> 00:34:16.413
Shit!

411
00:34:16.433 --> 00:34:18.140
Damn, Johnny, no!

412
00:34:24.274 --> 00:34:26.231
Was that a charge, damn.

413
00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:40.116
Man, is that crass!

414
00:34:41.624 --> 00:34:43.286
Fuck, what's going on?

415
00:34:54.053 --> 00:34:55.260
Fuck!

416
00:34:56.264 --> 00:34:57.380
Shit!

417
00:34:57.682 --> 00:34:58.718
Damn it!

418
00:35:09.068 --> 00:35:10.525
Holy shit!

419
00:35:11.029 --> 00:35:13.567
You too?
- Yes, and how.


420
00:35:26.336 --> 00:35:27.734
That is so disgusting.

421
00:35:27.754 --> 00:35:30.462
One more time!
Oh man!


422
00:35:32.467 --> 00:35:34.424
Oh God!

423
00:35:36.763 --> 00:35:40.205
Unbelievable.
I weggekackt three kilos.


424
00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:41.932
Three kilos weggekackt.

425
00:35:42.769 --> 00:35:44.886
The abdominal muscles feel great.

426
00:35:47.065 --> 00:35:50.354
Oh, fuck!

427
00:35:52.695 --> 00:35:53.902
Is this nasty.

428
00:35:59.035 --> 00:36:01.851
Dude, no! Dude! No!
- Oh no. I can not get ...


429
00:36:01.871 --> 00:36:04.687
No, no ... 
- Dude!

430
00:36:04.707 --> 00:36:07.232
Damn it all!
Listen only on, dude!


431
00:36:07.252 --> 00:36:08.900
Here, take the beer.

432
00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.957
Here, my hand.
- Okay.


433
00:36:34.779 --> 00:36:38.263
A satisfaction. - That comes but
something from the Internet, right?


434
00:36:38.283 --> 00:36:42.350
Sure, of course. What do you think, how many
You-Tube-clicks we get for it?


435
00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.862
Much shit?
- Then it fits yes!


436
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.622
The sluts we do cold.

437
00:36:51.421 --> 00:36:52.457
However.

438
00:36:54.048 --> 00:36:56.335
Briefing.

439
00:36:58.011 --> 00:36:59.284
What you have there?

440
00:36:59.304 --> 00:37:03.719
That's my secret,
small security camera.


441
00:37:04.225 --> 00:37:05.790
I've found in the toilet.

442
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:09.586
And here I have the unique
Proof that we were poisoned.


443
00:37:09.606 --> 00:37:11.973
Of these damned
Bitch wives.


444
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:14.424
That was in the garbage.

445
00:37:14.444 --> 00:37:17.858
Our shits
comes from the pudding.


446
00:37:18.823 --> 00:37:22.140
Then who so your
small hidden camera tensioner


447
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.144
and palmed us because
in their super delicious chocolate pudding?


448
00:37:26.164 --> 00:37:28.897
Actually it was quite funny
and we survived it. - Toll!


449
00:37:28.917 --> 00:37:32.942
Probably, it is already online,
if I judge this Lola properly.


450
00:37:32.962 --> 00:37:36.421
If they want war,
then she gets him.


451
00:37:36.925 --> 00:37:40.241
Hey, dude, so I do not think
that it has put online.


452
00:37:40.261 --> 00:37:42.619
Get your easy loose.
Funny is funny.


453
00:37:42.639 --> 00:37:46.164
You've got the fucking camera in their
Room hidden. Have you started.


454
00:37:46.184 --> 00:37:47.540
That's not the same.

455
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.127
We must make it clear to them,
that they have gone too far.


456
00:37:51.147 --> 00:37:55.089
Because maybe I get
Reparation sex of Maggie.


457
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:57.759
Or maybe as
Excuse me a video.


458
00:37:57.779 --> 00:38:01.179
So one that I then me alone
can look at in my spare time.


459
00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:03.097
I give myself even
satisfied with a photo.


460
00:38:03.117 --> 00:38:04.403
I'm a likeable guy.

461
00:38:06.412 --> 00:38:07.528
Jenna!

462
00:38:11.376 --> 00:38:13.691
I'm sorry, honestly.

463
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:15.998
Us does it quite the same suffering.

464
00:38:17.006 --> 00:38:19.614
That was mean.
- I had no idea.


465
00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:21.796
Honestly not.
Otherwise I would have warned you.


466
00:38:45.243 --> 00:38:46.724
<i>Hey, this is Andy West.</i>

467
00:38:46.744 --> 00:38:49.602
<i>Sorry that I your call
can not accept in person.</i>


468
00:38:49.622 --> 00:38:52.330
<i>Leave me
please leave a message. Ciao.</i>


469
00:39:00.466 --> 00:39:02.532
Have ye found not funny?

470
00:39:02.552 --> 00:39:04.919
No,
So I can not say.


471
00:39:06.472 --> 00:39:10.011
You're doing a great noise.
- Hey, so please. We walk a bit.


472
00:39:14.897 --> 00:39:17.514
Do you think you already
Nasties from?


473
00:39:18.484 --> 00:39:24.554
Well, to be honest, we are ashamed
all of us for what we have done.


474
00:39:24.574 --> 00:39:27.515
Even Jenna, although they
has it knew nothing.


475
00:39:27.535 --> 00:39:30.518
We will prepare you
We are sorry for dinner.


476
00:39:30.538 --> 00:39:32.905
An especially
delicious Thai food.


477
00:39:33.124 --> 00:39:36.524
That will put you
the guys do not buy.


478
00:39:36.544 --> 00:39:40.820
I also do not know if I sisters you
after this shit action still to be trusted.


479
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.299
Please, please, please,
Accept the apology.


480
00:39:48.389 --> 00:39:51.122
Well, I suppose they,
but that only applies to me.


481
00:39:51.142 --> 00:39:54.333
With Charlie and Vincent
you will still need to talk.


482
00:39:54.353 --> 00:39:55.668
Sure, of course.

483
00:39:55.688 --> 00:39:56.974
Good.

484
00:40:01.986 --> 00:40:06.179
I think Johnny is a very honest
and pretty nice boy.


485
00:40:06.199 --> 00:40:09.682
And he looks good enough to eat,
have you not noticed.


486
00:40:09.702 --> 00:40:14.020
That just adds properly. - Displays Lola,
"That does not know how love feels,"


487
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.397
about interest
the opposite sex?


488
00:40:16.417 --> 00:40:19.535
I just said,
He's a nice guy and no more.


489
00:40:20.296 --> 00:40:21.832
You know what?

490
00:40:23.466 --> 00:40:27.116
I ventured enough
to know that when someone says:


491
00:40:27.136 --> 00:40:30.425
and no more,
which actually means the opposite.


492
00:40:32.433 --> 00:40:34.999
You tolerate anyway
no contradiction.


493
00:40:35.019 --> 00:40:37.168
So what.

494
00:40:37.188 --> 00:40:40.755
<i>♪ Lola loves Johnny!
Lola loves Johnny!</i>


495
00:40:40.775 --> 00:40:43.007
Stop!
He might hear you yet.


496
00:40:43.027 --> 00:40:46.427
You like him, then?
- Just not. Just not!


497
00:40:46.447 --> 00:40:49.013
Oh.
- Oh but. Oh but


498
00:40:49.033 --> 00:40:52.572
Liar, liar,
you're an old liar.


499
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:56.038
Well,
He's a hot guy.


500
00:40:56.457 --> 00:40:57.993
Well finally.

501
00:40:58.793 --> 00:41:01.706
I'll tell you what we are doing now.
We show him the way.


502
00:41:02.004 --> 00:41:06.155
Before dinner, you will make yourself up.
You have to make yourself really sexy.


503
00:41:06.175 --> 00:41:09.325
I also have a top case.
That is it in combination with your tits


504
00:41:09.345 --> 00:41:12.620
simply cut only from the stool.
But really. - All right.


505
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.749
Do you promise me that you behave,
while I'm away? - Of course.


506
00:41:16.769 --> 00:41:18.556
Okay, see you later.

507
00:41:22.692 --> 00:41:25.424
What are you already doing again?
- Nothing, why?


508
00:41:25.444 --> 00:41:28.812
If only once again a secret ingredient.
For those who love boys.


509
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:32.515
What is it now?

510
00:41:32.535 --> 00:41:36.074
A little finesse,
supports their masculinity.


511
00:41:36.914 --> 00:41:38.871
Aha, their masculinity.

512
00:41:40.126 --> 00:41:43.985
For someone who has never had sex,
you have it but sly old ears.


513
00:41:44.005 --> 00:41:47.071
We Jenna promised,
that we no longer do such things.


514
00:41:47.091 --> 00:41:49.208
You might.
And if.


515
00:41:52.763 --> 00:41:54.470
Food is ready!

516
00:41:58.186 --> 00:41:59.552
Smells so yummy.

517
00:41:59.979 --> 00:42:03.347
Oh, no, Charlie.
The place is only reserved otherwise.


518
00:42:04.358 --> 00:42:06.674
Is indeed something completely new.
I did not realize,


519
00:42:06.694 --> 00:42:11.485
that the spaces are allocated here.
- Charlie, sit down next to me, please, okay?


520
00:42:24.462 --> 00:42:25.748
Johnny.

521
00:42:27.423 --> 00:42:28.905
Earth Johnny!

522
00:42:28.925 --> 00:42:31.042
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Thank you.


523
00:42:32.678 --> 00:42:34.827
Tell me,
what does that mean?


524
00:42:34.847 --> 00:42:39.957
An Asian, good food.
Muay Thai.


525
00:42:39.977 --> 00:42:42.126
Does not
a martial art?


526
00:42:42.146 --> 00:42:46.547
Is not it. - Who says we
can trust you? - Yes that's true.


527
00:42:46.567 --> 00:42:50.026
Oh please, but everything is back
came out, is not it?


528
00:42:51.405 --> 00:42:56.849
My dad always says, and is a doctor,
over Poop will not talk while eating.


529
00:42:56.869 --> 00:42:59.236
Guys,
We're really very sorry.


530
00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.324
Maggie was the whole day in the kitchen
and has toiled without end,


531
00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:07.276

Of course they expected because that ...

... Her pure skin.

533
00:43:12.218 --> 00:43:16.535
Here, this special sauce
belongs necessarily so.


534
00:43:16.555 --> 00:43:18.512
What do you all have
after eating before?


535
00:43:19.725 --> 00:43:22.375
So we go afterwards
definitely a party.


536
00:43:22.395 --> 00:43:25.878
There is a band playing and we want to check,
whether it is good for our fundraising event.


537
00:43:25.898 --> 00:43:28.265
Cool, we are the
Daredevil troupe.


538
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:35.596
Okay, well, cool.

539
00:43:35.616 --> 00:43:38.224
So, we are not yet
the daredevil troupe.


540
00:43:38.244 --> 00:43:44.206
You do not like the term well.
Forget it. No shit, I ...


541
00:43:46.919 --> 00:43:51.570
Sorry, friends. That's a private party
and you will not get in.


542
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:53.297
Take care, friends, makes it good.

You look so familiar.
Do we know each other?

553
00:44:22.288 --> 00:44:26.188
There is a difference because there ...
- Listen.


554

I know the difference.
Are you telling me I'm stupid?

I do not find that funny.
Not at all.

I wanted to also not be funny,
but rather practical.


594
00:48:24.822 --> 00:48:27.471
All right. - But if you do not ...
You already know...


595
00:48:27.491 --> 00:48:30.780
Can we perhaps it
use as a hat rack?


596
00:48:31.954 --> 00:48:35.020
As a shoehorn?
We can also throw horseshoes.

euern had fun.


607
00:49:49.865 --> 00:49:52.232
Well, more remains for us.

608
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.893
I do not know how it's done to you,
but after many dancing at the party,


609
00:49:55.913 --> 00:50:00.397
I have a hammer moderate Kohldampf.
I suppose six. Please stacked.


610
00:50:00.417 --> 00:50:04.234
Come immediately. - I can not's
suffer when food is thrown away.


611
00:50:04.254 --> 00:50:07.446
So, I take a few.
- I like that about you. - On principle.


612
00:50:07.466 --> 00:50:09.740
Here please.
- I'll show you how to be eaten.


613
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.326
We eat from the same plate.
- No, we are not.


614
00:50:12.346 --> 00:50:13.757
Too late.
- It's okay.


615
00:50:18.602 --> 00:50:23.629
Small, you have something
Eaten bad or ...


616
00:50:23.649 --> 00:50:25.798
I'm doing so crappy.

617
00:50:25.818 --> 00:50:31.280
Although is very intimate,
but you had sex in the last few days?


618
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.907
But I have not rumgehurt.

619
00:50:35.577 --> 00:50:39.978
Well, you're too late
or you have not you protected?


620
00:50:39.998 --> 00:50:44.368
You do not think that ... - I think
you should take this test, Jenna.


621
00:50:50.217 --> 00:50:51.532
You know how that goes?

622
00:50:51.552 --> 00:50:54.702
Have previously never made a,
if that's your question.


623
00:50:54.722 --> 00:50:58.557
Is everything in the package.
Let me know if I can help you.


624
00:50:59.476 --> 00:51:00.683
Thank you.

What is it to you for a warthog
raced through the liver?


632
00:52:02.581 --> 00:52:05.073
Hey! - So see you soon.
- Bye, Honey. - Bye.


633
00:52:06.293 --> 00:52:09.026
Call me from Paris.
- Yes I do. - Promised? - Yes.


634
00:52:09.046 --> 00:52:12.505
Okay I got it.
I wish you a good flight. Bye Bye.


635
00:52:14.551 --> 00:52:18.921
Damn it. I guess I'm at
a turning point arrived, man.


636
00:52:19.765 --> 00:52:22.372
You need Joe,
Be the lifeguards.


637
00:52:22.392 --> 00:52:24.708
Johnny, right?
- Yes, how did you know?


638
00:52:24.728 --> 00:52:28.045
I am pleased. I deal
me always with the winners.


639
00:52:28.065 --> 00:52:30.102
I want to know,
who depends here.


640
00:52:31.151 --> 00:52:32.517
So what's up?

641
00:52:32.986 --> 00:52:36.637
I'm not sure, because I
have never thought about it.


642
00:52:36.657 --> 00:52:39.195
Who pulls the well
serious consideration?


643
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:42.559
Believe me,
Such problems have very many.


644
00:52:42.579 --> 00:52:44.812
You're out of here.

645
00:52:44.832 --> 00:52:47.314
Is anyone ever
come to the beach


646
00:52:47.334 --> 00:52:51.328
and has offered you
To become a movie star and model?


647
00:52:51.922 --> 00:52:54.710
Was that a guy or a woman?
- That was a guy.


648
00:52:55.384 --> 00:52:58.283
Did he touch your penis
or a different part of the body?


649
00:52:58.303 --> 00:53:00.869
Oh no, in this direction it is
not gone. - If yes may be.


650
00:53:00.889 --> 00:53:03.472
I have to exclude it.
Well, listen.


651
00:53:03.809 --> 00:53:06.597
I think something comes
every now and then before.


652
00:53:07.229 --> 00:53:09.878
And if you believe,
that what is for you,


653
00:53:09.898 --> 00:53:12.185
Then Try it out for yourself.

654
00:53:12.526 --> 00:53:15.509
Thank you, Joe.
No thing, man. Good luck with it.


655
00:53:15.529 --> 00:53:17.316
Thank you.
- Keep me up to date.


656
00:53:17.865 --> 00:53:20.403
That should not have happened.
Not really.


657
00:53:20.951 --> 00:53:24.490
That was a few weeks ago
and he is a huge asshole.


658
00:53:25.497 --> 00:53:28.911
At least for one thing
he had to use surely.


659
00:53:32.588 --> 00:53:34.736
This is not now
the right time for such a thing.


660
00:53:34.756 --> 00:53:38.156
It just developed
everything really well with Vincent.


661
00:53:38.176 --> 00:53:40.742
I thought,
that could be really something,


662
00:53:40.762 --> 00:53:43.912
and if I say it to him,
He will hate me for all time.


663
00:53:43.932 --> 00:53:45.969
And if not you tell him?

664
00:53:46.226 --> 00:53:48.876
You make it easy
your little secret.


665
00:53:48.896 --> 00:53:52.129
If yes just typical.
But I pull something not.


666
00:53:52.149 --> 00:53:54.357
I would never do that to him.

667
00:53:54.943 --> 00:53:58.594
Want to have the baby?
- Can I get you now not answer.


668
00:53:58.614 --> 00:54:01.847
I am actually much too young.
- You do not have to justify yourself.


669
00:54:01.867 --> 00:54:05.517
Not really. Before anyone.
Do what you think is right.


670
00:54:05.537 --> 00:54:08.604
Perhaps the bond
between Vincent and you strong enough.


671
00:54:08.624 --> 00:54:11.231
No she is not.
I can not do this.


672
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:14.369
I can not do that to him the real.
I can not but ...


673
00:54:16.882 --> 00:54:17.998
Shit.

674
00:54:20.761 --> 00:54:22.627
You have to give time to her now.

675
00:54:38.654 --> 00:54:39.940
Hey, Johnny!

676
00:54:41.657 --> 00:54:43.023
Hi, Lola!

677
00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:46.808
Beautiful bikini. 
- Thank you.

678
00:54:46.828 --> 00:54:49.787
I hop into the hot tub now.
Want to come in with?


679
00:54:51.458 --> 00:54:54.075
According to me.
- I do not want to compel yes.


680
00:54:55.379 --> 00:54:58.028
Sorry, I'm just
not particularly good mood.


681
00:54:58.048 --> 00:55:00.489
Is somehow a
pretty strange day today.


682
00:55:00.509 --> 00:55:01.875
What happened?

683
00:55:02.928 --> 00:55:06.888
Nothing at all. Have still no owner
what belongs. That's the problem.


684
00:55:08.141 --> 00:55:10.098
Then come on in now.

685
00:55:11.311 --> 00:55:13.043
Actually, you're
not my type,


686
00:55:13.063 --> 00:55:16.101
but I'll simply times
make an exception with you.


687
00:55:16.984 --> 00:55:18.600
That is nice of you.

688
00:55:19.027 --> 00:55:22.427
I am not only
the successful college athlete.


689
00:55:22.447 --> 00:55:26.441
I have more hopes
and dreams. I have a degree.


690
00:55:27.077 --> 00:55:29.768
What did you study?
- Sport Sciences.


691
00:55:29.788 --> 00:55:33.105
But one day, as I had
an experience that everything has changed.


692
00:55:33.125 --> 00:55:35.742
That was nice
a while ago in a theater.


693
00:55:38.422 --> 00:55:40.379
Since I had my doubts.

694
00:55:42.634 --> 00:55:45.422
What? I thought,
I'm not your type.


695
00:55:46.346 --> 00:55:49.214
I told you that I
when you make an exception.


696
00:55:52.853 --> 00:55:55.085
But you did not
something tipped into the water?


697
00:55:55.105 --> 00:55:59.065
I'm understandably cautious.
- Is nothing in it except me.


698
00:56:00.277 --> 00:56:01.393
All right.

699
00:56:07.701 --> 00:56:10.267
If a horse in a bar.
The bartender says:


700
00:56:10.287 --> 00:56:12.028
"Why the long face?"

701
00:56:13.707 --> 00:56:16.565
Checked?
- The Gag is 100 years old.


702
00:56:16.585 --> 00:56:19.401
I think I am
really at a crossroads.


703
00:56:19.421 --> 00:56:22.988
No matter which way I look,
everywhere just wasteland.


704
00:56:23.008 --> 00:56:26.342
I have until a week ago
not even seen the sea.


705
00:56:26.803 --> 00:56:29.536
Now I swim in it rum.
Only a few days ago


706
00:56:29.556 --> 00:56:33.040
a stranger comes up to me
and offers me that he helps me,


707
00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.426
my dream to live.

708
00:56:34.895 --> 00:56:37.210
No shit,
how often does something like that before already?


709
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:39.588
Was clear that he
now no longer reports.


710
00:56:39.608 --> 00:56:44.551
I could see already that it on
the world is so much more than I thought times.


711
00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:48.972
Everyone has actually a lot more options.
I think I'll move here.


712
00:56:48.992 --> 00:56:52.201
Very impulsive, do not you think?
- Well, if you say so.


713
00:56:52.746 --> 00:56:55.033
At home keeps me
Simply nothing.


714
00:56:55.749 --> 00:56:57.456
I'm as good as here.

715
00:57:10.847 --> 00:57:13.055
I do not know,
What I should say.


716
00:57:13.767 --> 00:57:15.554
You must indeed say anything.

717
00:57:23.944 --> 00:57:25.230
What you up to?

718
00:57:58.603 --> 00:57:59.639
Okay.

719
00:58:09.281 --> 00:58:12.820
What was that? - Sorry, I thought
Anyway, that brings women in the mood.


720
00:59:51.925 --> 00:59:53.211
Jenna?

721
00:59:55.011 --> 00:59:56.377
Hey, Jenna.

722
00:59:57.973 --> 01:00:00.431
I have you
been looking for everywhere.


723
01:00:01.518 --> 01:00:04.932
Now you've found me yes.
Unfortunately, you did.


724
01:00:07.816 --> 01:00:10.183
So please,
what do you mean "unfortunately"?


725
01:00:11.319 --> 01:00:14.261
Hey. - Have the whole day
I tried, you go out of the way.


726
01:00:14.281 --> 01:00:16.068
Here we have to talk.

727
01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:23.488
This is all much too fast to me.
Well, I really want to ...


728
01:00:24.916 --> 01:00:28.580
I can not...
I do not think this is going to work.


729
01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:33.498
Okay.

730
01:00:36.344 --> 01:00:39.286
We were maybe
really fast.


731
01:00:39.306 --> 01:00:41.705
We do now
just a little slower.


732
01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:44.791
That's fine for me.
Honest. - No, Vincent, no.


733
01:00:44.811 --> 01:00:47.849
You did not understand me.
This is not a good solution. I ...


734
01:00:48.606 --> 01:00:51.965
I think I got us
since purely ridden almost in what.


735
01:00:51.985 --> 01:00:53.772
I want to in any case.

736
01:00:54.362 --> 01:00:58.471
I ... I can not tell you,
if I'm still here tomorrow.


737
01:00:58.491 --> 01:01:00.733
I probably go
home. - What?


738
01:01:01.202 --> 01:01:04.227
You ...
You can now not go easy.


739
01:01:04.247 --> 01:01:06.980
If you do that,
it was really with us.


740
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.274
And all the others
must then also home.


741
01:01:09.294 --> 01:01:11.276
Do you really want do you mean?

742
01:01:11.296 --> 01:01:13.194
You can not be serious.

743
01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:16.582
That was until now
really nice with us two, right?


744
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.432
I would still do anything for you.

745
01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:30.670
You can not just now but
disappear from my life.


746
01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:32.056
Farewell, Vincent.

747
01:01:32.734 --> 01:01:34.851
I hope,
that we are never again.


748
01:01:36.237 --> 01:01:38.845
When I least
would know your reasons.


749
01:01:38.865 --> 01:01:42.233
Well, then I'm going.
- No, I'll go.


750
01:01:43.578 --> 01:01:45.365
I want you to stay.

751
01:02:04.432 --> 01:02:07.457
Your cute,
nocturnal visitor is back.


752
01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:10.185
Was clear. That's cute.

753
01:02:17.445 --> 01:02:20.011
Let yourself his efforts
actually completely cold?


754
01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:24.099
What should I do? Should I bring a
blow, just because he holds a candle stupid?


755
01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:26.351
I think it's beautiful
quite romantic.


756
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:29.187
If you do find that great,
then you could it perhaps


757
01:02:29.207 --> 01:02:34.401
on behalf of us both suck a.
But I should do it,


758
01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:38.381
then it will last a lifetime
on this action to masturbate.


759
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.283
I would for all time
burning in his brain


760
01:02:42.303 --> 01:02:47.014
as the little bitch that he
his brain has blown out of the tail.


761
01:02:48.435 --> 01:02:50.333
Get ready would him.

762
01:02:50.353 --> 01:02:54.313
Sorry, Charlie.
No, this is not.


763
01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:00.315
Hi.

764
01:03:03.324 --> 01:03:06.224
I'll be right back.
Or not.


765
01:03:06.244 --> 01:03:08.531
Have fun.
- I have that safe.


766
01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:15.483
Hi! - Hey!
- That's a surprise.


767
01:03:15.503 --> 01:03:19.320
Shall we two a bit
to take a walk on the beach? - Good idea.


768
01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.547
Well then go.

769
01:03:49.746 --> 01:03:51.728
Hey, you take a chair.

770
01:03:51.748 --> 01:03:55.867
Do you want a beer?
- Yes, I could well tolerated.


771
01:04:06.596 --> 01:04:08.212
So what's up?

772
01:04:09.516 --> 01:04:11.803
I can bury my future plans.

773
01:04:13.645 --> 01:04:15.181
What are your plans?

774
01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:18.880
Jenna wants again
drive back home. Tomorrow.


775
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.798
You know maybe, why?

776
01:04:20.818 --> 01:04:23.686
No, I have not heard anything.

777
01:04:24.364 --> 01:04:27.222
I can anhauen Lola,
which is to talk to her.


778
01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:28.640
What was that?

779
01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:30.308
Jenna?

780
01:04:30.328 --> 01:04:32.365
You do not want to
come to me down?


781
01:04:34.332 --> 01:04:38.066
You know exactly
that the situation does not change,


782
01:04:38.086 --> 01:04:40.652
just because you're in your
Schneckenhaus verkriechst.


783
01:04:40.672 --> 01:04:43.130
So now come down,
otherwise I get high.


784
01:04:44.342 --> 01:04:49.536
You're really very friendly and I know
appreciate the fact that you look after me.


785
01:04:49.556 --> 01:04:52.789
Even in places that I thought,
that no one will find me there,


786
01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:55.625
and the already
the second time this week.


787
01:04:55.645 --> 01:05:00.713
But just because you found me,
that does not mean that you know me.


788
01:05:00.733 --> 01:05:03.591
Or?
You do not know me, no.


789
01:05:03.611 --> 01:05:07.303
And you also do not know anything
about me and my life, Maureen.


790
01:05:07.323 --> 01:05:09.360
Okay, that's enough now.
I'll be high.


791
01:05:11.244 --> 01:05:14.686
But I know you well enough,
to know that you like children.


792
01:05:14.706 --> 01:05:18.746
And that you never do anything
would that could endanger a child.


793
01:05:22.213 --> 01:05:24.421
I just want to
think in peace.


794
01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:28.167
The thing about Vincent
I have finished.


795
01:05:29.596 --> 01:05:32.453
And I know,
that you will not hear the,


796
01:05:32.473 --> 01:05:36.513
but I will here certainly
can get through a day longer.


797
01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:41.559
So. - I'll leave the Beach House.
I can not do this.


798
01:05:43.443 --> 01:05:44.900
So what happens.

799
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:49.530
And I beseech thee,
Meet any hasty decisions.


800
01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:51.778
Sleep over it again.

801
01:05:58.166 --> 01:05:59.782
Who comes here?

802
01:06:02.295 --> 01:06:04.582
Can I? 
- Yeah, right.

803
01:06:07.842 --> 01:06:10.425
On the love.
- Hey, fuck you.


804
01:06:12.013 --> 01:06:15.973
Say, only is Vincent shit plan
and now you. What happened?


805
01:06:31.866 --> 01:06:34.390
Hey, all right?
- Can I have one more thing, brother?


806
01:06:34.410 --> 01:06:37.118
Yes, if you still want one.

807
01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:41.373
Respect.

808
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.217
Krass, right?

809
01:06:52.512 --> 01:06:56.472
Wow! - That was pretty bad.
So what I have never seen man.


810
01:07:02.939 --> 01:07:05.647
Dude, why are you doing this?
- What?


811
01:07:06.567 --> 01:07:08.354
What?
So much booze.


812
01:07:09.862 --> 01:07:13.346
I hate beer.
I hate how it smells.


813
01:07:13.366 --> 01:07:17.076
I hate what it tastes like.
I hate it really totally.


814
01:07:18.287 --> 01:07:20.520
That's why I can only drink so's.

815
01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:24.159
If a trick I
learned in the fraternity.


816
01:07:26.713 --> 01:07:28.796
One trick
you've learned since.


817
01:07:29.215 --> 01:07:32.907
Frankly, you do not look
as a connecting brother.


818
01:07:32.927 --> 01:07:37.297
Yes, I am indeed none.
- I do not fit to those who say that.


819
01:07:38.725 --> 01:07:41.457
Although I all their
Shit took part.


820
01:07:41.477 --> 01:07:43.434
I was shot the same.

821
01:07:44.188 --> 01:07:47.807
The only thing that I as
could pull out, is that stupid trick.


822
01:07:49.026 --> 01:07:52.815
And an idea,
what I am and what is not.


823
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.221
Then we change that.

824
01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:57.028
New meeting.

825
01:07:57.869 --> 01:08:00.268
The meeting of the Brotherhood
is hereby opened.


826
01:08:00.288 --> 01:08:02.937
I nominate Charlie
as our President.


827
01:08:02.957 --> 01:08:05.665
Those in favor, raise your hand.
- Here! - Here!


828
01:08:07.128 --> 01:08:11.247
The result is unanimous.
Charlie is the new president of the Brotherhood.


829
01:08:11.966 --> 01:08:14.754
Response!

830
01:08:15.428 --> 01:08:19.047
Only a beer,
then the speech.


831
01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:36.846
I want at
the Brotherhood to thank.


832
01:08:36.866 --> 01:08:39.825
For recognition
my leadership potential.


833
01:08:42.872 --> 01:08:49.164
I would add that this is the largest
Is honor that I have ever approached.


834
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.168
On the Brotherhood.
- In the Brotherhood!


835
01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:01.180
Do you think he was injured?
- No, the grass is still soft.


836
01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:05.305
So, he likes me
actually best.


837
01:09:07.313 --> 01:09:08.429
Well.

838
01:09:23.454 --> 01:09:25.537
You've expressed, but nice.

839
01:09:26.874 --> 01:09:29.065
Oh man,
is the ass hard.


840
01:09:29.085 --> 01:09:32.151
You know what?
You're a pretty decent guy.


841
01:09:32.171 --> 01:09:35.905
The Brotherhood leaves no
her brothers alone. - That's how it looks.


842
01:09:35.925 --> 01:09:37.461
Time for the box, Charlie.

843
01:09:42.765 --> 01:09:44.580
Today is a great day.

844
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.083
Much larger is the evening.

845
01:09:47.103 --> 01:09:48.310
Party!

846
01:09:50.064 --> 01:09:52.630
Subsequently, immediately after Yoga,
we go over


847
01:09:52.650 --> 01:09:55.466
and help others at
the preparations for the party.


848
01:09:55.486 --> 01:09:58.052
I'll call the vet also
and wonder how it's Stanley.


849
01:09:58.072 --> 01:10:00.805
Honestly,
there's even more trouble, folks.


850
01:10:00.825 --> 01:10:03.317
Jenna has with Vincent
Final done.


851
01:10:04.203 --> 01:10:06.853
Oh, here they have yet
so well fitted together.


852
01:10:06.873 --> 01:10:09.689
Yes, we have last night
on the beach talking about it.


853
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:14.193
She wants to go. If she does that,
then you have all home.


854
01:10:14.213 --> 01:10:17.780
We can not let that happen.
Thus it ruins everything. Even for itself.


855
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.615
I can not stop them.

856
01:10:19.635 --> 01:10:23.174
The only you can and you should
not leave you much time.


857
01:10:26.976 --> 01:10:30.390
I know you're doing anyway,
what you want, but we can talk?


858
01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:33.379
Exactly, I have
made my decision,


859
01:10:33.399 --> 01:10:36.299
and I do not,
that her mind yet what you can change.


860
01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:38.276
For so what friends are for.

861
01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:45.308
Vincent and you all had such a strong bond.
He deserves to know the truth.


862
01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:49.868
I do not know.
I really love him very much, but I can ...


863
01:10:50.708 --> 01:10:53.701
Well, I can not do that to him.
I do not want that.


864
01:10:54.503 --> 01:10:56.235
That would not be fair.

865
01:10:56.255 --> 01:10:59.488
In this week
but is totally much happened, right?


866
01:10:59.508 --> 01:11:01.240
So many great things.

867
01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:04.628
And we do not want to lose
and you still do not.


868
01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:09.248
Maybe you commit
the biggest mistake of your life.


869
01:11:09.268 --> 01:11:12.418
Since I have the matter
already committed.


870
01:11:12.438 --> 01:11:16.172
And I find it hard enough,
having to live with the consequences.


871
01:11:16.192 --> 01:11:18.479
There are usually
several solutions.


872
01:11:19.946 --> 01:11:22.484
Sit down.
I'll make you some tea.


873
01:11:55.106 --> 01:11:58.255
One may a decision,
which affects the rest of life,


874
01:11:58.275 --> 01:12:01.676
not break above the knee.
For everything that we decide, the following applies:


875
01:12:01.696 --> 01:12:05.262
This results in
perhaps unplanned developments.


876
01:12:05.282 --> 01:12:09.100
Everything you've done
and everything you will do even,


877
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.268
based on these decisions.

878
01:12:11.288 --> 01:12:14.939
Everything has to do with everything.
The right decision is important.


879
01:12:14.959 --> 01:12:17.024
It's okay,
I have understood.


880
01:12:17.044 --> 01:12:20.695
Take your time, you need to especially
choose wisely.


881
01:12:20.715 --> 01:12:23.823
What do you think?
How will he react to the truth?


882
01:12:23.843 --> 01:12:27.159
Hey, baby,
I'm pregnant, but not from you.


883
01:12:27.179 --> 01:12:32.081
Is not bad, right? Come on, we're getting married.
How is it looking? I bring not.


884
01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:34.583
It is a bond
received with you.


885
01:12:34.603 --> 01:12:37.812
Did he not also a right to
to decide how it's going on?


886
01:12:38.399 --> 01:12:39.755
Tomorrow.

887
01:12:39.775 --> 01:12:41.757
If I disturb,
then tells me.


888
01:12:41.777 --> 01:12:43.734
No, you do not disturb.

889
01:12:44.238 --> 01:12:47.263
Pretty underpants.
- Thank you, I also find.


890
01:12:47.283 --> 01:12:52.403
So, I'll be honest.
I was here all the time forward.


891
01:12:53.205 --> 01:12:56.480
Already spying again?
- No, that was not really my plan.


892
01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.608
I'm just awake, because I
had brutally piss. - Hey, hey!


893
01:12:59.628 --> 01:13:02.236
ZVI!
- This means that again?


894
01:13:02.256 --> 01:13:05.294
Too much information.
Again. - And further?


895
01:13:08.262 --> 01:13:10.911
I've heard everything,
I believe.


896
01:13:10.931 --> 01:13:12.705
Well, sit down.

897
01:13:12.725 --> 01:13:14.874
Then you are now
also one of the girls.


898
01:13:14.894 --> 01:13:17.261
We commit yourself
to silence.


899
01:13:18.314 --> 01:13:23.049
Silence is okay, but I have to
not be a girl, right? - But.


900
01:13:23.069 --> 01:13:25.384
This is a sisterhood.
Swear.


901
01:13:25.404 --> 01:13:28.012
Then I am a brother
and a sister?


902
01:13:28.032 --> 01:13:30.615
Promise easy
you's keep to yourself.


903
01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:32.860
Well, I promise.

904
01:13:34.371 --> 01:13:36.454
Okay, and now go pee.

905
01:13:45.341 --> 01:13:47.298
Can I keep you company?

906
01:13:47.635 --> 01:13:48.921
Sure, of course.

907
01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.885
So, what brings you over here?

908
01:13:58.604 --> 01:14:00.812
I come up here forever,
if I can.


909
01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.590
The sea has something
incredibly magical about it.


910
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:07.648
If you share your feelings with him,
it can heal you.


911
01:14:09.532 --> 01:14:11.740
I do not know,
what to feel.


912
01:14:13.035 --> 01:14:14.822
I'm proud of you.

913
01:14:16.038 --> 01:14:18.813
I'm just trying it,
doing the right thing.


914
01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:21.774
You did not have to say,
that you were in the hallway.


915
01:14:21.794 --> 01:14:24.161
So I thought
briefly about it, but ...


916
01:14:26.048 --> 01:14:29.212
You remember me
of someone I once knew.


917
01:14:30.594 --> 01:14:31.801
To whom?

918
01:14:33.848 --> 01:14:36.716
My friend.
- Where is he?


919
01:14:38.144 --> 01:14:40.431
He was a professional soldier, officer.

920
01:14:41.438 --> 01:14:44.505
He's not out
Afghanistan repatriated.


921
01:14:44.525 --> 01:14:45.857
I'm sorry.

922
01:14:47.945 --> 01:14:51.063
He has worked for,
what he firmly believed.


923
01:14:52.449 --> 01:14:54.657
I agree
a little in you.


924
01:14:55.995 --> 01:14:58.227
You're a good guy, Charlie.

925
01:14:58.247 --> 01:15:01.814
You did not deserve it,
Maggie treated you, not really.


926
01:15:01.834 --> 01:15:04.793
It is strange,
because I wanted to.


927
01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:08.046
But now it does me only suffering.

928
01:15:08.716 --> 01:15:15.054
Well, I think,
I was probably not the right person for them.


929
01:15:16.265 --> 01:15:18.247
Maybe you're the right person.

930
01:15:18.267 --> 01:15:21.556
Just as you said,
not for them.


931
01:15:29.236 --> 01:15:33.025
Want to have the, what you
thought the hot tub on the first night?


932
01:15:38.537 --> 01:15:41.496
What?
That to me almost explode the eggs?


933
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:11.665
Sorry.

934
01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:00.117
You're a great woman and you
not know how he will react.


935
01:18:00.137 --> 01:18:03.037
Do not you think,
you should give him a chance.


936
01:18:03.057 --> 01:18:05.014
The falls really hard for me.

937
01:18:05.684 --> 01:18:08.722
Also because my parents
have never married.


938
01:18:09.396 --> 01:18:14.357
So I was a love child. It's has
Love never existed when I was a little kid.


939
01:18:15.152 --> 01:18:18.969
And I have my, since
I was five, never seen again.


940
01:18:18.989 --> 01:18:22.448
So you can say,
I'm sensitive. - Wow.


941
01:18:23.994 --> 01:18:25.809
I've had no idea.

942
01:18:25.829 --> 01:18:29.197
I do not run so well with
a shield around at the stands on it's.


943
01:18:30.834 --> 01:18:36.153
Who creates it, between the lines
read, reads it, then:


944
01:18:36.173 --> 01:18:40.543
Gorgeous, intelligent dream woman
with a painful childhood.


945
01:18:41.178 --> 01:18:46.497
Sacrifices for their interests to
unplanned children of others raise.


946
01:18:46.517 --> 01:18:49.750
Hopes for the man of her dreams,
of her simply as traveling towards.


947
01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:52.836
And when he does that
and everything is not perfect,


948
01:18:52.856 --> 01:18:56.816
then she throws out everything
and get scared like a chicken during a thunderstorm.


949
01:19:03.492 --> 01:19:07.862
Not bad. - Thank you. - Were a cool
Candidate for "Got to Dance". - Really?


950
01:19:09.581 --> 01:19:11.105
What would you do then?

951
01:19:11.125 --> 01:19:13.899
Never done Miss "I've got it
and also do not know if I want "?


952
01:19:13.919 --> 01:19:16.957
Drag him to the altar
and myself believe it would be his?


953
01:19:19.675 --> 01:19:21.632
Yes, quite possible.
Sounds like me.


954
01:19:22.636 --> 01:19:26.120
Just as I know my Jenna,
showered your child with love,


955
01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:29.790
which she herself has not experienced.
Together with a man,


956
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:33.627
she loves above all else
and with whom she wants to build a family.


957
01:19:33.647 --> 01:19:36.839
Do you really not want you to him
at least should give a chance


958
01:19:36.859 --> 01:19:38.924
also to make a decision?

959
01:19:38.944 --> 01:19:41.732
Exactly would you
namely also expected.


960
01:19:46.118 --> 01:19:50.144
Thank you for you today all
look let. We are "Nylon Pink".


961
01:19:50.164 --> 01:19:51.655
Thank you!

962
01:19:52.374 --> 01:19:57.085
I want to now the organizers
Lola and Maggie ask on our stage.


963
01:20:06.221 --> 01:20:07.703
Hi guys.

964
01:20:07.723 --> 01:20:10.682
Hey!
Hi together, all right?


965
01:20:12.561 --> 01:20:15.210
Welcome to the

969
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:36.565
You are great!

970
01:20:36.585 --> 01:20:39.776
Yes, let us also walk
our knights in shining armor,


971
01:20:39.796 --> 01:20:44.416
the really very great people,
welcome: Dr. Spencer.


972
01:20:46.011 --> 01:20:47.451
Hi, Doctor!

973
01:20:47.471 --> 01:20:51.205
Thanks, guys, unfortunately, could
Stanley does not provide for the Party,


974
01:20:51.225 --> 01:20:55.292
but he told me that here as a sign
his appreciation given.


975
01:20:55.312 --> 01:20:56.678
Thank you from him!

976
01:20:58.649 --> 01:21:02.966
All right, dear friends,
enjoying the evening and although with "Nylon Pink"!


977
01:21:02.986 --> 01:21:04.443
Now it's celebrating!

978
01:21:21.421 --> 01:21:23.654
Johnny,
where have you been, tell me?


979
01:21:23.674 --> 01:21:26.532
I've been looking for you everywhere.
- You should only need to call back.


980
01:21:26.552 --> 01:21:28.992
That's what I want, yes, but my
Smartphone has fallen into the toilet.


981
01:21:29.012 --> 01:21:31.870
I've lost all my contacts.
I am fully screwed.


982
01:21:31.890 --> 01:21:35.258
A nightmare, man.
I'm so glad to have found you here.


983
01:21:35.644 --> 01:21:38.293
Charlie, that's Andy West.
Andy West, Charlie.


984
01:21:38.313 --> 01:21:40.771
Hi, Charlie, Andy West Coast.
Glad man.


985
01:21:43.193 --> 01:21:45.342
Okay.
Johnny, no shit, man.


986
01:21:45.362 --> 01:21:48.595
I told you that you are a white
Shirt attract shalt. You know what? - Yes.


987
01:21:48.615 --> 01:21:52.325
I have attached a photographer for you.
He has a few pictures of you shot.


988
01:21:53.078 --> 01:21:55.978
Great photos.
I told you clearly made an audition.


989
01:21:55.998 --> 01:21:58.272
Cool, thanks.
But how can I reach you now?


990
01:21:58.292 --> 01:22:00.774
No, I will contact with you.
All right, kid?


991
01:22:00.794 --> 01:22:03.944
And because you me
this great job have taught,


992
01:22:03.964 --> 01:22:07.173
you can not refuse me,
to dance with you.


993
01:22:08.677 --> 01:22:10.134
Sorry, Big Guy.

994
01:22:11.388 --> 01:22:13.370
The Lady dances with me.

995
01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:16.373
For each song,
all night.


996
01:22:16.393 --> 01:22:18.510
Is not that right, Maureen?

997
01:22:19.062 --> 01:22:21.019
Is that Maureen?

998
01:22:22.816 --> 01:22:26.800
I would really also
love dancing with you, but


999
01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:29.052
tonight I'm with Charlie here.

1000
01:22:29.072 --> 01:22:31.860
And when saying this,
then it will probably be so.


1001
01:22:32.826 --> 01:22:34.283
I ...

1002
01:22:36.747 --> 01:22:39.438
...congratulations,
my little friend.


1003
01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:40.915
Give me Five.

1004
01:22:41.627 --> 01:22:44.318
See you.
Beautiful evening.


1005
01:22:44.338 --> 01:22:46.612
All right, Johnny.
Now Enjoy this evening.


1006
01:22:46.632 --> 01:22:49.906
I need you tomorrow afternoon.
- Tomorrow in the afternoon. I'll be there.


1007
01:22:49.926 --> 01:22:52.784
Great. No shit.
I do not want you any longer zulabern.


1008
01:22:52.804 --> 01:22:55.704
I wish you a cool party.
- Okay, man. - See you tomorrow.


1009
01:22:55.724 --> 01:22:58.387
I am happy man.
- Okay, man. - Keep a stiff upper lip.


1010
01:23:09.821 --> 01:23:10.937
Hey people.

1011
01:23:12.824 --> 01:23:15.783
Hey people?
We have made us all right to worry.


1012
01:23:16.244 --> 01:23:17.768
Real, you have that?

1013
01:23:17.788 --> 01:23:23.409
Sorry, we are running late,
we had there still to clarify some things.


1014
01:23:24.294 --> 01:23:25.776
But cool party.

1015
01:23:25.796 --> 01:23:29.585
This is now the right time
for a small announcement.


1016
01:23:30.717 --> 01:23:32.083
We are engaged.

1017
01:23:42.479 --> 01:23:44.687
I'm looking really totally for you.

1018
01:24:10.257 --> 01:24:12.044
So, we ...

1019
01:24:14.302 --> 01:24:16.618
... Do not have
a lot to talk about.


1020
01:24:16.638 --> 01:24:19.756
We can not all our
Lifetime discuss things.


1021
01:24:20.392 --> 01:24:22.349
Do you find genuine,
which must be now?


1022
01:24:26.148 --> 01:24:28.105
No? No.

1023
01:24:34.281 --> 01:24:38.241
You're wasting too much time,
other people nervous with this thing.


1024
01:24:39.703 --> 01:24:41.569
With falling since but something better.

1025
01:24:42.414 --> 01:24:45.373
Without your stupid filming.

1026
01:24:55.135 --> 01:24:56.592
Good or?

1027
01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:01.256
Okay, okay.

1028
01:25:10.317 --> 01:25:11.524
Can I?

1029
01:25:13.403 --> 01:25:14.769
Can I?

1030
01:25:16.323 --> 01:25:18.531
Come on, pull it out.
- At it.


1031
01:25:20.619 --> 01:25:22.326
Do you need a ladder?

1032
01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:30.247
My lipstick looks good on you.

1033
01:25:32.547 --> 01:25:34.004
Toll how you laugh.

1034
01:25:35.383 --> 01:25:39.618
Except that you
beautiful and pretty are,


1035
01:25:39.638 --> 01:25:43.622
you're also honest.

1036
01:25:43.642 --> 01:25:46.625
Thank you.
- And caring and unselfish.


1037
01:25:46.645 --> 01:25:48.210
This is hard to find.

1038
01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:50.142
You mean to me really a lot.

1039
01:26:07.749 --> 01:26:09.206
That is fine.

1040
01:26:18.677 --> 01:26:20.213
How was it for you?

1041
01:26:20.595 --> 01:26:22.994
That was perfect,
I would say. - Yes?


1042
01:26:23.014 --> 01:26:25.413
Yes.
- Fancy a second round?


1043
01:26:25.433 --> 01:26:27.390
Now?
Okay, in five minutes.


1044
01:26:28.103 --> 01:26:29.890
I come back to it. 
- Okay.

1045
01:26:31.648 --> 01:26:35.382
Did not you also feel
that we are being watched?


1046
01:26:35.402 --> 01:26:38.861
So I do about me
no thoughts. Ignore the simple.


1047
01:26:41.992 --> 01:26:45.076
<i>Seventh day</i>

1048
01:26:53.879 --> 01:26:55.415
Have you seen Vincent?

1049
01:26:56.047 --> 01:26:58.029
Oh no.
Why what's going on?


1050
01:26:58.049 --> 01:27:00.198
Nothing at all. I'm just...

1051
01:27:00.218 --> 01:27:03.535
I'm just woke up and he was gone.
I do not know where he is.


1052
01:27:03.555 --> 01:27:06.454
There is still no one lost.
The dive again soon.


1053
01:27:06.474 --> 01:27:08.511
How's me this morning?

1054
01:27:09.644 --> 01:27:11.681
So what of damned cool!

1055
01:27:12.689 --> 01:27:15.755
Does anyone what to feed?
I die of hunger.


1056
01:27:15.775 --> 01:27:19.815
Now I want biscuits or burgers,
Pizza, donuts, pancakes ...


1057
01:27:21.031 --> 01:27:22.988
A sandwich would be okay.

1058
01:27:23.408 --> 01:27:25.365
Oh, save me. Thank you.

1059
01:27:26.202 --> 01:27:29.161
Your noise you can
sleep on the plane. Coffee?


1060
01:27:30.332 --> 01:27:32.105
Good morning people.

1061
01:27:32.125 --> 01:27:34.024
Do you know where Vincent is?

1062
01:27:34.044 --> 01:27:36.568
Honestly, yes.
You might like to get out.


1063
01:27:36.588 --> 01:27:38.295
Because what awaits you.

1064
01:29:05.635 --> 01:29:08.002
Not too sparingly.

1065
01:29:09.639 --> 01:29:11.596
Sorry, but now I am a man.

1066
01:29:25.071 --> 01:29:27.154
<i>END</i>

1067
01:29:42.839 --> 01:29:44.546
Are you laughing because I rumgefurzt?

1068
01:29:50.889 --> 01:29:54.039
Come at once
a stranger to me and


1069
01:29:54.059 --> 01:29:58.543
offers me
To be a movie star or television star.


1070
01:29:58.563 --> 01:30:00.555
So what experienced before?
- Sometimes it.


1071
01:30:01.691 --> 01:30:05.651
Was that a guy or a woman?
- It was ... It was a guy.


1072
01:30:06.154 --> 01:30:07.611
Has he looked like?

1073
01:30:09.491 --> 01:30:12.609
So you're at a turning point.
I see immediately.


1074
01:30:17.290 --> 01:30:18.906
Is that funny?

1075
01:30:21.878 --> 01:30:24.837
Yeah, so like I said,
I'm at a turning point.


1076
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:28.916
Me too.

1077
01:30:29.636 --> 01:30:31.753
Did he angegrabscht your willy?

1078
01:30:33.515 --> 01:30:35.632
Did he angegrabscht your willy?

1079
01:30:36.643 --> 01:30:38.259
Okay.

1080
01:30:38.561 --> 01:30:41.961
Many girls I made
television know are from Malibu.


1081
01:30:41.981 --> 01:30:43.768
I can hardly wait.

1082
01:30:44.275 --> 01:30:46.983
I'm doing a little free memory, oh yes.

1083
01:30:47.445 --> 01:30:48.652
Yes, Mom?

1084
01:30:49.405 --> 01:30:56.369
No no. No, I do Photos
of birds and squirrels.


1085
01:30:57.622 --> 01:31:00.911
No, not from the birds.
From birds. Yes.


1086
01:31:01.543 --> 01:31:03.500
Mom, NE!

1087
01:31:04.796 --> 01:31:07.664
Why did Dad say,
that I am fully behämmert?


1088
01:31:09.384 --> 01:31:12.951
He said, I am behämmert,
because I'm out crawled out of you!


1089
01:31:12.971 --> 01:31:16.621
I won a trip to Malibu
and am now times for a week away!


1090
01:31:16.641 --> 01:31:18.790
May I then
but come back,


1091
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:22.961
I do not suppose that I
a meet, with which I draw together.


1092
01:31:22.981 --> 01:31:26.850
Oh please,
I know I'm behämmert.


1093
01:31:27.569 --> 01:31:29.276
No, not you.

1094
01:31:29.737 --> 01:31:33.526
But, you're behämmert.
Damn it, I hate you.


1095
01:31:34.117 --> 01:31:38.768
Hey, no! I had not the interim
Available, I would have a job, right?


1096
01:31:38.788 --> 01:31:42.498
You had me may not blow the whistle.
What is that?


1097
01:31:43.293 --> 01:31:45.608
No, you're behämmert!

1098
01:31:45.628 --> 01:31:49.445
Mom, that would have really cool for
I should be and what are you doing?


1099
01:31:49.465 --> 01:31:53.800
You've ruined everything, because you think,
that I would have messed up your life, man.


1100
01:31:55.763 --> 01:31:57.162
However, I would!

1101
01:31:57.182 --> 01:31:59.831
Anyway, I would
marry a whore.


1102
01:31:59.851 --> 01:32:02.000
I would bring them here.

1103
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:05.670
And Grandma, I would imagine they also.
The still behämmerter.


1104
01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:08.103
I'm sorry,
I should not have said.


1105
01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:12.260
Because of you I always say things,
I do not mean.


1106
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.648
I mean you have so,
but you understand it anyway wrong.


1107
01:32:16.993 --> 01:32:21.144
You know what? I turn now easy
a cool Suicide Video, Mom.


1108
01:32:21.164 --> 01:32:22.530
Hi guys!

1109
01:32:26.169 --> 01:32:28.411
I know you're the
Now do not believe.


1110
01:32:28.796 --> 01:32:32.947
But yet, I'll leave you.
Goodbye forever.


1111
01:32:32.967 --> 01:32:35.116
Actually, I wanted
yes only a week away,


1112
01:32:35.136 --> 01:32:38.161
but if I find something cooler,
then you've done it.


1113
01:32:38.181 --> 01:32:39.996
Even if it is hell.

1114
01:32:40.016 --> 01:32:42.884
Exactly!
I live in hell anyway, Mom!


1115
01:32:43.645 --> 01:32:45.102
And with you!
