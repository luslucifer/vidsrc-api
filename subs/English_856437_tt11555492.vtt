00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.516
O fig pickers

2
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.558
Let the figs be on the tree

3
00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:20.058
Pick them and fail to eat them

4
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:24.100
And you will have to deal with me

5
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:28.641
NOVEL 
- SHAIMA HASSAN

6
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:32.808
-We're late. The sheikh will punish us.
-Let's go.


7
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.808
Farha.

8
00:01:41.016 --> 00:01:43.558
-Let's go.
-Hurry up.


9
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.266
-Come on.
-Hurry!


10
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.975
Come on, Farha.

11
00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:56.975
-Come on.
-Faster!


12
00:02:23.183 --> 00:02:29.683
FARHA

13
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.391
PALESTINE, 1948

14
00:02:37.975 --> 00:02:40.183
"It doesn't matter
if you don't support him, for Allah did


15
00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:43.558
when the disbelievers drove him out
and he was only one of two


16
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:48.100
while they both were in the cave,
he reassured his companion, don't worry--


17
00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:51.058
"He reassured his companion,
'Don't worry'."


18
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:54.850
"He reassured his companion,
Don't worry; Allah is certainly with us.'"


19
00:02:55.558 --> 00:02:58.808
"So Allah sent down His serenity
upon the Prophet,


20
00:02:58.891 --> 00:03:01.183
and supported him with forces
you did not see.


21
00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:05.266
-"And made those…"
-"And made the word…"


22
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.433
"And made the word of the disbelievers…

23
00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:12.641
of the disbelievers…

24
00:03:14.558 --> 00:03:15.808
lowest…

25
00:03:15.891 --> 00:03:17.266
lowest,

26
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.016
while the Word of Allah is supreme."

27
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.016
"And Allah is Almighty, All
-Wise."

28
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.975
"True are the words
of Allah the Almighty."


29
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:29.683
I'm dismissing you early today, girls.

30
00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:31.225
As you know,

31
00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:33.808
tomorrow is Suad's bridal shower.

32
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.475
I wish you all the same thing.

33
00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:41.641
I wish we will have a school for girls
in the village, just like the boys.


34
00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:45.016
You may leave.

35
00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:57.433
-How are you, sweetie?
-I'm well.


36
00:03:58.308 --> 00:04:01.225
Send my regards to the mayor.
I'll see him later.


37
00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:02.225
Go on, child.

38
00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.683
-Don't go far from the house.
-Okay.


39
00:04:19.183 --> 00:04:21.308
I still can't believe you're here.

40
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.350
-Me neither. I wish I lived here.

41
00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:29.391
How could someone living the city
wish to live here?


42
00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:32.183
What's in the village? 
A couple of sheep?

43
00:04:34.058 --> 00:04:37.183
It has trees, birds…

44
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:40.100
And you.

45
00:04:43.225 --> 00:04:44.433
Listen.

46
00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:49.725
You can't move here
when I get lucky and move to the city.


47
00:04:49.808 --> 00:04:52.683
I will kill you. I'm serious.

48
00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:58.600
Imagine that I'd go to the city,
and go to school.


49
00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:04.850
I'd have a backpack, workbooks, pens…

50
00:05:06.683 --> 00:05:10.225
We'd go to school together by car.

51
00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:16.766
Speaking of which,
what did your dad decide?


52
00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:21.641
I don't know yet. 
I'll know today.

53
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.141
-Aren't those the British soldiers?
-It looks like it.


54
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.266
Come on! Get out of here!

55
00:05:39.058 --> 00:05:42.391
-What's "get out of here" in English?
-I don't know. Maybe "goodbye."


56
00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:43.350
What?

57
00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:53.266
Look at what you did!
Even when you are leaving?


58
00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:05.266
-Get out of here! Leave!
-Leave!


59
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.350
-Leave and never come back.
-Leave!


60
00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:10.891
-Wait for me!
-Leave!


61
00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:13.766
-Wait for me!
-Leave!


62
00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:17.225
Wait for me!

63
00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:24.183
I hit the British soldier.

64
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.433
What weapons and what armed men?

65
00:06:32.516 --> 00:06:36.016
You speak as if we have
a fully equipped army


66
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.016
with cannons, tanks, and planes.

67
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.975
We just have a handful of rusty guns

68
00:06:44.058 --> 00:06:47.225
and defective bullets,
some of which are even filled with wax.


69
00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:54.600
Welcome, Farha.

70
00:06:55.266 --> 00:06:57.183
What a beauty!

71
00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:00.850
I wouldn't have recognized you
in the street.


72
00:07:00.933 --> 00:07:02.141
How are you, Uncle?

73
00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:04.641
All better now that I've seen you.

74
00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:08.391
See? Farha has grown
and it's time to marry her off.


75
00:07:08.475 --> 00:07:11.516
Come on, man!
She's still too young to get married.


76
00:07:12.183 --> 00:07:13.391
Dad, I want to remind you.

77
00:07:14.975 --> 00:07:17.933
Next week is the deadline
for enrolling at school.


78
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.933
I told you now is not the time.

79
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.016
Serve your uncle.

80
00:07:29.683 --> 00:07:30.975
Thank you.

81
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.100
Thank you. Put it down, sweetie.
I'll drink in a bit.


82
00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:46.558
Anyway, when you think of it,

83
00:07:47.891 --> 00:07:50.891
the military power of the…

84
00:07:56.975 --> 00:08:00.641
-May you always have a welcoming home.
-Thank you, Abu Al Waleed.


85
00:08:00.725 --> 00:08:01.808
Sameeha?

86
00:08:03.058 --> 00:08:05.933
-Sameeha? I'm calling you.
-Coming!


87
00:08:06.016 --> 00:08:08.641
Hurry up and go with your brother
before the dark.


88
00:08:08.725 --> 00:08:10.183
Come on, sister. Hurry up.

89
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.850
We did not show you
proper hospitality yet, Abu Al Waleed.


90
00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:21.641
Don't say that, Abu Farha.
Always so generous and welcoming.


91
00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:25.975
-Thank you.
-I don't like anyone else's company.


92
00:08:26.058 --> 00:08:28.475
But you know how things are.
Mother is sick.


93
00:08:28.558 --> 00:08:32.141
We want to get back to her quickly
and the roads are not safe.


94
00:08:32.225 --> 00:08:34.516
We want to get there before dark.

95
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.266
I wish your mother a speedy recovery.

96
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.016
And visit more often.
Once every two months is not enough.


97
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.391
God willing.

98
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:46.141
And listen,

99
00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:49.100
take it easy on your daughter.

100
00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:55.016
What is the problem if she wants to learn?

101
00:08:56.975 --> 00:09:00.725
There is no harm in that.
Is she asking for the impossible?


102
00:09:00.808 --> 00:09:02.975
Knowledge in youth is wisdom in age.

103
00:09:03.058 --> 00:09:06.475
Abu Al Waleed.

104
00:09:06.558 --> 00:09:09.433
Do you want me
to go against the norms?

105
00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:13.558
Let me find her a suitor
who will take care of her in these times.


106
00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:16.225
You're the only one who encourages her.

107
00:09:16.308 --> 00:09:18.016
She's already stubborn as it is.

108
00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:25.225
Listen. The paper I got you includes
the enrollment form to the city school.


109
00:09:25.308 --> 00:09:27.558
-What are you saying, man?
-Hear me out.


110
00:09:27.641 --> 00:09:31.891
Think about it, but not for long.
The enrollment period is limited.


111
00:09:33.058 --> 00:09:36.266
I'll take care of her in the city
as if she was my daughter.


112
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.558
That's Farha. She's reliable.

113
00:09:40.183 --> 00:09:41.433
So come on, say yes.

114
00:09:41.516 --> 00:09:43.975
-Hello, sister.
-I'm ready, brother.


115
00:09:44.058 --> 00:09:46.975
-Give me your bindle.
-You're my cousin,


116
00:09:47.058 --> 00:09:50.225
and I cherish you and respect
your words. You know that.


117
00:09:50.308 --> 00:09:52.558
-God bless you.
-I'll think about it.


118
00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:53.725
God willing.

119
00:09:54.725 --> 00:09:57.516
-Take care of yourself and of Farha.
-Where is Farha? Farha?


120
00:09:58.516 --> 00:09:59.975
Where are you, Farha?

121
00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:02.391
Come here, dear.

122
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.141
-I'll come back soon.
-Hey.


123
00:10:08.933 --> 00:10:11.600
Take care of your father, okay?

124
00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:13.766
Everything will be okay.

125
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.141
Okay then. Take care.

126
00:10:17.225 --> 00:10:19.891
-Peace be with you.
-Go with the protection of God.


127
00:10:19.975 --> 00:10:22.350
I'll be back soon.

128
00:10:23.225 --> 00:10:26.975
-Next time, we will play backgammon.
-You seem to like losing.


129
00:10:28.766 --> 00:10:32.975
-All right. See you later.
-Godspeed.


130
00:10:33.058 --> 00:10:34.975
-Be safe.
-Take care on the road.


131
00:10:35.058 --> 00:10:36.100
We will.

132
00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:08.475
-That's your place. You honor us.
-Thank you.


133
00:11:08.558 --> 00:11:11.933
Anyway, I need your advice too.

134
00:11:13.516 --> 00:11:17.391
Farha is smart and loves to learn.

135
00:11:18.266 --> 00:11:21.475
I'm thinking about sending her
to the city…


136
00:11:21.558 --> 00:11:23.891
-No, Abu Farha.
-…to learn,


137
00:11:23.975 --> 00:11:26.350
because I don't want to disappoint her.

138
00:11:26.433 --> 00:11:29.683
You taught her and know her
as well as I do, if not better.


139
00:11:29.766 --> 00:11:31.641
Mayor!

140
00:11:31.725 --> 00:11:35.683
We've talked about this. Your daughter
should stay with you in these times.


141
00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:37.100
Keep your daughter with you.

142
00:11:37.183 --> 00:11:39.558
-The situation is volatile.
-I hear you.


143
00:11:39.641 --> 00:11:43.266
And what learning are you talking about?

144
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.933
She learned the Quran.
What else is there to learn?


145
00:11:53.016 --> 00:11:56.891
Geography, history, math, and English.

146
00:11:58.141 --> 00:11:59.391
Farha!

147
00:12:02.391 --> 00:12:03.933
How come she's so stubborn?

148
00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:08.808
Who is it?

149
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:11.225
Open the door, Farha. It's Nasser.

150
00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:16.100
-Yes?
-How are you, Farha?


151
00:12:16.183 --> 00:12:17.391
I'm good.

152
00:12:17.475 --> 00:12:21.475
Here. Mom sent this casserole,
until your stepmom comes back.


153
00:12:22.225 --> 00:12:24.100
-Okay.
-Wait.


154
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.433
So you know nothing about cooking?

155
00:12:28.308 --> 00:12:29.516
No, I don't.

156
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.433
I can't see.

157
00:12:40.683 --> 00:12:42.016
I can't see anything.

158
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:42.308
O beautiful bride, beautiful like the moon

159
00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:44.475
-Did you have fun?
-A lot of fun.


160
00:13:47.933 --> 00:13:50.600
O Suad, prettiest of them all

161
00:13:50.683 --> 00:13:52.725
Mohammad you shall wed

162
00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:55.308
Isn't that Nasser?

163
00:13:56.308 --> 00:13:57.975
Yes. Let's go.

164
00:14:06.183 --> 00:14:09.016
What were you talking about
with my uncle and his son?


165
00:14:16.058 --> 00:14:17.016
Dad.

166
00:14:20.725 --> 00:14:21.766
Dad!

167
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.100
-Abu Fahad?
-Hello, mayor.


168
00:14:24.183 --> 00:14:25.975
-How is it going?
-God bless you.


169
00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:33.475
What were you talking about
with my uncle and his son?


170
00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:36.516
You mean your cousin.

171
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.100
Here you go.

172
00:14:46.183 --> 00:14:48.433
What's wrong with your cousin Nasser?

173
00:14:50.808 --> 00:14:52.058
What's wrong with him?

174
00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:56.183
And why won't you marry
like the rest of the girls in the village?


175
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.266
I don't want to get married.

176
00:14:59.141 --> 00:15:00.266
What are you saying?

177
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:03.141
You need to be disciplined
for saying that.


178
00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:05.100
Don't move, girl!

179
00:15:05.183 --> 00:15:07.308
Shame on you!

180
00:15:07.391 --> 00:15:10.141
Is that a way to talk to your father?

181
00:15:11.766 --> 00:15:15.891
Your father who raised you
and now brought you the enrollment form


182
00:15:17.016 --> 00:15:19.350
so you can complete your studies
in the city.


183
00:15:21.016 --> 00:15:21.975
For real, Dad?

184
00:15:35.058 --> 00:15:36.308
Are you serious?

185
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:51.808
Listen…

186
00:15:53.808 --> 00:15:57.225
-Farha is going to the city school
-Girl!


187
00:15:57.308 --> 00:16:00.266
-Fareeda, get the party started
-Don't make a scene. Get down.


188
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.641
Get down.

189
00:16:02.225 --> 00:16:05.600
And the mayor is the best father
in whole the village


190
00:16:06.225 --> 00:16:08.766
What should I do with this girl?

191
00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:54.516
-Here you go.
-Thank you.


192
00:17:07.225 --> 00:17:10.600
Technically, in the middle regions

193
00:17:10.683 --> 00:17:14.350
and in the South,
there are no Palestinian villages left.


194
00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:18.225
All villagers have been displaced.

195
00:17:18.308 --> 00:17:21.433
They are now refugees in other regions.

196
00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:27.266
So, ever since someone from my family,
the Jalmood family, was elected mayor,


197
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.100
all that mattered to us
is preserving the village,


198
00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:33.308
and the safety of its inhabitants.

199
00:17:35.016 --> 00:17:37.350
So, is that your final decision, mayor?

200
00:17:37.433 --> 00:17:40.433
You heard me.

201
00:17:40.516 --> 00:17:45.641
Now, you had your tea and coffee,
and we respect you tremendously.


202
00:17:45.725 --> 00:17:47.975
Come on, guys. We have no time to lose.

203
00:17:49.808 --> 00:17:52.933
Abu Nemr, listen to me.

204
00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:58.391
I received promises,

205
00:17:58.475 --> 00:18:02.808
and I heard
that the Arab forces will support us


206
00:18:02.891 --> 00:18:04.975
by sending ammunition and soldiers.

207
00:18:05.058 --> 00:18:06.808
We better wait.

208
00:18:06.891 --> 00:18:11.225
When we receive the support,
I will be at the forefront of the army.


209
00:18:11.308 --> 00:18:13.100
I will be the first to fight.

210
00:18:13.183 --> 00:18:16.808
This is not a truce.
They are stalling for time.


211
00:18:16.891 --> 00:18:19.516
-In the end, your land will turn to ash.
-Listen, Son.


212
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.391
I did not expect that you will
refuse to help us. Goodbye.


213
00:18:31.183 --> 00:18:33.808
I hope that your forces
will arrive fast, Abu Farha.


214
00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:06.683
FARHA KAMEL JALMOOD
GRADE SIX


215
00:19:12.933 --> 00:19:13.975
Dad?

216
00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:25.141
Dad?

217
00:19:54.308 --> 00:19:58.683
Farha? Why are you awake so early?

218
00:20:12.933 --> 00:20:14.516
Dad, what are you doing?

219
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.641
I am plastering the cracks.

220
00:20:22.725 --> 00:20:26.600
Plaster glues the stones together.

221
00:20:29.391 --> 00:20:30.975
Don't you want to sleep?

222
00:20:50.808 --> 00:20:53.975
I forgot to tell you. Dad said yes.

223
00:20:57.433 --> 00:21:01.391
-Really? Is it confirmed?
-Yes.


224
00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.058
I can't believe it.

225
00:21:10.933 --> 00:21:14.183
-Is there something upsetting you?
-No, nothing.


226
00:21:15.933 --> 00:21:17.183
You don't look happy.

227
00:21:18.516 --> 00:21:20.891
Of course I'm happy.

228
00:21:23.016 --> 00:21:24.683
But I'm thinking of my father.

229
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.683
I can't leave him.

230
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:30.433
That's all.

231
00:21:33.266 --> 00:21:34.433
But he's not alone.

232
00:21:45.933 --> 00:21:49.350
-I know why you're upset.
-Why?


233
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.350
-You lost the suitor.
-I'm warning you!


234
00:21:55.266 --> 00:21:56.683
Enough!

235
00:22:00.975 --> 00:22:04.266
Enough! No, stop! 
I will shut up.

236
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.725
But don't worry. 
He'll wait for you.

237
00:22:11.308 --> 00:22:15.516
-Fareeda!
-No, fine. I'll stop. Cut it out.


238
00:22:20.433 --> 00:22:22.016
Do you know what I've decided?

239
00:22:25.683 --> 00:22:30.100
When I finish my studies in the city,
I want to become a teacher.


240
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.850
I will open a school here,

241
00:22:34.225 --> 00:22:35.641
just for girls.

242
00:22:38.433 --> 00:22:42.433
When I grow up, 
I want to become…

243
00:23:00.933 --> 00:23:05.016
Save your women and children
from the blood pool


244
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.225
while you still can.

245
00:23:07.308 --> 00:23:09.933
Oh, God!!

246
00:23:15.766 --> 00:23:19.725
-Go! Get out of here!
-God, spare your people!


247
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.975
Come on, run!

248
00:23:27.058 --> 00:23:33.100
Head to the northern exit of the village
while it is still open.


249
00:23:35.558 --> 00:23:37.308
-Are you hurt?
-No.


250
00:23:37.391 --> 00:23:39.433
Where were you? 
Let's get out of here.

251
00:23:40.225 --> 00:23:42.475
Allah is Sufficient!
Most Excellent is He in Whom we trust!


252
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.975
Fareeda! Are you okay, Fareeda?

253
00:23:48.058 --> 00:23:50.975
-Let's go. There is no time. Hurry.
-Fareeda!


254
00:23:51.058 --> 00:23:53.308
-Come on. Get in the car.
-Where is Dad?


255
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:55.766
-Hurry up, Hassan. Take!
-To Khallat Taweel.


256
00:23:55.850 --> 00:24:01.183
-Have you seen my dad?
-We'll look for him. Get in, Farha.


257
00:24:01.266 --> 00:24:02.850
Get in. Where are you going?

258
00:24:04.016 --> 00:24:08.183
Where are you going, child?
Where to? Masoud?


259
00:24:10.475 --> 00:24:13.266
I entrust you with my daughter, Masoud.

260
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.600
-Take her in the car.
-You heard your dad.


261
00:24:15.683 --> 00:24:17.766
-Leave this place. Go!
-No, Dad.


262
00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:22.516
-Dad, where will you go?
-Get in the car. Leave!


263
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.016
Are you okay, Farha?

264
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.475
-Where are they getting in from?
-They surrounded us from all sides.


265
00:24:27.558 --> 00:24:30.391
The northern exit is the only one left.
Head North.


266
00:24:30.475 --> 00:24:34.308
Go to Khallat Taweel. 
I will follow you.

267
00:24:34.391 --> 00:24:35.683
I won't leave you here.

268
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.475
I'll get them to safety
and meet the mayors


269
00:24:38.558 --> 00:24:40.350
to see what I can do,
then I will come back.


270
00:24:42.016 --> 00:24:43.058
Kamel!

271
00:25:05.933 --> 00:25:08.933
-Watch out!
-Calm down.


272
00:25:33.683 --> 00:25:36.433
-Uncle! Stop!
-There is no time, Farha.


273
00:25:36.516 --> 00:25:38.600
-Stop!
-Wait!


274
00:25:40.016 --> 00:25:41.225
-Farha!
-Farha, wait!


275
00:25:41.308 --> 00:25:43.641
-I have to stay with my dad.
-Farha!


276
00:25:44.808 --> 00:25:48.933
-Oh, God!!
-Take the women.


277
00:25:49.016 --> 00:25:50.308
Farha!

278
00:25:55.141 --> 00:25:57.016
-Fareeda?
-Farha!


279
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.016
-Come here! Where are you going? Get in.
-Farha!


280
00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:21.016
Farha!

281
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:36.850
Why did you come back?

282
00:26:55.391 --> 00:26:58.350
-Dad?
-Farha.


283
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:05.058
-Dad, what is this?
-The village has fallen.


284
00:27:05.141 --> 00:27:08.516
-Where will we go?
-Oh, God!!


285
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.266
What will we do now, Dad?

286
00:27:12.016 --> 00:27:15.391
What are you doing, Dad?
Will we go to Fareeda's?


287
00:27:15.475 --> 00:27:19.391
Fareeda? I told you to go
with Masoud and you refused.


288
00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:24.850
Come on.

289
00:27:24.933 --> 00:27:26.350
Dad, will we go to the city?

290
00:27:30.516 --> 00:27:33.516
-Nasser!
-Get out!


291
00:27:35.558 --> 00:27:37.100
Where will we go now?

292
00:27:40.391 --> 00:27:43.891
Why didn't you listen to me? Why?

293
00:27:48.058 --> 00:27:50.350
Come with me.

294
00:27:50.433 --> 00:27:52.058
Dad, where will we go?

295
00:28:00.266 --> 00:28:02.725
There is no time to eat, Dad.
We have to leave.


296
00:28:07.266 --> 00:28:11.016
-We have to catch up with them.
-Get in and wait for me.


297
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.850
-No!
-I will come back to get you.


298
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.058
-Do you understand?
-Let me stay with you.


299
00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:18.641
-Stay with me where?
-Dad, I want to stay with you.


300
00:28:18.725 --> 00:28:20.433
-Stay with me where?
-Dad!


301
00:28:20.516 --> 00:28:23.766
-I won't say it again. Listen to me.
-No, Dad!


302
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.975
-Come on. Hurry up. Let's go.
-Dad, I want to stay with you.


303
00:28:27.058 --> 00:28:30.975
I will come back to get you.
Don't be scared. There is no time.


304
00:28:31.058 --> 00:28:33.975
-Listen to me.
-Dad…


305
00:28:34.058 --> 00:28:36.850
-This is the safest place for you.
-Then stay with me.


306
00:28:36.933 --> 00:28:39.725
Stay with you where?
I have to be with the people.


307
00:28:40.308 --> 00:28:41.975
The soldiers entered the village.

308
00:28:42.683 --> 00:28:43.516
Do you get it?

309
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.308
-No, Dad.
-Calm down.


310
00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:49.391
Listen. Wait for me here
and I will come back to get you.


311
00:28:49.475 --> 00:28:52.225
Don't be scared. 
I won't be long.

312
00:29:03.058 --> 00:29:04.558
Keep this.

313
00:29:47.266 --> 00:29:49.100
Did you hear me, child?

314
00:29:49.183 --> 00:29:51.683
-Dad!
-I won't leave you.


315
00:29:54.891 --> 00:29:56.266
Dad, stay with me.

316
00:29:57.183 --> 00:29:58.266
Farha…

317
00:30:00.433 --> 00:30:01.808
I will be back, child.

318
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.183
Stay inside.

319
00:30:07.225 --> 00:30:08.475
Don't be scared.

320
00:32:09.516 --> 00:32:10.433
Dad?

321
00:35:25.016 --> 00:35:26.016
Dad?

322
00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:10.433
TO MY DEAR FRIEND FARHA
FROM FAREEDA


323
00:37:25.766 --> 00:37:26.891
Dad?

324
00:38:04.058 --> 00:38:05.641
Get out of here!

325
00:38:18.266 --> 00:38:19.683
Get out! Come on. Out!

326
00:38:25.266 --> 00:38:27.266
Take the boy and leave.

327
00:38:28.475 --> 00:38:30.475
I said take the boy and go.

328
00:49:44.225 --> 00:49:49.350
Farha is going to the city school

329
00:49:52.641 --> 00:49:59.183
Fareeda, get the party started

330
00:50:02.225 --> 00:50:03.516
Oh joy

331
00:50:37.725 --> 00:50:38.766
Come this way.

332
00:50:43.475 --> 00:50:45.933
This is a good place. Come.

333
00:50:49.225 --> 00:50:53.183
-Lower your voice.
-The pain is too much.


334
00:50:55.725 --> 00:50:57.350
Sit here.

335
00:51:12.266 --> 00:51:15.141
Give her some water. It's okay.

336
00:51:15.225 --> 00:51:16.975
Pray. Come on.

337
00:51:17.058 --> 00:51:18.933
Oh, God.

338
00:51:20.475 --> 00:51:23.141
Slowly. Come on.

339
00:51:24.266 --> 00:51:25.975
Lower your voice.

340
00:51:29.058 --> 00:51:32.183
The head is out. It's okay. 
A little more.

341
00:51:32.266 --> 00:51:33.516
A little more.

342
00:51:34.308 --> 00:51:35.350
A little more.

343
00:51:37.766 --> 00:51:39.308
He's out.

344
00:51:42.725 --> 00:51:45.266
A boy. It's Mohammed.

345
00:51:47.558 --> 00:51:50.475
Congratulations, Abu Mohammed.
Congratulations!


346
00:51:52.266 --> 00:51:53.475
Give me a stone.

347
00:52:12.058 --> 00:52:13.975
Allah is the greatest.

348
00:52:14.058 --> 00:52:16.600
I bear witness that
there is no god but Allah.


349
00:52:16.683 --> 00:52:18.600
I bear witness that
Muhammad is His Messenger.


350
00:52:19.141 --> 00:52:21.683
Come to prayer. 
Come to prosperity.

351
00:52:21.766 --> 00:52:24.891
Allah is the greatest.
There is no god but Allah.


352
00:52:28.975 --> 00:52:32.016
Take your brother, child.

353
00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:59.516
Abu Mohammed?

354
00:53:15.558 --> 00:53:17.016
Abu Mohammed?

355
00:53:24.683 --> 00:53:25.766
I'm here.

356
00:53:29.141 --> 00:53:31.516
Who are you? What are you doing here?

357
00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.975
My dad left me here.

358
00:53:33.058 --> 00:53:35.058
He said he'll be back,
but he hasn't returned.


359
00:53:35.141 --> 00:53:36.516
I'm worried about him.

360
00:53:37.225 --> 00:53:40.016
Get me out of here. 
The door is there.

361
00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.600
All right. Okay.

362
00:53:49.975 --> 00:53:51.391
Stand back.

363
00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.891
Leave your houses.

364
00:54:17.975 --> 00:54:20.016
Lower your voice. 
Don't make a sound.

365
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.975
Those who do not leave now
will be killed in their houses.


366
00:54:23.058 --> 00:54:24.641
Where are you, Abu Mohammed?

367
00:54:26.808 --> 00:54:28.766
Don't make any noise. 
Hide the girls.

368
00:54:33.516 --> 00:54:37.558
Get out with your children and women now.

369
00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:40.725
Go and hide on the roof.
Hurry up. To the roof.


370
00:54:40.808 --> 00:54:43.641
Get out or get killed.

371
00:54:47.766 --> 00:54:50.266
Get out or get killed in your houses.

372
00:55:00.475 --> 00:55:02.933
Don't move. I'm talking to you.

373
00:55:04.058 --> 00:55:05.141
Come here.

374
00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:10.725
Come here.

375
00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:19.558
Hands up.

376
00:55:28.433 --> 00:55:30.266
-What is this?
-These are my papers?


377
00:55:37.141 --> 00:55:39.016
-There is nothing there.
-Turn around.


378
00:55:41.683 --> 00:55:42.558
Turn around!

379
00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:44.725
Do you know him?

380
00:55:46.391 --> 00:55:50.308
No. He's from another village.
He's not a fighter.


381
00:55:50.391 --> 00:55:51.891
Shut up!

382
00:55:51.975 --> 00:55:54.850
Sir, he came out through that door.

383
00:56:01.516 --> 00:56:02.391
Okay.

384
00:56:03.766 --> 00:56:05.891
-Search the house.
-Yes, sir.


385
00:56:05.975 --> 00:56:07.641
You. Walk.

386
00:56:07.725 --> 00:56:11.225
-There is nothing here.
-Come on.


387
00:56:11.308 --> 00:56:13.808
-I'm telling you there is nothing here.
-Come on.


388
00:56:14.683 --> 00:56:16.725
-I'm just passing by.
-Move.


389
00:56:16.808 --> 00:56:18.683
I'm telling you, 
I'm just passing by.

390
00:56:21.225 --> 00:56:24.016
-Come on. Move!
-I don't live here. I'm just passing by.


391
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.683
I stopped to drink water.

392
00:56:25.766 --> 00:56:28.600
Move. Come on.

393
00:56:31.933 --> 00:56:33.850
-There is no one here.
-Move.


394
00:56:33.933 --> 00:56:35.891
-I just stopped for water.
-Move.


395
00:56:35.975 --> 00:56:39.058
-I don't know who's house this is.
-Come on.


396
00:56:40.558 --> 00:56:43.933
Stand here! Hands up!

397
00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:00.600
What's your name?

398
00:57:01.391 --> 00:57:04.766
My name is Saleh. 
I'm not from here.

399
00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:07.891
I'm from Asseera.

400
00:57:07.975 --> 00:57:12.141
I was passing by
and came inside to quench my thirst.


401
00:57:36.558 --> 00:57:37.600
What's this?

402
00:57:44.016 --> 00:57:47.058
What's this? Where do you hide your guns?

403
00:57:47.558 --> 00:57:48.891
I told you I don't know.

404
00:58:27.766 --> 00:58:31.141
You came back for the weapons
and you know where they are.


405
00:58:34.475 --> 00:58:37.100
-Search the house.
-Yes, sir.


406
00:58:57.933 --> 00:58:59.350
I didn't find anything, sir.

407
00:59:00.391 --> 00:59:02.266
-Nothing.
-There is nothing here.


408
00:59:42.225 --> 00:59:48.350
Wait. Look at what I found.

409
00:59:49.766 --> 00:59:53.850
-Let her go.
-Stop! Don't move.


410
00:59:54.975 --> 00:59:57.641
-Leave the women out of this.
-Stop!


411
00:59:58.141 --> 01:00:00.891
-Search her.
-Yes, sir.


412
01:00:25.766 --> 01:00:27.183
Are you pregnant?

413
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:48.100
-The same hiding place.
-Enough!


414
01:00:53.558 --> 01:00:54.641
Key!

415
01:01:02.933 --> 01:01:04.600
Keep it as a souvenir.

416
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:14.141
Let her be, you shameless man!

417
01:01:23.308 --> 01:01:26.016
-Boy or girl?
-Girl.


418
01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:29.558
-Boy.
-It sure looks like a boy.


419
01:01:32.975 --> 01:01:36.933
-I think it's boy too.
-What is he saying?


420
01:01:37.016 --> 01:01:39.600
What do you think? Boy or girl?

421
01:01:39.683 --> 01:01:41.933
-Stop!
-You have no shame!


422
01:01:42.016 --> 01:01:45.891
-Wait! She's a woman.
-Don't be scared, Mayssar.


423
01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:49.350
She's just a woman.

424
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.933
-Let them be!
-Come on! Move!


425
01:02:22.058 --> 01:02:24.766
They are just children.

426
01:02:32.391 --> 01:02:33.683
Mommy…

427
01:02:41.433 --> 01:02:42.558
It's okay.

428
01:02:46.933 --> 01:02:50.183
Kill me. I'm the man here. Kill me.

429
01:02:59.225 --> 01:03:03.850
So you did not hide weapons.
You hid something else.


430
01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:06.433
Saleh!

431
01:03:11.475 --> 01:03:12.641
Let them be!

432
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.183
Put them in front of the wall.

433
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:19.641
Stand here. Come on.

434
01:03:24.183 --> 01:03:25.058
Come on!

435
01:03:26.808 --> 01:03:27.641
Move.

436
01:03:29.266 --> 01:03:30.558
Are you hiding your face?

437
01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:36.350
These traits cannot be concealed, traitor!

438
01:03:38.641 --> 01:03:40.808
Move!

439
01:03:55.516 --> 01:03:56.516
Fine.

440
01:04:15.058 --> 01:04:17.350
-Take position.
-Yes, sir.


441
01:04:22.933 --> 01:04:24.391
Aim!

442
01:04:34.183 --> 01:04:35.016
Fire!

443
01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:31.308
-No!
-What are you doing there?


444
01:05:31.933 --> 01:05:34.933
-Come and help me.
-I'm coming.


445
01:05:41.766 --> 01:05:43.266
Quickly.

446
01:05:55.433 --> 01:05:59.558
Get some water
instead of sitting there doing nothing.


447
01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:05.058
He's too heavy. 
We need help, please.

448
01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:00.683
Farha.

449
01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.058
No, we left the baby for you.

450
01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:05.308
A boy. I was right. I won.

451
01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:07.016
Kill him and follow us.

452
01:08:15.183 --> 01:08:17.683
And don't waste a bullet on him.

453
01:08:18.766 --> 01:08:19.891
Don't take too long.

454
01:14:27.391 --> 01:14:30.058
Rock a bye baby

455
01:14:31.475 --> 01:14:33.850
On the tree top

456
01:14:35.975 --> 01:14:38.433
When the wind blows

457
01:14:39.933 --> 01:14:42.225
The cradle will rock

458
01:14:44.683 --> 01:14:47.183
When the bough breaks

459
01:14:48.058 --> 01:14:50.600
The cradle will fall

460
01:14:52.308 --> 01:14:55.141
And down will come baby

461
01:14:56.308 --> 01:14:58.308
Cradle and all

462
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.725
TO MY DEAR FRIEND FARHA
FROM FAREEDA
