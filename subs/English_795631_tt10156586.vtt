00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.035
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:25.473
- [Caller 1] Hey, Kellar.

3
00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:26.308
What's happening?

4
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.475
- [Kellar] Hey partner.

5
00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:28.227
You got the evidence?

6
00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:28.768
- Do I have the evidence?

7
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.187
Are you kidding?

8
00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:33.440
If I did, I would have brought
it in by now, you crazy.


9
00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:34.442
Yeah, word is,

10
00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:38.737
you sell a half a bag
of this seed,


11
00:00:38.778 --> 00:00:40.572
you are an instant millionaire.

12
00:00:40.613 --> 00:00:42.032
(Indistinct)

13
00:00:42.073 --> 00:00:46.870
Yeah, what I heard was there
was some girl (Indistinct)


14
00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:47.870
- [Keller] Really.

15
00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:50.332
- I'd love to get my
hands on it.


16
00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:53.793
All I heard was that it
looks kind of


17
00:00:53.835 --> 00:00:55.670
like what you might
find on a floor


18
00:00:55.712 --> 00:00:58.548
of a small foggy I don't know.

19
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.262
Anyway, I'm not gonna be
coming in for a couple days.


20
00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:04.137
- [Kellar] You got
vacation or is it,


21
00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:06.515
your annual Gonorrhea shut time.

22
00:01:06.557 --> 00:01:07.973
- No it's my dog okay?

23
00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:11.520
I think she's got
scurvy or something.


24
00:01:11.562 --> 00:01:12.562
- [Kellar] Okay.

25
00:01:12.603 --> 00:01:13.897
- Anyway, I'll talk
to you later.


26
00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:14.732
- [Kellar] All right bye.

27
00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:15.608
- See you.

28
00:01:24.658 --> 00:01:26.410
- Money or the stuff.

29
00:01:28.245 --> 00:01:29.370
- I don't have the money.

30
00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:30.372
I don't have the stuff
but I do have...


31
00:01:30.413 --> 00:01:31.205
- What?

32
00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:32.373
- I got an explanation.

33
00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:35.418
- No no no no no explanation.

34
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.630
9ine told me to shoot
you in the head.


35
00:01:38.672 --> 00:01:40.590
- 9ine tells you to do a
lot of things.


36
00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:43.343
If he told you to jump off
a bridge, would you do it?


37
00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:46.805
No you wouldn't
please hear me out,


38
00:01:46.847 --> 00:01:47.972
I've got an explanation.

39
00:01:48.013 --> 00:01:49.933
I think you're gonna like this.

40
00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.935
- No explanations, no anything.

41
00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.895
Money or the stuff right now.

42
00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:55.647
- Hear what I've got to say,

43
00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:58.358
you're gonna understand why
it's gonna be worth the wait.


44
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.483
- Right now.

45
00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:01.653
- I need you to wait one
or two more days.


46
00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:04.490
Everything's gonna be okay,
alright?


47
00:02:04.532 --> 00:02:05.448
- Not alright.

48
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.575
Not alright at all.

49
00:02:06.617 --> 00:02:09.827
- Look, let me tell 9ine myself.

50
00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:12.288
Let me just explain to
him what's going on.


51
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.623
Alright?

52
00:02:13.665 --> 00:02:15.833
- You can explain it to him now.

53
00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.503
- Oh, hey 9ine how's it going?

54
00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:19.922
Good to see you.

55
00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:22.590
Look, We were just
talking about,


56
00:02:22.632 --> 00:02:25.135
what we were talking about.

57
00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:26.345
You understand.

58
00:02:27.387 --> 00:02:28.263
There's an explanation.

59
00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:29.930
- Where is my stuff?

60
00:02:29.972 --> 00:02:31.933
- Okay there is the money
and there is the stuff.


61
00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:33.852
And there is actually
two explanations.


62
00:02:33.893 --> 00:02:35.312
One for the money,

63
00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.063
(man chokes)

64
00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:42.693
- I thought you wanted me
to shoot him in the head?


65
00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:45.155
Go ahead shot him in the head.

66
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.327
Get his fucking badge.

67
00:02:51.828 --> 00:02:54.165

160
00:06:23.873 --> 00:06:24.667
Alright.

161
00:06:24.708 --> 00:06:25.500

162
00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:26.333

167
00:06:29.797 --> 00:06:31.005

168
00:06:31.047 --> 00:06:33.092
(Gun fires)

169
00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:35.885
(car engine revs)

170
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.100
(Indistinct)

171
00:06:42.558 --> 00:06:45.102
- This is what we practiced for,

172
00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:48.565
let's do it let's fucking
get these guys.


173
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.693
- Where the fuck's your gun?

174
00:06:52.735 --> 00:06:53.945
Fuck, lets go.

175
00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:54.738
Now, go.

176
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.785
(gun fires)

177
00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:39.157
(bomb explodes)

178
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.997
(woman screams)

179
00:07:45.038 --> 00:07:47.290
(gun fires)

180
00:07:58.425 --> 00:08:01.180
What the fuck
happened out there?


181
00:08:02.513 --> 00:08:04.600
We made this our mission.

182
00:08:07.602 --> 00:08:11.857
(mumbles) practising
this mission.


183
00:08:13.148 --> 00:08:16.903
Sloppy you need me to
mention anything to you?


184
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.367
Better read the fucking
(indistinct).


185
00:08:22.408 --> 00:08:25.078
All your hat, your
Gucci glasses.


186
00:08:27.038 --> 00:08:29.123
Fuck you better shape up.

187
00:08:32.085 --> 00:08:34.755
That's what you should know huh?

188
00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:37.673
Did you run the idea?

189
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.468
(indistinct)

190
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.513
Is everything here clear?

191
00:08:44.347 --> 00:08:45.473
- Yes sir.

192
00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:49.770
- (Indistinct) what the
fuck is (mumbles)


193
00:08:50.853 --> 00:08:52.605
Your were probably
never worth it.


194
00:08:52.647 --> 00:08:54.440
Where were you
(mumbles) two guys


195
00:08:54.482 --> 00:08:56.275
and you fucking
standing there alone,


196
00:08:56.317 --> 00:09:00.572
and you ain't got no
fucking gun cover our back.


197
00:09:00.613 --> 00:09:02.282
Jesus fucking Christ.

198
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.665
Two months four days
practicing this mission.


199
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.753
I got the best (Indistinct).

200
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.717
Hey get the fuck out of here.

201
00:09:20.758 --> 00:09:21.510
- Sir.

202
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.263
(Dramatic music)

203
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.107
- See you're asking why
we ditch you,


204
00:09:37.148 --> 00:09:40.320
the Philippines and you
pull this shit.


205
00:09:41.362 --> 00:09:43.657
Get the fuck out of my face.

206
00:09:49.453 --> 00:09:50.622
- You made it.

207
00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:03.550
You're finally here.

208
00:10:03.592 --> 00:10:05.137
And I thought the army
was going to turn you


209
00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:07.388
into a stone cold killer.

210
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.807
- Marines dad it was
the marines.


211
00:10:09.848 --> 00:10:12.518
- Army marines shit
it's all the same to me.


212
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.647
I'm just glad you're home.

213
00:10:16.732 --> 00:10:19.485
(birds chirping)

214
00:10:33.957 --> 00:10:35.415
- (mumbles) Kenya upstairs?

215
00:10:35.457 --> 00:10:38.462
- Yeah she's been around all
day but I haven't seen her.


216
00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:40.838
(indistinct)

217
00:10:42.423 --> 00:10:43.633
- And if you left I
should have softened up


218
00:10:43.675 --> 00:10:45.260
a little bit on her.

219
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.930
You know you look just
like your mother.


220
00:10:49.972 --> 00:10:52.057
- Been a while since
I've heard that.


221
00:10:52.098 --> 00:10:54.268
- I guess I can't
believe you're here.


222
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.813
I bet you tried anything
to stay away from us.


223
00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:57.855
- Yeah.

224
00:10:57.897 --> 00:11:00.483
- I just want my family back.

225
00:11:00.525 --> 00:11:01.943
- How did she die?

226
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.158
- A week after you left
that drug dealer


227
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.537
we had a run with came back.

228
00:11:13.412 --> 00:11:15.205
- Don't you pay that butcher.

229
00:11:15.247 --> 00:11:18.585
- Don't tell me what to
do with my money.


230
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.963
- What's happening here?

231
00:11:22.005 --> 00:11:24.215
- Mom's high again.

232
00:11:24.257 --> 00:11:25.800
- Don't disrespect your mother.

233
00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:27.052
- She's a crack head.

234
00:11:27.093 --> 00:11:27.885
- Get out.

235
00:11:27.927 --> 00:11:28.845
- I hate you

236
00:11:35.643 --> 00:11:37.145
- Robin.

237
00:11:37.187 --> 00:11:39.690
- (indistinct)

238
00:11:44.277 --> 00:11:45.695
- They weren't

239
00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:50.367
- We got your mom to
rehab (mumbles) open up,


240
00:11:50.908 --> 00:11:53.287
(indistinct)

241
00:11:55.078 --> 00:11:56.955
- They shop for rehab (mumbles)?

242
00:11:56.997 --> 00:11:59.918
- Sort of what happens
all the time.


243
00:12:03.463 --> 00:12:04.297
- Hey siz

244
00:12:05.673 --> 00:12:06.258
- Hey KK

245
00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:09.260
- Kenya help your
sister with her bag.


246
00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:12.805
Take her bag upstairs
I'm sure she's tired.


247
00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:21.690
- Here let me.

248
00:12:25.693 --> 00:12:28.613
- Thanks (mumbles)

249
00:12:38.538 --> 00:12:43.545
It has actually been a
while since I've been here.


250
00:12:43.587 --> 00:12:46.507
- (mumbles) the same.

251
00:12:47.882 --> 00:12:52.470
You know you don't have
to keep stuff bottled in.


252
00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:54.638
- Keep what bottled in.

253
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.682
- I know you.

254
00:13:01.978 --> 00:13:05.275
- Ever since you left
I've been feeling,


255
00:13:07.902 --> 00:13:10.072
I don't know empty inside.

256
00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:15.660
It's hard keep planting
up some kinda (mumbles).


257
00:13:15.702 --> 00:13:18.205
- I just had to get outta here.

258
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.085
- I felt like you
left me behind.


259
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.297
You taught me a lot about life.

260
00:13:28.672 --> 00:13:31.718
But never anything
about abandonment.


261
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.562
I had to watch mum

262
00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:49.193
(mumbles) like she was a zombie.

263
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.657
I always hoped I really thought

264
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.370
it could get better after rehab.

265
00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:04.375
- I'm sorry if it makes
you feel any better.


266
00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:07.920
The military was not
sunshine and rainbows.


267
00:14:09.172 --> 00:14:12.342
- I can tell you're
hiding things too.


268
00:14:24.143 --> 00:14:28.400
- So this is the type of
stuff you're watching now?


269
00:14:38.952 --> 00:14:40.745
Let me show something.

270
00:14:45.792 --> 00:14:48.378
I want you to punch in my head.

271
00:14:52.757 --> 00:14:53.592
Your turn.

272
00:15:00.682 --> 00:15:01.517
Good job.

273
00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.310
Is that store down the
street still open?


274
00:15:05.352 --> 00:15:07.730
♪ Nowadays I have (mumbles) ♪

276
00:15:10.523 --> 00:15:12.108

277
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.653

278
00:15:14.695 --> 00:15:15.572
- Knoc?

279
00:15:15.613 --> 00:15:17.323
- Hey, how you doing?

280
00:15:17.365 --> 00:15:18.990
What are you doing here?

281
00:15:19.032 --> 00:15:21.160
I thought you was in
army or something.


282
00:15:21.202 --> 00:15:21.993
- Marines.

283
00:15:22.035 --> 00:15:23.287
- Same thing, you know?

284
00:15:23.328 --> 00:15:26.623
Anyway, come here girl
how you doing?


285
00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:29.002
Nice to see you again.

286
00:15:29.043 --> 00:15:30.878
What you doing here?

287
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.297
- My mother got killed.

288
00:15:32.338 --> 00:15:34.047
I'm here for her funeral.

289
00:15:34.088 --> 00:15:35.590
- I'm sorry to hear that
what happened?


290
00:15:35.632 --> 00:15:37.217
- Stray bullet from
a gang fight.


291
00:15:37.258 --> 00:15:41.138
- It's a lot of that going on
here is just gang real talk,


292
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.140
they're called Bloodborne

293
00:15:43.182 --> 00:15:45.642
and they got this
drug called seed.


294
00:15:45.683 --> 00:15:47.103
It's like people are killing
each other, going crazy


295
00:15:47.145 --> 00:15:48.562
in the streets.

296
00:15:48.603 --> 00:15:50.815
You gotta watch out and be
careful while you out here.


297
00:15:50.857 --> 00:15:52.065
Cause it's really bad out here.

298
00:15:52.107 --> 00:15:55.068
So like the police,
ain't doing a damn thing


299
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.112
about none of this you
know what, I mean,


300
00:15:57.153 --> 00:15:58.572
somebody need to do
something about it.


301
00:15:58.613 --> 00:16:00.367
You already know I am.

302
00:16:05.413 --> 00:16:07.832

303
00:16:37.068 --> 00:16:39.907
- Hey sis whoa stand

304
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.118
It's just me.

305
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.910
- My bad sis.

306
00:16:45.952 --> 00:16:49.248

308
00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:53.795
- I'm really glad you're home.

309
00:17:05.515 --> 00:17:07.517
- Fucking gangster shit.

310
00:17:39.132 --> 00:17:41.635

311
00:17:43.845 --> 00:17:45.722

322
00:18:07.658 --> 00:18:10.788
- I'm fine when am I

- That shit never gets old.

332
00:18:40.692 --> 00:18:42.362

some other leadership.

You know what I'm saying?

(mumbles) I don't have
(mumbles) to identify her body.

It's a scan she's at the
city morgue please come.

00:25:04.075 --> 00:25:05.077
- Yes may I help you?

396
00:25:05.118 --> 00:25:06.953
- I'm here to identify a body.

397
00:25:06.995 --> 00:25:08.372
- Body?

398
00:25:08.413 --> 00:25:09.915
Oh, you mean the little girl?

399
00:25:09.957 --> 00:25:10.667
- Yes.

400
00:25:11.583 --> 00:25:14.087
- Yeah upstairs to your right.

401
00:25:33.688 --> 00:25:34.773
- May I help you?

402
00:25:34.815 --> 00:25:37.235
- I'm here to identify a body.

403
00:26:05.053 --> 00:26:07.472
How long has she been here.

404
00:26:07.513 --> 00:26:09.182
- A couple of hours.

405
00:26:09.223 --> 00:26:12.478
Her estimated time of
death was 3:38 pm.


406
00:26:17.273 --> 00:26:20.985
I was so sorry (mumbles)

407
00:26:21.027 --> 00:26:24.072
- Can you tell me what happened?

408
00:26:24.113 --> 00:26:28.995
- Found (mumbles) at
liberty (mumbles)

(soft music)

410
00:26:46.762 --> 00:26:51.098
- [Jerrod] Sarah it's
dad Kenya she's dead.


411
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.185
- She's just
collecting your soul


412
00:26:54.227 --> 00:26:56.563
I look forward to seeing you.

413
00:26:57.522 --> 00:26:59.900
Dad Kenya upstairs?

414
00:26:59.942 --> 00:27:02.235
- You have things too.

415
00:27:02.277 --> 00:27:04.697
You have things too.

416
00:27:04.738 --> 00:27:07.032
You have things too.

417
00:27:07.073 --> 00:27:09.118
- [Sarah] She was just 14.

418
00:27:12.787 --> 00:27:17.167
- [Nurse] Her estimated
time of death was 3:38 pm.


419
00:27:17.208 --> 00:27:18.918
I'm so sorry mum.

420
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.045
- Really glad.

421
00:27:23.882 --> 00:27:27.052
- [Jerrod] I just
want my (mumbles)


422
00:27:27.093 --> 00:27:28.845
- She was just 14,

423
00:27:28.887 --> 00:27:31.263
she was just 14 years old.

424
00:27:31.305 --> 00:27:33.977
- You taught me a
lot about life.


425
00:27:35.852 --> 00:27:38.940
But never anything
about abandonment.


426
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.735
- [Nurse] I'm so sorry mum.

427
00:27:43.777 --> 00:27:48.157
- She was just 14 she
was just 14 years old.


428
00:27:48.198 --> 00:27:50.742
She was just 14 years old.

429
00:27:50.783 --> 00:27:54.245
- [Jerrod] I just
want my (mumbles)


430
00:27:54.287 --> 00:27:56.373
- I felt like you left me.

431
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.252
- [Nurse] I'm so sorry mum.

432
00:28:03.838 --> 00:28:06.008
(mumbles)

433
00:28:10.387 --> 00:28:12.890
(phone rings)

434
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.978
- Is this Sarah Camden?

435
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.605
- Yes it's she.

436
00:28:20.647 --> 00:28:23.192
- I just called to make
sure you knew


437
00:28:23.233 --> 00:28:25.985
what really happened
to your sister.


438
00:28:26.027 --> 00:28:28.405
The detectives wanted
me to keep things quiet.


439
00:28:28.447 --> 00:28:29.655
- Quiet?

440
00:28:29.697 --> 00:28:31.742
- It's a new drug that
hit the streets a couple


441
00:28:31.783 --> 00:28:34.412
of months ago called seed.

442
00:28:34.453 --> 00:28:35.495
- What?

443
00:28:35.537 --> 00:28:37.247
- I've seen drug mules
coming through


444
00:28:37.288 --> 00:28:39.623
with blue all in their system.

445
00:28:39.665 --> 00:28:43.378
And your sister, hers
was the same way.


446
00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.047
- She was a drug mule?

447
00:28:45.088 --> 00:28:48.048
- No, your sister was beaten

448
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.970
and someone forcibly made
her swallow the drugs.


449
00:28:52.012 --> 00:28:54.472
- The cops wanted to
keep it quiet?


450
00:28:54.513 --> 00:28:55.557
- There are some things
you should know


451
00:28:55.598 --> 00:28:58.183
about this city, Ms. Camden.

452
00:28:58.225 --> 00:29:00.228
There are a lot of people
who wanna keep things


453
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.688
in the status quo.

454
00:29:03.148 --> 00:29:04.150
- Thank you.

455
00:29:26.462 --> 00:29:29.298
- Our condolences go
out to Kenya's family.


456
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.885
Who are grieving from the
loss of losing,


457
00:29:31.927 --> 00:29:35.930
not only their mother,
but to lose a daughter


458
00:29:35.972 --> 00:29:38.267
and a sister as well.

459
00:29:38.308 --> 00:29:40.560
When will this violence end?

460
00:29:42.145 --> 00:29:45.983
When will we rise up and
put our faith in God?


461
00:29:49.152 --> 00:29:51.488
Kenya will not be forgotten.

462
00:29:52.865 --> 00:29:54.033
Brother Jacks.

463
00:30:02.582 --> 00:30:06.837
- Church we're here to
mourn yet another lost soul.


464
00:30:11.173 --> 00:30:15.095
Kenya Camden was not only
a friend of my family


465
00:30:17.972 --> 00:30:21.143
the friend of our
congregation family, okay?


466
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.898
Brother Camden and Sidney
and Sarah have been coming


467
00:30:28.525 --> 00:30:31.153
to the church here for
over 25 years.


468
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.908
And yet just last week we
laid to rest mother Camden


469
00:30:38.743 --> 00:30:40.913
and now they placed Kenya.

470
00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.213
Our hearts are heavy.

471
00:30:50.588 --> 00:30:53.217
There's a lot of pain and agony.

472
00:30:57.803 --> 00:30:59.807
Church we feel defeated.

473
00:31:01.598 --> 00:31:06.105
We feel like we can't
accomplish the goal of survival.


474
00:31:09.565 --> 00:31:11.568
How do we overcome that?

475
00:31:14.278 --> 00:31:19.033
What can we do to save the
lives that are remaining here?


476
00:31:24.707 --> 00:31:26.000
Anybody? Anyone?

477
00:31:28.752 --> 00:31:30.922
Wake up we cannot continue

478
00:31:35.508 --> 00:31:37.762
to die and live in despair.

479
00:31:41.055 --> 00:31:45.937
There's a whole community of
people out there that need us.


480
00:31:47.603 --> 00:31:49.355
And this tragedy,

481
00:31:49.397 --> 00:31:52.818
this family, the loss of
another loved one


482
00:31:54.277 --> 00:31:56.280
will not go unforgotten.

483
00:32:00.658 --> 00:32:04.078
- Oh my God, Sarah,
we should mourn


484
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:04.997
- (indistinct)

485
00:32:05.038 --> 00:32:06.457
- Your baby sister

486
00:32:09.208 --> 00:32:11.670
I give you the (mumbles)

487
00:32:11.712 --> 00:32:13.963
- Thank you aunty.

488
00:32:14.005 --> 00:32:16.883
Dad told me to give you
a ride to the airport.


489
00:32:16.925 --> 00:32:18.343
I can't stay here.

490
00:32:18.385 --> 00:32:19.302
Are you ready?

491
00:32:19.343 --> 00:32:21.347
- Yes I'm ready let's go.

492
00:32:25.017 --> 00:32:27.352
So do the police have any leads?

493
00:32:27.393 --> 00:32:28.395
- [Sarah] No they ain't talking.

494
00:32:28.437 --> 00:32:29.770
They don't say a lot.

495
00:32:29.812 --> 00:32:31.815
I'm willing to bet that
Bloodbornes were involved.


496
00:32:31.857 --> 00:32:33.275
- [Sidney] You know
that for sure?


497
00:32:33.317 --> 00:32:34.483
- [Sarah] Gut feeling.

498
00:32:34.525 --> 00:32:35.943
- [Sidney] Are you asking
any questions?


499
00:32:35.985 --> 00:32:37.445
- [Sarah] I don't know
where to start.


500
00:32:37.487 --> 00:32:40.115
- [Sidney] That looks like
a good place to start, stop.


501
00:32:40.157 --> 00:32:41.325
- [Sarah] What?

502
00:32:42.867 --> 00:32:44.493
- I'm going to ask a
couple of questions.


503
00:32:44.535 --> 00:32:47.038
Somebody somewhere, knows
something in this streets.


504
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.832
- You'll miss your flight aunty.

505
00:32:48.873 --> 00:32:50.750
- Relax I'll make it quick.

506
00:32:50.792 --> 00:32:52.793
- That's a dangerous place.

507
00:32:52.835 --> 00:32:53.962
- What could I do?

508
00:32:54.003 --> 00:32:55.338
I'm just the woman.

509
00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.717
(jazz music)

510
00:33:15.733 --> 00:33:19.445
Can you tell me who is the
leader of the Bloodbornes?


511
00:33:19.487 --> 00:33:21.238
- What you want for
little momma?


512
00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.698
- I'm not your momma.

513
00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.410
- Now which one of you is
the leader of the Bloodbornes


514
00:33:26.452 --> 00:33:27.662
- Bitch better get your
ass outta here


515
00:33:27.703 --> 00:33:30.290
before you get your ass whipped.

516
00:33:38.965 --> 00:33:40.467
Crazy momma.

517
00:33:40.508 --> 00:33:42.510
(groans)

518
00:34:03.157 --> 00:34:04.658
- Don't hit women.

(jazz music)

520
00:34:32.477 --> 00:34:35.980
You better tell me where
your leader is,


521
00:34:36.022 --> 00:34:39.108
or we could start this
thing all over again.


522
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.318
- He ain't here

(jazz music)

524
00:34:59.962 --> 00:35:02.215
- Tell him Sidney was here.

525
00:35:15.312 --> 00:35:16.855
- Did you get any information?

526
00:35:16.897 --> 00:35:18.482
- Not really let's go.

527
00:35:18.523 --> 00:35:20.358

homicide detective.


531
00:35:30.283 --> 00:35:32.203
We've just come from the
chief of police,


532
00:35:32.245 --> 00:35:35.415
and he doesn't have any
answers for me.


533
00:35:35.457 --> 00:35:38.502
But what we do have is
homicide folder.


534

And you know what boom

My daughter is missing

What we have here is called

from one of your bosses, to
the other one of your bosses.

His people are dying.

We're not talking just

I'm talking children.

542
00:36:07.197 --> 00:36:08.865
Mr. Knoc son is dead.

543
00:36:14.662 --> 00:36:17.748
- This is the second
son I've lost.


544
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.585
You have yet to do
anything about it.


545
00:36:20.627 --> 00:36:23.880
And like, here's what I
gathered so far.


546
00:36:25.547 --> 00:36:28.133
I just want you to know
if you don't do something


547
00:36:28.175 --> 00:36:31.470
about it, I'mma to have
to figure it out,


548
00:36:31.512 --> 00:36:33.973
and take care of it myself,
because this is not cool.


549
00:36:34.015 --> 00:36:35.892
I got one son left.

550
00:36:35.933 --> 00:36:37.018
It's not good.

551
00:36:38.268 --> 00:36:39.645
- I'll do my best for you sir.

552
00:36:39.687 --> 00:36:42.273
- Your best better
be good enough


553
00:36:42.315 --> 00:36:45.152
because what we need is results.

554

Got that results.

555
00:36:47.445 --> 00:36:48.363

00:36:53.827 --> 00:36:56.913
- Oh, I forgot to tell
you something.


557
00:36:59.123 --> 00:37:02.585
Weed is not illegal
in California.


558
00:37:02.627 --> 00:37:04.337
Anyway I think this
belongs to you.


559
00:37:04.378 --> 00:37:05.380
You should have it.

560
00:37:05.422 --> 00:37:06.880
And that's your partner's.

561
00:37:06.922 --> 00:37:11.512

564
00:37:26.108 --> 00:37:30.363

she's mad, but she's cute.


565
00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:36.412

566
00:37:36.453 --> 00:37:37.203

Sergeant Kellar this is Sarah.

574
00:38:13.197 --> 00:38:15.867
- Listen, Sarah the fact that
you're her big sister cannot.


575
00:38:15.908 --> 00:38:19.580
- No you listen I want
justice for my sister.


576
00:38:22.957 --> 00:38:24.500

my office and he dropped

little girl getting killed.

00:39:42.912 --> 00:39:45.707
- Father's name is
Jerrod Camden.


616
00:39:45.748 --> 00:39:46.873
- Mother's name is Marylyn

617
00:39:46.915 --> 00:39:48.918
but looks like she
died last week.


618
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.128
She caught a bullet in
a gang fight.

- Oh my God.

620
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.550

but so she got killed


621
00:39:55.592 --> 00:39:56.758
the other day.

622
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.260

her file's sitting on my desk.

624
00:40:01.138 --> 00:40:03.725
All of her military
records are blacked out.


625
00:40:03.767 --> 00:40:04.685
- Oh my God.

626
00:40:06.352 --> 00:40:09.688
- Except she's a weapon's expert

627
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.815
that must be some top
secret shit.


628
00:40:11.857 --> 00:40:16.070
Except this she was diagnosed
with PTSD about a year ago.

- That all may makes sense now.

- Alright.

671
00:41:41.322 --> 00:41:42.865
- Got any warrants?

672
00:41:42.907 --> 00:41:45.283
- Maybe yeah I'll talk
to you later.


673
00:41:45.325 --> 00:41:46.743
Let you do what you do.

You gon to take care of her.

- I'll be seeing you around.

676
00:41:49.705 --> 00:41:52.208
- Okay do I look scared of you.

677
00:41:56.587 --> 00:41:59.090
I'll be in the car if
you need me.


678
00:41:59.132 --> 00:42:00.883
- I'm surprised to see you here.

679
00:42:00.925 --> 00:42:02.343
- Well you shouldn't be.

680
00:42:02.385 --> 00:42:03.635
I followed you.

681
00:42:03.677 --> 00:42:06.138
I knew you were gonna do
something stupid.


682
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.973
- Self-defense

683
00:42:08.015 --> 00:42:10.685
- Self-defense
really lieutenant.


684
00:42:12.812 --> 00:42:14.313
Yeah, that's right.

685
00:42:14.355 --> 00:42:16.482
I did a background check on you.

686
00:42:16.523 --> 00:42:19.485
Seems like you're some
kind of spook for the army?


687
00:42:19.527 --> 00:42:20.903
- Marines.

688
00:42:20.945 --> 00:42:23.697
- Bullshit tell me the truth.

689
00:42:23.738 --> 00:42:26.783
- I did counter
insurgency for the CIA.


690
00:42:26.825 --> 00:42:30.247
My CO even gave me a code
name snow black.


691
00:42:40.798 --> 00:42:43.092
I was a high rank killer.

692
00:42:43.133 --> 00:42:45.177
No better than the dirt
bags I was putting


693
00:42:45.218 --> 00:42:48.140
in (mumbles) boxes.

694
00:42:55.353 --> 00:43:00.275
Before that I was brought up
on a review for depression.


695
00:43:00.317 --> 00:43:02.027
I thought I was losing my mind.

696
00:43:02.068 --> 00:43:04.030
I even put a bullet to my head.

697
00:43:04.072 --> 00:43:06.073
What the fuck was I thinking?

698
00:43:06.115 --> 00:43:08.492
- Then why are you back here?

699
00:43:08.533 --> 00:43:09.618
- My mother died.

700
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.662
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye.


701
00:43:11.703 --> 00:43:13.415
I came to bury my mum.

702
00:43:14.915 --> 00:43:17.835
Someone so beautiful
yet so deadly.


703
00:43:18.793 --> 00:43:21.213
- I do what needs to be done.

704
00:43:23.798 --> 00:43:27.052
- Don't you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.


705
00:43:27.093 --> 00:43:29.763
- They don't know what they're
getting themselves into.


706
00:43:29.805 --> 00:43:31.015
- So is that what you gonna do?

707
00:43:31.057 --> 00:43:32.225
Be a vigilante?

708
00:43:33.392 --> 00:43:34.727
- Who else will?

709
00:43:35.895 --> 00:43:38.022
- Excuse me you're gonna
have to leave.


710
00:43:38.063 --> 00:43:39.398
I need to check her vitals.

711
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.858
She needs to rest.

712
00:43:55.747 --> 00:43:58.250
- [Kellar] Hey Sarah it's
Kellar I saw you were discharged


713
00:43:58.292 --> 00:44:00.795

714
00:44:00.837 --> 00:44:02.170

715
00:44:02.212 --> 00:44:05.925
Also I have a contact that
maybe able to help you,


716
00:44:05.967 --> 00:44:07.468
his name is Wesson.

717
00:44:08.678 --> 00:44:11.430
(dramatic music)

718
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.948
- What's a little girl
like you want with all this


719
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:30.575
heavy artillery.

720
00:44:30.617 --> 00:44:32.285
- City's full of rats

721
00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.203
- Space too big (mumbles)

722
00:44:35.245 --> 00:44:36.330
- Fucking huge

723
00:44:38.123 --> 00:44:39.792
- You're starting a war.

724
00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:42.712
- The war's already started.

725
00:44:42.753 --> 00:44:45.423
(dramatic music)

726
00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:09.738
(door knocks)

727
00:45:10.948 --> 00:45:11.783
- Oh shit

728
00:45:15.662 --> 00:45:16.495
- Fuck

729
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.333
(dramatic music)

730
00:45:35.472 --> 00:45:38.725
- Welcome to the
Jessica Kendall show.


731
00:45:38.767 --> 00:45:42.520
The show that never lies
about the truth.


732
00:45:42.562 --> 00:45:46.610
We have the honorable mayor
Pilgrim with us today.


733
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.945
Welcome to the show.

734
00:45:49.987 --> 00:45:50.780
- Thank you.

735
00:45:50.822 --> 00:45:52.198
And you can call me Win

736
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.450
- Thank you so much Win.

737
00:45:54.492 --> 00:45:57.327
- Of course it's
great to be here.


738
00:45:57.368 --> 00:45:59.788
You know, as mayor of
King city, any opportunity


739
00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:01.038
I get to brag

740
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.917
about my city and the
great things we're doing


741
00:46:03.958 --> 00:46:06.127
I'm more than happy to do so.

742
00:46:06.168 --> 00:46:10.923
- So tell us a little bit
about what you do for our city.


743
00:46:10.965 --> 00:46:15.178
We hear so much but I wanna
hear the truth from you.


744
00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:19.642
- Well, I mean, we've got a
lot of civic projects going on.


745
00:46:19.683 --> 00:46:21.310
A lot of inclusiveness.

746
00:46:21.352 --> 00:46:25.605
We're always looking to
honor all of our people


747
00:46:25.647 --> 00:46:27.733
all the diversity that
we have that we're proud


748
00:46:27.775 --> 00:46:30.153
of in King city, infrastructure,

749
00:46:31.653 --> 00:46:34.990
King city's on the rise, we're
happy to be a part of it.


750
00:46:35.032 --> 00:46:36.283
- So I hear that

751
00:46:37.783 --> 00:46:41.622
you know, about gang
Bloodbornes, the Bloodbornes?


752
00:46:42.957 --> 00:46:46.585
- Right we are aware of
the, the bloodbornes,


753
00:46:46.627 --> 00:46:47.878
we're aware of this new drug

754
00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.838
the seed that they're pushing.

755
00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:54.635
And we're constantly trying
to take it out of distribution


756
00:46:56.093 --> 00:47:00.890
and hold people accountable
that they're pushing it.


757
00:47:00.932 --> 00:47:04.645
- You're out there in the
city, you must be talking


758
00:47:04.687 --> 00:47:08.107
to them, you know have
some kind of relationship.


759
00:47:08.148 --> 00:47:11.777
- So we have no ties or
affiliations with the


760
00:47:11.818 --> 00:47:12.862
Bloodbornes.

761
00:47:14.613 --> 00:47:16.198
I am aware of them.

762
00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.868
I have had concerned
citizens come to us,


763
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:24.123
about even the deaths that
have occurred because of that.


764
00:47:24.165 --> 00:47:25.582
- [Jessica] Yeah.

765
00:47:25.623 --> 00:47:30.630
- I've worked with people
that are concerned, citizens,


766
00:47:30.672 --> 00:47:31.255
some with like

767
00:47:32.672 --> 00:47:36.803
well, I mean, for instance,
Ricardo White, who has


768
00:47:39.888 --> 00:47:44.102
funds available to help
us try and eliminate this.


769
00:47:44.143 --> 00:47:45.935
And he's a concerned person

770
00:47:45.977 --> 00:47:49.690
citizen who is aiding us
in finding the resources


771
00:47:49.732 --> 00:47:50.982
to do something (mumbles)

772
00:47:51.023 --> 00:47:54.612
What is your affiliation
with Ricardo White?


773
00:47:56.488 --> 00:48:00.910
= Well, the truth is that
people will push a narrative.


774
00:48:00.952 --> 00:48:02.162
And the truth is,

775
00:48:02.203 --> 00:48:02.953
- Yeah

776
00:48:02.995 --> 00:48:04.412
- If you let a rumor run,

777
00:48:04.453 --> 00:48:09.210
it will run rampant that
you're not gonna get the truth.


778
00:48:09.252 --> 00:48:10.377
When you're gonna

779
00:48:10.418 --> 00:48:12.295
- I think it's a little
more than that.


780
00:48:12.337 --> 00:48:14.882
- So they're just rumors
and if you're trying to...


781
00:48:14.923 --> 00:48:16.967
- [Host] Come on (mumbles)
calm down you don't have...


782
00:48:17.008 --> 00:48:20.720
- No I think maybe you
need to calm down.


783
00:48:20.762 --> 00:48:23.307
My daughter's been
kidnapped by probably


784
00:48:23.348 --> 00:48:26.143
this exact same people who have

785
00:48:26.185 --> 00:48:27.770
my beautiful daughter Jennifer.

786
00:48:27.812 --> 00:48:30.147
And I am a victim of
this myself.


787
00:48:30.188 --> 00:48:31.482
- Oh we have a call.

788
00:48:31.523 --> 00:48:33.275
- [Sarah] A 14 year old
little girl was killed.


789
00:48:33.317 --> 00:48:36.195
She was my sister, what
are you gonna do about it?


790
00:48:36.237 --> 00:48:38.447
- Caller what is your name?

791
00:48:38.488 --> 00:48:40.490
- [Sarah] My name is Sarah.

792
00:48:40.532 --> 00:48:42.702
- Sarah, do you know Sarah?

793
00:48:44.327 --> 00:48:47.498
- I don't Sarah, I'm
sorry for your loss.


794
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.502
Like I just shared my
family also is dealing


795
00:48:52.543 --> 00:48:57.092
with a kidnapping involved
with this and the death of any


796
00:48:58.008 --> 00:49:00.512
of my people I take personally

797
00:49:02.137 --> 00:49:04.180
what am I going to do about it?

798
00:49:04.222 --> 00:49:05.973
