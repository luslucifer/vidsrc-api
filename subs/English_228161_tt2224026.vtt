<i>Who are the Boov?</i>

7
00:00:57.478 --> 00:01:01.649
<i>Answer: Best species ever at running away.</i>

8
00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:05.111
<i>All Boov settlers, please report
to your assigned transport.</i>


9
00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:06.571
<i>You are allowed one carry-on.</i>

10
00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:08.573
Excusing me. Sorries.

11
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.992
Excusing me.
Pardon the me, friend.


12
00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.660
Boov do not friend.

13
00:01:13.244 --> 00:01:13.786
Owpain!!

14
00:01:13.953 --> 00:01:14.954
Uh-oh. Sorries.

15

<i>Who am I? I am Oh.</i>

16

<i>I has been given this name

17
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.630
- Good morning!

18
00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:24.923
- Hi, guys.
- Oh.


19
00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:26.089
- Hello.

Captain Smek!

24
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.040
My fellow Boov!

25
00:01:59.207 --> 00:02:00.959
I has saved us again.

26
00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:03.543
A bit lower.

27
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.712
No, stop!

28
00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:05.880
Up a bit. Up a bit.

29
00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:08.299
Perfect. Walk away. Walk away.

30
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.717
My fellow...

31
00:02:10.718 --> 00:02:11.719
My...

32
00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:13.554
fellow...

33
00:02:15.348 --> 00:02:16.349
Boov.

34
00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:19.978
Good news!

35
00:02:20.728 --> 00:02:22.730
Thanks to my leadership skills...

36
00:02:22.897 --> 00:02:25.733
cowering, running
and pulling a skedaddle...


37
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.070
we are safe from our enemy...
the Gorg.


38
00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:33.992
Nasty.

39
00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:40.331
Give Daddy some sugar!

40
00:02:40.748 --> 00:02:43.001
Captain Smek has saved us again!

41
00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:47.922
We are now arrived at the best
hiding place yet in the Milky Way.


42
00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.591
And the Gorg are lactose intolerant.

43
00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:52.427
Genius!

44
00:02:52.593 --> 00:02:54.929
They will never find us here.

45
00:02:55.263 --> 00:02:56.431
Thank you!

46
00:02:57.765 --> 00:02:58.933
Best of yet...

47
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.436
this planet is full of great stuff.

48
00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:05.273
Look at these delicious fruits!

49
00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:10.695
That makes me feel so good.

50
00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:13.531
What fun at a party!

51
00:03:13.698 --> 00:03:15.116
Boov do not party.

52
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.535
Also, this planet is inhabited.

53
00:03:17.702 --> 00:03:18.870
But do not worry.

54
00:03:19.037 --> 00:03:22.457
The native savages are
simple and backwards.


55
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.254
They are so ugly, they are cute!

56
00:03:29.797 --> 00:03:32.216
Everything you need to know about them
can be found...


57
00:03:32.383 --> 00:03:34.385
in these comprehensive pamphlets.

58
00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:36.971
Comprehensive pamphlet.
Comprehensive pamphlet.


59
00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:39.474
They are lucky the Boov have come.

60
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.310
All right, Boov. 
Invade on three.

61
00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:43.561
One, two, three.

62
00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.822
<i>Rejoice, humanspeople!
The Boov are arrived!</i>


63
00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.617
<i>Now we are turning off
your gravity temporarily...</i>


64
00:03:57.784 --> 00:04:01.245
<i>so as to make your mandatory
relocation easier.</i>


65
00:04:01.412 --> 00:04:02.914
<i>And more fun!</i>

66
00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:04.791
<i>So, what is up?</i>

67
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:06.375
<i>You are!</i>

68
00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:22.725
You'll never catch me!

69
00:04:25.103 --> 00:04:28.064
<i>Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...</i>


70
00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:31.234
<i>as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.</i>


71
00:04:48.084 --> 00:04:50.419
This is so cool! Come on!

72
00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:55.091
<i>Fa-da!</i>

73
00:04:55.258 --> 00:05:00.179
<i>Humanspersons are happiness and joy forever
in Happy Humanstown.</i>


74
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:02.140
Welcome to your new home.

75
00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:04.225
- Wait, what? No!
- New home?


76
00:05:04.392 --> 00:05:06.978
<i>And rest of planet is for Boov.</i>

77
00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:08.312
<i>Win-win!</i>

78
00:05:13.234 --> 00:05:14.735
<i>Welcome, Boov settlers.</i>

79
00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:16.988
<i>All humans have been relocated.</i>

80
00:05:17.155 --> 00:05:18.781
<i>Your homes are now ready.</i>

81
00:05:18.948 --> 00:05:20.283
Thanking you!

82
00:05:23.828 --> 00:05:26.873
<i>This planet may be
a bit of a fixing-it-upper...</i>


83
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.291
<i>but that is okay.</i>

84
00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:32.003
<i>Boov are best at deciding what is useful.</i>

85
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.421
<i>And what is not.</i>

86
00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:35.839
Owpain.

87
00:05:36.174 --> 00:05:38.176
Step aside. Clean-up crew.

88
00:05:38.342 --> 00:05:39.468
<i>Useless.</i>

89
00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:50.771
<i>Today, I starts a new life.</i>

90
00:05:50.938 --> 00:05:54.150
<i>With new friends. 
In a new home.</i>

91
00:05:55.526 --> 00:05:58.613
<i>Residents may now enter sector 179.</i>

92
00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:59.780
That is me!

93
00:05:59.947 --> 00:06:04.327
<i>And that is why
today is best day ever!</i>

94
00:06:24.347 --> 00:06:26.515
Welcome home, neighbors!

95
00:06:26.682 --> 00:06:28.643
Boov do not have "neighbors."

96
00:06:29.018 --> 00:06:32.897
That is owing to the size
and topography of our former planet.


97
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:37.318
Hey! Can I borrowing a cup of sugar?

98
00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:40.696
What?

99
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.117
But now, our closer proximity
can leads to friendship.


100
00:06:45.576 --> 00:06:47.119
You are all invited...

101
00:06:47.286 --> 00:06:49.413
to my warming of house party.

102
00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:52.667
Say, 5200?

103
00:06:53.084 --> 00:06:54.085
Sure.

104
00:06:54.835 --> 00:06:55.835
Yes!

105
00:08:00.234 --> 00:08:03.195
<i>Hey, Pig! Be careful up there!</i>

106
00:08:04.322 --> 00:08:05.322
I'm sorry, Pig.

107
00:08:05.656 --> 00:08:06.949
Mom's not here.

108
00:08:07.116 --> 00:08:08.242
It's just a video.

109
00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:11.120
<i>Hey, Mom.
I think Pig wants to join us.</i>


110
00:08:11.996 --> 00:08:13.247
<i>It's not funny!</i>

111
00:08:13.956 --> 00:08:14.956
<i>Tip!</i>

112
00:08:15.082 --> 00:08:16.959
<i>Come on, Mom. 
It's just snow.</i>

113
00:08:17.126 --> 00:08:18.586
<i>I don't know anything about snow.</i>

114
00:08:18.753 --> 00:08:21.255
<i>We're from Barbados!
We don't have snow!</i>


115
00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:25.133
<i>Are you okay?</i>

116
00:08:26.052 --> 00:08:27.928
<i>I'm sending this to everyone.</i>

117
00:08:43.277 --> 00:08:46.530
<i>Sector 195 is ready for occupation.</i>

118
00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:50.451
We can't wait for Mom, Pig.
We gotta go.


119
00:08:51.118 --> 00:08:52.118
Right now!

120
00:09:21.982 --> 00:09:22.982
Oh, no!

121
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.410
<i>Prepare for your dance attack!</i>

122
00:09:53.055 --> 00:09:55.182
Okay, let's go find Mom.

123
00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:30.217
Neighbors, hello!

124
00:10:32.386 --> 00:10:34.138
Please come in and...

125
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.019
Hello.

126
00:10:43.564 --> 00:10:44.564
Hello?

127
00:11:21.018 --> 00:11:23.145
And right. And left. Other left.

128
00:11:23.312 --> 00:11:24.396
Kyle!

129
00:11:26.148 --> 00:11:27.148
Right. No, left.

130
00:11:27.274 --> 00:11:28.984
Hello, friend Kyle.

131
00:11:30.027 --> 00:11:31.445
I am not your friend.

132
00:11:31.612 --> 00:11:34.657
Of course you are.
We have had many enjoyable talks.


133
00:11:35.324 --> 00:11:37.993
No, we talk only because
I'm not allowed to move.


134
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.496
You are always saying the funny things.

135
00:11:40.663 --> 00:11:44.458
Perhaps you can say them
at my warming of house party tonight.


136
00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:48.879
I will not. Parties are useless
and take up valuable Boov time.


137
00:11:49.046 --> 00:11:51.799
Since you are at your busyness,
I shall send an e-vite to you...


138
00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:54.176
so you can join later
during your leisure minute.


139
00:11:54.343 --> 00:11:56.470
Please do not send.
I enjoy my leisure minute.


140
00:11:56.637 --> 00:11:59.640
Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.


141
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:03.352
<i>Fa-da! I have sent directions
to my living space.</i>


142
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.898
You sent directions to everyone?

143
00:12:08.315 --> 00:12:10.359
What? It is not my fault.

144
00:12:10.985 --> 00:12:14.446
Whyfor put "send" button
right next to "send all"?


145
00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:16.115
This is just bad design.

146
00:12:16.282 --> 00:12:20.327
Your invite has been sent
to entire galaxy!


147
00:12:20.828 --> 00:12:21.828
Uh-oh.

148
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.581
"Uh-oh" is right!

149
00:12:23.747 --> 00:12:26.208
Our enemy, the Gorg, will receive it...

150
00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:28.961
and can use directions for to find us!

151
00:12:29.128 --> 00:12:30.421
The Gorg?

152
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.388
<i>Fa-da!</i>

153
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:43.976
You have doomed our species!

154
00:12:45.144 --> 00:12:45.936
No, please.

155
00:12:46.103 --> 00:12:48.272
I did not mean to. I am sorries!

156
00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:49.982
You are arresting!

157
00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:51.317
No!

158
00:12:51.483 --> 00:12:53.152
I was just trying
to invite you to my...

159
00:12:56.947 --> 00:12:58.157
Security has been compromised.

160
00:12:58.324 --> 00:13:00.034
Arrest that Boov!

161
00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:03.537
Autopilot, I needs help!

162
00:13:03.704 --> 00:13:07.041
<i>Help is available in Paris
at Boov Headquarters.</i>


163
00:13:07.207 --> 00:13:09.543
No, Autopilot!
Any place but Paris!


164
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.046
You must takes me to a place
with no Boovs.


165
00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:16.050
<i>The only remaining spot on planet
with no Boov is Antarctica.</i>


166
00:13:17.843 --> 00:13:19.136
Group hug!

167
00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:24.058
Yes! Antarctica is perfect!
Take me there now!


168
00:13:25.643 --> 00:13:28.020
<i>I am sorry. 
You are fugitive Boov.</i>

169
00:13:28.187 --> 00:13:29.688
<i>Initiating Self
-Destruct.</i>

170
00:13:29.855 --> 00:13:31.523
No! Do not initiate!

171
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.983
I am not a fugitive!

172
00:13:48.415 --> 00:13:49.415
No!

173
00:14:11.772 --> 00:14:12.856
Oh, no.

174
00:15:29.266 --> 00:15:31.685
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!

175
00:15:33.854 --> 00:15:35.439
Whatfor are you did this?

176
00:15:35.606 --> 00:15:38.692
I am Boov, beloved by all humans.

177
00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:40.360
I know what you are.

178
00:15:40.527 --> 00:15:43.030
Excellent! Can I come into the out now?

179
00:15:43.197 --> 00:15:45.616
No, you cannot "come into the out" now.

180
00:15:45.783 --> 00:15:48.160
You can never come into the out,
ever again!


181
00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:50.329
But I can!

182
00:15:50.496 --> 00:15:53.373
You are just having
to take away the piece of wood.


183
00:15:54.625 --> 00:15:57.044
Then I will have to...

184
00:15:57.211 --> 00:16:01.381
I will shoot forth the lasers
from my eyeballs!


185
00:16:02.466 --> 00:16:03.801
You can do that?

186
00:16:05.135 --> 00:16:06.678
Yes.

187
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.894
If you shoot your eye lasers,
then I'll have no choice...


188
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:15.562
but to explode your head!

189
00:16:15.729 --> 00:16:18.482
- You humans cannot to explode...
- We can too!


190
00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:19.983
We just don't much.

191
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.360
It's considered rude.

192
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.489
Then I am granting you a truce.

193
00:16:25.656 --> 00:16:27.658
You are not to exploding heads...

194
00:16:27.825 --> 00:16:30.744
and I will not do my
devastating eye lasers.


195
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:35.874
Okay. Truce.

196
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:37.751
- So, can I come into the out now?
- No!


197
00:16:38.168 --> 00:16:41.839
This is what you get
for stealing planets and abducting people.


198
00:16:42.005 --> 00:16:43.590
You are thinking a mistake.

199
00:16:43.757 --> 00:16:46.051
Boov do not steal and abduct.

200
00:16:46.218 --> 00:16:49.054
No, Boov liberate and befriend.

201
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:52.599
Guess who made this one!

202
00:16:53.767 --> 00:16:55.519
This is so beautiful!

203
00:16:57.354 --> 00:16:59.356
Mom! What's happening?

204
00:16:59.523 --> 00:17:00.607
I don't know, honey.

205
00:17:03.277 --> 00:17:04.277
Tip!

206
00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:06.613
It will be okay.

207
00:17:09.783 --> 00:17:12.911
<i>Lifeform detected. Not human.
Move along.</i>


208
00:17:13.078 --> 00:17:15.789
<i>Enjoy you the frozen, sweetened
bovine secretion...</i>


209
00:17:15.956 --> 00:17:18.292
<i>as we take this short flight
to Happy Humanstown.</i>


210
00:17:19.042 --> 00:17:20.127
Mom!

211
00:17:23.422 --> 00:17:25.591
It's all your fault.

212
00:17:25.757 --> 00:17:27.926
You stole my mom!

213
00:17:28.635 --> 00:17:30.804
Smell ya later, Boov.

214
00:17:30.971 --> 00:17:32.598
Wait! Smell me now!

215
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:36.143
I can to fixing your car.
I seen you has broken it.


216
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.979
I didn't break it.
I'm a very good driver.


217
00:17:39.146 --> 00:17:41.607
It's supposed to leak like that.

218
00:17:55.746 --> 00:17:57.956
Can I come into the out now?

219
00:17:59.583 --> 00:18:04.004
<i>I know the fugitive Boov has made
yet another in a series of horrible...</i>


220
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:07.341
<i>yet unintentionally humorous mistakes.</i>

221
00:18:07.507 --> 00:18:10.761
<i>But let me reassure you,
the signal he broadcast...</i>


222
00:18:10.928 --> 00:18:12.137
<i>is being handled.</i>

223
00:18:12.304 --> 00:18:15.682
We are definitely not doomed.

224
00:18:16.433 --> 00:18:18.977
- And we're out.
- We are doomed!


225
00:18:19.061 --> 00:18:21.313
The Gorg are going to find us again!

226
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.690
The maniac Boov has ruined everything.

227
00:18:23.857 --> 00:18:25.943
This is bad.

228
00:18:29.529 --> 00:18:31.323
And I really love this planet.

229
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.742
Look at all the great stuff they've got.

230
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.162
Like this! A headband!

231
00:18:37.329 --> 00:18:40.374
And for evening wear, you slide it down...

232
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.250
you got a beautiful spare tire.

233
00:18:42.417 --> 00:18:43.417
I love it!

234
00:18:43.543 --> 00:18:44.711
Very nice!

235
00:18:44.878 --> 00:18:47.506
Who would wanna leave this behind?
I have got to fix this.


236
00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:49.007
I know!

237
00:18:49.174 --> 00:18:51.176
Summon the Big Brain Boovs.

238
00:18:51.343 --> 00:18:53.512
The smarty-pants
of all smarty panty Booviness.


239
00:18:54.596 --> 00:18:57.557
Gentleboov... I want ideas.

240
00:18:59.977 --> 00:19:02.604
We could create an alternate reality
with no Gorg in it...


241
00:19:02.771 --> 00:19:04.523
then go live there.

242
00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.900
Yes! I love it!

243
00:19:07.067 --> 00:19:08.318
How long would that take?

244
00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:10.487
Based on our current technology...

245
00:19:12.406 --> 00:19:14.032
1.7 million years.

246
00:19:14.199 --> 00:19:16.952
That's a lot of years, Toni.
Moving on!


247
00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:19.162
- We could lay on the ground...
- Yes!


248
00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:22.499
And make the Gorg think we are dead.

249
00:19:25.544 --> 00:19:26.753
Next!

250
00:19:27.504 --> 00:19:29.840
What if we logged into
the fugitive Boov's email...


251
00:19:30.007 --> 00:19:31.299
and cancelled his e-vite...

252
00:19:31.466 --> 00:19:34.928
Shush! Or we could log into
the fugitive Boov's email...


253
00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:37.806
and cancel his invitation, and...

254
00:19:38.265 --> 00:19:39.057
What was that?

255
00:19:39.224 --> 00:19:40.767
So the Gorg never receive it.

256
00:19:40.892 --> 00:19:43.270
So the Gorg never receive it!

257
00:19:43.437 --> 00:19:47.399
Now, type in the password
and cancel that message.


258
00:19:47.566 --> 00:19:51.028
It was a good idea of me
to make all passwords "password."


259
00:19:51.194 --> 00:19:52.279
It's so easy to remember.

260
00:19:53.697 --> 00:19:57.534
It did not work! 
His password is unique.

261
00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:58.952
No!

262
00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:02.497
Unique? Boov are not unique!

263
00:20:03.915 --> 00:20:05.167
Fetch me my inhaler.

264
00:20:11.423 --> 00:20:13.050
Boy, that works.

265
00:20:13.216 --> 00:20:15.469
His mistaking is leading the Gorg
right to us.


266
00:20:15.635 --> 00:20:16.803
Show me his invite.

267
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.432
<i>You are all invited to a party!</i>

268
00:20:20.599 --> 00:20:21.767
<i>Just head to the Milky Way.</i>

269
00:20:21.933 --> 00:20:23.185
<i>Turn right at the Big Dipper.</i>

270
00:20:23.351 --> 00:20:24.644
<i>Third planet from the Sun.</i>

271
00:20:24.811 --> 00:20:27.147
<i>Look for my balloons! Party!</i>

272
00:20:27.898 --> 00:20:29.941
<i>Come if you like to have fun!</i>

273
00:20:30.108 --> 00:20:31.943
<i>My best friend Kyle will be there!</i>

274
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.820
<i>Kyle, Kyle, Kyle!</i>

275
00:20:34.237 --> 00:20:35.237
<i>(Come Daft)”</i>

276
00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:37.532
Kyle!

277
00:20:37.949 --> 00:20:39.743
He is not my friend.

278
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.037
The internet does not lie!

279
00:20:42.204 --> 00:20:43.914
You know him, you can find him.

280
00:20:44.081 --> 00:20:45.582
I am putting you in charge!

281
00:20:45.749 --> 00:20:48.389
But, Captain, it is not my job.
I am only a mid-level traffic Boov.


282
00:20:48.752 --> 00:20:50.712
- I admire your cowardice, Officer.
- Thank you.


283
00:20:50.879 --> 00:20:55.175
But I want every Boovcop on Planet Smekland
searching this city.


284
00:20:55.383 --> 00:20:56.927
We need his password...

285
00:20:57.094 --> 00:21:00.305
or we will all
be destroyed by the Gorg!

286
00:21:00.472 --> 00:21:01.472
Find him!

287
00:21:01.515 --> 00:21:05.644
That Boov has made his final mistake.

288
00:21:05.977 --> 00:21:06.978
Fa-da!

289
00:21:07.145 --> 00:21:08.897
You were supposed to fix it!

290
00:21:09.064 --> 00:21:10.190
What is this?

291
00:21:10.357 --> 00:21:12.442
I calls it "Slushious."

292
00:21:33.088 --> 00:21:34.088
"Slushious"?

293
00:21:34.131 --> 00:21:35.465
It makes excellent fuel...

294
00:21:35.632 --> 00:21:37.259
and comes in fun-to-say flavors.

295
00:21:37.676 --> 00:21:38.676
"Grape Escape."

296
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.928
"Tangerine Twist."

297
00:21:40.095 --> 00:21:41.346
"Busta Lime"!

298
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.682
Mom's gonna kill me.

299
00:21:43.849 --> 00:21:48.812
Now I am prepared to accept one of your
traditional gestures of human gratitude.


300
00:21:48.979 --> 00:21:52.315
Actually, our tradition is to punch you
in the nose. Hold still.


301
00:21:52.482 --> 00:21:54.693
No! Your gratitude is implied.

302
00:21:57.237 --> 00:21:58.446
You can drives first.

303
00:21:58.613 --> 00:22:01.324
Then I can... You're not coming.

304
00:22:01.491 --> 00:22:03.994
I'm trying to hide from the Boov.
I'm not bringing one with me.


305
00:22:04.161 --> 00:22:05.370
You'll just turn me in.

306
00:22:05.537 --> 00:22:07.581
No! I just needs a ride!

307
00:22:07.747 --> 00:22:10.917
I haves official Boov business
out of in town.


308
00:22:11.084 --> 00:22:12.084
Me, too.

309
00:22:12.794 --> 00:22:14.254
But I fixes your car!

310
00:22:14.421 --> 00:22:16.631
So? I let you out of the freezer.
We're even.


311
00:22:30.312 --> 00:22:32.772
- What did you do to my car?
- What doos you mean?


312
00:22:32.939 --> 00:22:34.399
It should to hover much better now.

313
00:22:34.566 --> 00:22:37.402
It's a car. It
didn't hover at all before.

314
00:22:38.445 --> 00:22:40.113
How do you stop this thing?

315
00:22:51.958 --> 00:22:56.463
Oops. I have apparently reversing
the proceed and anti-proceed controls.


316
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.007
Yeah, I noticed. Stop is go.

317
00:22:59.716 --> 00:23:00.967
- Go is stop.
- Wait!


318
00:23:01.134 --> 00:23:04.304
Whyfor you do this?
Boovs and humans are friends!


319
00:23:04.471 --> 00:23:06.890
We're not friends.
You kidnapped my mom!


320
00:23:11.061 --> 00:23:12.145
Who is Mimom?

321
00:23:12.312 --> 00:23:13.396
No, "my" mom!

322
00:23:13.563 --> 00:23:14.898
What did I say?

323
00:23:19.736 --> 00:23:21.488
- I knows how to find her.
- How?


324
00:23:21.655 --> 00:23:24.199
That information is at
Boov Central Command.


325
00:23:24.366 --> 00:23:26.034
- At the Great Antenna.
- What?


326
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:28.453
In Paris! Now let me to inside!

327
00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.746
Paris.

328
00:23:31.414 --> 00:23:32.916
- Then promise.
- What?


329
00:23:33.083 --> 00:23:35.669
Promise you'll help me find her
or I'm leaving your Boov butt.


330
00:23:37.671 --> 00:23:41.424
I promise! But if you do not wish
to be capturing, it must be now!


331
00:23:45.845 --> 00:23:47.180
Fine. Get in.

332
00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:09.077
Oui, oui, Pig!
Paris, here we come.


333
00:24:09.786 --> 00:24:11.913
We're gonna find out
where they put Mom.


334
00:24:29.723 --> 00:24:34.561
Okay. I shall set the GPS
to take us straight to the Paris.


335
00:24:36.855 --> 00:24:39.399
<i>Destination entered: Antarctica.</i>

336
00:24:39.899 --> 00:24:41.151
Hey, what are you doing?

337
00:24:41.609 --> 00:24:43.278
How did that happen?

338
00:24:43.445 --> 00:24:46.114
Keep your Boov paws off my car!

339
00:24:47.741 --> 00:24:48.783
Whoa!

340
00:24:50.869 --> 00:24:52.537
Your vehicle is infested.

341
00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.623
It's not infested. He's my pet.

342
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.126
His name is Pig. 
Don't touch him.

343
00:24:58.293 --> 00:24:59.794
Now he is vibrating.

344
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:01.546
Is he going to explode?

345
00:25:01.713 --> 00:25:03.715
No! He's just purring.

346
00:25:03.882 --> 00:25:05.175
Why do you haves this thing?

347
00:25:05.342 --> 00:25:08.470
Is it useful? Does
it give meat or milk?

348
00:25:08.636 --> 00:25:10.305
What? No!

349
00:25:10.472 --> 00:25:13.808
You just have pets for fun
and companionship.


350
00:25:13.975 --> 00:25:16.561
You has me for companion on the ship.

351
00:25:16.728 --> 00:25:18.855
Yeah, well, Pig is better.

352
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.486
If cat is "Pig," what is your name?

353
00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:39.334
Gratuity Tucci.
But my friends call me "Tip."


354
00:25:39.751 --> 00:25:42.337
- Tip.
- I said "my friends."


355
00:25:42.504 --> 00:25:45.507
But we are friends.
All humans and Boov.


356
00:25:45.673 --> 00:25:47.175
Captain Smek has decided.

357
00:25:47.342 --> 00:25:48.426
Captain Smek is an idiot.

358
00:25:49.177 --> 00:25:50.345
Untrue!

359
00:25:50.512 --> 00:25:54.391
Captain Smek is genius
and best at running away.


360
00:25:55.183 --> 00:25:58.186
Have you not heard
the legend of the Shusher?


361
00:25:59.104 --> 00:26:02.607
<i>Long ago, our enemy, the Gorg...</i>

362
00:26:02.774 --> 00:26:05.443
<i>invited the Boov to a peace meeting.</i>

363
00:26:11.699 --> 00:26:14.661
<i>But Smek wisely fled in terror.</i>

364
00:26:14.828 --> 00:26:17.664
<i>And he took a great trophy: The Shusher.</i>

365
00:26:17.831 --> 00:26:19.040
Run away!

366
00:26:21.084 --> 00:26:23.002
<i>Why is it called the "Shusher"?</i>

367
00:26:23.795 --> 00:26:24.795
Shush!

368
00:26:25.797 --> 00:26:27.006
Whatever.

369
00:27:06.796 --> 00:27:08.006
Seriously?

370
00:27:08.173 --> 00:27:09.893
You guys had to
ruin the Statue Of Liberty?

371
00:27:10.049 --> 00:27:11.049
"Statue of Smek."

372
00:27:11.176 --> 00:27:13.011
You will not get away with this.

373
00:27:13.428 --> 00:27:14.428
Boov Patrol!

374
00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:15.722
They are looking for you!

375
00:27:15.889 --> 00:27:16.889
Oh, no.

376
00:27:32.238 --> 00:27:33.238
Oh, no!

377
00:27:34.908 --> 00:27:35.992
What's that?

378
00:27:40.038 --> 00:27:41.038
Hey!

379
00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:43.500
Don't distract the driver!

380
00:27:51.841 --> 00:27:54.594
Aha! Busta Lime.

381
00:27:56.054 --> 00:27:57.472
"Busta Lime."

382
00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:03.728
Owpain!

383
00:28:03.895 --> 00:28:04.938
Owpain.

384
00:28:20.703 --> 00:28:21.829
Okay. Pee break.

385
00:28:21.996 --> 00:28:23.373
I, too, has to break pee.

386
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.124
Or, as you calIs it, the "number one."

387
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:27.293
- We also has the "number two."
- Okay.


388
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.337
- And the "number three."
- Okay!


389
00:28:29.504 --> 00:28:31.548
It is a good thing I doos not
have to go the number three.


390
00:28:31.714 --> 00:28:33.341
It would not be safe for you.

391
00:28:34.259 --> 00:28:35.885
We only doos it once a year.

392
00:28:36.052 --> 00:28:37.428
I would not call it a holiday...

393
00:28:37.595 --> 00:28:40.056
- but you doos need to take the day off.
- That's enough!


394
00:28:42.183 --> 00:28:45.144
You can't come in here.
This is the girls' room.


395
00:28:54.904 --> 00:28:56.573
Do not eat the blue mints!

396
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.911
Thankfully, there is a
large bowl of lemonade.


397
00:29:04.414 --> 00:29:06.624
Do not drink the lemonade!

398
00:29:09.043 --> 00:29:10.420
Be out in a second.

399
00:29:10.587 --> 00:29:13.172
We're going to Paris!

400
00:29:14.882 --> 00:29:15.967
Going to see my mom!

401
00:29:19.053 --> 00:29:20.513
Takes your time!

402
00:29:26.603 --> 00:29:28.021
Ant-arc-tica.

403
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.356
Here I come!

404
00:29:30.523 --> 00:29:31.523
Fugitive Boov.

405
00:29:32.567 --> 00:29:34.027
Hold still for arresting!

406
00:29:34.193 --> 00:29:35.695
Best friend Kyle!

407
00:29:35.862 --> 00:29:37.196
I am not your friend!

408
00:29:37.363 --> 00:29:39.907
But I will be a hero Boov
for getting your password.


409
00:29:41.743 --> 00:29:44.996
Yes! You has in nick-time saved us!

410
00:29:47.498 --> 00:29:49.167
What is the purpose of your face?

411
00:29:50.001 --> 00:29:50.627
Owpain.

412
00:29:50.793 --> 00:29:52.211
You were gonna ditch me?

413
00:29:52.378 --> 00:29:53.378
- No!
- Liar!


414
00:29:53.504 --> 00:29:54.881
I never lie!

415
00:29:55.048 --> 00:29:56.048
Yes, you do!

416
00:29:56.466 --> 00:29:57.508
And you know how I know?

417
00:29:57.675 --> 00:30:01.054
Because every time you lie,
you turn green!


418
00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.722
I doos not. I...

419
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:04.389
<i>Poomp .</i>

420
00:30:06.851 --> 00:30:11.564
Open the door, you lying,
frog-faced squishy toy!


421
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.316
Stop! I need your...

422
00:30:15.735 --> 00:30:17.320
You promised to help me find my mom!

423
00:30:17.487 --> 00:30:18.988
Then I un-promise!

424
00:30:19.155 --> 00:30:20.698
That's not how it works!

425
00:30:21.199 --> 00:30:23.451
You have to help me get to Paris.

426
00:30:23.618 --> 00:30:25.453
I will not!

427
00:30:27.497 --> 00:30:28.956
Stop! I need your...

428
00:30:34.128 --> 00:30:35.171
I must hide!

429
00:30:35.338 --> 00:30:38.299
I am speaking the English at you.
Whyfor do you not understands me?


430
00:30:38.466 --> 00:30:41.594
I "understands." I just don't care.

431
00:30:42.345 --> 00:30:43.471
- Freezing!
- Look out!


432
00:30:52.063 --> 00:30:53.063
Come on!

433
00:30:55.274 --> 00:30:58.861
Stop! I need your password.

434
00:31:02.115 --> 00:31:02.782
No!

435
00:31:02.949 --> 00:31:03.949
Go!

436
00:31:22.343 --> 00:31:24.846
All I wanted was his password.

437
00:31:29.517 --> 00:31:32.395
This is not a sustainable friendship model.

438
00:31:58.045 --> 00:31:59.380
So...

439
00:31:59.547 --> 00:32:04.343
I assume by now
we have apprehended the fugitive.


440
00:32:04.677 --> 00:32:06.179
Anybody?

441
00:32:06.345 --> 00:32:08.264
You. The purple one.

442
00:32:10.975 --> 00:32:13.015
Not that purple. The other purple.
The other purple.


443
00:32:14.562 --> 00:32:15.562
That one.

444
00:32:15.563 --> 00:32:16.563
Yes, you!

445
00:32:16.939 --> 00:32:18.524
So, where is he?

446
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.193
We do not know, sir.

447
00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:22.695
What? This is number one disaster!

448
00:32:22.862 --> 00:32:25.198
His message must not reach the Gorg.

449
00:32:25.364 --> 00:32:28.910
This planet was hard to find,
and I will not abandon it!


450
00:32:29.076 --> 00:32:32.330
Someone fetch me my stress blankie.

451
00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:38.920
So soothing.

452
00:32:42.215 --> 00:32:43.925
Aha! Officer Kyle!

453
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:47.053
Now here is a Boov
who knows how to do his job.


454
00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.430
Tell me, you have found the fugitive?

455
00:32:49.597 --> 00:32:50.765
Yes.

456
00:32:50.932 --> 00:32:52.809
Joyful exclamation!

457
00:32:55.353 --> 00:32:56.938
And where is he?

458
00:32:58.439 --> 00:33:00.483
There is a tiny problem.

459
00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:06.489
"Tiny." As long as it's tiny, who cares?

460
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:09.784
Well, before I got the password...

461
00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.578
I erased him.

462
00:33:16.582 --> 00:33:19.585
<i>Come party. Come party. 
Come party.</i>

463
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.466
- Quit it!
- Sorry.


464
00:33:25.633 --> 00:33:27.760
Look, Paris is danger for both of us.

465
00:33:27.927 --> 00:33:29.971
It crawls with Boov.

466
00:33:30.137 --> 00:33:33.182
Doos you have a plan
for once we are get there?


467
00:33:33.349 --> 00:33:36.435
Not really. But I have hope.

468
00:33:37.103 --> 00:33:38.771
You are bad at math.

469
00:33:38.938 --> 00:33:39.689
Excuse me?

470
00:33:39.856 --> 00:33:41.607
I got an "A" in geometry.

471
00:33:41.774 --> 00:33:43.109
I am only saying...

472
00:33:43.276 --> 00:33:45.778
Boov are superior in this way.

473
00:33:46.112 --> 00:33:50.116
If probability for success
falls below 50%...


474
00:33:51.784 --> 00:33:54.328
Boov give up. You do not.

475
00:33:54.495 --> 00:33:55.495
Exactly!

476
00:33:56.372 --> 00:33:57.832
Enough with the ripping!

477
00:33:57.999 --> 00:33:59.292
Okay, okay.

478
00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:01.335
Tell you what. 
Let's have some tuneage.

479
00:34:08.968 --> 00:34:10.386
What is that?

480
00:34:10.553 --> 00:34:12.305
Boov song.

481
00:34:12.471 --> 00:34:14.473
It is called "Motionless and Obedient."

482
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.640
Very big hit.

483
00:34:15.641 --> 00:34:17.977
No, no, no! Not in my car.

484
00:34:18.144 --> 00:34:19.520
Driver gets to pick.

485
00:34:23.357 --> 00:34:26.152
This is not even music.
This is just noise.


486
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.164
Involuntary physical response.

487
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:41.751
You have tricked me into listening
to a debilitating sonic weapon.


488
00:34:41.918 --> 00:34:44.879
If you want humans to not hate you...

489
00:34:45.046 --> 00:34:47.423
you could start by liking
some of our stuff.


490
00:34:52.428 --> 00:34:55.056
Confusion. What is happening to my body?

491
00:34:55.222 --> 00:34:56.599
It's called dancing!

492
00:34:56.766 --> 00:34:58.684
Boov do not dancing!

493
00:34:58.851 --> 00:35:01.354
I can tell.
But you're getting the hang of it!


494
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.356
How long before this kills me?

495
00:35:03.522 --> 00:35:06.108
I am not in
control of my own extremities!

496
00:35:06.275 --> 00:35:08.402
That's it. Work it!

497
00:35:08.569 --> 00:35:09.862
I do not want it to work!

498
00:35:10.029 --> 00:35:11.029
You know what?

499
00:35:11.572 --> 00:35:13.366
"Boov" rhymes with "groove."

500
00:35:13.532 --> 00:35:15.451
Shake your Boov thang.

501
00:35:16.035 --> 00:35:18.204
It is shaking in a most undignified way!

502
00:35:19.038 --> 00:35:22.541
Oh, no! My hands are in the air
like I just do not care!


503
00:35:22.875 --> 00:35:24.794
This is not how a Boov behaves!

504
00:35:24.961 --> 00:35:26.587
I am overheated with shame!

505
00:35:26.754 --> 00:35:28.547
- I must cool my core!
- Wait!


506
00:35:28.714 --> 00:35:31.133
- What are you doing?
- I will returning!


507
00:35:31.884 --> 00:35:33.094
We were having fun!

508
00:35:33.886 --> 00:35:34.887
Oh!

509
00:35:40.601 --> 00:35:41.602
Oh?

510
00:35:52.238 --> 00:35:53.906
<i>Come on, Mom. 
It's just snow!</i>

511
00:35:54.073 --> 00:35:55.992
<i>I don't know anything about snow.</i>

512
00:35:57.076 --> 00:35:58.327
<i>Our first snow!</i>

513
00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.748
<i>Are you okay?</i>

514
00:36:02.915 --> 00:36:04.083
<i>I'm sending this to...</i>

515
00:36:05.292 --> 00:36:07.128
My temperature is back to happiness.

516
00:36:07.294 --> 00:36:10.589
And to show I do not hold against you
any grudge-ment...


517
00:36:10.756 --> 00:36:13.342
I have brought you delicious snacking.

518
00:36:13.509 --> 00:36:15.594
Fa-da! Chewy plastic rings!

519
00:36:18.264 --> 00:36:20.808
I really do not enjoy
your human gratitude customs.


520
00:36:20.975 --> 00:36:22.101
Where have you been?

521
00:36:22.268 --> 00:36:23.436
You were gone forever!

522
00:36:23.602 --> 00:36:25.271
That is not accurate. "Forever" is...

523
00:36:25.438 --> 00:36:27.648
I thought you were dead! Or hurt!

524
00:36:27.815 --> 00:36:29.775
Or I don't know!

525
00:36:29.942 --> 00:36:32.695
But you cannot just leave
someone alone like that!


526
00:36:32.862 --> 00:36:34.822
Put yourself in my shoes!

527
00:36:34.989 --> 00:36:36.699
How could I wears your shoes?

528
00:36:36.866 --> 00:36:38.159
My pods are too small.

529
00:36:38.325 --> 00:36:39.535
It's an expression!

530
00:36:39.702 --> 00:36:42.955
It means try to feel how
someone else feels.


531
00:36:43.122 --> 00:36:47.043
I'm just a kid. I'm not supposed to be
by myself all the time.


532
00:36:47.209 --> 00:36:50.963
This is child endangerment.
Which is a crime, by the way.


533
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.632
But when I founded you,
you were already alone...


534
00:36:53.799 --> 00:36:55.551
so I thinks it is normal for you.

535
00:36:55.718 --> 00:36:58.220
When Boov are young,
we are kept in the warming oven.


536
00:37:04.643 --> 00:37:06.979
Is this normal for humanspersons?

537
00:37:07.146 --> 00:37:12.151
Usually, we don't cross the Atlantic
by ourselves until we're 16.


538
00:37:12.568 --> 00:37:14.487
No, none of this is normal!

539
00:37:14.653 --> 00:37:17.531
Don't you get it? 
You ruined everything!

540
00:37:17.698 --> 00:37:21.911
I was finally happy here...
There, where I lived.


541
00:37:22.078 --> 00:37:23.412
With my mom.

542
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:26.207
Do you know how hard it was
for me to fit in?


543
00:37:26.373 --> 00:37:27.833
How long that took?

544
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.169
7th-grade girls are mean!

545
00:37:30.336 --> 00:37:32.505
Yes, I sees that! 
I did not realize!

546
00:37:32.671 --> 00:37:36.008
We will resume the finding of Mimom.

547
00:37:36.175 --> 00:37:37.885
Stop saying that!

548
00:37:38.052 --> 00:37:40.429
She's just "my" mom.

549
00:37:40.596 --> 00:37:42.681
Not yours. Mine.

550
00:37:42.848 --> 00:37:45.267
How do you not understand this?

551
00:37:45.434 --> 00:37:48.938
How would you feel if some horrible aliens
took your mother from you?


552
00:37:50.189 --> 00:37:52.024
That could not to happen.

553
00:37:52.191 --> 00:37:54.193
Boov are not having mimoms.

554
00:37:55.778 --> 00:37:58.072
Boov don't have families.

555
00:37:59.365 --> 00:38:02.201
No wonder you take things
and don't care about anybody else.


556
00:38:07.206 --> 00:38:10.042
So, your mimom...

557
00:38:10.209 --> 00:38:13.045
is a very important humansperson to you.

558
00:38:13.212 --> 00:38:15.881
More important than others.

559
00:38:16.048 --> 00:38:20.094
To not belong with her
causes you being sad.


560
00:38:23.889 --> 00:38:27.393
But recent moments ago,
you are kicking on me and yelling.


561
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.564
Which is seeming more to be
mad than sad.


562
00:38:32.356 --> 00:38:35.776
Well, sometimes it's both.

563
00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:40.364
So, you are sad-mad.

564
00:38:52.918 --> 00:38:56.297
Humans are more complicated
than it said in the pamphlet.


565
00:39:03.637 --> 00:39:05.472
I vacuumed here as fast as I could.

566
00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:09.268
Whatfor is your plan for figuring out
the dumb Boov's password?


567
00:39:09.602 --> 00:39:10.769
I got nothing!

568
00:39:11.937 --> 00:39:14.064
Please, come on! I need ideas!

569
00:39:14.231 --> 00:39:16.233
You! The purple one.

570
00:39:19.153 --> 00:39:20.779
Oh, come on!

571
00:39:21.947 --> 00:39:22.948
So?

572
00:39:23.115 --> 00:39:28.078
We could type in random
numbers and letters?


573
00:39:29.163 --> 00:39:30.289
I like it!

574
00:39:31.457 --> 00:39:34.126
Get those big brains
plugged in and working.


575
00:39:34.293 --> 00:39:35.461
Away!

576
00:39:36.462 --> 00:39:38.839
You know what the Gorg will do
if they find us.


577
00:39:39.006 --> 00:39:40.090
Chomp, chomp, chomp.

578
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.764
<i>And that is why we keep running away.</i>

579
00:39:47.306 --> 00:39:48.306
Whoa.

580
00:39:48.432 --> 00:39:50.351
Why do these Gorg hate you so much?

581
00:39:50.517 --> 00:39:51.769
Because they are Gorg.

582
00:39:51.936 --> 00:39:54.271
We calls Gorg the "takers"...

583
00:39:54.438 --> 00:39:57.650
because if you has something,
they takes it.


584
00:39:57.816 --> 00:39:59.610
Like, if you has a sandwich.

585
00:39:59.777 --> 00:40:00.945
Or a planet.

586
00:40:01.111 --> 00:40:02.947
No, no. I get it.

587
00:40:03.113 --> 00:40:04.990
But they're not coming
to this planet, right?


588
00:40:05.157 --> 00:40:06.700
Oh, no, no. Not to worry.

589
00:40:06.867 --> 00:40:10.162
The Big Brain Boov
will to fix my mistake.

590
00:40:10.329 --> 00:40:12.164
But I will still be very punished.

591
00:40:12.331 --> 00:40:13.958
We has a rule.

592
00:40:14.124 --> 00:40:16.543
Nine mistakes and you are out.

593
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.504
How many mistakes do you have?

594
00:40:19.213 --> 00:40:20.464
62.

595
00:40:24.843 --> 00:40:28.305
When I'm stressed out,
my mom tells me jokes.


596
00:40:28.806 --> 00:40:31.183
Boov do not do telling jokes.

597
00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.143
It's not that hard. 
I'll teach you.

598
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:34.310
Knock, knock.

599
00:40:35.479 --> 00:40:37.523
You would say, "Who's there?"

600
00:40:39.858 --> 00:40:41.026
You are there.

601
00:40:41.193 --> 00:40:42.695
No, just ask me.

602
00:40:42.861 --> 00:40:43.861
Who is there?

603
00:40:43.862 --> 00:40:46.490
Now I say, "The interrupting cow."

604
00:40:46.657 --> 00:40:49.535
Now you say, "The interrupting cow, who?"

605
00:40:49.702 --> 00:40:50.703
Let's just do it.

606
00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:53.163
- Knock, knock.
- Who is there?


607
00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.082
The interrupting cow.

608
00:40:55.249 --> 00:40:57.668
- The interrupting cow...
- Moo!


609
00:40:57.835 --> 00:40:59.878
You did not let me finish my response.

610
00:41:00.045 --> 00:41:03.048
- I was to say, "The interrupting co..."
- Moo!


611
00:41:03.215 --> 00:41:04.758
You did it again.

612
00:41:07.052 --> 00:41:08.721
That is the joke.

613
00:41:08.887 --> 00:41:11.724
The cow is to being an interrupting cow...

614
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.892
and therefore interrupts me!

615
00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:16.353
- I know. That's why it's funny.
- Moo!


616
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.105
- Let me fi...
- Moo!


617
00:41:18.272 --> 00:41:19.992
- That's enough.
- I'm the interrupting cow.


618
00:41:20.024 --> 00:41:21.567
- Knock it off!
- Moo!


619
00:41:21.734 --> 00:41:23.777
- Don't make me get out more tape!
- Moo!


620
00:41:32.244 --> 00:41:34.621
So many Boovs!

621
00:41:35.372 --> 00:41:36.749
I said this was dumbness.

622
00:41:36.915 --> 00:41:39.543
I said I am doomed.
But doos you listen? No!


623
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:40.710
Oh, that's enough!

624
00:41:40.753 --> 00:41:42.588
You are driving me to the crazy!

625
00:41:42.755 --> 00:41:45.966
It is never too late to run away.
That is the Boov motto.


626
00:41:46.592 --> 00:41:48.927
Yes, but we're not doing that.
I have a plan.


627
00:41:49.094 --> 00:41:52.097
Is your plan to run away?
Because other-way-wise, it is stupid!


628
00:41:52.264 --> 00:41:54.058
All we have to do
is sneak into the city...


629
00:41:54.224 --> 00:41:57.061
get into the Great Antenna,
use it to find my mom...


630
00:41:57.227 --> 00:41:59.271
and then sneak out again. See?

631
00:41:59.438 --> 00:42:02.483
But it still will not work
because my face is known.


632
00:42:02.649 --> 00:42:07.112
If I am seen by any Boov,
I am 100% popular for being arrested.


633
00:42:08.781 --> 00:42:10.449
What if I could fix that?

634
00:42:25.631 --> 00:42:26.673
Hold still.

635
00:42:28.258 --> 00:42:30.803
First, a little beauty mark.

636
00:42:31.637 --> 00:42:33.138
Letting me see.

637
00:42:33.305 --> 00:42:35.545
- Not yet. Give me that mirror.
- Give to me, give to me!


638
00:42:38.143 --> 00:42:41.146
It is like looking at a completed stranger!

639
00:42:41.313 --> 00:42:43.273
No, I'm not done. 
It's not even...

640
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.485
You are a worker of
miraculous transformation!


641
00:42:46.652 --> 00:42:48.112
Who is this Boov?

642
00:42:48.278 --> 00:42:49.696
I do not know!

643
00:42:50.823 --> 00:42:52.032
All right, Oh.

644
00:42:54.493 --> 00:42:55.494
Owpain.

645
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.682
<i>Express elevator departing.</i>

646
00:43:30.362 --> 00:43:31.362
Whoa!

647
00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.532
This is uber freaky.

648
00:43:33.699 --> 00:43:36.201
These are the smartest Boov you have?

649
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.912
You must be very quiet.

650
00:43:39.079 --> 00:43:40.799
You do not want to break their concentra...

651
00:43:43.667 --> 00:43:44.751
<i>Come party. 
Come party.</i>

652
00:43:46.545 --> 00:43:47.588
Oh! What is it?

653
00:43:47.754 --> 00:43:50.757
I thought the Big Brain Boovs
would have stopped my invitation by now.


654
00:43:50.924 --> 00:43:52.804
But they have still not
figured out my password.


655
00:43:52.885 --> 00:43:54.445
- How is this possible?
- Wait a minute.


656
00:43:54.595 --> 00:43:57.514
Does this mean those horrible monster
Gorg thingies will come to Earth?


657
00:43:57.681 --> 00:43:59.099
To Smekland, yes!

658
00:43:59.266 --> 00:44:00.517
And what happens then?

659
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.022
There will be no finding of Mimom!

660
00:44:05.939 --> 00:44:07.399
Then you've gotta fix this!

661
00:44:07.566 --> 00:44:08.859
Yes.

662
00:44:10.235 --> 00:44:11.361
Hurry!

663
00:44:11.528 --> 00:44:13.280
By to the way, is your skull flexible?

664
00:44:13.447 --> 00:44:14.239
- What?
- Never mind.


665
00:44:14.406 --> 00:44:15.846
It will be probably okay.
Hold still.


666
00:44:28.962 --> 00:44:30.130
Wow!

667
00:44:34.134 --> 00:44:35.761
30 seconds to doom.

668
00:44:35.928 --> 00:44:37.804
I shall input my password. It is...

669
00:44:37.971 --> 00:44:40.331
"My name is Oh and Captain
Smek is great and


670
00:44:40.343 --> 00:44:42.768
anyone who does not think
that is a poomp 1."


671
00:44:42.935 --> 00:44:44.436
I wonder why no one guessed that.

672
00:44:44.603 --> 00:44:45.729
I do not know.

673
00:44:47.439 --> 00:44:48.982
- It didn't work?
- Impossible!


674
00:44:49.149 --> 00:44:50.149
That is password!

675
00:44:50.234 --> 00:44:52.402
That is... Oh, no! Caps Lock.

676
00:44:59.785 --> 00:45:00.825
Come on, come on, come on!

677
00:45:00.827 --> 00:45:03.121
<i>Come party. Come party.
Come party. Come party.</i>


678
00:45:05.958 --> 00:45:07.417
<i>Come party. 
Come party.</i>

679
00:45:19.972 --> 00:45:20.973
Yes!

680
00:45:27.646 --> 00:45:29.648
Fa-da! It has worked.

681
00:45:29.815 --> 00:45:31.108
It worked!

682
00:45:31.275 --> 00:45:32.484
You did it, Oh!

683
00:45:35.988 --> 00:45:37.281
That was closeness.

684
00:45:37.447 --> 00:45:38.447
On your feet.

685
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.325
You still have to find my mom.

686
00:45:40.492 --> 00:45:43.537
That is simplicity.
We shall now searching on...


687
00:45:43.704 --> 00:45:45.330
Lucy Tucci.

688
00:45:45.497 --> 00:45:47.457
"Lucy Tucci."

689
00:45:49.334 --> 00:45:51.044
Australia.

690
00:45:54.506 --> 00:45:56.341
Observe Mimom.

691
00:45:58.051 --> 00:45:59.344
That's not funny.

692
00:45:59.511 --> 00:46:00.887
This is not your mimom?

693
00:46:01.054 --> 00:46:02.054
Are you kidding?

694
00:46:02.639 --> 00:46:04.516
That's not her!

695
00:46:04.975 --> 00:46:06.059
Sure?

696
00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.395
<i>I know, I know. Okay?</i>

697
00:46:08.562 --> 00:46:10.082
<i>You've been saying that for two weeks.</i>

698
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:11.231
<i>Please!</i>

699
00:46:11.398 --> 00:46:14.901
<i>She has big green eyes
and beautiful brown skin.</i>


700
00:46:15.068 --> 00:46:16.194
Mom.

701
00:46:17.362 --> 00:46:18.989
<i>So tell me where she is.</i>

702
00:46:19.156 --> 00:46:21.074
<i>Or find me a Boov who can.</i>

703
00:46:23.493 --> 00:46:24.494
<i>Please.</i>

704
00:46:25.412 --> 00:46:28.749
Gratuity Tucci looks just like tiny Mimom.

705
00:46:30.876 --> 00:46:32.544
Gratuity Tucci? Whyfor...

706
00:46:32.711 --> 00:46:35.672
Thank you! Thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!


707
00:46:41.553 --> 00:46:44.222
I can't believe it!
My mom's in Australia!


708
00:46:44.389 --> 00:46:46.767
And I has cancelled my e-vite!

709
00:46:46.933 --> 00:46:48.935
I can finally come out of the hiding.

710
00:46:49.102 --> 00:46:50.103
Yes!

711
00:47:01.073 --> 00:47:03.283
Well, well, well.

712
00:47:05.619 --> 00:47:06.703
Hello?

713
00:47:07.537 --> 00:47:08.538
Hold my crown.

714
00:47:08.705 --> 00:47:10.707
And be very careful.
It's the only one.


715
00:47:11.416 --> 00:47:13.043
Well, well, well.

716
00:47:13.877 --> 00:47:16.129
Did you really think you could escape?

717
00:47:16.296 --> 00:47:19.633
Escape? No, no, no.

718
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.134
You see, I was
just coming to tell you...

719
00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:23.553
Despite your elaborate disguise...

720
00:47:24.096 --> 00:47:26.765
the computer recognized you as...

721
00:47:26.932 --> 00:47:29.267
the fugitive Boov!

722
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.898
But he's a hero Boov now!

723
00:47:35.065 --> 00:47:37.651
Yes! I has fixed my mistake!

724
00:47:37.818 --> 00:47:40.445
Yes, but before that,
you has made your mistake.


725
00:47:40.612 --> 00:47:42.823
And many mistakes before that.

726
00:47:42.989 --> 00:47:46.284
- Wait, I have not...
- Many, many, many, many!


727
00:47:46.451 --> 00:47:49.788
Actually...
Many mistakes before that.


728
00:47:50.497 --> 00:47:52.457
- So, I still has to erase you.
- Why?


729
00:47:52.624 --> 00:47:54.824
You cannot guarantee
you would not make a mistake again.


730
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.796
- But I would not.
- But you might.


731
00:47:57.963 --> 00:47:58.755
But I would not.

732
00:47:58.922 --> 00:48:00.340
We could go round and round.
Let's do it again!


733
00:48:00.507 --> 00:48:01.633
- But I would not.
- But you might.


734
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.593
- But I would not.
- I love this!


735
00:48:05.137 --> 00:48:07.764
- But I would not!
- Bored now.


736
00:48:07.931 --> 00:48:08.974
- But I would...
- Shush!


737
00:48:09.141 --> 00:48:10.141
Erase him!

738
00:48:12.602 --> 00:48:14.813
Drop the bubble guns!

739
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.315
Or I will mess with this...

740
00:48:17.774 --> 00:48:19.609
gravity thingy.

741
00:48:19.776 --> 00:48:21.027
She is bluffing.

742
00:48:21.319 --> 00:48:24.114
She could not possibly reach
the gravity thingy.


743
00:48:25.157 --> 00:48:27.367
Curse you and your tippy-toe tallness!

744
00:48:28.326 --> 00:48:29.327
But no problem.

745
00:48:29.494 --> 00:48:34.833
Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out.


746
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.334
Excuse me?

747
00:48:38.003 --> 00:48:41.006
This humansgirl got an "A" in geometry.

748
00:48:44.676 --> 00:48:47.471
She figured it out!
Run for my life!


749
00:48:49.139 --> 00:48:51.183
Out of my way! I am captain!

750
00:49:06.364 --> 00:49:07.365
Grab on!

751
00:49:08.325 --> 00:49:09.576
Oh, no! I can't hold you!

752
00:49:10.327 --> 00:49:12.078
You weigh, like, a thousand pounds!

753
00:49:13.205 --> 00:49:13.872
Let go.

754
00:49:14.039 --> 00:49:15.874
- What?
- Trust me.


755
00:49:22.506 --> 00:49:24.549
Sorry. It is my
duty to run away first.

756
00:49:26.384 --> 00:49:27.052
Poomp.

757
00:49:27.219 --> 00:49:29.054
- What are you waiting for?
- I cannot touch.


758
00:49:29.221 --> 00:49:30.722
It will not work if I drive it.

759
00:49:31.556 --> 00:49:33.016
Fine. I'll drive.

760
00:49:38.688 --> 00:49:39.688
Owpain.

761
00:49:43.735 --> 00:49:45.320
You are terrible driver.

762
00:50:11.513 --> 00:50:12.514
Come on.

763
00:50:13.557 --> 00:50:14.891
Come on. Come on.

764
00:50:15.725 --> 00:50:16.268
Bon appétit.

765
00:50:16.393 --> 00:50:17.561
Oh, no, you don't!

766
00:50:17.727 --> 00:50:19.229
I am not paying for that.

767
00:50:37.581 --> 00:50:39.457
Come on, you stupid horse!

768
00:50:47.591 --> 00:50:48.925
Whoo, that was cl...

769
00:50:59.477 --> 00:51:00.478
This time I got you...

770
00:51:00.645 --> 00:51:02.314
and you cannot escape.

771
00:51:03.064 --> 00:51:04.149
<i>Fugitive Boov detected.</i>

772
00:51:04.316 --> 00:51:05.316
I was wrong.

773
00:51:10.488 --> 00:51:11.488
Jump!

774
00:51:11.615 --> 00:51:12.616
Oh, no!

775
00:51:24.836 --> 00:51:26.588
Look! I has found our car.

776
00:51:26.755 --> 00:51:27.756
Pig!

777
00:51:37.098 --> 00:51:39.351
I do not know whyfor you brought that.

778
00:51:39.517 --> 00:51:41.186
We already hads food in the car.

779
00:51:41.353 --> 00:51:43.355
It's not food, it's art.

780
00:51:44.439 --> 00:51:45.857
Then it is bad.

781
00:51:46.024 --> 00:51:48.151
Stars do not look like that.

782
00:51:48.318 --> 00:51:49.694
It's not about how they look.

783
00:51:49.861 --> 00:51:51.988
It's about how they feel.

784
00:51:52.364 --> 00:51:53.949
They feel hot.

785
00:51:55.116 --> 00:51:58.203
Okay, math whiz, how long
till we get to Australia?


786
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.538
17.9348 hours.

787
00:52:01.039 --> 00:52:04.334
And then, Gratuity Tucci...
will see Mimom.


788
00:52:06.962 --> 00:52:08.046
You hear that, Pig?

789
00:52:08.213 --> 00:52:10.882
I can't wait to tell Mom
I actually went to Paris...


790
00:52:11.049 --> 00:52:13.218
which you know she always wanted to do.

791
00:52:13.385 --> 00:52:15.387
Maybe we could both come back here.

792
00:52:15.553 --> 00:52:17.472
We do have a flying car now.

793
00:52:17.639 --> 00:52:20.225
How do you say "cat" in French?

794
00:52:20.725 --> 00:52:22.519
I think it's "chat."

795
00:52:32.696 --> 00:52:34.823
What is the purpose of your face?

796
00:52:38.535 --> 00:52:40.370
I has confusion.

797
00:52:42.038 --> 00:52:44.582
I do not wish to be erased.

798
00:52:45.417 --> 00:52:47.919
But maybe Captain Smek is right.

799
00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:52.716
It is possible I will continue
making hilarious mistakes.


800
00:52:53.258 --> 00:52:54.259
Probably.

801
00:52:54.426 --> 00:52:56.428
That is not making me feel better.

802
00:52:56.594 --> 00:52:58.263
Nobody's perfect.

803
00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:02.767
My mom says your mistakes
are what make you human.


804
00:53:02.934 --> 00:53:05.228
That is not what makes you Boov.

805
00:53:08.398 --> 00:53:12.277
Gratuity Tucci...
before we came...


806
00:53:12.444 --> 00:53:16.156
Captain Smek telled us
that the humans needed us.


807
00:53:16.656 --> 00:53:19.492
That the humans were
just like the animals...


808
00:53:19.659 --> 00:53:21.953
and that we could to make them better...

809
00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.872
teach to them.

810
00:53:24.039 --> 00:53:29.044
We were told the humans
were simple and backwards.


811
00:53:30.795 --> 00:53:33.089
It is what we thought.

812
00:53:33.465 --> 00:53:34.632
But I am thinking now...

813
00:53:36.009 --> 00:53:38.470
that we were thinking wrong.

814
00:53:38.636 --> 00:53:41.556
And that Captain Smek is the wrongest.

815
00:53:41.723 --> 00:53:46.102
I am thinking the Boov
should never have come to Smekland.


816
00:53:46.269 --> 00:53:48.605
To Earthland.

817
00:53:49.105 --> 00:53:53.026
So I am saying
the sorry to you...


818
00:53:53.193 --> 00:53:54.819
Gratuity Tucci.

819
00:54:03.828 --> 00:54:05.955
Call me Tip.

820
00:54:11.336 --> 00:54:15.256
It was a new home, a new country.

821
00:54:15.423 --> 00:54:17.133
I tried to make friends at school...

822
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:21.137
but I was this nerd from Barbados.

823
00:54:21.304 --> 00:54:24.349
But you dids to get
an "A" in geometry.


824
00:54:24.516 --> 00:54:26.059
Yeah, I did.

825
00:54:26.684 --> 00:54:29.521
I know when the other Boovs said "Oh"...

826
00:54:29.687 --> 00:54:32.232
they were not happy to see me.

827
00:54:33.817 --> 00:54:36.903
The true is, among Boov,
I do not fit in.


828
00:54:37.779 --> 00:54:39.239
I fit out.

829
00:54:42.158 --> 00:54:44.327
She is so amazing.

830
00:54:44.494 --> 00:54:46.621
She saved up everything she had...

831
00:54:46.788 --> 00:54:49.749
so we could move
and things would be better for us.


832
00:54:50.083 --> 00:54:52.961
I cannot wait to meet Mimom.

833
00:54:57.924 --> 00:55:00.760
"My name is Captain Smek.
Shush, shush, shush."


834
00:55:00.927 --> 00:55:06.432
"Boov technology is far too complicated
for simple humansgirl to figure out."


835
00:56:33.978 --> 00:56:35.063
How did they find us?

836
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:36.481
I do not know!

837
00:56:43.154 --> 00:56:45.198
Wait. They're not attacking.

838
00:56:45.365 --> 00:56:47.408
Because they are running away.

839
00:56:48.576 --> 00:56:49.994
Why are they running away?

840
00:56:50.161 --> 00:56:51.913
There can only be one reason.

841
00:57:05.134 --> 00:57:06.134
Gorg.

842
00:57:06.636 --> 00:57:09.472
This makes no sense.
I stopped the message.


843
00:57:10.431 --> 00:57:11.808
Gorg cannot to finding us.

844
00:57:12.517 --> 00:57:13.810
Then how did they?

845
00:57:13.977 --> 00:57:16.187
There must be some other reason!

846
00:57:20.608 --> 00:57:22.110
Oh, behind us!

847
00:57:22.277 --> 00:57:24.028
Engage weapons system.

848
00:57:24.195 --> 00:57:25.697
We have a weapons system?

849
00:57:30.493 --> 00:57:32.745
Go, Burrito Torpedo!

850
00:57:35.331 --> 00:57:36.331
Yes!

851
00:57:38.251 --> 00:57:41.004
We've been hit!
We're losing Grape Escape!


852
00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:42.588
We lost Tangerine Twist!

853
00:57:42.755 --> 00:57:45.800
If we lose Busta Lime, 
I cannot control!

854
00:57:46.009 --> 00:57:47.760
Click and ticket.
We are to crash!


855
00:57:47.927 --> 00:57:48.927
Oh!

856
00:58:06.738 --> 00:58:07.738
No, no, no.

857
00:58:08.072 --> 00:58:09.407
Slushious! No!

858
00:58:11.784 --> 00:58:13.369
Don't just stand there! Help!

859
00:58:14.912 --> 00:58:16.581
Come on, come on, come on!

860
00:58:16.748 --> 00:58:19.083
Slushious! No!

861
00:58:26.382 --> 00:58:27.133
She's gone.

862
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.301
We are doomed.

863
00:58:28.468 --> 00:58:29.969
Now I'll never make it to Australia.

864
00:58:30.136 --> 00:58:32.263
I will now sing the Boov Death Song.

865
00:58:41.105 --> 00:58:42.148
A Gorg ship!

866
00:58:42.315 --> 00:58:43.875
It is rude to interrupt the Death Song.

867
00:58:43.941 --> 00:58:46.903
Maybe you could take the
parts from it to fix our car.


868
00:58:47.153 --> 00:58:49.989
I cannot. Those are Gorg parts.
They are metric.


869
00:58:50.156 --> 00:58:52.658
We're not getting this close
and giving up.


870
00:58:52.825 --> 00:58:53.910
- Come on.
- No!


871
00:58:54.911 --> 00:58:56.120
Always with the running towards danger.

872
00:58:56.412 --> 00:58:59.665
Stop being such a Boov.
It's our only chance. Come on.


873
00:59:02.752 --> 00:59:05.338
This has low probability of success!

874
00:59:12.261 --> 00:59:13.805
- Let's go.
- Wait!


875
00:59:14.097 --> 00:59:15.139
For what?

876
00:59:15.598 --> 00:59:17.266
For you to change your mind.

877
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.601
Come on.

878
00:59:35.159 --> 00:59:36.160
There's no pilot.

879
00:59:36.327 --> 00:59:37.954
It is just a drone.

880
00:59:41.541 --> 00:59:43.042
That could have been badness.

881
00:59:43.209 --> 00:59:44.710
But we are not safety.

882
00:59:44.877 --> 00:59:47.296
Gorg mothership will be here
soon enough.


883
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:50.842
Can you use any of this?

884
00:59:51.008 --> 00:59:52.218
Broken.

885
00:59:52.385 --> 00:59:53.511
Useless.

886
00:59:53.678 --> 00:59:55.680
Likely to cause thermonuclear fission.

887
00:59:58.641 --> 01:00:00.017
What is it?

888
01:00:00.351 --> 01:00:01.477
It is Gorg super-chip!

889
01:00:03.688 --> 01:00:05.523
Why is it called a super-chip?

890
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:06.858
It is mostly marketing.

891
01:00:07.024 --> 01:00:08.693
But it is key...

892
01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:12.530
for the Gorg are having machines
that are stronger and better at everything.


893
01:00:12.697 --> 01:00:14.699
So we can never fight them with equaltude.

894
01:00:14.866 --> 01:00:16.367
Can we use it to fix Slushious?

895
01:00:16.534 --> 01:00:18.828
Yes, yes! The Slushious will fly again.

896
01:00:18.995 --> 01:00:20.037
Yes!

897
01:00:29.088 --> 01:00:31.757
It was low probability of success.

898
01:00:31.924 --> 01:00:33.885
Some Boov you are.

899
01:00:35.678 --> 01:00:36.678
Quickly.

900
01:00:36.762 --> 01:00:38.681
We must fix the Slushious
and find Mimom.


901
01:00:38.848 --> 01:00:39.891
"My" mom.

902
01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:41.225
That is the thing I said.

903
01:00:41.392 --> 01:00:43.686
I knew this would all work out!

904
01:00:47.064 --> 01:00:48.774
You were awesome!

905
01:00:48.941 --> 01:00:50.067
We're gonna find my mom...

906
01:00:50.234 --> 01:00:53.070
you're gonna show everybody
the super-chip and be a big hero...


907
01:00:53.237 --> 01:00:55.615
and even Captain Smek will have to...

908
01:00:58.701 --> 01:01:00.745
That's a lot of people.

909
01:01:07.043 --> 01:01:08.377
- Bye, Boov!
- Get lost!


910
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:24.810
Wow. You guys really are good
at running away.


911
01:01:24.977 --> 01:01:25.978
Yes.

912
01:01:26.771 --> 01:01:28.105
Yes, we are.

913
01:01:36.614 --> 01:01:37.614
Look, over there!

914
01:01:37.657 --> 01:01:39.283
That's where we saw my mom!

915
01:01:48.793 --> 01:01:50.336
Hurry up, it is the last ship!

916
01:01:54.131 --> 01:01:56.467
It's okay, Pig.
I'll be back with Mom.


917
01:02:00.346 --> 01:02:01.346
We're almost there!

918
01:02:01.347 --> 01:02:02.347
Over here.

919
01:02:02.348 --> 01:02:03.432
- What?
- Hurry!


920
01:02:10.606 --> 01:02:13.192
I don't understand.
She's in there?


921
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:16.820
Yes.

922
01:02:18.781 --> 01:02:19.865
Tell me the truth.

923
01:02:20.032 --> 01:02:21.367
There is no time.

924
01:02:21.534 --> 01:02:23.160
You can come with me.

925
01:02:23.327 --> 01:02:25.621
You will be safety.

926
01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:30.459
My mom's not on that ship, is she?

927
01:02:32.461 --> 01:02:35.506
You promised to help me find her,
and you're leaving?


928
01:02:37.049 --> 01:02:38.884
- You lied to me.
- No!


929
01:02:39.051 --> 01:02:41.137
A lie is a bad thing.

930
01:02:41.304 --> 01:02:43.389
I did a thing so you can live.

931
01:02:43.556 --> 01:02:46.017
I'm not going. 
My mom is here.

932
01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:47.518
You will never find her.

933
01:02:47.685 --> 01:02:49.061
It is 100%.

934
01:02:49.228 --> 01:02:51.689
Staying now does not make hope.

935
01:02:51.856 --> 01:02:53.899
Gorg mothership will be here soon.

936
01:02:54.859 --> 01:02:56.193
It destroys planets.

937
01:02:57.028 --> 01:02:58.988
- We must run away now!
- No!


938
01:02:59.155 --> 01:03:00.406
It is true.

939
01:03:00.573 --> 01:03:04.035
Humanspersons cannot even understand
simple, simple things.


940
01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:06.746
I am saving you!
I am being your friend.


941
01:03:06.912 --> 01:03:09.373
No, you're just running away.

942
01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.834
You don't leave your family.

943
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:13.281
But you can't understand that...

944
01:03:13.377 --> 01:03:15.546
because you're just a Boov!

945
01:03:16.756 --> 01:03:19.592
You've never been my friend.

946
01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:28.391
Wait!

947
01:03:28.517 --> 01:03:30.686
<i>Final escape pod departing.</i>

948
01:04:12.978 --> 01:04:16.148
I hate upon the Gorg!
They are always finding us!


949
01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:17.733
The Gorg mothership!

950
01:04:35.292 --> 01:04:36.085
We are doomed!

951
01:04:36.252 --> 01:04:37.252
Run away!

952
01:04:37.294 --> 01:04:38.963
Make a path, I'm holding a baby.

953
01:04:47.012 --> 01:04:48.931
It is the fugitive Boov!

954
01:04:49.098 --> 01:04:51.142
He is running towards the danger!

955
01:04:51.475 --> 01:04:52.476
Stop him!

956
01:05:04.447 --> 01:05:05.656
Undo!

957
01:05:24.675 --> 01:05:27.511
Captain, we are achieving
new highest speeds!


958
01:05:28.804 --> 01:05:31.640
What has you done?
What is that thing?


959
01:05:32.183 --> 01:05:33.976
It is Gorg super-chip.

960
01:05:34.477 --> 01:05:35.477
What?

961
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:36.729
Gorg drone crashed...

962
01:05:36.896 --> 01:05:39.190
and I ran to it
and I found the chip.


963
01:05:39.356 --> 01:05:40.024
Enough.

964
01:05:40.191 --> 01:05:42.026
You ran to a Gorg?

965
01:05:43.527 --> 01:05:45.362
He runs towards the danger?

966
01:05:45.529 --> 01:05:46.864
What kind of Boov is he?

967
01:05:47.031 --> 01:05:49.992
He is like a Super Boov.

968
01:05:50.159 --> 01:05:52.203
No, no, no.

969
01:05:52.369 --> 01:05:53.996
He is not a Super Boov.

970
01:05:54.163 --> 01:05:58.000
There is only one Super Boov
on this ship, and you know who it is.


971
01:05:58.167 --> 01:05:59.543
You're looking at him.

972
01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:01.712
I invented running away.

973
01:06:01.879 --> 01:06:05.174
And look at this.
I have the Shusher.


974
01:06:05.424 --> 01:06:07.551
I am your captain.

975
01:06:07.718 --> 01:06:09.220
But you are not good captain.

976
01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:10.429
What?

977
01:06:10.596 --> 01:06:13.933
You telled us these things,
and we all believed them.


978
01:06:14.391 --> 01:06:15.893
I believed them.

979
01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:19.563
But then I met a humansperson.

980
01:06:20.397 --> 01:06:22.566
And she is not like you said.

981
01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.029
She is brave and smart...

982
01:06:27.196 --> 01:06:30.574
and cares about other humanspersons.

983
01:06:30.741 --> 01:06:34.912
In a way that we Boov
do not even care about each other.


984
01:06:36.956 --> 01:06:39.083
She even cares about me.

985
01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:42.253
And I've done very little to earn that.

986
01:06:43.254 --> 01:06:46.131
The Boov may be superior in many ways...

987
01:06:46.423 --> 01:06:47.423
Yeah.

988
01:06:47.424 --> 01:06:50.636
...but not in the ways that I now thinks
are most important.


989
01:06:55.099 --> 01:06:56.308
Big deal!

990
01:06:56.475 --> 01:06:57.726
I have had enough. Shush!

991
01:07:00.646 --> 01:07:03.816
That is enough shushing.

992
01:07:03.983 --> 01:07:05.818
How dare you shush a shushing!

993
01:07:05.985 --> 01:07:08.779
Oh is right.
We need a new captain.


994
01:07:09.238 --> 01:07:12.074
I thinks it should be Oh!

995
01:07:12.616 --> 01:07:14.285
Me? No.

996
01:07:14.451 --> 01:07:15.911
No! He cannot be captain.

997
01:07:16.078 --> 01:07:18.330
I have the Shusher. I am captain!

998
01:07:18.497 --> 01:07:19.497
Not anymore!

999
01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:23.252
He will not know how to operate it!

1000
01:07:23.419 --> 01:07:24.962
It is very complicated.

1001
01:07:25.129 --> 01:07:26.609
Heavy on one end, light on the other.

1002
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:27.631
Shush!

1003
01:07:28.632 --> 01:07:29.800
Booyah!

1004
01:07:30.301 --> 01:07:32.803
No, I am not a Leader Boov.

1005
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:34.305
I makes far too many mistakes.

1006
01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:37.600
You are not the only Boov
who makes mistakes.


1007
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:39.768
For examples...

1008
01:07:39.935 --> 01:07:43.480
my mistake is not being your friend.

1009
01:07:50.529 --> 01:07:52.656
All hail Captain Oh!

1010
01:07:55.326 --> 01:07:56.452
I saw who did that!

1011
01:07:56.619 --> 01:07:58.162
I hold grudges, you know!

1012
01:08:06.295 --> 01:08:07.630
Oh, you're the best!

1013
01:08:08.172 --> 01:08:10.299
Want me to host party, Oh?

1014
01:09:47.855 --> 01:09:49.690
Go away.

1015
01:09:50.107 --> 01:09:53.527
No, you are supposed to be saying
"Who is there?"


1016
01:09:53.694 --> 01:09:56.405
Then I am to be saying... "Moo!"

1017
01:09:56.572 --> 01:09:57.572
Oh!

1018
01:09:59.616 --> 01:10:01.910
I can't believe it!

1019
01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:04.121
But I saw your ship leave!

1020
01:10:06.957 --> 01:10:10.127
But you came back!
What are you doing here?


1021
01:10:10.294 --> 01:10:11.795
It is where I belongs.

1022
01:10:11.962 --> 01:10:14.757
You and Pigcat are my friends.

1023
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:19.136
And alsos, too... I
gave you a promise.


1024
01:11:41.176 --> 01:11:42.386
He's my friend.

1025
01:11:45.806 --> 01:11:46.890
Thank you.

1026
01:11:50.811 --> 01:11:51.979
Mom.

1027
01:11:56.024 --> 01:11:57.568
Tippy. My beautiful girl.

1028
01:11:57.734 --> 01:12:00.404
I've been looking everywhere, Mom.

1029
01:12:00.571 --> 01:12:03.198
I was so scared we'd never
see each other again.


1030
01:12:03.365 --> 01:12:06.493
Mom, I never would have stopped looking
until I found you.


1031
01:12:10.664 --> 01:12:12.583
They are still looking.

1032
01:12:29.224 --> 01:12:31.101
Gorg are not the takers.

1033
01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:33.437
Boov are.

1034
01:12:37.816 --> 01:12:40.319
We must demonstrate our affections later.

1035
01:12:40.485 --> 01:12:42.321
There is still one problem.

1036
01:12:42.487 --> 01:12:44.281
Excuse me, what is that?

1037
01:12:44.448 --> 01:12:47.284
That is Gorg mothership.
It is here to destroy the planet.


1038
01:12:52.539 --> 01:12:53.859
It's going to destroy the planet?

1039
01:12:53.999 --> 01:12:56.501
Yes. But I haves a plan.

1040
01:13:10.974 --> 01:13:12.100
Oh?

1041
01:13:15.187 --> 01:13:16.355
What are you doing?

1042
01:13:16.521 --> 01:13:18.023
I am sorry.

1043
01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:20.859
Tip cannot come into the out now.

1044
01:13:21.026 --> 01:13:22.986
I am fixing my mistake.

1045
01:13:23.487 --> 01:13:26.698
Oh! You can't do this on your own!

1046
01:13:26.865 --> 01:13:28.575
Maybe not.

1047
01:13:28.742 --> 01:13:30.786
But I haves hope.

1048
01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:34.790
No!

1049
01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:36.083
Stop, no!

1050
01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:38.669
Please don't do this by yourself!

1051
01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:45.926
No! Don't!

1052
01:13:47.052 --> 01:13:48.345
Oh!

1053
01:14:07.739 --> 01:14:10.242
Stop!

1054
01:14:13.787 --> 01:14:15.539
Look!

1055
01:14:21.753 --> 01:14:23.005
Hey!

1056
01:14:30.429 --> 01:14:32.139
Gorg!

1057
01:14:32.472 --> 01:14:34.975
It is useless to yell.

1058
01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:36.476
Gorg!

1059
01:14:45.819 --> 01:14:47.237
They're not gonna see him.

1060
01:14:47.404 --> 01:14:48.572
It's not gonna work!

1061
01:14:49.448 --> 01:14:50.490
Merry Christmas.

1062
01:14:50.657 --> 01:14:52.117
- Now?
- Just open it.


1063
01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.122
Thank you, sweetheart, but what...

1064
01:14:57.789 --> 01:14:58.540
What are you doing?

1065
01:14:58.707 --> 01:15:00.792
Distracting the driver.

1066
01:15:35.369 --> 01:15:37.579
It worked! The ship's stopping!

1067
01:15:45.128 --> 01:15:46.546
It's not gonna stop in time!

1068
01:15:54.388 --> 01:15:55.972
Stop faster!

1069
01:15:56.139 --> 01:15:58.016
He's gotta get out of there!

1070
01:15:59.184 --> 01:16:01.686
Mom, help me with this thing!

1071
01:16:10.487 --> 01:16:11.488
Oh!

1072
01:16:11.988 --> 01:16:12.988
Oh!

1073
01:16:13.073 --> 01:16:14.491
Run!

1074
01:16:14.783 --> 01:16:15.450
Tip!

1075
01:16:15.617 --> 01:16:16.660
Stop!

1076
01:16:16.827 --> 01:16:18.078
Tip!

1077
01:17:21.057 --> 01:17:22.058
Mom!

1078
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:54.674
Oh!

1079
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:01.598
You're alive.

1080
01:18:01.765 --> 01:18:04.100
But you scared me so bad!

1081
01:18:04.267 --> 01:18:05.769
You were scared?

1082
01:18:05.936 --> 01:18:08.021
I almost made a number three.

1083
01:18:08.188 --> 01:18:09.188
Not too hard!

1084
01:18:09.272 --> 01:18:11.775
It is still a possibility.

1085
01:20:21.112 --> 01:20:23.239
What was all that?

1086
01:20:23.406 --> 01:20:27.035
Not all Gorg-speak has humans words.

1087
01:20:27.202 --> 01:20:31.748
But, it turns out, Gorg was not here
because of my invitation...


1088
01:20:31.915 --> 01:20:34.209
though Gorg would have been happy
to attend.


1089
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:39.422
Gorg was here
because Gorg was tracking the rock.


1090
01:20:39.589 --> 01:20:41.091
What was in that thing?

1091
01:20:41.257 --> 01:20:42.384
Gorg family.

1092
01:20:42.967 --> 01:20:45.804
It is entire next generation.

1093
01:20:46.096 --> 01:20:47.430
All of them?

1094
01:20:47.972 --> 01:20:49.432
All of them.

1095
01:20:59.901 --> 01:21:02.070
No wonder they've been chasing you.

1096
01:21:02.779 --> 01:21:05.281
Not "they," "he."

1097
01:21:05.448 --> 01:21:09.285
Apparently, that Gorg is last Gorg.

1098
01:21:09.452 --> 01:21:11.454
That is why rock was so important.

1099
01:21:11.621 --> 01:21:13.623
Without it, he was alonely...

1100
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:16.209
and would someday be extinctly...

1101
01:21:16.376 --> 01:21:19.421
which made Gorg cranky and irrational...

1102
01:21:19.587 --> 01:21:21.798
and physically violent.

1103
01:21:21.965 --> 01:21:23.925
He was just like humansgirl.

1104
01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:28.972
He was sad-mad.

1105
01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:38.148
Thanking you.

1106
01:21:38.648 --> 01:21:40.984
Thanking you!
High hand touching.


1107
01:21:41.151 --> 01:21:42.819
Yeah, give it here. 
High hand touching.

1108
01:21:42.986 --> 01:21:45.321
Up high! You are too slow.

1109
01:21:46.489 --> 01:21:49.117
High hand touching! That hurt.

1110
01:22:14.684 --> 01:22:15.685
Pigcat!

1111
01:22:17.353 --> 01:22:18.354
Hey, on!

1112
01:22:20.273 --> 01:22:21.524
Hello, friend Kyle.

1113
01:22:21.691 --> 01:22:23.610
I have that same color.

1114
01:22:23.777 --> 01:22:25.653
- Hi, Mimom.
- Hi, Oh.


1115
01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:27.113
Awesome party, Oh!

1116
01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:30.116
Parties are so much more fun
when other people show up.


1117
01:22:30.784 --> 01:22:32.452
Is it time to
pick it up a level?

1118
01:22:32.619 --> 01:22:33.619
Yes!

1119
01:22:34.537 --> 01:22:36.164
This is gonna be sweet!

1120
01:22:36.331 --> 01:22:38.333
Drop it like it has a high temperature!

1121
01:22:53.389 --> 01:22:54.557
Oh, no!

1122
01:22:57.727 --> 01:22:59.562
What is happening to my body?

1123
01:23:04.901 --> 01:23:06.903
Shake your Boov thang!

1124

like I just do not care!
