1
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.954
What a throw.

2
00:00:57.043 --> 00:00:59.081
Hold your phone, she's got a cannon.

3
00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:00.758
Yes.

4
00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:04.924
- Come on, Kate.
- You're the only man out there. Give it to 'em.


5
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:10.090
Germans have a two-one advantage.
Great catch. La Fleur's back in the game.


6
00:01:10.176 --> 00:01:14.571
How about that? A two-on-one switcheroo.
Now Joe's has the upper hand.


7
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.539
- Great deflection.
- Take it to him.


8
00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:21.178
- He's ball-less now.
- He doesn't have any balls, Cotton.


9
00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:24.068
Winner. Average Joe's.

10
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:27.822
My sweet dick, it's magic.

11
00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:29.143
Hey, all right.

12
00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:34.678
My. The Germans losing in the first round
and Average Joe's wins in a shocking upset.


13
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.402
I feel shocked.

14
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.729
Losers.

15
00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:01.425
You must be Daddy.

16
00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:05.944
Average Joe's has shocked the dodgeball
pundits and made it to tomorrow's round


17
00:02:06.032 --> 00:02:09.584
where we'll separate the wheat from the chaff,
the men from the boys,


18
00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:12.715
and the awkwardly feminine
from the possibly Canadian.


19
00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:15.918
Don't go anywhere, folks.
It's just getting exciting.


20
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:23.639
- What the hell.
- That guy's a dickhead.


21
00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:31.525
You wanted to see me, Patches?

22
00:02:32.738 --> 00:02:36.291
You did good out there, real good.
You're a natural leader, La Fleur.


23
00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:39.377
Those men and that muff-diver believe in you.

24
00:02:39.465 --> 00:02:41.856
Kate's not a muff-diver.

25
00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.582
Hey. That's for you.

26
00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:50.033
- I can't accept this.
- You're a hell of a player, Peter.


27
00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:52.427
You earned it.

28
00:02:52.518 --> 00:02:57.233
I've got some hookers in my room.
What do you say we go celebrate? My treat.


29
00:02:57.323 --> 00:03:00.443
No, thanks, I'll just stick
with the scarf, but thank you.


30
00:03:00.526 --> 00:03:02.519
Suit yourself, queer.

31
00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:14.132
- Sorry.
- Justin?


32
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.816
Amber.
Jeez Louise, what are you doing here?


33
00:03:16.902 --> 00:03:21.856
- The National Cheerleading Championships.
- Oh, yeah, the NCCs. That's so awesome.


34
00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:25.705
- We're in the finals tomorrow. And you?
- I'm in the dodgeball tournament.


35
00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:30.347
These are my team-mates,
Dwight, Ms Veatch and Gordon.


36
00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:32.633
This is Amber.

37
00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:34.790
Come on, I wanna ride the roller coaster.

38
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.595
- Hey, Derek. Sweet 'do, man.
- Get bent, helmet. Let's go, Amber.


39
00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:45.084
- It was nice to see you. Good luck tomorrow.
- And also you. You look healthy... good.


40
00:03:45.932 --> 00:03:47.412
What?

41
00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:50.374
Don't worry about that guy, Justin.
He's a total jerk.


42
00:03:50.456 --> 00:03:53.769
He'll probably fall off the roller coaster
and break every bone.


43
00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.422
- Nice, Dwight.
- I'm just saying, it happens.


44
00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.973
My cousin Ray
-Ray. Boop. Dead.

45
00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:00.215
Thanks, man.

46
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.471
Let's huddle up here.
We've got some work to do.


47
00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:09.671
We got lucky in the first round.

48
00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:13.229
We caught those dirty Krauts napping,
but that won't happen again,


49
00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.316
so blow out the horse hockey
and remember what I taught you.


50
00:04:17.403 --> 00:04:23.598
Blockers in the centre, funnelling, aim low
and will someone catch a goddamned ball?


51
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:28.210
It's like watching a bunch of retards
trying to fuck a doorknob out there.


52
00:04:28.294 --> 00:04:32.086
Get it together.
Let's play some dodgeball.


53
00:04:32.178 --> 00:04:34.011
Hands in.

54
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.093
One, two, three, Joe's.

55
00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:39.855
- Average Joe's ready?
- Yes.


56
00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.018
Lumberjacks, ready?

57
00:04:42.108 --> 00:04:43.098
Dodgeball.

58
00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.628
Average Joe's has a tough job,
facing the Lumberjacks.


59
00:04:46.712 --> 00:04:50.152
These woodsmen probably haven't
even smelt a woman in eight months.


60
00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:52.958
They must masturbate a lot, Cotton.

61
00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.635
- Clean hit. You're out.
- In the deer gut.


62
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:58.602
- Average Joe's looking tough.
- Yes.


63
00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.012
There's a souvenir for a lucky fan.

64
00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:12.808
Timber. Peter La Fleur nails him.
That's all she wrote, folks.


65
00:05:12.898 --> 00:05:16.976
Average Joe's does some clear-cutting of
their own and moves onto the quarterfinal.


66
00:05:19.025 --> 00:05:21.746
Globo Gym hoping to drop an A-bomb
on the Kamikazes.


67
00:05:21.827 --> 00:05:25.267
I don't know how they can play
in diapers, Cotton. I never could.


68
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:26.671
Peekaboo.

69
00:05:26.912 --> 00:05:29.827
White Goodman, employing
his patented peekaboo-style attack,


70
00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:33.229
tells Suzuki Toyota Oshinawa this is my dojo.

71
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.875
Is he gonna feel it tomorrow?
Right in his beak.


72
00:05:37.964 --> 00:05:42.723
A relentless Globo Gym attack led by
their Lilliputian leader, White Goodman.


73
00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:45.769
It's gotta be the hair. 
It's beautiful.

74
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:50.134
Feathered and lethal.
You just don't see it nowadays.


75
00:05:51.297 --> 00:05:57.060
Globo Gym says, <i>"Domo arigato,</i> Mr Roboto",
and breezes into the semifinals.


76
00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.743
Skillz That Killz, ready?
Average Joe's, ready? Dodgeball.


77
00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:06.108
Average Joe's planning
to playa hate Skillz That Killz,


78
00:06:06.192 --> 00:06:08.503
the inner-city champs for five years straight.

79
00:06:08.594 --> 00:06:13.115
Skillz might be looking past Average Joe's,
doing more dancing than dodgeballing.


80
00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.638
They better check themselves
before they wreck themselves.


81
00:06:16.722 --> 00:06:21.721
Right you are, partner.
Great catch. La Fleur wheels and fires.


82
00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:25.125
Winner. Average Joe's.

83
00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:29.926
And Average Joe's, not blinded by the
bling-bling, advances to the semifinal.


84
00:06:32.338 --> 00:06:36.779
Globo Gym's making mincemeat
of the Las Vegas Police Department.


85
00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:38.536
That's gotta hurt.

86
00:06:40.586 --> 00:06:42.419
B-b-b-bull's-eye.

87
00:06:42.508 --> 00:06:44.740
Winner. Globo Gym.

88
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.704
Sportsmanship be darned.
Globo Gym hands the Las Vegas Police a 187,


89
00:06:49.795 --> 00:06:52.266
and they're going to the finals.

90
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.802
The Poughkeepsie State Flying Cougars
are all over Average Joe's today.


91
00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:04.044
Itjust doesn't look good for 'em. The winner
of this match faces Globo Gym in the finals.


92
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.123
Right in the testicles.

93
00:07:06.212 --> 00:07:08.648
Ouch
-Town. Population: You, bro.

94
00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:11.774
Average Joe's down to their final two players.

95
00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:15.171
La Fleur can't hold on.
He's gotta sit down.


96
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:18.142
- Time out. Gordy.
- Time out. Time out.


97
00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:20.099
Time. Time is out.

98
00:07:20.186 --> 00:07:24.024
It looks like the clock is about to
strike midnight on this Cinderella story,


99
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.706
turning Average Joe's
into the proverbial pumpkin.


100
00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:29.184
I sure do like pumpkins, Cotton.

101
00:07:30.556 --> 00:07:33.950
You won't hit 'em. They're too good,
and you suck somethin' awful.


102
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.558
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Our only shot is for you to get angry.


103
00:07:37.643 --> 00:07:41.196
- Roger that. OK.
- All right. Hands in.


104
00:07:41.287 --> 00:07:43.598
- One, two, three.
- Joe's.


105
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.371
You gotta get angry. 
Get angry now.

106
00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:52.009
Gordon Pibb, alone, facing five Cougars.
It's all over but the crying.


107
00:07:52.098 --> 00:07:55.491
Sayonara, <i>auf Wiedersehen</i> and goodbye.

108
00:08:08.234 --> 00:08:11.547
- Dodgeball.
- Let the dodgeball slaughter begin.


109
00:08:11.637 --> 00:08:13.470
Good deflection there.

110
00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:15.711
Hang on. And another one.

111
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:18.272
Three balls at once. Who knew?

112
00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:21.201
Four on one.
Pibb won't go down without a fight.


113
00:08:21.287 --> 00:08:23.598
That's it.

114
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:26.684
- You're kidding me.
- He's callin' 'em out.


115
00:08:27.493 --> 00:08:29.486
Now it's two on one. 
Who'd have thunk it?

116
00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:34.290
- Go, you crazy son of a bitch. Go.
- He's on the warpath.


117
00:08:36.342 --> 00:08:38.858
Incredible. It's one on one.

118
00:08:38.945 --> 00:08:42.623
- I can't believe it.
- It's just not believable, Cotton.


119
00:08:50.476 --> 00:08:51.466
Winner.

120
00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:54.872
Average Joe's wins.

121
00:08:54.961 --> 00:08:59.834
They are going to the finals
to play Globo Gym for $50,000.


122
00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:03.638
- That'll buy one heck of a pumpkin.
- Right you are, Pep.


123
00:09:03.729 --> 00:09:06.121
I never would have dreamed it possible.

124
00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:10.653
But with seven-time ADAA All-Star
Patches O'Houlihan at the helm,


125
00:09:10.736 --> 00:09:13.458
I guess it must be
the luck of the Irish.

126
00:09:17.343 --> 00:09:21.260
Tomorrow we're gonna pecker-slap
those Globo Gym bastards.


127
00:09:21.347 --> 00:09:22.098
Yeah.

128
00:09:22.188 --> 00:09:26.549
- You really think we can beat Globo Gym?
- As long as we got Patches, we got a shot.


129
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:34.474
My God.

130
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:39.199
Well, it's probably the way
he would have wanted to go.


131
00:09:39.285 --> 00:09:42.564
- What?
- What are we gonna do without Patches?


132
00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:44.720
We're gonna get our taints handed to us.

133
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.771
- What's a taint?
- I dunno. Sounds bad.


134
00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:52.089
Maybe you should
go say something to the guys.


135
00:09:52.178 --> 00:09:53.294
Yeah.

136
00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:59.733
They don't make a "sorry your coach just got
crushed by two tons of irony" Hallmark card.


137
00:10:01.227 --> 00:10:03.697
I'll be right back.

138
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.440
What?

139
00:10:15.521 --> 00:10:20.520
We're opening a new Globo Gym in Mexico
City. I've been boning up on my Spanish.


140
00:10:22.608 --> 00:10:25.922
Me'Shell was having some digestive
problems. I hope you don't mind.


141
00:10:26.012 --> 00:10:28.209
Will you shut that?

142
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:30.856
For all of us, baby.

143
00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:39.022
So that's the deal. I give you $100,000,
you sign over the deed to your gym.


144
00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:40.778
Period.

145
00:10:40.866 --> 00:10:42.939
End o'story.

146
00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:48.154
You really think you can come here and buy
me out, you're a lot dumber than I thought.


147
00:10:48.234 --> 00:10:53.632
Oh, I don't think I'm a lot dumber than you
thought I'd think that I thought I was once.


148
00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:56.794
Look, Peter, I know what it's like.

149
00:10:56.882 --> 00:11:01.324
Really. For all our blustery back-and-forth,
we're really pretty much the same guy.


150
00:11:01.407 --> 00:11:04.960
We're both leaders. And I like
what you've done with the gym over there.


151
00:11:05.051 --> 00:11:09.765
I love the whole "I'm not OK, you're not OK,
but that's OK" thing you got going.


152
00:11:09.855 --> 00:11:13.056
"You can be fat as long as
you're happy inside." It works.


153
00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:16.452
And they love you. 
Whoo, do they love you.

154
00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:18.455
You're their Fonzie, Pete.

155
00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:20.741
"Hey." Right?

156
00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:28.112
But do you really think it's fair for them
to put all that pressure on you? All the time?


157
00:11:29.035 --> 00:11:32.235
Looking to you to solve their every problem?

158
00:11:32.318 --> 00:11:33.877
I mean, come on.

159
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.957
I know you. You know you.

160
00:11:38.044 --> 00:11:40.959
And I know you
know that I know you.

161
00:11:41.047 --> 00:11:43.438
You're heading for a fall, Pete.

162
00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:46.888
Sooner or later, 
Average Joe's is gonna close.

163
00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:50.970
And when it does, they're gonna blame you.

164
00:11:52.498 --> 00:11:56.336
I don't know if you've ever seen $100,000,
except maybe in the movies.


165
00:11:56.422 --> 00:12:00.180
But I assure you,
something gets lost in the translation.


166
00:12:03.069 --> 00:12:07.032
Money. $100,000. 
Dodgeball game.

167
00:12:08.754 --> 00:12:10.508
Take the money.

168
00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:15.877
Invest it in something.
Give it to charity, I don't care.


169
00:12:22.488 --> 00:12:24.560
Just sign the contract.

170
00:12:29.775 --> 00:12:32.656
Come on, guys. We got Peter.

171
00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:36.735
And they got guys named Laser and Blazer
and Taser, and all kinds of asers.


172
00:12:36.822 --> 00:12:40.216
Gar. Steve's gotta go drain the sea monster.

173
00:12:41.307 --> 00:12:43.379
Here. Justin, your virgin daiquiri.

174
00:12:43.469 --> 00:12:45.940
- Thanks, Ms Veatch.
- Nothing for me.


175
00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:50.109
- Dwight says we'll get killed out there, Peter.
- Let's not talk about tomorrow.


176
00:12:50.196 --> 00:12:53.555
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. It's a little complicated.


177
00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:56.679
- But what do you think we should do?
- Yeah. Come on, tell us.


178
00:12:56.762 --> 00:12:57.958
What's the plan?

179
00:12:58.044 --> 00:13:01.164
What do you guys want from me?
I don't have a plan for you.


180
00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:05.290
We're gonna play Globo Gym tomorrow
and we're probably gonna lose.


181
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:10.814
It's the truth. The sooner you guys get that
through your head, the easier this will all be.


182
00:13:12.178 --> 00:13:14.648
Jesus Christ.

183
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:17.173
He didn't mean that.

184
00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:21.340
- Is he being serious?
- He's probably just stressed out.


185
00:13:21.427 --> 00:13:24.183
I've never seen him like that.

186
00:13:26.192 --> 00:13:29.870
Gar, matey, where are you headed? Peter...

187
00:13:29.956 --> 00:13:32.426
You are not a pirate.

188
00:13:39.805 --> 00:13:44.281
OK, guys. Let's get out of here
and get some rest for tomorrow, right?


189
00:13:51.617 --> 00:13:53.416
Dwight...

190
00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:58.339
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
I'm gonna have a bathroom... go to the drink...


191
00:13:58.424 --> 00:14:00.144
in the bathroom.

192
00:14:00.226 --> 00:14:02.742
Whatever you do, wash your hands.

193
00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:15.281
Excuse me, miss. 
I was wondering if...

194
00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:17.797
You are the one who stares at me.

195
00:14:17.883 --> 00:14:20.161
Why is this?

196
00:14:20.246 --> 00:14:24.687
Because I think you're
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.


197
00:14:30.816 --> 00:14:33.128
Watch it, freak.

198
00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:47.662
Go back to Treasure Island.

199
00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:50.111
Fag.

200
00:14:50.196 --> 00:14:52.189
Screw you.

201
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.722
Katie, bar the door.
It's time for the championship match


202
00:15:07.813 --> 00:15:10.125
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".

203
00:15:10.216 --> 00:15:14.099
We've seen it all here, folks.
Grit, determination, incontinence.


204
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.650
And it's all come down to this -
a Cinderella story.


205
00:15:16.742 --> 00:15:21.343
Average Joe's Gymnasium hopes to
drive their vorpal blade snicker-snack


206
00:15:21.427 --> 00:15:25.310
into the heart of the dodgeball Jabberwocky
that is the Globo Gym Purple Cobras,


207
00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:29.070
and walk away with $50,000
in stone-cold cash.


208
00:15:29.155 --> 00:15:33.118
Hello, everybody, and welcome
to what you've all been waiting for.


209
00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:36.877
A David-and-Goliath story
truer than the Bible itself.


210
00:15:36.963 --> 00:15:40.926
The championship dodgeball match
here on ESPN8 - the "Ocho".


211
00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:45.169
Peter?

212
00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:48.973
Peter?

213
00:15:49.055 --> 00:15:51.525
Hello?

214
00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:52.892
Peter?

215
00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:55.700
Come on, everybody headed down...

216
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.663
So what happens on a double fault?

217
00:16:06.752 --> 00:16:11.911
On a double fault you go to sudden-death
elimination. It's Continuation Rule 113-D.


218
00:16:11.998 --> 00:16:14.639
- Whatever.
- Hey, guys, wait up.


219
00:16:18.484 --> 00:16:19.838
Justin.

220
00:16:19.926 --> 00:16:23.923
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- Really? I mean, why? What's up?


221
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:28.007
Derek fell off the roller coaster
and broke every bone in his body.


222
00:16:28.094 --> 00:16:29.494
My God, that's awful.

223
00:16:29.575 --> 00:16:33.015
We were the centre Kewpie. With no
centre Kewpie we can't do our routine.


224
00:16:33.099 --> 00:16:36.014
- No. I'm sorry.
- You gotta do it.


225
00:16:36.102 --> 00:16:37.695
What?

226
00:16:37.783 --> 00:16:39.776
No, no, no, no, no. I can't.

227
00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:43.578
Please. You are the only one in Las Vegas
who knows our routine.


228
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:49.033
- The dodgeball championship's at noon.
- You'll be back in time. I promise.


229
00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.551
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes.


230
00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:55.677
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No. No time.


231
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:57.355
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No time.


232
00:16:59.165 --> 00:17:03.960
Average Joe's are a 50-1 underdog here today.
No one is giving them much of a chance.


233
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.803
What do you think, Pep?

234
00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.964
I spoke to White Goodman before the match

235
00:17:08.054 --> 00:17:12.974
and he told me that his team
really wants to win this one.


236
00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:16.338
Right. And the stage is set for
Darwin's cruellest play to unfold.


237
00:17:16.422 --> 00:17:20.055
So don't go anywhere, folks.
The Schadenfreude is about to begin.


238
00:17:20.146 --> 00:17:24.302
- I don't understand. Why would Peter leave?
- He knows we're gonna get killed.


239
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:29.469
Hey. That's not true. I don't know why Peter
left, but we can do this without him.


240
00:17:29.555 --> 00:17:32.630
We just have to figure it out.
Owen, you'll have to play.


241
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.998
- OK, yeah.
- Great. But we'll still be two players short.


242
00:17:36.082 --> 00:17:40.045
We're still missing the teenage love-puppy
and Steve the Pirate.


243
00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:42.483
Who's Steve the Pirate?

244
00:17:42.568 --> 00:17:46.281
The only guy on our team
who dresses like a pirate.


245
00:17:46.372 --> 00:17:50.369
Wait. There's a guy on our team
dressed like a pirate?


246
00:17:51.897 --> 00:17:59.334
And now, let's hear it for the West Davenport
High School Charging Donkeys.


247
00:17:59.425 --> 00:18:01.418
Donkeys.

248
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:26.610
Go, Donkeys.

249
00:18:29.335 --> 00:18:32.250
- We did it.
- Holy cow. My God.


250
00:18:32.338 --> 00:18:35.572
- It was perfect. You were perfect.
- God, I gotta go.


251
00:18:35.661 --> 00:18:37.858
Wait. Aren't you gonna stay for the trophy?

252
00:18:37.944 --> 00:18:40.619
I'm sorry, Amber. 
I got my own trophy to win.

253
00:18:56.682 --> 00:18:59.074
Now I'm going.

254
00:19:03.889 --> 00:19:08.445
Here come the Purple Cobras,
led by White Goodman. All business.


255
00:19:08.534 --> 00:19:11.974
We haven't seen Average Joe's yet.
They haven't made it to the court.


256
00:19:12.058 --> 00:19:15.451
It could be a psychological ploy,
or something worse.


257
00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:19.777
They're definitely not on the court, Cotton.
Their absence is noticeable.


258
00:19:19.865 --> 00:19:24.466
We'll be right back
after these words from our sponsors...


259
00:19:26.072 --> 00:19:28.304
Can I get a bottle of water?

260
00:19:30.716 --> 00:19:32.949
Aren't you Peter La Fleur?

261
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.558
- Lance Armstrong?
- Yeah, that's me. But I'm a big fan of yours.


262
00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:41.356
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been watching the dodgeball.


263
00:19:41.447 --> 00:19:46.242
I just can't get enough of it. I'm really pullin'
for you against those jerks from Globo Gym.


264
00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:50.132
I think you better hurry up
or you're gonna be late.


265
00:19:50.216 --> 00:19:54.532
- Actually, I decided to quit, Lance.
- Quit?


266
00:19:55.341 --> 00:20:01.217
Once I thought of quittin', when I had brain,
lung and testicular cancer at the same time.


267
00:20:01.907 --> 00:20:04.583
But with the support of my friends
I got back on the bike


268
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.267
and I won the Tour de France
five times in a row.


269
00:20:07.353 --> 00:20:11.236
But I'm sure you have
a good reason to quit.

270
00:20:11.317 --> 00:20:14.710
What are you dying from
that's keepin' you from the finals?


271
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.843
Right now, it feels
a little bit like shame.

272
00:20:18.925 --> 00:20:24.527
If people never quit when the going got tough
they'd have nothing to regret all their lives.


273
00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:29.405
Good luck to you, Peter. I'm sure
this decision won't haunt you forever.


274
00:20:35.621 --> 00:20:39.538
Steve? Steve the Pirate? "Scurvy."

275
00:20:39.625 --> 00:20:43.668
- No. Not ringing any bells.
- Forget it, man.


276
00:20:43.749 --> 00:20:47.871
We'll play with four people. It's not
an advantage. Can't you bend the rules?


277
00:20:47.954 --> 00:20:52.156
There's nothing I can do. Rules are rules.
You don't have enough players.


278
00:20:52.238 --> 00:20:56.121
Inform the committee and Mr Goodman
about Average Joe's forfeit.


279
00:20:56.202 --> 00:20:59.356
- Yes, sir.
- Better luck next year.


280
00:21:00.967 --> 00:21:02.481
Excuse me.

281
00:21:02.568 --> 00:21:05.881
Sorry I'm late. You won't believe
whatjust happened. Hey, guys.


282
00:21:05.972 --> 00:21:08.647
You're just in time to help us forfeit.

283
00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:10.727
Forfeit? Why?

284
00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:15.613
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, but...

285
00:21:15.701 --> 00:21:19.584
Yes, I'm being told that Average Joe's
does not have enough players


286
00:21:19.665 --> 00:21:22.501
and will be forfeiting
the championship match.


287
00:21:22.588 --> 00:21:25.549
It's a bold strategy, Cotton.
Let's see if it pays off for 'em.


288
00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:31.109
To the tournament floor we go, for the sceptre
presentation from the Dodgeball Chancellor.


289
00:21:31.197 --> 00:21:34.829
Ladies and gentlemen,
by the power vested in me


290
00:21:34.921 --> 00:21:39.954
by our governing body, the American
Dodgeball Association of America,


291
00:21:40.046 --> 00:21:44.566
and in concurrence with our sponsors,
Lumber Liquidators and Omaha Steaks,


292
00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.722
it gives me great pleasure

293
00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:51.527
to declare the winner of this year's
Las Vegas International Tournament to be...


294
00:21:51.617 --> 00:21:53.769
Wait. He's here.

295
00:21:58.064 --> 00:22:00.739
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

296
00:22:00.826 --> 00:22:02.864
We're ready to play, Your Honour.

297
00:22:02.949 --> 00:22:07.708
Too late. Your lovable band of losers already
forfeited. The trophy and money are mine.


298
00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:11.153
He's right. The team already forfeited.
There's nothing you can do.


299
00:22:11.237 --> 00:22:13.799
Facial, La Fleur. Total facial.

300
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:16.719
Actually, that's not true.

301
00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:20.925
The committee can overrule the chancellor -
that's you, sir - by a two-thirds vote.


302
00:22:21.007 --> 00:22:23.239
He's right. He's right. It's a bylaw.

303
00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:27.847
- It's a bylaw.
- What's a bylaw?


304
00:22:28.814 --> 00:22:32.254
- Hang on a second here, folks.
- Let them play.


305
00:22:32.338 --> 00:22:36.096
We mightjust have a championship game yet.

306
00:22:36.182 --> 00:22:39.143
Listen to this crowd.

307
00:22:39.225 --> 00:22:41.343
Unbelievable.

308
00:22:41.427 --> 00:22:46.552
Pepper, it's clear what the crowd wants, but
the committee members have the final say.


309
00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:49.752
And it looks like
they've come to a decision.

310
00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:52.511
Joe's needs two "yes" votes to play.

311
00:22:52.598 --> 00:22:55.877
- There's a thumbs-up. Good news for Joe's.
- Please.


312
00:22:55.962 --> 00:22:59.037
- Let's see how our second judge votes.
- Thank you.


313
00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:06.004
Oh, tough sledding there. It's all even. Their
fate hangs on the thumb of our final judge.


314
00:23:06.092 --> 00:23:09.451
Thumbs up. Average Joe's can play.

315
00:23:09.535 --> 00:23:12.689
That is pure poppycock.
You're gonna let them do that?


316
00:23:12.778 --> 00:23:16.138
- Thank you, Chuck Norris.
- Thank you, Peter.


317
00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:21.382
All right, captains. Shake hands,
and let's have a clean match.


318
00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:23.460
Good luck, White.

319
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.986
Cram it up your cramhole, La Fleur.

320
00:23:28.074 --> 00:23:31.387
Prepare to be humiliated on cable television.

321
00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:33.470
Whatever.

322
00:23:35.361 --> 00:23:38.436
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah, I thought so too.


323
00:23:38.524 --> 00:23:41.325
What? I got a plan.

324
00:23:43.169 --> 00:23:48.966
Let's play smart. Wait for two-on-ones. Cover
closely for your pick-ups. What's our motto?


325
00:23:49.055 --> 00:23:51.173
- "Aim low".
- That's right.


326
00:23:51.257 --> 00:23:54.138
All I'm asking is that
you give it your best for Patches.


327
00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:58.342
I say we go out there, let it all hang loose,
try to have some fun.


328
00:23:58.424 --> 00:24:00.987
I mean, it's only dodgeball, right?

329
00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:04.950
- Put 'em in. One, two, three.
- Joe's.


330
00:24:27.653 --> 00:24:29.850
Globo Gym, ready?

331
00:24:29.936 --> 00:24:32.736
Average Joe's, ready?

332
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:35.896
Dodgeball.

333
00:24:35.982 --> 00:24:41.220
Championship match is under way.
Average Joe's versus the Globo Gym Goliath.


334
00:24:42.468 --> 00:24:45.110
Quick elimination there for Kate Veatch.

335
00:24:46.392 --> 00:24:49.512
White Goodman's hit,
but that ball's up for grabs. And...


336
00:24:49.595 --> 00:24:51.474
- It's caught.
- That's a catch.


337
00:24:51.557 --> 00:24:54.997
- You're out, La Fleur.
- Peter La Fleur has gotta sit down.


338
00:24:55.081 --> 00:24:58.201
And Joe's has lost
their two best players early.


339
00:24:58.564 --> 00:25:00.636
Dwight Baumgarten still playing hard.

340
00:25:00.726 --> 00:25:03.289
Hits Me'Shell Jones right on the dome.

341
00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:05.282
You're mine next time.

342
00:25:08.494 --> 00:25:13.289
Right in the tokus.

343
00:25:17.183 --> 00:25:19.540
- Hi.
- Hey.


344
00:25:21.347 --> 00:25:24.023
- You're out.
- I don't know what that was,


345
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:28.710
but it leaves Joe's on the wrong side
of a 4-2 advantage.


346
00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:31.709
Joe's gets an elimination. 
It's two on three.

347
00:25:31.797 --> 00:25:33.357
Get out.

348
00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:35.716
Gordo. Lose your temper. Get mad.

349
00:25:37.603 --> 00:25:41.600
White Goodman with a catch. Gordon Pibb
goes out, Me'Shell Jones comes back in.


350
00:25:41.687 --> 00:25:43.407
You're out, four-eyes.

351
00:25:43.489 --> 00:25:47.771
Well, it's all up to Average Joe's youngest
member. He's gotta make a play here, Pepper.


352
00:25:47.853 --> 00:25:49.493
Word, Cotton.

353
00:25:49.575 --> 00:25:54.734
Four Cobras and one Joe. Even a rabid
mongoose wouldn't have a chance now.


354
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.462
- Nice dodge.
- Stay alive. Stay alive.


355
00:25:59.465 --> 00:26:01.776
They're just toying with the young man now.

356
00:26:01.867 --> 00:26:04.703
He's gotta avoid getting hit. 
That's the key.

357
00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.544
Justin, let's go.

358
00:26:07.713 --> 00:26:09.194
What a great catch.

359
00:26:09.275 --> 00:26:12.509
And another.
Peter La Fleur comes back into the game.


360
00:26:12.598 --> 00:26:16.481
Just like that, a three-player swing.
Joe's isn't done yet.


361
00:26:16.562 --> 00:26:18.122
Justin.

362
00:26:18.204 --> 00:26:20.674
I love you.

363
00:26:20.766 --> 00:26:22.599
I love you t...

364
00:26:23.289 --> 00:26:25.247
Joanie loves Chachi.

365
00:26:25.331 --> 00:26:28.930
Two players left on each side.
What a match. What a sport.


366
00:26:29.535 --> 00:26:35.013
Throw out the rule book, folks,
it's down and dirty now. Street dodgeball.


367
00:26:36.662 --> 00:26:40.341
Look out. La Fleur goes down -
he's a sitting duck.


368
00:26:45.231 --> 00:26:51.153
How about that, folks? Kate Veatch takes the
bullet for Peter La Fleur. Now that's sacrifice.


369
00:26:51.237 --> 00:26:55.997
As touching a moment as we've seen
on the dodgeball court all tournament.


370
00:26:56.762 --> 00:26:59.325
A blatant cheap shot from White Goodman.

371
00:26:59.405 --> 00:27:03.926
- That's court misconduct. That's a warning.
- Come on. Gimme a break.


372
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:06.491
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


373
00:27:06.572 --> 00:27:08.964
- Jesus. Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm all right.


374
00:27:09.055 --> 00:27:12.095
- It was an accident. I thought she was in play.
- Not a chance.


375
00:27:12.178 --> 00:27:15.093
We're sweating like greased monkeys.
I can't hold on to a ball.


376
00:27:15.181 --> 00:27:18.301
Sorry, miss, but you're out.
You gotta get off the court.


377
00:27:18.384 --> 00:27:20.104
Watch him, man.

378
00:27:20.186 --> 00:27:22.418
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?


379
00:27:22.508 --> 00:27:24.228
Kick his ass.

380
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.830
- Here's the restart.
- Players, to your positions.


381
00:27:27.913 --> 00:27:32.230
Looks like it's gonna be a two-on-one,
a <i>ménage à trois</i> of pain.


382
00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:35.916
Usually you pay double
for that kind of action, Cotton.


383
00:27:37.803 --> 00:27:41.402
You're playing ready dodgeball.
Balls are at your feet.


384
00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:43.719
Ready? Dodgeball.

385
00:27:43.809 --> 00:27:48.729
It's a cat-and-mouse game, folks.
Peter La Fleur has gotta wait for his shot.


386
00:27:52.058 --> 00:27:54.494
He gets the elimination.

387
00:27:55.661 --> 00:28:01.185
My. Globo Gym wins.
A Cinderella story cast asunder.


388
00:28:01.267 --> 00:28:05.230
Average Joe's has come all this way
for nothing. Absolutely nothing.


389
00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:07.953
They're not gonna get anything, Cotton.

390
00:28:09.075 --> 00:28:13.038
No elimination. Double fault.
You stepped over the line on the throw.


391
00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:17.002
What? You gotta be out of your mind.
That is the worst call I've ever seen.


392
00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:21.285
I'm out here busting my butt and you come in
with a bush-league call like that? Bullcrap.


393
00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:26.207
ADAA Continuation Rule 113-D, sir.
Sudden death.


394
00:28:26.292 --> 00:28:27.692
All right. Bring it.

395
00:28:27.773 --> 00:28:31.087
I don't believe it, folks. Sudden death.

396
00:28:31.177 --> 00:28:32.850
Well, let me tell you,

397
00:28:32.939 --> 00:28:38.541
a double-fault final-play elimination hasn't
occurred since the Helsinki episode of 1919,


398
00:28:38.624 --> 00:28:41.266
and I think we all remember
how that turned out.


399
00:28:41.347 --> 00:28:47.747
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the greatest
happening in sport. Sudden-death dodgeball.


400
00:28:47.833 --> 00:28:50.145
Pepper needs new shorts.

401
00:28:52.078 --> 00:28:55.198
White, Peter, this is sudden death.

402
00:28:55.641 --> 00:29:01.005
Only striking an opposing player eliminates
them. Catching the ball does nothing.


403
00:29:01.087 --> 00:29:04.925
Both feet must remain
in the triangle at all times.


404
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:09.531
You may throw any time after my call.
Understood?


405
00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:14.095
OK. Let's have a clean match.
Good luck, gentlemen.


406
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.381
This is it, La Loser.

407
00:29:18.784 --> 00:29:22.337
You ready for the hurricane?

408
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:26.988
Just don't go cryin' to mama when
I spank you in front of all these people.


409
00:29:28.114 --> 00:29:32.954
You don't go crying to your daddy
after I wipe it up with your face.


410
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.321
- White?
- Yeah?


411
00:29:37.403 --> 00:29:41.844
- You look awful fat in those pants.
- Players, to your positions.


412
00:29:41.928 --> 00:29:45.560
This is about gamesmanship.
Throw early and you're defenceless.


413
00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:51.493
Throw late and you're eliminated.
Dilemma, thy name is dodgeball.


414
00:29:51.577 --> 00:29:54.572
This sport doesn't build character,
it reveals it.


415
00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.621
Effin' A, Cotton. Effin' A.

416
00:29:59.385 --> 00:30:01.378
Come on, talk to me.

417
00:30:02.908 --> 00:30:05.061
Listen up, crotch stain.

418
00:30:05.151 --> 00:30:09.353
Remember your training
and trust your instincts.


419
00:30:09.435 --> 00:30:12.111
You can do it. 
I believe in you.

420
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:16.640
Bye-bye.

421
00:30:16.722 --> 00:30:17.712
Right.

422
00:30:17.803 --> 00:30:20.604
Players, turn and step in.

423
00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:38.212
What the hell's he doing?

424
00:30:38.304 --> 00:30:40.820
I don't know.

425
00:30:42.868 --> 00:30:44.064
Get a load of this guy.

426
00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.782
In 23 years of broadcasting
I thought I'd seen it all, folks.


427
00:30:47.873 --> 00:30:51.631
But it looks like Peter La Fleur
has actually blindfolded himself.


428
00:30:51.717 --> 00:30:54.393
He will not be able
to see very well, Cotton.

429
00:31:03.569 --> 00:31:06.040
Ready?

430
00:31:10.656 --> 00:31:13.014
Dodgeball.

431
00:31:18.784 --> 00:31:20.982
Goodbye, Peter.

432
00:31:21.067 --> 00:31:23.788
I always knew you were weak.

433
00:31:27.153 --> 00:31:29.828
Air Goodman, comin' at ya.

434
00:31:37.363 --> 00:31:40.358
Down goes Goodman.
Down goes Goodman.


435
00:31:40.446 --> 00:31:43.646
Winner. Average Joe's.

436
00:31:46.973 --> 00:31:50.525
Do you believe in unlikelihoods?

437
00:31:50.616 --> 00:31:53.736
Average Joe's shocking the dodgeball world

438
00:31:53.819 --> 00:31:57.862
and upsetting Globo Gym
in the championship match.


439
00:31:57.944 --> 00:31:59.264
Unbelievable.

440
00:31:59.345 --> 00:32:03.627
I have been to the Great Wall of China.
I have seen the Pyramids of Egypt.


441
00:32:03.709 --> 00:32:06.226
I've even witnessed a grown man
satisfy a camel.


442
00:32:06.312 --> 00:32:08.544
But never in all
my years as a sportscaster

443
00:32:08.634 --> 00:32:13.588
have I witnessed something as improbable,
as impossible, as what we've witnessed here.


444
00:32:13.679 --> 00:32:18.280
The little team that could, Average Joe's
Gymnasium, underdogs throughout,


445
00:32:18.364 --> 00:32:23.045
stand before us, aglow,
as true dodgeball champions.


446
00:32:23.129 --> 00:32:27.604
On behalf of the American Dodgeball
Association of America,


447
00:32:27.693 --> 00:32:32.010
it is my honour to present to you
this cheque for $50,000.


448
00:32:38.024 --> 00:32:40.985
What are you so happy about, La Fleur?
None of this matters.


449
00:32:41.067 --> 00:32:45.383
You signed your gym over to me last night,
remember? You lost, I won.


450
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:47.543
Suck failure, freaks.

451
00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:50.753
Peter, is that true?

452
00:32:50.836 --> 00:32:52.749
Yeah, it's true.

453
00:32:52.838 --> 00:32:56.039
It's true I sold Average Joe's to White.

454
00:32:56.122 --> 00:32:58.479
It's true that every man has his price.

455
00:32:58.564 --> 00:33:03.359
And it's also true that money won
is a lot sweeter than money earned.


456
00:33:03.449 --> 00:33:07.651
- Now he's a philosophiser.
- Excuse us. Step aside, please.


457
00:33:08.734 --> 00:33:11.046
Your winnings, Mr La Fleur.
Congratulations.


458
00:33:11.137 --> 00:33:15.020
- Right on time. I appreciate it. Thank you.
- What is that? What winnings?


459
00:33:15.101 --> 00:33:19.576
Gosh, I totally forgot to tell you. I took the
$100,000 bribe that you gave me last night,


460
00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:22.626
and I put it on us to win.
We were going off at 50-1.


461
00:33:22.708 --> 00:33:25.988
Anyone? Top of your head?
What's 50 times $100,000?


462
00:33:26.072 --> 00:33:27.426
$50,000?

463
00:33:27.513 --> 00:33:31.430
$5 million. Peter, are you kidding me?

464
00:33:31.517 --> 00:33:33.589
Surprise.

465
00:33:36.762 --> 00:33:41.682
Stick it in your ear, La Fleur. I wouldn't sell
you your gym back for all King Midas's silver.


466
00:33:41.767 --> 00:33:46.448
The gym is mine. So you can take your band
of yellow-bellied losers and crawl out of here.


467
00:33:46.532 --> 00:33:49.368
You're right. I can't make you
sell Average Joe's to me.


468
00:33:49.455 --> 00:33:53.134
So I guess I'll just take your advice
and invest in something.


469
00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:57.296
- Say the controlling stake of Globo Gym.
- That's preposterous. I'd never allow it.


470
00:33:57.383 --> 00:34:01.016
Globo Gym is a publicly traded company.
There's nothing you can do about it.


471
00:34:01.107 --> 00:34:06.345
So I would control Globo Gym
and everything that Globo Gym owns,


472
00:34:06.432 --> 00:34:10.429
which, as of last
night, is Average Joe's Gym.

473
00:34:11.757 --> 00:34:13.158
I'm your new boss, White.

474
00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.518
You can't be my boss. Nobody can.
I'm my own boss. I created myself.


475
00:34:16.602 --> 00:34:19.677
- You're fired, pal.
- You can't do anything to me.


476
00:34:20.206 --> 00:34:23.167
You're going down, La Fleur,
like a sweet muffin.


477
00:34:23.249 --> 00:34:26.722
- Another time, another time.
- You suck, La Fleur.


478
00:34:28.534 --> 00:34:30.527
Give me that.

479
00:34:33.299 --> 00:34:35.769
Man, the blindfold was crazy.

480
00:34:37.223 --> 00:34:39.739
Peter.

481
00:34:39.825 --> 00:34:42.296
Look. It's Steve the Pirate.

482
00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:50.790
I just wanted to tell you
that I thought about what you said, and


483
00:34:51.797 --> 00:34:54.030
I guess you're right.

484
00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.397
I'm not really a pirate.

485
00:34:57.683 --> 00:35:00.154
I don't know, Steve.

486
00:35:00.246 --> 00:35:02.364
If you're not a pirate,

487
00:35:02.448 --> 00:35:06.161
who the hell am I gonna split
all that buried treasure with?


488
00:35:11.097 --> 00:35:12.895
Peter...

489
00:35:12.979 --> 00:35:14.777
Gar, Steve.

490
00:35:20.106 --> 00:35:21.699
We missed you.

491
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.184
Hey, you.

492
00:35:26.272 --> 00:35:28.265
Hey, you.

493
00:35:29.915 --> 00:35:31.873
- Joyce?
- Kate.


494
00:35:32.318 --> 00:35:36.600
- I thought you were in Guam.
- I caught an early flight. I wouldn't miss this.


495
00:35:36.682 --> 00:35:38.879
You are amazing.

496
00:35:42.408 --> 00:35:46.803
- I told you she was a lesbian.
- Wow. Good call.


497
00:35:47.293 --> 00:35:50.288
Hey. I'm not a lesbian.

498
00:35:50.376 --> 00:35:51.970
You're not?

499
00:35:52.058 --> 00:35:53.538
No.

500
00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:55.977
I'm bisexual.

501
00:35:57.543 --> 00:35:59.376
Snap.

502
00:35:59.946 --> 00:36:03.305
All right, everybody. Smile big.

503
00:36:07.994 --> 00:36:11.751
Hi. I'm Peter La Fleur,
owner and operator of Average Joe's Gym.


504
00:36:11.837 --> 00:36:15.356
I'm here to tell you
you're perfectjust the way you are.


505
00:36:15.441 --> 00:36:20.918
But if you feel like losin' a few pounds, gettin'
healthier, and makin' friends in the process,


506
00:36:21.007 --> 00:36:22.760
Joe's is the place for you.

507
00:36:22.848 --> 00:36:26.162
Don't forget that youth dodgeball classes
are forming right now.


508
00:36:26.252 --> 00:36:30.933
So come on down and learn a great game the
way it's supposed to be played. Right, kids?


509
00:36:31.017 --> 00:36:33.010
Right.

510
00:36:42.148 --> 00:36:44.186
Spare me.

511
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.661
I won that tournament.

512
00:36:49.235 --> 00:36:51.957
Fucking Chuck Norris.

513
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.953

ENGLISH

515
00:39:50.096 --> 00:39:53.136
Yeah. I hope you're all happy now.

516
00:39:53.219 --> 00:39:55.655
Good guy wins, bad guy loses.

517
00:39:55.741 --> 00:39:58.212
Big friggin' surprise.

518
00:39:59.265 --> 00:40:01.178
I love happy endings.

519
00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:08.272
You know, that's the problem
with the American cinema.


520
00:40:08.354 --> 00:40:10.745
Can't handle any complexity in it, you know?

521
00:40:10.836 --> 00:40:14.879
"Don't make me think,
I just wanna be entertained."


522
00:40:14.961 --> 00:40:16.793
All right, fine.

523
00:40:16.882 --> 00:40:20.401
You want a little somethin'-somethin'
for the ride home?


524
00:40:20.486 --> 00:40:22.877
Check these boots out for size.

525
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.768
My milkshake brings all
the boys to the yard

526
00:40:26.852 --> 00:40:28.925
And they're like, "It's better than yours"

527
00:40:29.015 --> 00:40:30.893
Damn right, it's better than yours

528
00:40:30.977 --> 00:40:33.539
I could teach you,
but I'd have to charge

529
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:38.537
What the boys go crazy for

530
00:40:39.825 --> 00:40:40.942
They lose their minds

531
00:40:41.027 --> 00:40:43.304
My milkshake brings all
the boys to the yard

532
00:40:43.389 --> 00:40:45.109
Damn right, it's better than yours

533
00:40:45.191 --> 00:40:48.664
I could teach you,
but I'd have to charge

534
00:40:50.316 --> 00:40:53.277
You happy? Fatty make a funny?
