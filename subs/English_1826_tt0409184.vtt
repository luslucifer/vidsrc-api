1
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.785
Voilà! I'm on the road again...

2
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.880
Shit!

3
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.300
Battery depleted.

4
00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:01.775
Thirty years old...
You gotta take stock.


5
00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:05.150
If I look at my life,
it's not impressive.


6
00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:07.240
What've I done?

7
00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:11.660
I was madly in love with one girl.
Martine.


8
00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:13.530
No, that's not it.

9
00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:17.165
Then I was madly in love
with another. Neus.


10
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.500
Okay...

11
00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.460
this story's already a big mess.

12
00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:22.505
That's because I'm a mess.

13
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.005
Let me sort things out.

14
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.840
"Writing is sorting out
the mess of life."


15
00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:31.429
I'm not telling this in order.
Order's a real mess.


16
00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:36.392
So, that's me.
Last month, in Russia, for a wedding.


17
00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:39.729
Those are people I used to know.

18
00:01:40.813 --> 00:01:42.857
Okay, here goes.
Five years ago,


19
00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.028
I went to Barcelona
to study economics.


20
00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:48.905
I met them all there.

21
00:01:49.072 --> 00:01:51.199
We shared an apartment for a year.

22
00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:04.545
We lost touch, then reconnected
here, in Saint Petersburg.


23
00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:09.384
Because William, that guy,
is marrying a Russian, Natasha.


24
00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:11.094
Her.

25
00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:17.725
A monumental event
is about to take place in my life.


26
00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:25.275
Something really fundamental.

27
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:35.994
But to explain why
this thing's so fundamental to me,


28
00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:38.413
let's jump back a year.

29
00:04:27.647 --> 00:04:32.527
RUSSIAN DOLLS

30
00:04:36.072 --> 00:04:37.865
Voilà! Now, I write.

31
00:04:38.032 --> 00:04:39.032
My job is telling stories.

32
00:04:40.701 --> 00:04:44.122
But this woman has heard
some of my best stories.


33
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.041
Mrs. V., my bank officer.

34
00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:49.377
They can't pay me for two months.

35
00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:52.130
But they said...
And this will interest you.


36
00:04:52.338 --> 00:04:55.383
Because I'm like you.
I said,


37
00:04:55.883 --> 00:04:58.094
"That's scandalous! 
You can't do that.

38
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:00.888
"France has strict laws
protecting writers."


39
00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:03.224
I was very, very angry.

40
00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:05.143
What is of interest here?

41
00:05:05.435 --> 00:05:07.437
Well, they said,

42
00:05:08.062 --> 00:05:11.107
since they couldn't pay me
in a timely fashion,


43
00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:13.025
when they do pay me,

44
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:16.571
they'll take a "late penalty"
into account.


45
00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:18.739
Meaning? I don't understand.

46
00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:23.244
Since they're late,
they'll pay me more.


47
00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:26.914
How much more?

48
00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:29.417
I think they said, "Much, much more."

49
00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:33.087
So my job is
to play a merry tune.

50
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:37.300
We typically need writers like you
for personalities


51
00:05:37.508 --> 00:05:39.760
who are writing their memoirs

52
00:05:39.886 --> 00:05:42.221
and can't put two words together.

53
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.265
Can you do that?

54
00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.434
Ghostwriting?

55
00:05:47.185 --> 00:05:48.936
Yes... no... that's...

56
00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:51.439
Sure, I can be a ghostwriter.

57
00:05:51.606 --> 00:05:52.607
I think...

58
00:05:52.773 --> 00:05:54.650
I preferred to work there.

59
00:05:54.817 --> 00:05:57.278
I can ghostwrite for anyone.

60
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.158
I love fiction
when it's connected to reality...


61
00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:07.371
There was a huge amount
of work there...


62
00:06:10.708 --> 00:06:12.710
So that's the job!
Know what I mean?


63
00:06:12.877 --> 00:06:15.254
Now I'm working
all over the place.


64
00:06:15.463 --> 00:06:18.799
Plum has a roundness, a warmth,

65
00:06:19.133 --> 00:06:22.136
a certain femininity, yet elegance...

66
00:06:22.261 --> 00:06:24.805
Some guys like hot dog or freestyle.

67
00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:26.933
So you need different gear.

68
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:28.809
Hardware's always been reliable.

69
00:06:28.976 --> 00:06:30.978
OS X makes the difference.

70
00:06:31.145 --> 00:06:33.940
- You mean the equipment?
- No, the ride.


71
00:06:34.148 --> 00:06:37.068
It's chic, not la-di-da.
Hip, yet cool.


72
00:06:37.318 --> 00:06:40.863
- For me, you gotta go freestyle.
- That's color!


73
00:06:47.537 --> 00:06:49.747
Doesn't that kill the trees?

74
00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:54.710
So...

75
00:06:54.877 --> 00:06:57.338
Do you trim them several times a year?

76
00:06:58.214 --> 00:07:00.508
- What do you think?
- Yes? No?


77
00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:02.885
I don't know. I have no idea.

78
00:07:03.052 --> 00:07:05.346
Do grapes grow in winter?

79
00:07:05.513 --> 00:07:08.558
You've been busting my balls
for an hour.


80
00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:11.852
I'm a Parisian,
I don't know this plant shit.


81
00:07:12.687 --> 00:07:15.856
I'm like you,
I got a boring shit job.


82
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.527
I don't give a fuck.
If my questions are stupid,


83
00:07:19.652 --> 00:07:21.654
don't answer and I'll take off!

84
00:07:21.862 --> 00:07:23.698
A little on edge, are we?

85
00:07:24.448 --> 00:07:26.033
Sorry. I haven't slept,

86
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.535
I'm having a shitty day.

87
00:07:27.702 --> 00:07:29.287
Yeah, I'm on edge.

88
00:07:29.662 --> 00:07:32.248
- You Parisians!
- Stop! Enough!


89
00:07:32.415 --> 00:07:33.624
Laurent!

90
00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:39.005
Stop! That side's fine.
The façade's clear!


91
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.258
- When's your shit due?
- In two weeks.


92
00:07:42.425 --> 00:07:45.928
People seem to think
I'm good at love stories.


93
00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:50.766
We're doing a special "love series"
by young writers this summer.


94
00:07:50.933 --> 00:07:52.393
Oh, I'd love to.

95
00:07:53.978 --> 00:07:58.774
So it's gone pretty well this year.
I even got a TV script to write.


96
00:08:02.987 --> 00:08:04.572
Sort of the ultimate!

97
00:08:09.827 --> 00:08:12.163
We read your story with great interest.

98
00:08:12.997 --> 00:08:16.208
It has enormous quality,
but a few scenes


99
00:08:16.334 --> 00:08:17.627
did make us flinch.

100
00:08:17.793 --> 00:08:19.587
More than flinch, even.

101
00:08:22.632 --> 00:08:23.758
Scene 57.

102
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.013
Why doesn't John Edward kiss Odile
during the thunderstorm?


103
00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:31.432
Yes, why? We want them to kiss.

104
00:08:31.682 --> 00:08:33.267
I want them to kiss.

105
00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:36.604
I don't know.
I didn't want to be too cliché.


106
00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:41.651
We so expect it, it's more interesting
if they don't kiss.


107
00:08:41.817 --> 00:08:45.363
But why deprive the audience
of that pleasure?


108
00:08:46.989 --> 00:08:48.616
It airs over the holidays.

109
00:08:48.783 --> 00:08:52.787
It's a marvelous gift to our viewers.
Don't be afraid of clichés.


110
00:08:53.788 --> 00:08:54.997
I more than agree.

111
00:08:55.289 --> 00:08:58.125
It's a sequel.
Wooded Bliss was a huge hit.


112
00:08:58.292 --> 00:09:02.630
The audience is clamoring for
Love Passion in Venice. Go for it.


113
00:09:03.005 --> 00:09:07.802
Everyone's dying to see how John Edward
and Odile finally fall in love.


114
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.516
John Edward's handsome,
Odile's beautiful,


115
00:09:13.683 --> 00:09:16.936
they're in Venice,
the most beautiful city in the world!


116
00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:18.729
Let yourself go, Xavier!

117
00:09:18.938 --> 00:09:20.690
We all love postcards.

118
00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:23.609
We all love sunsets.
Why deny us that?


119
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.158
Put them in gondolas!

120
00:09:35.955 --> 00:09:38.040
I must sell Wooded Bliss.

121
00:09:39.375 --> 00:09:40.876
But why, John Edward?

122
00:09:42.503 --> 00:09:43.629
Why?

123
00:09:50.052 --> 00:09:51.387
I'm getting a divorce.

124
00:09:53.013 --> 00:09:54.515
Does your wife know?

125
00:09:56.684 --> 00:09:57.977
Yes.

126
00:09:58.102 --> 00:09:59.729
I've told her everything.

127
00:09:59.895 --> 00:10:00.980
But that's marvelous.

128
00:10:02.898 --> 00:10:04.191
Ridiculous!

129
00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:05.860
Yes, marvelous...

130
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.406
- It's not ridiculous.
- Come on...


131
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.534
You hate love stories.
Lots of people love them.


132
00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:15.327
It's not ridiculous to them.

133
00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:17.204
So, you're doing the sequel?

134
00:10:18.122 --> 00:10:19.206
I love you.

135
00:10:19.373 --> 00:10:21.041
Well, I hope it pays well.

136
00:10:21.375 --> 00:10:23.753
It pays better than my articles.

137
00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:25.796
So it's adios to your book?

138
00:10:26.005 --> 00:10:28.340
I can't do everything at once.

139
00:10:28.466 --> 00:10:29.800
Did you like it, Lucas?

140
00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:31.594
I liked it a lot.

141
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:34.221
Maybe it's not what I dreamed of.

142
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:38.058
But it's a stepping-stone.
I'm learning a ton.


143
00:10:40.436 --> 00:10:42.104
But who can that be?

144
00:10:43.063 --> 00:10:44.398
Are you expecting anyone?

145
00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:50.070
I wrote a book, L'
Auberge Espagnole,

146
00:10:50.237 --> 00:10:54.283
I haven't found a publisher,
but I still have hope.


147
00:10:56.619 --> 00:10:57.828
Barbara, what does this mean?

148
00:10:59.747 --> 00:11:01.165
I knew I'd find you here.

149
00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:05.002
So, she's the one!

150
00:11:05.127 --> 00:11:08.214
You disappoint me.
I thought she'd at least be...


151
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.094
Yes.

152
00:11:14.762 --> 00:11:18.599
Yes, who? Yes, what?
Can't you say who you are?


153
00:11:18.766 --> 00:11:21.477
Everyone else does, why can't you?

154
00:11:21.644 --> 00:11:24.104
What do you want me to say?
"It's your mommy?"


155
00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:26.941
Everyone else does.
Why can't you?


156
00:11:27.817 --> 00:11:31.862
Gimme a break!
You want me to be like everyone else.


157
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:33.072
It's grampa...

158
00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:34.281
Hold on.

159
00:11:34.865 --> 00:11:36.617
I was sure you'd forget.

160
00:11:37.326 --> 00:11:38.285
Hi, it's Martine.

161
00:11:38.452 --> 00:11:39.787
I'm on the other line.

162
00:11:39.954 --> 00:11:40.871
Quick!

163
00:11:41.205 --> 00:11:42.456
Okay, go ahead.

164
00:11:42.623 --> 00:11:45.000
- About tonight...
- Oh, happy birthday.


165
00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:46.794
You didn't forget?

166
00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:48.087
You done?

167
00:11:48.212 --> 00:11:51.340
Mom, hold on. It's Martine.
It's her birthday.


168
00:11:51.507 --> 00:11:54.176
Wish her happy birthday for me.

169
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.512
My mother says, "Happy birthday."

170
00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:58.806
- Tell her "thanks."
- What time tonight?


171
00:11:59.431 --> 00:12:02.643
- He expects you for dinner tonight.
- Hold on, mom. Not you.


172
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.812
I don't know, nine.

173
00:12:04.937 --> 00:12:06.146
That works.

174
00:12:06.355 --> 00:12:07.523
I gotta go.

175
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.774
Xavier!

176
00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:10.484
Hold on. Not you, mom.

177
00:12:11.151 --> 00:12:12.194
Give me...

178
00:12:13.821 --> 00:12:14.905
The code.

179
00:12:15.114 --> 00:12:17.992
My new door code is 20B10.

180
00:12:19.994 --> 00:12:21.829
Okay, I've really gotta go...

181
00:12:22.496 --> 00:12:24.665
Mom, hold on!

182
00:12:25.374 --> 00:12:27.585
- Hi, Mrs. Lopez.
- You have to pick up your mail.


183
00:12:27.793 --> 00:12:30.129
It's been piling up for a week.

184
00:12:30.713 --> 00:12:32.840
Can I borrow a DVD?

185
00:12:33.007 --> 00:12:34.675
You done yet?

186
00:12:34.842 --> 00:12:39.555
I caught you off guard the other day,
and now I'm a little off guard...


187
00:12:39.722 --> 00:12:40.806
Coming, mom.

188
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:45.603
I'll stop back later.

189
00:12:48.606 --> 00:12:51.025
All clear? Can I talk now?

190
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:52.484
Is it my turn?

191
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.945
You've got grampa tonight.

192
00:12:55.154 --> 00:12:56.030
I'll be there!

193
00:12:56.488 --> 00:12:58.699
My neighbor, Mr. Boubaker,

194
00:12:58.866 --> 00:13:01.869
is the most uninteresting guy on earth.

195
00:13:02.036 --> 00:13:03.203
Hey...

196
00:13:03.704 --> 00:13:04.872
You know what?

197
00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:07.041
The Big Bang theory doesn't work.

198
00:13:07.207 --> 00:13:11.629
They said on the radio this morning
it may not be true.


199
00:13:11.837 --> 00:13:13.631
Well, no one knows for sure.

200
00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:15.049
If he only knew.

201
00:13:15.215 --> 00:13:18.260
When I write a story,
I always think of Mr. Boubaker.


202
00:13:18.427 --> 00:13:22.264
I try to imagine the scene
with "Mr. Average Guy."


203
00:13:24.058 --> 00:13:26.393
That's him! "Mr. Average Guy."

204
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.439
It's rare to meet one.
There aren't that many in real life.


205
00:13:30.606 --> 00:13:32.566
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.


206
00:13:33.317 --> 00:13:35.319
- But who can it be?
- I don't know.


207
00:13:38.405 --> 00:13:40.908
Oh, Barbara, what does this mean?

208
00:13:41.075 --> 00:13:42.993
I thought I'd find you here.

209
00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:46.288
So, she's the one.

210
00:13:47.456 --> 00:13:48.749
You disappoint me.

211
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.627
I thought she'd at least be...

212
00:13:52.002 --> 00:13:53.253
She'd be what?

213
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.297
Yeah, she'd be what?

214
00:14:16.944 --> 00:14:18.112
Excuse me.

215
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:20.322
What's your girlfriend like?

216
00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:22.449
It's not for my girlfriend.

217
00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:25.327
I don't have a girlfriend.

218
00:14:25.494 --> 00:14:28.497
What's this girl
who's not your girlfriend like?


219
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:31.917
She's a little shorter than you.

220
00:14:32.042 --> 00:14:34.461
She has smaller... I mean...

221
00:14:34.837 --> 00:14:37.131
I think she's size one or two.

222
00:14:37.297 --> 00:14:39.800
It depends. Is she thinner than I am?

223
00:14:40.634 --> 00:14:42.136
Is she like that girl?

224
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:45.305
No.

225
00:14:48.684 --> 00:14:50.978
She's more like her.

226
00:14:51.478 --> 00:14:52.980
But not as ugly.

227
00:14:54.606 --> 00:14:56.150
Take the two.

228
00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.862
Your girlfriend can always exchange it.

229
00:15:02.281 --> 00:15:03.991
The register's over there.

230
00:15:04.158 --> 00:15:07.995
By the way,
I've been a bachelor for a year.


231
00:15:08.328 --> 00:15:09.747
I love your hair.

232
00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:15.335
I prefer that you leave.

233
00:15:16.211 --> 00:15:17.379
Really?

234
00:15:19.214 --> 00:15:20.674
I'm sorry, I'm very modest.

235
00:15:21.216 --> 00:15:22.843
Look, I've gotta run.

236
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.304
Okay, I'm going!

237
00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:27.765
I wasn't chasing you out.

238
00:15:27.973 --> 00:15:30.851
Don't sweat it. 
I'm outta here!

239
00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:34.521
That was great. I had a blast.
Thanks a lot.


240
00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:37.316
Why are you talking like that?

241
00:15:37.524 --> 00:15:39.693
Because I'm a big jerk.

242
00:15:40.194 --> 00:15:41.528
So...

243
00:15:42.362 --> 00:15:44.782
I just wanted to say
I'm a bachelor...


244
00:15:50.537 --> 00:15:51.371
Bye.

245
00:15:58.462 --> 00:16:02.716
Not to be too insistent...
this really isn't for my girlfriend.


246
00:16:04.802 --> 00:16:06.720
It's no biggie. Who cares?

247
00:16:06.887 --> 00:16:09.264
I don't have a girlfriend.

248
00:16:09.431 --> 00:16:11.558
It's for my ex. 
For her birthday.

249
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.728
I'll give you my number.

250
00:16:14.895 --> 00:16:16.063
For...?

251
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.397
I don't know.

252
00:16:18.732 --> 00:16:21.360
If the dress doesn't fit,
you can call me.


253
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.905
No, I don't know.

254
00:16:25.072 --> 00:16:28.158
I've always dreamed of doing that
but I never dared.


255
00:16:28.367 --> 00:16:30.911
With you, I thought I should dare.

256
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.248
Take it, 'cause I feel like a jerk.

257
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:37.251
I'll jot it down.

258
00:16:37.709 --> 00:16:40.629
But you have to call tonight.
Or you never will.


259
00:16:41.296 --> 00:16:42.422
There.

260
00:16:44.842 --> 00:16:45.926
I don't know.

261
00:16:46.093 --> 00:16:47.261
Yes, yes!

262
00:16:47.719 --> 00:16:49.471
You've got nothing to lose.

263
00:16:49.638 --> 00:16:51.598
If I were you, I'd call me.

264
00:18:01.835 --> 00:18:04.588
I also wrote an article for snowb...

265
00:18:05.672 --> 00:18:08.675
for a magazine about winter sports.

266
00:18:09.384 --> 00:18:11.011
What about your novel?

267
00:18:12.262 --> 00:18:13.472
Yeah.

268
00:18:15.515 --> 00:18:17.601
I'm trying, but it's not easy.

269
00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:21.146
At least these little jobs

270
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:23.523
help me pay the rent.

271
00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:25.275
This is temporary.

272
00:18:25.484 --> 00:18:27.027
Be careful.

273
00:18:27.194 --> 00:18:30.864
Sometimes these temporary things
can last a long time.


274
00:18:31.865 --> 00:18:32.824
Meaning?

275
00:18:33.825 --> 00:18:36.411
Don't forget to write important things.

276
00:18:37.496 --> 00:18:40.082
You're good at that. 
You always were.

277
00:18:41.875 --> 00:18:44.169
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

278
00:18:45.295 --> 00:18:46.630
I'll tell Aïcha.

279
00:18:51.218 --> 00:18:55.180
So, little Xavier,
when do I get to meet your fiancée?


280
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.516
Uh, yeah...

281
00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:01.520
Well, yeah, that's right...

282
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.303
I'm a size one. 
You know that!

283
00:19:34.886 --> 00:19:36.096
You think I'm fat.

284
00:19:36.263 --> 00:19:38.432
It's okay. I can exchange it.

285
00:19:38.807 --> 00:19:40.559
I never wear dresses.

286
00:19:40.684 --> 00:19:43.312
Why do you girls have
such a problem with dresses?


287
00:19:43.478 --> 00:19:45.105
First, I'm not "girls."

288
00:19:45.272 --> 00:19:48.567
I wear pants.
It's more practical on a bike.


289
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.612
Anyway, thank you very much.

290
00:19:52.988 --> 00:19:54.281
It's...

291
00:19:55.115 --> 00:19:57.117
No, it's pretty. Really.

292
00:19:58.577 --> 00:20:00.454
Now you'll say I'm a pain.

293
00:20:00.662 --> 00:20:01.955
You're a pain.

294
00:20:03.707 --> 00:20:05.125
No, thanks.

295
00:20:05.292 --> 00:20:06.376
Really?

296
00:20:14.051 --> 00:20:14.926
By the way...

297
00:20:15.635 --> 00:20:17.804
there's the Social Forum.

298
00:20:17.971 --> 00:20:20.682
It's in Porto Alegre, in Brazil.

299
00:20:21.308 --> 00:20:22.976
I can't miss that.

300
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.644
Could you maybe...?

301
00:20:25.312 --> 00:20:27.481
I can take care of Lucas.

302
00:20:28.648 --> 00:20:30.650
Does he ever see his father?

303
00:20:36.198 --> 00:20:38.325
I'd rather not discuss it.

304
00:20:39.326 --> 00:20:40.660
It's that bad?

305
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.662
Yeah.

306
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:47.667
You with anyone?

307
00:20:49.002 --> 00:20:50.212
No.

308
00:20:51.338 --> 00:20:53.215
- You?
- No.


309
00:20:56.218 --> 00:20:57.969
Hello, thirties!

310
00:21:03.517 --> 00:21:04.768
Kassia?

311
00:21:07.396 --> 00:21:08.438
Oh, yeah!

312
00:21:09.022 --> 00:21:10.190
How are you?

313
00:21:10.357 --> 00:21:13.693
I'm glad you called.
Sure I know who you are!


314
00:21:14.653 --> 00:21:16.321
No, no bother at all.

315
00:21:19.032 --> 00:21:20.534
What are you doing?

316
00:21:35.006 --> 00:21:36.216
Good morning.

317
00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:51.440
More coffee?

318
00:21:51.606 --> 00:21:53.733
No, I really have to go.

319
00:21:54.067 --> 00:21:55.902
I just wanted to say...

320
00:21:56.778 --> 00:21:57.946
What?

321
00:21:58.905 --> 00:22:01.408
It's stupid. I just wanted to say...

322
00:22:02.617 --> 00:22:04.244
I never do that.

323
00:22:07.914 --> 00:22:09.082
We'll talk later?

324
00:22:23.513 --> 00:22:24.806
You in love?

325
00:22:25.182 --> 00:22:27.058
Something's going on.

326
00:22:27.309 --> 00:22:29.769
I really like black girls.

327
00:22:30.145 --> 00:22:32.939
You like anything with a pussy!

328
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.774
Why'd you say that?

329
00:22:34.941 --> 00:22:37.986
You cruise every chick on the street.

330
00:22:40.947 --> 00:22:43.533
But me, I don't
get the time of day!

331
00:22:43.742 --> 00:22:45.994
- Stop!
- Stop what?


332
00:22:48.121 --> 00:22:51.750
I'm really embarrassed to ask,
but I'm in deep shit.


333
00:22:52.292 --> 00:22:55.128
Thomas got dumped by his girlfriend.

334
00:22:56.546 --> 00:22:58.840
He's taking the apartment back.

335
00:22:59.633 --> 00:23:02.344
Can I stay with you or...?

336
00:23:03.678 --> 00:23:05.180
No problem, Xavier.

337
00:23:05.347 --> 00:23:06.973
- Oh, really?
- What?


338
00:23:07.182 --> 00:23:09.559
He moves in
and you don't even ask me?


339
00:23:09.768 --> 00:23:13.230
No! You piss me off.
All you do is give me shit!


340
00:23:13.438 --> 00:23:16.149
It's my place
and I don't need your permission


341
00:23:16.316 --> 00:23:17.901
to invite a friend over.

342
00:23:18.985 --> 00:23:21.196
If it's not the moment...

343
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.364
Fine.

344
00:23:26.826 --> 00:23:27.994
Caro!

345
00:23:32.332 --> 00:23:34.876
I'm really mortified. I hope...

346
00:23:35.502 --> 00:23:36.920
No, it's fine.

347
00:23:37.128 --> 00:23:38.797
It's just fine.

348
00:23:41.466 --> 00:23:43.343
Cool. When are you coming?

349
00:24:11.037 --> 00:24:12.247
Xavier?

350
00:24:12.414 --> 00:24:13.873
You're here already!

351
00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:17.377
Cool! All moved in?

352
00:24:17.544 --> 00:24:18.545
Yeah.

353
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.171
Great.

354
00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:23.258
I won't bother you guys. 
I've got work.

355
00:24:23.425 --> 00:24:25.302
No sweat. We broke up.

356
00:24:26.595 --> 00:24:29.055
We're both bachelors now, buddy.

357
00:24:29.222 --> 00:24:30.557
- Great!
- Cool, huh?


358
00:24:30.724 --> 00:24:32.392
- Great!
- How about a beer?


359
00:24:33.727 --> 00:24:34.978
Come on in.

360
00:24:35.186 --> 00:24:36.563
I'm impressed.

361
00:24:37.314 --> 00:24:38.315
You like it?

362
00:24:38.857 --> 00:24:40.233
It's really nice!

363
00:24:41.318 --> 00:24:42.652
There's Xavier.

364
00:24:42.944 --> 00:24:45.739
- I think you met.
- Oh, right.


365
00:24:46.948 --> 00:24:48.325
I remember.

366
00:24:48.867 --> 00:24:50.076
Well, I'm...

367
00:24:50.785 --> 00:24:52.078
I'll show you around.

368
00:24:53.413 --> 00:24:54.414
It's really nice.

369
00:24:54.581 --> 00:24:55.915
Well, it's not...

370
00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:58.668
Did you decorate it?

371
00:25:00.086 --> 00:25:01.880
Come, see the bedroom.

372
00:25:02.005 --> 00:25:03.757
Right over here.

373
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:06.593
Make yourself at home.

374
00:25:24.486 --> 00:25:25.987
Careful, it'll fall.

375
00:25:27.822 --> 00:25:29.115
See them, Lucas?

376
00:25:29.783 --> 00:25:33.578
That doesn't hurt the trees.
It makes them stronger.


377
00:25:35.497 --> 00:25:39.918
Take my number.
I'll stop by and we can discuss it.


378
00:25:40.043 --> 00:25:42.170
- That's so nice.
- Not at all.


379
00:25:42.337 --> 00:25:43.630
06...

380
00:25:44.339 --> 00:25:45.632
Come on!

381
00:25:46.841 --> 00:25:48.343
Thank you!

382
00:25:48.927 --> 00:25:52.138
That's so nice.
I didn't know what to do.


383
00:25:52.305 --> 00:25:54.599
You have to take care of flowers!

384
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.144
It's crazy!
People think nature just grows.


385
00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:00.605
We humans have to nurture it.

386
00:26:01.022 --> 00:26:04.317
And euphorbia...
People always over-water them.


387
00:26:04.651 --> 00:26:07.404
Even once a week is too much.

388
00:26:07.612 --> 00:26:08.530
I'll stop by.

389
00:26:11.282 --> 00:26:14.035
Not only does she hook up
with this guy, "Mr. Plane Tree,"


390
00:26:14.202 --> 00:26:16.579
then she sends me up shit creek
without a paddle.


391
00:26:18.998 --> 00:26:20.500
Two seconds.

392
00:26:25.004 --> 00:26:28.007
So, that was the day
she left for Brazil.


393
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.052
As if my life
wasn't already a mess.


394
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.890
"Happy to have finally found her prince,
she agreed to marry him.


395
00:26:36.641 --> 00:26:38.852
"The wedding went on for a week,

396
00:26:39.018 --> 00:26:41.688
"and all the kingdom was invited.

397
00:26:42.522 --> 00:26:45.024
"They had a beautiful castle

398
00:26:45.191 --> 00:26:47.193
"and lived happily ever after."

399
00:26:48.903 --> 00:26:51.740
Go to sleep now, Lucas.
Wanna go pee-pee?


400
00:26:53.032 --> 00:26:55.243
Don't you wanna go pee-pee first?

401
00:26:58.121 --> 00:27:01.666
Hasn't mommy found her prince yet?

402
00:27:04.043 --> 00:27:06.671
Well, I don't really know.

403
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.549
- Has she mentioned it?
- No.


404
00:27:10.717 --> 00:27:13.553
Then I guess
she hasn't found him. But...


405
00:27:13.678 --> 00:27:16.723
she's beautiful, she's intelligent...

406
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.100
If he knew
how much I'd loved his mother.


407
00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:22.353
I guess Martine hasn't told him.

408
00:27:23.062 --> 00:27:25.023
How do you explain that?

409
00:27:25.356 --> 00:27:28.234
I've been with seven guys, uh...
seven princes.


410
00:27:29.903 --> 00:27:32.363
I've lived in different castles.

411
00:27:32.489 --> 00:27:35.283
Xavier was the fourth prince.

412
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:37.410
At the moment,

413
00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.583
I've got a bunch of princes going.

414
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.251
I don't know... I hesitate.

415
00:27:47.587 --> 00:27:49.756
Last week, I met one at a club.

416
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:52.926
Like a ball, a great ball.

417
00:27:53.426 --> 00:27:55.094
I really like him.

418
00:27:56.054 --> 00:27:59.933
He doesn't have a huge castle
but he's got a big motorcycle.


419
00:28:00.058 --> 00:28:01.643
You'd like that.

420
00:28:04.145 --> 00:28:06.064
It's complicated...

421
00:28:06.856 --> 00:28:10.819
Even if things go well,
it's still a little too soon to...


422
00:28:11.778 --> 00:28:13.780
to know if there'll be a wedding.

423
00:28:16.199 --> 00:28:17.534
And then

424
00:28:18.952 --> 00:28:20.286
some people

425
00:28:20.829 --> 00:28:22.664
in the kingdom say,

426
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.293
if he's the one,
they won't come to the wedding.


427
00:28:38.638 --> 00:28:40.557
Don't cry, mommy.

428
00:28:54.821 --> 00:28:56.531
Mommy!

429
00:29:13.047 --> 00:29:14.132
What's the matter?

430
00:29:18.678 --> 00:29:21.598
- Don't you want your apple?
- No.


431
00:29:21.806 --> 00:29:23.057
There's some left!

432
00:29:24.017 --> 00:29:25.226
You don't want anymore.

433
00:29:31.524 --> 00:29:33.026
Look who's here!

434
00:29:34.527 --> 00:29:35.695
It's mommy!

435
00:29:45.455 --> 00:29:46.831
My sweetie pie!

436
00:29:50.293 --> 00:29:51.544
You okay?

437
00:29:51.878 --> 00:29:53.046
Hi.

438
00:29:53.504 --> 00:29:54.756
Tudo bem?

439
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.760
He was really sick.
He's gotta go to bed.


440
00:29:58.927 --> 00:30:00.053
Really?

441
00:30:01.638 --> 00:30:04.307
I'll put him to bed. 
I'm wiped out.

442
00:30:05.391 --> 00:30:07.185
So, what happened?

443
00:30:07.727 --> 00:30:11.731
The doctor came because I was sick.

444
00:30:11.898 --> 00:30:13.066
Really?

445
00:30:18.112 --> 00:30:19.739
So how was Porto Alegre?

446
00:30:19.906 --> 00:30:21.991
It was great!

447
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.452
There were 216 countries there!

448
00:30:24.619 --> 00:30:28.623
Every continent!
Chili, Mali, Montenegro...


449
00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.333
Tibet!

450
00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:33.753
It was so moving just to be there.

451
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.423
It really makes you feel
connected to the planet.


452
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.593
Did you all agree
to save a doomed world?


453
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:43.304
Hold on!

454
00:30:44.013 --> 00:30:46.265
Give me shit if you want to, but...

455
00:30:46.891 --> 00:30:50.269
globalization
isn't only generating progress.


456
00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:55.274
We have to unite to fight against
disasters that could become inevitable.


457
00:30:56.609 --> 00:30:58.778
You've got the schpeel down.

458
00:30:59.278 --> 00:31:00.780
What's your problem?

459
00:31:01.698 --> 00:31:04.993
While you're saving the world,
I take care of your kid,


460
00:31:05.159 --> 00:31:07.286
I haven't slept in three nights
and I...


461
00:31:07.453 --> 00:31:09.122
You what?

462
00:31:09.622 --> 00:31:11.499
You've done zip with your life.

463
00:31:11.791 --> 00:31:12.625
Me?

464
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:15.378
With those sappy stories of yours?

465
00:31:15.586 --> 00:31:18.673
You lull silly schoolgirls
into dreamland.


466
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.300
"They kiss before the sunset..."

467
00:31:22.677 --> 00:31:23.720
Bullshit.

468
00:31:23.928 --> 00:31:26.723
But what do they dream about?
Pieces of shit.


469
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.018
You know what?
Your work is a load of crap.


470
00:31:30.184 --> 00:31:32.145
It's been crap for two years.

471
00:31:32.687 --> 00:31:34.981
And I know you're better than that.

472
00:31:35.273 --> 00:31:36.816
Wait a minute, I...

473
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.486
You don't give a shit.
You get your lousy two bits,


474
00:31:40.653 --> 00:31:43.031
you're nice and cozy with that.

475
00:31:44.365 --> 00:31:48.745
So you make fun of people who move,
who fight against pollution,


476
00:31:49.078 --> 00:31:51.664
against exclusion, against violence.

477
00:31:51.831 --> 00:31:53.833
Against real things in the real world!

478
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.085
It's easy for you to laugh at that.

479
00:31:56.419 --> 00:31:57.712
That's for sure!

480
00:31:58.046 --> 00:31:59.505
I don't laugh.

481
00:31:59.672 --> 00:32:00.965
You're a parasite.

482
00:32:01.299 --> 00:32:03.426
- I'm a what?
- A parasite.


483
00:32:03.634 --> 00:32:05.344
Happy as a clam,

484
00:32:05.511 --> 00:32:08.056
telling insipid love stories.

485
00:32:08.222 --> 00:32:09.849
That's how it should be!

486
00:32:10.016 --> 00:32:12.685
Don't change a thing.

487
00:32:12.852 --> 00:32:14.353
That seems to satisfy you.

488
00:32:21.986 --> 00:32:23.071
Xavier...

489
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:44.008
Hi, it's me.

490
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:46.385
I'm sorry.

491
00:32:49.806 --> 00:32:51.390
I'm sorry. Really.

492
00:32:54.727 --> 00:32:56.229
And thanks for Lucas.

493
00:33:24.382 --> 00:33:26.300
What's wrong, John Edward?

494
00:33:26.467 --> 00:33:27.468
Nothing.

495
00:33:27.635 --> 00:33:31.097
Yes, there is.
I can see something's wrong.


496
00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.766
I have a terrible secret.

497
00:33:34.433 --> 00:33:35.768
What do you mean?

498
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.314
The company's bankrupt.
I haven't a cent.


499
00:33:40.481 --> 00:33:42.316
The bank called, I'm drowning.

500
00:33:44.152 --> 00:33:45.278
But how?

501
00:33:45.444 --> 00:33:48.948
Venice. It was your dream,
I couldn't let you down.


502
00:33:50.324 --> 00:33:52.076
I have a terrible secret.

503
00:33:52.201 --> 00:33:53.494
What do you mean?

504
00:33:56.205 --> 00:33:57.999
I'm having an affair with Sarah.

505
00:33:59.834 --> 00:34:01.878
How could you do that to me?

506
00:34:02.295 --> 00:34:05.298
My mother's ill,
your dad sold the company


507
00:34:05.464 --> 00:34:07.133
and I've had a car accident.

508
00:34:07.758 --> 00:34:08.676
That's awful!

509
00:34:11.137 --> 00:34:13.973
I have a twin brother, 
John Sebastian.

510
00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:17.768
- We look exactly alike.
- And...?


511
00:34:20.479 --> 00:34:21.981
I'm not me, Odile.

512
00:34:22.648 --> 00:34:23.566
I'm the twin.

513
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.234
What does that mean?

514
00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.153
I don't know.

515
00:34:37.914 --> 00:34:39.498
- Wanna go?
- Maybe.


516
00:34:42.668 --> 00:34:43.836
You okay?

517
00:34:46.464 --> 00:34:48.507
How can I write a love story?

518
00:34:49.217 --> 00:34:51.594
I know nothing about love.

519
00:34:52.595 --> 00:34:54.847
I'm a self-centered egotist.

520
00:34:55.598 --> 00:34:57.600
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.


521
00:34:58.935 --> 00:35:00.478
Careful! Hold me tight.

522
00:35:00.603 --> 00:35:02.480
I've got you. Wait!

523
00:35:04.398 --> 00:35:05.942
Let's go. Be careful.

524
00:35:08.402 --> 00:35:09.946
- You okay?
- Fine.


525
00:35:11.364 --> 00:35:13.574
Watch it here. 
We have to stop.

526
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:16.702
We have to wait for the second light.

527
00:35:16.869 --> 00:35:18.829
- Okay.
- Careful!


528
00:35:19.705 --> 00:35:21.040
It's dangerous.

529
00:35:23.376 --> 00:35:26.212
By the way,
when do I get to meet your fiancée?


530
00:35:26.587 --> 00:35:29.548
- I forgot!
- What do you mean? It's important.


531
00:35:29.715 --> 00:35:30.841
Yeah, I know.

532
00:35:31.717 --> 00:35:33.761
"When do I get to meet
your fiancée?"


533
00:35:33.928 --> 00:35:38.391
I don't know why but
that question started to obsess me.


534
00:35:38.557 --> 00:35:40.893
I had to find the right girl fast,

535
00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.561
before he died.

536
00:35:43.562 --> 00:35:44.647
Hello, Kassia?

537
00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:46.399
Oh, I'm sorry.

538
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.403
Really?
When's she due back from Senegal?


539
00:35:51.946 --> 00:35:53.614
Really?

540
00:35:53.781 --> 00:35:55.741
No big deal. It's Xavier.

541
00:35:55.908 --> 00:35:57.576
Thanks. Bye.

542
00:36:19.557 --> 00:36:20.933
What is it?

543
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.935
Can you come here a sec?

544
00:36:23.102 --> 00:36:24.270
Coming.

545
00:36:28.274 --> 00:36:29.608
So, I...

546
00:36:29.775 --> 00:36:31.652
You okay? Have a good day?

547
00:36:32.278 --> 00:36:33.696
- Great.
- What's up?


548
00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.449
I have a huge favor to ask.

549
00:36:36.615 --> 00:36:40.036
Something you'll hate.
But you absolutely have to say yes.


550
00:36:40.244 --> 00:36:41.287
What?

551
00:36:41.454 --> 00:36:44.790
Somewhere in your closet,
do you have a dress?


552
00:36:44.999 --> 00:36:46.292
A dress?

553
00:36:46.459 --> 00:36:49.128
Never mind, it'll never work.

554
00:36:52.923 --> 00:36:55.384
- It'll be a nightmare.
- I don't have a dress.


555
00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:00.639
- What would I do with a dress?
- I'm sorry.


556
00:37:04.268 --> 00:37:08.147
Stay calm. Don't freak out
and say, "I'm a dyke!"


557
00:37:08.314 --> 00:37:10.483
Don't make it worse. I'm here!

558
00:37:10.649 --> 00:37:11.650
Just a warning.

559
00:37:11.817 --> 00:37:14.612
I'm already
a hair's breath from walking.


560
00:37:14.737 --> 00:37:16.155
This is ridiculous.

561
00:37:16.322 --> 00:37:17.656
Look at this thing.

562
00:37:17.823 --> 00:37:20.034
Shall I go get them, darling?

563
00:37:21.994 --> 00:37:24.830
No, we can go later...
Good evening!


564
00:37:24.997 --> 00:37:26.499
After dinner.

565
00:37:26.665 --> 00:37:30.503
But that's so very kind of you,
my dear.


566
00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:33.547
Or we can blow off the whole thing.

567
00:37:34.173 --> 00:37:35.633
It's so, so pretty here.

568
00:37:35.758 --> 00:37:37.510
Don't talk like that.

569
00:37:37.718 --> 00:37:40.221
- Quit fucking around!
- Isn't that what you want?


570
00:37:40.388 --> 00:37:43.057
Stop! Concentrate.

571
00:37:43.224 --> 00:37:45.893
Quit it!
I'm ringing the bell.


572
00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:46.977
Go ahead.

573
00:37:47.103 --> 00:37:50.356
What are you doing? 
I'm not ready!

574
00:37:54.693 --> 00:37:55.569
Hello.

575
00:37:55.778 --> 00:37:57.196
Hi, grampa.

576
00:37:57.363 --> 00:37:58.906
Hello, sir.

577
00:37:59.073 --> 00:38:02.034
I'm so happy to meet you. Come in!

578
00:38:02.201 --> 00:38:03.744
Isabelle, grampa.

579
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.080
Delighted! Fuck!

580
00:38:06.247 --> 00:38:08.207
- Careful!
- Sorry. Fuck.


581
00:38:09.583 --> 00:38:10.543
Hello, my boy.

582
00:38:13.087 --> 00:38:14.255
Follow me.

583
00:38:14.422 --> 00:38:16.549
I'm so happy to meet you.

584
00:38:16.715 --> 00:38:18.551
Me too. Really!

585
00:38:22.805 --> 00:38:24.890
It's so, so, so pretty.

586
00:38:25.266 --> 00:38:26.475
Isn’t it?

587
00:38:26.684 --> 00:38:27.726
Stop!

588
00:38:29.562 --> 00:38:31.730
Want to know how old I am?

589
00:38:31.897 --> 00:38:34.900
I'm 98. I've seen three wars.

590
00:38:36.402 --> 00:38:39.572
That's incredible!
Extraordinary!


591
00:38:40.698 --> 00:38:43.159
I was born in 1906.

592
00:38:43.367 --> 00:38:46.412
But I won't bore you with all that.

593
00:38:46.579 --> 00:38:49.832
Can you imagine
hearing my life story?


594
00:38:50.374 --> 00:38:51.750
That'd take hours...

595
00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.714
Let's talk about you, miss.

596
00:38:56.839 --> 00:39:00.843
I'm so happy
my grandson has such a pretty fiancée!


597
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.761
Oh, no...

598
00:39:03.429 --> 00:39:05.514
Oh, yes, I insist, very pretty.

599
00:39:06.432 --> 00:39:09.643
Thank you, that's very kind of you.

600
00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:13.272
So, tell me,
what do you do for a living?


601
00:39:13.939 --> 00:39:15.858
Well...

602
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.401
So...

603
00:39:17.526 --> 00:39:20.488
I work for a television station,

604
00:39:20.654 --> 00:39:23.491
where I'm a financial journalist.

605
00:39:25.075 --> 00:39:27.203
Well, what does that mean?

606
00:39:27.411 --> 00:39:30.998
It means I work in the financial world.

607
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.132
I gather tidbits of information
on financial markets, stock options,


608
00:39:40.299 --> 00:39:42.426
what's bought, what's sold.

609
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:46.138
Because traders
- people who work in the market -


610
00:39:46.305 --> 00:39:49.308
need an enormous amount
of info... rmation


611
00:39:49.475 --> 00:39:51.143
on an enormous number...

612
00:39:51.477 --> 00:39:52.811
of things.

613
00:39:54.522 --> 00:39:56.649
Who's interested in all that?

614
00:39:57.149 --> 00:39:58.817
Lots and lots of people.

615
00:39:58.984 --> 00:40:03.155
There are 450 assets management
firms in Paris alone.


616
00:40:03.322 --> 00:40:05.824
It's a very competitive sector.

617
00:40:05.991 --> 00:40:09.036
You gotta kick the other guy
in the balls.


618
00:40:09.203 --> 00:40:12.164
Things move fast,
tons of money's at stake.


619
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:17.378
Once, I got a tip that
Asian markets were about to collapse.


620
00:40:17.545 --> 00:40:19.838
I had to react like that!

621
00:40:20.005 --> 00:40:23.509
For a trader,
that's an explosive situation.


622
00:40:23.676 --> 00:40:25.177
You gotta be on the ball.

623
00:40:25.344 --> 00:40:29.056
That info has gigantic repercussions
on the planet.


624
00:40:29.723 --> 00:40:31.016
What?

625
00:40:41.193 --> 00:40:42.528
I can't do this.

626
00:40:42.695 --> 00:40:45.364
One hour. We're gonna eat. Please.

627
00:40:45.531 --> 00:40:47.366
- Let's go.
- One little hour.


628
00:40:52.371 --> 00:40:55.082
Now I see why you slipped away.

629
00:40:55.874 --> 00:40:56.875
Dinner's ready.

630
00:40:57.042 --> 00:40:59.378
Let's go to the table.

631
00:40:59.753 --> 00:41:01.547
- Go ahead.
- No, you first.


632
00:41:02.381 --> 00:41:03.716
Come on.

633
00:41:16.729 --> 00:41:17.938
Water?

634
00:41:42.421 --> 00:41:43.922
I feel dirty...

635
00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.426
just pretending to be so clean.

636
00:41:48.927 --> 00:41:52.222
Xavier,
the woman you want doesn't exist.


637
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.768
You've gotta grow up.
You want a princess or...


638
00:41:55.934 --> 00:41:57.978
worse, a TV soap heroine!

639
00:42:00.272 --> 00:42:03.442
Stop dreaming!
Princesses only exist in fairytales.


640
00:42:04.276 --> 00:42:06.445
That was bullshit.

641
00:42:09.823 --> 00:42:11.492
Why stop dreaming?

642
00:42:16.914 --> 00:42:19.291
You wanna go out?

643
00:42:19.458 --> 00:42:21.919
Yeah! Because now...

644
00:42:22.378 --> 00:42:24.838
But this time I decide what we do.

645
00:42:34.973 --> 00:42:36.809
I want her so, so pretty.

646
00:42:39.353 --> 00:42:42.981
I'll think I'm king of the world.
No, thanks.


647
00:42:45.484 --> 00:42:46.610
You're having fun!

648
00:42:47.319 --> 00:42:49.655
Xavier's a cute little dish.

649
00:42:54.159 --> 00:42:55.327
You're having fun!

650
00:42:56.161 --> 00:42:57.496
You piggies!

651
00:42:59.665 --> 00:43:01.417
- You okay?
- Yeah, great.


652
00:43:02.668 --> 00:43:05.838
- She'll be beautiful!
- When'll my wife be ready?


653
00:43:06.672 --> 00:43:07.881
Gimme a break.

654
00:43:13.053 --> 00:43:15.055
That's better, isn't it?

655
00:43:15.222 --> 00:43:16.849
Okay, I got it.

656
00:43:19.351 --> 00:43:20.644
Shake your ass!

657
00:43:20.769 --> 00:43:22.354
It suits him!

658
00:43:24.565 --> 00:43:26.692
He's not the type to wear any undies.

659
00:43:28.527 --> 00:43:29.361
Telephone.

660
00:43:29.486 --> 00:43:30.863
Is this yours, cupcake?

661
00:43:32.573 --> 00:43:34.074
Yeah, that's mine.

662
00:43:36.076 --> 00:43:37.703
Hello? Xavier?

663
00:43:39.121 --> 00:43:41.123
My pet...

664
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:42.708
No, that's Isabelle.

665
00:43:44.877 --> 00:43:46.003
You okay?

666
00:43:47.004 --> 00:43:48.088
Yeah. Why?

667
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.882
I don't know, you sound funny.

668
00:43:51.383 --> 00:43:55.220
It's just...
Lucas' father just picked him up.


669
00:43:55.554 --> 00:43:56.722
That's great.

670
00:43:57.097 --> 00:43:59.141
He's sleeping over tonight and...

671
00:44:01.268 --> 00:44:03.103
That's a good thing.

672
00:44:03.395 --> 00:44:05.564
My wife's always on the phone.

673
00:44:06.231 --> 00:44:08.567
That may be her lover.

674
00:44:09.568 --> 00:44:11.069
And I'm all alone.

675
00:44:11.695 --> 00:44:12.738
Who's calling you at this hour?

676
00:44:13.447 --> 00:44:16.450
Your son shouldn't just see women.

677
00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:19.369
Yeah, it's great.

678
00:44:20.245 --> 00:44:21.371
But...

679
00:44:22.831 --> 00:44:24.416
It's just that...

680
00:44:26.126 --> 00:44:27.294
Can I come over?

681
00:44:33.926 --> 00:44:35.427
Yeah, come over.

682
00:44:38.138 --> 00:44:39.723
No, come over.

683
00:44:39.848 --> 00:44:41.433
No bother at all.

684
00:44:45.604 --> 00:44:46.730
Hi.

685
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:52.277
- You're wearing makeup?
- Really?


686
00:44:52.444 --> 00:44:54.530
Yes, you are. It looks nice.

687
00:44:56.532 --> 00:44:58.784
I see you girls are having fun.

688
00:44:59.618 --> 00:45:00.994
So what's the matter?

689
00:45:01.745 --> 00:45:03.789
- Martine, you okay?
- Hi.


690
00:45:03.956 --> 00:45:05.123
How are you?

691
00:45:05.624 --> 00:45:07.167
Good to see you. Come in.

692
00:45:07.334 --> 00:45:08.460
Come on in.

693
00:45:08.627 --> 00:45:12.798
It's really funny.
I just got Martine Goes Camping.


694
00:45:12.965 --> 00:45:14.967
I didn't have that one.

695
00:45:20.973 --> 00:45:22.850
Anyway, it's not easy.

696
00:45:26.478 --> 00:45:29.147
We must seem like
uptight straight people.


697
00:45:33.777 --> 00:45:35.445
That may be true.

698
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:53.130
I think that's a bad idea.

699
00:45:53.255 --> 00:45:54.673
Just for tonight.

700
00:45:59.887 --> 00:46:01.889
It's really not a good idea.

701
00:46:02.055 --> 00:46:03.849
You are uptight, after all.

702
00:46:04.683 --> 00:46:07.144
I'm not uptight. 
I just don't want to.

703
00:46:07.269 --> 00:46:09.062
It's a question of wanting to.

704
00:46:09.229 --> 00:46:13.942
I adore you, but I don't wanna
sleep with you. And neither do you.


705
00:46:16.862 --> 00:46:18.864
I am a pain in the ass.

706
00:46:19.031 --> 00:46:20.532
No, you're not.

707
00:46:20.699 --> 00:46:22.367
I'll never find a guy.

708
00:46:23.535 --> 00:46:25.370
You're right, I'm annoying.

709
00:46:30.292 --> 00:46:32.044
I broke up with Bruno.

710
00:46:33.712 --> 00:46:35.213
Did I mention him?

711
00:46:38.216 --> 00:46:42.095
Sorry, they change so fast,
I can't keep track.


712
00:46:42.888 --> 00:46:46.767
I don't get it. Since you,
I just don't meet guys who...


713
00:46:48.393 --> 00:46:49.645
I don't know.

714
00:46:50.896 --> 00:46:52.564
You expect too much.

715
00:46:55.108 --> 00:46:58.528
You're looking for an ideal guy
who doesn't exist.


716
00:46:58.654 --> 00:47:00.656
You're a big girl now, Martine.

717
00:47:01.782 --> 00:47:04.743
Stop dreaming of "Mr. Perfect."

718
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:06.244
Do something!

719
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:15.587
Come on.

720
00:47:17.673 --> 00:47:19.758
Let's go to my room.

721
00:47:23.095 --> 00:47:25.097
Why are you crying?

722
00:47:25.806 --> 00:47:29.476
Okay, you are a pain,
but you're beautiful, intelligent...


723
00:47:29.935 --> 00:47:31.937
Lots of guys are crazy about you.

724
00:47:32.479 --> 00:47:34.481
I don't give a shit about that.

725
00:47:35.941 --> 00:47:39.277
What if you were a ball-breaker,
ugly, stupid


726
00:47:39.695 --> 00:47:42.781
and no one was hot for you?
You're far from that.


727
00:47:45.993 --> 00:47:48.120
What guys are crazy about me?

728
00:47:49.287 --> 00:47:50.580
I don't know...

729
00:47:54.376 --> 00:47:57.295
Patrick. He said you drive him wild.

730
00:47:57.462 --> 00:47:59.131
Really? Patrick said that?

731
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:06.304
- He said, "Martine drives me wild?"
- Yes!


732
00:48:06.471 --> 00:48:09.808
You seem surprised. There's something
attractive about you, after all.


733
00:48:10.642 --> 00:48:13.145
Okay! You say it like...

734
00:48:19.317 --> 00:48:21.278
Can I sleep with you tonight?

735
00:48:25.032 --> 00:48:26.283
Please.

736
00:48:27.743 --> 00:48:29.077
If you want to.

737
00:48:44.217 --> 00:48:45.343
Shit!

738
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:51.683
Morning!

739
00:48:58.648 --> 00:49:01.526
Thank you. I'm happy I stayed with you.

740
00:49:01.693 --> 00:49:06.239
Yeah, but you can't stay.
I'm expecting a girl... friend.


741
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:09.576
It's no big deal.

742
00:49:09.743 --> 00:49:11.328
Just tell her the truth.

743
00:49:12.037 --> 00:49:15.373
We're old friends and we didn't fuck.

744
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:16.750
Yeah, sure.

745
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.920
She's your girlfriend?

746
00:49:20.462 --> 00:49:21.588
Yeah.

747
00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:26.384
- You have a girlfriend?
- No, not really.


748
00:49:27.219 --> 00:49:29.471
Is she your girlfriend or not?

749
00:49:29.679 --> 00:49:32.557
I don't have a girlfriend,
I have girlfriends.


750
00:49:32.724 --> 00:49:34.434
Do you have a girlfriend or not?

751
00:49:34.601 --> 00:49:37.229
I don't have one, I have lots.
Is that clear?


752
00:49:37.395 --> 00:49:39.898
Oh! I forgot how you were.

753
00:49:40.273 --> 00:49:42.150
Flip out on your own time!

754
00:49:42.359 --> 00:49:44.236
I'm outta here.

755
00:49:44.402 --> 00:49:47.781
Well, yeah.
She's on her way. It'll be a mess.


756
00:49:49.074 --> 00:49:53.578
I have a life. Last night,
you didn't give me a chance to explain


757
00:49:53.745 --> 00:49:56.081
that I had to juggle things
this morning.


758
00:49:59.459 --> 00:50:00.585
Bye.

759
00:50:01.461 --> 00:50:04.131
I'm sorry.
I was afraid you'd run into her.


760
00:50:04.297 --> 00:50:05.799
I understand.

761
00:50:08.093 --> 00:50:09.177
Fuck!

762
00:50:11.179 --> 00:50:13.390
- Who is she?
- No one.


763
00:50:13.515 --> 00:50:14.975
I'm no one?

764
00:50:17.435 --> 00:50:19.062
I'm no one?

765
00:50:21.064 --> 00:50:23.608
You have your life, I have mine.
No problem!


766
00:50:23.775 --> 00:50:26.778
But you'll always be someone to me.
Always.


767
00:50:26.945 --> 00:50:28.488
In anyone's presence.

768
00:50:30.532 --> 00:50:31.867
- Who is she?
- No...


769
00:50:32.075 --> 00:50:33.994
My ex, Martine.

770
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:35.328
Not so "ex".

771
00:50:35.537 --> 00:50:37.831
She is my ex. It's over. Come in.

772
00:50:37.998 --> 00:50:39.291
One in, one out...

773
00:50:39.791 --> 00:50:41.793
That doesn't bother you at all.

774
00:50:42.085 --> 00:50:44.546
You don't understand.

775
00:50:45.797 --> 00:50:48.633
You just line 'em up.
You don't give a fuck.


776
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.636
Exactly.
If you don't like it, take a hike.


777
00:50:51.803 --> 00:50:52.637
What?

778
00:50:52.804 --> 00:50:55.182
Yeah! You're all fucking,
stupid bitches!


779
00:50:55.974 --> 00:50:57.684
You got that? Now get lost!

780
00:51:00.312 --> 00:51:01.646
Asshole.

781
00:51:03.023 --> 00:51:05.233
Yeah, I'm an asshole!

782
00:51:09.905 --> 00:51:12.991
You can't talk to women like that.
Asshole!


783
00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.662
Who is she? I'm a what?

784
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:20.123
Stop! Calm down. You...

785
00:51:20.248 --> 00:51:21.499
I what?

786
00:51:21.666 --> 00:51:25.670
She can't talk to me like that.
You parade your sluts through here...


787
00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:28.340
Fuck, Xavier!

788
00:51:30.508 --> 00:51:33.595
It's not easy for a woman my age
to find a good man.


789
00:51:34.846 --> 00:51:36.848
A good man's hard to find.

790
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:39.351
Yeah, I know.

791
00:51:40.185 --> 00:51:44.189
I want you to meet him.
But no comments!


792
00:51:45.565 --> 00:51:48.151
Chill out, ma! 
You're not 15.

793
00:51:48.735 --> 00:51:52.280
I know what it's like not to find
your soul mate right away.


794
00:51:52.489 --> 00:51:54.532
Don't worry, I've been briefed.

795
00:51:54.699 --> 00:51:57.035
Still, we humans are a funny race.

796
00:51:57.702 --> 00:52:01.039
Did you know that
a hippopotamus chooses one mate


797
00:52:01.206 --> 00:52:03.500
and they stay together for life?

798
00:52:04.709 --> 00:52:05.877
Did you know that?

799
00:52:07.087 --> 00:52:08.046
No.

800
00:52:09.923 --> 00:52:11.508
Isn’t that marvelous?

801
00:52:18.723 --> 00:52:19.891
This is it?

802
00:52:20.558 --> 00:52:22.185
- He lives here?
- Yeah.


803
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:24.562
- You, too?
- For three months now.


804
00:52:24.729 --> 00:52:26.439
Okay, I get it.

805
00:52:26.606 --> 00:52:28.984
- You get what?
- Why he's a good man.


806
00:52:29.192 --> 00:52:31.861
- Stop!
- I see why you're with him.


807
00:52:32.445 --> 00:52:34.281
No comments. You promised.

808
00:52:35.323 --> 00:52:37.242
- Are you freaking out?
- No.


809
00:52:37.784 --> 00:52:38.868
Yes, you are.

810
00:52:38.994 --> 00:52:41.246
You'll make me freak out for real.

811
00:52:41.538 --> 00:52:43.540
We used to cut the world in two.

812
00:52:43.665 --> 00:52:47.669
Capitalists, Marxists; exploiters,
exploited; the Right, the Left.


813
00:52:47.877 --> 00:52:48.920
That worked pretty well.

814
00:52:49.587 --> 00:52:51.423
Those oppositions don't work anymore.

815
00:52:52.215 --> 00:52:55.927
Today, one world strips women bare,
another veils them.


816
00:52:58.096 --> 00:53:01.808
That's the real opposition today.
In our image of women.


817
00:53:02.475 --> 00:53:04.102
Yeah, that's true.

818
00:53:19.617 --> 00:53:21.703
So I finally finished a new draft.

819
00:53:21.911 --> 00:53:24.998
But France TV
had a little surprise for me.


820
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.003
They said that
an Australian satellite "bouquet"...


821
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:31.671
Or was it German?

822
00:53:31.838 --> 00:53:36.343
TS6 is a silent partner of PassionTV,
through Eurosat 2000.


823
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:38.303
Yeah, that's it.

824
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:42.515
It was some sort of "bouquet" buy-out
by God knows who.


825
00:53:43.475 --> 00:53:48.480
Anyway, Love Passion in Venice
was now a BBC 2 co-production.


826
00:53:48.646 --> 00:53:50.482
So the script had to be in English.

827
00:53:50.815 --> 00:53:51.733
Oh, really?

828
00:53:52.317 --> 00:53:55.195
Their BBC counterparts are currently

829
00:53:55.362 --> 00:54:00.158
putting together a pool
of screenwriters. And so, that's that.


830
00:54:00.492 --> 00:54:05.497
Sorry. We know how much you've
invested in Love Passion in Venice.


831
00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:10.168
He said, "Those are
the vagaries of globalization."


832
00:54:10.668 --> 00:54:12.670
You're a victim of globalization.

833
00:54:13.004 --> 00:54:14.506
That made me feel better.

834
00:54:14.839 --> 00:54:17.300
Hold on, I speak English.

835
00:54:20.845 --> 00:54:22.013
Meaning?

836
00:54:22.514 --> 00:54:25.225
You think you can write in English?

837
00:54:25.392 --> 00:54:28.686
Of course. I've even written
screenplays in English.


838
00:54:28.853 --> 00:54:31.106
Can we submit them
to our co-producers?


839
00:54:31.356 --> 00:54:32.399
Yes.

840
00:54:32.565 --> 00:54:34.692
Well, that's a bit complicated...

841
00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.530
I wrote them when I was in Barcelona...

842
00:54:38.988 --> 00:54:43.243
I think the publisher's production arm
may have gone bankrupt.


843
00:55:07.225 --> 00:55:09.060
Hello, Paris!

844
00:55:10.019 --> 00:55:12.063
I'm a Parisian!

845
00:55:13.064 --> 00:55:15.817
Gimme some escargot and red wine!

846
00:55:22.615 --> 00:55:23.950
Do you speak French?

847
00:55:25.118 --> 00:55:26.744
Wanna sleep with me?

848
00:57:21.859 --> 00:57:25.029
Hi. I was talking about the lights.

849
00:57:25.697 --> 00:57:28.616
I have to work a little longer.
Just a bit.


850
00:57:32.537 --> 00:57:33.705
I need...

851
00:57:34.497 --> 00:57:35.832
the light.

852
00:57:35.957 --> 00:57:38.167
to work. Like that.

853
00:57:39.794 --> 00:57:41.379
Like the sun.

854
00:57:42.547 --> 00:57:43.548
On stage.

855
00:57:52.599 --> 00:57:54.058
Thank you very much.

856
00:57:54.225 --> 00:57:57.895
I'll just be a little while.
My name is Natasha.


857
00:58:00.273 --> 00:58:02.108
Thank you, William.

858
00:58:04.736 --> 00:58:05.862
Bye.

859
00:58:20.793 --> 00:58:22.086
So, there it is.

860
00:58:22.253 --> 00:58:24.922
A love story is above all a story.

861
00:59:16.182 --> 00:59:17.475
It was good?

862
00:59:19.018 --> 00:59:20.353
Thank you.

863
00:59:21.979 --> 00:59:23.314
You liked it?

864
00:59:26.067 --> 00:59:27.819
In what way?

865
00:59:30.405 --> 00:59:33.199
You liked the way I danced?

866
00:59:36.661 --> 00:59:39.163
You liked it. Okay. Thanks.

867
00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:42.500
Bye.

868
01:01:03.956 --> 01:01:05.374
Natasha!

869
01:01:06.751 --> 01:01:08.419
Do you remember me?

870
01:01:08.753 --> 01:01:10.379
Yes, I remember.

871
01:01:11.047 --> 01:01:14.425
A year ago, when
you got on that bus,

872
01:01:15.468 --> 01:01:18.095
you gave me this little piece of paper.

873
01:01:18.763 --> 01:01:21.933
I decided to learn Russian

874
01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:24.769
just so I could speak to you.

875
01:01:25.937 --> 01:01:27.855
I've dreamed of this moment.

876
01:01:29.273 --> 01:01:31.609
I'm staying at the Moskva Hotel.

877
01:01:34.278 --> 01:01:35.446
This time,

878
01:01:36.656 --> 01:01:39.534
I'll give you a little piece of paper.

879
01:01:41.118 --> 01:01:43.746
I apologize if this is... weird.

880
01:01:45.623 --> 01:01:47.250
Call me.

881
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.794
If you want to.

882
01:01:51.462 --> 01:01:52.588
Okay.

883
01:03:00.031 --> 01:03:02.533
We proposed your English screenwriter.

884
01:03:02.867 --> 01:03:04.285
They know her well.

885
01:03:04.827 --> 01:03:07.663
They agreed.
You can leave for London anytime.


886
01:03:10.374 --> 01:03:14.086
All travel and expenses
will be reimbursed.


887
01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:16.714
Great!

888
01:03:20.718 --> 01:03:22.553
We certainly owe you that.

889
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:44.481
Wendy was always like a sister to me,

890
01:07:44.648 --> 01:07:46.150
like a mirror image.

891
01:07:46.817 --> 01:07:49.820
I realized I wasn't
the only one who screwed up.


892
01:07:49.987 --> 01:07:54.491
Wendy's great. She must've really
been in love to get to this state.


893
01:07:55.159 --> 01:07:57.995
How'd she ever wind up
with a guy like that?


894
01:07:58.287 --> 01:08:01.999
How can so many sincere moments,
one after the other,


895
01:08:02.166 --> 01:08:04.001
lead to such misery?

896
01:08:04.835 --> 01:08:06.295
Who'd want that?

897
01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:12.927
I don't remember
how we finally got started.


898
01:08:20.851 --> 01:08:23.854
After breakfast, we'd work for hours.

899
01:09:18.242 --> 01:09:21.453
When we'd had it,
we'd go next door for a bite.


900
01:09:21.662 --> 01:09:23.914
Where have you been all this time?

901
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:34.758
Coming.

902
01:10:59.968 --> 01:11:01.303
We went to bed late.

903
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:05.224
Even after work,
we couldn't stop talking.


904
01:11:29.206 --> 01:11:30.833
Hello, Mr. Rousseau?

905
01:11:30.999 --> 01:11:32.876
It's Michel Hermann. Hello.

906
01:11:34.002 --> 01:11:39.591
Tell me, does the name Celia Shelburn
mean anything to you?


907
01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.510
Celia Shelburn? Of course!

908
01:11:41.677 --> 01:11:45.597
Really? I only heard of her last week.

909
01:11:46.223 --> 01:11:50.269
She's 24
and she's going to write her memoirs.


910
01:11:50.686 --> 01:11:55.190
She's got lots to tell,
so you've got lots to write.


911
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.569
So I had to rush back to Paris

912
01:11:58.735 --> 01:12:01.405
to start my new job
with Celia Shelburn.


913
01:12:52.331 --> 01:12:55.417
Anyway, it's 46B28.

914
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:16.897
I have red wine, Diet Coke.

915
01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:30.994
I love...

916
01:13:32.704 --> 01:13:34.331
It was funny.

917
01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:40.587
We can speak French, if you prefer.
I speak French, too.


918
01:13:40.712 --> 01:13:43.340
You speak French? Okay. Fine.

919
01:13:59.022 --> 01:14:01.358
By 18, I'd toured the world
several times.


920
01:14:02.192 --> 01:14:03.443
Really?

921
01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:35.225
It's such a drag to be so famous.

922
01:14:35.892 --> 01:14:37.769
Yeah, I imagine.

923
01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:42.566
Do you see the
boats pass by at night?

924
01:14:42.733 --> 01:14:45.819
Yeah, it's beautiful. I love that.

925
01:14:46.695 --> 01:14:48.739
I've always dreamed of seeing that.

926
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:53.368
Celia, I've gotta go!

927
01:14:56.288 --> 01:14:57.623
I lost track of time!

928
01:15:15.682 --> 01:15:21.271
Every morning, she had a cardboard
croissant from the Pakistani deli.


929
01:15:21.396 --> 01:15:23.649
I told her
those things were disgusting.


930
01:15:23.815 --> 01:15:26.401
But she said she really liked...

931
01:15:26.526 --> 01:15:28.278
French breakfasts.

932
01:15:28.403 --> 01:15:32.658
I, on the other hand, always
habituate myself to local customs.


933
01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:34.660
So it was bacon and eggs for me.

934
01:15:57.849 --> 01:16:00.852
My idea had been
to take a little stroll,


935
01:16:01.186 --> 01:16:02.521
to show her Paris.

936
01:16:02.979 --> 01:16:04.356
As time went on,

937
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.858
I sensed we didn't want to separate.

938
01:16:06.983 --> 01:16:10.278
We didn't want just a little stroll.

939
01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:12.739
We wanted a much longer stroll.

940
01:16:33.093 --> 01:16:35.470
At one moment, 
I don't know why,

941
01:16:35.595 --> 01:16:38.181
I don't know how, this happened...

942
01:16:52.529 --> 01:16:53.739
I felt her hand say...

943
01:16:54.448 --> 01:16:57.951
"Really? Are you sure?"

944
01:16:58.201 --> 01:17:00.871
And my hand said,
"I'm sure.


945
01:17:01.288 --> 01:17:04.666
"I want to
and I sense you do, too."


946
01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:09.212
She squeezed my hand even tighter.
She wanted to.


947
01:17:10.088 --> 01:17:13.341
It's wild how strong
these stupid moments can be.


948
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:15.302
Those 12 seconds

949
01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:19.639
will be etched
deep inside you forever.


950
01:17:20.265 --> 01:17:23.226
In the movies,
most love stories end there.


951
01:17:23.393 --> 01:17:26.062
It's better
not to show what comes next.


952
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:28.815
But that's the interesting part.

953
01:17:29.274 --> 01:17:31.318
- Stay!
- Let me go!


954
01:17:31.485 --> 01:17:32.694
No! Stay!

955
01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:35.781
Let me go!

956
01:17:42.245 --> 01:17:43.914
What the fuck are you doing?

957
01:17:44.498 --> 01:17:45.791
Neus!

958
01:17:46.958 --> 01:17:48.293
Fuck you!

959
01:17:48.627 --> 01:17:50.921
Neus! I don't believe it!

960
01:17:51.129 --> 01:17:53.757
What are you doing? Come back!

961
01:17:56.718 --> 01:17:58.261
Where are you going?

962
01:18:24.955 --> 01:18:27.791
It was like we
had to go through that.

963
01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:32.379
Like going through all that wacky shit
reassured us somehow.


964
01:18:32.546 --> 01:18:34.339
It proved we were in love.

965
01:19:57.547 --> 01:20:01.509
You know, I feel a little weird
working with you.


966
01:20:01.718 --> 01:20:02.886
Why?

967
01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:06.765
Well, a month ago you were a stranger
and now...


968
01:20:07.766 --> 01:20:09.643
I tell you my life story...

969
01:20:09.809 --> 01:20:11.770
You're gonna write it.

970
01:20:12.812 --> 01:20:15.607
You've become my mirror.

971
01:20:16.232 --> 01:20:18.652
I hope you don't find me
too superficial.


972
01:20:18.818 --> 01:20:20.445
Not at all.

973
01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:24.950
You're a spoiled child
but you have a strong personality.


974
01:20:25.116 --> 01:20:26.284
You think so?

975
01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:29.829
You're a beautiful person.

976
01:20:47.681 --> 01:20:49.849
Your dream's about to come true.

977
01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.295
The next morning,
everything had changed.


978
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:21.965
Even my scooter wasn't the same.

979
01:28:32.895 --> 01:28:33.729
Get out!

980
01:28:44.031 --> 01:28:45.074
Get the fuck out!

981
01:29:52.725 --> 01:29:56.771
Wendy and I decided
to visit William in Saint Petersburg.


982
01:29:57.522 --> 01:30:00.942
Beginning a relationship
is like going on a trip.


983
01:30:01.817 --> 01:30:05.321
And going far away
can show how close you can be.


984
01:30:42.525 --> 01:30:46.571
William took us to the Komunolka
where he and Natasha lived.


985
01:30:46.737 --> 01:30:50.032
A communal apartment
occupied by several families.


986
01:30:56.455 --> 01:30:57.915
Hello.

987
01:30:58.082 --> 01:31:00.793
This is my sister Wendy. And Xavier.

988
01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.129
Please, come in.

989
01:31:08.551 --> 01:31:10.052
Come on, Natasha!

990
01:31:15.975 --> 01:31:18.311
This is my sister, Wendy.
Xavier.


991
01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:37.413
Oh! Hi!

992
01:31:38.164 --> 01:31:39.999
Can't you put some pants on?

993
01:31:41.542 --> 01:31:43.419
Oleg, this is my fiancé's family.

994
01:31:43.586 --> 01:31:45.504
You could make an effort.

995
01:31:46.005 --> 01:31:48.132
Well, tell your fiancé...

996
01:31:51.927 --> 01:31:54.430
Must you walk around in your skivvies?

997
01:31:54.764 --> 01:31:59.101
It's my house. If I feel like
wearing skivvies, I'll wear skivvies.


998
01:31:59.393 --> 01:32:00.978
With or without English people.

999
01:32:15.743 --> 01:32:19.080
Make them some tea.
And thanks a bunch, Oleg.


1000
01:32:19.246 --> 01:32:21.123
I love you, too, darling.

1001
01:33:28.023 --> 01:33:32.737
I'm sorry that you're seeing
the place like this.


1002
01:33:32.903 --> 01:33:37.450
Times are changing.
I'm about to buy the whole apartment.


1003
01:33:37.575 --> 01:33:40.119
It'll be great
when it's just for our family.


1004
01:33:41.704 --> 01:33:43.164
- Won't it?
- Sure.


1005
01:34:49.563 --> 01:34:52.775
This is
"the street of ideal proportions."


1006
01:34:52.942 --> 01:34:56.028
The height of the buildings
is equal to the width of the street.


1007
01:34:56.195 --> 01:34:58.447
And the length is 250 meters.

1008
01:36:21.155 --> 01:36:23.365
Moscow? You're in Moscow?

1009
01:36:24.158 --> 01:36:25.534
I don't know...

1010
01:36:26.035 --> 01:36:30.331
No! I didn't say that.
It's not far. Why not?


1011
01:36:30.539 --> 01:36:31.874
Two days?

1012
01:36:38.464 --> 01:36:42.217
I don't know if I can.
Of course I want to.


1013
01:36:43.761 --> 01:36:45.429
Yeah, great.

1014
01:39:41.605 --> 01:39:46.068
Any guy with a normal constitution
would have run after her.


1015
01:39:46.527 --> 01:39:48.070
Me, I didn't move.

1016
01:39:48.612 --> 01:39:50.906
Or, rather, it's the train that moved.

1017
01:39:51.406 --> 01:39:52.699
I just let it.

1018
01:41:35.802 --> 01:41:38.222
I'm happy to see you.

1019
01:41:38.597 --> 01:41:40.849
I was all alone in Moscow.

1020
01:41:41.016 --> 01:41:42.726
I was so bored.

1021
01:41:42.893 --> 01:41:45.729
Then I remembered
you were in Russia too.


1022
01:41:45.896 --> 01:41:48.857
I thought, "That's too dumb.
We've got to see each other!"


1023
01:41:49.524 --> 01:41:53.028
I'm so happy you came.
You're really a great guy.


1024
01:41:53.487 --> 01:41:54.363
Yes, you are.

1025
01:41:56.031 --> 01:41:57.199
1,500.

1026
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:14.883
She was just so beautiful.

1027
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:18.929
Celia is the stuff
that dreams are made of.


1028
01:42:20.138 --> 01:42:22.933
So beautiful, she's almost not real.

1029
01:42:28.272 --> 01:42:32.359
It'd be incredible to spend your life
with a woman like that.


1030
01:43:41.678 --> 01:43:42.804
Please!

1031
01:44:11.583 --> 01:44:12.667
Andrej!

1032
01:44:12.834 --> 01:44:14.503
Take out the champagne!

1033
01:45:01.091 --> 01:45:04.553
I felt the sub-woofer
calmly pounding away.


1034
01:45:05.053 --> 01:45:07.889
After all, that's what a boom box
is supposed to do.


1035
01:45:08.056 --> 01:45:09.224
That's what it does.

1036
01:45:14.729 --> 01:45:16.481
We must like that low tone.

1037
01:45:17.524 --> 01:45:19.234
We all want to vibrate.

1038
01:45:32.122 --> 01:45:35.750
Celia is the female equivalent
of "the street of ideal proportions."


1039
01:45:35.917 --> 01:45:40.922
We're not on earth long, so
that's the street we want to live on.


1040
01:45:59.441 --> 01:46:02.777
I could've spent hours,
gazing at a girl like that.


1041
01:46:06.156 --> 01:46:09.326
Just watching her live, walk,

1042
01:46:09.784 --> 01:46:12.621
lulled by the swing of her skirt,

1043
01:46:13.288 --> 01:46:16.958
inebriated by the fabric
sliding against her body.


1044
01:47:15.392 --> 01:47:18.728
I could have lived on that
an entire lifetime.


1045
01:47:19.688 --> 01:47:21.773
But can you live like that?

1046
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:29.197
They were right, I had to stop
dreaming and get back to real life.


1047
01:47:29.364 --> 01:47:30.740
Hey, bitch!

1048
01:47:31.241 --> 01:47:34.035
This street of yours...
Wanna know something?


1049
01:47:34.869 --> 01:47:36.371
It's ugly!

1050
01:48:36.765 --> 01:48:39.601
I've left Wendy three messages.

1051
01:48:40.602 --> 01:48:41.936
Why is she avoiding me?

1052
01:48:42.103 --> 01:48:45.982
Relax.
She'll call back sooner or later.


1053
01:48:46.274 --> 01:48:50.779
She's got her family,
her brother's wedding. She's busy.


1054
01:48:57.494 --> 01:48:58.411
Yeah, ma?

1055
01:48:59.746 --> 01:49:02.082
I know, you told me two days ago.

1056
01:49:02.832 --> 01:49:05.418
I've got another call.
I'll call you back.


1057
01:50:14.404 --> 01:50:16.197
What's all this shit about love?

1058
01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:18.366
How do we get so nuts?

1059
01:50:18.575 --> 01:50:20.744
The time we waste!

1060
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:24.289
When you're alone, you cry,
"Will I find her?" When you're not,


1061
01:50:24.414 --> 01:50:27.167
"Does she love me
as much as I love her?


1062
01:50:27.292 --> 01:50:30.628
"Can we love more than one person
in a lifetime?


1063
01:50:30.754 --> 01:50:32.380
"Why do we split up?"

1064
01:50:32.547 --> 01:50:35.133
All these fucking questions!

1065
01:50:35.258 --> 01:50:37.844
Yet you can't say we're uninformed.

1066
01:50:37.969 --> 01:50:41.347
We read love stories,
fairy tales, novels,


1067
01:50:41.473 --> 01:50:44.184
we watch movies. 
Love, love, love...

1068
01:50:51.608 --> 01:50:53.234
You could just call her back.

1069
01:51:49.874 --> 01:51:52.627
Dear William and Natalia,

1070
01:51:52.794 --> 01:51:54.128
I'm pleased

1071
01:51:54.796 --> 01:51:57.841
to welcome you
to our wedding palace.


1072
01:51:58.007 --> 01:52:00.134
Before registering your marriage,

1073
01:52:00.677 --> 01:52:02.595
I must ask

1074
01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:06.140
if your wish to marry

1075
01:52:06.307 --> 01:52:08.977
is mutual, sincere and free.

1076
01:52:09.853 --> 01:52:12.313
I ask the groom to respond.

1077
01:52:15.149 --> 01:52:16.818
I ask the bride.

1078
01:52:16.985 --> 01:52:18.194
Yes.

1079
01:52:20.071 --> 01:52:25.326
Still, this "till death do us part"
masquerade is pretty insane.


1080
01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:29.163
You can't help being moved.
You can't help believing it.


1081
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:33.376
"The most beautiful day of my life."
"For better or for worse..."


1082
01:52:54.981 --> 01:52:58.318
The photo album!
We'll have that for life.


1083
01:52:58.443 --> 01:52:59.694
It's a day to remember.

1084
01:53:00.361 --> 01:53:03.990
The tombstone of our love
that lives on for eternity.


1085
01:53:04.741 --> 01:53:07.493
It's awful,
even I can't swallow it anymore.


1086
01:54:44.799 --> 01:54:45.842
Gorko!

1087
01:54:58.855 --> 01:55:01.899
I wish you happiness, my children.

1088
01:55:24.505 --> 01:55:28.009
I raise my glass to William

1089
01:55:28.176 --> 01:55:31.345
and his new family.

1090
01:55:41.898 --> 01:55:43.191
Cheers!

1091
01:55:57.955 --> 01:56:00.750
I miss you so much in Barcelona.

1092
01:56:00.917 --> 01:56:02.627
I love you all.

1093
01:56:28.236 --> 01:56:29.403
Cheers!

1094
01:56:45.586 --> 01:56:47.588
Everybody, dance!

1095
01:56:48.214 --> 01:56:50.591
On your feet, everybody!

1096
01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:53.427
Let's light a fire under this party!

1097
01:57:02.145 --> 01:57:04.522
Do I look like the farandole type?

1098
01:57:04.647 --> 01:57:06.816
Who cares? It's Saint Pete's!

1099
01:57:09.610 --> 01:57:10.945
Come on!

1100
01:57:11.612 --> 01:57:14.157
What the fuck do you care? Come on!

1101
01:58:36.656 --> 01:58:37.698
You okay?

1102
01:59:36.632 --> 01:59:38.259
Why are you crying?

1103
01:59:42.596 --> 01:59:43.931
Are you okay?

1104
01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:01.282
Everything's fine.

1105
02:00:01.824 --> 02:00:03.409
What's the matter?

1106
02:00:30.186 --> 02:00:32.688
Voilà! That's me...

1107
02:00:32.855 --> 02:00:35.775
I'm almost thirty. Still alone.

1108
02:00:36.567 --> 02:00:39.862
Same damn face...
Can't change a thing.


1109
02:00:41.155 --> 02:00:43.657
Me. Screwed up old me.

1110
02:01:03.677 --> 02:01:05.805
No, that's too stupid.

1111
02:01:05.930 --> 02:01:07.681
Don't do that.

1112
02:02:45.529 --> 02:02:47.281
If I think about all the girls

1113
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:50.620
I've known
or slept with or just desired,


1114
02:02:51.575 --> 02:02:53.955
they're like a bunch of Russian dolls.

1115
02:02:54.995 --> 02:02:59.790
We spend our lives playing the game,
dying to know who'll be the last.


1116
02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:03.295
The teeny-tiny one,
hidden inside all the others.


1117
02:03:03.925 --> 02:03:08.010
You can't get to her right away.
You have to follow the progression.


1118
02:03:08.135 --> 02:03:12.850
You have to open them, one by one,
wondering, "Is she the last?"


1119
02:03:16.975 --> 02:03:18.645
Shit, I didn't finish!

1120
02:03:27.945 --> 02:03:30.490
Well, it's no big deal...

1121
02:03:31.410 --> 02:03:32.870
I'll finish the story later.

1122
02:04:01.690 --> 02:04:03.650
Wait, I'll help you.

1123
02:05:13.595 --> 02:05:14.930
I finished!

1124
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:17.095
Super bueno!
