1
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.191
- Who is it?
- Fantasia.


2
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.245
Hey, girl.

3
00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:35.582
- I thought you were going to Star City.
- I am tonight.


4
00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.997
You think you're bad with that camera.

5
00:02:38.127 --> 00:02:39.456
Come on.

6
00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:42.160
You're ruining the shot
with your lousy dancing.


7
00:02:42.297 --> 00:02:44.041
Bobby, look who's here.

8
00:02:46.093 --> 00:02:48.383
- How you doing?
- Fine.


9
00:02:48.555 --> 00:02:50.880
- Is Ray with you?
- No.


10
00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:53.970
- That's good.
- That's real good.


11
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.636
You know you're always welcome here.
You got here just in time.


12
00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:00.856
Bobby's about to blow out
the candles on his birthday cake.


13
00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:03.853
It's your birthday? 
How old are you, 60?

14
00:03:04.152 --> 00:03:05.812
That's your IQ, woman.

15
00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:11.490
This is Darren and Danielle.

16
00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:18.906
I left my purse in the car.
I'll be right back.


17
00:03:23.214 --> 00:03:25.336
What are you guys doing?

18
00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:28.503
Everybody get on the floor and be quiet.

19
00:03:28.634 --> 00:03:31.588
- What the fuck?
- Get on the floor, goddamn it!


20
00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:34.261
Let go, Ray.

21
00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:41.392
Down.

22
00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.803
Fantasia!

23
00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:46.349
Be quiet and everything will be okay.

24
00:03:55.995 --> 00:03:58.402
- Where does Marco live?
- I don't know.


25
00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.492
- I said, where does he live?
- I don't know.


26
00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:03.874
- Where, goddamn it?
- I don't know!


27
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:07.335
How do you get your shit?
Does it fly over here?


28
00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:11.006
- Ray, please.
- You don't know nothing about this.


29
00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:16.888
If we tell anybody where Marco lives,
he'll kill us.


30
00:04:17.015 --> 00:04:19.220
What do you think we're going to do?

31
00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:22.093
Tell me or I'll slap your head off.

32
00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:24.644
Leave us alone!

33
00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:27.139
You don't have to hit her like that.

34
00:04:28.525 --> 00:04:30.565
Tell him and everything will be okay.

35
00:04:30.694 --> 00:04:34.229
Jackie don't know where Marco's staying.
I deal with him, she don't.


36
00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:36.946
Leave her alone and I'll tell you.

37
00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:46.866
Who is it?

38
00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:48.538
It's Bobby, Marco.

39
00:04:48.962 --> 00:04:50.753
I've got to get something from you.

40
00:04:50.963 --> 00:04:53.716
- I told you not to come so late.
- Come on, man.


41
00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:56.418
I got to get something tonight.

42
00:05:00.516 --> 00:05:02.092
Come on in here, man.

43
00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:06.103
This is a pretty woman you got here.

44
00:05:06.437 --> 00:05:08.644
Look at those titties. I like those.

45
00:05:08.898 --> 00:05:10.772
Ray, what are you doing?

46
00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:13.272
- Hey, man!
- I want some of this.


47
00:05:13.444 --> 00:05:17.772
What you want is on that table.
I got $200 in my wallet. Take it.


48
00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:21.822
- I ain't fucking around.
- Take the money and the coke.


49
00:05:21.994 --> 00:05:24.199
- This is lighter fluid.
- You're sick.


50
00:05:25.122 --> 00:05:27.873
I'll fuck her up.
I don't want your little $200.


51
00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.621
Fuck you. I don't want your $200.

52
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:31.748
Stop it!

53
00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.370
- Then you got the money?
- Put it out!


54
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.419
- I'll light her up! Fuck you!
- Put it out!


55
00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:40.583
Fuck you!

56
00:05:42.722 --> 00:05:43.921
Motherfucker!

57
00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:09.664
Goddamn.

58
00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:12.162
Goddamn.

59
00:06:18.298 --> 00:06:19.329
Got it?

60
00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:10.238
They got a fucking kid.

61
00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:14.860
Goddamn it, you motherfucker.
Where's your goddamn kid?


62
00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.902
Where's your goddamn kid?

63
00:08:18.121 --> 00:08:21.207
Go look for the kid.
We can't leave him here.


64
00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.203
I've been all over the house.

65
00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.704
I don't give a shit! Go look for him.
He might be hiding.


66
00:09:58.177 --> 00:10:00.715
Mommy! Mommy!

67
00:10:01.138 --> 00:10:03.760
Honey, what's wrong? 
What is it, baby?

68
00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:06.100
It's okay, Daddy's here.

69
00:10:09.313 --> 00:10:10.855
She had a bad dream.

70
00:10:11.022 --> 00:10:14.474
You okay? I'll take her in our room.

71
00:10:16.486 --> 00:10:17.684
Are you okay?

72
00:10:20.324 --> 00:10:22.233
Dale, are you coming to bed?

73
00:10:22.451 --> 00:10:24.941
Yeah, I'll be right there.

74
00:11:38.648 --> 00:11:42.349
Good. Come on, Dud,
let's get to the wallets.


75
00:11:43.612 --> 00:11:45.651
Watch your feet.

76
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:47.275
I need a name.

77
00:11:49.492 --> 00:11:53.621
Let's do this body first.
I think this is our stranger.


78
00:12:01.212 --> 00:12:02.410
Who do we got?

79
00:12:05.175 --> 00:12:06.918
John, meet Robert Prost.

80
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.088
How do you do, Robert?

81
00:12:10.054 --> 00:12:11.382
Watch your feet.

82
00:12:16.852 --> 00:12:18.263
We're out of here.

83
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.204
- Isn't that a light in Robert's window?
- Yeah. At 10:00 in the morning.


84
00:13:29.465 --> 00:13:30.958
Shit!

85
00:13:31.217 --> 00:13:32.165
John!

86
00:13:36.263 --> 00:13:37.839
Anything on that tape?

87
00:13:38.264 --> 00:13:39.592
Some background voices.

88
00:13:39.723 --> 00:13:40.720
You?

89
00:13:41.393 --> 00:13:42.590
Nothing.

90
00:13:43.436 --> 00:13:45.559
How did you ID this Ray Malcolm?

91
00:13:45.813 --> 00:13:49.941
A neighbour recognised
Ray's car parked out front.


92
00:13:51.526 --> 00:13:53.070
Did they see him?

93
00:13:53.362 --> 00:13:57.906
She did see a black guy with glasses
come out, get in Ray's car and split.


94
00:13:59.953 --> 00:14:04.365
Didn't know Ray's last name. Said he was
staying with some dopers. We checked.


95
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:06.535
You separated it?

96
00:14:07.084 --> 00:14:09.788
Not yet. Is that Ray's package?

97
00:14:10.337 --> 00:14:11.996
So who's this black guy?

98
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.290
They call him Pluto.

99
00:14:14.632 --> 00:14:17.800
He's been hanging with Ray
the last couple of weeks.


100
00:14:18.386 --> 00:14:20.343
I'd say he's from out of town.

101
00:14:21.014 --> 00:14:23.090
Pluto? That's it?

102
00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:24.721
For now.

103
00:14:25.101 --> 00:14:26.346
Who's the girl?

104
00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:28.311
- Fantasia.
- Bullshit.


105
00:14:28.897 --> 00:14:30.854
Good-looking. Ray's old lady.

106
00:14:35.027 --> 00:14:36.225
Listen to this.

107
00:14:44.036 --> 00:14:48.579
Hey, girl. I thought you were going
to Star City tonight.


108
00:14:49.332 --> 00:14:51.241
Bobby, look who's here.

109
00:14:53.588 --> 00:14:56.706
Sounds like she said,
"I thought you're going to..." what?


110
00:14:56.882 --> 00:15:00.131
It sounds like,
"I thought you were going to Star City."


111
00:15:00.384 --> 00:15:03.470
Then the other girl says something.
Play it again.


112
00:15:11.896 --> 00:15:13.141
Hey, girl.

113
00:15:13.314 --> 00:15:16.350
- I thought you were going to Star City.
- I am tonight.


114
00:15:17.444 --> 00:15:20.480
It is Star City.
"I thought you were going to Star City."


115
00:15:21.572 --> 00:15:23.066
Dud, check this out.

116
00:15:23.408 --> 00:15:25.365
A robbery arrest from '79.

117
00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:29.403
In case of emergency, notify...

118
00:15:29.997 --> 00:15:32.702
"Jeremiah Malcolm. 
Relationship: Uncle.

119
00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:36.624
"Star City, Arkansas." I'll be damned.

120
00:15:38.922 --> 00:15:42.173
Jimmy, are you there?

121
00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:44.508
Yeah, Dale. Come on back.

122
00:15:45.053 --> 00:15:49.132
I went to the courthouse
and checked the records on Ray Malcolm.


123
00:15:49.849 --> 00:15:52.969
He was born here,
but hasn't lived here in 20 years.


124
00:15:53.354 --> 00:15:55.595
I'm heading to the uncle's place now.

125
00:15:55.772 --> 00:15:59.851
Do me a favour. Call Charlie,
tell him to come to work early tonight.


126
00:16:00.318 --> 00:16:03.189
I'm staying out there
in case those folks show up.


127
00:16:05.157 --> 00:16:07.777
If they do, we're going to be
laying for them.


128
00:16:10.328 --> 00:16:13.696
This could be a big one.
I'll talk to you later. 10-4.


129
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.738
10-4 and out.

130
00:16:19.753 --> 00:16:23.087
Just give their names,
Ray Malcolm and Pluto Franklin.


131
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.791
Give a description of the girl.
Say the victims were stabbed to death.


132
00:16:26.927 --> 00:16:28.422
How many stab wounds?

133
00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:31.592
Don't mention that.
Or the hog-tying and pillowcases.


134
00:16:31.723 --> 00:16:34.593
- And the other three?
- Say they were strangled.


135
00:16:35.018 --> 00:16:36.476
What about the kid?

136
00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:40.432
Don't mention the kid.
Just say there was a survivor.


137
00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:45.526
And that we think the suspects fled
the state. We might get national coverage.


138
00:16:48.656 --> 00:16:52.073
You got to give me something.
The press is all over my butt.


139
00:16:54.495 --> 00:16:57.947
- Say they're as violent as we've seen.
- Really?


140
00:16:59.458 --> 00:17:00.537
Thank you.

141
00:17:01.878 --> 00:17:04.749
What's the story on this Star City thing?

142
00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:09.633
Somebody, come on. Dud.

143
00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:12.376
Would it be a wild goose chase
if you went there?


144
00:17:12.512 --> 00:17:15.348
We've been lucky so far.
And we can tie Ray there.


145
00:17:16.058 --> 00:17:20.518
I talked to the police chief.
He didn't know of Ray or Fantasia...


146
00:17:20.729 --> 00:17:23.017
but he's gonna check the uncle out.

147
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.433
I'm waiting for his call.

148
00:17:27.653 --> 00:17:30.772
What about an ID on the second suspect?

149
00:17:31.573 --> 00:17:34.193
Pluto. His real name is Lenny Franklin.

150
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.990
He's originally from Chicago.

151
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:40.281
He and Ray got busted
about six years ago...


152
00:17:40.499 --> 00:17:43.416
for another drug rip off. Same shit.

153
00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:47.084
They did two years together
in San Quentin.


154
00:17:47.672 --> 00:17:48.951
Prison buddies.

155
00:17:49.089 --> 00:17:50.465
Pluto's a piece of work.

156
00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:53.421
IQ of 150 and a college graduate.

157
00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:56.212
We think he did the stabbings.

158
00:17:56.514 --> 00:18:00.213
His package indicates
he's very fond of a knife.


159
00:18:00.392 --> 00:18:01.969
He has three priors.

160
00:18:02.561 --> 00:18:05.397
For some reason,
he left the videotape playing.


161
00:18:06.023 --> 00:18:07.517
Sick son of a bitch.

162
00:18:08.483 --> 00:18:11.354
There were no prints,
so he left a calling card.


163
00:18:11.487 --> 00:18:12.565
He's here.

164
00:18:17.409 --> 00:18:18.689
Cole here.

165
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.988
Put him through.

166
00:18:22.206 --> 00:18:23.947
Chief Dixon, this is Dud...

167
00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:26.875
I'm fine, thank...

168
00:18:27.294 --> 00:18:31.292
Put him on the box.
What did you say his name was?


169
00:18:31.672 --> 00:18:35.420
Chief Dale Dixon. Chief,
I'm putting you on the speaker phone.


170
00:18:38.888 --> 00:18:40.465
Chief Jenkins is here.

171
00:18:41.973 --> 00:18:44.263
Los Angeles Chief of Police, Jenkins?

172
00:18:44.518 --> 00:18:46.974
No shit. It's a pleasure to meet you.

173
00:18:47.187 --> 00:18:48.562
Good to meet you.

174
00:18:50.023 --> 00:18:53.939
- Now what we want to talk about...
- Guess you're pretty busy out there.


175
00:18:55.946 --> 00:18:57.227
- Sure.
- I'll bet.


176
00:18:57.364 --> 00:18:59.902
You got six people dead out there
at the same time.


177
00:19:00.033 --> 00:19:01.693
That don't happen much here.

178
00:19:01.825 --> 00:19:04.864
Sometimes we get a stabbing.
Colored boys, generally.


179
00:19:05.997 --> 00:19:07.455
Every other Saturday night...

180
00:19:07.582 --> 00:19:10.499
one of them sticks another one
over a card game.


181
00:19:12.086 --> 00:19:15.621
- We should discuss the...
- Craps sometimes.


182
00:19:16.132 --> 00:19:20.379
Now you wanted to know about this
boy's uncle. I think we hit the jackpot.


183
00:19:21.387 --> 00:19:25.514
I went to the uncle's place.
It's the damnedest hideout I've ever seen.


184
00:19:26.058 --> 00:19:28.811
It's in the woods,
about six miles northeast of town.


185
00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:31.557
The only way there is over an old,
rickety bridge.


186
00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:35.057
You'd never find it
if you didn't know where to look.


187
00:19:35.234 --> 00:19:38.686
You city boys would
be lost in ten minutes.

188
00:19:39.196 --> 00:19:41.354
But I'm ready, don't worry.

189
00:19:41.573 --> 00:19:42.605
Damn, Bonnie.

190
00:19:42.741 --> 00:19:44.319
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.


191
00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:47.986
They were out of onion rings,
so I got you Tasty Taters.


192
00:19:48.663 --> 00:19:51.119
It's L.A., Cheryl Ann, and Chief Jenkins.

193
00:19:54.252 --> 00:19:55.248
Yes, sir.

194
00:19:55.587 --> 00:19:58.457
So you think this is a promising avenue
of investigation?


195
00:19:58.589 --> 00:20:03.585
It's promising all right. Me and
my deputies can set up a surveillance now.


196
00:20:04.178 --> 00:20:08.508
Chief Dixon, why don't we hold off on that
until we get a game plan.


197
00:20:09.058 --> 00:20:10.256
If you say so.

198
00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:13.561
That would be best.

199
00:20:14.564 --> 00:20:18.513
It's my job. We'll get the sons of bitches.
I'll be waiting on you.


200
00:20:55.145 --> 00:20:58.429
What are you two doing here?
When did you get back?


201
00:20:58.605 --> 00:21:01.143
- Wednesday night.
- Wednesday night?


202
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.318
That's no honeymoon.
You should have stayed longer.


203
00:21:04.862 --> 00:21:08.562
Earl had to get back to work
and I'm starting a new job next week.


204
00:21:08.699 --> 00:21:10.323
What are you going to be doing?

205
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:13.404
Bookkeeping at the Rice Mill.
Muriel retired...


206
00:21:13.537 --> 00:21:17.452
so I talked to Old Man Hosey
and he hired me.


207
00:21:17.874 --> 00:21:19.535
Take it easy.

208
00:21:21.962 --> 00:21:22.958
Dale?

209
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.499
Well, that's good. 
Congratulations.

210
00:21:28.009 --> 00:21:30.678
- Thank you, Dale.
- We better be going.


211
00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.915
You want some of this?

212
00:22:06.004 --> 00:22:08.127
Why don't you put some clothes on?

213
00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:18.721
I told you to put some clothes on.

214
00:22:21.936 --> 00:22:23.727
Ray, those people are dead.

215
00:22:25.607 --> 00:22:27.231
Those people are dead.

216
00:22:28.819 --> 00:22:29.814
No shit.

217
00:22:31.737 --> 00:22:33.196
And you were there.

218
00:22:34.114 --> 00:22:35.526
Don't forget that.

219
00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:41.370
Didn't I tell you
to put some goddamn clothes on?


220
00:22:56.218 --> 00:22:59.136
We got enough of this shit
to last us until 1995.


221
00:22:59.889 --> 00:23:02.844
We got enough to last
until we get to Houston.


222
00:23:03.727 --> 00:23:05.766
We're not selling all this shit.

223
00:23:06.061 --> 00:23:08.351
We're selling it to Billy in Houston.

224
00:23:08.689 --> 00:23:11.939
I'm going back to Chicago.
I don't give a fuck what you do.


225
00:23:12.778 --> 00:23:15.399
Riding up and down the road
don't make sense.


226
00:23:15.863 --> 00:23:19.066
What do you think will happen?
Are we going to get in trouble?


227
00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:23.407
I was planning to sell some to
them country sons of bitches in Arkansas.


228
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:27.077
Man, I don't like this Arkansas shit.

229
00:23:28.209 --> 00:23:30.331
We'll be in and out. Don't worry.

230
00:23:30.919 --> 00:23:32.662
We're not building a house.

231
00:23:32.796 --> 00:23:35.750
It's not a problem.
What are you worried about?


232
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.011
What the fuck do you think?

233
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.968
I don't get you.

234
00:23:48.186 --> 00:23:50.677
Why don't you loosen up
and have some fun?


235
00:23:52.441 --> 00:23:54.812
Why don't you get
high with Ray and me?

236
00:23:56.527 --> 00:23:58.401
Don't you want to feel good?

237
00:24:07.997 --> 00:24:10.997
This is the biggest thing
that ever happened to us.


238
00:24:11.458 --> 00:24:14.246
And you're just sitting there
like a little brown turd.


239
00:24:16.422 --> 00:24:17.501
Goddamn it!

240
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:19.125
Watch yourself, Ray.

241
00:24:20.633 --> 00:24:23.669
Listen up, motherfucker. Listen up!

242
00:24:24.722 --> 00:24:29.182
This is what will happen.
We will go to Houston and sell the shit...


243
00:24:29.727 --> 00:24:32.561
because this little $15,000 won't last.

244
00:24:32.854 --> 00:24:36.769
Until then, I will hold onto the blow.

245
00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.987
And Ray, I don't want to hear
any more bullshit out of you...


246
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.645
or her.

247
00:24:56.627 --> 00:24:58.085
You son of a bitch!

248
00:24:59.588 --> 00:25:01.248
Fucking son of a bitch!

249
00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:06.173
Why don't you just go to sleep, fucker?

250
00:25:08.263 --> 00:25:10.754
You forgot just one fucking thing.

251
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.184
You forgot about the money.
I have all the goddamn money.


252
00:25:16.229 --> 00:25:18.351
You keep that little $15,000, Ray.

253
00:25:20.692 --> 00:25:22.066
He's right, baby.

254
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:25.901
We should sell the stuff in Houston.
Think of all the money.


255
00:25:27.615 --> 00:25:31.908
We'll be okay.
Pluto knows people in Chicago.


256
00:25:32.453 --> 00:25:35.026
We can live off that
money for a long time.

257
00:25:36.333 --> 00:25:38.621
Come on, baby, it's going to be okay.

258
00:25:40.961 --> 00:25:43.831
We can buy all the blow we want
when we get there.


259
00:25:45.173 --> 00:25:46.585
We'll be safe.

260
00:25:47.551 --> 00:25:49.343
Pluto will take care of us.

261
00:25:50.638 --> 00:25:52.131
We'll be safe, baby.

262
00:26:31.177 --> 00:26:32.884
This is really beautiful.

263
00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:34.969
It's as green as hell.

264
00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.931
You know I'm a country boy.

265
00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:40.265
That's crap. You were born in L.A.

266
00:26:41.478 --> 00:26:42.474
Malibu.

267
00:26:50.863 --> 00:26:52.653
What the fuck?

268
00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:02.786
Howdy.

269
00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:10.046
Welcome to Star City. We've got
a full day, so follow me to the motel...


270
00:27:10.464 --> 00:27:13.335
you can unpack
and we'll get something to eat.


271
00:27:13.635 --> 00:27:17.501
When I saw you drive by,
I knew you were the boys from California.


272
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.551
Cops look the same everywhere, I guess.

273
00:27:22.183 --> 00:27:23.264
Follow me.

274
00:27:28.649 --> 00:27:29.763
Oh, shit.

275
00:27:48.168 --> 00:27:50.041
You boys are in for a treat.

276
00:27:51.671 --> 00:27:53.877
Fern, can we get some more biscuits?

277
00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:56.960
- Sure, Hurricane.
- And more coffee.


278
00:27:57.552 --> 00:27:58.631
Hurricane?

279
00:27:58.803 --> 00:28:01.638
Some folks call me that.
I never figured out why.


280
00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:08.353
We can wait in the woods.
When the bad folks show up...


281
00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:11.555
we'll put the stopper in the bottle.

282
00:28:11.691 --> 00:28:14.145
They'll be sorry they ever heard
of Star City.


283
00:28:14.277 --> 00:28:15.439
This is good.

284
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.027
My mother used to make food like this.

285
00:28:19.155 --> 00:28:20.863
Thanks. How's Walter?

286
00:28:21.158 --> 00:28:23.115
He had gallbladder surgery.

287
00:28:23.328 --> 00:28:26.695
Good for him. I'll be giving you boys
my full cooperation.


288
00:28:27.498 --> 00:28:29.205
Me and my two deputies...

289
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.241
will take turns watching the place
around the clock.


290
00:28:34.002 --> 00:28:38.795
So you boys can just relax, drink beer,
chase chicks, and whatever.


291
00:28:39.092 --> 00:28:40.585
We'll help.

292
00:28:40.884 --> 00:28:42.877
- We'll help you.
- Suit yourself.


293
00:28:44.347 --> 00:28:46.469
Another thing. 
Old Man Malcolm...

294
00:28:47.184 --> 00:28:50.801
I guarantee he don't know jack-shit
about what his nephew did.


295
00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:54.391
Did you talk to him?

296
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.854
Not yet. I just know. There aren't even
any telephone lines up there.


297
00:29:00.446 --> 00:29:03.151
He's a hermit.
Hardly ever leaves his property.


298
00:29:03.949 --> 00:29:06.440
I think we ought to talk to him
and let him know.


299
00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:09.904
- That may be the case, but...
- Charlie! Get on in here.


300
00:29:10.288 --> 00:29:12.827
This is my deputy. 
Retired police officer.

301
00:29:13.374 --> 00:29:15.118
Charlie, this is Dud Cole.

302
00:29:16.544 --> 00:29:19.000
And this is Dan Macintosh.

303
00:29:19.214 --> 00:29:21.005
John. John McFeely.

304
00:29:21.465 --> 00:29:25.334
Oh, right. All them Mac names
sound alike to me.


305
00:29:25.971 --> 00:29:28.722
- You eaten, Charlie?
- Yeah, Jocelyn fixed me...


306
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.929
Charlie's a Yankee from Detroit.

307
00:29:31.642 --> 00:29:35.260
Dale, if we talk to this guy
and he's involved...


308
00:29:35.438 --> 00:29:38.772
- I told you he's not.
- Hurricane. I mean, Dale.


309
00:29:39.358 --> 00:29:41.149
These are dangerous people.

310
00:29:41.443 --> 00:29:42.854
I understand that.

311
00:29:46.658 --> 00:29:47.856
You boys about ready?

312
00:29:47.992 --> 00:29:49.190
Just a second.

313
00:29:49.577 --> 00:29:50.691
Here, Fern.

314
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:52.489
Keep the change.

315
00:29:52.788 --> 00:29:55.623
There is no change, Hurricane.
It's a $12 check...


316
00:29:55.749 --> 00:29:57.658
and you gave me a ten!

317
00:29:57.793 --> 00:29:59.121
Catch you later.

318
00:29:59.503 --> 00:30:00.997
Is he gone?

319
00:30:01.213 --> 00:30:04.462
I haven't had a full meal
since I met the son of a bitch.


320
00:30:05.592 --> 00:30:07.050
Go ahead, Jimmy.

321
00:30:07.177 --> 00:30:10.463
It's Harlan Childress. Lureen called.
He's raising hell.


322
00:30:11.056 --> 00:30:15.005
I'm on a case here. Unless he's trying
to kill her, I don't have time.


323
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.475
She said he's trying to kill her.

324
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:20.228
I'm just letting you know.

325
00:30:20.523 --> 00:30:21.767
Okay, 10-4.

326
00:30:22.108 --> 00:30:25.891
Hop in. We have to make a little stop
before we go to the Malcolm place.


327
00:30:39.916 --> 00:30:41.161
Open this door!

328
00:30:41.335 --> 00:30:42.876
Goddamn it! Lureen!

329
00:30:45.296 --> 00:30:47.088
Harlan! Goddamn it.

330
00:30:51.261 --> 00:30:54.879
- Settle down, Harlan!
- Let go!


331
00:30:57.142 --> 00:30:58.601
Harlan, goddamn it!

332
00:31:03.314 --> 00:31:06.066
You calm down now. Calm down.

333
00:31:06.484 --> 00:31:08.642
Do you want to
take a ride with me?

334
00:31:11.489 --> 00:31:14.111
- Settle down.
- He was out all night drinking.


335
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:17.569
Who are those men?

336
00:31:17.995 --> 00:31:19.193
It's okay.

337
00:31:19.913 --> 00:31:21.906
She locked me out of the kitchen.

338
00:31:22.041 --> 00:31:23.500
I understand.

339
00:31:28.213 --> 00:31:29.921
You were out all night drinking.

340
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:32.717
You knew she was going to do this,
didn't you?


341
00:31:35.053 --> 00:31:37.342
If you apologise, she may let you in.

342
00:31:37.472 --> 00:31:38.883
He knows I will.

343
00:31:39.724 --> 00:31:41.966
We'll go to church, he'll feel better.

344
00:31:42.102 --> 00:31:43.512
All right, Lureen.

345
00:31:45.397 --> 00:31:49.311
- You won't let them take him away?
- They're with me. They're from L.A.


346
00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:53.111
Get up. Pull yourself together, okay?
Come on.


347
00:31:54.154 --> 00:31:56.194
Come on. Get up.

348
00:31:59.076 --> 00:32:00.701
Now come here.

349
00:32:01.037 --> 00:32:04.405
Do me a favour.
Put this axe back in the shed.


350
00:32:04.623 --> 00:32:05.654
All right?

351
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:10.666
I don't want to have to come back
out here. Are you okay?


352
00:32:10.838 --> 00:32:12.166
I'm okay.

353
00:32:13.924 --> 00:32:17.423
Put that axe in the shed.
And fix this window.


354
00:32:17.844 --> 00:32:20.928
- Tell Cheryl Ann and the baby I said hi.
- Tell them hi.


355
00:32:22.516 --> 00:32:24.804
- Sorry about the window.
- That's okay.


356
00:32:28.438 --> 00:32:31.972
It's okay, boys. 
I'm out here twice a week.

357
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:04.925
Motherfucker!

358
00:33:07.392 --> 00:33:11.260
Goddamn it! They know me now.
Are you aware of that, bitch?


359
00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:15.436
They know my face, my name,
probably how long my dick is!


360
00:33:16.484 --> 00:33:20.482
A goddamn kid! Why didn't you tell me
about that fucking kid?


361
00:33:20.613 --> 00:33:23.187
I swear to God, 
I didn't see any kid!

362
00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:25.901
He must have been hiding.

363
00:33:26.286 --> 00:33:27.365
Quit lying!

364
00:33:27.912 --> 00:33:32.039
Don't hit me no more.
Pluto, don't let him hit me no more.


365
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.578
Get rid of her, Ray.

366
00:33:35.586 --> 00:33:36.961
We'll be okay.

367
00:33:37.088 --> 00:33:40.421
- Shut up.
- We'll dump the car. They won't find us.


368
00:33:40.548 --> 00:33:42.292
They won't find you maybe!

369
00:33:42.426 --> 00:33:44.169
They won't find us!

370
00:33:44.469 --> 00:33:47.257
- It'll be okay.
- Get your hand off of me.


371
00:33:47.598 --> 00:33:49.175
We'll be okay.

372
00:33:59.567 --> 00:34:01.477
Isn't there another way, Dale?

373
00:34:01.611 --> 00:34:04.184
Watch your step. 
The timbers are rotten.

374
00:34:04.614 --> 00:34:06.405
Yeah, rotten.

375
00:34:07.324 --> 00:34:10.776
I crashed my motorcycle
on this bridge when I was 14.


376
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.199
The volunteer fire department
had to put it out.


377
00:34:15.499 --> 00:34:18.869
You can still see
some of the burn marks.

378
00:34:28.178 --> 00:34:29.341
Perfect hideout.

379
00:34:29.471 --> 00:34:30.966
- Is the old man there?
- Yeah.


380
00:34:31.098 --> 00:34:33.768
- I wonder who else is there.
- He's by himself.


381
00:34:33.892 --> 00:34:35.516
Dale, wait a minute.

382
00:34:36.145 --> 00:34:37.805
It's okay, boys. Come on.

383
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.499
How you doing?

384
00:34:59.876 --> 00:35:01.074
You okay?

385
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.251
- I said, "You okay?"
- I'm doing okay.


386
00:35:03.378 --> 00:35:04.660
That's good.

387
00:35:04.964 --> 00:35:06.422
I'm Chief Dixon.

388
00:35:07.299 --> 00:35:08.877
I'm fixing to do what?

389
00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:10.339
I'm Chief Dixon.

390
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.968
I'm fixing to feed the chickens
before it gets too damn hot.


391
00:35:19.728 --> 00:35:21.686
Have you heard from your nephew lately?

392
00:35:21.898 --> 00:35:23.936
Have you heard from Ray Malcolm?

393
00:35:24.274 --> 00:35:26.895
He's my brother's boy.
I heard of my own kin.


394
00:35:27.027 --> 00:35:30.692
Has he talked to you lately?
When was the last time you talked to him?


395
00:35:30.821 --> 00:35:32.898
- Talked to who?
- Ray Malcolm.


396
00:35:33.158 --> 00:35:35.114
Ray is my brother's boy.

397
00:35:35.243 --> 00:35:39.572
I got to finish feeding these chickens.
It gets hot around here at noontime.


398
00:35:41.123 --> 00:35:44.245
I hope you and them chickens
have a goddamn heatstroke.


399
00:36:05.772 --> 00:36:07.314
Can I help you boys?

400
00:36:24.457 --> 00:36:27.244
"I'm fixing to feed these chickens."

401
00:36:27.793 --> 00:36:31.922
I say, "Have you heard from Ray Malcolm?"
Put that on Daddy's plate, sweetheart.


402
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.755
He says, "Ray Malcolm is my nephew."

403
00:36:36.052 --> 00:36:38.922
"My brother's boy.
I guess I heard of my own kin."


404
00:36:41.182 --> 00:36:43.755
So I said, "Have you spoken to him?"
He said, "Who?"


405
00:36:43.894 --> 00:36:47.096
I said, "Ray Malcolm."
He said, "Ray's my brother's boy."


406
00:36:47.396 --> 00:36:50.350
Imagine the conversation
when Ray shows up.


407
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:53.271
Rolls?

408
00:36:54.153 --> 00:36:55.528
Is this great or what?

409
00:36:55.654 --> 00:36:57.646
This is great, Cheryl Ann.

410
00:37:02.828 --> 00:37:04.026
There you go.

411
00:37:05.038 --> 00:37:08.787
I hope he does show up.
'Cause I got news for you.


412
00:37:09.167 --> 00:37:11.705
That white trash and
those two niggers are in for...


413
00:37:12.378 --> 00:37:15.296
Cheryl Ann, you nearly broke my...

414
00:37:19.637 --> 00:37:22.091
Bonnie, pass me the pickles.

415
00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.511
I never got any beans. 
May I have some?

416
00:37:42.157 --> 00:37:45.112
Did you think I
was going to cut you?

417
00:37:46.828 --> 00:37:49.498
I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world.


418
00:37:58.631 --> 00:38:01.419
I'm glad you didn't kill that man
in the car lot.


419
00:38:04.094 --> 00:38:05.803
What do you think we are?

420
00:38:28.743 --> 00:38:30.487
That don't mean nothing, Dale.

421
00:38:30.621 --> 00:38:35.828
What concerns me is that we left ourselves
so goddamn exposed.


422
00:38:36.334 --> 00:38:37.876
So out there.

423
00:38:38.462 --> 00:38:40.584
Anybody could tell
the man wasn't involved.


424
00:38:40.713 --> 00:38:45.541
You can't assume anything about anybody.
That's the guy who will fuck you.


425
00:38:46.053 --> 00:38:49.302
Shit. I've been police chief here for...

426
00:38:50.347 --> 00:38:53.384
hell, going on six years.

427
00:38:54.644 --> 00:38:56.850
I've never even had to draw my gun.

428
00:39:09.658 --> 00:39:12.280
Come kiss your favourite mommy.

429
00:39:13.495 --> 00:39:15.120
Get in the bed.

430
00:39:16.081 --> 00:39:17.539
Get in there.

431
00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.324
- See you in the morning.
- Goodnight, Mommy.


432
00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:47.478
Enjoying yourself?
Getting enough to eat and drink?


433
00:39:47.612 --> 00:39:49.236
Just about.

434
00:39:50.405 --> 00:39:52.481
Isn't that your second bottle?

435
00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:54.774
Yes, it is.

436
00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:58.914
I want to apologise
for that last comment before.


437
00:39:59.414 --> 00:40:01.158
I bet John feels terrible.

438
00:40:01.959 --> 00:40:05.043
Dale didn't mean it.
He just grew up talking that way.


439
00:40:05.294 --> 00:40:07.004
I understand.

440
00:40:07.965 --> 00:40:09.589
I'm sure John does, too.

441
00:40:10.467 --> 00:40:12.874
These people are dangerous, aren't they?

442
00:40:16.597 --> 00:40:17.795
Yes, they are.

443
00:40:18.099 --> 00:40:20.673
I've never seen Dale this excited before.

444
00:40:22.061 --> 00:40:25.845
This case is the biggest thing
that's ever happened to him.


445
00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:31.440
He really likes you
and John. I can tell.

446
00:40:32.489 --> 00:40:35.109
I think he looks
at you like you're heroes.

447
00:40:36.492 --> 00:40:39.196
Well, we're far from that.

448
00:40:39.953 --> 00:40:42.705
You might want to tell him that.

449
00:40:45.083 --> 00:40:47.575
I have a little
girl who needs her daddy.

450
00:40:48.169 --> 00:40:52.381
Dale doesn't know any better.
He watches TV. I read non-fiction.


451
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.653
We better head back.

452
00:41:21.911 --> 00:41:25.197
No, come on guys, the night is young.

453
00:41:25.957 --> 00:41:27.865
- Who wants cookies?
- We all do.


454
00:41:30.086 --> 00:41:32.837
- Very serious meal.
- They're in here.


455
00:41:33.797 --> 00:41:36.204
- I got to go pee.
- Pee off the porch.


456
00:41:36.842 --> 00:41:38.171
Like shit.

457
00:41:45.267 --> 00:41:46.642
You know, Dale...

458
00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:50.393
this case is our problem.

459
00:41:53.984 --> 00:41:56.772
What I'm saying is,
you can be as involved or...


460
00:41:56.987 --> 00:42:01.115
uninvolved in the apprehension
of these guys as we want.


461
00:42:02.742 --> 00:42:04.236
Assuming they show up.

462
00:42:04.367 --> 00:42:06.611
If they do, I'll be there.

463
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.500
You got a nice spot here.

464
00:42:19.425 --> 00:42:21.085
Nice house, nice family.

465
00:42:22.469 --> 00:42:23.928
You're a lucky guy.

466
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:27.506
I guess I am
a lucky guy at that.

467
00:42:29.143 --> 00:42:31.135
I hardly ever lose a coin toss.

468
00:42:34.481 --> 00:42:38.064
I go to the horse races,
bet a long shot and it always comes in.


469
00:42:38.985 --> 00:42:41.856
My mama used to say
I was born under a lucky star.


470
00:42:57.836 --> 00:43:01.086
Here's an article about Julia
from Dark Memories.


471
00:43:02.883 --> 00:43:05.588
That ain't Julia.
That's that damn twin sister.


472
00:43:07.346 --> 00:43:08.544
No, it's not.

473
00:43:08.806 --> 00:43:10.963
Ma'am, can you tell him who this is?

474
00:43:11.266 --> 00:43:13.425
That's Julia on Dark Memories.

475
00:43:14.603 --> 00:43:17.176
I told you. You
got any maps of Houston?

476
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.729
We don't need no map of Houston.

477
00:43:58.437 --> 00:43:59.847
Be cool.

478
00:44:02.607 --> 00:44:04.018
How are you, Bill?

479
00:44:04.401 --> 00:44:06.393
It's real quiet out there.

480
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.695
I think we got
the two most exciting jobs in town.


481
00:44:13.576 --> 00:44:15.449
Your other burrito is ready.

482
00:44:17.039 --> 00:44:19.493
He's watching me. 
He knows who I am.

483
00:44:19.916 --> 00:44:22.407
- No, he doesn't.
- He does.


484
00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:24.956
Baby, let's go.

485
00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:27.376
Back up. Just back up.

486
00:44:29.717 --> 00:44:31.709
Ray, stop it. Stop it.

487
00:44:32.846 --> 00:44:33.877
Shit.

488
00:44:45.024 --> 00:44:46.897
I'd never get up on a horse.

489
00:44:48.068 --> 00:44:50.439
- Get your hand off me.
- Let's go.


490
00:44:53.532 --> 00:44:54.731
Let's go, okay?

491
00:44:55.367 --> 00:44:56.826
Don't fuck up, man.

492
00:45:15.677 --> 00:45:17.588
- Will that be all?
- That's it.


493
00:45:17.847 --> 00:45:20.089
Hope you don't mind
that we opened things up.


494
00:45:20.224 --> 00:45:21.968
As long as you pay for it.

495
00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:26.599
You going to drink that beer and drive?

496
00:45:26.897 --> 00:45:29.436
No, we wouldn't do that. 
This is for later.

497
00:45:31.068 --> 00:45:32.397
Just kidding.

498
00:45:33.028 --> 00:45:34.523
$7.95, please.

499
00:45:53.299 --> 00:45:55.421
- Have a nice night.
- You, too.


500
00:46:03.725 --> 00:46:05.634
She's too young for you, Bill.

501
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.013
I like them young.

502
00:46:26.704 --> 00:46:28.828
Shit! That trooper is behind us.

503
00:46:30.125 --> 00:46:31.323
Don't look back.

504
00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.739
Just be cool.

505
00:46:33.294 --> 00:46:35.003
What if he pulls us over?

506
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.624
He won't.

507
00:46:44.848 --> 00:46:48.050
Slow down, Ray. Don't panic.

508
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:51.060
He recognised me back there. I know it.

509
00:46:51.186 --> 00:46:53.939
If he had, he would have arrested you
in the store.


510
00:46:54.606 --> 00:46:56.350
He's just looking us over.

511
00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:00.599
A white boy and a nigger girl in Texas.
That's all it is.


512
00:47:01.947 --> 00:47:03.987
He's probably running our plates.

513
00:47:04.116 --> 00:47:05.527
542.

514
00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:08.493
Go ahead.

515
00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:14.411
On your out-of-state plate, New Mexico
license number Nora-Edward-2-4-5...


516
00:47:14.793 --> 00:47:17.035
the vehicle is recently purchased.

517
00:47:17.337 --> 00:47:21.086
There are no warrants.
No current registration available.


518
00:47:21.341 --> 00:47:25.588
10-4. Could you check the teletype board
for the past few days?


519
00:47:26.511 --> 00:47:29.882
I seem to recall a
teletype from California...


520
00:47:30.099 --> 00:47:32.851
of a male and female black...

521
00:47:32.977 --> 00:47:36.061
and a male white,
wanted for a couple of murders.


522
00:47:37.565 --> 00:47:40.317
Speed up, Ray.
You'll make him suspicious.


523
00:47:40.485 --> 00:47:43.236
Speed up, slow down.
Make up your fucking mind.


524
00:47:44.489 --> 00:47:46.446
Did you find that teletype?

525
00:47:47.073 --> 00:47:48.901
Still looking, 542.

526
00:47:49.785 --> 00:47:51.066
10-4.

527
00:47:59.795 --> 00:48:00.874
542.

528
00:48:01.837 --> 00:48:03.748
I'm going to pull them over.

529
00:48:06.218 --> 00:48:07.213
Fuck!

530
00:48:07.344 --> 00:48:08.542
What do we do?

531
00:48:09.763 --> 00:48:12.514
- I'll blow his goddamn head off.
- Pull over.


532
00:48:13.224 --> 00:48:17.222
We're going to be cool
and play it by ear.

533
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.890
We won't kill him unless we have to.

534
00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:24.395
We're not going to be stupid.

535
00:49:13.032 --> 00:49:15.155
Could I see your license and registration?

536
00:49:15.451 --> 00:49:16.910
Hi, it's you again.

537
00:49:34.011 --> 00:49:38.138
You have a California license
and New Mexico plates and registration.


538
00:49:38.974 --> 00:49:40.683
We had California plates...

539
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:44.095
but our car broke down in New Mexico
and we got a new one.


540
00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:46.680
Told you we wouldn't make it.

541
00:49:47.314 --> 00:49:49.023
He wouldn't listen to me.

542
00:49:49.399 --> 00:49:50.979
This one will make it.

543
00:49:51.111 --> 00:49:52.309
Make it where?

544
00:49:52.779 --> 00:49:56.194
Philadelphia. My mother lives there.
She's sick.


545
00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:59.491
Ray's my boyfriend,
so he got the job of taking me there.


546
00:50:00.327 --> 00:50:04.077
Richard's our friend.
He's just along for the ride.


547
00:50:06.208 --> 00:50:08.165
Were we speeding or something?

548
00:50:08.335 --> 00:50:09.366
No, ma'am.

549
00:50:09.587 --> 00:50:11.959
Then why the fuck
did you pull us over?

550
00:50:15.009 --> 00:50:17.844
I want you to get out of the car,
one at a time.


551
00:50:18.846 --> 00:50:20.220
You first, ma'am.

552
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:23.719
Get your hands up!

553
00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:27.302
Calm down. You said, "Get out.
You first, man," right?


554
00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:31.104
Step to the rear of the car
and keep your hands visible.


555
00:50:34.778 --> 00:50:37.482
You said, "Get out of the car,"
that's all I'm doing.


556
00:50:38.365 --> 00:50:39.942
What's wrong with you?

557
00:50:40.241 --> 00:50:41.522
Do what he says.

558
00:50:41.659 --> 00:50:45.110
Stay where you are, ma'am.
Put your hands on the car.


559
00:50:46.289 --> 00:50:47.617
Spread them out.

560
00:50:47.956 --> 00:50:49.499
Now spread your legs.

561
00:50:52.379 --> 00:50:54.288
Same thing, hands on the car.

562
00:50:55.839 --> 00:50:57.215
Spread your legs.

563
00:50:58.467 --> 00:51:00.126
Okay, ma'am, come back here.

564
00:51:00.343 --> 00:51:04.342
- Why don't you tell us what we did...
- Keep your hands on the car!


565
00:51:09.936 --> 00:51:11.217
Okay, ma'am...

566
00:51:13.816 --> 00:51:17.315
Goddamn! Yes, baby! Yes!
You motherfucker!


567
00:51:17.444 --> 00:51:20.978
Let's go! Get her in the car.
Come on! Now!


568
00:51:21.489 --> 00:51:22.863
You motherfucker!

569
00:51:38.131 --> 00:51:43.088
Pluto, we're going the wrong way.
We're going back to town. Turn around.


570
00:51:43.219 --> 00:51:46.422
- Ray, did I kill that man?
- Yes, but you did a good job.


571
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:50.716
What the fuck are you doing?
You're going the wrong way!


572
00:51:50.935 --> 00:51:55.513
The car's been identified.
We have to get rid of it.


573
00:51:55.939 --> 00:51:58.476
Yes, you killed him, goddamn it.

574
00:51:59.192 --> 00:52:02.858
Would you fucking turn the car around?
We're going the wrong way!


575
00:52:03.781 --> 00:52:06.650
We'll pass the motherfuckers, got it?

576
00:52:07.325 --> 00:52:10.160
- The cops will see us.
- We got no fucking choice.


577
00:52:10.828 --> 00:52:14.363
If we head out of town, they'll catch us.
So shut up.


578
00:52:31.766 --> 00:52:34.636
- How are you?
- I got a hangover, but...


579
00:52:34.768 --> 00:52:36.891
Nothing here. Quiet as a Sunday morning.

580
00:52:37.021 --> 00:52:38.479
When did you arrive?

581
00:52:38.606 --> 00:52:42.021
I relieved Charlie around 4:00.
You want some coffee?


582
00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:43.651
- No thanks.
- No.


583
00:52:45.236 --> 00:52:48.190
I was thinking about
what you said last night.


584
00:52:49.158 --> 00:52:52.193
- No wonder you were pissed off.
- I wasn't.


585
00:52:52.453 --> 00:52:54.907
No, you were right.

586
00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:58.122
If that old man hadn't been deaf,
I could have blown the case.


587
00:52:58.249 --> 00:52:59.826
Well, I don't know.

588
00:53:00.125 --> 00:53:04.206
No, I made a mistake.
You know more about this stuff than I do.


589
00:53:04.506 --> 00:53:07.043
I don't want you thinking
we're incompetent.


590
00:53:07.717 --> 00:53:11.132
Dale, you have the energy
and dedication of ten cops.


591
00:53:11.261 --> 00:53:12.425
No shit?

592
00:53:18.269 --> 00:53:20.226
Let me ask you something else.

593
00:53:20.521 --> 00:53:23.640
If I'm full of
shit, you just tell me.

594
00:53:24.024 --> 00:53:26.396
I want to move to L.
A. and join up.

595
00:53:27.195 --> 00:53:28.274
Join up with what?

596
00:53:28.404 --> 00:53:32.483
The police department. I've been
on the force here since I was grown.


597
00:53:32.866 --> 00:53:37.196
After ten years of busting peeping Toms,
I'd like to take a crack at the big time.


598
00:53:38.872 --> 00:53:42.372
I realise getting on the force
is no walk in the park, but...


599
00:53:43.209 --> 00:53:46.660
once we wrap up this case
and with your recommendation...


600
00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.339
well, who knows?

601
00:53:50.467 --> 00:53:53.633
You, me and Macintosh
could make a great team.


602
00:53:54.387 --> 00:53:56.793
That's an interesting idea.

603
00:53:57.848 --> 00:53:59.556
How you doing, Hurricane?

604
00:54:01.894 --> 00:54:04.267
This is Larry Gibson, our local Smokey.

605
00:54:05.522 --> 00:54:08.440
Larry, this is Dud Cole. He's from L.A.

606
00:54:10.694 --> 00:54:13.945
Last night, some folks killed
a Texas State Trooper.


607
00:54:14.407 --> 00:54:16.945
It says here they may
be headed for Houston.


608
00:54:17.868 --> 00:54:21.283
They may fit the description
of the folks you're after.


609
00:54:21.579 --> 00:54:22.990
Son of a bitch.

610
00:54:23.414 --> 00:54:26.747
We may even have a photograph of them
in a convenience store.


611
00:54:27.211 --> 00:54:29.203
- Surveillance camera?
- Yeah.


612
00:54:29.337 --> 00:54:30.333
Texas.

613
00:54:32.007 --> 00:54:34.461
Looks like they're headed our way, boys.

614
00:54:36.303 --> 00:54:37.631
Got another cup?

615
00:54:38.013 --> 00:54:40.300
- You don't mind drinking after me?
- Not at all.


616
00:54:40.431 --> 00:54:41.712
Goddamn. Texas.

617
00:55:01.243 --> 00:55:03.994
Do you think our people
whacked that trooper?


618
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:06.911
We'll know when we see the photo.

619
00:55:09.959 --> 00:55:14.337
Hurricane is waiting on the bad guys
the way a kid waits for Christmas.


620
00:55:15.508 --> 00:55:17.500
Hurricane is a force of nature.

621
00:55:17.801 --> 00:55:19.342
I like old Hurricane.

622
00:55:22.471 --> 00:55:24.050
He's a tremendous guy.

623
00:55:24.808 --> 00:55:27.430
- You know what he told me this morning?
- What?


624
00:55:28.395 --> 00:55:31.146
He wants to come to L.A.
and join the force.


625
00:55:32.606 --> 00:55:34.646
- Are you kidding?
- Honest to God.


626
00:55:35.818 --> 00:55:41.404
He said he thought that me and him
and Macintosh would make a great team.


627
00:55:42.157 --> 00:55:43.152
No shit.

628
00:55:44.743 --> 00:55:47.281
He said he wanted a
crack at the big time.

629
00:55:47.662 --> 00:55:49.205
What did you say?

630
00:55:51.292 --> 00:55:53.580
I told him it was an interesting idea.

631
00:55:56.338 --> 00:55:58.710
That's the funniest thing I ever heard.

632
00:56:00.842 --> 00:56:04.970
Can you imagine that motherfucker
roaming around Parker Center?


633
00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:11.100
He'd "put a stopper in the bottle."

634
00:56:12.729 --> 00:56:15.267
That yokel would last ten minutes.

635
00:56:17.899 --> 00:56:19.773
"Put a stopper in the bottle."

636
00:56:23.447 --> 00:56:26.283
Hurricane, you know
no one's allowed back there.


637
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:30.610
- Just getting a candy bar.
- You plan to pay for it this time?


638
00:56:36.877 --> 00:56:38.750
I saw your car parked out front.

639
00:56:38.878 --> 00:56:41.085
Charlie relieved me a half hour ago.

640
00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:44.547
Dud, I didn't mean to put you
on the spot this morning.


641
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:48.804
Dale, we didn't mean...

642
00:56:48.931 --> 00:56:50.175
That's me.

643
00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:52.391
This is 210.

644
00:56:52.517 --> 00:56:55.471
I just got back from Little Rock
with that picture.


645
00:56:55.727 --> 00:56:58.135
10-4. That's us.

646
00:57:00.358 --> 00:57:01.555
You leave it.

647
00:57:18.167 --> 00:57:20.040
Jimmy, you got it?

648
00:57:36.267 --> 00:57:37.382
That's Ray.

649
00:57:37.769 --> 00:57:40.474
And so that must be
our mystery girl, Fantasia.


650
00:57:44.984 --> 00:57:46.644
Her name's not Fantasia.

651
00:57:49.697 --> 00:57:50.978
It's Lila Walker.

652
00:57:58.706 --> 00:57:59.904
Hey, Pluto.

653
00:58:00.291 --> 00:58:01.619
What's happening?

654
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.292
How are you, Beaver?

655
00:58:05.045 --> 00:58:06.242
They're cool.

656
00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:08.708
Come on in.

657
00:58:16.806 --> 00:58:18.431
- Come on in.
- Go ahead.


658
00:58:25.607 --> 00:58:28.394
This is Fantasia. That's Ray.

659
00:58:30.236 --> 00:58:33.984
That's Joey.
And the whining one on the couch is Kim.


660
00:58:34.406 --> 00:58:37.574
- She had a couple teeth yanked out.
- Fuck you, Beaver.


661
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:42.490
Grab yourself a chair.

662
00:58:56.553 --> 00:58:57.881
You want to sit down?

663
00:58:58.013 --> 00:58:59.638
That's okay. I'm fine.

664
00:59:04.352 --> 00:59:06.475
So where's this multitude of coke?

665
00:59:07.272 --> 00:59:09.560
- Where's Billy?
- He ain't here.


666
00:59:11.443 --> 00:59:13.352
I can see that. Where is he?

667
00:59:13.987 --> 00:59:16.478
He's still in New Orleans.

668
00:59:17.782 --> 00:59:18.981
New Orleans?

669
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:23.913
When will he be here?

670
00:59:24.206 --> 00:59:25.450
Tomorrow night.

671
00:59:27.834 --> 00:59:30.122
He didn't tell me that when we spoke.

672
00:59:31.128 --> 00:59:32.919
He got hung up.

673
00:59:33.671 --> 00:59:36.757
He didn't know that would happen
when he spoke to you.


674
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:43.890
We'll wait for him.

675
00:59:46.142 --> 00:59:48.301
We can't wait. 
We have to go.

676
00:59:49.104 --> 00:59:50.847
We'll wait until tomorrow.

677
00:59:53.232 --> 00:59:54.560
We'll stay here.

678
00:59:55.193 --> 00:59:57.565
I don't think that's such a good idea.

679
00:59:59.114 --> 01:00:01.320
We don't have much room, and...

680
01:00:05.745 --> 01:00:08.033
Yeah, what the fuck, man.

681
01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:11.584
You can have my room.

682
01:00:12.126 --> 01:00:14.083
I've slept on the couch before.

683
01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:17.747
Fuck you, Beaver. 
I'm not moving.

684
01:00:18.466 --> 01:00:19.794
Give me the phone.

685
01:00:19.925 --> 01:00:23.259
Sometimes I think you haven't got
a brain in your head.


686
01:00:23.888 --> 01:00:28.633
I'm going to Star City. The only
reason I got involved in this shit...


687
01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:32.936
is so we'd get some money
and I could go home and see my people.


688
01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.936
That was before all this shit happened.

689
01:00:36.525 --> 01:00:38.813
Now it's about time we got
where we're going.


690
01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:41.314
So what's the problem?

691
01:00:42.322 --> 01:00:45.238
All you have to do is
pick me up on the way.


692
01:00:45.491 --> 01:00:50.320
You know that Pluto isn't going to do that.
You heard what the man said.


693
01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.789
I think it's a good idea.

694
01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:02.463
If she goes ahead of us,
it will be safer to travel.


695
01:01:04.677 --> 01:01:07.048
We won't fit the description so easily.

696
01:01:09.556 --> 01:01:10.671
No problem.

697
01:01:31.202 --> 01:01:32.861
Ain't that some shit.

698
01:01:37.375 --> 01:01:40.162
Can you make it
a whole day without me?

699
01:01:41.171 --> 01:01:42.629
I don't know.

700
01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:48.963
It looks like just her brother
and mama are there.


701
01:01:49.595 --> 01:01:51.303
What kind of people are they?

702
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:53.553
Good people. Christian people.

703
01:01:54.433 --> 01:01:57.102
I can't believe she got mixed up
in this shit.


704
01:01:58.146 --> 01:02:01.146
Hurricane, how is it
that you know this Lila Walker?


705
01:02:03.275 --> 01:02:05.481
I arrested her for shoplifting once.

706
01:02:06.195 --> 01:02:08.317
She was just a kid in high school.

707
01:02:09.156 --> 01:02:12.524
All she took was lipstick
and that shit they put on their eyes.


708
01:02:12.659 --> 01:02:14.319
Wasn't worth ten bucks.

709
01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:18.362
I could tell right off she wasn't bad,
just high-spirited.


710
01:02:19.207 --> 01:02:23.335
So I decided to try to help her out.
You know, talk to her.


711
01:02:24.963 --> 01:02:27.121
Then one day, she just disappeared.

712
01:02:27.966 --> 01:02:29.294
Somebody said...

713
01:02:29.718 --> 01:02:32.753
she took off for Hollywood
to become a movie star.


714
01:02:33.512 --> 01:02:36.513
Anyway, that was about five years ago.

715
01:02:37.224 --> 01:02:39.430
I didn't hear of her again till now.

716
01:02:39.894 --> 01:02:42.219
She's moved up from stealing lipstick.

717
01:02:42.646 --> 01:02:44.769
I don't believe she killed anyone.

718
01:02:45.567 --> 01:02:49.694
That kid in the closet. She opens the door,
sees him, closes the door.


719
01:02:51.614 --> 01:02:53.606
That proves she's not a killer.

720
01:02:54.199 --> 01:02:56.321
Hurricane, that don't prove shit.

721
01:02:58.037 --> 01:03:00.658
So, do we talk to the mother?

722
01:03:01.873 --> 01:03:03.782
- What if she tips off Lila?
- She won't.


723
01:03:05.126 --> 01:03:07.248
She wouldn't do that, not Lila.

724
01:03:07.962 --> 01:03:09.291
Have you heard from her?

725
01:03:09.423 --> 01:03:12.257
No, I haven't. 
Not since last summer.

726
01:03:12.758 --> 01:03:14.668
Some time around June or July.

727
01:03:15.845 --> 01:03:20.173
Mr. Dixon, you know Lila. She wouldn't do
what they're saying she did.


728
01:03:21.184 --> 01:03:23.675
She must have been kidnapped.
Brainwashed.


729
01:03:26.356 --> 01:03:30.684
Some of the best policemen in this country
are after Lila and those fellows.


730
01:03:31.318 --> 01:03:32.943
They'll catch them, too.

731
01:03:34.946 --> 01:03:37.521
It will help Lila
if she turns herself in.

732
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:39.492
Chief Dixon is right.

733
01:03:40.369 --> 01:03:45.030
We can't promise anything, but if she
cooperates, that will have weight later.


734
01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:49.835
I haven't heard from her, but if I do,
I'll tell her what you said.


735
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.794
Ronnie, have you heard from your sister?

736
01:03:56.426 --> 01:03:57.422
No, sir.

737
01:03:58.303 --> 01:04:00.212
Would you tell us if you had?

738
01:04:01.348 --> 01:04:02.343
Yes, sir.

739
01:04:06.101 --> 01:04:07.264
Grandma...

740
01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:09.344
I'm hungry.

741
01:04:10.523 --> 01:04:12.645
Byron, don't bother us now, honey.

742
01:04:13.734 --> 01:04:15.015
Who's that?

743
01:04:15.444 --> 01:04:16.938
That's Lila's boy.

744
01:04:20.575 --> 01:04:22.567
Didn't you know Lila had a boy?

745
01:04:23.619 --> 01:04:25.576
And he's a pretty boy, too.

746
01:04:32.461 --> 01:04:35.295
Thanks for your time.
That's all we need for now.


747
01:04:37.548 --> 01:04:39.791
They're not going to Jeremiah's at all.

748
01:04:39.926 --> 01:04:43.508
No. Fantasia's coming home
to see her kid.


749
01:04:43.804 --> 01:04:47.091
Hurricane, just how well
do you know this gal?


750
01:04:47.392 --> 01:04:48.768
What do you mean?

751
01:04:49.811 --> 01:04:51.009
You know what I mean.

752
01:04:51.145 --> 01:04:53.387
That's real fucking funny.

753
01:06:13.392 --> 01:06:14.387
Fuck!

754
01:06:18.771 --> 01:06:20.052
Goddamn her.

755
01:07:48.441 --> 01:07:50.600
Look at you. You've gone Hollywood.

756
01:07:50.735 --> 01:07:53.487
Look at you, all grown up.

757
01:07:54.447 --> 01:07:56.820
Stand back. Let me
have a look at you.

758
01:07:57.659 --> 01:07:59.201
Yeah, you still ugly.

759
01:07:59.702 --> 01:08:01.778
I'm just playing. 
You look fine.

760
01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:04.492
I'm feeling fine.

761
01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:08.204
I'm going to see my baby. 
I'm going home.

762
01:08:11.881 --> 01:08:14.419
You can't go home. 
The cops are after you.

763
01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:19.169
- What did they say?
- Get in the car.


764
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:25.260
- I didn't do the things they said.
- I know that.


765
01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:31.437
Being on the run makes you look guilty.

766
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.520
I already look guilty.

767
01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.232
Looking guilty is being guilty
for black people.


768
01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:40.983
You know that. 
I won't get a fair trial...

769
01:08:41.534 --> 01:08:43.408
and I won't go to prison.

770
01:08:44.121 --> 01:08:45.745
Chief Dixon said that...

771
01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:49.580
- Dale Dixon?
- He's the one who came to the house.


772
01:08:51.336 --> 01:08:53.209
Didn't you used to know him?

773
01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:56.630
Yeah, I used to know him.

774
01:09:00.052 --> 01:09:03.006
Ron, I didn't come all this way
not to see my baby.


775
01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:07.343
They'll be watching our house...

776
01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:11.308
so you have to take me someplace
outside of town.


777
01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:14.678
Then tonight you bring my baby
out to see me.


778
01:09:15.108 --> 01:09:16.900
Then tomorrow I'll be gone.

779
01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:18.987
Ronnie, please.

780
01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:22.230
I'm your sister. 
I need your help.

781
01:09:28.662 --> 01:09:29.907
Okay, Lila.

782
01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:37.460
A friend of mine's grandma died
a couple of months ago.


783
01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:42.924
She had a house off the highway
past the bait shop.


784
01:09:46.681 --> 01:09:48.507
No one's living there now.

785
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:56.691
I'll be out there all
night, so don't wait up.


786
01:09:57.107 --> 01:09:59.432
Are Dud and John
going to be with you?

787
01:09:59.985 --> 01:10:01.478
No, they're not.

788
01:10:02.361 --> 01:10:05.149
We don't need 19 goddamn people
to watch a house.


789
01:10:05.364 --> 01:10:07.109
I know you're capable of...

790
01:10:07.242 --> 01:10:11.025
Just because I'm not from L.A.,
don't mean I can't watch a house.


791
01:10:14.999 --> 01:10:16.162
Okay?

792
01:10:40.357 --> 01:10:42.683
I love you. You know that, don't you?

793
01:10:43.777 --> 01:10:44.975
I know that.

794
01:10:47.573 --> 01:10:50.359
And I love our little girl
more than anything.


795
01:10:52.577 --> 01:10:53.906
I know that, too.

796
01:12:08.318 --> 01:12:11.817
I would give you every dime
we talked about if I had the money.


797
01:12:13.613 --> 01:12:15.653
The problem is, 
I don't have it.

798
01:12:18.828 --> 01:12:22.956
Your partner's making me nervous.
Sit your ass down, ponytail.


799
01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:31.128
I know you guys are on the run.

800
01:12:32.633 --> 01:12:36.925
You need everything you can get.
It's better than nothing, right?


801
01:12:42.266 --> 01:12:47.261
Let's lighten up.
This town is hot, and so are you.


802
01:12:48.814 --> 01:12:50.854
You're on every goddamn channel.

803
01:12:52.485 --> 01:12:55.236
You got no one else
you can trust but me.

804
01:12:57.491 --> 01:12:59.648
I'm going to let you walk with one.

805
01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.117
You can take it or leave it.

806
01:13:14.214 --> 01:13:15.208
Fucker.

807
01:13:18.051 --> 01:13:20.423
Eight fucking dollars. Who cares?

808
01:13:33.483 --> 01:13:36.055
He has to have more money than that.

809
01:13:36.277 --> 01:13:37.308
Let's go.

810
01:13:40.573 --> 01:13:43.063
Pull over. We're splitting up.

811
01:13:43.492 --> 01:13:45.117
What are you talking about?

812
01:13:45.244 --> 01:13:47.616
Pull over. Everything's fucked up.

813
01:13:47.829 --> 01:13:51.329
We'll split the money and the coke,
then I'm gone.


814
01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.327
I ain't doing that.

815
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:56.125
Don't fuck with me.
Just give me my money.


816
01:13:56.588 --> 01:13:59.506
I can't do that. 
I don't have any money.

817
01:14:00.175 --> 01:14:01.206
Say what?

818
01:14:01.509 --> 01:14:03.300
I don't have any money.

819
01:14:05.222 --> 01:14:06.763
Where's my money?

820
01:14:06.889 --> 01:14:10.140
I ain't got it. 
She took the fucking money.

821
01:14:10.519 --> 01:14:14.183
I got $56. She took it.
Now let go before I have a wreck.


822
01:14:15.899 --> 01:14:17.725
You're a pussy-whipped fucker.

823
01:14:17.859 --> 01:14:21.987
Don't give me that shit. It was your
fucking buddies who had no money.


824
01:14:22.238 --> 01:14:24.231
Your good friend, Billy.

825
01:14:25.116 --> 01:14:29.244
What the fuck am I doing with you?
You're a pussy-whipped motherfucker!


826
01:14:32.206 --> 01:14:35.290
If you want any money,
you'll have to go to Arkansas.


827
01:14:38.211 --> 01:14:39.789
Lila, we got to go.

828
01:14:40.422 --> 01:14:42.331
Just give me a few minutes with him.

829
01:14:42.466 --> 01:14:44.505
It's almost 4:00 in the morning.

830
01:14:47.137 --> 01:14:51.134
It's time for you to go home, go to bed
and get up and see your grandma.


831
01:14:51.933 --> 01:14:55.100
I love you, honey. 
Will you be a good boy?

832
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:57.889
Give me a kiss good-bye.

833
01:14:58.147 --> 01:14:59.642
Come on, Lila.

834
01:15:03.986 --> 01:15:06.110
Take care of my baby, okay?

835
01:15:06.698 --> 01:15:08.275
Will you be all right?

836
01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.829
Ronnie, put the money in the bank, okay?

837
01:15:16.415 --> 01:15:20.033
Ronnie, put the money in the bank, okay?

838
01:16:29.236 --> 01:16:31.359
- How you doing?
- Stop right there.


839
01:16:31.737 --> 01:16:34.822
Turn around.
Put your hands on the counter.


840
01:16:35.449 --> 01:16:36.824
Spread your legs.

841
01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.992
Simon says.

842
01:16:44.918 --> 01:16:46.162
Can I turn around now?

843
01:16:46.294 --> 01:16:47.787
Just stay like that.

844
01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:07.347
Where are your two pals?

845
01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:09.394
Ray and Pluto?

846
01:17:11.777 --> 01:17:13.318
They'll be here soon.

847
01:17:14.361 --> 01:17:15.739
How soon is that?

848
01:17:16.322 --> 01:17:17.521
I don't know.

849
01:17:18.283 --> 01:17:19.943
They have to call first.

850
01:17:22.829 --> 01:17:28.120
How do I know you're not lying?
They might show up here any minute.


851
01:17:30.503 --> 01:17:32.294
I'm not lying to you, Dale.

852
01:17:36.008 --> 01:17:37.716
What will you do with me?

853
01:17:40.972 --> 01:17:43.593
Get in the other room. Go on.

854
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:53.809
Go into the living room.

855
01:17:57.445 --> 01:17:59.069
- What are you doing?
- Sit down.


856
01:17:59.196 --> 01:18:00.394
What are you doing?

857
01:18:00.532 --> 01:18:02.904
Two fellows from L.
A. want to meet you.

858
01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:05.609
- Put the phone down.
- Why?


859
01:18:05.954 --> 01:18:09.488
Ray and Pluto will call here
to see if everything is cool.


860
01:18:10.124 --> 01:18:13.243
I won't answer the phone
if you call those cops.


861
01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:14.699
Yes, you are.

862
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.675
Goddamn it!

863
01:18:24.763 --> 01:18:27.385
Lila, even if I wanted
to, I can't help you.


864
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:33.393
I don't have the legal authority.

865
01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:37.106
You didn't have the authority
to fuck me when I was 17...


866
01:18:37.233 --> 01:18:39.192
but that didn't stop you.

867
01:18:44.032 --> 01:18:45.230
That's right.

868
01:18:46.535 --> 01:18:51.197
Instead of spying on me, why didn't
you come in and say hello to your son?


869
01:18:51.582 --> 01:18:52.910
He's not my kid.

870
01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:57.041
Not your kid?
He's nearly as white as you are.


871
01:18:57.379 --> 01:18:58.576
That proves nothing.

872
01:18:58.713 --> 01:19:00.504
Are you calling me a whore?

873
01:19:10.099 --> 01:19:12.969
I was a virgin when we met
and you know it.


874
01:19:23.236 --> 01:19:24.814
Hear the whippoorwill?

875
01:19:27.241 --> 01:19:30.241
Remember what you said
about hearing a whippoorwill?


876
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:35.870
It means someone's going to die.

877
01:19:52.683 --> 01:19:55.054
Why do we have to
sit here in the dark?

878
01:19:55.351 --> 01:19:58.221
I don't want to be a sitting duck
if they show up.


879
01:19:58.646 --> 01:20:01.433
I told you,
they won't be here until they call.


880
01:20:03.610 --> 01:20:04.688
Where you going?

881
01:20:04.819 --> 01:20:07.225
- My cigarettes are in my purse.
- Get one of mine.


882
01:20:07.362 --> 01:20:10.114
- I smoke menthol.
- I'll get them.


883
01:20:22.294 --> 01:20:24.619
I forgot that thing was even in there.

884
01:20:26.715 --> 01:20:28.837
Ray gave it to me for protection.

885
01:20:30.176 --> 01:20:33.628
- I don't even know how it works.
- You pull the damn trigger.


886
01:20:36.516 --> 01:20:38.723
Why are you looking at me like that?

887
01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:43.105
Did you think I would shoot you?
That's crazy.


888
01:20:44.314 --> 01:20:46.604
Now can I have my cigarettes, please?

889
01:20:58.078 --> 01:20:59.738
You have a light, baby?

890
01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:19.630
Does your wife treat you right?

891
01:21:20.016 --> 01:21:21.558
Yes, Lila, she does.

892
01:21:22.393 --> 01:21:23.556
That's good.

893
01:21:26.273 --> 01:21:28.680
What's her name again? Thelma Lou?

894
01:21:34.529 --> 01:21:35.692
Cheryl Ann.

895
01:21:37.074 --> 01:21:38.272
That's right.

896
01:21:39.326 --> 01:21:41.863
And you and Cheryl
Ann have a little girl.

897
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:44.658
What's her name?

898
01:21:45.332 --> 01:21:46.327
Bonnie.

899
01:21:47.625 --> 01:21:48.870
How old is she?

900
01:21:50.088 --> 01:21:51.083
Eight.

901
01:21:53.631 --> 01:21:56.300
You don't like telling me
about your family, do you?


902
01:21:56.426 --> 01:21:57.885
No, I guess I don't.

903
01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.132
I don't blame you.

904
01:22:04.852 --> 01:22:07.058
- I got something for you.
- Where are you going?


905
01:22:07.186 --> 01:22:08.811
Don't shoot me, officer.

906
01:22:09.605 --> 01:22:11.644
What the hell are you doing now?

907
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:14.142
- Can I turn on the light?
- No.


908
01:22:18.363 --> 01:22:20.487
I put it in
here to keep it fresh.

909
01:22:21.242 --> 01:22:23.732
Can we leave this
open to get some light?

910
01:22:25.288 --> 01:22:27.529
This is our baby's birthday cake.

911
01:22:35.504 --> 01:22:36.881
I don't want any.

912
01:22:38.634 --> 01:22:40.044
Suit yourself.

913
01:22:44.514 --> 01:22:45.628
It's good.

914
01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:48.385
You should try some.

915
01:22:49.603 --> 01:22:51.144
Today's his birthday?

916
01:22:52.021 --> 01:22:54.478
No. It was in September.

917
01:22:55.817 --> 01:22:56.979
I missed it.

918
01:22:57.652 --> 01:23:00.736
I left him with Mama
before he was two years old.


919
01:23:01.782 --> 01:23:04.236
That means I've missed four birthdays...

920
01:23:04.534 --> 01:23:07.202
so we celebrated all four of them
last night.


921
01:23:10.372 --> 01:23:12.162
Does your mama know about...

922
01:23:12.290 --> 01:23:13.371
Know what?

923
01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:17.829
No, I never told her.
I never meant you any trouble, Dale.


924
01:23:19.382 --> 01:23:20.579
I still don't.

925
01:23:22.216 --> 01:23:26.381
Wouldn't Bonnie be surprised to know
she had a half-brother in Nigger Town?


926
01:23:30.725 --> 01:23:33.395
You should have some of our baby's cake...

927
01:23:33.603 --> 01:23:35.227
Quit calling him that.

928
01:23:35.605 --> 01:23:37.266
Why? That's what he is.

929
01:23:38.775 --> 01:23:41.100
Damn it, I told
you I didn't want any.

930
01:23:43.613 --> 01:23:45.652
- Do you want this?
- What are you doing?


931
01:23:45.781 --> 01:23:47.940
- This is what you want.
- Cut it out.


932
01:23:50.161 --> 01:23:52.367
Cut it out, goddamn it!

933
01:23:58.419 --> 01:24:00.375
Why did you ever fuck with me?

934
01:24:04.716 --> 01:24:07.882
Me and my brother's daddy was white,
did you know that?


935
01:24:10.846 --> 01:24:12.757
Of course, we never knew him.

936
01:24:13.767 --> 01:24:15.344
He had another family.

937
01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:20.019
That's why I kind of look white.

938
01:24:20.607 --> 01:24:22.398
Because my daddy was white.

939
01:24:23.401 --> 01:24:27.446
You figured since I kind of look white,
you could fuck me, what the hell.


940
01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:32.323
Because I was kind of black...

941
01:24:32.743 --> 01:24:34.950
you could dump me, what the hell.

942
01:25:14.076 --> 01:25:15.190
211 to 210.

943
01:25:18.037 --> 01:25:19.152
211 to 210.

944
01:25:21.039 --> 01:25:22.154
211 to 210.

945
01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.745
Dale, where are you at?

946
01:25:34.428 --> 01:25:35.507
Hey, June.

947
01:25:36.055 --> 01:25:38.427
Juney! How are you doing?

948
01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:42.475
You got something for me?

949
01:25:44.312 --> 01:25:45.640
Hi, Mr. Charlie.

950
01:26:38.865 --> 01:26:42.282
Is this Ronnie? Ronnie, this is Ray.
Is Fantasia there?


951
01:26:43.536 --> 01:26:44.650
Yeah, Lila.

952
01:26:45.663 --> 01:26:46.860
Where is she?

953
01:26:51.044 --> 01:26:53.499
Have you got a
number out there for her?

954
01:26:56.591 --> 01:26:58.298
Give it to me, all right?

955
01:27:05.975 --> 01:27:08.263
Ronnie! Ronnie, come here.

956
01:27:09.477 --> 01:27:11.137
- Come here.
- I got to go.


957
01:27:18.319 --> 01:27:22.234
If you know something about
Lila being here, you tell these gentlemen.


958
01:27:22.365 --> 01:27:24.940
I don't want you being in trouble.

959
01:27:25.077 --> 01:27:27.947
No, ma'am.
I don't know nothing about that.


960
01:27:29.832 --> 01:27:33.247
June Hawkins told me
he was out last night digging frogs.


961
01:27:34.293 --> 01:27:38.243
Driving back, he saw you driving
in front of him with Byron in the car.


962
01:27:39.632 --> 01:27:41.957
Where had you and Byron been
at 4:00 a.m.?


963
01:27:42.593 --> 01:27:44.336
We've been here all night.

964
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:47.637
June's mixed up. He's old.
He don't see so well.


965
01:27:48.474 --> 01:27:51.973
- I'll make the bastard talk!
- He won't talk. It's his sister.


966
01:27:54.856 --> 01:27:56.515
Can I speak to the boy?

967
01:27:59.401 --> 01:28:01.393
- How are you this morning?
- Fine.


968
01:28:01.779 --> 01:28:03.570
- Pretty sleepy?
- I guess so.


969
01:28:04.322 --> 01:28:07.276
- You go out with Uncle Ronnie last night?
- No.


970
01:28:07.534 --> 01:28:08.529
You sure?

971
01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:11.116
- You didn't see a pretty lady?
- No.


972
01:28:11.706 --> 01:28:12.737
You sure?

973
01:28:13.499 --> 01:28:16.167
- Did Uncle Ronnie tell you to say that?
- Yeah.


974
01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:22.630
So this has just been pretend?

975
01:28:24.301 --> 01:28:27.965
What do you say we stop playing pretend
and play really?


976
01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:33.512
And you really should
spend a night in jail.


977
01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:35.516
So you can tell your sister.

978
01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:53.535
You got to let me go.

979
01:28:56.623 --> 01:28:58.201
I can't do that, Lila.

980
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.375
You can't let them put me in jail.

981
01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:08.706
What's going to happen
to our baby with me in jail?


982
01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:12.170
Your mom will keep taking care of him.

983
01:29:15.934 --> 01:29:17.806
I'll give her money for him.

984
01:29:18.978 --> 01:29:21.100
Why won't you give him the money?

985
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:27.477
Why don't you just say,
"Byron, I'm your daddy"?


986
01:29:35.077 --> 01:29:37.034
I don't see how that would...

987
01:29:41.541 --> 01:29:43.997
I guess it wouldn't be a good idea.

988
01:29:47.047 --> 01:29:50.546
I guess it would be better
just to put me in jail...


989
01:29:51.676 --> 01:29:54.249
and forget about your five-year-old son.

990
01:30:19.411 --> 01:30:20.442
Hi, baby.

991
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:24.449
Yeah, everything's cool.

992
01:30:25.502 --> 01:30:27.161
Everything's real cool.

993
01:30:28.796 --> 01:30:30.834
Ray, where are you calling from?

994
01:30:34.092 --> 01:30:36.251
What's the name of the gas station?

995
01:30:39.889 --> 01:30:41.763
Ray, you missed the turnoff.

996
01:30:42.850 --> 01:30:45.852
It's about half a
mile back up the highway.

997
01:30:48.981 --> 01:30:52.766
You turn right at this place
called Cothern's Bait Shop.


998
01:30:54.612 --> 01:30:56.485
There's a little road there.

999
01:30:58.617 --> 01:31:02.862
You're not far, baby.
Just about ten minutes away. Hurry.


1000
01:31:06.039 --> 01:31:07.415
Yeah, I miss you.

1001
01:31:35.943 --> 01:31:37.603
Is that the road, Byron?

1002
01:31:39.614 --> 01:31:42.365
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?


1003
01:31:46.996 --> 01:31:50.946
When they arrive, get them in the house
and away from the car.


1004
01:31:51.291 --> 01:31:55.241
Open the door, talk to them.
Let them see everything is okay.


1005
01:31:56.005 --> 01:31:58.839
Then stay in the kitchen
until I say to come out.


1006
01:31:59.508 --> 01:32:03.635
Then if they get trigger-happy,
you'll be out of the line of fire.


1007
01:32:06.556 --> 01:32:08.133
Then you'll let me go?

1008
01:32:15.648 --> 01:32:16.929
I'll let you go.

1009
01:32:30.997 --> 01:32:32.989
Is that the road you took?

1010
01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.969
Don't go in there fucking around.
In and out. You got me?


1011
01:32:55.103 --> 01:32:57.428
What do you think I'd do? Don't worry.

1012
01:33:13.413 --> 01:33:15.701
You sure this is it?

1013
01:33:17.708 --> 01:33:18.787
Yeah.

1014
01:35:13.194 --> 01:35:15.483
You got it straight?

1015
01:35:27.667 --> 01:35:28.698
Hi, baby.

1016
01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:33.212
Come on, Fantasia, let's go.

1017
01:35:33.339 --> 01:35:36.126
It'll be a few minutes.
I have to pack my stuff.


1018
01:35:37.635 --> 01:35:40.505
What stuff? All you had was your purse.

1019
01:35:40.971 --> 01:35:42.928
It won't be long. Come on in.

1020
01:35:43.139 --> 01:35:44.136
Shit!

1021
01:35:45.518 --> 01:35:46.681
I'll be back.

1022
01:35:46.811 --> 01:35:50.179
That's bullshit. 
I'm sticking on your ass.

1023
01:35:56.487 --> 01:35:58.859
She better not have bought any clothes.

1024
01:36:00.783 --> 01:36:02.574
What does she have to pack?

1025
01:36:02.868 --> 01:36:04.611
- Come on.
- Be careful. I love you.


1026
01:36:04.744 --> 01:36:06.866
Did you spend any of my money?

1027
01:36:10.792 --> 01:36:14.326
Fantasia? Where did she go?

1028
01:36:14.504 --> 01:36:18.964
Police officers, freeze!
Hands up or I'll blow you to fucking hell!


1029
01:36:19.175 --> 01:36:22.545
- What the fuck?
- Get on the floor! Now!


1030
01:36:22.679 --> 01:36:24.221
Who the fuck are you?

1031
01:36:25.013 --> 01:36:26.887
- You bitch!
- Shut up! Shut up!


1032
01:36:27.016 --> 01:36:29.767
- Why the fuck did you do this?
- I'm sorry.


1033
01:36:30.061 --> 01:36:31.139
Stay back!

1034
01:38:19.583 --> 01:38:20.579
210.

1035
01:38:23.337 --> 01:38:27.714
210, A-1 channel 1. Come in, goddamn it.
Hurry up.


1036
01:38:28.049 --> 01:38:30.504
Hurricane, where the hell have you been?

1037
01:38:31.178 --> 01:38:32.838
I need help out here.

1038
01:38:33.264 --> 01:38:34.673
What's your 10-20?

1039
01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:36.672
Oh, God.

1040
01:38:36.932 --> 01:38:39.424
Dale, what's your 20? 
Where are you?

1041
01:38:39.727 --> 01:38:44.390
I'm off the highway,
two miles down Sulphur Springs road.


1042
01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:49.443
There's a house.
In the woods, there's this house...


1043
01:38:49.904 --> 01:38:51.398
Is there an address?

1044
01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:56.773
I don't know the goddamn address.
Just send some help. And an ambulance.


1045
01:38:57.537 --> 01:39:00.987
I got three suspects down
and I'm hurt pretty bad.


1046
01:39:01.249 --> 01:39:05.245
- Three suspects down.
- You know Sulphur Springs Road?


1047
01:39:06.336 --> 01:39:07.581
Hold on, Byron.

1048
01:39:29.108 --> 01:39:30.353
Charlie, do something.

1049
01:39:30.485 --> 01:39:33.854
Dud, come on! Charlie's taking care of it.
Come on!


1050
01:40:03.225 --> 01:40:05.263
That son of a bitch nailed them.

1051
01:40:17.905 --> 01:40:18.902
Hey, man.

1052
01:40:20.449 --> 01:40:24.910
The ambulance is on the way.
I'll get you some blankets, okay?


1053
01:40:40.343 --> 01:40:41.886
Are you dead, mister?

1054
01:40:42.679 --> 01:40:44.222
Are you dead, mister?

1055
01:40:48.477 --> 01:40:50.635
- No, not quite.
- Where's the lady at?


1056
01:40:52.021 --> 01:40:53.397
She's over there.

1057
01:40:53.773 --> 01:40:57.224
Don't go away. Come back.
Come stay with me.


1058
01:41:04.909 --> 01:41:08.076
- Stay here with me.
- How did you get blood on yourself?


1059
01:41:09.414 --> 01:41:10.789
I got in a fight.

1060
01:41:13.917 --> 01:41:16.373
What do you do with your keys?

1061
01:41:19.715 --> 01:41:21.791
I lock things up.

1062
01:41:23.051 --> 01:41:25.341
Come here. I can't see your face.

1063
01:41:26.721 --> 01:41:28.761
Come a little closer.

1064
01:41:32.103 --> 01:41:33.265
Your name...

1065
01:41:34.812 --> 01:41:35.975
is Byron.

1066
01:41:38.983 --> 01:41:40.726
You're five years old.

1067
01:41:42.404 --> 01:41:43.602
Four or five?

1068
01:41:43.989 --> 01:41:44.984
Five.

1069
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:49.028
Just come sit with me.
