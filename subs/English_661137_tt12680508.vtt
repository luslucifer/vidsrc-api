1
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.139
I'm trapped.

2
00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:26.508
- Ethan.
- You've made me unemployable.


3
00:00:26.532 --> 00:00:28.534
Ethan, stop.

4
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:30.623
If you're determined to go, go.

5
00:00:31.624 --> 00:00:33.321
Good luck.

6
00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:36.585
But you'll get no credit
here, and no support from me.


7
00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:38.892
You'll be doing this
on your own.


8
00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:41.112
Oh, so this is
about my consciousness work.


9
00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.199
Not yours.

10
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.117
Everything generated here
belongs to the university.


11
00:00:46.204 --> 00:00:47.335
You mean you?

12
00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.902
That's how this works.

13
00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:56.127
Every thought, every half-baked
idea inside your head


14
00:00:56.214 --> 00:00:57.563
starts with me.

15
00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.226
Sometimes he
won't open it for weeks.


16
00:01:52.313 --> 00:01:54.098
If it's urgent, people call.

17
00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:55.751
Okay, I swear, 
I can't with him.

18
00:01:55.838 --> 00:01:57.558
He would starve if I
didn't tell him to eat.


19
00:01:57.623 --> 00:02:00.104
- So.
- Wait, you opened my mail?


20
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:01.975
- I did.
- You can't do that.


21
00:02:02.062 --> 00:02:05.544
Dr. Ethan Kochar, we are
grateful for the opportunity


22
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:07.328
to consider your article.

23
00:02:07.415 --> 00:02:08.808
We are pleased to inform you...

24
00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.505
- Read the punchline.
- I know, I know,


25
00:02:10.592 --> 00:02:12.432
that your article on
protein folding and memory


26
00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:16.120
will be the focus of the March

27
00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:18.209
What?

28
00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:19.036
You serious?

29
00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:20.602
Pretty good.

30
00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.648
See, I should open
your mail more often.


31
00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:32.658
Believe it or not, that
is not a telenovela clip.


32
00:02:33.398 --> 00:02:35.922
It is a memory of yours truly

33
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.970
from when I made
the cover of Nature.


34
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:45.671
So how did we capture it?

35
00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:48.979
You'll recall that
memories exist


36
00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:52.069
as physical imprints
on the brain.


37
00:02:52.983 --> 00:02:56.899
The R-9X identifies
these engrams


38
00:02:56.987 --> 00:02:58.727
based on their
protein expressions


39
00:02:58.814 --> 00:03:01.556
and transfers that data from
our internal hard drives


40
00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:03.558
to external ones.

41
00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:06.474
But making those memories
legible is a challenge


42
00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.606
in and of itself.

43
00:03:07.693 --> 00:03:09.869
You remember Berkeley, 2011.

44
00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:13.438
Before I took over, the
R-9X could not render images


45
00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.092
more clear than that.

46
00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:19.661
So what do you think was
missing?


47
00:03:23.187 --> 00:03:24.187
Emotions?

48
00:03:24.884 --> 00:03:26.755
Thank you, Rachel, yes.

49
00:03:26.842 --> 00:03:30.716
Euphoria, fear, lust.

50
00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:36.287
Every memory is tied to an
emotional section of our brain,


51
00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:40.639
even the ones that we bury
deep in our subconscious.


52
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.013
A sound, a smell, a shape

53
00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.755
is all it takes for recall.

54
00:04:58.282 --> 00:04:59.674
Shit.

55
00:05:02.721 --> 00:05:06.986
So to get to legible memories,

56
00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:09.945
I knew that mapping emotions was
key.


57
00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:13.123
May 16th, 2019.

58
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.477
Previous findings show that
the R-9X can download memories.


59
00:05:20.956 --> 00:05:23.959
Current experimentation is
a progression of that work.


60
00:05:25.004 --> 00:05:28.529
Our major premise, the
link between our emotions


61
00:05:28.616 --> 00:05:31.967
and our accumulated memories
regulates human consciousness.


62
00:05:33.012 --> 00:05:36.842
Minor premise, the R-10
can isolate the sections


63
00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:40.976
of the brain which impact
emotions and behavior.


64
00:05:41.063 --> 00:05:44.154
Conclusion, the R-10 is capable

65
00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:46.156
of controlling human
consciousness.


66
00:05:56.253 --> 00:06:00.692
So why does this matter anyway?

67
00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.087
I mean, it's nice to be
able to watch our memories


68
00:06:05.175 --> 00:06:08.395
like home videos, but to what
end?


69
00:06:10.354 --> 00:06:12.356
What about affecting
consciousness?


70
00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.142
The emotions tied to memories

71
00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.492
exist along synaptic pathways,
right?


72
00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:23.018
So what if our ideal
self's just a question


73
00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:26.021
of turning the right ones on and
off?


74
00:06:31.897 --> 00:06:33.594
Isn't that, like, unethical?

75
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:35.205
Ah, there he is.

76
00:06:36.075 --> 00:06:37.511
All right, how so, Mitchell?

77
00:06:38.382 --> 00:06:39.861
We're talking about altering

78
00:06:39.948 --> 00:06:41.428
what makes you you.

79
00:06:41.515 --> 00:06:43.822
Does anybody else find
Mitchell's stubbornness,


80
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:44.989
endearing or is it just me?

81
00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:49.131
I'm talking about a machine
calibrated to the individual.


82
00:06:50.132 --> 00:06:54.224
A machine that can erase a
veteran's PTSD,


83
00:06:55.442 --> 00:06:58.750
that suppresses the reward
center for an opioid junkie,


84
00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:02.319
and that could boost your
intellect.


85
00:07:02.406 --> 00:07:05.278
I'm sure some of you
could benefit from that.


86
00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:09.587
Imagine, consciousness
constructed to your own liking.


87
00:07:10.892 --> 00:07:13.895
Memories curated to a desired
state.


88
00:07:13.982 --> 00:07:17.290
And yes, perhaps,

89
00:07:17.377 --> 00:07:20.380
changing yourself for the
better.


90
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.385
All right, well, that's
enough for this week.


91
00:07:25.472 --> 00:07:29.389
Be sure to read my essay on
the self and temporal sequence


92
00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:31.565
by next class.

93
00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:33.784
Have a great week.

94
00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:48.408
Still struggling with the
initiation.


95
00:07:49.322 --> 00:07:51.411
But I've ruled out the
distributors,


96
00:07:51.498 --> 00:07:54.675
so it must be the equation.

97
00:07:58.636 --> 00:08:02.422
Side note, I had another
blackout this morning.


98
00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:08.167
Indeterminate time, but they
are becoming more frequent.


99
00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:11.562
I'm still hoping that
the R-10 can pinpoint.


100
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.823
A man whose journey into
the mind


101
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.870
is the basis for all those who
come after.


102
00:09:00.132 --> 00:09:03.614
His work, fully realized in the
R-9X,


103
00:09:03.701 --> 00:09:06.965
is perhaps the most
groundbreaking discovery


104
00:09:07.052 --> 00:09:08.836
of this century.

105
00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:13.580
With applications from
education to national security.


106
00:09:14.668 --> 00:09:17.671
So before I present the
plaque for our new lab,


107
00:09:17.758 --> 00:09:21.458
I've asked Dr. Kochar's
partner to say a few words.


108
00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:25.940
The co-creator of the
R-9X, Dr. Malcolm Bloom.


109
00:09:31.729 --> 00:09:35.646
Thank you, Dean Myers, and
thank you all for coming.


110
00:09:36.734 --> 00:09:40.477
We were all fortunate
enough to know Dr. Kochar.


111
00:09:41.434 --> 00:09:43.523
But for a cocksure doctoral
student,


112
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.005
a position in his lab was dumb
luck.


113
00:09:48.572 --> 00:09:51.705
I never questioned his
judgment, never had to.


114
00:09:53.446 --> 00:09:56.667
Until he asked me to be his
partner.


115
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.107
You can say that I knew
Paul better than most.


116
00:10:02.194 --> 00:10:03.587
No one could match his
brilliance.


117
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:09.767
Kendall, Kahneman, Einstein,
these are his equals.


118
00:10:11.203 --> 00:10:13.901
We'll be hard-pressed to see
Dr. Paul Kochar's influence


119
00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.990
matched in our lifetime.

120
00:10:22.736 --> 00:10:23.955
There's the wunderkind.

121
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.263
You're a hard man to track down.

122
00:10:30.309 --> 00:10:31.309
How's it coming?

123
00:10:32.616 --> 00:10:33.921
- Good.
- Good.


124
00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:35.967
That's good to hear.

125
00:10:36.054 --> 00:10:37.185
Good enough for tomorrow.

126
00:10:38.317 --> 00:10:39.623
I thought you rescheduled.

127
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.668
I did, for tomorrow.

128
00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:42.539
No.

129
00:10:42.626 --> 00:10:43.757
No, no, no, no.

130
00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:45.367
Come on, Ethan, work with me,

131
00:10:45.455 --> 00:10:46.954
so I can keep the committee off
your back.


132
00:10:46.978 --> 00:10:49.371
Yeah, well, you do it best.

133
00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:50.895
Well I've got practice.

134
00:10:50.982 --> 00:10:53.245
Ethan, look, you're going
through a lot.


135
00:10:53.332 --> 00:10:54.572
I get it, we all miss your dad.

136
00:10:56.204 --> 00:10:58.729
They'll replace you with someone
else if you don't deliver.


137
00:10:58.816 --> 00:11:00.339
I thought I already did.

138
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.039
I fought hard for your credit,

139
00:11:05.126 --> 00:11:07.825
but the R-9 was started
with your father and me.


140
00:11:11.524 --> 00:11:13.091
You want one?

141
00:11:13.178 --> 00:11:14.396
No, I quit.

142
00:11:14.484 --> 00:11:15.484
Really?

143
00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:21.316
Everyone who matters knows
you finished the R-9.


144
00:11:21.403 --> 00:11:23.275
Forget the patent plaque.

145
00:11:26.017 --> 00:11:27.017
Please, Ethan.

146
00:11:28.193 --> 00:11:30.195
It's, it's not ready.

147
00:11:30.282 --> 00:11:31.762
Then bullshit your way through.

148
00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:34.155
Whatever you're working on,
present it.


149
00:11:34.242 --> 00:11:36.418
Ethan, we need this renewal.

150
00:11:36.506 --> 00:11:37.586
I'm gonna need you at 9:30.

151
00:11:37.637 --> 00:11:38.917
I need you to be there tomorrow.

152
00:11:38.943 --> 00:11:40.858
- Yeah.
- 9:30, okay?


153
00:11:46.037 --> 00:11:47.037
Sir?

154
00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:51.041
Sir.

155
00:11:55.394 --> 00:11:57.396
Are you sure you want another?

156
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.138
Yeah.

157
00:12:00.225 --> 00:12:01.835
Okay, this is the last one.

158
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.765
What's that?

159
00:12:23.727 --> 00:12:24.945
Oh, it's...

160
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.865
It's nothing, it's a snowflake.

161
00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:35.608
What?

162
00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:37.895
I'm grateful we didn't lose her
to those Stanford hacks.


163
00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.351
Can't I be grateful?

164
00:12:39.438 --> 00:12:41.048
We'll talk about it later.

165
00:12:41.745 --> 00:12:43.224
I am so sorry.

166
00:12:43.311 --> 00:12:45.313
He's just excited you're
back from Stanford.


167
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.228
Yeah, it's not a problem.

168
00:12:47.315 --> 00:12:50.362
And Joe told me you're in
talks about the Kochar lab.


169
00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:53.670
Congratulations, you must be
thrilled.


170
00:12:53.757 --> 00:12:55.889
Thank you, Lauren, it
was great to see you.


171
00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:58.413
Have a good night.

172
00:13:00.633 --> 00:13:01.895
Okay, sure.

173
00:13:02.722 --> 00:13:03.897
Thank you.

174
00:13:17.781 --> 00:13:19.260
Hi.

175
00:13:19.347 --> 00:13:20.347
Hey.

176
00:13:22.524 --> 00:13:24.048
You want one?

177
00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:25.135
I'm fine.

178
00:13:29.053 --> 00:13:31.359
How are you doing, Ethan?

179
00:13:33.231 --> 00:13:34.232
I'm great.

180
00:13:36.974 --> 00:13:39.759
I saw you talking with Malcolm
earlier.


181
00:13:39.846 --> 00:13:40.978
How'd that go?

182
00:13:41.848 --> 00:13:44.024
I figured he told you.

183
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:45.852
Just about tomorrow.

184
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.942
Are you ready?

185
00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:50.640
Would it be better if I wasn't?

186
00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:55.079
Why don't I take you home?

187
00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:05.002
You trying to get me
in bed, Dr. Fischer?


188
00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:08.135
If memory serves, you're
no use in your current state.


189
00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:10.441
Mm.

190
00:14:12.705 --> 00:14:15.316
Come on, I was an early
programmer, remember?


191
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.318
Let me help you prepare.

192
00:14:18.145 --> 00:14:19.253
I work better when I don't have

193
00:14:19.277 --> 00:14:20.670
to walk you through things.

194
00:14:28.547 --> 00:14:29.853
It's just...

195
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.376
- I'd rather...
- It's fine.


196
00:15:05.932 --> 00:15:07.325
This is my work!

197
00:15:07.412 --> 00:15:09.022
If you're gonna make me choose,
I won't!


198
00:15:09.109 --> 00:15:10.545
I'm not asking
you to choose, Ethan!


199
00:15:10.632 --> 00:15:12.765
It's not me or the
work, you can have both.


200
00:15:14.462 --> 00:15:15.744
I don't know
what else to say to you.


201
00:15:15.768 --> 00:15:17.509
If you wanna go, go.

202
00:15:17.596 --> 00:15:19.685
You could tell me to stay.

203
00:15:19.772 --> 00:15:21.643
I want you to say that.

204
00:15:52.849 --> 00:15:53.980
Hello?

205
00:15:54.067 --> 00:15:55.721
Hey Mom, how are you?

206
00:15:56.635 --> 00:15:59.203
Ethan, it's almost one.

207
00:15:59.943 --> 00:16:01.422
What's wrong?

208
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:02.859
It's fine, everything's great.

209
00:16:02.946 --> 00:16:05.339
Did you send me something in the
mail?


210
00:16:07.124 --> 00:16:09.213
No, what is it?

211
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.868
One of Dad's old notebooks.

212
00:16:11.955 --> 00:16:13.391
Notebook?

213
00:16:13.478 --> 00:16:15.785
Yeah, it's got a
bunch of his work in it.


214
00:16:21.442 --> 00:16:22.617
Mom?

215
00:16:22.704 --> 00:16:24.532
I'm here.

216
00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:27.144
I didn't send it, you know I
don't have anything of his.


217
00:16:28.145 --> 00:16:29.276
Shit.

218
00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:30.800
What is it?

219
00:16:30.887 --> 00:16:32.149
It's my nose.

220
00:16:32.236 --> 00:16:33.237
What?

221
00:16:33.324 --> 00:16:35.282
Nothing, I hit my nose.

222
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:38.720
Was it another episode?

223
00:16:38.808 --> 00:16:39.808
Yes.

224
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:41.810
When?

225
00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:44.248
This morning, in the bathtub.

226
00:16:45.118 --> 00:16:48.687
And then again at the
dedication.


227
00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.123
Two?

228
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.570
Ethan, you need to get checked
out,


229
00:16:51.603 --> 00:16:53.910
it's been eight months of this.

230
00:16:53.997 --> 00:16:55.041
Yeah, I know, I'm fine.

231
00:16:55.128 --> 00:16:57.957
Hey, are you sure you don't know

232
00:16:58.044 --> 00:17:00.264
anything about this notebook?

233
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:01.918
Positive.

234
00:17:02.005 --> 00:17:02.919
It's not like he shared
any of that with me


235
00:17:03.006 --> 00:17:04.485
when we were married.

236
00:17:04.572 --> 00:17:07.097
Okay, well I gotta, gotta go.

237
00:17:07.184 --> 00:17:09.012
I got a big day tomorrow.

238
00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:12.015
All right, well,
thanks for the wake up call.


239
00:17:12.102 --> 00:17:13.930
No, I know, sorry.

240
00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:24.984
Just promise
me you'll get checked out


241
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:26.290
as soon as you can.

242
00:17:29.336 --> 00:17:31.382
The university doesn't have to
know.


243
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.603
You know Peggy Sanders,
Darren's mom?


244
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.389
Had horrible migraines, just
horrible.


245
00:17:39.346 --> 00:17:41.044
He was able to get her to a
specialist


246
00:17:41.131 --> 00:17:43.089
who cleared it right up.

247
00:17:44.395 --> 00:17:46.745
I'm gonna call her, see
if I can get a referral.


248
00:17:48.747 --> 00:17:52.446
You have to take better care of
yourself.


249
00:17:54.231 --> 00:17:55.231
Ethan?

250
00:17:59.236 --> 00:18:00.890
Mom, I gotta go.

251
00:19:06.085 --> 00:19:07.085
Holy shit.

252
00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:13.223
May 17th, 2019.

253
00:19:14.093 --> 00:19:16.269
12:58 a.m. and counting.

254
00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:20.665
R-10 has a calibrated map of my
brain.


255
00:19:20.752 --> 00:19:24.974
I'm counting nine sections.

256
00:19:25.061 --> 00:19:29.543
Oh, there's a high
co-activity in my cerebellum


257
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.677
and prefrontal cortex in section
five.


258
00:19:33.634 --> 00:19:36.072
Labeling section five

259
00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:40.250
as my core intellect.

260
00:19:45.516 --> 00:19:49.999
Okay, I'm going to isolate
section five


261
00:19:50.912 --> 00:19:55.091
and attenuate the others for an
hour.


262
00:19:56.353 --> 00:19:58.268
See if I get any smarter.

263
00:19:58.355 --> 00:19:59.355
Why not?

264
00:20:02.185 --> 00:20:03.185
Baseline note.

265
00:20:03.838 --> 00:20:05.623
I'm a little drunk.

266
00:21:05.335 --> 00:21:06.466
It's 1:03 a.m.

267
00:21:10.253 --> 00:21:15.171
No discernible boost
in cognitive awareness.


268
00:21:16.476 --> 00:21:17.476
At least not yet.

269
00:22:22.194 --> 00:22:23.456
Shit.

270
00:22:25.197 --> 00:22:26.197
Shit!

271
00:23:11.635 --> 00:23:12.635
Shit.

272
00:23:19.033 --> 00:23:20.165
Another blackout.

273
00:23:20.252 --> 00:23:23.342
Full memory loss for an hour.

274
00:23:25.692 --> 00:23:29.130
Let's look again at the
memory wipe from last year.


275
00:23:29.218 --> 00:23:32.612
I had a week of anterograde
amnesia,


276
00:23:32.699 --> 00:23:34.048
and now these blackouts.

277
00:23:35.659 --> 00:23:37.443
But I don't know, this
one feels different.


278
00:23:39.228 --> 00:23:42.231
As for last night's experiment,

279
00:23:43.754 --> 00:23:45.625
intelligence isolation appear...

280
00:23:52.241 --> 00:23:54.286
Intelligence isolation appear...

281
00:23:54.373 --> 00:23:55.766
Don't get me wrong,

282
00:23:55.853 --> 00:23:57.985
I'm glad you're in such a good
mood,


283
00:23:58.072 --> 00:24:00.814
but I just can't help but worry

284
00:24:00.901 --> 00:24:03.208
after how you sounded last
night.


285
00:24:03.295 --> 00:24:04.905
I know how much you've dealing
with...


286
00:24:04.992 --> 00:24:06.672
Hey Mom, I'm sorry,
I can't talk right now.


287
00:24:16.787 --> 00:24:17.787
Coil readout.

288
00:24:20.312 --> 00:24:21.487
All the coils are up.

289
00:24:22.532 --> 00:24:23.968
Who ran this?

290
00:24:24.055 --> 00:24:26.362
I didn't run this, who the fuck
ran this?


291
00:24:26.449 --> 00:24:29.756
12:05, 25 seconds, 26.

292
00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:30.843
27.

293
00:24:34.326 --> 00:24:36.328
Okay, 55, 56, 57.

294
00:24:37.547 --> 00:24:39.331
Six minutes, six minutes past,

295
00:24:39.418 --> 00:24:41.159
six, six...

296
00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:44.902
Christ!

297
00:24:44.989 --> 00:24:46.730
I could've fucking killed you,
man!


298
00:24:48.209 --> 00:24:50.255
Get the fuck out of, oh my god.

299
00:25:19.023 --> 00:25:21.112
Okay, it's 2:04 p.m.

300
00:25:21.199 --> 00:25:23.636
I don't know how, but someone
set up the security system.


301
00:25:23.723 --> 00:25:27.161
There are four live feeds
set up around the house.


302
00:25:27.248 --> 00:25:31.122
I'm gonna try to figure
out what's going on.


303
00:26:38.145 --> 00:26:39.582
Can I help you, Malcolm?

304
00:26:42.454 --> 00:26:44.587
You wanna tell me what
happened this morning?


305
00:26:46.415 --> 00:26:49.679
Oh, yeah, the grant renewal.

306
00:26:49.766 --> 00:26:50.766
Yeah.

307
00:26:51.855 --> 00:26:53.160
I got a little tied up here.

308
00:26:57.817 --> 00:26:58.817
All right.

309
00:26:59.428 --> 00:27:00.864
Open the door.

310
00:27:00.951 --> 00:27:01.951
I can't do that.

311
00:27:03.475 --> 00:27:05.521
I'll talk to you tomorrow, I
promise.


312
00:27:05.608 --> 00:27:09.481
Hey, you're not the only
person on this project.


313
00:27:10.482 --> 00:27:12.615
You fuck up, it comes back on
me.


314
00:27:15.139 --> 00:27:17.446
Malcolm, the only reason
why they listen to you


315
00:27:17.533 --> 00:27:19.491
is because you got me to come
back.


316
00:27:22.668 --> 00:27:26.193
My work on this project
was just as crucial as yours.


317
00:27:27.194 --> 00:27:28.718
You wanna escalate this?

318
00:27:28.805 --> 00:27:30.807
I'm more than happy to involve
the police.


319
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.073
Either way, you're gonna open up
the door.


320
00:27:41.861 --> 00:27:42.861
Okay.

321
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.865
Just give me a minute.

322
00:28:28.691 --> 00:28:30.519
Oh, baby.

323
00:28:30.606 --> 00:28:32.999
Like an angel!

324
00:28:33.086 --> 00:28:33.957
Shut up.

325
00:28:34.044 --> 00:28:35.611
See, time is curved.

326
00:28:36.699 --> 00:28:38.614
This is how it's supposed to be.

327
00:29:29.752 --> 00:29:31.405
Okay.

328
00:29:31.492 --> 00:29:33.669
It's 1:32 p.m.

329
00:29:33.756 --> 00:29:35.255
I've installed four
wireless security cameras


330
00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:37.760
around the house so we
can track my behaviors.


331
00:29:37.847 --> 00:29:39.607
Instead of suppressing
my competing emotions,


332
00:29:39.631 --> 00:29:41.241
it seems we've isolated them.

333
00:29:41.328 --> 00:29:44.810
Looks like 10 sections,
including the default.


334
00:29:44.897 --> 00:29:47.465
Be sure to take precautions
against any outliers.


335
00:29:49.685 --> 00:29:50.685
Time to work.

336
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.069
Can anybody hear me?

337
00:30:27.461 --> 00:30:28.767
Hello!

338
00:30:28.854 --> 00:30:29.768
- Alli?
- Ethan, what the fuck?


339
00:30:29.855 --> 00:30:31.161
What, what happened?

340
00:30:31.248 --> 00:30:32.268
- You tell me!
- No, I don't know


341
00:30:32.292 --> 00:30:33.511
what you're doing here.

342
00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:35.034
Malcolm sent me, I told
you that.


343
00:30:35.121 --> 00:30:36.470
Why are you in this room?

344
00:30:36.557 --> 00:30:38.081
You locked me in.

345
00:30:38.168 --> 00:30:41.475
You took my phone, you
were all over the place.


346
00:30:44.478 --> 00:30:45.523
Hello?

347
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.090
You were trying to fuck me.

348
00:30:47.177 --> 00:30:49.353
And then you passed out, and
I...


349
00:30:52.443 --> 00:30:53.443
Ethan?

350
00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.620
Ethan.

351
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.200
What are you doing here?

352
00:31:14.987 --> 00:31:17.511
I screwed everything up.

353
00:31:17.598 --> 00:31:18.861
No, wait, wait.

354
00:31:18.948 --> 00:31:20.601
Please, please, please,
don't go.


355
00:31:20.689 --> 00:31:22.168
- Please don't.
- Okay.


356
00:31:22.255 --> 00:31:24.518
- Please don't leave me.
- Ethan, calm down.


357
00:31:26.042 --> 00:31:27.434
I'll be right back, okay?

358
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:03.035
What are you doing in there?

359
00:32:03.122 --> 00:32:05.255
Ethan, just tell me what's
going on.


360
00:32:07.083 --> 00:32:08.998
Tell me what the fuck
you were doing in there.


361
00:32:13.567 --> 00:32:14.567
Don't, no, no, no!

362
00:32:14.612 --> 00:32:15.831
- No!
- Get out!


363
00:32:15.918 --> 00:32:19.835
Open the door, Alli!

364
00:32:19.922 --> 00:32:21.967
Open the door, open the door!

365
00:32:22.054 --> 00:32:24.709
Malcolm, it's me, I'm
at Ethan's.


366
00:32:25.492 --> 00:32:26.972
- Something's happened.
- Baby?


367
00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:28.495
Just call me when you get this,

368
00:32:28.582 --> 00:32:29.908
or I'll explain when I
get back to the office.


369
00:32:29.932 --> 00:32:31.107
Can I come in?

370
00:32:32.891 --> 00:32:35.546
Hey, I'm sorry, I don't
know what happened before.


371
00:32:37.461 --> 00:32:40.812
Hey, remember when we
went down to the stacks,


372
00:32:40.899 --> 00:32:45.686
and oh god, you were so wild.

373
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:51.518
I can't stop thinking about it.

374
00:32:54.391 --> 00:32:55.914
I want you so bad right now.

375
00:33:02.007 --> 00:33:03.617
Ethan?

376
00:33:03.704 --> 00:33:04.704
Ethan.

377
00:33:05.315 --> 00:33:06.620
Ethan, wake up.

378
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:19.981
Alli?

379
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.812
Alli, please wait.

380
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:27.337
Look, Ethan, back off.

381
00:33:27.424 --> 00:33:28.904
Alli, please wait.

382
00:33:29.992 --> 00:33:31.776
This is monumental for both of
us.


383
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.085
Last night I had a breakthrough,

384
00:33:36.172 --> 00:33:37.826
but it left my consciousness
fractured,


385
00:33:37.913 --> 00:33:40.263
so now there are 10 of us.

386
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.980
But we each only have
six minutes every hour,


387
00:33:42.004 --> 00:33:43.919
which is why I need your help.

388
00:33:44.006 --> 00:33:45.659
I only have a few minutes left.

389
00:33:45.746 --> 00:33:48.532
I need you to wait here
'til the top of the hour.


390
00:33:48.619 --> 00:33:50.926
That's when the default
is back in control.


391
00:33:53.015 --> 00:33:54.015
Look.

392
00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.630
I think you're gonna
wanna see where this goes.


393
00:34:36.797 --> 00:34:38.234
That's the R-10.

394
00:34:38.321 --> 00:34:39.800
It's a build out of the R-9,

395
00:34:39.888 --> 00:34:42.151
but it can direct energy
at emotion and behavior.


396
00:34:42.238 --> 00:34:45.328
I finally got it to map, so I
figured, okay, what the hell.


397
00:34:45.415 --> 00:34:47.939
Let's isolate my
intellect, see the effect.


398
00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:51.682
But this morning, I wake up,

399
00:34:51.769 --> 00:34:55.860
and suddenly I'm skipping
through time.


400
00:34:55.947 --> 00:34:57.664
I'd been having these blackouts,
so I figured it was that,


401
00:34:57.688 --> 00:35:01.997
but it keeps happening, like
clockwork.


402
00:35:02.084 --> 00:35:04.695
Six minutes every hour.

403
00:35:06.697 --> 00:35:08.786
So what were the blackouts
before?


404
00:35:10.396 --> 00:35:12.616
Another experiment after my
dad died.


405
00:35:15.271 --> 00:35:16.271
Okay.

406
00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:19.381
So you were trying to cycle
through these fragments?


407
00:35:19.405 --> 00:35:21.712
No, I wanted to attenuate
the others for an hour,


408
00:35:21.799 --> 00:35:25.194
but the sequencing's off,
so every six minutes,


409
00:35:25.281 --> 00:35:27.065
another section gets a turn.

410
00:35:27.152 --> 00:35:28.675
Like DID.

411
00:35:28.762 --> 00:35:31.026
Kind of, but these aren't
personalities.


412
00:35:31.113 --> 00:35:32.113
It's all still me.

413
00:35:33.985 --> 00:35:36.683
So what were you trying to
isolate?


414
00:35:37.423 --> 00:35:38.468
Hard to say.

415
00:35:40.035 --> 00:35:41.490
The patterns for intellect
are easy to spot,


416
00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:43.168
but the others are less
pronounced.


417
00:35:47.303 --> 00:35:48.739
You know, there are some things

418
00:35:48.826 --> 00:35:50.523
you shouldn't try to control.

419
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.972
What's it feel like when you
shift?


420
00:36:10.326 --> 00:36:11.326
Headache.

421
00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:14.460
Everything gets fuzzy.

422
00:36:14.547 --> 00:36:16.419
I feel like I'm underwater.

423
00:36:16.506 --> 00:36:18.203
Why?

424
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.553
I was thinking, sometimes
dissociative patients


425
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.208
can fight off a shift if
they know the triggers.


426
00:36:23.295 --> 00:36:26.951
So if this is similar, maybe
you can push through, too.


427
00:36:27.038 --> 00:36:28.038
Yeah, maybe.

428
00:36:29.736 --> 00:36:32.130
The next time you feel it
coming, just try to focus.


429
00:36:32.217 --> 00:36:33.218
It could buy us time.

430
00:36:36.439 --> 00:36:38.136
Don't touch that, Ethan.

431
00:36:38.223 --> 00:36:39.223
Did you do that?

432
00:36:40.791 --> 00:36:42.203
I'm presetting this video
to play during your section.


433
00:36:42.227 --> 00:36:45.100
That's section five, my
intellect.


434
00:36:45.187 --> 00:36:46.710
He's the one I talked to.

435
00:36:48.059 --> 00:36:51.280
So, the cycling is not
sustainable.


436
00:36:51.367 --> 00:36:53.543
We're losing too much oxygen,
which means we're getting


437
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.632
some cortical-spreading
depression.


438
00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:58.113
And these headaches, they're
gonna get worse and worse


439
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.549
'til there's cell death.

440
00:36:59.636 --> 00:37:00.830
We need to get
to the reintegration


441
00:37:00.854 --> 00:37:02.117
as fast as possible.

442
00:37:02.204 --> 00:37:03.988
You're the one section that's in
balance,


443
00:37:04.075 --> 00:37:06.730
so we need to map you across the
whole.


444
00:37:06.817 --> 00:37:08.297
That's the reintegration,

445
00:37:08.384 --> 00:37:11.952
it's like a reboot using
your consciousness.


446
00:37:12.953 --> 00:37:14.868
Okay, you have 20
seconds before you shift.


447
00:37:14.955 --> 00:37:17.151
When that happens, Alli, I'm
gonna need you to go to my room


448
00:37:17.175 --> 00:37:18.307
and lock the door.

449
00:37:18.394 --> 00:37:20.135
I'll need you back here at 6:30.

450
00:37:20.222 --> 00:37:22.354
Interact with only me and the
default.


451
00:37:24.748 --> 00:37:26.054
You have five seconds.

452
00:37:31.059 --> 00:37:32.059
Ethan.

453
00:37:35.585 --> 00:37:37.500
Ethan, just look at me.

454
00:37:39.371 --> 00:37:41.982
You gotta try, 
Ethan, come on.

455
00:38:04.527 --> 00:38:07.269
Okay, section one now.

456
00:38:10.315 --> 00:38:12.709
It's up.

457
00:38:12.796 --> 00:38:14.102
There's no system confirmation,

458
00:38:14.189 --> 00:38:15.389
but it's showing a power drop.

459
00:38:17.105 --> 00:38:19.107
Still not isolating
the coils correctly.


460
00:38:21.283 --> 00:38:24.199
What about the old sequential
startup?


461
00:38:24.286 --> 00:38:25.548
Good idea.

462
00:38:25.635 --> 00:38:26.897
Which coil's reading?

463
00:38:28.507 --> 00:38:29.507
C14.

464
00:38:30.814 --> 00:38:32.250
I've got that one, too.

465
00:38:37.342 --> 00:38:38.342
You okay?

466
00:38:39.953 --> 00:38:41.390
Yeah, I'm fine.

467
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:46.134
Try C14 and D5.

468
00:38:48.266 --> 00:38:49.266
Okay.

469
00:38:49.833 --> 00:38:50.921
Anything?

470
00:38:51.835 --> 00:38:52.923
No.

471
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:54.490
Distributor must be fried.

472
00:38:56.013 --> 00:38:57.754
It'll have to be hand-wired.

473
00:38:57.841 --> 00:39:01.192
Then spike my dopamine
levels or risk a coma.


474
00:39:01.279 --> 00:39:03.368
So we'll need a dopamine
agonist.


475
00:39:03.455 --> 00:39:04.891
You are correct.

476
00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:10.506
We'll be in good hands when you
take over.


477
00:39:14.031 --> 00:39:15.467
What are you talking about?

478
00:39:15.554 --> 00:39:17.556
Look, if you want what you're
after,


479
00:39:17.643 --> 00:39:19.515
just focus on getting
default in one piece.


480
00:39:20.864 --> 00:39:23.432
He'll need you to be the
face of the project anyway.


481
00:40:10.957 --> 00:40:12.220
- Hey.
- Hey.


482
00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:15.048
Where were you?

483
00:40:15.135 --> 00:40:16.224
The animal lab.

484
00:40:18.269 --> 00:40:20.358
Ethan, come here.

485
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.232
Look at me.

486
00:40:25.711 --> 00:40:26.711
How do you feel?

487
00:40:27.626 --> 00:40:28.626
I'm fine.

488
00:40:30.977 --> 00:40:32.501
Why were you at the animal lab?

489
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:36.287
We needed MDMA for the
reboot, intellect sent me.


490
00:40:36.374 --> 00:40:37.723
Intellect sent you?

491
00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:38.810
Yeah.

492
00:40:39.856 --> 00:40:41.292
Okay, we need to figure out

493
00:40:41.379 --> 00:40:44.121
who the hell these other
sections are.


494
00:40:49.431 --> 00:40:51.084
I was dancing with your
grandmother


495
00:40:51.171 --> 00:40:52.491
- at one point.
- Uh-huh, you did.


496
00:40:55.306 --> 00:40:57.221
There's some fireworks over
there, Ethan.


497
00:40:57.308 --> 00:40:58.828
Ethan, I promise that's not
gonna help.


498
00:40:58.875 --> 00:41:00.398
Just put it down, put it down.

499
00:41:00.485 --> 00:41:02.270
We're just gonna work through
this, okay?


500
00:41:02.357 --> 00:41:04.968
These herring bodies are
releasing doses of oxytocin,


501
00:41:05.055 --> 00:41:06.622
dopamine from the basal ganglia,
too,


502
00:41:06.709 --> 00:41:10.060
coming in at minute 54,
that's section nine.


503
00:41:10.147 --> 00:41:11.017
Euphoria.

504
00:41:11.104 --> 00:41:12.758
Oh my god!

505
00:41:12.845 --> 00:41:13.890
What?

506
00:41:13.977 --> 00:41:15.718
Appreciate you, ma'am.

507
00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:18.373
What do you want me to do?

508
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.288
I mean, need some
self-restraint, maybe.


509
00:41:20.375 --> 00:41:22.899
See this concentration
of serotonin transporters?


510
00:41:22.986 --> 00:41:25.205
Yeah, kicking in at minute six.

511
00:41:27.338 --> 00:41:28.731
Generalized anxiety.

512
00:41:29.819 --> 00:41:30.819
Section one.

513
00:41:32.343 --> 00:41:34.263
Certain cultures, it's
considered very masculine.


514
00:41:34.302 --> 00:41:36.304
Which cultures?

515
00:41:37.305 --> 00:41:38.654
Several of them.

516
00:41:52.929 --> 00:41:53.929
It's okay.

517
00:42:00.937 --> 00:42:01.938
I'm sorry.

518
00:42:05.376 --> 00:42:06.377
I'm sorry.

519
00:42:12.557 --> 00:42:16.431
Okay, so we have the nine
sections after default.


520
00:42:16.518 --> 00:42:18.433
Section one, anxiety.

521
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:22.132
Then 12 minutes in, section two,
anger.


522
00:42:23.394 --> 00:42:25.048
Section three is libido.

523
00:42:30.096 --> 00:42:31.881
Section four is unconscious.

524
00:42:31.968 --> 00:42:33.535
Right, all sections asleep.

525
00:42:33.622 --> 00:42:35.188
Which is the opposite of you,
default,


526
00:42:35.275 --> 00:42:37.582
all sections awake and in
balance.


527
00:42:37.669 --> 00:42:40.498
We know that section five is
intellect.


528
00:42:40.585 --> 00:42:42.413
And then section six...

529
00:42:45.503 --> 00:42:46.809
Calling him primitive.

530
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.986
Section seven, creative.

531
00:42:51.248 --> 00:42:54.382
And section nine, euphoria.

532
00:42:55.165 --> 00:42:56.819
So we just need section eight.

533
00:43:00.692 --> 00:43:02.128
Let's take a look at the tape.

534
00:43:08.047 --> 00:43:09.875
Okay, now section eight.

535
00:43:20.669 --> 00:43:21.931
Wait, stop.

536
00:43:29.286 --> 00:43:30.592
Look.

537
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.682
Aw, for fuck's sake.

538
00:43:33.769 --> 00:43:34.552
What?

539
00:43:34.639 --> 00:43:35.684
The notebook.

540
00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:40.863
I got a notebook in the
mail, it was one of my dad's.


541
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.125
Check, check the drawer.

542
00:43:47.609 --> 00:43:50.133
Had this equation.

543
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.222
Yes, this is all his
handwriting.


544
00:43:53.223 --> 00:43:54.223
Jesus.

545
00:43:55.443 --> 00:43:56.444
Yeah.

546
00:43:59.011 --> 00:44:00.230
This is mine.

547
00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:04.800
I don't remember any of this.

548
00:44:15.506 --> 00:44:16.551
Ethan.

549
00:44:17.508 --> 00:44:18.596
Ethan.

550
00:44:18.683 --> 00:44:20.772
Come on, try to focus.

551
00:44:33.132 --> 00:44:34.264
Can't breathe.

552
00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:36.353
I can't fucking breathe!

553
00:46:25.767 --> 00:46:27.420
Did you do this?

554
00:46:27.507 --> 00:46:29.466
No, my guess is
that it was section eight.


555
00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:31.207
If so, we need to move him.

556
00:46:31.294 --> 00:46:33.209
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.


557
00:46:33.296 --> 00:46:35.100
Alli, if you do that,
they'll take away the work.


558
00:46:35.124 --> 00:46:38.127
We'll never get it back, and
I'll probably go to prison.


559
00:46:39.868 --> 00:46:41.391
The R-10's almost ready.

560
00:46:41.478 --> 00:46:42.760
We wipe his memories and
we get him out of here


561
00:46:42.784 --> 00:46:44.437
like nothing happened.

562
00:46:44.524 --> 00:46:46.701
This is insane, this whole
fucking thing is insane.


563
00:46:46.788 --> 00:46:48.354
We have to protect the work.

564
00:46:48.441 --> 00:46:49.573
It's that important.

565
00:46:55.797 --> 00:46:59.104
If I do this, it's
not to protect the work.


566
00:47:00.715 --> 00:47:01.846
Let me get his head.

567
00:47:01.933 --> 00:47:03.239
- I got his head.
- Okay.


568
00:47:03.326 --> 00:47:04.719
How long before the R-10's
ready?


569
00:47:04.806 --> 00:47:06.851
A few more cycles.

570
00:47:06.938 --> 00:47:08.374
Can you manage this?

571
00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:14.642
You can't tell any of the
others, not even the default.


572
00:47:15.817 --> 00:47:17.993
I need him to focus on the
reintegration.


573
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:23.041
Malcolm will be fine, trust me.

574
00:48:00.035 --> 00:48:01.471
Ethan.

575
00:48:02.733 --> 00:48:05.083
You should never have left.

576
00:48:16.268 --> 00:48:17.966
But you'll get no credit here,

577
00:48:18.053 --> 00:48:19.794
and no support from me.

578
00:48:19.881 --> 00:48:22.100
You'll be doing this on your
own.


579
00:48:22.187 --> 00:48:24.624
Oh, so this is
about my consciousness work.


580
00:48:24.712 --> 00:48:25.712
Not yours.

581
00:48:26.975 --> 00:48:29.151
Everything generated here
belongs to the university.


582
00:48:29.238 --> 00:48:30.238
You mean you?

583
00:48:30.282 --> 00:48:31.762
That's how this works.

584
00:48:35.244 --> 00:48:38.987
Every thought, every half-baked
idea inside your head


585
00:48:39.074 --> 00:48:40.640
starts with me.

586
00:49:08.103 --> 00:49:11.584
They asked about your work
habits, I told the truth.


587
00:49:11.671 --> 00:49:13.238
Stop with the melodrama.

588
00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:15.458
I don't have time for
it, I don't have time.


589
00:49:16.807 --> 00:49:20.550
Blow out your candles.

590
00:49:20.637 --> 00:49:21.899
Paul!

591
00:49:21.986 --> 00:49:23.858
Can one of you just find Paul?

592
00:49:42.485 --> 00:49:43.485
Alli?

593
00:49:47.838 --> 00:49:48.838
Alli!

594
00:49:54.497 --> 00:49:57.195
Ethan, how are the headaches?

595
00:49:58.153 --> 00:50:00.155
They're worse for me, too.

596
00:50:00.242 --> 00:50:02.244
The highest functioning ones
are...


597
00:50:12.602 --> 00:50:14.473
Can I talk to you for a sec?

598
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.085
- You should get going.
- I know, but


599
00:50:17.172 --> 00:50:19.652
I need to confirm something.

600
00:50:45.026 --> 00:50:47.332
Ethan, how are the headaches?

601
00:50:48.594 --> 00:50:49.857
They're worse for me, too.

602
00:50:51.684 --> 00:50:54.339
The highest functioning
ones are burning out first.


603
00:50:54.426 --> 00:50:56.907
I have maybe two hours left.

604
00:50:58.126 --> 00:50:59.126
Creative, three.

605
00:51:00.693 --> 00:51:03.958
Then probably another six hours
for you and section eight.


606
00:51:04.045 --> 00:51:05.045
And so on.

607
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:09.441
I'd say we have less than 24
hours until full brain death.


608
00:51:10.355 --> 00:51:11.748
So I need you to listen,

609
00:51:13.402 --> 00:51:15.578
because I don't have much
more time to help you.


610
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:19.582
Alli said you remember the
notebook.


611
00:51:20.757 --> 00:51:23.542
This equation is not the
solution we thought it was.


612
00:51:23.629 --> 00:51:26.632
The equation we need
to do the reintegration


613
00:51:26.719 --> 00:51:29.722
is from the same proof,
and I'm working on it.


614
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:31.420
But in case I run out of time,

615
00:51:31.507 --> 00:51:33.117
you and Alli will have to figure
it out.


616
00:51:34.379 --> 00:51:36.555
By the way, I figured
out what was going on


617
00:51:36.642 --> 00:51:37.730
with those blackouts.

618
00:51:39.558 --> 00:51:42.605
Seems we were trying to
communicate with ourselves,


619
00:51:42.692 --> 00:51:45.347
even going so far as to
send ourself this notebook.


620
00:51:47.566 --> 00:51:48.886
It's not my place to opine on
why,


621
00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.573
but I think we saw what a
sad sack of shit we'd become,


622
00:51:55.705 --> 00:51:59.709
and decided with total
conviction that the solution


623
00:51:59.796 --> 00:52:01.929
was to fracture and reset our
mind.


624
00:52:05.193 --> 00:52:07.935
These were clearly moments
of heightened brain activity.


625
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:10.459
It's like psychedelics.

626
00:52:10.546 --> 00:52:12.200
- Did you watch the video?
- Yeah.


627
00:52:13.331 --> 00:52:14.463
It's total bullshit.

628
00:52:16.117 --> 00:52:17.945
If I had the answers
during these blackouts,


629
00:52:18.032 --> 00:52:20.121
you think I'd wanna do this to
myself?


630
00:52:21.078 --> 00:52:22.471
Ridiculous.

631
00:52:22.558 --> 00:52:24.212
Listening to a fucking fragment.

632
00:52:24.299 --> 00:52:25.699
He's got you running around
doing...


633
00:52:25.778 --> 00:52:27.215
Maybe you should take a step
back.


634
00:52:30.305 --> 00:52:31.654
It's all you, remember?

635
00:52:33.308 --> 00:52:34.700
You did this to yourself.

636
00:52:42.012 --> 00:52:43.274
Time's up.

637
00:52:46.147 --> 00:52:47.147
Checklist.

638
00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:53.284
Okay, I already did that.

639
00:52:55.417 --> 00:52:56.766
Check the coolant tank.

640
00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:03.860
Careful, it's cold.

641
00:53:05.166 --> 00:53:06.166
No it's not.

642
00:53:10.127 --> 00:53:11.127
It's not.

643
00:53:22.705 --> 00:53:24.315
Doesn't make sense.

644
00:53:24.402 --> 00:53:25.751
I changed it yesterday.

645
00:53:27.275 --> 00:53:28.275
Oh shit.

646
00:53:32.019 --> 00:53:33.411
Duct tape.

647
00:53:33.498 --> 00:53:34.760
- Seriously?
- Yeah.


648
00:53:44.944 --> 00:53:46.381
- Will that hold?
- Yeah.


649
00:53:48.426 --> 00:53:50.341
And if it doesn't?

650
00:53:50.428 --> 00:53:53.257
Best case, it doesn't power up.

651
00:53:53.344 --> 00:53:56.391
Worst case, it fries
whoever's in the chair.


652
00:53:59.394 --> 00:54:00.394
It's okay.

653
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:02.309
It'll be okay.

654
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.325
- Ethan?
- Huh?


655
00:54:17.412 --> 00:54:18.761
Get over here.

656
00:54:23.722 --> 00:54:24.767
Shit.

657
00:54:26.334 --> 00:54:27.465
That's intellect.

658
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:31.948
Let's see how far
he got on the equation.


659
00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.782
What the fuck?

660
00:54:47.616 --> 00:54:48.616
Ethan.

661
00:54:53.752 --> 00:54:55.319
Section eight again.

662
00:54:57.278 --> 00:54:58.322
Who is this guy?

663
00:55:02.718 --> 00:55:05.721
Ethan, remember those
scans we did at UT Dallas?


664
00:55:05.808 --> 00:55:07.853
Yeah, the antisocial ones?

665
00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:08.985
Right.

666
00:55:10.769 --> 00:55:14.121
See, this is all in line
with you, the default.


667
00:55:15.948 --> 00:55:18.951
But look at the activity
in the basal ganglia here.


668
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:22.650
Psychotic.

669
00:55:29.658 --> 00:55:32.878
He's gonna try to map himself
across my consciousness.


670
00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:40.711
What?

671
00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.063
Nothing.

672
00:55:44.151 --> 00:55:45.761
No, Alli, I know that look,
what is it?


673
00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:50.766
Ethan.

674
00:55:50.853 --> 00:55:53.551
Come on, try to push through it.

675
00:55:54.596 --> 00:55:55.596
Focus.

676
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.913
Every thought,
every half-baked idea


677
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.699
inside your head starts with me.

678
00:56:28.717 --> 00:56:29.717
Did it work?

679
00:56:39.249 --> 00:56:41.077
Can they push through you, too?

680
00:56:45.386 --> 00:56:47.126
What's your mother's maiden
name?


681
00:56:47.214 --> 00:56:48.606
My mother's maiden name?

682
00:56:48.693 --> 00:56:49.693
Yeah.

683
00:56:51.914 --> 00:56:53.568
Come on, seriously, what is it?

684
00:56:54.569 --> 00:56:55.570
Magill, why?

685
00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:58.094
Don't say it again.

686
00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:00.227
Section eight acts just like me,

687
00:57:00.314 --> 00:57:02.664
except he's picked back
up my smoking habit.


688
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:46.507
Look at me.

689
00:58:47.943 --> 00:58:50.337
How are you feeling, Ethan?

690
00:58:51.076 --> 00:58:52.426
That bad, huh?

691
00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:55.037
Body's getting hit with a lot.

692
00:58:56.168 --> 00:58:58.432
Like a new drug every six
minutes.


693
00:58:58.519 --> 00:59:00.303
Feels pretty shitty.

694
00:59:09.399 --> 00:59:10.835
Did you find the pages?

695
00:59:12.663 --> 00:59:14.535
Intellect didn't know, either.

696
00:59:15.449 --> 00:59:16.885
Now he's too sick to help.

697
00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:21.455
If section eight figures
out that equation...


698
00:59:22.412 --> 00:59:23.413
I know.

699
00:59:29.506 --> 00:59:31.552
I made a real mess of this,
haven't I?


700
00:59:40.125 --> 00:59:41.779
It's okay.

701
00:59:41.866 --> 00:59:42.866
I'm okay.

702
00:59:44.042 --> 00:59:46.305
How close were you
to the equation before?


703
00:59:46.393 --> 00:59:47.393
Close.

704
00:59:48.917 --> 00:59:52.921
But without the notebook, I'll
have to recreate the work.


705
01:00:58.769 --> 01:00:59.769
Shit.

706
01:01:20.138 --> 01:01:22.184
There's another equation.

707
01:01:27.319 --> 01:01:28.319
You've got five minutes.

708
01:01:28.364 --> 01:01:29.670
God damn it.

709
01:01:30.671 --> 01:01:32.716
It's on a piece of paper.

710
01:01:32.803 --> 01:01:34.849
I wrote it down during
one of my blackouts.


711
01:01:37.678 --> 01:01:39.680
I got it, I got it.

712
01:01:47.165 --> 01:01:48.165
Here.

713
01:01:49.516 --> 01:01:51.648
This is the one I used
before, from the notebook.


714
01:01:59.787 --> 01:02:02.398
It's different, close, but
different.


715
01:02:03.355 --> 01:02:05.270
This is the one we need.

716
01:02:05.357 --> 01:02:06.663
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.


717
01:02:07.795 --> 01:02:08.883
It's clear to me.

718
01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.757
Can you push through again?

719
01:02:13.844 --> 01:02:16.630
We've got 12 minutes now,
but we can use another six.


720
01:02:16.717 --> 01:02:19.197
No, the pain's too much.

721
01:02:20.242 --> 01:02:22.636
I also wonder what
happened to the other guy.


722
01:02:22.723 --> 01:02:24.812
Maybe you erased your anxiety.

723
01:02:24.899 --> 01:02:27.858
No, I can assure you, my
anxiety is alive and well.


724
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:31.558
Oh.

725
01:02:31.645 --> 01:02:32.471
Goddamn!

726
01:02:32.559 --> 01:02:33.559
Go, Alli.

727
01:02:33.603 --> 01:02:34.909
Piece of shit!

728
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:51.665
Why are you still here?

729
01:02:51.752 --> 01:02:52.753
Ethan.

730
01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.538
Come in the room now.

731
01:02:58.846 --> 01:03:00.674
Why the fuck are you here?

732
01:03:00.761 --> 01:03:01.675
Just calm down, let's just go
take a...


733
01:03:01.762 --> 01:03:03.894
No, shut the fuck up!

734
01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:06.288
You answer my fucking question,
what are you doing here?


735
01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:07.681
I'm just trying to help.

736
01:03:10.248 --> 01:03:11.248
Bullshit!

737
01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:13.163
Bullshit!

738
01:03:13.817 --> 01:03:15.210
There's an angle.

739
01:03:15.297 --> 01:03:17.125
There's always a fucking angle
with you.


740
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:21.303
It's that, huh?

741
01:03:22.652 --> 01:03:23.522
You're here for this, huh?

742
01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:24.785
No, Ethan.

743
01:03:24.872 --> 01:03:26.003
Ethan, stop it.

744
01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:27.091
Stop it.

745
01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:28.092
That what you want, huh?

746
01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:29.224
Ethan, don't!

747
01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:30.355
You take and you take!

748
01:03:30.442 --> 01:03:31.792
No, no, no, Ethan, stop, stop.

749
01:03:31.879 --> 01:03:33.204
- Let go of me.
- Just take it easy, Ethan,


750
01:03:33.228 --> 01:03:34.316
try to breathe.

751
01:03:34.403 --> 01:03:35.403
- It's okay.
- Let go!


752
01:03:45.806 --> 01:03:46.850
Fuck!

753
01:03:52.247 --> 01:03:53.247
Sorry.

754
01:03:58.819 --> 01:04:00.124
Motherfucker!

755
01:04:01.169 --> 01:04:03.345
I'm a big piece of shit!

756
01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:02.708
Alli.

757
01:05:06.016 --> 01:05:07.061
Alli.

758
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:56.588
God, that feels good.

759
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.203
Got the equation.

760
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:04.596
No shit, really?

761
01:06:04.683 --> 01:06:05.683
Yeah.

762
01:06:06.773 --> 01:06:07.774
You have it with you?

763
01:06:15.694 --> 01:06:16.739
Is it right?

764
01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:18.740
Yeah.

765
01:06:22.223 --> 01:06:24.138
Do not let anyone else have it.

766
01:06:29.883 --> 01:06:30.883
How's Malcolm?

767
01:06:31.536 --> 01:06:34.278
He's fine, sedated.

768
01:06:35.018 --> 01:06:36.018
Good.

769
01:06:38.848 --> 01:06:40.328
Do the reintegration first.

770
01:06:40.415 --> 01:06:41.982
After that, wipe his memory.

771
01:06:43.853 --> 01:06:44.853
So without you?

772
01:06:47.335 --> 01:06:48.989
It'll be default's
consciousness.


773
01:06:49.076 --> 01:06:51.208
He won't remember any of this,
will he?


774
01:06:52.296 --> 01:06:53.820
No, he won't.

775
01:06:55.169 --> 01:06:57.824
Just remind me you had no other
choice.


776
01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:00.827
I'll be pissed, but I'll get
over it.


777
01:07:02.524 --> 01:07:04.874
So how are we sure this
is gonna work this time?


778
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:10.749
It's just a matter of
inhibiting the right proteins.


779
01:07:14.188 --> 01:07:15.667
Should've worked the first time

780
01:07:15.754 --> 01:07:19.846
when I did it to myself
before, but as we know,


781
01:07:19.933 --> 01:07:24.981
drunk and impulsive, my
precision suffers.


782
01:07:31.988 --> 01:07:33.033
Why'd you do it?

783
01:07:34.686 --> 01:07:35.686
What?

784
01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.139
Try to wipe memories of my
father?


785
01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:40.344
Mm-hm.

786
01:07:42.869 --> 01:07:43.869
Resentment.

787
01:07:48.962 --> 01:07:50.398
I was with him when he died.

788
01:07:54.228 --> 01:07:55.490
He was so hungry.

789
01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.406
He kept begging for food,

790
01:07:58.493 --> 01:08:01.800
but the nurses wouldn't give him
any.


791
01:08:03.019 --> 01:08:04.542
They were afraid he'd choke.

792
01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.896
I was so angry.

793
01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:16.554
Next thing I know, I'm in
a hospital a week later,


794
01:08:17.425 --> 01:08:19.775
memories of my father still
intact.


795
01:08:25.955 --> 01:08:28.088
I wish I could've been more help
to you.


796
01:08:32.266 --> 01:08:33.745
We'll be fine.

797
01:08:35.008 --> 01:08:36.008
I know.

798
01:08:45.627 --> 01:08:48.325
Hey, I'm almost done with this
rewire.


799
01:08:48.412 --> 01:08:50.066
Would you power up the coils?

800
01:08:50.153 --> 01:08:52.068
Just wanna make sure these
connections are good.


801
01:08:52.155 --> 01:08:53.155
Yeah.

802
01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.161
What happened?

803
01:09:01.121 --> 01:09:02.121
Section two.

804
01:09:04.124 --> 01:09:05.125
Jesus.

805
01:09:05.995 --> 01:09:07.649
Alli, I'm sorry.

806
01:09:09.303 --> 01:09:10.043
Look, I don't...

807
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:11.130
I know.

808
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:16.963
Let's bring up the diagnostic.

809
01:09:28.061 --> 01:09:29.061
Hey.

810
01:09:32.108 --> 01:09:34.241
There's something else going on,
right?


811
01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:36.591
What do you mean?

812
01:09:36.678 --> 01:09:38.027
I don't know.

813
01:09:38.114 --> 01:09:39.986
It's hard playing catch-up every
hour.


814
01:09:40.812 --> 01:09:42.075
That's why I'm here.

815
01:09:55.218 --> 01:09:56.306
What is that?

816
01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.743
It's a song.

817
01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:00.832
Oh really, is that what that is?

818
01:10:04.184 --> 01:10:08.536
Okay, great, now give
me all of them at once.


819
01:10:08.623 --> 01:10:09.624
You sure?

820
01:10:09.711 --> 01:10:11.104
Yeah, what?

821
01:10:11.191 --> 01:10:13.671
You don't want
me to check your work?


822
01:10:13.758 --> 01:10:15.238
Come on, just do it.

823
01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:19.677
Nice.

824
01:10:20.635 --> 01:10:21.984
Looks like I got it.

825
01:10:22.071 --> 01:10:23.942
Should be good to go next hour.

826
01:10:25.683 --> 01:10:27.120
Why don't you go get some rest?

827
01:10:27.207 --> 01:10:28.208
No, I'm all right.

828
01:10:29.383 --> 01:10:30.949
You look exhausted.

829
01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.952
You looked in a mirror?

830
01:10:35.737 --> 01:10:37.260
Okay.

831
01:10:37.347 --> 01:10:39.871
I just mean, look, it's late.

832
01:10:39.958 --> 01:10:41.264
You should go lie down.

833
01:10:42.222 --> 01:10:43.222
I can finish.

834
01:10:47.749 --> 01:10:49.838
Don't worry, I have the time.

835
01:10:49.925 --> 01:10:52.014
I'll be out of here before the
shift.


836
01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.673
Alli, it's time to work!

837
01:13:27.474 --> 01:13:28.301
How the fuck
could you hide this from me?


838
01:13:28.388 --> 01:13:30.303
I didn't.

839
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:31.889
I showed you, and we decided
when the R-10's up and running,


840
01:13:31.913 --> 01:13:33.480
we'll wipe his memory and get
him out.


841
01:13:33.567 --> 01:13:35.327
You mean you showed
intellect and he decided.


842
01:13:35.395 --> 01:13:36.894
Ethan, if Malcolm remembers
any of it, we're done.


843
01:13:36.918 --> 01:13:38.311
Bullshit.

844
01:13:38.398 --> 01:13:40.487
You let my intellect use you.

845
01:13:40.574 --> 01:13:42.663
You've been using me for years.

846
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:45.579
And you don't give a shit
about anything but yourself.


847
01:13:46.884 --> 01:13:49.235
I did this to protect you,
asshole.


848
01:13:54.936 --> 01:13:56.242
Are we doing this or not?

849
01:13:57.547 --> 01:13:58.547
Ethan!

850
01:14:03.945 --> 01:14:05.381
Okay.

851
01:14:05.468 --> 01:14:07.383
I'm setting the wipe to the last

852
01:14:31.277 --> 01:14:33.627
Shut it off, shut it off!

853
01:14:40.982 --> 01:14:43.245
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

854
01:15:29.596 --> 01:15:30.596
Hello.

855
01:15:31.946 --> 01:15:32.946
Malcolm home?

856
01:15:33.948 --> 01:15:34.948
He is.

857
01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.080
Brain fried?

858
01:15:38.518 --> 01:15:40.607
He was lucid when I left.

859
01:15:40.694 --> 01:15:43.436
We should be okay, but I don't
know.


860
01:15:45.438 --> 01:15:46.526
What are you doing?

861
01:15:47.701 --> 01:15:48.701
Relaxing.

862
01:15:50.399 --> 01:15:51.966
Shouldn't you be in the lab?

863
01:15:53.707 --> 01:15:55.535
Figured I'd sit this one out.

864
01:16:00.888 --> 01:16:01.888
What are you doing?

865
01:16:02.585 --> 01:16:04.065
Getting my keys.

866
01:16:04.152 --> 01:16:05.651
I'm gonna get more coolant from
campus.


867
01:16:05.675 --> 01:16:07.982
How you gonna use it, anyway?

868
01:16:08.069 --> 01:16:09.549
The lines are shot, remember?

869
01:16:09.636 --> 01:16:11.681
Guess we'll
have to figure it out.


870
01:16:12.465 --> 01:16:13.988
Sounds great.

871
01:16:14.075 --> 01:16:15.357
Ethan, we had no idea what
section eight


872
01:16:15.381 --> 01:16:16.817
was gonna do to Malcolm.

873
01:16:16.904 --> 01:16:18.229
It was better for intellect to
handle.


874
01:16:18.253 --> 01:16:19.646
Well gee...

875
01:16:19.733 --> 01:16:21.735
Guess it's better when I'm in
the dark.


876
01:16:25.565 --> 01:16:26.957
Why are you even here, Alli?

877
01:16:27.915 --> 01:16:29.475
Well you botched your science
project...


878
01:16:29.525 --> 01:16:31.832
No, no, no, I mean
why'd you leave Stanford?


879
01:16:33.616 --> 01:16:35.226
You could have made a name for
yourself,


880
01:16:35.313 --> 01:16:36.358
why did you come back?

881
01:16:36.445 --> 01:16:37.707
You're wasting time.

882
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:42.625
They promise you my work?

883
01:16:48.501 --> 01:16:49.763
They did, didn't they?

884
01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:53.137
Figured I'd fuck it up
and it'd fall to you.


885
01:16:54.289 --> 01:16:57.988
You know, I expect my father
to fuck me over, not you.


886
01:16:59.599 --> 01:17:03.646
Ethan, your father
tried to give you credit.


887
01:17:04.908 --> 01:17:05.908
The board said no.

888
01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.523
He got sick and you finished
it, but it wasn't yours.


889
01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:13.395
And now that it is, you've shut
them out.


890
01:17:13.482 --> 01:17:15.310
So yeah, they asked me back.

891
01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:18.618
They weren't gonna trust this
project to an angry child.


892
01:17:22.926 --> 01:17:27.627
You know, I used to indulge
all this when we were together,


893
01:17:28.976 --> 01:17:31.195
but the world's not out to get
you, Ethan.


894
01:17:35.983 --> 01:17:38.072
I'm gonna go figure out the
coolant.


895
01:18:15.762 --> 01:18:20.027
And be careful, that's
where the noise comes in.


896
01:18:21.115 --> 01:18:22.115
You got it?

897
01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:37.913
Wait.

898
01:18:44.573 --> 01:18:45.573
There's some early work.

899
01:18:51.319 --> 01:18:52.363
Could be of interest.

900
01:19:06.464 --> 01:19:07.464
Ethan.

901
01:19:11.426 --> 01:19:12.906
You should never have left.

902
01:19:24.613 --> 01:19:25.875
Hey, it's me.

903
01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:29.052
Hope you're not avoiding me.

904
01:19:30.619 --> 01:19:32.752
I just wanted to see how you're
doing.


905
01:19:32.839 --> 01:19:33.990
I know it's tough being back
home,


906
01:19:34.014 --> 01:19:35.711
but I think it'll be good.

907
01:19:35.798 --> 01:19:40.934
Anyway, I hate the West Coast,
but it's beautiful here.


908
01:19:42.283 --> 01:19:45.416
I think we should talk things
over, so call me when you...


909
01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.645
Hey.

910
01:21:23.732 --> 01:21:25.212
Any, any troubles?

911
01:21:26.256 --> 01:21:28.128
No, I figured it out.

912
01:21:28.215 --> 01:21:30.696
Good, so we're almost all set,
then.


913
01:21:32.219 --> 01:21:35.788
Yeah, I just gotta rig the
coolant, and then the equation.


914
01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:37.703
We'll do the reintegration next
hour.


915
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:38.921
Fantastic.

916
01:21:39.008 --> 01:21:40.401
Hey, can I see it again?

917
01:21:42.055 --> 01:21:43.099
Yeah.

918
01:21:52.761 --> 01:21:53.761
Are you smoking?

919
01:22:07.471 --> 01:22:08.471
I got worried.

920
01:22:11.954 --> 01:22:13.260
Hey, Alli, it's fine.

921
01:22:14.087 --> 01:22:15.523
Just give me the equation.

922
01:22:17.351 --> 01:22:18.720
You pushed through,
section eight pushed through.


923
01:22:18.744 --> 01:22:20.963
Oh, what are you talking about?

924
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:22.748
What's my mother's maiden name?

925
01:22:23.923 --> 01:22:25.489
Don't be ridiculous.

926
01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:29.276
Give me the equation.

927
01:22:30.407 --> 01:22:31.757
Stop.

928
01:22:31.844 --> 01:22:32.627
Stop, stop.

929
01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:34.020
Alli, it's me.

930
01:22:34.107 --> 01:22:35.543
- Ethan.
- No!


931
01:23:54.752 --> 01:23:56.842
Alli, open up!

932
01:23:57.581 --> 01:23:59.018
We're running out of time.

933
01:24:00.019 --> 01:24:01.455
Alli, it's me!

934
01:24:02.543 --> 01:24:03.543
Open up!

935
01:24:08.984 --> 01:24:09.984
Alli!

936
01:24:10.986 --> 01:24:11.987
I feel real sick.

937
01:24:13.554 --> 01:24:15.599
I don't think I'm gonna last
much longer.


938
01:24:16.731 --> 01:24:17.731
Let me in.

939
01:24:19.952 --> 01:24:20.952
Please?

940
01:25:11.133 --> 01:25:12.961
- Get off me.
- Don't.


941
01:25:13.919 --> 01:25:14.789
Don't.

942
01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:15.876
Alli.

943
01:25:17.009 --> 01:25:18.009
Don't.

944
01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:48.954
Okay, got three more minutes.

945
01:25:54.872 --> 01:25:55.961
Nice work.

946
01:25:58.398 --> 01:26:00.791
Ethan, don't do this.

947
01:26:00.878 --> 01:26:02.489
I know you're still in there.

948
01:26:02.576 --> 01:26:05.057
Have you considered the
possibility this is me?


949
01:26:05.144 --> 01:26:06.754
Alli, I'm the real Ethan.

950
01:26:06.841 --> 01:26:08.843
It's confirmation bias.

951
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:10.125
If you knock on my door
a few minutes earlier,


952
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:11.802
you'd be helping me.

953
01:26:11.889 --> 01:26:14.980
Ethan, if you do this,
the whole you will be lost.


954
01:26:16.633 --> 01:26:18.026
If I'm right, then I have to.

955
01:26:19.158 --> 01:26:22.248
If I'm wrong, my choice is the
same.


956
01:26:30.908 --> 01:26:31.908
Wait.

957
01:26:47.751 --> 01:26:50.754
What?

958
01:26:51.886 --> 01:26:54.454
Did someone change the clock?

959
01:27:20.045 --> 01:27:21.220
Alli.

960
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:22.237
Hey.

961
01:28:22.324 --> 01:28:24.109
How are you feeling?

962
01:28:24.196 --> 01:28:25.196
Good.

963
01:28:30.941 --> 01:28:32.987
I want you to take over the
project.


964
01:28:37.992 --> 01:28:40.908
You know the work, you're
smarter than me.


965
01:28:40.995 --> 01:28:42.866
I just piss people off.

966
01:28:42.953 --> 01:28:43.998
Are you sure?

967
01:28:46.479 --> 01:28:49.090
I've spent too much
of my time being bitter.


968
01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:52.093
And the things I'd change, I
can't.


969
01:28:54.182 --> 01:28:57.011
I just know I don't wanna
do this by myself anymore.


970
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.887
Groundbreaking
work on temporal perception,


971
01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:08.109
I am proud to welcome Dr.
Fischer


972
01:29:08.196 --> 01:29:10.938
as our newest tenured professor.

973
01:29:14.898 --> 01:29:16.726
Thank you, Dean Myers.

974
01:29:16.813 --> 01:29:19.512
You're all familiar with Dr.
Ethan Kochar and his father,


975
01:29:19.599 --> 01:29:21.296
and the work they pioneered.

976
01:29:21.383 --> 01:29:23.951
It provided the basis for
our design of the R-11,


977
01:29:24.038 --> 01:29:25.909
which the university has
graciously allowed me


978
01:29:25.996 --> 01:29:27.955
to take the lead on.

979
01:29:28.042 --> 01:29:32.481
Dr. Kochar's R9-X allowed
us to map the neuropathways


980
01:29:32.568 --> 01:29:34.744
of memories and extract them.

981
01:29:34.831 --> 01:29:36.877
Similarly, the R-10 allowed us

982
01:29:36.964 --> 01:29:39.532
to map the neuropathways of
consciousness,


983
01:29:39.619 --> 01:29:42.709
giving insight into the
architecture of behavior.


984
01:29:44.058 --> 01:29:49.106
What we saw was both
surprising, and yet logical.


985
01:29:50.369 --> 01:29:52.980
Our personalities share
considerable real estate


986
01:29:53.067 --> 01:29:54.329
with our memories.

987
01:29:56.201 --> 01:29:58.507
But we still have a choice to
make.


988
01:29:59.682 --> 01:30:02.163
We get to decide how we
interpret our experiences


989
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:04.818
and how they effect who we are.

990
01:30:04.905 --> 01:30:05.905
Ethan!

991
01:30:08.038 --> 01:30:09.083
Malcolm.

992
01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:13.392
You just missed Dr. Fischer's
Christening.


993
01:30:14.219 --> 01:30:15.698
I know, I'm on my way now.

994
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:20.312
You've even got her doing
your lectures for you.


995
01:30:21.922 --> 01:30:23.793
Well, it's her project now.

996
01:30:33.934 --> 01:30:36.023
Don't wanna miss too much.

997
01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:38.199
All right, Malcolm, nice to
see you.


998
01:30:39.331 --> 01:30:41.420
We're not merely computers,

999
01:30:41.507 --> 01:30:43.596
time stamping information
our senses take in.


1000
01:30:43.683 --> 01:30:46.251
Nor are we adding machines
marking ones and zeroes


1001
01:30:46.338 --> 01:30:47.774
on a cerebral ledger.

1002
01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:51.734
There's something else.

1003
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:59.873
Traits that mark us,
intelligence, anger, love,


1004
01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:03.572
do not define us.

1005
01:31:03.659 --> 01:31:07.054
For in isolation, these
fragments are course,


1006
01:31:07.141 --> 01:31:08.838
even unrecognizable.

1007
01:31:11.406 --> 01:31:14.496
But when they coexist in
a single consciousness,


1008
01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:16.672
something emerges.

1009
01:31:18.457 --> 01:31:21.851
Something material, yet
immaterial.


1010
01:31:23.157 --> 01:31:25.420
Dare I even say immeasurable.

1011
01:31:28.467 --> 01:31:30.207
Something called self.
