00:04:10.536 --> 00:04:11.828
Oh, my!

2
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:13.661
See how beautiful you look!

3
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:16.161
Now listen to me carefully,

4
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.953
do as Jagan says.

5
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.245
Don't open your mouth.

6
00:04:25.328 --> 00:04:26.870
Just spread your legs.

7
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:36.911
Go in, sir. Enjoy!

8
00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:46.203
Please let me go!

9
00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.286
No.

10
00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:49.078
I want to go home.

11
00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:51.161
No...

12
00:05:02.995 --> 00:05:03.995
Hey, mister...

13
00:05:06.828 --> 00:05:08.828
Hey, you!

14
00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:21.203
Please open the door...

15
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:25.786
Mother!

16
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.995
Rashmibai!

17
00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:32.120
The girl has been crying
nonstop for three days.


18
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.828
Clients keep us up at night,
and she, in the day!


19
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:39.120
Madam, she's a 14 year old child.

20
00:05:39.495 --> 00:05:40.703
Don't keep hitting her.

21
00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:44.161
If she dies, you'll get arrested.

22
00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:47.078
So, what do I do?

23
00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:49.536
Send her back home?

24
00:05:50.245 --> 00:05:51.245
Don't do anything.

25
00:05:52.245 --> 00:05:53.370
Just call Gangubai.

26
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.453
What will that smart-ass do?

27
00:05:55.536 --> 00:05:59.953
If there's anyone who can get
the girl to give in, it's Gangubai.


28
00:06:00.036 --> 00:06:01.245
Think about it...

29
00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:06.120
She's right, madam.

30
00:06:06.828 --> 00:06:08.661
It's time you call Gangubai.

31
00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:12.828
Gangu, the infamous one!

32
00:06:18.453 --> 00:06:20.745
<i>Adept at changing colors,</i>
<i>like a chameleon!</i>


33
00:06:21.036 --> 00:06:23.286
<i>With one look she touches your heart.</i>

34
00:06:24.703 --> 00:06:29.036
<i>She scorns at love,</i>
<i>but she's soft-hearted.</i>


35
00:06:38.828 --> 00:06:40.036
Have we arrived?

36
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.453
We've run out of gas.

37
00:06:41.536 --> 00:06:42.411
RANI CHAAP
No. 1 ALCOHOL


38
00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:46.286
So thanks to you,
I will have to walk


39
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.120
and make a fool of myself.

40
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.453
Open the door.

41
00:06:54.328 --> 00:07:00.661
<i>She shines and glows</i>

42
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.661
<i>She shines and glows</i>

43
00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:07.286
<i>She shines...</i>

44
00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:08.911
Salaam, madam.

45
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:13.370
Namaskar, Gangubai.

46
00:07:16.995 --> 00:07:18.036
Greetings, madam.

47
00:07:20.911 --> 00:07:22.078
Gangubai!

48
00:07:23.328 --> 00:07:24.536
Over here.

49
00:07:24.745 --> 00:07:25.786
Rashmibai!

50
00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:28.036
I've come here after so long,
I forgot.


51
00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:31.286
What happened to you?
You were one wildcat.


52
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:35.161
-Now you look like a washed out rag.
-What to do, Gangubai?


53
00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:37.078
Business is slow,

54
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:39.286
and this new girl is also acting up!

55
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.120
But every time you come,

56
00:07:41.578 --> 00:07:42.661
things brighten up.

57
00:07:42.953 --> 00:07:45.328
You know what people say.

58
00:07:45.745 --> 00:07:48.036
Nights in Kamathipura
are always moonlit.


59
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.286
Ask me why?

60
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.453
Because Gangu lives there!

61
00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:56.078
Gangu was, is and will
always be shining like the moon.


62
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:59.411
-Where's the girl?
-Inside.


63
00:08:09.828 --> 00:08:11.245
Great, Rashmi.

64
00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:13.620
As expected from you...

65
00:08:14.495 --> 00:08:16.286
What could I do?
She's an animal.


66
00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:20.703
-She bit Mr. Jagan as well--
-Close the door and leave.


67
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.703
Fine, I'm leaving.

68
00:08:51.703 --> 00:08:52.703
Have some water.

69
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.453
I'm offering it with love.
Just drink it.


70
00:09:07.661 --> 00:09:08.828
What's your name?

71
00:09:09.453 --> 00:09:11.495
-They beat me a lot.
-Name?


72
00:09:13.078 --> 00:09:14.120
Madhu.

73
00:09:14.661 --> 00:09:15.745
I can't stay here.

74
00:09:15.828 --> 00:09:16.953
Madhu...

75
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.870
Once you enter Kamathipura,

76
00:09:21.578 --> 00:09:23.328
there's no going back.

77
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.328
Give me your hand.

78
00:09:27.495 --> 00:09:30.245
There was a girl like you
who went back home.


79
00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:33.370
Her family publicly hanged her to death.

80
00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:36.120
Who brought you here?

81
00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:38.578
Jameel...

82
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.286
How were you related to him?

83
00:09:41.036 --> 00:09:42.703
I was his wife.

84
00:09:46.286 --> 00:09:48.870
And he made you play
"wife" to the world?


85
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.036
Everyone here has the same story.

86
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.411
Every night is a wedding night
with a new husband.


87
00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.911
Where did you say you're from?

88
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.078
Ratnagiri.

89
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:03.745
I am from Kathiawar.

90
00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:06.161
I was a barrister's daughter,

91
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.036
Ganga Jagjeevandas Kathiawadi.

92
00:10:11.036 --> 00:10:13.953
I used to belong to a prestigious family.

<i>The dancing, twirling damsel</i>

94

Idiot! Where have you been?

125
00:12:01.245 --> 00:12:03.870
-Why didn't you come for <i>garba</i>?
-Relax.


126
00:12:04.453 --> 00:12:05.911
See what I've got for you.

127
00:12:07.078 --> 00:12:08.078
Whoa!

128
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.120
A ticket to Bombay!

129
00:12:10.453 --> 00:12:12.703
Your aunt spoke to the movie producer?

130
00:12:12.786 --> 00:12:13.661
Obviously!

131
00:12:13.745 --> 00:12:15.536
She's well-connected in Bombay.

132
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.078
They'll feature you
in a movie with Dev Anand.


133
00:12:22.536 --> 00:12:24.828
Hey, save all this drama for the movies.

134
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.161
Start packing.

135
00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:28.453
Okay, wait, let me inform my parents.

136
00:12:28.536 --> 00:12:30.286
Then you'll never be a movie star!

137
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.370
You think your father
will let you work in movies?


138
00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:35.495
-But Ramnik--
-You want to be a star?


139
00:12:36.036 --> 00:12:37.870
Want to make your parents proud?

140
00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:39.495
Do you love me?

141
00:12:40.578 --> 00:12:43.036
-Tell me, do you love me or not?
-Come on...


142
00:12:43.453 --> 00:12:45.536
You won't get this opportunity again.

143
00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:48.328
So, should I keep
the ticket or tear it up?


144
00:12:52.828 --> 00:12:54.245
You love me, right?

145
00:12:57.328 --> 00:12:58.370
Tell me.

146
00:13:02.703 --> 00:13:03.828
-Ramnik.
-Hmm.


147
00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:05.370
-Are you hungry?
-Hmm.


148
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:10.286
Want to eat <i>thepla</i> that my mom made?
There's sweet and spicy pickle too.


149
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.328
You'll love it.

150
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:15.411
Did you bring the money and jewels?

151
00:13:19.995 --> 00:13:21.245
Of course I did.

152
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:23.828
But...

153
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.953
We'll return everything to dad
once we're back.


154
00:13:27.036 --> 00:13:28.745
-Of course.
-Promise?


155
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.745
I promise.

156
00:13:33.203 --> 00:13:34.161
Damn!

157
00:13:34.245 --> 00:13:35.495
What happened?

158
00:13:37.161 --> 00:13:39.786
I've brought mom's cupboard keys with me.

159
00:13:40.036 --> 00:13:41.953
-What will happen now?
-Nothing.


160
00:13:42.036 --> 00:13:43.036
What do you mean?

161
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.453
Dad's new shirt is in the cupboard.
What will he wear for the prayers?


162
00:13:46.536 --> 00:13:48.120
He'll wear something else.

163
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.120
-Give me, I'll carefully--
-No!


164
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:52.786
I won't give my mother's keys to anyone!

165
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.161
Fine, keep them.

166
00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.286
-Ramnik...
-Yes?


167
00:13:59.203 --> 00:14:02.161
Along with the keys,
my mom must be searching for me too.


168
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.120
What if my parents never forgive me?

169
00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:08.161
Once your movies hit the theatres,

170
00:14:08.328 --> 00:14:11.495
not just your parents,
but all of Kathiawar will forgive you!


171
00:14:11.995 --> 00:14:14.036
Cheer up.
We're going to Bombay!


172
00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.578
<i>Ramnik, I'm hungry!</i>

173
00:14:32.661 --> 00:14:36.203
<i>-How far is your aunt's house?</i>
<i>-Relax. We're almost there.</i>


174
00:14:41.453 --> 00:14:43.703
-Ew, it's so dirty--
-Hush... Softly.


175
00:14:43.786 --> 00:14:45.786
Ew, your aunt lives here?

176
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.203
Not everyone is a barrister like your dad.

177
00:14:48.286 --> 00:14:49.495
Shut up, idiot!

178
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.786
Here comes a new one.

179
00:14:57.078 --> 00:14:58.036
Ramnik.

180
00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.286
I don't like it here.

181
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.495
These girls are dressed weirdly.

182
00:15:01.703 --> 00:15:03.161
Who sleeps during the day?

183
00:15:03.453 --> 00:15:04.370
Let's go back.

184
00:15:04.453 --> 00:15:08.120
My aunt teaches acting all night.
Everyone is resting now.


185
00:15:08.203 --> 00:15:10.161
I don't want to act. Let's go.

186
00:15:10.245 --> 00:15:11.911
Won't you become a movie star?

187
00:15:11.995 --> 00:15:13.495
How will you face your dad?

188
00:15:13.828 --> 00:15:15.120
Sit down, sit.

189
00:15:15.203 --> 00:15:17.453
I'll meet my aunt,
the producer must be here.


190
00:15:17.536 --> 00:15:19.078
-Be back soon, Ramnik.
-Yes.


191
00:15:23.995 --> 00:15:25.078
Hey,

192
00:15:25.328 --> 00:15:26.411
want some tea?

193
00:15:43.745 --> 00:15:45.203
Ramnik...

194
00:15:47.161 --> 00:15:48.328
Ganga?

195
00:15:48.745 --> 00:15:49.703
Yes.

196
00:15:49.786 --> 00:15:53.578
Ramnik sure has good taste.

197
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.536
Uh, Ramnik--

198
00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.745
I'm his aunt.

199
00:15:57.745 --> 00:15:58.620
You--

200
00:15:58.703 --> 00:15:59.786
And now yours too.

201
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.703
Aunt Sheela.

202
00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:04.578
Come here.

203
00:16:05.203 --> 00:16:06.245
Come.

204
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:08.245
Sit.

205
00:16:10.995 --> 00:16:12.870
Aunt Sheela, Ramnik--

206
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:14.828
He loves you a lot.

207
00:16:15.495 --> 00:16:18.995
He requested me to change your destiny.

208
00:16:20.036 --> 00:16:23.661
I said, let's... change your destiny.

209
00:16:25.328 --> 00:16:26.828
Ramnik had come in--

210
00:16:26.911 --> 00:16:29.620
Ramnik! Ramnik! Ramnik!

211
00:16:30.745 --> 00:16:33.078
Love is painful indeed.

212
00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:37.453
Your beloved is inside, unpacking.

213
00:16:39.078 --> 00:16:39.995
May I go?

214
00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:41.745
Of course.

215
00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:44.911
Ramnik?

216
00:16:47.536 --> 00:16:48.661
Ramnik?

217
00:16:51.786 --> 00:16:52.911
Aunt Sheela...

218
00:16:55.203 --> 00:16:57.828
No! Oh, no!

219
00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:00.911
Why did you shut the door?

220
00:17:01.411 --> 00:17:03.286
Listen... open the door, please!

221
00:17:03.703 --> 00:17:05.495
Please open the door!

222
00:17:06.745 --> 00:17:07.828
Aunt Sheela!

223
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:10.203
Someone has locked me in, Aunt Sheela!

224
00:17:10.495 --> 00:17:12.661
Ramnik, what kind of a joke is this!

225
00:17:18.286 --> 00:17:19.828
Ramnik, what...

226
00:17:26.495 --> 00:17:28.911
Aunt Sheela, the door...

227
00:17:29.245 --> 00:17:30.495
No!

228
00:17:31.828 --> 00:17:33.745
Open the door, please!

229
00:17:34.495 --> 00:17:36.828
Mom!

230
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:46.953
Here, have some water.

231
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.286
You haven't had anything in two days.
Drink this.


232
00:17:56.995 --> 00:17:58.370
I want to go home.

233
00:18:02.536 --> 00:18:04.661
And how will you face your family?

234
00:18:05.578 --> 00:18:06.703
Your beloved

235
00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:09.995
sold you off for Rs. 1,000.

236
00:18:11.536 --> 00:18:13.745
This is Sheela's brothel,

237
00:18:13.995 --> 00:18:16.661
and she's the boss here!

238
00:18:16.786 --> 00:18:18.078
Understood?

239
00:18:19.953 --> 00:18:23.578
You have two days to decide and comply.

240
00:18:24.328 --> 00:18:29.703
Or else, there are people here
who will use force and pay for it too.


241
00:18:38.911 --> 00:18:42.995
-Hey, mister!
-Take her!


242
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:50.495
<i>My body, my dreams and my trust were sold</i>
<i>for just Rs. 1,000 by someone I loved.</i>


243
00:18:52.953 --> 00:18:57.536
<i>Any glimmer of hope that I had</i>
<i>was killed in the next six days.</i>


244
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.911
<i>I was branded as one</i>
<i>of the whores of Kamathipura.</i>


245
00:19:04.495 --> 00:19:05.953
<i>How could I go back home?</i>

246
00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:09.953
<i>The brothel was my new home,</i>

247
00:19:10.703 --> 00:19:13.036
<i>and, I was a prostitute.</i>

248
00:19:31.078 --> 00:19:33.161
Hey! Enough with the makeup!

249
00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:34.745
Time for business.

250
00:19:35.578 --> 00:19:38.620
The clients are interested
in your body, not your face.


251
00:19:38.995 --> 00:19:40.495
Hurry up!

252
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.703
Hey, boy, come to me!

253
00:20:32.995 --> 00:20:33.995
Look at her.

254
00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:27.995
Come.

255
00:21:40.286 --> 00:21:42.953
Bloody hell! Someone light a candle!

256
00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.953
Ganga, Mr. Govind was very happy.

257
00:22:34.036 --> 00:22:36.495
He has left you a big tip.
Take this.


258
00:22:39.661 --> 00:22:40.995
Not Ganga.

259
00:22:43.578 --> 00:22:45.453
He has given me a new name...

260
00:22:48.495 --> 00:22:49.745
Gangu!

261
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:54.286
He also said that one day,
I will rule over Kamathipura.


262
00:22:57.161 --> 00:22:59.036
He has lost his mind.

263
00:22:59.703 --> 00:23:00.536
Here...

264
00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.911
your first earning.

265
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.953
What the hell are you doing?

266
00:23:08.495 --> 00:23:10.578
I'm cremating the old Ganga.

267
00:23:13.036 --> 00:23:14.953
Gangu is hungry, Aunt Sheela.

268
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.786
Where can I get some food?

269
00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.745
<i>Everything changed overnight.</i>

270
00:23:30.786 --> 00:23:33.036
<i>In no time, 
Ganga had been sold off.</i>

271
00:23:34.036 --> 00:23:37.245
<i>But Mr. Govind's words stayed with me.</i>

272
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.078
<i>I decided,</i>

273
00:23:39.161 --> 00:23:41.870
<i>I'd rule over this city one day.</i>

274
00:23:42.578 --> 00:23:43.620
<i>Soon,</i>

275
00:23:44.495 --> 00:23:47.161
<i>the pawns and their moves were mine.</i>

276
00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.703
Kamli... wear this,

277
00:23:49.786 --> 00:23:51.286
it'll look good on you.

278
00:23:51.703 --> 00:23:53.661
But this is gold.

279
00:23:53.745 --> 00:23:54.995
Darling, just wear it.

280
00:23:55.453 --> 00:23:56.953
Who gave you this?

281
00:23:57.036 --> 00:24:00.286
Gangu has many admirers
who shower her with gifts.


282
00:24:00.578 --> 00:24:02.078
Does Aunt Sheela know?

283
00:24:02.453 --> 00:24:04.578
She knows my worth.

284
00:24:04.953 --> 00:24:06.370
She's a smart woman.

285
00:24:06.911 --> 00:24:08.245
She won't take me on.

286
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.078
Wait and watch, Kamli.

287
00:24:10.411 --> 00:24:11.953
In the next five years,

288
00:24:12.536 --> 00:24:14.036
I'll buy this brothel...

289
00:24:14.953 --> 00:24:16.161
and Sheela as well!

290
00:24:18.453 --> 00:24:19.953
Done with your chitchat?

291
00:24:20.161 --> 00:24:22.495
There are clients waiting outside.

292
00:24:22.786 --> 00:24:24.578
Come on, get to work.

293
00:24:24.911 --> 00:24:26.453
We're not working today.

294
00:24:27.453 --> 00:24:31.078
They are going to watch
a movie with Gangu.


295
00:24:31.661 --> 00:24:33.370
Today I complete a year here.

296
00:24:33.453 --> 00:24:34.703
Great.

297
00:24:34.828 --> 00:24:37.245
While you girls go out and enjoy,

298
00:24:37.328 --> 00:24:39.536
am I to bear the loss?

299
00:24:39.995 --> 00:24:44.036
Profit and loss are a part of business,
Aunt Sheela.


300
00:24:45.203 --> 00:24:47.370
You entertain the clients tonight.

301
00:24:47.453 --> 00:24:50.661
Besides, every office
gives a weekly off too.


302
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.453
You should also take a day off.

303
00:24:54.495 --> 00:24:55.786
Let's go, girls.

304
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.453
It's time for aunt to get to work.

305
00:25:00.453 --> 00:25:01.536
Let's go!

306
00:25:10.661 --> 00:25:11.578
Come on.

307
00:25:13.203 --> 00:25:14.495
See you.

308
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.661
Gangu? Where are you going?

309
00:25:36.745 --> 00:25:37.953
Come.

310
00:25:40.078 --> 00:25:44.078
Hey, beautiful, let's go have some fun.

311
00:25:44.745 --> 00:25:46.995
I'll take you to the "night show". Come.

312
00:25:47.828 --> 00:25:48.911
You...

313
00:25:52.411 --> 00:25:54.453
Gangu... What's wrong?

314
00:25:54.536 --> 00:25:56.870
Taking me to the night show, huh?

315
00:25:56.953 --> 00:25:58.620
Let him go, Gangu.

316
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.245
Can't we enjoy our day off in peace?

317
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:06.911
Let's go.
The movie is about to start.


318
00:26:16.911 --> 00:26:18.745
Sister got angry.

319
00:26:18.828 --> 00:26:20.120
Get lost.

320
00:26:21.661 --> 00:26:24.036
What a total waste of our evening!

321
00:26:24.578 --> 00:26:27.870
You wasted your money,
and then fighting with that man...


322
00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:29.745
How does it matter?

323
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.953
I saw Dev Anand.

324
00:26:32.036 --> 00:26:33.786
Now I'll sleep peacefully.

325
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:34.953
Gangu!

326
00:26:35.036 --> 00:26:36.661
Come on, act like Dev Anand.

327
00:26:36.745 --> 00:26:37.620
No.

328
00:26:37.703 --> 00:26:40.411
-Come on.
-Just let me sleep.


329
00:26:40.495 --> 00:26:41.453
Gangu!

330
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.245
I want to send a letter.
Please write it.


331
00:26:44.328 --> 00:26:45.828
You have so many lovers,

332
00:26:46.036 --> 00:26:47.578
who all should I write to?

333
00:26:49.245 --> 00:26:50.536
To my father.

334
00:26:57.036 --> 00:26:58.411
What should I write?

335
00:26:58.495 --> 00:27:00.036
Write whatever you want.

336
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:02.078
Dear father,

337
00:27:02.911 --> 00:27:06.620
Firstly, I want to seek your forgiveness.

338
00:27:08.036 --> 00:27:10.161
-For--
-For hurting you.


339
00:27:12.203 --> 00:27:14.870
Consider it my stupidity and forgive me.

340
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:19.161
I often think...

341
00:27:21.245 --> 00:27:23.495
If only before leaving home,

342
00:27:24.786 --> 00:27:25.953
I had seen you...

343
00:27:28.161 --> 00:27:29.745
You'd have stopped me.

344
00:27:32.536 --> 00:27:34.411
But don't worry about me, Dad.

345
00:27:36.536 --> 00:27:37.870
I am happy.

346
00:27:39.828 --> 00:27:41.161
I am doing well.

347
00:27:43.911 --> 00:27:44.870
Yours...

348
00:27:48.536 --> 00:27:49.703
Ganga.

349
00:27:58.911 --> 00:27:59.995
Madam.

350
00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:01.786
A client is asking for Gangu.

351
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.536
Which customer comes at 4 in the morning?

352
00:28:04.995 --> 00:28:06.578
Hold this.

353
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:09.786
She's sleeping.
Ask him to come tomorrow.


354
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.078
He has come all the way here
only for Gangu.


355
00:28:12.245 --> 00:28:14.245
Oh! Ask him to pay double the amount.

356
00:28:14.328 --> 00:28:17.578
Forget the money,
something's not right about this guy.


357
00:28:17.661 --> 00:28:19.661
-Should I throw him out?
-Actually...


358
00:28:20.411 --> 00:28:21.411
Let him in.

359
00:28:22.161 --> 00:28:24.203
He is perfect for Gangu.

360
00:28:25.661 --> 00:28:26.995
Gangu.

361
00:28:36.036 --> 00:28:37.703
Gangu. Wake up.

362
00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:40.661
-What do you want?
-There's a new client for you.


363
00:28:41.995 --> 00:28:44.411
-At this hour?
-Do we even have fixed hours?


364
00:28:45.161 --> 00:28:46.078
Look,

365
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:48.453
he's paying twice the amount for you.

366
00:28:48.578 --> 00:28:50.036
We'll earn a lot.

367
00:28:50.286 --> 00:28:52.953
Come on, go and get it over with.

368
00:29:04.495 --> 00:29:06.120
Not like this...

369
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.495
Here's the water.

370
00:29:11.078 --> 00:29:13.286
I'm hungry, Dawood.

371
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.620
Get me an egg roll.

372
00:29:14.703 --> 00:29:15.995
At this hour? From where?

373
00:29:16.078 --> 00:29:17.703
You'll find it on Grant Road.

374
00:29:17.786 --> 00:29:19.536
They'll take a couple of hours.

375
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.453
-I have a bad feeling about this man.
-Just go.


376
00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.911
I'm here to look after it, you go.

377
00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:27.328
Madam, you're just--

378
00:29:27.411 --> 00:29:29.328
Listen, make it quick.

379
00:29:30.203 --> 00:29:31.286
Moron.

380
00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.495
Aunt Sheela...

381
00:29:45.703 --> 00:29:46.911
Aunt Sheela!

382
00:29:48.078 --> 00:29:49.536
Aunt Sheela!

383
00:29:50.203 --> 00:29:51.703
Aunt Sheela!

384
00:29:52.703 --> 00:29:54.828
Why do you need Sheela?

385
00:29:55.911 --> 00:29:58.036
We're here together now.

386
00:30:05.911 --> 00:30:07.328
Aunt Sheela!

387
00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:09.745
Aunt Sheela!

388
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.453
Aunt Sheela!

389
00:30:24.286 --> 00:30:27.245
This is such a nuisance!

390
00:30:27.328 --> 00:30:28.911
-Gangu!
-Aunt Sheela!


391
00:30:32.745 --> 00:30:33.661
Aunt?

392
00:30:33.745 --> 00:30:36.161
-What's going on?
-Bloody scoundrel!


393
00:30:36.245 --> 00:30:37.786
Open the door!

394
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.661
Are you going to kill her?

395
00:30:39.745 --> 00:30:41.620
Why is Gangu screaming?

396
00:30:41.703 --> 00:30:44.161
Don't just bang on the door!
Do something!


397
00:30:44.328 --> 00:30:45.578
Where are your men?

398
00:30:45.661 --> 00:30:46.620
Call Dawood.

399
00:30:46.703 --> 00:30:49.370
Where will I find him?
He must be lying somewhere drunk.


400
00:30:49.453 --> 00:30:52.203
Go find him.
Open the door!


401
00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:54.328
Aunt...

402
00:30:54.536 --> 00:30:56.828
-Open the bloody door!
-Want to go out?


403
00:30:56.911 --> 00:30:59.578
I'm right here, my child, don't worry.

404
00:30:59.661 --> 00:31:01.203
Oh, poor Ganga!

405
00:31:01.286 --> 00:31:02.286
Aunt...

406
00:31:02.911 --> 00:31:06.536
You want to go to her?

407
00:31:10.245 --> 00:31:11.411
Go!

408
00:31:16.161 --> 00:31:18.203
She's got 15 stitches on her stomach

409
00:31:18.328 --> 00:31:19.578
and four on her lips.

410
00:31:19.828 --> 00:31:21.370
He has broken her limbs too.

411
00:31:21.453 --> 00:31:22.536
You're our madam.

412
00:31:22.786 --> 00:31:24.745
We are your responsibility.

413
00:31:24.828 --> 00:31:27.245
In spite of you being here,
she's as good as dead.


414
00:31:27.328 --> 00:31:28.870
These wounds will heal,

415
00:31:29.078 --> 00:31:31.036
but she'll live with this trauma forever.

416
00:31:32.453 --> 00:31:34.245
What can I say, my dear?

417
00:31:35.453 --> 00:31:39.411
In our profession,
we often come across such monsters.


418
00:31:40.911 --> 00:31:45.120
Just like how soldiers face the risk
of getting shot in the battlefield,


419
00:31:46.036 --> 00:31:47.620
we have risks too.

420
00:31:47.703 --> 00:31:49.203
Are you serious?

421
00:31:49.286 --> 00:31:51.328
Only you guys know it all, is it?

422
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.286
Don't you worry, my dear.

423
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.953
I've prayed for your well-being
and donated to the poor.


424
00:31:58.036 --> 00:31:59.245
Here, eat this.

425
00:31:59.661 --> 00:32:02.703
If you had gone to the police
instead of putting up an act,


426
00:32:02.786 --> 00:32:04.286
the monster would've been arrested.

427
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.995
If I had gone to the police,
they'd have arrested all of us.


428
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.286
So what?

429
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.286
The scoundrel would be punished too!

430
00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.370
-What good has come from sitting here--
-Talk softly!


431
00:32:14.453 --> 00:32:16.078
-This is a hospital!
-Heard?


432
00:32:16.161 --> 00:32:17.120
Heard what?

433
00:32:17.203 --> 00:32:20.286
Is setting a price on us
your only responsibility?


434
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:21.786
I will set a price.

435
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.995
Not once, but every bloody time!

436
00:32:24.536 --> 00:32:27.370
I've paid through
the nose to buy you girls.


437
00:32:27.745 --> 00:32:29.911
Your family sold you off.

438
00:32:29.995 --> 00:32:31.911
I am the one who raised you.

439
00:32:32.245 --> 00:32:35.203
And this is how you repay me?

440
00:32:38.328 --> 00:32:40.036
My bad luck...

441
00:32:41.578 --> 00:32:43.495
I've done so much for you girls,

442
00:32:44.703 --> 00:32:46.328
yet I get no respect.

443
00:32:48.495 --> 00:32:49.828
Nobody cares.

444
00:32:56.078 --> 00:33:00.078
These people are treating
the hospital like a brothel.


445
00:33:00.161 --> 00:33:04.661
Smoking, cussing, yelling all the time...

446
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:08.745
This dump is the right place for them.

447
00:33:08.995 --> 00:33:11.286
I'll come at 8 o'clock
to change the dressing.


448
00:33:15.703 --> 00:33:19.745
Shaukat Abbas Khan, that <i>Pathan</i>,

449
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.953
with four murder and three rape cases.

450
00:33:23.036 --> 00:33:25.953
-He is Rahim Lala's man.
-Lala is the king of Bombay.


451
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:28.286
Even the cops here fear him.

452
00:33:28.661 --> 00:33:30.578
They say he's a man of principles.

453
00:33:30.661 --> 00:33:31.995
He is genuine.

454
00:33:32.745 --> 00:33:34.786
I also heard that he's quite a looker.

455
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.536
Now that you know
his name, are you happy?

456
00:33:38.245 --> 00:33:40.245
Want a drag?

457
00:34:29.203 --> 00:34:30.411
Mr. Rahim.

458
00:34:31.786 --> 00:34:32.911
Mr. Rahim.

459
00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.995
I want to talk to you.

460
00:34:47.078 --> 00:34:48.203
Hey, you!

461
00:34:49.995 --> 00:34:52.120
I'm here to seek justice.

462
00:34:53.328 --> 00:34:54.453
Take her upstairs.

463
00:34:54.911 --> 00:34:56.411
I'll come after my prayers.

464
00:35:04.745 --> 00:35:06.411
It'll be done.

465
00:35:07.536 --> 00:35:09.536
I've said it once.
No need to repeat.


466
00:35:09.745 --> 00:35:11.120
Namaste, sir.

467
00:35:12.453 --> 00:35:14.870
-Assalamu alaikum.
-Alaikum assalam.


468
00:35:24.995 --> 00:35:26.245
Tell me...

469
00:35:27.745 --> 00:35:29.286
I am Gangu,

470
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.328
from the brothel street.

471
00:35:32.245 --> 00:35:33.245
What do you want?

472
00:35:34.036 --> 00:35:36.536
I've heard about
your principles and honesty.


473
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.328
That's why I thought of--

474
00:35:38.411 --> 00:35:40.370
I have enough people who praise me.

475
00:35:40.536 --> 00:35:41.911
What do you want?

476
00:35:43.995 --> 00:35:45.620
You worship your business,

477
00:35:45.828 --> 00:35:46.786
and so do we.

478
00:35:47.995 --> 00:35:50.120
What if someone disrespects it?

479
00:35:51.078 --> 00:35:54.911
Those traitors will be punished by God!

480
00:35:55.703 --> 00:35:57.245
And that is why I'm here.

481
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:03.495
Shaukat Abbas Khan,

482
00:36:04.453 --> 00:36:05.661
he works for you.

483
00:36:06.078 --> 00:36:07.995
I have many men who work for me...

484
00:36:08.536 --> 00:36:09.870
and against me as well.

485
00:36:11.828 --> 00:36:13.495
I don't know them all by name.

486
00:36:13.786 --> 00:36:16.120
He used to work at our warehouse
in Antop Hill.


487
00:36:16.203 --> 00:36:17.911
He's been missing for a while.

488
00:36:17.995 --> 00:36:19.536
He has wronged me.

489
00:36:20.828 --> 00:36:22.120
I've suffered great loss.

490
00:36:22.495 --> 00:36:24.078
You expect him
to settle scores for whores?


491
00:36:24.161 --> 00:36:25.786
Not to settle our scores,

492
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.578
but to give me justice.

493
00:36:31.453 --> 00:36:32.620
<i>Salaam alaikum, sir.</i>

494
00:36:34.745 --> 00:36:37.411
<i>Hello, sir... Hello?</i>

495
00:36:40.995 --> 00:36:44.036
It wouldn't hurt as much
if this was just another blow.


496
00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:46.161
But this has affected my business.

497
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:50.703
And I'm sure you know
what a loss in my business means.


498
00:36:55.911 --> 00:36:58.453
Tell Bilaal to stand guard
outside her brothel.


499
00:37:00.411 --> 00:37:03.411
If Shaukat returns, inform Bilaal.

500
00:37:04.911 --> 00:37:06.120
I'll take care of the rest.

501
00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:08.328
Liyaqat, drop her home,

502
00:37:08.745 --> 00:37:11.078
-and give her money for treatment--
-No, sir!


503
00:37:12.745 --> 00:37:14.411
It's not about money.

504
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.078
Accept it as a gift from your brother.

505
00:37:20.078 --> 00:37:21.120
Go.

506
00:37:35.411 --> 00:37:37.703
Come on...

507
00:37:39.745 --> 00:37:42.370
Come on!

508
00:37:47.745 --> 00:37:49.661
Hey, handsome, come up.

509
00:37:50.495 --> 00:37:54.036
-Come on!
-Bilaal, my love, why so upset?


510
00:37:54.411 --> 00:37:58.411
Ever since Lala sent Bilaal here,
the girls have been lusting over him.


511
00:37:58.995 --> 00:38:01.703
Leave him alone.
Come inside.


512
00:38:03.328 --> 00:38:04.328
Gangu...

513
00:38:05.453 --> 00:38:07.328
These girls have fallen for him.

514
00:38:07.578 --> 00:38:11.286
Why do it for free
when you can get paid?

515
00:38:15.911 --> 00:38:16.953
Gangu.

516
00:38:17.036 --> 00:38:19.078
-Hmm?
-The <i>Pathan</i> is here.


517
00:38:27.036 --> 00:38:29.703
-What do you want to do?
-What do you mean?


518
00:38:30.078 --> 00:38:31.328
You are our madam.

519
00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:33.411
Ask that monster to leave.

520
00:38:33.536 --> 00:38:37.495
After everything that he did, you think
we'll send Gangu back to him? Never!


521
00:38:37.578 --> 00:38:39.536
And send her to the hospital again?

522
00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:40.578
Aunt Sheela...

523
00:38:41.578 --> 00:38:42.745
Ask for four times the price.

524
00:38:43.828 --> 00:38:46.078
-He's ready to pay.
-See...


525
00:38:46.995 --> 00:38:49.995
You never miss an opportunity
to make money.


526
00:38:51.786 --> 00:38:53.411
Go. I'll be there.

527
00:38:54.286 --> 00:38:55.453
Come fast.

528
00:38:56.911 --> 00:38:58.411
Have you lost your mind?

529
00:38:58.495 --> 00:39:01.161
-The witch is after money. Risking your--
-Kamli.


530
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:02.870
Inform Lala.

531
00:39:02.953 --> 00:39:04.453
-But Gangu--
-Go, Kamli.


532
00:39:06.745 --> 00:39:07.578
Bilaal?

533
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:09.161
Where did he go?

534
00:39:09.286 --> 00:39:11.620
Fool, you scared him away!
Let's go.


535
00:39:11.703 --> 00:39:14.328
-He's probably at the tea stall.
-Bilaal!


536
00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:17.328
Banwari! What are you staring at!
Go call him!


537
00:39:17.745 --> 00:39:18.870
Bilaal!

538
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:28.995
Bilaal!

539
00:39:29.078 --> 00:39:30.203
Bilaal, listen!

540
00:39:30.286 --> 00:39:31.370
Go and call Lala.

541
00:39:31.453 --> 00:39:33.286
The <i>Pathan</i> is here.
Hurry up.


542
00:39:36.495 --> 00:39:38.328
Gangu, Bilaal has gone to bring Lala.

543
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:39.370
Gangu, wait...

544
00:39:39.995 --> 00:39:41.120
listen to me.

545
00:39:45.661 --> 00:39:49.703
What are you girls staring at?

546
00:39:50.828 --> 00:39:53.370
Come on, get to work.

547
00:39:53.828 --> 00:39:54.953
Go!

548
00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:01.286
Oh!

549
00:40:01.786 --> 00:40:04.203
All the scars I gave you are gone.

550
00:40:04.411 --> 00:40:06.286
I'll give you some more this time.

551
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.578
It'll be fun.

552
00:40:08.578 --> 00:40:10.203
Beating up a woman?

553
00:40:10.745 --> 00:40:11.828
You're not a man.

554
00:40:31.536 --> 00:40:33.370
Where is he?
Where is Shaukat?


555
00:40:35.911 --> 00:40:36.870
Shaukat!

556
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:37.995
Open the door!

557
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.995
Open the door, scumbag!

558
00:40:55.161 --> 00:40:56.495
Come out, Shaukat.

559
00:40:56.578 --> 00:40:58.411
Open the damn door...

560
00:41:00.036 --> 00:41:00.870
What's wrong?

561
00:41:00.953 --> 00:41:02.328
Come on.
You pervert!


562
00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:03.411
What's the matter?

563
00:41:03.495 --> 00:41:06.495
Leave me!
Where are you taking me?


564
00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.370
Where are you taking me!

565
00:41:09.828 --> 00:41:11.286
Come, you moron!

566
00:41:19.245 --> 00:41:20.786
Rahim Lala, let me go...

567
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:22.453
Forgive me, please.

568
00:42:04.745 --> 00:42:06.161
Give me my money.

569
00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.203
Give me my rightfully earned money
right now!


570
00:42:16.536 --> 00:42:17.786
Motherfucker!

571
00:42:35.245 --> 00:42:36.453
Take it easy.

572
00:42:37.995 --> 00:42:40.245
You're bedridden so soon, Sheela?

573
00:42:40.578 --> 00:42:43.495
When did you guys ever
let me leave my bed?


574
00:42:45.411 --> 00:42:47.578
I hope you'll make me meet Gangu today.

575
00:42:48.328 --> 00:42:50.745
Ever since Lala called her his sister,

576
00:42:50.828 --> 00:42:52.203
she does as she pleases.

577
00:42:52.411 --> 00:42:55.036
She is behaving like the new madam here.

578
00:42:55.703 --> 00:42:57.578
I think my time is up.

579
00:42:57.661 --> 00:42:59.495
Time up? Don't be silly.

580
00:43:03.453 --> 00:43:04.495
Called for me?

581
00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.495
Govind is here for you.

582
00:43:07.411 --> 00:43:08.953
I don't feel like it today.

583
00:43:09.828 --> 00:43:11.203
What do you mean?

584
00:43:11.286 --> 00:43:15.036
It means, I'm running a fever.
Check it if you don't believe me.


585
00:43:17.245 --> 00:43:18.911
Yes, yes, you do have a fever.

586
00:43:18.995 --> 00:43:20.411
Go get some rest, dear.

587
00:43:20.495 --> 00:43:21.828
-Go.
-Hmm.


588
00:43:22.286 --> 00:43:24.370
I'll wait for it to go down...

589
00:43:24.453 --> 00:43:25.328
your fever.

590
00:43:25.411 --> 00:43:31.870
<i>All plans have backfired!</i>

591
00:43:34.036 --> 00:43:40.120
-Sheela, you need rest.
-Yes...


592
00:43:40.245 --> 00:43:42.578
-Should I give you a massage?
-Oh, yes.


593
00:44:05.203 --> 00:44:06.495
Gangu!

594
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:09.286
Gangu!

595
00:44:10.578 --> 00:44:12.828
Why are you screaming
so early in the morning?


596
00:44:12.953 --> 00:44:14.286
Aunt Sheela...

597
00:44:14.703 --> 00:44:15.703
Come quickly.

598
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.286
Thinking of money
until her very last breath.


599
00:44:31.911 --> 00:44:34.370
We've earned this.
Distribute it among yourselves.


600
00:44:44.953 --> 00:44:46.411
Kamli, take her away

601
00:44:46.786 --> 00:44:47.953
right now.

602
00:44:48.703 --> 00:44:51.745
And tell her henchmen
not to come to work from tomorrow.


603
00:44:52.453 --> 00:44:54.411
We will take care of ourselves now.

604
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:07.120
-Gangu!
-Hmm.


605
00:45:07.203 --> 00:45:08.328
Shinde.

606
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.411
The scoundrel is here.

607
00:45:10.495 --> 00:45:12.703
It's a tricky situation.
Can you manage?


608
00:45:12.786 --> 00:45:15.203
Don't worry, I will.

609
00:45:16.661 --> 00:45:17.786
Namaste, madam.

610
00:45:18.495 --> 00:45:19.828
-Sit...
-Sorry?


611
00:45:20.328 --> 00:45:21.661
She wants you to sit.

612
00:45:21.745 --> 00:45:22.828
Oh...

613
00:45:24.495 --> 00:45:26.036
No, it's okay.

614
00:45:26.495 --> 00:45:29.995
This room feels so empty
without Ms. Sheela.


615
00:45:30.078 --> 00:45:33.786
Shinde, we didn't call you here to mourn.

616
00:45:34.203 --> 00:45:36.745
Your men have been asking
for a lot of bribe.


617
00:45:36.828 --> 00:45:40.578
And you guys end up
taking 40 percent of our earnings!


618
00:45:40.661 --> 00:45:41.911
It's getting difficult.

619
00:45:41.995 --> 00:45:43.911
There's a new officer
at the police station.


620
00:45:43.995 --> 00:45:46.245
He is very stubborn
and does as he pleases.


621
00:45:46.495 --> 00:45:49.078
Great, you keep asking for bribes

622
00:45:49.161 --> 00:45:51.328
and our landlord has increased the rent.

623
00:45:51.578 --> 00:45:54.620
We've lost our madam
and you want to bring us to the streets.


624
00:45:54.703 --> 00:45:57.495
No, the neighborhood
has called for a committee meeting.


625
00:45:57.578 --> 00:45:59.745
These government issues take time...

626
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:01.286
-It will be done.
-Kamli?


627
00:46:01.453 --> 00:46:02.870
When will Mr. Rahim come?

628
00:46:03.036 --> 00:46:04.703
Why disturb him?

629
00:46:05.036 --> 00:46:07.870
I'll sort it out.
Please be patient.


630
00:46:09.786 --> 00:46:12.620
After all...
you are the new madam now.


631
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:17.620
I pray that Ms. Sheela's
gentle soul goes to heaven.


632
00:46:18.578 --> 00:46:19.870
Or hell.

633
00:46:21.495 --> 00:46:23.620
Get the job done in 15 days, Shinde.

634
00:46:23.828 --> 00:46:24.786
I will...

635
00:46:32.536 --> 00:46:36.370
Well done, what a performance!
You brought a cop to his knees today!


636
00:46:37.328 --> 00:46:38.953
This neighborhood too
will fall on its knees.


637
00:46:43.161 --> 00:46:45.203
"There are a thousand yearnings

638
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.828
that afflict my heart..."

639
00:46:47.911 --> 00:46:49.036
Gangu!

640
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:51.078
We want to talk to you.

641
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:54.120
What is it?
Everyone together in my room?


642
00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.870
Going on a strike?

643
00:46:55.953 --> 00:46:57.161
No.

644
00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:00.411
We have a gift for you.

645
00:47:01.161 --> 00:47:02.370
Gift? For what?

646
00:47:02.453 --> 00:47:06.453
You're the only person in Kamathipura
who understands our plight,


647
00:47:06.536 --> 00:47:08.911
thinks of our welfare,
fights for our rights.


648
00:47:08.995 --> 00:47:11.495
And only a good madam
would do all this.


649
00:47:11.578 --> 00:47:14.870
You are making me
a "madam" at 27, huh?


650
00:47:15.661 --> 00:47:17.870
If I wear a
white sari in my youth,

651
00:47:17.953 --> 00:47:19.453
all my clients will run away.

652
00:47:19.536 --> 00:47:20.745
Gangu,

653
00:47:21.453 --> 00:47:24.120
you don't need to satisfy any client now.

654
00:47:24.203 --> 00:47:25.578
Just look after us.

655
00:47:25.661 --> 00:47:27.286
When you wear this white sari,

656
00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:29.036
you'll look like a politician!

657
00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.703
Right! Enough of all
this politician, election


658
00:47:32.786 --> 00:47:33.786
and praising.

659
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:34.828
Get to work now.

660
00:47:34.911 --> 00:47:37.453
-But will you be our madam?
-Darling...


661
00:47:38.161 --> 00:47:39.495
I'll think about it.

662
00:47:40.953 --> 00:47:42.703
If you refuse...

663
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:44.911
what will happen to us?

664
00:47:47.578 --> 00:47:49.370
-Please say yes, Gangu.
-Rama...


665
00:47:51.661 --> 00:47:52.786
Come on...

666
00:47:53.536 --> 00:47:54.703
Do it, Gangu.

667
00:47:55.661 --> 00:47:57.161
You are our madam now...

668
00:48:20.536 --> 00:48:22.536
<i>From Ganga, 
I became Gangu,</i>

669
00:48:23.161 --> 00:48:25.120
<i>then from Gangu I became Gangubai.</i>

670
00:48:26.453 --> 00:48:27.370
<i>The madam.</i>

671
00:48:29.161 --> 00:48:30.578
If you want,

672
00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:33.286
you too can become
Madhubai from Madhu, dear.


673
00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:37.870
I'm done here.
I have other things to take care of.


674
00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:39.536
Look, darling,

675
00:48:39.828 --> 00:48:42.286
I didn't have any option but to fight,

676
00:48:42.745 --> 00:48:44.786
but you do.

677
00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:47.120
If you choose this,

678
00:48:47.453 --> 00:48:48.828
you live here.

679
00:48:50.161 --> 00:48:51.536
And if you choose this,

680
00:48:51.995 --> 00:48:53.245
you die.

681
00:48:54.203 --> 00:48:55.286
It is poison.

682
00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:58.995
You decide now.

683
00:49:21.703 --> 00:49:23.286
Have you explained it to her?

684
00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:25.703
I have.
Now you need to understand.


685
00:49:26.286 --> 00:49:27.911
This girl will go back home.

686
00:49:28.536 --> 00:49:32.203
I didn't call you here
to set my girl free.


687
00:49:32.495 --> 00:49:34.203
She'd rather die than comply.

688
00:49:34.495 --> 00:49:36.661
If she dies, you'll be in trouble.

689
00:49:36.745 --> 00:49:37.995
I don't care.

690
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.370
If she doesn't spread her legs,
she'll beg.


691
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:42.036
But she will stay here.

692
00:49:42.286 --> 00:49:44.411
I have paid Rs. 1,000 for her.

693
00:49:44.953 --> 00:49:47.578
Come and take ten thousand
from me tomorrow.


694
00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:58.953
Let's go, darling.

695
00:50:01.036 --> 00:50:02.828
Showing off your money!

696
00:50:02.911 --> 00:50:05.036
To me? Rashmibai?

697
00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.828
With the elections around the corner,
she thinks she's a minister already!


698
00:50:08.911 --> 00:50:11.286
No matter how pristine your clothes are,

699
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:14.495
you'll always be a prostitute!

700
00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:19.120
Are you behaving like a saint
now that the elections are here?


701
00:50:19.203 --> 00:50:21.995
Wait and watch what happens
when you lose--


702
00:50:54.953 --> 00:50:56.161
Rehman...

703
00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:57.536
Yes, madam.

704
00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:00.453
I've managed to free her
after a lot of difficulty.


705
00:51:00.536 --> 00:51:04.870
Take the bus tonight and ensure
that she reaches her home safely.


706
00:51:06.578 --> 00:51:09.036
And you'll keep wasting
your money freeing these girls?


707
00:51:09.786 --> 00:51:11.161
I hope you know what you're doing.

708
00:51:11.536 --> 00:51:12.453
Politics...

709
00:51:12.745 --> 00:51:13.953
you won't understand.

710
00:51:14.911 --> 00:51:15.786
Take her and go.

711
00:51:34.245 --> 00:51:35.495
So, Rajjo...

712
00:51:35.578 --> 00:51:37.203
did you try the <i>laddus</i> I sent?

713
00:51:37.286 --> 00:51:38.536
What <i>laddus</i>, Gangubai?

714
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:41.286
Those were polished off by the children!

715
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:45.245
-We didn't get any.
-I'll send some more tomorrow.


716
00:51:45.786 --> 00:51:49.036
You can pack some
for Najma to take to school.


717
00:51:49.203 --> 00:51:52.411
What's the point in sending her to school?
She'll have to work in the brothel anyway.


718
00:51:52.495 --> 00:51:53.703
What nonsense!

719
00:51:53.786 --> 00:51:54.828
Gangubai!

720
00:51:55.203 --> 00:51:57.328
-I've brought saris for you.
-Two minutes.


721
00:51:57.786 --> 00:51:59.995
Listen, this is not right, Rajjo.

722
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.286
-Come and meet me tomorrow.
-Okay, Gangubai.


723
00:52:05.703 --> 00:52:09.203
By the way, the blouse you
tailored last time didn't fit well.


724
00:52:09.328 --> 00:52:12.578
Actually, my eyesight is getting weak.

725
00:52:12.995 --> 00:52:16.328
Along with the saris,
I will take your measurement again today.


726
00:52:19.995 --> 00:52:21.203
Oh, wow...

727
00:52:21.745 --> 00:52:25.536
I had just asked for saris, but
you've brought along "youth" as well.


728
00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:29.370
He is my nephew.

729
00:52:30.161 --> 00:52:32.620
He has come from Calcutta
to learn the business.


730
00:52:32.911 --> 00:52:34.661
He'll take care of
my work from now on.

731
00:52:35.495 --> 00:52:36.786
What's your name again?

732
00:52:37.328 --> 00:52:38.411
Afshan.

733
00:52:38.703 --> 00:52:39.578
That's all?

734
00:52:39.953 --> 00:52:41.453
No... Badr Razaq.

735
00:52:41.536 --> 00:52:42.828
Afshan Badr Razaq.

736
00:52:44.745 --> 00:52:47.286
-Who will take the measurements?
-Go, take the measurements.


737
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:48.620
I'll write them down.

738
00:52:55.578 --> 00:52:57.370
Shoulders, 15 inches.

739
00:53:00.036 --> 00:53:01.120
Sleeves, 6 inches.

740
00:53:05.911 --> 00:53:06.953
Neck, 7 inches.

741
00:53:09.286 --> 00:53:10.578
Neck, 8 inches.

742
00:53:15.578 --> 00:53:18.370
Why are you standing so far?
Are you measuring a tree?


743
00:53:21.328 --> 00:53:23.161
34... chest.

744
00:53:24.411 --> 00:53:25.703
134!

745
00:53:28.078 --> 00:53:29.203
Your heartbeat.

746
00:53:31.495 --> 00:53:32.745
Show me the saris.

747
00:53:41.078 --> 00:53:43.245
Tell me.
Which one should I buy?


748
00:53:43.786 --> 00:53:45.953
Choose any, they're all white.

749
00:53:46.161 --> 00:53:47.745
Which white should I choose?

750
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:49.911
As white as the moon?

751
00:53:50.245 --> 00:53:52.995
Or as white as the clouds?

752
00:53:57.036 --> 00:53:58.953
As white as paper?

753
00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:01.245
Or as white as a white rose?

754
00:54:04.328 --> 00:54:07.453
As white as snow,
or as white as salt?


755
00:54:08.536 --> 00:54:10.411
As white as milk,

756
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:12.828
or as white as seashells?

757
00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.036
As white as the streams,

758
00:54:17.078 --> 00:54:18.703
or as white as sand?

759
00:54:20.786 --> 00:54:21.870
Or as white as smoke?

760
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:26.620
As white as a swan.

761
00:56:07.328 --> 00:56:13.036
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

762
00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:19.203
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

763
00:56:19.286 --> 00:56:24.786
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

764
00:56:25.661 --> 00:56:31.411
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

765
00:56:32.245 --> 00:56:37.286
<i>I embrace and rejoice</i>

766
00:56:37.953 --> 00:56:43.995
<i>In every slur cast upon me</i>

767
00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:49.453
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

768
00:56:50.286 --> 00:56:55.953
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

769
00:56:56.411 --> 00:57:01.911
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

770
00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:08.578
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

771
00:57:27.745 --> 00:57:33.745
<i>Every corner of my house</i>

772
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:39.286
<i>Has become my confidante</i>

773
00:57:39.995 --> 00:57:46.161
<i>They ask myriad of questions</i>

774
00:57:46.245 --> 00:57:51.745
<i>How many do I answer?</i>

775
00:57:52.036 --> 00:57:58.411
<i>Countless emotions in my heart</i>

776
00:57:58.495 --> 00:58:03.370
<i>Came alive</i>

777
00:58:04.078 --> 00:58:09.620
<i>When my lover visited me at sunset</i>

778
00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:16.161
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

779
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:21.911
<i>When my lover visited me at sunset</i>

780
00:58:22.453 --> 00:58:28.161
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

781
00:58:53.870 --> 00:59:00.161
<i>I don't get the
time to look at myself</i>

782
00:59:03.078 --> 00:59:06.828
<i>Everything pales</i>

783
00:59:06.911 --> 00:59:11.578
<i>In the light of his love</i>

784
00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:18.036
<i>I don't get the
time to look at myself</i>

785
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:24.495
<i>Everything pales in the light of his love</i>

786
00:59:24.578 --> 00:59:29.578
<i>I beam with pride</i>

787
00:59:30.245 --> 00:59:35.828
<i>Despite the insults cast upon me</i>

788
00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:42.120
<i>When my lover visits me at sunset</i>

789
00:59:42.828 --> 00:59:48.411
<i>I shine as bright as the moon</i>

790
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:54.328
<i>I embrace and rejoice</i>

791
00:59:54.911 --> 01:00:00.786
<i>In every slur cast upon me</i>

792
01:00:18.036 --> 01:00:20.203
All finances go haywire
with these late bribes.


793
01:00:20.661 --> 01:00:22.578
Ma'am, I need to talk to you.
Is this a good time?


794
01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:23.703
Go on.

795
01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:27.411
I dropped that girl, Madhu, back home.
Her family gave a lot of blessings.


796
01:00:28.036 --> 01:00:31.203
I didn't understand at first,
but what you did was very noble.


797
01:00:31.286 --> 01:00:32.203
Anything else?

798
01:00:32.286 --> 01:00:35.953
Madam, these are last week's collections
from Lane 7 to Lane 11.


799
01:00:36.078 --> 01:00:37.161
Rs. 11,000.

800
01:00:37.245 --> 01:00:38.495
Why such a small sum?

801
01:00:38.995 --> 01:00:41.745
Everyone gets religious
this time of the year.


802
01:00:41.828 --> 01:00:42.911
Badri...

803
01:00:43.203 --> 01:00:46.411
The election for the President
of Kamathipura is coming up.


804
01:00:46.661 --> 01:00:49.078
If we don't have
money, how do we win?

805
01:00:49.161 --> 01:00:51.120
That too against Razia?

806
01:00:51.203 --> 01:00:55.370
Madam, Razia has been the President
of Kamathipura for the last two years.


807
01:00:55.453 --> 01:00:56.870
You can't defeat her.

808
01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:59.370
-She has a strong hold over this place.
-So?


809
01:01:01.828 --> 01:01:02.953
I'll tell you what.

810
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:05.620
Spread the news

811
01:01:06.203 --> 01:01:09.411
that Gangubai has rescued
a 15-year-old innocent girl


812
01:01:09.495 --> 01:01:11.411
and sent her back home.

813
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:15.453
It's time to bring Razia down.

814
01:01:16.411 --> 01:01:17.411
Now leave.

815
01:01:17.495 --> 01:01:19.036
I've kept the money, madam.

816
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:23.578
-Hey, Birju!
-Yes, madam?


817
01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:24.703
Count the money.

818
01:01:24.953 --> 01:01:26.661
It should be 11,000.

819
01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:32.620
Victory to Raziabai!

820
01:01:32.953 --> 01:01:37.161
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


821
01:01:37.245 --> 01:01:41.411
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


822
01:01:41.536 --> 01:01:45.786
-Who is the queen of Kamathipura?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


823
01:01:45.995 --> 01:01:50.161
-Who is the queen of Kamathipura?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


824
01:01:50.245 --> 01:01:54.370
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


825
01:01:54.453 --> 01:01:58.911
Victory to Raziabai!

826
01:01:58.995 --> 01:02:03.245
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


827
01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:07.870
-Who is the queen of Kamathipura?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


828
01:02:07.995 --> 01:02:12.161
Victory to Raziabai!

829
01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:16.745
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


830
01:02:29.578 --> 01:02:33.036
May God bless you with good health
and good fortune.


831
01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.036
Lala,

832
01:02:38.661 --> 01:02:43.411
your grand <i>Eid</i> celebration here
reminds me of Kabul.


833
01:02:43.661 --> 01:02:44.953
It's God's grace.

834
01:02:45.036 --> 01:02:46.703
Sir, Gangubai.

835
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:53.078
Happy <i>Eid</i>, Gangu.

836
01:02:53.161 --> 01:02:54.495
Happy <i>Eid</i>, sir.

837
01:02:54.786 --> 01:02:56.536
Why are you sitting alone here?

838
01:02:56.703 --> 01:03:00.745
Well, I feel smaller
when I'm around these respectable people.


839
01:03:01.536 --> 01:03:03.703
I have made <i>sevaiya</i> for you.

840
01:03:03.786 --> 01:03:05.828
-You made this?
-Yes, for the first time.


841
01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:08.786
Then I have to eat it. Sit.

842
01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:13.786
-Sit down.
-Yes.


843
01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:16.536
You look worried.

844
01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:20.328
Well, the neighborhood elections
are around the corner.


845
01:03:20.703 --> 01:03:23.536
If I win, I'll become
the new President of Kamathipura.


846
01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.203
But Razia is my opponent.

847
01:03:26.078 --> 01:03:28.620
You're no less than Razia Sultan!
Have faith.


848
01:03:29.953 --> 01:03:30.828
You'll win.

849
01:03:31.245 --> 01:03:33.661
Sure, but faith doesn't
help win elections,


850
01:03:33.745 --> 01:03:35.036
money does.

851
01:03:36.328 --> 01:03:37.203
How much?

852
01:03:39.661 --> 01:03:41.161
Think of it as a loan.

853
01:03:43.245 --> 01:03:44.495
May I ask for something else?

854
01:03:45.286 --> 01:03:46.161
Yes.

855
01:03:46.786 --> 01:03:50.495
What if I handle your alcohol business
in Kamathipura?


856
01:03:53.745 --> 01:03:56.911
Sir, customers consume alcohol
and come to Kamathipura.


857
01:03:57.036 --> 01:03:59.620
What if they got the alcohol
at the brothel itself?


858
01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:02.036
"Buy alcohol if you want a woman!"

859
01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.120
We can earn some
extra money as well.


860
01:04:06.078 --> 01:04:08.328
And make my sister sell alcohol?

861
01:04:09.703 --> 01:04:12.870
This <i>Pathan</i> has given up his land,
not his values!


862
01:04:14.411 --> 01:04:17.161
Next time, add some more almonds
to the <i>sevaiya</i>.


863
01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.370
Sir, I know this is wrong,

864
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:24.203
but my intentions are good.

865
01:04:26.036 --> 01:04:29.620
It's not about values,
it's about the lives of those women.


866
01:04:29.703 --> 01:04:32.620
And I have to
win this election for them.

867
01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:37.786
If I win, I can fight for them and try
to change their lives for the better.


868
01:04:39.036 --> 01:04:41.953
Or else, Razia will continue
to make our lives hell.


869
01:04:43.328 --> 01:04:44.745
The rest is up to you.

870
01:04:52.245 --> 01:04:55.161
I surrender my principles
before your good intentions.


871
01:04:56.078 --> 01:04:58.286
From today, we're business partners.

872
01:04:59.036 --> 01:05:03.078
Twenty percent of the profits
from the sales in Kamathipura is yours.


873
01:05:05.286 --> 01:05:07.370
You've done a favor not only to Gangu,

874
01:05:08.453 --> 01:05:10.745
but to the 4,000 women of Kamathipura.

875
01:05:14.203 --> 01:05:16.161
Bow down only before God.

876
01:05:29.828 --> 01:05:30.870
Gangu.

877
01:05:35.786 --> 01:05:37.328
New business calls for a new car.

878
01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:38.745
But, sir--

879
01:05:38.828 --> 01:05:39.995
Your gift for <i>Eid</i>.

880
01:05:41.495 --> 01:05:43.786
Also, get your business cards printed.

881
01:05:44.786 --> 01:05:47.245
"Gangubai, Mafia Queen."

882
01:06:02.536 --> 01:06:03.495
Gangubai?

883
01:06:03.578 --> 01:06:04.786
Who is it?

884
01:06:05.370 --> 01:06:07.495
-It's me...
-Who?


885
01:06:07.828 --> 01:06:10.078
-Afshan!
-Mr. Razaq.


886
01:06:10.453 --> 01:06:11.370
Yes.

887
01:06:11.495 --> 01:06:12.453
Come inside.

888
01:06:13.745 --> 01:06:14.578
Inside?

889
01:06:14.703 --> 01:06:15.786
Yeah.

890
01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:22.370
What brings you here?

891
01:06:22.495 --> 01:06:24.370
I've...

892
01:06:24.953 --> 01:06:26.995
got your blouse, it's ready.

893
01:06:28.078 --> 01:06:29.203
Give it.

894
01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:32.245
You said two days,
you've brought it after a week.


895
01:06:35.911 --> 01:06:40.703
If it doesn't fit me well,
just you wait and watch!


896
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:43.953
Why are you standing? Sit.

897
01:06:55.661 --> 01:06:56.578
What happened?

898
01:06:56.661 --> 01:06:58.661
I'm bathing and you're getting wet!

899
01:06:58.745 --> 01:07:00.745
No, looking at you...

900
01:07:02.578 --> 01:07:04.453
You are so beautiful...

901
01:07:07.828 --> 01:07:09.995
Did I say something wrong?

902
01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.161
You are smiling?

903
01:07:13.578 --> 01:07:15.786
It's called being coy, Mr. Razaq.

904
01:07:17.328 --> 01:07:19.286
I've seen many men come and go,

905
01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:22.286
this is the first time
I'm meeting a real man.


906
01:07:27.286 --> 01:07:28.536
Want something to eat?

907
01:07:29.536 --> 01:07:30.578
No.

908
01:07:31.411 --> 01:07:32.870
Want something to drink?

909
01:07:34.995 --> 01:07:36.245
Want to bathe with me?

910
01:07:38.703 --> 01:07:40.578
Do you have anything
else to say but "no"?

911
01:07:41.161 --> 01:07:43.120
Gangubai, I love you very much.

912
01:07:49.328 --> 01:07:50.411
I love you too.

913
01:07:53.745 --> 01:07:56.411
I feel like hugging you.

914
01:07:59.203 --> 01:08:00.161
Me too.

915
01:09:12.578 --> 01:09:14.745
This new car, Gangu--

916
01:09:15.661 --> 01:09:16.911
Gangubai...

917
01:09:17.078 --> 01:09:18.661
This one is much better,

918
01:09:18.786 --> 01:09:20.286
and more expensive.

919
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.620
I never thought
I'd be sitting in such a car.


920
01:09:23.703 --> 01:09:24.786
But I did.

921
01:09:27.745 --> 01:09:29.870
I don't want you to drink.

922
01:09:30.411 --> 01:09:31.745
Really?

923
01:09:32.245 --> 01:09:33.703
What do you want then?

924
01:09:34.286 --> 01:09:35.870
I want to marry you.

925
01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:42.828
Really, I do.

926
01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.161
This big car has fueled
some big dreams, huh?


927
01:09:49.828 --> 01:09:52.036
-You got upset, my love?
-No, it's okay.


928
01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.870
Fine, I'm not drinking. Happy?

929
01:09:55.745 --> 01:09:57.370
Mr. Razaq...

930
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:23.911
<i>My love... my love...</i>

931
01:10:24.078 --> 01:10:25.911
<i>My love...</i>

932
01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:28.745
<i>My love... my love...</i>

933
01:10:28.828 --> 01:10:30.453
<i>My love...</i>

934
01:10:31.411 --> 01:10:33.786
<i>The night is intoxicating</i>

935
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:35.953
<i>Everything seems heady</i>

936
01:10:36.078 --> 01:10:39.995
<i>Come, let us get drunk</i>

937
01:10:40.661 --> 01:10:42.870
<i>Together we are magic</i>

938
01:10:42.953 --> 01:10:45.161
<i>Under these drunken showers</i>

939
01:10:45.286 --> 01:10:49.536
<i>Come, let us get drunk</i>

940
01:10:49.661 --> 01:10:51.828
<i>My love... my love...</i>

941
01:10:51.911 --> 01:10:53.953
<i>My love...</i>

942
01:10:54.078 --> 01:10:56.453
<i>My love... my love...</i>

943
01:10:56.536 --> 01:10:58.453
<i>My love...</i>

944
01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:33.370
<i>Nothing is as intoxicating as my eyes</i>

945
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:40.411
<i>Nothing is as intoxicating as my eyes</i>

946
01:11:40.703 --> 01:11:44.911
<i>Everyone wishes to drown in them</i>

947
01:11:44.995 --> 01:11:51.536
<i>It is for you
that I reject everyone else</i>

948
01:12:01.161 --> 01:12:03.328
<i>My love... my love...</i>

949
01:12:03.453 --> 01:12:05.286
<i>My love...</i>

950
01:12:05.578 --> 01:12:07.870
<i>My love... my love...</i>

951
01:12:07.953 --> 01:12:10.078
<i>My love...</i>

952
01:12:34.411 --> 01:12:37.786
<i>Stay awake!</i>

953
01:12:41.453 --> 01:12:42.870
You should go home now.

954
01:12:43.661 --> 01:12:45.870
Your intentions don't seem right.

955
01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:51.286
-I was just... your shoes.
-Hmm, good job!


956
01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:54.620
Go on, drop him home.

957
01:12:56.161 --> 01:12:57.661
Birju...

958
01:12:58.036 --> 01:12:59.870
Open the door!

959
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:01.828
Gangubai!

960
01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:03.495
I told you to go home...

961
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:07.161
Raziabai has called for you. Come to
the office at 6 o'clock tomorrow.


962
01:13:07.245 --> 01:13:09.536
Tell Razia that I don't have time!

963
01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:11.661
Hey, you have to come.

964
01:13:11.745 --> 01:13:14.036
Raziabai won't take no for an answer.

965
01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:15.995
What the...

966
01:13:17.661 --> 01:13:19.495
Just hearing Razia's name

967
01:13:20.453 --> 01:13:21.828
makes me want to puke.

968
01:13:21.911 --> 01:13:23.286
You stay in your limits!

969
01:13:28.161 --> 01:13:29.370
How dare you...

970
01:13:29.578 --> 01:13:32.245
-What are you doing?
-Limits, huh?


971
01:13:32.328 --> 01:13:35.745
-If Raziabai finds out--
-You dare talk about limits! Get lost!


972
01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:40.495
How dare you threaten Gangubai
in her house!


973
01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:44.703
Get lost, you piece of shit.
Bloody scumbag!


974
01:13:44.995 --> 01:13:47.661
Telling Gangubai to stay in limits!

975
01:13:48.286 --> 01:13:49.995
Tell Razia...

976
01:13:50.161 --> 01:13:52.203
Gangubai is fearless!

977
01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:54.786
Talking about bloody limits...

978
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:56.620
Threatening Gangubai?

979
01:13:56.953 --> 01:13:59.495
Who are you threatening
about the elections?


980
01:14:01.995 --> 01:14:06.161
Tell Razia...
Gangubai is not scared.


981
01:14:08.786 --> 01:14:10.453
Go. Tell her.

982
01:14:14.578 --> 01:14:15.745
Press harder.

983
01:14:16.203 --> 01:14:18.578
Things still seem upside down.

984
01:14:18.703 --> 01:14:21.036
Are you still hungover, Gangu?

985
01:14:21.453 --> 01:14:22.911
-No.
-Try some steam.


986
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:26.745
<i>My love... my love...</i>

987
01:14:27.203 --> 01:14:29.661
Don't drink so much,
it's not good for health.


988
01:14:29.745 --> 01:14:31.036
Police! Police! Police!

989
01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.995
-The police are here for a raid.
-Come on!


990
01:14:34.995 --> 01:14:37.495
-Birju, you continue...
-Yes, madam.


991
01:14:37.578 --> 01:14:40.536
-Check over there!
-Sir...


992
01:14:43.828 --> 01:14:45.161
Why are you hitting me?

993
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.870
Search every corner!

994
01:14:48.995 --> 01:14:51.120
I'll shut this place down today.

995
01:14:51.245 --> 01:14:52.703
-Shinde.
-Yes, sir.


996
01:14:52.786 --> 01:14:56.453
The madam is making a lot of money
by selling alcohol.


997
01:14:56.661 --> 01:14:58.870
She bought an imported car as well.

998
01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.578
It's Prohibition time.

999
01:15:00.661 --> 01:15:03.203
There's a risk of the madam
going behind bars.


1000
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:05.078
And listen carefully.

1001
01:15:05.453 --> 01:15:09.786
Gangubai, if I find a single bottle,
you will be in jail for five years.


1002
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:11.661
That too, in Nasik jail.

1003
01:15:11.745 --> 01:15:15.453
Heard you're quite found of <i>Pathans</i>.
You'll find a lot of them there.


1004
01:15:15.995 --> 01:15:17.620
-Birju.
-Yes, madam.


1005
01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.120
Do you think Gangubai eats shit?

1006
01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.328
Hmm?

1007
01:15:24.411 --> 01:15:27.911
With elections around the corner
and these hungry dogs running around,


1008
01:15:27.995 --> 01:15:31.161
will Gangu make the mistake
of leaving food out in the open?


1009
01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:43.328
Now shove this in your mouth.

1010
01:15:43.411 --> 01:15:45.620
Maybe it will clean the filth in there.

1011
01:15:48.661 --> 01:15:49.620
Let's go!

1012
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:50.786
The raid's over.

1013
01:15:52.036 --> 01:15:54.370
-Come on, let's leave!
-Let's go.


1014
01:15:55.036 --> 01:15:56.745
Leave!

1015
01:16:01.745 --> 01:16:02.578
What is it?

1016
01:16:02.661 --> 01:16:05.745
Gangubai, Raziabai orchestrated all this.

1017
01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:07.745
Why don't you go meet her once?

1018
01:16:07.828 --> 01:16:09.911
All your problems will come to an end.

1019
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:12.536
Tell Razia I'm very busy.

1020
01:16:12.786 --> 01:16:14.703
I'll meet her on election day.

1021
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.745
-Another thing, Shinde.
-Yes?


1022
01:16:16.828 --> 01:16:18.370
You were a cop.

1023
01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:20.453
When did you become a postman?

1024
01:16:21.828 --> 01:16:23.203
Birju!

1025
01:16:33.036 --> 01:16:34.036
What do you have?

1026
01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.911
-<i>Bheja fry.</i>
-Good choice! This is perfect for her.


1027
01:16:37.328 --> 01:16:39.286
-Madam!
-Hmm?


1028
01:16:39.703 --> 01:16:42.078
Look, Raziabai is here.

1029
01:16:42.328 --> 01:16:45.495
Victory to Raziabai!
Victory to Raziabai!


1030
01:16:45.578 --> 01:16:49.703
-Who is the queen of Kamathipura?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


1031
01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:58.036
You have the time to savor
<i>nalli nihari</i>,


1032
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.953
but not to meet Razia?

1033
01:17:03.703 --> 01:17:07.203
My girls informed me
that the cops visited you.


1034
01:17:08.786 --> 01:17:11.703
They threatened to put you
in jail for five years.


1035
01:17:14.078 --> 01:17:16.328
Thought I'd come here
and meet you one last time


1036
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:21.703
and try to talk some sense into you.

1037
01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:24.620
Birju!

1038
01:17:26.161 --> 01:17:28.036
Get a plate for Raziabai.

1039
01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:34.745
Why would I need a plate,

1040
01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:49.578
when snatching my share
is so much more fun!


1041
01:17:53.536 --> 01:17:55.536
You like to have fun, right?

1042
01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:02.245
Tomorrow I will not only
barge into your house,


1043
01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:04.495
but bury you right there!

1044
01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:07.995
You see these hands?

1045
01:18:08.536 --> 01:18:11.786
When I clap with these hands,

1046
01:18:12.286 --> 01:18:16.286
I can crush my enemy's skull between them.

1047
01:18:17.203 --> 01:18:19.370
Beneath every stone in my area,

1048
01:18:20.578 --> 01:18:25.995
I've buried many like you
who tried to cross me.


1049
01:18:29.078 --> 01:18:30.870
And you're showing me this attitude?

1050
01:18:31.286 --> 01:18:33.620
Why would I show you
any attitude, Raziabai?


1051
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:37.870
I will show you stars in daylight.

1052
01:18:54.828 --> 01:18:59.036
It'll take me only so much time
to show you your worth,


1053
01:18:59.411 --> 01:19:02.078
and it will be that much more fun!

1054
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.745
Forget about this election.

1055
01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:10.036
Kamathipura belonged to Raziabai.

1056
01:19:11.036 --> 01:19:15.161
Kamathipura will
always belong to Raziabai!


1057
01:19:19.036 --> 01:19:21.411
Make sure you come tomorrow at nine,

1058
01:19:22.536 --> 01:19:25.036
for my speech in the neighborhood.

1059
01:19:37.036 --> 01:19:39.370
Victory to Raziabai!

1060
01:19:39.661 --> 01:19:42.036
Victory to Raziabai!

1061
01:19:42.161 --> 01:19:47.370
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


1062
01:19:47.453 --> 01:19:52.870
-Who is our dear sister?
-Raziabai! Raziabai!


1063
01:19:53.953 --> 01:19:58.411
-How do you do this?
-That hawker was so irritating.


1064
01:19:58.703 --> 01:20:01.536
He just refused to reduce the price.

1065
01:20:01.953 --> 01:20:03.411
Yeah, he was...

1066
01:20:05.828 --> 01:20:08.578
Why are you looking
at this idiot's face? Let's go.


1067
01:20:10.953 --> 01:20:14.536
Yesterday, Razia came here
and publicly humiliated me.


1068
01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.536
I will not let her win, Mr. Rahim.

1069
01:20:17.786 --> 01:20:22.286
I will earn respect not just for myself,
but for all the women in Kamathipura.


1070
01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:24.078
-Gangubai--
-Hush.


1071
01:20:24.245 --> 01:20:26.870
By the way, Khan
was here for a raid...

1072
01:20:27.453 --> 01:20:29.453
The loser fled, tail between his legs.

1073
01:20:30.203 --> 01:20:32.078
He didn't find a drop of alcohol.

1074
01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.370
I took care of everything, Mr. Rahim.

1075
01:20:35.745 --> 01:20:38.203
I'm your sister, you've taught me well.

1076
01:20:39.161 --> 01:20:43.245
Razia's cronies have been
threatening me since morning.


1077
01:20:43.578 --> 01:20:46.245
She left in a fit,
who knows what she'll do next.


1078
01:20:46.786 --> 01:20:48.661
You'll have to handle this.

1079
01:20:49.453 --> 01:20:51.536
Send some of your men over,
for our safety.


1080
01:20:52.078 --> 01:20:55.370
If you continue to support us like this,

1081
01:20:55.495 --> 01:20:56.786
this election is ours.

1082
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:58.370
Yes, bye.

1083
01:20:58.453 --> 01:21:00.078
Thank you.

1084
01:21:03.536 --> 01:21:05.203
I have to admit, Mr. Govind,

1085
01:21:06.036 --> 01:21:09.411
by getting these reels,
you've paved the way for our victory.


1086
01:21:09.911 --> 01:21:11.203
-Look, Badri...
-Yes.


1087
01:21:11.286 --> 01:21:13.911
He's got us these reels
directly from the theater.


1088
01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:17.911
Actually, madam, there's one reel missing.

1089
01:21:18.245 --> 01:21:19.620
Don't worry.

1090
01:21:20.411 --> 01:21:23.620
Only two reels are enough
for me to finish Razia!


1091
01:21:25.078 --> 01:21:27.870
Hey, Badri. Set up the screen.

1092
01:21:29.161 --> 01:21:30.370
<i>Have a seat.</i>

1093
01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.036
<i>I'll make this quick.</i>

1094
01:21:33.453 --> 01:21:35.995
<i>So you need not get up either.</i>

1095
01:21:36.245 --> 01:21:39.870
<i>Where's the villain</i>
<i>whom you call your manager?</i>


1096
01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:41.245
<i>Where is he!</i>

1097
01:21:46.245 --> 01:21:48.953
Gangu, your brilliant move
will crush Raziabai.


1098
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:50.995
All of Kamathipura is here.

1099
01:21:51.328 --> 01:21:53.536
Who will go to hear her speech now?

1100
01:21:56.286 --> 01:21:57.453
Where is everyone?

1101
01:21:57.536 --> 01:21:59.370
Watching a movie in Gangu's lane.

1102
01:22:05.995 --> 01:22:08.620
Will I deliver my speech
to these empty chairs?


1103
01:22:11.953 --> 01:22:13.203
Call everyone.

1104
01:22:14.953 --> 01:22:16.245
Get lost!

1105
01:22:44.286 --> 01:22:45.870
What happened, Raziabai?

1106
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:48.745
Weren't you supposed
to deliver a speech?


1107
01:22:51.203 --> 01:22:52.578
No one turned up!

1108
01:22:52.995 --> 01:22:54.161
No problem.

1109
01:22:54.245 --> 01:22:55.203
I am here.

1110
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:56.870
I'll listen to it,

1111
01:22:56.953 --> 01:22:58.661
and clap as well!

1112
01:22:58.745 --> 01:23:02.120
VOTE FOR RAZIABAI

1113
01:23:05.286 --> 01:23:09.495
No one can clap
as thunderously as I do.

1114
01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.995
I am neither a man nor woman,

1115
01:23:13.828 --> 01:23:16.536
but more than enough
for the likes of you!


1116
01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:33.745
Sitting on the ground suits you.

1117
01:23:35.703 --> 01:23:37.245
Get used to it,

1118
01:23:38.245 --> 01:23:40.078
because you will be dethroned soon.

1119
01:23:40.161 --> 01:23:42.078
Defeating Razia

1120
01:23:42.411 --> 01:23:44.453
and hosting a wedding in a brothel,

1121
01:23:45.661 --> 01:23:47.328
are dreams...

1122
01:23:48.578 --> 01:23:49.953
impossible to fulfill!

1123
01:23:52.286 --> 01:23:54.536
Now that you've started a war,

1124
01:23:56.245 --> 01:23:57.745
then prepare yourself...

1125
01:23:59.703 --> 01:24:00.953
for an attack!

1126
01:24:11.245 --> 01:24:12.453
Gangu!

1127
01:24:14.411 --> 01:24:17.661
What's with all this exercise?
You want to be a wrestler?


1128
01:24:18.745 --> 01:24:21.495
How do you like your new poster?

1129
01:24:22.203 --> 01:24:23.536
I'm not shining through.

1130
01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.036
What more do you want?

1131
01:24:25.203 --> 01:24:26.620
You're laden with gold.

1132
01:24:26.911 --> 01:24:28.495
You want a golden tooth as well?

1133
01:24:28.911 --> 01:24:30.120
Good idea.

1134
01:24:31.328 --> 01:24:32.578
If I win, I'll get one.

1135
01:24:33.078 --> 01:24:34.078
Join me.

1136
01:24:38.703 --> 01:24:41.286
Gangu, don't worry.

1137
01:24:41.578 --> 01:24:43.661
The entire neighborhood supports you.

1138
01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:47.578
-That's half the battle won.
-But the other half is still left, Kamli.


1139
01:24:51.203 --> 01:24:53.453
Just one more trump card,

1140
01:24:54.286 --> 01:24:56.370
and that'll be the end of Razia.

1141
01:24:58.411 --> 01:25:03.370
I can't wait to go
and slap your poster on Razia's face!


1142
01:25:04.203 --> 01:25:05.995
All hell will break lose, Gangu.

1143
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:12.786
What happened?

1144
01:25:30.661 --> 01:25:31.745
Kamli.

1145
01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:34.536
Go and get the keys from Kusum.

1146
01:25:37.953 --> 01:25:39.495
I've told you repeatedly

1147
01:25:39.578 --> 01:25:42.578
not to give her opium
and hide her around.


1148
01:25:42.661 --> 01:25:43.953
What else can I do?

1149
01:25:44.953 --> 01:25:46.578
Roshni is 15 now.

1150
01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:49.786
All kinds of men come here every night.

1151
01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:51.995
If one of them spots her,

1152
01:25:52.328 --> 01:25:54.703
she'll be devoured, just like us.

1153
01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:00.203
She might get addicted
and her life will be ruined.


1154
01:26:00.286 --> 01:26:02.036
What life?

1155
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:05.786
We have no home, no roof, no husband...

1156
01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:10.495
Every night we sell our bodies so that
our children may lead a better life.


1157
01:26:12.828 --> 01:26:14.745
I'm tired of hiding her.

1158
01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.328
How long can one
keep a bird caged up?

1159
01:26:19.745 --> 01:26:22.328
You can't cage her
like an animal, Kusum.


1160
01:26:23.245 --> 01:26:24.911
She's old enough to marry.

1161
01:26:25.536 --> 01:26:27.828
I'll either get her married or kill her.

1162
01:26:28.453 --> 01:26:29.995
I won't let her be a prostitute.

1163
01:26:30.078 --> 01:26:32.620
So you'll have a wedding in Kamathipura?

1164
01:26:33.661 --> 01:26:35.453
No one gets married here, Kusum.

1165
01:26:35.578 --> 01:26:37.995
-Stop dreaming of settling her down.
-Why?


1166
01:26:39.786 --> 01:26:43.078
If Gangu can dream,
then why can't Roshni?


1167
01:26:56.953 --> 01:26:58.078
Get off.

1168
01:27:09.953 --> 01:27:11.745
You have a nice house.

1169
01:27:12.536 --> 01:27:15.620
Why don't you get a daughter-in-law
and make it a home?


1170
01:27:15.786 --> 01:27:17.078
Not yet.

1171
01:27:17.286 --> 01:27:19.786
We can barely make ends meet.

1172
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:22.286
And Afshan has just started working--

1173
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:23.495
Exactly.

1174
01:27:24.203 --> 01:27:29.120
Ms. Salma, I've found him a match
that you won't be able to refuse.


1175
01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:32.203
This is Kusum.

1176
01:27:32.495 --> 01:27:36.161
I've brought her daughter, Roshni's
proposal for your son, Afshan.


1177
01:27:39.536 --> 01:27:41.911
A proposal for me?
With whose permission?


1178
01:27:41.995 --> 01:27:44.120
This is ridiculous.

1179
01:27:44.203 --> 01:27:45.536
Kusum!

1180
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:51.286
Around 350 grams of gold,

1181
01:27:51.536 --> 01:27:53.078
fifty thousand rupees in cash...

1182
01:27:53.161 --> 01:27:54.870
and sweets worth Rs. 25.

1183
01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:59.370
If you're still unsure,
have a look at this tray full of gold,


1184
01:27:59.453 --> 01:28:01.786
and the whole world will sparkle
in front of you.


1185
01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:07.328
With all this... are you
trying to buy me or sell her?


1186
01:28:09.245 --> 01:28:10.870
Sir, make him understand...

1187
01:28:11.328 --> 01:28:15.120
I'm not buying or selling, I'm saving her
from ending up as a prostitute.


1188
01:28:15.286 --> 01:28:18.036
And by marrying her,
you'll do a noble deed, my dear.


1189
01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.286
I'm not interested in being noble.
I reject your proposal.


1190
01:28:21.953 --> 01:28:24.078
-Actually--
-We're still talking, Ms. Salma.


1191
01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.536
Brother, please say something.

1192
01:28:31.203 --> 01:28:34.911
Dear, how can a prostitute
be our daughter-in-law?


1193
01:28:34.995 --> 01:28:37.078
That's exactly what I'm trying to say.

1194
01:28:37.786 --> 01:28:41.661
That a prostitute can't be
your daughter-in-law.


1195
01:28:42.995 --> 01:28:45.203
Her mother is a prostitute
but the girl isn't.


1196
01:28:46.703 --> 01:28:49.120
Roshni is just 15...

1197
01:28:49.703 --> 01:28:53.078
innocent, untouched and single.

1198
01:29:02.453 --> 01:29:03.536
Let's go.

1199
01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.578
Hey! Please don't get upset.

1200
01:29:07.078 --> 01:29:09.620
You've brought this gift with love,

1201
01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:12.078
we don't want to insult you
by refusing it.


1202
01:29:12.161 --> 01:29:14.870
There's no pressure,
the decision is yours.


1203
01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.078
We... accept the proposal.

1204
01:29:22.703 --> 01:29:24.370
You're a lucky girl, darling.

1205
01:29:24.995 --> 01:29:27.161
You have a mother,
and now a mother-in-law.


1206
01:29:27.786 --> 01:29:28.953
A husband...

1207
01:29:29.536 --> 01:29:31.620
and truth be told, a rival too!

1208
01:29:59.578 --> 01:30:01.161
Stop sulking.

1209
01:30:02.495 --> 01:30:05.203
You'll be the first groom
in Kamathipura's history--


1210
01:30:05.286 --> 01:30:06.703
Don't you have a heart?

1211
01:30:11.453 --> 01:30:12.745
I mean nothing to you?

1212
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:15.828
Why?

1213
01:30:16.495 --> 01:30:17.745
Why are you doing this?

1214
01:30:18.495 --> 01:30:20.411
If you were in my place,
what would you do?


1215
01:30:21.161 --> 01:30:22.578
I would love you,

1216
01:30:23.078 --> 01:30:24.411
keep you happy...

1217
01:30:24.536 --> 01:30:25.828
I would make a life with you.

1218
01:30:26.161 --> 01:30:30.786
That's what I am doing, making your life.
You can't be my love affair all your life.


1219
01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.578
You're willing to sacrifice me
just to win an election?


1220
01:30:43.661 --> 01:30:45.036
Not for the election.

1221
01:30:46.286 --> 01:30:50.203
For the women of Kamathipura,
Gangu is willing to sacrifice 100 Afshans!


1222
01:30:56.578 --> 01:30:57.786
Is your decision final?

1223
01:30:59.495 --> 01:31:00.745
It's final.

1224
01:31:02.745 --> 01:31:04.120
-Should I get off?
-No.


1225
01:31:04.828 --> 01:31:06.453
Stay for a bit...

1226
01:31:08.786 --> 01:31:09.911
then get off.

1227
01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.245
Looking at your lover's
wedding procession?


1228
01:32:04.953 --> 01:32:06.078
No.

1229
01:32:06.745 --> 01:32:08.870
I'm looking at Razia's funeral procession!

1230
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:11.245
She is done for.

1231
01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.161
And you've become great.

1232
01:32:13.703 --> 01:32:16.161
Who asked you to sacrifice
your happiness for us?


1233
01:32:17.745 --> 01:32:19.286
Doesn't it hurt?

1234
01:32:21.078 --> 01:32:22.328
A lot!

1235
01:32:23.328 --> 01:32:25.620
It hurts like hell, Kamli.

1236
01:32:41.286 --> 01:32:47.203
<i>To spend each evening lost in memories</i>

1237
01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:51.328
<i>A lover needs to have</i>

1238
01:32:51.411 --> 01:32:54.995
<i>A courageous heart</i>

1239
01:32:55.370 --> 01:33:00.953
<i>To die a little every day</i>

1240
01:33:01.036 --> 01:33:05.620
<i>Is what it takes</i>

1241
01:33:05.745 --> 01:33:11.495
<i>To love deeply</i>

1242
01:33:17.995 --> 01:33:23.828
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1243
01:33:23.911 --> 01:33:28.953
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1244
01:33:29.536 --> 01:33:35.203
<i>It can only mean</i>
<i>That his love for me runs deep</i>


1245
01:33:35.286 --> 01:33:40.870
<i>I've heard that he is a heart-breaker</i>

1246
01:33:40.953 --> 01:33:46.411
<i>I've had my heart
broken many a time too</i>

1247
01:33:46.495 --> 01:33:51.703
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1248
01:33:51.786 --> 01:33:54.536
<i>He doesn't look at me lovingly</i>

1249
01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:57.620
<i>Nor does he think about me</i>

1250
01:33:57.703 --> 01:34:00.370
<i>No, he doesn't even think about me</i>

1251
01:34:00.453 --> 01:34:02.953
<i>We cross paths every day</i>

1252
01:34:03.036 --> 01:34:06.078
<i>But he does not even stop me</i>

1253
01:34:06.161 --> 01:34:09.328
<i>No, he doesn't even stop me</i>

1254
01:34:09.411 --> 01:34:12.078
<i>No, he doesn't even stop me</i>

1255
01:34:15.328 --> 01:34:20.911
<i>I've heard that he hates me</i>

1256
01:34:20.995 --> 01:34:26.703
<i>It is in his
hatred that I find solace</i>

1257
01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:32.411
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1258
01:34:32.495 --> 01:34:37.661
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1259
01:34:55.078 --> 01:35:00.786
<i>Go ahead and desert me if you like</i>

1260
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:06.620
<i>But look at me with love at least</i>

1261
01:35:06.703 --> 01:35:12.328
<i>I am disillusioned by promises of loyalty</i>

1262
01:35:12.411 --> 01:35:17.495
<i>Still I permit you to make those mistakes</i>

1263
01:35:17.578 --> 01:35:20.370
<i>His mistakes do not anger me</i>

1264
01:35:20.453 --> 01:35:23.453
<i>There is no distance between us</i>

1265
01:35:23.536 --> 01:35:25.786
<i>There is no distance between us</i>

1266
01:35:26.161 --> 01:35:28.828
-Wow!
-<i>No matter what blame he lays upon me</i>


1267
01:35:28.911 --> 01:35:32.161
<i>I will always remain loyal to him</i>

1268
01:35:32.286 --> 01:35:35.370
<i>Yes, I'll always be loyal</i>

1269
01:35:35.453 --> 01:35:37.911
<i>Yes, I'll always be loyal</i>

1270
01:35:40.953 --> 01:35:46.578
<i>I've heard, he has forgotten me</i>

1271
01:35:46.703 --> 01:35:52.203
<i>But I have a treasure trove of memories</i>

1272
01:35:52.328 --> 01:35:57.495
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1273
01:35:57.578 --> 01:36:00.411
<i>I've heard there are many complaints</i>

1274
01:36:00.495 --> 01:36:02.911
<i>Yes, I've also heard, his love runs deep</i>

1275
01:36:03.036 --> 01:36:05.953
<i>Yes, in his hatred I find solace</i>

1276
01:36:06.078 --> 01:36:08.703
<i>I've had my heart broken many a time</i>

1277
01:36:08.995 --> 01:36:11.620
<i>Complaints, love, solace, 
I have them all</i>

1278
01:36:11.703 --> 01:36:14.661
<i>I have a treasure trove of memories</i>

1279
01:36:14.745 --> 01:36:17.870
<i>I've heard all this...</i>

1280
01:36:17.953 --> 01:36:24.120
<i>I've heard...</i>

1281
01:36:27.745 --> 01:36:31.870
<i>I've heard</i>

1282
01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:36.078
<i>There are many complaints</i>

1283
01:36:44.328 --> 01:36:45.536
Gangu!

1284
01:36:46.328 --> 01:36:47.870
The election results are out.

1285
01:36:48.828 --> 01:36:49.661
And?

1286
01:36:49.745 --> 01:36:51.203
And...

1287
01:36:51.661 --> 01:36:53.286
-You've won!
-You've won!


1288
01:36:53.370 --> 01:36:54.786
You are our President now.

1289
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:57.953
Come, all of Kamathipura
is waiting for you down at the cafe.


1290
01:36:58.036 --> 01:36:59.370
Come on, hurry up.

1291
01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:24.995
Gangubai!

1292
01:37:28.536 --> 01:37:30.536
<i>Nalli nihari</i> for everyone, on me.

1293
01:37:32.411 --> 01:37:35.495
And send two portions to Razia also.

1294
01:37:36.995 --> 01:37:38.995
I had warned Razia,

1295
01:37:39.745 --> 01:37:43.286
I'd defeat her on her home ground,
and I did it!


1296
01:37:45.995 --> 01:37:48.120
Destiny took my childhood home away,

1297
01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:52.911
but it doesn't matter...

1298
01:37:54.703 --> 01:37:57.703
You have made me the President
of Kamathipura today.


1299
01:37:58.495 --> 01:37:59.578
Thank you.

1300
01:37:59.953 --> 01:38:01.911
You've given Gangu so much love.

1301
01:38:05.203 --> 01:38:06.161
Thank you.

1302
01:38:08.245 --> 01:38:11.495
Gangu will return your love
with interest, it's my promise


1303
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:14.620
to everyone... to you, and you...

1304
01:38:16.161 --> 01:38:19.661
Oh, Rashmi!

1305
01:38:21.245 --> 01:38:22.745
Will you be my secretary?

1306
01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:33.370
Gangubai will say three things...

1307
01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:34.995
First,

1308
01:38:36.245 --> 01:38:40.120
people think we're dishonest, no problem.

1309
01:38:41.495 --> 01:38:44.828
But do this dishonest work with honesty.

1310
01:38:44.995 --> 01:38:46.661
Complete honesty!

1311
01:38:48.036 --> 01:38:48.911
Second,

1312
01:38:49.745 --> 01:38:51.870
a flower, by nature, is fragrant...

1313
01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:56.911
whether it's in a temple or a shrine,
at a brothel or a funeral...


1314
01:38:56.995 --> 01:38:58.786
spread your fragrance!

1315
01:38:59.870 --> 01:39:01.995
Satisfy your clients fully...

1316
01:39:02.661 --> 01:39:04.995
but also remember to get paid... fully!

1317
01:39:06.328 --> 01:39:07.870
We want progress.

1318
01:39:12.453 --> 01:39:13.786
Third,

1319
01:39:15.911 --> 01:39:17.536
live with dignity.

1320
01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.286
Never fear anyone.

1321
01:39:21.245 --> 01:39:26.661
Be it the police, be it an MLA
or a minister or a pimp. Fear no one.


1322
01:39:28.453 --> 01:39:33.745
When women are the embodiment
of power, wealth and intelligence,


1323
01:39:34.745 --> 01:39:37.328
what makes these men feel so superior?

1324
01:39:37.411 --> 01:39:39.620
Well said! Bravo! Bravo!

1325
01:39:58.161 --> 01:40:00.203
Don't move.

1326
01:40:03.411 --> 01:40:04.495
Kamli!

1327
01:40:04.953 --> 01:40:06.661
Stop screaming out my name.

1328
01:40:06.745 --> 01:40:08.870
You wanted a golden tooth, right?

1329
01:40:08.995 --> 01:40:10.120
Now bear the pain!

1330
01:40:14.495 --> 01:40:16.495
They are back for a raid!

1331
01:40:17.161 --> 01:40:19.411
Gangu, this time they're raiding Lane 14.

1332
01:40:20.995 --> 01:40:22.370
-What?
-Hold on.


1333
01:40:23.703 --> 01:40:25.411
It's the third one this week.

1334
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:27.745
These cops are acting too smart.

1335
01:40:28.245 --> 01:40:30.411
I'll have to find out what's going on.

1336
01:40:30.578 --> 01:40:32.911
Khan needs to be tightened again.

1337
01:40:37.495 --> 01:40:38.536
Come back, Doctor.

1338
01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.370
Open your mouth.

1339
01:40:41.953 --> 01:40:44.120
Wider. Open wider.

1340
01:40:44.203 --> 01:40:46.828
Are you going to shove
all of China in my mouth?


1341
01:40:51.286 --> 01:40:52.578
One, two, three...

1342
01:40:52.661 --> 01:40:55.953
These cops are conducting too many raids.
Time to bribe them.


1343
01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:00.245
Four, five, six... This is for <i>Navratri</i>.
We'll make it a grand affair!


1344
01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:04.120
Seven, eight, nine, ten.
Put this in the girls' bank accounts.


1345
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:07.495
-What did the bank manager say?
-I tried my best,


1346
01:41:07.578 --> 01:41:10.453
but they refuse to open
bank accounts for our girls.


1347
01:41:10.536 --> 01:41:13.745
But they're okay opening
our girls' clothes?


1348
01:41:14.370 --> 01:41:15.536
Great!

1349
01:41:15.703 --> 01:41:17.703
One, two, three, four, five...

1350
01:41:17.786 --> 01:41:20.495
No... this is for my jewelry.

1351
01:41:20.995 --> 01:41:22.036
Go,

1352
01:41:22.203 --> 01:41:24.828
Arrange a meeting
with the manager tomorrow.


1353
01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.328
-Madam!
-Yes.


1354
01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.286
Yes, Nimmi.

1355
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:31.786
I'm going to my village.

1356
01:41:32.161 --> 01:41:33.828
Give it another thought,

1357
01:41:34.245 --> 01:41:36.495
finish your tuberculosis treatment first.

1358
01:41:36.578 --> 01:41:38.328
I'm afraid I'll die, madam.

1359
01:41:38.911 --> 01:41:42.370
Before that happens,
I want to see my mother once.


1360
01:41:43.953 --> 01:41:46.078
Maybe she has forgiven me now.

1361
01:41:46.453 --> 01:41:47.578
Maybe...

1362
01:41:49.411 --> 01:41:52.203
And if she hasn't, come back to us.

1363
01:41:53.495 --> 01:41:55.536
There are enough people here
to perform your last rites.


1364
01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.245
I'll leave.

1365
01:42:11.786 --> 01:42:14.120
-Yes?
<i>-Booked a two-minute call to Kathiawar?</i>


1366
01:42:14.203 --> 01:42:15.661
-Yes.
<i>-Stay on line.</i>


1367
01:42:15.745 --> 01:42:17.161
-<i>I will connect you.</i>
-Yes.


1368
01:42:18.036 --> 01:42:18.870
<i>Hello?</i>

1369
01:42:21.286 --> 01:42:22.161
<i>Hello?</i>

1370
01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:25.286
<i>No one's saying anything.</i>

1371
01:42:26.161 --> 01:42:27.661
-Mom...
<i>-Who?</i>


1372
01:42:28.703 --> 01:42:30.036
<i>Who is it?</i>

1373
01:42:30.578 --> 01:42:33.703
Gangu... Ganga... it's me, Ganga.

1374
01:42:36.203 --> 01:42:39.953
-Mom, it's me, Ganga.
<i>-I heard you.</i>


1375
01:42:40.036 --> 01:42:42.036
<i>You're calling me after 12 years?</i>

1376
01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.578
Yes... I still remember
our telephone number after 12 years.


1377
01:42:47.078 --> 01:42:48.703
4234.

1378
01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:52.286
-I'll always remember it.
<i>-Anything else?</i>


1379
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:54.620
<i>I have to go to the temple,</i>
<i>I'm getting late.</i>


1380
01:42:54.703 --> 01:42:57.495
Oh, your cupboard keys, I have--

1381
01:42:57.578 --> 01:43:00.161
<i>Is this why you've called</i>
<i>after so many years?</i>


1382
01:43:02.495 --> 01:43:03.536
No...

1383
01:43:05.745 --> 01:43:08.453
I miss you, Mom. A lot.

1384
01:43:08.536 --> 01:43:09.536
<i>It's Ganga...</i>

1385
01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.078
<i>What do I talk about?</i>

1386
01:43:11.161 --> 01:43:12.745
<i>-Why did she call?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>


1387
01:43:12.828 --> 01:43:14.411
<i>-I don't understand...</i>
-Who are you talking to?


1388
01:43:14.495 --> 01:43:16.078
Talk to me.

1389
01:43:16.161 --> 01:43:18.495
<i>What is there to talk about? Huh?</i>

1390
01:43:19.078 --> 01:43:20.245
I know you're angry.

1391
01:43:21.536 --> 01:43:22.411
It's okay.

1392
01:43:24.078 --> 01:43:25.953
Where is dad? Will he talk to me?

1393
01:43:26.036 --> 01:43:27.245
<i>He is no more.</i>

1394
01:43:28.286 --> 01:43:30.370
<i>And yes, you should know...</i>

1395
01:43:31.078 --> 01:43:34.036
<i>he refused to drink Gangajal</i>
<i>at the time of his death,</i>


1396
01:43:34.578 --> 01:43:36.078
<i>as it has your name in it.</i>

1397
01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:37.578
<i>Thirty seconds left.</i>

1398
01:43:37.661 --> 01:43:38.745
One second.

1399
01:43:38.828 --> 01:43:41.328
Mom, dad refused
the <i>Gangajal</i> because of--


1400
01:43:41.411 --> 01:43:45.245
-<i>Thirty seconds left.</i>
-Hey! What is this "30 seconds" nonsense!


1401
01:43:45.661 --> 01:43:47.036
My father is dead.

1402
01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.078
I'm supposed to mourn in 30 seconds?

1403
01:43:49.661 --> 01:43:53.078
My mom is angry, she won't talk to me.
I want her to hear me out.


1404
01:43:53.161 --> 01:43:54.786
I need to tell her
about the last 12 years!


1405
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:56.536
How do I do that in 30 seconds?

1406
01:43:58.078 --> 01:44:02.036
What I've been through over these years...
How much I've craved for her love...


1407
01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:03.870
How do I say all this...

1408
01:44:06.745 --> 01:44:08.286
in 30 seconds?

1409
01:44:34.286 --> 01:44:35.661
Rama!

1410
01:44:36.411 --> 01:44:38.786
Come, my love. 
Make this <i>rangoli</i> with us.

1411
01:44:40.453 --> 01:44:44.245
Gangu, your idea to celebrate
<i>Navratri</i> is great!


1412
01:44:46.536 --> 01:44:48.036
But why do you look sad?

1413
01:44:49.161 --> 01:44:51.578
I really miss my home during <i>Navratri</i>.

1414
01:44:52.578 --> 01:44:53.411
Never mind.

1415
01:44:54.161 --> 01:44:56.828
Tonight we'll celebrate <i>Navratri</i>
in our neighborhood.


1416
01:44:58.078 --> 01:44:59.495
And I've decided,

1417
01:44:59.786 --> 01:45:01.995
no man will lay
a hand on us tonight.

1418
01:45:03.036 --> 01:45:04.036
Just imagine

1419
01:45:04.411 --> 01:45:07.578
how frustrated that would make them.

1420
01:45:10.328 --> 01:45:12.078
I'm three months pregnant.

1421
01:45:13.203 --> 01:45:14.495
I've decided

1422
01:45:15.578 --> 01:45:17.161
to have the child this time.

1423
01:45:18.203 --> 01:45:20.328
At least I'll have
someone to call my own.

1424
01:45:31.495 --> 01:45:34.453
<i>O Goddess of Power, come and bless us</i>

1425
01:45:34.536 --> 01:45:39.661
<i>As we play garba together</i>

1426
01:45:45.661 --> 01:45:47.620
<i>Drummer...</i>

1427
01:45:48.828 --> 01:45:50.453
<i>Drummer...</i>

1428
01:45:52.328 --> 01:45:53.828
<i>My dear friends</i>

1429
01:45:53.911 --> 01:45:55.453
<i>Let us dance and twirl</i>

1430
01:45:55.536 --> 01:45:58.578
<i>As the drummer plays the drum</i>

1431
01:45:58.661 --> 01:46:01.953
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1432
01:46:02.036 --> 01:46:05.161
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1433
01:46:05.245 --> 01:46:08.411
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1434
01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:11.453
<i>As the wind dances on the drums</i>

1435
01:46:11.786 --> 01:46:14.995
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1436
01:46:15.078 --> 01:46:18.120
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1437
01:46:38.078 --> 01:46:41.120
<i>My heart skips a beat</i>

1438
01:46:41.203 --> 01:46:44.578
<i>I dance with abandon</i>

1439
01:46:44.661 --> 01:46:47.703
<i>I seem to have lost my senses</i>

1440
01:46:47.786 --> 01:46:51.161
<i>As I get high on the drum beats</i>

1441
01:46:51.245 --> 01:46:54.036
<i>My heart skips a beat</i>

1442
01:46:54.245 --> 01:46:57.453
<i>I dance with abandon</i>

1443
01:46:57.745 --> 01:47:00.495
<i>I seem to have lost my senses</i>

1444
01:47:00.578 --> 01:47:03.620
<i>As I get high on the drum beats</i>

1445
01:47:04.203 --> 01:47:07.328
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1446
01:47:07.411 --> 01:47:10.453
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1447
01:47:10.578 --> 01:47:13.786
<i>Hey, drummer, play the drums</i>

1448
01:47:13.953 --> 01:47:16.703
<i>As the wind dances on the drums</i>

1449
01:47:16.911 --> 01:47:20.286
<i>Our beloved Goddess</i>

01:47:20.370 --> 01:47:24.411
<i>Goddess Amba of Arasur</i>

1451
01:47:25.328 --> 01:47:28.370
<i>The Goddess of Pawagarh</i>

1452
01:47:28.495 --> 01:47:32.620
<i>Goddess Mahakali</i>
<i>The drums play in Your honor</i>


1453
01:47:36.578 --> 01:47:39.786
<i>O Goddess, Your beauty is exceptional</i>

1454
01:47:40.286 --> 01:47:44.328
<i>Your beauty knows no bounds</i>

1455
01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:48.328
<i>The sun, moon and stars</i>

1456
01:47:48.453 --> 01:47:52.328
<i>Praise Your virtues</i>

1457
01:47:53.036 --> 01:47:56.286
<i>I bow down before You, O Goddess</i>

1458
01:47:56.370 --> 01:48:00.911
<i>You are our savior</i>

1459
01:48:00.995 --> 01:48:04.578
<i>You, who reside on the mountain peak</i>

1460
01:48:04.661 --> 01:48:07.411
<i>The powerful Goddess Chandi</i>

1461
01:48:07.495 --> 01:48:10.703
<i>The powerful Goddess Chandi...</i>

1462
01:48:32.078 --> 01:48:33.536
Assalamu alaikum, sir.

1463
01:48:34.203 --> 01:48:35.495
Alaikum assalam, Gangu.

1464
01:48:36.203 --> 01:48:39.411
-How was the <i>Navratri</i> celebration?
-Fantastic.


1465
01:48:40.286 --> 01:48:42.203
We danced the night away.

1466
01:48:42.786 --> 01:48:45.495
For the first time
in the history of Kamathipura,


1467
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:48.370
I closed our business for an entire night.

1468
01:48:49.495 --> 01:48:50.995
Meet these two gentlemen.

1469
01:48:52.036 --> 01:48:55.120
They have come to close down
your business once and for all.


1470
01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:57.578
What do you mean?

1471
01:48:58.453 --> 01:49:01.245
He is the Secretary
of Ward C, Mr. Shah.

1472
01:49:01.786 --> 01:49:06.786
He has drafted a petition along
with the school behind Lane 14


1473
01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:10.411
to vacate everyone from Kamathipura!

1474
01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:13.536
But why?

1475
01:49:14.036 --> 01:49:16.745
What have we done wrong?

1476
01:49:17.078 --> 01:49:19.578
They say you're bad influence
on the students.


1477
01:49:23.036 --> 01:49:26.328
Being located near a brothel
is bad influence on the school?


1478
01:49:27.245 --> 01:49:31.078
Then why isn't being located near
a school a good influence on the brothel?


1479
01:49:32.703 --> 01:49:36.953
Mr. Rahim, what say do we have
in front of the school board?


1480
01:49:37.203 --> 01:49:39.286
Ward C has also supported them.

1481
01:49:39.661 --> 01:49:41.286
And supported the builder too.

1482
01:49:42.578 --> 01:49:45.411
Using this as an excuse,
you want to vacate their area


1483
01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:48.370
and build skyscrapers there.

1484
01:49:48.453 --> 01:49:50.578
May I say something, sir?

1485
01:49:50.661 --> 01:49:52.578
This petition will benefit everyone.

1486
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:54.286
I'll speak to the builder

1487
01:49:54.661 --> 01:49:58.078
and get one flat
each for you and madam.

1488
01:50:03.161 --> 01:50:08.870
Trying to bribe a free bird
with a measly cage?


1489
01:50:10.078 --> 01:50:11.995
Sir... What the...

1490
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:13.453
This is an insult!

1491
01:50:13.745 --> 01:50:14.578
It is.

1492
01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.495
You're insulted
just because your shirt is torn.


1493
01:50:18.286 --> 01:50:21.745
And tearing down their homes
isn't an insult to them?


1494
01:50:23.203 --> 01:50:25.370
Lala likes to make homes,

1495
01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:27.328
not break them!

1496
01:50:28.495 --> 01:50:30.203
If you dare do this again,

1497
01:50:31.036 --> 01:50:33.078
I'll make sure you go home naked.

1498
01:50:34.078 --> 01:50:34.953
Goodbye.

1499
01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.370
Let's go.

1500
01:50:42.411 --> 01:50:44.078
Listen to me carefully, Gangu.

1501
01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:47.870
The government will send you
a notice in two days.


1502
01:50:48.620 --> 01:50:50.328
I'll handle the builders.

1503
01:50:50.911 --> 01:50:52.953
But the school authorities

1504
01:50:53.578 --> 01:50:55.620
will drag you to court.

1505
01:50:56.703 --> 01:51:00.078
I can tackle these neighborhood battles,
but court--


1506
01:51:00.203 --> 01:51:01.911
Turn your fear into your strength.

1507
01:51:03.245 --> 01:51:05.370
The lives of 4,000 women depend on you.

1508
01:51:05.995 --> 01:51:06.953
If you lose,

1509
01:51:07.328 --> 01:51:10.120
you lose not once, but 4,000 times.

1510
01:51:10.536 --> 01:51:13.745
Gangu, you must win this battle!

1511
01:51:16.828 --> 01:51:20.036
-End prostitution!
-End prostitution!


1512
01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:22.828
-Vacate Kamathipura!
-Vacate Kamathipura


1513
01:51:22.911 --> 01:51:25.911
-End prostitution!
-End prostitution!


1514
01:51:25.995 --> 01:51:28.870
-Vacate Kamathipura!
-Vacate Kamathipura!


1515
01:51:28.953 --> 01:51:31.911
-Shame on Gangubai!
-Shame on Gangubai!


1516
01:51:32.036 --> 01:51:33.828
What? Turn your head, silly girl!

1517
01:51:33.911 --> 01:51:36.036
-You hear this nonsense?
-I hear them.


1518
01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:38.161
They think I'll get scared.

1519
01:51:38.245 --> 01:51:40.745
So fighting the case
for the last five months


1520
01:51:40.828 --> 01:51:42.453
has all gone to waste, Gangu.

1521
01:51:42.786 --> 01:51:44.495
They're in the neighborhood.

1522
01:51:44.661 --> 01:51:46.661
What if they come into our house?

1523
01:51:47.453 --> 01:51:48.620
Attack.

1524
01:51:49.453 --> 01:51:50.495
What?

1525
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:52.578
I mean...

1526
01:51:54.786 --> 01:51:55.661
Attack!

1527
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:59.078
-Vacate Kamathipura!
-Vacate Kamathipura!


1528
01:51:59.161 --> 01:52:02.036
-End prostitution!
-End prostitution!


1529
01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:04.995
-Vacate Kamathipura!
-Vacate Kamathipura!


1530
01:52:05.078 --> 01:52:08.745
Shame on Gangubai!

1531
01:52:08.828 --> 01:52:11.995
Shame on Gangubai!

1532
01:52:12.078 --> 01:52:14.953
Vacate Kamathipura!

1533
01:52:15.036 --> 01:52:21.161
Shame on Gangubai!

1534
01:52:21.245 --> 01:52:23.995
Shame on Gangubai!

1535
01:52:24.411 --> 01:52:26.911
You don't understand, Mr. Fezi,
this is a girls' school.


1536
01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:32.161
If 14-15 year old girls see such
immoral activities going on outside,


1537
01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:33.703
how will it affect them?

1538
01:52:33.786 --> 01:52:36.995
Are you saying that everything
that's wrong with the world


1539
01:52:37.078 --> 01:52:38.786
resides in this neighborhood?

1540
01:52:39.161 --> 01:52:40.078
Yes, exactly.

1541
01:52:40.161 --> 01:52:44.786
That's why we got this petition signed,
to remove those people from here.


1542
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:47.703
Then you should
get the entire city vacated.


1543
01:52:48.495 --> 01:52:52.370
-Immorality resides everywhere.
-Come on, sit here quietly.


1544
01:52:52.453 --> 01:52:53.745
Khushbu, don't make noise.

1545
01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:55.995
Hello, Mr. Principal.

1546
01:52:56.078 --> 01:52:57.370
These are my daughters.

1547
01:52:57.453 --> 01:53:00.870
See how neatly they've dressed up
to meet you.


1548
01:53:00.995 --> 01:53:02.995
Yeah, I see... but who are you?

1549
01:53:03.328 --> 01:53:05.703
And how did you get in without permission?

1550
01:53:05.786 --> 01:53:08.911
Just like how you sent us a notice
without permission!


1551
01:53:08.995 --> 01:53:12.120
Truth be told, that's when
I found out that this school


1552
01:53:12.203 --> 01:53:13.578
has been here for 40 years.

1553
01:53:13.661 --> 01:53:16.370
Now that you know,
leave this neighborhood.


1554
01:53:17.453 --> 01:53:20.995
Sister, your school
has been here for 40 years,


1555
01:53:21.078 --> 01:53:23.536
and we have been
here for a 100 years!

1556
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:27.870
Didn't you think
when you were constructing the school


1557
01:53:27.953 --> 01:53:29.745
that there's a brothel next door?

1558
01:53:31.703 --> 01:53:36.161
Father, all this protesting
is affecting our business.


1559
01:53:36.661 --> 01:53:38.203
Clients are scared to come.

1560
01:53:38.286 --> 01:53:40.161
The children barely have food.

1561
01:53:42.161 --> 01:53:44.286
Stop ringing the bell, Father!

1562
01:53:44.370 --> 01:53:48.078
One call from me and the entire
neighborhood will land up here.


1563
01:53:48.703 --> 01:53:50.245
Don't start a war.

1564
01:53:52.245 --> 01:53:54.578
Why are you writing down all this?
Who are you?


1565
01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:57.578
I'm a reporter...
Hamid Fezi, Urdu Times.


1566
01:53:58.328 --> 01:53:59.911
-Journalist?
-Yes.


1567
01:54:00.953 --> 01:54:03.078
I'm a Prostitute... Gangubai!

1568
01:54:05.828 --> 01:54:08.870
Are you done talking?
You may leave now.


1569
01:54:08.953 --> 01:54:11.620
My dear Sister, I will leave,

1570
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:14.995
but only after my children
get admission in this school.


1571
01:54:15.995 --> 01:54:17.953
I've even got the school fees.

1572
01:54:18.078 --> 01:54:20.578
Here, five years' fees for eight girls.

1573
01:54:20.661 --> 01:54:21.703
Take it back.

1574
01:54:22.370 --> 01:54:24.370
We cannot enroll your girls here.

1575
01:54:25.911 --> 01:54:29.411
So what if they're from a brothel?
They have a right to education.


1576
01:54:30.161 --> 01:54:32.078
And I'll make sure they get it, Father.

1577
01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:39.245
Imagine, if one of them becomes
a doctor, an engineer or a barrister...


1578
01:54:39.370 --> 01:54:41.161
Her life will change.

1579
01:54:41.661 --> 01:54:44.203
Then you won't have any complaints, right?

1580
01:54:44.286 --> 01:54:45.286
Of course.

1581
01:54:45.995 --> 01:54:46.870
Another thing...

1582
01:54:47.453 --> 01:54:50.995
A-aah, E-eeh, O-ooh...

1583
01:54:51.453 --> 01:54:54.120
They learn these sounds in the brothel.

1584
01:54:55.995 --> 01:54:57.911
The rest, you can teach them here.

1585
01:54:59.036 --> 01:55:02.453
Come on, Sister,
take out the admission form.


1586
01:55:02.536 --> 01:55:05.245
Write... Mother's name,
Gangubai Kathiawadi.


1587
01:55:05.495 --> 01:55:06.536
And father?

1588
01:55:07.286 --> 01:55:08.870
What should
we write as the father's name?


1589
01:55:11.411 --> 01:55:13.036
The mother's name is not enough, huh?

1590
01:55:14.911 --> 01:55:17.036
All right, father's name, Dev Anand.

1591
01:55:18.411 --> 01:55:21.703
Everyone's father's name
is Dev Anand. Happy?


1592
01:55:22.286 --> 01:55:23.495
Admission complete?

1593
01:55:24.536 --> 01:55:27.078
Girls, say "thank you" to Father.

1594
01:55:27.161 --> 01:55:29.911
-Thank you, Father.
-Thank you, Father.


1595
01:55:29.995 --> 01:55:31.786
See, Mr. Fezi, what a great day!

1596
01:55:32.328 --> 01:55:34.828
My girls only had a mother until now,

1597
01:55:35.286 --> 01:55:36.745
now they have a Father too!

1598
01:55:38.995 --> 01:55:40.995
Thank you, Father. Thank you.

1599
01:55:43.786 --> 01:55:45.411
Visit us at the brothel sometime.

1600
01:55:46.078 --> 01:55:48.536
You'll find young girls
and good stories too!


1601
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:52.495
Come, children,
it's time to buy your uniforms.


1602
01:55:52.578 --> 01:55:53.786
Don't make noise.

1603
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:55.495
Buy us popsicles too.

1604
01:55:55.578 --> 01:55:57.745
No popsicles! You'll catch a cold.

1605
01:56:00.245 --> 01:56:02.328
<i>I hope he arrives--</i>

1606
01:56:02.661 --> 01:56:03.828
Madam.

1607
01:56:04.411 --> 01:56:06.703
Some Mr. Farzi is here to meet you.

1608
01:56:06.911 --> 01:56:08.286
Who's Mr. Farzi?

1609
01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:12.245
Idiot! It must be Mr. 
Fezi, not Farzi!

1610
01:56:12.328 --> 01:56:13.703
A journalist. Let him in.

1611
01:56:14.078 --> 01:56:15.411
I'll send him in.

1612
01:56:17.286 --> 01:56:21.286
Come in, Mr. Fezi.

1613
01:56:22.245 --> 01:56:24.411
The newspaper has found
its way to a brothel!


1614
01:56:24.495 --> 01:56:27.328
Sorry,
I came without informing you.


1615
01:56:27.828 --> 01:56:29.536
Who makes an appointment to come here?

1616
01:56:30.286 --> 01:56:31.745
-Please sit.
-Thank you.


1617
01:56:33.161 --> 01:56:35.578
Ms. Gangu, I wanted to ask you--

1618
01:56:37.536 --> 01:56:39.245
Why are you laughing?

1619
01:56:39.328 --> 01:56:42.536
It's the first time someone has
addressed me with respect.


1620
01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.328
What brings you here?

1621
01:56:44.411 --> 01:56:47.536
Did your girls
get enrolled in that school?


1622
01:56:47.661 --> 01:56:48.995
Why wouldn't they?

1623
01:56:49.453 --> 01:56:52.370
In fact, today I dropped them
to the class myself.


1624
01:56:52.620 --> 01:56:53.745
They cried a lot...

1625
01:56:53.828 --> 01:56:56.245
but I told them to study well
or they'd be punished!


1626
01:56:56.536 --> 01:56:58.870
May I take your photograph, Ms. Gangu?

1627
01:56:58.953 --> 01:56:59.828
My photograph?

1628
01:57:00.286 --> 01:57:02.370
I'm no movie star.

1629
01:57:02.703 --> 01:57:04.703
But you're the star of Kamathipura.

1630
01:57:06.203 --> 01:57:07.370
Anyway,

1631
01:57:07.703 --> 01:57:11.370
a magazine interview
without a photograph is incomplete.


1632
01:57:11.453 --> 01:57:13.578
Are you interviewing me, Mr. Fezi?

1633
01:57:14.328 --> 01:57:16.286
Our services come with a price.

1634
01:57:17.495 --> 01:57:20.870
And even if you publish my photograph,
who reads magazines here?


1635
01:57:21.328 --> 01:57:22.495
Maybe not here,

1636
01:57:22.786 --> 01:57:24.745
but people across the world will read it.

1637
01:57:24.828 --> 01:57:26.161
The world...

1638
01:57:26.245 --> 01:57:29.120
By the way,
what's your educational qualifications?


1639
01:57:29.245 --> 01:57:30.578
I've studied until ninth grade.

1640
01:57:30.661 --> 01:57:32.370
And where are you from?

1641
01:57:33.203 --> 01:57:34.245
Kathiawar.

1642
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:36.745
Don't you ever feel
like going back home?


1643
01:57:39.286 --> 01:57:41.495
Stop these annoying questions, Mr. Fezi.

1644
01:57:44.745 --> 01:57:45.953
Enough.

1645
01:57:47.745 --> 01:57:49.120
That's enough for today.

1646
01:57:49.703 --> 01:57:51.453
Come back after two days.

1647
01:57:51.828 --> 01:57:54.120
It's time for me to give this medicine...

1648
01:57:54.203 --> 01:57:55.745
My friend, Kamli,

1649
01:57:56.703 --> 01:57:57.911
she's very sick.

1650
01:57:58.370 --> 01:58:00.453
Pray for her speedy recovery.

1651
01:58:01.161 --> 01:58:02.536
Gangubai...

1652
01:58:04.036 --> 01:58:06.620
What happened?
Why are you back so early?


1653
01:58:06.995 --> 01:58:10.828
-School doesn't get over until 4 pm.
-The teacher hit us and threw us out.


1654
01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:16.203
See, this is the respect we get.

1655
01:58:17.411 --> 01:58:18.828
Come here.

1656
01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:24.161
Take the photograph now, Mr. Fezi.

1657
01:58:25.328 --> 01:58:27.995
And make sure this photo is published
in your magazine


1658
01:58:28.911 --> 01:58:30.328
for the world to see!

1659
01:58:55.578 --> 01:58:57.078
The medicine is not working.

1660
01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.036
Now that she's finally a mother,
look at her luck.


1661
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:03.120
She's on her deathbed.

1662
01:59:04.411 --> 01:59:06.286
This child will be the death of her.

1663
01:59:15.286 --> 01:59:16.411
Pammi...

1664
01:59:17.370 --> 01:59:18.911
Nothing will happen to Pammi.

1665
01:59:20.536 --> 01:59:21.870
I’ll look after her.

1666
01:59:24.245 --> 01:59:25.620
Take this medicine.

1667
01:59:26.536 --> 01:59:28.036
I made it myself.

1668
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:31.495
Don't do this, Kamli.

1669
01:59:32.953 --> 01:59:34.620
You're the only friend I have.

1670
01:59:36.953 --> 01:59:37.995
Best friend...

1671
01:59:41.411 --> 01:59:42.661
Best friend.

1672
02:00:34.411 --> 02:00:36.578
-I want to meet Ms. Gangu--
-Not today.


1673
02:00:36.661 --> 02:00:39.453
But she had asked me
to come after two days.


1674
02:00:39.786 --> 02:00:41.203
Kamli passed away.

1675
02:00:42.370 --> 02:00:43.828
The brothel is shut today.

1676
02:00:51.286 --> 02:00:52.745
She has such thick hair.

1677
02:00:55.453 --> 02:00:57.745
Braiding them takes the life out of you.

1678
02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.036
The first time I saw her,

1679
02:01:02.411 --> 02:01:04.453
she was running away from Mr. Mandar

1680
02:01:05.036 --> 02:01:07.036
half naked, her hair in a mess...

1681
02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:09.370
yet so beautiful.

1682
02:01:11.245 --> 02:01:12.370
Forget the man,

1683
02:01:12.786 --> 02:01:15.245
even I was attracted to her!

1684
02:01:16.203 --> 02:01:18.578
She liked everything bling.

1685
02:01:19.578 --> 02:01:25.120
Even in a dark movie hall,
she'd shine brighter than the actress!


1686
02:01:25.453 --> 02:01:26.870
She was crazy.

1687
02:01:27.828 --> 02:01:30.661
The tea-seller, Banwari,
wanted to marry her.


1688
02:01:31.078 --> 02:01:32.286
But she refused.

1689
02:01:33.453 --> 02:01:34.286
She'd say...

1690
02:01:35.453 --> 02:01:38.120
"This moron
will always be suspicious of me."


1691
02:01:38.786 --> 02:01:42.203
"Even if I go to the market,
he'd assume that I'm whoring around."


1692
02:01:46.161 --> 02:01:47.036
Come on,

1693
02:01:47.995 --> 02:01:49.536
it's time to take her away.

1694
02:01:53.953 --> 02:01:54.953
And...

1695
02:01:56.161 --> 02:01:57.953
tie her legs tightly.

1696
02:01:59.786 --> 02:02:02.870
Men cannot be trusted...
not even with a dead body.


1697
02:02:10.911 --> 02:02:12.453
My darling.

1698
02:02:35.620 --> 02:02:38.536
-Did you have fun, sir?
-I'll be back.


1699
02:02:41.953 --> 02:02:43.245
Hey, Mr. Fezi!

1700
02:02:43.328 --> 02:02:45.661
Oh, Ms. Gangu.

1701
02:02:45.745 --> 02:02:47.995
I went to the house
looking for you and you're here.


1702
02:02:48.078 --> 02:02:50.286
I'm seeing you after a very long time.
Sit down.


1703
02:02:51.911 --> 02:02:53.661
I have a surprise for you.

1704
02:02:53.995 --> 02:02:56.078
You'll be happy to see it.

1705
02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:57.953
I'll make you happier.

1706
02:02:58.161 --> 02:02:59.745
Just try the <i>bheja fry</i> here.

1707
02:02:59.870 --> 02:03:00.745
Hey, Birju!

1708
02:03:00.828 --> 02:03:02.078
Get Fezi a--

1709
02:03:11.786 --> 02:03:13.078
Mr. Fezi...

1710
02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:14.911
Show me, madam.

1711
02:03:14.995 --> 02:03:16.203
See this...

1712
02:03:18.370 --> 02:03:21.328
Wow! You look like a movie star!

1713
02:03:21.411 --> 02:03:23.578
Madhubala is nothing compared to you.

1714
02:03:23.661 --> 02:03:25.703
See how lovely our girls look.

1715
02:03:25.786 --> 02:03:26.953
See...

1716
02:03:27.745 --> 02:03:29.536
-Show me.
-Our madam is famous!


1717
02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:31.120
Use this to your advantage.

1718
02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:32.870
You're famous now.

1719
02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:35.620
And everyone listens to famous people.

1720
02:03:35.703 --> 02:03:36.870
What fame, Mr. Fezi?

1721
02:03:36.953 --> 02:03:38.703
I understand your pain,

1722
02:03:38.786 --> 02:03:41.328
but it's time for the world to know.

1723
02:03:41.911 --> 02:03:42.786
What do you mean?

1724
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:47.245
Next week, there's a huge rally
for women's rights at Azad Maidan.


1725
02:03:47.328 --> 02:03:51.286
Education for prostitutes is a topic too.
I've suggested your name to the committee.


1726
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:52.786
What should I do?

1727
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:53.995
Nothing much.

1728
02:03:54.370 --> 02:03:58.870
There'll be around 400-500 people,
you have to deliver a speech.


1729
02:03:58.953 --> 02:04:01.870
I can't be lured by all this.

1730
02:04:01.995 --> 02:04:03.620
I can't give speeches.

1731
02:04:03.703 --> 02:04:05.661
No, madam. You have to do this.

1732
02:04:05.745 --> 02:04:06.786
-Right?
-Yes.


1733
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:08.703
Who else speaks up on our behalf?

1734
02:04:08.786 --> 02:04:10.203
-Exactly.
-Yes.


1735
02:04:10.286 --> 02:04:14.161
And I've already written
something for you.


1736
02:04:14.828 --> 02:04:20.411
Memorize it, and blow everyone away
with your fiery speech.


1737
02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:24.745
"Greetings,
my dear brothers and sisters, I..."


1738
02:04:27.495 --> 02:04:28.620
What?

1739
02:04:31.036 --> 02:04:32.036
What is it?

1740
02:04:32.411 --> 02:04:33.661
Brothers?

1741
02:04:36.078 --> 02:04:37.328
Whose "brothers"?

1742
02:04:41.661 --> 02:04:42.828
Listen...

1743
02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:47.828
please reach Azad Maidan
at 4 pm on Wednesday.


1744
02:04:49.953 --> 02:04:51.245
Should I pick you up?

1745
02:04:52.328 --> 02:04:54.328
Why are you doing
all this for me, Fezi?

1746
02:04:55.495 --> 02:04:56.786
Because...

1747
02:05:06.661 --> 02:05:07.620
Let's go.

1748
02:05:07.703 --> 02:05:09.120
But where are you going?

1749
02:05:09.203 --> 02:05:12.745
Pammi needs to be fed,
and I have to memorize this speech.


1750
02:05:13.453 --> 02:05:16.661
Now that you're here,
enjoy the charms of Kamathipura.


1751
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:20.328
Girls, take extra care of Mr. Fezi.

1752
02:05:20.411 --> 02:05:22.411
-Sure, madam.
-Let's go, Birju!


1753
02:05:33.911 --> 02:05:35.036
No...

1754
02:05:39.578 --> 02:05:40.953
Madam...

1755
02:05:41.328 --> 02:05:42.870
Why do you call out
when I'm about to leave?


1756
02:05:42.995 --> 02:05:45.620
Fezi called,
asking why you haven't reached yet.


1757
02:05:45.703 --> 02:05:47.078
-Tell him I've left.
-Okay.


1758
02:05:47.161 --> 02:05:48.828
-You packed my glasses?
-Yes.


1759
02:05:48.911 --> 02:05:50.828
-My water bottle?
-Yes.


1760
02:05:50.911 --> 02:05:52.078
-Umbrella?
-Yes.


1761
02:05:52.161 --> 02:05:55.078
-Where's my speech, Birju?
-It's in your hand, madam!


1762
02:05:56.495 --> 02:06:00.078
Don't act too smart, idiot!
Get lost!


1763
02:06:00.620 --> 02:06:02.661
Madam sure is worked up today.

1764
02:06:04.703 --> 02:06:06.828
-What are you smiling at?
-Nothing.


1765
02:06:07.328 --> 02:06:10.120
You're going to give a speech,
seek God's blessings.


1766
02:06:10.203 --> 02:06:12.870
Dear God,
You've let me down so many times,


1767
02:06:12.953 --> 02:06:14.286
don't let me down today.

1768
02:06:15.078 --> 02:06:16.120
Come on, leave.

1769
02:06:16.203 --> 02:06:17.161
Hey, Gangu...

1770
02:06:19.536 --> 02:06:20.370
Be safe.

1771
02:06:20.453 --> 02:06:21.911
What have I gotten into!

1772
02:06:22.036 --> 02:06:23.995
My dear brothers and sisters, on...

1773
02:06:24.078 --> 02:06:25.078
What was it?

1774
02:06:25.203 --> 02:06:28.370
"Let me welcome the audience
on this auspicious day..."


1775
02:06:28.453 --> 02:06:30.203
Screw the audience!

1776
02:06:30.953 --> 02:06:34.828
Move it!
What are you waiting for? Buffoon.


1777
02:06:42.578 --> 02:06:45.495
Our society can progress
only when we are united,


1778
02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:50.828
all religions are seen as equal,
and women are given respect.


1779
02:06:54.370 --> 02:06:55.578
Great!

1780
02:06:56.161 --> 02:07:00.411
The progress of women from all walks
of life should be given importance.


1781
02:07:01.078 --> 02:07:05.911
After Mr. Minister's fiery speech,
the last speaker for this evening,


1782
02:07:06.411 --> 02:07:11.245
to talk about the rights of prostitutes,
is their representative,


1783
02:07:11.536 --> 02:07:15.870
Mrs... er, Miss...

1784
02:07:17.370 --> 02:07:19.245
It's okay, let it be...

1785
02:07:19.328 --> 02:07:21.120
-Lovely introduction...
-Sorry...


1786
02:07:21.203 --> 02:07:23.245
No, thank you for that.

1787
02:07:23.536 --> 02:07:26.745
She's confused about our title,
but we've been living with it.


1788
02:07:30.453 --> 02:07:33.745
I am Gangubai, President, Kamathipura.

1789
02:07:34.495 --> 02:07:37.661
They didn't let me be a "miss"
and nobody made me a "missus".


1790
02:07:45.203 --> 02:07:46.661
"Namaste..."

1791
02:07:46.745 --> 02:07:48.703
Hey, come here, you.

1792
02:07:50.703 --> 02:07:51.953
Get a chair!

1793
02:07:55.953 --> 02:07:57.495
Get it, darling.

1794
02:07:58.661 --> 02:08:00.745
Keep it here and lower the mic.

1795
02:08:05.661 --> 02:08:06.745
Now leave.

1796
02:08:09.203 --> 02:08:11.745
I'm not used to giving speeches.

1797
02:08:12.370 --> 02:08:14.078
I will say what's in my heart.

1798
02:08:14.661 --> 02:08:18.620
You might find my words
a little offensive but listen carefully.


1799
02:08:19.328 --> 02:08:20.370
You too...

1800
02:08:21.578 --> 02:08:23.578
the caretakers of our society!

1801
02:08:27.745 --> 02:08:29.411
I'll come to the point.

1802
02:08:32.161 --> 02:08:33.661
All of you...

1803
02:08:33.953 --> 02:08:36.911
all of you sitting here
must have some occupation...


1804
02:08:37.286 --> 02:08:38.453
business!

1805
02:08:38.536 --> 02:08:41.036
A doctor, an engineer or a teacher.

1806
02:08:41.495 --> 02:08:44.661
Some sell snacks,
alcohol, clothes, soap or utensils...


1807
02:08:44.745 --> 02:08:46.870
-Isn't it, Fezi?
-Yes.


1808
02:08:48.370 --> 02:08:52.161
A qualified person sells his intelligence
but we sell our bodies.


1809
02:08:52.703 --> 02:08:54.495
We work bloody hard!

1810
02:08:54.578 --> 02:08:55.745
What's wrong in that?

1811
02:08:59.828 --> 02:09:02.536
Why do they object
only to our establishments?


1812
02:09:03.161 --> 02:09:05.453
Why is only our profession
seen as immoral?


1813
02:09:06.578 --> 02:09:09.245
Men from your neighborhood come to ours

1814
02:09:09.328 --> 02:09:12.036
and yet our neighborhood is infamous. Why?

1815
02:09:14.245 --> 02:09:18.161
Do you know what the oldest
profession in the world is?


1816
02:09:19.995 --> 02:09:21.245
Prostitution.

1817
02:09:22.536 --> 02:09:24.828
Without us, even heaven is incomplete.

1818
02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:27.911
You must give us some respect,
don't you think?


1819
02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:33.370
To tell you the truth,

1820
02:09:34.245 --> 02:09:37.745
we have more dignity than you.
Ask me how.


1821
02:09:38.495 --> 02:09:40.828
You lose your dignity once,
it's gone forever.


1822
02:09:41.245 --> 02:09:43.078
We sell our dignity every night,

1823
02:09:43.745 --> 02:09:45.911
-yet it doesn't seem to run out.
-Bravo!


1824
02:09:50.578 --> 02:09:52.286
Enough of the photos.

1825
02:09:52.953 --> 02:09:54.245
Stop it already!

1826
02:09:56.078 --> 02:10:00.036
I'm not used to such bright lights.
I belong to the red light area!


1827
02:10:01.703 --> 02:10:03.036
No matter what you think,

1828
02:10:03.411 --> 02:10:05.620
we're women of integrity.

1829
02:10:05.703 --> 02:10:08.620
Sit down now, darling, enough of clicking!

1830
02:10:08.703 --> 02:10:10.953
I'll let you take my photos, sit down.

1831
02:10:15.036 --> 02:10:17.203
No matter who turns up at our doorstep,

1832
02:10:17.370 --> 02:10:19.245
we don't judge them.

1833
02:10:19.495 --> 02:10:20.953
It's our principle...

1834
02:10:21.536 --> 02:10:23.578
we don't ask your religion or caste.

1835
02:10:23.661 --> 02:10:26.036
Dark-skinned, light-skinned,

1836
02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:28.578
rich or poor, everyone pays the same rate.

1837
02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:32.495
When we don't discriminate
among people...


1838
02:10:32.578 --> 02:10:34.453
why do you discriminate against us?

1839
02:10:34.911 --> 02:10:37.203
Why are we excluded from your society?

1840
02:10:37.495 --> 02:10:38.453
True...

1841
02:10:41.661 --> 02:10:44.911
The minister who was preaching
about unity and equality...


1842
02:10:45.786 --> 02:10:47.578
Visit us sometime,

1843
02:10:48.036 --> 02:10:49.703
we practice what you preach!

1844
02:10:51.286 --> 02:10:53.786
Well said, Gangubai! Bravo!

1845
02:10:54.995 --> 02:10:59.620
Okay... It's not that we don't
matter to people, we do...


1846
02:11:00.161 --> 02:11:02.411
To politicians, we are their votes.

1847
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:06.286
To policemen, we're currency notes.
To men, we're winter coats.


1848
02:11:06.370 --> 02:11:07.453
And to women,

1849
02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:09.745
you all know who we are...

1850
02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:15.370
We have fire in us
and yet bloom like a rose.


1851
02:11:15.995 --> 02:11:19.911
We satisfy the lust of men
and protect the integrity of women.


1852
02:11:20.328 --> 02:11:22.953
Bravo! Bravo!

1853
02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:28.703
Just imagine...

1854
02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:31.953
if there was no Kamathipura...

1855
02:11:33.328 --> 02:11:35.286
this city would turn into a jungle!

1856
02:11:35.495 --> 02:11:38.495
Women will be raped,
families will fall apart,


1857
02:11:38.578 --> 02:11:42.703
relationships will end and our
glorious Indian culture will turn to dust.


1858
02:11:44.370 --> 02:11:46.620
And you will be responsible for this.

1859
02:11:48.620 --> 02:11:53.036
We guard not only your dignity
but also the dignity of this society.


1860
02:11:53.578 --> 02:11:56.078
That's why I'm as proud of being
a prostitute


1861
02:11:56.161 --> 02:11:58.620
as you are of being
a doctor or a teacher.

1862
02:12:04.203 --> 02:12:05.995
You are applauding my speech,

1863
02:12:06.745 --> 02:12:08.578
but it's funny

1864
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:13.078
that you're still hell bent
on making us homeless.


1865
02:12:13.828 --> 02:12:17.495
And if that's not enough, you want
to throw our children out of school too.


1866
02:12:19.536 --> 02:12:22.745
I want to ask you all something.
Answer truthfully.


1867
02:12:23.745 --> 02:12:27.203
Don't our children have
the right to education? Huh?


1868
02:12:28.453 --> 02:12:32.495
Aren't our children,
like your children, the future of India?


1869
02:12:32.578 --> 02:12:34.703
Yes! Yes!

1870
02:12:34.786 --> 02:12:35.828
They are!

1871
02:12:35.911 --> 02:12:38.828
And so, Gangu has decided...

1872
02:12:39.370 --> 02:12:42.286
I won't let the women
of Kamathipura become homeless.


1873
02:12:42.661 --> 02:12:45.453
Our children
will get the right to education


1874
02:12:45.536 --> 02:12:48.995
and we will get our right
to live in society with dignity.


1875
02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:57.411
So, my dear audience...

1876
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:59.911
I end my speech here.

1877
02:13:01.203 --> 02:13:02.036
Mr. Fezi...

1878
02:13:04.078 --> 02:13:05.911
Write in tomorrow's newspaper...

1879
02:13:07.036 --> 02:13:09.578
Gangubai made a speech at Azad Maidan

1880
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:12.578
not with her eyes downcast,

1881
02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:15.661
but with her head held high!

1882
02:13:16.036 --> 02:13:20.078
Bravo!

1883
02:13:57.328 --> 02:13:58.536
Ms. Gangu.

1884
02:14:00.036 --> 02:14:01.411
Mr. Patil is here.

1885
02:14:02.245 --> 02:14:03.870
He's the local politician.

1886
02:14:05.161 --> 02:14:08.411
I got him after much coaxing.
He was scared to come here.


1887
02:14:09.245 --> 02:14:10.953
Of course he's scared, Fezi.

1888
02:14:11.453 --> 02:14:14.661
When gentlemen like him
visit our brothel, we gain respect


1889
02:14:15.328 --> 02:14:16.536
but they lose theirs.

1890
02:14:19.536 --> 02:14:20.661
Sit down.

1891
02:14:21.703 --> 02:14:24.745
Gangubai, you have a way with words.

1892
02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:27.495
Everyone is talking about your speech.

1893
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:29.911
And what good will that do?

1894
02:14:30.828 --> 02:14:33.786
I don't want to be talked about, sir.
I want change.


1895
02:14:34.203 --> 02:14:35.161
Birju!

1896
02:14:35.245 --> 02:14:36.953
-Get some sherbet.
-Yes, madam.


1897
02:14:37.286 --> 02:14:38.120
Tell me,

1898
02:14:38.495 --> 02:14:39.661
what can I do for you?

1899
02:14:39.745 --> 02:14:41.786
Elections are around the corner.

1900
02:14:42.078 --> 02:14:43.161
-Kamathipura--
-Birju!


1901
02:14:43.245 --> 02:14:45.620
-Get the green sherbet.
-Yes.


1902
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:48.370
Not just Kamathipura,

1903
02:14:48.786 --> 02:14:51.661
the stretch from Dongri
to Byculla is your domain.


1904
02:14:51.745 --> 02:14:53.578
Not just Byculla, Mr. Patil.

1905
02:14:53.995 --> 02:14:55.620
She has her hold up to Dharavi!

1906
02:14:57.286 --> 02:14:59.953
Our party is lacking support this time...

1907
02:15:00.036 --> 02:15:01.120
I forgot to ask,

1908
02:15:01.203 --> 02:15:03.911
would you like ice in your drink,
or room temperature is fine?


1909
02:15:03.995 --> 02:15:05.536
Ice.

1910
02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:06.786
Birju!

1911
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:08.870
Add ice to Mr. 
Patil's sherbet.

1912
02:15:09.370 --> 02:15:10.661
-Yes, madam.
-Hmm.


1913
02:15:10.745 --> 02:15:14.620
-If you could lend us your support--
-Why?


1914
02:15:15.453 --> 02:15:16.953
What have you done for us?

1915
02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:19.953
You're asking for our votes,

1916
02:15:20.036 --> 02:15:22.870
when thousands of women here
will become homeless


1917
02:15:23.495 --> 02:15:26.245
because of this school's tantrums!

1918
02:15:26.328 --> 02:15:27.328
Gangubai...

1919
02:15:28.078 --> 02:15:30.453
they've escalated
the matter to the Center.


1920
02:15:30.911 --> 02:15:33.411
They've submitted
a petition in Supreme Court.


1921
02:15:33.495 --> 02:15:34.995
We can't do anything now.

1922
02:15:35.078 --> 02:15:37.203
Why the hell isn't the sherbet here yet!

1923
02:15:42.411 --> 02:15:43.370
Mr. Patil,

1924
02:15:44.078 --> 02:15:45.078
forget it!

1925
02:15:45.536 --> 02:15:47.620
What I meant was...

1926
02:15:47.703 --> 02:15:51.370
it now relies on the Supreme Court
or the Prime Minister.


1927
02:15:52.370 --> 02:15:55.453
How can I meet everyone
in the Supreme Court, Fezi?


1928
02:15:56.328 --> 02:15:58.745
Arrange a meeting with the Prime Minister.

1929
02:16:00.453 --> 02:16:01.536
Okay, Mr. Patil.

1930
02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:03.078
If you can't do it, I'll--

1931
02:16:03.161 --> 02:16:05.245
No, no, please don't be upset, Gangubai.

1932
02:16:05.661 --> 02:16:07.620
I'll do something, I'll try.

1933
02:16:07.703 --> 02:16:10.078
Help me win this election

1934
02:16:10.411 --> 02:16:12.453
and I'll arrange your trip to Delhi.

1935
02:16:12.911 --> 02:16:14.870
In that case...

1936
02:16:15.245 --> 02:16:17.411
Victory to Mr. Patil!

1937
02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:20.661
Thank you, Gangubai. Thank you.

1938
02:16:20.745 --> 02:16:21.870
I'll leave.

1939
02:16:21.953 --> 02:16:24.411
But you haven't had the sherbet.

1940
02:16:24.495 --> 02:16:26.620
I will, when you're back from Delhi!

1941
02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:46.245
Ms. Gangu...

1942
02:16:46.661 --> 02:16:48.661
I'm glad you're here, Fezi.

1943
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:51.578
I was wondering what to pack,
a shawl or sweater?


1944
02:16:51.661 --> 02:16:53.120
It's cold in Delhi--

1945
02:16:53.203 --> 02:16:54.703
You won't need it.

1946
02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:55.953
Why?

1947
02:16:56.036 --> 02:16:58.328
The Prime Minister
has canceled the meeting.


1948
02:17:02.911 --> 02:17:03.745
Birju!

1949
02:17:03.953 --> 02:17:04.786
Come here.

1950
02:17:05.245 --> 02:17:06.453
Yes, madam?

1951
02:17:06.745 --> 02:17:08.620
Distribute these sweets.

1952
02:17:08.703 --> 02:17:10.828
-But--
-The trip to Delhi is canceled!


1953
02:17:11.828 --> 02:17:13.786
Men should never be trusted.

1954
02:17:13.870 --> 02:17:15.078
I was joking...

1955
02:17:15.578 --> 02:17:17.495
the letter from Delhi just arrived.

1956
02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:20.786
What a terrible joke!

1957
02:17:21.203 --> 02:17:22.953
I was so scared, Fezi.

1958
02:17:23.036 --> 02:17:26.161
I've been worried and anxious
about my Delhi trip.


1959
02:17:26.245 --> 02:17:27.620
Why are you anxious?

1960
02:17:30.203 --> 02:17:31.828
Fezi, 15 years...

1961
02:17:32.745 --> 02:17:35.911
I haven't stepped out
of Kamathipura in 15 years!


1962
02:17:36.411 --> 02:17:37.786
What stopped you?

1963
02:17:40.286 --> 02:17:41.745
A hope...

1964
02:17:43.786 --> 02:17:46.828
that I might meet him
in these lanes someday...


1965
02:17:49.078 --> 02:17:50.495
Ramnik.

1966
02:17:50.703 --> 02:17:53.536
But I hope that you never meet him.

1967
02:17:54.995 --> 02:17:56.911
Because the day you meet him...

1968
02:17:57.953 --> 02:18:00.120
from Gangubai,
you will become Ganga again!


1969
02:18:01.703 --> 02:18:03.828
This fire within you

1970
02:18:04.828 --> 02:18:07.578
that makes you fight
and think for people...


1971
02:18:08.328 --> 02:18:09.578
will get extinguished.

1972
02:18:10.495 --> 02:18:12.786
Forget the past, think of the future.

1973
02:18:13.786 --> 02:18:18.578
The Prime Minister will meet you at 4 pm
in his office, only for 15 minutes.


1974
02:18:20.703 --> 02:18:21.703
That is enough.

1975
02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:28.328
I'll change my name if I don't win
that rose from him in 15 minutes!


1976
02:18:48.828 --> 02:18:50.036
Madam.

1977
02:18:50.703 --> 02:18:52.120
Are you sleeping, madam?

1978
02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:53.203
Yes.

1979
02:18:53.703 --> 02:18:56.661
I can't sleep.
It's my first time traveling by train!


1980
02:18:57.786 --> 02:18:58.995
It's my second time.

1981
02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:04.453
The first time, destiny brought me
straight from Kathiawar to Kamathipura.


1982
02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:09.370
And today... I'm headed straight
to the Prime Minister's office!


1983
02:19:09.453 --> 02:19:12.620
Everyone in the neighborhood
will respect us after this.


1984
02:19:13.745 --> 02:19:16.120
I'll show Pappu my
photo when we get back.

1985
02:19:16.203 --> 02:19:18.911
Madam! Do get a photo clicked with him,

1986
02:19:18.995 --> 02:19:21.120
or no one will believe we met him.

1987
02:19:30.161 --> 02:19:31.036
Madam.

1988
02:19:31.495 --> 02:19:32.870
Please take your seat.

1989
02:19:32.995 --> 02:19:35.578
-The Prime Minister will be here shortly.
-Yes.


1990
02:19:40.828 --> 02:19:44.161
-Namaste, Gangubai. Please sit.
-Namaste, Mr. Prime Minister.


1991
02:19:48.578 --> 02:19:51.370
-I hope you had a comfortable journey.
-I did.


1992
02:19:52.453 --> 02:19:53.953
-Have some tea.
-Thank you.


1993
02:19:54.245 --> 02:19:56.370
-You have some too?
-Later.


1994
02:19:57.703 --> 02:19:59.245
I've heard a lot about you, Gangubai.

1995
02:20:00.370 --> 02:20:03.286
What you've done for downtrodden
women is commendable.


1996
02:20:03.953 --> 02:20:06.411
Your fight against injustice
is a noble one.


1997
02:20:06.495 --> 02:20:08.453
My father taught me all this.

1998
02:20:08.536 --> 02:20:09.828
He was a barrister too.

1999
02:20:10.078 --> 02:20:11.370
Mr. Jagjeevandas.

2000
02:20:12.245 --> 02:20:14.870
First of all, I
want to thank you, sir,

2001
02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:17.453
for taking the time to meet me.

2002
02:20:17.536 --> 02:20:18.870
No need to thank me.

2003
02:20:18.995 --> 02:20:21.703
It's my duty to meet people
and grant them their rights.


2004
02:20:22.161 --> 02:20:23.370
Yes.

2005
02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:25.953
That's what I have come for...

2006
02:20:27.495 --> 02:20:28.703
Go on.

2007
02:20:31.370 --> 02:20:33.870
Legalize prostitution!

2008
02:20:36.078 --> 02:20:37.828
That is impossible, Gangubai.

2009
02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:40.995
Prostitution is not
for the welfare of society.


2010
02:20:42.161 --> 02:20:44.995
But as long as society exists,
so will prostitution.


2011
02:20:45.745 --> 02:20:48.245
As we speak,

2012
02:20:48.453 --> 02:20:51.620
some girl is being sold off
or someone is buying her.


2013
02:20:52.078 --> 02:20:54.245
The seller and buyer should be punished,

2014
02:20:54.328 --> 02:20:56.120
but who gets the punishment?

2015
02:20:56.661 --> 02:20:58.120
That innocent girl.

2016
02:21:00.953 --> 02:21:02.620
I can understand your pain.

2017
02:21:03.036 --> 02:21:04.286
No, sir.

2018
02:21:04.578 --> 02:21:08.453
No one can understand what we go through.
Not even God Himself.


2019
02:21:10.995 --> 02:21:13.995
All our rights
have been taken away from us.


2020
02:21:14.578 --> 02:21:16.203
Be it a school or a hospital,

2021
02:21:16.328 --> 02:21:18.286
bank or queue at a grocery store...

2022
02:21:18.661 --> 02:21:20.786
A mother's love, a father's protection,

2023
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:22.995
we are deprived of it all.

2024
02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:27.078
Now even our home
is being taken away from us.


2025
02:21:27.495 --> 02:21:29.453
They want us to vacate Kamathipura.

2026
02:21:29.620 --> 02:21:32.120
They have even dragged us to court!

2027
02:21:33.536 --> 02:21:35.703
Have faith in the law.

2028
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:38.328
It always supports the truth.

2029
02:21:38.995 --> 02:21:40.578
Which law?

2030
02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:43.745
We're the victim
and yet treated as a criminal.


2031
02:21:48.828 --> 02:21:50.953
The daughter of Eve needs help.

2032
02:21:52.536 --> 02:21:55.495
The likes of Yashoda,
the daughter of Radha.


2033
02:21:56.745 --> 02:21:59.495
The prophet's nation,
the daughter of Zulekha.


2034
02:22:00.786 --> 02:22:03.411
Those who are proud
of this country, where are they?


2035
02:22:10.661 --> 02:22:11.745
Okay.

2036
02:22:12.245 --> 02:22:15.078
I will set up a committee
and discuss this matter.


2037
02:22:17.328 --> 02:22:18.536
Thank you.

2038
02:22:19.828 --> 02:22:22.286
-Can I ask you something, Gangubai?
-Yes.


2039
02:22:22.370 --> 02:22:24.786
Don't you want
to set up a home of your own,


2040
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:26.328
away from this world?

2041
02:22:26.411 --> 02:22:30.286
The truth is that the 4,000 women
in Kamathipura are my family.


2042
02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:32.286
I live in their hearts.

2043
02:22:34.870 --> 02:22:35.870
Okay.

2044
02:22:36.328 --> 02:22:38.661
I'll make sure
your homes are not taken away.


2045
02:22:40.411 --> 02:22:42.328
And our legal rights as well...

2046
02:22:54.286 --> 02:22:56.953
Have you ever seen black roses,
Mr. Prime Minister?


2047
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:58.995
Black roses?

2048
02:22:59.495 --> 02:23:00.578
Do they even exist?

2049
02:23:01.870 --> 02:23:02.786
They do.

2050
02:23:03.786 --> 02:23:05.578
Visit our neighborhood sometime,

2051
02:23:06.245 --> 02:23:08.370
you'll find a garden filled with them.

2052
02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:18.745
Long live India!

2053
02:23:19.328 --> 02:23:20.411
Long live India!

2054
02:23:33.745 --> 02:23:35.995
<i>As long as Gangubai was alive,</i>

2055
02:23:37.245 --> 02:23:39.661
<i>the garden of black roses thrived...</i>

2056
02:23:41.411 --> 02:23:43.161
<i>Gangubai was no saint</i>

2057
02:23:44.161 --> 02:23:46.078
<i>but she was no devil either.</i>

2058
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:55.953
<i>People like Gangu will not be</i>
<i>mentioned in history,</i>


2059
02:23:58.745 --> 02:24:01.453
<i>but these lanes have a way</i>
<i>of remembering history.</i>


2060
02:24:03.245 --> 02:24:04.786
<i>And these lanes tell us,</i>

2061
02:24:06.036 --> 02:24:10.661
<i>as long as Gangubai lived, not a single</i>
<i>woman in Kamathipura went homeless.</i>


2062
02:24:13.828 --> 02:24:16.870
<i>White sari, a golden tooth,</i>

2063
02:24:18.578 --> 02:24:20.453
<i>and a woman with a golden heart...</i>

2064
02:24:22.036 --> 02:24:24.495
<i>Gangubai Jagjeevandas Kathiawadi.</i>

2065
02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:31.828
<i>The woman who tried</i>
<i>to legalize prostitution.</i>


2066
02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:37.328
<i>Who gave women dignity</i>
<i>in an undignified place,</i>


2067
02:24:39.911 --> 02:24:42.953
<i>and taught them to breathe freely</i>
<i>in stifling cages.</i>


2068
02:25:05.078 --> 02:25:08.078
<i>The color of gratitude</i>

2069
02:25:08.578 --> 02:25:12.161
<i>and celebration that day was white...</i>

2070
02:25:12.453 --> 02:25:14.036
<i>Gangu's white.</i>

2071
02:25:19.453 --> 02:25:22.578
LONG LIVE GANGUBAI

2072
02:25:24.661 --> 02:25:28.620
<i>Some called her a Mafia Queen,</i>
<i>while others called her a sister.</i>


2073
02:25:32.578 --> 02:25:37.245
<i>A friend to someone,</i>
<i>and a mother to some...</i>


2074
02:25:40.578 --> 02:25:43.286
LONG LIVE GANGUBAI

2075
02:27:17.911 --> 02:27:19.120
GANGUBAI

2076
02:27:19.203 --> 02:27:22.245
<i>Movie stars' posters come</i>
