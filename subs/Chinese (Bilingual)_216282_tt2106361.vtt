00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.050
新线电影公司

2
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.150
嘿，给我一瓶
Hey, pass the bottle over.


3
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.790
- 我正在忙好吗?  - 是阿,我们都知道,大卫
- A little busy back here. Okay?  - Yeah, we can see that, David.


4
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.470
是的,你一点都不忙.
Yeah, you can get un-busy.


5
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.870
哦，别这样马西雅。我们翘掉毕业典礼到这地方，你知道我的意思
Oh, come on, Marce. I mean, you know,  we skipped graduation for this.


6
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.190
你还没从处男毕业，大卫.布罗迪
You are not graduating  down there, David Brody.


7
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.990
嘿，你最好不要拍我们。
Hey, you better not be filming us.


8
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.590
没有，我在检查简讯而已
No, just checking messages.


9
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.830
Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head

10
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.359
那是什么?
What was that?


11
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.070
- 你有看到吗?  - 什么?
- Do you see that?  - What?


12
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.355
你们有看到吗?
Man. You guys seeing this?


13
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.950
- 哇 嘿 比利  - 哇 嘿~ 嘿~ 嘿~
- Whoa. Hey, Billy.  - Whoa. Ho-ho-ho.


14
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.590
等等
Hang on.


15
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.790
- 我们该走了.  - 等一下，我得把这拍下来
- We should go.  - I gotta get this. Hang on.


16
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.310
- 可以走了吗?  - 快走吧。我们快走
- Can we go?  - Come on, let's go.


17
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.990
- 好的 等一下  - 进来!
- Yeah. Hold on.  - Get in!


18
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.950
知道了!给我一分钟
I will! Just give me one minute!


19
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.230
- 快进来!  - 看见了吗?
- Come on!  - Are you seeing this?


20
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.320
- 哇!  - 比利 快走吧!
- Whoa!  - Billy, get in!


21
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.990
天啊! 是龙卷风!
Oh, shit! Tornado!


22
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.950
天啊!
Oh, my God!


23
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.310
快跑 快点离开
Get us out of here. Go!


24
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.230
不 惧 风 暴

25
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.230
龙卷风昨夜袭击了俄克拉荷马州北部地区...
The tornado that struck  Oklahoma last night...


26
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.310
四名高中生在袭击中丧生...
took the lives of four  high school students...


27
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.350
他们的汽车被卷到几百英里外的高空中
when it picked up their car  and tossed it into the air.


28
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.310
龙卷风虽然在中西部地区很常见...
Tornadoes in this region of the Midwest  are common, but it only took a glance...


29
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.870
但是我们看到此次明显非同小可
to know this was different.


30
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.550
它并不是一条细长的风柱而更像一头在夜空中嘶吼的巨兽
Not so much a twisting  column but a behemoth.


31
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.471
太好了 我们又没有赶上
Great. We missed another one.


32
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.590
嘿 大家不会不知道拍纪录片的目的...
Hey, you guys know the  goal of a documentary...


33
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.630
是要记录点什么吧?
is to actually document  something, right?


34
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.230
收到
Copy that.


35
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.550
我们得找到龙卷风
We need a tornado.


36
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.310
没错 得找到龙卷风  我们上次拍是什么时候 卢卡斯?
That's it. We need a tornado. Yeah.  When was the last time we shot one, Lucas?


37
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.950
一年前为气象频道拍的4级龙卷风
That EF4 that we shot a year ago.


38
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.230
是啊 一年了 365天 一无所获
Right. A year ago.  So we're 0 for 365.


39
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.350
这工作快干不下去了  雅各布 你是打棒球吗?
Let's figure that average. Hey,  Jacob, you play baseball. Right?


40
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.790
- 打曲棍球  - 是吗？ 我玩长曲棍球
- Hockey, actually.  - Yeah? I played lacrosse.


41
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.870
- 真的假的  - 真是搞笑 简直就像家庭旅游
- Really? No way.  - This is fun. It's like a family road trip.


42
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.190
- 我说错什么了?  - 是的，雅各布
- Did I miss something?  - Yeah, Jacob.


43
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.270
你不是说错了  而是错过了
You missed everything.


44
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.630
不 没有错过. 我们花了200小时欣赏日落...
No. Except we do have 200  hours of cloud sunsets...


45
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.390
我们还从爱达荷州一路飙车到德克萨斯州
and us going to every drive-through  from Idaho to Texas.


46
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.836
这家庭纪录片简直堪称史上最昂贵的
Which makes this the most  expensive home movie ever.


47
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.390
得先说清楚了
Just to be clear...


48
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.800
找不到龙卷风我们的钱也不会少吧?
we're gonna get paid whether  we see a tornado or not, right?


49
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.431
对吧?
Right?


50
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.158
我们现在去哪，老大?
Where do you wanna go, boss?


51
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.230
我也不知道 达里尔.  我的工作就是负责拍它们...
I have no idea, Daryl.  My job is to shoot them...


52
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.590
...可不负责找它们
...not find them.


53
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.870
- 他心情不好啊
- He's upset.  - What else is new?


54
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.750
接连着抱怨了三个月，我都已经习惯了
Three months of that  broken record. I'm over it.


55
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.070
真庆幸我俩没在他的Titus里窝着
Just be thankful we're in here  and not in the Titus.


56
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.270
- 在那儿肯定惨了  - 没关对讲机 天才们
- Must be brutal in there.  - You left the radio on, genius.


57
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.710
糟糕
Shit.


58
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.750
这下他的心情应该更不好了
That probably didn't help his mood.


59
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.990
他的情绪是小事 龙卷风才是大事
Screw his mood.  We've got other problems.


60
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.590
我们真的没法预测昨天晚上的龙卷风会刮到哪去
There's no way we could have known  that tornado was gonna hit.


61
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.270
国家气象局发布了龙卷风警报...
The National Weather Service  has issued a tornado watch...


62
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.190
德州、俄克拉荷马州、堪萨斯州、阿肯色州、密苏里州境内
throughout Texas, Oklahoma,  Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri.


63
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.510
彼得，国家气象局刚刚针对五个州发布了龙卷风警报
Pete. National Weather posted a  tornado watch across five states.


64
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.190
增长很快 移动速度惊人
Front's growing and moving fast.


65
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.430
我想距离我们以北200英里
I think this thing's gonna hit  about 200 miles north of here.


66
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.790
那我们也得加快了
Then we better haul ass.


67
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.510
如果我们跟它撞个正着 你这一天就不好过了
If you're in the path of this storm,  you could be in for a very long day.


68
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.790
嘿!今天是6月16日...
Hey. So today is June 16th...


69
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.310
这是我给未来自己的时光胶囊
and this is my time capsule  message to the future me.


70
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.910
恩... 记录下来之后将封存25年...
Um... This is gonna be recorded  and stored for 25 years...


71
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.401
当你 41岁的唐尼.福勒看到这个...
when you, the 41-year-old  Donnie Fuller, will...


72
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.190
该怎么说呢 就会回想起这时的生活
I don't know, see how  life's panned out, I guess.


73
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.910
嗯...
Uh...


74
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.270
那个时候爸爸65岁
By now Dad is 65.


75
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.599
那妈妈就会是...
So Mom would have been...


76
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.070
妈妈会是63岁了
Mom would have been 63.


77
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.160
嗯...
Um...


78
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.150
还有什么? 你现在是西威尔顿高级中学高中生
What else? You're a junior  at Silverton High School.


79
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.270
你是摄影俱乐部的老大 听起来很棒嘛!
You're head of the Video Club,  which is awesome.


80
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.755
应该...
And...


81
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.150
差不多就这样
And that's pretty much it.


82
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.510
看 这就是唐尼之家...
So this is Casa de Donnie...


83
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.990
你在这里的大部分时间...
Where you spend most your time...


84
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.830
那是盯着学校纪念册里 凯特琳.强森的照片发呆.
staring at the photo of Kaitlyn  Johnston and doing nothing.


85
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.830
- 这是特雷 讨人嫌的弟弟  - 我们彼此彼此
- This is Trey, your annoying brother.  - Respect to you too.


86
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.630
等你看见这个的时候 特雷肯定正在监狱呆着呢
By the time you see this,  Trey's gonna be in the state pen.


87
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.790
嘿.别闹了，那时我肯定是在麦迪逊广场花园  对着十万的粉丝狂飙吉他
Heh. No way. I will be playing lead guitar  to 100,000 fans in Madison Square Garden.


88
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.554
但是你...肯定还会在这老地方 对着她的照片呻吟
But you will be stuck right here,  moaning over her.


89
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.150
这是爸爸。他是西威尔顿中学的副校长...
This is Dad. He's the vice principal  at Silverton High School...


90
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.030
这对我来说可不是什么好事
which is not the greatest for me.


91
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.390
- 嗯, 老爸  - 嗯?
- Uh, Dad?  - Hmm?


92
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.960
嘿!别拍了 我正在吃早餐
Hey, come on.  I'm having breakfast here.


93
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.470
- 特雷 5分钟后出发 准备好了吗?  - 别着急
- Trey, I am leaving in five, ready or not.  - Relax!


94
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.630
爸，要对未来说点什么吗?
Wanna say something to  the future you, Dad?


95
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.070
不， 唐尼 看不出来我今天很忙吗?
Not now, Donnie, okay?  Busy day. Can't you see that?


96
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.430
爸爸，之前你...
Dad, you're the one...


97
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.270
不是要我先拍摄这些时光胶囊的吗?
that wanted these video-time-capsule  pieces in the first place.


98
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.710
这鬼天气会把毕业典礼给搞砸了
This weather's gonna kill  the graduation ceremony.


99
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.230
我们应该延期举行
We should postpone it.


100
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.670
好了，这是时光胶囊纪录的第二版
Okay. This is time-capsule  interview, version number two.


101
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.630
我是什么样的人?  这是一个很难回答的问题
What kind of man am I?  That's a hard question to answer.


102
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.070
我是说 完美这个词 简直就是为我而创造的
I mean, how do you  describe perfection?


103
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.150
我以为你早拍摄完了
I thought you did your  interview already.


104
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.390
没错 昨天下午就拍完了
I did. Yesterday.


105
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.390
但是我突然想起来在晨光中我会显得更帅
But then I remembered I look  way better in the morning light.


106
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.390
加油呀 老爸
Lift with your legs, Dad.


107
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.190
孩子们 过来帮帮我
Come on, guys, I could use some help.


108
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.670
老爸 我爱莫能助 我的背上有踢球时留下的旧伤
Ah, man, I can't. That old  soccer-injury thing with my back.


109
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.590
- 是吗? 这些都录进去了?  - 是的
- Yeah? You get all that?  - I did.


110
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.910
很好 快上车
Good. Get in.


111
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.591
抢位置!
Shotgun!


112
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.630
- 唐尼 一起走  - 我骑脚踏车去
- Donnie, let's go.  - I'm taking my bike.


113
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.750
老哥 你想坐前座让给你好了
Dude. Chill. If you  want shotgun, just take it.


114
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.550
嘿, 我很抱歉，但龙卷风和毕业典礼让我忙得焦头烂额
Hey, I'm sorry. With the storm and  graduation today, I got a lot on my plate.


115
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.630
- 我知道 你总是忙 我早习惯了  - 这话什么意思?
- I know. It's always something. I'm used to it.  - What does that mean?


116
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.110
你别总是要么忽视我 要么盯着我不放
It means you're either  ignoring me or on my case.


117
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.430
- 不是这样的  - 不是说我房间乱 就是说我成绩差
- That's not true.  - If it's not my room, it's my grades.


118
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.790
努力去做什么傻呼呼的时光胶囊 你又不当一回事
Or it's this time capsule, which I'm  working my ass off to get done.


119
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.710
这样有什么意义? 你永远都不会满意
No. What's the point?  Nothing's ever good enough for you.


120
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.390
等等，我们好好谈一谈
Stop for second. Let's talk.


121
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.310
不行 我很忙。看不出来吗? 爸爸
No. Busy day, Dad.  Can't you see that?


122
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.790
好吧, 老爸 老爸
All right, Dad. Dad.


123
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.030
别想太多 凭你的直觉马上说出来
Right at this moment... Don't even think  about it before you answer. Just blurt it out.


124
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.470
...哪个是你最喜欢的儿子?
...who is your favorite son?


125
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.356
你给我上车
Get in the car.


126
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.236
来了
Well.


127
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.950
我知道昨晚我们错过了，没能及时赶到现场
I know we missed it last night.  We couldn't get there in time.


128
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.360
是啊 我知道
Yeah. I know. I know.


129
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.070
如果你撤资 我就完蛋了
Well, if you pull my funding,  that's it for me.


130
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.630
而且这次追的是个大家伙.
And we're onto a big one.


131
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.470
我不知道有多大，史帝夫 那是龙卷风
I don't know how big. It's a tornado.


132
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.110
它们不会事先打电话告诉我有多大
They don't call to tell me  how big they're gonna be.


133
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.750
总之风暴前缘很大 正穿过那个地区
There's a massive storm front  moving through the area.


134
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.910
我们一定会找到它的
We're gonna get it.  We just don't have it yet.


135
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.230
呃，让她来可是你的主意?
Uh, well, she was your idea.


136
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.470
我要的是大卫 你没忘吧?
I wanted David Sinclair, remember?


137
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.279
就算没有艾莉森和她的数据，我也快成功了
Yeah. Well, I was getting a lot  closer without Allison and her data.


138
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.910
这可是个玩直觉的游戏
It's an instinct game.


139
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.319
她只懂数据
And she ain't got it.


140
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.670
嘿，雅各布 能帮个忙?
Hey, Jacob. A little help?


141
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.870
- 不行啊 如果我停下来 彼得会炒了我的
- I can't. If I stop filming, Pete's gonna fire me.  - Dude.


142
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.710
你可别白受他的气
Don't you dare let him bully you.


143
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.830
你说的容易，又不是你坐在他旁边
Easy for you to say. You're not  the one sitting next to him.


144
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.150
这次有意思吗?
You having fun yet?


145
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.910
是的 老兄，这比坎昆那次有意思多了
Oh, yeah, dude. This is so  much better than Cancun.


146
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.190
跟你说吧 去年我们离它就一百码的距离
I'm telling you, last year  we got within 100 yards.


147
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.430
那景象真是叹为观止 相信我
It's like nothing you've  seen before. Trust me.


148
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.790
好吧 你看，更大规模的正如预计的在向河岸移动
Okay, so larger system is moving  toward Riverside as predicted.


149
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.350
我觉得我们应该去这边
I think we should go here.


150
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.350
风速和降水指数对形成龙卷风来说是不错的数值
The wind and precipitation readings in  the trailing cell look better for a funnel.


151
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.910
之前莫里斯敦和奥斯古德地区的龙卷风 你也这样说
Exactly what you said about  Morristown and Osgood.


152
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.590
- 不，这次不一样  - 有什么不一样?
This one's different. It's not following  the pattern. It's growing faster.


153
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:31.790
这不是普通的情况 这次增长非常快
It's growing faster.


154
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.150
而且 夏威夷这边所有的风暴迷都去了河岸边
Every storm chaser this side of  Hawaii is going to Riverside.


155
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.070
我想说的是 我觉得我们也该去那边
Which, by the way, is where  I think we should go.


156
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.230
你想我们去哪? 西威尔顿?
But you want us to  go where? Silverton?


157
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.150
我知道你是把这个当成和直觉有关的东西  而不是和数据有关的东西
If you would like, consider this an  instinct thing instead of a data thing.


158
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.030
如果你听到了我说的   那你一定也听到了史帝夫想撤资
If you heard that, then you also  heard that Steve cut us off.


159
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.270
- 现在我在用自己的钱  - 我是听到了
- And it's on my dime now.  - I heard that.


160
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.550
你也跟我们在路上跑了三个月
This is months on the road.  And guess what.


161
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.910
结果是我们拍到的东西Youtube上都有，我讨厌现在的情况
We got nothing you can't get on YouTube.  Worst season I've ever had.


162
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.470
你觉得这是个直觉游戏，我觉得这是个数据游戏
You think this is instinct.  I think it's data.


163
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.590
而实际上 这两种都不是，这其实是个运气游戏
The fact is, it's neither  without a big fat dose of luck.


164
00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:06.310
老天给的运气我可控制不了，好吗?
And there is nothing I  can do about that. Okay?


165
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.750
我们别再争执了
So back off of me.


166
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.630
我只想让你和你的数据  给我找到一个该死的龙卷风
I just want you and your data  to find me a goddamn tornado.


167
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.597
西威尔顿就是我们的机会
Then Silverton's our best chance.


168
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:20.677
你怎么想的?
What do you think?


169
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.750
她是这方面的权威
She's the one with all the degrees.


170
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.556
我赌她赢
My money's on her.


171
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.920
那就去西威尔顿
Silverton it is.


172
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.790
最好这次你是对的
You better be right about this.


173
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.470
- 这是你最后的机会  - 好吧
- It's your last chance.  - Wow.


174
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.990
等等 等等 好了
Yeah, okay. Hang on. Okay. It's okay.


175
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.590
好了 我们开始录了吗?
All right. We recording?


176
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.150
- 感觉很不错?  - 准备好了吗?
- We're good?  - You ready?


177
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.070
- 超级好 老兄  - 好的 开始吧!
- Hell, yeah, man!  - Yeah! Get fired up!


178
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.710
- 我准备好了
- I'm ready!  - You ready for this shit?


179
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.270
或许我们应该找几个小妞来看这个特技 对吧?
Maybe we should get some  girls to watch this stunt, huh?


180
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.150
这就是我说的猛男啦啦队!  该大显身手了，宝贝
That's what I'm talking about. Get fired up!  Let's go for real! It's go time!


181
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.270
- 来吧 来吧  - 安全第一
- Let's go, let's go!  - Safety first.


182
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.270
开始吧，先试一次好吗? 快让开 混蛋
Okay, just do a test run first,  all right? Move, jackass!


183
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:03.192
- 都给我闪开 我要冲过去了  - 来吧 你行的 兄弟
- Get out of the way. Here we go.  - Come on. Yeah. You got it, buddy.


184

- 加油 兄弟  - 加油 唐克 来吧 兄弟
- Come on, buddy!  - Come on, Donk! Let's go, boy!


185
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.393
他在测试速度呢
He's gonna check the  speed on this one.


186
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.110
兄弟 来吧 上啊
Yeah! Do it, bro!


187
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.030
- 开起来  - 来个试跳
- Let's go!  - Test drive!


188
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.200
来个试跳 来呀
Let's go for the test drive!


189
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.390
你去哪，唐克!
There you go, Donkie!


190
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.150
你看起来相当不错，有什么感想?
Well, that looked pretty good to me.  What do you think?


191
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.430
嗯...
Eh.


192
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.750
你说什么? 你还想不想泡妞 老兄
What? You wanna nail  some tail or what, dog?


193
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.950
- 我时时刻刻都准备泡妞 宝贝  - 这才像样
- I'm always up for nailing tail!  - That's what I'm talking about.


194
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.870
这影片一但上网，会传疯的
Once this hits the Internet,  you'll be beating them off with a stick.


195
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.150
- 四星? 五星? 各钟类型?  - 至少是五星 六星的
- Fours? Fives? All kinds?  - I'm talking fives, sixes.


196
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.710
一定有五星 加油!
Fives, for sure. Come on!


197
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.391
- 好的  - 相信我，哥们!

好的 来吧
Yeah! All right! Hang on.


199
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.070
- 等等 里奇在干嘛?  - 你喝醉了吗?
- Richie! Record this, son.  - Are you drunk?


200
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.070
- Yeah.  
- Yeah.  
- I'm just getting started.  - 我要开始了

201
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.510
唐克 等一下!我们把这水池点燃
Hang on! Wait! We're gonna  light the pool on fire.


202
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:55.710
- 点燃它 里奇  - 对 点然它 快点
- Light that thing, Richie!  - Yeah! Light it up!


203
00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.150
火烧屁股
Light that puppy up.


204
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.350
- 哇!  - 我的天啊!
- Whoa!  - Oh, my God!


205
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.910
死亡之火水池!
The Flaming Pool of Death!


206
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.430
你准备好了吗?
You ready to go?


207
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.630
开始吧
Let's do this!


208
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.870

Oopsie daisy!


211
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.910
- 太棒了 哈哈哈  - 哈哈哈.
- That was awesome. Ha-ha-ha.  - Ha-ha-ha.


212
00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.670
- 哈哈哈.  - 真是太棒了，唐克
- Ha-ha-ha.  - That was awesome, Donk.


213
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.830
- 轻松搞定一百万点击率!  - 喔! 一百万?
- A million hits, easy!  - Oh! A million?


214
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.310
- 说不定更多!  - 没错老兄 我们就快成名啦
- Maybe more!  - Hell, yeah, dude! We're gonna be famous!


215
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.150
- 混蛋 我的游泳池!  - 唐克, 你妈来了 你妈来了
- Shit, my pool!  - Dude, your mom. Your mom.


216
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.830
你们在这里搞什么鬼?
What the hell are  you two idiots doing?


217
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.670
- 妈 我以为你去上班了  - 所以你们就胡作非为 是吗?
- I thought you were at work!  - That makes any difference?


218
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.910
快看!
Look!


219
00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.514
- 那是Titus追风车，我在电视上看过 快来!  - ByeBye，老妈
- That's the Titus! I've seen it on TV! Come on!  - Bye, Ma!


220
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.990
我给大家介绍一下这个终极追风车Titus
Let's take a tour of the ultimate  storm-chasing vehicle, the Titus.


221
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:03.630
它配备了24小时监测摄影镜头  不管从哪个角度都可纪录影像
She's equipped with 24 surveillance cameras,  so we have eyes from every angle.


222
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.230
特种防弹玻璃窗
Bulletproof Lexan windows.


223
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.710
360度减震摄影镜头
A gyroscopic stabilized camera.


224
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.517
5吨级绞盘
A five-ton winch.


225
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.830
4毫米脱氧钢装甲外壳
Four-millimeter solid steel armor.


226
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.550
后面这里，我们还配有一个迷你气象中心...
Now, back here, we have a mini  weather center, complete with...


227
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.916
一个风速计 湿度侦测器和电位计
an anemometer, humidity  sensor and potentiometer.


228
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:28.190
而它还有一个最特殊的地方 就是这个抓锚
But the thing that makes her really  special are these grappling claws.


229
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.190
啊
Ah.


230
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:33.990
它可以在风速每小时170英里的状况巍然耸立
They can stabilize us in winds  up to 170 miles an hour.


231
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.799
要是我们用到抓锚就是遇上末日飓风了
We're not going anywhere  with those suckers dug in.


232
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.680
闪开！
Clear!


233
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.441
这宝贝是我一生的心血
This is the culmination  of my life's work.


234
00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.550
那塔台呢 彼得?
What about the turret, Pete?


235
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.915
是的 塔台在这里
Right. The turret is up here.


236
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:11.591
塔台给我们360度室外的观测角度
Which gives us a 360-degree  view of outside.


237
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.390
还配备了一台数位摄影机  在我们找到这些龙卷风的时候...
It's fitted with a digital cinema camera that  will, when we find one of these bad boys...


238
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:18.510
能够让我们成为世纪英雄
give us the shot of the century.


239
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.761
这上帝之眼能帮我们见证一切
A sight nobody but God has witnessed:


240
00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.961
龙卷风之眼！
the eye of the tornado.


241
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.911
这是“切”的意思 雅各布，停止吧
That means "cut," Jacob. Cut it.


242
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.990
再拍点补充资料
Let's get some B roll.


243
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.670
拍一点抓锚 汽车背部的零件 控制面板
Get shots of the claws, the instruments  on the back, panel stuff.


244
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.990
- 拍点有用的东西给我，好吗?  - 好的 知道了
- Just give me stuff I can use. Okay?  - Got it.


245
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.399
这里的风暴不断膨胀扩大
My storm's expanding.


246
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.390
意味着到这里的时候会变得巨大无比
That means it's going to be really  big by the time it gets here.


247
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.714
嗨.
Hey.


248
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.753
我的宝贝好吗?
How's my bug?


249
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.310
听我说...
Well, listen, um...


250
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.310
妈妈说过这个星期赶回去...
I know I was gonna try and  make it home this weekend...


251
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.312
但是我们遇到一场很大的风暴  妈妈必须留下来工作
but we got a real big storm coming,  and Mama's gotta work.


252
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:12.314
不是 不是 我希望你告诉外公外婆...
No. No. I'm gonna need you to tell  Grandma and Grandpa that we're...


253
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.070
我知道
I know.


254
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.150
我知道 乖孩子 对不起
I know, sweet girl. I'm sorry.


255
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.230
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.


256
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.070
格蕾丝...
Gracie...


257
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.951
格蕾丝...
Grace...


258
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.992
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.


259
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.911
在拍我吗?
Did you get all that?


260
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.950
我们不能延期 盖瑞 那地方装不下所有的学生
We can't postpone this, Gary. There's  not enough room inside for everyone.


261
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.430
- 现在天气就挺不错的，不用那么担心  - 好吧 你来决定
- The weather's gonna be fine.  - It's your call.


262
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.510
那是爸爸正在被沃克校长训斥
There's Dad taking shit  from Principal Walker.


263
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.230
我会照办的
I Will do that.


264
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.350
最后部分弄好了吗?
Did you get the last  of the interviews?


265
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.550
没有 还差的远呢
I still got a few to do.


266
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:54.070
但是我拍到了贝尔老师的事业线，想看吗?
But what I did get was a nice shot  of Miss Bell's cleavage. Wanna see?


267
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.310
特雷
Trey.


268
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.390
怎么了?可没几个化学老师有事业线
What? You don't get many  teachers with a rack like that.


269
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.350
你别再闹了行吗，毕业典礼后得马上开始剪辑
Cut it out. We need to start  editing right after graduation.


270
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.830
爸爸希望下周末影片就可以上传
Dad wants the clips online  by the end of next week.


271
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.310
做一个影片时光胶囊到底有什么意义?
What's the point of doing  a video time capsule?


272
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.870
影片根本不会在网站上保留25年的
Video won't even exist in 25 years.


273
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.710
行了 赶紧把它做完行吗?
What? Let's just get  it finished. Okay?


274
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.270
好吧
Fine.


275
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.590
你看天气预报了吗?可能会有大风暴来袭
Did you see the weather report?  Supposed to be a big storm coming.


276
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.270
也许他们会取消整个...
Maybe they'll cancel the whole...


277
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.030
哇.你喜欢的女孩
Whoa. There's your girl.


278
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.430
如果我今天之前没有拿到资料，你就没法参加实习
If I don't get it by the end of the day,  you'll not get the internship.


279
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:24.830
就这么简单
It's as simple as that.


280
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.030
喔 可怜的女孩，老兄 你的机会来了
Oh, dude. Now's your  chance, man. Vulnerable girl.


281
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.190
去和她讲几句话安慰一下
Comforting guy. Right? Just go  talk to her and see if she's okay.


282
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.670
- 我们还有工作要做  - 胆小鬼，快去
- We have work to do.  - Chickenshit. Come on.


283
00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.510
我得把影片弄完，还有爸爸那部分够烦的了
I need to get the last of the interviews,  and Dad's, like, on my case about it.


284
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.670
别管老爸了，为了你自己去做点什么事吧
Screw Dad. Go do something  for yourself for once.


285
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:47.275
老哥，我拜托你就只是去跟他说说话
Bro, I am literally begging you.  Just go talk to her.


286
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.470
可以吗?
All right?


287
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.710
好吧
All right.


288
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.190
可以吗?
Yeah?


289
00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.950
- 够了  - 嘿
- Stop.  - Heh.


290
00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.830
玩得开心
Have fun.


291
00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.754
他真的这样做了  我要去拍下这场好戏
He's really doing it.  I gotta film this train wreck.


292
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.310
他马上要就定位了
And he's pulling into the station.


293
00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.560
嗨, 凯特琳?
Hey, Kaitlyn?


294
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.190
嗨
Hey.


295
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.710
我是唐尼
It's Donnie.


296
00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.350
我知道
Yeah. I know.


297
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.310
第一招成功
Strike one.


298
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.990
你还好吗? 我在外面看见你跟布兰斯基小姐
Are you okay? I saw you  outside with Miss Blasky.


299
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.638
还好，呃...
Right. Uh...


300
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:25.230
我申请了暑假实习班必须在这周末前交出
I had this application for an apprenticeship,  and it had to be submitted by the weekend.


301
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.830
但布兰斯基小姐检查后却告诉我这影片完全损坏了
And Miss Blasky checked it for me,  and it's just completely corrupted.


302
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.671
我不知道发生了什么事
I don't know what happened to it.


303
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.192
昨天还是好好的
It was fine yesterday.


304
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.390
好的 好的，是关于什么的影片?
Yeah. Yeah, that's toast.  What was it about?


305
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.190
加纳街上的废弃工厂
The abandoned factory on Garner.


306
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.030
- 天呐 那个造纸厂吗?  - 对啊
- Oh, the paper mill?  - Yeah.


307
00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.350
对
Yeah.


308
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.790
那个工厂关闭的时候州政府没有付钱做清扫
When they shut it down, the state  never paid for an official cleanup.


309
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.390
所以那些化学药剂和危险材料堆积的到处都是...
So there's all these chemicals and  hazardous materials sitting there...


310
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.110
甚至可能污染了城市的供水系统
contaminating the soil and probably  running off into the water.


311
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.070
- 这就是影片的主题  - 假装对这有兴趣
- That's what the film's about.  - Pretend to be interested.


312
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.870
申请书如果没有这部分 就没意义了
Anyway, the submission doesn't  make any sense at all without it.


313
00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.390
- 我算彻底完蛋了  - 加油 老哥 提供点意见
- So I'm screwed.  - Come on, man. Take a swing.


314
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.470
- 你这么关心环保的事情?  - 上啊 老哥 约她出去
- You're into all this environmental stuff, huh?  - Come on, man. Just ask her out.


315
00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.590
因为要保护地球 对吧?
Gotta take care of the planet, right?


316
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.510
要不然地球就会对我们反扑，对吧?
Or else the planet will take  care of us, right? Heh.


317
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:16.990
真是尴尬
That was awkward.


318
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.790
没错，反正我是真的关心 而且愿意尝试去做
Heh. Yeah. Well, some of us care,  or at least are trying to.


319
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.070
真不好意思
No. I'm sorry.


320
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.790
我可以帮你解决问题，我有很多摄影机和剪辑软件...
I can help. I have all these cameras  and this editing software and...


321
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.430
- 真的吗?  - 对
- Really?  - Yeah.


322
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.430
这不是什么难事 我们可以重新拍
Well, this will be easy.  We can reshoot this.


323
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.954
- 今天必须完成  - 今天?!
- It'd have to be today.  - Today?


324
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.790
哦，你在拍毕业影片  没关系 我自己可以的
Oh, you're filming the graduation.  No, it's fine.


325
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.910
没关系 我弟弟特雷，他也很擅长拍毕业影片
No. No. My brother, Trey,  he's good with all this stuff too.


326
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.510
- 可以让他帮我做  - 不行
- He can get that.  - No way.


327
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.630
- 他完全可以去搞定那个影片  - 真的吗?
- Like, he can get that footage.  - Really?


328
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.110
- 真的 真的 没问题  - 你确定?
- It's not a problem.  - Sure?


329
00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.077
- 当然了 确定  - 别想 当然有问题
- Yes, it's a problem.  - I'm sure. Yeah.


330
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.630
太感谢你了
Thank you so much.


331
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.590
不，你不知道这对我有多重要，我欠你一个大人情
No. You have no idea what this means  for me. I owe you so big for this.


332
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.350
别这样说，其实我和地球交情很深...
No. Well, you know, me and  the planet go way back, so...


333
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.950
谢谢你
Thank you.


334
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.950
- 我稍后就找你  - 没问题
- I'll see you later.  - Cool.


335
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.470
- 谢谢  - 不客气
- Thank you.  - Okay, no.


336
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.630
这小子真没勇气
This is so not cool.


337
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.119
你是在开玩笑吗?
You are kidding me.


338
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.240
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?


339
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.070
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?


340
00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.790
你真打算逃掉毕业典礼吗??
You're gonna skip the ceremony?


341
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.550
是啊 没错
Yeah. Yeah.


342
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.270
不是你说让我主动争取吗，我现在争取到了
You said do something for yourself,  so I'm doing something for myself.


343
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.270
真棒 所以你要丢下我一个人?
Yeah. And leaving me  to do all the filming?


344
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.918
你能搞定的 对吧?
You can handle it. Right?


345
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.870
你应该没问题吧?
You can handle it, right?


346
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.390
- 那倒是  - 好吧
- Yes.  - Heh.


347
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.630
当然了 勇往直前吧 老哥
Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Hey.  You go for it, bro.


348
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.470
记得顺便拍点不雅的影片寄Email给我
But get some skin on camera.  E-mail it to me.


349
00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:44.790
- 把我们的影片做完好吗?  - 好的  我这就去做
- Just get the interviews, all right?  - All right, all right, I'm going.


350
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:45.990
谢了
Okay.


351
00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.191
托德 开始拍了
Yo, Todd. We're rolling.


352
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.670
你好吗?未来你过的怎么样 哥们?
Yo, what's up, me?  How's life in the future, bro?


353
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:59.670
我刚听说你最近正在打NBA 而且超级有钱...
So I just know by now you are playing  for the NBA, you're super loaded...


354
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.590
你老婆还是个超级辣的啦啦队队长
and you got a super-smoking-hot  cheerleader wife.


355
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.990
那你现在干嘛看这玩意呢?
So why the hell are you  watching this right now?


356
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.990
为何还不去你的高级别墅和老婆好好享受人生，对吧?
Why don't you get up to your  penthouse and bang her good, right?


357
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.910
这就是你给自己的时光胶囊 托德?
That's your time-capsule  message, Todd?


358
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.150
有问题吗?
Why not?


359
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.990
时光胶囊!?
A message?


360
00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.870
我是用不上了 这些家伙也用不上了  给我的孩子和孙子 很简单
Too late for me. Too late for these guys.  But my kids? Grandkids? Simple.


361
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.510
好好读书 拿个高学历
Study. Get good grades.


362
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.590
要不然就会跟我们这些家伙一样天天当苦工，抱歉
Or else you're gonna hang around this group  of losers shoveling shit all day. Sorry.


363
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.870
嫁个有钱人...嫁个有钱人...
Please marry a rich guy.  Please marry a rich guy.


364
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.472
呃, 已经开始拍了
Uh, we're rolling.


365
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.194
你想跟25年后的自己说些什么?
So, what would you like to  say to yourself in 25 years?


366
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.710
刚刚已经说了
That was it.


367
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:43.350
25年之后?! 我想那个时候整个世界恐怕都被炸飞了
Twenty-five years' time? Ha! My guess is  we'd have blown up the world by that time.


368
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.550
好吧
All right.


369
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.830
面对现实 高中真的很烂
High school sucked.


370
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.190
希望一切都没白费，你成为布朗大学的博士
Hopefully, it was all worth it.  You've got your Ph.D. from Brown.


371

你正在做的研究可以帮助...
You're doing research and  using your skills to help...


372
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.670
别再妄想了! 哈!

373
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.310
抱歉了 老兄

376
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.910
摄影机测试良好
Camera's good.


377
00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:07.270
嘿，伙计们 你认为我们今天会看到龙卷风吗?
Hey, guys. So you think we'll get  to see a tornado today or what?


378
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:08.750
这可不好说
You never know.


379
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.957
雅各布，你有看到全部的相机电池吗?  我只看到四个
Jacob, did you bring all the  camera batteries? I only saw four.


380
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.590
我...呃... 出门时放在旅馆充电
I, uh, left them back  at the hotel on charge.


381
00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.790
今天不能没有电力，马上得回去拿
Today is not a good day to run out  of power. We gotta go get them.


382
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.470
开始行动吧  暴风一小时内就到了，它可不等人
Let's get moving. This system's  supposed to hit within the hour.


383
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.910
说不定更快
If that.


384
00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.832
拜托 老兄 照顾好自己 我都没面子了
Come on, dude, get your shit together,  man. You're making me look bad.


385
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.550

389
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.950
不管怎样，我可以操作摄影机
Anyway, I can run the cameras.


390
00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.510
全部三台?
All three?


391
00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.750
嗯，是的，爸爸。这就是为什么发明了三脚架。
Well, yes, Dad. That's why  they invented tripods.


392
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.556
特雷，这是很重要的事情。
Trey, this is important.


393
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.150
我不能胜任吗?
And I can't do it, right?


394
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.750
我没有这样说
I didn't say that.


395
00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.159
你就是这意思
You kind of did.


396
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.430
嗨，妈妈。怎么样格蕾丝？  她还在生气呢？
Hey, Mom. How's Gracie?  She still mad?


397
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.790
她才5岁  她没事的
She's 5 years old. She'll be fine.


398
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.076
我知道，但我已经离开三个月了  离开她太久了
I know, but I've been gone for months.  That's too long to be away from her.


399
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.710
我一直在想 是不是不该来这里
I keep thinking it was  a mistake coming here.


400
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.670
艾莉森，我们很好
MRS. McGEE: Allison, we're fine.


401
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.190
你的工作是很重要的
This is your job.  What you're doing is important.


402
00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.390
我脑袋里总是那几个死了的小孩
I can't stop thinking about  those kids that died.


403
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.830
什么小孩?
What kids?


404
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.990
没什么，亲爱的。奶奶和妈妈在随便聊聊，听着
Nothing, sweetie. Grandma and  Mama were just talking. But listen.


405
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.710
之前的事我很抱歉，我不想让你生气
I am sorry about our call earlier, okay?  I don't want you mad at me.


406
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.510
你什么时候回家

408
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.710
为什么不能现在回来?
Why can't you just come now?


409
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.630
我也希望如此  我真的很想念你
I wish I could.  I really do. I miss you.


410
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.470
艾莉森
Allison!


411
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.030
听着，我得走了，我每隔几个小时再联络，好吗?
Listen, I gotta go. But I'm gonna  check in every couple hours, okay?


412
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.110
答应我，你很快就会回家？
Promise me you'll be home soon?


413
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.350
我保证
I promise.


414
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.190
艾莉森

415
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.750
我得走了。我爱你，宝贝
I gotta go. I love you, bug.


416
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.510
我也爱你

417
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.710
我来了,老大!
I'm coming, boss!


418
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.510
现在我们已经证实，龙卷风袭击河岸.
We have now confirmed that a  tornado has hit Riverside.


419
00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.190
整个城镇处于严重的雷暴与警戒范围
All of Shaw County remains under  a severe thunderstorm warning.


420
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.910
查克,你在雷达上看见什么?
Chuck, what do you see on radar?


421
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.430
好的，史帝夫 我们现在看到它移动非常快速...
What we're watching  now is this very rapid...


422
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:08.030
- 数据，是吧？  - Shit！
- Data, huh?  - Shit.


423
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.951
也许我们到最后尾巴也没抓住
Maybe we'll catch the tail end of it.


424
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.235
- 西威尔顿发生了什么事?  - 给我一分钟
- What's going on in Silverton?  - Give me a minute.


425
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.710
呃, 龙卷风正在消散 有分散的雷暴雨现象
Um, it's dissipating. There's some scattered  thunderstorms and that's about it.


426
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.995
雷暴雨? 雷暴雨
Thunderstorms? Thunderstorms.


427
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.590
把所有的东西放到车上  我们要走了
Put everything in the van.  We're moving now.


428
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.070
我们要去哪?
Where do you wanna go?


429
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.030
嗯...没有你 只有我们  我们现在去河岸地区
You're not going anywhere.  We are going to Riverside.


430
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.030
-彼得 我觉得我们还是...  -我们会遇到下一个的
- How about...?  - We'll catch the next one.


431
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:40.191
听着 不会再有下一个了

Let's go.


433
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.710
这冰雹可真大

434
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.110
- 你刚才不是说在消散吗?  - 是在消散
- I thought you said it was dissipating.  - It was.


435

437
00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.630
哇, 等等

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.110
- 有什么情况?  - 风力重新聚集了
- What do we got?  - It's regenerating.


444
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.350
然后呢?
And?


445
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.950
西威尔顿
Silverton.


446
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.230
它来了
It's coming.


447
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.950
好极了
Great.


448
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:42.790

致今年毕业的所有同学们...
To all the students of this  year's graduating class...

你们现成可以自由选择自己人生道路
You are free to take your own path...


453
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.310
你们选择的道路不尽相同

454
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.630
但终将造就你们自己的精彩人生

命运掌握在你们自己手里
To create your own destiny.


456
00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.630
你快看这个地方
I mean, look at this place.


457
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.310
他们真应该好好整理 彻底消毒
They should tear it down.  Decontaminate it.


458
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.630
种些树或是建一座花园之类的
Plant some trees or a  garden or something.


459
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.670
他们应该在这造一个滑板公园
They should totally  build a skate park here.


460
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.830
哦不，花园  我觉得花园很好
No, a garden. Definitely a garden.

462
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.116
那你是不是想把三脚架放在那边?
So you wanna just put the  tripod down over there?


463
00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.550

472
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.434
我马上过去
I'm coming right up.


473
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.630
- 云墙往东移动了  - 哇
- Got wall cloud to the east.  - Whoa.


474
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.190
是啊，但是没有看到漩涡流
Yeah, but no vortex.


475
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.870
- 雅各布 在这边  - 这边出现气体循环了 看到了
- Jacob. I got some circulation over here.  - Over here, got it.


476
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.670
正向那些树移动过去
It's heading towards those trees.


477
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.350
我在橡木街
I'm on Oakwood Road.


478
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.390
如果你现在身处绍尔县，你需要给自己找一个安全的避难所
If you're in Shaw County, you need  to get yourself to a safe place now.


479
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.270
这场风暴将向右移动，几乎直达城镇中心
This thing is going to track right,  almost towards town.


480
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.550
它现在已经来了。你能看到巨大的云墙
There it is now. You can  see the wall cloud.


481
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.110
它慢慢移动到东部
It's lower as it  transitions to the east.


482
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.990
- 靠近南边。在基地的右后方  - 哇 快看看那个.
- Just south. Right behind the base.  - Wow. Look at that.


483
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.590

485
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.710
那些白痴在干嘛?

486
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.350
- 真是太漂亮了  - 哇!

488
00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.119
开到空地上! 开到空地上!
Get in the field! Get in the field!


489
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.710
看那个烟囱云
Look at that funnel.


490
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.201
我们看到漩涡了。来啊 开始了
We got a vortex. Come on.  Here we go, guys. Here we go.


491
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:01.070
有碎片
There's debris.


492
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.910
-雅各布 你拍到了吗  -当然

就在那边 在那边
There it is.


494
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.150
这个龙卷风刚刚着地
This tornado just touched down.  We can see it from here.


495
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.110
我们可以看到树被连根拔起  它所到之处所有的东西都被卷入了漩涡
It's ripping up trees.  It's ripping up everything in sight.


496
00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.510
要是你在地面必须赶快找一个避难所  找一个安全地点
If you're above ground, you need to get to  a storm shelter or a safe place right now.


497
00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:17.190
名作家约翰.厄普代克说:
I leave you with John Updike's words:


498
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.790
"若想掌握世界就必须学习更多
"You cannot help but learn more as  you take the world into your hands.


499
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.430
永怀虔诚的心...
Take it up reverently...


500
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:27.240
因世界就是古老的泥土 印满千万人民的指纹"
for it is an old piece of clay,  with millions of thumbprints on it."


501
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.110
好极了
Oh, great.


502
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.950

I guess we should, uh...


503

There's no damage yet,  but it's in a semi-residential area.


514
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.830

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:24.440
这真是太疯狂了
This is crazy, guys.


760
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.195
糟糕
Oh, shit.


761
00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:32.960
哇
Whoa.


762
00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:36.110
我能用你的手机吗?  我儿子很危险 我的手机没讯号
Hey, can I use your cell?  My son's out there. I got no signal.


763
00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.230
可以
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh...


764
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.150
我的也没讯号
I don't either.


765
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.350
他在哪?
Where is he?


766
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:44.830
他之前说在加纳街上的造纸厂
He said he was at an industrial  park on Garner Road.


767
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:46.190
是从这边往北吗?
Is that north of here?


768
00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.870
- 这太吓人了  - 我付钱就是让你拍这个的
- This is crazy.  - This is what we're paying you for.


769
00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:50.550
请等我一下
Give me one second.


770
00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:52.470
你们是怎么了?
Guys, what's going on?


771
00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:56.350
达里尔 真不可思议?  你的朋友居然不想干了
Daryl, can you believe this?  Your buddy here wants to quit.


772
00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:00.030
没说不想干了  给我们一点时间，彼得
Hey. No one's quitting here.  Just give us a minute, Pete.


773
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:02.155
给你一分钟
You got a minute.


774
00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.360
你会没事的 对吗?
You'll be okay. Right?


775
00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:10.470
这太疯狂了 老兄  你看 一辆卡车差点砸在我身上
This is crazy, man, all right?  I mean, a truck almost fell on us.


776
00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:11.710
冷静点 兄弟
Relax.


777
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:13.910
只要今天熬过去到了下周...
Make it through today,  and by next week...


778
00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:17.070
你口袋会装满了钱  到时你会躺在沙滩上喝着玛格丽塔酒...
you got cash and you are sitting  on a beach sipping margaritas...


779
00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:21.356
搂着你漂亮的女朋友 明白吗?
with that beautiful girlfriend  of yours. All right?


780
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.350
- 我不喜欢喝玛格丽塔酒  - 要相信我
- I don't even like margaritas.  - Heh. Trust me.


781
00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:27.990
走吧 别再浪费时间了  达里尔 把他那该死的摄影机拿过来
Come on, we're wasting time.  Daryl, just take his damn camera from him.


782
00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:29.190
他能搞定的
He's got this.


783
00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.710
- 我们为下个暴风准备吧  - 好的
- Let's get ready for the next system.  - All right.


784
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.070
下个暴风?
Another system?


785
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.390
等一下，那是往北走 对吗?
Wait a minute.  That was going north, right?


786
00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.590
那是造纸厂的方向
That's toward the paper mill.


787
00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.430
能带上我一起过去吗?  我的车已经坏了
I gotta get there. Can you  take us? My car is totaled.


788
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.750
- 抱歉 没时间  - 他的儿子在那边
- Sorry. No time.  - His son's out there.


789
00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.920
彼得
Pete.


790
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.630
到了那边别碍手碍脚的
Just stay out of the way.


791
00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:49.670
你们跟我坐厢型车过去吧
You guys can come in the van with me.


792
00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:52.710
- 拿摄影机的孩子跟我一起  - 可以吗? 太好了
- I can take the kid with the camera.  - Really? Sweet.


793
00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.199
不行 特雷 你必须跟着我
No, no, Trey, you're staying with me.


794
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.790
你瞧下，Titus才最安全
Look, the Titus is the  safest place for him.


795
00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:02.110
没错 那就是台坦克  我们随后就到
He's right. It's a tank.  We'll be right behind him.


796
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.190
- 到加纳街下车 知道吗?  - 知道
- Just as far as Garner, okay?  - Right.


797
00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.870
听着 孩子摄影机要一直开着  结束后 我三千元买你的影片
Keep that camera rolling. When this is  over, I'll give you 3 grand for your tape.


798
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:12.070
- 三千元?!  - 是的
- Three grand?  - Yeah.


799
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.070
- 没问题  - 一言为定
- Heh. You got it.  - Now we're talking.


800
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.001
我们出发吧
Let's move!


801
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.074
你的腿怎么样了?
How's your leg?


802
00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:25.274
好像好点了
It's a bit better.


803
00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:28.835
来
Here.


804
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.239
- 嗯  - 还好吗?
- Ah.  - All right?


805
00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:42.994
还好
Okay.


806
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:47.430
从哪学来的?
Where'd you learn that?


807
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.761
我妈曾经是个护士...
Uh, my mom was a nurse...


808
00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:55.510
在我们小时候  她不跟我们说故事却给我们上急救课
so when we were kids, instead of story  time, we'd have, like, CPR lessons.


809
00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:01.510
那时候我特别喜欢看“戴帽子的猫”  不过现在...
At the time I was kind of lobbying  for Cat in the Hat, but now...


810
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:04.761
好吧，谢谢你了，老妈
Ha, ha. Yeah, thanks, Mom.


811
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.232
- 可以吗?  - 挺好的
- Okay?  - Yeah.


812
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:10.999
谢谢
Thanks.


813
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.873
我骗我爸妈说 我是去图书馆
I told my parents I was  going to the library.


814
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.317
你爸爸会来救我们吧?
Your dad is coming, right?


815
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.710
会有人找到我们的
Someone will find us.


816
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.114
你还好吧?
You okay?


817
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.633
知道吗 我一辈子等的就是这样的暴风
Look, I waited my whole  life for a storm like this.


818
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.679
千万别让我失望了
Please don't let me down.


819
00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:02.314
你在联络谁?
Who you trying to reach?


820
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:04.670
我的女儿格蕾丝
My little girl, Gracie.


821
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:07.910
我从没离开过她那么长的时间
I've never been away from  her this long before.


822
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.830
她在哪?
Where is she?


823
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.717
跟我父母在一起 离这里有两百英里的地方
She's with my parents about  200 miles to the south.


824
00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.833
他们会保护她的
They'll make sure she's safe.


825
00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:22.756
是啊 只是这个时候离开她觉得心神不宁
Yeah. It just really feels wrong to be  away from her right now. You know?


826
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.070
格蕾丝多大了?
How old is Gracie?


827
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:26.717
快五岁了
She just turned 5.


828
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.270
哇
Wow.


829
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:32.070
- 正是最麻烦的年龄  - 她是个懂事的孩子
- They're a real handful at that age.  - She's a really good kid.


830
00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.110
你另一个儿子多大了?
How old is your other son?


831
00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:36.474
唐尼 17岁
Donnie? He's 17.


832
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:39.876
这个年纪的孩子不会有事的
He'll be all right. He knows  everything at that age.


833
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:44.199
自从他母亲去世之后  我总感觉和他有些距离
After his mom died,  I kind of lost him for a while.


834
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:47.114
我们会找到他的
We'll find him.


835
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.711
这就是你们的工作吗?  到处追着麻烦跑?
So is this what you guys do for a living?  Go around chasing trouble?


836
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.590
他们追 我搞研究
They chase. I study.


837
00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.874
让我成长许多 没错吧? 达里尔
Makes me the grown-up. Right, Daryl?


838
00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.870
还没听说过一次有这么多个
I've never heard of this  many tornadoes before.


839
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:05.270
这次真的很诡异  两个龙卷风在同一条路径上
It's a freak occurrence. Two storm  fronts taking the same path.


840
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.870
也没什么怪异的  卡特里娜还有乔普林都是这样
It's not freak anymore.  Not after Katrina. Not after Joplin.


841
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:12.630
一辈子只会看到一次超强暴风  现在居然变成一年一次了
What used to be once-in-a-lifetime seems  to be happening about once a year.


842
00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.630
想想桑迪龙卷风的后果吧
Look what happened  with Hurricane Sandy.


843
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.710
无论怎么样，我们都要搞清楚...
Whatever it is, we have  to figure it out...


844
00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:19.470
不然它们会袭击更多以前没出现过的地方
before they start shifting to  places they've never been before.


845
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:23.550
- 哪些地方?  - 或许是洛杉矶、芝加哥
- Like where?  - Like Los Angeles. Or Chicago.


846
00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:24.950
甚至伦敦
Even London.


847
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.430
有树挡住道路了
Tree blocking the road.


848
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:30.390
- 我们遇到麻烦了  - 能绕过去吗?
- We got a problem.  - Can you get around that?


849
00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:31.630
没办法
No.


850
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:33.350
爸爸 这是穆尔帕克公路吧?
Moorpark. Right, Dad?


851
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:36.270
往西差不多三英里  那里的路可能畅通无阻
It's about three miles west.  It might be clear that far out.


852
00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:37.470
好主意
Good call.


853
00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:40.232
调头往穆尔帕克公路
Doubling back to Moorpark.


854
00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:43.158
你儿子可真棒
That's a great boy you've got.


855
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:49.273
还记得你妈妈跟你说的最后一句话是什么?
Do you ever think about the last  thing you said to your mom?


856
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.192
每天都在想着
I think about it every day.


857
00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:58.120
呃...
Um...


858
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:01.390
当时我很生她的气
Because I was pissed at her.


859
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.630
我总能找到生气的理由
I was always pissed  at her for something.


860
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:08.473
比如说和爸爸离婚 离开我和特雷
For leaving Dad.  For leaving me and Trey.


861
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.798
周末的时候我们经常和她在一起  有次她送我们回来...
We used to spend the weekends  with her, so she was...


862
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:19.079
她想亲我跟我道别 我只是...
She was dropping us back, and she tried  to kiss me goodbye, and I just...


863
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.913
我几乎没看她一眼 她只好走了
I barely looked at her,  and she walked away.


864
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.961
差不多就这些 这就是最后一次
Yeah, that was it.  That was the last time.


865
00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.993
发生什么事?
What happened?


866
00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:37.158
发生车祸
It was a car accident.


867
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.230
- 真抱歉.  - 没关系的
- I'm sorry.  - No.


868
00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:43.275
只是...
It's...


869
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.310
听见了吗?
You hear that?


870
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:49.510
有人吗?
Hello?


871
00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:51.390
嘿! 嘿! 我们在下面
Hey! Hey, we're down here!


872
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.350
- 有人吗?  - 帮帮我们
- Hello?  - Please help us!


873
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:56.790
- 发生了什么事?  - 是管线破裂了吧
- What happened?  - I think a pipe burst!


874
00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:59.631
我的天啊
Oh, my God!


875
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:04.230
快点 唐克  你看见什么了?
Get on it, Donk.  You see anything yet?


876
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:08.070
- 我觉得那台Titus就在前面
- Titus?  - I think the twister cloud's up ahead.  - Twister cloud?


877
00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.830
该死 慢点 唐克!  我的屁股要裂了
Shit! Slow down, Donk!  You're busting my balls!


878
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:14.030
- 直接翻过这座山 会找到他们的  - 不 那不是座山
- Straight over this hill! You'll be fine!  - No! Not the hill!


879
00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.590
傻逼
Hey! Moron!


880
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.390
我的天啊 你个傻逼
Oh, my God!


881
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:22.390
你这白痴
Ugh! Damn! You dumb-ass!


882
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:24.710
你妹啊
- What the hell, man?  - Whoo! Yeah!


883
00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:28.030
- 没事吧，老兄?  - 当然
- You all right, man?  - Yes! Ha-ha-ha.


884
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.273
哇
Whoa.


885
00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:43.512
没事吧 老兄
Aw. This thing's awesome.


886
00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:46.490
- 这东西太酷了  - 相当狂野
- She's a beast.  - Absolutely.


887
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:49.231
哇, 这是太酷了.

你没事了吧?
You gonna be all right?


889
00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:58.670
其实我不该老对着你发火 知道吗
Look, I know I yell at  you a lot. But listen.


890
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:02.513
刚开始的时候我也经常吓得不轻
When I first started,  I was scared shitless too.


891
00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:06.190
现在我们寄予厚望的时刻终于来到了...
We got a lot riding on this.  But when the moment comes...


892
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:08.750
相信我 你一定会安然无恙的

You getting this on radar?


895
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.590
是 我看见了  朝着这方向快速过来了
I see it. It's headed  fast in this direction.


896
00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:18.070
我收到三个钩状小回波 也可能是四个
I got three small hook echoes.  Maybe four.


897
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:20.830
- 你现在能看到它的样子了吗  - 不行 看不到
- D, you getting any visual on this?  - No. Nothing.


898
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.070
我也什么都看没见
I'm not seeing anything, you guys.


899
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:24.830
上面看的情况怎么样 小子?
What's happening up top, kid?


900
00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:29.799
这也什么都没有 只看到云  等一下，在左边
I got nothing up here. Just clouds.  Wait, there it is. Right there on the left!


901
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:33.110
- 你们看见了吗?  - 看到了 正在拍呢
- Are you seeing this?  - Yeah, yeah, I got it.


902
00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.280
东北方向那边有动静
We got movement to the northeast.


903
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:38.350
快看看那边
Take a look at that!


904
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:41.751
伙伴们 它正在分裂
Guys, it's splitting.


905
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:46.913
- 会形成另一个漏斗云  - 我们后面也有情况
- We're gonna have another funnel.  - Something's happening behind us.


906
00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:48.830
那边也有一个
There's another one.


907

There are three. Four!  Shit, they're everywhere!


910
00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:00.950
我们四周有好几个龙卷风正在着陆
We have multiple  vortices touching down.


911
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:04.235
彼得 这些龙卷风不太稳定  我们得赶紧离开这边
These systems are too erratic.  We gotta get out of here.


912
00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:11.154
天啊 不~
No, no, no!


913
00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:18.550
- 看那东西  - 啊

We're gonna be YouTube stars  for the rest of our lives!


918

Ha, ha! Better than sex,  Donk! Ha-ha-ha.


919
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:48.472

920
00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:05.590
爸爸
Dad!


921
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.396
龙卷风在我们后面
Behind us!


922
00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:15.870
大家都没事吧?

940
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:33.715
我的天啊

956
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.840

957
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:44.276
糟糕
Oh, shit.


958
00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:57.070
特雷 特雷
Trey. Trey!


959
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:59.354
我在这里 爸爸
I'm here, Dad.


960
00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:04.035
- 我们得离开这里  - 是呀
- Let's get out of here.  - Yeah.


961
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.750
- 你们要去哪?  - 去找我儿子
- Where are you going?  - I'm getting my son.


962
00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:11.150
再等等 现在外面很危险
Please, wait. It isn't  safe out there.


963
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:13.559
要是你女儿有危险呢?
What if it was your daughter?


964
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:16.475
呃...
Um...


965
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:20.710
如果我们能驾驶箱型车会比走路安全  这你应该明白?
If we can get the van back on the road, we'll  be safer than we would be on foot. Okay?


966
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:23.153
彼得 你能不能...
Pete, can you hook up...?


967
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:29.280
你只在乎这些东西吗?
Is that all you care about?


968
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:32.470
不
No. No.


969
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.391
彼得，雅各布死了
Jacob's dead, Pete.


970
00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:38.880
如果不是因为你 他应该还活着
He'd probably still be alive  if it wasn't for you.


971
00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:41.999
你觉得雅各布的死是我的错?
You think what happened is my fault?


972
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:47.030
他之所以在外面不是他自己愿意的 对吧?
I mean, he wasn't out there  shooting for himself, was he?


973
00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:49.590
他是为了你 拍你的纪录片...
He was getting your  shot for your movie...


974
00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:53.230
因为你告诉他没有什么比龙卷风重要  而且你还不让他离开
because you told him nothing else  matters, and you wouldn't let him go.


975
00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:55.070
不
No.


976
00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.314
不能怪彼得
It wasn't Pete.


977
00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:00.670
该怪我
It was me.


978
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:03.190
我带他到这里的 是我的错
I brought him here. It was my fault.


979
00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:06.830
别这样 这些都不该发生的
No. No. None of this  should have happened.


980
00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:08.790
你一定要帮他找到儿子
You gotta help him find his son.


981
00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:11.358
我会的 那你呢?
I will. What about you?


982
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:14.353
我会待在这里
I'm gonna stay here.


983
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.234
看看能不能找到雅各布的父母  跟他们联系上
I'll see if I can find Jacob's parents.  Get in contact with them.


984
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:21.641
好吧
Okay.


985
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:23.710
- 帮忙堵住缝隙  - 什么?
- Help me close up the gap!  - Huh?


986
00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:26.438
帮忙把水堵住
Help me close it up!


987
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:32.798
- 这样能堵住水吗?  - 试试看
- Can you stop it coming in?  - I'm trying!


988
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:41.479
卢卡斯 你要来吗?
Lucas, you coming?


989
00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:42.790
彼得...
Pete...


990
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:46.872
你自己决定吧，反正我得继续
Suit yourself. I gotta finish this.


991
00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:48.670
特雷 快上车
Trey, come on. Get in.


992
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:51.352
- 我们去找你哥哥  - 好的
- Let's go find your brother.  - All right.


993
00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:00.670

加油
Come on.


995
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:06.230
真是个好孩子
That's my girl.


996
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:08.510
爸爸 外面天气越来越糟了
Dad, it's getting worse out there.


997
00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:16.993
还是没有讯号
Still no signal.


998
00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:26.910
我的手机 完全不能用了
My phone. It's not working.


999
00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:29.512
试试看你的手机
Try yours.


1000
00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:32.150
我的也没讯号
No, there's no signal.


1001
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:34.470
- 到那个洞口试试看  - 好的
- Try it through the gap right there.  - Okay.


1002
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:36.950
你的手臂刚好碰的到洞口
Your arm can fit.


1003
00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:40.510
- 我的天啊 有一格讯号  - 开扩音
- Oh, my God. There's a bar, there's a bar.  - Put it on speakerphone!

1014
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:12.550
你们还好吧?  我正带着些人前往避难所
Are you folks all right? I'm taking  these people to the shelter.


1015

- Maybe he made it to the school.  - What if he didn't? We gotta go.


1018
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:25.590
跟你们说 我刚从广播上听到  所有警报器都坏了
Listen. I heard on the radio,  all the warning sirens are down.


1019
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:28.477
如果真有龙卷风来 你们是不会知道的
If a tornado's coming,  you're not gonna know it.


1020
00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:31.755
可以了
Okay.


1021
00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:33.630
妈妈
Mom.


1022
00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:35.675
爸爸

1023
00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:41.640
我想对你们说声谢谢
I just wanna thank  you for everything.


1024
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:50.430
今天早上我下楼时是打算跟你们打招呼的...
I was gonna come down the stairs  this morning to say goodbye...


1025
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:52.790
但是我下楼的时候你们都出去了
but when I came you  were already gone.


1026
00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:54.150
我收到了一通留言
I got a message.


1027
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:56.790
爸爸 爸爸快来救我们
Dad! Dad! Please help us!


1028
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:59.830
我们这边的房子坍塌了，现在水不断地灌进来...
The building fell down on top of us,  and there's water pouring in...


1029
00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:03.590
- ...我不知道还有多少时间  - 我的天啊
- ...and I don't know how long we've got!  - Oh, my God.


1030
00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:06.431
我想告诉你们 我不孤单
You should know I'm not alone.


1031
00:58:09.210 --> 00:58:11.838
唐尼在这里
Donnie's here.


1032
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:16.479
他对我非常好
He's been really sweet.


1033
00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:26.078
所以还算不错
So it's kind of okay.


1034
00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.152
我非常爱你们
I love you so much.


1035
00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:41.754
你知道吗
Guess what.


1036
00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:46.476
我上周一直忙着时光胶囊的事  忙着拍别人的未来...
I spent the last week filming time  capsules about people's futures...


1037
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:49.917
却把自己的给忘了
and now it looks like  I don't have one.


1038
00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:53.710
所以...
So, uh...


1039
00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:56.392
如果没有未来了 那就...
if there's no future...


1040
00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:59.478
聊聊过去吧
we should talk about the past.


1041
00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:01.271
呃...
Um...


1042
00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:03.990
从小到大有不少的倒霉事
Some bad shit happened along the way.


1043
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:07.594
不过 每个人都倒霉过
You know, like it does  to everybody, I guess.


1044
00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:10.201
是我...
And...


1045
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:14.953
是我没有向前看 我还总是怪罪老爸
And I didn't move on, Dad.  I blamed you.


1046
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:20.639
老是找他麻烦 我非常后悔
I really gave you shit,  and I wish I hadn't.


1047
00:59:21.490 --> 00:59:25.437
真的 真的非常后悔
I so wish I hadn't.


1048
00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:31.990
现在后悔还来的及吗?
No point in wishing now, huh?


1049
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.433
我到底想说什么? 嗯...
What do I wanna say? Um...


1050
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:38.078
别怪特雷
Go easy on Trey.


1051
00:59:38.330 --> 00:59:41.030
他肯定会说这一切都是他的错
He's gonna tell you that  this is all his fault.


1052
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:44.110
这是他的主意 其实不是
This was his idea. But it wasn't.


1053
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:47.680
特雷就是这样 总是爱耍帅
It's just Trey.  His attention-seeking behavior.


1054
00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:50.839
是我的主意
My idea.


1055
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:53.874
我的错
My fault.


1056
00:59:55.370 --> 01:00:00.273
特雷 你就应该坚持做你自己  老弟 你真的很棒
Trey, you should be the person you always  were, dude, because you're awesome.


1057
01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:02.990
你是最棒的 我以你为荣...
You're awesome and  I'm proud of you...


1058
01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:05.990
珍惜每一天 把每天当成最后的日子
and just live every  day like it's your last.


1059
01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:08.831
因为世事难料
Because, shit, someday it will be.


1060
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:12.356
我第一次知道自己要说什么
And for once, I know  what I'm talking about.


1061
01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:17.960
爸爸...
And, Dad...


1062

I am not going to risk it.  I've got hundreds of people here.

You will have hundreds of  dead people if you stay.

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:47.270
它逐渐变成桶状的样子
It's becoming more  of a barrel-shaped.


1282
01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:51.590
楔形面略为下降了一点
The wedge has decreased a little bit, and it  looks like it's roping out at Air Depot Road.


1283
01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:53.230
看起来会在艾尔德普特路消失
Look at the rope on that thing.


1284
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:57.190
大家看看这东西变绳形  上面螺旋云看上去还是很接近地面
Feeder band looks like it's pretty low to  the ground. It's way lower than we are.


1285
01:19:57.290 --> 01:20:00.316
它彻底消失了
There it is. It's gone, Mike.


1286
01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:10.110
- 大家都没事吧?  - 我没事
- Everybody okay?  - I'm fine.


1287
01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:13.236
- 我们都没事  - 你没事
- Yeah, we're good.  - You're okay.


1288
01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:17.197
特雷?
Trey?


1289
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:50.150
这个龙卷风路径延伸至少长达十英里远
This was a storm that was on the ground  for at least 10 miles before it hit.


1290
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.550
...遭到巨型龙卷风袭击，破坏力极大
...assault by giant tornadoes.  And look how powerful they are.


1291
01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:56.870
其中一个龙卷风  已经被列为史上“最强龙卷风”
One tornado is already being called  the largest tornado in history.


1292
01:20:56.970 --> 01:20:59.070
这个超强暴风带来一场冰雹...
The intense storm that  set off the twisters...


1293
01:20:59.170 --> 01:21:01.070
大小介于高尔夫球跟棒球之间
dropped golf ball to  baseball-sized hail.


1294
01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:05.710
虽然无法避免  超强暴风造成许多伤亡
There's no denying the tragedy  that we've all endured here today.


1295
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:07.550
但是你们知道...
But you know...


1296
01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:11.791
我们的信念会带着我们度过难关  重建家园
our faith will carry us through,  and we will rebuild.


1297
01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:24.998
彼得的事我很难过
I'm sorry about Pete.


1298
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:31.950
嘿，小宝贝
Hey, little bug.


1299
01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:33.710
嗨
Hey.


1300
01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:35.990
没事，妈妈没事，放心
No, Mama's okay. I'm okay.


1301
01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:37.590
我答应你
I am. I promise.


1302
01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:39.750
马上就回家
I'm coming home.


1303
01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:42.270
是的，妈妈马上回家了
Yeah, Mama's coming home.


1304
01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:43.951
我也爱你
I love you too.


1305
01:21:52.410 --> 01:21:54.036
25年后?
In 25 years?


1306
01:21:55.930 --> 01:21:58.030
我觉得无所谓了
It doesn't matter, you know?


1307
01:21:58.130 --> 01:22:02.030
必须珍惜现在的日子
Just taking it one day at a time.


1308
01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:04.917
好好度过每一天
Every day's just fine.


1309
01:22:05.770 --> 01:22:07.670
因为我还活着
Because I'm alive.


1310
01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:09.310
活着就好
That's it.


1311
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:11.230
什么都无所谓了
Nothing else matters.


1312
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:16.110
有时候我觉得人类非常的疯狂
Sometimes I think the human  race as a species is crazy.


1313
01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:18.950
但是在危急的情况下...
But when the chips are down...


1314
01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:21.830
像我们这样当个普通人...
ordinary people, like you and me...


1315
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:23.390
才是最棒的
are good.


1316
01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:25.355
我很喜欢这样
I like that.


1317
01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:28.231
虽然我和彼得经常起争执...
You know, Pete and  I had our moments...


1318
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:32.190
但是我知道他每天活着的意义
but I know why he got  up every morning.


1319
01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:34.310
也知道他为什么牺牲了自己
And I know why he gave up his life.


1320
01:22:34.410 --> 01:22:37.110
他想做点有意义的事情 还有...
He wanted to make a difference and...


1321
01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:39.155
呃..
Um...


1322
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:43.230
希望这部影片可以完成他的遗愿
Well, hopefully this film  will help accomplish that.


1323
01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:45.070
对吗?
Huh?


1324
01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:52.230
呃，其实当时 真不知道能不能活下来
Uh, to be honest,  it didn't look good back there.


1325
01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:53.670
但是坚持过来了
But we made it.


1326
01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:56.670
因为我们一起相互扶持，而且我们还...
We stuck together, and here we are.


1327
01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:58.710
活着
Alive.


1328
01:22:58.810 --> 01:23:02.390
我会怀着感激的心情  在25年后 回忆这段经历
I'm just grateful that we'll be able  to look back on this in 25 years.


1329
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:06.350
25年后? 哇 那时候你变得非常老了吧
Twenty-five years? Wow.  You are gonna be so old.


1330
01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:07.830
- 嘿  - 说不定头发也掉光了
- Heh.  - And probably bald too.


1331
01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:09.230
行了吧，你这段要剪掉
All right, you're cut off.


1332
01:23:09.330 --> 01:23:12.276
唐尼，你有什么话想说?
Donnie, you have  something you wanna say?


1333
01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:18.030
呃，我不觉得一定要说什么
Uh, I don't think we really have  to say anything, you know?


1334
01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:21.156
我们都在一起
We're all here now. Together.


1335
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:23.190
才是最重要的
And that's all that matters.


1336
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:25.599
是的，没错
Yeah, it is.


1337
01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:28.630
好了，赶紧去工作吧
Okay. Let's get back to work.


1338
01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:35.950
嗨! 唐克!
Hey! Donk!


1339
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:38.110
唐克，你在哪
Donk, where are you?


1340
01:23:38.210 --> 01:23:40.474
在这里!
Over here!


1341
01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:42.550
嘿，你怎么倒着了?
Hey, you're upside down!


1342
01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:45.350
不，是你倒悬着  你还在一棵树上
No, you're upside down!  And you're in a tree!


1343
01:23:45.450 --> 01:23:47.270
恩，你也是啊
Well, so are you!


1344
01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:48.470
哦，是喔
Oh, yeah.


1345
01:23:48.570 --> 01:23:50.550
摄影机还能用吗?
That camera still working?


1346
01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:52.750
-可以  -哈哈
- Yeah, it is!  - Ha, ha.


1347
01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:56.030
-老兄，我们要发大财了  -呵呵，哈哈
- Man, we are gonna be so rich!  - Ha-ha-ha.


1348
01:23:56.130 --> 01:23:57.230
该死!唐克
Oh, shit! Donk!
