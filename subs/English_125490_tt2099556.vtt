I'd take you for a Hannah geist.

I'm here for Michael Felix.

he used to torment his lovers


18
00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:55.367
by packing his foreskin with spices
before intercourse?


19

I'll take this one.

21
00:03:14.387 --> 00:03:16.380
Breathtaking.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.852
I understand your fascination with her.

23
00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:26.182
I understand completely.

24
00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:30.273
She's perfect somehow, isn't she?

25
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:34.315
More than perfect.

26
00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.445
More than human.

27
00:03:40.204 --> 00:03:43.407
Her eyes seem to reach...

28
00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:49.208
right beneath your skin
and touch your organs.


29
00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.459
And touch your stomach.

30
00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:56.380
Your lungs.

31
00:03:58.097 --> 00:04:00.091
Gives me the shivers.

32
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:09.391
As you can see,
we have several options available.

Each was acquired
from miss geist directly.


34
00:04:15.114 --> 00:04:17.155
If I thought your interest
was only passing,


35
00:04:17.325 --> 00:04:19.578
there are any number
of low-end packages I could offer.


36
00:04:19.702 --> 00:04:22.159
However you strike me as a man

37
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.375
whose involvement
runs a little deeper than that.


38
00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:33.130
I see you... as a man of taste.

39
00:04:36.135 --> 00:04:38.592
A connoisseur.

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:51.811
If you'll permit me
to make a recommendation.


41
00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:56.149
S-558.

42
00:04:56.322 --> 00:05:01.400
Expensive...
But a must-have for the truly devoted.


43
00:05:02.453 --> 00:05:05.206
Miss geist was afflicted
during her much publicized affair


44
00:05:05.373 --> 00:05:07.662
with Laura law in 2003.

45
00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:10.586
We purchased it from her soon after.

46
00:05:11.962 --> 00:05:15.664
- S-558?
- Yes.


47
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.879
A form of the herpes simplex virus.

48
00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:23.846
After infection, the virus lives on
in the cells of its host


49
00:05:24.016 --> 00:05:26.010
for the rest of their life.

50
00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:33.225
Did you know she's deformed?

51
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.149
You can't tell from the magazines.

52
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:40.940
She has to have special underwear made.

53
00:05:41.117 --> 00:05:44.072
Fashion designers
make her special underwear.


54
00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.783
I've heard that.

55
00:05:54.088 --> 00:05:56.876
Do you have your credit card
with you, mr porris?


56
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.716
Which side do you want it on?

57
00:06:01.887 --> 00:06:03.881
I haven't decided.

58
00:06:05.308 --> 00:06:07.597
Most people want it on the left side.

59
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.807
If she kissed you,
it would be on the left side.


60
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.894
If she kissed me?

61
00:06:21.824 --> 00:06:26.867
Miss geist is infected here,
to the right of her mouth.


62
00:06:28.497 --> 00:06:31.914
Now, if she kissed you,

63
00:06:32.084 --> 00:06:34.623
it'd spread to your left side,

64
00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:36.789
around here.

65
00:06:39.717 --> 00:06:43.004
On the left, it'd be like
she gave it to you in person.


66
00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:45.587
Oh, yes, I'd like the left side.

67
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:55.975
Lean back, please.

68
00:07:00.696 --> 00:07:02.690

Mr Lucas, how do you respond to critics

you're really selling is a cultural one?

<i>They choose to come to me</i>

<i>and their lives are much richer for it.</i>

122
00:13:32.421 --> 00:13:37.049
The human face is a powerful messenger.

123
00:13:37.218 --> 00:13:41.051
Our brains are tuned
to its every nuance.


124
00:13:41.222 --> 00:13:43.346
The smallest shift in its musculature

125
00:13:43.516 --> 00:13:47.645
can translate itself
into complex nonverbal information,


126
00:13:47.812 --> 00:13:51.182
so subtle and communicated so quickly

127
00:13:51.357 --> 00:13:54.560
that we often don't even register it,
not consciously.


128
00:13:55.778 --> 00:13:57.819
One could say that for human beings,

129
00:13:57.989 --> 00:14:03.364
the face is a structure
with a high-information resolution.


130
00:14:03.536 --> 00:14:05.494
The ready face console is designed

131
00:14:05.663 --> 00:14:09.115
to engage the user's
unconscious mental resources


132
00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:14.500
by exploiting the brain's sensitivity
to facial patterns.


133
00:14:14.672 --> 00:14:17.627
Our technician
loads a virus sample into the port,


134
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:24.135
where it's analysed by readyface
and is translated into a face graphic.


135
00:14:24.307 --> 00:14:27.392
This image represents
the structure of the disease.


136
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:33.101
It is in a sense the face of the virus,
dense with information.


137
00:14:33.274 --> 00:14:36.145
As mr march manipulates the graphic,

138
00:14:36.319 --> 00:14:39.356
the machine manipulates the virus
in the sample container,


139
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.030
eventually rendering it noncontagious.

140
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.953
This advanced form of copy protection

141
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.407
affords us control
over the distribution of our products,


142
00:14:49.582 --> 00:14:53.118
as the virus cannot spread
beyond the infected client.


143
00:14:55.171 --> 00:14:56.915
Readyface fluidly incorporates

144
00:14:57.089 --> 00:15:00.542
our technician's
unconscious mental resources


145
00:15:00.718 --> 00:15:04.254
so that copy protecting
a sample like this one


146
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.302
will take hours rather than days.

No, she has to have special underwear
made because she doesn't have a vulva.

She was born without a vulva.

152

You're seriously buying into all this.

158
00:15:38.881 --> 00:15:41.338
What's to buy into?
What I'm saying is factual.


159
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:46.337
Factual? Yesterday her birth defect
was a unique, nonfunctional organ


160
00:15:46.514 --> 00:15:48.057
connected to her urinary system.

161
00:15:48.224 --> 00:15:50.264
It's worth millions
on the celebrity meat market.


162
00:15:50.434 --> 00:15:51.598
Yeah, also true.

163
00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:54.064
I'm sure the kid could shed some light
on the situation.


164
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.267
Didn't you take a genital wart sample
from Hannah geist once?


165
00:15:57.441 --> 00:16:01.061
- That was Derek.
- Did he mention if she had a vulva?


166
00:16:04.115 --> 00:16:06.654
We're doing lunch at dainty Davis.
You coming?


167
00:16:06.826 --> 00:16:08.819
[March] I already ate.

168
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.533
You look like shit.

169
00:16:19.422 --> 00:16:22.258
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hey, Syd. What can I get for you?


170
00:16:22.425 --> 00:16:25.343
183, 644 and 915.

171
00:16:25.511 --> 00:16:28.180
- 915?
- The new Aria noble flu.


172
00:16:28.347 --> 00:16:30.341
We got it this morning.

173
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.303
So we did.

174
00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:51.946
Thank you.

175
00:16:53.998 --> 00:16:55.992
Derek.

176
00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:07.803
[March] I understand
your fascination with her.


177
00:17:09.138 --> 00:17:11.547
I understand completely. She's...

178
00:17:11.724 --> 00:17:13.718
[Sighs]

179
00:17:13.893 --> 00:17:17.726
Perfect somehow, isn't she?

180
00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:20.891
More than perfect.

181
00:17:21.067 --> 00:17:23.606
An ideal.

182
00:17:23.778 --> 00:17:25.652
Overwhelming.

183
00:17:26.322 --> 00:17:30.949
With a whisper, she could have
anything she wanted.


184
00:17:32.787 --> 00:17:34.780
Anyone she wanted.

185
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:44.628
I'm happy to inform you that we have
something special available today.


186
00:17:46.676 --> 00:17:48.669
It just came in this morning.

187
00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:53.299
S-915.

188
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.594
You would be the first.

189
00:17:57.436 --> 00:18:02.146
A biological communion
between you and Aria.


190
00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:04.939
From her body to your body.

191
00:18:05.903 --> 00:18:08.941
From her cells to your cells.

192
00:18:10.116 --> 00:18:12.109
In my humble opinion...

193
00:18:14.286 --> 00:18:16.280
it's not even a question.

194
00:18:25.756 --> 00:18:27.750
Just a little pinch.

195
00:18:37.226 --> 00:18:40.561
The fever should come on
just in time for the long weekend.


196
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:52.274
Enjoy.

197
00:19:32.073 --> 00:19:34.113
Are you carrying
any infectious material with you


198
00:19:34.283 --> 00:19:38.329
or items belonging to the Lucas clinic
incorporated or its suppliers?


199
00:19:38.496 --> 00:19:40.952
No.

200
00:20:15.074 --> 00:20:17.613
Next. Who's ne... ok.

201
00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:20.111
Geist, ok, yeah.

202
00:20:22.415 --> 00:20:25.785
Ok, what are we... like we're talking
like a roast for two people?


203
00:20:27.003 --> 00:20:28.035
This is good.

204
00:20:33.592 --> 00:20:35.586
Hello, sir. What can I get you?

205
00:20:44.937 --> 00:20:46.931
I've been trying to reach you.

206
00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:50.935
I was sick.

207
00:20:55.323 --> 00:20:58.858
I think my body's
starting to turn on me, arvid.


208
00:20:59.035 --> 00:21:01.277
I don't know how much longer
I can do this.


209
00:21:01.454 --> 00:21:02.735
You'll be fine.

210
00:21:02.913 --> 00:21:05.951
There's an ebb and flow
to this kind of work.


211
00:21:07.418 --> 00:21:11.417
Give it a month and you'll feel like
a completely different person.


212
00:21:11.589 --> 00:21:15.422
I already feel like a different person.
I'm developing a cripple identity.


213
00:21:17.094 --> 00:21:20.096
- [Arvid] I think you look great.
- Thanks.


214
00:21:22.642 --> 00:21:25.560
I don't understand
how this isn't considered cannibalism.


215
00:21:25.728 --> 00:21:27.852
Well, these are just muscle cells.

216
00:21:28.022 --> 00:21:31.771
It all depends on whether the human
being is found in its materials.


217
00:21:31.942 --> 00:21:37.020
Right now the law tends towards
something more religious,


218
00:21:37.198 --> 00:21:41.327
but we'll see what happens when we go
from growing celebrity cell steaks


219
00:21:41.494 --> 00:21:44.496
to growing complete celebrity bodies.

220
00:21:45.748 --> 00:21:47.492
I'm looking forward to it.

221
00:21:47.667 --> 00:21:51.665
And with the proper funding,
I could probably make that happen.


222
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.047
- Have you seen my cell garden?
- No.


223
00:22:05.393 --> 00:22:07.849
[Arvid] Something new
I've been cooking up.


224
00:22:15.361 --> 00:22:17.355
So do we have business?

225
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.484
Yeah.

226
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.284
Yeah. I, uh...

227
00:22:26.122 --> 00:22:28.448
I cracked the new Aria noble flu.

228
00:22:28.624 --> 00:22:31.911
- It's already public.
- What?


229
00:22:32.086 --> 00:22:35.954
Since Saturday. 
You're behind the times.

230
00:22:36.132 --> 00:22:39.383
- The clinic just got it last week.
- Well, somebody beat you to the punch.


231
00:22:39.552 --> 00:22:42.423
- Who?
- One of my other guys.


232
00:22:42.596 --> 00:22:44.175
Arvid.

233
00:22:44.348 --> 00:22:47.765
Look, I'm not
some bug-collecting hobbyist.


234
00:22:47.935 --> 00:22:50.225
You wanna get paid for your work,

235
00:22:50.396 --> 00:22:52.853
talk to me
when you stop getting scooped.


236
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.244
[Low voices]

237
00:23:25.348 --> 00:23:27.756
What's going on?

238
00:23:27.933 --> 00:23:29.559
They arrested Derek.

239
00:23:29.727 --> 00:23:33.642
Villainy in our own house, Syd. I simply
cannot work under these conditions.


240
00:23:33.814 --> 00:23:35.773
Like anyone would take you.

241
00:23:35.941 --> 00:23:38.065
I hear vole & tesser are hiring.

242
00:23:38.235 --> 00:23:41.073
Topp didn't even know about Sara
holden's skin flap until I told him.


243
00:23:41.155 --> 00:23:44.276
I'm sure the kid doesn't know about
Sara holden's skin flap right now.


244
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.024
You're too good for skin flaps,
aren't you, Syd?


245
00:23:47.203 --> 00:23:49.410
Skin flaps are beneath you.

246
00:23:52.124 --> 00:23:56.253
Is there anything else you need? No?

247
00:23:58.422 --> 00:24:02.919
[Lucas] Did you know that healthy tulips
have solid-coloured petals?


248
00:24:03.094 --> 00:24:08.053
The stripes on this flower
are caused by a viral infection.


249
00:24:08.224 --> 00:24:10.893
[March] I had heard that, yes.

250
00:24:13.771 --> 00:24:15.895
Mm.

251
00:24:16.065 --> 00:24:18.059
Ok.

252
00:24:21.904 --> 00:24:23.898
It's a weird business, Syd.

253
00:24:26.993 --> 00:24:28.571
Do you know Derek Lessing?

254
00:24:30.162 --> 00:24:32.156
Not well.

255
00:24:33.541 --> 00:24:37.586
Well, the police found
an unlicensed readyface console


256
00:24:37.753 --> 00:24:40.162
in his apartment today.

257
00:24:40.339 --> 00:24:43.211
An older model, a 35-50.

258
00:24:43.384 --> 00:24:49.008
They think he was undoing the copy
protection on some of our samples


259
00:24:49.181 --> 00:24:53.429
and then selling the contagious viruses
to a piracy group.


260
00:24:53.602 --> 00:24:57.815
- Jesus.
- That machine is registered to us.


261
00:24:58.816 --> 00:25:02.233
I guess he must have smuggled it
out of the store room or something.


262
00:25:02.403 --> 00:25:04.195
So I had Michelle run an inventory

263
00:25:04.363 --> 00:25:08.694
and she discovered that there was
a second machine that's gone missing.


264
00:25:09.952 --> 00:25:13.618
Will you let me know
if you hear anything at all?


265
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:15.249
Of course.

266
00:25:17.626 --> 00:25:20.083
I'm gonna send you
on a house call today.


267
00:25:20.254 --> 00:25:22.331
You're going to see Hannah geist.

268
00:25:22.506 --> 00:25:25.710
She's sick, she's at the mayerson
and she's eager to sell.


269
00:25:25.885 --> 00:25:29.670
Now, normally
I'd be sending Derek on this,


270
00:25:29.847 --> 00:25:33.347
so be tactful if the subject comes up.

271
00:25:34.435 --> 00:25:36.429
Yes, sir.

273
00:25:51.786 --> 00:25:54.823
Wait inside.
They'll call you when they're ready.


274
00:26:21.899 --> 00:26:24.189
I didn't know vole & tesser was here.

275
00:26:28.155 --> 00:26:32.902
You do know the Hannah geist line
is exclusive to Lucas?


276
00:26:33.077 --> 00:26:36.696
Sure. She's all you have going for you.

277
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.752
I hear she's worth more
than your entire catalogue.


278
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.123
I've never really cared for her.

279
00:26:48.009 --> 00:26:50.002
Why are you here?

280
00:26:50.177 --> 00:26:52.669
Gregory vern.

281
00:26:52.847 --> 00:26:55.054
Terminal illness?

282
00:26:55.224 --> 00:26:58.511
It's for mr vole's personal collection.

283
00:26:58.686 --> 00:27:00.680
He has a license.

Where's Derek?

00:27:21.959 --> 00:27:24.961
He called in sick. 
My name is Syd march.

Shh.

288

Tell Dorian we'll be in touch.

289
00:31:37.048 --> 00:31:41.046
[March] She's perfect somehow,
isn't she?


290
00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:45.673
More than perfect.

291
00:31:48.476 --> 00:31:50.469
More than human.

00:31:53.648 --> 00:31:56.104

293
00:31:58.152 --> 00:31:59.813

294
00:32:03.699 --> 00:32:07.235
Sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

295
00:32:13.334 --> 00:32:16.170
Whoa, hey.
Whoa. What is wrong with you?


296
00:32:16.337 --> 00:32:18.829
I need to go.

297
00:32:19.006 --> 00:32:21.249
Can you finish? Please?

- I was... asleep.
- Yeah, that's what I figured.


316
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:45.135
I know you've been sick.

317
00:38:46.519 --> 00:38:49.188
Wow, I'll tell you,
it's pretty shocking.


318
00:38:49.355 --> 00:38:53.982
And now they're saying it's a virus
that she picked up in China.


319
00:38:54.151 --> 00:38:57.153
But her family
will not let them autopsy the body


320
00:38:57.321 --> 00:39:00.691
until they fly over a specialist
from Munich.


321
00:39:01.993 --> 00:39:03.867
Autopsy?

322
00:39:04.036 --> 00:39:07.406
Well, they want their own doctor.
They're German.


323
00:39:15.047 --> 00:39:17.337
Hey!

324
00:39:17.508 --> 00:39:19.677
- You get in line.
- [Man] Everyone listen carefully!


325
00:39:19.802 --> 00:39:22.638
We're cutting our last tray
of Hannah geist for the day.


326
00:39:22.805 --> 00:39:25.058
If you get a ticket,
you can buy one three-ounce steak.


327
00:39:25.224 --> 00:39:27.763
If you don't get a ticket,
you have to come back tomorrow.


328
00:39:27.935 --> 00:39:30.344
- Is arvid around?
- Yeah, he's in the back.


329
00:39:36.235 --> 00:39:40.104
[Arvid] Are you aware
they're still growing the cancer cells


330
00:39:40.281 --> 00:39:43.318
of a woman who died in the 1950s,
henrietta lacks?


331
00:39:43.492 --> 00:39:47.159
Yeah, they use them for research.

332
00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:52.206
So these cells of hers are alive

333
00:39:52.376 --> 00:39:55.248
and multiplying all over the world.

334
00:39:56.922 --> 00:40:00.209
The afterlife is getting
extremely perverse.


335
00:40:00.384 --> 00:40:03.007
What happened to Hannah geist?

336
00:40:03.179 --> 00:40:05.468
You don't know?

337
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.345
I think I was asleep.

338
00:40:08.517 --> 00:40:14.023
She was sick for about a week.
Nothing serious.


339
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.896
Then this morning
one of her aides found her dead.


340
00:40:18.861 --> 00:40:22.942
She was in China looking at orphans,

341
00:40:23.115 --> 00:40:25.987
but none of her entourage
are having any problems,


342
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.028
so they don't know what it is she had
or how it was communicated.


343
00:40:30.206 --> 00:40:33.955
It's quite an ordeal for the family.

344
00:40:34.126 --> 00:40:38.920
This all must feel
a bit personal to you.


345
00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:40.170
How so?

346
00:40:40.341 --> 00:40:44.636
Well, you were one of the last people
to see her alive.


347
00:40:46.222 --> 00:40:49.224
- Where'd you hear that?
- I have big ears.


348
00:40:52.603 --> 00:40:55.226
I was hoping
that's why you came to see me.


349
00:40:56.482 --> 00:40:58.476
Sorry to disappoint.

350
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.188
That's too bad,

351
00:41:01.362 --> 00:41:05.776
because that virus would be
the holy grail while this heat lasts.


352
00:41:07.284 --> 00:41:10.452
Is there any chance
you can get me a taste?


353
00:41:10.621 --> 00:41:15.331
I wish. We can't hold deadly pathogens.

354
00:41:15.501 --> 00:41:17.660
I'm sure the health board
already took everything.


355
00:41:17.837 --> 00:41:22.630
Yeah? What about you? 
You look sick.

356
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.924
I am sick.

357
00:41:26.429 --> 00:41:31.056
Listen, my console's down.
You know anybody with parts to spare?


358
00:41:31.225 --> 00:41:33.515
Maybe.

359
00:41:33.686 --> 00:41:39.393
The antipiracy lobby is fairly insane
right now, so everyone's paranoid.


360
00:41:41.152 --> 00:41:43.904
- I need a new 80-box.
- I'll see what I can do.


361
00:41:45.114 --> 00:41:47.191
Hey. Hey, hey.

362
00:41:47.366 --> 00:41:49.574
Is it true they arrested Derek Lessing?

363
00:41:49.744 --> 00:41:51.951
Yeah.

364
00:41:52.121 --> 00:41:55.657
That's too bad.
He did some really good work for me.


365
00:41:56.542 --> 00:42:00.126
Here, have some Hannah.
On the house.


366
00:42:28.366 --> 00:42:31.118
<i>[Lucas] There is less light</i>
<i>in the world now.</i>


367
00:42:31.285 --> 00:42:33.777
<i>That much is certain.</i>

368
00:42:33.954 --> 00:42:37.206
<i>A ray of light has been lost.</i>

369
00:42:38.459 --> 00:42:41.165
<i>Hannah was a friend of this clinic,</i>

370
00:42:41.337 --> 00:42:44.873
<i>and I'm proud to say</i>
<i>I knew her personally.</i>


371
00:42:45.049 --> 00:42:50.045
<i>She was truly a
sweet and a humble soul.</i>

372
00:42:50.221 --> 00:42:54.469
<i>Our prayers here at Lucas</i>
<i>are with her family and loved ones.</i>


373
00:42:57.812 --> 00:43:00.767
- So what's your professional opinion?
- What?


374
00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.692
Well, you must have had
a good look at her.


375
00:43:02.817 --> 00:43:06.103
We've got a pre-autopsy pool
going with the guys in accounting.


376
00:43:06.278 --> 00:43:09.364
Mercer's playing it safe
and going with flu virus.


377
00:43:09.532 --> 00:43:12.617
I'm thinking of taking a flyer
and going with food poisoning.


378
00:43:12.785 --> 00:43:15.359
Do you think
it might have been food poisoning?


379
00:43:15.538 --> 00:43:17.697
I don't know.

380
00:43:17.873 --> 00:43:21.125
Of course, no one's saying drugs.
They'll never admit it if it is drugs.


381
00:43:21.293 --> 00:43:24.331
- She didn't do drugs.
- Oh, you knew her well?


382
00:43:24.505 --> 00:43:25.834
She was a Buddhist from birth.

383
00:43:26.007 --> 00:43:28.676
She couldn't even take painkillers
or she would have been beaten.


384
00:43:28.843 --> 00:43:33.055
I hear we'll be selling ringworm
from her dog brom to fans with dogs.


385
00:43:33.222 --> 00:43:35.714
Brom's getting a following.

386
00:43:35.891 --> 00:43:39.593
Hey, Dorian turned your sample over
to the board this morning.


387
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:44.813
That's a bit exciting, our little shop
on the fringes of a media frenzy.


388
00:43:47.653 --> 00:43:50.406
Can I have a 900 pack?

389
00:43:50.573 --> 00:43:52.531
What's a 900 pack?

390
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.859
Hannah geist variety pack.

391
00:43:55.036 --> 00:43:57.409
Everybody's guzzling geist today.

392
00:43:59.081 --> 00:44:00.790
<i>[Woman] Everyone's talking about her...</i>

393
00:44:00.958 --> 00:44:02.878
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>
<i>I don't even know if I can say it.</i>


394
00:44:02.918 --> 00:44:04.877
<i>Her anus. You heard that right.</i>

395
00:44:05.046 --> 00:44:09.210
<i>Rumours of the young star's situation</i>

<i>[Man] Well, that settles it.</i>
<i>I'm getting a camera.</i>

<i>- The hunt is on.</i>

412
00:44:58.391 --> 00:45:00.100
[March groans]

413
00:45:07.149 --> 00:45:11.480
- What's with the cane?
- I've been having a little trouble.


414
00:45:11.654 --> 00:45:14.490
I've gotta make a quick stop
before we get your part.


415
00:45:33.092 --> 00:45:36.544
[Man] It must have happened overnight.
We found them like this in the morning.


416
00:45:36.721 --> 00:45:38.798
[Arvid] I've never seen anything
like this before.


417
00:45:38.973 --> 00:45:40.766
I mean, they were fine
when we shipped them.


418
00:45:40.933 --> 00:45:45.726
Obviously they weren't fine.
You sold me bad meat.


419
00:45:45.896 --> 00:45:47.855
Well, are your trays clean?

420
00:45:48.024 --> 00:45:50.812
Don't fuck with me, arvid.
Don't you even fuck with me.


421
00:45:50.985 --> 00:45:54.485
- [Arvid] Ok. I'm sorry, Luc.
- [Luc] I can't serve this.


422
00:45:54.655 --> 00:45:57.776
They think they're getting Hannah geist
and I'm feeding them Ron deggy.


423
00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:02.328
[Arvid] Ok. I'm gonna find out
what happened and I'm gonna fix it.


424
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.448
So do I get
to know what's killing you?

425
00:46:08.377 --> 00:46:11.296
An antique Michael Felix bug
I sold the other day.


426
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:15.044
It was a mistake.

427
00:46:15.217 --> 00:46:18.472
Apparently the copy protection on some
of those old samples got a little weird,


428
00:46:18.554 --> 00:46:21.223
but I didn't think
I'd get another chance.


429
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.431
Sounds reckless.

430
00:46:23.601 --> 00:46:26.638
I'm just trying to keep things
interesting for myself.


431

- For two?
- Is levine around?


432

Sure, he's in the back.
I'll let him know you're coming.


433
00:47:25.997 --> 00:47:28.749
You'll like levine.
He's one of my best guys.

I just wanna make sure
he's comfortable with all this.

<i>Do you want me to hurt myself?</i>

<i>- I can't take it any more!</i>

It's always strange
to meet the competition.


464
00:50:58.459 --> 00:51:02.873
So arvid here tells me that
you actually work at the Lucas clinic.


465
00:51:03.047 --> 00:51:04.626
Yeah.

466
00:51:06.801 --> 00:51:10.087
I think one of your friends
is a customer of mine.

Really? Yeah,

468
00:51:12.932 --> 00:51:16.598
So that's kind of cool, huh?
You're like an inside man.


469
00:51:16.769 --> 00:51:19.095
I think I'd be too contemptuous
to play that game.


470
00:51:19.271 --> 00:51:22.642
Oh, yeah. Levine's too classy
to profit from such trash.

[Levine] I'm talking about politics.

I get that we're all rat men here,
arvid, scavenging the bin.


473
00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:32.991
But I like to think that my work
is purposefully gross at least.

a little dignity somewhere.

No of fence. I don't even think
dignity's still valid currency.

00:51:41.794 --> 00:51:43.871
I appreciate you
helping me out like this.

Where'd you get this?

480
00:51:56.976 --> 00:52:00.725
I built it using old parts I co-opted
from a contact at vole & tesser.


481
00:52:00.896 --> 00:52:02.974
I've been modifying it for years.

482
00:52:03.149 --> 00:52:06.566
The resolution is somewhere between
one of the new readyfaces and a 7-86.


483
00:52:06.736 --> 00:52:10.984
You, uh... wanna run your blood
through it right here?

No, thank you.

Yeah, that's fine.

486

So I don't have your 80-box,
but I can get one within the week.


487
00:52:26.672 --> 00:52:28.962
- Arvid said you had one.
- I thought I did.


488
00:52:29.133 --> 00:52:32.218
Turns out none of my stuff
is compatible.

Hey, I'm completely trustworthy,
all right?


491
00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:39.842
I already know the guy
who can dig one up for me.


492
00:52:40.019 --> 00:52:41.354
As a sign of good faith, though,

The sample. What the hell, arvid?

I hope you're not taking this
too personally.


506
00:54:03.853 --> 00:54:07.686
Well, I'll admit I was a little insulted

507
00:54:07.857 --> 00:54:10.265
when I found out
you weren't gonna share with me.


508
00:54:10.443 --> 00:54:13.017
Were you gonna shop it around?

Did you just want this one
all to yourself?

Ok.

Listen, I understand
these are special circumstances.


512
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:28.458
You and I both recognise that.

513
00:54:29.337 --> 00:54:30.666
When we're done here,

514
00:54:30.838 --> 00:54:36.046
I'll find you a doctor who will keep
your situation low profile.


515
00:54:37.261 --> 00:54:43.217
And then we'll get you fixed up...
And you can still work for me.

- Almost.


519
00:54:59.033 --> 00:55:02.569
I wouldn't mind grabbing
a bit of that rash for good measure.

Hm.

526
00:56:36.088 --> 00:56:40.217
Did you hear she died in her sleep while
her boyfriend was in the other room?


527
00:56:40.384 --> 00:56:41.630
Then he got into bed

528
00:56:41.802 --> 00:56:45.053
and slept beside her body
the whole night without knowing.


529
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:50.850
Can you imagine what an ordeal
it must have been when he found out?

I've been touching my wife
before I go to sleep


533

just to make sure she's still warm.

Yes.

You know, towards the end
of my grandmother's life,


559
01:00:20.396 --> 01:00:26.103
she imagined the entire world was
operating exclusively with her in mind.


560
01:00:26.277 --> 01:00:31.106
I was only a child at the time,
but I remember once I got off the toilet


561
01:00:31.282 --> 01:00:35.696
and she asked me what I had intended
to communicate to her.

01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:39.655
It was later discovered
she had a brain tumour.

I think that virus destroyed my console.

The virus was designed with
a security measure to prevent analysis.

but I was eventually able to bypass it.

- Yes.

We have reason to believe that her
infection was an assassination attempt,

to prevent a second attack.

that with each of these patches,

618
01:06:04.824 --> 01:06:08.443
my world has become more charged,

619
01:06:10.204 --> 01:06:13.040
that there is a power,

620
01:06:13.207 --> 01:06:17.206
something in the thrall
of the collective eye


621
01:06:17.378 --> 01:06:20.795
that can be consumed and appropriated.

622
01:06:23.884 --> 01:06:26.970
You play the sceptic,
but I don't believe it.


623
01:06:27.138 --> 01:06:31.088
Surely you could have stolen Hannah's
blood without injecting yourself.


624
01:06:31.267 --> 01:06:33.260
Why did you do it?

625
01:06:35.313 --> 01:06:37.639
Maybe you feel what I feel.

626
01:06:39.233 --> 01:06:42.650
Or maybe you're really just another fan.

627
01:06:44.905 --> 01:06:49.652
Well, now you share a death with her,

628
01:06:49.827 --> 01:06:52.200
and that's a powerful bond.

629
01:06:53.873 --> 01:06:55.866
I don't wanna die from this.

630
01:06:58.336 --> 01:07:00.329
Of course.

631
01:07:03.257 --> 01:07:05.334
Uh, here.

632
01:07:06.469 --> 01:07:08.546
Two, three times daily.

633
01:07:08.721 --> 01:07:10.430
What are they?

634
01:07:10.598 --> 01:07:12.971
Antivirals.

635
01:07:13.142 --> 01:07:15.551
They should help
slow the infection down.


636
01:10:07.525 --> 01:10:11.820
You're an absolute disgrace.
Where you been, bud?


637
01:10:11.988 --> 01:10:15.191
- I was sick.
- Dorian's in a rage.

these days.

Thank you.

641
01:10:22.123 --> 01:10:26.287
I need someone nonresponsive to talk to
and you're cheaper than my therapist.


642
01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:30.162
I gotta say, it doesn't look like
your little vacation did you much good.


643

- Hi, Michelle.
- Hey, Mercer.


644
01:10:33.175 --> 01:10:37.340
Ask me if I'm looking forward to Timothy
Stanton's molluscum this afternoon.


645
01:10:37.513 --> 01:10:40.349
- [Mercer] Timothy Stanton is impotent.
- It's on his shoulder.


646

You can get molluscum anywhere.

He has an infection to sell every time
he gets a divorce. It's uncanny.

He's holding a competition
through <i>spot magazine.</i>


649
01:10:48.399 --> 01:10:50.443
The winner gets to infect him
with their next cold


650
01:10:50.568 --> 01:10:53.024
and they get a free sample
after he gets sick.


651
01:10:54.822 --> 01:10:58.488

- No, I don't get colds.

655
01:11:30.733 --> 01:11:32.943
I was wondering

Yeah, sure thing.

657

What is the recent sales history
for Hannah geist sample s-888?


658
01:11:43.245 --> 01:11:45.784
- How recent?
- Last two months.


659
01:11:45.956 --> 01:11:48.958
Uh, s-888 is the Bermuda flu

660
01:11:49.126 --> 01:11:51.416
which we phased out
when we got Paris honeymoon, so...


661
01:11:51.587 --> 01:11:54.423
- Right.
- It's been taken out once since April.


662
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:58.375
- By who?
- Um... Derek Lessing.


663

Thank you.

664

- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

669
01:12:58.112 --> 01:13:02.360
Well, that's hard to say.
Derek was into some weird pathology.


670
01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:10.249
I thought he was one of your people.

671
01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:13.122
He hasn't sold me anything
for over a year.


672
01:13:18.215 --> 01:13:22.131
Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Drop it.

673

I wanted to keep things civil with us,

but levine can be hard to manage.

675
01:13:39.403 --> 01:13:41.527
He's starting to get out of hand.

676
01:13:42.948 --> 01:13:45.701
And that blood you gave him
fried his rig.


677

None of those samples
lasted more than a day.

a lot of dangerous attention.

So here's what.

682

I'm gonna give this back to you

683

699

She's a Professor
of biotechnological law in California.

Now, she discovered that vole & tesser

735
01:21:10.563 --> 01:21:16.020
had recently patented
a genetically modified virus.


736
01:21:16.193 --> 01:21:19.860
It's quite likely the source
of Hannah's and your infection.

- A patent?
- Mm. What it means, it's unclear to me.

01:30:18.152 --> 01:30:20.146
Bad dream?

772
01:30:38.714 --> 01:30:40.589
I think sexual politics
are involved also


773
01:30:40.758 --> 01:30:43.879
because of cell penetration
by the virus.


774
01:30:44.053 --> 01:30:46.047
The original host
takes on the role of the male


775
01:30:46.222 --> 01:30:48.891
and the newly infected is the female.

776
01:30:49.058 --> 01:30:52.642
And then the infected changes gender
to infect others,


777
01:30:52.812 --> 01:30:55.268
sort of the way
the reef fish change gender.


778
01:30:56.357 --> 01:30:59.145
It probably says something
about your customers.


779
01:31:07.201 --> 01:31:11.698
Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for the way you're being treated here.


780
01:31:13.082 --> 01:31:16.534
If it had been up to me,
we would have taken better care of you.

[Levine sighs]

782
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:21.883
But we gotta get this thing finished and
on the market while people still care,


783
01:31:22.008 --> 01:31:24.713
otherwise there's no point.

784
01:31:25.594 --> 01:31:29.640
Besides, you owe me
for what you did to my rig.

802

[March] I'd like to tell you something

<i>Oh? And what would that be?</i>

804
01:35:07.692 --> 01:35:11.940
The contract Hannah geist
signed with Lucas


805
01:35:12.113 --> 01:35:13.774
prevents you from selling her diseases,

806
01:35:13.948 --> 01:35:19.286
but a... but a virus
you built and patented yourself


807
01:35:19.453 --> 01:35:24.200
would remain your property
even if it passed through her body.


808
01:35:25.751 --> 01:35:29.453
You could infect her, recover the sample

809
01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:32.087
and then sell it
as a vole & tesser exclusive.


810
01:35:33.175 --> 01:35:35.632
<i>Ls that true?</i>

811
01:35:35.803 --> 01:35:39.387
It's why you commissioned the virus
from Derek Lessing


812
01:35:39.557 --> 01:35:42.808
and why he infected her
during a house call.


813
01:35:44.979 --> 01:35:47.518
<i>It's a great loophole, isn't it?</i>

814
01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:51.475
<i>My idea, of course.</i>
<i>We stood to make a lot of money.</i>

01:35:52.903 --> 01:35:56.024
<i>Unfortunately there was a problem</i>
<i>with your friend Derek's build.</i>


816
01:35:56.198 --> 01:35:59.319
I wanna know if it can be cured.

817
01:35:59.493 --> 01:36:01.119
<i>I think so.</i>

818
01:36:01.287 --> 01:36:03.826
<i>However, producing a cure</i>
<i>would be costly,</i>


819
01:36:03.998 --> 01:36:05.708
<i>and as you acquired the virus</i>
<i>on your own,</i>


820
01:36:05.833 --> 01:36:09.036
<i>we feel no responsibility</i>
<i>for your condition.</i>

We're not sure, but, you know... no?

824
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:48.411
Well, this is certainly
a heartbreaking turn of events.


825
01:36:48.584 --> 01:36:53.046
I mean, this really puts things
in perspective, doesn't it, you know?


826
01:36:53.214 --> 01:36:55.587
Now, I would happily
do something if I could,


827
01:36:55.758 --> 01:36:59.923
and the thought of a collaboration
between miss geist and our company


828
01:37:00.096 --> 01:37:01.472
is very appealing.

829
01:37:01.639 --> 01:37:05.258
Unfortunately,
my specialist here has advised me


830
01:37:05.434 --> 01:37:08.436
that she's too far gone to be saved.

831

[Woman]
You'll be hearing from our lawyers.


832
01:37:11.565 --> 01:37:15.434
[Tesser] I think you'll find
we've taken the necessary precautions.

Now, if you'll excuse me...

834
01:37:19.115 --> 01:37:25.403
You know,
while I was a guest at your clinic...


835
01:37:27.164 --> 01:37:30.997
I... I had some time
to think things over.


836
01:37:34.213 --> 01:37:38.461
I've been seeing
a little more clearly since then.


837
01:37:42.763 --> 01:37:48.636
For example, I can see
that this is an important moment.


838
01:37:50.479 --> 01:37:55.356
I can see an opportunity here...

839
01:37:59.363 --> 01:38:02.614
even in the face
of such a devastating tragedy.


840
01:38:05.286 --> 01:38:10.328
We... have a chance to innovate,

841
01:38:10.499 --> 01:38:16.954
and to do it in a way
that will benefit you both.


842
01:38:20.343 --> 01:38:23.214
The technology already exists...

843
01:38:25.014 --> 01:38:27.008
and I know where to find it.

844
01:38:31.562 --> 01:38:34.137
Allow me to take
a moment of your time.

845
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:40.360
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>
<i>my mother used to ask me,</i>


846
01:38:40.529 --> 01:38:42.689
<i>"what do you wanna be</i>
<i>when you grow up?"</i>


847
01:38:42.865 --> 01:38:46.698
<i>And I would tell her,</i>
<i>"I don't wanna grow up."</i>


848
01:38:46.869 --> 01:38:50.405
<i>"I wanna stay young and beautiful."</i>

849
01:38:50.581 --> 01:38:53.916
<i>So I guess in a way</i>
<i>this is my childhood dream realised.</i>


850
01:38:55.503 --> 01:38:58.421

[Tesser]
From the perspective of the virus,


854
01:39:16.816 --> 01:39:19.522
the human being is irrelevant.

855
01:39:19.694 --> 01:39:25.199
What matters is the system
that allows it to function.


856
01:39:26.242 --> 01:39:30.869
Skin cells, nerve cells,
the right home for the right disease.


857
01:39:31.956 --> 01:39:34.911
Within our afterlife capsule,

858
01:39:35.084 --> 01:39:40.423
the system that is Hannah geist's body
has been perpetuated,


859
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:44.209
even expanded
beyond what existed during her lifetime.


860
01:39:44.385 --> 01:39:46.959
Make no mistake, however,

861
01:39:47.138 --> 01:39:50.424
this is not some glorified cell steak.

862
01:39:50.599 --> 01:39:52.344
Everything inside this housing

863
01:39:52.518 --> 01:39:55.224
is either part of the original body

864
01:39:55.396 --> 01:39:57.520
or has been grown directly from it

865
01:39:57.690 --> 01:40:01.736
as a result of our patented
cellgarden technology.


866

Our chief technician, Syd march,

867
01:40:04.905 --> 01:40:08.987
is about to load the latest virus
into the system,


868
01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.289
where it will infect Hannah's body

869
01:40:13.456 --> 01:40:19.127
before being sold as part of our
vole & tesser afterlife product line.


870
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:24.757
Now, this is just a sneak peek.

871
01:40:24.925 --> 01:40:27.762
If you wanna know
the nature of the infection,


872
01:40:27.928 --> 01:40:31.678
you'll have to wait
until it's announced officially


873
01:40:31.849 --> 01:40:35.930
at our product conference
at the end of this month.
