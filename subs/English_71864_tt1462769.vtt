1
00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:13.813
James and Cynthia Green?

2
00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:15.690
- Yes.
- Right this way, please.


3
00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:35.710
Okay.
James and Cynthia Green.


4
00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.837
Thirteen Oak Lane Road, Stanleyville.

5
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:39.005
Yeah.

6
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:43.592
Wait. You didn't answer
what makes you qualified.


7
00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:46.679
Oh, we know. There wasn't much space.

8
00:01:46.763 --> 00:01:48.264
We had so much to say.

9
00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:50.641
Also here on page four.

10
00:01:51.768 --> 00:01:52.768
In response to,

11
00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:54.145
"What experience or experiences

12
00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.771
"have best prepared you,"

13
00:01:57.107 --> 00:01:58.983
you only wrote "Timothy."

14
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.694
Yes.

15
00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.200
The only chance
you two have is


16
00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:10.119
if you put it all on the table.

17
00:02:10.203 --> 00:02:11.412
We agree.

18
00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:15.332
That's why we want
to use our time to tell you our story.


19
00:02:16.877 --> 00:02:17.960
Okay.

20
00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.421
There's just one thing.

21
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:23.632
You're going to find it hard to believe.

22
00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:29.138
This all began last September.

23
00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:30.931
We'd been trying for a number of years,

24
00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:33.225
and Dr. Hunt finally gave us the news.

25
00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.813
First of all, you couldn't
have tried harder.


26
00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:39.648
Or done more.

27
00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:45.321
We have explored every medical option
at a great cost to you.


28
00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:48.699
But there comes a point when you...

29
00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:50.951
You have to accept...

30
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.164
I am so sorry.

31
00:02:57.334 --> 00:02:58.417
Hold it!

32
00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:03.714
Come on, honey. Come on. Come on.

33
00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:08.928
Oh! Can you push the button for me?
Push it right there.


34
00:03:09.012 --> 00:03:11.847
Good job! What would I do without you?

35
00:03:11.932 --> 00:03:13.015
High-five!

36
00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.442
So we drove back home.

37
00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:34.245
We went back to work
and on with our day.


38
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.171
We'll get a puppy.

39
00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:48.717
I don't want a puppy!

40
00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:48.027
- Bye.
- Bye.


41
00:05:09.966 --> 00:05:11.050
Hey, Tommy.

42
00:05:11.134 --> 00:05:13.552
Here you go. I'll see you inside.

43
00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.473
Good job.

44
00:05:24.064 --> 00:05:25.397
Like all good stories,

45
00:05:25.482 --> 00:05:27.608
the Stanleyville pencil factory,

46
00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:31.528
this museum and
this town begins with a dream.


47
00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:34.240
Stanley Crudstaff, our patron.

48
00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:36.450
This is his original desk over here.
Please follow me.


49
00:06:16.574 --> 00:06:17.908
You hungry?

50
00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:27.167
Hey, sis!

51
00:06:27.252 --> 00:06:29.461
Uh, just checking in to make sure
you're still up for tomorrow.


52
00:06:29.546 --> 00:06:31.463
We'd be willing to host.

53
00:06:31.548 --> 00:06:34.133
The kids just bought Bart a new grill.
You wouldn't believe it.


54
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.721
Hi, this is Allen Rust
with the Sisters of Mercy Hospital.


55
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.599
Please call me back about
an outstanding balance. Thank you.


56
00:07:10.253 --> 00:07:11.420
Honey.

57
00:07:23.558 --> 00:07:25.017
We're moving on.

58
00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:44.453
You can see
we've got some dirt here.


59
00:07:44.537 --> 00:07:45.537
But in order to
make good growing soil...


60
00:07:46.748 --> 00:07:49.124
...and a good growing bed
for your garden,


61
00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:52.169
you've got to get down
a good 12 to 18 inches.


62
00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:55.297
I can't do it. 
I can't move on.

63
00:07:57.175 --> 00:07:58.509
Then move out of the way.

64
00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:04.640
For years, we've been thinking about

65
00:08:04.724 --> 00:08:06.725
what our kid would have been like.

66
00:08:06.976 --> 00:08:08.018
Don't.

67
00:08:08.103 --> 00:08:09.311
We can move on tomorrow.

68
00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:11.522
Just for tonight,

69
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.067
can we have a kid?

70
00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:17.069
You heard what the doctor said.

71
00:08:17.153 --> 00:08:18.445
Give it up! Give it up.

72
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.615
There we go. Never give up!

73
00:08:25.662 --> 00:08:27.162
Our kid

74
00:08:28.039 --> 00:08:31.083
would never give up.

75
00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:36.338
You know what else I think?

76
00:08:36.464 --> 00:08:37.798
- I can't.
- Our kid


77
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:41.593
would have your good heart.

78
00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.179
This isn't funny, Jim.

79
00:08:45.014 --> 00:08:46.557
But our kid would be funny.

80
00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:50.144
Not make fun of other people funny,

81
00:08:50.353 --> 00:08:52.354
or burp and fart funny,

82
00:08:52.439 --> 00:08:55.023
but funny like...

83
00:08:56.526 --> 00:09:04.700
Funny like Uncle Bub.

84
00:09:16.337 --> 00:09:18.464
You know that, uh,

85
00:09:20.383 --> 00:09:22.301
that kind of kid that you always believe.

86
00:09:22.385 --> 00:09:24.428
Someone honest. 
You want a truth-teller.

87
00:09:24.512 --> 00:09:25.471
Yeah, I do. I want one like that.

88
00:09:25.555 --> 00:09:26.638
But our kid can't be perfect.

89
00:09:26.723 --> 00:09:28.098
I don't want one of
those annoying perfect kids.


90
00:09:28.183 --> 00:09:29.183
How about this?

91
00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:30.767
Honest to a fault.

92
00:09:30.852 --> 00:09:32.561
- Yes! We have a winner.
- Yes! Yes!


93
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.148
- Would our kid be musical?
- Definitely.


94
00:09:36.232 --> 00:09:38.150
Clarinet like me, drums like you, or...

95
00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:40.194
I don't know what kind of instrument.

96
00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:42.529
All I know is our kid...

97
00:09:42.614 --> 00:09:44.615
Our kid would rock!

98
00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:46.283
- Ah! We so agree.
- Our kid would rock!


99
00:09:46.367 --> 00:09:47.409
Write that.

100
00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:49.995
Artistically.

101
00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:51.413
Picasso with a pencil.

102
00:09:51.498 --> 00:09:52.623
Yes.

103
00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:55.584
A glass half-full person.

104
00:09:56.377 --> 00:09:57.711
Love and be loved.

105
00:09:58.588 --> 00:10:00.964
How great an athlete are you picturing?

106
00:10:01.341 --> 00:10:02.424
You were terrible at soccer.

107
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:03.800
That's not true.

108
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.302
Not true.

109
00:10:05.386 --> 00:10:06.678
I was a big klutz.

110
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.640
All right.
How about this? How about this?


111
00:10:09.724 --> 00:10:12.184
Just once, our kid,

112
00:10:12.268 --> 00:10:13.852
amazing kid,

113
00:10:14.103 --> 00:10:16.647
got to score the winning goal.

114
00:10:24.405 --> 00:10:26.615
Touchdown! Go, Green!

115
00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:28.492
Yes! That's our kid!

116
00:10:37.544 --> 00:10:38.794
Now what?

117
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:09.963
We got some rain.

118
00:14:15.678 --> 00:14:18.764
Everything
is going to be fine.


119
00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:21.850
Honey, did you say something?

120
00:14:23.436 --> 00:14:24.561
I said we...

121
00:14:26.063 --> 00:14:27.522
What?

122
00:14:58.054 --> 00:14:59.513
I think it's gone.

123
00:15:01.808 --> 00:15:02.849
Jim.

124
00:15:10.817 --> 00:15:13.193
Wait. Wait.

125
00:15:32.964 --> 00:15:34.047
Oh!

126
00:15:49.021 --> 00:15:50.063
Hi.

127
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:51.773
- Hi.
- Hi.


128
00:15:55.695 --> 00:15:56.778
I'm Timothy.

129
00:16:02.034 --> 00:16:03.493
That's a common name.

130
00:16:07.623 --> 00:16:09.040
Well, can we get you cleaned up?

131
00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:12.627
Yeah, um, do you have a towel?

132
00:16:13.254 --> 00:16:14.963
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.


133
00:16:21.345 --> 00:16:22.429
This feels about right.

134
00:16:25.975 --> 00:16:27.559
911.
State your emergency.


135
00:16:27.643 --> 00:16:29.603
Yeah, I'd like to report a missing...

136
00:16:29.687 --> 00:16:32.188
This is Jim Green. 13 Oak Lane Road.

137
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.858
Hey, Jim. It's Marty from the factory.

138
00:16:34.942 --> 00:16:36.776
I'm just picking up a few extra hours.

139
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:38.153
Oh, Marty.

140
00:16:39.655 --> 00:16:42.073
We have in our possession a...

141
00:16:42.158 --> 00:16:44.618
Ah, God, I don't
know how to say this.

142
00:16:45.953 --> 00:16:48.455
Has anybody reported a missing...

143
00:16:52.877 --> 00:16:56.004
Jim? Jim, are you there?

144
00:16:57.465 --> 00:16:58.673
I ran away from home once.

145
00:16:59.634 --> 00:17:01.092
I can't remember why.

146
00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:03.929
And I didn't get very far.

147
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.681
What about you?

148
00:17:08.851 --> 00:17:10.101
Did you run away?

149
00:17:10.853 --> 00:17:11.895
No.

150
00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:14.814
Come on.

151
00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:16.900
I bet your parents are worried and

152
00:17:22.323 --> 00:17:23.573
wondering.

153
00:17:24.575 --> 00:17:26.201
Cindy!

154
00:17:26.786 --> 00:17:27.911
Honey!

155
00:17:29.205 --> 00:17:30.580
There's something you need to see.

156
00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:32.707
Actually there's something
you need to see.


157
00:17:37.171 --> 00:17:38.213
Hi.

158
00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:41.466
Well, look who cleaned up good.

159
00:17:42.718 --> 00:17:43.718
Er...

160
00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:46.221
Mmm.

161
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.015
Hmm!

162
00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:50.558
Hmm?

163
00:17:50.643 --> 00:17:51.643
Hmm.

164
00:17:59.986 --> 00:18:01.569
- Are those...
- Yes. Mmm-hmm.


165
00:18:04.615 --> 00:18:06.741
Please don't ask about my leaves.

166
00:18:06.993 --> 00:18:08.159
- Okay.
- No.


167
00:18:08.494 --> 00:18:09.619
But you can look at them.

168
00:18:10.746 --> 00:18:11.913
If you want.

169
00:18:31.267 --> 00:18:32.600
Not everybody has these.

170
00:18:33.936 --> 00:18:35.020
Yep.

171
00:18:36.063 --> 00:18:37.647
Do you mind

172
00:18:37.732 --> 00:18:38.898
if I...

173
00:18:43.821 --> 00:18:45.238
Sorry.

174
00:18:51.662 --> 00:18:54.205
Now my mind is racing
with even more questions.


175
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.791
Honey, you need to go look out back.

176
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.634
I'll just be right outside.

177
00:19:13.726 --> 00:19:16.853
Hi.

178
00:19:56.685 --> 00:19:57.769
Oh.

179
00:20:29.051 --> 00:20:30.051
Oh.

180
00:20:30.219 --> 00:20:32.178
Oh, hey! Donnie!

181
00:20:32.471 --> 00:20:33.888
False alarm!

182
00:20:35.015 --> 00:20:36.141
We thought we had a burglar.

183
00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:39.853
It was just a raccoon family

184
00:20:39.937 --> 00:20:41.980
that we, we...
I chased it away, so everything's...


185
00:20:42.857 --> 00:20:43.898
- Everything's fine.
- You sure?


186
00:20:44.275 --> 00:20:46.818
Yeah, we're sure. 
Everything's good.

187
00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:48.736
Jim, is there something
you're not telling us?


188
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:49.821
Yeah.

189
00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:51.072
Uh, no. Why?

190
00:20:54.118 --> 00:20:56.369
Come on, Jim. We're on
strict water rationing.


191
00:20:56.745 --> 00:20:58.329
Turn in your sprinkler,
and we'll let this one slide.


192
00:20:58.914 --> 00:20:59.998
But it rained.

193
00:21:02.376 --> 00:21:03.459
No, it didn't.

194
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.421
Unless it only rained in your yard.

195
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.343
What do you know?

196
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.095
Amazing, huh?

197
00:21:15.514 --> 00:21:17.223
Well, Green, it's your lucky day.

198
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.393
Yes, it is.

199
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:24.147
There you go. You had the right idea.

200
00:21:25.107 --> 00:21:27.066
Back in there, back in there. All righty.

201
00:21:28.986 --> 00:21:30.111
Thank you.

202
00:21:30.821 --> 00:21:31.946
You're welcome.

203
00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:38.328
We really like to eat fresh, healthy food
here. A lot of vegetables


204
00:21:38.412 --> 00:21:40.038
from our own garden.

205
00:21:40.122 --> 00:21:41.789
I guess I'm known primarily
for my tomatoes.


206
00:21:41.874 --> 00:21:43.041
I do a lot of canning.

207
00:21:43.125 --> 00:21:46.044
But I'm also a firm believer
in the late-night snack.


208
00:21:46.128 --> 00:21:47.879
Hey, how is it going?

209
00:21:47.963 --> 00:21:49.130
Good.

210
00:21:50.466 --> 00:21:52.175
This is Jim, and I'm Cindy.

211
00:21:53.469 --> 00:21:55.970
Yeah, feel free to call us...

212
00:21:57.223 --> 00:21:58.389
- Cindy and Jim.
- Cindy and Jim.


213
00:21:58.474 --> 00:21:59.641
Why would I?

214
00:22:01.435 --> 00:22:03.144
That's no problem. You can...

215
00:22:04.146 --> 00:22:05.563
- Call us Mr. and Mrs. Green.
- Mr. Green.


216
00:22:05.648 --> 00:22:06.856
Not many people do, but...

217
00:22:06.941 --> 00:22:09.108
Mom, really?

218
00:22:09.485 --> 00:22:10.818
Dad.

219
00:22:19.995 --> 00:22:22.205
Can I talk to you, Jim?

220
00:22:27.294 --> 00:22:29.087
- He called me "Mom."
- Yes, he did.


221
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:31.881
- He called you "Dad."
- I know. I know.


222
00:22:33.008 --> 00:22:34.467
Fifty-four girl names on the list,

223
00:22:34.551 --> 00:22:36.302
and there was one boy, and it was...

224
00:22:36.387 --> 00:22:37.971
Timothy.

225
00:22:42.142 --> 00:22:43.518
Is he for us?

226
00:22:44.311 --> 00:22:45.853
I'm getting that feeling.

227
00:23:16.343 --> 00:23:18.386
- Be careful.
- Yeah.


228
00:23:30.316 --> 00:23:31.607
Careful, careful.

229
00:23:39.408 --> 00:23:40.950
There you go.

230
00:24:02.598 --> 00:24:04.223
It was as if, all of a sudden,

231
00:24:04.308 --> 00:24:05.558
everything had changed.

232
00:24:05.642 --> 00:24:07.018
There he was, leaves and all.

233
00:24:07.102 --> 00:24:08.353
Didn't matter where he came from.

234
00:24:08.437 --> 00:24:10.313
- He was ours.
- Yeah, we were his.


235
00:24:10.397 --> 00:24:12.023
- And we were a family.
- We were a family.


236
00:24:13.942 --> 00:24:16.235
Have we lost you? 
Are you still with us?

237
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:18.279
It's kind of crazy, right?

238
00:24:19.114 --> 00:24:20.281
I've heard crazier.

239
00:24:21.408 --> 00:24:22.533
- Really?
- No.


240
00:24:23.744 --> 00:24:26.746
That said, it's your time
to use as you choose.


241
00:24:27.456 --> 00:24:29.082
I just have two words for you.

242
00:24:30.042 --> 00:24:31.167
Tick tock.

243
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.378
- Oh, right.
- Oh.


244
00:24:33.462 --> 00:24:34.629
Okay.

245
00:24:35.214 --> 00:24:36.214
So...

246
00:24:53.357 --> 00:24:54.649
I think she forgot.

247
00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:56.401
Ah, you're always early.

248
00:24:59.321 --> 00:25:00.530
Hello!

249
00:25:02.533 --> 00:25:03.574
Hi.

250
00:25:04.451 --> 00:25:05.701
Hello there.

251
00:25:09.498 --> 00:25:10.998
I'm Timothy.

252
00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:12.125
Nice to meet you, Timothy.

253
00:25:12.209 --> 00:25:13.292
Jim!

254
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.547
I got here last night.
I came from the garden.


255
00:25:18.674 --> 00:25:19.966
Oh.

256
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:21.217
That's unusual.

257
00:25:21.301 --> 00:25:23.010
Hi, sis! Okay, good.

258
00:25:23.095 --> 00:25:24.470
Well, I'm glad you guys met. Jim?

259
00:25:24.555 --> 00:25:25.596
Yeah!

260
00:25:25.681 --> 00:25:27.014
I'm coming. Hey. Hi, Brenda.

261
00:25:27.433 --> 00:25:28.599
Who was that?

262
00:25:29.268 --> 00:25:30.601
- Oh!
- Are we early?


263
00:25:30.686 --> 00:25:32.353
Oh, gosh.

264
00:25:33.188 --> 00:25:34.188
I didn't think so.

265
00:25:35.441 --> 00:25:36.482
Jim?

266
00:25:38.152 --> 00:25:39.485
There we go.

267
00:25:40.154 --> 00:25:42.113
- Jim!
- I'm on it!


268
00:25:43.157 --> 00:25:45.074
Okay, kiddo,
you ready to meet some people?


269
00:25:45.159 --> 00:25:48.119
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good, because we're not.


270
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.246
Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Good.


271
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.497
- Okay.
- Okay.


272
00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.792
Now, all the kids
you're going to meet today,


273
00:25:55.043 --> 00:25:56.627
they come from their moms' tummies.

274
00:25:57.379 --> 00:25:58.504
Whereas you come from...

275
00:25:58.589 --> 00:26:00.298
- The garden.
- Yes!


276
00:26:00.382 --> 00:26:03.217
I don't know about you,
but I have a tendency to over-share.


277
00:26:03.552 --> 00:26:06.596
So maybe we just keep
some things between us for now.


278
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.390
Like the garden or your leaves.

279
00:26:09.725 --> 00:26:11.058
Why?

280
00:26:14.605 --> 00:26:16.397
Because they may not understand.

281
00:26:17.816 --> 00:26:20.359
Can you understand
that they may not understand?


282
00:26:20.444 --> 00:26:22.320
- I think so.
- Yes?


283
00:26:22.696 --> 00:26:24.614
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good!


284
00:26:25.073 --> 00:26:26.574
Let's go get ready to meet some people.

285
00:26:27.284 --> 00:26:28.367
Okay.

286
00:26:28.744 --> 00:26:30.703
Hold the corner down. Thank you.

287
00:26:30.829 --> 00:26:33.122
Hey. Hey, everybody.

288
00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.374
Here's what's happening.

289
00:26:36.793 --> 00:26:39.337
It's no secret that
we've been trying to have a family


290
00:26:40.672 --> 00:26:42.173
and we got some good news.

291
00:26:42.841 --> 00:26:44.175
I know it's all of a sudden.

292
00:26:44.843 --> 00:26:46.260
His name is Timothy.

293
00:26:46.553 --> 00:26:50.765
And please don't ask
too many questions.


294
00:26:52.017 --> 00:26:53.226
When were
you going to tell me,


295
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.853
and how old is he,
and where did he come from?


296
00:26:57.272 --> 00:27:00.733
It was all very sudden
and kind of miraculous.


297
00:27:00.817 --> 00:27:02.151
Huh.

298
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.072
I mean, I thought
you were trying to have a real kid.


299
00:27:06.156 --> 00:27:07.865
I mean, you know, one of your own.

300
00:27:09.618 --> 00:27:12.161
He felt like mine
from the first time I saw him.


301
00:27:12.246 --> 00:27:13.371
I'm sorry.

302
00:27:13.664 --> 00:27:16.249
These are the coals.
I'm going to put that down for a second.


303
00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:19.794
Well, with a little heads-up, I could've
helped with the clothes at least.


304
00:27:22.464 --> 00:27:23.631
Hey, guys.

305
00:27:23.799 --> 00:27:25.091
- Hey.
- Hi.


306
00:27:25.175 --> 00:27:27.260
- How's it going?
- Yeah, good. You know.


307
00:27:27.344 --> 00:27:28.553
- Is it going?
- Yeah.


308
00:27:28.637 --> 00:27:30.137
How's everything going over there?

309
00:27:31.598 --> 00:27:32.723
Who invited him?

310
00:27:36.478 --> 00:27:37.812
I didn't think he would come.

311
00:27:38.855 --> 00:27:40.147
Hi.

312
00:27:40.232 --> 00:27:42.358
- Oh, hello.
- Hey, Timothy.


313
00:27:42.442 --> 00:27:43.442
Hey.

314
00:27:43.569 --> 00:27:45.278
This is my dad.

315
00:27:45.362 --> 00:27:46.487
Hi, Grandpa.

316
00:27:46.822 --> 00:27:48.656
Uh...

317
00:27:49.866 --> 00:27:51.325
Call me Big Jim.

318
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.494
Okay, bye!

319
00:27:53.662 --> 00:27:54.620
Okay.

320
00:27:54.705 --> 00:27:56.163
Timothy, come here.

321
00:27:57.666 --> 00:27:58.791
"Grandpa"?

322
00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:02.837
This is my Aunt
Mel and my Uncle Bub.

323
00:28:03.589 --> 00:28:04.839
They practically raised me.

324
00:28:05.507 --> 00:28:07.592
- Hello, Timothy.
- Hi.


325
00:28:07.676 --> 00:28:08.843
Hello, young man.

326
00:28:09.261 --> 00:28:10.761
Hello, old boy.

327
00:28:12.306 --> 00:28:13.639
Did you know I invented

328
00:28:13.724 --> 00:28:16.392
the peanut butter and jelly sandwich?

329
00:28:16.685 --> 00:28:18.769
Did you know I'm a
big fan of your work?

330
00:28:21.356 --> 00:28:22.481
Well, goodbye.

331
00:28:24.192 --> 00:28:25.568
- Hi, I'm Timothy.
- Hi.


332
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.695
Hi. Hi.

333
00:28:28.697 --> 00:28:29.697
Hi.

334
00:28:29.781 --> 00:28:31.407
- Hi.
- Hey.


335
00:28:32.492 --> 00:28:34.577
So you all came from
your mom's tummy?


336
00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:38.372
How was that?

337
00:28:41.627 --> 00:28:42.793
This all you got?

338
00:28:42.878 --> 00:28:44.045
I know.

339
00:28:45.672 --> 00:28:46.797
Who wants to play?

340
00:28:47.257 --> 00:28:50.384
The object,
boys and girls, is to dodge,


341
00:28:50.469 --> 00:28:51.927
so how about we start with you?

342
00:28:52.012 --> 00:28:53.012
Oh!

343
00:28:53.889 --> 00:28:55.306
Out! You're out!

344
00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:56.599
You got to move!

345
00:28:56.683 --> 00:28:58.893
You got to dodge the ball, Timothy.

346
00:28:59.895 --> 00:29:01.812
Come on!
Gotta move, gotta move, gotta move.


347
00:29:01.897 --> 00:29:03.189
Into prison. You're out.

348
00:29:03.273 --> 00:29:04.273
You have to coach him

349
00:29:04.358 --> 00:29:06.233
because he clearly doesn't understand.

350
00:29:06.318 --> 00:29:07.943
Timothy, Timothy. Timothy, Timothy.

351
00:29:08.028 --> 00:29:09.362
Look, it's just down to five kids.

352
00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.364
Move your feet. Move around.
Keep an eye on the ball.


353
00:29:12.324 --> 00:29:13.407
You're going down.

354
00:29:14.284 --> 00:29:16.494
Stick and move,
stick and move! Come on!


355
00:29:16.578 --> 00:29:17.578
Oh!

356
00:29:17.663 --> 00:29:19.246
Get in there. Go. Help him out.

357
00:29:19.414 --> 00:29:20.414
Oh!

358
00:29:22.292 --> 00:29:23.292
Ahh!

359
00:29:23.418 --> 00:29:25.336
Let's just call this...

360
00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.129
I don't think this is a good idea.

361
00:29:27.214 --> 00:29:28.422
You're not going
to spoil all the fun, are you?


362
00:29:28.507 --> 00:29:30.841
- No, but... Could you just...
- Go, go, go, go.


363
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:33.552
Okay. Hey. Here we go,
here we go, here we go!


364
00:29:33.637 --> 00:29:35.054
You got to dodge the ball.
Move your feet.


365
00:29:35.305 --> 00:29:37.848
Take it easy, Big Jim.
This is not the Olympics.


366
00:29:37.933 --> 00:29:38.933
The thing about these kids is

367
00:29:39.017 --> 00:29:40.267
you never know what you're getting.

368
00:29:40.352 --> 00:29:43.270
They have issues sometimes. Medical or

369
00:29:43.939 --> 00:29:44.897
otherwise.

370
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:46.440
And if he has any issues,
we'll deal with them.


371
00:29:47.401 --> 00:29:49.151
- Like any normal kid.
- Okay.


372
00:29:58.453 --> 00:29:59.829
I mean, that's not normal.

373
00:30:52.591 --> 00:30:53.591
Hey!

374
00:30:53.675 --> 00:30:54.675
Oh, my...

375
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.010
Hey. What did you do that for?

376
00:30:56.094 --> 00:30:58.387
Out! You are... Uh-oh!

377
00:30:58.472 --> 00:31:00.765
- Come on. It's dodgeball.
- Big Jim, honestly.


378
00:31:00.849 --> 00:31:02.975
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,


379
00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:05.811
but what did you say to your father

380
00:31:05.896 --> 00:31:08.439
after he bonked the boy
with leaves in the head?


381
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:11.734
Hmm. It's complicated.

382
00:31:11.818 --> 00:31:13.444
- I didn't say anything.
- Mmm-hmm.


383
00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:14.945
Really?

384
00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:15.988
But I made a vow

385
00:31:16.072 --> 00:31:17.948
that I would do things
differently than my dad.


386
00:31:18.033 --> 00:31:19.116
I would be much better...

387
00:31:19.201 --> 00:31:22.203
Jim decided that
he would be the father he never had.


388
00:31:24.372 --> 00:31:25.956
What about you?

389
00:31:26.333 --> 00:31:27.500
I decided that

390
00:31:28.084 --> 00:31:30.795
our son would not be
seen as different or weird.


391
00:31:31.797 --> 00:31:33.714
He'd be treated like a normal kid.

392
00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:34.840
Yeah.

393
00:31:34.925 --> 00:31:36.258
Because that's what he was going to be.

394
00:31:37.093 --> 00:31:39.428
Just a... A normal kid.

395
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.056
Incredible.

396
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:47.061
Good color, strong veins.

397
00:31:47.145 --> 00:31:49.480
Yeah. They're beautiful, aren't they?

398
00:31:49.564 --> 00:31:50.898
Most unusual.

399
00:31:53.693 --> 00:31:54.902
Can you cut them off?

400
00:31:55.612 --> 00:31:57.822
But they're perfectly healthy.
Why would you...


401
00:31:59.074 --> 00:32:00.574
Oh, right.

402
00:32:02.452 --> 00:32:05.579
Timothy, Reggie and I go way back.

403
00:32:06.998 --> 00:32:08.499
He's amazing with plants,

404
00:32:08.583 --> 00:32:11.126
and if there's anyone
who can do this, he's the guy.


405
00:32:12.003 --> 00:32:14.672
You know, when I was your age,

406
00:32:14.756 --> 00:32:16.090
I had a wart on my thumb.

407
00:32:16.675 --> 00:32:18.676
The other kids,
they used to call me "The Warthog."


408
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.135
Kids can be so cruel.

409
00:32:20.595 --> 00:32:23.430
You know, my dad,
he had a doctor burn that puppy off,


410
00:32:24.432 --> 00:32:27.059
and after that,
nobody made fun of me at all.


411
00:32:27.143 --> 00:32:29.311
We don't want anyone
to make fun of you.


412
00:32:29.604 --> 00:32:31.856
That's what this is about.
What do you think?


413
00:32:32.983 --> 00:32:35.067
Okay. Go for it.

414
00:32:37.028 --> 00:32:38.112
Okay.

415
00:32:42.158 --> 00:32:45.202
Okay. You may feel a slight pinch.

416
00:32:45.537 --> 00:32:46.912
Okay. Take a deep breath.

417
00:32:48.498 --> 00:32:49.665
We're here, pal.

418
00:33:00.969 --> 00:33:02.636
This isn't going to work, is it?

419
00:33:03.471 --> 00:33:04.513
No.

420
00:33:06.099 --> 00:33:08.058
You take them
to the doctor, right?


421
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.394
You give them medicine
that doesn't taste good,


422
00:33:10.478 --> 00:33:11.979
they get shots that hurt.

423
00:33:12.564 --> 00:33:13.981
That's the job.

424
00:33:14.649 --> 00:33:16.233
We thought we were doing ourjob.

425
00:33:19.654 --> 00:33:22.031
What did you put in there?
He's about to fall over.


426
00:33:22.115 --> 00:33:24.074
Anything he might need.
Notebooks, pencils.


427
00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:26.452
There's a box of tissues
on the bottom and some Band-Aids.


428
00:33:26.536 --> 00:33:28.954
There's a whole first aid kit
actually, just in case...


429
00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:30.831
Variety of healthy snacks,

430
00:33:30.916 --> 00:33:32.708
treats and Graham Crackers.
I know you like them.


431
00:33:32.792 --> 00:33:35.169
And then a flashlight
and some batteries.


432
00:33:35.253 --> 00:33:37.171
Mom, I think I
can handle it from here.

433
00:33:38.089 --> 00:33:39.924
Oh, there's an extra pair of socks!

434
00:33:42.677 --> 00:33:43.844
- Have a great day!
- Okay, bye!


435
00:33:43.929 --> 00:33:45.095
That's too much pressure.

436
00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.722
Have the day you have.

437
00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:56.732
This morning you were late for work,

438
00:33:56.816 --> 00:33:58.233
there's a jelly stain on your sweater.

439
00:33:58.318 --> 00:34:00.778
And frankly you seem
inappropriately cheerful.


440
00:34:00.862 --> 00:34:02.154
I know, but there is good reason.

441
00:34:02.238 --> 00:34:03.656
We've had a young boy come to stay...

442
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.115
Is there something about my expression

443
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.076
that suggests I'm
the least bit interested?


444
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.702
No, ma'am, nothing
about your expression is...


445
00:34:08.787 --> 00:34:10.704
And you continue to talk because...

446
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:11.872
I'm sorry.

447
00:34:22.008 --> 00:34:23.217
Hello?

448
00:34:23.718 --> 00:34:27.388
Best-case scenario, reduced hours.

449
00:34:28.264 --> 00:34:30.265
Limited layoffs. Limited.

450
00:34:30.392 --> 00:34:33.310
Like you lose yourjob
and you lose yourjob.


451
00:34:33.395 --> 00:34:35.562
Not you specifically, but some of you.

452
00:34:36.731 --> 00:34:38.273
Worst-case scenario,

453
00:34:38.358 --> 00:34:41.318
my aunt and my father will have
no choice but to close the factory.


454
00:34:42.487 --> 00:34:43.904
I know.

455
00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:45.656
I don't want that to happen.

456
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.824
Nobody wants that to happen.

457
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:48.283
And I'm not saying that that's...

458
00:34:48.368 --> 00:34:49.827
I'm sorry, Green?

459
00:34:50.078 --> 00:34:51.120
Are we disturbing you?

460
00:34:52.414 --> 00:34:53.414
Hi, honey.

461
00:34:53.498 --> 00:34:54.999
Jim, the school called.

462
00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:56.875
- What's the matter?
- How fast can you get here?


463
00:35:00.005 --> 00:35:01.964
Thank you so much
for coming so quickly.


464
00:35:02.048 --> 00:35:03.674
We take these matters very seriously.

465
00:35:03.758 --> 00:35:05.592
- Thank you.
- Come. Come. He's here.


466
00:35:06.011 --> 00:35:07.011
Timothy!

467
00:35:08.596 --> 00:35:09.596
No!

468
00:35:09.764 --> 00:35:11.557
Hey, who did this to you?

469
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.726
He won't give us
the names of the kids.

470
00:35:16.855 --> 00:35:18.397
What happened?

471
00:35:19.274 --> 00:35:20.399
Art project.

472
00:35:22.444 --> 00:35:23.610
Art project?

473
00:36:03.401 --> 00:36:05.319
Let's get this art project cleaned up.

474
00:36:05.403 --> 00:36:06.820
Just let me.

475
00:36:07.113 --> 00:36:08.614
- Jim...
- Timothy.


476
00:36:09.657 --> 00:36:12.367
This kind of thing happened to me
when I was your age.


477
00:36:12.494 --> 00:36:13.660
Yeah.

478
00:36:13.745 --> 00:36:15.746
And all I wanted
was for my dad to have my back,


479
00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:17.081
and he didn't.

480
00:36:17.165 --> 00:36:19.666
So here's what we're going to do.

481
00:36:20.877 --> 00:36:21.877
You're going to tell me the names

482
00:36:21.961 --> 00:36:23.420
of the boys that did this to you.

483
00:36:23.838 --> 00:36:25.005
Okay?

484
00:36:25.507 --> 00:36:27.508
And I will handle it.

485
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:47.194
Hey, boss.

486
00:36:48.863 --> 00:36:49.947
Green.

487
00:36:50.031 --> 00:36:52.950
I guess
you heard what happened.


488
00:36:53.034 --> 00:36:54.201
Yeah, they called me home.

489
00:36:54.452 --> 00:36:55.494
Yeah, me, too.

490
00:36:55.578 --> 00:36:57.037
What's going on?

491
00:36:57.705 --> 00:36:59.498
Your father's handling this.

492
00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:01.708
I didn't really mind.

493
00:37:01.876 --> 00:37:03.210
Your kid ratted my boys out.

494
00:37:03.461 --> 00:37:06.171
He didn't rat them out.
That was my fault.


495
00:37:06.422 --> 00:37:07.798
So you ratted my boys out.

496
00:37:08.508 --> 00:37:10.843
You can't let people
treat you like this. Come on.


497
00:37:11.928 --> 00:37:14.012
How long you been
at this parenting thing?


498
00:37:14.764 --> 00:37:16.974
Are you really going to
fight all his battles for him?


499
00:37:17.058 --> 00:37:18.976
You think that's wise?

500
00:37:19.519 --> 00:37:20.561
Hi!

501
00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.564
It was really important to Jim
that the Crudstaff boys


502
00:37:23.648 --> 00:37:25.649
take responsibility for
what they did to Timothy.


503
00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:27.734
- Yeah.
- And did they?


504
00:37:28.862 --> 00:37:30.154
We were having fun.

505
00:37:30.697 --> 00:37:33.073
He didn't fight back. 
He didn't even cry.

506
00:37:33.575 --> 00:37:34.741
It wasn't any fun.

507
00:37:34.826 --> 00:37:36.118
I think what the boys

508
00:37:36.202 --> 00:37:38.036
are trying to say is next Saturday

509
00:37:38.121 --> 00:37:40.080
we're having a birthday party pool bash,

510
00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.249
and we'd love it if Timothy would come.

511
00:37:42.834 --> 00:37:43.917
Yes!

512
00:37:44.335 --> 00:37:46.044
Oh, please. Don't tell me

513
00:37:46.629 --> 00:37:49.673
you took him back
to the house of the boys who bullied him.


514
00:37:49.924 --> 00:37:52.968
He really, really wanted to go.

515
00:37:53.386 --> 00:37:55.304
So you let him decide what was best.

516
00:37:56.931 --> 00:37:59.600
I thought it was time
he learned to fight his own battles.


517
00:37:59.684 --> 00:38:01.643
We just forgot to
ask if he could swim.

518
00:38:09.027 --> 00:38:10.777
Nice socks, Green!

519
00:39:27.063 --> 00:39:36.238
Happy birthday to you

520
00:39:36.406 --> 00:39:42.160
Happy birthday dear Bobby

521
00:39:42.912 --> 00:39:48.959
Happy birthday to you

522
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.135
So was it fun?

523
00:40:40.219 --> 00:40:41.511
- How did it go?
- Were they nice?


524
00:40:41.596 --> 00:40:42.804
Were you the man?

525
00:40:42.889 --> 00:40:44.681
I kicked a girl in the head.

526
00:40:44.932 --> 00:40:46.099
- What?
- Why?


527
00:40:46.434 --> 00:40:48.185
Well, she tried to pull down my socks.

528
00:40:48.269 --> 00:40:50.520
What? Did she see you?

529
00:40:50.605 --> 00:40:51.730
I don't think so.

530
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.775
Maybe.

531
00:40:55.026 --> 00:40:56.234
I'm sure she didn't see him.

532
00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:59.529
You cannot let anybody
see your leaves, honey.


533
00:40:59.614 --> 00:41:01.365
I know, but

534
00:41:01.449 --> 00:41:04.326
what do I do about the girl
I kicked in the head?


535
00:41:04.994 --> 00:41:05.994
Jim?

536
00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:10.040
Well, if you see her coming,
just run the other way.


537
00:41:11.959 --> 00:41:13.043
- Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.


538
00:41:32.146 --> 00:41:33.146
You know I saw.

539
00:41:34.232 --> 00:41:37.025
Look.

540
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.110
No.

541
00:41:38.194 --> 00:41:39.277
Just look.

542
00:41:39.362 --> 00:41:40.445
Why?

543
00:41:41.197 --> 00:41:42.239
You'll see.

544
00:41:46.327 --> 00:41:47.411
Wow.

545
00:41:48.204 --> 00:41:50.038
You're not the only one with a secret.

546
00:41:58.381 --> 00:41:59.881
You coming?

547
00:42:00.466 --> 00:42:01.508
Okay.

548
00:42:16.524 --> 00:42:18.066
It's perfect.

549
00:42:20.486 --> 00:42:21.486
Whoo!

550
00:42:21.904 --> 00:42:23.196
Look at that nest!

551
00:42:24.657 --> 00:42:26.450
I get inspired from this street, you know,

552
00:42:26.534 --> 00:42:28.118
for my sculptures and my art.

553
00:42:28.369 --> 00:42:29.327
Yeah.

554
00:42:29.412 --> 00:42:31.413
I always get inspired by nature.

555
00:42:40.631 --> 00:42:41.673
I almost forgot.

556
00:42:42.884 --> 00:42:44.926
Compliments of the Crudstaffs.

557
00:42:45.011 --> 00:42:47.137
And, please, tell your friends.

558
00:42:47.972 --> 00:42:49.347
Thanks.

559
00:43:01.235 --> 00:43:02.360
We're all working hard.

560
00:43:02.445 --> 00:43:04.404
I know. It's going to be fine.

561
00:43:04.489 --> 00:43:06.239
- Jim.
- Hey, honey.


562
00:43:06.324 --> 00:43:07.491
It's not really a good time.

563
00:43:07.575 --> 00:43:09.284
Look out your window.

564
00:43:11.579 --> 00:43:14.164
Remember when he said
he kicked a girl in the head?


565
00:43:14.248 --> 00:43:15.874
- Yeah.
- Is that her?


566
00:43:15.958 --> 00:43:18.168
Because this is too soon.
He's too young.


567
00:43:18.252 --> 00:43:20.128
You told him to run the other way

568
00:43:20.213 --> 00:43:23.089
when he saw her,
and he... He's not running!


569
00:43:50.993 --> 00:43:51.993
Whoa!

570
00:43:57.458 --> 00:43:58.625
See you.

571
00:43:58.709 --> 00:44:01.002
Yeah. See you.

572
00:44:07.552 --> 00:44:09.594
Yes! Yes! Yes!

573
00:44:40.334 --> 00:44:41.543
Timothy?

574
00:44:42.253 --> 00:44:43.461
Timothy!

575
00:44:44.422 --> 00:44:47.048
That night,
our plan was to sit Timothy down,


576
00:44:47.133 --> 00:44:49.259
just as parents. 
Go right at it.

577
00:44:49.677 --> 00:44:50.760
Right at what?

578
00:44:50.845 --> 00:44:52.721
Well, we were going to have...

579
00:44:52.805 --> 00:44:53.805
"The talk"

580
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.182
...that you have that we

581
00:44:56.267 --> 00:44:57.642
didn't really know how to have.

582
00:44:57.727 --> 00:45:00.061
That was the plan.
The talk, that night.


583
00:45:01.022 --> 00:45:02.522
- Hey, buddy.
- But then...


584
00:45:05.526 --> 00:45:06.985
What is it?

585
00:45:07.653 --> 00:45:09.529
Sweetie, it's your Uncle Bub.

586
00:45:12.158 --> 00:45:13.825
We got to go. Come on.

587
00:45:23.753 --> 00:45:25.920
- Are we too late?
- No, no.


588
00:45:26.005 --> 00:45:27.881
Bubbles is still with us.

589
00:45:30.343 --> 00:45:31.635
I brought your favorite cookies.

590
00:45:31.719 --> 00:45:34.054
If I can get them past the police,
I'll leave you one.


591
00:45:34.138 --> 00:45:35.722
At least it's not ice cream.

592
00:45:36.515 --> 00:45:40.060
Remember the year
that you started to lose your hair


593
00:45:40.144 --> 00:45:42.646
and you convinced Brenda and me

594
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.231
that if we gave you ice cream at night,
it would grow back?


595
00:45:49.195 --> 00:45:51.738
Cinderella, do you remember
that painting you made?


596
00:45:53.157 --> 00:45:54.157
No. What painting?

597
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:57.827
You know, when your mom was your age

598
00:45:57.912 --> 00:45:59.245
she was quite an artiste.

599
00:45:59.747 --> 00:46:01.373
Not really. I was not.

600
00:46:01.457 --> 00:46:03.166
Oh, she was never happier

601
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.085
than when she had
a paintbrush in her hand.


602
00:46:05.169 --> 00:46:06.586
That's right.

603
00:46:06.671 --> 00:46:10.674
She worked on this
one painting for days.


604
00:46:10.758 --> 00:46:13.718
Wouldn't let anybody see it.
Had to get it right.


605
00:46:14.428 --> 00:46:15.595
You remember that?

606
00:46:16.222 --> 00:46:17.263
No.

607
00:46:17.598 --> 00:46:19.849
It was a self-portrait.

608
00:46:21.519 --> 00:46:25.730
We didn't get it.
It was ahead of its time.


609
00:46:26.816 --> 00:46:28.274
We all laughed.

610
00:46:29.485 --> 00:46:31.194
Boy, did you cry.

611
00:46:31.696 --> 00:46:33.279
You ran away,

612
00:46:33.364 --> 00:46:37.033
and when you came back,
the picture was gone.


613
00:46:37.618 --> 00:46:39.369
You'd thrown it away.

614
00:46:39.453 --> 00:46:40.453
Oh!

615
00:46:40.538 --> 00:46:42.455
I always felt so bad about that.

616
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.623
No!

617
00:46:43.708 --> 00:46:44.708
Oh, Bub!

618
00:46:45.876 --> 00:46:47.377
We're going to
take a little break.


619
00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:49.587
Bubbles, you're going to
have a little rest.


620
00:46:51.507 --> 00:46:53.466
Let Timothy stay, huh?

621
00:46:53.843 --> 00:46:55.927
Okay. You okay?

622
00:46:56.554 --> 00:46:57.804
It's okay, Mom.

623
00:46:57.888 --> 00:46:58.930
Okay.

624
00:46:59.473 --> 00:47:00.807
We're right here.

625
00:47:04.895 --> 00:47:05.895
Hey.

626
00:47:06.313 --> 00:47:09.399
Something you want to ask me?

627
00:47:10.484 --> 00:47:13.445
Is it true you also invented the BLT?

628
00:47:17.658 --> 00:47:20.243
I mean, I would have
brought my kids if I'd known.


629
00:47:20.786 --> 00:47:22.620
- Shouldn't he be resting?
- Maybe you should get him.


630
00:47:22.913 --> 00:47:25.123
- I'm on it.
- No, let them be.


631
00:47:48.814 --> 00:47:51.191
I never thought I'd hear that laugh again.

632
00:49:20.281 --> 00:49:21.364
Next.

633
00:49:21.824 --> 00:49:25.618
After that,
we needed to get Timothy back to just...


634
00:49:25.744 --> 00:49:27.453
- Hi.
- ...being a kid.


635
00:49:29.957 --> 00:49:31.833
Coach Cal doesn't see it.

636
00:49:32.001 --> 00:49:33.293
Next.

637
00:49:34.795 --> 00:49:36.796
Help us out here, Coach.

638
00:49:36.922 --> 00:49:38.590
This would be really good for him.

639
00:49:38.674 --> 00:49:40.925
This is the best possible way for him
to make some friends.


640
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.310
Go! Go! Go! Go!

641
00:49:50.394 --> 00:49:51.728
Come on, Green. 
Let's see what you got.

642
00:49:51.812 --> 00:49:53.271
That's right.
Let's see what you got!


643
00:49:53.355 --> 00:49:54.564
Eye on the ball.

644
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.529
Oh, my gosh!

645
00:50:03.407 --> 00:50:04.574
Take the smiles off your faces.

646
00:50:04.658 --> 00:50:05.950
Is your ankle all right?

647
00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:07.702
He's good.

648
00:50:08.412 --> 00:50:09.495
Come on, Green!

649
00:50:12.082 --> 00:50:13.249
Eyes on the ball!

650
00:50:20.466 --> 00:50:21.966
Oh, dear God.

651
00:50:24.762 --> 00:50:25.929
Why are you smiling?

652
00:50:26.472 --> 00:50:27.680
I can only get better.

653
00:50:29.975 --> 00:50:33.102
Erasers, run it out!
Come on. Hustle up!


654
00:50:33.646 --> 00:50:34.771
- Green.
- Nice job.


655
00:50:35.522 --> 00:50:36.689
Run, run, run!

656
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:39.525
Don't cut any corners.

657
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:41.402
Excuse me, Coach, 
I just want to say

658
00:50:41.487 --> 00:50:42.654
that I'll be working with him

659
00:50:42.738 --> 00:50:44.030
around the clock if necessary

660
00:50:44.114 --> 00:50:45.365
just to get him to the next level.

661
00:50:45.449 --> 00:50:47.784
Oh, tell me you're not
those kind of parents.


662
00:50:47.868 --> 00:50:49.953
The type that get
over-involved, over-invested.


663
00:50:50.037 --> 00:50:52.080
We are definitely
not those kind of parents.


664
00:50:52.164 --> 00:50:54.374
Then we won't have a problem.

665
00:50:54.458 --> 00:50:56.542
- Jim.
- Come on! Run it out!


666
00:50:56.877 --> 00:50:59.587
Come on, Timothy.
Come on, run faster. Yes, yes, yes!


667
00:50:59.672 --> 00:51:00.755
Run it out, Erasers!

668
00:51:01.507 --> 00:51:02.465
What is she doing here?

669
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:03.549
I don't know.

670
00:51:03.634 --> 00:51:05.593
There are so many girls.

671
00:51:06.428 --> 00:51:07.470
Yeah, okay.

672
00:51:07.554 --> 00:51:09.347
Which means it's possible
to find the right girl.


673
00:51:09.431 --> 00:51:10.890
Use your feet. Your feet.

674
00:51:10.975 --> 00:51:13.059
What your dad wants to say but isn't

675
00:51:13.143 --> 00:51:18.106
is that it would be a mistake
to focus on just one fish


676
00:51:18.399 --> 00:51:20.650
- when there are so many...
- Fish?


677
00:51:20.734 --> 00:51:21.901
Keep your eyes on the ball.

678
00:51:21.986 --> 00:51:23.695
Use the inside of your foot. All right?

679
00:51:23.779 --> 00:51:25.196
Jim! Could you...

680
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.242
What your mom is trying to say...

681
00:51:29.326 --> 00:51:30.326
Right.

682
00:51:32.371 --> 00:51:33.413
Well...

683
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.457
- Oof!
- Okay.


684
00:51:37.084 --> 00:51:38.084
Come on.

685
00:51:39.753 --> 00:51:41.921
Listen. I know the feeling.

686
00:51:42.006 --> 00:51:43.172
You do?

687
00:51:43.257 --> 00:51:45.425
When I was about your
age, I met a girl.

688
00:51:45.509 --> 00:51:47.510
She was an original.

689
00:51:47.594 --> 00:51:49.595
Creative, artsy type.

690
00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.932
So... I know the pull.

691
00:51:53.017 --> 00:51:55.852
Jim? Where you going with this?

692
00:51:55.936 --> 00:51:57.478
What happened with the girl?

693
00:51:59.773 --> 00:52:02.150
I married her. Right.

694
00:52:02.234 --> 00:52:03.568
Not what I had in mind, but...

695
00:52:03.652 --> 00:52:04.652
It's true.

696
00:52:04.737 --> 00:52:06.821
Okay! Keep your eye on the ball,

697
00:52:06.905 --> 00:52:09.198
inside of the foot,
stay on your feet! Go!

698
00:52:10.784 --> 00:52:12.660
- Wow!
- Oh! Perfect!


699
00:52:12.745 --> 00:52:15.038
- Perfect, perfect, perfect!
- Look at that!


700
00:52:15.122 --> 00:52:16.873
It's not that
we wanted him to be perfect.


701
00:52:16.957 --> 00:52:17.999
That's what we're looking for!

702
00:52:18.083 --> 00:52:20.251
- We wanted it to be perfect.
- Let's go again.


703
00:52:21.003 --> 00:52:22.628
His childhood.

704
00:52:24.298 --> 00:52:26.591
And just when we started to
get the hang of it at home...


705
00:52:26.675 --> 00:52:29.177
Things got
complicated at the factory.


706
00:52:29.261 --> 00:52:30.803
Looking good, Brian.

707
00:52:31.305 --> 00:52:33.765
Boss wants to see you. 
In his office.

708
00:52:33.849 --> 00:52:35.141
- Now?
- Now.


709
00:52:39.021 --> 00:52:40.730
You want to see me?

710
00:52:40.814 --> 00:52:41.814
Sit.

711
00:52:45.486 --> 00:52:47.278
Heard your kid joined the Erasers.

712
00:52:47.654 --> 00:52:49.739
Yes. Yes, he did.

713
00:52:49.823 --> 00:52:52.075
Is he good? Hope he's good.

714
00:52:52.159 --> 00:52:53.367
Well...

715
00:52:56.997 --> 00:53:00.958
That's a confidential list.
First round of layoffs.


716
00:53:01.043 --> 00:53:02.085
Of course, my aunt and my father

717
00:53:02.169 --> 00:53:04.670
might decide that that's not enough.

718
00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:11.010
But these are all good,
hard-working people.


719
00:53:11.095 --> 00:53:13.471
Green, you don't decide who we let go.

720
00:53:15.182 --> 00:53:17.183
You'll just be the one to tell them.

721
00:53:26.652 --> 00:53:27.902
Night, guys.

722
00:53:30.614 --> 00:53:32.615
Oh, why couldn't
the skeleton cross the road?


723
00:53:35.994 --> 00:53:37.537
Why, sweetie?

724
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:39.080
Because it had no guts.

725
00:53:42.084 --> 00:53:43.793
Ooh! I got another one.

726
00:53:43.877 --> 00:53:44.877
Buddy.

727
00:53:45.212 --> 00:53:46.712
Not tonight.

728
00:53:49.216 --> 00:53:50.842
If you will excuse me.

729
00:54:05.774 --> 00:54:06.774
Dad?

730
00:54:10.487 --> 00:54:13.656
That Halloween,
your mom went as a pencil.


731
00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.324
- A blue pencil.
- Mmm-hmm.


732
00:54:16.076 --> 00:54:17.076
Hmm.

733
00:54:17.661 --> 00:54:19.370
- It was a good costume.
- It was.


734
00:54:19.454 --> 00:54:21.080
My head was the eraser.

735
00:54:23.417 --> 00:54:24.917
I had seen a lot of pencils,

736
00:54:25.335 --> 00:54:27.670
but I had never seen
one quite like your mom.


737
00:54:27.754 --> 00:54:28.754
Breathtaking.

738
00:54:29.423 --> 00:54:32.091
But I was too scared
to even talk to her,

739
00:54:32.176 --> 00:54:34.427
so I wrote her a note.

740
00:54:35.179 --> 00:54:36.220
Yeah.

741
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:38.890
- What did it say?
- It said...


742
00:54:39.933 --> 00:54:43.394
"It feels to me that with a pencil

743
00:54:44.688 --> 00:54:46.105
"anything is possible."

744
00:54:47.107 --> 00:54:48.816
That is so true.

745
00:54:49.776 --> 00:54:52.361
Hey. Pass me that book. Yeah.

746
00:54:53.739 --> 00:54:54.780
All of these...

747
00:54:56.283 --> 00:54:58.826
All of these notebooks from that day,

748
00:55:00.454 --> 00:55:02.788
I just filled them with ideas

749
00:55:04.166 --> 00:55:06.167
of things that I wanted to make.

750
00:55:07.127 --> 00:55:11.756
Because I thought
to be a part of making something,


751
00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.841
that was a great feeling.

752
00:55:17.804 --> 00:55:20.598
God, to think that
we may not be making these anymore.


753
00:55:22.726 --> 00:55:24.810
Why not make a new kind of pencil?

754
00:55:28.607 --> 00:55:30.816
- That's easier said than done.
- Yeah.


755
00:55:31.652 --> 00:55:34.487
Well, you can design it

756
00:55:36.114 --> 00:55:37.782
and you can draw it.

757
00:55:38.325 --> 00:55:40.159
Then you guys can both build it.

758
00:55:41.328 --> 00:55:43.037
I want to write a note to Joni.

759
00:55:44.331 --> 00:55:45.623
Good night.

760
00:55:49.086 --> 00:55:51.128
How do you tell your child
something's not possible?


761
00:55:51.213 --> 00:55:52.463
That it can't be done.

762
00:55:52.547 --> 00:55:54.799
When they believe in you like that.

763
00:55:54.883 --> 00:55:56.008
We didn't want to disappoint him.

764
00:55:56.093 --> 00:55:57.301
No. We got busy.

765
00:55:57.386 --> 00:55:59.220
Not that we thought
that we could do it.


766
00:55:59.304 --> 00:56:00.846
At least Timothy
would know that we tried.


767
00:56:00.931 --> 00:56:02.139
Yeah. We stayed up
all that first night.


768
00:56:02.224 --> 00:56:04.267
We stayed up
several nights after that.


769
00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:05.476
Cindy started making sketches.

770
00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.811
Jim started carving.

771
00:56:07.521 --> 00:56:10.690
It turns out we weren't
the only ones making something.


772
00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:14.860
Yeah. We both came up
with the idea to use leaves.


773
00:56:14.945 --> 00:56:15.945
Leaves.

774
00:56:19.199 --> 00:56:22.285
See? Nowjust wind it.
The other way. Yeah. You got it.


775
00:56:26.331 --> 00:56:28.040
Just a little more.

776
00:56:28.292 --> 00:56:30.251
Yeah, see?
Just put it right through.


777
00:56:30.335 --> 00:56:32.211
- Like this?
- That's good.


778
00:56:34.131 --> 00:56:36.007
So we've got
our leaf slurry pretty much ready.


779
00:56:36.133 --> 00:56:38.342
Okay. Right on in.

780
00:56:40.387 --> 00:56:41.887
- Perfect.
- That should do it.


781
00:56:42.139 --> 00:56:44.890
Let's see. Help it... 
Help it push it down.

782
00:56:45.142 --> 00:56:47.310
Okay.

783
00:56:47.394 --> 00:56:48.811
Oh, yeah!

784
00:56:52.691 --> 00:56:53.733
Okay.

785
00:56:54.484 --> 00:56:56.360
Ta-da!

786
00:56:56.445 --> 00:56:59.697
Oh, my gosh!
This is the pencil. You really did it.


787
00:56:59.781 --> 00:57:01.157
- We did.
- You made it.


788
00:57:01.241 --> 00:57:04.660
So we're to believe
that you made a pencil out of leaves?


789
00:57:05.078 --> 00:57:07.204
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, it was a prototype.


790
00:57:07.289 --> 00:57:10.207
You do realize if any part of
your story doesn't check out,


791
00:57:10.292 --> 00:57:11.709
we are done here.

792
00:57:11.793 --> 00:57:14.337
And we will be
checking it out. Thoroughly.


793
00:57:14.421 --> 00:57:15.546
- And you should.
- Well, good.


794
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:19.842
Anyway, that Monday
was take your kid to work day.


795
00:57:20.594 --> 00:57:21.594
He started with me.

796
00:57:22.387 --> 00:57:25.139
It was kind of
a celebratory day at work and...


797
00:57:27.851 --> 00:57:29.393
Timothy wanted to be in on it.

798
00:57:29.478 --> 00:57:30.936
Something's missing.

799
00:57:31.063 --> 00:57:33.564
Oh, nonsense. It's you. So...

800
00:57:34.107 --> 00:57:35.274
Very you.

801
00:57:35.609 --> 00:57:36.901
Gentlemen.

802
00:57:38.987 --> 00:57:41.072
And as soon
as he met my boss,


803
00:57:41.198 --> 00:57:43.157
he didn't know to be intimidated by her,

804
00:57:43.241 --> 00:57:44.784
and the next thing you know...

805
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:46.911
Little man, what do you think of that?

806
00:57:47.537 --> 00:57:48.788
Not much.

807
00:57:48.872 --> 00:57:50.664
Well, that's honest.

808
00:57:50.749 --> 00:57:51.791
Timothy's very honest, ma'am.

809
00:57:51.875 --> 00:57:56.045
That was done by a renowned artist
at great expense.


810
00:57:56.129 --> 00:57:57.797
I would have done it for free.

811
00:57:59.132 --> 00:58:01.300
Are you suggesting
you could do it better?


812
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:03.177
I can try.

813
00:58:04.554 --> 00:58:06.555
Well, let's find out.

814
00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:10.935
May I just remind you,
ma'am, as his parent,


815
00:58:11.019 --> 00:58:12.061
that he is only ten years old, and...

816
00:58:12.145 --> 00:58:13.479
Don't you have somewhere to be?

817
00:58:13.563 --> 00:58:14.855
Of course I do, but...

818
00:58:15.816 --> 00:58:16.982
- Shoo.
- Okay.


819
00:59:31.725 --> 00:59:32.725
Oh!

820
00:59:35.103 --> 00:59:36.896
Oh, sweetie.

821
00:59:37.814 --> 00:59:40.649
Oh, it's beautiful. It's amazing.

822
00:59:40.775 --> 00:59:42.067
It's amazing.

823
00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.113
Oh, no, no, no.
Erase that.


824
00:59:46.364 --> 00:59:47.698
Why?

825
00:59:49.242 --> 00:59:53.871
It turns out, Timothy
was Picasso with a pencil.


826
00:59:53.955 --> 00:59:56.248
So he had
all the qualities you imagined?


827
00:59:56.416 --> 00:59:57.416
Oh, yes.

828
00:59:57.667 --> 01:00:00.794
Yeah, well,
including honest to a fault.


829
01:00:13.099 --> 01:00:15.351
He couldn't help
but draw her exactly as he saw her.


830
01:00:15.435 --> 01:00:16.519
Yeah.

831
01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.855
It included an unfortunate
thatch of chin hair.


832
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:20.940
Mmm.

833
01:00:27.197 --> 01:00:30.658
So, what else aren't you telling me?

834
01:00:32.911 --> 01:00:33.953
Tell her.

835
01:00:34.371 --> 01:00:35.746
Hmm?

836
01:00:35.956 --> 01:00:37.081
I'm waiting.

837
01:00:37.749 --> 01:00:40.042
Sometimes you wear
plaids and stripes that clash.


838
01:00:40.794 --> 01:00:42.127
Hmm.

839
01:00:42.337 --> 01:00:45.089
Your one joke that
you always tell, it's not funny.


840
01:00:46.383 --> 01:00:48.884
No one can appreciate the art in here

841
01:00:48.969 --> 01:00:50.678
because everything
that is special and beautiful,


842
01:00:50.762 --> 01:00:52.263
no one can see
because the curtains are so thick


843
01:00:52.347 --> 01:00:54.348
that the light can't get in.

844
01:00:54.432 --> 01:00:56.850
Not to mention, if someone has a child

845
01:00:56.935 --> 01:00:59.895
who just is born or appears,

846
01:01:00.272 --> 01:01:02.314
say congratulations with a smile.

847
01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.316
Say something nice.

848
01:01:04.985 --> 01:01:06.235
I wanted to love you,

849
01:01:06.319 --> 01:01:07.903
and I have tried
so hard to like you.

850
01:01:07.988 --> 01:01:10.823
But if someone asked me to be
a pallbearer at your funeral,


851
01:01:10.907 --> 01:01:14.326
I would tell them not by
the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.


852
01:01:14.869 --> 01:01:15.995
And furthermore...

853
01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:18.122
- Cindy lost herjob.
- I lost my job.


854
01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:23.836
I didn't regret most of what I said.

855
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:26.213
But you lost yourjob.

856
01:01:28.216 --> 01:01:29.758
Make sure all the pencils are good.

857
01:01:29.843 --> 01:01:31.719
So things were going to get harder.

858
01:01:31.803 --> 01:01:33.512
But at least I still had myjob.

859
01:01:33.763 --> 01:01:34.972
Yes, he did.

860
01:01:35.473 --> 01:01:38.183
They go in this box.
They go on a little pencil vacation.


861
01:01:38.268 --> 01:01:39.310
And what did you say about

862
01:01:39.394 --> 01:01:41.103
having Timothy with you that day?

863
01:01:41.187 --> 01:01:43.022
- Oh, right.
- That's a lot of trees.


864
01:01:43.773 --> 01:01:45.065
I couldn't help but feel...

865
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:46.191
Mind if I have one?

866
01:01:46.359 --> 01:01:47.484
...anything was possible.

867
01:01:47.819 --> 01:01:49.194
You want another one?
You want a yellow one?


868
01:01:49.279 --> 01:01:51.155
We got this... 
You see, we got a whole...

869
01:01:51.239 --> 01:01:53.157
- Right back.
- Good luck, Dad.


870
01:01:53.533 --> 01:01:55.826
So Jim gave it his best shot.

871
01:01:55.952 --> 01:01:57.828
Sir? How you doing?

872
01:01:59.456 --> 01:02:00.831
- Huh?
- Do you have a minute?


873
01:02:01.207 --> 01:02:02.207
No.

874
01:02:04.044 --> 01:02:07.212
Oh, hell. Why not?
Turns out we may all get the axe.


875
01:02:08.381 --> 01:02:09.381
What?

876
01:02:09.466 --> 01:02:11.383
Then I think we got nothing to lose.

877
01:02:11.468 --> 01:02:14.303
What if we made
a new kind of pencil?

878
01:02:46.461 --> 01:02:49.338
Come on, Erasers!
Come on! Come on!


879
01:02:49.422 --> 01:02:52.007
Push up the field! 
Push up the field!

880
01:02:52.092 --> 01:02:55.469
Don't pass it!
How do you score if you pass it!


881
01:02:56.262 --> 01:02:58.597
Kick it! Kick the ball!

882
01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.016
- Mom! I'm so thirsty.
- What are you doing?


883
01:03:01.184 --> 01:03:03.560
No, no, no. Get back
on D. Back on D!

884
01:03:06.981 --> 01:03:08.065
Come on!

885
01:03:09.484 --> 01:03:12.986
I saw your car.
Didn't know the kid was a player.


886
01:03:13.071 --> 01:03:14.363
What position? Striker?

887
01:03:14.447 --> 01:03:15.489
Uh...

888
01:03:15.573 --> 01:03:18.409
Well, he's taking a break right now.

889
01:03:18.493 --> 01:03:20.953
Oh, well, I got time.

890
01:03:21.955 --> 01:03:23.205
It might be a while.

891
01:03:25.208 --> 01:03:26.917
You know, I'm impressed, Dad.

892
01:03:27.544 --> 01:03:29.128
You never really came to my games.

893
01:03:29.295 --> 01:03:33.132
No. I came.
You were always on the bench.


894
01:03:33.967 --> 01:03:37.428
Come on, Luke.
Find your man. Find your man!


895
01:03:37.637 --> 01:03:38.971
You got to want it!

896
01:03:39.055 --> 01:03:40.180
Oh, here we go.

897
01:03:40.306 --> 01:03:42.057
Come on, I want to see some fight!

898
01:03:42.183 --> 01:03:43.559
To keep you hydrated, sir.

899
01:03:45.019 --> 01:03:46.103
Thank you.

900
01:03:48.398 --> 01:03:49.857
He's a water boy.

901
01:03:51.067 --> 01:03:52.192
No. Dad,

902
01:03:52.277 --> 01:03:55.279
actually, I'm working
on all aspects of his game right now.


903
01:03:57.157 --> 01:03:58.323
And you know what...

904
01:03:58.491 --> 01:04:01.118
Come on, Erasers.
Keep your head in the game.


905
01:04:01.202 --> 01:04:02.327
Let's go, Bobby! Let's go!

906
01:04:02.412 --> 01:04:03.912
Good pass. Good pass.

907
01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:09.251
- All right.
- Yeah. Yeah.


908
01:04:10.003 --> 01:04:11.336
Good eye! Good eye!

909
01:04:11.421 --> 01:04:12.671
Talk to each other!

910
01:04:12.922 --> 01:04:15.424
Erasers, talk to each other!

911
01:04:15.508 --> 01:04:17.926
That's your house, Philip!

912
01:04:18.011 --> 01:04:19.636
Don't let nothing in there!
That's your house!


913
01:04:19.763 --> 01:04:20.637
That's your house!

914
01:04:27.479 --> 01:04:29.521
All this time, it felt like

915
01:04:29.606 --> 01:04:32.191
there was something
Timothy wasn't telling us.


916
01:04:41.326 --> 01:04:44.119
And he was spending
far too much time with that girl.


917
01:04:44.204 --> 01:04:45.954
Was it a problem for you?

918
01:04:47.707 --> 01:04:49.416
Well,
they were up to something,


919
01:04:49.501 --> 01:04:50.459
and we didn't know what.

920
01:04:52.337 --> 01:04:54.296
Can you teach me to do that thing?

921
01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.964
You know, that you do with your arms

922
01:04:56.049 --> 01:04:57.633
and you put your
head up in the sun.

923
01:04:57.717 --> 01:04:59.051
Well, first, find the light, all right?

924
01:04:59.135 --> 01:05:00.135
Okay.

925
01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:04.973
Just absorb it.
Just soak it in. Think "tree."


926
01:05:06.476 --> 01:05:08.268
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, I feel it.


927
01:05:09.395 --> 01:05:10.479
Nice.

928
01:05:12.023 --> 01:05:13.607
Maybe you should show your birthmark,

929
01:05:13.691 --> 01:05:15.275
because people might like it.

930
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360
I don't know.

931
01:05:16.444 --> 01:05:19.238
We didn't know
what he was doing with the girl.


932
01:05:19.322 --> 01:05:20.906
It was fine if he
wanted to have a secret

933
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:23.075
as long as he shared it with us.

934
01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:27.538
So Cindy did
what she thought was best.


935
01:05:36.923 --> 01:05:39.967
Hey!

936
01:05:44.013 --> 01:05:45.097
We need to talk.

937
01:05:45.181 --> 01:05:46.473
Okay, let's talk.

938
01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.725
Well, can you wait?

939
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:51.395
Fine.

940
01:05:54.607 --> 01:05:58.777
I don't think that
you're the best influence on my son,


941
01:05:59.028 --> 01:06:01.029
and I want you
to tell me what you know about him.


942
01:06:01.114 --> 01:06:02.281
I know a lot.

943
01:06:02.365 --> 01:06:03.490
I thought so.

944
01:06:04.284 --> 01:06:05.701
So you know that he's got...

945
01:06:07.704 --> 01:06:09.246
You know that he's different.

946
01:06:09.372 --> 01:06:11.707
Yeah. It's what I like about him.

947
01:06:13.501 --> 01:06:15.294
Well, it's a hard
world to be different in.

948
01:06:16.421 --> 01:06:17.796
And I don't want him to be hurt.

949
01:06:18.256 --> 01:06:20.257
By you or anyone. 
I won't let it happen.

950
01:06:20.383 --> 01:06:21.466
That's good.

951
01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.178
What is this?

952
01:06:26.431 --> 01:06:28.307
He's going to be misunderstood.

953
01:06:29.767 --> 01:06:31.768
Lots of people hate anything different.

954
01:06:33.688 --> 01:06:35.355
I wish it wasn't this way, but

955
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:38.609
I wish a lot of things. I wish...

956
01:06:52.749 --> 01:06:56.668
It took my breath away,
this world they created.


957
01:06:59.631 --> 01:07:01.089
I was wrong

958
01:07:01.633 --> 01:07:04.593
about this, this girl.

959
01:07:16.189 --> 01:07:17.481
You did this?

960
01:07:17.607 --> 01:07:20.317
Yeah. Timothy and I did it together.

961
01:07:21.361 --> 01:07:22.444
I had made a mistake.

962
01:07:22.528 --> 01:07:23.612
We made lots of mistakes.

963
01:07:23.696 --> 01:07:26.698
Yeah, we made mistakes
trying to fix our mistakes.


964
01:07:26.783 --> 01:07:28.533
Isn't that how you know you're a parent?

965
01:07:32.372 --> 01:07:34.414
You seem to forget
what the object is here.


966
01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.333
You need to persuade us.

967
01:07:36.417 --> 01:07:38.710
Tell me, what would you do differently?

968
01:07:40.463 --> 01:07:41.880
We'd make better mistakes?

969
01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:43.548
- Better?
- Different. New.


970
01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:44.758
New mistakes.

971
01:07:44.842 --> 01:07:47.135
That's... That's what we'd do.

972
01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.303
Yeah.

973
01:07:49.472 --> 01:07:51.723
Put your
heart into it, Erasers!


974
01:07:52.892 --> 01:07:54.309
Smarten up out there.

975
01:07:54.394 --> 01:07:55.560
Bobby.

976
01:07:57.397 --> 01:07:58.605
The most amazing thing happened.

977
01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:00.816
I woke up this morning
and I started to draw again.


978
01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.485
Oh, God! It must be so nice to
have time to waste.


979
01:08:03.569 --> 01:08:04.569
It was like coming home.

980
01:08:04.654 --> 01:08:07.155
My three are so busy with
their second languages,


981
01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.240
their public service work...

982
01:08:08.324 --> 01:08:09.866
Oh, and their upcoming music recital.

983
01:08:09.951 --> 01:08:11.660
Your presence is expected.

984
01:08:11.744 --> 01:08:14.830
Let's go, Erasers! Come on!

985
01:08:17.834 --> 01:08:19.543
Brenda's freaking me out.

986
01:08:21.671 --> 01:08:22.921
What's wrong?

987
01:08:24.841 --> 01:08:26.591
If you're on the bench now,

988
01:08:26.968 --> 01:08:29.386
you'll be on the
bench of life later on.

989
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:31.388
Jim, that is your father talking.

990
01:08:31.514 --> 01:08:32.889
Coach. Coach!

991
01:08:33.391 --> 01:08:34.850
Put Green in!

992
01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.685
Come on.

993
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:38.395
Good, Coach. Thank you.

994
01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:39.688
What are you doing? No, no, no. Jim...

995
01:08:39.772 --> 01:08:40.814
Put...

996
01:08:42.608 --> 01:08:43.775
What's going on?

997
01:08:44.777 --> 01:08:46.862
Oh, great.
Now he's going to do that again.


998
01:08:46.946 --> 01:08:48.363
What?

999
01:08:48.448 --> 01:08:51.199
He's going to uncross his arms,
crack his knuckles,


1000
01:08:51.284 --> 01:08:52.409
then he will turn and go.

1001
01:08:52.493 --> 01:08:53.535
Yep.

1002
01:08:53.619 --> 01:08:55.328
It's fine that he did that to me,

1003
01:08:55.413 --> 01:08:56.788
but now he's doing it to Timothy.

1004
01:08:57.331 --> 01:08:58.457
Hey, Jim...

1005
01:08:58.624 --> 01:09:00.417
Look. Look.

1006
01:09:03.546 --> 01:09:04.713
Here, Grandpa Jim.

1007
01:09:05.798 --> 01:09:07.716
You know
what I feel really good about?


1008
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.760
Bart and I are just grateful
that our kids' school


1009
01:09:09.844 --> 01:09:11.636
has a gifted and talented program.

1010
01:09:12.513 --> 01:09:13.889
Did you know Timothy is gifted?

1011
01:09:13.973 --> 01:09:15.307
How so?

1012
01:09:15.808 --> 01:09:16.850
Well...

1013
01:09:17.977 --> 01:09:19.978
He always finds the bright side.

1014
01:09:20.313 --> 01:09:22.814
He never gives up
and he has a good heart.


1015
01:09:22.982 --> 01:09:24.858
That will get you into college.

1016
01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:29.529
- He's a great artist.
- Look where that got you.


1017
01:09:29.614 --> 01:09:30.697
Get open!

1018
01:09:30.823 --> 01:09:33.575
Brenda, I have to say, I am...

1019
01:09:33.659 --> 01:09:34.951
What? I'm listening.

1020
01:09:35.912 --> 01:09:36.995
He's musical.

1021
01:09:38.831 --> 01:09:40.332
- Really?
- Yeah.


1022
01:09:41.501 --> 01:09:42.876
What instruments does he play?

1023
01:09:45.963 --> 01:09:48.507
"He's musical?"
What possessed you to even say that?


1024
01:09:48.674 --> 01:09:50.592
She just kept bragging
about how her kids could do this,


1025
01:09:50.676 --> 01:09:51.718
her kids could do that.

1026
01:09:51.803 --> 01:09:54.763
So Cindy's sister
has this yearly family concert


1027
01:09:54.847 --> 01:09:56.348
that we never seem to miss.

1028
01:09:56.432 --> 01:09:58.600
If I'd known
what she was going to pull that day,


1029
01:09:58.684 --> 01:09:59.684
we never would have shown up.

1030
01:10:15.034 --> 01:10:17.536
Thank you. Thank you.

1031
01:10:18.371 --> 01:10:19.412
Brilliant.

1032
01:10:19.539 --> 01:10:22.833
Thank you. This year
we are going to dispense


1033
01:10:22.917 --> 01:10:24.793
with our traditional encore.

1034
01:10:24.877 --> 01:10:25.919
Oh!

1035
01:10:26.045 --> 01:10:29.756
Because we have a very special treat.

1036
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:35.053
Sit back and enjoy
the musical stylings of Timothy Green!


1037
01:10:35.763 --> 01:10:37.889
You know what?
We're running late to something.


1038
01:10:37.974 --> 01:10:39.391
Go ahead and do the encore because...

1039
01:10:39.517 --> 01:10:41.726
No, Mom, it's okay. It's fine, Mom.

1040
01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.020
Um, Timothy?

1041
01:10:44.105 --> 01:10:45.438
- Hey, pal.
- Hey.


1042
01:10:45.523 --> 01:10:46.565
It's okay.

1043
01:11:02.707 --> 01:11:04.666
Just get him, baby. Just go.

1044
01:11:05.543 --> 01:11:06.835
Just get him. Get him.

1045
01:11:08.588 --> 01:11:09.713
Just go get him.

1046
01:11:09.797 --> 01:11:11.089
Hey, pal?

1047
01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:38.867
All my friends know the low rider

1048
01:11:41.787 --> 01:11:45.790
The low rider is a little higher

1049
01:12:09.815 --> 01:12:10.982
Yeah!

1050
01:12:22.036 --> 01:12:23.036
Yeah!

1051
01:12:23.454 --> 01:12:24.746
Can we go back and do it again?

1052
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:25.956
No.

1053
01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.582
I don't think we'll be invited back.

1054
01:12:27.667 --> 01:12:29.751
But it doesn't matter
because you were great.


1055
01:12:29.835 --> 01:12:30.919
You rock, buddy.

1056
01:12:31.003 --> 01:12:32.754
It felt great to rock.

1057
01:12:32.838 --> 01:12:34.839
It felt great to
have a kid who rocked.

1058
01:12:35.925 --> 01:12:37.133
- Good night.
- Good night.


1059
01:12:37.927 --> 01:12:39.219
It was all you.

1060
01:12:39.512 --> 01:12:40.887
And us, but mostly you.

1061
01:12:41.013 --> 01:12:42.055
Hey.

1062
01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:46.643
- We were proud of you.
- Mmm-hmm.


1063
01:12:46.936 --> 01:12:49.688
Turn the lights off in five, okay?

1064
01:12:50.523 --> 01:12:51.731
Good night!

1065
01:12:56.696 --> 01:12:57.696
We rocked!

1066
01:12:57.822 --> 01:12:58.780
We did.

1067
01:12:58.864 --> 01:12:59.864
We rocked!

1068
01:12:59.949 --> 01:13:01.074
You know what this means?

1069
01:13:01.158 --> 01:13:02.617
I think I do!

1070
01:13:03.202 --> 01:13:05.662
This Sunday at the championship game

1071
01:13:05.746 --> 01:13:09.499
our son is going to
score the winning goal.


1072
01:13:34.066 --> 01:13:35.567
Whoo! Let's go!

1073
01:13:37.278 --> 01:13:39.988
Ha! Yeah! Let's go!

1074
01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.243
All right, way to go, Coach!

1075
01:13:48.372 --> 01:13:49.414
No! No!

1076
01:13:49.498 --> 01:13:52.083
No, no, no. No, you don't! 
Not this time!

1077
01:13:52.543 --> 01:13:54.544
- You are staying for this one!
- I can't stay.


1078
01:13:54.628 --> 01:13:56.171
- You're staying.
- I got lots, I got a lot...


1079
01:13:56.255 --> 01:13:57.797
You will not be sorry!

1080
01:13:59.842 --> 01:14:01.092
I promise you.

1081
01:14:03.262 --> 01:14:05.013
- Okay.
- All right. Come on! Come on!


1082
01:14:06.015 --> 01:14:07.098
Yes!

1083
01:14:10.603 --> 01:14:13.021
Hey, Jim, how's he going to
score the winning goal


1084
01:14:13.105 --> 01:14:14.856
if he's never in the game?

1085
01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.066
Good point.

1086
01:14:17.818 --> 01:14:20.862
Hey, Coach. Coach, I just want
to give you the heads-up.


1087
01:14:20.946 --> 01:14:23.656
Timothy Green is
your difference-maker today.


1088
01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:25.158
That is your game-changer right there.

1089
01:14:25.242 --> 01:14:26.826
You're kidding, right?

1090
01:14:26.911 --> 01:14:28.244
Do I look like I'm kidding?

1091
01:14:28.329 --> 01:14:29.871
If I put your son in the game,

1092
01:14:29.955 --> 01:14:31.539
he wouldn't live to see his next birthday.

1093
01:14:31.624 --> 01:14:33.208
If you don't mind, we
got a game to win.

1094
01:14:33.292 --> 01:14:35.919
Erasers, this is our time.
This is our time.


1095
01:14:36.003 --> 01:14:37.754
Warm him up, Coach!

1096
01:14:37.838 --> 01:14:39.839
Come on, Timothy!
Let's see you run some drills.


1097
01:14:39.924 --> 01:14:41.800
How about he runs some drills, Coach?

1098
01:14:42.843 --> 01:14:44.135
You better stretch, baby!

1099
01:14:44.678 --> 01:14:46.012
What did he say?

1100
01:14:46.138 --> 01:14:48.598
- He's going to play.
- Is he going to do it?


1101
01:14:51.894 --> 01:14:53.978
Get open! Get open!
That's yours right there!


1102
01:14:54.063 --> 01:14:56.606
There you go, son. 
There you go, son.

1103
01:14:59.318 --> 01:15:02.987
All right, Erasers!
Bring the championship home!


1104
01:15:10.204 --> 01:15:11.663
Spread out!

1105
01:15:33.352 --> 01:15:34.853
- Yes!
- Oh!


1106
01:15:34.937 --> 01:15:36.020
- No! Jim!
- No!


1107
01:15:36.939 --> 01:15:38.189
Is he okay?

1108
01:15:39.024 --> 01:15:40.316
I hope he's okay.

1109
01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.694
Oh, no!

1110
01:15:43.154 --> 01:15:44.320
Time! Time!

1111
01:15:46.031 --> 01:15:47.323
It's going to be okay.

1112
01:15:48.868 --> 01:15:50.618
- Who's that?
- I have no idea.


1113
01:15:50.703 --> 01:15:52.203
- Is that the Henderson kid?
- Maybe.


1114
01:15:52.913 --> 01:15:53.997
He's not that good.

1115
01:15:55.916 --> 01:15:56.916
He's okay!

1116
01:15:57.209 --> 01:15:59.752
He's okay! It's okay.

1117
01:16:03.716 --> 01:16:05.175
I can get you some water.

1118
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:07.844
- Way to go.
- Okay.


1119
01:16:11.223 --> 01:16:12.765
- Watch this.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


1120
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:13.892
This is what we've been waiting for.

1121
01:16:13.976 --> 01:16:14.976
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1122
01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.103
- He's coming in.
- We're going with ten.


1123
01:16:17.313 --> 01:16:18.813
- Okay, Coach.
- What?


1124
01:16:18.898 --> 01:16:20.732
No, no. Ref, come here.

1125
01:16:21.442 --> 01:16:23.151
They've only got ten kids on the field.

1126
01:16:23.235 --> 01:16:25.028
What about zero?
Why isn't zero playing?


1127
01:16:25.112 --> 01:16:26.446
- I thought he was a mascot.
- No.


1128
01:16:26.655 --> 01:16:28.114
No, he's on the team.

1129
01:16:29.116 --> 01:16:30.825
There's got to be a rule.

1130
01:16:31.702 --> 01:16:34.329
Get the book.
Hundred fifty-four rule or whatever.


1131
01:16:34.455 --> 01:16:35.914
Jim, is there a rule?

1132
01:16:37.917 --> 01:16:38.958
Coach, you need 11 players on the field.

1133
01:16:39.043 --> 01:16:40.001
He doesn't play.

1134
01:16:40.085 --> 01:16:41.085
Is he on your team?

1135
01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:42.170
Yeah, he's on the team, but...

1136
01:16:42.254 --> 01:16:44.088
Then he plays. Let's go, Coach.

1137
01:16:51.096 --> 01:16:53.389
Okay, Green, come on. Come on.

1138
01:17:01.023 --> 01:17:03.107
Our son's going to
score the winning goal.


1139
01:17:05.194 --> 01:17:08.446
I want you to plant your feet
right here, son. Okay?


1140
01:17:09.156 --> 01:17:11.241
And whatever you do,
don't move from this spot.


1141
01:17:11.325 --> 01:17:12.325
You're safe here, okay?

1142
01:17:12.409 --> 01:17:13.952
- Got it, Coach.
- All right. There you go.


1143
01:17:14.036 --> 01:17:15.161
Coach, let's go.

1144
01:17:15.246 --> 01:17:16.829
All right, buddy. 
This is what it's about!

1145
01:17:17.831 --> 01:17:19.499
This is where you
find out who you are.

1146
01:17:21.752 --> 01:17:23.836
No more bench of life.

1147
01:17:23.963 --> 01:17:25.421
Oh, hit me with a stick.

1148
01:17:25.506 --> 01:17:27.048
They're not putting that boy in!

1149
01:17:27.132 --> 01:17:30.176
Actually, they are. It's good. Trust me.

1150
01:17:30.469 --> 01:17:32.136
Laugh if you want.

1151
01:17:32.221 --> 01:17:34.138
My kid is going to
score the winning goal.


1152
01:17:36.058 --> 01:17:37.809
Two minutes left in the game.

1153
01:17:37.893 --> 01:17:39.143
Who's your daddy?

1154
01:17:40.104 --> 01:17:41.187
Has he been drinking?

1155
01:17:41.272 --> 01:17:43.356
No, no. He just knows what's coming.

1156
01:17:44.358 --> 01:17:45.775
Come on, Timothy!

1157
01:17:46.193 --> 01:17:48.027
Do that thing you're going to do!

1158
01:17:49.488 --> 01:17:50.822
This is it. Come on!

1159
01:17:51.490 --> 01:17:52.991
Come on,
Erasers, let's go!


1160
01:17:53.075 --> 01:17:54.867
You can do it! 
You can do it!

1161
01:17:54.994 --> 01:17:57.203
Let's go! Let me see
some fight, Erasers!


1162
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.247
Put some heart into it!

1163
01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:02.500
That's what I'm talking about, Green.

1164
01:18:02.835 --> 01:18:04.836
That's what
I'm talking about. Keep that up.


1165
01:18:05.045 --> 01:18:06.170
Timothy. Timothy.

1166
01:18:07.339 --> 01:18:08.464
You got to move your feet. Come on.

1167
01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:10.883
No. Stay right there, son.

1168
01:18:11.010 --> 01:18:12.885
- Stay right there.
- Don't listen to Coach Cal!


1169
01:18:13.012 --> 01:18:14.304
Don't listen to your father!

1170
01:18:14.388 --> 01:18:16.264
Timothy, Timothy.
Look at me. Don't listen to Coach Cal.


1171
01:18:16.348 --> 01:18:17.932
Move your feet. Move around!

1172
01:18:18.142 --> 01:18:20.560
Green, Green. Stay right there.
You're doing great!


1173
01:18:20.853 --> 01:18:21.894
Feel it out, Timothy!

1174
01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:23.354
Come on, move around!

1175
01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.857
Chase the ball! Come on!

1176
01:18:27.192 --> 01:18:29.861
Way to go. Way to
go. Way to go, Tim.

1177
01:18:53.302 --> 01:18:54.510
God, he's doing that thing again.

1178
01:18:54.595 --> 01:18:57.138
No, no. Put your arms down. Arms down.

1179
01:18:57.222 --> 01:18:58.348
Get your head in the game, baby!

1180
01:18:58.432 --> 01:18:59.432
Get your head in the game.

1181
01:18:59.516 --> 01:19:01.100
Get in the game!

1182
01:19:01.185 --> 01:19:03.269
Like we worked it, come on!

1183
01:19:25.626 --> 01:19:27.502
There you go, Erasers,
there you go!


1184
01:19:27.628 --> 01:19:28.961
Yes! Yes!

1185
01:19:29.046 --> 01:19:30.588
There it is! There it is!

1186
01:19:30.881 --> 01:19:32.173
Get back in! Get back in!

1187
01:19:34.093 --> 01:19:35.593
- Oh, my boy! This is it!
- This is your moment!


1188
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.595
No, no, no! Don't do that!

1189
01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.473
Do something with it! Do something!

1190
01:19:43.936 --> 01:19:45.103
- Yes! Yes!
- Come on!


1191
01:19:45.437 --> 01:19:46.437
Yes!

1192
01:19:46.522 --> 01:19:47.897
That's what we're talking about.

1193
01:19:51.193 --> 01:19:54.195
All right, Green!
Come on! That's your house!


1194
01:19:56.949 --> 01:19:58.491
Just like we practiced!

1195
01:19:59.493 --> 01:20:01.077
Look at his little legs!

1196
01:20:01.161 --> 01:20:02.245
I don't believe it.

1197
01:20:02.329 --> 01:20:03.621
Oh, believe it, sister.

1198
01:20:03.914 --> 01:20:06.582
For years I've been listening to
how perfect your kids are!


1199
01:20:06.667 --> 01:20:09.168
Well, look at that! 
That kid is mine!

1200
01:20:10.212 --> 01:20:12.004
I am the mom of that!

1201
01:20:13.382 --> 01:20:15.466
Get that kid! Put him on the ground!

1202
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.553
Take his knees out!
Put him on the ground!


1203
01:20:21.056 --> 01:20:23.391
See? See?

1204
01:20:23.475 --> 01:20:25.476
See what happens
when you're there for your kid!


1205
01:20:25.561 --> 01:20:27.353
Huh? See what happens
when you believe in him! Huh?


1206
01:20:27.438 --> 01:20:31.023
I could have been like that,
because I had skills, but no.


1207
01:20:31.108 --> 01:20:33.568
Come on, Timothy! Go! Go!

1208
01:20:33.652 --> 01:20:35.069
Go, Timothy! Go!

1209
01:20:53.005 --> 01:20:54.088
No!

1210
01:20:57.342 --> 01:20:58.676
That's the wrong goal!

1211
01:20:58.969 --> 01:21:00.178
Game Bone Crushers!

1212
01:21:02.014 --> 01:21:07.518
Oh!

1213
01:21:12.566 --> 01:21:13.649
But he...

1214
01:21:37.049 --> 01:21:38.299
Just like you practiced it, huh?

1215
01:22:03.408 --> 01:22:05.493
When we're dreaming up the kid that
we never thought we would get,


1216
01:22:05.577 --> 01:22:06.994
I should have said,
"The winning goal for his team!"


1217
01:22:07.079 --> 01:22:08.412
- That's not what I'm saying!
- What are you saying?


1218
01:22:08.497 --> 01:22:09.497
Shut up!

1219
01:22:09.581 --> 01:22:10.706
It was a failure of my imagination!

1220
01:22:10.791 --> 01:22:12.458
Your mistake was simple!

1221
01:22:12.543 --> 01:22:15.002
Oh, my mistake?
So, you think it was my fault?


1222
01:22:15.087 --> 01:22:17.255
You needed him to
score for you to make you...


1223
01:22:18.215 --> 01:22:20.258
Tell me you didn't love

1224
01:22:20.342 --> 01:22:22.343
the idea of rubbing it in Brenda's face.

1225
01:22:22.469 --> 01:22:23.511
Oh, please!

1226
01:22:23.595 --> 01:22:25.638
You think you're better than your sister,
and you're not.


1227
01:22:25.722 --> 01:22:27.765
You are worse than your father!

1228
01:22:29.685 --> 01:22:30.768
What?

1229
01:22:37.442 --> 01:22:38.609
No.

1230
01:22:40.237 --> 01:22:41.362
No, no, no.

1231
01:22:41.446 --> 01:22:42.738
Stop it!

1232
01:22:44.241 --> 01:22:47.076
I am not the only bad parent
in this house!


1233
01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.494
Look, it's not a competition

1234
01:22:48.579 --> 01:22:50.204
to see who can be the worst parent!

1235
01:22:50.289 --> 01:22:52.164
No, I am saying
we're both terrible at this!


1236
01:22:52.249 --> 01:22:54.041
We are! We don't know anything!

1237
01:22:54.126 --> 01:22:55.418
You're right! We know nothing!

1238
01:22:55.502 --> 01:22:57.587
We were monsters out there today.

1239
01:22:57.671 --> 01:22:59.547
Stop! Stop fighting!

1240
01:22:59.631 --> 01:23:00.756
Oh, God.

1241
01:23:04.136 --> 01:23:05.261
I need to tell you something.

1242
01:23:05.345 --> 01:23:07.305
Buddy, we want to tell you something.

1243
01:23:07.389 --> 01:23:08.514
- No!
- You deserve better.


1244
01:23:08.599 --> 01:23:10.600
We will be better parents.
We will do better.


1245
01:23:10.684 --> 01:23:12.059
- I promise.
- Please...


1246
01:23:12.144 --> 01:23:13.227
Stop.

1247
01:23:15.647 --> 01:23:17.106
Your time is up.

1248
01:23:17.232 --> 01:23:18.316
- No, it can't be.
- No.


1249
01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.483
Actually, you ran over.

1250
01:23:19.568 --> 01:23:21.444
- By three minutes.
- You have to let us finish.


1251
01:23:21.528 --> 01:23:23.738
You have to hear the whole thing.
You have to.


1252
01:23:23.822 --> 01:23:26.198
Excuse me.
With all due respect, we're not leaving.


1253
01:23:34.207 --> 01:23:35.249
Okay.

1254
01:23:37.294 --> 01:23:40.171
Tots, Timbo? There you go.

1255
01:23:43.508 --> 01:23:44.800
Get them next year.

1256
01:23:46.678 --> 01:23:48.179
- Want some?
- No, thank you.


1257
01:23:52.517 --> 01:23:54.518
Boys, come on.
We're going home.


1258
01:23:55.187 --> 01:23:56.562
We're going home! 
What did I say?

1259
01:23:56.647 --> 01:23:58.648
No, that's somebody's job. Let's go.

1260
01:24:01.193 --> 01:24:02.443
Mom and Dad?

1261
01:24:04.488 --> 01:24:07.448
This is Joni,
the coolest girl you ever hope to meet.


1262
01:24:09.368 --> 01:24:10.409
Wow. Hi.

1263
01:24:10.869 --> 01:24:12.703
Nice to see you again.

1264
01:24:12.788 --> 01:24:13.871
Hi.

1265
01:24:14.748 --> 01:24:17.500
Well, okay, bye.

1266
01:24:21.713 --> 01:24:22.755
There it is.

1267
01:24:23.882 --> 01:24:25.383
Love and be loved.

1268
01:24:30.305 --> 01:24:32.807
- Where are they going?
- I don't know.


1269
01:24:33.892 --> 01:24:35.601
Let them go. Let them go.

1270
01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:44.902
Yeah.

1271
01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:48.406
I know we've
had a great time together.


1272
01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:49.573
Me, too.

1273
01:24:50.242 --> 01:24:52.660
I didn't tell my parents because

1274
01:24:52.911 --> 01:24:55.121
they couldn't have
done anything about it.


1275
01:24:58.333 --> 01:25:00.167
There's something
you need to know about me.


1276
01:25:00.252 --> 01:25:01.252
What is it?

1277
01:25:14.933 --> 01:25:16.934
There's nothing I can do about it.

1278
01:25:18.437 --> 01:25:20.104
Everything's going to be okay.

1279
01:25:28.113 --> 01:25:29.196
Good night.

1280
01:25:29.281 --> 01:25:30.448
Oh, good night.

1281
01:25:30.532 --> 01:25:31.615
Timothy!

1282
01:25:38.123 --> 01:25:40.124
Oh, I am so confused.

1283
01:26:02.147 --> 01:26:03.189
Guys?

1284
01:26:04.441 --> 01:26:05.524
Oh, hey!

1285
01:26:07.486 --> 01:26:08.527
We were spying.

1286
01:26:08.612 --> 01:26:09.904
Yeah, we couldn't help ourselves.

1287
01:26:09.988 --> 01:26:11.572
- Oh, she's lovely.
- Yeah.


1288
01:26:12.157 --> 01:26:13.949
We really like her.

1289
01:26:14.034 --> 01:26:15.034
Yeah.

1290
01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.368
I more than like her.

1291
01:26:16.453 --> 01:26:17.912
Well, of course.

1292
01:26:17.996 --> 01:26:19.371
I don't mean to pry, buddy,

1293
01:26:19.456 --> 01:26:21.248
but it looks like
you just broke up with her.


1294
01:26:21.458 --> 01:26:24.251
No. I let her go.

1295
01:26:25.170 --> 01:26:26.504
Why would you do that?

1296
01:26:26.588 --> 01:26:27.588
Especially if you more than like her.

1297
01:26:27.672 --> 01:26:28.672
Yeah.

1298
01:26:29.674 --> 01:26:31.300
You don't get it.

1299
01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.056
He was right.

1300
01:26:38.141 --> 01:26:39.391
We didn't get it.

1301
01:26:41.019 --> 01:26:42.520
But we were about to.

1302
01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.647
We just want to work!

1303
01:26:44.731 --> 01:26:45.648
Yeah, we want to work.

1304
01:26:46.399 --> 01:26:47.608
My grandfather worked for you.

1305
01:26:48.026 --> 01:26:50.111
My father did. My brothers.

1306
01:26:50.195 --> 01:26:52.613
24 years! He's given you 24 years!

1307
01:26:52.697 --> 01:26:53.781
The meeting was about

1308
01:26:53.865 --> 01:26:55.449
whether the factory was going to close.

1309
01:26:55.534 --> 01:26:57.493
- And the whole town showed up.
- Everybody.


1310
01:26:58.036 --> 01:26:59.787
Good evening.
I know you're all upset,


1311
01:27:00.038 --> 01:27:01.413
but if you could just
give me a few minutes.


1312
01:27:02.165 --> 01:27:03.791
You've heard the rumors

1313
01:27:03.875 --> 01:27:05.417
that our factory here in Stanleyville

1314
01:27:05.502 --> 01:27:06.710
is going to close.

1315
01:27:07.087 --> 01:27:10.047
That's what we thought.
As it turned out...


1316
01:27:10.173 --> 01:27:15.052
But... But something
unexpected happened.


1317
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:19.306
A little miracle. 
And here it is.

1318
01:27:20.642 --> 01:27:22.476
This is a new kind of pencil

1319
01:27:22.561 --> 01:27:25.479
made almost entirely out of leaves.

1320
01:27:25.564 --> 01:27:26.564
A new kind of pencil.

1321
01:27:28.191 --> 01:27:30.151
The pencil that Timothy
had asked us to make.


1322
01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:34.530
It will not only save trees,
but will save our factory.


1323
01:27:40.579 --> 01:27:41.745
Don't thank me.

1324
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:43.164
I did not have the vision

1325
01:27:43.248 --> 01:27:44.832
to come up with this revolutionary idea.

1326
01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:48.210
But allow me to
introduce you to who did.


1327
01:27:49.713 --> 01:27:53.174
My son, Franklin Crudstaff.

1328
01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:03.142
I can't begin to
describe the feeling of pride I have.


1329
01:28:03.602 --> 01:28:05.102
Quite frankly, Franklin,

1330
01:28:05.187 --> 01:28:07.271
I didn't think you had it in you.

1331
01:28:07.564 --> 01:28:08.606
He didn't.

1332
01:28:09.774 --> 01:28:11.358
He didn't have it in him.

1333
01:28:11.443 --> 01:28:13.235
The new pencil
was thought up by my parents,


1334
01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.445
Jim and Cindy Green.

1335
01:28:16.114 --> 01:28:17.072
Oh, look here.

1336
01:28:17.157 --> 01:28:18.240
It's the boy who kicked the winning goal

1337
01:28:18.325 --> 01:28:19.700
for the other team.

1338
01:28:21.077 --> 01:28:22.870
Hey, hey, stop, Franklin.

1339
01:28:22.954 --> 01:28:25.247
Well, he's obviously confused again.

1340
01:28:25.332 --> 01:28:27.249
He shoots. He scores. We lose.

1341
01:28:27.375 --> 01:28:31.337
Hey! Enough. Do not pick on my son.

1342
01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.506
The truth is,

1343
01:28:34.591 --> 01:28:37.801
the only reason that
Cindy and I came up


1344
01:28:37.886 --> 01:28:39.553
with the idea for the leaf pencil

1345
01:28:39.638 --> 01:28:42.389
is because he believed
that we could. He's the reason.


1346
01:28:43.308 --> 01:28:44.558
And if you call him a liar,

1347
01:28:44.643 --> 01:28:47.353
if you ever so much as
even look at him funny,


1348
01:28:47.437 --> 01:28:49.104
you will have to deal with me.

1349
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:50.272
And me.

1350
01:28:56.863 --> 01:28:58.197
How touching.

1351
01:29:01.326 --> 01:29:04.828
Tell me, how did you
come up with this idea


1352
01:29:04.913 --> 01:29:07.665
to make a pencil out of leaves.

1353
01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:09.333
Franklin?

1354
01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:15.798
Well, it seems kind of obvious, really.

1355
01:29:16.508 --> 01:29:19.718
Uh, leaves are everywhere. And, uh...

1356
01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:23.305
- ...pencil.
- How about you?


1357
01:29:25.934 --> 01:29:29.436
Ever since Timothy came to us,
leaves have been a big,


1358
01:29:30.522 --> 01:29:31.855
a big part of our lives.

1359
01:29:32.232 --> 01:29:33.524
Why?

1360
01:29:35.694 --> 01:29:36.694
Well?

1361
01:29:37.696 --> 01:29:39.446
Because I have leaves on my legs.

1362
01:29:42.367 --> 01:29:43.826
Leaves on your legs.

1363
01:29:45.203 --> 01:29:49.540
Yes. Our son, Timothy,
has leaves on his legs.


1364
01:29:53.253 --> 01:29:55.713
And we didn't tell
you guys because we were afraid.


1365
01:29:57.882 --> 01:29:59.383
And kind of ashamed.

1366
01:30:01.428 --> 01:30:03.220
I even tried to cut his leaves off.

1367
01:30:03.346 --> 01:30:05.639
Surely you don't
expect us to believe that...


1368
01:30:05.724 --> 01:30:07.224
I've seen the leaves.

1369
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:09.435
They're spectacular.

1370
01:30:10.687 --> 01:30:13.480
And it's okay to be different.
A little weird, even.


1371
01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:16.900
Thank you.

1372
01:30:19.779 --> 01:30:21.447
It doesn't matter if
you believe us or not.

1373
01:30:21.531 --> 01:30:23.240
I'd like to see the leaves.

1374
01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.541
It is up to you. 
You don't have to.

1375
01:30:32.625 --> 01:30:35.252
It's okay. It's time.

1376
01:30:52.562 --> 01:30:53.604
Oops.

1377
01:31:06.618 --> 01:31:08.702
Now that's amazing.

1378
01:31:10.914 --> 01:31:12.456
I used to have more.

1379
01:31:14.042 --> 01:31:16.585
Ifthis boy can
have a leaf on his ankle,


1380
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:18.879
then we can make
a pencil out of leaves.


1381
01:31:19.547 --> 01:31:21.006
Let's all go to work!

1382
01:31:31.351 --> 01:31:33.519
Wow!
You guys were incredible.


1383
01:31:33.645 --> 01:31:36.522
Timothy, what happened to your leaves?

1384
01:31:37.565 --> 01:31:38.982
Oh, you know.

1385
01:31:39.734 --> 01:31:42.319
No. We don't know.

1386
01:31:42.946 --> 01:31:44.405
He wouldn't tell us.

1387
01:31:44.489 --> 01:31:45.739
No. He was quiet.

1388
01:32:00.004 --> 01:32:02.798
We were in
the middle of something.


1389
01:32:02.882 --> 01:32:04.633
We didn't know what.

1390
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.682
But Timothy knew. 
He stayed calm.

1391
01:32:12.434 --> 01:32:14.977
He knew, and he was okay with it.

1392
01:32:24.404 --> 01:32:25.696
It was beautiful.

1393
01:32:26.656 --> 01:32:27.948
It was really beautiful.

1394
01:32:30.368 --> 01:32:31.535
Timothy.

1395
01:32:32.745 --> 01:32:34.037
What aren't you telling us?

1396
01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:37.040
We should get inside.

1397
01:32:37.792 --> 01:32:39.084
- Get inside.
- Come on.


1398
01:32:49.012 --> 01:32:49.970
I didn't tell you before

1399
01:32:50.054 --> 01:32:51.889
because there's nothing
you could have done.


1400
01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.977
About my leaves...

1401
01:32:57.979 --> 01:32:59.062
What about them?

1402
01:33:00.732 --> 01:33:01.773
Please, please tell us.

1403
01:33:03.902 --> 01:33:05.360
When my leaves go...

1404
01:33:08.448 --> 01:33:09.948
You go, too, don't you?

1405
01:33:14.913 --> 01:33:16.413
When?

1406
01:33:24.506 --> 01:33:25.506
Now.

1407
01:33:25.715 --> 01:33:27.007
No, no.

1408
01:33:27.592 --> 01:33:29.927
No, sweetie. You can't.

1409
01:33:30.094 --> 01:33:33.096
It's nothing you did.
It's how it's supposed to be.


1410
01:33:33.681 --> 01:33:35.098
There's only so much time.

1411
01:33:36.434 --> 01:33:38.685
Other kids grow up and move away.

1412
01:33:39.604 --> 01:33:41.563
I lose my leaves and move on.

1413
01:33:41.689 --> 01:33:42.814
Oh, sweetie, you can't.

1414
01:33:43.483 --> 01:33:45.609
There is so much that
we have left to do.

1415
01:33:45.693 --> 01:33:47.736
We're just starting to get good at this.

1416
01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:49.446
You're ready.

1417
01:33:50.073 --> 01:33:51.823
- You were always ready.
- Oh, baby.


1418
01:33:56.329 --> 01:33:57.496
Never give up.

1419
01:34:06.589 --> 01:34:07.589
Timothy?

1420
01:34:08.132 --> 01:34:09.550
- Timothy?
- Jim.


1421
01:34:15.974 --> 01:34:17.057
Oh!

1422
01:34:22.605 --> 01:34:23.855
- Jim.
- Yeah?


1423
01:34:54.137 --> 01:34:55.137
Oh, Jim.

1424
01:34:57.098 --> 01:34:58.765
Here, here, here, here.

1425
01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.051
What was in the box?

1426
01:35:45.688 --> 01:35:46.897
This.

1427
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.590
Thank you. I think that's all we'll need.

1428
01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:17.594
That's it?

1429
01:36:18.262 --> 01:36:19.262
That...

1430
01:36:19.555 --> 01:36:22.099
Thank you.

1431
01:36:32.610 --> 01:36:34.069
Dear Mom and Dad.

1432
01:36:36.823 --> 01:36:40.617
About my leaves, 
I gave them all away.

1433
01:36:42.704 --> 01:36:44.287
It's what you do with gifts.

1434
01:36:47.166 --> 01:36:49.042
I gave one to Aunt Brenda

1435
01:36:50.294 --> 01:36:52.087
so now she can rock.

1436
01:36:56.801 --> 01:36:58.844
I wanted Uncle Bub to have one.

1437
01:37:01.305 --> 01:37:02.681
And Miss Crudstaff.

1438
01:37:04.809 --> 01:37:08.937
Coach Cal got one.
He said it was my best kick ever.


1439
01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:14.234
I gave one to Reggie,
because he really liked them.


1440
01:37:18.614 --> 01:37:22.868
I left one for Grandpa Jim
where I know he'll find it.


1441
01:37:31.210 --> 01:37:34.171
And Joni, she got two.

1442
01:37:36.841 --> 01:37:41.011
And for you guys, here's what I know.

1443
01:37:43.681 --> 01:37:45.682
If you came to me and said,

1444
01:37:46.184 --> 01:37:48.268
"There are two people in the world

1445
01:37:48.352 --> 01:37:50.187
"who want you more than anything."

1446
01:37:50.271 --> 01:37:51.354
Jim!

1447
01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:56.234
"They'll do their best.
They'll make some mistakes.


1448
01:37:57.361 --> 01:38:00.071
"And you'll only get them
for a short time.


1449
01:38:01.741 --> 01:38:04.701
"But they will love you
more than you can ever imagine."


1450
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:12.375
Well, when that's true, I'd say,

1451
01:38:14.378 --> 01:38:16.379
"So much is possible."

1452
01:38:36.234 --> 01:38:39.736
Hi.

1453
01:38:40.112 --> 01:38:41.238
Hi.

1454
01:38:42.281 --> 01:38:43.365
I'm Cindy.

1455
01:38:43.783 --> 01:38:44.908
I'm Jim.

1456
01:38:49.247 --> 01:38:50.288
And you can call us...

1457
01:38:50.373 --> 01:38:51.873
Whatever you want.

1458
01:38:53.084 --> 01:38:54.334
I'm Lily.

1459
01:38:58.673 --> 01:39:00.048
You want to come inside?

1460
01:40:11.913 --> 01:40:15.165
This gift will last forever

1461
01:40:15.249 --> 01:40:18.501
