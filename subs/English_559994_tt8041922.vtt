Alicia: You're not in a hurry?

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.639
-: Nope, one more client.

Alicia: Ugh, late night.

15
00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:48.393
-: Yep, if she shows.

16
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.020
Alicia: Do you mind
finishing up in the back?

17
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.250
I'm running late already.

18
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.083
-: I got it.

19
00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:54.340

21
00:00:55.173 --> 00:00:56.006
How do I look?

22
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.800
-: Beautiful, lady.

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.110
He doesn't wait, he's an idiot.

Hey, Mandy.

Come on over.

30
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.110
I know I was in full
support of growing out the hair,

31
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.883
but it's been too long, I missed you.

00:01:21.883 --> 00:01:22.982
(Mandy laughs)

33
00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:23.900

34
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.993
I've been so busy.

35
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.283
-: So, what are we doin' tonight?

36
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.500
Mandy: A wash and a blowout.

37
00:01:32.427 --> 00:01:33.600

38
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.742

Claire: I was gonna
offer you some wine, but--

40
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.403
-: Red?

41
00:01:37.403 --> 00:01:38.930
Claire: Uh, I think so.

42
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.406
-: I can make time for that.

43
00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:41.402
Claire: (laughs) Okay.

44
00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:42.402
-: Thank you.

45
00:01:43.393 --> 00:01:44.912

47
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.848

Claire: There you go.

50
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.404
-: Oh, thank you.

51
00:01:59.393 --> 00:02:00.853
-: So, what's the hurry?

52
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.283
-: Ugh, throwing a
gigantic party later this evening.

53
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.890
Boss' 25th anniversary with the company. (sighs)

54
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.913
I need to look perfect.

55
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.167
Claire: We can do that.

56
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.710
-: I'm hoping this goes a long way

57
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.983
towards finally getting that promotion.

58
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.179
That glass ceiling is a real bitch.

59
00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.679
(eerie music)

60
00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:40.131
-: So where's the party gonna be?

61
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:41.837
-: The Benjamin Lofts.

62
00:02:41.837 --> 00:02:43.420
Have you ever been?

63
00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:45.348
Mm.

64
00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:47.990
It is so gorgeous.

65
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.232
And I hired the best caterer.

66
00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:52.649
Oh, it's gonna taste so good.

67
00:03:04.977 --> 00:03:07.644
(ominous music)

68
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.963
-: Mandy?

69
00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:49.148
Finally.

70
00:03:49.148 --> 00:03:51.815
(ominous music)

71
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.519
(loud thudding)
(laughing)


72
00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:35.352
Fuck.

73
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:03.636
(sighing)

74
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:09.754
-: What?

75
00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:13.482
(screaming)

76
00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:15.913
-: Mandy, Mandy, calm down, calm down.

77
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:17.429
-: Claire!
-: You're gonna hurt yourself.


78
00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:18.469
-: Claire, what's happening?!

79
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:19.722
-: I just wanna try it on, okay?

80
00:07:19.722 --> 00:07:21.096
I'm gonna give it back.

81
00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:23.389
I just, I need you to be quiet.

82
00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:24.760
Okay?
-: What the fuck, Claire?!


83
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.175
-: No, I just, 
I need you, just.

84
00:07:28.175 --> 00:07:30.092
Please, please, please.

85
00:07:31.306 --> 00:07:32.293
I.

86
00:07:32.293 --> 00:07:33.790
-: Help me!

87
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.623
(Claire groans)

88
00:07:34.623 --> 00:07:37.373
(loud squishing)

89
00:07:51.773 --> 00:07:54.523
(Claire panting)

90
00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:03.416
(gentle piano music)

91
00:08:09.745 --> 00:08:11.070
-: Hi, Pepper.

92
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.850
Where's my girl?

93
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.390
Come here, baby.

94
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.260
Good girl.

95
00:09:14.891 --> 00:09:16.308
Look what I have.

96
00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:19.333
It's a good one, isn't it?

97
00:09:21.824 --> 00:09:23.824
(sighs)

98

(sighs)

101
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.443
I need to look perfect.

102
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.023
I need to look perfect. (chuckles)

103
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.800
I need to look perfect.

107
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.073
Oh!

108
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.243
That glass ceiling is a real bitch.

109
00:11:44.468 --> 00:11:46.718
(chuckles)

110
00:12:02.726 --> 00:12:04.893

just to see you there.

Clerk: Rough night?

116
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.680
Aaron: Yeah, I'm hurting a little bit, dude.

117
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.178
Clerk: Ah, you can see it. (laughs)

118
00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:26.052
Aaron: Hold on, you know what,

119
00:12:26.052 --> 00:12:26.885
I gotta get a bottle of water.

120
00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:31.210
Clerk: Ah, mate, ah, you're drinkin', man.

121
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.730
Aaron: So, what you up to today?

122
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.902
Clerk: This is it,
this is my every day.

123
00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:36.735
Aaron: Yeah?

124
00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:37.721
-: Yeah.
-: Lucky to get out,


125
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:39.456
take advantage of the sun?

126
00:12:39.456 --> 00:12:42.373
(speaking faintly)

127
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.662

and the daughter is 12.

133
00:13:18.477 --> 00:13:19.522
-: Yeah.
-: Awful.


134
00:13:19.522 --> 00:13:23.951
-: I know, what you
do if your 12-year-old got pregnant?

135
00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:26.008
Clerk: (laughs) What would you do, Aaron?

136
00:13:26.008 --> 00:13:27.729
Wouldn't be prepared for that, would you?

137
00:13:27.729 --> 00:13:29.808
(man in red hoodie sighs)

138
00:13:29.808 --> 00:13:33.191
(speaking faintly)

139
00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:34.100
You better go out and
enjoy the sun yourself, yeah.

140
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.683

I'm gonna try.

(man in red hoodie panting)

144
00:14:18.862 --> 00:14:21.144
I don't know, man, probably.

145
00:14:21.144 --> 00:14:22.702
Sure, dude, fuckin' hit me up.

146
00:14:22.702 --> 00:14:25.870
Um, I'm gonna be around there, 
I mean, not too late.

147
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.139
Nine o'clock?

148
00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:28.172
Yeah, so just get in touch with me,

149
00:14:28.172 --> 00:14:31.118
and then maybe we can
grab a couple of beers

150
00:14:31.118 --> 00:14:32.659
and get a little wild or something.

151

00:20:36.777 --> 00:20:39.027

(groaning)

181
00:24:09.412 --> 00:24:11.849
(traffic rumbling)
(people chattering)


182
00:24:11.849 --> 00:24:14.184
(electrical whirring)

183
00:24:14.184 --> 00:24:17.101
(speaking faintly)

184
00:24:28.543 --> 00:24:30.214
(electrical whirring)

185
00:24:30.214 --> 00:24:32.640
-: You think you can be here, bastard, 
I fuckin' told you.

186
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.407
Stay the fuck away from here.

187
00:24:40.616 --> 00:24:45.616
(tense music)
(panting)


188
00:24:45.766 --> 00:24:48.433
(siren wailing)

189
00:24:51.813 --> 00:24:54.480
(heart beating)

190
00:24:59.791 --> 00:25:01.958
(panting)

191
00:25:28.388 --> 00:25:30.638
(coughing)

192
00:25:32.445 --> 00:25:34.612
(panting)

193
00:26:19.862 --> 00:26:22.112
(coughing)

194
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.577
(panting)

195
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.580
(tense music)

196
00:27:10.868 --> 00:27:13.035
(panting)

197
00:27:37.738 --> 00:27:39.905
(panting)

198
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.407
(laughing lightly)

199
00:27:44.407 --> 00:27:46.574
(panting)

200
00:28:18.821 --> 00:28:21.071
(groaning)

201
00:28:26.184 --> 00:28:28.601

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.257

00:28:34.147 --> 00:28:36.897
(sirens wailing)

00:28:49.487 --> 00:28:51.820
(screaming)

(panting)

210
00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.670
(eerie music)

211
00:29:35.332 --> 00:29:37.180
(sobbing)

212
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.300
(loud banging)

213
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.478
Officer: Police!

214
00:29:39.478 --> 00:29:41.915
(loud banging)

215
00:29:41.915 --> 00:29:43.082
Open the door!

216
00:29:45.046 --> 00:29:48.879
(singing in foreign language)

217
00:29:49.872 --> 00:29:51.541
(sobbing)

218
00:29:51.541 --> 00:29:54.124
(loud banging)

219
00:29:55.429 --> 00:29:56.262
Police!

220
00:29:57.236 --> 00:29:59.653
(whimpering)

221
00:30:01.442 --> 00:30:03.775
(screaming)

222
00:30:12.875 --> 00:30:15.042
(sobbing)

223
00:30:17.812 --> 00:30:20.312
(tense music)

224
00:30:36.938 --> 00:30:39.438
(eerie music)

225
00:30:43.209 --> 00:30:44.042
(light music)

226
00:30:44.042 --> 00:30:45.740
-: No dream, Mueller.

227
00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.883
You got the invite.

228
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.330
They called and told me about it yesterday.

229
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.530
-: And you waited until
now to tell me, Chef?

230
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.780
-: Well, I thought it'd be
fun to let you stew a bit.

231
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.780
-: Man, I thought
you were mad at me

232
00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.910
for screwing up the payroll last week.

233
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.060
-: Yeah, that's what made it
so much fun to let you stew.

234
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.370
-: Do you know
how long I've been waiting

235
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.600
for an invitation to Kitchen X?

236
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.890
-: Yeah, you've been going
on about it for months.

237
00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.660
Keep in mind, it's a secret.

238
00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.080
There's a reason Kitchen X

239
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.010
is called an underground restaurant.

240
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:17.960
Health Department nearly shut us
down a few years ago

241
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.850
because some food blogger got too mouthy.

242
00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:23.003
This stays between you and me.

243
00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.000
God, I hate the Health Department.

244
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.730
-: Look, even if I
had anyone to tell, I wouldn't.

245
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.640
-: I'm serious, 
Mueller, you can't tell anyone.

246
00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.740
You can't tell any waitresses or customers

247
00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.490
or any of your foodie
friends in your foodie chatrooms.

248
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.803
No one, not even your girlfriend.

249
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:47.280
-: Hannah, I have officially
been invited to Kitchen X.

250
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.180
-: That's great, hun.

251
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.720
I wish I wasn't outta
town or I'd go with you.

252
00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.090
Although, you might wanna be careful

253
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.210
who you share this info with.

254
00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:01.910
You haven't told anyone else, have you?

255
00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.350
-: No, no, I
promised Chef John I wouldn't,

256
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.700
but I had to tell somebody.

257
00:32:06.807 --> 00:32:08.993
Hannah, this is it.

258
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.686
This is what my
life has been heading towards.

259
00:32:12.686 --> 00:32:14.110
(laughs) I've been working at a restaurant

260
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.050
for as long as I can remember.

261
00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:16.883
When I was a kid,

262
00:32:16.883 --> 00:32:18.320
I worked for the neighborhood diner washing dishes.

263
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.010
I worked my way through college serving tables.

264
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.090
Fast forward to now,

265
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:24.960
and I am the
general manager of a four-star,

266
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.120
chef-driven, fine-dining establishment,

267
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.170
serving some of the best food in town.

268
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.330
-: Well, you seem to enjoy working there.

269
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.380
-: It's a great
job, pay's not bad either.

270
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.213
But to be honest,

271
00:32:36.213 --> 00:32:37.780
the best reward is
getting to work with someone

272
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.500
that's the caliber of Chef John Lando.

273
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.020
The food, the food is killer,

274
00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.060
especially in the last couple of months.

275
00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.790
And you know me, 
I like trying new recipes, 
I like to cook,

276
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.640
but (chuckles) if I've got Chef John

277
00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.010
cooking for me, why bother?

278
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.260
Hannah: You're lucky to
be doing what you love.

279
00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.780
I've never met anyone who's as
much into food as you are.

280
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.883
-: I can't help it!

281
00:32:58.901 --> 00:33:00.070
You know, lately, 
I've been reading more cookbooks

282
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.685
than I have fiction

283
00:33:01.685 --> 00:33:04.723
and watching more Food
Network than I have films.

284
00:33:05.987 --> 00:33:08.405
Oh, speaking of which, it's
a new Wine Dungeon commercial.

285
00:33:08.405 --> 00:33:11.445
(peaceful music)

286
00:33:11.445 --> 00:33:12.782
(heels clicking)

287
00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:13.782
Greg: Mm.

288
00:33:15.506 --> 00:33:18.780
-: Slave, what is that you are drinking?

289
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.430
It's not a corporate-produced wine, is it?

290
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:25.201
-: No Mistress Beth, it
is a state-grown, I swear it.

291
00:33:25.201 --> 00:33:30.201
-: Ah, Riesling, 
I see you are learning. (giggles)

292
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.220
This Riesling is not dry!

293
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.750
Don't you Americans know

294
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.640
that your Riesling doesn't have to be sweet?

295
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.650
Haven't you learned anything?

296
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:41.086
(whip snaps)

297
00:33:41.086 --> 00:33:42.720
(whip snapping)

298
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.120
Don't be punished by corporate wines.

299
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.320
Don't let bad wines put you in submission.

300
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.270
Come to the Wine Dungeon
and get what you deserve.

301
00:33:51.668 --> 00:33:52.876
(whip snaps)

302
00:33:52.876 --> 00:33:57.123
-: Get 30% off
when you mention this ad.

303
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.488
Hannah: Mueller, Mueller!

304
00:34:01.488 --> 00:34:02.321
(Mueller chuckles)

305
00:34:02.321 --> 00:34:04.600
-: Sorry, I got sidetracked, bleh.

306
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.500
What was I saying?

307
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.790
Oh yeah, look, if you were to say

308
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:11.560
my life revolves around food, 
I'd say you were right,

309
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.333
and that is a life well-rewarded.

310
00:34:19.785 --> 00:34:22.285
(tense music)

311
00:34:39.503 --> 00:34:40.336
Hey Chef.

312
00:34:40.336 --> 00:34:41.655
John: You ready?

313
00:34:41.655 --> 00:34:42.500
-: You have no idea.

314
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.333
Where is this place?

315
00:34:43.333 --> 00:34:44.500
-: North of town, don't worry about it.

316
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.300
I'll drive, you leave your car here.

317
00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.080
What the hell is that?

318
00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.340
Mueller: Bottle of wine I brought for dinner.

319
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.430
-: No, don't even think about bringing that.

320
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:55.120
Greg and Beth are pairing wines tonight.

321
00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.000
-: Greg and Beth from the Wine Dungeon?

322
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.960
-: The very same.

323
00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.493
Do yourself a favor,
leave that in your car.

324
00:35:08.082 --> 00:35:10.582
(tense music)

325
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.370
-: How many of these
things have you been to, Chef?

326
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:22.740
John: Quite a few now.

327
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.300
Each one gets better.

328
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.230
The kid running this thing

329
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.720
really pushes the envelop with each dinner,

330
00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.830
exposing us all to
things we've never tried before.

331
00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:30.910
Mueller: Who brought you your first time?

332
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:31.750
-: French Milt.

333
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.268
-: Whoa, French Milt?

334
00:35:33.268 --> 00:35:36.018
(dramatic music)

335
00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.940
(women moaning)

336
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.200
He's gonna be here tonight?

337
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.300
-: Oh, he wouldn't miss it.

338
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.473
He usually contributes a
little something on his own.

339
00:35:50.452 --> 00:35:53.119
(Mueller sighs)

340
00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.520
(tense music)

341
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:58.363
-: Ah!

342
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.510
Welcome, my friends.

343
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.943
Welcome to Kitchen X.

344
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.450
-: It is definitely my pleasure

345
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.400
to serve you this evening, Mr. Mueller.

346
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.480
-: That's Teddy from Spirits Speakeasy.

347
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.270
I love the cocktails there.

348
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:22.103
-: Come.

349
00:36:25.154 --> 00:36:27.682
(speaking faintly)

350
00:36:27.682 --> 00:36:29.932
(snapping)

351
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.300
May I present diver scallop

352
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.160
wrapped with applewood-smoked bacon,

353
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.880
topped with a pimenton parsnip puree

354
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.880
with Espelette pepper and a mustard seed. (laughs)

355
00:36:50.435 --> 00:36:51.268
(whips snaps)
-: Ow!


356
00:36:51.268 --> 00:36:52.960
-: I paired the scallop with this impressive

357
00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.330
little sparkler from Spain, 
Via dei Borgia,

358
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.520
mostly because I thought
the terroir of a Bourgogne

359
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.130
would have been too overpowering.

360
00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.700
The delicacy of the scallops

361
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.295
seem to call for
something a bit more flighty.

362
00:37:07.295 --> 00:37:10.045
(women laughing)

363
00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:16.420
Hi, I'm Beth, I'm from the Wine Dungeon.

364
00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.253
-: Hi

365
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.510
Uh, I'm a big
fan of you and Greg.

366
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.550
It's an honor to meet you.

367
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:26.023
I'm Mueller, I work
for John at Lando Seafood.

368
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.833
I love your commercials.

369
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.650
-: Oh, thank you, Mueller.

370
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:32.910
Always nice to help someone

371
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:36.261
develop their taste for fine wines.

372
00:37:36.261 --> 00:37:39.500
You don't drink corporate wines, do you?

373
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.983
Because if you do.

374
00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.240
(Mueller gasps)

375
00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.970
I'm just kidding, honey. (laughs)

376
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.710
-: Actually, I put together a wine list

377
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:49.720
for Lando with some of--

378
00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.440
-: I've actually never been there,

379
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.700
but I've heard some nice things.

380
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.683
If you ever want
to develop your wine list,

381
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:58.950
you should give me a call.

382
00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.860
-: You know, I've been there.

383
00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.810
Yeah, I wrote about
its opening in my blog.

384
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.910
I wasn't that impressed with the service.

385
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:13.160
It seemed a bit untrained.

386
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.860
As I mentioned on my blog, you know,

387
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.130
the food was a
bit uneven for my tastes.

388
00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.890
A couple of the commenters
on my blog seem to agree,

389
00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.610
but I'm sure you've worked out those problems.

390
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:25.993
-: I'd like to think we have.

391
00:38:25.993 --> 00:38:28.093
-: Oh, well, in that case,

392
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.085
kudos.

393
00:38:30.085 --> 00:38:32.585
(tense music)

394
00:38:34.175 --> 00:38:36.842
(Mueller sighs)

395
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.700
-: Come, let me
introduce you to some people.

396
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.420
Shannon, have you met Mr. Mueller?

397
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.570
-: I just love your restaurant.

398
00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.700
Why, we haven't chatted since, when was it?

399
00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.760
You know, it seems
like just the other week,

400
00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.350
I was telling Dwayne
over at the farmer's market

401
00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.360
just how good the food
was over at your place.

402
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.015
You know Dwayne, right?

403
00:39:00.015 --> 00:39:00.848
-: Uh, yeah--

404
00:39:00.848 --> 00:39:03.040
-: He just finished
an excellent organic wine dinner

405
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.610
that was mind-blowing.

406
00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.880
I told him that I really loved lobster,

407
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.970
and you know what he does?

408
00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.070
He puts lobster on the menu.

409
00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.080
-: You have met Teddy,

410
00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.673
but have you met French Milt from Amuse-bouche?

411
00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.633
Mueller: It's an honor, Chef.

412
00:39:30.383 --> 00:39:32.382
(Mueller chuckles nervously)

413
00:39:32.382 --> 00:39:34.650
-: The first course is just about ready,

414
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:39.320
and I need to apply some finishing touches.

415
00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.850
Would you mind entertaining Mr. Mueller

416
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.375
while I see to the kitchen?

417
00:39:45.375 --> 00:39:46.208
Ha, thank you.

418
00:39:53.228 --> 00:39:56.210
-: Well, this place is wonderful, huh?

419
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:57.940
How 'bout those scallops, huh?

420
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.660
Amazing, they were soft and velvety,

421
00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.870
and they were wrapped
in that smoked bacon, right?

422
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.880
-: Actually, the bacon should have been described

423
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.980
as cured instead of smoked.

424
00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.290
The devise Brandon used involved pellets

425
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:10.570
instead of actual hardwood,

426
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.470
which negates it as being smoked.

427
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:17.370
And personally, 
I would have referred to it as pork belly,

428
00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.170
since that's where bacon comes from.

429
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.780
You you know that, right?

430
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.980
It comes from the belly?

431
00:40:25.419 --> 00:40:28.390
(Mueller sighs)

432
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:29.700
-: And that was such an inventive pairing,

433
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:34.020
the champagne and the
bubbles and the scallops, wow.

434
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.420
That's all I can say.

435
00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.850
You and Greg really know what you're doing.

436
00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.690
-: It's not really all that inventive,

437
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.050
if you think about it.

438
00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:42.060
The pepper is counteracted

439
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.020
by the cool crispness of the Spanish grape.

440
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.230
The acidity cuts through the
spice at, cuts it in half.

441
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:51.450
In fact, the pairing of sparkling and scallops

442
00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:52.316
is as old--

443
00:40:52.316 --> 00:40:53.870
(bowl chimes)

444
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:57.810
-: Ladies and gentlemen,
course one is now ready.

445
00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.363
Please, join me at the table.

446
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.490
For the first course of this evening,

447
00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:24.490
I am proud to
present my version Reuben deconstructed,

448
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:30.490
complete with a corn beef Wagyu, sauerkraut emulsion,

449
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:35.490
a Swiss cheese cream, 
Russian foam dressing,

450
00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:37.123
and a rye crouton.

451
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.100
I would like to thank Beth and Greg

452
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:46.041
for pairing this with a
lovely pinot from Stover Creek.

453
00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:46.874
(Brandon laughs)

454
00:41:46.874 --> 00:41:49.070
Oh, the '07 vintage, of course.

455
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.427
Beth And Greg: Dungeon approved.

456
00:41:51.427 --> 00:41:52.260
(Beth and Greg laughing)

457
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.740
-: Ah, please, everyone enjoy.

458
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.033
We eat to support life
and to practice the way.

459
00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:21.340
-: Mm, corn beefing Wagyu,.

460
00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.940
Oh Brendan, you are something of a treat.

461
00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.950
-: This is actually my
first time getting to taste Wagyu.

462
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.000
These flavors are amazing.

463
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.450
-: The Japanese believed they
can flavor this exclusive meat

464
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:35.770
with extensive care and attention.

465
00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:38.270
Not only do they control their diet,

466
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:42.310
but they can feed
the cows beer and sake.

467
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:45.060
-: And they massage the cows, dude.

468
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.073
What a way to go.

469
00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.310
-: The flavors in
this dish are so compelling.

470
00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.780
I wish I could take
a photograph for my blog.

471
00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:53.990
-: No photos!

472
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:57.563
-: I know, I just wish I could.

473
00:43:00.083 --> 00:43:02.240
-: Wait till you try the next course.

474
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.140
Kidney.

475
00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.640
-: Oh, how are you cooking the kidney?

476
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.990
-: Oh, kidney is a fun little dish.

477
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.330
First, you gotta get in
and pull off the membrane,

478
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:12.163
but you're gonna need to leave

479
00:43:12.163 --> 00:43:14.420
a little fat on
there for flavor, you know.

480
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.070
Now, most people'll tell ya
that you gotta marinate it

481
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:18.900
with a little vinegar and soy sauce

482
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.140
because it's a pretty stinky organ,

483
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.120
but I like to add just
a little bit of milk in there

484
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.903
to cut right through the flavor.

485
00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:30.460
Then, a little garlic, a little onion,

486
00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.210
and we dice that kidney
up into little half inchers

487
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:35.760
and drop it in, a little simmer.

488
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:39.383
Add some aromatics like
a bonyato or some carrots.

489
00:43:41.947 --> 00:43:45.120
(Mueller sighs)

490
00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.730
What's wrong, Mueller?

491
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:49.103
Little awful talk makin' ya uneasy?

492
00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.350
-: That's the problem with most Americans.

493
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.170
They don't respect the awful.

494
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:57.528
No one seems to
realize that tenderloins are finite.

495
00:43:57.528 --> 00:43:59.877
(Mueller panting)

496
00:43:59.877 --> 00:44:02.660
-: I'm sorry, I got
dizzy all of a sudden.

497
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.877
-: You don't have a
shellfish or peanut allergy, do you?

498
00:44:06.967 --> 00:44:08.370
-: Uh, not that I know of.

499
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:10.380
-: If I had a shellfish allergy,

500
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.830
I'd just have to kill myself.

501
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.080
-: Me too.

502
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.690
My all-time favorite wine is Vermentino,

503
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.740
especially the later Sardinian vintages.

504
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.082
I can't fathom not enjoying shrimp.

505
00:44:21.082 --> 00:44:22.134
(Mueller sighs)

506
00:44:22.134 --> 00:44:22.967
(tense music)

507
00:44:22.967 --> 00:44:23.880
-: What's the matter, buddy?

508
00:44:24.805 --> 00:44:26.760
You don't look so good.

509
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.680
-: I'm sorry, everyone.

510
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.240
I think the bubbles from that champagne

511
00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.890
are going to my head.

512
00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:34.060
-: It's not champagne

513
00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:36.670
unless it comes from the region in France.

514
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.263
What you had was a Spanish Cava.

515
00:44:42.533 --> 00:44:45.370
-: Uh, Mr. Mueller, would
you like to lie down?

516
00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:48.700
I have a little room just
to the right of the kitchen,

517
00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.827
if you like (laughing).

518
00:44:53.061 --> 00:44:54.725
(Mueller gasps)

519
00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:57.558
(Mueller panting)

520
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:03.997
-: Hey buddy, how you doin'?

521
00:45:04.896 --> 00:45:05.796
You did all right.

522
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.083
-: Chef, what's going on?

523
00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.460
Why am I in this tub?

524
00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.330
-: Hang in there, buddy.

525
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:17.100
You just got a little ill at dinner.

526
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.000
You just need to
rest up a little bit.

527
00:45:20.244 --> 00:45:22.300
(Mueller panting)

528
00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.820
-: Chef, Chef, get me outta here.

529
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.783
It's frickin' freezing in here.

530
00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.597
-: We'll get ya
out in a little bit.

531
00:45:28.597 --> 00:45:30.253
You just need to relax.

532
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.550
You don't wanna injure yourself anymore, do ya?

533
00:45:38.596 --> 00:45:41.263
(Mueller gasps)

534
00:45:42.276 --> 00:45:43.508
(tense music)

535
00:45:43.508 --> 00:45:45.591
Mueller: I'm bleeding.

536
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.023
Chef, why am I bleeding?

537
00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.883
Chef, what am I doing in
this tub with all this ice?

538
00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.320
(Mueller gasps)

539
00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.793
-: What, what are you doing?

540
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:02.140
-: French Milt said if that
guy keeps freaking out like that,

541
00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.190
he's gonna pump adrenaline through his body,

542
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.320
and I don't want him spoiling those ribs

543
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.650
before I have a chance to show

544
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.180
the impressive pairing I have for them.

545
00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.330
Rose, buddy.

546
00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:14.270
-: Not in the neck, you idiot.

547
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.600
You think tasting the adrenaline
and the endorphins are bad?

548
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.960
Once those drugs hit his system,

549
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.440
we'll be tasting chemicals all night.

550
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.273
You have any idea

551
00:46:22.273 --> 00:46:24.813
what I've been feeding
this guy for a week?

552
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.911
(peaceful music)

553
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:35.411
(John coughs)

554
00:46:37.151 --> 00:46:38.990
Mueller: Please, somebody help me!

555
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:40.637
-: That would be the dinner bell.

556
00:46:40.637 --> 00:46:43.220
(all laughing)

557
00:46:54.053 --> 00:46:58.350
-: Mm, Brandon, these black
beans are a wonderful addition.

558
00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:00.770
-: The thigh really is more marbled, Milt.

559
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:02.440
You were right.

560
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.463
-: I like the skin, crispy.

561
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.343
-: Where are the skins?

562
00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:11.310
-: Oh, don't worry, pal.

563
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:13.740
I'll get ya some
skins for your doggie bag.

564
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.730
We'll have to process
him before the night's over,

565
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:18.760
so they'll be plenty of stuff for everybody

566
00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.940
for late night snackin'.

567
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.190
-: Bully's picked on me in school.

568
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:23.623
I never really fit in.

569
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:30.153
I admit I thought about
suicide for a long, long time,

570
00:47:31.613 --> 00:47:36.130
but that's when I found
food, and I finally belonged,

571
00:47:37.484 --> 00:47:39.540
and I started the
blog, and it was like,

572
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:44.290
for the first time,
food gave my life meaning.

573
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:47.293
-: He may have been
a little old for my tastes.

574
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:52.831
Think about it, nobody eats a
farm animal in its late 20s.

575
00:47:52.831 --> 00:47:53.840
-: Yeah, that's why your work

576
00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.373
with molecular gastronomy is so amazing.

577
00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.330
It's not tough or stringy at all.

578
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.870
-: So, what's the next course?

579
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:06.020
-: It's something to know

580
00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.810
I can look back on
those bullies back in school

581
00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:11.510
and know that they know nothing

582
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.815
about the difference between cured ham and prosciutto.

583
00:48:14.815 --> 00:48:15.648
(Teddy laughs)

584
00:48:15.648 --> 00:48:18.960
-: Savages know nothing
of sous vide, right? (laughs)

585
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.254
-: Enjoy your white zinfandel, peons.

586
00:48:22.254 --> 00:48:24.837
(Teddy laughs)

587
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.660
-: Check his temperature.

588
00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.370
Don't hit the bone, dude.

589
00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.153
-: I know.

590
00:48:34.095 --> 00:48:37.163
(Mueller screaming)
(tense music)


591
00:48:37.163 --> 00:48:38.303
(Mueller panting)

592
00:48:38.303 --> 00:48:40.703
-: Teddy, Teddy, what's going on?

593
00:48:40.703 --> 00:48:42.330
-: Calm down.

594
00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:46.063
-: Oh my god, is that meat thermometer?

595
00:48:46.063 --> 00:48:48.959
(Mueller sobbing)

596
00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.655
Please, don't do this, please!

597
00:48:50.655 --> 00:48:52.303
Please, don't do this!

598
00:48:52.303 --> 00:48:53.623
-: He's still squealing in here?

599
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.005
-: Check these out.

600
00:48:56.005 --> 00:48:56.870
They come up in New York.

601
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:58.200
This one's for power.

602
00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.350
This one's for finesse.

603
00:49:02.299 --> 00:49:04.553
Plus, they cut through bone, dude.

604
00:49:04.553 --> 00:49:07.053
(tense music)

605
00:49:11.466 --> 00:49:13.383
Mueller: No, no, no!

606
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:16.700
(Mueller screaming)

607
00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.683
-: Hold still or it's
gonna hurt a whole lot worse!

608
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.680
(Mueller screaming)

609
00:49:25.918 --> 00:49:27.500
-: You better get
a rollin' pin in here.

610
00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.820
We gotta shut this guy up!

611
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.390
John: I'll take care of this, French Milt.

612
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.373
Relax, and wrap those fingers in bacon.

613
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:37.626
-: Remember, there's eight of us,

614
00:49:37.626 --> 00:49:39.926
and we need all of
his fingers, and no thumbs.

615
00:49:41.221 --> 00:49:42.554
Those are nasty.

616
00:49:45.671 --> 00:49:48.171
(tense music)

617
00:49:50.459 --> 00:49:52.610
-: I was gonna make a
little pate out of these guys,

618
00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.583
but they went a different route.

619
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:57.330
Personally, I think whole sous vide thing

620
00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:01.922
is a passing phase and
overrated, but when in Rome.

621
00:50:01.922 --> 00:50:04.422
(tense music)

622
00:50:06.973 --> 00:50:09.640
(body thudding)

623
00:50:12.972 --> 00:50:14.105
(peaceful music)

624
00:50:14.105 --> 00:50:16.970
-: Wow, I don't
think we're topping that thigh.

625
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:20.000
Hey, anybody want a Pimm's?

626
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.620
-: Oh, I just adore Pimm's.

627
00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.620
I'll have some.

628
00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.520
-: Don't even think of ruining your palate

629
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.020
with those botanicals.

630
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.660
The juniper in that liquor

631
00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.940
will counteract the delicate tannins

632
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.430
and soft finish of the Burgundy I've selected.

633
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:34.390
-: Oh, but this is gin-based.

634
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.680
I've got the Pimm's number six up.

635
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.820
It's vodka.

636
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.500
-: I thought they
stopped making that years ago.

637
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.333
-: They did.

638
00:50:41.475 --> 00:50:43.975
(tense music)

639
00:50:47.687 --> 00:50:50.520
(Mueller panting)

640
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:54.427
(Mueller groaning)

641
00:50:56.326 --> 00:50:59.159
(Mueller panting)

642
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:20.000
Shannon: So, tell me, Brandon,

643
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.260
what inspired genius we'll be
enjoying in the next course.

644
00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.330
Brandon: Ah, it's a little something

645
00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:28.630
French Milt and John, they dream up.

646
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:32.240
We take the fingers,
we wrap them in bacon,

647
00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.790
and serve them over white bean cassoulet.

648
00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:38.614
The white beans are from the farmer's market.

649
00:51:38.614 --> 00:51:39.447
All: Oh.

650
00:51:39.447 --> 00:51:40.360
(Brandon laughs)

651
00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.240
French: Still think it's fundamentally wrong

652
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.330
that we're keepin' him alive.

653
00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:45.200
I mean, really, it is not right.

654
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.110
Darla: You're being ridiculous.

655
00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:48.293
French: Am I really?

656
00:51:48.293 --> 00:51:50.810
It is a proven fact that the hogfish,

657
00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:54.040
which is headshot in
the Keys, dies more quickly,

658
00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.170
so heart stops pumpin' blood to the organs,

659
00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:58.110
which, in turn, preserves the meat.

660
00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:01.633
The fish never goes into
shock, mean never gets sour.

661
00:52:19.542 --> 00:52:22.459
(Mueller groaning)

662
00:52:23.826 --> 00:52:26.659

(fingers sizzling)

664
00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:51.920
-: Ancient cultures have long believed

665
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.000
that fear seasons the kill.

666
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.360
-: Fear and maybe a
little bit of bacon fat.

667
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.420
Everything tastes better with bacon.

668
00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.983
-: I prefer to do
my flavorings with my meat myself.

669
00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:06.722

(upbeat music)

671
00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:13.980
Hannah: So Brandon, how does he taste?

672
00:53:15.186 --> 00:53:16.019
-: Hannah?

673
00:53:18.338 --> 00:53:19.970
You're a part of this?

674
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:21.074
Hannah: Shit!

675
00:53:21.074 --> 00:53:23.741
(phone buzzing)

676
00:53:26.523 --> 00:53:28.690
-: I actually googled Donner party

677
00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:29.690
cookin' methods the other day.

678
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:31.890
I musta looked at 100 different sites.

679
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:33.790
And there was this very droll documentary

680
00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:35.820
about the whole affair,
which I have to say,

681
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.190
conveniently left out how they prepared the food.

682
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:40.700
-: Oh, that's ridiculous.

683
00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:43.140
Those who don't learn
about mistakes in the past

684
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:45.080
are condemned to repeat them.

685
00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.220
That's what they say. (chuckles)

686
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.110
Or something like that anyway.

687
00:53:50.207 --> 00:53:53.040
-: The only thing I
did find was one word, roasted,

688
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.360
which could mean anything.

689
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.770
I mean, how did they roast it?

690
00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:57.970
Did they use wood
like in a traditional barbecue,

691
00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:02.763
and if so, what
kinda wood, hickory, oak, larch?

692
00:54:02.763 --> 00:54:04.713
-: I think they used mesquite out West.

693
00:54:11.271 --> 00:54:12.479
(tense music)

694
00:54:12.479 --> 00:54:15.229
(Greg screaming)

695
00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:26.097
-: Stop your whining.

696
00:54:33.182 --> 00:54:34.015
-: Greg.

697
00:54:35.006 --> 00:54:38.620
Greg?

698
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:39.453
Greg?

700
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.467
-: Now, it's my pleasure to serve you.

701
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:09.440
-: Where do you think you're going, Mueller?

702
00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.639
Look at you.

703
00:55:10.639 --> 00:55:15.060
Tch, tch, tch, you won't make
it a block in your condition,

704
00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.000
not unless you let me help you.

705
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.103
It's cold out there.

706
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:23.050
-: Give us the bottle, Mueller.

707
00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:26.320
-: Stop being such a naughty boy, Mueller.

708
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.840
You know you don't wanna hurt us.

709
00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.600
If you put that bottle down,

710
00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:33.973
I promise I'll give you
the spanking of your life.

711
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.693
You know you wanna give it to me.

712
00:55:39.105 --> 00:55:40.270
(Beth groaning)

713
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.647

(Beth panting)

716
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:10.370
I am sick and tired

717
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:13.613
of being the one getting cut on.

718
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:17.392
I'm gonna kill everyone of you sick mother--

719

722
00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:35.603
You little food whore.

723
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.460
-: You guys owe me
big time for this one.

724
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:45.130
I was just supposed to seduce the prey.

725
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:47.423
It was your job to make the kill.

726
00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.983
Oh well, the things I
do for a good meal.

727
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:55.003
-: Nice shot, Hannah.

728
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.840
See what I was tellin' ya, Brandon?

729
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.660
Instant kill stops the heart,
meat doesn't go into shock.

730
00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.180
-: I still think there
are exquisite flavors you get

731
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.390
when blood pump through the heart,

732
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.270
especially the fearful heart.

733
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:11.540
You remember pig we have last week.

734
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:12.690

(Darla groans)

736
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.750
-: What do we
do about all these bodies?

737
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:20.100
That's a whole lot of meat.

738
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.250
-: I have a very big deep freezer.

739
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:24.600
Let's chunk these bodies up
and get 'em on ice.

740
00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:27.560
Let's get this heart out quick.

And why are we doing this?

758
00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:36.890
-: I have to
know, once and for all,

759
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:40.093
that what I saw that night wasn't real,

760

that it was just a

He went looking for his
sibling all around the house

776
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.720
and later found him dead in the basement.

777
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.463
He suffered a total

didn't talk or communicate for a year.

782

He blamed himself for his brother's death.

783
01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.343
-: How'd his brother die?

784
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:53.753
-: He bled to death.

785
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:55.953
-: Somebody stabbed him?

786
01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.863

Poor kid.

788
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:06.300
-: By the way, they never
did find his you know what.

789
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.970
-: Or the person who did it,

790
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:09.993
which only added to R.
J.'s paranoia.

791
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:12.990
His religious parents had warned him

792

about playing with himself.

793
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.500
Masturbation was the most sinful thing

794
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.690
you could do in that household,

795
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:20.700
and if you gave into such devilish behavior,

796

806
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.430
but at least we can
get some closure for R.J.'s psyche.

807
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:13.330
The last step is acknowledging

808
01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:18.330
there's no such thing as
demonic creatures in the basement.
