00:07:08.124 --> 00:07:11.174
<i>and I noticed a hammer,</i>
<i>which had blood on it.</i>

159
00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:14.476
The hands of Miss Edna

160
00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:16.741
also had a lot
of broken fingernails


161
00:07:16.784 --> 00:07:19.794
that would indicate to us
that she was in a struggle.


162
00:07:22.312 --> 00:07:25.712
We also noticed ligature marks
around her neck,


163
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.450
as if she was strangled.

164
00:07:28.492 --> 00:07:30.192
<i>And further looking</i> <i>on the floor,</i>

165
00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:32.763
<i>we noticed that there
was</i> <i>a lot of cables</i>

166
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.190
<i>that were laying near her.</i>

167
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:42.291
<i>Seeing Edna,</i> <i>an elderly woman,</i>

168
00:07:42.332 --> 00:07:44.122
<i>lying on the floor,</i>

169
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.730
beaten to death, strangled,

170
00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:48.901
it touches you.

171
00:07:48.947 --> 00:07:50.427
That could be my mom,

172
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.520
or that could be
a family member.


173
00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:55.949
You just...

174
00:07:55.997 --> 00:07:58.087
get in a mode

175
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.520
that you want to do

176
00:08:00.567 --> 00:08:02.527
everything possible

177
00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:04.479
to find this person's killer.

178
00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:10.527
<i>The first question</i> <i>the detectives asked me was,</i>

179
00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:12.097
"Do you know anybody

180
00:08:12.144 --> 00:08:13.754
who your grandmother
had problems with?"


181
00:08:13.798 --> 00:08:16.188
And I was like,

182
00:08:16.235 --> 00:08:17.845
"We are speaking
of my grandmother, right?"


183
00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:21.145
<i>My grandmother</i> <i>was well known</i>

184
00:08:21.197 --> 00:08:23.237
in the community and loved.

185
00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:26.676
The Pierre-Jacques
originated from Haiti,


186
00:08:26.724 --> 00:08:28.814
<i>but they were the second</i>

187
00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:32.766
<i>African
-American family</i> <i>that moved on Troy Avenue.</i>

188
00:08:32.817 --> 00:08:36.337
<i>They came in, like, 1968.</i>

189
00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:40.256
My grandfather owned
his own mechanic shop.


190
00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:43.133
Edna was a seamstress
when I was younger.


191
00:08:44.045 --> 00:08:46.305
<i>My grandparents</i> <i>had four kids,</i>

192
00:08:46.352 --> 00:08:49.092
<i>and my grandmother,</i> <i>she was the glue.</i>

193
00:08:49.138 --> 00:08:51.098
She kept the family together.

194
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.140
Okay.
Now let me serve people.


195
00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:56.616
Everyone used to hang out
at Miss Edna's house.


196
00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:57.927
She used to do our hair.

197
00:08:57.972 --> 00:09:00.282
All the kids in the community
embraced her.


198
00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:03.633
- Forever 21!
- Forever 21!


199
00:09:03.674 --> 00:09:05.984
Mama Edna
loved telling jokes.


200
00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:07.334
She loved making people laugh.

201
00:09:07.373 --> 00:09:08.243
You made your wish?

202
00:09:08.287 --> 00:09:10.247
Oh, my God!
No, shut up!


203
00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:14.857
She loved to dance.
She loved music.


204
00:09:15.512 --> 00:09:18.952
Dancing was a part
of her everyday routine.


205
00:09:18.993 --> 00:09:21.173
And she loved to cook
for people.


206
00:09:21.213 --> 00:09:24.653
Her food was the best

207
00:09:24.695 --> 00:09:27.045
Haitian food
I have ever tasted.


208
00:09:27.088 --> 00:09:28.958
Her food was the best,

209
00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:30.663
her food and her smile.

210
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.754
<i>The family didn't know why</i>

211
00:09:36.794 --> 00:09:39.714
or who would want to hurt

212
00:09:39.753 --> 00:09:42.633
their mom and grandmother
in such a way.


213
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:43.929
<i>♪</i>

214
00:09:43.975 --> 00:09:46.535
<i>Without a clear suspect</i> <i>from the get-go,</i>

215
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:49.286
<i>detectives begin looking</i> <i>into Edna's living situation.</i>

216
00:09:49.328 --> 00:09:52.548
We come
to the immediate conclusion


217
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.422
that the husband is
living under the same roof,


218
00:09:55.465 --> 00:09:58.285
<i>and they're living</i> <i>in different rooms.</i>

219
00:09:59.904 --> 00:10:02.214
<i>Our detectives were stunned</i> <i>to find out</i>

220
00:10:02.254 --> 00:10:05.524
<i>Frederick was inside his room</i>
<i>just steps away from his wife</i>

221
00:10:05.562 --> 00:10:08.002
<i>at the likely time</i> <i>of her murder.</i>

222
00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:11.052
Looking into a spouse
is already standard procedure


223
00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:12.529
in a homicide investigation,

224
00:10:12.569 --> 00:10:15.879
but now Frederick has
some serious explaining to do.


225
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:21.711
<i>So we're talking with him.</i>

226
00:10:21.752 --> 00:10:23.012
<i>He's very emotional,</i>

227
00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:25.537
<i>knowing that his wife is gone,</i>

228
00:10:25.582 --> 00:10:28.062
but we knew
that their relationship


229
00:10:28.106 --> 00:10:29.236
wasn't the best.

230
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:31.461
I mean,
they lived in separate rooms.


231
00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:33.891
<i>We already knew</i> <i>that he was there</i>

232
00:10:33.938 --> 00:10:36.548
<i>and his answer to us</i>

233
00:10:36.593 --> 00:10:40.383
<i>was that he didn't hear</i> <i>or see anything.</i>

234
00:10:41.598 --> 00:10:44.298
So we found that sort of odd.

235
00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:47.391
<i>Detectives Figueroa</i> <i>and Alonso</i>

236
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.090
<i>search Frederick's room</i> <i>for
any sign of foul play.</i>

237
00:10:51.129 --> 00:10:53.909
<i>Instead,</i> <i>they find something strange.</i>

238
00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.738
There was a book open
to a specific page.


239
00:10:57.788 --> 00:11:00.308
<i>The page it was open on,</i>

240
00:11:00.356 --> 00:11:03.526
it had the title
of "How to Get Rid of a Witch."


241
00:11:05.752 --> 00:11:09.232
<i>And it shows that you
write</i> <i>the name of the person,</i>

242
00:11:09.278 --> 00:11:11.058
and you burn
the pieces of paper,


243
00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:12.495
and there was a candle.

244
00:11:12.542 --> 00:11:14.762
And it seemed to have burnt
papers on it,


245
00:11:14.805 --> 00:11:16.495
<i>and right next to it,</i>

246
00:11:16.546 --> 00:11:19.676
<i>we found strips of paper</i>
<i>with Edna's name on it.</i>

247
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.420
Me and my partner,
we looked at each other,


248
00:11:23.466 --> 00:11:28.036
he was like,
"This is Voodoo, witchcraft."


249
00:11:31.735 --> 00:11:33.295
<i>Coming up...</i>

250
00:11:33.345 --> 00:11:34.605
Once we saw the basement,

251
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:37.481
we knew that it could
have been a reason


252
00:11:37.523 --> 00:11:38.923
why Edna was killed.

253
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:40.789
<i>But all of a sudden,</i>

254
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:42.881
the case takes
a different route.


255
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.140
<i>The spirits</i> <i>had taken over her.</i>

256
00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:48.583
It was some sort
of Voodoo spell.


257
00:12:02.766 --> 00:12:05.196
<i>Beloved grandmother,</i> <i>Edna Pierre
-Jacques,</i>

258
00:12:05.246 --> 00:12:08.336
<i>was found strangled to death</i>
<i>in her East Flatbush home.</i>

259
00:12:09.773 --> 00:12:11.603
Now my squad wonders

260
00:12:11.644 --> 00:12:12.914
if her husband, Frederick,

261
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.600
and his apparent belief
in Voodoo


262
00:12:14.647 --> 00:12:16.347
played a role in the murder.

263
00:12:18.085 --> 00:12:20.865
<i>Being that I worked</i> <i>in East Flatbush,</i>

264
00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:23.964
there's a lot of people
that practice Voodoo.


265
00:12:24.527 --> 00:12:26.397
<i>I've been to many basements</i>

266
00:12:26.442 --> 00:12:29.972
where I've seen chickens
being slaughtered.


267
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.360
And it wasn't because they were
looking to cook the chicken.


268
00:12:35.712 --> 00:12:37.982
<i>Voodoo, some people</i> <i>they might think</i>

269
00:12:38.018 --> 00:12:39.458
it's like witchcraft and,
like, oh, my God,


270
00:12:39.498 --> 00:12:43.808
spells and stuff,
but no, Voodoo is religion.


271
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.720
<i>That was my</i> <i>grandmother's religion.</i>

272
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:48.245
<i>It wasn't anything crazy.</i>

273
00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:51.079
Voodoo is
a polytheistic religion,


274
00:12:51.118 --> 00:12:54.638
so it's a lot of channeling
people and ancestors


275
00:12:54.687 --> 00:12:57.427
<i>that may inspire you.</i>

276
00:12:59.997 --> 00:13:01.997
<i>But this was something,</i> <i>you know,</i>

277
00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:04.522
that I've never seen before.

278
00:13:04.567 --> 00:13:07.657
We have Frederick

279
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.310
with these papers

280
00:13:09.354 --> 00:13:12.404
that he's burning
and with this spell.


281
00:13:13.097 --> 00:13:14.927
<i>Based on the evidence</i> <i>before them,</i>

282
00:13:14.968 --> 00:13:17.838
<i>detectives consider</i> <i>a troubling conclusion.</i>

283
00:13:17.884 --> 00:13:20.584
It was like Frederick
was upset


284
00:13:20.626 --> 00:13:22.666
because his wife

285
00:13:22.715 --> 00:13:25.145
was some sort of
like a witch doctor.


286
00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:29.849
And because there was
no forced entry into the home,


287
00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:32.506
<i>we believe that</i> <i>whoever did this to Enda</i>

288
00:13:32.551 --> 00:13:33.941
<i>would have known her,</i>

289
00:13:33.987 --> 00:13:36.287
and the fact that Frederick

290
00:13:36.337 --> 00:13:37.897
was stating that
he was in the house


291
00:13:37.948 --> 00:13:39.818
at the time that this happened,

292
00:13:39.863 --> 00:13:43.303
it kind of raises
a lot of red flags for us.


293
00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:46.351
<i>Particularly in Brooklyn,</i>

294
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:48.221
over the years,
my detective squads


295
00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:50.352
have uncovered numerous
assaults and even homicides


296
00:13:50.395 --> 00:13:54.305
where the perp claimed to
have been influenced by Voodoo.


297
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:56.311
<i>Like any belief system,</i>

298
00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:59.927
<i>sometimes followers of Voodoo</i> <i>take things to extremes.</i>

299
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:03.281
We have to take this
development seriously.


300
00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:04.981
So our detectives
asked Frederick


301
00:14:05.018 --> 00:14:08.498
if they can interview him
at length at the 67 Precinct.


302
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.510
<i>He came willingly</i> <i>in the car.</i>

303
00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:15.029
<i>He was transported back,</i>

304
00:14:15.072 --> 00:14:17.072
so that when we get back
we can speak to him


305
00:14:17.117 --> 00:14:19.557
after going
through the location.


306
00:14:21.774 --> 00:14:23.734
The whole
Pierre-Jacques family


307
00:14:23.776 --> 00:14:25.556
is outside on Troy Avenue.

308
00:14:25.604 --> 00:14:27.394
I mean, we're about 20 deep.

309
00:14:27.432 --> 00:14:29.612
<i>When they all see</i> <i>the patriarch Frederick</i>

310
00:14:29.652 --> 00:14:32.262
<i>leaving in the squad car</i>
<i>to go to the precinct,</i>

311
00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:35.436
<i>a wave of worry</i> <i>crosses the crowd.</i>

312
00:14:35.484 --> 00:14:37.054
<i>Marjorie, she's like,</i>

313
00:14:37.094 --> 00:14:39.184
"They have Papa Frederick
locked up

00:14:39.226 --> 00:14:42.446
<i>because they think</i> <i>that he killed my mom."</i>

315
00:14:43.796 --> 00:14:45.966
And I was like,
"That's impossible."


316
00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:49.113
<i>The police officers,</i>

317
00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:51.059
they were definitely
talking to neighbors.


318
00:14:51.108 --> 00:14:53.198
<i>They definitely</i> <i>said that my grandparents</i>

319
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.200
weren't together really,

320
00:14:55.242 --> 00:14:56.942
and they did live
in separate rooms


321
00:14:56.983 --> 00:14:59.463
<i>and they really</i> <i>didn't speak much.</i>

322
00:15:02.032 --> 00:15:03.952
And neighbors
had an inclination


323
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.730
that Edna practiced Voodoo.

324
00:15:09.213 --> 00:15:12.563
I remember one time
growing up


325
00:15:12.608 --> 00:15:14.958
<i>I went to ask Edna,</i>

326
00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:16.961
<i>I said, "Mama Edna,</i>

327
00:15:17.003 --> 00:15:18.923
"the kids in the area

328
00:15:18.962 --> 00:15:21.442
said that
you practiced Voodoo."


329
00:15:21.486 --> 00:15:24.706
She's like, "My Jackie,
I'm gonna tell you one thing...


330
00:15:25.882 --> 00:15:29.232
<i>"Voodoo only takes you</i>

331
00:15:29.276 --> 00:15:31.796
if you believe in it."

332
00:15:31.844 --> 00:15:34.594
So because
of the conversations


333
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.110
that we had,

334
00:15:36.153 --> 00:15:39.113
<i>I believe that Edna was</i>
<i>some sort of spiritual healer.</i>

335
00:15:39.156 --> 00:15:41.766
<i>I believe that Frederick</i> <i>was upset</i>

336
00:15:41.811 --> 00:15:44.811
that his wife
was a spiritual healer


337
00:15:44.857 --> 00:15:47.077
or Voodoo witchdoctor,

338
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.820
<i>and he wanted to remove her</i>

339
00:15:50.863 --> 00:15:53.303
<i>from doing these spells</i> <i>on people.</i>

340
00:15:56.869 --> 00:15:58.609
<i>Before heading back</i> <i>to the precinct</i>

341
00:15:58.654 --> 00:16:00.394
<i>to interview Frederick,</i>

342
00:16:00.438 --> 00:16:02.268
<i>Detectives Figueroa and Alonzo</i>

343
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:04.789
<i>make one last turn</i> <i>of the house.</i>

344
00:16:04.834 --> 00:16:06.014
So at this time,

345
00:16:06.052 --> 00:16:08.012
we did another look
into the apartment.


346
00:16:08.054 --> 00:16:10.454
We kind of walked downstairs

347
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:12.711
<i>and made sure there</i>
<i>was no other forced entry</i>

348
00:16:12.755 --> 00:16:14.405
<i>to the apartment.</i>

349
00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:16.632
And when
we went into the basement,


350
00:16:16.672 --> 00:16:18.372
to our surprise,

351
00:16:18.412 --> 00:16:20.502
we located what we thought

352
00:16:20.545 --> 00:16:23.415
seemed to be like
an illegal gambling spot.


353
00:16:26.682 --> 00:16:28.292
<i>It wasn't something elaborate</i>

354
00:16:28.335 --> 00:16:30.505
<i>like you would find</i> <i>in Atlantic City,</i>

355
00:16:30.555 --> 00:16:32.855
<i>but you could tell</i> <i>that there was tables.</i>

356
00:16:32.905 --> 00:16:34.645
There was a couple
of slot machines.


357
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.170
There was chalkboards.

358
00:16:36.213 --> 00:16:38.873
<i>We saw a section of the room</i>

359
00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:41.041
that was sectioned off for,

360
00:16:41.087 --> 00:16:43.087
like, almost, like, an office

361
00:16:43.133 --> 00:16:45.403
<i>that had fax machines,</i>

362
00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:48.489
<i>cell phones,</i> <i>cash registers, calculators.</i>

363
00:16:49.922 --> 00:16:52.752
It was a full-fledged
gambling location.


364
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.930
<i>My team was still eager</i>

365
00:16:57.974 --> 00:17:00.414
<i>to question Edna's husband,</i> <i>Frederick,</i>

366
00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:02.504
<i>but this was</i> <i>a huge development.</i>

367
00:17:03.806 --> 00:17:05.066
New York City is home

368
00:17:05.111 --> 00:17:07.591
to countless underground
gambling operations.


369
00:17:07.636 --> 00:17:09.156
<i>More often than not,</i>

370
00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:10.992
<i>these establishments are</i> <i>settings for armed robberies,</i>

371
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.550
<i>assaults, and homicides.</i>

372
00:17:12.597 --> 00:17:14.857
<i>So finding one of
them</i> <i>beneath Edna's crime scene</i>

373
00:17:14.904 --> 00:17:18.524
presented us with a whole
new set of motives to consider.


374
00:17:20.779 --> 00:17:22.259
<i>Once we saw the basement,</i>

375
00:17:22.302 --> 00:17:25.742
<i>we knew that it
could</i> <i>have been a reason</i>

376
00:17:25.784 --> 00:17:27.094
why Edna was killed.

377
00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:28.873
Obviously,
with these gambling locations,


378
00:17:28.918 --> 00:17:32.658
there's a lot of money
being handed back and forth.


379
00:17:33.313 --> 00:17:36.753
<i>This could have been</i>
<i>a robbery that went bad,</i>

380
00:17:36.795 --> 00:17:39.485
or could it be somebody
coming to collect a debt?


381
00:17:39.537 --> 00:17:40.757
<i>We didn't know</i>

382
00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:42.929
<i>who was the owner</i>

383
00:17:42.975 --> 00:17:44.535
of that operation,

384
00:17:44.585 --> 00:17:46.935
<i>but we knew we
had to speak</i> <i>to Frederick</i>

385
00:17:46.979 --> 00:17:49.679
as urgently as possible.

386
00:17:59.992 --> 00:18:06.172
<i>♪</i>

387
00:18:06.216 --> 00:18:07.606
<i>NYPD detectives</i>

388
00:18:07.652 --> 00:18:10.262
<i>investigating the murder</i> <i>of Edna Pierre
-Jacques</i>

389
00:18:10.307 --> 00:18:12.737
<i>had just stumbled</i> <i>onto a gambling den</i>

390
00:18:12.788 --> 00:18:14.958
<i>in the basement of her home.</i>

391
00:18:15.007 --> 00:18:17.747
<i>While I had the basement</i> <i>processed for evidence,</i>

392
00:18:17.793 --> 00:18:20.233
<i>Detectives Figueroa</i> <i>and Alonso</i>

393
00:18:20.273 --> 00:18:21.623
<i>returned to the 67 Precinct</i>

394
00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:23.756
<i>to question Edna's husband</i> <i>Frederick.</i>

395
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.460
Frederick had
no problem speaking to us


396
00:18:28.499 --> 00:18:29.979
at our detective unit.

397
00:18:31.807 --> 00:18:34.157
We decided not to
question Frederick


398
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.770
about the Voodoo material
found in his room.


399
00:18:36.812 --> 00:18:38.942
<i>In the first hours</i> <i>of a homicide investigation,</i>

400
00:18:38.988 --> 00:18:41.208
<i>our priority</i> <i>is to keep a suspect</i>

401
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:42.991
<i>cooperative and talking.</i>

402
00:18:43.035 --> 00:18:45.465
<i>At this stage, we
didn't want</i> <i>Frederick to know</i>

403
00:18:45.516 --> 00:18:46.946
<i>we viewed him as a suspect,</i>

404
00:18:46.996 --> 00:18:48.996
<i>which could have caused him</i> <i>to lawyer up.</i>

405
00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:51.391
But we did go hard
asking about the gambling spot


406
00:18:51.435 --> 00:18:52.955
in the basement.

407
00:18:53.002 --> 00:18:55.052
<i>Frederick tells us</i> <i>that he rents</i>

408
00:18:55.091 --> 00:18:57.661
<i>the basement out to a person,</i>

409
00:18:57.702 --> 00:19:00.662
<i>and it's their operation.</i>

410
00:19:00.705 --> 00:19:02.785
The money that they get as rent

411
00:19:02.838 --> 00:19:05.928
<i>is what they use
to</i> <i>supplement paying the bills.</i>

412
00:19:06.972 --> 00:19:09.062
<i>He tells us</i> <i>it
was more of his wife</i>

413
00:19:09.105 --> 00:19:12.145
<i>that knew who this person was.</i>

414
00:19:12.195 --> 00:19:15.715
He was pretty much
just a silent partner.


415
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.810
<i>Frederick is still adamant</i>

416
00:19:17.853 --> 00:19:19.813
<i>that he had nothing
to do</i> <i>with Edna's death</i>

417
00:19:19.855 --> 00:19:21.635
<i>and that he didn't
see</i> <i>or hear a thing</i>

418
00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:23.822
<i>when she most likely</i> <i>was murdered.</i>

419
00:19:23.859 --> 00:19:27.429
My grandfather's TV
was always on 24/7.


420
00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:29.301
<i>He's always watching TV.</i>

421
00:19:29.342 --> 00:19:31.042
<i>His TV is always loud.</i>

422
00:19:31.083 --> 00:19:33.833
The walls are pretty thick
in that house as well,


423
00:19:33.869 --> 00:19:35.999
so if one thing
is going on in one room,


424
00:19:36.045 --> 00:19:38.955
it's a high chance
you're not going to hear it.


425
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.140
<i>By daybreak, detectives</i> <i>continue working on Frederick.</i>

426
00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:51.276
<i>Meanwhile, news of the
murder</i> <i>ripples across the city.</i>

427
00:19:51.887 --> 00:19:54.057
<i>East Flatbush neighbors
are still in shock about...</i>


428
00:19:54.106 --> 00:19:57.016
<i>Pierre
-Jacques was violently</i> <i>attacked inside her own home.</i>

429
00:19:57.066 --> 00:19:59.806
I walked around, make sure
all the doors were locked,


430
00:19:59.851 --> 00:20:01.901
<i>make sure the windows</i> <i>were locked.</i>

431
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.680
<i>Everyone was scared</i> <i>because you don't know</i>

432
00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:06.505
<i>what's happening</i> <i>on this block.</i>

433
00:20:09.687 --> 00:20:12.427
<i>After they brought him</i> <i>to the precinct,</i>

434
00:20:12.472 --> 00:20:14.002
they kept my grandfather

435
00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:16.429
for probably about that night

436
00:20:16.476 --> 00:20:18.996
and then the next full day.

437
00:20:20.132 --> 00:20:23.352
<i>But a full 24 hours</i> <i>into the investigation,</i>

438
00:20:23.396 --> 00:20:27.096
<i>everything Frederick has told</i> <i>detectives is corroborated.</i>

439
00:20:28.314 --> 00:20:32.064
<i>Investigators find no</i> <i>defensive wounds on his body,</i>

440
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:34.411
<i>and forensic testing</i> <i>reveals he never held</i>

441
00:20:34.451 --> 00:20:37.111
<i>the hammer or the wires</i> <i>that killed Edna.</i>

442
00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:40.982
<i>Frederick</i> <i>was incredibly cooperative.</i>

443
00:20:41.023 --> 00:20:45.073
He did nothing but speak to us
and help us.


444
00:20:45.114 --> 00:20:47.384
<i>And while the burnt
papers</i> <i>and book of spells</i>

445
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.810
<i>in Frederick's room</i>

446
00:20:48.857 --> 00:20:51.077
<i>might have initially suggested</i> <i>his involvement,</i>

447
00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.470
<i>the physical evidence</i> <i>says otherwise.</i>

448
00:20:55.124 --> 00:20:57.914
<i>In the end,</i> <i>detectives never find a need</i>

449
00:20:57.953 --> 00:21:01.433
<i>to question Frederick at all</i>
<i>about the items in his room.</i>

450
00:21:02.174 --> 00:21:05.134
After speaking with him,
we were satisfied


451
00:21:05.177 --> 00:21:09.267
that Mr. Frederick
was not a person of interest.


452
00:21:12.968 --> 00:21:16.148
<i>My grandfather</i> <i>is what you call</i>

453
00:21:16.188 --> 00:21:18.628
the epitome of a Caribbean man,

454
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:21.019
very strong,
don't show much emotion,


455
00:21:21.063 --> 00:21:24.503
<i>but that was the first
time</i> <i>I've seen him cry.</i>

456
00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:26.978
He let us know,

457
00:21:27.025 --> 00:21:29.505
"Our marriage
wasn't always like this."


458
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:32.249
They used to be very happy.

459
00:21:33.684 --> 00:21:35.644
<i>They had a lovely home,</i>

460
00:21:35.686 --> 00:21:38.596
<i>and Edna was the life</i> <i>of that house.</i>

461
00:21:38.645 --> 00:21:41.125
She brought life to that house.

462
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.390
You smell that coffee
every morning.


463
00:21:43.433 --> 00:21:44.873
<i>We smell her bread</i>

464
00:21:44.913 --> 00:21:47.133
<i>that she makes every morning.</i>

465
00:21:47.176 --> 00:21:49.436
<i>We hear the radio playing.</i>

466
00:21:50.222 --> 00:21:52.792
He still cared for her,
and we knew he still loved her.


467
00:21:54.226 --> 00:21:58.056
And my grandfather
felt helpless


468
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.750
from not being able

00:29:10.923 --> 00:29:13.103
"She's probably in shock
like we all are."


625
00:29:16.494 --> 00:29:18.844
Initially, no one gave
to Tamisha's strange behavior


626
00:29:18.888 --> 00:29:20.538
from that night
a second thought,


627
00:29:20.585 --> 00:29:23.715
<i>but according to family,</i> <i>Tamisha never returned home,</i>

628
00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:25.682
and no one has been able
to get a hold of her


629
00:29:25.721 --> 00:29:27.681
or her boyfriend ever since.

630
00:29:27.723 --> 00:29:29.733
<i>Now two days</i> <i>into the investigation,</i>

631
00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.808
<i>Edna's family</i> <i>is starting to wonder</i>

632
00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:34.897
<i>if Tamisha knows something</i> <i>about the murder.</i>

633
00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:39.739
Well, it was kind of odd

634
00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:42.128
when we learned
that Tamisha wasn't home,


635
00:29:42.172 --> 00:29:44.782
and she wasn't answering
anyone's phone calls.


636
00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:48.438
<i>You don't really pack up</i> <i>and leave</i>

637
00:29:48.483 --> 00:29:50.753
and disappear out of nowhere.

638
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:52.139
It's not a common thing to do

639
00:29:52.182 --> 00:29:54.792
when you're considered
part of the family,


640
00:29:54.837 --> 00:29:58.277
<i>and Edna</i> <i>was just brutally murdered</i>

641
00:29:58.318 --> 00:30:00.798
and you're nowhere
to be found now.


642
00:30:00.843 --> 00:30:03.023
<i>What would spook someone</i>

643
00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:04.852
<i>to just disappear</i> <i>out of nowhere</i>

644
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.460
<i>and not answer</i> <i>phone calls now?</i>

645
00:30:07.502 --> 00:30:08.942
What is she afraid of?

646
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:10.941
What did she see?

647
00:30:13.246 --> 00:30:14.596
<i>A panic sets in</i>

648
00:30:14.639 --> 00:30:17.469
<i>because Tamisha was with Edna</i>

649
00:30:17.512 --> 00:30:19.042
before the murder,

650
00:30:19.078 --> 00:30:20.558
so there's a possibility

651
00:30:20.602 --> 00:30:22.822
that Tamisha
may be in danger as well.


652
00:30:23.779 --> 00:30:26.349
<i>We thought</i> <i>that Tamisha had fled</i>

653
00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.740
<i>because maybe</i> <i>she saw something</i>

654
00:30:27.783 --> 00:30:29.483
<i>she wasn't supposed to see.</i>

655
00:30:29.524 --> 00:30:30.794
<i>Now she's scared for her life.</i>

656
00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:32.829
She's scared for her safety.

657
00:30:36.661 --> 00:30:38.491
<i>Hoping to get a bead</i> <i>on Tamisha,</i>

658
00:30:38.533 --> 00:30:41.493
<i>detectives attempt</i> <i>to locate her boyfriend,</i>

659
00:30:41.536 --> 00:30:45.406
<i>but his whereabouts</i> <i>are equally unknown.</i>

660
00:30:45.453 --> 00:30:47.323
That now brings up

661
00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:51.327
another question
in our investigation.


662
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:53.161
Is Tamisha afraid of him?

663
00:30:53.199 --> 00:30:55.899
I didn't know much
about Tamisha's boyfriend.


664
00:30:55.941 --> 00:30:58.421
I didn't even know
what he looked like at all.


665
00:30:59.031 --> 00:31:01.641
<i>I probably seen him</i> <i>once or twice,</i>

666
00:31:01.686 --> 00:31:03.376
but I never spoke with him.

667
00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.950
<i>We're trying</i> <i>to connect all the dots.</i>

668
00:31:07.997 --> 00:31:09.737
Did the boyfriend
have something to do


669
00:31:09.781 --> 00:31:12.041
with Edna's death?

670
00:31:12.088 --> 00:31:15.128
Was Tamisha taken
against her will?


671
00:31:26.363 --> 00:31:30.543
<i>♪</i>

672
00:31:30.585 --> 00:31:32.715
Two days had passed since
Edna Pierre-Jacques


673
00:31:32.761 --> 00:31:35.421
was found strangled to death
in her East Flatbush home.


674
00:31:35.459 --> 00:31:37.329
It was then that my detectives
found out


675
00:31:37.374 --> 00:31:38.684
the last person
sitting with Edna,


676
00:31:38.723 --> 00:31:41.903
<i>her best friend and neighbor,</i> <i>Tamisha Harper,</i>

677
00:31:41.944 --> 00:31:43.384
<i>had gone missing.</i>

678
00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:44.823
And according to Edna's family,

679
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.730
Tamisha's boyfriend
was also nowhere to be found.


680
00:31:51.388 --> 00:31:52.428
We didn't know what to think,

681
00:31:52.476 --> 00:31:54.566
but we needed
to speak to Tamisha.


682
00:31:56.001 --> 00:31:58.441
We're trying to locate her

683
00:31:58.482 --> 00:32:01.962
through her phone,
but her phone is off.


684
00:32:02.007 --> 00:32:04.577
We spoke to where she worked.

685
00:32:04.619 --> 00:32:06.269
She was highly regarded,

686
00:32:06.316 --> 00:32:08.536
<i>an exemplary employee.</i>

687
00:32:08.579 --> 00:32:11.499
She was never late,
always on time.


688
00:32:11.539 --> 00:32:13.539
<i>But detectives learned</i>

689
00:32:13.584 --> 00:32:15.374
<i>that Tamisha</i> <i>hasn't shown up to work</i>

690
00:32:15.412 --> 00:32:17.282
<i>since the day</i> <i>of Edna's murder.</i>

691
00:32:17.327 --> 00:32:19.327
<i>We conduct computer checks,</i>

692
00:32:19.372 --> 00:32:22.772
and we've knocked
at every door in Brooklyn,


693
00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:26.211
every address
that she's used in the past--


694
00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:28.559
everything led to negative results.

695
00:32:29.513 --> 00:32:32.603
<i>We then found a address</i> <i>in New Jersey.</i>

696
00:32:32.647 --> 00:32:35.347
It was probably
the last location


697
00:32:35.388 --> 00:32:37.608
that we had on file for her.

698
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:42.607
<i>Three days after Edna's</i>
<i>murder on March 2, 2017,</i>

699
00:32:42.657 --> 00:32:45.697
<i>detectives drive across</i> <i>the Verrazano Bridge</i>

700
00:32:45.747 --> 00:32:48.877
<i>through Staten Island</i> <i>and into New Jersey.</i>

701
00:32:51.056 --> 00:32:52.226
<i>It was a quiet block.</i>

702
00:32:52.275 --> 00:32:55.185
We walk up to the address,
ring the bell,


703
00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:56.714
and a lady opens the door.

704
00:32:56.758 --> 00:33:00.408
We identify ourselves as
New York City Police Detectives


705
00:33:00.457 --> 00:33:02.937
looking for Tamisha Harper.

706
00:33:03.808 --> 00:33:07.548
<i>The lady tells us</i>
<i>that Tamisha was her daughter</i>

707
00:33:07.595 --> 00:33:09.765
and that she was in the house.

708
00:33:11.773 --> 00:33:16.043
So Tamisha's mother points us
to her living room.


709
00:33:16.691 --> 00:33:19.741
<i>And as we're walking</i> <i>into the house,</i>

710
00:33:19.781 --> 00:33:21.351
<i>getting close</i> <i>to the living room,</i>

711
00:33:21.391 --> 00:33:23.311
<i>we noticed that the area</i> <i>was dim.</i>

712
00:33:23.349 --> 00:33:25.699
<i>It was sort of dark.</i>

713
00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.825
So as we get closer,

714
00:33:29.878 --> 00:33:32.318
I see Tamisha

715
00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:35.798
<i>almost like in a...</i> <i>fetal position.</i>

716
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.630
<i>It looked like</i> <i>she hasn't slept for days.</i>

717
00:33:40.323 --> 00:33:43.023
She had this blank stare

718
00:33:43.065 --> 00:33:44.495
in her eyes.

719
00:33:44.544 --> 00:33:47.554
Her hair...her hair
was all over the place,


720
00:33:47.591 --> 00:33:49.811
almost like it
hasn't been combed in days.


721
00:33:50.376 --> 00:33:52.726
<i>Tamisha had a look</i> <i>on her face.</i>

722
00:33:54.076 --> 00:33:56.166
It wasn't a person who looked

723
00:33:56.208 --> 00:33:58.078
that they were scared.

724
00:33:58.123 --> 00:34:00.823
It just--it was kind of
hard to describe,


725
00:34:00.865 --> 00:34:03.555
<i>like, a million-mile stare</i> <i>right through us.</i>

726
00:34:04.913 --> 00:34:08.053
<i>So we introduce ourselves</i> <i>to Tamisha.</i>

727
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.440
We say that we're there

728
00:34:09.482 --> 00:34:11.662
because we're investigating
the murder of Edna.


729
00:34:13.008 --> 00:34:15.838
And it was almost after we said
the name Edna, you know,


730
00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.710
her body just started to rock.

731
00:34:18.753 --> 00:34:21.323
She was, again,
in this fetal position,


732
00:34:21.364 --> 00:34:24.284
just rocking back and forth.

733
00:34:25.542 --> 00:34:28.332
<i>Her motion and her demeanor</i>

734
00:34:28.371 --> 00:34:30.331
<i>and her appearance</i>

735
00:34:30.373 --> 00:34:31.503
told me
that she knew something.


736
00:34:31.548 --> 00:34:35.898
She knew
what had happened to Edna.


737
00:34:38.468 --> 00:34:40.558
We asked her

738
00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.910
if she could walk us through
what happened that day.


739
00:34:44.474 --> 00:34:46.044
<i>Tamisha dives into a story</i>

740
00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:49.704
<i>that begins</i> <i>weeks before Edna's murder.</i>

741
00:34:51.002 --> 00:34:52.832
<i>She claims a woman</i> <i>from the neighborhood</i>

742
00:34:52.874 --> 00:34:55.354
<i>became worried</i> <i>that her boyfriend</i>

743
00:34:55.398 --> 00:34:56.918
<i>might be interested</i> <i>in Tamisha,</i>

744
00:34:56.965 --> 00:35:01.005
<i>and the woman was
a devout</i> <i>practitioner of Voodoo.</i>

745
00:35:02.797 --> 00:35:04.757
<i>Tamisha says</i> <i>she found out that this woman</i>

746
00:35:04.799 --> 00:35:09.019
put some sort of,
like, curse on Tamisha...


747
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.550
And once she found that out,

748
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.380
<i>she sought the help of Edna,</i>

749
00:35:16.419 --> 00:35:19.119
<i>who was a spiritual healer</i>

750
00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:21.211
and good in removing

751
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.690
bad demons from people.

752
00:35:24.819 --> 00:35:27.819
<i>She knew that Edna</i> <i>was practicing Voodoo.</i>

753
00:35:28.866 --> 00:35:31.736
She said that Edna agreed
to help her.


754
00:35:35.394 --> 00:35:37.404
On the day of Edna's death,

755
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.830
she had came over
for her services.


756
00:35:41.661 --> 00:35:44.581
She states
that everything was fine


757
00:35:44.621 --> 00:35:47.801
and that her and Edna
had a conversation,


758
00:35:47.842 --> 00:35:51.372
which led us to believe that
that's when Shakira came by.


759
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.200
<i>Tamisha claims she went home</i>

760
00:35:53.238 --> 00:35:55.588
<i>soon after Shakira left.</i>

761
00:35:55.632 --> 00:35:56.982
Tamisha also said

762
00:35:57.025 --> 00:35:59.415
that she was feeling
under the weather a little bit


763
00:35:59.462 --> 00:36:00.902
and that she went back home

764
00:36:00.942 --> 00:36:02.772
<i>and agreed</i> <i>to come back later on</i>

765
00:36:02.813 --> 00:36:05.083
<i>because Enda</i> <i>was gonna help her.</i>

766
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.730
<i>Edna would do certain stuff,</i>
<i>and she called it work.</i>

767
00:36:08.776 --> 00:36:11.126
<i>It was the word
that she used,</i> <i>the terminology.</i>

768
00:36:15.478 --> 00:36:17.828
She doesn't
know the exact time,


769
00:36:17.872 --> 00:36:20.482
but a few hours later
she comes back to Edna's house.


770
00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:24.530
<i>But this time she says</i>
<i>that she was coughing a lot.</i>

771
00:36:24.574 --> 00:36:27.754
She described it
as a nasty cough.


772
00:36:27.795 --> 00:36:30.795
And then Edna says,
"You've been touched.


773
00:36:32.234 --> 00:36:34.154
The spirits are in you."

774
00:36:36.499 --> 00:36:39.369
So at which point my partner
and I,


775
00:36:39.415 --> 00:36:40.975
we look at each other.

776
00:36:41.025 --> 00:36:44.025
<i>We asked her,</i> <i>"What does that mean?"</i>

777
00:36:44.072 --> 00:36:46.682
She said that, "Someone did
some work against me,


778
00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:48.116

straight at her face and says,
"You're here to hurt me."

And Tamisha laughs it off,

783
00:37:03.613 --> 00:37:05.623

"No, you're like a mom to me.

788
00:37:19.107 --> 00:37:21.717
