1
00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:08.004
My, what a surprise!

2
00:03:08.213 --> 00:03:09.772
It's been a while.

3
00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:11.506
It's turned quite cold.

4
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.514
Indeed.

5
00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:18.783
Visiting this area today?

6
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.092
Yes.
I come occasionally.


7
00:03:22.298 --> 00:03:26.395
The new branch manager
drops in a lot.


8
00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:29.574
Really?
Okabe likes to drink too.


9
00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:34.645
You're just in time: I just got
some salted sea cucumber from home.


10
00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:37.215
Sounds good.

11
00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:39.284
Some warm sake, please.

12
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.721
- I'd like some too.
- What?


13
00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:47.625
Salted sea cucumber.
And more hot sake.


14
00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.134
As soon as I get
to know you people,


15
00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:57.300
the head office
calls you back.


16
00:03:57.512 --> 00:03:58.774
It's true.

17
00:03:59.147 --> 00:04:03.745
But since it means
a promotion...


18
00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:06.655
Where's Akemi?

19
00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:10.386
She went skiing with friends.

20
00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:13.494
Other side of the Shimizu tunnel,

21
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.366
where the snow piles
up 350 kilometers high.


22
00:04:18.573 --> 00:04:24.536
That's how far it is to Nagoya.
You must mean centimeters.


23
00:04:24.748 --> 00:04:28.378
Is that what it is?
Silly me.


24
00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:32.320
Has your daughter
gone already?


25
00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:35.393
Not yet, but she
probably will soon.


26
00:04:36.698 --> 00:04:41.363
I also got some Matoya oysters.
Want some?


27
00:04:41.571 --> 00:04:43.038
Sounds good.

28
00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:44.537
Any special way?

29
00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:46.573
Afterward, with rice gruel.

30
00:04:46.777 --> 00:04:47.904
Okay.

31
00:04:48.547 --> 00:04:51.108
I'd like some oysters too.

32
00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:54.344
With vinegar.
Also afterward, with rice gruel.


33
00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:55.544
Okay.

34
00:04:55.756 --> 00:04:58.783
- I'll try them with vinegar too.
- You too?


35
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.237
Sure is cold.

36
00:05:07.438 --> 00:05:09.168
It really is.

37
00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.480
Tastes good, with a nice smell.
Are you from the Shima peninsula?


38
00:05:20.623 --> 00:05:22.921
Yes. Anori.

39
00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:25.891
You don't say!

40
00:05:26.096 --> 00:05:30.535
My brother-in-law
is from Nakiri nearby.


41
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.762
Do you know that area?

42
00:05:33.273 --> 00:05:37.608
Not too well,
but I once went to Kashiko Island.


43
00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:41.682
Nice place.
You in the pearl business?


44
00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:46.380
No, I'm actually a banker.

45
00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:48.818
The sea's so blue there.

46
00:05:49.227 --> 00:05:51.594
And deep too.

47
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:56.966
I took a ferry tour
around the whole island.


48
00:05:57.605 --> 00:06:01.167
Pearls need a place like that

49
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.608
in order to grow naturally.

50
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.691
The late Mr. Mikimoto
sure found the right spot.


51
00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:15.259
You're right.

52
00:06:15.896 --> 00:06:18.024
Mr. Sugiyama...

53
00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:23.867
Professor Numata was here
very late a few nights ago.


54
00:06:24.074 --> 00:06:26.168
Is that so? Alone?

55
00:06:26.377 --> 00:06:28.938
No, with two students.

56
00:06:29.348 --> 00:06:32.944
He was already drunk
when he got here.


57
00:06:33.887 --> 00:06:34.980
I see.

58
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:40.150
The students
were escorting him home.


59
00:06:40.362 --> 00:06:42.991
- Did he cause trouble?
- Oh, no.


60
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.725
Not at all.

61
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.236
Does he come in often?

62
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.638
No, just once in a while.

63
00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:54.104
He forgot that hat.

64
00:06:57.352 --> 00:06:59.719
He'll be back for it, I'm sure.

65
00:07:04.027 --> 00:07:06.462
Have one on me.

66
00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:09.596
Thank you.

67
00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:01.232
I'm home.

68
00:08:10.015 --> 00:08:11.506
Welcome home.

69
00:08:11.718 --> 00:08:13.117
Oh, you're here.

70
00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.912
Cold, isn't it?

71
00:08:20.563 --> 00:08:21.655
Where's Tomizawa?

72
00:08:21.864 --> 00:08:23.457
I sent her home.

73
00:08:24.268 --> 00:08:25.827
She's sound asleep.

74
00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.714
When did you get here?

75
00:08:37.051 --> 00:08:39.520
This afternoon.
Do you want supper?


76
00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:40.754
I ate.

77
00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:42.288
Oh.

78
00:09:01.551 --> 00:09:03.451
<i>Have you seen my tabi?</i>

79
00:09:07.092 --> 00:09:09.287
- Where could they be?
- They're not around?


80
00:09:09.494 --> 00:09:13.830
Tomizawa must've washed them.
Check the bottom drawer.


81
00:09:29.388 --> 00:09:30.855
I found them.

82
00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:39.433
How's Numata?

83
00:09:41.471 --> 00:09:43.064
He's fine.

84
00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:47.177
I read one of his
magazine articles recently:


85
00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:49.405
"Resistance to Freedom."

86
00:09:50.883 --> 00:09:51.976
Is that so?

87
00:09:52.185 --> 00:09:57.146
Quite interesting.
Does he get asked to write often?


88
00:10:01.498 --> 00:10:04.229
Is everything okay?
- With what?


89
00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:06.027
At your place.

90
00:10:07.272 --> 00:10:09.240
Shall I make tea?

91
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:11.410
Come and warm yourself.

92
00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:16.482
Isn't it late?

93
00:10:16.684 --> 00:10:19.245
It doesn't matter.

94
00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:23.286
- He got home late the other night.
- When?


95
00:10:23.493 --> 00:10:24.859
And drunk, no less.

96
00:10:25.062 --> 00:10:27.462
He does that often.

97
00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:32.266
- He drinks that much?
- Yes, these days.


98
00:10:34.108 --> 00:10:37.636
Something seems
to be bothering him.


99
00:10:38.613 --> 00:10:39.580
What?

100
00:10:44.822 --> 00:10:48.156
- Welcome home.
- You're home too?


101
00:10:48.694 --> 00:10:52.153
- Takako, I prepared your bed.
- Thanks.


102
00:10:54.501 --> 00:10:57.062
Akiko, have some tea.

103
00:10:57.573 --> 00:10:59.268
No, thanks.

104
00:11:00.643 --> 00:11:02.133
You're not going home?

105
00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:03.608
No.

106
00:11:03.814 --> 00:11:05.441
Why not?

107
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.928
Has something happened again?

108
00:11:16.264 --> 00:11:17.788
What's wrong?

109
00:11:21.036 --> 00:11:23.733
Something between
you and Numata?


110
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.636
That's not good.

111
00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:31.350
Shall I make your bed, Father?

112
00:11:35.256 --> 00:11:37.088
It can't be helped.

113
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.759
Takako,
come and sit down.


114
00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.236
What is it?

115
00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:57.748
- Never mind. Just leave me alone.
- But --


116
00:11:57.953 --> 00:12:00.980
That's just how he is.

117
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.487
How he is?

118
00:12:02.692 --> 00:12:07.495
It's a sickness.
He gets so irritable.


119
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.793
He takes it out
on poor Michiko.


120
00:12:13.807 --> 00:12:18.837
If his friends get good reviews,
or there's trouble at school --


121
00:12:19.048 --> 00:12:21.415
- But what's that got to do with you?
- That's it.


122
00:12:21.618 --> 00:12:23.552
He's just neurotic.

123
00:12:26.757 --> 00:12:28.419
I'll go and see him.

124
00:12:28.627 --> 00:12:32.587
It won't help,
and you'll only get upset.


125
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.867
That's how he is.

126
00:12:49.388 --> 00:12:53.223
BANK

127
00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:17.057
You have a visitor.

128
00:13:22.132 --> 00:13:24.226
- Hello.
- Hi there.


129
00:13:25.703 --> 00:13:26.762
What's wrong?

130
00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.440
Just stopped in to see
about a loan.


131
00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:37.141
Did you have lunch yet?

132
00:13:37.352 --> 00:13:39.651
Not yet.

133
00:13:39.855 --> 00:13:41.482
I have an idea.

134
00:13:48.734 --> 00:13:52.432
The Towa director's funeral
is the day after tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.


135
00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:55.404
1:00 p.m.?
At Seishoji temple?


136
00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:05.550
Ever gone to that restaurant
around the corner?


137
00:14:06.391 --> 00:14:07.187
Which one?

138
00:14:07.392 --> 00:14:08.883
Nice place.
Has good food.


139
00:14:09.095 --> 00:14:10.187
Which one?

140
00:14:10.396 --> 00:14:12.160
They serve broiled eel.

141
00:14:13.366 --> 00:14:15.062
Are you free now?

142
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:17.294
Yes. Let's go.

143
00:14:17.506 --> 00:14:19.167
My treat.

144
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.541
All right.

145
00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:40.264
I'm going out.

146
00:14:40.469 --> 00:14:44.430
I'll be back by 2:00.
Please handle any phone calls.


147
00:14:46.544 --> 00:14:49.673
Excuse me.
Where's the washroom?


148
00:14:49.882 --> 00:14:52.374
Down the hall on the right.

149
00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:12.371
THE EEL

150
00:15:18.687 --> 00:15:20.417
Thank you.

151
00:15:24.128 --> 00:15:26.495
Broiled eel
and eel liver soup.


152
00:15:26.965 --> 00:15:28.899
How about some sake?

153
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.500
Not during the day.

154
00:15:30.703 --> 00:15:32.365
Why not? One bottle.

155
00:15:33.173 --> 00:15:35.438
And one order of liver.

156
00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.272
- May I make a phone call?
- Certainly.


157
00:15:46.657 --> 00:15:48.125
Good afternoon.

158
00:15:56.605 --> 00:15:58.766
Hello? Mr. Chu?

159
00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:03.041
I'm in Gofukubashi,
the usual place.


160
00:16:03.247 --> 00:16:05.978
Let me talk to Mr. Shinoda.

161
00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:09.111
Mr. Shinoda? It's me.

162
00:16:10.222 --> 00:16:12.191
Everything went fine
at the bank.


163
00:16:12.392 --> 00:16:16.352
So go ahead as planned.
Yes, that's right.


164
00:16:16.564 --> 00:16:18.260
Yes, please.

165
00:16:18.467 --> 00:16:19.525
Thank you.

166
00:16:22.438 --> 00:16:24.839
Wait a second --
Oh, never mind.


167
00:16:26.578 --> 00:16:28.603
What a pain!

168
00:16:31.584 --> 00:16:33.553
Doing business
is such a bother.


169
00:16:33.754 --> 00:16:35.586
You seem busy.

170
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:39.891
Well, when it's
your own business...


171
00:16:40.362 --> 00:16:42.763
Listen, what about
Father's 12-year memorial service?


172
00:16:42.966 --> 00:16:44.992
What should we do?

173
00:16:45.336 --> 00:16:49.832
No need to attend.
I'll send money to the temple.


174
00:16:50.043 --> 00:16:51.840
Would you?

175
00:16:52.045 --> 00:16:53.104
Sure.

176
00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:57.141
A thousand ought to be enough.
- Plenty.


177
00:16:57.352 --> 00:16:59.412
By the way,
how's Akiko doing?


178
00:16:59.822 --> 00:17:01.050
Why?

179
00:17:01.257 --> 00:17:06.196
She came to the house
asking to borrow some money.


180
00:17:06.864 --> 00:17:09.459
- When?
- A few days ago.


181
00:17:09.735 --> 00:17:15.232
The day I stopped by our suppliers,
so it was Tuesday.


182
00:17:15.443 --> 00:17:16.570
Did she say why?

183
00:17:16.778 --> 00:17:21.148
No. She told me not to tell you.
She wanted 5,000.


184
00:17:21.617 --> 00:17:23.245
And you gave it to her?

185
00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:25.980
Without knowing what for?
Of course not.


186
00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:32.421
Listen, I think it would be wise
to find her a husband soon.


187
00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:38.798
Thank you for waiting.

188
00:17:40.442 --> 00:17:42.274
Pardon me.

189
00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:45.382
Some pickles too.

190
00:17:48.854 --> 00:17:50.447
Have some sake.

191
00:17:57.165 --> 00:18:00.499
Why wouldn't she tell me
the reason? How odd.


192
00:18:05.076 --> 00:18:09.707
That's a lot of money for her.
Something fishy's going on.


193
00:18:10.884 --> 00:18:12.511
What did she do?

194
00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:14.381
She said never mind and left.

195
00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:18.286
She never told me.

196
00:18:18.493 --> 00:18:20.121
That's what I thought.

197
00:18:20.663 --> 00:18:24.225
What on earth are young people
thinking these days?


198
00:18:24.768 --> 00:18:27.169
Hurry and marry her off.

199
00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:31.538
Perhaps I should.

200
00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:34.374
I'll start looking
for a match right away.


201
00:18:34.582 --> 00:18:37.245
It should be easy.
She's a pretty girl.


202
00:18:38.887 --> 00:18:41.118
More sake?

203
00:19:02.185 --> 00:19:04.654
AIOI
-SO APARTMENTS

204
00:19:37.666 --> 00:19:39.065
Who's there?

205
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.565
Oh, it's you.

206
00:19:42.772 --> 00:19:47.006
You spoiled a great hand.
I could have won.


207
00:19:47.212 --> 00:19:48.645
I'm sorry.

208
00:19:48.848 --> 00:19:51.681
You came just in time
to save me.


209
00:19:52.452 --> 00:19:54.887
Forget it. Come in.

210
00:20:00.362 --> 00:20:02.991
Do you know where Kenji is?

211
00:20:03.768 --> 00:20:06.601
He's not in?
Maybe at school.


212
00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:09.273
Would he go to school
on a nice day like this?


213
00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:11.568
Or even when it's raining?

214
00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:13.474
You guys have it easy.

215
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:16.276
Poor fathers
who pay for it all.


216
00:20:16.484 --> 00:20:18.008
Lock the door.

217
00:20:23.093 --> 00:20:28.055
What a hand.
Am I dealer? I fold.


218
00:20:28.267 --> 00:20:31.499
- So just us two?
- All right, I'm in.


219
00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:41.983
No idea at all where he is?

220
00:20:42.953 --> 00:20:44.887
Who? You mean Kenji?

221
00:20:47.058 --> 00:20:49.994
Don't be so tough on him.

222
00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:51.590
What?

223
00:20:52.165 --> 00:20:54.133
He's lost weight.

224
00:20:55.903 --> 00:20:59.567
What do you like
so much about him anyway?


225
00:21:00.977 --> 00:21:02.103
I don't know.

226
00:21:02.312 --> 00:21:04.406
Of course you do.

227
00:21:05.516 --> 00:21:08.680
What makes him so attractive?

228
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:10.983
Don't be so nosy.

229
00:21:11.758 --> 00:21:13.920
Actually, I know.

230
00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:16.931
I know all about it.

231
00:21:18.099 --> 00:21:21.160
Hey, Akiko, I met
some old lady who knows you.


232
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:22.269
Who?

233
00:21:22.839 --> 00:21:24.501
Oh, shoot!

234
00:21:24.709 --> 00:21:25.676
Who?

235
00:21:25.877 --> 00:21:28.073
- She runs a mahjong parlor.
- Where?


236
00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.180
- In Gotanda.
- What's her name?


237
00:21:30.383 --> 00:21:33.444
Hey, what was that
mahjong place called?


238
00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:35.552
Kotobuki
-So.

239
00:21:35.756 --> 00:21:37.247
Never been there.

240
00:21:37.659 --> 00:21:40.026
She was asking all about you.

241
00:21:41.197 --> 00:21:43.792
Maybe she confused me
with someone else.


242
00:21:44.968 --> 00:21:46.698
She knew you well.

243
00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:48.939
How could she?

244
00:21:54.182 --> 00:21:57.414
Game!
Hand it over.


245
00:21:57.619 --> 00:21:59.246
I'll be going.

246
00:21:59.555 --> 00:22:01.956
Sorry we couldn't
be more help.


247
00:22:02.158 --> 00:22:05.788
- Lock the door after me.
- Leave us some cigs.


248
00:22:10.336 --> 00:22:11.701
So long.

249
00:23:07.078 --> 00:23:10.879
Sorry.
I don't have much to offer.


250
00:23:20.296 --> 00:23:21.764
Please have some.

251
00:23:25.369 --> 00:23:29.534
Father, try these.
They might be a bit harsh.


252
00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:35.907
Busy at work these days?

253
00:23:37.152 --> 00:23:38.745
Not too busy.

254
00:23:39.355 --> 00:23:45.762
My problem is finding books
that need translating.


255
00:23:49.201 --> 00:23:52.035
This hit the Maruzen shelves
a few days ago.


256
00:23:52.339 --> 00:23:55.366
I found out today at school
that someone's already doing it.


257
00:23:55.576 --> 00:23:57.545
They beat me to it.

258
00:24:01.217 --> 00:24:03.209
I've come about Takako.

259
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.910
Really?

260
00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:09.018
And how's Michiko?
Being a nuisance?


261
00:24:09.228 --> 00:24:12.130
I don't feel that way.

262
00:24:12.499 --> 00:24:17.199
They say it's easier to love
your grandchildren than your children.


263
00:24:17.405 --> 00:24:21.104
What do you think, Father?
I don't believe that.


264
00:24:32.292 --> 00:24:35.319
People may think it's easier...

265
00:24:36.364 --> 00:24:39.129
but that's not real love.

266
00:24:40.536 --> 00:24:44.634
Can love, so to speak,

267
00:24:44.976 --> 00:24:49.641
skip a generation like that?
I don't think so.


268
00:24:50.115 --> 00:24:52.676
If it does, it's a tragedy.

269
00:24:53.321 --> 00:24:57.622
Love between
parent and child


270
00:24:57.826 --> 00:25:00.125
is the most primitive
instinct of all.


271
00:25:01.297 --> 00:25:02.697
About Takako --

272
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.362
Oh, right.

273
00:25:05.069 --> 00:25:06.537
What's going on?

274
00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:09.667
Did she say something?

275
00:25:10.142 --> 00:25:12.338
Nothing specific.

276
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.712
Two nights ago
she suddenly said


277
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:23.485
that she wanted
to think things over.


278
00:25:25.429 --> 00:25:28.126
When I woke up,
she was gone.


279
00:25:29.369 --> 00:25:33.466
I'd been working all night
and woke up late.


280
00:25:36.478 --> 00:25:37.968
A drink?

281
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.011
Not for me.

282
00:25:46.658 --> 00:25:49.856
Japanese whiskey has improved.

283
00:25:52.065 --> 00:25:54.728
It's snowing.

284
00:25:55.436 --> 00:25:57.302
I didn't expect that.

285
00:26:14.796 --> 00:26:16.263
<i>I'm back.</i>

286
00:26:20.603 --> 00:26:23.129
Welcome home.
Get caught in the snow?


287
00:26:24.308 --> 00:26:28.507
It may pile up.
I didn't see it coming.


288
00:26:28.714 --> 00:26:30.478
Your coat's all wet.

289
00:26:35.724 --> 00:26:37.555
I saw Numata.

290
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.125
I see.

291
00:26:39.395 --> 00:26:40.920
Where's Michiko?

292
00:26:41.131 --> 00:26:44.329
I just tucked her in.
She didn't have her nap today.


293
00:26:44.535 --> 00:26:47.232
I see.
Cold, isn't it?


294
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.641
Anyway, about Numata --

295
00:26:55.516 --> 00:26:57.007
Just a sec.

296
00:27:51.424 --> 00:27:54.622
Wasn't it awkward?

297
00:27:54.829 --> 00:27:56.263
What?

298
00:27:56.565 --> 00:27:58.032
Meeting with him.

299
00:27:58.233 --> 00:27:59.792
Of course not.

300
00:28:00.503 --> 00:28:01.402
But --

301
00:28:01.805 --> 00:28:06.675
But he's changed.
He wasn't like that before.


302
00:28:06.978 --> 00:28:09.447
He used to be more cheerful.

303
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:15.880
I was thinking on the train home
that I owe you an apology.


304
00:28:16.391 --> 00:28:19.418
For what? Not at all.

305
00:28:19.863 --> 00:28:24.563
I should have
let you marry Sato.


306
00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:29.607
You seemed to like him.

307
00:28:30.376 --> 00:28:33.346
It doesn't matter now, Father.

308
00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:38.916
I pressured you
into marrying Numata.


309
00:28:40.523 --> 00:28:42.491
I'll check the bath.

310
00:28:59.482 --> 00:29:00.949
I'm home.

311
00:29:15.469 --> 00:29:16.334
What?

312
00:29:16.571 --> 00:29:18.232
Come here.

313
00:29:21.177 --> 00:29:22.076
What?

314
00:29:22.279 --> 00:29:24.770
Did you ask
your aunt for money?


315
00:29:25.684 --> 00:29:26.446
Yes.

316
00:29:26.651 --> 00:29:28.552
Why didn't you tell me?

317
00:29:31.124 --> 00:29:33.058
What was it for?

318
00:29:33.593 --> 00:29:36.119
It doesn't matter now.

319
00:29:39.134 --> 00:29:40.693
Come here.

320
00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:47.771
What was it for?

321
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.744
A friend was in trouble.

322
00:29:49.949 --> 00:29:52.316
You could have asked me.

323
00:29:52.653 --> 00:29:54.245
It came up suddenly.

324
00:29:54.455 --> 00:29:55.923
What did?

325
00:29:56.124 --> 00:30:00.528
You weren't around.
I didn't know where you were.


326
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:02.358
I don't need it anymore.

327
00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:15.473
Your bath is ready, Father.
I took the cover off.


328
00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:21.420
What did Akiko do?

329
00:30:26.064 --> 00:30:28.226
She's just being difficult.

330
00:31:19.235 --> 00:31:22.364
THIS WAY TO KOTOBUKI
-SO

331
00:31:40.597 --> 00:31:43.089
KOTOBUKI
-SO

332
00:31:48.307 --> 00:31:50.207
This hasn't been discarded yet.

333
00:31:51.211 --> 00:31:53.771
Nor this.
I guess it's safe.


334
00:31:53.981 --> 00:31:58.682
Pon! Three doubles.
That's 9,600 points.


335
00:31:59.522 --> 00:32:01.354
You're lucky today, Yakko.

336
00:32:01.558 --> 00:32:03.993
The game's just starting.

337
00:32:04.328 --> 00:32:07.230
I lost the most.
My luck's rotten today.


338
00:32:14.742 --> 00:32:16.643
Hey, pops,
how about some ramen?


339
00:32:18.314 --> 00:32:19.872
One ramen?

340
00:32:20.082 --> 00:32:22.210
Anyone else want to order?

341
00:32:24.756 --> 00:32:26.280
Welcome.

342
00:32:33.267 --> 00:32:34.825
Looks good!

343
00:32:35.036 --> 00:32:37.369
I've been losing from the start.

344
00:32:37.573 --> 00:32:39.838
- Whose turn is it now?
- South Wind.


345
00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.675
Shut up, Noboru.

346
00:32:47.887 --> 00:32:48.911
No hints.

347
00:32:49.722 --> 00:32:53.215
- Who's winning?
- Yakko. Can't stop her.


348
00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:03.202
- That one!
- Stop it!


349
00:33:06.745 --> 00:33:09.306
Sir, Mr. Kanematsu has arrived.

350
00:33:09.916 --> 00:33:11.042
Sir!

351
00:33:11.484 --> 00:33:13.146
I heard you.

352
00:33:13.354 --> 00:33:16.654
What was the last tile?
- The 2 Circle.


353
00:33:20.964 --> 00:33:23.455
He says he's in a hurry.

354
00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:27.038
I'm going back now.

355
00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.502
Just what I was looking for.

356
00:33:33.314 --> 00:33:35.909
This one?
- This one's better.


357
00:33:36.118 --> 00:33:37.949
You're right.

358
00:33:38.153 --> 00:33:39.781
No coaching!

359
00:33:45.797 --> 00:33:47.264
Hello.

360
00:33:48.234 --> 00:33:49.201
Welcome back.

361
00:33:54.676 --> 00:33:56.143
Hey, missus,

362
00:33:56.344 --> 00:33:58.836
she's the one
you were asking about.


363
00:34:01.718 --> 00:34:02.845
Welcome.

364
00:34:04.155 --> 00:34:05.817
Your turn.

365
00:34:13.133 --> 00:34:15.659
- Ready.
- So soon?


366
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.634
That was fast.

367
00:34:19.108 --> 00:34:23.547
I'll take that.
Three triplets with a Lucky Dragon.


368
00:34:23.748 --> 00:34:26.182
Three triplets beginning with a 5!

369
00:34:26.385 --> 00:34:29.480
- I'll never get home.
- It's okay.


370
00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:32.386
- Let me play.
- I'm losing.


371
00:34:34.295 --> 00:34:36.264
Don't worry.

372
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:43.264
Did you see Kenji?

373
00:34:43.474 --> 00:34:46.376
He hasn't come here yet.

374
00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:52.284
Akiko, come sit by me.

375
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:57.254
Please.

376
00:34:58.193 --> 00:35:00.389
How do you know about me?

377
00:35:01.164 --> 00:35:04.191
Didn't you once live
in Ushigome?


378
00:35:04.902 --> 00:35:08.533
Yes, as a child.
I don't remember it, though.


379
00:35:08.741 --> 00:35:10.709
I was your neighbor.

380
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.037
Really?

381
00:35:16.284 --> 00:35:19.049
Is everyone well?

382
00:35:19.388 --> 00:35:22.517
You have a sister, don't you?
Does she have a child?


383
00:35:22.726 --> 00:35:24.251
Yes, a daughter.

384
00:35:24.462 --> 00:35:26.761
Is that so?
How old is she?


385
00:35:27.199 --> 00:35:28.291
Two.

386
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.529
Must be cute.
What about your brother?


387
00:35:33.174 --> 00:35:36.474
- He died.
- How did that happen?


388
00:35:38.481 --> 00:35:41.110
Climbing in
the Tanigawadake mountains.


389
00:35:41.985 --> 00:35:42.974
When?

390
00:35:44.422 --> 00:35:45.980
Summer of 1951.

391
00:35:46.658 --> 00:35:48.456
I see.

392
00:35:55.803 --> 00:35:57.863
Your ramen's on the way.

393
00:35:58.975 --> 00:36:03.310
Say, will you get
some rice curry for me?


394
00:36:04.983 --> 00:36:08.010
- Hasn't Soma come?
- Not yet.


395
00:36:11.225 --> 00:36:13.625
I'll make some tea.

396
00:36:13.962 --> 00:36:16.955
Won't you please come inside?

397
00:36:27.646 --> 00:36:29.376
Where do you live now?

398
00:36:30.383 --> 00:36:31.543
Zoshigaya.

399
00:36:34.488 --> 00:36:36.150
Are you working?

400
00:36:36.691 --> 00:36:39.252
No, I'm studying
English shorthand.


401
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.360
Do you play mahjong often?

402
00:36:42.766 --> 00:36:44.860
Now and then.

403
00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.202
It's better that way.

404
00:36:49.743 --> 00:36:51.904
We're done.

405
00:36:57.185 --> 00:36:58.152
Who won?

406
00:36:58.353 --> 00:37:00.822
Don't ask.
She isn't nice, is she?


407
00:37:01.024 --> 00:37:05.429
I'm the biggest loser again.
Now I really can't leave.


408
00:37:07.032 --> 00:37:08.728
Kenji's late, isn't he?

409
00:37:56.965 --> 00:37:58.125
I'm home.

410
00:37:58.935 --> 00:38:00.425
Welcome back.

411
00:38:00.637 --> 00:38:02.697
Lock the door.

412
00:38:17.126 --> 00:38:19.618
- I'm home.
- Hello.


413
00:38:20.063 --> 00:38:21.360
You want supper?

414
00:38:21.631 --> 00:38:23.099
I already ate.

415
00:38:34.249 --> 00:38:35.648
You're still up?

416
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:39.150
I waited up for you,
but I'll go to bed now.


417
00:39:45.243 --> 00:39:48.441
- Father's been worrying.
- About what?


418
00:39:48.647 --> 00:39:51.139
Your coming home
so late, of course.


419
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:57.317
Why are you always so late?

420
00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.224
Shorthand is difficult.

421
00:40:00.697 --> 00:40:03.895
Sometimes I go
to a friend's house to practice.


422
00:40:04.102 --> 00:40:05.967
I told Father that.

423
00:40:06.171 --> 00:40:10.166
Try to come home earlier.
He worries about you.


424
00:40:14.715 --> 00:40:16.547
You know...

425
00:40:16.752 --> 00:40:20.211
I met a strange woman today.
She knows all about our family.


426
00:40:20.423 --> 00:40:21.914
Who was that?

427
00:40:22.126 --> 00:40:27.064
She said she was
a neighbor of ours in Ushigome.


428
00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.158
Who is she?

429
00:40:29.368 --> 00:40:31.428
She owns a mahjong parlor
called Kotobuki-So.


430
00:40:31.939 --> 00:40:33.372
You go there often?

431
00:40:33.575 --> 00:40:36.066
No, some friends took me.

432
00:40:36.946 --> 00:40:39.916
That woman knows you well.

433
00:40:40.116 --> 00:40:41.640
Who could it be?

434
00:40:42.285 --> 00:40:44.686
She knew about our brother too.

435
00:40:44.889 --> 00:40:47.620
- What is she like?
- What do you mean?


436
00:40:47.826 --> 00:40:49.158
How old?

437
00:40:49.362 --> 00:40:52.958
She looked fairly young,
but I don't know. She's pretty.


438
00:40:54.803 --> 00:40:58.433
- Does she live alone?
- No, she has a husband.


439
00:40:58.641 --> 00:41:00.473
Is he a tall man?

440
00:41:00.677 --> 00:41:04.876
Not so tall. Sort of funny-Iooking,
with a bit of a limp.


441
00:41:14.295 --> 00:41:19.428
For some reason, I almost felt
as if she were our mother.


442
00:41:20.536 --> 00:41:21.504
Why?

443
00:41:21.705 --> 00:41:25.642
No reason. I just did.

444
00:41:26.378 --> 00:41:30.976
She couldn't be our mother.
She's just a stranger.


445
00:41:31.184 --> 00:41:33.084
I guess so.

446
00:41:34.422 --> 00:41:36.323
I was only three then.

447
00:41:37.126 --> 00:41:38.525
That's right.

448
00:42:11.271 --> 00:42:16.074
CHINCHIN-KEN
CHINESE NOODLES


449
00:42:23.487 --> 00:42:25.080
Welcome.

450
00:42:27.827 --> 00:42:28.885
Are you alone?

451
00:42:29.095 --> 00:42:31.189
Has Kenji been here?

452
00:42:32.399 --> 00:42:35.096
Mr. Kimura?
Not in a couple days.


453
00:42:35.303 --> 00:42:37.670
He hasn't been in?

454
00:42:37.873 --> 00:42:38.863
No, he hasn't.

455
00:42:39.476 --> 00:42:44.312
Hey, when did I last deliver food
to Mr. Kimura?


456
00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:46.818
<i>Night before last.</i>

457
00:42:49.455 --> 00:42:51.048
I'll come again.

458
00:43:04.242 --> 00:43:05.504
Who was that?

459
00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:10.376
That little delinquent
who's always in here with Kimura.


460
00:43:10.583 --> 00:43:12.074
Your charcoal's lit.

461
00:43:13.454 --> 00:43:16.322
Hey, close
the bottom of the stove.


462
00:43:18.127 --> 00:43:20.095
I mean
kindly close it, please.


463
00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:04.588
Hello.

464
00:44:05.557 --> 00:44:08.584
- You're early.
- I've got the early shift.


465
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:30.749
Hello.

466
00:44:30.957 --> 00:44:33.222
Hi. What's up?

467
00:44:33.427 --> 00:44:36.397
Do you know where he is?

468
00:44:36.598 --> 00:44:39.432
You haven't found him yet?

469
00:44:39.636 --> 00:44:42.970
I saw him this morning.
- Oh? I went to his room --


470
00:44:43.174 --> 00:44:46.042
Why are you chasing him?

471
00:44:46.244 --> 00:44:49.544
I'm not chasing him.
We just need to talk.


472
00:44:49.749 --> 00:44:53.278
Don't you two overdo it.
You can go blind, you know.


473
00:44:54.189 --> 00:44:55.087
Huh?

474
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:57.555
Just talking to myself.

475
00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:02.355
Water, please.

476
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:04.795
Water?

477
00:45:25.363 --> 00:45:26.456
So long.

478
00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:27.996
Leaving already?

479
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:29.691
You just got here.

480
00:45:39.315 --> 00:45:41.375
Well, ain't that lucky?

481
00:45:44.122 --> 00:45:46.420
- I have to talk to you.
- About what?


482
00:45:46.625 --> 00:45:47.957
Come with me.

483
00:45:48.561 --> 00:45:50.154
I'm kind of busy.

484
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:52.020
It won't take long.

485
00:45:53.268 --> 00:45:55.498
Kenji, go with her.

486
00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.138
Please.

487
00:46:14.262 --> 00:46:18.063
Where'd you and the madam
go last night?


488
00:46:18.301 --> 00:46:19.359
Nowhere.

489
00:46:19.568 --> 00:46:23.006
I saw you two getting in a car
near Sukiyabashi.


490
00:46:23.207 --> 00:46:24.538
Did you now?

491
00:46:24.742 --> 00:46:27.678
I saw you too --
getting in a car with Mr. Kon.


492
00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.543
Liar! He wouldn't
have the guts.


493
00:47:04.463 --> 00:47:07.956
This is terrible.
How can this be?


494
00:47:09.235 --> 00:47:10.760
What's terrible?

495
00:47:12.373 --> 00:47:15.969
You're absolutely sure?

496
00:47:16.378 --> 00:47:19.781
You think I'm lying to you?

497
00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:23.047
You think I could lie about this?

498
00:47:23.421 --> 00:47:28.121
No, I don't...
but what a mess.


499
00:47:28.495 --> 00:47:32.364
I'm the one in trouble.
Much more than you.


500
00:47:35.303 --> 00:47:39.502
Please be serious.
Stop looking so indifferent.


501
00:47:39.709 --> 00:47:44.808
Indifferent? It's all I've been
thinking about since you told me.


502
00:47:45.216 --> 00:47:48.812
But you've been avoiding me.

503
00:47:49.021 --> 00:47:50.319
That's not true.

504
00:47:50.524 --> 00:47:53.289
You've been running away from me!

505
00:47:57.866 --> 00:48:01.064
What are we going to do?

506
00:48:01.605 --> 00:48:05.440
I wonder if it's even mine.

507
00:48:07.613 --> 00:48:09.911
Who else's could it be?

508
00:48:10.484 --> 00:48:13.386
Whose do you think it is?

509
00:48:13.988 --> 00:48:16.457
Are you that suspicious?

510
00:48:18.327 --> 00:48:19.886
It isn't that.

511
00:48:20.096 --> 00:48:23.965
Then what do you intend to do?

512
00:48:24.168 --> 00:48:26.501
What am I to do?

513
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.461
Stop crying like that.

514
00:48:50.704 --> 00:48:52.434
Let's think it over.

515
00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.116
What a mess.

516
00:49:08.661 --> 00:49:10.596
I have to go now.

517
00:49:11.598 --> 00:49:15.934
I've got to meet
Professor Otsuka at 6:30.


518
00:49:16.138 --> 00:49:18.606
Wait for me at the Etoile,
will you?


519
00:49:26.952 --> 00:49:31.391
I'll be there by 9:30, okay?

520
00:49:32.493 --> 00:49:36.396
I'm going.
Be sure to wait for me.


521
00:50:59.409 --> 00:51:01.844
Then what happened?

522
00:51:02.913 --> 00:51:05.144
Say something.

523
00:51:07.153 --> 00:51:08.620
Welcome.

524
00:51:20.503 --> 00:51:22.233
Thank you.

525
00:51:35.523 --> 00:51:37.355
What did you say then?

526
00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.527
Nothing.

527
00:51:38.761 --> 00:51:39.854
Liar!

528
00:52:32.065 --> 00:52:33.693
Quite late, isn't it?

529
00:52:38.875 --> 00:52:41.366
What are you doing
in a place like this?


530
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:44.507
Thinking about something?

531
00:52:45.784 --> 00:52:47.411
Something worrying you?

532
00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.926
Expecting someone?

533
00:52:56.799 --> 00:52:58.266
It doesn't concern you.

534
00:52:58.701 --> 00:53:00.260
That's true.

535
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:04.168
You've been waiting a long time.
Where do you live?


536
00:53:04.676 --> 00:53:06.304
What's it to you?

537
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.595
- Where's your home?
- None of your business.


538
00:53:25.804 --> 00:53:28.171
You'd better tell me.

539
00:53:29.676 --> 00:53:31.303
Who are you?

540
00:53:47.567 --> 00:53:49.728
I see you around sometimes.

541
00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:51.736
Where do you live?

542
00:54:44.876 --> 00:54:47.071
Answer me.

543
00:54:51.385 --> 00:54:53.650
Do you do this often?

544
00:54:54.956 --> 00:54:56.048
No.

545
00:55:00.497 --> 00:55:04.594
Stealing women's underwear
at your age. Why?


546
00:55:06.739 --> 00:55:08.765
You married?

547
00:55:11.178 --> 00:55:12.236
No.

548
00:55:23.228 --> 00:55:26.198
You cold over there?
Come and warm yourself up.


549
00:55:33.341 --> 00:55:35.071
<i>Hello?</i>

550
00:55:35.277 --> 00:55:36.744
<i>That's right.</i>

551
00:55:37.212 --> 00:55:40.945
<i>No, I haven't heard anything yet.</i>

552
00:55:41.218 --> 00:55:43.881
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

553
00:56:00.977 --> 00:56:04.106
I'm Akiko Sugiyama's sister.

554
00:56:05.084 --> 00:56:06.483
Thank you for coming.

555
00:56:06.685 --> 00:56:08.711
Officer Wada, she's here.

556
00:56:08.922 --> 00:56:10.686
Come around, please.

557
00:56:22.974 --> 00:56:27.378
Sorry we had to call you here.
You're her older sister?


558
00:56:27.713 --> 00:56:30.808
Takako, was it?
Please have a seat.


559
00:56:36.959 --> 00:56:39.986
My father couldn't come.

560
00:56:40.196 --> 00:56:42.427
I see.
It must have come as a shock.


561
00:56:44.769 --> 00:56:47.295
She hasn't committed any crime.

562
00:56:47.507 --> 00:56:51.342
But young people these days
go astray for the slightest reason.


563
00:56:51.545 --> 00:56:54.208
Please keep
a close eye on her.


564
00:56:56.285 --> 00:57:01.314
A girl shouldn't stay out late alone
for any reason.


565
00:57:01.659 --> 00:57:02.921
I'm terribly sorry.

566
00:57:03.127 --> 00:57:06.586
You there.
Come over here.


567
00:57:12.406 --> 00:57:14.466
Stubborn, isn't she?

568
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:29.560
What's the matter, Akiko?

569
00:58:21.465 --> 00:58:22.592
What is it?

570
00:58:25.738 --> 00:58:27.171
What's wrong?

571
00:58:30.377 --> 00:58:31.845
I don't want to go in.

572
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.908
It's all right.
Father doesn't know.


573
00:58:40.357 --> 00:58:43.156
Come along now, all right?

574
00:59:36.064 --> 00:59:38.727
Father, you're still up?

575
00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:41.770
Come here.

576
00:59:42.139 --> 00:59:44.438
You too, Akiko.

577
00:59:46.645 --> 00:59:49.581
Father, it's late.

578
00:59:49.783 --> 00:59:51.080
Never mind that.

579
00:59:55.657 --> 00:59:57.284
Akiko, come in here.

580
01:00:03.969 --> 01:00:05.596
Where have you been?

581
01:00:07.874 --> 01:00:11.072
The phone rang after you left.

582
01:00:12.981 --> 01:00:15.347
I thought it was Numata,
but it was the police.


583
01:00:20.223 --> 01:00:22.385
Why didn't you say anything?

584
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.327
Why did you hide it?

585
01:00:29.702 --> 01:00:32.695
Akiko, what did the police
want with you?


586
01:00:34.075 --> 01:00:35.667
Sit down.

587
01:00:40.384 --> 01:00:43.946
Father, it's late.
Let's discuss it tomorrow.


588
01:00:44.489 --> 01:00:49.827
Akiko, why were you taken
to the police station?


589
01:00:51.131 --> 01:00:53.362
What did you do?

590
01:00:53.568 --> 01:00:58.098
Why don't you say anything?
Why'd they take you in?


591
01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:05.073
No one in this family
should be taken into police custody.


592
01:01:05.517 --> 01:01:09.010
Father, she didn't do anything.

593
01:01:09.223 --> 01:01:10.850
You be quiet.

594
01:01:11.058 --> 01:01:13.050
Akiko, I'm asking you.

595
01:01:13.595 --> 01:01:19.126
She was only waiting
for a friend at a cafĂ©.


596
01:01:20.237 --> 01:01:23.969
But why so late?

597
01:01:24.877 --> 01:01:27.745
Akiko, what were you
doing there?


598
01:01:30.584 --> 01:01:34.316
You won't tell me?
You're no child of mine.


599
01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:38.651
Father, you mustn't.

600
01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:43.926
It's very late.
Let's discuss this tomorrow.


601
01:01:44.669 --> 01:01:48.300
Akiko,
you'd better go to bed.


602
01:01:51.746 --> 01:01:53.509
Let her go, Father.

603
01:01:56.618 --> 01:01:58.246
She's impossible.

604
01:02:06.299 --> 01:02:08.824
How did she ever
turn out this way?


605
01:02:10.537 --> 01:02:12.335
What a disappointment.

606
01:02:14.709 --> 01:02:17.736
Akiko's Ionely.
I'm sure of it.


607
01:02:20.483 --> 01:02:24.546
Father, please be
more gentle with her.


608
01:02:24.923 --> 01:02:29.361
She grew up without
knowing a mother's love.


609
01:02:29.964 --> 01:02:31.795
That's why she's Ionely.

610
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:39.402
I've tried hard to keep her
from feeling that way.


611
01:02:41.211 --> 01:02:45.047
But without a mother...

612
01:02:47.019 --> 01:02:51.287
I've always tried
to dote on her...


613
01:02:52.226 --> 01:02:56.391
so much so that I was afraid
you'd be jealous.


614
01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:00.261
This is the result.

615
01:03:00.871 --> 01:03:03.670
I made a mistake somewhere.

616
01:03:05.276 --> 01:03:09.112
Bringing up a child...

617
01:03:10.751 --> 01:03:12.777
isn't easy.

618
01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:21.628
Father, please go to bed.

619
01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:38.349
Have you had
any word from Numata?


620
01:03:39.423 --> 01:03:41.984
- No.
- I see.


621
01:03:44.997 --> 01:03:46.589
Good night.

622
01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.660
Good night, Father.

623
01:04:21.645 --> 01:04:23.273
You're still awake?

624
01:04:34.062 --> 01:04:36.896
Please go to sleep.

625
01:04:40.203 --> 01:04:41.364
Sister...

626
01:04:44.543 --> 01:04:46.170
I'm not wanted, am I?

627
01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.307
Why do you say that?

628
01:04:51.252 --> 01:04:53.050
With what Mother did...

629
01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:02.597
I should never have been born.

630
01:06:03.715 --> 01:06:05.479
Take this.

631
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:17.065
Hello!
Is my brother in?


632
01:06:20.905 --> 01:06:22.372
Hello, Auntie.

633
01:06:22.574 --> 01:06:26.170
You're here?
Is your father in? Oh, good.


634
01:06:28.882 --> 01:06:32.683
Hello. I thought you'd be leaving,
so I rushed over.


635
01:06:33.187 --> 01:06:35.315
I leave at noon today.
What is it?


636
01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.925
- Auntie, please sit down.
- That's okay.


637
01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:40.927
Michiko's a good little girl,
aren't you?


638
01:06:41.132 --> 01:06:43.032
What's that?

639
01:06:43.802 --> 01:06:45.827
About what we discussed...

640
01:06:46.038 --> 01:06:47.506
What?

641
01:06:50.511 --> 01:06:53.140
Takako, come here.

642
01:06:54.816 --> 01:06:57.115
Brother, come over here.

643
01:07:05.264 --> 01:07:07.392
- What?
- Where's Akiko?


644
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.093
- She left for school.
- Perfect.


645
01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:16.742
Is Numata well?
That's good.


646
01:07:16.946 --> 01:07:19.381
The other day
we talked about --


647
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:24.815
Try this. A new cream
we're going to sell.


648
01:07:25.023 --> 01:07:29.962
Which do you think
would be good for Akiko?


649
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:37.102
The one with a long face

650
01:07:37.307 --> 01:07:43.771
is the second son of that Diet member
who died of a stroke.


651
01:07:45.117 --> 01:07:47.450
He certainly does have
a long face.


652
01:07:49.923 --> 01:07:50.890
It's true.

653
01:07:51.091 --> 01:07:52.821
I prefer that one there,

654
01:07:53.028 --> 01:07:57.693
the son of a wholesaler
we do business with.


655
01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:01.167
Graduated from Rikkyo.
Comes to our office often with his father.


656
01:08:01.372 --> 01:08:04.365
Looks like that actor Kinnosuke.

657
01:08:04.676 --> 01:08:06.007
Take a look.

658
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:12.576
Oh, and the strangest thing
happened.


659
01:08:12.787 --> 01:08:15.279
I ran into her.
- Who?


660
01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:19.929
I was on the escalator
in the department store.


661
01:08:20.364 --> 01:08:23.061
She looked
very familiar from the back.


662
01:08:23.268 --> 01:08:25.260
And it was her!

663
01:08:26.172 --> 01:08:28.835
- Who?
- Kikuko!


664
01:08:30.744 --> 01:08:31.712
Mother?

665
01:08:33.214 --> 01:08:35.183
She moved here two years ago.

666
01:08:35.918 --> 01:08:38.752
- So it really was --
- You knew?


667
01:08:39.222 --> 01:08:40.190
No.

668
01:08:40.925 --> 01:08:44.362
She was with a man.
Seemed to be in a rush,


669
01:08:44.563 --> 01:08:47.761
but I made her sit down
and tell me everything.


670
01:08:47.967 --> 01:08:49.629
She's had it tough.

671
01:08:55.611 --> 01:08:58.046
Takako,
I want you to hear this too.


672
01:08:58.248 --> 01:09:02.515
Yamazaki died
in a prison camp in Amur.


673
01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.627
Kikuko heard about it in Koshigoe --
no, Blagoveschensk.


674
01:09:08.828 --> 01:09:12.162
After that,
she went to Nakhodka.


675
01:09:12.801 --> 01:09:16.363
She runs a mahjong parlor
in Gotanda now.


676
01:09:16.572 --> 01:09:21.773
She was a little reluctant to tell me
that the man was her new husband.


677
01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.540
It seems they met in Nakhodka.

678
01:09:25.417 --> 01:09:27.943
- Auntie.
- What?


679
01:09:28.722 --> 01:09:30.657
What is he like?

680
01:09:30.858 --> 01:09:33.794
His hair's unkempt.
Seemed easy-going.


681
01:09:37.333 --> 01:09:42.294
If I'd taken a different escalator,
I'd never have seen her.


682
01:09:42.506 --> 01:09:44.702
It was quite something.

683
01:09:50.584 --> 01:09:54.545
So what do you think
about these two?


684
01:10:18.087 --> 01:10:21.388
THIS WAY TO KOTOBUKI
-SO

685
01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:25.938
Welcome.

686
01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.021
Mother?

687
01:11:40.464 --> 01:11:41.761
I'm Takako.

688
01:11:43.902 --> 01:11:45.495
Takako!

689
01:11:45.971 --> 01:11:49.100
Please come inside!

690
01:11:51.412 --> 01:11:53.175
Please.

691
01:12:04.096 --> 01:12:07.032
Won't you come inside?

692
01:12:08.802 --> 01:12:09.791
That's all right.

693
01:12:14.342 --> 01:12:17.710
What is it?
Please come in.


694
01:12:30.197 --> 01:12:33.133
It was nice of you to come.

695
01:12:34.102 --> 01:12:38.301
I hear you're a mother now too.
You have a daughter?


696
01:12:39.209 --> 01:12:40.801
She must be cute.

697
01:12:43.782 --> 01:12:46.843
What does your husband do?

698
01:12:47.821 --> 01:12:49.584
Here you go.

699
01:12:52.894 --> 01:12:56.593
I came to ask a favor of you.

700
01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.928
What is it?
Ask any favor you like.


701
01:13:02.406 --> 01:13:07.641
Don't tell Akiko
that you're her mother.


702
01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:16.548
She doesn't remember
anything about you.


703
01:13:17.494 --> 01:13:21.932
The pictures were all burned.
She doesn't even know what you look like.


704
01:13:23.167 --> 01:13:27.833
This is no time
to tell her you're her mother.


705
01:13:28.341 --> 01:13:31.641
Why not?
What's wrong with it?


706
01:13:32.681 --> 01:13:36.277
Don't you think it would
make things hard for Father?


707
01:13:42.327 --> 01:13:46.094
Please do as I ask.
I must go now.


708
01:14:03.955 --> 01:14:05.821
Hello.

709
01:14:10.464 --> 01:14:12.763
Who was that woman
who just left?


710
01:14:13.768 --> 01:14:15.669
Welcome back.

711
01:14:16.372 --> 01:14:19.536
She's pretty.
Who is she?


712
01:14:20.076 --> 01:14:25.846
She came looking for her sister --
the one who was here the other day.


713
01:14:26.051 --> 01:14:27.576
Is that so?

714
01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:29.685
She's a beauty.

715
01:14:36.065 --> 01:14:40.765
Listen, we need
to give Soma an answer soon.


716
01:14:40.971 --> 01:14:43.202
He's been very considerate
and helpful.


717
01:14:43.408 --> 01:14:45.434
I think I'd like to go.

718
01:14:46.145 --> 01:14:50.481
Muroran can't be
as cold as Jiamusi.


719
01:14:50.685 --> 01:14:53.280
Those Manchurian winters
were cold!


720
01:14:58.929 --> 01:15:01.864
Well, how about it?

721
01:15:02.701 --> 01:15:05.500
The work isn't bad either.

722
01:15:05.705 --> 01:15:07.536
Sales department.

723
01:15:08.041 --> 01:15:09.838
Go ahead if you want to.

724
01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:13.670
You don't want to go?

725
01:15:14.416 --> 01:15:16.714
I don't want to go by myself.

726
01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.290
I could never sleep alone
in the freezing cold in Muroran.


727
01:15:21.659 --> 01:15:25.426
Come on.
Let's go together.


728
01:15:39.816 --> 01:15:44.448
KASAHARA OB/GYN CLINIC

729
01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:18.425
Make sure you rest.
We don't want you bleeding again.


730
01:16:20.971 --> 01:16:24.339
- What do I owe you?
- That's 200 yen.


731
01:16:27.413 --> 01:16:28.745
Thank you.

732
01:16:28.949 --> 01:16:30.382
Take care.

733
01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:40.730
<i>Who's next?</i>

734
01:16:53.215 --> 01:16:54.409
Sit down.

735
01:16:55.050 --> 01:16:57.918
What was your name again?

736
01:16:58.756 --> 01:17:00.121
Sugiyama.

737
01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:02.020
Ah, right.

738
01:17:09.269 --> 01:17:12.239
What have you decided to do?

739
01:17:13.242 --> 01:17:16.679
I think I'd better --

740
01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:21.341
I see. I agree with you.
You seem too frail to give birth.


741
01:17:40.878 --> 01:17:45.043
Where's your bar?
Shinjuku? Shibuya?


742
01:17:45.551 --> 01:17:49.649
A lot of girls
like you come in here.


743
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:52.889
Once in a while,
girls from good families sneak in,


744
01:17:53.094 --> 01:17:57.327
but unless they give
a good reason, I turn them down.


745
01:17:59.069 --> 01:18:01.095
- Um...
- Yes?


746
01:18:01.306 --> 01:18:04.105
Do I have to go
into the hospital?


747
01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:07.244
No, the anesthetic wears off
in a few hours,


748
01:18:07.447 --> 01:18:09.813
and then you rest at home.

749
01:18:10.017 --> 01:18:11.678
Let's have the thermometer.

750
01:18:19.096 --> 01:18:20.927
You don't have a fever.

751
01:18:25.872 --> 01:18:28.000
Shall we do it today?

752
01:18:28.342 --> 01:18:30.469
Yes, please.

753
01:18:33.548 --> 01:18:36.712
The standard fee is 3,000.
You have it?


754
01:18:37.554 --> 01:18:38.316
Yes.

755
01:18:38.521 --> 01:18:41.855
Girls often have
no money afterwards


756
01:18:42.059 --> 01:18:45.552
and can't come back
for follow-up care.


757
01:18:45.764 --> 01:18:48.700
You're sure you have enough?

758
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:50.630
That's all right.

759
01:18:50.838 --> 01:18:53.364
You can give it to me later.

760
01:18:53.575 --> 01:18:55.009
Come with me.

761
01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:01.180
This way, please.

762
01:19:36.131 --> 01:19:38.965
Michiko's such a good girl!

763
01:19:48.147 --> 01:19:49.740
Who's that?

764
01:19:57.794 --> 01:20:00.559
Oh, it's you.

765
01:20:03.167 --> 01:20:04.294
I'm back.

766
01:20:04.503 --> 01:20:05.834
Welcome home.

767
01:20:06.506 --> 01:20:09.670
What's wrong?
You look so pale.


768
01:20:10.344 --> 01:20:11.868
I have a headache.

769
01:20:12.814 --> 01:20:15.375
- Did you catch a cold?
- No.


770
01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:20.288
What is it?
You're acting so strange.


771
01:20:22.394 --> 01:20:25.694
Shall I pull out your futon?
Wait here.


772
01:21:22.407 --> 01:21:24.103
Are you all right?

773
01:21:28.582 --> 01:21:30.710
You'd better change.

774
01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:33.245
I'm all right.

775
01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:36.358
It's nothing.

776
01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.424
Don't worry.
- But --


777
01:21:38.795 --> 01:21:41.162
I'll be okay if I rest a bit.

778
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:25.518
- You want to take something?
- No, I'm fine.


779
01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:35.937
You don't have a fever.

780
01:22:37.307 --> 01:22:39.674
Any chills?
- No.


781
01:22:43.949 --> 01:22:47.682
Auntie came today
not long after you left.


782
01:22:48.355 --> 01:22:52.258
Bustling about as usual.
I wondered why she came so early.


783
01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:56.523
She's been finding matches for you.
She brought two pictures.


784
01:22:57.133 --> 01:23:00.331
One has an awfully long face.

785
01:23:00.538 --> 01:23:02.871
Auntie seems to prefer
the other one.


786
01:23:03.075 --> 01:23:04.667
I don't want to get married.

787
01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:09.046
I can't.

788
01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:10.844
Why not?

789
01:23:11.953 --> 01:23:13.215
I don't want to.

790
01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:16.783
I see.

791
01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:19.924
I guess I don't set
a very good example.


792
01:23:26.038 --> 01:23:30.170
But Akiko, there are
many happy couples.


793
01:23:30.878 --> 01:23:33.347
My marriage is an exception.

794
01:23:33.548 --> 01:23:35.847
You're young.
Your life's ahead of you.


795
01:23:36.052 --> 01:23:39.022
Who knows
what happiness lies in store?


796
01:23:39.523 --> 01:23:42.186
Don't let my example
discourage you.


797
01:23:42.827 --> 01:23:47.391
Your life's just beginning.
You'll find happiness --


798
01:23:47.601 --> 01:23:48.795
Takako.

799
01:23:49.002 --> 01:23:49.900
What?

800
01:23:50.638 --> 01:23:52.401
Let me get some sleep.

801
01:23:53.575 --> 01:23:55.372
Are you sleepy?

802
01:23:56.946 --> 01:24:00.348
Go to sleep then.
You're not cold, are you?


803
01:24:01.085 --> 01:24:03.145
Call me if you need anything.

804
01:24:09.163 --> 01:24:11.359
I'll leave the lights off.

805
01:25:35.745 --> 01:25:37.372
Is the president here?

806
01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:41.018
He's meeting with the director
of Tajima Shipyards.


807
01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:44.053
I see.
It'll probably be a long talk.


808
01:25:45.324 --> 01:25:48.590
I'll be at my usual place.
Let me know when they finish.


809
01:26:09.923 --> 01:26:12.893
<i>Mr. Sugiyama sure loves
those pachinko machines.</i>


810
01:26:13.094 --> 01:26:15.256
He always tries
to get the top score.


811
01:26:15.464 --> 01:26:18.730
It's just like him.

812
01:26:18.935 --> 01:26:23.033
It is. He's the only auditor
who reads all the daily reports.


813
01:26:43.502 --> 01:26:47.234
Hey, the balls
aren't dropping in No. 70.


814
01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.237
<i>Just a minute.</i>

815
01:26:59.857 --> 01:27:02.383
Odd place to find you.

816
01:27:02.594 --> 01:27:03.822
Why, hello.

817
01:27:04.029 --> 01:27:06.464
I went to the bank,
but they sent me here.


818
01:27:06.666 --> 01:27:08.134
Is something up?

819
01:27:08.335 --> 01:27:10.827
They're stuck again!

820
01:27:11.039 --> 01:27:13.941
Hasebe's back, you know.

821
01:27:14.143 --> 01:27:15.633
I saw it in the newspaper.

822
01:27:15.844 --> 01:27:18.370
Seems he had
a hard time over there,


823
01:27:18.582 --> 01:27:22.418
so we thought
we'd have a class reunion.


824
01:27:22.621 --> 01:27:23.883
Will you come?

825
01:27:24.089 --> 01:27:26.183
I guess I could.

826
01:27:26.593 --> 01:27:30.360
I have to go to Osaka
for four or five days.


827
01:27:30.564 --> 01:27:32.999
Will you notify the others?

828
01:27:33.201 --> 01:27:34.396
Why me?

829
01:27:34.604 --> 01:27:36.834
Come on, I'm too busy.

830
01:27:37.039 --> 01:27:39.235
I guess I have no choice.

831
01:27:39.443 --> 01:27:41.571
Want to try?
Take some.


832
01:28:00.337 --> 01:28:01.737
This is hard.

833
01:28:02.507 --> 01:28:06.342
It's not like golf.
It's all in the thumb.


834
01:28:07.314 --> 01:28:09.145
I see what you mean.

835
01:28:09.816 --> 01:28:12.047
Where shall we hold
the meeting?


836
01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:16.919
Somewhere not too expensive.
There'll be a lot of people.


837
01:28:17.127 --> 01:28:18.685
That makes sense.

838
01:28:20.965 --> 01:28:23.935
Say, Akiko came to our house
a few days ago


839
01:28:24.136 --> 01:28:26.105
and asked for a loan.

840
01:28:26.539 --> 01:28:28.167
Did she tell you?

841
01:28:30.144 --> 01:28:33.843
My wife gave her the money,
no questions asked.


842
01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:36.018
I wonder why she needed it.

843
01:28:36.987 --> 01:28:40.947
- Oh, that. I'll pay you back.
- There's no hurry.


844
01:28:41.159 --> 01:28:46.292
She needed it suddenly
to help a friend.


845
01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:47.962
5,000, right?

846
01:28:48.168 --> 01:28:50.729
Yes, but don't worry.

847
01:28:51.505 --> 01:28:53.474
You can pay me later.

848
01:28:54.376 --> 01:28:57.175
You see, I'd already
left the house that day.


849
01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:00.282
Please don't blame your wife.

850
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:17.938
KOTOBUKI
-SO

851
01:29:41.672 --> 01:29:43.300
Is my boss here?

852
01:29:43.675 --> 01:29:45.439
Not today.

853
01:29:45.645 --> 01:29:46.942
Where can he be?

854
01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:51.643
Your boss is missing?

855
01:29:52.888 --> 01:29:54.516
He sure loves his mahjong.

856
01:29:54.724 --> 01:29:58.718
He was here till 2:00 a.m.,
on a rare winning streak.


857
01:29:59.563 --> 01:30:03.227
That is rare.
Do things like that really happen?


858
01:30:04.136 --> 01:30:06.104
It's just a pastime for him.

859
01:30:07.073 --> 01:30:10.339
Yeah, he's a real philanthropist,
always giving us his money.


860
01:30:12.013 --> 01:30:13.140
You said it.

861
01:30:13.749 --> 01:30:17.117
He practically bought
this shirt for me.


862
01:30:17.353 --> 01:30:19.151
A very nice man.

863
01:30:20.591 --> 01:30:22.890
No doubt a VIP member
of the Red Cross.


864
01:30:23.094 --> 01:30:25.620
Ah, this is it.

865
01:30:25.832 --> 01:30:27.323
From everybody?

866
01:30:33.509 --> 01:30:34.806
Hello.

867
01:30:38.582 --> 01:30:40.346
Wasn't Kenji with you?

868
01:30:40.551 --> 01:30:42.452
He went to Shinjuku.

869
01:30:43.689 --> 01:30:44.656
When?

870
01:30:45.291 --> 01:30:48.728
Stop chasing him around.
Didn't you just see him?


871
01:30:49.496 --> 01:30:52.295
Akiko, you're looking pale.

872
01:30:52.801 --> 01:30:54.827
Something wrong?

873
01:30:55.037 --> 01:30:57.336
- Hurry up and play.
- Okay.


874
01:30:59.710 --> 01:31:01.235
Welcome.

875
01:31:11.492 --> 01:31:13.927
Your sister's pretty, isn't she?

876
01:31:15.698 --> 01:31:17.256
My sister?

877
01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:21.398
How do you know her?

878
01:31:21.606 --> 01:31:24.974
- She stopped in one day.
- Here?


879
01:31:25.478 --> 01:31:26.946
Looking for you.

880
01:31:27.614 --> 01:31:28.546
When?

881
01:31:28.749 --> 01:31:30.411
Let's see.

882
01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:33.615
Four or five days ago.

883
01:31:42.401 --> 01:31:44.130
You're leaving?

884
01:31:44.336 --> 01:31:45.395
Good-bye.

885
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:50.101
What's she so restless for?

886
01:31:51.513 --> 01:31:53.640
Why's Kenji avoiding her?

887
01:31:53.849 --> 01:31:58.844
The story behind it goes deep.
It's heavy stuff.


888
01:31:59.056 --> 01:32:00.251
What is it?

889
01:32:00.458 --> 01:32:03.690
It's all Tomita's fault.

890
01:32:03.896 --> 01:32:06.457
He's a very bad man.

891
01:32:06.666 --> 01:32:10.694
Quit joking. It's between them.
I had nothing to do with it.


892
01:32:10.905 --> 01:32:14.603
- It appears otherwise.
- Cut it out.


893
01:32:14.811 --> 01:32:18.043
Now he's playing dumb.
Devious, aren't you?


894
01:32:18.248 --> 01:32:19.112
So tell us.

895
01:32:19.316 --> 01:32:24.187
Once upon a time,
a boy and girl, both pure of heart,


896
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:27.258
were attending
the same junior college.


897
01:32:27.594 --> 01:32:31.258
Young, good-looking,
perfect in every way,


898
01:32:31.466 --> 01:32:36.804
they enjoyed
a beautiful friendship.


899
01:32:37.007 --> 01:32:42.174
But there was a villain dwelling
in the boy's apartment building.


900
01:32:43.115 --> 01:32:47.781
He corrupted the boy,
and with great ease --


901
01:32:47.988 --> 01:32:51.652
how shall I put it? --

902
01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:55.228
brought the boy
and girl together.


903
01:32:55.431 --> 01:32:56.660
Is that true?

904
01:32:56.867 --> 01:33:01.271
It is, every single word.

905
01:33:01.472 --> 01:33:02.940
Shocking, isn't it?

906
01:33:03.142 --> 01:33:05.475
Hey, that's enough.

907
01:33:06.679 --> 01:33:09.376
But there's more.

908
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.946
The girl in question

909
01:33:12.487 --> 01:33:16.686
left college and started
studying English shorthand.


910
01:33:16.893 --> 01:33:20.592
Having fallen in
with the wrong people,


911
01:33:20.965 --> 01:33:23.491
she grew
more and more decadent,


912
01:33:23.702 --> 01:33:26.570
until she and the villain
became friends.


913
01:33:27.941 --> 01:33:31.275
It's now the "lucky seventh inning,"
and, as often happens,


914
01:33:31.679 --> 01:33:34.376
the girl is chasing the boy.

915
01:33:34.583 --> 01:33:37.815
Things have gotten
quite interesting.


916
01:33:38.021 --> 01:33:44.691
To borrow an English
turn of phrase,


917
01:33:44.897 --> 01:33:46.558
her tummy's getting big.

918
01:33:46.766 --> 01:33:48.325
Are you sure?

919
01:33:48.535 --> 01:33:49.695
Is that true?

920
01:33:50.271 --> 01:33:52.034
I can't know for sure,

921
01:33:52.273 --> 01:33:58.441
but in any case, it's quite
a fascinating turn of events.


922
01:33:58.782 --> 01:34:03.551
To think that that girl --
I'm shocked!


923
01:34:03.755 --> 01:34:08.056
True, quite true.
It's shocking.


924
01:34:08.696 --> 01:34:11.723
A shock so great
is seldom heard of.


925
01:34:14.670 --> 01:34:17.299
- What was that?
- A West.


926
01:34:17.508 --> 01:34:19.373
Won't help me.

927
01:34:20.512 --> 01:34:22.707
- Pon!
- Pon?


928
01:34:23.449 --> 01:34:26.044
Talk about a shock.

929
01:34:45.578 --> 01:34:47.046
<i>Who's that?</i>

930
01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:52.887
Oh, it's you.

931
01:34:53.589 --> 01:34:56.559
I have to ask you something.
Come upstairs.


932
01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.820
What's gotten into you?

933
01:35:18.088 --> 01:35:19.282
What is it?

934
01:35:22.861 --> 01:35:26.593
Why did you go
to that mahjong parlor in Gotanda?


935
01:35:28.335 --> 01:35:29.701
Why?

936
01:35:30.504 --> 01:35:32.234
Why did you go?

937
01:35:33.008 --> 01:35:35.341
What did you go there for?

938
01:35:36.012 --> 01:35:37.070
Well...

939
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.272
Why didn't you tell me?

940
01:35:40.117 --> 01:35:42.746
If I had told you --

941
01:35:42.954 --> 01:35:44.889
How did you find out
about that place?


942
01:35:45.458 --> 01:35:46.983
Who told you about it?

943
01:35:47.894 --> 01:35:49.384
Auntie said --

944
01:35:49.597 --> 01:35:54.126
How did Auntie know about it?

945
01:36:04.349 --> 01:36:06.841
Tell me the truth.

946
01:36:07.186 --> 01:36:09.417
I want the truth!

947
01:36:10.525 --> 01:36:13.221
- Auntie ran into her.
- Who?


948
01:36:15.264 --> 01:36:16.459
Mother.

949
01:36:17.734 --> 01:36:21.603
So that woman
is our mother after all.


950
01:36:22.307 --> 01:36:26.109
Why didn't you
tell me it was her?


951
01:36:27.614 --> 01:36:30.982
I never thought
she'd return to Tokyo.


952
01:36:31.653 --> 01:36:35.249
Even if she came back to Japan,
it wouldn't be to Tokyo.


953
01:36:35.591 --> 01:36:37.321
Why wouldn't she?

954
01:36:39.063 --> 01:36:41.999
Tell me. Why not?

955
01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:46.137
Please be honest with me.

956
01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:51.676
Why did Mother leave Father?
What happened?


957
01:36:54.883 --> 01:36:58.912
It was while Father
was away in Seoul.


958
01:36:59.457 --> 01:37:02.018
We were living in Ushigome.

959
01:37:02.761 --> 01:37:08.133
One of Father's subordinates,
Yamazaki, stopped by often


960
01:37:08.569 --> 01:37:11.038
and helped us out
in lots of ways.


961
01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:17.178
He was tall, and fun to be around.
You and I both liked him.


962
01:37:19.183 --> 01:37:22.312
I was a child then too

963
01:37:22.521 --> 01:37:25.082
and didn't understand
what was happening.


964
01:37:25.859 --> 01:37:27.588
So Mother and that man --

965
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:33.790
But never speak of this
in front of Father.


966
01:37:35.805 --> 01:37:38.240
I remember quite well.

967
01:37:38.675 --> 01:37:41.804
Soon after Father came back,

968
01:37:42.013 --> 01:37:45.040
he took us to the zoo.

969
01:37:46.219 --> 01:37:51.157
It was a sunny day.
You were so happy.


970
01:37:51.726 --> 01:37:55.391
You toddled
this way and that.


971
01:37:56.065 --> 01:38:00.025
On the way home that evening,
you fell asleep on the train,


972
01:38:00.438 --> 01:38:02.873
and Father carried you
on his back.


973
01:38:04.610 --> 01:38:08.707
When we got home,

974
01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:13.449
Mother had left,
never to return.


975
01:38:15.558 --> 01:38:19.758
Akiko,
never mention this to Father.


976
01:38:20.665 --> 01:38:23.794
Since that day,

977
01:38:24.002 --> 01:38:26.130
he's tried so hard to forget.

978
01:38:26.339 --> 01:38:28.604
- Then maybe --
- What?


979
01:38:29.477 --> 01:38:31.309
Maybe I'm not Father's child.

980
01:38:32.247 --> 01:38:35.706
Why would you say
such a thing?


981
01:38:36.085 --> 01:38:39.955
I must take after my mother.

982
01:38:40.158 --> 01:38:42.821
I'm not like Father at all.

983
01:38:43.028 --> 01:38:45.827
I only have
Mother's foul blood in my veins.


984
01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.126
No! That's ridiculous!

985
01:38:49.337 --> 01:38:50.895
Why do you think that?

986
01:38:51.105 --> 01:38:54.337
It must be!
I'm not his child!


987
01:38:54.543 --> 01:38:55.943
Akiko!

988
01:38:57.748 --> 01:38:59.215
<i>I'm home.</i>

989
01:38:59.783 --> 01:39:00.876
It's Father.

990
01:39:01.453 --> 01:39:04.116
- I'll go ask him!
- Akiko!


991
01:39:04.690 --> 01:39:06.180
You don't understand.

992
01:39:09.396 --> 01:39:10.523
Akiko!

993
01:39:18.543 --> 01:39:19.703
Father.

994
01:39:22.014 --> 01:39:23.174
What is it?

995
01:39:24.216 --> 01:39:26.981
I want you to tell me --

996
01:39:27.488 --> 01:39:28.614
Akiko!

997
01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.255
What?

998
01:39:39.069 --> 01:39:40.697
What's going on?

999
01:40:11.312 --> 01:40:13.804
KOTOBUKI
-SO

1000
01:40:14.850 --> 01:40:20.791
"Anti-Prostitution Laws Enacted."
Well, I'll be...


1001
01:40:29.036 --> 01:40:31.562
- Is she here?
- Oh, hello.


1002
01:40:31.773 --> 01:40:33.469
Kikuko?

1003
01:40:37.914 --> 01:40:39.780
Good evening.
Are you alone?


1004
01:40:39.984 --> 01:40:42.954
There's something I want to ask.

1005
01:40:43.155 --> 01:40:44.520
What's that?

1006
01:40:45.158 --> 01:40:47.092
Come with me.

1007
01:40:56.172 --> 01:40:57.333
Going out?

1008
01:40:57.775 --> 01:40:59.504
Just for a bit.

1009
01:41:10.992 --> 01:41:13.325
What is it?

1010
01:41:14.596 --> 01:41:17.122
I'd like to speak
to you in private.


1011
01:41:17.333 --> 01:41:19.302
Let me see.

1012
01:41:19.503 --> 01:41:23.338
Where could we go?
Come this way.


1013
01:41:47.775 --> 01:41:49.140
Welcome.

1014
01:41:52.114 --> 01:41:53.742
May I use your room?

1015
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:56.920
Certainly,
but it's a bit of a mess.


1016
01:42:08.068 --> 01:42:09.593
Don't bother.

1017
01:42:09.804 --> 01:42:12.273
I have no help, you see.

1018
01:42:19.416 --> 01:42:22.818
There you are.
Let me know if you need anything.


1019
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:37.801
Come in.
It's kind of dirty, but --


1020
01:42:50.024 --> 01:42:52.425
What did you want
to talk about?


1021
01:42:56.132 --> 01:42:59.661
Whose child am I?

1022
01:43:00.805 --> 01:43:02.136
Whose child?

1023
01:43:02.641 --> 01:43:04.609
I know you're my mother.

1024
01:43:06.179 --> 01:43:10.810
Who said that?
Who told you that?


1025
01:43:12.221 --> 01:43:13.313
My sister.

1026
01:43:14.858 --> 01:43:16.382
Takako told you?

1027
01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.489
Mother,
whose child am I anyway?


1028
01:43:21.233 --> 01:43:23.964
Tell me? Whose?

1029
01:43:27.908 --> 01:43:29.536
Forgive me, Akiko.

1030
01:43:30.511 --> 01:43:34.778
I didn't forget
about you and Takako.


1031
01:43:34.984 --> 01:43:38.922
I thought about you constantly,
wherever I was.


1032
01:43:39.323 --> 01:43:44.091
Your brother too.
I didn't know he had died.


1033
01:43:44.497 --> 01:43:47.831
I kept worrying about you.

1034
01:43:49.169 --> 01:43:52.628
Even if I admitted
that I did wrong,


1035
01:43:52.841 --> 01:43:55.868
none of you
would ever forgive me.


1036
01:43:56.079 --> 01:43:58.070
Never mind that.

1037
01:43:58.282 --> 01:44:00.615
That's not why I came.

1038
01:44:01.352 --> 01:44:04.550
Whose child am I?

1039
01:44:05.258 --> 01:44:08.695
Why, your father's and mine.

1040
01:44:08.896 --> 01:44:10.329
That's a lie!

1041
01:44:10.999 --> 01:44:13.263
Is he really my father?

1042
01:44:14.637 --> 01:44:17.300
Who else would it be?

1043
01:44:17.708 --> 01:44:22.874
Are you that mistrustful?
Don't you believe me?


1044
01:44:27.287 --> 01:44:29.017
He's your father.

1045
01:44:29.691 --> 01:44:33.992
That's one thing
I can tell anyone with pride.


1046
01:44:34.898 --> 01:44:38.494
Akiko, if you only believe
one thing I tell you,


1047
01:44:38.703 --> 01:44:41.935
at least believe that.

1048
01:44:50.418 --> 01:44:54.412
You understand, don't you?

1049
01:44:55.157 --> 01:44:57.217
You understand, right?

1050
01:44:59.263 --> 01:45:00.753
Thank you.

1051
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:14.815
Akiko, one of the customers
was talking about you.


1052
01:45:15.852 --> 01:45:18.378
How is your health?

1053
01:45:21.593 --> 01:45:23.687
He said you were pregnant.

1054
01:45:29.103 --> 01:45:32.164
Are you? Is that true?

1055
01:45:34.009 --> 01:45:36.103
I will never have a baby!

1056
01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:38.380
Never!

1057
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:40.775
Why not?

1058
01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:45.651
And if I do, I won't abandon it
like you did!


1059
01:45:45.858 --> 01:45:48.760
I'll love it with all my heart!

1060
01:45:50.398 --> 01:45:51.194
Akiko!

1061
01:45:53.602 --> 01:45:55.229
I hate you!

1062
01:46:58.021 --> 01:47:01.288
<i>That sixth hole is a jinx.</i>

1063
01:47:01.493 --> 01:47:02.858
It's a dogleg.

1064
01:47:03.061 --> 01:47:06.327
- How many strokes did I take?
- Eight.


1065
01:47:06.666 --> 01:47:08.999
- What was par?
- Four.


1066
01:47:09.203 --> 01:47:11.104
Not even close.

1067
01:47:12.774 --> 01:47:15.801
Where'd she go anyway?

1068
01:47:16.012 --> 01:47:17.139
I have no idea.

1069
01:47:17.347 --> 01:47:21.182
Don't hide it.
Come on, tell me.


1070
01:47:22.154 --> 01:47:23.519
I really don't know.

1071
01:47:23.722 --> 01:47:26.191
You're lying.
I can see it in your eyes.


1072
01:47:30.198 --> 01:47:31.632
Don't run off.

1073
01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:45.216
How long do you plan to mope?

1074
01:47:45.418 --> 01:47:47.353
Forget about him.

1075
01:47:49.290 --> 01:47:53.250
Find a better guy.
There's lots of 'em around.


1076
01:48:00.671 --> 01:48:03.972
What's so special
about him anyway?


1077
01:48:04.777 --> 01:48:07.542
It's all right. I'm leaving.

1078
01:48:20.131 --> 01:48:25.127
Say, who was that?
Nice-Iooking girl.


1079
01:48:25.972 --> 01:48:28.840
Her? She's a wild one.

1080
01:48:29.043 --> 01:48:31.945
What's wrong with that?

1081
01:48:32.147 --> 01:48:35.083
Bad girls are more fun
than the good ones.


1082
01:48:35.585 --> 01:48:36.848
Is that right?

1083
01:48:37.054 --> 01:48:38.578
You oughta know.

1084
01:48:40.358 --> 01:48:41.655
Fill her up.

1085
01:49:02.287 --> 01:49:06.749
CHINCHIN-KEN
CHINESE NOODLES


1086
01:49:13.402 --> 01:49:14.699
Welcome.

1087
01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:23.008
Give me some sake.

1088
01:49:24.818 --> 01:49:28.482
It's getting colder.
Might snow.


1089
01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:54.618
I hear Mr. Kimura's
going to move.


1090
01:49:55.959 --> 01:50:00.227
He was here last night.
Said he was looking around Kamata.


1091
01:50:00.766 --> 01:50:04.294
Did he find an apartment?

1092
01:50:25.498 --> 01:50:26.965
Here you are.

1093
01:50:32.908 --> 01:50:37.779
They say apartments
are scarce these days.


1094
01:50:38.449 --> 01:50:42.717
And the newer ones are
real expensive. You gotta hustle.


1095
01:50:54.737 --> 01:50:56.705
Bring me another.

1096
01:50:58.609 --> 01:51:01.602
Are you sure?
That was a lot.


1097
01:51:04.317 --> 01:51:05.409
I'm fine.

1098
01:51:05.618 --> 01:51:07.678
If you insist.

1099
01:51:48.142 --> 01:51:51.374
So this is where you've been.

1100
01:52:01.359 --> 01:52:05.421
I looked all over.
Couldn't find you anywhere.


1101
01:52:11.874 --> 01:52:14.104
I knew you had
no one to talk to.


1102
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:17.975
I couldn't sleep at night,
thinking how worried you must be.


1103
01:52:18.182 --> 01:52:20.879
It's true.
Look how I'm wasting away.


1104
01:52:25.458 --> 01:52:27.552
What was that for?
Stop it!


1105
01:52:40.445 --> 01:52:42.380
That sure startled me.

1106
01:52:42.615 --> 01:52:45.949
What was that about?
Made me spill the sake.


1107
01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:05.008
Girls these days
sure are hot-tempered.


1108
01:53:05.312 --> 01:53:08.612
They'll walk all over you
if you're not tough.


1109
01:53:27.708 --> 01:53:29.802
Did something happen?

1110
01:53:30.912 --> 01:53:32.574
I'm gonna go see.

1111
01:53:38.322 --> 01:53:40.415
Hey! What happened?

1112
01:54:33.095 --> 01:54:34.722
Still feverish?

1113
01:54:34.931 --> 01:54:36.558
No change yet.

1114
01:54:42.374 --> 01:54:44.309
It's a lot of trouble for you.

1115
01:54:44.844 --> 01:54:47.973
I have no choice.
She's a customer.


1116
01:55:12.414 --> 01:55:15.509
That Kenji is heartless.
Didn't even come to see how you were.


1117
01:55:35.712 --> 01:55:38.113
What happened, Akiko?

1118
01:55:42.554 --> 01:55:43.852
Thank you for everything.

1119
01:55:44.057 --> 01:55:47.186
It was a close call.

1120
01:55:47.394 --> 01:55:53.892
I heard the train whistle
and rushed out to find her like this.


1121
01:55:54.103 --> 01:55:56.402
She had just left my place.

1122
01:55:56.607 --> 01:56:00.510
That's always been a dangerous
crossing. Lots of accidents.


1123
01:56:00.912 --> 01:56:04.714
One newspaper called it
"the devil's crossing."


1124
01:56:05.151 --> 01:56:09.646
Nothing had happened recently,
but now this.


1125
01:56:09.857 --> 01:56:11.758
What a mess.

1126
01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:15.897
The watchman
was taking a leak.


1127
01:56:16.099 --> 01:56:20.936
He saw the train coming and rushed
to lower the gate, pee still dribbling.


1128
01:56:21.139 --> 01:56:23.802
But it was too late.

1129
01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:26.844
She'd already been hit.

1130
01:56:27.047 --> 01:56:30.017
Poor guy's taking it hard.
The police took him away.


1131
01:56:30.218 --> 01:56:32.483
A policeman was here
until a while ago.


1132
01:56:32.688 --> 01:56:35.920
He wants you to wait

1133
01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:41.165
until he gets back
from the station.


1134
01:56:42.167 --> 01:56:46.002
What a terrible thing.

1135
01:56:46.407 --> 01:56:48.602
Thank you for your kindness.

1136
01:56:49.344 --> 01:56:51.904
Not at all.
Well, I'll be going.


1137
01:56:52.113 --> 01:56:55.015
Sorry to keep you so late.

1138
01:56:55.218 --> 01:56:57.015
Don't mention it.

1139
01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:59.621
Father, his name.

1140
01:57:01.427 --> 01:57:05.057
Yoshihira Shimomura.
I run a noodle house nearby.


1141
01:57:05.265 --> 01:57:08.667
They call me Gihei.
Real name's Yoshihira.


1142
01:57:08.869 --> 01:57:12.033
We'll stop in to thank you later.

1143
01:57:12.374 --> 01:57:15.208
Never mind about that.

1144
01:57:15.411 --> 01:57:18.245
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1145
01:57:18.449 --> 01:57:20.042
Thank you.

1146
01:57:38.943 --> 01:57:42.675
I'll be leaving now.
Good night.


1147
01:57:50.625 --> 01:57:53.060
Say, I forgot to tell them
the name of my place.


1148
01:57:53.262 --> 01:57:58.361
Please tell them
it's called Chinchin-Ken.


1149
01:58:29.077 --> 01:58:31.046
Akiko!

1150
01:58:35.218 --> 01:58:37.414
What happened?

1151
01:58:38.022 --> 01:58:40.048
Akiko, what happened?

1152
01:58:43.362 --> 01:58:45.193
I don't want to die.

1153
01:58:46.733 --> 01:58:49.897
I don't want to die.

1154
01:58:50.105 --> 01:58:53.132
You're not going to die.
Don't worry.


1155
01:58:53.342 --> 01:58:55.607
Akiko, you must hold on!

1156
01:59:00.051 --> 01:59:01.952
Takako...

1157
01:59:04.090 --> 01:59:05.887
I don't want to die.

1158
01:59:06.392 --> 01:59:10.057
You'll be fine.
You're not going to die.


1159
01:59:15.104 --> 01:59:16.299
Father.

1160
01:59:16.507 --> 01:59:20.069
What is it?

1161
01:59:21.547 --> 01:59:26.611
I want to start over.

1162
01:59:27.989 --> 01:59:32.427
I want to start my life
over again


1163
01:59:32.628 --> 01:59:34.392
from the beginning.

1164
01:59:36.099 --> 01:59:38.660
Akiko!

1165
01:59:40.071 --> 01:59:41.800
I don't want to die.

1166
01:59:42.942 --> 01:59:46.743
Don't talk like that.
You're going to be fine.


1167
02:01:14.764 --> 02:01:15.891
Mother.

1168
02:01:17.534 --> 02:01:20.869
Hello.

1169
02:01:21.674 --> 02:01:23.198
Akiko is dead.

1170
02:01:24.144 --> 02:01:27.842
When? How?

1171
02:01:31.353 --> 02:01:33.322
How could this happen?

1172
02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.294
It's your fault.

1173
02:01:40.398 --> 02:01:42.026
Takako!

1174
02:01:47.207 --> 02:01:50.439
<i>Takako...
Takako... and Pon!</i>


1175
02:02:44.250 --> 02:02:45.843
<i>Welcome.</i>

1176
02:02:56.333 --> 02:02:57.630
A bottle of sake.

1177
02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:20.124
Did they come to see
about the fire hydrant?


1178
02:03:20.532 --> 02:03:24.435
They want to put it
where the side street dips a bit.


1179
02:03:24.637 --> 02:03:29.804
Mr. Wakana got angry
and refused to put up the money.


1180
02:03:31.746 --> 02:03:35.184
Here you are.
It's a little lukewarm.


1181
02:04:09.631 --> 02:04:12.430
Why'd you leave like that?

1182
02:04:25.018 --> 02:04:26.418
What's wrong?

1183
02:04:29.391 --> 02:04:33.294
What happened
to Soma's job offer?


1184
02:04:33.663 --> 02:04:35.996
It still stands.

1185
02:04:38.736 --> 02:04:42.673
I don't like Tokyo anymore.

1186
02:04:43.877 --> 02:04:44.844
Why's that?

1187
02:04:55.391 --> 02:04:59.693
It would suit me just fine
if you went with me.


1188
02:05:00.999 --> 02:05:02.490
Will you go?

1189
02:05:04.738 --> 02:05:07.036
You will? That's great.

1190
02:05:10.078 --> 02:05:13.173
I'll go tell Soma right away.

1191
02:05:16.186 --> 02:05:22.218
I'm tired of fetching ramen
and rice curry for mahjong players.


1192
02:05:23.763 --> 02:05:26.358
Let's drink to it.

1193
02:05:27.635 --> 02:05:30.036
The cold won't be unbearable.

1194
02:05:32.241 --> 02:05:36.906
If we go together,
it'll be warm enough.


1195
02:05:43.122 --> 02:05:45.614
So you're willing to go.

1196
02:05:46.927 --> 02:05:48.485
I sure am thankful.

1197
02:06:45.438 --> 02:06:46.963
Hello?

1198
02:06:55.753 --> 02:06:57.243
Hello?

1199
02:07:12.908 --> 02:07:15.139
As I mentioned
on the phone...


1200
02:07:18.749 --> 02:07:23.211
I'm leaving for Hokkaido tonight
on the 9:30 train.


1201
02:07:23.723 --> 02:07:28.059
I wanted to bring this
as an offering to Akiko.


1202
02:07:33.102 --> 02:07:34.536
Is that all right?

1203
02:07:40.612 --> 02:07:42.603
Here.

1204
02:07:53.095 --> 02:07:55.860
We may never meet again.

1205
02:07:56.066 --> 02:07:58.535
Take care of yourself.

1206
02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:05.736
I'll be going now.

1207
02:08:06.012 --> 02:08:08.208
Good-bye.

1208
02:09:10.165 --> 02:09:16.299
<i>The express train for Aomori
scheduled to depart at 21:30</i>


1209
02:09:16.507 --> 02:09:18.703
<i>will leave from Track 12,</i>

1210
02:09:19.244 --> 02:09:24.548
<i>with stops at Omiya,
Toyama, Utsunomiya...</i>


1211
02:09:55.726 --> 02:10:01.030
Good thing we came early and got
good seats close to the bathrooms.


1212
02:10:42.688 --> 02:10:46.420
She won't come.
No use looking.


1213
02:11:23.209 --> 02:11:26.977
She's not coming.
Have a drink.


1214
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:31.342
Careful! You'll spill it!

1215
02:11:33.690 --> 02:11:35.659
Just forget it.

1216
02:11:36.427 --> 02:11:38.258
It's getting cold.

1217
02:11:38.930 --> 02:11:41.364
Why would she come?
Here.


1218
02:11:58.322 --> 02:12:00.791
Have another one?

1219
02:12:01.059 --> 02:12:02.493
No, thanks.

1220
02:12:03.196 --> 02:12:07.099
We'll be on this train
until noon tomorrow.


1221
02:12:07.301 --> 02:12:09.600
Our butts are gonna be sore.

1222
02:12:12.308 --> 02:12:15.073
I should have
brought a blanket.


1223
02:12:15.312 --> 02:12:16.836
Yes, you should have.

1224
02:13:47.635 --> 02:13:49.626
You're not seeing her off?

1225
02:13:53.610 --> 02:13:55.703
You can still make it.

1226
02:14:01.988 --> 02:14:05.049
Don't hesitate on my account.

1227
02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:18.038
Father...

1228
02:14:19.677 --> 02:14:21.543
I'm thinking of going back.

1229
02:14:23.249 --> 02:14:24.307
Where?

1230
02:14:27.688 --> 02:14:31.854
I don't want Michiko
to feel the way Akiko did.


1231
02:14:32.662 --> 02:14:37.259
I see now that a child needs
the love of both parents.


1232
02:14:38.303 --> 02:14:41.398
No matter how much love
you gave Akiko,


1233
02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.939
she was still Ionely.

1234
02:14:48.683 --> 02:14:50.652
She wanted a mother.

1235
02:14:53.022 --> 02:14:54.922
Maybe you're right.

1236
02:14:55.893 --> 02:15:01.389
I did my best,
but a mother's love is different.


1237
02:15:02.702 --> 02:15:07.333
She might have told a mother
things she couldn't tell me.


1238
02:15:12.948 --> 02:15:16.579
Can you make a go of it
with Numata?


1239
02:15:20.159 --> 02:15:22.093
I'd like to try.

1240
02:15:23.496 --> 02:15:27.900
Even if it's difficult,
I know I have to.


1241
02:15:31.106 --> 02:15:33.974
Michiko is growing up.

1242
02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:44.888
I see.
So you're going back?


1243
02:15:46.994 --> 02:15:52.457
I'll try very hard this time
not to make you worry.


1244
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:54.159
I see.

1245
02:15:57.608 --> 02:16:00.942
My selfishness
was partly to blame.


1246
02:16:01.146 --> 02:16:03.308
We're all a bit selfish.

1247
02:16:03.516 --> 02:16:07.852
Anyway, give it a try.
I know you'll succeed.


1248
02:16:09.824 --> 02:16:11.622
I'm going to try.

1249
02:16:13.930 --> 02:16:17.765
But Father, if I go,

1250
02:16:18.035 --> 02:16:19.765
what about you?

1251
02:16:19.972 --> 02:16:22.498
Don't worry about me.

1252
02:16:23.877 --> 02:16:25.869
Akiko isn't here now.

1253
02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:28.311
I'll manage somehow.

1254
02:16:28.517 --> 02:16:31.885
I can have Tomizawa
come in again.


1255
02:16:40.266 --> 02:16:42.234
Well, that's that.

1256
02:18:37.822 --> 02:18:39.791
What time will you
be home tonight?


1257
02:18:40.259 --> 02:18:42.592
As early as I can.

1258
02:18:43.029 --> 02:18:44.963
What about supper?

1259
02:18:45.331 --> 02:18:50.635
Boil some rice for me,
though I might not eat it.


1260
02:18:52.041 --> 02:18:55.705
Leave at your usual time.
I have a key.


1261
02:19:08.162 --> 02:19:10.256
Which shoes
will you wear today?


1262
02:19:10.799 --> 02:19:12.495
The black ones, please.
