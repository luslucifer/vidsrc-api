1
00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:16.022
Sensor buried. Stand by
for incoming readings.


2
00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:21.922
It's beautiful Lisa.

3
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:24.427
Is beautiful even
in your vocabulary?


4
00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:28.831
Seism-sensor readings
are coming in now.


5
00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:32.634
We're definitely
getting some activity,


6
00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:35.336
but Joseph, how is it possible...
Ka'ula hasn't shown


7
00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:38.273
volcanic activity in
five million years.


8
00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:41.080
How is this possible so
far from the hotspot?


9
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.849
Joseph?

10
00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.585
Joseph?

11
00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.093
Lisa, I think a submerged
volcanic shelf has surfaced.


12
00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:55.326
There are new islands out here.

13
00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:01.388
When does Landon arrive?

14
00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:02.897
He's flying in soon.

15
00:02:02.898 --> 00:02:04.735
We'll need his help
running some tests.


16
00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:15.844
Lisa I got tremors here!

17
00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:18.846
Joseph it's right on top of you!

18
00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:21.459
Go! Now!

19
00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.659
Lisa!

20
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.895
Joseph?

21
00:03:09.631 --> 00:03:12.600
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Captain has
turned on the fasten seat belt sign


22
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:15.169
as we make our descent to Ka'ula.
Please put your tray


23
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.428
tables and seats in their
upright and full position.


24
00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:41.729
Excuse me. Oh!

25
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.516
Um, I'm so sorry sir. We're
preparing to land. Do you mind


26
00:03:44.517 --> 00:03:47.235
bringing your seat forward and
putting your tray table up.


27
00:03:47.236 --> 00:03:49.203
Thank you. I'll take this.

28
00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:51.707
How could you sleep
through this noise?


29
00:03:52.507 --> 00:03:53.919
Practice.

30
00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.920
Don't you know it isn't
polite to stare?


31
00:04:06.921 --> 00:04:09.657
Tony! Sit down.

32
00:04:09.658 --> 00:04:12.092
Please. I'm sorry about that.

33
00:04:12.093 --> 00:04:14.831
It's alright. No harm.

34
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:17.299
Hank right?

35
00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.367
You look like a Hank.

36
00:04:20.368 --> 00:04:22.302
Actually is uh...

37
00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:23.403
it's Jim.

38
00:04:23.538 --> 00:04:25.807
Jim Kirkland.

39
00:04:25.808 --> 00:04:27.040
Jennifer.

40
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.410
And you've already met Tony.

41
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:31.955
Yeah.

42
00:04:41.755 --> 00:04:43.758
How long have you been married?

43
00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.693
Oh. We're not yet.

44
00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:48.696
I just like to wear it.

45
00:04:48.697 --> 00:04:50.864
Feel like we are anyway.

46
00:04:50.865 --> 00:04:54.836
I took time my auto body shop to meet
her for a little pre-wedding vacation.


47
00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:57.804
That's nice. You've know
each other a long time then?


48
00:04:57.805 --> 00:04:59.340
Six months.

49
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.675
I know it's a little crazy...

50
00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:05.112
There's nothing crazy about it.
If you don't know it within the


51
00:05:05.113 --> 00:05:08.834
first month that she's the
one then you'll never know.


52
00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:28.602
Control, this is 7389.

53
00:05:28.603 --> 00:05:31.271
We may be experiencing some
technical difficulties,


54
00:05:31.272 --> 00:05:34.408
as our radar shows we're closing in on
what seems to be a heavy storm cloud...


55
00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:39.015
but our reports show very little
turbulence. Can you confirm?


56
00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:43.721
Control, can you confirm?

57
00:05:46.521 --> 00:05:48.092
Radio is malfunctioning.

58
00:05:51.892 --> 00:05:56.132
Control this is 7389 do you copy?

59
00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:58.032
Guess we missed it.

60
00:05:58.767 --> 00:05:59.800
Sir.

61
00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:02.203
Oh. Great um...

62
00:06:02.204 --> 00:06:06.139
My Wi-Fi is acting a little janky. Would you
mind checking it out? See if they can fix it?


63
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.044
No I'm sorry. You actually have to turn
it off and put your tray up for landing.


64
00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:11.880
Oh. Sorry.

65
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.780
It's OK.

66
00:06:14.548 --> 00:06:16.050
Can I take that for you?

67
00:06:16.051 --> 00:06:17.018
Sure thanks.

68
00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:18.119
No problem.

69
00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:28.099
Here.

70
00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:34.001
Please, do you have any aspirin?

71
00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:35.837
No. I'm sorry sir we're out.

72
00:06:36.637 --> 00:06:40.107
Oh god... my head. 
I hate flying!

73
00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.910
My apologies. It's the altitude.

74
00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:45.188
We will be descending soon.

75
00:06:52.988 --> 00:06:54.193
Control?

76
00:06:57.993 --> 00:06:59.093
Captain.

77
00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.496
Radio's down.

78
00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:02.597
Down?

79
00:07:02.925 --> 00:07:03.965
That's not what scares me.

80
00:07:03.966 --> 00:07:06.367
What's that?

81
00:07:06.368 --> 00:07:09.305
How long it's been down.

82
00:07:17.077 --> 00:07:21.448
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
experiencing some light... turbulence.


83
00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:24.118
It's OK. It's just an air pocket.

84
00:07:29.224 --> 00:07:31.601
That wasn't an air pocket.

85
00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:41.401
That's not the runway.
Where are we?


86
00:07:41.402 --> 00:07:46.008
Our compass is wrong. There must be
some magnetic interference out there.


87
00:07:46.808 --> 00:07:50.009
Loss of altitude control. The
auto-pilot isn't compensating.


88
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.110
Hold on Spair.

89
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.887
Damn auto-pilot thinks we're
descending on course.


90
00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:00.987
Hey, could you lean back?

91
00:08:00.988 --> 00:08:02.763
What the hell is that?

92
00:08:08.563 --> 00:08:09.663
It's ash.

93
00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.066
Auto
-Pilot disabled

94
00:08:13.067 --> 00:08:14.634
Now when I tell you...

95
00:08:14.635 --> 00:08:17.140
I need you to lay
down the throttle.


96
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.139
On when I tell you!

97
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.240
I hear ya Captain.

98
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.421
Spair, maximum velocity!

99
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.258
- Come on.
- I'm pushing her.


100
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.393
Come on!

101
00:08:40.662 --> 00:08:41.902
Holly sh...

102
00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:49.736
I can't breathe!

103
00:08:49.737 --> 00:08:51.383
Everyone hang on!

104
00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:08.056
Listen...

105
00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:09.824
Look out!

106
00:09:09.825 --> 00:09:10.925
I see it!

107
00:09:17.566 --> 00:09:18.966
I need you to be on the radio.

108
00:09:47.663 --> 00:09:49.596
Auto
-Pilot Engaged

109
00:09:49.597 --> 00:09:50.934
Is everything OK?

110
00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:54.070
Dan!

111
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.340
The code! The code!

112
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.009
For the auto-pilot?

113
00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:04.945
Zero...

114
00:10:04.946 --> 00:10:06.279
Dan!

115
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.751
Zero, Nine...

116
00:10:09.551 --> 00:10:11.118
Dan. Dan!

117
00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:13.254
Dan what is the passcode?

118
00:10:13.255 --> 00:10:14.988
Dan what is the passcode?!

119
00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.897
Dan!

120
00:10:23.697 --> 00:10:24.531
Dan come on...

121
00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:25.899
Hey is everything alright?

122
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.966
He-he's not breathing.

123
00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:29.037
Can you help me out...

124
00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:31.141
Oh he's gone.

125
00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:35.175
OK it's on auto-pilot.

126
00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.012
- Um Rita?
- Yes.


127
00:10:37.013 --> 00:10:40.127
Rita, get on the radio right there and
get a hold of anybody. Anybody at all.


128
00:10:40.128 --> 00:10:42.268
My name is Rick Pierce.
Do it! Just do it!


129
00:10:43.317 --> 00:10:44.417
Hello?

130
00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.220
Can anybody here me?

131
00:10:46.221 --> 00:10:47.355
Hello?

132
00:10:47.356 --> 00:10:49.523
Please help. It's out.

133
00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:51.124
OK yeah. We've been hit.

134
00:10:51.125 --> 00:10:55.136
- You can fly?
- Wait one second. I'll be right back.


135
00:11:03.137 --> 00:11:04.929
- You, what's your name?
- Me? Frank.


136
00:11:04.955 --> 00:11:07.020
Frank come here.
I need your help please.


137
00:11:07.421 --> 00:11:10.145
United States Air
Marshall Kirkland.


138
00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:14.827
- You mind telling me what's going on?
- Yeah, someone's hurt upfront.


139
00:11:27.227 --> 00:11:29.296
Are they dead?

140
00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:32.120
Unconscious. That's all anybody
needs to know right now.


141
00:11:32.134 --> 00:11:34.094
We need the pilot out of his seat.

142
00:11:48.683 --> 00:11:49.382
You OK?

143
00:11:49.383 --> 00:11:51.085
Don't touch me.

144
00:11:51.885 --> 00:11:55.090
I'm sorry. I just
thought you were hurt.


145
00:11:55.723 --> 00:11:58.328
- You sure you're gonna be...
- No.


146
00:12:00.128 --> 00:12:02.185
Well not yet.

147
00:12:23.985 --> 00:12:26.088
He's not really unconscious is he?

148
00:12:26.888 --> 00:12:28.324
He's dead.

149
00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:30.563
Don't let the passengers
see these guys like that.


150
00:12:30.564 --> 00:12:31.825
Gotta get the co-pilot out too.

151
00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:34.646
OK. You got it. 
I'll keep it quiet.

152
00:12:51.446 --> 00:12:53.180
What's going on?

153
00:12:53.181 --> 00:12:54.281
It's alright.

154
00:12:55.656 --> 00:12:57.890
OK, everybody. I'm Air
Marshall Jim Kirkland.


155
00:12:57.891 --> 00:13:00.687
The pilot is knocked
unconscious but,


156
00:13:00.688 --> 00:13:04.224
everything's OK... If there's
anybody able to give us a hand


157
00:13:04.225 --> 00:13:07.494
with medical training please
help each other out...


158
00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.330
That's a volcano!

159
00:13:13.902 --> 00:13:17.581
Hey... I need to know
what you know. I can help.


160
00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:29.555
Show 'em.

161
00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:47.488
Oh my god.

162
00:14:07.288 --> 00:14:09.124
You ever fly anything this big?

163
00:14:09.924 --> 00:14:14.030
No, the largest I've
ever flow is a king air.


164
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.430
9 seater.

165
00:14:16.431 --> 00:14:17.704
Great.

166
00:14:22.504 --> 00:14:25.437
It's stuck on auto-pilot
in a constant loop.


167
00:14:25.438 --> 00:14:29.777
Yeah to prevent terrorist takeovers they
installed an encoded auto-pilot system.


168
00:14:29.778 --> 00:14:32.212
And of course he
knew all the codes.


169
00:14:32.213 --> 00:14:35.216
No Mr. Spair knew them too.

170
00:14:36.016 --> 00:14:37.585
Great.

171
00:14:38.385 --> 00:14:40.756
I study volcanoes and uh...
I doubt this is the worst.


172
00:14:41.556 --> 00:14:43.236
In fact I think she's
just waking up.


173
00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:48.327
Keep your distance and don't fly
us too close or you'll cook us.


174
00:14:48.328 --> 00:14:52.301
No chance of that cause of
the auto-pilot loop, right?


175
00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:55.370
Hope so...

176
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.874
Can you move that thing?

177
00:15:00.674 --> 00:15:04.354
There's a little bit of movement in the wheel.
I might be able to force it to maneuver.


178
00:15:08.817 --> 00:15:10.857
No chance of flying over
that thick ash cloud.


179
00:15:11.586 --> 00:15:12.986
That will destroy our engines.

180
00:15:15.689 --> 00:15:17.324
We're gonna have to ride it out.

181
00:15:17.325 --> 00:15:18.425
Yeah.

182
00:15:21.095 --> 00:15:23.200
And pray we don't get
any aftershocks.


183
00:15:32.072 --> 00:15:33.840
Hey Tully! Wait up.

184
00:15:33.841 --> 00:15:35.408
Thatch, what happened to you?

185
00:15:35.409 --> 00:15:36.976
Breakfast in the
mess hall happened.


186
00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:39.111
Yeah and what do I say?
I said don't eat the gravy.


187
00:15:39.112 --> 00:15:42.081
It's biscuits and gravy. You can't
have one without the other.


188
00:15:42.082 --> 00:15:44.082
Just don't let the old
man see you like this.


189
00:15:44.552 --> 00:15:47.089
Look alive Tully! They're
calling all hands.


190
00:15:47.889 --> 00:15:50.456
I overheard colonel Rhyker
mention a vulcanologist.


191
00:15:50.457 --> 00:15:53.211
That doesn't make sense. What does
Rhyker want with a vulcanologist?


192
00:15:53.212 --> 00:15:54.027
Guess will find out.

193
00:15:54.028 --> 00:15:55.995
Do we have radar reading for 0600?

194
00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:57.599
Not yet.

195
00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:00.834
Well your input and information
will be useful Doctor.


196
00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:05.238
If you can please fill in my Executive Officer
Livingston. We can send you on your way.


197
00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:07.614
Aah-ten-hut!

198
00:16:12.414 --> 00:16:14.181
As you were.

199
00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.383
Sir,

200
00:16:16.183 --> 00:16:18.143
Doctor Lisa Whitmore
called in the disaster.


201
00:16:19.754 --> 00:16:23.288
Listen doc, if there were any volcanic
activity. We would already know all about it.


202
00:16:23.289 --> 00:16:26.795
Sir, we are picking up reading
out there... It's big.


203
00:16:27.595 --> 00:16:29.264
Is it a storm?

204
00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:32.073
Excuse me Colonel but you
are not looking at a storm.


205
00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:34.401
You are looking at
an eruption column.


206
00:16:34.402 --> 00:16:36.403
What?

207
00:16:36.404 --> 00:16:40.907
Kaula has been a dead volcanic island
for millions of years until now.


208
00:16:40.908 --> 00:16:45.611
Colonel, my colleague was on
that island when it erupted.


209
00:16:45.612 --> 00:16:47.880
Please let me help.

210
00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:51.315
If you want to help, you can fill in my XO
with everything you know. Starting with...


211
00:16:51.316 --> 00:16:53.721
How did this dead island
suddenly wake up?


212
00:16:54.521 --> 00:16:57.691
My colleague had a similar theory.

213
00:16:57.692 --> 00:17:00.627
Mt. Kilauea has not shown
activity for over a year.


214
00:17:00.628 --> 00:17:04.631
But after thirty years of activity
that pressure has to go somewhere.


215
00:17:04.632 --> 00:17:10.804
Sometimes there are connecting passages where
heat and pressure travel along the crust.


216
00:17:10.805 --> 00:17:16.876
Massive amounts of pressure are forcing
submerged volcanoes to come to the surface.


217
00:17:16.877 --> 00:17:20.716
Colonel. This is
only the beginning.


218
00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:23.317
And it's only gonna get worse.

219
00:17:24.117 --> 00:17:27.294
I am the best that you have.
You need me here.


220
00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:35.327
Get set up. Keep me informed.

221
00:17:35.328 --> 00:17:37.133
Thank you Sir.

222
00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:42.268
Sir, ten minutes ago I was notified
the Lihue Airport lost contact with


223
00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:46.239
one of their airliners coming in
from LAX forty miles off course.


224
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.741
This would put it minutes
after the eruptions.


225
00:17:48.742 --> 00:17:51.576
They overshot their destination.
They're flying blind into a disaster.


226
00:17:51.577 --> 00:17:53.257
They need immediate
rescue assistance.


227
00:17:54.981 --> 00:17:59.086
I cannot initiate an air rescue over
erupting volcanoes and risk my men.


228
00:17:59.087 --> 00:18:01.654
As of now, this island is
in a state of emergency.


229
00:18:01.655 --> 00:18:04.091
Understood, I can notify the island.
Evacuation can be under


230
00:18:04.092 --> 00:18:05.959
way as soon as you
give the order Sir.


231
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.185
Get on it! Get Johnson on the
ground to handle the evac.


232
00:18:08.186 --> 00:18:10.529
Sir, with your permission I'd
like to assist in the evac.


233
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:16.271
Specialist, I admire your ambition, but
you're not ready son. Get back to your radio.


234
00:18:18.071 --> 00:18:19.171
Yes sir.

235
00:18:24.912 --> 00:18:26.579
What are you waiting for?

236
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.814
Make your calls.

237
00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:28.915
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.


238
00:18:33.554 --> 00:18:34.654
OK.

239
00:18:36.523 --> 00:18:37.697
Come on.

240
00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:44.066
Everybody hang on!

241
00:18:56.777 --> 00:18:57.676
Come on.

242
00:18:57.677 --> 00:18:59.323
Pull up! Pull up!

243
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.405
Hey somebody come up here
and help us. He's hurt!


244
00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:26.575
Is everybody OK?

245
00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:29.912
No.

246
00:19:30.712 --> 00:19:33.445
OK do we have a first
aid kit on board?


247
00:19:33.446 --> 00:19:34.913
Yeah. Yeah.

248
00:19:34.914 --> 00:19:36.682
Where's the intercom?

249
00:19:36.683 --> 00:19:38.252
It's right there.

250
00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:42.389
Uh everybody, Just remain calm.

251
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.692
Alright first aid is gonna come
around to those who need it.


252
00:19:46.693 --> 00:19:48.961
The best way to get
through this is to


253
00:19:48.962 --> 00:19:52.968
relax and try to work together..

254
00:19:54.768 --> 00:19:56.644
Good luck.

255
00:20:06.113 --> 00:20:07.213
Oh my arm!

256
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:10.543
Can you help me to move
this out of the way?


257
00:20:11.185 --> 00:20:12.285
- Aah!
- It's broken.


258
00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:17.857
Hang in there.

259
00:20:17.858 --> 00:20:19.826
- Do it. Do it! Do it!
- OK.


260
00:20:19.827 --> 00:20:21.729
1. 2. 3.

261
00:20:24.831 --> 00:20:25.899
Breathe. Breathe.

262
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.366
Just breathe. Just breathe.

263
00:20:27.367 --> 00:20:28.467
You're OK.

264
00:20:29.737 --> 00:20:30.937
Can you use this as a splint?

265
00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.842
You're OK. You get me the ace.

266
00:20:34.642 --> 00:20:36.375
You're OK. You're alright.

267
00:20:36.376 --> 00:20:37.476
We got it.

268
00:20:37.912 --> 00:20:39.248
Who's flying this plane?

269
00:20:42.048 --> 00:20:44.351
Sure ain't a pilot.

270
00:20:44.352 --> 00:20:46.353
Hey what's your problem man?

271
00:20:46.354 --> 00:20:50.659
The pilot has been
unconscious for a while.


272
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.662
It doesn't take much to
realize that he's dead.


273
00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:57.497
The pilot's dead?

274
00:20:57.498 --> 00:20:59.464
Hey! Stop it.

275
00:20:59.465 --> 00:21:00.565
Just ignore him.

276
00:21:01.536 --> 00:21:03.096
What about the co-pilot? Is he OK?

277
00:21:05.205 --> 00:21:09.198
Don't waste your breath. They
are dead. Aren't they Rita?


278
00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:33.813
Listen Crieger, do
yourself a favor.


279
00:21:34.639 --> 00:21:39.668
Shut up. Sit down or
I'll put you down.


280
00:21:43.443 --> 00:21:44.690
OK.

281
00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.795
Hey. My buddy.

282
00:22:00.595 --> 00:22:01.695
You OK?

283
00:22:02.896 --> 00:22:06.969
I need a favor from you. I need
you to hold on to this for me.


284
00:22:07.769 --> 00:22:09.136
Cool.

285
00:22:09.936 --> 00:22:13.338
And I need you to protect mama.

286
00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:16.979
You do that? I'm counting
on you. Tony macaroni.


287
00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:20.681
Boo-yah.

288
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.152
Thank you.

289
00:22:24.952 --> 00:22:26.293
You're welcome.

290
00:22:33.093 --> 00:22:35.698
You're gonna want to get
your people to Oahu.


291
00:22:37.498 --> 00:22:40.333
You need to get them out
of volcanoes range.


292
00:22:40.334 --> 00:22:42.134
It seems like a good
place to start.


293
00:22:42.135 --> 00:22:43.506
Evac is within the hour.

294
00:22:45.306 --> 00:22:48.508
Good. Secondly, we're going to need to
shoot probe into one of the volcanoes...


295
00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:50.710
If you think I'm going to send
one of my men near those...


296
00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:55.382
All I'm suggesting is to launch a
probe into one of the volcanoes.


297
00:22:55.383 --> 00:22:56.982
So I can better understand them.

298
00:22:56.983 --> 00:22:58.985
What exactly can we
learn from the probe?


299
00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:02.489
Oceanic temperature, Aerial
temperatures, and seismic disturbances.


300
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.094
I may be able to predict
what they'll do next.


301
00:23:06.894 --> 00:23:08.127
That's a go people.

302
00:23:08.128 --> 00:23:10.364
15 minutes to airborne.

303
00:23:11.164 --> 00:23:14.068
Sir. What about the
commercial airline sir?


304
00:23:14.868 --> 00:23:19.172
We may get a visual of it. If we do that
will better help us coordinate a rescue.


305
00:23:19.173 --> 00:23:23.010
Until you get someone on the comm,
focus on your current mission soldier.


306
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.088
Yes, sir.

307
00:23:34.888 --> 00:23:36.455
Work.

308
00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:37.556
Come on.

309
00:23:40.126 --> 00:23:41.226
Of course.

310
00:23:44.565 --> 00:23:47.001
Alright. What exactly are
you doing to that phone?


311
00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:50.036
I'm gutting it... gonna
try to call for help.


312
00:23:50.037 --> 00:23:51.397
Wait wait wait wait a minute.

313
00:23:51.571 --> 00:23:53.772
The phones or the Wi-Fi
they don't work up here.


314
00:23:53.773 --> 00:23:55.941
Well, not entirely.

315
00:23:55.942 --> 00:23:59.016
See all these lines are connected to a
link, which is routed to a satellite,


316
00:23:59.017 --> 00:24:00.779
down to a designated target.

317
00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.017
Right now that link is being rejected
because the communications are down.


318
00:24:04.018 --> 00:24:08.453
It's kinda like an unregistered user
trying to get in access, you know?


319
00:24:08.454 --> 00:24:14.696
But if I can by pass that link to the
satellite, I might allow ourselves access.


320
00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:16.828
This will work?

321
00:24:16.829 --> 00:24:18.998
Well, I'll let you know.

322
00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:20.099
OK.

323
00:24:21.802 --> 00:24:24.636
Specialist Tully, What's the
status on the evac of Niihau?


324
00:24:24.637 --> 00:24:27.237
Not great sir. They're running
in to a few snags. The locals


325
00:24:27.541 --> 00:24:29.776
think they can handle
it themselves.


326
00:24:29.777 --> 00:24:32.851
I don't care if they have to drag people
by their feet. Get it taken care of


327
00:24:32.852 --> 00:24:34.480
and get their asses back
to base. Understood?


328
00:24:34.481 --> 00:24:35.347
Sir.

329
00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:37.687
The bird is in-bound.

330
00:24:40.487 --> 00:24:45.429
Niihau control, this is Delta

331
00:24:48.229 --> 00:24:49.329
I have visual.

332
00:24:53.834 --> 00:24:56.704
Sir, we have picture.

333
00:24:57.504 --> 00:25:00.006
Delta 2-1 prepared to launch.

334
00:25:00.007 --> 00:25:02.477
Roger that, Delta 2-1.

335
00:25:03.277 --> 00:25:05.143
Interesting...

336
00:25:05.144 --> 00:25:06.645
What?

337
00:25:06.646 --> 00:25:08.748
The lava is superheated
and not very dense.


338
00:25:08.749 --> 00:25:11.819
The lighter the density the most
likely is to stay airborne.


339
00:25:12.619 --> 00:25:15.220
Delta 2-1. You are clear to
launch when you are ready.


340
00:25:15.221 --> 00:25:18.791
Roger. Delta 2-1,
Launching probe in...


341
00:25:18.792 --> 00:25:21.806
3-2-1 Fire!

342
00:25:32.606 --> 00:25:33.672
Direct hit.

343
00:25:33.673 --> 00:25:35.407
Good.

344
00:25:35.408 --> 00:25:36.776
Get him back to base.

345
00:25:36.777 --> 00:25:38.176
Roger that, Delta 2...

346
00:25:38.177 --> 00:25:40.246
Wait! Niihau Control,
I have a visual of...


347
00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:41.913
Delta 2-1 say again.

348
00:25:41.914 --> 00:25:44.152
A thick cloud moving fast!

349
00:25:44.952 --> 00:25:48.188
That cloud isn't just moving fast, it's
clocking in at three hundred knots!


350
00:25:48.189 --> 00:25:49.822
Tell him to get out of there now!

351
00:25:49.823 --> 00:25:51.937
Delta 2-1, return to base!
I repeat, return to base!


352
00:25:51.938 --> 00:25:53.538
Niihau Control... come in.
Come in...


353
00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:56.864
Delta 2-1, get out of there
now! Do you read me?!


354
00:25:57.664 --> 00:25:59.976
Oh my g...

355
00:26:08.776 --> 00:26:10.515
We've lost Captain Elby.

356
00:26:14.315 --> 00:26:18.193
It's still coming! It's thirty thousand
meters from Niihau and closing!


357
00:26:18.219 --> 00:26:21.656
- Twenty thousand meters.
- Who's on the shore?


358
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.391
We need to send out our boys!
Evacuate the coastal areas!


359
00:26:24.392 --> 00:26:28.495
It's too late! Call the beach
patrol and have everyone leave now!


360
00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:30.296
Do it!

361
00:26:30.564 --> 00:26:34.232
Sir, what about everyone
living on shore?


362
00:27:06.032 --> 00:27:09.101
Everyone must evacuate the beach quickly
and calmly! This is an emergency!


363
00:27:09.102 --> 00:27:15.256
Everyone must evacuate the beach quickly
and calmly! This is an emergency!


364
00:27:29.056 --> 00:27:30.156
Colonel.

365
00:27:39.567 --> 00:27:42.569
You're shores are the new Pompeii.

366
00:27:43.369 --> 00:27:48.449
All civilians that are still alive,
get them to safety. Evacuate.


367
00:27:55.249 --> 00:27:56.349
Rita.

368
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:58.257
Top gun needs you. 
He has an idea.

369
00:28:03.057 --> 00:28:04.159
Dammit.

370
00:28:04.959 --> 00:28:06.392
Are you OK?

371
00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:08.153
I need you to come
inside for a second.


372
00:28:09.829 --> 00:28:12.699
Alright, I need you to reach
underneath that panel... okay.


373
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.201
Does your hand fit inside there?

374
00:28:15.202 --> 00:28:16.602
Uh, I think so.

375
00:28:16.603 --> 00:28:18.363
OK, look in there
tell me what you see.


376
00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:21.996
Their's a mess in here.

377
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.611
Their's gonna be a circuit
breaker, in there somewhere.


378
00:28:24.612 --> 00:28:27.566
OK. their is like two ways to over
ride this auto pilot, and we lost one.


379
00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:29.315
That is the other one.

380
00:28:29.316 --> 00:28:30.849
Rick, I don't think I can do this.

381
00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.425
You can OK. Just reach in
there and feel around.


382
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.702
Careful. careful, careful!

383
00:28:49.502 --> 00:28:52.070
Ah! OK. OK, I think I found
the circuit breaker.


384
00:28:52.071 --> 00:28:53.171
OK.

385
00:28:54.102 --> 00:28:56.142
Oh my God Their's so many
switches. Which one is it?


386
00:28:56.143 --> 00:28:58.459
OK, it's going to look different
than the other switches.


387
00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:00.454
It's gonna either be color
coated or its going to


388
00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:02.135
be a totally different
switch all together.


389
00:29:02.136 --> 00:29:03.536
Do you see anything like that?

390
00:29:04.217 --> 00:29:06.219
Yea, yea... I see it!

391
00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:09.527
OK. I'm gonna do it.

392
00:29:13.327 --> 00:29:14.862
Now!

393
00:29:18.732 --> 00:29:20.100
That's not good.

394
00:29:22.837 --> 00:29:24.142
We're losing fuel.

395
00:29:28.942 --> 00:29:30.441
What, what. I'm sorry.

396
00:29:30.442 --> 00:29:32.345
Grab the wheel.

397
00:29:33.145 --> 00:29:34.780
- I can't!
- Yes you can.


398
00:29:34.781 --> 00:29:38.416
Grab that. Yes you can.
You can do it OK.


399
00:29:38.417 --> 00:29:41.456
Just relax. Hold on.

400
00:29:42.256 --> 00:29:44.163
What is that?

401
00:29:53.612 --> 00:29:54.733
I don't know what I'm doing?

402
00:29:54.734 --> 00:29:58.038
It's OK, just... Ahh! God.

403
00:29:58.838 --> 00:30:00.475
Uh, I'm sorry.

404
00:30:00.746 --> 00:30:02.980
Just if something get's in
your way, then you turn, OK?


405
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:04.219
OK.

406
00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:13.119
Rick!

407
00:30:14.555 --> 00:30:15.836
Their flying all around us.

408
00:30:17.523 --> 00:30:20.403
As long as you don't flying in them,
I don't care what their doing.


409
00:30:25.231 --> 00:30:26.638
Rick!

410
00:30:31.438 --> 00:30:34.476
OK! OK OK OK.

411
00:30:35.276 --> 00:30:36.442
Rick!

412
00:30:38.278 --> 00:30:39.945
It's getting closer.

413
00:30:39.946 --> 00:30:41.487
Ahh!

414
00:30:47.287 --> 00:30:48.387
OK. I got it.

415
00:30:57.596 --> 00:30:59.034
No more switches for you.

416
00:31:00.834 --> 00:31:05.104
That means that the other
switch has got to be...


417
00:31:05.105 --> 00:31:07.473
Ugh! Great.

418
00:31:07.474 --> 00:31:08.274
What?

419
00:31:08.275 --> 00:31:10.009
Was that not it?

420
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.211
No, no, no. That was it.. But
all the circuit are fried now.


421
00:31:12.212 --> 00:31:15.815
So that means that no way in fixing
this. We're stuck in auto-pilot.


422
00:31:16.615 --> 00:31:18.151
Rick, your hand.

423
00:31:18.152 --> 00:31:19.287
I'll be fine.

424
00:31:21.087 --> 00:31:22.422
That was close.

425
00:31:23.222 --> 00:31:25.057
Yea, It's just the beginning. Look.

426
00:31:25.058 --> 00:31:26.561
And more good news.

427
00:31:27.361 --> 00:31:29.260
How long do we have?

428
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:31.365
I'd say an hour, at best.

429
00:31:32.165 --> 00:31:33.265
Well what do we do?

430
00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:37.248
We need to check on landing.
See if their's any progress.


431
00:31:42.876 --> 00:31:45.144
Hey genius, how's it going?

432
00:31:45.145 --> 00:31:49.348
Well, I minored in genius but majored
in awesome. It's ready to transmit.


433
00:31:49.349 --> 00:31:50.682
So it works.

434
00:31:50.683 --> 00:31:51.921
Only one way to find out.

435
00:31:54.721 --> 00:31:57.756
Uh, Mayday. Mayday:

436
00:31:57.757 --> 00:32:01.426
Mayday. Mayday.
This is flight 7389.


437
00:32:01.427 --> 00:32:05.264
Flight 7389 requesting immediate
emergency assistance.


438
00:32:05.265 --> 00:32:09.843
I repeat this is fight 7389,
requesting emergency assistance.


439
00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:18.379
This is good.

440
00:32:19.179 --> 00:32:21.739
Do you really want to impress me?
Get somebody on the line.


441
00:32:21.815 --> 00:32:22.915
OK.

442
00:32:23.517 --> 00:32:27.053
Honey, Honey are you OK?

443
00:32:27.054 --> 00:32:29.421
OK. OK.

444
00:32:29.422 --> 00:32:31.258
He'll be OK.

445
00:32:32.058 --> 00:32:36.996
Hey, little buddy. I'll get
you some water, Alright?


446
00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:39.531
Their should be something for
motion sickness, I'll go see.


447
00:32:39.532 --> 00:32:40.632
Oh, OK.

448
00:32:47.208 --> 00:32:50.944
I think our new pilot
is not fit to fly.


449
00:32:51.744 --> 00:32:53.144
Where are you getting at man?

450
00:32:53.145 --> 00:32:54.245
Our pilots are dead.

451
00:32:54.748 --> 00:32:57.415
Rick has endangered us all.

452
00:32:57.416 --> 00:33:01.389
He dumped the fuel and who
know if we have enough.


453
00:33:02.189 --> 00:33:06.936
I say let the auto-pilot do
what it's made to do. Not him!


454
00:33:15.736 --> 00:33:17.706
How does it feel?

455
00:33:19.506 --> 00:33:21.009
Better thank you.

456
00:33:22.809 --> 00:33:24.742
Yeah, let's get 'em!

457
00:33:24.743 --> 00:33:25.843
What the hell is that?

458
00:33:26.512 --> 00:33:28.114
I don't know.

459
00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:34.887
You want some air?

460
00:33:34.888 --> 00:33:36.723
What?

461
00:33:36.724 --> 00:33:38.490
Hey

462
00:33:38.491 --> 00:33:40.492
What the hell are you doing?!

463
00:33:40.493 --> 00:33:42.263
What are you doing?

464
00:33:47.768 --> 00:33:49.238
You bastard!

465
00:33:52.038 --> 00:33:54.472
What the hell is going on here?
What is this?


466
00:33:54.473 --> 00:33:56.241
Your ejection.

467
00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:57.342
My what?

468
00:34:06.318 --> 00:34:07.456
Open It.

469
00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:10.757
No!

470
00:34:10.758 --> 00:34:14.594
This man has endangered
us all. Open it!


471
00:34:14.595 --> 00:34:17.999
I am not gonna throw
him off a plane.


472
00:34:18.799 --> 00:34:25.708
You are not with me then... you
will join him. Open the door!


473
00:34:28.508 --> 00:34:31.579
Crieger!!

474
00:34:32.379 --> 00:34:34.550
Drop... it!

475
00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.918
Everybody!

476
00:34:39.718 --> 00:34:42.496
Back in the cabin! Move!

477
00:34:50.296 --> 00:34:52.398
Rick... Fly.

478
00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:53.635
Yes sir.

479
00:34:55.435 --> 00:35:01.907
That man has repeatedly saved lives
and you're gonna attack him?


480
00:35:01.908 --> 00:35:04.479
He's killed us all.

481
00:35:06.279 --> 00:35:09.652
Just give me on reason and
I'll blow your head right now.


482
00:35:11.452 --> 00:35:13.021
There are children watching.

483
00:35:15.821 --> 00:35:17.291
You're right.

484
00:35:18.091 --> 00:35:19.757
You want to throw a
man out the door?


485
00:35:19.758 --> 00:35:20.963
Good role model.

486
00:35:22.763 --> 00:35:25.867
I know where exactly
where to shut you down.


487
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:28.767
Sit.

488
00:35:38.544 --> 00:35:41.981
What did you think was going to
happen when you open the door,


489
00:35:41.982 --> 00:35:44.887
when the cabin wasn't
depressurized?


490
00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:49.191
Think about that.

491
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:53.724
And don't mind the smell.

492
00:35:53.725 --> 00:35:55.331
Watch Rick.

493
00:35:57.131 --> 00:35:57.862
What?

494
00:35:57.863 --> 00:35:59.831
I said watch Rick.

495
00:35:59.832 --> 00:36:01.869
And watch him close.

496
00:36:02.669 --> 00:36:07.715
Keeping me in here isn't gonna stop
him from killing us all Marshall.


497
00:36:18.752 --> 00:36:20.854
You have a beautiful family.

498
00:36:22.654 --> 00:36:24.597
Where are they now?

499
00:36:31.397 --> 00:36:32.497
He's detained.

500
00:36:32.765 --> 00:36:34.443
Good.

501
00:36:44.243 --> 00:36:45.343
You OK?

502
00:36:45.977 --> 00:36:48.715
Yeah. Thank you for that.

503
00:36:49.515 --> 00:36:50.615
My pleasure.

504
00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:56.621
I'ma ask you this only once...

505
00:36:56.622 --> 00:36:59.258
And you tell me the truth.

506
00:37:00.058 --> 00:37:05.603
Can - you -
fly - this - plane?

507
00:37:11.403 --> 00:37:12.507
Yes.

508
00:37:13.307 --> 00:37:15.443
I can.

509
00:37:17.243 --> 00:37:19.246
I don't care about anything else.

510
00:37:20.046 --> 00:37:25.454
Just don't get us killed.

511
00:37:28.254 --> 00:37:30.990
Someone should have heard the
distress call by now, right?


512
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.228
The kid's trying.

513
00:37:35.028 --> 00:37:37.405
No doubt about that.

514
00:37:46.205 --> 00:37:51.409
Mayday. Mayday this is flight 7389
requesting immediate emergency assistance.


515
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.320
Do you copy?

516
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.690
Mayday. Mayday.
This is flight 7-3-8-9.


517
00:38:05.691 --> 00:38:09.936
Requesting immediate emergency assistance.
Is there anybody out there?


518
00:38:16.736 --> 00:38:21.373
Mayday. Mayday this is flight 7389
requesting immediate emergency assistance.


519
00:38:21.374 --> 00:38:23.010
Do you copy?

520
00:38:27.247 --> 00:38:28.820
Please somebody pick up.

521
00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.720
Tully?

522
00:38:36.656 --> 00:38:40.425
Mayday. Mayday this is flight 7389
requesting immediate emergency assistance.


523
00:38:40.426 --> 00:38:41.526
Do you copy?

524
00:38:43.095 --> 00:38:47.269
Tully, what was the Flight number
on that lost airliner again?


525
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:52.970
Flight 7389. Why?

526
00:38:52.971 --> 00:38:55.177
I think I just found them.

527
00:38:57.977 --> 00:38:59.445
Colonel Rhyker, sir.

528
00:38:59.446 --> 00:39:02.581
The airliner, we've made contact.

529
00:39:02.582 --> 00:39:04.150
Sir!

530
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.289
You're gonna wanna hear this.

531
00:39:09.089 --> 00:39:14.458
Mayday, mayday. This is Flight 7389
requesting emergency assistance.


532
00:39:14.459 --> 00:39:16.094
That's Landon! 
That's his flight.

533
00:39:16.095 --> 00:39:17.762
You know him?

534
00:39:17.763 --> 00:39:20.037
He's a friend. Was supposed
to fly in today and meet us.


535
00:39:20.038 --> 00:39:21.166
- Vaughn, get a hold of them!
- Yes sir!


536
00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:22.166
Where are they?

537
00:39:22.167 --> 00:39:23.101
That's the thing, sir...

538
00:39:23.102 --> 00:39:24.155
Thatch.

539
00:39:24.156 --> 00:39:25.340
Yes sir.

540
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.175
They're in the 7th circle of hell.

541
00:39:30.176 --> 00:39:31.978
They're lucky to be alive.

542
00:39:32.778 --> 00:39:35.012
You've gotta do something!

543
00:39:35.013 --> 00:39:38.050
We are in the middle of evacuating everyone
off the island. That's our priority.


544
00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:43.356
With all due respect sir, this is how we make
it right. We save as many as we possibly can.


545
00:39:43.357 --> 00:39:45.657
Even if we initiate an
evac rescue mission...


546
00:39:45.658 --> 00:39:51.063
the probability that we'll even
penetrate that wall of fire is unlike.


547
00:39:51.064 --> 00:39:56.335
Honestly, we're talking about a
random erupting wall. It's risky.


548
00:39:56.336 --> 00:39:58.007
But I'm not saying it's impossible.

549
00:40:00.807 --> 00:40:03.074
Flight 7-3-8-9. come in - 89.

550
00:40:03.075 --> 00:40:05.955
This is the Niihau Joint Task Force
Operations Center, do you read?


551
00:40:06.513 --> 00:40:09.516
I've got someone...
I've got someone!


552
00:40:11.316 --> 00:40:13.653
Someone's transmitting to us.

553
00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:19.458
Uh, yes, hello? Come in.
This is flight 7389!


554
00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:23.595
You're alive! Who is
this, is this Landon?


555
00:40:23.596 --> 00:40:29.668
Yes. This is Landon. How do
you know me? You know me?


556
00:40:29.669 --> 00:40:33.941
That's right. Your colleague
Dr. Whitmore is here.


557
00:40:34.741 --> 00:40:36.476
Lisa. Boy do I owe you.

558
00:40:38.276 --> 00:40:43.949
OK Listen. My name is Private Vaugh. Can
you tell me what your situation status is?


559
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:45.717
Uh sure. Situation status.

560
00:40:45.718 --> 00:40:48.619
Uh... We lost both our pilots.

561
00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.289
Uh, we nearly crashed.

562
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:54.092
We nearly blew up, and there's
this guys up here who's is


563
00:40:54.093 --> 00:40:56.594
super close to a
psychotic melt down.


564
00:40:56.595 --> 00:41:01.199
Oh! And we're flying in the
middle of a ring of volcanoes.


565
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.438
You have thoughts?

566
00:41:05.238 --> 00:41:08.775
Roger that. What's your
altitude and your fuel like?


567
00:41:09.575 --> 00:41:11.309
Uh, what's our altitude?

568
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.813
Uh, around 10,000 feet.

569
00:41:14.814 --> 00:41:19.418
We're around 10,000 feet... but
we have lost a lot of fuel.


570
00:41:19.419 --> 00:41:22.086
OK. Roger that Landon.
Sit tight for a second.


571
00:41:22.087 --> 00:41:24.088
OK sure.

572
00:41:24.089 --> 00:41:26.324
Tully Sir.

573
00:41:26.325 --> 00:41:28.695
They're outta fuel.

574
00:41:29.495 --> 00:41:31.101
Patch 'em through.

575
00:41:34.901 --> 00:41:37.802
Landon? It's Lisa.

576
00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:42.074
Lisa, It's good to hear your voice.

577
00:41:42.075 --> 00:41:43.608
Just hang in OK?

578
00:41:43.609 --> 00:41:45.342
Your gonna be fine.

579
00:41:45.343 --> 00:41:47.746
OK, we'll do our best.

580
00:41:47.747 --> 00:41:49.847
And Landon...

581
00:41:49.848 --> 00:41:52.684
Who rocks?

582
00:41:52.685 --> 00:41:54.418
You rock.

583
00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:56.621
Landon, you're outta fuel?

584
00:41:56.622 --> 00:42:02.193
Not yet but uh, we don't have a lot left.
I'd say probably less then an hour.


585
00:42:02.194 --> 00:42:05.429
OK Landon. This is
colonel Rhyker...


586
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:08.101
He's gonna tell you what to do.

587
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.170
Son...

588
00:42:12.171 --> 00:42:14.072
Just relax.

589
00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:16.440
Keep everyone calm and sit tight.

590
00:42:16.441 --> 00:42:19.195
We're gonna do everything in our
power to get you out of there safe.


591
00:42:19.196 --> 00:42:20.197
OK just one thing I...

592
00:42:20.513 --> 00:42:24.782
Based on my readings of the
quake I don't think we have a


593
00:42:24.783 --> 00:42:26.818
Landon?

594
00:42:26.819 --> 00:42:27.985
Landon?

595
00:42:27.986 --> 00:42:29.086
We've lost comm. Sir.

596
00:42:29.555 --> 00:42:30.958
Dammit!

597
00:42:31.758 --> 00:42:33.478
The ash cloud is
causing interference.


598
00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.160
Sir!

599
00:42:37.163 --> 00:42:38.837
I am urging you to
reconsider the rescue.


600
00:42:38.838 --> 00:42:40.431
Stand Special.

601
00:42:40.432 --> 00:42:42.746
Those people will die up there
if you don't do something!


602
00:42:42.747 --> 00:42:44.202
Then they're dead in the air!

603
00:42:44.203 --> 00:42:47.338
I give the orders around here.

604
00:42:47.339 --> 00:42:49.474
And my men are not dying today.

605
00:42:49.475 --> 00:42:50.909
Colonel do you think...

606
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:54.179
Speak out of line one more time.

607
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:59.220
And you will be begging me for a
court-Martial when I'm done with you.


608
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.887
Yes...

609
00:43:01.888 --> 00:43:02.990
Sir!

610
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:09.429
If you boys are done,
I've got something.


611
00:43:10.229 --> 00:43:12.977
Our probe is picking up
rising sea temperatures


612
00:43:13.003 --> 00:43:16.034
and seismic activity in
ascending intervals.


613
00:43:16.135 --> 00:43:17.269
What does that mean?

614
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.336
Meaning it's counting down.

615
00:43:19.337 --> 00:43:21.273
Counting down to what?

616
00:43:21.274 --> 00:43:23.541
Well considering the quake's
source, duration, and magnitude...


617
00:43:23.542 --> 00:43:29.181
The crust can only take so much pressure
before magma builds and punches through.


618
00:43:29.182 --> 00:43:30.916
You mean another eruption?

619
00:43:30.917 --> 00:43:34.253
Yeah. Yeah more massive
than all the others.


620
00:43:35.053 --> 00:43:36.153
And then what?

621
00:43:38.624 --> 00:43:41.494
We lose.

622
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.072
Colonel could I talk to you
over here for a second.


623
00:43:53.872 --> 00:43:55.416
Come with me.

624
00:44:04.216 --> 00:44:06.117
We are saving those people.

625
00:44:06.118 --> 00:44:07.751
Period.

626
00:44:07.752 --> 00:44:10.822
But we don't have authorization
from Colonel Rhyker.


627
00:44:10.823 --> 00:44:12.257
We do now.

628
00:44:12.258 --> 00:44:14.224
Besides, Rhyker's
busy with the island.


629
00:44:14.225 --> 00:44:16.327
That looks like the real thing.

630
00:44:16.328 --> 00:44:18.996
Rhyker can't save them but we can.

631
00:44:18.997 --> 00:44:22.035
I am not letting anybody
else die today understood?


632
00:44:22.635 --> 00:44:27.771
The people I care about are on that plane.
So you can't do this without my help.


633
00:44:27.772 --> 00:44:29.007
OK.

634
00:44:29.008 --> 00:44:31.076
First...

635
00:44:31.077 --> 00:44:33.349
We get that tanker.

636
00:44:50.263 --> 00:44:51.369
That's not good.

637
00:44:57.169 --> 00:44:58.338
The engine is jammed.

638
00:44:59.138 --> 00:45:01.210
Something is lodged inside.

639
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:05.131
I'm gonna talk to Rick.

640
00:45:06.745 --> 00:45:08.081
Wait. What?

641
00:45:08.881 --> 00:45:10.485
Everything's OK.

642
00:45:12.285 --> 00:45:13.385
It's OK.

643
00:45:18.857 --> 00:45:19.957
Tell me right now...

644
00:45:21.434 --> 00:45:23.468
Can you level this plane
with that engine clogged?


645
00:45:23.469 --> 00:45:25.262
No. Not unless...

646
00:45:25.263 --> 00:45:26.898
We fix it.

647
00:45:26.899 --> 00:45:28.266
Yeah but how?

648
00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:29.867
You send me out there.

649
00:45:29.868 --> 00:45:32.441
I can unclog that and get it going.

650
00:45:35.241 --> 00:45:37.710
Can we even open that door?

651
00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:42.246
Well we're at 10,000 feet and if I ease
back on the throttle, Yeah we can.


652
00:45:42.247 --> 00:45:44.215
What? Are you serious?

653
00:45:44.216 --> 00:45:46.021
You have a better idea?

654
00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:51.659
I need my bag. It
has my tools in it.


655
00:45:52.459 --> 00:45:55.994
Even if you do unclog it, that engine will
immediately try to suck you right back in.


656
00:45:55.995 --> 00:45:57.296
I'm seeing my wife.

657
00:45:58.096 --> 00:45:59.934
And going on vacation.

658
00:46:01.734 --> 00:46:07.539
I took time of my job, where I'm more likely
to get flattened, working on a car, she says.


659
00:46:08.339 --> 00:46:10.217
This isn't any different.

660
00:46:27.627 --> 00:46:29.463
You sure about this?

661
00:46:30.263 --> 00:46:32.032
What choice do we have?

662
00:46:33.832 --> 00:46:35.237
Ready?

663
00:46:38.037 --> 00:46:39.347
Go.

664
00:46:48.147 --> 00:46:50.150
Lift it up like this.

665
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.050
OK.

666
00:47:06.631 --> 00:47:12.374
OK here we go! Steady!
Easy easy. Hold steady!


667
00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:21.253
I'm on my way baby.

668
00:47:49.307 --> 00:47:50.809
Hold on tight.

669
00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.092
Easy!

670
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:18.941
Alright.

671
00:48:21.741 --> 00:48:22.841
Hold it!

672
00:48:44.796 --> 00:48:46.231
Come on!

673
00:48:46.232 --> 00:48:47.332
Come on.

674
00:48:47.533 --> 00:48:49.335
Come on!

675
00:48:55.374 --> 00:48:56.507
I got it!

676
00:48:56.508 --> 00:48:57.642
I got it!

677
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:05.350
Pull 'em in!

678
00:49:05.351 --> 00:49:06.383
Easy does it.

679
00:49:06.553 --> 00:49:09.496
OK! Easy!

680
00:50:04.577 --> 00:50:06.427
It's OK. It's OK.

681
00:50:21.227 --> 00:50:22.327
Frank's gone.

682
00:50:23.995 --> 00:50:25.095
I know.

683
00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:26.903
And we're loosing altitude.

684
00:50:30.703 --> 00:50:32.702
They're taking a beating up there.

685
00:50:32.703 --> 00:50:37.610
Sir, we've got an inbound bogey...
multiple bogeys heading right for us.


686
00:50:43.415 --> 00:50:44.215
Hello?

687
00:50:44.216 --> 00:50:46.351
Is anyone there?

688
00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.322
We just lost someone and 2
of our engines are out.


689
00:50:50.323 --> 00:50:52.389
Do you copy?

690
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:54.293
Is anyone there?

691
00:50:55.493 --> 00:50:58.664
Dammit. Why isn't anyone answering?

692
00:50:59.464 --> 00:51:01.465
Hello? Is anyone there?

693
00:51:01.466 --> 00:51:03.070
We read you!

694
00:51:04.504 --> 00:51:07.378
It's possible for a 747 to fly on two
engines but you may be too heavy.


695
00:51:07.379 --> 00:51:09.899
You lose another one and you'll
glide down and eventually crash.


696
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.642
What about the luggage?
We can dump all that.


697
00:51:11.643 --> 00:51:13.478
Do it! We're getting
hit hard over here.


698
00:51:13.479 --> 00:51:16.282
All hands. Get those
injured inside!


699
00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.891
Code Red! Take cover!

700
00:51:29.696 --> 00:51:31.496
Incoming!

701
00:51:50.149 --> 00:51:51.669
This is never gonna work.

702
00:52:07.033 --> 00:52:09.501
What do people put
in their luggage?


703
00:52:09.502 --> 00:52:13.010
Get the wounded inside!
get inside now!


704
00:52:30.388 --> 00:52:31.488
Thatch come here!

705
00:52:32.557 --> 00:52:34.397
Grab him from the other side.
Get him up!


706
00:52:35.627 --> 00:52:37.367
Aah!

707
00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:44.769
- Get him inside!
- I'm on my way now!


708
00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.304
I'm not going anywhere.

709
00:52:46.305 --> 00:52:49.014
Tully! Tully we need your help!
Come with me.


710
00:52:54.814 --> 00:52:55.914
That should do it.

711
00:52:56.682 --> 00:52:57.916
Everything's gone.

712
00:52:57.917 --> 00:52:59.017
Did it do anything?

713
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:04.594
Nope. We're still too heavy.

714
00:53:48.567 --> 00:53:49.934
Hey.

715
00:53:49.935 --> 00:53:51.601
No word from base yet.

716
00:53:51.602 --> 00:53:53.639
We're still too heavy.

717
00:53:54.439 --> 00:53:57.507
If I were a plane what
could I get rid of?


718
00:53:57.508 --> 00:54:00.744
Something that's useless
and we no longer need.


719
00:54:00.745 --> 00:54:02.581
Crieger would be nice.

720
00:54:02.582 --> 00:54:03.682
Look out!

721
00:54:14.058 --> 00:54:15.197
Sit down. Buckle up.

722
00:54:18.997 --> 00:54:21.405
Ladies and gentlemen take
your seats and buckle up.


723
00:54:21.431 --> 00:54:23.598
This is about to get
very interesting.


724
00:54:28.473 --> 00:54:29.573
What are you doing?

725
00:54:30.255 --> 00:54:31.849
Getting rid of some
unwanted equipment.


726
00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:33.516
What?

727
00:54:38.316 --> 00:54:41.851
Rick, listen to me! You can't do this!
You're gonna get us killed!


728
00:54:41.852 --> 00:54:42.720
Not today!

729
00:54:42.721 --> 00:54:44.495
I have a lot of things that
I want to do with my life.


730
00:54:44.521 --> 00:54:46.990
- I'm begging you please. Do not this!
- Here it comes.


731
00:54:46.991 --> 00:54:48.362
No no no no no!

732
00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:00.211
You are going to kill us!

733
00:55:15.053 --> 00:55:17.855
How do you not do
this professionally?!


734
00:55:17.856 --> 00:55:21.195
I buckle under official status.

735
00:55:22.995 --> 00:55:24.829
We stopped descending at 4,000 ft.

736
00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:27.074
Whoo!

737
00:55:34.874 --> 00:55:36.008
Excuse me Colonel?

738
00:55:36.808 --> 00:55:37.978
May I ask you something?

739
00:55:38.778 --> 00:55:39.710
Over here?

740
00:55:39.711 --> 00:55:41.313
Let's make it quick.

741
00:55:47.352 --> 00:55:48.920
Hey are you there?

742
00:55:48.921 --> 00:55:50.556
Yeah. I've been
trying to reach you.


743
00:55:50.557 --> 00:55:52.123
We managed to level the plane out.

744
00:55:52.124 --> 00:55:53.257
How did you do that?

745
00:55:53.258 --> 00:55:55.992
Uh, we took off 2 of the engines?

746
00:55:55.993 --> 00:55:58.764
Uh, Wow! Uh,...

747
00:55:59.564 --> 00:56:01.666
OK what's you altitude?

748
00:56:01.667 --> 00:56:03.570
4,000 ft.

749
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.744
That's cutting it a little too close
for our tanker. We're calling him off.


750
00:56:06.745 --> 00:56:08.546
Don't worry. We still
have rescue coming.


751
00:56:10.209 --> 00:56:12.129
Call of the tanker.
It's way too dangerous.


752
00:56:12.544 --> 00:56:15.347
Hope you're getting
some one equally crazy.


753
00:56:15.348 --> 00:56:18.115
Don't worry. We're
getting our best.


754
00:56:18.116 --> 00:56:20.720
Alright. What's your ETA?
When can I expect ya?


755
00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.021
Give me 15 minutes.

756
00:56:23.022 --> 00:56:25.090
15 minutes? OK that's
cutting it a little close.


757
00:56:25.091 --> 00:56:26.824
I think we've only got about 30.

758
00:56:26.825 --> 00:56:27.824
Roger that.

759
00:56:27.825 --> 00:56:29.503
Tully out.

760
00:56:38.303 --> 00:56:41.340
Please let me be wrong.

761
00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.809
This is Ronald 2-5 inbound.

762
00:56:44.609 --> 00:56:46.177
Roger that bravo 2-5.

763
00:56:46.178 --> 00:56:47.577
Boys be careful out there huh?

764
00:56:47.578 --> 00:56:49.483
Roger control.

765
00:56:51.283 --> 00:56:53.284
Targets in sight, 
Niihau control.

766
00:56:53.285 --> 00:56:57.121
Roger that, Bravo 2-5.
Tread lightly once inside.


767
00:56:57.122 --> 00:56:58.222
Walk in the park.

768
00:56:58.557 --> 00:57:01.996
I see an opening, control.
Bravo 2- 5 going in.


769
00:57:04.796 --> 00:57:05.898
Control, we're in.

770
00:57:07.492 --> 00:57:09.806
Roger that, Bravo 2-5. Do you
have visual of the package?


771
00:57:09.807 --> 00:57:12.936
Roger, control. 
We have visual.

772
00:57:12.937 --> 00:57:16.141
Roger that. Good luck.

773
00:57:16.142 --> 00:57:18.978
Bravo 2-5 setting her
under the cargo hold.


774
00:57:19.778 --> 00:57:21.014
Landon?

775
00:57:22.461 --> 00:57:24.655
A rescue plane is right blow you.
You're gonna have to


776
00:57:24.656 --> 00:57:26.576
lower passengers from your
cargo hold understand?


777
00:57:26.577 --> 00:57:28.592
OK I'm getting everyone
together right now.


778
00:57:33.392 --> 00:57:35.860
Help's here. They want
us in the cargo hold.


779
00:57:35.861 --> 00:57:37.027
You're kidding?

780
00:57:37.028 --> 00:57:39.164
No. I don't joke about rescues.

781
00:57:39.165 --> 00:57:40.398
Alright, I'll catch up.

782
00:57:40.399 --> 00:57:42.766
Bravo 2-5. Collecting the package.

783
00:57:42.767 --> 00:57:44.104
Roger that.

784
00:57:58.249 --> 00:57:59.753
Let's go let's go let's go!

785
00:58:02.553 --> 00:58:04.257
OK, ready?

786
00:58:05.057 --> 00:58:06.391
Alright.

787
00:58:07.139 --> 00:58:09.133
We are receiving our
first passenger.


788
00:58:09.134 --> 00:58:11.199
Roger that Bravo 2-5.

789
00:58:14.999 --> 00:58:15.932
Are you good?

790
00:58:15.933 --> 00:58:17.093
Stay right here alright?

791
00:58:17.736 --> 00:58:21.443
Control, we're losing
daylight out here.


792
00:58:24.243 --> 00:58:27.585
You'll be alright. You got it.

793
00:58:33.385 --> 00:58:34.554
Man.

794
00:58:37.123 --> 00:58:39.197
We're experiencing some
lighting over here control.


795
00:58:39.198 --> 00:58:41.728
Roger that Bravo 2-5.
What do you got?


796
00:58:42.528 --> 00:58:46.297
The ash cloud's giving off some
heavy electrical activity.


797
00:58:46.298 --> 00:58:49.400
Bravo 2-5 double time it. Copy?

798
00:58:49.401 --> 00:58:51.335
You!

799
00:58:51.336 --> 00:58:54.570
Sir! We're getting the passengers on the
rescue plane. Vaughn pull up on screen.


800
00:58:54.571 --> 00:58:56.307
Double-time it.

801
00:58:57.107 --> 00:58:58.207
Alright, ready buddy?

802
00:58:58.577 --> 00:59:00.277
Give us two minutes, sir, please!

803
00:59:00.278 --> 00:59:03.780
Alright at the count of 3. 1...

804
00:59:03.781 --> 00:59:05.217
2...

805
00:59:10.254 --> 00:59:11.824
Control, we are hit!

806
00:59:17.595 --> 00:59:20.144
We're going down! 
We're going down!

807
00:59:32.944 --> 00:59:34.882
Explain yourself specialist.

808
00:59:37.682 --> 00:59:39.384
Sir...

809
00:59:39.385 --> 00:59:42.059
You really thought this could work?
By deliberately disobeying me?


810
00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:44.220
And by forging orders
to issue this mission?


811
00:59:44.221 --> 00:59:47.590
You and your team are
relieved of duty.


812
00:59:47.591 --> 00:59:48.458
Sir...

813
00:59:48.459 --> 00:59:49.961
You will be court martialed.

814
00:59:50.761 --> 00:59:52.862
Now get to your station
and wait there.


815
00:59:52.863 --> 00:59:54.103
The MP's are on their way.

816
00:59:54.566 --> 00:59:57.333
And get that off the screen.

817
00:59:57.334 --> 00:59:59.184
Get it off!

818
01:00:29.635 --> 01:00:30.768
Hey everyone.

819
01:00:30.769 --> 01:00:33.436
Umm...

820
01:00:33.437 --> 01:00:37.277
I got this thing to
transmit and uh...


821
01:00:38.077 --> 01:00:41.978
If you have something that
you want to say to someone,


822
01:00:41.979 --> 01:00:43.199
Feel free.

823
01:00:59.999 --> 01:01:02.737
Is there anyone that you
want to say something to?


824
01:01:06.537 --> 01:01:14.144
It's not over! I don't understand how
you can stand there and think that!


825
01:01:14.145 --> 01:01:15.882
How could you not?

826
01:01:16.682 --> 01:01:19.820
Just let me fly.

827
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.066
OK.

828
01:01:34.866 --> 01:01:36.266
MP!

829
01:01:36.267 --> 01:01:37.905
Remove that man!

830
01:01:40.705 --> 01:01:41.972
Colonel...

831
01:01:41.973 --> 01:01:44.878
- You can't do this!
- I don't want to hear it.


832
01:01:46.678 --> 01:01:50.215
No. No! You don't understand!

833
01:01:50.224 --> 01:01:53.258
Something within the ring of the
volcano is growing rapidly.


834
01:01:53.359 --> 01:01:56.786
- I'm warning you doctor.
- Colonel just... just look.


835
01:01:56.787 --> 01:02:01.191
The pressure...is all
congregating in one spot.


836
01:02:01.192 --> 01:02:05.862
And it's only a matter of time before
this thing rises. And it's big!


837
01:02:05.863 --> 01:02:09.333
Roughly 3 miles in diameter.
Just look! Take a look.


838
01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:11.300
You're done! MP?

839
01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:13.369
- You need to hear this!
- Take 'em both away.


840
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:15.345
- No! Wait! You don't understand!
- Just look!


841
01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.811
Vaughn patch it through!

842
01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:22.248
Hi my name is Landon Todd.

843
01:02:23.048 --> 01:02:26.586
I hope somebody's
listening to this.


844
01:02:27.386 --> 01:02:29.755
I never got to see my dad much...

845
01:02:31.555 --> 01:02:35.963
Not a day goes by that I wish I just
spent more time being with him.


846
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:40.630
Dad if you could hear this I
just want you to know that I


847
01:02:40.631 --> 01:02:42.903
never thought you
were a bad father.


848
01:02:45.703 --> 01:02:50.010
And I wish we could make
up for lost time...


849
01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:54.213
But I guess this is what we got.

850
01:02:58.515 --> 01:03:00.153
I love you pops!

851
01:03:01.953 --> 01:03:04.327
Not a day goes by that
I feel differently.


852
01:03:09.127 --> 01:03:11.229
Do you hear them Colonel?

853
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:14.264
I don't know what to say...

854
01:03:14.265 --> 01:03:16.666
My name is Shirley Jones...

855
01:03:16.667 --> 01:03:20.639
And I'm 67 years old.

856
01:03:21.439 --> 01:03:29.045
I's like to believe that my husband George
can hear this but he can't... he's gone.


857
01:03:29.046 --> 01:03:33.251
I see you when I close my eyes.

858
01:03:33.252 --> 01:03:38.289
And you are so beautiful.

859
01:03:40.658 --> 01:03:43.561
I'll be with you soon.

860
01:03:54.104 --> 01:03:56.106
We can save them.

861
01:03:56.107 --> 01:04:00.112
You can save them.

862
01:04:00.912 --> 01:04:03.581
Please...

863
01:04:04.381 --> 01:04:07.150
Please...

864
01:04:07.151 --> 01:04:13.626
If anyone can hear
this please help us!


865
01:04:15.426 --> 01:04:18.865
I have my child...

866
01:04:19.665 --> 01:04:22.168
a little boy.

867
01:04:22.968 --> 01:04:26.170
I have my little boy.

868
01:04:26.171 --> 01:04:28.173
Please...

869
01:04:28.973 --> 01:04:32.976
He's only 8 years old
for Christ Sake!


870
01:04:32.977 --> 01:04:34.280
Please!

871
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:41.287
Please if anyone can hear
this, please help us...


872
01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:44.458
Help us.

873
01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:48.829
We can't just let them die.

874
01:04:51.629 --> 01:04:53.934
I don't think you can either.

875
01:04:55.734 --> 01:04:58.371
Help me!

876
01:05:00.171 --> 01:05:02.409
Help them.

877
01:05:04.209 --> 01:05:05.512
Men...

878
01:05:07.312 --> 01:05:08.813
We have a duty.

879
01:05:09.613 --> 01:05:12.248
And that is to protect our people.

880
01:05:12.249 --> 01:05:13.822
No matter how dangerous.

881
01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:19.724
Sergeant Graham?

882
01:05:20.524 --> 01:05:21.925
Ready the jets.

883
01:05:21.926 --> 01:05:23.595
Yes Sir!

884
01:05:24.002 --> 01:05:26.236
Sir, by doing this you will
be disobeying state orders.


885
01:05:26.237 --> 01:05:29.634
Besides, what you are
talking about is suicide.


886
01:05:29.635 --> 01:05:31.434
Are these people
really worth the risk?


887
01:05:31.435 --> 01:05:34.472
We're not only saving them...

888
01:05:35.272 --> 01:05:36.746
We're saving all of us.

889
01:05:41.546 --> 01:05:42.748
And you...

890
01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:45.385
Back to your post, Specialist.

891
01:05:47.185 --> 01:05:49.592
Yes Sir!

892
01:06:00.231 --> 01:06:02.132
This bitch is heating up.

893
01:06:02.133 --> 01:06:04.905
Giving us a hell of a
lot of turbulence.


894
01:06:06.705 --> 01:06:10.407
They're scared. And so am I.

895
01:06:10.408 --> 01:06:12.342
Don't be.

896
01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:14.316
Sit.

897
01:06:18.116 --> 01:06:20.952
Listen...

898
01:06:21.752 --> 01:06:25.789
You're going to make
it to you families.


899
01:06:25.790 --> 01:06:30.706
We're all gonna make
it through this.


900
01:06:42.506 --> 01:06:49.083
The only thing I love in this world
is a picture of my wife and kids.


901
01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:55.652
After I was told they
were taken from me...


902
01:06:55.653 --> 01:06:57.923
I kept flying.

903
01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:04.293
S-Somehow I could turn back time
and they'd be waiting for me...


904
01:07:04.294 --> 01:07:06.066
when I landed...

905
01:07:07.866 --> 01:07:12.436
I'm gonna keep on flying.

906
01:07:12.437 --> 01:07:17.208
Not for my family... but for us.

907
01:07:17.209 --> 01:07:19.610
For all of us.

908
01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:24.081
This is not the time to say your
goodbyes or your prayers...


909
01:07:24.082 --> 01:07:28.184
This is the time to
gather your courage!


910
01:07:28.185 --> 01:07:31.726
We're gonna face thing head on!

911
01:07:34.526 --> 01:07:36.295
I can still fly.

912
01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:39.266
I can still fly.

913
01:07:42.066 --> 01:07:48.140
The only way we beat them is if we relieve
pressure from their magma chamber here.


914
01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.143
This is where we focus our attack.

915
01:07:52.144 --> 01:07:54.878
Easier said than done, Doctor.
We won't stand a chance.


916
01:07:54.879 --> 01:08:01.083
Several direct hits to their core will
rupture enough passages to release the magma


917
01:08:01.084 --> 01:08:05.024
From its base in to the
ocean, killing the eruptions.


918
01:08:05.524 --> 01:08:08.360
We just might have
a chance. Questions?


919
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.295
Good Luck.

920
01:08:11.095 --> 01:08:12.896
You don't have to do this Sir.

921
01:08:12.897 --> 01:08:14.630
We have plenty of our guys
suited up and ready to go.


922
01:08:14.631 --> 01:08:19.036
Soldier, these are my men and
I'll lead them how I see fit.


923
01:08:19.037 --> 01:08:19.936
Yes Sir!

924
01:08:19.937 --> 01:08:21.448
Now get your ass back to BDOC.

925
01:08:30.248 --> 01:08:31.314
Sir...

926
01:08:31.315 --> 01:08:32.815
I got us a rescue team.

927
01:08:32.816 --> 01:08:35.152
The plane is a little bulky

928
01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:38.707
But it flies on props so they won't have any
problems flying through the ash in the air.


929
01:08:38.708 --> 01:08:38.855
It's perfect.

930
01:08:38.856 --> 01:08:40.990
Yes they are.

931
01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:44.795
They practically jumped at the opportunity.
But they are a little extreme though.


932
01:08:44.796 --> 01:08:46.762
We're did you get these guys?

933
01:08:46.763 --> 01:08:48.966
Few of our boys, a couple
I know personally,


934
01:08:48.967 --> 01:08:52.738
They have a knack for extreme skydiving, so
they just called in a favor for the prop.


935
01:08:53.538 --> 01:08:55.238
Excellent Private. Excellent!

936
01:08:55.239 --> 01:08:56.339
Thank you Sir!

937
01:09:10.922 --> 01:09:13.462
This is red wing leader.

938
01:09:18.262 --> 01:09:19.501
Roger that.

939
01:09:23.301 --> 01:09:24.467
Okie dokie.

940
01:09:24.468 --> 01:09:27.237
I found this parachute
and this raft.


941
01:09:27.238 --> 01:09:29.073
We're gonna take this parachute...

942
01:09:29.873 --> 01:09:35.246
connect it to the raft and then we're
all gonna ride down to the ocean.


943
01:09:35.247 --> 01:09:37.648
And then we're gonna paddle
like hell to safety.


944
01:09:41.252 --> 01:09:44.188
Not everybody can fit
on that raft Jim.


945
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:45.989
We're gonna get women
and kid off first.


946
01:10:02.406 --> 01:10:04.675
OK.

947
01:10:04.676 --> 01:10:09.680
I want all the women, and little Tony follow
me to the cargo. We're getting off this bird!


948
01:10:10.981 --> 01:10:12.749
You sure this is gonna work?

949
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:14.217
I'll let you know.

950
01:10:14.218 --> 01:10:16.721
I don't think so.

951
01:10:17.521 --> 01:10:21.726
If anybody is getting
off this plane... it's me!


952
01:10:24.861 --> 01:10:27.463
Crieger! Crieger! Stop it!

953
01:10:27.464 --> 01:10:28.565
Stop!

954
01:10:30.702 --> 01:10:32.036
Everybody get down!

955
01:11:07.806 --> 01:11:09.912
One more step...

956
01:11:22.253 --> 01:11:24.957
You never could see
things my way right?


957
01:12:32.757 --> 01:12:34.728
Tony Macaroni.

958
01:12:37.528 --> 01:12:40.396
You're still taking care of mommy?

959
01:12:40.397 --> 01:12:43.072
We don't want anything
to happen to her, right?


960
01:12:47.872 --> 01:12:52.090
I...I have a grandson...

961
01:12:53.716 --> 01:12:55.947
about the same age as you.

962
01:12:57.448 --> 01:13:03.118
He always holds my hand...
even when I go to sleep.


963
01:13:03.119 --> 01:13:08.332
I don't know why,
but he always does.


964
01:13:15.732 --> 01:13:18.447
Boo-ya.

965
01:13:30.247 --> 01:13:35.890
I... I'm going to rest for...
for a little while, OK?


966
01:13:52.869 --> 01:13:54.376
Holy mother of...

967
01:13:58.176 --> 01:13:59.276
They're huge!

968
01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:02.084
This is red wing leader.
All fighters check in.


969
01:14:02.085 --> 01:14:03.313
Red Wing 1, standing by.

970
01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.047
Red Wing 3, standing by.

971
01:14:05.048 --> 01:14:07.252
Red Wing 5, standing by.

972
01:14:09.086 --> 01:14:11.055
OK. Gotta get in gotta move fast!

973
01:14:11.056 --> 01:14:12.992
It's your party Red wing leader.

974
01:14:14.792 --> 01:14:17.832
Roger that. Men... lock on their cores.
Red Wings, going in hot!


975
01:14:28.305 --> 01:14:30.073
Crieger's taken the raft.

976
01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:31.677
Let him.

977
01:14:45.123 --> 01:14:46.559
Look!

978
01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:49.459
Yes!

979
01:14:55.967 --> 01:14:58.435
Ladies and Gentlemen
help has arrived!


980
01:14:58.436 --> 01:15:00.756
Everybody hand on! This is
going to get really bumpy.


981
01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.274
Strap in.

982
01:15:04.074 --> 01:15:05.311
You good?

983
01:15:08.111 --> 01:15:09.211
Bring it on.

984
01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.686
Red Wings, engage!

985
01:15:15.486 --> 01:15:17.185
They're everywhere.

986
01:15:17.186 --> 01:15:18.659
I'm going in.

987
01:15:22.459 --> 01:15:24.130
Come on! Open wide!

988
01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:28.497
Dammit Red Wings,
lay down the fire!


989
01:15:28.498 --> 01:15:31.502
Roger that! Red Wing 3, box 1!

990
01:15:31.503 --> 01:15:34.374
Red Wing 5, box 2!

991
01:15:37.174 --> 01:15:38.275
Dammit!

992
01:15:39.075 --> 01:15:40.515
I can't get a clear shot at it.

993
01:15:45.048 --> 01:15:47.149
The target is set!

994
01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:48.753
I can't see 'em.

995
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:55.591
We're losing men left and right.

996
01:15:55.592 --> 01:15:57.864
Wider missiles. 
Wider Missiles.

997
01:16:00.664 --> 01:16:03.167
Red Wing leader, lady down
cover fire for that plane.


998
01:16:03.168 --> 01:16:05.467
I'm sending evac with
a few firecrackers.


999
01:16:05.468 --> 01:16:08.982
Get on the comm and tell those guys to ready
explosives to be stuffed in to that plane.


1000
01:16:08.983 --> 01:16:10.474
What are you nuts?

1001
01:16:10.475 --> 01:16:12.510
Yeah.

1002
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:15.177
Alright, I'm on it.

1003
01:16:15.178 --> 01:16:17.247
You head him, let's plow the road!

1004
01:16:31.262 --> 01:16:34.863
Fly & Tow, Fly & Tow!
This is base, come in?


1005
01:16:34.864 --> 01:16:36.199
Read you, Base.

1006
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.833
Do you have any
explosives on board?


1007
01:16:37.834 --> 01:16:40.028
That's an affirmative! Never
leave home with out them.


1008
01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:43.307
Good! I think they
may come in handy.


1009
01:16:44.107 --> 01:16:45.842
This is gonna be close!

1010
01:16:45.843 --> 01:16:47.278
Look out!

1011
01:16:55.186 --> 01:16:59.594
I'm hit! I'm hit! Red
Wing 3, ejecting!


1012
01:17:03.394 --> 01:17:06.296
I'm hit! I'm going down!
I'm going down!


1013
01:17:06.297 --> 01:17:08.832
Eject, dammit, eject!

1014
01:17:10.833 --> 01:17:12.268
Oh I miss Los Angeles.

1015
01:17:12.269 --> 01:17:13.869
We're that damn Evac?

1016
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:16.072
There're getting killed out there!

1017
01:17:16.073 --> 01:17:18.787
Fly & Tow, Fly & Tow! Get your asses
in there now! What's your eta?


1018
01:17:18.788 --> 01:17:22.112
ETA is 1 minute, Control,
ready and packing!


1019
01:17:22.113 --> 01:17:23.213
Roger that!

1020
01:17:23.547 --> 01:17:25.627
Red Wing Leader, you have
less than one minute!


1021
01:17:33.091 --> 01:17:35.341
Times up.

1022
01:18:18.202 --> 01:18:20.136
Oh... my...

1023
01:18:20.137 --> 01:18:22.252
You are a big bitch.

1024
01:19:08.819 --> 01:19:10.639
Yudo time to fly!

1025
01:19:28.439 --> 01:19:31.006
Help is here! But
what are they doing?


1026
01:19:31.007 --> 01:19:33.377
They're towing you out of there!

1027
01:19:33.378 --> 01:19:34.444
What?

1028
01:19:34.445 --> 01:19:36.248
Is that safe?

1029
01:19:38.048 --> 01:19:40.721
We have the package! Towing now!

1030
01:19:49.726 --> 01:19:52.497
There's too much wind
resistance on that plane.


1031
01:19:53.297 --> 01:19:54.618
We're gonna have to drop it.

1032
01:19:54.731 --> 01:19:55.966
Hurry you asses up!

1033
01:19:56.766 --> 01:19:58.402
Yes Sir!

1034
01:19:59.202 --> 01:20:00.302
We're going in again!

1035
01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:03.172
Get every soul of that plane!

1036
01:20:08.812 --> 01:20:12.015
Hey! Hey! take my son!

1037
01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:13.626
Go go go!

1038
01:20:21.426 --> 01:20:24.703
Receiving our 1st 2 passengers.

1039
01:20:41.645 --> 01:20:43.185
Go! Go! Go! Get them out now!

1040
01:20:48.985 --> 01:20:52.132
Control! We can't stay
here much longer!


1041
01:21:01.932 --> 01:21:03.032
Go go go!

1042
01:21:03.766 --> 01:21:06.168
Get back on board now!

1043
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:07.305
What's in the bag?

1044
01:21:09.105 --> 01:21:12.341
Enough explosives to blow this
bastard back to where it came from!


1045
01:21:12.342 --> 01:21:13.810
Are you guys crazy?

1046
01:21:13.811 --> 01:21:16.612
- We've been told!
- That's everybody come on!


1047
01:21:16.613 --> 01:21:20.350
No we're not leaving
without Rick. Rick!


1048
01:21:20.351 --> 01:21:21.886
We have to go ma'am.

1049
01:21:22.686 --> 01:21:24.788
I'll be right back!

1050
01:21:24.789 --> 01:21:26.557
Rita!

1051
01:21:28.357 --> 01:21:31.466
Rick, we need to go...

1052
01:21:35.266 --> 01:21:36.366
It's not that bad.

1053
01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:42.805
We need to go. They're
getting us out of here.


1054
01:21:42.806 --> 01:21:45.474
Come on, you two,
we need to go now!


1055
01:21:45.475 --> 01:21:46.744
We're taking him with us!

1056
01:21:48.544 --> 01:21:49.950
We're taking him with us!

1057
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:59.255
You don't have to.
You don't have to. It's OK.


1058
01:21:59.256 --> 01:22:00.356
It's OK.

1059
01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.380
Go.

1060
01:22:25.882 --> 01:22:27.585
You've got a plane to catch.

1061
01:22:28.385 --> 01:22:30.587
I'm sorry.

1062
01:22:30.588 --> 01:22:32.122
- I'm sorry
- It's OK.


1063
01:22:32.123 --> 01:22:37.395
I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry.

1064
01:22:39.195 --> 01:22:41.896
We've loaded the plane with

1065
01:22:41.897 --> 01:22:44.900
You have to hit the
center of the volcano.


1066
01:22:44.901 --> 01:22:45.967
OK.

1067
01:22:45.968 --> 01:22:47.338
Good Luck.

1068
01:22:55.212 --> 01:22:56.979
I'm a pilot.

1069
01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.080
I can fly.

1070
01:23:00.749 --> 01:23:01.949
It's time to go! Come on!

1071
01:23:02.552 --> 01:23:03.721
It's time to go!

1072
01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:07.658
Where's Rick?

1073
01:23:08.458 --> 01:23:09.860
Get him out of here! Ready?

1074
01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:12.398
Yeah yeah yeah.

1075
01:23:15.198 --> 01:23:16.609
The plane is cleared.

1076
01:23:25.409 --> 01:23:27.347
I'm not going anywhere.

1077
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.286
Good Luck son.

1078
01:23:37.287 --> 01:23:38.828
Red Wings, pull out.

1079
01:23:44.628 --> 01:23:48.670
Control, I've got an incoming
bogey. He's not gonna make it.


1080
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:55.542
I'm going in.

1081
01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:14.702
Come on!

1082
01:24:25.502 --> 01:24:30.943
Come on!!!

1083
01:24:51.128 --> 01:24:53.331
He did it!

1084
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:55.065
He did it!

1085
01:24:55.066 --> 01:24:56.233
Yes!

1086
01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:01.806
- Blow it up!
- No blow it up.


1087
01:25:01.832 --> 01:25:03.355
That's enough explosions for today.

1088
01:25:03.539 --> 01:25:05.610
I'm sorry I'm excited.

1089
01:25:10.513 --> 01:25:12.618
Sergeant congratulations!

1090
01:25:15.418 --> 01:25:17.653
Yeah. We did it!

1091
01:25:17.654 --> 01:25:19.057
We did it.

1092
01:25:20.857 --> 01:25:23.191
Hawaii wasn't alone
experiencing volcanic activity.


1093
01:25:23.192 --> 01:25:25.786
Mt. Vesuvius has reportedly erupted
wiping out Pompeii for good.


1094
01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:26.697
Tully.

1095
01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:29.399
Hell of a job soldier.

1096
01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.300
Hell of a job.

1097
01:25:31.301 --> 01:25:33.538
Colonel Rhyker would be proud.

1098
01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:36.405
Thank you sir.

1099
01:25:36.406 --> 01:25:37.506
No.

1100
01:25:38.141 --> 01:25:41.483
Thank you... Sergeant.

1101
01:25:46.283 --> 01:25:47.383
Carry on sergeant.

1102
01:25:47.551 --> 01:25:49.456
Yes, sir.

1103
01:26:23.019 --> 01:26:24.926
I'll never forget him.

1104
01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:31.710
Neither will I.
