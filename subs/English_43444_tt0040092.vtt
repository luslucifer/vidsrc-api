The digital restoration
of <i>L 'amore</i> was based


2
00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:18.509
on the original image
and soundtrack negatives


3
00:00:18.592 --> 00:00:21.717
and a vintage fine-grain print
preserved at CSC - Cineteca Nazionale.


4
00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:24.967
The restoration work was carried out
by Cineteca di Bologna


5
00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:28.217
and CSC - Cineteca Nazionale at
L'lmmagine Ritrovata laboratory in 2013.

THE FIRST STORY
"THE HUMAN VOICE"


7
00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:32.342
Quiet, Mincia.

8
00:03:36.301 --> 00:03:37.717
Here you go.

9
00:05:41.676 --> 00:05:43.426
No, Mincia, no.

10
00:06:09.842 --> 00:06:12.217
Hello?
Hello? Is that you?


11
00:06:13.092 --> 00:06:14.717
Hello?
Is that you?


12
00:06:14.842 --> 00:06:18.176
I can't hear anything.
I can't hear anything. Hello?


13
00:06:19.051 --> 00:06:21.259
Hello?
You sound very far away.


14
00:06:21.717 --> 00:06:24.092
I can hardly hear you.
Hello?


15
00:06:26.342 --> 00:06:27.551
Hello?
Go on.


16
00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.092
Yes.
What's that?


17
00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:32.634
No.
No, it wasn't me.


18
00:06:34.592 --> 00:06:37.926
Yes.
I've just got back.


19
00:06:38.717 --> 00:06:40.384
Why?
Did you call?


20
00:06:44.134 --> 00:06:46.217
No, I was out with Marta.

21
00:06:47.634 --> 00:06:51.467
It must be...
It's half past eleven.


22
00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:55.967
Aren't you at home?

23
00:06:56.676 --> 00:06:59.717
Well, look at the clock
on your mantelpiece.


24
00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.967
Ten o'clock?

25
00:07:03.301 --> 00:07:06.092
Ten o'clock...
My clock must be fast.


26
00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.092
That's strange.

27
00:07:08.842 --> 00:07:14.176
Last night...
I went to bed very early.


28
00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:17.301
I couldn't sleep so I took a pill.

29
00:07:17.884 --> 00:07:19.967
No, just one, at nine.

30
00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:23.426
I had a nasty headache, so...

31
00:07:24.384 --> 00:07:26.551
I'd been out with Marta all day.

32
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:32.134
Then I packed your bags.

33
00:07:36.134 --> 00:07:37.717
I'm very strong.

34
00:07:40.467 --> 00:07:42.551
I'm very brave.

35
00:07:44.967 --> 00:07:47.551
Today?
Marta came and picked me up.


36
00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:51.759
Yes, I've just got back from hers.

37
00:07:51.884 --> 00:07:53.551
She's been very sweet.

38
00:07:54.926 --> 00:07:57.092
Really kind.
Just what I needed.


39
00:07:58.342 --> 00:08:00.926
Yes, I did think that.

40
00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:03.926
But she's not selfish.
You were right as usual.


41
00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:05.801
What?

42
00:08:08.926 --> 00:08:11.259
My black satin dress.

43
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:14.759
Yes, I've still got it on.

44
00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:19.676
No, I haven't been smoking.
Just three cigarettes.


45
00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:22.342
That's all, I promise.

46
00:08:23.634 --> 00:08:25.717
You're very sweet.

47
00:08:26.634 --> 00:08:27.926
Sure.

48
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.426
Haven't you been out?

49
00:08:32.884 --> 00:08:35.301
You stayed at home all day?

50
00:08:35.426 --> 00:08:36.801
What business?

51
00:08:37.926 --> 00:08:39.467
Oh, right.

52
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:42.092
Hel...
Hello?


53
00:08:42.717 --> 00:08:44.926
Hello...
Hello?


54
00:08:45.842 --> 00:08:47.926
Hello? I can't hear anything.
Hello?


55
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:50.467
Hello?
Can you hear me?


56
00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:52.759
Hello?
I'm here.


57
00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:56.509
Yes, I'm here.

58
00:08:57.592 --> 00:08:59.759
Yes, I've packed the bags.
I told you.


59
00:09:01.926 --> 00:09:04.967
I put in your letters, and mine too.
Everything.


60
00:09:05.967 --> 00:09:08.551
You can get them picked up
whenever you want.


61
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:13.467
It's very upsetting.
I understand.


62
00:09:16.134 --> 00:09:18.634
Don't apologise, darling.
I'm the one who...


63
00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:20.467
I'm the one who's not...

64
00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:23.134
who's not loved.

65
00:09:25.634 --> 00:09:27.342
Oh, my love...

66
00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:31.551
No, I didn't think
I'd be this strong either.


67
00:09:32.134 --> 00:09:34.217
Don't admire me too much.

68
00:09:34.676 --> 00:09:36.967
I don't even know what I'm doing.

69
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:41.551
I get dressed, I go out, I come home.
I'm like a robot.


70
00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:46.092
I may not be so strong tomorrow.
I'm pretty sure I won't.


71
00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:48.259
You, a monster?

72
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:52.467
No.
No, darling, no.


73
00:09:53.842 --> 00:09:56.842
No, I'm not blaming you for anything.

74
00:09:58.967 --> 00:10:01.134
Yes, of course.

75
00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:03.342
It's only natural.

76
00:10:03.467 --> 00:10:05.967
No, my sweetheart.
What am I supposed to say?


77
00:10:06.634 --> 00:10:11.467
We always agreed we'd be honest with
each other, didn't we?


78
00:10:11.967 --> 00:10:16.467
It would have been terrible if you'd
kept it all from me until the last minute.


79
00:10:17.134 --> 00:10:19.467
The shock would have been unbearable.

80
00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:21.217
But this way, you know,

81
00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:26.217
I've had time to get used to it
and understand your reasons.


82
00:10:27.134 --> 00:10:28.759
What do you mean, acting?

83
00:10:30.092 --> 00:10:32.926
Why, do you want me
to put on an act?


84
00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.092
Nothing at all.

85
00:10:37.592 --> 00:10:39.551
I'm really calm.

86
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:43.676
I mean it.
You'd understand that.


87
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:46.134
I said you'd understand that.

88
00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:49.634
Do you think
I sound like I'm hiding something?


89
00:10:50.092 --> 00:10:54.217
No. I've decided to be brave
and I will be.


90
00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:58.092
What?

91
00:10:59.342 --> 00:11:01.551
But that was the other day.

92
00:11:02.176 --> 00:11:06.842
It's good to be strong
and prepared, you know.


93
00:11:07.717 --> 00:11:10.592
But when the time comes
it's always a big shock.


94
00:11:10.717 --> 00:11:12.592
No, that's going too far.

95
00:11:13.717 --> 00:11:17.717
As I said, I've had time
to get used to everything.


96
00:11:17.842 --> 00:11:21.301
And you've always
had this ability


97
00:11:21.426 --> 00:11:24.217
to calm me down
and make me feel looked after.


98
00:11:24.342 --> 00:11:25.926
It's frightening.

99
00:11:28.551 --> 00:11:31.176
There were too many obstacles
in our way.


100
00:11:31.676 --> 00:11:34.842
We either had to sacrifice
five years of happiness


101
00:11:34.967 --> 00:11:36.676
or accept the risks.

102
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:38.801
I took the risk.

103
00:11:38.926 --> 00:11:42.384
And today I'm paying dearly
for all the happiness I've had.


104
00:11:46.467 --> 00:11:48.176
Yes.
Hello?


105
00:11:48.967 --> 00:11:50.592
Hello?
Yes.


106
00:11:51.426 --> 00:11:53.884
I'm paying for it
but I don't regret anything.


107
00:11:54.051 --> 00:11:55.884
Not a single thing.

108
00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:59.092
You?
No, darling...


109
00:12:00.717 --> 00:12:03.551
You're wrong.
You're wrong, my love.


110
00:12:04.467 --> 00:12:08.134
I've got what I deserved
because I wanted too much happiness.


111
00:12:08.717 --> 00:12:10.801
It was like an obsession.

112
00:12:11.842 --> 00:12:13.509
My love...

113
00:12:15.384 --> 00:12:17.551
Don't apologise.
Don't apologise.


114
00:12:18.426 --> 00:12:20.759
It's all my fault, anyway.

115
00:12:20.884 --> 00:12:25.509
Don't you remember
that Sunday in Versailles?


116
00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:30.717
I wanted to come.
I wouldn't let you speak.


117
00:12:30.842 --> 00:12:34.509
I told you I was prepared
to accept everything.


118
00:12:34.592 --> 00:12:36.301
No, let me finish.

119
00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:40.592
I was the one who called you. I came
looking for you. Don't you remember?


120
00:12:41.592 --> 00:12:43.717
No, sweetheart, it was a Tuesday.

121
00:12:43.842 --> 00:12:45.717
Yes, Tuesday 27th.

122
00:12:45.842 --> 00:12:50.092
Your telegram had arrived on Monday

123
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:53.676
Those dates are fixed in my mind.

124
00:12:55.092 --> 00:12:56.426
What?

125
00:12:56.551 --> 00:12:58.967
I don't know
but I think I'll stay here.


126
00:13:01.717 --> 00:13:03.259
Tomorrow?

127
00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:05.801
You're leaving tomorrow?

128
00:13:06.592 --> 00:13:08.884
I didn't realise it was so soon.

129
00:13:09.051 --> 00:13:10.551
Well...

130
00:13:11.551 --> 00:13:13.467
Hold on a minute, sorry.

131
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:18.467
Tomorrow morning I'll leave the bags
downstairs with the porter.


132
00:13:19.384 --> 00:13:21.467
Send Giuseppe to pick them up.

133
00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:25.217
Oh, I...
No, it doesn't matter.


134
00:13:25.884 --> 00:13:29.717
I'll stay here or maybe go and spend
a few days in the country with Marta.


135
00:13:30.717 --> 00:13:31.967
Mincia?

136
00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:35.342
Mincia's like a lost soul.

137
00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:38.384
She looks at me,
pricks up her ears and listens.


138
00:13:38.842 --> 00:13:40.759
She's waiting for you.

139
00:13:41.926 --> 00:13:46.176
It feels like she's blaming me, as if
it's my fault you've stopped coming here.


140
00:13:48.592 --> 00:13:51.592
I think it would be best
if you took her back, darling.


141
00:13:52.384 --> 00:13:54.467
She'd be unhappy here.

142
00:13:55.259 --> 00:13:57.926
No, don't worry.

143
00:13:58.967 --> 00:14:02.842
She's not a woman's dog.
I wouldn't know how to deal with her.


144
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.842
She'd never go out
if she was with me.


145
00:14:04.967 --> 00:14:07.092
It's best if she stays with you.

146
00:14:07.884 --> 00:14:10.592
She'll soon forget about me,
don't worry.


147
00:14:12.884 --> 00:14:14.967
All right, darling, we'll sort it out.

148
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:18.384
Look, it's not that complicated.
Please.


149
00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:22.717
Don't worry about that,
you can always say she's a friend's dog.


150
00:14:23.676 --> 00:14:26.801
Mincia's very fond of Giuseppe.
Get him to pick her up.


151
00:14:28.926 --> 00:14:30.217
Look, please...

152
00:14:32.717 --> 00:14:34.801
All right, darling.
All right.


153
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:36.676
Your gloves?

154
00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:39.884
Oh, those gloves...
Those gloves.


155
00:14:41.217 --> 00:14:43.509
I don't know.
I don't think I've seen them.


156
00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:47.551
I don't know if I put them in the
suitcase. But don't worry about it.


157
00:14:47.634 --> 00:14:51.634
I'll look for them and if I find them
I'll give them to the porter. Don't worry.


158
00:14:53.217 --> 00:14:54.509
What is it, my love?

159
00:14:55.676 --> 00:14:56.884
The letters?

160
00:14:58.801 --> 00:15:00.051
My ones?

161
00:15:00.176 --> 00:15:01.842
Burn them.

162
00:15:03.217 --> 00:15:07.134
Listen, darling,
I want to ask you something.


163
00:15:08.217 --> 00:15:10.301
This may sound really silly.

164
00:15:12.176 --> 00:15:16.926
Look, I just wanted to say
that if you burn them


165
00:15:17.592 --> 00:15:19.259
I'd like you...

166
00:15:20.592 --> 00:15:22.967
I'd like you to keep the ashes

167
00:15:23.134 --> 00:15:25.467
in that tortoiseshell case.

168
00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:29.801
You know, the one I gave you
to put your cigarettes in


169
00:15:29.926 --> 00:15:31.217
and...

170
00:15:36.301 --> 00:15:38.176
No, no...

171
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:40.967
I'm so stupid, I'm sorry.

172
00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:45.509
Please forgive me, my love.

173
00:15:48.384 --> 00:15:50.259
See?

174
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:55.926
I was being so strong and then...

175
00:15:57.467 --> 00:15:58.717
Hello?

176
00:15:58.842 --> 00:16:02.259
Hello? What is it?
Why aren't you saying anything?


177
00:16:02.842 --> 00:16:05.134
Yes, I've calmed down.

178
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:08.509
I've calmed down now.
I'm not crying any more.


179
00:16:10.092 --> 00:16:14.217
I was saying that I'd like you
to keep those ashes. All right?


180
00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:17.134
Thank you, my love.

181
00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:21.759
No, it's not too late for me.
It doesn't matter.


182
00:16:22.592 --> 00:16:25.676
Oh, of course.
You've got to work.


183
00:16:25.801 --> 00:16:29.592
You'd better go to bed now
if you've got to get up early tomorrow.


184
00:16:30.426 --> 00:16:31.801
Tomorrow...

185
00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:33.634
Hello?

186
00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:36.884
Yes, I can hear
a lot of interference too.


187
00:16:37.842 --> 00:16:39.509
But your voice is clear.

188
00:16:39.634 --> 00:16:42.426
It's as if you were here
in the bedroom with me.


189
00:16:43.717 --> 00:16:44.759
Hello?
What...


190
00:16:44.884 --> 00:16:47.884
What's that?
I can't hear you. What did you say?


191
00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:53.967
That's strange.
Your telephone's making strange noises.


192
00:16:54.676 --> 00:16:58.176
It doesn't sound like you're calling
from your own telephone.


193
00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:00.551
Oh, of course.

194
00:17:00.634 --> 00:17:02.092
My love...

195
00:17:02.884 --> 00:17:05.884
My love, I can see you.

196
00:17:08.342 --> 00:17:11.259
You're wearing your scarf,
the red one,


197
00:17:12.592 --> 00:17:15.842
and your sleeves are rolled up
to your elbows.


198
00:17:17.176 --> 00:17:19.301
You've got the receiver
in your left hand


199
00:17:19.426 --> 00:17:23.134
and a pencil in your right
and you're drawing on the blotting paper.


200
00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:25.884
Hearts, stars...

201
00:17:27.717 --> 00:17:28.967
You're laughing?

202
00:17:29.676 --> 00:17:31.842
I've got eyes instead of ears.

203
00:17:33.176 --> 00:17:37.259
No, don't look at me, please.
If you only knew...


204
00:17:37.967 --> 00:17:42.592
I'm not telling you what I did
when I looked at myself in the mirror.


205
00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:46.551
Oh, my God.
My God.


206
00:17:47.134 --> 00:17:51.384
Oh, my darling, my love,
you're so sweet


207
00:17:51.551 --> 00:17:54.592
but you really can't say
that I've got a pretty face.


208
00:17:56.092 --> 00:17:58.551
You know, I actually preferred it

209
00:17:58.717 --> 00:18:01.842
when you used to call me ugly.

210
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:04.092
My ugly one...

211
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:06.676
My ugly mug...

212
00:18:08.634 --> 00:18:10.551
Hello?
Hello?


213
00:18:11.342 --> 00:18:12.384
Hello?

214
00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.176
Hello?

215
00:18:14.801 --> 00:18:16.092
Hello?

216
00:18:16.217 --> 00:18:17.509
Hello?

217
00:18:18.342 --> 00:18:19.592
Hello?

218
00:18:20.384 --> 00:18:22.092
Hello?

219
00:18:23.051 --> 00:18:24.092
Hello?

220
00:18:31.676 --> 00:18:32.717
Hello?

221
00:18:33.426 --> 00:18:34.467
Hello?

222
00:18:34.842 --> 00:18:35.884
Hel...

223
00:18:36.967 --> 00:18:38.509
Hello?
Giuseppe?


224
00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:41.384
I got cut off
when I was speaking to Mr...


225
00:18:43.759 --> 00:18:45.217
He's not at home?

226
00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:47.926
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

227
00:18:48.092 --> 00:18:52.551
I knew he wasn't going home tonight.
He must have called from the restaurant.


228
00:18:52.676 --> 00:18:53.967
I'm so stupid.

229
00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.926
Thank you so much, Giuseppe.
Sorry. Good night.


230
00:21:54.176 --> 00:21:55.217
Hello?

231
00:21:55.342 --> 00:21:57.176
Hello?
Is that you, darling?


232
00:21:58.801 --> 00:22:00.092
We got cut off.

233
00:22:01.176 --> 00:22:02.634
No, I was waiting.

234
00:22:04.176 --> 00:22:05.842
Of course, I understand.

235
00:22:08.634 --> 00:22:10.342
Are you sleepy?

236
00:22:11.509 --> 00:22:13.092
You're very sweet.

237
00:22:13.676 --> 00:22:16.759
It was very kind of you
to call me back.


238
00:22:21.634 --> 00:22:23.342
Yes, I'm still here.
Go on.


239
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:24.842
Nothing.

240
00:22:26.884 --> 00:22:28.592
Nothing, don't worry.

241
00:22:30.217 --> 00:22:32.551
No, you're wrong, 
I'm not upset.

242
00:22:33.384 --> 00:22:36.342
No, no.
What do you mean, my voice?


243
00:22:36.467 --> 00:22:38.426
It's the same as it was earlier.

244
00:22:38.551 --> 00:22:41.217
No, it's just that I keep on talking

245
00:22:41.342 --> 00:22:43.801
and forget that it's all got to end

246
00:22:44.551 --> 00:22:47.176
and I'll be thrown back
into darkness and silence.


247
00:22:47.759 --> 00:22:50.801
Listen, darling,
I've never lied to you, have I?


248
00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:55.634
Yes, I know,
but I lied to you just now.


249
00:22:55.759 --> 00:22:58.384
I lied to you earlier on the telephone.

250
00:22:58.509 --> 00:23:00.551
Everything I told you was a lie.

251
00:23:00.676 --> 00:23:03.759
I know I've got no hope
and it's pointless,


252
00:23:03.926 --> 00:23:05.426
but lying brings bad luck

253
00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:07.551
and I don't like doing it,

254
00:23:07.676 --> 00:23:09.592
even if it's for your sake.

255
00:23:10.967 --> 00:23:13.467
No, don't worry,
it's nothing serious.


256
00:23:14.217 --> 00:23:17.926
I lied to you
when I told you what I was wearing


257
00:23:18.551 --> 00:23:20.634
and that I'd had dinner with Marta.

258
00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:22.426
I didn't have dinner with her.

259
00:23:23.176 --> 00:23:25.384
I'm not wearing my black satin dress.

260
00:23:25.509 --> 00:23:28.092
I'm here in the bed, freezing cold.

261
00:23:28.217 --> 00:23:31.092
All this waiting has frozen me,
you see.


262
00:23:31.217 --> 00:23:34.301
All this getting up,
sitting down, going to bed,


263
00:23:34.426 --> 00:23:37.217
pacing up and down
like a caged animal,


264
00:23:37.384 --> 00:23:40.301
staring at a telephone
that never rang.


265
00:23:40.467 --> 00:23:44.426
All this waiting, waiting, waiting.

266
00:23:45.134 --> 00:23:47.217
I don't even know what for.

267
00:23:47.967 --> 00:23:49.217
Yes, go on.

268
00:23:50.217 --> 00:23:51.842
Go on, tell me.
I'll be calm.


269
00:23:53.134 --> 00:23:55.259
I'll answer all your questions.
Go on.


270
00:23:56.176 --> 00:23:58.259
I'll tell you the truth, I promise.

271
00:24:00.842 --> 00:24:02.134
Here.

272
00:24:03.092 --> 00:24:05.092
No, I haven't eaten anything.

273
00:24:05.217 --> 00:24:07.634
I couldn't.
I've been in a very bad way.


274
00:24:08.426 --> 00:24:12.051
Last night or maybe the night before,
I can't remember when,


275
00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:15.051
I wanted to take a pill
to make me sleep.


276
00:24:16.051 --> 00:24:20.509
And then I thought that if I took more
I'd sleep better.


277
00:24:21.551 --> 00:24:26.134
And if I took them all
I'd sleep without any dreams


278
00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:27.884
and would never wake up.

279
00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:31.092
I'd be dead.

280
00:24:31.842 --> 00:24:33.092
I took 12.

281
00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:36.884
But I did have a dream.
I dreamt about the two of us.


282
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:39.467
But when I realised that I was alone

283
00:24:39.551 --> 00:24:43.134
and my head wasn't on your shoulder
and my legs weren't next to yours,


284
00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:46.509
I felt that I couldn't go on living.

285
00:24:47.676 --> 00:24:50.509
I was completely frozen,
my heart had stopped beating


286
00:24:50.592 --> 00:24:52.967
but death just wouldn't come.

287
00:24:53.676 --> 00:24:56.926
I was so distressed.
After about an hour I called Marta.


288
00:24:57.092 --> 00:25:01.092
I didn't have the courage
to die alone, my love.


289
00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:06.967
It was four in the morning. Marta came
with the doctor who lives in her building.


290
00:25:07.134 --> 00:25:08.592
My temperature was over40.

291
00:25:08.717 --> 00:25:12.592
They say poisoning yourself is hard
because most people mistake the dose.


292
00:25:13.217 --> 00:25:15.384
No, Marta stayed with me till this
evening.


293
00:25:15.509 --> 00:25:20.634
I made her leave because you'd
promised to call me one last time.


294
00:25:20.759 --> 00:25:23.259
I was afraid
that she wouldn't let me talk to you.


295
00:25:23.384 --> 00:25:27.134
I'd promised myself
that I wouldn't bother you,


296
00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:30.634
I'd let you go without making a scene
and say goodbye


297
00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:33.759
as if we were going
to see each other the next day, but...


298
00:25:34.676 --> 00:25:35.926
Darling, talk to me.

299
00:25:36.134 --> 00:25:39.176
Talk about whatever you like,
so long as you talk to me.


300
00:25:40.134 --> 00:25:41.592
I've suffered so much,

301
00:25:41.676 --> 00:25:45.676
but just the sound of your voice
makes me feel better.


302
00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:47.509
I close my eyes...

303
00:25:47.592 --> 00:25:52.134
Sometimes when I had my head on your
shoulder and my ear on your chest


304
00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:53.509
and you spoke to me,

305
00:25:53.592 --> 00:25:57.467
I'd hear your voice just like
I hear it tonight over the telephone.


306
00:25:58.842 --> 00:26:03.051
No, my love, I was so happy.

307
00:26:03.717 --> 00:26:07.217
I saw her photo
in a magazine at the milliner's studio.


308
00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:12.217
I didn't tell you because I didn't want
to spoil our last weeks together.


309
00:26:13.384 --> 00:26:15.051
Hello?
I can hear music.


310
00:26:15.551 --> 00:26:17.592
I said I can hear music.

311
00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:19.051
Oh, the neighbours.

312
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:25.051
You should bang on the wall and get
them to turn their gramophone down.


313
00:26:26.217 --> 00:26:27.801
They've got into bad habits

314
00:26:27.926 --> 00:26:31.134
because they know
that you never used to sleep at home.


315
00:26:32.801 --> 00:26:33.842
No, darling, no.

316
00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:37.092
Please don't. If you didn't call back
I'd go out of my mind.


317
00:26:37.967 --> 00:26:40.592
Sorry, darling.
Sorry, darling.


318
00:26:40.717 --> 00:26:44.426
I know this scene I'm making is
unbearable, but try to understand.


319
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:46.967
Try to understand, my love.
I'm suffering.


320
00:26:47.134 --> 00:26:49.551
I'm suffering for love.
I'm suffering.


321
00:26:49.676 --> 00:26:53.967
And this telephone line is
the only thing that still ties me to you.


322
00:26:56.384 --> 00:27:01.884
The other night, or maybe last night,
I slept with the telephone in the bed.


323
00:27:02.926 --> 00:27:07.301
Yes, I know I'm ridiculous,
but it's the only bond between us now.


324
00:27:07.426 --> 00:27:10.551
I fell asleep waiting for you to call.

325
00:27:11.384 --> 00:27:14.884
You don't know how many dreams I've
had, how many nightmares,


326
00:27:15.092 --> 00:27:18.259
but they were all so vivid.

327
00:27:18.384 --> 00:27:19.967
It's terrible.

328
00:27:20.134 --> 00:27:24.259
For five years I lived for you.
You were the only air I breathed.


329
00:27:24.801 --> 00:27:26.884
I spent my life waiting for you,

330
00:27:27.051 --> 00:27:29.134
thinking you were dead
if you were late,


331
00:27:29.259 --> 00:27:32.134
dying and then coming back to life
when you appeared,


332
00:27:32.217 --> 00:27:34.509
dying of fear whenever you left.

333
00:27:34.592 --> 00:27:37.717
I'm only breathing now
because you're talking to me.


334
00:27:37.884 --> 00:27:41.134
If you hang up now,
I'll die just like that.


335
00:27:42.801 --> 00:27:45.634
Yes, darling, I'll try,
but even if I do fall asleep


336
00:27:45.759 --> 00:27:48.634
there are the dreams,
and then there's waking up again,


337
00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:52.926
and then having to get up,
eat, wash and go out, but go where?


338
00:27:53.051 --> 00:27:54.926
Where?
Where should I go?


339
00:27:55.926 --> 00:27:59.884
My love, I didn't have anything else
to do except be with you.


340
00:28:00.051 --> 00:28:01.759
Only you.

341
00:28:02.467 --> 00:28:04.384
Something to distract me?

342
00:28:05.342 --> 00:28:07.551
After that fateful Sunday evening,

343
00:28:07.634 --> 00:28:11.926
the only time I've had something
to distract me and haven't thought of you


344
00:28:12.092 --> 00:28:15.842
was at the dentist's,
when he touched one of my nerves,


345
00:28:16.384 --> 00:28:18.259
but it was only for a brief moment.

346
00:28:25.842 --> 00:28:26.884
Mincia...

347
00:28:29.801 --> 00:28:31.676
My Mincia...

348
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:34.551
Yes.

349
00:28:36.634 --> 00:28:38.092
Yes.

350
00:28:40.426 --> 00:28:41.842
Mincia...

351
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:46.301
Mincia hasn't left her corner for two
days. She won't eat, she won't...


352
00:28:46.426 --> 00:28:48.759
I've tried to call her and stroke her.

353
00:28:48.884 --> 00:28:52.217
She doesn't want to be touched.
I'm pretty sure she'd bite me.


354
00:28:52.342 --> 00:28:54.467
Yes, me.

355
00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:58.342
Believe me, she's a different dog.
She frightens me.


356
00:28:59.217 --> 00:29:03.384
I don't know,
maybe she thinks I've hurt you.


357
00:29:03.884 --> 00:29:07.967
There's no point in that dog staying here
and becoming sick and bad-tempered.


358
00:29:09.426 --> 00:29:12.092
She won't bite anybody at your house.

359
00:29:12.176 --> 00:29:14.884
She'll love the people you love,
I'm sure.


360
00:29:15.051 --> 00:29:18.842
No, I meant she'll grow fond
of the people you live with.


361
00:29:23.592 --> 00:29:28.051
Listen, a few days ago I met that person
whose name begins with S.


362
00:29:28.717 --> 00:29:30.592
Yes, BS, that's right.

363
00:29:31.134 --> 00:29:33.551
She asked me if you had a brother

364
00:29:33.634 --> 00:29:36.551
and if he was the one
whose wedding has been announced.


365
00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:40.467
It felt like
she was commiserating with me.


366
00:29:41.676 --> 00:29:45.217
Yes, whatever.
I couldn't care less.


367
00:29:45.342 --> 00:29:46.717
They can say what they want.

368
00:29:46.842 --> 00:29:50.842
To be honest,
people can't understand our relationship.


369
00:29:51.426 --> 00:29:54.467
Look, most people either love each
other or hate each other.


370
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:58.717
If something's over, it's over. There are
some things you could never explain.


371
00:30:00.551 --> 00:30:03.717
But it's best to do what I do
and not give a damn.


372
00:30:05.176 --> 00:30:06.926
I'm so stupid.

373
00:30:07.092 --> 00:30:09.051
I'm such an idiot.

374
00:30:09.176 --> 00:30:13.551
I keep on talking, I think
I'm talking to you like I've always done,


375
00:30:13.634 --> 00:30:16.592
but all of a sudden
the truth dawns on me.


376
00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:24.384
Don't worry,
you can't kill yourself twice.


377
00:30:25.842 --> 00:30:28.467
No, I won't take it.
Well, maybe just so I can sleep.


378
00:30:28.551 --> 00:30:32.342
No, I haven't got one.
I'd never be able to buy a gun.


379
00:30:32.426 --> 00:30:35.051
Can you really see me buying a gun?

380
00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:38.967
I can't even tell a lie.

381
00:30:40.134 --> 00:30:44.259
Sometimes lying is necessary or helpful.

382
00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:48.884
If you lied to make our separation...

383
00:30:50.717 --> 00:30:52.884
No, darling,
I'm not saying you're lying.


384
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:54.467
I'm saying if you lied...

385
00:30:55.676 --> 00:30:57.551
If I knew that...

386
00:30:57.634 --> 00:31:00.467
If you told me you were at home
when you weren't...


387
00:31:02.967 --> 00:31:05.467
No, darling,
just listen to me for a minute.


388
00:31:05.967 --> 00:31:08.384
I didn't mean to
say I don't believe you.

389
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:11.051
Why are you getting all angry now?

390
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:15.676
Your voice sounds cruel now.
Why?


391
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:18.551
It was just an example.
Listen to me.


392
00:31:18.717 --> 00:31:24.801
I was just saying that
if you lied to me out of kindness


393
00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:26.467
and I realised,

394
00:31:27.092 --> 00:31:29.634
my feelings for you wouldn't change.

395
00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:31.509
Do you understand?

396
00:31:32.384 --> 00:31:35.051
No...
Can't you talk from there?


397
00:31:35.926 --> 00:31:37.426
Will you call me back?

398
00:31:39.301 --> 00:31:40.967
You're near here?

399
00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:45.676
You're here...
When you will call me back?


400
00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:49.467
No. Listen.
Listen, my love.


401
00:31:49.551 --> 00:31:51.926
My love, I've hurt you so much.
Listen...


402
00:31:52.134 --> 00:31:53.926
Darling, listen.
Hello?


403
00:32:00.926 --> 00:32:01.967
Oh, God.

404
00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:06.426
Dear God, let him call back.

405
00:32:08.176 --> 00:32:09.801
Dear God, let him call back.

406
00:32:10.926 --> 00:32:12.759
Dear God, let him call back.

407
00:32:15.092 --> 00:32:16.676
Dear God, let him call back.

408
00:32:17.342 --> 00:32:19.217
Dear God, let him call back.

409
00:32:19.342 --> 00:32:22.467
Dear God, let him call back.
Dear God, let him call back.


410
00:32:23.051 --> 00:32:25.634
Dear God, let him call back.
Dear God...


411
00:32:43.384 --> 00:32:44.967
Dear God, let it be him.

412
00:32:46.676 --> 00:32:48.384
Dear God, let it be him.

413
00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:51.467
Dear God, let it be him.

414
00:32:56.176 --> 00:32:58.092
Dear God, let it be him.

415
00:33:08.551 --> 00:33:09.926
Dear God, let it be him.

416
00:33:10.634 --> 00:33:12.342
Dear God, let it be him.

417
00:33:17.842 --> 00:33:19.092
Oh, God.

418
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:26.967
Dear God, let it be him.

419
00:33:28.426 --> 00:33:30.134
Dear God, let it be him.

420
00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:15.592
Darling.
My love.


421
00:34:15.717 --> 00:34:18.384
My love.
My love...


422
00:34:18.467 --> 00:34:21.426
My love, my love, my love...

423
00:34:21.509 --> 00:34:24.176
My love.
My love...


424
00:34:24.301 --> 00:34:25.759
Yes, I know, it's frightening.

425
00:34:25.884 --> 00:34:29.842
I'll never have the courage, my love.
I'll never have the courage.


426
00:34:30.967 --> 00:34:34.842
Listen, darling, the day after tomorrow
you two will be in Marseilles.


427
00:34:34.967 --> 00:34:38.509
My love,
please promise me one thing,


428
00:34:38.592 --> 00:34:41.592
that you won't stay in the hotel
where we used to go.


429
00:34:42.342 --> 00:34:43.551
Thank you, darling.

430
00:34:43.676 --> 00:34:45.301
Thank you, my love.

431
00:34:45.426 --> 00:34:47.842
No, I don't want to see you again.

432
00:34:47.967 --> 00:34:50.384
We'll never see each other again.

433
00:34:50.509 --> 00:34:52.551
Forgive me, darling.
Forgive me.


434
00:34:54.176 --> 00:34:56.051
My darling love.

435
00:34:56.801 --> 00:34:58.676
Yes, I know, I'll be strong.

436
00:34:59.259 --> 00:35:01.217
Hang up now.

437
00:35:01.342 --> 00:35:03.884
Quickly.
Quickly. Quick...


438
00:35:04.842 --> 00:35:06.134
No!

439
00:35:06.259 --> 00:35:07.884
I love you, darling!

440
00:35:08.551 --> 00:35:10.301
I love you!

441
00:35:10.426 --> 00:35:11.467
I love you.

442
00:35:11.551 --> 00:35:12.759
I love you.

443
00:35:12.884 --> 00:35:15.842
I love you.
I love you...


444
00:35:20.551 --> 00:35:25.134
END OF THE FIRST STORY

445
00:36:12.592 --> 00:36:17.801
"THE MIRACLE"

446
00:36:57.509 --> 00:37:02.676
This film is a tribute
to the art of ANNA MAGNANI


447
00:38:06.509 --> 00:38:08.759
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

448
00:38:08.884 --> 00:38:11.301
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

449
00:38:12.217 --> 00:38:14.509
I knew you would come.

450
00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:16.259
My God, you're so handsome.

451
00:38:16.884 --> 00:38:19.842
Why are you going?
Don't go away.


452
00:38:19.967 --> 00:38:21.634
Can I speak to you?
Can I?


453
00:38:21.759 --> 00:38:23.717
My God, this is such a comfort.

454
00:38:23.842 --> 00:38:28.092
My beautiful saint.
So much happiness, so much joy!


455
00:38:28.217 --> 00:38:32.467
I knew you would come.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.


456
00:38:32.551 --> 00:38:34.467
My beautiful saint.

457
00:38:34.551 --> 00:38:36.467
I'd always hear your voice.

458
00:38:36.551 --> 00:38:38.551
If I closed my eyes I'd see you,

459
00:38:38.676 --> 00:38:42.051
surrounded by bright light
and smiling at me.


460
00:38:42.176 --> 00:38:46.467
My God, so much laughter,
so much comfort.


461
00:38:46.551 --> 00:38:49.926
My Saint Joseph,
my saint, my beautiful saint.


462
00:38:50.092 --> 00:38:53.801
I worship you, my saint. You're the most
handsome of all the saints.


463
00:38:54.592 --> 00:38:56.134
My Saint Joseph.

464
00:38:56.259 --> 00:38:59.217
Don't go away.
Don't go just like that.


465
00:38:59.842 --> 00:39:02.842
Now you've come
you mustn't leave just like that.


466
00:39:03.592 --> 00:39:07.259
You need to give me your grace.
You need to take me away with you.


467
00:39:07.384 --> 00:39:10.967
It's not hard for you.
You just let me die and it's all done.


468
00:39:11.509 --> 00:39:13.717
And you take me
up to heaven with you

469
00:39:13.842 --> 00:39:16.134
to contemplate the Lord.

470
00:39:23.051 --> 00:39:24.676
You're so beautiful.

471
00:39:24.801 --> 00:39:27.509
Such happiness, such joy.

472
00:39:27.592 --> 00:39:29.259
My Saint Joseph.

473
00:39:29.926 --> 00:39:32.759
You're the kindest saint I know.

474
00:39:33.342 --> 00:39:35.217
If you weren't,

475
00:39:35.342 --> 00:39:39.842
the Lord wouldn't have entrusted
the Madonna and her child to you.


476
00:39:40.967 --> 00:39:44.217
So give me your grace.
You've done it so many times for me.


477
00:39:44.342 --> 00:39:45.801
You've given me everything.

478
00:39:45.926 --> 00:39:47.592
Such kindness.

479
00:39:47.717 --> 00:39:51.634
You'd answer my prayers. If I asked
for something, you'd give it to.


480
00:39:51.717 --> 00:39:54.551
This is the dress
the nuns gave me.


481
00:39:54.634 --> 00:39:56.801
The one I asked you for,
remember?


482
00:39:56.884 --> 00:40:00.884
Now they even give me hot soup
and a place to sleep.


483
00:40:01.384 --> 00:40:04.759
I never ask for anything
from the other saints, but you...


484
00:40:04.884 --> 00:40:08.051
Don't laugh at me.
I know how it works.


485
00:40:08.592 --> 00:40:12.384
All of a sudden you disappear
and I'm left here by myself.


486
00:40:12.842 --> 00:40:15.676
My Saint Joseph,
my beautiful Saint Joseph,


487
00:40:15.801 --> 00:40:20.592
you need to take me up there with you,
to the other land.


488
00:40:21.342 --> 00:40:22.967
So much happiness!

489
00:40:23.134 --> 00:40:26.301
Nobody here will notice anyway
if I die.


490
00:40:26.426 --> 00:40:30.092
Even the goats know how
to get back to the village by themselves.


491
00:40:30.217 --> 00:40:34.551
Beautiful Saint Joseph.
My beautiful saint. Where's your lily?


492
00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:40.051
You're so handsome.
So beautiful.


493
00:40:40.717 --> 00:40:42.634
There's no point in me staying here.

494
00:40:42.717 --> 00:40:46.759
When I told them you'd spoken to me,
you wouldn't believe what they did.


495
00:40:46.884 --> 00:40:48.967
They drove me insane.

496
00:40:49.092 --> 00:40:51.092
They blew a trumpet in my ear
and said,


497
00:40:51.217 --> 00:40:53.967
"This is the trumpet
of the Archangel Gabriel."


498
00:40:54.134 --> 00:40:55.967
They were so mean.

499
00:40:56.134 --> 00:40:59.259
But they don't understand.
They're not worthy.


500
00:40:59.384 --> 00:41:03.217
You're here, though.
Saint Joseph is up here.


501
00:41:03.342 --> 00:41:06.092
He came here to me.
Just to me.


502
00:41:06.259 --> 00:41:08.801
You went through the village
and no one saw you.


503
00:41:08.926 --> 00:41:10.676
They're not worthy.

504
00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:12.676
They're not worthy, but I am.

505
00:41:13.217 --> 00:41:14.884
You're so beautiful.

506
00:41:15.467 --> 00:41:19.259
You know what they keep telling me?
"Mad people can't go to heaven."


507
00:41:19.842 --> 00:41:21.134
For me?

508
00:41:24.801 --> 00:41:27.509
But that's not true, is it?

509
00:41:28.134 --> 00:41:29.842
You know what temptation is?

510
00:41:29.967 --> 00:41:32.176
At one point I kept hearing this voice.

511
00:41:32.342 --> 00:41:35.759
A sweet voice,
just like your voice would sound,


512
00:41:35.842 --> 00:41:41.134
that said, "Throw yourself off, you idiot!
Throw yourself off!"


513
00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:45.467
I'd always get this far,
right here,


514
00:41:45.551 --> 00:41:47.384
but I wasn't brave enough.

515
00:41:47.509 --> 00:41:49.134
Then I'd regret it and say,

516
00:41:49.259 --> 00:41:51.967
"Tomorrow, when the bells ring,

517
00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:55.259
"if Saint Joseph asks again
I'll throw myself off."


518
00:41:55.384 --> 00:41:59.176
But then I understood.
I understood because it wasn't you.


519
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:01.551
You know who it was?
It was the devil.


520
00:42:02.384 --> 00:42:05.884
He wanted me to kill myself so I'd be
damned and wouldn't go to heaven.


521
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:08.134
But I was clever.

522
00:42:11.426 --> 00:42:15.384
You know what I'm going to do with you
now? I'm going to do something else.


523
00:42:15.467 --> 00:42:19.551
Look.
You stay still in the air up there.


524
00:42:19.926 --> 00:42:22.301
Up there.
And call me.


525
00:42:22.426 --> 00:42:23.634
I'll come towards you.

526
00:42:23.759 --> 00:42:27.842
And if I get scared and fall,
you'll take my hand and pull me up.


527
00:42:27.926 --> 00:42:31.217
Little by little I'll learn how to do it.
Of course I will.


528
00:42:31.342 --> 00:42:34.092
And then we'll go up there.
Look, up there.


529
00:42:34.217 --> 00:42:36.467
The sanctuary of Saint Michael
is up there.


530
00:42:36.551 --> 00:42:39.259
Why am I telling you?
You know everything.


531
00:42:39.759 --> 00:42:41.509
We'll climb up the bell tower.

532
00:42:41.551 --> 00:42:45.467
You can see all the mountains,
all the houses, the sea.


533
00:42:45.551 --> 00:42:48.967
You'll take me by the hand.
Saint Michael can help me too, can't he?


534
00:42:49.134 --> 00:42:54.092
The three of us will leave the tower
and soar over the Furore Valley.


535
00:42:54.217 --> 00:42:58.426
We'll glide over the sea, drop down to
touch the water with our toes


536
00:42:58.926 --> 00:43:00.384
and then fly back up.

537
00:43:01.301 --> 00:43:03.092
Up.

538
00:43:03.676 --> 00:43:06.551
My beautiful Saint Joseph,
let me die, let me...


539
00:43:10.384 --> 00:43:11.592
If Jesus...

540
00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:16.551
If...

541
00:43:23.759 --> 00:43:27.717
If Jesus came back to earth
I'd like to stay here,


542
00:43:28.551 --> 00:43:30.634
but he's not coming back.

543
00:43:30.759 --> 00:43:34.176
You're an important saint
but you're not Jesus.


544
00:43:34.301 --> 00:43:36.884
He cured the sick
and banished the devil,


545
00:43:37.634 --> 00:43:40.967
but the devil's everywhere
and everybody is sick.


546
00:43:42.301 --> 00:43:46.967
If he came back... Or if he made
the world come to an end...


547
00:43:48.551 --> 00:43:51.884
These are divine plans, aren't they?
I know.


548
00:44:01.051 --> 00:44:03.551
You can't do that, can you?
Can you?


549
00:44:04.301 --> 00:44:06.551
No?
It's easy.


550
00:44:07.717 --> 00:44:09.801
It's nice.
Listen.


551
00:44:16.217 --> 00:44:18.092
It's like heaven.

552
00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:20.676
Just like heaven.

553
00:44:21.884 --> 00:44:24.342
I'm covered in sweat.

554
00:44:25.134 --> 00:44:26.426
Right here.

555
00:44:27.217 --> 00:44:30.551
I'm covered in sweat.
My legs too.


556
00:44:33.551 --> 00:44:34.801
Thank you.

557
00:44:41.217 --> 00:44:43.301
I can hardly see you anymore.

558
00:44:43.967 --> 00:44:46.092
There's a glow around you.

559
00:44:46.217 --> 00:44:47.801
Can you see how you are?

560
00:44:47.926 --> 00:44:52.884
I know there's more and more light
and then you disappear.


561
00:44:53.051 --> 00:44:56.842
Why do you want to go?
I don't want to stay here.


562
00:44:59.801 --> 00:45:01.801
You know, when I was younger,

563
00:45:03.217 --> 00:45:06.509
Casimiro the village idiot
wanted to marry me.


564
00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:09.509
He was such a fool.

565
00:45:10.717 --> 00:45:14.051
If I had children
I wouldn't be able to come with you.


566
00:45:15.092 --> 00:45:17.426
Take me away,
don't leave me here.


567
00:45:18.301 --> 00:45:21.592
Don't leave me here.
It's like heaven.


568
00:45:22.301 --> 00:45:23.967
Just like heaven.

569
00:45:26.967 --> 00:45:29.301
Give me some drink.
I don't feel well.


570
00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:31.509
Give me some drink.
I don't feel well.


571
00:45:56.551 --> 00:45:58.259
My Saint Joseph.

572
00:45:59.426 --> 00:46:00.801
My Saint Joseph.

573
00:46:03.592 --> 00:46:05.676
He took the bread and broke it

574
00:46:06.676 --> 00:46:11.301
and an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream and said,


575
00:46:12.092 --> 00:46:17.467
"Joseph, son of David,
be not afraid to take Mary as your wife


576
00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:21.676
"because that which is conceived in
her..."


577
00:46:25.259 --> 00:46:26.842
My Saint Joseph.

578
00:46:27.759 --> 00:46:30.384
Throw away my body
and take my soul.


579
00:46:31.592 --> 00:46:34.176
Throw it away without any clothes on.

580
00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:37.634
Saint Joseph...

581
00:46:37.759 --> 00:46:40.259
Saint Joseph, please help me.

582
00:46:40.384 --> 00:46:42.259
It's like heaven.

583
00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:45.134
Heaven on earth.

584
00:46:46.051 --> 00:46:48.217
The madwoman has received your
grace.


585
00:46:48.884 --> 00:46:49.926
I...

586
00:46:50.759 --> 00:46:51.801
I feel ill.

587
00:46:53.717 --> 00:46:54.967
I'm sick.

588
00:48:22.509 --> 00:48:23.967
Come on, let's go.

589
00:48:24.842 --> 00:48:26.134
Let's go.

590
00:50:00.134 --> 00:50:02.051
Brother Raffaele!

591
00:50:10.509 --> 00:50:12.676
- Good day, Brother Raffaele.
- Good day.


592
00:50:12.801 --> 00:50:15.717
Tell me, saints can appear to us,
can't they?


593
00:50:15.842 --> 00:50:17.717
- Yes, I always see them.
- Where?


594
00:50:17.842 --> 00:50:21.092
I always see the Madonna..
She appears whenever she wishes.


595
00:50:21.217 --> 00:50:24.509
- Can we see them with our eyes?
- Of course.


596
00:50:25.634 --> 00:50:27.842
- Who have you seen?
- The Madonna.


597
00:50:27.967 --> 00:50:31.176
- Do you see her all the time?
- All day long.


598
00:50:31.301 --> 00:50:34.134
- Jesus! Is she pretty?
- She's beautiful.


599
00:50:36.634 --> 00:50:41.551
You know what? I've seen Saint Joseph.
Just now, on Capo d'Orso.


600
00:50:41.967 --> 00:50:44.551
And I spoke to him.
A lot.


601
00:50:44.634 --> 00:50:47.801
He was so handsome, Brother Raffaele.
I want to see him again.


602
00:50:48.467 --> 00:50:50.384
Maybe he'll come back the same way.

603
00:50:50.509 --> 00:50:53.342
- You think so?
- When the Lord wishes...


604
00:50:53.467 --> 00:50:55.176
- What is it?
- How can I put it?


605
00:50:55.259 --> 00:50:58.176
- There's been a miracle.
- What do you mean, a miracle?


606
00:50:58.301 --> 00:50:59.884
You've never had visions?

607
00:51:00.092 --> 00:51:03.551
I've been here for 20 years
and I've never seen a miracle.


608
00:51:03.676 --> 00:51:06.884
- What do you say, Brother Raffaele?
- He's crazy.


609
00:51:07.051 --> 00:51:09.467
Haven't you ever had a vision?

610
00:52:26.217 --> 00:52:27.467
Take the apple.

611
00:52:30.759 --> 00:52:33.134
Take the apple.

612
00:52:33.217 --> 00:52:34.884
Give it to me.

613
00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:36.884
Give it to me.

614
00:52:44.134 --> 00:52:47.842
I want the apple.
Give it to me.


615
00:53:31.426 --> 00:53:33.842
Will you give it to me?

616
00:53:34.676 --> 00:53:36.884
- What?
- The apple.


617
00:53:42.467 --> 00:53:46.176
Come on.
Wait. Wait.


618
00:54:17.051 --> 00:54:18.301
Hey, Nanni.

619
00:54:33.051 --> 00:54:37.967
Lovely babies. Lovely babies.
Down you go.


620
00:55:20.092 --> 00:55:21.926
- Hey, Nanni.
- Nanni?


621
00:55:23.426 --> 00:55:25.467
Jesus!
She's pregnant.


622
00:55:25.551 --> 00:55:28.176
Nanni, you're pregnant.
Did you know?


623
00:55:40.884 --> 00:55:42.592
Don't touch me.

624
00:55:42.717 --> 00:55:44.176
Don't touch me.

625
00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:49.092
- The grace of the Lord.
- The grace of the Lord, my foot!


626
00:57:18.842 --> 00:57:20.717
Hold on a minute.

627
00:57:37.592 --> 00:57:39.884
- Have you been to confession?
- No.


628
00:57:41.134 --> 00:57:44.884
You should go to confession.
You need to be at peace with the Lord.


629
00:57:45.051 --> 00:57:48.426
Why? I am at peace with the Lord.
He loves me.


630
00:57:48.551 --> 00:57:52.592
The Lord loves us all, but it's always
good to listen to a confessor's advice.


631
00:57:52.717 --> 00:57:54.176
You're in sin.

632
00:57:54.301 --> 00:57:57.801
Sin?
Mother, I'm in the grace of the Lord.


633
00:57:58.551 --> 00:58:00.301
You don't know what you're saying.

634
00:58:00.426 --> 00:58:04.259
Listen to me. You need to listen to a
confessor's advice.


635
00:58:04.384 --> 00:58:09.509
What does he know?
I'm at peace with the Lord. He loves me.


636
00:58:10.467 --> 00:58:12.342
He's given me his grace.

637
00:58:13.051 --> 00:58:15.967
- Listen.
- I know, it's my conscience.


638
00:58:18.426 --> 00:58:20.301
My conscience...

639
00:58:21.676 --> 00:58:23.342
My conscience is clear.

640
00:58:28.134 --> 00:58:29.926
My conscience...

641
00:59:56.176 --> 01:00:00.967
Get out! Get out!
Get out of here!


642
01:00:01.092 --> 01:00:03.259
- Get out!
- What are you doing?


643
01:00:03.926 --> 01:00:06.301
Leave my spot alone.

644
01:00:06.426 --> 01:00:08.801
Leave my spot alone.

645
01:00:09.676 --> 01:00:14.051
- You gave it to me. Leave it alone.
- Go away!


646
01:00:14.217 --> 01:00:16.926
You gave it to me.
You're the devil!


647
01:00:17.092 --> 01:00:19.801
The devil's in your body.

648
01:00:20.592 --> 01:00:24.176
She's crazy.

649
01:00:24.301 --> 01:00:26.092
Give it to me.

650
01:00:26.217 --> 01:00:28.217
He won't give it back.

651
01:00:28.342 --> 01:00:31.509
You're the devil.
Leave me alone.


652
01:00:32.259 --> 01:00:35.551
That's enough.
That really is enough.


653
01:00:35.676 --> 01:00:40.342
Get out!
Go away!


654
01:00:44.551 --> 01:00:46.592
He's telling me to get out.

655
01:00:47.967 --> 01:00:51.801
- That was my spot.
- Get out!


656
01:00:52.842 --> 01:00:57.342
You gave it to me.
Now you want it back.


657
01:00:57.467 --> 01:01:00.176
I even said a prayer for you.

658
01:01:02.051 --> 01:01:06.676
- Get out.
- You're the devil! You're the devil!


659
01:01:06.759 --> 01:01:10.551
You're the devil!
You're the devil!


660
01:01:10.634 --> 01:01:14.342
Get out!
Go away!


661
01:01:27.134 --> 01:01:29.634
I even said a prayer for you.

662
01:02:46.426 --> 01:02:48.676
Hey, Nanni.
Come here.


663
01:02:48.759 --> 01:02:49.801
Me?

664
01:02:49.926 --> 01:02:54.342
We're not going to bite you, Nanni.
Don't be afraid.


665
01:02:54.467 --> 01:02:56.801
- Me?
- Yes. Come here a minute.


666
01:02:58.217 --> 01:02:59.717
Hold this for me.

667
01:03:01.259 --> 01:03:02.842
Of course.

668
01:03:05.384 --> 01:03:08.676
Felice's gone to Minori.
He's not back yet.


669
01:03:08.801 --> 01:03:12.134
When he goes out
he gets lost in the streets.


670
01:03:12.259 --> 01:03:14.967
When we've finished
you can fetch me some water.


671
01:03:15.134 --> 01:03:17.842
- I can't tire myself out.
- I'll pay you.


672
01:03:17.926 --> 01:03:21.092
- I know, but I can't.
- Come on, it's only a jug of water.


673
01:03:21.217 --> 01:03:26.301
- Will you help me out tomorrow?
- Thank you, but I can't work.


674
01:03:26.426 --> 01:03:28.509
- Why not?
- Well...


675
01:03:28.592 --> 01:03:29.884
That's nonsense.

676
01:03:30.592 --> 01:03:34.384
I stopped working two hours
before giving birth, and I had twins.


677
01:03:34.509 --> 01:03:37.634
- Yes, I know, but...
- You need to sort yourself out.


678
01:03:37.717 --> 01:03:41.759
You're going to have a baby.
You need to put some money aside.


679
01:03:43.342 --> 01:03:45.967
He doesn't need anything.

680
01:03:46.092 --> 01:03:47.884
I can't tire myself out.

681
01:03:48.051 --> 01:03:52.301
If won't even matter if I die of hunger,
but I need to respect him.


682
01:03:52.384 --> 01:03:55.051
Hey, Nanni.
Come here.


683
01:03:55.176 --> 01:03:57.759
Nanni.
Come here.


684
01:03:58.676 --> 01:04:00.384
Yes...
I'm coming.


685
01:04:00.509 --> 01:04:02.384
- Excuse me.
- Off you go.


686
01:04:02.509 --> 01:04:05.217
- Me?
- Hey, Nanni.


687
01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:07.926
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.


688
01:04:09.342 --> 01:04:13.134
Nanni, you've deigned to mingle
with us poor mortals. What an honour.


689
01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:15.551
- Me?
- Yes, you.


690
01:04:15.676 --> 01:04:19.759
You disappeared.
You turned your nose up at us.


691
01:04:23.509 --> 01:04:25.384
Look!
It's Nanni.


692
01:04:29.426 --> 01:04:31.592
- No, don't...
- Why don't you speak to me?


693
01:04:31.717 --> 01:04:35.509
Leave me alone.
What's going on?


694
01:04:35.634 --> 01:04:38.634
- Why is she crying?
- It's the emotion.


695
01:04:38.801 --> 01:04:40.259
The Lord has touched you.

696
01:04:40.384 --> 01:04:42.801
- Come with us.
- No...


697
01:04:44.467 --> 01:04:47.551
- You know who she thinks she is?
- You shouldn't tease her.


698
01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:50.801
- She's become even more stupid.
- Poor woman. Leave her alone.


699
01:04:50.926 --> 01:04:52.717
Poor woman, my foot!

700
01:04:52.842 --> 01:04:54.342
Come on!

701
01:04:54.509 --> 01:04:55.551
Well?

702
01:04:56.509 --> 01:04:58.926
I've always been
outside the Lord's house.


703
01:04:59.592 --> 01:05:01.467
Always outside the Lord's house

704
01:05:01.551 --> 01:05:04.551
because I was afraid
to be amongst you.


705
01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:08.759
I was afraid you'd think I was mad,
but actually...


706
01:05:08.884 --> 01:05:11.509
- What's this?
- You need to wear it like this.


707
01:05:11.967 --> 01:05:15.426
Nanni, they're doing you a great honour,
can't you see?


708
01:05:15.967 --> 01:05:18.926
You're going to throw me out,
aren't you?


709
01:05:19.092 --> 01:05:22.717
This is the Lord's will.
I was meant to come to you.


710
01:05:22.842 --> 01:05:24.092
- Nanni!
- Yes?


711
01:05:24.759 --> 01:05:25.801
Here you go, Nanni.

712
01:05:27.759 --> 01:05:29.051
Nanni!

713
01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:31.801
Nanni!

714
01:05:34.509 --> 01:05:36.759
- Is this for me?
- Yes, it's for you.


715
01:05:37.509 --> 01:05:39.384
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.


716
01:05:40.509 --> 01:05:44.551
- Come with us.
- Thank you.


717
01:06:20.426 --> 01:06:23.134
- Nanni, it suits you.
- No...


718
01:06:23.717 --> 01:06:27.842
No...
What are you doing?


719
01:06:35.926 --> 01:06:39.634
My God, forgive them,
they don't know what they're doing.


720
01:06:42.967 --> 01:06:44.051
No!

721
01:06:44.676 --> 01:06:46.259
That's enough!

722
01:06:46.342 --> 01:06:47.551
No!

723
01:06:47.676 --> 01:06:49.217
That's enough!

724
01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:36.301
They're wicked.

725
01:07:39.801 --> 01:07:44.092
My blessed son,
don't worry, I'll protect you.


726
01:07:44.259 --> 01:07:45.634
My God...

727
01:08:55.759 --> 01:08:58.551
Holy son, holy son.

728
01:08:58.592 --> 01:09:00.342
Beautiful son.

729
01:09:00.467 --> 01:09:03.676
Holy son, holy son.

730
01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:07.926
I'm not worthy, 
I'm too lowly.

731
01:09:08.592 --> 01:09:10.134
My God, help me.

732
01:09:10.634 --> 01:09:12.509
May your will be done.

733
01:11:49.592 --> 01:11:51.342
Oh, God.

734
01:12:34.842 --> 01:12:36.134
Help...

735
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:38.634
Help...

736
01:16:57.217 --> 01:16:58.676
Oh, God.

737
01:17:07.134 --> 01:17:10.926
God...
God, God, God, God, God.


738
01:17:13.342 --> 01:17:15.217
Help...

739
01:17:17.384 --> 01:17:20.051
God, help me.
God, help me.


740
01:17:20.176 --> 01:17:23.217
God, help me.
God, help me.


741
01:17:41.509 --> 01:17:44.467
My God...

742
01:18:10.467 --> 01:18:11.676
God...

743
01:18:11.759 --> 01:18:13.176
God, God, God, God, God.

744
01:18:15.134 --> 01:18:17.551
God...
God...


745
01:18:18.801 --> 01:18:20.051
God...

746
01:18:21.217 --> 01:18:22.634
God...

747
01:18:41.051 --> 01:18:42.717
My God, my God...

748
01:18:45.342 --> 01:18:46.384
My God.

749
01:18:49.801 --> 01:18:51.301
My child.

750
01:18:52.426 --> 01:18:54.592
My baby.

751
01:18:55.259 --> 01:18:57.217
You're my blood.

752
01:18:57.759 --> 01:18:59.509
Mine, mine, mine.

753
01:19:10.467 --> 01:19:13.509
My child, my child.

754
01:19:14.051 --> 01:19:15.884
My child.

755
01:19:17.717 --> 01:19:19.592
My child.

756
01:19:20.676 --> 01:19:22.217
My child.
