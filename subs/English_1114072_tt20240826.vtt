[wind howling]

10
00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:57.563
- Captain Walton.

11
00:01:58.463 --> 00:01:59.931
How's our visitor?

12
00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.864
- I've never seen a man in
so wretched a condition.


13
00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:09.596
He's dreadfully emaciated
by fatigue and suffering.


14
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.997
Lord knows how long
he was on the ice.


15
00:02:13.097 --> 00:02:14.329
- Has he said anything?

16
00:02:15.697 --> 00:02:18.931
- Only nonsense, in rare
moments of consciousness,


17
00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:26.229
about a creature, a
demon, and a pursuit.


18
00:02:27.697 --> 00:02:29.329
[coughing]

19
00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.031
All we can offer him
now is rest and warmth


20
00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:35.031
and hope by slow
degrees he will recover.

[tense music]

23
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:51.731
- Elizabeth?

[bell ringing]

26
00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:31.329
- [Buyer] Do you
have it with you?


27
00:03:32.797 --> 00:03:34.229
- That depends.

28
00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.630
Have you got the payment?

29
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:40.731
- The diary.

30
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:43.664
- It's in me bag.

31
00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:44.797
- Show it to me.

32
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:52.931
- Ah, knew you'd be keen
as soon as I saw it.


33
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:57.296
[tense music]

34
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:04.864
- Remarkable.

35
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.964
The author, this Frankenstein.

36
00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:08.897
- Dead.

37
00:04:08.996 --> 00:04:10.229
He won't mind it gone.

38
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.396
- You said you saw the
creature, his creation.


39
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.097
- Come on board after
I acquired the diary.


40
00:04:19.197 --> 00:04:20.296
Big brute of a thing.

41
00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.664
Tall as a man and
half, inhuman and foul.


42
00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:24.664
Ugly as sin.

43
00:04:27.697 --> 00:04:30.097
- You told no one
about our meeting.


44
00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:32.630
- Man like me knows
how to be discreet.


45
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:35.864
Knows how to cover his tracks.

46
00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:37.697
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


47
00:04:37.797 --> 00:04:38.697
- As do I.

58
00:07:31.297 --> 00:07:32.297
- Hmm.

00:07:37.497 --> 00:07:40.963
[gentle music continues]

[door closing]

63
00:09:05.363 --> 00:09:07.063
- Breakfast, ma'am.

64
00:09:07.163 --> 00:09:08.330
- You didn't need to
ring twice, Martha.


65
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.363
There's nothing wrong
with my hearing.


66
00:09:11.564 --> 00:09:16.263
My love you, you've got
yourself up and dressed.


67
00:09:17.297 --> 00:09:19.896
- It seemed the
thing to do, my dear,


68
00:09:19.996 --> 00:09:22.297
with you working all night.

69
00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:25.664
- I'm sorry I completely
lost track, my darling.


70
00:09:25.763 --> 00:09:28.330
But you must take
care, you know, you,


71
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.430
you could do yourself an injury.

72
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.297
- God, there's nothing wrong
with the old boy really.


73
00:09:33.397 --> 00:09:34.763
I firmly believe his
body's giving up on him


74
00:09:34.863 --> 00:09:36.730
because you spend so much
time running around after him,


75
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.297
he's got nothing to do.

76
00:09:38.397 --> 00:09:40.597
It's Mr. Darwin's theory
of evolution, you know.


77
00:09:41.763 --> 00:09:44.130
- What are you
doing here, William?


78
00:09:44.263 --> 00:09:45.963
Have you no food at your rooms?

79
00:09:46.063 --> 00:09:47.996
- Actually I have, Mother.

80
00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:49.763
I came to say goodbye to Clara.

81
00:09:49.863 --> 00:09:51.497
She's your daughter.

82
00:09:51.597 --> 00:09:55.397
She's, what is it
you're doing again?


83
00:09:56.497 --> 00:09:58.464
A week in the sticks
with Aunt Mabel.


84
00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:01.330
- We haven't got
an old Aunt Mabel.


85
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.830
I am taking a month in the
country with cousin Jane.


86
00:10:06.497 --> 00:10:08.629
- And what pray are you
going to do for a month


87
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.597
in the country with
dear cousin Jane?


88
00:10:10.696 --> 00:10:12.629
- Take long walks in the garden.

89
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.830
Discuss single men in
possession of good fortunes.


90
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:16.830
- Sounds wonderful.

91
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.164
- I'm looking forward to it.

92
00:10:18.297 --> 00:10:19.464
- That's even worse.

93
00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:23.164
- Perhaps you should give
some thought, William,


94
00:10:23.263 --> 00:10:25.564
to your, your own romantic life.

95
00:10:25.663 --> 00:10:29.464
I hear the Hardy girl
has returned from Paris.


96
00:10:29.564 --> 00:10:31.696
Quite a pretty young
thing she is too.


97
00:10:32.663 --> 00:10:33.596
- Hmm.

98
00:10:33.696 --> 00:10:35.263
Perhaps I could marry
that lamp, Mother.


99
00:10:35.363 --> 00:10:36.763
It's just as
pleasing to the eye,


100
00:10:36.863 --> 00:10:39.497
but slightly more skilled
in the art of conversation.


101
00:10:39.596 --> 00:10:41.397
- If only you would attend
the Montgomery Ball.


102
00:10:41.497 --> 00:10:44.564
There are any number
of eligible debutantes.


103
00:10:44.663 --> 00:10:45.996
- So you can hang a
number around their necks


104
00:10:46.098 --> 00:10:47.164
and parade them like cattle.

105
00:10:47.263 --> 00:10:49.430
- I would like to see
a grandchild on my knee


106
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.397
at some point in my life.

107
00:10:51.497 --> 00:10:53.963
- Mother, when you
become a grandmother,


108
00:10:54.063 --> 00:10:56.663
you'll hire a governess, put
her knee to work on your behalf


109
00:10:56.763 --> 00:10:59.464
and see the child twice a
year like you did with us.


110
00:11:01.464 --> 00:11:02.996
Kipper sandwich on the
bicycle, I'm afraid.


111
00:11:03.098 --> 00:11:04.464
I'm late for work.

112
00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:06.230
- Oh, that infernal contraption.

113
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.663
And let us not even start
on the subject of work.


114
00:11:08.763 --> 00:11:11.230
A man in your position, it
really is quite beneath you,


115
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.464
you know, my darling.

116
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.131
- Do you know, I do so
enjoy our little talks.


117
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.830
Funny how you remember
them word for word.


118
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:19.896
Bye old girl.

119
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.830
Try not to have too much fun.

120
00:11:24.198 --> 00:11:25.464
Father.

121
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.497
- I suppose you think
I said the wrong thing?


122
00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:37.896
- No, not the wrong thing.

123
00:11:39.497 --> 00:11:42.896
Just the same thing
over and over again.


124
00:11:42.996 --> 00:11:47.430
Do you not wish for him the
happiness that we have had?


125
00:11:48.497 --> 00:11:52.330
Oh, let him find a
love match as we did.


126
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.830
- My only wish is to restore
you to health, my darling.


127
00:11:58.464 --> 00:11:59.563
And so I will.

128
00:12:06.031 --> 00:12:07.363
- No, no, no no.

129
00:12:07.464 --> 00:12:10.363
She will not listen to
reason, Dr. Browning.


130
00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:13.397
Time and time again she
does only what she wants,


131
00:12:13.496 --> 00:12:16.563
regardless of my clearly
stated preferences.


132
00:12:16.663 --> 00:12:18.696
- Mr. Haddle, as I keep
trying to tell you,


133
00:12:18.796 --> 00:12:21.596
we are not a training
ground for errant wives.


134
00:12:21.696 --> 00:12:23.496
- She needs to be locked up.

135
00:12:23.596 --> 00:12:26.997
She's absconded twice
from sanatoriums


136
00:12:27.098 --> 00:12:28.763
and convalescent homes.

137
00:12:28.863 --> 00:12:31.031
I mean, what do you call
that if not hysteria?


138
00:12:31.131 --> 00:12:32.230
- I call it rather sensible,

139
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.330
if you try to have her
locked up for writing-


140
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.529
- What, poetry?

141
00:12:35.164 --> 00:12:36.330
It's a nonsense!

142
00:12:40.763 --> 00:12:43.263
- Your wife's frustrations
at the bounds you put on her


143
00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:45.430
appear to me to be the
very definition of sanity.


144
00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:47.363
Now if you will
excuse me, Mr. Haddle,


145
00:12:47.463 --> 00:12:49.230
I have patients to attend to.

146
00:12:50.463 --> 00:12:53.230
I fear in the hour
you've been here,


147
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.463
one of them might have
written a limerick.


148
00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.496
- And sedate him, hmm.

149
00:13:06.064 --> 00:13:06.863
Haddle.

150
00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:09.863
Trouble, Browning?

151
00:13:09.964 --> 00:13:12.363
- For some poor woman,
Mr. Brammings, yes.


152
00:13:13.596 --> 00:13:15.363
- There's been another
complaint about conditions here.


153
00:13:15.463 --> 00:13:18.230
A member of parliament
has taken an interest.


154
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.730
- What is it this time?

155
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.529
The food, the cold,
the general conditions.


156
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:24.696
- Do stop trying to guess.

157
00:13:24.796 --> 00:13:27.263
They should be grateful
to be here at all.


158
00:13:27.363 --> 00:13:28.596
They get bed and board.

159
00:13:28.696 --> 00:13:30.997
- They get tied to a
bed and bored stiff.


160
00:13:31.098 --> 00:13:32.796
We do nothing for them and
give them nothing to do.


161
00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.563
Sir, right now, in Paris,
Pierre Janet is doing-


162
00:13:34.663 --> 00:13:38.596
- Spare me another of
your theories, Browning.

We require no
newfangled nonsense,


164
00:13:40.997 --> 00:13:43.830
we are in the business of
bed pans and sedatives,


165
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:47.496
babysitting cast outs
and ne'er do wells.


166
00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:51.397
If you require an asylum

167
00:13:51.496 --> 00:13:53.230
run by a more fanciful
superintendent,


168
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.098
there are many to choose from.

169
00:13:55.198 --> 00:13:56.429
Though none, I believe,

170
00:13:56.529 --> 00:14:00.031
that count your mother
among its trustees.


171
00:14:01.263 --> 00:14:03.863
Perhaps you wouldn't
like your chances there.

- Get off me.
- Lie down.


180

Settle down.
- Get, get off me.

- What's going on in here?

182
00:15:58.763 --> 00:16:02.329
- Ah, here's a
young flap doodle.


183
00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:04.931
- What does it look like?
He's as drunk as ever.


184
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:06.831
We come upon him with two
empty bottles in his arms.


185
00:16:06.931 --> 00:16:08.563
- Well where the devil
did he get those from?


186
00:16:08.663 --> 00:16:10.429
- One of the orderlies
would've brought them in.


187
00:16:10.529 --> 00:16:13.064
On a bribe or a favor,
it shouldn't be allowed.


188
00:16:13.164 --> 00:16:15.997
- Tell you all the ways!

189
00:16:16.098 --> 00:16:17.463
- Keep the noise
down, you old fool.


190
00:16:17.563 --> 00:16:19.463
- You can't speak to your old-

191
00:16:19.563 --> 00:16:20.529
- Quiet!

192
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.997
You'll have Brammings down here.

193
00:16:24.098 --> 00:16:26.496
- [William] What's he in for?
- For his drinking.


194
00:16:26.596 --> 00:16:27.663
He's supposed to be drying out,

195
00:16:27.764 --> 00:16:29.230
and look what
you've done to him.


196
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:33.496
- I may have had one
or two little nips.


197
00:16:33.596 --> 00:16:36.262
- I'll give you a little nip.

198
00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:39.797
- Oh!

199
00:16:39.897 --> 00:16:40.629
Liza.

200
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:42.064
- Now get to bed.

201
00:16:42.164 --> 00:16:44.198
I hope your hangover blows
the top of your head off.


202
00:16:44.296 --> 00:16:46.229
- Now look here, nurse.

203
00:16:46.329 --> 00:16:48.296
We can't have you
assaulting patients.


204
00:16:50.064 --> 00:16:51.229
- What good are
you doing him, eh?


205
00:16:51.329 --> 00:16:52.731
I'd like to know.

206
00:16:52.831 --> 00:16:55.629
He come in here to get well
and he's as drunk as ever.


207
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:57.731
- I'll have a word
with the orderlies.


208
00:16:58.864 --> 00:17:00.764
Perhaps I should
just set you on them.


209
00:17:00.864 --> 00:17:02.696
Might have a rather
greater effect.


210
00:17:03.997 --> 00:17:04.764
- I'm sorry.

211
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:09.262
But is this supposed to
be a hospital or isn't it?


212
00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:12.131
- That's what some of us
are aiming for, certainly.


213
00:17:12.229 --> 00:17:13.864
- We're supposed
to be helping them.


214
00:17:15.262 --> 00:17:16.596
- Indeed we are.

215
00:17:18.897 --> 00:17:22.396
I say, are you new here, I don't
think I've seen you before.


216
00:17:23.831 --> 00:17:25.296
- I started 10 days ago.

217
00:17:25.396 --> 00:17:26.463
I'm Liza.

218
00:17:27.262 --> 00:17:28.596
- I'm William.

219
00:17:28.697 --> 00:17:30.262
Pleased to meet you.
- Yes.


220
00:17:30.362 --> 00:17:32.864
I know who you
are, Dr. Browning.


221
00:17:32.964 --> 00:17:35.596
It don't take 10 days for
our type to notice people.

[birds chirping]

223
00:17:48.463 --> 00:17:50.664
- Ah, it's awfully quiet
here without old Clara.


224
00:17:50.764 --> 00:17:51.764
- Yeah.

225
00:17:51.864 --> 00:17:53.596
She's a bright young thing

226
00:17:53.697 --> 00:17:57.529
and of course your mother
is hard at work downstairs.


227
00:17:58.864 --> 00:18:00.764
- God only knows what
she's got planned for you.


228
00:18:00.864 --> 00:18:02.797
You know, I half expect to see
you stretched out on a rack


229
00:18:02.897 --> 00:18:04.396
every time I come home.

230
00:18:04.496 --> 00:18:08.229
- She is a remarkable
woman, your mother.


231
00:18:08.329 --> 00:18:11.831
If there is a cure for
me, she will find it.


232
00:18:11.931 --> 00:18:14.629
Had she been permitted
to sit examinations,


233
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:18.797
she would've become an expert
renowned on the world stage.


234
00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:21.296
- Yes, while I do agree with
the woman question in general,


235
00:18:21.396 --> 00:18:24.296
Father, I fear in
my mother's case


236
00:18:24.396 --> 00:18:26.296
the world is rather
the safer for it.


237
00:18:27.429 --> 00:18:29.262
[bell ringing]

238
00:18:45.064 --> 00:18:46.964
- Lady Charlotte North, sir.

239
00:18:47.064 --> 00:18:50.496
- Colonel Browning, thank you
for seeing me unannounced.


240
00:18:50.596 --> 00:18:51.664
I had hoped to see you alone,

241
00:18:51.764 --> 00:18:53.630
this is rather a
delicate matter.


242
00:18:55.731 --> 00:18:59.262
- May I introduce
my son William?


243
00:18:59.362 --> 00:19:01.197
Do let him stay.

244
00:19:01.296 --> 00:19:04.964
He may be of some use, I
am rather limited you know.


245
00:19:05.064 --> 00:19:06.429
- Very well.
- Well this is


246
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:08.229
rather unexpected.

247
00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:11.329
How may I help you,
Lady Charlotte?


248
00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:12.630
- I shall get
straight to the point.


249
00:19:12.731 --> 00:19:13.897
You have in your
possession a diary,


250
00:19:13.997 --> 00:19:15.429
I wish to have it in mine.

251
00:19:16.597 --> 00:19:17.563
- A diary?

252
00:19:17.664 --> 00:19:18.463
- It is of little value really,

253
00:19:18.563 --> 00:19:19.797
full of scientific fantasies,

254
00:19:19.897 --> 00:19:23.362
but there's some novelty
to the PT Barnum crowd.


255
00:19:23.463 --> 00:19:25.496
- Scientific fantasies.

256
00:19:25.597 --> 00:19:26.997
Perhaps Milicent can-

257
00:19:27.097 --> 00:19:30.764
- I represent a small group of
collectors of such novelties.


258
00:19:30.864 --> 00:19:32.463
- I can't help you.

259
00:19:32.564 --> 00:19:35.731
May I ask how you came to
believe it was in my possession.


260
00:19:35.831 --> 00:19:38.429
- We have ways of getting
information, Colonel.


261
00:19:38.529 --> 00:19:40.296
The group would be willing
to make you an offer,


262
00:19:40.396 --> 00:19:43.197
a very generous offer, far
in excess of its value.


263
00:19:43.296 --> 00:19:45.529
An offer unlikely
to be repeated.


264
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.163
- You seem very keen for
something of so little value.


265
00:19:49.262 --> 00:19:51.097
- Well, you've been misinformed,

266
00:19:51.197 --> 00:19:52.831
I'm afraid, Lady Charlotte.

267
00:19:52.931 --> 00:19:57.831
I have no such diary and no
interest in any such diary.


268
00:19:57.931 --> 00:19:59.329
Perhaps my wife-

269
00:19:59.429 --> 00:20:00.997
- Your wife is unlikely
to be interested, Colonel.


270
00:20:01.097 --> 00:20:04.030
It is not concerned with lace
making and letter writing.


271
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.897
- Oh, how little
you know my wife.


272
00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:09.197
- I must say, the nobility
seem rather less noble


273
00:20:09.296 --> 00:20:10.931
than we've been led to believe.

274
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.731
- That rather settles it.

275
00:20:12.831 --> 00:20:14.597
I'm unable to help you.

276
00:20:25.931 --> 00:20:29.262
- I shall have that
diary, Colonel Browning.


277
00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:30.564
One way or another.

278
00:20:34.697 --> 00:20:35.731
- [Millicent] What
was that about?


279
00:20:35.831 --> 00:20:36.797
- Hmm?

280
00:20:36.897 --> 00:20:39.597
Oh, haven't the foggiest.

281
00:20:39.697 --> 00:20:42.664
I say, dear, you
haven't by any chance-


282
00:20:42.764 --> 00:20:43.897
- Are you sure
you'll be all right


283
00:20:43.996 --> 00:20:44.864
by yourself tonight, my love?

284
00:20:44.964 --> 00:20:47.030
I really do feel most
dreadfully guilty.


285
00:20:48.931 --> 00:20:50.897
William, could you
not stay the night?


286
00:20:50.996 --> 00:20:52.030
- What's all this?

287
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.996
- Your mother has
an overnight trip


288
00:20:54.097 --> 00:20:56.864
in aid of her experiments.

289
00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:57.964
- I really must go.

290
00:20:58.864 --> 00:21:02.964
A rather promising
contact who has an item


291
00:21:03.063 --> 00:21:04.362
essential to my work.

292
00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:05.897
- Eye of newt?

293
00:21:07.564 --> 00:21:09.063
I've taken the night
shift, I'm afraid.

The old boy will have to
look after himself for once.


295
00:21:11.362 --> 00:21:13.530
- Perhaps I should sleep
in the main house tonight-


296
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.262
- I shall be perfectly fine.

297
00:21:16.362 --> 00:21:19.130
The only bother will
be how to occupy myself


298
00:21:19.229 --> 00:21:20.864
with so little happening.

299
00:21:27.464 --> 00:21:28.897
- The old boy go for your story?

300
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.396
- Did he cop for having it?

301
00:21:30.497 --> 00:21:32.630
- We require an approach
with rather less subtlety.

Get out.

You gave us a little bit
of a fright there, old boy.

You've been out
cold for three days.

in a day or two.

a hundred years older.

Taking the blaggards

lost your fighting spirit.

of it, I think.

Father would want you to have
every chance of happiness


485

you possibly can.

486
00:36:59.197 --> 00:37:00.997
You can go from cousin Jane's.

487
00:37:01.097 --> 00:37:04.229
You'll look lovelier than ever
next to that old wallflower.


488
00:37:05.964 --> 00:37:06.931
- And what about you?

me, old girl, I'll be fine.

It's too awful to
even contemplate.


510

- He cannot be gone.

He would never have left me.

There's money to
be made, I'm sure.

It's an outrage.

- Have you retrieved any
of the poor souls taken?

aware of, sir, no.

We'll endeavor to do
our best, of course,

I was rushed when reattaching
your leg, I was clumsy.


525
00:44:14.098 --> 00:44:15.830
It will not heal.

526
00:44:18.263 --> 00:44:20.363
You need a new leg.

527
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:22.430
A new body.

This may be it, Robert.

You need a clean body.

541
00:45:47.397 --> 00:45:50.496
Clean and unpolluted,
a fresh body.


542

Freshly killed.

much point in going home.

shift as soon as I get in.

hour's sleep standing up

00:46:07.663 --> 00:46:09.463
so I don't crumple my clothes.

- Could do with a shave and all.

- Old Bramming
said about as much.

No doubt the entirety
of Western civilization

with a bristle on his chin.

- Yeah.

The girls said that
he, he passed away.

But I say that there
must be some mistake.

He was as healthy
as a horse, he was-

- No, no, no, no, it's
quite true, I'm afraid.

- No.

- His heart probably gave out.

569
00:48:39.297 --> 00:48:41.629
He must have given it
dog's abuse over the years.

wrong with his heart.

alone when he passed.

terribly sad, I suppose.

with this place.

formed such a bond with him.

Would you like to see him?

There may be an autopsy

589
00:49:51.596 --> 00:49:53.696
but I would say given his
age and history he prob--

00:49:55.964 --> 00:49:56.696
He's gone.

snatchers have come here too?

- Body snatchers?

594
00:50:06.164 --> 00:50:07.529
You mean he's been robbed?

595
00:50:09.229 --> 00:50:11.429
You were meant to be
looking after him.


596
00:50:11.529 --> 00:50:12.931
How could you let this happen?

597

Ain't safe.

605
00:51:36.362 --> 00:51:38.764
- I'm not sure I much care
what happens to me now.


606

- I didn't know that your father
had been taken too when I.

- Do you wanna hit me back?

were to come to blows

I'd be much the worse for wear.

give me a plot.

A pauper's patch.

Somewhere I could stand and
pretend his body was in there.

He was my father, Alfred.

616

I was too ashamed to say

and then ashamed of
how ashamed I was.

It weren't your fault.

621

He said,

622
00:52:27.262 --> 00:52:30.064
he said you were
decent with him.


623
00:52:30.163 --> 00:52:32.630
Treated him like a human being.

624
00:52:32.731 --> 00:52:33.764
Like a man.

you're walking me home.

How is it you've done so
well for yourself, Liza?

given the chance.

These people aren't here
because they drink and do wrong.

They drink and do wrong
'cause they're here.

And it's not us
which puts us here.

You don't let us live, your lot.

someone at it.


649

Have you seen
anything suspicious?


652

- Only you lurking in the dark.

653
00:54:35.497 --> 00:54:38.329
- I, I hope you've eliminated
me from your inquiries.

before setback and illness

It was ours.

We invented it.

665
00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:36.731
We were why people sing,

This is a surprise.

678
00:56:42.330 --> 00:56:44.130
- [Millicent] I'd hoped
to see you, Brammings,


679
00:56:44.229 --> 00:56:46.630
to talk over recent events.

680
00:56:46.731 --> 00:56:47.797
- Of course.

681
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:50.030
Of course.

682
00:56:51.296 --> 00:56:53.464
I was very sorry to
hear of your loss.


683
00:56:53.564 --> 00:56:55.464
Of course you have
my condolences.

Young William appears to
be bearing up bravely.


685

- His loss is not on the
same scale as my own.


686
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.963
- Quite, quite.

687
00:57:04.063 --> 00:57:05.363
Well, you wish to discuss?

688
00:57:05.464 --> 00:57:07.497
- Recent events, Brammings.

689
00:57:08.697 --> 00:57:09.930
- Well the
disappearing drunkard,


690
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:11.863
have the trustees some concerns?

691
00:57:11.963 --> 00:57:13.297
I can assure you that-

692
00:57:13.397 --> 00:57:15.697
- I can assure you
I have no interest


693
00:57:15.796 --> 00:57:17.597
in the concerns of
the other trustees,


694
00:57:17.697 --> 00:57:19.863
or in the disappearances
of the wastrels


695
00:57:19.963 --> 00:57:21.262
that you house here.

696
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:25.229
Nor in their lives.

697
00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:31.363
On that, I feel
sure we can agree.


698
00:57:32.363 --> 00:57:33.597
- Well I,

699
00:57:36.464 --> 00:57:37.630
of course I have, as you know,

700
00:57:37.731 --> 00:57:40.229
been rather at odds with
your son on the matter.


701
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:45.363
As for the lives
of our patients,


702
00:57:45.464 --> 00:57:47.430
I would agree that many
of them are better served


703
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:50.863
by the workhouse or the courts.

704
00:57:50.963 --> 00:57:51.963
- Or the gallows?

705
00:57:53.664 --> 00:57:57.497
- Well, in certain
cases, perhaps.


706
00:57:57.597 --> 00:57:59.430
- You have always
struck me, Brammings,


707
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:03.130
as a man of ambition,

708
00:58:03.229 --> 00:58:06.030
of advancement.

709
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:10.030
A man whose career would
not be slowed by idle gossip


710
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:11.397
regarding female patients.

711
00:58:11.497 --> 00:58:12.830
- Now I really don't think-

712
00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:16.430
- A man who knows the value
of a sympathetic ally.


713
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:17.664
- Indeed I was grateful-

714
00:58:17.763 --> 00:58:20.197
- A man who looks
for opportunity


715
00:58:20.297 --> 00:58:22.263
and yet knows when to look away.

716
00:58:23.330 --> 00:58:24.763
Against your ambition,

717
00:58:24.863 --> 00:58:28.730
against a considerable
rise in income,


718
00:58:30.996 --> 00:58:32.397
what do these people matter?

719
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:37.230
What does one care
for the ants underfoot


720
00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:39.963
as one advances
towards greatness?


721
00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:44.896
What would it matter
if others were to


722
00:58:44.996 --> 00:58:47.996
leave this establishment
earlier than expected?


723
00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:50.063
- Quite, quite.

724
00:58:50.163 --> 00:58:53.130
You, you said a rise in income.

725
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:54.763
- A considerable rise.

726
00:58:57.664 --> 00:59:00.630
100 pounds for each of them.

727
00:59:02.363 --> 00:59:06.097
- Their lives may be
worthless, but my cooperation,


728
00:59:06.198 --> 00:59:08.963
however, is not.

729
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:12.297
500.

730
00:59:14.198 --> 00:59:15.297
- Very well, 500.

731
00:59:15.397 --> 00:59:16.430
- And only the men.

732
00:59:17.564 --> 00:59:20.896
- The women, Brammings,
shall remain untouched.


733
00:59:20.996 --> 00:59:23.030
- And any more idle gossip.

734
00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:24.464
- Will be silenced.

735
00:59:26.497 --> 00:59:28.663
- How nice to have
things out in the open.


736
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:32.030
I must say, I thought
you only cold.


737
00:59:33.497 --> 00:59:35.430
I could scarcely have imagined
that underneath all that


738
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:37.330
you were such a malignant bitch.

739
00:59:39.363 --> 00:59:41.230
Now what do you require of me?

740
00:59:45.063 --> 00:59:46.330
- An open door.

741
00:59:47.863 --> 00:59:48.996
And a blind eye.

742
00:59:56.164 --> 00:59:58.497
- So this is how you
lot spend your time.


743
00:59:58.597 --> 01:00:00.530
- Less glamorous
than you expected.


744
01:00:00.629 --> 01:00:03.464
- If I'd have known I would've
left my tiara at home.


745
01:00:04.863 --> 01:00:06.663
- It's not all it's
cracked up to be, you know.


746
01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:10.131
I feel like I've
spent my entire life


747
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:11.497
running away from money.

748

Finds you, somehow,
wealth and privilege.


749
01:00:17.263 --> 01:00:20.464
Just becomes expectation
and boundaries.


750
01:00:25.198 --> 01:00:26.896
I do realize how
spoilt that sounds


751
01:00:26.996 --> 01:00:30.663
and I know I'm very fortunate
to have these as problems.

than wondering

where your next meal's
gonna come from.


754

Though I am surprised
at how unspoilt you are.

You're the only
person of your class

who I've not wanted
to kick in the knee.


757
01:00:44.297 --> 01:00:45.263
- You did punch me in the face.

758
01:00:45.363 --> 01:00:46.763
- That's what I'm saying.

759
01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:53.164
- My father was very
keen for me to understand

01:00:53.263 --> 01:00:54.763
the true value of money.

761

Its limitations, that there
are many more important things.

him, didn't you?


763

Your father.

764
01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.830
- Yeah, I did.

765
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:17.497
He was a very good man.

766
01:01:20.996 --> 01:01:23.796
- Mine was flawed,

767
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:29.430
but I loved him all the same.

768
01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:32.930
- I wonder where they are now.

769

- We'll find them.

770

Though whoever's took
them's getting themselves

a steady supply of bodies.

772
01:01:38.596 --> 01:01:39.896
- I'd say that's a thing.

773
01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:43.297
Where there's supply.

774
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:46.430
- There's demand.

01:03:41.429 --> 01:03:43.297
Was he in the loony
bin with old Alfred?


810
01:03:43.397 --> 01:03:47.131
- No, he was-
- He got dug up.


811
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:48.863
Proper sacrilegious it was.

812
01:03:50.663 --> 01:03:52.529
- I'd heard there was
some of that going on.


813
01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:54.529
- Well that's why we're here.

814
01:03:54.629 --> 01:03:55.463
There's nothing
goes on around here


815
01:03:55.563 --> 01:03:57.263
without you hearing about it.

816
01:03:58.596 --> 01:04:00.897
Or you having a
hand in it yourself,


817
01:04:00.997 --> 01:04:02.763
if you get whiff of a coin.

818
01:04:02.863 --> 01:04:05.131
- Oi, I hope you don't
think I'm involved


819
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:06.496
in none of that, my girl.

820
01:04:06.596 --> 01:04:08.463
I've been known to buy and sell

821
01:04:08.563 --> 01:04:11.263
the occasional item of interest.

822
01:04:11.363 --> 01:04:13.730
Them what's dead should
be left in peace I say.


823
01:04:16.629 --> 01:04:18.596
I may not go by
every law of the land


824
01:04:19.663 --> 01:04:21.997
but the laws of God and
nature is different.


825
01:04:23.263 --> 01:04:24.931
- Maybe you heard
something about it.


826
01:04:25.031 --> 01:04:25.763
- Nothing.

827
01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:30.529
- Then maybe you could
inquire among your associates.


828
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:32.496
- And ask them what?

829
01:04:33.529 --> 01:04:35.330
Anyone in the
market for a spleen.


830
01:04:37.429 --> 01:04:40.362
I'll tell you, I've
not heard a thing


831
01:04:40.463 --> 01:04:42.263
and that means
something, don't it.


832
01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:45.629
It means it ain't
one of ours doing it.


833
01:04:50.696 --> 01:04:54.396
Last round of body
snatching a few years back,


834
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:58.396
they wasn't being taken for
food or for throwing on the fire


835
01:04:58.496 --> 01:05:00.131
instead of coal, was they?

836
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.329
They was being taken
for men of science


837
01:05:04.696 --> 01:05:07.730
picking over their bones,
seeing what made them tick.


838
01:05:07.831 --> 01:05:10.463
[tense music]

839
01:05:10.563 --> 01:05:13.064
Alfred got took from
your place, didn't he?


840
01:05:13.164 --> 01:05:14.496
- Mm-hmm.

841
01:05:14.596 --> 01:05:17.031
- You wanna find
them what took him?


842
01:05:17.131 --> 01:05:19.964
I suggest you look
closer to home.


843
01:05:20.064 --> 01:05:23.463
[tense music continues]

844
01:05:27.831 --> 01:05:30.396
- Did you hear the
devil's footsteps.


845
01:05:31.429 --> 01:05:33.864
Click, click, click,
click it goes.


846
01:05:33.964 --> 01:05:37.296
I can keep traveling.

847
01:05:37.396 --> 01:05:40.529
[footsteps thumping]

848
01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:46.230
It's come to take me, hasn't it.

849
01:05:46.329 --> 01:05:49.296
Sit with them cooking in pantry.

850
01:05:49.396 --> 01:05:51.964
Walking in the square.

851
01:05:52.064 --> 01:05:53.797
Meant to dance.

852
01:05:53.897 --> 01:05:55.763
What a very nice time.

853
01:05:55.864 --> 01:05:58.629
[dramatic music]

854
01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:14.031
- There's been another
one on the fourth floor.


855
01:06:17.198 --> 01:06:18.198
One here and all?

856
01:06:18.296 --> 01:06:19.296
- Yes, I think so.

857
01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:20.064
What do you mean another one?

858
01:06:20.164 --> 01:06:21.563
- Do calm down.

859
01:06:21.663 --> 01:06:25.563
Two patients have
simply chosen to leave.


860
01:06:25.663 --> 01:06:27.864
- Two patients in restraints

861
01:06:27.964 --> 01:06:30.629
have chosen to leave
from behind locked doors.


862
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:33.629
- Really, you must not
apply reason to madness.


863
01:06:34.362 --> 01:06:35.663
Is there any blood?

864
01:06:36.463 --> 01:06:38.429
Any disturbance?

865
01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:40.731
Any signs of a struggle?

866
01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:43.731
A struggle, Browning.

867
01:06:43.831 --> 01:06:45.663
Not poor housekeeping.

868
01:06:47.396 --> 01:06:48.463
- Mr. Brammings.

869
01:06:50.164 --> 01:06:52.031
Mr. Brammings.

870
01:06:52.131 --> 01:06:54.629
There's something desperately
wrong in this place, sir.


871
01:06:54.731 --> 01:06:56.797
First Alfred Dobson,
now these two.


872
01:06:58.031 --> 01:06:59.362
- I see no similarities.

873
01:07:00.696 --> 01:07:03.198
What happened with the
drunkard was unfortunate.


874
01:07:03.296 --> 01:07:06.429
But what you have this
morning are two empty beds,


875
01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:11.197
no bodies, and an
overactive imagination.


876
01:07:11.296 --> 01:07:13.563
- What you have
this morning, sir,


877
01:07:13.663 --> 01:07:16.362
is patients disappearing
on your watch.


878
01:07:16.463 --> 01:07:17.596
Now I know you
don't care anything


879
01:07:17.697 --> 01:07:19.098
about these people
at all, you old fool,


880
01:07:19.197 --> 01:07:20.362
but you do still have
a duty towards them.


881
01:07:20.463 --> 01:07:22.098
- Now see here, you jumped up-

882
01:07:22.197 --> 01:07:23.164
- Get off me.

883
01:07:23.262 --> 01:07:24.697
[Liza gasps]

884
01:07:32.296 --> 01:07:34.897
[tense music]

885
01:07:36.731 --> 01:07:39.897
We swore an oath to
these men, Brammings,


886
01:07:41.463 --> 01:07:45.496
to do them no harm and to
see no harm done to them.


887
01:07:45.596 --> 01:07:50.664
- And two empty beds aside,
there remain many more in here


888
01:07:51.764 --> 01:07:56.429
in need of your fussy,
nannying bedside manner.


889
01:07:57.797 --> 01:08:01.362
Now may I suggest
you learn your place


890
01:08:01.463 --> 01:08:04.629
and get back to work!

891
01:08:05.529 --> 01:08:08.931
[tense music continues]

892
01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:12.964
- Now what?

893
01:08:14.098 --> 01:08:15.596
What can we do?

894
01:08:15.697 --> 01:08:17.163
What with old
Brammings in the way?


895
01:08:17.262 --> 01:08:20.197
[tense music continues]

896
01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:22.529
- Now we go over his head.

897
01:08:24.262 --> 01:08:25.997
We go to the trustees.

898
01:08:27.163 --> 01:08:29.130
Mother!

899
01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:32.630
[tense music continues]

01:08:37.262 --> 01:08:39.831
[flies buzzing]

901
01:08:54.329 --> 01:08:55.931
Mother!

902

[thumping on door]

905
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.964
Mother!

[thumping on door continues]

907
01:09:27.564 --> 01:09:28.463
Mother!

908
01:09:39.329 --> 01:09:41.329
- [Millicent] What
are you doing here?


909
01:09:43.664 --> 01:09:45.329
- Are you quite
all right, Mother?


910
01:09:45.429 --> 01:09:46.496
Where are the staff?

911
01:09:47.496 --> 01:09:48.797
- I have dismissed them.

912
01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:50.831
I no longer require
their services.


913
01:09:52.831 --> 01:09:54.864
- It would appear you
have a very great need


914
01:09:54.964 --> 01:09:56.030
of their services.

915
01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:57.864
- I have been
rather preoccupied.


916
01:09:57.964 --> 01:10:01.030
I will get to these
things this afternoon.


917
01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:05.229
[tense music]

918
01:10:05.329 --> 01:10:06.296
- Let me help you.

919
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:10.864
- I prefer to be alone.

920
01:10:10.964 --> 01:10:11.831
- Of course.

921
01:10:13.564 --> 01:10:14.731
But with Father gone.

922
01:10:14.831 --> 01:10:16.831
- I asked you what
you're doing here.


923
01:10:16.931 --> 01:10:20.329
[tense music continues]

924
01:10:21.897 --> 01:10:23.229
- Fear not.

925
01:10:24.731 --> 01:10:26.597
I come in a purely
professional capacity.


926
01:10:26.697 --> 01:10:28.063
There's trouble at the asylum.

927
01:10:28.163 --> 01:10:30.296
- Then I suggest you
speak to Mr. Brammings.


928
01:10:30.396 --> 01:10:31.262
- I have.

929
01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:34.463
There have been disappearances,

930
01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.362
he shows very little interest.

931
01:10:36.463 --> 01:10:38.396
- I can assure you I have less.

932
01:10:38.497 --> 01:10:41.597
- And yet you have
a responsibility
towards our patients,


933
01:10:41.697 --> 01:10:43.329
whether you care
for them or not.


934
01:10:43.429 --> 01:10:45.996
- What would you have me
do, become a night watchman?


935
01:10:46.097 --> 01:10:48.697
- I would have you call a
meeting of the trustees.


936
01:10:48.797 --> 01:10:51.831
Demand Brammings explain
himself and if he cannot,


937
01:10:51.931 --> 01:10:53.996
I would have you replace him.

938
01:10:54.931 --> 01:10:55.864
- Very well.

939
01:10:57.831 --> 01:10:58.964
- You will do so?

940
01:10:59.063 --> 01:11:00.329
- Certainly I shall.

941
01:11:00.429 --> 01:11:04.163
[tense music continues]

942
01:11:04.262 --> 01:11:05.963
- I'm fine by the way.

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:09.931
And Clara too, she has written.

[fire crackling]

947
01:11:26.864 --> 01:11:28.664
- You were well paid
for your information.


948
01:11:28.764 --> 01:11:31.630
Information that came
to be quite incorrect.


949
01:11:31.731 --> 01:11:33.931
I believed you were a
man who knew things.


950
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:35.764
- And so I am.

951
01:11:37.197 --> 01:11:39.697
Only I never told
you nothing as fact.


952
01:11:39.797 --> 01:11:41.630
Only what I'd heard.

953
01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:43.864
I can't do no better than that.

954
01:11:43.963 --> 01:11:47.262
- You must do much better,
I am not to be disappointed.


955
01:11:47.362 --> 01:11:49.262
The man you claimed had
the items in his possession


956
01:11:49.362 --> 01:11:50.764
is now dead.

957
01:11:50.864 --> 01:11:53.630
His body stolen, his house
searched without result.


958
01:11:53.731 --> 01:11:56.097
I believe we can rule him out.

959
01:11:56.197 --> 01:11:57.864
- It wasn't him what got them.

960
01:11:59.229 --> 01:12:01.464
It was him they was got for.

961
01:12:02.797 --> 01:12:05.329
It was his wife
what bought them.


962
01:12:07.197 --> 01:12:08.797
It was his wife, I tell you.

963
01:12:08.897 --> 01:12:10.130
It was his wife.

if we're staking out the place.

01:12:30.097 --> 01:12:30.963
- Right.

968
01:12:33.197 --> 01:12:34.797
- Well now I feel stupid.

969
01:12:37.329 --> 01:12:39.630
- I assure you, you've
never looked lovelier.

old Brammings caught
us sneaking about.

Brammings is in on it?

Yet he cares so little
for these people.

themselves, even in death.

Their crypts are
locked up tight,

I'm surprised your

He was rich enough.

- Mother was dead
set against it.

She's gone rather
strange since he died.

have spoken to her.

She's looked clear through them

as if she's not
seen them at all.

If I could revive
his intelligence,


1036

he would wish to be
brought back to me.

You cannot begin to
understand the love we share.

And you didn't share it.

You kept it all to yourself.

1041
01:16:47.097 --> 01:16:52.330
- Just too great a cruelty
to have loved so deeply

01:16:53.131 --> 01:16:54.297
and have lost so completely.

1043

is the debt we pay

for loving so richly and
being loved in return.

Victor Frankenstein.


1135
01:23:44.098 --> 01:23:45.198
- What's that?

1136
01:23:45.296 --> 01:23:47.329
- The Frankenstein diary
possesses knowledge


1137
01:23:47.429 --> 01:23:49.362
unimaginable to humanity.

1138
01:23:50.496 --> 01:23:51.764
Your mother had it
in her possession


1139
01:23:51.864 --> 01:23:53.362
and with it raised hell.

1140
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:56.764
- Now you want it for yourself.

1141
01:23:56.864 --> 01:23:57.731
- For myself?

1142
01:23:58.831 --> 01:24:00.697
No, you fool, I
want it destroyed.


1143
01:24:02.529 --> 01:24:05.229
Man has forever
sought to cheat death.


1144
01:24:05.329 --> 01:24:06.563
To create life.

1145
01:24:06.663 --> 01:24:09.463
To assume the power of the gods.

1146
01:24:09.563 --> 01:24:12.429
The Frankenstein diary
knows their power.


1147
01:24:12.529 --> 01:24:15.563
It whispers its
secrets, makes promises,


1148
01:24:15.663 --> 01:24:18.697
and brings only death and
destruction and despair.


1149
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:23.529
A century ago Victor
Frankenstein raised a demon.


1150
01:24:24.864 --> 01:24:26.764
His wife and brother were
murdered at its hand.


1151
01:24:27.864 --> 01:24:31.396
Frankenstein himself
died a pitiful wretch.


1152
01:24:31.496 --> 01:24:34.964
His diary lived on, its
trail of destruction resumed.


1153
01:24:36.664 --> 01:24:39.031
Down through the years our
collective has hunted it,


1154
01:24:39.131 --> 01:24:41.964
following every lead with
a necessary ruthlessness.


1155

Bringing me finally to you.

1156
01:24:48.064 --> 01:24:49.163
- So what now?

1157
01:24:49.296 --> 01:24:50.997
- Now its work is alive
and out in the world


1158
01:24:51.098 --> 01:24:54.496
ready to kill and destroy
anything it comes upon.


1159
01:24:54.596 --> 01:24:56.163
- What about my father?

1160
01:24:56.262 --> 01:24:56.997
- He's dead.

1161
01:24:58.064 --> 01:24:59.731
- I saw him in there.

1162
01:24:59.831 --> 01:25:02.463
There's some part of
him that's still alive.


1163
01:25:02.563 --> 01:25:04.664
- You saw only what
you wish to see.


1164
01:25:04.764 --> 01:25:08.396
The creature he has become must
be destroyed with the diary.


1165
01:25:08.496 --> 01:25:09.864
I shall see it done.

1166
01:25:09.964 --> 01:25:10.731
- Wait.

1167
01:25:13.529 --> 01:25:14.897
My mother made that thing.

1168
01:25:17.563 --> 01:25:19.897
It's my responsibility too.

1169
01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:25.864
- I didn't see
nothing as I come in.


1170
01:25:25.964 --> 01:25:27.098
- Could he be hiding?

1171
01:25:27.197 --> 01:25:28.097
Does he have the intelligence?

1172
01:25:28.197 --> 01:25:31.130
- He is an
it, it has only fury.

A demon straight
from hell it was.

Tore into him like
he was nothing.

if it was an inch.

- And the smell, lord.

- Which way did he go?

darkness it went.

We should go after it is what.

has a chance to go for us.

- Well, not as such.

- Sort of cowered
when it seen us.

- But you could tell it would
go for us if it got a chance.

it is not your father.
