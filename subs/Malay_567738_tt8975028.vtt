I was-I've had
a profession.


167
00:13:21.807 --> 00:13:23.609
The legal profession.

168
00:13:25.344 --> 00:13:28.047
I live on the outskirts
of the city.


169
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.852
I was in my driveway
when I was taken.


170
00:13:33.854 --> 00:13:36.855
I have been taken.

171
00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:40.458
I don't know what I can or
cannot say if I do not know


172
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.327
the purpose of
my being here.


173
00:13:42.329 --> 00:13:44.464
You can discourse on
whatever you want.


174
00:13:47.834 --> 00:13:49.601
I was physically taken.

175
00:13:49.603 --> 00:13:52.470
Unloading groceries from
the back of my car.


176
00:13:52.472 --> 00:13:55.908
My wife and I have lived in that
house for over thirty years.


177
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.911
So she or one of the neighbours
will see the groceries


178
00:13:58.913 --> 00:14:00.612
in the driveway.

179
00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:03.415
I don't know whether you
left a ransom note or not.


180
00:14:03.417 --> 00:14:05.618
But obviously someone
will call the police...


181
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.886
<i>Stop it.</i>

182
00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:08.921
This only works if you
tell the whole truth.


183
00:14:08.923 --> 00:14:11.189
What am I saying
that is not true?


184
00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:12.190
You.

185
00:14:12.192 --> 00:14:13.326
Fuck you.

186
00:14:13.328 --> 00:14:15.328
No, no, no. Please, no.

187
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.329
I didn't mean that.

188
00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:19.767
That wasn't me. 
That wasn't me.

189
00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:24.704
Uh, I do home

190
00:14:24.706 --> 00:14:27.740
Specialize in roofing.

191
00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.241
To the camera.

192
00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:30.645
Tell them your name.

193
00:14:32.447 --> 00:14:34.815
My name is Ron.

194
00:14:34.817 --> 00:14:37.851
I have two children

195
00:14:37.853 --> 00:14:40.419
who are expecting me home
tonight for dinner.


196
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:42.422
<i>And all I was doing
was going through</i>


197

<i>That's a lie.</i>

199
00:14:48.664 --> 00:14:50.597
What? You mean the
parking lot thing?


200
00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:52.399
Okay, I was going to
the drive-through


201
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:55.402
and then I pulled over at the
edge of the parking lot


202
00:14:55.404 --> 00:14:57.204
<i>to check my tires
like I do.</i>


203
00:14:57.206 --> 00:15:00.407
And then I get out and then
I get cracked on the head,


204
00:15:00.409 --> 00:15:03.210
and then I'm in a sack and
we were pulling away


205
00:15:03.212 --> 00:15:04.812

is this about?!

two little kids

215
00:15:41.484 --> 00:15:45.487

could speak with him.


314
00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:21.200

bag over my head


315
00:21:21.202 --> 00:21:23.835

off my nose.

00:37:22.126 --> 00:37:24.159
not what we
think we know.


637
00:37:24.161 --> 00:37:27.095
(NEWS BULLETIN MUSIC)

638
00:37:27.097 --> 00:37:28.630
Good afternoon.

639
00:37:28.632 --> 00:37:30.333
Harper Grant with a
special USCN report.


640
00:37:30.335 --> 00:37:31.733
Here's what we know.

641
00:37:31.735 --> 00:37:33.602
God help us.

642
00:37:33.604 --> 00:37:34.603
<i>The judge who tried the
Claudine Jeeter abduction</i>


643
00:37:34.605 --> 00:37:35.871
<i>and murder trial,</i>

644
00:37:35.873 --> 00:37:37.806
has himself apparently
been abducted


645
00:37:37.808 --> 00:37:40.143
and is now being held at an
undisclosed location.


646
00:37:40.145 --> 00:37:41.743
The abduction, however,

647
00:37:41.745 --> 00:37:43.780
is being broadcast live
across social media.


648
00:37:43.782 --> 00:37:45.982
<i>To help fill in pieces of
the puzzle here</i>


649
00:37:45.984 --> 00:37:48.084
<i>is USCN's own
Jean Treblis. Jean?</i>


650
00:37:48.086 --> 00:37:50.086
Well Harper, It's kind
of early to say,


651
00:37:50.088 --> 00:37:52.088
but it looks like that
what's happening is...


652
00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.690
...Some of the concerns about how
Justice Oliver Straight tried


653
00:37:54.692 --> 00:37:56.726
the Jeeter case are
coming home to roost?


654
00:37:56.728 --> 00:37:58.761
<i>JEAN: You can look
at it that way.</i>


655
00:37:58.763 --> 00:38:00.163
Did you ever hear
anyone question


656
00:38:00.165 --> 00:38:02.632
how Judge Straight
handled the case?


657
00:38:02.634 --> 00:38:04.033
They will now.

658
00:38:04.035 --> 00:38:06.903
At the least we know that
a member of the public


659
00:38:06.905 --> 00:38:08.972
has decided to
question the trial.


660
00:38:08.974 --> 00:38:13.210
<i>HARPER: And perhaps even
that verdict is in question.</i>


661
00:38:13.212 --> 00:38:16.246
Now Darnley made references to
credit checks and overdue bills.


662
00:38:16.248 --> 00:38:18.048
There could be
something there.


663
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:20.119
Where are they pulling
this stuff from?


664
00:38:22.054 --> 00:38:23.087
Who's this?

665
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:24.221
It's the IT team.

666
00:38:24.223 --> 00:38:25.355
You're kidding.

667
00:38:25.357 --> 00:38:26.356
They're all in the
new building.


668
00:38:26.358 --> 00:38:28.092
What can you
tell me?


669
00:38:28.094 --> 00:38:29.693
We can't trace a stream to
a social media interface.


670
00:38:29.695 --> 00:38:31.128
Why not?

671
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.864
Isn't he using their server
or whatever it is?


672
00:38:33.866 --> 00:38:36.733
Think of it as telephone that's
been redirected fifteen times.


673
00:38:36.735 --> 00:38:38.203
So he's smart in
that way?


674
00:38:38.205 --> 00:38:39.270
Pretty much.

675
00:38:39.272 --> 00:38:40.939
Can't they
take him off?


676
00:38:40.941 --> 00:38:42.874
They could of course shut
the whole thing down,


677
00:38:42.876 --> 00:38:45.709
but then there's nothing to say
he couldn't just show up


678
00:38:45.711 --> 00:38:46.845
<i>on any other
platform.</i>


679
00:38:46.847 --> 00:38:48.746
Yeah, it's a bad
idea anyway.


680
00:38:48.748 --> 00:38:51.983
And we would lose our only means
of knowing what he's up to.


681
00:38:51.985 --> 00:38:53.351
(PHONE RINGING)

682
00:38:53.353 --> 00:38:56.020
Can we limit the reach
or whatever you call it.


683
00:38:56.022 --> 00:38:57.155
Possibly.

684
00:38:57.157 --> 00:38:58.156
Will he know if
we do that?


685
00:38:58.158 --> 00:38:59.358
<i>Almost certainly.</i>

686
00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.359
<i>How can you
be so sure?</i>


687
00:39:00.361 --> 00:39:02.093
<i>He broke into</i>

688
00:39:02.095 --> 00:39:03.362
<i>one of the world's
most controlled websites,</i>


689
00:39:03.364 --> 00:39:04.796
bootlegged a live signal
without a trace


690
00:39:04.798 --> 00:39:06.232
and scrambled it a
half dozen times...


691
00:39:06.234 --> 00:39:08.267
<i>my guess is he's smart
enough to track</i>


692
00:39:08.269 --> 00:39:09.868
<i>what's happening
on his own site.</i>


693
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.037
Okay. Thank you.

694
00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:14.073
Okay, so the Judge
lives in Aspian County.


695
00:39:14.075 --> 00:39:15.274
20 miles outside
city centre.


696
00:39:15.276 --> 00:39:16.876
We have two
cruisers there now.


697
00:39:16.878 --> 00:39:18.410
They found an open
Volvo wagon


698
00:39:18.412 --> 00:39:21.113
and a whole mess of groceries
spilled out onto the driveway.


699
00:39:21.115 --> 00:39:22.915
But we don't know
when it happened.


700
00:39:22.917 --> 00:39:24.183
So we're running
a check


701
00:39:24.185 --> 00:39:25.951
on all surveillance cameras
and any of the...


702
00:39:25.953 --> 00:39:26.952
Check the cash
register tape.


703
00:39:26.954 --> 00:39:28.187
What?

704
00:39:28.189 --> 00:39:29.822
In one of the bags
on the driveway.


705
00:39:29.824 --> 00:39:32.359
It'll tell us the store and
the time of purchase.


706
00:39:32.361 --> 00:39:35.027
If no tape, check the bags
or the price stickers


707
00:39:35.029 --> 00:39:37.863
to figure out which store,
go to the nearest one,


708
00:39:37.865 --> 00:39:40.267
<i>and get the time of purchase
from the manager.</i>


709
00:39:40.269 --> 00:39:45.205
The receipt will give us
where the Judge is.


710
00:39:45.207 --> 00:39:47.740
If the Judge bought his
groceries at 10 a.m.


711
00:39:47.742 --> 00:39:49.409
and this thing
went live at...


712
00:39:49.411 --> 00:39:51.244
1:11.

713
00:39:51.246 --> 00:39:53.880
<i>1:11, and a man can only drive
sixty five miles an hour</i>


714
00:39:53.882 --> 00:39:56.316
without attracting attention,
then the room they're in


715
00:39:56.318 --> 00:40:00.488
is no more than a hundred mile
radius from the Judge's house.


716
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:05.493
Now if we allow for fixing
up the room and picking up


717
00:40:05.495 --> 00:40:09.129
the other abductee, it's
probably even closer.


718
00:40:09.131 --> 00:40:11.132
What have you got
on the other one?


719
00:40:11.134 --> 00:40:13.334
We went back to the start
of the transmission


720
00:40:13.336 --> 00:40:15.536
and we figured out
it's a local. Ron Price.


721
00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:17.371
He owns and operates
Priced to Pleaze...


722
00:40:17.373 --> 00:40:18.940
<i>that's spelt
with a "Z".</i>


723
00:40:18.942 --> 00:40:21.142
Now he has an ex-wife
who's still his dispatcher.


724
00:40:21.144 --> 00:40:22.210
<i>She said
his first job this morning</i>


725
00:40:22.212 --> 00:40:24.979
<i>was out near Sheltenham.</i>

726
00:40:24.981 --> 00:40:29.984
So if our man picked up
Mr. Price after the judge,


727
00:40:29.986 --> 00:40:33.555
that means our location
is very local.


728
00:40:33.557 --> 00:40:36.525
Well it's patently clear
that you have thought


729
00:40:36.527 --> 00:40:40.828
this through thoroughly,
and intelligently...


730
00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:42.399
Don't condescend to me.

731
00:40:45.135 --> 00:40:50.138
...But you have made some
fundamental errors


732
00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.543
when it comes to
judicial process.


733
00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:58.513
You say you're going
to conduct a trial.


734
00:40:58.515 --> 00:41:00.382
You can't.

735
00:41:00.384 --> 00:41:02.017
A trial, a trial...

736
00:41:02.019 --> 00:41:04.086
"Is the examination of
evidence and applicable law


737
00:41:04.088 --> 00:41:05.588
by a competent tribunal
to determine


738
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:08.458
the specific issues of
charges and claims."


739
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.892
All right. All right. All right.

740
00:41:10.894 --> 00:41:15.431
Let's look at "applicable law
in a competent tribunal..."


741
00:41:15.433 --> 00:41:17.133
But we don't
have to.


742
00:41:17.135 --> 00:41:19.535
Because we already know
what law we're talking about.


743
00:41:19.537 --> 00:41:21.004
Premeditated murder.

744
00:41:21.006 --> 00:41:22.538
And as far as a competent
tribunal goes,


745
00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.274
well, I'm just
picking my jury


746
00:41:24.276 --> 00:41:26.476
from the same pot you
chose yours from.


747
00:41:26.478 --> 00:41:28.278
All that informs a
trial are rules.


748
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.313
<i>We'll have those.
And we'll have temperance.</i>


749
00:41:30.315 --> 00:41:32.015
<i>That makes
this a trial.</i>


750
00:41:32.017 --> 00:41:33.883
But we'll have something your
courtroom doesn't have,


751
00:41:33.885 --> 00:41:35.451
or doesn't have
very often.


752
00:41:35.453 --> 00:41:37.920
Which is?

753
00:41:37.922 --> 00:41:40.023
Justice.

754
00:41:40.025 --> 00:41:42.859
I will be the prosecutor and
you will be defending yourself.


755
00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:44.894
Out there will be the
judge and jury.


756
00:41:44.896 --> 00:41:46.297
The Judge speaks
in a trial.


757
00:41:46.299 --> 00:41:49.468
This Judge will speak.

758
00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.342
<i>TERRY: Holy Shit.</i>

759
00:42:01.514 --> 00:42:03.180
From the moment Claudine
Jeeter was taken


760
00:42:03.182 --> 00:42:04.649
<i>she was front
page news.</i>


761
00:42:04.651 --> 00:42:06.651
A fourteen year old girl,
straight A student,


762
00:42:06.653 --> 00:42:08.485
with a little pet terrier
named Brownie...


763
00:42:08.487 --> 00:42:10.655
plucked out of her world on
her way home from school.


764
00:42:10.657 --> 00:42:12.490
Everyone was gripped.

765
00:42:12.492 --> 00:42:15.360
<i>The public, the police,
the Judge to be. Everyone.</i>


766
00:42:15.362 --> 00:42:17.194
We all saw the Grandmother
Mrs. Solsza


767
00:42:17.196 --> 00:42:20.398
on our TV's practically every
night, as well as the cousin,


768
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.634
the family spokesman,
Bertinad Solsza.


769
00:42:22.636 --> 00:42:24.502
They became fixtures
in our living room,


770
00:42:24.504 --> 00:42:26.304
part of our
news, reality.


771
00:42:26.306 --> 00:42:28.373
As a result, the prosecution
will argue that the verdict


772
00:42:28.375 --> 00:42:30.275
in the Jeeter case was
manufactured instead


773
00:42:30.277 --> 00:42:31.943
of arrived at in
the courtroom.


774
00:42:31.945 --> 00:42:33.411
Not out of malice,

775
00:42:33.413 --> 00:42:35.213
but out of genuinely honest
outrage and desire.


776
00:42:35.215 --> 00:42:38.983
A desire to see someone pay for
the killing of young Claudine.


777
00:42:38.985 --> 00:42:42.020
But the prosecution will prove
that as a result of this desire


778
00:42:42.022 --> 00:42:43.622
there was a race to
the gallows.


779
00:42:43.624 --> 00:42:46.024
A race run on the fuel of
police incompetence


780
00:42:46.026 --> 00:42:47.526
and judicial corner-cutting,

781
00:42:47.528 --> 00:42:50.396
civil servants recreant
to their duty


782
00:42:50.398 --> 00:42:52.465
so an innocent man
was put to death.


783
00:42:52.467 --> 00:42:54.667
<i>Whether the state thought Paul
William Gager was guilty</i>


784
00:42:54.669 --> 00:42:56.369
<i>or not is not
the point.</i>


785
00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:58.504
<i>Does it matter if I thought
Ron the roofer</i>


786
00:42:58.506 --> 00:43:00.339
<i>was guilty of some
crime only later</i>


787
00:43:00.341 --> 00:43:02.341
<i>to discover that he wasn't?
Of course not.</i>


788
00:43:02.343 --> 00:43:04.510
<i>All that matters
is I killed him</i>

William Gager

<i>The prosecution will prove this

793
00:43:12.588 --> 00:43:15.187
by pointing out that his arrest
and trial was systematic


794
00:43:15.189 --> 00:43:18.492
of a justice system that
is ignorant, corrupt,


795
00:43:18.494 --> 00:43:20.261

796
00:43:24.166 --> 00:43:26.201
This is not how
it's done.

798
00:43:29.037 --> 00:43:30.604
No.

799
00:43:30.606 --> 00:43:32.372
Well you can only speak if
you're speaking as the defense.


800
00:43:32.374 --> 00:43:35.041
I can only speak as myself, I
can't speak as the defense.


801
00:43:35.043 --> 00:43:36.710
Then you don't have a
voice, unless it's as


802
00:43:36.712 --> 00:43:38.445
the defense addressing
the court.


803
00:43:38.447 --> 00:43:43.016
Because, as I have already
said, this is not a court.

Yes, this is your

819

The Jeeter case
was a capital case.

There is a
judge, yes.


821

But the verdict is reached
at by the jury,


822
00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:28.497
and they recommend
the sentence.


823
00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:32.401
The role of the magistrate
is considerably limited.

00:50:09.984 --> 00:50:11.717
<i>Any reasonable judge
would tell you...</i>


946
00:50:11.719 --> 00:50:14.520
No, we don't have to speculate
on what a reasonable judge


947
00:50:14.522 --> 00:50:16.422
would say, because
we have a judge.


948
00:50:16.424 --> 00:50:19.025
<i>And I don't think the judge
will say that my relationship</i>


949
00:50:19.027 --> 00:50:21.427
to Claudine excludes me
from trying this case,


950
00:50:21.429 --> 00:50:24.030
because the case at hand is
not about Claudine's abduction.


951
00:50:24.032 --> 00:50:27.934
It's about you putting an
innocent man to death.


952
00:50:27.936 --> 00:50:30.070
<i>That's the case
at trial here.</i>


953
00:50:30.072 --> 00:50:32.874
<i>So, I say we put it
to a judge's ruling.</i>


954
00:50:34.809 --> 00:50:36.609
That wouldn't stand
up anywhere.


955
00:50:36.611 --> 00:50:38.111
<i>TERRY: It will here.</i>

956
00:50:38.113 --> 00:50:40.113
It's not enough to just
surround the house.


957
00:50:40.115 --> 00:50:42.015
Someone has to
talk to the family.


958
00:50:42.017 --> 00:50:45.052
That's why I said
the cousin.


959
00:50:45.054 --> 00:50:46.820
Then let me talk
to them.


960
00:50:46.822 --> 00:50:47.888
His name is what?

961
00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:50.524
Bertinad, right?

962
00:50:50.526 --> 00:50:51.758
Then what is
the problem...


963
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.594
Lt. Elroy?

964
00:50:53.596 --> 00:50:55.529
Hi, Leonard Steptoe.

965
00:50:55.531 --> 00:50:58.532
<i>I was in charge of the
Jeeter investigation.</i>


966
00:50:58.534 --> 00:51:01.069
It looks like you've got
yourself in some situation, huh?


967
00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:03.804
I'm in the middle of a
nightmare, detective.


968
00:51:03.806 --> 00:51:06.007
I'm here to help you
any way I can.


969
00:51:06.009 --> 00:51:08.475
All right, now to start,
there's information


970
00:51:08.477 --> 00:51:11.680
about the Jeeter family
that you need to know.


971
00:51:15.218 --> 00:51:17.621
Come on, you
gotta be there.


972
00:51:21.725 --> 00:51:23.026
Oh shit.

973
00:51:24.861 --> 00:51:26.060
<i>STEPTOE: The uncle?</i>

974
00:51:26.062 --> 00:51:27.695
<i>He's dead.</i>

975
00:51:27.697 --> 00:51:29.231
Say again?

976
00:51:29.233 --> 00:51:31.699
His car slipped into the
Tremont Viaduct,


977
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:34.003
so whatever this freak
says he wants,


978
00:51:34.005 --> 00:51:36.871
it's not 'cause he's Claudine
Jeeter's uncle.


979
00:51:36.873 --> 00:51:38.673
<i>HARPER: And it looks
like, once again</i>


980
00:51:38.675 --> 00:51:40.708
<i>the objection is overruled.</i>

981
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:43.114
Your objection has
been overruled.


982
00:51:44.949 --> 00:51:47.716
I would like to know the
judge's reasoning.


983
00:51:47.718 --> 00:51:51.687
Do you always give a reason
when you're on the bench?


984
00:51:51.689 --> 00:51:53.689
<i>You've already accepted
one of the judge's rulings,</i>


985
00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:56.558
so that means you accept
the authority of this court.


986
00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.893
(DEEP SIGH)

987
00:51:57.895 --> 00:52:00.529
Let's be perfectly clear.

988
00:52:00.531 --> 00:52:05.000
The people who investigated and
tried the Jeeter case needed


989
00:52:05.002 --> 00:52:09.239
and wanted a crazed,
lone psychopath.


990
00:52:09.241 --> 00:52:11.674
<i>And they needed one for a
very simple reason.</i>


991
00:52:11.676 --> 00:52:13.276
See, the killing of
a young person


992
00:52:13.278 --> 00:52:15.511
is the worst crime that
we can imagine.


993
00:52:15.513 --> 00:52:20.516
In order to reconcile this
horror in our minds we need,


994
00:52:20.518 --> 00:52:24.621
we must have, and we must kill

995
00:52:24.623 --> 00:52:27.857
a crazed lone psychopath.

996
00:52:27.859 --> 00:52:32.662
Anybody who doesn't feel
that longing is inhuman.


997
00:52:32.664 --> 00:52:34.864
And it's written all
over this case.


998
00:52:34.866 --> 00:52:36.533
The lawyers, the police.

999
00:52:36.535 --> 00:52:38.635
And most of all the
justice system.


1000
00:52:38.637 --> 00:52:41.638
Every decision they made was
based on their humanity.


1001
00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.774
And because of the way that this
shitty system is set up


1002
00:52:44.776 --> 00:52:46.777
<i>they were allowed
to take the results</i>


1003
00:52:46.779 --> 00:52:49.680
of those flawed human
conclusions and couple that


1004
00:52:49.682 --> 00:52:52.549
with a power that really
doesn't belong to them.


1005
00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:55.488
The power to give
and take life.


1006
00:52:58.157 --> 00:53:00.224
You have something
to add?


1007
00:53:00.226 --> 00:53:03.194
Is that really what we're
talking about here?


1008
00:53:03.196 --> 00:53:07.064
The validity of the
death penalty?


1009
00:53:07.066 --> 00:53:10.735
I'm sorry, but for
whatever reason,


1010
00:53:10.737 --> 00:53:12.570
I thought this was
going to be


1011
00:53:12.572 --> 00:53:15.606
about something more
original and substantive.


1012
00:53:15.608 --> 00:53:17.175
Look around
you, Judge.


1013
00:53:17.177 --> 00:53:22.180
Do I strike you as someone who
isn't original and substantive?


1014
00:53:22.182 --> 00:53:23.917
<i>This is about justice.</i>

1015
00:53:25.986 --> 00:53:29.187
Now I want to question you about
the police work on this case.


1016
00:53:29.189 --> 00:53:30.989
I'm afraid I cannot
help you there.


1017
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:32.758
I am not a
policeman.


1018
00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.960
Well then I want to question you
about your interpretation


1019
00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:36.828
of the police work
on the case.


1020
00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:38.730
<i>Would you say that
it was thorough?</i>


1021
00:53:38.732 --> 00:53:41.134
<i>Up to the standards that
we expect from our police?</i>


1022
00:53:41.136 --> 00:53:42.901
Of course.

1023
00:53:42.903 --> 00:53:44.703
It would not have come to or
withstood trial otherwise.


1024
00:53:44.705 --> 00:53:46.372
<i>What would those
standards be?</i>


1025
00:53:46.374 --> 00:53:47.773
Isn't it true that most
serious crimes


1026
00:53:47.775 --> 00:53:49.708
in this country
go unsolved?


1027
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:51.244
By unsolved, you mean...

1028
00:53:51.246 --> 00:53:53.913
<i>I mean no bullshit myths,
no-no dime novels,</i>


1029
00:53:53.915 --> 00:53:56.916
no phony TV dramas.

1030
00:53:56.918 --> 00:53:59.685
Isn't it true that what most
real police officers investigate


1031
00:53:59.687 --> 00:54:01.821
in this country, they can't
and don't solve?


1032
00:54:01.823 --> 00:54:04.724
Isn't it true that only

1033
00:54:04.726 --> 00:54:07.994
of all non-violent crimes in
this country are solved?


1034
00:54:07.996 --> 00:54:08.995
<i>18 percent.</i>

1035
00:54:08.997 --> 00:54:10.730
Motherfucker.

1036
00:54:10.732 --> 00:54:12.632
And isn't it also true that
more than fifty percent


1037
00:54:12.634 --> 00:54:13.833
of violent crimes
go unsolved.


1038
00:54:13.835 --> 00:54:15.635
And nearly a third of
all murders...


1039
00:54:15.637 --> 00:54:17.237
That bears no relevance
to the Jeeter...


1040
00:54:17.239 --> 00:54:18.738
<i>Hell, the most
devastating murder</i>


1041
00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.307
<i>in the history
of this country</i>


1042
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:22.675
the assassination of a sitting
American President in full view


1043
00:54:22.677 --> 00:54:24.278
of the entire country
is still unsolved.


1044
00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.080
<i>The Zodiac killer, the
Lindbergh baby,</i>


1045
00:54:26.082 --> 00:54:30.884
Jon-Benet Ramsay, the Boston
Strangler, the list goes on.


1046
00:54:30.886 --> 00:54:34.354
Wouldn't it be stating fact to
say that as a standard


1047
00:54:34.356 --> 00:54:39.259
the police are unable to solve
most crimes in this country?


1048
00:54:39.261 --> 00:54:42.062
The Jeeter case
was rock solid.


1049
00:54:42.064 --> 00:54:45.268
There's not a person on this
planet that can prove otherwise.


1050
00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.808
<i>Can you tell me what
I'm pulling up here?</i>


1051
00:54:56.813 --> 00:54:59.781
You don't need me to tell
you, it's obvious.


1052
00:54:59.783 --> 00:55:01.282
Answer the question.

1053
00:55:01.284 --> 00:55:04.085
Well, they're
newspaper clippings.


1054
00:55:04.087 --> 00:55:06.921
Um... articles relating to
the Jeeter case.


1055
00:55:06.923 --> 00:55:09.891
Oh, you're familiar
with them?


1056
00:55:09.893 --> 00:55:11.329
Some of them, yes.

1057
00:55:12.863 --> 00:55:14.963
From the time
of the trial?


1058
00:55:14.965 --> 00:55:19.767
I presume so, yes.

1059
00:55:19.769 --> 00:55:24.772
Actually, those were all
from before the trial.


1060
00:55:24.774 --> 00:55:27.409
But-but you say that
they're familiar to you.


1061
00:55:27.411 --> 00:55:30.212
Could you go ahead and tell
the jury what's in them?


1062
00:55:30.214 --> 00:55:32.214
I'm not quite sure I
understand your question.


1063
00:55:32.216 --> 00:55:34.383
<i>That's okay. 
I'll answer.</i>

1064
00:55:34.385 --> 00:55:36.352
It's the story.

1065
00:55:36.354 --> 00:55:38.754
<i>The story of Paul William
Gager from the moment</i>


1066
00:55:38.756 --> 00:55:40.156
<i>that he was arrested.</i>

1067
00:55:40.158 --> 00:55:42.024
The loner living out
in the country.


1068
00:55:42.026 --> 00:55:43.826
Uncommunicative.

1069
00:55:43.828 --> 00:55:45.861
<i>He had that odd hobby
of metal detection.</i>


1070
00:55:45.863 --> 00:55:47.730
<i>That thing about building
the rabbit hutches</i>


1071
00:55:47.732 --> 00:55:49.765
<i>out of the roadside
construction signs.</i>


1072
00:55:49.767 --> 00:55:51.368
The knocking out of
the interior walls.


1073
00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:54.938
But most of all, that photo,
that high school photo.


1074
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.940
Is there a single person
in this country


1075
00:55:56.942 --> 00:55:59.376
that didn't find that
disturbing?


1076
00:55:59.378 --> 00:56:00.810
<i>You saw it, right?</i>

1077
00:56:00.812 --> 00:56:01.811
Yes.

1078
00:56:01.813 --> 00:56:04.247
<i>Hm, before the trial?</i>

1079
00:56:04.249 --> 00:56:06.149
Um... yes.

1080
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:07.150
Did you find
it disturbing?


1081
00:56:07.152 --> 00:56:09.085
I found it disturbing.

1082
00:56:09.087 --> 00:56:10.220
Yes.

1083
00:56:10.222 --> 00:56:11.489
Yes what?

1084
00:56:11.491 --> 00:56:13.857
Yes I found it
disturbing.


1085
00:56:13.859 --> 00:56:16.927
Well, I put it to you Judge,
that you saw that photo


1086
00:56:16.929 --> 00:56:19.330
and you put it together with
all those news stories


1087
00:56:19.332 --> 00:56:22.466
and all the evidence against him
just sorta clicked together.


1088
00:56:22.468 --> 00:56:24.268
<i>But, I mean we can't
forget about</i>


1089
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:25.869
the biggest piece of
evidence, right?


1090
00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:27.505
That she was found
on his property.


1091
00:56:27.507 --> 00:56:29.273
We can't forget
about that.


1092
00:56:29.275 --> 00:56:32.143
And that little link to the shed
by the side of the house.


1093
00:56:32.145 --> 00:56:33.778
<i>Boy that made sense.</i>

1094
00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.179
He was her killer.

1095
00:56:35.181 --> 00:56:37.048
That was the determination
of the jury.


1096
00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:38.916
Hm... working from
the facts.


1097
00:56:38.918 --> 00:56:40.484
<i>Yes.</i>

1098
00:56:40.486 --> 00:56:43.387
The facts that the police
provided to the prosecution.


1099
00:56:43.389 --> 00:56:44.822
Yes.

1100
00:56:44.824 --> 00:56:45.823
<i>But not all the
facts, right?</i>


1101
00:56:45.825 --> 00:56:47.225
What are you saying?

1102
00:56:47.227 --> 00:56:48.960
Well, isn't it true that the
jury never heard


1103
00:56:48.962 --> 00:56:50.429
about his previous
criminal history,


1104
00:56:50.431 --> 00:56:52.531
because you, the judge,
deemed it inadmissible?


1105
00:56:52.533 --> 00:56:54.366
<i>Yes, it's true.
I would not admit it.</i>


1106
00:56:54.368 --> 00:56:55.434
<i>Why?</i>

1107
00:56:55.436 --> 00:56:56.934
For his protection.

1108
00:56:56.936 --> 00:56:58.103
Because he had been
previously charged


1109
00:56:58.105 --> 00:57:00.239
with attempted
sexual abuse?


1110
00:57:00.241 --> 00:57:01.839
It would have
prejudiced the jury.


1111
00:57:01.841 --> 00:57:04.042
But it was sexual abuse
of a man, Judge.


1112
00:57:04.044 --> 00:57:05.379
Of a man.

1113
00:57:07.014 --> 00:57:09.815
<i>A 36 year old man who
he tried to pick up</i>


1114
00:57:09.817 --> 00:57:13.085
<i>at the Sapp Brothers
truck stop.</i>


1115
00:57:13.087 --> 00:57:15.988
(TYPING)

1116
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:18.090
Isn't it true that he
was also ordered


1117
00:57:18.092 --> 00:57:20.025
into a psychiatric
evaluation?


1118
00:57:20.027 --> 00:57:21.394
Not by me.

1119
00:57:21.396 --> 00:57:22.861
But the results of that
psychiatric evaluation


1120
00:57:22.863 --> 00:57:26.098
were also deemed inadmissible
by you, right?


1121
00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:28.201
<i>Well, help me out with
something here.</i>


1122
00:57:28.203 --> 00:57:31.304
<i>Would a homosexual man, who's
extremely claustrophobic...</i>


1123
00:57:31.306 --> 00:57:33.106
<i>so claustrophobic in
fact he knocked out</i>


1124
00:57:33.108 --> 00:57:34.907
<i>all the interior walls of
his house</i>


1125
00:57:34.909 --> 00:57:37.110
choose to keep a
fourteen year old girl


1126
00:57:37.112 --> 00:57:40.213
in a seven foot by five foot
shed with no windows?


1127
00:57:40.215 --> 00:57:41.881
<i>Because he must
have spent</i>


1128
00:57:41.883 --> 00:57:43.617
<i>a lot of time out there
with her, right?</i>


1129
00:57:43.619 --> 00:57:46.052
<i>I mean making all those
dolls and the necklaces</i>


1130
00:57:46.054 --> 00:57:47.320
<i>and the bracelets...</i>

1131
00:57:47.322 --> 00:57:49.055
So the size of the
shed is the issue?


1132
00:57:49.057 --> 00:57:51.291
The size of the shed
is not the issue...


1133
00:57:51.293 --> 00:57:52.859
No, on the contrary.

1134
00:57:52.861 --> 00:57:54.894
I think the size of the
shed is the issue.


1135
00:57:54.896 --> 00:57:57.897
No! The size of the shed
isn't the issue!


1136
00:57:57.899 --> 00:58:01.135
The issue is the court
supressing medical,


1137
00:58:01.137 --> 00:58:03.237
psychiatric, and criminal
evidence based


1138
00:58:03.239 --> 00:58:05.306
on their own God
damn personal bias.


1139
00:58:05.308 --> 00:58:08.075
No, that's almost
impossible to substantiate.


1140
00:58:08.077 --> 00:58:09.910
It may be impossible
to prove,


1141
00:58:09.912 --> 00:58:13.047
but it is possible that
it happened, right?


1142
00:58:13.049 --> 00:58:15.983
Maybe, yes, yes,
It's possible.


1143
00:58:15.985 --> 00:58:17.619
If there's anything
else he can say


1144
00:58:17.621 --> 00:58:22.524
or uncover, I'd like
to know now.

(TYPING)

1146
00:58:28.498 --> 00:58:31.232
Let me be
perfectly clear.


1147
00:58:31.234 --> 00:58:35.903
I dedicated two years of my
life to Claudine Jeeter.


1148
00:58:35.905 --> 00:58:38.139
I know I did
right by her.


1149
00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:41.076
So I don't have to take
questions from anyone.


1150
00:58:41.078 --> 00:58:42.243
Certainly not you.

1151
00:58:42.245 --> 00:58:43.244
Why not me?

1152
00:58:43.246 --> 00:58:44.479
Yeah, you made detective.

1153
00:58:44.481 --> 00:58:46.247
You traded it all
away for a desk.


1154
00:58:46.249 --> 00:58:47.683
You couldn't handle
the bad guys.


1155
00:58:47.685 --> 00:58:49.984
Now you're trading in your
desk for retirement.


1156
00:58:49.986 --> 00:58:52.921
You don't have any right to
question me or anyone else


1157
00:58:52.923 --> 00:58:56.024
about the leg work we
did on the Jeeter case.


1158
00:58:56.026 --> 00:58:58.294

the news media release</i>


1162

the size of the shed?</i>

<i>It's Darnley.</i>

1166
00:59:10.475 --> 00:59:12.341
<i>It's not online, okay?</i>

1167

<i>And in my world if it's not
online it doesn't exist.</i>

No one said it before.

1169
00:59:17.683 --> 00:59:20.116
Well, was there anything else
that was possibly suppressed


1170
00:59:20.118 --> 00:59:23.988
in order to guarantee a
conviction in this case?


1171

Wouldn't you be better able
to answer that than I would?

You're not her uncle.

I know who you are.

1174

You better see this.

1175

<i>Well if I am who
you think I am,</i>

<i>you really can't

<i>That's the bind.</i>

incriminating himself.

certain information,

who would know?

The perpetrator.

The person who
actually kidnapped


1189

and killed Claudine Jeeter.

1190
01:00:40.033 --> 01:00:43.168
Were they able to absolutely and

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:45.637
to Gager's backyard shed?

I'm asking you.

1194
01:00:53.247 --> 01:00:55.682
I heard the links to the shed
were circumstantial.


1195
01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:58.283
But they thought they were good
because they had him

dead to rights on nearly
everything else.


1197

<i>without incriminating

1201
01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:29.619
but here's how it might of
happened as these things go.


1202
01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:38.191
<i>He may have been
close to her.</i>


1203
01:01:38.193 --> 01:01:39.860
Close enough
that he saw her.


1204
01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:41.362
Not every day
but enough.


1205
01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.564
Enough to know how she
went about her life.


1206
01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:45.633
Walking to and from school
with her friends,


1207
01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.801
and playing with her
dog in the park,


1208
01:01:47.803 --> 01:01:51.205
and when she was forced to take
her brother to the corner store


1209
01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:53.207
and she hated it,
and you could tell.


1210
01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:55.309
Her arms and legs
in the summer.


1211
01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:57.779
The shade of
her skin.


1212
01:01:57.781 --> 01:02:00.381
She was a
pure thing.


1213
01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:04.184
Slowly he realized he wanted
to possess that purity.


1214
01:02:04.186 --> 01:02:05.487
Hold it.

1215
01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:07.889
Hold it in his hand
like a snowflake.


1216
01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:11.626
Protect it from
being sullied.


1217
01:02:11.628 --> 01:02:14.229
<i>And then eventually he realized
that he would take her.</i>


1218
01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:17.265
<i>He would take her and he
knew it was an awful thing.</i>


1219
01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.733
<i>A horrible
thing to do.</i>


1220
01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.402
<i>He wrestled with it.</i>

1221
01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:21.870
Can you imagine?

1222
01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:24.074
Wrestling with a
thing like that?


1223
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.343
<i>And then he
just took her.</i>


1224
01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:29.912
<i>In that one
simple act.</i>


1225
01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:32.280
Seconds really.

1226
01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:34.449
His whole life up until
then just shattered.


1227
01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:37.787
Like a... like a mirror
into a million pieces.


1228
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:42.758
But then he saw the
reaction of the news,


1229
01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.463
and the press, and the police,
and he was so relieved


1230
01:02:47.465 --> 01:02:49.699
<i>because he realized
he would be caught.</i>


1231
01:02:49.701 --> 01:02:50.700
<i>They would catch him.</i>

1232
01:02:50.702 --> 01:02:51.901
I mean, they
had to.


1233
01:02:51.903 --> 01:02:53.703
He always saw them
on television.


1234
01:02:53.705 --> 01:02:56.305
They were always saying that
they were getting the job done.


1235
01:02:56.307 --> 01:02:57.673
Working day
and night.


1236
01:02:57.675 --> 01:02:59.475
They wouldn't rest until
they found the killer.


1237
01:02:59.477 --> 01:03:02.678
But day after day went by, and
day after day he wasn't caught,


1238
01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.447
he wasn't captured.

1239
01:03:04.449 --> 01:03:06.683
And he came to realize that he
was not going to be caught,


1240
01:03:06.685 --> 01:03:09.586
<i>and the reason for
that was this:</i>


1241
01:03:09.588 --> 01:03:12.221
They didn't know what
they were doing.


1242
01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:14.591
<i>Sure they looked like police,
but they weren't.</i>


1243
01:03:14.593 --> 01:03:16.225
<i>Not really.</i>

1244
01:03:16.227 --> 01:03:17.661
<i>Day after day, they
waved him through</i>


1245
01:03:17.663 --> 01:03:19.429
<i>their preliminary
check points,</i>


1246
01:03:19.431 --> 01:03:22.499
and day after day he could
breathe less and less and less.


1247
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:25.502
Now it might have been that the
abductor began to test things.


1248
01:03:25.504 --> 01:03:27.337
The first time that they
questioned him


1249
01:03:27.339 --> 01:03:28.705
he gave them
two clues.


1250
01:03:28.707 --> 01:03:32.309
Now, they weren't easy,
but they weren't hard.


1251
01:03:32.311 --> 01:03:33.845
Nothing came of it.

1252
01:03:33.847 --> 01:03:35.512
<i>So the next time
he made it easier.</i>


1253
01:03:35.514 --> 01:03:37.247
<i>Obvious even.</i>

1254
01:03:37.249 --> 01:03:38.950
Didn't matter, they didn't
follow up on that either.


1255
01:03:38.952 --> 01:03:41.485
So finally he mailed in an
anonymous confession.


1256
01:03:41.487 --> 01:03:43.988
He even included some
of his own DNA.


1257
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:45.990
But the police lost it.

1258
01:03:45.992 --> 01:03:48.258
<i>Now if you can
believe this:</i>


1259
01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:50.962
They were actually in the yard
where she was being kept.


1260
01:03:50.964 --> 01:03:52.697
They were right there.

1261
01:03:52.699 --> 01:03:54.966
All they had to do was walk the
three extra feet but...


1262
01:03:54.968 --> 01:03:57.368
<i>gosh they just couldn't
bring themselves to do it.</i>


1263
01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:59.404
<i>They would have found
her if they had.</i>


1264
01:03:59.406 --> 01:04:01.639
<i>And once he realized
how lousy it all was,</i>


1265
01:04:01.641 --> 01:04:02.841
<i>that the conclusion
was inevitable.</i>


1266
01:04:02.843 --> 01:04:04.442
He would have
to kill her.


1267
01:04:04.444 --> 01:04:06.244
He would have to
kill the girl.


1268
01:04:06.246 --> 01:04:08.847
That would be the only way
that they could catch him.


1269
01:04:08.849 --> 01:04:11.482
Once they had the body, once
they had the evidence


1270
01:04:11.484 --> 01:04:13.284
then they would
need to catch him.


1271
01:04:13.286 --> 01:04:15.921
And once they caught him they
would put him to death


1272
01:04:15.923 --> 01:04:17.523
because that's the only
thing that should happen


1273
01:04:17.525 --> 01:04:18.924
to somebody like him.

1274
01:04:18.926 --> 01:04:21.560
Someone like him that
would do a thing like that


1275
01:04:21.562 --> 01:04:24.532
<i>to somebody like her
deserves to die.</i>


1276
01:04:26.701 --> 01:04:29.401
So he killed her, and once
he began to reckon


1277
01:04:29.403 --> 01:04:32.705
with the real moral realities
of the situation,


1278
01:04:32.707 --> 01:04:34.506
<i>he tipped off
the police.</i>


1279
01:04:34.508 --> 01:04:36.542
The police came and they
collected the body,


1280
01:04:36.544 --> 01:04:38.343
and they collected
the evidence,


1281
01:04:38.345 --> 01:04:40.279
and after that they got
everything wrong.


1282
01:04:40.281 --> 01:04:41.815
<i>They accused Paul
William Gager.</i>


1283
01:04:41.817 --> 01:04:44.551
Paul William Gager, just because
she was on his property.


1284
01:04:44.553 --> 01:04:46.052
And because of the
rabbit hutch's


1285
01:04:46.054 --> 01:04:47.954
made out of
construction signs.


1286
01:04:47.956 --> 01:04:51.891
And of course that
God damn photo.


1287
01:04:51.893 --> 01:04:54.594
And that's what the
cable news ran with.


1288
01:04:54.596 --> 01:04:57.297
<i>That-that photo for
four days straight.</i>


1289
01:04:57.299 --> 01:04:59.466
<i>Every headline.</i>

1290
01:04:59.468 --> 01:05:00.834
<i>And by the time they
were finished with him,</i>


1291
01:05:00.836 --> 01:05:02.335
<i>the whole country
knew that he did it.</i>


1292
01:05:02.337 --> 01:05:04.637
The trial, that was
only a formality.


1293
01:05:04.639 --> 01:05:09.644
All that was left was for you to
preside over the execution.


1294
01:05:11.047 --> 01:05:13.080
<i>Yes.</i>

1295
01:05:13.082 --> 01:05:17.885
I am the prosecution's final and
most irrefutable proof


1296
01:05:17.887 --> 01:05:20.923
<i>that you killed an
innocent man.</i>


1297
01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:29.930
I killed Claudine Jeeter.

1298
01:05:29.932 --> 01:05:31.031
<i>There's not a single
thing you can do</i>


1299
01:05:31.033 --> 01:05:33.369
<i>that can make
that not so.</i>


1300
01:05:38.374 --> 01:05:40.676
(LOUD CHATTER)

1301
01:05:52.623 --> 01:05:56.792
I understand how you have
come to the conclusions


1302
01:05:56.794 --> 01:05:59.828
that you've come to.

1303
01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:04.366
But... You have
to remember...


1304
01:06:04.368 --> 01:06:09.105
that the law is administered
by people.


1305
01:06:09.107 --> 01:06:13.610
And people are
not perfect.


1306
01:06:14.779 --> 01:06:16.680
<i>That's not the issue.</i>

1307
01:06:18.515 --> 01:06:21.984
We both know that
that's not the issue.


1308
01:06:21.986 --> 01:06:26.991
The issue is... what is to
be done with me?


1309
01:06:32.163 --> 01:06:36.032
Well... if there were
a trial...


1310
01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:39.001
<i>Well, I think we can get
through a trial pretty quickly.</i>


1311
01:06:39.003 --> 01:06:41.871
I'm saying
that I did it.


1312
01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:45.508
I mean I've got all the
proof to back it up.


1313
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:49.480
I'd say I've got rock solid
guilt coming and going.


1314
01:06:51.884 --> 01:06:54.184
There's the question
of intent.


1315
01:06:54.186 --> 01:06:55.953
Let's talk about intent.

1316
01:06:55.955 --> 01:06:58.622
Was it your intention when you
first entered that courtroom on


1317
01:06:58.624 --> 01:07:01.758
the very first day to see
Claudine Jeeter's killer


1318
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.598
put to death if the jury
found him guilty?


1319
01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:12.471
I believed what
they told me.


1320
01:07:19.478 --> 01:07:21.145
There isn't a single
person out there


1321
01:07:21.147 --> 01:07:22.947
who isn't going to
vote to convict.


1322
01:07:22.949 --> 01:07:26.017
And when that happens I will
own the story one way or...


1323
01:07:26.019 --> 01:07:27.585
<i>Carl...</i>

1324
01:07:27.587 --> 01:07:28.620
<i>Carl!</i>

1325
01:07:28.622 --> 01:07:30.056
<i>Shit.</i>

1326
01:07:39.799 --> 01:07:41.501
I need to talk
to you.


1327
01:07:42.903 --> 01:07:44.903
Harper.

1328
01:07:44.905 --> 01:07:46.604
Why did you float
that crap


1329
01:07:46.606 --> 01:07:49.108
<i>about people questioning
the judge?</i>


1330
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:53.147
And all that shit
about the verdict?


1331
01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.819
Kaitlyn, listen to me.

1332
01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:04.657
The story will be
forgotten tomorrow.


1333
01:08:04.659 --> 01:08:06.427
But not who told it.

1334
01:08:10.698 --> 01:08:12.564
STEPTOE: You don't get the
urgency of this?


1335
01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:14.200
We're watching it
on television.


1336
01:08:14.202 --> 01:08:16.102
I mean, bring that to the
commissioner's office...


1337
01:08:16.104 --> 01:08:17.971
What are you doing?

1338
01:08:17.973 --> 01:08:20.506
I'm getting authorization to
take over this whole thing.


1339
01:08:20.508 --> 01:08:22.574
All right, technically it's
not just a homicide,


1340
01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:24.780
it's part of the
Jeeter case, and...


1341
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:27.948
Come on.

1342
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:29.082
Look, we both know
they are gonna


1343
01:08:29.084 --> 01:08:30.917
want me to take this over now.

1344
01:08:30.919 --> 01:08:33.186
Oh yeah.

1345
01:08:33.188 --> 01:08:34.690
I believe that.

1346
01:08:36.758 --> 01:08:39.826
You know the new
building is finally ready?


1347
01:08:39.828 --> 01:08:41.895
And I'm not gonna
make it in there.


1348
01:08:41.897 --> 01:08:44.130
37 years on
the force


1349
01:08:44.132 --> 01:08:48.902
and it will all have been
spent in this rat hole.


1350
01:08:48.904 --> 01:08:51.105
This precinct was famous.

1351
01:08:51.107 --> 01:08:54.774
Did you know this building
is 120 years old?


1352
01:08:54.776 --> 01:08:56.643
They redid it
in 1960,


1353
01:08:56.645 --> 01:08:59.983
but it was the original
HQ for all of Metro.


1354
01:09:02.018 --> 01:09:03.684
Remember Frank Stoppard?

1355
01:09:03.686 --> 01:09:05.252
Oh yeah.

1356
01:09:05.254 --> 01:09:07.588
Every night he'd be on TV
talking to the press about,


1357
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:08.856
"We're investigating this."

1358
01:09:08.858 --> 01:09:11.692
And "we're
investigating that."


1359
01:09:11.694 --> 01:09:15.129
'Cause you know,
the 70's were bad.


1360
01:09:15.131 --> 01:09:16.164
They sure were.

1361
01:09:16.166 --> 01:09:18.100
Violent.

1362
01:09:18.102 --> 01:09:21.036
But no matter how
ugly it was,


1363
01:09:21.038 --> 01:09:24.906
you just felt better
looking at Frank.


1364
01:09:24.908 --> 01:09:28.709
He looked... right.

1365
01:09:28.711 --> 01:09:29.911
<i>A touch of gray.</i>

1366
01:09:29.913 --> 01:09:31.813
<i>Always wore the
right suite.</i>


1367
01:09:31.815 --> 01:09:33.917
<i>All the other guys
were slobs.</i>


1368
01:09:35.986 --> 01:09:37.819
Then I realized they
looked like that


1369
01:09:37.821 --> 01:09:42.791
because they spent their lives
knocking on doors.


1370
01:09:42.793 --> 01:09:47.062
Been working the phones,
and chasing down leads.


1371
01:09:47.064 --> 01:09:48.830
<i>Frank was just
a front man.</i>


1372
01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:49.931
<i>They all knew it.</i>

1373
01:09:49.933 --> 01:09:51.535
Including Frank.

1374
01:09:52.903 --> 01:09:57.876
Today... everyone's
a Frank.


1375
01:09:59.811 --> 01:10:03.612
I didn't take a desk because
I couldn't stand the heat.


1376
01:10:03.614 --> 01:10:06.949
I took a desk because I
saw it all coming apart.


1377
01:10:06.951 --> 01:10:08.751
And I wanted to
do something


1378
01:10:08.753 --> 01:10:11.089
that at least felt like
real police work.


1379
01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.231
But this... Terrible
as it is...


1380
01:10:24.236 --> 01:10:27.670
<i>Let's start with one
simple question:</i>


1381
01:10:27.672 --> 01:10:30.174
Were there marks on her
wrists and neck?


1382
01:10:30.176 --> 01:10:31.707
Yes.

1383
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:33.377
What did Stapleton
say about that?


1384
01:10:33.379 --> 01:10:34.778
Stapleton didn't do
the post mortem.


1385
01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:36.246
It's all in
the reports.


1386
01:10:36.248 --> 01:10:37.781
<i>We had Baker do
the post mortem...</i>


1387
01:10:37.783 --> 01:10:40.017
Stapleton's got 40
years with homicide.


1388
01:10:40.019 --> 01:10:41.752
Yes, I know that.

1389
01:10:41.754 --> 01:10:43.087
An experienced pathologist
would have made something


1390
01:10:43.089 --> 01:10:44.655
of the marks...

1391
01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:46.223
<i>We wanted to pick
up Gager anyway.</i>


1392
01:10:46.225 --> 01:10:48.826
Our hero here, just told us the
two of them made bracelets


1393
01:10:48.828 --> 01:10:50.395
and necklaces together.

1394
01:10:50.397 --> 01:10:52.663
If he knows that
and it's a match,


1395
01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.898
then he's our guy,
and he's close by.


1396
01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.070
That's a very big
reach Lieutenant.


1397
01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:00.838
He told us.

1398
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.242
"Walking with her friends
back and forth from school...


1399
01:11:04.244 --> 01:11:05.844
<i>The trips to the
corner store...</i>


1400
