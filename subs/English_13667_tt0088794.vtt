<b>*** Subtitles created by dylux ***</b>

2
00:04:25.158 --> 00:04:26.409
You missed!

3
00:04:26.577 --> 00:04:29.996
You missed this time,
you little...


4
00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:31.622
menace!

5
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.124
I beat you!

6
00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:37.670
Morning.

7
00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:53.894
Now, honey, you're getting
all upset over nothing.


8
00:04:54.062 --> 00:04:55.187
I'm not--

9
00:04:55.355 --> 00:04:59.692
Here, a nice breakfast
will cheer you up.


10
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.822
I am not getting upset over--

11
00:05:05.574 --> 00:05:09.327
- What is that?
- It's bacon.


12
00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:12.747
I know it's bacon, honey.

13
00:05:12.914 --> 00:05:15.207
What have you done to it?

14
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:20.713
You said you didn't like all the grease
from fried bacon, so I boiled it.


15
00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:31.265
What is Lane doing up at
this hour on a Sunday?


16
00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:34.435
Doesn't he turn to dust or something
if the sun hits him before noon?


17
00:05:34.603 --> 00:05:37.188
Oh, he has tryouts for the
high-school ski team.


18
00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:39.565
He's going up to Mount Brodie with Beth.

19
00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:41.400
Oh, sure, he's going up with Beth.

20
00:05:41.568 --> 00:05:43.569
He can't do anything
without that girl.


21
00:05:43.737 --> 00:05:47.198
I tell you, Jenny,
that boy is obsessed.


22
00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:49.325
Now, honey...

23
00:05:49.868 --> 00:05:51.118
Obsessed?

24
00:06:03.632 --> 00:06:05.508
Do we not throw things away
when they're empty?


25
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.470
Oh.

26
00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:31.325
What in the name of all that's holy--?

27
00:06:31.493 --> 00:06:35.788
Badger likes the prizes you can get from
cutting the coupons from the boxes.


28
00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:37.748
He's mailing them today.

29
00:06:37.916 --> 00:06:40.251
Can't you wait until the--?

30
00:06:50.637 --> 00:06:55.474
Lane, a closet door can be closed
as well as it can be opened.


31
00:06:55.642 --> 00:06:58.269
- Ooh! Freak.
- Sorry, Dad.


32
00:06:58.437 --> 00:07:01.355
Lane, dear, your breakfast
is getting cold.


33
00:07:01.523 --> 00:07:03.441
No, thanks, Mom.

34
00:07:03.608 --> 00:07:05.818
I can't have breakfast today,
Mom, I got tryouts today.


35
00:07:05.986 --> 00:07:07.027
I got a nervous stomach.

36
00:07:07.195 --> 00:07:10.698
Don't wanna throw up from the chair lift.
Had to buy that guy a new hat last time.


37
00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:12.575
Bye, Dad.

38
00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:15.703
Lane, Lane.

39
00:07:15.871 --> 00:07:17.204
Memorandum.

40
00:07:17.372 --> 00:07:19.498
I would like to take a meeting
with you tonight


41
00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:21.709
to discuss the future
of that vehicle,


42
00:07:21.877 --> 00:07:23.669
which you purchased
several months ago,


43
00:07:23.837 --> 00:07:26.005
yet has darkened our driveway,

44
00:07:26.173 --> 00:07:27.465
immobile ever since.

45
00:07:27.632 --> 00:07:29.258
Okay, Dad. Noted.

46
00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:31.552
Talk to you tonight.
I gotta go pick up Beth.


47
00:08:00.832 --> 00:08:03.083
Ricky. Ricky, Ricky.

48
00:08:07.088 --> 00:08:08.130
Ricky.

49
00:08:08.298 --> 00:08:12.009
Ricky. Don't be so shy.
Come here.


50
00:08:14.888 --> 00:08:20.476
Uh, Monique, this is Ricky.

51
00:08:20.644 --> 00:08:23.270
Ricky, this is Monique.

52
00:08:23.438 --> 00:08:27.483
The French foreign-exchange student
who'll be staying with us.


53
00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:48.921
Ah!

54
00:08:50.257 --> 00:08:52.550
It's an awesome spectacle.

55
00:08:52.717 --> 00:08:56.178
An audacious display
of seething opponents.


56
00:08:56.346 --> 00:08:58.305
Once again, parallel

57
00:08:58.473 --> 00:09:03.394
in an obstinate attempt to prove
superiority of the roads,


58
00:09:03.562 --> 00:09:06.647
unequaled in our lifetime.

59
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:12.152
The crowds swell with anticipation
as the lights turn green.


60
00:09:22.205 --> 00:09:23.414
You stupid bonehead.

61
00:09:23.582 --> 00:09:25.666
- I'm gonna activate your dental--
- I'm so sorry.


62
00:09:25.834 --> 00:09:27.835
- You idiot. Get out of this car.
- Sorry.


63
00:09:28.003 --> 00:09:29.211
- Get out of this car.
- Aah!


64
00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:32.131
If he asks me out, of course
I'm gonna go out with him.


65
00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:34.842
I mean, he skis the K-12.

66
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.095
Yeah, he's so boss.

67
00:09:38.263 --> 00:09:39.805
Lane?

68
00:09:40.098 --> 00:09:41.473
Oh, no, I'll tell him after tryouts

69
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:43.642
because you know how he gets
when he gets upset.


70
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.102
Yeah.

71
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:46.520
From the chair lift.

72
00:09:46.688 --> 00:09:48.647
He had to buy the guy
a new hat last time.


73
00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:54.194
Oh, look, Lane's here. I gotta go, okay?
I'll call you later. Bye.


74
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:29.897
I hear he's the only
person in Greendale


75
00:10:30.065 --> 00:10:33.692
that's ever skied the K-12
from the glacier and lived.


76
00:10:56.591 --> 00:11:00.260
Man, what a hunk.

77
00:11:11.231 --> 00:11:15.359
Okay, listen up, your running
time has to be under 58 seconds


78
00:11:15.527 --> 00:11:16.986
to even be considered for the team.

79
00:11:17.153 --> 00:11:21.949
Your time will be gauged along with
a rating of one to ten on your style,


80
00:11:22.117 --> 00:11:26.996
which will be judged solely by me and
my vast expertise of skiing technique.


81
00:11:27.163 --> 00:11:30.207
So why don't we have you
sorry-looking lot of hopefuls


82
00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:31.709
make your way up the hill?

83
00:11:31.876 --> 00:11:34.420
Now, you, uh, future members
of the girls ski team


84
00:11:34.587 --> 00:11:37.423
can all keep me company until it's
time for you to take the track.


85
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.759
Who'd like to, um,
hold my clipboard?


86
00:11:42.762 --> 00:11:45.305
Oh, you'll make a fine little helper.
What's your name?


87
00:11:45.473 --> 00:11:46.765
Charles de Mar.

88
00:11:47.976 --> 00:11:49.101
Shut up, geek.

89
00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:53.689
- What's your name?
- Beth.


90
00:11:54.107 --> 00:11:55.649
That's my favorite name.

91
00:11:58.486 --> 00:12:00.529
<i>Ð’uenas dias,</i> Roy Stalin.
How you doing?


92
00:12:00.697 --> 00:12:01.905
<i>Hola,</i> Lane Myer.

93
00:12:02.073 --> 00:12:04.825
I can see you and I share, uh,
one common desire.


94
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:09.079
The desire to be a part of
the well-oiled machinery


95
00:12:09.247 --> 00:12:11.915
that is the Greendale High
School ski racing team.


96
00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:14.668
- The desire for victory.
- Well, I--


97
00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:16.879
Right on. Get up there,
let's see what you've got.


98
00:12:26.222 --> 00:12:29.349
- Okay, ready up there?
- Yeah, we're all set.


99
00:12:29.517 --> 00:12:31.477
What is the next victim's name?

100
00:12:31.644 --> 00:12:33.937
Uh, Myer. Lane Myer.

101
00:12:34.105 --> 00:12:38.609
- Myer? Is that as in Oscar Mayer?
- That's a roger, dude.


102
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:41.195
Beth, you were standing with Oscar.

103
00:12:41.362 --> 00:12:44.907
Is he your, uh, main wiener man?

104
00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:47.159
Don't listen to Stalin, kid.

105
00:12:47.327 --> 00:12:48.577
He's a punk.

106
00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:50.454
Now, you show him, Rock.

107
00:12:50.622 --> 00:12:53.540
You show him how a skier really skis.

108
00:12:53.708 --> 00:12:55.042
Okay, we're sending him down.

109
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.211
Well, that's a roger.
Counting down.


110
00:12:59.798 --> 00:13:00.964
Go.

111
00:13:27.325 --> 00:13:28.575
Oh, too bad.

112
00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:31.495
Real close. Next.

113
00:13:31.663 --> 00:13:34.706
Listen, Lane, I think we should talk.

114
00:13:34.874 --> 00:13:36.875
We've been seeing an awful lot
of each other lately


115
00:13:37.043 --> 00:13:38.961
and I really think it's
in my best interest


116
00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:41.421
if I went out with
someone more popular.


117
00:13:41.589 --> 00:13:45.050
Better looking, drives a nicer car.

118
00:13:47.887 --> 00:13:49.096
Six months.

119
00:13:49.264 --> 00:13:52.558
Six months and she
just dumps me for him.

120
00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:54.935
For Stalin, just like that.

121
00:13:55.103 --> 00:13:57.855
Six stinking months.

122
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:06.029
Truly a sight to behold.

123
00:14:06.197 --> 00:14:07.865
A man, beaten.

124
00:14:08.032 --> 00:14:09.950
The once great champ

125
00:14:10.118 --> 00:14:13.745
now a study in mopishness.

126
00:14:13.913 --> 00:14:16.999
- No longer the victory-hungry stallion
- All right.


127
00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:20.043
we've raced so many times before.

128
00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:25.007
But a pathetic, washed-up,
aged ex-champion.


129
00:14:25.175 --> 00:14:26.383
All right, let's go.

130
00:14:32.974 --> 00:14:35.225
Somebody's gonna see God.

131
00:14:38.104 --> 00:14:39.855
I'm gonna break your goddamn neck.

132
00:14:40.023 --> 00:14:42.065
Get out of the car.

133
00:14:42.233 --> 00:14:44.985
Get-
- Get out of the car.

134
00:14:49.282 --> 00:14:50.449
Hello, Lane.

135
00:14:50.617 --> 00:14:53.035
- How was your day?
- Beth broke up with me.


136
00:14:53.203 --> 00:14:55.370
Oh, heh, that's nice.

137
00:14:55.538 --> 00:14:57.956
We're through. That's it.

138
00:15:12.055 --> 00:15:13.347
What the hell?

139
00:15:13.514 --> 00:15:15.432
Wait a minute here.

140
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.143
Wait, this is death here.

141
00:15:19.854 --> 00:15:22.064
I haven't even been
to New York City.


142
00:15:22.232 --> 00:15:24.775
Jesus, I haven't even been anywhere.

143
00:15:35.286 --> 00:15:38.622
Suicide is never the answer,
little trooper.


144
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:42.459
Greendale is a bodaciously
small town, Lane.


145
00:15:42.627 --> 00:15:44.711
It's a fly speck on the map.

146
00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:46.922
A rest stop on the
way to a ski slope.

147
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.758
I can't even get real drugs here.

148
00:15:50.802 --> 00:15:52.094
Stalin's a hero.

149
00:15:52.262 --> 00:15:55.097
The only one in this town
who can ski the K-12.


150
00:15:55.265 --> 00:15:58.350
Now, you're a great skier, Lane,
but he's incredible.


151
00:15:59.477 --> 00:16:00.852
What if I ski the K-12?

152
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.105
You think she'd take me back?

153
00:16:05.692 --> 00:16:08.151
Now back to suicide again.

154
00:16:13.449 --> 00:16:16.451
I think we're all going
to enjoy this little treat.


155
00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:19.329
I got the recipe from the
Ladies' Home Journal.


156
00:16:19.497 --> 00:16:22.708
The mail got wet in the rain, so
some of the pages ran together.


157
00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:26.670
But what I couldn't read, I just improvised
with my own little creative ideas.


158
00:16:26.838 --> 00:16:31.508
You see, it's got, uh,
raisins in it. Heh.


159
00:16:31.676 --> 00:16:33.969
You like raisins.

160
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.350
There is still one more thing
I would like to discuss with Lane.


161
00:16:40.852 --> 00:16:43.186
The subject...

162
00:16:45.523 --> 00:16:48.900
...is the mystery car.

163
00:16:49.902 --> 00:16:51.528
Thank you, honey.

164
00:16:52.947 --> 00:16:55.449
Which, even as we speak,

165
00:16:55.616 --> 00:16:58.452
darkens our domain under a moldy tarp.

166
00:16:58.619 --> 00:17:01.079
You do know the
car of which I speak?

167
00:17:01.247 --> 00:17:03.623
- Yeah, I just never--
- Let me refresh your memory.


168
00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:05.834
Cast your mind back.

169
00:17:06.002 --> 00:17:08.253
It's a crisp September morning.

170
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:12.424
You borrowed $200 from me
to purchase the car.


171
00:17:12.592 --> 00:17:18.430
Mainly because your girlfriend, Beth,
said it was... I believe the term was "tasty."


172
00:17:18.848 --> 00:17:25.771
Since then, that tasty car has slept
in an auto cocoon on my front lawn.


173
00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:28.940
I'll get around to it.

174
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:33.111
Lane, have you seen the
new exchange student


175
00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:34.738
who's staying at the Smiths' house?

176
00:17:34.906 --> 00:17:37.074
Perhaps you should go over
and welcome her to our town.


177
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:38.909
I think that she would like that.

178
00:17:39.077 --> 00:17:41.244
Mrs. Smith probably got her
so that weirdo son of theirs


179
00:17:42.038 --> 00:17:43.914
could see what
a real girl looks like.


180
00:17:44.082 --> 00:17:47.000
You know, he never goes outdoors.

181
00:17:47.168 --> 00:17:49.961
Just sits in that house,
crochets all day long.


182
00:17:50.129 --> 00:17:53.590
The Chapmans had their exchange
student stay with them for six months.


183
00:17:53.758 --> 00:17:56.593
He practically became a
son to Jules and Irene.


184
00:17:56.761 --> 00:17:58.553
You mean that kid from El Salvador?

185
00:17:59.055 --> 00:18:01.973
Can I be excused? 
I'm not feeling well.

186
00:18:02.266 --> 00:18:04.726
I'm just gonna be excused.

187
00:18:16.656 --> 00:18:19.199
I can't figure it out, Badger.

188
00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:23.453
I mean, you seem like a smart kid, why do
you waste time with kid-stuff garbage?


189
00:18:27.166 --> 00:18:29.209
You're almost 8.

190
00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:37.134
Okay.

191
00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:48.353
Beth,

192
00:18:48.521 --> 00:18:50.772
it was love at first sight.

193
00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.449
Red Dog, Red Dog, 92, 74, 16, 43.

194
00:19:00.616 --> 00:19:03.118
Bring it home, Mama.

195
00:19:09.459 --> 00:19:11.918
Hey, Dan, Dan.
Got it. Got it.


196
00:19:32.565 --> 00:19:37.068
- Hi.
- Hi.


197
00:19:39.614 --> 00:19:42.115
So, uh, how do you like Greendale?

198
00:19:42.533 --> 00:19:44.242
Fine. Heh-heh-heh.

199
00:19:45.077 --> 00:19:49.789
Uh, and the school system,
you find it, uh, adequate?


200
00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:52.792
- School hasn't started yet.
- Oh.


201
00:19:53.753 --> 00:19:55.170
<i>She itched her nose.</i>

202
00:19:55.338 --> 00:19:57.422
<i>I wonder if that was some
unconscious message to me</i>


203
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.007
<i>that there's something
on mÑƒ nose.</i>


204
00:19:59.175 --> 00:20:01.343
<i>That's funny. He wiped
his nose after I did.</i>


205
00:20:01.511 --> 00:20:02.886
I don't like school that much.

206
00:20:03.054 --> 00:20:05.764
<i>Maybe I got some dirt
on my nose when I itched it.</i>


207
00:20:05.932 --> 00:20:09.809
<i>God, he's too embarrassed to tell me.
I must look sickening.</i>


208
00:20:09.977 --> 00:20:11.436
I don't know.

209
00:20:11.604 --> 00:20:16.316
<i>There she goes again. What could it be?
Dirt? Relish? Relish on my nose?</i>


210
00:20:16.484 --> 00:20:19.736
<i>How gross. She might think it's a--
Oh, not that.</i>


211
00:20:19.904 --> 00:20:22.322
<i>Oh, no, please.
Please don't let it be a booger.</i>


212
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.950
<i>Not now. Please, God.</i>

213
00:20:33.084 --> 00:20:34.668
<i>Oh, man.</i>

214
00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:50.767
I don't get it.
How could--?


215
00:20:51.102 --> 00:20:54.354
How could she throw away six months?

216
00:20:54.522 --> 00:20:57.023
I mean, six months?

217
00:20:57.191 --> 00:20:59.234
Just like that?

218
00:21:00.111 --> 00:21:02.487
No explanation, no reason.

219
00:21:02.655 --> 00:21:03.989
Just--

220
00:21:04.156 --> 00:21:05.865
Just throw it away.

221
00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:07.450
Doesn't--

222
00:21:07.618 --> 00:21:11.621
How can you throw away six months
when you're in love with someone?


223
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:13.206
I mean,

224
00:21:13.624 --> 00:21:15.375
six months is just--

225
00:21:15.543 --> 00:21:19.337
I'm history. Just, bam,
like that, I'm gone.


226
00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:22.424
She-
- Probably just testing me.

227
00:21:22.592 --> 00:21:24.676
A big test. That's probably--

228
00:21:26.721 --> 00:21:30.515
That's her.

229
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:36.104
Johnny.

230
00:21:36.439 --> 00:21:38.273
Four weeks.

231
00:21:38.441 --> 00:21:42.777
Twenty papers, that's two dollars...
plus tip.


232
00:21:42.945 --> 00:21:45.030
Gee, Johnny, I don't have a dime.
Sorry.


233
00:21:46.032 --> 00:21:47.324
Didn't ask for a dime.

234
00:21:48.618 --> 00:21:50.744
Two dollars.

235
00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:52.746
Well, ah, it's funny.

236
00:21:52.913 --> 00:21:55.790
See, my mom had to leave early
to take my brother to school


237
00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:57.125
and my dad to work, because--

238
00:21:57.293 --> 00:22:00.503
Two dollars, cash.

239
00:22:00.671 --> 00:22:03.673
You see, the problem here is that
my little brother, this morning,


240
00:22:03.841 --> 00:22:05.675
he got his arm caught
in the microwave.


241
00:22:05.843 --> 00:22:09.262
And, uh, my grandmother dropped
acid and she freaked out


242
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.223
and hijacked a school
bus full of penguins,


243
00:22:12.391 --> 00:22:16.311
so it's kind of a family crisis,
so come back later? Great.


244
00:22:48.427 --> 00:22:53.640
The three cardinal
trapezoidal formations


245
00:22:53.808 --> 00:22:56.893
hereto made orientable
in our diagram


246
00:22:57.061 --> 00:23:03.191
by connecting the various points
H-I-G-K, P-E-G-Q and L-M-N-O,


247
00:23:03.359 --> 00:23:07.404
creating our geometric
configurations,


248
00:23:07.571 --> 00:23:11.991
which have no properties,
but with location


249
00:23:13.452 --> 00:23:21.418
are equal to the described
triangle, C-A-B, quintuplicated.


250
00:23:21.585 --> 00:23:23.586
Therefore,

251
00:23:25.005 --> 00:23:29.926
it is also the five triangles
composing the aforementioned N-I-G-H,


252
00:23:30.094 --> 00:23:33.596
each are equal to the triangle
C-A-B in this geometric concept.


253
00:23:35.641 --> 00:23:38.560
Therefore, in a like manner,

254
00:23:38.728 --> 00:23:44.941
the geometric metaphors can
derive a repeated vectoral sum.


255
00:23:45.109 --> 00:23:47.527
This was your assignment.

256
00:23:48.112 --> 00:23:51.197
And I would like to
see the results.


257
00:23:51.365 --> 00:23:53.116
Please, take them out.

258
00:24:18.225 --> 00:24:19.726
Oops.

259
00:24:20.144 --> 00:24:22.729
- Sophia.
- Ooh, ooh!


260
00:24:22.897 --> 00:24:26.483
- And Buster.
- Oh, please.


261
00:24:26.901 --> 00:24:30.153
- And Beth.
- Please, please, please.


262
00:24:32.198 --> 00:24:33.782
- And--
- Oh, please.


263
00:24:33.949 --> 00:24:35.742
Oh, please, please, please.

264
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.162
Mr. Myer.

265
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.499
Please join us at the blackboard
and show us your solution


266
00:24:42.666 --> 00:24:45.627
to this paltry geometric dilemma.

267
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.884
Okay.

268
00:25:08.567 --> 00:25:10.401
Oh, sorry.

269
00:25:42.518 --> 00:25:44.269
For God's sakes, Lane,
would you relax?


270
00:25:44.436 --> 00:25:46.062
It's just our virginity.

271
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.147
Oh, yeah, I agree, totally.

272
00:25:48.315 --> 00:25:50.108
I feel we should tell someone
or do something,


273
00:25:50.276 --> 00:25:52.610
or get my dad's Polaroid or something.

274
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.280
Mm. What was that?

275
00:25:55.447 --> 00:25:57.448
- What was what?
- I heard something.


276
00:25:57.616 --> 00:26:00.785
Beth, we're in the most secluded
place in the northern hemisphere.


277
00:26:00.953 --> 00:26:04.080
I assure you, we are totally alone.

278
00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.625
Come on.

279
00:26:11.171 --> 00:26:12.839
What's wrong?

280
00:26:13.257 --> 00:26:14.966
That thing I put on me?

281
00:26:15.134 --> 00:26:16.593
It broke.

282
00:26:17.219 --> 00:26:19.095
Broke? It broke?

283
00:26:19.263 --> 00:26:21.014
Take it easy, Beth.
I'll buy a new one.


284
00:26:21.181 --> 00:26:23.766
I don't want a new one.
Do you know what that means?


285
00:26:23.934 --> 00:26:25.602
I'm sorry! Iâ€™m sorry!

286
00:26:35.821 --> 00:26:39.574
No, no, no, Iâ€™ll see you all tomorrow.

287
00:26:39.742 --> 00:26:44.704
Just remember to memorize pages 39 to 110
for tomorrow's lesson.


288
00:26:44.872 --> 00:26:46.873
All right. Cool.

289
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:48.374
All right.

290
00:26:58.594 --> 00:27:00.178
Lane,

291
00:27:00.763 --> 00:27:01.846
listen.

292
00:27:02.014 --> 00:27:04.307
I've been thinking about
what you told me last night


293
00:27:04.475 --> 00:27:06.476
and I've decided I'm gonna help you.

294
00:27:06.644 --> 00:27:08.102
How?

295
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:14.651
Lane, I've been going to this high school
for seven and a half years.


296
00:27:14.818 --> 00:27:16.653
I'm no dummy.

297
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.530
I know high-school girls.

298
00:27:20.032 --> 00:27:21.366
Two things...

299
00:27:21.533 --> 00:27:25.119
One, how about your sax?

300
00:27:25.287 --> 00:27:28.247
I mean, the thing about Roy is,
he plays the guitar.


301
00:27:28.415 --> 00:27:30.833
- He does?
- Yeah, you know, girls love that.


302
00:27:31.001 --> 00:27:33.503
Why don't you take up your sax again?

303
00:27:34.004 --> 00:27:35.046
Number two?

304
00:27:36.548 --> 00:27:39.175
The K-12, dude.

305
00:27:39.343 --> 00:27:45.765
You make a gnarly run like that and girls
will get sterile just looking at you.


306
00:27:46.058 --> 00:27:47.767
Mr. Myer.

307
00:27:47.935 --> 00:27:51.729
Would you stay behind?
I'd like a word with you.


308
00:27:52.982 --> 00:27:54.482
We'll do this.

309
00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.442
Talk to you later.

310
00:27:57.111 --> 00:27:58.736
Lane?

311
00:27:59.321 --> 00:28:00.947
Yes, sir?

312
00:28:02.866 --> 00:28:05.159
This is a bit awkward.

313
00:28:05.327 --> 00:28:06.995
Yes, sir.

314
00:28:08.372 --> 00:28:10.164
Well,

315
00:28:11.125 --> 00:28:14.293
I've heard a few things and, um...

316
00:28:15.337 --> 00:28:18.172
Well, I was wondering

317
00:28:18.382 --> 00:28:20.466
if you would mind
if I took out Beth?


318
00:29:14.938 --> 00:29:17.648
<i>â™ª And I love you so much â™ª</i>

319
00:29:20.736 --> 00:29:26.741
<i>â™ª Because I met you in first grade
My sweetheart â™ª</i>


320
00:29:31.038 --> 00:29:32.288
Come on.

321
00:29:38.712 --> 00:29:41.339
What'd you go and do that for?

322
00:29:43.592 --> 00:29:45.718
Really, Lane, why?

323
00:29:45.886 --> 00:29:47.053
That's sick.

324
00:29:47.221 --> 00:29:48.262
Sick?

325
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.014
Beth, I love you.

326
00:29:50.182 --> 00:29:51.474
How could you dump me for him?

327
00:29:51.642 --> 00:29:54.894
Face it, Lane. You're a no-show.
A loss.


328
00:29:55.062 --> 00:29:58.397
You're immature. You can't do
a single thing by yourself.


329
00:29:58.565 --> 00:30:00.566
You're a spastic nervebag
all the time.


330
00:30:00.734 --> 00:30:03.528
And besides, Roy can ski the K-12.

331
00:30:03.695 --> 00:30:05.822
How could I enjoy the rest
of my high-school existence


332
00:30:05.989 --> 00:30:07.031
with you as a boyfriend?

333
00:30:07.199 --> 00:30:10.159
Any girl in school would be overwhelmed
with sweat just to go out with me.


334
00:30:10.327 --> 00:30:12.120
Uh-huh.

335
00:30:12.329 --> 00:30:15.414
- Win.
- Hey, good defense.


336
00:30:19.795 --> 00:30:22.130
The place is awful, man.

337
00:30:26.385 --> 00:30:30.012
Ha! Chris Crummins?
You haven't got a chance.


338
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.514
She'd go out with me in a second.

339
00:30:31.682 --> 00:30:33.599
Listen, Lane.
You forget.


340
00:30:33.767 --> 00:30:35.852
Chris Crummins dates
the basketball team.


341
00:30:36.019 --> 00:30:39.438
Not certain members of the team, Lane.
The whole team.


342
00:30:39.606 --> 00:30:41.732
You so much as talk to her
and you're dead.


343
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.401
So let's just say you give it up?

344
00:30:43.569 --> 00:30:46.654
Yeah, Oscar Mayer. I think
that's a fine idea.


345
00:30:46.822 --> 00:30:48.364
I will not give it up, Beth.

346
00:30:48.532 --> 00:30:52.201
You're the one who's gonna be sorry.
Someday you'll want me back.


347
00:30:58.041 --> 00:30:59.584
Sorry.

348
00:31:03.213 --> 00:31:04.338
I'm gonna get some milk.

349
00:31:06.216 --> 00:31:07.925
Just one milk.

350
00:31:08.093 --> 00:31:09.719
I'll be okay.

351
00:31:12.848 --> 00:31:14.891
Watch this.

352
00:31:18.645 --> 00:31:19.687
Can I just borrow these?

353
00:31:19.855 --> 00:31:21.981
- Hey, what's the big idea?
- Come on. Let me borrow--


354
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:26.777
Here, just buy yourself another leotard
and I'll be back in a minute, okay?


355
00:31:31.491 --> 00:31:34.035
Oh, no, that's it.

356
00:31:39.625 --> 00:31:41.042
Excuse me.

357
00:31:44.504 --> 00:31:49.508
I was thinking, uh, you skate,
I skate, we skate.


358
00:31:49.676 --> 00:31:51.427
Uh, maybe we could get together
and kind of--


359
00:31:51.595 --> 00:31:54.388
- You're a jerk.
- Be a skating team.


360
00:32:01.605 --> 00:32:03.439
- Ow. Chris, I was saying before--
- Bye-bye.


361
00:32:04.816 --> 00:32:06.400
- Bye, see you later, guys.
- Whoa!


362
00:32:49.528 --> 00:32:51.237
- Lane?
- What?


363
00:32:51.405 --> 00:32:53.864
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.


364
00:32:54.032 --> 00:32:56.450
Yes, you are.

365
00:32:57.035 --> 00:33:00.496
Oh, buck up, little camper.

366
00:33:00.664 --> 00:33:04.000
We'll beat that slope together.

367
00:33:04.668 --> 00:33:07.336
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


368
00:33:09.047 --> 00:33:11.549
I'm right behind you, buddy.

369
00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:31.777
Tsk. Man, now, that's a real shame
when folks be throwing away


370
00:33:31.945 --> 00:33:34.697
a perfectly good white boy like that.

371
00:33:38.118 --> 00:33:40.870
You know, if I could just
get past this first lift,


372
00:33:41.038 --> 00:33:44.415
the rest would be a breeze. I know it.
I'm telling you, Charles.


373
00:33:44.875 --> 00:33:47.084
Charles? Charles.

374
00:33:47.252 --> 00:33:50.671
Hold on, wait a minute. Wait one second.
I think Iâ€™m on to something here.


375
00:33:50.839 --> 00:33:54.633
This is pure snow.
It's everywhere.


376
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:57.970
Have you any idea what the street
value of this mountain is?


377
00:33:58.138 --> 00:33:59.722
- Charles.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.


378
00:34:10.025 --> 00:34:12.109
Outrageous.

379
00:34:13.111 --> 00:34:16.405
I think I froze the
left half of my brain.


380
00:34:16.573 --> 00:34:19.367
Look, I can't move my right arm.

381
00:34:19.534 --> 00:34:20.743
Will you get serious?

382
00:34:20.911 --> 00:34:24.497
Oh, look, dude.
It's Christmas Eve.


383
00:34:24.664 --> 00:34:25.998
I could be home right now,

384
00:34:26.166 --> 00:34:30.127
drinking this monster eggnog my
brother makes with lighter fluid.


385
00:34:30.295 --> 00:34:32.880
Now, you've been staring over
that edge for hours,


386
00:34:33.048 --> 00:34:35.341
but people die down there.

387
00:34:35.509 --> 00:34:39.637
And dying when you're not really sick
is really sick, you know? Really.


388
00:34:39.805 --> 00:34:41.889
Charles, this is very important to me.

389
00:34:42.057 --> 00:34:45.142
I mean, really. I mean, if I don't
believe in myself, I'm nothing.


390
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.687
I'll be as bad as my neighbor, Ricky Smith,
who sits around crocheting all day


391
00:34:48.855 --> 00:34:51.315
and snorting nasal spray.
I gotta do it.


392
00:34:51.483 --> 00:34:53.150
He snorts nasal spray?

393
00:34:53.318 --> 00:34:54.735
You know where I could score some?

394
00:34:54.903 --> 00:34:58.072
- Are you gonna help me or not?
- All right, all right. All right.


395
00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.907
I'll tell you what to do.

396
00:35:00.659 --> 00:35:04.620
Go that way, really fast.

397
00:35:04.788 --> 00:35:09.375
If something gets in your way...
turn.


398
00:35:10.794 --> 00:35:12.920
What a coach.

399
00:35:13.755 --> 00:35:15.589
All right, I'm gonna do it.

400
00:35:31.189 --> 00:35:32.481
All right!

401
00:35:32.649 --> 00:35:34.900
Now, turn!

402
00:35:44.244 --> 00:35:47.163
Hello, Beth. Hey, it's Christmas.

403
00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:50.916
I was thinking maybe, um,
me and you could--


404
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.545
No, no. No, we didn't open
our presents yet.


405
00:35:54.713 --> 00:35:56.297
You did.

406
00:35:57.174 --> 00:35:59.508
The cutest thing ever.

407
00:36:00.302 --> 00:36:02.303
From Roy.

408
00:36:04.014 --> 00:36:07.308
A giant teddy bear,
bigger than you.


409
00:36:07.476 --> 00:36:09.810
Sounds great.

410
00:36:10.687 --> 00:36:12.980
No, it really does sound good.

411
00:36:13.148 --> 00:36:17.067
Look, Beth, I gotta go.
The Christmas tree's on fire.


412
00:36:38.298 --> 00:36:41.133
Now, open this one next.

413
00:36:42.552 --> 00:36:46.263
I remembered how much you liked the
chocolate nut brownie in this one.


414
00:36:46.431 --> 00:36:51.519
And, look, corn in seasoned sauce.
Heh. He likes corn.


415
00:36:54.231 --> 00:36:58.692
Now, come on, Ricky, don't be shy.
Give her your present.


416
00:37:01.196 --> 00:37:04.365
Come on, give her your present.

417
00:37:04.866 --> 00:37:06.575
Come on.

418
00:37:14.584 --> 00:37:17.211
That's a Christmas present.

419
00:37:18.547 --> 00:37:21.632
Do you have Christmas in France?

420
00:37:22.968 --> 00:37:28.681
Christmas.

421
00:37:28.848 --> 00:37:31.475
Yeah, it's from Ricky.

422
00:37:45.574 --> 00:37:48.200
You can take that wherever you go

423
00:37:48.368 --> 00:37:52.621
to always remember your trip
to the United States.


424
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.843
Why--?

425
00:38:09.055 --> 00:38:11.056
How come you're so small?

426
00:38:11.224 --> 00:38:16.729
Now, everyone is going to
be wearing one of these this year.


427
00:38:17.105 --> 00:38:19.940
Honey, what have you done?

428
00:38:20.108 --> 00:38:22.151
Right there.

429
00:38:22.736 --> 00:38:25.613
It's real aardvark fur.

430
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.197
Really?

431
00:38:27.365 --> 00:38:32.911
Wow. Oh, honey, it's sure warm.

432
00:38:33.079 --> 00:38:37.875
Now for the best part.
Oh, the hood.


433
00:38:43.173 --> 00:38:45.674
Everybody's gonna be wearing
one of these?


434
00:38:45.842 --> 00:38:47.843
Isn't it fun?

435
00:39:00.732 --> 00:39:03.317
- What is it?
- I'll show you soon. Almost there.


436
00:39:03.485 --> 00:39:04.735
You'll see it in a second, okay?

437
00:39:04.903 --> 00:39:06.528
- Ready? Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.


438
00:39:06.696 --> 00:39:07.905
- Okay.
- All right.


439
00:39:08.073 --> 00:39:09.782
Ta-da.

440
00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:12.951
Al, you fixed the windows.

441
00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:16.038
Oh, it's a Christmas miracle.

442
00:39:16.206 --> 00:39:19.625
Wait a minute, Mr. Bear.
This is crazy.


443
00:39:19.793 --> 00:39:21.168
I bet we get her back.

444
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.685
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.


445
00:40:03.962 --> 00:40:05.379
Hi, Badger.

446
00:40:05.547 --> 00:40:08.841
Your book on How to Pick Up
Trashy Women came today.


447
00:40:09.008 --> 00:40:10.426
Tell me something.

448
00:40:10.593 --> 00:40:15.222
What's a little boy like you doing
with big-boy smut like this?


449
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.314
Hi, Lane. I was just wondering--

450
00:40:24.482 --> 00:40:27.151
I mean, I know that we don't
even know each other,


451
00:40:27.318 --> 00:40:29.903
but I know that you were going out
with that girl, Beth,


452
00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:32.406
and I can see that you're not
going out with her anymore


453
00:40:32.574 --> 00:40:35.659
and I was wondering if perhaps
I could just be with her,


454
00:40:35.827 --> 00:40:38.954
you know, go to the movies
and have soda.


455
00:40:42.083 --> 00:40:44.793
Lane, can I talk to you
for a moment, please?


456
00:40:45.628 --> 00:40:48.881
- Yeah.
- Come in here and sit down, young man.


457
00:40:54.095 --> 00:40:56.054
Look, Dad. I'm really sorry
about the garage door.


458
00:40:56.222 --> 00:40:57.681
Let me give you the bottom line.

459
00:40:58.224 --> 00:41:00.142
I think it would be entirely beneficial

460
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.020
if you were to re-enter the
sociological mainstream


461
00:41:03.188 --> 00:41:06.899
by re-engaging in the ritual act of
dating members of the opposite sex.


462
00:41:07.066 --> 00:41:09.318
I don't wanna date other girls, Dad.
I wanna date Beth.


463
00:41:09.486 --> 00:41:12.738
Well, I'm sorry to inform you that you
are gonna start dating other girls.


464
00:41:12.906 --> 00:41:14.406
- Starting tonight.
- Oh?


465
00:41:14.574 --> 00:41:17.367
Tonight at 6:00,
you're picking up Joanne Greenwald.


466
00:41:17.535 --> 00:41:20.162
- Your law partner's daughter?
- That's right.


467
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.748
The one with the big antenna
on her face?


468
00:41:23.291 --> 00:41:26.043
Come on, Lane.

469
00:41:26.294 --> 00:41:28.086
Mellow off.

470
00:41:28.254 --> 00:41:30.297
I mean, it's a brand-new year.

471
00:41:30.465 --> 00:41:32.341
There's a New Year's Eve dance
at your school.


472
00:41:32.509 --> 00:41:34.760
You kids love this disco thing.

473
00:41:34.928 --> 00:41:36.720
Disco. Come on, Dad.

474
00:41:36.888 --> 00:41:40.849
You are really
bringing me over, man.


475
00:41:46.356 --> 00:41:48.273
Six o'clock.

476
00:41:48.525 --> 00:41:50.275
- Right off.
- On.


477
00:41:50.443 --> 00:41:51.610
On, right.

478
00:41:51.778 --> 00:41:54.905
All right, Joanne Greenwald,
you horrible thing.


479
00:41:55.073 --> 00:41:58.492
Here's your one chance to
go out with a real stud.


480
00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:03.121
One night with me and she'll probably
go blind with ecstasy, poor creature.


481
00:42:03.289 --> 00:42:07.793
Gee, I hope she doesn't grab on to my leg
and start crying when the date's over.


482
00:42:07.961 --> 00:42:10.254
Oh, God. What will you do?

483
00:42:26.938 --> 00:42:28.397
All right, Joanne Greenwald.

484
00:42:35.113 --> 00:42:36.697
Hi, Joanne.

485
00:42:37.073 --> 00:42:40.325
Okay, pal.
Let's get something straight.


486
00:42:40.493 --> 00:42:41.702
I don't wanna go out with you.

487
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.580
And I'm just doing this as
a favor to my dad, right?


488
00:42:44.747 --> 00:42:47.124
You're happy to be with me, we
can go out and have a great--


489
00:42:47.292 --> 00:42:49.835
So let's make it a whole lot
easy on ourselves, shall we?


490
00:42:50.003 --> 00:42:51.670
Now, first we would
have gone to dinner.


491
00:42:51.838 --> 00:42:56.174
That's 10 bucks apiece,
unless you're a cheapskate.


492
00:42:56.342 --> 00:42:58.760
But I'm willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt.


493
00:42:58.928 --> 00:43:01.054
- Thanks.
- I would have ordered double desserts,


494
00:43:01.222 --> 00:43:02.806
that's $22 altogether.

495
00:43:02.974 --> 00:43:05.225
Tax and tip, 25.

496
00:43:05.393 --> 00:43:08.896
Making it a grand total of $26.37.

497
00:43:09.063 --> 00:43:13.191
Half of which is approximately $13.67.

498
00:43:13.359 --> 00:43:18.238
Now, why don't you just give me that

499
00:43:18.406 --> 00:43:20.616
- Do you take checks?
- Oh, sure.

No? That's okay,

Monique, I had no idea

You shouldn't make me worry.

- ...acquaintance.
- A number of times, yes.


568

She's a delightful girl

Mother will pick us up at

570
00:48:27.715 --> 00:48:29.216
She'll be very disappointed

571
00:48:29.383 --> 00:48:32.510
if we aren't right at the
entrance of the school.


572
00:48:32.678 --> 00:48:34.304
Uh, Ricky, I'll tell you what.

573
00:48:34.472 --> 00:48:36.598
Why don't you wait in the front
of the school


574
00:48:36.766 --> 00:48:39.226
and when Mom gets here,
you have her honk the old horn.


575
00:48:39.393 --> 00:48:42.479
Monique and I would like to
continue our conversation.


576
00:48:43.064 --> 00:48:47.025
You should not upset Mother ever.

577
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:55.575
I guess people do a lot
of handshaking in France.


578
00:48:57.161 --> 00:48:59.621
Oh, Myer. Listen, I wanted
to let you know


579
00:48:59.789 --> 00:49:02.123
there is an opening on
the water ballet team.


580
00:49:03.542 --> 00:49:06.461
I can make a call if you want.
Come on.


581
00:49:06.629 --> 00:49:08.213
All right.

582
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:11.800
- All right, start the day, Big Roy.
- Wait up. Hey, baby.


583
00:49:11.968 --> 00:49:14.636
Monique. Monique,
why aren't you with Ricky?


584
00:49:15.346 --> 00:49:16.388
Monique!

585
00:49:17.181 --> 00:49:20.308
Well, nice meeting you.
Good night. Uh...


586
00:49:24.313 --> 00:49:26.356
Why weren't you there as I told you?

587
00:49:26.524 --> 00:49:27.649
I told her, Mom.

588
00:49:27.817 --> 00:49:30.777
I know. Don't you understand English?

589
00:49:31.153 --> 00:49:32.237
Bye.

590
00:49:49.547 --> 00:49:58.596
Two dollars.

591
00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.395
Two dollars.

592
00:50:26.709 --> 00:50:29.586
Keys!

593
00:50:42.391 --> 00:50:44.184
- Hi, Lane.
- Ah!


594
00:50:44.352 --> 00:50:47.312
- How was your date?
- They're out there, Dad. They're after me.


595
00:51:18.135 --> 00:51:19.844
Happy New Year.

596
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:47.872
Honey, where's Lane?

597
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.541
Oh, he just came in.

598
00:51:49.708 --> 00:51:52.460
He went skiing this morning
with Charles de Mar.


599
00:51:52.628 --> 00:51:54.379
I think he's in the shower.

600
00:52:05.891 --> 00:52:08.184
What's taking him so long? Lane.

601
00:52:08.352 --> 00:52:10.728
I told you I got him this job.
It's his first day of work.


602
00:52:10.896 --> 00:52:12.063
I don't want him to be late.

603
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:51.019
Lane.

604
00:52:51.187 --> 00:52:52.604
You better--

605
00:53:02.948 --> 00:53:04.741
Myer.

606
00:53:15.377 --> 00:53:16.836
So you're Al Myer's kid.

607
00:53:17.004 --> 00:53:18.796
Yes, I am.

608
00:53:19.048 --> 00:53:20.548
You look pretty stupid to me.

609
00:53:21.759 --> 00:53:23.051
Thank you.

610
00:53:23.219 --> 00:53:25.845
Let's see if you have
any brains, huh?


611
00:53:27.097 --> 00:53:29.015
First, you take the meat.
Understand?


612
00:53:29.183 --> 00:53:30.475
Yeah.

613
00:53:30.643 --> 00:53:33.603
Then you pat it in the pig mold.

614
00:53:33.771 --> 00:53:37.440
- Push it in the pig mold.
- No. This is a push.


615
00:53:37.608 --> 00:53:39.234
This is a pat.

616
00:53:39.401 --> 00:53:41.903
Then you take the pig mold and
you put it up on the tray.


617
00:53:43.072 --> 00:53:45.073
Now, put on this hat.

618
00:53:46.116 --> 00:53:47.784
You see that sign out there?

619
00:53:48.285 --> 00:53:49.827
You wear it with pride.

620
00:53:49.995 --> 00:53:51.746
Put it on.

621
00:53:53.499 --> 00:53:54.791
Ow.

622
00:53:56.585 --> 00:53:58.586
You gotta have pride and class
in this business.


623
00:53:58.754 --> 00:54:01.130
You understand this, kid?
Now...


624
00:54:05.427 --> 00:54:08.596
- What's that?
- Those are the keys to this establishment.


625
00:54:09.223 --> 00:54:11.849
I want you in here at 6 a.m.
Saturday morning.


626
00:54:12.017 --> 00:54:13.977
Now, this place has to
be swept and mopped up


627
00:54:14.144 --> 00:54:16.020
before the breakfast crew get here.

628
00:54:16.188 --> 00:54:18.565
- Roger.
- All right.


629
00:54:20.359 --> 00:54:23.194
- Where are you going?
- Go wash my hands. I gotta mold and pat.


630
00:54:23.362 --> 00:54:26.364
You wash your hands on your own time, boy.
Now get to work.


631
00:54:26.532 --> 00:54:27.865
Yes, sir.

632
00:54:29.743 --> 00:54:31.202
- Fat pig.
- What?


633
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:32.745
Pat. Pat pig.

634
00:54:53.851 --> 00:54:56.311
Everybody wants some.

635
00:55:01.191 --> 00:55:03.067
I'll show you what everybody wants.

636
00:55:08.115 --> 00:55:11.326
Mad! All of you mad!
Mad! Me, a fool?


637
00:56:02.419 --> 00:56:04.712
It's alive. Ha, ha.

638
00:56:08.092 --> 00:56:09.384
Ow!

639
00:56:12.262 --> 00:56:14.597
Oh, yeah.

640
00:56:16.433 --> 00:56:18.142
Oh, yeah.

641
00:56:23.357 --> 00:56:28.319
<i>â™ª You can't get romantic
on a subway ride â™ª</i>


642
00:56:29.988 --> 00:56:34.826
<i>â™ª And doctor don't like it
Says you're wasting your time â™ª</i>


643
00:56:35.869 --> 00:56:39.038
<i>â™ª But everybody wants some â™ª</i>

644
00:56:39.206 --> 00:56:42.125
<i>â™ª I want some too â™ª</i>

645
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:45.503
<i>â™ª Everybody wants some â™ª</i>

646
00:56:45.671 --> 00:56:47.588
<i>â™ª Baby, how about you? â™ª</i>

647
00:56:48.257 --> 00:56:50.383
<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª</i>

648
00:56:50.551 --> 00:56:55.012
<i>â™ª I took a mobile light

650
00:57:02.521 --> 00:57:07.358
<i>â™ª Anybody want some?
I want some too â™ª</i>


651
00:57:07.526 --> 00:57:09.694
Myer!

652
00:57:13.907 --> 00:57:15.199
Oops.

653
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:37.221
Looking really good today, buddy.
Looking real good.


654
00:57:39.183 --> 00:57:40.349
Goon.

655
00:57:48.734 --> 00:57:50.526
All right.

656
00:57:52.738 --> 00:57:53.780
This is it.

657
00:58:09.129 --> 00:58:11.798
Look, Barney, a falling star.

658
00:58:11.965 --> 00:58:13.382
Yeah.

659
00:58:13.842 --> 00:58:15.927
- Make a wish, Barney.
- A wish?


660
00:58:16.094 --> 00:58:17.887
They say if you
wish on a falling star,

661
00:58:18.055 --> 00:58:19.597
your wish will come true.

662
00:58:19.765 --> 00:58:21.098
No kidding.

663
00:58:23.018 --> 00:58:25.770
Hey, what did you wish for, Betty, huh?

664
00:58:25.938 --> 00:58:27.438
- What?
- Can't tell you.


665
00:58:27.606 --> 00:58:30.942
It will spoil the wish. And don't
tell me your wish either, Barney.


666
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:33.194
I won't.

667
00:58:33.987 --> 00:58:35.154
Hey there, Lane.

668
00:58:35.322 --> 00:58:38.157
I know this is a little awkward,
me being a cartoon and all.


669
00:58:38.617 --> 00:58:42.036
I was just wondering how you'd
feel if I took out Beth.


670
00:59:09.147 --> 00:59:11.440
- Matches.
- Oh, Lane.


671
00:59:11.608 --> 00:59:13.860
Lane, where have you been?

672
00:59:14.027 --> 00:59:16.529
We've all been waiting for you.

673
00:59:16.697 --> 00:59:19.532
You come and sit right down here.

674
00:59:22.119 --> 00:59:23.619
Have you met Monique?

675
00:59:23.787 --> 00:59:24.912
Hi.

676
00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.290
Now, in honor of our special guest,

677
00:59:27.457 --> 00:59:30.793
I've created "dinner mon doo."

678
00:59:30.961 --> 00:59:33.754
First, we have...

679
00:59:34.381 --> 00:59:37.174
..."franch" fries.

680
00:59:37.342 --> 00:59:39.218
And...

681
00:59:39.803 --> 00:59:42.763
..."Franch" dressing.

682
00:59:43.223 --> 00:59:46.976
And "Franch" bread.

683
00:59:47.144 --> 00:59:49.437
And to drink, ta-da,

684
00:59:50.063 --> 00:59:51.480
Peru.

685
00:59:53.025 --> 00:59:58.988
Jenny Myer, you really do go to the
outer limits to make an impression.


686
01:00:01.742 --> 01:00:03.951
Oh, Monique.

687
01:00:04.119 --> 01:00:05.745
Enjoying your stay in our town?

688
01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:12.335
I said, are you enjoying
your stay in our town?


689
01:00:12.502 --> 01:00:14.003
She doesn't speak English, Dad.

690
01:00:14.171 --> 01:00:15.504
Of course she does.

691
01:00:15.923 --> 01:00:18.090
Are you enjoying your stay--?

692
01:00:18.258 --> 01:00:20.885
It's no good, Al.
She don't speak a word.


693
01:00:21.053 --> 01:00:22.970
Wait, I thought these
foreign exchange students


694
01:00:23.138 --> 01:00:25.097
had to speak some English
to come over here.


695
01:00:25.265 --> 01:00:28.142
Well, as we're discovering
around our household,


696
01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:32.229
you don't need words to speak
the, uh, international language.


697
01:00:32.397 --> 01:00:34.440
Right, Ricky?

698
01:00:34.608 --> 01:00:36.400
- Ha, ha.
- Huh?


699
01:00:37.319 --> 01:00:40.071
The international language.
Ha, ha, ha.


700
01:00:41.448 --> 01:00:43.574
You know?

701
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:46.494
Love.

702
01:00:46.662 --> 01:00:47.870
The language of love.

703
01:00:48.664 --> 01:00:50.414
I think Monique and
our little Ricky


704
01:00:50.582 --> 01:00:55.044
have a regular, um, cross-continental
romance brewing here.


705
01:00:56.046 --> 01:00:57.505
- Him?
- Mm-hm.


706
01:00:57.798 --> 01:00:59.256
- And her?
- Mm-hm.


707
01:00:59.424 --> 01:01:01.175
That makes sense.

708
01:01:07.391 --> 01:01:08.766
What does that mean?

709
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:14.063
- I think she wants to use the bathroom.
- Uh-huh.


710
01:01:14.231 --> 01:01:19.902
It's down the hall, second door
on the left, Monique.


711
01:01:23.949 --> 01:01:28.035
Jennifer, ahem, this is fabulous liquor.

712
01:01:28.662 --> 01:01:33.165
Reminds me of the moonshine Ricky's
dead pappy use to make. Ha, ha.


713
01:01:33.542 --> 01:01:36.377
- God bless him.
- Mrs. Smith, no, wait!


714
01:01:40.215 --> 01:01:43.050
Gee, Iâ€™m real sorry your
mom blew up, Ricky.


715
01:01:43.844 --> 01:01:44.927
Doctor said she'll be okay.

716
01:01:45.095 --> 01:01:48.723
I guess she just won't be able to eat
spicy foods for a while. Ha, ha.


717
01:01:56.106 --> 01:01:58.482
Oh, no, not now.

718
01:02:01.737 --> 01:02:04.822
- What do they want?
- They wanna race.


719
01:02:05.657 --> 01:02:09.326
Lane Myer, the kid from Greendale.

720
01:02:09.494 --> 01:02:11.787
- See, here's a good example.
- I don't know.


721
01:02:11.955 --> 01:02:13.622
Two brothers, one speaks no English,

722
01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:17.209
the other learned how to speak English
from watching <i>The Wide World of Sports.</i>


723
01:02:17.377 --> 01:02:18.544
You tell me, which is better...

724
01:02:18.712 --> 01:02:21.839
Speaking no English at all
or speaking Howard Cosell?


725
01:02:22.966 --> 01:02:26.427
The chances seem slim
that this once-great


726
01:02:26.595 --> 01:02:29.972
has the nerve, the desire
to win that he once had--


727
01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.600
Obey the speed limits.
A car is not a toy.


728
01:02:32.768 --> 01:02:35.311
The man has obviously
admitted defeat.


729
01:02:41.151 --> 01:02:42.234
We're gonna take these guys.

730
01:02:42.402 --> 01:02:45.237
- It's a close race. Myer takes the lead.
- Whoo!


731
01:02:45.405 --> 01:02:47.656
This could go in Myer's favor.

732
01:02:47.824 --> 01:02:50.534
You're exceeding the speed limit.
Lane Myer, slow down.


733
01:02:54.081 --> 01:02:57.750
Myer takes the lead.
This could go in Myer's favor.


734
01:02:57.918 --> 01:03:00.920
- It's close. Very, very close.
- Aah!


735
01:03:30.158 --> 01:03:31.909
Oh, my God.

736
01:03:32.285 --> 01:03:34.537
Oh, my God, Ricky's dead.
Ricky, are you dead?


737
01:03:34.704 --> 01:03:37.039
I think he's dead. Monique.

738
01:03:37.207 --> 01:03:40.417
Monique, Iâ€™m sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't...


739
01:03:40.794 --> 01:03:42.211
Monique?

740
01:03:54.182 --> 01:03:56.517
I'm telling my mom.

741
01:04:10.574 --> 01:04:12.199
See you later.

742
01:04:13.743 --> 01:04:16.579
Ever since I got my license, those
kamikaze pilots have been after me.


743
01:04:16.746 --> 01:04:18.789
If only I had my Camaro.
If I had my Camaro running,


744
01:04:18.957 --> 01:04:21.000
I would blow those boys
off the street. Vroom!


745
01:04:21.168 --> 01:04:22.918
That thing goes so fast.
It's got an engine--


746
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:50.863
- Looks good, huh?
- Heh, heh.


747
01:04:51.031 --> 01:04:54.491
Well, I guess after my mom's cooking,
you'll probably be able to tolerate anything.


748
01:04:54.659 --> 01:04:57.161
Have a Ding Dong. They're good.

749
01:04:57.871 --> 01:04:59.747
Ooh, there they are.

750
01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.010
Don't get me wrong. My mom means well.
She really does.


751
01:05:13.178 --> 01:05:16.972
Cooking's her new thing.
She cooks all the time now.


752
01:05:17.307 --> 01:05:21.560
- It's a lot better than how it used to be.
- Hey, <i>buenos dias.</i>


753
01:05:21.811 --> 01:05:24.480
<i>Voulez-vouz coucher
avec moi ce soir?</i>


754
01:05:27.359 --> 01:05:29.026
Listen, Myer, I just stopped by
to tell you


755
01:05:29.194 --> 01:05:32.071
I'm gonna be picking a new captain
for the ski team on Sunday.


756
01:05:32.239 --> 01:05:36.867
All you gotta do to be
captain, Myers, is beat me.


757
01:05:37.035 --> 01:05:41.455
I mean, the tryouts won't be the same
if you're not there, champ.


758
01:05:44.167 --> 01:05:47.461
So, uh, what are you and Myer
talking about?


759
01:05:47.629 --> 01:05:49.713
Is he telling you what
a great lover he is?


760
01:05:49.881 --> 01:05:52.508
She only speaks French, Roy.
She doesn't speak imbecile.


761
01:05:52.676 --> 01:05:54.051
Ooh.

762
01:05:54.678 --> 01:06:00.557
Myer, there's one language that
I speak that all women understand.


763
01:06:00.725 --> 01:06:03.394
Just ask your last girlfriend.

764
01:06:03.937 --> 01:06:06.397
Would you like to learn
some new words?


765
01:06:06.564 --> 01:06:08.232
Shit! Stupid!

766
01:06:10.902 --> 01:06:13.570
- What's going on here?
- Nothing!


767
01:06:13.738 --> 01:06:15.781
Just learning that Myer's
new frog girlfriend here


768
01:06:15.949 --> 01:06:17.324
is just as much as
a clod as he is.

769
01:06:17.492 --> 01:06:18.993
Hey, hold on a minute, champ.

770
01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.412
You think you're tough because
you're captain of the team.


771
01:06:21.579 --> 01:06:24.290
- I could out-ski you any day of the week.
- Oh, really?


772
01:06:24.457 --> 01:06:26.375
You wanna race, I'll take
you on any day, sucker.


773
01:06:26.543 --> 01:06:29.378
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- From the K-12, champ.


774
01:06:29.546 --> 01:06:32.298
- Ha, ha.
- Chicken.


775
01:06:32.465 --> 01:06:34.800
- What did you say?
- Anytime. You name it.


776
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.304
Oh, Myer, you're digging
your own grave.


777
01:06:38.471 --> 01:06:40.139
No one has to know.
Just me and you.


778
01:06:40.557 --> 01:06:42.808
Sunday, high noon.

779
01:06:42.976 --> 01:06:44.518
You're on.

780
01:06:49.691 --> 01:06:50.983
<i>This just in.</i>

781
01:06:51.151 --> 01:06:57.197
<i>Lane Myer will be racing Roy Stalin
down K-12 this Sunday at 12 noon.</i>


782
01:07:00.952 --> 01:07:03.412
Way to go, Lane.

783
01:07:05.582 --> 01:07:06.832
I must be brain-damaged.

784
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.626
I'm gonna race, I'm gonna lose,
and I'm gonna die.


785
01:07:13.173 --> 01:07:16.050
That? Itâ€™s a car.

786
01:07:16.217 --> 01:07:19.053
The Camaro. Remember, I was
telling you about it before?


787
01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:20.846
It doesn't work. 
Nothing works.

788
01:07:21.014 --> 01:07:23.849
My brother, he's building a space shuttle
out of household appliances.


789
01:07:24.017 --> 01:07:25.267
Vacuum cleaners and blenders.

790
01:07:25.435 --> 01:07:28.812
That thing's probably gonna work. I
can't get that out of the driveway.


791
01:07:35.362 --> 01:07:37.571
I'll talk to you later.
I gotta go.


792
01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:05.057
Smitty! Yo, Smitty!

793
01:08:07.018 --> 01:08:08.852
Hey, Myer. How's it going?

794
01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.604
Here's the ski you called about.

795
01:08:10.772 --> 01:08:13.065
Oh, my God, what happened to you?
You're all mangled.


796
01:08:13.233 --> 01:08:14.733
- Did you get hit by a truck?
- Oh, no.


797
01:08:14.901 --> 01:08:16.610
I was trying to
ski the K-12, you know.

798
01:08:16.778 --> 01:08:19.321
After the Olympics,
everything looks so damn easy.


799
01:08:19.489 --> 01:08:23.575
You gotta be a real moron to try to
ski that run. You know what I mean?


800
01:08:24.744 --> 01:08:26.245
Yeah.

801
01:08:26.746 --> 01:08:27.955
Charge it.

802
01:08:28.123 --> 01:08:30.290
Have a nice day.

803
01:08:33.878 --> 01:08:36.713
This is as bad
as it will ever get.

804
01:08:48.226 --> 01:08:52.312
- Aah!
- I want my two dollars! Two dollars!


805
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.774
I want my two dollars! Two dollars!

806
01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:58.902
Two dollars!

807
01:08:59.821 --> 01:09:02.239
I want my two dollars!

808
01:09:06.077 --> 01:09:14.877
I want my two dollars! Two dollars!

809
01:09:15.462 --> 01:09:17.880
- Ah!
- Two dollars!


810
01:09:18.047 --> 01:09:22.217
No, I can't swim! No!

811
01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:43.447
Hi, Monique.

812
01:09:47.202 --> 01:09:49.161
Something wrong, Monique?

813
01:09:53.208 --> 01:09:55.000
Nice talking to you.

814
01:09:57.670 --> 01:09:59.796
Hell, yes, something is wrong.

815
01:09:59.964 --> 01:10:05.928
This, how you say, dorkhead,
is an unleashed sex fiend.


816
01:10:06.095 --> 01:10:08.055
- Huh?
- Ricky, he will not leave me alone.


817
01:10:08.223 --> 01:10:13.352
He thinks because I stay here,
I am his, uh, love goddess, his prostrate.


818
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.479
No, prostitute.

819
01:10:15.647 --> 01:10:17.105
Holy shit.

820
01:10:17.273 --> 01:10:19.775
You big faker, you speak English.

821
01:10:19.943 --> 01:10:21.985
But of course, 
I speak English.

822
01:10:22.153 --> 01:10:24.363
I speak very good English.

823
01:10:24.531 --> 01:10:27.157
I will not, however, speak Mrs. Smith's...

824
01:10:27.325 --> 01:10:28.450
<i>Qu'est el di?</i>

825
01:10:28.618 --> 01:10:32.579
...international language of love,
with this reptilian son.


826
01:10:32.747 --> 01:10:33.997
<i>Mon dieu!</i>

827
01:10:34.165 --> 01:10:38.377
Well, honk my hooter.
I don't believe it.


828
01:10:38.545 --> 01:10:41.004
You've understood everything
we've said, this whole time?


829
01:10:41.172 --> 01:10:44.299
Look, Lane, if you were living
with a family like that,


830
01:10:44.467 --> 01:10:47.844
the less you spoke, the happier
you would be. I promise you.


831
01:10:48.012 --> 01:10:50.055
God, I never thought of that.

832
01:10:50.223 --> 01:10:53.183
I thought if Casanova and I in there
had nothing to say to each other,


833
01:10:53.351 --> 01:10:54.893
he'd get bored.

834
01:10:55.061 --> 01:10:56.311
Go away.

835
01:10:56.479 --> 01:11:00.732
Instead, he uses it as a chance
to put his testicles all over me.


836
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.442
Uh, his what?

837
01:11:02.735 --> 01:11:06.530
Uh, how you say octopus...
testicles.


838
01:11:06.698 --> 01:11:09.116
Tentacles. "N
-T".

839
01:11:09.284 --> 01:11:10.492
Tentacles.

840
01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:13.245
- Tentacles.
- There's a big difference.


841
01:11:13.413 --> 01:11:17.916
All I want is to come to the States
and see Dodger Stadium.


842
01:11:21.045 --> 01:11:26.508
Now all I see is that face in
my door every time I move.


843
01:11:26.926 --> 01:11:28.677
Dodgers, huh?

844
01:11:28.845 --> 01:11:30.846
I noticed you have a
pretty good pitching arm.


845
01:11:31.973 --> 01:11:33.432
Well, what else is there

846
01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.102
that is of interest in the States
but, uh, the Brooklyn Dodgers?


847
01:11:37.687 --> 01:11:41.773
I don't know.
You might find a nice friend.


848
01:11:42.817 --> 01:11:45.527
You do have friends in France.

849
01:11:45.695 --> 01:11:49.156
You know? Friend.

850
01:11:49.324 --> 01:11:51.825
- Friend.
- Ha, ha, ha.


851
01:11:54.912 --> 01:11:56.538
Then you will not tell?

852
01:11:56.706 --> 01:11:58.123
That you're a Dodgers' fan?

853
01:11:58.291 --> 01:12:00.917
No, that I speak English.

854
01:12:01.419 --> 01:12:04.212
- Cross my heart and hope to die.
- Do you?


855
01:12:05.423 --> 01:12:07.174
Not at the moment.

856
01:12:07.383 --> 01:12:08.550
Monique?

857
01:12:08.718 --> 01:12:11.219
What are you doing out here?
Do you know what time it is?


858
01:12:11.387 --> 01:12:13.597
Get in here before you
catch your death.


859
01:12:14.057 --> 01:12:16.016
Jesus.

860
01:12:17.977 --> 01:12:20.020
You are my friend.

861
01:12:21.147 --> 01:12:22.230
Good night.

862
01:12:23.274 --> 01:12:24.483
Good luck.

863
01:12:27.195 --> 01:12:29.905
Is that Myer boy bothering you?

864
01:12:30.073 --> 01:12:32.908
Little Ricky's been looking
all over for you.


865
01:12:33.076 --> 01:12:36.244
We've been worried sick.

866
01:13:20.707 --> 01:13:23.166
Uh, hello? Hello?

867
01:13:23.334 --> 01:13:24.543
<i>Ah, bonjour</i>

868
01:13:24.877 --> 01:13:26.795
- Monique, hi.
- <i>Comme telles vous?</i>


869
01:13:27.296 --> 01:13:29.798
No, thanks, I already had breakfast.

870
01:13:30.007 --> 01:13:31.383
What are you doing to my car?

871
01:13:32.635 --> 01:13:34.720
What are you doing to my Camaro?

872
01:13:34.887 --> 01:13:38.557
Monique, what are you doing to my car?
It's already screwed up as it is.


873
01:13:38.808 --> 01:13:41.727
- Screwed up, ah?
- Yeah, very.


874
01:13:48.067 --> 01:13:50.110
You got my car running.
Monique, I don't believe


875
01:13:50.278 --> 01:13:52.028
that you brought my car back
from the dead.


876
01:13:52.196 --> 01:13:53.864
- "From the dead"?
- Yeah.


877
01:13:54.031 --> 01:13:56.199
No, not entirely.

878
01:13:56.367 --> 01:13:58.785
Wait. Well, can you put that back in?

879
01:13:58.953 --> 01:14:01.538
I mean, together, where it goes?

880
01:14:01.706 --> 01:14:03.915
If I cannot, I am
sure you will do it.

881
01:14:04.083 --> 01:14:06.376
Oh, no, I have
a great fear of tools.

882
01:14:06.544 --> 01:14:08.211
I once made a birdhouse
in wood shop.


883
01:14:08.379 --> 01:14:10.464
The Fair Housing Committee
condemned it. I can't.


884
01:14:10.631 --> 01:14:13.008
"I cannot do it" is your middle name.

885
01:14:13.176 --> 01:14:15.677
Come, help me push this
into the garage.


886
01:14:15.845 --> 01:14:17.387
Okay.

887
01:15:17.281 --> 01:15:19.616
You know, I think you're
kind of remarkable.


888
01:15:19.951 --> 01:15:22.118
How did you learn to
do all this stuff?


889
01:15:23.287 --> 01:15:26.164
Some things are not that hard
to understand, Lane.


890
01:15:26.833 --> 01:15:28.208
Like you, for instance.

891
01:15:28.376 --> 01:15:32.379
You seem to think up all these ways of
killing yourself, but you never do it.


892
01:15:32.547 --> 01:15:33.713
Why is this?

893
01:15:34.048 --> 01:15:36.383
Uh, isn't that kind of personal?

894
01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:41.012
But I have told you all the sordid details
of my intimate sex life with Ricky Smith.


895
01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:46.351
Heh, heh. I just figured you could
explain this dramatic death wish.


896
01:15:48.855 --> 01:15:51.481
I used to go out with
this girl named Beth.


897
01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:54.526
I really thought I loved her.

898
01:15:54.694 --> 01:15:56.820
She dumped me, and I...

899
01:15:57.572 --> 01:16:00.532
And I guess I just thought I couldn't
live without her or something.


900
01:16:01.033 --> 01:16:04.953
You would die to get
the attention of, uh, this woman?


901
01:16:06.372 --> 01:16:08.832
You know, Lane, there are better
ways of getting attention.


902
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.458
Yeah.

903
01:16:11.043 --> 01:16:13.753
Just when she dumped me, she dumped me
for this real slimebag.


904
01:16:13.921 --> 01:16:15.964
A guy named Stalin.

905
01:16:16.966 --> 01:16:18.550
Stalin.

906
01:16:18.718 --> 01:16:20.886
Stalin. I race Stalin tomorrow.

907
01:16:21.053 --> 01:16:23.054
Oh, my God, I have to get to a cave.
Right now.


908
01:16:23.222 --> 01:16:25.724
No, no. This is what I speak of.

909
01:16:25.892 --> 01:16:28.768
This is good way of getting
this attention.


910
01:16:28.936 --> 01:16:30.395
- When we beat him.
- Beat him?


911
01:16:30.563 --> 01:16:33.523
- Yes.
- I can't beat him. I can't.


912
01:16:33.733 --> 01:16:36.484
I think all you need is
a small taste of success.


913
01:16:36.736 --> 01:16:38.069
And you will find it suits you.

914
01:17:22.698 --> 01:17:24.240
Oh, yeah?

915
01:18:40.359 --> 01:18:42.986
Step up.

916
01:18:53.456 --> 01:18:54.831
Here.

917
01:18:57.209 --> 01:18:58.793
One minute.

918
01:19:09.764 --> 01:19:10.805
<i>VoilÃ .</i>

919
01:19:31.118 --> 01:19:33.244
I got these for Christmas.

920
01:19:36.457 --> 01:19:37.791
<i>Bon appÃ©tit.</i>

921
01:19:40.836 --> 01:19:44.130
Monique, I just wanted to
thank you for everything.


922
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:48.760
Merci buckets.

923
01:19:53.057 --> 01:19:55.725
Wait. I forgot the most important thing.

924
01:20:52.741 --> 01:20:53.992
Look at this!

925
01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.578
How am I supposed to
live through this?


926
01:20:57.371 --> 01:21:01.374
All you got to do is go that way.
Really fast.


927
01:21:01.625 --> 01:21:05.003
If something gets in your way...
turn.


928
01:21:07.173 --> 01:21:10.049
Watch. Is no sweat.

929
01:21:31.238 --> 01:21:33.489
Now you!

930
01:21:35.492 --> 01:21:38.369
Hell, if you can do it!

931
01:22:12.029 --> 01:22:13.404
Lane!

932
01:22:18.118 --> 01:22:20.203
Lane. Lane, are you all right?

933
01:22:23.374 --> 01:22:25.708
You're mad about me, aren't you?

934
01:22:25.876 --> 01:22:29.671
No. No, Iâ€™m okay, really.
Nothing is broken. It's just a little--


935
01:22:29.838 --> 01:22:31.047
Thank you.

936
01:23:27.146 --> 01:23:29.480
- Sorry about that.
- Ha, ha, ha.


937
01:23:36.238 --> 01:23:37.613
I'm telling you, Lane.

938
01:23:37.781 --> 01:23:41.701
Practically everybody in the
state of northern California


939
01:23:41.869 --> 01:23:43.995
is around this particular mountain

940
01:23:44.163 --> 01:23:50.668
waiting to see one Lane Myer tackle
this totally untamed slope,


941
01:23:50.836 --> 01:23:52.712
dead or alive.

942
01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.589
So get the lead out.

943
01:23:54.757 --> 01:23:56.632
That is all.

944
01:24:05.934 --> 01:24:07.518
Well, I guess this is it.

945
01:24:07.728 --> 01:24:09.228
Please hurry.

946
01:24:09.396 --> 01:24:11.314
We have unfinished business.

947
01:24:11.482 --> 01:24:13.483
Do not forget.

948
01:24:13.650 --> 01:24:15.151
Huh?

949
01:24:15.819 --> 01:24:17.195
Language lessons.

950
01:24:17.363 --> 01:24:18.905
What, you're gonna teach me French?

951
01:24:19.073 --> 01:24:21.616
The international language.

952
01:24:27.414 --> 01:24:29.374
Kick his ass.

953
01:24:37.383 --> 01:24:38.883
Shit!

954
01:24:56.151 --> 01:24:59.570
I want my two dollars!

955
01:25:00.906 --> 01:25:02.824
Oh, my God.

956
01:25:08.956 --> 01:25:10.081
Two dollars!

957
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:14.502
I want my two dollars!

958
01:25:15.045 --> 01:25:18.131
Yeah. Of course, the guy
chickened out. He's just a geek.


959
01:25:18.298 --> 01:25:20.800
Listen, the wet wimp
ain't gonna show up.


960
01:25:20.968 --> 01:25:22.760
Of course not.
So, what do you want us to do?


961
01:25:22.928 --> 01:25:24.762
- Shall we pack it up?
- I'll tell you what.


962
01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:27.348
While Iâ€™m up here, I might as well
just break one more record.


963
01:25:27.516 --> 01:25:29.976
- We'll set the synchros for you.
- 10-4.


964
01:25:30.144 --> 01:25:32.228
Okay, Spencer, we're gonna
send Roy down alone.


965
01:25:32.396 --> 01:25:36.274
- Looks like this guy is not gonna show.
- Okay, count me down.


966
01:25:36.442 --> 01:25:38.985
Oh, Myer. You don't know when to quit.

967
01:25:39.653 --> 01:25:40.945
Myer is on the hill.

968
01:25:42.823 --> 01:25:43.948
Oh, yeah!

969
01:25:44.992 --> 01:25:46.117
Two dollars!

970
01:25:46.285 --> 01:25:48.077
Go.

971
01:25:52.499 --> 01:25:54.083
Go!

972
01:26:01.091 --> 01:26:03.551
He is skiing on one ski.

973
01:26:03.719 --> 01:26:05.761
- What?
- Aah!


974
01:26:10.434 --> 01:26:12.685
Two dollars!

975
01:26:15.647 --> 01:26:18.274
There's something following them.

976
01:26:18.442 --> 01:26:20.318
- What?
- What?


977
01:26:23.530 --> 01:26:28.618
Two dollars!

978
01:26:29.286 --> 01:26:31.287
I want my two dollars!

979
01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:34.790
I want my two dollars.

980
01:26:34.958 --> 01:26:36.083
What now?

981
01:26:36.251 --> 01:26:37.960
Two dollars!

982
01:26:38.170 --> 01:26:40.296
- Get out of here. Get lost.
- Two dollars.


983
01:26:40.464 --> 01:26:41.506
Get out of here.

984
01:26:41.673 --> 01:26:43.674
Take a hike, brat.

985
01:27:00.359 --> 01:27:02.276
Two dollars.

986
01:27:44.403 --> 01:27:46.153
They're coming out of the woods.

987
01:27:50.242 --> 01:27:53.369
Come on, little buckaroo!

988
01:27:53.537 --> 01:27:54.745
Come on!

989
01:28:46.465 --> 01:28:48.007
You fiend!

990
01:28:48.175 --> 01:28:50.843
Man, you're the hottest thing
since sunburn.


991
01:28:53.972 --> 01:28:56.724
- Nice
- Get lost.


992
01:28:57.351 --> 01:29:00.019
Lane, you really are the best.
Hi.


993
01:29:09.404 --> 01:29:11.364
We've been worried about you, Monique.

994
01:29:11.531 --> 01:29:12.865
What are you doing up here?

995
01:29:13.033 --> 01:29:15.451
Do you know how long
a drive it is to get here?


996
01:29:15.619 --> 01:29:17.453
Ricky, get her skis. Come on,
we're going home.


997
01:29:18.705 --> 01:29:21.040
Excuse me.

998
01:29:21.875 --> 01:29:26.253
This is truly a sublime
metamorphosis of the Lane Myer


999
01:29:26.421 --> 01:29:29.173
I think the crowds were
expecting to see here


1000
01:29:29.341 --> 01:29:31.509
at Brodie Mountain today.

1001
01:29:31.677 --> 01:29:37.515
Perhaps you can tell us what brought on
such an enchanting, exhilarating feat.


1002
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:47.024
Language lessons.

1003
01:29:47.984 --> 01:29:52.697
Inspired words from a man
who knows how to ski.


1004
01:29:52.864 --> 01:29:55.074
You're nothing but a little
French tramp, you know?


1005
01:29:55.242 --> 01:29:56.951
I don't know what Ricky
even sees in you.


1006
01:29:57.119 --> 01:29:58.661
Whoa!

1007
01:29:58.870 --> 01:30:00.996
- What are you doing with her?
- She's coming with me.


1008
01:30:01.164 --> 01:30:03.082
- She's coming with us.
- Wrong.


1009
01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:05.918
You would be wise to do as
Mother says, Lane Myer.


1010
01:30:06.086 --> 01:30:09.380
Ricky, do something to him.

1011
01:30:21.309 --> 01:30:22.727
Aah! Son of a bitch.

1012
01:30:24.312 --> 01:30:25.396
Come on, honey.

1013
01:30:25.939 --> 01:30:26.981
Nail the sucker.

1014
01:30:28.191 --> 01:30:30.693
What are you doing to him?

1015
01:30:31.361 --> 01:30:32.778
Come on.

1016
01:30:32.946 --> 01:30:34.447
That's a boy.

1017
01:30:36.867 --> 01:30:37.908
Ha!

1018
01:30:41.121 --> 01:30:42.830
Come on.

1019
01:30:52.883 --> 01:30:54.300
Ah!

1020
01:30:57.429 --> 01:30:58.763
