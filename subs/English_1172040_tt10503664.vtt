1
00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:04.585
Hello?

2
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:10.724
Hello?

3
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.785
I need more mirrors.

4
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:53.027
Bob, I can't see!

5
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.327
I can't see!

6
00:05:55.963 --> 00:05:57.164
Bob!

7
00:06:02.036 --> 00:06:04.539
Another day,

8
00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.374
another day to start
all over again.


9
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:32.019
Hey.

10
00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:33.254
Hey.

11
00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:38.272
Nice day for hiking.

12
00:08:39.357 --> 00:08:41.897
Everyday is a nice day for hiking!

13
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.440
You're heading for the
wilderness cabin at Vihtasaari?


14
00:08:49.815 --> 00:08:51.148
Yeah...

15
00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:54.523
I am supposed be there by five.

16
00:08:56.857 --> 00:08:58.815
Maybe... if you set a good pace.

17
00:08:58.857 --> 00:09:01.023
You come up from Helsinki?

18
00:09:01.065 --> 00:09:02.148
Nope, from Oulu.

19
00:09:03.023 --> 00:09:04.148
Oulu?

20
00:09:05.815 --> 00:09:07.065
Tough place!

21
00:09:07.482 --> 00:09:08.732
Tougher people!

22
00:09:10.982 --> 00:09:13.607
Yes. I am quite sure you
will make it by five.


23
00:09:16.398 --> 00:09:18.773
Look, my cabin is over on
the other side of the lake.


24
00:09:19.523 --> 00:09:21.898
Only place around here, just in case.

25
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.898
There's a storm on the way later.

26
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:29.940
Oulu, remember?

27
00:09:31.607 --> 00:09:33.107
It's different here...

28
00:09:33.982 --> 00:09:36.148
Everything starts to look
the same after a while.


29
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.565
Yes, I think I might
have got turned around.


30
00:09:42.232 --> 00:09:43.982
I should get going.

31
00:09:44.023 --> 00:09:45.107
Have a good day!

32
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.940
Good hiking.

33
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.940
You're awake.

34
00:11:49.065 --> 00:11:51.357
You're awake.

35
00:11:52.373 --> 00:11:53.462
How are you feeling?

36
00:11:53.482 --> 00:11:55.148
You hit your head, in the storm
yesterday.


37
00:11:55.607 --> 00:11:56.907
Here...

38
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.607
I brought you breakfast.

39
00:11:59.857 --> 00:12:00.940
And some painkillers.

40
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.898
I... I need to call...

41
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.065
I think you hit your head
harder than we thought.


42
00:12:27.065 --> 00:12:29.273
Here, look up at the light.

43
00:12:32.857 --> 00:12:34.690
I told you this?

44
00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:38.107
The storm took out the phone lines.

45
00:12:38.148 --> 00:12:39.232
But I need to get to...

46
00:12:39.273 --> 00:12:40.773
No, what you need is rest.

47
00:12:44.315 --> 00:12:47.023
I was a medic. In the army.

48
00:12:49.565 --> 00:12:51.815
I know a concussion when I see one.

49
00:12:52.232 --> 00:12:53.732
Eat up.

50
00:12:58.148 --> 00:12:59.273
Emergency rations.

51
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.315
Don't worry,

52
00:13:02.357 --> 00:13:05.107
Soon you'll forget what
real food tasted like!


53
00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:09.273
What happened to my stuff?

54
00:13:10.357 --> 00:13:12.398
Didn't find any stuff, just you.

55
00:13:13.023 --> 00:13:15.023
Passed out
in the middle of the woods.


56
00:13:18.107 --> 00:13:20.148
Do you remember at all what happened?

57
00:13:23.232 --> 00:13:24.532
No...

58
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.315
I remember...

59
00:13:30.523 --> 00:13:33.982
...putting my bag down.

60
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.857
And.

61
00:13:37.357 --> 00:13:39.315
Music.

62
00:13:41.773 --> 00:13:44.773
There was a smell...

63
00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:47.273
A sweet smell.

64
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.898
And a hat.

65
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.148
A musical hat.

66
00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:00.837
I don't know...

67
00:14:00.857 --> 00:14:03.773
But that does sound like
you got hit in the head.


68
00:14:48.062 --> 00:14:50.465
The wind wake you up?

69
00:14:50.498 --> 00:14:52.467
It always does.

70
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.269
How do you feel?
- I'm all right.


71
00:14:55.302 --> 00:14:57.338
Don't get up, honey.

72
00:14:57.371 --> 00:14:58.972
I'm not sick, Bob.

73
00:14:59.006 --> 00:15:00.508
I'll make it.
- You don't have to.


74
00:15:00.542 --> 00:15:02.009
I'll be all right.

75
00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:04.546
Go out and read your paper.
- All right.


76
00:15:17.857 --> 00:15:19.565
Fuck!

77
00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:23.440
I was just making breakfast.

78
00:15:25.523 --> 00:15:28.065
How is your head?

79
00:15:28.107 --> 00:15:31.107
I... Ummm... I'm sorry, What...

80
00:15:32.273 --> 00:15:34.190
What's going on?

81
00:15:34.565 --> 00:15:36.273
Where am I?

82
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.315
We met... yesterday

83
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.332
Well, I was heading back
here when I found you.


84
00:15:43.384 --> 00:15:44.552
Sweetheart, look-

85
00:15:44.565 --> 00:15:46.607
Must've been a falling branch.
From the storm.


86
00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:52.315
I... I need to call my friends?

87
00:15:52.357 --> 00:15:53.982
They'll be expecting me.

88
00:15:55.023 --> 00:15:58.148
I think you hit your
head harder than we thought.


89
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.940
I told you this already? Last night?

90
00:16:01.982 --> 00:16:04.690
The storm took out the phone lines.

91
00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:06.641
You think you should go to work?

92
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:07.628
I have to.

93
00:16:07.648 --> 00:16:09.482
You don't remember?

94
00:16:10.357 --> 00:16:11.337
I remember...

95
00:16:11.357 --> 00:16:12.732
Sort of.

96
00:16:14.023 --> 00:16:15.440
I'm just... having...

97
00:16:15.482 --> 00:16:17.107
Really bad deja vue or something.

98
00:16:19.815 --> 00:16:23.482
That's quite common with a concussion.

99
00:16:24.148 --> 00:16:26.023
I was a medic. In the army.

100
00:16:28.107 --> 00:16:30.565
Come, sit down, eat.

101
00:16:36.336 --> 00:16:38.005
No, please.

102
00:16:40.642 --> 00:16:42.610
"The Last Man on Earth".

103
00:16:43.023 --> 00:16:44.690
It's my favourite movie.

104
00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:49.583
Don't take him away like this.

105
00:16:49.898 --> 00:16:51.023
A man.

106
00:16:51.065 --> 00:16:52.523
Alone.

107
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:55.557
Is it Ben?

108
00:16:55.773 --> 00:16:58.151
Perhaps not... the right mood for now.

109
00:16:58.158 --> 00:17:00.093
And if it is?

110
00:17:00.127 --> 00:17:01.295
It isn't, Virge.

111
00:17:02.464 --> 00:17:03.731
Is that what you really think...

112
00:17:03.765 --> 00:17:05.265
...or just what you'd
like to think?


113
00:17:07.148 --> 00:17:08.190
Come on.

114
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.940
Country hospitality.

115
00:17:47.482 --> 00:17:49.482
It's emergency rations.

116
00:17:49.815 --> 00:17:50.940
Don't worry...

117
00:17:51.982 --> 00:17:55.065
Soon you'll forget what
real food tasted like!


118
00:18:07.232 --> 00:18:11.523
You were meeting your friends
at the wilderness cabin?


119
00:18:13.398 --> 00:18:16.482
No... No, I'm meeting them tomorrow.

120
00:18:17.607 --> 00:18:20.148
A Vihtasaari.

121
00:18:26.107 --> 00:18:28.190
I got you some painkillers.

122
00:18:30.148 --> 00:18:31.482
For your head.

123
00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:45.533
Thank you.

124
00:18:45.567 --> 00:18:47.434
No problemo.

125
00:18:51.107 --> 00:18:52.565
You speak English?

126
00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:54.462
What?

127
00:18:54.482 --> 00:18:58.607
I'm an uncultured hick? Because
I live in the wilderness?


128
00:19:00.945 --> 00:19:02.170
No...

129
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.648
I was in the army. I traveled.

130
00:19:07.065 --> 00:19:08.357
Picked up a few things.

131
00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:10.398
Some English.

132
00:19:12.357 --> 00:19:15.315
The ability to live off packaged
food for an extremely long time.


133
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.940
It's very beautiful here.

134
00:19:37.315 --> 00:19:39.523
But lonely?

135
00:19:48.523 --> 00:19:50.732
For some.

136
00:19:52.523 --> 00:19:54.732
Peaceful?

137
00:19:55.898 --> 00:19:58.107
Free from temptation.

138
00:20:03.565 --> 00:20:05.898
When I came home I had...

139
00:20:06.482 --> 00:20:08.398
...some problems.

140
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.857
With addiction.

141
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.398
My uncle Jussi, he had a problem.

142
00:20:19.648 --> 00:20:21.023
Alcohol.

143
00:20:22.607 --> 00:20:23.907
Had?

144
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.690
I decided to come out here.
Away from temptation.


145
00:20:44.773 --> 00:20:46.857
And this temptation...

146
00:20:47.732 --> 00:20:50.190
Was it anything to do with
wearing women's clothes?


147
00:20:51.815 --> 00:20:55.023
Because this... 
This definitely isn't mine.

148
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.273
Your clothes were soaked!

149
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.190
Those belonged to...

150
00:21:02.232 --> 00:21:04.315
A lady visitor.

151
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.107
I'm antisocial, not a monk.

152
00:21:55.148 --> 00:22:00.315
You're no fun at all... besides...

153
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.523
But hey!

154
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:13.107
We can still get
to know each other, right?

155
00:22:22.232 --> 00:22:23.648
Gym card...

156
00:22:24.023 --> 00:22:25.565
Hiking club huh?

157
00:22:30.148 --> 00:22:32.065
Donor card.

158
00:22:32.857 --> 00:22:34.315
Good girl!

159
00:22:36.065 --> 00:22:37.523
University ID.

160
00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:42.065
"Faculty of Social sciences" Of course.

161
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:53.398
Jesus, would it kill you to
wear something feminine?


162
00:23:02.523 --> 00:23:06.898
Aha, bingo! now we can get
to know each other, huh?


163
00:23:14.702 --> 00:23:19.574
"Dear Judith, I wanted
to write and to explain...


164
00:23:22.543 --> 00:23:26.080
...and I know I should have
been at the funeral.


165
00:23:27.849 --> 00:23:31.853
After everything, it seems
like a such a small thing.


166
00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:35.957
One day after so many months.

167
00:23:37.658 --> 00:23:40.427
Just another day
to live through.


168
00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:47.434
But it was one day more
than I had left in me.


169
00:23:48.732 --> 00:23:52.273
I didn't know this would get so heavy!

170
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:05.519
"Dear Judith,

171
00:24:06.687 --> 00:24:09.624
I want to say that I am sorry...

172
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:12.760
...but more I want
to say thank you.


173
00:24:14.695 --> 00:24:17.965
I remember that first
Christmas with Amber.


174
00:24:18.966 --> 00:24:21.535
The whole family was there,

175
00:24:21.569 --> 00:24:25.039
and I just felt loved...

176
00:24:25.072 --> 00:24:29.710
...and accepted for the
first in a long time.


177
00:24:30.878 --> 00:24:34.181
I felt like I was enough.

178
00:24:41.222 --> 00:24:46.093
Sometimes I think
I was more in love...


179
00:24:47.595 --> 00:24:50.765
...with that feeling than
I ever was with Amber."


180
00:25:13.654 --> 00:25:16.991
"I could not look
you in the eyes.


181
00:25:17.024 --> 00:25:18.159
You were grieving.

182
00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:22.663
Because my first
thought that day...


183
00:25:22.697 --> 00:25:26.667
...when they told me she
passed quietly away,


184
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:33.207
my first thought was, I'm free.

185
00:25:35.943 --> 00:25:37.144
I fucking laughed."

186
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.421
No, no.

187
00:25:49.357 --> 00:25:52.357
Don't do that... to yourself. It's right.

188
00:25:53.815 --> 00:25:56.107
You did the right thing.

189
00:26:02.523 --> 00:26:04.940
This thing,

190
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.940
The writing, we did that.

191
00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.440
So we had to write a letter to...

192
00:26:14.898 --> 00:26:18.398
to someone we had lost. Who died.

193
00:26:19.523 --> 00:26:22.023
It was a group for that.

194
00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:26.982
And, it, I guess it did. Help.

195
00:26:28.107 --> 00:26:34.148
But... Sometimes you just
have to leave someone behind.


196
00:26:42.273 --> 00:26:44.065
They call it...

197
00:26:44.857 --> 00:26:47.482
...'survivors guilt'.

198
00:26:47.773 --> 00:26:49.815
It's very common.

199
00:26:55.398 --> 00:26:58.398
But... Sometimes you just
have to leave someone behind.


200
00:26:59.565 --> 00:27:03.732
Because all those things you
told yourself about who you are...


201
00:27:04.232 --> 00:27:06.190
...and what you believe...

202
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.273
They are just lies...

203
00:27:10.148 --> 00:27:11.982
...that help you sleep...

204
00:27:12.773 --> 00:27:15.773
Weapons to defend yourself
against the world.


205
00:27:21.565 --> 00:27:24.440
Maybe you're not the hero of this story?

206
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.273
Maybe you're the villain?

207
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.648
Maybe there is no story.

208
00:27:32.023 --> 00:27:35.023
No sense in it at all.

209
00:27:36.898 --> 00:27:40.357
And the best you can do is just...

210
00:27:40.398 --> 00:27:43.398
Survive.

211
00:27:48.815 --> 00:27:51.690
To survivors.

212
00:27:55.898 --> 00:27:57.732
Fuck!

213
00:28:00.815 --> 00:28:02.648
Not on her dress...

214
00:28:04.523 --> 00:28:06.357
I have to change clean-up.

215
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.690
I suppose it's about time.

216
00:28:12.732 --> 00:28:15.357
I did something about this mess.

217
00:32:32.607 --> 00:32:34.773
Is anyone here?

218
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.190
You're awake...

219
00:34:08.607 --> 00:34:13.273
I guess I knew the drugs weren't
a long term solution...


220
00:34:21.773 --> 00:34:24.773
OK, let's not do anything crazy.

221
00:35:40.481 --> 00:35:41.683
Hello?

222
00:41:13.648 --> 00:41:14.848
Hello?

223
00:41:17.752 --> 00:41:18.752
Hello?

224
00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.162
The wind wake you up?

225
00:42:07.568 --> 00:42:08.936
I'm not sick, Bob.

226
00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:11.505
I'll make your breakfast.

227
00:42:11.607 --> 00:42:13.148
It's the middle of the night.

228
00:42:13.975 --> 00:42:15.743
I'm not sick, Bob.

229
00:42:15.776 --> 00:42:16.877
I'll make your breakfast.

230
00:42:20.047 --> 00:42:21.649
It's the middle of the night.

231
00:42:30.758 --> 00:42:34.195
Look, can you get
me some medicine?


232
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.868
Bandage,

233
00:42:43.137 --> 00:42:44.705
pills?

234
00:42:44.739 --> 00:42:45.939
Pain.

235
00:42:50.044 --> 00:42:51.779
In the bathroom, maybe.

236
00:43:25.846 --> 00:43:27.014
Thank you.

237
00:43:55.943 --> 00:43:57.044
Okay.

238
00:43:58.345 --> 00:43:59.346
Thank you.

239
00:44:03.117 --> 00:44:04.318
Good.

240
00:44:19.166 --> 00:44:20.601
Do you understand me?

241
00:44:24.565 --> 00:44:26.357
Fuck.

242
00:44:27.023 --> 00:44:28.815
Fuck.

243
00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.882
It's okay.

244
00:44:34.915 --> 00:44:35.916
It's okay.

245
00:44:53.468 --> 00:44:55.369
So you finally
decided to come back.


246
00:44:56.637 --> 00:44:57.638
Good boy.

247
00:45:00.007 --> 00:45:01.208
No.

248
00:45:05.146 --> 00:45:07.248
Don't worry, boy.

249
00:45:07.281 --> 00:45:09.283
You're gonna be all right.

250
00:45:09.316 --> 00:45:10.351
Yes, you are.

251
00:45:10.384 --> 00:45:11.719
There now.

252
00:45:11.752 --> 00:45:15.022
We've got you all cleaned up.

253
00:45:15.055 --> 00:45:16.190
You're gonna feel better.

254
00:45:17.925 --> 00:45:19.960
I'm gonna put you down
here now and you can rest.


255
00:45:19.994 --> 00:45:21.262
Hmm?

256
00:45:21.295 --> 00:45:23.898
You poor driven thing.

257
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.705
Everything's gonna be all right.

258
00:45:33.174 --> 00:45:34.408
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

259
00:45:36.377 --> 00:45:39.013
Everything's gonna be all right.

260
00:45:39.046 --> 00:45:40.281
All right.

261
00:45:40.314 --> 00:45:41.715
You're going to get better.

262
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:45.319
We're gonna have lots
of happy times together.


263
00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.756
You'll see everything's
going to be fine.


264
00:47:19.913 --> 00:47:21.549
Do you know what
to do with this?


265
00:47:27.489 --> 00:47:28.722
I'll tell you what to do.

266
00:47:31.091 --> 00:47:36.096
First you need to prop
my leg up on a cushion.


267
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:40.334
Gently, gently, okay?

268
00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:45.372
Okay, and now you put-

269
00:47:57.017 --> 00:47:58.119
Okay.

270
00:48:25.245 --> 00:48:27.181
I better put it
back where it belongs.


271
00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:49.471
You are going to get better.

272
00:48:51.138 --> 00:48:53.240
We're going to have lots
of happy times together.


273
00:48:58.613 --> 00:48:59.847
You will see.

274
00:49:01.982 --> 00:49:04.351
Everything's going to be fine.

275
00:49:07.722 --> 00:49:08.923
Okay.

276
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.502
He was my friend?

277
00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:24.639
Yes, yes.

278
00:49:24.672 --> 00:49:25.940
We are friends.

279
00:52:49.811 --> 00:52:51.679
Hey, you don't belong in here.

280
00:54:27.809 --> 00:54:29.510
I'm not sick, Bob.

281
00:54:29.544 --> 00:54:30.611
I'll make your breakfast.

282
00:55:02.375 --> 00:55:04.411
Do you really
want to watch this?


283
00:55:06.413 --> 00:55:07.615
Is that what you really think...

284
00:55:07.648 --> 00:55:08.983
...or just what you'd
like to think?


285
00:55:16.924 --> 00:55:20.795
Can we watch something else?

286
00:55:26.901 --> 00:55:28.936
Listen, you get us some food...

287
00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.839
...and I'll pick
something to watch.


288
00:55:31.873 --> 00:55:33.074
Okay?

289
00:55:38.079 --> 00:55:39.914
Can you make my breakfast?

290
00:55:48.923 --> 00:55:51.324
Another day to live through?

291
00:55:51.358 --> 00:55:52.927
Better get started.

292
00:58:37.158 --> 00:58:38.926
Sick with mourning,

293
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.629
sick with fear, unable to sleep.

294
00:58:41.662 --> 00:58:43.197
He chased me across the field.

295
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:44.665
Hit me.

296
00:58:44.699 --> 00:58:46.667
Dragged me to this house.

297
00:59:08.556 --> 00:59:10.691
Have you been looking at these?

298
00:59:14.795 --> 00:59:17.565
They
can't bear to see their image.


299
00:59:17.598 --> 00:59:18.832
It repels them.

300
00:59:27.241 --> 00:59:30.111
I'm sorry that those
things happened to you...


301
00:59:30.144 --> 00:59:31.846
...but it wasn't my fault.

302
00:59:33.981 --> 00:59:35.983
Listen, I'm sorry.

303
00:59:37.318 --> 00:59:38.786
I just want to talk to you.

304
00:59:48.362 --> 00:59:49.630
Sorry.

305
00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.315
I never meant for this to happen.

306
00:59:54.898 --> 00:59:58.607
Just come back to the house.
I only want to talk.


307
01:00:03.857 --> 01:00:07.648
I told you, I had an addiction.
I honestly can't help myself.


308
01:00:08.898 --> 01:00:13.857
I'm sorry. I swear, I was trying...
I just got weak. I saw you and...


309
01:00:36.315 --> 01:00:40.023
So I tried to
control it. Best I could.

310
01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:46.940
Look at where we are. Huh? You
think I like living out here?!


311
01:00:47.982 --> 01:00:50.648
Eating the same shit day after day?

312
01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:53.773
Working for those fucking
Russian assholes...


313
01:00:54.398 --> 01:00:55.523
Just to pay the bills?

314
01:00:56.148 --> 01:00:57.448
No!

315
01:00:57.523 --> 01:00:59.982
I did it to protect people like you!

316
01:01:00.232 --> 01:01:02.523
You don't need a man to protect you?

317
01:01:02.565 --> 01:01:04.107
So you come.
All the way out here...


318
01:01:04.148 --> 01:01:05.857
...a fucking... tourist!

319
01:01:06.398 --> 01:01:11.315
Can't leave the wild places
to the wild people, no.


320
01:01:12.148 --> 01:01:13.440
No!

321
01:01:13.732 --> 01:01:15.523
You have to come out here...

322
01:01:15.898 --> 01:01:17.198
And take.

323
01:01:17.357 --> 01:01:18.607
Take! Take!

324
01:01:19.023 --> 01:01:20.440
Take the solitude that was mine!

325
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:22.982
The silence that was mine!

326
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:28.148
Flaunting yourself like that?

327
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:30.023
So unconcerned.

328
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.357
Why?

329
01:01:36.398 --> 01:01:38.482
Because men like me...

330
01:01:39.065 --> 01:01:40.357
Protect you!

331
01:01:49.023 --> 01:01:51.107
What did you think would happen?

332
01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.023
Out here on your own?

333
01:01:54.773 --> 01:01:56.357
This is wilderness?

334
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:58.773
Full of wild things!

335
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.732
Things that can track.

336
01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:07.982
Predators...

337
01:03:31.819 --> 01:03:33.488
Hey, sorry.

338
01:03:33.521 --> 01:03:36.190
I'm sorry that those
things happened to you.


339
01:03:41.128 --> 01:03:45.199
Listen, I just want
to talk to you.


340
01:03:51.238 --> 01:03:52.439
I'm sorry.

341
01:03:55.242 --> 01:03:56.443
Hey.

342
01:04:04.952 --> 01:04:06.053
Hey.

343
01:04:10.991 --> 01:04:15.863
Look, I'm not going
to hurt you, okay?


344
01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:25.540
I just need the key to my van.

345
01:04:34.482 --> 01:04:35.517
See?

346
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:37.951
Not going to hurt you.

347
01:04:37.985 --> 01:04:40.254
I don't know who did
those things to you.


348
01:09:12.272 --> 01:09:13.690
I don't know...

349
01:09:14.315 --> 01:09:15.897
Well he's not here.

350
01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:17.565
No, nothing.

351
01:09:17.815 --> 01:09:18.940
How would I know?

352
01:09:20.397 --> 01:09:22.607
Hey there...

353
01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:37.607
You're awake...
