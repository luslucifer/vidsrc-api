1
00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:23.425
Hmm.

2
00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:54.223
Uh, sorry. Sorry! Sorry.

3
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.929
You, uh, you Mike?

4
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:02.965
Yeah, Michael!
You must be Donald.


5
00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:04.533
Don. It's never...

6
00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:05.801
-It's never Donald.
-Yeah?


7
00:01:05.803 --> 00:01:07.669
Uh, I hope I'm not late.

8
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:11.740
No, no way, but let's not make
a habit out of it. Okay?


9
00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:13.342
Crazy day at work.
I got hung up...


10
00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:14.910
-Oh, none for me,
thanks. Ho!
-Huh?


11
00:01:14.912 --> 00:01:17.613
You... You...
You don't want a beer?


12
00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:18.680
Sorry.

13
00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:19.948
Hey!

14
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.383
Don't apologize, man.

15
00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:23.885
If it's a problem,
it's a disease.


16
00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:26.722
Half my friends...
out of the bar,
into the program.


17
00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:28.857
Back to their wives,
and who are we to judge?


18
00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.325
But can I tell you
something, Mike?


19
00:01:30.327 --> 00:01:32.361
Yeah.

20
00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:33.929
They're sure as hell
not as much fun.


21
00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:36.531
I just don't want a beer is all.

22
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.367
That's what you said.

23
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.902
I ju... I don't want you to think
I have a problem is all.


24
00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:42.671
I'm not thinking anything.

25
00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:46.742
It is, however, interesting that
you keep bringing it back up.


26
00:01:46.744 --> 00:01:48.810
-I just wanna be clear.
-Got it.


27
00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:52.981
But if you do have a problem,

28
00:01:52.983 --> 00:01:55.550
it's not your fault.

29
00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:57.419
It's a disease.

30
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:59.721
I mean, you wouldn't blame
somebody for having cancer,
would you?


31
00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:01.857
-No, not me.
-So, I think it's important
that we are


32
00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.793
understanding
and less judgmental.


33
00:02:04.795 --> 00:02:07.029
I'm pretty sure
we're on the same page.


34
00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:08.063
Excellent.

35
00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:09.331
Let's started.

36
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.833
-Okay.
-Oh! Incidentally,


37
00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:14.603
you and I are going to be
spending a lot of time together.


38
00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:17.039
And if I "unwind" with a beer,

39
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:19.041
you don't need
to call an intervention.


40
00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:21.377
I don't have
that particular disease.


41
00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:23.712
-Just so we understand
each other.
-No, not an issue.


42
00:02:23.714 --> 00:02:25.614
You do whatever you want.

43
00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:27.749
Well, thanking you. It's...

44
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:29.918
terrific to get permission
from the new guy.


45
00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:33.422
Mmm.

46
00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.726
Have you ever done
a draft before, Mike?


47
00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:42.030
-Uh, you mean...
-Getting new kids on the team?


48
00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:44.466
My son, Jimmy, watches
all the other kids at school,


49
00:02:44.468 --> 00:02:47.035
and he clues me in
who the best prospects are.


50
00:02:47.037 --> 00:02:49.438
But all the kids
get on a team, right?


51
00:02:50.507 --> 00:02:51.773
Well, of course, Mike.

52
00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:54.476
This is all about the kids.

53
00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:57.512
But... the ones
you'd like to avoid


54
00:02:57.514 --> 00:03:00.415
are the ones who would
rather be in Brigadoon,


55
00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:01.883
if you know what I'm saying.

56
00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:04.119
I just... As long as everybody
gets a chance.


57
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:05.587
That's all I'm concerned with.

58
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.725
Relax.

59
00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:12.761
Because your kid got one hell of
a scouting report from my kid.


60
00:03:13.697 --> 00:03:15.364
-Seriously?
-Come on.


61
00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:16.398
My...

62
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.100
Oh, my God, I'm all misty.

63
00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:19.534
That's...

64
00:03:19.536 --> 00:03:21.803
That is big. That is...
You don't know how...


65
00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:22.971
Woo-hoo!

66
00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:26.441
That kid...

67
00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:32.514
I tell you what there, Mike.
When we get to the draft...


68
00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:37.452
let me do the talking.
You just... observe.


69
00:03:37.454 --> 00:03:39.421
-Okay.
-How about that?


70
00:03:39.423 --> 00:03:40.789
Good.

71
00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:43.725
Hey, you guys, make a path.
Come on.


72
00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:55.003
Hey! Follow me!

¶ ¶

91
00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:33.001
Hi.

92
00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:34.069
Hey, Mike!

93
00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:36.204
-Yeah.
-You are unbelievable!


94
00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:38.740
You left the same time as me
and you're still late.


95
00:05:38.742 --> 00:05:40.942
-Sorry, Don.
-Okay. Hey, uh, everybody!


96
00:05:40.944 --> 00:05:43.645
Uh, this is my new
assistant coach, Mikey Johnson!


97
00:05:43.647 --> 00:05:45.947
- Or Michael.
- Hey, Mike, how you doing?


98
00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.783
Yeah. Mike's new in town,
so if you can cut him
a little slack, that'd be great.


99
00:05:48.785 --> 00:05:50.151
Okay, yeah.

100
00:05:50.153 --> 00:05:52.287
Everyone knows
how this works, right?


101
00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.857
We pick the new kids
in reverse order in how
we finished last year, okay?


102
00:05:55.859 --> 00:05:59.928
So, I guess that means
I pick last.


103
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.296
Yeah. It does.

104
00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:04.165
I gotta stop winning
that championship


105
00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.868
if I ever wanna get
a decent pick, don't I?


106
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.870
- Say, Pete, I...
- Yeah, Don.


107
00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:12.607
If memory serves,
I think your two and...


108
00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:16.211
13 record entitles
you to go first.


109
00:06:16.213 --> 00:06:18.113
So, you're a winner!

110
00:06:18.115 --> 00:06:20.148
- You're the winner, Pete!
- How about it?


111
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.983
You're still lucky.

112
00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:23.218
¶ ¶

113
00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:29.057
Uh, the Cardinals pick
Ralph Johnson.


114
00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:31.126
Oh, that's a good pick.
That's a good pick.


115
00:06:31.128 --> 00:06:32.694
-Yeah.
-Unfortunately, we, um...


116
00:06:33.764 --> 00:06:36.298
Yeah, we already have
Ralph Johnson.


117
00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:40.101
How do you figure that, Don?

118
00:06:40.103 --> 00:06:43.572
Mmm, his Dad here's coaching
the Pirates with me, so...


119
00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:44.873
he's ours!

120
00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:46.959
Actually, Don...

121
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.044
Psst. Remember our agreement.
No talking. Just watch.


122
00:06:49.046 --> 00:06:50.612
But he's on our available list.

123
00:06:50.614 --> 00:06:52.047
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

124
00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:53.782
I don't make up the rules.

125
00:06:53.784 --> 00:06:56.084
I just use them
to our advantage.


126
00:06:56.086 --> 00:06:58.653
Kids are automatically put on
the team their dad coaches.


127
00:06:58.655 --> 00:07:00.322
Why do you think
I'm with...


128
00:07:00.324 --> 00:07:03.124
Don, I know
I'm not supposed to talk,
but Ralph Johnson is not my son.


129
00:07:03.126 --> 00:07:04.993
Yes, he is, you're a Johnson.

130
00:07:04.995 --> 00:07:06.828
-No, he's another Johnson.
-Oh, give me a break.


131
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.897
-He's the only Goddamn Johnson
in the draft.
-He's not my son!


132
00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:10.265
Well, who is your son?

133
00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:11.967
Frank. Frank Nassiter
-Wise.

134
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.236
Nassiter
-Wise?

135
00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:17.839
You mean... You mean the little
hyphenate, with the glasses?


136
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:19.941
Right. He's nearsighted.

137
00:07:22.112 --> 00:07:24.679
Why are you Johnson
and he's Nassiter-Wise?


138
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:26.915
Oh. My wife's first marriage.

139
00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:28.950
Ho!

140
00:07:30.754 --> 00:07:32.187
Is there a problem, Don?

141
00:07:33.123 --> 00:07:36.057
Yeah! Uh-huh!

142
00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:39.828
Could someone help me
get the Goddamn egg
off of my face, Pete?


143
00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:45.200
Oh, ho-ho-ho!
Okay.


144
00:07:45.202 --> 00:07:47.836
- Yeah!
- Please enjoy, fellas.


145
00:07:47.838 --> 00:07:49.137
This is very young.

146
00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:51.806
While Don gets the egg
off his face, guys,


147
00:07:51.808 --> 00:07:53.074
let's continue with the draft.

148
00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:55.143
Bob, you're next.

149
00:07:55.145 --> 00:07:57.178
The Royals pick Timmy Schmidt.

150
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.647
¶ ¶

151
00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:00.649
Tell me something, Mike.

152
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.650
Are you sure
that you want to coach?


153
00:08:02.653 --> 00:08:04.052
I'm sure. I'm glad to help.

154
00:08:04.054 --> 00:08:05.687
No, no. Full, full disclosure.

155
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:08.790
I make a lot of demands
on my assistant coach.


156
00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.225
So, if this isn't going to be

157
00:08:10.227 --> 00:08:13.294
as serious a commitment
as your marriage or your job,


158
00:08:13.296 --> 00:08:15.830
then, then I suggest
you bow out.


159
00:08:15.832 --> 00:08:17.832
Thanks, but I wanna
make a contribution.


160
00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:19.334
All, All I'm saying is,

161
00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:22.103
take the night. 
Think about it.

162
00:08:22.105 --> 00:08:24.339
I've already thought about it,
Don, and that's why I'm here.


163
00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:26.274
Don't say anything. Kick it
around in your mental mind.


164
00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:28.743
Go back and forth.
Throw it up in the air,
see where it lands.


165
00:08:28.745 --> 00:08:31.746
Would you... Would you at least
promise me that, Mike?


166
00:08:31.748 --> 00:08:33.081
-Sorry, Don.
-Would you, would you,


167
00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:36.051
would you at least
rethink it for me?


168
00:08:36.053 --> 00:08:39.087
I could tell you
I'm gonna rethink it,
but I'd be lying.


169
00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:43.992
Okay.

170
00:08:43.993 --> 00:08:46.193
First practice is
Saturday, 10:00 AM.


171
00:08:46.196 --> 00:08:48.229
Saturday, I think
it's supposed to rain.


172
00:08:49.166 --> 00:08:50.465
We'll be...

173
00:08:50.467 --> 00:08:51.900
right back here
at the gymnasium.


174
00:08:51.902 --> 00:08:54.336
You can tell a lot about a kid

175
00:08:54.337 --> 00:08:56.771
the way he handles ground balls
rocketing up off the gym floor,


176
00:08:56.773 --> 00:08:57.806
into his face.

177
00:08:58.942 --> 00:09:00.075
Mike...

178
00:09:01.011 --> 00:09:02.177
Please be on time.

179
00:09:03.447 --> 00:09:05.113
Yes.

180
00:09:05.115 --> 00:09:06.481
¶ ¶

181
00:09:14.424 --> 00:09:16.357
¶ ¶

182
00:10:01.538 --> 00:10:02.804
Parents.

183
00:10:05.308 --> 00:10:07.776
Welcome.

184
00:10:07.778 --> 00:10:10.145
I'd like to take
the opportunity right now
to invite you to leave.


185
00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:14.349
This is our time.
Please be back in one hour.


186
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:27.128
Uh, Coach?

187
00:10:28.498 --> 00:10:30.231
Hi, I'm Timmy's mother.

188
00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:32.333
Um, I'd like to stick around,
if that's okay.


189
00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:34.869
Timmy has some
separation issues.


190
00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:37.272
Oh my goodness.
By... By all means,


191
00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:39.274
stay as long as you like.

192
00:10:39.276 --> 00:10:42.110
Thanks!
You won't even know I'm here.


193
00:10:42.112 --> 00:10:43.444
Just please understand

194
00:10:43.446 --> 00:10:45.513
that practice definitely
won't start until you leave.


195
00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:48.283
¶ ¶

196
00:11:03.466 --> 00:11:05.500
Congratulations.

197
00:11:05.502 --> 00:11:08.269
You are the luckiest
kids in town.


198
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:10.305
You're on my team.

199
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:13.107
Now, I promise you,

200
00:11:13.109 --> 00:11:14.576
we are gonna work hard,

201
00:11:14.578 --> 00:11:17.278
we're gonna learn a lot,
and we're gonna have fun.


202
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.981
How do you have fun
playing baseball?


203
00:11:19.983 --> 00:11:21.049
It's one word.

204
00:11:22.419 --> 00:11:24.052
Winning.

205
00:11:24.054 --> 00:11:26.855
Winning is fun.

206
00:11:26.857 --> 00:11:30.892
Losing stinks.
I hope that's not
new information to any of you.


207
00:11:30.894 --> 00:11:33.261
And I have just one rule.

208
00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:37.232
I'm in charge.

209
00:11:38.568 --> 00:11:42.003
So, when I blow this whistle...

210
00:11:47.644 --> 00:11:49.911
...you run to me.

211
00:11:49.913 --> 00:11:52.247
If you dawdle, no problem.

212
00:11:52.249 --> 00:11:55.083
Ya just won't play
the next game.


213
00:11:55.085 --> 00:11:57.285
I want you to report
to the ball field


214
00:11:57.287 --> 00:12:00.588
one half-hour early on game day.

215
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.591
And if you ask if you can
play a particular position...


216
00:12:03.593 --> 00:12:07.495
"Coach, could I please play
shortstop?" I guarantee you,


217
00:12:07.497 --> 00:12:11.199
you will not play shortstop
for five games.


218
00:12:12.469 --> 00:12:15.370
Now, I am pleased

219
00:12:15.372 --> 00:12:18.373
that most of you are wearing
the equipment that we suggested.


220
00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:20.341
Uh...

221
00:12:22.445 --> 00:12:23.611
Phillip.

222
00:12:23.613 --> 00:12:25.246
Phillip Bailey?

223
00:12:27.684 --> 00:12:30.218
Good job remembering the cup.

224
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.887
FYI, son,

225
00:12:32.888 --> 00:12:35.555
the cup is usually worn
on the inside of your pants.


226
00:12:35.558 --> 00:12:38.092
No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no!
That's, that's not appropriate!


227
00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:39.928
You can do that later.

228
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.030
Attaboy.

229
00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:45.533
Now, we all drop fly balls,
and we miss grounders,


230
00:12:45.535 --> 00:12:48.002
and we make bad throws.
That's baseball.


231
00:12:48.004 --> 00:12:49.370
Those are called
"physical errors."


232
00:12:49.372 --> 00:12:51.940
But can anyone
tell me what it is


233
00:12:51.942 --> 00:12:53.675
when we forget
how many outs there are,


234
00:12:53.677 --> 00:12:56.010
or we throw to the wrong base?

235
00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:57.078
Anybody?

236
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.246
Stupid!

237
00:12:58.248 --> 00:12:59.514
Screw-ups!

238
00:12:59.516 --> 00:13:01.649
No and no.

239
00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:06.587
Those are called,
"mental errors." And yes,


240
00:13:06.589 --> 00:13:09.223
you're gonna hear from me
when you commit mental errors.


241
00:13:09.225 --> 00:13:10.291
Hey, Coach Don!

242
00:13:10.293 --> 00:13:11.559
Hey, team!

243
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:13.594
Hey, you're looking sharp.

244
00:13:13.596 --> 00:13:16.497
Oh, look who it is.
Our new assistant coach.


245
00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:18.266
We'd about given up
on you there, Mike.


246
00:13:18.268 --> 00:13:20.468
-I guess I'm a few minutes late.
-Eleven, but who's counting?


247
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.171
-This is Frankie.
-Ah, Frank, why don't you,


248
00:13:23.173 --> 00:13:25.440
go ahead, and get yourself
a seat up in the bleachers?


249
00:13:25.442 --> 00:13:26.741
Yeah, go ahead.

250
00:13:26.743 --> 00:13:28.543
Attaboy.

251
00:13:28.545 --> 00:13:29.610
Aah!

252
00:13:29.612 --> 00:13:30.745
You okay, bud?

253
00:13:30.747 --> 00:13:32.747
Yeah, he...
We couldn't find his glasses.


254
00:13:32.749 --> 00:13:35.750
Hey, Coach Don, I got you
a mocha latte, extra foam.


255
00:13:35.752 --> 00:13:37.285
I'm not sure how you take it.

256
00:13:37.287 --> 00:13:39.988
Oh, gosh, that is much
appreciated. Cheers.


257
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.224
-Hey.
-But seeing as we have
so very much work to do here,


258
00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:45.126
I'm just gonna keep that...

259
00:13:45.128 --> 00:13:48.196
right over there.
Save it for later.


260
00:13:48.198 --> 00:13:50.365
Was it that you didn't like
the mocha, or was it the latte?


261
00:13:50.367 --> 00:13:54.769
Cards on the table, I just like
plain, old-fashioned,
American coffee.


262
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:56.170
-Okay.
-Now,


263
00:13:56.172 --> 00:13:58.339
can anyone from last year's
squad tell me,


264
00:13:58.341 --> 00:14:01.275
how many times was
former Assistant Coach Tony...


265
00:14:02.479 --> 00:14:04.479
...late for practice?

266
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:07.115
Once. That's correct,
Timor. You see,


267
00:14:07.117 --> 00:14:09.584
Tony is a police officer.

268
00:14:09.586 --> 00:14:12.086
And, one time, when he was
stopping a burglary,


269
00:14:12.088 --> 00:14:13.688
he got himself shot
in the groin area.


270
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.090
It was a sickening, bloody mess.

271
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.595
Tony was exactly 10 minutes late
for practice that day.


272
00:14:20.597 --> 00:14:23.097
I tell you this because

273
00:14:23.099 --> 00:14:25.666
if you have an excuse,

274
00:14:25.668 --> 00:14:26.734
pop,

275
00:14:26.736 --> 00:14:29.270
you won't hear a peep out of me.

276
00:14:29.272 --> 00:14:31.672
What is your excuse,
Assistant Coach Mike?


277
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.143
The traffic was unbelievable.

278
00:14:37.213 --> 00:14:38.379
Fair enough.

279
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:40.748
Cannot be helped. Unless,

280
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.484
- you allow enough time
to get here.


281
00:14:43.486 --> 00:14:45.486
Oh, boy. I gotta take this.

282
00:14:46.523 --> 00:14:48.456
Hey. Hey, Roger.

283
00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:49.524
Yeah.

284
00:14:52.562 --> 00:14:55.730
Assistant Coach Mike is...

285
00:14:55.732 --> 00:14:58.166
helping us, by demonstrating

286
00:14:58.168 --> 00:15:01.102
things that you should never do.

287
00:15:01.104 --> 00:15:03.771
Like, be late or take calls.
And I know, I know,


288
00:15:03.773 --> 00:15:06.407
a lot of you have
your own cell phones.


289
00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:08.276
God knows what your parents
are thinking.


290
00:15:08.278 --> 00:15:10.511
The fact of the matter
is that most people
shouldn't even have kids.


291
00:15:10.513 --> 00:15:13.614
They can't say no, they don't
take it seriously, and,


292
00:15:13.615 --> 00:15:16.716
"Oh gee! Why is everybody
on dope and pregnant,
living off my tax dollars?"


293
00:15:16.719 --> 00:15:18.586
My one rule is,

294
00:15:18.588 --> 00:15:21.422
if I catch you chatting
on the cell phone...


295
00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:25.760
Ah! Is, uh,
everything copacetic?


296
00:15:25.762 --> 00:15:27.428
Yeah. I just had
to put out a fire.


297
00:15:28.465 --> 00:15:29.730
Wasn't a real fire.

298
00:15:29.732 --> 00:15:32.233
-It won't happen again,
Coach Don.
-Ha!


299
00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:36.437
So, uh, I guess I should say
a few words about myself. Uh...


300
00:15:36.439 --> 00:15:39.574
-My name is Michael Johnson.
-You can call him Mike, team.


301
00:15:39.576 --> 00:15:42.276
Well, I prefer Michael,
but whatever.


302
00:15:42.278 --> 00:15:44.112
Um, when I was your age,

303
00:15:44.114 --> 00:15:46.647
I competed in a great many
curling matches.


304
00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:48.616
Was that curling,
Assistant Coach Mike?


305
00:15:48.618 --> 00:15:50.751
I spent part of my childhood
in Canada.


306
00:15:50.753 --> 00:15:52.553
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

307
00:15:52.555 --> 00:15:54.589
Which is where
curling is popular.


308
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:56.591
Now, as a 10-year-old boy,

309
00:15:56.593 --> 00:15:59.227
nothing was more important
to me than curling.


310
00:15:59.229 --> 00:16:01.229
But, honestly, now,
I can tell you,


311
00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:03.264
I don't remember
who won and who lost.


312
00:16:03.266 --> 00:16:05.233
So, listen. Now,
this is very important.


313
00:16:06.169 --> 00:16:07.835
This is about the playing.

314
00:16:07.837 --> 00:16:09.637
Not about the winning
or the losing.


315
00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:11.139
But, having fun,
and I guarantee you,


316
00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:12.573
we're gonna have a heck
of a good time here.


317
00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:13.608
Say, Mike...

318
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.660
We, uh,

319
00:16:15.661 --> 00:16:17.711
we covered fun right before
you got here. Must have been


320
00:16:17.714 --> 00:16:20.348
when you were stuck in that
unbelievable traffic.


321
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.917
So, kids, remember,
this is all about you.


322
00:16:22.919 --> 00:16:25.586
So, for example,
if you have a particular
position you wanna play,


323
00:16:25.588 --> 00:16:26.754
be sure to let us know.

324
00:16:26.756 --> 00:16:29.557
Thank you, Mike!
That's a terrific intro.


325
00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:31.859
Fellas, dive into that bag.
Let's warm those arms up.


326
00:16:31.861 --> 00:16:33.628
We're gonna have a terrific
practice. Here we go!


327
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.363
¶ ¶

328
00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:39.734
All right, lemme see you turn.

329
00:16:39.736 --> 00:16:41.702
I wanna see that
front foot step. Nice!


330
00:16:41.704 --> 00:16:43.871
Jude, you're a new kid,
but I like your style.


331
00:16:43.873 --> 00:16:46.340
Casey, nice.
You got the good arm.


332
00:16:46.342 --> 00:16:47.642
Oh, and my champions.

333
00:16:47.644 --> 00:16:49.744
How does it feel to be
a returning champion?


334
00:16:49.746 --> 00:16:51.279
It feels good!

335
00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:53.281
Oh! You just made my whole day.

336
00:16:53.283 --> 00:16:55.249
You're a leader, kid.
I like your style.


337
00:16:55.251 --> 00:16:57.852
I'm sorry I was late, Coach Don.
I... I had to work.


338
00:16:57.854 --> 00:17:00.721
You keep putting your job
in front of the team, Mike.
I mean it.


339
00:17:00.723 --> 00:17:01.923
Been a rough week.

340
00:17:01.925 --> 00:17:03.558
My company has these
government contracts...


341
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.959
Ooh!

342
00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:08.296
My company, well...

343
00:17:08.298 --> 00:17:10.464
Woo! Come on, ladies!

344
00:17:12.435 --> 00:17:14.402
Oh no, no, no, no, girls.

345
00:17:14.403 --> 00:17:16.370
Girls, you gotta wait
outside till 11:00.


346
00:17:16.372 --> 00:17:18.706
I don't think so.
We have the gym at 10:30.


347
00:17:18.708 --> 00:17:19.941
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

348
00:17:19.943 --> 00:17:22.510
We have the gym
from 10:00 until 11:00.


349
00:17:22.512 --> 00:17:25.446
-Where's your permit?
-It's in my car.


350
00:17:25.448 --> 00:17:28.249
I'm calling my dad.
He's the assistant principal.


351
00:17:31.888 --> 00:17:33.554
All right.

352
00:17:33.556 --> 00:17:35.256
Give us 10 minutes,
and we'll be out of here.


353
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.395
Line up!

354
00:17:41.397 --> 00:17:42.730
Here we go, Nate.

355
00:17:42.732 --> 00:17:43.931
Ready? Get down on it.

356
00:17:43.933 --> 00:17:45.866
¶ ¶

357
00:17:45.868 --> 00:17:48.502
That's a short one.
And, stick with it!


358
00:17:48.504 --> 00:17:49.570
Attaboy!

359
00:17:53.676 --> 00:17:54.942
Right, Timor,
what do you say, kid?


360
00:17:56.279 --> 00:17:59.914
¶ We can't take a break
from being ¶


361
00:17:59.916 --> 00:18:01.882
Here we go.

362
00:18:01.884 --> 00:18:04.252
Aah! Get down on it.
Let's go! Hustle.


363
00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:06.687
Tito, returning champion.

364
00:18:09.759 --> 00:18:11.459
¶ We waste away ¶

365
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:13.527
¶ Oh, make a change ¶

366
00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:15.663
And strongest arm.
Holy moly!


367
00:18:15.665 --> 00:18:17.398
Hey, Jude, get down on it.

368
00:18:20.036 --> 00:18:22.803
¶ I am degraded ¶

369
00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:24.505
Get there, get there, get there.

370
00:18:24.507 --> 00:18:25.906
Nicely done, Jude!

371
00:18:25.908 --> 00:18:27.408
I'm proud of you. Who's up?

372
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.377
Come on out, son. Ready?

373
00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:32.980
¶ We're too late ¶

374
00:18:32.982 --> 00:18:34.715
¶ Sold our best behavior ¶

375
00:18:34.717 --> 00:18:35.883
What do you say, Timmy?

376
00:18:39.589 --> 00:18:41.489
Here we go. Make a play on that.

377
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:42.657
Okay, stick with it.

378
00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:44.992
Great play! Next batter.

379
00:18:44.994 --> 00:18:46.560
Jimmy! My guy.

380
00:18:46.562 --> 00:18:48.062
Jimmy, show it to me.

381
00:18:48.064 --> 00:18:50.398
That's what I'm talking about.
Great glove, kid.


382
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.403
¶ Yeah, I won't have time ¶

383
00:18:55.405 --> 00:18:58.472
Nice. Who else we got?

384
00:18:58.474 --> 00:19:00.308
¶ ¶

385
00:19:05.615 --> 00:19:07.515
Make it happen, kid.
Short hop... Oh!


386
00:19:09.886 --> 00:19:11.886
¶ I'll never notice ¶

387
00:19:11.888 --> 00:19:13.087
Good play.

388
00:19:13.089 --> 00:19:14.989
Rusty! Returning champion Rusty.

389
00:19:14.991 --> 00:19:16.857
Show me.
Let me see what you got, son.


390
00:19:24.534 --> 00:19:25.566
Watch out!

391
00:19:25.568 --> 00:19:26.867
Oh my gosh.

392
00:19:28.604 --> 00:19:30.471
Kahil. Right in the middle.

393
00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:31.706
In the face, you okay?

394
00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:33.341
All right, one last one.

395
00:19:33.343 --> 00:19:35.109
There you go. That's what
I'm talking about. Good feet.


396
00:19:40.016 --> 00:19:41.449
Nice, Kahil, nice!

397
00:19:41.451 --> 00:19:43.551
Everybody get a shot?
Who have we left out?


398
00:19:43.553 --> 00:19:44.719
Frankie, what do you say, pal?

399
00:19:44.721 --> 00:19:46.487
It's all about you, Frankie.

400
00:19:47.423 --> 00:19:50.958
¶ Away! ¶

401
00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.694
¶ Away ¶

402
00:19:53.696 --> 00:19:55.396
Get down on it.
Oh, come on, son!


403
00:19:55.398 --> 00:19:56.530
Give me some hustle.

404
00:19:56.532 --> 00:19:58.866
¶ I won't have time ¶

405
00:20:07.377 --> 00:20:08.676
Well, lemme tell you
something, fellas.


406
00:20:08.678 --> 00:20:10.778
That was
an outstanding practice.


407
00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.646
There was effort all around.
I'm proud of all of you.


408
00:20:13.783 --> 00:20:16.951
Everybody go home,
except for you and you.


409
00:20:16.953 --> 00:20:18.686
No! Not Nathan.

410
00:20:18.688 --> 00:20:19.887
You. All right!

411
00:20:19.889 --> 00:20:20.988
Go on, get outta here.

412
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.661
Hey, Mike, go ahead
and pack that equipment up
for me, will you?


413
00:20:27.663 --> 00:20:28.729
Yeah.

414
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.433
You sure it all fits?

415
00:20:32.435 --> 00:20:36.637
Well, lemme see,
it did last year
and the year before.


416
00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:38.572
Hell, maybe this year'll
be different.


417
00:20:38.574 --> 00:20:41.976
See, Mike, I... I...
I have just one rule.


418
00:20:41.978 --> 00:20:45.613
You must clear things
through me, before you
go shouting 'em


419
00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:47.648
-to my team.
-What do you mean?


420
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.484
I mean, you cannot stand up
there as my assistant coach


421
00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:52.686
and tell these kids
that winning doesn't matter,


422
00:20:52.688 --> 00:20:55.089
because that is just bullshit.

423
00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:56.190
Well...

424
00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.926
Look at the big picture, Don.

425
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.931
Do you really remember
every game you won
and lost as a kid?


426
00:21:06.903 --> 00:21:10.104
When I was 12,
I batted 456 with 18 RBIs.


427
00:21:10.106 --> 00:21:12.673
We went 11 and 4
and lost the championship game,


428
00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:16.444
when Billy Nathan got
picked off third with two outs
in the last inning.


429
00:21:16.446 --> 00:21:18.646
I still think about that, Mike.

430
00:21:18.648 --> 00:21:19.980
I...

431
00:21:19.982 --> 00:21:21.949
I think about it a lot.

432
00:21:21.951 --> 00:21:23.184
See,

433
00:21:23.186 --> 00:21:25.152
I was coming up to bat,

434
00:21:25.154 --> 00:21:28.889
and if Billy hadn't
wandered off third in some kind
of damn dream state,


435
00:21:28.891 --> 00:21:33.093
I know, for a fact,
I would have driven him home,


436
00:21:33.095 --> 00:21:35.729
and we'd have gone on to win.

437
00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:37.631
I, I have...

438
00:21:37.633 --> 00:21:41.001
replayed that scenario
inside of my head


439
00:21:41.003 --> 00:21:42.770
many times, but...

440
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.774
I never got the chance,

441
00:21:47.944 --> 00:21:51.078
because Billy took the bat
out of my hands.


442
00:21:53.683 --> 00:21:57.751
When Billy Nathan ran for
school board last year, I...


443
00:21:57.753 --> 00:22:00.721
could not find it in my heart
to vote for him.


444
00:22:00.723 --> 00:22:02.690
Even though I have
every reason to believe


445
00:22:02.692 --> 00:22:04.959
that he is
a good and honest man,


446
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:07.628
who made a thoughtless mistake
when he was 11 years old.


447
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.196
So, yes. I do...

448
00:22:12.235 --> 00:22:13.834
remember.

449
00:22:19.141 --> 00:22:20.941
Well, you have
a very good memory.


450
00:22:22.945 --> 00:22:25.579
There are a lot of men
who remember


451
00:22:26.682 --> 00:22:28.148
these things,

452
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:29.283
Mike.

453
00:22:32.822 --> 00:22:35.789
Of course, it might be different
in the world of curling, I...


454
00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:37.525
¶ ¶

455
00:22:38.694 --> 00:22:41.595
Oh. You always wanna pack
the shin guards first.


456
00:22:41.597 --> 00:22:43.764
Otherwise, it doesn't fit.

457
00:22:54.242 --> 00:22:56.175
Hey, you want me
to put these in your car?


458
00:22:56.178 --> 00:22:58.746
-No, no, no.
Why don't you go ahead
and hang onto that?


459
00:22:58.748 --> 00:23:01.549
That's the arrangement
I had with old Tony last year,
and it...


460
00:23:02.285 --> 00:23:04.785
God, it worked out like a charm.

461
00:23:04.787 --> 00:23:06.954
Hey, you guys,
stop messing around
or you're dead meat.


462
00:23:09.926 --> 00:23:12.293
Is practice over?

463
00:23:12.295 --> 00:23:14.795
Yeah, you're all done.

464
00:23:14.797 --> 00:23:16.730
Uh, is this special treatment
or punishment?


465
00:23:16.732 --> 00:23:17.898
What does it look like to you?

466
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.233
Hey!

467
00:23:19.235 --> 00:23:20.968
You do that one more time,

468
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.738
and you're taking a lap around
the entire school, ya jerkwads.


469
00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.774
Well, I think these kids
just wanna have a little fun.


470
00:23:26.776 --> 00:23:28.809
Why don't we send them home,
so they can play?


471
00:23:35.851 --> 00:23:37.985
Did you happen to notice
Eric's eye twitch?


472
00:23:42.058 --> 00:23:43.824
His parents just went through
a nasty split


473
00:23:43.826 --> 00:23:45.259
and neither one of 'em
will leave the house.


474
00:23:45.261 --> 00:23:47.962
His dad's...
Oh...


475
00:23:48.931 --> 00:23:50.197
His dad comes to our games

476
00:23:50.199 --> 00:23:52.733
and yells about how
disappointed he is.


477
00:23:53.936 --> 00:23:55.803
So, when Eric's eye twitch
gets bad,


478
00:23:57.006 --> 00:23:58.672
I make him stay after practice.

479
00:23:58.674 --> 00:24:00.774
Then we go out for pizza.

480
00:24:00.776 --> 00:24:02.610
Then he has a sleepover
at our house.


481
00:24:04.614 --> 00:24:06.113
Well, that's
a real nice thing, Don.


482
00:24:06.115 --> 00:24:07.181
No...

483
00:24:08.718 --> 00:24:10.250
That's my job.

484
00:24:10.252 --> 00:24:12.953
I'd like to drag
his idiot parents


485
00:24:12.955 --> 00:24:14.822
out of the house
and beat their ass.


486
00:24:14.824 --> 00:24:16.857
I mean, gimme a break.

487
00:24:16.859 --> 00:24:18.826
In every marriage,
you're hanging on by a thread,


488
00:24:18.828 --> 00:24:20.761
and half the time, you regret
the day you were born,


489
00:24:20.763 --> 00:24:22.663
but that's no reason to quit.

490
00:24:22.665 --> 00:24:23.731
Huh?

491
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.767
Hey, Jimmy!

492
00:24:26.769 --> 00:24:29.003
One more curveball,
and I guarantee you, son,


493
00:24:29.005 --> 00:24:31.305
you will find yourself
in the spring musical.


494
00:24:31.307 --> 00:24:34.074
And nobody wants to be that guy,
Jimmy. Nobody.


495
00:24:34.076 --> 00:24:36.844
Use your head for something
other than a hat rack,
will you please?


496
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.917
Uh, fellas. Let's, uh,
let's get outta here.
What do you say?


497
00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:45.953
Let's, uh, hippity-hop.
Here we go.


498
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.223
Right, see you.

499
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.262
Roger, hi.

500
00:24:56.198 --> 00:24:58.666
No, no. Mmm.

501
00:24:59.769 --> 00:25:02.002
You need it first thing
Monday morning?


502
00:25:02.004 --> 00:25:03.771
Just 'cause that's gonna take
most of my weekend,


503
00:25:03.773 --> 00:25:05.873
and I was really hoping I could
just play a little ball with...


504
00:25:06.809 --> 00:25:08.042
Right.

505
00:25:08.044 --> 00:25:10.444
Okay, first thing Monday.
You bet.


506
00:25:14.383 --> 00:25:15.449
¶ ¶

507
00:25:19.922 --> 00:25:22.222
It's opening day
at Champions Field,


508
00:25:22.224 --> 00:25:26.360
and, folks, it just doesn't get
any better than this.


509
00:25:26.362 --> 00:25:29.229
Last year's pennant-winning
Pirates kick off the season


510
00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:31.165
against the much improved
Cardinals.


511
00:25:31.167 --> 00:25:33.434
It should be a good one.

512
00:25:33.436 --> 00:25:36.437
And here's a big shout-out
to our sponsors.


513
00:25:46.248 --> 00:25:48.382
Be sure to make a visit
to the snack bar,


514
00:25:48.384 --> 00:25:52.453
and you'll find some brand-new
food choices that are easy
on the wallet.


515
00:25:52.455 --> 00:25:54.054
Like the Monster Dog.

516
00:25:54.056 --> 00:25:56.123
Eat four,
and the fifth one's free.


517
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:02.196
Get over here!

518
00:26:02.198 --> 00:26:03.297
Now!

519
00:26:10.439 --> 00:26:11.505
Hi!

520
00:26:12.775 --> 00:26:14.108
Take the field.

521
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.009
Ah, here he is.

522
00:26:16.011 --> 00:26:17.311
Man with the bag.
Right on the button,


523
00:26:17.313 --> 00:26:19.113
if we were starting late.

524
00:26:19.115 --> 00:26:20.748
No, no, I...

525
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.082
Look, I'm 10 minutes early!

526
00:26:22.084 --> 00:26:24.084
You said the game
starts at noon.


527
00:26:24.086 --> 00:26:26.420
You must not have gotten
my one rule:


528
00:26:26.422 --> 00:26:29.022
30 minutes before game time.

529
00:26:29.024 --> 00:26:33.193
Tell you what there, Mike.
Why don't you, uh, go ahead,
and give them some fungoes?


530
00:26:33.195 --> 00:26:34.461
Fungoes?

531
00:26:35.998 --> 00:26:39.032
If old Tony was gonna be here,
he was the...


532
00:26:39.034 --> 00:26:40.534
he was the master of fungoes.

533
00:26:40.536 --> 00:26:41.935
Uh, if you'd show me
where they are,


534
00:26:41.937 --> 00:26:43.337
I'm happy to pass them out.

535
00:26:44.807 --> 00:26:46.073
Fungo's a fly ball, Mike.

536
00:26:46.075 --> 00:26:48.242
-You think you
could hit a few?
-Yeah.


537
00:26:49.311 --> 00:26:50.911
Fungoes.

538
00:26:50.913 --> 00:26:52.312
I'm on it!

539
00:26:52.314 --> 00:26:53.447
It's fungo time!

540
00:26:54.383 --> 00:26:56.817
Uh, Assistant Coach Mike?

541
00:26:56.819 --> 00:26:59.887
You're probably going to need a,
uh, a ball. Just...


542
00:26:59.889 --> 00:27:02.322
-for the full fungo experience.
-Yeah.


543
00:27:05.194 --> 00:27:07.127
Holy God Almighty.

544
00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:11.031
Okay, who wants a fungo?

545
00:27:14.136 --> 00:27:15.469
All right.

546
00:27:15.471 --> 00:27:16.570
Bases, hold.

547
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.906
Fungoes!

548
00:27:21.477 --> 00:27:22.843
This is the one.

549
00:27:30.052 --> 00:27:31.852
I got it.

550
00:27:31.854 --> 00:27:32.920
This is fun.

551
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.926
Coming left!

552
00:27:41.197 --> 00:27:42.262
Oh!

553
00:27:51.006 --> 00:27:52.973
Oh, God.

554
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:55.876
Uh... All right.

555
00:28:04.186 --> 00:28:05.285
Anybody know who...

556
00:28:08.557 --> 00:28:09.623
Take a knee.

557
00:28:09.625 --> 00:28:11.158
All right, you guys.

558
00:28:13.195 --> 00:28:14.261
Who's nervous?

559
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.166
Yeah.

560
00:28:20.402 --> 00:28:21.969
Good.

561
00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:23.270
That's real good.

562
00:28:23.272 --> 00:28:25.072
You know what that means?

563
00:28:25.074 --> 00:28:27.007
Just means you wanna do well.

564
00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:28.909
Now, it's opening day.

565
00:28:28.911 --> 00:28:33.180
Let's get this season off
to a great start.


566
00:28:33.182 --> 00:28:34.548
I need to find out
whose car that was.


567
00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:36.617
That wasn't a car, Mike.

568
00:28:36.619 --> 00:28:38.619
It was, uh, it was my van.

569
00:28:38.621 --> 00:28:40.187
That was your van?

570
00:28:40.189 --> 00:28:41.421
I'm sorry. I'll pay.

571
00:28:41.423 --> 00:28:43.290
-Ah, forget it.
-Please, I, I,


572
00:28:43.292 --> 00:28:45.392
I don't want you resenting me
because I broke your headlight.


573
00:28:45.394 --> 00:28:47.361
If I resent you,

574
00:28:47.363 --> 00:28:50.631
it won't have anything to do
with my headlights.


575
00:28:50.633 --> 00:28:53.567
-I'd really feel better if you,
if you let me pay.
-All right, fellas.


576
00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:55.435
Here we go. Tito, one knee.

577
00:28:55.437 --> 00:28:57.504
What are you doing,
sitting down?


578
00:28:57.506 --> 00:28:59.506
Tito, you're playing
short because


579
00:28:59.508 --> 00:29:01.174
Kahil asked if he could.

580
00:29:01.176 --> 00:29:02.976
Kahil, you're playing center.

581
00:29:02.978 --> 00:29:05.145
I know you'd both rather
have it the other way around,


582
00:29:05.147 --> 00:29:07.447
but that's my one rule.
All right, fellas.


583
00:29:08.384 --> 00:29:10.317
Let's go!

584
00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:12.953
-Have fun!
-Which means win!


585
00:29:13.689 --> 00:29:16.390
Okay, fans. Let's play ball!

586
00:29:16.392 --> 00:29:18.425
The first batter
for the Cardinals is


587
00:29:18.427 --> 00:29:20.994
Theodore "Teddy" Mitch Delaney.

588
00:29:22.064 --> 00:29:23.964
All right, Jimmy.
Little heat on the hill.


589
00:29:23.966 --> 00:29:25.465
Thread that needle, son.
Thread that needle.


590
00:29:26.402 --> 00:29:28.335
Play to the best
of your abilities!


591
00:29:28.337 --> 00:29:30.137
Nobody can ask
for more than that.


592
00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:33.206
We're all winners
if we do our best!


593
00:29:34.543 --> 00:29:35.976
Mike, don't say it like that.

594
00:29:36.712 --> 00:29:38.011
Strike!

595
00:29:38.013 --> 00:29:39.279
How...

596
00:29:39.281 --> 00:29:40.380
How do you want me to say it?

597
00:29:42.117 --> 00:29:43.383
Play within yourself.

598
00:29:44.486 --> 00:29:46.420
Play within yourself?

599
00:29:46.422 --> 00:29:47.554
Sounds dirty.

600
00:29:49.258 --> 00:29:50.691
It just means play your game.

601
00:29:50.693 --> 00:29:53.260
Don't try to go
beyond your ability.


602
00:29:54.964 --> 00:29:56.029
Ball high.

603
00:29:56.031 --> 00:29:57.130
But don't we want them

604
00:29:57.132 --> 00:29:59.433
to exceed what they've
already done?


605
00:29:59.435 --> 00:30:03.136
I see our job as creating
a safe, nurturing atmosphere,


606
00:30:03.138 --> 00:30:05.372
where the kids aren't afraid
to strive for greatness


607
00:30:05.374 --> 00:30:06.707
because they're
afraid of failure.


608
00:30:06.709 --> 00:30:08.508
Mike, I don't want you
yelling that from my bench.


609
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.510
Well, I'm not comfortable
yelling play within yourself.


610
00:30:10.512 --> 00:30:12.713
Well, you don't want them
playing within someone else,
do you?


611
00:30:14.049 --> 00:30:15.832
Ball two.

612
00:30:15.833 --> 00:30:17.616
All right, look alive out there,
fellas. Here we go.


613
00:30:17.619 --> 00:30:19.653
All right, Phillip,
if he hits it, you hurry.


614
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.122
Ball three.

615
00:30:22.124 --> 00:30:23.357
Small point, Mike.

616
00:30:24.393 --> 00:30:26.360
We, uh...

617
00:30:26.362 --> 00:30:28.295
don't say hurry in baseball.

618
00:30:29.498 --> 00:30:31.631
We say go.

619
00:30:31.633 --> 00:30:33.700
But, we want them to go fast,
which means hurry...


620
00:30:33.702 --> 00:30:35.335
Don't say hurry, Mike.

621
00:30:35.337 --> 00:30:37.337
These kids...

622
00:30:37.339 --> 00:30:39.706
They're at
an impressionable age.


623
00:30:39.708 --> 00:30:41.074
Okay?

624
00:30:41.076 --> 00:30:42.109
Okay.

625
00:30:45.381 --> 00:30:46.413
Let's go, Jimmy.

626
00:30:47.349 --> 00:30:48.782
Ball four! Take your base.

627
00:30:54.423 --> 00:30:56.790
Throw strikes, Jimmy!
Here we go.


628
00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:04.464
Ball one.

629
00:31:08.037 --> 00:31:09.136
All right, no sweat, son.

630
00:31:09.138 --> 00:31:10.537
We're just playing catch.

631
00:31:10.539 --> 00:31:11.571
Like in the backyard.

632
00:31:13.742 --> 00:31:14.775
Strike!

633
00:31:14.777 --> 00:31:16.610
Ball two.

634
00:31:16.612 --> 00:31:17.811
Ball three.

635
00:31:17.813 --> 00:31:20.047
Ball four! Take your base.

636
00:31:22.284 --> 00:31:23.617
Zero pressure.

637
00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:25.085
Just playing catch.

638
00:31:25.087 --> 00:31:26.586
Groove a strike for me, son.

639
00:31:29.691 --> 00:31:31.758
Throw some strikes.
Let's go, Jimmy!


640
00:31:33.595 --> 00:31:34.661
Strike!

641
00:31:35.597 --> 00:31:37.631
Ball one. Ball two.

642
00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:41.635
Ball three. Strike two!

643
00:31:41.637 --> 00:31:43.837
Take your base.

644
00:31:47.342 --> 00:31:48.775
Now batting for the Cardinals,

645
00:31:48.777 --> 00:31:51.144
Ralph "Boom Boom" Johnson.

646
00:31:55.217 --> 00:31:57.651
All right, Jimmy, you got him.
Nothing to worry about.


647
00:32:05.527 --> 00:32:06.593
Ball!

648
00:32:08.163 --> 00:32:09.296
Can't walk him, Jimbo.

649
00:32:09.298 --> 00:32:10.730
Don't let him hit.

650
00:32:11.834 --> 00:32:13.266
Throw strikes, Jimmy!

651
00:32:23.545 --> 00:32:26.113
Oh. For the love of God.

652
00:32:35.891 --> 00:32:37.891
Mike, you're killing us
right now.


653
00:32:37.893 --> 00:32:39.326
What?

654
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.200
If that was your kid,
we'd be winning.


655
00:32:53.342 --> 00:32:54.407
No!

656
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:56.710
¶ ¶

657
00:33:00.849 --> 00:33:02.516
Throw third!

658
00:33:07.156 --> 00:33:08.188
He's out.

659
00:33:10.325 --> 00:33:11.391
Strike.

660
00:33:12.327 --> 00:33:13.894
Strike!

661
00:33:13.896 --> 00:33:14.928
Strike three!

662
00:33:17.366 --> 00:33:19.866
Oh! Run it out, run it out!

663
00:33:19.868 --> 00:33:21.601
Woo!

664
00:33:22.905 --> 00:33:24.171
Oh!

665
00:33:24.173 --> 00:33:25.272
Here we go, Jude, down!

666
00:33:25.274 --> 00:33:26.373
Run it out!

667
00:33:26.375 --> 00:33:27.941
Down! Get down! Get down!

668
00:33:29.478 --> 00:33:32.546
Attaboy! Blazing speed!

669
00:33:32.548 --> 00:33:33.647
Isn't this fun?

670
00:33:34.716 --> 00:33:36.850
-Go! Attaboy!
-Oh! Keep going!


671
00:33:36.852 --> 00:33:38.785
-Keep going!
-He scored! You scored!
You're down!


672
00:33:40.322 --> 00:33:42.722
You're down! What?
Oh, get back. Attaboy!


673
00:33:44.426 --> 00:33:46.660
Now, we're playing
major league baseball!


674
00:33:48.197 --> 00:33:50.197
And we're going!

675
00:33:50.199 --> 00:33:51.765
Hit it! Go home!
Yeah, good hustle, good hustle!


676
00:33:53.468 --> 00:33:55.435
You're going around!
Roundy round!


677
00:33:57.606 --> 00:33:59.339
Woohoo! Woo!

678
00:34:01.376 --> 00:34:03.059
Hey, you didn't do
anything wrong.


679
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.743
That had nothing to do with you.
He just hit it good.


680
00:34:04.746 --> 00:34:07.547
You guys are playing great.
You guys are playing great, too.


681
00:34:13.855 --> 00:34:15.789
¶ ¶

682
00:34:25.968 --> 00:34:27.267
Strike!

683
00:34:27.269 --> 00:34:28.735
Can I point something out, Mike?

684
00:34:30.305 --> 00:34:32.305
What are we looking at?

685
00:34:32.307 --> 00:34:33.773
¶ ¶

686
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.346
Mrs. Timmy.

687
00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:41.381
What about her?

688
00:34:42.618 --> 00:34:43.717
She wants me.

689
00:34:44.653 --> 00:34:45.685
She wants you?

690
00:34:46.888 --> 00:34:48.555
¶ ¶

691
00:34:53.595 --> 00:34:55.395
Did you see what she did
when I just looked at her?


692
00:34:56.331 --> 00:34:57.981
She's eating...

693
00:34:57.982 --> 00:34:59.632
Oh, come on, Mike.
What rock do you live under?


694
00:34:59.635 --> 00:35:01.568
For the love of God.

695
00:35:02.638 --> 00:35:03.903
Strike two!

696
00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:05.872
Don't you understand
there's a whole fun house


697
00:35:05.874 --> 00:35:09.342
out there of lonely, troubled,
desperate moms.


698
00:35:09.344 --> 00:35:11.511
It's a major coaching perk.

699
00:35:11.513 --> 00:35:13.546
They see a slick guy,
like me, and...


700
00:35:14.483 --> 00:35:17.734
even you parading around,

701
00:35:17.735 --> 00:35:20.986
and they cannot be held
responsible for their minds
running wild.


702
00:35:21.923 --> 00:35:23.690
Huh.

703
00:35:23.692 --> 00:35:24.724
Man.

704
00:35:25.694 --> 00:35:26.826
¶ ¶

705
00:35:28.764 --> 00:35:30.530
Oh, if I was single.

706
00:35:32.934 --> 00:35:34.934
Ball high!
Take your base.


707
00:35:34.936 --> 00:35:37.871
All right, last inning.
Let's hold 'em!


708
00:35:37.873 --> 00:35:40.540
Uh, it's only the sixth inning,
Coach.


709
00:35:40.542 --> 00:35:41.975
This is Ripken league, Mike.

710
00:35:41.977 --> 00:35:43.043
That's all we play.

711
00:35:44.913 --> 00:35:46.613
Everything I know is wrong.

712
00:35:46.615 --> 00:35:48.115
All right, Jimmy.

713
00:35:48.116 --> 00:35:49.616
Come on, kid, you the man.

714
00:35:49.618 --> 00:35:51.785
Yeah, come on, Jimmy!
You got it!


715
00:35:54.756 --> 00:35:57.557
-You were looking at your van,
weren't you?
-No.


716
00:35:57.559 --> 00:36:00.894
-You're getting your money,
whether you want it or not.
-Stop, Mike.


717
00:36:00.896 --> 00:36:03.563
I saw you looking at your van.
I know what you're thinking.


718
00:36:03.565 --> 00:36:04.898
You don't have a clue
what I'm thinking.


719
00:36:06.368 --> 00:36:07.434
You were looking at your van.

720
00:36:07.436 --> 00:36:08.635
I'm not looking at my van.

721
00:36:08.637 --> 00:36:10.520
You were looking at your van.

722
00:36:10.521 --> 00:36:12.404
-I was not looking at my van.
-Well, what were you looking at?


723
00:36:12.407 --> 00:36:13.707
I don't have to tell you.

724
00:36:13.709 --> 00:36:15.642
I know you don't have to tell me
because I know.


725
00:36:22.484 --> 00:36:24.484
I was looking for my wife.

726
00:36:24.486 --> 00:36:25.819
- Ball one.
- Okay?


727
00:36:25.821 --> 00:36:27.354
I thought maybe she'd come...

728
00:36:28.857 --> 00:36:29.923
opening day.

729
00:36:30.992 --> 00:36:32.025
Oh.

730
00:36:32.961 --> 00:36:34.627
I guess I don't, I don't know.

731
00:36:38.133 --> 00:36:39.366
Strike!

732
00:36:40.669 --> 00:36:42.702
She might be on her way.
Traffic can be rough.


733
00:36:42.704 --> 00:36:44.604
You're the only one,

734
00:36:44.606 --> 00:36:45.972
in this town,

735
00:36:45.974 --> 00:36:47.974
who ever gets in traffic.

736
00:36:47.976 --> 00:36:51.044
Honest to God,
I don't even know
how you find it.


737
00:36:52.013 --> 00:36:53.713
Here we go!

738
00:36:58.553 --> 00:36:59.586
¶ ¶

739
00:37:05.093 --> 00:37:06.159
- He's out.
- Oh!


740
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.462
How about that?

741
00:37:09.464 --> 00:37:11.598
Tito, kid! Attaboy!

742
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.533
You are not there by mistake!

743
00:37:13.535 --> 00:37:15.902
All right. Kahil,
you seeing this? Huh?


744
00:37:15.904 --> 00:37:19.606
Could have been you,
but it's not.


745
00:37:19.608 --> 00:37:22.142
There's no mistakes. I put
my people where they belong.


746
00:37:25.113 --> 00:37:26.780
Straight up, Eric! Your ball!

747
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.590
That was a lucky catch, Eric.

748
00:37:37.592 --> 00:37:39.092
You gotta watch the ball!

749
00:37:43.865 --> 00:37:46.132
This is the season
I kick that guy's ass.


750
00:37:46.134 --> 00:37:47.434
Honest to God.

751
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.572
All right, you guys.

752
00:37:52.574 --> 00:37:54.007
Bases loaded, two away.

753
00:37:54.009 --> 00:37:56.509
One more out,
we get a play at any bag,


754
00:37:56.511 --> 00:37:58.745
we go home.

755
00:37:58.746 --> 00:38:00.980
Coming to the plate is
Ralph "Boom Boom" Johnson.


756
00:38:05.754 --> 00:38:08.988
Don, I'm sorry he's not my kid.

757
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:15.094
Oh, it's not your fault, Mike.

758
00:38:16.031 --> 00:38:17.130
Shake it off.

759
00:38:19.868 --> 00:38:21.868
Shake it off.

760
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.737
Jimmy, you gotta pitch to him.
Got to know where to put 'em.


761
00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:25.772
Come on, son!

762
00:38:31.646 --> 00:38:33.146
¶ ¶

763
00:38:39.621 --> 00:38:40.820
Strike him!

764
00:38:42.991 --> 00:38:44.090
Oh, dear God, no.

765
00:38:47.629 --> 00:38:49.028
Easy catch, Frankie.

766
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.630
Easy catch, and we win, son.

767
00:38:50.632 --> 00:38:52.966
Look at all the way
into your glove.


768
00:38:53.935 --> 00:38:55.802
Pick it up!
Hit the cutoff man!


769
00:38:57.672 --> 00:38:58.972
Frankie!

770
00:39:02.744 --> 00:39:05.245
Throw it.
Throw the ball, Frankie!


771
00:39:05.247 --> 00:39:07.847
Don't...
Don't hold the ball.


772
00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:09.282
- Throw it!
- It's like playing catch!


773
00:39:09.284 --> 00:39:10.817
Frankie, throw the ball!

774
00:39:10.819 --> 00:39:12.151
-Throw it!
-See the boy waiting?


775
00:39:12.153 --> 00:39:14.354
-See him?
-Get the cutoff man!


776
00:39:14.355 --> 00:39:16.556
- Throw the ball, Frankie!
- Frankie, hit the cutoff man!


777
00:39:16.558 --> 00:39:18.791
Throw the ball!
Oh, throw the ball!


778
00:39:21.196 --> 00:39:23.630
Oh! Oh!

779
00:39:23.632 --> 00:39:24.764
Oh!

780
00:39:24.766 --> 00:39:26.533
Oh!

781
00:39:34.943 --> 00:39:37.010
Good job, boys. I know.

782
00:39:37.012 --> 00:39:38.878
I know.

783
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.813
It's okay to cry.

784
00:39:40.815 --> 00:39:42.749
We'll get 'em next time.

785
00:39:42.751 --> 00:39:44.217
My one rule,

786
00:39:45.153 --> 00:39:46.252
is this...

787
00:39:48.857 --> 00:39:50.189
do not ever,

788
00:39:50.191 --> 00:39:51.958
ever,

789
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.326
hold onto the ball,

790
00:39:53.328 --> 00:39:54.994
in my outfield.

791
00:39:54.996 --> 00:39:57.697
Frankie, I'm talking to you.
I'm over here.


792
00:39:57.699 --> 00:39:59.866
Look at Coach Don, Frankie,
when he's talking to you.


793
00:39:59.868 --> 00:40:02.168
I don't ever want to see
anything like that


794
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.572
ever again.
Because whatever that was,


795
00:40:05.574 --> 00:40:07.273
it wasn't baseball.

796
00:40:07.275 --> 00:40:09.275
Well, excuse me, Coach Don,
I thought we said


797
00:40:09.277 --> 00:40:11.210
we weren't gonna get on the kids
about physical errors.


798
00:40:11.212 --> 00:40:12.946
Well, no, that's true, Mike.

799
00:40:12.947 --> 00:40:14.681
But I think what we just
witnessed out in right field


800
00:40:14.683 --> 00:40:17.350
was a whole salad bar
of mental errors.


801
00:40:17.352 --> 00:40:19.352
Ah, he dropped the ball.
That's, uh,


802
00:40:19.354 --> 00:40:20.920
that's a physical error.

803
00:40:20.922 --> 00:40:23.823
Yes, but if he'd used two hands,
as I instructed him,


804
00:40:23.825 --> 00:40:25.024
he would have caught the ball.

805
00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:26.659
Hence, mental error.

806
00:40:26.661 --> 00:40:28.928
Well, by that definition,
everything's a mental error,


807
00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:30.997
because the mind tells
the body what to do.


808
00:40:30.999 --> 00:40:32.999
Missing a ground ball
could be called a mental error.


809
00:40:33.001 --> 00:40:34.834
Could be, and will be.

810
00:40:34.836 --> 00:40:36.836
-So, everything's mental?
-Pretty much!


811
00:40:36.838 --> 00:40:38.905
Yes! And I sure think that

812
00:40:38.907 --> 00:40:42.308
holding onto the ball,
in right field,
and running around


813
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.677
in what looked like
a figure eight,


814
00:40:44.679 --> 00:40:46.879
while the tying
and the winning runs scored,


815
00:40:46.881 --> 00:40:49.115
qualifies as a big, fat,

816
00:40:49.117 --> 00:40:51.951
stinking mental error!

817
00:40:51.953 --> 00:40:54.687
Well, then I don't know why you
made such a big deal out of


818
00:40:54.689 --> 00:40:56.923
not criticizing the kids
for physical errors


819
00:40:56.925 --> 00:40:59.926
when you don't even believe
such a thing exists.


820
00:40:59.928 --> 00:41:01.294
Coach Don.

821
00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:07.767
That's a good point, Mike.

822
00:41:07.769 --> 00:41:09.235
Why don't we go ahead
and take that up at our


823
00:41:09.237 --> 00:41:11.304
mandatory coaches' meeting
a little later?


824
00:41:11.306 --> 00:41:13.239
Coach! Get your kids out there.

825
00:41:13.241 --> 00:41:15.408
All right, you guys. Choke back
those tears, and go shake hands.


826
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:17.944
Let's go. All class,
all the time. Let's go.


827
00:41:19.414 --> 00:41:20.680
Proud of you boys!

828
00:41:24.252 --> 00:41:26.019
Say, Mike.

829
00:41:26.021 --> 00:41:27.920
That, uh,

830
00:41:27.922 --> 00:41:30.289
that equipment's not gonna
crawl into the bag
all by itself, is it?


831
00:41:41.836 --> 00:41:44.337
-Oh, buddy. Tough loss, huh?
-Mm-hmm.


832
00:41:44.339 --> 00:41:46.873
I'm so proud of you.
You did so well today.


833
00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:48.975
Thanks, Mom.

834
00:41:48.977 --> 00:41:50.677
All right, well, get 'em
next time, right?


835
00:41:50.679 --> 00:41:51.744
-Right.
-Right.


836
00:41:57.218 --> 00:41:58.751
All right, you wanna
get some ice cream?


837
00:41:58.753 --> 00:42:00.953
-Mm-hmm.
-All right, let's go.


838
00:42:38.426 --> 00:42:41.260
Uh, I got it. I got it.

839
00:42:43.231 --> 00:42:44.363
Well...

840
00:42:44.365 --> 00:42:46.766
what's the protocol
in a thunderstorm?


841
00:42:46.768 --> 00:42:47.800
Catch this.

842
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:50.503
We wait.

843
00:42:50.505 --> 00:42:51.938
How long do we wait?

844
00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.106
Till the commissioner gets here.

845
00:42:53.108 --> 00:42:55.341
He's on a work release program.

846
00:42:55.343 --> 00:42:57.176
The commissioner's a criminal?

847
00:42:57.178 --> 00:42:59.078
That's a harsh word, Mike.

848
00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.180
He's a good commissioner,
and nobody wants the job.


849
00:43:03.184 --> 00:43:05.485
Nobody wants to be
a coach either.


850
00:43:05.487 --> 00:43:07.920
Let me, uh... Let me ask you
something there, Mike.


851
00:43:09.057 --> 00:43:11.824
How come you wanted
to be a coach?


852
00:43:11.826 --> 00:43:13.493
Just wanted to have a special
activity with my son.


853
00:43:13.495 --> 00:43:15.445
There...

854
00:43:15.446 --> 00:43:17.396
are other special activities
out there, my friend.


855
00:43:17.398 --> 00:43:19.899
I know. We joined Indian Guides.

856
00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:21.100
That sounds fun.

857
00:43:21.102 --> 00:43:22.969
Not really.

858
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:24.403
We had to go
camping in the rain.


859
00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.241
Call each other only by
our Indian names.


860
00:43:28.243 --> 00:43:30.943
What, uh...
was your Indian name?


861
00:43:30.945 --> 00:43:32.011
Doesn't matter.

862
00:43:32.013 --> 00:43:33.246
Come on, I wanna know.

863
00:43:33.248 --> 00:43:34.881
I'm not gonna tell you.

864
00:43:36.985 --> 00:43:38.417
Was it, uh...

865
00:43:40.822 --> 00:43:42.288
Chief Itchy Itchy Scrotum?

866
00:43:43.258 --> 00:43:44.524
No, it wasn't, Don.

867
00:43:46.361 --> 00:43:47.860
Well, Mike...

868
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.130
until you tell me
your real Indian name,


869
00:43:52.801 --> 00:43:54.433
I'm going to have to call you,

870
00:43:54.435 --> 00:43:56.169
Chief Itchy Itchy Scrotum.

871
00:43:56.171 --> 00:43:58.004
They weren't real Indian names.

872
00:43:58.006 --> 00:43:59.305
They're just the name
assigned to us.


873
00:44:00.909 --> 00:44:02.475
Can't believe you haven't
fixed that yet.


874
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.146
Why don't you let me pay
for your headlight, Don?


875
00:44:08.082 --> 00:44:09.115
Forget about it, Mike.

876
00:44:10.185 --> 00:44:11.384
Are you ever gonna fix it?

877
00:44:11.386 --> 00:44:13.352
Not while we're
on a winning streak.


878
00:44:13.354 --> 00:44:15.454
You're not gonna
fix your headlight
'cause the team is winning?


879
00:44:15.456 --> 00:44:17.290
Pal,

880
00:44:17.292 --> 00:44:18.591
you are obviously
new to baseball.


881
00:44:18.593 --> 00:44:20.126
Get that door and jump in.

882
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:27.934
Huh.

883
00:44:32.473 --> 00:44:33.539
Woo!

884
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:35.908
You have an animal dead in here?

885
00:44:39.247 --> 00:44:40.980
Ah, you haven't changed
your socks, have you?


886
00:44:40.982 --> 00:44:42.882
Not till we lose.

887
00:44:42.884 --> 00:44:45.151
Ah, you really
are superstitious.


888
00:44:45.153 --> 00:44:47.887
Well, I just don't
wanna jinx the team.


889
00:44:47.889 --> 00:44:50.990
You really think there's
a connection between your socks
and how the kids are playing?


890
00:44:50.992 --> 00:44:53.292
Well, it's all about believing,
Mike. That's...


891
00:44:53.294 --> 00:44:55.228
That's what the game's
all about.


892
00:44:55.229 --> 00:44:57.163
God Almighty, I never had
to defend myself with old Tony.


893
00:44:57.165 --> 00:44:58.231
He just...

894
00:44:59.167 --> 00:45:01.234
He just understood.

895
00:45:01.236 --> 00:45:02.568
One time, we're on
a winning streak...


896
00:45:04.172 --> 00:45:06.572
...he goes five weeks

897
00:45:06.574 --> 00:45:08.507
without changing his T-shirt.

898
00:45:08.509 --> 00:45:10.576
Five weeks.

899
00:45:10.578 --> 00:45:13.546
His girlfriend gets hammered,
spills a cup of salsa on it.


900
00:45:13.548 --> 00:45:16.282
He can't wear that T-shirt
to the next game.


901
00:45:16.284 --> 00:45:19.218
We get bombed 8-3.
Thank you, Tony.


902
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.420
Well, I didn't realize you had
solid evidence to back it up.


903
00:45:21.422 --> 00:45:24.423
Last year was
just unbelievable.


904
00:45:25.393 --> 00:45:27.293
We go out, plot strategy,

905
00:45:27.295 --> 00:45:29.095
have three or four
pitchers of beer.


906
00:45:29.097 --> 00:45:31.330
Really, really think
outside the lines.


907
00:45:31.332 --> 00:45:33.299
For the kids.

908
00:45:33.301 --> 00:45:35.134
So, by the end of the year,
we'd be


909
00:45:35.136 --> 00:45:36.903
sitting down at the end
of the bench,


910
00:45:36.905 --> 00:45:39.572
and we would not say...

911
00:45:41.342 --> 00:45:43.676
a word.

912
00:45:43.678 --> 00:45:45.978
I'm okay not talking
if that's what you want.


913
00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.680
Oh, hell no, Mike.
You and I don't know


914
00:45:47.682 --> 00:45:50.049
each other well enough
to not talk to each other.


915
00:45:51.152 --> 00:45:52.418
You talk to your wife?

916
00:45:57.525 --> 00:45:59.525
Yeah, not much lately.

917
00:45:59.527 --> 00:46:01.661
A cold front has
moved in the area,


918
00:46:01.663 --> 00:46:03.930
probably from Canada,
thank you very much.


919
00:46:03.932 --> 00:46:05.698
Well, the way you're thinking,

920
00:46:07.068 --> 00:46:08.534
maybe that's a good thing
to not talk.


921
00:46:08.536 --> 00:46:10.503
I don't know about you,
Mike, but...


922
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.173
for me, not talking to a woman's

923
00:46:14.175 --> 00:46:16.342
a whole lot different than
not talking to a normal person.


924
00:46:16.344 --> 00:46:19.211
I can't believe she hasn't come
to a single game yet this year!


925
00:46:19.213 --> 00:46:20.513
Why hasn't she?

926
00:46:20.515 --> 00:46:22.515
I don't know.
She's busy all the time.


927
00:46:22.517 --> 00:46:24.583
I can't keep track
of where she goes.


928
00:46:24.585 --> 00:46:26.719
But...

929
00:46:26.721 --> 00:46:30.022
you gotta be supportive
of every whacked out notion
she comes up with.


930
00:46:30.024 --> 00:46:33.125
The group, the job,
the volunteer,


931
00:46:33.127 --> 00:46:35.628
community, multi-ethnic,
inner-city, non-denominational,


932
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.430
blahdity-blah-blah...

933
00:46:39.233 --> 00:46:42.034
all of which, I respect.

934
00:46:48.009 --> 00:46:50.676
Time goes by
and here we are.


935
00:46:50.678 --> 00:46:53.212
Two guys eating
cookies in the rain.


936
00:46:56.718 --> 00:46:58.684
I haven't even met your wife.
I don't even know her name.


937
00:47:01.456 --> 00:47:03.155
-Barbara.
-Ha!


938
00:47:04.492 --> 00:47:08.327
That... That is unbelievable.

939
00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:11.030
-What, what's unbelievable?
-We're eight games
into the season,


940
00:47:11.032 --> 00:47:12.631
I haven't even met Babs.

941
00:47:12.633 --> 00:47:14.266
Give me a break.
I tell you what!


942
00:47:14.268 --> 00:47:17.303
What do you say you,
me, and Babs,


943
00:47:17.305 --> 00:47:19.372
we go out for...
And I know you don't like beer.


944
00:47:19.374 --> 00:47:21.707
You have your reasons.
This is not a criticism.


945
00:47:24.078 --> 00:47:26.312
What about Babs?
What does she go for?


946
00:47:26.314 --> 00:47:28.247
A little wine cooler?

947
00:47:28.249 --> 00:47:30.082
That her flavor? Huh?

948
00:47:30.084 --> 00:47:31.617
Is that the, the commissioner?

949
00:47:31.619 --> 00:47:33.386
The guy with the thing
on his ankle?


950
00:47:33.388 --> 00:47:34.453
Oh!

951
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.610
All right, you guys.

952
00:47:40.611 --> 00:47:42.461
Now we are riding
a six-game winning streak.


953
00:47:42.463 --> 00:47:46.265
Today, there is no reason
not to make it seven.


954
00:47:46.267 --> 00:47:47.533
Okay?

955
00:47:47.535 --> 00:47:49.502
Go Pirates on three.
One, two, three.


956
00:47:49.504 --> 00:47:52.571
Go Pirates!

957
00:47:54.841 --> 00:47:57.108
Here we go, Trusty Rusty.
What do you say, kid?


958
00:47:57.111 --> 00:48:00.112
I like our chances here.
Let's find a way to contribute!


959
00:48:01.449 --> 00:48:03.416
Say, Rusty kid.

960
00:48:03.418 --> 00:48:05.317
Dead on.
That's what I'm talking about!


961
00:48:05.319 --> 00:48:07.820
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

962
00:48:07.822 --> 00:48:09.355
Come on, kid, pick 'em up,
put 'em down!


963
00:48:09.357 --> 00:48:10.823
Pick 'em up, put 'em down!

964
00:48:10.825 --> 00:48:12.324
Come on, blue!

965
00:48:24.372 --> 00:48:25.771
Oh! Run!

966
00:48:25.773 --> 00:48:27.773
Good hustle, Jimmy!

967
00:48:27.775 --> 00:48:30.109
Attaboy! Yeah, attaboy.

968
00:48:30.111 --> 00:48:31.477
Way to make something happen!

969
00:48:32.413 --> 00:48:33.779
Come on, let's go, Jimmy.

970
00:48:33.781 --> 00:48:34.847
Come on, Jimmy.

971
00:48:37.652 --> 00:48:38.784
Don't drop it, Eric.

972
00:48:38.786 --> 00:48:40.686
Don't drop it, don't dro... Oh!

973
00:48:42.123 --> 00:48:43.489
Hey, I got great news, Eric.

974
00:48:43.491 --> 00:48:46.125
There's still time to sign up
for girls' softball.


975
00:48:46.127 --> 00:48:47.760
I'm sure your mother
would love that.


976
00:48:47.762 --> 00:48:50.496
Hey, everybody, that's my son.
He dropped the ball.


977
00:48:50.498 --> 00:48:51.864
Way to go, son.

978
00:48:58.706 --> 00:49:01.607
Stepping into the batter's box
for the Royals,


979
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:03.409
Bubba Glen.

980
00:49:08.316 --> 00:49:09.448
Strike three, you're out!

981
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:17.656
Here we go, Pirates.

982
00:49:20.461 --> 00:49:22.761
Come on! You got this!

983
00:49:22.763 --> 00:49:24.563
Be part of the solution, kid.

984
00:49:28.336 --> 00:49:29.535
Safe!

985
00:49:32.173 --> 00:49:34.173
Damn it, don't let him go!

986
00:49:34.175 --> 00:49:35.241
Safe!

987
00:49:38.146 --> 00:49:40.446
Hey, Ump, are high school
seniors allowed to play?


988
00:49:45.887 --> 00:49:48.787
Take it! Pick the ball up!
Come on, now!


989
00:49:49.724 --> 00:49:50.789
Out!

990
00:49:50.791 --> 00:49:53.392
Yeah! That's my son! Yeah!

991
00:49:53.394 --> 00:49:55.427
Yeah! Way to go, Timmy!

992
00:50:01.402 --> 00:50:02.735
Good job! Run!

993
00:50:02.737 --> 00:50:04.170
Yeah!

994
00:50:15.249 --> 00:50:16.282
Yeah!

995
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:20.519
Oh, what are you looking at?

996
00:50:20.521 --> 00:50:21.687
For goodness sake.

997
00:50:22.757 --> 00:50:24.757
Attaboy, Timor. Attaboy.

998
00:50:26.761 --> 00:50:28.360
¶ ¶

999
00:50:29.897 --> 00:50:31.664
Now pitching for the Royals,

1000
00:50:31.666 --> 00:50:32.898
Burt Shilling.

1001
00:50:36.737 --> 00:50:39.371
Hey, blue? One second.
Just one second.


1002
00:50:39.373 --> 00:50:41.373
How, uh...

1003
00:50:41.375 --> 00:50:42.875
How old would you say
the pitcher is?


1004
00:50:43.811 --> 00:50:44.843
Twelve.

1005
00:50:44.845 --> 00:50:46.412
Do you know he drove
to the game,


1006
00:50:46.414 --> 00:50:48.347
-and he hangs out
at the VFW, Ump?
-Let's play ball!


1007
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:49.715
Honest to God, blue,

1008
00:50:49.717 --> 00:50:51.417
someone should check
his birth certificate.


1009
00:50:51.419 --> 00:50:53.285
This is all
about the kids, blue.


1010
00:50:53.287 --> 00:50:54.720
It's not all about
the young adults!


1011
00:50:54.722 --> 00:50:56.455
He can't help his size.

1012
00:50:56.457 --> 00:50:57.656
All right, here we go,
Frankie kid.


1013
00:50:57.658 --> 00:50:59.325
Let's get a little
something going today.


1014
00:50:59.327 --> 00:51:00.826
Hey hey, attaboy.

1015
00:51:00.828 --> 00:51:02.628
That's my baseball player.

1016
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:03.996
You know what I smell?

1017
00:51:03.998 --> 00:51:06.298
A hit, Frankie. 
I smell a hit.

1018
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.366
Here we go, kid.

1019
00:51:07.368 --> 00:51:08.867
Stay in. Stay in.

1020
00:51:11.739 --> 00:51:13.772
-Ball!
-Oh, Frankie! Frankie!


1021
00:51:13.774 --> 00:51:16.942
You're bailing.
I want you to plant it and turn.


1022
00:51:16.944 --> 00:51:18.944
Right now, you're acting like
you're a little scared.


1023
00:51:18.946 --> 00:51:20.779
And I know you're not
'cause it's Frankie Day.


1024
00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:22.581
He is not gonna hit you, kid.

1025
00:51:22.583 --> 00:51:23.916
Stay in there.
Listen to Coach Don.


1026
00:51:23.918 --> 00:51:26.518
He is not gonna hit you.
Here we go.


1027
00:51:32.627 --> 00:51:33.892
- Time!
- Oh!


1028
00:51:33.894 --> 00:51:36.362
Oh! Dear God.

1029
00:51:36.364 --> 00:51:38.764
You okay?
You all right, buddy?
Come on.


1030
00:51:38.766 --> 00:51:39.999
All right, pal.

1031
00:51:40.001 --> 00:51:41.634
You okay, buddy?

1032
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:47.573
All right. Way to use your head.

1033
00:51:47.575 --> 00:51:49.642
Attaboy, attaboy.

1034
00:51:49.644 --> 00:51:51.627
Way to tough it out.

1035
00:51:51.628 --> 00:51:53.611
That slight ringing sensation
you have in your ear,


1036
00:51:53.614 --> 00:51:55.381
that's perfectly natural
right now.


1037
00:51:57.918 --> 00:51:59.451
Here's the situation.

1038
00:51:59.453 --> 00:52:03.055
I got one away.
You are my tying run, okay?


1039
00:52:03.057 --> 00:52:04.623
If that ball's in the ground,

1040
00:52:04.625 --> 00:52:06.458
I want you to hippity-hop
to the barbershop.


1041
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.027
You understand? 
All right, good.

1042
00:52:08.029 --> 00:52:10.429
All right, Kahil.
Get that elbow up!


1043
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:12.765
Frankie, one, two, three,
look at me.


1044
00:52:12.767 --> 00:52:14.366
What do we say?
We get what we get...


1045
00:52:14.368 --> 00:52:15.434
and we don't fret.

1046
00:52:15.436 --> 00:52:17.236
That's right.
If you need to cry,


1047
00:52:17.237 --> 00:52:19.037
I want you to wait till the end
of the inning. You understand?


1048
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.690
-Mm-hmm.
-All right, kid.


1049
00:52:20.691 --> 00:52:22.341
Gimme two steps.
One, two. There you go.


1050
00:52:23.077 --> 00:52:24.343
Here we go!

1051
00:52:24.345 --> 00:52:25.411
¶ ¶

1052
00:52:28.783 --> 00:52:29.982
Run, Frankie, run!

1053
00:52:29.984 --> 00:52:31.517
Don't watch the ball!
It's gonna drop!


1054
00:52:31.519 --> 00:52:33.419
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1055
00:52:35.056 --> 00:52:36.955
-Oh, Frankie!
-Oh! Oh!


1056
00:52:36.957 --> 00:52:38.791
Frankie, get back!

1057
00:52:38.793 --> 00:52:40.693
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! Back!


1058
00:52:40.695 --> 00:52:42.661
Frankie, get back! Get back!
Get back! Get back!


1059
00:52:42.663 --> 00:52:45.030
Don't get doubled up!
Get down! Get down!


1060
00:52:45.032 --> 00:52:46.799
Get down! Get down!

1061
00:52:47.835 --> 00:52:48.901
- Ugh!
- Ball game!


1062
00:52:48.903 --> 00:52:50.469
Oh!

1063
00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:53.706
Gah!

1064
00:52:53.708 --> 00:52:54.873
Good game, everybody.

1065
00:52:58.079 --> 00:52:59.611
My fault.

1066
00:52:59.613 --> 00:53:00.746
Okay?

1067
00:53:00.748 --> 00:53:02.614
My fault.

1068
00:53:02.616 --> 00:53:03.749
Gah!

1069
00:53:06.454 --> 00:53:07.820
Line up. Shake hands.

1070
00:53:08.756 --> 00:53:10.022
Here we go.

1071
00:53:10.024 --> 00:53:11.724
Hey, quick question, Don.

1072
00:53:11.726 --> 00:53:13.826
Was that a physical error
or a mental error?


1073
00:53:13.828 --> 00:53:16.628
Well, I guess since you weren't
out on the field,
it couldn't be a physical error.


1074
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:17.896
So it must have been a mental.

1075
00:53:17.898 --> 00:53:19.398
Shut up, Mike.

1076
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.533
I exercised poor judgment
and I let down the team.


1077
00:53:21.535 --> 00:53:23.902
Oh, come on, it's our first loss
since opening day.


1078
00:53:23.904 --> 00:53:24.970
Everybody played great.

1079
00:53:24.972 --> 00:53:26.939
Except you.
You didn't even play!


1080
00:53:26.941 --> 00:53:28.774
What the hell is wrong with you?

1081
00:53:28.776 --> 00:53:30.843
I'm just trying to be a pal.
Cheer you up.


1082
00:53:30.845 --> 00:53:33.579
Well, stop it.

1083
00:53:33.581 --> 00:53:35.781
What kind of man are you,
losing doesn't bother you?


1084
00:53:35.783 --> 00:53:37.883
Tell me... Tell me something.

1085
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.754
-Why are you here?
-What?


1086
00:53:41.756 --> 00:53:43.455
Making fun of me.

1087
00:53:43.457 --> 00:53:44.890
Making fun of the game
of baseball.


1088
00:53:44.892 --> 00:53:46.492
I am not making fun.

1089
00:53:46.494 --> 00:53:49.695
I, I am just...
I'm thrilled to be here.


1090
00:53:49.697 --> 00:53:50.929
To be a part of this.

1091
00:53:50.931 --> 00:53:52.931
I was the kid
who never got picked.


1092
00:53:52.933 --> 00:53:54.566
Ended up watching
from the sidelines.


1093
00:53:54.568 --> 00:53:56.535
I don't want Frankie to be
the kid who never gets picked.


1094
00:53:56.537 --> 00:53:58.437
That's why I'm here.

1095
00:53:58.439 --> 00:54:01.907
I hope this is a rich
and fulfilling experience,


1096
00:54:01.909 --> 00:54:03.008
for the both of you.

1097
00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:05.911
You know,
you don't own baseball, Don.


1098
00:54:05.913 --> 00:54:08.080
Let me and my kid have
a little piece of it, okay?


1099
00:54:10.484 --> 00:54:12.551
¶ ¶

1100
00:54:24.532 --> 00:54:25.798
You seen the other shin guard?

1101
00:54:26.834 --> 00:54:28.167
God, I do everything
around here.


1102
00:54:29.103 --> 00:54:30.803
And not for nothing, but...

1103
00:54:30.805 --> 00:54:33.705
who else brought snacks
this year?


1104
00:54:33.707 --> 00:54:36.942
Answer. Nobody.

1105
00:54:36.944 --> 00:54:38.844
Well, I didn't know you were
bringing all the snacks.


1106
00:54:38.846 --> 00:54:40.579
Well, now you do.

1107
00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:43.849
Snacks are an integral part of
these kids' baseball experience.


1108
00:54:43.851 --> 00:54:45.684
Let me ask you something there,
Mike. How come...


1109
00:54:47.087 --> 00:54:49.955
you never bring snacks?

1110
00:54:49.957 --> 00:54:52.658
I mean, I accept that
you are damn sure


1111
00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.461
not gonna come up with
any brilliant game strategies,


1112
00:54:55.463 --> 00:54:58.897
but how about a little word
across the pillow to Babs


1113
00:54:58.899 --> 00:55:01.099
that just
the littlest contribution


1114
00:55:01.101 --> 00:55:04.169
-would be very
greatly appreciated.
-Her name's Barbara.


1115
00:55:04.171 --> 00:55:07.673
If she doesn't want to come
to a single game
all season, fine.


1116
00:55:07.675 --> 00:55:09.041
I don't judge someone's

1117
00:55:09.043 --> 00:55:11.610
lack of interest
in their own kid. But...


1118
00:55:11.612 --> 00:55:14.480
oh my goodness, at least
she could go to a grocery store,


1119
00:55:14.482 --> 00:55:15.881
and maybe pick up some crap

1120
00:55:15.883 --> 00:55:17.816
and show the kids
we really care.


1121
00:55:17.818 --> 00:55:19.485
My wife's dead, Don.

1122
00:55:19.487 --> 00:55:20.886
What?

1123
00:55:21.822 --> 00:55:23.889
Barbara, my wife.

1124
00:55:24.825 --> 00:55:25.958
She's dead.

1125
00:55:27.928 --> 00:55:30.529
What are you talking about?
When did this happen?


1126
00:55:30.531 --> 00:55:32.531
Oh, year ago.

1127
00:55:35.236 --> 00:55:36.902
Babs is dead,

1128
00:55:36.904 --> 00:55:39.505
and I didn't even
get to meet her.


1129
00:55:39.507 --> 00:55:42.207
I'll bring snacks
to the next game.


1130
00:55:42.209 --> 00:55:43.542
I didn't know I was supposed to.

1131
00:55:43.544 --> 00:55:45.143
Oh now, Jesus Christ, Mikey!

1132
00:55:45.145 --> 00:55:47.012
And don't call me Mikey!

1133
00:55:47.014 --> 00:55:48.080
Or Mike.

1134
00:55:48.082 --> 00:55:49.581
My name's Michael.

1135
00:55:49.583 --> 00:55:50.849
All right?
Is that too much to ask?


1136
00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:52.551
Well, why couldn't you
tell me about your wife?


1137
00:55:52.553 --> 00:55:54.019
'Cause I didn't wanna
tell you about my wife!


1138
00:55:54.021 --> 00:55:55.554
I just wanted to be
the assistant coach!


1139
00:55:55.556 --> 00:55:58.090
Oh, I see.
So, I can just ramble on,


1140
00:55:58.092 --> 00:56:00.092
like some kind of
five-star asshole


1141
00:56:00.094 --> 00:56:02.044
about how she should
bring snacks,


1142
00:56:02.045 --> 00:56:03.995
and maybe we should, we should
go out for wine coolers.


1143
00:56:03.998 --> 00:56:05.230
It's okay.

1144
00:56:05.232 --> 00:56:07.599
Yeah, it's okay for you!
I feel like a jerk!


1145
00:56:07.601 --> 00:56:09.134
Listen, Mike, Mikey...

1146
00:56:10.304 --> 00:56:12.237
Michael!

1147
00:56:12.238 --> 00:56:14.171
If you keep it all bottled up
in this ball of stress,


1148
00:56:14.174 --> 00:56:16.808
it is going to build
and it is going to build,


1149
00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:18.043
and then one day...

1150
00:56:18.045 --> 00:56:19.678
...it's going to explode,

1151
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.647
and it will kill you.

1152
00:56:21.649 --> 00:56:22.748
That's none of my business.

1153
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:25.050
I don't judge.
The real question is,


1154
00:56:25.052 --> 00:56:28.620
how am I supposed to know
who the guy is sitting
next to me on the bench?


1155
00:56:28.622 --> 00:56:32.057
-I told you.
-It only took you eight games.


1156
00:56:32.059 --> 00:56:35.060
About the only time
I don't think about her
is when I'm here.


1157
00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:38.263
And I'm tired, Don.

1158
00:56:39.667 --> 00:56:40.732
I need a break.

1159
00:56:47.942 --> 00:56:49.174
Where's Frank's father?

1160
00:56:49.176 --> 00:56:50.609
Nepal.

1161
00:56:51.645 --> 00:56:53.211
Nepal? The...

1162
00:56:54.148 --> 00:56:55.247
The one in Nepal?

1163
00:56:55.249 --> 00:56:56.815
That's the one.

1164
00:56:56.817 --> 00:56:58.317
Been on a pilgrimage
for seven years.


1165
00:56:58.319 --> 00:57:01.186
Man...

1166
00:57:01.188 --> 00:57:02.888
I'd like to go on
a damn pilgrimage.


1167
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:04.957
Where do I sign up
for my pilgrimage?


1168
00:57:04.959 --> 00:57:07.326
So, I'm Frankie's dad.

1169
00:57:10.164 --> 00:57:11.630
Well, that's good.

1170
00:57:11.632 --> 00:57:13.899
He's a smart kid.

1171
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:15.300
Why do you say that though?

1172
00:57:15.302 --> 00:57:17.636
I mean, he's never picked up
a drill on the first try.


1173
00:57:17.638 --> 00:57:19.905
He doesn't even know
what a cutoff man is. Still.


1174
00:57:19.907 --> 00:57:22.374
I, I don't know.

1175
00:57:22.376 --> 00:57:24.943
Maybe it's the glasses
or the way he always
walks around.


1176
00:57:24.945 --> 00:57:26.979
I, I, I don't know.
He just seems like a smart...


1177
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:29.881
Wh... wh... why is everything
such a big mystery with you?


1178
00:57:29.883 --> 00:57:31.984
Your dead wife.
Your kid's father.


1179
00:57:31.986 --> 00:57:33.118
Your real Indian name.

1180
00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.621
-Where is Frankie?
-Just...


1181
00:57:37.958 --> 00:57:39.324
Oh, he's already in the car.

1182
00:57:48.869 --> 00:57:50.769
¶ ¶

1183
00:57:51.805 --> 00:57:53.772
You can do this, Jimmy.

1184
00:58:05.819 --> 00:58:08.353
Attaboy! Here we go!

1185
00:58:08.355 --> 00:58:09.988
Complete game, Jimmy.
Complete game.


1186
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:11.089
What do you say, kid?

1187
00:58:14.261 --> 00:58:15.327
Strike!

1188
00:58:15.329 --> 00:58:17.362
Got your back, Jimmy!

1189
00:58:25.406 --> 00:58:26.672
He's out!

1190
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.179
Got it!

1191
00:58:34.181 --> 00:58:35.247
He gone!

1192
00:58:35.249 --> 00:58:36.715
Tito!

1193
00:58:36.717 --> 00:58:38.316
Attaboy!

1194
00:58:38.318 --> 00:58:40.285
Come on, Tito. Come on, Tito.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.


1195
00:58:41.221 --> 00:58:43.955
Oh! Stay down, stay down.

1196
00:58:43.957 --> 00:58:46.858
Nice hustle! Come on,
you kidding?


1197
00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.393
Way to hustle, kid!

1198
00:58:48.395 --> 00:58:49.795
Come on, Eric!

1199
00:58:49.797 --> 00:58:50.862
Come on, Eric kid!

1200
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.199
Attaboy!

1201
00:58:54.201 --> 00:58:56.401
- Nice hit!
- Woo!


1202
00:58:56.403 --> 00:58:58.737
- Go, get there, get there!
- Run it out!


1203
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.173
You got it, you got it!

1204
00:59:01.175 --> 00:59:03.275
Attaboy! Attaboy! Attaboy!

1205
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:05.844
- Attaboy!
- Woo!


1206
00:59:14.421 --> 00:59:16.822
¶ ¶

1207
00:59:16.824 --> 00:59:18.023
Come on, Jimmy!

1208
00:59:20.194 --> 00:59:22.127
-Strike!
-Attaboy!


1209
00:59:22.129 --> 00:59:24.162
Attaboy, Jimmy.
You're pitching a gem here.


1210
00:59:24.164 --> 00:59:26.264
You never looked better.
You're throwing aspirin.


1211
00:59:26.266 --> 00:59:27.799
It's blue smoke out there, baby.

1212
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:30.936
Strike two!

1213
00:59:30.938 --> 00:59:32.370
Oh my goodness gracious.

1214
00:59:32.372 --> 00:59:34.740
Jimmy's just
an unbelievable talent.


1215
00:59:34.742 --> 00:59:36.274
I've never been
prouder of you, Jimmy.


1216
00:59:36.276 --> 00:59:37.809
You have never looked better!

1217
00:59:37.811 --> 00:59:39.111
Come on, son, here we go!

1218
00:59:39.113 --> 00:59:40.445
Shut 'er down!

1219
00:59:40.447 --> 00:59:42.047
You strike him out, Jimmy!

1220
00:59:44.485 --> 00:59:45.917
Got him!

1221
00:59:47.187 --> 00:59:48.887
Way to go, Pirates.

1222
00:59:48.889 --> 00:59:50.856
Great win.

1223
00:59:50.858 --> 00:59:53.125
Bring it in, fellas.
Bring it in, fellas.


1224
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:57.529
Go Pirates on three.
One, two, three.


1225
00:59:57.531 --> 01:00:00.065
Go Pirates!

1226
01:00:00.067 --> 01:00:01.099
Yeah!

1227
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:02.434
All right, line up
and shake hands!


1228
01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:08.073
¶ ¶

1229
01:00:16.483 --> 01:00:17.516
Hey, buddy.

1230
01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.853
What's on your mind?

1231
01:00:23.123 --> 01:00:24.289
Well...

1232
01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.343
I was thinking.

1233
01:00:28.344 --> 01:00:30.127
There's only maybe
three kids on our team


1234
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.863
who can make it
to the Majors someday.


1235
01:00:33.433 --> 01:00:35.167
Jimmy,

1236
01:00:35.169 --> 01:00:36.535
Eric,

1237
01:00:36.537 --> 01:00:38.103
and Timor.

1238
01:00:40.974 --> 01:00:43.208
You... You think
I'll ever get a hit?


1239
01:00:45.445 --> 01:00:47.979
All I know is
you get better every day, Champ.


1240
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:50.382
Yeah?

1241
01:00:52.152 --> 01:00:53.318
Wanna play some catch?

1242
01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.953
-Sure.
-Here.


1243
01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:55.987
Let's practice.

1244
01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:04.196
Here you go.

1245
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.265
Boom!

1246
01:01:08.402 --> 01:01:09.467
Nice.

1247
01:01:13.173 --> 01:01:14.840
Whoa, did you hear that?

1248
01:01:14.842 --> 01:01:17.075
-Yeah, it was like a...
-Pepper.


1249
01:01:18.478 --> 01:01:19.544
I see.

1250
01:01:19.546 --> 01:01:21.112
Try this guy on for size.

1251
01:01:21.114 --> 01:01:22.981
Oop! Well.

1252
01:01:22.983 --> 01:01:25.517
That was a tricky bounce,
but try to get your glove


1253
01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:27.185
all the way down
on those ground balls, Frank.


1254
01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:28.954
-Okay?
-Got it.


1255
01:01:28.956 --> 01:01:30.488
Throw home!

1256
01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:32.090
Oh!

1257
01:01:32.092 --> 01:01:33.158
Aah!

1258
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.359
Out!

1259
01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:51.443
I'm really sorry, Dad.

1260
01:01:53.547 --> 01:01:54.980
Lookit, uh...

1261
01:01:56.617 --> 01:01:58.149
I'm not gonna put
any pressure on you.


1262
01:01:59.553 --> 01:02:03.221
But before you open that door,
I just want you to think.


1263
01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:05.657
I want you to go ahead
and think about all the things


1264
01:02:05.659 --> 01:02:07.592
that I've told you.

1265
01:02:09.596 --> 01:02:11.997
This is for the rest
of your life.


1266
01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:16.167
Pick me up at 7:30?

1267
01:02:18.906 --> 01:02:19.938
Yeah.

1268
01:02:33.654 --> 01:02:35.186
Nice work, nice work.

1269
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:38.156
Woo!

1270
01:02:38.158 --> 01:02:39.190
Good catch, good catch!

1271
01:02:40.127 --> 01:02:41.159
Woo!

1272
01:02:42.429 --> 01:02:44.396
Well, hello, Coach Don.

1273
01:02:44.398 --> 01:02:45.597
About to give up on you.

1274
01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:47.933
My one rule on tardiness.

1275
01:02:47.935 --> 01:02:49.701
Everyone can be late once.

1276
01:02:59.313 --> 01:03:00.512
All right, fellas, today...

1277
01:03:02.215 --> 01:03:04.549
Today we're gonna give more
of you guys a chance to pitch.


1278
01:03:04.551 --> 01:03:06.117
How does that sound?

1279
01:03:06.119 --> 01:03:07.452
Yeah!

1280
01:03:08.455 --> 01:03:10.422
Where's Jimmy?

1281
01:03:10.424 --> 01:03:12.223
Jimmy won't be with us anymore.

1282
01:03:14.561 --> 01:03:16.594
-Is he okay?
-Some, uh...


1283
01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:21.433
Some of you have heard
the rumors at school. Sadly...


1284
01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:23.668
they're all true.

1285
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:25.270
My Jimmy has...

1286
01:03:25.272 --> 01:03:27.238
gone and gotten himself
a part in Brigadoon.


1287
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.541
Apparently, he feels his skills
are best used in service


1288
01:03:29.543 --> 01:03:31.543
to the American musical theater.

1289
01:03:31.545 --> 01:03:33.562
Now,

1290
01:03:33.563 --> 01:03:35.580
there is a proud tradition
in baseball...


1291
01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:39.050
of rising above tragedy.

1292
01:03:39.052 --> 01:03:41.753
Which is just exactly what
I wanna see you guys do.


1293
01:03:41.755 --> 01:03:43.688
And let's go out
and win another championship.


1294
01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:46.257
- What do you say? Let's go
loosen up those arms! Come on!
- Yeah!


1295
01:03:46.259 --> 01:03:47.993
Lemme see who wants to pitch!

1296
01:04:01.074 --> 01:04:02.574
Great.

1297
01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:07.045
-Got you! Didn't I?
-Oh! Geez Louise!


1298
01:04:07.047 --> 01:04:10.015
Bullshit! I knew it was you,
Tony! Come on.


1299
01:04:10.017 --> 01:04:12.117
Don't arrest me, Officer!
I didn't do anything wrong!


1300
01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:14.652
Yeah, right, I am so sure.

1301
01:04:14.654 --> 01:04:16.287
What's happening?
What, do you have a date?


1302
01:04:16.289 --> 01:04:17.322
No, I...

1303
01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:19.791
I have to go to Parents' Night.

1304
01:04:19.793 --> 01:04:21.226
Pfft! Loser.

1305
01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:24.963
Doesn't Linda do that?

1306
01:04:24.964 --> 01:04:27.765
Well, she has the flu.
Or... she says she has the flu.


1307
01:04:27.768 --> 01:04:29.534
So, she's at home
while you're off to school?


1308
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:31.636
Yes.

1309
01:04:31.638 --> 01:04:33.505
-Just doesn't seem right.
-Tell me about it.


1310
01:04:34.441 --> 01:04:36.341
Hey, uh...

1311
01:04:36.343 --> 01:04:37.642
You wanna grab a beer later?

1312
01:04:37.644 --> 01:04:40.211
- I gotta work, pal.
- Ah...


1313
01:04:41.148 --> 01:04:42.313
-See you around.
-All right.


1314
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.482
Fair enough.

1315
01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:02.434
You okay, Coach?

1316
01:05:04.137 --> 01:05:06.271
Oh. Yeah, I, I just...

1317
01:05:06.273 --> 01:05:08.440
Yeah, you look like you
don't wanna go to school.


1318
01:05:10.644 --> 01:05:13.244
Ten-minute classes
and I still get bored.


1319
01:05:14.614 --> 01:05:17.248
I was just wondering if you
were gonna keep coaching.


1320
01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.350
What do you mean,
because of Jimmy?


1321
01:05:21.822 --> 01:05:22.854
Sure.

1322
01:05:24.224 --> 01:05:25.590
I can't let my guys down, right?

1323
01:05:27.661 --> 01:05:28.760
That's great.

1324
01:05:30.397 --> 01:05:34.399
Because you're doing
a wonderful job with these kids.


1325
01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:37.168
Thank you.

1326
01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:38.703
Now, lemme tell you
something about your Timmy.


1327
01:05:38.705 --> 01:05:40.438
That's a pretty special kid.

1328
01:05:41.541 --> 01:05:42.574
Honest.

1329
01:05:45.378 --> 01:05:46.244
I guarantee you...

1330
01:05:46.245 --> 01:05:47.111
he is gonna get a hit
one of these games.


1331
01:05:47.114 --> 01:05:48.513
I guarantee you.

1332
01:05:49.816 --> 01:05:53.485
Well, maybe we'll
have some classes together.


1333
01:05:53.487 --> 01:05:56.521
¶ ¶

1334
01:06:01.628 --> 01:06:02.694
What?

1335
01:06:05.565 --> 01:06:08.700
Oh my God.

1336
01:06:11.238 --> 01:06:13.638
What was that?

1337
01:06:21.381 --> 01:06:22.881
What do you say, Timmy Tim?

1338
01:06:22.883 --> 01:06:26.684
Tic-tack-toe! Timmy's my guy!
We say Timmy! Here we go, kid!


1339
01:06:28.488 --> 01:06:30.405
-Ball!
-Nothing but strikes, Timmy!


1340
01:06:30.406 --> 01:06:32.323
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy, Timmy,
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy, Timski!


1341
01:06:32.325 --> 01:06:33.358
Here we go!

1342
01:06:34.528 --> 01:06:36.561
You're really on the Timmy
bandwagon today.


1343
01:06:36.563 --> 01:06:38.930
Little thing called
quid pro quo.


1344
01:06:38.932 --> 01:06:40.198
What's that?

1345
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.799
Me and Mrs. Timmy.

1346
01:06:41.801 --> 01:06:43.535
Parents' Night.

1347
01:06:43.537 --> 01:06:44.869
My wife had the flu,

1348
01:06:44.871 --> 01:06:46.721
and Mr. Timmy is...

1349
01:06:46.722 --> 01:06:48.572
Living in the city
with a yoga instructor. Yeah.


1350
01:06:49.809 --> 01:06:51.759
Right.

1351
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.710
So, we went ahead
and hunkered down in her Subaru,


1352
01:06:53.713 --> 01:06:55.813
in the very darkest part
of the parking lot.


1353
01:06:55.815 --> 01:06:57.649
Here we go, Timmy kid!
What do you say?


1354
01:06:58.585 --> 01:06:59.617
Ball two!

1355
01:06:59.619 --> 01:07:00.752
So, what happened?

1356
01:07:00.754 --> 01:07:02.287
What do you think happened?

1357
01:07:03.356 --> 01:07:04.589
Don, you're married.

1358
01:07:04.591 --> 01:07:06.224
Your point is...?

1359
01:07:06.226 --> 01:07:07.458
You shouldn't be
doing that stuff.


1360
01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.626
What, you think
I don't know that?


1361
01:07:08.628 --> 01:07:10.428
I'm only human,
and so is Mrs. Timmy.


1362
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:11.829
You know,
I can't help but think


1363
01:07:11.831 --> 01:07:14.399
that if my wife took
better care of herself,


1364
01:07:14.401 --> 01:07:15.934
she wouldn't have
gotten the flu,


1365
01:07:15.936 --> 01:07:18.536
and she wouldn't have put me in
that position with Mrs. Timmy.


1366
01:07:18.538 --> 01:07:19.571
Ball four!

1367
01:07:19.573 --> 01:07:21.806
Hey, blue, timeout!

1368
01:07:35.488 --> 01:07:36.888
You could totally
take me out, Coach.


1369
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:38.957
I'm not gonna do that,
Timmy, and I'll tell you why.


1370
01:07:38.959 --> 01:07:41.492
'Cause I know for a fact,
if you bear down right now,


1371
01:07:41.494 --> 01:07:43.461
you can get us
out of this inning.


1372
01:07:43.463 --> 01:07:45.396
And I'm never wrong
about that stuff.


1373
01:07:45.398 --> 01:07:47.398
Now, you are a madman.
You are a beast.


1374
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.700
-Who's the beast inside you?
-Lewis.


1375
01:07:48.702 --> 01:07:50.835
Lewis. Hey, Lewis,
tell me you're a beast.


1376
01:07:50.837 --> 01:07:52.770
-I'm a beast. A beast.
-You're a beast. You're a beast.


1377
01:07:52.772 --> 01:07:54.005
-I'm a beast. I'm a beast!
-Beast!


1378
01:07:54.007 --> 01:07:55.506
-You're gonna pitch
like a beast!
-Yeah!


1379
01:07:55.508 --> 01:07:56.941
You're a beast! Go get them!
Come on, Lewis!


1380
01:07:59.512 --> 01:08:00.812
All right, come on, Timbo!

1381
01:08:00.814 --> 01:08:03.381
What do you say, kid?
Just throw to the mitt.


1382
01:08:03.383 --> 01:08:04.649
Let your teammates do the work.

1383
01:08:04.651 --> 01:08:06.517
Here we go, kid, all about you!

1384
01:08:06.519 --> 01:08:08.286
How, uh...

1385
01:08:08.288 --> 01:08:10.622
How'd you know
Mr. Timmy lives in the city?


1386
01:08:11.725 --> 01:08:12.991
She told me.

1387
01:08:12.993 --> 01:08:14.442
She hangs out.

1388
01:08:14.443 --> 01:08:15.892
Helps me put equipment
in the car sometimes.


1389
01:08:15.895 --> 01:08:19.530
Well, you are in sweet shape,
my friend.


1390
01:08:19.532 --> 01:08:20.965
You got a desperate divorcée,

1391
01:08:20.967 --> 01:08:22.700
hanging on by a thread,

1392
01:08:22.702 --> 01:08:24.669
and a dead wife?

1393
01:08:24.671 --> 01:08:26.371
Which is just

1394
01:08:26.373 --> 01:08:27.839
money in the bank.

1395
01:08:27.841 --> 01:08:31.676
You are living my dream.
You are.


1396
01:08:32.812 --> 01:08:34.545
You really are.

1397
01:08:34.547 --> 01:08:37.315
All right, you guys!
Show some character!


1398
01:08:37.317 --> 01:08:39.050
Life's about character!
Here we go!


1399
01:08:46.826 --> 01:08:47.859
Strike!

1400
01:09:00.307 --> 01:09:01.906
Hi, Roger.

1401
01:09:01.908 --> 01:09:03.341
Michael, from now on,

1402
01:09:03.343 --> 01:09:04.776
you need to tell me
if you're leaving early.


1403
01:09:06.746 --> 01:09:09.547
I did. I told you I had
baseball practice


1404
01:09:09.549 --> 01:09:13.384
and that I'd be coming in
early in the morning
to make up the time.


1405
01:09:13.386 --> 01:09:14.752
I got a lot on my plate,
buddy boy.


1406
01:09:14.754 --> 01:09:16.087
You need to make it
crystal clear.


1407
01:09:17.023 --> 01:09:18.556
I understand.

1408
01:09:18.558 --> 01:09:21.726
I'll, uh, I'll send a memo
next time, okay? Bye.


1409
01:09:21.728 --> 01:09:22.827
Asshole!

1410
01:09:23.797 --> 01:09:26.064
Michael?

1411
01:09:26.065 --> 01:09:28.332
Hi, Roger. Sorry, this guy
just cut me off. Asshole!


1412
01:09:28.335 --> 01:09:29.834
Yeah, you!

1413
01:09:29.836 --> 01:09:31.102
Ugh!

1414
01:09:31.104 --> 01:09:33.771
Uh, anything else
I can help you with?


1415
01:09:33.773 --> 01:09:35.973
-We'll talk in the morning.
-Okay!


1416
01:09:35.975 --> 01:09:37.675
Bye!

1417
01:09:40.613 --> 01:09:42.046
No, sorry. I'm... Sorry.

1418
01:09:43.650 --> 01:09:45.917
I am so proud of you guys.

1419
01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:47.552
Granted,

1420
01:09:47.554 --> 01:09:50.888
you're not the most talented
players I've ever seen.


1421
01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:52.090
You drop fly balls.

1422
01:09:52.092 --> 01:09:53.758
You throw wild. 
You strike out.

1423
01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.728
And I don't recall seeing
a team at any level that cries


1424
01:09:56.730 --> 01:09:57.829
as much as you do.

1425
01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:00.698
But... you played
your hearts out,


1426
01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:03.034
and you made the playoffs.

1427
01:10:03.036 --> 01:10:04.936
-Nice going.
-Yeah.


1428
01:10:04.938 --> 01:10:06.637
Every team makes
the playoffs though, right?


1429
01:10:06.639 --> 01:10:08.940
Technically, that's true,
Michael,


1430
01:10:08.942 --> 01:10:11.943
but let's not detract
from what these young men
have accomplished.


1431
01:10:11.945 --> 01:10:13.878
Incidentally,
you're in violation of our


1432
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.414
first rule about
getting here on time.


1433
01:10:16.416 --> 01:10:18.483
-I let you know

1434
01:10:18.485 --> 01:10:21.419
but we'll take that up at our
coaches' meeting after practice.


1435
01:10:21.421 --> 01:10:24.055
Now, how do we succeed

1436
01:10:24.057 --> 01:10:25.790
in the playoffs? Answer.

1437
01:10:26.993 --> 01:10:29.060
By winning games.
And how do we win games?


1438
01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:33.097
Answer. By scoring more runs
than the other team.


1439
01:10:33.099 --> 01:10:35.400
Which is why we are instituting

1440
01:10:35.402 --> 01:10:38.002
a new and exciting strategy,

1441
01:10:38.004 --> 01:10:40.405
for the playoffs.

1442
01:10:40.407 --> 01:10:41.639
Pirates, bring it in.

1443
01:10:43.943 --> 01:10:45.710
This strategy is so secret,

1444
01:10:45.712 --> 01:10:47.812
I don't even want you to
tell your parents about it.


1445
01:10:47.814 --> 01:10:49.080
Can you be trusted?

1446
01:10:49.082 --> 01:10:51.082
Yes, sir.

1447
01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:52.417
As you were.

1448
01:10:52.419 --> 01:10:53.851
¶ ¶

1449
01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:00.124
This...

1450
01:11:00.126 --> 01:11:02.593
is our new signal.

1451
01:11:02.595 --> 01:11:05.863
As soon as you get on base,
you look at me.


1452
01:11:05.865 --> 01:11:08.599
If you see that my hat
is turned around like this,


1453
01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:10.435
when you get to the next base,

1454
01:11:10.437 --> 01:11:15.440
you slide and pretend
that you injured your leg.


1455
01:11:15.442 --> 01:11:18.042
Hold onto it. Yell.

1456
01:11:18.044 --> 01:11:20.778
Squirt a few tears.
That shouldn't be a stretch
for most of you.


1457
01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.614
And why do I want you
to do this?


1458
01:11:24.551 --> 01:11:26.184
So that I can take you out,

1459
01:11:26.186 --> 01:11:27.819
and put a faster runner in,

1460
01:11:27.821 --> 01:11:29.654
and maybe score a run

1461
01:11:29.656 --> 01:11:32.190
that we wouldn't
have gotten otherwise.


1462
01:11:32.192 --> 01:11:36.961
This is a very special strategy,

1463
01:11:36.963 --> 01:11:38.863
for our slower runners.

1464
01:11:38.865 --> 01:11:41.532
Rusty, you would be
a top candidate.


1465
01:11:41.534 --> 01:11:43.534
And if lightning should strike,

1466
01:11:43.536 --> 01:11:45.803
and Frankie, you happen
to find yourself on base,


1467
01:11:45.805 --> 01:11:47.705
I want you to go ahead
and clean your glasses off


1468
01:11:47.707 --> 01:11:49.106
and take a look at my hat.

1469
01:11:49.108 --> 01:11:51.609
This isn't a strategy.
This is cheating.


1470
01:11:51.611 --> 01:11:54.245
I have no problem if you stopped
talking right now, Michael.


1471
01:11:54.247 --> 01:11:57.181
If we can't find
a way to win fair and square,
I, for one, would rather lose.


1472
01:11:57.183 --> 01:12:00.718
You cannot stand in front of
people in their formative years,


1473
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.987
and say that you would,
"rather lose."


1474
01:12:02.989 --> 01:12:04.822
-I would rather lose than cheat.
-Oh, please don't,


1475
01:12:04.824 --> 01:12:07.558
please don't waste our time
quoting from the handbook
of curling.


1476
01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.527
This is baseball.

1477
01:12:09.529 --> 01:12:10.661
This is wrong.

1478
01:12:11.631 --> 01:12:12.730
One, two, three, look at me.

1479
01:12:14.501 --> 01:12:16.801
All right, Pirates.
We're gonna start the practice


1480
01:12:16.803 --> 01:12:20.505
by taking a nice long lap
around the field.


1481
01:12:20.507 --> 01:12:21.873
I have decided to move up

1482
01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.941
our coaches' meeting
to a little earlier.


1483
01:12:23.943 --> 01:12:25.009
Here we go. Let's go.

1484
01:12:26.279 --> 01:12:27.812
Hustle!

1485
01:12:31.518 --> 01:12:33.784
We lost our best player.

1486
01:12:33.786 --> 01:12:36.854
I feel responsible
that it's my kid,


1487
01:12:36.856 --> 01:12:39.924
who's putting on makeup
and prancing around in tights,


1488
01:12:39.926 --> 01:12:43.194
instead of whiffing guys
with his fastball.


1489
01:12:43.196 --> 01:12:44.929
I'm trying to make up
for that loss.


1490
01:12:44.931 --> 01:12:46.881
Just let 'em play.

1491
01:12:46.882 --> 01:12:48.832
-You ever read
the rulebook, Michael?
-No.


1492
01:12:48.835 --> 01:12:51.753
Well, let me tell you something.

1493
01:12:51.754 --> 01:12:54.672
My strategy is fully sanctioned
by the Ripken rulebook.


1494
01:12:54.674 --> 01:12:57.942
An injured baserunner
may be replaced...


1495
01:12:57.944 --> 01:12:59.844
But they're not
actually injured!


1496
01:12:59.846 --> 01:13:01.746
-They're acting injured!
-Acting?


1497
01:13:01.748 --> 01:13:02.813
¶ ¶

1498
01:13:02.815 --> 01:13:04.081
Is that a shot at my Jimmy?

1499
01:13:04.083 --> 01:13:06.584
What? No! No,
it's a shot at you!


1500
01:13:06.586 --> 01:13:07.818
For being so obsessed
with winning


1501
01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:09.253
that you're gonna teach
these kids to cheat.


1502
01:13:09.255 --> 01:13:10.688
I'm warning you.

1503
01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:12.690
You have been no help all year.

1504
01:13:12.692 --> 01:13:15.293
I have done everything.

1505
01:13:15.295 --> 01:13:17.228
Snacks, schedules, fungoes.

1506
01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:19.263
Oh! You're still mad
about the headlight!


1507
01:13:19.265 --> 01:13:22.199
The only reason you offered
to pay for my headlight


1508
01:13:22.201 --> 01:13:25.102
was to show that
you were the guy with
the high dollar value


1509
01:13:25.104 --> 01:13:28.005
-and I was the jerk with a van!
-That is so wrong.


1510
01:13:28.007 --> 01:13:30.541
Always on the phone,

1511
01:13:30.542 --> 01:13:33.076
making calls that are so much
more important than the kids.


1512
01:13:33.079 --> 01:13:35.146
I, I talk on the phone to Roger,

1513
01:13:35.148 --> 01:13:38.316
my boss, who's 24,
loves to boss me around.


1514
01:13:38.318 --> 01:13:39.884
I used to have an okay job,

1515
01:13:39.886 --> 01:13:42.186
before they busted me down
for missing too much work.


1516
01:13:42.188 --> 01:13:45.089
Tardy? Stuck in that
unbelievable traffic?


1517
01:13:45.091 --> 01:13:47.224
I missed a lot of days
when my wife was sick.


1518
01:13:47.226 --> 01:13:50.962
Oh, you just cannot wait to play
that trump card, can you?


1519
01:13:50.964 --> 01:13:53.064
The reason why I was late today
was 'cause I had to make sure


1520
01:13:53.066 --> 01:13:55.066
Roger's desk got here on time.

1521
01:13:55.068 --> 01:13:56.968
Does that sound like
a big shot job to you?


1522
01:13:59.038 --> 01:14:00.588
All you had to do was call.

1523
01:14:00.589 --> 01:14:02.139
I did call! I called Linda!
Your wife.


1524
01:14:02.141 --> 01:14:05.743
Nice try, but she was
at book club last night,
and it ran late.


1525
01:14:05.745 --> 01:14:07.678
They got in an argument
about The Da Vinci Code.


1526
01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.147
She was not even home
until 11:30.


1527
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:12.016
I called at 7:30.

1528
01:14:12.018 --> 01:14:14.402
You tell her
you were gonna be late?


1529
01:14:14.403 --> 01:14:16.787
Well, I tried, but she said
she was on the other line
and would get back to me.


1530
01:14:16.789 --> 01:14:19.357
-Did she?
-Well, what happened was,
she got back on my line,


1531
01:14:19.359 --> 01:14:22.994
-obviously thinking she'd
switched over to the other line.
-Why do you think that?


1532
01:14:22.996 --> 01:14:25.663
Because she said, "I'll meet you
at the usual place!"


1533
01:14:28.034 --> 01:14:29.634
Who was she talking to?

1534
01:14:29.636 --> 01:14:30.819
I don't know!

1535
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.003
She was on her line,
I was on my line.


1536
01:14:32.005 --> 01:14:33.204
-It was all rolled up.
-Oh no, no...


1537
01:14:33.206 --> 01:14:34.939
What name did she use?

1538
01:14:34.941 --> 01:14:37.008
-She didn't use a name.
-Yes, she did!


1539
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:39.343
Don... Eh... The kids!

1540
01:14:39.345 --> 01:14:42.246
Run. Go ahead, all the way
to field D. Let's go!


1541
01:14:42.248 --> 01:14:43.748
¶ ¶

1542
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.384
Now you!

1543
01:14:46.386 --> 01:14:48.819
Hey, I don't wanna fight.
Are we gonna fight?


1544
01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:50.388
Of course not, pal.

1545
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:51.989
-Hey!
-Take off the mask.


1546
01:14:51.991 --> 01:14:54.692
-No. No!
-Tell me what Linda said.


1547
01:14:54.694 --> 01:14:56.193
What if...
What if I don't?


1548
01:14:56.195 --> 01:14:58.162
-Then I'll kill you.
But we are not gonna fight.
-Don, no!


1549
01:14:59.432 --> 01:15:01.399
Jesus! Ah!

1550
01:15:04.037 --> 01:15:05.703
Don!

1551
01:15:05.705 --> 01:15:07.371
I thought you said
we weren't gonna fight.


1552
01:15:07.373 --> 01:15:09.273
Well, don't fight back
and we won't be fighting.


1553
01:15:09.275 --> 01:15:11.075
-What did she say?
-Help...


1554
01:15:11.077 --> 01:15:12.376
-Come on!
-...me.


1555
01:15:12.378 --> 01:15:15.012
What did she say?

1556
01:15:15.014 --> 01:15:17.682
She said I'll meet you
at the usual place,


1557
01:15:17.684 --> 01:15:19.116
TB.

1558
01:15:19.118 --> 01:15:20.451
-TB?
-I think so...


1559
01:15:20.453 --> 01:15:21.952
Huh?

1560
01:15:25.858 --> 01:15:26.924
Tony Barone?

1561
01:15:28.728 --> 01:15:31.462
Huh? Oh, come on.

1562
01:15:31.464 --> 01:15:32.730
Tony Barone?

1563
01:15:56.989 --> 01:15:59.123
Hey, Don.

1564
01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:00.424
Maybe there's some kind
of explanation.


1565
01:16:00.426 --> 01:16:03.227
-Of course there is.
-Well, there you go!


1566
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:04.729
What do you think it is?

1567
01:16:04.731 --> 01:16:06.363
Either they're planning
a surprise party for me


1568
01:16:06.365 --> 01:16:08.132
or my best friend
is banging my wife.


1569
01:16:09.469 --> 01:16:12.403
Boy, wouldn't it be great
if it's a surprise party.


1570
01:16:18.244 --> 01:16:19.276
Hey, everybody.

1571
01:16:19.278 --> 01:16:21.378
So, Coach Don had
to leave early.


1572
01:16:22.415 --> 01:16:24.882
So, I guess that
makes me the coach.


1573
01:16:24.884 --> 01:16:27.151
I know that was a long run.
It's pretty hot out here.


1574
01:16:27.153 --> 01:16:29.520
So, if any of you
are feeling faint,
feel free to sit down.


1575
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:33.124
All right.
Every single one of you.


1576
01:16:34.193 --> 01:16:35.860
Well, when you're
feeling better,


1577
01:16:35.862 --> 01:16:38.095
we're gonna have
batting practice.


1578
01:16:38.097 --> 01:16:40.931
Uh, first one to touch
home plate bats first.


1579
01:16:43.402 --> 01:16:45.870
¶ ¶

1580
01:16:52.378 --> 01:16:56.347
¶ It's too far gone to say ¶

1581
01:16:58.518 --> 01:17:03.454
¶ We tried to put the pieces ¶

1582
01:17:03.456 --> 01:17:04.989
¶ Back together ¶

1583
01:17:07.093 --> 01:17:09.994
¶ For the first time
I discovered ¶


1584
01:17:09.996 --> 01:17:13.531
¶ Someone I was meant to be ¶

1585
01:17:13.533 --> 01:17:18.536
¶ And the world looks so much
brighter when I'm following ¶


1586
01:17:18.538 --> 01:17:20.471
¶ My dream ¶

1587
01:17:24.076 --> 01:17:25.843
¶ ¶

1588
01:17:26.579 --> 01:17:28.012
All right, everybody.

1589
01:17:28.014 --> 01:17:29.213
Everybody look alive!

1590
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:31.882
Nice. Get in front of it!

1591
01:17:34.987 --> 01:17:36.220
Way to knock it down.

1592
01:17:36.222 --> 01:17:38.455
Oh, Eric! You're a stud.

1593
01:17:39.892 --> 01:17:42.092
Oh! Is he gonna make it?

1594
01:17:42.094 --> 01:17:43.494
Yes, he is!

1595
01:17:43.496 --> 01:17:45.229
Look at my Pirates!

1596
01:17:46.933 --> 01:17:47.998
What an arm.

1597
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.300
Second base!

1598
01:17:52.972 --> 01:17:54.004
There it is!

1599
01:17:56.142 --> 01:17:57.208
Woo, out!

1600
01:17:58.144 --> 01:17:59.176
One more.

1601
01:18:02.181 --> 01:18:04.348
Oh!

1602
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:07.284
Oh! Everybody, give him a hand.
You see how fast he was?


1603
01:18:07.286 --> 01:18:09.253
Pirates! Give yourselves a hand!

1604
01:18:11.324 --> 01:18:12.389
¶ ¶

1605
01:18:35.214 --> 01:18:36.280
Hey, Don.

1606
01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:40.217
Is it okay I just
dropped by like this?


1607
01:18:40.219 --> 01:18:42.019
I guess it'll have to be.

1608
01:18:42.021 --> 01:18:43.621
I heard you were
living out here,


1609
01:18:43.623 --> 01:18:45.389
and I didn't know any other way
to get in touch...


1610
01:18:45.391 --> 01:18:47.324
Oh, don't get any ideas,
Michael. This...


1611
01:18:51.564 --> 01:18:53.297
This is all just temporary.

1612
01:18:56.335 --> 01:18:58.168
I just thought
you might like to know


1613
01:18:58.170 --> 01:19:00.537
how we did on
our first playoff game.


1614
01:19:00.539 --> 01:19:03.540
Score's tied. Last inning.

1615
01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:05.910
Rusty's on first.

1616
01:19:11.284 --> 01:19:12.583
Hoo!

1617
01:19:12.585 --> 01:19:15.319
I'm so nervous,
I turn my hat around backwards,


1618
01:19:15.321 --> 01:19:17.021
without even thinking about it.

1619
01:19:19.392 --> 01:19:20.457
Eh!

1620
01:19:22.495 --> 01:19:24.094
Oh, my leg!

1621
01:19:24.096 --> 01:19:25.429
Wha...

1622
01:19:25.431 --> 01:19:27.631
Oh, my leg!
I think I broke my leg!


1623
01:19:27.633 --> 01:19:28.699
Oh!

1624
01:19:28.701 --> 01:19:30.534
Oh, my leg!

1625
01:19:33.039 --> 01:19:34.638
Uh... You okay?

1626
01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.243
-Think I broke my leg!
Ah! Oh my gosh!
-You okay? You okay?


1627
01:19:39.245 --> 01:19:41.946
Ah! Ah! I can see the light!

1628
01:19:41.948 --> 01:19:43.414
Oh.

1629
01:19:43.416 --> 01:19:45.215
Here, let me get you.
Can you walk on it?


1630
01:19:45.217 --> 01:19:46.550
-I don't think...
-Here. Put your hand...


1631
01:19:46.552 --> 01:19:48.319
Ready? Okay.

1632
01:19:48.321 --> 01:19:50.220
Hey, Coach!
Let's get a runner in there.


1633
01:19:50.222 --> 01:19:53.324
-Uh... Timor! Take second!
-Oh! My leg...


1634
01:19:53.326 --> 01:19:55.526
Yeah! Run, run, run, run, run.

1635
01:19:55.528 --> 01:19:56.961
I put Timor in.

1636
01:19:56.963 --> 01:19:58.729
He steals third,

1637
01:19:58.731 --> 01:20:00.431
steals home,

1638
01:20:00.433 --> 01:20:02.099
and we win.

1639
01:20:06.238 --> 01:20:09.606
So, in other words,
my substitute runner strategy


1640
01:20:10.543 --> 01:20:12.009
worked, huh?

1641
01:20:13.546 --> 01:20:15.479
By accident. Yeah.

1642
01:20:20.987 --> 01:20:22.419
That's not totally bad, Michael.

1643
01:20:24.457 --> 01:20:26.090
That's not totally bad.

1644
01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.593
Listen, Don, if there's
anything I can do...


1645
01:20:30.529 --> 01:20:32.329
If you wanna take a shower.

1646
01:20:32.331 --> 01:20:34.098
Spend the night in a house.

1647
01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:36.367
Thanks. But...

1648
01:20:39.238 --> 01:20:41.038
Me and Linda,
we're gonna work it out.


1649
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.406
Really?

1650
01:20:42.408 --> 01:20:44.341
Wow, okay!

1651
01:20:44.343 --> 01:20:45.409
Yeah.

1652
01:20:46.345 --> 01:20:47.411
Yeah.

1653
01:20:48.347 --> 01:20:49.446
We all screw up, right?

1654
01:20:50.483 --> 01:20:52.216
And there have been times,

1655
01:20:52.218 --> 01:20:54.518
when I've done things
with people, women people,


1656
01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.054
that, technically,
I should not have.


1657
01:20:57.056 --> 01:20:59.273
The point is,

1658
01:20:59.274 --> 01:21:01.491
we have to learn to forgive
each other and ourselves.


1659
01:21:01.494 --> 01:21:05.429
So, that we don't let a few
mistakes ruin our lives.


1660
01:21:05.431 --> 01:21:06.530
So...

1661
01:21:08.167 --> 01:21:09.366
We're gonna give it
another shot.


1662
01:21:09.368 --> 01:21:12.269
Oh boy, am I glad to hear that.

1663
01:21:13.406 --> 01:21:15.272
Listen, I haven't
run it by her yet.


1664
01:21:17.309 --> 01:21:18.575
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

1665
01:21:20.112 --> 01:21:21.578
Absolutely.

1666
01:21:22.748 --> 01:21:23.814
Very good.

1667
01:21:25.684 --> 01:21:27.351
Good luck.

1668
01:21:27.353 --> 01:21:28.719
Thanks. You too.

1669
01:21:30.122 --> 01:21:31.789
I hope you win
that championship.


1670
01:21:33.426 --> 01:21:35.059
Well, win or lose,

1671
01:21:35.061 --> 01:21:37.161
it's been a great season.

1672
01:21:37.163 --> 01:21:38.462
That's the key.

1673
01:21:39.698 --> 01:21:41.331
That's the key.

1674
01:21:41.333 --> 01:21:42.800
No pressure.

1675
01:21:44.203 --> 01:21:46.570
Play it like it's
just another game.


1676
01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:17.501

1696
01:23:38.384 --> 01:23:40.317
Well, what do you think?

1697
01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:41.785
Would you talk to me
on the street?


1698
01:23:41.787 --> 01:23:44.321
-Mm?
-Mm?


1699
01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:46.256
I think I look pretty good.

1700
01:23:47.593 --> 01:23:49.326
If you marry Timmy's mom,

1701
01:23:49.328 --> 01:23:50.894
will I have to share my room
with Timmy?


1702
01:23:51.897 --> 01:23:53.497
Oh, buddy.

1703
01:23:53.499 --> 01:23:55.332
We're... we're just
going on a date.


1704
01:23:55.334 --> 01:23:57.267
So, you're not getting married?

1705
01:23:57.269 --> 01:23:58.669
No! No.

1706
01:23:58.671 --> 01:23:59.870
I mean, I don't know.

1707
01:24:00.806 --> 01:24:01.939
So, you might get married?

1708
01:24:04.443 --> 01:24:06.843
I, I, I'm just hoping
to make it through dinner.


1709
01:24:06.845 --> 01:24:09.446
Because I'm okay with
sharing my room with Timmy.


1710
01:24:11.917 --> 01:24:13.383
Uh-huh.

1711
01:24:13.385 --> 01:24:14.451
Okay.

Love you.

1720

-Go get some ice cream.
-Okay.


1721
01:25:28.727 --> 01:25:31.395
God Almighty!

1722
01:25:32.631 --> 01:25:35.065
That was so great!

1723
01:25:35.067 --> 01:25:37.534
You were so great! Oh!

1724

¶ ¶

1725
01:25:50.849 --> 01:25:52.716
You kicked ass in there, Jimmy.

1726
01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:56.787
I've never been
more proud of you.


1727
01:25:59.358 --> 01:26:01.792
Was this better than when
I beat the Cubs last year?


1728
01:26:06.732 --> 01:26:07.898
Not better, son.

1729
01:26:10.102 --> 01:26:11.835
It was different.

1730
01:26:14.506 --> 01:26:16.873
Mom said it was okay
if we went for ice cream.


1731
01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:18.742
Yeah.

1732
01:26:21.046 --> 01:26:22.579
We could...

1733
01:26:22.581 --> 01:26:24.047
We could do spoons.

1734
01:26:25.551 --> 01:26:26.850
We could do that.

1735
01:26:30.889 --> 01:26:31.955
¶ ¶

1736
01:26:57.516 --> 01:26:59.416
Oh, this was really fun,
Michael.


1737
01:26:59.418 --> 01:27:00.984
Yeah, me, too.

1738
01:27:00.986 --> 01:27:02.786
- I mean, it... I had,
I had fun, too.


1739
01:27:02.788 --> 01:27:03.954
This was fun.

1740
01:27:07.393 --> 01:27:09.092
Well...

1741
01:27:09.094 --> 01:27:10.727
-Good night.
-Okay.


1742
01:27:10.729 --> 01:27:12.462
Yeah. Good night.

1743
01:27:12.464 --> 01:27:13.530
See you.

1744
01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:15.866
Uh, Carolyn.

1745
01:27:26.111 --> 01:27:27.778
-See you again.
-Yeah.


1746
01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:29.780
-Okay.
-Love it.


1747
01:27:29.782 --> 01:27:32.482
-Bye.
-You look beautiful.


1748
01:27:32.484 --> 01:27:33.917
I mean, you do look beautiful.

1749
01:27:33.919 --> 01:27:35.419
-Thank you.
-I'm gonna go now.


1750
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:53.036
You coming in?

1751
01:28:00.813 --> 01:28:02.612
No, that's... That's okay.

1752
01:28:02.614 --> 01:28:04.080
I'll see you tomorrow.

1753
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:07.017
Bye, Dad.

1754
01:28:07.019 --> 01:28:08.051
I love you, pal.

1755
01:28:08.053 --> 01:28:09.085
Love you, too.

1756
01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:13.790
I'm really glad you came today.

1757
01:28:15.461 --> 01:28:16.560
Me too.

1758

1763

Play ball!

1764
01:28:57.101 --> 01:28:58.934
Here we go, folks.
The championship game.


1765
01:28:58.937 --> 01:29:01.171
Featuring last year's
pennant-winning Pirates,


1766
01:29:01.173 --> 01:29:02.772
facing the streaking Cardinals.

1767
01:29:02.774 --> 01:29:04.641
All right, guys. No pressure.

1768
01:29:04.643 --> 01:29:06.576
We're just gonna play this
like it's any other game.


1769
01:29:06.578 --> 01:29:08.078
Really, Rusty?

1770
01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.279
Most important game
of the season,


1771
01:29:09.281 --> 01:29:10.514
you can't get here on time?

1772
01:29:10.516 --> 01:29:12.215
There's a long line at the IHOP!

1773
01:29:12.217 --> 01:29:13.250
Uh-huh.

1774
01:29:14.286 --> 01:29:16.152
All right,
so we're the home team,


1775
01:29:16.154 --> 01:29:17.721
that means we bat first.

1776
01:29:17.723 --> 01:29:18.755
- And that...
- No.


1777
01:29:18.757 --> 01:29:20.123
That we means we bat second.

1778
01:29:20.125 --> 01:29:21.525
And we're gonna
give it our all.


1779
01:29:21.527 --> 01:29:24.027
We win, you guys get
a really big trophy.


1780
01:29:24.029 --> 01:29:26.263
If we lose, we get

1781
01:29:26.265 --> 01:29:27.964
slightly smaller trophy.

1782
01:29:27.966 --> 01:29:30.066
So, let's get out there.

1783
01:29:31.103 --> 01:29:32.135
All right.

1784
01:29:44.816 --> 01:29:45.916
Strike!

1785
01:29:50.822 --> 01:29:52.289
All strikes, Kahil! Let's go!

1786
01:29:52.291 --> 01:29:54.057
I got your back, man! Come on!

1787
01:29:54.059 --> 01:29:55.125
Throw some strikes! I'm ready!

1788
01:29:55.127 --> 01:29:56.192
Come on!

1789
01:29:58.096 --> 01:29:59.329
All right, let's go!

1790
01:29:59.331 --> 01:30:01.765
-Hey, Mike.
-Hey.


1791
01:30:01.767 --> 01:30:05.235
-Brought some, uh,
some snacks for the guys.
-Why thanks, Don.


1792
01:30:05.237 --> 01:30:08.672
Coming to the plate
is Ralph "Boom Boom" Johnson.


1793
01:30:08.674 --> 01:30:10.040
So, uh, you sticking around?

1794
01:30:10.042 --> 01:30:12.075
No! No, no, no, I got...

1795
01:30:12.077 --> 01:30:13.310
I got stuff I gotta do.

1796
01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:22.786
Let's go!

1797
01:30:27.025 --> 01:30:28.091
Strike!

1798
01:30:28.093 --> 01:30:30.694
Yeah, so I...

1799
01:30:31.863 --> 01:30:33.997
went to that Brigadoon thing
last night, or,


1800
01:30:33.999 --> 01:30:36.199
or whatever you call it.
And I tell you what, it...


1801
01:30:37.919 --> 01:30:39.636
Jimmy would have won easy
if they were keeping score.


1802
01:30:39.638 --> 01:30:41.905
Well, boy,
we sure could use him.


1803
01:30:41.907 --> 01:30:42.973
Yeah.

1804
01:30:45.177 --> 01:30:48.011
-Hey, you wanna
coach first base?
-What?


1805
01:30:48.013 --> 01:30:49.245
Yeah.

1806
01:30:50.716 --> 01:30:51.915
If you need me. Y...

1807
01:30:51.917 --> 01:30:53.149
Yeah, sure thing.

1808
01:30:53.151 --> 01:30:54.884
Ball!

1809
01:30:54.886 --> 01:30:56.853
Eh... All right!
Look alive out there, boys.


1810
01:30:56.855 --> 01:30:58.121
Look alive!

1811
01:30:58.123 --> 01:30:59.356
Little heat on the hill, Kahil.

1812
01:31:00.325 --> 01:31:02.092
I got a confession to make, Don.

1813
01:31:02.094 --> 01:31:03.393
I really wanna win.

1814
01:31:03.395 --> 01:31:05.095
Come on, now,
you're in the championship.


1815
01:31:05.097 --> 01:31:06.196
You're a winner already.

1816
01:31:06.198 --> 01:31:09.699
No, no. I mean,
I really wanna win.


1817
01:31:09.701 --> 01:31:12.369
I haven't changed my underwear
since class started.


1818
01:31:12.371 --> 01:31:14.638
Look at that.

1819
01:31:15.874 --> 01:31:18.308
You are turning into a real
baseball man there, Mike.


1820
01:31:29.755 --> 01:31:30.854
That's in, that's in!

1821
01:31:30.856 --> 01:31:32.956
Hit the cutoff man! Yeah!

1822
01:31:32.958 --> 01:31:34.691
Back, back, back!

1823
01:31:34.693 --> 01:31:35.725
Thataway!

1824
01:31:36.795 --> 01:31:39.929
Let's go! Let's go!

1825
01:31:39.931 --> 01:31:41.164
You go, Pirates!

1826
01:31:41.166 --> 01:31:42.999
Way to hold him,
way to hold him!


1827
01:31:44.069 --> 01:31:45.368
Boy, I'd like to adopt that kid.

1828
01:31:45.370 --> 01:31:47.103
Nobody'd ever beat us.

1829
01:31:49.007 --> 01:31:50.674
You, uh...

1830
01:31:50.676 --> 01:31:53.043
You go out and talk to Kahil
for just a, a second or two?


1831
01:31:53.045 --> 01:31:55.812
Oh, yeah! Right, thanks.
Uh, blue? Timeout!


1832
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:58.248
¶ ¶

1833
01:32:00.118 --> 01:32:02.218
Uh... Uh...

1834
01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:03.253
Uh...

1835
01:32:04.823 --> 01:32:06.723
I, I, I'd be more than glad
to hold onto that for you.


1836
01:32:06.725 --> 01:32:08.958
-Yeah!
-Yeah. Great. Go talk to Kahil.


1837
01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.461
Get him straightened out.
Here we go, Pirates!


1838
01:32:11.463 --> 01:32:13.897
-Hey, Coach.
-You okay?


1839
01:32:13.899 --> 01:32:15.331
My nose hurts.

1840
01:32:15.333 --> 01:32:17.734
-Your nose?
-My brother kicked me
last night.


1841
01:32:17.736 --> 01:32:20.236
It wasn't a accident,
but I get yelled at.


1842
01:32:20.238 --> 01:32:21.738
You wanna stay in?

1843
01:32:22.908 --> 01:32:24.374
If I'd a kicked him,
it would have been like,


1844
01:32:24.376 --> 01:32:26.910
"no Xbox for a week." It sucks.

1845
01:32:26.912 --> 01:32:30.213
Yeah. Try to focus on the game.
Okay, Kahil?


1846
01:32:30.215 --> 01:32:32.415
- All right.
- All right!


1847
01:32:32.417 --> 01:32:34.484
Let's see some heat!

1848
01:32:35.854 --> 01:32:37.087
Oh, oh, oh! Don, no, no!

1849
01:32:37.089 --> 01:32:39.289
-What are you doing?
-You're a winner, Mike.


1850
01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:40.423
-You're a winner.
-Wait, wait.


1851
01:32:40.425 --> 01:32:42.892
No, no, no, no! Thi...
This is my job.


1852
01:32:42.894 --> 01:32:45.829
Hey, your boss is not your boss.

1853
01:32:45.831 --> 01:32:47.497
-Who's your boss?
-Oh...


1854
01:32:47.499 --> 01:32:49.132
I know I'm supposed to say me,

1855
01:32:49.134 --> 01:32:50.967
but I don't think that's
actually true in this case.


1856
01:32:50.969 --> 01:32:52.335
Are you the boss?

1857
01:32:52.337 --> 01:32:54.504
-Are you the boss?
-Okay.


1858
01:32:54.506 --> 01:32:56.172
I do this,

1859
01:32:56.174 --> 01:32:58.441
for you, Mike.

1860
01:32:58.443 --> 01:32:59.809
Oh!

1861
01:32:59.811 --> 01:33:01.661
Oh!

1862
01:33:01.662 --> 01:33:03.512
- Now, we can concentrate
on baseball!


1863
01:33:03.515 --> 01:33:05.281
- All right.
- Woo!


1864
01:33:05.283 --> 01:33:06.983
Take that Roger, you jerk!

1865
01:33:06.985 --> 01:33:08.251
-Attaboy!
-Who's the boss, now?


1866
01:33:08.253 --> 01:33:09.886
That feels good, doesn't it?

1867
01:33:09.888 --> 01:33:11.338
That feels good.

1868
01:33:11.339 --> 01:33:12.789
-Hey, talk it up out there!
-Yes, indeed.


1869
01:33:12.791 --> 01:33:13.890
-I can't hear you!
-Yes, indeed!


1870
01:33:13.892 --> 01:33:15.391
You got this Kahil.

1871
01:33:15.393 --> 01:33:17.210
C'mon, we're gonna win this one!

1872
01:33:17.211 --> 01:33:19.028
-Strike him out!
-Come on, Kahil! You can do it!


1873
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:21.164
Let's go, Kahil! Throw some
strikes! Let's go!


1874
01:33:21.166 --> 01:33:23.066
Now, we got a little
round ball going.


1875
01:33:28.173 --> 01:33:29.906
Oh, pop up! Pop up!

1876
01:33:29.908 --> 01:33:33.276
No, no, no! No play, Eric!
No play!


1877
01:33:33.278 --> 01:33:34.344
Out!

1878
01:33:38.150 --> 01:33:39.816
Atta kid, atta kid!

1879
01:33:47.793 --> 01:33:51.361
-You see that!?
-Why don't you tell your son
he made a great play?


1880
01:33:54.299 --> 01:33:56.065
Hey, Ed! I'm talking to you!

1881
01:33:56.067 --> 01:33:58.067
Yeah, it was a good play.

1882
01:33:58.069 --> 01:34:00.470
No, you're louder than that
when he screws up.
I don't think he heard you.


1883
01:34:00.472 --> 01:34:02.138
Why don't you go sit down, Don?

1884
01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:04.474
I just wanna hear you say,
"Eric, you made a great play."


1885
01:34:04.476 --> 01:34:07.377
-Why don't you mind
your own business? Yeah?
-This is my business!


1886
01:34:07.379 --> 01:34:09.512
-We need you, Don.
-I am not done
with you yet, pal.


1887
01:34:09.514 --> 01:34:11.815
-That's terrific. All right.
-I am not done with you.


1888
01:34:11.817 --> 01:34:13.516
¶ I got the
gold in my hands ¶

Strike!

1891
01:34:18.223 --> 01:34:19.322
Strike two!

1892
01:34:19.324 --> 01:34:20.356
And three!

1893
01:34:20.358 --> 01:34:23.126
¶ It's good enough for you ¶

1894
01:34:25.096 --> 01:34:26.830
¶ Worked too hard too long ¶

1895
01:34:26.832 --> 01:34:29.365
¶ Came too far just
to turn back now ¶


1896
01:34:32.604 --> 01:34:34.904
Take two! Take two! Take two!

1897
01:34:34.906 --> 01:34:36.506
¶ I'm a new sensation ¶

1898
01:34:36.508 --> 01:34:39.209
¶ Came to win, win,
win, win, win ¶


1899
01:34:44.850 --> 01:34:47.383
Here we go, Tito!
Hustle, hustle, hustle!


1900
01:34:47.385 --> 01:34:49.552
Feet, feet, feet, that a boy!

1901
01:34:51.389 --> 01:34:53.623
¶ Keep your eyes
on the juice, honey ¶


1902
01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:56.459
¶ 'Cause I will be okay ¶

1903
01:34:57.395 --> 01:34:58.895
Nice! Come on, Tito!

1904
01:34:59.631 --> 01:35:01.130
Oh!

1905
01:35:04.269 --> 01:35:06.269
¶ You want the power
and the glory ¶


1906
01:35:06.271 --> 01:35:07.904
¶ And it ain't no sin ¶

1907
01:35:07.906 --> 01:35:09.372
¶ Till the new sensation ¶

1908
01:35:09.374 --> 01:35:12.208
¶ Came to win, win,
win, win, win ¶


1909
01:35:12.210 --> 01:35:13.610
Throw it to home!

1910
01:35:13.612 --> 01:35:15.912
- Safe!
- Oh!


1911
01:35:15.914 --> 01:35:17.914
Good throw! Good throw!

1912
01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.353
¶ Yeah ¶

1913
01:35:24.522 --> 01:35:27.156
Woo! Woo!

1914
01:35:29.294 --> 01:35:30.326
Get him, get him, get him!

1915
01:35:30.328 --> 01:35:32.428
¶ Put your heart to the line ¶

1916
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:35.031
¶ Came to far
just to turn away ¶


1917
01:35:36.167 --> 01:35:38.601
¶ Uh, uh, uh ¶

1918
01:35:38.603 --> 01:35:42.372
¶ Yeah ¶

1919
01:35:43.308 --> 01:35:44.474
You know who's looking good?

1920
01:35:44.476 --> 01:35:47.043
Yeah. Eric.
Having the game of his life.


1921
01:35:47.045 --> 01:35:48.444
Mrs. Timmy.

1922
01:35:48.446 --> 01:35:51.080
Well, same outfit she had on
at Parents' Night.


1923
01:35:51.082 --> 01:35:53.049
Plus she just smiled at me.

1924
01:35:53.051 --> 01:35:55.285
I'm thinking of
taking a run at that
now that I'm living in my van.


1925
01:35:55.287 --> 01:35:57.220
Yeah, women can't resist that.

1926
01:35:58.223 --> 01:35:59.622
Strike two!

1927
01:35:59.624 --> 01:36:00.990
You think, uh...

1928
01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:04.560
you think that
she would go out with me?


1929
01:36:04.562 --> 01:36:06.129
Well, actually,

1930
01:36:06.131 --> 01:36:07.497
we've kind of been
seeing each other.


1931
01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.233
You?

1932
01:36:10.235 --> 01:36:12.201
And Mrs. Timmy?

1933
01:36:12.203 --> 01:36:14.604
Carolyn.

1934
01:36:14.606 --> 01:36:16.406
Carolyn!

1935
01:36:17.892 --> 01:36:19.375
Must be serious
if you know her first name.


1936
01:36:20.312 --> 01:36:21.644
That's good.

1937
01:36:21.646 --> 01:36:23.379
That's good. I'm, I'm...

1938
01:36:23.381 --> 01:36:25.048
happy for you.

1939
01:36:25.050 --> 01:36:26.549
-Really, Don?
-Yeah.


1940
01:36:26.551 --> 01:36:28.551
After all, you spent some time
with her in a Subaru.


1941
01:36:28.553 --> 01:36:30.119
Ah...

1942
01:36:30.121 --> 01:36:31.521
Never actually happened.

1943
01:36:32.991 --> 01:36:34.691
-Uh-oh.
-What?


1944
01:36:34.693 --> 01:36:36.292
Bases loaded. Look who's up.

1945
01:36:36.294 --> 01:36:37.994
Now batting for the Cardinals

1946
01:36:37.996 --> 01:36:40.296
is Ralph "Boom Boom" Johnson.

1947
01:36:40.298 --> 01:36:42.231
¶ ¶

1948
01:36:47.038 --> 01:36:48.137
That's two outs!

1949
01:36:48.139 --> 01:36:49.572
Play at any base.

1950
01:36:49.574 --> 01:36:51.708
Bear down, get this last one.
Come on, boys.


1951
01:36:51.710 --> 01:36:53.042
C'mon, we're gonna
win this one!


1952
01:36:53.044 --> 01:36:54.410
C'mon, Kahil, you can do this!

1953
01:36:54.412 --> 01:36:55.478
Strike him out!

1954
01:37:04.122 --> 01:37:06.422
¶ ¶

1955
01:37:14.733 --> 01:37:16.666
You got it, Frankie!
It's all yours!


1956
01:37:17.602 --> 01:37:19.002
Oh, dear God.

1957
01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:23.673
Please, let him catch this ball.

1958
01:37:25.443 --> 01:37:28.011
Please, let him catch this ball.

1959
01:37:28.013 --> 01:37:29.245
Just once.

1960
01:37:29.247 --> 01:37:30.413
Let him know what it feels like

1961
01:37:30.415 --> 01:37:33.750
to have the ball
stay in his glove.


1962
01:37:33.752 --> 01:37:37.420
Let him have this one memory
for the rest of his life.


1963
01:37:37.422 --> 01:37:40.590
The night the ball fell into
his glove and stayed there.


1964
01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.292
Check your stats, God.

1965
01:37:43.294 --> 01:37:44.527
He's 12 years old.

1966
01:37:44.529 --> 01:37:46.229
His first and last year
at Ripken League.


1967
01:37:46.231 --> 01:37:48.264
No team for my boy next year.

1968
01:37:48.266 --> 01:37:49.332
This is it.

1969
01:37:49.334 --> 01:37:51.267
This is a small request.

1970
01:37:51.269 --> 01:37:53.169
Last year, I asked you
to let my wife live,


1971
01:37:53.171 --> 01:37:54.637
and yeah, that was a big one.

1972
01:37:54.639 --> 01:37:57.440
And I'm sure you had
your reasons for what happened.


1973
01:37:57.442 --> 01:37:59.809
Which I try to respect,
but I'll never understand.


1974
01:38:01.212 --> 01:38:02.678
But, this should be
a no-brainer.


1975
01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.147
Bases are loaded.

1976
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:05.748
Frankie's already
struck out three times,


1977
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:08.751
plus a ball got by him,
went all the way to the fence.


1978
01:38:08.753 --> 01:38:11.054
Bad hop, not his fault.

1979
01:38:11.056 --> 01:38:13.189
One more example of your
peculiar sense of humor,


1980
01:38:13.191 --> 01:38:15.491
which has caused so much
hilarity through the ages.


1981
01:38:17.062 --> 01:38:18.661
I need to feel hope.

1982
01:38:18.663 --> 01:38:21.297
I wanna know there's
a purpose for all this.


1983
01:38:21.299 --> 01:38:23.099
For the dropped fly balls

1984
01:38:23.101 --> 01:38:26.135
and the endless hours
in the hospital waiting room.


1985
01:38:26.137 --> 01:38:28.237
I don't need much.

1986
01:38:28.239 --> 01:38:30.173
Just a quick thumbs up
from the home office.


1987
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:32.575
Just once,

1988
01:38:32.577 --> 01:38:34.544
I need this boy
to catch this ball.


1989
01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.846
Please.

1990
01:38:36.848 --> 01:38:38.114
¶ ¶

1991
01:38:46.391 --> 01:38:47.690
Ah! Ha-ha-ha!

1992
01:38:52.697 --> 01:38:55.264
Nice catch, Frankie! Huh?

1993
01:38:55.266 --> 01:38:57.433
Nice catch, kid! Attaboy!

1994
01:38:59.337 --> 01:39:01.871
Holy cow!

1995
01:39:01.873 --> 01:39:05.141
Woo! Good job, Frankie!

1996
01:39:05.143 --> 01:39:07.477
Oh my God.

1997
01:39:08.413 --> 01:39:09.812
Nice catch, Frankie.

1998
01:39:10.748 --> 01:39:12.448
Nice catch, Frankie.

1999
01:39:14.452 --> 01:39:18.754
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!

2000
01:39:18.756 --> 01:39:20.706
Proud of you.

2001
01:39:20.707 --> 01:39:22.657
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!


2002
01:39:35.473 --> 01:39:37.173
-Strike!
-All right, Phillip,


2003
01:39:37.175 --> 01:39:38.774
if you like it, drive it.

2004
01:39:38.776 --> 01:39:40.676
If it's bad, just let it go by!

2005
01:39:40.678 --> 01:39:43.513
You're up there to hit, pal.
You're up there to hit.


2006
01:39:43.515 --> 01:39:45.781
Walk's just as good
as a hit, Phillip.


2007
01:39:45.783 --> 01:39:47.483
Got a full count on the batter.

2008
01:39:54.526 --> 01:39:56.659
- Ball four. All right, kid.
Take your base.
- Come on down.


2009
01:39:56.661 --> 01:39:58.828
See? Good eye!
Good eye! Atta kid.


2010
01:39:58.830 --> 01:40:01.464
Good eye.
Walk's as good as a hit.


2011
01:40:01.466 --> 01:40:02.932
It's the bottom of the sixth.

2012
01:40:02.934 --> 01:40:05.301
Two outs,
Cardinals lead by one run.


2013
01:40:05.303 --> 01:40:07.737
-Woo!
-Up to bat for the Pirates,


2014
01:40:07.739 --> 01:40:09.272
Timmy Clark.

2015
01:40:09.274 --> 01:40:10.640
A very important point.

2016
01:40:10.642 --> 01:40:11.674
If the ball's on the ground,

2017
01:40:11.676 --> 01:40:13.643
I want you going,
you understand?


2018
01:40:13.645 --> 01:40:15.161
I want you going.

2019
01:40:15.162 --> 01:40:16.678
When you get around third
you look at Coach Mike,


2020
01:40:16.681 --> 01:40:18.181
he'll tell you
what to do. Okay?


2021
01:40:18.183 --> 01:40:19.815
That's key. Look at Coach Mike.

2022
01:40:19.817 --> 01:40:20.883
Take your primary.

2023
01:40:23.254 --> 01:40:24.587
Hey, Timmy!

2024
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:26.255
¶ ¶

2025
01:40:34.832 --> 01:40:36.632
Hit away. Just hit away.

2026
01:40:39.437 --> 01:40:40.503
¶ ¶

2027
01:40:46.744 --> 01:40:48.878
Oh!

2028
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.279
Go, go, go, go, Phillip! Go!

2029
01:40:50.281 --> 01:40:52.748
Go, Phillip, go! Go!

2030
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:53.983
You can catch base!

2031
01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.619
Keep it coming! 
Keep it coming!

2032
01:40:56.621 --> 01:40:58.621
-Go, Timmy, go! Go!
-Hurry, hurry!


2033
01:41:04.896 --> 01:41:07.997
¶ ¶

2034
01:41:20.778 --> 01:41:23.246
All right, Pirates.

2035
01:41:23.248 --> 01:41:25.314
I know that didn't turn out
the way we were hoping.


2036
01:41:26.718 --> 01:41:28.784
But I am so proud of
each and every one of you.


2037
01:41:29.787 --> 01:41:32.321
You taught me a lot this season.

2038
01:41:32.323 --> 01:41:33.856
I think you played
the game of your lives.


2039
01:41:33.858 --> 01:41:35.524
¶ ¶

2040
01:41:37.295 --> 01:41:38.928
Thank you for teaching me
to be a better coach.


2041
01:41:39.864 --> 01:41:41.497
I'll never forget this season.

2042
01:41:42.567 --> 01:41:44.734
I hope you don't either.
All right!


2043
01:41:44.736 --> 01:41:46.636
Get out there and shake hands
with the other team,


2044
01:41:46.638 --> 01:41:48.471
'cause they played great, too.

2045
01:41:52.644 --> 01:41:55.711
Good game. Good game. Good game.
Good game. Good game. Good game.


2046
01:42:01.486 --> 01:42:03.452
¶ ¶

2047
01:42:11.796 --> 01:42:13.729
Guess I shouldn't
have sent Phillip home.


2048
01:42:13.731 --> 01:42:15.765
Ah, he'd have made it easy
if he didn't trip.


2049
01:42:15.767 --> 01:42:18.067
All season long, he's been
resistant to double-knotting.


2050
01:42:18.069 --> 01:42:21.003
-I don't know why.
-Hey, uh...


2051
01:42:21.005 --> 01:42:23.406
Did you see what happened
after Phillip was out?


2052
01:42:23.408 --> 01:42:24.473
No.

2053
01:42:25.777 --> 01:42:27.910
He just went down
to the end of the bench,


2054
01:42:27.912 --> 01:42:29.679
and he sat there,

2055
01:42:29.681 --> 01:42:30.713
all alone.

2056
01:42:31.649 --> 01:42:32.715
And then,

2057
01:42:32.717 --> 01:42:33.883
Timor went down with him.

2058
01:42:35.086 --> 01:42:36.352
And then Eric.

2059
01:42:37.655 --> 01:42:39.388
And then Frankie.

2060
01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:40.556
What did they say?

2061
01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:43.426
Didn't say anything.

2062
01:42:45.363 --> 01:42:46.495
They were just there.

2063
01:42:48.066 --> 01:42:49.932
They were a team.

2064
01:42:49.934 --> 01:42:52.368
Ah, I love this team.

2065
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:53.703
Me too.

2066
01:43:00.712 --> 01:43:01.744
Uh...

2067
01:43:01.746 --> 01:43:03.646
Good game, Coach.

2068
01:43:05.717 --> 01:43:06.949
Yeah, thanks.

2069
01:43:14.792 --> 01:43:16.626
Hey, Mike!

2070
01:43:16.627 --> 01:43:18.461
Would it be okay
if Frankie came to our house?


2071
01:43:18.463 --> 01:43:20.629
I can grab a pizza,
and you can pick him up later.


2072
01:43:20.631 --> 01:43:22.998
Yeah. Okay.

2073
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:24.967
Okay.

2074
01:43:24.969 --> 01:43:26.435
Right! You guys ready?

2075
01:43:27.505 --> 01:43:28.571
Okay.

2076
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:34.510
So, you around next week, Don?

2077
01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:37.546
Find a good place to park.

2078
01:43:38.483 --> 01:43:39.548
Why?

2079
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:41.384
I'll give you a call.

2080
01:43:42.453 --> 01:43:43.552
Why?

2081
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:45.654
We get together.

2082
01:43:45.656 --> 01:43:46.789
Why?

2083
01:43:48.426 --> 01:43:50.159
I don't know.
Get a pizza or something.


2084
01:43:50.161 --> 01:43:51.994
Do whatever people do
when they get together.


2085
01:44:01.005 --> 01:44:02.505
I'm gonna say something here,
Mike.


2086
01:44:03.708 --> 01:44:04.740
Okay.

2087
01:44:08.146 --> 01:44:09.779
There is no reason

2088
01:44:10.882 --> 01:44:12.481
for us to get together.

2089
01:44:13.684 --> 01:44:14.850
See...

2090
01:44:16.654 --> 01:44:18.687
I don't really consider you

2091
01:44:18.689 --> 01:44:20.856
a friend,
and I think, if you're honest,


2092
01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.759
you will find that

2093
01:44:23.761 --> 01:44:25.661
you don't really consider me
a friend either.


2094
01:44:25.663 --> 01:44:27.129
Of course I do. 
Why wouldn't I?

2095
01:44:27.131 --> 01:44:29.198
Oh, please, Mike...

2096
01:44:31.469 --> 01:44:32.902
I'm asking you to be honest.

2097
01:44:33.838 --> 01:44:35.037
And that's a hard thing.

2098
01:44:36.974 --> 01:44:38.474
So, I shouldn't call you?

2099
01:44:40.678 --> 01:44:42.111
I thought we were getting
to be friends.


2100
01:44:46.150 --> 01:44:47.817
I thought Tony was my friend.

2101
01:44:53.491 --> 01:44:54.523
See, Mike...

2102
01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:58.761
There comes a time for
every man who lives in his van,


2103
01:45:00.598 --> 01:45:02.498
when he wants to know the truth.

2104
01:45:04.101 --> 01:45:05.701
And the truth is...

2105
01:45:06.637 --> 01:45:08.237
that you and I could never be...

2106
01:45:09.974 --> 01:45:11.207
friends.

2107
01:45:13.110 --> 01:45:14.677
I guess if I'm being honest...

2108
01:45:17.648 --> 01:45:19.582
there were plenty of times
I dreaded coming here


2109
01:45:19.584 --> 01:45:21.083
because I knew
it meant seeing you.


2110
01:45:22.086 --> 01:45:23.252
I didn't know what to say.

2111
01:45:23.254 --> 01:45:24.620
See?

2112
01:45:26.824 --> 01:45:29.091
Isn't that better?

2113
01:45:29.093 --> 01:45:31.193
Isn't that better than
some bullshit friendship


2114
01:45:31.195 --> 01:45:34.196
where you gotta fake stuff like
caring about another person?


2115
01:45:36.133 --> 01:45:37.700
I mean, it's a pretty big thing.

2116
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:41.804
We can tell each other
the truth.


2117
01:45:41.806 --> 01:45:44.507
I never knew not being friends
could offer so much.


2118
01:45:48.045 --> 01:45:49.211
Oh, damn.

2119
01:45:50.615 --> 01:45:51.914
I...

2120
01:45:51.916 --> 01:45:53.015
Oh.

2121
01:45:53.017 --> 01:45:55.951
I forgot to give out the snacks.

2122
01:45:55.953 --> 01:45:59.722
Snacks are an integral part
of the baseball experience.


2123
01:46:01.192 --> 01:46:02.758
Well, I just figured,

2124
01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:03.893
it's the last game.

2125
01:46:05.630 --> 01:46:06.829
Guys should have the best.

2126
01:46:07.832 --> 01:46:08.931
So, I, uh...

2127
01:46:13.137 --> 01:46:14.703
I broke into the house
last night,


2128
01:46:14.705 --> 01:46:16.138
and I cooked these up myself.

2129
01:46:20.912 --> 01:46:23.178
Well, that's a positive step.

2130
01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:24.947
You and Linda spending
some time together.


2131
01:46:25.883 --> 01:46:26.949
Whether she knew it or not.

2132
01:46:30.555 --> 01:46:31.820
Felt nice being back.

2133
01:46:33.257 --> 01:46:34.323
I, uh...

2134
01:46:36.928 --> 01:46:38.561
sat in all my favorite chairs.

2135
01:46:43.834 --> 01:46:45.000
Well...

2136
01:46:45.002 --> 01:46:46.168
When I got to the van,

2137
01:46:48.739 --> 01:46:50.172
I threw a hammer at the house.

2138
01:46:53.644 --> 01:46:54.643
How come?

2139
01:46:54.644 --> 01:46:55.643
Right there, handy,
in the front seat.


2140
01:46:59.150 --> 01:47:01.984
Well, these things take time.

2141
01:47:06.757 --> 01:47:07.823
Yeah.

2142
01:47:45.096 --> 01:47:49.031
¶ Take me out
to the ball game ¶

2143
01:47:49.033 --> 01:47:52.968
¶ Take me out to the crowd ¶

2144
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:56.872
¶ Buy me some peanuts
and Cracker Jacks ¶


2145
01:47:56.874 --> 01:48:00.175
¶ I don't care
if I ever get back ¶


2146
01:48:00.177 --> 01:48:04.313
¶ For it's root, root, root
for the home team ¶


2147
01:48:04.315 --> 01:48:08.017
¶ If they don't win,
it's a shame ¶


2148
01:48:08.019 --> 01:48:12.021
¶ For it's one, two,
three strikes you're out ¶


2149
01:48:12.023 --> 01:48:14.390
¶ At the old ¶

2150
01:48:14.392 --> 01:48:16.291
¶ Ball ¶

2151
01:48:16.293 --> 01:48:20.663
¶ Game ¶

2152
01:48:23.801 --> 01:48:27.936
¶ For it's root, root, root
for the home team ¶


2153
01:48:27.938 --> 01:48:31.373
¶ If they don't win,
it's a shame ¶


2154
01:48:31.375 --> 01:48:35.377
¶ For it's one, two,
three strikes, you're out ¶


2155
01:48:35.379 --> 01:48:38.013
¶ At the old ¶

2156
01:48:38.015 --> 01:48:39.848
¶ Ball ¶

2157
01:48:39.850 --> 01:48:43.819
¶ Game ¶

2158
01:48:44.755 --> 01:48:46.088
¶ Let's play ball! ¶

2159
01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:57.833
¶ I got the
gold in my hand ¶

2160
01:48:57.835 --> 01:49:00.102
¶ Second place will never do ¶

2161
01:49:02.406 --> 01:49:05.007
¶ You got the silver
and the bronze, baby ¶


2162
01:49:05.009 --> 01:49:07.109
¶ That's good enough for you ¶

2163
01:49:09.346 --> 01:49:10.979
¶ Worked too hard, too long ¶

2164
01:49:10.981 --> 01:49:13.882
¶ Came too far
just to turn back now ¶


2165
01:49:15.753 --> 01:49:17.753
¶ I want the power
and the glory ¶


2166
01:49:17.755 --> 01:49:19.221
¶ And it ain't no sin ¶

2167
01:49:19.223 --> 01:49:20.923
¶ I'm a new sensation ¶

2168
01:49:20.925 --> 01:49:23.392
¶ Came to win, win,
win, win, win ¶


2169
01:49:28.866 --> 01:49:31.333
¶ The opposition's
in your way, baby ¶


2170
01:49:31.335 --> 01:49:33.469
¶ But they are always there ¶

2171
01:49:35.506 --> 01:49:37.940
¶ Keep your eyes
on the dream, sonny ¶


2172
01:49:37.942 --> 01:49:40.743
¶ 'Cause none of them
don't care ¶


2173
01:49:40.745 --> 01:49:42.211
¶ No ¶

2174
01:49:42.213 --> 01:49:43.946
¶ Worked too hard, too long ¶

2175
01:49:43.948 --> 01:49:46.815
¶ Came too far
just to turn back now ¶


2176
01:49:48.452 --> 01:49:50.486
¶ You want the power
and the glory ¶


2177
01:49:50.488 --> 01:49:52.020
¶ And it ain't no sin ¶

2178
01:49:52.022 --> 01:49:53.822
¶ You're the new sensation ¶

2179
01:49:53.824 --> 01:49:56.358
¶ Came to win, win,
win, win, win ¶


2180
01:50:02.299 --> 01:50:03.365
¶ Uh ¶

2181
01:50:06.504 --> 01:50:07.770
¶ Yeah ¶

2182
01:50:13.077 --> 01:50:14.143
¶ Uh ¶

2183
01:50:15.079 --> 01:50:16.779
¶ Worked too hard, too long ¶

2184
01:50:16.781 --> 01:50:19.448
¶ Came too far
just to turn back now ¶


2185
01:50:20.384 --> 01:50:22.818
¶ Uh, uh, uh ¶

2186
01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:27.523
¶ Yeah ¶
