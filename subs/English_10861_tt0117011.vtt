1
00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:02.676
- Move! Move it!
- Let's go!


2
00:03:14.732 --> 00:03:16.495
Jesus Christ!

3
00:03:25.877 --> 00:03:27.504
Loomis!

4
00:05:12.272 --> 00:05:14.797
I need you to come with me.

5
00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:17.309
Just a minute.

6
00:05:19.062 --> 00:05:22.260
It's Sophie.
Sophie thinks I have a mistress.


7
00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:23.873
You're worried about that?

8
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.026
If you lived with Sophie,
you'd understand.


9
00:05:26.803 --> 00:05:29.533
Sometimes I yearn for our bachelor days
in the army.


10
00:05:29.606 --> 00:05:34.908
We were happy there, no?
Well, I was happy! But you...


11
00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:37.876
I wonder if you've ever been happy.

12
00:05:37.948 --> 00:05:41.008
No. It's not Sophie
that worries me today.


13
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.812
Then what?

14
00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:57.691
- Who is he?
- I thought he was you.


15
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.933
Especially when we couldn't find you.

16
00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:06.008
Then one of my men told me
you were at Major Lescourt's funeral.


17
00:06:06.077 --> 00:06:10.413
I thought it was a sick joke.
I almost fired him.


18
00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:14.417
But who is he?

19
00:06:18.218 --> 00:06:19.010
Come on.

20
00:06:20.023 --> 00:06:22.022
We are talking to witnesses.

21
00:06:22.093 --> 00:06:23.557
Apparently he was being chased.

22
00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:27.773
There's evidence he had been tortured.
His death was not an easy one.


23
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.718
Here's the bag, sir.

24
00:06:31.287 --> 00:06:34.154
This was found
in the victim's pockets.


25
00:06:34.223 --> 00:06:37.420
These matches are from
the Hotel Chevre d'Or.


26
00:06:37.493 --> 00:06:39.961
- Our men are there now.
- Let's go.


27
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:42.623
Alain, wait.
This is not your case.


28
00:06:42.698 --> 00:06:45.098
I'm not sure I want you involved
at this point.


29
00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:48.295
I am involved!
Did you see his face?


30
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.904
Are you coming or what?

31
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.882
Monsieur Suverov, thank God!

32
00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:14.190
This man told me you were killed
in a car accident.


33
00:07:14.264 --> 00:07:17.461
- Good morning, sir.
- You only had your hair cut!


34
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.371
Yes. Mikhail Suverov.

35
00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.431
Now if you want access
to his room...


36
00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:27.909
why don't you ask Monsieur Suverov?

37
00:07:27.978 --> 00:07:31.880
Good idea.
May we search your room, sir?


38
00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:33.883
But of course.

39
00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:38.488
I trust my map to the street
you asked for was satisfactory?


40
00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:40.491
It was. Thank you.

41
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.790
- Did I get any messages?
- Oh, yes. A telephone message.


42
00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:49.423
Alex Bohemia.

43
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:52.567
- Did he leave a number?
- No


44
00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.568
Thank you.

45
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:01.469
You heard that woman. This Suverov
must have been looking for me.


46
00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:08.845
A stranger with your exact face...

47
00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:12.379
and according to the passport,
your exact birth date...


48
00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:16.554
comes here and asks for directions
to the very street where you live.


49
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:19.063
A mystery, yes?

50
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:22.996
An airline ticket
from Nice to New York...


51
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.470
and a New York driver's license.

52
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:29.771
Some U.S. Cash.

53
00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:40.610
He was born five minutes after you.

54
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.416
I kept both of you for three months.

55
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.258
But I was sick.
I couldn't nurse.


56
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.424
There wasn't even enough
for one of you.


57
00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:58.065
I needed the money.
I had to do it.


58
00:09:00.776 --> 00:09:04.405
Tell me now.
Why did you choose me?


59
00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:08.541
I didn't!
I didn't have the courage.


60
00:09:08.617 --> 00:09:10.778
Somebody else did it for me.

61
00:09:10.853 --> 00:09:13.617
- Somebody else?
- A lawyer from Paris.


62
00:09:13.689 --> 00:09:17.523
He picked up your brother because...

63
00:09:17.593 --> 00:09:19.322
you were crying.

64
00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:23.627
He saw my distress
and offered me money.


65
00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:25.758
He said it was a good family.

66
00:09:26.303 --> 00:09:27.964
Oh, God!

67
00:09:29.372 --> 00:09:31.499
What have I done?

68
00:09:42.252 --> 00:09:43.776
You survived.

69
00:09:44.855 --> 00:09:46.789
Made a home for me.

70
00:09:48.193 --> 00:09:53.324
You did what you had to do.
I don't blame you.


71
00:09:56.635 --> 00:09:59.365
You should've told me.

72
00:09:59.437 --> 00:10:01.132
I know.

73
00:10:02.207 --> 00:10:05.142
Can you remember his name, the lawyer?

74
00:10:06.544 --> 00:10:07.977
Why?

75
00:10:08.046 --> 00:10:11.277
Somebody killed him, Mother.

76
00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:14.785
He was trying to come home.
They killed him.


77
00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:19.387
Alain, please.

78
00:10:23.062 --> 00:10:25.053
Can you remember his name?

79
00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:27.893
Etienne St. Denis.

80
00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:32.563
He had an office
in Place Pigalle in Paris.


81
00:10:40.213 --> 00:10:42.977
Parents always lie
to their children...


82
00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:46.416
to prepare them for the way they'll
be treated later by the government.


83
00:10:46.436 --> 00:10:48.531
Maybe I'm wasting my time.

84
00:10:48.605 --> 00:10:53.099
But if I don't go now,
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.


85
00:10:53.176 --> 00:10:55.940
What do you gain?
You only open old wounds.


86
00:10:56.012 --> 00:10:57.676
The lawyer can't bring him back.

87
00:10:57.848 --> 00:11:03.115
My brother was adopted. If I can find
his family, I can learn about him.


88
00:11:03.187 --> 00:11:06.054
Kind of get to know him.

89
00:11:24.943 --> 00:11:27.935
The lawyer's office
is on the sixth floor.


90
00:11:28.013 --> 00:11:32.245
Remember, I'll do the talking. Okay?
And then seafood.


91
00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:35.047
Promise. Seafood before we go home.

92
00:12:22.003 --> 00:12:24.028
Get out! Get out!

93
00:12:24.105 --> 00:12:25.595
Go! Go!

94
00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:29.608
The man in the elevator!

95
00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:32.844
Help!

96
00:12:32.914 --> 00:12:35.041
Please help!

97
00:12:59.707 --> 00:13:01.140
Help me!

98
00:13:21.298 --> 00:13:23.459
Don't hurt me!

99
00:13:25.101 --> 00:13:28.628
The adoption papers are here.
My boss made me hide them.


100
00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:30.570
He would not give them to anybody.

101
00:13:31.842 --> 00:13:33.776
Stay with me.

102
00:13:33.844 --> 00:13:35.607
You'll be safe.

103
00:13:41.218 --> 00:13:43.083
Come on, let's go.

104
00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:10.575
My God!

105
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.675
Let's go.

106
00:15:18.787 --> 00:15:20.584
Come on.

107
00:15:46.349 --> 00:15:48.340
They've checked the entire floor.

108
00:15:48.417 --> 00:15:51.011
There's no one in there.
No body, nothing.


109
00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:55.579
The secretary said a Russian guy showed
up, asked her boss a lot of questions.


110
00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:59.253
Got upset with him.
Locked her in her room.


111
00:15:59.328 --> 00:16:02.593
The next thing she knew,
the place was on fire.


112
00:16:02.665 --> 00:16:04.826
Have you gone through
every piece of debris in the office?


113
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.993
- We'll keep looking.
- Good.


114
00:16:08.338 --> 00:16:10.568
He was adopted by a Russian family.

115
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.872
The father was a Soviet diplomat
who lived in Paris for five years...


116
00:16:14.944 --> 00:16:18.402
and then immigrated
to America in 1968.


117
00:16:18.481 --> 00:16:20.415
When's the flight?

118
00:16:20.483 --> 00:16:23.384
- What flight?
- Mikhail's flight to New York.


119
00:16:24.874 --> 00:16:28.173
- I want his passport.
- No! You're a cop. That's evidence.


120
00:16:28.245 --> 00:16:30.505
You think it was a coincidence
that guy was Russian?


121
00:16:30.581 --> 00:16:32.449
Who knows what Mikhail
was involved in.


122
00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:34.812
Sebastien...

123
00:16:34.885 --> 00:16:37.945
what happened to my brother
could've happened to me.


124
00:16:38.022 --> 00:16:42.959
Thirty-two years ago it was only luck
that kept me in France.


125
00:16:43.027 --> 00:16:45.552
He made a sacrifice
and never knew it.


126
00:16:46.632 --> 00:16:48.190
I gotta go.

127
00:16:49.201 --> 00:16:53.638
The killer did not know Mikhail is dead.
You go to New York with that face and...


128
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.965
Maybe he isn't.

129
00:17:10.623 --> 00:17:14.582
Would you like a vodka
before you sleep, Mr. Suverov?


130
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.254
- No, thank you.
- You're welcome.


131
00:17:40.387 --> 00:17:43.049
What you see before you
is called gridlock.


132
00:17:43.124 --> 00:17:45.024
- Next exit.
- Yeah, yeah.


133
00:17:45.092 --> 00:17:47.652
I'm writing the great American novel
here on the job.


134
00:17:47.728 --> 00:17:50.196
Literary kind of stuff.
Knock the fillings outta your teeth.


135
00:17:50.264 --> 00:17:52.494
Yeah. I see everything.

136
00:17:52.566 --> 00:17:56.229
That's what it is. It's all about
looking around, observing stuff.


137
00:17:56.303 --> 00:18:00.262
Take you, for instance.
Like that accent of yours.


138
00:18:00.341 --> 00:18:04.573
What's that? Don't tell me.
That's European or something?


139
00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:07.205
Bet you got a story to tell.

140
00:18:07.281 --> 00:18:09.806
This is Davis Hartley here.

141
00:18:09.884 --> 00:18:10.745
I'm not some nickel and dime
street mutt.


142
00:18:10.619 --> 00:18:13.554
I'm not trying to rip you off
or anything.


143
00:18:13.622 --> 00:18:17.114
It would be stupid. A guy like you?
Got a couple pounds of lead in his eyes?


144
00:18:17.192 --> 00:18:20.593
What's that? Is that maybe grief
or something like that?


145
00:18:20.663 --> 00:18:23.154
- You want to talk about it?
- No


146
00:18:27.269 --> 00:18:31.569
Maybe you think I'm trying to rip off
your experiences to put 'em in my novel.


147
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.577
But that's not true. Davis Hartley
is not some moral cretin.


148
00:18:36.645 --> 00:18:38.840
Not precisely.

149
00:18:38.914 --> 00:18:39.905
I'm trying to make a point here.

150
00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:43.552
I'm a professional New York City
cab driver. You know what that means?


151
00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:47.146
I'm the greatest individual at being
able to find anything in the world.


152
00:18:47.223 --> 00:18:48.351
I could find a penguin
in a sandstorm.


153
00:18:48.425 --> 00:18:51.360
- I don't know what a penguin would be...
- Stop talking.


154
00:18:51.428 --> 00:18:54.192
Please stop talking!
Hello! Stop talking!


155
00:18:54.265 --> 00:18:59.601
You want to help? After I stop,
I'll be busy for a while.


156
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.638
Find a guy named...

157
00:19:02.706 --> 00:19:04.471
Alex Bohemia.

158
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.378
Who do you think I am?
Do you think I'm a magician?


159
00:19:08.445 --> 00:19:12.882
New York City is a big place.
How am I supposed to find Alex Bohemia?


160
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.046
Kind of like finding a penguin
in a sandstorm.


161
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.299
You sure you got the right address?

162
00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:44.238
You boys think this is Atlantic City?

163
00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:47.251
Jeremy, pick up your milk money
and get inside!


164
00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.788
I'm sorry. I'm looking for...

165
00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:55.550
You're in the wrong neighborhood, man!

166
00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.429
I'm looking for a family.
Maybe...


167
00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:01.726
Wack accent!

168
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.826
You way out of your 'hood,
white boy.


169
00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:06.894
You crazy or what?

170
00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:09.566
Or maybe you're a cop?

171
00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:12.701
Hey! Get the hell out from my building,
you little shits!


172
00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:15.246
Come on, old man!
He's the chump.


173
00:20:17.017 --> 00:20:19.918
- Thank you.
- Chump.


174
00:20:21.755 --> 00:20:23.188
Thanks.

175
00:20:23.257 --> 00:20:25.851
They're not scared of you.
They don't know who you are.


176
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.596
- They're supposed to be scared?
- Everybody supposed to be scared of you.


177
00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:32.393
- Why?
- Why?


178
00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:36.800
Please! Big-time gangster like you!
Rich.


179
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.065
I thought you forgot about us.

180
00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:42.472
I haven't seen you here
in a long time.


181
00:20:42.977 --> 00:20:44.911
I'm not who you think I am.

182
00:20:48.182 --> 00:20:51.208
Well, when his family disappeared...

183
00:20:51.285 --> 00:20:53.378
there was a lot of rumors.

184
00:20:54.489 --> 00:20:57.652
Some said they had gone back
to Russia.


185
00:20:57.725 --> 00:21:01.058
Others said there was trouble
with their grocery in Little Odessa.


186
00:21:01.129 --> 00:21:05.088
Russian mob controls everything
in Little Odessa.


187
00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:07.191
Maybe that's why he joined them.

188
00:21:07.937 --> 00:21:12.374
- How old was he?
- Sixteen. Forced to live on the street.


189
00:21:12.441 --> 00:21:15.842
You gotta be strong to be a white boy
growing up in this neighborhood.


190
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:17.902
Did he ever mention me?

191
00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:19.503
No.

192
00:21:33.097 --> 00:21:34.962
Your brother's.

193
00:21:35.032 --> 00:21:37.432
He kept it here all these years.

194
00:21:41.638 --> 00:21:43.868
- Was he happy?
- Yeah.


195
00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:48.901
The last I saw him, he had matured.
Got real serious.


196
00:21:52.182 --> 00:21:55.276
- But he had choices.
- What choices?


197
00:21:55.352 --> 00:21:58.549
- He was alone.
- I'd have taken him in.


198
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.919
He was a strange boy.

199
00:22:01.892 --> 00:22:04.588
You should go back to France.

200
00:22:04.662 --> 00:22:07.028
What you find here could be ugly.

201
00:22:08.901 --> 00:22:12.598
Did he ever mention someone
named Alex Bohemia?


202
00:22:15.741 --> 00:22:18.642
No. But there's a nightclub in Little Odessa
called the Bohemia.


203
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.325
Your vodka, Mr. Suverov.

204
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:18.466
Excuse me, I'm looking...

205
00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:22.942
Mr. Suverov, you have a phone call.
Follow me.


206
00:23:37.091 --> 00:23:38.524
Mikhail.

207
00:23:45.067 --> 00:23:48.730
Are you crazy? What the hell
are you thinking coming in here?


208
00:23:57.179 --> 00:24:00.273
The key wasn't in the mailbox
'cause Darlene didn't show up tonight...


209
00:24:00.349 --> 00:24:03.011
so I don't get a break
for another 20 minutes.


210
00:24:03.085 --> 00:24:04.416
Here.

211
00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.565
You might as well take it now.

212
00:24:09.309 --> 00:24:13.040
You shouldn't have come!
You should've looked for the key later.


213
00:24:13.113 --> 00:24:16.412
What's the matter?
You all right?


214
00:24:16.483 --> 00:24:18.075
- Excuse me.
- Alex.


215
00:24:25.693 --> 00:24:28.685
You probably gave half of those
bent-nose guys up there a heart attack.


216
00:24:28.762 --> 00:24:31.287
I'm surprised we weren't trampled
on the way to the phone.


217
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.793
You better get outta here.

218
00:24:36.337 --> 00:24:38.328
I'll see you soon as I get off.

219
00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:41.705
Don't even think about going to sleep.
We got a lot of catching up to do.


220
00:24:42.576 --> 00:24:45.204
Just tell me.
Is everything going to be okay?


221
00:24:47.715 --> 00:24:49.239
Get outta here!

222
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.579
You need to go back inside.
Ivan wants to talk to you.


223
00:25:24.654 --> 00:25:27.885
We were family!
You betrayed us.


224
00:25:50.518 --> 00:25:51.780
Enough.

225
00:25:56.457 --> 00:25:58.186
Enough!

226
00:26:04.265 --> 00:26:07.530
This is your lucky day.

227
00:26:14.108 --> 00:26:15.575
Get in!

228
00:26:26.288 --> 00:26:28.882
That was dynamite.

229
00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:31.791
Any of those guys Alex Bohemia?

230
00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:34.694
Good. I guess that would've been
structural letdown, huh?


231
00:26:34.763 --> 00:26:36.697
You know this place?

232
00:26:36.765 --> 00:26:39.529
Yeah. It's a fleabag hotel.

233
00:26:39.602 --> 00:26:42.366
They say that Bret Easton Ellis,
he got drunk...


234
00:26:42.438 --> 00:26:44.565
and he threw up in a fig tree.

235
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.370
The thing won't stop growing.
They got to keep trimming it.


236
00:26:47.443 --> 00:26:49.707
- Just relax.
- He's a very good writer.


237
00:26:49.778 --> 00:26:53.339
Just relax. Thanks.

238
00:27:10.417 --> 00:27:13.909
- I'll wait here for you.
- Thank you for your help.


239
00:27:13.988 --> 00:27:16.081
Wait. We're not done yet.

240
00:27:16.156 --> 00:27:19.853
We gotta find Alex.
My whole first chapter hangs on that.


241
00:27:19.927 --> 00:27:23.954
Go home and use your imagination
for chapter one.


242
00:27:42.884 --> 00:27:47.617
Hi. Last time I was here
I stayed in room 323.


243
00:27:47.688 --> 00:27:51.818
Kind of a good luck thing.
It's available?


244
00:27:52.227 --> 00:27:55.355
Nope. But I got 305
across the hall.


245
00:27:56.598 --> 00:27:58.088
That's fine.

246
00:28:00.369 --> 00:28:01.631
Sign.

247
00:28:15.551 --> 00:28:17.485
Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov.

248
00:28:17.553 --> 00:28:19.783
You're a very pretty girl, Alex.
You know that?


249
00:28:19.855 --> 00:28:21.288
Thank you.

250
00:28:22.125 --> 00:28:25.219
Will you do me a favor?
The band is too loud.


251
00:28:25.295 --> 00:28:27.695
It's a birthday party.

252
00:28:28.631 --> 00:28:30.565
The band is too loud.

253
00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:41.906
Ten minutes, Yuri.

254
00:28:42.946 --> 00:28:44.971
Ten minutes.

255
00:28:45.048 --> 00:28:48.017
All I asked was that
you hold Mikhail...


256
00:28:48.085 --> 00:28:50.645
for ten minutes.

257
00:28:50.721 --> 00:28:52.951
Is that a long time?

258
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.027
No. That is a very short time.

259
00:29:02.334 --> 00:29:04.666
How long can you hold your breath?

260
00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:15.437
I know a fellow in Odessa once
who could hold his breath...


261
00:29:15.514 --> 00:29:19.075
for five minutes, 33 seconds.

262
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.216
Did Mikhail talk to anyone
while he was here?


263
00:29:26.291 --> 00:29:29.692
Nicholas, please.
The man is trying to speak.


264
00:29:43.475 --> 00:29:47.377
He was talking...

265
00:29:47.445 --> 00:29:50.175
to her.

266
00:29:56.657 --> 00:29:59.751
So, what did you and Mikhail
talk about?


267
00:30:00.694 --> 00:30:02.628
I told him he had a phone call.

268
00:30:04.531 --> 00:30:06.624
The caviar is fresh tonight.

269
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.601
Did I tell you
what a pretty girl you are?


270
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.465
Let me ask you something, sweetheart.

271
00:30:14.542 --> 00:30:18.774
Do you have any idea what
will happen to you if you lie to me?


272
00:30:19.847 --> 00:30:21.781
I will never lie to you.

273
00:30:21.849 --> 00:30:25.148
Because if you lie to me,
pretty girl...


274
00:30:26.387 --> 00:30:29.845
you won't be pretty anymore.

275
00:30:35.698 --> 00:30:37.632
Get back to work.

276
00:30:43.239 --> 00:30:46.231
All she needs is a good f...

277
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:09.157
What are you doing over there?

278
00:31:13.837 --> 00:31:15.771
Oh, Mikhail, I missed you.

279
00:31:23.814 --> 00:31:26.612
You're so tense.

280
00:31:26.683 --> 00:31:29.049
I'll help loosen you up.

281
00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:37.519
What's this?

282
00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:41.394
You playing hard to get?

283
00:31:45.804 --> 00:31:47.465
Is this a game?

284
00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:52.835
Fine. Have it your way.

285
00:31:53.512 --> 00:31:55.639
But no handcuffs this time.

286
00:32:05.357 --> 00:32:07.791
You've gotten a lot harder
since you've been away.


287
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.380
Ivan was all over me
after you left tonight.


288
00:32:21.457 --> 00:32:24.153
He kept asking me stuff.

289
00:32:24.227 --> 00:32:28.027
Did I talk to you?
What did I say?


290
00:32:28.998 --> 00:32:31.694
He's like something
that crawls out of an old pipe.


291
00:32:32.353 --> 00:32:33.911
It's okay.

292
00:32:35.622 --> 00:32:39.524
In a few days,
this will all be behind us.


293
00:32:46.967 --> 00:32:50.767
Uh, I can't do it.

294
00:32:52.873 --> 00:32:56.741
I'm not Mikhail.
He's dead.


295
00:33:09.123 --> 00:33:10.954
Come here.

296
00:33:22.074 --> 00:33:23.371
Shit!

297
00:33:31.417 --> 00:33:34.875
Look, I'm positive the girl
went up to 323.


298
00:33:34.954 --> 00:33:37.218
The room is empty.
I was just up there.


299
00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.690
You saw her come in.
When did she leave?


300
00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:41.750
I don't...

301
00:33:44.463 --> 00:33:46.954
Do you recognize this man?

302
00:33:48.801 --> 00:33:50.826
Yeah. He checked in across the hall.

303
00:33:50.903 --> 00:33:55.340
- Room 305.
- Room 305. Okay, good. Let's go.


304
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.237
Found this.

305
00:34:12.313 --> 00:34:14.611
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.


306
00:34:14.682 --> 00:34:16.240
Where did he go?

307
00:34:17.218 --> 00:34:18.742
Tell me!

308
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.134
I want them dead!

309
00:34:39.258 --> 00:34:40.885
Down!

310
00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.579
Come on!

311
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.915
Hold it!

312
00:35:42.757 --> 00:35:44.816
What are you...

313
00:36:22.065 --> 00:36:24.659
Get in, get in, get in!

314
00:36:32.575 --> 00:36:33.667
Go!

315
00:37:23.729 --> 00:37:25.287
Keep moving.

316
00:37:27.133 --> 00:37:28.566
Come on.

317
00:37:37.009 --> 00:37:40.308
What's wrong?
Are you okay?


318
00:38:01.869 --> 00:38:04.360
You were supposed to go home
and write.


319
00:38:06.207 --> 00:38:09.040
Who needs home?
I'm always working anyway.


320
00:38:11.412 --> 00:38:14.870
I guess we got
chapter one finished, huh?


321
00:38:17.084 --> 00:38:18.745
Oh, my God!

322
00:38:19.487 --> 00:38:23.514
- Is this Alex? Alex Bohemia?
- Yeah.


323
00:38:24.325 --> 00:38:26.190
That's great.

324
00:38:26.261 --> 00:38:28.320
Unexpected development.

325
00:38:29.397 --> 00:38:31.865
The whole thing's so scary.

326
00:38:42.627 --> 00:38:44.925
We gotta go! Come on.

327
00:38:55.108 --> 00:38:56.541
Come on!

328
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.485
Zanzibar Club. Police state that
a man and woman were being pursued...


329
00:39:12.997 --> 00:39:14.965
He was in trouble.

330
00:39:16.434 --> 00:39:19.028
Wouldn't admit it, though.

331
00:39:19.103 --> 00:39:22.004
Always said he had everything
under control.


332
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.489
That he had a
lot of money put away.

333
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.434
Enough for a lifetime.

334
00:39:30.004 --> 00:39:32.370
Said he had a plan
that would get him out of the mob.


335
00:39:33.974 --> 00:39:37.341
I guess he was wrong.

336
00:39:37.411 --> 00:39:39.345
They found him.

337
00:39:41.082 --> 00:39:43.175
What did my brother mean to you?

338
00:39:48.522 --> 00:39:50.012
Everything.

339
00:39:50.292 --> 00:39:53.955
Take me to his place.
I want to get to know him.


340
00:39:54.029 --> 00:39:58.466
Take you to his place?
Are you crazy?


341
00:39:58.533 --> 00:40:01.001
You show up and start this mess
that almost gets us killed.


342
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:03.970
You don't have a clue
who you're dealing with, do you?


343
00:40:04.139 --> 00:40:06.335
If you wanna kill yourself,
be my guest.


344
00:40:06.408 --> 00:40:08.672
But who gave you the right
to risk my life?


345
00:40:08.744 --> 00:40:11.679
I can't go home.
I can't go to work.


346
00:40:11.747 --> 00:40:15.114
You painted a big red target
on my back.


347
00:40:15.385 --> 00:40:17.148
Where's the check?

348
00:40:43.513 --> 00:40:47.415
Mikhail used to say we could never stay
in one place too long.


349
00:40:47.484 --> 00:40:51.887
We have to move all the time.
It's time for us to move.


350
00:40:52.023 --> 00:40:55.982
- They'll find us here.
- The cabbie didn't have to die.


351
00:41:00.031 --> 00:41:04.092
This is just the beginning.
I've seen it before.


352
00:41:04.903 --> 00:41:07.929
They won't stop until you're dead, too.

353
00:41:16.414 --> 00:41:18.905
You can't go to the police.
You can't hide.


354
00:41:18.983 --> 00:41:21.747
Ivan and his boss, Kirov,
are relentless.


355
00:41:24.123 --> 00:41:27.092
All right, I'll bring you
to your brother's home.


356
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:49.112
This explains why Mikhail
picked a bank in Nice.


357
00:41:49.181 --> 00:41:51.274
Holy shit.

358
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.477
Looks like we got another chance.

359
00:41:53.552 --> 00:41:56.851
How did he manage to hide
a twin brother from us?


360
00:41:56.922 --> 00:42:01.325
Sir, Mikhail never communicated
with him. If he had, we'd have known.


361
00:42:01.662 --> 00:42:03.095
All right.

362
00:42:03.163 --> 00:42:07.156
Well, in less than 56 hours that bank
in Nice opens the safe deposit box...


363
00:42:07.234 --> 00:42:09.794
and we all read about ourselves
in the "New York Times."


364
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.930
If that happens...

365
00:42:13.006 --> 00:42:16.134
we'll be spending the rest of our lives
wondering how we screwed up so badly.


366
00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.940
Washington doesn't
like federal agents...


367
00:42:19.012 --> 00:42:21.276
working for the Russian mob.

368
00:42:21.348 --> 00:42:23.646
Our names are on that list.

369
00:42:26.887 --> 00:42:31.324
Get the brother.
Convince him to work with us in Nice.


370
00:42:31.391 --> 00:42:33.916
We don't have any options.

371
00:42:33.962 --> 00:42:35.420
We'll get him.

372
00:42:36.898 --> 00:42:42.530
And, guys, keep this one alive.
I doubt if they were triplets.


373
00:42:45.774 --> 00:42:47.571
Triplets.

374
00:43:06.846 --> 00:43:09.007
Alex, what are you doing?

375
00:44:07.281 --> 00:44:08.714
Look at this mess.

376
00:44:55.065 --> 00:44:57.829
Maybe if you told me what you're
looking for, I could help you find it.


377
00:44:59.102 --> 00:45:01.468
I wouldn't know what to tell you.
I'm just looking.


378
00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.609
What'd you find?

379
00:45:12.616 --> 00:45:14.049
He knew about me.

380
00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:22.119
What'd you do in the war?

381
00:45:22.193 --> 00:45:23.660
Sniper.

382
00:45:34.673 --> 00:45:37.107
Why wait five years to find me?

383
00:45:39.411 --> 00:45:42.574
Jimmy! You in there?

384
00:45:43.715 --> 00:45:47.674
Open up, you shithead!
This stuff's hot!


385
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.745
This is not your lucky day.

386
00:46:08.625 --> 00:46:11.617
Tell your boss to leave me
the fuck alone!


387
00:47:11.958 --> 00:47:15.917
Ivan, you look like your parrot died.

388
00:47:21.367 --> 00:47:25.463
- Mikhail's back.
- Bring him to me.


389
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:33.704
How can I bring him in when
I've got my hands tied behind my back?


390
00:47:35.848 --> 00:47:38.544
Let me deal with him my own way.

391
00:47:38.618 --> 00:47:42.748
This is not a democracy.
You do what I say. You understand?


392
00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.886
Mikhail has caused no trouble.

393
00:47:48.963 --> 00:47:51.295
If FBI had list, believe me...

394
00:47:51.365 --> 00:47:54.493
we'd have major war with Italians,
with everyone.


395
00:47:54.568 --> 00:47:59.232
If he is here,
then list is still in France.


396
00:47:59.306 --> 00:48:03.140
I will convince Mikhail
to take proper course of action.


397
00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:05.678
So, bring him to me.

398
00:48:06.514 --> 00:48:09.278
I meant no disrespect.
I'm just worried.


399
00:48:09.718 --> 00:48:13.882
Remember when you told me about Goradini
talking to the FBI?


400
00:48:13.955 --> 00:48:16.719
And Pietro? And Andrea?

401
00:48:16.791 --> 00:48:20.727
I took care of them for you, Dimitri.

402
00:48:20.795 --> 00:48:23.263
But Mikhail is different.

403
00:48:23.331 --> 00:48:26.095
I know you feel like he's your son.

404
00:48:32.373 --> 00:48:35.137
Yes, Dimitri.

405
00:48:36.145 --> 00:48:39.012
- Is this also Mikhail's place?
- No, my friend's.


406
00:48:39.081 --> 00:48:42.414
Mikhail and I used to come here
to escape.


407
00:48:43.619 --> 00:48:47.077
You looked comfortable with that gun
stuck in that guy's neck today.


408
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:51.426
That didn't scare me as much as when
you tried to drown him in the Jacuzzi.


409
00:48:53.831 --> 00:48:55.264
I lost it.

410
00:48:55.332 --> 00:48:57.129
Sorry.

411
00:48:57.201 --> 00:49:00.534
How long you been working
at the Bohemia?


412
00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.162
About a year.

413
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.038
I used to dance.
Nightclubs.


414
00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:10.203
I make less money now,
but it's a little more respectable.


415
00:49:20.475 --> 00:49:22.534
I doubt you'll find anything here
of your brother's.


416
00:49:25.981 --> 00:49:27.915
It's worth trying.

417
00:49:30.919 --> 00:49:33.217
What'd he do to make all these people
want to kill him?


418
00:49:38.627 --> 00:49:43.189
Mikhail talked about an insurance policy
or something that would keep him alive.


419
00:49:43.366 --> 00:49:45.960
The FBI was following him.

420
00:49:46.035 --> 00:49:48.503
Pressuring him
to turn evidence on Kirov.


421
00:49:50.339 --> 00:49:52.933
You think those aren't enough reasons
to kill him?


422
00:50:08.595 --> 00:50:11.029
The only time
my brother and I connected...


423
00:50:12.699 --> 00:50:15.463
was when he died.

424
00:50:18.405 --> 00:50:21.465
We both lost something.

425
00:50:35.388 --> 00:50:37.982
Rise and shine, boys and girls.

426
00:50:40.795 --> 00:50:43.355
Special Agent Pellman, Loomis.

427
00:50:43.431 --> 00:50:44.864
FBI.

428
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.290
How are you?

429
00:50:48.136 --> 00:50:51.970
Alex Bartlett.
Alain Moreau.


430
00:50:52.039 --> 00:50:54.769
I believe we share mutual concerns.

431
00:50:55.943 --> 00:51:00.073
We know you're not Mikhail. We know
you're not part of the Russian mob.


432
00:51:00.415 --> 00:51:03.748
That's a first.
What do you want?


433
00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.611
We want to nail the guys
that are trying to kill you.


434
00:51:08.357 --> 00:51:11.185
- And?
- Well, Mikhail kept a list.


435
00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.426
A detailed list...

436
00:51:13.496 --> 00:51:15.896
of people, places, events...

437
00:51:15.965 --> 00:51:19.401
which pretty much outlines
the entire Russian mob operation.


438
00:51:19.468 --> 00:51:22.232
Mikhail was working with us.

439
00:51:22.305 --> 00:51:24.865
He was helping us with
our investigation of the Russian mob.


440
00:51:26.542 --> 00:51:28.032
The fact is...

441
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:31.204
your brother wanted to set things right,
wanted to set things straight.


442
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.340
He wanted to help us.
He was gonna give us the list...


443
00:51:34.384 --> 00:51:35.875
before he was killed.

444
00:51:37.488 --> 00:51:39.786
The list is in a safe deposit box
in a bank in Nice.


445
00:51:39.857 --> 00:51:42.325
What we want you to do
is come with us to the bank...


446
00:51:42.393 --> 00:51:45.226
to Nice, and pretend...

447
00:51:45.296 --> 00:51:48.356
- I'm Mikhail.
- Exactly.


448
00:51:48.432 --> 00:51:51.629
Exactly.
We knew you'd want to help.


449
00:52:08.553 --> 00:52:10.544
But I don't.

450
00:52:11.289 --> 00:52:13.280
Can you protect her from being killed?

451
00:52:13.358 --> 00:52:17.624
Can you protect me?
You sure didn't protect my brother.


452
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:20.063
Hey, pal...

453
00:52:20.131 --> 00:52:22.429
we're your only hope.

454
00:52:22.502 --> 00:52:25.396
I'll take my chances.

455
00:52:27.123 --> 00:52:29.523
Why don't we try another approach, okay?

456
00:52:59.622 --> 00:53:01.055
Move.

457
00:53:15.856 --> 00:53:19.087
I don't understand. They're the FBI.
They're supposed to help us.


458
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.958
At gunpoint, it's not called help.

459
00:53:22.763 --> 00:53:26.392
God, nothing makes sense. Who isn't
trying to kill us at this point?


460
00:53:26.467 --> 00:53:29.800
When the FBI told you Mikhail
was working with them...


461
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:31.004
you didn't believe them, did you?

462
00:53:31.272 --> 00:53:34.332
No way. He would've told me.
I know he would've.


463
00:53:34.409 --> 00:53:37.901
So they lie!
They knew my brother was dead.


464
00:53:37.979 --> 00:53:42.245
The Russians didn't know about it.
The Russians were pissed at me...


465
00:53:42.317 --> 00:53:45.377
but not surprised to see me alive.

466
00:53:45.453 --> 00:53:50.652
- So if the Russians didn't kill him...
- Follow the list. Who else cares?


467
00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.660
The FBI.

468
00:53:53.729 --> 00:53:55.162
The FBI. Yeah.

469
00:54:01.637 --> 00:54:04.629
- Where are you going?
- To see Kirov.


470
00:54:04.707 --> 00:54:06.675
You can't leave me here.
I'm coming with you.


471
00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.839
It's too dangerous.

472
00:54:13.616 --> 00:54:17.518
I can't believe this is happening again.
First Mikhail and now you?


473
00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:21.046
Alain, you've got
to let me come with you.


474
00:54:21.124 --> 00:54:23.854
We're in this together, right?

475
00:54:26.063 --> 00:54:27.655
Alex...

476
00:54:27.732 --> 00:54:31.725
I promise you I'll come back for you.

477
00:54:34.705 --> 00:54:36.798
I promise.

478
00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:54.065
Take me to Kirov.

479
00:54:54.143 --> 00:54:55.576
Now.

480
00:55:14.463 --> 00:55:16.158
Sit down.

481
00:55:19.702 --> 00:55:21.795
Kirov asked me to bring him in.

482
00:55:36.853 --> 00:55:38.445
I'm so sorry, Kirov!

483
00:55:43.661 --> 00:55:45.788
Don't do it.

484
00:55:45.863 --> 00:55:47.296
Back off.

485
00:55:53.471 --> 00:55:55.871
I came to talk...

486
00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.498
to Kirov.

487
00:55:59.143 --> 00:56:00.701
Mikhail?

488
00:56:02.179 --> 00:56:03.942
No, you're not Mikhail.

489
00:56:04.015 --> 00:56:06.745
- Who are you?
- I'm his brother.


490
00:56:06.817 --> 00:56:11.220
If you're brother,
where is Mikhail?


491
00:56:11.289 --> 00:56:13.018
He's dead.

492
00:56:20.765 --> 00:56:23.233
I see I got your attention.

493
00:56:23.468 --> 00:56:26.335
- How did he die?
- You tell me.


494
00:56:26.405 --> 00:56:30.501
I had nothing to do with his death.
And you don't need your gun.


495
00:56:30.525 --> 00:56:33.460
- You're safe here.
- Your people tried to kill me.


496
00:56:33.528 --> 00:56:36.122
- They thought I was Mikhail.
- Impossible!


497
00:56:36.198 --> 00:56:39.099
I wanted to speak to him,
not kill him!


498
00:56:39.167 --> 00:56:42.762
To speak?
In what language?


499
00:56:42.838 --> 00:56:46.205
They tried to kill me
and almost succeeded.


500
00:56:56.119 --> 00:56:58.053
- Dimitri...
- Get out.


501
00:56:58.989 --> 00:57:00.923
- I just want...
- Get out!


502
00:57:16.273 --> 00:57:17.706
Look after Ivan.

503
00:57:25.283 --> 00:57:26.716
Mikhail.

504
00:57:28.019 --> 00:57:30.214
I'm sorry.
What is your name?


505
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:34.055
Alain.

506
00:57:34.125 --> 00:57:37.561
Come.
We need to talk.


507
00:58:14.567 --> 00:58:16.592
Ivan and Mikhail...

508
00:58:17.504 --> 00:58:20.234
they were like sons to me.

509
00:58:35.356 --> 00:58:37.347
I need a favor.

510
00:58:39.761 --> 00:58:42.195
I want to go back to Nice.

511
00:58:43.331 --> 00:58:44.764
Back home.

512
00:58:58.446 --> 00:58:59.879
Yes.

513
00:59:01.016 --> 00:59:03.678
I can help you.

514
00:59:03.752 --> 00:59:06.812
Mikhail had list
in bank in Nice.


515
00:59:08.023 --> 00:59:11.925
Get it for me.
We help each other, hmm?


516
00:59:25.674 --> 00:59:28.973
Do it!
Call the police! Do it!


517
01:00:15.493 --> 01:00:16.926
Go.

518
01:00:21.766 --> 01:00:23.859
Call an ambulance.

519
01:01:51.389 --> 01:01:53.584
Watch it, buddy!

520
01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:30.129
The other side!
Get him!


521
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.565
- Don't move!
- Okay, Peter Pan.


522
01:03:32.568 --> 01:03:34.126
Spread 'em!

523
01:03:44.512 --> 01:03:46.571
Get in the car!

524
01:03:50.985 --> 01:03:52.953
Read him his rights.

525
01:04:23.452 --> 01:04:26.319
Did you know
I had a contract out on him?


526
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:30.183
If you weren't protecting him,
he would be dead in his cell right now.


527
01:04:30.258 --> 01:04:33.592
The problem with you, Ivan,
is that you don't think. You kill.


528
01:04:33.663 --> 01:04:36.927
- You're not Kirov.
- What did you say?


529
01:04:40.737 --> 01:04:43.934
We need him to get the list, Ivan.

530
01:04:44.006 --> 01:04:47.669
- Why would he get you the list?
- Because you're gonna help make sure...


531
01:04:47.744 --> 01:04:50.440
he understands what happens
if he's not a good boy in Nice.


532
01:04:50.513 --> 01:04:51.946
Right?

533
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:53.882
And after?

534
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:56.280
We have 24 yours left. Work with us
on this, and he's all yours.


535
01:04:56.352 --> 01:04:58.416
I don't care what you do with him.

536
01:04:58.589 --> 01:05:01.319
- Fine.
- Ivan, listen.


537
01:05:01.391 --> 01:05:03.723
We know you have an alibi
for Kirov's death.


538
01:05:03.794 --> 01:05:05.628
We also know
that you had him killed.


539
01:05:05.796 --> 01:05:08.492
So after this, let's start fresh.
No more trouble. Is that okay with you?


540
01:05:08.565 --> 01:05:12.592
Listen to me.
I'm running things now, my way.


541
01:05:12.669 --> 01:05:16.662
And that girl knows too much.
She's mine now.


542
01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:25.243
Step this way.

543
01:05:25.317 --> 01:05:27.376
You have visitors.

544
01:05:51.778 --> 01:05:55.778
So, I'm hoping a good night's sleep
is all you needed to see the light.


545
01:06:17.288 --> 01:06:19.153
You win.

546
01:06:37.808 --> 01:06:40.072
In a few hours, we go bankin'.

547
01:06:40.144 --> 01:06:42.374
So try and get some rest.

548
01:06:54.191 --> 01:06:56.216
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

549
01:06:56.293 --> 01:06:59.729
Don't worry about it. I checked it out.
Everything's copacetic.


550
01:07:13.079 --> 01:07:15.343
So what's the plan?

551
01:07:15.415 --> 01:07:17.576
We gotta get out of here.

552
01:07:19.386 --> 01:07:20.819
No plan.

553
01:07:21.988 --> 01:07:23.421
Nothing.

554
01:07:29.362 --> 01:07:31.592
Alain, about tomorrow.

555
01:07:31.665 --> 01:07:35.624
Tomorrow I really find out
who my brother was.


556
01:07:40.907 --> 01:07:43.539
They're not gonna let us go...

557
01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:45.874
even when they get the list.

558
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:12.193
Monsieur Suverov.

559
01:10:12.265 --> 01:10:13.698
Welcome again.

560
01:10:14.834 --> 01:10:17.530
If there's anything I can do for you,
do not hesitate to make a request.


561
01:10:17.604 --> 01:10:19.538
I think we'd like to go right in,
if that's okay.


562
01:10:19.606 --> 01:10:21.870
I'm sorry.
Only Monsieur Suverov.


563
01:10:21.941 --> 01:10:24.273
The vault is for customers only.

564
01:10:24.344 --> 01:10:28.838
- My colleague and I would like to dis...
- I'm sorry, sir. Bank policy.


565
01:10:28.915 --> 01:10:31.884
Please, Monsieur Suverov,
come with me.


566
01:10:41.913 --> 01:10:45.440
Please, make yourself comfortable
and stay as long as you desire.


567
01:10:50.655 --> 01:10:54.682
Unfortunately, we must go through
the identity protocol again.


568
01:10:54.759 --> 01:10:56.192
Yeah, okay.

569
01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.393
Please identify yourself.

570
01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:59.692
Mikhail Suverov.

571
01:10:59.764 --> 01:11:02.392
And the second name?

572
01:11:02.767 --> 01:11:03.826
Alain Moreau.

573
01:11:04.222 --> 01:11:07.157
- Your mother's Christian given name?
- Chantal Moreau.


574
01:11:08.694 --> 01:11:11.026
Clean and quiet.

575
01:11:17.954 --> 01:11:19.387
Here, monsieur.

576
01:11:21.457 --> 01:11:24.119
- Do you smoke?
- No, sir, I don't.


577
01:11:24.193 --> 01:11:26.957
- Can I get a cigarette?
- Of course, monsieur.


578
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:29.760
And some gum.

579
01:11:29.832 --> 01:11:31.925
- Certainly.
- Thank you.


580
01:12:03.017 --> 01:12:04.951
I need access to my security box.

581
01:12:05.019 --> 01:12:07.317
May I see your I.D?

582
01:12:08.489 --> 01:12:11.981
This is the one under the name
Alain Moreau.


583
01:12:44.477 --> 01:12:45.910
Monsieur.

584
01:12:50.567 --> 01:12:54.003
Only you could access this box.

585
01:12:54.071 --> 01:12:56.869
Therefore, one of two things
has happened.


586
01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:00.740
We are together again
as we should have been, a family.


587
01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:03.780
Or I'm dead,
and you shouldn't trust anyone.


588
01:13:05.315 --> 01:13:07.783
I know you are a great marksman.

589
01:13:07.851 --> 01:13:11.287
Therefore, I'm leaving you a gift.
Your favorite.


590
01:13:11.355 --> 01:13:14.620
One of the boxes contains evidence
against government agents...


591
01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:16.784
and the Russian mob.

592
01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.385
Hand it over to the American embassy.

593
01:13:23.918 --> 01:13:27.945
Alain, when I found out about you,
it was luck.


594
01:13:28.022 --> 01:13:29.819
A newspaper.

595
01:13:29.891 --> 01:13:34.385
The moment I saw the picture,
I knew I had a brother in this world.


596
01:13:34.422 --> 01:13:38.085
You, my brother, reminded me
that I had a chance...


597
01:13:38.159 --> 01:13:39.589
and I decided to quit the mob.

598
01:13:39.962 --> 01:13:45.298
I didn't contact you because everything
I touched in my world turned to poison.


599
01:13:45.367 --> 01:13:49.463
I've tried all these years
to leave my life behind, to reunite us.


600
01:13:50.806 --> 01:13:53.536
I'm sorry if that never happens.

601
01:13:53.609 --> 01:13:55.543
Please forgive me.

602
01:13:55.611 --> 01:13:57.636
I want you to tell our mother...

603
01:13:57.713 --> 01:14:00.409
that I don't blame her
for what she did.


604
01:14:00.482 --> 01:14:03.117
The life I've lived
has taught me this.


605
01:14:03.185 --> 01:14:06.212
I only hope that we are listening
to this tape together.


606
01:14:06.289 --> 01:14:09.554
The money is for you and our mother.

607
01:14:09.626 --> 01:14:13.255
You are my only friend.
God bless.


608
01:14:47.732 --> 01:14:51.133
Have everything in the small box
turned over to the American embassy.


609
01:14:52.403 --> 01:14:54.769
- You understand?
- Perfectly, sir.


610
01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.654
What's going on?

611
01:15:57.905 --> 01:15:59.839
Sit down.
Just sit down.


612
01:16:16.323 --> 01:16:17.847
Get the fuck out of here!

613
01:17:44.784 --> 01:17:47.014
- We're clearing the building.
- Can't leave without our guy.


614
01:17:47.086 --> 01:17:50.817
You can meet him outside. Everyone
is being cleared to the street.


615
01:17:53.393 --> 01:17:56.055
Don't shoot.
I'm a cop.


616
01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:58.359
We'll see about that.

617
01:18:02.035 --> 01:18:03.969
Let's go. Come on.

618
01:18:53.456 --> 01:18:54.946
Sorry, sir.

619
01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.893
Let's go.

620
01:19:16.479 --> 01:19:18.413
Put your hands
where we can see them...


621
01:19:18.481 --> 01:19:20.379
and step out of the van.

622
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:21.483
Slowly.

623
01:19:22.653 --> 01:19:25.053
Keep your hands
where we can see them...


624
01:19:25.122 --> 01:19:27.020
and step out of the van.

625
01:19:27.192 --> 01:19:29.126
Back it up!

626
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.273
Move!

627
01:20:20.078 --> 01:20:21.943
Get out!

628
01:20:25.468 --> 01:20:27.333
You move, you die.

629
01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:11.048
Sebastien!

630
01:21:29.101 --> 01:21:31.535
Come on. Come on!

631
01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:34.238
Come on. Move!

632
01:21:37.176 --> 01:21:38.609
Me first.

633
01:21:38.677 --> 01:21:40.269
Get me out!

634
01:21:56.797 --> 01:21:58.992
Take a number.

635
01:22:04.638 --> 01:22:06.435
Come on.

636
01:22:06.507 --> 01:22:09.670
Don't leave me.
Please.


637
01:22:10.477 --> 01:22:12.741
I beg you!

638
01:22:12.813 --> 01:22:15.008
Help me!

639
01:22:30.199 --> 01:22:33.293
- You okay?
- Yeah. Thank you.


640
01:22:39.175 --> 01:22:41.439
The two men,
they took the girl with them.


641
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:43.102
That way.

642
01:23:05.135 --> 01:23:06.768
Don't shoot.

643
01:23:06.836 --> 01:23:08.668
- Where'd they go?
- Down there.


644
01:23:35.034 --> 01:23:37.332
Need the car.

645
01:23:37.703 --> 01:23:39.295
Sorry.

646
01:23:49.581 --> 01:23:51.674
Here he comes.
Comin' up.


647
01:24:15.407 --> 01:24:18.535
- Look out! Look out!
- Shut up!


648
01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:34.134
Watch that!

649
01:25:01.644 --> 01:25:04.169
Try that again and you're dead.
You hear me?


650
01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:51.144
Come on.

651
01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:06.483
Come on.

652
01:27:09.895 --> 01:27:12.125
I want you to listen to me now.

653
01:27:12.197 --> 01:27:14.427
I know you don't have the list.

654
01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.162
But that doesn't matter now. See?

655
01:27:18.437 --> 01:27:20.029
'Cause I want the money.

656
01:27:21.707 --> 01:27:24.801
I know you have Mikhail's money,
and I want it.


657
01:27:25.677 --> 01:27:27.975
Why don't you give it to me?

658
01:27:28.046 --> 01:27:29.980
And you walk.

659
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:33.484
Do we have a deal?

660
01:27:36.588 --> 01:27:39.751
Do we have a deal?
I don't think you get it, pal!


661
01:27:39.825 --> 01:27:42.988
I will kill her.
You understand me?


662
01:29:05.482 --> 01:29:08.344
The Americans are ecstatic
over Mikhail's evidence.


663
01:29:08.619 --> 01:29:11.345
They've made dozens of arrests.

664
01:29:11.722 --> 01:29:14.420
And thanks to his money,
you can afford to eat here.


665
01:29:17.028 --> 01:29:18.586
Hello, Alain.

666
01:29:19.013 --> 01:29:21.208
Are you nervous,
Alex meeting your mother?


667
01:29:23.217 --> 01:29:24.775
I'm not nervous.

668
01:29:28.489 --> 01:29:29.922
Okay, I'm nervous.

669
01:29:32.543 --> 01:29:35.603
Well, it's too late now.

670
01:29:43.054 --> 01:29:44.988
Wish me luck, okay?

671
01:29:51.651 --> 01:29:53.585
Do you feel okay?

672
01:29:53.953 --> 01:29:57.514
Because it's no reason to be nervous.

673
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:59.717
I'm not nervous.

674
01:29:59.792 --> 01:30:01.225
Good.

675
01:30:04.463 --> 01:30:08.194
Let's take a walk.
It's nearby.


676
01:30:08.267 --> 01:30:10.827
It's relaxing.

677
01:30:12.037 --> 01:30:15.097
Okay, good. 'Cause I think one of us
needs to relax.


678
01:30:17.176 --> 01:30:19.940
Do you know what you will say?

679
01:30:20.313 --> 01:30:23.009
I'm not asking you to lie.

680
01:30:23.083 --> 01:30:25.142
I don't need to lie, Alain.

681
01:30:25.218 --> 01:30:27.516
I'll tell your mother the truth
about Mikhail.


682
01:30:28.889 --> 01:30:31.221
That he was...

683
01:30:31.291 --> 01:30:34.283
kind and generous.

684
01:30:35.228 --> 01:30:36.661
Honest.

685
01:30:41.268 --> 01:30:43.302
Just like his brother.

686
01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:47.506
Thank you.
