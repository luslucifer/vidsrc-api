Well, that's that then.

12
00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:54.794
Let's get a cab.
I can't face the walk.


13
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:00.884
situated on
the outskirts of the city


14
00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:03.094
on the first day
of a week long series


15
00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:05.096
of special reports from Iraq

16
00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:08.516
to mark the fifth anniversary
of the Allied invasion.


17
00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:11.853
Five years on we've commissioned
the most comprehensive survey


18
00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:14.481
of the Iraqi people
ever undertaken,


19
00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.191
and it seems like the nation

20
00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.110
is deeply pessimistic
about the future.


21
00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:22.614
The people are concerned
over the continued rise in violence


22
00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:25.033
and about the remaining
deep divides


23
00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:30.372
in their society.

24
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.957
Garvey's here.

25
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.795
Hey, big Bill!

26
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:39.673
Can't keep a good man down,
can they?


27
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:42.092
- Nice to see you, mate.
- Yeah, you too.


28
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.177
Karl, make us some tea,
will you?


29
00:01:44.386 --> 00:01:45.906
I've gotta get out
of this monkey suit.


30
00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:47.514
Eh, full acquittal though, yeah?

31
00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:49.974
- Get in! Come here.
- Thanks, man.


32
00:01:50.183 --> 00:01:52.743
I knew it was bollocks. They'd never
make that stick, would they?


33
00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:54.654
It's a fucking waste
of the taxpayers' money.


34
00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:57.357
Tell you what, it should be legalized
anyway, shouldn't it?


35
00:01:57.565 --> 00:01:59.325
- Yeah. Anyway, do you want some tea?
- Yeah.


36
00:01:59.484 --> 00:02:02.612
Maggie, would you make
Garvey some tea, please?


37
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:19.546
Oh!

38
00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:24.384
Jesus Christ, it's like
a fucking noose!


39
00:02:24.592 --> 00:02:26.845
Undo the knot.
Come here.


40
00:02:27.053 --> 00:02:30.181
- You're just tightening it.
- Fucking get it off me, man!


41
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.809
Calm down.
Just let us have a look.


42
00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:46.072
How long has
he been here, Maggie?


43
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:49.200
- He's had a sandwich.
- The disgusting fat locust.


44
00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.786
He's not fat.
He's got big bones, Bill.


45
00:02:51.995 --> 00:02:53.580
Well, he's peasant stock,
isn't he?


46
00:02:53.788 --> 00:02:58.168
Now, you know, it's all beer
and armchairs and TVs,


47
00:02:58.376 --> 00:03:00.879
and they're just a load of slobs.
It sickens me.


48
00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:03.923
His dad was a moron as well.

49
00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.468
Good to see a friendly face.

50
00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:08.596
I thought I'd pop in,
make sure you're all right.


51
00:03:08.762 --> 00:03:11.931
Tough four months
for you boys, I'd imagine.


52
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.184
I just thought I'd come
and put your mind at rest.


53
00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:17.395
Everything's running smoothly.

54
00:03:17.604 --> 00:03:19.397
I knew it was all in safe hands.

55
00:03:19.606 --> 00:03:22.025
Well, I'll pop
to the little boys' room.


56
00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:24.319
Hey, you've put on
a bit of weight there, Garv.


57
00:03:24.527 --> 00:03:25.342
I don't think so.

58
00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:27.763
I think you're getting
a little bit heavier.


59
00:03:27.947 --> 00:03:30.742
Yeah, I can see it on the sides...
like handles.


60
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.119
Right, thanks.

61
00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.668
Hello, Eric.

62
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.922
Thanks.

63
00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:47.425
- Boys.
- Eric.


64
00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:50.220
- They gave you cake for the way out, did they?
- Oh, yeah.


65
00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:52.472
- All right, Eric?
- Yeah, I'm all right. You?


66
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.920
- Yeah, not too bad now.
- Looks like a slab of concrete.


67
00:03:55.058 --> 00:03:57.060
Yeah. Ah, it's all right.

68
00:03:57.268 --> 00:03:59.668
A little bit stale. Taste's a bit
like petrol, but it's okay.


69
00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:03.066
Looks like a dog's crapped on it.
Look at it.


70
00:04:03.274 --> 00:04:05.068
I quite liked it.

71
00:04:05.276 --> 00:04:07.276
- I thought it was all right.
- Oh, it's all right.


72
00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:09.125
If you swill it down
with enough tea,


73
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.032
it'll be getting there,
you know.


74
00:04:11.241 --> 00:04:13.493
Well, don't break
your teeth on it.


75
00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:14.549
Where'd you get it?

76
00:04:14.574 --> 00:04:16.895
I got it from the shop
at the end of the road.


77
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.582
- Those Pakis are thieves, man.
- You shouldn't say that...


78
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:21.626
Pakis... anymore,
should you?


79
00:04:21.835 --> 00:04:25.296
- What's someone from Afghanistan?
- Uh, Afghani.


80
00:04:25.505 --> 00:04:27.632
- There you go.
- Yeah, that's true.


81
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:30.134
- Brain of Britain.
- Yeah.


82
00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:32.846
This needs
painting over, Maggie.


83
00:04:33.054 --> 00:04:36.349
Yeah, everything's a mess here.

84
00:04:36.558 --> 00:04:39.978
We can't be too conspicuous.
That's the golden rule.


85
00:04:41.896 --> 00:04:44.774
I wouldn't want a new house.
They've always got problems.


86
00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:48.194
You can't trust builders.

87
00:04:48.403 --> 00:04:51.948
This situation needs sorting out,
tidying up.


88
00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:55.910
Yeah. Like someone
close in, obviously.


89
00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:58.079
Yeah.

90
00:04:58.288 --> 00:05:00.081
Well, it's an informant
culture, isn't it?


91
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.084
- Listen, about that money...
- Don't worry about that now.


92
00:05:03.293 --> 00:05:06.004
- That's good of you, Garv.
- That's all right.


93
00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:08.673
- I'll sort it out next week.
- No sweat.


94
00:05:08.882 --> 00:05:11.082
- I'll bring it round to your house.
- Or down the club.


95
00:05:11.175 --> 00:05:14.929
- Yeah, okay. Thanks, man.
- It's only money, isn't it?


96
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.475
- Any beer about?
- Only what you brought, mate.


97
00:05:19.684 --> 00:05:21.644
I thought this was meant
to be a big party.


98
00:05:21.853 --> 00:05:24.814
Well, I'll pop down the offy.
Who wants what?


99
00:05:25.023 --> 00:05:29.777
Get us some whiskey,
some wine and some beer.


100
00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:31.529
And some matches or a lighter.

101
00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:33.740
- No, a lighter.
- All right.


102
00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:35.825
Okay.

103
00:05:38.328 --> 00:05:40.872
Oh, fuck's sake.

104
00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:47.545
Where's Garvey getting
the booze from?


105
00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:50.114
- Just the offy over the road.
- Valda's coming round.


106
00:05:50.298 --> 00:05:52.300
- Who's coming over?
- Valda's coming round.


107
00:05:52.508 --> 00:05:55.219
Ah. That's his new bird.

108
00:05:55.428 --> 00:05:58.014
- Is it?
- I've been going out with her for a year.


109
00:05:58.222 --> 00:06:00.475
He's not been going out
with her for a year at all.


110
00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:02.769
How long have you
actually known her?


111
00:06:02.977 --> 00:06:05.457
- I haven't seen her in about six months.
- He hasn't seen her.


112
00:06:05.563 --> 00:06:08.983
- How long did you go out for?
- About a year... 10 months.


113
00:06:09.192 --> 00:06:11.736
I thought I heard
she done one.


114
00:06:11.945 --> 00:06:14.155
She did, but she just rung up.
She's coming round.


115
00:06:14.364 --> 00:06:17.367
Maybe she's pregnant.

116
00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:20.244
Yeah, that's...

117
00:06:20.453 --> 00:06:22.747
that's extremely unlikely.

118
00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:24.749
I fast for January.

119
00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.670
No to poisons, no to drugs,
no food.


120
00:06:28.878 --> 00:06:30.421
I only allow myself tea.

121
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.465
- And whiskey.
- Fucking hell, Bill.


122
00:06:32.674 --> 00:06:36.886
- I feel like a teenage tantric Superman.
- Yeah, so do I.


123
00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:38.846
I'm a simple person.

124
00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:41.557
I like to reconnect
to the essentials.


125
00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:45.061
Go on.
Come on.


126
00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:47.188
Come on, Eric, you're strong,

127
00:06:47.397 --> 00:06:48.856
you big-boned bastard.

128
00:06:49.065 --> 00:06:50.817
This is like tempered steel.
Come on.


129
00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:52.610
You do it to me,
then I'll do it to you.


130
00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.737
- Come on!
- Bad-tempered steel.


131
00:06:54.946 --> 00:06:56.990
Come on, Eric,
I'll let you have a go.


132
00:06:57.198 --> 00:06:59.867
- Come on, then.
- Let's have it.


133
00:07:04.497 --> 00:07:06.297
- Looks like a crossover.
- Go on, take a dig.


134
00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:08.751
- Take a fucking dig, Eric!
- Feel that.


135
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.838
- It's soft as shite.
- Oh, you bastard!


136
00:07:12.046 --> 00:07:15.049
I forgot to pick the kids up.

137
00:07:15.258 --> 00:07:18.219
- Oh, a man out of time.
- Shit.


138
00:07:18.428 --> 00:07:20.228
What's happened?

139
00:07:20.388 --> 00:07:21.931
Oh, that's them outside now.

140
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.725
I'd better go.

141
00:07:26.185 --> 00:07:28.187
Who's out there?

142
00:07:28.396 --> 00:07:30.606
- It's his missus.
- Is she coming in?


143
00:07:30.815 --> 00:07:32.108
No no no.
I'd better go.


144
00:07:32.316 --> 00:07:33.796
I gotta feed the kids
and that, but...


145
00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:35.501
Is that Helen?
I ain't seen her in years.


146
00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:37.071
Yeah yeah.
We gotta go.


147
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.073
Well, uh, nice one.
Well done and everything.


148
00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:40.700
- Yeah, well done.
- Cheers, Garv.


149
00:07:40.908 --> 00:07:42.577
Yeah, see you later.

150
00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:44.454
See you, Maggie.

151
00:07:46.497 --> 00:07:48.041
See you, everyone.

152
00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:50.168
Cheers, Garv.
Have a good one, mate.


153
00:07:50.376 --> 00:07:52.003
She looks absolutely furious.

154
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:54.047
Give 'em a kiss
for me, Garv.


155
00:07:54.255 --> 00:07:56.382
She's fit...
his missus, mate.


156
00:07:56.591 --> 00:08:00.094
- Hoo-hoo.
- That's his old missus.


157
00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:03.222
His new missus is like
a hippo-croco-pig.


158
00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:10.480
- A bit shortsighted.
- Looks a bit like him in a lady mirror.


159
00:08:10.688 --> 00:08:15.234
A female version of Garvey.
Can you imagine it?


160
00:08:15.443 --> 00:08:17.563
Give us one of those beers.
Oh, these are from Garvey.


161
00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:20.156
- Good old Garvin, eh?
- Yeah, cheers.


162
00:08:20.364 --> 00:08:23.534
- What a little superstar.
- He's shaken 'em up, hasn't he?


163
00:08:23.743 --> 00:08:26.662
He's totally fucking
depth-charged me.


164
00:08:26.871 --> 00:08:30.416
Why don't you just pour it
over the carpet?


165
00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:33.836
Karl. Oi.

166
00:08:34.045 --> 00:08:36.605
- Yeah? Hello, mate.
- Come here, I've got something to show you.


167
00:08:36.798 --> 00:08:39.884
- Hold on a second.
- By the way, when are you coming back to work?


168
00:08:40.093 --> 00:08:41.933
Soon. Just got to be
a bit careful, that's all.


169
00:08:42.136 --> 00:08:43.554
Well, you need to hurry up.

170
00:08:43.763 --> 00:08:45.243
I'm running round
like a blue-ass fly.


171
00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:47.433
This thing don't
run itself, you know?


172
00:08:47.642 --> 00:08:49.682
- Everything's going all right though, yeah?
- Yeah.


173
00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:52.009
A bit of trouble in Whitehawk,
but otherwise shway shway.


174
00:08:52.188 --> 00:08:53.940
- Sweet.
- Come on out.


175
00:08:54.148 --> 00:08:56.859
I've got something to show you.

176
00:08:57.068 --> 00:08:59.112
You are coming back
to work, aren't you?


177
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.198
Yeah, I told you. 
I'm coming in.

178
00:09:02.406 --> 00:09:05.910
So I don't have to run this whole
bloody operation by myself.


179
00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:08.412
Get in there. I've got something
to show you.


180
00:09:08.621 --> 00:09:10.665
- They're not gonna come up, are they?
- Doubt it.


181
00:09:10.873 --> 00:09:15.086
Oh, fucking hell! It's gone right through
the lining on my jacket.


182
00:09:15.294 --> 00:09:17.964
- What's that, Eric?
- A fucking gun, mate.


183
00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:19.882
- Got it off Don the Gun.
- Fuck off.


184
00:09:20.091 --> 00:09:22.009
That looks totally real, man.

185
00:09:22.218 --> 00:09:26.097
It is fucking totally real.
What are you talking about?


186
00:09:26.305 --> 00:09:28.141
- You serious?
- It's a real gun, yeah.


187
00:09:28.349 --> 00:09:31.352
I just bought it for 200 quid.

188
00:09:33.187 --> 00:09:35.064
Are you serious?
This is a real shooter?


189
00:09:35.273 --> 00:09:36.993
Yeah, it's a real shooter.
I just bought it.


190
00:09:37.108 --> 00:09:39.944
I just told you.
I need it, don't I?


191
00:09:42.155 --> 00:09:44.448
- What, you never seen a fucking gun before?
- Eric, Eric,


192
00:09:44.657 --> 00:09:46.200
are you out of your
fucking mind, mate?


193
00:09:46.409 --> 00:09:47.952
What?

194
00:09:48.161 --> 00:09:51.164
- Put it away and take it home.
- All right, all right.


195
00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:53.291
Well, he's not going
to see it, is he?


196
00:09:53.499 --> 00:09:55.819
I've just got my... I've just got
my prints all over a gun.


197
00:09:55.918 --> 00:09:57.962
Oh, for fuck's sake.
What are you, paranoid or what?


198
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:00.256
What do you mean?
I've just come back from court.


199
00:10:00.464 --> 00:10:02.745
Oh, for Christ's sake, mate.

200
00:10:02.884 --> 00:10:05.303
- What's up with you?
- Has this been fired?


201
00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:07.722
Don't know.
Didn't ask.


202
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.557
Mate...

203
00:10:09.765 --> 00:10:11.684
Look, give it to me.
I'll do that.


204
00:10:11.893 --> 00:10:14.270
- Come on...
- No, I'll do it. Thanks very much, Eric.


205
00:10:15.938 --> 00:10:17.658
It don't mean the old Bill
are going to come


206
00:10:17.732 --> 00:10:19.734
straight round now, are they?

207
00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:25.531
Put it away.
I don't want to see it again.


208
00:10:28.534 --> 00:10:30.995
Was he always such
an unctuous little prick...


209
00:10:31.204 --> 00:10:33.039
fucking Garvey?

210
00:10:33.247 --> 00:10:35.750
I'll say he's pretty consistent.
Why?


211
00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.544
I can't believe the old man's left him
running that fucking club.


212
00:10:38.753 --> 00:10:40.254
He's making a fortune, man.

213
00:10:40.463 --> 00:10:42.383
I mean, he's just moved
into some flash new drum.


214
00:10:42.506 --> 00:10:44.592
Well, that should have
me and you on it.


215
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.719
What can you say?
Bill is Bill.


216
00:10:46.928 --> 00:10:49.805
- How's he holding up?
- A bit rattled, I'd say.


217
00:10:50.014 --> 00:10:52.016
- Minor.
- What about you?


218
00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:55.436
Fine. I'm just trying
not to think about it.


219
00:10:55.645 --> 00:10:57.245
You know I'm right
behind you, don't you?


220
00:10:57.396 --> 00:10:59.357
What, leading from the rear, yeah?

221
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.861
I've got your back, mate.

222
00:11:06.822 --> 00:11:08.658
Where's Garvey?

223
00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:13.287
If Benson had testified...

224
00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:17.333
It's all right, mate.
Calm down.


225
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:19.418
It's all sorted.

226
00:11:19.627 --> 00:11:21.712
There you go.

227
00:11:21.921 --> 00:11:24.257
Oh, hang on. Here.

228
00:11:24.465 --> 00:11:27.510
- All right. Thanks, Karl.
- How you holding up?


229
00:11:33.182 --> 00:11:36.811
Well, they've shown their hand now,
haven't they?


230
00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:38.813
Yeah, we're home and dry
now though, right?


231
00:11:39.021 --> 00:11:41.565
Are we?

232
00:11:41.774 --> 00:11:44.318
I feel like I've been fighting this corner
forever, mate.


233
00:11:46.612 --> 00:11:48.572
40 years...
not a bad run.


234
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.369
Oh, it was a run, was it?

235
00:11:53.577 --> 00:11:55.663
I mean, I was a smoker.

236
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:59.583
I mean, I was a...
I was an artist, a poet.


237
00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:02.962
- The head.
- I was a head, you know.


238
00:12:04.338 --> 00:12:05.965
And I said I would do it.

239
00:12:06.173 --> 00:12:07.591
I started doing it

240
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.886
and I could have
as much gear as I wanted,


241
00:12:11.095 --> 00:12:12.471
which was all
I was interested in.


242
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.473
The funny thing was...
this is what I noticed


243
00:12:14.682 --> 00:12:16.726
first of all
when I got into it...


244
00:12:16.934 --> 00:12:21.397
was everybody else was into
making money, except me.


245
00:12:21.605 --> 00:12:24.191
I mean, me and Timothy Leary,
you know.


246
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.945
I believed that this was a revolution
of consciousness


247
00:12:28.154 --> 00:12:30.823
and there was gonna be
an evolution taking place.


248
00:12:31.032 --> 00:12:33.284
And we were gonna find out
all these discoveries


249
00:12:33.492 --> 00:12:36.245
about the brain and the future

250
00:12:36.454 --> 00:12:38.998
and how to be high and stay high

251
00:12:39.206 --> 00:12:43.669
and how to be magical, how to live
in the world in this sort of new way.


252
00:12:43.878 --> 00:12:46.130
But all these other characters
basically were into bread.


253
00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:49.467
They made money and I
ended up just becoming


254
00:12:49.675 --> 00:12:52.011
just another criminal like them
because of force majeure.


255
00:12:52.219 --> 00:12:54.179
Because of Maggie and then
you and the rest of it,


256
00:12:54.305 --> 00:12:56.057
I had to do something.

257
00:12:56.265 --> 00:12:57.308
You know?

258
00:12:57.516 --> 00:12:59.852
Studied the "Tibetan
Book of the Dead."


259
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:02.813
I learned how to control
my consciousness when I got into acid.


260
00:13:03.022 --> 00:13:04.231
I knew how to sort of...

261
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.317
I did the full lotus,

262
00:13:06.525 --> 00:13:09.111
where you can get into
that little pyramid shape.


263
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.240
And then it all starts to unfold,
you know, and curl up.


264
00:13:13.449 --> 00:13:16.744
It goes out the top of your head
and there you are, man.


265
00:13:16.952 --> 00:13:19.080
And you're like, "Hey, I'm God.

266
00:13:19.288 --> 00:13:21.874
I am all men.
I can be Everyman.


267
00:13:22.083 --> 00:13:24.960
I'm no better, no worse...

268
00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:27.296
certainly no worse than anyone else
in the world.


269
00:13:27.505 --> 00:13:30.132
I am Man.
I am Adam Kadmon."


270
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:33.969
Three things... that's what I found
at the top level.


271
00:13:34.178 --> 00:13:36.013
You know what?
It's a triangle.


272
00:13:36.222 --> 00:13:39.183
It's goodness, truth and beauty.

273
00:13:39.392 --> 00:13:41.727
And if things aren't good,

274
00:13:41.936 --> 00:13:43.813
they're not true
and they're not beautiful.


275
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:46.440
If it's good, it's also true
and beautiful.


276
00:13:46.649 --> 00:13:48.067
And that was the aim...

277
00:13:48.275 --> 00:13:52.863
to get that little triangle
in your forehead


278
00:13:53.072 --> 00:13:56.367
so you could see through
that lens of goodness, truth and beauty,


279
00:13:56.575 --> 00:13:59.745
and see the goodness and see
the truth and see the beauty.


280
00:13:59.954 --> 00:14:02.289
I've just become some sort of,
you know, grim recluse


281
00:14:02.498 --> 00:14:03.916
living in my diamond cave.

282
00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:07.503
There were good drugs
to start with,


283
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:09.130
and then the freak-out
of the laws


284
00:14:09.338 --> 00:14:10.756
and the paranoia began.

285
00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:12.425
And everybody splintered off

286
00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:14.760
and went into their rooms
and closed their curtains.


287
00:14:14.969 --> 00:14:18.055
And the communities
were all closed off from one another


288
00:14:18.264 --> 00:14:19.974
so nobody knew
what anybody else was doing.


289
00:14:20.182 --> 00:14:21.559
Everybody else
was just paranoid.


290
00:14:21.767 --> 00:14:25.521
You're only as good
as the people you're with.


291
00:14:27.022 --> 00:14:29.108
Yeah, I know.

292
00:14:30.943 --> 00:14:33.154
Okay, lads,

293
00:14:33.362 --> 00:14:35.573
double bubbles all round.

294
00:14:35.781 --> 00:14:38.033
Yeah.

295
00:15:06.687 --> 00:15:09.273
What are we gonna do then, Bill?

296
00:15:09.482 --> 00:15:12.276
Well, we're gonna find out
who's behind all this.


297
00:15:20.534 --> 00:15:24.288
♪ She is the little
queen of spades ♪


298
00:15:24.497 --> 00:15:27.666
♪ And the men will not
let her be ♪


299
00:15:31.545 --> 00:15:35.049
♪ Hmm, she's the little
queen of spades ♪


300
00:15:35.257 --> 00:15:38.385
♪ And the men will not
let her be ♪


301
00:15:42.515 --> 00:15:44.850
♪ Every time she makes
a spread ♪


302
00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:49.605
♪ Hoo, fair brown, cold chill
just runs all over me. ♪


303
00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:58.739
- Oh, all right. How you doing?
- All right, Bill?


304
00:15:58.948 --> 00:16:00.783
Good result, eh?

305
00:16:00.991 --> 00:16:02.743
What's the point of you
being on the inside


306
00:16:02.952 --> 00:16:04.703
when you don't
help us out, Dave?


307
00:16:04.912 --> 00:16:07.581
I'm only a counselor, Bill.

308
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.459
Look, I done all I could.

309
00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:12.586
You've been
well lucky this time.


310
00:16:12.795 --> 00:16:15.172
Have we?
It doesn't feel like we have.


311
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:18.926
So have you any idea
where all this has come from?


312
00:16:19.134 --> 00:16:21.345
Nobody specific.

313
00:16:21.554 --> 00:16:23.556
But it's someone close in.

314
00:16:23.764 --> 00:16:25.391
You don't get paid
to speculate, David.


315
00:16:25.599 --> 00:16:26.892
You get paid for intelligence.

316
00:16:27.101 --> 00:16:29.186
The police have got
this document.


317
00:16:29.395 --> 00:16:33.232
I've told you, it's like a family tree
with it all mapped out.


318
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.526
And it's well
comprehensive, Bill.


319
00:16:35.734 --> 00:16:37.653
All kinds of people
are on it, mate.


320
00:16:37.861 --> 00:16:40.406
It goes right back
to your grandfather.


321
00:16:40.614 --> 00:16:42.783
It's basically
the complete fucking picture.


322
00:16:42.992 --> 00:16:44.118
I doubt that.

323
00:16:44.326 --> 00:16:47.663
The Barneses, the Cowells,

324
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:49.748
the Pikes...
they're all on it, mate.


325
00:16:49.957 --> 00:16:51.584
All their marriages
back and forth.


326
00:16:51.792 --> 00:16:53.127
Well, that's all
public knowledge.


327
00:16:53.335 --> 00:16:54.628
So? What can they prove?

328
00:16:54.837 --> 00:16:57.298
They don't have to
prove anything, do they?


329
00:16:57.506 --> 00:16:59.508
Listen to me, Bill.

330
00:16:59.717 --> 00:17:01.510
They've just got to look at you

331
00:17:01.719 --> 00:17:03.304
and eventually
something happens.


332
00:17:03.512 --> 00:17:04.888
They know it'll balance out.

333
00:17:05.097 --> 00:17:07.850
Well, maybe they need
balancing out.


334
00:17:09.435 --> 00:17:11.103
In the next life, yeah.

335
00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:49.016
Oh, lovely.

336
00:17:53.604 --> 00:17:55.606
Fuck!

337
00:18:04.156 --> 00:18:06.450
- Give me a minute, that's all.
- Okay.


338
00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:10.412
My God.

339
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:12.247
You've put on a bit of weight,
ain't you?


340
00:18:12.456 --> 00:18:14.208
For God's sake, 
Bill, she's...

341
00:18:14.416 --> 00:18:16.210
- You're gonna be a granddad, Bill.
- What?!


342
00:18:16.418 --> 00:18:19.380
I've heard of sudden death,
but sudden birth?


343
00:18:19.588 --> 00:18:22.466
Where's all this
come from, Karl?


344
00:18:22.675 --> 00:18:24.677
Just...

345
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.609
When were you gonna tell me?

346
00:18:40.818 --> 00:18:42.611
I'm telling you now.

347
00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.697
My dad's downstairs.
My mom is downstairs.


348
00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:47.199
He's fucking loving it.

349
00:18:47.408 --> 00:18:50.494
I'm never... I'm never gonna
hear the end of this. This is...


350
00:18:50.703 --> 00:18:53.317
I don't think your dad is
the biggest problem here.


351
00:18:53.342 --> 00:18:54.397
Oh, come off it.

352
00:18:56.834 --> 00:18:58.836
Just give me a second.

353
00:19:01.547 --> 00:19:03.799
This is quite a number.
This...


354
00:19:12.307 --> 00:19:15.018
I must be going
through a bad phase.


355
00:19:18.105 --> 00:19:19.982
Maybe a baby's the thing
to pull me out of it.


356
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.110
I don't know.
Who fucking knows?


357
00:19:25.195 --> 00:19:28.532
Or this kid's gonna make it...

358
00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:30.534
this kid's gonna make it worse.

359
00:19:30.743 --> 00:19:33.746
How does he know this one?
I get confused.


360
00:19:33.954 --> 00:19:37.166
They was pen pals last
time he was in prison.

361
00:19:37.374 --> 00:19:39.501
How do you go to prison
for assault


362
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.503
when you're the one
that's assaulted?


363
00:19:41.712 --> 00:19:43.672
Well, you know,

364
00:19:43.881 --> 00:19:46.550
it was that
unreasonable force thing.


365
00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:49.261
That other lad's
still not right.


366
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.848
- He's not ready.
- What's that, Granddad?


367
00:19:53.056 --> 00:19:55.225
Granddad to a bastard.

368
00:19:55.434 --> 00:19:58.312
- Is there a word for that?
- Cunt.


369
00:20:14.328 --> 00:20:16.914
Those letters you wrote me in prison
were really nice.


370
00:20:17.122 --> 00:20:19.750
Good.

371
00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:21.585
I've got some...

372
00:20:21.794 --> 00:20:23.587
I've got some just here.

373
00:20:23.796 --> 00:20:26.673
- You can do a live reading.
- Okay.


374
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.601
They were just here.

375
00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.020
- Doesn't matter.
- Fuck.


376
00:20:41.355 --> 00:20:43.482
They were just fucking here.

377
00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.026
- It's okay. It doesn't matter.
- It's... it's not okay.


378
00:20:46.235 --> 00:20:48.237
Somebody's moved them.

379
00:20:50.155 --> 00:20:52.157
Where the fuck are they?

380
00:20:52.366 --> 00:20:54.827
They were just fucking here.

381
00:20:57.079 --> 00:20:59.122
Oh, for fuck's sake!

382
00:20:59.331 --> 00:21:02.543
- Fuck!
- There's some letters down here.


383
00:21:02.751 --> 00:21:03.829
They might be down here.

384
00:21:03.854 --> 00:21:06.279
They're not down... they
were fucking here, man!


385
00:21:06.463 --> 00:21:09.174
- It's okay.
- It's not okay, it's fucked!


386
00:21:09.383 --> 00:21:13.595
It's fucking typical.
It's fucking fucked right up.


387
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.352
Mom!

388
00:21:21.562 --> 00:21:23.564
Mom...

389
00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:33.699
Mom! Mom!

390
00:21:33.907 --> 00:21:36.243
Mom, have you seen
those letters?


391
00:21:36.451 --> 00:21:40.372
- Calm down. It's okay.
- It's not okay!


392
00:21:41.415 --> 00:21:43.417
Oh, there they are.

393
00:21:46.837 --> 00:21:49.214
I never knew you liked
reading so much.


394
00:21:49.423 --> 00:21:51.842
This is all just shit
we sell on eBay.


395
00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:53.844
Oh, I see.

396
00:21:54.052 --> 00:21:55.888
Do you like Hitler?

397
00:21:56.096 --> 00:21:58.974
A rare book about him here.

398
00:21:59.182 --> 00:22:02.603
That's Hitler's dog, Blondie,

399
00:22:02.811 --> 00:22:04.688
the Alsatian.

400
00:22:04.897 --> 00:22:06.899
Got poisoned.

401
00:22:08.609 --> 00:22:11.528
Not really his fault,
but there you go.


402
00:22:11.737 --> 00:22:13.947
That's war.

403
00:22:16.783 --> 00:22:19.036
- Oh, to you, son.
- Cheers, Dad.


404
00:22:19.244 --> 00:22:22.247
I was thinking it's gonna be really nice
out there when you paint that room.


405
00:22:22.456 --> 00:22:23.999
Yeah, it'll be lovely.
Come on, baby.


406
00:22:24.207 --> 00:22:25.487
And maybe while you're doing it,

407
00:22:25.626 --> 00:22:27.085
you could think about
doing in here.


408
00:22:27.294 --> 00:22:29.212
Yeah, no, absolutely.
Yeah, sure.


409
00:22:29.421 --> 00:22:31.381
- Would you like a whiskey, Valda?
- I'm pregnant.


410
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.091
Thanks anyway, Bill.

411
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.093
Oh well, I suppose
it's about time


412
00:22:35.302 --> 00:22:36.720
we did pair off, isn't it?

413
00:22:36.929 --> 00:22:38.764
- How old are you now?
- 27.


414
00:22:38.972 --> 00:22:43.018
- Ah. And how old are you now, Karl?
- 34.


415
00:22:43.226 --> 00:22:45.729
- Come on.
- Anyway, see you later.


416
00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:47.940
Yeah.

417
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.526
Bye, sweetie.

418
00:22:53.153 --> 00:22:55.364
So... bye.

419
00:22:56.365 --> 00:22:58.617
The trap slams shut.

420
00:23:00.494 --> 00:23:02.871
How do you know it's your kid?

421
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.498
Fucking hell, Dad.

422
00:23:04.706 --> 00:23:06.375
You don't wanna find
yourself bringing up


423
00:23:06.583 --> 00:23:08.585
some other bloke's bastard.

424
00:23:10.879 --> 00:23:12.589
Oh, f...

425
00:23:12.798 --> 00:23:14.800
It's so typical.

426
00:23:15.008 --> 00:23:17.761
Why do you have to be
so fucking negative?


427
00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.766
- You are my fucking son.
- No, fuck you!


428
00:23:22.975 --> 00:23:25.394
- You're lazy. You're a fucking bastard.
- Fuck you!


429
00:23:25.602 --> 00:23:28.202
You don't know who the fuck she is
or where she's come from.


430
00:23:28.355 --> 00:23:30.983
I went out with her for a year, Dad!
I know who she is.


431
00:23:31.191 --> 00:23:33.871
- What else might she be keeping from us?
- That's fucking bullshit.


432
00:23:33.902 --> 00:23:35.612
This is a critical period
at the moment.


433
00:23:35.821 --> 00:23:38.615
I won't let you fuck it up
with this baby bullshit.


434
00:23:38.824 --> 00:23:41.003
What the fuck has it got
to do with you anyway?


435
00:23:41.028 --> 00:23:42.435
Tell her to get rid of it.

436
00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:46.623
- Oh!
- Bill, it's too late for that.


437
00:23:46.832 --> 00:23:50.085

intuition about it?


447
00:24:28.623 --> 00:24:30.167
Well, you know,
I'm not really involved


448
00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:32.252
in that anymore...
sort of thing, Bill.


449
00:24:32.461 --> 00:24:34.141
I'm kept pretty busy
at the club, you know.


450
00:24:34.337 --> 00:24:36.506
I've got kids and that.

451
00:24:36.715 --> 00:24:40.177
And to be honest with you, I don't
feel as comfortable with it physically


452
00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:42.012
as when I was a bit younger.

453
00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.514
You're getting fat. You don't
need to make excuses, mate.


454
00:24:44.723 --> 00:24:48.185
- All right, yeah.
- You know?


455
00:24:48.393 --> 00:24:52.272
You and my dad used to be proper terrors,
didn't you, back in the day?


456
00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:55.150
Your dad was one
of my best mates.


457
00:24:55.358 --> 00:24:58.487
In fact, he was
my closest friend.


458
00:24:58.695 --> 00:25:00.947
Yeah. I mean, your dad was...
I would say your dad


459
00:25:01.156 --> 00:25:04.284
was the smartest
and the funniest man in town.


460
00:25:04.493 --> 00:25:05.869
He was the one to beat.

461
00:25:06.078 --> 00:25:08.705
- I miss him quite a lot.
- We all miss him.


462
00:25:08.914 --> 00:25:12.542
What happened to your old man
was... was terrible.


463
00:25:12.751 --> 00:25:14.086
I never got over it really.

464
00:25:14.294 --> 00:25:16.755
I'm still sick inside about that.

465
00:25:16.963 --> 00:25:19.216
You know I think he was murdered,
don't you?


466
00:25:19.424 --> 00:25:21.301
- Really?
- Yeah.


467
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:24.596
- I thought it was just a fire.
- Well, yeah.


468
00:25:24.805 --> 00:25:27.349
I sometimes think
I should avenge his death.


469
00:25:27.557 --> 00:25:29.197
That's what I'm supposed
to do as the son.


470
00:25:29.309 --> 00:25:33.063
But is that bad that
I just don't want to?


471
00:25:33.271 --> 00:25:35.023
Well, it's all
changed now, isn't it?


472
00:25:35.232 --> 00:25:37.442
There are no fathers left,
or hardly any fathers.


473
00:25:37.651 --> 00:25:41.238
All these fucking slags living off
the state like fucking parasites,


474
00:25:41.446 --> 00:25:43.365
leaving all the men
in fucking rooms.


475
00:25:43.573 --> 00:25:46.576
- So where are the fathers to avenge?
- Yeah.


476
00:25:46.785 --> 00:25:48.703
It's all gone, mate.
You know what I mean?


477
00:25:48.912 --> 00:25:52.749
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But still...


478
00:25:52.958 --> 00:25:55.085
- No, you're doing all right, you know?
- Yeah.


479
00:25:55.293 --> 00:25:58.004
I mean, you were lucky
because you had a dad


480
00:25:58.213 --> 00:25:59.965
that was, you know...
it was okay.


481
00:26:00.173 --> 00:26:01.550
I had him for a bit, yeah.

482
00:26:01.758 --> 00:26:04.136
I mean, my fucking old man...
he died in his bed


483
00:26:04.344 --> 00:26:06.930
and let me find him naked
and dead when I was 13.


484
00:26:07.139 --> 00:26:09.266
Bloody hell.
That's terrible, Bill.


485
00:26:09.474 --> 00:26:11.768
I'm still sick inside.

486
00:26:11.977 --> 00:26:13.937
Never got over that.

487
00:26:14.146 --> 00:26:15.689
- What a bastard.
- Yeah.


488
00:26:15.897 --> 00:26:18.066
That's what dads do...
they die.


489
00:26:18.275 --> 00:26:20.068
- You know?
- Yeah.


490
00:26:20.277 --> 00:26:24.197
Well, anyway, I'll keep my ear out
about what happened.


491
00:26:24.406 --> 00:26:25.846
Lots of people come
through the club.


492
00:26:25.991 --> 00:26:27.909
Someone might say something.

493
00:26:28.118 --> 00:26:29.786
Well, if you hear
anything, mate,


494
00:26:29.995 --> 00:26:31.663
just let Karl know...

495
00:26:31.872 --> 00:26:35.709
- Of course, yeah.
- and I'll hear it.


496
00:26:35.917 --> 00:26:38.503
- You're all right, son. You're all right.
- Cheers, Bill.


497
00:26:38.712 --> 00:26:40.714
- Cheers.
- Yeah, no worries.


498
00:26:46.469 --> 00:26:48.638
Cheers, Bill.

499
00:26:48.847 --> 00:26:50.473
- Cheers, mate.
- Thanks a lot.


500
00:26:50.682 --> 00:26:52.184
Cheers.

501
00:26:58.523 --> 00:27:01.234
Garvey.

502
00:27:01.443 --> 00:27:04.821
Garvey?
That's left of field.


503
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.990
I don't like him...
never did.


504
00:27:07.199 --> 00:27:10.410
He's too nice.
It's a weakness.


505
00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:12.621
Being nice is a weakness?

506
00:27:12.829 --> 00:27:14.748
Don't be sentimental.

507
00:27:14.956 --> 00:27:17.834
Who has the most to gain
by you going to prison?


508
00:27:18.043 --> 00:27:20.420
There's a lot of people
who would gain.


509
00:27:20.629 --> 00:27:22.631
I don't trust him.

510
00:27:22.839 --> 00:27:24.466
Didn't trust his father either,

511
00:27:24.674 --> 00:27:26.885
and we know how that turned out.

512
00:27:27.093 --> 00:27:28.887
Yeah, point taken.

513
00:27:29.095 --> 00:27:31.556
It's him and his wife

514
00:27:31.765 --> 00:27:34.935
and his kids.

515
00:27:35.143 --> 00:27:38.980
The police love to get their claws
into idiots like that.


516
00:27:39.189 --> 00:27:41.900
Oh, Garvey's all right.

517
00:27:42.108 --> 00:27:43.735
Based on what?

518
00:27:43.944 --> 00:27:46.196
Well, you know, my instincts.

519
00:27:46.404 --> 00:27:48.531
Yeah well, that's bullshit.

520
00:27:56.289 --> 00:27:59.042
We quite like
the name Enoch


521
00:27:59.251 --> 00:28:01.795
or Norbert.

522
00:28:02.003 --> 00:28:03.713
Norbert?

523
00:28:03.922 --> 00:28:05.340
- It's all right.
- Look...


524
00:28:05.548 --> 00:28:07.175
Unusual...
it's an unusual name.


525
00:28:07.384 --> 00:28:09.386
It's medieval apparently.

526
00:28:09.594 --> 00:28:12.264
- Bill is a good strong name.
- Bill?


527
00:28:12.472 --> 00:28:15.600
Oh yeah, like,
no prejudice. Sure.


528
00:28:15.809 --> 00:28:17.569
I don't know how Valda
would feel about that,


529
00:28:17.727 --> 00:28:19.729
but I'm having a feeling
though that she probably


530
00:28:19.938 --> 00:28:22.148
wouldn't like the idea
very much at all.


531
00:28:22.357 --> 00:28:25.235
- Or Billina for a girl.
- Billina's not even a name.


532
00:28:25.443 --> 00:28:27.445
Check the book. It's not in there.
I guarantee it.


533
00:28:27.654 --> 00:28:31.700
I think you'll find the feminine version
of William is...


534
00:28:31.908 --> 00:28:33.660
- It's Wilhelmina.
- Wilhelmina.


535
00:28:33.868 --> 00:28:38.748
So it could be Billelmina,
or short... Billina.


536
00:28:41.084 --> 00:28:43.044
How come there's no pictures
of me in this album?


537
00:28:43.253 --> 00:28:47.007
This is 1979. I should be all
over this album.


538
00:28:47.215 --> 00:28:49.467
I've told you a million times...

539
00:28:49.676 --> 00:28:51.136
photos were expensive
in those days.


540
00:28:51.344 --> 00:28:53.596
Now hang on a second.
There's loads of pictures.


541
00:28:53.805 --> 00:28:57.350
There's loads of pictures of you two,
of this dog that I don't remember.


542
00:28:57.559 --> 00:28:59.561
And then...

543
00:29:02.063 --> 00:29:04.190
I think that's my foot.

544
00:29:05.608 --> 00:29:09.029
I never took any photos.

545
00:29:09.237 --> 00:29:11.364
Well, somebody took
a lot of pictures.


546
00:29:11.573 --> 00:29:14.117
It wasn't me.

547
00:29:24.586 --> 00:29:27.922
- ♪ Are you going to... ♪
- Is that my Gibson?


548
00:29:28.131 --> 00:29:31.217
♪ Are you going ♪

549
00:29:31.426 --> 00:29:34.346
♪ To Scarborough Fair? ♪

550
00:29:34.554 --> 00:29:37.015
That guitar's worth
more than you are.


551
00:29:37.223 --> 00:29:40.101
It's not a fucking Gibson!

552
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.521
Jesus, I gotta fucking listen to you
play, like, night and fucking day


553
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.732
the whole time with
your pals and whatnot.


554
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.276
Why don't you learn some chords?

555
00:29:51.196 --> 00:29:53.365
I mean somewhere else.

556
00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:04.626
- Hey, Karl.
- Hi, Chris.


557
00:30:04.834 --> 00:30:06.419
- You all right?
- How's tricks?


558
00:30:06.628 --> 00:30:08.797
- Come in.
- Not too bad, mate. Not too bad.


559
00:30:09.005 --> 00:30:11.766
- Good to see you two out and about, anyway.
- Can you close the door?


560
00:30:11.883 --> 00:30:15.220
Hello. Hello.
How are you?


561
00:30:15.428 --> 00:30:17.180
- Oop!
- Where are we? In here?


562
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:18.932
- Out the back.
- All right.


563
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.380
I'll leave this pram here in the hall.
Is that all right?


564
00:30:21.476 --> 00:30:23.436
It's Chris Pringle.
Yeah, that's fine, mate.


565
00:30:23.603 --> 00:30:25.397
It'll be safe enough, won't it?

566
00:30:25.605 --> 00:30:27.525
- There you go.
- Hello, Mr. Pringle.


567
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:29.609
- How you doing? You all right?
- Yeah yeah.


568
00:30:29.692 --> 00:30:31.012
Good to see you two
out and about.


569
00:30:31.111 --> 00:30:33.655
- I want Grandpappy.
- All right, sweetheart.


570
00:30:33.863 --> 00:30:36.199
Grandpa.

571
00:30:36.408 --> 00:30:38.368
- Lovely, isn't he?
- Good boy.


572
00:30:38.576 --> 00:30:41.454
- Grandpa, Grandpa.
- How old's your boy now?


573
00:30:41.663 --> 00:30:45.667
Um... three.

574
00:30:45.875 --> 00:30:49.421
Ah, that's a nice age.

575
00:30:49.629 --> 00:30:52.966
- Had his first fight the other day.
- Yeah?


576
00:30:53.174 --> 00:30:54.843
- He's an indi...
- A little snapper.


577
00:30:55.051 --> 00:30:56.678
He's an individual, is he?
Like his dad?


578
00:30:56.886 --> 00:30:59.180
Yeah, twatted this kid
with a xylophone.


579
00:30:59.389 --> 00:31:00.682
- It was brilliant.
- Really?


580
00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.370
Yeah yeah yeah.
So I'll show you that.


581
00:31:02.434 --> 00:31:04.394
He twats him with a xylophone

582
00:31:04.602 --> 00:31:07.202
and I'd taught him the two fingers
into the throat routine, right?


583
00:31:07.313 --> 00:31:09.232
So I'd seen his eyes go...
'cause he's got his dad's eyes.


584
00:31:09.441 --> 00:31:11.443
The next minute, he's across the table
with a finger in...


585
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:13.611
"No!"
Pulls him back.


586
00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.239
He's at him like he's a fucking junior
ninja. So they pulled him back.


587
00:31:16.448 --> 00:31:18.533
I sees the look in the teacher's eyes, man.
He shat himself.


588
00:31:18.741 --> 00:31:20.702
- A brick in his underpants.
- Oi, Chris...


589
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.620
Chris, he looks just like you.

590
00:31:22.829 --> 00:31:24.330
Of course he fucking does.

591
00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:25.915
Yeah,
come on then, Kurt.


592
00:31:26.124 --> 00:31:27.524
Do you want to help me
make the tea?


593
00:31:27.584 --> 00:31:29.294
When I was out
in Bosnia, you know...


594
00:31:29.502 --> 00:31:31.222
well, actually I went down
to have a holiday


595
00:31:31.337 --> 00:31:33.173
and ended up just having
a go in the war.


596
00:31:33.381 --> 00:31:35.341
- Cheap beer.
- Were you in the army, Chris?


597
00:31:35.467 --> 00:31:38.094
Which one?
Floated about.


598
00:31:38.303 --> 00:31:40.930
Don't fight for no king,
no country... no queen, no country.


599
00:31:41.139 --> 00:31:43.725
- I'm my own principality. Know what I'm saying?
- Amen.


600
00:31:43.933 --> 00:31:45.435
Yeah. Amen.
Testify, brother.


601
00:31:45.643 --> 00:31:47.363
- You know the truth.
- Passport to Pringle.


602
00:31:47.479 --> 00:31:49.272
- Huh?
- Passport to Pringle.


603
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:52.525
- What does that mean?
- Oh.


604
00:31:52.734 --> 00:31:55.534
So I'm standing there in the court...

605
00:31:55.737 --> 00:31:57.537
and all of a sudden...

606
00:31:57.614 --> 00:31:58.990
Less of that bit, will you?

607
00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:00.700
- Sorry?
- Less of that.


608
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:02.869
I don't mind the cuddling,
but none of the kissing


609
00:32:03.036 --> 00:32:06.039
and farting noises, all right?

610
00:32:06.247 --> 00:32:08.041
Just stay where I can see you.

611
00:32:08.249 --> 00:32:10.249
Play up and down the hall if you want.
That's fine.


612
00:32:10.293 --> 00:32:13.546
But don't be taking him
into your other room or anything.


613
00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:17.425
Listen, if youse boys
need anything done,


614
00:32:17.634 --> 00:32:20.011
just give me a shout, won't you?

615
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.556
- So...
- Hmm?


616
00:32:23.765 --> 00:32:27.769
Oh, of course. Don't worry.

617
00:32:27.977 --> 00:32:30.647
Got the car out the back...
hatchback.


618
00:32:30.855 --> 00:32:32.690
A roll of carpet, gaffer tape,

619
00:32:32.899 --> 00:32:34.567
lump hammer...
it's all there.


620
00:32:34.776 --> 00:32:37.820
Good to go.
Shovel, small handle.


621
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:40.031
Give me 15 minutes...
boom, South Downs.


622
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.659
- Good boy.
- All right?


623
00:32:42.867 --> 00:32:44.619
Modern life these days, you see?

624
00:32:44.827 --> 00:32:47.067
- You gotta market.
- You got a point there, Chris.


625
00:32:47.247 --> 00:32:50.083
- Have you got a web presence?
- Not yet.


626
00:32:50.291 --> 00:32:52.293
Listen, catch youse later,
all right?


627
00:32:52.502 --> 00:32:54.963
Nice to see you.
Keep it...


628
00:32:55.171 --> 00:32:57.090
- keep it tight.
- Have a good one.


629
00:32:57.298 --> 00:33:00.134
- Nice to see your kid as well, man.
- He's lovely, isn't he?


630
00:33:00.343 --> 00:33:01.719
He took to you, didn't he?

631
00:33:01.928 --> 00:33:03.721
Come on.
Come on, sweetheart.


632
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.349
- You gonna go with your dad?
- Is he up the stairs?


633
00:33:09.394 --> 00:33:11.729
I was thinking about
having Valda round,


634
00:33:11.938 --> 00:33:13.231
having a bit of dinner.

635
00:33:13.439 --> 00:33:14.732
I suppose.
Maggie?


636
00:33:14.941 --> 00:33:17.110
I haven't got much in.

637
00:33:17.318 --> 00:33:20.029
I'll cook it.

638
00:33:21.114 --> 00:33:23.241
Yeah, fine.

639
00:33:25.076 --> 00:33:28.413
- Karl.
- Yeah?


640
00:33:28.621 --> 00:33:30.373
Look at this glass
you've just given me.


641
00:33:30.582 --> 00:33:32.041
Say again?

642
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.419
Well, I'm not going
to say anything.


643
00:33:34.627 --> 00:33:37.463
Would you mind
having a look at that?


644
00:33:37.672 --> 00:33:39.173
It's fine.

645
00:33:40.967 --> 00:33:44.053
You know, this is the first time
I've come over for dinner.


646
00:33:44.262 --> 00:33:47.390
Really? Hmm.
That was rude of us.


647
00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:49.976
How long did you go out together?
About three weeks?


648
00:33:50.184 --> 00:33:52.812
- A year.
- A year?


649
00:33:53.021 --> 00:33:54.314
Is that right, Maggie?

650
00:33:54.522 --> 00:33:56.941
- Was it that long?
- A year.


651
00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.819
Oh, yeah. Well, what do you
see in him then?


652
00:34:00.028 --> 00:34:01.788
What do you mean?
There's lots to see in him.


653
00:34:01.863 --> 00:34:04.157
Dad, just...
Please, Dad, just...


654
00:34:04.365 --> 00:34:06.534
It's not an interrogation, yeah?
It's just...


655
00:34:10.913 --> 00:34:12.415
To happy families, all right?

656
00:34:12.624 --> 00:34:14.542
Tonight at least.
Happy families.


657
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:16.586
- Happy families.
- All right, okay.


658
00:34:16.794 --> 00:34:19.172
- Happy families.
- Cheers, everyone. Cheers, Mom.


659
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.965
Do you need a hand?

660
00:34:21.174 --> 00:34:23.051
Oh, fuck.
Shit, fuck.


661
00:34:23.259 --> 00:34:25.261
I don't really see
my parents much anymore.


662
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:28.473
- Oh, why's that?
- Personal reasons.


663
00:34:28.681 --> 00:34:32.435
Ma, have we got a...
a thing for the pasta?


664
00:34:32.644 --> 00:34:34.020
Oh, it's all right.
I found it.


665
00:34:34.228 --> 00:34:35.548
So he does a lot of cooking

666
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.398
around here then, Bill?

667
00:34:37.607 --> 00:34:38.967
- No. He hardly ever cooks.
- Shit.


668
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.069
He's only cooking
because you're here.


669
00:34:41.277 --> 00:34:44.072
It's very nice of him
to make the effort, isn't it?


670
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.532
Well, he can be
a good lad, yeah.


671
00:34:46.741 --> 00:34:48.743
He's all right really.

672
00:34:48.951 --> 00:34:50.578
Only the best tonight.

673
00:34:50.787 --> 00:34:52.622
Do you know what this
is called, this pattern?


674
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.708
- Is it the willow?
- Yeah, it's the willow pattern.


675
00:34:55.917 --> 00:34:58.544
It's a story about
runaway lovers, isn't it?


676
00:34:58.753 --> 00:35:00.338
Going over the bridge, I think.

677
00:35:00.546 --> 00:35:02.590
Is that right?

678
00:35:02.799 --> 00:35:04.799
- Did they have a happy ending?
- I don't think so.


679
00:35:04.884 --> 00:35:06.928
Oh, I think that's
what the birds are.


680
00:35:07.136 --> 00:35:10.598
I think maybe that's the souls of the
lovers after they've been murdered.


681
00:35:10.807 --> 00:35:12.934
What it is, I can tell you,

682
00:35:13.142 --> 00:35:18.606
is the lovers...

683
00:35:18.815 --> 00:35:23.820
got chased
over the bridge by her dad,


684
00:35:24.028 --> 00:35:26.906
who's the fisherman,
and he trapped them on the island


685
00:35:27.115 --> 00:35:29.283
and broke down the bridge.

686
00:35:29.492 --> 00:35:32.870
They were trapped forever, but then
they turned into birds and they were free.


687
00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:35.581
- He's a fountain of knowledge, isn't he?
- I never knew that.


688
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.449
Had those since our wedding...
never knew.


689
00:35:38.474 --> 00:35:39.359
Ah.

690
00:35:39.544 --> 00:35:41.963
- Lovely.
- Mm, you win 20p.


691
00:35:42.171 --> 00:35:43.923
A bit of salad there, Mom?

692
00:35:44.132 --> 00:35:47.593
Well, I can't say
that you're not pretty.


693
00:35:47.802 --> 00:35:49.846
- There he goes, the charmer.
- Thanks.


694
00:35:50.054 --> 00:35:52.348
- Yeah.
- Aren't you?


695
00:35:52.557 --> 00:35:56.352
Well, you know,
if I was 20 years younger...


696
00:35:56.561 --> 00:35:59.522
- He was a devil.
- It's more like 35 years younger, Dad.


697
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:02.358
Oh, all right, 35 years.

698
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:06.988
When he had hair.

699
00:36:07.196 --> 00:36:09.198
Karl, could you get me
some water, please?


700
00:36:10.324 --> 00:36:12.493
Thank you.

701
00:36:12.702 --> 00:36:15.913
I think your problem is you don't give Karl
enough credit.


702
00:36:16.956 --> 00:36:18.332
That's not true.

703
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:21.461
Well, if I'm honest,
I think you bully him.


704
00:36:21.669 --> 00:36:23.296
You just pick at him
all the time.


705
00:36:23.504 --> 00:36:26.758
Pick pick pick.
You just get at him all the time.


706
00:36:26.966 --> 00:36:29.469
Look, it's banter. You don't understand
how this house works.


707
00:36:29.677 --> 00:36:31.012
I think I do.

708
00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.389
- Is she always this mouthy?
- What?


709
00:36:33.598 --> 00:36:35.518
We can't all be
Father Christmas, can we?


710
00:36:35.683 --> 00:36:39.437
- I'm just being myself, Karl, don't worry.
- Girls like you...


711
00:36:39.645 --> 00:36:41.481
- pregnant...
- Dad.


712
00:36:41.689 --> 00:36:42.982
I bet you don't
even know who by.


713
00:36:43.191 --> 00:36:44.591
Karl, are you going
to say anything?


714
00:36:44.734 --> 00:36:46.110
- Dad...
- Look...


715
00:36:46.319 --> 00:36:47.987
Dad, Dad!

716
00:36:48.196 --> 00:36:50.782
Look, if she says it's mine,
it's mine, all right?


717
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:53.075
Mom...

718
00:36:54.827 --> 00:36:56.871
You should have known, Karl.

719
00:36:57.079 --> 00:36:59.290
You should have known that
this was not a good idea.


720
00:36:59.499 --> 00:37:02.418
I know, but she's got...
she's got my baby.


721
00:37:02.627 --> 00:37:05.755
I've got a fucking headache now.

722
00:37:05.963 --> 00:37:09.467
Mom, listen, just...
please, can you just stop him?


723
00:37:09.675 --> 00:37:11.835
- I'll be all right. Get back in there.
- Just help me.


724
00:37:11.928 --> 00:37:14.597
I'll be all right
when I've had a drink.


725
00:37:18.017 --> 00:37:20.311
Beam me up.

726
00:37:30.112 --> 00:37:32.240
Do you want some help, Karl?

727
00:37:32.448 --> 00:37:35.159
Yeah well, there's a bit of pudding.
I'll bring it in.


728
00:37:39.747 --> 00:37:41.249
I thought there was
some vino coming.


729
00:37:41.457 --> 00:37:43.167
No, I'll bring it in
in a minute, Dad.


730
00:37:43.376 --> 00:37:45.616
Let me get the pudding sorted out,
get it ready to serve.


731
00:37:45.795 --> 00:37:48.714
- Yeah, thanks, Maggie.
- I just wanted to have a look at you.


732
00:37:48.923 --> 00:37:52.343
Yeah. Why was it
you and he split up then?


733
00:37:52.552 --> 00:37:54.512
I don't know.

734
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.639
It just didn't work out.

735
00:37:56.848 --> 00:37:59.892
Quite a lot of temper, fights.

736
00:38:00.101 --> 00:38:02.895
But he seems to have,
you know, mellowed a bit.


737
00:38:03.104 --> 00:38:05.147
Yeah, he's got a temper on him,

738
00:38:05.356 --> 00:38:06.649
but we're on top of it now.

739
00:38:06.858 --> 00:38:08.484
He got new pills.

740
00:38:08.693 --> 00:38:10.695
What do you mean?

741
00:38:12.864 --> 00:38:16.033
Well, he has a few mood swings,
doesn't he?


742
00:38:16.242 --> 00:38:19.704
- But he's a lovely lad.
- He's... he is a lovely lad.


743
00:38:21.163 --> 00:38:23.541
Good night.

744
00:38:23.749 --> 00:38:26.627
- I'm sorry it was a bit harsh.
- Don't worry about it.


745
00:38:26.836 --> 00:38:29.422
- It was entertaining.
- I'm sorry you didn't like the food.


746
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.299
It was fine.
It was fine.


747
00:38:31.507 --> 00:38:34.677
It was very sweet
that you cooked.


748
00:38:34.886 --> 00:38:37.138
I thought you were, you know,
on good form tonight.


749
00:38:37.346 --> 00:38:39.348
I know.

750
00:38:47.773 --> 00:38:50.443
Okay, I'm gonna go.

751
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:52.320
- Give me a call.
- I will do.


752
00:38:52.528 --> 00:38:53.821
- I'll see you out.
- Okay.


753
00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.699
What a fucking little imbecile.

754
00:38:56.908 --> 00:38:58.409
Not in front of the boy.

755
00:38:58.618 --> 00:39:00.244
She's a sheep.
She's a follower.


756
00:39:00.453 --> 00:39:02.663
I don't bully him.
It's non-aggressive advice.


757
00:39:02.872 --> 00:39:05.666
Yeah, she's got
her hooks right in.


758
00:39:05.875 --> 00:39:07.793
It's absolutely typical of him.

759
00:39:08.002 --> 00:39:10.713
- That was good rowdy fun, yeah?
- Oh yeah, oh yeah.


760
00:39:10.922 --> 00:39:13.562
- It was good to see her again.
- Yeah, I'm really glad she's back.


761
00:39:13.716 --> 00:39:17.011
Yeah. She should lay off
the fatuous advice, though.


762
00:39:17.219 --> 00:39:19.299
- You know?
- She was just telling it how she saw it.


763
00:39:19.388 --> 00:39:20.681
Well, I think she should keep

764
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.433
that internal monologue
to herself


765
00:39:22.642 --> 00:39:24.143
and not share it
with the adults.


766
00:39:24.352 --> 00:39:26.354
I'm playing at devil's advocate
here, Karl,


767
00:39:26.562 --> 00:39:29.148
but she's a bit,
you know, full of herself.


768
00:39:29.357 --> 00:39:33.319
In a nice way, I mean.
Conceited.


769
00:39:35.947 --> 00:39:38.157
I had a nice time.

770
00:40:28.082 --> 00:40:30.126
Garvey'll be around in a bit.

771
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.463
Hide the fucking pies, yeah?

772
00:40:34.672 --> 00:40:37.925
- Where does your missus think you are?
- Late at the club.


773
00:40:38.134 --> 00:40:40.344
I don't know why
I couldn't tell her what's happening.


774
00:40:40.553 --> 00:40:42.913
I told you, it's so she can't be put
in a position later on.


775
00:40:43.014 --> 00:40:45.224
- And no phones.
- Yeah, I left it at home. Don't worry.


776
00:40:45.433 --> 00:40:46.934
- So what's going on?
- Nothing much.


777
00:40:47.143 --> 00:40:48.769
Just tying up a few loose ends.

778
00:40:52.148 --> 00:40:54.734
- Was it you?
- What?


779
00:40:57.486 --> 00:40:59.030
Fucking hell!
Are you mental?


780
00:40:59.238 --> 00:41:01.323
I've done... I've done
fuck all to deserve this?


781
00:41:01.532 --> 00:41:04.243
- Calm down.
- What's going on? You lure me out here...


782
00:41:04.452 --> 00:41:06.287
What's this?

783
00:41:15.421 --> 00:41:17.941
Look, listen, I couldn't get a sitter.
Can we sort this out now?


784
00:41:18.132 --> 00:41:19.550
- Fuck's sake.
- Ears!


785
00:41:19.759 --> 00:41:22.053
Shit, that's Chris Pringle!

786
00:41:22.261 --> 00:41:24.138
Calm down, lad.
It's nothing personal.


787
00:41:24.346 --> 00:41:27.349
- What the fuck's he doing here?
- An impartial observer.


788
00:41:27.558 --> 00:41:28.768
Fuck that!

789
00:41:32.104 --> 00:41:34.398
Come here, you fat bastard.

790
00:41:41.489 --> 00:41:44.700
- Bill, what's going on?
- Everything's okay, Maggie. Don't worry.


791
00:41:44.909 --> 00:41:48.162
Yeah, it's just a bit
of boisterous fun, Ma.


792
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:52.124
- Put it through, Bill?
- No, don't break it down. It's Victorian.


793
00:41:52.333 --> 00:41:54.933
So what have... what have youse got here?
Like, you got any tools?


794
00:41:55.086 --> 00:41:56.921
Like a knife?
A knife would be good.


795
00:41:57.129 --> 00:41:59.169
- You didn't bring anything?
- This is amateur hour.


796
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:01.717
- No, I was in a rush.
- Dude, what the fuck?


797
00:42:01.926 --> 00:42:04.606
- I've got a kid, you know.
- Are you on a fucking... you on a meter?


798
00:42:04.637 --> 00:42:06.918
Even leaving the fucking house
is like a lifestyle choice.


799
00:42:07.014 --> 00:42:08.766
You're like my fucking missus.

800
00:42:08.974 --> 00:42:11.143
I've got the fucking kid.
I've got to go to work with the kid.


801
00:42:11.352 --> 00:42:13.062
Yeah. He's having
a kid as well.


802
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.689
Oh, are you?
You having a kid?


803
00:42:15.898 --> 00:42:17.983
That's brilliant.
Congratulations, son.


804
00:42:18.192 --> 00:42:20.152
Come on, hug it up, bitch.

805
00:42:20.361 --> 00:42:22.780
- Cheers, Pringle.
- Oh, man.


806
00:42:22.988 --> 00:42:25.788
- Dude, what are we gonna do...
- Look, let's finish this amateur hour.


807
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.328
- Oh, fuck, yeah.
- Keep it down, man. He's in there.


808
00:42:29.537 --> 00:42:31.831
Well, he knows
we're fucking out here.


809
00:42:32.039 --> 00:42:35.000
- Let's flush him out.
- I don't want any...


810
00:42:35.209 --> 00:42:36.877
Come out, you little fucker.

811
00:42:37.086 --> 00:42:38.712
I'm gonna come in there
and get you.


812
00:42:38.921 --> 00:42:41.132
I'm gonna fuck you up the ass
and set your hair on fire.


813
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.740
- Fuck off, Pringle.
- I'm fucking sick of this shit.


814
00:42:43.926 --> 00:42:46.679
A little bit strong.
Come on, he's a mate.


815
00:42:46.887 --> 00:42:48.973
Look, sorry about that.
Sorry, all right?


816
00:42:51.517 --> 00:42:54.103
Would little Kurt like some squash,
Christopher?


817
00:42:54.311 --> 00:42:57.398
- Nothing artificial, Maggie. Thanks, though.
- Oh, okay.


818
00:42:57.606 --> 00:43:00.234
- Are my vitamin supplements ready, Maggie?
- Yeah, come through.


819
00:43:00.442 --> 00:43:02.361
Come on, out.

820
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:05.823
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

821
00:43:06.031 --> 00:43:08.659

disgraceful cock-up.

Listen, I'm not
used to having him


851
00:44:55.057 --> 00:44:57.097
under my feet all frickin' day
when I'm doing a job.

You oughta toughen up, mate.

853
00:44:58.978 --> 00:45:00.396
You've left me
right in the shit.


854
00:45:00.604 --> 00:45:02.189
Is he still up there?

855
00:45:02.398 --> 00:45:04.775
Oh, fucking hell.
Nice one, Pringle, you spastic.


856
00:45:04.984 --> 00:45:06.544
Fucking forget about it.
I'm outta here.


857
00:45:06.735 --> 00:45:08.737
Come on, love.

858
00:45:09.989 --> 00:45:13.826
- Yeah, cheers.
- That's lame.


859
00:45:15.703 --> 00:45:17.746
Are you gonna wait this out?
My eyes are shutting.


860
00:45:17.955 --> 00:45:19.790
I'm taking
my sleepers, okay?


861
00:45:19.999 --> 00:45:23.085
- I don't want any noise.
- Yeah, night, Mom.


862
00:45:36.307 --> 00:45:40.019
- Garv, are you coming out?
- No. Fuck off.


863
00:45:40.227 --> 00:45:42.604
Mate, it's just
getting silly now.


864
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.525
Garv, I don't know what
you think we're doing, mate,


865
00:45:46.734 --> 00:45:48.068
but you've got it all wrong.

866
00:45:48.277 --> 00:45:51.655
This has just...
this has just been a test.


867
00:45:51.864 --> 00:45:53.824
I've been nothing
but nice to you lot.


868
00:45:54.033 --> 00:45:56.952
Yeah, Garv, but it's, like,
been a test of character


869
00:45:57.161 --> 00:45:59.163
and you've passed it, mate...
flying colors.


870
00:45:59.371 --> 00:46:02.082
- It's all sweet now.
- Really?


871
00:46:02.291 --> 00:46:03.917
Yeah, come down
and smoke the peace pipe.


872
00:46:04.126 --> 00:46:06.628
We'll forget all about this.

873
00:46:06.837 --> 00:46:10.924
Garv, I swear on my unborn kid

874
00:46:11.133 --> 00:46:13.218
we're not going to do anything.

875
00:46:13.427 --> 00:46:16.305
- Is that fucking animal Pringle out there?
- Pringle's gone, mate.


876
00:46:16.513 --> 00:46:19.767
I don't even know
what he was doing here.


877
00:46:19.975 --> 00:46:22.436
All right, I'm coming out.

878
00:46:25.064 --> 00:46:27.399
Come on, you great lump.

879
00:46:27.608 --> 00:46:29.902
We never suspected you
for a minute, mate.


880
00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:32.154
You're getting paranoid
in your old age.


881
00:46:32.363 --> 00:46:34.365
Yeah, you are, Garv.

882
00:46:36.992 --> 00:46:38.952
It's not him, is it?

883
00:46:39.161 --> 00:46:40.662
I don't know.
I'm tired.


884
00:46:40.871 --> 00:46:43.499
He reacted all wrong.
I'm good at reading people.


885
00:46:43.707 --> 00:46:45.167
He made a run for it.

886
00:46:45.376 --> 00:46:48.337
Not an unnatural response
in the circumstances.


887
00:46:48.545 --> 00:46:50.506
No, I'm talking about
your general aura.


888
00:46:50.714 --> 00:46:52.114
You know, he's a clown.
He's a fool.


889
00:46:52.257 --> 00:46:54.259
He's innocent.

890
00:46:54.468 --> 00:46:56.470
All right.

891
00:46:57.805 --> 00:46:59.848
Garv.

892
00:47:03.102 --> 00:47:05.312
- So you having a baby, eh?
- Yep.


893
00:47:05.521 --> 00:47:08.273
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.


894
00:47:08.482 --> 00:47:10.901
I was trying for months
with Helen,


895
00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:13.529
but she had a problem
with her uterus.


896
00:47:13.737 --> 00:47:15.937
- Well, I did not know that, Garv.
- I'll tell you what.


897
00:47:16.031 --> 00:47:18.117
I want to ask you something.

898
00:47:18.325 --> 00:47:20.494
On the night the twins
were conceived


899
00:47:20.702 --> 00:47:22.454
I made this, like,
roaring noise.


900
00:47:22.663 --> 00:47:24.248
I'd never done that before.

901
00:47:24.456 --> 00:47:27.209
- Did you make a noise?
- Fuck knows.


902
00:47:27.418 --> 00:47:29.294
I don't know, but...

903
00:47:29.503 --> 00:47:31.797
So what's the name
of the lucky mom-to-be?


904
00:47:32.005 --> 00:47:34.299
- Valda.
- Valda.


905
00:47:34.508 --> 00:47:36.552
Valda Newland?

906
00:47:37.928 --> 00:47:39.346
- Why? Do you know her?
- Yeah yeah.


907
00:47:39.555 --> 00:47:42.266
She went out with my brother
a few months ago.


908
00:47:42.474 --> 00:47:44.643
- Really?
- Yeah yeah yeah.


909
00:47:44.852 --> 00:47:47.271
They were pen pals together.

910
00:47:47.479 --> 00:47:48.897
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


911
00:47:49.106 --> 00:47:51.733
She's had loads
of pen pals from prison.


912
00:47:51.942 --> 00:47:54.862
She's a... she's a lovely girl.
She's got a big heart.


913
00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.156
Well done.

914
00:48:02.453 --> 00:48:04.246
I'm painting tomorrow.

915
00:48:04.455 --> 00:48:06.415
- What, in here?
- Yeah, all around.


916
00:48:06.623 --> 00:48:08.792
- What color?
- Just white.


917
00:48:09.001 --> 00:48:10.919
Oh yeah, nice.
Fresh start.


918
00:48:11.128 --> 00:48:13.922
- Can you do me a favor for a second, Garv?
- Yeah, of course.


919
00:48:14.131 --> 00:48:17.217
- Can you just hold this up?
- Right.


920
00:48:17.426 --> 00:48:20.304
- Just there.
- Yeah.


921
00:48:20.512 --> 00:48:22.514
Actually, I'm pretty knackered.

922
00:48:22.723 --> 00:48:24.363
You couldn't do us a tea,
could you, Karl?


923
00:48:24.558 --> 00:48:26.185
- Yeah, sure.
- What time is it?


924
00:48:26.393 --> 00:48:28.103
I've got the kids tomorrow.

925
00:48:28.312 --> 00:48:31.023
Ah!

926
00:48:31.231 --> 00:48:33.484
Fuck your kids.

927
00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.494
Eric, it's Karl.
Yeah.


928
00:48:43.702 --> 00:48:46.288
Any chance you could
possibly pop over?


929
00:48:48.332 --> 00:48:50.459
Yeah, I'm gonna need
your help with something.


930
00:48:50.667 --> 00:48:52.794
Come the back way, yeah?

931
00:48:53.003 --> 00:48:55.464

are you here to do?


949

I'm here to help, all right?

00:49:56.024 --> 00:49:58.485

- Take a fucking turn!

00:49:58.694 --> 00:50:00.654
It's not a fucking
two-man shovel, is it?

00:50:00.862 --> 00:50:03.407
You take your turn,
then I'll take over.


953
00:50:03.615 --> 00:50:06.076
This is bollocks. We'll never get him
into this ground, mate.


954
00:50:06.285 --> 00:50:08.925
- We're just gonna have to leave him.
- We can't fucking leave him.


955
00:50:09.079 --> 00:50:10.789
We'll just have to fucking think of
something else.

There's no fucking
soft ground in there.

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:30.077
- What, your forthcoming progeny?
- Yeah.


978
00:51:30.285 --> 00:51:32.746
Science suggests
it'll be a girl.


979
00:51:35.957 --> 00:51:37.542
Why would it suggest that?

980
00:51:37.751 --> 00:51:40.879
Because the man determines
the sex of the child.


981
00:51:41.088 --> 00:51:45.008
So what diff...
what does that mean?


982
00:51:45.217 --> 00:51:48.470
- Well, you're that type.
- What type?


983
00:51:48.679 --> 00:51:50.472
Well, the type
that science talks about.


984
00:51:50.681 --> 00:51:53.183
What, the type of person
that only has girls?


985
00:51:53.392 --> 00:51:56.019
What, you think
I've only got girl sperm?


986
00:51:56.228 --> 00:51:59.147
Listen, man, you can't
argue with science.


987
00:52:02.693 --> 00:52:04.569
Who'd call their kid Misery?

988
00:52:08.657 --> 00:52:11.368
Dad, that's the door.

989
00:52:14.579 --> 00:52:16.289
Pa, that's the door.

990
00:52:19.918 --> 00:52:22.295
Oh, fucking hell.
Don't get up.


991
00:52:26.883 --> 00:52:28.760
- All right, Karl.
- All right, Dave.


992
00:52:28.969 --> 00:52:30.849
- I hear you're getting married.
- That's right.


993
00:52:31.054 --> 00:52:34.891
Ducked 10 years and
ended up getting life, eh?


994
00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:38.311
- All right, Bill.
- Hello, Dave.


995
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.897
Garvey never went home
last night.


996
00:52:41.106 --> 00:52:42.733
Oh, yeah? Is that official?

997
00:52:42.941 --> 00:52:45.235
Yeah. I've had his missus
on the phone to mine.


998
00:52:45.444 --> 00:52:47.529
After one night?
He's on a short leash.


999
00:52:47.738 --> 00:52:50.198
He never goes away, does he?

1000
00:52:50.407 --> 00:52:52.784
So, uh, was he here?

1001
00:52:52.993 --> 00:52:56.580
- No.
- Not seen him.


1002
00:52:56.788 --> 00:52:58.582
Well, who was here last night?

1003
00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:00.834
Just... just Pringle.

1004
00:53:01.042 --> 00:53:03.670
Fucking hell.
Pringle.


1005
00:53:03.879 --> 00:53:06.423
That's non-helpful.

1006
00:53:06.631 --> 00:53:10.135
Right well, look,
if you see Garvey,


1007
00:53:10.343 --> 00:53:11.743
you get him to give me
a bell, yeah?


1008
00:53:11.845 --> 00:53:13.555
- Sure.
- Sure, will do.


1009
00:53:13.764 --> 00:53:16.308
- Yeah, well, I...
- We'll see you later, man.


1010
00:53:16.516 --> 00:53:18.727
I just don't want his missus...

1011
00:53:18.935 --> 00:53:21.605
Take it easy, Dave.
- scaring up a big search party.


1012
00:53:23.273 --> 00:53:25.484
I'll see you later.

1013
00:53:25.692 --> 00:53:30.197
- Well, where do you think Garvey is?
- I don't know. He's...


1014
00:53:32.991 --> 00:53:34.367
I don't like this.

1015
00:53:34.576 --> 00:53:37.162
Do you think Eric's
into much with Garvey?


1016
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:40.832
Eric owes Garvey money.

1017
00:53:41.041 --> 00:53:43.251
Quite a bit, knowing Eric.

1018
00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.338
Why? What's wrong?
What's Eric got to do with it?


1019
00:53:46.546 --> 00:53:49.508
Garvey's missing, that's all.
Nothing to worry about.


1020
00:53:57.015 --> 00:54:00.894
I think someone must have picked him up
between here and his drum.


1021
00:54:04.439 --> 00:54:07.901
- I can't go to prison, man.
- I know.


1022
00:54:08.109 --> 00:54:10.111
I'll never come out.

1023
00:54:19.621 --> 00:54:21.122
It's a confessional
culture, man.


1024
00:54:21.331 --> 00:54:22.707
People just can't shut up.

1025
00:54:22.916 --> 00:54:25.961
Pringle will go then, yeah?

1026
00:54:26.169 --> 00:54:29.506
- But who has he told?
- He lives with his mom.


1027
00:54:29.714 --> 00:54:32.175
The kid's with
his ex-missus.


1028
00:54:32.384 --> 00:54:34.553
It's unlikely he's gonna
say anything germane to her.


1029
00:54:34.761 --> 00:54:37.097
Yeah, let's hope not, eh?
What do you think, Bill?


1030
00:54:37.305 --> 00:54:39.683
I don't know.

1031
00:54:39.891 --> 00:54:41.685
Mags?

1032
00:54:41.893 --> 00:54:44.771
Pringle tells his war stories
to whoever'll listen.


1033
00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:46.982
The mom's a notorious
chatterbox.


1034
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.401
Just to be safe then, yeah?

1035
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:52.904
Okay.
This is on me then, yeah?


1036
00:54:54.614 --> 00:54:56.533
I'll deal with Pringle
and his people.


1037
00:54:56.741 --> 00:54:59.035
This is turning into
a right fucking massacre.


1038
00:54:59.244 --> 00:55:01.913
- Yay.
- What about the kid? He's got a kid.


1039
00:55:02.122 --> 00:55:04.666
Yeah, the kid's about two.
He can't even talk, can he?


1040
00:55:04.875 --> 00:55:06.751
I mean, what's going
to happen to the kid?


1041
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.337
He'll probably end up getting sent
to a decent school.


1042
00:55:09.546 --> 00:55:13.300
Would you want Pringle
as your old man?


1043
00:55:13.508 --> 00:55:15.594
Can't believe they've brought this
on themselves.


1044
00:55:15.802 --> 00:55:18.013
They're so selfish.

1045
00:55:18.221 --> 00:55:20.390
Disappearances
and accidents, Eric.


1046
00:55:20.599 --> 00:55:21.892
No showboating.

1047
00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:25.604
Bill, come on.

1048
00:55:30.191 --> 00:55:32.068
Here, Pa.

1049
00:55:32.277 --> 00:55:34.779
- Cheers.
- To Garvey.


1050
00:55:34.988 --> 00:55:37.115
Garvey.

1051
00:55:38.867 --> 00:55:42.120
- And Pringle.
- Yeah, and Pringle.


1052
00:55:42.329 --> 00:55:45.290
Pringle.

1053
00:55:45.498 --> 00:55:47.959
- A shame about his kid.
- Yeah.


1054
00:55:48.168 --> 00:55:51.504
Don't think about it.
I'm not.


1055
00:55:51.713 --> 00:55:53.506
Still...

1056
00:55:53.715 --> 00:55:54.995
that's the way
it goes, isn't it?


1057
00:55:55.133 --> 00:55:57.218
A lot of children die.

1058
00:55:57.427 --> 00:55:59.763
What time is it?

1059
00:55:59.971 --> 00:56:01.848
What, now?

1060
00:56:02.057 --> 00:56:05.060
It's about 25 past 4:00.

1061
00:56:05.268 --> 00:56:08.813
- Why, have you got an appointment?
- Nah, I was just wondering.


1062
00:56:17.656 --> 00:56:21.242
- It's just nice to be out of the house.
- Mm.


1063
00:56:23.578 --> 00:56:25.705
Sometimes don't you think
you could just walk


1064
00:56:25.914 --> 00:56:29.042
straight out into the sea
and never come back?


1065
00:56:32.087 --> 00:56:37.217
You're full of cheery little introspective
observations today.


1066
00:56:37.425 --> 00:56:40.011
What did you want to be
when you grew up?


1067
00:56:42.681 --> 00:56:45.517
Nothing.

1068
00:56:45.725 --> 00:56:47.978
How much do you love me?

1069
00:57:01.449 --> 00:57:03.952
Rah!

1070
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:07.163
Oi, Pringle.

1071
00:57:07.372 --> 00:57:09.124
- You all right, mate?
- How you doing?


1072
00:57:09.332 --> 00:57:11.052
- I've got a little job for you.
- Oh, yeah?


1073
00:57:11.126 --> 00:57:12.711
- Yeah. You up for it?
- Yeah, nice.


1074
00:57:12.919 --> 00:57:14.671
Come on, mate.

1075
00:57:14.879 --> 00:57:16.297
Come on, jump in.

1076
00:57:16.506 --> 00:57:18.008
It's lovely here, isn't it?

1077
00:57:18.216 --> 00:57:20.093
- Stinks of shit, mate.
- Yeah.


1078
00:57:20.301 --> 00:57:21.970
But I like those
fresh country smells.


1079
00:57:22.178 --> 00:57:25.598
- You know what I mean?
- So what's this all about?


1080
00:57:25.807 --> 00:57:28.560
Just gotta see a geezer over here.
Don't worry about it.


1081
00:57:28.768 --> 00:57:31.396
- Whereabouts?
- Just over here.


1082
00:57:31.604 --> 00:57:34.983
- By this caravan?
- No no, just by the side of the caravan.


1083
00:57:35.191 --> 00:57:37.861
Nothing to worry about.
Don't worry.


1084
00:57:42.157 --> 00:57:44.576
Aw, come on, man.
What about my son?


1085
00:57:44.784 --> 00:57:48.163
Oh, don't fucking cry,
mate. Oi!


1086
00:57:48.371 --> 00:57:50.832
Oh, for fuck's sake, where do you think
you're going?


1087
00:57:58.089 --> 00:58:00.967
Twat.

1088
00:58:09.934 --> 00:58:14.606
Ma, I'm gonna move out.

1089
00:58:14.814 --> 00:58:17.984
I thought Valda
was gonna move in here.


1090
00:58:18.193 --> 00:58:20.779
Val wants our own space.
I think she's right.


1091
00:58:20.987 --> 00:58:23.907
Well, you'll need help with the baby.
I mean, she looks frail.


1092
00:58:24.115 --> 00:58:26.951
I'm having a kid.
I can't go to prison.


1093
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:31.081
Nobody's going to prison
and you're going to do as you're told.


1094
00:58:32.665 --> 00:58:34.375
I don't want to do
any of this anymore.


1095
00:58:34.584 --> 00:58:36.586
I just want to be a...

1096
00:58:36.795 --> 00:58:38.797
I just want to be a normal dad.

1097
00:58:42.383 --> 00:58:44.219
- Mrs. Pringle?
- Yeah?


1098
00:58:44.427 --> 00:58:46.054
I'm a friend of your son's.

1099
00:58:46.262 --> 00:58:47.972
Eric, yeah?
You remember me?


1100
00:58:48.181 --> 00:58:50.517
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's fine, yeah.


1101
00:58:50.725 --> 00:58:52.644
You been shopping?
You bought anything nice?


1102
00:58:52.852 --> 00:58:54.604
Oh, just a few bits
for the kids, you know.


1103
00:58:54.813 --> 00:58:57.273
- Trying to cut back a bit these days.
- Yeah, times is tight.


1104
00:58:57.482 --> 00:58:59.842
- We've all got too much anyway, haven't we?
- That is true.


1105
00:58:59.984 --> 00:59:02.362
I can't believe how much he looks
like his old dad.


1106
00:59:02.570 --> 00:59:04.364
Yeah, poor little thing, eh?

1107
00:59:04.572 --> 00:59:06.533
What time is this bus
coming then?


1108
00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:15.166
- And the fat man?
- Oh, he's really shit the bed on this one, mate.


1109
00:59:15.375 --> 00:59:17.919
Looked all over for him...
high and low, here and there.


1110
00:59:18.128 --> 00:59:20.171
- Yeah?
- Pie shop.


1111
00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:24.175
- He's gone.
- Yeah, I thought so. I had a feeling.


1112
00:59:24.384 --> 00:59:26.219
- You want a whiskey?
- Yeah, lovely.


1113
00:59:26.427 --> 00:59:28.888
What's going on, you know,
with the business and...


1114
00:59:29.097 --> 00:59:30.807
and the club?

1115
00:59:31.015 --> 00:59:34.144
Well, looks like I'm gonna need
a new manager, doesn't it?


1116
00:59:34.352 --> 00:59:37.147
Yeah, I've been having
a little think about that.


1117
00:59:37.355 --> 00:59:39.065
- Cheers.
- Yeah?


1118
00:59:39.274 --> 00:59:43.862
Yeah, just, you know,
about who to put in there.


1119
00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.197
- Yeah.
- And then I thought,


1120
00:59:46.406 --> 00:59:48.158
I ran Foxy's, didn't I?

1121
00:59:48.366 --> 00:59:50.201
- For 10 years down in Eastbourne.
- Oh, yeah.


1122
00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:53.079
We did a great job down there, mate.
Great job.


1123
00:59:53.288 --> 00:59:54.956
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1124
00:59:55.165 --> 00:59:57.750
- That was a long time ago, Eric.
- I mean me and Karl...


1125
00:59:57.959 --> 01:00:00.712
- it would keep us busy.
- Karl's a very busy boy.


1126
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.966
Yeah. No, he's probably too busy,
but I've still got time.


1127
01:00:05.175 --> 01:00:07.427
I could help out down there.

1128
01:00:07.635 --> 01:00:11.181
I thought it'd, like,
dovetail with the business.


1129
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:17.187
Yeah. Well, I mean,
obviously I understand


1130
01:00:17.395 --> 01:00:21.107
where you're coming from,
but I'll leave it with you.


1131
01:00:21.316 --> 01:00:23.610
Have a little think
about it, mate.


1132
01:00:23.818 --> 01:00:25.570
I'll tell you what,
I'll think about it.


1133
01:00:25.778 --> 01:00:28.907
Yeah yeah, nice nice.
Okay. So what?


1134
01:00:29.115 --> 01:00:31.993
I'll call you later maybe,
have a chat?


1135
01:00:33.995 --> 01:00:36.915
I mean, it's a good idea...
a good idea, Bill,


1136
01:00:37.123 --> 01:00:40.835
because I feel that
the club could be...


1137
01:00:41.044 --> 01:00:43.254
I've got some ideas
for the club,


1138
01:00:43.463 --> 01:00:44.756
strategic ideas.

1139
01:00:51.221 --> 01:00:53.681
Running a club.

1140
01:00:56.226 --> 01:00:58.770
- Helen.
- Where is he?


1141
01:00:58.978 --> 01:01:01.147
- Bill?
- My husband!


1142
01:01:01.356 --> 01:01:02.774
How should I know?
I'm cooking.


1143
01:01:02.982 --> 01:01:05.151
- I just want his body!
- Shh, keep it down.


1144
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.904
- Whatever's left!
- Keep it down, keep it down.


1145
01:01:08.112 --> 01:01:10.031
I don't want him lying
out there in a ditch!


1146
01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.200
- Keep it... keep it...
- I won't keep it down!


1147
01:01:12.408 --> 01:01:16.746
Getting eaten up by...
by things and foxes, you fuck.


1148
01:01:16.955 --> 01:01:18.665
Look, you're under
a lot of stress, Helen.


1149
01:01:18.873 --> 01:01:20.713
I understand it, but it's totally
out of order.


1150
01:01:20.917 --> 01:01:23.836
You cold bitch.
You're just like your father.


1151
01:01:24.045 --> 01:01:26.047
- Get out of here.
- You'll end up just like him.


1152
01:01:28.591 --> 01:01:30.051
Unacceptable, Bill.

1153
01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:33.471
I told you when we started this...
no drama.


1154
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.099
She's a prime candidate
for shock treatment.


1155
01:01:36.307 --> 01:01:40.353
- Nobody is gonna listen to her ravings.
- Not listen?


1156
01:01:40.561 --> 01:01:42.730
I am surprised they didn't hear that
in fucking Kent.


1157
01:01:42.939 --> 01:01:45.149
Why'd she start talking
about my dad?


1158
01:01:45.358 --> 01:01:48.486
Why'd she have to say that?

1159
01:02:15.847 --> 01:02:18.349
Oh, Jonny.
How you doing, buddy?


1160
01:02:32.322 --> 01:02:34.782
- Jonny.
- Good journey, yeah?


1161
01:02:34.991 --> 01:02:37.910
Not really, no.

1162
01:02:38.119 --> 01:02:41.497
Well, what brings you
all the way down from London, Jon?


1163
01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:46.169
I told Jacob I didn't
want to come down, Bill.


1164
01:02:46.377 --> 01:02:48.755
Well, why didn't
he come down himself?


1165
01:02:50.923 --> 01:02:55.887
Jacob's a little, uh,
disappointed in you, Bill.


1166
01:02:58.598 --> 01:03:02.810
A general vibe of confusion

1167
01:03:03.019 --> 01:03:05.855
and carnage coming
from your end.


1168
01:03:06.064 --> 01:03:08.785
There's been a few ructions,
but it's evening out.


1169
01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:09.716
Is it?

1170
01:03:09.901 --> 01:03:11.611
Because it doesn't
feel that way.


1171
01:03:11.819 --> 01:03:14.947
It feels like it's spiraling
into chaos, Bill.


1172
01:03:15.156 --> 01:03:18.201
You and your idiot son
in and out of court,


1173
01:03:18.409 --> 01:03:19.827
police sniffing around
everything,


1174
01:03:20.036 --> 01:03:22.246
known associates
doing moonlight flits.


1175
01:03:22.455 --> 01:03:24.916
It's the last thing
we fucking need, Bill.


1176
01:03:25.124 --> 01:03:28.336
- Well, agree with me at least!
- All right, I agree.


1177
01:03:28.544 --> 01:03:30.963
I don't think you even know
what problems you have, Bill.


1178
01:03:31.172 --> 01:03:35.385
- Will you tell me then?
- I'm not here to explain things, Bill.


1179
01:03:37.095 --> 01:03:42.392
I'm here symbolically, yeah?

1180
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.771
As a reminder that we're all
in this together, yeah?


1181
01:03:46.979 --> 01:03:47.793
Yeah.

1182
01:03:47.818 --> 01:03:50.257
Some straight thinking
is called for, Bill.


1183
01:03:50.441 --> 01:03:53.152
- You've let things slip away.
- But I mean, look,


1184
01:03:53.361 --> 01:03:55.988
give this to Jacob and tell him
we're not falling behind.


1185
01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.827
This, Bill...
this is money, yeah?


1186
01:04:01.035 --> 01:04:04.163
You know there's more
to this than money.


1187
01:04:18.511 --> 01:04:21.222
- Sorted, Jonny?
- Sorted, Maggie.


1188
01:04:21.431 --> 01:04:24.225
Make sure he doesn't
get too excited, eh?


1189
01:04:24.434 --> 01:04:26.352
Yeah, I'm watching him, Jonny.

1190
01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.315
I know you can see
the bigger picture, yeah?


1191
01:04:31.524 --> 01:04:33.276
Yeah.

1192
01:04:34.485 --> 01:04:35.820
This house, eh...

1193
01:04:36.028 --> 01:04:38.823
- a lot of nice memories.
- Oh, yeah.


1194
01:04:39.031 --> 01:04:40.992
I don't want anything
to mess with that.


1195
01:04:43.744 --> 01:04:47.707
Well, it's only work, eh?

1196
01:04:50.585 --> 01:04:53.463
Nobody's gonna
mess it up, Jonny.

I'm having a stroke, Mags.

1206
01:05:56.359 --> 01:05:57.777
Call an ambulance.

1207
01:05:57.985 --> 01:06:00.446
I've poisoned you, Eric.

1208
01:06:00.655 --> 01:06:02.073
What?

1209
01:06:02.281 --> 01:06:05.910
What with?
What have you done?


1210
01:06:06.118 --> 01:06:09.288
You informed
on my husband and my kid


1211
01:06:09.497 --> 01:06:10.790
and then you killed Garvey.

1212
01:06:10.998 --> 01:06:12.792
It's causing all kinds
of complications.


1213
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.503
It's not true.

1214
01:06:15.711 --> 01:06:18.047
Maggie, it's not.
I swear.


1215
01:06:18.256 --> 01:06:20.299
You always was a wriggler,

1216
01:06:20.508 --> 01:06:21.801
even when you were a kid.

1217
01:06:24.428 --> 01:06:27.640
It's not true.
It wasn't me.


1218
01:06:32.562 --> 01:06:36.607
If you weren't family,
I wouldn't have anything to do with you.


1219
01:06:36.816 --> 01:06:39.610
I mean, look at
this bloody mess.


1220
01:06:39.819 --> 01:06:44.323
All I ever do is clear up
after bloody men.


1221
01:06:48.244 --> 01:06:50.663
Are you listening, Eric?

1222
01:06:53.708 --> 01:06:55.710
Christ.

1223
01:06:57.086 --> 01:06:59.422
Oh, well.

1224
01:07:01.716 --> 01:07:03.676
I mean, he could be
all right, your brother.


1225
01:07:03.884 --> 01:07:07.054
- We had some great laughs.
- Did we?


1226
01:07:07.263 --> 01:07:09.974
Yeah. It's a rotten thing
to have happened,


1227
01:07:10.182 --> 01:07:13.769
but tough decisions
have to be made.


1228
01:07:13.978 --> 01:07:16.480
It's not the decisions
that are tough, Bill.


1229
01:07:16.689 --> 01:07:18.983
It's the actions.

1230
01:07:19.191 --> 01:07:20.943
Well, a general
can't regret decisions


1231
01:07:21.152 --> 01:07:23.487
made in the heat of battle.

1232
01:07:23.696 --> 01:07:28.034
When all is said and done,
we will believe we were right.


1233
01:07:28.242 --> 01:07:30.995
It's important to have the right
intentions, no matter the outcome.


1234
01:07:31.203 --> 01:07:34.206

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:04.445
I haven't seen him
in a few days.

Eric's in Spain.

I think to...
to buy a bar.


1249
01:08:23.464 --> 01:08:25.383
I think he's gonna start a club

1250
01:08:25.591 --> 01:08:28.427
- called Los Foxos.
- No!

01:08:45.695 --> 01:08:48.447
Yeah. I think he must
have caught a whiff of a señorita.


1256
01:08:48.656 --> 01:08:52.493
You know what I mean? Got straight
to the airport and disappeared.

- Bullshit.

1340
01:15:38.273 --> 01:15:40.025
Had a good run,
though, didn't he?


1341
01:15:40.234 --> 01:15:42.194
He's left us right in it
though really, didn't he?


1342
01:15:42.319 --> 01:15:45.072
I mean, it's a bit selfish.

1343
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.116
I mean, would a bit
of exercise have hurt?


1344
01:15:47.324 --> 01:15:49.118
His poor wife.

1345
01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:54.331
Yeah, the old ones
all drop away.


1346
01:16:03.215 --> 01:16:06.051

the end of the world.


1347
01:16:07.511 --> 01:16:08.929
You're just tired.

1348
01:16:09.138 --> 01:16:12.182
It's all a bit fucking tiring.

1349
01:16:12.391 --> 01:16:16.728

Oh, Christ.

1351
01:18:48.672 --> 01:18:49.965
You see?

1352
01:18:50.173 --> 01:18:51.591
And you want
to leave this house?


1353
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.885
It's not safe for you
out there on your own.


1354
01:18:58.515 --> 01:19:03.145
- Who did this to you?
- One of yours, was he?


1355
01:19:03.353 --> 01:19:06.773
- What you are talking about?
- Well, it feels like your style.


1356
01:19:06.982 --> 01:19:09.192
And you call me sloppy.

1357
01:19:09.401 --> 01:19:11.778
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come off it.


1358
01:19:11.987 --> 01:19:14.948
Own up to it. Own it!
Fucking own it!


1359
01:19:15.157 --> 01:19:17.367
- Look what you fucking did to me.
- The situation's...


1360
01:19:17.576 --> 01:19:19.828
Look what you fucking did to me.

1361
01:19:20.037 --> 01:19:22.372
It's got nothing to do with me.
It's probably London.


1362
01:19:22.581 --> 01:19:26.626
That's bullshit and you fucking know it,
you fucking liar!


1363
01:19:26.835 --> 01:19:28.503
It could be a local faction
making a move.


1364
01:19:28.712 --> 01:19:30.505
How the fucking hell do I know?

1365
01:19:30.714 --> 01:19:32.883
I mean, I don't run
this town, man.


1366
01:19:33.091 --> 01:19:36.136
- It's like juggling oil now.
- You said it was all under control.


1367
01:19:36.345 --> 01:19:39.425
- You fucking told me it was all under control.
- That's an arrogant illusion.


1368
01:19:39.473 --> 01:19:41.308
It fucking is
an arrogant illusion,


1369
01:19:41.516 --> 01:19:44.353
and you're the fucking
arrogant one, you prick.


1370
01:19:44.561 --> 01:19:46.521
- Look, all...
- Fucking leave me alone, Dad.


1371
01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:48.899
I'm serious. Get out of my
fucking business.


1372
01:19:49.107 --> 01:19:51.068
I'm fucking serious.

1373
01:19:51.276 --> 01:19:53.612
I don't wanna hear
another fucking word from you.


1374
01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.906
- I'll fucking knock you out.
- Yeah?


1375
01:19:56.114 --> 01:19:57.574
Well, all I know is, all right,

1376
01:19:57.783 --> 01:19:59.451
one, investigations;

1377
01:19:59.659 --> 01:20:02.996
two, that fucking woman
turns up;


1378
01:20:03.205 --> 01:20:05.499
three, a trusted associate
goes missing...


1379
01:20:05.707 --> 01:20:09.961
Stand fucking back, man. I'll put
these glasses in your fucking face.


1380
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:12.005
I'm not kidding.

1381
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:15.008
Yeah?
And four,


1382
01:20:15.217 --> 01:20:17.135
a representative
of London comes down;


1383
01:20:17.344 --> 01:20:18.637
and five, you get attacked.

1384
01:20:18.845 --> 01:20:20.847
I mean, those are
the facts, right?


1385
01:20:22.307 --> 01:20:25.018
Saying them in a row
doesn't connect them.


1386
01:20:25.227 --> 01:20:27.646
It's got nothing to do with me.

1387
01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:30.607
Where's Eric?

1388
01:20:30.816 --> 01:20:32.576
- Do you even know if it's your kid?
- It is!


1389
01:20:32.776 --> 01:20:34.444
What the fuck?
Where is Eric?


1390
01:20:34.653 --> 01:20:37.197
Look, I'll be absolutely honest
with you, Karl.


1391
01:20:37.406 --> 01:20:39.533
She has to go.

1392
01:20:39.741 --> 01:20:43.703
- What are you talking about?
- It's her... Valda.


1393
01:20:43.912 --> 01:20:47.749
- Before the baby's born.
- What?


1394
01:20:47.958 --> 01:20:49.438
You'll be too attached
to her by then.


1395
01:20:49.584 --> 01:20:51.064
Are you out of your
fucking mind, Dad?


1396
01:20:51.253 --> 01:20:52.973
- We're getting married.
- Well, that's off.


1397
01:20:53.171 --> 01:20:55.465
No, we're getting married, Dad.
We're having a kid.


1398
01:20:55.674 --> 01:20:57.801
We're... we're getting married
and we're having a kid.


1399
01:20:58.009 --> 01:21:00.011
- Trust me, son, you're too weak.
- I'm not weak.


1400
01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:01.680
- Look...
- I'm not fucking weak.


1401
01:21:01.888 --> 01:21:04.516
You've grown up privileged
and spoiled and soft,


1402
01:21:04.724 --> 01:21:07.102
and now you're unconcerned
about other people's needs.


1403
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:08.728
What the fuck
are you talking about?


1404
01:21:08.937 --> 01:21:10.981
I do everything for you, Dad.

1405
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:14.443
I do everything for you. I make
your fucking tea, your fucking breakfast.


1406
01:21:14.651 --> 01:21:16.251
I make your fucking dinner
half the time.


1407
01:21:16.445 --> 01:21:17.863
I run your errands
all over town.


1408
01:21:18.071 --> 01:21:19.364
What more do you want from me?

1409
01:21:19.573 --> 01:21:21.825
Come on, seriously.

1410
01:21:22.033 --> 01:21:24.119
- She's unbalanced your mind.
- Fucking hell.


1411
01:21:24.327 --> 01:21:27.873
She's driven you crazy
and you're not making any sense.


1412
01:21:28.081 --> 01:21:30.500
One more word from you
about her, Dad...


1413
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:32.127
Just keep your beak out,
all right?


1414
01:21:32.335 --> 01:21:33.795
You want your mother and I
to go to prison?


1415
01:21:34.004 --> 01:21:36.423
- You want us to be murdered in our beds?
- No!


1416
01:21:36.631 --> 01:21:39.259
Look, listen to me.
She's got to go.


1417
01:21:39.468 --> 01:21:41.136
She's the rogue element.

1418
01:21:41.344 --> 01:21:45.015
You could have had the breakfast room
decorated by now.


1419
01:21:45.223 --> 01:21:47.863
Who are you siding with?
Your blood or some stranger you rocked up?


1420
01:21:47.893 --> 01:21:49.394
She's not just rocked up.

1421
01:21:49.603 --> 01:21:51.163
I've been going out
with her for a year.


1422
01:21:51.271 --> 01:21:52.647
She's carrying my child.

1423
01:21:52.856 --> 01:21:55.775
What fucking qualifications
does she need, Dad?


1424
01:21:55.984 --> 01:21:58.153
Oh, I see. You're thinking,
"Wait till the old ones


1425
01:21:58.361 --> 01:22:00.155
pop their clogs
and then get the house."


1426
01:22:00.363 --> 01:22:02.243
- Is that it?
- I don't want your fucking house!


1427
01:22:02.449 --> 01:22:05.169
I'd rather give it to a cats' home
than to you and that fucking slag.


1428
01:22:05.285 --> 01:22:06.786
I don't want your fucking house.

1429
01:22:06.995 --> 01:22:08.595
You'd betray your family
just to bring up


1430
01:22:08.747 --> 01:22:10.040
another man's bastard?

1431
01:22:10.248 --> 01:22:11.958
Don't talk to me about betrayal.

1432
01:22:12.167 --> 01:22:13.752
I know that Eric is dead.

1433
01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:16.296
And I know that you,
Eric and Garvey


1434
01:22:16.505 --> 01:22:18.673
- have been talking to the police.
- What?!


1435
01:22:18.882 --> 01:22:21.092
- Where'd all this come from?
- Berman told me.


1436
01:22:21.301 --> 01:22:23.261
- Death-bed confession, was it?
- As it turns out.


1437
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:24.846
He was addled with morphine.

1438
01:22:25.055 --> 01:22:26.695
Fucking hell, he was
chatting his bollocks


1439
01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:28.308
to anyone who came
into the room.


1440
01:22:28.517 --> 01:22:30.393
- Was he?
- Yes.


1441
01:22:30.602 --> 01:22:33.855
- Was he?
- Yes!


1442
01:22:34.064 --> 01:22:37.442
Look, you can just tell it
to me straight, Dad.


1443
01:22:37.651 --> 01:22:38.944
Just fucking be honest with me

1444
01:22:39.152 --> 01:22:41.988
for just...
for just a minute.


1445
01:22:42.197 --> 01:22:43.907
Just one minute.

1446
01:22:44.115 --> 01:22:47.536
Just fucking tell me
what's going on in there.


1447
01:22:50.163 --> 01:22:53.250
Oh, you can't
fucking do it, can you?


1448
01:22:53.458 --> 01:22:55.502
You fucking coward!

1449
01:22:58.588 --> 01:23:01.675
This is disappointing.

1450
01:23:01.883 --> 01:23:03.426
Take no notice of him.

1451
01:23:03.635 --> 01:23:05.762
He just says the first thing
that comes into his head.


1452
01:23:05.971 --> 01:23:08.974
How can you stand him?
He's a fucking nightmare.


1453
01:23:09.182 --> 01:23:11.768
- No, he's not a nightmare actually.
- He is a fucking nightmare.


1454
01:23:11.977 --> 01:23:12.947
Karl, calm down.

1455
01:23:12.972 --> 01:23:15.879
Mom, just fucking leave
me alone, all right?


1456
01:23:16.064 --> 01:23:18.441
It's not him, Karl.
It's you.


1457
01:23:18.650 --> 01:23:20.370
I mean, why don't you
just get a blood test?


1458
01:23:20.527 --> 01:23:23.488
And then if the baby's yours,
it could come and live here.


1459
01:23:23.697 --> 01:23:26.700
It'll be... it'll work out.
It'll be fine.


1460
01:23:28.285 --> 01:23:29.744
What about Valda?

1461
01:23:29.953 --> 01:23:32.914
Oh, Valda, darling...
she'll be like all the rest.


1462
01:23:33.123 --> 01:23:35.959
- She'll leave you.
- What are you talking about?


1463
01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:38.670
Oh God.

1464
01:23:38.878 --> 01:23:41.214
When you was little, right?

1465
01:23:41.423 --> 01:23:43.091
When you was born,

1466
01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:44.759
it was very different
then, Karl.


1467
01:23:44.968 --> 01:23:46.761
And they...

1468
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:49.222
you know, they couldn't help babies
out like they do now.


1469
01:23:49.431 --> 01:23:50.807
And there was something wrong...

1470
01:23:51.016 --> 01:23:52.726
something went wrong.
I don't know.


1471
01:23:52.934 --> 01:23:56.104
The incubator... oh, God knows
what went on really.


1472
01:23:56.313 --> 01:23:58.773
I'm sure that's why... all this business
about Eric...


1473
01:23:58.982 --> 01:24:00.582
Please stop. No, please stop.

1474
01:24:00.775 --> 01:24:04.112
All this business about Eric...
and you know your dad...


1475
01:24:04.321 --> 01:24:05.947
we had nothing to do with that.

1476
01:24:06.156 --> 01:24:09.159
You all are fakes.

1477
01:24:09.367 --> 01:24:12.412
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna tell you.


1478
01:24:12.621 --> 01:24:15.540
Come here, darling.
Come here.


1479
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.878
Come...

1480
01:24:20.086 --> 01:24:23.089
I'll tell you what.
I'll get you your pills, eh?


1481
01:24:24.215 --> 01:24:26.676
You need
a nice lie-down.

- You expecting someone?
- Yeah. It's Valda, Mom.


1512
01:27:12.634 --> 01:27:15.178
- I thought we were going into town?
- Yeah, I know.


1513
01:27:15.386 --> 01:27:17.972
- I thought maybe you could go with her instead.
- Why?


1514
01:27:18.181 --> 01:27:21.267
- Just talk to her a little bit.
- What about?


1515
01:27:21.476 --> 01:27:23.686
Well, she's just
freaking out, Mom.


1516

What, about the baby?

1517
01:27:26.064 --> 01:27:28.983
Yeah. Maybe you could
just settle her down a bit?


1518

1519
01:27:33.363 --> 01:27:35.490
Fine.

How are you feeling?

Feeling pretty good, actually.

Yeah, not for long.

- Oh, getting it out.


1524
01:27:44.457 --> 01:27:48.044
Boy, the pain.
You want someone to shoot you.

Nice bit of fresh air anyway.

1531
01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.358
Can you grab my cardie
out of the boot, please, Maggie?

Yeah.

Yeah? Gone where?

She's gone out with Valda.

- They're up on the downs.
- Oh.


1538
01:28:34.841 --> 01:28:37.427
I wonder if we're still
having sausages tonight then.


1539
01:28:38.887 --> 01:28:40.847
I don't know.

1540
01:28:41.055 --> 01:28:43.057
You all right, Karl?

1541
01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:58.323
Got a bit of a problem, Dad.

1542
01:28:58.531 --> 01:29:00.658
That sounds ominous.

1543
01:29:06.456 --> 01:29:08.499
It's like that, is it?

1544
01:29:10.293 --> 01:29:14.088
It's for the best...
for everyone.


1545
01:29:14.297 --> 01:29:17.383
Look, why don't you just have a cup of tea
with me and talk about it, Karl?


1546
01:29:17.592 --> 01:29:19.510
No, that's all right.

1547
01:29:19.719 --> 01:29:21.721
You have one.

1548
01:29:30.521 --> 01:29:32.690
Do you love me?
I love you.


1549
01:29:32.899 --> 01:29:37.236
I can't talk to you anymore.
You just confuse me.


1550
01:29:37.445 --> 01:29:39.697
What's your mother going to say?

1551
01:29:44.285 --> 01:29:47.455
She's gone already.

1552
01:29:47.664 --> 01:29:50.291
- What's happened?
- Dad, just sit down.


1553
01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:55.713
- Just sit down.
- Karl, where's Maggie?


1554
01:29:55.922 --> 01:29:58.800
- Karl, where is Maggie?
- Just sit down, Dad.


1555
01:30:59.902 --> 01:31:03.031
- Hello?
- We're in the breakfast room.

- Well, there he is.
- Yeah.

How did it go?

1558
01:31:20.256 --> 01:31:22.633
He was all right
with it, actually.


1559
01:31:24.343 --> 01:31:27.305
He was fucking
shattered, wasn't he?


1560
01:31:27.513 --> 01:31:29.515
He was knackered.
