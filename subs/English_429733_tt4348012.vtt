00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.599
Say hello to Idiosa Dartellum 7,

2
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.901
or the ID-7 virus.

3
00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:13.605
Nasty-looking
little fucker, huh?


4
00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:15.107
For the uninitiated,

5
00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.577
the ID-7 strain makes
stress hormone levels rise,


6
00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.380
blocks neural paths,
essentially attacking our ID


7
00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:23.448
and throwing off
a very important balance


8
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.084
in our brains...

9
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.720
The balance between
emotions and reason


10
00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:30.989
that keep us
from doing stupid shit,


11
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.925
thinks like punching
your Boss in the face when angry


12
00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.528
or fucking your date
in public when horny.


13
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.530
That balance
is temporarily severed,


14
00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:39.998
causing inhibitions to drop

15
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.401
and basic instincts
to rise to the surface


16
00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:43.735
as the infected fall victim

17
00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:46.972
to what experts call
emotional hijacking.


18
00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:49.808
Social media has tagged it
the red-eye virus


19
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.843
for obvious reasons.

20
00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.820
So in a nutshell,

21
00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:04.856
basic human dignity
takes a sick leave.


22
00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.858
The first reported case
of the red-eye virus


23
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.461
occurred 18 months ago
in des moines, Iowa,


24
00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:11.129
and quickly spread
around the world.


25
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.965
Since then, there have been
over 1,000 confirmed outbreaks


26
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.834
reported globally,
over half of which


27
00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:17.702
are in the United States alone.

28
00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:20.539
The CDC is optimistic they can
contain the virus immediately


29
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.040
through mandated quarantines,

30
00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:23.442
and the nation
will be virus-free


31
00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:24.843
by the end of the year

32
00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.711
as antibodies are being
aggressively tested.


33
00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:28.713
They also state the virus
isn't lethal,


34
00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:30.849
which is technically true.

35
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:35.954
But while the virus can't kill,
the infected, or redders, can.


36
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:40.125
Introducing Mr. nevil Reed,

37
00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:43.061
the first redder to be
officially cleared for murder.


38
00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:55.707
His legal defense alleged

39
00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.742
that those infected
with the ID-7 strain


40
00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.511
can't control their emotions

41
00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.746
and therefore are not liable
for the resulting actions.


42
00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.149
And thanks to a loophole,
the case was dismissed.


43
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.884
So nevil lost his shit,

44
00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.487
stabbed a co-worker repeatedly
in the face till dead


45
00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.889
and walked
thanks a doctor's note.


46
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:12.791
God bless the justice system.

47
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:25.003
Welcome to the home of
towers & Smythe consulting,


48
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.772
the Corporate scumbags hired
by the bigger Corporate scumbags


49
00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.774
in the landmark nevil Reed case.

50
00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:36.181
TSC is a firm fueled by greed,
duplicity, and moral decay,


51
00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:38.550
a place that ironically screens
their job applicants


52
00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.887
for honesty, loyalty,
and integrity.


53
00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:48.627
Qualities I had in spades
when I was fresh-faced


54
00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.162
and ready to take on the world
my first day here.


55
00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:53.665
And here's me
six months later...


56
00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:56.201
late nights,
no respect, the bad coffee,


57
00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:58.537
all the shit that comes
with paying your dues.


58
00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.305
But none of it
could slow me down.


59
00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:03.108
I was striving for the success
my family never had,


60
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.578
a seat at the big kids' table
with all the fixings,


61
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.114
all while paying back
those goddamn student loans.


62
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.320
But the higher I rose,

63
00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:18.557
the more I felt like I was
losing myself in the process.


64
00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.092
And after discovering that
loophole that won the Reed case,


65
00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.828
the requisite promotion
quickly followed.


66
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.096
But by then, it didn't matter

67
00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.831
that I thought
he was guilty as fuck.


68
00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.867
I just wanted the corner office.

69
00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:31.269
And for my sins,
they gave me one.


70
00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:35.308
What a dick.

71
00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.820
Towers and Smythe.

72
00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:13.945
I mean, how fucking stupid
can you get?


73
00:05:13.947 --> 00:05:15.680
- I'm sorry. I...
- oh, you're sorry?


74
00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.215
I don't fucking pay you
to be fucking sorry, Jenny.


75
00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.050
- Morning, hey. Morning, hey.
- Not now, Derek.


76
00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.352
Dude, you got to see this.
You got to see this.


77
00:05:20.354 --> 00:05:21.753
- Come over here.
- What's up?


78
00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:23.888
I just got this today.

79
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.626
Oh, man, last year's
Christmas party.


80
00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:29.861
That looks like you.

81
00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:34.366
Yeah. That's you.

82
00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:36.067
Where'd you get that?

83
00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.902
Oh, I googled
"a small-dick douche


84
00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:40.038
makes assistant work hard
for fake promise of a raise,"


85
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.075
and it was just, like, top
search result, like, number one.


86
00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:46.911
Listen, leave her alone
or I'll sell this to your wife


87
00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:50.115
for half of the half she'll get
from your divorce.


88
00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:51.816
It's a good talk, bro.

89
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.753
Thank you.

90
00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.126
May not be much...
Morning, miles.


91
00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:02.794
But I'll take whatever
goodwill I can pillage


92
00:06:02.796 --> 00:06:05.664
to sleep better at night.

93
00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:08.900
Thank god for coffee, right?

94
00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:10.669
Your 9:00 A. M. Is
in meeting room three.


95
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.171
- Where is my coffee cup?
- Don't know. Also, I...


96
00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:15.206
do you know who took it?

97
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.975
No.
But I can get you another one.


98
00:06:16.977 --> 00:06:20.011
I don't want another mug.
I want my mug.


99
00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:22.981
Yep, David from Vanda Corp.

100
00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:24.816
Derek. Derek.

101
00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:27.252
- What?
- David, line one.


102
00:06:27.254 --> 00:06:29.888
Okay. Put him on.

103
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.358
David, I was just
about to call you.


104
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.959
David?
Who the hell's David?


105
00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:36.394
It's Lucy.

106
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.863
Miles, this is my sister.

107
00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.198
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.100
It is so hard
to get you on the phone.


109
00:06:42.102 --> 00:06:43.334
I just wanted to see
if you were coming up


110
00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.469
for my birthday next month.

111
00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:46.071
Yeah. Um...

112
00:06:46.073 --> 00:06:48.807
No, actually.
I'm so sorry.


113
00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.475
I will not be able
to make it to your birthday.


114
00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:52.777
But I will totally
make it up to you.


115
00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.112
Well, if you're not
gonna show up,


116
00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:56.448
at least paint me
something cool.


117
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.949
How do you know
I started painting?


118
00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:59.350
Miles said you're pretty good.

119
00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:01.019
- Oh, did he?
- Yeah.


120
00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:03.121
You should sign up
for art classes or something.


121
00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:06.191
I don't have time
for art classes.


122
00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:08.727
Yeah. You don't have
time for anything.


123
00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:13.498
Yes. You are correct.

124
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.966
I do not have time for anything.

125
00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:16.768
I don't have time
for this conversation.


126
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.470
- But I love you very much.
- Wait, Derek. I just...


127
00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:20.105
- I wanted to talk to you more.
- Thank you so much for calling.


128
00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:21.306
I got to go.
I love you. Bye.


129
00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:34.119
What's my 9:00?

130
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:36.888
Good morning.
Pat Sorenson's office.


131
00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:42.160
- Right this way, sir.
- Great. Thanks.


132
00:08:17.898 --> 00:08:19.164
How can I help you?

133
00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:21.032
My client wants to pay
this overdue debt


134
00:08:21.034 --> 00:08:22.500
to reverse the foreclosure.

135
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.303
We just need TSC to tell
the bank to allow more time.


136
00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:26.971
I'm sorry to inform you,

137
00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:29.274
but our client has a strong
no-refinance policy.


138
00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:31.209
Then what do I tell mine?

139
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.077
Would you be open to
discussing the possibility


140
00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:34.512
of a deed in lieu?

141
00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:41.252
Mm. You don't know what
I'm talking about, do you?


142
00:08:41.254 --> 00:08:43.221
- You should see a lawyer.
- I am a lawyer.


143
00:08:43.223 --> 00:08:46.124
If you were a lawyer, you would
know what a deed in lieu is.


144
00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:49.360
You're one of the borrowers,
aren't you?


145
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.962
So what's a deed in lieu?

146
00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:52.230
It doesn't matter.

147
00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:53.531
Bank wouldn't agree
to it anyway.


148
00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.470
Look, you're not
the first borrower


149
00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:02.373
to try to pull
this kind of scam.


150
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:06.177
Miss, this is
a non-smoking room.


151
00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:08.046
So come stop me, suit.

152
00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:16.621
Wait.

153
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.626
We just need two more months.

154
00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:24.128
Families are involved here,
but nobody listens,


155
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.398
not the banks, not the lawyers.

156
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.034
I can't get past
their damn secretaries.


157
00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:33.004
Look, I am very sorry
this is happening to you.


158
00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:35.173
- Then don't kick me out.
- The bank is kicking you out.


159
00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:37.876
- The bank is your client.
- It's the firm's client.


160
00:09:37.878 --> 00:09:39.577
The firm's partners
call the shots.


161
00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:47.218
No one raindrop thinks
it caused the flood.


162
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.087
My mother used to say that.

163
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:54.459
Now I understand what it means.

164
00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:56.194
Is there anything else
I can do to help?


165
00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:57.562
You can start by telling me

166
00:09:57.564 --> 00:09:59.597
the partner calling
the shots on the case.


167
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.300
Sure. That would be...

168
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.242
Oh, shit.

169
00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:12.644
Irene Smythe.

170
00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.545
Well, I want a word
with this Irene Smythe


171
00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:16.381
or whoever right now.

172
00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:19.517
Sure. Let me get her
on the phone.


173
00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:26.658
- This way, ma'am.
- Get off me!


174
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.961
We're not done here!

175
00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:32.530
I'm gonna sue you!
I'm gonna sue all of you!


176
00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:35.066
Fuckers!

177
00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:43.041
You're in deep shit, too!

178
00:10:43.043 --> 00:10:46.477
You're in deep shit.

179
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.679
Brenda wasn't feeling well,

180
00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:49.647
so I had to go out
to the penthouse


181
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.249
to cover for her for a bit.

182
00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:52.583
Uh-huh.

183
00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.520
Turns out the Boss
is meeting with Kara,


184
00:10:55.522 --> 00:10:58.089
and I'm pretty sure
they were talking about


185
00:10:58.091 --> 00:11:00.959
you fucking up a Vanda Corp case
or something.


186
00:11:00.961 --> 00:11:03.728
Wait, what?
Are you...


187
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.998
I don't work Vanda Corp.
That's Kara's client.


188
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.066
I know, right?

189
00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:11.002
Oh, no.

190
00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:34.625
How can I help you?

191
00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:36.728
Derek Cho. Need an access code
to the eighth floor.


192
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.629
To see whom?

193
00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:42.000
Kara Powell,
Director of Operations,


194
00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:43.434
not effective
for client matters,


195
00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:44.769
but with all things related

196
00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:47.005
to navigating
internal company politics,


197
00:11:47.007 --> 00:11:49.273
she's fuckin' Mussolini.

198
00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:51.542
We call her the Siren.

199
00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:54.278
She's got the Boss's ear.

200
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.581
And her songs are sweet poison.

201
00:11:58.685 --> 00:12:02.420
Mr. Cho.

202
00:12:02.422 --> 00:12:03.554
Mr. Cho.

203
00:12:06.793 --> 00:12:10.128
To see... Kara Powell.

204
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.698
One moment, please.

205
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:19.070
Your pass code
is 7-8-5-star-9-5.


206
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.413
You expected me to create
a dedicated office mobile app


207
00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:29.580
with servers that run
on hamster wheels.


208
00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:31.716
Ray, stop talking.

209
00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:34.485
If I hear another
whining excuse from you,


210
00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:35.686
I'll make sure
you're back to building


211
00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.722
porn-site banner ads by lunch.

212
00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:39.457
Do you understand me?

213
00:12:39.459 --> 00:12:41.259
Yes, fine.

214
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:43.494
So stop playing
video games in your troll cave


215
00:12:43.496 --> 00:12:47.265
and get the interoffice apps
updated asap, okay, sweetie?


216
00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.200
Okay. Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.


217
00:12:49.202 --> 00:12:51.369
Asshole.

218
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.738
- What I can do for you?
- That's a nice mug.


219
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.206
Where'd you get it?

220
00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:57.442
I told my assistant
to get me one.


221
00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:58.676
And where did she get it?

222
00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:00.445
Meg!

223
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:04.115
Derek here wants to know
where you got the mug.


224
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:06.117
From a kitchen downstairs.

225
00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:09.087
Okay. And why did you
choose that one?


226
00:13:09.089 --> 00:13:10.555
Because the other ones
were filthy.


227
00:13:10.557 --> 00:13:12.256
And why do you think
this one wasn't?


228
00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:14.125
Because the maid cleaned it.

229
00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:17.762
Incorrect. I cleaned this
mug because this mug is mine.


230
00:13:17.764 --> 00:13:19.530
And what's mine is mine.

231
00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.532
And what's yours is yours.

232
00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:23.167
You're getting to a point.

233
00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:24.769
Vanda Corp is your client.

234
00:13:24.771 --> 00:13:26.671
That blood's on your hands.

235
00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:28.806
Oh. Oh, so now
you want to share.


236
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:31.409
I can't share what isn't mine.

237
00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:33.811
Vanda Corp has filed
more than 100 account cases


238
00:13:33.813 --> 00:13:35.480
through us
in the last two years.


239
00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:37.415
Well, then I hope they have
a good case manager.


240
00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:39.450
<i>You mean managers.</i>

241
00:13:39.452 --> 00:13:42.420
No one can work a client
that big without delegating.


242
00:13:42.422 --> 00:13:44.856
And according to the annual
work distribution sheet...


243
00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:47.492
That hasn't been
updated in years.


244
00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:51.395
One of Vanda Corp's complaint
cases was assigned...


245
00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:55.500
to you.

246
00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.335
File 45a.

247
00:13:59.739 --> 00:14:02.140
I'm being set up.

248
00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:09.814
Wow.
Heads will roll.


249
00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:11.749
This will cost Vanda...

250
00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:13.284
give me this.

251
00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.823
- This was planted.
- I'll cut you a deal.


252
00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:20.725
- Plead guilty.
- Not guilty.


253
00:14:20.727 --> 00:14:22.793
The Corpse was found
inside your office.


254
00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:25.296
You knew exactly
where to find it.


255
00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:26.731
Do you want to
take this upstairs?


256
00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:29.800
Great idea.
Take your file.


257
00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:33.905
<i>Want to swipe your key card,</i>

258
00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:35.573
or should I swipe mine?

259
00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:38.843
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot.


260
00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:40.678
You don't have clearance.

261
00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:46.417
My bad.

262
00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:48.419
Don't you worry, little one.

263
00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:50.321
Daddy will pay
for abandoning you


264
00:14:50.323 --> 00:14:53.257
and leaving you to die
in that cold, dirty dumpster.


265
00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:55.293
No, no.
You died when you drowned


266
00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:56.761
because mommy left you
in the bathtub


267
00:14:56.763 --> 00:14:58.763
while she went shopping
for shoes.


268
00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:01.766
But don't worry.
Daddy will make her pay.


269
00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:03.968
Too bad mommy outranks daddy.

270
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.703
Mommy's a backstabbing bitch.

271
00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:07.672
That's why mommy outranks daddy.

272
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.376
- Brenda, what's his mood?
- He's drawing.


273
00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:14.679
Oh, shit.

274
00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:18.883
John towers, capital "t" in TSC,
king of the castle,


275
00:15:18.885 --> 00:15:21.953
top of the food chain,
and total fucking maniac...


276
00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:25.323
you know, your typical
American success story.


277
00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:27.992
Did I mention that he also
dabbles in the fine arts?


278
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.498
Tell me what you see here.

279
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.002
I see that those soldiers'
lives are in danger, sir.


280
00:15:38.004 --> 00:15:39.503
Do you think they'll make it?

281
00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:40.972
No, sir.
The fuse is too short.


282
00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:42.707
It's too late to run.

283
00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.508
And what do you think
they should be doing instead?


284
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.743
May I, sir?

285
00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:46.877
Hmm.

286
00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:58.723
So simple and yet so effective.

287
00:15:58.725 --> 00:16:00.258
Can you see it, Derek?

288
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.793
Can you see the solution
to our problem here?


289
00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:05.396
<i>I think you mean her problem
because she was the one that...</i>


290
00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:07.765
give me the file.

291
00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:10.001
This is our bomb.

292
00:16:10.003 --> 00:16:12.503
The fuse is already burning.

293
00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:15.673
So should we run
like cowards and die?


294
00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:17.575
We are brave, sir.

295
00:16:17.577 --> 00:16:21.279
I'm so glad you said that,
because any second now,


296
00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:23.648
Vanda Corp is gonna
find out about this mess,


297
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.484
and I'm gonna need some scalps.

298
00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.553
So, who dropped the ball?

299
00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:31.922
I hate pointing fingers,
but may I suggest


300
00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:34.892
you check the annual
work distribution sheet?


301
00:16:34.894 --> 00:16:38.562
Someone cooked
the fucking worksheet.


302
00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.531
Sir.

303
00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:42.733
Go on.

304
00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:45.836
Have you noticed that whenever
there's a problem like this,


305
00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:50.675
it's almost always
the same soldier involved?


306
00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:54.845
Because down in the trenches,
we have all noticed.


307
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:58.549
And we wonder if discharging
this problem soldier


308
00:16:58.551 --> 00:17:01.319
might be the solution
to preventing this kind of mess


309
00:17:01.321 --> 00:17:04.088
from ever happening again.

310
00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:05.723
And who would that be?

311
00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:06.891
May I?

312
00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:27.011
Thank you, Derek.
You can leave.


313
00:17:27.013 --> 00:17:28.579
Let's discuss.

314
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:29.680
Yes, sir.

315
00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:31.415
- I...
- leave.


316
00:17:48.034 --> 00:17:49.633
You got a sec?

317
00:17:55.108 --> 00:18:02.780
Ahhh-ummmm.

318
00:18:05.852 --> 00:18:08.519
Nothing like a little
power meditation.


319
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:12.456
This one's new.
Declan's walking already?


320
00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:17.395
Wobbling, actually, like you
were last Friday night.


321
00:18:17.397 --> 00:18:18.796
Thanks for the ride, by the way.

322
00:18:18.798 --> 00:18:20.731
Thanks for puking in my car.

323
00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:22.733
That's what friends are for.

324
00:18:22.735 --> 00:18:25.936
So debrief me.
What happened?


325
00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:28.839
Just found someone else's shit
swept under my carpet.


326
00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:30.708
What kind of shit?

327
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.910
Vanda Corp shit.

328
00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:35.146
It's a seven-figure mistake.
I didn't even touch the file.


329
00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:37.548
Ah, don't sweat it.

330
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.150
Those clowns working Vanda Corp

331
00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:41.852
are a bunch of
a serial screw-ups.


332
00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.422
Look, I realize you might
not want to divulge...


333
00:18:44.424 --> 00:18:47.758
the Siren.

334
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.029
All right. Let's take
a beat to strategize.


335
00:18:52.031 --> 00:18:54.131
Since the promotion,
you could possibly


336
00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.966
be in charge of a case that big

337
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.836
but not big enough
to be untouchable.


338
00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:01.839
That's why she chose you.
You're the perfect fall guy.


339
00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:05.810
So before even taking
this upstairs...


340
00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:09.947
you already took this upstairs
and made a mess of things.


341
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:13.117
Fuck.

342
00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:15.986
Say I punch a rhino in the face.

343
00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:18.923
Would you call that
brave or stupid?


344
00:19:18.925 --> 00:19:20.724
Brave...

345
00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:22.760
And stupid.

346
00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:25.729
See how bravery and stupidity
can overlap?


347
00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:28.132
Now that you understand that,
let me give her a call


348
00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:30.734
and see if I can't find a way
to cut you a deal.


349
00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.636
She already offered me a deal.

350
00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:36.574
I told her to suck it
and that this is war.


351
00:19:36.576 --> 00:19:37.842
War is over, moron.

352
00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:40.611
- Come on in, Kara.
- How so?


353
00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:43.647
Natural selection happened.
Pack your shit.


354
00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:46.884
- Boxes are on the second floor.
- You're fucking kidding me.


355
00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:49.086
Derek, calm down.

356
00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:51.021
You blew him, didn't you?

357
00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:53.924
Like I need to stoop
to that level.


358
00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:59.163
Now... Get the fuck
out of my face.


359
00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:01.098
I'm taking this to the nine.

360
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.702
Sure.
Good luck with that.


361
00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.704
And I want my mug back.

362
00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:12.109
The nine, the company's
Board of Directors.


363
00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:15.813
Good morning, everybody.
This is the Vanda Corp file.


364
00:20:15.815 --> 00:20:18.148
No one here goes up
or down without their vote.


365
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.584
Rumor has it that they're
actually cybernetic organisms,


366
00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.920
but that hasn't been
officially confirmed yet.


367
00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:24.655
Now, there's
a common misconception


368
00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:26.857
about the death gesture
during gladiatorial combat.


369
00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:28.792
The actual phrase
used in Roman texts


370
00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:30.928
doesn't translate
as thumbs down,


371
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.530
but rather thumbs turned.

372
00:20:32.532 --> 00:20:33.831
Personally, I think
we should hang,


373
00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:36.100
draw and quarter
the little fucker.


374
00:20:36.102 --> 00:20:40.237
But, you know, that's just me.
So let's vote.


375
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.672
That's because the Victors

376
00:20:41.674 --> 00:20:42.973
finished off their opponents

377
00:20:42.975 --> 00:20:44.808
with a sword thrust
across the throat.


378
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.913
So it's unanimous.
Call Lester.


379
00:20:48.915 --> 00:20:52.316
Enter Lester mcgill,
head of human resources.


380
00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:55.119
No, not her.
That guy.


381
00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:00.958
He takes care
of the firm's layoffs.


382
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.230
He's as cold as his methods are
efficient, a perfect fit here.


383
00:21:06.232 --> 00:21:09.867
Naturally,
we call him the reaper,


384
00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:11.168
and he's the last person

385
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.704
you want to see standing
at your doorway.


386
00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:19.209
Mind if I come in... Derek?

387
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:21.078
If I said no?

388
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.180
Thank you.

389
00:21:28.353 --> 00:21:31.255
D- do you even know
what happened?


390
00:21:31.257 --> 00:21:32.990
I don't care what happened.

391
00:21:32.992 --> 00:21:35.659
You must be good friends
with Kara, then.


392
00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:39.730
I hope she dies promptly.

393
00:21:39.732 --> 00:21:41.198
Glad we're on the same page.

394
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.169
Um, the nine listen to you,
and I have proof that...


395
00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:46.737
- Sign here...
- This was not my mist...


396
00:21:46.739 --> 00:21:48.105
and here.

397
00:21:48.107 --> 00:21:50.741
What the hell are you doing?

398
00:21:50.743 --> 00:21:52.676
My job.

399
00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.345
So you are on her side.

400
00:21:54.347 --> 00:21:58.048
I'm on the right side.
Always am.


401
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.217
<i>That's why it's me firing you.</i>

402
00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:03.153
Fuck you.

403
00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:07.358
Sign these documents
from upstairs


404
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.227
so I can clear accounting
to transfer your severance pay


405
00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:12.096
into your account.

406
00:22:18.136 --> 00:22:20.070
Do you know what this is?

407
00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:21.839
This is a statement saying

408
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:24.341
that I take full responsibility
over the Vanda Corp mess.


409
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.911
I'll have to file that
under "n" for "not my problem."


410
00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:30.114
I could be disbarred.

411
00:22:30.116 --> 00:22:32.316
I could face legal action
from the client.


412
00:22:32.318 --> 00:22:34.184
I'm just the messenger, Derek.

413
00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:37.421
Yelling at me is like yelling at
your watch because you're late.


414
00:22:37.423 --> 00:22:39.390
Why would I sign this crap?

415
00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:43.894
To get rich.

416
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:48.899
Wow.

417
00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:52.136
Glad to see we're now
on the same page.


418
00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:58.676
Glad to see I'm not.

419
00:22:58.678 --> 00:23:00.844
You want to do this
the hard way?


420
00:23:00.846 --> 00:23:03.747
<i>I want to do this the right way.</i>

421
00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:06.150
I want to speak with him
and the nine.


422
00:23:06.152 --> 00:23:08.686
Executive decisions are
not subject to appeal.


423
00:23:08.688 --> 00:23:10.821
This one fucking better be

424
00:23:10.823 --> 00:23:13.824
because I'm not leaving this
building until I plead my case.


425
00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:14.858
Understood.

426
00:23:56.736 --> 00:23:58.302
This building
is under quarantine.


427
00:23:58.304 --> 00:23:59.803
Get back inside.

428
00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.244
What's going on here?

429
00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:41.779
You can't tell me...

430
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:44.114
- What the...
- Hell is going on?


431
00:24:44.116 --> 00:24:45.349
One of our pathogen sniffers

432
00:24:45.351 --> 00:24:47.050
in the building's
ventilation system


433
00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:49.186
picked up traces
of the ID-7 virus.


434
00:24:49.188 --> 00:24:50.554
And who authorized you

435
00:24:50.556 --> 00:24:52.523
to install a sniffer
in my building anyway?


436
00:24:52.525 --> 00:24:54.191
Since the outbreak
in des moines,


437
00:24:54.193 --> 00:24:56.460
detection devices
are now legally required


438
00:24:56.462 --> 00:24:57.861
in public places.

439
00:24:57.863 --> 00:24:59.830
Des moines. Fuck.

440
00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:01.198
According to our projections,

441
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.933
those infected in the building

442
00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:07.504
will begin to display
symptoms soon, if not already.


443
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:10.040
Our experts have already
released a neutralizer


444
00:25:10.042 --> 00:25:11.809
into your ventilation system.

445
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:14.011
All traces of the virus
should be eliminated


446
00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:15.946
in approximately eight hours.

447
00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:18.849
Until then, this building
is officially under quarantine.


448
00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:21.084
So what are we supposed to do
for the next eight hours?


449
00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:23.854
Try to remain calm.

450
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:25.956
So there I was getting
the shit kicked out of me


451
00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:28.025
on the lobby floor
by this asshole.


452
00:25:28.027 --> 00:25:34.164
And then... Something... Happened!

453
00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:36.366
- Aah!
- I don't want to remain calm!


454
00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:37.901
I want this fixed.

455
00:25:41.307 --> 00:25:43.540
Hey. It's me. It's me.

456
00:25:43.542 --> 00:25:45.542
- You all right?
- I think I just...


457
00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:47.244
I think I just punched
a rhino in the face.


458
00:25:47.246 --> 00:25:49.012
- What?
- He attacked me.


459
00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:51.248
And then I-i
just kicked his ass.


460
00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.050
Whoo!

461
00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:54.384
I'm going to go talk
to the nine.


462
00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:55.352
- No.
- Yeah.


463
00:25:55.354 --> 00:25:56.987
Fuck this place!

464
00:25:56.989 --> 00:25:59.122
This mess is a blessing
in disguise, trust me.


465
00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:00.924
You don't want
to end up like me.


466
00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:02.626
What are you talking about?
You have everything figured out!


467
00:26:02.628 --> 00:26:04.261
No, Derek.

468
00:26:04.263 --> 00:26:06.363
This... this... this meditation
and this incense,


469
00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:08.198
it's all Bullshit.

470
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.967
You think I like
the taste of Kale?


471
00:26:09.969 --> 00:26:12.870
Come on!
I'm fuckin' dead inside.


472
00:26:12.872 --> 00:26:15.639
But they have me wrong.
I have to tell them.


473
00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:18.275
Do you have any idea
what they're capable of?


474
00:26:18.277 --> 00:26:20.310
Just... just... just hide out
in your office


475
00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:21.879
until the virus subsides,

476
00:26:21.881 --> 00:26:24.348
then walk out those doors
and don't look back.


477
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.017
Free as a bird.

478
00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:28.285
All right?

479
00:26:28.287 --> 00:26:29.519
- Okay.
- Okay.


480
00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:31.955
- Okay.
- Now come on.


481
00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:33.991
Put some peanut butter
in your wheatgrass shot.


482
00:26:33.993 --> 00:26:35.259
What do you say?

483
00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:43.901
Motherfucker!

484
00:26:43.903 --> 00:26:46.336
Until the quarantine is over,
we'll need your cooperation


485
00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:48.572
to keep the situation
under control.


486
00:26:48.574 --> 00:26:51.541
We know better than anyone else
that this virus


487
00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:54.645
turns people into maniacs
or blathering idiots.


488
00:26:54.647 --> 00:26:56.313
As you may know,

489
00:26:56.315 --> 00:26:58.582
the virus triggers
a breakdown of moral barriers,


490
00:26:58.584 --> 00:27:01.084
unleashing repressed emotions
in the infected,


491
00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:04.655
including anger,
depression, fear, lust.


492
00:27:04.657 --> 00:27:06.223
Like cocaine?

493
00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:08.525
An infected individual
would make a coke addict


494
00:27:08.527 --> 00:27:10.594
look like a model citizen
by comparison.


495
00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:12.963
But we still feel normal.

496
00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:15.699
The virus can cause
drastic mood swings


497
00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:19.069
with potentially violent
and severe consequences.


498
00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:21.972
It would be best if stressful
work-related situations


499
00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.206
were avoided.

500
00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:24.408
Yeah.
I'm going to come to your house,


501
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.109
and I'm going to
fucking kill you!


502
00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:27.344
Bye, mom.

503
00:27:27.346 --> 00:27:29.446
Antidepressants, stimulants,

504
00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:32.683
even caffeine can accelerate
the virus's effect.


505
00:27:32.685 --> 00:27:35.986
Meg, make more fucking coffee!

506
00:27:43.228 --> 00:27:49.366
So, what happens
when 287 employees


507
00:27:49.368 --> 00:27:54.438
with average billing rates
of $200 an hour


508
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.575
stop working for eight hours?

509
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280
You don't know?

510
00:28:07.418 --> 00:28:10.654
I lose half a million dollars!

511
00:28:10.656 --> 00:28:14.057
Now, crack your whips.
Everybody goes back to work.


512
00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:17.394
And if they don't like it,
they are terminated immediately


513
00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:18.996
and no severance packages.

514
00:28:18.998 --> 00:28:20.464
Put the fear of me in them.

515
00:28:20.466 --> 00:28:22.366
What now?

516
00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:24.668
Derek Cho wants clearance
to come up.


517
00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.204
- What for?
- He said he reconsidered,


518
00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:30.273
but he wants to have a word
with you and the nine first.


519
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:37.681
Your pass code
is 8-star-1-9-9, fuck-head.


520
00:28:43.756 --> 00:28:46.423
Fuck you!

521
00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:49.359
No, no.

522
00:28:49.361 --> 00:28:50.494
No, up.

523
00:28:50.496 --> 00:28:52.429
Up. Up.

524
00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:54.798
Let me the fuck up!

525
00:28:57.603 --> 00:29:00.203
Ohh!

526
00:29:00.205 --> 00:29:06.610
Colton snyder, aka the Bull,
the Boss' unofficial left hook.


527
00:29:08.714 --> 00:29:11.181
Nobody knows his exact
job description.


528
00:29:11.183 --> 00:29:13.483
But whenever there's a hint
of something dirty going on...


529
00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:16.053
- Take his phone.
- There he is.


530
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.632
Hello, Derek.

531
00:29:28.634 --> 00:29:30.267
Uh, look, I am so sorry

532
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:31.768
we didn't get a chance
to meet again.


533
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:35.272
Uh, things came up.
You know how it is.


534
00:29:35.274 --> 00:29:37.441
Now, I know what
you're thinking...


535
00:29:37.443 --> 00:29:39.309
"nevil Reed,
he got away with murder.


536
00:29:39.311 --> 00:29:41.511
Maybe I can have
a little fun here."


537
00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:46.283
Did you really think that
I didn't see that coming?


538
00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:49.519
Actually, I was just gonna
ask for my job back.


539
00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:52.389
But I like your idea, too.

540
00:29:52.391 --> 00:29:55.692
Well, I'm going to
beat you to the punch.


541
00:29:55.694 --> 00:29:59.362
Oh, ow.
Now, that sounds like it hurt.


542
00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:01.765
- Is he hurt?
- Yes, sir.


543
00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:03.834
Is he crying?

544
00:30:03.836 --> 00:30:05.469
No, sir.

545
00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:07.704
Well, why isn't he
fucking crying?!


546
00:30:14.613 --> 00:30:17.380
He is now, sir.

547
00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:19.249
Now, I want to hear
a bone break.


548
00:30:19.251 --> 00:30:21.518
They say the femur is the most
difficult bone in the body


549
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.187
to break,
but I'll settle for a pinkie.


550
00:30:25.357 --> 00:30:27.157
I'm coming, Derek.

551
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:34.498
What's happening?

552
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.899
Motherfuckers!

553
00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:47.811
Can someone tell me what
the fuck is going on in there?


554
00:30:58.524 --> 00:31:00.190
Ewan?

555
00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:08.231
I... Smell...

556
00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.799
Toast.

557
00:31:13.405 --> 00:31:14.804
Ewan.

558
00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:16.373
Ewan!

559
00:31:16.375 --> 00:31:17.707
- Ewan!
- Ewan?


560
00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.709
Ewan!

561
00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:21.178
You killed Ewan?

562
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.713
There's been an accident.

563
00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:26.449
Do you have any idea
how many billable hours


564
00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:28.518
I'm gonna lose
until I find a replacement?


565
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.820
I'm worried about
the body right now.


566
00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:33.223
- I killed him.
- You didn't kill him.


567
00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:36.193
The virus killed him.
You're infected.


568
00:31:36.195 --> 00:31:37.627
You have impunity!

569
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:40.630
We have a precedent
in nevil Reed.


570
00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:42.199
You can thank Derek for that.

571
00:31:42.201 --> 00:31:44.201
- Motherfucker.
- Thank you for that, Derek.


572
00:31:45.537 --> 00:31:46.836
Lock him up with the other one

573
00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:48.672
and then get back up here.

574
00:32:37.623 --> 00:32:39.723
Ah!

575
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.997
What are you doing here?!

576
00:32:46.999 --> 00:32:48.465
They fired me.

577
00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:50.300
That's nice.

578
00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:52.269
Justice is served for once.

579
00:32:52.271 --> 00:32:53.536
What are you doing here?

580
00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.338
Security called the cops,

581
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.307
but this place was quarantined
before they could show up,


582
00:32:57.309 --> 00:32:59.676
so they threw me
in this hellhole.


583
00:32:59.678 --> 00:33:02.279
I'm suing everyone
and their grandmother


584
00:33:02.281 --> 00:33:03.913
when I get out of here,
I swear to god.


585
00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:06.716
Good luck.
It's ID-7!


586
00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:08.551
No one's liable for
anything that they do.


587
00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:12.022
Just like any other day for you.

588
00:33:12.024 --> 00:33:15.492
Yeah, we're not liable
for what we do in here, either.


589
00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:16.926
Nice, then I'll have your balls
for dinner


590
00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.561
for that shit you pulled!

591
00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:20.030
Wait! Wait! Wait!

592
00:33:20.032 --> 00:33:21.631
This might sound crazy,

593
00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:22.866
but I think we can help
each other out here.


594
00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:25.368
Okay?
You remember Irene Smythe,


595
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.704
the woman that
fucking screwed you?


596
00:33:27.706 --> 00:33:30.307
She's in the building's
penthouse right now.


597
00:33:30.309 --> 00:33:31.775
So what?

598
00:33:31.777 --> 00:33:37.314
You help me get to the top,
and she's all yours.


599
00:33:37.316 --> 00:33:40.317
This is our shot to hold
these assholes accountable


600
00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:43.019
for all the fucking damage
that they've done!


601
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:46.923
And our chance goes away as soon
as this quarantine is over.


602
00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:48.992
Yeah?

603
00:33:48.994 --> 00:33:50.593
Can I get up now?

604
00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:53.396
Are you going to stop
being an asshole?


605
00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:54.664
That's debatable.

606
00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:57.701
Ah, yes. Yes.

607
00:33:57.703 --> 00:33:59.769
Oh.

608
00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:06.976
Oh.

609
00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:17.554
What are you looking for?

610
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:18.988
A loophole.

611
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.692
It's my specialty.

612
00:34:22.694 --> 00:34:24.127
Yeah!

613
00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:29.532
I don't think they'd lock us up
in a room with working phones.


614
00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:30.800
I don't need a working phone.

615
00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:33.770
Just need bit of this,
a bit of that.


616
00:34:33.772 --> 00:34:35.372
Build a franken-phone.

617
00:34:35.374 --> 00:34:37.674
And call who?
Cops can't enter the building.


618
00:34:37.676 --> 00:34:39.642
I'm not calling the cops.

619
00:34:39.644 --> 00:34:43.012
Uh, sir?
Um, Derek Cho somehow managed


620
00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:46.049
to set up a call
with Vander Corp's CEO,


621
00:34:46.051 --> 00:34:47.584
and they wanted you to join in.

622
00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:51.054
Ahh.

623
00:34:51.056 --> 00:34:52.422
In a minute.

624
00:34:53.759 --> 00:34:55.592
Sorry to keep you waiting,
frank.


625
00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:56.960
I'm all ears!

626
00:34:56.962 --> 00:34:59.396
Ah, glad you could join us,
John.


627
00:34:59.398 --> 00:35:01.731
Well, I've been having
a nice, long chat


628
00:35:01.733 --> 00:35:03.099
with one of your lawyers.

629
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.167
You still there, Derek?

630
00:35:04.169 --> 00:35:06.736
Yes, uh, sir. I am still here.

631
00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:10.140
Good.
John, can you please remind me?


632
00:35:10.142 --> 00:35:12.776
Why do I do business with TSC?

633
00:35:12.778 --> 00:35:15.178
Well, because it's
a jungle out there, frank.


634
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.547
And not only
do you need a guide,


635
00:35:17.549 --> 00:35:20.083
but you also need a lion
walking right by your side.


636
00:35:20.085 --> 00:35:23.653
And we are your lion
and your guide.


637
00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:24.821
- Are you?
- Yeah.


638
00:35:24.823 --> 00:35:26.623
Well, we're just
a touch concerned


639
00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:30.994
that you may have
ulterior motives.


640
00:35:30.996 --> 00:35:33.930
We would never turn
against our clients, frank.


641
00:35:33.932 --> 00:35:35.498
Well, that may be true,

642
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.835
but Derek has alerted me
to a certain document


643
00:35:38.837 --> 00:35:42.172
that seems to suggest otherwise.

644
00:35:42.174 --> 00:35:45.208
It's a report that, uh,
TSC did for Vander Corp.


645
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.776
It analyzes the advisability

646
00:35:46.778 --> 00:35:48.678
of filing a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit


647
00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.914
against one of frank's
ex-business associates.


648
00:35:50.916 --> 00:35:53.516
Do you remember
this report, John?


649
00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:54.784
No.

650
00:35:54.786 --> 00:35:57.454
I must say, it's well-written.

651
00:35:57.456 --> 00:36:01.458
I like how it weighs
the slim possibility


652
00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.860
of a positive financial outcome

653
00:36:03.862 --> 00:36:08.698
against the enormous
potential litigation costs.


654
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.167
Do you agree
with this report, Derek?


655
00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:13.536
Uh, no, sir.
I do not.


656
00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:15.472
I believe you could
have won the suit.


657
00:36:15.474 --> 00:36:19.042
Then why did your advisers
advise me against it?


658
00:36:19.044 --> 00:36:22.679
Your advisers missed
the deadline to file the motion.


659
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:26.115
So you believe that TSC
dropped the ball on this one?


660
00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:28.485
Uh, I believe they
dropped the ball, sir.


661
00:36:28.487 --> 00:36:31.621
Uh, but then they also
defecated on the ball


662
00:36:31.623 --> 00:36:34.958
and then sodomized
the ball, sir.


663
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.760
Hmm. Interesting.

664
00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:39.662
Oh, and, John,

665
00:36:39.664 --> 00:36:43.566
I just happen to have
your last invoice here with me.


666
00:36:48.939 --> 00:36:51.541
Oh.

667
00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:52.775
That went well.

668
00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:58.515
I want you to rip the fucking
phone out of his hands,


669
00:36:58.517 --> 00:37:01.618
his hands
off his fucking body now!


670
00:37:07.526 --> 00:37:10.193
Uh, yeah. Can I please order
two pepperoni pizzas


671
00:37:10.195 --> 00:37:12.028
and some, uh, hot wings?

672
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.664
Yeah. Why not? Throw some, uh,
garlic bread in there.


673
00:37:14.666 --> 00:37:16.633
Do you guys want anything?

674
00:37:37.556 --> 00:37:40.590
Brenda!
This fucking phone doesn't work!


675
00:37:50.035 --> 00:37:52.335
Yeah.

676
00:37:52.337 --> 00:37:55.939
Christ, man!
He fuck your girl, too?


677
00:37:57.908 --> 00:38:00.910
Damn, suit, you don't even
respect each other.


678
00:38:00.912 --> 00:38:04.013
You're right.

679
00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:05.348
We don't.

680
00:38:07.986 --> 00:38:10.019
Now what?

681
00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.330
Time to go to work.

682
00:38:42.754 --> 00:38:45.288
- Fuck, yeah!
- Oh, shit.


683
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.024
They started a countdown
for the quarantine,


684
00:38:48.026 --> 00:38:49.392
posted in an interoffice app.

685
00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:50.893
Well, it's enough time
to get the job done.


686
00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:52.195
I mean, this place
isn't that big.


687
00:38:52.197 --> 00:38:54.330
Ah, the Boss is a
fucking raging cokehead.


688
00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:55.932
There's definitely
gonna be more guards.


689
00:38:55.934 --> 00:38:57.634
Fine.
I'll bring more nails.


690
00:38:57.636 --> 00:38:59.035
The only way to the top floor
is with the key card


691
00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:00.670
or a one-time password.

692
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:02.805
So who do we have to
fuck up to get the card?


693
00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:05.708
Okay. First, there's an ass-hat
on the sixth floor


694
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.744
who's got a level-two key card.

695
00:39:07.746 --> 00:39:09.045
It can take us
to the seventh floor,


696
00:39:09.047 --> 00:39:10.313
giving us access to the bitch

697
00:39:10.315 --> 00:39:12.148
who's got
a level-three key card.


698
00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:23.760
Hey, extreme measures, right?

699
00:40:01.032 --> 00:40:02.832
- Wednesdays.
- Hey!


700
00:40:06.104 --> 00:40:07.437
Him?

701
00:40:07.439 --> 00:40:09.338
Yep.

702
00:40:16.314 --> 00:40:17.847
Hey!

703
00:40:24.022 --> 00:40:25.388
Open the fucking door!

704
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.256
Fuck you, motherfucker!

705
00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:29.859
You open doors like
my grandmother fucks!


706
00:40:29.861 --> 00:40:31.094
Open the door!

707
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.800
Open the fucking door!

708
00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:39.769
Open the door!

709
00:40:57.956 --> 00:40:59.322
Shh!

710
00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.126
Aah!

711
00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:26.783
It really bothers me that women

712
00:41:26.785 --> 00:41:29.786
don't get the same treatment
as men in the workplace.


713
00:41:29.788 --> 00:41:31.220
Aaaah!

714
00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:34.957
I'm all about
gender equality here.


715
00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:38.094
Aaaah!

716
00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:39.262
Derek!

717
00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:45.968
Aah!

718
00:41:47.105 --> 00:41:49.438
Aah!

719
00:42:14.933 --> 00:42:17.500
- Need a hand?
- I don't need your help, suit.


720
00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:19.335
But I need yours.

721
00:42:19.337 --> 00:42:20.536
Fuck you.

722
00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:22.038
Fuck you, too.

723
00:42:27.312 --> 00:42:30.112
- May we come in?
- And if I said no?


724
00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:32.615
You'll have to confer
with my associate.


725
00:42:32.617 --> 00:42:35.051
And mine, gimpy.

726
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.392
- What do you want?
- Key card.


727
00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:45.995
I'm not the only one
with a level-two key card.


728
00:42:45.997 --> 00:42:49.866
But you are the one
that fired me, asshole!


729
00:42:49.868 --> 00:42:54.170
Wrong. The firm fired you.
Don't nail-gun the messenger.


730
00:42:54.172 --> 00:42:56.472
Oh.

731
00:42:56.474 --> 00:42:58.941
Oh, my god.

732
00:42:58.943 --> 00:43:01.544
You bring up a very good point.

733
00:43:01.546 --> 00:43:04.146
I'm so sorry, Lester.
We're good.


734
00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:06.082
We're... we're...
we're totally good, man.


735
00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:08.918
Um, I will take it up
with the firm,


736
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.622
but I would love to know
where I could find the firm,


737
00:43:12.624 --> 00:43:17.126
because I would love
to kick the firm's ass.


738
00:43:17.128 --> 00:43:20.396
You can't kick a firm's ass.

739
00:43:20.398 --> 00:43:22.031
That's the point.

740
00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:29.005
Oh. Well, then that
brings us back to you.


741
00:43:29.007 --> 00:43:31.040
I was just doing my job.

742
00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.378
No one raindrop thinks
it caused the flood.


743
00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.280
I get what that means.

744
00:43:37.282 --> 00:43:40.316
You know what will happen to me
if I give you this key card?


745
00:43:40.318 --> 00:43:44.086
I'm going to have to
file that under "n"


746
00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:46.322
for "not my fucking problem."

747
00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:57.967
Fuck!

748
00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:08.210
No! The saw!

749
00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:10.179
Extreme measures!

750
00:44:10.181 --> 00:44:12.214
Go!

751
00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.186
Whoo!

752
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:29.365
Ow!

753
00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:30.666
A little help?

754
00:44:41.112 --> 00:44:43.179
- You ready?
- Ah! Ah!


755
00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:45.514
It's gonna hurt a lot.

756
00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.516
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?


757
00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:50.286
- You're still one of them.
- I thought we were a team.


758
00:44:50.288 --> 00:44:52.121
For the time being.

759
00:44:52.123 --> 00:44:53.389
All right. On the count of...

760
00:44:53.391 --> 00:44:56.659
Aah!

761
00:44:56.661 --> 00:44:58.594
Ow.

762
00:44:58.596 --> 00:45:00.062
All right.
Calm down.


763
00:45:00.064 --> 00:45:01.998
Oh, fuck.

764
00:45:03.034 --> 00:45:04.633
At least you're not that guy.

765
00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:06.502
Move aside, pussies.
Come on.


766
00:45:06.504 --> 00:45:08.771
Wait. Wait.
I have an idea.


767
00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:21.384
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Fuck you!


768
00:45:21.386 --> 00:45:22.651
You're cool!
Fuck you!


769
00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:24.553
Are we done here yet?

770
00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.022
We are now.

771
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:30.092
Here, take my phone.

772
00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:33.429
I need you to film something.

773
00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:34.463
Film what?

774
00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:36.732
Okay. Here we go.

775
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:42.371
Case file 32376,
the people vs. Reed.


776
00:45:42.373 --> 00:45:44.306
Now, you all know
the court case,


777
00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:48.177
but let's discuss Mr. nevil Reed
the man, shall we?


778
00:45:48.179 --> 00:45:50.312
By all accounts, Mr. Reed

779
00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:53.049
was an upstanding pillar
of the community,


780
00:45:53.051 --> 00:45:56.519
earned two master's degrees
by the age of 21.


781
00:45:56.521 --> 00:45:58.454
He married his
college sweetheart


782
00:45:58.456 --> 00:46:01.490
and is the father
of beautiful twin girls.


783
00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:09.198
But when Mr. Reed contracted
the ID-7 virus, shit got real.


784
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.301
"Overwhelmed by pure ID,"

785
00:46:12.303 --> 00:46:15.371
nevil Reed became prone
to involuntary,


786
00:46:15.373 --> 00:46:19.075
aberrant, and shocking impulses.

787
00:46:19.077 --> 00:46:20.543
He commited a gruesome,

788
00:46:20.545 --> 00:46:23.779
unspeakable act
in broad daylight


789
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:28.317
"in a room full of witnesses."

790
00:46:28.319 --> 00:46:33.622
Now, we're witnessing
a model citizen here


791
00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:36.826
transformed into a brutal,

792
00:46:36.828 --> 00:46:40.329
bloodthirsty killing machine

793
00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:44.266
at the blink of an infected eye.

794
00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:46.602
So I ask you this.

795
00:46:46.604 --> 00:46:50.339
Is it his fault
or is it the virus's?


796
00:46:56.379 --> 00:46:59.215
Let's discuss.

797
00:46:59.217 --> 00:47:01.450
See you soon, fuckers.

798
00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.657
Shit.

799
00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:13.295
Kara, he's on his way up.
He has got Lester's key card.


800
00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:14.530
Oh, really?

801
00:47:14.532 --> 00:47:17.433
That's a shame,
a real shame, sir.


802
00:47:17.435 --> 00:47:20.136
Just wondering, did they
get it before or after


803
00:47:20.138 --> 00:47:21.904
butchering Lester
with an electric saw?


804
00:47:21.906 --> 00:47:25.207
Just calm down and come up here!

805
00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:27.176
They're guarding
the private elevator.


806
00:47:27.178 --> 00:47:28.544
I can't leave the office.

807
00:47:28.546 --> 00:47:29.812
Then destroy the card.

808
00:47:29.814 --> 00:47:32.548
It's my only leverage.

809
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:35.217
Kara, I promise you,

810
00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:39.155
I will do everything in my power
to ensure he doesn't get to you.


811
00:47:39.157 --> 00:47:42.525
But if he does, you must
protect those above you.


812
00:47:42.527 --> 00:47:43.893
Fuck those above me!

813
00:47:43.895 --> 00:47:45.561
I'll give you the raise
you always wanted.


814
00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:46.929
Fuck your raise!

815
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:49.298
I'll make you partner.

816
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.535
Fuck your... deal.

817
00:47:52.537 --> 00:47:54.170
I'll throw it out the window.

818
00:47:54.172 --> 00:47:56.839
Oh, thank you.

819
00:48:06.417 --> 00:48:07.750
Meg!

820
00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:13.822
Hide this somewhere safe
and don't tell me where.


821
00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:16.892
And make more
fucking coffee now!


822
00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:18.494
Stupid bitch.

823
00:48:24.502 --> 00:48:26.869
The elevator's
the only way upstairs.


824
00:48:26.871 --> 00:48:28.470
We can ambush her here.

825
00:48:28.472 --> 00:48:32.241
Well, it's gonna be a while.

826
00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:34.210
Top three bands, go.

827
00:48:34.212 --> 00:48:35.344
Only three?

828
00:48:35.346 --> 00:48:36.979
Only three, that's the rules.

829
00:48:36.981 --> 00:48:39.315
All right.

830
00:48:39.317 --> 00:48:41.217
- Motorhead.
- Oh.


831
00:48:41.219 --> 00:48:44.987
D. R. I. And early Anthrax.

832
00:48:44.989 --> 00:48:46.488
- Oh.
- Metal till I fucking puke.


833
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.856
All right. Okay.

834
00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:49.725
That's not what I expected,
but fine choices.


835
00:48:49.727 --> 00:48:53.429
What did you... what did you
expect, the Dave Matthews Band?


836
00:48:53.431 --> 00:48:55.798
Hey, Dave Matthews Band
is actually a good...


837
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.500
other way, asshole. Go.
Turn around. Yep. You got it.


838
00:48:58.502 --> 00:48:59.868
You fucking dick, Joe!

839
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.704
What?

840
00:49:01.706 --> 00:49:04.373
Dave Matthews Band
is a good band.


841
00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:06.909
- Oh, my god.
- You ever heard them live?


842
00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:09.912
I would rather chew glass.

843
00:49:09.914 --> 00:49:11.313
Are you serious?

844
00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:12.615
Just because they're popular

845
00:49:12.617 --> 00:49:15.417
doesn't mean
that they're bad at music.


846
00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:16.785
I think it's actually
that people think


847
00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.887
it's more popular
to dislike them,


848
00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:20.256
so they're just trying
to be cool.


849
00:49:20.258 --> 00:49:21.457
- It's bullshit.
- All right. Fine.


850
00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:22.791
I'll go see them at burning man.

851
00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:24.560
All right,
make fun all you want,


852
00:49:24.562 --> 00:49:27.563
but if we ever get out of here,
I'm gonna get us tickets,


853
00:49:27.565 --> 00:49:29.565
all right, to the coliseum
show in July.


854
00:49:29.567 --> 00:49:31.333
And I'm gonna take you there,

855
00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:33.302
and I'm gonna turn you on
to some great musicianship.


856
00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:34.770
- You're gonna turn me on?
- Turn you on, yes.


857
00:49:34.772 --> 00:49:38.274
Before or after we go out
to buy birkenstocks?


858
00:49:38.276 --> 00:49:39.708
- Fuck off.
- Do you wear them with socks?


859
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:40.976
I bet you do.

860
00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:43.445
Okay. So... so...
so just tell me again


861
00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:47.283
why you can't send a unit in
to just stop this asshole.


862
00:49:47.285 --> 00:49:50.519
A heavily armed SWAT team in a
building filled with civilians


863
00:49:50.521 --> 00:49:53.922
infected with the virus
would be catastrophic.


864
00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.691
For that, we need to...

865
00:49:55.693 --> 00:49:57.693
excuse me.
What are you doing?


866
00:49:57.695 --> 00:49:59.595
Allergies.

867
00:49:59.597 --> 00:50:01.864
Who are you,
my fucking therapist?


868
00:50:01.866 --> 00:50:05.000
Anyway, all we can do
is talk to the employee


869
00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:07.403
in an attempt to defuse
the situation.


870
00:50:07.405 --> 00:50:09.405
We currently have
a psychologist on-site


871
00:50:09.407 --> 00:50:12.041
who could possibly talk
to the infected individual.


872
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.580
Notify the team
down in accounting.


873
00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:21.784
I'm offering 150 grand
for Cho's head.


874
00:50:21.786 --> 00:50:24.420
You're talking
about murder here.


875
00:50:24.422 --> 00:50:26.822
You should be offering
at least 450.


876
00:50:26.824 --> 00:50:28.457
Agreed.

877
00:50:45.943 --> 00:50:47.876
Four hours left
till the quarantine lifts.


878
00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:49.545
We're running out of time.

879
00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:53.449
Well, sometimes you got to say,
"what the fuck?


880
00:50:53.451 --> 00:50:54.750
Make your move."

881
00:50:54.752 --> 00:50:58.087
- "Risky business."
- Yeah.


882
00:50:58.089 --> 00:51:00.055
All right.
Whew.


883
00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:24.873
Hello, Derek?
My name's mark.


884
00:52:24.875 --> 00:52:27.443
I'm a psychologist
working with the CDC.


885
00:52:27.445 --> 00:52:29.945
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, he can hear you, mark.


886
00:52:29.947 --> 00:52:31.180
I was just told that you were

887
00:52:31.182 --> 00:52:32.848
under a bit of stress right now,

888
00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.050
so I wanted to check in on you.

889
00:52:35.052 --> 00:52:37.853
Can we talk?
Can you tell me how you feel?


890
00:52:37.855 --> 00:52:42.591
Um, how do I feel?

891
00:52:42.593 --> 00:52:48.030
Um I feel like
taking my clothes off.


892
00:52:48.032 --> 00:52:50.566
Mm-hmm.
I feel like causing


893
00:52:50.568 --> 00:52:53.869
extraordinary amounts
of property damage.


894
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:55.871
I feel like I want to scream.
I want to fuck.


895
00:52:55.873 --> 00:53:01.176
I feel like twisting limbs
and breaking bones!


896
00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:02.644
I feel great, mark.

897
00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:04.880
That's the virus talking.

898
00:53:04.882 --> 00:53:06.215
I agree, mark.

899
00:53:06.217 --> 00:53:08.717
Derek isn't thinking
clearly right now.


900
00:53:08.719 --> 00:53:11.253
He's so consumed by his ID
that he hasn't noticed


901
00:53:11.255 --> 00:53:13.722
that we're just here
to help him.


902
00:53:13.724 --> 00:53:15.524
You should listen to her, Derek.

903
00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:19.161
Why don't you sit down,
take a breath, and talk it out?


904
00:53:19.163 --> 00:53:20.762
Talk it out.

905
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.900
Hmm.

906
00:53:30.007 --> 00:53:31.673
Sure.

907
00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:33.976
- I'll talk it out.
- Yeah.


908
00:53:33.978 --> 00:53:36.645
Let's just have a conversation.

909
00:53:36.647 --> 00:53:37.946
Track three.

910
00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:45.654
Better not be fucking
Dave Matthews Band.


911
00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:49.024
Okay.

912
00:53:49.026 --> 00:53:53.529
Those of you who don't want to
be a part of this can leave now.


913
00:53:53.531 --> 00:53:55.163
Derek, please listen to me.

914
00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.965
But if you choose to stay,

915
00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:59.835
which it seems like
you guys are choosing...


916
00:53:59.837 --> 00:54:02.671
- Derek, please.
- You understand and agree


917
00:54:02.673 --> 00:54:04.806
to the following
terms and conditions.


918
00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.708
- Derek!
- One...


919
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:07.943
Derek, this is
the virus talking.


920
00:54:07.945 --> 00:54:09.311
You hereby waive your right...

921
00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:10.913
- Derek, please.
- To your own personal


922
00:54:10.915 --> 00:54:12.114
bodily integrity.

923
00:54:12.116 --> 00:54:13.849
- This is not you.
- Two...


924
00:54:13.851 --> 00:54:14.917
I'm a licensed psychologist.

925
00:54:14.919 --> 00:54:17.085
Per the state vs. Nevil Reed,

926
00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:20.222
my colleague and I will not
be held criminally liable


927
00:54:20.224 --> 00:54:24.059
for any felony or misdemeanor
that you may be a victim of,


928
00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:28.797
including but not limited
to aggravated assault,


929
00:54:28.799 --> 00:54:31.700
aggravated battery,
disorderly conduct,


930
00:54:31.702 --> 00:54:36.104
destruction of property, mayhem,
and first-degree murder.


931
00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:42.878
And, three, terms and conditions
may change or be updated


932
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.980
whenever the fuck I want!

933
00:54:47.585 --> 00:54:50.886
Consider yourselves notified.

934
00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:27.789
Aah!

935
00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:11.299
Hello?

936
00:56:11.301 --> 00:56:13.835
Derek?

937
00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:16.438
Is anyone there?

938
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.708
Knock, knock.

939
00:56:25.015 --> 00:56:28.450
<i>Key card, por favor.</i>

940
00:56:28.452 --> 00:56:32.120
If you want it,
you'll have to negotiate.


941
00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:35.090
Negotiations have ended.

942
00:56:35.092 --> 00:56:36.825
Well, so will the quarantine,

943
00:56:36.827 --> 00:56:38.827
and I don't know
where the key card is.


944
00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:43.098
- What do you want?
- A truce.


945
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.301
Fuck your truce.

946
00:56:46.303 --> 00:56:48.837
No truce, no key card.

947
00:56:51.842 --> 00:56:53.308
All right.

948
00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:57.179
Tell me where it is,

949
00:56:57.181 --> 00:57:01.216
and I promise I'll be on my way
and leave you alone.


950
00:57:03.386 --> 00:57:07.255
You're a man
of your word, Derek.


951
00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:10.759
That's why I believe you.

952
00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:13.862
And that's... that's why
you never made partner.


953
00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:16.164
Key card.

954
00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:18.366
Key card, Derek.

955
00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:20.302
Don't be stupid now.

956
00:57:23.741 --> 00:57:25.340
There's a good boy.

957
00:57:25.342 --> 00:57:27.375
- Meg!
- Yeah, Meg!


958
00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:37.352
Take your key card,
Derek, and fuck off.


959
00:57:37.354 --> 00:57:40.088
What card?

960
00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:45.127
All I see is a useless piece of
scorched plastic on the table.


961
00:57:45.129 --> 00:57:48.296
Strange.
Me too.


962
00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:51.133
- Is that what you see, too, Meg?
- Yep.


963
00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:53.435
So tell me, Meg, sweetie,

964
00:57:53.437 --> 00:57:57.038
why did you bring me
this useless piece of plastic


965
00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.840
instead of my key card?

966
00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:02.177
Oh, that is your key card,
or it used to be


967
00:58:02.179 --> 00:58:05.080
before I put it inside
a microwave oven.


968
00:58:05.082 --> 00:58:08.784
And why would you do that,
I wonder? Huh?


969
00:58:08.786 --> 00:58:13.922
You're exactly like
every other assistant, Meg.


970
00:58:13.924 --> 00:58:18.860
You're a vapid, bottom-feeding,
parasitic shithead!


971
00:58:18.862 --> 00:58:22.864
You're a pair of tits
with zero talent.


972
00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:25.934
So tell me, Meg,
you incompetent cunt,


973
00:58:25.936 --> 00:58:29.271
what could possibly possess you
to destroy my key card?


974
00:58:29.273 --> 00:58:32.541
Because everyone upstairs
knew you would betray them.


975
00:58:32.543 --> 00:58:34.342
So they offered me a promotion

976
00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:36.812
in exchange for
destroying the card.


977
00:58:36.814 --> 00:58:38.280
So

978
00:58:38.282 --> 00:58:43.084
I guess I no longer work
for you, you fucking bitch.


979
00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:46.822
In fact, I don't have to listen

980
00:58:46.824 --> 00:58:51.359
to your hideous,
shrill voice ever again!


981
00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:53.428
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!


982
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:55.096
Aah!

983
00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:14.082
Now it's a party!

984
00:59:14.084 --> 00:59:16.184
Oh, my god! Yes!

985
00:59:16.186 --> 00:59:19.221
Hey, just wanted to say,

986
00:59:19.223 --> 00:59:22.958
no more lies,
no more power games...


987
00:59:25.394 --> 00:59:27.529
no more bullshit,

988
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:32.100
and no more Siren song.

989
00:59:33.502 --> 00:59:39.241
By the way,
Meg, she's a little crazy.


990
00:59:39.243 --> 00:59:41.009
She's perfect here.

991
00:59:52.889 --> 00:59:55.290
Dude, that freak show had
some super-good-quality shoes.


992
00:59:55.292 --> 00:59:58.627
These are comfy as fuck!

993
00:59:58.629 --> 01:00:01.329
- I loved this mug.
- Mm.


994
01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:13.208
I got it on the, uh,
first day that I started here.


995
01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:15.076
My sister gave it to me.

996
01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:23.585
Fuck this place.

997
01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:33.528
Do you still have that, um,
foreclosure paperwork on you?


998
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:35.263
Uh, yeah.

999
01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.268
Why?

1000
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.270
Let me take a little look at it.

1001
01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:53.014
What?

1002
01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:56.351
You're in luck.

1003
01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:59.087
This mortgage is
part of a bad batch.


1004
01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:00.689
Original paperwork
was filed so many times


1005
01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:03.358
that it'd be tough to find.

1006
01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.561
- Oh.
- Could even be lost.


1007
01:01:06.563 --> 01:01:09.097
So if I ask the bank
for the original paperwork...


1008
01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:11.232
You'd put them in a tough spot.

1009
01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:19.507
Or a signature from upstairs
could void it completely.


1010
01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.608
Really?

1011
01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:31.720
Hey, I'm sorry for not
helping you earlier.


1012
01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:36.458
I should've, but I didn't.

1013
01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.693
It's okay.

1014
01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.262
Just don't do it again, I guess.

1015
01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:52.540
You rolling?

1016
01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:55.343
Push back. Push back.

1017
01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:58.013
All right. Stop.

1018
01:01:58.015 --> 01:01:59.447
Can you see him?

1019
01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.388
No.

1020
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:08.023
Fuck you, Derek.

1021
01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:15.730
Is that your friend?

1022
01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:19.200
Oh, god.

1023
01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:22.037
Hey, give that to me.

1024
01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:25.306
Hey.
Hey, it's all right.


1025
01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.577
He has kids.

1026
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:35.617
Ah! Oh, god.

1027
01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:37.585
I'm so sorry.

1028
01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.055
I'm sorry.

1029
01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:42.323
This fucking virus,
it just takes...


1030
01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:45.427
just takes everything up to 11.

1031
01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.162
I've noticed.

1032
01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.398
Hey.

1033
01:03:56.633 --> 01:03:58.366
Ahh.

1034
01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:00.502
- I know, right?
- Yeah.


1035
01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.804
- I like this virus.
- Yeah.


1036
01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:04.672
So what now?

1037
01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:08.409
Um, I think we should
definitely exchange numbers,


1038
01:04:08.411 --> 01:04:10.678
consider an apartment,
maybe a dog.


1039
01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.248
- That'd be nice.
- No, you idiot! What now?


1040
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:16.384
Um, let's see.

1041
01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.657
Ray sent an update
to the office staff.


1042
01:04:22.659 --> 01:04:24.459
Who's ray?

1043
01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:25.760
He's the it guy.

1044
01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:29.364
Fuckers.

1045
01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.733
There must be another way
we can get up there.


1046
01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:35.436
Not without the key card.

1047
01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:37.839
Unless...

1048
01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:41.809
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.


1049
01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.344
Unless what?

1050
01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.647
What's he want?

1051
01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:47.315
Ray can't fix the elevators,

1052
01:04:47.317 --> 01:04:48.883
but I have another idea.

1053
01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:54.389
Ray!

1054
01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.658
I'm really busy right now!

1055
01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.527
God damn it! Fuck you!
Why won't you fucking work?


1056
01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:00.795
- Ugh!
- Ray!


1057
01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:03.364
Aaah!

1058
01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:04.966
Hey.

1059
01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:07.735
- Hi.
- Hey.


1060
01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.338
We need your help.

1061
01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.740
Holy shit!
How'd that happen?


1062
01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.977
Well, we asked for his help,
and then he said he was busy.


1063
01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:19.881
Really?
Welcome to it.


1064
01:05:19.883 --> 01:05:22.217
We need you to hack
into someone's computer.


1065
01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:24.219
And I need interpol
to get off my back,


1066
01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:27.989
so what else is fucking new?

1067
01:05:27.991 --> 01:05:29.724
Who we talking about?

1068
01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:30.992
Irene Smythe.

1069
01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:33.795
Oh, fuck her.

1070
01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.901
What? What the...

1071
01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:43.404
Shh.

1072
01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:44.806
It department.

1073
01:05:44.808 --> 01:05:46.574
What's wrong with my computer?

1074
01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:48.810
Doctor can't do much until
you tell him where it hurts.


1075
01:05:48.812 --> 01:05:52.380
My Internet is slower
than your brain.


1076
01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:54.782
Well, that's a miracle
considering the budget


1077
01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.918
that I have
for installs and updates.


1078
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.354
Seriously, how do you expect me
to keep running things


1079
01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:01.923
if you have one guy in one room

1080
01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:04.659
down in the fucking basement
doing everything?


1081
01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:05.960
Seriously, and what do I get?

1082
01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:08.663
I get denial, denial,
denial, denial,


1083
01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:10.698
denial on all my fucking
budgets, right?


1084
01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.301
But, "oh, ray,
please give me an app!"


1085
01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:14.969
- "Make sure that..."
- I am shocked!


1086
01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.504
I'm shocked and appalled,

1087
01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:17.972
and I'll definitely
bring this up with John,


1088
01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.008
but in the meantime,
can you do your fucking job?


1089
01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:22.410
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Cool your bloomers.


1090
01:06:22.412 --> 01:06:23.878
Hold on.

1091
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.281
- Just sent you a patch.
- A patch?


1092
01:06:26.283 --> 01:06:28.516
It's a file that you install

1093
01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:30.952
on that thing in front of you
called a computer.


1094
01:06:30.954 --> 01:06:32.654
Okay.

1095
01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:35.890
Look, this might get complicated
for you, but don't worry.


1096
01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:37.959
I'll take you through
the whole process myself.


1097
01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:39.627
- You ready?
- Okay.


1098
01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:41.796
Click on the file
that's on your desktop.


1099
01:06:41.798 --> 01:06:46.401
- Done.
- Now click "install."


1100
01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:50.038
So rude.

1101
01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.608
You know, funny enough,

1102
01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:55.576
I think the virus
actually made her nicer.


1103
01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:56.744
Mm.

1104
01:06:57.814 --> 01:06:59.580
I could've called that file

1105
01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:02.450
mean trojan destroyer,
the ultimate hard drive rapist,


1106
01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:05.820
and she still would
have installed it.


1107
01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:08.656
And we're in.

1108
01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:11.659
Okay. So what we're looking at,
th... those are her files?


1109
01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:14.562
Every last one of them,
even the porn.


1110
01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:16.664
Seems she's got
a thing for feet.


1111
01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:18.399
What do you want?

1112
01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:20.735
I want you to pretend that
that is a peaceful village


1113
01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:23.438
inhabited by gorgeous
virgin maidens.


1114
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.474
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and
you're the, you know, smelly,


1115
01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:29.577
aggressive viking king.

1116
01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:30.945
You had me at peaceful.

1117
01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:34.782
What... what the...

1118
01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.788
Ray, you ignoramus, that patch
thing has erased my hard drive.


1119
01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.490
Hey, Irene.

1120
01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:45.927
I got good news, bad news,
and worse news for you.


1121
01:07:45.929 --> 01:07:47.495
Good news is, is we have a copy

1122
01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:49.597
of your hard drive
on the backup server.


1123
01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:53.568
<i>Bad news is that I have it.</i>

1124
01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:57.105
Worse news is that,
if you want it,


1125
01:07:57.107 --> 01:07:59.874
you got to come down and get it.

1126
01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.644
What trade?

1127
01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:05.913
The backup copy for my key card.

1128
01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:09.450
That backup is worth
millions to this firm.


1129
01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:11.085
Are you actually
listening to me?


1130
01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:13.121
I'm meeting him.
End of story.


1131
01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:16.424
Oh, great. Should I just
remove my pants now


1132
01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:19.060
to make it easier for him when
he comes up here to fuck me?


1133
01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:22.063
I'm not going to
give him my key card.


1134
01:08:22.065 --> 01:08:24.031
Well, he has got
leverage against you.


1135
01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:27.535
The idiot let me decide
on the meeting spot.


1136
01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:33.775
Where's your piece, Colton?

1137
01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:08.042
All right.
She's clean.


1138
01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:09.610
Who is she?

1139
01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:11.646
She's one of the mortgage
accounts that you, uh...


1140
01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:15.082
I'm Melanie cross.
I live at 22nd and pacific.


1141
01:09:15.084 --> 01:09:17.718
Not for long.

1142
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.487
Ah, just...

1143
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:25.526
- key card.
- Files.


1144
01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:38.573
Are you, uh, looking for this?

1145
01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:39.774
Okay.

1146
01:09:39.776 --> 01:09:42.009
Um, just a little pro tip.

1147
01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.778
Employees' iqs at this firm

1148
01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:46.214
are inversely proportionate
to their salaries,


1149
01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:48.182
so it's probably not a good idea

1150
01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:51.986
to try to outsmart someone
with a smaller paycheck.


1151
01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:53.621
Key card.

1152
01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:03.831
Now give me the hard drive.

1153
01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:05.099
I've done my bit.

1154
01:10:05.101 --> 01:10:08.169
Not yet.

1155
01:10:08.171 --> 01:10:09.971
Got to sign this first.

1156
01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:18.212
Oh, oh, I could sign this,

1157
01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:21.148
sure, then claim
temporary insanity


1158
01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.117
and have it dismissed.

1159
01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:27.255
Sorry, sweetie,
but you can always take it


1160
01:10:27.257 --> 01:10:30.992
to the man upstairs with that
card you've got if you like.


1161
01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:40.735
Ooh!

1162
01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:42.803
You fucking whore!

1163
01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:45.239
- Give us a minute.
- Yeah, totally.


1164
01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:58.286
Ah, ah, ah!

1165
01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:43.064
Bullets are for cowards.

1166
01:11:43.066 --> 01:11:45.166
Oh, shit.

1167
01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:49.370
Aah!

1168
01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:56.877
No, no, wait!

1169
01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.312
That card doesn't work.

1170
01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.880
It needs an access code.

1171
01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:14.095
Aah!

1172
01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:30.244
I got it.

1173
01:12:30.246 --> 01:12:33.147
No. No!

1174
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:36.083
No, no! No!

1175
01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:37.952
I'm gonna burn your eyes out.

1176
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:42.757
Aah!

1177
01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.426
Ah!

1178
01:13:22.799 --> 01:13:26.067
I am done fucking around.

1179
01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:27.835
Give us the code right now.

1180
01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:32.073
I'll give you the code,
but here's the new deal, boy.


1181
01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:33.708
- You give me her.
- What?


1182
01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:35.342
She destroyed my work.
That's years of my life.


1183
01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:37.378
You want your revenge?
Well, give me mine.


1184
01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:40.748
I just want my home back,
you asshole!


1185
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:44.118
The quarantine is ending soon.

1186
01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.453
Your time is running out.

1187
01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:47.354
Give me the access code!

1188
01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:49.390
I'll give you a pro tip.

1189
01:13:49.392 --> 01:13:51.726
You want to swim to the top?

1190
01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:53.994
Drop the dead weight.

1191
01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.296
She'll do it.

1192
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.301
Five!

1193
01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:01.802
Four!

1194
01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.906
Three.

1195
01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:12.413
- Two!
- One.


1196
01:14:12.415 --> 01:14:14.448
Deal.

1197
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:16.917
Aah!

1198
01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:20.254
Fuck you, Derek,
you piece-of-shit suit!


1199
01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:22.523
You're just like all of them!
You belong here!


1200
01:14:22.525 --> 01:14:25.793
Aah, fuck!

1201
01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.129
- Done?
- Mm-hmm.


1202
01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:33.167
Fuck you!
Fuck you.


1203
01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:37.004
I'll be back shortly, sweetie.
Come on.


1204
01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:09.370
These things only work once.

1205
01:15:09.372 --> 01:15:11.071
Don't do anything stupid.

1206
01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:54.849
Can you see it, Derek?

1207
01:15:54.851 --> 01:15:57.384
Can you see the solution
to our problem here?


1208
01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:05.326
You're infected.
You have impunity!


1209
01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:07.328
Nevil Reed,
he got away with murder.


1210
01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:09.163
Maybe I can have
a little fun here.


1211
01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:14.168
Well, I'm gonna
beat you to the punch.


1212
01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:22.943
Let's discuss.

1213
01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:52.973
What's that?

1214
01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:55.609
The terms of my surrender,
partnership contract.


1215
01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:03.417
You're a fucking piece of shit.

1216
01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:05.052
Look, my guy killed your guy.

1217
01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:07.221
You killed my guy,
so we're even.


1218
01:17:07.223 --> 01:17:09.556
Let's just get down
to business now, huh?


1219
01:17:09.558 --> 01:17:12.526
Ladies.

1220
01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:14.395
Monthly profit participation,

1221
01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:17.464
annual performance bonus,
vehicle allowances,


1222
01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:21.502
gas, maintenance,
insurance, chauffeur.


1223
01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:25.673
Expense accounts,
full cellphone allowances,


1224
01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:28.642
paid parking, country-club fees.

1225
01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:31.378
I've seen you admiring
all of this, Derek.


1226
01:17:33.481 --> 01:17:36.083
Isn't this what
you've always wanted?


1227
01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:37.551
Yes.

1228
01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:40.421
Then why don't I see
a fucking pen in your hand?


1229
01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:44.625
Do you really want to spend
the next 20 years of your life


1230
01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:46.994
just working
your ass off for what,


1231
01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:50.331
maybe half of what
I just offered you?


1232
01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:52.733
Sign it, Derek.

1233
01:17:52.735 --> 01:17:55.169
Sign it,
and I'll suck your cock.


1234
01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.237
Sign it, and I'll help.

1235
01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:59.707
- Be smart.
- Be rich.


1236
01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.421
No.

1237
01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:48.555
Mine's bigger.

1238
01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.090
Mine's always bigger.

1239
01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:01.535
You fucker.

1240
01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:03.203
Aah!

1241
01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:05.572
Gah! Ah!

1242
01:19:08.476 --> 01:19:11.211
That's your problem, Derek.
No vision.


1243
01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:16.383
Aah!

1244
01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:21.088
Fuck you.

1245
01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:30.130
Fuck!
Iron!


1246
01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.502
No, not the 9, the 5!

1247
01:19:46.182 --> 01:19:47.581
Oh!

1248
01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:57.324
Look at your partners.

1249
01:19:57.326 --> 01:20:00.294
Look at your partners!

1250
01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:02.362
You know what they're
thinking right now?


1251
01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:04.198
They're thinking how big
their piece of the pie


1252
01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.235
is gonna get
once you stop taking yours.


1253
01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:10.604
This is where we vote, right?

1254
01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:13.574
Well, then let's vote.
Make it quick.


1255
01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:33.627
Can you do it, Derek?
Can you do it?


1256
01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:35.429
No, because you're
too much of a pussy,


1257
01:20:35.431 --> 01:20:39.266
which is why I'm up here
and you are down there.


1258
01:20:39.268 --> 01:20:41.401
But when this is all over,

1259
01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:43.770
I will piss on your Corpse,
as well.


1260
01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:14.168
And so the king falls.

1261
01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:15.569
With the quarantine
about to lift,


1262
01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:17.671
I finally got to plead
my case to the nine...


1263
01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:22.176
excuse me, eight...
and have my own day in court.


1264
01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:23.644
Surprisingly, given the fact

1265
01:21:23.646 --> 01:21:26.446
that I just threw their former
CEO off a balcony,


1266
01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:29.783
they seemed pretty
willing to listen.


1267
01:21:29.785 --> 01:21:31.451
In a calm and collected manner,

1268
01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:33.453
I explained to them
my situation,


1269
01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:34.855
my dedication to the firm,

1270
01:21:34.857 --> 01:21:36.456
the abuse of company resources

1271
01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:38.692
by those above my pay grade,
yada yada.


1272
01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:40.827
I don't need to bore you
with the long-form version.


1273
01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:43.363
With a sound defense and
in light of the day's events,


1274
01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:44.398
I pled that...

1275
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.302
I think I deserve my job back.

1276
01:21:48.304 --> 01:21:51.205
But as they voted,
it dawned on me,


1277
01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:54.341
something my sister had been
trying to tell me for years,


1278
01:21:54.343 --> 01:21:57.844
what my new friend
reminded me today.


1279
01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:01.748
I didn't have a job.
The job had me.


1280
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:05.319
I was just another
fucking slave to the grind.


1281
01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:09.256
Look, we paint our paths
with the best of intentions,


1282
01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:10.724
but at the end of the day,

1283
01:22:10.726 --> 01:22:14.494
sometimes it takes
a brushstroke of circumstance


1284
01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:17.931
or a deadly virus to set us
on the right path again.


1285
01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:25.572
Oh, and the incident at TSC,
as they're calling it,


1286
01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:28.642
ended up being a watershed case
to finally accelerate a vaccine


1287
01:22:28.644 --> 01:22:31.245
to prevent the symptoms
of the ID-7 virus,


1288
01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:33.981
pending fda approval, of course.

1289
01:22:33.983 --> 01:22:35.549
You're welcome.

1290
01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:36.917
And for the firm itself,

1291
01:22:36.919 --> 01:22:38.685
well, they did what
any corporate asshole


1292
01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.287
in a corner would do.

1293
01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:42.823
They offered me towers' job.

1294
01:22:42.825 --> 01:22:45.792
Finally a seat
at the big kids' table.


1295
01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:10.284
So I took the gig...

1296
01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:12.419
Just long enough
to make an executive decision


1297
01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:13.954
and do some good in the world.

1298
01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:25.766
I quit.

1299
01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:27.601
Now, I know
what you're thinking.


1300
01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:29.703
We wrapped this story up
in a nice little bow,


1301
01:23:29.705 --> 01:23:32.673
and we pretty much just
killed a bunch of people.


1302
01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:34.341
I live with that.

1303
01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:37.477
But they do say everything
happens for a reason.


1304
01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:39.446
I'm starting to believe it.

1305
01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:41.048
Here's one more pro tip.

1306
01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:45.786
Paint your own path to success
in work, love, and life...


1307
01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:51.058
Before it's too fucking late.
