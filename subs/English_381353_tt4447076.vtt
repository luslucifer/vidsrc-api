1
00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:12.083
In the Amazon there are isolated tribes,

2
00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:14.666
Threatened by deforestation.

3
00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:18.291
Some tribes have decided to settle,

4
00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:20.083
Others are still nomadic.

5
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:22.999
Good morning, Vincent!

6
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.208
Yes, that's right, good morning.

7
00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:36.124
I don't know the Amazon.

8
00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:38.249
But to be honest,

9
00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:41.208
I don't know Africa or Asia either,

10
00:01:41.374 --> 00:01:42.874
Nor the rest of the world.

11
00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:47.708
On the other hand,

12
00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.458
Even blindfold, I
could ride here.


13
00:01:50.624 --> 00:01:52.124
I know it by heart.

14
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:57.458
It's out of fashion.

15
00:01:57.624 --> 00:01:58.458
Corinne Beauchamp.

16
00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:00.083
They're announcing a seven.

17
00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:01.166
Oh yes?

18
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:02.541
My daughter is angry with him.

19
00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:03.541
Sylvie Fournier.

20
00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:05.833
The other was his best friend.

21
00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.958
Oh yes?

22
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:10.208
Finally, we opted for
carpet everywhere.


23
00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:11.624
Including the bathroom.

24
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:12.624
Renaud Clery.

25
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:13.624
Oh yes...

26
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.083
My clients, too,
know them by heart.


27
00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:20.124
Salon Machot, hello?

28
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:22.124
Marianne is on the phone.

29
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:23.874
We've been together
for two years.


30
00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:24.874
Finally...

31
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:27.499
I can't say we meet a lot.

32
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.458
She's in Paris for an internship.

33
00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:33.583
It's cancelled every time.

34
00:02:36.374 --> 00:02:38.541
I don't know if I
should go there


35
00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:40.166
And settle down with her.

36
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.708
At the same time,
there's my mother...


37
00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:44.208
It's me, Mum.

38
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:47.708
She's lived alone since
the death of my father.


39
00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:50.749
Finally...
With her soft toys and dolls.


40
00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.916
She's more outgoing.

41
00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.208
You saw?

42
00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:58.249
I sewed a new sweater.

43
00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.208
Oh yes.

44
00:03:00.374 --> 00:03:02.541
It didn't work out.
You've had your hair cut.


45
00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.666
Laurent, my cousin.

46
00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.624
He's also my best friend.

47
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:08.874
Sunday, you come
for a snack at Isa's?


48
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.333
No, I promised Mum...
Stop.


49
00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:15.041
You're not gonna stick it
to the basques all your life.


50
00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:16.458
She's nuts.

51
00:03:16.624 --> 00:03:19.499
No one speaks like
that except him.


52
00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.208
But his claim to glory
is his mistresses.


53
00:03:22.374 --> 00:03:23.374
All married.

54
00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:29.166
My clients, Marianne,
my mother, Laurent,


55
00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:31.458
I know my life by heart.

56
00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:33.708
A simple life.

57
00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:35.749
Quiet.

58
00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:38.666
Until this autumn day...

59
00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:43.166
On her way to work,
Brigitte heard the boy


60
00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:45.416
On the floor of the house in flames.

61
00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:49.624
She rushed to his rescue
before the firemen arrived.


62
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:54.458
It's nice you
remembered my party.


63
00:03:54.624 --> 00:03:56.541
You reminded me 15 times...

64
00:03:57.458 --> 00:04:00.333
Don't fill yourself with bread.
Think of your digestion.


65
00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.374
So, let's see that.
Oh no! No!


66
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:04.583
What?

67
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:08.249
Crab and lemon?
I'm sorry, I forgot.


68
00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:11.083
If you'd listened to what I said...

69
00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.124
Well... I'll go.

70
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:15.249
The market's not
open at this hour.


71
00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:18.833
Never mind.

72
00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:22.708
I was looking forward
to this crab with lemon.


73
00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:12.249
Hello.
Hello.


74
00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:14.999
Looking for something?

75
00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:16.166
Crab.

76
00:05:19.374 --> 00:05:20.374
Um yes.

77
00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:21.791
I'm stupid.

78
00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:22.833
8.40 euros.

79
00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:37.416
Haven't we met before?

80
00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:39.499
No I don't think so.

81
00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:40.749
You are sure?

82
00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:43.541
Yes. Have a good Sunday.

83
00:05:55.374 --> 00:05:57.499
Ah! Help! Help!

84
00:05:57.666 --> 00:05:58.708
Fire!

85
00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:00.624
Oh my God!

86
00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:02.249
Don't panic.
It's only small.


87
00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:03.958
But I'm scared!

88
00:06:04.124 --> 00:06:05.208
No no no.

89
00:06:05.374 --> 00:06:07.916
Simone, quickly!
Let's save the child.


90
00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:10.124
It's me.

91
00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:11.999
Ah!

92
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.458
It took you a while.
I thought you'd run away.


93
00:06:17.624 --> 00:06:20.624
I went to Monplaisir.
You know the grocer there?


94
00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:22.916
How do you think
I'd get there?


95
00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.541
Oh no, it's not true!
What?


96
00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:28.166
The lemon. He forgot the lemon.

97
00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.666
What am I going to do with you?

98
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:34.083
She asked you for
how many rabbits?


99
00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:37.708
Oh! It's over, your
affair with Marianne.


100
00:06:37.874 --> 00:06:41.583
Don't cry, she was the least
amusing chick in France.


101
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:43.041
I don't think so.

102
00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:44.333
Hey, you know what?

103
00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:46.999
Emma's going to introduce
you to all her girlfriends.


104
00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:51.166
It's not over with Marianne.
I'll see her in Paris on the 17th.


105
00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:54.166
Maybe we'll move in together.
Give me a break.


106
00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:58.583
If you wanted to live with her,
you'd already be there.


107
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:02.624
What do you think?
Wow.


108
00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:04.416
It's tip top!

109
00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:08.041
It's good. We'll see if
there's anything else.


110
00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:09.041
Hey...

111
00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:12.124
You have to show your
girlfriends to my cousin.


112
00:08:44.874 --> 00:08:46.499
Rosalie Blum?

113
00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:03.624
Hello.

114
00:09:04.416 --> 00:09:05.916
Ah!

115
00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:53.416
Don't be jealous, 
I'm having fun.

116
00:09:54.041 --> 00:09:55.499
That convinces me.

117
00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:57.499
Yes I know...

118
00:09:57.833 --> 00:09:59.124
I'll do more.

119
00:10:29.624 --> 00:10:32.124
Turn off your phones!
Thank you.


120
00:10:32.291 --> 00:10:33.708
Well, come on.

121
00:10:43.374 --> 00:10:45.124
I've already explained it to you.

122
00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:47.291
You turn the knob.
The red one?


123
00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:49.874
Turn it to the left.
It's not lighting up.


124
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:52.458
You're doing it on purpose.
It doesn't work.


125
00:10:52.624 --> 00:10:54.416
I turn... ah, yes.
It works.


126
00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:56.583
You see when you want to.
See you tomorrow.


127
00:10:56.749 --> 00:10:58.458
Remember the butcher.
I haven't forgotten.


128
00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.708
Scallops. Goodbye.

129
00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:14.458
You want something?

130
00:12:14.624 --> 00:12:16.999
Yes, a Coke without ice.
Okay.


131
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:43.541
You're an idiot.

132
00:12:43.708 --> 00:12:46.333
Hey?
Valerie, Emma's girlfriend.


133
00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.124
We agreed to have a drink yesterday.

134
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:50.624
Oh shit.
Sorry, I forgot.


135
00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:53.208
Yeah, whore, what's
wrong with you?


136
00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:54.499
Nothing.

137
00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:56.583
For 2 weeks, you
can't be contacted.


138
00:12:56.749 --> 00:12:57.833
My phone's offline.

139
00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:00.541
And what's that
creepy hat?


140
00:13:01.249 --> 00:13:03.333
Laurent Machot?
Yes, the same.


141
00:13:10.041 --> 00:13:12.041
You know what's wrong?
No.


142
00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.416
Married guys are too jealous.

143
00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:16.666
Turn your head.

144
00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:19.208
You like
Chinese movies now?


145
00:13:19.374 --> 00:13:21.166
Not Chinese, Japanese.

146
00:13:23.124 --> 00:13:24.749
Wait, I'm coming.

147
00:13:28.458 --> 00:13:30.291
Yes it's me.

148
00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:33.374
Now?
OK.


149
00:13:34.124 --> 00:13:35.624
One moment please.

150
00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:39.416
This is the National
Census Statistics Committee.


151
00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:42.499
I'm listening to you.

152
00:13:42.666 --> 00:13:45.458
You live at 8 place St. Laurent?
Yes.


153
00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:47.999
I see there's another Machot
in the building.


154
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:49.208
It's normal?

155
00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:52.749
It's my mother, Simone.
She lives above.


156
00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.666
Alone?
If you don't count the fluff.


157
00:13:55.833 --> 00:13:57.166
Yes, alone.

158
00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:58.583
And you? Married?

159
00:13:58.749 --> 00:14:00.041
Single?

160
00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:01.416
Do you have a box for...

161
00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:05.458
Has not seen his girlfriend for

162
00:14:05.624 --> 00:14:07.541
Because 6 months is a long time.

163
00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:09.833
I don't have that box.
Record single.


164
00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:11.416
Good. Goodbye.

165
00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.874
We'll send you the statistics.
Thank you.


166
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:15.541
Little liar.
What?


167
00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:17.083
You're not single.

168
00:14:17.249 --> 00:14:19.624
Bah...
You're married to your mother.


169
00:14:20.916 --> 00:14:21.749
You're stupid.

170
00:14:26.374 --> 00:14:28.208
It's good, your thing.

171
00:14:28.374 --> 00:14:30.541
Did you hear that?

172
00:16:08.874 --> 00:16:12.208
Thomas, at night, I talk
to you when I'm not asleep.


173
00:16:12.374 --> 00:16:15.499
That's to say, often.
Words come easily.


174
00:16:15.666 --> 00:16:18.916
Everything is so simple when
I speak to you in my bed.


175
00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:22.958
And as soon as I want to write to
you, I don't know where to start.


176
00:16:38.499 --> 00:16:40.083
Thomas, my love,

177
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.874
This letter, I have done
it 100 times, 1000 times.


178
00:16:44.666 --> 00:16:47.583
It's the weight of past mistakes
that makes it difficult


179
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:49.583
What do I want to tell you?

180
00:17:13.249 --> 00:17:14.624
Go and talk to her.

181
00:17:14.791 --> 00:17:15.999
Sorry?

182
00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:18.166
You keep looking at her.

183
00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:23.874
There, at the bar, with the glasses.

184
00:17:24.041 --> 00:17:24.999
Not at all.

185
00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:26.749
Oh, but yes.

186
00:17:26.916 --> 00:17:27.874
I swear

187
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:29.374
That you mate. Not true?

188
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:31.749
Yeah, you're dying.
Whatever.


189
00:17:31.916 --> 00:17:34.249
Go and have a drink with her.
She's alone like you.


190
00:17:35.374 --> 00:17:37.749
Maybe it's not her style?

191
00:17:37.916 --> 00:17:39.708
It's possible.
So...


192
00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:41.624
That's true...

193
00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:42.999
Wait and see.

194
00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:44.583
Oh, the...

195
00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:47.166
You'll see, look.
He's strong.


196
00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:50.416
Hello Miss.
You're alone, it is a shame.


197
00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:52.291
You could go drink...

198
00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:55.583
with my friend?
You get me?


199
00:17:55.749 --> 00:17:57.333
I don't know him.

200
00:17:57.499 --> 00:18:00.333
Oh no. Come on.
You play it hard.


201
00:18:00.499 --> 00:18:03.041
I'll get you the
woman with glasses.


202
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.416
No, stay, don't.

203
00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:07.416
The woman with glasses...

204
00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:09.208
Leave me alone.

205
00:18:12.749 --> 00:18:14.041
Excuse me, sorry.

206
00:18:14.208 --> 00:18:15.374
No, but it's okay...

207
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:18.083
You're hot, the pair of you.

208
00:18:18.249 --> 00:18:19.458
Shut up!

209
00:19:07.874 --> 00:19:09.458
You take care of him.

210
00:19:11.041 --> 00:19:12.124
A coffee,

211
00:19:12.291 --> 00:19:13.249
Please.

212
00:19:13.416 --> 00:19:15.624
Don't worry.
I'll pamper him


213
00:19:15.791 --> 00:19:17.374
While you go to Paris.

214
00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:19.583
Marianne hasn't canceled, you see.

215
00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:25.541
Yes Mum?

216
00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:27.958
Wait, I don't understand
what you're saying.


217
00:19:28.624 --> 00:19:30.499
What? I'm coming!

218
00:19:30.666 --> 00:19:31.499
No.

219
00:19:31.666 --> 00:19:33.541
You forget every time.

220
00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:35.666
No but ...
Look after him.


221
00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:51.499
Are you okay?
Hmm.


222
00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:57.291
What are you doing?
They pissed on my landing.


223
00:19:59.249 --> 00:20:00.499
There's nothing?

224
00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:03.208
Of course, I cleaned
up, imbecile.


225
00:20:06.166 --> 00:20:08.124
Ah, it's all over again.

226
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.208
You scared me.

227
00:20:10.374 --> 00:20:12.166
Don't worry, they
didn't take anything.


228
00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:13.999
Super
-Simone made them flee.

229
00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:17.916
Mum.

230
00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:20.833
Are you sure?
Thieves who pee?


231
00:20:20.999 --> 00:20:22.833
Of course, I'm sure.

232
00:20:22.999 --> 00:20:25.791
How many?
Well, I don't know.


233
00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.666
A whole band, girls.

234
00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:31.708
A horrible guy with a cow skeleton.
Beurk!


235
00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.124
You think I'm crazy?

236
00:20:40.749 --> 00:20:43.499
It's always when I
go to see Marianne


237
00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:45.958
That it happens.
What do you mean?


238
00:20:47.083 --> 00:20:48.499
Nothing, Mum.
And by the way,


239
00:20:48.666 --> 00:20:51.249
I wonder what you're
gonna do with her.


240
00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:52.583
Bah er...

241
00:20:53.374 --> 00:20:55.749
You're leaving tomorrow so will
you have dinner this evening?


242
00:20:57.124 --> 00:20:58.333
I can't.

243
00:20:58.499 --> 00:21:00.541
I have something
important to finish.


244
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:05.124
Good evening, my name is Vincent.

245
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:06.749
We met at the grocery store.

246
00:21:10.749 --> 00:21:13.458
Good evening, can I
offer you a drink?


247
00:21:13.624 --> 00:21:15.166
It's not flirting.

248
00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:17.166
Oh, I'm not...

249
00:21:18.749 --> 00:21:19.749
Good evening.

250
00:21:26.874 --> 00:21:28.083
Oh, shit.

251
00:22:31.124 --> 00:22:32.791
What the hell is she doing?

252
00:24:24.874 --> 00:24:25.708
Hello?

253
00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:28.333
It's you, Marianne.

254
00:24:28.499 --> 00:24:30.416
Yes, yes, it's okay. It's okay.

255
00:24:30.583 --> 00:24:33.499
Tomorrow will you come to
get me at the station?


256
00:24:37.208 --> 00:24:38.666
You... you're kidding?

257
00:24:39.833 --> 00:24:41.374
I organized everything.

258
00:24:42.249 --> 00:24:44.708
But I'm coming tomorrow
to discuss it.


259
00:24:44.874 --> 00:24:48.166
At the start of the school year, you
talked about sharing an apartment with me.


260
00:24:48.333 --> 00:24:52.124
You've made up your mind, but you
don't have the courage to tell me.


261
00:24:52.291 --> 00:24:53.833
Go ahead, drop it!

262
00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:17.124
Hair salon, hello.

263
00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:18.458
Yes.

264
00:26:20.374 --> 00:26:21.499
Wednesday, yes.

265
00:26:21.666 --> 00:26:22.833
At 3 pm?

266
00:26:22.999 --> 00:26:24.333
Perfect.

267
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:26.333
What name, please?

268
00:26:30.916 --> 00:26:32.624
OK, it's booked.

269
00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:34.749
See you on Wednesday. Goodbye.

270
00:26:46.083 --> 00:26:48.124
You got my letter?

271
00:26:48.291 --> 00:26:49.374
No.

272
00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:51.458
Well, it must have gone astray.

273
00:26:51.624 --> 00:26:52.916
Three times in a row?

274
00:26:54.208 --> 00:26:56.333
You live on which planet?

275
00:26:57.749 --> 00:27:00.083
Does the crisis mean anything to you?

276
00:27:00.708 --> 00:27:03.166
If you don't come to
the appointments...


277
00:27:04.916 --> 00:27:06.791
I called the Manutech company.

278
00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:09.374
I said you've been sick.

279
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:12.291
I got him to take
you for 6 days.


280
00:27:13.708 --> 00:27:15.041
You start tomorrow.

281
00:27:15.791 --> 00:27:17.333
Labelling bottles.

282
00:27:17.499 --> 00:27:20.041
You're overqualified but good...

283
00:27:20.208 --> 00:27:22.874
It's all about getting
started.


284
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:25.041
And then, as they say...

285
00:27:25.208 --> 00:27:27.083
Appetite comes with eating.

286
00:27:32.583 --> 00:27:36.083
In life, the less you do, the
less you want to do.


287
00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:39.916
In other words, laziness
engenders laziness.


288
00:27:40.624 --> 00:27:42.833
In this matter,
without boasting,


289
00:27:42.999 --> 00:27:47.041
I'm a champion. In the winter,
I have the world record.


290
00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:50.791
I might not go out of
my house for days.


291
00:27:52.166 --> 00:27:53.291
Finally...

292
00:27:53.458 --> 00:27:55.041
'At home', is quickly said

293
00:27:55.999 --> 00:27:58.666
I sublet a room in
an old workshop.


294
00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:08.291
The person who hasn't gone back to
bed on a Thursday morning hasn't lived.


295
00:28:18.708 --> 00:28:22.249
I have a flatmate.
He has a plan for a street show.


296
00:28:22.416 --> 00:28:25.583
Flamboyant homage to the
troubadours of forever.


297
00:28:25.749 --> 00:28:28.291
This is the highlight of the show!
The nail!


298
00:28:28.458 --> 00:28:29.916
You're a pervert!

299
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:32.499
But it won't be a real lion!

300
00:28:32.666 --> 00:28:34.749
And it won't be a real striptease!

301
00:28:34.916 --> 00:28:38.999
I'm not asking you for a real
striptease and getting naked.


302
00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:41.416
I just ask you to show
a little breast.


303
00:28:41.583 --> 00:28:42.791
I'm outta here!

304
00:28:42.958 --> 00:28:44.333
That's it, get out!

305
00:28:44.499 --> 00:28:46.749
I'm looking for artists.
True!


306
00:28:46.916 --> 00:28:48.208
Wet willy.

307
00:28:48.374 --> 00:28:49.333
Class.

308
00:28:49.499 --> 00:28:52.416
He has problems with recruitment.
Hi, Aude.


309
00:28:53.208 --> 00:28:55.166
Hey, tell me, sweetie...

310
00:28:55.999 --> 00:28:57.958
I need a vital accessory.

311
00:28:58.124 --> 00:29:00.208
And I was thinking...
Flatmate?


312
00:29:00.374 --> 00:29:02.291
Yeah?
You still owe me money.


313
00:29:02.458 --> 00:29:04.749
I'll pay you back.

314
00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:06.249
I'm on 2-3 shots.

315
00:29:06.416 --> 00:29:08.374
I'll put on the show.

316
00:29:08.541 --> 00:29:09.958
I have almost nothing.

317
00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.374
And uh...

318
00:29:14.458 --> 00:29:16.916
Where is it, this 'almost nothing'?

319
00:29:17.708 --> 00:29:20.374
Fuck, you still
lent him money.


320
00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:21.916
He makes me laugh.

321
00:29:22.083 --> 00:29:24.666
He's not bad.
But we do it.


322
00:29:24.833 --> 00:29:27.583
Why do you get upset?
I don't get upset.


323
00:29:28.958 --> 00:29:32.083
Okay. You'd prefer to stay another
five years as his flatmate,


324
00:29:32.249 --> 00:29:34.166
His goats and his business?

325
00:29:34.333 --> 00:29:36.749
Or have a torrid night
with Ryan Gosling?


326
00:29:36.916 --> 00:29:39.333
This is stupid,
there's no dilemma.


327
00:29:39.499 --> 00:29:41.541
You're upset.
No.


328
00:29:41.708 --> 00:29:42.541
Yes.

329
00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:45.874
Yes, you get upset.

330
00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:49.374
Cecile and Laura, my
two oldest friends.


331
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:52.208
They are like sisters.

332
00:29:52.374 --> 00:29:54.083
A lot more fun.

333
00:29:55.749 --> 00:29:57.666
I saw my mother today.

334
00:29:59.374 --> 00:30:00.666
Did you talk to her?

335
00:30:01.249 --> 00:30:02.416
No.

336
00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:05.124
She was wrapped in her fur.

337
00:30:07.083 --> 00:30:11.083
It's crazy how a bourgeoise
can look like an old whore.


338
00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:16.458
Okay, I'm off.

339
00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:20.208
Tomorrow I stick on labels.
Prick.


340
00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:29.916
I was 25 years old and
didn't long for anything.


341
00:30:30.916 --> 00:30:33.624
I no longer needed to
develop new appetites...


342
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:37.333
Until this call.

343
00:30:42.124 --> 00:30:43.249
Oh shit!

344
00:30:43.999 --> 00:30:45.416
Fuck, what a prick!

345
00:30:45.583 --> 00:30:47.166
The labels, fuck.

346
00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:52.749
Ah, fucking goat!

347
00:30:58.708 --> 00:30:59.541
Hello?

348
00:31:01.666 --> 00:31:02.666
Oh, hello.

349
00:31:04.291 --> 00:31:06.208
Oh no, no.
You're not bothering me.


350
00:31:07.833 --> 00:31:09.458
Uh...

351
00:31:09.624 --> 00:31:10.958
Yeah, if you want.

352
00:31:11.124 --> 00:31:12.291
I dunno.

353
00:31:12.458 --> 00:31:15.083
This afternoon, is that okay?

354
00:31:15.249 --> 00:31:16.083
OK.

355
00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:17.999
Wait, I'll make a note.

356
00:31:18.166 --> 00:31:19.791
Where's my pen?

357
00:31:21.624 --> 00:31:22.999
I'm listening.

358
00:31:25.458 --> 00:31:26.666
Bah uh...

359
00:31:27.416 --> 00:31:28.833
Right away.

360
00:31:30.291 --> 00:31:31.124
Hey...

361
00:31:31.291 --> 00:31:32.624
It wasn't the cops?

362
00:31:34.374 --> 00:31:35.874
Who was it then?

363
00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:37.999
My aunt.

364
00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:03.333
Hello.

365
00:32:04.208 --> 00:32:05.208
Hello.

366
00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:07.124
Come in.

367
00:32:13.499 --> 00:32:15.541
It's nice of you
to come so quickly.


368
00:32:15.708 --> 00:32:17.833
I can't hide
my curiosity.


369
00:32:17.999 --> 00:32:20.666
I guess.
Give me your coat?


370
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:25.041
When we passed
I don't know where...


371
00:32:25.208 --> 00:32:26.458
Rue Emile Zola.

372
00:32:26.958 --> 00:32:29.833
You were with a big redhead.
Yeah...


373
00:32:30.833 --> 00:32:33.708
We were going for a drink.
Anyway, we didn't do it.


374
00:32:33.874 --> 00:32:36.541
What's his name, your boyfriend?
Ex boyfriend.


375
00:32:36.708 --> 00:32:37.583
Mathias.

376
00:32:38.333 --> 00:32:40.999
He's gone with a
brunette with big tits.


377
00:32:41.708 --> 00:32:42.749
You serious?

378
00:32:44.791 --> 00:32:46.958
He looked a bit strange.

379
00:32:49.499 --> 00:32:51.291
Why did you want to see me?

380
00:32:53.374 --> 00:32:55.458
I noticed he
was following me.


381
00:32:56.291 --> 00:32:58.708
When I walk, I do my shopping.

382
00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:01.749
I even saw him at the movies.

383
00:33:02.499 --> 00:33:05.416
Has it been a long time?
I don't really know.


384
00:33:06.499 --> 00:33:08.541
Did you contact the police?
No.


385
00:33:08.708 --> 00:33:10.499
He may be dangerous.

386
00:33:10.666 --> 00:33:14.041
Actually, it intrigues me
more than it worries me.


387
00:33:18.166 --> 00:33:19.541
Would it bother you to follow him?

388
00:33:20.624 --> 00:33:21.666
What?

389
00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:25.583
Just to find out who he is.

390
00:33:25.749 --> 00:33:28.124
Why not ask him?

391
00:33:28.291 --> 00:33:29.333
He'd be frightened,

392
00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:32.416
He'd disappear and I wouldn't
know what he wanted.


393
00:33:33.249 --> 00:33:36.624
You don't have a friend
or someone to ask for you?


394
00:33:37.249 --> 00:33:38.208
Not really.

395
00:33:39.833 --> 00:33:41.291
So why me?

396
00:33:44.208 --> 00:33:45.458
Of your whole family,

397
00:33:45.624 --> 00:33:48.083
You're the only one who
wanted to meet me.


398
00:33:51.249 --> 00:33:54.374
I thought you might have fun
following my follower.


399
00:33:55.874 --> 00:33:57.499
Was I wrong?

400
00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:03.541
Oh, but it's great.
It's awesome.


401
00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:05.374
I was sure you'd say that.

402
00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:08.291
It's all right.
Follow a guy...


403
00:34:08.458 --> 00:34:11.791
You, you always find nothing.
The guys, the food...


404
00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:14.791
No that's not true.
Lucas?


405
00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:17.416
Lucas, lend him
your walkie-talkie!


406
00:34:17.583 --> 00:34:18.999
Fuck, what if,

407
00:34:19.166 --> 00:34:20.666
He's a serial killer.

408
00:34:20.833 --> 00:34:23.333
He's going to cut up and eat your aunt.
Berk!


409
00:34:23.499 --> 00:34:24.458
Did you agree?

410
00:34:24.624 --> 00:34:26.916
I said I was going to think about it.
Ah!


411
00:34:27.083 --> 00:34:28.374
Oh...

412
00:34:29.541 --> 00:34:31.999
I'll bring it back broken.

413
00:34:32.999 --> 00:34:34.624
Okay, come on, stop.

414
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:36.499
Is that your father's sister?'

415
00:34:36.666 --> 00:34:37.958
No, my mother's.

416
00:34:38.124 --> 00:34:39.416
She's the youngest.

417
00:34:39.583 --> 00:34:42.749
My mother always behaved
as if she didn't exist.


418
00:34:42.916 --> 00:34:43.874
Why?

419
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:47.833
I dunno.
It dates from before my birth.


420
00:34:47.999 --> 00:34:49.999
I found out about her very late.

421
00:34:50.166 --> 00:34:52.916
And you know her well?
I dunno.


422
00:34:53.583 --> 00:34:56.166
I tried to get on with her.
We saw each other a little.


423
00:34:57.416 --> 00:34:59.666
I did it to piss-off
my mother.


424
00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:02.083
Good...

425
00:35:02.916 --> 00:35:04.833
You say you accept.

426
00:35:04.999 --> 00:35:08.208
I'll spy for you.
Not in my dreams.


427
00:35:08.374 --> 00:35:11.166
Go please.
I'll follow your orders.


428
00:35:11.333 --> 00:35:12.749
Very, very discreet.

429
00:35:12.916 --> 00:35:13.916
I promise.

430
00:35:14.083 --> 00:35:15.166
Say yes.

431
00:35:15.833 --> 00:35:16.874
Say yes, say yes.

432
00:35:17.916 --> 00:35:18.791
No.

433
00:35:30.249 --> 00:35:32.458
What's that?
Camouflage.


434
00:35:33.249 --> 00:35:34.208
Cecile...

435
00:35:34.874 --> 00:35:36.541
At least take off your glasses.

436
00:35:38.708 --> 00:35:39.791
Is that him?

437
00:35:39.958 --> 00:35:41.124
Come and see.

438
00:35:43.166 --> 00:35:44.624
Behind the post.

439
00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:48.916
Oh...
Oh man, this is crazy!


440
00:35:49.083 --> 00:35:52.541
I feel a vibration.
It's almost sexual.


441
00:35:53.374 --> 00:35:55.249
You never checked?

442
00:36:25.041 --> 00:36:26.374
Wait a bit.

443
00:36:26.541 --> 00:36:27.708
Okay boss.

444
00:36:29.499 --> 00:36:31.374
Oh man, this is great!

445
00:36:46.208 --> 00:36:47.874
He's deosn't look nasty.

446
00:36:48.708 --> 00:36:50.166
Beware.

447
00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:53.249
The guys who look
innocent are the worst.


448
00:36:54.208 --> 00:36:55.833
Do you remember Bruno?

449
00:36:55.999 --> 00:36:57.583
He had a superb head.

450
00:36:57.749 --> 00:36:59.541
In bed, he was a freak.

451
00:36:59.708 --> 00:37:00.833
The first time.

452
00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:03.999
He pulled out a string.
No, I don't want to know.


453
00:37:06.083 --> 00:37:09.416
Another time, a zucchini.
Stop, damn it!


454
00:37:12.124 --> 00:37:14.458
Oh, where do you think you are?

455
00:37:17.749 --> 00:37:19.374
Turn off mobile phones.

456
00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:20.833
Thank you!

457
00:37:20.999 --> 00:37:22.499
Okay, come on, we're back.

458
00:37:44.166 --> 00:37:46.458
Yes Yes Yes.
We'll wait a bit.


459
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:56.958
Good evening.

460
00:37:57.124 --> 00:37:59.999
You want something?
A Coke without ice.


461
00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:00.999
Okay.

462
00:38:21.041 --> 00:38:22.374
First floor.

463
00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:34.291
Vincent Machot.
Vincent the Ripper.


464
00:38:42.916 --> 00:38:44.999
You look disappointed.
No.


465
00:38:45.708 --> 00:38:47.208
Doesn't ring a bell.

466
00:38:47.374 --> 00:38:50.666
Perhaps he's a fan who dare
not ask you for an autograph?


467
00:38:50.833 --> 00:38:52.666
I didn't know you sing.

468
00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:55.083
I started again last year.

469
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.999
Sometimes, with your mother,
I went to the choir.


470
00:38:58.499 --> 00:38:59.374
Mother?

471
00:39:00.458 --> 00:39:01.708
Yes.

472
00:39:01.874 --> 00:39:03.749
She had a pretty little voice.

473
00:39:04.874 --> 00:39:05.958
Well, you're not wrong.

474
00:39:06.124 --> 00:39:07.708
It's you he's following.

475
00:39:08.249 --> 00:39:09.416
Go to the police.

476
00:39:09.958 --> 00:39:10.958
Stop it.

477
00:39:11.458 --> 00:39:13.874
You realise it's not normal.

478
00:39:14.041 --> 00:39:15.874
How long have you
been following people?


479
00:39:16.041 --> 00:39:18.958
If he is, he's a freak.
Why does he do that?


480
00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:20.833
We're going to find out.

481
00:39:21.374 --> 00:39:22.916
It's fun.

482
00:39:23.749 --> 00:39:24.874
Yeah...

483
00:39:27.499 --> 00:39:29.749
Do you still take photos?
No.


484
00:39:29.916 --> 00:39:30.791
Really?

485
00:39:33.666 --> 00:39:36.666
You still have a camera?
I kept it, yeah.


486
00:39:37.958 --> 00:39:40.666
Then you'll take
Vincent Machot's photo.


487
00:39:54.166 --> 00:39:56.958
You'll learn a lot about him.

488
00:39:57.749 --> 00:39:59.541
Your mission expenses.
Stop it.


489
00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:03.249
It's been here for a
month, this croissant.


490
00:40:03.416 --> 00:40:05.416
Well, are you concentrating?

491
00:40:08.458 --> 00:40:10.833
There's two numbers
for Vincent Machot.


492
00:40:10.999 --> 00:40:13.333
A hairdressing salon and home.

493
00:40:14.041 --> 00:40:16.333
There's another
Machot in his building.


494
00:40:16.499 --> 00:40:18.208
What do you mean?

495
00:40:18.374 --> 00:40:21.416
I thought it was a mistake.
It's you, idiot.


496
00:40:21.583 --> 00:40:23.583
S. Machot!
Why are you upset?


497
00:40:23.749 --> 00:40:25.249
I'm not upset, I...

498
00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:29.124
Thank you, Laura,
it's very interesting.


499
00:40:38.958 --> 00:40:40.708
What are you doing?
No.


500
00:40:40.874 --> 00:40:42.291
No no no!

501
00:40:44.499 --> 00:40:45.874
Hello, Mr. Machot?

502
00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:50.166
Hello, this is the National
Census Statistics Committee.


503
00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:51.916
Can I ask you

504
00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:53.416
some questions?

505
00:40:53.583 --> 00:40:54.916
Hang up!

506
00:40:56.333 --> 00:40:58.249
You live at 8 Place
St. Laurent Square?


507
00:40:58.416 --> 00:41:00.041
Hi, girls!

508
00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:01.416
Quiet!

509
00:41:01.583 --> 00:41:03.208
I see there's another Machot

510
00:41:03.374 --> 00:41:04.958
in the building.

511
00:41:05.124 --> 00:41:06.208
Does that remind you of anything?

512
00:41:06.374 --> 00:41:07.624
Only one?

513
00:41:07.791 --> 00:41:08.916
I sold a friend.

514
00:41:09.083 --> 00:41:11.416
I added what you'd given me.

515
00:41:11.583 --> 00:41:14.416
And hid the magnificent lion.

516
00:41:14.583 --> 00:41:16.416
He roared.
She...


517
00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:17.833
I don't have that box.

518
00:41:17.999 --> 00:41:21.041
Well, goodbye.
We'll send you the statistics.


519
00:41:23.541 --> 00:41:24.791
And undercover work.

520
00:41:24.958 --> 00:41:27.666
Wait, you want us
to be found out?


521
00:41:27.833 --> 00:41:29.166
I got news, Chief.

522
00:41:29.333 --> 00:41:32.291
The 'S' is the 'S' of
Simone, his mother.


523
00:41:32.458 --> 00:41:33.999
She lives just above him.

524
00:41:34.708 --> 00:41:36.499
You got something?

525
00:41:43.541 --> 00:41:45.874
Yeah, 8:30...
The bird is a morning person.


526
00:41:49.958 --> 00:41:52.874
For a hairdresser, he's not
a hair champion.


527
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:58.708
He doesn't look like
the yellow jersey...


528
00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:03.624
Here's Rose des Sables.

529
00:42:03.791 --> 00:42:06.874
The bird is leaving the nest.
I repeat. The bird is leaving the nest.


530
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:10.249
Received.

531
00:42:11.958 --> 00:42:13.249
The bird is in sight.

532
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:16.249
Aude, he's coming towards you.

533
00:42:29.083 --> 00:42:30.624
Coffee, donuts.

534
00:42:30.791 --> 00:42:32.499
Okay, Lieutenant?

535
00:42:32.666 --> 00:42:33.749
Qanat's going.

536
00:42:35.416 --> 00:42:37.791
Oh! A donut.

537
00:42:37.958 --> 00:42:39.208
He's going out!

538
00:42:42.791 --> 00:42:45.124
Fuck, he has a rifle!

539
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:49.208
The guy's armed.

540
00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:05.999
Tell you something.

541
00:43:06.166 --> 00:43:08.666
They're knives that don't cut.

542
00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:10.833
They stick-in but don't cut.

543
00:43:10.999 --> 00:43:13.916
Listen carefully.
I'm a real sponge, okay?


544
00:43:14.083 --> 00:43:16.583
If you're afraid, I'll
feel it and hurt you.


545
00:43:16.749 --> 00:43:18.666
But I've already done it.

546
00:43:19.083 --> 00:43:20.833
Hey? Huh, you're relaxing.

547
00:43:20.999 --> 00:43:22.499
Warning... shit.

548
00:43:23.416 --> 00:43:24.583
Here Rose des Sables.

549
00:43:24.749 --> 00:43:27.583
The carton is always
terrified at home.


550
00:43:27.749 --> 00:43:30.291
Cecile, cool it
on the code names.


551
00:43:30.458 --> 00:43:32.208
Received, chief.
Aude?


552
00:43:33.999 --> 00:43:35.083
Hello.

553
00:43:35.958 --> 00:43:37.583
Hi, shrimp!

554
00:43:37.749 --> 00:43:38.666
Wow.

555
00:43:38.833 --> 00:43:39.749
You grew up.

556
00:43:39.916 --> 00:43:42.958
Say hello to your aunt?
Hello.


557
00:43:43.124 --> 00:43:44.541
What are you doing with that?

558
00:43:45.041 --> 00:43:47.791
Ah... it's for my work.

559
00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:49.041
You've finished college?

560
00:43:49.208 --> 00:43:50.166
Yes.

561
00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:53.833
Well if. If...
It's um... for my memory.


562
00:43:53.999 --> 00:43:57.624
Why didn't you come to the
last family party?


563
00:43:57.791 --> 00:43:58.999
We were all there.

564
00:43:59.874 --> 00:44:01.374
I couldn't.

565
00:44:01.541 --> 00:44:02.541
Too bad.

566
00:44:03.166 --> 00:44:05.041
You never say what's going on.

567
00:44:05.208 --> 00:44:07.916
Here Rose des Sables.
The berlingot is home.


568
00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:09.249
I'll stay today.

569
00:44:09.416 --> 00:44:10.916
I've got to go.

570
00:44:11.083 --> 00:44:12.208
Your job's cool!

571
00:44:12.374 --> 00:44:13.624
Yeah.

572
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:15.374
Bye.
Bye.


573
00:44:22.458 --> 00:44:24.166
I've never seen him.

574
00:44:24.749 --> 00:44:27.041
He's not afraid,
our little hairdresser.


575
00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:29.999
My friends think
he's a psychopath.


576
00:44:31.124 --> 00:44:33.249
Because he stole my trash?

577
00:44:33.416 --> 00:44:35.041
It's thin, as a clue.

578
00:44:37.124 --> 00:44:40.124
His mother, have you seen her?
No, never.


579
00:44:42.291 --> 00:44:44.666
Your photos are really good.

580
00:44:44.833 --> 00:44:48.249
You don't want to
become a photographer?


581
00:44:48.416 --> 00:44:49.708
No, it's too hard.

582
00:44:51.791 --> 00:44:53.583
No, I preferred...

583
00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:55.958
To start working.

584
00:44:56.124 --> 00:44:57.791
What are you doing exactly?

585
00:44:58.999 --> 00:45:00.791
Bah er...

586
00:45:00.958 --> 00:45:02.041
Things.

587
00:45:03.208 --> 00:45:04.208
For companies,

588
00:45:04.374 --> 00:45:05.749
Stuff like that.

589
00:45:10.249 --> 00:45:11.291
Who is it?

590
00:45:12.749 --> 00:45:13.999
My son.

591
00:45:14.166 --> 00:45:15.458
You've got a son?

592
00:45:16.333 --> 00:45:18.249
What's his name?
Thomas.


593
00:45:20.166 --> 00:45:21.583
How old is he?

594
00:45:21.749 --> 00:45:22.833
33 Years.

595
00:45:23.416 --> 00:45:24.624
Where does he live?

596
00:45:28.083 --> 00:45:31.416
Why didn't you ever see
her - Vincent's mother?


597
00:45:31.583 --> 00:45:32.791
I dunno.

598
00:45:35.166 --> 00:45:37.583
But I'll keep digging.

599
00:45:38.624 --> 00:45:42.166
We'll find out what he's
doing, Vincent Machot.


600
00:46:10.458 --> 00:46:13.708
Aude, it's Dad.
You met your sister the other day.


601
00:46:13.874 --> 00:46:15.916
It's hard not to
know what's going on.


602
00:46:16.083 --> 00:46:19.124
Christmas is coming and
it would please your mother...


603
00:46:19.291 --> 00:46:20.374
Deleted.

604
00:46:20.541 --> 00:46:24.374
Message received
today at 1:49 pm


605
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:28.041
Miss Cerceau, it's
Mme Gidoin, of Credit Agricole.


606
00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:30.458
I've been waiting

607
00:46:30.624 --> 00:46:33.458
I must remind you of the
importance of the appointment


608
00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:36.166
On pain of closing your account?

609
00:48:19.499 --> 00:48:22.958
Good evening, Miss.
You're alone, it's a pity.


610
00:48:23.124 --> 00:48:26.333
You could go drinking
with my boyfriend.


611
00:48:26.499 --> 00:48:28.624
You... You don't want to lick me?

612
00:48:28.791 --> 00:48:30.416
I don't know him at all.

613
00:48:30.583 --> 00:48:32.708
Oh no, come on.

614
00:48:32.874 --> 00:48:35.458
I'll get you the
woman with glasses.


615
00:48:36.374 --> 00:48:37.791
Don't be stupid.

616
00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:39.083
Woman with glasses...

617
00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:40.333
Oh sorry!

618
00:48:44.874 --> 00:48:45.749
Excuse me.

619
00:48:45.916 --> 00:48:47.416
No, but it will...

620
00:48:47.583 --> 00:48:49.333
You're hot, you two.

621
00:48:49.499 --> 00:48:50.583
Shut up!

622
00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:57.333
You have an effect on men.

623
00:49:00.124 --> 00:49:01.624
Why did you leave?

624
00:49:01.791 --> 00:49:03.499
Vincent was there, so...

625
00:49:03.666 --> 00:49:06.041
What do you want me to do?

626
00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:07.374
You're spying on me?

627
00:49:08.458 --> 00:49:09.708
You watch.

628
00:49:09.874 --> 00:49:11.458
Disaster?

629
00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:13.166
Rosalie!

630
00:49:14.499 --> 00:49:15.499
Rosalie!

631
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:18.124
Rosalie.

632
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:20.916
I don't want you
to see me like that.


633
00:49:21.874 --> 00:49:22.833
Come on, come on.

634
00:49:23.416 --> 00:49:24.291
Go away.

635
00:49:24.458 --> 00:49:27.166
Come on, come on.
I'll take you home.


636
00:49:28.041 --> 00:49:30.166
Come. Come on.

637
00:49:31.166 --> 00:49:32.416
Come on.

638
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.540
This is 'Diego'...
Meat in the fridge.


639
00:50:14.624 --> 00:50:18.041
Finished, the hairstyle of the
veiled king of spinning.


640
00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:20.666
Fundamentally chessy.

641
00:50:20.833 --> 00:50:22.583
No doubt, he's a bastard

642
00:50:22.749 --> 00:50:24.791
What are you hiding
Vincent Machot?


643
00:50:24.958 --> 00:50:26.458
Oh Oh Oh.

644
00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:28.124
Ho! Hey!

645
00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:30.708
These people have to work!
Who do you think you are


646
00:50:30.874 --> 00:50:31.791
With your lion?

647
00:50:31.958 --> 00:50:33.708
We also work.

648
00:50:33.874 --> 00:50:34.958
Come on, let's move.

649
00:50:35.124 --> 00:50:36.041
What?

650
00:50:36.208 --> 00:50:38.499
Don't tell me you
didn't understand?


651
00:50:38.666 --> 00:50:40.666
It's mother Machot, the key.

652
00:50:40.833 --> 00:50:43.124
We never see her.
Hey?


653
00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:45.666
The curtains are always closed.

654
00:50:45.833 --> 00:50:48.291
I called, no answer.
So what?


655
00:50:48.791 --> 00:50:50.208
Psychosis.

656
00:50:50.374 --> 00:50:52.541
Well, Hitchcock!
The mother's dead.


657
00:50:52.708 --> 00:50:54.291
Vincent pretends she's alive.

658
00:50:54.458 --> 00:50:56.833
As in Psychosis.
Okay.


659
00:50:56.999 --> 00:50:59.166
You've eaten
mushrooms or something?


660
00:50:59.333 --> 00:51:00.374
You're sick.

661
00:51:00.541 --> 00:51:02.499
And he's not a sick man?

662
00:51:02.666 --> 00:51:04.416
We need to find the evidence.

663
00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:07.249
What evidence?
He'll do the same with your aunt.


664
00:51:12.041 --> 00:51:13.874
And how do you intend to get in?
How?


665
00:51:14.041 --> 00:51:15.458
Look.
You be a lion.


666
00:51:15.624 --> 00:51:17.166
Lion. You idiot.

667
00:51:17.333 --> 00:51:19.958
You have a physique,
you don't use it.


668
00:51:20.124 --> 00:51:21.083
He roared.

669
00:51:21.249 --> 00:51:22.916
Do the lion.

670
00:51:24.999 --> 00:51:26.708
It's not important.

671
00:51:26.874 --> 00:51:29.124
Hold on.
There's no one, that's for sure?


672
00:51:29.291 --> 00:51:31.916
Certainly.
He freaks out, Arsene Lupine?


673
00:51:39.374 --> 00:51:42.416
You know what he says,
Arsene Lupine? Look.


674
00:52:05.999 --> 00:52:08.333
Don't touch anything.
Hey, oh...


675
00:52:08.499 --> 00:52:09.708
No but...

676
00:52:24.916 --> 00:52:26.083
Oh, Machot.

677
00:52:26.249 --> 00:52:28.833
Hairdresser perverts,
father and son.


678
00:52:28.999 --> 00:52:30.291
Hey!

679
00:52:36.083 --> 00:52:37.791
Bedroom!
It's there


680
00:52:37.958 --> 00:52:39.416
That must be where
he hides the corpse.


681
00:52:39.583 --> 00:52:41.083
Oh... stop.

682
00:52:41.249 --> 00:52:43.291
We'd better break up.

683
00:52:43.458 --> 00:52:44.791
Yeah!
But no.


684
00:52:44.958 --> 00:52:46.458
The sissies, the...

685
00:52:48.749 --> 00:52:49.874
I'm not sure.

686
00:52:51.208 --> 00:52:52.708
Ah, she freaked.

687
00:52:52.874 --> 00:52:54.333
No, I'm not scared.

688
00:53:08.333 --> 00:53:09.624
Don't push me.

689
00:53:24.791 --> 00:53:27.624
But who's this lunatic?

690
00:53:27.791 --> 00:53:29.208
Stop! Hold on!

691
00:53:30.624 --> 00:53:31.583
Let go of me!

692
00:53:31.749 --> 00:53:34.083
You guys!

693
00:53:34.249 --> 00:53:35.458
Oh shit.

694
00:53:36.958 --> 00:53:39.499
Catch them!
Thieves!


695
00:53:39.666 --> 00:53:41.708
The thieves!

696
00:53:41.874 --> 00:53:42.999
Assholes!

697
00:53:44.833 --> 00:53:47.291
I was conned into
believing your delusions.


698
00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:48.958
Hold on...
Frankly.


699
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:53.249
I'll give you one too,
right, because...


700
00:54:01.291 --> 00:54:03.208
What's wrong?
No.


701
00:54:03.374 --> 00:54:05.583
What's up with you?
Bah er...


702
00:54:07.166 --> 00:54:10.416
You mustn't laugh.
I wet my pants.


703
00:54:10.583 --> 00:54:13.041
Hey?
I was so scared that...


704
00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:15.833
I pissed myself.
What's the matter?


705
00:54:15.999 --> 00:54:17.083
What?

706
00:54:17.249 --> 00:54:19.999
She was so scared,
she pissed herself.


707
00:54:25.333 --> 00:54:27.124
Not easy, chick.

708
00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:28.916
Look.

709
00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:32.416
Maybe he is a yellow
jersey, actually.


710
00:54:33.624 --> 00:54:36.333
Did she really pee?
Yeah.


711
00:54:37.041 --> 00:54:39.291
I'd love to have seen that.

712
00:54:39.708 --> 00:54:41.374
You can't imagine the fear.

713
00:54:41.541 --> 00:54:42.499
I swear.

714
00:54:42.666 --> 00:54:45.458
With stuffed animals everywhere,
they were having tea.


715
00:54:45.624 --> 00:54:47.458
She shouted: 'Assholes!'

716
00:54:47.624 --> 00:54:50.124
Completely crazy.

717
00:54:50.291 --> 00:54:52.416
And I complain about my mother...

718
00:54:52.583 --> 00:54:55.208
He, poor man,
won the jackpot.


719
00:54:55.374 --> 00:54:57.874
She wasn't crazy, your mother.
Stop it.


720
00:54:58.041 --> 00:55:00.124
I swear she's crazy.

721
00:55:01.083 --> 00:55:03.041
You didn't know your grandmother...

722
00:55:04.541 --> 00:55:05.958
Otherwise you'd understand.

723
00:55:06.124 --> 00:55:07.374
She was bitchy?

724
00:55:07.541 --> 00:55:08.541
She was...

725
00:55:10.166 --> 00:55:11.458
Complicated.

726
00:55:12.791 --> 00:55:15.041
It must be the nature of mothers.

727
00:55:19.666 --> 00:55:20.791
And you?

728
00:55:21.416 --> 00:55:22.249
It's been a long time

729
00:55:22.416 --> 00:55:24.083
Since you saw Thomas?

730
00:55:26.166 --> 00:55:28.166
The last time he was little.

731
00:55:28.333 --> 00:55:30.333
I don't know what
he looks like.


732
00:55:32.208 --> 00:55:34.374
Hello, I want fruit.

733
00:55:34.541 --> 00:55:37.291
Don't remind me,
it brings back bad memories.


734
00:55:50.499 --> 00:55:52.624
Before I tell you who he was...

735
00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:54.791
You have...

736
00:55:55.999 --> 00:55:58.416
You hoped it was your
son, the follower?


737
00:56:04.083 --> 00:56:05.874
What, Vincent wants me?

738
00:56:06.958 --> 00:56:09.208
I just think he's bored.

739
00:56:10.041 --> 00:56:11.416
And I should know, eh.

740
00:56:12.333 --> 00:56:13.583
Me too.

741
00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:19.166
What if he was offered adventure?

742
00:56:20.083 --> 00:56:21.291
What do you think?

743
00:56:24.749 --> 00:56:25.916
He'll got some.

744
00:56:40.083 --> 00:56:40.916
Ah!

745
00:56:47.499 --> 00:56:49.749
It's okay, he's gone.

746
00:56:49.916 --> 00:56:52.208
Laughter

747
00:56:52.374 --> 00:56:54.374
Damn, I couldn't take it anymore.

748
00:56:57.041 --> 00:56:59.291
Bravo, you were great.

749
00:56:59.458 --> 00:57:00.916
You made me freak.

750
00:57:01.999 --> 00:57:03.749
What are we gonna do to him?

751
00:57:03.916 --> 00:57:05.499
I'll think about it.

752
00:57:06.166 --> 00:57:08.499
Can we put a camera
in the shower?


753
00:57:08.666 --> 00:57:10.749
Welcome to Cecile's
magical world.


754
00:57:10.916 --> 00:57:13.291
Does it pay well, hairdressing?
It could be better.


755
00:57:13.458 --> 00:57:15.041
And demand a ransom
from his mother.


756
00:57:15.208 --> 00:57:16.124
And welcome

757
00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:18.333
It's that flatmate.
He's not stupid.


758
00:57:18.499 --> 00:57:19.416
Of course.

759
00:57:19.583 --> 00:57:22.666
He wouldn't bite?
That was great.


760
00:57:52.416 --> 00:57:53.583
It's been three days.

761
00:57:53.749 --> 00:57:55.499
Maybe he's on vacation.

762
00:57:56.374 --> 00:57:59.041
What if it was because
of the other night?


763
00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:01.874
Would that have made him run away?
We mustn't exaggerate.


764
00:58:06.874 --> 00:58:08.374
Are you missing him?

765
00:58:08.541 --> 00:58:10.083
No it's not that.

766
00:58:11.708 --> 00:58:15.374
No, it's just that...
I enjoyed it all.


767
00:58:16.458 --> 00:58:17.666
It was exciting.

768
00:58:18.333 --> 00:58:19.666
Detective Aude.

769
00:58:19.833 --> 00:58:21.416
Haven't you got
better things to do?


770
00:58:22.833 --> 00:58:23.791
What?

771
00:58:25.249 --> 00:58:26.958
Labeling bottles?

772
00:58:27.124 --> 00:58:28.416
Arts Deco?

773
00:58:30.374 --> 00:58:32.708
I'm too old to compete.

774
00:58:32.874 --> 00:58:33.708
No.

775
00:58:33.874 --> 00:58:35.791
I inquired.

776
00:58:35.958 --> 00:58:39.041
I was sent an application form.

777
00:58:39.708 --> 00:58:40.666
Why?

778
00:58:41.249 --> 00:58:42.916
Because you're gifted.

779
00:58:44.374 --> 00:58:46.583
And because it makes me happy.

780
00:58:54.041 --> 00:58:55.166
Hello?

781
00:58:55.333 --> 00:58:57.999
It's me.
The idiot is back.


782
00:58:58.166 --> 00:58:59.291
He reopened the salon.

783
00:58:59.458 --> 00:59:00.416
Okay. Thank you.

784
00:59:02.208 --> 00:59:03.833
Vincent reopened the salon.

785
00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:06.624
Have a look, and smile?

786
00:59:23.624 --> 00:59:27.499
Hello, I want to make
an appointment for a blow dry.


787
00:59:27.999 --> 00:59:29.291
Wednesday?

788
00:59:30.499 --> 00:59:32.458
Wednesday, 3 pm, perfect.

789
00:59:33.749 --> 00:59:34.874
Rosalie Blum.

790
00:59:35.874 --> 00:59:36.958
B, L, U, M.

791
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:47.333
I love puzzles.

792
00:59:51.666 --> 00:59:55.041
The parts always end
up fitting perfectly.


793
00:59:56.333 --> 00:59:58.208
There's something
reassuring about it.


794
01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:07.833
When I had to move in, I
hesitated to go back to town.


795
01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:17.041
Perhaps I should have left.
But where could I go?


796
01:00:20.291 --> 01:00:22.916
I'm sick of 'I should have'.

797
01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:31.666
Every week I bring
them something.


798
01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:34.624
The important thing for
these girls is presence.


799
01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:35.708
A contact.

800
01:00:36.583 --> 01:00:37.749
A little warmth.

801
01:00:40.333 --> 01:00:43.374
If at that time nobody
had done it for me,


802
01:00:43.541 --> 01:00:46.458
Who knows what I
could have done?


803
01:00:46.624 --> 01:00:50.041
In prison, none of
my family visited me.


804
01:00:57.208 --> 01:01:00.458
I've been going to the
hairdresser for years.


805
01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:03.416
I do it myself.
Except today.


806
01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:06.249
Vincent Machot has
spiced my life,


807
01:01:06.416 --> 01:01:08.874
I was determined to
spice up his.


808
01:01:31.499 --> 01:01:32.541
Hello.

809
01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:37.708
Hello.

810
01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:40.166
I have an appointment
at 3 pm, Rosalie Blum.


811
01:01:41.124 --> 01:01:43.083
I... I was waiting for you.

812
01:01:44.124 --> 01:01:45.291
Let's go?

813
01:01:45.999 --> 01:01:46.958
Where?

814
01:01:50.083 --> 01:01:52.166
Um yes.

815
01:01:54.541 --> 01:01:56.291
I'll take your things.

816
01:02:18.291 --> 01:02:20.499
Don't you think it's cold?

817
01:02:21.416 --> 01:02:22.416
Yes.

818
01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.666
Yes, yes... It's true.

819
01:02:34.874 --> 01:02:35.958
Thank you.

820
01:02:37.083 --> 01:02:37.916
Goodbye.

821
01:02:38.499 --> 01:02:40.124
That's all?

822
01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:41.416
What do you mean?

823
01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:43.624
I'm not fine?

824
01:02:43.791 --> 01:02:45.999
Oh yes. Yes, that's fine.

825
01:02:47.541 --> 01:02:49.208
Good day then.

826
01:02:53.041 --> 01:02:54.958
Hello.
Hello.


827
01:02:55.124 --> 01:02:56.499
Good morning, Vincent.

828
01:02:57.458 --> 01:02:58.791
It's cold.

829
01:03:02.624 --> 01:03:03.999
Oh, this cold!

830
01:03:04.166 --> 01:03:06.124
I could have gone alone
to buy your waffle iron.


831
01:03:06.291 --> 01:03:08.916
You always say I
have to go out.


832
01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:11.499
And you might have made a mistake,
like with the alarm clock.


833
01:03:11.666 --> 01:03:13.499
Stop that, I was 12 years old.

834
01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:16.458
We laughed so much!
No. I was punished.


835
01:03:16.624 --> 01:03:19.333
You told Dad...
That you were forgetful.


836
01:03:19.499 --> 01:03:21.666
So that... Yes, that...

837
01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:23.791
The only child capable of...

838
01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:25.374
Messing up an alarm clock...

839
01:03:26.374 --> 01:03:27.458
You know her?

840
01:03:28.124 --> 01:03:29.041
No.

841
01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:31.416
But look,
where are you going!


842
01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:35.166
Be careful, you bastard!

843
01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:36.458
Ah, no!

844
01:03:36.624 --> 01:03:38.708
What am I going
to do with you?'


845
01:03:40.124 --> 01:03:41.083
Vincent!

846
01:03:43.166 --> 01:03:44.041
Vincent...

847
01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.583
You're going to make him crazy,
meeting him everywhere like that.


848
01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:03.083
You shouldn't hurt him.

849
01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:07.874
Hurt him?

850
01:04:09.624 --> 01:04:11.291
We're having a little fun.

851
01:04:11.958 --> 01:04:12.874
It doesn't happen often.

852
01:04:20.833 --> 01:04:22.958
We'll drop it off at
the end of the week.


853
01:04:28.124 --> 01:04:30.083
I think by chance?'

854
01:04:31.791 --> 01:04:33.708
Not at all. Why?

855
01:04:33.874 --> 01:04:35.374
I dunno. Like that.

856
01:04:35.541 --> 01:04:36.499
Po, po, po...

857
01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:38.499
Oh oh!

858
01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:39.499
No.

859
01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:41.333
Nothing happens without reason.

860
01:04:41.499 --> 01:04:43.416
We'll pull the strings,
if you'd rather.


861
01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:45.833
Oh, come on.
Yes of course!


862
01:04:45.999 --> 01:04:48.416
On Saturday, I'm going to a
concert with Anna.


863
01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:51.958
Mathilde will be there.
She's... great.


864
01:04:52.124 --> 01:04:53.124
Great?

865
01:04:53.291 --> 01:04:55.541
On Saturday, I want
to introduce her to you.


866
01:04:58.333 --> 01:04:59.166
What?

867
01:05:01.791 --> 01:05:03.624
Why are you scared of everything?

868
01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:06.541
You weren't like that, kid.

869
01:05:15.624 --> 01:05:17.208
Watch out, eh.

870
01:05:17.374 --> 01:05:20.499
There are some who end up
playing all their lives with dolls.


871
01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:22.458
What is wrong with you?

872
01:05:23.791 --> 01:05:25.833
Hey, come back!
You're afraid!


873
01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:29.708
Madame Blum!

874
01:05:34.791 --> 01:05:35.624
Hello.

875
01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:37.208
Hello.

876
01:05:39.124 --> 01:05:41.208
Why do you do that?

877
01:05:41.374 --> 01:05:43.333
Why do I do what?
Well, that's it.


878
01:05:43.499 --> 01:05:45.249
I keep running into you.

879
01:05:45.416 --> 01:05:47.291
I know it's no coincidence.

880
01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:48.291
You think?

881
01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:51.291
What are you looking for?

882
01:05:51.458 --> 01:05:54.708
It's for me to ask
you that, Vincent Machot.


883
01:05:55.749 --> 01:05:58.249
You know my name?
For some time.


884
01:05:58.416 --> 01:06:00.416
You followed me everywhere.

885
01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:03.333
Not at all.
Yes.


886
01:06:03.499 --> 01:06:04.458
No.

887
01:06:04.624 --> 01:06:07.416
At the grocery store, to my
home, to the choir,


888
01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:09.208
At the club. Everywhere.

889
01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:13.166
I'm sorry.
It's not what you think.


890
01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:14.583
Don't apologize.

891
01:06:15.583 --> 01:06:17.083
I did the same.

892
01:06:17.249 --> 01:06:18.124
Huh?

893
01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:19.999
What have you done?

894
01:06:20.166 --> 01:06:21.708
Followed.

895
01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:25.124
I followed you.
Well, not me. She did.


896
01:06:32.583 --> 01:06:34.791
I present Aude.
My niece.


897
01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:37.541
She's been spying
on you for weeks.


898
01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:40.916
Hello.

899
01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:43.999
Hello.

900
01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.208
Ah.

901
01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:46.833
Apparently,

902
01:06:46.999 --> 01:06:49.041
She was more discreet than you.

903
01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:54.249
It's okay?

904
01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:57.333
Are you okay?

905
01:06:57.499 --> 01:06:59.791
You want me to call a doctor?

906
01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:02.791
But wait!

907
01:07:07.374 --> 01:07:08.416
Good...

908
01:07:08.999 --> 01:07:10.666
He looks so bad.

909
01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.749
We didn't do anything serious?

910
01:07:14.708 --> 01:07:15.916
It's you, too.

911
01:07:16.916 --> 01:07:18.749
What did you need?

912
01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:21.166
I told you, we took
him for a fool!


913
01:07:22.666 --> 01:07:25.416
For once something
happens to you.


914
01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.541
You see, a little something.

915
01:07:27.708 --> 01:07:29.291
Do you see what you're doing?

916
01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:26.708
Can I sleep with you?

917
01:08:26.874 --> 01:08:28.666
What.

918
01:08:31.208 --> 01:08:32.833
What's wrong?

919
01:09:35.916 --> 01:09:39.249
I thought that at your home,
you couldn't run away.


920
01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:42.124
Oh, Rocky, come here!

921
01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:43.541
Come here!

922
01:09:43.708 --> 01:09:44.874
Rocky, come on!

923
01:09:45.041 --> 01:09:45.874
Come on!

924
01:09:48.249 --> 01:09:49.541
Come on.

925
01:09:56.124 --> 01:09:58.208
What's this noise?
Hello.


926
01:09:58.374 --> 01:09:59.333
No but...

927
01:09:59.499 --> 01:10:01.708
Say, you could kiss me.

928
01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:04.624
No but!

929
01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:06.749
What's wrong with you?

930
01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:08.208
Who is it?

931
01:10:08.374 --> 01:10:09.208
Uh...

932
01:10:09.374 --> 01:10:11.208
Vincent... There!

933
01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:14.208
It's one of the chicks!
Hey?


934
01:10:14.374 --> 01:10:17.041
Her gang came into my house
and pissed.


935
01:10:17.208 --> 01:10:19.416
Go home, I'll come
and see you later.


936
01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:20.624
Vincent!

937
01:10:20.791 --> 01:10:21.749
Vincent.

938
01:10:21.916 --> 01:10:24.249
Vincent, you open this door!

939
01:10:24.416 --> 01:10:25.999
You really went to her house?

940
01:10:26.166 --> 01:10:27.833
What are you doing
with this thief?


941
01:10:27.999 --> 01:10:30.499
It's not her.
Yes, I recognize her.


942
01:10:30.666 --> 01:10:31.541
You're wrong.

943
01:10:31.708 --> 01:10:32.833
Go home.

944
01:10:32.999 --> 01:10:34.458
I'm not crazy.

945
01:10:34.624 --> 01:10:36.041
I'm not crazy, huh!

946
01:10:36.208 --> 01:10:38.624
Who's this girl?
A friend.


947
01:10:38.791 --> 01:10:41.499
Leave me alone.
I'll come later.


948
01:10:41.666 --> 01:10:42.583
A friend?

949
01:10:42.749 --> 01:10:45.208
I've never been so ashamed.
I swear...


950
01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.083
You come to see me, eh.

951
01:10:48.958 --> 01:10:50.041
Why

952
01:10:50.208 --> 01:10:52.708
You went to my mother's house?
To understand you.


953
01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:54.749
At my mum's house?
No but...


954
01:10:54.916 --> 01:10:57.291
As we never saw her,
stupidly...


955
01:10:57.458 --> 01:10:58.874
We wanted to see if she existed.

956
01:10:59.041 --> 01:11:01.416
She exists.

957
01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:02.416
I believe you.

958
01:11:02.583 --> 01:11:05.458
When she surprised us,
she was wearing a crown.


959
01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:10.291
I'll be back.

960
01:11:10.999 --> 01:11:12.333
And you?

961
01:11:12.499 --> 01:11:14.708
Why did you follow my aunt?

962
01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:20.624
I...

963
01:11:21.499 --> 01:11:22.708
I dunno.

964
01:11:22.874 --> 01:11:24.208
It was stupid.

965
01:11:25.791 --> 01:11:29.083
The first time at the grocery store,
I thought I'd seen her before.


966
01:11:29.249 --> 01:11:30.291
And then it got me...

967
01:11:33.333 --> 01:11:35.791
I saw her again and I...

968
01:11:39.166 --> 01:11:40.499
I'm really coming back.

969
01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:32.583
It's beautiful, all that.

970
01:12:33.666 --> 01:12:35.374
Do you make them?

971
01:12:35.666 --> 01:12:36.874
Yeah.

972
01:12:37.541 --> 01:12:38.624
Oh yeah.

973
01:12:40.166 --> 01:12:42.791
That one, it's my favorite.

974
01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:43.958
Me too.

975
01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:47.458
By the way...

976
01:12:48.791 --> 01:12:50.374
It's yours. It was

977
01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:51.458
in the woods.

978
01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:58.041
You must have laughed
that evening.


979
01:13:03.666 --> 01:13:06.874
And I brought you this, too.

980
01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:12.249
With Rosalie, we had
planned to give it to you.


981
01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:15.208
We wanted to meet you for real.

982
01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:23.416
I'm not sure that was a good idea.

983
01:13:30.916 --> 01:13:33.416
You know, your aunt...

984
01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:36.208
I may have never seen her.

985
01:13:36.999 --> 01:13:40.791
I think she intrigued me.
She looked so lonely.


986
01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:43.458
And so sad, too.

987
01:14:10.916 --> 01:14:11.958
You're hungry?

988
01:14:12.833 --> 01:14:14.583
You'll see, it's excellent.

989
01:14:14.749 --> 01:14:16.833
It was here that
I invited your brother


990
01:14:16.999 --> 01:14:19.041
When he was admitted to the bar.

991
01:14:19.208 --> 01:14:21.208
Do you like oysters?
No.


992
01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.499
Oh no? Oh yes, no.

993
01:14:25.083 --> 01:14:28.374
Take what you want.
You have to eat.


994
01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:29.999
You're not very chubby.

995
01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:33.791
You still have a lot of work?

996
01:14:36.749 --> 01:14:38.916
It's been a year
since I quit college.


997
01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:41.374
Apart from bullshit,
I don't work.


998
01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:44.374
I decided to take the
Arts Deco contest.


999
01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:49.583
A bottle of Chablis.

1000
01:14:49.749 --> 01:14:51.833
I'll bring it to you right away.

1001
01:14:51.999 --> 01:14:54.374
Good then...
Do you want to sign up?


1002
01:14:55.249 --> 01:14:57.041
I didn't want to see you for that.

1003
01:14:57.208 --> 01:14:58.916
Why, then?

1004
01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:00.166
For Rosalie.

1005
01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:03.249
Who?
Rosalie. Mum's sister.


1006
01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.624
I want you to tell me.

1007
01:15:07.999 --> 01:15:09.249
It's horrible.

1008
01:15:10.083 --> 01:15:12.708
It makes me want to
cry, your story.


1009
01:15:12.874 --> 01:15:14.999
I knew you'd say that.

1010
01:15:17.041 --> 01:15:18.666
It's disgusting.

1011
01:15:18.833 --> 01:15:21.291
There's a lot of young
people who are rubbish.


1012
01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:24.958
You hang out with bad
people and you're hooked.


1013
01:15:25.124 --> 01:15:27.416
Six years, it's huge
for a burglary.


1014
01:15:27.583 --> 01:15:30.291
It was messed up, there
were some dead.


1015
01:15:30.916 --> 01:15:32.124
Who were these people?

1016
01:15:32.291 --> 01:15:34.374
Neighbors of my grandparents.

1017
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:36.833
My mother was
babysitting at home.


1018
01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:39.416
Rosalie stuck their
key in her bag.


1019
01:15:40.333 --> 01:15:43.374
She went with guys
and it went wrong.


1020
01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:45.791
Fuck, I'll smoke it.

1021
01:15:47.249 --> 01:15:49.291
That ruined her life.
That's crazy!


1022
01:15:49.458 --> 01:15:50.583
Don't be mad.

1023
01:15:50.749 --> 01:15:52.624
Well, I'm getting nervous.

1024
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:55.166
She's great, your aunt.

1025
01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:02.041
Hello, the atmosphere.

1026
01:16:02.208 --> 01:16:03.749
Thanks for lifting my morale.

1027
01:16:03.916 --> 01:16:05.291
What now?

1028
01:16:05.458 --> 01:16:07.666
This dog is a shit of a lion.

1029
01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:54.124
Surprise.

1030
01:16:54.874 --> 01:16:57.249
You came to see your
auntie all alone?


1031
01:16:58.791 --> 01:17:00.583
Very truly alone.

1032
01:17:00.999 --> 01:17:01.833
Tada!

1033
01:17:03.124 --> 01:17:04.958
I present Miranda to you.

1034
01:17:05.124 --> 01:17:06.333
Merry Christmas.

1035
01:17:07.624 --> 01:17:09.416
It's for me?
Well yeah.


1036
01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:12.499
If you don't want her,
don't worry, I'll take her back.


1037
01:17:12.666 --> 01:17:15.458
My flatmate wanted
to make her a lion...


1038
01:17:17.291 --> 01:17:20.499
I told myself that now that
Vincent no longer follows you,


1039
01:17:20.666 --> 01:17:23.541
Maybe she would make you happy.

1040
01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:26.416
Show me your head.

1041
01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:28.541
Oh, you look nice, you.

1042
01:17:28.708 --> 01:17:29.833
Oh yes...

1043
01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:35.791
Don't you have a New Year's
Eve party with your parents?


1044
01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:37.833
Yes, but it sucks.

1045
01:17:39.666 --> 01:17:43.041
I've already reached my
mother-limit, so the...


1046
01:17:45.041 --> 01:17:46.791
She rejected you.

1047
01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:52.624
My father told me, I asked him.

1048
01:17:56.041 --> 01:17:57.833
It's ancient history.

1049
01:17:59.666 --> 01:18:00.874
She makes me laugh

1050
01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:02.958
With moral lessons.

1051
01:18:05.041 --> 01:18:08.124
My sister went to prison,
I don't let her down.


1052
01:18:11.333 --> 01:18:13.499
We weren't that close.

1053
01:18:14.249 --> 01:18:15.958
We were very different.

1054
01:18:16.374 --> 01:18:17.333
So what?

1055
01:18:18.416 --> 01:18:20.374
It wasn't easy for her.

1056
01:18:21.416 --> 01:18:24.666
I made it hard for them.
I was doing anything.


1057
01:18:26.249 --> 01:18:30.083
When I was in prison, she found
herself alone with our parents.


1058
01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:35.416
Shame, sorrow, gossip.

1059
01:18:37.333 --> 01:18:39.374
I want more than you think.

1060
01:18:45.666 --> 01:18:46.583
Thank you.

1061
01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:49.708
Wait until he's eaten your sofa.

1062
01:18:49.874 --> 01:18:53.166
No. Thank you for coming.
It touches me deeply.


1063
01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:02.791
Can I ... ask you a
question about Thomas?


1064
01:19:07.499 --> 01:19:10.124
After the prison, didn't
you try to find him?


1065
01:19:10.291 --> 01:19:11.333
I found him.

1066
01:19:15.874 --> 01:19:17.916
I didn't dare to approach him.

1067
01:19:19.833 --> 01:19:22.749
He looked happy with
his host family.


1068
01:19:22.916 --> 01:19:24.041
Perhaps...

1069
01:19:28.833 --> 01:19:30.958
It made me think.

1070
01:19:31.124 --> 01:19:32.874
I didn't have the strength.

1071
01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.916
Do you ever want to see him again?

1072
01:19:44.041 --> 01:19:45.708
I have his address.

1073
01:19:49.249 --> 01:19:53.208
I try to write to him...
My letters end up in the trash.


1074
01:20:18.958 --> 01:20:20.166
Oh!

1075
01:20:20.333 --> 01:20:22.291
Oh, a waffle iron... so!

1076
01:20:22.458 --> 01:20:24.333
It's handsome.
What a nice surprise!


1077
01:20:24.499 --> 01:20:25.916
Congratulations, darling.

1078
01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:27.291
It's exactly

1079
01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:28.499
what I wanted.

1080
01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:32.083
I've already told you the story...

1081
01:20:32.249 --> 01:20:35.374
Of Vincent and the awakening?
Stop that!


1082
01:20:35.541 --> 01:20:36.958
Oh, you're not funny.

1083
01:20:40.249 --> 01:20:42.333
Wasn't it daddy's, this sweater?

1084
01:20:43.458 --> 01:20:44.666
Well, why?

1085
01:20:45.249 --> 01:20:46.374
Try it.

1086
01:20:46.916 --> 01:20:48.791
It's superb, isn't it?
Great.


1087
01:20:48.958 --> 01:20:50.499
It'll fit like a glove.

1088
01:20:50.666 --> 01:20:53.541
It'll go especially
well with my Oedipus complex.


1089
01:20:53.708 --> 01:20:55.124
What's this bullshit?

1090
01:20:55.291 --> 01:20:57.249
Anyone want coffee?
Yes.


1091
01:20:57.416 --> 01:20:58.499
Yes me too.

1092
01:20:58.666 --> 01:21:01.166
Of course it's
nice bullshit.


1093
01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:03.291
Our mother-son relationship

1094
01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:05.833
It's quite healthy?
Perfectly.


1095
01:21:07.166 --> 01:21:11.249
If I spend time with you, is
it because we get along well?


1096
01:21:11.416 --> 01:21:14.541
Yes, it's fortunate,
a collaboration.


1097
01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:18.708
Do you think it's
all right, my life


1098
01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.833
And that I look happy?

1099
01:21:20.999 --> 01:21:23.958
Happy?
Happy? What does it mean?


1100
01:21:24.124 --> 01:21:26.416
Sounds like a women's magazine.

1101
01:21:26.583 --> 01:21:28.499
Am I happy?

1102
01:21:28.666 --> 01:21:30.624
You have inherited
your father's things,


1103
01:21:30.791 --> 01:21:33.083
You have your apartment,
you're independent.


1104
01:21:33.249 --> 01:21:35.458
You can do your thing.

1105
01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:36.833
What else do you want?

1106
01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:39.749
That's true.

1107
01:21:43.124 --> 01:21:44.541
Merry Christmas, Mum.

1108
01:21:48.874 --> 01:21:50.208
Go ahead, my champion!

1109
01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:53.083
Where are you going?
Vincent?


1110
01:21:53.874 --> 01:21:55.458
Bah... bah, Vincent?

1111
01:22:07.749 --> 01:22:08.583
Hello?

1112
01:22:09.624 --> 01:22:10.666
Aude?

1113
01:22:10.833 --> 01:22:14.041
Hello, it's Vincent...
Vincent Machot.


1114
01:22:14.208 --> 01:22:15.416
Oh, hello.

1115
01:22:15.583 --> 01:22:18.249
A meeting, it...

1116
01:22:18.416 --> 01:22:19.958
Is it still OK?

1117
01:22:20.499 --> 01:22:21.624
Yeah!

1118
01:22:22.708 --> 01:22:24.499
Yes, of course... Uh...

1119
01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:26.499
You...

1120
01:22:27.249 --> 01:22:29.166
What are you doing
for New Year?


1121
01:22:53.291 --> 01:22:56.291
I'm glad to see you,
Vincent Machot.


1122
01:22:57.499 --> 01:22:58.583
Me too.

1123
01:23:01.833 --> 01:23:03.416
Thank you.

1124
01:23:11.083 --> 01:23:12.749
I'll get you a drink.

1125
01:23:14.624 --> 01:23:16.208
Hello.
Hello.


1126
01:23:17.124 --> 01:23:19.124
You found it easily?

1127
01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:21.208
Bah...
I'm joking.


1128
01:23:21.374 --> 01:23:23.833
OK.
Hello. How are you bro?


1129
01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:25.999
Welcome.

1130
01:23:26.166 --> 01:23:27.083
Hello.

1131
01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:30.958
He's my flatmate.
He almost kissed me.


1132
01:23:32.041 --> 01:23:33.958
Vincent Machot
Vincent Machot


1133
01:23:34.124 --> 01:23:36.249
In the end you get nothing
from a beautiful bastard.


1134
01:23:36.416 --> 01:23:37.666
Stop, you're serious.

1135
01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:59.041
I don't know how to dance.
But we don't care.


1136
01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:07.583
Hold on.

1137
01:24:11.166 --> 01:24:13.249
No, I'm not photogenic!

1138
01:24:13.416 --> 01:24:14.791
It's not true.

1139
01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:25.916
Are you going to send a picture of me?
Many.


1140
01:24:26.083 --> 01:24:29.374
What do you mean?
They want personal work.


1141
01:24:29.541 --> 01:24:32.458
With the pictures, I would
like to write some text.


1142
01:24:32.624 --> 01:24:35.124
So I'll tell the whole story.

1143
01:24:35.291 --> 01:24:36.999
I'll call it The Unknown.

1144
01:24:37.166 --> 01:24:39.666
Or maybe the Rosalie Blum case.

1145
01:24:39.833 --> 01:24:42.416
But they will be published?

1146
01:24:42.583 --> 01:24:43.416
Ah well, yes.

1147
01:24:43.583 --> 01:24:45.458
In 4 x 3, at all the stations.

1148
01:24:46.416 --> 01:24:50.624
But I'm joking! Just testing
the jury of Arts Deco.


1149
01:24:50.791 --> 01:24:53.166
As they attach importance to

1150
01:24:53.333 --> 01:24:55.499
To the originality,
I thought that...


1151
01:24:55.666 --> 01:24:57.041
I agree.

1152
01:24:58.249 --> 01:25:00.208
Really?
Yeah.


1153
01:25:04.249 --> 01:25:05.291
Hey, man!

1154
01:25:06.208 --> 01:25:07.124
Come back in,

1155
01:25:07.291 --> 01:25:10.583
It'll soon be midnight!
Oh damn, it's snowing!


1156
01:25:10.749 --> 01:25:12.541
We're gonna ruin them.
Yeah.


1157
01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:17.583
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0!

1158
01:25:17.749 --> 01:25:19.291
Cheers

1159
01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:22.249
Happy New Year.
Yeah... good year.


1160
01:25:26.333 --> 01:25:28.291
Is this what we want?

1161
01:25:35.708 --> 01:25:37.624
No, you're not bleeding.

1162
01:26:05.708 --> 01:26:07.208
Stop it, Miranda.

1163
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:18.958
What are you doing today?

1164
01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:21.999
Would you like to go to the sea?

1165
01:26:22.166 --> 01:26:24.958
It's been ten years
since I saw the sea.


1166
01:26:25.124 --> 01:26:26.874
I have my old Peugeot in the garage.

1167
01:26:27.041 --> 01:26:28.333
She needs an outing.

1168
01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:31.749
In three hours, we'll be there.

1169
01:26:31.916 --> 01:26:33.249
Well yeah.
OK.


1170
01:26:33.416 --> 01:26:34.874
Yeah?
Yeah!


1171
01:26:43.791 --> 01:26:45.791
That will be five euros.

1172
01:26:48.833 --> 01:26:50.416
Thank you very much!

1173
01:26:50.583 --> 01:26:52.458
Thank you, goodbye.

1174
01:26:56.041 --> 01:26:57.249
You want a fry?
No.


1175
01:26:57.416 --> 01:26:59.041
We got some sauce.

1176
01:26:59.874 --> 01:27:02.249
I'm going to walk my wildcat.

1177
01:27:02.416 --> 01:27:04.124
Oh, that's hot.

1178
01:27:05.041 --> 01:27:06.708
Right away.
Okay.


1179
01:27:06.874 --> 01:27:09.124
Yeah, I was...
It's hot?


1180
01:29:09.958 --> 01:29:11.083
Vincent!

1181
01:29:13.541 --> 01:29:14.916
I'm sorry...

1182
01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:49.240
Vincent, aged 10 years.

1183
01:29:55.874 --> 01:29:58.999
I met Vincent's
mistress at the market.


1184
01:29:59.166 --> 01:30:02.666
Your son didn't tell us
he was punished. Oh yeah?


1185
01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:06.583
I must not send notes in class.

1186
01:30:06.749 --> 01:30:08.541
Conjugate in all tenses.

1187
01:30:12.541 --> 01:30:14.208
Dear Blandine...

1188
01:30:14.374 --> 01:30:16.249
Dear without 'e',
it starts well.


1189
01:30:16.416 --> 01:30:19.124
Every morning I come
to school for you.


1190
01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:21.374
To look at you or talk to you.

1191
01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:23.833
Blandine, you're
beautiful as a flower.


1192
01:30:23.999 --> 01:30:27.124
You smell as good as a lemon.
Bravo for the rhyme.


1193
01:30:27.291 --> 01:30:29.833
I love you.
Will you be my lover?


1194
01:30:29.999 --> 01:30:32.208
Vincent.
Shh, I'm listening to the TV.


1195
01:30:34.166 --> 01:30:37.458
After the arrest on
Tuesday of two vagrants,


1196
01:30:37.624 --> 01:30:40.333
It was in the middle of the
day that they were arrested here,


1197
01:30:40.499 --> 01:30:41.624
In the house,

1198
01:30:41.791 --> 01:30:44.416
The youngest daughter of
the family, aged 20 years.


1199
01:30:44.583 --> 01:30:45.916
A lover?

1200
01:30:48.416 --> 01:30:49.374
Give it to me!

1201
01:30:50.333 --> 01:30:52.708
You're not at school to do that.
Give it!


1202
01:30:53.708 --> 01:30:55.333
She was arrested.

1203
01:30:55.499 --> 01:30:57.499
From now on,

1204
01:30:57.666 --> 01:31:00.708
To shed light on what
could have happened


1205
01:31:00.874 --> 01:31:03.416
During this burglary
that became dramatic


1206
01:31:03.583 --> 01:31:05.124
Following the return
of the owners.


1207
01:31:05.833 --> 01:31:07.041
It is necesary to determine

1208
01:31:07.249 --> 01:31:10.916
The responsibility
of each participant.


1209
01:31:11.083 --> 01:31:13.958
Rosalie is currently
being interviewed...
