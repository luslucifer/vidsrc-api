00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:19.535
Danger!
One minute 'til meteor impact!


2
00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:23.173
Danger! Seek shelter!

3
00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:25.141
One minute 'til meteor impact!

4
00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:27.110
Won't some superhero save us?

5
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.313
We need more than one.
We need...


6
00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:31.414
Them!

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.086
Thundermans, reporting for duty.

8
00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:39.389
Glad they finally saw us.

9
00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.025
Right? We've been holding
this pose for three minutes.


10
00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:44.828
Okay, T-Force, we got meteors,
coming in hot!


11
00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:45.962
Say your name and fan out.

12
00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:47.297
Why do we need to say our names?

13
00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.365
'Cause it looks great
in the highlight reel.


14
00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:53.436
Thunder Man!

15
00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:54.805

19
00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:02.278
Can I get a new name?

20
00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:03.747
Thunder Girl!

21
00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:06.049
And-
- Wait, what's my cool name?

22
00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.684
Max, flaming space chunks.

23
00:01:07.784 --> 00:01:09.753
And Max Flaming Space Chunks!

24
00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.088
All right, guys,
as your co-captains,


25
00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:13.489
Phoebe and I will take
the first wave.


26
00:01:13.589 --> 00:01:14.590
Stand by for orders.

27
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:15.591
Here they come!

28
00:01:18.594 --> 00:01:20.363
You did not just snap a selfie!

29
00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:23.433
Phoebe, I know exactly how much
time I have until--


30
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:24.968
Meteor.

31
00:01:25.568 --> 00:01:26.870
Whoa!

32
00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:32.608
This one's all me!

33
00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:37.848
You got incoming, Nora!

34
00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:39.582
I know, I have eyes.

35
00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:41.217
Laser eyes.

36
00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:46.389
Stand behind me, Chloe.

37
00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:48.859
Eat lightning, space rock!

38
00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:57.333
"Eat lightning," Barb?
I like it!


39
00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.503
I know, right?
It just came to me!


40
00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:01.872
Here comes the mama bear.

41
00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:04.707
- Dad!
- Dad!


42
00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:06.242
Billy, set a perimeter.

43
00:02:06.342 --> 00:02:07.844
On it!

44
00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:09.179
What's a perimeter?

45
00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.681
The thing with the cones
that keeps people back.


46
00:02:11.782 --> 00:02:13.649
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got you.

47
00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:18.454
- Steady, Dad.
- You got this.


48
00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:23.359
Welcome to Earth.
Try the punch!


49
00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:35.138
Come on, guys. 
Let's go home.

50
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.144
- Max, you should probably--
- You're in my light, Billy.


51
00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:42.979
Max, you might wanna--

52
00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.048
I'm kind of busy, Nora!

53
00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:46.817
Are we just gonna leave
without telling him?


54
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.318
Absolutely.

55
00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:56.759
You guys could have warned me.

56
00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:21.584
Ah, great day, guys!

57
00:03:21.684 --> 00:03:24.320
We made the world safer.
Isn't that what it's all about?


58
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.457
All right, Maxinators.
That's today's livestream.


59
00:03:27.557 --> 00:03:29.926
Sorry there was so much Phoebe!

60
00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:31.561
Stay awesome.

61
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:34.297
And don't forget to smash
that heart button.


62
00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:36.232
I'll smash that heart button.

63
00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:38.969

Billy, it's the same photo.

67
00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:51.781
We don't live a double life
anymore.


68
00:03:51.882 --> 00:03:53.283
I know that.

69
00:03:54.017 --> 00:03:56.086
Why didn't you tell me?

70
00:03:57.087 --> 00:03:58.821
All right, guys,

71
00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:00.957
who's excited for Family Night?

72
00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:02.859
- Yay, Family Night!
- Mom, sounds great.


73
00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.062
Can't wait. Right after a quick
mission review sesh.


74
00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.864
- Oh.
- Aww.


75
00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:10.800
Mission review... now?

76
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:13.403
Can't it wait, Phoebe?
We haven't had a Family Night


77
00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.805
since you two brought us on
to the T-Force.


78
00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:17.874
Guys, it'll be quick,
I promise.


79
00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:19.675
There's just 27 things.

80
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.278
Okay, uh, Nora,

81
00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:24.981
try ricocheting your eye lasers
to give them more power.


82
00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:26.449
Oh, like this?

83
00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.753
Now it's Family Night!

84
00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:33.256
I'll start the Thunder chili!

85
00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:34.324
I'll get the scrapbook.

86
00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:35.791
And I'll get the board games.

87
00:04:35.892 --> 00:04:38.194
Okay, great review sesh.

88

One, two, three.

89
00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.368
- Your turn, Phoebe.
- Check it out.


90
00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:47.971
This blog says I'm a cinch
for "Superhero of the Year."


91

Skipping Phoebe. Max's turn.

Hey, Nora.

96
00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.051
Do you want to videochat
with our new friends tonight?


97
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:04.454
We don't have any friends here.
All we do is fight villains.


98
00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.389
What about those kids
we hung out with last week?


99
00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:08.758
That was Squid Man
and his evil hench-squids.


100
00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:12.295
No wonder they kept
spitting ink at me.


101
00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:17.167
Oh, isn't this nice, Hank?

102
00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:20.770
We finally get a night
of being a regular family.


103
00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:22.973
Everything okay down there?

104
00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:24.774
No, it's been three years

105
00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:27.377
and I still can't get
a good butt groove going.

"Crime" is a little strong.

108
00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.517
He's just rubbing his butt
into the couch.


109
00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:36.987
No, Mom,
he means an actual crime.


110
00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.321

some after-hours withdrawals.

Family Night chili!

00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:10.039
Oh!

163
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.807
Anyone got a clear shot?

164
00:08:11.907 --> 00:08:13.309
I sure do!

165
00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:15.411
Sky selfie!

166
00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:18.248
I got photobombed
by the V-Team.


167
00:08:18.348 --> 00:08:19.515
The V
-Team?

168
00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:21.417
V
-Team! Ready...

169
00:08:21.517 --> 00:08:23.153
- ...For...
- ...Action!


170
00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.722
Whoa, it's really them!

171
00:08:26.822 --> 00:08:27.823
Hey, guys!

172
00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:32.828
V-Team, stand down.
This is our mission.


173
00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.799
You look tired.
We'll take it from here.


174
00:08:36.899 --> 00:08:39.502
And steal our glory?
I don't think so.


175
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.704
Yeah, we're not sharing credit

176
00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:44.006
with a bunch of light-up
super-zeroes.


177
00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:45.541
Nora, fire when ready.

178
00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:48.744
That suit looks like
it's laser-resistant.


179
00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:51.814
Just do it!
We are not losing this.


180
00:08:51.914 --> 00:08:54.417
If the blast gets repelled,
no telling where it will go.


181
00:08:54.517 --> 00:08:56.886
Guys, V-Team's closing in.
Quit stalling!


182
00:08:56.986 --> 00:08:58.988
Nora, take the shot!
That's an order!


183
00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:03.526
Whoa-oh-oh!

184
00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:10.433
Whoa-oh!

185
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.442
Ow?

186
00:09:25.415 --> 00:09:26.982
Plasma blast!

187
00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:33.523
Villain down.
No need to thank us.


188
00:09:37.293 --> 00:09:38.561
Whoa-oh!

189
00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:41.597
Come on, let's go.

190
00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:53.576
Okay, so things got
a little messy.


191
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.778
We crushed someone
with a giant donut!


192
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:57.847
My follower count.

193
00:09:57.947 --> 00:10:00.350
My Maximillions are down
to Maxithousands!


194
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.652
Plus Family Night was ruined.

195
00:10:02.752 --> 00:10:05.054
- Mom, this is serious.
- Quit joking around!


196
00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:09.024
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>
<i>President Kickbutt approaching!</i>


197
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:12.762
Oh, relax. I'm sure she hasn't
heard what happened.


198
00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:15.731
I heard what happened!

199
00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:18.768
In light of this evening's
events,


200
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.404
I'm afraid the T-Force
is hereby...


201
00:10:21.504 --> 00:10:22.572
decommissioned.

202
00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:24.106
Thanks, Your Highness.

203
00:10:24.574 --> 00:10:25.641
Billy, that means we're fired.

204
00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:28.010
Not cool, Your Highness.

205
00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:30.413
Are you serious?

206
00:10:30.513 --> 00:10:32.248
But the T-Force is
the most successful team


207
00:10:32.348 --> 00:10:33.516
in Hero League history.

208
00:10:33.616 --> 00:10:36.051
The rules say
anyone who injures a supe


209
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:37.287
in the line of duty

210
00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:38.521
must be fired.

211
00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:40.423
But the V-Team
crashed our mission.


212
00:10:40.523 --> 00:10:42.425
They caught the perp!

213
00:10:42.525 --> 00:10:44.760
You knocked over
a two-ton donut.


214
00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:47.497
Unbelievable.

215
00:10:47.597 --> 00:10:49.699
Good luck finding a team
that can replace us.


216
00:10:52.034 --> 00:10:53.503
V
-Team, reporting...

217
00:10:53.603 --> 00:10:54.837
- ...For...
- ...Duty.


218
00:10:54.937 --> 00:10:57.307
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

219
00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:58.708
They're new,

220
00:10:58.808 --> 00:11:00.810
but their success
has been remarkable.


221
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.846
And they can really rock.

222
00:11:03.946 --> 00:11:05.648
Yeah, they can!

223
00:11:06.215 --> 00:11:08.618
Ow! You know it's true.

224
00:11:09.352 --> 00:11:10.553
Thundermans,

225
00:11:10.653 --> 00:11:13.122
we have some mighty big
super-shoes to fill.


226
00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:16.292
Come on, team.
Let's help them pack their junk.


227
00:11:16.392 --> 00:11:18.794
- Oh, hold me back.
- No, hold me back!


228
00:11:18.894 --> 00:11:20.262
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:23.899
Turn in your supersuits
and be out by noon tomorrow.


230
00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:27.036
But where are we supposed to go?

231
00:11:30.473 --> 00:11:32.742
We're back in Hiddenville, baby.

232
00:11:35.277 --> 00:11:38.381
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>
<i>Welcome home, Thundermans.</i>


233
00:11:38.481 --> 00:11:40.650
<i>Would it have killed you</i>
<i>to say goodbye?</i>


234
00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:44.487
I can't believe we're back.

235
00:11:44.587 --> 00:11:46.689
I know,
it looks exactly the same.


236
00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:48.391
Right? It's like we never left.

237
00:11:48.491 --> 00:11:50.893
- It's more like we left...
- Kicked butt for three years.


238
00:11:50.993 --> 00:11:52.495
...had a mission ruined
by superjerks.


239
00:11:52.595 --> 00:11:55.197
- Got fired.
- Came back to wallow in shame.


240
00:11:55.765 --> 00:11:58.033
Okay, you two,
maybe it isn't ideal,


241
00:11:58.133 --> 00:11:59.735
but at least
we're still a family.


242
00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:01.871
Just try and make
the best of it.


243
00:12:03.072 --> 00:12:04.239
Stop mocking me.

244
00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.444
Come on. Let's go shopping
for high school clothes.


245
00:12:08.544 --> 00:12:09.845
We're going to high school?

246
00:12:09.945 --> 00:12:12.281
Yeah, we finally get to be
around other teenagers.


247
00:12:12.382 --> 00:12:14.049
And get a well-rounded
education?


248
00:12:14.149 --> 00:12:15.084
Who cares?

249
00:12:16.586 --> 00:12:20.055
Oh... I missed you,
old friend.


250
00:12:20.155 --> 00:12:23.459
Hank, do you and your butt
groove want to be alone?


251
00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:25.327
For a few minutes, Barb. Thanks.

252
00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:29.031
I'm kidding, of course.

253
00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:31.834
I'll see you later.

254
00:12:34.169 --> 00:12:36.606
- What do we do now, Max?
- Never use the couch again?


255
00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:40.042
No, I mean <i>this.</i>
It's all so weird.


256
00:12:40.142 --> 00:12:42.344
If we're not superheroes
anymore, who are we?


257
00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:43.979
We <i>are</i> superheroes, Phoebe.

258
00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:46.048
Remember,
we still have our powers.


259
00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:51.286
That's really old.

260
00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:54.223
I still don't get it.

261
00:12:54.323 --> 00:12:57.192
We never summoned the V-Team.
Why'd they even show up?


262
00:12:59.995 --> 00:13:01.931
Phoebes, don't worry
about the V-Team.


263
00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.365
They're already regretting
taking our jobs.


264
00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:05.735
Because they know they can't
live up to our legacy?


265
00:13:05.835 --> 00:13:08.404
No, because I put glue
on all the toilet seats.


266
00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:13.909
One good thing
about getting fired?


267
00:13:14.577 --> 00:13:16.178
I have my own private
lair again.


268
00:13:18.414 --> 00:13:20.049
So the dog says,

269
00:13:20.149 --> 00:13:23.152
"Flea shampoo? I didn't even
know they had hair."


270
00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:36.098
Human! Run for it!

271
00:13:38.934 --> 00:13:41.637
Hey, come back.
The party's just started.


272
00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:42.738
There's no humans here.

273
00:13:42.838 --> 00:13:43.939
Hey, Colosso.

274
00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:45.741
Aah! Max!

275
00:13:46.776 --> 00:13:48.177
What are you doing back?

276
00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:50.212
We got replaced.

277
00:13:50.312 --> 00:13:51.581
What?

278
00:13:51.681 --> 00:13:53.849
Who could possibly replace
Max Thunderman


279
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:55.485
and his annoying family?

280
00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.587
These three supes called
the V-Team.


281
00:13:58.087 --> 00:13:59.989
Hey, Max, I was thinking--

282
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:00.756
Colosso?

283
00:14:00.856 --> 00:14:03.626
Hey! It's Phoebe!

284
00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:05.961
Listen, I heard what happened,

285
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:07.763
and I want you to know, well,

286
00:14:07.863 --> 00:14:08.964
I'm here for you.

287
00:14:09.064 --> 00:14:10.232
Eww.

288
00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:12.935
Yup, felt gross to me too.

289
00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:16.706
Anyway, I was thinking
about what Mom said,


290
00:14:16.806 --> 00:14:18.040
about making the best of it,

291
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.909
and, I mean, superheroes
help people, right?


292
00:14:20.009 --> 00:14:22.277
So I'm gonna figure out
how I can help people


293
00:14:22.377 --> 00:14:23.278
here in Hiddenville.

294
00:14:23.378 --> 00:14:25.347
Loser talk!

295
00:14:25.447 --> 00:14:26.549
Excuse me?

296
00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:28.651
You guys have superpowers.

297
00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:32.254
You should use them
to incite fear and terror!


298
00:14:32.354 --> 00:14:33.823
Hmm. You mean, like this?

299
00:14:36.659 --> 00:14:38.293
See, she gets it.

300
00:14:39.762 --> 00:14:41.597
You're right, Colosso,

301
00:14:41.697 --> 00:14:43.265
I am gonna use my superpowers.

302
00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:45.535
To incite fear and terror?

303
00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:46.936
To get a job.

304
00:14:47.036 --> 00:14:49.271
Need to make some money
to rebuild the Max brand.


305
00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:52.908
What do you guys have
against fear and terror?


306
00:14:56.445 --> 00:14:58.480
Making waffles on a school day.

307
00:14:58.581 --> 00:14:59.949
Really takes me back.

308
00:15:00.049 --> 00:15:01.884
We may not be superheroes
anymore,


309
00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:03.853
but we're still super parents.

310
00:15:03.953 --> 00:15:05.120
Morning! No time to sit.

311
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.922
These look great. Thanks!
Got to go! Bye!


312
00:15:07.022 --> 00:15:09.659
Whoa, slow down.
What is the big rush?


313
00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:10.960
We have friends to make.

314
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.695
Do you have everything you need
for school?


315
00:15:12.795 --> 00:15:14.797
Cool teen clothes to fit in
with our peers.


316
00:15:14.897 --> 00:15:17.332
Some surefire
conversation starters.


317
00:15:17.432 --> 00:15:19.602
"That new band is fire."

318
00:15:19.702 --> 00:15:21.070
"Parents, am I right?"

319
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.940
And a hundred sticks
of beef jerky.


320
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.176
Nothing says friendship
like cured meat.


321
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.646
Any pens, notebooks?
Maybe a ruler?


322
00:15:30.746 --> 00:15:32.748
- Dad, it's not about that.
- Nora!


323
00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:34.750
You want a bow for school?

324
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.151
No, thanks!

325
00:15:39.722 --> 00:15:41.824
It's like they don't need us
anymore.


326
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:45.327
Thank goodness our baby
still needs us.


327
00:15:45.427 --> 00:15:46.796
Yeah.

328
00:15:48.631 --> 00:15:50.933
There's our little fifth-grader.

329
00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.836
Oh, she's got her backpack
and her--


330
00:15:53.936 --> 00:15:56.071
- skateboard?
- Skateboard?


331
00:15:56.972 --> 00:15:58.107
Max gave it to me.

332
00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:00.009
Now that we're not
superheroes anymore,


333
00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:02.578
I can do all sorts of fun stuff
without you guys protecting me.


334
00:16:05.147 --> 00:16:06.348
Did you hear that, Hank?

335
00:16:06.448 --> 00:16:09.251
Chloe doesn't want us
to protect her.


336
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:11.353
She doesn't need us
anymore either.


337
00:16:13.789 --> 00:16:15.557
I'm frightened, Hank.

338
00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:17.693
It's okay, Barb,

339
00:16:17.793 --> 00:16:19.895
maybe it's time for Mommy
and Daddy bird


340
00:16:19.995 --> 00:16:23.132
to step aside
and let our baby birds


341
00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:24.466
fly.

342
00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:28.370
She's using the toaster
unsupervised.


343
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.905
Oh, not on our watch!

344
00:16:36.846 --> 00:16:38.981
Parents, am I right?

345
00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:42.284
Oh, hey, look. It's that
Principal Bradford guy.


346
00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:47.222
Well!

347
00:16:47.322 --> 00:16:49.892
You must be our two new
students, huh?


348
00:16:49.992 --> 00:16:52.928
Let's see here.
We got Billy and Nora


349
00:16:53.028 --> 00:16:55.698
Thunderma--

350
00:16:55.798 --> 00:16:57.900
No!

351
00:16:58.768 --> 00:16:59.935
Are you kidding me?

352
00:17:00.035 --> 00:17:02.304
Are you two the siblings of...

353
00:17:02.404 --> 00:17:03.138
those other ones?

354
00:17:03.238 --> 00:17:05.074
Oh, you mean Max and Phoeb--

355
00:17:05.174 --> 00:17:07.276
Don't say their names.

356
00:17:08.377 --> 00:17:10.612
Those two delinquents
ruined my life.


357
00:17:10.713 --> 00:17:12.414
You seem fine now.

358
00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:16.018
When they left town,

359
00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.787
it was like a cloud was lifted.

360
00:17:17.887 --> 00:17:19.722
I stopped sleeping
at the school,


361
00:17:19.822 --> 00:17:21.190
got back together with Janet,

362
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.358
and I grew this awesome
ponytail.


363
00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:25.861
Hey, boss.
P-tail's looking tight!


364
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:29.131
Thanks, dawg,
just had it blown out.


365
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:31.433
So what'll it take
to keep you two away, huh?


366
00:17:31.533 --> 00:17:33.936
Money, candy, fake I.D.s?

367
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.538
We could just
stay out of your way.


368
00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:38.073
Oh.

369
00:17:38.173 --> 00:17:39.809
Playing the long game, huh?

370
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:43.112
Arrgh! That's just what
they would do!


371
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.581
Move. Now. Move!

372
00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:48.517
Time to make friends.

373
00:17:48.617 --> 00:17:50.119
Remember, don't use our powers.

374
00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:52.688
We want people to like us
for us.


375
00:17:52.788 --> 00:17:53.989
Right.

376
00:17:54.089 --> 00:17:55.457
We heard your last name's
Thunderman.


377
00:17:55.557 --> 00:17:57.960
- Do you have superpowers?
- I sure do. Check it out!


378
00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.661
No way!

379
00:17:59.762 --> 00:18:01.296
Did you see that?

380
00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:05.367
Nora, I thought you said
don't use our powers.


381
00:18:05.467 --> 00:18:08.237
I know, I panicked.
I really want friends.


382
00:18:09.872 --> 00:18:11.440
Hey, check it out.

383
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:17.046
- Cherry!
- Phoebe!


384
00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:22.051
Reunion selfie.

385
00:18:23.886 --> 00:18:25.254
I missed you so much.

386
00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:26.255
Me too.

387
00:18:26.355 --> 00:18:27.256
I've been auditioning
new Phoebes,


388
00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:28.490
but no one's
working out.


389
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.925
Good one.

390
00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:32.361
Harriet, I told you no.

391
00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:39.134
I'm so sorry
you lost your job.


392
00:18:39.234 --> 00:18:41.303
Oh, it's okay. I'm fine.

393
00:18:41.403 --> 00:18:42.738
Fresh start.

394
00:18:42.838 --> 00:18:43.906
I wanna get a job.

395
00:18:44.006 --> 00:18:45.307
One where I can still
help people.


396
00:18:45.407 --> 00:18:48.243
I have a job where I help
people all day.


397
00:18:50.813 --> 00:18:52.647
- You work at Splatburger?
- Uh-huh.


398
00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:54.683
Can we get our check?

399
00:18:54.784 --> 00:18:55.785
It's on the house.

400
00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:57.319
Oh.

401
00:18:57.853 --> 00:18:59.789
I don't even know
what that means!


402
00:19:00.655 --> 00:19:02.624
It means you got
a lot of happy customers.


403
00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:04.794
O.M.G., I have the best idea.

404
00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.295
You should work here with me!

405
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:09.064
Ooh, you want me to work
for Mrs. Wong?


406
00:19:09.164 --> 00:19:11.633
It's okay, she's completely
different now.


407
00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:14.003
Phoebe Thunderman?

408
00:19:14.103 --> 00:19:15.737
Hi, Mrs. Wong.

409
00:19:15.838 --> 00:19:18.440
Oh! This brings back so many

410
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.075
bad memories.

411
00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:22.644
I thought you said
she was different now.


412
00:19:22.744 --> 00:19:24.179
I meant she lost the accent.

413
00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:26.281
She's still really mean.

414
00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:28.450
Mrs. Wong,

415
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.620
what do you think of the idea
of Phoebe working here?


416
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:33.555
I'd love that!

417
00:19:33.655 --> 00:19:34.890
- You would?
- Yes.


418
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.993
I'd have a famous celebrity
working in my restaurant.


419
00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:41.130
And you'd be humiliated.

420
00:19:42.664 --> 00:19:44.333
Yay!

421
00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:46.268
Come back to the kitchen
and I'll show you what to do


422
00:19:46.368 --> 00:19:48.370
when the raccoons
get into the tater tots.


423
00:19:52.141 --> 00:19:54.476
It's so sweetcheous you're back,
Max.


424
00:19:54.576 --> 00:19:57.479
Thanks, guys.
Stoked to rejoin the band.


425
00:19:57.579 --> 00:20:00.015
And sorry you had to fire
your old lead singer.


426
00:20:00.115 --> 00:20:01.316
Ah, don't sweat it.

427
00:20:01.416 --> 00:20:03.018
Grandpa Giddy understands.

428
00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:05.821
Curse you, Max Thunderman!

429
00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:12.862
Ah, I miss this terrible food.

430
00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:14.163
Careful, Max,

431
00:20:14.263 --> 00:20:15.831
Wong installed microphones
at every table


432
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:17.299
to shut down complainers.

433
00:20:17.399 --> 00:20:19.034
<i>Oh, you don't like the fries?</i>

434
00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:21.270
<i>Then say bye to your fries!</i>

435
00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:25.841
So, Wolfgang,
what are you up to?


436
00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:27.042
Wolfgang.

437
00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:28.410
That's what I thought.

438
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.645
Is that your mom?

439
00:20:30.745 --> 00:20:32.481
Tell her I'm still single.

440
00:20:33.048 --> 00:20:34.349
Still not cool, Gideon.

441
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.986
Probably a customer
for my new business,


442
00:20:37.086 --> 00:20:38.787
"Superpowers By The Hour."

443
00:20:38.888 --> 00:20:40.455
I put up flyers all over town.

444
00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:42.291
Yeah, this is Max.

445
00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:44.293
I'm available. 
How's 2:00 p.m.?

446
00:20:45.527 --> 00:20:47.662
Take that!

447
00:20:56.671 --> 00:20:57.873
Oh!

448
00:20:58.573 --> 00:20:59.741
Ugh!

449
00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:01.610
I'm such a butter-claws.

450
00:21:03.612 --> 00:21:05.147
I've got visitors
for Dark Mayhem,


451
00:21:05.247 --> 00:21:07.649
King Crab, and the other guy.

452
00:21:07.749 --> 00:21:09.718
Strongdor have name too!

453
00:21:09.818 --> 00:21:11.853
Hey, Leon, think fast!

454
00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:18.693
Thank you, guard,
we'll take it from here.


455
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.331
Listen up, villains,

456
00:21:22.431 --> 00:21:25.000
we're in charge now,
so show a little respect.


457
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.336
What happened
to the Thundermans?


458
00:21:27.436 --> 00:21:29.738
Those second-rate cape jockeys?

459
00:21:29.838 --> 00:21:32.541
We kicked 'em to the curb
and sent them on their way...


460
00:21:33.142 --> 00:21:34.609
Dad.

461
00:21:34.709 --> 00:21:37.379
I told you our kids
wouldn't let us down.


462
00:21:37.479 --> 00:21:41.316
Now please, take off
those hideous disguises.


463
00:21:47.957 --> 00:21:50.559
Hey! Him Strongdor son!

464
00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:53.862
Oh, I just can't get over it.

465
00:21:53.963 --> 00:21:56.498
You all look so tall and evil.

466
00:21:57.366 --> 00:21:59.134
Stand up straight, pumpkin.

467
00:21:59.234 --> 00:22:00.702
O.M.G., Dad. Cringe.

468
00:22:00.802 --> 00:22:03.805
I'm not a kid,
I'm a full-on princess.


469
00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:06.141
Looks like Dark Mayhem, Jr.,

470
00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:08.343
forgot his cape and mask.

471
00:22:08.443 --> 00:22:10.312
I don't do capes, Dad.

472
00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:12.647
And this ocular blaster's lit.

473
00:22:12.747 --> 00:22:14.583
But I wear a mask.

474
00:22:14.683 --> 00:22:16.818
Yeah, and no one knows what
you're saying half the time.


475
00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:19.554
You're like,.

476
00:22:19.654 --> 00:22:20.555
What?

477
00:22:20.655 --> 00:22:22.958
Guys, guys,
this is a prison cell.


478
00:22:23.058 --> 00:22:24.359
Let's keep it civil.

479
00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:26.895
Now where are the Thundermans?

480
00:22:26.996 --> 00:22:28.063
Back in Hiddenville.

481
00:22:28.163 --> 00:22:30.966
They were positively
gobsmacked.


482
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.269
Wife send boy
to fancy boarding school.


483
00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:36.238
Now him talk weird.

484
00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:38.207
Excellent.

485
00:22:38.307 --> 00:22:40.209
With the Thundermans
out of the picture,


486
00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:42.311
you can release us
and we can finally


487
00:22:42.411 --> 00:22:44.613
resume our evil plans.

488
00:22:44.713 --> 00:22:47.916
- Yeah, about that--
- Show 'em what we've got, boys!


489
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.922
One, tap into everyone's
landlines


490
00:22:54.023 --> 00:22:57.059
and transmit the hypnotic
message for them to obey us.


491
00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:58.493
What's a landline?

492
00:22:59.061 --> 00:23:03.298
Two, invite every superhero
to an outdoor Macarena contest--


493
00:23:03.398 --> 00:23:05.400
Yeah, we get it. You're old.

494
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:08.337
Look, here's the thing,

495
00:23:08.437 --> 00:23:10.905
we've decided
to do our own plan.


496
00:23:12.274 --> 00:23:15.344
We're totes gonna create a
worldwide army of supervillains.


497
00:23:15.444 --> 00:23:17.746
With a secret item
the Hero League


498
00:23:17.846 --> 00:23:20.315
has been guarding
for over 100 years.


499
00:23:20.415 --> 00:23:22.451
Oh, do you hear that, Strongdor?

500
00:23:22.551 --> 00:23:24.219
There's a secret item.

501
00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:25.820
It's cool, guys.

502
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.724
We'll just do our plans
when their dumb one fails.


503
00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:31.193
Whoa!

504
00:23:31.293 --> 00:23:33.528
Listen up, boomer.

505
00:23:33.628 --> 00:23:35.864
You had your chance
and you blew it.


506
00:23:35.964 --> 00:23:38.267
Now it's time for me
to make a name for myself!


507
00:23:38.367 --> 00:23:41.970
Your name's literally
Dark Mayhem, Jr.!


508
00:23:44.506 --> 00:23:46.408
Come on, we're out of here.

509
00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:47.942
- Nepo baby.
- What?


510
00:23:48.043 --> 00:23:49.411
N
-Nothing.

511
00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:51.180
Wait, aren't you going
to let us out?


512
00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.216
O.M.G, Dad,
it's not always about you.


513
00:23:54.316 --> 00:23:56.185
- Let's bounce.
- Cheerio!


514
00:24:03.758 --> 00:24:05.294
Thanks for the ride home,
Cherry.


515
00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:07.562
Any time. Being seen
on the Splat Scooter


516
00:24:07.662 --> 00:24:09.731
really ups my cool factor.

517
00:24:14.869 --> 00:24:16.938
So, how was work?

518
00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:18.840
Fantastic. How about yours?

519
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.242
Awesome.

520
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:23.578
We have to get
our jobs back! I know!


521
00:24:23.678 --> 00:24:25.580
Mrs. Wong made me use
my freeze breath


522
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.382
to make burger grease slushies.

523
00:24:27.482 --> 00:24:29.251
Mr. Fustarellio made me use
my heat breath


524
00:24:29.351 --> 00:24:30.619
to make homemade candles.

525
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:32.954
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- From his ear wax.


526
00:24:34.123 --> 00:24:36.558
We have to convince President
Kickbutt to hire us back.


527
00:24:36.658 --> 00:24:39.094
How?
She fired the entire T-Force.


528
00:24:39.194 --> 00:24:40.695
True.

529
00:24:41.463 --> 00:24:43.432
But she didn't fire...

530
00:24:43.532 --> 00:24:45.534
the Tree Force!

531
00:24:46.468 --> 00:24:49.671
You want us to fight crime
dressed as apple trees?


532
00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:52.674
Yes! We'll have cool,
apple-based weapons


533
00:24:52.774 --> 00:24:54.976
and nicknames.
Dad, you're "Red Delicious."


534
00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:57.146
- Mom, you're "Pink Lady."
- Can I be "Granny Smith"?


535
00:24:57.246 --> 00:24:59.448
You just made the Tree Force!

536
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.984
You guys seem
a little desperate.


537
00:25:03.084 --> 00:25:04.853
- Uh-huh.
- You think?


538
00:25:05.854 --> 00:25:07.522
We just can't give up
this easily.


539
00:25:07.622 --> 00:25:09.824
Can't you talk with President
Kickbutt and reason with her?


540
00:25:09.924 --> 00:25:12.093
Yeah, how do you guys stand
not being superheroes?


541
00:25:12.194 --> 00:25:15.830
Actually, you guys may not want
to hear this, but...


542
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:18.933
we don't wanna be
the T-Force anymore.


543
00:25:19.033 --> 00:25:21.803
Because you want to be
the Tree Force, right?


544
00:25:23.238 --> 00:25:24.606
Right?

545
00:25:24.706 --> 00:25:28.510
No, because you guys were
kind of tough to work for.


546
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.812
Between Phoebe's obsession
with being the best


547
00:25:30.912 --> 00:25:33.182
and Max's with being
the best-looking,


548
00:25:33.282 --> 00:25:35.617
you forgot that we are a family.

549
00:25:35.717 --> 00:25:37.952
What are you talking about?
We spent 24/7 together.


550
00:25:38.052 --> 00:25:41.490
We spent 24/7 with Thunder Girl
and Swoosh Boy,


551
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.225
but you had us work all the time

552
00:25:43.325 --> 00:25:45.227
so you could get
more superhero glory.


553
00:25:45.327 --> 00:25:48.563
This is crazy. You guys miss
being superheroes, don't you?


554
00:25:49.598 --> 00:25:50.999
It feels nice to finally
make friends.


555
00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:53.435
I got invited to the skate park
tomorrow.


556
00:25:53.535 --> 00:25:54.603
- What?
- What?


557
00:25:54.703 --> 00:25:56.905
First the avocado toast,
now this.


558
00:25:57.005 --> 00:25:59.508
All right, well, maybe you're
all done being superheroes,


559
00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:00.709
but we're not.

560
00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:02.877
Some of us have
some self-respect.


561
00:26:02.977 --> 00:26:03.978
Come on, Max.

562
00:26:14.889 --> 00:26:17.759
How can they say
we don't care about family?


563
00:26:17.859 --> 00:26:19.828
We're the ones who hired them
to be on the T-Force.


564
00:26:19.928 --> 00:26:22.631
I know. And your need to be the
best helped make us successful.


565
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:24.399
- Thank you!
- Even if it was annoying.


566
00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:26.835
Thank you. Wait, what?

567
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:29.271
Well, like they said...

568
00:26:29.371 --> 00:26:31.573
you could be a little demanding.

569
00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:33.508
How am I demanding?

570
00:26:34.075 --> 00:26:36.211
I demand you tell me
how I was demanding!


571
00:26:36.311 --> 00:26:37.812
Hey, they said it.

572
00:26:37.912 --> 00:26:39.848
I'm just agreeing
a thousand percent.


573
00:26:39.948 --> 00:26:42.016
A least I cared
about my job.


574
00:26:42.116 --> 00:26:43.785
All you cared about
were your followers


575
00:26:43.885 --> 00:26:45.620
and how your swoosh looked
on the cover of <i>Supe Magazine.</i>


576
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.722
She can hear you!

577
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:50.492
Don't listen to the mean lady.

578
00:26:50.925 --> 00:26:52.160
You know what?

579
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:53.362
Maybe the T
-Force <i>is</i> over.

580
00:26:53.462 --> 00:26:55.264
I'm gonna get my job back
by myself.


581
00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:57.466
From now on,
call me the "Pheeb Force."


582
00:26:57.566 --> 00:27:01.035
Fine. Then I'm getting
my job back by myself.


583
00:27:01.135 --> 00:27:02.704
Dweeb Force.

584
00:27:05.407 --> 00:27:07.075
How did I not see that coming?

585
00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:10.078
<i>- * Superheroes, rockin' band *</i>

586
00:27:10.178 --> 00:27:12.447
<i>* They're the coolest superhero</i>
<i>team in all the la-- *</i>


587
00:27:14.182 --> 00:27:15.650
What are you doing?

588
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.720
Uh, not rocking out
to the V-Team's terrible song?


589
00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.022
Those light-up-pajama-wearing
posers?


590
00:27:21.122 --> 00:27:22.190
Whatever.

591
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:23.858
You know, Max,

592
00:27:23.958 --> 00:27:26.695
these V-Teamers look familiar,
like I've met them before.


593
00:27:26.795 --> 00:27:28.797
And how would <i>you</i>
have met <i>them?</i>


594
00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:30.799
They're superheroes,
you're a supervillain.


595
00:27:30.899 --> 00:27:34.769
Unless...
they're <i>not</i> superheroes.


596
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:36.638
Give me that.

597
00:27:36.738 --> 00:27:38.106
What-
- What are you doing?

598
00:27:38.206 --> 00:27:40.008
Running their images through
a facial recognition app


599
00:27:40.108 --> 00:27:42.110
to see if there's any pics
from their past.


600
00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:45.113
I got a hit!

601
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.783
Looks like a picture of them
at summer camp eight years ago.


602
00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:51.152
The girl has a crab claw.

603
00:27:51.252 --> 00:27:53.788
Max! That's how I know them!

604
00:27:53.888 --> 00:27:56.157
I was their counselor
at Camp Evil Weevil!


605
00:27:56.257 --> 00:27:57.626
- What?
- They're the kids


606
00:27:57.726 --> 00:28:00.161
of Dark Mayhem, King Crab,
and Strongdor.


607
00:28:00.595 --> 00:28:02.163
So the V
-Team are villains?

608
00:28:02.263 --> 00:28:04.466
Posing as heroes
to do their evil


609
00:28:04.566 --> 00:28:06.335
from inside
the Hero League.


610
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:07.869
And if I expose them,

611
00:28:07.969 --> 00:28:10.238
then President Kickbutt
will fire them and take me back!


612
00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:11.506
Where's my old supersuit?

613
00:28:11.606 --> 00:28:14.309
Your supersuit? Uh...

614
00:28:14.409 --> 00:28:16.277
Is that it in your cage?

615
00:28:17.779 --> 00:28:20.382
I just used it
as a soothing blankie.


616
00:28:20.482 --> 00:28:22.250
But you might want to pop it
in the wash.


617
00:28:23.051 --> 00:28:23.985
Yuck!

618
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.756
I better hurry up
and expose them


619
00:28:27.856 --> 00:28:29.090
before Phoebe
figures it out.


620
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.359
Yeah, right!

621
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:33.428
Like she's smart enough
to figure it out on her own.


622
00:28:34.563 --> 00:28:36.197
Camp Evil Weevil?

623
00:28:36.297 --> 00:28:37.966
The V
-Team are villains!

624
00:28:38.066 --> 00:28:41.002
The "V" stands for "Villain."

625
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:43.872
Better act fast
before Max finds out.


626
00:28:44.573 --> 00:28:47.241
Time for Thunder Girl
to get back her J.O.B.


627
00:28:48.309 --> 00:28:50.412
Dweeb Force, away!

628
00:28:50.512 --> 00:28:52.581
Dangit! Now I'm saying it.

629
00:28:57.986 --> 00:28:59.654
Can you heat up my pizza, Nora?

630
00:28:59.754 --> 00:29:01.255
Sure, Jonah.

631
00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:04.493
Can you laser a "Z"
on my locker?


632
00:29:04.593 --> 00:29:06.227
No problem, Zoe.

633
00:29:08.763 --> 00:29:10.699
That's so cool.

634
00:29:11.466 --> 00:29:13.167
Hey, I'm Billy.

635
00:29:13.267 --> 00:29:14.969
You want some beef jerky?

636
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.177
I guess we're going with powers.

637
00:29:24.413 --> 00:29:25.880
I'm Billy Thunderman,

638
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.616
the fastest dude on Earth.

639
00:29:28.417 --> 00:29:31.486
Billy, what are you doing?

640
00:29:31.586 --> 00:29:33.555
Who wants to see my powers
in action?


641
00:29:33.655 --> 00:29:36.157
Can you get me an Italian ice
from Italy?


642
00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:45.967
Can you super-speed to the top
of Mt. Metroburg?


643
00:29:47.301 --> 00:29:49.370
No way! Look!

644
00:29:49.471 --> 00:29:51.305
So, what else do you guys want?

645
00:29:53.007 --> 00:29:54.876
Billy, you're stealing
all my friends.


646
00:29:54.976 --> 00:29:56.344
I'm just doing
what you're doing.


647
00:29:56.445 --> 00:29:58.480
Well now, I'm doing this.

648
00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.481
Ow!

649
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.891
What in Aunt Sally's Clam Shack
is going on here?


650
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:17.999
No!

651
00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.738
- Oopsie.
- Oopsie.


652
00:30:24.606 --> 00:30:26.207
Don't look at me.

653
00:30:26.307 --> 00:30:27.676
I'm hideous!

654
00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:39.621
Oh, we've been looking
for hours.


655
00:30:39.721 --> 00:30:41.422
The secret item isn't here.

656
00:30:41.523 --> 00:30:42.824
It has to be here!

657
00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:44.959
The ancient Hero League book
says it's guarded


658
00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:46.695
by the League's
longest-serving hero,


659
00:30:46.795 --> 00:30:47.862
and that's Thunderman.

660
00:30:47.962 --> 00:30:50.465
Ermahgerd, can you guys mute it?

661
00:30:50.565 --> 00:30:51.966
I'm trying to concentrate.

662
00:30:53.067 --> 00:30:54.268
You could help, you know.

663
00:30:54.368 --> 00:30:57.639
Mm, ransacking's a lot,
and I'm a princess.


664
00:30:57.739 --> 00:31:00.709
Of what?
Freak Claw Island?


665
00:31:00.809 --> 00:31:03.077
Of kicking your
fake British butt!


666
00:31:03.177 --> 00:31:04.813
Guys! Guys!

667
00:31:04.913 --> 00:31:07.315
Let's settle this like we
used to at Camp Evil Weevil.


668
00:31:07.415 --> 00:31:08.983
Not rock, paper, lasers!

669
00:31:09.083 --> 00:31:10.919
Too late! Rock, paper, lasers...

670
00:31:11.019 --> 00:31:12.453
Ow!

671
00:31:12.554 --> 00:31:14.388
Now keep looking!

672
00:31:37.445 --> 00:31:38.547
Oh!

673
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.982
- Shh!
- Max, what are you doing here?


674
00:31:41.082 --> 00:31:42.584
Stopping the V-Team
without you, so beat it.


675
00:31:42.684 --> 00:31:44.118
- No way, you beat it!
- No, you beat it!


676
00:31:44.218 --> 00:31:46.855
Someone's coming, let's go.

677
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:52.961
Ah-ha! I found something.

678
00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:55.697
Keys to the Hero League
mega yacht.


679
00:31:55.797 --> 00:31:58.099
- We had a mega yacht?
- Shh!


680
00:31:59.868 --> 00:32:02.236
Key card to the designer
utility belt closet.


681
00:32:02.336 --> 00:32:04.305
We had a designer
utility belt closet?


682
00:32:04.405 --> 00:32:05.774
Shh!

683
00:32:19.754 --> 00:32:20.989
Hello!

684
00:32:24.425 --> 00:32:26.695
- Is that Blobbin?
- Yup, right on time.


685
00:32:26.795 --> 00:32:28.730
Great!
With that helicopter,


686
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:32.133
we can spy on Chloe while she
skateboards with her friends.


687
00:32:32.233 --> 00:32:35.036
You mean, lovingly watch her
and be the protective parents


688
00:32:35.136 --> 00:32:36.971
that she still so clearly needs.

689
00:32:37.071 --> 00:32:38.673
Yeah, what you said.

690
00:32:38.773 --> 00:32:40.474
Thunderfam!

691
00:32:40.575 --> 00:32:43.277
Bring it in, you two.

692
00:32:43.377 --> 00:32:46.047
- Oh!
- Thanks for coming, Blobbin!


693
00:32:46.147 --> 00:32:49.550
Oh, of course! When my family
says they need a helicopter,


694
00:32:49.651 --> 00:32:51.285
they get a helicopter.

695
00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:52.553
Oh!

696
00:32:52.654 --> 00:32:55.289
The T-11 Blob-copter
is perfect


697
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:58.827
for saving that stranded
bald eagle family.


698
00:32:58.927 --> 00:33:00.428
- Saving the--
- Yeah...


699
00:33:00.528 --> 00:33:03.231
that's what we're using it for,
Barb, remember?


700
00:33:03.732 --> 00:33:05.634
We'll return it good as new.

701
00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:08.236
Oh, no! It's a gift.

702
00:33:08.336 --> 00:33:11.472
I have eighteen more.
I'm very rich.


703
00:33:11.572 --> 00:33:13.107
Yes, I recall.

704
00:33:13.207 --> 00:33:16.144
Oh! There's my ride back.

705
00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:19.513
It's our latest model,
completely pilotless.


706
00:33:19.614 --> 00:33:21.449
Pilotless? Isn't that dangerous?

707
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:22.851
Oh, no, Barb.

708
00:33:22.951 --> 00:33:24.653
Safety comes first at BlobCo.

709
00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:26.855
See, first we drop the ladder...

710
00:33:27.521 --> 00:33:28.690
- Oh!
- And then,


711
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.659
I have fifteen seconds
to climb on board


712
00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:32.493
before it flies away.

713
00:33:32.593 --> 00:33:36.430
Oh, give the family a great
big hug from Cousin Blobbin.


714
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.933
Will do! Thanks, Blobbin!

715
00:33:39.467 --> 00:33:42.771
- Bald eagles, Hank?
- Want me to tell him the truth?


716
00:33:42.871 --> 00:33:44.639
That we're spying
on our own daughter?


717
00:33:45.606 --> 00:33:46.841
My foot's stuck!

718
00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:49.210
You're probably right.
He wouldn't understand.


719
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.946
Let's go check out our chopper!

720
00:33:52.046 --> 00:33:53.815
Hank? Barb?

721
00:33:53.915 --> 00:33:55.216
Hank?

722
00:33:55.316 --> 00:33:56.317
Guys?

723
00:33:56.785 --> 00:33:57.752
Help!

724
00:34:01.455 --> 00:34:03.524
So far, so good, Barb!

725
00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:05.159
Chloe's got her helmet on

726
00:34:05.259 --> 00:34:08.062
and has no idea
we're watching her.


727
00:34:08.162 --> 00:34:10.131
You know,
we really should consider


728
00:34:10.231 --> 00:34:12.366
writing a book on parenting.

729
00:34:12.934 --> 00:34:13.935
Too busy!

730
00:34:14.035 --> 00:34:16.771
Chloe needs us 24 hours a day.

731
00:34:16.871 --> 00:34:18.673
Yeah, of course.
What was I thinking?


732
00:34:20.842 --> 00:34:23.344
Hey, Cherry.
Yup, send 'em on up.


733
00:34:23.444 --> 00:34:24.545
What was that about?

734
00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:26.147
Oh, I ordered some Splat Shakes.

735
00:34:26.247 --> 00:34:29.217
Cherry's delivering them
with Mrs. Wong's splat-a-pult.


736
00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:30.451
Hank.

737
00:34:30.551 --> 00:34:33.421
Two strawberry Splat Shakes,
traveling!


738
00:34:35.289 --> 00:34:36.424
Oh! Ah!

739
00:34:36.524 --> 00:34:38.827
Hank! What did you do?!

740
00:34:38.927 --> 00:34:41.162
They came at me so fast, Barb!

741
00:34:41.262 --> 00:34:43.898
Hank, you short-circuited
the steering.


742
00:34:43.998 --> 00:34:46.667
We're gonna have to make
an emergency landing.


743
00:35:03.617 --> 00:35:04.652
Mom and Dad?

744
00:35:04.753 --> 00:35:07.555
Chloe! Wh... What a surprise!

745
00:35:07.655 --> 00:35:09.758
Look, Barb.

746
00:35:09.858 --> 00:35:11.025
- It's Chloe!
- Oh!


747
00:35:11.125 --> 00:35:13.161
Hey, Chloe!

748
00:35:14.729 --> 00:35:16.397
- Are you guys okay?
- Oh, yeah!


749
00:35:16.497 --> 00:35:19.433
We're taking the Thunder Copter
out for a little spin.


750
00:35:19.533 --> 00:35:22.270
- R-Right, Barb?
- Yeah, hey, we're all good.


751
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.439
Just resume your unmonitored
skateboarding.


752
00:35:26.274 --> 00:35:27.776
Were you guys spying on me?

753
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:29.243
Wh-
- Wh--

754
00:35:29.343 --> 00:35:30.511
What?

755
00:35:31.245 --> 00:35:33.447
No, we are not spying.

756
00:35:33.547 --> 00:35:35.249
This is so embarrassing.

757
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:37.886
Can't I even go skateboarding
with my friends by myself?


758
00:35:37.986 --> 00:35:39.453
You're such helicopter parents.

759
00:35:39.553 --> 00:35:40.755
We are not.

760
00:35:40.855 --> 00:35:43.157
You're holding a piece
of helicopter.


761
00:35:44.025 --> 00:35:45.794
Oh, uh...

762
00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:48.029
well, that is easy to explain.

763
00:35:48.129 --> 00:35:50.832
Um, you see... Um...

764
00:35:50.932 --> 00:35:52.366
Your mom did it!

765
00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:05.213
Well, this is a nice surprise.

766
00:36:05.313 --> 00:36:06.981
So, I guess you know our secret.

767
00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:09.450
That you're weird and lame?
Not a secret.


768
00:36:10.318 --> 00:36:12.053
No, that we're the children of--

769
00:36:12.153 --> 00:36:13.988
Dr. Mayhem, King Crab,
and Strongdor?


770
00:36:14.088 --> 00:36:15.756
Also not a secret.

771
00:36:15.857 --> 00:36:18.226
Dang it! Stop knowing things!

772
00:36:18.659 --> 00:36:21.562
We also know you framed us
and stole our jobs.


773
00:36:21.662 --> 00:36:22.997
Tell us why.

774
00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:24.598
To get our hands on something
the Hero League


775
00:36:24.698 --> 00:36:27.035
has been guarding
for over a hundred years.


776
00:36:27.135 --> 00:36:28.302
The Power Plant!

777
00:36:28.402 --> 00:36:30.704
- The what now?
- The power who?


778
00:36:30.805 --> 00:36:32.673
Don't pretend you don't know
about the Power Plant.


779
00:36:32.773 --> 00:36:34.508
I'm still mad no one told us
about the mega yacht.


780
00:36:34.608 --> 00:36:37.178
And the designer super-belt
collection.


781
00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:39.180
Oh, girl, it's so dope.
I'd show it to you,


782
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.150
but we're probably gonna torture
you or blast you into space


783
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.617
- so what's the point?
- Enough!


784
00:36:43.717 --> 00:36:44.953
Tell them about the plant.

785
00:36:45.053 --> 00:36:47.488
According to
<i>Ye Olde Book of Powers,</i>


786
00:36:47.588 --> 00:36:49.690
all of today's superheroes
and villains


787
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:53.127
can trace their DNA back
to a few ancient villagers,


788
00:36:53.227 --> 00:36:56.030
who ate the seeds
of a mysterious plant,


789
00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.833
giving them superhuman powers.

790
00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:01.069
How are you British?

791
00:37:02.203 --> 00:37:04.138
The Hero League has been
secretly guarding it


792
00:37:04.238 --> 00:37:05.573
for centuries.

793
00:37:05.673 --> 00:37:07.308
Because in the wrong hands,
a person could create


794
00:37:07.408 --> 00:37:09.743
a super-powered army
to do their bidding.


795
00:37:10.411 --> 00:37:13.181
So how long were you stuck
to the toilet seats?


796
00:37:13.915 --> 00:37:15.183
Two days!

797
00:37:15.283 --> 00:37:16.951
Now tell us where
the Power Plant is,


798
00:37:17.051 --> 00:37:18.219
or the swoosh gets it!

799
00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:20.688
Not the swoosh!
Not the swoosh! Please!


800
00:37:20.788 --> 00:37:22.790
See, now you know
we're telling the truth.


801
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:25.526
He'd give up his own grandmother
to save his swoosh.


802
00:37:26.294 --> 00:37:28.462
I guess Thunder Man knows
how to keep a secret.


803
00:37:28.562 --> 00:37:30.965
Looks like we'll have to get it
out of him ourselves.


804
00:37:31.065 --> 00:37:33.501
So, what do we do with them?

805
00:37:34.202 --> 00:37:36.404
We'll take them
to the Mayhem Cafe.


806
00:37:36.504 --> 00:37:39.573
Mayhem Cafe.
Doesn't sound so bad.


807
00:37:41.742 --> 00:37:43.544
Do you ever get tired
of being wrong?


808
00:37:43.644 --> 00:37:45.279
Yeah, sometimes.

809
00:37:45.379 --> 00:37:47.481
Welcome to my dad's old lair.

810
00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:50.284
An homage to his hatred
of the Thundermans.


811
00:37:51.252 --> 00:37:53.854
Oh, how he longed
to trap you all in this booth


812
00:37:53.955 --> 00:37:55.957
and inflict its torments on you.

813
00:37:56.457 --> 00:37:58.026
And we had
my birthday parties here.


814
00:37:58.126 --> 00:38:00.428
Those parties
were smashing!


815
00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:02.063
You'll never get away with this.

816
00:38:02.163 --> 00:38:04.798
Our family will come looking as
soon as they realize we're gone.


817
00:38:04.899 --> 00:38:07.768
Oh? Did you tell them
where you were going?


818
00:38:09.703 --> 00:38:10.838
I knew it.

819
00:38:10.939 --> 00:38:14.542
Families are just a burden
to talents like us.


820
00:38:14.642 --> 00:38:15.743
But don't worry,

821
00:38:15.843 --> 00:38:17.111
we'll say hi for you.

822
00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:18.779
Fire up the jet!

823
00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:21.482
Destination: Hiddenville!

824
00:38:29.523 --> 00:38:31.659

Tortures?

828
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.835
Like being trapped in here
with you isn't torture enough?


829
00:38:45.106 --> 00:38:48.042
<i>Greetings, Max and Phoebe.</i>

- No!


836
00:38:58.119 --> 00:38:59.853
<i>Great. Let's begin.</i>

837
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:02.723
<i>Phoebe,</i>

838
00:39:02.823 --> 00:39:05.226
<i>you've tangled with some</i>
<i>monstrous villains in your day.</i>


839
00:39:05.326 --> 00:39:07.861
<i>But are you prepared</i>
<i>for the horror of</i>


840
00:39:07.962 --> 00:39:09.730
<i>Max's old gym socks?</i>

841
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.436
So this is where my socks went!

842
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.440
It smells like wet dog
dipped in hot trash.


843
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.310
Come on, it's not that bad.

844
00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.878
Let's add some lightning
to the mix.


845
00:39:24.979 --> 00:39:26.180
Uh, what?

846
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.881
Ow! Ow!

847
00:39:27.982 --> 00:39:29.984
- Ow!
- No! Ow! Oh, my butt!


848
00:39:30.084 --> 00:39:31.719
Ah! Ah!

849
00:39:31.819 --> 00:39:35.923
Max, your threshold for pain
is high,


850
00:39:36.024 --> 00:39:37.391
but can it withstand

851
00:39:37.491 --> 00:39:40.461
Phoebe's middle school
valedictorian speech?


852
00:39:40.561 --> 00:39:44.598
<i>And so, as we embark</i>
<i>on our next chapter of life...</i>


853
00:39:44.698 --> 00:39:46.967
Ugh! Can I do more lightning
instead?


854
00:39:47.068 --> 00:39:50.371
<i>...let's thank the teachers</i>
<i>who helped us on our journey.</i>


855
00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:53.841
<i>Mrs. Cunningham,</i>
<i>who taught us to love calculus.</i>


856
00:39:53.941 --> 00:39:55.109
Oh!

857
00:39:55.209 --> 00:39:56.544
Turn it off!

858
00:39:57.178 --> 00:40:01.149
<i>Monsieur Dworkin, who made us</i>
<i>say "oui" to French...</i>


859
00:40:01.249 --> 00:40:04.118
No!

860
00:40:09.257 --> 00:40:10.691
How was your day
at the skatepark, Chloe?


861
00:40:10.791 --> 00:40:12.793
Mom and Dad spied on me
from a helicopter.


862
00:40:12.893 --> 00:40:15.563
Then crashed in front of all
my friends. How was school?


863
00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:17.631
Nora and I used our powers
to compete for friends


864
00:40:17.731 --> 00:40:19.767
and then we seared off
the principal's ponytail.


865
00:40:19.867 --> 00:40:20.968
- Good talk.
- Yeah.


866
00:40:21.802 --> 00:40:23.871
Kids, have you seen Max
and Phoebe?


867
00:40:23.971 --> 00:40:25.139
They've been gone all day.

868
00:40:25.239 --> 00:40:27.541
Did you try using binoculars?

869
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.679
I told you she was still mad.

870
00:40:32.313 --> 00:40:34.148
What's that?

871
00:40:34.248 --> 00:40:35.649
It sounds like the Thunder Jet.

872
00:40:35.749 --> 00:40:38.686
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>
<i>V-Team approaching.</i>


873
00:40:38.786 --> 00:40:40.621
V-Team?
What are they doing here?


874
00:40:40.721 --> 00:40:43.324
Maybe their band is playing
Hiddenville!


875
00:40:46.794 --> 00:40:48.229
Lasering the lock?

876
00:40:48.329 --> 00:40:50.798
Classic rock star!

877
00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:52.666
Nobody move!

878
00:40:54.402 --> 00:40:56.404
Dad!

879
00:40:58.038 --> 00:41:00.141
That's the V
-Team?

880
00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:02.243
Yup, it sure is.

881
00:41:02.343 --> 00:41:05.045
Hey, guys, it's your old
camp counselor,


882
00:41:05.146 --> 00:41:06.780
Dr. Colosso.

883
00:41:07.215 --> 00:41:08.582
Dr. Colosso was a human

884
00:41:08.682 --> 00:41:10.951
with beady eyes
and sweating issues.


885
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:14.222
And you used to have freckles.
What's your point?


886
00:41:14.322 --> 00:41:16.590
Hand over the Power Plant,
Thunder Man!


887
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:19.193
- Power Plant? Never heard of it.
- No?


888
00:41:19.293 --> 00:41:21.329
Maybe this will help you
remember.


889
00:41:24.865 --> 00:41:27.067
<i>- Bees, they're everywhere!</i>
<i>- Make it stop!</i>


890
00:41:27.168 --> 00:41:28.802
My babies! Hank!

891
00:41:28.902 --> 00:41:30.804
Please, give them
what they want.


892
00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:33.274
If I do,

893
00:41:33.374 --> 00:41:35.343
will you tell us where
Max and Phoebe are?


894
00:41:35.443 --> 00:41:36.910
Of course.

895
00:41:58.132 --> 00:41:59.267
What is it, Dad?

896
00:41:59.367 --> 00:42:02.102
Something I vowed
to protect forever.


897
00:42:04.472 --> 00:42:05.973
Look at it!

898
00:42:06.073 --> 00:42:07.708
Each red pod teeming with seeds,

899
00:42:07.808 --> 00:42:11.145
enough to make
ten thousand supervillains!


900
00:42:12.313 --> 00:42:14.047
What if it's a fake?

901
00:42:14.782 --> 00:42:15.916
Good point.

902
00:42:16.016 --> 00:42:17.285
Better test it.

903
00:42:17.385 --> 00:42:20.154
Who here doesn't have
superpowers?


904
00:42:21.289 --> 00:42:22.423
Nutty!

905
00:42:22.523 --> 00:42:24.158
I told you to stay in the lair.

906
00:42:30.931 --> 00:42:32.132
You fiend!

907
00:42:32.233 --> 00:42:34.067
He's just a dumb squirrel.

908
00:42:38.306 --> 00:42:41.409
Did I say dumb?
I meant really cool.


909
00:42:43.744 --> 00:42:44.778
Whoa!

910
00:42:44.878 --> 00:42:45.979
Mad squirrel!

911
00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:47.448
Gah!

912
00:42:51.752 --> 00:42:53.554
- Yup, it's real.
- To the jet!


913
00:42:53.654 --> 00:42:55.556
Wait, what about Max
and Phoebe?


914
00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:57.525
You said you'd tell us
where they are!


915
00:42:57.625 --> 00:42:59.427
We're villains, we lied!

916
00:43:02.663 --> 00:43:04.798
I can't wait
for their new album.


917
00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:07.235
Hank, what do we do?

918
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:10.103
I'll follow their jet and hope
they lead me to him.


919
00:43:10.204 --> 00:43:12.206
Thunder Man, away!

920
00:43:14.174 --> 00:43:15.676
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>

921
00:43:15.776 --> 00:43:18.479

922
00:43:18.579 --> 00:43:20.381
<i>materializing over Hiddenville.</i>

923
00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:23.083
A dome?
Do they have that power?


924
00:43:31.925 --> 00:43:33.594
Daddy go boom.

925
00:43:49.943 --> 00:43:51.945
Aah! Bees, they're everywhere.

926
00:43:52.045 --> 00:43:53.213
Make it stop!

927
00:43:56.284 --> 00:43:57.518
Where'd they go?

928
00:43:57.618 --> 00:44:00.220
<i>That concludes</i>
<i>the simulated bees portion</i>

930
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:03.257
Simulated?

931
00:44:03.357 --> 00:44:05.192
They seem so real.

932
00:44:07.695 --> 00:44:09.597
<i>Well, this was fun.</i>

Whoa!

941
00:44:28.982 --> 00:44:31.051
- Max, what is that?
- I'm not sure.


942
00:44:31.151 --> 00:44:32.353
I'll try to freeze it.

943
00:44:34.855 --> 00:44:36.957
Nothing. I'll try heat breath.

944
00:44:39.293 --> 00:44:40.994
<i>Liquid mercury,</i>

945
00:44:41.094 --> 00:44:43.331

<i>Goodbye, Max and Phoebe.</i>

949
00:44:58.346 --> 00:44:59.980
The glass is unbreakable

950
00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.715
and the mercury's impervious
to our powers.


951
00:45:01.815 --> 00:45:03.484
Max, what about our twin power?

952
00:45:03.584 --> 00:45:05.786
Ew! You want us to hold hands?

953
00:45:05.886 --> 00:45:07.388
Would you rather drown
in liquid mercury?


954
00:45:07.488 --> 00:45:08.822
Kind of.

955
00:45:09.723 --> 00:45:11.325
Fine, all right.

956
00:45:15.996 --> 00:45:17.931
Didn't even crack it!

957
00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:20.233
Maybe this really is the end.

958
00:45:21.335 --> 00:45:22.603
Yeah.

959
00:45:24.605 --> 00:45:25.773
Phoebe, I want to apologize.

960
00:45:25.873 --> 00:45:27.941
Yeah, "Dweeb Force"
was kind of hurtful!


961
00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:30.143
No, not that.

962
00:45:30.243 --> 00:45:32.212
I meant,
my quest for fame,


963
00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:34.615
it was selfish and annoying.

964
00:45:34.715 --> 00:45:37.217
Oh. Max, it doesn't matter now.

965
00:45:37.317 --> 00:45:39.186
No, I want to explain.

966
00:45:39.286 --> 00:45:42.723
The reason I wanted to be famous
was because...


967
00:45:43.657 --> 00:45:46.193
because I know you're
a better supe than I am.


968
00:45:46.293 --> 00:45:47.628
What do you mean?

969
00:45:47.728 --> 00:45:49.863
See, I can never work
as hard as you


970
00:45:49.963 --> 00:45:52.633
and make all those
amazing plans.


971
00:45:52.733 --> 00:45:55.268
I thought, if I couldn't be
as good as you,


972
00:45:55.369 --> 00:45:57.905
maybe I could be more famous.

973
00:45:59.206 --> 00:46:00.508
That's funny.

974
00:46:00.608 --> 00:46:03.076
The whole reason I wanted to be
the best is because of you.


975
00:46:03.877 --> 00:46:05.145
What do you mean?

976
00:46:05.245 --> 00:46:06.780
I mean, when you were evil,
it was easy


977
00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.649
to be Mom and Dad's
favorite.


978
00:46:08.749 --> 00:46:11.385
Then you became
this great superhero


979
00:46:11.485 --> 00:46:13.220
and I didn't feel as special.

980
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.389
I thought maybe if I could be
the best supe ever,


981
00:46:15.489 --> 00:46:17.591
I could get that feeling back.

982
00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:19.927
No wonder our family
hated working with us.


983
00:46:20.027 --> 00:46:21.695
We were just thinking
of ourselves.


984
00:46:21.795 --> 00:46:23.664
I know, we've both been
a couple of total


985
00:46:23.764 --> 00:46:25.198
party favors.

986
00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:27.835
I would have gone with "jerks"
but...


987
00:46:27.935 --> 00:46:30.671
No, Max, look.
A leftover party favor bag


988
00:46:30.771 --> 00:46:32.272
from one of Mayhem Jr.'s
old birthdays.


989
00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:34.274
You know what supervillains
give as party favors?


990
00:46:34.374 --> 00:46:36.243
- Dangerous things.
- Uh-huh!


991
00:46:36.343 --> 00:46:37.878
Maybe our telekinesis can reach.

992
00:46:41.582 --> 00:46:43.851
Jackpot!
Let's see what we've got.


993
00:46:44.818 --> 00:46:46.987
- Brass knuckles.
- A vile of poison.


994
00:46:47.087 --> 00:46:49.423
Exploding sushi
refrigerator magnet!


995
00:46:49.523 --> 00:46:50.724
Hello!

996
00:46:50.824 --> 00:46:52.726
I bet the fish eggs
contain nitroglycerin.


997
00:46:52.826 --> 00:46:54.895
Hang on, this might get messy.

998
00:47:06.507 --> 00:47:07.675
We did it!

999
00:47:07.775 --> 00:47:09.743
Dark Mayhem could never
outsmart us.


1000
00:47:09.843 --> 00:47:11.512
<i>
- Unauthorized escape.</i>

1001
00:47:11.612 --> 00:47:14.314
<i>Instituting emergency protocol.</i>

1002
00:47:15.949 --> 00:47:18.886
<i>Lair will self-destruct</i>
<i>in 20 minutes.</i>


1003
00:47:21.021 --> 00:47:22.690
Unless he rigged his lair
to blow up.


1004
00:47:27.595 --> 00:47:29.830
Here, Hank,
it's a bag of frozen peas.


1005
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:31.899
Oh, thanks. I'm starving.

1006
00:47:32.633 --> 00:47:34.067
They're for your head.

1007
00:47:35.669 --> 00:47:37.270
Boy, that must have been
some hit.


1008
00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:39.039
The dome's too strong, Barb.

1009
00:47:39.139 --> 00:47:41.341
Chloe can't even teleport out.

1010
00:47:42.075 --> 00:47:43.811
Hey, look what I found.

1011
00:47:43.911 --> 00:47:46.013
A blue seed pod?

1012
00:47:46.547 --> 00:47:49.650
Must have fallen off the Power
Plant when the V-Team ran out.


1013
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:51.585
If the red ones make
supervillains,


1014
00:47:51.685 --> 00:47:53.386
do the blue ones make
superheroes?


1015
00:47:53.487 --> 00:47:55.623
They do. Wait a minute.

1016
00:47:56.056 --> 00:47:58.726
Are you saying what I think
you're saying?


1017
00:47:59.593 --> 00:48:02.496
<i>Don't panic,</i>
<i>Billy, you got this.</i>


1018
00:48:02.596 --> 00:48:04.231
<i>It's just a simple yes or no.</i>

1019
00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:06.366
<i>You have half a chance</i>
<i>of being right.</i>


1020
00:48:07.701 --> 00:48:09.102
Albuquerque!

1021
00:48:11.705 --> 00:48:13.607
Hank,
where is the nearest place


1022
00:48:13.707 --> 00:48:15.075
that the dome
touches the ground?


1023
00:48:15.175 --> 00:48:17.745
Uh, the city limits
in Hiddenville Park.


1024
00:48:17.845 --> 00:48:19.613
Kids, gather everyone we know

1025
00:48:19.713 --> 00:48:21.048
and meet us in the park.

1026
00:48:21.148 --> 00:48:23.517
Tell them we need their help
to save Max and Phoebe.


1027
00:48:23.617 --> 00:48:24.685
- Right.
- Right!


1028
00:48:24.785 --> 00:48:26.754
Albuquerque!

1029
00:48:33.026 --> 00:48:34.595
Hello, Animal Control?

1030
00:48:34.695 --> 00:48:36.063
I am a human homeowner

1031
00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:38.198
with a bit
of a squirrel problem.


1032
00:48:39.299 --> 00:48:40.333
Is it urgent?

1033
00:48:42.402 --> 00:48:43.771
Yeah, you might say that.

1034
00:48:48.175 --> 00:48:50.611
Excuse me. Thanks for coming,
everyone.


1035
00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:52.646
What's this all about,
Thunderman?


1036
00:48:52.746 --> 00:48:54.047
I'll tell you what it's about.

1037
00:48:54.147 --> 00:48:56.684
These super-dummies are back
for two days


1038
00:48:56.784 --> 00:48:59.086
and suddenly we live
in a snow globe.


1039
00:48:59.687 --> 00:49:01.054
I don't have time to explain,

1040
00:49:01.154 --> 00:49:03.857
but Max and Phoebe
are in mortal danger.


1041
00:49:03.957 --> 00:49:04.925
They need your help.

1042
00:49:05.025 --> 00:49:06.760
Dude, say no more.

1043
00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.562
- I'm in.
- Me too.


1044
00:49:08.662 --> 00:49:10.831
Anything for Barb.

1045
00:49:12.132 --> 00:49:14.534
Why should we help Max
and Phoebe?


1046
00:49:14.635 --> 00:49:16.236
They're so annoying!

1047
00:49:16.336 --> 00:49:19.707
Yeah, their mini-me
zapped off my ponytail.


1048
00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:22.409
And now Janet says
she wants to...


1049
00:49:22.509 --> 00:49:24.044
take a break.

1050
00:49:24.477 --> 00:49:26.446
Come on. Let's go!

1051
00:49:29.516 --> 00:49:31.218
Hey! Listen up.

1052
00:49:31.318 --> 00:49:34.354
Max and Phoebe have always
been there for you guys.


1053
00:49:34.454 --> 00:49:35.522
Don't you even remember?

1054
00:49:35.623 --> 00:49:36.857
I do.

1055
00:49:36.957 --> 00:49:38.726
Like that time
they saved the prom.


1056
00:49:38.826 --> 00:49:40.093
And kept that Candy girl

1057
00:49:40.193 --> 00:49:42.195
from turning the town
into mindless zombies.


1058
00:49:42.295 --> 00:49:44.464
Oh, I was gonna say
the prom one,


1059
00:49:44.564 --> 00:49:46.099
but there's probably others.

1060
00:49:47.434 --> 00:49:49.603
So now it's your turn
to help them.


1061
00:49:49.703 --> 00:49:51.571
So quit being a bunch
of weenies,


1062
00:49:51.672 --> 00:49:53.306
and get with the program.

1063
00:49:56.276 --> 00:49:57.945
Fine!

1064
00:49:58.478 --> 00:49:59.880
Whatever!

1065
00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.449
I don't have a ponytail anymore,
so who cares?


1066
00:50:03.884 --> 00:50:04.885
So what do you need from us?

1067
00:50:04.985 --> 00:50:05.953
I just need you guys

1068
00:50:06.053 --> 00:50:07.120
to open up your mouths

1069
00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.056
for the next few seconds.

1070
00:50:09.156 --> 00:50:11.124
I knew they'd make it weird.

1071
00:50:12.425 --> 00:50:13.627
Ready?

1072
00:50:19.199 --> 00:50:21.468
Another Thunderman floppo.

1073
00:50:21.568 --> 00:50:23.036
Well, back to my horrible life.

1074
00:50:25.673 --> 00:50:27.808
What the-
- My pants just ripped!

1075
00:50:27.908 --> 00:50:30.678
Aah!

1076
00:50:30.778 --> 00:50:32.012
Ah!

1077
00:50:32.813 --> 00:50:36.383
Holy handballs, I'm huge!

1078
00:50:37.417 --> 00:50:39.219
And blue!

1079
00:50:40.553 --> 00:50:42.389
I have an iron fist!

1080
00:50:44.925 --> 00:50:48.028
Oh! My fingers shoot
pretty sparkles!


1081
00:50:52.232 --> 00:50:55.635
Ah! I'm a human tornado!

1082
00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.242
I have awesome power burps.

1083
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:05.378
- It worked!
- Okay, everyone,


1084
00:51:05.478 --> 00:51:07.480
we need to concentrate
our powers on the dome


1085
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.749
and try to bust it open.

1086
00:51:08.849 --> 00:51:12.285
Come on, everyone gather.
Gather! Good.


1087
00:51:12.385 --> 00:51:14.654
And... Hit it!

1088
00:51:25.032 --> 00:51:27.100
I think it's working!

1089
00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:35.575
Guys, we did it!

1090
00:51:36.443 --> 00:51:38.611
Thundermans, assemble!

1091
00:51:40.147 --> 00:51:42.515
Chloe, do you think
you could teleport us all


1092
00:51:42.615 --> 00:51:43.616
back to Metroburg?

1093
00:51:43.717 --> 00:51:45.485
I think so. Everyone hold hands.

1094
00:51:51.224 --> 00:51:54.527
<i>Self-destruct in 45 seconds.</i>

1095
00:51:55.996 --> 00:51:58.265
Max, I found the keypad
to the security system,


1096
00:51:58.365 --> 00:51:59.699
but it requires a password.

1097
00:52:00.868 --> 00:52:02.302
I'll try "evil."

1098
00:52:02.402 --> 00:52:04.037
Nothing.

1099
00:52:04.137 --> 00:52:06.940
Try "Beyonce."
Who doesn't like Beyonce?


1100
00:52:08.475 --> 00:52:11.478
Still nothing.
Plus, I feel dumber.


1101
00:52:12.813 --> 00:52:14.181
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

1102
00:52:14.681 --> 00:52:16.216
Any chance this is just
a horrible dream?


1103
00:52:16.316 --> 00:52:17.851
We'll know in eighteen seconds.

1104
00:52:18.518 --> 00:52:21.221
There they are!

1105
00:52:22.622 --> 00:52:25.492
This place is about to blow up.
We don't know the password.


1106
00:52:25.592 --> 00:52:28.095
What? Grab our hands.
We'll teleport out of here.


1107
00:52:28.195 --> 00:52:30.497
We can't! It takes me a minute
to recharge.


1108
00:52:30.597 --> 00:52:33.000
<i>- Five... four... three...</i>
- Password, huh?


1109
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.368
<i>- ...two... one...</i>
- Think I might know it.


1110
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:40.573
<i>System punched.</i>
<i>Sequence canceled.</i>


1111
00:52:41.875 --> 00:52:44.044
- Oh!
- Yeah!


1112
00:52:44.144 --> 00:52:46.579
Dad, you did it!

1113
00:52:47.447 --> 00:52:48.916
But how did you guys find us?

1114
00:52:49.016 --> 00:52:50.683
Well, it was the only
building in town


1115
00:52:50.784 --> 00:52:52.252
with a neon sign saying,

1116
00:52:52.352 --> 00:52:54.321
"Die, Thundermans, die," so.

1117
00:52:54.855 --> 00:52:57.891
Guys, why didn't you tell us
the V-Team were villains?


1118
00:52:57.991 --> 00:52:59.626
We should have.
We were so desperate


1119
00:52:59.726 --> 00:53:02.262
to get our glory back,
we weren't thinking straight.


1120
00:53:02.362 --> 00:53:05.198
We totally get why you didn't
want to work with us before.


1121
00:53:05.999 --> 00:53:07.234
Could you ever forgive us?

1122
00:53:07.334 --> 00:53:09.202
Let me guess, you thought
you were gonna die,


1123
00:53:09.302 --> 00:53:10.904
admitted a bunch of personal
stuff to each other?


1124
00:53:11.004 --> 00:53:12.339
- Exactly.
- Pretty much.


1125
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:15.175
Yes, of course we forgive you.

1126
00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:17.410
But, guys, we have to stop
the V-Team


1127
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.012
from creating an army
of villains.


1128
00:53:19.112 --> 00:53:21.548
They got the Power Plant?
We have to find them!


1129
00:53:21.648 --> 00:53:24.384
Well, if I wanted to rain seeds
down on everyone,


1130
00:53:24.484 --> 00:53:26.854
I'd start at the highest point
in Metroburg.


1131
00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:28.621
Where's that?

1132
00:53:28.721 --> 00:53:30.090
<i>You know this, Billy.</i>

1133
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.792
<i>It was on the sign that you got</i>
<i>for that kid.</i>


1134
00:53:32.893 --> 00:53:34.427
<i>Think.</i>

1135
00:53:34.527 --> 00:53:35.495
<i>Think!</i>

1136
00:53:36.229 --> 00:53:38.198
The highest point in Metroburg
is Mt. Metroburg,


1137
00:53:38.298 --> 00:53:41.401
with an elevation
of 14,220 feet.


1138
00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:47.307
Guys, why is everyone
just standing around?


1139
00:53:47.407 --> 00:53:48.308
Quiet.

1140
00:53:48.408 --> 00:53:50.743
We're savoring the moment.

1141
00:53:59.219 --> 00:54:01.454
I've finished grinding the seeds
into dust.


1142
00:54:01.554 --> 00:54:03.023
Place it in the containment
hatch.


1143
00:54:03.123 --> 00:54:05.158
What's the magic word?

1144
00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.296
Right away.

1145
00:54:11.965 --> 00:54:13.566
You broke us out of prison

1146
00:54:13.666 --> 00:54:15.602
to sit on a freezing
mountaintop?


1147
00:54:15.702 --> 00:54:17.971
Strongdor doesn't like missing
bingo night.


1148
00:54:18.071 --> 00:54:19.772
Strongdor like bingo.

1149
00:54:20.373 --> 00:54:21.508
We brought you here
so you can see


1150
00:54:21.608 --> 00:54:24.011
what a real evil plan
looks like.


1151
00:54:24.111 --> 00:54:26.579
Oh! They're doing
our Macarena thing.


1152
00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:30.583
No, we're launching a drone

1153
00:54:30.683 --> 00:54:33.186
to rain red-powdered seeds
down on everyone,


1154
00:54:33.286 --> 00:54:35.788
and morph them
into an army of supervillains!


1155
00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:37.824
I guess that's pretty cool.

1156
00:54:38.725 --> 00:54:41.261
Then we three will subjugate
the superheroes of the world


1157
00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:43.230
and rule like emperors!

1158
00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:45.265
And give your dads cushy jobs?

1159
00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:48.468
Oh, let me think about that. No.

1160
00:54:48.568 --> 00:54:52.305
Wow, Mayhem, your kid <i>hates</i> you.

1161
00:54:52.973 --> 00:54:54.041
Shut it, Dad.

1162
00:54:54.141 --> 00:54:56.043
You don't always
have to say things.


1163
00:54:56.676 --> 00:54:59.179
Do not snap that claw at me,
young lady.


1164
00:54:59.279 --> 00:55:01.915
Anyway, I recalibrated
the thrust transducers


1165
00:55:02.015 --> 00:55:03.750
so we can rule the world
and junk.


1166
00:55:04.651 --> 00:55:05.852
Excellent!

1167
00:55:05.953 --> 00:55:09.222
Let the era of villainy begin!

1168
00:55:13.726 --> 00:55:15.462
Step away from the drone,
V-Team.


1169
00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:16.896
- Thundermans!
- Thundermans!


1170
00:55:16.997 --> 00:55:18.398
- Dark Mayhem!
- Electress!


1171
00:55:18.498 --> 00:55:21.301
- King Crab?
- And me, Strongdor!


1172
00:55:22.169 --> 00:55:23.903
Attack on my order!

1173
00:55:24.004 --> 00:55:25.305
No, Dad, this is our thing!

1174
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:27.740
Yes, the Thundermans
will just spank your bottoms


1175
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.176
like they always do.

1176
00:55:29.276 --> 00:55:30.643
Hey, our bottoms are firm.

1177
00:55:30.743 --> 00:55:33.546
We take spin class with
Warden Patty three days a week.


1178
00:55:35.215 --> 00:55:37.050
Thundermans, attack!

1179
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.189
It's been a long time, Max.

1180
00:55:42.289 --> 00:55:44.757
- Not long enough.
- Aw, come now.


1181
00:55:44.857 --> 00:55:45.993
Don't you want to...

1182
00:55:46.093 --> 00:55:47.394
catch up?

1183
00:55:54.034 --> 00:55:55.268
How'd you escape my dad's lair?

1184
00:55:55.368 --> 00:55:57.870
'Cause I'm a superhero,
not a brat with a mask.


1185
00:56:00.007 --> 00:56:01.541
Nice mask.

1186
00:56:11.784 --> 00:56:13.086
Mom, I wanna help.

1187
00:56:13.186 --> 00:56:14.387
No, sweetie, it's too dangerous.

1188
00:56:14.487 --> 00:56:16.623
Stay back here and don't move.

1189
00:56:16.723 --> 00:56:18.791
Have at you, sir.

1190
00:56:23.763 --> 00:56:28.235
Your super-punches are no match
for this barnacled beauty.


1191
00:56:31.038 --> 00:56:32.505
Ugh!

1192
00:56:35.075 --> 00:56:38.145
I can't fight you. I shoot
electricity from my hands.


1193
00:56:38.245 --> 00:56:39.646
All you have is a claw.

1194
00:56:39.746 --> 00:56:42.915
Oh, you're right.
I better do this.


1195
00:56:52.425 --> 00:56:54.127
I wonder if they like slap tag.

1196
00:57:04.804 --> 00:57:07.240
Billy, we can't keep
doing this forever.


1197
00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.741
Let's hope they don't know that.

1198
00:57:14.614 --> 00:57:15.415
Aah!

1199
00:57:21.054 --> 00:57:22.589
Ah! Oh!

1200
00:57:27.927 --> 00:57:29.962
Look around, Thunder Girl,

1201
00:57:30.063 --> 00:57:31.498
your family is doomed.

1202
00:57:35.235 --> 00:57:37.770
And they get to watch you
go first.


1203
00:57:41.108 --> 00:57:42.875
I can do this all night.

1204
00:57:54.354 --> 00:57:56.789
Say your prayers, Thunder Man.

1205
00:58:02.262 --> 00:58:03.430
Whoa!

1206
00:58:06.199 --> 00:58:07.300
Going ice skating?

1207
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.369
No, but you are.

1208
00:58:25.585 --> 00:58:27.654
Mom, hold out your hands.

1209
00:58:29.722 --> 00:58:31.991
<i>- * Let's kill tonight *</i>

1210
00:58:32.992 --> 00:58:35.462
<i>* Kill tonight *</i>

1211
00:58:35.562 --> 00:58:39.666
<i>* Show them all</i>
<i>you're not the ordinary type *</i>


1212
00:58:40.099 --> 00:58:42.101
- What the--
<i>- * Let's kill tonight *</i>


1213
00:58:42.202 --> 00:58:43.770
I hate where this is going.

1214
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:45.372
Oh!

1215
00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:50.243
First no bingo,
now meat in face.


1216
00:58:50.943 --> 00:58:53.180
This was your plan,
to make them even madder?


1217
00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.615
It'll work. Just wait for it.

1218
00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:58.785
- Billy!
- Wait!


1219
00:58:59.419 --> 00:59:00.587
Now!

1220
00:59:01.053 --> 00:59:02.155
Whoa!

1221
00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:09.028
Max!

1222
00:59:10.797 --> 00:59:11.731
Oh!

1223
00:59:13.065 --> 00:59:14.701
- Thanks, partner.
- Yeah.


1224
00:59:14.801 --> 00:59:16.936
- Your swoosh is messy.
- Don't care.


1225
00:59:17.036 --> 00:59:17.804
Let's finish this.

1226
00:59:17.904 --> 00:59:21.241
<i>* Let's kill tonight *</i>

1227
00:59:21.341 --> 00:59:23.410
<i>* Kill tonight *</i>

1228
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:26.279
<i>* Let's kill tonight *</i>

1229
00:59:26.379 --> 00:59:28.715
<i>* Kill tonight *</i>

1230
00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:32.919
<i>* Show them all</i>
<i>you're not the ordinary type *</i>


1231
00:59:33.786 --> 00:59:35.588
<i>* Let's kill tonight *</i>

1232
00:59:35.688 --> 00:59:36.689
Oh!

1233
00:59:40.026 --> 00:59:41.594
Guys, we did it!

1234
00:59:41.694 --> 00:59:43.463
- Hey, hey!
- See?


1235
00:59:43.563 --> 00:59:45.765
Nothing's stronger than family.

1236
00:59:45.865 --> 00:59:48.368
Except... evil!

1237
00:59:48.468 --> 00:59:49.969
No!

1238
00:59:57.143 --> 00:59:59.279
Dad, catch it before
it releases all the seeds.


1239
00:59:59.379 --> 01:00:01.581
I can't,
it's twice as fast as me.


1240
01:00:03.783 --> 01:00:05.452
What's the point, Max?

1241
01:00:05.552 --> 01:00:06.753
I already won.

1242
01:00:08.888 --> 01:00:13.059
I can't believe I put you
in my Bath Time Mix.


1243
01:00:15.027 --> 01:00:16.329
We have to do something.

1244
01:00:16.429 --> 01:00:17.764
If those seeds are released,
they'll create


1245
01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.299
tens of thousands
of supervillains


1246
01:00:19.399 --> 01:00:20.933
and this world turns evil
forever.


1247
01:00:22.502 --> 01:00:24.537
- I can do it.
- Do what, Chloe?


1248
01:00:24.637 --> 01:00:25.905
Teleport someone to the drone.

1249
01:00:26.005 --> 01:00:28.841
- What?
- No. No, out of the question.


1250
01:00:28.941 --> 01:00:31.444
Guys, I'm ready.

1251
01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:33.580
And I'm a Thunderman.

1252
01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.482
It's what we do.

1253
01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:37.149
Remind you of anyone?

1254
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:38.585
Yeah.

1255
01:00:39.352 --> 01:00:41.087
- Guys, I believe her.
- Me, too.


1256
01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.656
She wants to save the world,
Barb.


1257
01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.726
Okay, but your father and I
are going with you.


1258
01:00:46.826 --> 01:00:48.361
- No, no way. I'm going.
- Max!


1259
01:00:48.461 --> 01:00:51.764
Dad, that's an X-terra 5 drone,
okay? I know how it's wired.


1260
01:00:51.864 --> 01:00:53.800
And, Phoebe,
I'll need your telekinesis.


1261
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.868
To retrieve the seed container
and bring it back to Dad.


1262
01:00:55.968 --> 01:00:57.236
I don't know.

1263
01:00:57.337 --> 01:01:00.139
Uh, guys?
Evil drone flying away?


1264
01:01:01.007 --> 01:01:02.141
Come on.

1265
01:01:03.343 --> 01:01:05.011
We love you guys.

1266
01:01:05.111 --> 01:01:06.613
We love you too.

1267
01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.556
Great job, Chloe!
Hold on to that while we work.


1268
01:01:16.656 --> 01:01:18.291
I'll disable the power.

1269
01:01:18.391 --> 01:01:19.626
That'll release
the seed container


1270
01:01:19.726 --> 01:01:21.528
- so you can tele-k it out!
- Got it!


1271
01:01:31.604 --> 01:01:33.540
- You're good!
- Okay!


1272
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.278
- Got it!
- Okay, let's get out of here.


1273
01:01:39.379 --> 01:01:41.414
Without power, this thing's
gonna crash any second.


1274
01:01:43.816 --> 01:01:45.184
I can't see anything.

1275
01:01:45.284 --> 01:01:47.654
Phoebe!

1276
01:01:48.855 --> 01:01:51.424
I can't teleport us
unless we're all touching!


1277
01:01:51.524 --> 01:01:53.460
Phoebe, hurry,
we're going down fast!


1278
01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.094
Max, take the seeds!

1279
01:01:56.896 --> 01:01:59.131
- Got 'em!
- Go without me!


1280
01:01:59.231 --> 01:02:01.968
- What? No, we're not leaving!
- Don't be ridiculous.


1281
01:02:02.068 --> 01:02:03.936
Take Chloe and the seeds,
get back to the family.


1282
01:02:04.036 --> 01:02:06.906
Not gonna happen!
We're not a family without you!


1283
01:02:08.508 --> 01:02:10.710
I'll reach out!
Try to touch my hand.


1284
01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:12.879
Phoebe!

1285
01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:21.954
No. Please, no.

1286
01:02:22.054 --> 01:02:23.155
Hank...

1287
01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.928
Kids! What--

1288
01:02:29.028 --> 01:02:32.399
Chloe, you did it!
You saved the world!


1289
01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:34.767
- Here's these, Dad.
- Oh.


1290
01:02:34.867 --> 01:02:37.604
Also, I was wrong.

1291
01:02:37.704 --> 01:02:39.639
This one's gonna be
the best supe ever.


1292
01:02:39.739 --> 01:02:42.875
- You guys tied up the villains.
- Yeah, we did.


1293
01:02:42.975 --> 01:02:44.477
Can we go hit stuff
with their hammers?


1294
01:02:44.577 --> 01:02:46.679
- Of course.
- Go nuts.


1295
01:02:48.415 --> 01:02:50.917
- Good job, Chloe.
- Thanks, Dad.


1296
01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.919
We're sorry we treated you
like a little kid.


1297
01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.154
It's just...
you're growing up so fast,


1298
01:02:55.254 --> 01:02:57.156
we were afraid
you didn't need us anymore.


1299
01:02:57.256 --> 01:03:00.827
I'll always need you guys.
No matter how big I get.


1300
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:04.697
How come we never
talk like that?


1301
01:03:04.797 --> 01:03:07.500
- Because... shut up!
- Are you kidding me?


1302
01:03:12.439 --> 01:03:14.073
Five, six, seven.

1303
01:03:14.173 --> 01:03:15.942
- Oh!
- Up top!


1304
01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.210
Yeah!
Five hundred gumdrops, buddy.


1305
01:03:19.378 --> 01:03:21.848
Thunder chili is served.

1306
01:03:24.183 --> 01:03:27.319
Billy, we just got invited
to our first high school party.


1307
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.988
- Cool!
- Can I come?


1308
01:03:30.356 --> 01:03:32.859
Just kidding. Text me the deets.

1309
01:03:34.661 --> 01:03:36.629
You know,
I hate to admit it,


1310
01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:38.865
but I missed you guys
when you were gone.


1311
01:03:38.965 --> 01:03:41.701
- Even you, Hank.
- Thanks, Colosso.


1312
01:03:41.801 --> 01:03:43.703
And you missed me too, right?

1313
01:03:43.803 --> 01:03:46.405
Thanks, Colosso.

1314
01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:50.276
<i>Alert! Alert!</i>
<i>President Kickbutt approaching.</i>


1315
01:03:50.376 --> 01:03:51.911
What now?

1316
01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:57.784
Sorry to interrupt your evening,
Thundermans.


1317
01:03:57.884 --> 01:04:00.152
I've come to apologize.

1318
01:04:00.887 --> 01:04:02.188
- Really?
- Yes.


1319
01:04:02.288 --> 01:04:04.557
Firing the best superheroes
in the Hero League


1320
01:04:04.657 --> 01:04:07.093
was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.


1321
01:04:07.193 --> 01:04:10.463
And I once had dinner
with Inside-Out Man.


1322
01:04:12.499 --> 01:04:14.834
We understand. 
Rules are rules.

1323
01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:17.336
The rules said I had to fire you

1324
01:04:17.436 --> 01:04:18.971
for injuring a fellow supe.

1325
01:04:19.071 --> 01:04:22.975
But since the V-Team
weren't actually supes,


1326
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:25.945
I'd like to offer you
your jobs back.


1327
01:04:26.045 --> 01:04:28.314
If... you'll take them back.

1328
01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:34.721
We'll do it under one condition.

1329
01:04:34.821 --> 01:04:36.255
I'll name Phoebe my VP

1330
01:04:36.355 --> 01:04:39.859
and have a team of stylists
available to Max 24/7.


1331
01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:42.261
Not that, but thank you.

1332
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:46.766
We'd like this house to be
the new T-Force headquarters.


1333
01:04:46.866 --> 01:04:49.368
So we can always
put family first.


1334
01:04:51.403 --> 01:04:52.371
Well,

1335
01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:54.974
this is highly unusual...

1336
01:04:55.742 --> 01:04:59.411
and I'm honored to welcome the
T-Force back to the Hero League!


1337
01:05:01.447 --> 01:05:03.783
I'll have your badges and suits
delivered in the morning.


1338
01:05:03.883 --> 01:05:05.017
And the keys to the mega yacht.

1339
01:05:05.117 --> 01:05:06.586
And designer utility belt
collection.


1340
01:05:06.686 --> 01:05:07.987
All right!

1341
01:05:08.087 --> 01:05:09.589
Which one of you blabbermouths

1342
01:05:09.689 --> 01:05:11.157
spilled the beans?

1343
01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.461
Thunder Monitor?

1344
01:05:15.562 --> 01:05:17.363
<i>Way ahead of you.</i>

1345
01:05:20.232 --> 01:05:22.368
- And where were we?
- Let's get that chili going.


1346
01:05:22.468 --> 01:05:23.636
- Yeah!
- Yeah, let's!


1347
01:05:23.736 --> 01:05:25.237
Hang on.
Does anyone else


1348
01:05:25.337 --> 01:05:27.607
have the feeling
that we forgot something?


1349
01:05:30.577 --> 01:05:31.878
What was that?

1350
01:05:37.416 --> 01:05:39.619
The Blue Hunk,

1351
01:05:39.719 --> 01:05:42.121
reporting for duty.

1352
01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:44.824
Don't forget Iron Punch.

1353
01:05:44.924 --> 01:05:47.059
Ow! That was my foot.

1354
01:05:49.095 --> 01:05:51.831
Hey! You blew out my sparkles!

1355
01:05:54.934 --> 01:05:57.136
Where is everybody?

1356
01:05:57.970 --> 01:05:59.071
This might be a problem.

1357
01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:00.873
One we can deal with later?

1358
01:06:05.011 --> 01:06:06.846
Great! Back to Family Night.

1359
01:06:06.946 --> 01:06:08.114
- How about that chili?
- Let's go!


1360
01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:09.415
- Me first!
- Chili time!


1361
01:06:09.515 --> 01:06:11.951
I call butt groove!

1362
01:06:26.432 --> 01:06:28.701
<i>We've been</i>
<i>watching you, Colosso.</i>


1363
01:06:29.435 --> 01:06:31.170
<i>My colleagues and I</i>
<i>were wondering</i>


1364
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:34.841
<i>if you'd be interested</i>
<i>in a little assignment.</i>


1365
01:06:34.941 --> 01:06:37.076
I'm listening.
