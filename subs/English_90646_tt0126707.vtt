00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:23.431
Radio: MARINERS BE ADVISED,
[THUNDER]


2
00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:24.693
A VIOLENT STORM
IS CONVERGING


3
00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:26.869
ON THE NORTHERN
AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST


4
00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:28.523
WITH WINDS
UP TO HURRICANE FORCE.


5
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.526
Man: COAST GUARD BASE
MONTEREY,


6
00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.745
COME IN. COME IN.

7
00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:40.274
THERE'S NO POWER!

8
00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:42.102
THE PUMPS DON'T WORK!

9
00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:43.451
MAYDAY! MAYDAY!

10
00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:45.801
WE'RE SINKING! MAYDAY!

11
00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.504
RICK!

12
00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:54.549
RICK!

13
00:00:54.592 --> 00:00:56.377
JASON!

14
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.118
Susan: WHEN YOU'RE
FIGHTING FOR YOUR LIFE,


15
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:00.990
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A REASON
TO KEEP GOING.


16
00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:04.559
YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE SOMEONE
OR SOMETHING SO MUCH


17
00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:06.735
THAT YOU REFUSE TO GIVE UP.

18
00:01:06.778 --> 00:01:08.128
I FOUND MY REASON
AFTER OUR BOAT SANK


19
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:10.260
TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

45
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:22.898
I CAN HAVE
ANYTHING I WANT, RIGHT?


46
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:24.813
NOBODY LIKES
A SMUG WINNER.


47
00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:27.685
DEBBIE, GIVE HIM
THE CHEAPEST THING ON TAP.
NOTHING FOR ME.


48
00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.645
SO TELL ME ABOUT
THIS PROPOSAL OF YOURS.


49
00:02:30.688 --> 00:02:33.082
OK.

50
00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.431
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO MAKE GOOD MONEY


51
00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:36.999
ON A BEAUTIFUL BOAT
WITH A KILLER CREW?


52
00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:38.827
THIS GUY I SAILED WITH
LAST YEAR, RICK FOSTER,


53
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.612
HE'S BRINGING A 68-FOOT IRWIN
UP TO VANCOUVER NEXT WEEK, OK?


54
00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:43.919
IT'S A PRIVATE GIG.
HE'S DELIVERING IT
TO THE OWNER.


55
00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:44.920
WE NEED A CREW. WE...

56
00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:45.877
MATT, I DON'T KNOW.

57
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:47.357
COME ON.
IT'D BE A BLAST.


58
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.403
IT SOUNDS GREAT.
I'M SURE WE'D HAVE FUN.


59
00:02:49.446 --> 00:02:51.840
BUT YOU KNOW I'VE
GIVEN UP SAILING
FOR A WHILE.


60
00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:53.929
NOW, THAT'S THE MOST
TRAGIC THING
I'VE HEARD ALL DAY.


61
00:02:53.972 --> 00:02:54.669
HEY, HEY, HEY.

62
00:02:54.712 --> 00:02:56.192
RICK FOSTER.

63
00:02:56.236 --> 00:02:57.411
PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU,
MS. CLARKSON.


64
00:02:57.454 --> 00:02:59.195
NICE TO MEET YOU.

65
00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.805
YOU SNEAK. YOU PLANNED THIS,
DIDN'T YOU?


66
00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.024
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

67
00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:03.286
PLAN WAS
TO AMBUSH YOU.


68
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.854
NOW, TELL ME WHY
YOU'RE LANDLOCKED.


69
00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:07.290
BUNCH OF REASONS.

70
00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:08.987
I GOTTA SETTLE DOWN,
FIND A STEADY JOB.


71
00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:10.206
I UNDERSTAND.

72
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.295
IT'LL ONLY BE
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.


73
00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:13.470
OWNER WANTS
THE BOAT
IN VANCOUVER


74
00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:14.863
BY THE END
OF THE MONTH.


75
00:03:14.906 --> 00:03:17.039
I'LL PAY 500
PLUS EXPENSES.


76
00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:18.345
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

77
00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:19.302
EXCELLENT.

78
00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:21.173
WE SET SAIL
NEXT WEEK.


79
00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:22.697
BUT I CAN'T.

80
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.395
THANKS FOR THE OFFER.
I REALLY WISH I COULD.


81
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.006
IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU, RICK.


82
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.790
SEE YOU LATER, MATT.

83
00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:29.965
RIGHT.

84
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.490
I'LL CALL YOU.

85
00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:37.015
DON'T WORRY.
WE GOT OTHER PEOPLE
WE CAN GO TO.


86
00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.669
NOT LIKE HER.

87
00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:41.846
SO, MATT, HOW MUCH
OF THIS INTEREST
IS PROFESSIONAL?


88
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.978
ALL OF IT.

89
00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:48.810
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, MOST OF IT.


90
00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.551
ANY LUCK YESTERDAY?

91
00:03:50.594 --> 00:03:52.117
NOTHING I COULD HANDLE.

92
00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:56.513
$6.00 AN HOUR TO GIVE
BOAT RIDES TO TOURISTS
JUST ISN'T ME.


93
00:03:56.557 --> 00:03:59.255
MAYBE SOMETHING
WITHOUT BOATS WOULD
BE NICE FOR A CHANGE.


94
00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.083
MAYBE.

95
00:04:03.128 --> 00:04:04.521
SUSANNAH, I, UM...

96
00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:05.522
UH
-OH.

97
00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:07.568
UH
-OH WHAT?

98
00:04:07.611 --> 00:04:09.178
THAT'S WHAT YOU USED TO
CALL ME WHEN I WAS A KID


99
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:12.573
AND WE WERE GONNA
HAVE ONE OF OUR TALKS.


100
00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:15.358
BUT I CAN'T HELP NOT
WANTING YOU TO LEAVE
AGAIN, NOT YET,


101
00:04:15.402 --> 00:04:17.273
NOT WHEN I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE FINALLY STARTING
TO TALK.


102
00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:18.405
I'M NOT LEAVING.

103
00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:20.407
IN FACT, I JUST
TURNED DOWN AN OFFER


104
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.365
TO SAIL A 68-FOOTER
UP THE COAST.


105
00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:26.326
I WORRY SO MUCH
WHEN YOU'RE OUT THERE.


106
00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:27.805
I JUST WISH YOUR FATHER
HADN'T MADE YOU...


107
00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.112
HE DIDN'T MAKE ME
LOVE THE OCEAN.


108
00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:31.983
I JUST ALWAYS HAVE.

109
00:04:32.027 --> 00:04:33.420
IT'S LIKE I NEVER
HAD A CHOICE.


110
00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:37.511
SUCH A NOMADIC
LIFESTYLE.


111
00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:40.340
CONSTANTLY MOVING,
CHANGING FRIENDS.


112
00:04:40.383 --> 00:04:42.080
I NEVER KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE,
WHETHER YOU'RE SAFE.


113
00:04:42.124 --> 00:04:42.951
MOM, STOP PUSHING.

114
00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:07.976
GUESS WHO.

115
00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:09.934
SOMEONE WHO WON'T
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.


116
00:05:09.978 --> 00:05:11.980
COME ON. YOU'RE
GONNA TAKE THE REST
OF THE DAY OFF.


117
00:05:12.023 --> 00:05:13.808
IT'S 10:20. THE DAY
HASN'T EVEN STARTED.


118
00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:15.549
WELL, ALL THE MORE REASON
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.


119
00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:17.594
NO, I CAN'T.
I HAVE TO FIND A JOB.


120
00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:18.552
COME ON.

121
00:05:18.595 --> 00:05:20.292
NO, REALLY,
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.


122
00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:22.469
SO WHY IS
YOUR MOTHER


123
00:05:22.512 --> 00:05:24.296
SO DEAD SET
AGAINST SAILING?


124
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.602
MY DAD WAS A SAILOR.

125
00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:28.562
NOT SAILBOAT RACING.
YOU KNOW, SHIPYARD STUFF.


126
00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:30.520
HE LEFT
WHEN I WAS 10,


127
00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:32.870
TOOK A JOB
ON SOME OIL RIG,
AND THAT WAS THAT.


128
00:05:32.914 --> 00:05:35.307
WOW. I'M SORRY.

129
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:38.354
IT'S OK.
IT WAS YEARS AGO.


130
00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:40.574
SO WHY ARE YOU
TAKING THIS GIG?


131
00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:45.274
ALL I WANT TO DO IS
BUILD MY RACING BOAT,


132
00:05:45.317 --> 00:05:47.363
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M TAKING THIS JOB
WITH RICK.


133
00:05:47.407 --> 00:05:50.018
THAT'S WHY I TAKE
ALL MY JOBS.


134
00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:51.019
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

135
00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:52.150
THANK YOU.

136
00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:00.942
WOW.

137
00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:05.599
Matt: SHE'S A BEAUTY, HUH?

138
00:06:05.642 --> 00:06:08.166
GO ON. GO FOR IT. RICK
WANTS TO SHOW YOU AROUND.


139
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.516
KEEP AN OPEN MIND.

140
00:06:15.217 --> 00:06:17.785
NOT TOO SHABBY, HUH?

141
00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:18.742
IT'S AN IRWIN.

142
00:06:18.786 --> 00:06:21.528
BEAUTIFUL
CRAFTSMANSHIP.


143
00:06:21.571 --> 00:06:23.225
AND SHE'S
CERTAINLY GOT
ALL THE TOYS.


144
00:06:25.706 --> 00:06:27.838
SO, WHEN DID YOU DO
THE WHITBREAD?


145
00:06:27.882 --> 00:06:30.493
UM, HALFWAY THROUGH
MY SOPHOMORE YEAR
OF COLLEGE.

ALL THE WAY.

148
00:06:33.888 --> 00:06:36.325
WOW. HA.

149
00:06:36.368 --> 00:06:37.761
WELCOME TO "NO SWEAT"
SAILING.


150
00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:39.459
GO ON.

00:07:06.964 --> 00:07:09.401
I'M ALLIE.

160
00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:11.273
SO ARE YOU ON THE CREW?

161
00:07:11.316 --> 00:07:15.669
NO. THE ONLY THING
I DO ON A BOAT IS TAN.


162
00:07:15.712 --> 00:07:16.974
RICK'S MY BOYFRIEND.

163
00:07:17.018 --> 00:07:19.586
I'M JUST ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.


164
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:20.717
I THOUGHT I'D BE
THE ONLY WOMAN
ON BOARD, BUT...


165
00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:22.632
NO, I'M NOT GOING.

166
00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:25.287
OH, WELL.

167
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.551
GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE
TO HANDLE THOSE BOYS
ON MY OWN.


168
00:07:28.595 --> 00:07:30.335
NICE TO MEET YOU, SUSAN.

169
00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:32.599
SEE YOU LATER.

170
00:07:35.732 --> 00:07:37.299
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'LL BE FINE.


171
00:07:37.342 --> 00:07:39.562
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
WHY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME.


172
00:07:39.606 --> 00:07:40.389
WHAT, YOU WANNA BE
THE SKIPPER NOW,


173
00:07:40.432 --> 00:07:42.304
MAKE ALL
THE BIG DECISIONS?


174
00:07:42.347 --> 00:07:45.612
OF COURSE NOT, RICK.
I JUST THINK YOU'RE
PUSHING IT HERE, OK?


175
00:07:45.655 --> 00:07:48.136
AND I DON'T...
SUSAN. HEY.


176
00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:50.399
HEY. HOW'D IT GO?
WHAT'D YOU THINK?


177
00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:53.402
I JUST MET YOUR,
UM... ALLIE.


178
00:07:53.445 --> 00:07:54.577
OH, YEAH?

179
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:56.405
SHE'S KIND OF
HIGH MAINTENANCE.


180
00:07:56.448 --> 00:07:57.537
AMAZING, THOUGH.

181
00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.929
KIND OF
HIGH MAINTENANCE?


182
00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:02.280
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?


183
00:08:02.324 --> 00:08:05.109
NOTHING, JUST BUSINESS.

184
00:08:05.153 --> 00:08:06.676
SO, ANYWAY, SUSAN,

185
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.852
I DON'T LIKE TO BEG,

186
00:08:08.896 --> 00:08:11.725
BUT WE COULD REALLY
USE YOU ON THIS TRIP.


187
00:08:11.768 --> 00:08:13.727
YEAH. I KNOW YOU
WANT TO STAY DRY
FOR A WHILE,


188
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.119
BUT WE JUST
FOUND OUT THAT WE
HAVE LESS TIME


189
00:08:15.163 --> 00:08:17.513
TO MAKE VANCOUVER
THAN RICK THOUGHT.


190
00:08:17.557 --> 00:08:18.862
WE NEED
EXPERIENCED CREW
LIKE YOU.


191
00:08:20.908 --> 00:08:24.433
I WISH I COULD, REALLY,
BUT I PROMISED...


192
00:08:24.476 --> 00:08:25.695
WHO,
YOUR BOYFRIEND?


193
00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:26.696
MY MOTHER.

194
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.784
OH.

195
00:08:27.828 --> 00:08:29.133
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE UP
FOR LOST TIME,


196
00:08:29.177 --> 00:08:30.657
AND I TOLD HER
I'D HANG AROUND
FOR A WHILE.


197
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.920
JUST 8 DAYS, SUSAN.

198
00:08:32.963 --> 00:08:36.401
8 DAYS. I'LL PAY YOU

199
00:08:36.445 --> 00:08:38.229
WHY ARE YOU SO ANXIOUS?

200
00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:42.625
WELL, THE TRUTH...

201
00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:46.673
UM, I MESSED UP
ON MY LAST JOB.


202
00:08:46.716 --> 00:08:48.109
I MEAN...

203
00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:49.110
MESSED UP.

204
00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:52.113
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR DETAIL.


205
00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:54.245
I WAS GOING
THROUGH A HARD TIME,


206
00:08:54.289 --> 00:08:56.247
LET A FEW THINGS SLIDE,

207
00:08:56.291 --> 00:08:57.684
AND MY REPUTATION SANK.

208
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:04.125
I NEED THIS ONE
TO RE-ESTABLISH MYSELF.


209
00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:05.648
I'M A GOOD CAPTAIN

210
00:09:05.692 --> 00:09:08.695
WITH DOZENS
OF SUCCESSFUL RUNS
UNDER MY BELT, SUSAN.


211
00:09:08.738 --> 00:09:12.350
MY GOAL IS TO, UH...

212
00:09:12.394 --> 00:09:14.222
IS TO DELIVER EARLY.

213
00:09:14.265 --> 00:09:17.312
PERMISSION TO COME ABOARD!

214
00:09:17.355 --> 00:09:18.574
AYE, AYE, MATEY.

215
00:09:18.618 --> 00:09:20.663
JASON, MY MAN.

216
00:09:20.707 --> 00:09:23.231
HOW ARE YA?
GOOD.


217
00:09:23.274 --> 00:09:24.319
YOU KNOW MATT.

218
00:09:24.362 --> 00:09:25.320
HEY.

219
00:09:25.363 --> 00:09:27.801
AND SUSAN CLARKSON.

220
00:09:27.844 --> 00:09:28.976
SUSAN.

221
00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:31.413
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.


222
00:09:31.456 --> 00:09:32.806
JASON, HOW'S IT GOING?

223
00:09:32.849 --> 00:09:33.807
GOOD.

224
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.417
TAKE IT YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER.


225
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.159
YEAH. WELL, KIND OF.
WE GREW UP IN THE SAME TOWN.


226
00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:39.464
SMALL WORLD, HUH?

227
00:09:39.508 --> 00:09:42.337
YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

228
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.295
SO YOU GONNA BE
CREWING UP WITH US?


229
00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:46.254
I DON'T KNOW.

230
00:09:46.297 --> 00:09:47.647
MAYBE.

231
00:09:56.699 --> 00:09:58.092
Susan: THERE'S NOTHING WORSE

232
00:09:58.135 --> 00:10:00.398
THAN LOOKING FOR A JOB
YOU DON'T WANT.


233
00:10:00.442 --> 00:10:02.618
SAILING'S ALL I CARED ABOUT.

234
00:10:02.662 --> 00:10:06.404
EVERYTHING MY MOTHER HATED
ABOUT IT, I LOVED.


235
00:10:06.448 --> 00:10:08.493
MAYBE THAT WAS PART
OF THE ATTRACTION.


236
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:16.240
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET RID OF THOSE?


237
00:10:16.284 --> 00:10:18.982
BECAUSE I LIKE
TO KNOW I'M STRONGER
THAN THEY ARE.


238
00:10:19.026 --> 00:10:20.941
YOU'RE JUST MAKING IT
HARDER ON YOURSELF.


239
00:10:20.984 --> 00:10:23.378
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY?
YOU SHOULD REMOVE
THE TEMPTATION.


240
00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:25.597
THEY DON'T LIVE MY LIFE.
I DO.


241
00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:27.121
IT'S UP TO ME.

242
00:10:27.164 --> 00:10:29.950
AND YOU KNOW
HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU.


243
00:10:29.993 --> 00:10:32.126
I MEAN, 6 MONTHS SOBER
IS HUGE.


244
00:10:36.347 --> 00:10:37.522
BUT?

245
00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:42.571
BUT IT'S HARD
TO JUST... FORGET.


246
00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:47.402
I'M TRYING.
I REALLY AM.


247
00:10:47.445 --> 00:10:50.100
FOR SO MANY YEARS,
I MEAN...


248
00:10:50.144 --> 00:10:52.668
I CAME HOME NOT KNOWING
WHAT TO EXPECT.


249
00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:56.890
WOULD YOU BE DRUNK,
ANGRY, IRRATIONAL,
PASSED OUT...


250
00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:02.722
OR MY MOTHER?

251
00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:09.990
ALL I CAN SAY IS IT WAS
A VERY DIFFERENT TIME.


252
00:11:10.033 --> 00:11:14.472
I COUNTED ON YOUR FATHER
TO TAKE CARE OF ME,
AND WHEN HE DIDN'T...


253
00:11:14.516 --> 00:11:15.952
MY WORLD FELL APART.

254
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.524
AND THEN I TURNED AROUND
AND DID THE SAME THING
TO YOU.


255
00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:25.527
AND NO MATTER
HOW LONG IT TAKES,


256
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.789
I'M DETERMINED
TO PROVE TO YOU


257
00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:28.878
THAT THINGS
HAVE TRULY CHANGED.


258
00:11:30.053 --> 00:11:31.359
I HOPE THEY HAVE.

259
00:11:34.754 --> 00:11:37.060
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

260
00:11:37.104 --> 00:11:38.583
ISN'T THERE?

261
00:11:40.281 --> 00:11:42.370
YEAH, THERE IS.

262
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.506
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF...

263
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.770
IF I WENT AWAY
FOR JUST 2 WEEKS?


264
00:11:52.902 --> 00:11:54.904
LOOK, MOM...
SUSAN.


265
00:11:54.948 --> 00:11:56.340
I KNOW I SAID
WE WOULD STICK AROUND


266
00:11:56.384 --> 00:11:59.213

WE WILL. I PROMISE.

[ALARM SOUNDS]

483
00:22:33.194 --> 00:22:34.935
Jason: HEY, RICK!
GOT A PROBLEM DOWN HERE!


484
00:22:34.978 --> 00:22:36.066
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S
IN THE ENGINE ROOM.


485
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:37.111
ALL RIGHT.
HOLD HER, SUSAN.

SHE'S SLIPPING!

487
00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:50.124
OH, MAN.

488
00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:51.995
WE GOTTA GET

489

Susan: THE CURRENT'S
DRAGGING US INTO THE DOCK.

00:22:54.955 --> 00:22:56.565
IT'S JAMMED!

MATT, GET UP HERE!

00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:07.184
I'M HERE. I'M HERE.
TAKE THE HELM.


496
00:23:07.228 --> 00:23:09.143
I'M GONNA GO LET
THE JIB OUT.


497
00:23:11.101 --> 00:23:13.147
Matt: GET IT OUT QUICK!
Jason: I AM!


498
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:14.540
GET THE STERN!

499
00:23:14.583 --> 00:23:15.497

503
00:23:30.251 --> 00:23:31.992
COME ON.

504
00:23:34.951 --> 00:23:36.300
TOO CLOSE.

505
00:23:36.344 --> 00:23:37.998
Susan: GET READY
TO FEND OFF.


506
00:23:42.306 --> 00:23:44.004

WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.


507
00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.269
YEAH!

508
00:23:49.313 --> 00:23:50.227
WHOO.

509
00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:51.881
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

510
00:23:53.883 --> 00:23:55.494
I THOUGHT
WE WERE TOAST.


511
00:23:58.758 --> 00:23:59.976
WHAT HAPPENED?

512
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.413
IMPELLER WENT,
ENGINE OVERHEATED.


513
00:24:06.853 --> 00:24:08.115
WE'RE IN SAN PEDRO.

514
00:24:08.158 --> 00:24:09.290
Patricia:
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?


515
00:24:09.333 --> 00:24:10.944
GREAT. WE'RE
MAKING GOOD TIME.


516
00:24:10.987 --> 00:24:14.556
GOOD. I'M... I'M SORRY
I GOT SO ANGRY, SUSAN.


517
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.123
I JUST... I DON'T KNOW...

518
00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:17.690
I HATE IT WHEN
I GET LIKE THAT.


519
00:24:17.733 --> 00:24:18.734
I KNOW.

520
00:24:18.778 --> 00:24:20.606
SO WHEN DO YOU
THINK YOU'LL BE BACK?


521
00:24:20.649 --> 00:24:22.390
DEPENDS ON WHAT
THE OWNER HAS PLANNED.


522
00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:24.610
CAN'T BE SOON
ENOUGH FOR ME.


523
00:24:24.653 --> 00:24:26.350
MOM, LOOK, I GOTTA GO.

524
00:24:26.394 --> 00:24:27.787
I'LL CALL YOU FROM
MY NEXT STOP IN 2 DAYS, OK?


525
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:29.049
TAKE CARE.
I LOVE YOU.


526
00:24:29.092 --> 00:24:31.094
LOVE YOU, TOO.

527
00:24:31.138 --> 00:24:32.226
HOW'S MOM?

528
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:35.185
FINE, BUT SHE
WORRIES TOO MUCH.


529
00:24:35.229 --> 00:24:37.710
I DIDN'T TELL HER
HOW WE ARRIVED
IN SAN PEDRO.


530
00:24:37.753 --> 00:24:38.885
THAT SHOULD HAVE
NEVER HAPPENED.


531
00:24:38.928 --> 00:24:40.843
RICK SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN CARE OF THAT.


532
00:24:40.887 --> 00:24:42.366
DID YOU TELL HIM?

533
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.760
YEAH, I TOLD HIM
THE IMPELLER SHAFT
WAS RUSTY, YEAH.


534
00:24:44.804 --> 00:24:47.284
WELL, THAT IS
ONE OF THE PARTS
WE HAVE WAITING HERE.


535
00:24:47.328 --> 00:24:48.503
RICK NEVER SAID
IT WAS URGENT.


536
00:24:48.547 --> 00:24:50.897
I JUST FIGURED
IT WAS ROUTINE UPKEEP.


537
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.073
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED
IF THE ENGINE HADN'T
OVERHEATED, REALLY.


538
00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:54.335
THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.


539
00:24:54.378 --> 00:24:55.684
I MEAN, RICK
DROPPED THE BALL.


540
00:24:55.728 --> 00:24:57.643
HOW MUCH DO WE
REALLY KNOW ABOUT
THIS GUY ANYWAY?


541
00:24:57.686 --> 00:24:59.253
LOOK, GUYS,

542
00:24:59.296 --> 00:25:00.820
I'VE SAILED
WITH HIM, OK?


543
00:25:00.863 --> 00:25:01.995
AND I'VE
HUNG OUT WITH HIM
AT THE ROOST.


544
00:25:02.038 --> 00:25:03.649
HE SEEMS OK TO ME.

545
00:25:03.692 --> 00:25:05.781
LOOK, THE BOTTOM LINE IS
WITH US CREWING FOR HIM,


546
00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:08.915
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
NO MATTER WHAT,
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.


547
00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:12.135
YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'RE
ACTING LIKE THIS IS
SOME TRIP AROUND THE WORLD.


548
00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:13.702
COME ON. WE'D BETTER
HURRY UP AND GET
THOSE PARTS.


549
00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:15.225
HE WANTS TO
SHOVE OFF
RIGHT AFTER DINNER.


550
00:25:23.625 --> 00:25:26.410
I LIKED COLLEGE, BUT
I JUST COULDN'T HELP IT.


551
00:25:26.454 --> 00:25:28.587
I HAD TO GET AWAY, SAIL.

552
00:25:30.197 --> 00:25:32.765
I'M SORRY, BUT LIVING
ON ONE OF THESE THINGS
FOR 3 YEARS


553
00:25:32.808 --> 00:25:35.115
SOUNDS LIKE
A LIVING NIGHTMARE.


554
00:25:35.158 --> 00:25:37.204
AND FOR ME, IT WAS
A DREAM COME TRUE.


555
00:25:39.336 --> 00:25:41.904
YOU NEVER FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE IN PRISON,


556
00:25:41.948 --> 00:25:44.211
JUST TOTALLY CUT OFF
FROM REALITY?


557
00:25:44.254 --> 00:25:46.300
NO ONE CAN TELL ME
WHAT TO DO HERE...


558
00:25:46.343 --> 00:25:49.085
OR PULL ON ME.

559
00:25:49.129 --> 00:25:51.610
SOMEDAY I WANT TO SAIL SOLO
ACROSS THE PACIFIC.


560
00:25:52.872 --> 00:25:55.135
HEY, ALLIE, HOW ABOUT
MAKING SOME SANDWICHES?


561
00:25:55.178 --> 00:25:57.528
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

562
00:25:57.572 --> 00:25:59.618
Rick: WELL, WE ARE.
COME ON. HELP OUT A LITTLE.


563
00:25:59.661 --> 00:26:00.619
YOU DO IT.

564
00:26:00.662 --> 00:26:02.142
I'M ON WATCH.

565
00:26:02.185 --> 00:26:04.535
SO THAT MAKES ME THE COOK?

566
00:26:04.579 --> 00:26:06.363
I DON'T THINK SO, RICK.

567
00:26:06.407 --> 00:26:07.756
I'LL MAKE 'EM.

568
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.237
NO, NO.
ALLIE WILL DO IT.


569
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.499
FORGET IT.

570
00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:13.414
YOU'RE PART
OF THIS CREW.


571
00:26:13.457 --> 00:26:15.024
IT MEANS YOU WORK
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.


572
00:26:15.068 --> 00:26:17.766
SLEEPING WITH YOU
IS PLENTY OF WORK.


573
00:26:19.768 --> 00:26:21.509
YOU ALWAYS
PULL THIS CRAP.


574
00:26:24.817 --> 00:26:27.776
I SWEAR, ALLIE,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
RUIN THIS JOB, TOO.


575
00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:34.435
IT IS SO TYPICAL
OF RICK TO BLAME ME


576
00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:35.958
FOR GETTING FIRED
OFF HIS LAST BOAT.


577
00:26:36.002 --> 00:26:39.396
HE KNEW THE OWNER DIDN'T
ALLOW DRINKING ON BOARD.


578
00:26:41.137 --> 00:26:42.486
WHAT'S WITH YOU TWO?

579
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.053
YOU SEEM SO DIFFERENT,

580
00:26:44.097 --> 00:26:46.926
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHY YOU'RE TOGETHER.


581
00:26:46.969 --> 00:26:49.493
RICK HELPED ME
WHEN I SPLIT UP
WITH MY HUSBAND.


582
00:26:49.537 --> 00:26:51.713
IT GOT PRETTY UGLY.

583
00:26:51.757 --> 00:26:53.019
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE MARRIED.


584
00:26:53.062 --> 00:26:54.411
YEAH.

585
00:26:58.764 --> 00:27:01.723
RICK'S A SWEET GUY
WHO LOVES ME


586
00:27:01.767 --> 00:27:03.420
AND DOESN'T
EXPECT MUCH,


587
00:27:03.464 --> 00:27:05.205
AND THAT'S
JUST WHAT I NEED


588
00:27:05.248 --> 00:27:07.511
TILL I GET TO CANADA
TO START OVER.


589
00:27:07.555 --> 00:27:09.035
AND HE'S OK WITH THAT?

590
00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:13.082
EVERY RELATIONSHIP
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A LIFELONG COMMITMENT.


591
00:27:18.435 --> 00:27:20.437
LOOK. DOLPHINS.

592
00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:23.484
THOSE AREN'T DOLPHINS.

593
00:27:26.139 --> 00:27:27.357
THEY'RE SHARKS.

594
00:27:57.605 --> 00:27:59.825
MMM. MMM.

595
00:27:59.868 --> 00:28:01.565
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GETTING COFFEE.


596
00:28:01.609 --> 00:28:02.958
THAT'S
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.


597
00:28:03.002 --> 00:28:04.438
AND I THOUGHT
THIS WAS A DRY BOAT.


598
00:28:04.481 --> 00:28:06.179
IT'S JUST A LITTLE WHISKEY
I BROUGHT FOR COLD NIGHTS.


599
00:28:06.222 --> 00:28:07.310
IT WON'T HURT ANYTHING.

600
00:28:07.354 --> 00:28:10.357
I DON'T DRINK
WHEN I'M ON WATCH.


601
00:28:11.488 --> 00:28:14.491
OH, AND YOU'VE NEVER
DONE 60 IN A 55?


602
00:28:14.535 --> 00:28:15.623
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

603
00:28:18.104 --> 00:28:19.235
AHH.

604
00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:20.367
OK.

605
00:28:21.324 --> 00:28:22.586
YOU'RE RIGHT.

606
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:23.718
I'M SORRY.

607
00:28:25.285 --> 00:28:26.808
DON'T MENTION IT
TO RICK, OK?


608
00:28:29.855 --> 00:28:32.466
I GUESS I, UH...

609
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:33.946
I ALSO DRINK
SOMETIMES WHEN
I'M NERVOUS.


610
00:28:33.989 --> 00:28:35.861
IT TAKES
THE EDGE OFF.


611
00:28:35.904 --> 00:28:36.992
WHAT ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT?

612
00:28:40.256 --> 00:28:41.910
YOU.

613
00:28:41.954 --> 00:28:43.042
AND ME. US.

614
00:28:43.085 --> 00:28:45.435
US?

615
00:28:45.479 --> 00:28:47.873
YEAH, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.


616
00:28:47.916 --> 00:28:50.310
THE OTHER NIGHT
BEFORE WE LEFT
SAN DIEGO.


617
00:28:50.353 --> 00:28:52.486
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

618
00:28:52.529 --> 00:28:53.879
LOOK, MATT...

619
00:28:53.922 --> 00:28:55.358
I LIKE YOU A LOT,

620
00:28:55.402 --> 00:28:57.056
BUT I JUST CAN'T...

621
00:28:58.579 --> 00:28:59.841
IT'S JASON, ISN'T IT?

622
00:28:59.885 --> 00:29:01.669
THERE'S A STORY THERE.
I KNOW IT.


623
00:29:01.712 --> 00:29:03.976
WHAT? NO. I WAS
GONNA SAY I'M WARY


624
00:29:04.019 --> 00:29:05.716
ABOUT GETTING INVOLVED
WITH SOMEONE I'M SAILING WITH.


625
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.936
HMM. DIDN'T SEEM TO BE
A PROBLEM WITH HIM.


626
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.592
A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF WHY I'M WARY.


627
00:29:17.467 --> 00:29:20.862
HEY. I'M SORRY.

IS JASON ALL RIGHT?

955
00:46:22.927 --> 00:46:24.319
YEAH. HE'S FINE.

956
00:46:24.363 --> 00:46:26.887
LOOKS LIKE IT HURTS.

957
00:46:26.931 --> 00:46:27.888
UHH...

958
00:46:27.932 --> 00:46:29.890
ONLY WHEN THE BOAT MOVES.

959
00:46:31.936 --> 00:46:34.764
HERE. THIS SHOULD
CUSHION THE BUMPS.


960
00:46:34.808 --> 00:46:37.463
THANKS.

961
00:46:37.506 --> 00:46:40.422
SO HOW ARE YOU GUYS
DOING UP THERE?


962
00:46:40.466 --> 00:46:41.467
IT'S TOUGH,

963
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:44.078
BUT WE'RE
HANGING IN THERE.


964
00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:47.255
IT'S BAD, ISN'T IT?

965
00:46:47.299 --> 00:46:50.563
"SEA-BROOK"
CAN HANDLE IT.


966
00:46:52.086 --> 00:46:53.566
YEAH, BUT CAN RICK?

967
00:46:58.963 --> 00:47:01.748
I GUESS I REALLY
DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF CAPTAIN HE IS.


968
00:47:01.791 --> 00:47:03.837
HE'S DOING FINE.
DON'T WORRY.


969
00:47:17.416 --> 00:47:21.986
ALL THIS POUNDING,
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE
JUST FALLING APART.


970
00:47:22.029 --> 00:47:23.509
I'M GONNA
GO BACK UP, OK?


971
00:47:34.476 --> 00:47:38.306
"SEA-BROOK," "SEA-BROOK,"
REQUEST TO KNOW
YOUR SITUATION. OVER.


972
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:39.655
UH, ROGER, COAST GUARD.

00:47:39.699 --> 00:47:41.048
THIS IS "SEA

974
00:47:41.092 --> 00:47:44.225
UM... MY RADAR SHOWS
THE STORM MOVING WEST.


975
00:47:44.269 --> 00:47:47.228
I THINK
WE'RE GONNA BE OK.


976
00:47:47.272 --> 00:47:48.882
SEAS ARE
PRETTY ROUGH OUT HERE,


977
00:47:48.926 --> 00:47:50.318
BUT I THINK WE'RE
GONNA MAKE IT.


978
00:47:50.362 --> 00:47:52.277
WE'RE HEADING INTO
SAN SIMEON. OVER.


979

981
00:47:54.714 --> 00:47:55.802

984
00:48:00.024 --> 00:48:02.069
COME ON, BABY.

985
00:48:06.682 --> 00:48:09.772
OH... SHEE...

986
00:48:09.816 --> 00:48:11.731
MAN, THE OWNER'S
GONNA HAVE RICK'S HIDE.


987
00:48:11.774 --> 00:48:14.081
WELL, AT LEAST SHE'S
STILL FLOATING.


988
00:48:14.125 --> 00:48:16.823
JASON...

989
00:48:16.866 --> 00:48:18.433
I WAS SO SCARED
WHEN...


990
00:48:18.477 --> 00:48:21.262
I KNOW.

991
00:48:21.306 --> 00:48:22.394
THANK YOU.

992
00:48:22.437 --> 00:48:23.656
[BEEEEEP]

00:48:23.699 --> 00:48:25.571
NO. NO, NOT AGAIN!

994
00:48:25.614 --> 00:48:27.007
OH, MAN.

995
00:48:27.051 --> 00:48:30.097
CHECK THE ENGINE, RICK.
CHECK THE ENGINE!


996
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.883
WE NEED MORE SAIL.

997
00:48:33.927 --> 00:48:35.842
OK. I'LL GO LET HER OUT.
CAN YOU HOLD HER?


998
00:48:35.885 --> 00:48:36.974
YUP.

999
00:48:42.892 --> 00:48:44.459
CAREFUL, SUSAN.

1000
00:48:51.075 --> 00:48:52.293
EASE HER OUT SLOW.

1001
00:48:52.337 --> 00:48:53.164
I'M TRYING.

1002
00:48:56.471 --> 00:48:57.690
SLOWLY...

1003
00:48:57.733 --> 00:48:59.126
I CAN'T CLEAR IT.

1004
00:49:10.572 --> 00:49:12.444
AAH!

1005
00:49:12.487 --> 00:49:14.402
JASON! HELP ME!

1006
00:49:14.446 --> 00:49:15.534

1010
00:49:23.629 --> 00:49:25.500
PICK YOUR FEET UP.

1011
00:49:25.544 --> 00:49:26.719
I CAN'T.

1012
00:49:26.762 --> 00:49:29.026
YOU CAN. COME ON.

1013
00:49:29.069 --> 00:49:31.158
COME ON,

1014
00:49:31.202 --> 00:49:33.204
I GOT YOU.

1015
00:49:33.247 --> 00:49:35.467
GET UP. OK.

1016
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:36.598

1017
00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.298
I'M OK.

1018
00:49:40.341 --> 00:49:42.126
I'LL FINISH
LOADING UP THE MAIN.


1019
00:49:42.169 --> 00:49:44.780
NO, NO. NO, FORGET IT.
THE STORM'S TOO BIG.


1020
00:49:44.824 --> 00:49:49.089
IF WE CAN'T FIX THE ENGINE,
WE GOTTA CALL FOR HELP.


1021
00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:02.059
YOU ALL RIGHT?

RICK, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?


1026
00:50:15.768 --> 00:50:18.901
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE FIXING THE
ENGINE, REMEMBER?


1027
00:50:18.945 --> 00:50:20.642
COULD YOU FIX
THE MAINSAIL?


1028
00:50:20.686 --> 00:50:22.122
I COULDN'T FREE IT.

1029
00:50:24.298 --> 00:50:26.257
THAT SEALS IT.
WE'RE DONE FOR.


1030
00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.128
RICK, WHAT ABOUT
THE ENGINE?


1031
00:50:28.172 --> 00:50:31.262
FORGET IT.
WE'RE SCREWED.


1032
00:50:31.305 --> 00:50:33.612
RICK, GET OFF YOUR ASS
AND START ACTING
LIKE A CAPTAIN.


1033
00:50:33.655 --> 00:50:36.397
RADIO THE COAST GUARD
FOR HELP.


1034
00:50:36.441 --> 00:50:38.138
THE STORM,
I THINK IT'S
MOVING WEST.


1035
00:50:38.182 --> 00:50:39.922
THE HELL IT IS.
WE'RE RIGHT IN
THE MIDDLE OF IT.


1036
00:50:39.966 --> 00:50:43.012
IF I CALL
THE COAST GUARD...


1037
00:50:43.056 --> 00:50:44.797
I'LL NEVER WORK
AGAIN.


1038
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.233
WHAT?

1039
00:50:46.277 --> 00:50:48.366
YOU'RE SITTING HERE
THINKING ABOUT
YOUR CAREER?


1040
00:50:48.409 --> 00:50:50.716
RICK, WE'RE IN TROUBLE,
BIG TROUBLE.


1041
00:50:50.759 --> 00:50:52.021
WE'VE GOT TO CALL
THE COAST GUARD


1042
00:50:52.065 --> 00:50:54.807
AND PRAY WE CAN HOLD ON
TILL THEY GET HERE.


1043
00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.200
WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF THE VESSEL, MA'AM?


1044
00:50:56.243 --> 00:50:57.157
THE "SEA
-BROOK."

1045
00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:58.376
IT'S SAILING
UP TO VANCOUVER.


1046
00:50:58.419 --> 00:51:00.117
I'M AFRAID
IT MAY BE CAUGHT
IN THIS STORM.


1047
00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.510
UH, MA'AM, WE ARE
VERY BUSY RIGHT NOW.


1048
00:51:02.554 --> 00:51:04.164
BUT I'LL SEE IF I CAN
RAISE THEM ON THE RADIO.


1049
00:51:04.208 --> 00:51:05.818
CALL US BACK

1050
00:51:05.861 --> 00:51:07.559
PLEASE. IT'S...
IT'S MY DAUGHTER.


1051
00:51:07.602 --> 00:51:09.952
WE'RE GONNA

1052
00:51:16.524 --> 00:51:19.092
LIEUTENANT,
I JUST SAW A REPORT
ON THE "SEA-BROOK."


1053

1054
00:51:20.659 --> 00:51:22.574
AND SAID THEY WERE
SAFELY EN ROUTE
TO SAN SIMEON.


1055
00:51:22.617 --> 00:51:23.966

00:54:41.512 --> 00:54:43.427
OVER HERE!

1103
00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.865
OVER HERE, MATT!

1104
00:54:46.908 --> 00:54:50.390
RICK! OHH...

1105
00:54:50.434 --> 00:54:51.783
YOU OK, BABY?

1106
00:54:51.826 --> 00:54:53.350
MY LEGS HURT.

1107
00:54:53.393 --> 00:54:54.438
HOLD ON!

1108
00:55:00.139 --> 00:55:01.445
WHERE'S JASON?

1109
00:55:01.488 --> 00:55:02.750
I DON'T KNOW.

1110
00:55:02.794 --> 00:55:04.099
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OTHER RAFT?


1111
00:55:04.143 --> 00:55:05.797
I COULDN'T
HOLD ON TO IT.


1112
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.102
JASON!

1113
00:55:07.146 --> 00:55:08.408
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU COULDN'T HOLD
ON TO IT?


1114
00:55:08.452 --> 00:55:10.845
THAT HAD ALL OUR
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES.


1115
00:55:10.889 --> 00:55:12.499
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
A STORM HERE, REMEMBER?


1116
00:55:12.543 --> 00:55:13.979
WE'RE DEAD
WITHOUT THAT STUFF.


1117
00:55:14.022 --> 00:55:15.241
STOP IT!

1118
00:55:15.284 --> 00:55:17.635
IT'S OVER!
IT'S ALL OVER!


1119
00:55:17.678 --> 00:55:19.376
SHUT UP, RICK!
SHUT UP!


1120
00:55:19.419 --> 00:55:20.725
JASON!

1121
00:55:20.768 --> 00:55:21.900
I CAN'T HOLD ON.

1122
00:55:21.943 --> 00:55:24.337
HOLD ON, BABY.
JUST HOLD ON.


1123
00:55:24.381 --> 00:55:26.861
LET'S FLIP THE ZODIAC
AND GET IN.


1124
00:55:26.905 --> 00:55:30.038
OK. WE'LL
TAKE THE BACK.
YOU TAKE THE BOW.


1125
00:55:30.082 --> 00:55:32.563
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.


1126
00:55:34.913 --> 00:55:36.349
OK, YOU READY?

1127
00:55:36.393 --> 00:55:38.438
HOLD ON, BABY.
HOLD ON.


1128
00:55:38.482 --> 00:55:41.746
1... 2...

1129
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:42.877
3!

1130
00:55:44.531 --> 00:55:46.751
[SCREAMING]

1131
00:55:52.496 --> 00:55:54.454
COME ON, BABY, SWIM!

1132
00:55:54.498 --> 00:55:55.455
I CAN'T...

1133
00:55:55.499 --> 00:55:56.804
YOU CAN DO IT!

1134
00:56:10.296 --> 00:56:11.645
JASON, THANK GOD!

1135
00:56:11.689 --> 00:56:13.386
I GOT CAUGHT.

1136
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:15.170
I GOT
DRAGGED UNDER.


1137
00:56:15.214 --> 00:56:18.609
OK, WE GOT TO
FLIP THIS AND GET IN.


1138
00:56:18.652 --> 00:56:20.611
IT'LL BLOW AWAY AGAIN!

1139
00:56:20.654 --> 00:56:22.395
WE'LL GRAB THE LINE
OVER THE LEEWARD SIDE


1140
00:56:22.439 --> 00:56:24.353
AND LET THE WIND
TURN IT OVER.


1141
00:56:24.397 --> 00:56:25.485
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO IT.


1142
00:56:25.529 --> 00:56:29.228
GO! GO!
OUT OF THE WAY!


1143
00:56:29.271 --> 00:56:32.579
GO TO THE
OTHER SIDE, ALLIE!


1144
00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.805
GET READY TO PULL!

1145
00:56:40.848 --> 00:56:44.199
OK. I'M READY.
GO AHEAD.


1146
00:56:44.243 --> 00:56:46.114
ALL RIGHT... AAH!

1147
00:56:53.165 --> 00:56:54.645
GIVE ME YOUR HAND!

1148
00:56:54.688 --> 00:56:56.124
HERE!

1149
00:56:56.168 --> 00:56:57.343
GIVE ME IT!

1150
00:57:12.706 --> 00:57:15.143
OH, MY GOD...
YOUR LEGS.


1151
00:57:15.187 --> 00:57:16.841
IT WAS THE RIGGING.

1152
00:57:16.884 --> 00:57:19.278
THIS WIND
IS SO COLD.


1153
00:57:19.321 --> 00:57:20.888
IT'S KILLING ME.

1154
00:57:20.932 --> 00:57:23.151
I'M TELLING YOU,
WE'RE BETTER OFF
IN THE WATER.


1155
00:57:23.195 --> 00:57:24.544
HE'S RIGHT.
WE SHOULD
GET BACK IN.


1156
00:57:24.588 --> 00:57:25.893
NO!

1157
00:57:25.937 --> 00:57:27.460
I CAN'T.

1158
00:57:27.504 --> 00:57:29.984
MAYBE IF WE BUNCH UP...
CONSERVE BODY HEAT.


1159
00:57:30.028 --> 00:57:31.943
Rick: IT'S TOO
COLD OUT HERE.


1160
00:57:31.986 --> 00:57:33.727
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
GET BACK IN.


1161
00:57:33.771 --> 00:57:34.728
OK. WE WON'T.

1162
00:57:34.772 --> 00:57:36.121
LET'S JUST STAY CLOSE.

1163
00:57:39.298 --> 00:57:40.560
IT'S OVER.

1164
00:57:40.604 --> 00:57:42.040
I JUST
KNOW IT'S OVER.


1165
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:43.171
OH, SHUT UP!

1166
00:57:43.215 --> 00:57:44.956
COME ON, GUYS, WE
HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.


1167
00:57:44.999 --> 00:57:47.262
IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE
UNTIL WE GET RESCUED.


1168
00:57:47.306 --> 00:57:50.222
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE
HEARD YOUR MAYDAY.


1169
00:57:50.265 --> 00:57:51.832
THEY'RE NOT COMING.

1170
00:57:51.876 --> 00:57:52.833
STOP SAYING THAT!

1171
00:57:52.877 --> 00:57:54.356
NO, I MEAN,
THEY'RE NOT COMING.


1172
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.141
I TOLD THEM
NOT TO COME.


1173
00:57:56.184 --> 00:57:57.708
WHAT?
WHAT?


1174
00:57:57.751 --> 00:58:00.537
I SAW YOU TALKING...
I MEAN, BEFORE THE
BOAT WENT DOWN.


1175
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.626
I TRIED. IT WAS
WATERLOGGED BY THEN.


1176
00:58:02.669 --> 00:58:04.062
DAMN!

1177
00:58:04.105 --> 00:58:06.194
WE ARE GONNA DIE.

1178
00:58:06.238 --> 00:58:08.806
NO. WE'RE GONNA SURVIVE.

1179
00:58:08.849 --> 00:58:10.416
IN THE MORNING THEY'LL
BE LOOKING FOR US.


1180
00:58:10.459 --> 00:58:11.765
WE CAN CERTAINLY
HOLD OUT TILL THEN.


1181
00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:13.419
THERE ARE SHARKS
ALL THROUGH THESE WATERS.


1182
00:58:13.462 --> 00:58:14.507
THERE'S GREAT WHITES.

1183
00:58:14.551 --> 00:58:17.336
BUT WE SHOULD BE
SAFE IN HERE.


1184
00:58:22.863 --> 00:58:24.604
THIS IS MY FAULT.

1185
00:58:26.867 --> 00:58:28.652
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

1186
00:58:45.451 --> 00:58:47.453
Susan: WHEN DAY
FINALLY BROKE,


1187
00:58:47.496 --> 00:58:49.629
WHAT I SAW SCARED ME.

1188
00:58:49.673 --> 00:58:51.979
OF COURSE, OUR BOAT
WAS LONG GONE...


1189
00:58:52.023 --> 00:58:55.504
RESTING QUIETLY
ON THE BOTTOM OF
THE PACIFIC OCEAN.


1190
00:58:55.548 --> 00:58:57.419
PLUS WE HAD NO SUPPLIES...

1191
00:58:57.463 --> 00:59:00.814
NO FOOD, NO WATER,
AND NO CAPTAIN.


1192
00:59:00.858 --> 00:59:03.382
AS RICK HAD LOST ALL HOPE,

1193
00:59:03.425 --> 00:59:06.777
HE HAD NOTHING TO OFFER
IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP.


1194
00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:09.954
ALLIE WAS IN TERRIBLE PAIN,
TRYING HARD TO BE RONG,


1195
00:59:09.997 --> 00:59:12.521
AND MATT WAS EDGY
AND QUICK-TEMPERED.


1196
00:59:12.565 --> 00:59:16.569
IT WAS UP TO ME AND JASON
TO KEEP EVERYONE'S
SPIRITS UP.


1197
00:59:16.613 --> 00:59:17.788
I WAS SCARED AS HELL.

1198
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:18.832
WE NEED A COVER.

1199
00:59:18.876 --> 00:59:20.660
JASON...

1200
00:59:20.704 --> 00:59:23.489
DO WE HAVE ANYTHING
TO MAKE A CANOPY?


1201
00:59:23.532 --> 00:59:24.621
UM...

1202
00:59:28.233 --> 00:59:29.713
YEAH. UM...

1203
00:59:39.548 --> 00:59:40.767
THIS WILL WORK.

1204
00:59:40.811 --> 00:59:42.377
LET'S SET IT UP,

1205
00:59:42.421 --> 00:59:44.031
AND THEN WE CAN TAKE
TURNS KEEPING WATCH


1206
00:59:44.075 --> 00:59:45.598
UNTIL A SHIP COMES.

1207
00:59:48.906 --> 00:59:49.863
HEY...

1208
00:59:49.907 --> 00:59:50.951
GET UP, GUYS.

1209
00:59:50.995 --> 00:59:51.996
HELP US OU

1210
00:59:52.039 --> 00:59:53.519
WE'RE GONNA MAKE A CANOPY.

1211
01:01:05.547 --> 01:01:06.853
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1212
01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:10.030
STOP. DON'T DRINK THAT.
IT'LL MAKE YOU CRAZY.


1213
01:01:10.074 --> 01:01:12.076
A SMALL AMOUNT
WON'T HURT.


1214
01:01:12.119 --> 01:01:14.121
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
DRINKING YOUR
OWN URINE.


1215
01:01:14.165 --> 01:01:17.690
YOU DRINK WHAT YOU WANT,
I'LL DRINK WHAT I WANT.


1216
01:01:17.734 --> 01:01:20.475
HERE YOU GO, BABY.
HAVE A LITTLE WATER.


1217
01:01:20.519 --> 01:01:21.433
NO!

1218
01:01:21.476 --> 01:01:22.651
DAMN IT!
YOU LITTLE...


1219
01:01:22.695 --> 01:01:23.914
AAH!

1220
01:01:23.957 --> 01:01:24.915
STAY AWAY!

1221
01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.481
AAH! GET OFF!

1222
01:01:26.525 --> 01:01:28.266
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?!


1223
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:30.137
OH, MAN!

1224
01:01:32.749 --> 01:01:34.402
IT'S OK.

1225
01:01:34.446 --> 01:01:36.840
IT'S OK.
I'M FINE.


1226
01:01:36.883 --> 01:01:39.799
IT'S JUST MY LEG
HURTS SO BAD. [SOBS]


1227
01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:42.628
IT'S OK.

1228
01:01:45.152 --> 01:01:45.979
IT'S OK, BABY.

1229
01:01:51.506 --> 01:01:53.639
OH...

1230
01:01:53.682 --> 01:01:57.861
OH...
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO
MY BEAUTIFUL BABY?


1231
01:01:57.904 --> 01:01:59.384
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

1232
01:02:02.082 --> 01:02:03.780
I'VE RUINED
EVERYTHING.


1233
01:02:11.918 --> 01:02:13.920
AT LEAST THE STORM PASSED.

1234
01:02:20.274 --> 01:02:22.581
HERE COMES THE SUN.

1235
01:03:11.108 --> 01:03:13.980
I DON'T THINK I CAN STAND
ANOTHER NIGHT HERE.


1236
01:03:15.939 --> 01:03:18.245
THIS IS THE LAST
ONE, ALLIE.


1237
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:20.900
WE'LL BE RESCUED
TOMORROW.


1238
01:03:20.944 --> 01:03:22.032
REALLY?

1239
01:03:22.075 --> 01:03:24.295
MM
-HMM.

1240
01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:28.038
RICK, DO YOU THINK SO?

1241
01:03:28.081 --> 01:03:31.476
WE DON'T NEED
TO BE RESCUED.


1242
01:03:31.519 --> 01:03:32.433
I SEE SHORE.

1243
01:03:32.477 --> 01:03:34.740
WHERE?

1244
01:03:34.783 --> 01:03:36.046
Rick:
OVER THERE.


1245
01:03:39.788 --> 01:03:41.355
WE'RE OFF
MISSION BAY.


1246
01:03:41.399 --> 01:03:43.053
WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR
MISSION BAY.


1247
01:03:43.096 --> 01:03:45.011
YES, WE ARE.
I RECOGNIZE
THE BUILDINGS.


1248
01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:46.752
ARE... ARE YOU SURE?

1249
01:03:46.795 --> 01:03:48.319
RICK, YOU'RE
SEEING THINGS.


1250
01:03:48.362 --> 01:03:51.104
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING
TOO MUCH SEA WATER.
YOU'RE CONFUSED.


1251
01:03:51.148 --> 01:03:52.540
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S THERE.


1252
01:03:52.584 --> 01:03:54.716
COME ON, BUDDY,
SIT DOWN.


1253
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.109
SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.


1254
01:03:56.153 --> 01:03:59.547
Allie: RICK...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?


1255
01:03:59.591 --> 01:04:01.506
RICK, NO!
RICK!


1256
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:02.507
RICK, NO!

1257
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:04.857
COME BACK!

1258
01:04:04.901 --> 01:04:06.641
RICK, PLEASE,
DON'T LEAVE ME!


1259

01:25:12.906 --> 01:25:14.081
OH, THANK GOD!

1563
01:25:14.125 --> 01:25:16.693
THEY STILL HAVE
TO GET THEM BOTH
ON BOARD.


1564
01:25:16.736 --> 01:25:18.477
BOTH? A MAN?
A WOMAN? WHO?


1565
01:25:18.521 --> 01:25:20.087
I DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE.


1566
01:25:20.131 --> 01:25:21.132
THEY'RE
ON BOARD.


1567
01:25:21.176 --> 01:25:22.699
WHO?

1568
01:25:22.742 --> 01:25:24.614
YOUNG MAN... AND
A YOUNG WOMAN.


1569
01:25:26.355 --> 01:25:29.314
JASON O'DONNELL...
AND SUSAN CLARKSON.


1570
01:25:29.358 --> 01:25:30.446
HA HA HA!

1571
01:25:30.489 --> 01:25:32.230
THANK YOU!
OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU!


1572
01:25:32.274 --> 01:25:33.797
THANK YOU
SO MUCH!


1573
01:26:33.944 --> 01:26:36.033
[CAR APPROACHING]

1574
01:26:37.774 --> 01:26:38.601
AH!

1575
01:26:41.778 --> 01:26:42.605
OH...

1576
01:26:52.223 --> 01:26:54.007
Susan:
IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER


1577
01:26:54.051 --> 01:26:56.009
THAT I REALIZED
WHAT MY MOM DID.


1578
01:26:56.053 --> 01:26:57.576
SUSANNAH.

1579
01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:01.145
SHE REFUSED TO GIVE UP,
AND SHE HELPED SAVE
OUR LIVES.


1580
01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:05.541
I GUESS, IN A WAY,
JASON AND MY MOM


1581
01:27:05.584 --> 01:27:08.674
WERE BOTH
TRYING TO TEACH ME
THE SAME THING...


1582
01:27:08.718 --> 01:27:12.330
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH NEEDING PEOPLE.


1583
01:27:12.374 --> 01:27:16.769
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US STRONG,
THAT'S WHAT MAKES US HUMAN,


1584
01:27:16.813 --> 01:27:18.771
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M ALIVE TODAY.
