20
00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:42.306
Carlos!

21
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.175
Carlos,
we're waiting dinner on you.


22
00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.676
- I'm not hungry.
- You are 30 minutes late!


23
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.979
You shouldn't have
taken my phone!


24
00:02:01.993 --> 00:02:03.828
I'm busy.

25
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:06.030
Hey, put on a shirt
and come downstairs.


26
00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:07.164
I said, "I'm not hungry."

27
00:02:07.198 --> 00:02:08.732
Well, that's fine, don't eat.

28
00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:09.699
You still gotta come downstairs.

29
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.601
We gotta sign you up
for those online classes


30
00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:12.803
before tomorrow.

31
00:02:12.837 --> 00:02:14.471
I don't wanna
take online classes.


32
00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:16.774
Well, this is the consequence
of cuttin' classes


33
00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:18.541
- at your last school.
- Great.


34
00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:19.977
No, it's not great.

35
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:21.913
Now you can either sign up
for those online classes


36
00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:23.580
or go to military school.

37
00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:24.748
You can't make me do that.

38
00:02:24.782 --> 00:02:25.749
Oh, yes, I can.

39
00:02:25.783 --> 00:02:29.486
You are 16 years old,
you're still a child.


40
00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.654
I'm not a child.

41
00:02:30.687 --> 00:02:31.956
Then quit actin' like one.

42
00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:37.061
Now put on a shirt
and come downstairs.


43
00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:38.461
Yes, sir, colonel!

44
00:02:39.897 --> 00:02:41.765
Oh.

45
00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.667
He's not hungry.

46
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.435
I worry
that he's not eating enough.


47
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.172
That's what worries you?

48
00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:55.146
Carlos!

49
00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:56.213
Yeah, I gotta run.

50
00:02:56.247 --> 00:02:56.981
Carlos.

51
00:02:57.014 --> 00:02:58.648
We can talk about school
tomorrow.


52
00:03:43.094 --> 00:03:44.728
Nice fit, Carlos.

53
00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:47.031
Your mom order those shoes
in prison?


54
00:03:47.064 --> 00:03:48.799
- She's not in prison.
- Right.


55
00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:50.835
White criminals get resorts.

56
00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:52.069
She's in rehab.

57
00:03:52.103 --> 00:03:53.603
Whatever.

58
00:03:53.636 --> 00:03:54.872
Here, take some of these.

59
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.607
Oh, sick.

60
00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:03.214
Oh.

61
00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:07.218
Uh, better than basketball.

62
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:09.253
Eh, no ball tonight.

63
00:04:09.286 --> 00:04:11.822
- Some dance show.
- What?


64
00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:13.723
Yeah,
some Christmas in August party.


65
00:04:13.757 --> 00:04:14.691
I don't know.

66
00:04:14.724 --> 00:04:15.793
We just gotta sit through
some random dance,


67
00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:18.829
and then we can get
some free shoes, free backpacks,


68
00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:20.031
iPads, all of that.

69
00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:21.598
- You serious?
- Mmhmm.


70
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:23.834
Here, have another one.

71
00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:25.803
Whoa, I'd slow down.

72
00:04:25.836 --> 00:04:26.971
It's gonna be a long night.

73
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:28.939
Here, take one of these,
for your breath.


74
00:04:30.808 --> 00:04:32.810
Thanks.

75
00:04:32.843 --> 00:04:33.911
Oh.

76
00:04:36.047 --> 00:04:38.249
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.


77
00:04:47.657 --> 00:04:48.993
Merry Christmas, boys.

78
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.796
Let's see in that bag.

79
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.370
Your breath
sure smell minty fresh.


80
00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:01.704
We like to keep it fresh
for the ladies.


81
00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:05.876
Too fresh I bet.

82
00:05:06.977 --> 00:05:08.913
These ladies would rather
you focus on graduating


83
00:05:08.946 --> 00:05:11.015
from high school.

84
00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:12.749
All right, here you go.

85
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:16.053
I'm glad you boys are here.

86
00:05:16.087 --> 00:05:17.654
It's gonna be a special night.

87
00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.200
You don't want
it, you don't want it!


88
00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:30.801
You don't want it.

89
00:05:30.835 --> 00:05:31.734
Ball is life.

90
00:05:31.768 --> 00:05:32.735
- Oh!
- Oh!


91
00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:57.161
Nice shot.

92
00:05:57.194 --> 00:05:58.863
Hey guys, let's go, let's go,
let's go!


93
00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:00.397
Show's about to start,
come to the gym.


94
00:07:39.096 --> 00:07:41.098
Thank you, thank you.

95
00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:42.765
Thank you for comin' out
tonight.


96
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.201
Uh, we're creatin'
a brand-new version


97
00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:45.269
of the Nutcracker,

98
00:07:45.302 --> 00:07:48.305

of different dances.


99
00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:49.473
If you wanna join us,

100
00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:51.141
these guys
from RACE Dance Company


101
00:07:51.175 --> 00:07:53.010
will be teachin'
free hip hop classes


102
00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:54.845
right here
in the rec center.


103
00:07:54.878 --> 00:07:56.380
You can sign up on your way out.

104
00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:57.815
Thank you very much.

105
00:08:10.027 --> 00:08:11.295
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

106
00:08:11.328 --> 00:08:12.963
Y'all, break it up!
What y'all doin'?


107
00:08:12.997 --> 00:08:13.864
Mind your own business.

108
00:08:13.897 --> 00:08:15.899
No, eh, no,
this place is my business.


109
00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:17.201
It's ours, too.

110
00:08:17.234 --> 00:08:18.469
Man, not when you're
a drunk mess, man.


111
00:08:18.502 --> 00:08:19.970
I can smell your breath
from here!


112
00:08:20.004 --> 00:08:21.505
Hey, come on.
Hold on, hold on.


113
00:08:23.073 --> 00:08:24.008
Back up.

114
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:27.177
Oh!

115
00:08:34.118 --> 00:08:36.854
Carlos, put it down!

116
00:08:36.887 --> 00:08:38.822
Put it down or go to jail.

117
00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:04.548
It's all about choices, Carlos.

118
00:09:04.581 --> 00:09:07.284
Your bad ones started
when you decided to drink.


119
00:09:07.318 --> 00:09:09.620
But you made a good one
back there at the end.


120
00:09:09.653 --> 00:09:11.288
Why do you care?

121
00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:13.290
It's my job to care
about good kids like you,


122
00:09:13.324 --> 00:09:16.593
so that you don't go to jail
for makin' bad decisions.


123
00:09:16.627 --> 00:09:19.396
I'm here to de-escalate,
not incarcerate.


124
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.864
What makes you think
I'm a good kid?


125
00:09:22.032 --> 00:09:23.334
You dropped the sword.

126
00:09:27.338 --> 00:09:30.407
Here, take my card.

127
00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:31.942
You and I
will be keepin' in touch.


128
00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:32.976
Whatever.

129
00:09:37.114 --> 00:09:38.482
Drink some water.

130
00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:31.635
What... what's going on?

131
00:10:31.668 --> 00:10:34.171
Carlos, <i>escúchame</i>! Carlos!

132
00:10:34.204 --> 00:10:36.540
You don't come to class,
you miss your assignments,


133
00:10:36.573 --> 00:10:38.509
you don't focus,
you don't listen.


134
00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:39.510
Carlos!

135
00:11:19.016 --> 00:11:20.717
Carlos, what are you doing?

136
00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:22.052
- <i>Carlos.</i>
- <i>Carlos.</i>


137
00:11:22.085 --> 00:11:22.619
<i>Carlos.</i>

138
00:11:23.788 --> 00:11:26.290
- Carlos.
- Mom?


139
00:11:26.323 --> 00:11:28.091
- Carlos.
- M... mom!


140
00:11:40.437 --> 00:11:41.505
Oh!

141
00:11:54.418 --> 00:11:55.652
What's going on?

142
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:58.388
Carlos, your grandparents...

143
00:11:58.422 --> 00:12:00.624
I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to my grandparents.


144
00:12:00.657 --> 00:12:02.593
Well, that's a surprise.

145
00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:04.127
You haven't communicated with us

146
00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:06.196
since I invited you
into this house.


147
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.431
- Invited?
- Yes.


148
00:12:07.464 --> 00:12:10.534
When your mom got sent away,
we invited you into our home,


149
00:12:10.567 --> 00:12:13.470
but you have treat us
with complete disrespect.


150
00:12:13.504 --> 00:12:15.506
Carlos, we love you.

151
00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:17.341
- We're trying to...
- It's not working.


152
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.744
You're kicking me out?

153
00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:22.279
Are you serious?

154
00:12:22.312 --> 00:12:24.248
We're only here to talk
about options.


155
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:26.683
No, I don't have to put up
with this!


156
00:12:26.717 --> 00:12:29.186
You walk out of this room,
you'll be in military school


157
00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:31.121
for the next two years
of your life.


158
00:12:33.357 --> 00:12:35.259
Would you like to hear
about your other option?


159
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.600
Carlos, I'd like to introduce
you to your father


160
00:12:43.634 --> 00:12:45.102
Dross Meyer.

161
00:12:49.206 --> 00:12:50.307
Hey.

162
00:12:51.876 --> 00:12:53.477
It's great to finally meet you.

163
00:12:55.178 --> 00:12:57.247
It took your mom
getting arrested


164
00:12:57.281 --> 00:13:00.517
for your grandparents
to finally reach out to me.


165
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:02.787
But I'm glad they did.

166
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.222
I moved my work here,
so I could be closer to you.


167
00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:08.358
I want you to come stay with me.

168
00:13:10.494 --> 00:13:12.162
You guys never even talked
about this guy


169
00:13:12.195 --> 00:13:13.163
and now you want me
to live with him?


170
00:13:13.196 --> 00:13:15.867
They didn't come
up with this today.


171
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.869
Your family's been talking
about a way


172
00:13:17.902 --> 00:13:20.137
to best support you now
for months.


173
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.839
The guy that walked out on me
and my mom,


174
00:13:21.873 --> 00:13:24.474
your daughter,
that's my best option?


175
00:13:24.508 --> 00:13:26.577
I may not be your best option,

176
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.113
but aside from military school,
I am your only option.

181
00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.176
You wanna plug in and share?

182
00:13:59.209 --> 00:14:00.444
You wouldn't like it.

183

184
00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:02.713
Try me.

185
00:14:02.746 --> 00:14:05.616
It's not stupid ballet music.

186
00:14:05.649 --> 00:14:07.651
I told you last night,
I'm not makin' a ballet.


187
00:14:08.853 --> 00:14:10.687
I'm creating a new version
of the Nutcracker


188
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:13.557
that empowers different cultures
to tell their own stories.


189
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.758
I don't care.

190
00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:16.360

you like havin' that phone back.

I like the rhymin' style.

198
00:14:29.974 --> 00:14:32.643
The rhythm, sorta like
iambic pentameter,


199
00:14:32.676 --> 00:14:33.710
like Shakespeare.

200
00:14:33.744 --> 00:14:36.279
It's rap.

201
00:14:36.313 --> 00:14:39.349
Why can't I have a fake dad
who is into like the <i>Star Wars</i>?


202
00:14:39.383 --> 00:14:41.251
Hey,
the Nutcracker is like <i>Star Wars</i>.


203
00:14:41.819 --> 00:14:43.320
It is!

204
00:14:43.353 --> 00:14:47.491
- Hero, journey, fantasy, dance.
- Dance?


205
00:14:47.524 --> 00:14:49.861
Watch the lightsabers again
with dance in mind.


206
00:14:49.894 --> 00:14:51.695
Especially, all those capes.

207
00:14:52.797 --> 00:14:55.399

Hey, hey,
I am nothin' like your Grandpa.


211
00:15:00.737 --> 00:15:02.940
No, you're exactly like Grandpa.

212
00:15:02.974 --> 00:15:05.709
You didn't give a crap about me
till mom got locked up.


213
00:15:05.742 --> 00:15:07.711
Your grandparents stepped up
when they didn't have to.


214
00:15:07.744 --> 00:15:09.413
So now you're defending them?

215
00:15:09.446 --> 00:15:10.882
Hey, they kicked your ass out,
too!


216
00:15:10.915 --> 00:15:13.350
I'm not defending anybody!

217

Just sayin' there's more to it
than you know.


218
00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:17.922

you try talking to me

Hey Dross,
I got a surprise for you.


229
00:15:42.947 --> 00:15:43.815
- What?
- Check this out.


230
00:15:43.848 --> 00:15:45.215
Alright, man, let's go.

231
00:15:49.352 --> 00:15:51.588
What?

232
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:53.323
Yo, this is nice!

233
00:15:53.356 --> 00:15:54.357
Come on.

234
00:15:56.393 --> 00:15:59.296
Oh. Hey Carlos, get...
what do you need? Chairs?


235
00:15:59.329 --> 00:16:01.298
Yeah, like four chairs, table.

236
00:16:01.331 --> 00:16:02.499
Yeah, get four chairs
and a table,


237
00:16:02.532 --> 00:16:03.901
and set 'em up here stage right.

238
00:16:07.038 --> 00:16:09.841
This right here though,
y'all set this up?


239
00:16:09.874 --> 00:16:11.341
Oh, this is nice.

240
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.555
What's takin' so long?

241
00:16:25.589 --> 00:16:28.391
Uh, I... I don't know.

242
00:16:28.425 --> 00:16:30.393
I don't even know
what chairs you want.


243
00:16:30.427 --> 00:16:31.929
Plus, you'll change everything
around anyway.


244
00:16:31.963 --> 00:16:33.798
Not if you do it right
the first time.


245
00:16:35.432 --> 00:16:37.835
So grab some chairs,
put 'em stage right.


246
00:16:37.869 --> 00:16:39.070
Stage right?

247
00:16:39.103 --> 00:16:39.937
Where's the stage?

248
00:16:39.971 --> 00:16:41.038
You know...

249
00:16:42.439 --> 00:16:44.041
Look,
you know what I'm talkin' about.


250
00:16:44.075 --> 00:16:45.076
You see us outside

251
00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:46.610
creating a space
for the audition,


252
00:16:46.643 --> 00:16:49.546
a stage-like space.

253
00:16:49.579 --> 00:16:50.948
I'm doin' the best I can
and you're just...


254
00:16:50.982 --> 00:16:52.784
I'm what?

255
00:16:54.886 --> 00:16:57.054
Just get some chairs
and bring them outside.


256
00:17:20.377 --> 00:17:22.746
We'd like to say thank you
for giving us


257
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.549
this opportunity to bring

258
00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:28.652
our traditional dance
into an old story


259
00:17:28.685 --> 00:17:30.822
and make it our own.

260
00:17:30.855 --> 00:17:33.858
I teach tradition,
not addiction.


261
00:17:33.891 --> 00:17:37.427
Historic pain,
being stomped out.


262
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.797

00:19:52.163 --> 00:19:55.166
It was nice meeting you, Carlos.

267
00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:56.633
Hey Carlos,
get this stuff put up, alright?


268
00:19:56.666 --> 00:19:57.600
I'ma go talk to 'em.

269
00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:09.814
Need help?

270
00:20:09.847 --> 00:20:10.948
Whatever, man.

271
00:20:10.982 --> 00:20:12.682
What's your problem?

272
00:20:12.716 --> 00:20:14.185
I don't have a problem.

273
00:20:14.218 --> 00:20:15.953
I don't wanna
trip over your stupid crap.


274
00:20:15.987 --> 00:20:17.520
Thi... this isn't crap.

275
00:20:17.554 --> 00:20:19.522
It's not my job
to pick up your chairs.


276
00:20:19.556 --> 00:20:21.959
No one asked you to.
Why you being such a punk?


277
00:20:21.993 --> 00:20:23.227
You callin' me a punk?

278
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.096
- Hey, stop!
- He was being such a j...


279
00:20:25.129 --> 00:20:26.263
I don't care, get in there!

280
00:20:29.766 --> 00:20:30.968
Hey, what happened?

281
00:20:31.002 --> 00:20:32.069
I don't even know.

282
00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:39.777
- Carlos.
- No, he started it.


283
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.247
No, you're tryin'
to create chaos.


284
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.049
I get it.

285
00:20:45.082 --> 00:20:46.616
Alright,
you don't wanna be here,


286
00:20:46.649 --> 00:20:47.517
but that
does not give you the right


287
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.153
to lash out at someone
and assault them.


288
00:20:49.186 --> 00:20:50.287
Oh, so now you're
takin' his side, huh?


289
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:53.556
I'm not taking any sides.

290
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.558
This is my job.

291
00:20:55.592 --> 00:20:56.760
Whose side are you on?

292
00:20:58.062 --> 00:20:58.929
Whatever.

293
00:21:06.904 --> 00:21:10.341
Hey, I think you two
just got off on the wrong foot.


294
00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:12.742
Carlos was just about
to apologize.


295
00:21:12.777 --> 00:21:13.944
No, I wasn't.

296
00:21:17.181 --> 00:21:20.251
Fine, I'm... I'm sorry.

297
00:21:20.284 --> 00:21:21.352
Me, too.

298
00:21:21.385 --> 00:21:23.753
I don't know
how it got so messed up.


299
00:21:23.788 --> 00:21:24.855
Thank you.

300
00:21:31.761 --> 00:21:32.629
Hey, I'm sorry.

301
00:21:32.662 --> 00:21:33.464
No, it's alright, man.

302
00:21:33.497 --> 00:21:36.733
He's a missile
lookin' for a mark.


303
00:21:36.766 --> 00:21:38.035
He's angry.

304
00:21:38.069 --> 00:21:40.237
Hey, so were you, so was I.

305
00:21:41.172 --> 00:21:42.039
Come on, man.

306
00:21:42.073 --> 00:21:44.275
We were breakin' knuckles
just like that


307
00:21:44.308 --> 00:21:45.876
before we started breakin'
for fun.


308
00:21:47.211 --> 00:21:48.379
And now look at you, huh?

309
00:21:48.412 --> 00:21:49.646
Legislator.

310
00:21:54.085 --> 00:21:55.319
I don't know if I can do this.

311
00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.922
Come on, man, you can do it.

312
00:21:57.955 --> 00:21:59.656
Just take it one day at a time.

313
00:22:01.658 --> 00:22:02.927
One day at a time.

314
00:22:13.838 --> 00:22:16.107
You stay in the car.

315
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.241
What? Aren't we eating?

316
00:22:17.274 --> 00:22:18.909
Yes, but I'm getting it to go.

317
00:22:18.943 --> 00:22:19.910
You wait in the car.

318
00:22:19.944 --> 00:22:21.711
I thought you were so jacked
about this place.


319
00:22:21.744 --> 00:22:22.913
You've been talkin'
about the tacos all day.


320
00:22:22.947 --> 00:22:24.181
I know.

321
00:22:24.215 --> 00:22:26.250
But now I'm gettin' it to go
and we're gonna eat it at home.


322
00:22:26.283 --> 00:22:28.685
- Why?
- 'Cause you picked a fight.


323
00:22:28.718 --> 00:22:30.154
If I can't trust you at my work,

324
00:22:30.187 --> 00:22:31.956
how can I trust you
with one of my oldest friends?


325
00:22:31.989 --> 00:22:33.756
It's all over, we made up.

326
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:35.025
It's not over for me!

327
00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:37.027
I have to have a modicum
of trust for you.


328
00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:38.329
Dude, what's even a modicum?

329
00:22:38.362 --> 00:22:39.864
Startin' place.

330
00:22:39.897 --> 00:22:41.332
Ground zero of trust

331
00:22:41.365 --> 00:22:43.200
that you're not gonna bow up
at everybody in your path!


332
00:22:43.234 --> 00:22:44.135
Dude, you suck!

333
00:22:44.168 --> 00:22:45.202
Uh-huh.

334
00:22:47.404 --> 00:22:48.772
Maybe next time.

335
00:22:57.148 --> 00:22:58.382
What am I supposed to do
with this?


336
00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:02.453
Fix it or buy a new one.

337
00:23:02.486 --> 00:23:03.653
How am I supposed to do that?

338
00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:07.124
You'll start tomorrow mornin',
workin' at the rec center.


339
00:23:07.158 --> 00:23:08.325
What?

340
00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:11.929
Yeah, I told James
about your fight in Concho.


341
00:23:11.962 --> 00:23:13.730
He's puttin' you on probation.

342
00:23:13.763 --> 00:23:14.932
You're workin' for Reggie.

343
00:23:17.134 --> 00:23:18.435
While you head back out
on the road, huh?


344
00:23:18.469 --> 00:23:19.669
Just like old times.

345
00:23:19.702 --> 00:23:25.009
No, actually, I'm staying here,
watchin' auditions online.


346
00:23:25.042 --> 00:23:26.010
That's stupid.

347
00:23:26.043 --> 00:23:28.745
You're right, but I don't really
have a choice.


348
00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:31.382
You're my responsibility now,
so we have to stay put


349
00:23:31.415 --> 00:23:33.250
until we can figure out
how to get along.


350
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:35.953
You may be here a while.

351
00:23:35.986 --> 00:23:37.254
Well, I got plenty of time.

352
00:23:38.755 --> 00:23:39.890
See you at 6:00 a.m.

353
00:23:41.325 --> 00:23:42.193
Whatever.

354
00:24:21.865 --> 00:24:23.968
Get up!

355
00:24:24.001 --> 00:24:25.202
It's time for work.

356
00:24:25.236 --> 00:24:26.237
I'll see you downstairs.

357
00:24:33.577 --> 00:24:35.012
You a coffee man?

358
00:24:35.045 --> 00:24:36.880
Yeah.

359
00:24:36.914 --> 00:24:38.849
Have at it.

360
00:24:38.882 --> 00:24:39.984
Question.

361
00:24:40.017 --> 00:24:43.554
Why was your pillow
in front of my room last night?


362
00:24:43.587 --> 00:24:47.091
I was worried about you
and couldn't sleep well.


363
00:24:47.124 --> 00:24:49.560
So I camped in front
of your room last night.


364
00:24:49.593 --> 00:24:51.328
Why?
You think I'm gonna run away?


365
00:24:51.362 --> 00:24:52.429
I wasn't worried about that yet.

366
00:24:52.463 --> 00:24:54.131
Now I am.

367
00:24:54.164 --> 00:24:55.332
Are you gonna run away?

368
00:24:55.366 --> 00:24:57.001
No.

369
00:24:57.034 --> 00:24:58.302
Good.

370
00:24:58.335 --> 00:24:59.570
One less thing.

371
00:25:03.307 --> 00:25:06.510
I really am not tryin'
to fight with you.


372
00:25:06.543 --> 00:25:07.945
I just wanna keep you safe.

373
00:25:07.978 --> 00:25:09.280
By keeping me a prisoner?

374
00:25:09.313 --> 00:25:11.248
Come on, you didn't even know
I was out there!


375
00:25:12.316 --> 00:25:13.484
You want more coffee?

376
00:25:13.517 --> 00:25:14.818
Yeah.

377
00:25:14.852 --> 00:25:15.552
Have at it.

378
00:25:19.356 --> 00:25:21.292
Officer James will be here
in 10 minutes.


379
00:25:21.325 --> 00:25:22.559
No, I wanna ride my skateboard.

380
00:25:22.593 --> 00:25:26.297
It's probation, not camp.

381
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.965
Be ready when he gets here.

382
00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:31.001
Good morning!

383
00:25:31.035 --> 00:25:32.870
Reggie is excited
to have your help this week.


384
00:25:39.977 --> 00:25:42.179
Thank you so much
for bein' so flexible.


385
00:25:42.212 --> 00:25:44.014
You know I'd rather see you all
in person.


386
00:25:44.048 --> 00:25:46.216
Hey, D Money, it's me.

387
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:47.851
You're doin' the right thing.

388
00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:51.055
Besides, my son's a maniac
with his new camera.


389
00:25:51.088 --> 00:25:53.490
- Hi.
- He's dyin' to show it off.


390
00:25:53.524 --> 00:25:55.125
So do you wanna
talk about your concept


391
00:25:55.159 --> 00:25:56.126
or just dive in?

392
00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.561
Let's dive in.

393
00:25:57.594 --> 00:26:01.131
No, actually, wait,
I'll tell you.


394
00:26:01.165 --> 00:26:03.167
Our approach
to the Chinese dance


395
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.004
is about the annoying tendency
to label all Asians as Chinese.


396
00:26:08.405 --> 00:26:09.640
Wow. Really?

397
00:26:09.673 --> 00:26:10.341
<i>Yeah.</i>

398
00:26:10.374 --> 00:26:12.242
When people are mad at China,

399
00:26:12.276 --> 00:26:13.577
they yell at me
in the grocery store.


400
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.445
And I'm Korean.

401
00:26:15.814 --> 00:26:17.981
<i>So our
dance breaks down the caricature</i>


402
00:26:18.015 --> 00:26:19.917
of the original
Tchaikovsky version


403
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.887
to reveal the diversity
within all Asian culture.


404
00:26:23.921 --> 00:26:25.656
Wow!

405
00:26:25.689 --> 00:26:28.258
That's not the direction
my mind was headed in at all.


406
00:26:28.292 --> 00:26:30.227
<i>What did you expect?</i>

407
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.095
I thought
you were gonna lean


408
00:26:31.128 --> 00:26:33.197
into the model minority
stereotype.


409
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.667
But this... this is richer.

410
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.569
You're kind of a genius,
you know that?


411
00:26:38.602 --> 00:26:40.938
No, just Asian.

412
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:42.906
That's the cool part about
letting people tell


413
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.274
their own stories.

414
00:26:44.308 --> 00:26:46.377
You ready?

415
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.011
Let's switch into the camera.

416
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:47.731
She hasn't been doing
the things yet.


417
00:28:47.764 --> 00:28:49.733
I just got done outside.
Is that all?


418
00:28:49.766 --> 00:28:51.068
Let me call you back.

419
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:53.737
Come have a seat.

420
00:28:57.407 --> 00:28:59.142
You did a really good job
out front.


421
00:29:00.544 --> 00:29:02.045
Did you give any more thought
to what we talked about


422
00:29:02.079 --> 00:29:03.080
this mornin'?

423
00:29:03.113 --> 00:29:04.181
You mean that creepy shed?

424
00:29:05.182 --> 00:29:06.617
No.

425
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.653
I mean what happens to you
when you get angry.


426
00:29:09.686 --> 00:29:11.488
No.

427
00:29:11.522 --> 00:29:12.689
Okay.

428
00:29:13.624 --> 00:29:15.592
That other night
when you got in trouble here


429
00:29:15.626 --> 00:29:19.831
and I yelled at you
to stop fighting.


430
00:29:19.864 --> 00:29:22.032
Would you like to learn
how to stop yourself?


431
00:29:23.835 --> 00:29:24.735
I guess.

432
00:29:25.837 --> 00:29:27.538
You guess?

433
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:29.673
So you just wanna
keep gettin' in trouble


434
00:29:29.706 --> 00:29:31.074
and keep fightin'?

435
00:29:32.376 --> 00:29:33.477
No.

436
00:29:35.245 --> 00:29:37.681
Did you know
that when you get angry,


437
00:29:37.714 --> 00:29:39.750
you stop breathing?

438
00:29:39.784 --> 00:29:41.218
I hadn't noticed.

439
00:29:42.553 --> 00:29:44.856
You're doin' it right now.

440
00:29:44.889 --> 00:29:46.623
You're shoulders are tight,

441
00:29:46.657 --> 00:29:48.292
and you're becoming
more agitated


442
00:29:48.325 --> 00:29:49.827
and more uncomfortable.

443
00:29:51.495 --> 00:29:56.199
When you don't breathe,
your brain can't work.


444
00:29:56.233 --> 00:30:00.237
Your decision maker,
your pre-frontal cortex,


445
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.539
needs air to function.

446
00:30:02.573 --> 00:30:04.741
No air, no good decisions.

447
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.245
So take a deep breath.

448
00:30:13.417 --> 00:30:15.352
Man, come on, seriously.

449
00:30:15.385 --> 00:30:19.289
Do it. Take a deep breath in.

450
00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:23.126
And breathe out.

451
00:30:35.606 --> 00:30:36.673
How'd that feel?

452
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.879
I... I guess I feel more calm.

453
00:30:41.913 --> 00:30:44.448
You look more calm to me.

454
00:30:44.481 --> 00:30:45.817
So is that all?

455
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.384
No.

456
00:30:48.619 --> 00:30:50.220
But it's a good start.

457
00:30:54.191 --> 00:30:55.292
I... I get a tablet?

458
00:30:55.325 --> 00:30:56.828
Sort of.

459
00:30:56.861 --> 00:30:58.930
There's no internet on here,

460
00:30:58.963 --> 00:31:01.531
but this device is filled
with great resources


461
00:31:01.565 --> 00:31:04.401
available to you
anytime you need 'em.


462
00:31:04.434 --> 00:31:06.269
Like this really cool
breathin' app


463
00:31:06.303 --> 00:31:07.571
I think you should check out.

464
00:31:09.673 --> 00:31:11.441
Okay?

465
00:31:11.475 --> 00:31:12.476
Let's get you home.

466
00:31:31.528 --> 00:31:32.897
I got your audition papers.

467
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:33.898
Is that all today?

468
00:31:33.931 --> 00:31:35.699
Not by a long shot.

469
00:31:35.732 --> 00:31:37.234
Come on.

470
00:31:37.267 --> 00:31:38.669
I've mowed lawns
and pulled weeds


471
00:31:38.702 --> 00:31:40.404
for two weeks straight.

472
00:31:40.437 --> 00:31:41.605
What's it gonna take for you
to trust me?


473
00:31:41.638 --> 00:31:44.641
Well, I'm about to trust you
with these expensive posters


474
00:31:44.675 --> 00:31:46.677
and two of my most important
dancers.


475
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:47.511
Give you a chance to work

476
00:31:47.544 --> 00:31:50.447
on those
peer-to-peer relationships.


477
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.448
<i>Hello?</i>

478
00:31:52.582 --> 00:31:54.551
Uh, are you Dross Meyer,
the director?


479
00:31:54.584 --> 00:31:55.887
Yes.

480
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.788
<i>Oh, good.</i>

481
00:31:56.821 --> 00:31:58.790
Uh, I'm gettin' this setup
for my dad.


482
00:31:58.823 --> 00:32:01.391
- Yeah, me, too.
- Oh.


483
00:32:01.425 --> 00:32:02.894
Yeah, thank you.

484
00:32:04.628 --> 00:32:06.363
Uh, Carlos.

485
00:32:06.396 --> 00:32:07.531
Clarissa.

486
00:32:07.564 --> 00:32:08.498
Nice to meet you.

487
00:32:08.532 --> 00:32:10.233
Nice to meet you, too.

488
00:32:10.267 --> 00:32:13.403
So uh, you a dancer?

489
00:32:13.437 --> 00:32:14.538
Yeah.

490
00:32:18.475 --> 00:32:20.577
Well, I guess
I better go get my dad.


491
00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:21.946
Yeah, okay, right.

492
00:32:21.979 --> 00:32:24.782
Uh, nice to meet you.

493
00:32:24.816 --> 00:32:25.783
You, too.

494
00:32:26.851 --> 00:32:28.719
Dad, fixed it!

495
00:32:33.024 --> 00:32:34.658
Hey, how's it goin'?

496
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:35.759
I'm Daniel.

497
00:32:35.793 --> 00:32:37.561
Carlos.
I saw you guys at the show.


498
00:32:37.594 --> 00:32:38.562
You guys are good.

499
00:32:38.595 --> 00:32:39.396
Thanks.

500
00:32:39.429 --> 00:32:43.467
Ah, my good friend, Carlos!

501
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.036
That's right,
you're workin' for me today.


502
00:32:45.069 --> 00:32:46.269

510
00:33:11.762 --> 00:33:12.830
Alright, hey.

511
00:33:12.864 --> 00:33:14.397
So we're gonna start here,
work up to 36th Street,


512
00:33:14.431 --> 00:33:15.599
then back down. Sounds good?

513
00:33:15.632 --> 00:33:16.968
- Great. Yeah.
- Alright.


514
00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:26.878
- How're you?
- Doing good, doing good.


515
00:33:26.911 --> 00:33:27.744
Oh, right back there.

516
00:33:27.779 --> 00:33:28.678
Alright, sounds good.

517
00:33:28.712 --> 00:33:29.713
Come on.

518
00:33:35.352 --> 00:33:36.319
Ooh.

519
00:33:37.754 --> 00:33:38.923
Wow.

520
00:33:38.956 --> 00:33:40.557
So how do you guys
even know my dad?


521
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:41.793
I've been watchin'
his videos online


522
00:33:41.826 --> 00:33:42.860
since I was little.

523
00:33:42.894 --> 00:33:43.961
What videos?

524
00:33:43.995 --> 00:33:46.329
You don't even know
about your dad's dance videos?


525
00:33:46.363 --> 00:33:47.932
Man, give me that.

526
00:33:47.965 --> 00:33:50.034
Trippin'.

527
00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:52.036
Are you sure that's him?

528
00:33:52.069 --> 00:33:53.905
Your dad is the reason
why I started dancin'.


529
00:33:53.938 --> 00:33:55.572
It's definitely him.

530
00:33:55.605 --> 00:33:56.908
Too bad
I didn't know he existed.


531
00:34:31.809 --> 00:34:32.844
Do you need something else?

532
00:34:32.877 --> 00:34:35.378
- Oh, actually, I was...
- Oh, excuse me.


533
00:34:35.412 --> 00:34:37.782
Actually, I'm Carlos's boss uh,
Michael.


534
00:34:37.815 --> 00:34:39.083
By any chance, do you dance?

535
00:34:39.116 --> 00:34:40.750
Yes, I do actually.

536
00:34:40.785 --> 00:34:42.920
- I do Mexican folkloric.
- Okay, awesome.


537
00:34:42.954 --> 00:34:46.023
Well, we'd love to see you
at the dance audition.


538
00:34:46.057 --> 00:34:47.024
Tell your friends.

539
00:34:49.426 --> 00:34:51.028
You guys want me to go in
and get us pocket shots?


540
00:34:51.062 --> 00:34:52.729
They're the cheapest in town.

541
00:34:52.762 --> 00:34:54.966
Are you tryin'
to get your ass kicked?


542
00:34:54.999 --> 00:34:56.700
Just kidding.

543
00:34:56.733 --> 00:34:57.969
Man, it's not funny.

544
00:34:58.002 --> 00:34:59.971
Look, you can't drink and dance.

545
00:35:00.004 --> 00:35:01.571
Your dad taught us that.

546
00:35:01.605 --> 00:35:02.940
Yeah, the absinthe addict.

547
00:35:02.974 --> 00:35:04.674
Yeah, your dad,
the recoverin' addict,


548
00:35:04.708 --> 00:35:07.444
who overcame a ton more
than you have ever faced.


549
00:35:07.477 --> 00:35:08.880
Who made himself great.

550
00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:13.117
Man, let's see what you do.

551
00:35:30.067 --> 00:35:32.502
Oh great!
Smells like spaghetti, again.


552
00:35:32.535 --> 00:35:34.504
Yeah, I make my own sauce.

553
00:35:34.537 --> 00:35:36.007
I know, four days a week.

554
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.542
But homemade.

555
00:35:39.576 --> 00:35:40.978
How'd it go today?

556
00:35:41.012 --> 00:35:41.946
It was good.

557
00:35:41.979 --> 00:35:43.848
Uh, I think Michael's still
pissed at me,


558
00:35:43.881 --> 00:35:44.949
so they kinda treated me
like their...


559
00:35:44.982 --> 00:35:46.784
Work horse?

560
00:35:46.817 --> 00:35:49.020
Yeah, their work horse.

561
00:35:49.053 --> 00:35:52.223
Um, so can I ask you a question?

562
00:35:52.256 --> 00:35:53.224
Shoot.

563
00:35:53.257 --> 00:35:54.624
Who was that girl
on the meeting


564
00:35:54.658 --> 00:35:56.027
that you had today?

565
00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.828
There was a girl?

566
00:35:57.862 --> 00:35:58.796
Yeah.

567
00:36:00.497 --> 00:36:02.766
Oh, that girl.

568
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.037
Yeah, her dad runs
the Mexican Folkloric Company.


569
00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.505
So can I go to that audition?

570
00:36:08.538 --> 00:36:10.007
We'll see.

571
00:36:10.041 --> 00:36:14.178
We got another trip tomorrow
and if that goes well, maybe.


572
00:36:14.211 --> 00:36:15.146
Maybe?

573
00:36:15.179 --> 00:36:17.647
Yeah, maybe.

574
00:36:17.681 --> 00:36:18.615
I can work with maybe.

575
00:36:18.648 --> 00:36:21.152
Alright. Wash your hands, man.

576
00:36:30.795 --> 00:36:32.797
Go say "hi" to my dad
while I get set up.


577
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:33.965
He's in the wood shop.

578
00:36:33.998 --> 00:36:35.199
You're not goin', too?

579
00:36:35.232 --> 00:36:36.633
He knows you're comin'.

580
00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:37.201
But where...

581
00:36:37.234 --> 00:36:40.237
Hey, you got this.

582
00:36:40.271 --> 00:36:41.538
I believe in you.

583
00:36:46.576 --> 00:36:48.112
Hello?

584
00:36:48.145 --> 00:36:49.546
Carlos?

585
00:36:52.016 --> 00:36:53.583
Let me see that Nutcracker.

586
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:04.627
Um, pass me the wood glue
and that rubber hammer.


587
00:37:06.797 --> 00:37:09.033
Uh, Dross says
you can fix anything.


588
00:37:12.269 --> 00:37:16.107
He looks a little beat down,
but not defeated.


589
00:37:20.744 --> 00:37:22.880
How'd you break this soldier?

590
00:37:22.913 --> 00:37:24.681
You're a little old
to be playing with toys.


591
00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.320
I uh, broke him in a fight.

592
00:37:29.353 --> 00:37:32.089
Hmm, fighter, huh?

593
00:37:32.123 --> 00:37:33.958
I guess.

594
00:37:33.991 --> 00:37:35.826
I was a fighter

595
00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.195
till I got all the fight
knocked out of me.


596
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.632
Vietnam, right?

597
00:37:42.665 --> 00:37:45.169
The war and after the war.

598
00:37:45.202 --> 00:37:48.239
Put a little wood glue there.

599
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.677
Like PTSD?

600
00:37:54.711 --> 00:37:59.083
Whatever you call it,
I was broken.


601
00:37:59.116 --> 00:38:02.286
I wasn't there for your father,
so I lost him.


602
00:38:04.355 --> 00:38:06.190
I thought my grandparents
made him go away.


603
00:38:06.223 --> 00:38:08.859
He wasn't their responsibility.

604
00:38:08.893 --> 00:38:12.229
I wasn't there for him,
so he wasn't there for you.


605
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.067
But we're all here now.

606
00:38:18.235 --> 00:38:20.304
You make all this stuff
with your hands?


607
00:38:20.337 --> 00:38:21.972
Mmhmm.

608
00:38:22.006 --> 00:38:24.674
Well, uh, maybe one day
you could show me how?


609
00:38:24.707 --> 00:38:26.043
Oh, I'd like that.

610
00:38:28.913 --> 00:38:32.783
I think your Nutcracker
will live to fight another day.


611
00:38:32.817 --> 00:38:34.617
Should we go and see
what your dad's doin'


612
00:38:34.651 --> 00:38:36.153
with the really old people?

613
00:38:42.126 --> 00:38:43.626
Nice to meet you, Carlos.

614
00:38:51.135 --> 00:38:54.671
Since we don't believe
in limitations,


615
00:38:54.704 --> 00:38:58.876
our dance is about
all the unique physical skills


616
00:38:58.909 --> 00:39:03.080
each of us possess
in every phase of our lives.


617
00:39:03.114 --> 00:39:05.416
I'd like to say something, too.

618
00:39:05.449 --> 00:39:08.018
Now I would just like
to thank my son


619
00:39:08.052 --> 00:39:10.187
for making us a part
of this show,


620
00:39:10.221 --> 00:39:13.057
and most importantly
for bringing my grandson


621
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.624
to meet me.

622
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:09.346
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.


623
00:40:12.016 --> 00:40:13.683
D... do you think
I'm gonna become an addict?


624
00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:19.290
Uh, I... I don't know.

625
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.464
Do you think you are?

626
00:40:29.766 --> 00:40:30.733
I don't know.

627
00:40:32.536 --> 00:40:34.737
What's got you thinkin'
about it?


628
00:40:37.107 --> 00:40:43.847
Well, um, you, mom, and grandpa,
all have the same problems.


629
00:40:43.881 --> 00:40:46.016
I can't keep myself out
of trouble.


630
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:49.752
Oh, Carlos, man...

631
00:40:52.957 --> 00:40:56.393
Our history doesn't have
to dictate your future.


632
00:40:56.427 --> 00:41:01.332
I... I think you're angry, sure,
you...


633
00:41:01.365 --> 00:41:02.866
You got some anxiety,

634
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.904
you're startin'
to self-medicate.


635
00:41:06.937 --> 00:41:09.440
That does not mean you have to
keep goin' down this path.


636
00:41:12.977 --> 00:41:14.945
You have to learn
how to make better decisions.


637
00:41:16.814 --> 00:41:19.049
Your mom and I
cannot make them for you.


638
00:41:22.052 --> 00:41:24.221
I haven't seen mom
since she got arrested.


639
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.496
Okay. Do you want to?

640
00:41:34.398 --> 00:41:36.433
I think so.

641
00:41:36.467 --> 00:41:37.868
Alright.

642
00:41:40.004 --> 00:41:41.171
Alright.

643
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.024
Nice to see you guys.

644
00:42:34.058 --> 00:42:35.559
Uh, hey, water?

645
00:42:35.592 --> 00:42:38.462
Um, no, I'm fine for now.

646
00:42:38.495 --> 00:42:40.464
Uh, is there anything you need?

647
00:42:40.497 --> 00:42:41.932
Hi, how're you doing?
How're you doing?


648
00:42:41.965 --> 00:42:45.369
No, thank you.
We're fine over here.


649
00:42:45.402 --> 00:42:48.205
Jorge, Adelita,
that's my son Carlos.


650
00:42:55.679 --> 00:42:56.547
Uh, hey.

651
00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:57.548
Hey.

652
00:43:00.117 --> 00:43:02.052
I'm excited to see you dance.

653
00:43:02.086 --> 00:43:04.455
Don't. That's just gonna make me
even more nervous.


654
00:43:04.488 --> 00:43:06.123
Oh, s... sorry.

655
00:43:06.156 --> 00:43:09.026
It's okay.
Um, so you work with your dad?


656
00:43:09.059 --> 00:43:09.893
Yeah.

657
00:43:09.927 --> 00:43:12.196
I'm basically his... the...
the assist...


658
00:43:12.229 --> 00:43:14.398
The assistant director, so...

659
00:43:15.065 --> 00:43:16.066
That's cool.

660
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.637
Yeah, we just go around, travel
and... and stuff.


661
00:43:20.671 --> 00:43:21.905
Cool.

662
00:43:24.375 --> 00:43:25.442
Clarissa!

663
00:43:30.981 --> 00:43:34.184
Folklorico is storytelling
in dance.


664
00:43:34.218 --> 00:43:36.053
We were drawn to the music
of the Spanish Chocolate


665
00:43:36.086 --> 00:43:37.521
in the original.

666
00:43:37.554 --> 00:43:40.591
Spain had invaded Mexico
centuries ago,


667
00:43:40.624 --> 00:43:43.360
so their culture is already
deeply embedded in ours.


668
00:43:43.394 --> 00:43:46.430
But cacao and chocolate

669
00:43:46.463 --> 00:43:48.966
were already part
of the indigenous Mayan culture.


670
00:43:48.999 --> 00:43:52.336
So when we stomp,
when we get low,


671
00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:54.071
we're connecting
with our Mayan history.


672
00:45:33.203 --> 00:45:35.072
Hey Carlos,
we're gonna break for lunch


673
00:45:35.105 --> 00:45:35.807
and have a chat.

674
00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.641
Do you wanna come or stay here?

675
00:45:37.674 --> 00:45:38.810
We packed a lunch.

676
00:45:38.843 --> 00:45:40.344
Do you wanna share with me?

677
00:45:40.377 --> 00:45:41.345
Sure.

678
00:45:41.378 --> 00:45:42.513
We'll stay.

679
00:45:44.248 --> 00:45:45.349
Okay.

680
00:45:49.419 --> 00:45:51.221
You were great out there.

681
00:45:51.255 --> 00:45:53.123
You didn't even seem nervous.

682
00:45:53.156 --> 00:45:56.159
Oh, my mom taught me to dance
to help with my anxiety.


683
00:45:56.193 --> 00:45:58.195
You have anxiety?

684
00:45:58.228 --> 00:46:00.597
Yeah, my parents
just expect a lot from me.


685
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:02.266
School sucks.

686
00:46:02.299 --> 00:46:05.135
Yeah, school does suck.

687
00:46:05.168 --> 00:46:07.437
My dad thinks
I have anxiety, too, so...


688
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:09.573
Really? What do you think?

689
00:46:11.208 --> 00:46:13.176
I... I don't know.

690
00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.711
But maybe your dancing
can help me.


691
00:46:14.745 --> 00:46:15.445
Maybe.

692
00:46:21.685 --> 00:46:24.621
Okay, dance is all about breath.

693
00:46:24.655 --> 00:46:27.524
Okay, but why is everyone
so obsessed with breathing?


694
00:46:27.558 --> 00:46:31.295
My mom says the fastest way
to calm yourself is the easiest.


695
00:46:31.328 --> 00:46:32.296
Breathe.

696
00:48:12.763 --> 00:48:14.164
Great job.

697
00:48:15.732 --> 00:48:17.234
Now hurry up,
I'm gonna be late for work.


698
00:48:18.435 --> 00:48:20.237
Sorry, I forgot. I have to go.

699
00:48:33.383 --> 00:48:34.718
What's up?

700
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:36.821
Nothing.

701
00:48:36.854 --> 00:48:38.722
Why're you in bad mood?

702
00:48:38.755 --> 00:48:39.891
Doesn't matter.

703
00:48:41.025 --> 00:48:43.360
Nothing ever works out for me.

704
00:48:43.393 --> 00:48:45.228
What about Clarissa?

705
00:48:45.262 --> 00:48:46.763
I think she has a boyfriend.

706
00:48:46.798 --> 00:48:48.498
You think?

707
00:48:48.532 --> 00:48:51.368
Dude, you have got to learn
how to deal with adversity.


708
00:48:51.401 --> 00:48:54.571
You can't just give up anytime
things don't go your way.


709
00:48:54.604 --> 00:48:56.339
Says the dude who left
for 16 years.


710
00:48:57.775 --> 00:49:00.310
Yeah.

711
00:49:00.343 --> 00:49:02.479
And all 16 years of those years
were filled with adversity.


712
00:49:04.681 --> 00:49:05.649
But you're right.

713
00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:09.386
I should have been there.

714
00:49:09.419 --> 00:49:13.791
It took me way too long
to get here,


715
00:49:13.825 --> 00:49:16.760
but I made it here today
to be with you.


716
00:49:22.566 --> 00:49:23.935
One day at a time.

717
00:49:48.692 --> 00:49:50.327
I'll be right here
if you need me.


718
00:49:52.964 --> 00:49:54.799
Hi honey!

719
00:49:54.832 --> 00:49:57.300
Oh God, I'm so glad to see you.

720
00:49:57.334 --> 00:49:58.335
Oh!

721
00:50:01.873 --> 00:50:03.273
Um, do you wanna sit?

722
00:50:04.842 --> 00:50:05.777
Okay.

723
00:50:08.378 --> 00:50:09.613
So you and your dad, huh?

724
00:50:11.082 --> 00:50:13.985
Well, how's that going?
What's it like?


725
00:50:14.018 --> 00:50:16.686
It's good.
Um, I met Grandpa Joe.


726
00:50:18.488 --> 00:50:20.357
We're going around,
looking at acts and stuff.


727
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.958
It's pretty fun.

728
00:50:20.992 --> 00:50:24.361
Good. I'm so glad.

729
00:50:26.097 --> 00:50:30.634
I uh... uh, I...
I talked to my parents.


730
00:50:30.667 --> 00:50:35.338
They said you've been
having some trouble.


731
00:50:35.372 --> 00:50:39.376
So? What do you care?
You're not even there.


732
00:50:39.409 --> 00:50:40.845
I care, because I'm your mom.

733
00:50:40.878 --> 00:50:42.546
You're not taking care of me.

734
00:50:42.579 --> 00:50:45.082
Honey, there is nothing
I would rather do


735
00:50:45.116 --> 00:50:47.684
than to be able
to take care of you.


736
00:50:47.717 --> 00:50:50.054
But right now,
I have to take care of myself,


737
00:50:50.087 --> 00:50:52.489
so I can be
a mom to you again.

738
00:50:54.892 --> 00:50:56.626
Why wasn't I enough for you
to stop?


739
00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:57.727
No, no, no, no.

740
00:50:57.761 --> 00:51:01.799
It was never a choice
between you and the drugs.


741
00:51:01.833 --> 00:51:04.701
I... I understand if you
don't believe that right now,


742
00:51:04.734 --> 00:51:06.804
but it's a disease.

743
00:51:06.838 --> 00:51:10.875
I promise I am... I am trying,
honey, I really am,


744
00:51:10.908 --> 00:51:12.409
and I'm learning.

745
00:51:12.442 --> 00:51:13.710
You know what?

746
00:51:13.743 --> 00:51:16.948
Have fun learning
in your little resort here.


747
00:51:16.981 --> 00:51:18.015
Carlos, please.

748
00:51:23.054 --> 00:51:24.088
Hey man, how di...

749
00:52:02.459 --> 00:52:05.196
Uh, I wanted to make you
your favorite dinner,


750
00:52:05.229 --> 00:52:06.964
but I don't know what that is.

751
00:52:08.765 --> 00:52:10.500
So I decided to make you mine.

752
00:52:10.533 --> 00:52:12.569
Roast chicken, mashed potatoes.

753
00:52:15.806 --> 00:52:17.574
You didn't even cook this.

754
00:52:17.607 --> 00:52:18.675
That's why it's my favorite.

755
00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.815
Do you wanna talk about
what happened today?


756
00:52:24.849 --> 00:52:25.883
No.

757
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:32.689
You know,
parents aren't perfect,


758
00:52:32.722 --> 00:52:35.960
but sometimes,
they can surprise you.


759
00:52:38.129 --> 00:52:41.598
My dad,
he kept all my clippings.


760
00:52:41.631 --> 00:52:43.566
He gave this to me.

761
00:52:44.534 --> 00:52:46.603
That's me when I was
in Man of La Mancha.


762
00:52:47.671 --> 00:52:49.240
I had no idea.

763
00:52:49.273 --> 00:52:51.242
Yeah, cool book.

764
00:52:51.275 --> 00:52:53.610
Good thing you left, right?

765
00:52:53.643 --> 00:52:54.078
That's not what I meant.

766
00:52:54.178 --> 00:52:56.013
No, but it is.

767
00:52:56.047 --> 00:52:59.582
You left, you made your own way.
Good for you!


768
00:52:59.616 --> 00:53:01.953
But you know what?
Mom left, too!


769
00:53:01.986 --> 00:53:03.187
Both of you left.

770
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:06.223
You left me.

771
00:53:06.257 --> 00:53:08.092
That's not what I'm...

772
00:53:08.125 --> 00:53:09.860
I wasn't in a place...

773
00:53:41.725 --> 00:53:44.661
Carlos, what's up, man?
You okay?


774
00:53:44.694 --> 00:53:45.896
You need somethin'?

775
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:46.897
Nah, I'm alright.

776
00:53:46.931 --> 00:53:47.932
Here, take a few of these.

777
00:53:49.867 --> 00:53:52.702
Oh, sick.

778
00:53:52.736 --> 00:53:55.106
Oh, you want somethin' stronger?

779
00:53:55.139 --> 00:53:55.840
Nice.

780
00:53:55.873 --> 00:53:57.640
Yeah, and no vape smell either.

781
00:53:57.674 --> 00:53:58.909
Now these are pretty strong,

782
00:53:58.943 --> 00:54:00.177
so you wanna be home
whenever they hit.


783
00:54:02.579 --> 00:54:03.713
Thanks, man.

784
00:55:18.989 --> 00:55:22.326
- Get out of here!
- It's okay.


785
00:55:22.359 --> 00:55:23.994
Leave me alone.

Dross Meyer!

798
00:57:04.828 --> 00:57:07.031
Mm, you actually came out here
to see us!


799
00:57:07.064 --> 00:57:08.299
Well, you know I was going to.

800
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.868
Hey, this is my son Carlos
that I told you about.


801
00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:11.936
Oh, well, hello.

802
00:57:11.969 --> 00:57:13.437
Welcome.

803
00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:15.139
Welcome, welcome.

804
00:57:15.172 --> 00:57:18.242
So you dance, too?

805
00:57:18.275 --> 00:57:19.877
Uh, not good.

806
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:21.378
Just regular, I guess.

807
00:57:21.412 --> 00:57:22.179
Regular?

808
00:57:22.213 --> 00:57:23.147
Don't you know everybody
can dance?


809
00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.049
Dross, I thought
you'd be teaching your boy.


810
00:57:25.082 --> 00:57:26.250
I missed a spot.

811
00:57:27.484 --> 00:57:29.286
Meet the ladies.

812
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.753
Ladies,
I'd like to introduce you


813
00:57:30.788 --> 00:57:32.389
to some important people.

814
00:57:32.423 --> 00:57:34.491
This is Dross Meyer
from way back in the day


815
00:57:34.525 --> 00:57:36.126
and his son Carlos.

816
00:57:37.428 --> 00:57:40.097
So excited to see you dance,
ladies.


817
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:42.933
I'm also excited
for my son Carlos to meet you.


818
00:57:42.967 --> 00:57:44.969
You see, he had a rough visit
with his mom


819
00:57:45.002 --> 00:57:47.538
at ReMerge the other day.

820
00:57:47.571 --> 00:57:50.040
Hey now,
we speak the truth around here.


821
00:57:51.342 --> 00:57:52.509
We don't hide from ourselves

822
00:57:52.543 --> 00:57:55.112
and we're sure not hidin'
from each other.


823
00:57:55.145 --> 00:57:59.083
Now me and your dad,
we go way back.


824
00:58:00.985 --> 00:58:02.286
Back when we was both lost.

825
00:58:02.319 --> 00:58:03.487
Hmm.

826
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.090
Now he's cleaned himself up,
found purpose.


827
00:58:06.123 --> 00:58:09.093
Me? I found jail.

828
00:58:09.126 --> 00:58:10.361
Me, too.

829
00:58:10.394 --> 00:58:12.296
There wasn't a ReMerge for me.

830
00:58:12.329 --> 00:58:14.265
Yeah, no, me neither.

831
00:58:14.298 --> 00:58:15.933
But tell me
if this sound familiar.


832
00:58:15.966 --> 00:58:16.900
Watch this.

833
00:58:16.934 --> 00:58:18.369
Gettin' kicked out of school.

834
00:58:18.402 --> 00:58:19.403
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm, yeah.


835
00:58:19.436 --> 00:58:21.105
Gettin' knocked up and or down.

836
00:58:21.138 --> 00:58:22.072
- Mm.
- Mmhmm.


837
00:58:22.106 --> 00:58:23.073
Yep.

838
00:58:23.107 --> 00:58:25.376
Wildin' out, manic, depressed,
startin' fights.


839
00:58:25.409 --> 00:58:27.344
Yep.

840
00:58:27.378 --> 00:58:28.912
And how did that work out?

841
00:58:30.447 --> 00:58:31.482
See?

842
00:58:31.515 --> 00:58:33.284
Everybody is
goin' through somethin'.


843
00:58:33.317 --> 00:58:35.419
We all came from somewhere.

844
00:58:35.452 --> 00:58:36.920
You're not alone.

845
00:58:38.389 --> 00:58:41.125
I mean really, look around.

846
00:58:41.158 --> 00:58:43.994
Do you really think
I did all this all on my own?


847
00:58:45.095 --> 00:58:46.397
I guess not.

848
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:47.965
You gu... you guess not?

849
00:58:47.998 --> 00:58:48.932
Of course not.

850
00:58:48.966 --> 00:58:50.534
I asked for help.

851
00:58:50.567 --> 00:58:52.236
And guess what else?

852
00:58:52.269 --> 00:58:53.370
I found it.

853
00:58:53.404 --> 00:58:55.372
Now the question is

854
00:58:55.406 --> 00:58:58.142
what are you gonna do
the next time you need help?


855
00:58:58.175 --> 00:58:59.276
Ask for it.

856
00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:01.512
Well, praise the Lord
and pass the potato salad y'all,


857
00:59:01.545 --> 00:59:02.379
I think he's gonna make it.

858
00:59:04.048 --> 00:59:05.182
Are y'all ready to do one?

859
00:59:05.215 --> 00:59:06.850
That's what we came here for.

860
00:59:06.884 --> 00:59:08.152

887
01:02:48.305 --> 01:02:49.673
Yeah.

888
01:02:49.706 --> 01:02:51.108
Hey Dax, we'll see you inside.

889
01:02:53.443 --> 01:02:57.414
Uh, can I take
one of your dance classes?


890
01:02:57.447 --> 01:02:59.182
I mean yeah,
that'd be great with me.


891
01:02:59.216 --> 01:03:00.517
Mi... Michael?

892
01:03:03.287 --> 01:03:05.322
Uh, I don't know, man.

893
01:03:05.355 --> 01:03:06.623
You know, you know our rules,

894
01:03:06.657 --> 01:03:09.760
and Dustin says y'all two are
still partyin'.

01:03:09.794 --> 01:03:12.496
You gotta choose.

896
01:03:12.529 --> 01:03:14.598
I know.

897
01:03:14.631 --> 01:03:16.801
Okay.

898
01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:18.235
Don't mess this up.

899
01:03:24.174 --> 01:03:25.609
Let's take that
one more time from the top.


900
01:03:25.642 --> 01:03:27.444
So first thing we do is we hop,
we hop.


901
01:03:27.477 --> 01:03:30.280
Clap, step and here, right arm.

902
01:03:30.314 --> 01:03:32.850
Hit, hit, and wooh!

903

Let's take that one more time

Click, 1, 2, bring it up.

Bring it down, nice and smooth.

Great. We got that?

910
01:03:47.731 --> 01:03:50.500

01:04:23.433 --> 01:04:25.268
<i>Bring it down, bring it down.</i>

928

Break it down, let's go.

934
01:04:45.355 --> 01:04:46.891
Nice, yeah.

935
01:05:07.912 --> 01:05:10.313
No, no, you're doing great.

936
01:05:10.347 --> 01:05:13.684
This is not...
um, thank you, son.


937
01:05:13.717 --> 01:05:16.586
This is not about changing
anything that you guys got.


938
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:20.490
It's about transitions
or just trying to you know,


939
01:05:20.524 --> 01:05:22.325
figure out how you guys
can fit into the work...


940
01:05:31.268 --> 01:05:31.869
Oh!

941
01:05:31.903 --> 01:05:33.470
Hey, don't stop!

942
01:05:33.503 --> 01:05:34.604
You scared me.

943
01:05:34.638 --> 01:05:36.808
Sorry, I didn't wanna interrupt,
but that was awesome.


944
01:05:36.841 --> 01:05:38.675
CARLOS Uh, yeah,
I was just foolin' around, though.


945
01:05:39.977 --> 01:05:41.278
Oh, you skate?

946
01:05:41.311 --> 01:05:43.480
No, but do you wanna teach me?

947
01:05:43.513 --> 01:05:44.414
I mean, sure.

948
01:05:47.284 --> 01:05:48.019
Here we go.

949
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.255
- Oh jeez.
- There you go.


950
01:05:52.289 --> 01:05:54.391
Okay, put your foot
on those screws right there.


951
01:05:54.424 --> 01:05:55.793
What? I don't think
I'm doing this right.


952
01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:58.796
Right there. You almost...
yeah, right there. Stay there.


953
01:05:58.830 --> 01:05:59.629
I don't think I got this.

954
01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:03.667
Alright, there you go.

955
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.669
Okay.

956
01:06:07.905 --> 01:06:09.673
Uh, I don't wanna get in a...
in a fight


957
01:06:09.706 --> 01:06:11.042
with someone's boyfriend.

958
01:06:11.075 --> 01:06:12.642
Boyfriend?

959
01:06:12.676 --> 01:06:15.612
Yeah, you know,
the guy at the audition


960
01:06:15.645 --> 01:06:17.481
- after we uh...
- Oh my gosh!


961
01:06:17.514 --> 01:06:18.950
That's not my boyfriend,
that's my brother.


962
01:06:18.983 --> 01:06:20.317
He was just picking me up.

963
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:22.552
- For real?
- Yes, I promise. So?


964
01:06:22.586 --> 01:06:25.823
CARLOS
So, hey.


965
01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:27.290
Hey.

966
01:06:28.425 --> 01:06:29.626
Carlos!

967
01:06:29.659 --> 01:06:31.528
Uh, you know where to find me,
right?


968
01:06:31.561 --> 01:06:32.729
I do now.

969
01:06:39.369 --> 01:06:42.006
Uh, hey, I heard you callin',
but I couldn't find you, so...


970
01:06:42.039 --> 01:06:44.374
Sorry,
it was just hectic up there.


971
01:06:44.407 --> 01:06:47.410
I needed some space to work.

972
01:06:47.444 --> 01:06:48.946
What... what you're workin' on?

973
01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.314
Casting.

974
01:06:51.348 --> 01:06:53.617
Casting, casting...

975
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:55.385
Casting.

976
01:06:55.418 --> 01:06:56.854
I thought you were done, though.

977
01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:59.791
Uh, I'm almost done,
but it's a big cast.


978
01:06:59.824 --> 01:07:01.525
I still need a Prince.

979
01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.830
I've been dancin'
with Sugar Plum, but uh,


980
01:07:05.863 --> 01:07:07.430
- I'm too, uh...
- Good?


981
01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:09.834
Old.

982
01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:11.903
Nah.

983
01:07:11.936 --> 01:07:13.436
The Prince
has to be much younger.


984
01:07:15.739 --> 01:07:20.377
If I move Michael,
then I lose the Mouse King.


985
01:07:23.114 --> 01:07:24.381
Let's head on home.

986
01:07:33.858 --> 01:07:35.993
Oh wow, you're on time!

987
01:07:51.909 --> 01:07:54.912
Yeah, you know,
I'm feelin' this vibe.


988
01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.814
But just all by myself.

989
01:07:56.848 --> 01:08:00.885
I'm not sure if it needs to be
with a Prince, you know?


990
01:08:00.918 --> 01:08:02.619
Or maybe you could teach me.

991
01:08:03.988 --> 01:08:05.957
- You wanna learn?
- Yeah.


992
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:07.124
- Really?
- Yeah.


993
01:08:07.158 --> 01:08:09.559
- You think you can?
- Yes.


994
01:08:09.593 --> 01:08:10.962
- You sure?
- Yes


995
01:08:10.995 --> 01:08:14.031
Alright, top eight, watch me.

996
01:08:14.065 --> 01:08:15.099
Flow.

997
01:08:20.972 --> 01:08:22.073
Here.

998
01:08:22.106 --> 01:08:23.841
Let's take it from there,
on my count.


999
01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:27.711
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, and...

1000
01:08:35.485 --> 01:08:37.021
Flow. Loosen up.

1001
01:08:37.054 --> 01:08:38.455
Watch me.

1002
01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:39.589
- Are you ready?
- Yes.


1003
01:08:39.623 --> 01:08:41.691
You're ready?

1004
01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:42.860
Do it with me?

1005
01:08:42.894 --> 01:08:44.829
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

1006
01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:55.705
No, no, Carlos,
you're not listening.


1007
01:08:55.739 --> 01:08:56.874
You said you're ready.

1008
01:08:56.908 --> 01:08:58.675
- Are you listening?
- Yes.


1009
01:08:58.708 --> 01:08:59.844
Let's try it again, on my count.

1010
01:08:59.877 --> 01:09:02.412
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1...

1011
01:09:05.482 --> 01:09:06.549
Flow.

1012
01:09:07.584 --> 01:09:08.853
Oh!

1013
01:09:08.886 --> 01:09:09.987
Step aside.

1014
01:09:15.259 --> 01:09:16.526
You need water.

1015
01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:23.433
You know, I've been
thinkin' a lot about you lately.


1016
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:27.570
You remind me so much
of your dad.


1017
01:09:29.773 --> 01:09:31.075
You remind me of me.

1018
01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:35.980
How's it goin' with your mom?

1019
01:09:36.013 --> 01:09:36.814
I uh...

1020
01:09:39.183 --> 01:09:41.819
I haven't gone back.

1021
01:09:41.852 --> 01:09:43.888
Hmm.

1022
01:09:43.921 --> 01:09:47.024
Do you ever go for a walk
after a big storm?


1023
01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:48.725
No.

1024
01:09:48.758 --> 01:09:52.196
I mean like on my skateboard
I guess.


1025
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:55.900
Okay, so imagine.

1026
01:09:55.933 --> 01:09:59.036
You're skating through a park
after a big storm.


1027
01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.603
What's it feel like?

1028
01:10:00.637 --> 01:10:02.739
Wet.

1029
01:10:02.772 --> 01:10:04.976
Great.

1030
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:12.216
So you're skating along,
the breeze is mostly gentle.


1031
01:10:12.249 --> 01:10:17.687
You notice a few leaves,
branches on the ground.


1032
01:10:17.721 --> 01:10:21.058
It's the calm after a storm.

1033
01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:24.261
Suddenly you hear
the pitter patter,


1034
01:10:24.295 --> 01:10:25.930
raindrops pick up.

1035
01:10:25.963 --> 01:10:29.666
You post up under a tree.

1036
01:10:29.699 --> 01:10:32.837
But your face, it's getting wet,
it's uncomfortable.


1037
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:33.838
You panic.

1038
01:10:33.871 --> 01:10:35.039
Time to go home.

1039
01:10:35.072 --> 01:10:37.842
There must be a new storm
on the way.


1040
01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:42.645
Or... is it the breeze

1041
01:10:42.679 --> 01:10:46.817
shakin' loose remaining drops
in the trees.


1042
01:10:46.851 --> 01:10:48.886
See this isn't a new storm.

1043
01:10:51.822 --> 01:10:53.257
Just the memory of an old one.

1044
01:10:55.592 --> 01:10:59.096
Just the leftover drops
hanging on


1045
01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:03.167
until the fresh wind
shook 'em free.


1046
01:11:05.769 --> 01:11:07.038
Okay, question.

1047
01:11:07.071 --> 01:11:10.941
Um, am I the storm
or am I the trees?


1048
01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:13.743
Neither.
You're still a kid


1049
01:11:13.778 --> 01:11:15.079
skating around
on your skateboard,


1050
01:11:15.112 --> 01:11:18.615
but like the tree.

1051
01:11:18.648 --> 01:11:20.951
Honey, you're gonna
go through some storms,


1052
01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:24.621
you may lose some leaves
and maybe even some branches,


1053
01:11:24.654 --> 01:11:27.291
but you hold on
to what you need,


1054
01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:30.327
and allow fresh wind
to shake free the rest.


1055
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:35.833
The bottom line is this.

1056
01:11:35.866 --> 01:11:38.936
You gotta shake off
all that weight,


1057
01:11:38.969 --> 01:11:43.307
all those drops
that are holding you down.


1058
01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.875
Don't you wanna be free?

1059
01:11:48.045 --> 01:11:49.146
Dance free?

1060
01:11:50.781 --> 01:11:54.885
Forgive your mom, your dad.

1061
01:11:54.919 --> 01:11:56.220
Forgive yourself.

1062
01:11:58.389 --> 01:12:00.657
Carlos, believe me,

1063
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:03.760
to be able to live
in total freedom,


1064
01:12:03.794 --> 01:12:07.965
you've got to let the past
stay in the past.


1065
01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:27.750
I am really glad you came back.

1066
01:12:29.787 --> 01:12:31.288
I'm sorry I didn't come
to see you.


1067
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:34.225
That's okay.
You didn't mean to...


1068
01:12:34.258 --> 01:12:36.193
Wait, let me finish.

1069
01:12:37.795 --> 01:12:40.364
I'm sorry for the way
that I acted.


1070
01:12:40.397 --> 01:12:43.300
I'm just so angry.

1071
01:12:43.334 --> 01:12:45.803
It's okay.

1072
01:12:45.836 --> 01:12:47.338
You have every right
to be angry.


1073
01:12:49.106 --> 01:12:51.674
I messed up

1074
01:12:51.708 --> 01:12:53.743
and I hate that we're both
paying the price for it.


1075
01:12:56.981 --> 01:12:59.950
I miss you so much.

1076
01:12:59.984 --> 01:13:01.785
I miss you, too.

1077
01:13:03.387 --> 01:13:04.687
Hey.

1078
01:13:06.756 --> 01:13:08.225
We're gonna get through this.

1079
01:13:08.259 --> 01:13:09.726
Hmm?

1080
01:13:09.759 --> 01:13:12.129
Okay.

1081
01:13:12.163 --> 01:13:14.431
5, 6, 7, 8.

1082
01:13:14.465 --> 01:13:18.701
And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1083
01:13:18.735 --> 01:13:20.404
7, 8.

1084
01:13:20.437 --> 01:13:25.843
2, 4, 6, 7, 8.

1085
01:13:25.876 --> 01:13:28.279
<i>♪ The world still
treats you the same ♪</i>


1086
01:13:28.312 --> 01:13:29.413
No, they're getting it together.

1087
01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:30.981
It looked good in the beginning.

1088
01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.918
Hey, uh...

1089
01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:36.287
So today you're gonna put me
on the schedule, right?


1090
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.755
Yeah, probably after lunch.

1091
01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:40.324
Alright. Sorry.

1092
01:13:40.357 --> 01:13:44.395
<i>♪ Do something new,
find new ways to be true ♪</i>


1093
01:13:44.428 --> 01:13:46.830
<i>♪ And the world,
the world can't contain ♪</i>


1094
01:13:46.864 --> 01:13:49.766
8, 2, 4.

1095
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.868
Yeah.

1096
01:13:50.901 --> 01:13:53.003
6. Right.

1097
01:13:54.104 --> 01:13:55.272
All right, Carlos, Michael,

1098
01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:56.373
we'll go ahead and take this
one more time from the top.


1099
01:13:56.407 --> 01:13:58.409
Just take it under tempo,
so we can keep it pushing.


1100
01:13:58.442 --> 01:13:59.310
Okay. Ready?

1101
01:13:59.343 --> 01:14:01.946
Uh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1102
01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:04.415
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1103
01:14:04.448 --> 01:14:06.984
1, 2, hit, 4, 5, 6.

1104
01:14:07.017 --> 01:14:09.486
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1105
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.323
1, 2, 3, 4, hold.

1106
01:14:12.356 --> 01:14:13.857
Alright, let's go. Okay?

1107
01:14:13.891 --> 01:14:15.893
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1108
01:14:15.926 --> 01:14:18.028
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1109
01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.201
1, 2, 3, uh.

1110
01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:30.241
Carlos!

1111
01:14:30.274 --> 01:14:31.809
If you can't
stop distracting my dancers,


1112
01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:32.843
then go on home!

1113
01:14:32.876 --> 01:14:34.311
We're workin' here!

1114
01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:36.780
No, no, you said I was
on the schedule this afternoon.


1115
01:14:36.814 --> 01:14:37.715
You said I could show you
all those...


1116
01:14:37.747 --> 01:14:40.818
I know what I said!
And maybe tomorrow.


1117
01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:41.986
Or you can show me
whatever it is


1118
01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:43.988
when we get home tonight,
but right now you need to go!


1119
01:14:53.597 --> 01:14:54.531
Okay.

1120
01:14:56.533 --> 01:14:58.402
Let's take it back to the top
of the second 8, alright?


1121
01:15:16.987 --> 01:15:19.089
Carlos, slow down, man.

1122
01:15:19.123 --> 01:15:20.291
You finally give up dancin'?

1123
01:15:20.324 --> 01:15:22.259
Back to actin' like a real man?

1124
01:15:22.293 --> 01:15:23.460
You're a real man?

1125
01:15:23.494 --> 01:15:25.296
More than some stupid dancer.

1126
01:15:30.034 --> 01:15:30.734
Whatever.

1127
01:15:30.768 --> 01:15:32.336
You're lucky that didn't break.

1128
01:15:43.947 --> 01:15:45.215
Phew.

1129
01:15:57.161 --> 01:15:58.896
Hey James.

1130
01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:00.931
Yeah, it's me, Carlos.

1131
01:16:00.964 --> 01:16:03.200
No, nothing's wrong, I'm okay.

1132
01:16:03.233 --> 01:16:06.170
Uh, I just wanted to say that
I tried that breathing thing,


1133
01:16:06.203 --> 01:16:07.137
it worked.

1134
01:16:09.573 --> 01:16:13.477
It's okay... not great.

1135
01:16:16.413 --> 01:16:19.049
Alright.

1136
01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:20.217
Thank you.

1137
01:16:43.374 --> 01:16:45.008
Hey man,
can I come in for a sec?


1138
01:16:48.178 --> 01:16:50.180
I'm sorry I didn't make time
for you today.


1139
01:16:50.214 --> 01:16:51.281
It's okay.

1140
01:16:57.221 --> 01:16:59.056
No, it's not.

1141
01:17:03.694 --> 01:17:05.062
You've been doing great.

1142
01:17:05.095 --> 01:17:07.898
I... I just got so caught up
in everything.


1143
01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:11.502
I'm very proud of you, though.

1144
01:17:11.535 --> 01:17:13.704
Why is that?

1145
01:17:13.737 --> 01:17:17.541
Well, I blew you off
and embarrassed you today,


1146
01:17:17.574 --> 01:17:19.076
but you handled it
like an adult.


1147
01:17:21.078 --> 01:17:23.247
How do you know?

1148
01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.417
Well, you're home, sober,

1149
01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:28.218
don't appear to have been
in a fight.


1150
01:17:33.624 --> 01:17:37.661
Uh, I talked to James today.

1151
01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:39.730
Yeah? That's great.

1152
01:17:39.763 --> 01:17:41.098
How'd that go?

1153
01:17:41.131 --> 01:17:42.065
It was good.

1154
01:17:42.099 --> 01:17:44.701
I told him I remembered
about my breathing


1155
01:17:44.735 --> 01:17:46.503
and that's what kept me
from punching Dustin, so...


1156
01:17:48.405 --> 01:17:51.074
You did the single hardest thing
any one person can do.


1157
01:17:52.476 --> 01:17:53.644
I asked for help.

1158
01:17:53.677 --> 01:17:55.579
You asked for help.

1159
01:17:57.114 --> 01:17:59.583
You remembered that
you weren't alone.


1160
01:17:59.616 --> 01:18:01.418
Well, even though, I was alone.

1161
01:18:01.452 --> 01:18:06.123
Hey, you are never alone.

1162
01:18:06.156 --> 01:18:06.990
You know that?

1163
01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:11.161
I'm proud of you, son.

1164
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:21.305
So tomorrow?

1165
01:18:21.338 --> 01:18:22.439
Are you kiddin' me?

1166
01:18:22.473 --> 01:18:25.409
Yes, you're gettin'
your audition tomorrow, Carlos.


1167
01:18:25.442 --> 01:18:26.410
Yes!

1168
01:18:29.146 --> 01:18:30.414
Goodnight.

1169
01:18:30.447 --> 01:18:31.648
Goodnight, dad.

1170
01:21:04.836 --> 01:21:06.436
I brought some friends
to see you.


1171
01:21:08.305 --> 01:21:14.177
Thank you, guys, so much for...
for everything.


1172
01:21:14.211 --> 01:21:15.379
Oh!

1173
01:21:16.781 --> 01:21:18.181
I'm sorry.

1174
01:21:18.215 --> 01:21:20.183
No, they're perfect.

1175
01:21:21.385 --> 01:21:22.552
Nice jacket.

1176
01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:25.857
Clear it out, folks,
we're starting the show.


1177
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.227
Shouldn't you be somewhere?

1178
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:47.611
Hey, I knew
you could find stage right.


1179
01:21:48.813 --> 01:21:49.613
And thank you for ever...

1180
01:21:49.646 --> 01:21:52.749
No, you did this.

1181
01:21:52.784 --> 01:21:55.853
And you worked hard,
you made it happen.


1182
01:21:55.887 --> 01:21:57.521
Turns out you made
something cooler than <i>Star Wars</i>.


1183
01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:01.258
Not a bad ending, right?

1184
01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:03.861
Oh, no, son.

1185
01:22:03.895 --> 01:22:05.362
This is just the beginnin'.
