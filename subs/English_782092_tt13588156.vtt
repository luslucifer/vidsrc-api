00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:25.389
In the history of mankind,

2
00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:27.831
has there ever been a more
obvious truth than the statement


3
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:31.329
"We are all going to die"?

4
00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:34.937
And yet, in our bones,

5
00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:39.040
how many of us can
actually conceptualize death,


6
00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:42.043
understand it?

7
00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:49.787
A lifetime.

8
00:01:49.822 --> 00:01:52.251
Life...

9
00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:54.858
time.

10
00:01:54.893 --> 00:01:57.421
How long is it supposed to last?

11
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:43.368
- Hey.
- The other day,


12
00:02:43.403 --> 00:02:46.008
I was trying to text
"patience is a virtue" to Nora,


13
00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:47.911
but because I still
can't type on my phone,


14
00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:49.979
it autocorrected
to "patience is a vulture."


15
00:02:50.014 --> 00:02:51.409
- Ha!
As far as expressions go,


16
00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:52.520
it's actually kind of great.

17
00:02:52.544 --> 00:02:53.818
- That's what I thought!

18
00:02:53.853 --> 00:02:55.688
So naturally,
I believed I invented the phrase


19
00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:58.350
and started having fantasies
of making t-shirts,


20
00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:00.198
debating whether or not
to put the vulture on it


21
00:03:00.222 --> 00:03:01.485
or just go with the expression.

22
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.871
- Would you do
the drawing yourself?


23
00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:04.664
- No, I don't think so.
Why?


24
00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.644
- Well, you've always had
an overinflated opinion about


25
00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:07.700
your drawing ability.

26
00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:09.933
- I was planning on handwriting,

27
00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:12.008
and we can both agree
I have pretty cool penmanship.


28
00:03:12.036 --> 00:03:13.717
- You're aware that even
bragging about penmanship


29
00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:15.532
is ridiculous?
- Statement of fact.


30
00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:18.040
- Not really!

31
00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:21.076
- Anyway, I searched
"patience is a vulture."


32
00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:23.650
Turns out it's already out there
on multiple platforms.


33
00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:25.817
- How's the writing going?
- Terrible.


34
00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:27.621
Do you think I've peaked?

35
00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:30.283
That I'm already on the downside
of a largely forgettable career?


36
00:03:30.318 --> 00:03:31.625
- Seriously, I think

37
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.254
I might have ADD because even

38
00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.158
finishing a single paragraph
feels Sisyphean.


39
00:03:37.193 --> 00:03:39.556
My last book sold 896 copies.

40
00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:41.668
I've long since spent
the advance for this one.


41
00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:44.836
- I see you haven't
lost your flair for melodrama.


42
00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.713
- Elf, are you alright?

43
00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:01.655
- Yeah.

44
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.250
Yeah, I'm fine.

45
00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:05.252
You don't have
to worry about me.


46
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.452
- I'm not worried, actually.

47
00:04:07.487 --> 00:04:09.388
- I'm at the hall.
I have to go.


48
00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:11.929
Bye.

49
00:05:51.426 --> 00:05:54.900
In a tiny Mennonite
village in Siberia in 1917,


50
00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:56.693
the year of
the Bolshevik Revolution,


51
00:05:56.728 --> 00:05:58.970
while his parents were
being murdered in a field


52
00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:01.368
beside their barn,
my grandfather survived


53
00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.634
by burying himself
in a pile of manure.


54
00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.422
- Fuck you.

55
00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:30.903
Suffering is
something that is passed on


56
00:06:30.938 --> 00:06:33.004
from one generation to the next,

57
00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.369
like flexibility, grace,

58
00:06:35.404 --> 00:06:37.943
or colourblindness.

59
00:06:44.248 --> 00:06:45.643
- Mom?

60
00:06:52.487 --> 00:06:54.124
Working again?

61
00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.786
- I just lay down.

62
00:06:56.821 --> 00:06:59.195
It's part of my process.

63
00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:04.068
Yes?

64
00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:05.696
- Dad just texted me.

65
00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:07.731
He wants me to tell you
to sign the divorce papers


66
00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:09.601
before he gets back
from Borneo, and...


67
00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:12.604
that you should have
signed them weeks ago.


68
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.639
I mean, you do realize
it's emotionally damaging


69
00:07:14.674 --> 00:07:17.950
to put me in the middle
of your divorce, right?


70
00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:19.611
- If we were getting divorced,

71
00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:20.997
then we wouldn't
have been married,


72
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:22.922
and if we weren't married,
or at least together,


73
00:07:22.957 --> 00:07:24.286
you wouldn't have been born.

74
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:27.586
So my guess, whatever
angst you're experiencing


75
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:32.195
has to be preferable
to non-existence.


76
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.625
- Today?

77
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.199
- Whose side are you on?

78
00:07:36.234 --> 00:07:37.838
- Mine.

79
00:09:00.813 --> 00:09:03.022
- Thank you.

80
00:09:03.057 --> 00:09:06.685
- Yeah, you too.

81
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.258
- What are you thinking?

82
00:09:08.293 --> 00:09:10.227
- No, nothing.

83
00:09:10.262 --> 00:09:12.999
- No, something's bugging you.

84
00:09:13.034 --> 00:09:15.199
- Uh...

85
00:09:15.234 --> 00:09:17.861
Who says "Thank you" after sex?

86
00:09:17.896 --> 00:09:20.897
- Why did you fold your clothes?

87
00:09:20.932 --> 00:09:23.240
- What?
- Before sex.


88
00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:27.079
I can't imagine
folding my clothes.


89
00:09:27.114 --> 00:09:30.049
- You were in the bathroom.

90
00:09:30.084 --> 00:09:34.515
I already spend too much
on dry cleaning, so...


91
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.583
Fuck, why am I defending myself?

92
00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.453
- You shouldn't.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


93
00:09:38.488 --> 00:09:41.885
I'm an idiot for bringing
it up in the first place.


94
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.791
Sorry.

95
00:09:46.826 --> 00:09:49.035
- Hey, Mom.

96
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.763
- Yoli?

97
00:09:51.798 --> 00:09:53.501
Your sister...

98
00:09:56.902 --> 00:09:58.671
she tried to kill herself.

99
00:10:26.338 --> 00:10:27.678
- Is it
too late to tell the elders


100
00:10:27.702 --> 00:10:31.770
that selling was a mistake?

101
00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:34.146
That we want to move back in?

102
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.748
Or that they unfairly
pressured you into selling?


103
00:10:42.783 --> 00:10:46.653
- Pastor Behr needed the space.

104
00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:49.524
There was no room
in his house for an addition.


105
00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:51.526
We should never
have come back here.


106
00:10:51.561 --> 00:10:53.990
This is their home now.

107
00:10:54.025 --> 00:10:56.432
- But you built this yourself.

108
00:10:56.467 --> 00:10:58.896
- That was a long time ago.

109
00:11:21.393 --> 00:11:22.524
DR.
- Hi.

110
00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:24.163
Hi, I'm Dr. Johns,

111
00:11:24.198 --> 00:11:27.232
the psychiatrist
here at the hospital.


112
00:11:27.267 --> 00:11:29.025
I've heard you play before.

113
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.335
It was...
It was beautiful.


114
00:11:35.605 --> 00:11:36.868
Don't forget, I...

115
00:11:36.903 --> 00:11:39.574
I want to help.

116
00:11:39.609 --> 00:11:41.378
I'm here to listen.

117
00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:58.021
You were here
almost a decade ago.


118
00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:03.763
And I see you've been prescribed
valproate and cariprazine.


119
00:12:03.798 --> 00:12:05.633
Have you been taking them?

120
00:12:10.574 --> 00:12:14.103
Elfrieda, I need you to engage.

121
00:12:14.138 --> 00:12:16.149
Please, just...

122
00:12:16.184 --> 00:12:17.447
just look at me.

123
00:12:24.456 --> 00:12:28.755
Alright, I will come back
and try again later.


124
00:13:02.527 --> 00:13:05.627
- Oh, come on!

125
00:13:05.662 --> 00:13:09.092
Have you seen my phone?
- Uh, no.


126
00:13:09.127 --> 00:13:10.643
- Are you gonna be okay
while I'm gone?


127
00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:12.062
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, honest.


128
00:13:12.097 --> 00:13:13.866
And Rachel
is staying over tonight.


129
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:16.572
- Okay, no boyfriends in
the house while I'm gone, okay?


130
00:13:16.607 --> 00:13:19.806
- Well, there is only one,
singular, and he has a name.


131
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.170
- Yes, he does.
- Mm-hm!


132
00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:22.941
What is it?

133
00:13:22.976 --> 00:13:26.978
- Right now, we're doing this?

134
00:13:27.013 --> 00:13:29.178
Anders.
His name is Anders.


135
00:13:29.213 --> 00:13:32.720
- When will you be back?

136
00:13:32.755 --> 00:13:34.590
- I don't know.

137
00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:36.955
- Then I am not gonna
promise not to have him over!


138
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.561
- God, come on, 
Nora, you're 16!

139
00:13:38.596 --> 00:13:40.277
- Okay, Mom, no,
if I wanna have sex with him,


140
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:41.696
I am gonna have sex with him

141
00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:43.203
regardless of whether
it's in this house or not,


142
00:13:43.227 --> 00:13:44.677
so what does my age
have to do with it?


143
00:13:44.701 --> 00:13:45.711
- But who said
anything about sex?


144
00:13:45.735 --> 00:13:47.009
Are you having sex
with this person?


145
00:13:47.033 --> 00:13:48.384
- That's absolutely
none of your business,


146
00:13:48.408 --> 00:13:50.199
and I don't think you're
in the best position


147
00:13:50.234 --> 00:13:52.245
to be giving relationship
advice right now.


148
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.347
- Yeah.
Yes, of course not.


149
00:13:55.382 --> 00:13:56.689
- Well, now you're
being passive-aggressive.


150
00:13:56.713 --> 00:13:58.845
- No, no, honest, I'm not.
I'm not.


151
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.046
I just, I have to go
or I will miss my plane.


152
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:05.082
- Say hi to Elf for me,
and tell her I love her.


153
00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:08.492
- I will.

154
00:14:08.527 --> 00:14:09.889
I'll call you from the airport.

155
00:14:09.924 --> 00:14:12.826
- Okay.

156
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:14.894
- I love you.
- Love you too.


157
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.189
- Actually,
before we get to the hospital,


158
00:14:46.224 --> 00:14:49.698
can we stop at 304 Brightside,
please?


159
00:14:49.733 --> 00:14:52.228
- Yeah, you got it.
- Thanks.


160
00:15:44.183 --> 00:15:46.590
- So, we have heard
that Elfrieda has expressed


161
00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:49.186
an indiscreet desire
to leave the community


162
00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:51.628
and to eventually
go to university.


163
00:15:51.663 --> 00:15:53.531
To study music.

164
00:15:57.196 --> 00:16:00.967
- She's only 15.
If she goes, she'll get ideas.


165
00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:03.673
- Well, that's what
university is for, isn't it?


166
00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:05.609
- Please,
cleverness doesn't suit you.


167
00:16:07.811 --> 00:16:09.646
- Chuck you, Farley!

168
00:16:09.681 --> 00:16:11.978
- We have had
problems with Elfrieda before,


169
00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:14.387
but if she leaves,

170
00:16:14.422 --> 00:16:17.346
she may be lost to us forever.

171
00:16:31.197 --> 00:16:33.967
- Can you please
tell your daughter to stop?


172
00:16:44.342 --> 00:16:46.177
- Elf, please stop.

173
00:18:02.288 --> 00:18:04.090
- We have to stop
meeting like this.


174
00:18:12.496 --> 00:18:13.803
- It'd be nice.

175
00:18:24.618 --> 00:18:26.849
- I overheard
a great line last night.


176
00:18:26.884 --> 00:18:29.555
- Yeah?

177
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.755
What was it?

178
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.121
- "Very much
amazed at what little


179
00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:37.827
"intelligence there is to
be found in Miss Von R."


180
00:18:37.862 --> 00:18:39.389
- They said that about you?
Who?


181
00:18:39.424 --> 00:18:41.358
- A nurse.
- Bitch.


182
00:18:41.393 --> 00:18:45.538
- I can only assume that
in her professional opinion,


183
00:18:45.573 --> 00:18:48.266
that 'cause I'm not grateful
for having my life saved,


184
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:50.906
I must be stupid.

185
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:54.305
- What about your doctor?

186
00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.341
- You know how they are, Yoli.

187
00:18:57.376 --> 00:19:02.181
Equating intelligence
with the desire to live.


188
00:19:02.216 --> 00:19:04.986
Or decency.

189
00:19:05.021 --> 00:19:06.317
- Or decency.

190
00:19:15.526 --> 00:19:19.033
Mom showed me your suicide note.

191
00:19:19.068 --> 00:19:20.738
Don't.

192
00:19:20.773 --> 00:19:22.806
- Well, if you didn't
want anyone to read it,


193
00:19:22.841 --> 00:19:24.137
you shouldn't have written one.

194
00:19:24.172 --> 00:19:28.471
More mysterious that way.

195
00:19:28.506 --> 00:19:31.716
Thank you for putting me on it.

196
00:19:31.751 --> 00:19:34.851
Yeah, you're welcome.

197
00:19:37.053 --> 00:19:39.988
- Can we talk
about my placement?


198
00:19:40.023 --> 00:19:42.023
I was, like,
two-thirds down the list.


199
00:19:42.058 --> 00:19:43.992
It feels...

200
00:19:44.027 --> 00:19:46.027
feels like I was
an afterthought, hmm?


201
00:19:50.264 --> 00:19:51.967
- I just didn't want it
to go to your head.


202
00:19:52.002 --> 00:19:54.035
- Yeah, no, of course not.

203
00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:03.374
- I wanted...

204
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:05.013
want...

205
00:20:05.048 --> 00:20:07.983
to die.

206
00:20:08.018 --> 00:20:09.380
This wasn't a mistake.

207
00:20:09.415 --> 00:20:10.755
- No.

208
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.252
No, none of this strikes me
as a cry for help.


209
00:20:13.287 --> 00:20:16.156
There are people
who want you to live,


210
00:20:16.191 --> 00:20:20.028
so it would seem then that
you have enemies who love you.


211
00:20:20.063 --> 00:20:22.261
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.


212
00:20:35.606 --> 00:20:37.012
I'm sorry.

213
00:20:37.047 --> 00:20:40.213
- Oh, don't apologize.

214
00:20:40.248 --> 00:20:43.854
Apologies are not the bedrock
of civilized society.


215
00:20:43.889 --> 00:20:45.053
- Now, remind me,

216
00:20:45.088 --> 00:20:48.419
what is the bedrock
of civilized society?


217
00:20:48.454 --> 00:20:51.422
- Libraries.
- Hmm, yeah.


218
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.899
Read any good books lately?

219
00:20:55.934 --> 00:20:57.461
- No.

220
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.510
Can you leave me alone?

221
00:21:15.855 --> 00:21:16.855
- Yeah.

222
00:21:23.522 --> 00:21:25.621
Well, I'll be back tomorrow.

223
00:21:51.957 --> 00:21:54.452
- Hmm?

224
00:22:03.232 --> 00:22:05.870
Sometimes we have
to be brave, Yoli.


225
00:22:05.905 --> 00:22:10.303
That's it.

226
00:22:10.338 --> 00:22:14.208
- How brave, exactly?

227
00:22:14.243 --> 00:22:18.850
- As brave as
Alexander Solzhenitsyn.


228
00:22:18.885 --> 00:22:22.051
As brave as
Alexander Solzhenitsyn.


229
00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:38.562
- When I found her,
there was blood everywhere.


230
00:22:38.597 --> 00:22:42.203
I thought she was dead.

231
00:22:42.238 --> 00:22:44.568
I never saw the note till
I went back to the house


232
00:22:44.603 --> 00:22:47.010
to try and clean up.

233
00:22:47.045 --> 00:22:50.211
You saw what she wrote:

234
00:22:50.246 --> 00:22:52.543
"Please let me go.
DNR."


235
00:22:57.616 --> 00:22:59.583
- Would you have
done anything differently?


236
00:22:59.618 --> 00:23:02.157
- No.

237
00:23:02.192 --> 00:23:03.554
Of course not.

238
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:09.934
At the hospital in her delirium,

239
00:23:09.969 --> 00:23:14.565
she asked me if I'd
Thomas Aquinas her.


240
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.600
Later I decided
she must have meant


241
00:23:16.635 --> 00:23:18.976
will I forgive her?

242
00:23:21.244 --> 00:23:22.375
- And will you?

243
00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.179
- She doesn't need forgiving.

244
00:23:24.214 --> 00:23:27.380
It's not a sin.

245
00:23:27.415 --> 00:23:29.712
And she'd never admit it,
but she blames me.


246
00:23:29.747 --> 00:23:31.318
- No, Mom, she doesn't.

247
00:23:31.353 --> 00:23:33.353
- I'd blame me.

248
00:23:33.388 --> 00:23:37.159
Want to know the truth?
I was checking up on her.


249
00:23:37.194 --> 00:23:38.721
I wasn't supposed to be there.

250
00:23:38.756 --> 00:23:41.625
She told me she didn't
want to be disturbed,


251
00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.969
she was practising,

252
00:23:45.004 --> 00:23:46.938
and I violated that request.

253
00:23:53.573 --> 00:23:55.914
All we can do now is wait...

254
00:23:55.949 --> 00:23:58.642
But wait for what?

255
00:23:59.711 --> 00:24:01.821
We're supposed
to help each other.


256
00:24:31.347 --> 00:24:32.984
- Sit.
I'll make some breakfast.


257
00:24:33.019 --> 00:24:34.887
- No, thanks, Aunt Tina.
I'm not hungry.


258
00:24:34.922 --> 00:24:37.846
- No, you have to eat.

259
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:40.255
It's what we do.

260
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:42.323
- Sure.

261
00:24:42.358 --> 00:24:44.028
Hmm.

262
00:24:48.969 --> 00:24:50.529
- She planned it well.

263
00:24:50.564 --> 00:24:52.905
- 'Ish.'
I mean, I beg to differ.


264
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.368
After all, she's still alive.

265
00:24:54.403 --> 00:24:56.865
- Yes, not like your father.

266
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.504
Or my Lenny.

267
00:24:58.539 --> 00:25:00.275
- No, they were experts.

268
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.475
No warnings, no signs.

269
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.213
- They had us all fooled.

270
00:25:08.252 --> 00:25:10.054
I don't know what to do.

271
00:25:10.089 --> 00:25:11.682
- Oh...

272
00:25:14.918 --> 00:25:18.029
You know, our family
was once big enough


273
00:25:18.064 --> 00:25:21.395
to field two baseball teams.

274
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.596
Your mother and I buried

275
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.043
Schlop scheen.

276
00:25:35.345 --> 00:25:38.412
- Schlop scheen.

277
00:26:00.898 --> 00:26:04.801
I should have seen the signs.

278
00:26:04.836 --> 00:26:08.409
She's my wife.

279
00:26:08.444 --> 00:26:10.312
I keep beating myself up
for going into work


280
00:26:10.347 --> 00:26:13.183
instead of staying home.
- No.


281
00:26:13.218 --> 00:26:16.384
No, she's really good.

282
00:26:16.419 --> 00:26:18.254
Does Claudio know?

283
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:19.618
- Not yet.

284
00:26:19.653 --> 00:26:20.993
He's left messages.

285
00:26:21.028 --> 00:26:22.885
- You should let him know.

286
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.823
At least that she might not
be able to get back on the road.


287
00:26:26.858 --> 00:26:30.596
Give him a chance to cancel
the dates or find a replacement.


288
00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:33.632
- I just worry
that without the tour,


289
00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:37.768
she won't have
anything to live for.


290
00:26:37.803 --> 00:26:40.606
- But we already know
it wasn't enough, right?


291
00:27:05.105 --> 00:27:08.271
- What are you reading?

292
00:27:08.306 --> 00:27:11.934
- My novel.

293
00:27:11.969 --> 00:27:15.443
- Another radio story?

294
00:27:15.478 --> 00:27:17.181
- No, this is the "book" book.

295
00:27:17.216 --> 00:27:18.644
The real book.

296
00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:20.481
Did you know that Mom
played the word "vulva"


297
00:27:20.516 --> 00:27:21.878
at the Scrabble club
the other day?


298
00:27:21.913 --> 00:27:23.418
- Is it done?

299
00:27:23.453 --> 00:27:25.101
- She said that the guy
she was playing with,


300
00:27:25.125 --> 00:27:27.301
who was much younger, couldn't
look her in the eye after.


301
00:27:27.325 --> 00:27:28.522
- Is it finished?

302
00:27:28.557 --> 00:27:31.558
I don't want to talk about it.

303
00:27:31.593 --> 00:27:35.100
- Hmm.
Well, it looks finished.


304
00:27:35.135 --> 00:27:36.178
You want to read me
a little bit?


305
00:27:36.202 --> 00:27:37.861
- No.

306
00:27:37.896 --> 00:27:39.698
- Come on, swift.

307
00:27:39.733 --> 00:27:41.238
Read me a page!

308
00:27:41.273 --> 00:27:43.207
- No.
- Okay, a paragraph?


309
00:27:43.242 --> 00:27:44.901
- No.
- A sentence?


310
00:27:44.936 --> 00:27:46.144
- No!
- Word?


311
00:27:46.179 --> 00:27:47.376
- Okay.
Alright.


312
00:27:47.411 --> 00:27:50.346
I will read you the first
letter of my novel.


313
00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.010
Yeah.

314
00:27:55.045 --> 00:27:56.045
- Okay.

315
00:27:57.751 --> 00:27:59.355
"L."

316
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.690
- Mmm...
it's brilliant.


317
00:28:07.596 --> 00:28:09.508
I think it might be the best
thing you've ever written.


318
00:28:09.532 --> 00:28:10.993
- Really?
- Really.


319
00:28:11.028 --> 00:28:12.467
- Thank you so much!

320
00:28:12.502 --> 00:28:14.601
That means so much to me.

321
00:28:19.069 --> 00:28:20.904
- What's your book about?

322
00:29:03.047 --> 00:29:06.224
- I'm gonna go get a coffee.

323
00:29:11.363 --> 00:29:13.957

drift apart at the same rate


324
00:29:13.992 --> 00:29:17.026
as fingernails grow.

325
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.737
Or is it the other way around?

326
00:29:24.772 --> 00:29:28.477
I forget.

327
00:29:46.024 --> 00:29:47.826
- What's in the bag?

328
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:49.861
- My novel.

329
00:29:52.701 --> 00:29:55.339
- Elf says
the first letter is great,


330
00:29:55.374 --> 00:29:58.309
but that you're being very
secretive about other details.


331
00:29:58.344 --> 00:30:01.741
- It's I...
I just didn't...


332
00:30:01.776 --> 00:30:05.349
I just didn't feel like
talking about it with her.


333
00:30:05.384 --> 00:30:07.318
- How many words do you have?

334
00:30:07.353 --> 00:30:09.683
- I haven't counted.
- And will it be sad?


335
00:30:09.718 --> 00:30:11.520
Because there hasn't
been a book of yours


336
00:30:11.555 --> 00:30:16.052
that I finished reading
and haven't felt like crying.


337
00:30:16.087 --> 00:30:20.232
You carry a lot of sadness,
and for that I am sorry.


338
00:30:26.768 --> 00:30:29.274
I wanted to tell
my mother that when I was a kid,


339
00:30:29.309 --> 00:30:32.310
I woke up every morning singing,

340
00:30:32.345 --> 00:30:36.072
that there was no freer soul
in the world than me at six.


341
00:30:38.978 --> 00:30:42.320
- You are not to blame.

342
00:30:42.355 --> 00:30:44.179
I'm not like her.

343
00:30:44.214 --> 00:30:46.082
I'm not like Dad.

344
00:30:49.428 --> 00:30:51.054
- No, me neither.

345
00:30:57.601 --> 00:31:00.536
- Oh, shit.

346
00:31:07.237 --> 00:31:10.744
- It appears
as though the car is dead.


347
00:31:10.779 --> 00:31:13.208
- Oh, boy.

348
00:31:13.243 --> 00:31:16.849
The metaphors seem to be
popping up all over the place!


349
00:31:16.884 --> 00:31:19.214
- Mom!
- Sorry.


350
00:31:19.249 --> 00:31:21.051
- Ah, thank God
the rest of our lives


351
00:31:21.086 --> 00:31:22.624
are going so well, otherwise...

352
00:31:22.659 --> 00:31:23.988
I don't know how we'd cope.

353
00:31:24.023 --> 00:31:25.792
- So...?

354
00:31:27.763 --> 00:31:29.191
- Uh...

355
00:31:29.226 --> 00:31:30.929
Well, we're not
that far from home.


356
00:31:30.964 --> 00:31:32.535
Should we walk?

357
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.230
- Yeah.
Yeah, I need the exercise.


358
00:31:35.265 --> 00:31:39.641
And I haven't had a bowel
movement in three days.


359
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:54.722
- Where have you been?

360
00:31:54.757 --> 00:31:56.262
I've been trying to get in touch
with you since yesterday.


361
00:31:56.286 --> 00:31:58.726
- Yeah.
Look, there's some sort of...


362
00:31:58.761 --> 00:32:00.926
I don't know, like,
accountant-looking guy who says


363
00:32:00.961 --> 00:32:02.697
that you sent him
here to check on me?


364
00:32:02.732 --> 00:32:04.270
- That's Finbar.
He's actually a lawyer.


365
00:32:04.294 --> 00:32:05.502
Yes, I did.

366
00:32:05.537 --> 00:32:07.097
- Who is he?

367
00:32:07.132 --> 00:32:09.297
- Well, why haven't you
been answering your phone?


368
00:32:09.332 --> 00:32:10.903
- I lost it.
Look, please don't tell me


369
00:32:10.938 --> 00:32:12.069
you're dating this guy.

370
00:32:12.104 --> 00:32:13.444
- How did you lose your phone?

371
00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:15.050
- I don't know.
I keep hoping it'll reappear.


372
00:32:15.074 --> 00:32:17.415
So you're dating him?
- No, we're friends.


373
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:19.549
Will you pass him
the phone for me?


374
00:32:19.584 --> 00:32:21.749
- He seems creepy.

375
00:32:21.784 --> 00:32:23.179
- Pass him the phone.

376
00:32:35.358 --> 00:32:37.831
- Congratulations on
your upgrade to the psych ward.


377
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:46.037
- Tell me something, Elf.

378
00:32:46.072 --> 00:32:47.676
Anything.

379
00:32:53.376 --> 00:32:55.486
- You still seeing
that violin player?


380
00:32:55.521 --> 00:32:57.785
- No.

381
00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.721
Kind of.

382
00:32:59.756 --> 00:33:02.757
- What about that lawyer?
What's his name, Alex?


383
00:33:02.792 --> 00:33:05.628
- Finbar.

384
00:33:05.663 --> 00:33:08.026
- Finbar...

385
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:09.632
- Are you dating?

386
00:33:09.667 --> 00:33:11.359
- Oh, I don't know what it is...

387
00:33:11.394 --> 00:33:14.505
or how to define it.

388
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.672
Ending 16 years
of monogamy with Dan


389
00:33:16.707 --> 00:33:18.971
has triggered some kind of...

390
00:33:19.006 --> 00:33:22.546
I don't know, like,
weird animal reaction.


391
00:33:24.374 --> 00:33:26.077
To be honest,
the past few months


392
00:33:26.112 --> 00:33:28.552
have not been my proudest.

393
00:33:28.587 --> 00:33:32.248
I might be a slut now.

394
00:33:32.283 --> 00:33:34.888
- Are you using protection?

395
00:33:34.923 --> 00:33:37.858
- Would that make a difference?

396
00:33:37.893 --> 00:33:39.893
If I got pregnant, would...

397
00:33:39.928 --> 00:33:42.401
would that give you something
to look forward to?


398
00:33:51.104 --> 00:33:53.005
What are we doing here, Elf?

399
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.810
- Talking.
- You know what I mean.


400
00:33:58.375 --> 00:34:00.419
Do you have any desire
to rejoin the world?


401
00:34:07.494 --> 00:34:10.022
And are you thinking at all
of the reasons to stay alive?


402
00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:20.648
How was your visit
with Nic last night?


403
00:34:20.672 --> 00:34:21.902
How's he doing?

404
00:34:21.937 --> 00:34:23.035
- Stop it.

405
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.476
- It must be terrible for him.

406
00:34:24.511 --> 00:34:26.104
- Stop!
- Have you, um,


407
00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:28.612
showered, eaten breakfast,
checked your phone,


408
00:34:28.647 --> 00:34:30.383
taken your meds,
talked to your psychiatrist?


409
00:34:30.407 --> 00:34:32.451
- Don't interrogate me.

410
00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:58.136
- The other day,
I was walking down this alley


411
00:34:58.171 --> 00:35:01.106
and there was an old man

412
00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:03.944
trying to erase

413
00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:07.112
some graffiti from
the top of this wall.


414
00:35:07.147 --> 00:35:08.949
He was standing
on a really low stool,


415
00:35:08.984 --> 00:35:10.412
like a foot off the ground,
tops,


416
00:35:10.447 --> 00:35:13.085
and his wife was
holding on to his hips


417
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.693
so he wouldn't fall.

418
00:35:16.728 --> 00:35:18.662
And they were so old

419
00:35:18.697 --> 00:35:22.490
and so concerned for each other
it made me want to cry.


420
00:35:25.803 --> 00:35:28.771
- Have you embedded some
type of parable into this story,


421
00:35:28.806 --> 00:35:31.004
something you'll
hope I'll take away?


422
00:35:31.039 --> 00:35:33.105
- You mean like
something about not giving up?


423
00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.173
- Yeah.
- No.


424
00:35:35.208 --> 00:35:37.109
In fact, the lesson
one could take away


425
00:35:37.144 --> 00:35:38.616
from this particular anecdote

426
00:35:38.651 --> 00:35:41.146
is to stop risking your life
to maintain a clean wall.


427
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.697
- Will you take me
to Switzerland?


428
00:35:53.732 --> 00:35:55.699
- Yes.

429
00:35:55.734 --> 00:35:59.131
Yeah, we could get Swatches.

430
00:35:59.166 --> 00:36:01.408
- Is that what you think of
when you think of Switzerland?


431
00:36:01.432 --> 00:36:03.168
- Mm-hm.
That and yodelling.


432
00:36:03.203 --> 00:36:04.873
And perfectly organized closets.

433
00:36:04.908 --> 00:36:07.084
It feels like there's nothing
out of place in that country.


434
00:36:07.108 --> 00:36:11.077
- They have clinics there
where dying is legal,


435
00:36:11.112 --> 00:36:13.376
where you don't
have to die alone.


436
00:36:17.316 --> 00:36:19.184
- Why are these here?

437
00:36:24.257 --> 00:36:26.796
- I was having coffee
with a young mother.


438
00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:29.557
She's going through a rough
patch and she asked me


439
00:36:29.592 --> 00:36:32.197
if I would keep them so she
wouldn't be tempted to fire them


440
00:36:32.232 --> 00:36:33.836
into her head.

441
00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:37.400
- How could she fire
two bullets into her own head?


442
00:36:37.435 --> 00:36:39.842
- The other one
was for her daughter


443
00:36:39.877 --> 00:36:44.011
so she wouldn't be
leaving her alone.


444
00:36:44.046 --> 00:36:47.179
- No.

445
00:36:47.214 --> 00:36:50.149
No, Elf, I will not
take you to Switzerland.


446
00:36:50.184 --> 00:36:51.854
- I'm asking you
to do this for me, Yoli.


447
00:36:51.889 --> 00:36:53.515
- No.

448
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.890
- I have a terminal illness.

449
00:36:54.925 --> 00:36:57.453
- You don't.
You don't.


450
00:36:57.488 --> 00:37:00.225
No, you're asking me to take
you to Switzerland to be killed.


451
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.964
Are you out of
your fucking mind?


452
00:37:10.809 --> 00:37:12.875
Do you have any idea
how much I would miss you?


453
00:37:42.808 --> 00:37:47.041
You're not a slut.

454
00:37:47.076 --> 00:37:48.845
Didn't I teach you anything?

455
00:38:07.998 --> 00:38:11.032
- You're Elf's
psychiatrist, right?


456
00:38:11.067 --> 00:38:13.430
DR.
- Who?

457
00:38:13.465 --> 00:38:16.301
- Elfrieda Von Riesen,
my sister.


458
00:38:16.336 --> 00:38:18.468
Uh, I've seen you
around the hospital.


459
00:38:18.503 --> 00:38:19.755
Have you talked with her lately?

460
00:38:19.779 --> 00:38:20.943
DR.
- I've tried.

461
00:38:20.978 --> 00:38:22.780
The nurses say
she won't take her meds.


462
00:38:22.815 --> 00:38:24.507
- Yeah, she's funny that way.

463
00:38:24.542 --> 00:38:26.256
You must have seen
this kind of thing before.


464
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.181
I mean, she's a psych patient...

465
00:38:28.216 --> 00:38:31.481
Chances are she's bound to have
a few eccentricities, right?


466
00:38:31.516 --> 00:38:33.120
DR.- Unless
she's willing to talk to me,


467
00:38:33.155 --> 00:38:35.089
there's absolutely
nothing I can do.


468
00:38:35.124 --> 00:38:37.157
- So that's it?
You're just giving up?


469
00:38:37.192 --> 00:38:38.862
DR.
- No, not at all,

470
00:38:38.897 --> 00:38:43.526
but it's essential
that she take the first steps.


471
00:38:43.561 --> 00:38:46.265
- She's begging for help
but she wants to assert


472
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.301
one tiny vestige of individual
power over her life.


473
00:38:49.336 --> 00:38:51.303
Where's the harm in that?

474
00:38:51.338 --> 00:38:52.975
DR.
- There isn't,

475
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:54.911
but it's a much
more complex dynamic


476
00:38:54.946 --> 00:38:58.244
than you might have learned
about in first-year psych.


477
00:38:58.279 --> 00:38:59.608
- She...

478
00:38:59.643 --> 00:39:01.643
she's obviously in pain.

479
00:39:01.678 --> 00:39:04.217
When do you apply all of your
training and your compassion


480
00:39:04.252 --> 00:39:05.482
to trying to fix her?

481
00:39:05.517 --> 00:39:07.550
Like, if you can't help her,
then who can?


482
00:39:07.585 --> 00:39:08.903
DR.- You're not
the first family member


483
00:39:08.927 --> 00:39:11.026
to take out their
frustrations on me.


484
00:39:11.061 --> 00:39:12.764
I'm sorry.

485
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.660
- Sorry.

486
00:39:20.664 --> 00:39:21.664
Sorry.

487
00:40:05.214 --> 00:40:07.610
- Hello, Elfrieda.

488
00:40:07.645 --> 00:40:09.678
The community heard
that you were in the hospital


489
00:40:09.713 --> 00:40:12.054
and suffering deeply.

490
00:40:12.089 --> 00:40:14.089
Well, I'm here to let you know

491
00:40:14.124 --> 00:40:16.355
that when you
give yourself to God,


492
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:18.522
you don't feel pain anymore.

493
00:40:24.629 --> 00:40:29.236
Shall we pray
together for your soul?


494
00:40:29.271 --> 00:40:31.469
- What?
Holy fuck!


495
00:40:31.504 --> 00:40:33.570
I hope she told him
to go fuck himself.


496
00:40:33.605 --> 00:40:35.077
Also, where were the nurses?

497
00:40:35.112 --> 00:40:37.112
I'm not allowed to
talk on my cell phone,


498
00:40:37.147 --> 00:40:39.114
but they're just
letting strangers into


499
00:40:39.149 --> 00:40:41.127
the rooms of their patients?
What is wrong with them?


500
00:40:41.151 --> 00:40:42.612
- Ugh.
I wanted to kill him.


501
00:40:42.647 --> 00:40:44.955
- I hope she...
Seriously, she should have


502
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:46.583
strangled him
with her underwear.


503
00:40:46.618 --> 00:40:49.784
- They don't let patients
on suicide watch wear underwear.


504
00:40:49.819 --> 00:40:51.456
- Really?
- No, they don't.


505
00:40:51.491 --> 00:40:55.262
- Huh.

506
00:40:55.297 --> 00:40:57.000
- What are days for?

507
00:40:57.035 --> 00:40:58.661
- What's that supposed to mean?

508
00:40:58.696 --> 00:41:00.795
- Days are where we live.

509
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.335
- What?
What was she talking about?


510
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:04.942
- That was
the poem she was reciting,


511
00:41:04.977 --> 00:41:08.737
Philip Larkin's "Days."

512
00:41:08.772 --> 00:41:12.246
- They come, they wake us,
time and time over.


513
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:14.479
- They are to be happy in.

514
00:41:14.514 --> 00:41:17.284
- Where can we live but days?

515
00:41:17.319 --> 00:41:18.714
- I like that.
- That's the setup.


516
00:41:18.749 --> 00:41:20.617
There's a second verse.

517
00:41:20.652 --> 00:41:25.655
- Ah, solving that question

518
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:29.197
brings the priest and the doctor

519
00:41:29.232 --> 00:41:32.266
and their long coats

520
00:41:32.301 --> 00:41:35.874
running over the fields.

521
00:41:38.835 --> 00:41:43.013
- He left pretty quickly
after the clothes came off.


522
00:41:43.048 --> 00:41:46.478
That's fucking amazing.

523
00:41:46.513 --> 00:41:49.184
I mean, a striptease
to a Larkin poem?


524
00:41:49.219 --> 00:41:50.922
It's brilliant.

525
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.520
Maybe it's a sign.

526
00:41:56.721 --> 00:41:58.391
A turning point.

527
00:41:58.426 --> 00:42:02.296
That she gives enough of a fuck
to piss someone off, you know?


528
00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:04.529
Or to get out of bed.

529
00:42:04.564 --> 00:42:05.695
- Maybe.

530
00:42:14.838 --> 00:42:17.509
- Do you regret having kids?

531
00:42:17.544 --> 00:42:21.018
- What?
Why would you say that?


532
00:42:21.053 --> 00:42:22.877
- I don't know.
Just wondering.


533
00:42:26.652 --> 00:42:29.026
- Am I such a terrible
mother that I give you


534
00:42:29.061 --> 00:42:31.589
the impression that your birth
was a negative event in my life?


535
00:42:31.624 --> 00:42:34.559
- No, not really.

536
00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:39.564
I just wonder, and don't
take this the wrong way,


537
00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:41.863
you seem unhappy.

538
00:42:48.113 --> 00:42:50.146
- Do I seem unhappy to you?

539
00:42:54.119 --> 00:42:57.483
- Not any more
than the rest of us.


540
00:42:57.518 --> 00:43:01.223
- In comparison to me,
you and Mom just seem so...


541
00:43:01.258 --> 00:43:04.754
buoyant.

542
00:43:04.789 --> 00:43:06.229
Like people who
have a great capacity


543
00:43:06.263 --> 00:43:08.362
for dealing with things,

544
00:43:08.397 --> 00:43:11.563
for keeping
their heads above water.


545
00:43:15.404 --> 00:43:19.604
- When your father died,
he had $76 on him.


546
00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:22.640
Do you remember what
your mom did with that money?


547
00:43:22.675 --> 00:43:24.279
- No.

548
00:43:24.314 --> 00:43:28.052
- She used it
to get Thai takeout.


549
00:43:28.087 --> 00:43:30.087
I mean, what's the alternative?

550
00:43:30.122 --> 00:43:32.287
Keep the money and hope it will

551
00:43:32.322 --> 00:43:36.489
eventually reveal
some sort of answer?


552
00:43:36.524 --> 00:43:38.788
- The food wasn't that good,
if I remember correctly.


553
00:43:38.823 --> 00:43:41.560
- Or maybe it was
the best takeout ever,


554
00:43:41.595 --> 00:43:44.035
but to you...

555
00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:45.960
it still tasted like shit.

556
00:43:56.643 --> 00:43:58.775
- What's this?

557
00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.843
- It came in the mail
today for Elf.


558
00:44:03.188 --> 00:44:06.618
- It's very...
specific and thorough


559
00:44:06.653 --> 00:44:08.851
in explaining all the ways
to commit suicide.


560
00:44:08.886 --> 00:44:10.985
- She was able to order
this from her hospital bed?


561
00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.790
- No, before
she tried to kill herself.


562
00:44:13.825 --> 00:44:15.561
It was on back order.

563
00:44:15.596 --> 00:44:17.167
- You should throw it away.
- I can't.


564
00:44:17.202 --> 00:44:18.795
That's an invasion
of her privacy.


565
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.665
You can't just throw out
someone else's mail.


566
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.469
- Well, then hide it
in the back of a closet


567
00:44:22.504 --> 00:44:26.374
until she stops being suicidal.

568
00:44:26.409 --> 00:44:28.541
So, I was thinking.

569
00:44:28.576 --> 00:44:32.006
What if we did
something extreme with Elf?


570
00:44:32.041 --> 00:44:36.043
Like, we parachute her into
North Korea or Mogadishu,


571
00:44:36.078 --> 00:44:38.386
or, like, Baffin Island,

572
00:44:38.421 --> 00:44:40.531
and she's forced to survive
on her own like never before.


573
00:44:40.555 --> 00:44:42.852
Maybe it would jolt her
into a new notion


574
00:44:42.887 --> 00:44:44.051
of what it means to be alive.

575
00:44:44.086 --> 00:44:46.526
Like, her adrenal gland
would kickstart


576
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:49.056
a new life strategy
and then she'll realize


577
00:44:49.091 --> 00:44:52.202
that she doesn't
actually want to die.


578
00:44:52.237 --> 00:44:55.601
- Are you fucking serious?

579
00:44:55.636 --> 00:44:56.932
- I realize that the plan has

580
00:44:56.967 --> 00:44:58.868
a number of
logistical challenges.


581
00:44:58.903 --> 00:45:01.002
- Like a child soldier
killing her?


582
00:45:01.037 --> 00:45:03.213
Or the fact that
she doesn't parachute?


583
00:45:03.248 --> 00:45:05.512
- So, what?

584
00:45:05.547 --> 00:45:09.010
We wait, in the hope
that miraculously,


585
00:45:09.045 --> 00:45:10.847
pragmatism, psychiatry,

586
00:45:10.882 --> 00:45:13.355
and pharmaceuticals
will save the day?


587
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:15.621
- Doesn't she seem
to be getting better?


588
00:45:15.656 --> 00:45:17.018
- Based on what evidence?

589
00:45:17.053 --> 00:45:19.592
- She was asking
about Claudio, the tour.


590
00:45:19.627 --> 00:45:21.957
- She asked about the tour?
- Yes.


591
00:45:21.992 --> 00:45:24.300
- Without prompting?
- Yes.


592
00:45:38.811 --> 00:45:39.811
- Hello?

593
00:45:43.552 --> 00:45:45.717
- YVR.

594
00:45:45.752 --> 00:45:49.952
Your initials are the same
as the Vancouver Airport code.


595
00:45:49.987 --> 00:45:51.427
I thought it was you
when you called.


596
00:45:51.461 --> 00:45:53.956
I don't know too
many other Yolis.


597
00:45:53.991 --> 00:45:56.266
- It's good to see you again.

598
00:45:56.301 --> 00:45:59.632
So, how's my mother's car?

599
00:45:59.667 --> 00:46:03.537
- Yeah, that's a different
story altogether, isn't it?


600
00:46:03.572 --> 00:46:05.935
- It was a snapshot,

601
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.651
and then I realized
that in the last 15 years,


602
00:46:07.675 --> 00:46:09.939
I've morphed into
all these other selves.


603
00:46:09.974 --> 00:46:12.414
A soon-to-be-divorced woman
who left her husband


604
00:46:12.449 --> 00:46:16.044
for reasons that seemed
valid at the time.


605
00:46:16.079 --> 00:46:19.047
A grotesquely
undiscerning lover.


606
00:46:19.082 --> 00:46:21.720
A mother who's afraid her
parenting will be the cause


607
00:46:21.755 --> 00:46:24.822
of her child's
unhappiness, and...


608
00:46:24.857 --> 00:46:27.924
sitting in his truck,

609
00:46:27.959 --> 00:46:30.201
we were so... old.

610
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.601
- When I saw you,
all I could think about


611
00:46:34.636 --> 00:46:38.440
was our younger selves,
like how different I was at 21,


612
00:46:38.475 --> 00:46:42.246
how full of optimism,
expectations.


613
00:46:42.281 --> 00:46:44.006
And now, um...

614
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:45.579
- I know what you mean.

615
00:46:45.614 --> 00:46:49.979
I was punching way above my
weight even going to university.


616
00:46:50.014 --> 00:46:52.355
I mean,
never mind creative writing.


617
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:54.016
Oh my god.

618
00:46:54.051 --> 00:46:57.261
Yeah, I never graduated.

619
00:46:57.296 --> 00:46:58.790
- Any regrets?
- No.


620
00:46:58.825 --> 00:47:02.959
I mean, not about that.

621
00:47:02.994 --> 00:47:06.666
Did you know I had a nickname?

622
00:47:06.701 --> 00:47:08.338
- No, I don't remember that.

623
00:47:08.373 --> 00:47:09.735
Of course I knew.

624
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.473
I was the one
who gave it to him.


625
00:47:11.508 --> 00:47:13.277
- Yeah, Sad Jason.

626
00:47:13.312 --> 00:47:15.477
- Really?
Why?


627
00:47:15.512 --> 00:47:18.513
- The only reason
I even enrolled in university


628
00:47:18.548 --> 00:47:21.846
in the first place
is because I had this girlfriend


629
00:47:21.881 --> 00:47:24.453
in high school,
and I was very in love,


630
00:47:24.488 --> 00:47:26.851
and she broke up with me,

631
00:47:26.886 --> 00:47:30.888
and I just was wandering around,
you know, in a daze,


632
00:47:30.923 --> 00:47:35.398
couldn't concentrate,
so I became Sad Jason.


633
00:47:35.433 --> 00:47:40.700
I truly was the Eeyore
of undergraduates.


634
00:47:43.408 --> 00:47:47.069
- Yeah, well,
aside from the alliteration,


635
00:47:47.104 --> 00:47:51.744
there's irony
as history repeats itself.


636
00:47:51.779 --> 00:47:54.945
I am in the middle of a divorce.

637
00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:57.178
- You okay?
- Yeah.


638
00:47:57.213 --> 00:47:59.455
God, at least
we don't have kids.


639
00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:01.853
That would be awful.
- Yeah.


640
00:48:04.121 --> 00:48:05.121
Yeah.

641
00:48:09.467 --> 00:48:10.928
Have you ever been to Rotterdam?

642
00:48:14.131 --> 00:48:16.098
- Yeah!

643
00:48:16.133 --> 00:48:18.375
Good times.
You?


644
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:21.873
- No.

645
00:48:21.908 --> 00:48:24.238
I feel like I'm being weird.
I'm sorry.


646
00:48:24.273 --> 00:48:27.208
- That's how I remember you.

647
00:48:27.243 --> 00:48:31.179
- It's been really nice to talk.

648
00:48:31.214 --> 00:48:33.621
- Hmm.

649
00:48:33.656 --> 00:48:36.921
And so, I imagined we were...

650
00:48:36.956 --> 00:48:41.255
young and horny and very happy.

651
00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:42.960
Afterwards,
he wanted to know why


652
00:48:42.995 --> 00:48:45.468
I asked him about Rotterdam,
so I told him


653
00:48:45.503 --> 00:48:48.768
the premise of the book
I'm trying to write.


654
00:48:48.803 --> 00:48:51.540
- There's this harbourmaster
who ends up on a ship


655
00:48:51.575 --> 00:48:52.816
that he kind of shouldn't be on,

656
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.147
like he should
have gotten off it,


657
00:48:54.171 --> 00:48:55.907
but there's a storm,

658
00:48:55.942 --> 00:48:58.118
and so he can't get onto
his little boat to go back home,


659
00:48:58.142 --> 00:48:59.977
so he's stuck on this ship
going to Rotterdam,


660
00:49:00.012 --> 00:49:02.210
and then he misses this meeting.

661
00:49:02.245 --> 00:49:05.587
Like, everything
goes wrong for him.


662
00:49:05.622 --> 00:49:07.853
- Wouldn't he be able
to explain to her


663
00:49:07.888 --> 00:49:10.955
he's trapped
with technology now?


664
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:12.286
Text or whatever.

665
00:49:12.321 --> 00:49:15.432
- I know,
but for some reason he can't.


666
00:49:15.467 --> 00:49:17.071
I'm just... I'm having
structural problems.


667
00:49:17.095 --> 00:49:19.436
- Your structure is amazing.

668
00:49:19.471 --> 00:49:20.701
Please tell me he didn't say,

669
00:49:20.736 --> 00:49:22.296
"Your structure is amazing."

670
00:49:22.331 --> 00:49:24.100
- Those were his exact words.

671
00:49:24.135 --> 00:49:27.411
- Did you just
throw up all over him?


672
00:49:27.446 --> 00:49:28.841
- Yours too.

673
00:49:28.876 --> 00:49:31.173
- Oh, god!

674
00:49:31.208 --> 00:49:33.340
- I just think
the thing is about your book,


675
00:49:33.375 --> 00:49:35.980
it should move really fast.

676
00:49:36.015 --> 00:49:37.652
You know,
like pedal to the metal,


677
00:49:37.687 --> 00:49:39.984
so it doesn't get boring.
- Mm-hm.


678
00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:43.691
- Plus,
writing is so hard, right?


679
00:49:43.726 --> 00:49:46.793
You just want to get in there
and get the job done


680
00:49:46.828 --> 00:49:51.534
and get out,
like cleaning septic tanks.


681
00:49:51.569 --> 00:49:53.503
- Definitely.

682
00:49:53.538 --> 00:49:55.868
Elf, he compared writing

683
00:49:55.903 --> 00:49:58.035
to cleaning septic tanks.

684
00:49:58.070 --> 00:49:59.333
- Yeah.

685
00:49:59.368 --> 00:50:01.335
The more I thought about it,

686
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:03.678
the more the analogy
didn't seem so shitty.


687
00:50:03.713 --> 00:50:06.043
Oh, come on,
you go with the easiest


688
00:50:06.078 --> 00:50:08.485
and most obvious pun
and you call yourself a writer?


689
00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.685
- Stop it.
Stop it!


690
00:50:16.253 --> 00:50:19.826
- As I brought my fingers
to my nose to check


691
00:50:19.861 --> 00:50:23.698
if I reeked of motor oil or sex,

692
00:50:23.733 --> 00:50:27.999
I felt so ashamed.

693
00:50:28.034 --> 00:50:31.398
- Shame is so unnecessary.

694
00:50:31.433 --> 00:50:33.708
- Maybe.
Maybe not.


695
00:50:36.108 --> 00:50:41.045
Shame motivates us to say we're
sorry and to seek forgiveness.


696
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.816
It also motivates
some of us to write books


697
00:50:42.851 --> 00:50:45.687
as a futile attempt
at atonement.


698
00:50:45.722 --> 00:50:47.524
Shame helps
to fuck up relationships,


699
00:50:47.559 --> 00:50:50.725
and we all know fucked up
relationships are the lifeblood


700
00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.696
of books and movies and theatre.

701
00:50:54.731 --> 00:50:58.766
Get rid of shame
and you can kiss art goodbye.


702
00:50:58.801 --> 00:51:02.000
But I long for a life
without shame.


703
00:51:04.576 --> 00:51:06.444
- You look so defeated.

704
00:51:09.911 --> 00:51:12.208
- Tell me, Elf,
how should I look?


705
00:51:13.915 --> 00:51:16.553
- Well,
it was just an observation.


706
00:51:16.588 --> 00:51:18.753
- Hmm, it didn't sound like one.

707
00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.220
- Okay.

708
00:51:26.664 --> 00:51:29.896
Yoli...

709
00:51:29.931 --> 00:51:32.030
You gotta keep
your shit together.


710
00:51:32.065 --> 00:51:34.736
Especially for Mom.

711
00:51:34.771 --> 00:51:38.773
- Are you fucking kidding me?

712
00:51:38.808 --> 00:51:40.676
Oh my god.

713
00:51:40.711 --> 00:51:43.305
Oh my god, look at you.

714
00:51:46.816 --> 00:51:49.916
- I don't want
to do this right now.


715
00:51:49.951 --> 00:51:51.753
- Has it occurred to you
that I'm the one


716
00:51:51.788 --> 00:51:53.084
who's colossally fucked up?

717
00:51:53.119 --> 00:51:55.482
That my entire life
is embarrassing?


718
00:51:55.517 --> 00:51:57.528
The having a kid at 18,
the divorce,


719
00:51:57.563 --> 00:51:59.134
the pathetic affairs,
the mediocre novels,


720
00:51:59.158 --> 00:52:01.598
fucking all of it
is a clusterfuck...


721
00:52:01.633 --> 00:52:04.491
And even worse, a cliché!
- Okay.


722
00:52:04.526 --> 00:52:06.933
- Has it occurred to you
that I also lost my father


723
00:52:06.968 --> 00:52:09.573
to suicide and I'm having
a hard time getting over it?


724
00:52:09.608 --> 00:52:12.202
That I also am struggling
to find meaning in my pathetic,


725
00:52:12.237 --> 00:52:15.304
stupid life and that I also
think that this whole thing


726
00:52:15.339 --> 00:52:17.317
is a ridiculous farce and
the only intelligent response


727
00:52:17.341 --> 00:52:18.857
would be to kill myself?
But I pull back


728
00:52:18.881 --> 00:52:20.782
from that conclusion
because it creates


729
00:52:20.817 --> 00:52:22.718
a certain onus
that is unpalatable,


730
00:52:22.753 --> 00:52:24.984
like your fucking
Virginia Woolf.


731
00:52:25.019 --> 00:52:26.854
You have...

732
00:52:26.889 --> 00:52:30.517
you have an amazing partner
who loves you


733
00:52:30.552 --> 00:52:32.662
and a career that
the whole world respects


734
00:52:32.697 --> 00:52:34.323
and gives you shitloads
of money for,


735
00:52:34.358 --> 00:52:36.875
a career that you could leave at
any moment and just be labelled


736
00:52:36.899 --> 00:52:38.536
"mysterious" or "eccentric,"
and go live in Paris


737
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.164
in the fucking Marais
or whatever that...


738
00:52:40.199 --> 00:52:42.177
That fucking arrond, arrondis...
- It's called the arrond...


739
00:52:42.201 --> 00:52:43.497
- Don't you fucking correct me

740
00:52:43.532 --> 00:52:45.015
with your superior
knowledge of French!


741
00:52:45.039 --> 00:52:46.819
You have a beautiful house
that magically cleans itself.


742
00:52:46.843 --> 00:52:49.140
- I have a cleaning lady, Yoli.

743
00:52:49.175 --> 00:52:50.856
You have a low-grade
understanding of despair,


744
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.143
by the way.

745
00:52:52.178 --> 00:52:55.212
- Can you not see
that I need your help?


746
00:52:55.247 --> 00:52:56.851
That maybe you're
here for a reason,


747
00:52:56.886 --> 00:52:58.655
which is to be a sister to me?!

748
00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:01.691
- You have had my help
all along, okay?


749
00:53:01.726 --> 00:53:03.924
I had to be perfect
so you could fuck up,


750
00:53:03.959 --> 00:53:06.223
and you were more than happy
to take on that role!


751
00:53:06.258 --> 00:53:09.094
Also, you know, one of us
had to show some fucking empathy


752
00:53:09.129 --> 00:53:11.228
towards Dad and his
acres of existential sadness.


753
00:53:11.263 --> 00:53:13.164
- Why?
- Because nobody else would!


754
00:53:13.199 --> 00:53:14.495
- That means we chose life.

755
00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.244
It doesn't mean we don't
or we didn't fucking care.


756
00:53:16.268 --> 00:53:18.235
- You don't
understand a fucking thing!


757
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:19.566
- I do understand!

758
00:53:19.601 --> 00:53:21.403
Just be like the rest of us:

759
00:53:21.438 --> 00:53:23.779
get fat, start smoking,
play piano badly, whatever.


760
00:53:23.814 --> 00:53:26.342
Just know that you'll eventually
get what you want most in life.


761
00:53:26.377 --> 00:53:28.883
- What's that?
- Death.


762
00:53:28.918 --> 00:53:31.413
So why can't you wait
around and be patient


763
00:53:31.448 --> 00:53:33.052
like the rest of us?

764
00:53:33.087 --> 00:53:35.186
Hasn't Mom suffered enough?
- That is so...


765
00:53:35.221 --> 00:53:37.452
- You just love the fucking
perverse idea of an encore.


766
00:53:37.487 --> 00:53:39.487
- Shut up!
You shut up!


767
00:54:15.998 --> 00:54:18.130
- Can't we just talk?

768
00:54:19.903 --> 00:54:21.595
- About what?

769
00:54:24.666 --> 00:54:28.107
- Anything.

770
00:54:28.142 --> 00:54:29.779
- Sure.

771
00:54:29.814 --> 00:54:34.982
But you seem to want me
to follow some hidden script,


772
00:54:35.017 --> 00:54:37.512
and when I veer from it,

773
00:54:37.547 --> 00:54:39.888
because I don't know
what it is in the first place,


774
00:54:39.923 --> 00:54:44.486
you're like,
"No, don't talk."


775
00:54:44.521 --> 00:54:48.523
You don't want me to talk about
the past because it's painful,


776
00:54:48.558 --> 00:54:51.999
because there were good times.

777
00:54:52.034 --> 00:54:53.495
There's life,

778
00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:55.772
and maybe it'll persuade you
to change your mind.


779
00:54:55.807 --> 00:54:58.104
And you don't want me
to talk about the future


780
00:54:58.139 --> 00:55:00.777
because you don't see one.

781
00:55:00.812 --> 00:55:05.782
So, um...

782
00:55:05.817 --> 00:55:09.511
okay, I'll just talk
about this moment.


783
00:55:12.516 --> 00:55:16.023
I inhaled.

784
00:55:16.058 --> 00:55:19.521
I exhaled.

785
00:55:19.556 --> 00:55:22.557
I'm standing up.

786
00:55:22.592 --> 00:55:26.462
I'm walking over here.

787
00:55:26.497 --> 00:55:29.971
A second is passing,

788
00:55:30.006 --> 00:55:32.776
and another one...

789
00:55:32.811 --> 00:55:36.373
and another one.

790
00:55:36.408 --> 00:55:38.749
- Have you thought
any more about Switzerland?


791
00:55:44.746 --> 00:55:47.021
- Does Nic know?

792
00:55:47.056 --> 00:55:48.924
- He would never take me.

793
00:55:48.959 --> 00:55:51.190
It has to be you.

794
00:55:51.225 --> 00:55:53.291
- What about Mom?
Did you tell her?


795
00:55:53.326 --> 00:55:56.624
- Yoli, listen to me.

796
00:55:56.659 --> 00:56:00.727
Mom and Nic can't know.

797
00:56:00.762 --> 00:56:03.169
Nic still believes
in some kind of medicine


798
00:56:03.204 --> 00:56:05.908
that's gonna cure me.
And Mom...


799
00:56:05.943 --> 00:56:08.504
Mom believes in
I don't know what.


800
00:56:08.539 --> 00:56:10.374
God?

801
00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:12.948
Or odds.

802
00:56:12.983 --> 00:56:16.985
But she's never gonna give up.

803
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:21.583
It has to be you.

804
00:56:21.618 --> 00:56:23.750
- So, what?
We just sneak off to Zurich,


805
00:56:23.785 --> 00:56:25.862
just the two of us?

806
00:56:25.897 --> 00:56:28.458
- Yeah, why not?

807
00:56:28.493 --> 00:56:30.834
- Because Nic
would notice in five minutes


808
00:56:30.869 --> 00:56:32.264
that you were gone.
He would...


809
00:56:32.299 --> 00:56:34.728
he would put it
together somehow,


810
00:56:34.763 --> 00:56:36.763
find a paper trail.
Then he'd hate me,


811
00:56:36.798 --> 00:56:38.204
and Mom would have
a heart attack.


812
00:56:38.239 --> 00:56:40.272
It's so ridiculous, Elf.

813
00:56:40.307 --> 00:56:41.911
It's so improbable.

814
00:56:41.946 --> 00:56:44.276
- If you love me, Yoli,
you would take me.


815
00:56:44.311 --> 00:56:45.574
- I do love you.

816
00:56:45.609 --> 00:56:49.512
I love you so...

817
00:56:49.547 --> 00:56:51.415
- These came for you.

818
00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:53.186
- Oh, okay.
Yeah.


819
00:56:53.221 --> 00:56:55.782
You can give those to me.

820
00:56:55.817 --> 00:56:57.586
Thank you.

821
00:57:34.196 --> 00:57:37.329
I have a piano inside of me.

822
00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:44.369
- What kind?

823
00:57:44.404 --> 00:57:46.668
- An old Heintzman.

824
00:57:49.145 --> 00:57:53.279
- But it's completely
hollowed out and made of glass.


825
00:57:55.316 --> 00:57:59.252
I can feel it squeezing
against my ribs.


826
00:58:03.885 --> 00:58:07.590
Sometimes I can
feel the hard edge


827
00:58:07.625 --> 00:58:09.526
pushing against my skin,

828
00:58:09.561 --> 00:58:12.331
and I'm terrified

829
00:58:12.366 --> 00:58:15.796
that it's gonna break through
and I'll bleed to death.


830
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:21.912
When I hear bottles smash,
I think,


831
00:58:21.947 --> 00:58:24.948
"This is it.
This is it."


832
00:58:35.851 --> 00:58:37.422
When I wake up in the morning,

833
00:58:37.457 --> 00:58:42.361
I have moments of
excruciating hope.


834
00:58:42.396 --> 00:58:46.431
The sun has risen and I think,

835
00:58:46.466 --> 00:58:49.038
"Maybe today will be different."

836
00:58:53.374 --> 00:58:56.111
But the day always darkens.

837
00:58:59.941 --> 00:59:02.546
It never changes,

838
00:59:02.581 --> 00:59:04.911
and I'm certain
that the future will be


839
00:59:04.946 --> 00:59:08.321
an endless repetition of
the same disappointment.


840
00:59:12.756 --> 00:59:16.626
No matter how hard I try,
I can't see beyond it.


841
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:31.278
Take me to Switzerland.

842
00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:41.750
I don't want to die alone.

843
00:59:47.164 --> 00:59:49.956
- I don't want
you to die at all.


844
01:00:56.057 --> 01:00:58.860
- Yoli, you promised
to send the divorce papers


845
01:00:58.895 --> 01:01:01.632
three days ago,
and they're still not here.


846
01:01:01.667 --> 01:01:04.635
What's the problem?

847
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.769
- You're young, you're in love.

848
01:01:06.804 --> 01:01:09.838
Irony is your default mechanism.

849
01:01:09.873 --> 01:01:12.379
"Let's get matching tattoos!"

850
01:01:12.414 --> 01:01:17.153
"Let us slay hypocrisy
with jokes and magic."


851
01:01:17.188 --> 01:01:19.188
- Till death do us part.

852
01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:28.626
- Hey, Mom.

853
01:01:28.661 --> 01:01:32.135
- Your aunt, she fainted today.

854
01:01:34.095 --> 01:01:36.469
- What... is... is she alright?

855
01:01:36.504 --> 01:01:37.866
- Well, she broke her arm

856
01:01:37.901 --> 01:01:40.869
and they've admitted her
to a chief cardiology.


857
01:01:40.904 --> 01:01:43.344
- Cardiology for her arm?

858
01:01:43.379 --> 01:01:47.007
- No.
She's having chest pains.


859
01:01:47.042 --> 01:01:50.780
That's why she fainted.

860
01:01:50.815 --> 01:01:53.453
- Okay.

861
01:02:23.045 --> 01:02:26.618
- Whoa, what's your problem?

862
01:02:28.226 --> 01:02:29.885
- Excuse me?

863
01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.623
- You're way
too close to my car.


864
01:02:31.658 --> 01:02:34.593
If you scratch it, I swear,
there'll be hell to pay.


865
01:02:34.628 --> 01:02:37.024
- Hell to pay?

866
01:02:37.059 --> 01:02:39.433
Did you really just say
there'd be hell to pay


867
01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:41.798
if I touch your fucking car?

868
01:02:41.833 --> 01:02:46.242
Can't you see that my car
isn't touching your fucking car?


869
01:02:46.277 --> 01:02:48.442
- Hey,
what's your fucking problem?


870
01:02:48.477 --> 01:02:50.972
- My problem?
My problem!


871
01:02:51.007 --> 01:02:52.479
Fuck you!

872
01:02:52.514 --> 01:02:53.953
My problem is that
I have to go upstairs


873
01:02:53.977 --> 01:02:55.812
and see if my sister
feels like living today


874
01:02:55.847 --> 01:02:57.880
or if they can fix my aunt's
literal broken heart.


875
01:02:57.915 --> 01:02:59.728
And in case you haven't noticed,
the parking spots


876
01:02:59.752 --> 01:03:01.620
in this hospital are
really fucking small!


877
01:03:01.655 --> 01:03:03.655
Hey, excuse me,
are you guys together?


878
01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:05.591
Is this shithead
the baby's father?


879
01:03:05.626 --> 01:03:08.429
Uh, just let me know one thing.

880
01:03:08.464 --> 01:03:10.123
Um, has he ever
cared about a human


881
01:03:10.158 --> 01:03:12.334
as much as he cares
about his fucking car?


882
01:03:12.369 --> 01:03:14.094
- Okay, okay, okay.

883
01:03:14.129 --> 01:03:16.129
- And God forbid
the biggest tragedy in his life


884
01:03:16.164 --> 01:03:17.804
is that his car may
get a fucking scratch!


885
01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:19.000
What the fuck are you doing?

886
01:03:19.035 --> 01:03:20.452
- I've got your
license plate number.


887
01:03:20.476 --> 01:03:21.805
Just don't hit the car.

888
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.422
- Hey, don't you
fucking walk away from me!


889
01:03:23.446 --> 01:03:24.775
I am not finished yet!

890
01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:26.007
- Let's go, let's go.

891
01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:27.294
- Do you want
my fucking insurance?!


892
01:03:27.318 --> 01:03:28.658
You can have that!
Do you want my, uh,


893
01:03:28.682 --> 01:03:30.847
my tax returns
for the last ten years?!


894
01:03:30.882 --> 01:03:32.948
- You're crazy!
- Hey, fuck you!


895
01:03:32.983 --> 01:03:36.292
Hey, fuck you, you stupid fuck!

896
01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:38.657
Fuck you!

897
01:03:38.692 --> 01:03:41.891
- Fuck!

898
01:03:41.926 --> 01:03:45.466
Fuck!

899
01:03:55.445 --> 01:03:56.873
- Everything okay?

900
01:03:56.908 --> 01:03:59.249
- Oh, yeah, just had
a little trouble parking.


901
01:04:12.121 --> 01:04:14.858
My aunt was
being well taken care of.


902
01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:18.400
The nurse assured us that
her surgery would be routine.


903
01:04:18.435 --> 01:04:21.766
She looked us in the eye.
She laughed at our jokes.


904
01:04:25.409 --> 01:04:26.903
If you have to end up
in the hospital,


905
01:04:26.938 --> 01:04:29.103
try to focus all your pain
in your heart


906
01:04:29.138 --> 01:04:32.238
rather than in your head.

907
01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:50.432
- Yolandi Von Riesen?

908
01:04:50.467 --> 01:04:52.731
- Oh!
Hello, Mrs. Funk.


909
01:04:52.766 --> 01:04:54.128
- I thought you'd moved away.

910
01:04:54.163 --> 01:04:57.197
- I did, but I'm back.

911
01:04:57.232 --> 01:04:58.935
My aunt's in the hospital.

912
01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:00.200
- Tina Loewen?

913
01:05:00.235 --> 01:05:02.444
- Mm-hm.
She had an event.


914
01:05:02.479 --> 01:05:04.677
A coronary event.

915
01:05:04.712 --> 01:05:07.141
- My brother's
getting a valve replacement.


916
01:05:07.176 --> 01:05:08.582
Very straightforward.

917
01:05:08.617 --> 01:05:11.717
Doctors say he'll be
back to running in a week.


918
01:05:11.752 --> 01:05:13.620
Do you remember our son,
Gerhard?


919
01:05:13.655 --> 01:05:15.622
- Yeah, of course.
We were in the same grade.


920
01:05:15.657 --> 01:05:17.030
- Did you know
he's living in London now?


921
01:05:17.054 --> 01:05:18.955
- Ontario?
- No, no, no, England.


922
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:20.726
Gives lectures
all over the world.


923
01:05:20.761 --> 01:05:22.431
Who would have guessed?

924
01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:26.061
- Not me!

925
01:05:26.096 --> 01:05:29.262
- Gerhard saw Elfrieda play
with the London Philharmonic.


926
01:05:29.297 --> 01:05:32.100
He said it was the most
amazing thing he ever heard.


927
01:05:32.135 --> 01:05:36.742
By the way, we were always very
supportive of her piano playing.


928
01:05:36.777 --> 01:05:38.304
What have you been up to?

929
01:05:38.339 --> 01:05:40.746
- Oh, just learning
how to be a good loser.


930
01:05:40.781 --> 01:05:42.077
- Yoli...

931
01:05:42.112 --> 01:05:43.112
I was looking for you.

932
01:05:43.146 --> 01:05:44.211
Hi, Marta.

933
01:05:44.246 --> 01:05:46.081
I got to speak to Elf's doctor.

934
01:05:46.116 --> 01:05:47.588
- Oh.
- Elfrieda?


935
01:05:47.623 --> 01:05:48.952
We were just talking about her.

936
01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.558
Don't tell me
she's in hospital too.


937
01:05:50.593 --> 01:05:53.924
- Yes, she cut her wrists
because she wanted to die.


938
01:05:55.565 --> 01:05:56.828
How's Gerhard?

939
01:05:56.863 --> 01:05:59.369
- Alright, Mom,
let's keep on moving.


940
01:05:59.404 --> 01:06:02.636
Really nice to see you,
Mrs. Funk.


941
01:06:02.671 --> 01:06:05.298
Say hi to Gerhard for me, okay?

942
01:06:22.526 --> 01:06:24.790
- Hi.
- Hi.


943
01:06:29.324 --> 01:06:31.797
- How's Aunt Tina?

944
01:06:31.832 --> 01:06:34.899
- Mm, you know, considering
she has a broken arm


945
01:06:34.934 --> 01:06:38.375
and they're about to open up
her heart, okay, I guess.


946
01:06:41.072 --> 01:06:43.413
- And Mom?

947
01:06:45.615 --> 01:06:47.615
- Stoic, as usual.

948
01:06:53.183 --> 01:06:55.348
Do you...

949
01:06:55.383 --> 01:06:58.560
do you remember
the letters you sent to me


950
01:06:58.595 --> 01:07:00.496
after I broke up
with that guy in Montreal


951
01:07:00.531 --> 01:07:03.466
and I was living alone?

952
01:07:03.501 --> 01:07:05.897
- No, I don't think so.

953
01:07:05.932 --> 01:07:08.504
- It was a quote
from Paul Valéry,


954
01:07:08.539 --> 01:07:11.034
and every day
a letter would arrive


955
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:13.036
with a single word
written on it.


956
01:07:18.043 --> 01:07:20.615
"Breath."

957
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:24.146
- "Dreams."

958
01:07:24.181 --> 01:07:27.413
- "Silence."

959
01:07:27.448 --> 01:07:30.691
- "Invincible calm."

960
01:07:30.726 --> 01:07:33.287
- "You will triumph."

961
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:46.773
It took me months to figure out,
but when I did...


962
01:07:46.808 --> 01:07:48.445
wow.

963
01:07:52.176 --> 01:07:56.750
I don't believe I ever
wrote back to thank you.


964
01:07:56.785 --> 01:08:00.050
- I'm sure you did.
- Probably not.


965
01:08:00.085 --> 01:08:02.888
That would have been like me.

966
01:08:09.798 --> 01:08:12.865
I did some research
on Switzerland.


967
01:08:22.305 --> 01:08:24.877
- Thank you.

968
01:08:32.183 --> 01:08:35.316
But I think it's time I get
Switzerland out of my head.


969
01:09:27.073 --> 01:09:29.370
- Have you heard
of this Portuguese guy,


970
01:09:29.405 --> 01:09:31.812
Fernando Pessoa?

971
01:09:31.847 --> 01:09:34.474
- Is he on the Blue Jays?

972
01:09:34.509 --> 01:09:36.278
- No, he's a poet.

973
01:09:36.313 --> 01:09:38.687
This is his book.

974
01:09:38.722 --> 01:09:41.481
He's dead now.
He killed himself.


975
01:09:41.516 --> 01:09:46.123
- Oh, brother.
Who hasn't?


976
01:09:46.158 --> 01:09:50.226
- Just listen to this, though.

977
01:09:50.261 --> 01:09:54.901
"In the plausible intimacy
of approaching evening,


978
01:09:54.936 --> 01:09:57.706
"as I stand waiting
for the stars to begin


979
01:09:57.741 --> 01:10:00.137
"at the window
of this fourth-floor room


980
01:10:00.172 --> 01:10:02.711
"that looks out on the infinite,

981
01:10:02.746 --> 01:10:06.880
"my dreams move to the rhythm
required by long journeys"


982
01:10:06.915 --> 01:10:09.784
"to countries as yet unknown,"

983
01:10:09.819 --> 01:10:14.448
"or to countries that are simply
hypothetical or impossible."


984
01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:22.291
- I just remembered
how your sister's smile


985
01:10:22.326 --> 01:10:24.425
is exactly like her father's.

986
01:10:29.036 --> 01:10:30.431
I never...

987
01:10:30.466 --> 01:10:34.600
I never think about it,
and then I'll see her and...


988
01:10:34.635 --> 01:10:36.305
Whoa!
Oh...


989
01:10:42.082 --> 01:10:46.348
- Oh, Elfrieda!

990
01:10:54.226 --> 01:10:56.930
- It's okay, Mom.

991
01:10:56.965 --> 01:10:57.997
It's okay.

992
01:10:59.495 --> 01:11:03.970
- Oh, God.
Oh...


993
01:11:04.005 --> 01:11:06.599
Oof!

994
01:11:10.407 --> 01:11:12.308
- Hello?

995
01:11:12.343 --> 01:11:13.343
Oh, hi.

996
01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.645
Okay, yeah.

997
01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.186
We'll be there.

998
01:11:22.221 --> 01:11:24.826
Bye-bye.

999
01:11:24.861 --> 01:11:27.125
That was Nic.

1000
01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.929
He said they're
letting Elf go home


1001
01:11:28.964 --> 01:11:30.997
from the hospital Friday.

1002
01:11:32.693 --> 01:11:34.165
- No.

1003
01:11:36.202 --> 01:11:38.774
No, they can't.

1004
01:11:59.456 --> 01:12:02.292
- It's been going
really well with the doctor,


1005
01:12:02.327 --> 01:12:04.360
and for the first time
in such a long time


1006
01:12:04.395 --> 01:12:05.999
I've been thinking
so much about my music


1007
01:12:06.034 --> 01:12:07.737
and how I have
to get back to playing,


1008
01:12:07.772 --> 01:12:11.169
which is why I called Claudio
and I confirmed the tour.


1009
01:12:13.239 --> 01:12:16.471
- I know it's the right
thing for me to do.


1010
01:12:16.506 --> 01:12:19.507
We finally feel like
I'm back on track.


1011
01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:23.676
- Dr. Johns?

1012
01:12:23.711 --> 01:12:25.249
Dr. Johns.
DR.- Yes?


1013
01:12:25.284 --> 01:12:27.284
- She...
she's not ready.


1014
01:12:27.319 --> 01:12:31.288
She's pretending to be
normal, sane, cured,


1015
01:12:31.323 --> 01:12:33.433
and I'm sure you're thinking,
"Okay, let's free up a bed.


1016
01:12:33.457 --> 01:12:34.962
"Let's let this one go,"
but I am...


1017
01:12:34.997 --> 01:12:38.834
Um, I'm begging you,

1018
01:12:38.869 --> 01:12:40.561
please don't do that.

1019
01:12:40.596 --> 01:12:42.772
DR.- She's on
the right path,


1020
01:12:42.807 --> 01:12:45.016
and it's very important for
the patient to feel empowered


1021
01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.776
by being allowed
to make big decisions.


1022
01:12:46.811 --> 01:12:48.844
- Well, one big
decision she could make


1023
01:12:48.879 --> 01:12:50.637
would be the decision
to kill herself,


1024
01:12:50.672 --> 01:12:52.045
and we can assume
that nobody wants


1025
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.212
her to make that
decision, right?


1026
01:12:54.247 --> 01:12:56.214
Last week,
she's completely depressed.


1027
01:12:56.249 --> 01:12:58.392
Asked me to take her to
a suicide clinic in Switzerland,


1028
01:12:58.416 --> 01:13:02.121
and this week,

1029
01:13:02.156 --> 01:13:04.750
what, she's just better?

1030
01:13:04.785 --> 01:13:06.257
For what reason?

1031
01:13:06.292 --> 01:13:08.094
DR.- She's agreed
to take her medications,


1032
01:13:08.129 --> 01:13:09.876
book follow-up appointments,
so I have to give her


1033
01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:12.362
the benefit of the doubt.

1034
01:13:12.397 --> 01:13:15.629
I've seen many patients leave
here in worse shape than her


1035
01:13:15.664 --> 01:13:18.434
and yet thrive once
they return to their lives.


1036
01:13:28.644 --> 01:13:32.712
Ah, solving that question

1037
01:13:32.747 --> 01:13:36.023
brings the priest
and the doctor,


1038
01:13:36.058 --> 01:13:38.388
in their long coats,

1039
01:13:38.423 --> 01:13:40.687
running over the fields.

1040
01:14:34.413 --> 01:14:37.645
- Well, I'm having serious
caffeine withdrawal.


1041
01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.682
This cast itches like hell.

1042
01:14:41.717 --> 01:14:43.321
- Your surgery is at 6 tomorrow?

1043
01:14:43.356 --> 01:14:45.994
- Yes.

1044
01:14:46.029 --> 01:14:47.688
- You nervous?

1045
01:14:47.723 --> 01:14:50.196
- No.

1046
01:14:50.231 --> 01:14:53.166
If your mother can
survive heart surgery,


1047
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:54.695
well, so can I.

1048
01:14:57.634 --> 01:15:00.338
- Alright.
I better go.


1049
01:15:00.373 --> 01:15:03.077
I'll let you get some rest.

1050
01:15:10.647 --> 01:15:12.680
- We're Loewens.

1051
01:15:12.715 --> 01:15:15.386
Don't ever forget that, Yoli.

1052
01:15:15.421 --> 01:15:18.851
We're lions!

1053
01:15:18.886 --> 01:15:20.853
- Sure.

1054
01:15:32.273 --> 01:15:35.802
My aunt's surgery is over.

1055
01:15:35.837 --> 01:15:39.707
The operation had gone well.

1056
01:15:39.742 --> 01:15:43.183
The doctor was pleased
and told us so.


1057
01:15:43.218 --> 01:15:46.714
And then her organs
started to fail,


1058
01:15:46.749 --> 01:15:48.848
one by one.

1059
01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.136
- Is this almost too much, Mom?

1060
01:16:05.768 --> 01:16:07.240
- Almost.

1061
01:16:18.781 --> 01:16:21.683
- Tina was a sensation.

1062
01:16:21.718 --> 01:16:25.060
She adored big hats
with wide brims.


1063
01:16:25.095 --> 01:16:28.591
Whistles followed her
down the street.


1064
01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:33.464
She loved road trips,
talking late into the night,


1065
01:16:33.499 --> 01:16:37.237
bear hugs, and good deals.

1066
01:16:37.272 --> 01:16:40.042
She was a fiercely devoted wife

1067
01:16:40.077 --> 01:16:44.475
and mom and aunt

1068
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:46.983
and big sister to me.

1069
01:16:50.846 --> 01:16:53.319
When my wedding veil
caught on fire,


1070
01:16:53.354 --> 01:16:56.883
I was signing the registry
and I was too close to a candle,


1071
01:16:56.918 --> 01:17:00.326
and she bolted to her house,
grabbed her own veil,


1072
01:17:00.361 --> 01:17:02.295
ran back to the church,
and plopped it on my head


1073
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:06.101
without hardly missing a beat.

1074
01:17:06.136 --> 01:17:10.237
But her forte was coffee.

1075
01:17:10.272 --> 01:17:12.074
On the day before she died,

1076
01:17:12.109 --> 01:17:16.276
she asked me to please bring her
some good, strong coffee.


1077
01:17:16.311 --> 01:17:18.674
When it finally arrived...

1078
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:21.182
Oh my!

1079
01:17:21.217 --> 01:17:24.020
- She was not able to drink it.

1080
01:17:27.454 --> 01:17:31.423
Tina, we will miss not only
your many helpful ways


1081
01:17:31.458 --> 01:17:35.757
but your positive spirit
spreading love and goodwill.


1082
01:17:37.827 --> 01:17:40.399
You were the last of the lions.

1083
01:17:44.636 --> 01:17:46.570
Rest in peace.

1084
01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:53.148
Life's always
teaching us lessons.


1085
01:17:53.183 --> 01:17:55.150
Just because someone
is playing with the ashes


1086
01:17:55.185 --> 01:17:56.877
of your protagonist

1087
01:17:56.912 --> 01:18:00.650
doesn't mean you stop
telling the story.


1088
01:18:00.685 --> 01:18:03.785
- And so, I was standing in line

1089
01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:07.855
outside the Notre-Dame Basilica,
waiting for the service.


1090
01:18:07.890 --> 01:18:10.363
There were over

1091
01:18:10.398 --> 01:18:12.563
Oh...

1092
01:18:12.598 --> 01:18:16.204
And the man in front of me
asks me where I'm from,


1093
01:18:16.239 --> 01:18:19.504
and he couldn't believe
I came so far for the funeral.


1094
01:18:19.539 --> 01:18:22.474
- He was your hero.

1095
01:18:22.509 --> 01:18:25.972
- In spite of his
many flaws, yes, he...


1096
01:18:26.007 --> 01:18:28.810
he was my hero.

1097
01:18:28.845 --> 01:18:32.814
And so, we began talking

1098
01:18:32.849 --> 01:18:35.190
and we had the loveliest
conversation about Trudeau,


1099
01:18:35.225 --> 01:18:38.556
his eccentricities, his gifts,

1100
01:18:38.591 --> 01:18:41.229
his life.

1101
01:18:41.264 --> 01:18:44.925
And then the strangest
thing happened:


1102
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.270
the man invited me
to a party at his house.


1103
01:18:49.305 --> 01:18:53.241
And it was a very fancy house
in a very fancy neighbourhood,


1104
01:18:53.276 --> 01:18:55.936
with champagne.

1105
01:18:55.971 --> 01:18:57.575
- Oh!

1106
01:18:57.610 --> 01:19:00.578
- Imagine me at
a complete stranger's house.


1107
01:19:03.044 --> 01:19:05.748
Did you have
a glass of champagne?


1108
01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:07.156
- Oh, no.

1109
01:19:07.191 --> 01:19:09.290
Oh, no.

1110
01:19:09.325 --> 01:19:10.786
No.

1111
01:19:12.988 --> 01:19:14.328
No.

1112
01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:29.937
Hello?

1113
01:19:29.972 --> 01:19:31.444
- Have you spoken
with her today?


1114
01:19:31.479 --> 01:19:33.072
- No, but Nic's there.

1115
01:19:33.107 --> 01:19:36.944
- I know, I just wish they'd
answer it or text or whatever.


1116
01:19:36.979 --> 01:19:39.012
I feel like a needy girlfriend.

1117
01:19:39.047 --> 01:19:40.552
I can't stop calling.

1118
01:19:40.587 --> 01:19:42.455
- Yeah,
I'm the overbearing mother.


1119
01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:45.150
Whenever I stop by,
she gives me a look that says,


1120
01:19:45.185 --> 01:19:46.954
"I'm not fooled by you."

1121
01:19:46.989 --> 01:19:49.462
"I know you're
checking up on me."


1122
01:19:49.497 --> 01:19:52.663
But it's impossible not to.

1123
01:20:34.674 --> 01:20:36.168
- Again, again!

1124
01:20:37.611 --> 01:20:38.973
- Uh, no, just no!

1125
01:20:39.008 --> 01:20:41.646
Not even close!

1126
01:20:41.681 --> 01:20:43.208
- What, like that?

1127
01:20:43.243 --> 01:20:45.320
- Oh!

1128
01:20:45.355 --> 01:20:47.047
- No!
- Hit it.


1129
01:20:54.056 --> 01:20:56.628
- One second!
One second!


1130
01:22:14.576 --> 01:22:15.905
- Does my mom know?

1131
01:22:20.274 --> 01:22:23.308
Okay.
I gotta call her.


1132
01:22:43.231 --> 01:22:44.703
- Hello?

1133
01:22:46.707 --> 01:22:48.542
- Mom, are there people there?

1134
01:22:51.206 --> 01:22:52.777
- No, why?

1135
01:23:06.859 --> 01:23:10.322
- Yoli, what happened?

1136
01:23:13.129 --> 01:23:14.535
Tell me.

1137
01:23:17.397 --> 01:23:19.870
Yoli, tell me.

1138
01:24:07.117 --> 01:24:10.954
- Elf had asked me
to go to the library for her.


1139
01:24:10.989 --> 01:24:14.155
I said we should
have lunch first.


1140
01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:17.389
And lunch was normal.

1141
01:24:17.424 --> 01:24:19.358
And then I went to the library
to get the books


1142
01:24:19.393 --> 01:24:21.800
and she said she was
gonna take a nap.


1143
01:24:27.577 --> 01:24:31.337
- Libraries and civilization.

1144
01:24:31.372 --> 01:24:33.240
- What?

1145
01:24:33.275 --> 01:24:35.341
- She believed
libraries were the bedrock


1146
01:24:35.376 --> 01:24:37.486
of civilization.

1147
01:24:37.521 --> 01:24:39.213
- She said
that when you borrow a book,


1148
01:24:39.248 --> 01:24:41.985
you make a promise.

1149
01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:46.693
- To return it.

1150
01:24:46.728 --> 01:24:48.662
A promise to come back.

1151
01:25:00.104 --> 01:25:02.269
- The funeral director
said that...


1152
01:25:05.439 --> 01:25:08.077
because of the impact
of the train,


1153
01:25:08.112 --> 01:25:10.915
we might just
want to see her hand.


1154
01:25:16.758 --> 01:25:21.387
- I need to see Elf's face.

1155
01:25:31.366 --> 01:25:34.268
So there she was,

1156
01:25:34.303 --> 01:25:37.469
the hole in her head sewn up
like a homemade baseball.


1157
01:25:37.504 --> 01:25:38.943
And that's when I thought,

1158
01:25:38.978 --> 01:25:43.750
"Who's the jackass that
stitched up my sister's face?"


1159
01:25:43.785 --> 01:25:47.512
And after a minute of staring
at her, hoping she would blink,


1160
01:25:47.547 --> 01:25:52.352
open her eyes, and laugh
at the absurd spectacle,


1161
01:25:52.387 --> 01:25:54.486
I changed my mind
and felt a powerful,


1162
01:25:54.521 --> 01:25:57.324
oceanic wave of gratitude
towards the mortician


1163
01:25:57.359 --> 01:25:59.997
who did his best
trying to restore


1164
01:26:00.032 --> 01:26:02.571
my sister's beauty
for one last time.


1165
01:26:25.695 --> 01:26:27.827
So, Elf, I finally checked out

1166
01:26:27.862 --> 01:26:31.556
your beloved D.H. Lawrence.

1167
01:26:31.591 --> 01:26:35.362
I remember your incredulity when
you found out I hadn't read it.


1168
01:26:35.397 --> 01:26:38.871
God, you can be
a snob sometimes.


1169
01:26:38.906 --> 01:26:41.335
Anyway, you were right
about the first paragraph


1170
01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:45.570
of Lady Chatterley's Lover.

1171
01:26:45.605 --> 01:26:48.045
"Ours is essentially
a tragic age,


1172
01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:51.510
"so we refuse
to take it tragically.


1173
01:26:51.545 --> 01:26:55.624
"The cataclysm has happened,
we are among the ruins,


1174
01:26:55.659 --> 01:26:58.220
"we start to build up
new little habitats,


1175
01:26:58.255 --> 01:27:01.960
"to have new little hopes.

1176
01:27:01.995 --> 01:27:06.360
"It is rather hard work:"

1177
01:27:06.395 --> 01:27:10.298
"there is now no smooth road
into the future."


1178
01:27:17.747 --> 01:27:22.343
"We've got to live, no matter
how many skies have fallen."


1179
01:27:22.378 --> 01:27:25.544
- And no matter how much
shit we've buried ourselves in.


1180
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:34.762
Do you remember when your father

1181
01:27:34.797 --> 01:27:38.293
tried to start
a library in town?


1182
01:27:38.328 --> 01:27:40.999
The elders, they kept saying no.

1183
01:27:41.034 --> 01:27:42.836
But he persisted.

1184
01:27:42.871 --> 01:27:46.906
Completely out of character,
he refused to back down.


1185
01:27:46.941 --> 01:27:50.206
Insisted it was
important to the community.


1186
01:27:50.241 --> 01:27:53.946
So they told him, "If you
can get 400 signatures,"


1187
01:27:53.981 --> 01:27:56.575
which was almost everyone
in the East Village,


1188
01:27:56.610 --> 01:27:58.544
that they would consider it.

1189
01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.790
- Hello?
- Oh, hello.


1190
01:28:02.825 --> 01:28:04.825
Is Elfrieda Von Riesen there,
please?


1191
01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:06.761
- How do you
spell the last name?


1192
01:28:06.796 --> 01:28:11.425
- R
-I
-E
-S
-E
-N.

1193
01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:15.264
- I'm sorry, Miss Riesen
was released weeks ago.


1194
01:28:15.299 --> 01:28:19.268
Night after night he went out.

1195
01:28:19.303 --> 01:28:21.204
He was crazy.

1196
01:28:21.239 --> 01:28:22.975
- Seriously?

1197
01:28:23.010 --> 01:28:24.669
Are you certain some
mistake wasn't made?


1198
01:28:24.704 --> 01:28:26.011
She was very sick.

1199
01:28:26.046 --> 01:28:27.881
How can you be sure
she was ready to leave?


1200
01:28:27.916 --> 01:28:29.718
- Who is this, please?

1201
01:28:36.793 --> 01:28:38.650
- He was so proud.

1202
01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:47.098
- He was so proud.

1203
01:28:47.133 --> 01:28:50.365
Makes me want to cry even now
just thinking about it.


1204
01:28:59.343 --> 01:29:03.180
- No offence, but this place
is kind of a shithole.


1205
01:29:03.215 --> 01:29:06.348
- No offence, but the payout
from your life insurance policy


1206
01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:10.550
doesn't really buy a whole lot
of house in Toronto these days.


1207
01:29:10.585 --> 01:29:13.157
- Do you like
the monthly stipend of $2,000


1208
01:29:13.192 --> 01:29:15.159
so you can finally
finish your novel?


1209
01:29:15.194 --> 01:29:18.525
- A stipend?

1210
01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.307
I couldn't believe
you actually used that word


1211
01:29:20.331 --> 01:29:22.463
in your will.

1212
01:29:22.498 --> 01:29:26.335
So Virginia Woolf.

1213
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:28.733
- "A woman must have money

1214
01:29:28.768 --> 01:29:32.979
"and a room of her own
if she is to write fiction."


1215
01:29:33.014 --> 01:29:36.378
So you finally got Mom
to move to Toronto?


1216
01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:39.381
- It was time
to circle our wagons.


1217
01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:41.922
We've lost half our men,
supplies are dwindling,


1218
01:29:41.957 --> 01:29:45.156
and winter is coming.

1219
01:29:45.191 --> 01:29:49.193
There was no debate,
no discussion.


1220
01:29:49.228 --> 01:29:51.393
We three ladies
will live in this old,


1221
01:29:51.428 --> 01:29:53.494
wretched house thanks to you.

1222
01:29:58.974 --> 01:30:01.733
- How are you feeling?
- Okay, I guess.


1223
01:30:01.768 --> 01:30:04.571
Some days are better
than others.


1224
01:30:04.606 --> 01:30:06.771
- Man, I keep thinking
how hard it must be,


1225
01:30:06.806 --> 01:30:08.641
especially because
she died by her own hand.


1226
01:30:08.676 --> 01:30:10.775
- Okay...

1227
01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:13.085
Can you please not say
"Died by her own hand"?


1228
01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.548
- Sorry, how should I say it?

1229
01:30:14.583 --> 01:30:16.550
- She killed herself.

1230
01:30:16.585 --> 01:30:17.760
If someone gets murdered,
do you say,


1231
01:30:17.784 --> 01:30:21.093
"They died by another's hand"?

1232
01:30:21.128 --> 01:30:24.195
This isn't
The Count of Monte Cristo.


1233
01:30:24.230 --> 01:30:25.460
- I can't help but think

1234
01:30:25.495 --> 01:30:27.660
it just seems like
such a selfish act.


1235
01:30:27.695 --> 01:30:29.101
- Selfish?

1236
01:30:29.136 --> 01:30:31.532
How can it be selfish?
If you...


1237
01:30:31.567 --> 01:30:33.138
if you haven't felt
agony firsthand,


1238
01:30:33.173 --> 01:30:36.636
you can't pass judgement.

1239
01:30:36.671 --> 01:30:40.310
- Can I get a refill, please?

1240
01:30:40.345 --> 01:30:42.312
- Actually lately,
more and more,


1241
01:30:42.347 --> 01:30:44.886
I've begun to measure a person's
character and integrity


1242
01:30:44.921 --> 01:30:47.251
by their ability
to kill themselves.


1243
01:30:47.286 --> 01:30:48.681
- This ought to be good.

1244
01:30:48.716 --> 01:30:50.716
- Thank you.

1245
01:30:50.751 --> 01:30:53.125
What the hell are
you talking about?


1246
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.588
- Vladimir Putin?
No way.


1247
01:30:54.623 --> 01:30:56.865
Jeremy Irons?
Yeah.


1248
01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:58.559
Donald Trump?

1249
01:30:58.594 --> 01:31:02.398
Like, no question, not a chance.
That kind of thing.


1250
01:31:02.433 --> 01:31:04.972
- And me?

1251
01:31:05.007 --> 01:31:07.007
Do I have what it takes
to kill myself?


1252
01:31:25.126 --> 01:31:26.994
- When I looked up
Final Exit on Amazon,


1253
01:31:27.029 --> 01:31:30.096
I was shocked by how high
the user ratings were.


1254
01:31:30.131 --> 01:31:32.032
There were a couple of
verified purchasers


1255
01:31:32.067 --> 01:31:33.858
who left glowing reviews
despite the fact


1256
01:31:33.893 --> 01:31:38.236
that it was found next to
the bodies of their loved ones.


1257
01:31:42.176 --> 01:31:45.507
- I have to ask you something.

1258
01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:48.114
Why do you keep
calling the hospital?


1259
01:31:50.448 --> 01:31:52.811
- I don't.

1260
01:31:52.846 --> 01:31:54.681
What?

1261
01:31:54.716 --> 01:31:57.519
- I tracked your activities.

1262
01:31:57.554 --> 01:31:59.785
I've seen the cell phone bills,
the calls,


1263
01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:01.787
the empty wine bottles.

1264
01:32:01.822 --> 01:32:04.493
- Looks like all your years
of reading mystery novels


1265
01:32:04.528 --> 01:32:06.099
is finally paying off.

1266
01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:12.369
- Are you trying to haunt
the hospital for letting her go?


1267
01:32:19.444 --> 01:32:21.147
- That's an interesting theory.

1268
01:32:21.182 --> 01:32:23.149
Um...

1269
01:32:23.184 --> 01:32:25.019
I don't know what I'm doing.

1270
01:32:27.056 --> 01:32:28.924
- It has to stop.

1271
01:32:38.463 --> 01:32:42.201
- They screwed up!

1272
01:33:03.224 --> 01:33:04.586
- I'm sorry.

1273
01:33:04.621 --> 01:33:06.390
- Mm-mm.

1274
01:33:15.962 --> 01:33:19.568
You know,
we can all fight really hard,


1275
01:33:19.603 --> 01:33:22.934
but we can also
acknowledge defeat,


1276
01:33:22.969 --> 01:33:26.311
stop fighting,
and just call a spade a spade.


1277
01:33:30.152 --> 01:33:34.550
- What do you do
when a spade isn't a spade?


1278
01:33:34.585 --> 01:33:38.554
- Well, yeah, there
are things like that in life


1279
01:33:38.589 --> 01:33:41.821
that aren't spades,
and we can just let them...


1280
01:33:41.856 --> 01:33:45.264
stay that way.

1281
01:33:45.299 --> 01:33:47.629
- I'm a writer.
It's very difficult


1282
01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:51.534
for me to leave those
spades so undefined.


1283
01:33:51.569 --> 01:33:53.470
- I realize that.

1284
01:33:58.345 --> 01:34:02.347
The problem is
the pain of letting go


1285
01:34:02.382 --> 01:34:06.010
of grief is...

1286
01:34:06.045 --> 01:34:08.485
it's just as painful,

1287
01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:12.126
even more painful
than the grief itself.


1288
01:34:14.889 --> 01:34:17.758
We're meant to move on.

1289
01:34:42.081 --> 01:34:43.663
- You know,
this surely has to constitute


1290
01:34:43.687 --> 01:34:44.851
some sort of child abuse,

1291
01:34:44.886 --> 01:34:47.392
making me watch you
sign the divorce papers!


1292
01:34:47.427 --> 01:34:50.296
- Yeah, well, unfortunately
someone needs to bear witness


1293
01:34:50.331 --> 01:34:53.794
to my failure, and who better
than the product of the union?


1294
01:34:53.829 --> 01:34:55.576
- You know what?
That is an interesting theory.


1295
01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.347
I will be sure to bring
that up with my therapist


1296
01:34:57.371 --> 01:34:59.173
that I'm gonna need
for the rest of my life.


1297
01:34:59.208 --> 01:35:01.010
- Sounds great, as long
as your father pays for it.


1298
01:35:01.034 --> 01:35:02.034
- Mm.

1299
01:35:10.318 --> 01:35:11.911
You okay?

1300
01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:24.363
I could sense
the book was coming to an end.


1301
01:35:24.398 --> 01:35:27.663
The novel, but really a memoir
with enough red herrings


1302
01:35:27.698 --> 01:35:31.766
that I could deny everything,
was approaching 130,000 words.


1303
01:35:31.801 --> 01:35:34.670
I'd give my mother
the word count in the morning.


1304
01:35:34.705 --> 01:35:36.936
My guess, she'd be disappointed
with the sorrow quotient


1305
01:35:36.971 --> 01:35:39.675
my literary efforts
once again produced.


1306
01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:41.908
There was no Rotterdam plot.

1307
01:35:41.943 --> 01:35:43.778
I couldn't even rework
a tiny part of it


1308
01:35:43.813 --> 01:35:45.681
as some sort of metaphor,

1309
01:35:45.716 --> 01:35:47.782
though I tried.

1310
01:35:47.817 --> 01:35:50.752
I was in that beautiful zone
where the words came easily


1311
01:35:50.787 --> 01:35:53.623
and I was one of the productive
members of society,


1312
01:35:53.658 --> 01:35:56.362
that it mattered,
that I was making a difference,


1313
01:35:56.397 --> 01:35:59.024
that I had done my best.

1314
01:36:07.474 --> 01:36:10.134
I look at that
photograph and wonder,


1315
01:36:10.169 --> 01:36:13.874
were the lines already drawn
and we just didn't know it?


1316
01:36:19.651 --> 01:36:22.817
Elf's favourite poem
was "On Friendship"


1317
01:36:22.852 --> 01:36:25.787
by Samuel Coleridge.

1318
01:36:25.822 --> 01:36:30.627
"I too a sister had,
an only sister."


1319
01:36:30.662 --> 01:36:35.236
"She loved me dearly
and I doted on her."


1320
01:36:35.271 --> 01:36:38.569
"To her I poured forth
all my puny sorrows."


1321
01:36:42.377 --> 01:36:45.939
- Did you actually think I'd
get that inscribed on my back?


1322
01:36:50.143 --> 01:36:53.980
- For a minute there
I was worried, so yes, I did.


1323
01:36:54.015 --> 01:36:56.389
Wouldn't be entirely
out of character.


1324
01:36:56.424 --> 01:36:58.655
- Can you imagine trying
to explain that to a guy


1325
01:36:58.690 --> 01:37:01.328
you're about to have sex with?

1326
01:37:05.829 --> 01:37:07.664
- Might be
a bit of a mood-killer.


1327
01:37:07.699 --> 01:37:09.864
- I'd never get laid again.

1328
01:37:09.899 --> 01:37:12.031
- Don't sell yourself short.
You're a catch.


1329
01:37:12.066 --> 01:37:14.407
- Hmm, that's true.

1330
01:37:14.442 --> 01:37:17.608
I do come with drawbacks
that are not readily evident.


1331
01:37:22.483 --> 01:37:24.912
- Do you remember when
we watched that solar eclipse?


1332
01:37:29.358 --> 01:37:32.722
- It was so cold.

1333
01:37:32.757 --> 01:37:36.330
- We wore welding helmets,
didn't we?


1334
01:37:36.365 --> 01:37:38.266
- Where did you get them?

1335
01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:40.092
- I forget.

1336
01:37:40.127 --> 01:37:43.271
Some guy I knew.

1337
01:37:43.306 --> 01:37:46.230
- It was amazing, wasn't it?

1338
01:37:46.265 --> 01:37:47.869
- Yes.

1339
01:37:53.382 --> 01:37:55.778
The path of totality.

1340
01:37:55.813 --> 01:37:58.418
- Is that what it's called?

1341
01:37:58.453 --> 01:38:01.245
- Yeah.

1342
01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:06.184
Don't you remember
what Dad said?


1343
01:38:06.219 --> 01:38:10.430
The path of totality passed
over us in the early afternoon.


1344
01:38:17.263 --> 01:38:19.604
- The next one's
not supposed to be


1345
01:38:19.639 --> 01:38:22.134
for 1,500 years
or something like that.


1346
01:38:24.105 --> 01:38:26.446
- Then I guess I'll miss it.

1347
01:38:26.481 --> 01:38:29.911
- Me too, I suppose.

1348
01:38:29.946 --> 01:38:31.242
- Who knows?

1349
01:38:35.281 --> 01:38:37.116
Who knows?

1350
01:38:49.603 --> 01:38:51.306
What's your book about?

1351
01:39:08.248 --> 01:39:09.588
- Us.

1352
01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.059
It's about us.
