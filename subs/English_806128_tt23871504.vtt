His Majesty is the one...

who ordered him to do it.

That's a lie!

-No, Your Highness!

If you go,
you'll be in danger, too!

to kill my father?

That's not possible.

If you go to His Majesty now,

Because you didn't
tell them what you saw,

where I am now, sir.

After eight years of waiting,
my father has passed away...

And now I have no one.

I lived without seeing
my mother's face

What about the chief councilor?

Why can't we use it?
