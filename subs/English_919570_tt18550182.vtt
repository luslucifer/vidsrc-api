1
00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:01.055
At your stations!

2
00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:06.472
The line is running!

3
00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:28.096
Cellphones off!

4
00:04:38.513 --> 00:04:40.930
- Can you replace me?
- I'm manning the dropper.


5
00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:42.847
I'll take care of it.

6
00:04:44.722 --> 00:04:47.138
Quit the yapping!

7
00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:56.222
Take care of the loading!

8
00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:25.055
Auner!

9
00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:26.597
You're not on break!

10
00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:30.597
Help him unload the sheep!

11
00:05:34.305 --> 00:05:36.597
- Back to work!
- It's an emergency.


12
00:05:36.763 --> 00:05:38.013
Fucking lazy Gypsy.

13
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.013
What?

14
00:07:14.805 --> 00:07:17.680
For companies with over 30 employees,

15
00:07:17.847 --> 00:07:20.888
the EU grants an extra 56.000.

16
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.722
- And our contribution?
- It's proportional.


17
00:07:23.888 --> 00:07:27.305
But the leased equipment
is taken into account.


18
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.763
Any other calls?

19
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.180
A guy from Topliţa.

20
00:07:32.763 --> 00:07:36.430
When he heard he'd have to move here,
he said he'd think on it.


21
00:07:37.347 --> 00:07:39.888
I'm afraid Traian might leave too.

22
00:07:40.222 --> 00:07:41.805
How's his son?

23
00:07:41.972 --> 00:07:45.347
His mom took him to halotherapy, but...

24
00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:47.888
All this paperwork isn't worth it

25
00:07:48.055 --> 00:07:51.222
if we don't apply for the 136.000 grant.

26
00:07:51.722 --> 00:07:56.347
But I don't see how we could hire
five more bakers before the deadline.


27
00:07:56.805 --> 00:07:59.638
Maybe if we had left
the salary out of the ad?


28
00:07:59.805 --> 00:08:02.055
It saves a lot of phone calls.

29
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.972
Let's put out another series of ads.

30
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.472
Forget the salary,
just say "overtime paid double".


31
00:08:09.638 --> 00:08:10.680
OK.

32
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.847
What do I tell the recruitment agency
about the three workers?


33
00:08:16.013 --> 00:08:18.555
Stall for now. 
Post the ad first.

34
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.472
We'll see.

35
00:08:27.513 --> 00:08:28.472
Hello.

36
00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:29.680
Hi!

37
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:34.930
- Hello!
- Hi, dear.


38
00:08:35.138 --> 00:08:37.638
- Is the pastor in?
- Not yet.


39
00:08:37.805 --> 00:08:39.762
Could I post another ad?

40
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.887
Go ahead, it's open.

41
00:08:42.097 --> 00:08:43.887
- Thanks, bye.
- Bye.


42
00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:49.722
Got you a beer.

43
00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:51.513
- Hello.
- Hi.


44
00:08:51.722 --> 00:08:54.180
- Can you make the rehearsals?
- I'll try.


45
00:08:55.722 --> 00:09:00.180
- Still haven't sold that bike?
- Why? You feel like riding?


46
00:09:02.638 --> 00:09:04.513
Hi, can I post another ad?

47
00:09:04.722 --> 00:09:06.847
- No takers?
- Not really.


48
00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:10.388
- Any word from your cousin?
- He found work in Stuttgart.


49
00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:13.805
- Is he taking Mara?
- No way, they live in a container.


50
00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:17.472
Her mom's in Italy. I'm here with her,
caring for the old folks.


51
00:09:17.638 --> 00:09:19.763
- Send her to rehearsals.
- Who's stopping her?


52
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.263
Hi, Mara. Still rehearsing?

53
00:09:22.513 --> 00:09:23.222
Yeah.

54
00:09:23.388 --> 00:09:25.430
Rehearsing on your phone!

55
00:09:25.597 --> 00:09:29.680
Not true, Grandpa won't let me.
He wants me in our church choir.


56
00:09:29.847 --> 00:09:31.222
You can do both.

57
00:09:31.388 --> 00:09:34.138
- We'll be rehearsing at the school.
- I'll ask.


58
00:09:34.347 --> 00:09:35.055
Madame?

59
00:09:35.222 --> 00:09:36.138
In a moment.

60
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.638
May I?

61
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:38.763
Your telephone.

62
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:39.722
Thanks.

63
00:09:40.138 --> 00:09:43.638
BEWARE OF WILD ANIMALS

64
00:10:01.347 --> 00:10:03.097
Better, wasn't it?

65
00:10:04.388 --> 00:10:06.305
Thank you, Papa Otto.

66
00:10:09.138 --> 00:10:12.180
- We'll move to the school on Monday.
- Good.


67
00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:14.888
Someone will come
to pick up the instruments.


68
00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:16.097
Thank you.

69
00:10:32.305 --> 00:10:34.888
- Can I get a lift to Miercurea Ciuc?
- Hop in.


70
00:10:41.388 --> 00:10:44.013
Hello, your documents, please.

71
00:10:46.972 --> 00:10:49.263
- Coming from?
- Münster, Germany.


72
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.930
Everyone?

73
00:10:51.097 --> 00:10:53.847
Except for him.
He's coming from Regensburg.


74
00:10:55.013 --> 00:10:56.180
Auner?

75
00:10:56.805 --> 00:10:57.680
Yes.

76
00:10:57.847 --> 00:10:59.638
Turn that down!

77
00:11:03.597 --> 00:11:05.347
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.


78
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.513
Shhh, Kaiser!

79
00:11:27.388 --> 00:11:30.347
We keep "professional bakers,
experience required".


80
00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:32.722
And "transport provided".

81
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.555
We just add "overtime paid doubled".

82
00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:38.763
"Double", yes.

83
00:11:41.222 --> 00:11:43.263
No, we leave out the salary.

84
00:11:44.222 --> 00:11:45.763
That's all, yes.

85
00:11:46.638 --> 00:11:49.888
Can you post it online immediately?
I'll pay now.


86
00:11:51.513 --> 00:11:52.805
Thank you.

87
00:13:04.013 --> 00:13:05.847
Good boy!

88
00:13:17.555 --> 00:13:19.222
What are you doing here?

89
00:13:19.472 --> 00:13:21.347
Why haven't you called?

90
00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:23.680
My phone broke.

91
00:13:24.847 --> 00:13:26.638
Take off your shoes.

92
00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:35.305
How is Rudi doing?

93
00:13:35.638 --> 00:13:36.972
The same.

94
00:13:37.555 --> 00:13:38.972
Does he speak?

95
00:13:39.347 --> 00:13:40.472
No.

96
00:13:40.972 --> 00:13:43.972
- Did you see the doctor?
- I asked, yes.


97
00:13:45.097 --> 00:13:48.638
No need to hurry him,
he'll speak when he feels like it.


98
00:13:49.513 --> 00:13:52.388
You haven't brought him anything
for Christmas?


99
00:13:53.055 --> 00:13:54.763
I was in a big hurry.

100
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.013
I'll buy him something here.

101
00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:00.388
Rudi?

102
00:14:02.305 --> 00:14:04.513
Turn that off, Dad's here.

103
00:14:11.763 --> 00:14:12.847
Come.

104
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.513
That's enough, it's late.

105
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.013
We'll just finish the game.

106
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.513
Will you take him to school?

107
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.138
- Doesn't he go alone?
- Not since he got scared.


108
00:14:30.472 --> 00:14:31.555
Rudi.

109
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.597
- Tell Dad what you saw in the forest.
- Not before bedtime!


110
00:14:36.763 --> 00:14:37.972
Stay out of it!

111
00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:40.138
It's OK, I can take him.

112
00:14:40.597 --> 00:14:42.472
It's all good now, OK?

113
00:14:42.638 --> 00:14:45.347
Dad's home.
There's nothing to be scared of.


114
00:14:45.513 --> 00:14:46.930
Come to bed.

115
00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:49.847
He doesn't sleep alone anymore?

116
00:14:50.013 --> 00:14:50.930
No.

117
00:14:52.597 --> 00:14:54.513
You're not helping him.

118
00:14:56.388 --> 00:14:59.347
He wets the bed if he sleeps alone.

119
00:15:01.763 --> 00:15:03.847
Have you seen Papa Otto?

120
00:15:04.763 --> 00:15:06.722
No, I came straight here.

121
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.347
You should, he's not doing well.

122
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.972
Goodnight.

123
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.847
Did that guy scare you?

124
00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:32.347
What's your business here?

125
00:15:33.763 --> 00:15:35.513
I asked you something!

126
00:15:37.222 --> 00:15:38.763
Are you here stealing?

127
00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:41.097
Tell me!

128
00:15:43.388 --> 00:15:45.597
I don't want to see you around!

129
00:15:45.847 --> 00:15:47.597
Scaring children...

130
00:15:47.805 --> 00:15:48.680
Damn bastard.

131
00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:50.055
Come, Rudi.

132
00:15:55.013 --> 00:15:56.680
Here's your schoolbag.

133
00:16:01.513 --> 00:16:03.513
You go alone from here on.

134
00:16:10.347 --> 00:16:12.097
Keep going, I'm watching!

135
00:16:16.555 --> 00:16:17.763
Keep going!

136
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.680
That's it, good!

137
00:16:25.722 --> 00:16:27.222
Why didn't you get it?

138
00:16:27.388 --> 00:16:28.722
Sissy!

139
00:16:29.222 --> 00:16:31.430
Hey, what was that?

140
00:16:32.138 --> 00:16:35.263
I'm not having that here!
Next time, you'll do push-ups!


141
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.680
- You're back?
- Since last night.


142
00:16:38.847 --> 00:16:40.513
Come later for a drink.

143
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.263
Matthias, how are you?

144
00:16:42.597 --> 00:16:44.805
Back for good or just for Christmas?

145
00:16:44.972 --> 00:16:46.638
Not sure, I'll see.

146
00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:49.347
- You had a three-year contract?
- Two-year.


147
00:16:49.513 --> 00:16:52.763
Forgive me for asking
when you've just come back,


148
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.055
but would you kill my pig?

149
00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:59.347
The one who did the job after you left
made a mess of it.


150
00:16:59.513 --> 00:17:01.513
I gave away my tools when I left.

151
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.138
No worries,
we can find a good knife.


152
00:17:04.305 --> 00:17:07.263
- When?
- Today is fine, if you can.


153
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.721
- I'll try to make it.
- Good man.


154
00:17:13.638 --> 00:17:16.263
In Bradu they only want four today.

155
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.805
- And for Topliţa?
- Two. Thanks.


156
00:17:20.638 --> 00:17:25.305
If you don't want them, tell me now.
A bakery in Năvodari is interested.


157
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.971
OK, we'll take these three,

158
00:17:28.138 --> 00:17:30.305
but I hope to find two more locally.

159
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:32.221
- When's your deadline?
- The 7th.


160
00:17:32.388 --> 00:17:33.596
Of January?

161
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.305
You expect to find two more,
over the holidays and for this money?


162
00:17:38.472 --> 00:17:41.180
You never know with foreigners,
plus the lodging...


163
00:17:41.347 --> 00:17:43.055
"You never know"?

164
00:17:43.388 --> 00:17:46.805
They're ten times more decent
and settle for less.


165
00:17:46.972 --> 00:17:48.347
- Asians?
- Yes.


166
00:17:48.513 --> 00:17:50.597
We don't even work with Africa.

167
00:17:51.013 --> 00:17:53.847
- We'll consider it.
- When can they get here?


168
00:17:54.013 --> 00:17:57.138
Two can come tomorrow.
I have them in Bucharest.


169
00:17:57.597 --> 00:17:59.638
Can't talk now. 
I'll call back.

170
00:18:00.055 --> 00:18:01.305
Excuse me.

171
00:18:05.722 --> 00:18:06.763
Hi.

172
00:18:08.138 --> 00:18:11.847
- You lost some serious weight!
- I haven't, it's just the clothes.


173
00:18:12.388 --> 00:18:14.222
You don't have a smoking corner?

174
00:18:14.388 --> 00:18:17.180
- We don't have any smokers.
- No smokers?


175
00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.763
- Just go ahead.
- Won't she fire you?


176
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.888
- Who?
- Your boss lady.


177
00:18:22.055 --> 00:18:23.472
I'm the boss.

178
00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:26.097
Bravo! It's all yours?

179
00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:29.180
It's the owner's, but I'm the boss.

180
00:18:31.472 --> 00:18:35.097
- You said you weren't coming back.
- Something came up.


181
00:18:35.263 --> 00:18:38.388
Why did you call me?
What did we agree on?


182
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.763
It's urgent, about Rudi.
I'd like Tánczo to see him.


183
00:18:42.013 --> 00:18:45.138
- Why not call him?
- He changed his number.


184
00:18:46.305 --> 00:18:48.305
So it wasn't me you were calling.

185
00:18:48.472 --> 00:18:49.888
How so?

186
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.513
We've been divorced for two years,
Tánczo and I.


187
00:18:55.888 --> 00:18:57.722
I thought you knew.

188
00:18:58.055 --> 00:19:00.305
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.


189
00:19:01.097 --> 00:19:02.513
And Tánczo?

190
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.388
No idea, in Hungary I guess.

191
00:19:05.597 --> 00:19:07.305
Anyway, he left.

192
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.222
What's the problem with Rudi?

193
00:19:09.388 --> 00:19:11.513
I'm not sure, he won't speak.

194
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.722
Can't be good, anyway.

195
00:19:15.347 --> 00:19:17.180
So you'll stay a while?

196
00:19:17.555 --> 00:19:19.638
I guess so, I don't know.

197
00:19:20.138 --> 00:19:22.805
- Any work to be found?
- Not really.


198
00:19:23.138 --> 00:19:24.805
Will they reopen the mine?

199
00:19:24.972 --> 00:19:27.430
I doubt it. Try the Forest Authority.

200
00:19:27.805 --> 00:19:29.388
Yeah, right.

201
00:19:29.888 --> 00:19:32.722
Or, if you're interested,
we're looking for bakers.


202
00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:34.555
What's the pay?

203
00:19:34.722 --> 00:19:37.972
Minimum wage,
but overtime gets doubled.


204
00:19:38.138 --> 00:19:41.013
- "Doubled"?
- Paid double, you know.


205
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.638
I'll think about it.

206
00:19:42.888 --> 00:19:45.097
Think quick, they'll get taken.

207
00:19:45.305 --> 00:19:47.138
Still living in the same place?

208
00:19:47.305 --> 00:19:50.680
I moved into my parents' house.
I renovated it.


209
00:19:50.888 --> 00:19:52.347
You renovated...

210
00:19:57.763 --> 00:20:00.055
- I'll go in, I'm freezing.
- OK, bye.


211
00:20:31.638 --> 00:20:34.138
Papa? Are you alright?

212
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.513
Up you go.

213
00:20:42.847 --> 00:20:44.097
And out.

214
00:21:10.222 --> 00:21:12.888
Don't get up before I get back, alright?

215
00:21:17.638 --> 00:21:22.138
Here, Coliner.
For cerebral circulation, ten drops.


216
00:21:23.263 --> 00:21:26.347
He'd need a checkup in town,
I can't do much.


217
00:21:26.513 --> 00:21:27.597
A checkup?

218
00:21:27.805 --> 00:21:31.055
Yes, for diagnosis.
At his age, it could be many things.


219
00:21:31.222 --> 00:21:34.555
- And no bending down with sheep.
- Yeah, right.


220
00:21:34.722 --> 00:21:37.138
He's not fit for it, he must understand.

221
00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:40.805
- He needs looking after.
- Steffi's checking on him.


222
00:21:40.972 --> 00:21:42.972
I mean daily.

223
00:21:43.555 --> 00:21:47.638
Someone needs to give him his meds,
wash him, be with him.


224
00:21:47.805 --> 00:21:50.388
- Do you know anyone?
- In the village?


225
00:21:50.555 --> 00:21:52.555
Everyone's away working.

226
00:21:52.888 --> 00:21:55.263
Hard to find people for any job.

227
00:21:57.097 --> 00:22:01.055
He has a harder time speaking, too.
Harder than usual.


228
00:22:01.388 --> 00:22:02.763
Possibly.

229
00:22:03.513 --> 00:22:06.263
- Can this thing be passed down?
- What?


230
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.013
These speech defects.

231
00:22:10.138 --> 00:22:11.180
Hardly.

232
00:22:11.347 --> 00:22:14.305
You know Germans here
used to intermarry.


233
00:22:14.472 --> 00:22:18.013
- You speak just fine.
- I meant Rudi.


234
00:22:18.347 --> 00:22:19.972
What, he doesn't speak?

235
00:22:20.388 --> 00:22:21.513
Not really.

236
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.513
That needs looking into.

237
00:22:24.555 --> 00:22:26.638
Here's the referral.

238
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.055
Have a neurologist in Cluj check him up.

239
00:22:31.888 --> 00:22:32.930
Thank you.

240
00:22:47.013 --> 00:22:48.305
Here you are.

241
00:22:50.013 --> 00:22:51.263
Thank you.

242
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.513
- No, I don't...
- Drink, you're a man now!


243
00:22:56.972 --> 00:22:59.680
- Did you give the pig a drink?
- Mom did.


244
00:22:59.847 --> 00:23:01.513
I poured him some on bread.

245
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.805
Cheers!

246
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.013
Well then.

247
00:23:15.847 --> 00:23:17.472
- Hold it.
- I'm not touching that.


248
00:23:17.638 --> 00:23:18.888
You hold it.

249
00:23:19.763 --> 00:23:21.013
Pass the knife!

250
00:23:21.222 --> 00:23:22.888
Hilt first!

251
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.138
Hold on!

252
00:23:24.305 --> 00:23:26.305
Hold it down!

253
00:23:26.513 --> 00:23:28.430
Hold it, it's getting away!

254
00:23:35.513 --> 00:23:37.222
Put it down.

255
00:23:38.305 --> 00:23:39.888
There, hold it!

256
00:24:37.972 --> 00:24:39.847
Don't be scared, it's me.

257
00:24:40.263 --> 00:24:42.263
What the hell are you doing here?

258
00:24:42.722 --> 00:24:45.597
I killed the Reverend's pig
and he gave me some meat.


259
00:24:45.763 --> 00:24:46.847
So?

260
00:24:48.513 --> 00:24:51.305
I brought you some.
Are you keeping the fast?


261
00:24:51.513 --> 00:24:53.972
Me? No.
But I've stopped eating meat.


262
00:24:54.472 --> 00:24:56.847
- You stopped eating meat?
- Yes.


263
00:25:01.263 --> 00:25:02.847
So what are you doing?

264
00:25:03.347 --> 00:25:05.180
For Christmas, I mean.

265
00:25:05.805 --> 00:25:07.305
Watching films.

266
00:25:07.763 --> 00:25:08.847
Watching films?

267
00:25:09.222 --> 00:25:10.013
Yes.

268
00:25:11.722 --> 00:25:13.055
I don't know...

269
00:25:13.763 --> 00:25:16.555
Christmas feels like
the worst time to be alone.


270
00:25:17.263 --> 00:25:19.763
- Don't you have your family?
- No, I...


271
00:25:20.013 --> 00:25:21.722
I meant you.

272
00:25:22.055 --> 00:25:23.680
I have Kaiser.

273
00:25:23.847 --> 00:25:25.097
You have Kaiser...

274
00:25:29.472 --> 00:25:31.180
I just wanted to say...

275
00:25:31.972 --> 00:25:34.180
I can't take that job at the bakery.

276
00:25:34.555 --> 00:25:35.555
I see.

277
00:25:35.722 --> 00:25:39.472
- I'd rather not work than...
- Alright. Now go home.


278
00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:42.388
I'm in no hurry. 
Rudi's asleep already.

279
00:25:43.013 --> 00:25:46.805
- Maybe your wife's waiting with dinner.
- She's not.


280
00:25:47.305 --> 00:25:49.513
Anyway, go get some rest.

281
00:25:49.888 --> 00:25:52.555
- I'm not drunk, you know.
- Maybe not, but...


282
00:25:53.347 --> 00:25:56.555
And please don't come
around the back door, alright?


283
00:25:58.972 --> 00:26:00.013
Not around the back door?

284
00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.680
Either the front or not at all.

285
00:26:04.847 --> 00:26:07.555
Go home now, we'll talk tomorrow.

286
00:26:10.847 --> 00:26:12.013
Goodnight.

287
00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:14.888
Goodnight.

288
00:26:24.097 --> 00:26:25.180
Rudi?

289
00:26:37.138 --> 00:26:38.680
What are you doing?

290
00:26:39.722 --> 00:26:41.513
Going to school.

291
00:26:41.805 --> 00:26:44.305
- Isn't he going alone today?
- No he's not.


292
00:26:44.972 --> 00:26:46.305
Yes he is.

293
00:26:46.555 --> 00:26:48.847
We went together yesterday.
That's it.


294
00:26:49.013 --> 00:26:49.972
He's scared!

295
00:26:50.138 --> 00:26:52.180
Rudi, you mustn't be scared.

296
00:26:52.347 --> 00:26:55.638
- You're not hitting him!
- I won't, crazy woman.


297
00:26:55.972 --> 00:26:57.055
Rudi!

298
00:26:59.638 --> 00:27:00.930
Come to Papa.

299
00:27:01.347 --> 00:27:03.805
Come on down
and tell Dad what you saw.


300
00:27:04.013 --> 00:27:05.972
Something bad, he says.

301
00:27:06.305 --> 00:27:08.347
- Something bad?
- Yes.


302
00:27:09.305 --> 00:27:11.013
You took him to a doctor?

303
00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.180
It's Christmas. What doctor?

304
00:27:13.347 --> 00:27:15.972
I spoke with the Reverend,
I'll take him on Sunday.


305
00:27:16.138 --> 00:27:17.555
With the Reverend.

306
00:27:17.722 --> 00:27:21.055
Rudi, come down. Dad's coming along.
We'll take the rifle.


307
00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:23.763
I'll go get the rifle, you come down.

308
00:27:26.472 --> 00:27:27.805
Come down, Rudi.

309
00:27:43.513 --> 00:27:44.597
Rudi.

310
00:27:45.722 --> 00:27:46.930
Look there.

311
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.638
See the bear?

312
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.638
There, in the bushes.

313
00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:02.638
We'll just scare him, then.

314
00:28:02.805 --> 00:28:04.972
So you won't be afraid anymore.

315
00:28:14.722 --> 00:28:15.972
All good?

316
00:28:16.138 --> 00:28:17.180
Let's go.

317
00:28:42.013 --> 00:28:43.305
Hello!

318
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.347
Please, come, come.

319
00:28:46.805 --> 00:28:48.013
Alick.

320
00:28:49.472 --> 00:28:50.555
Mahinda.

321
00:28:50.722 --> 00:28:52.388
Please, take a...

322
00:28:52.555 --> 00:28:53.555
Hi.

323
00:28:57.055 --> 00:28:58.055
Mahinda.

324
00:28:58.222 --> 00:28:59.305
Hi, Csilla.

325
00:28:59.472 --> 00:29:00.722
And Alick.

326
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.013
Sorry you've had to come
before Christmas.


327
00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.013
Work first, always.

328
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.347
- Where are they from?
- Where are they from?


329
00:29:14.513 --> 00:29:15.847
Sri Lanka.

330
00:29:16.472 --> 00:29:20.930
Explain the workflow,
but keep it short, they must be tired.


331
00:29:21.097 --> 00:29:22.763
We'll do the training tomorrow.

332
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:26.263
- I'll need a signature.
- Let's get the paperwork done.


333
00:29:46.888 --> 00:29:49.722
Here three shepherds keep
Their three flocks of sheep,


334
00:29:49.888 --> 00:29:54.388
One Moldavian,
one Transylvanian, one Muntean.


335
00:29:55.013 --> 00:29:57.847
Now, the Muntean
and the Transylvanian


336
00:29:58.013 --> 00:30:01.263
In their thoughts, conniving,
Have laid plans contriving...


337
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:03.763
At the close of day
To ambush and slay


338
00:30:03.972 --> 00:30:06.680
The Moldavian;
He, the wealthier one,


339
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:10.888
Had more flocks to keep,
Handsome, long-horned sheep,


340
00:30:11.263 --> 00:30:15.180
Horses, trained and sound,
And the fiercest hounds.


341
00:30:15.888 --> 00:30:19.722
One small ewe-lamb, though,
Dappled gray as tow


342
00:30:20.138 --> 00:30:24.513
While three full days passed
Bleated loud and fast.


343
00:30:56.347 --> 00:30:58.013
Happy holidays!

344
00:30:59.013 --> 00:31:00.888
Mr. Baciu, hello!

345
00:31:01.263 --> 00:31:02.263
Not bad!

346
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.055
Happy holidays!

347
00:31:04.513 --> 00:31:06.972
Merry Christmas!
Lovely singing!


348
00:31:07.513 --> 00:31:08.555
Why hello!

349
00:31:08.722 --> 00:31:10.347
It was lovely!

350
00:31:10.513 --> 00:31:12.597
Thank you for the children's gifts!

351
00:31:12.763 --> 00:31:14.513
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.


352
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.138
It was Santa!

353
00:31:16.513 --> 00:31:19.513
- Matthias told him there's no Santa.
- No point in delusions.


354
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.597
Such a pity!

355
00:31:20.763 --> 00:31:24.722
Mrs. Baciu, would you rent us your rooms
for some new workers?


356
00:31:24.888 --> 00:31:26.055
Of course.

357
00:31:26.222 --> 00:31:28.888
- They'll need wood for heating.
- Yes, they need wood.


358
00:31:29.055 --> 00:31:30.763
- Woods is no problem.
- "Wood"...


359
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.930
Can Csilla sort out the details
with you today? It's urgent.


360
00:31:35.097 --> 00:31:37.430
- Please drop by.
- Thank you.


361
00:31:37.763 --> 00:31:40.222
- Happy holidays!
- All the best!


362
00:32:14.013 --> 00:32:15.180
Come here.

363
00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:21.930
Put that stick back.

364
00:32:22.722 --> 00:32:23.513
There.

365
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.263
Push it in properly!

366
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.013
Cover it with leaves.

367
00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.388
Leave the meat in plain sight.

368
00:33:39.305 --> 00:33:42.263
Drinking this might kill you.
It's full of filth.


369
00:33:43.222 --> 00:33:44.763
From the mine.

370
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.805
Still, it's water.

371
00:33:47.513 --> 00:33:50.930
Apparently, Papa Otto's ancestors
are buried nearby.


372
00:33:51.763 --> 00:33:54.555
They came from around Luxembourg.

373
00:33:55.513 --> 00:33:57.930
About 700 years ago.

374
00:34:00.263 --> 00:34:02.097
You know where Luxembourg is?

375
00:34:03.513 --> 00:34:05.138
Near Germany.

376
00:34:07.555 --> 00:34:09.430
I'll show you how to clean your water.

377
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.013
You know what this is?

378
00:34:34.347 --> 00:34:35.680
Birch.

379
00:34:38.222 --> 00:34:41.388
In spring I'll teach you
which plants you can eat.


380
00:34:44.805 --> 00:34:45.847
Try it.

381
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:53.680
Sure, it doesn't taste good,
but you can drink it.


382
00:34:55.013 --> 00:34:58.597
If you can make a fire and boil water,
you'll live.


383
00:34:59.013 --> 00:35:01.763
To survive,
you need to know one more thing.


384
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.638
How to fight.

385
00:35:04.013 --> 00:35:05.347
It's not hard.

386
00:35:05.513 --> 00:35:07.430
You just have not to feel pity.

387
00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:10.513
You think invaders around here
felt pity?


388
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.638
That's life.

389
00:35:14.597 --> 00:35:17.930
People who feel pity die first.
I want you to die last.


390
00:35:18.097 --> 00:35:19.513
Let's go.

391
00:35:25.347 --> 00:35:27.638
Wash your hands.

392
00:35:30.138 --> 00:35:33.097
The bakery brought such nice presents.

393
00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.347
Listen.

394
00:35:36.263 --> 00:35:38.180
Have you talked to Csilla?

395
00:35:38.972 --> 00:35:40.347
To Csilla?

396
00:35:40.722 --> 00:35:42.513
Since you got back.

397
00:35:44.555 --> 00:35:45.972
What's that?

398
00:35:46.347 --> 00:35:48.097
Santa's coat.

399
00:35:48.305 --> 00:35:50.638
- He made it.
- He did?


400
00:35:51.263 --> 00:35:54.263
- He can crochet now.
- He's a boy, what the hell?


401
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.055
Language, please.

402
00:35:56.222 --> 00:35:58.722
And no fighting at the table.

403
00:36:01.847 --> 00:36:05.597
The poor shall eat and be satisfied

404
00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:08.138
and they who seek
the Lord shall praise him,


405
00:36:08.305 --> 00:36:10.305
their hearts shall live
to the ages of ages.


406
00:36:10.763 --> 00:36:11.930
Amen.

407
00:36:14.555 --> 00:36:15.763
Enjoy.

408
00:36:16.097 --> 00:36:17.055
Enjoy.

409
00:36:32.888 --> 00:36:34.805
- Want a beer?
- No.


410
00:36:35.097 --> 00:36:37.347
Let's hear it, I'm sleepy.

411
00:36:38.013 --> 00:36:39.888
What's with the tone?

412
00:36:40.055 --> 00:36:42.180
- What tone?
- That one!


413
00:36:42.638 --> 00:36:44.388
I had to wake up for this?

414
00:36:44.555 --> 00:36:47.097
And I came back to hear that
from you?


415
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.555
I don't know why you came back.

416
00:36:50.013 --> 00:36:51.347
What do you think?

417
00:36:51.513 --> 00:36:54.388
None of my business.
You're free to come and go.


418
00:36:54.555 --> 00:36:55.805
And Rudi?

419
00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:59.222
I let you know,
but I told you I'd take care of things.


420
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.930
How exactly?

421
00:37:01.097 --> 00:37:02.347
Meaning?

422
00:37:02.513 --> 00:37:05.013
Still sleeping with him at eight?

423
00:37:05.222 --> 00:37:06.680
He's a child.

424
00:37:06.847 --> 00:37:09.638
You're keeping him dependent on you!

425
00:37:09.805 --> 00:37:10.763
Nonsense.

426
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.180
You teach him crochet instead of German!

427
00:37:13.347 --> 00:37:15.305
Crochet is soothing and recommended.

428
00:37:15.472 --> 00:37:18.305
Recommended?
You want to raise a sissy?


429
00:37:18.513 --> 00:37:20.597
He has to kill
animals to be a man?

430
00:37:20.763 --> 00:37:22.638
He has to be strong,
or he'll get trampled!


431
00:37:22.805 --> 00:37:26.347
- He will be.
- How? He's the classroom idiot!


432
00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.472
- I worked like a dog there...
- It wasn't for me.


433
00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.763
Watch that mouth!

434
00:37:33.055 --> 00:37:34.388
Or what?

435
00:37:34.597 --> 00:37:37.263
Raise your hand again and I'm leaving.

436
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.180
Go ahead.

437
00:37:38.347 --> 00:37:41.847
- Taking the boy too.
- He will grow up in my house!


438
00:37:42.138 --> 00:37:43.222
Your house?

439
00:37:43.388 --> 00:37:46.097
Try to take this child from me
and I'll kill you.


440
00:37:46.263 --> 00:37:47.680
Understood?

441
00:37:53.513 --> 00:37:54.763
Stop it!

442
00:37:56.388 --> 00:37:58.972
You can go back to your sweetheart.

443
00:38:00.472 --> 00:38:03.597
Don't come here to sleep
if you're going to act like this.


444
00:38:03.763 --> 00:38:07.180
And if you want me and Rudi
to stay in this house.


445
00:39:10.055 --> 00:39:11.472
Sit, Kaiser!

446
00:41:32.513 --> 00:41:34.763
It's the bakery people.

447
00:41:40.513 --> 00:41:45.138
Aura, bring the cabbage, please.
And the polenta.


448
00:41:46.597 --> 00:41:48.222
I thought you said Japanese.

449
00:41:48.388 --> 00:41:52.597
First he said Chinese, then Nepalese,
now they're Sri Lankan.


450
00:41:54.388 --> 00:41:56.263
- There it is.
- Excellent.


451
00:42:01.263 --> 00:42:03.263
Can they make a fire, though?

452
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.513
I guess. If not, they'll learn.

453
00:42:05.805 --> 00:42:08.597
- Come sit down for lunch.
- Oh no, on Christmas Day!


454
00:42:08.763 --> 00:42:10.638
I won't hear it!

455
00:42:10.805 --> 00:42:12.888
What about them?
Do they eat pork?


456
00:42:18.263 --> 00:42:21.347
Excuse me,
but to you, the world is the West.


457
00:42:21.513 --> 00:42:23.388
Beyond, you only see raw materials.

458
00:42:23.555 --> 00:42:24.388
Colonies.

459
00:42:24.555 --> 00:42:26.222
- You exaggerate.
- Not at all!


460
00:42:26.388 --> 00:42:29.888
We know your history well.
Ana can confirm.


461
00:42:30.055 --> 00:42:33.847
But you know nothing about the East.

462
00:42:34.097 --> 00:42:37.638
Not all of us,
but history is written by the strongest.


463
00:42:37.805 --> 00:42:42.763
Sure, but you became strong
and built great cathedrals


464
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.513
because we here
fought off the invaders.


465
00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.180
The Mongols, the Avars...

466
00:42:49.347 --> 00:42:50.972
The Huns, who were the worst.

467
00:42:51.138 --> 00:42:52.138
Yes, the Huns.

468
00:42:52.305 --> 00:42:55.597
See the map, Romania has always
been squeezed between empires.


469
00:42:55.763 --> 00:42:58.347
The Ottoman, the Russian, the Hungarian.

470
00:42:58.513 --> 00:43:01.430
And we stood fast
for two thousand years.


471
00:43:01.638 --> 00:43:03.638
Also because we won two world wars.

472
00:43:03.805 --> 00:43:06.472
- Then left us to the Russians.
- No more politics!


473
00:43:06.638 --> 00:43:08.805
Aura, take some cabbage to the guests.

474
00:43:08.972 --> 00:43:11.597
- So sorry to bother you.
- Nonsense, sit down.


475
00:43:11.763 --> 00:43:12.722
Hi.

476
00:43:13.763 --> 00:43:15.222
Nothing for me, please.

477
00:43:15.388 --> 00:43:16.847
At least dessert!

478
00:43:17.013 --> 00:43:20.013
- I can't say no to sweets.
- Me neither.


479
00:43:20.972 --> 00:43:23.305
- Mara, has Santa stopped by?
- Yes.


480
00:43:23.472 --> 00:43:26.597
- So you've been good.
- She's the best.


481
00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:29.888
- Come to rehearsals when you can.
- She's in the choir.


482
00:43:30.055 --> 00:43:33.638
I heard. At school.
But playing an instrument helps.


483
00:43:33.972 --> 00:43:35.430
- Some wine?
- I'm driving.


484
00:43:35.597 --> 00:43:36.847
Make room!

485
00:43:37.972 --> 00:43:40.138
I haven't introduced you to Mr. Ben.

486
00:43:40.305 --> 00:43:42.180
- Csilla.
- Nice to meet you.


487
00:43:43.138 --> 00:43:47.180
He's from a French NGO for conservation.
Bears and stuff.


488
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:02.347
- I cut you off.
- It's alright.


489
00:44:03.138 --> 00:44:06.680
True, Transylvania is beautiful,
but it's not a country.


490
00:44:07.013 --> 00:44:10.055
Country, region...
it's all the same in Europe.


491
00:44:10.222 --> 00:44:12.472
You could say we're all brothers.

492
00:44:12.638 --> 00:44:15.347
But around here we have a saying:

493
00:44:15.513 --> 00:44:18.513
"Brother, brother,
but cheese is for money!"


494
00:44:20.638 --> 00:44:22.180
She learned that in school.

495
00:44:23.805 --> 00:44:25.513
Upstairs.

496
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.847
The mayor asked,
it's part of their contract with the EU.


497
00:44:29.013 --> 00:44:30.847
So you found workers?

498
00:44:31.013 --> 00:44:34.597
It's been terrible,
all those ads and no one wanted to come.


499
00:44:34.763 --> 00:44:36.680
Everyone's working abroad.

500
00:44:36.847 --> 00:44:38.388
Our economy's in a shambles.

501
00:44:38.555 --> 00:44:40.722
- I even asked Matthias.
- What?


502
00:44:40.888 --> 00:44:42.638
If I wanted to be a baker.

503
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.930
He'll go back to Germany,
now he has a life there.


504
00:44:46.097 --> 00:44:47.763
We'll see about that.

505
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.763
The boy hasn't learned
any German since I left.


506
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:55.138
It's fine, they learn so fast
when they have to manage!


507
00:44:55.305 --> 00:44:58.013
He will learn what he needs to learn.

508
00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.347
Excuse me, I need to go see Papa Otto,
he's bedridden.


509
00:45:03.513 --> 00:45:06.638
Good, no one should be alone
on Christmas Day.


510
00:45:06.805 --> 00:45:09.347
Only we got used to
working around the clock.


511
00:45:09.513 --> 00:45:12.263
Good thing, too.
People need bread every day.


512
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.847
Pack some sarmale for our in-law!

513
00:45:15.013 --> 00:45:16.638
Already taken care of.

514
00:45:16.805 --> 00:45:18.222
What is this?

515
00:45:19.097 --> 00:45:20.972
- Cozonac.
- Cake.


516
00:45:21.888 --> 00:45:24.180
- And what is this?
- Apple tart.


517
00:45:24.347 --> 00:45:25.763
Want some cozonac?

518
00:45:27.472 --> 00:45:28.805
May I?

519
00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:01.430
You have nine sheep.
But I think you had just nine.


520
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.263
Papa?

521
00:48:39.097 --> 00:48:42.722
Hi, I'm at the hospital with Papa Otto.

522
00:48:42.888 --> 00:48:46.097
So I can't make it tonight, sorry.

523
00:49:13.305 --> 00:49:15.847
They seem to know what they're doing.

524
00:49:16.013 --> 00:49:17.472
That would be great.

525
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.888
We could go up to 800 cozonaci,
deliver to Topliţa.


526
00:49:22.305 --> 00:49:25.013
Should I give the go-ahead
for the other two?


527
00:49:26.013 --> 00:49:27.805
Or should we wait?

528
00:49:28.013 --> 00:49:29.972
Applications will close.

529
00:49:31.388 --> 00:49:35.597
You're right, let's do it.
At worst, we lose the guaranty.


530
00:49:36.097 --> 00:49:37.972
Did you get them presents?

531
00:49:38.138 --> 00:49:41.680
Everyone gets one.
I invited them to the party, too.


532
00:50:20.555 --> 00:50:22.305
How's the old man?

533
00:50:24.222 --> 00:50:26.180
There's beer inside.

534
00:50:42.347 --> 00:50:43.847
I'd like a beer.

535
00:51:08.513 --> 00:51:10.263
When can you take him home?

536
00:51:11.013 --> 00:51:12.555
We're waiting for the tests.

537
00:51:12.722 --> 00:51:14.013
What's his problem?

538
00:51:14.222 --> 00:51:15.680
Something in his head.

539
00:51:15.847 --> 00:51:17.055
Sucks.

540
00:51:17.722 --> 00:51:21.680
Turns out he wasn't gaga,
his sheep really are going missing.


541
00:51:21.847 --> 00:51:23.680
Could be a bear?

542
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:27.138
- Can you even leave now?
- I'll wait and see.


543
00:51:27.347 --> 00:51:30.222
- Won't you lose the contract?
- Even so.


544
00:51:30.388 --> 00:51:33.347
- Any jobs around here?
- Not really.


545
00:51:33.972 --> 00:51:35.888
Anything in Forestry?

546
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.847
They've logged all they could,
and when they move, they hire locals.


547
00:51:40.013 --> 00:51:41.388
Saves on rent.

548
00:51:41.555 --> 00:51:43.472
Fucking Austrian shits!

549
00:51:44.222 --> 00:51:45.305
All done?

550
00:51:45.472 --> 00:51:46.305
Done.

551
00:51:46.472 --> 00:51:48.263
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.


552
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:51.430
- Happy holidays!
- Same to you, bye.


553
00:51:54.805 --> 00:51:56.305
Gypsies again.

554
00:51:56.472 --> 00:51:58.722
Seen some in the forest.

555
00:51:59.013 --> 00:52:00.472
Those aren't Gypsies.

556
00:52:00.638 --> 00:52:04.013
The bakery hired them.
Nepalese or something.


557
00:52:04.305 --> 00:52:06.222
Making black bread!

558
00:52:06.388 --> 00:52:08.513
Couldn't they have hired locals?

559
00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.388
On minimum wage?

560
00:52:11.847 --> 00:52:15.347
People go away for work,
children get left behind.


561
00:52:15.513 --> 00:52:18.055
Fuck them and their wages!

562
00:52:19.222 --> 00:52:20.847
Oi, gringo!

563
00:52:21.847 --> 00:52:23.972
Come over for a chat.

564
00:52:24.513 --> 00:52:25.638
Move!

565
00:52:26.555 --> 00:52:28.888
Not coming, huh? Too scared?

566
00:52:30.055 --> 00:52:33.097
Hey, what if they nabbed your sheep?

567
00:52:33.263 --> 00:52:35.305
You know they don't eat pork.

568
00:52:35.472 --> 00:52:37.513
You coming to cheer for the team?

569
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.805
- Who are we playing?
- Bradu.


570
00:52:39.972 --> 00:52:42.013
We'll fuck those Gypsies over!

571
00:52:42.722 --> 00:52:44.972
What? You're mostly German.

572
00:52:45.138 --> 00:52:48.472
He's neither, he's a bit of a mongrel.

573
00:52:49.847 --> 00:52:52.055
Can you take Rudi in the hockey team?

574
00:52:52.222 --> 00:52:53.972
He'd have to want to come.

575
00:52:54.138 --> 00:52:56.680
Bring him to the
game, he might like it.

576
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:58.888
What, another one?

577
00:52:59.888 --> 00:53:02.930
We got rid of Gypsies,
now those start breeding here!


578
00:53:03.472 --> 00:53:06.180
- He was dancing with your sister.
- No shit!


579
00:53:08.097 --> 00:53:09.722
- I'm off.
- See you.


580
00:53:10.013 --> 00:53:12.222
- For real?
- Told you, man.


581
00:53:12.388 --> 00:53:13.555
Fucking cockroaches,

582
00:53:13.722 --> 00:53:17.597
wait 'til I get my hands on you!

583
00:54:16.805 --> 00:54:18.805
Why can't you tell me
you love me?


584
00:54:20.555 --> 00:54:22.263
No, in Romanian.

585
00:54:23.013 --> 00:54:24.472
I don't know.

586
00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.513
It sounds weird.

587
00:54:27.847 --> 00:54:31.180
What, for such a strong guy like you?

588
00:54:33.472 --> 00:54:35.722
I can say it in Hungarian.

589
00:54:36.388 --> 00:54:37.513
Go on.

590
00:54:38.305 --> 00:54:39.513
Say it.

591
00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.013
How do you say it?

592
00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:45.513
Jó étvágyat.

593
00:54:50.388 --> 00:54:52.680
Jó étvágyat mucho.

594
00:54:57.305 --> 00:54:59.513
- What's in the bag?
- Which one?


595
00:55:00.888 --> 00:55:02.013
That one.

596
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:05.555
Stuff.

597
00:55:05.888 --> 00:55:07.347
What stuff?

598
00:55:07.847 --> 00:55:09.388
A toothbrush,

599
00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:11.388
stuff like that.

600
00:55:11.555 --> 00:55:14.222
You can't tell me you love me
but you're moving in?


601
00:55:14.388 --> 00:55:15.972
I did tell you I love you.

602
00:55:16.972 --> 00:55:18.347
Say it again.

603
00:55:19.097 --> 00:55:20.805
Jó étvágyat.

604
00:55:21.847 --> 00:55:23.888
That's "enjoy your meal".

605
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.013
I love you.

606
00:55:33.222 --> 00:55:36.222
- What's with the rifle?
- I brought it to you.


607
00:55:36.888 --> 00:55:38.097
What for?

608
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:41.847
To have it around.
You live by the forest.


609
00:55:42.013 --> 00:55:43.930
We all live by the forest.

610
00:55:46.347 --> 00:55:48.180
Why not leave it for Ana?

611
00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.805
She doesn't love me.

612
00:55:50.972 --> 00:55:52.513
And I do?

613
00:55:53.388 --> 00:55:54.680
Don't you?

614
00:55:56.222 --> 00:55:57.888
Can I ask for a favor?

615
00:55:58.055 --> 00:55:58.722
Yes, baby.

616
00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:00.222
For tomorrow.

617
00:56:01.138 --> 00:56:03.805
Can you go to the train station
in Bicaz?


618
00:56:05.513 --> 00:56:08.430
And I don't want you
to stay over tonight.


619
00:56:08.805 --> 00:56:10.138
When, then?

620
00:56:11.097 --> 00:56:12.597
I don't know when.

621
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:24.013
So?

622
00:56:24.722 --> 00:56:25.847
When?

623
00:56:26.388 --> 00:56:27.430
Tomorrow?

624
00:56:27.972 --> 00:56:29.305
I don't know.

625
00:56:29.472 --> 00:56:30.388
Tell me.

626
00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.388
When?

627
00:56:33.805 --> 00:56:35.347
Next year?

628
00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.555
Or when hell freezes over?

629
00:57:10.847 --> 00:57:14.680
I sent you a link, open it.

630
00:57:14.847 --> 00:57:16.763
Community Forum

631
00:57:17.013 --> 00:57:18.722
Lynch them all!

632
00:57:18.888 --> 00:57:22.347
Those bastards will do nothing
but rob and murder people!


633
00:57:22.513 --> 00:57:26.138
How would you like it
if Romanians said the same about us?


634
00:57:26.305 --> 00:57:29.930
Accept a single one
and soon they'll be swarming!


635
00:57:30.097 --> 00:57:34.138
They have 10 kids and 3 wives each
and they get EU support!


636
00:57:34.305 --> 00:57:36.013
And they bring disease!

637
00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:38.847
In Germany they get 1,500+ aid!

638
01:00:22.388 --> 01:00:24.597
Thanks, I'll take over from here.

639
01:00:24.763 --> 01:00:26.138
What's this?

640
01:00:26.805 --> 01:00:29.430
For the game tonight.
Are you coming?


641
01:00:29.597 --> 01:00:30.763
I'll see.

642
01:00:31.013 --> 01:00:32.222
See you later.

643
01:00:33.722 --> 01:00:34.847
Hi.

644
01:00:54.138 --> 01:00:55.513
Hold on tight!

645
01:01:03.388 --> 01:01:05.305
Go, Bradu!

646
01:01:06.222 --> 01:01:07.972
Go, Récfalva!

647
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:21.930
You OK?

648
01:01:22.763 --> 01:01:26.597
Smash them, Geza!
Hit them where it hurts!


649
01:01:28.013 --> 01:01:28.972
Go!

650
01:01:29.138 --> 01:01:31.430
Are we equipped for a fight?

651
01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:33.805
Go!

652
01:01:33.972 --> 01:01:36.555
Vlachs, go home!

653
01:01:41.888 --> 01:01:43.472
Dacia!

654
01:01:43.638 --> 01:01:45.347
In freedom!

655
01:02:43.513 --> 01:02:46.013
NO FOREIGNERS IN RECIA!

656
01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:50.763
It's the Hungarians who discriminate.
Kick them out of Romania!


657
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:54.888
Close down
all their native language schools.


658
01:02:55.055 --> 01:02:59.097
Give hate and you get hate.
Europe: homos and slave drivers.


659
01:02:59.263 --> 01:03:02.847
The Hungarians should leave,
not the two foreigners!


660
01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:05.513
Foreigners kick out foreigners, WTF?

661
01:03:41.888 --> 01:03:45.888
May this parish be blessed with health,

662
01:03:46.847 --> 01:03:50.638
may it multiply in the coming year,

663
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:57.347
and may there be some left to carry on
the spirit of our forefathers.


664
01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:00.013
Amen.

665
01:04:27.055 --> 01:04:28.805
How's the old man?

666
01:04:30.222 --> 01:04:33.680
Bring him over to our service,
what's the difference...


667
01:04:33.847 --> 01:04:35.680
- I'll ask him.
- Matthias!


668
01:05:03.305 --> 01:05:04.013
Mr. Felix!

669
01:05:06.222 --> 01:05:07.347
Thanks.

670
01:05:07.888 --> 01:05:09.222
Reverend!

671
01:05:13.513 --> 01:05:16.180
- Please.
- You shouldn't have.


672
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:17.347
Happy New Year.

673
01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.180
Happy New Year!

674
01:05:25.763 --> 01:05:27.555
- Matthias!
- What happened?


675
01:05:27.722 --> 01:05:29.638
- Rudi's gone.
- Gone how?


676
01:05:29.805 --> 01:05:31.805
I can't find him anywhere.

677
01:05:32.263 --> 01:05:33.722
What happened?

678
01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:35.097
I can't find Rudi.

679
01:05:35.263 --> 01:05:36.513
Did you hurt yourself?

680
01:05:38.805 --> 01:05:41.013
Get the first aid kit from the car.

681
01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:45.013
Don't worry, he'll find him.

682
01:05:45.763 --> 01:05:47.305
He'll find him.

683
01:06:20.055 --> 01:06:21.013
Rudi!

684
01:06:26.847 --> 01:06:28.222
Don't get too close!

685
01:06:45.763 --> 01:06:47.597
Stay away...

686
01:06:47.972 --> 01:06:49.763
from wild animals

687
01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:51.472
when you're unarmed.

688
01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:58.597
Happy New Year!

689
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.347
Excuse me.
They just received death threats.


690
01:07:12.513 --> 01:07:13.930
Alick sent me this.

691
01:07:20.305 --> 01:07:21.597
Hold this, please.

692
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:42.637
You have to do something, Reverend.

693
01:08:42.805 --> 01:08:44.930
They are all God's children.

694
01:08:45.097 --> 01:08:48.262
They can be God's children back home.

695
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:52.930
We have nothing against them,
but their place isn't here.


696
01:08:53.847 --> 01:08:56.387
Our people work abroad too.

697
01:08:56.555 --> 01:09:00.680
It's different in town, Reverend,
you get lost in the crowd.


698
01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:05.137
And they work in a bakery,
not in construction.


699
01:09:05.305 --> 01:09:09.305
Frankly, I've stopped buying my bread
from them since.


700
01:09:09.472 --> 01:09:13.680
The problem is,
you can't know about their hygiene.


701
01:09:13.847 --> 01:09:18.637
Their hands are in the bread all day.
Bread that we eat!


702
01:09:18.847 --> 01:09:20.262
It gets baked!

703
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:23.387
- Don't they touch it after?
- Don't they?


704
01:09:23.555 --> 01:09:26.762
They touch it when they unload it,
I've seen it.


705
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:29.930
You think our people don't touch it?

706
01:09:30.762 --> 01:09:35.847
People from other areas
have a different virus pathology,


707
01:09:36.012 --> 01:09:38.097
from a medical standpoint.

708
01:09:38.262 --> 01:09:40.637
One or two wouldn't have been so bad,

709
01:09:40.805 --> 01:09:44.012
but there's three of them now,
when will it stop?


710
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.305
What do you think happened abroad?

711
01:09:46.472 --> 01:09:50.637
They welcomed a few,
now they're swamped in them.


712
01:09:50.805 --> 01:09:53.762
Then they blow themselves up
or run you over!


713
01:09:53.930 --> 01:09:58.180
We barely got rid of the Gypsies,
now we start over, Reverend?


714
01:09:58.347 --> 01:09:59.512
True.

715
01:10:00.222 --> 01:10:03.180
- I'll talk to the bakery people.
- Good, Reverend.


716
01:10:03.347 --> 01:10:06.722
Ask why they don't hire our own folks.

717
01:10:06.888 --> 01:10:10.430
Locals are away working, you know it.

718
01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:14.763
And is that right, Reverend,
our people slaving for others?


719
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:17.138
While our villages fill with their kind?

720
01:10:17.305 --> 01:10:19.305
You've seen Gypsies:

721
01:10:19.472 --> 01:10:22.097
if a house is empty, they settle in.

722
01:10:22.263 --> 01:10:24.763
And who knows
what plans they have!


723
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.763
We're clearly a station
on their way to the West.


724
01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:31.138
Let's not get angry in church.

725
01:10:31.513 --> 01:10:32.555
Reverend,

726
01:10:32.722 --> 01:10:37.972
it's best if you go
and talk about this right away.


727
01:10:38.138 --> 01:10:42.930
There's a handful of us in the village.
We must respect each other.


728
01:10:43.222 --> 01:10:46.555
Very well, I'll go after the service.

729
01:10:47.013 --> 01:10:49.138
We don't want them here.

730
01:10:49.305 --> 01:10:52.180
We're fine with them,
if they stay in their country.


731
01:10:52.347 --> 01:10:54.430
And out of our church!

732
01:10:54.638 --> 01:10:56.805
Before it's too late, Reverend.

733
01:10:56.972 --> 01:11:01.222
Let us all say a prayer now,
and clear our thoughts.


734
01:11:08.888 --> 01:11:10.013
There.

735
01:11:10.347 --> 01:11:12.805
1,500 a month plus lodging.

736
01:11:15.388 --> 01:11:19.097
I'll have to confirm, but he should
be a resident, being half German.


737
01:11:19.263 --> 01:11:22.263
- So he speaks German.
- With an accent, but he does.


738
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:25.722
It's a great plus.
I'll check the ads for butchers.


739
01:11:25.888 --> 01:11:26.763
Please do.

740
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:29.180
And the papers
for the next two candidates?


741
01:11:30.263 --> 01:11:31.347
Here.

742
01:11:32.763 --> 01:11:37.305
Let me know what you decide.
Be quick, they go like hot buns.


743
01:11:37.972 --> 01:11:39.847
- Have a good day.
- You too.


744
01:11:40.013 --> 01:11:42.680
The priest says
he must talk to Mrs. Dénes.


745
01:11:42.847 --> 01:11:43.763
She's busy.

746
01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:45.722
It's about the foreign workers.

747
01:11:45.888 --> 01:11:48.555
People got angry in church.

748
01:11:50.513 --> 01:11:53.805
See their contracts,
they are legal employees, not migrants.


749
01:11:53.972 --> 01:11:57.430
I understand, but people
don't want them in the village.


750
01:11:57.597 --> 01:12:01.180
Am I supposed to throw them out
after hiring them?


751
01:12:01.388 --> 01:12:04.638
Perhaps if you had asked
the community first...


752
01:12:04.805 --> 01:12:08.472
If we had asked?
Those ads were posted for weeks.


753
01:12:08.638 --> 01:12:11.930
We have our own plans,
applying for EU funds.


754
01:12:12.097 --> 01:12:14.513
- Any idea how hard that is?
- I'm sure.


755
01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.138
But I wouldn't want things
to become explosive, you know?


756
01:12:18.305 --> 01:12:19.763
What do you mean?

757
01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:23.722
I'm telling you what people think.
You should consider it.


758
01:12:23.888 --> 01:12:27.805
Did they tell you they created
a Facebook group against them?


759
01:12:27.972 --> 01:12:29.972
And sent them death threats?

760
01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:33.222
- I'm not up to things like Facebook.
- You should be.


761
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:36.763
Who do they bother?
They're family men, good professionals.


762
01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:38.680
They may be good men,

763
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:42.347
but people don't want
to eat the bread they touched.


764
01:12:42.513 --> 01:12:45.097
- Why not?
- They just don't.


765
01:12:45.263 --> 01:12:47.472
Excuse me, Reverend,
this is out of line.


766
01:12:47.638 --> 01:12:52.263
They're not lepers, it's all legal.
That's the end of it!


767
01:12:53.513 --> 01:12:57.138
I think you're doing
the wrong thing, but...


768
01:12:58.638 --> 01:13:01.388
- Praised be.
- God bless.


769
01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.013
Go, go.

770
01:13:08.263 --> 01:13:10.180
Stop. Show him.

771
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:11.638
Throw it.

772
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:13.138
Good, Rudi.

773
01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:14.430
The priest is coming!

774
01:13:14.597 --> 01:13:15.597
Try it again.

775
01:13:26.513 --> 01:13:28.430
What did they say, Reverend?

776
01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:31.805
Sadly, the owner
won't give up the foreign workers.


777
01:13:31.972 --> 01:13:34.097
Speak up!

778
01:13:34.263 --> 01:13:35.222
Crazy woman!

779
01:13:35.388 --> 01:13:39.888
I've explained, but they said
they're earnest, hard-working people.


780
01:13:40.097 --> 01:13:42.430
They can be all that
in their country.


781
01:13:42.597 --> 01:13:47.013
Let's gather signatures
to have them expelled from the village!


782
01:13:47.513 --> 01:13:48.305
Got paper?

783
01:13:48.472 --> 01:13:50.430
You think that's a good idea?

784
01:13:50.597 --> 01:13:53.972
Why not?
We're just speaking our mind.


785
01:15:04.972 --> 01:15:06.680
Breaded chicken...

786
01:15:10.972 --> 01:15:12.347
Good appetite!

787
01:17:55.597 --> 01:17:58.680
Heraus!
Go home or we will kill you!


788
01:17:58.847 --> 01:18:00.180
Kaputt!

789
01:18:11.347 --> 01:18:14.555
You should be ashamed!
Masks off if you're so brave!


790
01:18:14.722 --> 01:18:18.638
You fucked the whole village,
now you suck black cock?


791
01:18:18.805 --> 01:18:20.597
I'll call the police!
I know you!


792
01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:22.597
We know where you live, idiot!

793
01:18:22.763 --> 01:18:24.680
Jancsi, is that you?
I'm calling your dad!


794
01:18:24.847 --> 01:18:27.472
If they don't scram,
we'll burn you all!


795
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:32.472
Pieces of shit! 
Get away from here!

796
01:18:36.305 --> 01:18:37.930
What happened?

797
01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:45.513
We're sorry,
but we can't keep them here.


798
01:18:45.847 --> 01:18:47.472
You know they're good people!

799
01:18:47.638 --> 01:18:51.305
Maybe, but my wife
has a heart condition.


800
01:18:51.555 --> 01:18:54.222
And you said two,
now there's three.


801
01:18:54.388 --> 01:18:56.597
- We'll pay extra.
- That's not it.


802
01:18:56.763 --> 01:18:59.055
Here's your advance,
take them away.


803
01:18:59.222 --> 01:19:00.680
Where, at this hour?

804
01:19:00.847 --> 01:19:03.763
We can't keep them,
please understand.


805
01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:06.430
Please, at least until tomorrow!

806
01:19:06.722 --> 01:19:09.888
I'm sorry,
but what if those goons come back?


807
01:19:10.138 --> 01:19:13.388
Can't have my wife having
a heart attack for 500 lei.


808
01:19:13.722 --> 01:19:16.638
You know it takes hours
for the ambulance to arrive.


809
01:19:16.805 --> 01:19:18.347
Are you feeling ill?

810
01:19:18.513 --> 01:19:19.513
Can I help?

811
01:19:25.513 --> 01:19:27.555
- Have you seen Rauff?
- No.


812
01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:31.055
Check inside again.

813
01:19:46.055 --> 01:19:47.722
He's not in the house.

814
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:51.805
OK, we're going.

815
01:19:56.638 --> 01:19:57.847
Thank you.

816
01:20:55.555 --> 01:20:57.180
What's with that?

817
01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.097
Someone's attacked the foreigners.
They're sleeping here.


818
01:21:01.347 --> 01:21:03.847
- Someone's attacked them?
- Yes.


819
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:05.430
Who?

820
01:21:05.597 --> 01:21:07.680
I don't know, they had masks on.

821
01:21:08.138 --> 01:21:10.847
- Must've been drunk.
- Yes, probably.


822
01:21:11.138 --> 01:21:13.597
- Any idea who they were?
- Not a clue.


823
01:21:14.055 --> 01:21:15.805
None of my business, either.

824
01:21:15.972 --> 01:21:18.763
Really?
After they almost set us on fire?


825
01:21:19.305 --> 01:21:21.347
What were you doing there?

826
01:21:21.513 --> 01:21:24.430
- Is that the problem?
- That too.


827
01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:27.555
So it'd be OK
if they had only set them on fire?


828
01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.138
Of course not, but...

829
01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:32.597
Can't you see they don't belong here?

830
01:21:32.763 --> 01:21:34.013
Why not?

831
01:21:34.763 --> 01:21:38.638
Sorry, I guess you need them,
but they don't belong here.


832
01:21:38.805 --> 01:21:40.555
You should just go home.

833
01:21:43.138 --> 01:21:45.888
- Where are you going to sleep?
- What do you mean?


834
01:21:46.388 --> 01:21:48.513
I mean where you're going to sleep.

835
01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.055
Here, where else?

836
01:21:50.597 --> 01:21:53.972
That's kind of not
right, if you ask me.

837
01:21:54.138 --> 01:21:55.597
Well, I'm not.

838
01:21:55.763 --> 01:21:58.638
We just fuck.
I'm not your wife.


839
01:21:58.805 --> 01:22:01.388
- We just fuck?
- You know what I mean.


840
01:22:01.555 --> 01:22:04.388
You won't say you love me,
but you issue opinions?


841
01:22:04.555 --> 01:22:06.055
I sure do.

842
01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:09.513
I don't want you
sleeping here with strangers.


843
01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.847
Why?
You think I'm fucking them or what?


844
01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.597
If they as much
as come close to you...

845
01:22:16.763 --> 01:22:18.847
What? Then what?

846
01:22:19.555 --> 01:22:21.180
I'm not your property, OK?

847
01:22:21.347 --> 01:22:22.555
Go back to your place.

848
01:22:22.722 --> 01:22:25.555
Set your own life straight
if you're so smart.


849
01:22:28.263 --> 01:22:29.472
Go on.

850
01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:56.597
Re-read and sign it.

851
01:22:56.763 --> 01:22:58.180
Already done.

852
01:23:01.347 --> 01:23:03.847
- Do you suspect anyone?
- No.


853
01:23:05.638 --> 01:23:09.055
- They spoke to you in Romanian?
- Yes, but with an accent.


854
01:23:09.305 --> 01:23:10.472
I see.

855
01:23:11.013 --> 01:23:12.805
You see what?

856
01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:16.013
That they spoke Romanian with an accent.

857
01:23:16.513 --> 01:23:18.972
Does it matter for the investigation?

858
01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:20.930
It's a fact.

859
01:23:21.263 --> 01:23:24.472
Everyone here knows Romanian,
Hungarians included.


860
01:23:24.638 --> 01:23:26.930
But they don't speak it.

861
01:23:27.347 --> 01:23:29.805
They do when they have to.

862
01:23:31.888 --> 01:23:35.472
Any progress on the online threats?

863
01:23:35.638 --> 01:23:40.222
We've sent it up to county office,
they have the technology.


864
01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:42.555
Is the mayor in?

865
01:23:43.138 --> 01:23:44.597
Not today.

866
01:23:45.013 --> 01:23:46.430
He's in town.

867
01:23:47.263 --> 01:23:50.388
Call me if you need me
or learn anything else.


868
01:23:50.555 --> 01:23:52.680
- Of course.
- Thank you.


869
01:23:53.263 --> 01:23:54.805
- Have a good day.
- You too.


870
01:23:56.263 --> 01:23:58.597
- Any news on the third one?
- No.


871
01:23:58.763 --> 01:24:01.055
- Did you tell the police?
- No.


872
01:24:01.222 --> 01:24:03.305
I spoke to the mayor.

873
01:24:04.013 --> 01:24:06.972
He'll call a community meeting
at the church.


874
01:24:07.138 --> 01:24:09.430
Shouldn't we call the press as well?

875
01:24:09.597 --> 01:24:12.930
He said to try and keep it local.
Internet's already aflame.


876
01:24:13.097 --> 01:24:15.180
What about the application?

877
01:24:15.388 --> 01:24:16.805
We push on.

878
01:24:16.972 --> 01:24:19.555
- So I greenlight the next two?
- Yes.


879
01:24:32.847 --> 01:24:35.597
In Ditrău,
they said we should stop delivering.


880
01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:39.388
- And Topliţa?
- Down to two crates.


881
01:24:39.555 --> 01:24:42.847
Here in the village,
they returned it all, dried.


882
01:24:44.722 --> 01:24:47.555
We'll make it into toast and crumbs.

883
01:24:47.847 --> 01:24:50.680
- We don't have the packaging.
- We'll order some.


884
01:24:50.847 --> 01:24:53.013
For now, bring them in.

885
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:17.388
- Hello, Madam.
- Hi.


886
01:25:17.555 --> 01:25:19.763
- Is the Reverend in?
- He's eating.


887
01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:22.555
Can you please tell him
to come out when he's done?


888
01:25:25.388 --> 01:25:26.638
Praised be!

889
01:25:27.597 --> 01:25:29.305
I told them you were busy.

890
01:25:29.472 --> 01:25:32.055
I hear the mayor's called
a meeting tomorrow?


891
01:25:32.222 --> 01:25:33.305
Yes.

892
01:25:33.638 --> 01:25:38.305
I wanted you to meet these people
before the meeting.


893
01:25:38.888 --> 01:25:41.013
I have no reason to meet them.

894
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:44.305
I don't have anything against anyone.

895
01:25:44.555 --> 01:25:48.722
I am only a messenger,
telling you what people want.


896
01:25:48.930 --> 01:25:53.013
But do you agree with them
being thrown out of church?


897
01:25:53.305 --> 01:25:56.763
Muslims aren't allowed in
and you know it.


898
01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:59.972
They're not Muslim. 
And he's Catholic.

899
01:26:02.347 --> 01:26:03.638
Madam.

900
01:26:03.805 --> 01:26:07.222
If people don't want them,
I have no say in it.


901
01:26:07.555 --> 01:26:10.555
Everyone has their own place
in the world,


902
01:26:11.013 --> 01:26:13.055
as God above has ordained.

903
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:17.013
This is unchristian, Reverend.

904
01:26:17.388 --> 01:26:21.013
Don't you tell me about
what is and isn't christian.


905
01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:23.222
You who never come to church.

906
01:26:23.388 --> 01:26:25.763
What's the use,
if churchgoers act like this?


907
01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:27.597
Please leave now.

908
01:26:28.388 --> 01:26:30.930
It is late and I need to prepare.

909
01:26:36.013 --> 01:26:37.472
Have a good day.

910
01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:41.347
Have a good day.

911
01:26:42.222 --> 01:26:43.305
Have a good day.

912
01:26:45.347 --> 01:26:47.347
You don't suspect anyone?

913
01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:48.888
As if.

914
01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:50.805
Well?

915
01:26:53.263 --> 01:26:55.222
Where were you last night?

916
01:26:55.930 --> 01:26:57.388
- At home.
- Alone?


917
01:26:57.805 --> 01:27:00.138
Say it, we know the truth already.

918
01:27:00.305 --> 01:27:02.513
Then what do you want from me?

919
01:27:03.472 --> 01:27:05.013
This here.

920
01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.638
Demeter Zsolt.

921
01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:11.680
He testified that he was with you
yesterday evening.


922
01:27:12.513 --> 01:27:13.972
True or false?

923
01:27:14.472 --> 01:27:16.388
Since he testified...

924
01:27:17.888 --> 01:27:20.847
You want us to bother Papa Otto
for questioning?


925
01:27:21.138 --> 01:27:22.680
I assume not.

926
01:27:24.513 --> 01:27:25.722
Matthias.

927
01:27:26.263 --> 01:27:28.180
Don't play with fire.

928
01:27:28.388 --> 01:27:32.347
I reported to the county office
and they asked if you were in the village.


929
01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:35.930
Your employer in Germany
asked them about you.


930
01:27:37.972 --> 01:27:40.513
Now what am I to tell them?

931
01:28:12.472 --> 01:28:13.722
Good evening.

932
01:28:15.013 --> 01:28:16.222
Good evening!

933
01:28:16.847 --> 01:28:18.305
Is Matthias home?

934
01:28:18.555 --> 01:28:19.722
No, he isn't.

935
01:28:23.555 --> 01:28:26.263
- I see, thank you.
- Should I tell him anything?


936
01:28:26.513 --> 01:28:28.638
No, it's fine. 
I'll call him.

937
01:28:30.513 --> 01:28:32.138
Are you doing well?

938
01:28:34.513 --> 01:28:35.680
Well enough.

939
01:28:37.847 --> 01:28:39.138
Goodnight.

940
01:28:51.638 --> 01:28:54.597
- Damn, you scared us!
- Why are you with him?


941
01:28:54.763 --> 01:28:56.597
- He's afraid!
- Let him go alone.


942
01:28:56.763 --> 01:28:59.222
I will when he stops being afraid.

943
01:28:59.513 --> 01:29:01.513
Stop it, are you insane?

944
01:29:03.722 --> 01:29:05.347
He saw a man!

945
01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:07.722
In the forest.

946
01:29:08.222 --> 01:29:10.180
Hanging from a tree.

947
01:29:10.888 --> 01:29:12.638
Why didn't you tell me?

948
01:29:13.472 --> 01:29:16.097
I found out yesterday.
He drew a picture.


949
01:29:18.347 --> 01:29:20.263
Come, Rudi, we'll be late.

950
01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.138
Show me where.

951
01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:38.388
Was it there, Rudi?

952
01:29:49.763 --> 01:29:50.972
Rudi?

953
01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:57.472
See? Nothing here.
Nothing to be scared of.


954
01:29:57.638 --> 01:29:59.263
Maybe he got the wrong place.

955
01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:02.763
No, there's nothing, tell him.
It's just fear.


956
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:05.055
- He saw it!
- Saw what?


957
01:30:05.347 --> 01:30:07.138
You think people just disappear?

958
01:30:07.305 --> 01:30:10.013
Maybe animals ate him.

959
01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.472
I'm sorry, Rudi.

960
01:30:14.013 --> 01:30:16.513
I didn't mean to scare you.
Forgive me.


961
01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:38.513
Before I give the word
to the mayor here,


962
01:30:38.722 --> 01:30:40.722
let us all say a prayer

963
01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:44.763
and may God enlighten us
as we seek the right way.


964
01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:46.472
In what language?

965
01:30:46.638 --> 01:30:49.138
Each in their own. 
The Lord's Prayer.

966
01:30:50.222 --> 01:30:53.347
Our Father who art in heaven,

967
01:30:53.513 --> 01:30:55.722
hallowed be thy name.

968
01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:57.763
Thy kingdom come...

969
01:30:58.013 --> 01:31:00.222
Steffi, I'm over here!

970
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:02.597
Can I?

971
01:31:03.930 --> 01:31:04.930
Excuse me.

972
01:31:05.097 --> 01:31:08.347
Father, there's more people outside.

973
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.305
I now give the word to the mayor.

974
01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:19.513
Dear fellow citizens, may I ask...

975
01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.680
Speak up, there's too many of us!

976
01:31:22.388 --> 01:31:23.847
Could you speak up?

977
01:31:24.013 --> 01:31:25.555
Do you have speakers?

978
01:31:25.763 --> 01:31:27.347
They're not wired.

979
01:31:27.513 --> 01:31:29.847
There are some
at the cultural center.


980
01:31:30.013 --> 01:31:32.680
- Is there anyone there now?
- No.


981
01:31:33.222 --> 01:31:35.305
- Should we move there?
- Yes.


982
01:31:35.472 --> 01:31:36.972
It's warmer, too.

983
01:31:37.138 --> 01:31:39.847
Alright, let's move
to the cultural center.


984
01:31:40.222 --> 01:31:41.763
Order, please!

985
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:43.472
Allow me!

986
01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.180
To the cultural center!

987
01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:09.763
Please, take your seats.

988
01:32:12.513 --> 01:32:14.763
Can I have this seat, please?

989
01:32:16.138 --> 01:32:18.472
- Can everyone hear?
- Yes.


990
01:32:18.638 --> 01:32:20.138
Speak Romanian!

991
01:32:20.305 --> 01:32:23.847
- All good?
- You're asking if I'm good?


992
01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:25.222
Yes.

993
01:32:25.597 --> 01:32:27.222
See for yourself.

994
01:32:27.722 --> 01:32:29.263
I wanted to say sorry.

995
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:30.638
For what?

996
01:32:31.305 --> 01:32:34.513
- That you got mad.
- Oh, that.


997
01:32:34.847 --> 01:32:37.347
And for what I said.

998
01:32:38.513 --> 01:32:39.555
Alright.

999
01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:42.972
- Give me your hand.
- Stop it, this is not the time.


1000
01:32:43.138 --> 01:32:44.305
What, I embarrass you?

1001
01:32:44.472 --> 01:32:45.972
Speak your own language.

1002
01:32:46.138 --> 01:32:49.472
- I'm asking for your hand.
- This is really not the time!


1003
01:32:50.472 --> 01:32:53.472
Just give me your hand
and I'll keep quiet.


1004
01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:57.430
... let's avoid the spreading
of embarrassing rumors.


1005
01:32:57.597 --> 01:32:59.680
- Do we all agree?
- Yes.


1006
01:33:00.972 --> 01:33:03.763
Do we have anyone
from the press here?


1007
01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:05.555
Alright, thank you.

1008
01:33:05.722 --> 01:33:07.180
I see more.

1009
01:33:07.347 --> 01:33:09.888
It's alright.
We have nothing to hide,


1010
01:33:10.055 --> 01:33:12.763
we've always been a peaceful community,

1011
01:33:12.930 --> 01:33:15.180
with no ethnic conflicts since the '90s.

1012
01:33:15.347 --> 01:33:19.513
- Minus that murder 8 years ago.
- Yes, a sad, shameful event.


1013
01:33:19.888 --> 01:33:23.388
Not caused by a member
of our historic communities.


1014
01:33:23.555 --> 01:33:27.347
And once the village
had no more citizens of that ethnicity,


1015
01:33:27.513 --> 01:33:30.430
we've lived in peace,
Hungarians and Romanians...


1016
01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:33.180
- Germans, too!
- Yes, few though they are.


1017
01:33:33.347 --> 01:33:37.430
We got rid of the Gypsies,
now we fight over foreigners?


1018
01:33:37.597 --> 01:33:40.138
Are Gypsies the issue here?

1019
01:33:40.638 --> 01:33:44.430
Let us mind our words,
the West is watching.


1020
01:33:44.597 --> 01:33:46.888
Spare us your West!

1021
01:33:47.055 --> 01:33:51.055
My son-in-law's bosses in Germany
called him nothing but a Gypsy!


1022
01:33:51.847 --> 01:33:57.555
And he's more German than migrants
who pick up trash for the dainty natives!


1023
01:33:57.763 --> 01:34:00.388
See what happens when you're tolerant?

1024
01:34:00.555 --> 01:34:04.638
Soon the West won't let us
use words like "mom" and "dad"!


1025
01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:07.638
Alright then,
let me put it another way.


1026
01:34:07.847 --> 01:34:11.222
Such affirmations hurt local tourism.

1027
01:34:12.638 --> 01:34:16.888
- EU membership entails obligations.
- Like being their retail market?


1028
01:34:17.055 --> 01:34:19.805
Please, let's just begin.
Here is how we'll do this.


1029
01:34:20.138 --> 01:34:23.305
After a brief introduction,
I'll pass the mic around.


1030
01:34:23.472 --> 01:34:24.763
Does anyone want to speak?

1031
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:25.930
- Yes!
- Yes!


1032
01:34:26.097 --> 01:34:29.638
Let's be civilized,
organized, no interrupting.


1033
01:34:29.888 --> 01:34:32.347
I give you my word, as elected mayor,

1034
01:34:32.513 --> 01:34:36.138
everyone who wants to speak
will get their chance.


1035
01:34:37.722 --> 01:34:40.347
Do we have a microphone for the room?

1036
01:34:40.513 --> 01:34:42.638
Then let us start.

1037
01:34:43.513 --> 01:34:48.347
We are here because you signed a...

1038
01:34:49.138 --> 01:34:52.972
Because the local bakery
hired some foreign citizens.


1039
01:34:53.138 --> 01:34:57.472
Legally employed, not migrants,
like the village rumor says.


1040
01:34:58.138 --> 01:35:03.222
And you, the citizens, made a petition
demanding that they leave.


1041
01:35:03.513 --> 01:35:05.638
Who signed it?
Read out the names!


1042
01:35:05.805 --> 01:35:07.888
- Do you have the list?
- Yes.


1043
01:35:08.055 --> 01:35:12.805
Németh Zsolt, Kelemen Tibor,
Cipariu Aurica, Auner Matthias,


1044
01:35:13.222 --> 01:35:15.222
Teodorescu Avram, 
Iancu Áron...

1045
01:35:15.388 --> 01:35:18.472
Listen, I didn't put my name
on any list.


1046
01:35:18.638 --> 01:35:21.430
- I don't even care.
- That's just it!


1047
01:35:21.597 --> 01:35:24.055
There are 395 signatures.

1048
01:35:24.555 --> 01:35:27.055
You really want to hear all the names?

1049
01:35:27.222 --> 01:35:28.722
It's 411.

1050
01:35:31.013 --> 01:35:34.347
Please make a copy
and post it for all to see!


1051
01:35:34.513 --> 01:35:36.888
We'll pin it to the notice board.

1052
01:35:37.055 --> 01:35:42.263
There is also a list of names of those
who want these people to stay.


1053
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:43.597
Who are they?

1054
01:35:43.763 --> 01:35:45.930
Me, Szabó Csilla,

1055
01:35:46.097 --> 01:35:49.388
Dénes Viktória, Amzulescu Traian,
Steffi Auner, Nagy Réka,


1056
01:35:49.555 --> 01:35:50.805
Németh Kinga,
your sister...


1057
01:35:50.972 --> 01:35:53.888
They're bakery employees!

1058
01:35:54.138 --> 01:35:56.513
- What?
- You made them sign!


1059
01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.930
No one made them.

1060
01:35:58.097 --> 01:36:01.138
Knowing the foreign workers personally,

1061
01:36:01.305 --> 01:36:03.138
they took the initiative.

1062
01:36:03.305 --> 01:36:05.930
Some even commute from Bradu.

1063
01:36:06.097 --> 01:36:08.597
I work here,
I'm entitled to an opinion!


1064
01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:11.138
How many names on the list?

1065
01:36:11.347 --> 01:36:14.513
28, but we only started it this morning.

1066
01:36:14.805 --> 01:36:16.097
Forget it!

1067
01:36:16.263 --> 01:36:17.555
Please, people!

1068
01:36:17.722 --> 01:36:20.805
When we don't like the outcome,
suddenly we don't want democracy!


1069
01:36:20.972 --> 01:36:25.513
395 for, 28 against.
Why are we still here?


1070
01:36:26.222 --> 01:36:27.930
411.

1071
01:36:28.097 --> 01:36:29.638
Please, let's start.

1072
01:36:29.805 --> 01:36:31.888
- Mrs. Miklós.
- May I?


1073
01:36:32.513 --> 01:36:34.263
Closer to the mic!

1074
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:39.513
We have nothing against these people,
as long as they stay in their country,


1075
01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:44.138
not in our bakery
sticking their hands in bread we eat.


1076
01:36:44.305 --> 01:36:47.805
Call me old fashioned,
but it makes me sick.


1077
01:36:47.972 --> 01:36:48.888
Me too!

1078
01:36:49.055 --> 01:36:52.888
Let's stop buying from them
until they throw them out!


1079
01:36:53.805 --> 01:36:55.972
Seriously now, Mayor!

1080
01:36:56.138 --> 01:37:00.513
Why not?
Maybe an outside standpoint could help.


1081
01:37:01.638 --> 01:37:04.263
First of all, who is he?

1082
01:37:05.222 --> 01:37:08.680
He's from a French NGO
for conservation...


1083
01:37:16.013 --> 01:37:19.263
He's here to help
count the bear population.


1084
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:21.180
Does anyone need a translation?

1085
01:37:21.347 --> 01:37:24.597
- Does he get paid for it?
- I don't know.


1086
01:37:26.055 --> 01:37:28.722
How much is he
paid to count our bears?

1087
01:37:28.888 --> 01:37:31.013
No idea, he's not on our payroll.

1088
01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:32.888
It's a matter of principle!

1089
01:37:33.055 --> 01:37:35.930
We're jobless,
the mine got shut down...


1090
01:37:36.097 --> 01:37:37.222
By ecologists!

1091
01:37:37.388 --> 01:37:41.638
Animals attack our livestock,
and he gets paid to count our bears?


1092
01:37:41.805 --> 01:37:44.222
He can count them in his own country!

1093
01:37:46.222 --> 01:37:48.180
They don't have any more bears,

1094
01:37:48.347 --> 01:37:51.097
they killed them all to build freeways!

1095
01:37:51.263 --> 01:37:52.430
Same with the wolves!

1096
01:37:52.597 --> 01:37:55.597
So they got all developed

1097
01:37:55.763 --> 01:37:58.930
and now they tell us
to be Europe's zoo?


1098
01:38:00.138 --> 01:38:02.263
Like they did in Africa!

1099
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:03.930
Only we're not savages!

1100
01:38:04.097 --> 01:38:07.805
Please!
Will you let the man speak?


1101
01:38:08.472 --> 01:38:09.680
Order!

1102
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:11.305
Merci.

1103
01:38:16.222 --> 01:38:20.097
We noticed. In Paris there are
more Blacks and Arabs than French!


1104
01:38:20.263 --> 01:38:22.597
It makes you afraid to use the metro!

1105
01:38:25.138 --> 01:38:28.847
You wanted colonies, now handle them!

1106
01:38:29.013 --> 01:38:31.430
But why do we
have to pay for it?

1107
01:38:39.388 --> 01:38:44.430
I don't believe
you've seen any Hungarians begging!


1108
01:38:44.763 --> 01:38:47.680
Nor Romanians!
Those are Gypsies!


1109
01:38:47.847 --> 01:38:50.180
Let's make this distinction, please!

1110
01:38:50.513 --> 01:38:52.638
The Roma are citizens too.

1111
01:38:52.805 --> 01:38:55.430
So listen, Mr. Fraternité
-Egalité...

1112
01:38:55.597 --> 01:38:59.555
If you love them so much,
why do you keep sending them back?


1113
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:08.763
There's no integrating Gypsies,
why beat around the bush?


1114
01:39:09.138 --> 01:39:10.930
Order, please!

1115
01:39:11.513 --> 01:39:16.013
So integrate your Blacks and Arabs
if you're so good at it!


1116
01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:22.597
- They'll soon slit your throats!
- Serves you right!


1117
01:39:22.763 --> 01:39:26.888
You didn't learn from Charlie Hebdo!
You have nothing sacred!


1118
01:39:27.055 --> 01:39:32.180
Please, let's put this aside
and return to our business.


1119
01:39:32.472 --> 01:39:35.805
- Civilly, without offending.
- Who's offending anyone?


1120
01:39:35.972 --> 01:39:39.638
- Now we can't tell the truth?
- Communism all over again!


1121
01:39:39.805 --> 01:39:42.430
You get punished
for speaking your mind.


1122
01:39:42.597 --> 01:39:46.222
Please, let's get back to the subject!

1123
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:48.597
We are on the subject!

1124
01:39:48.763 --> 01:39:51.013
We've seen it in other countries.

1125
01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:52.888
First there's one or two,

1126
01:39:53.055 --> 01:39:55.472
then they bring the whole family!

1127
01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:57.930
It's their custom!

1128
01:39:58.097 --> 01:39:59.805
Then they want mosques!

1129
01:39:59.972 --> 01:40:03.180
In Germany you can't even enter
their neighborhoods!


1130
01:40:03.347 --> 01:40:06.597
They attack women in the street
for not wearing a veil!


1131
01:40:06.763 --> 01:40:10.555
I hardly think we need to fear that
in our village.


1132
01:40:10.722 --> 01:40:15.055
Not yet, but if they keep coming,
won't they end up asking for rights?


1133
01:40:15.222 --> 01:40:16.763
With bombings and whatnot?

1134
01:40:16.930 --> 01:40:19.263
Out with them! 
Kick them out!

1135
01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:22.888
Rest assured, in our neck of the woods,

1136
01:40:23.055 --> 01:40:27.847
we wouldn't make the news
even if they blew us all up!


1137
01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:29.430
Talk about what?

1138
01:40:29.972 --> 01:40:33.055
Please, Doctor,
just stick to the subject.


1139
01:40:33.972 --> 01:40:36.888
I only have one observation to make.

1140
01:40:37.305 --> 01:40:39.847
I don't know
the gentlemen from Bangladesh...


1141
01:40:40.013 --> 01:40:41.263
Sri Lanka!

1142
01:40:41.472 --> 01:40:44.513
Sri Lanka.
They may be very clean.


1143
01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.680
I'll say this in Romanian
for all to understand.


1144
01:40:48.138 --> 01:40:49.763
Asian pathology is different...

1145
01:40:49.930 --> 01:40:51.888
At least give me your hand.

1146
01:40:52.055 --> 01:40:56.972
Same as their diseases,
their viruses, their immune reactions.


1147
01:40:57.138 --> 01:41:00.847
That's how this planet
got AIDS, bird flu,


1148
01:41:01.013 --> 01:41:03.388
and who knows what else next!

1149
01:41:03.555 --> 01:41:06.763
From communities
who come into direct contact


1150
01:41:06.930 --> 01:41:09.930
with animals: monkeys, bears, bats...

1151
01:41:10.097 --> 01:41:14.180
Then they spread it,
because they're free to circulate!


1152
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:15.430
Doctor,

1153
01:41:15.597 --> 01:41:19.305
they had a full set of tests
before employment.


1154
01:41:22.305 --> 01:41:24.180
If I may!

1155
01:41:24.847 --> 01:41:27.138
This is about hygiene.

1156
01:41:27.305 --> 01:41:31.222
Pardon me, but Muslims don't
wipe their butts like the rest of us.


1157
01:41:32.263 --> 01:41:34.305
And in a bakery...

1158
01:41:34.472 --> 01:41:36.805
- They're not Muslim!
- Even so!


1159
01:41:36.972 --> 01:41:39.388
Please!
Mr. Baciu.


1160
01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.888
I have one last thing to say.

1161
01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:44.638
Our end won't come from the atomic bomb.

1162
01:41:44.805 --> 01:41:49.097
It will come from
all these wretches swarming us,


1163
01:41:49.388 --> 01:41:54.347
as we build parks in villages on EU funds
and measure cucumbers with calipers!


1164
01:41:54.513 --> 01:41:56.638
Your cucumber
is easy enough to measure!


1165
01:41:56.805 --> 01:42:00.305
Truth be told,
why did we need a park in the village?


1166
01:42:00.472 --> 01:42:02.472
I can answer that.

1167
01:42:02.638 --> 01:42:06.222
We access the available EU funds.

1168
01:42:06.388 --> 01:42:08.680
And the ones for village parks
were available.


1169
01:42:08.847 --> 01:42:12.888
Why not sewage first?
And paved streets?


1170
01:42:13.055 --> 01:42:16.597
Because there were no funds for that!

1171
01:42:16.763 --> 01:42:21.597
Besides, with the funding for parks
we installed street lighting.


1172
01:42:21.763 --> 01:42:24.388
I've had my hand up
since the start!


1173
01:42:24.555 --> 01:42:27.763
- But to the subject.
- Sure, Mayor.


1174
01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:29.847
My name is Brebu Vasile.

1175
01:42:30.013 --> 01:42:33.930
For those who don't know me,
I used to work at the bakery.


1176
01:42:34.222 --> 01:42:35.722
I think the problem is:

1177
01:42:35.888 --> 01:42:39.472
Why hire foreigners for our jobs?

1178
01:42:39.847 --> 01:42:41.888
Because our folks don't want to work!

1179
01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:44.347
And why don't they?

1180
01:42:44.513 --> 01:42:46.513
They'd rather live on social aid!

1181
01:42:49.013 --> 01:42:51.263
Not true. Allow me to differ.

1182
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:54.097
Sure, there's a bad apple
in every crate.


1183
01:42:54.263 --> 01:42:58.263
But most of us work hard
in any country they go to.


1184
01:42:58.972 --> 01:43:03.305
You all know it,
work abroad is tough work.


1185
01:43:03.555 --> 01:43:06.597
A foreigner who hires you
does it to exploit you!


1186
01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:10.388
They pay, though!

1187
01:43:10.555 --> 01:43:13.388
Exactly, dear sir, thank you!

1188
01:43:13.555 --> 01:43:18.680
The question is:
Why does this company pay so little?


1189
01:43:19.097 --> 01:43:22.597
Why doesn't it pay overtime?

1190
01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:24.847
Of course we pay it!

1191
01:43:25.013 --> 01:43:30.888
Not true! I have 43 hours
of unpaid overtime I sued you for.


1192
01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:35.680
This is verifiable, we've been paying
all overtime since 2018.


1193
01:43:35.847 --> 01:43:38.430
Don't you tell me that,

1194
01:43:38.597 --> 01:43:40.513
I'm an old employee.

1195
01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:43.013
I know the overtime and the holidays

1196
01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:46.263
that I worked with no pay!

1197
01:43:46.972 --> 01:43:49.847
- Mr. Brebu...
- Wait!


1198
01:43:50.055 --> 01:43:52.597
I know all the other workers
feel the same


1199
01:43:52.763 --> 01:43:55.722
but don't dare to say it.

1200
01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:58.347
For fear they'll be fired!

1201
01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:03.472
The job ads were around for weeks!

1202
01:44:03.638 --> 01:44:06.555
- We're desperate to hire...
- On minimum wage!


1203
01:44:06.722 --> 01:44:09.347
You'd rather a loaf cost 5 lei?

1204
01:44:09.513 --> 01:44:11.055
Why not 10?

1205
01:44:11.222 --> 01:44:15.055
A bakery is hard work for little pay,

1206
01:44:15.222 --> 01:44:17.888
including holidays,
because people want fresh bread.


1207
01:44:18.055 --> 01:44:18.972
True.

1208
01:44:19.138 --> 01:44:20.972
- So that's how it is?
- Yes.


1209
01:44:21.138 --> 01:44:24.513
How come it's not the same for you?

1210
01:44:24.888 --> 01:44:27.888
How much was your fancy Mercedes?

1211
01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:32.347
While you pay workers the minimum wage!

1212
01:44:32.513 --> 01:44:34.305
The car is on lease.

1213
01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:37.722
On the backs of your workers, Madam!

1214
01:44:37.888 --> 01:44:40.430
The Reverend has a Mercedes too!

1215
01:44:42.138 --> 01:44:44.430
It belongs to my mom.

1216
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:47.347
And it was second-hand.

1217
01:44:47.513 --> 01:44:50.055
Please, we're drifting off the subject.

1218
01:44:50.222 --> 01:44:55.180
Thank you, Mr. Brebu,
we were not aware of these complaints.


1219
01:44:55.388 --> 01:44:58.972
Allow me, accusations have been made...

1220
01:44:59.138 --> 01:45:01.222
In Romanian, please!

1221
01:45:03.013 --> 01:45:04.430
Look.

1222
01:45:04.972 --> 01:45:10.180
In the last four years,
we've created most local jobs.


1223
01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:14.305
We also support the local music club

1224
01:45:14.472 --> 01:45:17.347
and want to keep supporting the region.

1225
01:45:17.513 --> 01:45:20.222
As such, we applied for EU funds.

1226
01:45:20.388 --> 01:45:24.513
- Not like you did it for us!
- The money will be spent here.


1227
01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.722
The money you don't pocket!

1228
01:45:26.888 --> 01:45:29.472
Please, we're off the subject again!

1229
01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.055
Let's put it to the vote.

1230
01:45:32.513 --> 01:45:37.055
Those in favor of our jobs being
available to foreigners brought here?


1231
01:45:37.888 --> 01:45:39.597
That's clear enough.

1232
01:45:39.763 --> 01:45:41.305
Matthias, please.

1233
01:45:45.222 --> 01:45:47.347
I didn't quite understand that.

1234
01:45:47.513 --> 01:45:50.638
He asked who's in favor
of the foreigners staying.


1235
01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:54.388
The question wasn't very well-phrased.

1236
01:45:54.555 --> 01:45:56.347
It was plenty well-phrased!

1237
01:45:56.513 --> 01:46:01.472
We're afraid of public opinion,
but most of us don't want them here!


1238
01:46:03.305 --> 01:46:06.847
Here's my proposal
to defuse the situation.


1239
01:46:07.013 --> 01:46:10.305
We give the foreign workers gloves...

1240
01:46:13.555 --> 01:46:18.388
Or we move them to other positions,
where they don't touch the dough.


1241
01:46:18.555 --> 01:46:21.472
We don't want them,
what the hell isn't clear?


1242
01:46:21.638 --> 01:46:24.597
Then we'll lodge them
in another village.


1243
01:46:24.763 --> 01:46:27.347
No, they should just leave!

1244
01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:33.055
Who wants to stop buying their bread
until they throw them out?


1245
01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.472
This country still has laws, you know!

1246
01:46:37.638 --> 01:46:41.347
That's why we want autonomy,
so we don't get told what to do.


1247
01:46:41.513 --> 01:46:45.180
I wonder how you Hungarians,
a minority in our country,


1248
01:46:45.347 --> 01:46:47.263
discriminate against other foreigners!

1249
01:46:49.638 --> 01:46:51.430
Auner Matthias!

1250
01:46:53.305 --> 01:46:55.055
Matthias, where are you?

1251
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:58.513
Matthias. Go home.

1252
01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:02.055
- What happened?
- Papa Otto hanged himself!


1253
01:48:22.930 --> 01:48:24.597
May God rest him in peace.

1254
01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:32.388
Help me.

1255
01:48:46.555 --> 01:48:48.472
I love you, Dad.

1256
01:48:48.638 --> 01:48:49.972
I love you.

1257
01:49:54.347 --> 01:49:57.805
We have to reapply to
the "under 30 employees" category.


1258
01:49:57.972 --> 01:49:59.013
There's no time.

1259
01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:02.555
Stop the production.
We'll do it all together tonight.


1260
01:50:02.722 --> 01:50:05.513
Two more workers
are due to arrive tonight.


1261
01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:08.347
- We'll have to cancel.
- We can't just...


1262
01:50:08.513 --> 01:50:11.763
What else can we do in this situation?

1263
01:50:13.263 --> 01:50:17.013
- These are humans we're talking about.
- I'm perfectly aware.


1264
01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.722
But we're humans too.

1265
01:50:19.888 --> 01:50:23.805
With no more clients,
all we've built these 10 years will fall.


1266
01:50:23.972 --> 01:50:25.763
And they'll be jobless.

1267
01:50:25.930 --> 01:50:28.180
No one will be left jobless.

1268
01:50:29.513 --> 01:50:33.930
Sure, you'll find new jobs
and I'll be left with all the debt.


1269
01:50:35.638 --> 01:50:38.388
So please get to work
on the application.


1270
01:50:42.013 --> 01:50:43.763
I'm not redoing it.

1271
01:50:45.013 --> 01:50:48.638
They have families, contracts,
we can't trample it all.


1272
01:50:48.805 --> 01:50:50.763
No one's trampling anything.

1273
01:50:51.138 --> 01:50:54.930
I spoke with the mayor, they'll sleep
at the police station tonight.


1274
01:50:55.138 --> 01:50:58.722
Tomorrow we move them to Bradu.
Let them know.


1275
01:51:05.513 --> 01:51:08.055
I got a job offer in Germany.

1276
01:51:09.638 --> 01:51:13.763
I wasn't going to take it,
but as things are, I quit right now.


1277
01:51:18.222 --> 01:51:22.097
You were the last one
who hadn't stabbed me in the back.


1278
01:51:28.013 --> 01:51:30.638
Please redo the application by tomorrow.

1279
01:51:32.972 --> 01:51:35.513
And tell the workers what we've decided.

1280
01:51:39.597 --> 01:51:41.597
You can take my car.

1281
01:52:03.388 --> 01:52:05.263
- The car is open.
- OK.


1282
01:52:12.930 --> 01:52:14.430
- Ready?
- Yes.


1283
01:54:30.097 --> 01:54:31.305
"Condoleanţe".

1284
01:54:31.472 --> 01:54:32.638
Condoleanţe.

1285
01:54:36.055 --> 01:54:37.305
The flowers.

1286
01:54:39.847 --> 01:54:41.305
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


1287
01:54:54.597 --> 01:54:55.555
Good evening.

1288
01:55:00.097 --> 01:55:01.847
- Condoleanţe.
- Thank you.


1289
01:55:19.263 --> 01:55:20.722
Sorry, Matthieu.

1290
01:56:06.263 --> 01:56:07.555
Who's there?

1291
01:57:25.638 --> 01:57:26.680
Rudi.

1292
01:57:50.638 --> 01:57:52.305
Let me in!

1293
01:57:54.597 --> 01:57:55.763
Ana!

1294
01:57:56.972 --> 01:57:58.305
Let me in!

1295
01:58:00.263 --> 01:58:02.305
- Where's Ana?
- Sleeping, what is it?


1296
01:58:02.472 --> 01:58:04.763
- Call off the dogs.
- What for?


1297
01:58:04.930 --> 01:58:07.597
- I want to talk to her.
- You can talk tomorrow.


1298
01:58:07.763 --> 01:58:09.013
Rudi!

1299
01:58:10.097 --> 01:58:12.638
- Come to Daddy.
- You're scaring him!


1300
01:58:12.805 --> 01:58:14.347
Daddy loves you!

1301
01:58:14.513 --> 01:58:16.555
You can talk
at a more normal hour!


1302
01:58:16.722 --> 01:58:18.180
Go inside, boy.

1303
01:58:18.347 --> 01:58:22.013
- Go rest, we'll talk tomorrow.
- Let me in!


1304
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:24.222
I said go home!

1305
01:58:25.097 --> 01:58:27.972
- Let me in!
- I'm calling the police!


1306
01:58:30.888 --> 01:58:32.430
Let me in!

1307
01:58:36.722 --> 01:58:37.930
Rauff?

1308
01:58:39.222 --> 01:58:40.722
Rauff, wait!

1309
02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:53.097
I'm sorry.

1310
02:01:55.347 --> 02:01:56.972
I really am.

1311
02:02:25.805 --> 02:02:27.097
Forgive me.

1312
02:02:27.847 --> 02:02:29.722
Please, forgive me!
