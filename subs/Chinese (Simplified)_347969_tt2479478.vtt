瞧谁来了

2
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.020
我今天太幸运了
My day is made. [Laughs]


3
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.150
我连早饭都还来不及吃 就要杀死我今天的第一个印第安人
I didn't even finish breakfast and I get to kill me a stinkin' Injun.


4
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.480
印第安人？
Injun?


5
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.950
你丫放屁 我才不是
Nah


6
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.680
我穿成这样是为了不会在大草原上被割掉头皮
I just dress like this so's I don't get scalped out on the prairie.


7
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.000
恩 衣服看起来是让人很信服
Oh, well, that's a convincing outfit.


8
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.480
也是 在外面那么多野蛮的人 很危险的
yeah u can't be too safe out there with savages running around


9
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.880
那么 你需要买什么
So, what can I do you for?


10
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.550
我要买5包面粉 一根上面加有花生酱的胡萝卜
Need some flour. Five sacks.And a carrot with peanut butter on it.


11
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.280
一共多少钱
 what's that gonna run me?


12
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.080
一袋面粉45美分 那么5袋面粉就是...
Well, sack of flour's 45 cents. So, five sacks...


13
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.150
就是40...

14
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.680
需要我重复一遍吗
Wanna get back to me on that?


15
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.620
恩 对了面粉在地下室 你可以自己去拿
Yeah, look... the flour's in the basement.You can fetch it yourself.


16
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.220
非常感谢
Much obliged.


17
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.680
哟 瞧瞧站着的这位美女
Well, lookie what we got here.


18
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.080
在红色大草原上独自站立的一朵金花
Sweet piece of red prairie meat out all by her lonesome.


19
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.220
-Nelly 你觉得如何 -我觉得这位美人在等你
- What do you make of that, Nelly?-Oh, I think she's waiting on you, Will.


20
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.950
我们来鸟
Here we go.


21
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.620
你肯定在想 像我们5个风流倜傥 有着完美下颚弧度的男淫
Now, you must be wondering why five badass hombres with perfect jawlines...


22
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.480
都喜欢像你一样的印第安妞
all spot the same stylish Apatch.


23
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.220
关我毛线事
Not my business.


24
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.350
我们几个都把眼睛挖出来了 这是我们帮派的象征
We all carved our eyeballs out our skull to show how devoted we are to this gang.


25
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.220
我们是左眼帮派
We the Left-Eye Boys!


26
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.350
美女 你的眼睛太漂亮了 你觉得我们可不可以...借一只？
You got real pretty eyes, miss.You reckon we can, I don't know, borrow one?


27
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.950
你们觉得问女士这种问题合适吗
Now, is that a proper question to ask a lady?


28
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.220
小子 你特么谁啊? 男盆友?
Who are you, slick? The boyfriend?


29
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.550
马上就是丈夫了
Soon to be the husband.


30
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.750
等一下 我看出来了 他是个白人!
Oh, wait a minute! That's a white boy under that getup.


31
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.680
操 是个白人！
That's a white boy? Oh, shit.


32
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.150
你这个黄脸白种人是不是电影《风中奇缘》看多了 喜欢印第安人装扮？
You partial to pale faces, Poca-hot-tits?


33
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.020
我让你见识一下真正的白人什么样
'Cause I can show you what a real white man's like.


34
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.350
对 Will 让他见识一下 跳起来 赶紧儿得 真有白人范儿
 Yeah, show her, Will. Yeah, go on. Yeah, shuffle up, Will.


35
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.220
现在我倒真想把眼睛挖出来了
Now, I do want to carve my eyes out.


36
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.950
你特么说什么？ -同志们 注意了
- What'd you say? - Hey, fellers


37
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.750
在我还没有正式开始之前 我就会打到你们
I'd hit the trail before you get hurt.


38
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.750
你有没有搞错？ 你会打到我们？
 Before we get hurt?


39
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.480
我觉得你是不是抽印第安人的烟斗抽多了 假印第安人
I think you've been smokin' too much of that peace pipe, kemo-slobby.


40
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:21.480
你不要忘了 我们有5个人 而你只有1个人
Now, from what I see, there's one of you,


41
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.550
现在只剩4个人了你们
 Four of you


42
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.150
刚才发生了什么事情？ 
 What just happened?


43
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.150
傻逼们 还想看一次吗？
You wanna see it again?


44
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.420
呃...宝宝想看
Uh... yes.


45
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.880
-宝宝觉得不好玩了- 别吭气 傻逼
 I don't like this shit.- Shut up.


46
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.880
恩...你的佛山无影脚练的不错嘛
Well, that's some, uh...real fancy footwork.


47
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.820
但是觉得这场胡闹该用武器来结束了
But I think this hullabaloo has escalated to the firearms stage.


48
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.750
伙伴们 把枪上膛
Boys, let's ventilate this.


49
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.950
谁能告诉宝宝刚才发生什么事情了？|
What the shit that just happened?


50
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.280
动手之前 撂倒你们 就这么简单
"Hit the trail." It was so simple.


51
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.150
小白飞刀 你不能再这样做了 以后万一人多起来怎么办？
You must stop doing this, White Knife. One day, there will be too many.


52
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.750
今天肯定不会了 小狐狸
But not today, Smoking Fox.


53
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.080
拜托亲爱的 我们应该出发了
Please, my love... we must go.


54
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.880
外面都发生了什么事情！
What the hell happened out here?


55
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.020
来了一群印第安人 他们朝那个方向走了
Injuns. They went that way.


56
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:14.500
你他妈才不是白人 你是那个孤儿 小白飞刀 像个野兽一样的被印第安人带大 
You ain't no white man. You're that orphan, White Knife. Raised like an animal with those Apaches.


57
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.380
你以为你骗得了那群人吗？
You think you can fool of them?


58
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.280
对不起了 我的小马孩子~
 Aorry Ringo


59
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.280
现在我要开枪把你和你的印第安小婊砸打死
Well, now I'm gonna shoot you and your Injun whore.


60
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.620
借用一下你的早餐
Gotta cut breakfast short.


61
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.820
你这个贱人！
You suck, mister!


62
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:39.350
电影名-《傻逼6人帮》

63
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.350
小狐狸 你真幸运 小白飞刀是一个非常勇敢的男人
You lucky, Smoking Fox. White Knife all man. Bravest of all braves.


64
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.950
才不勇敢 傻乎乎的
Not brave. Foolish.


65
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.880
我才不想这么早当寡妇
I want to be wife, not widow


66
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.480
女士们 下午好啊
Afternoon, ladies.


67
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.480
这是我们印第安人的地盘
This is Apache land.


68
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.220
酋长 我不是来这里掠夺你们的土地的 我只是来找一个男人
I'm not here to take your land, Chief. I'm just looking for a particular boy.


69
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.150
我叫Frank Stockburn
I'm Frank Stockburn.


70
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.220
这个男人的母亲是我妻子
This boy's mother was my wife.


71
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.020
这个男人叫Tommy 他是我的儿子
And the boy, Tommy...he's my son.


72
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.680
有时候相信未必不是一件好事 小白飞刀 万事开端是需要你简单地向前跨出第一步
It is wise to be slow to trust, White Knife. But every new journey begins with a single step.


73
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.020
主动和你父亲谈谈吧
Speak with your father.


74
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:24.680
苍鹰 你才是我的父亲 在我母亲...之后 你找到并且抚养我成人
But you are my father, Screaming Eagle.Ever since my mother...Ever since you found me...


75
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:32.420
你教我如何打猎 如何斗争 何时该说话 何时保持沉默 如何做人
you taught me to hunt, to fight...when to speak and when to be silent.To be a man.


76
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:32.950
做一个好人
A good man.


77
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.280
这个自称我父亲的人 满嘴谎言  和其他白人没什么区别
And this Frank Stockburn,he is filled with lies, just like every other white man.


78
00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:46.020
有时白人也说实话 但是只有千分之一的概率
Sometimes, the whiteman speaks the truth.Like, one in 20, 25 times.


79
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.750
我觉得这次就是那千分之一的概率
I believe this is one of those times.


80
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:56.550
他毕竟认识你的母亲 跟他谈谈吧 说不定能带给你内心的平静
He knew your mother, White Knife. Maybe he can give you some peace. Talk to him.


81
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.950
让我好好睡一觉再说吧
Maybe after I close my eyes to dream.


82
00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:02.680
你都知道我做了很多坏事吧？
One look at me, and you knew your old man had done a lot of bad things, didn't ya?


83
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.150
我偷拐抢骗 杀人放火
I cheated men, I killed men...


84
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.550
所以我活该现在这样
So I deserve whatever's comin' to me.


85
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:17.620
曾经只有你母亲看到了我善良的一面
The only one that ever saw any good in me was your mother.


86
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.420
你到底来这做什么?
Why have you come here?


87
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:29.880
肯定不是过来给你闲聊的
Not a man for chitchat, huh? Well, me neither.


88
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.820
孩子 我快活不久了
Kid, I'm dying...of consumption.


89
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.950
不用担心 我不是过来和你叙旧的
Don't worry...I'm not looking for no big father-son hoo-ah.


90
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.680
"我爱你 儿子" "我也爱你 爸爸"
"I love you, son.""I love you too, Daddy."


91
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:03.080
肯定不可能像这样 我来这里是为了你
No I've come for a more tangible reason


92
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:17.620
Tommy 我从9岁就开始偷东西 到现在我已经积累了一笔不小的财富
Tommy, I've been stealing from folks since I was nine years old...and that's the way I've amassed a good little fortune.


93
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:27.750
我想在我死前做点正派的事情 我想把这笔钱留给你
I wanna do something decent with it.I want to give it to you, son.


94
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.310
我是不会要你的一分钱的
I don't want your money.


95
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:40.950
但是你可以把这笔...5万美元给抚养过你的善良的印第安人呀
But maybe you could give...$50,000 to these nice Injuns who raised you.


96
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.150
我们收下啦！
We'll take it.


97
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.820
快回你的帐篷里去
Go back to bed.


98
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.370
不好意思 但是我真的觉得我们应该收下
Sorry. Seriously, though, we'll take it.


99
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:56.420
听着 钱埋在 铁路旁边的草地上 一颗松树下 我们明早就去挖 怎样？
Look, it's buried in the meadow just up the trail,next to a big ol' pine tree.What do you say we go dig it up in the morning


100
00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.820
顺便过下圣诞节？
and start playing Santa Claus?


101
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:06.550
虽然关于我母亲的事情我已经记不太清楚了...但是我很清楚记得她告诉过我...
I don't remember much about my mother...but I do remember her telling me...


102
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.560
你早就已经死了
you were dead.


103
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:20.150
可能是因为...她不想你来找我
Maybe it was because...she didn't want you to come looking for me.


104
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.550
她是一位聪明的女士 唯一做的蠢事就是爱上我
She was a smart lady.Only stupid thing she ever did was fall for me.


105
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:35.220
遇到你母亲 是我这辈子最幸运的事
Meeting Betty Dunson...was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me.


106
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:48.280
当时在银色峡谷 我第一眼看倒你母亲 她正在向一个喝醉酒的大块头铁匠大吼大叫
From the first day I laid eyes on her...she was bawlin' out this...half-drunk, big ol' burly blacksmith... down at Silver Canyon.


107
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.480
她是我今生的唯一
She's been the only one, Tommy.


108
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.280
我母亲原来脾气这么暴躁？
Mom had a temper?


109
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.880
糟糕？ 你妈发起火来 谁都要遭殃
Temper? When she got her dander up, look out.


110
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:20.150
有次我们在一个酒吧里 你妈旁边坐了个人 他开始说如何做一个完美的樱桃派...
We was in a saloon once.This fellow sitting next to her starts talking about the perfect way to make a cherry pie...


111
00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:27.880
然后你妈跟我说 你到底从哪里找来的花送给他们的？
So your mom says to me, Frank, come here a minute.Tell me again, just where did you get them flowers?"


112
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:33.750
我回答说 我知道你认为我是从墓地里面偷来的 哈哈
I said, "I know that you think I stole them from the graveyard."


113
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:36.150
帅哥们 早上好
Good morning, boys.


114
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.150
早上好 从来不穿咪咪罩的美女
Morning, Never Wears Bra.


115
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.480
小白飞刀 昨天晚上我梦到你了
I had dream about you last night, White Knife.


116
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.080
恩 很好啊
Oh, that's nice.


117
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:50.150
可不怎么好哦 在梦里你很淘气 灰常灰常淘气哦
Not nice dream.In dream, you naughty. You naughty, white knife.


118
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.550
看起来 我儿子很受欢迎嘛
Mmm, somebody's got an admirer.


119
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:58.420
话虽如此 但是和你一样 我这一辈子只有一个女人
Yes, yes.But like you, there's only one woman for me.


120
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.680
我们一家人都是...
I guess we Stockburns are...


121
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.820
用情都很专一
partial to the sweet ones.


122
00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.020
的确如此
Yes, sir.


123
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.620
就像我对你母亲一样
Like your mother.


124
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.880
她怎么死的?
How did she die, Tommy?


125
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.220
能告诉我吗
You tell me?


126
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:25.080
有一天 学校里的一群大孩子决定要揍我
Well, there were these big kids at school fixin' to beat me up.


127
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:30.550
我自己不敢面对 于是我让我她一起陪我过去
Instead of facing them myself,I had her walk me there.


128
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:36.950
突然冒出一个人 掏出手枪击中了我母亲
This feller comes out of nowhere...walks right up to her and shoots her dead.


129
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:46.150
她当场就死掉了 要不是保护我这个没用的儿子 她本应该在家里 毫发无损的
So that's how she died,protecting her gutless son instead of being home,safe where she belonged.


130
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.220
谁过来了？Bony Express？
Who's that? Is that Bony Express?


131
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.620
Bony Express怎么会找到这里
Bony Express on't come around here.


132
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.420
他就在这里 让我们把他熏出来
He's here somewhere, boys.Let's burn him out!


133
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.350
下一个目标就是你的额头
Next one goes through your forehead.


134
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.350
嘿嘿 不要动手！
Hey, hey! No need to burn nothing, boys!


135
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.480
好久不见 老大
Howdy, boss.


136
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.880
Cicero...我退休了 你也不放过我
Cicero...you're not gonna let a man enjoy his retirement, are ya?


137
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:39.880
Frank  当然不是 你金盆洗手 我当然没有意见 只不过那笔钱...
No, Frank, I salute your decision to turn from your sinful ways.But the money...


138
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.750
是我们共同的财产
that belongs to all of us.


139
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:47.880
小子 你只要动手 我枪子儿里的子弹可手下不留情
Touch that steel, boy,I got plenty of bullets left over after I put one in...


140
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.820
第一个遭殃的就是你父亲
your father.


141
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.950
噢 看来你已经找到了你失散多年儿子 我也不想打扰你们的全家团圆的
Oh, you finally found your long lost son. Well, I sure hate to break up this nice family reunion.


142
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.950
那为何你不干脆把钱交出来 不然你就等着吃子弹吧
So, why don't you give us the money you stole before I put lead in your head.


143
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.420
钱已经被埋起来了
The money's buried.


144
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.550
儿子 不要多说
Way to run your mouth, son.


145
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.020
被埋起来了？
It's buried?


146
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.950
对 我把钱深埋在地下 在一架风车旁边
Yeah, I buried it.Deep in the ground...next to a windmill.


147
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:26.280
一架风车旁边？我操 这范围也太特么大了
A windmill in the West...doesn't narrow it down much, Frank.


148
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.480
这架风车不一样...它会唱歌
Well, this is a special windmill.It's a singing windmill.


149
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.820
你他妈当我傻逼呢？
A singing windmill!


150
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:43.620
从这里出发要10天 我答应带你去找钱 只要你保证...
It's about a ten-day ride from here.I'll lead you to it presently on one condition.


151
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:49.080
不要伤害我的儿子 和其他这些善良的印第安人
You don't hurt my boy...or any of these kindly Injuns here.


152
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.950
走 我们现在就出发
Let's ride, Frank.


153
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:12.420
如果到时候风车下面没有挖到钱 我会把你活埋 只露出头 让沙漠上的动物活生生地吃了你
Frank, if that $50,000 isn't under that windmill,I'm gonna bury you up to your neck and let the desert critters eat you alive.


154
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:18.680
我保证钱在那里 我很高兴我找到了我的儿子 
It's there, Cicero, it's there.I'm glad I got to meet Betty Dunson's son.


155
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.950
待在这里 好好的和你的未婚妻生活
You just stay here, Tommy.Enjoy your life with your beautiful bride...


156
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.220
在这些巨大的松树下面
amongst these majestic pine trees.


157
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.820
我们走！
Let's go!


158
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.820
我擦 这太不友好了
Well, that was uncool.


159
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.680
小白飞刀 你该休息了
White Knife, you must rest.


160
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:14.420
我怎能休息 如果到时他们到了风车那里 发现没有钱 会杀了我父亲的
How can I rest? When they get to the singing windmill and find no money, they will kill him.


161
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.280
孩子 松树太多 时间太紧迫了
My son, there are too many trees and too little time.


162
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.820
那我就要从其他途径获得这笔钱了
Then I must get this $50,000 another way.


163
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.680
什么途径 偷吗 这太不正直了
How? By stealing? There is no honor in that.


164
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:32.420
那我也可以从那些不正直的人那儿偷钱
Unless I steal from those who have no honor.


165
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.220
哦 这样就没什么问题了
Ooh... I like that.


166
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.350
但这样太危险了
But it is too dangerous.


167
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.280
我会派最勇敢的10名勇士帮助你
I will send ten of our strongest braves with you.


168
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.680
千万不要 印第安人在白人的世界里太危险了
No. The braves would be treated too cruelly in the white man's world.


169
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.150
莫事 很多勇士脸白 可以混淆过去 而且有个孩子还能很好地模仿白人的动作
A lot of them can pass for pale face. Raging Bear can actually do a great impression of a white guy.


170
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:55.350
让我们下会棋 再吃薯条吧
Hey, guys, let's play with our chest hair and eat potato chips.


171
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.880
不错吧 这不知道这熊孩子在哪里看到的
Wasn't that great? Where does he come up with this stuff?


172
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.880
是很不错 但是这事我必须一个人去了断
That's very good, Bear, but I must walk this path alone.


173
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:12.950
亲爱的 我会弄到钱 然后带去风车那里 等我回来参加我们的婚礼
My love... I will get this money...bring it to the singing windmill,and be back in time for our wedding.


174
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.950
我不会让你走的 这些人都是杀手
I won't let you go.Those men are killers.


175
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:26.420
我曾经的懦弱害死了母亲 这次我不会连累我父亲
I was a coward once and my mother paid the price.That will not happen to my father.


176
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.820
早上好
Morning


177
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.080
你从哪里冒出来的？
Where in the hell did you come from?


178
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:56.280
我遇到了点麻烦 我骑马到这里淘金 结果半路我的马死了
I'm in a bit of a bind, boys.I rode all the way out here to pan for gold and my horse up and died on me.


179
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.750
马怎么死的?
How'd he die?


180
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:06.680
自杀 在它小溪喝水的时候 头一直不抬起来把自己给淹死了 太惨了
Suicide. Drowned himself.Put his head in the stream and just kept it there.Saddest thing you ever seen.


181
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:11.480
常有的事 虽然不想承认 但这傻逼事就是会发生
It happens.Powers that be don't like to admit it, but it happens.


182
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.350
他看起来像是个诚实的白人 跳上来把
He looks like an honest white guy.Hop on.


183
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.750
感激不尽
Much obliged.


184
00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.950
我在最近的一个镇上下就可以了
Just drop me off at the nearest town.


185
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:34.550
女士先生们 来来来 这是我最新发明的护理精油 包治百病
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.Hear the wondrous effects of Dr.Chubb's Vita Oil,the miracle cure for 1001 ailments.


186
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.150
只要滴上一滴...你就马上...这谁啊这?
Put the pep back in your...Who's this asshole?


187
00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.750
看 那个人居然在马槽里面喝水
Well, now, look at this fella,drinking from the horse trough.


188
00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:02.820
那谁谁 你这样做 看着太让人作呕了
Excuse me.You there!What you're doing is disgusting.


189
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.880
这是牲口才喝的水
That water is for our filthy horses.


190
00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:11.620
水是大自然给我们的恩惠 谁都可以喝 对吧老兄？
Water flows from the sky spirit for all its children.Isn't that right, cousin?


191
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:17.620
你那些歪门邪说在我们这里不管用 明白？"老兄"
We don't cotton to that peyote-smoking nonsense around these parts.Do you hear me, "cousin"?


192
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.150
算了 William 别跟他废话
Okay,William, come on back.


193
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.880
喂 小伙子 你打算留在镇上吗？
Hey, amigo.You planning on staying in town?


194
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.350
可能需要一个地方躺会儿
Might need a place to lay my head for a bit.


195
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.550
刚才那个男人那样说你 太不像话了
Sorry about that ugly man that insulted you.


196
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.080
他开了家银行 觉得自己理所当然可以对人霸道无理
He runs the bank, so he thinks he's entitled to be mean to everyone.


197
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.950
镇上有家银行？
There's a bank in this town?


198
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.820
为何这样问 难不成你还想抢银行呢？
Why? You wanna rob it?


199
00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.480
夫人 我看起来难像抢银行的？
I look like a bank robber to you, ma'am?


200
00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.220
很奇特啊 你让我想起来某个银行抢劫犯
Funny, there's something about you that reminds me of a certain bank robber.


201
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.750
他的名字叫Frank Stockburn
His name was Frank Stockburn.


202
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.820
你认识Frank Stockburn？
You know Frank Stockburn?


203
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.220
认识？没有见过面那种?
 "Know"? Like, in the biblical sense?


204
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.820
不是 夫人 你以前亲自见过他吗?
No, ma'am. You've met him before is what I'm asking.


205
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.550
是的 我见过他
Yes, I met him.


206
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:16.280
认识他20分钟后 我在床上"见过”了他 就在那里
Then, 20 minutes later,I knew him in the biblical sense on that bed, right there.


207
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:22.420
接着 在这个扶手旁 我又“见过”了他2次
And, I knew him, in the biblical sense, twice on this railing.


208
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:28.150
然后 我们又倒立着"见面" 就在你靠着的梳妆台那里
And then, while doing a handstand on that dresser you're leaning against.


209
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.620
他有没有提起过一架会唱歌的风车？
Did he happen to mention a singing windmill?


210
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:39.480
他确实提起过一架会唱歌的风车 他说听起来就像天使的合唱一样
He did mention a singing windmill.He said it sounded like a choir of angels.


211
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.080
他有没有说风车在哪儿？
Where'd he say it was?


212
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:49.480
他说在那里 赢得了他人生中最大的一次比赛 然后就笑了
He said that it was in a place where he made his biggest score. Whatever that was,then he laughed.


213
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.220
他很喜欢笑
He liked to laugh...


214
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.280
还有倒立的性爱
and have handstand sex.


215
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.150
呃 这个可以pass掉
Yeah, we gotta get past that.


216
00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.350
我很想念他 不过他确实留下了一件纪念品
I miss him.But he did leave me something to remember him by.


217
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.080
什么纪念品？
What's this?


218
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.020
niño,Ramon.

219
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.350
我还有一个兄弟？
I have a brother?


220
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:18.020
Burro 好兄弟 我们在一起这么久了 虽然都在慢慢变老 但是我们一起经历的冒险旅途 都是宝贵的记忆
Oh, Burro, we had many adventures together, you and me.We're not getting any younger.At least we have our memories.


221
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:28.020
记得在南达科他州的那2个姐妹吗？ 我知道你喜欢更肥的那只 哈哈哈 不要不承认
Remember the two girls,the sisters, in Deadwood?You liked the fat one.You know it's true.


222
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.880
Ramon Lopez?

223
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.020
我是

224
00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:42.820
我刚刚见过你的母亲 结果... 偶然发现 你的父亲和我的父亲...
I just came from conversating with your mother, Esmerelda.We stumbled upon the fact that your dad and my dad...


225
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.880
是同一人...
are the same fella.


226
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.150
真是开门见山
Oh, that's neat.


227
00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.750
简洁如我
 Yeah


228
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.020
同一个父亲 那我们就是同父异母的兄弟 你怎么看 Burro?
Same father.Half-brothers.What do you think about that, Burro?


229
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:59.750
那么 我们父亲怎么样？
So, how is Dad?


230
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:07.350
他被绑架了 我需要筹够5万元 才能救他的命
Well, he went and go himself kidnapped,and I need to come up with $50,000 to save his life.


231
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.350
需要这么多银子？
That's a lot of pesos.


232
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.680
可不是吗 所以我决定抢劫镇上的银行
Sure is.That's why I'm fixin' to rob the bank here in town.


233
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.820
等一下 你意思是 我的父亲遇到了麻烦？
Hang on.My father is in trouble.


234
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.420
我的兄弟又需要我的帮忙
My brother, he needs my help.


235
00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.880
我和你一起去抢银行
I'll rob the bank with you.


236
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.880
我必须独自完成这事儿
I must do this alone.


237
00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.550
你要干嘛 兄弟
What's happening right now?


238
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:46.020
当我还是小孩子的时候 我就期待有一天见到我的父亲 一起吃饭 把他介绍给我的驴子朋友
Ever since I'm pequeño,I dream about spending one magical day with mi padre,sharing meals, introducing him to the burro.


239
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.750
除非你答应让我帮你 不然我不会松手的
I will not let go of you until you say I can help you.


240
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.950
如果你停止用刷子刷我 我就答应你
Will you stop brushing me if I say yes?


241
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.150
当然可以
Yes.


242
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.880
那你可以帮我忙
Then you can help.


243
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.820
它打屁意味着喜欢你
That means he likes you.


244
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:47.080
女士 你需要借的这笔款项不是小数目 通常情况下 我们会要求你出示2份证明
That's a good amount of money you want us to lend you.Now, normally, we would require two forms of identification, madam,


245
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.280
但是您这种大美女就不需要了
but that won't benecessary in your case.


246
00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.820
Burro 想到要从好人这里抢钱 我感到好愧疚
I feel kinda guilty about this, Burro,taking money from nice people.


247
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.950
你幸好不是那种看起来脏兮兮的墨西哥人
I mean, it's not like you're some greasy Mexican.


248
00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.820
突然感觉没那么愧疚了
I feel less guilty now.


249
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:08.820
你在干什么！这里是银行！赶紧把那头驴弄出去！
What are you doing?This is a bank!Get that donkey out of here!


250
00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.150
先生 这是美国西部小毛驴
It is a burro, señor.


251
00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.480
我不管这是什么傻逼玩意儿 “先生” 赶紧给我弄出去！
I don't care, "señor."Get it out!


252
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:18.950
行行 我们走吧...小毛驴不想走...
All right. Vámonos.The burro don't want to vámonos.


253
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.950
我才不管这头牲口想怎样！！
Well, I don't really care what the burro wants.


254
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.820
赶紧给我滚出去 你这个畜生！！！
Get out of my bank, you beast!


255
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:32.820
我知道你在想什么 但现在还不是时候 给我稳住
I know what you're thinking, but not yet.Hold it.


256
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:54.280
这个傻逼怎么会卡在这里 刚才它明明能从这里进来 现在怎么可能出不去了呢！！见了鬼了！！！
How is this jackass stuck?If it got in here, it can certainly get out!It doesn't make sense, it's not logical.


257
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.480
他们把钱藏的真好
They got it locked up good, do they?


258
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.080
我操 我不信还治不了你了！！！
Oh! You are leaving!


259
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.750
看啊 那个傻逼摔了个狗吃屎!
Gall dang, 1he felled on his pooper!


260
00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.550
这太特么不正常了!
That makes no sense!


261
00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.080
很...很抱歉...我马上弄它走...
I apologize.- I don't know how many times I could...


262
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.880
朋友好啊 需要我帮忙把它弄出来吗？
Hey, friend.Need any help gettin' her out?


263
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.550
她不是真的被卡住了 我的朋友 她只是用来分散注意力的
She's not really stuck,amigo.She's just a diversion.


264
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.880
她是处女？刚好我也是处男...
She's a virgin?I'm a virgin, too...


265
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.280
从不是很严格的意义上说
unless you count canty-loupes.


266
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:46.280
我相信你 小处男 听着 这头驴是用来分散银行老板注意力的 我的兄弟才好去偷银行的钱
I believe that, but she's a diversion to keep the banker busy so that my brother has time to rob the bank.


267
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.150
你们要抢银行?? 太牛逼了！!
You're robbin' the bank?Gall dang!


268
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.080
大事不妙！ Virgil 快吧钥匙给我！！
No! Virgil! Virgil, the key!


269
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.550
我的名字小皮特
叫I'm Lil Pete.


270
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.550
那你爸的名字就叫大皮特咯？
So, is your father, like, Big Pete?


271
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.880
我没见过我的粑粑 但他和你们一样都是银行抢劫犯 他叫Frank
I didn't know my pa.But he was a bank robber like y'all! His name was Frank.


272
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.620
姓Stockburn
Stockburn?


273
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.220
你怎么知道？？难不成你是巫师？？！！
How'd you know?Are you a wizard?


274
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:36.280
“儿子 我们会在Jawbone大瀑布那里等你 你的父亲留”
Frank Hey, Johnny Law.We'll be waiting for you up at Jawbone Falls.Frank Stockburn.


275
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.220
来人啊 来人啊 有人在抢银行！！！
Robbery!We're being burgled!


276
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.350
原来是你！！你就是那天喝我马槽水的那个人！！
You! Horse-water-drinker!


277
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.680
你被逮捕了！！
You are caught, sir!


278
00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.550
你特么到底谁啊！！
What are you?


279
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.020
大哥 你猜怎么着？我又找到了一个失散多年的弟弟
Hey, Tommy, guess what? We got ourselves a little brother.


280
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.280
都是 我们的母亲都被同一个抢银行的给哼哼了 是不是很赞啊！！
Yeah! All our moms got porked by the same outlaw. Ain't that a pip


281
00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.350
对 我很赞同
Yeah, that's something.


282
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.680
大家来看啊 这些土匪刚刚把银行抢了
Hey! Those bandidos just robbed the bank!


283
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.750
吃我枪子儿把 你们这些肮脏的外国佬
Taste my bullets, you dirty foreigners!


284
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:18.950
就是现在！！！
Now!


285
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.820
Burro 干的好！
Nice one, Burro


286
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:25.480
他们在那里！！
There they are!


287
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.420
我们得赶紧逃
We better make tracks.


288
00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.750
我能加入你们吗 我有辆马车
Can I come with? I got a wagon.


289
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.150
没问题 我觉得可以有 我们走！！
All right, that ain't a bad idea, let's go.


290
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.750
如果你们是我兄弟的话 你们是不是也和我一样 有3颗奶头？
So, if you guys are my brothers,you must got three nipples, too.


291
00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:36.950
我只有2颗
I only got two.


292
00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.680
对 我也只有2颗
Yeah, just got the two.


293
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.550
呃 那肯定是我妈遗传给我的 当我没说
Oh, must be from my mama's side.Forget I tolded you that, okay?


294
00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.280
莫问题呀
Will do.


295
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.620
Clem 你准备好了吗？
Are you ready, Clem?


296
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.080
恩恩 我准备好了...
Yep, yep. I'm... I'm ready.


297
00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:01.350
这勺子...看着真锋利啊...
Spoon. Damn sharp


298
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:16.950
听着大伙儿 我真的想和你们一起去追捕那个白人印第安人 但是我的眼睛有点问题
Look, fellas, I wanna hunt this white Injun down same as you.I have some problems with my eyes.


299
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.750
你如果想真心加入"左眼帮派"的话 你就必须挖出你的右眼
You wanna join the Left-Eye Gang,that right eye has gotta come out.


300
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.020
疼一会会就不疼了
It'll only hurt for a second.


301
00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.680
就是 就疼那么一小小会
Yeah, like a hundred seconds.


302
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.020
然后你就正式加入我们了
Then you're one of us.


303
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.620
一辈子的好基友
For life.


304
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.350
好吧 听起来有道理...
Okay, that makes sense.


305
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:44.420
我...能不能...把左眼挖出来 本来左眼视力就不是很好 但是右边的视力很好 如果挖掉的话是不是太可惜了...?
Is it okay if I scoop this left eye out?This is... I'm basically blind here.This right one sees like an eagle.Yeah, it just seems like a waste that I'd...


306
00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.950
我明白你的难处 但是这是规定
I understand your predicament but rules is rules.


307
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.880
好吧 这我了解...
Yeah, it... makes sense.


308
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.750
这样做是不是有点过分了...
That ain't right!


309
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.350
挖了一半掉在那里了 还连着血管...
It's half way there...dangled by a van


310
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.880
太疯狂了 这样我还看得见
It's crazy, I can still see out of it!


311
00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.350
天哪 我快吐了
I think I'm gonna puke.


312
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.550
像是黏在脱衣舞女奶子上的流苏一样
It's just going round and round like a tassel on a stripper's titty!


313
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.550
马上就好了 马上就好了
Ok gotta get it gotta get it


314
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.020
我不行了 我快晕了
I'm getting dizzy!


315
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.150
恭喜你成功了 欢迎成为我们左眼帮派的一员！
You done it, partner. Welcome to the Left-Eye Gang.


316
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.820
我做到了！
I did it!


317
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.750
太好了 我终于做到了！
I'm glad that's done.


318
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:43.080
现在我们一起去追捕那个喜欢印第安人的白人吧
Let's just go get that Injun-loving son of a bitch, huh?


319
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.350
赞同 我们现在出发吧
Yeah! Let's get him. Yeah.


320
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.620
哦 我不小心摸到眼窝了 操！
Oh, I touched the hole.I touched the hole!


321
00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.480
我现在也是有眼罩的人了
Got me a patch!


322
00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:03.750
亲爱的麻麻 自从我上次去买了一个冰淇淋后就消失了 你是不是觉得很奇怪捏
Dear Mama,you may be wondering why I have not returned from my trip to the ice cream store.


323
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:10.680
那是因为我遇到我的兄弟 Ramon 和 Tommy  我们现在准备去偷钱
It's because I met my brothers, Ramon and Tommy.And we're trying to steal money.


324
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:18.550
因为我们的粑粑被坏淫抓走了 带到了一架会唱歌的风车那里 所以我们需要钱去救他
We need the money to give to the bad men who took Pa away to the land of the singing windmill.


325
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:28.950
Tommy 说我们不能去偷正直人的钱 幸好西部有太多不正直的人了
Tommy says it's not okay to take money from decent folks. Luckily, there's a lot of bad people here in the West.


326
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.280
吃吧 享受地吃吧 我知道你喜欢的啦
Eat it! You know you like it.You know you like it.


327
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.280
我的个天
Good God!


328
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.280
真是一头"好"驴子啊
 Good burro!


329
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.080
对对对... 就这样...
That's right.Enjoy it!


330
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.350
这也太特么恶心了
That's just wrong.


331
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.080
这个萝卜比香瓜好使多了 哈哈哈
This is so much better than the cantaloupe.


332
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.150
哈哈哈哈 小毛驴真是好样的
Good burro!


333
00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:24.280
慢慢地 我们快筹集到了救粑粑的5万美金了 偶从来没见过这么多钱啊 妈妈
Slowly, but surely,we're chippin' away at the $50,000 we need to save Pa.That's a lot of money, isn't it, Mama?


334
00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:36.020
我在干什么？ 哦 哈哈哈 我想起来了 我给你写信 妈妈 哈哈 我已经迫不及待想见我的粑粑了
Mama? Oh, yeah, that's right.I'm writing you a letter.Anyways, I can't wait to actually meet my pa.


335
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:48.280
我想让粑粑教我如何生孩子 女淫们怎样拉屎屎的 我会尽快赶回来 爱你的蠢儿子
I want him to teach me how you make babies.And how the lady poops 'em out.Be home quick as I can.}Your loving son, Lil Pete.


336
00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:15.750
Tommy?

337
00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.150
肿么了？我的弱智弟弟？
Yeah, Lil Pete?


338
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.280
这个会唱歌的风车到底在哪里？
Where's the singing windmill?


339
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.350
粑粑在那里赢得了最大的一次比赛
It's where dad made his biggest score.


340
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:30.950
或许我们去Jawbone大瀑布那里可以找到一些线索 粑粑以前被通缉时经常躲在那里
Maybe we'll get another clue up at Jawbone Falls.That's where he used to hide out when he was an outlaw.


341
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:34.150
太棒啦！！
Oh, cool beans.


342
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:38.820
Tommy?

343
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.420
又怎么了 我的弱智蠢弟弟？
Yeah, Lil Pete?


344
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:46.420
如果我们被抓住了 是不是很麻烦？
If we get caught stealing...would we be in trouble?


345
00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.950
我们会被绞死的
I reckon we'll hang.


346
00:34:54.020 --> 00:35:00.280
恩...那我没什么问题了  我的脖子很结实的
Well... that's no bother.I got a real strong neck.


347
00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:06.680
以前我功课没有按时完成的话 妈妈就会惩罚我 把耕地的犁套在我脖子上 然后耕地
Mama makes me pull the plow with my head if I don't finish my schoolwork.Which occurs regularilly.


348
00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:14.950
硬脖子总有一天派上用场 我们现在睡了吧
Strong neck might come in handy.Okay, let's get our rest.


349
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.150
晚安啦 Tommy
Good night, Tommy.


350
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.280
晚安 蠢弟弟
Good night, Lil Pete.


351
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.150
晚安 Ramon
Good night, Ramon.


352
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.550
晚安 兄弟们
 Good night, brothers.


353
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.420
晚安 我的小毛驴
Good night, Burro.


354
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:35.080
打的屁是干的 明天会是个好天气
That's a dry one.We will have good dry weather tomorrow.


355
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.350
走开！ 该死的苍蝇！走开！！
Shoo, fly!Shoo!!


356
00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.220
赶紧走开 死苍蝇 不要打扰我们睡觉！
 Oh, come on, fly, vámonos! We need our sleep.


357
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.150
让我把它解决了
Let me take care of this.


358
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.820
黑漆漆的你怎么看得见？
How can you see a fly in the dark?


359
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.150
一个真正的猎者是感官并用的
A true hunter sees with all his senses.


360
00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:16.150
你真有一手 佩服
That was some mystical shit, man.


361
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.550
我觉得你刚才是把苍蝇的食物打掉了
I think you just nicked his biscuits off.


362
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.550
我就是这样做的
 That's what I was aiming for.


363
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.950
它用不着死 它需要知道的是它在这里并不受欢迎
He didn't deserve to die.He deserved to know he was not welcome here.


364
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:36.950
不愧是被印第安人抚养大的 你有着他们的思想
Raised by Indians, huh?That had some impact on you.


365
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:40.680
让我来解决这一只
 Well, let me get this one.


366
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.950
听起来像马蝇一样
Sounded like a horse fly.


367
00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:54.020
那不是马蝇 那是我的马！！
That wasn't a horse fly, that was my horse!


368
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:55.620
Peanut?

369
00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.420
Oh, Peanut!

370
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.750
现在我的小毛驴该遭殃了...
Oh, the burro's gonna be pissed.


371
00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.350
小毛驴 你做的很好 不要怕你旁边的马 你和它做的一样好！
You're doing bueno,Burro!Don't be intimidated by the horse,you're just as good as him.


372
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.750
哥哥们 我好饿啊！
I'm so hungry.


373
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:16.820
周围有很多吃的啊 坚果啊 浆果啊 树皮 以及各种泥土
There's breakfast all around.Nuts, berries, bark,different kinds of mud.


374
00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.680
如果附近有塔可树就好了
I wish there were taco trees.


375
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.420
塔可是什么东东？
What's a taco?


376
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:26.950
墨西哥煎饼卷 把肉末 起司 番茄酱都夹在薄皮卷里 超级好吃
They're the best.Meat and cheese and tomatoes in a crispy shell.You'd love it, man.


377
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:29.750
啊啊啊 我受不了了 我要一口气吃50个
Ooh, I want one. I want 50.


378
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:36.150
兄弟们 不得不打断你们 我们到了 Jawbone 大瀑布
 Hate to put an end to this fascinating conversation, but we're here, Jawbone Falls


379
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.950
旁边还居然有间房子
And there's a mansion next to it!


380
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.880
我们干脆直接进去吧
Should we just go in?


381
00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:52.680
我赞成
I reckon.


382
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.480
呵呵哒 这里看着真舒服
haha this is cozy


383
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.420
不要伤害我的哥哥们!!!
Don't hurt my brother!


384
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:18.680
不要怕 我们只是来找我们的父亲的
We don't mean no harm.just looking for our dad.


385
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:23.350
这是你的家吗？... 那这是谁的家？|
Is this your place?Whose place is it?


386
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.080
这是你的妈妈家？
Your mother?


387
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.350
噢 那她现在在家吗？
Oh, is she here right now?


388
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:39.620
哦 她已经去世了 我很抱歉 她肯定是位好母亲
Oh, she's dead.I'm so sorry, I'm sure she was a good woman.


389
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.420
她三年前去世的？
She died three years ago?


390
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.680
三个月前?!
Three months ago?


391
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.080
噢 我知道了 你妈妈有3个奶头！！
Oh, your mama has three nipples?


392
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.480
对对 我们有3个人
Yeah, there's three of us.


393
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.280
你和你妈妈不会是在这里非法酿酒吧？
You and your mom were making moonshine up here, huh?


394
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.880
你们非法酿的酒商标是...Frank Stockburn?!
Making moonshine for... Frank Stockburn?


395
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.880
你认识 Stockburn？
You know Frank Stockburn?


396
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.550
他在这里呆过？和你妈妈在一起过？
He slept here?With your mama?


397
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.820
哦哈哈 我看懂了 你的妈妈是只猫头鹰!
Your mama was an owl.


398
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:42.950
才不是呢 蠢弟弟 是我们的粑粑把她麻麻弄出了那样的声音
No, our dad made his mom make owl noises.


399
00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.280
很对 朋友 确切来说 应该是叫你 我们的兄弟
Yeah, that's right, friend.We're your brothers.


400
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:04.150
来来来 干杯 干杯 
Down the hatch, boys!Salud. Salud.


401
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.820
你有名字吗?
What's your name, anyways?


402
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:19.080
H... R... M...

403
00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.220
我们干脆叫你Herm好了
How 'bout we just call you Herm?


404
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:34.280
Herm 我们之所以来这 是因为我们的粑粑被坏淫们绑架了
Herm, so you know,our dad was kidnapped by some bad muchachos.


405
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:37.220
都是 我们需要大笔的银子赎回老豆
we need money to get him back


406
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.150
所以我们决定去偷钱
So we're going to steal the money.


407
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:45.750
准确来说 我们只去偷坏淫们的钱
No, we're only stealing the money from folks what are bad.


408
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:53.350
你知道附近有没有坏人 我们好去偷他们的钱？
So do you know of any place where we could steal a lot of money from some bad folks?


409
00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.150
大金块酒吧？
The Gold Nugget Saloon, huh?


410
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.820
你要和我们一同去吧
I reckon you're coming with us?


411
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.350
小狐狸担心小白飞刀 寝食难安 她必须得吃点东西
Smoking Fox so worried about White Knife.We must get her to eat something.


412
00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.280
哟 看谁在这里吃午餐呢
Oh, we having a little picnic here, huh?


413
00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.350
你们没有权利来这里 这是我们印第安人的地盘！
You have no right to be here! This Apache land!


414
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.880
那你又能怎么着我呢 海狸鼠？
And what you gonna do about it, beaver breath?


415
00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.620
他怎么知道我的名字？
How he know my name?


416
00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.480
我操 这真是她的名字！
That's really her name!


417
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:38.420
我觉得你应该叫“巫婆" "猪肉荣"或者是"呕吐脸"
Yeah, I think you also could havegone with "Face Like Witch."Or "Eats Like Pig."Or "Hit In Face With Diarrhea Stick."


418
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.280
没了 就这些绰号？ 没其他的了？
That's it? Nobody else?Babyface? Stumbles?


419
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:48.680
头儿 看啊！我抓住了谁！！！哈哈这下我们拿小白飞刀有辙了
Hey, boss!Look what I got here!He ain't gonna be happy about this.


420
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:05.220
这个小镇以前是很繁荣的 后来金子被挖完了 连火车都不运行了
Yep, used to be a prosperous town.Then the gold mine dried up and the train stopped stopping.


421
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:15.620
但是那家酒吧生意一直很好 从开业以来生意一直很好 从早到晚都是人 从来没有关门过
The saloon's the only place left that still does a good business.Open day and night since they built it. Ain't even a lock on the front door.It never closes.


422
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:24.820
他们在酒吧里面的壁炉里挂了一个很大的金块 人们总是来参观 据说金块至少值---20000美元
They got a big ol' golden nugget hanging above the fireplace.Folks come from all over just to take a look.They say it's worth about $20,000, easy.


423
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:35.350
我很惊奇居然没有人会去偷那块金子
I'm surprised no one's ever tried to stolen that nugget.


424
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:44.680
有人试过啊 但是没人成功过 酒吧吧台上挂的全部是失败者的手指 酒店老板干的事情 所以没人敢惹他
Oh, folks have tried.If you go in there, you see their thumbs hanging above the bar.Smiley Harris, the owner, bit them clean off.So nobody messes with Smiley.


425
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:50.820
感觉像搔痒痒一样
That sort of tickled.


426
00:43:51.080 --> 00:44:01.080
你有什么问题吗 打开你的袍子 我来瞧瞧...噢我从来没有看过这么大范围的皮疹 都感染成绿色了
What we got going over here, friend?Just open your robe, please.I have never seen that big of a rash...or infection or whatever this green bubble is.


427
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:27.480
骚年... 不论现在你在做什么... 都请停下来... 这样让我...我的手很难受...
Now, son, I would simply recommend that you stop doingwhatever it is you've been doing,with whoever...or whatever you've been doing it with.


428
00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:46.150
知道为什么叫酒店老板Smiley吗？因为无论当他在做任何残忍的事情时候 他脸上都挂着一种诡异的微笑
Yep, now they call him Smiley,'cause even when committing the most unspeakable atrocities,a cheerful grin never leaves his face.


429
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.750
OK 请把你的屁股太高
All right, just lift yourtail for me, please.


430
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:56.820
因为如此 金块才未曾偷过 也不会被偷
Now, he's why that nugget has never been stolen.And never will be stolen.


431
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.150
涂上这个可以预防感染
This'll prevent infection.


432
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.150
尝起来味道不错捏
It tastes good, too.


433
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:15.350
这个叫Smiley的人听起来倒像是一个当地恶霸
This Smiley fella, sounds more like a hooligan than a barkeep.


434
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:20.820
就是这么回事 传说他以前是和Frank Stockburn 帮派一伙的
You're not far off.Rumor has it that back in the old dayshe used to run with the Frank Stockburn Gang.


435
00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.080
要不要涂唇膏？
Lip balm?


436
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.020
不用了 谢谢
I reckon I'm good.


437
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:12.150
看来那个叫Smiley的人 不是那么简单
That Smiley fellow,he don't joke around.


438
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:16.420
噢  话说严重了 我平时很和蔼可亲的 只要不和我过不去
Oh... I joke around...but never when it comes to my business.


439
00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.420
欢迎来到我的“大金块酒吧”
Welcome to the Gold Nugget, gentlemen.


440
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:22.150
哈里斯先生 久闻大名
Mr. Harris, it's quite a nice spread you got here.


441
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:23.880
什么风把你们几位吹来了？
So what brings you gentlemen to town?


442
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:28.280
事实上 哈里斯先生 我们来想向您打听点消息
Actually, we wanted to ask you about something, Mr. Harris.


443
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:34.550
我现在正在同这几位先生谈话 等会再和你交谈
I am conversing with these gentlemen, sir.I shall be with you in a moment.


444
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.220
我需要和你谈谈Frank Stockburn
I need to talk to you about Frank Stockburn.


445
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.420
我已经有很多年没有听到过这个名字了
I haven't heard that name in many a year.


446
00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.150
这么说来你认识他
You know him.


447
00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.680
Stockburn先生和我以前是生意伙伴
Mr. Stockburn and I were business partners.


448
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:57.350
我这里有张照片 看 这是他 这是你 你当时是他帮派中的一员吧
I got a photograph.You see, that there's him...and that's you.You rode in his gang.


449
00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.820
准确来说 应该是我们共同的帮派
To be precise... it was our gang.


450
00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:07.220
他在黑帮派里混的很出名 我做的却是正派的生意 也很成功
He went on to a criminal career of some renown,while I achieved great success in the legitimate business world.


451
00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.420
请帮帮我
Please help me.


452
00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.950
先生 你这样做有点过分了
Sir, you are becoming a nuisance.


453
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.820
我需要告诉他我做过些什么
I just need to tell him what I've done.


454
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:42.020
老板 差不多了 再不停手就要出人命了
I think he's had enough, boss.


455
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:51.750
确实 各位不好意思 我也不想弄成这样
Yes.My apologies, gentlemen.Not my favorite subject.


456
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.020
下一轮酒全部免费
A round on the house.


457
00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:01.220
还有 Chico, 如果你下次再这样抓住我的手臂的话 我就让你吃6颗枪子儿
And, Chico, if you ever grab my arm like that again,I'll put six bullets in your head.


458
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.350
刚才你被打的好惨 没事吧？
That's quite a beating.Hope you and your drink are okay.


459
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:11.220
为什么你这么急切的想找到Frank Stockburn？
Why do you want to meet this Frank Stockburn so badly, huh?


460
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.350
因为他是我的父亲
Frank Stockburn's my father.


461
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:19.080
如果Frank Stockburn是你父亲的话 把手举起来
If Frank Stockburn is your father, raise your hand.


462
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.750
Chico是对的 到了晚上 人就少点了
Chico's right. Getting late, starting to thin out.


463
00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.420
兄弟们 想给你们说点事情 不想我们之间有秘密
Can I tell you guys something?Because I don't wanna have no secrets between us.


464
00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.620
-当然可以 -我们是兄弟嘛
-Of course. Yeah -we're brothers.Yeah.


465
00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:55.620
你们看 我父亲是白人 但是我母亲是黑人 所以我是黑白混血儿
Now, I know Dad is a white man, but my mother...was actually black.So that, technically,makes me half-black.


466
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.080
你确定 兄弟？
Is that right?


467
00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:04.550
我不想隐瞒你们我是黑人 不是纯种的白人 是不想以后你们无意中说出种族歧视的话
Well, I didn't wanna hide that from you in case you guys slipped up and made some racial slurs not knowing I wasn't 100% white.


468
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:10.680
我敢肯定你母亲很健壮 但是我不确定 她居然是个黑人
I mean, I knew she must've been really muscular,but I had no idea she was black.


469
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.150
既然你提起来了 我觉得你母亲好像就是黑人
Yeah, I mean, I guess,now that you mention it,I see it a little bit.


470
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:16.420
我的母亲是瑞典人
My mother's Swedish.


471
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.680
我不这么认为 我觉得她应该是墨西哥人
I don't think so. I reckon she's Mexican.


472
00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.480
特么的 居然敢骗我
Lying bitch!


473
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:29.220
那么我的兄弟们 你们有什么本事 今天晚上能够帮上忙的？
So do you new brothers have any special skills that could help us out here tonight?


474
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:30.680
比如说呢？
Like what?


475
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:37.480
比如 Tommy是个用刀能手 小皮特有三个奶头 我有一头小毛驴
Like, you know, Tommy'sgood with knives. Lil Pete's got a bonus nipple.I got a burro.


476
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.080
Herm能一手把人给掐死
Herm is good at strangling.


477
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:45.080
我能在水下憋气6分钟
I can hold my breath for six minutes.


478
00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.220
我能用鸡巴弹钢琴
Well, I can play the piano with my dick.


479
00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:55.480
那么 我们就所向无敌了 我需要你们这些帅小伙来帮忙偷那块大金子

事实上我听见了
I did.


493
00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:59.480
我有点糊涂了 今天晚上是周五 墨西哥菜之夜吗 还是队列舞蹈之夜？
I don't know, maybe I'm turned round.I thought that, like, tonight was gonna be Fajita Friday or line dancing or something.

516
00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:45.080
忘了告诉你 要有刀才能做那个动作...

517
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.880
都是 不好意思 我忘鸟...
Yeah, that makes sense.


518
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.480
酒店老板疯了 看见谁都在射击

我们是Stockburn兄弟
We are the Stockburn brothers.


522

Frank的孩子们？...呵呵呵...这变得越来越有意思了
Frank's kids?Well... this is interesting.


523
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:37.350
我最后见你们的父亲是在犹他州 当时我们干了一笔大买卖 
You know, the last time I saw your father was in Utah.Just rang up our biggest score.


524
00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:43.220
结果我们在分赃的时候 有了分歧
But when we was dividing it up,we started having trouble with the arithmetic.


525
00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:52.150
结果后来我被像狗一样扔在了一架风车旁 肚子上插了一把刀
And somehow I ended up abandoned beside a windmill,knife stuck in my guts,left to die like a dog.


526
00:55:52.280 --> 00:56:02.280
Frank把所有的钱都卷跑了 但是现在上天给我报仇的机会...我要亲手杀了他可笑的5个孩子...
Frank had taken it all.But now, I get to take something.The lives of his five ridiculous sons.


527

他向他自己的头开了6枪！！！
He's giving himself six bullets to the head!


529
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:37.350
他的头还在笑！
And he's still smiling!


530
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:50.950
其实我只是想把他敲晕而已
I was just trying to knock him out.


531
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:54.020
恭喜你 你成功了
Well, you succeeded.


532
00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.350
只不过你把他“敲晕”以后 他不会醒过来了
I don't think he's waking up from that one.


533
00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:26.950
来 Danny 这是古老的印第安疗法
Here you are, Danny.It's an old Apache remedy.


534
00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.880
擦擦你的头 在宿醉以后最有效了
Clears your head after too much firewater.

You know everything, Tommy.Where'd you learn all this stuff?


536
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:37.480
我的父亲教给我的
My father taught me.


537
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:40.820
父亲？不会吧！你不是上个星期才见到他的吗？
Dad? I thought you just met him last week.


538
00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:43.220
不是我们的生父 是我的养父
Not our father. Screaming Eagle.


539
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:50.280
他从小抚养我成人 是我见过的最善良最智慧的人
He raised me since I was a kid.He's the kindest... wisest man I've ever known.


540
00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:54.280
哇 有粑粑的赶脚真好
 wow must've been nice to have a dad.

544
00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:11.350
我们马上就可以见到他了
And we're gonna see him real soon.


545
00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.880
恩 我都等不及要见他了
Yeah... I can't wait.


546
01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.960
不用担心 我去看看怎么回事
ok boys I'm gonna check this out.


547
01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:23.520
你们要这样拿着球 腿弯曲 然后把球扔出去 准备好了吗？！
The ball is in your hand, twist the leg, then you let it go!Now, let me see. Ready, men?


548
01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:29.200
不是这样的！！认真听我说 你们这些亚洲人
No, no, no!You're not listening to me, Hung Shin!


549
01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:36.600
你们必须动作准确 准确 再准...听见了吗
You have to be very precise.Precise...I say!


550
01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.980
嘿 那边那群小伙子 我有一个提议 
You there!I have a proposition.


551
01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:47.620
要不一起来才参加一个即将诞生的伟大运动？
How would you men like to participate in the birth of something extraordinary?


552
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.740
不好意思 我们没时间 但是我们把你的球捡到了
Well, we ain't got time for that, but you can have your brown thing back.


553
01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:57.760
什么事情如此重要 你们不知道错过的是什么? 历史的见证时刻
What's so damnably important that you need to miss your rendezvous with history?


554
01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.700
我们要去救我们的粑粑   Frank Stockburn
We gotta save our daddy, Frank Stockburn.


555
01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.320
Frank Stockburn 那个亡命之徒?
Frank Stockburn, the outlaw?


556
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.660
你认识我们的父亲？
 You know our dad?

 I played him in Ezekiel Grant's annual Valentine's Day game down in Yuma.


559
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:17.380
你们父亲连眼都没眨一下 就赢了几千美元
Thousands of dollars on the table, but Stockburn doesn't bat an eyelash.


560
01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.300

Over in Utah? A guy named Smiley Harris?


562
01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.820
这样吧 我和你们做个交易

563
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.340
帮我一个忙 我就会告诉你们我全部知道的
Help me out a bit and I'll tell you all I know.


564

Deal. Tommy Dunson.


565
01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:37.480
我叫Abner Doubleday 我们开始吧！
Abner Doubleday. Let's play ball.


566
01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:52.960

Welcome, my friends, to the first ever playing of a new sport. A sport of my own devising.


567

On this field, two ten-person teams will engage in a battle of...


568
01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.860
有什么问题吗 奇先生？
Yes, Qi?


569
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.500
我们这里只有18个人
Only 18 people here.


570
01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:11.160
每队分为9人 比赛内容考验大家的力量 速度 和策略
Two nine-person teams will engage in a battle of strength, speed, and strategy.


571
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:21.420
一队人进行防守 另外一队人用球进攻
One team will go out onto the field to play defense while the other team will take turns hitting this ball...


572
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.240
用木棍击打球
with a stickie.


573
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.340
这个比赛名称叫什么？
What are you gonna call this game?


574
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.100
还能叫什么？
What else?


575
01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.860
Stickie McSchnickens.

576
01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:38.620
每队的投球手的目标就是 我2次没有击中球 就赢了
Now your goal, ball thrower, is to get the ball past me two times without my hitting it.


577
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:41.700
准备好了就开始吧
Fire when ready.


578
01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:49.760
我没想到你扔球的速度挺快的 好吧 没办法
I didn't know you were going to toss it quite so hard, ball thrower.All right.


579
01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.500
好了 已经2次了 你输了 对吧？
Okay, that's two past ya. So you're done, right?


580
01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.580
不行 我说了要得3次才行
No, no, I said three times.


581
01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.240
不是 你说的就是2次
No, you said two.


582
01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.500
不是！我说的是3次！3次击打成功我才出局！
I said three! Three strikes and I'm out.


583
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.960
我知道我说的什么 矮侏儒 (棒球里的游击手)
I know what I said, shortstop.


584
01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:14.380
这是你的新名字 矮侏儒 对 就这个 你以后就叫这个名字了 永远不能改
That's your new name. Short Stop, that's right.Now and forever. Forever and ever!


585
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.060
矮侏儒 矮侏儒 矮侏儒 矮侏儒
Short Stop. Short Stop, Short Stop.Short Stop.


586
01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.720
OK 我们开始下一轮吧
Yes, all right.


587
01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.540
第3次击打成功！你出局了！！
Strike three! You're out!


588
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.800
不 不行 这个球扔的高度太低了
No, no, the ball was... too low.


589
01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:33.400
要成功算接到一球的话 这个球的高度必须在...
In order for it to count as a strike, it has to pass through the...


590
01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.220
击打范围之内
strike zone.


591
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.040
-击打范围之内？- Strike zone?
-是的 就是这样- That's right.


592
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:41.560
如果你击打球的高度不在我的膝盖和我胸部之间的话...
And if you don't get the ball past me, between my knees and my titties,


593
01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.740
就不算成功扔球...就不算成功接球
it's not a strike....It's a non-strike.


594
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:49.500
如果你连着4次击打都不成功 那么我就毫不用力地赢得了第一垒
And if you throw me four non-strikes,I get an express ticket to first base without my even hitting it.


595
01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.440
好勒 我们开始吧
All right, are we ready?


596
01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.200
你犯规了 这样我也...赢得了第一垒
That also gets me to first base...as well.


597
01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.720
你往哪儿跑 没人击中球啊？
Where you going? Nobody hit it.


598
01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:16.060
我把垒给盗了 你没注意 我把它给盗了
I stole the base. You weren't looking, so I stole it.


599
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.280
你说过只有当你成功击中球的时候 你才能往前跑
You said you could only advance after you hit the ball!


600
01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.580
但是盗垒的时候...不算
Not when you're stealing.


601
01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.940
真是胡说八道
That's bullshit.


602
01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.560
别冒泡 你这个矮侏儒
Okay, Short Stop.


603
01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.500
他在你背后动了
He's moving!


604
01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:46.660
我没动！
Safe!


605
01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.620
这下好了 我们应该打成平手了
Gall dang, I don't know.That was a tie.


606
01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:58.320
就是 我们打成平局了！
Yes, and tie goes to the runner!


607
01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.160
为何是这样的
Why's that?


608
01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:04.120
因为这个比赛规则是我一手创建的 这就是原因
Because those are the rules of Stickie McSchnickens, that's why.


609
01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.830
成功了 我成功了！
All right, it's all mine, I've got it!


610
01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:16.560
不是 根本不是这样！ 你不能跑 根据...内野高飞球规则
 No! No, you can't run. You cannot run.Infield fly rule... in full effect.


611
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.440
你犯规出局了
You're out.


612
01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.460
我才不会过去捡
Oh, I'm not getting that.


613
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.560
你应该环绕所有垒包跑 因为你打出了全垒打
You can just run all the way home. A home runner.


614
01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:45.260
我需要一杯冷饮 我们中场休息5分钟 然后接着打下半场
I need a cold drink.Let's take a five-minute stretch and then start the second half.


615
01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.080
Doubleday先生 我们真的不能陪你玩了
Mr. Doubleday, we're done.


616
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.220
但是我们才打9局啊
But we've only played nine innings.


617
01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.020
9局足够了 我们的父亲在哪里赢得他人生中最大的比赛的
Nine innings is enough. Tell us about Dad's biggest score.


618
01:06:53.460 --> 01:07:01.020
那好 你们父亲和他的帮派 打败了一个120人的骑兵队
Fine.Your father and his gang knocked off an entire cavalry regiment, 120 men,


619
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.460
并且扛走了足足5大箱美元钞票
five trunks filled with Yankee money.


620
01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.240
在哪里发生的？
Where'd that happen?


621
01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:12.880
一直朝着正前方走 100英里 在一个叫“甜蜜之猪”的岩石旁边 到了那里你就看到了
Up at Sweet Hog Rock...100 miles due north.You'll know it when you see it.


622
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:18.630
好吧 兄弟们 看来我要在那块岩石旁边找到 会唱歌的风车了
Well, fellas,looks like we're going to Sweet Hog Rock to find ourselves a singing windmill.


623
01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.750
但是我们还差1000美元啊
But we still need another 10,000 bucks.


624
01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.910
那我们就还要干上一笔了
I reckon we'll make a quick stop, then.


625
01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.950
在你们离开之前 你们想不想和对方握手并且说“干的好 兄弟”？
Before you go...do you wanna line up and shake hands and say "good game" to each other?


626
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:29.000
不想
No.


627
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.500
那群小伙子其实人不错 当时给我现金就走人了 也没闯什么祸
Them boys were nice fellers.Paid in cash. Kept the profanity to a minimum.


628
01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.500
你确定？ 我听说有个墨西哥人用铲子把这个恶霸的头都给砍了下来？
And the Mexican brother knocked this hard-ass' head off with a shovel?


629
01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.630
这个老鬼的头足足被铲飞了40英尺
Dang thing flew nearly 40 feet!


630
01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.260
都还在笑
And still a-smilin'.


631
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:45.540
我天 我去！！！
Oh! Man!


632
01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.630
直到现在都在笑
And hasn't stopped yet.


633
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:56.680
不会吧...大哥... 用胶水能粘的起来？
Oh, hell, no! My man gluing on heads and shit!


634
01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.280
希望到时候我鸡巴断了 他能给我粘的回来
Wish he'd glue the head back on my pecker.


635
01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.800
你的小鸡吧怎么了？
What happened to your pecker?


636
01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:05.360
我当时参加这个帮派之前 是混另外一个帮派的 在德州发生了一些不愉快的事情
I was part of another gang before I joined up with y'all.Texas Stubbies.


637
01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:08.380
我说你们都不用愁了
Okay, never mind all that. Okay?


638
01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:13.160
医生 告诉我们 那6个蠢货往哪个方向走了？
Now, Doc, you know which way them there Ridiculous 6 rode off to?


639
01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.060
我们有一个朋友 需要和他们碰面
We're traveling with a friend of theirs who, uh... will be real excited to see them.


640
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:23.300
他们往绿松石山脉去了 我给你们在地图上指指
Well, they headed up north to the Turquoise Trail.I can show you on the map over here.


641
01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:31.740
小狐狸 急着去见你老公吗？没用的 到时候他会跪地向我们求饶的
Looking forward to seeing your man beg for his life?'Cause that's what's gonna happen, Smoking Fox.


642
01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.880
你老公就是个胆小鬼
Chicken pox!


643
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:37.260
我们马上就要找到他了 谁让他给印第安人一伙儿
We're gaining on his Injun-loving ass every day.


644
01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.180
和我们左眼帮派  作对的下场就是：
He messed with the Left-Eye Gang!He's gonna be like,


645
01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:46.820
"你们如何找到我的？...你们怎么抓住我老婆的？“
"Wait, how did you find me, and where...How did you get my girl?"


646
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:51.580
到时候这个愚蠢的小白飞刀就会意识到一切都太晚了 哈哈哈
And then old Dumb Knife's gonna realize that he's in way over his head.


647
01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:57.910
当时华盛顿创建了美国的时候...
See, when George Washington invented America...


648
01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:19.200
你好 警官 这个镇上有教堂吗?
Excuse me, Sheriff. Is there a church in this town?


649
01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:26.140
怎么可能有？这里是美国西部最乱 最邪恶 最混乱的小镇
最This is Rattler's Gulch, you halfwit.The meanest, crookedest, most hellacious town in the West.


650
01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:29.980
我们不需要那些牧师来告诉我们该做什么 不该做什么
We don't need no preacher telling us what we can and cannot do.


651
01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.720
那是不是我就可以这样对你的老婆？
So it's all right if I do this to your wife?


652
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:57.550
绞我的时候 我都迫不及待想看你们的表情啦！！
I can't wait to see all you nice people when I'm dangling!


653
01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.680
你这个变态的混蛋 赶紧把他给绞死
You sick bastard.Get this over with.


654
01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.600
今天便宜你们了 等会好好看我表演哦
You're in for a real treat today. This is gonna be so much fun.


655
01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.830
我和你们闹着玩儿的 我特么好着呢
I'm just messing with y'all. I'm fine!


656
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.660
我把介个动作叫做“脱离水的鱼"
I call this one Fish Out of Water.


657
01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:52.380
Herm 把妓女们放回去...快点！！！
Herm, put the hookers back.Come on!


658
01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:00.520
哈哈哈 你们抓不到我的 哈哈哈
Yeah, you can't catch me!


659
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.260
你看看 他根本不会死 他在戏弄你!!!
Look at him. He ain't dying, Billy! He's making a fool of you!


660
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:11.150
够了 我们开枪把这个傻逼打死！！
All right, that's it!We'll shoot the son of a bitch!


661
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.680
听我的指令 准备...
On my command!Ready


662
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.070
风把绳子吹歪了 我们就差一点就够着他了！
Wind took him, Tommy. Came damn close.


663
01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:30.420
我莫事儿 甭管我...！
I'm okay!


664
01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:34.860
我们成功了！！
We did it!


665
01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:41.900
给你说过我脖子很结实吧 呵呵哈哈奥！
I told ya I got a strong neck!


666
01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:59.920
我们必须比他们提前到达红猪岩石 而且还要找到会唱歌的风车才算了事
We still gotta get to Sweet Hog Rock before they do.Gotta find that singing windmill, so it ain't over yet.


667
01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:05.140
我们终于把钱弄齐了！是我们6兄弟一起干的！！！耶耶耶！！！！！！！
We got the money!The Ridiculous 6 got all the money!


668
01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.550
Tommy! Tommy! 父亲是怎样一个人 他幽默吗？
Tommy! Tommy! What's Dad like? Is he funny?


669
01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:12.080
是好的倾诉对象吗？
Yeah, is he a good listener?


670
01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.420
他强壮吗？
Is he strong?


671
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:21.200
你们问的都很好  我这样给你们说吧
All great questions. I'll tell you this.


672
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:27.660
我觉得你们肯定会喜欢父亲的 而且父亲也会很爱你们
I think you guys are gonna love him.But I'm sure he's gonna love you guys.


673
01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.680
真不好意思打扰这个温馨的场面
So sorry to interrupt such a tender moment.


674
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:36.070
好像我们打扰人家洗澡了
Looks like we stumbled on bath day, boys!


675
01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:40.460
硬汉们 我听说一路上你们认了不少兄弟是伐 
I heard you picked up some brothers along the way, tough guy.


676
01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.380
但是我发现你们怎么长的一点都不像呢？
But I don't see no resemblance.


677
01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.790
我觉得倒是挺像 都长得像我的屁股眼儿 哈哈哈
I do, they all look like my butthole.


678
01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:51.030
兄弟们 猜猜我们要对他们干什么？
So guess what time it is, boys?


679
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:52.780
报仇时间到！
Payback time!


680
01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.140
有任何遗言吗 小白“没”刀？ 哈哈哈
Any last words, No Knife? [Laughs]


681
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:04.510
给你们说过我憋气时间很长的！
I told ya I could hold my breath good.


682
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.100
干得好 Danny 小子！！
Yeah, Danny boy!


683
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:08.400
你还在干嘛 我们得走了！
What are you doing, man?We gotta go!


684
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.820
钱是我们的！！！！！
 That's ours!!


685
01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.420
Rusty！！！我的马儿 快肥来！！！
Rusty? Rusty no!! come back!


686
01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:41.150
现在我们怎么救粑粑啊 钱全部没了 还得重新筹
How are we gonna save him? We're startin' all over.


687
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:43.830
有没有其他地方我们还可以抢劫钱的？
Is there any more good places we can rob?


688
01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.230
比如附近有喂驴子或者给她穿驴掌的地方?
You know like a burro-grooming place or a shoe store for burros?


689
01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.500
西部一半的警力都在追捕我们
Half the lawmen in the west are already looking for us.


690
01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:55.120
那又怎样 我们不能停下来就范 我们父亲会没命的
So what? Look, we can't stop.They're going to kill him!


691
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:58.100
没用的 他已经快不行了
Ain't no difference. He's dying anyways.


692
01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.270
父亲生病了
Dad's sick.


693
01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.400
对不起我没给你们说 很有可能他现在已经死了
I'm sorry I didn't tell y'all.There's a good chance he's dead already.


694
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:16.190
但是有可能父亲还没死呢 Tommy 我们必须去见他
But there's a chance he's not.You got to meet him, Tommy.


695
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:20.780
我们就算只能见到他5分钟 也算是值了
The rest of us...Even if it was just for five minutes, it'd be worth it.


696
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:26.400
如果我不向父亲倾诉我的秘密的话 我会死不瞑目的
If I don't talk to Dad, I'll die with this dirty secret burnin' a hole in my guts.


697
01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:31.430
Danito 无论你做了什么 你都要原谅自己
Danito, whatever it is you did, you have to forgive yourself, man.


698
01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.830
如果你知道我做了什么 你就不会这样说了
You wouldn't say that if you know what I done.


699
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:35.500
Danny 每个人都有秘密
Everybody's got secrets, Danny.


700
01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:41.110
我就只跟你们说了我是黑人 这种感觉超爽
You guys are the first people I told I was black.You know how good that made me feel?


701
01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.040
我们是你的兄弟 你可以给我们讲任何事情
We're your brothers.You can tell us anything.


702
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:54.630
我曾经为美国总统工作
I used to work for the President of the United States.


703
01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.260
我曾是他的个人保镖
I was his personal bodyguard.


704
01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:03.060
在一个夜晚之前 我都是他最好的保镖
One of the best.Till one night...


705
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:11.760
总统先生 我想去上个卫生间
Mr. President, say, I'm gonna go hit the little boys' room.


706
01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.140
你特么在逗我吧？
Are you shitting me?


707
01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.340
不要担心 没事儿的 就一小会
Come on! You'll be fine, superstar.


708
01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:19.780
回来给你带点儿什么？水还是啤酒？
Can I get ya something on the way back? Agua? Brewski?


709
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:20.980
什么都不需要！
No!


710
01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.200
林肯夫人 我给您带点饼干或者一个枕头吧 这场秀挺长的
Mrs. Lincoln, how about one of them big pretzels or a little pillow?I hear this play's kind of a long one.


711
01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.870
那好吧 我马上就回来
All right, fair enough.I'll be back in two.


712
01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.540
总统先生的包厢在哪里？
Where's the president's box?


713
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:41.200
你是那个演员John Wilkes Booth吗？
John Wilkes Booth, the actor?


714
01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.940
这么巧 我是你的忠实粉丝！
No way, man! Big fan!


715
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.480
你是来见总统先生的吗？
You wanna say hi to the president?


716
01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.850
他正在里面欣赏表演呢 左手边最后一间
He'd get a real kick out of that.Last door on the left.


717
01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.020
哇哦 好喜欢这个演员
Wow! Love that guy!


718
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.860
"伤害了那么多人以后 你居然可以过得逍遥自在？"
How can you go on living your life knowing you harmed so many people?


719
01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.420
我就想问父亲这个问题
That's what I wanna ask Dad.


720
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:17.400
嘿 别难过了 又不是你开的枪
Hey, you ain't the one who pulled that trigger.


721
01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:24.380
如果你真的需要问父亲这个问题的话...我们就去筹集钱吧
But if Dad's gotta be the one who tells you that...then let's go get that money.


722
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.300
只不过我现在不知道在哪儿去弄这笔钱
I just wish I knew how.


723
01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.870
Herm有个主意
Herm's got an idea.


724
01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:34.200
他就是不知道如何表达
He just can't express it.


725
01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:38.240
如果这里有人能听懂他说的话就好了
I just wish somebody here could speak Herm.


726
01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:46.950
明天是情人节
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.


727
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:51.410
Ezekiel Grant会举行一年一度的赌注很大的扑克牌比赛
That's when Ezekiel Grant has his annual high-stakes poker game.


728
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:55.710
那里将有大量的钱 数不清的钱！！
There'll be oodles of money there. Oodles, I say.


729
01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.470
我不确定这个方案是否可行 听起来很冒险
I don't know. That sounds risky.


730
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.120
什么很冒险
What's risky?


731
01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:05.020
他提出我们去抢Ezekiel Gran开设的扑克牌比赛上的赌金
He's suggesting we... knock off Ezekiel Grant's poker game.


732
01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.030
在亚利桑那州 明晚
It's in Yuma tomorrow night.


733
01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.240
我们走半天就能到\Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.

734
01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:12.220
那个比赛 足足有一支军队在站岗
That poker game, there's practically gonna be an army protectin' it.


735
01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.740
如果Tommy说我们能够打败他们 我绝对相信他
If Tommy says we can beat'em, I'll believe him.


736
01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.590
我们都会相信他
We all will.


737
01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:25.520
我们能够打败他们 为了父亲
We can beat 'em...for Dad.


738
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:26.930
为了我们的父亲！
 For Dad!


739
01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:46.050
Ezekiel 我希望你能喜欢我为你准备的情人节礼物
I hope you like the gift I'm giving you for Valentine's Day, Ezekiel.


740
01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:50.690
给你个提示吧 一个小时的免费按摩服务
I'll give you a hint. one-hour massage, no charge.


741
01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.700
噢 Susannah 你知道我最需要什么礼物吗？
Oh, Susannah.You know what gift I'd really love?


742
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:57.620
你他妈给老子闭嘴 臭婆娘！
If you would just shut up!


743
01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:05.140
你这个娘们儿一直发牢骚 会毁了我的扑克牌比赛兴致的
Nothing ruins a good poker game more...than a lady jabbering on and on...


744
01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:06.300
太特么浪漫了
How romantic.


745
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:13.740
别来无恙啊 Custer长官
Well, General Custer!


746
01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.230
很高兴见到你
Yes, at your service.


747
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:16.680
你好 马克吐温先生
Mr. Mark Twain.


748
01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.850
正是在下
Word up!


749
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.860
先生们 请进
Gentlemen, do come in


750
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:23.030
最近还好吗 我刚才还和这位长官谈到我的新书
Yo, Zeke, big boy, I was just going off to the General here about my new book.


751
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:25.050
是《汤姆历险记》的续集
It's a sequel to Tom Sawyer.


752
01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.480
是关于他的朋友的故事 名叫《费恩历险记》
It's about Sawyer's home slice, Huckleberry Finn.


753
01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.720
一个白人男孩儿和他朋友的水上漂流记 人们为这个故事疯狂的！
White boy goes raftin' with a brother.People gonna lose their shit!


754
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.980
Custer长官 你的漂亮的金色头发长出来了
And, General Custer, I see you've let your dashing blond hair grow out.


755
01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:41.170
就是 军队里面的理发师手艺太差了
Well, yes, the barber down at the regiment is just awful,


756
01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.530
所以要么我就留长发 要么我情愿他们剥我头皮
so I had two choices, either let it grow or get scalped.


757
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:47.000
我是绝对不允许这种事情发生的
And I ain't gonna let that happen.


758
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.560
我们的老朋友待会儿会来吧？
Now, will our old friend from Tombstone be joining us?


759
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:57.480
他等会就来 但是今天我们有位新的参赛者 来自墨西哥的一位富人 他经营咖啡豆农场
Late as usual.But we have a new player, a wealthy Mexican coffee bean rancher.


760
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:58.650
先生们 我没迟到吧？
Am I tardy-o?


761
01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:01.810
噢 吓了我一大跳 你什么时候来的
Oh.neaky little Mexican.


762
01:19:02.970 --> 01:19:05.130
先生们 这位是...Don Don Diego
May I present Don Don Diego.


763
01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:14.430
我们这里是来参加扑克牌比赛的 你后面的2位保镖没有必要陪同吧
We run a gentleman's game here, Mr.Diego.Your, uh, two bodyguards are completely unnecessary.


764
01:19:14.410 --> 01:19:18.470
保镖？才不是 先生们 你们误会了
Bodyguards? You're mistaken, General.


765
01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:24.830
这位是...Chimichanga 我的管家仆人
This is, um...Chimichanga... my loyal manservant.


766
01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:27.840
愿主保佑你
God bless you.


767
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:32.320
还有....这位是Blanco Beardio
And...Blanco Beardio.


768
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:37.320
他负责今天下午比赛场上的娱乐项目演奏
He'll be providing the entertainment for this afternoon's festivities.


769
01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.870
那先给我来一首吧
Well, drop me a beat.


770
01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:02.220
先生们 每次的赌金筹码都是1万5千美元
Gentlemen, the buy-in is $15,000.


771
01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:03.580
1万5千美元?
Fifteen large?


772
01:20:03.690 --> 01:20:05.660
你确定“饼干”先生能付得起这个价吗？
Are you sure General Custard can swing that?


773
01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:10.060
我名字叫Custer 不是Custard 后面没有字母D 我又不是甜点
It's Custer, not "Custard." There is no "D." I'm not a dessert.


774
01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.990
嘣! 我刚刚是故意洗你娃儿脑壳的 哈哈哈
Boom, I just dropped some satire on your ass, General!


775
01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.050
妹啊 被你算计了！
You got me!


776
01:20:16.810 --> 01:20:21.040
当Ramo给我们暗号的时候 我们就开始行动
Hey! Now, when Ramon gives the signal that the time is right, that's when we move in.


777
01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.110
你丫还记得暗号是什么吧？
You remember the signal, right?


778
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.620
先生们好
Gentlemen.


779
01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:31.090
长官 比赛还是老地方
You know where to go, Marshal.


780
01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:35.010
我天 不会吧 那人是  Wyatt Earp！！
Oh, hell, no!That's Wyatt Earp!


781
01:20:35.150 --> 01:20:36.890
西部最快的枪手？
The fastest gun in the West?


782
01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:41.740
先生们 我来了 我来了！
All right, all right, all right!


783
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:45.090
噢！Wyatt Earp 你终于来了！ 我等到花都谢了！
Oh, Wyatt Earp, as I live and breathe!


784
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.300
对不起 各位 我来晚了
Sorry I'm late, everybody.


785
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:52.240
但是现在外面有一群新团伙 到处抢钱 惹麻烦
But apparently, there's some new gang out there robbing everybody blind.


786
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:54.420
他们还给自己取了个名字 叫可笑6人帮
Oh, they call themselves the Ridiculous 6.


787
01:20:54.590 --> 01:21:01.530
这个地方 你行走不到5英里 就会遇见各种亡命徒 响尾蛇 印第安人...
I swear, a man can't ride five miles in this territory without running into outlaws,rattlesnakes, Injuns and...


788
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:04.520
嘿！印第安人我来担心就够了！
Hey! Why don't you let me worry about the Injuns?


789
01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:06.860
恭敬不如从命 哈哈哈
 Will do, General.


790
01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.640
最近怎样啊 吐温先生
What's shakin', Twain?


791
01:21:10.710 --> 01:21:14.360
我好的不能再好了 很高兴见到你 朋友
Hey, I'm good on anything.Just like gravy, baby.Good to see you, my man.


792
01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.980
我也是 兄弟  对了  我最近看了你的著作《王子与贫儿》
You too, man.Hey! I finally read Prince and the Pauper.


793
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:18.650
是吗 怎么样？
Oh, is that right?


794
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:20.180
没看懂
Didn't get it.


795
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:22.560
真的假的？
For reals?


796
01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:26.800
我说的反话！嘣! 骗到你了！！
Satire! Boom! I got ya!


797
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:29.220
-我只是和你开玩笑而已- I'm just pulling your leg.
- 我去-Oh, man.


798
01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.880
我的名字叫Don...Don Don Diego
Um... I am Don...Don Don Diego.


799
01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:52.520
好吧 Don 我的名字叫Wyatt...Wyatt Wyatt Earp
Well, Don, I'm Wyatt...Wyatt Wyatt Earp.


800
01:21:55.820 --> 01:22:00.540
搞定 现在我们开始打牌吧~~~~
Got him. Now let's play some cards!


801
01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:30.450
在这个叫Wyatt Earp的人毁掉我们计划之前 我们要赶紧想办法进去
 Let's get inside before this Wyatt Earp ruins our plan.


802
01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:32.960
Tommy 但是门口人太多了 你怎么进去啊？
But there's no way for you to sneak past them guys, Tommy.


803
01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.580
这里没有岩石 没有树木 没有可以做掩护的东西啊
There's no rocks, no trees, no nothing to hide behind.


804
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:40.510
当你和风是朋友的时候 你就不需要掩护
No need to hide, brother, when you are friends with the wind.


805
01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:43.630
我给你说 在那边 Mexico不是墨西哥的发音
 I'm telling you, down there,they don't call it "Mexico."


806
01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:46.430
他们读成Mehico X发成H的音
It's "Mehico." The "X" is an "H."


807
01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:48.520
那是不是德克萨斯州的读音应该是"Tehas."
'm presuming Texas is "Tehas."


808
01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:51.880
就是一个风滚草 有什么大惊小怪的
 Just a tumbleweed. you jumpy bastard.


809
01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.040
我去 这是什么？
what's this?


810
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.980
我擦 还真特么神了
That is some mystical shit.


811
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.420
我想把卧室的梳妆台搬到窗口附近 但是我一个小女子没有力气做...
I wish to move the dresser in my bedroom closer to the window,but I haven't the strength to do it myself.


812
01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:29.420
夫人 我真的想帮你忙 但是我必须呆在这弹钢琴
I'd love to help, ma'am, but I really should keep playing the piano.


813
01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.920
没人会知道你离开
No one will even know you're gone.


814
01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.830
先生们 快点下注吧
Gentlemen, cough up your buy-ins.


815
01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:44.040
赶紧的 多下多得
Make it rain like Twain.


816
01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:48.890
老东家 你这个酒真不赖啊 从哪里弄来的？
Sure is some good hooch there, Zeke. Where'd you find that?


817
01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:52.540
噢 那瓶酒 早在20多年前我就得到了
Oh, I got that from a case about, uh, 20 years ago.


818
01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:56.980
实际上 你们都知道Jawbone瀑布下面有个小木屋吧？
In fact, uh, you know that shack up by Jawbone Falls?


819
01:23:57.850 --> 01:23:59.600
当时里面住了一个女的
There was a lady living there.


820
01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:02.280
她是Frank Stockburn的众多情人之一
It was one of Frank Stockburn's many paramours.


821
01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:07.030
但是这个女的是我这辈子见过最丑的女子
Now this was one of the ugliest ladies I've ever seen in my life.


822
01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.060
听起来像一坨屎一样
Sounds like a real bucket of turds.


823
01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.870
但是她确实是一名很优秀的酿酒师
But she was a very talented distiller of alcohol.


824
01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:19.220
当她在给我马车装东西的时候 她的小儿子出来了
While she...While she's loading up my coach, her young boy comes out,


825
01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:24.360
摇摇晃晃的呆子 不会说话 像猪一样恶心
this big shambling oaf, mute, filthy as a hog,


826
01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:31.160
然后他居然开始跳起了 踢踏舞 还一边唱起了美国国歌
and he starts doing this horrible little tap dance whilst singing "The Star-Spangled Banner."


827
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:34.780
与其说是唱 不如说是低声咕噜着 像是一个原始人
Well, not singing it, really, but grunting it, like a caveman!


828
01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.500
这个野孩子祈求我给点他点钱 我就在口袋里找了几个硬币
You know, he wants me to throw him some pennies,so I fished a coin out of my pocket


829
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:49.300
然后我就扔给了他 估计是我用力气大了点 硬币击中了他的嘴 居然把他的门牙打掉了！
and I guess I don't know my own strength.I tossed it, hit him in the mouth, and knocked his tooth out!


830
01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.470
你丫够狠的啊！
What an asshole!


831
01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:00.460
别说这些了 我还在地窖里留着一瓶这样的好酒
In any event, I still have one bottle left from that case.


832
01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:04.940
等我把酒取来 来敬一敬那个可怕的女人和她丑陋的儿子！
I'll go fetch it and we can drink a toast to that awful woman and her hideous son.


833
01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:09.650
我擦 如此只丑陋的女人 你根本不会想和这种女人上床
Oh, she was ugly! You wouldn't even sleep with her.


834
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.050
我说...Don Don Diego先生 你的筹码在哪里？
Say, Don Don Diego...where's your buy-in?


835
01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.300
不是一个人一万5千美元吗？
I thought it was 15 grand a man.


836
01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.230
是你！
It's you!


837
01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:00.340
怎么回事？
What?


838
01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:02.140
什么怎么回事？
What "what"?


839
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:04.810
你到底在惊讶什么？
What are you so surprised about?


840
01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:10.030
我们在这里如此享受如此多乐趣 我感到很惊讶
Just so surprised at all the... the fun that we're having here,


841
01:26:10.050 --> 01:26:12.320
有牌打 有钱使 还有好酒喝...
with the card and the money and the booze and...


842
01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:19.830
其实我早上独自在家 擦古龙香水的时候 也是这幅表情
You know, I make that same face when I put my cologne on in the morning,especially when I'm home alone.


843
01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:21.150
你们猜我是怎么想的？
You know what I think?


844
01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.970
我觉得这位Don Don Diego先生根本就不是咖啡豆农场主
I think Don Don Diego isn't really a coffee bean rancher at all.


845
01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:28.880
他来这里的真正目的是抢我们的钱！
And his true purpose here is to rob us.


846
01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:33.470
不要逼我杀了你 Earp先生
Don't make me kill you, Mr. Earp.


847
01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:34.530
把手举起来
Hands up high.


848
01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:38.530
我擦 你敢对Wyatt Earp动手？
Oh, snap! You got the drop on Wyatt Earp?


849
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:41.500
他是我的兄弟  也是个狠角色哦
It's mi hermano.He's one bad hombre.


850
01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:50.210
恕我冒犯 我们必须得把你们绑起来 顺便借借你们的马
No disrespect, fellas.We're gonna have to tie you up, and we'll have to borrow your horses.


851
01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.960
喔~~我错过了什么好戏~~
Ooh, what'd I miss?


852
01:27:21.150 --> 01:27:23.300
Burro 快点跑起来！！
 Hurry up, Burro! Move your ass!


853
01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:40.710
对头 我们来对地方了 这就是红猪岩石
Yeah, I think we found it.That is one sweet hog right there.


854
01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:44.500
真是一只白白胖胖的肥猪猪
That is a sweet, majestic hog.


855
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.840
恩 就是 真是白胖白胖的
Yeah, that's a sweet one for sure.


856
01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:48.850
看起来还好啦
It's all right.


857
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:54.170
宝宝有点困惑了 我哪里都没有看到猪猪呀
I'm confused. I don't see a hog or a pig anywhere.


858
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:58.040
伦家只看见了一个像小鸡吧的东东~
All I see is the big old rock that looks like a weenie pee-pee.


859
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:05.310
也可以 你们也可以叫小鸡鸡 小猪儿虫子
Oh, you guys call a pee-pee a "hog."


860
01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:08.290
这个名字太诡异了...但是我喜欢...
That's weird. I like it, though.


861
01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:11.070
问题是 我没有看见会唱歌的风车啊
Problem is, I don't see no singing windmill anywhere.


862
01:28:11.230 --> 01:28:14.050
等一下...我听见了
Wait...I hear it.


863
01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.190
对 声音就是从那边传过来的
Yeah, it's coming from over there.


864
01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:22.030
啊 粑粑 我们来了 我们来了！！粑粑！！！
Ah! Daddy! Daddy!


865
01:28:25.090 --> 01:28:28.400
我们得救了！ 我们得救了！！
We're saved! We're saved!


866
01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.300
妈蛋 是我们的死对头
Oh, it's just these assholes.


867
01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:35.480
你们这群傻逼怎么了
What the hell happened to you guys?


868
01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:41.730
我们在抢夺了你们的钱后 逃到了Frisco
We was headed west to Frisco after we absconded with your loot.


869
01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:50.340
但是我们遇到了一些真正的坏人 Cicero和他的帮派
But we ran into these real bad characters.It was Cicero something and his crazy-ass gang.


870
01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:53.940
Cicero来过这里？ 然后他离开了？
Cicero was here? Then he left?


871
01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:57.940
他把我们埋在土里 让我们自生自灭
He left us in the dirt for fun.


872
01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:03.460
谁在敲我的头？快点滚开！！
Who does that?Sicko!


873
01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:08.410
如果会唱歌的风车在这里的话 那么为什么他们一帮人会离开？
If this is where the singing windmill is,then why would they just up and leave?


874
01:29:08.690 --> 01:29:11.680
或许那个教我们打球的人乱说的
Maybe that Stickie McSchnickens guy was just pulling our leg.


875
01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:14.580
2个小时之前 他们往北方走了
They went north... about two hours ago.


876
01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.510
差点忘了 Tommy可以追踪他们
Oh, yeah! Tommy can track 'em.


877
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:18.530
我们出发吧 不要在这里耗时间
Let's saddle up. We're burning daylight.


878
01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.550
等等！！
 Wait!


879
01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:22.200
你们不能把我们留在这里 把我们弄出去！！
You can't just leave us here, you gotta get us out!


880
01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:23.740
你们没有必要... 嘿嘿 赶紧走开
You don't need to... Hey, hey, hey!


881
01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.990
你们的钱还在我们这人 藏在我的裤子里 我们把它还给你
We still got the money!Yeah, I hid it in my pants.We'll give it back to ya!


882
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:29.510
我们的钱已经够了 我们走！
We don't need no more. Let's go!


883
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:36.520
嘿 先别走 能不能把我胡子里面的蚂蚁赶走？
Hey! Can you at least help me pick these ants out of my beard before you head out?


884
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:38.220
求求你们了?
Please?


885
01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:40.770
这样吧 如果你们答应一个条件 我们就把你们挖出来
Tell you what, we'll dig you up on one condition.


886
01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:43.250
说吧 快说 我们肯定答应！
 You say it, we'll do it!


887
01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:49.000
你们以后不能做犯法的事情 重新做人 多多行善
That you give up your lives of crime and take this second chance to start doing good by people.


888
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:50.620
我特么情愿去死
I'd rather die!


889
01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:52.460
门儿都没有！
No way!


890
01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:56.260
我们刚才在开玩笑 开玩笑的！
That was a joke! That was a joke!


891
01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:58.610
爸爸 我以后会变成好孩子的!
I'll be a good boy! I'll be a good boy, Daddy!


892
01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.560
现在往哪个方向走？东边还是西边？
Now what? East or west?


893
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:27.060
今天晚些时候 有大量的人和动物经过这里
Late in the day.Lot of traffic been going through here.


894
01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.720
我们要赶上还得花点时间
It's going to take a minute.


895
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:31.140
太好了 我们离粑粑越来越近了
Well, we must be getting mighty close.


896
01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.360
他们对好我们父亲好点 不然要拿话来说
They'd better be treating Dad well, or they're gonna have to answer to us.


897
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:38.530
看呐 这就是我们的父亲
There he is.There's the man himself.


898
01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.510
看呐 多么帅气的一张脸庞
 Look at that handsome hombre.


899
01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:42.720
这就是我们长这么帅气的原因
That's where we get our good looks.


900
01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:44.880
让我看看我们的老豆
Let me see ol' Pop.


901
01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.330
Tommy 我们父亲现在也是不是这幅长相？
Does he still
look like that, Tommy?


902
01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:01.950
Tommy?

903
01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:03.860
恩 长相没变
Yeah, he does.


904
01:31:05.150 --> 01:31:08.020
我们今晚在这里扎营吧 就在那边
Let's set up camp tonight.
Right out there.


905
01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:09.480
但是现在我们时间很宝贵啊
But we can't waste any time.


906
01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:12.850
Chico...你让我好好想想吧 我需要时间思考
Chico... I can't figure it out right now.


907
01:31:12.850 --> 01:31:16.430
我必须...等到日出之后...让我再想想
I gotta...Just give me till sunrise. Let me think.


908
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:48.210
亲爱的兄弟 当你们读到这封信的时候 我已经赶到父亲身边了
Dear brothers,by the time you read this, I will have caught up with Dad.


909
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:52.080
我知道我这样独自离去 你们肯定很难过
And I'm sure you're sore at me for sneaking out on you.


910
01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:04.020
但是这个叫Cicero的人 不仅抓了我们父亲 而且还害死我的母亲 我会让他血债血偿
But this fellow, Cicero, who took Pa, also took my mother's life,and I mean to make him pay for that.


911
01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:09.600
事情可能会一发不可收拾 我可以忍受我们做过的坏事
Things might get messy. I can live with all the bad stuff we've done,


912
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:15.030
我们一起劫持人质 一起盗窃 甚至意外杀了人
the hold-ups, the burglaries,the accidental decapitation,


913
01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:20.010
但是我唯一不能忍受的就是你们之中任何一个出事
but I couldn't live with myself if something happened to one of you.


914
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.780
所以你们就好好地呆在这里 等我把父亲尽快地带回来
So stay put and I'll be back with Dad as soon as I can.{


915
01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:31.020
如果我一直不会来的话 记住我会永远全心全意地爱你们
And if I don't come back,know that I love you boys with all my heart.


916
01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:33.940
你们的兄弟 Tommy
Your brother, Tommy.


917
01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:07.020
当时在银色峡谷 遇到你母亲 是我这辈子最幸运的事
Down at Silver Canyon...Meeting Betty Dunson...was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me.


918
01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:10.960
遇到母亲是他一生赢得的最大比赛
Mom was his biggest score.


919
01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:25.190
终于到了 我们千辛万苦来到这里 希望不会空手而归
Here we are.We'd better not have come all this way for nothing.


920
01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:26.660
Frank 交出那笔钱
I want the money, Frank.


921
01:33:26.690 --> 01:33:28.220
我知道你想要什么
I know what you want.


922
01:33:29.150 --> 01:33:32.180
你想要的钱在这 数数
There's your money.Count it.


923
01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:33.700
Tommy!

924
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:35.400
看呐 谁来了
Oh, look who showed up.


925
01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:41.560
我不确定是否有人已经把你藏好的钱挖了出来 所以我又去弄了另外一笔钱 这样保险点
I didn't know if somebody dug up what you buried, Pa,so I wanted to make sure you were covered either way.


926
01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:43.380
儿子 谢谢你
Thank you, son.


927
01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.270
哟 还真是个好孩子
Well, ain't that a good boy.


928
01:33:45.570 --> 01:33:47.090
是我的好儿子
That's my boy.


929
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:52.660
真是谢谢你了 Frank 但是 我得走了
Well, it's been a pleasure, Frank.But, uh...we'll be on our way.


930
01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:57.650
别急着走 我们还有笔帐没算完
Not so fast.You and me got some unfinished business.


931
01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:59.940
不可能 我们已经算清了
No, our business is done.


932
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.760
父亲 你记得我给你说过母亲是怎么死的吗?
Pa... you remember how I told you Ma died?


933
01:34:03.850 --> 01:34:04.950
记得
Yeah.


934
01:34:05.190 --> 01:34:10.840
有一个狗杂种开枪打死了她... 凶手的手上有个纹身 
Well, the son of a bitch who shot her....had a tattoo on his hand...


935
01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:15.070
和Cicero一样的纹身
just like Cicero here


936
01:34:16.190 --> 01:34:20.070
什么意思 我的这个马蹄纹身？
What, you mean...my little horseshoe?


937
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:22.270
这个纹身总是能带给我好运
That's always brought me luck.


938
01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.390
特别是我每次开枪射击人的时候
Especially when I was shooting somebody.


939
01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.630
凶手 你的运气已经用光了
Well, killer, your luck just ran out.


940
01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:34.880
如果你的手敢碰一下刀 你就会命丧黄泉
Your hand touch that knife, boy,it'll be the last thing you ever touch.


941
01:34:35.190 --> 01:34:37.240
放心 我不会用这些刀的
Oh, I ain't using these knives.


942
01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:41.330
不会 为了我的母亲
No.Not for my mama.


943
01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:46.510
我特地给你准备了一把特别的刀
I saved a special one just for you.


944
01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:03.030
你死期到了 白人的叛徒
Now you die, Injun-lover.


945
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:08.050
你敢动他一根汗毛试试？
He dies, you die.


946
01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:14.900
我们有14个人 你们才6个人 寡不敌众
Fourteen of us, six of you. Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?


947
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:17.210
现在我们有12个人了
Make that twelve of us.


948
01:35:21.670 --> 01:35:23.180
你他妈给我滚出来！！
Twelve of us!


949
01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:29.800
为什么要逼我干这些事情
I ain't sign up for this shit.


950
01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:03.820
你看到什么东西了吗？
You seeing this?


951
01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.350
-完全不起作用 -你在干什么？
- It's not working.- What are you doing?


952
01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:09.650
-看起来一点都不像风滚草 -快点回来
-Don't look like a tumbleweed at all, Herm. -Herm, come back! Come back, Herm.


953
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:12.820
好了 好了 现在每个人都冷静下来 听我说
All right, all right. Now, everybody just calm down.


954
01:36:13.130 --> 01:36:17.330
这个男的杀了他的母亲 罪有应得
A man's entitled... to kill his mother's killer.


955
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:23.090
另外 你们分钱的时候 不刚好少分一个人的钱吗?
Plus... that's one less guy you've got to split the money with!


956
01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.940
好主意 我们走！
Good thinking, Frank.Let's ride!


957
01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:34.700
干得好 我的儿子 真为你感到骄傲
Good job, son. I'm really proud of you.


958
01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:39.170
还一路找了这么多朋友 来帮你的忙 真聪明
And getting your friends to come all the way out here with you, brilliant.


959
01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:45.340
其实...他们不仅仅是我的朋友...实际上是我的兄弟
Well, sir... they ain't just my friends, they, uh...They're my brothers.


960
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:53.560
5个？
Five?


961
01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:55.620
是的 你还有5个孩子
 You had fun, didn't you, sir?


962
01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:01.260
好吧 那我过去给他们打声招呼吧
Well, I'm gonna introduce myself.


963
01:37:01.330 --> 01:37:02.740
我想他们会很高兴的
I think they'd like that.


964
01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:12.210
我叫Frank Stockburn 是你们的父亲

966
01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:19.790

- Son.

967
01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:22.820
这是我的小毛驴
This is my burro.


968
01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:25.620
见到你很荣幸 burro
Proud to know you, Burro.


969
01:37:27.150 --> 01:37:28.480
他很荣幸
He's proud.


970
01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:32.380
你一定是Saint Louis 对吧？
You must be, uh, Saint Louis, right?


971
01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:33.680
Chico.

972
01:37:33.970 --> 01:37:36.880
好小子 你遗传了你母亲的好身板儿
Boy, you got your mom's muscles.


973
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:39.520
你是职业拳击手？
You a prizefighter?


974
01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:43.850
恩...其实...我是一名钢琴家
No, actually, I'm a... piano player.


975
01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:49.250
其实 我没事儿也喜欢弹弹钢琴
Oh, well, I'll be!You know, I've been known to tickle the ivories myself.


976
01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:53.900
挺有意思的 我们应该以后一起弹奏个什么曲子
Now and then, you know.We should play together sometime.


977
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:57.380
很乐意 父亲
I'd like that, Dad.


978
01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:58.830
非常乐意 
I'd like that a lot.


979
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:01.750
没问题 肯定有机会的
Yeah, son, we'll do that.


980
01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:14.360
你一定是Delilah的儿子
You must be Delilah's boy.


981
01:38:16.450 --> 01:38:20.020
儿子 你母亲酿得一手好的威士忌
Boy, she made some fine, fine whiskey.


982
01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:27.130
怀你的时候 你母亲肯定喝了不少酒吧
She must've been really hitting it hard when she was pregnant with you.


983
01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.700
你是...?
And, uh... you are?


984
01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.640
我叫小皮特 我是你的儿子 我灰常爱你! 粑粑!!
I'm Lil Pete. I'm your son! I love you so much, Dad!


985
01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:49.230
我有3颗奶头
I have three nipples.


986
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:51.700
多多益善嘛
 Yeah, well...It's always good to have a spare.


987
01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:55.020
我天 你居然也有3个奶奶？！
Gall dang, you have one, too?


988
01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:57.670
你喜欢玩多余的这个奶奶头吗？
Do you like to play with the extra one?


989
01:38:57.670 --> 01:38:59.210
超级稀饭
Oh, you betcha.


990
01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:02.220
粑粑 我想问你一个问题
Oh, Pa, I have a question for you.


991
01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:06.270
宝宝都是怎么生出来的呢？
Where do babies come from?


992
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:10.110
妈妈拉屎屎的时候 宝宝就一起生出来了
Well, son, the mom just poops 'em out.


993
01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:14.080
哈哈哈哈 我就知道 我就知道是这样！！
 I knewed it! I knewed it, Dad!


994
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:17.300
瞧这个帅小伙儿
Well, look at this handsome devil.


995
01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:22.140
我叫丹尼 终于能见到你了！
Sir, I'm Danny.It's awful nice to finally meet ya.


996
01:39:22.150 --> 01:39:24.750
你能帮助我解决一个问题吗？
Could you help me with a problem?


997
01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:26.780
我做了一件很蠢的事情
I did a real stupid thing


998
01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:32.030
这件事情意外导致了美国总统的离世
that inadvertently led to the death of a United States President,


999
01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:35.260
我一直都被这件事所困扰
and I'm feeling pretty lousy about it.


1000
01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:41.050
孩子 看着我的眼镜
Well, son...look in my eyes.


1001
01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:45.210
不好的事情时常发生
Shit happens.


1002
01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:50.250
说的倒是
Yeah, right.


1003
01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:53.100
非常感谢您的建议
Thanks. Thank you, sir.


1004
01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.360
不客气
You're welcome.


1005
01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.540
现在你们有什么打算?
So, where to now, huh?


1006
01:39:57.540 --> 01:40:01.710
再过几天 我就要和小狐狸结婚了
Well, sir, Smoking Fox and me are getting married in a few days,


1007
01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.000
我的养父会陪新娘走过红地毯
and Screaming Eagle's walking her down the aisle,


1008
01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:10.340
我希望...到时候你会站在我身边
and I was hoping...you could be there, next to me.


1009
01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:13.220
你意思是让我当你伴郎？
Oh, you mean your best man?


1010
01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:14.680
是的 父亲
Yes, sir.


1011
01:40:15.190 --> 01:40:16.410
Oh, Tommy...

1012
01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:19.290
你邀请我 我非常荣幸
You know, that's...that's quite an honor.


1013
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:21.240
应该是我很荣幸
It would be my honor, sir.


1014
01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:31.570
但是...儿子...我得...去北边处理一些事情...
yeah. Well, uh...But unfortunately, I...I got some business up north that I gotta attend to.


1015
01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:38.260
我还得去还一些赌债...还得去给医生结账...
I gotta collect some gambling debts and...You know, just to pay the doctors and such.


1016
01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:41.560
父亲 其实你根本不用担心钱的问题
Say, Dad. You don't ever gotta worry about money ever again.


1017
01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.500
我们一共攒齐了2个5万美元！！！
We had to conjure up 50 grand twice!


1018
01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:46.860
当时我们一共有10万美元！！
So we ended up with 100!


1019
01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:48.950
10万？
A hundred?


1020
01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.140
你们手里还有5万美元？
There's another 50 grand?


1021
01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:52.190
Yes, sir.

1022
01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.190
就在这里 小毛驴背上背着
Right here, in the burro's saddlebag.


1023
01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:01.370
所以 北边的事情可以再缓缓 对吧 伴郎先生？
So that business can wait up north, can't it... best man?


1024
01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:07.360
既然你们这么执着 我确实要改变一下我的计划了
Well, now that you mention it, maybe I should change my plans.


1025
01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:17.710
什么情况 为什么那群人回来了？！
Hey! What are they doing back?


1026
01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:25.350
到底什么回事？
What is this?


1027
01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:32.830
我想是时候告诉你们真相了
I guess it's time you kids learned the truth about your dear old dad, huh?


1028
01:41:34.190 --> 01:41:36.770
我太臭名昭著了
I'm just too famous.


1029
01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:43.420
我一来到西部这些地方 就会被到处通缉
I can't walk into any town west of the Rockies without someone calling the law.


1030
01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:50.040
所以我想了一个妙计 一个我不需要动手 就有人帮我弄钱的好办法
So, I came up with a way we could make 50 grand without lifting a finger.


1031
01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:54.030
你们这群孩子居然给我弄到了双份的钱！
And you rascals brought us double!


1032
01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:56.400
不愧是我的亲生儿子！
Are these my kids or what?


1033
01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.970
真是他妈瞎了眼了
Son of a bitch!


1034
01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:06.770
如果我们2个帮派合伙 那么我们以后在西部就无敌了
If our two gangs joined forces,there's not a lawman in the West that would stand up against us.


1035
01:42:06.970 --> 01:42:09.780
凭什么你觉得我们会加入你？
What makes you think we'd turn to a life of crime?


1036
01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.820
因为你们天生就是干这个的
'Cause it's in your blood.


1037
01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:13.820
老实回答我
Answer me something.


1038
01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:19.370
除了偷窃 你们还做过其他什么伟大的事情没有？
Were you ever great at anything in your life besides stealing?


1039
01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:22.860
No. No.

1040
01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:26.390
你们的本性就是这样的
You apples didn't fall far from this tree.


1041
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:29.090
不要否认这一点
Don't deny who you are.


1042
01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:34.550
如果你真的清楚我们本性的话 你就应该感到害怕了
If you knew who we really were, you'd be very scared right now.


1043
01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:39.760
孩子不要高估了你自己
Don't overplay your hand, son.


1044
01:42:41.370 --> 01:42:43.960
我还有一张王牌在手里
I'm still holding an ace.


1045
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:56.730
我找到她了 告诉过你...我会找到她的...
I found her. I...I told you I'd find her.


1046
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:05.520
这个小妞儿前几天闯到我们的营地里了
This little beauty stumbled into our camp a few days ago.


1047
01:43:08.110 --> 01:43:10.970
事实上她还是来救我的
she actually tried to rescue me.


1048
01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:15.730
现在你估计不想让我当你伴郎了吧 ？
I'm guessing this means you don't want me to be your best man no more, huh?


1049
01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:21.030
长话短说 我们速战速决
Well, I'm gonna make this real simple for you.


1050
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:28.540
要么你把那个蠢货袋子里的5万块钱给我
Hand over the other 50 grand...in that stupid ass' saddlebag,


1051
01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:33.850
要么我就让你的未婚妻脑袋吃颗子弹
or I put a bullet in her pretty Apache head.


1052
01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:38.700
你做梦吧
That ain't gonna happen.


1053
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.660
噢 不同意是吧？
Oh, it ain't?


1054
01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:41.810
No, sir.

1055
01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:44.060
为什么？
Why's that?


1056
01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:47.220
恩...还真是个秘密
Mmm... kind of a secret.


1057
01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.510
告诉你的父亲吧 小子
Well, you can tell your old man, can't ya?


1058
01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.270
你们手下刚才拿走的...那袋钱
You know that bag...your boy's holding?


1059
01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.370
本来是给Cicero的
It was meant for Cicero.


1060
01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:04.500
里面装了很特别的东西
So there's something special in there.


1061
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:05.530
B计划
Plan B.


1062
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:06.430
B计划？
Plan B?


1063
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:08.000
B计划
Plan B.


1064
01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:10.120
把包给我
Give me that bag.


1065
01:44:17.820 --> 01:44:19.060
完蛋了
Oh, shit!


1066
01:44:34.110 --> 01:44:35.010
你在哪里？
Where is she?


1067
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:47.540
小狐狸
Smoking Fox.


1068
01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.120
再见了 儿子
Nighty-night, son.


1069
01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:11.460
Danny你没事吧？
Danny, are you all right?


1070
01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:17.470
Danie 做得好 你救了我的命
You done good, Daniel. You saved me.


1071
01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:21.420
总统先生 这是我的职责
It's my duty, Mr. President.


1072
01:45:25.130 --> 01:45:26.650
林肯夫人你好
Mrs. Lincoln.


1073
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:58.490
我打死了一个！！
I got one!


1074
01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:00.310
傻逼 你特么差点打死我！
Clem, you almost shot me!


1075
01:46:09.210 --> 01:46:11.660
这张钞票还能用吗？ 还是烧烂了？
Is this here still valid,or is it too burnt up?


1076
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:16.660
让我看一下 我觉得看起来还可以用 
Let me take a look here.Uh, that looks good to me. I mean, this looks good.


1077
01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:20.220
我操 ！！ 你根本就没有把右眼挖出来！！！
What in the hell?You didn't scoop yours out, did you?


1078
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:24.790
你问的什么问题？
What was the question again?


1079
01:46:25.370 --> 01:46:28.920
什么？？你们是不是都没人把眼睛挖出来?
What?Did any of you really do it?


1080
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:36.590
那罐子里到底装的谁的眼睛？？？！！！！
Well, then whose eyes are in that jar?


1081
01:46:38.010 --> 01:46:41.400
小脸孩子怪找到了一些小石头 涂了涂颜料...
Well, Babyface found some rocks, and, uh, painted them.


1082
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:43.280
好看吧？...
Surprise?


1083
01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:59.510
嘿 Tom 想玩个游戏吗？
Hey, Tom,you wanna play a game?


1084
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:03.470
来弥补我们以前失去的父子时光？
to make up for all the father-son time we missed?


1085
01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:06.390
来捉迷藏吧
Peek-a-boo.


1086
01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.560
嘿 快来这边
Hey, come over here!


1087
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:16.980
不 来那边！
 No, come over there!


1088
01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:24.640
你本来可以得到一切的 儿子
You could have had everything, son.


1089
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:27.870
但是你非得这么正直
But you had to do the right thing.


1090
01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:34.620
给你一点作为父亲的建议
Let me leave you with a bit of fatherly advice.


1091
01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:41.070
永远不要在枪战中用刀子
Never bring a knife to a gunfight.


1092
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:44.620
小狐狸 以后可能我会置你于危险之中
One day, there will be too many, my love.


1093
01:47:44.710 --> 01:47:46.740
但是我相信你今天不会

你母亲要去告发我们

我都不知道从何说起了

1114
01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:21.020
但是没关系 Tommy的印第安养父 答应做我们所有人的父亲
But it's okay, 'cause Screaming Eagle, the Indian chief who raised Tommy said he'd be all our dads, too.
