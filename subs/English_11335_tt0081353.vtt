Hooray, hooray, Sweethaven

We're people from the sea

10
00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:25.905
Safe from democracy

11
00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.703
Sweeter than a melon tree

12
00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:31.370
Put here for you and me

18
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.813
God must have landed here

19
00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.520
Why else
would he strand us here?


20
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.529
Where the air
is nice and clear


21
00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:25.827
Sweethaven
even sounds so near


22
00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:29.165
To Heaven

23
00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:39.077
God will always bless
Sweethaven


24

25
00:04:54.394 --> 00:05:01.994
God will always bless
Sweethaven.

There'll be 25 cents

29
00:05:26.293 --> 00:05:27.692
What for?

30
00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:29.490
Where's your seacraft?

31
00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.553
lt ain't no seacraft.

32
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.393
lt's me dinghy,
and it's under the wharf.


33
00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:33.490
Aha. Ah, huh.

34
00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:34.557

You're new in town, right?

37
00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:39.397
You call this a town?

38
00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.565
Yeah.

39
00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:41.767
Well, first of all,

40
00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.537
there's 1 7 cents

41
00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:46.239
Then there's 45 cents

42
00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.042

44
00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:51.574
So, all together,
you owe the Commodore


45
00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:52.879
$1 .87.

46
00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.079
Ah, who's this Commodore?

47
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.883
That the nature of a question?

48
00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.719
There's a nickel question tax.

49
00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:59.588
Oh, forget it.
l see what you're up to here.


50
00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:00.684
Here we go.

51

53
00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:06.623
Oh. Mmm. Here's a dollar.

54
00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:09.533
Here's a red cent.

55
00:06:09.603 --> 00:06:11.127
Here's a franc.

56
00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:12.399
A peso.

57
00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:13.770
Here's a guilder.

58
00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:15.399
Oh, sorry l'm taking

59
00:06:15.442 --> 00:06:16.966

60
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.137
There's a dime; there we go.

61
00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:20.771
There's one quarter.

62
00:06:20.814 --> 00:06:21.906
Curiosity tax.

63
00:06:21.948 --> 00:06:23.438
Hey, l paid me tax.

64
00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.515
Oh, tax this, tax that.

65
00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:33.150
Ooh, my nightmare don't...

66
00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:34.785
Mmm, l gets disgustipated.

67
00:06:34.828 --> 00:06:36.352
''Have you paid your tax?''

68
00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:40.062
l got it, l got it.

69
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.567
No, l-l got it.

70
00:06:41.668 --> 00:06:43.465
l got it, l got it.

71
00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:45.562
Don't worry, l got it.

72
00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:47.573
Holy cow.

73
00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:48.766
Looks like me old pipe.

74
00:06:48.808 --> 00:06:50.173
Wonder what it's doing here?

75
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.008
What a coinkydink.

76
00:06:57.817 --> 00:06:59.148
Hey! What is this?

77
00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:01.312
This ain't the orchestra pit.

78
00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:19.030
Oh, lookit there.

79
00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:20.505
Nobody seems to care...

80
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.371
You've got so much
to bear, ma'am.


81
00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:23.671
Can l...?

82
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.042
Blow me down!

83
00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.774
That's it, that... !

84
00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.374
Oh, it's the wind and air...

85
00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:34.285
Just try to double dare
to... blow me down.


86
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:35.879
Awk! Wait for me!

87
00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:37.549
Hello, there, mate.
Maybe, uh...


88
00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.849
Ah, blow me down.

89
00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:42.657
lt's no bother, but...

90
00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:44.163
Look over there--
stranger's coming.


91
00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:45.494
You'd rather not, huh?

92
00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:47.022
Well, that's easy to see.

93
00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:48.659
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm

94
00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:50.533
Wherever l go...

95
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.800
Ooh, nice-looking knees,

96
00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.898
it does it for me.

97
00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.238
Bad news!
Bad, bad, bad news.


98
00:07:56.276 --> 00:07:57.868
Hmm, l don't believe that.

99
00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:59.071
What a lovely day...

100
00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:00.977
Well, it's still
a perfect day, but...


101
00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:03.448
Oh, maybe ma'am,
you would like to...


102
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.178
Blow me down again, there.

103
00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:06.776
lt's a lovely place

104
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.448
Think l'd like to stay, but...

105
00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.888
Stranger in town.

106
00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:12.118
Blow me down.

107
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.887
Somebody roll into town?

108
00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:16.953
Trouble, trouble,
trouble, trouble...


109
00:08:16.997 --> 00:08:19.227
Blow me down--
local glum club.


110
00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.892
lt's friendly here...

111
00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:22.026
A little scary, too.

112
00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:23.501
l think l'll spend a year,

113
00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:24.867
Or two, maybe thr...

114
00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:26.804
Whoa, tut-tut-tut.

115
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.368
l yam what l yam,
wherever l go


116
00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:34.175
l came from the sea...

117
00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:35.875
Should've got me number,

118
00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:38.509
but no one's looking it up,
ain't it?


119
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.044
Oh...

120
00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:42.179
Good day. . . Good day.

121
00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:43.280
l hate you to pieces!

122
00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:45.848
Kind of a greasy good day,
but that's all right.


123
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.327
Bunch of carrotsk?

124
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.059
No, no.

125
00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.361
You ain't got no carrotsk?

126
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:55.561
What are those, prunes?

127
00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:56.933
Phooey on carrots!

128
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.835
Take broccoli.

129
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.999
l am in the mood for carrotsk.

130
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.440
l need me vitamins.

131
00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:03.874
Phooey on carrots!

132
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:04.934
Take spinach!

133
00:09:04.978 --> 00:09:07.503
lf l wants spinach,
l'll axk you for spinach.


134
00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:09.946
So, why you didn't say so?

135
00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:12.178
For you, each a dollar.

136
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.515
How much is the broccoli?

137
00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.520
Nickel, maybe dime.

138
00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:15.645
And the spinach?

139
00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:16.713
Dime, maybe quarter.

140
00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.246
Then how come
carrotsk is a dollar?


141
00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.280
Dollar fifty.

142
00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.020
You buy what l don't feel
like selling,


143
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.050
it'll cost you $2.

144
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.155
All right, here you go.

145
00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:26.722
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

146
00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:29.394
Hey, deadbeat, this is a nickel.

147
00:09:29.436 --> 00:09:32.064
l pays what l feels like paying.

148
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.303
You're not up to no good,
are you?


149
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.174
'Cause if you are, there's
a 50-cent up-to-no-good tax.


150
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.177
Come here! Come back!

151
00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:45.343
Seems like everywhere

152
00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:47.353
Lots of people here

153
00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:49.287
Try to blow me down...

154
00:09:50.557 --> 00:09:53.219
Unlike the clothes l wear

155
00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.419
l haven't...

156
00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:55.951
Careful, there.

157
00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:57.963
What blew him into town?

158
00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:59.965
Oh, the short arm of the law,
huh?


159
00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:04.459
Blow me down

160
00:10:04.504 --> 00:10:05.766
Blow me down...

161
00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:07.534
Ow!

162
00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:11.305
Hey, come ba... hey, hey-- ah!

163
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.248
Uh, are you the piano tuner

164
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.587
or the man
with the party favor?


165
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.320
You got a room for renk?

166
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.588
What for what?

167
00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:31.994
Renk, renk-- your sign says you
got a room for renk.


168
00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:34.397
Oh, my stars and gardens!

169
00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:36.402
My mind was
a million miles away.


170
00:10:36.436 --> 00:10:39.098
Come in before you catch
your death of mud.


171
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.572
''Mud.''

172
00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:44.877
''Oyls.'' That explains it.

173
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:46.401
She's down a quart.

174
00:10:46.446 --> 00:10:49.415
Scums-- l'll find you.

175
00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:52.247
Come on, come on!

176
00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:57.085
Mmm. Don't make them
like they used to.


177
00:10:58.554 --> 00:11:00.249
Oh, come on.

178
00:11:04.994 --> 00:11:06.985
Oh!

179
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:11.022
l'm sorry, Mother,
but it's ugly.


180
00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:14.002
l ask you, have you ever
seen anything so ugly?


181
00:11:14.036 --> 00:11:15.970
l won't be engaged
in this hat.


182
00:11:16.005 --> 00:11:17.302
l heard that.

183
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.932
Don't think
l didn't hear that.


184
00:11:18.975 --> 00:11:20.306
Oh...

185
00:11:20.343 --> 00:11:21.833
She owes me an apology.

186
00:11:21.878 --> 00:11:23.106
Oh... ugly.

187
00:11:23.146 --> 00:11:25.239
There's nothing left to say.

188
00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:26.612
What do you think?

189
00:11:26.716 --> 00:11:28.911
l think it's up to you, dear.

190
00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:31.715
Well, what do you think? Ugly.

191
00:11:31.754 --> 00:11:34.279
l think it's a conspiracy.

192
00:11:34.323 --> 00:11:35.620
Oh...

193
00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:38.455
Why would they manufacture
deliberate ugliness


194
00:11:38.494 --> 00:11:40.587
unless they wanted me
to look ugly?


195
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.394
lf we find that out,
we find out everything.


196
00:11:43.432 --> 00:11:45.900
There's a stranger
in t... um... ooh...


197
00:11:45.935 --> 00:11:47.027
Oh...

198
00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:48.229
l can't get engaged.

199
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:50.330
You'll have to tell
Bluto; l can't.


200
00:11:50.373 --> 00:11:52.136
We'll have to cancel the party

201
00:11:52.175 --> 00:11:53.267
tomorrow night.

202
00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:54.799
lt's not my fault
that it's so ugly.


203
00:11:55.878 --> 00:11:56.970
What are you doing

204
00:11:57.013 --> 00:11:58.571
listening in on
a private conversation


205
00:11:58.614 --> 00:11:59.740
between me and my mother?

206
00:11:59.782 --> 00:12:02.683
l have a good mind to have
my father call a policeman.


207
00:12:02.718 --> 00:12:05.152
Olive, will you show
Mister... Mister...?


208
00:12:05.188 --> 00:12:06.280
Oh. Popeye, ma'am.

209
00:12:06.322 --> 00:12:07.550
... Mr. Eye

210
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.716
the spare room?

211
00:12:08.758 --> 00:12:09.850
Just Popeye, ma'am.

212
00:12:09.892 --> 00:12:10.859
Go upstairs, Mr. Eye.

213
00:12:10.893 --> 00:12:12.053
Olive will show you the room.

214
00:12:12.094 --> 00:12:13.026
Thanks.

215
00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:15.529
Some kind of asylum here.

216
00:12:15.565 --> 00:12:16.589
Show me a room.

217
00:12:16.632 --> 00:12:17.826
Show me some courtesy

218
00:12:17.867 --> 00:12:18.834
might be nice.

219
00:12:18.868 --> 00:12:20.335
l don't see why
l have to do anything


220
00:12:20.369 --> 00:12:21.836
on the day
before my engagement party


221
00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:23.338
when nothing's ready,
especially me.


222
00:12:23.372 --> 00:12:25.602
And what kind of name is that,
anyway-- Popeye?


223
00:12:25.675 --> 00:12:26.835
Pretty strange.

224
00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:28.741
What kind of name is Olive Oyl?

225
00:12:28.778 --> 00:12:30.939
Sounds like
some kind of lubricants.


226
00:12:32.014 --> 00:12:33.345
Thank you very much, ma'am.

227
00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:36.442
Don't look in that room;
that's my room.


228
00:12:36.485 --> 00:12:37.952
Meant no disrespect there.

229
00:12:37.987 --> 00:12:39.318
Ugly, huh?

230
00:12:39.355 --> 00:12:41.152
You owe me an apology.

231
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.316
What?

232
00:12:42.358 --> 00:12:44.121
Wonder who shoved
a feather in his ear?


233
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.127
What'd you say?

234
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:47.186
Sure is nice weather
you have here.


235
00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:51.630
Your name really Olives?

236
00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:52.964
So what?

237
00:12:53.002 --> 00:12:53.969
Olives Oyl?

238
00:12:55.104 --> 00:12:56.833
You don't look Greek to me.

239
00:12:56.872 --> 00:12:58.032
So, you're short.

240
00:12:58.074 --> 00:13:00.167
Or are you just passing
yourself off as short?


241
00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:02.302
Can l see me room now?

242
00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:04.210
Ooh, as if l cared.

243
00:13:04.247 --> 00:13:06.044
Let me give you a hand there.

244
00:13:06.082 --> 00:13:07.049
Maybe it needs a little oil.

245
00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:08.072
Oh!

246
00:13:09.418 --> 00:13:10.680
Oh, oh...

247
00:13:15.057 --> 00:13:17.855
Nice-looking room.

248
00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:25.389
Never seen a room done
in early demolish-kin before,


249
00:13:25.434 --> 00:13:26.924
but this'll do for me.

250
00:13:26.969 --> 00:13:29.199
Careful how you treat
that bed.


251
00:13:29.238 --> 00:13:31.001
Nothing goes on this bed.

252
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.302
Sorry, ma'am, it's just some...

253
00:13:32.341 --> 00:13:34.309
Watch that lamp!

254
00:13:34.343 --> 00:13:36.311
Let me give you some assistance.

255
00:13:36.345 --> 00:13:37.710
Here, give me your hand.

256
00:13:37.747 --> 00:13:39.715
There, that's it.
Yeah, here we go.


257
00:13:39.749 --> 00:13:40.909
Oh, you're in first.

258
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.612
ls that... oh...
Boy, is it hot in here.


259
00:13:43.686 --> 00:13:45.085
l still respect you.

260
00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:46.110
Ooh!

261
00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:52.618
Me bad eye, didn't see that.

262
00:13:52.662 --> 00:13:53.651
Hmph!

263
00:13:58.367 --> 00:13:59.800
Thanks for your help.

264
00:13:59.835 --> 00:14:02.804
Uh, Miss Oyl, maybe...

265
00:14:12.214 --> 00:14:14.273
Don't forget to put
the cat out, dear.


266
00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:16.012
We don't have a cat.

267
00:14:16.052 --> 00:14:17.349
Eau de toilette.

268
00:14:17.386 --> 00:14:19.149
Yeah, eau de toilette.

269
00:14:20.222 --> 00:14:21.519
Yeah.

270
00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:23.683
How do you like that?

271
00:14:23.726 --> 00:14:25.523
Gold is up 20 cents,
two dollars an ounce.


272
00:14:25.561 --> 00:14:26.823
Out of my kitchen, Mr. Wimpy.

273
00:14:26.862 --> 00:14:28.090
l knew it, l knew it, see...

274
00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.427
You wait for the supper gong.

275
00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:31.057
l could've made
a fortune on Billings


276
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.466
if Bluto would've let me go
directly to the Commodore.


277
00:14:33.502 --> 00:14:35.493
He's so jealous of me,
that Bluto.


278
00:14:35.538 --> 00:14:37.233
Well, who wouldn't be?

279
00:14:37.273 --> 00:14:39.002
Me, l'm not jealous of Castor.

280
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:40.065
He's my son.

281
00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:41.872
Man jealous of his own son.

282
00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:43.401
You owe me an apology.

283
00:14:43.446 --> 00:14:44.606
l didn't mean you.

284
00:14:44.647 --> 00:14:47.343
Never lets me go
to the Commodore.


285
00:14:47.383 --> 00:14:49.851
Commodore is a paragon
of sagacity.


286
00:14:49.885 --> 00:14:52.251
lf ever l could
put in a good word...


287
00:14:52.288 --> 00:14:53.255
''Shut up'' is the word.

288
00:14:53.289 --> 00:14:54.779
''Pass'' is another word
that Wimpy...


289
00:14:54.824 --> 00:14:55.882
You don't pass.

290
00:14:55.925 --> 00:14:58.621
He should be killed to death.

291
00:14:58.728 --> 00:15:01.526
lt says here the Commodore's
taxing salt again.


292
00:15:01.564 --> 00:15:04.055
Don't look as good as l smell,
but too late now.


293
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.431
Got to go.

294
00:15:05.468 --> 00:15:10.098
Oh, Mr. Eye,
have you met-- uh, Pop?


295
00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:11.572
Mr. Wimpy, my son Castor,

296
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.574
Mr. Geezil, my husband Cole.

297
00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:15.735
We're all one big
happy family here.


298
00:15:15.778 --> 00:15:17.746
-Hmph!
-Although not really.


299
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.748
l mean, well, Mr. Geezil
and Mr. Wimpy are, um...


300
00:15:19.782 --> 00:15:21.079
Me, l'm family.

301
00:15:21.117 --> 00:15:23.176
Well, you're my husband.

302
00:15:23.219 --> 00:15:25.119
You owe me an apology.

303
00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:27.588
Well, l can't find anything.

304
00:15:27.623 --> 00:15:29.147
What are you
looking for, Olive?


305
00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:30.715
-A glass.
-Oh, uh, here's a glass.


306
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.387
That's a short, fat, ugly glass.

307
00:15:32.428 --> 00:15:33.918
l want a tall, pretty,
slender glass.


308
00:15:33.963 --> 00:15:34.930
They're all broken.

309
00:15:34.964 --> 00:15:36.090
l could've made a fortune

310
00:15:36.132 --> 00:15:37.258
-in fish futures...
-Fish?


311
00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:39.130
but l'd have to dip
into capital.


312
00:15:39.168 --> 00:15:41.136
Fish futures smell.

313
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.570
What kind of glass
do you want, Olive?


314
00:15:43.606 --> 00:15:44.595
A wine glass

315
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.438
or a brandy glass,
or a water glass?


316
00:15:47.476 --> 00:15:49.239
Oh, not a thing--
l don't want a thing.


317
00:15:49.278 --> 00:15:50.245
Real appetizing.

318
00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:51.246
l want a fork.

319
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.372
Right beside your plate.

320
00:15:52.415 --> 00:15:54.110
lf it was a knife,
it would cut you.


321
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.378
-And a knife.
-Will you sit down?


322
00:15:55.418 --> 00:15:57.113
Why don't l have a knife?
And a nice dress?


323
00:15:57.153 --> 00:15:58.677
You owe me an apology.

324
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.380
Passing fish, please.

325
00:16:02.425 --> 00:16:03.915
Fish, excellent idea, Miss Oyl.

326
00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:05.824
l would suggest before
matrimony, fish.


327
00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:07.920
Fish before matrimony.

328
00:16:07.963 --> 00:16:09.954
Ooh, that does look good, there.

329
00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:12.160
Wish l had a plate though.

330
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:15.932
...because four times
engaged is three times much.


331
00:16:15.971 --> 00:16:18.303
Oh, he can't talk me out
of anything; l'm not a child.


332
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.568
l'll say you're not a child.

333
00:16:19.608 --> 00:16:22.338
-Who says l'm not a child?
-You said you're not a child


334
00:16:22.378 --> 00:16:23.402
and l agreed with you,
that's who.


335
00:16:23.446 --> 00:16:24.470
Who asked you
to agree with me?


336
00:16:24.513 --> 00:16:26.003
Well, no one can stop me
from agreeing with you


337
00:16:26.048 --> 00:16:27.572
-if l want to.
-l can.


338
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.810
Quarreling at my table.

339
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:30.284
You both owe me an apology.

340
00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:31.786
Sorry, Pop.

341
00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:32.310
What?

342
00:16:32.354 --> 00:16:33.446
Please pass the shrimp,

343
00:16:33.489 --> 00:16:34.581
chicken and meatballs.

344
00:16:34.623 --> 00:16:36.989
Well, l don't know.

345
00:16:37.026 --> 00:16:39.995
Captain Bluto has
the patience of Job.


346
00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:41.018
Or is it job?

347
00:16:41.063 --> 00:16:43.793
Certainly got
a very good job, Job.


348
00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:46.324
And he needs
a lot of patience.


349
00:16:46.368 --> 00:16:48.461
Why, he runs this town
for the Commodore


350
00:16:48.504 --> 00:16:49.471
while he's away.

351
00:16:49.505 --> 00:16:50.938
And the Commodore's
always away.


352
00:16:50.973 --> 00:16:52.770
As a matter of fact,
l've never seen him.


353
00:16:52.808 --> 00:16:53.968
-Have you, Cole?
-What?


354
00:16:54.009 --> 00:16:56.273
l'd never let a girl
break my engagement.


355
00:16:56.312 --> 00:16:59.110
l'd break her nose before
she broke my engagement.


356
00:16:59.148 --> 00:17:02.174
And you better not try on me
what you pulled on Bluto,


357
00:17:02.218 --> 00:17:04.345
because l'm no pushover.

358
00:17:04.386 --> 00:17:06.217
You owe your sister
an apology.


359
00:17:06.255 --> 00:17:07.745
Will you stop fidgeting?

360
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.052
Finishing touch here.

361
00:17:09.091 --> 00:17:10.956
Oh, this knife won't cut.

362
00:17:10.993 --> 00:17:11.982
Here, take mine.

363
00:17:12.027 --> 00:17:12.994
Not since l was child

364
00:17:13.028 --> 00:17:14.757
have we had a sharp knife
in this house.


365
00:17:14.797 --> 00:17:16.287
You owe me an apology.

366
00:17:16.332 --> 00:17:17.765
You don't like our knives.

367
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.200
Bluto's rich, he can buy you
plenty of knives.


368
00:17:20.236 --> 00:17:22.704
Ooh, l hate this table,
it's ugly.


369
00:17:22.738 --> 00:17:24.137
l'm the only one
with nerve enough


370
00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:25.299
to tell the truth about it.

371
00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:27.366
Well, then, why don't you
let Bluto the pushover


372
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:28.376
buy you a new table?

373
00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:29.377
-Am l right, Pop?
-Right.


374
00:17:29.411 --> 00:17:30.378
l'm right, right?

375
00:17:30.412 --> 00:17:31.379
-You're right.
-Right.


376
00:17:31.413 --> 00:17:32.573
Nothing left?

377
00:17:32.681 --> 00:17:34.410
Oh... Bluto, Bluto, Bluto.

378
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.214
Everyone takes advantage
of my poor Bluto.


379
00:17:37.253 --> 00:17:39.380
Get a new... glass,
a new knife.


380
00:17:39.421 --> 00:17:41.321
Now they want a table.
Well, hmph!


381
00:17:41.357 --> 00:17:42.824
That's why l always
have to break off


382
00:17:42.858 --> 00:17:44.155
our engagement--
to stop you all


383
00:17:44.193 --> 00:17:45.683
from taking advantage
of the sweetest,


384
00:17:45.728 --> 00:17:47.457
most humble man
on the face of this Earth!


385
00:17:47.496 --> 00:17:48.463
Hmph.

386
00:17:48.497 --> 00:17:49.555
Mmm.

387
00:17:53.068 --> 00:17:54.092
You make me sick.

388
00:17:57.606 --> 00:18:00.541
Never good to be too full,
l guess.


389
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.434
lt's 9:00!

390
00:18:53.476 --> 00:18:55.376
Curfew!

391
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:58.437
Lights... out!

392
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.457
You can have a kiss now.

393
00:19:16.532 --> 00:19:17.965
Oh!

394
00:19:22.605 --> 00:19:24.129
Poppa.

395
00:19:24.173 --> 00:19:25.902
Pretty soon you and me

396
00:19:25.942 --> 00:19:28.570
are going to be together again,
huh?


397
00:19:28.678 --> 00:19:30.111
Yeah.

398
00:19:30.146 --> 00:19:33.411
30 years ain't that long.

399
00:19:33.449 --> 00:19:37.442
Besides, next Wednesday's

400
00:19:37.487 --> 00:19:39.148
Yeah? Yeah.

Everything is food to go

413

Everything is food

Everything is food to go now

427

Yeah, l ordered a hamburger.

433
00:22:14.644 --> 00:22:16.111
That's what l got,

434
00:22:16.145 --> 00:22:17.112
No, l beg to disagree.

435
00:22:17.146 --> 00:22:18.340
Rough House,

00:22:18.381 --> 00:22:19.348

-l'm buying.
-Hey, thanks.


438
00:22:20.616 --> 00:22:21.913
Who's paying?

00:22:21.951 --> 00:22:23.213
l'm buying, he's paying.

440
00:22:23.252 --> 00:22:24.742
A nickel hamburger tax?

441
00:22:24.787 --> 00:22:26.379
l'd refuse to pay
if l were you.


442
00:22:26.422 --> 00:22:27.753
A shocking abuse of power.

443
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.088
Rough House!

444
00:22:31.694 --> 00:22:35.152

450
00:23:05.928 --> 00:23:08.761
Everything is upside-down

00:23:10.833 --> 00:23:14.769
Everything is sunny-side up

452
00:23:14.804 --> 00:23:16.897
Did you pay for this

453
00:23:16.939 --> 00:23:18.907
ln American?

454
00:23:18.941 --> 00:23:21.967
They can't trick us

455
00:23:22.011 --> 00:23:25.947
Everything is food,
food, food


456
00:23:25.982 --> 00:23:29.383
Everything is food.

457
00:23:38.561 --> 00:23:40.859
Hey, hey, hey, Laverne!

Give us a smooch!

459
00:23:45.301 --> 00:23:48.293
l really need someone
to kind of talk to,


460
00:23:48.337 --> 00:23:50.635
'cause l thought everybody
in this town might be deef.


461
00:23:50.706 --> 00:23:51.638
Huh, what's that?

462
00:23:51.707 --> 00:23:52.639
Huh? Oh.

463
00:23:55.278 --> 00:23:57.246
You know, jusk why

464
00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.510
l'm looking for me pap.

465
00:23:59.548 --> 00:24:00.515
Yeah, oh...

466
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:02.278
l've searched
the seven seas for him,


467
00:24:02.318 --> 00:24:04.047
and l haven't found him yet.

468
00:24:04.086 --> 00:24:07.317
l was only two years old,
me own pap left me.


469
00:24:07.356 --> 00:24:09.051
l was just a mere infink.

470
00:24:09.091 --> 00:24:10.456
Me own pap...

471
00:24:10.493 --> 00:24:12.893
Pipe down, will ya?

472
00:24:12.928 --> 00:24:15.192
Me own pap ditches me.

473
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:16.357
l'm a very tolerant man,

474
00:24:16.399 --> 00:24:18.367
except when it comes
to holding a grudge.


475
00:24:18.401 --> 00:24:20.528
l never thought
l'd forgive me paps,


476
00:24:20.569 --> 00:24:22.059
but about seven years ago,

477
00:24:22.104 --> 00:24:24.698
l ships out on this boat,
The Gloomy Gus.


478
00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.471
That's a boat. Yeah.

479
00:24:28.511 --> 00:24:30.206
Just off the coast of Guam.

480
00:24:30.246 --> 00:24:31.838
lt breaks up on this typhoon,

481
00:24:31.881 --> 00:24:34.008
and l'm stuck on
this raft for 45 days


482
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.312
without food or waters.

483
00:24:35.351 --> 00:24:38.013
But after all
this time on this raft,


484
00:24:38.054 --> 00:24:40.113
this visiktation comes to me.

485
00:24:40.156 --> 00:24:44.957
Looks just like me mother,
rest her soul.


486
00:24:44.994 --> 00:24:49.124
And it says,
''Your pap is still alive.''


487
00:24:49.165 --> 00:24:50.097
Excuse me.

488
00:24:51.767 --> 00:24:54.634
So, when l was finally rescued,

489
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.195
l figured out that l got
to forgive me paps, you know?


490
00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:58.263
Uh, you see,

491
00:24:58.307 --> 00:25:00.832
l'm only afeared
that he might be dead,


492
00:25:00.876 --> 00:25:03.106
and never realize what a
fine figure of an orphink


493

Not a mandolin

623
00:33:00.953 --> 00:33:03.285
Oh, no

624
00:33:03.322 --> 00:33:05.313
He's an accordion

He's virile

629
00:33:25.077 --> 00:33:26.772
And he's strong

630
00:33:26.812 --> 00:33:28.507

00:33:35.354 --> 00:33:36.514
Bluto.

637
00:33:36.555 --> 00:33:37.783
Bluto.

638
00:33:37.823 --> 00:33:38.790
At your services, sir.

639
00:33:38.824 --> 00:33:40.587
There's a good picture
in the paper this week.


640
00:33:40.626 --> 00:33:41.593
A lovely present for you

Captain Bluto.


642
00:33:43.061 --> 00:33:44.790
l would have brought it,
but it was too late.


643
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:45.990
Anytime you want me to come by

644
00:33:46.031 --> 00:33:47.965
and stain up the boat,
Captain Bluto.


645
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.661

He's got money and respect

647
00:33:53.972 --> 00:33:55.303
That's true

648
00:33:55.340 --> 00:34:00.175
He's better than the rest

649
00:34:00.212 --> 00:34:01.907
That's true

650
00:34:01.947 --> 00:34:06.407
He may not be the best

651
00:34:07.719 --> 00:34:09.846
But he's large

652
00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:12.215
And he's mine...

653
00:34:12.257 --> 00:34:13.451
She can have him.

654
00:34:13.492 --> 00:34:14.618
Yeah.

655
00:34:14.693 --> 00:34:16.251
She loves me.

656
00:34:19.331 --> 00:34:21.299
Of course she does.

657
00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:23.130
She don't love me.

658
00:34:23.168 --> 00:34:24.294
Oh, no.

659
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.434
She'll marry me.

660
00:34:31.777 --> 00:34:34.473
Large

661
00:34:34.513 --> 00:34:35.480

00:34:35.514 --> 00:34:37.209
Large

663
00:34:37.249 --> 00:34:38.216
Large

664
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.343
Mine

665
00:34:40.385 --> 00:34:41.249
Mine

666
00:34:41.286 --> 00:34:42.844
Mine

667
00:34:42.888 --> 00:34:44.048
Mine...

668
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:46.023
She won't marry me.

669
00:34:47.092 --> 00:34:48.024
Oh.

670
00:34:52.731 --> 00:34:53.857
She will.

671
00:34:58.136 --> 00:35:00.001
She won't.

672
00:35:07.612 --> 00:35:12.879
lt may seem funny,
but it's not


673
00:35:12.918 --> 00:35:14.613
Oh, no

674
00:35:14.653 --> 00:35:17.178
l'm thankful

675
00:35:17.222 --> 00:35:19.247
For what l've got

676
00:35:19.291 --> 00:35:20.519
Me, too

677
00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:25.496
lt may not be a lot

678
00:35:26.898 --> 00:35:30.265
But he's large.

679
00:35:33.472 --> 00:35:34.439
She will.

680
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.198
Yes, yes.

681
00:35:40.278 --> 00:35:42.212
She...

682
00:35:46.218 --> 00:35:50.018
Faulty flower...
C-Captain Bluto.


683
00:35:55.127 --> 00:35:57.459
Mrs. Oyl, Olive's...

684
00:35:57.496 --> 00:35:59.464
Olive's what?

685
00:35:59.498 --> 00:36:00.988
Olive's...

686
00:36:02.334 --> 00:36:04.825
...getting ready.

687
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.838
Good.

688
00:36:06.872 --> 00:36:07.998
Now, where were we?

689
00:36:08.039 --> 00:36:11.338
Uh, she won't
marry you, she...


690
00:36:14.946 --> 00:36:16.880
She will!

691
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.781
Oh, my word!

692
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.252
Son-in-law.

693
00:36:26.792 --> 00:36:28.555
Oh, yeah, yeah.

694
00:36:28.593 --> 00:36:29.753
Ah! Ooh.

695
00:36:53.246 --> 00:36:56.773
Olive!

696
00:37:11.664 --> 00:37:13.825
Marvelous, marvelous.

697
00:37:13.866 --> 00:37:15.458
No place to go.

698
00:37:15.501 --> 00:37:17.492
Can't go to no party
without an invite.


699
00:37:17.537 --> 00:37:18.526
Whoo!

700
00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:21.800
-Ho, ho, ho, whoa.
-Whoo! Ooh.


701
00:37:21.841 --> 00:37:23.138
-Miss Oyl.
-Oh...


702
00:37:23.176 --> 00:37:24.370
You scared the wits out of me.

703
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.207
Yeah, l almost knocked 'em
out of you, too.


704
00:37:26.245 --> 00:37:27.837
-Sorry l did that to you.
-What right do you have


705
00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.643
to lurk here in the dark
in the middle of the night


706
00:37:29.749 --> 00:37:30.977
and scare the wits
out of a person?


707
00:37:31.017 --> 00:37:32.814
l wasn't.
l was just, uh, kind of, uh...


708
00:37:32.852 --> 00:37:33.819
Oh, oh.

709
00:37:33.853 --> 00:37:35.650
How's your party going,
Miss Oyl?


710
00:37:35.688 --> 00:37:37.519
-Oh, that's a dumb question.
-Yeah.


711
00:37:37.557 --> 00:37:39.821
Where do you think l'm headed
right this minute?


712
00:37:39.859 --> 00:37:41.224
Um... well, uh,

713
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.488
mmm, that way, l think.

714
00:37:42.528 --> 00:37:43.495
Out of town.

715
00:37:43.529 --> 00:37:45.087
-l am not headed out of town.
-Oh.


716
00:37:45.131 --> 00:37:47.292
Don't you see which
direction l'm facing?


717
00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:49.062
-You're going, now you're...
-Oh, ooh, whoa.


718
00:37:49.102 --> 00:37:50.126
-Now you're facing east.
-Oh.


719
00:37:50.169 --> 00:37:51.295
Maybe a little southwest.

720
00:37:51.337 --> 00:37:52.497
-Place your bets.
-Oh. Oh!


721
00:37:52.538 --> 00:37:54.665
You need some help with
your bags there, Miss Oyl?


722
00:37:54.707 --> 00:37:56.072
-Ooh, oh, no.
-l didn't touch ya.


723
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:57.167
l didn't mean to hurt ya.

724
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.370
Thank you.

725
00:37:58.411 --> 00:37:59.844
-Oh, you do.
-Oh.


726
00:38:03.483 --> 00:38:04.609
Oh.

727
00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:07.620
No, that's the wrong way.

728
00:38:07.654 --> 00:38:08.643
Oh.

729
00:38:09.822 --> 00:38:11.619
No, that's the wrong way.

730
00:38:11.658 --> 00:38:13.125
l want to go...

731
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.889
Oh...

732
00:38:15.928 --> 00:38:17.361
Oh, oh...

733
00:38:17.397 --> 00:38:19.297
Whoo! Oh. Oh, oh.

734
00:38:19.332 --> 00:38:20.492
Oh!

735
00:38:20.533 --> 00:38:21.625
Oh, oh...

736
00:38:21.668 --> 00:38:22.635
Oh...

737
00:38:22.735 --> 00:38:23.793
That way.

738
00:38:23.836 --> 00:38:24.803
That'll be 50 cents

739
00:38:24.837 --> 00:38:26.134
impersonating-a-traffic-cop tax.

740
00:38:26.172 --> 00:38:27.139
What?

741
00:38:27.173 --> 00:38:28.435
Oh.

742
00:38:28.474 --> 00:38:29.634
l'm sorry, Miss Oyl.

743
00:38:29.742 --> 00:38:31.937
Didn't recognize you
from the back.


744
00:38:31.978 --> 00:38:33.809
lt won't happen again.

745
00:38:33.846 --> 00:38:36.041
How come Miss Oyl
don't have to pay no taxes?


746
00:38:36.082 --> 00:38:38.414
That's ten cents question tax.

747
00:38:38.451 --> 00:38:41.545
But... l'll let you off
this time


748
00:38:41.587 --> 00:38:43.452
since you're with Miss Oyl.

749
00:38:43.489 --> 00:38:44.979
Good night, Miss Oyl.

750
00:38:45.024 --> 00:38:46.514
Well, how come being
with Miss Oyl


751
00:38:46.559 --> 00:38:48.823
means l don't have
to pay no...


752
00:38:48.861 --> 00:38:50.192
...taxes?

753
00:38:50.229 --> 00:38:53.858
Well, l don't know
what you're talking about.


754
00:38:57.303 --> 00:39:00.932
Here's a nice cup of tea
for you, Captain Bluto,


755
00:39:00.973 --> 00:39:02.304
while you're waiting.

756
00:39:07.647 --> 00:39:10.810
Where's Olive?

757
00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:12.215
Olive?

758
00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:13.479
You think everyone pays taxes

759
00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:15.214
but me and my family,
don't you? Mm-hmm.


760
00:39:15.254 --> 00:39:16.619
Well, you couldn't be
more wrong.


761
00:39:16.689 --> 00:39:18.179
lf l'm wrong, why
am l in the right?


762
00:39:18.224 --> 00:39:20.055
You think it's because
l'm engaged to Bluto


763
00:39:20.093 --> 00:39:21.822
and Bluto runs the town
for the Commodore


764
00:39:21.861 --> 00:39:22.953
so we get special favors.

765
00:39:22.995 --> 00:39:24.053
Well, it's a lie. Hmm.

766
00:39:24.097 --> 00:39:25.655
Olive!

767
00:39:31.838 --> 00:39:33.203
Bluto is kind and generous

768
00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:35.434
and likes to do things
for his loved ones.


769
00:39:36.676 --> 00:39:38.303
And you want me to
hurt his feelings.


770
00:39:38.344 --> 00:39:39.606
Well, phooey on you.

771
00:39:41.013 --> 00:39:43.777
Hmm. You don't even care
enough about me or my family


772
00:39:43.816 --> 00:39:45.340
to be at my engagement party.

773
00:39:45.384 --> 00:39:48.217
And what are you doing here
in Sweethaven anyway, hmm?


774
00:39:48.254 --> 00:39:50.154
Well, l'm-l'm looking
for me pap.


775
00:39:50.189 --> 00:39:51.281
-Mmm.
-Yeah.


776
00:39:51.324 --> 00:39:54.418
Oh, well, if that's true,
then where is he?


777
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.621
Well, yeah, um, got me there.

778
00:39:56.662 --> 00:39:58.152
l don't really know.

779
00:39:58.197 --> 00:39:59.824
l... l got this sense

780
00:39:59.866 --> 00:40:01.595
that he's here though,
you know?


781
00:40:01.634 --> 00:40:03.659
Oh, well, all right,
l'll wait. Hmm.


782
00:40:03.703 --> 00:40:06.171
Anyway, there are too
many guests as it is.


783
00:40:06.205 --> 00:40:07.331
Half of them l hate.

784
00:40:25.558 --> 00:40:27.185
One thing l remember
about me pap


785
00:40:27.226 --> 00:40:29.694
was that he always used
to throw me up in the air.


786
00:40:29.796 --> 00:40:32.424
But he'd never be there
when l come down, you know.


787
00:40:32.465 --> 00:40:33.693
-Heh, heh, heh.
-Mmm.


788
00:40:33.733 --> 00:40:35.633
Boy, he had a sense ka humor,
didn't he?


789
00:40:35.668 --> 00:40:36.862
Yeah, that was me pap.

790
00:40:36.903 --> 00:40:38.666
l remember that time
he gave me


791
00:40:38.704 --> 00:40:40.194
an electric eel as a toy.

792
00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:41.365
Eep!

793
00:40:41.407 --> 00:40:42.704
Yeah, that was fun.

794
00:40:42.742 --> 00:40:43.868
Or he'd rock me in my cradle

795
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:45.878
real, real, real hard
and l'd lose me formula.


796
00:40:45.912 --> 00:40:49.370
And then he'd say, ''One
day, you'll be a sailor.''


797
00:40:49.415 --> 00:40:52.111
That... that's what
l am today.


798
00:40:52.151 --> 00:40:55.018
Yeah. Sometimes,
he'd bounce me on his knee.


799
00:40:55.054 --> 00:40:56.885
Most of the time
he'd miss, though


800
00:40:56.923 --> 00:40:59.357
'cause he couldn't see
too well with one eye.


801
00:41:00.827 --> 00:41:02.158
Oh, me pap, yeah.

802
00:41:02.195 --> 00:41:04.493
Well, l'm not waiting
any longer. Hmm.


803
00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.293
Oh, sorry, Miss Oyl.

804
00:41:07.533 --> 00:41:08.659
l was philoscofying.

805
00:41:08.701 --> 00:41:09.998
Mm-hmm.

806
00:41:10.036 --> 00:41:13.005
...between us, got kind of
derailed and...


807
00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:14.973
Oh, yeah, long time waiting.

808
00:41:15.007 --> 00:41:16.668
Wait a while..

809
00:41:16.709 --> 00:41:19.303
What are you doing
with that basket?


810
00:41:19.345 --> 00:41:21.040
Well, l-l'm carrying it.

811
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.014
lt's your basket, ain't it?

812
00:41:23.049 --> 00:41:24.175
lt is not my basket.

813
00:41:24.217 --> 00:41:26.685
Somebody has deliberately
painted that basket


814
00:41:26.786 --> 00:41:28.117
to look like my basket.

815
00:41:28.154 --> 00:41:29.985
My basket was clean
and beautiful


816
00:41:30.022 --> 00:41:31.421
and this basket is ugly.

817
00:41:31.457 --> 00:41:33.152
-Rattlesnake!
-Miss Oyl, we should at least


818
00:41:33.192 --> 00:41:34.523
have dinner first,
or something.


819
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.584
Rattlesnake!
Rattlesnake!


820
00:41:35.628 --> 00:41:37.027
Oh, rattlesnake!
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!


821
00:41:37.063 --> 00:41:38.792
Rattlesnakes?
Where is it, Miss Oyl?


822
00:41:38.831 --> 00:41:39.388
Where is it?

Well, l could get killed.

1042

What if l won?

1044

Of course l know the words.

1057

They're having a lover's quarrel

Mom, Pop, l'm gonna fight him.

1080
00:52:10.856 --> 00:52:11.823

Get out--
Get my baby outta there!


1084
00:52:16.261 --> 00:52:17.558
Don't touch his feet!

1085
00:52:17.596 --> 00:52:19.621
He's gotta dance
with those feet.


1086
00:52:23.869 --> 00:52:26.133
Castor, we go home now.

1087
00:52:26.171 --> 00:52:27.468
Olive,

1088
00:52:27.506 --> 00:52:28.473
What are you, a nut?

00:52:28.507 --> 00:52:29.565
What good are you, Olive?

1090

Where are my pills?

00:52:34.813 --> 00:52:35.837
Don't do this!

1094
00:52:35.881 --> 00:52:37.746
Mr. Geezil,

1095
00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:39.680
Gentlemen, you know the rules:

1096
00:52:39.718 --> 00:52:40.844
There are no rules.

1097
00:52:40.886 --> 00:52:42.786
This is a fight to the finish.

1098
00:52:44.923 --> 00:52:46.481
First man who is dead, loses.

1099
00:52:46.525 --> 00:52:47.890
Good luck to both of you.

1100
00:52:47.926 --> 00:52:49.393

All right, come over here.

00:52:53.398 --> 00:52:55.263
Now don't, don't kill him.

1105
00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.995
Just fluff him up a bit.

1106
00:53:01.339 --> 00:53:03.807
You'll be leading
with the left hand.


1107
00:53:03.842 --> 00:53:06.834
Castor! Castor,

00:53:30.769 --> 00:53:32.066
Come on, Castor.

1115
00:53:32.103 --> 00:53:33.593
Come on, knock him.

1116

Don't make him mad, Castor.

1122
00:53:50.288 --> 00:53:51.448

You can take him!

You see?

You're letting his
mother's be distracting you.

Oh, there it is.

1200
00:58:31.335 --> 00:58:32.996

Look it there, Olives.
He's got my eye.


1202
00:58:40.211 --> 00:58:41.906
He does not have your eyes.

1203
00:58:41.946 --> 00:58:44.414
He's got my eyes.
He's got your mouth.


1204
00:58:44.449 --> 00:58:45.381
Dizzy dame.

Yeah, you like that,

1208
00:58:54.125 --> 00:58:55.922
And we'll move

1209
00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.120
on a shady lane.

00:58:57.161 --> 00:58:59.561
And we'll garden together,

What is that glop you're eating?

1238
01:00:55.213 --> 01:00:56.237
lt's a soup burger.

1239
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.975
These are difficult times.

1240
01:00:58.015 --> 01:00:59.243
Burgers can't be choosers.

1241
01:00:59.283 --> 01:01:00.409
Phooey.

1242

Work is what is making
the heart grow stronger. Come.


1243
01:01:03.588 --> 01:01:04.850
Open wide.

1244
01:01:04.889 --> 01:01:05.878
Bye, Mom.

1245
01:01:05.923 --> 01:01:07.618
Ow!

1246
01:01:07.658 --> 01:01:09.353
Worry, worry, worry.

1247
01:01:11.195 --> 01:01:12.321
Now... there!

1248
01:01:12.363 --> 01:01:14.422
Well, hope the taxes
don't come to too much.


1249
01:01:14.465 --> 01:01:18.162
Oh, the main thing is
that you're all right.


1250
01:01:18.202 --> 01:01:20.500
Yeah.

1251
01:01:20.538 --> 01:01:21.732
Well, were you worried

1252
01:01:21.806 --> 01:01:25.037
that l might have gotten killed
or something, maybe, yeah?


1253
01:01:25.076 --> 01:01:26.236
Oh, Popeye, don't be silly.

1254
01:01:26.277 --> 01:01:27.608
l knew.

1255
01:01:27.645 --> 01:01:30.239
Oh, you... you didn't
have no confidenkce.


1256
01:01:30.281 --> 01:01:31.407
Oh, l did, too.

1257
01:01:31.449 --> 01:01:32.507
Mm-hmm, yeah.

1258
01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:33.608
l did, too.

1259
01:01:33.651 --> 01:01:34.743
After l asked Swee'pea.

1260
01:01:34.785 --> 01:01:35.911
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1261
01:01:35.953 --> 01:01:37.079
That's rich.

1262
01:01:37.121 --> 01:01:39.351
Oh, you're gone now.
You're really a dizzy dame.


1263
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:40.618
Oh, l asked Swee'pea,

1264
01:01:40.658 --> 01:01:41.750
and he told me.

1265
01:01:41.859 --> 01:01:43.121
lsn't that so?

1266
01:01:48.266 --> 01:01:50.200
What's this here?

1267
01:01:50.234 --> 01:01:52.259
See, l asked Swee'pea,

1268
01:01:52.303 --> 01:01:55.170
''Swee'pea,
will Popeye be killed?''


1269
01:01:55.206 --> 01:01:56.673
-Uh-uh.
-No?


1270
01:01:56.707 --> 01:02:00.006
So then l asked,

1271
01:02:00.044 --> 01:02:03.343
''Swee'pea, will Popeye
be seriously maimed?''


1272
01:02:05.049 --> 01:02:06.277
No?

1273
01:02:07.818 --> 01:02:08.716
That's two for two.

1274
01:02:08.819 --> 01:02:10.616
That could happen
to anybody, ya know.


1275
01:02:10.655 --> 01:02:14.455
So then l queried, ''Swee'pea,

1276
01:02:14.492 --> 01:02:16.687
will Popeye actually survive?''

1277
01:02:18.596 --> 01:02:20.325
Yeah, l survived.
Yeah, yeah.


1278
01:02:20.364 --> 01:02:21.956
''What? You mean he'll win?''

1279
01:02:23.167 --> 01:02:24.395
Oh!

1280
01:02:24.435 --> 01:02:26.027
That's-that's a neat trick.

1281
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:29.597
Oh-ho, me infant
is a psychic of profiks.


1282
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.437
lf l didn't see it
with me own eye,


1283
01:02:31.475 --> 01:02:32.703
l wouldn't believe it.

1284
01:02:32.743 --> 01:02:34.734
That kid's a regular forecaster.

1285
01:02:34.779 --> 01:02:37.612
Remind me to ask him
about gold futures.


1286
01:02:37.648 --> 01:02:41.140
More interested in talking to
him about immediate futures.


1287
01:02:41.185 --> 01:02:42.152
Uh, Popeye?

1288
01:02:42.186 --> 01:02:43.312
Yeah?

1289
01:02:43.354 --> 01:02:44.844
He's an adorable
little fellow.


1290
01:02:44.889 --> 01:02:46.754
And he's a psychic, too.
Ain't that the truth.


1291
01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:48.486
But he looks
a little peaked to me.


1292
01:02:48.526 --> 01:02:50.994
He needs some air.

1293
01:02:51.028 --> 01:02:54.122
Air? That's all
we have here is air.


1294
01:02:54.165 --> 01:02:55.757
With your permission, Popeye,

1295
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.427
l'll... take him
for a little walk.


1296
01:02:57.468 --> 01:02:58.435
Well, Wimpy, why not?

1297
01:02:58.469 --> 01:02:59.868
l mean, you're like his uncle.

1298
01:02:59.904 --> 01:03:01.030
You're his Uncle Wimp.

1299
01:03:02.106 --> 01:03:03.403
Yeah, that's it.

1300
01:03:03.441 --> 01:03:04.499
Come along.

1301
01:03:04.542 --> 01:03:05.873
Hey, don't forget
his little hat here.


1302
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:06.877
Don't forget his hat.

1303
01:03:06.911 --> 01:03:07.878
He's going out in uniform.

1304
01:03:07.912 --> 01:03:08.879
Oh, of course.

1305
01:03:08.913 --> 01:03:09.880
There you go.

1306
01:03:09.914 --> 01:03:10.881
Thank you.

1307
01:03:10.915 --> 01:03:11.904
Ain't that something?

1308
01:03:11.949 --> 01:03:12.973
He's taking him for a walk.

01:03:16.587 --> 01:03:17.554
He can't walks yet.

01:03:17.588 --> 01:03:18.850
Oh, l'll carry him.

1314
01:03:18.889 --> 01:03:20.686
Oh, in that case,
it's all right then.


1315
01:03:20.725 --> 01:03:23.057
As long as you take him
for a drags or something.


1316
01:03:23.094 --> 01:03:24.721
Hey, l want to carry him
for a walk.


1317
01:03:24.762 --> 01:03:25.956
Oh, leave him be there, Olive.

1318
01:03:25.997 --> 01:03:28.522
lt's Uncle Wimps
going with the Swee'pea.


1319
01:03:28.566 --> 01:03:31.000
Oh, yeah, Wimpy can take
him but l can't? Hmm.


1320
01:03:31.035 --> 01:03:32.468
Well, um...

1321
01:03:32.503 --> 01:03:34.471
wh-who says you can't?

1322
01:03:34.505 --> 01:03:36.234
You said l can't. Hmm.

1323
01:03:36.273 --> 01:03:38.741
Oh. Well, um...

1324
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:40.538
that was before.

1325
01:03:40.578 --> 01:03:42.569
Before what?

1326
01:03:42.613 --> 01:03:45.241
Well, um...

1327
01:03:45.282 --> 01:03:50.413
before l... l knew
you was worried about me.


1328
01:03:50.454 --> 01:03:52.354
Oh!

1329
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:53.414
Oh.

1330
01:03:53.457 --> 01:03:55.687
You mean, now l can carry him

1331
01:03:55.726 --> 01:03:58.126
just because
l was worried about you?


1332
01:03:58.162 --> 01:03:59.686
Yes. Yes, mm-hmm.

1333
01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:02.164
Phooey.

1334
01:04:02.199 --> 01:04:03.359
Phooey?

1335
01:04:03.401 --> 01:04:04.800
Mm.

1336
01:04:04.835 --> 01:04:06.325
Y
-You said ''phooey'' to me?

1337
01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:09.237
l said ''phooey''
and l mean ''phooey.''


1338
01:04:09.273 --> 01:04:10.501
Phooey.

1339
01:04:14.645 --> 01:04:16.272
She said ''phooey'' to me.

1340
01:04:16.313 --> 01:04:18.042
She said...

1341
01:04:18.082 --> 01:04:20.346
''phooey'' to me.

1342
01:04:27.758 --> 01:04:29.726
We have Lickety Split,
number one.


1343
01:04:29.794 --> 01:04:32.024
Number three, Sandcrab.

1344
01:04:32.063 --> 01:04:33.155
How 'bout six?

1345
01:04:34.265 --> 01:04:35.323
Everything's going
to be all right.


1346
01:04:35.366 --> 01:04:36.424
Now, he's with
his Uncle Wimps,


1347
01:04:36.467 --> 01:04:38.059
and they've only been gone
for a couple of hours.


1348
01:04:38.102 --> 01:04:39.069
Yeah, couple of hours.

1349
01:04:39.103 --> 01:04:40.400
Ooh, wait a minute.

1350
01:04:40.438 --> 01:04:41.928
This town could have been
built in a couple of hours.


1351
01:04:41.972 --> 01:04:43.098
Whoo!

1352
01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.074
Oh, got to be trustworthy.
Wimps is trustworthy.


1353
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:47.407
Wait a minute, l don't trust him
as far as l can throw him.


1354
01:04:47.445 --> 01:04:48.742
Throw him?
l can't even lift him.


1355
01:04:48.779 --> 01:04:49.939
l don't see them anywhere.

1356
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.312
Well, maybe they went
to the Rough House.


1357
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:54.112
No, Wimpy's barred
from the Rough House.


1358
01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:55.118
-Bad credit.
-Right.


1359
01:04:55.152 --> 01:04:57.712
Oh, my stars and horses!

1360
01:04:57.755 --> 01:04:59.552
Derby day?

1361
01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.285
That rat Wimpy.

1362
01:05:01.325 --> 01:05:02.792
What's this got to do
with me Swee'pea?


1363
01:05:02.827 --> 01:05:04.192
They've gone to the races.

1364
01:05:04.228 --> 01:05:05.957
A baby at the horse races.

1365
01:05:05.996 --> 01:05:07.429
Where is these races?

1366
01:05:07.465 --> 01:05:09.092
Come on. Let's go.

1367
01:05:15.506 --> 01:05:18.532
Come on! Come on!

1368
01:05:26.984 --> 01:05:29.009
Oh!

1369
01:05:40.831 --> 01:05:42.196
And the winner is...

1370
01:05:42.233 --> 01:05:44.201
Cat's Pajamas.

1371
01:05:44.235 --> 01:05:45.361
Yippee!

1372
01:05:45.402 --> 01:05:47.199
We've done it.

1373
01:05:47.238 --> 01:05:48.728
Oh, that Wimps.

1374
01:05:48.806 --> 01:05:50.865
Abducticating me Swee'pea there.

1375
01:05:50.908 --> 01:05:52.933
Oh, a race track
ain't no nurskery.


1376
01:05:52.977 --> 01:05:55.207
Oh, patience, patience.

1377
01:05:55.246 --> 01:05:56.213
Got to remain calm.

1378
01:05:56.247 --> 01:05:57.578
That's it.

1379
01:05:57.615 --> 01:05:58.741
Straight ahead.

1380
01:06:02.253 --> 01:06:03.720
Lonesome, chubby?

1381
01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:11.387
We've got it. Look.

1382
01:06:11.428 --> 01:06:13.225
The Wax Doors and Gardeners?

1383
01:06:13.264 --> 01:06:15.789
No. Number two, Ed.

1384
01:06:15.833 --> 01:06:16.822
Ed?

1385
01:06:16.867 --> 01:06:18.232
That's a horse.

1386
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:21.261
All right...
number six, Holy Moly.


1387
01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.071
You like Holy Moly?

1388
01:06:24.108 --> 01:06:25.234
Holy Moly?

1389
01:06:25.276 --> 01:06:26.971
Holy Moly.

1390
01:06:27.011 --> 01:06:28.376
That's it, Holy Moly.

1391
01:06:28.412 --> 01:06:29.606
We can't lose.

1392
01:06:29.647 --> 01:06:31.672
Everything on Holy Moly.

1393

Oh, what is this?

1401
01:07:05.716 --> 01:07:07.013
A house of ill repukes?

1402
01:07:07.051 --> 01:07:11.681
Ooh, who'd bring me infant
to this den of immoraliky?


1403
01:07:11.755 --> 01:07:13.848
Don't touch nothin'. You might
get a venerable disease.


1404
01:07:13.891 --> 01:07:15.290
Oh. Ooh. Ooh!

1405
01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:17.351

1406
01:07:17.394 --> 01:07:19.589
Hello. Better grab me loins up
for this one.


1407
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:21.063
Read your paper, Cole.

1408
01:07:23.434 --> 01:07:25.197
Will you...?

1409
01:07:25.236 --> 01:07:27.898
You know, if Mom caught me
in here she'd kill me.


1410
01:07:27.938 --> 01:07:29.701
There's Mom.

1411
01:07:29.807 --> 01:07:31.331
Where is that Wimpy?

1412
01:07:33.744 --> 01:07:34.938
Oh!

Oh! Oh!

-There he is.


1418
01:07:47.091 --> 01:07:48.058
Wimpy, l'm disgustapated.

1419
01:07:48.092 --> 01:07:49.719
May l borrow the infant

1420
01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.920
Oh, well, yes,
for just a moment.


1421
01:07:50.961 --> 01:07:52.258
l don't want
your little sweet peepers


1422
01:07:52.296 --> 01:07:53.388
to see what's about to happen.

1423
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:54.897
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1424
01:07:54.932 --> 01:07:57.196

1425
01:07:57.234 --> 01:07:59.031

You won 120 simoleons?

1428
01:08:02.706 --> 01:08:04.230
You know how many hamburgers
that is?


1429
01:08:04.275 --> 01:08:05.537
Put your eye
where your ear is.


1430
01:08:05.576 --> 01:08:06.668
Disgraceful.
How many races?


1431
01:08:06.777 --> 01:08:07.937
Two races.

1432
01:08:07.978 --> 01:08:09.912
Hmm, let me see
that racing form.


1433
01:08:09.947 --> 01:08:11.847
Oh, maybe we can...

01:08:11.882 --> 01:08:13.577
Oh, Swee'pea?
We, oh... oh, now...


1435
01:08:13.617 --> 01:08:14.948
Wait, no.
No child of mine


1436
01:08:14.985 --> 01:08:16.282

a raceking kout.


1437
01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:17.287
Come on, me little...

What are you doing there?

1441
01:08:25.062 --> 01:08:26.529
No childs of mine

01:08:26.563 --> 01:08:27.530

Yeah, that's true.

1444
01:08:28.565 --> 01:08:29.998
You're going to be
a president one day.


1445
01:08:30.034 --> 01:08:31.592
lt is not ill-gotten,
it's good-gotten gains.


1446
01:08:31.635 --> 01:08:33.364
These gains with cloth us
and feed us and save us.


1447
01:08:33.404 --> 01:08:35.201
Wrong is wrong even
when it helps you.


1448
01:08:35.239 --> 01:08:36.331
The horses are at the gate.

1449
01:08:36.373 --> 01:08:39.809
Oh, family is more important
than dumb morality, hmm.


1450
01:08:39.843 --> 01:08:41.970
Oh, look, he's got
something in his eye.


1451

01:09:01.398 --> 01:09:02.956
Oh, make it snappy.

What am l?

1466
01:09:10.841 --> 01:09:12.832
Some kind of judge or lawyers?

1467
01:09:15.346 --> 01:09:19.373
Maybe not, but l knows
what law suitks me.


1468
01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:21.680
Careful there,

1469
01:09:21.752 --> 01:09:24.186
What am l?

01:09:24.221 --> 01:09:27.679

01:09:29.059 --> 01:09:32.028

And l yam what l yam what

1474

And that's all that l yam

1475
01:09:37.034 --> 01:09:38.194
'Cause l yam what l yam

1476
01:09:39.403 --> 01:09:40.370
You've got it?

1477
01:09:40.404 --> 01:09:41.336
l think so, yes.

1478
01:09:42.906 --> 01:09:45.534
And l got a lot of muskle,
and l only gots one eye


1479
01:09:45.576 --> 01:09:48.511
And l never hurts nobodys,
and l'll never tell a lie


1480
01:09:48.545 --> 01:09:51.070
Top to me bottoms
from the bottoms to me top


1481
01:09:51.115 --> 01:09:53.709
That's the way it is

1482
01:09:53.751 --> 01:09:56.219

1485
01:10:02.025 --> 01:10:03.720
Here he comes.
Come on, Sucking Lemon.


1486
01:10:03.761 --> 01:10:04.728
What l yam, what l yam

1487
01:10:04.762 --> 01:10:06.024
Oh, come on, get up there. Ooh!

1488
01:10:06.063 --> 01:10:07.189
Wondered about meself.

1489
01:10:07.231 --> 01:10:09.256
To be or not to be--
who's axskin'?


1490
01:10:09.299 --> 01:10:12.393
l can open up an ockean,
l can take a lot of sail


1491
01:10:12.436 --> 01:10:15.837
l can lose a lot of waters,
and l'll never have to bail


1492
01:10:15.873 --> 01:10:18.103
On the coast of Madagascar,
grab a whale by the tail


1493
01:10:18.142 --> 01:10:19.109
Boy, let's go get it.

1494
01:10:19.143 --> 01:10:20.405
What am l?

1495
01:10:20.444 --> 01:10:22.571

1497
01:10:23.947 --> 01:10:26.745

1498
01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:29.580
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1499
01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:32.088
l'm Popeye, the sailor

1500
01:10:32.122 --> 01:10:34.750
l yam what l yam,
and that's all that l yam


1501
01:10:34.792 --> 01:10:37.590
l yam what l yam
what l yam what l yam


1502
01:10:37.628 --> 01:10:40.062
l'm Popeye, the sailor man.

1503
01:10:40.097 --> 01:10:41.428
Ha-ha!

1504
01:10:41.465 --> 01:10:44.730
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1505
01:10:47.805 --> 01:10:50.239
Arms, don't fail me now.

1506
01:11:01.652 --> 01:11:04.917
l am what l am
and that's all that l am


1507
01:11:04.955 --> 01:11:07.651
l'm Popeye, the sailor man.

1508
01:11:08.926 --> 01:11:13.420
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1509
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:35.714
Whoo, hoo-hoo!

1510
01:11:39.852 --> 01:11:41.513
Oh, l hate to do this,
Swee'pea,


1511
01:11:41.553 --> 01:11:43.350
but it's neskessary.

1512
01:11:43.389 --> 01:11:45.584
Sometimes you got to do things
you don't want to do


1513
01:11:45.624 --> 01:11:46.955
when you got to do 'em, but...

1514
01:11:46.992 --> 01:11:48.118
Oh, it's cruel, Mr. Eye...

1515
01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.128
lt may not make sense now
but maybe later.


1516
01:11:50.162 --> 01:11:51.789
...uh, Mr. Pop...
um, Mr. Popeye.


1517
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:53.320
l'm sorry, Mrs. Oyl,

1518
01:11:53.365 --> 01:11:56.300
but it's parenk's duty
to protect me adopticated son


1519
01:11:56.335 --> 01:11:57.302
from child abusk.

1520
01:11:57.336 --> 01:11:58.803
Oh, oh, but think of Olive.

1521
01:11:58.837 --> 01:12:02.603
You can't take the poor baby
away from poor Olive.


1522
01:12:02.641 --> 01:12:03.938
Me moraliky ain't bilge,
Mrs. Oyl.


1523
01:12:03.976 --> 01:12:05.637
Me mind is set,
and when me mind is set,


1524
01:12:05.677 --> 01:12:07.508
l don't think from nothin'.

1525
01:12:07.546 --> 01:12:08.535
You sure about that?

1526
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.706
Yeah, l think so, yes.

1527
01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:13.911
Maybe we owe him an apology.

1528
01:12:13.952 --> 01:12:16.614
We'll find another place
to plant ourselves. Yeah.


1529
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:18.984
Me, l'll check you, okay?

1530
01:12:19.024 --> 01:12:21.356
Yeah, you all right there?
This ain't bad, is it?


1531
01:12:21.393 --> 01:12:23.258
lt ain't the Ritz,
but at least you get


1532
01:12:23.295 --> 01:12:24.887
a little womb service here, huh?

1533
01:12:26.365 --> 01:12:28.060
lt ain't no palatkial
mansion either,


1534
01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.089
but we got something.

1535
01:12:29.134 --> 01:12:31.102
Best l ever saw.

1536
01:12:31.136 --> 01:12:32.433
lt's got your blankets here.

1537
01:12:32.471 --> 01:12:33.597
Yeah, there we goes.

1538
01:12:33.639 --> 01:12:34.606
Got your blankets.

1539
01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.664
Here we go.

1540
01:12:35.707 --> 01:12:37.402
You moved out of the Oyl's?

1541
01:12:37.443 --> 01:12:38.933
None of your business.

1542
01:12:38.977 --> 01:12:40.410
$4.25, moving out tax.

1543
01:12:40.446 --> 01:12:43.279
Nuts to you,
and nuts to your taxes.


1544
01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:44.441
You moved in here?

1545
01:12:44.483 --> 01:12:45.609
What's it look like?

1546
01:12:45.651 --> 01:12:46.777
$5.25, moving-in tax.

1547
01:12:46.852 --> 01:12:48.444
Oh, don't forget double nuts.

1548
01:12:48.487 --> 01:12:49.977
And where's this baby
come from?


1549
01:12:50.022 --> 01:12:51.489
Oh, this pelican's
brought him.


1550
01:12:51.523 --> 01:12:54.583
89 cents--
unlicensed baby tax.


1551
01:12:54.626 --> 01:12:56.685
Oh, get out of here!

1552
01:12:56.728 --> 01:12:57.695
Don't take me personal.

1553
01:12:57.729 --> 01:12:58.559
Hey, oh-oh, oh, no!

1554
01:13:11.143 --> 01:13:16.342
Hoop... hoop... hoopla!

1555
01:13:16.381 --> 01:13:17.746
Did ya see that,
what he did?


1556
01:13:17.783 --> 01:13:19.546
A whole lot of peoples.

1557
01:13:26.458 --> 01:13:28.221
Oh, thank you.

1558
01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:37.393
Go tax the fishes!

1559
01:14:12.104 --> 01:14:15.403
Swee'pea? Swee'pea? Swee'pea?

1560
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.409
Where's Swee'pea?

1561
01:14:18.443 --> 01:14:20.274
Swee'pea!

1562
01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.413
Where's Swee'pea?!

1563
01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:27.509
Swee'pea!

1564
01:14:27.553 --> 01:14:32.047
Swee'pea!

1565
01:15:02.754 --> 01:15:07.384
lt's me own fault
Swee'pea's been kidnapped.


1566
01:15:07.426 --> 01:15:09.360
Olives was right.

1567
01:15:09.394 --> 01:15:14.559
Even an orphan needs
a mudder and a fadder.


1568
01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.124
Oh..

1569
01:15:16.168 --> 01:15:18.136
lf l was going to
be Swee'pea's mudder,


1570
01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:20.570
l should have at least
let her be his fadder.


1571
01:15:20.606 --> 01:15:23.234
Ovisk ovisk.

1572
01:15:23.275 --> 01:15:24.435
Oh...

1573
01:15:24.476 --> 01:15:28.242
l ain't man enough
to be a mudder.


1574
01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:32.080
And all at once l knew,
l knew at once


1575
01:15:32.117 --> 01:15:35.609
l knew he needed me

1576
01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:46.458
Until the day l die, l won't
know why l knew he needed me


1577
01:15:50.969 --> 01:15:53.062
lt could be fantasy

1578
01:15:53.105 --> 01:15:57.269
Oh-oh

1579
01:15:57.309 --> 01:16:01.075
Or maybe it's because

1580
01:16:01.113 --> 01:16:05.880
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me


1581
01:16:05.917 --> 01:16:09.250
He needs me, he needs me

1582
01:16:13.925 --> 01:16:21.024
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, da


1583
01:16:22.467 --> 01:16:25.402
lt's like a dime a dance,
l'll take a chance


1584
01:16:25.437 --> 01:16:29.100
l will because he needs me

1585
01:16:33.945 --> 01:16:37.073
No one ever asked before,
before


1586
01:16:37.115 --> 01:16:40.016
Because
they never needed me...


1587
01:16:40.052 --> 01:16:42.646
But l do.

1588
01:16:42.688 --> 01:16:45.418
But he does!

1589
01:16:45.457 --> 01:16:50.588
Maybe it's because
he's so alone


1590
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:56.431
Maybe it's because
he's never had a home


1591
01:16:56.468 --> 01:17:00.131
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me


1592
01:17:00.172 --> 01:17:03.903
He needs me, he needs me

1593
01:17:06.912 --> 01:17:09.540
For once, for once in life

1594
01:17:09.581 --> 01:17:13.881
l finally felt
that someone needed me


1595
01:17:19.091 --> 01:17:24.393
And if it turns out real

1596
01:17:24.429 --> 01:17:29.059
Then love can turn the wheel

1597
01:17:29.101 --> 01:17:31.569
Because he needs me,
he needs me


1598
01:17:31.603 --> 01:17:36.802
He needs me, he needs me,
he needs me, he needs me


1599
01:17:42.314 --> 01:17:47.752
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, dum


1600
01:17:47.786 --> 01:17:55.283
Da-da, da, da, da, da,
da-da, da-da, da.


1601
01:18:39.938 --> 01:18:42.429
Bye-bye.

1602
01:18:46.144 --> 01:18:48.738
Dear...

1603
01:18:48.814 --> 01:18:50.873
Swee'peas.

1604
01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:54.408
Everybody's gotta have
somebodys


1605
01:18:54.453 --> 01:18:57.251
Even if it's only mes

1606

l don't knows if you cares

1610
01:19:09.401 --> 01:19:12.199
You could've come
from Heavens


1611
01:19:12.237 --> 01:19:15.206
Or a typhoon anywhere

1612
01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:21.543
Well, me, l came from Heaven
of Cuddly Na-La Lagoon


1613
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:27.712
And l was told me mammy
gave me up in a typhoon


1614
01:19:27.752 --> 01:19:30.585
Well, don't you cry,
little Swee'pea


1615
01:19:30.622 --> 01:19:34.058
You and me,
we's both the same


1616
01:19:34.092 --> 01:19:36.720
And the biggest tear
l ever seen


1617
01:19:36.761 --> 01:19:40.219
Came in the eye
of a hurricane


1618
01:19:40.265 --> 01:19:45.931
Go to sleep, sleep, sleepy,
now tell me what you sees


1619
01:19:45.971 --> 01:19:52.774
And someday when you's older
l'll tell you's all about me.


1620
01:19:53.879 --> 01:19:55.744
''Love...

1621
01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:58.772

01:22:54.789 --> 01:22:56.416
This kid can predict the future.

So don't talk to me

-Oh, a rat.

A kidnapper, and a Commodore.

1782
01:26:46.087 --> 01:26:50.148
l don't listen to the advice
of some dizzy gaming broad.


1783
01:26:50.191 --> 01:26:52.125
-Oh!
-No. They ain't there.


1784
01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.286
And l'm going to prove it.

1785
01:26:53.327 --> 01:26:54.294
Now where ain't they?

1786
01:26:54.328 --> 01:26:55.795
Uh, they ain't
on the Commodore's boat.


1787
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:56.797
-That's where they ain't?
-Mm-hmm.


1788
01:26:56.831 --> 01:26:57.957
Well, if that's
where they ain't,


1789
01:26:57.999 --> 01:26:59.489
that's where l'm going
to prove that they ain't.


1790
01:26:59.534 --> 01:27:00.501
Oh, come on.
Let's do this.


1791
01:27:00.535 --> 01:27:01.524
Oh, Popeye, wait a minute.

1792
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:09.474
Go get 'em, Popeye!

1793
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:10.909
My husband has delegated me

1794
01:27:10.945 --> 01:27:13.243
to inform you
that he's behind you.


1795
01:27:13.281 --> 01:27:14.407
l'd go with you, Popeye,

1796
01:27:14.448 --> 01:27:16.211
but l've a shave
and shampoo awaiting.


1797
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:17.410
Give 'em hell, Popeye!

1798
01:27:17.451 --> 01:27:18.418
Kick 'em in the butt.

1799
01:27:18.452 --> 01:27:19.749
You can count on me,
Mr. Popeye,


1800
01:27:19.854 --> 01:27:20.752
uh, tomorrow.

1801
01:27:20.855 --> 01:27:22.755
See l'd go with you,
but l got to lock up.


1802
01:27:22.857 --> 01:27:24.654
l just hope
he doesn't get hurt.


1803
01:27:24.692 --> 01:27:26.557
l'd go with you, Popeye,
but l got us a cold.


1804
01:27:26.594 --> 01:27:27.856
You know l'd go with you...

1805
01:27:27.895 --> 01:27:29.192
l'd go, Popeye,

1806
01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:30.356
but the piano man's...

1807
01:27:30.398 --> 01:27:31.990
He's coming.
Revolution is waiting.


1808
01:27:32.033 --> 01:27:33.193
Oh, are you going?

1809
01:27:33.234 --> 01:27:34.326
Heard it's impartial.

1810
01:27:41.008 --> 01:27:42.305
l ain't going.
Are you going?


1811
01:27:42.343 --> 01:27:43.469
-Not me.
-l ain't going.


1812
01:27:43.511 --> 01:27:45.411
lf l wasn't afraid
of the water, l'd go.


1813
01:27:45.446 --> 01:27:46.640
Make 'em dance, Popeye.

1814
01:27:46.681 --> 01:27:48.546
Almost brought you
a bottle of Pepsi.


1815
01:27:48.583 --> 01:27:49.709
Clean up on 'em, Popeye.

1816
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:51.581
Nauseating.

1817
01:27:51.619 --> 01:27:53.587
Don't worry,
l'm going with you,


1818
01:27:53.621 --> 01:27:54.588
but good luck.

1819
01:27:54.622 --> 01:27:56.613
ls this where he ain't?

1820
01:28:07.935 --> 01:28:09.459
Hey, hey.

1821
01:28:09.503 --> 01:28:10.731
Come on, you...

1822
01:28:10.771 --> 01:28:13.296
Come on. Hey.

1823
01:28:13.341 --> 01:28:15.366
Hey.

1825
01:28:24.619 --> 01:28:28.214
Truth is, you ain't here...

1826
01:28:29.490 --> 01:28:31.458

Pap?

1832
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:10.119
Poppa?

1833
01:29:11.932 --> 01:29:13.126
Pa...

1834
01:29:13.167 --> 01:29:14.293

Yes, sir.

1853
01:29:49.503 --> 01:29:51.903
You're casking shadows
on Poopdeck Pappy.


1854
01:29:51.939 --> 01:29:53.304
Pride of the Pacifiric.

1855
01:29:53.341 --> 01:29:54.774
And father to the shark.

1856
01:29:54.842 --> 01:29:56.332
Brother to the piranhaca.

1857
01:29:56.377 --> 01:29:58.242
Cousin to the killer whale.

1858
01:29:58.279 --> 01:29:59.837
And uncle to the octopussy.

1859

l'm your one and only exspring.

1860
01:30:04.685 --> 01:30:07.518
See, we got the same bulgy arms.

1861
01:30:07.555 --> 01:30:09.648
No resemblance.

1862
01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:11.954
We-we got the same
squinky eye.


1863
01:30:15.029 --> 01:30:17.497
What squinky eye?

1864
01:30:17.531 --> 01:30:19.795
That's going to be hard
for you to see. Oh.


1865
01:30:19.867 --> 01:30:22.097
We got the same pipe, Pap.

1866
01:30:22.136 --> 01:30:24.730
You idiot,
you can't inherit a pipe!


1867
01:30:24.772 --> 01:30:27.206
Ooh.

Nor no female child.

01:30:31.245 --> 01:30:34.078
That no court could prove

1871
01:30:34.115 --> 01:30:36.310
Oh.

1872
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:37.783
Oh, yes.

1873
01:30:39.286 --> 01:30:41.720
There's one way to prove
l ain't your fadder.


1874
01:30:41.756 --> 01:30:44.657
Pick up that can of spinach.

1875
01:30:44.692 --> 01:30:45.818
Pick it up!

1876
01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:47.020
Yeah.

1877
01:30:49.563 --> 01:30:50.928
Now bring it over here.

1878
01:30:50.965 --> 01:30:52.159
Yeah. Yeah.

1879
01:30:52.199 --> 01:30:53.427
Now eat it.

1880
01:30:53.467 --> 01:30:54.593
Eat it?

1881
01:30:54.635 --> 01:30:55.761
Eat it.

1882
01:30:55.803 --> 01:30:56.929
Raw?

1883
01:30:56.971 --> 01:30:59.235
Eat it raw.

1884
01:31:00.241 --> 01:31:01.208
Eat that spinach.

1885
01:31:01.242 --> 01:31:02.209
l don't want to eat...

1886
01:31:02.243 --> 01:31:03.210
Eat the spinach,
you brat.


1887
01:31:03.244 --> 01:31:04.268
l don't want to eat
that spinach.


1888
01:31:04.311 --> 01:31:05.437
Oh!

1889
01:31:05.479 --> 01:31:06.776
l don't want to eat
that spinach.


1890
01:31:06.847 --> 01:31:07.779
l don't want to eat...

1891
01:31:07.815 --> 01:31:09.077
Eat that spinach!

1892
01:31:09.116 --> 01:31:13.780
Oh, you disobedient brat.

1893
01:31:13.854 --> 01:31:15.947
You was disobedient
when you was two,


1894
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:17.890
and you're still
disobedient now!


1895
01:31:17.925 --> 01:31:19.620
You wouldn't eat your spinach.

1896
01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:21.651
Spinach what kept
our family strong


1897
01:31:21.695 --> 01:31:23.026
for thousands of years.

1898
01:31:23.063 --> 01:31:25.497
And what does me only
oxspring do with it?


1899
01:31:25.533 --> 01:31:26.966
He spits it up.

1900
01:31:27.001 --> 01:31:28.025
His mother ups and dies,

1901
01:31:28.068 --> 01:31:29.501
and he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1902
01:31:29.537 --> 01:31:30.526
She choked on it, Pop.

1903
01:31:30.571 --> 01:31:31.538
His poppa out of work,

1904
01:31:31.572 --> 01:31:33.005
and he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1905
01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.132
lt wasn't my fault.

1906
01:31:34.175 --> 01:31:35.642
The whole country
in a depressigan.


1907
01:31:36.911 --> 01:31:38.640
And he wouldn't eat his spinach.

1908
01:31:38.679 --> 01:31:39.976
That was Coolidge, Poppa.

1909
01:31:40.014 --> 01:31:41.242
His poppa going hungry.

1910
01:31:41.282 --> 01:31:42.340
Going off to steal.

1911
01:31:42.383 --> 01:31:43.509
Stealing what?

1912
01:31:43.551 --> 01:31:44.984
Spinach.

1913
01:31:45.019 --> 01:31:49.012
So his ungrate son
could grow up big and strong.


1914
01:31:49.056 --> 01:31:50.148
You know what l done?

1915
01:31:50.191 --> 01:31:52.659
You know what l done
when the G man catched me


1916
01:31:52.693 --> 01:31:53.819
and thrung me in jail?

1917
01:31:53.928 --> 01:31:55.054

01:31:55.095 --> 01:31:56.392
-l laughed.
-Yeah. You laughed?


1919
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:58.057
l laughed a whole year.

1920
01:32:01.702 --> 01:32:03.670
Cut me down
from this yardarm.


1921
01:32:03.704 --> 01:32:05.331
Getting away with that rotten
little insect


1922
01:32:05.372 --> 01:32:06.339
of a stool pigeon.

1923
01:32:06.373 --> 01:32:07.340
Cut you down?

1924
01:32:07.374 --> 01:32:08.363
Cut me down!

1925
01:32:08.409 --> 01:32:09.376
Cut me down.

1926
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:10.604
Cut you down, cut you down.

1927
01:32:10.644 --> 01:32:11.576

Are you serious?

1930
01:32:17.451 --> 01:32:18.782
Well, you said cut you down.

1931
01:32:18.819 --> 01:32:20.548
l didn't say cut me down.

1932
01:32:20.588 --> 01:32:22.783
l said get me down,

1933
01:32:22.890 --> 01:32:26.792
Oh, oh, unhand me, you brute!

1934
01:32:26.861 --> 01:32:28.658
Oh, what are you doing?

1935
01:32:28.696 --> 01:32:30.596
What?! Oh!

1936

Come down here, Bluto!

1937
01:32:33.801 --> 01:32:36.031
And don't you ever
pick up another knife.


1938
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:37.799
lf you do,
l'll make you eat it.


1939
01:32:37.905 --> 01:32:40.499
You'll be known as
the sword-swallowing sailor.


1940
01:32:41.675 --> 01:32:42.642
That's me pap.

That's me pap, l know he is.

1942
01:32:44.078 --> 01:32:47.309
Oh, what is all

1944
01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:50.947
Oh, Popeye!

1945
01:32:50.985 --> 01:32:52.350
All hands on deck.

1946
01:32:54.755 --> 01:32:56.382
Come on, haul ass, haul ass.

1947
01:32:56.423 --> 01:32:57.651
They're on the vile body.

1948
01:32:57.691 --> 01:32:58.817
Miss Oyl, that's me fadder.

1949
01:32:58.859 --> 01:32:59.826
No!

1950
01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.794
Your pappy's a Commodore?!

1951
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.397
Follow me, get out of here.

1952
01:33:07.434 --> 01:33:09.664
He's got him! Bluto's
got Olive and Swee'pea!


1953
01:33:09.703 --> 01:33:11.637
Olive? Olive?

1954
01:33:11.672 --> 01:33:15.130
Help! Popeye!

1955
01:33:15.175 --> 01:33:17.040
Olive! Olive!
Who got me Olive?


1956
01:33:17.077 --> 01:33:18.704
l got to get him before
he gets me treasure.


1957
01:33:18.746 --> 01:33:19.713
All of you

1958
01:33:19.747 --> 01:33:21.237
can commandeer it.

1959
01:33:21.282 --> 01:33:23.750
Help, Popeye!

1960
01:33:23.784 --> 01:33:26.116
The wharf, the wharf is moving.

1961
01:33:26.153 --> 01:33:27.552
Shut up, stupid.

1962
01:33:27.588 --> 01:33:28.714
This ain't no wharf.

1963
01:33:28.756 --> 01:33:30.155
This is me getaway boat.

1964
01:33:30.190 --> 01:33:31.521
l'll punch your head.

1965
01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:39.394
Hoist the main mast.

1966
01:33:44.805 --> 01:33:46.636
Hurry up, Popeye!

1967
01:33:46.674 --> 01:33:48.801
You're falling behind!

1968
01:33:48.909 --> 01:33:51.673
And Bluto's getting away!

1969
01:33:51.712 --> 01:33:53.111
Yeah, with us!

1970
01:33:53.147 --> 01:33:56.913
Help!

1971
01:33:59.152 --> 01:34:01.746
What is it?

1972
01:34:01.788 --> 01:34:03.756
lt's a rock.

1973
01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:06.020
lt's a hard place.

1974
01:34:06.059 --> 01:34:08.493
Oh, no. lt's Scab lsland.

1975
01:34:08.528 --> 01:34:09.620
Mom...

1976
01:34:09.663 --> 01:34:11.358
Don't worry, Castor.

1977
01:34:11.398 --> 01:34:13.491
Your father's with us.

1978
01:34:13.533 --> 01:34:17.594
S
-S
-S... Scab lsland!

1979
01:34:17.637 --> 01:34:18.695
Haul ass!

1980
01:34:18.739 --> 01:34:19.763
Haul ass, haul ass.

1981
01:34:19.873 --> 01:34:21.067
Get to your stations.

1982
01:34:21.108 --> 01:34:22.769
Get to your battle stations.

1983
01:34:22.809 --> 01:34:26.711
Oh... oh, phooey!

1984
01:34:28.515 --> 01:34:30.540
What are you doing?
What are you doing?


1985
01:34:30.584 --> 01:34:32.643
Who do you think you are,
Captain Arab?


1986
01:34:32.686 --> 01:34:34.779
l'm trying to save
me Olive Oyl and me Swee'peas.


1987
01:34:34.821 --> 01:34:36.516
Olive Oyl? Swee'pea?

1988
01:34:36.556 --> 01:34:38.922
What are you doing,
making a salad?


1989
01:34:38.959 --> 01:34:41.257
l want me treasure,
do you hear me?


1990
01:34:41.294 --> 01:34:42.556

01:34:42.596 --> 01:34:44.154
l am the Commodore of this ship,

1992
01:34:44.197 --> 01:34:45.789
and don't you give orders on it!

1993
01:34:45.832 --> 01:34:47.732
Oh, yeah? Well,
l'm the Commodore, me friend.


1994
01:34:47.768 --> 01:34:49.133
You command this privy,

01:34:49.169 --> 01:34:50.796
and l'll commands me friends.

1996
01:34:50.837 --> 01:34:52.668
ls that any way to talk
to your fadder?


1997
01:34:52.706 --> 01:34:54.071
You ain't me fadder.

1998
01:34:54.107 --> 01:34:55.267
Me fadder was tall and kind

1999
01:34:55.308 --> 01:34:56.639
and looks like
Abraham Lincoln.


2000
01:34:56.676 --> 01:34:58.644
Yeah, don't tell me what l am.

2001
01:34:58.678 --> 01:35:00.475
Eh? Where'd he go,
where'd he go?


2002
01:35:00.514 --> 01:35:01.742
l says l am your fadder.

2003
01:35:01.848 --> 01:35:04.749
l ought to know whose fadder
l is and whose fadder l ain't.


2004
01:35:04.851 --> 01:35:05.909
Who says?

2005
01:35:05.952 --> 01:35:08.011
l said. l said.

2006
01:35:08.054 --> 01:35:10.750
l says avast, you bilge rat,
before l use you as an anchor.


2007
01:35:10.791 --> 01:35:12.918
Bilge rat, bilge rat,
bilge rat?!


2008
01:35:12.959 --> 01:35:14.085
Mutiny, mutiny!

2009
01:35:14.127 --> 01:35:16.118
l am your one and only fadder.

2010
01:35:16.163 --> 01:35:17.255
Look it, look it--

2011
01:35:17.297 --> 01:35:19.492
Eh...
the same bulgy arms.


2012
01:35:19.533 --> 01:35:20.659
No resemblance.

2013
01:35:20.700 --> 01:35:22.998
Eh, the same squinky eye, eh?

2014
01:35:23.036 --> 01:35:24.003
What squinky eye?

2015
01:35:24.037 --> 01:35:25.004
The squinky eye.

2016
01:35:25.038 --> 01:35:27.768
Help, Popeye! Oh!

2017
01:35:27.874 --> 01:35:31.503
We even got, we even
got the same pipe. Look!


2018
01:35:32.979 --> 01:35:34.241
This ain't me pipe.

2019
01:35:35.816 --> 01:35:37.044
He took the bait.

2020
01:35:37.083 --> 01:35:40.746
Eh, l've never seen anything
like this before in me life.


2021
01:35:40.787 --> 01:35:43.278
Talking to your
poor old fadder like that.


2022
01:35:43.323 --> 01:35:44.881
You disobedient brat.

2023
01:35:44.925 --> 01:35:47.792
You're spoiled--
that's what you are-- spoiled.


2024
01:35:47.828 --> 01:35:51.559
Children. Children. Kids.

2025
01:35:51.598 --> 01:35:53.691
Eh, phooey!

2026
01:35:53.733 --> 01:35:54.722
Phooey!

2027
01:35:54.768 --> 01:35:57.669
Give them everything they want,

2028
01:35:57.704 --> 01:35:58.932
and what'd you get in return?

2029
01:35:58.972 --> 01:36:01.736
Nothing, nothing.

2030
01:36:01.775 --> 01:36:03.242
Nothing but heartache,

2031
01:36:03.276 --> 01:36:05.369
heartache, sadness,
and miserky.


2032
01:36:05.412 --> 01:36:06.936
And a bad time,
once in a while,


2033
01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:09.005
when you try to give them a
bath, and they don't want it.


2034
01:36:09.049 --> 01:36:10.846
And another bad time
when you want to do something


2035
01:36:10.884 --> 01:36:12.749
that you really want to do,
but all they want to do


2036
01:36:12.786 --> 01:36:13.912
is not what you want to do.

2037
01:36:13.954 --> 01:36:15.546
Bless their little hearts.

2038
01:36:15.589 --> 01:36:17.853
lf they were
really made out of gold,


2039
01:36:17.891 --> 01:36:19.552
l'd like to sell them
on the open marketplace.


2040
01:36:19.593 --> 01:36:21.527
l could make me a fortune.

2041
01:36:21.561 --> 01:36:22.892
l could've made us a fortune.
Kids!


2042
01:36:22.929 --> 01:36:27.195
Eh, they don't
know what they're doing.


2043
01:36:27.234 --> 01:36:29.759
Kids, dadblast 'em!

2044
01:36:29.803 --> 01:36:31.100
They're gonna lead you
to ruin.


2045
01:36:31.137 --> 01:36:33.401
That's what they gonna do.
Lead you to ruin.


2046
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:35.271
They cry at you
when they're young,


2047
01:36:35.308 --> 01:36:36.741
they yell at you
when they're older,


2048
01:36:36.776 --> 01:36:38.971
they borrow from yous
when they're middle-aged,


2049
01:36:39.012 --> 01:36:40.639
and they leave you alone
to die...


2050
01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.204
without even paying you back!

2051
01:36:42.249 --> 01:36:45.343
Children. Phooey!

2052
01:36:46.753 --> 01:36:48.015
You give them
everything they want,


2053
01:36:48.054 --> 01:36:49.715
and what do you
get back in return?


2054
01:36:49.756 --> 01:36:51.018
You gets nothing!

2055
01:36:51.057 --> 01:36:53.355
Catch him like
a big, fat lobster.


2056
01:36:53.393 --> 01:36:55.657
Why, they're just smaller
versions of us, you know.


2057
01:36:55.695 --> 01:36:58.027
Well, l'm not so crazy
about me in the first place.


2058
01:36:58.064 --> 01:36:59.622
So why do l want
one of them?


2059
01:36:59.666 --> 01:37:02.464
l'm asking you.
Children.


2060
01:37:02.502 --> 01:37:06.063
Ah, children.
Little children.


2061
01:37:06.106 --> 01:37:07.573
You'll pour
your heart out to them,


2062
01:37:07.607 --> 01:37:09.097
you give them
everything they want,


2063
01:37:09.142 --> 01:37:10.666
give them candy,
and a lot of toys,


2064
01:37:10.710 --> 01:37:11.734
and what do you get back?

2065
01:37:11.778 --> 01:37:12.904
You get a lot of noise.

2066
01:37:12.946 --> 01:37:14.743
Nah-nah-nah-nah, nah, nah.

2067
01:37:14.781 --> 01:37:16.408
My poppa's a mean old man!

2068
01:37:19.719 --> 01:37:22.119
l'm through with children.
l'm through with kids.


2069
01:37:22.155 --> 01:37:25.682
There ain't nothing
l'm never gonna do about it.


2070
01:37:25.725 --> 01:37:28.125
There it is, Pap,
we's got 'em cornered.


2071
01:37:31.898 --> 01:37:35.129
Dad blast
that dirty bilge rat!


2072
01:37:35.168 --> 01:37:36.601
You! You,
with that crazy beard,


2073
01:37:36.636 --> 01:37:37.864
get that fat guy up here.

2074
01:37:37.904 --> 01:37:39.098
Come up here.

2075
01:37:39.139 --> 01:37:40.106
Get up here, get up here.

2076
01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:43.701
Help! Oh! Help me!

2077
01:37:43.743 --> 01:37:45.370
There she is!

2078
01:37:45.412 --> 01:37:46.709
Haul ass, haul ass.

2079
01:37:46.746 --> 01:37:48.270
Get the cannon
and move it here.


2080
01:37:48.315 --> 01:37:51.512
Come on, haul ass,
haul ass, haul ass.


2081
01:37:51.551 --> 01:37:54.111
Get the cannon
and move it here.


2082
01:37:54.154 --> 01:37:55.451
ln a good position, that's it.

2083
01:37:55.488 --> 01:37:56.785
What are you doing?

2084
01:37:56.890 --> 01:37:57.982
You can't fire that thing.

2085
01:37:58.024 --> 01:37:59.651
There's women and infants
on that boat.


2086
01:37:59.693 --> 01:38:00.660
You stop worrying.

2087
01:38:00.694 --> 01:38:03.891
All l'm gonna do
is fire a warning shot


2088
01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:05.056
right across the bow.

2089
01:38:05.098 --> 01:38:07.498
Don't you thinks
l knows what l'm doing?


2090
01:38:10.170 --> 01:38:11.865
Ah, short, short.

2091
01:38:11.905 --> 01:38:13.338
l was a little short.

2092
01:38:13.373 --> 01:38:14.738
A little short?

2093
01:38:14.841 --> 01:38:15.967
Reload it, reload it.
Reload it.


2094
01:38:16.009 --> 01:38:16.998
No, you don't.

2095
01:38:22.515 --> 01:38:24.710
Dadblast it! l missed!

2096
01:38:26.386 --> 01:38:29.014
Full speed ahead.

2097
01:38:29.055 --> 01:38:30.852
Slow down, Pap,
so we can board her.


2098
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:32.187
We're not gonna board her.

2099
01:38:32.225 --> 01:38:34.318
l'm gonna ram him.
l'm gonna ram him.
