Don't need one.

How'd you get tickets?

946
00:57:02.074 --> 00:57:03.282

947
00:57:03.367 --> 00:57:06.911
You run a couple errands for me,
put you on to get you some.


948
00:57:06.953 --> 00:57:09.330
Put some real dollar eagles in your pocket,
you understand?


949
00:57:09.873 --> 00:57:12.375
l just wanted to put
you in my iPad 2.

You know,

952
00:57:17.005 --> 00:57:18.464
What kind of questions
you want to ask me, man?


953
00:57:18.632 --> 00:57:21.258
Like, what do you do
that makes my granddaddy so mad?


954

l didn't do nothing to that old timer, man.

He know that, all right?

956
00:57:28.141 --> 00:57:31.102
That's why l'm out here hustling,
so l get enough dough to make my mix tape.

(RAPPING) lt's hot as hell in this jail cell
Ain't hard to tell

Home of my nigga Melo

Pumping D's in the dice to dream cemetery

lt's grim work, love
Arming my troops

Talk slick

973

We make you eat your words
Alphabet soup

So re-group,
before you think you can step...


975
00:58:10.058 --> 00:58:11.058
Wait, hold up, hold up, hold up.

976
00:58:11.143 --> 00:58:13.394
Now, l don't want you biting my shit, man.
lt ain't copywritten.


977
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.104
What's that?

978
00:58:15.147 --> 00:58:16.731
Don't matter.

979
00:58:16.982 --> 00:58:17.982
Just burn me a copy real quick.

980

ENOCH: Hey, gentlemen,

All right, l'll do it myself!

985
00:58:26.158 --> 00:58:27.533
No. Why you playing?

986
00:58:27.951 --> 00:58:29.076

-Come on, let's go!
-What's wrong with you?


990
00:58:35.208 --> 00:58:37.418
You should know better,
letting him out here without instructions!


991
00:58:37.502 --> 00:58:40.087
He got me on tape!
lt's over for him, it's mine now.


992
00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:41.756
lt's just for his video.

-Mad problems!

Herbert, you known me all your life.

1003
00:59:02.486 --> 00:59:05.696
Whoa, whoa.
Let me help you with that, old man.


1004
00:59:06.698 --> 00:59:08.824
Oh! Pay day, nigga!

1005
00:59:08.867 --> 00:59:10.367
Let me see this.

1006
00:59:17.542 --> 00:59:19.418
-God is great.
-Amen.


1007
00:59:20.921 --> 00:59:23.297
You better delete it.

1008
00:59:23.381 --> 00:59:25.007
Get this lil' nigga out of here.

1009
00:59:25.050 --> 00:59:27.176
Wasted my whole childhood in Lil' Heaven.

1010
00:59:27.302 --> 00:59:28.552
l'm telling you, old man, next time you

1011
00:59:28.595 --> 00:59:30.721
or anybody else from your Jesus sect
come on this court,


1012
00:59:30.764 --> 00:59:32.890
l'm gonna cut your eyelids off,
so you can see me clearly


1013
00:59:32.974 --> 00:59:34.809
before l blast you straight
to Big Heaven, understand?


1014
00:59:34.893 --> 00:59:36.185
And when you get there,

1015
00:59:36.228 --> 00:59:38.813
you can tell God you were
sent there by Satan himself!


1016
00:59:38.897 --> 00:59:40.022
Now step!

1017
00:59:40.774 --> 00:59:43.108
God's loving you every minute, Herbert.

1018
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.820
-Whatever!
-Some preacher bullshit.


1019
00:59:46.905 --> 00:59:49.740
l love this joint, man. 
God is love, baby.

1020
00:59:49.825 --> 00:59:52.076
The almighty dollar, baby.
(LAUGHS) Know what l mean?


1021
00:59:59.543 --> 01:00:02.253
l told you, be careful with that thing!

1022
01:00:02.671 --> 01:00:05.130
l thought you said
Box should come to Lil' Heaven.


1023
01:00:05.215 --> 01:00:06.715
Well, he ain't coming.

1024
01:00:06.758 --> 01:00:08.551
The Lord says,
"Throw out your treasures in heaven,


1025
01:00:08.593 --> 01:00:09.969
"even if others don't follow you!"

1026
01:00:10.053 --> 01:00:12.429
You heard the man say
he's from Satan himself.


1027
01:00:12.472 --> 01:00:15.349
lf you're a man of God, aren't you
supposed to take the devil out of him?


1028
01:00:15.433 --> 01:00:17.434
Not if it means getting you killed!

1029
01:00:17.477 --> 01:00:18.644

Right here, right now. Oh, hell no!

Start it right now!

1033
01:00:27.112 --> 01:00:29.780
-That's why l don't believe in God.
-You what?


1034
01:00:29.865 --> 01:00:31.824
The hell with you, you old, broke-down man!

-Look at you.
-lt's all in the book.

-My mother hates your guts.

And she hates me, too!

1040
01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:45.379
That's why she sent me to you
in the first place!

Box ain't gonna kill nobody.

They just ignore you.

You're invisible. You don't belong.
You ever get that feeling?

Yeah, since l got here to Red Hook.

All this corny yakking about God
drives me nuts.

My grandfather's a bully and he's got God.

The Bloods run everything
and jack people's stuff


1091
01:03:27.709 --> 01:03:29.043
and they had God.

1092
01:03:29.127 --> 01:03:31.086
And these white people
in these nice houses,


1093
01:03:31.129 --> 01:03:32.379
they don't want us around.

1094

And they have their God.

And you loopy as Froot Loops
and you got God, too.

Let me ask you.

01:03:37.802 --> 01:03:41.138
Why does everybody want to go to heaven,
but nobody wants to die?


1098
01:03:41.222 --> 01:03:42.514
Very good question.

1099
01:03:42.599 --> 01:03:43.640
Didn't mean that!

1100
01:03:43.683 --> 01:03:44.683
lf you jump, Chazz,

1101
01:03:44.768 --> 01:03:46.977
God isn't going to catch you,
is what l meant!


1102
01:03:47.062 --> 01:03:48.771
And you better not
try it, you crazy girl.

1103
01:03:48.813 --> 01:03:52.107
l feel bad for you, Flik.
You got nothing to believe in.


1104
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:53.734
You're headed straight to hell!

1105
01:03:53.818 --> 01:03:56.487
No, l'm not. l haven't done anything wrong!

1106
01:03:56.571 --> 01:03:59.490
l'll hate you, if you jump!
l swear, l will hate you forever!


1107
01:03:59.699 --> 01:04:01.241
That's why l don't believe in God!

1108
01:04:01.326 --> 01:04:02.951
He lets too much bad stuff happen!

1109
01:04:02.994 --> 01:04:05.496
lt doesn't matter. 
God believes in you.

1110
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.039
Chazz!

1111
01:04:09.834 --> 01:04:13.003
Psych yo' mind, Frankenstein,
saw yo' face on Channel 9,


1112
01:04:13.088 --> 01:04:15.089
make your black booty shine!

1113
01:04:15.173 --> 01:04:16.673
Heh! Heh! Heh!

1114
01:04:16.758 --> 01:04:18.175
Stupid!

1115
01:04:18.301 --> 01:04:20.010
(LAUGHlNG)

1116
01:04:20.136 --> 01:04:21.428
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1117
01:04:22.722 --> 01:04:25.432
Heard through the Red Hook grapevine
about Flik and Box.


1118
01:04:25.517 --> 01:04:26.517
Mmm.

1119
01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:28.477
Talk about a Judas.

1120
01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.146
Well, that is not gonna happen again.

1121
01:04:31.356 --> 01:04:32.940
l'm reining Flik in.

1122
01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:35.275
He's on a short, short leash.

1123
01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.611
l'll have him so
busy running back and forth

1124
01:04:37.695 --> 01:04:39.863
between Sunday school
and working at over at Lil' Heaven,


1125
01:04:39.948 --> 01:04:41.240
he's gonna be dizzy.

1126
01:04:41.324 --> 01:04:43.200
Flik is fine.

1127
01:04:43.243 --> 01:04:45.786
He's the best boy
Chazz has ever met around here.


1128
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:47.871
The boy needs God in his life.

1129
01:04:47.956 --> 01:04:50.666
He's a 1 3-year-old boy, Enoch.

1130
01:04:50.708 --> 01:04:53.502
They'll be trading spit before you know it.

1131
01:04:53.545 --> 01:04:56.672
Now, you can call it courting if you want,
but who you fooling?


1132
01:04:56.714 --> 01:05:00.008
You ain't got to tell me about the dangers
of these young people courting.


1133
01:05:00.051 --> 01:05:01.593
l raised two.

1134
01:05:03.471 --> 01:05:06.140
When you first come here from down South,

1135
01:05:06.224 --> 01:05:08.308
after your wife died,

1136
01:05:08.393 --> 01:05:11.228
how come your daughter never
come up with you?


1137
01:05:11.271 --> 01:05:12.896
She's not saved.

1138
01:05:13.648 --> 01:05:16.525
l pray for her every day and night.

1139
01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:21.613
My big girl, Angel, she was my first.

1140
01:05:22.073 --> 01:05:25.033
Raised her in the Lord's light
from the word go.


1141
01:05:25.493 --> 01:05:28.078
Before l could turn my head around,
she got out here on Centre Mall,


1142
01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:30.664
got turned out
and came home with that AlDS.


1143
01:05:30.748 --> 01:05:32.416
That's not your fault, Shirley.

1144
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.335
Oh, yes, it is.

1145
01:05:35.837 --> 01:05:38.922
Oh, we talk a good game, you know?

1146
01:05:38.965 --> 01:05:40.507
Our generation,

1147
01:05:41.009 --> 01:05:43.343
about the good old days
when we was young.


1148
01:05:43.428 --> 01:05:44.428
(ENOCH CHUCKLlNG)

1149
01:05:45.263 --> 01:05:47.764
About the days when you could
spank a young'un


1150
01:05:47.849 --> 01:05:50.017
and tell them something once
and they did it.


1151
01:05:50.935 --> 01:05:53.520
And how we grew up
walking the straight and narrow,


1152
01:05:53.605 --> 01:05:58.400
picking cotton, shining shoes
and selling newspapers.


1153
01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:02.529
And nobody wore their pants low
and their dresses high.


1154
01:06:02.614 --> 01:06:06.283
And there weren't no sissies around
or whatever you call them.


1155
01:06:06.367 --> 01:06:08.619
Like our world was so perfect.

1156
01:06:09.454 --> 01:06:10.829
lt's a lie.

1157
01:06:11.956 --> 01:06:15.709
lf you and l grew up today
watching the TV 24/7,


1158
01:06:15.793 --> 01:06:18.295
we'd be foolish as these young people, too.

1159
01:06:18.338 --> 01:06:19.671
More so.

1160
01:06:20.131 --> 01:06:22.799
Their morals and their values are low.

1161
01:06:23.426 --> 01:06:25.928
You're a good man, Enoch Rouse.

1162
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:28.805
l been watching you a long time.

1163
01:06:28.848 --> 01:06:30.265
You're suffering and lonely,

1164
01:06:30.308 --> 01:06:33.769
'cause the world has changed
and passed you by.


1165
01:06:36.022 --> 01:06:37.564
But God hasn't.

1166
01:06:40.318 --> 01:06:42.945
We prayed for a black president
to deliver us,


1167
01:06:42.987 --> 01:06:44.821
and we got our wish.

1168
01:06:44.906 --> 01:06:48.492
l see our young people
same as they was before,


1169
01:06:48.534 --> 01:06:51.912
only now they can say,
"l, too, can be president."


1170
01:06:52.622 --> 01:06:54.289
No.

1171
01:06:54.666 --> 01:06:57.167
l'm done with that dream.

1172
01:06:57.210 --> 01:07:00.796
Not much has changed,
that's the God's truth.


1173
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.424
The rich keep getting super-rich,
poor get super-poor.


1174
01:07:04.509 --> 01:07:06.760
Don't matter what color they are.

1175
01:07:06.844 --> 01:07:09.012
Poor is on the
bottom rung the world over.

1176
01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.514
But God,

1177
01:07:10.556 --> 01:07:12.849
God is on the highest rung.

1178
01:07:12.934 --> 01:07:16.270
Wake up. Your grandson needs you.

1179
01:07:19.065 --> 01:07:21.984
l'm giving him God. 
That's enough.

1180
01:07:22.026 --> 01:07:24.820
l prayed for my Angel
till my knees wore out.

1181
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:27.531
Took her to Lil' 
Heaven every Sunday.

1182
01:07:27.573 --> 01:07:29.866
But the Hook got her and she died.

1183
01:07:29.951 --> 01:07:32.869
So this time,
l ain't just praying for my Chazz.


1184
01:07:32.912 --> 01:07:35.372
l'm watching her school,
her teachers, her friends,


1185
01:07:35.456 --> 01:07:37.291
her Facebook, her Twitter.

1186
01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:40.460
Ain't nothing gonna slip past me.

1187
01:07:40.545 --> 01:07:42.796
l ain't pawning off
my responsibility as a parent


1188
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.673
and saying, "She's in God's hands."

1189
01:07:44.716 --> 01:07:46.758
She's in my two loving hands.

1190
01:07:46.884 --> 01:07:50.178
And with God's help,
l will raise this one right.


1191
01:07:50.221 --> 01:07:53.932
By being honest,
and telling her when l ain't sure.


1192
01:07:54.017 --> 01:07:55.892
And listening.

1193
01:07:55.935 --> 01:07:57.894
l ain't preaching, l'm teaching.

1194
01:07:57.937 --> 01:08:00.564
l'm thinking that's the only way,

1195
01:08:00.648 --> 01:08:02.524
the only way,

1196
01:08:03.359 --> 01:08:05.610
she's gonna be safe and sound.

1197
01:08:06.571 --> 01:08:08.155
And you, Enoch,

1198
01:08:08.865 --> 01:08:10.991
you ought to do the same.

1199
01:08:11.075 --> 01:08:12.909
Because Flik needs a man.

1200
01:08:12.952 --> 01:08:15.454
Not a Bishop, not
a Bible, but a man.

1201
01:08:15.538 --> 01:08:18.582
And when the good man teaches,
the Bible will preach itself.


1202
01:08:25.381 --> 01:08:27.341
The Bible worked for my father.

1203
01:08:27.425 --> 01:08:29.217
The world is changed.

1204
01:08:30.094 --> 01:08:33.472
l've heard you preach
about your late father many times.


1205
01:08:34.015 --> 01:08:36.808
About how he pulled himself up
by his bootstraps


1206
01:08:36.893 --> 01:08:38.935
like Booker T. Washington.

1207
01:08:39.687 --> 01:08:40.771
How would he feel

1208
01:08:40.855 --> 01:08:44.149
about the way we are handling
what we have right here?


1209
01:08:44.233 --> 01:08:45.233
Hmm.

1210
01:08:46.778 --> 01:08:48.695
Shirley, the truth is,

1211
01:08:51.491 --> 01:08:55.369
my father never loved me.

1212
01:09:55.346 --> 01:09:56.972
l'll never do that again.

1213
01:09:57.014 --> 01:09:59.141
-You hate me.
-That's not true.


1214
01:09:59.183 --> 01:10:00.434
You hate Box?

1215
01:10:00.518 --> 01:10:02.102
l don't hate any of God's children.

1216
01:10:02.353 --> 01:10:03.854
Box said he'd kill you!

1217
01:10:03.896 --> 01:10:06.064
Box ain't killing nobody.

1218
01:10:06.774 --> 01:10:08.733
You know, you worry too much.

1219
01:10:09.694 --> 01:10:12.487
And that's what happens
when you don't put God first.


1220
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:14.656
How do you know God's real?

1221
01:10:15.032 --> 01:10:18.201
Forgiveness, redemption.
Turning the other cheek.


1222
01:10:18.286 --> 01:10:19.911
All them things.

1223
01:10:20.788 --> 01:10:23.373
You can't see God's purpose.

1224
01:10:23.416 --> 01:10:26.793
But believing in what you don't see
gives you power.


1225
01:10:26.878 --> 01:10:28.795
Otherwise, you can't be free.

1226
01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.338
Are you free?

1227
01:10:36.304 --> 01:10:38.597
lf you had a window

1228
01:10:39.265 --> 01:10:41.892
that you could look out
and see whatever you wanted,


1229
01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:44.936
what would you see?

1230
01:10:45.021 --> 01:10:48.565
l would like to be looking
out my own window in Atlanta.


1231
01:10:49.567 --> 01:10:52.527
My green grass and my big trees.

1232
01:10:54.947 --> 01:10:58.241
l'd be looking at
just what l'm looking at now.


1233
01:11:01.037 --> 01:11:03.580
Everything is made to God's purpose.

1234
01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.249
The Statue of Liberty, the East River,

1235
01:11:06.292 --> 01:11:07.542
the sky.

1236
01:11:08.419 --> 01:11:11.505
There isn't anything
the good Lord has made someplace else


1237
01:11:11.589 --> 01:11:13.924
that you can't find right here.

1238
01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.678
l've seen everything l've ever wanted to see.

1239
01:11:19.055 --> 01:11:20.430
Except for one thing.

1240
01:11:20.473 --> 01:11:21.932
What's that?

1241
01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.142
Seeing you kayaking.

1242
01:11:24.227 --> 01:11:25.435
What's kayaking?

1243
01:11:25.478 --> 01:11:26.728
Kayaking?

1244
01:11:26.771 --> 01:11:30.649
lt's taking a small kayak
into the water off the Valentino Pier.


1245
01:11:30.733 --> 01:11:32.108
You can do that in Red Hook?

1246
01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:34.569
You can do whatever you want here.

1247
01:11:34.779 --> 01:11:36.446
Can l bring Chazz?

1248
01:11:36.489 --> 01:11:38.156
Of course you can.

1249
01:11:39.951 --> 01:11:43.787
l think that deserves
a little bit more of your sweet things.


1250
01:11:46.624 --> 01:11:48.291
Not too much now.

1251
01:11:48.334 --> 01:11:50.710
And a smile. There you go.
