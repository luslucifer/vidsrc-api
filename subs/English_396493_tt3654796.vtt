00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:09.653
Oh, fuck.

2
00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:16.860
Holy shit.

3
00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:28.406
Fuck no.

4
00:02:25.663 --> 00:02:26.764
Hello?

5
00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:32.169
Hey, man.

6
00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:34.372
Hey, you okay?
You look troubled.


7
00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:39.377
Oh, yeah, sorry.
It's just, um, you should come see this.


8
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.944
Uh...

9
00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:42.380
What's going on, buddy?

10
00:02:42.413 --> 00:02:47.117
Remember I told you
I was getting those calls,


11
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.787
and I had that DVD sent to me?

12
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.355
I know.

13
00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.524
It's happening again?

14
00:02:53.557 --> 00:02:55.326
Yeah.

15
00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.728
- Oh, my god.
- I thought that was over, but...


16
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.163
I just had a package
outside, and...


17
00:03:00.197 --> 00:03:01.499
- Just now?
- Yeah.


18
00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:03.534
That was in there.

19
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:15.178
This person sent you
a stuffed baby wolf?


20
00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:17.681
I mean, I guess.

21
00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:19.383
It doesn't make any sense.

22
00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:22.953
There was also
this DVD that was in it.


23
00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:28.826
Dave, this is your...

24
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.161
That's your home.

25
00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:32.095
Dave.

26
00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.831
Yeah, I know, I know.

27
00:03:33.864 --> 00:03:35.032
This is serious.

28
00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:37.935
Whoever shot this,
they shot it last night.


29
00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:43.206
And that's me last night.

30
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.142
We have to
call the police.


31
00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:47.277
- You need to call the police. This is serious.
- No, no.


32
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:50.180
No, I already called
the police the last time,


33
00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:52.182
and nothing happened, okay?

34
00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:53.283
They said they...

35
00:03:53.317 --> 00:03:54.752
Well, that's unconscionable.

36
00:03:54.785 --> 00:03:56.487
- That's unconscionable.
- No, they even sent a patrol car.


37
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.622
- That's unconscionable.
- Nothing has actually happened.


38
00:03:58.656 --> 00:03:59.757
Where's your gun?

39
00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:02.526
Are you serious?

40
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.294
- Well, you need...
- I don't own a gun.


41
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:06.497
- You're gonna need something.
- That's not necessary.


42
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.899
- It's not necessary.
- Dave, I don't think you're taking this seriously enough.


43
00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:10.968
I'm sorry, I kinda just
ambushed you, uh...


44
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.102
No, it's okay man.

45
00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:13.571
- It's good. It's good.
- No. No, uh...


46
00:04:13.604 --> 00:04:14.705
Do you want a beer?

47
00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:15.939
- I would love one.
- Yeah?


48
00:04:15.973 --> 00:04:16.807
- Thank you.
- Yeah.


49
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.009
I think I need some alcohol.

50
00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.378
- Okay.
- Okay, great.


51
00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:23.447
It's crazy, Dave.

52
00:04:24.715 --> 00:04:26.016
It's fine. It's fine.

53
00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:27.184
It's okay. It's okay.

54
00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:32.122
Hi, sweet boy.

55
00:04:33.824 --> 00:04:34.958
Hello.

56
00:04:44.134 --> 00:04:46.937
So, what is going on with you?

57
00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.641
Are you serious?
What's going on with me?


58
00:04:51.308 --> 00:04:52.510
Yeah.

59
00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:54.545
God damn, you're awesome.

60
00:04:54.578 --> 00:04:58.582
I mean, here you are, dealing with
this potential stalker situation,


61
00:04:58.616 --> 00:05:01.819
and you're concerned
with me and my feelings?


62
00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:03.320
Mmm-hmm.

63
00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:04.588
Fuckin' love you, man.

64
00:05:04.622 --> 00:05:05.689
Aw.

65
00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:07.190
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


66
00:05:08.526 --> 00:05:09.827
Mm.

67
00:05:16.266 --> 00:05:18.536
This is great, isn't it?

68
00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.004
- Yeah.
- Two guys just hanging out,


69
00:05:21.038 --> 00:05:22.906
throwing back
a couple of cold ones.


70
00:05:24.742 --> 00:05:27.645
Really wish I didn't have to say
what I have to say to you tonight.


71
00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:32.716
Oh. What's that?

72
00:05:37.955 --> 00:05:39.523
I'm worried about us.

73
00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:42.760
Mm.

74
00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:45.796
- Oh, uh, you are?
- Aren't you?


75
00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:49.600
Uh, us, we're good.
We're friends. We...


76
00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:52.269
We hang out
sometimes. We're...


77
00:05:52.302 --> 00:05:53.937
Come on, Dave.

78
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:56.707
You and I both know there's a
lot more at stake than that.


79
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.142
- Okay...
- Meeting at the same coffee shop,


80
00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:00.778
in the same Tuesday morning,

81
00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:04.181
reading the same exact
edition of Infinite Jest?


82
00:06:04.214 --> 00:06:05.082
Hmm.

83
00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.984
And if that wasn't kismet,

84
00:06:07.017 --> 00:06:09.152
if we weren't meant to
be best friends or soulmates,


85
00:06:09.186 --> 00:06:11.589
and started out so hot and heavy like that,
and then...


86
00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.458
We turned into this...

87
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.661
Well, it's disappointing.

88
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.231
And I can't help
but think if we...


89
00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:24.401
If we aren't
headed for greatness,


90
00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:27.370
then maybe we just
end it right here...


91
00:06:28.572 --> 00:06:29.873
tonight.

92
00:06:29.907 --> 00:06:32.009
Okay, I don't
think that's necessary.


93
00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:34.578
Dave, if I ask you a question,
would you answer me honestly?


94
00:06:35.646 --> 00:06:37.147
Yeah, of course.

95
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.318
Do you ever think about how...

96
00:06:42.953 --> 00:06:45.122
We met right
around the same time


97
00:06:45.155 --> 00:06:46.990
you received your
first DVD in the mail?


98
00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.430
You just thought
about it, didn't you?


99
00:06:54.031 --> 00:06:54.965
I didn't.

100
00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.166
Dave, you just
thought about it.


101
00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.300
I didn't, I swear.

102
00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.570
Dave, listen to me.
It's okay, okay?


103
00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:01.672
Everything that's about to
happen to you here tonight


104
00:07:01.705 --> 00:07:03.541
is okay, and it's
not your fault.


105
00:07:03.574 --> 00:07:04.875
You understand me?

106
00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:05.976
- No, I don't understand...
- Okay, now, listen.


107
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.546
There's a camera
inside this wolf, okay?


108
00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:11.615
Now I've been filming you in some way,
shape, or form since the day we met.


109
00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:13.551
This is baby Peach Fuzz.
Say hi.


110
00:07:13.584 --> 00:07:15.553
I was gonna record
our entire relationship


111
00:07:15.586 --> 00:07:17.821
and commemorate it with
a beautiful 80-minute film,


112
00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:19.222
and you deserve that.

113
00:07:19.256 --> 00:07:22.726
You deserve it because
you're a beautiful person,


114
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.428
and I want to give that
to you so bad, but...


115
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.331
I can't.

116
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:31.368
'Cause ever since
I turned 40,


117
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:33.937
I don't know what's happening to me, Dave.
I just...


118
00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:36.574
I've lost my inspiration,
I have no joy,


119
00:07:36.607 --> 00:07:38.341
and my work...

120
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:40.210
I don't even know
if I can do this anymore.


121
00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:50.353
God damn it.

122
00:07:56.193 --> 00:07:57.394
What's happening to me?

123
00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:43.974
*

124
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:15.639
*

125
00:09:17.607 --> 00:09:19.209
Hi, I'm Sara.

126
00:09:19.242 --> 00:09:21.111
Welcome to Encounters.

127
00:09:21.144 --> 00:09:25.415
The show where I look behind the
strange world of online personal ads


128
00:09:25.448 --> 00:09:28.752
to try to uncover
the humanity underneath.


129
00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:30.087
- Hey, Wade.
- Hey.


130
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.188
I'm Sara.

131
00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:32.489
Hey, Sara, how you doin'?

132
00:09:32.522 --> 00:09:35.192
I hope you don't mind
I brought my camera.


133
00:09:35.225 --> 00:09:38.328
If you don't mind,
Marilyn Monroe already lives in the wall.


134
00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:39.897
Oh, yeah.

135
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.564
There she is.

136
00:09:41.598 --> 00:09:44.301
So you were trying to make
your pottery earlier.


137
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.136
- Yeah.
- You were telling me about it.


138
00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:49.339
Who are these people
who write these ads?


139
00:09:49.372 --> 00:09:51.141
What is their story?

140
00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:53.543
This place has
a cold energy to it.


141
00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:54.712
Mmm-hmm.

142
00:09:54.745 --> 00:09:57.080
Most of the spirit pots
that I build


143
00:09:57.114 --> 00:10:00.718
are to deflect
that cold energy.


144
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:02.585
This is my little Jaws 2.

145
00:10:02.619 --> 00:10:04.688
He's a little shark.

146
00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:06.189
- Yeah, it does look good.
- It does.


147
00:10:06.223 --> 00:10:08.025
Little jaws.

148
00:10:08.058 --> 00:10:10.427
Maybe we're all a little bit weirder
than we give ourselves credit for.


149
00:10:14.832 --> 00:10:16.967
- May I come in?
- Yeah, come in.


150
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.937
What did you... What were you
looking for when you posted your ad?


151
00:10:20.337 --> 00:10:21.338
You know...

152
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.342
You know, life is lonely.

153
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.010
- Yeah.
- It's nice to have someone to talk to.


154
00:10:35.252 --> 00:10:37.687
So subscribe
and join me on this journey.


155
00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.557
- Hey.
- Hi, welcome.


156
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.926
You never know who you
might meet on the next...


157
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.127
- Is it okay?
- Yeah.


158
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:45.428
...Encounters.

159
00:10:52.202 --> 00:10:55.605
* Hush, little baby
Don't say a word *


160
00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:59.176
* Mama's going to buy you
A mockingbird *


161
00:10:59.209 --> 00:11:00.377
No.

162
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.513
* If that mockingbird
Won't sing... *


163
00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:05.415
Nine views.

164
00:11:05.448 --> 00:11:06.549
Awesome.

165
00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:12.089
Hey, this is Sara.

166
00:11:12.122 --> 00:11:13.690
Welcome to Encounters,

167
00:11:13.723 --> 00:11:16.293
the web series that
nobody gives a shit about,


168
00:11:16.326 --> 00:11:19.797
and I am starting to realize
why nobody is watching.


169
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.399
It's because it sucks.

170
00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.601
* Buy you a looking...

171
00:11:24.634 --> 00:11:28.505
* If that billy goat
Don't pull... *


172
00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:30.974
I think I might be
deeply untalented.


173
00:11:34.812 --> 00:11:36.579
Aw, man.

174
00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:39.950
I thought I had a talent for bringing
out something weird and special


175
00:11:39.983 --> 00:11:43.386
and taboo and secret
in people,


176
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.923
that there was a loneliness
that I could detect,


177
00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:47.891
that I really empathized with.

178
00:11:47.925 --> 00:11:52.162
And I... I see glimpses of it sometimes,
and it's so exciting.


179
00:11:52.195 --> 00:11:54.497
And I'm close.
I can feel it,


180
00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:56.766
but I never follow through
in the right way,


181
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.169
and I'm tired of trying,
and I'm tired of failing.


182
00:11:59.202 --> 00:12:00.370
It is humiliating.

183
00:12:01.604 --> 00:12:03.807
I never expected to
make money doing this,


184
00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:07.010
but I thought at least I would be
able to reach some other weirdos


185
00:12:07.044 --> 00:12:08.711
and make something
special for them.


186
00:12:12.582 --> 00:12:14.217
So I'm Sara.

187
00:12:14.251 --> 00:12:15.919
Welcome to Encounters.

188
00:12:15.953 --> 00:12:19.957
This is our finale,
the closing episode of the entire season.


189
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.260
Join me as we encounter...
my failure.


190
00:12:24.227 --> 00:12:25.628
I hope you enjoy it.

191
00:12:28.065 --> 00:12:29.933
Hey. Sorry about last night.

192
00:12:29.967 --> 00:12:31.434
I got a little bit dramatic,

193
00:12:31.468 --> 00:12:32.836
but I'm feeling
a lot better now.


194
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.171
I've had my coffee,

195
00:12:34.204 --> 00:12:36.639
and... I found this.

196
00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.080
"Looking for videographer.

197
00:12:43.113 --> 00:12:44.581
$1000 for the day.

198
00:12:44.614 --> 00:12:46.884
Honesty and
emotional bravery a must.


199
00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:49.752
Fans of Interview with
the Vampire a plus.


200
00:12:49.786 --> 00:12:51.721
Let's go deep. Together."

201
00:12:54.557 --> 00:12:55.658
Interesting.

202
00:13:15.145 --> 00:13:16.313
Oh.

203
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.062
Ah...

204
00:13:34.531 --> 00:13:35.632
Fuck it.

205
00:13:49.312 --> 00:13:50.780
What?

206
00:14:09.066 --> 00:14:10.200
Here we are...

207
00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:12.135
in the woods.

208
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.806
I've been driving
three hours now.


209
00:14:23.646 --> 00:14:26.149
This is a lot more off road
than I had anticipated.


210
00:14:31.054 --> 00:14:33.423
745.

211
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:41.864
Okay.

212
00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:44.234
Hey.

213
00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:45.368
Welcome to Encounters.

214
00:14:45.402 --> 00:14:48.171
I'm Sara. This is
episode 10 of 10.


215
00:14:48.205 --> 00:14:50.807
And normally,
this is where I tell you


216
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.277
that I'm gonna go see John,
a mid-level manager at Walgreens,


217
00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:57.180
and that we're gonna work through
his mommy issues through...


218
00:14:57.214 --> 00:14:59.216
I don't know,
synchronized swimming or some shit,


219
00:14:59.249 --> 00:15:01.418
but I don't have that today.

220
00:15:01.451 --> 00:15:03.086
I know very little
about this guy.


221
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.389
He's been ghosting me
since he sent me his address,


222
00:15:07.624 --> 00:15:10.560
and I have no idea
what I'm stepping into.


223
00:15:10.593 --> 00:15:14.764
Normally, this is not a situation
I would allow myself to get into,


224
00:15:14.797 --> 00:15:18.035
but maybe that's why this show
has been sucking so much.


225
00:15:18.068 --> 00:15:19.402
So let's see what happens.

226
00:15:39.356 --> 00:15:40.357
Hello?

227
00:16:01.744 --> 00:16:02.912
Hello, I'm Sara.

228
00:16:05.948 --> 00:16:06.916
Oh.

229
00:16:07.584 --> 00:16:08.585
Sorry.

230
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.429
Hi.

231
00:16:19.462 --> 00:16:20.597
Green smoothie?

232
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:22.465
Okay.

233
00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.402
Very healthy.

234
00:16:27.804 --> 00:16:29.872
Kale, four
frozen strawberries,


235
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:34.111
one banana, one heaping tablespoon
of non-fat plain Greek yogurt,


236
00:16:34.144 --> 00:16:37.447
two pinches spirulina and
one pinch of cinnamon.


237
00:16:38.148 --> 00:16:39.082
Thank you.

238
00:16:39.116 --> 00:16:40.383
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


239
00:16:42.719 --> 00:16:44.221
It's good.

240
00:16:44.254 --> 00:16:45.555
It's also poisoned.

241
00:16:46.523 --> 00:16:47.790
Obviously I'm kidding.

242
00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:49.792
I'm Aaron.

243
00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:50.793
Sara.

244
00:16:54.063 --> 00:16:55.465
Wow. That's your real name.

245
00:16:55.998 --> 00:16:56.999
Yeah.

246
00:16:58.601 --> 00:16:59.636
Yeah, I can tell.

247
00:17:00.637 --> 00:17:01.871
Thanks for that.

248
00:17:01.904 --> 00:17:02.972
You're welcome.

249
00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:07.310
Can we start with a hug?

250
00:17:07.344 --> 00:17:08.245
Okay.

251
00:17:10.647 --> 00:17:11.814
Mm.

252
00:17:11.848 --> 00:17:14.617
I like that you came in
already filming.


253
00:17:14.651 --> 00:17:17.019
Yeah, I want you
to get your money's worth.


254
00:17:17.053 --> 00:17:19.622
Yeah. You know, people
don't really believe in that.


255
00:17:19.656 --> 00:17:21.791
You got to keep the camera on
if you wanna keep the magic.


256
00:17:21.824 --> 00:17:22.959
I mean... You know.

257
00:17:22.992 --> 00:17:25.728
You and I kinda have a thing.
I like that.


258
00:17:25.762 --> 00:17:29.532
That's a nice camera, by the way.
Are you a filmmaker by trade?


259
00:17:29.566 --> 00:17:32.769
I shoot wedding videos
to make money.


260
00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:36.072
I'm actually applying to grad school
right now. I'm trying to save up.


261
00:17:36.105 --> 00:17:37.374
Mm. You don't do
anything else?


262
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.209
No.

263
00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.279
Cool.

264
00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:43.980
What about you?
What's your story?


265
00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.116
My story, um...

266
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.720
I am what is commonly
known as a serial killer.


267
00:17:50.753 --> 00:17:53.190
Um, I don't love
that nomenclature.


268
00:17:53.223 --> 00:17:55.124
I sort of consider
myself a murderer,


269
00:17:55.158 --> 00:18:00.763
but, uh, my numbers are such that I'm
now classified as a serial killer.


270
00:18:00.797 --> 00:18:02.699
- Serial killer?
- Yes, I am a killer.


271
00:18:02.732 --> 00:18:04.534
I have killed 39 people.

272
00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:06.169
This is something
that I love to do.


273
00:18:06.203 --> 00:18:07.404
It's the greatest job
in the world.


274
00:18:07.437 --> 00:18:08.705
That's what I'm built to do.

275
00:18:08.738 --> 00:18:11.140
Um, but I'm also
turning 40 this year,


276
00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:14.211
which is like, grays in the beards,
a lot of stuff happening,


277
00:18:14.244 --> 00:18:16.546
and it's making me
a little mid-lifey,


278
00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:19.716
and it's kind of set me
into a little bit of a spiral.


279
00:18:19.749 --> 00:18:24.321
And I think I fucked
myself in the head.


280
00:18:24.354 --> 00:18:26.756
I don't trust
my instincts anymore,


281
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:30.793
and I feel like I may have
lost what made me great.


282
00:18:30.827 --> 00:18:33.696
There was a time
in my life when


283
00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.164
I would meet
a man at a bar


284
00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:37.767
and I would take him outside
and lay him on the floor,


285
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.137
and I would put a knife
in his chest and cut him open.


286
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.306
And... open his insides,

287
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.743
and the universe would reveal itself to me,
and it was beautiful.


288
00:18:46.776 --> 00:18:51.348
And I felt part of every time and every
place that had ever existed. It...


289
00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:53.816
It was my religion.

290
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.585
But now, it...

291
00:18:58.321 --> 00:18:59.922
It's like a job.

292
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:05.194
And it makes me
really fucking sad.


293
00:19:06.195 --> 00:19:08.498
And I don't wanna get emotional,

294
00:19:08.531 --> 00:19:11.268
but, um, I'm
having a hard time.


295
00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:14.571
But then,

296
00:19:14.604 --> 00:19:17.340
I read an article about
the great Francis Ford Coppola.


297
00:19:17.374 --> 00:19:20.943
He said something that
blew my fucking mind.


298
00:19:20.977 --> 00:19:25.014
He said, "I've not made an original
film since The Conversation in 1974.


299
00:19:25.047 --> 00:19:26.816
I am not sure
I'm capable of it,


300
00:19:26.849 --> 00:19:29.586
but I really wanna
keep trying."


301
00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:32.154
And then it hit me
like a sack of bricks.


302
00:19:32.188 --> 00:19:35.758
Here's a man who's in the middle
of his artistic decline...


303
00:19:35.792 --> 00:19:38.795
Is he running from it?
No, he's embracing it.


304
00:19:38.828 --> 00:19:40.297
So, I'm like...

305
00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.765
What am I doing,
trying to make the films that I used to make?


306
00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:45.502
What if I embrace
where I'm at right now?


307
00:19:45.535 --> 00:19:48.371
What if I make a documentary?

308
00:19:48.405 --> 00:19:50.373
And this is
where you come in.


309
00:19:50.407 --> 00:19:54.677
A documentary about the world's
most prolific serial killer


310
00:19:54.711 --> 00:19:56.946
that no one knows about.

311
00:19:56.979 --> 00:19:59.549
A documentary that
you and I make here,


312
00:19:59.849 --> 00:20:01.017
tonight.

313
00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:03.786
I mean, like,

314
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.955
I realize I'm throwing
a lot at you.


315
00:20:05.988 --> 00:20:08.425
You haven't even had the chance
to finish your green smoothie,


316
00:20:08.458 --> 00:20:10.026
so if you wanna bail,

317
00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:11.494
I completely understand.

318
00:20:11.528 --> 00:20:13.996
Take your money,
no hard feelings.


319
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.264
I understand.

320
00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:17.967
But if you don't...

321
00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:20.770
and I really hope you don't...

322
00:20:23.205 --> 00:20:25.542
I can offer you two things.

323
00:20:25.575 --> 00:20:28.945
Firstly, I won't kill you
over the next 24 hours.


324
00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:31.013
That would be
counter-productive.


325
00:20:31.047 --> 00:20:33.182
And secondly,

326
00:20:33.215 --> 00:20:37.186
I will give you the deepest
personal access into my soul


327
00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:38.588
that you could
possibly imagine.


328
00:20:38.621 --> 00:20:40.323
I will rip myself open

329
00:20:40.357 --> 00:20:44.026
and let you see
every last inch of me.


330
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.597
And together, I believe
we will make magic.


331
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.801
But you gotta be into it.

332
00:20:52.635 --> 00:20:53.870
I'm into it.

333
00:20:56.105 --> 00:20:59.208
Are you just saying you're into
it because you want a job?


334
00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:02.679
No, I've heard you out,
And I think this sounds great.


335
00:21:02.712 --> 00:21:03.780
Wanna do it?

336
00:21:03.813 --> 00:21:05.715
I don't hear any
passion in your voice.


337
00:21:09.586 --> 00:21:11.621
Aaron, I wanna make
this film with you.


338
00:21:16.626 --> 00:21:17.727
Hmm.

339
00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:25.602
What am I
looking at here?


340
00:21:26.436 --> 00:21:27.470
You'll see.

341
00:21:34.176 --> 00:21:35.445
Who's this guy?

342
00:21:36.045 --> 00:21:37.213
He's my friend.

343
00:21:44.854 --> 00:21:45.888
Is that you?

344
00:21:45.922 --> 00:21:47.524
Sara...

345
00:21:47.557 --> 00:21:49.992
all good things
to those who wait.


346
00:22:07.043 --> 00:22:10.613
* I may look
Like a big, bad wolf *


347
00:22:13.049 --> 00:22:16.318
* But I'm as friendly
As a rabbit *


348
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:24.727
Oh.

349
00:22:53.523 --> 00:22:54.390
Shit.

350
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.606
So...

351
00:23:15.011 --> 00:23:15.978
What do you think?

352
00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:22.985
I think it's interesting.

353
00:23:23.019 --> 00:23:23.953
Mmm-hmm.

354
00:23:23.986 --> 00:23:25.121
Did it scare you?

355
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.361
Did you want it to scare me?

356
00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:35.397
Hmm.

357
00:23:35.431 --> 00:23:36.465
I'll be right back.

358
00:23:46.543 --> 00:23:47.644
Fuck.

359
00:23:50.613 --> 00:23:52.048
What the fuck?

360
00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:06.162
So.

361
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.566
I was thinking
upstairs that...


362
00:24:11.668 --> 00:24:13.335
When men are
in the locker room,


363
00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:16.405
they snap towels
at each other's genitals


364
00:24:16.438 --> 00:24:18.140
without any inhibitions.

365
00:24:18.174 --> 00:24:23.012
Uh,
when women try on clothes in changing rooms,


366
00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:25.447
there is no barrier
to their intimacy.


367
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:27.984
But with a man
and a woman,


368
00:24:28.017 --> 00:24:30.019
there is always a wall
between them.


369
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.322
And that wall is...

370
00:24:33.355 --> 00:24:35.524
"I wonder what
you look like naked."


371
00:24:36.826 --> 00:24:39.028
And if I'm being honest,

372
00:24:39.061 --> 00:24:40.997
that's something I've felt.

373
00:24:46.002 --> 00:24:48.170
And if we're gonna embark
on this journey together,


374
00:24:49.639 --> 00:24:51.874
we need to tear
that wall down.


375
00:24:51.908 --> 00:24:53.009
Do you agree?

376
00:24:53.042 --> 00:24:53.910
I agree.

377
00:25:05.988 --> 00:25:07.189
How do you feel?

378
00:25:10.059 --> 00:25:11.293
I'm good.

379
00:25:11.327 --> 00:25:12.361
You?

380
00:25:13.963 --> 00:25:17.133
I just think it's important
that there is a wall


381
00:25:17.867 --> 00:25:19.335
and a gender divide.

382
00:25:19.368 --> 00:25:22.038
This is a spiritual journey,
so we need to eradicate it.


383
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.107
I agree.

384
00:25:28.144 --> 00:25:29.178
Okay.

385
00:25:29.211 --> 00:25:30.279
Then we're good.

386
00:25:30.312 --> 00:25:31.413
Is it my turn?

387
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:34.684
I'm sorry?

388
00:25:34.717 --> 00:25:36.518
Um, can it be my turn now?

389
00:25:36.853 --> 00:25:37.787
Here.

390
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.656
Uh...

391
00:25:40.422 --> 00:25:41.490
You can sit down.

392
00:25:41.523 --> 00:25:43.225
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

393
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.598
You got your frame?

394
00:25:50.132 --> 00:25:51.600
Yeah. Yeah.

395
00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:20.396
Are we good?

396
00:26:25.534 --> 00:26:26.635
Yeah.

397
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.605
Okay.

398
00:26:29.638 --> 00:26:30.807
I'll be right back.

399
00:26:41.217 --> 00:26:43.385
Holy shit. Holy shit.
Holy shit.


400
00:26:46.588 --> 00:26:47.623
Okay.

401
00:26:48.657 --> 00:26:50.793
Okay.

402
00:26:50.827 --> 00:26:54.530
Sara, every red flag
you have has been raised.


403
00:26:54.563 --> 00:26:59.335
Um, he is highly unpredictable
and potentially dangerous,


404
00:26:59.368 --> 00:27:04.340
and you were not there for ten minutes
before his dick was in your face.


405
00:27:04.373 --> 00:27:07.576
Sara, you were not there for ten minutes
before his dick was in your face.


406
00:27:07.609 --> 00:27:10.279
He is everything you
ever wanted in a subject.


407
00:27:10.312 --> 00:27:11.881
You have to chase this.

408
00:27:11.914 --> 00:27:13.549
Sara, come on,
we're losing light.


409
00:27:13.582 --> 00:27:14.650
I'm coming.

410
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.258
I have to do this.

411
00:27:24.927 --> 00:27:27.897
I'm like 99.9% positive
he is not a killer.


412
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.833
but just in case,
because I'm not a total fucking idiot...


413
00:27:31.633 --> 00:27:32.568
Knife.

414
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.637
I'm coming.

415
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:36.773
One minute.

416
00:27:39.742 --> 00:27:41.944
Hey, I'm Sara.

417
00:27:41.978 --> 00:27:43.445
Welcome to Encounters.

418
00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.948
Here we fucking go.

419
00:27:57.626 --> 00:27:58.995
Are you ready to go?

420
00:27:59.028 --> 00:28:01.063
Wow. You're
a tough nut to crack.


421
00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:02.999
Mm...

422
00:28:03.032 --> 00:28:05.334
What's with your beard here?

423
00:28:05.367 --> 00:28:06.702
What... What do you mean?

424
00:28:06.735 --> 00:28:08.237
Right there.

425
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.774
Oh, this. That's just
my beard pattern.


426
00:28:11.808 --> 00:28:14.777
Some men have little patches.
This is one of my patches.


427
00:28:14.811 --> 00:28:16.712
Um, all right,
we should get going.


428
00:28:16.745 --> 00:28:17.746
We are losing light.

429
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.815
Okay.

430
00:28:25.321 --> 00:28:26.789
Aaron, come on.

431
00:28:26.823 --> 00:28:27.756
Really?

432
00:28:29.358 --> 00:28:31.027
All right.

433
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.461
I'll get you
at some point.


434
00:28:33.462 --> 00:28:34.931
We'll see about that.

435
00:28:36.265 --> 00:28:37.533
Where are you from?

436
00:28:45.707 --> 00:28:47.109
So where
did you grow up?


437
00:28:49.178 --> 00:28:51.981
What do you
think about my mask?


438
00:28:52.014 --> 00:28:55.351
As a passenger,
I'm not super excited about it.


439
00:28:55.384 --> 00:28:57.119
Can you see in that thing?

440
00:28:57.153 --> 00:28:58.720
Oh, now you're scared?

441
00:29:01.623 --> 00:29:03.926
Do you believe in God?

442
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.395
It could complicate
what you do for a living.


443
00:29:06.428 --> 00:29:09.031
You still haven't answered
my question about my mask.


444
00:29:10.466 --> 00:29:11.868
I think it's cute.

445
00:29:20.042 --> 00:29:21.143
Really?

446
00:29:21.577 --> 00:29:22.678
Sure.

447
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:24.046
You're a cute little wolf.

448
00:29:27.216 --> 00:29:29.919
What would you say
if I told you


449
00:29:29.952 --> 00:29:32.588
I'm a naughty wolf?

450
00:29:32.621 --> 00:29:35.457
I'd say that's very scary
coming from someone like you.


451
00:29:36.325 --> 00:29:37.693
Okay.

452
00:29:37.726 --> 00:29:40.196
Well, what if I told you that
at the end of this road,


453
00:29:40.229 --> 00:29:42.431
I was gonna
cut off your head


454
00:29:42.464 --> 00:29:43.966
and snugglefuck it?

455
00:29:52.774 --> 00:29:54.510
Did you have
any friends growing up?


456
00:29:54.543 --> 00:29:55.544
Uh-huh.

457
00:29:56.778 --> 00:29:58.147
Did you have
a best friend?


458
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:00.382
Sure.

459
00:30:03.352 --> 00:30:04.586
You think
your best friend...


460
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.989
You're asking a lot
of questions. Um...


461
00:30:07.589 --> 00:30:09.091
I'm sorry.

462
00:30:09.125 --> 00:30:11.427
I have a perfect, idyllic spot
picked out for this interview.


463
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.895
Can we just...

464
00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:14.997
Let's just save it. Okay?

465
00:30:15.797 --> 00:30:16.732
Okay.

466
00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:18.734
Okay.

467
00:30:18.767 --> 00:30:20.336
Thanks, Sara.

468
00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:21.370
You're gonna love it.

469
00:30:28.911 --> 00:30:30.612
Oh, this is really nice.

470
00:30:30.646 --> 00:30:33.115
No. No, no!

471
00:30:34.316 --> 00:30:35.551
Where's the water?

472
00:30:36.986 --> 00:30:38.420
Where's the fucking water?

473
00:30:38.454 --> 00:30:40.389
That's the water.

474
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:44.493
No, no, no. The raging river of water that
was here when I scouted it. It was...


475
00:30:44.526 --> 00:30:46.728
You know, I had
the whole shot planned.


476
00:30:46.762 --> 00:30:47.796
I was gonna be here,

477
00:30:47.829 --> 00:30:49.765
submerged in the water
up to my neck


478
00:30:49.798 --> 00:30:51.800
for the whole
Jesus metaphor


479
00:30:51.833 --> 00:30:55.237
and that's the...
I mean, and the... the bridge!


480
00:30:55.271 --> 00:30:57.406
That was the final scene.

481
00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:59.541
I was gonna jump off the bridge,
splash into the water,


482
00:30:59.575 --> 00:31:01.677
you cut to
something really cool,


483
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.180
I mean, that's the ending
of the scene. We...


484
00:31:04.213 --> 00:31:06.949
We don't even
have a scene.


485
00:31:06.983 --> 00:31:09.385
This is not...

486
00:31:09.952 --> 00:31:11.020
This is...

487
00:31:11.653 --> 00:31:14.356
This is... No. No, no!

488
00:31:14.923 --> 00:31:16.192
Aaron?

489
00:31:16.225 --> 00:31:18.594
Hold on. I'm gonna.
I gotta think about this.


490
00:31:25.534 --> 00:31:26.768
- Aaron.
- What!


491
00:31:28.971 --> 00:31:30.039
Coppola.

492
00:31:33.242 --> 00:31:34.143
Poppola?

493
00:31:34.943 --> 00:31:36.312
Coppola.

494
00:31:36.345 --> 00:31:38.514
Why are you
saying Coppola? What...


495
00:31:38.547 --> 00:31:39.515
Aaron.

496
00:31:40.249 --> 00:31:43.952
Francis Ford Coppola.

497
00:31:44.953 --> 00:31:46.155
What would he do?

498
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.528
Huh.

499
00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.835
That's really fuckin' smart.

500
00:32:08.377 --> 00:32:10.879
December 1978.

501
00:32:10.912 --> 00:32:13.349
It was the last days of disco.

502
00:32:13.382 --> 00:32:16.118
The Cold War was
heating up by the minute.


503
00:32:16.152 --> 00:32:18.220
But in a nondescript home,

504
00:32:18.254 --> 00:32:20.356
in a nondescript town...

505
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:22.924
Sorry, what are you
doing with your arms?


506
00:32:22.958 --> 00:32:26.962
This is, uh, well,
if the visual effects of the water's up here,


507
00:32:26.995 --> 00:32:28.997
this would be me
just sort of floating...


508
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:30.732
- Ah.
- ...with it. You know what I'm saying?


509
00:32:30.766 --> 00:32:32.834
- Yeah, I don't think...
- This one feels a little more real.


510
00:32:32.868 --> 00:32:34.536
What do you think?
Should we...


511
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:35.637
I don't think you need it.

512
00:32:35.671 --> 00:32:37.005
- We don't need it?
- No.


513
00:32:39.575 --> 00:32:41.943
Sorry, I got a little...
I got some sunblock in my eye.


514
00:32:42.744 --> 00:32:43.745
Mm.

515
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:50.586
Airplane.

516
00:32:50.619 --> 00:32:52.188
Wait. Let's wait
for the sound...


517
00:32:55.357 --> 00:32:56.792
It's a really slow airplane.

518
00:32:57.926 --> 00:32:59.295
How's the pony?

519
00:32:59.328 --> 00:33:00.829
- Beautiful.
- Yeah?


520
00:33:00.862 --> 00:33:02.631
- You sure?
- Yep.


521
00:33:02.664 --> 00:33:05.701
Would you mind coming up real quick
and just giving me a little fix?


522
00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:07.369
Um, yeah. Okay.

523
00:33:07.403 --> 00:33:10.005
Sorry. I don't want to get your shoes wet,
but I just wanna make sure it's right.


524
00:33:11.407 --> 00:33:13.041
- Okay.
- Yeah, come on up.


525
00:33:20.816 --> 00:33:21.783
Just tighten it.

526
00:33:23.352 --> 00:33:24.686
Oh, I didn't want
you to redo...


527
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.987
Oh, that's okay.
No problem.


528
00:33:26.021 --> 00:33:27.389
We'll do it. We'll just
do the whole thing.


529
00:33:32.994 --> 00:33:35.164
December 1978.

530
00:33:35.197 --> 00:33:37.433
It was the last days of disco.

531
00:33:37.466 --> 00:33:40.302
The Cold War was
just heating up,


532
00:33:40.336 --> 00:33:41.803
but in a small tow...

533
00:33:44.806 --> 00:33:46.242
Little bird right there.
Hold on.


534
00:33:48.244 --> 00:33:50.846
December 19...

535
00:33:53.048 --> 00:33:55.151
It's like a bad joke.

536
00:33:55.517 --> 00:33:56.585
Hey.

537
00:33:58.354 --> 00:34:00.722
One more.
Try it one more time.


538
00:34:00.756 --> 00:34:01.757
One more time.

539
00:34:03.225 --> 00:34:05.127
I want you to do it.

540
00:34:05.161 --> 00:34:06.728
I want you to do it!

541
00:34:06.762 --> 00:34:08.830
Hey! No!

542
00:34:08.864 --> 00:34:09.965
No!

543
00:34:09.998 --> 00:34:11.800
No! This is my movie...

544
00:34:14.203 --> 00:34:17.038
It was December 1978.

545
00:34:17.072 --> 00:34:19.208
It was the last days of disco.

546
00:34:19.241 --> 00:34:20.576
The Cold War was just...

547
00:34:20.609 --> 00:34:22.544
I'm getting a lot of shadow
on your face.


548
00:34:24.446 --> 00:34:25.814
You wanna retake this?

549
00:34:29.418 --> 00:34:30.519
Aaron?

550
00:34:38.627 --> 00:34:39.761
I'm gonna take a break.

551
00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:41.397
Okay.

552
00:34:45.033 --> 00:34:46.368
If you'll excuse me.

553
00:35:02.718 --> 00:35:03.652
Aaron?

554
00:35:08.624 --> 00:35:11.660
Okay, so it turns out Aaron
is a bit of a drama queen.


555
00:35:13.795 --> 00:35:17.032
I'm not sure if
he's used to collaboration.


556
00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:25.140
Aaron?

557
00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:44.426
This day
might be a wash.


558
00:35:47.263 --> 00:35:49.331
I'm just not...

559
00:35:50.866 --> 00:35:51.867
Aaron?

560
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.571
Aaron, is that you?

561
00:36:20.161 --> 00:36:21.029
Aaron?

562
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.841
Don't leave.

563
00:37:07.976 --> 00:37:09.010
I won't.

564
00:37:29.465 --> 00:37:30.566
Hey.

565
00:37:31.433 --> 00:37:33.602
Aaron's not talking anymore.

566
00:37:33.635 --> 00:37:36.538
He's kind of shut down
since his tantrum at the river.


567
00:37:36.572 --> 00:37:38.239
And I don't know
if you can hear it,


568
00:37:38.273 --> 00:37:41.977
but he's been blasting the same shit
'90s jam band song on loop


569
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.479
for the past hour.

570
00:37:46.247 --> 00:37:48.016
He's so vulnerable right now,

571
00:37:48.049 --> 00:37:51.353
and I know the decent thing to
do is just give him some space,


572
00:37:51.387 --> 00:37:54.923
but at the same time,
it would be so easy to go down there


573
00:37:54.956 --> 00:37:56.124
and provoke him...

574
00:37:57.125 --> 00:37:58.727
and get the material I need.

575
00:38:30.959 --> 00:38:32.628
*

576
00:38:47.576 --> 00:38:48.610
Go.

577
00:38:50.512 --> 00:38:51.713
Why should I go?

578
00:38:51.747 --> 00:38:53.114
'Cause
I want you to go.


579
00:38:55.617 --> 00:38:57.385
How come?

580
00:38:57.419 --> 00:38:59.988
Because I don't want you to
make this documentary anymore.


581
00:39:00.021 --> 00:39:01.957
Take your money
and go, please.


582
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:03.358
What's going on?

583
00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:05.026
- What's the problem?
- Sara, leave.


584
00:39:07.463 --> 00:39:09.364
Aaron, I'm not leaving.

585
00:39:11.567 --> 00:39:13.535
I'm sorry.

586
00:39:13.569 --> 00:39:15.904
You told me
once we got started,


587
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:17.439
there was no turning back.

588
00:39:20.075 --> 00:39:21.409
I'm not turning back.

589
00:39:23.845 --> 00:39:25.346
Turn that song back on.

590
00:39:26.047 --> 00:39:26.982
Why?

591
00:39:27.015 --> 00:39:28.717
Because I said so.

592
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.018
Tell me why.

593
00:39:30.051 --> 00:39:32.120
Because it's my favorite
song in the world,


594
00:39:32.153 --> 00:39:34.122
and I need it
because I love it.


595
00:39:35.056 --> 00:39:36.692
What do you love about it?

596
00:39:36.725 --> 00:39:40.496
Um, maybe because it does more
with one instrumental slow jam


597
00:39:40.529 --> 00:39:45.100
than any poet with any quill has ever
done in the history of time, ever.


598
00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:46.735
I've never heard of it before.

599
00:39:46.768 --> 00:39:48.904
Well, you wouldn't have.

600
00:39:48.937 --> 00:39:52.007
Barely anyone has.
It's from an unknown band


601
00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.975
from a long time ago.

602
00:39:55.711 --> 00:39:57.345
Tell me about it.

603
00:39:57.378 --> 00:39:59.781
Sara, I know what you're trying to do,
and it's not gonna work.


604
00:40:01.382 --> 00:40:03.585
Why won't you tell me
about it, Aaron?


605
00:40:03.619 --> 00:40:05.687
Because...

606
00:40:05.721 --> 00:40:09.324
you think you want to
know my story,


607
00:40:09.357 --> 00:40:12.594
but I promise you,
you do not wanna know my story.


608
00:40:13.629 --> 00:40:14.930
But I do.

609
00:40:14.963 --> 00:40:15.997
Oh, you do?

610
00:40:17.533 --> 00:40:18.734
Really?

611
00:40:19.968 --> 00:40:20.969
Yes.

612
00:40:21.803 --> 00:40:22.938
Fine.

613
00:40:24.439 --> 00:40:27.308
I was 15 years old,
but I could pass for 18


614
00:40:27.342 --> 00:40:28.877
'cause I was big for my age.

615
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.279
I could go to bars
and see live music.


616
00:40:31.312 --> 00:40:34.349
An obscure band
came to town.


617
00:40:34.382 --> 00:40:36.552
There weren't more than
seven of us in the audience,


618
00:40:36.585 --> 00:40:38.119
but I was mesmerized,

619
00:40:38.153 --> 00:40:43.091
in particular by a song called
"Sara loves her Juicy Fruit."


620
00:40:43.124 --> 00:40:44.993
It transported me.

621
00:40:45.026 --> 00:40:47.395
That night, I went
out of town with the band


622
00:40:47.428 --> 00:40:49.731
and I partied with them
where they were staying.


623
00:40:51.332 --> 00:40:53.802
I felt like I belonged
for the first time.


624
00:40:55.336 --> 00:40:56.972
But of course,

625
00:40:57.005 --> 00:40:59.741
they had to move on
to another city the next day.


626
00:41:00.576 --> 00:41:03.612
I walked back towards town,

627
00:41:03.645 --> 00:41:05.914
and a man pulled over
to offer me a ride.


628
00:41:05.947 --> 00:41:10.118
He had a nice, kind face.

629
00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:11.953
And as he opened the door,
he said something to me.


630
00:41:11.987 --> 00:41:13.589
I'll never forget it.
He said...


631
00:41:14.222 --> 00:41:15.557
"Oh, my God.

632
00:41:16.825 --> 00:41:18.059
Oh, my God.

633
00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.196
This is gonna be a good day."

634
00:41:22.931 --> 00:41:24.633
He didn't take me
back to town,


635
00:41:24.666 --> 00:41:26.702
he took me to
a remote part of the woods


636
00:41:26.735 --> 00:41:29.504
where he beat me
within an inch of my life.


637
00:41:29.537 --> 00:41:33.008
He gave me a shovel,
he forced me to dig my own grave,


638
00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:36.311
he tied my hands behind
my back and informed me


639
00:41:36.344 --> 00:41:40.181
that he would be burying me alive
within the next couple of minutes.


640
00:41:40.215 --> 00:41:43.018
And I remember
thinking to myself,


641
00:41:43.051 --> 00:41:46.755
"I should be feeling
really badly about this man,"


642
00:41:47.522 --> 00:41:50.125
but he was magnetic.

643
00:41:50.158 --> 00:41:51.993
I loved him.

644
00:41:52.027 --> 00:41:55.396
He was smart,
he was commanding,


645
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.398
he was wonderful
in all ways.


646
00:41:57.432 --> 00:41:59.000
He only had one flaw.

647
00:41:59.034 --> 00:42:02.437
He was not very good
at tying knots.


648
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:06.341
And as I loosened my hands
from behind my back,


649
00:42:06.374 --> 00:42:08.777
and I wrapped them
around his neck,


650
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.647
overpowering him with my size,

651
00:42:12.948 --> 00:42:14.716
I drained...

652
00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:16.652
his life

653
00:42:17.252 --> 00:42:19.755
with my hands.

654
00:42:19.788 --> 00:42:21.657
And I thought to myself,

655
00:42:24.192 --> 00:42:26.762
"Well, this is my destiny.

656
00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:31.199
Sara loves her juicy fruit.

657
00:42:32.033 --> 00:42:35.270
And Aaron loves to kill."

658
00:42:37.172 --> 00:42:38.940
I stripped him of his clothes,

659
00:42:38.974 --> 00:42:41.509
I threw his body in the hole
he made me dig for myself,


660
00:42:41.542 --> 00:42:44.312
and on instinct,
I took off my own clothes,


661
00:42:44.345 --> 00:42:48.016
and I lay there communing
next to him, all night, naked.


662
00:42:48.049 --> 00:42:50.618
And something very
interesting happened.


663
00:42:50.652 --> 00:42:51.820
You see...

664
00:42:53.254 --> 00:42:55.223
I lied to you earlier.

665
00:42:55.256 --> 00:42:56.424
About what?

666
00:42:56.457 --> 00:42:58.259
About my beard holes.

667
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.962
It's not my hair pattern.

668
00:43:00.996 --> 00:43:05.366
It's actually a rare disease
called trichotillomania.


669
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.303
You know, people pull hairs out
of their beard or their scalp


670
00:43:08.336 --> 00:43:09.504
or even their eyebrows.

671
00:43:09.537 --> 00:43:11.940
You see, my first victim
had this disease,


672
00:43:11.973 --> 00:43:14.209
and when I lay with him naked,

673
00:43:14.242 --> 00:43:18.814
my spirit consumed that
from his spirit...


674
00:43:18.847 --> 00:43:20.481
and it became
a ritual of mine.


675
00:43:20.515 --> 00:43:23.418
All of my victims,
I lay with them naked,


676
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:25.453
and I take a part
of them with me.


677
00:43:27.155 --> 00:43:28.957
And here I am now,

678
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:32.160
a strange but
wonderful amalgamation


679
00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:35.430
of all the 39 men and women
that I have killed,


680
00:43:35.463 --> 00:43:38.700
and it has been the most
glorious part of my life.


681
00:43:38.734 --> 00:43:42.237
It has been my raison d'etre.

682
00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:44.806
And now...

683
00:43:46.174 --> 00:43:47.809
It's gone.

684
00:43:50.846 --> 00:43:54.783
And that is why I'm sad.

685
00:43:54.816 --> 00:43:57.753
And that is why I have
nothing to live for anymore.


686
00:43:57.786 --> 00:44:00.856
And that is why I want
you to go, because tonight


687
00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:03.324
is going to be a very...

688
00:44:03.658 --> 00:44:05.026
bad...

689
00:44:06.594 --> 00:44:08.129
bad night.

690
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.431
Aaron.

691
00:44:10.465 --> 00:44:11.432
Sara.

692
00:44:12.768 --> 00:44:13.969
Stay right there.

693
00:44:36.524 --> 00:44:37.926
Close your eyes.

694
00:44:37.959 --> 00:44:39.094
I don't want to.

695
00:44:39.127 --> 00:44:40.061
Do it.

696
00:44:47.735 --> 00:44:49.070
Shh...

697
00:44:50.271 --> 00:44:51.940
Shh...

698
00:44:54.242 --> 00:44:55.777
Shh...

699
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.725
Do you feel better?

700
00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:14.562
A little bit.

701
00:45:14.595 --> 00:45:15.463
Good.

702
00:45:21.202 --> 00:45:23.038
I'm gonna go
take a shower now.


703
00:45:47.462 --> 00:45:49.931
Hey, Sara,
it's me. Um...


704
00:45:50.932 --> 00:45:52.200
Thank you...

705
00:45:53.368 --> 00:45:54.469
for...

706
00:45:56.838 --> 00:45:58.739
um...

707
00:45:58.773 --> 00:46:03.378
doing what you just did.
I think you are really, really...


708
00:46:04.913 --> 00:46:06.114
special.

709
00:46:06.147 --> 00:46:11.019
And you are inspiring
feelings in me that...


710
00:46:11.052 --> 00:46:13.654
I thought I would
never feel again,


711
00:46:14.122 --> 00:46:15.156
and...

712
00:46:18.626 --> 00:46:20.328
I don't know what to do.

713
00:47:40.141 --> 00:47:41.609
Oh, my God.

714
00:47:41.642 --> 00:47:43.278
Oh, God, you got me.

715
00:47:43.911 --> 00:47:44.946
Yeah?

716
00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.114
How do you feel?

717
00:47:46.647 --> 00:47:47.983
I feel like...

718
00:47:59.227 --> 00:48:00.595
Forty-seven...

719
00:48:01.229 --> 00:48:02.863
forty-eight,

720
00:48:03.531 --> 00:48:05.566
forty-nine,

721
00:48:06.034 --> 00:48:07.302
fifty.

722
00:48:07.335 --> 00:48:10.138
Ready or not,
here I come!


723
00:48:15.776 --> 00:48:16.944
Sara?

724
00:48:17.578 --> 00:48:18.846
Where'd you go?

725
00:48:20.748 --> 00:48:22.917
I'm coming for you.

726
00:48:24.152 --> 00:48:25.320
I got...

727
00:48:26.587 --> 00:48:27.955
Uh-oh.

728
00:48:28.856 --> 00:48:31.059
I think I found you.

729
00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:37.999
Sara?

730
00:48:39.734 --> 00:48:41.436
Are you being bad?

731
00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.142
Sara, where's you go?

732
00:48:51.812 --> 00:48:53.114
Damn it!

733
00:48:53.148 --> 00:48:54.582
You got me!

734
00:48:54.615 --> 00:48:56.417
You don't scare me.

735
00:49:02.157 --> 00:49:03.391
Are you rolling, Sara?

736
00:49:03.424 --> 00:49:04.359
Yeah.

737
00:49:11.366 --> 00:49:13.101
Aaron, if ask you a question,

738
00:49:13.134 --> 00:49:14.602
will you answer honestly?

739
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:16.804
Of course. Always.

740
00:49:19.574 --> 00:49:21.242
When you're holding that ax,

741
00:49:21.276 --> 00:49:25.413
is there a part of you that
wants to ram it into my face?


742
00:49:26.714 --> 00:49:30.118
You know,
considering your past?


743
00:49:31.186 --> 00:49:32.387
Well, of course.

744
00:49:34.122 --> 00:49:35.823
But then...

745
00:49:35.856 --> 00:49:38.926
you know, we wouldn't be able to
have all the fun we are having.


746
00:49:40.595 --> 00:49:42.897
That's interesting. I...

747
00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:45.333
I think I always thought
I was gonna die


748
00:49:45.366 --> 00:49:48.369
before I could share
my work with anyone,


749
00:49:50.938 --> 00:49:52.673
but now I have you.

750
00:49:55.009 --> 00:49:56.377
Which is kinda cool.

751
00:50:02.817 --> 00:50:05.720
Do you feel remorse
for the people you kill?


752
00:50:06.454 --> 00:50:08.389
Um...

753
00:50:08.423 --> 00:50:10.391
Maybe a little bit,
but I also...


754
00:50:10.425 --> 00:50:12.227
I feel like I'm pretty
fair to my victims.


755
00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.496
I try to give them a warning as
to what they're walking into.


756
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.733
That's why I put stuff
in the ad, like...


757
00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:20.735
"Are you a fan of
Interview with the Vampire?"


758
00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:23.104
Like, I want them to know
that I'm dangerous.


759
00:50:23.138 --> 00:50:25.140
You know...
Actually, this is...


760
00:50:26.207 --> 00:50:28.809
One of my latest
was this big ol' sweetie


761
00:50:28.843 --> 00:50:30.345
and... I called him "Buddy."

762
00:50:30.378 --> 00:50:34.382
And I stuck an ax in a stump

763
00:50:34.415 --> 00:50:36.451
outside of the house I rented.

764
00:50:37.452 --> 00:50:39.720
He passed by, he saw it,

765
00:50:39.754 --> 00:50:43.224
he came in anyway and he stayed
with me all night, you know.


766
00:50:43.258 --> 00:50:44.625
I mean, it's almost like...

767
00:50:45.793 --> 00:50:48.729
It's almost like...
like they wanna die.


768
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.332
Did you kill him with that ax?

769
00:50:51.366 --> 00:50:53.768
Uh-huh.

770
00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:56.171
Does that mean you're gonna
murder me with the blender?


771
00:50:57.238 --> 00:50:58.973
That's actually
a brilliant idea.


772
00:50:59.006 --> 00:51:01.142
I've never thought of that
as a weapon before.


773
00:51:02.477 --> 00:51:04.312
But alas, Sara...

774
00:51:04.345 --> 00:51:06.314
I promised
I wouldn't kill you.


775
00:51:06.347 --> 00:51:07.682
And I never lie.

776
00:51:07.715 --> 00:51:09.250
Not in the cards for us.

777
00:51:11.386 --> 00:51:13.087
Well...

778
00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.756
but you said you wouldn't kill me
within the next 24 hours. So...


779
00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:22.930
Now why would you
bring that up?


780
00:51:24.232 --> 00:51:25.966
That only gets you
into trouble.


781
00:51:40.615 --> 00:51:42.817
Hey.

782
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:43.984
What you doin'?

783
00:51:44.018 --> 00:51:45.052
The dishes.

784
00:51:47.322 --> 00:51:48.756
What are you doing
with my camera?


785
00:51:52.393 --> 00:51:54.395
Have you ever spent
any time in the woods?


786
00:51:55.463 --> 00:51:56.564
Sure.

787
00:51:58.366 --> 00:51:59.567
You ever...

788
00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:03.204
just watched a deer, just...

789
00:52:04.405 --> 00:52:05.773
just being a deer?

790
00:52:12.179 --> 00:52:14.014
Put that away. 
That's my job.

791
00:52:15.383 --> 00:52:16.417
Okay.

792
00:52:22.056 --> 00:52:23.190
Psst.

793
00:52:36.203 --> 00:52:38.273
Mommy needs her juice.

794
00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.642
Where is Mommy's juice?

795
00:52:47.014 --> 00:52:51.519
Mommy is thirsty.
Oh, yes!


796
00:52:51.552 --> 00:52:53.120
This better be Coppola wine.

797
00:52:54.154 --> 00:52:55.823
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

798
00:52:55.856 --> 00:52:57.592
Mmm.

799
00:52:57.625 --> 00:52:59.560
- That's nice. Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.


800
00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:02.430
What are you thinking about?

801
00:53:02.463 --> 00:53:05.700
Uh, I'm thinking about this really
cool book that I once read,


802
00:53:05.733 --> 00:53:07.402
called The Journalist
and the Murderer.


803
00:53:07.435 --> 00:53:08.803
- Have you heard of it?
- No.


804
00:53:08.836 --> 00:53:10.605
Oh, it's really great.
You gotta give it a read.


805
00:53:11.472 --> 00:53:13.374
What's it about?

806
00:53:13.408 --> 00:53:17.144
It's sort of about the moral quandary
that journalists face, you know,


807
00:53:17.177 --> 00:53:19.714
uh, how they
sometimes have to lie


808
00:53:19.747 --> 00:53:22.550
and ingratiate themselves
with their subjects, you know,


809
00:53:22.583 --> 00:53:26.253
this little flattery and little
flirtation to get the material they need.


810
00:53:27.054 --> 00:53:28.689
And...

811
00:53:28.723 --> 00:53:30.891
I thought about it
while I was...


812
00:53:30.925 --> 00:53:33.528
watching a little show
called Encounters.


813
00:53:37.932 --> 00:53:39.667
Didn't know I knew
about that, did you?


814
00:53:40.935 --> 00:53:42.537
I know a lot of things, Sara.

815
00:53:44.071 --> 00:53:45.172
Like what?

816
00:53:45.205 --> 00:53:46.907
Oh, no, you don't
make wedding videos.


817
00:53:46.941 --> 00:53:50.845
Um, and I know you have
a knife in your boot.


818
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.150
What are you talking about?
- It's okay.


819
00:53:56.183 --> 00:53:57.952
Don't worry
about it, okay? Look.


820
00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:00.921
Let's see.

821
00:54:00.955 --> 00:54:03.023
I don't think you've been "lying" here,
traditionally, you know.


822
00:54:03.057 --> 00:54:05.826
I think you've been, uh, you've been
playing around with the facts a little bit,


823
00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.895
but look, everybody
does that, okay?


824
00:54:07.928 --> 00:54:09.430
Look, it's one of
my favorite things to do.


825
00:54:09.464 --> 00:54:10.631
It's what I do for a living.

826
00:54:10.665 --> 00:54:11.899
But...

827
00:54:11.932 --> 00:54:14.034
while I do play
around with facts,


828
00:54:14.068 --> 00:54:16.704
I never lie.

829
00:54:16.737 --> 00:54:21.141
My eyes, my heart, my soul,
I always tell the truth


830
00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:24.211
and that's the same kind of truth I've
been feeling from you here today.


831
00:54:24.244 --> 00:54:27.181
So I want you to know

832
00:54:27.214 --> 00:54:30.117
everything's okay.
I'm not mad. Okay?


833
00:54:31.652 --> 00:54:32.520
Okay.

834
00:54:32.553 --> 00:54:34.321
That said,

835
00:54:34.355 --> 00:54:36.924
I'm gonna ask you a question and
I want you to answer me honestly.


836
00:54:38.659 --> 00:54:40.961
Do you believe that
I'm a serial killer?


837
00:54:44.532 --> 00:54:46.801
- No.
- Good. Thank you for your honesty.


838
00:54:46.834 --> 00:54:47.768
Why not?

839
00:54:48.836 --> 00:54:50.405
Well...

840
00:54:50.438 --> 00:54:53.541
First off, the stories you've
been telling are ridiculous.


841
00:54:53.574 --> 00:54:54.842
Okay.

842
00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:57.878
And, like, what's up
with this whole documentary?


843
00:54:58.746 --> 00:55:00.180
If you were a killer,

844
00:55:00.214 --> 00:55:03.584
why would you invite me into
your home and have me film you


845
00:55:03.618 --> 00:55:05.886
confess all the details
of your murders?


846
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.989
Like, what would stop me from
going to the police with this?


847
00:55:09.023 --> 00:55:10.190
It's a fair point.

848
00:55:11.058 --> 00:55:13.961
It is a moot point, however.

849
00:55:13.994 --> 00:55:16.564
You won't go to
the police tomorrow,


850
00:55:16.597 --> 00:55:19.366
because tomorrow,
I'll be dead...


851
00:55:21.335 --> 00:55:22.837
Because tonight,

852
00:55:23.604 --> 00:55:25.372
you are going to kill me.

853
00:55:27.141 --> 00:55:28.976
- Aaron...
- Now before you protest,


854
00:55:29.009 --> 00:55:30.945
I've thought about this.

855
00:55:30.978 --> 00:55:33.981
I'm very excited
about it, okay?


856
00:55:34.014 --> 00:55:37.151
Why would I make my 40th film
another random kill film?


857
00:55:37.184 --> 00:55:38.953
I made 39 of those, okay?

858
00:55:38.986 --> 00:55:42.557
Also, why would we make some stodgy,
pedantic documentary?


859
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:44.291
Plenty of those.

860
00:55:44.324 --> 00:55:45.793
You know what we need?

861
00:55:46.727 --> 00:55:48.262
A murder film...

862
00:55:48.863 --> 00:55:50.197
where the pupil

863
00:55:51.198 --> 00:55:53.300
fells the king.

864
00:55:53.333 --> 00:55:55.169
That's the movie
I wanna make.


865
00:55:56.471 --> 00:55:58.539
What makes you think
I'm gonna do this?


866
00:55:58.573 --> 00:56:01.909
Because I know you well enough to
know that you will do anything


867
00:56:01.942 --> 00:56:03.611
to make a great
piece of art.


868
00:56:05.012 --> 00:56:07.815
And this will be the most

869
00:56:07.848 --> 00:56:11.519
unbelievably exciting
episode of Encounters


870
00:56:11.552 --> 00:56:13.754
that you can possibly imagine.

871
00:56:17.558 --> 00:56:18.893
I know I just
laid a lot on you,


872
00:56:18.926 --> 00:56:20.528
but I have a lot
of experience with this


873
00:56:20.561 --> 00:56:21.696
and I'm the easy way to it.

874
00:56:21.729 --> 00:56:22.997
- I'm super excited.
- Aaron, what is...


875
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:24.832
First things first.
Put that camera down, girl.


876
00:56:24.865 --> 00:56:25.833
What are you doing?

877
00:56:31.171 --> 00:56:34.509
I said put
that camera down, girl.


878
00:56:34.542 --> 00:56:36.210
What's with
the mask, Aaron?


879
00:56:36.243 --> 00:56:38.312
Now you remember, this is Peach Fuzz,
the friendly wolf.


880
00:56:38.345 --> 00:56:39.313
Here, give me the camera.

881
00:56:40.147 --> 00:56:41.381
Okay.

882
00:56:42.016 --> 00:56:43.484
Okay.

883
00:56:43.518 --> 00:56:45.185
Come with me.
Come with me.


884
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:47.555
How are you with an ax?

885
00:56:47.588 --> 00:56:48.956
I've never
used an ax before.


886
00:56:48.989 --> 00:56:50.525
Okay, it's like a bat.

887
00:56:50.558 --> 00:56:52.226
Are you a lefty
or are you a righty?


888
00:56:52.259 --> 00:56:54.762
- Righty.
- Okay, you know what, it doesn't matter. Just get into it.


889
00:56:54.795 --> 00:56:56.597
Okay, I'm wearing a mask

890
00:56:56.631 --> 00:56:59.133
so you don't have to look into
my eyes while you kill me.


891
00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:00.701
It's a little difficult.

892
00:57:00.735 --> 00:57:02.770
Did I mention, it's like a cartoon,
like a funny noise.


893
00:57:02.803 --> 00:57:04.739
Also, I sharpened the ax.

894
00:57:04.772 --> 00:57:06.440
It should go straight
through my neck.


895
00:57:06.473 --> 00:57:09.176
There are very few bones.
Let's do it!


896
00:57:09.209 --> 00:57:11.045
Okay, so, just to be clear,

897
00:57:11.078 --> 00:57:13.714
you want me to take this ax

898
00:57:13.748 --> 00:57:15.683
and chop your head off with it.

899
00:57:15.716 --> 00:57:18.519
Yes, 100%.
Camera heard it first.


900
00:57:18.553 --> 00:57:21.789
Consider it assisted suicide.
It's totally cool.


901
00:57:21.822 --> 00:57:22.790
All right.

902
00:57:23.423 --> 00:57:24.625
Any last words?

903
00:57:25.059 --> 00:57:26.126
Nope.

904
00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.995
I've talked enough
for ten lifetimes.


905
00:57:29.229 --> 00:57:30.230
Wait. Wait.

906
00:57:34.869 --> 00:57:36.370
Okay. Go for it.

907
00:57:37.605 --> 00:57:38.806
Whenever you're ready.

908
00:57:40.575 --> 00:57:43.243
Just reach back
and take a swing.


909
00:57:46.981 --> 00:57:47.982
What's wrong?

910
00:57:53.153 --> 00:57:55.222
- You all right, Sara?
- Yeah.


911
00:57:55.255 --> 00:57:57.124
- Got your frame?
- Yep.


912
00:57:57.157 --> 00:57:58.225
Okie dokie.

913
00:57:58.926 --> 00:57:59.994
Okay.

914
00:58:00.027 --> 00:58:01.762
So, this is a much better idea.

915
00:58:01.796 --> 00:58:03.598
I should have thought of this
in the first place.


916
00:58:03.631 --> 00:58:07.401
This is essentially going to turn
this into a passive endeavor.


917
00:58:07.434 --> 00:58:09.737
What I' going to do,
I'm gonna jump off the ledge,


918
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:11.806
and unless you
come and save me,


919
00:58:11.839 --> 00:58:13.140
I'm gonna die,

920
00:58:13.173 --> 00:58:15.810
which make you complicit
in the murder.


921
00:58:15.843 --> 00:58:17.377
Pretty cool, right?

922
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:19.479
I mean, obviously,
not as cool as putting an ax through my neck,


923
00:58:19.513 --> 00:58:21.415
but for a first-timer,

924
00:58:21.448 --> 00:58:22.516
it'll do.

925
00:58:23.217 --> 00:58:24.251
Ready, Sara?

926
00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.922
Actually, to be honest,
I don't...


927
00:58:27.955 --> 00:58:31.225
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.


928
00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:32.359
Pull yourself up.

929
00:58:37.131 --> 00:58:38.498
Can you breathe?

930
00:58:38.532 --> 00:58:40.635
Aaron? Aaron!

931
00:58:40.668 --> 00:58:42.169
Aaron!

932
00:58:44.571 --> 00:58:45.840
Sara.

933
00:58:47.775 --> 00:58:48.709
Sara?

934
00:58:48.743 --> 00:58:49.777
You in here?

935
00:58:50.177 --> 00:58:51.511
Hello...

936
00:58:51.545 --> 00:58:52.780
Where'd you go?

937
00:58:52.813 --> 00:58:55.783
*I have a really cool idea

938
00:58:55.816 --> 00:58:58.452
* And I'm excited about it

939
00:58:59.153 --> 00:59:00.354
Hey, there you are.

940
00:59:00.387 --> 00:59:01.521
Okay, so...

941
00:59:01.555 --> 00:59:02.957
Before sunrise,

942
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:04.358
put the camera above us.

943
00:59:04.391 --> 00:59:06.727
I play you
"Sara loves her Juicy Fruit"...


944
00:59:09.229 --> 00:59:10.230
What are you doing?

945
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.669
Are you leaving?

946
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.339
Jesus.

947
00:59:19.373 --> 00:59:22.342
- Sara, did I freak you out by hanging myself?
- Fuck off.


948
00:59:22.743 --> 00:59:24.044
What?

949
00:59:24.078 --> 00:59:25.680
I said "Fuck off."

950
00:59:29.316 --> 00:59:30.517
I'm so...

951
00:59:31.451 --> 00:59:33.020
Please don't go. Please.

952
00:59:33.053 --> 00:59:35.656
Do you have any idea
how fucked up that was?


953
00:59:37.524 --> 00:59:38.759
I'm sorry. I was...

954
00:59:38.793 --> 00:59:40.661
I can't believe you
put me in that position.


955
00:59:43.864 --> 00:59:45.900
Can you just stop for a
second so I can explain?


956
00:59:45.933 --> 00:59:46.967
What is wrong with you?

957
00:59:47.001 --> 00:59:48.635
Okay, wait,
just give me one...


958
00:59:48.669 --> 00:59:50.304
What's wrong with you?

959
00:59:50.337 --> 00:59:52.572
One second, please.
Just promise me you won't leave. One second.


960
00:59:59.013 --> 01:00:00.214
Please.

961
01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:06.186
What the fuck is this?

962
01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:09.256
It's a harness.

963
01:00:16.263 --> 01:00:19.700
That's what I was wearing underneath
my shirt when I hanged myself.


964
01:00:19.734 --> 01:00:21.435
I connected a black wire
to the harness,


965
01:00:21.468 --> 01:00:23.370
so I was hanging by my chest,
and I wouldn't...


966
01:00:24.038 --> 01:00:25.806
actually hang myself.

967
01:00:30.044 --> 01:00:31.411
Look...

968
01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:34.314
I'm sorry it freaked you out.

969
01:00:34.348 --> 01:00:36.383
I thought...

970
01:00:36.416 --> 01:00:38.585
I don't know what
I was thinking. I'm just...


971
01:00:43.123 --> 01:00:44.992
Look, I'm not really good
at this, okay,


972
01:00:45.025 --> 01:00:46.393
but I'm just gonna
lay it out there.


973
01:00:48.028 --> 01:00:51.498
I really, really like you.

974
01:00:51.531 --> 01:00:55.903
And I'm just trying
to connect with you.


975
01:00:55.936 --> 01:01:00.107
I'm not really
doing a very good job.


976
01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.442
And I know you don't really
wanna connect with me, so...


977
01:01:03.377 --> 01:01:06.180
what I figured I would do is

978
01:01:06.213 --> 01:01:08.415
give you what
I can give you, which is...


979
01:01:11.786 --> 01:01:15.055
the best episode
of Encounters.


980
01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.158
I can give you. I can...

981
01:01:18.192 --> 01:01:21.762
be a fucked up guy
and show you...


982
01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:24.799
everything that

983
01:01:24.832 --> 01:01:27.201
hopefully gives you
what you want as an artist.


984
01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:31.939
Look...

985
01:01:35.675 --> 01:01:37.077
Am I a murderer?

986
01:01:38.478 --> 01:01:39.446
No.

987
01:01:41.648 --> 01:01:43.818
Of course I'm not a murderer.

988
01:01:43.851 --> 01:01:45.052
Am I a...

989
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.689
sociopathic pathological liar,

990
01:01:49.723 --> 01:01:53.227
who is completely disconnected
from the world and people?


991
01:01:53.527 --> 01:01:54.661
Yes.

992
01:01:58.598 --> 01:02:00.367
Am I majorly connecting
with you


993
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.636
and having a fucking
great time today,


994
01:02:02.669 --> 01:02:08.075
because I get to just lie and be
weird like I really like to do?


995
01:02:08.675 --> 01:02:09.776
Yes.

996
01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:11.011
I just...

997
01:02:11.045 --> 01:02:13.680
I really like you.

998
01:02:14.614 --> 01:02:17.151
And I think you're incredible.

999
01:02:20.387 --> 01:02:21.455
Thank you.

1000
01:02:26.426 --> 01:02:27.594
You're welcome.

1001
01:02:28.728 --> 01:02:30.564
I think it will make
a really good scene.


1002
01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:34.501
I know, right?

1003
01:02:34.534 --> 01:02:36.603
I'm sorry I freaked you out.

1004
01:02:36.636 --> 01:02:38.238
You freaked me out.

1005
01:02:38.272 --> 01:02:39.606
I'm so sorry.

1006
01:02:42.542 --> 01:02:44.945
What are we doing?

1007
01:02:44.979 --> 01:02:46.146
We're gonna play a game.

1008
01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.448
What kind of game
are we playing?


1009
01:02:49.917 --> 01:02:55.155
It's called
"Two Lies and a Truth."


1010
01:02:55.189 --> 01:02:56.790
You play this game
in your castle?


1011
01:02:56.823 --> 01:02:58.025
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.


1012
01:02:58.058 --> 01:02:59.693
So in "Two Lies
and a Truth"...


1013
01:02:59.726 --> 01:03:01.728
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...you're gonna tell three stories,


1014
01:03:01.761 --> 01:03:03.430
and one of them will be true.

1015
01:03:03.463 --> 01:03:05.966
And none of that bullshit,
like, from your heart...


1016
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.534
I got you. I got you.

1017
01:03:07.567 --> 01:03:11.105
- I want facts that are technically correct.
- Okay. All right.


1018
01:03:11.138 --> 01:03:12.339
Two lies, one truth.

1019
01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:14.241
And I get to guess
which one is the truth.


1020
01:03:14.274 --> 01:03:15.175
Okay.

1021
01:03:18.345 --> 01:03:20.547
I was born
three months premature.


1022
01:03:21.748 --> 01:03:23.717
I have never
slept with a woman.


1023
01:03:25.652 --> 01:03:29.356
I can hold my breath for
two and a half minutes.


1024
01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:30.324
Okay.

1025
01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.827
I think that it's...

1026
01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.930
the... the breath one.

1027
01:03:35.963 --> 01:03:36.997
It's number two.

1028
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.836
You want me to be honest,
it's number two.


1029
01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:47.374
You're fucking with me.

1030
01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:50.444
I... I wish I was.

1031
01:03:50.477 --> 01:03:51.845
Did it look like
I was fucking with you


1032
01:03:51.878 --> 01:03:53.347
when you came on to me
in the hot tub?


1033
01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:55.082
Did it look like
I knew what I was doing?


1034
01:03:55.815 --> 01:03:57.584
It was just a weird...

1035
01:03:58.352 --> 01:03:59.686
series of events.

1036
01:03:59.719 --> 01:04:01.956
I didn't have
a normal childhood,


1037
01:04:01.989 --> 01:04:03.023
you know, I...

1038
01:04:04.624 --> 01:04:07.494
I started to notice
my chemistry was off,


1039
01:04:07.527 --> 01:04:10.797
like in those pre-teen years
when I had my first sort of...


1040
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:13.500
like psychotic break
when I was like 14.


1041
01:04:13.533 --> 01:04:16.836
So I was in an institution
until I was about 19,


1042
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:19.573
and they didn't really know
how to properly medicate then,


1043
01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:22.642
so by the time I got out,
I had a split with my family,


1044
01:04:22.676 --> 01:04:23.777
and um...

1045
01:04:25.812 --> 01:04:28.015
And I got a job at security,
which was mostly older people,


1046
01:04:28.048 --> 01:04:29.950
so I didn't really consort
with people my age,


1047
01:04:29.984 --> 01:04:33.353
and then I just missed...
I just missed the boat.


1048
01:04:33.387 --> 01:04:34.388
I just missed it.

1049
01:04:34.854 --> 01:04:36.056
Um...

1050
01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:38.858
Have you ever
had a girlfriend?


1051
01:04:40.194 --> 01:04:41.195
Nope.

1052
01:04:42.529 --> 01:04:43.630
I...

1053
01:04:47.434 --> 01:04:49.603
Have you ever seen that movie,
Never Been Kissed?


1054
01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:51.071
Yeah.

1055
01:04:52.372 --> 01:04:54.608
I should have written
and directed that movie.


1056
01:04:56.776 --> 01:04:57.911
It's embarrassing.

1057
01:04:57.944 --> 01:04:59.346
No, it's not embarrassing.

1058
01:04:59.379 --> 01:05:00.514
It's really embarrassing.

1059
01:05:00.547 --> 01:05:02.782
It's really weird,

1060
01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:04.451
but it's not embarrassing.

1061
01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:09.923
I don't know.

1062
01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.628
Do you wanna
have your first kiss?


1063
01:05:19.066 --> 01:05:20.100
Shut up.

1064
01:05:20.134 --> 01:05:21.468
It soesn't have to
be a big deal.


1065
01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.204
Really?

1066
01:05:24.238 --> 01:05:25.139
Yeah.

1067
01:05:25.872 --> 01:05:27.041
You would kiss me?

1068
01:05:27.074 --> 01:05:27.974
Yeah.

1069
01:05:30.077 --> 01:05:32.146
Okay.

1070
01:05:34.714 --> 01:05:36.116
Who makes the move?

1071
01:05:52.132 --> 01:05:53.200
That was cool.

1072
01:06:03.743 --> 01:06:06.246
You know,
I'm super excited about this idea.


1073
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.148
I have the climax
to the episode.


1074
01:06:08.182 --> 01:06:09.583
So where
are you taking me?


1075
01:06:09.616 --> 01:06:11.418
Like
I'm gonna tell you.


1076
01:06:11.451 --> 01:06:12.919
Watch your head.

1077
01:06:12.952 --> 01:06:15.122
All good things to
those who wait, my dear.


1078
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:18.024
Come this way.

1079
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.132
Okay.

1080
01:06:25.165 --> 01:06:27.301
All right, now,
before we get started,


1081
01:06:27.334 --> 01:06:28.802
I do have a surprise for you,

1082
01:06:28.835 --> 01:06:30.537
but you have to
close your eyes.


1083
01:06:31.338 --> 01:06:32.772
Why would I close my eyes?

1084
01:06:32.806 --> 01:06:34.108
There's no fucking way.

1085
01:06:34.141 --> 01:06:36.410
I'm in the middle of nowhere
at night with you.


1086
01:06:36.443 --> 01:06:38.812
That's a very good point.
Point taken,


1087
01:06:38.845 --> 01:06:40.447
but it will be worth it.

1088
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.515
Trust me.

1089
01:06:41.548 --> 01:06:42.582
Okay.

1090
01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:45.819
All right.

1091
01:06:53.327 --> 01:06:54.528
Open it.

1092
01:06:56.796 --> 01:06:58.031
What is this?

1093
01:06:58.064 --> 01:07:01.335
It's a symbol of
my affection for you


1094
01:07:01.368 --> 01:07:04.804
and of our amazing day
we spent together.


1095
01:07:04.838 --> 01:07:07.040
Sorry, there's a picture of
me and another guy in there.


1096
01:07:07.073 --> 01:07:10.910
I didn't have a chance to make
one specifically for you.


1097
01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.379
You were a bit
of a surprise.


1098
01:07:13.813 --> 01:07:14.648
May I?

1099
01:07:14.981 --> 01:07:15.949
Okay.

1100
01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.156
Cool.

1101
01:07:22.189 --> 01:07:24.491
All tight. It's time
for part two.


1102
01:07:24.524 --> 01:07:25.592
Ready?

1103
01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:26.593
Okay.

1104
01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:33.333
I don't get it.

1105
01:07:42.176 --> 01:07:43.377
Oh, shit.

1106
01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.014
When did you dig that?

1107
01:07:48.047 --> 01:07:49.483
I dug it before
you got here.


1108
01:07:49.516 --> 01:07:52.219
I wasn't sure if it was
supposed to be for me


1109
01:07:52.252 --> 01:07:54.154
or for you.

1110
01:07:54.188 --> 01:07:56.122
But I think I finally
figured it out.


1111
01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.361
Okay.

1112
01:08:07.601 --> 01:08:09.903
Tada!

1113
01:08:09.936 --> 01:08:12.439
Nope, nope, nope.
It's yours.


1114
01:08:12.472 --> 01:08:15.709
I snuck it out of your boot
after I fell on you.


1115
01:08:15.742 --> 01:08:17.744
Thought for sure
you would have noticed that.


1116
01:08:19.813 --> 01:08:21.215
Are you ready

1117
01:08:21.248 --> 01:08:23.583
for the grand finale
of the episode?


1118
01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:26.353
Okay.

1119
01:08:50.043 --> 01:08:52.346
It's all right.

1120
01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:54.714
We both stab each other
and we both crawl in the grave


1121
01:08:54.748 --> 01:08:57.016
and we die together
like Romeo and Juliet,


1122
01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:00.086
and somebody would
find the tapes.


1123
01:09:00.119 --> 01:09:01.755
And when they see it,
we'll be like,


1124
01:09:02.356 --> 01:09:03.790
history together.

1125
01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:08.428
Look, you're afraid.

1126
01:09:08.462 --> 01:09:10.530
Don't be afraid.
I'm not gonna stab you.


1127
01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:13.567
Here. I love you too much.
Take it. Take the knife.


1128
01:09:14.468 --> 01:09:15.535
You do it.

1129
01:09:18.405 --> 01:09:19.473
Come on.

1130
01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:21.408
Do it.

1131
01:09:23.777 --> 01:09:24.844
Come on.

1132
01:09:31.785 --> 01:09:32.752
Sara...

1133
01:09:33.219 --> 01:09:34.220
Wait!

1134
01:09:40.627 --> 01:09:41.561
Sara!

1135
01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:43.930
Sara!

1136
01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:51.905
Sara!

1137
01:09:54.341 --> 01:09:55.342
Sara!

1138
01:09:56.242 --> 01:09:57.277
Sara!

1139
01:10:05.619 --> 01:10:06.820
Sara!

1140
01:10:10.223 --> 01:10:11.658
You're in the middle
of nowhere.


1141
01:10:14.728 --> 01:10:15.995
Come on, Sara.

1142
01:10:19.999 --> 01:10:22.268
I have the keys.
There's nowhere to go.


1143
01:10:43.423 --> 01:10:44.591
Sara?

1144
01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:50.664
Your best episode...

1145
01:13:17.877 --> 01:13:18.845
So...

1146
01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.082
I don't think
I'm gonna die tonight.


1147
01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:28.454
I kind of feel bad
about it. It's...


1148
01:13:30.256 --> 01:13:32.559
It was my whole idea
in the first place.


1149
01:13:35.929 --> 01:13:36.996
But, Sara...

1150
01:13:42.035 --> 01:13:43.169
you did it.

1151
01:13:44.738 --> 01:13:48.174
You made a great,
great episode.


1152
01:13:49.543 --> 01:13:51.545
You should be really
proud of yourself.


1153
01:13:55.649 --> 01:13:57.984
I'm bummed you're not
gonna be here to see it.


1154
01:14:01.955 --> 01:14:04.958
It's kind of ironic
'cause I never thought I was...


1155
01:14:06.459 --> 01:14:09.328
I really don't
wanna kill again.


1156
01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:11.765
That was real,
but then it was you,


1157
01:14:12.799 --> 01:14:14.000
my muse.

1158
01:14:17.136 --> 01:14:18.938
You inspired me.

1159
01:14:22.175 --> 01:14:23.610
My Coppola.

1160
01:16:43.416 --> 01:16:45.752
* You should have known

1161
01:16:45.785 --> 01:16:47.553
* Yet unashamed

1162
01:16:47.586 --> 01:16:49.488
* That there's no way

1163
01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:53.326
* To save
Your wasted flower of youth *


1164
01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:55.428
* But you feel the same

1165
01:16:55.461 --> 01:16:59.833
* In spite of
All he did to you *


1166
01:16:59.866 --> 01:17:02.501
* Sweet heart cut up face

1167
01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:07.206
* That I would have died
Any number of times for *


1168
01:17:08.174 --> 01:17:10.910
* Beat down and beat down

1169
01:17:10.944 --> 01:17:15.281
* So peculiar so beloved

1170
01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:50.750
* Sunday morning
I wake up in the dawn *


1171
01:17:50.784 --> 01:17:55.354
* Startled by the sound
Of chewing *


1172
01:17:55.388 --> 01:17:58.825
* Sara looked down
I was beckoned by a smile *


1173
01:17:58.858 --> 01:18:03.229
* She grabbed me by the wrist
And met me *


1174
01:18:12.038 --> 01:18:15.374
* In the garden
We proceeded past the gates *


1175
01:18:15.408 --> 01:18:19.946
* And crept around the hedge
Of fruit trees *


1176
01:18:19.979 --> 01:18:23.616
* She took me to a hilltop
And jumped into the lake *


1177
01:18:23.649 --> 01:18:28.221
* I kicked off both my shoes
And dove in *


1178
01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:48.908
* Sara loves her Juicy Fruit

1179
01:18:48.942 --> 01:18:50.743
* I give her a stick
Of Doublemint *


1180
01:18:50.776 --> 01:18:53.179
* She gives me the boot

1181
01:18:53.212 --> 01:18:56.950
* And when she struts
She struts while she chews *


1182
01:18:56.983 --> 01:18:59.118
* Nothing there
To slow her down *


1183
01:18:59.152 --> 01:19:01.220
* Could you say the same
For me or you? *


1184
01:19:01.254 --> 01:19:05.191
* Sara loves her Juicy Fruit

1185
01:19:05.224 --> 01:19:09.795
* Melting on the trampoline
She thinks I'm kinda cute *


1186
01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:13.599
* And when we stroll
We walk against the crowd *


1187
01:19:13.632 --> 01:19:15.969
* Nobody can top us
She goes... *
