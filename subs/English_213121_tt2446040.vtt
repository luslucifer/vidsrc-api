3
00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:22.857
Betsy.

4
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:23.983
No!

5
00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:25.360
Watch out! He's right behind you!

6
00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:26.528
Hey, down in front!

7
00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:27.904
Sorry.

8
00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.782
I'm coming to get you, Betsy!

9
00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.033
Run, Betsy!

10
00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:33.243
- Run!
- Come on.


11
00:00:33.368 --> 00:00:35.370
There's no way
she can outrun a vampire.


12
00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.206
Don't listen to her, Betsy.
You can do it. Don't give up.


13
00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:42.460
Are we there yet?

14
00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:43.962
Not for a few more hours, Bonnie.

15
00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:45.630
You can go back to sleep.

16
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:48.716
Help! Open the door!

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.052
No one can help you now, Betsy.

18
00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:52.804
- Boring!
- Patience.


19
00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:55.056
All great horror films start slowly.

20
00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:56.307
You see, they're designed...

21
00:00:58.393 --> 00:00:59.936
Please, let me in!

22
00:01:09.487 --> 00:01:11.447
Tactics, Betsy, tactics.

23
00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:14.158
Look for something
to defend yourself with!


24
00:01:14.284 --> 00:01:15.326
There we go.

25
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.161
Technically, that'll be useless.

26
00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:19.914
Everybody knows
a wooden stake through the heart


27
00:01:19.998 --> 00:01:22.375
is the only way to kill a vampire!

28
00:01:25.044 --> 00:01:27.839
Only a kitty cat. 
Classic misdirection.

29
00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:29.090
A cat?

30
00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:31.175
Come on, guys, this isn't scary.

31
00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:39.767
Help!

32
00:01:40.184 --> 00:01:41.185
Get me out of here!

33
00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:42.854
- Jessie!
- We have to get her out!


34
00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:46.816
Jessie! Jessie, can you hear me?

35
00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:55.366
Okay, everyone, on three.

36
00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:56.993
One, two, three!

37
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.665
Jessie? Jessie!

38
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.626
What's the matter with Jessie?

39
00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.461
She was abandoned in a box for years.

40
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:09.547
I couldn't... I couldn't find a way out.

41
00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:12.050
Mom, can I bring my toys?

42
00:02:26.814 --> 00:02:28.566
The roadside motel

43
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.027
is one of the most
common locales for a horror film.


44
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.030
Remote, isolated, ordinary.

45
00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:35.490
A comforting environment

46
00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:37.700
to allay the suspicions of the audience.

47
00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:39.243
I expect they'll be asking the innkeeper

48
00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:40.953
to use the telephone any minute now.

49
00:02:41.037 --> 00:02:42.664
Would it be okay
if I used your phone?

50
00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.165
Our car has a flat.

51
00:02:44.248 --> 00:02:45.708
Right on cue.

52
00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:47.710
It's okay, Jessie. 
You're safe now.

53
00:02:47.794 --> 00:02:50.004
We'll be back
on the road before you know it.


54
00:02:50.088 --> 00:02:51.422
What's the latest, Trixie?

55
00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.008
She's still on the phone
with the tow truck company.


56
00:02:54.092 --> 00:02:56.344
6:00 a.m.?
That's the earliest you can get here?


57
00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:57.553
6:00 a.m.?

58
00:02:57.637 --> 00:02:59.347
You mean we have
to stay here all night?


59
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.682
Bum, bum, bum

60
00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:02.183
I don't care where we are

61
00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.560
as long as I'm not stuck
alone in that box.


62
00:03:04.644 --> 00:03:06.521
If you could
just sign here in the guestbook.


63
00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:09.774
I'll need to see
a major credit card for the incidentals.


64
00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.192
Okay, let's see here.

65
00:03:11.275 --> 00:03:13.277
I'm going to put you in room seven.

66
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:15.613
You know,
we have a little saying around here,


67
00:03:15.822 --> 00:03:19.534
at the Sleep Well Motel,
you're gonna sleep well.


68
00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:30.378
Well, it looks like they're asleep.

69
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.462
Finally.

70
00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:33.673
Potato Head, where are you...
Where are you going?


71
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:36.342
We're at a motel.
I just wanna check out the amenities.


72
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.469
You know, the free stuff?

73
00:03:38.553 --> 00:03:40.972
Little soaps, shower caps, shampoo?

74
00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.140
Conditioner?

75
00:03:42.223 --> 00:03:44.434
I wouldn't go out
there if I were you.

76
00:03:44.517 --> 00:03:45.977
The first to leave usually gets it.

77
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.187
Potato Head, don't leave the bag.

78
00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:51.023
A motel is one of
the easiest places for a toy to get lost!


79
00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:52.483
Shut your worry hole!

80
00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:53.943
Nobody's gonna get lost.

81
00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:57.155
Besides, I promised Hamm
I'd bring him back something nice.


82
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.656
Wait. Where are you guys going?

83
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.992
We were just gonna
check out the free stuff.


84
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.952
And if something
does happen to the potato,


85
00:04:03.035 --> 00:04:04.620
I wouldn't want to miss it.

86
00:04:04.704 --> 00:04:07.373
Come on, guys!
Let's all just stay in the bag.


87
00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:09.792
Buzz, I'll grab those guys.
You get Potato Head.


88
00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:11.961
- Got it.
- No, wait. Don't go!


89
00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:13.546
Don't worry, Jessie. 
I'll be right back.

90
00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.714
Buzz!

91
00:04:23.848 --> 00:04:25.683
Guys! Guys, where are you?

92
00:04:26.893 --> 00:04:28.102
Jessie, what's wrong? Are you okay?

93
00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:29.771
Buzz, where is everybody?

94
00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:31.773
Not to worry. We're all right here.

95
00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:34.275
See, there's Woody,
Pricklepants, Trixie, Rex...


96
00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:36.277
Wait. Where's Potato Head?

97
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.196
And so it begins.

98
00:04:38.738 --> 00:04:40.948
Pricklepants, you're not helping!

99
00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:43.868
I'm just saying it's quite
common in these types of movies


100
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:46.704
for one unsuspecting
character to wander off and vanish.


101
00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:48.664
Well,
he couldn't have just disappeared.


102
00:04:48.748 --> 00:04:49.957
Maybe this place is haunted.

103
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:51.167
What? It's haunted?

104
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.337
Of course not.
Everybody knows ghosts aren't real.


105
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.589
Actually,
according to my Internet research...


106
00:04:56.672 --> 00:04:57.757
Highly unlikely.

107
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.884
There has to be a rational explanation.

108
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:01.803
We need to break into groups of two.

109
00:05:01.886 --> 00:05:03.221
Everyone,
keep an eye on your partner.


110
00:05:03.304 --> 00:05:05.181
If anything goes wrong, give a yell.

111
00:05:07.433 --> 00:05:09.227
I stepped in something.

112
00:05:09.435 --> 00:05:10.937
Wait a minute.

113
00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:15.691
What is it?

114
00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:16.859
Disgusting.

115
00:05:16.943 --> 00:05:18.069
Well, were this a movie,

116
00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:20.947
I'd say it was slime
from the creature's metamorphosis.


117
00:05:21.572 --> 00:05:25.243
Yeah, well, whatever it is,
Potato Head managed to step in it,


118
00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:27.245
leaving behind a trail of footprints.

119
00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:29.664
If we follow it,
it should lead us right to him.


120
00:05:29.747 --> 00:05:31.999
- Hey, guys!
- No, wait! Trixie, don't!


121
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:34.544
Trixie!

122
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:39.006
- Trixie?
- Potato Head!


123
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.384
And this would be the threshold.

124
00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:42.718
Every movie has one, you know.

125
00:05:42.802 --> 00:05:46.264
Once the heroes enter,
there's no turning back.


126
00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:47.306
- Rex, hurry up!
- Coming!


127
00:05:49.058 --> 00:05:49.976
Now we just need
to find a way down.

128
00:05:52.478 --> 00:05:54.230
Well, that did the job.

129
00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:55.565
Sorry! Sorry-

130
00:05:55.648 --> 00:05:56.899
ls everyone okay?

131
00:05:56.983 --> 00:05:59.819
- That way!
- All right, everybody, stay close.


132
00:06:16.752 --> 00:06:18.129
So what happens now?

133
00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.756
Well, this would be the part
where the characters get separated


134
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.592
and then picked off one by one...

135
00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:25.261
Then what happens next?

136
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:27.096
Where's Pricklepants?

137
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:29.348
Well, he was
standing right here just a moment ago.


138
00:06:29.432 --> 00:06:30.558
What are we gonna do now?

139
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:33.853
He was the only one who knew
what the heck was going on...


140
00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:42.987
Wait, wait, listen!

141
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.196
I think we lost it.

142
00:06:45.615 --> 00:06:46.657
It's over there!

143
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.784
Over here!

144
00:06:49.076 --> 00:06:50.870
I think I can see it.

145
00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:53.247
It's staring right at us.

146
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.169
It's Potato Head's arm!

147
00:06:58.252 --> 00:07:00.212
Wait a minute. it looks like it's
trying to tell us something.


148
00:07:00.296 --> 00:07:01.339
What is it, little buddy?

149
00:07:01.422 --> 00:07:03.341
Think he's using
some kind of hand signals.


150
00:07:03.424 --> 00:07:04.467
It's the number one!

151
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.593
No, no. One letter!

152
00:07:05.676 --> 00:07:07.845
One syllable? Once upon a time!

153
00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:09.221
One plus one is one!

154
00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:12.516
I think maybe it's pointing up.

155
00:07:13.643 --> 00:07:15.394
- Up. Of course.
- Yeah.


156
00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:29.575
Pass me the hand, will you?

157
00:07:44.632 --> 00:07:45.883
What now?

158
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.219
Out the door and to the right.

159
00:07:48.302 --> 00:07:49.345
What? Are you sure?

160
00:07:49.428 --> 00:07:51.055
The hand looks like
it's pointing left to me.


161
00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:52.807
- Over here.
- What?


162
00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:54.725
Look over here.

163
00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:56.310
Hello? Hello?

164
00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:57.561
Sure, if you hold it that way.

165
00:07:57.687 --> 00:07:58.979
Hey' guys. wait up!

166
00:07:59.438 --> 00:08:00.648
Woody! Buzz!

167
00:08:02.233 --> 00:08:04.026
Quiet, soldier!

168
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.236
You'll lead them right to us.

169
00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:07.780
This place isn't safe for toys.

170
00:08:07.863 --> 00:08:10.324
Combat Carl
is gonna take his hand away now.


171
00:08:10.408 --> 00:08:12.910
You yell, we're done for. Got it?

172
00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:18.207
Combat Carl's seen things,
horrible things.


173
00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:22.586
Combat Carl's learned you gotta keep
movin', or else they find you!


174
00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:25.381
Are you Combat Carl?

175
00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:27.717
The only thing that's
kept Combat Carl going


176
00:08:27.842 --> 00:08:31.679
is the thought he might
see his owner Billy just one more time.


177
00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:36.767
You better turn back now,
or you'll never see your owner again!


178
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:38.269
But I need to find my friends!

179
00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.980
This is what happens
when you try to find your friends!


180
00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:43.441
Did you hear that?

181
00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:54.368
It found us. We're trapped!

182
00:08:54.452 --> 00:08:56.078
Nah, Combat Carl never gives up.

183
00:08:56.162 --> 00:08:58.622
Combat Carl finds a way.
We gotta move. You ready?


184
00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:01.584
- What? No!
- We're going on three. One, two, three!


185
00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:03.627
Grab my arm!

186
00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:05.921
Carl, wait!

187
00:09:06.005 --> 00:09:07.214
Carl!

188
00:09:07.882 --> 00:09:11.594
Forget about Combat Carl! Just go!

189
00:09:57.223 --> 00:09:58.724
Hey!

190
00:10:00.226 --> 00:10:02.853
Let me go, you big Varmint!

191
00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:06.357
Let me go this instant!

192
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.362
Thank you. Well, it's been fun.

193
00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.211
Looks old.

194
00:10:27.837 --> 00:10:29.505
Yeah, probably worth something.

195
00:10:29.588 --> 00:10:31.590
Excellent find, Mr. Jones.

196
00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:53.195
He's gone. All clear!

197
00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:54.822
Jessie!

198
00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:55.948
Buzz!

199
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:57.449
I'm so glad you're safe.

200
00:10:57.575 --> 00:11:00.661
Nice to see
you made it here in one piece, cowgirl.


201
00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:02.079
Carl!

202
00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:04.206
Combat Carl
would like to introduce you


203
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.668
to his one-third-scale
counterpart, Combat Carl Jr.


204
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.336
Ma'am. Sorry to break up the party,

205
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.963
but we're on a tight schedule.

206
00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:12.464
Pocketeer, you're up!

207
00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:14.174
Pockets away!

208
00:11:20.347 --> 00:11:21.890
Lego Bunny, go!

209
00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:26.854
Any sign of our guy or the lizard?

210
00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:28.856
No, sir. Area is still clear.

211
00:11:28.939 --> 00:11:30.858
Hey, Old Timer, how we doin'?

212
00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:33.569
Well, sir,
he's been gone for 90 seconds.


213
00:11:33.652 --> 00:11:35.821
I reckon he could be back any minute.

214
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.907
Okay, let's try this again!
Third time's the charm.


215
00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:40.492
You can do it, Junior.

216
00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:45.789
Steady. Take it easy now.

217
00:11:46.707 --> 00:11:48.959
Almost got it!

218
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:52.880
- Oh, no!
- Good grief!


219
00:11:52.963 --> 00:11:54.048
Sassafras!

220
00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:58.093
That was the last one.
That means I'm next!


221
00:11:58.177 --> 00:12:01.639
Don't you see?
I'm the last of the Fastener Four!


222
00:12:01.972 --> 00:12:04.224
Look! Zipper Man, Snaps, Speed Lacer.

223
00:12:04.308 --> 00:12:06.685
I'm next. I'm next! I'm next!

224
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:08.520
Keep it together, man!
We'll find a way out.


225
00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:11.065
We'll get out, all right.

226
00:12:11.273 --> 00:12:13.025
- In boxes.
- What?


227
00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.860
Jessie, nobody's getting boxed up.

228
00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.195
We're leaving together.

229
00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.363
You have a sale.

230
00:12:18.489 --> 00:12:20.449
Pez Cat, what do you see?

231
00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.826
It's hard to make out,

232
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.788
but it looks like a cowboy.

233
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.669
Let's see what's next to go.

234
00:12:32.044 --> 00:12:34.672
What? $2,000?

235
00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:38.342
Jones!
Jones, you're not gonna believe this!


236
00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:43.097
Happy trails, Cowboy Andy.

237
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.148
It's like taking candy from a baby.

238
00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:58.987
He'll be able to get out, won't he?

239
00:12:59.071 --> 00:13:00.698
I haven't got the foggiest idea.

240
00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:03.158
What started out
as a classic horror film


241
00:13:03.242 --> 00:13:05.661
has turned into
something more of a tragedy.


242
00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:08.747
I can't believe
we're never gonna see Bonnie again.


243
00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:11.834
Combat Carl would have liked to have
seen Billy just...


244
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.044
...one more time.

245
00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.548
We'll find a way, Carl. 
We'll find a way.

246
00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:19.174
Well, you better hurry, Sergeant.

247
00:13:19.258 --> 00:13:21.260
Sun's fixin' to rise any minute now.

248
00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:22.845
You have a sale.

249
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:24.263
People, back to your positions!

250
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.059
All right. Come on, big money!

251
00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:32.020
- Who is it this time?
- Okay, I'm looking. I'm looking.


252
00:13:32.104 --> 00:13:33.397
Oh, my gosh, he's getting up!

253
00:13:33.647 --> 00:13:36.733
Jonesy, Jonesy,
we got another gold mine!


254
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.239
Looks like you get to
go on a little trip.

255
00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:45.868
Yeah, you got a guest
with a flat tire that needs fixing?


256
00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:48.787
Absolutely. Come on.
I'll show you the way.


257
00:13:49.413 --> 00:13:50.664
Okay, kids, he's gone!

258
00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:57.463
It's no use! I'm not tall enough!

259
00:13:57.754 --> 00:14:00.757
I'll go get Woody. Together we'll be
able to reach the handle.


260
00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.759
- Good plan, Jessie.
- Someone's at the door!


261
00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:05.554
Yeah, so that big stack there

262
00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:07.306
and the ones on
the counter all go, too.

263
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:08.599
Okay.

264
00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:11.435
Looks like I'm gonna
have to take two trips.


265
00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:14.771
Woody!

266
00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:16.023
All right, we need a plan B.

267
00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:17.441
Put on your thinking caps, people.

268
00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:19.776
I got it! She can make a
break for the delivery truck.


269
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.988
It's broad daylight.
Besides, she'll never make it in time.


270
00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:26.116
What do I do?
Now we're all gonna end up in a box.


271
00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:28.410
Wait. That's it! 
Jessie, say that again!

272
00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:31.455
Say what?
That we're all gonna end up in boxes?


273
00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:34.833
- Not us, you. You're gonna get in a box.
- What?


274
00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.543
Listen, in a few minutes,
the delivery lady


275
00:14:36.627 --> 00:14:37.920
is gonna come back through that door

276
00:14:38.003 --> 00:14:40.839
and take the other boxes,
and you're gonna be in one of 'em.


277
00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.257
It's the only way to free Woody.

278
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:44.843
No. No way. I can't. 
I can't do that!

279
00:14:44.927 --> 00:14:46.929
I can't get in a box. I can't!

280
00:14:47.012 --> 00:14:48.055
There's gotta be another way.

281
00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:50.599
This is the way!
You better snap out of it, soldier!


282
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:53.060
We're running out of time,
and you're the only chance we've got!


283
00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:54.978
No! I can't!

284
00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:57.981
Jessie, listen to me.
Remember your training.


285
00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.775
But I don't have any training!

286
00:14:59.942 --> 00:15:00.984
Well, forget about that.

287
00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.654
When Combat Carl
gets stuck in a jam, he says to himself,


288
00:15:03.779 --> 00:15:08.325
"Combat Carl never gives up.
Combat Carl finds a way." Now say it!


289
00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:09.660
Combat Carl never gives up? Combat...

290
00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:10.786
You're not Combat Carl!

291
00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:13.372
Jessie never gives up.
Jessie finds a way.


292
00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:14.623
I can't hear you!

293
00:15:14.706 --> 00:15:18.168
Jessie never gives up!
Jessie finds a way! Yeah!


294
00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:20.295
One more thing. Keep it down.

295
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.965
I'll try.

296
00:15:36.853 --> 00:15:38.522
Wake up! You're free!

297
00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:43.902
Who dares summon Transitron?

298
00:15:43.986 --> 00:15:45.737
I need to use this box.

299
00:15:45.821 --> 00:15:47.239
Transitron free?

300
00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:49.074
Yes, that's right.
Here, give me your hand.


301
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.494
What the... How can I ever repay you?

302
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.622
Seal me in.

303
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.252
Okay, here goes.

304
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.346
Okay.

305
00:16:12.431 --> 00:16:14.141
Wait, wait. Don't tape it!

306
00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:15.559
I won't be able to get out!

307
00:16:15.684 --> 00:16:18.770
Just close the flaps and put that box on
top. It'll keep it shut.


308
00:16:18.854 --> 00:16:20.355
Are you sure about this?

309
00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:22.858
No, not really.

310
00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:29.823
By Globbatron's ghost,
you shall be remembered!


311
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:31.617
- All right.
- Transitron, separate!


312
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.452
Need anything else?

313
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.622
Well, the plan seems to be working.

314
00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:38.206
So far, so good.

315
00:16:41.752 --> 00:16:43.795
Forgot the tape again?

316
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.089
What? No...

317
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.101
She got sealed in!

318
00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:00.145
That's it.
We're never gonna get outta here.


319
00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:03.815
Nah. Jessie never gives up.
Jessie finds a way.


320
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.151
You're good to go.

321
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.402
Thank you so much.

322
00:17:07.486 --> 00:17:09.946
Don't forget your bag, Bonnie.
We're leaving in two minutes.


323
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.366
Excuse me. Coming through.

324
00:17:28.215 --> 00:17:30.300
Jessie never gives up.
Jessie finds a way.


325
00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:32.469
Jessie never gives up.
Jessie finds a way.


326
00:17:33.637 --> 00:17:35.514
Jessie never gives up.
Jessie finds a way.


327
00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.599
Jessie never gives up.
Jessie finds a way.


328
00:17:37.683 --> 00:17:39.476
Jessie never gives up...

329
00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:41.561
Jessie finds a way!

330
00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.442
Woody! Woody!

331
00:17:47.526 --> 00:17:49.569
Jessie! Jessie, over here!

332
00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:56.326
It's been a while.
I don't think she's coming back.


333
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.494
Patience.

334
00:17:57.577 --> 00:18:00.163
Cinematic structure
dictates it's always darkest...


335
00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:02.791
Can it, Pants! Life ain't a movie.
They're never coming back.


336
00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:04.418
Look! They're coming back!

337
00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:07.087
- Hooray! Yeah!
- Yeah, she did it!


338
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.463
Checking out?

339
00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:10.590
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

340
00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:12.592
We did. Thanks.

341
00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:13.635
Come on, Jess! Let's move!

342
00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:14.719
Mom, are we going to Grandma's now?

343
00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:17.305
- In a minute, honey.
- Bonnie!


344
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.975
Okay, now climb on my shoulders,
and then we'll...


345
00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:21.518
Jessie? Jessie!

346
00:18:21.852 --> 00:18:22.769
What is she doing?

347
00:18:22.853 --> 00:18:23.854
She's headed straight for the curtain!

348
00:18:23.937 --> 00:18:25.105
That's not part of the plan.

349
00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.443
Jessie!

350
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.038
Come on.

351
00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:55.552
- My hand!
- See? Told you.


352
00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.015
Perfect!

353
00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:03.852
I can't look.

354
00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:09.691
Come and get it!

355
00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:13.612
Thanks for staying with us
at the Sleep Well.


356
00:19:15.655 --> 00:19:16.823
MY toys!

357
00:19:16.907 --> 00:19:20.118
No, no. Little girl,
that area is for employees only!


358
00:19:20.202 --> 00:19:21.244
Hey!

359
00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:22.412
I can't have you back here.

360
00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:24.289
Are those my daughter's toys?

361
00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.419
Jessie!

362
00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:32.714
Those... They might be hers.

363
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.845
This was just an honest mistake.

364
00:19:38.929 --> 00:19:40.680
You know,
I really should call the police.


365
00:19:40.764 --> 00:19:42.182
The police?

366
00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:44.017
Come on. There's no need
to involve the authorities.


367
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.353
Come on, Bonnie. Let's go.
We're leaving.


368
00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.812
Would you consider selling them?

369
00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:50.357
Tell you what.
I'll give you $100 for the cowboy.


370
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.734
What do you want? $200?

371
00:19:58.657 --> 00:20:02.661
The epilogue. We're back to the
location where it all began.


372
00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.037
I never thought I'd miss the trunk.

373
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.498
You did it, Jessie. 
You saved us all.

374
00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:09.376
Jessie didn't give up.
Jessie found a way.


375
00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.754
Well, Woody wants to say thanks.

376
00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:15.215
Potato Head!
Have you seen Potato Head?


377
00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:16.341
What? No!

378
00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:20.971
Oh, dear. it seems the monster has
returned to claim one final victim.


379
00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.806
No, he hasn't. 
He's right over there.

380
00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:25.058
I'm so glad to have you back, baby.

381
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.519
We ain't never gonna
get separated again.


382
00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:29.396
Nuts.

383
00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:32.732
Group laughter.

384
00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:36.903
A sure sign that the worst is behind us
and the movie is just about over.


385
00:20:36.987 --> 00:20:38.738
So, this is the ending?

386
00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:42.534
Yes. I'd say they'd be
running the credits about now.


387
00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.999
Transport has arrived!

388
00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:51.585
You heard the cat. Let's move.

389
00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:56.923
Thanks, buddy.
Next stop, Billy's house.


390
00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:02.220
Mr. Jones!

391
00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:05.015
Here you go, buddy.

392
00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:08.268
Welcome to the Sleep Well.
How may I...


393
00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:09.603
Are you the manager?

394
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:13.356
Me? No, I'm not the manager.

395
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.151
I'll tell you what. 
I'll go get him for you.

396
00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:25.368
Told you not to leave
the keys in the car.


397
00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:31.875
We got a runner.
