1
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.080
I'm hungry.

2
00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.540
A lady
never complains.


3
00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.417
We can't
eat dresses.


4
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.463
If only the Duke
had sent bread.


5
00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.298
I think he wants
to marry you.


6
00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.008
I'd rather
marry you.


7
00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:51.677
He's a Duke.

8
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.430
And you, my dear,
a rapidly ageing orphan.


9
00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:57.182
Ah, Marie!

10
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.018
Well, I won't be rescued.
I'm not in distress.


11
00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:02.479
We have no money.
Not a bean.


12
00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.564
Your whole life,
our country has been at war...


13
00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:05.983
and everyone must make...
Everyone must make...


14
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.820
I don't love
the Duke de Guiche.


15
00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.113
Wear the dress
he sent.


16
00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:14.825
No. Red is vulgar,
and it reeks of lechery.


17
00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:15.993
Have you seen my shoes?

18
00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.661
If you don't love him...
Or even like him.


19
00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.497
Why did you accept his
invitation to the theater?


20
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.543
Because we can't afford the
tickets, and I want to see the play.


21
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.463
He's here.

22
00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.924
He's here.

23
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:32.718
He's here.
Now, don't be rude to him.


24
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:34.052
I'm not rude.

25
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:37.055
I am enigmatically distant
and fashionably late.


26
00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:38.223
Where are my shoes?

27
00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:40.225
If you anger him,
he'll ruin us.


28
00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:42.144
Marry the Duke
and you'll be rich.


29
00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:44.062
A clever marriage
is your only option.


30
00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:46.023
I have no intention
of marrying anyone.


31
00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.692
Believe me,
spinsterhood is bleak.


32
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.236
And love,
does that mean nothing to you?


33
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.741
It might smell rosy for a year
or two, but love doesn't last.


34
00:01:55.824 --> 00:02:00.120
What lasts is compromise
and sacrifice.


35
00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.080
Children need love.

36
00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:03.498
Adults need money.

37
00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.254
Hello, Jacques.

38
00:02:09.338 --> 00:02:10.839
Marie. Marie.

39
00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.341
Tell your mistress she's two
months behind with the rent.


40
00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:13.717
It's coming, I promise.

41
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.177
Two months!

42
00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.263
Marie!

43
00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.185
It's perfectly fetching.

44
00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:25.979
I just long to see you
in crimson silk.


45
00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:27.940
-I couldn't wear that dress.
-Oh?


46
00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:30.108
I don't have
the shoes to match. Sorry.


47
00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:33.070
Oh, I'll rectify
your errant shoelessness.


48
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.365
Maybe the good Duke should've
send you the dress, Valvert.


49
00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:38.450
Oh, no, I tried it.

50
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.535
It was too loose
on the bust.


51
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.456
At least you have
more than one pair of shoes.


52
00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.626
<i>What does it feel like</i>

53
00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.712
<i>To slow dance in sunlight</i>

54
00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:54.716
<i>With someone you love?</i>

55
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.554
<i>Somebody who sees you</i>

56
00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:02.557
<i>And won't ever leave you</i>

57
00:03:02.641 --> 00:03:08.397
<i>Alone</i>
<i>Whatever comes</i>


58
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.233
<i>I need something</i>
<i>to die for</i>


59
00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.486
<i>Write poems and cry for</i>

60
00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.407
<i>And I won't be ashamed</i>

61
00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.245
<i>I'm nobody's pet</i>

62
00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:26.873
<i>No one's wife</i>
<i>no one's woman</i>


63
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.419
<i>And I won't play that game</i>

64
00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:36.341
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say</i>


65
00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:39.886
<i>That they can't live</i>
<i>without me</i>


66
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.222
<i>And they'll be there forever</i>

67
00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:48.353
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say to me</i>


68
00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:52.190
<i>That no matter</i>
<i>how bad it gets</i>


69
00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:56.445
<i>They won't turn away from me</i>

70
00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.907
<i>What do you do</i>

71
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:04.036
<i>When you're</i>
<i>always waiting</i>


72
00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.623
<i>To find love</i>
<i>at first sight?</i>


73
00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.462
<i>If I'm naive</i>

74
00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:17.174
<i>Why does all the poetry</i>

75
00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:20.427
<i>Say that I might?</i>

76
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.182
<i>I have heard</i>
<i>songs that say</i>


77
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.268
<i>Love conquers everything</i>

78
00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:31.438
<i>However you name it</i>

79
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.027
<i>It's right there</i>
<i>in front of you</i>


80
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.238
<i>Wherever you are</i>

81
00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:43.116
<i>You just have to claim it</i>
<i>Claim it</i>


82
00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:01.843
Who's that?

83
00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.011
The Duke de Guiche.

84
00:05:03.095 --> 00:05:04.596
Second only
to the King.


85
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.764
No, the lady.

86
00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.849
Oh, Roxanne.

87
00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:10.143
Well above your station,
my friend.


88
00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:16.900
Oh, what superb ribbons,
Duke de Guiche.


89
00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.236
Gorgeous piping.
And trim.


90
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.696
Doeskin and
beaver, ladies.


91
00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.114
Doeskin and beaver.

92
00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:26.618
Yes, thank you.

93
00:05:26.702 --> 00:05:27.703
Stop there, sir.

94
00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:31.415
In you go, sir.

95
00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.050
...sir.

96
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.642
Be swift,
be crafty...


97
00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:52.894
take from the women
and the men without swords.


98
00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:53.979
And children?

99
00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.566
A child
with a full purse is an adult.


100
00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.278
- <i>I'd give anything for</i>
-<i>someone to say</i>


101
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.196
<i>For someone to say</i>

102
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.742
<i>That they can't live</i>
<i>without me</i>


103
00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:09.286
<i>And they'll be there forever</i>

104
00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:15.125
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say to me</i>


105
00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:18.920
-<i>That no matter That no matter</i>
-<i>how bad it gets</i>


106
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:22.633
<i>They won't</i>
<i>turn away from me</i>


107
00:06:24.927 --> 00:06:30.515
- <i>If love's there,
I'll feel</i> -<i>it and its stare</i>


108
00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.936
<i>It'll be freedom</i>
<i>at first sight</i>


109
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:37.147
<i>I'll be walking on air</i>

110
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.944
<i>If love's there</i>
<i>won't dare run away</i>


111
00:06:42.778 --> 00:06:46.448
<i>I'll swallow my pride</i>

112
00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:49.409
<i>And I'll ask</i>

113
00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.957
<i>You to stay</i>

114
00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:15.978
Thief!

115
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.231
Hey!

116
00:07:19.815 --> 00:07:21.191
Stop that boy!

117
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:23.652
Hey! Stop him!

118
00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:29.700
Play! Play! Play!

119
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:30.826
Play! Play! Play!
Play! Play!


120
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.494
Play! Play! Play!

121
00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:39.376
Have you seen Cyrano?

122
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:40.877
Not yet.

123
00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:48.260
Would you like an orange?
Yeah?


124
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.855
Play! Play! Play!

125
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.023
Theater.

126
00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:03.567
Inhale it, my boy.
Literally.


127
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.277
Can you feel it? Yes?

128
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.946
Tonight you will see
the magnificent Montfleury...


129
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.449
the greatest actor
of his generation.


130
00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:00.540
Montfleury.

131
00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:01.875
Him?

132
00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.715
Montfleury!

133
00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:11.009
Bravo! Bravo!

134
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:21.561
Happy is he who, far from court
and Society's sway...


135
00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:24.898
in isolation
self-imposed...


136
00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.192
shuns company.

137
00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:28.568
And who...

138
00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:32.656
when the soft wind
whistles wishingly...


139
00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:35.284
Montfleury, what are you
doing here?


140
00:09:35.367 --> 00:09:36.451
Cyrano?

141
00:09:36.535 --> 00:09:37.744
Cyrano?
Yes.


142
00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.746
After your performance
last week...


143
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.292
I sent you a letter
urging you to retire.


144
00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.544
Cyrano.

145
00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:49.131
Happy is he who,
far from court and Society's...


146
00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:51.300
Did you receive my letter?

147
00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:54.845
Yes, I received
your letter, and I burnt it.


148
00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:57.556
I am
a professional actor.


149
00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.890
Yes, you are!
Bravo!


150
00:09:58.974 --> 00:10:00.684
I've received
numerous prizes.


151
00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:01.935
He has.

152
00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:04.605
I have performed at court
for the King himself.


153
00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:05.689
Indeed, you have.
Yes!


154
00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:07.482
Yes.

155
00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:11.778
I have been successfully
entertaining the people for over three decades.


156
00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:16.783
And now I will act!

157
00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:18.035
Act! Act! Act!
Act! Act! Act!


158
00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:19.494
Act! Act! Act!

159
00:10:19.578 --> 00:10:20.621
Act!

160
00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.123
Happy he who shuns...

161
00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.958
Final warning!

162
00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:28.253
In insulting me,
you insult the dramatic muse.


163
00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:32.424
And worse, you...
you desecrate this theater...


164
00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:36.053
this crucible
of human...


165
00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.430
humanity.

166
00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:39.598
Hear, hear!

167
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.726
This sacred wooden O.

168
00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.729
No, sir. Untrue.

169
00:10:45.812 --> 00:10:48.231
I'm sorry, but you lie.

170
00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:53.528
You've made this stage
your personal sty!


171
00:10:53.612 --> 00:10:55.989
The dramatic muse
has fled the building.


172
00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:59.368
She scampered off when you
started gilding the lily...


173
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:02.412
with your great big voice.

174
00:11:07.793 --> 00:11:10.462
The poor muse
had no choice.


175
00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:14.925
I love this place
and all it means.


176
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:17.970
Poetry, romance,
terror, truth.


177
00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:21.139
I've loved it here
since early youth.


178
00:11:21.223 --> 00:11:23.558
Can't stand aside
while you dishonor it...


179
00:11:23.642 --> 00:11:26.228
with your pumping and
your hideous jigs.


180
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:28.188
I will not abide
your thumping...


181
00:11:28.272 --> 00:11:31.024
and, er, dreadful wigs.

182
00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.028
Montfleury, you've
abandoned the truth.


183
00:11:35.112 --> 00:11:36.488
You've lost your core.

184
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.199
You don't remember how truth
feels or what it's for.


185
00:11:39.283 --> 00:11:42.202
So, now leave this stage,
never to return.


186
00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:46.039
And I'll applaud the new
integrity you'll earn.


187
00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:48.500
Exit, Montfleury.

188
00:11:53.964 --> 00:11:56.675
I'm not moving one
step from the center of this stage.


189
00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.594
I am necessary.

190
00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:02.764
If you will not leave by
invitation, then I am compelled to use force.


191
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.059
Help! Help me, someone!

192
00:12:06.143 --> 00:12:07.227
Protect me!

193
00:12:07.311 --> 00:12:08.770
Arrest him! Help!

194
00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:10.856
Please! Help me!

195
00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:14.026
-Please, Cyrano. Please. Will anyone here defend
-this great sausage?


196
00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:18.864
I will duel with any
volunteer...


197
00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:21.366
with all the honor commensurate
to his station.


198
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.452
Is anyone
willing to fight for Montfleury?


199
00:12:23.535 --> 00:12:25.370
You are no Samson.

200
00:12:25.454 --> 00:12:28.624
I am no Goliath either, but I
fight like the two combined.


201
00:12:28.707 --> 00:12:29.875
I think not.

202
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.169
Goliath was a giant.

203
00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.962
Care to think again?

204
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.466
No volunteers?

205
00:12:37.549 --> 00:12:39.259
You came here to see
Montfleury...


206
00:12:39.343 --> 00:12:41.136
and yet you're
not willing to fight for him?


207
00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:43.764
Montfleury...
Sir, please.


208
00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:47.184
I will count to three, and you
will exit stage right hurriedly.


209
00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.352
Please.

210
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.062
One...
Do something.


211
00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.272
Two...
Think of the play.


212
00:12:52.356 --> 00:12:53.649
Three!

213
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.528
Ladies and gentlemen,
please.


214
00:13:08.205 --> 00:13:11.124
Jodelet!
I came to see a play!


215
00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:12.918
We paid
to see a play!


216
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:16.088
And I have
saved you from seeing a fiasco!


217
00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:18.090
I paid
to see Montfleury!


218
00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:20.050
Yes, what
about their money?


219
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.593
Always the money.

220
00:13:21.677 --> 00:13:22.678
Here.

221
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:29.434
Oh, at this price, sir, you can
close the theaters every night.


222
00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:32.688
Ladies and gentlemen, you will
be refunded in full at the door.


223
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:33.939
Dinner?

224
00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.400
Oh, I'd love to.
But no money.


225
00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:37.985
You had
a full bag of coins.


226
00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.696
All donated to the
long-suffering patrons of this theater.


227
00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.781
-How will you eat? The gesture is more
-than the meal.


228
00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.116
You.

229
00:13:45.784 --> 00:13:47.995
You're a freak.

230
00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:52.249
The insult is antique,
but I accept it.


231
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:55.877
Freak.

232
00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.131
Is that it?

233
00:13:59.214 --> 00:14:01.967
Have you exhausted your
dictionary of scorn?


234
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.803
Who is this savage who dares to
present himself in public...


235
00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:08.640
without ribbons,
bows or braids?


236
00:14:10.142 --> 00:14:11.977
I am not au courant,
it's true.


237
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.897
But think of my deeds as my
ribbons, my humor as a bow.


238
00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:18.734
Oh, do pipe down,
or else you'll drown.


239
00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:20.736
In verbosity.

240
00:14:20.819 --> 00:14:22.904
A fellow poet.

241
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:25.574
Pleasure to meet you.
Cyrano de Bergerac.


242
00:14:47.596 --> 00:14:49.848
I accept your challenge.

243
00:14:49.932 --> 00:14:52.225
I'll make
short work of this.


244
00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:56.688
Isn't he a hoot?

245
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.028
A palpable miss.

246
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.364
It's hard to
hit a target quite so small.


247
00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:07.491
The man is
barely four feet tall.


248
00:15:10.118 --> 00:15:13.205
-<i>Sir, when I was born</i>
<i>The nurses laughed</i> -<i>hysterically</i>


249
00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:16.249
<i>They'd never seen anything</i>
<i>quite like me, apparently</i>


250
00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:19.336
<i>I'll never forget it</i>
<i>I can still hear them joking</i>


251
00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:22.631
<i>One said, "My goodness,</i>
<i>what has God been smoking?"</i>


252
00:15:22.714 --> 00:15:25.884
<i>From when I was born</i>
<i>I learned to control my tears</i>


253
00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:29.763
<i>When they carried me home</i>
<i>through town I left a trail of broken mirrors</i>


254
00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.890
<i>Yes, when children see me</i>
<i>They scream and run away</i>


255
00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:35.560
-<i>You're absolutely
right Halloween's my favorite</i> -<i>holiday</i>


256
00:15:35.644 --> 00:15:37.229
<i>I am a monster</i>
<i>I am a mutant</i>


257
00:15:37.312 --> 00:15:38.772
<i>A freak of nature</i>

258
00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:42.276
<i>I've heard all the hateful</i>
<i>ugly nomenclature</i>


259
00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.569
<i>Can't you see</i>

260
00:15:44.653 --> 00:15:47.906
<i>I'm much more</i>
<i>than you think</i>


261
00:15:49.324 --> 00:15:52.911
<i>I've heard it all</i>
<i>so many times</i>


262
00:15:53.537 --> 00:15:55.080
You are a disgrace!

263
00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:59.710
<i>Everybody knows</i>
<i>I'm so much more than a freak</i>


264
00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:03.255
<i>If you wanna try to hurt me</i>

265
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.758
<i>You better get in line</i>

266
00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:08.468
<i>You just have to say it</i>
<i>Can't you see</i>


267
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:10.387
<i>I get it, it makes sense</i>

268
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.763
-<i>He's much more than you
think When you have</i> -<i>your kind of talent</i>


269
00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:13.223
<i>For clever vicious comments</i>

270
00:16:13.307 --> 00:16:14.850
<i>My heart's not even angry</i>
<i>He's heard it all</i>


271
00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:16.435
<i>It's just the way it breaks</i>
<i>So many times</i>


272
00:16:16.518 --> 00:16:18.270
<i>And don't be</i>
<i>so tough on God</i>


273
00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:20.272
<i>Everybody makes mistakes</i>

274
00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.107
-<i>Yes, one sight of me
could make a statue cry</i> -<i>Everybody knows</i>


275
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.483
<i>He's so much more</i>
<i>Guess what else</i>


276
00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:24.610
<i>When bluebirds land on me</i>
<i>Than a freak</i>


277
00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:26.111
<i>They shit themselves</i>
<i>and die</i>


278
00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:27.487
<i>If you wanna try</i>
<i>Whichever way I look at you</i>


279
00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:29.573
<i>To hurt him</i>
<i>Can't find a tasteful side</i>


280
00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:30.699
-<i>A specimen like you</i>
<i>belongs in formaldehyde</i> -<i>You better get in line</i>


281
00:16:32.576 --> 00:16:33.952
<i>Yes, what you've heard</i>
<i>is true</i>


282
00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:35.537
<i>I am not a rumor</i>

283
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:39.207
<i>I'm living proof that</i>
<i>God has a sick sense of humor</i>


284
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.845
Cyrano! Cyrano! Cyrano!

285
00:16:51.929 --> 00:16:52.971
Shh!

286
00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:56.975
Cyrano!

287
00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.797
Yes. It all goes in.

288
00:17:28.966 --> 00:17:30.801
And God, how it hurts.

289
00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:46.817
He went too far.

290
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.487
Valvert insulted him, and then
challenged him to a duel.


291
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.573
Valvert is a Comte,
and in my retinue.


292
00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:58.704
I guarantee you
Cyrano took no pleasure from it.


293
00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.205
You know him?

294
00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:01.581
They're from
the same town...


295
00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:03.750
-in the south west. Cyrano is
-my oldest friend.


296
00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:07.838
It would be to your advantage
to end the friendship.


297
00:18:10.007 --> 00:18:13.552
Roxanne,
I won't wait forever.


298
00:18:16.847 --> 00:18:18.682
Did I miss a proposal?

299
00:18:18.765 --> 00:18:21.226
Oh, don't push your luck,
pretty thing.


300
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.853
Don't do that.

301
00:18:27.024 --> 00:18:29.234
How about
a drinking song?


302
00:18:29.318 --> 00:18:30.944
Like soldiers do.

303
00:18:31.028 --> 00:18:32.237
We're better
than that.


304
00:18:32.321 --> 00:18:33.488
At least, I am.

305
00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:35.866
May I ask you
a question?


306
00:18:36.867 --> 00:18:37.951
Anything.

307
00:18:38.035 --> 00:18:39.244
It's a little
personal.


308
00:18:40.203 --> 00:18:41.997
I have no secrets
from you.


309
00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.001
Are you in love?

310
00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:49.171
Whatever gave you
that idea?


311
00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:50.505
See, I knew
you wouldn't like it.


312
00:18:50.589 --> 00:18:51.673
Do I seem offended?

313
00:18:51.757 --> 00:18:53.717
No. But your
guard is up.


314
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.303
It's just some things
are private.


315
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.892
What gave me
that idea...


316
00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.227
was your performance
at the theater today.


317
00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:09.524
I sensed you were playing to one
particular member of the audience.


318
00:19:09.608 --> 00:19:10.817
Oh, who?

319
00:19:10.901 --> 00:19:12.819
Let's not continue
this charade.


320
00:19:12.903 --> 00:19:14.363
If you want
to unburden, fine.


321
00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:16.448
If you don't,
that's fine, too.


322
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:20.911
Yes.

323
00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:24.039
Yes.

324
00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:26.375
Yes.

325
00:19:29.795 --> 00:19:31.254
I am in love.

326
00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:36.927
I dare.

327
00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:43.642
My sole purpose on this Earth
is to love Roxanne.


328
00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:55.279
Do you feel better now?

329
00:19:56.113 --> 00:19:57.572
Do you?

330
00:19:59.032 --> 00:20:03.495
<i>Have you ever wanted</i>
<i>something</i>


331
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.916
<i>So badly</i>
<i>you cannot breathe</i>


332
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:14.298
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>loved someone</i>


333
00:20:16.842 --> 00:20:18.927
<i>Madly</i>

334
00:20:20.262 --> 00:20:22.472
No, I don't think
I have.


335
00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.434
Isn't she magnificent?

336
00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:27.686
She is,
though perhaps a little vain.


337
00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.354
Yes, but
magnificently so.


338
00:20:29.438 --> 00:20:31.356
There's some pretension
in there, too.


339
00:20:32.065 --> 00:20:33.525
She's full of it.

340
00:20:33.609 --> 00:20:35.235
I wasn't sure about
her hair today.


341
00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:36.445
Agreed.

342
00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:40.699
But even
her imperfections are perfect.


343
00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:48.332
In our little town,
back in the day...


344
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:52.961
she was practically
worshipped.


345
00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:59.217
To some
she was notorious.


346
00:20:59.301 --> 00:21:02.054
To me, glorious.

347
00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:03.388
Does she know?

348
00:21:03.472 --> 00:21:04.932
Do you think a person
of her beauty...


349
00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:07.851
in mind, body, and soul
doesn't know about it?


350
00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:10.646
I mean, does she know
that you're in love with her?


351
00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:11.730
No.

352
00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:13.857
No.

353
00:21:13.941 --> 00:21:16.485
No. Someone like me
supposing to love perfection?


354
00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:17.819
No. If I confessed...

355
00:21:18.654 --> 00:21:19.863
she'd never see me again.

356
00:21:19.947 --> 00:21:21.740
You don't have
a very high opinion of her.


357
00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:23.241
What? She's the Alps.

358
00:21:23.325 --> 00:21:25.661
No, but you don't think
she has the depth...


359
00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:26.912
to look beyond your...
Careful.


360
00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.288
...unique physique.
Not bad.


361
00:21:28.372 --> 00:21:29.748
Thank you.

362
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.291
To love you for who you are
and not for how you look.


363
00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:32.668
Yes, but
don't you see?


364
00:21:32.751 --> 00:21:34.836
I am simply
not worthy of her.


365
00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:40.759
<i>I've held my breath</i>
<i>since I saw her</i>


366
00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:42.844
<i>I've tried to look away</i>
<i>but I can't resist</i>


367
00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:52.521
<i>I know</i>
<i>every detail of her</i>


368
00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:54.398
<i>I made a list</i>

369
00:21:57.776 --> 00:22:00.320
<i>I can't tell you how long</i>

370
00:22:00.404 --> 00:22:03.448
<i>I've thought about her</i>

371
00:22:03.532 --> 00:22:07.244
<i>I've kept everything</i>
<i>she's missed</i>


372
00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:11.623
<i>She's gonna</i>
<i>laugh at the one</i>


373
00:22:11.707 --> 00:22:16.628
<i>That brings her love</i>
<i>like this</i>


374
00:22:20.424 --> 00:22:25.178
<i>Have you ever wanted</i>
<i>something</i>


375
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.601
<i>So badly</i>
<i>you cannot breathe</i>


376
00:22:31.727 --> 00:22:35.897
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>loved someone</i>


377
00:22:37.774 --> 00:22:39.901
<i>Madly</i>

378
00:22:39.985 --> 00:22:43.905
When you were fighting Valvert,
she was anxious.


379
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:46.658
Oh, she turned
quite pale.


380
00:22:46.742 --> 00:22:48.910
Her lips trembled.

381
00:22:48.994 --> 00:22:50.329
They parted.

382
00:22:50.412 --> 00:22:51.455
She touched
her heart.


383
00:22:52.372 --> 00:22:53.665
You should tell her.

384
00:22:53.749 --> 00:22:54.833
You love her.

385
00:22:54.916 --> 00:22:57.919
No. My fate
is to love her from afar.


386
00:22:59.296 --> 00:23:01.548
To confess is to shatter
the beautiful dream.


387
00:23:01.632 --> 00:23:03.300
You forget,
I've seen you in battle.


388
00:23:03.383 --> 00:23:04.718
You're a fighter
to the end.


389
00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:06.678
But in love you've raised
the white flag.


390
00:23:06.762 --> 00:23:08.680
Have faith in her.
Tell her the truth.


391
00:23:08.764 --> 00:23:09.765
A word.

392
00:23:12.476 --> 00:23:14.853
Roxanne wishes to meet
with you alone.


393
00:23:14.937 --> 00:23:15.938
What?

394
00:23:16.021 --> 00:23:17.314
Why?

395
00:23:17.397 --> 00:23:19.399
She won't say,
no matter how much I berate her.


396
00:23:19.483 --> 00:23:20.525
But she says
it's urgent.


397
00:23:20.609 --> 00:23:21.693
Take me to her at once.

398
00:23:21.777 --> 00:23:23.695
Not now,
you vulgar person. At night?


399
00:23:24.488 --> 00:23:26.031
Then when?

400
00:23:26.114 --> 00:23:27.783
She'll go to early Mass
tomorrow.


401
00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:30.118
After she leaves the church,
she'll meet with you.


402
00:23:30.202 --> 00:23:33.538
Somewhere discreet,
she said it must be private.


403
00:23:33.622 --> 00:23:36.875
I'll thank you, Captain Le Bret,
to lower that eyebrow.


404
00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:38.752
There is nothing
unseemly here.


405
00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:40.963
I bow to your expertise
in the matter.


406
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.465
A venue, please.

407
00:23:46.802 --> 00:23:49.137
I've never seen him silent
before, it's quite appealing.


408
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.806
Let me think.

409
00:23:50.889 --> 00:23:52.224
Where?
I'm thinking where.


410
00:23:52.307 --> 00:23:53.976
Where?
Ragueneau's.


411
00:23:54.059 --> 00:23:55.435
Seven o'clock.
She'll be there.


412
00:23:55.519 --> 00:23:56.520
I will, too.

413
00:23:57.062 --> 00:23:58.063
And so will I.

414
00:23:58.146 --> 00:23:59.147
Good night.

415
00:24:03.652 --> 00:24:04.987
She wants to
see me privately.


416
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.196
There it is.

417
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.281
Alone.

418
00:24:08.323 --> 00:24:10.534
Oh, no.
I cannot succumb to hope!


419
00:24:10.617 --> 00:24:12.077
Hope is madness.
Hope is hell.


420
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.245
Hope is life!

421
00:24:13.328 --> 00:24:15.289
Oh, I need an army
to vanquish!


422
00:24:15.372 --> 00:24:17.249
I have ten hearts,
I have twenty arms.


423
00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:19.167
I could kill
a hundred men.


424
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:20.544
Good night, my friend.

425
00:24:20.627 --> 00:24:22.087
And good luck tomorrow.

426
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.464
This could be it.

427
00:24:24.548 --> 00:24:26.008
Oh, have faith.

428
00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:28.635
Where are you off to,
this late hour?


429
00:24:28.719 --> 00:24:30.637
Some things
are private.


430
00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:32.347
Thank you for dinner.

431
00:24:34.558 --> 00:24:39.187
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>loved someone</i>


432
00:24:39.271 --> 00:24:41.648
<i>Madly</i>

433
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.130
Well, I'd hoped
to fight 100, but ten will do.


434
00:26:38.974 --> 00:26:40.058
Morning, Ragueneau.

435
00:26:40.142 --> 00:26:41.393
Cyrano! Just the man!

436
00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:42.561
What time is it?

437
00:26:42.644 --> 00:26:43.729
Almost 6:00.

438
00:26:43.812 --> 00:26:45.856
I'm up with the muse,
so to speak.


439
00:26:45.939 --> 00:26:49.067
A poem.
Her soul eludes me.


440
00:26:49.151 --> 00:26:51.153
Needs your expert ear.

441
00:26:51.236 --> 00:26:54.072
I'm told you have
a private room.


442
00:26:54.156 --> 00:26:56.783
I mean, a room where two people
can have some privacy.


443
00:26:56.867 --> 00:26:58.160
Bit early
for an assignation.


444
00:26:58.243 --> 00:27:00.912
I mean talk privately
without interruption.


445
00:27:00.996 --> 00:27:02.164
I'll show you.

446
00:27:02.247 --> 00:27:04.875
Simultaneously,
I'll recite what I have so far.


447
00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:08.420
The poem is entitled
"Constellation."


448
00:27:08.503 --> 00:27:09.546
Good, eh?

449
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.631
Terrific.

450
00:27:16.803 --> 00:27:18.180
Dear Roxanne.

451
00:27:20.057 --> 00:27:21.350
Dear Roxanne.

452
00:27:26.188 --> 00:27:31.818
<i>Every morning</i>
<i>at the break of light</i>


453
00:27:31.902 --> 00:27:36.365
<i>I see you standing</i>
<i>in the sun</i>


454
00:27:37.658 --> 00:27:43.997
<i>You look at me with</i>
<i>the kindest eyes</i>


455
00:27:44.081 --> 00:27:48.168
<i>Every morning</i>
<i>I'm overcome</i>


456
00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:50.837
"My heavenly earthly desire."

457
00:27:52.547 --> 00:27:54.341
Heavenly earthly, eh?

458
00:27:54.424 --> 00:27:55.425
How's this?

459
00:27:57.636 --> 00:27:59.388
Something more private?

460
00:27:59.471 --> 00:28:01.473
I understand.
Discretion.


461
00:28:01.556 --> 00:28:03.100
Now...

462
00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:07.562
"Jupiter and Pluto are planets,
revolving like us, far apart."


463
00:28:07.646 --> 00:28:13.652
<i>Sorrow and glory and</i>
<i>blinding euphoria</i>


464
00:28:13.735 --> 00:28:17.739
<i>Everything's there</i>
<i>in your name</i>


465
00:28:17.823 --> 00:28:20.909
"May I woo you
with my art."


466
00:28:22.828 --> 00:28:24.663
Good.
That's it thus far.


467
00:28:24.746 --> 00:28:26.832
There's a long way to go,
but be brutal.


468
00:28:26.915 --> 00:28:29.126
Do you think the planetary
metaphor holds?


469
00:28:34.423 --> 00:28:36.174
Perhaps consider sublimation.

470
00:28:36.258 --> 00:28:37.259
Right.

471
00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:39.636
A different pattern
of imagery.


472
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.597
Maybe something
you know intimately.


473
00:28:42.973 --> 00:28:44.766
Anything in mind?

474
00:28:45.475 --> 00:28:47.019
<i>Baking?</i>

475
00:28:47.102 --> 00:28:51.523
Sensuality and longing expressed
through the act of baking.


476
00:28:51.607 --> 00:28:52.691
<i>Why not?</i>

477
00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:54.359
<i>Rising dough.</i>

478
00:28:54.443 --> 00:28:56.778
<i>Flour. Ovens.</i>

479
00:28:56.862 --> 00:28:57.904
<i>Heat.</i>

480
00:28:57.988 --> 00:28:59.531
Oh, my God.
Thank you.


481
00:29:00.157 --> 00:29:01.158
Thank you!

482
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.330
Thank you!

483
00:29:09.875 --> 00:29:15.464
<i>In darkness when</i>
<i>I close my eyes</i>


484
00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:19.509
<i>I see your hair come undone</i>

485
00:29:21.303 --> 00:29:27.434
<i>I lose myself every time</i>

486
00:29:27.517 --> 00:29:31.355
<i>Even now I'm overcome</i>

487
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:39.488
<i>Roxanne, what am I</i>
<i>supposed to say?</i>


488
00:29:39.571 --> 00:29:44.576
<i>Words are only</i>
<i>glass on a string</i>


489
00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.454
<i>The more I arrange them</i>

490
00:29:47.537 --> 00:29:51.083
<i>And line up</i>
<i>and change them</i>


491
00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:55.003
<i>The more they mean</i>
<i>the same thing</i>


492
00:29:57.381 --> 00:29:58.924
<i>Roxanne</i>

493
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.843
<i>Roxanne</i>

494
00:30:03.345 --> 00:30:05.180
<i>Roxanne</i>

495
00:30:09.184 --> 00:30:10.602
Roxanne!

496
00:30:10.686 --> 00:30:11.979
Roxanne.

497
00:30:19.695 --> 00:30:21.029
Do you like
rabbit stew?


498
00:30:21.113 --> 00:30:22.614
I loathe rabbits.

499
00:30:22.698 --> 00:30:24.783
I hate their taste, and I hate
the way they savage a garden.


500
00:30:24.866 --> 00:30:25.951
Shank of lamb?

501
00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:27.286
She likes tongue.

502
00:30:29.329 --> 00:30:31.623
For heaven's sake,
Marie.


503
00:30:31.707 --> 00:30:33.166
Go and eat.

504
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.501
Fine.

505
00:30:34.584 --> 00:30:36.878
And I'll pray
for your sins while I do.


506
00:30:39.548 --> 00:30:41.675
A huge slab of tongue.
Keep it coming.


507
00:30:41.758 --> 00:30:43.051
Righto.

508
00:30:45.804 --> 00:30:48.765
I have a confession
to make.


509
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.186
Shall we sit?

510
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.354
You're wounded.

511
00:30:54.438 --> 00:30:55.439
A scratch.

512
00:30:56.565 --> 00:30:58.150
I know your shoddy work.

513
00:30:58.233 --> 00:31:00.360
The dressing is loose.

514
00:31:00.444 --> 00:31:01.695
Your confession?

515
00:31:01.778 --> 00:31:02.946
Can wait a moment.

516
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.364
It's only a scratch.

517
00:31:04.448 --> 00:31:07.826
It's a wound,
and it needs cleaning.


518
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:10.287
I've been wounded
many times.


519
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:12.164
This is not a wound.

520
00:31:12.247 --> 00:31:14.333
Then we'll call it
a cut.


521
00:31:14.416 --> 00:31:15.667
"Scratch" is
more accurate.


522
00:31:15.751 --> 00:31:17.836
I dispute "more."

523
00:31:17.919 --> 00:31:20.088
A thing is either accurate
or it isn't.


524
00:31:21.632 --> 00:31:23.258
There are no degrees
of accuracy.


525
00:31:24.092 --> 00:31:25.677
You taught me that.

526
00:31:25.761 --> 00:31:27.137
As you wish.

527
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.639
I'll settle
for "cut."


528
00:31:29.473 --> 00:31:31.266
A deep one.

529
00:31:35.312 --> 00:31:36.521
How did you get it?

530
00:31:36.605 --> 00:31:38.357
Last night.
A duel.


531
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.566
And look what happens.

532
00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.026
You should see
the other guys.


533
00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:42.402
I'm not impressed
by your swordsmanship.


534
00:31:42.486 --> 00:31:43.654
Oh, I know.

535
00:31:43.737 --> 00:31:46.698
Or rather,
I know you pretend you're not.


536
00:31:46.782 --> 00:31:49.034
I'd be very angry with you
if you died.


537
00:31:49.117 --> 00:31:50.160
Only angry?

538
00:31:50.243 --> 00:31:51.787
Incandescent.

539
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.205
This might hurt.

540
00:31:55.791 --> 00:31:57.042
So brave.

541
00:31:58.877 --> 00:32:00.712
Will you make
your confession?


542
00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:02.005
Yes, I must.

543
00:32:02.089 --> 00:32:04.675
And there's only so much tongue
Marie can chew on.


544
00:32:14.518 --> 00:32:16.061
I feel shy.

545
00:32:23.068 --> 00:32:24.236
Never mind.

546
00:32:27.823 --> 00:32:30.075
Yesterday,
at the theater...


547
00:32:30.158 --> 00:32:31.159
Yes?

548
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.289
I can barely believe
I'm saying this.


549
00:32:35.372 --> 00:32:40.335
I realized,
or became aware, suddenly...


550
00:32:41.545 --> 00:32:43.088
that I was in love.

551
00:32:43.171 --> 00:32:44.548
I see.

552
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:47.634
I am madly in love, but the man
in question has no idea.


553
00:32:47.718 --> 00:32:49.469
And I don't know
how to tell him.


554
00:32:49.553 --> 00:32:51.346
Perhaps he
feels the same?


555
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.265
It's possible.
I have hopes.


556
00:32:53.348 --> 00:32:55.100
How do you know
you love him?


557
00:32:55.183 --> 00:32:57.477
Because it's as if
I've always known.


558
00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.771
Always known him.

559
00:32:59.855 --> 00:33:01.440
He was always there...

560
00:33:01.523 --> 00:33:03.233
but this intense romantic
connection had not yet manifested.


561
00:33:03.317 --> 00:33:05.402
I understand.

562
00:33:05.485 --> 00:33:06.778
Supposing it's
all a delusion?


563
00:33:06.862 --> 00:33:08.113
No, you're
clearly in love.


564
00:33:08.196 --> 00:33:09.489
My mind is racing.
I'm feverish.


565
00:33:09.573 --> 00:33:10.616
-Would you like some water?
-No.


566
00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:11.992
It's got your
blood in it.


567
00:33:12.075 --> 00:33:13.660
-You were saying? I don't know what
-I was saying.


568
00:33:13.744 --> 00:33:15.954
Tell me about him. It might
reassure you there's no delusion.


569
00:33:16.038 --> 00:33:17.122
Yes.

570
00:33:18.206 --> 00:33:19.207
Good.

571
00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:24.212
I feel
he is rather proud.


572
00:33:29.051 --> 00:33:31.136
And very charming.

573
00:33:31.219 --> 00:33:35.515
He is mysterious,
but not obscure.


574
00:33:35.599 --> 00:33:38.977
And his face
is so bright with intelligence.


575
00:33:39.061 --> 00:33:40.062
What else?

576
00:33:42.689 --> 00:33:45.150
He's very beautiful,
obviously.


577
00:33:45.233 --> 00:33:46.902
Is he?

578
00:33:46.985 --> 00:33:49.655
Yes. But his natural modesty
means he's completely unaware of it.


579
00:33:49.738 --> 00:33:51.073
I've met people
like that.


580
00:33:51.156 --> 00:33:52.324
They are so rare.
Yes.


581
00:33:52.407 --> 00:33:54.284
Perhaps I could make
a confession, too?


582
00:33:54.368 --> 00:33:55.702
Yes, but I haven't
made mine yet.


583
00:33:55.786 --> 00:33:57.287
I'm sorry.
Please continue.


584
00:33:57.371 --> 00:33:58.622
This man I love
is a guard.


585
00:33:58.705 --> 00:33:59.790
In your regiment.

586
00:33:59.873 --> 00:34:01.291
Of course he is.
Of course?


587
00:34:01.375 --> 00:34:02.459
In the sense that...

588
00:34:02.542 --> 00:34:05.170
I interrupted.
Please continue.


589
00:34:05.253 --> 00:34:09.007
It's embarrassing to admit, but
I've never actually spoken to him.


590
00:34:09.091 --> 00:34:11.551
Of your love?
Of anything.


591
00:34:11.635 --> 00:34:13.011
It was
love at first sight.


592
00:34:13.095 --> 00:34:14.721
A thunderbolt.
It's madness.


593
00:34:14.805 --> 00:34:15.889
Fantastical.

594
00:34:15.973 --> 00:34:18.642
And yet
it's absolutely...


595
00:34:19.935 --> 00:34:20.936
real.

596
00:34:30.737 --> 00:34:31.905
Cyrano?
Here.


597
00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.116
-You seem... Just the wound
-playing up.


598
00:34:35.158 --> 00:34:36.285
Poor you.

599
00:34:37.452 --> 00:34:39.121
I have some ointment
at home.


600
00:34:44.459 --> 00:34:48.755
Supposing he's
an idiot.


601
00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:52.551
He might just be
an incredibly beautiful man...


602
00:34:52.634 --> 00:34:54.303
with the mind
of a rabbit.


603
00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:58.140
Except he isn't.

604
00:35:00.183 --> 00:35:01.643
He can't be.

605
00:35:02.644 --> 00:35:04.229
I need him
not to be.


606
00:35:08.483 --> 00:35:12.529
Anyway, I've made
some discreet inquiries...


607
00:35:12.613 --> 00:35:15.073
and I am told that
he is Christian.


608
00:35:15.157 --> 00:35:16.241
Christian Neuvillette.

609
00:35:16.325 --> 00:35:18.243
"Neuvillette"?
Never heard of him.


610
00:35:18.327 --> 00:35:20.037
He's a new recruit.

611
00:35:20.662 --> 00:35:22.039
He starts today.

612
00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:27.794
To the point.

613
00:35:29.046 --> 00:35:30.505
To your presence
here...


614
00:35:32.883 --> 00:35:35.135
I know how the guards treat
the new recruits...


615
00:35:35.218 --> 00:35:37.971
your ancient
initiation rituals and so on.


616
00:35:38.055 --> 00:35:40.265
So, please,
will you protect him?


617
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:42.100
I can refuse you nothing.

618
00:35:42.184 --> 00:35:43.560
And never let him
fight a duel?


619
00:35:43.644 --> 00:35:44.728
No.

620
00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:46.104
And guard his life
with your own?


621
00:35:46.188 --> 00:35:47.272
Yes.

622
00:35:47.356 --> 00:35:48.815
And be his friend?

623
00:35:48.899 --> 00:35:50.692
I might not like him.

624
00:35:50.776 --> 00:35:53.153
All the same.
Befriend him.


625
00:35:53.236 --> 00:35:54.279
Yes.

626
00:35:54.363 --> 00:35:56.073
And make him
write to me.


627
00:35:56.823 --> 00:35:58.575
And I'll write back.

628
00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:01.161
We'll exchange long,
poetic love letters.


629
00:36:01.244 --> 00:36:02.621
I will suggest that
he write to you...


630
00:36:02.704 --> 00:36:05.457
but I cannot control the content
or length of his letters.


631
00:36:08.043 --> 00:36:09.711
You are always so kind.

632
00:36:16.718 --> 00:36:17.719
No.

633
00:36:19.805 --> 00:36:22.266
You said you have a confession
to make, too.


634
00:36:24.226 --> 00:36:25.727
It's not important.

635
00:36:25.811 --> 00:36:27.396
I will support you
as you've supported me.


636
00:36:27.479 --> 00:36:29.106
Really, it's nothing.

637
00:36:31.275 --> 00:36:32.651
How's the hand?

638
00:36:32.734 --> 00:36:33.819
Painless.

639
00:36:33.902 --> 00:36:35.487
A scratch.

640
00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:37.823
How many men
did you duel with last night?


641
00:36:37.906 --> 00:36:39.199
A hundred.

642
00:36:39.283 --> 00:36:40.575
Really?

643
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:42.286
Ten.

644
00:36:44.496 --> 00:36:47.040
All the same,
what courage.


645
00:36:50.585 --> 00:36:52.254
I've done better since.

646
00:36:55.757 --> 00:36:58.218
And one, two, three.

647
00:36:58.302 --> 00:37:01.513
One, two, three.
One, two, three.


648
00:37:01.597 --> 00:37:04.683
One, two, three.
One, two, three.


649
00:37:04.766 --> 00:37:07.769
One, two, three.
One, two, three.


650
00:37:07.853 --> 00:37:10.856
One, two, three.
One, two, three.


651
00:37:10.939 --> 00:37:12.691
One, two, three.

652
00:37:12.774 --> 00:37:16.236
And one, two. One, two.

653
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.614
One, two. One, two.

654
00:37:18.697 --> 00:37:21.199
One, two. One, two.

655
00:37:21.283 --> 00:37:23.076
One, two, three.

656
00:37:23.994 --> 00:37:25.454
Captain.

657
00:37:27.289 --> 00:37:30.459
I heard of your recent
adventures.


658
00:37:30.542 --> 00:37:33.211
I've come to express
my admiration.


659
00:37:33.295 --> 00:37:34.338
Cyrano.

660
00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:40.552
I'm inviting you
to join my retinue.


661
00:37:40.636 --> 00:37:45.140
I thank the Duke for his
generous offer, but I must decline.


662
00:37:45.891 --> 00:37:47.559
Carry on!

663
00:37:47.643 --> 00:37:50.103
There are a great many
advantages to following me.


664
00:37:50.187 --> 00:37:51.271
I know.

665
00:37:51.355 --> 00:37:54.733
But I follow no one.

666
00:37:54.816 --> 00:37:59.112
I'm told that you write poetry
in common with a great many men these days.


667
00:37:59.196 --> 00:38:02.741
However, I'm told that you write
poetry uncommonly well.


668
00:38:02.824 --> 00:38:05.452
I like to publish those
that I admire.


669
00:38:05.535 --> 00:38:08.080
I could put you into print,
distinguish you.


670
00:38:08.163 --> 00:38:10.457
I'd only change a few lines.
I pay handsomely.


671
00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.752
You could buy a fine pair of
calfskin gloves.


672
00:38:13.835 --> 00:38:15.587
I'm not for sale.
Neither is my work.


673
00:38:15.671 --> 00:38:17.589
Aren't you proud.
Aren't you observant.


674
00:38:17.673 --> 00:38:19.591
Take this seriously.

675
00:38:19.675 --> 00:38:21.677
Those men last night
were incompetent.


676
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.387
Others may not be.

677
00:38:25.222 --> 00:38:26.765
Someone's taken
against you.


678
00:38:26.848 --> 00:38:29.935
Join my retinue,
you'll be protected.


679
00:38:30.018 --> 00:38:32.437
First, you try to recruit me,
then you try to buy me.


680
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:34.690
When you learn
I have no price...


681
00:38:34.773 --> 00:38:38.235
you warn me that my life is
threatened by an unknown enemy.


682
00:38:38.318 --> 00:38:39.861
I saw you last night.

683
00:38:39.945 --> 00:38:41.905
The blood of those men
is on your hands.


684
00:38:41.989 --> 00:38:44.283
You're a tyrant
posing as a noble.


685
00:38:44.366 --> 00:38:46.785
Oh, what a shame
we can't accommodate each other.


686
00:38:46.868 --> 00:38:48.453
'Cause you know something?

687
00:38:48.537 --> 00:38:51.164
You'd make a sweet little
companion to the acquisition I will make.


688
00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:52.791
Roxanne.

689
00:38:54.751 --> 00:38:55.961
Guards!

690
00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.090
<i>Don't push him too far.</i>

691
00:39:00.173 --> 00:39:02.551
To be his enemy
is a badge of honor.


692
00:39:02.634 --> 00:39:03.927
Which might
get you killed.


693
00:39:04.011 --> 00:39:05.095
Let him try.

694
00:39:05.178 --> 00:39:07.055
I'll best any he sends.

695
00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:08.181
Let them come.

696
00:39:08.265 --> 00:39:09.641
He offered you
a good wage.


697
00:39:09.725 --> 00:39:10.809
I belong here.

698
00:39:10.892 --> 00:39:12.978
With you. With them.

699
00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:16.064
Left! Left! Left! Right! Left!

700
00:39:16.148 --> 00:39:18.650
<i>I will not be his toy.</i>

701
00:39:18.734 --> 00:39:20.569
What would you
have me do, Le Bret?


702
00:39:21.403 --> 00:39:22.988
Join his retinue?

703
00:39:23.071 --> 00:39:24.156
No, thank you.

704
00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:26.825
<i>Dedicate poems</i>
<i>to de Guiche?</i>


705
00:39:26.908 --> 00:39:28.076
<i>No, thank you.</i>

706
00:39:35.626 --> 00:39:36.918
I've heard
how this works.


707
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.921
Who's first?

708
00:39:44.927 --> 00:39:47.304
Do you want me
to swallow insults?


709
00:39:47.387 --> 00:39:49.681
To crawl? To kneel?
To beg?


710
00:39:49.765 --> 00:39:51.767
Play both sides?
Flatter? No, thank you.


711
00:39:53.644 --> 00:39:56.188
<i>Live for other people's</i>
<i>opinions of me?</i>


712
00:39:56.271 --> 00:39:59.191
No, thank you. I prefer a
different life. My own.


713
00:39:59.274 --> 00:40:02.027
I answer to no one,
and I am content, thank you.


714
00:40:04.488 --> 00:40:05.614
She doesn't love you?

715
00:40:07.491 --> 00:40:08.575
Don't...

716
00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:09.952
ever say it.

717
00:40:11.954 --> 00:40:13.664
Who's next?

718
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:16.792
I am.

719
00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:18.460
Cyrano!

720
00:40:21.672 --> 00:40:25.759
Cyrano! Cyrano! Cyrano!

721
00:40:27.594 --> 00:40:29.221
What's so funny?

722
00:40:29.304 --> 00:40:32.224
First, I fight an elephant, and
now a mole?


723
00:40:33.433 --> 00:40:35.143
What's your name?

724
00:40:35.227 --> 00:40:36.436
Why?

725
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.690
I just like to know
the names of the men I kill.


726
00:40:42.317 --> 00:40:44.987
I'm Christian Neuvillette, sir.

727
00:40:47.864 --> 00:40:49.157
Embrace me.

728
00:40:51.535 --> 00:40:52.703
Sir!

729
00:40:56.081 --> 00:40:57.332
I'm her brother.

730
00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.384
Whose brother?

731
00:41:07.467 --> 00:41:08.844
Who do you think?

732
00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:10.053
Roxanne.
Roxanne?


733
00:41:10.137 --> 00:41:11.179
Hmm.

734
00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:14.474
Yes.

735
00:41:14.558 --> 00:41:15.851
You don't look
like her brother.


736
00:41:15.934 --> 00:41:17.936
We're old friends,
like siblings but not.


737
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.104
We're very close.

738
00:41:19.187 --> 00:41:20.439
And what...
She's told me everything.


739
00:41:20.522 --> 00:41:22.274
The theater,
love at first sight, all of it.


740
00:41:22.357 --> 00:41:23.567
She loves me?

741
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.027
She believes so.

742
00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.570
Sir, I am so glad
to know you!


743
00:41:26.653 --> 00:41:27.904
Yes, enough of that.

744
00:41:27.988 --> 00:41:29.281
-Please forgive me for insulting you earlier.
-Yes.


745
00:41:29.364 --> 00:41:30.365
I just...
Yes, yes.


746
00:41:30.449 --> 00:41:32.284
She loves me!
Now, listen.


747
00:41:32.367 --> 00:41:33.744
She loves me!

748
00:41:33.827 --> 00:41:35.495
Roxanne wants
a letter from you.


749
00:41:36.747 --> 00:41:37.789
No?
Impossible.


750
00:41:37.873 --> 00:41:38.957
If I write to her,
it'll drive her away.


751
00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:40.125
Really? Why?

752
00:41:40.208 --> 00:41:41.209
I can't write
love letters.


753
00:41:41.293 --> 00:41:42.294
Rabbit.

754
00:41:42.377 --> 00:41:43.837
Sorry?

755
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.633
You just say
what you feel.


756
00:41:47.716 --> 00:41:50.218
As long as it's true,
you can't go wrong.


757
00:41:50.302 --> 00:41:53.597
But a woman
like Roxanne wants wit, romance.


758
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.974
Maybe even poetry.

759
00:41:56.058 --> 00:41:57.225
You're right.

760
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:59.478
You'd better leave town.

761
00:41:59.561 --> 00:42:00.562
Oh, I didn't mean it.

762
00:42:01.229 --> 00:42:02.272
I'm very confused.

763
00:42:02.356 --> 00:42:03.982
Are you here to help me
or hinder me?


764
00:42:04.066 --> 00:42:05.317
Help.
Good.


765
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.235
You see, in battle I have
inordinate courage.


766
00:42:07.319 --> 00:42:08.654
I can do anything.

767
00:42:08.737 --> 00:42:11.490
But with women,
my whole life I've been useless.


768
00:42:11.573 --> 00:42:13.075
Silent. I'm...

769
00:42:13.158 --> 00:42:15.327
What's the word for when you're
bad at expressing yourself?


770
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.037
Inarticulate.
That's it.


771
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.999
I can't explain what I feel,
not on paper, and not on paper.


772
00:42:21.083 --> 00:42:23.168
I don't know
how to speak romantically.


773
00:42:23.251 --> 00:42:25.003
Roxanne will be extremely
disappointed.


774
00:42:25.087 --> 00:42:26.171
She must not be.

775
00:42:26.254 --> 00:42:27.381
But I have no wit.

776
00:42:32.261 --> 00:42:33.428
Borrow mine.

777
00:42:36.974 --> 00:42:39.476
My words
upon your lips.


778
00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:40.644
I can't.
It's a lie.


779
00:42:40.727 --> 00:42:41.853
I'd be deceiving
the woman I love.


780
00:42:41.937 --> 00:42:43.188
It's better than
losing her.


781
00:42:43.272 --> 00:42:45.357
Call it a fantasy, call it a
dream, call it pretend.


782
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.818
A dream might be a lie,
but it's also true.


783
00:42:47.901 --> 00:42:48.944
Wait, what?

784
00:42:49.027 --> 00:42:51.363
Sometimes illusion
is kind.


785
00:42:51.446 --> 00:42:53.115
Is it?
I think so.


786
00:42:53.198 --> 00:42:54.866
Read a book or two.
You'll find out.


787
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:56.201
There's no need to
be patronizing.


788
00:42:56.285 --> 00:42:57.286
I'm sorry.

789
00:42:57.369 --> 00:42:58.370
Accepted.

790
00:42:58.453 --> 00:42:59.538
But will
the deceit work?


791
00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:01.206
Is the prize
not worth the risk?


792
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.708
Yes.

793
00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:04.126
Oh, Roxanne...

794
00:43:04.209 --> 00:43:05.585
Oh, Roxanne...

795
00:43:07.462 --> 00:43:10.465
will be so pleased
to receive your letter.


796
00:43:13.093 --> 00:43:15.596
May I ask,
why are you helping me?


797
00:43:16.638 --> 00:43:18.849
What can you gain?

798
00:43:18.932 --> 00:43:22.394
My words go to waste
unless spoken aloud.


799
00:43:22.477 --> 00:43:26.231
I will make you eloquent
while you make me handsome.


800
00:43:28.942 --> 00:43:34.406
<i>God, what I'd do to just be</i>
<i>able to tell her</i>


801
00:43:34.489 --> 00:43:37.618
<i>What it's like</i>
<i>when I see her</i>


802
00:43:41.163 --> 00:43:42.914
<i>It's something like</i>

803
00:43:42.998 --> 00:43:44.082
<i>Happiness</i>

804
00:43:44.166 --> 00:43:45.876
<i>It's something like</i>

805
00:43:45.959 --> 00:43:47.169
<i>Hunger</i>

806
00:43:47.252 --> 00:43:48.754
<i>And something like</i>

807
00:43:48.837 --> 00:43:51.089
<i>Fear</i>

808
00:43:51.173 --> 00:43:55.886
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say</i>


809
00:43:57.512 --> 00:44:00.349
<i>All the words</i>
<i>I don't have</i>


810
00:44:00.432 --> 00:44:03.435
<i>And I can't</i>
<i>put together</i>


811
00:44:03.518 --> 00:44:09.566
<i>I'd give anything for</i>
<i>someone to say to her</i>


812
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.445
<i>That she's all</i>
<i>I can think about</i>


813
00:44:13.528 --> 00:44:16.365
<i>And I can't live</i>
<i>without her</i>


814
00:44:32.297 --> 00:44:35.467
<i>My father told me</i>

815
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:42.557
<i>Letters and books</i>
<i>weren't meant for the son of a soldier</i>


816
00:44:44.893 --> 00:44:47.646
<i>Courage and steel</i>

817
00:44:47.729 --> 00:44:52.234
<i>The trials of the
real world are what matter</i>


818
00:44:52.317 --> 00:44:55.404
<i>And all that</i>
<i>should mold you</i>


819
00:44:57.239 --> 00:44:59.241
<i>God, what I'd do</i>

820
00:44:59.324 --> 00:45:03.036
<i>To have the one thing</i>
<i>that you have</i>


821
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.330
<i>That I never will</i>

822
00:45:08.917 --> 00:45:12.379
<i>You have something</i>
<i>worth giving</i>


823
00:45:12.462 --> 00:45:15.215
<i>A reason for living</i>

824
00:45:15.299 --> 00:45:16.800
<i>All I do well is...</i>

825
00:45:16.883 --> 00:45:17.884
<i>Kill</i>

826
00:45:19.511 --> 00:45:24.349
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say</i>


827
00:45:25.726 --> 00:45:28.854
<i>All the words I don't have</i>

828
00:45:28.937 --> 00:45:31.857
<i>And I can't put together</i>

829
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:36.987
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say to her</i>


830
00:45:38.322 --> 00:45:40.032
<i>That she's all</i>
<i>I can think about</i>


831
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:44.369
<i>And I can't</i>
<i>live without her</i>


832
00:45:44.453 --> 00:45:49.249
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say</i>


833
00:45:50.626 --> 00:45:54.004
<i>That they can't live</i>
<i>without me</i>


834
00:45:54.087 --> 00:45:56.840
<i>And they'll</i>
<i>be there forever</i>


835
00:45:56.924 --> 00:45:59.426
<i>I'd give anything</i>
<i>for someone to say to me</i>


836
00:46:03.096 --> 00:46:06.892
<i>That no matter</i>
<i>how bad it gets</i>


837
00:46:06.975 --> 00:46:10.812
<i>They won't</i>
<i>turn away from me</i>


838
00:46:15.817 --> 00:46:17.110
Here.

839
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.572
Just sign your name
on the bottom.


840
00:46:20.656 --> 00:46:22.199
Great.
When did you write it?


841
00:46:22.282 --> 00:46:23.492
A while ago.

842
00:46:23.575 --> 00:46:25.202
-But... I always have
-a letter in my pocket...


843
00:46:25.285 --> 00:46:27.037
written to
an imaginary woman.


844
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.580
It's the romantic
custom here.


845
00:46:28.664 --> 00:46:30.582
But don't you need to
make it specific to her?


846
00:46:30.666 --> 00:46:33.752
Count on vanity to make Roxanne
think it is only for her.


847
00:46:33.835 --> 00:46:36.380
But the letter itself is
applicable to all women?


848
00:46:36.463 --> 00:46:38.924
Not all.

849
00:46:39.007 --> 00:46:41.260
I'm convinced we're destined to
be friends for life.


850
00:46:41.343 --> 00:46:42.886
You think?

851
00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:44.513
The very best of friends.

852
00:46:58.193 --> 00:47:00.570
And I,
my heart will lend.


853
00:47:09.788 --> 00:47:10.872
Roxanne's?

854
00:47:11.581 --> 00:47:12.582
Thank you.

855
00:47:15.877 --> 00:47:17.379
WO
Come on, children. Hurry up.


856
00:47:57.919 --> 00:47:58.920
Roxanne...

857
00:48:03.091 --> 00:48:07.554
<i>The ink on the paper</i>
<i>makes me nervous</i>


858
00:48:07.638 --> 00:48:11.016
<i>I nearly lose my vision</i>

859
00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:18.190
<i>And then my breath</i>
<i>and my pulse and my mind quicken</i>


860
00:48:18.273 --> 00:48:21.860
<i>Head below my knees</i>
<i>I come alive</i>


861
00:48:21.944 --> 00:48:26.365
<i>With every stroke of
every letter in every line you write</i>


862
00:48:26.448 --> 00:48:29.409
<i>Keeps me awake</i>
<i>thinking back</i>


863
00:48:29.493 --> 00:48:34.957
<i>Oh, my first sight of you</i>
<i>was my first heart attack</i>


864
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.585
<i>Every letter makes me</i>
<i>lose my reason</i>


865
00:48:38.669 --> 00:48:40.087
<i>Every word is like</i>
<i>your kindest touch</i>


866
00:48:42.965 --> 00:48:46.510
<i>And if I told you</i>
<i>how much I need you</i>


867
00:48:46.593 --> 00:48:49.304
<i>Would you give me yourself</i>
<i>or turn and run?</i>


868
00:48:51.682 --> 00:48:55.519
<i>You light up desire</i>
<i>just by describing it</i>


869
00:48:55.602 --> 00:48:59.356
<i>I read to myself</i>
<i>until I go blind</i>


870
00:48:59.439 --> 00:49:03.735
<i>Your words fall around me</i>
<i>all through the night</i>


871
00:49:03.819 --> 00:49:06.905
<i>I can't resist</i>
<i>and I don't want to fight</i>


872
00:49:06.989 --> 00:49:08.782
<i>Will you be held?</i>

873
00:49:08.865 --> 00:49:10.534
<i>Will you be touched?</i>

874
00:49:10.617 --> 00:49:12.536
<i>By my hand</i>
<i>through this paper</i>


875
00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:14.746
<i>Is this all too much?</i>

876
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.790
<i>Will we be ravaged?</i>

877
00:49:16.873 --> 00:49:18.583
<i>Will we be true?</i>

878
00:49:18.667 --> 00:49:22.713
<i>To somebody perfect</i>
<i>somebody like you</i>


879
00:49:22.796 --> 00:49:24.756
<i>I'm tired</i>
<i>of yearning</i>


880
00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.758
<i>I'm tired</i>
<i>of learning</i>


881
00:49:26.842 --> 00:49:28.719
<i>I need to drink you</i>

882
00:49:28.802 --> 00:49:30.929
<i>My heart</i>
<i>has been burning</i>


883
00:49:31.013 --> 00:49:32.848
<i>Ever since I saw you</i>

884
00:49:32.931 --> 00:49:34.933
<i>Backwards through the glass</i>

885
00:49:35.017 --> 00:49:36.768
<i>Of a thin windowpane</i>

886
00:49:36.852 --> 00:49:38.812
<i>Like a thin</i>
<i>see-through mask</i>


887
00:49:38.895 --> 00:49:40.856
<i>These words are the truth</i>

888
00:49:40.939 --> 00:49:42.482
<i>Just let them sink in</i>

889
00:49:42.566 --> 00:49:45.110
<i>Through your</i>
<i>thin-fingered gloves</i>


890
00:49:45.193 --> 00:49:46.945
<i>To your hand, to your skin</i>

891
00:49:47.029 --> 00:49:48.947
<i>Like ribbons on wrist</i>

892
00:49:49.031 --> 00:49:50.949
<i>Let them hold you</i>
<i>and twist</i>


893
00:49:51.033 --> 00:49:53.201
<i>Let them</i>
<i>touch you all over</i>


894
00:49:53.285 --> 00:49:55.579
<i>Until you can't resist</i>

895
00:49:55.662 --> 00:49:59.249
- <i>Every letter makes me</i>
-<i>lose my reason</i>


896
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:03.587
<i>Every word is</i>
<i>like your kindest touch</i>


897
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:07.132
<i>And if I told you</i>
<i>how much I need you</i>


898
00:50:07.215 --> 00:50:11.136
<i>Would you give me yourself</i>
<i>or turn and run?</i>


899
00:50:11.219 --> 00:50:16.266
<i>Would you give me yourself</i>
<i>or turn and run?</i>


900
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:20.270
- <i>You light up desire</i>
-<i>just by describing it</i>


901
00:50:20.354 --> 00:50:24.232
<i>I read to myself</i>
<i>until I go blind</i>


902
00:50:24.316 --> 00:50:28.904
<i>Your words fall around me</i>
<i>all through the night</i>


903
00:50:28.987 --> 00:50:32.616
<i>I can't resist</i>
<i>and I don't wanna fight</i>


904
00:50:32.699 --> 00:50:34.076
<i>Dim the lights</i>

905
00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:36.328
<i>Give me everything I want</i>

906
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:40.457
<i>Just talk to me like you do</i>
<i>in your songs</i>


907
00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:44.503
<i>Your letters are drawings</i>
<i>on me from above</i>


908
00:50:44.586 --> 00:50:49.341
<i>I know who you are</i>
<i>And I know you are love</i>


909
00:50:49.424 --> 00:50:51.468
<i>Every day I think</i>
<i>I couldn't love him any more.</i>


910
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:53.512
Then a new letter arrives,
and my heart expands...


911
00:50:53.595 --> 00:50:55.097
to accommodate
more love.


912
00:51:02.562 --> 00:51:04.523
He understands me
instinctively.


913
00:51:04.606 --> 00:51:07.484
He knows exactly what I respond
to, what thrills me.


914
00:51:07.567 --> 00:51:08.652
It's uncanny.

915
00:51:08.735 --> 00:51:10.362
I'm pleased
for you.


916
00:51:10.445 --> 00:51:11.655
Are you really?

917
00:51:11.738 --> 00:51:13.198
Why wouldn't I be?

918
00:51:13.282 --> 00:51:15.701
It's quite tedious having to
listen to someone waxing on...


919
00:51:15.784 --> 00:51:17.286
about finding
true love.


920
00:51:23.458 --> 00:51:24.793
I wanted to
meet with him.


921
00:51:25.919 --> 00:51:27.462
In private.

922
00:51:28.797 --> 00:51:30.299
Can you arrange it?

923
00:51:31.633 --> 00:51:33.927
Would you love him
if he wasn't handsome?


924
00:51:35.637 --> 00:51:38.056
I cannot imagine it.

925
00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:42.185
He is beautiful, and he
expresses himself beautifully.


926
00:51:44.146 --> 00:51:45.939
It's perfectly logical.

927
00:51:48.317 --> 00:51:52.029
"The more you take of my heart,
the more I have to give.


928
00:51:52.112 --> 00:51:54.656
"Since I need a heart
to long for you...


929
00:51:56.116 --> 00:51:59.244
"keep mine
and send me yours."


930
00:51:59.328 --> 00:52:02.956
First he has too much heart,
and then not enough?


931
00:52:03.498 --> 00:52:04.583
You're jealous.

932
00:52:04.666 --> 00:52:05.751
Me?

933
00:52:05.834 --> 00:52:07.252
It's fascinating.

934
00:52:07.336 --> 00:52:09.254
You're both brilliant,
but exact opposites in style.


935
00:52:10.505 --> 00:52:12.966
Christian is overt...

936
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.135
passionate...

937
00:52:15.218 --> 00:52:16.261
fiery.

938
00:52:16.345 --> 00:52:17.679
Whereas I?

939
00:52:18.221 --> 00:52:19.848
You are coded...

940
00:52:21.516 --> 00:52:22.601
witty...

941
00:52:22.684 --> 00:52:23.685
rueful.

942
00:52:24.645 --> 00:52:26.146
"Coded"?

943
00:52:26.229 --> 00:52:28.607
His words aren't better than
yours, just differently put.


944
00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:30.734
But both are
endlessly quotable.


945
00:52:30.817 --> 00:52:32.069
You know his letters
by heart?


946
00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:36.531
Every one.

947
00:52:40.535 --> 00:52:42.454
You will arrange
the meeting?


948
00:52:42.537 --> 00:52:45.707
As ever,
I am at your service.


949
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:56.176
I've come
to say goodbye.


950
00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.720
I leave tonight
for the front.


951
00:52:58.804 --> 00:53:00.681
It's grim,
but orders are orders.


952
00:53:01.848 --> 00:53:03.558
We're losing the war.

953
00:53:03.642 --> 00:53:06.353
They've promoted
the nobility to turn it around.


954
00:53:06.436 --> 00:53:09.856
As you can see,
they've made me a colonel.


955
00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:11.775
Me.

956
00:53:11.858 --> 00:53:15.153
Shows how desperate
they are.


957
00:53:15.237 --> 00:53:17.656
Does this new rank put you
in command of the guards?


958
00:53:17.739 --> 00:53:20.492
It does.
Cyrano is mine.


959
00:53:20.575 --> 00:53:22.494
And the guards
are being sent to the front?


960
00:53:22.577 --> 00:53:24.496
Naturally.
They're in my regiment.


961
00:53:24.579 --> 00:53:25.622
All of them?

962
00:53:25.706 --> 00:53:26.707
Of course.

963
00:53:32.879 --> 00:53:35.507
Why so upset,
dear lady?


964
00:53:35.591 --> 00:53:36.758
You are
going to war.


965
00:53:37.884 --> 00:53:39.636
You might die.

966
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.263
You are leaving tonight.

967
00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:43.348
I am beside myself.

968
00:53:43.432 --> 00:53:47.436
Can I take this
as a sign of your affection?


969
00:53:49.271 --> 00:53:50.856
I must tell you.

970
00:53:50.939 --> 00:53:53.317
Cyrano and I
are no longer friends.


971
00:53:53.942 --> 00:53:56.194
Oh?

972
00:53:56.278 --> 00:53:59.239
I ended the friendship,
as you counseled.


973
00:53:59.323 --> 00:54:00.407
Good.

974
00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:04.536
I know how
you could make him suffer.


975
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:05.912
Oh?

976
00:54:05.996 --> 00:54:10.417
Why don't you leave him
and all the guards behind?


977
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.712
Here in the city
with the women and children.


978
00:54:13.795 --> 00:54:15.631
Oh, he'll hate that.

979
00:54:15.714 --> 00:54:18.884
More than hate,
it would humiliate him.


980
00:54:18.967 --> 00:54:21.887
No heroics, no medals.

981
00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:24.640
His warrior pride
is his great weakness.


982
00:54:24.723 --> 00:54:29.436
Am I to understand
this as an act of love?


983
00:54:31.355 --> 00:54:32.481
It is.

984
00:54:34.816 --> 00:54:38.278
I hereby bury his orders
to the front.


985
00:54:39.947 --> 00:54:41.740
Poor little Cyrano...

986
00:54:41.823 --> 00:54:43.450
and his
poor little friends.


987
00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:49.456
Marie, some tea.

988
00:54:52.292 --> 00:54:54.211
I'm afraid we are
out of tea, sir.


989
00:54:54.294 --> 00:54:55.671
Leave us.

990
00:55:06.598 --> 00:55:09.476
I like your tricks.

991
00:55:11.603 --> 00:55:13.397
I wager
you know some more.


992
00:55:13.981 --> 00:55:15.065
No, sir.

993
00:55:15.148 --> 00:55:16.608
Oh, I think you do.

994
00:55:16.692 --> 00:55:18.527
How can I leave you?

995
00:55:19.695 --> 00:55:21.196
Maybe I won't.

996
00:55:22.155 --> 00:55:23.490
Roxanne...

997
00:55:25.867 --> 00:55:27.619
I love you.

998
00:55:27.703 --> 00:55:29.162
I love you.

999
00:55:30.706 --> 00:55:32.958
It's a terrible shame,
but leave you must.


1000
00:55:33.041 --> 00:55:34.960
The battle
can't happen...


1001
00:55:35.043 --> 00:55:36.253
without the colonel.

1002
00:55:39.506 --> 00:55:41.508
I so admire
your bravery.


1003
00:55:41.592 --> 00:55:42.801
Yeah, I'm not brave.

1004
00:55:42.884 --> 00:55:45.095
I'm dutiful.
You are too modest.


1005
00:55:45.178 --> 00:55:47.598
It is you who will lead
the charge into battle.


1006
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:52.686
I could not love a man
who hides from danger.


1007
00:55:52.769 --> 00:55:54.563
Do you love me?

1008
00:55:56.189 --> 00:55:58.609
I love the man
for whom I fear.


1009
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:03.447
So I must go to war?

1010
00:56:06.825 --> 00:56:07.826
Yes.

1011
00:56:23.258 --> 00:56:24.843
This is folly.

1012
00:56:24.927 --> 00:56:26.595
She said she wants to meet me,
so what's wrong with surprising her?


1013
00:56:26.678 --> 00:56:27.804
You're not prepared.

1014
00:56:27.888 --> 00:56:29.014
She loves me,
I don't need to prepare.


1015
00:56:29.097 --> 00:56:30.766
Why can't you relax?

1016
00:56:30.849 --> 00:56:32.309
Can you at least take a look at
these conversational witticisms?


1017
00:56:32.392 --> 00:56:33.477
No, thank you.

1018
00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.770
Memorize this now!

1019
00:56:34.853 --> 00:56:36.313
I'm going to
speak to her in my own words.


1020
00:56:36.396 --> 00:56:38.565
I strongly advise
against that.


1021
00:56:38.649 --> 00:56:40.692
And when the moment is right,
I'll take her in my arms.


1022
00:56:40.776 --> 00:56:43.195
There will be no moment
if you don't study these.


1023
00:56:43.278 --> 00:56:44.780
I'll be fine.

1024
00:56:44.863 --> 00:56:47.032
All your fancy words and phrases
are now a part of my vocabulary.


1025
00:56:47.115 --> 00:56:48.700
I'll simply repeat them.

1026
00:56:48.784 --> 00:56:49.868
No, wait, what is it?

1027
00:56:49.952 --> 00:56:51.036
Regurgitate?

1028
00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:52.788
That's it!
That's what I will do.


1029
00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:54.957
Off you go then.

1030
00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.720
I'm very grateful
for your help...


1031
00:57:08.804 --> 00:57:11.473
but, with extreme respect, I
don't think I need you anymore.


1032
00:57:12.057 --> 00:57:13.058
Very well.

1033
00:57:14.893 --> 00:57:16.603
Fly to Roxanne.

1034
00:57:16.687 --> 00:57:19.439
Dazzle her with your
transcendent words.


1035
00:57:22.859 --> 00:57:23.860
Yeah.

1036
00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:36.248
WO Can you imagine?

1037
00:57:37.457 --> 00:57:38.709
Champagne!

1038
00:58:03.859 --> 00:58:06.403
- <i>"We don't write poems</i>
-<i>to be happy.</i>


1039
00:58:06.486 --> 00:58:08.405

"We write to revenge loss

1044
00:58:32.888 --> 00:58:34.389
Christian.

1045
00:58:36.058 --> 00:58:37.225
Hello.

1046
00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:40.103
How did you know
I was here?


1047
00:58:40.187 --> 00:58:44.483
Which is not to say that I
flatter myself by thinking you are here to see me.


1048
00:58:44.566 --> 00:58:45.817
I heard about this...

1049
00:58:45.901 --> 00:58:47.069
Women's-only salon?

1050
00:58:49.237 --> 00:58:51.239
Yes. From a friend.

1051
00:58:52.157 --> 00:58:53.283
Is she here?

1052
00:58:53.367 --> 00:58:54.493
No, she's a man.

1053
00:58:54.576 --> 00:58:55.994
I mean, he is.

1054
00:58:59.247 --> 00:59:01.166
Will you come with me?

1055
00:59:01.249 --> 00:59:02.751
So we can talk?

1056
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:06.421
Of course.

1057
00:59:13.428 --> 00:59:14.763
Isn't it beautiful?

1058
00:59:19.434 --> 00:59:21.353
Do you suffer
from vertigo?


1059
00:59:21.436 --> 00:59:23.272
No. But I don't
like heights.


1060
00:59:44.626 --> 00:59:48.046
There are some silences
that are comfortable...


1061
00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:51.717
and then there are some
that are freighted with tension.


1062
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.386
What do you think
the nature of this one is?


1063
00:59:58.015 --> 01:00:01.560
I think it's
a bit of both.


1064
01:00:02.477 --> 01:00:03.562
I agree.

1065
01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:11.486
Talk to me.

1066
01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:14.740
I love you.

1067
01:00:14.823 --> 01:00:15.866
Yes.

1068
01:00:17.868 --> 01:00:24.958
Sometimes raw, simple words are
the most potent deployment of language.


1069
01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:26.126
I love you.

1070
01:00:26.209 --> 01:00:29.004
The sheer surprise
of repetition.


1071
01:00:29.755 --> 01:00:31.673
But say some more.

1072
01:00:31.757 --> 01:00:32.883
What else?

1073
01:00:34.343 --> 01:00:36.345
I love you so much.

1074
01:00:40.057 --> 01:00:42.809
When you write, you say it in a
thousand different ways...


1075
01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:48.440
without ever resorting to those
three overused little words.


1076
01:00:48.523 --> 01:00:50.275
Which little words?

1077
01:00:50.359 --> 01:00:54.279
Please,
my dearest Christian...


1078
01:00:54.363 --> 01:00:57.866
speak to me
like you do in your letters.


1079
01:01:01.787 --> 01:01:05.457
You are an angel
to be adored.


1080
01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:10.045
My love is
so, so big...


1081
01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:14.299
it is absord.

1082
01:01:14.383 --> 01:01:16.176
I'm sorry?

1083
01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.220
You are
a beautiful flower.


1084
01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:21.265
May I smell your neck?

1085
01:01:22.391 --> 01:01:26.561
Or give it a peck
at this violet hour?


1086
01:01:26.645 --> 01:01:29.147
Neuvillette, sir.

1087
01:01:29.231 --> 01:01:30.315
Don't go!
Please wait.


1088
01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:31.650
My passion has
rendered me...


1089
01:01:31.733 --> 01:01:32.943
What is it?
Stupid?


1090
01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:34.194
No, but it does
begin with an "S."


1091
01:01:34.278 --> 01:01:36.113
Let me know when
you've found it.


1092
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.283
And I am not a flower.

1093
01:01:39.908 --> 01:01:41.034
I need more.

1094
01:01:41.118 --> 01:01:42.494
I need more.

1095
01:01:42.577 --> 01:01:43.745
I need more.

1096
01:01:49.584 --> 01:01:53.505

1098

1100
01:02:05.684 --> 01:02:06.852
Speechless!

1101
01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:08.437
That's the word.

1102
01:02:16.278 --> 01:02:17.529
That went well.

1103
01:02:17.613 --> 01:02:18.989
You spied on us?

1104
01:02:20.282 --> 01:02:22.075
I couldn't resist.

1105
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:24.077
Help me.

1106
01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:25.704
Please.

1107
01:02:25.787 --> 01:02:27.331
No.

1108
01:02:28.165 --> 01:02:31.251
You don't need me.

1109
01:02:31.335 --> 01:02:35.088
<i>Talk of the blank space</i>

<i>in the loveliest way</i>


1115
01:02:52.648 --> 01:02:56.568
<i>Infinite and simple</i>
<i>in an ink black sky</i>


1116
01:02:56.652 --> 01:03:00.572
<i>Turn me to water</i>
<i>like your letters do</i>


1117
01:03:00.656 --> 01:03:04.743
<i>Make me not know</i>
<i>whether to laugh or cry</i>


1118
01:03:04.826 --> 01:03:08.872
<i>I need more</i>

1119
01:03:08.956 --> 01:03:10.832
<i>I need more</i>

1120
01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:15.754
<i>I need waves of desire</i>
<i>to come over me</i>


1121
01:03:15.837 --> 01:03:19.925
<i>And teardrops</i>
<i>on the floor</i>


1122
01:03:20.008 --> 01:03:24.930
-<i>I feel like I've
been too long</i> -<i>with my thoughts anyway</i>


1123
01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:28.767
<i>I've cornered myself</i>
<i>in the loneliest place</i>


1124
01:03:28.850 --> 01:03:33.105
<i>I won't let you lose me</i>
<i>now that you've found me</i>


1125
01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:37.109
<i>You know what to say</i>
<i>so just say it now to me</i>


1126
01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:40.946
<i>I float through the hours</i>
<i>with everyone else</i>


1127
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:45.242
<i>But I always only</i>
<i>think of you by myself</i>


1128
01:03:45.325 --> 01:03:48.078
<i>Tell me your secrets</i>
<i>Who are you in private?</i>


1129
01:03:48.161 --> 01:03:49.621
Oh.

1130
01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:53.709
<i>When you can't sleep</i>
<i>tell me how you survive it</i>


1131
01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:57.671
<i>I need more</i>

1132
01:03:57.754 --> 01:03:59.673
<i>I need more</i>

1133
01:03:59.756 --> 01:04:04.678
<i>I need waves of desire</i>
<i>to come over me</i>


1134
01:04:04.761 --> 01:04:07.889
<i>And teardrops</i>
<i>on the floor</i>


1135
01:04:07.973 --> 01:04:09.266
Help me. I beg you.

1136
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:10.934
If I don't win her back,
I'll die.


1137
01:04:11.018 --> 01:04:13.186
Then you'd better
improve your regurgitation skills.


1138
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:15.647
All right,
I need you.


1139
01:04:15.731 --> 01:04:18.066
I was an idiot to believe I
didn't. I apologize.


1140
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:19.818
You need me?
Always.


1141
01:04:19.901 --> 01:04:21.737
Am I essential?
Of course.


1142
01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.655
Will you say my words without
pedantry, prevarication, or quibbling?


1143
01:04:27.618 --> 01:04:28.702
Just say yes.

1144
01:04:28.785 --> 01:04:29.911
Yes.

1145
01:04:29.995 --> 01:04:31.455
Good. Follow me.

1146
01:04:32.414 --> 01:04:36.501
<i>I need more</i>

1147
01:04:36.585 --> 01:04:38.211
<i>I need more</i>

1148
01:04:38.295 --> 01:04:43.508
<i>Don't you dare tell me</i>
<i>you love me</i>


1149
01:04:43.592 --> 01:04:47.387
<i>I've heard that line before</i>

1150
01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:50.933
<i>I've heard that line before</i>

1151
01:04:51.016 --> 01:04:53.685
<i>I need more</i>

1152
01:04:53.769 --> 01:04:55.103
Right. Now, you stand there.

1153
01:04:55.812 --> 01:04:57.439
And I will be here.

1154
01:04:57.522 --> 01:04:59.566
And when she returns, I will
whisper what you must say to her.


1155
01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:01.234
No.

1156
01:05:01.318 --> 01:05:03.570
Yes.
I will feed you the words.


1157
01:05:03.654 --> 01:05:05.614
It's madness!
How can it possibly work?


1158
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:10.619
Do not
ruin this again.


1159
01:05:24.508 --> 01:05:25.884
Roxanne.

1160
01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:27.469
Roxanne.

1161
01:05:32.808 --> 01:05:33.976
Who's there?

1162
01:05:34.059 --> 01:05:35.602
Speechless Christian.

1163
01:05:35.686 --> 01:05:37.354
I must talk to you.

1164
01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:39.731
I'd rather
read your letters.


1165
01:05:39.815 --> 01:05:41.400
Please.

1166
01:05:41.483 --> 01:05:44.278
Do you regret
what happened this evening?


1167
01:05:44.361 --> 01:05:45.821
Yes.

1168
01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:47.364
Yes?

1169
01:05:49.324 --> 01:05:52.077
That's your considered
explanation and apology?


1170
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.579
I'm beginning to fear
you're just a weird young man...


1171
01:05:54.663 --> 01:05:56.915
who likes writing letters.

1172
01:05:56.999 --> 01:05:58.542
Maybe you don't even
love me.


1173
01:05:59.543 --> 01:06:01.003
Good night.

1174
01:06:02.254 --> 01:06:03.297
Wait.

1175
01:06:05.882 --> 01:06:07.467
I could no more
stop loving you...


1176
01:06:07.551 --> 01:06:09.595
I could no more
stop loving you...


1177
01:06:09.678 --> 01:06:11.388
...than I could
stop the sun rising.


1178
01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:13.265
...than I can
stop the sun rising.


1179
01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:16.184
Really?

1180
01:06:16.268 --> 01:06:19.938
My cruel love has never stopped
growing in my soul...


1181
01:06:20.022 --> 01:06:21.773
From the day
it was born there.


1182
01:06:21.857 --> 01:06:23.191
...from the day
it was born.


1183
01:06:24.318 --> 01:06:25.902
There.
There.


1184
01:06:27.195 --> 01:06:30.616
If your love is cruel,
you should have killed it.


1185
01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:32.367
I tried.

1186
01:06:32.451 --> 01:06:35.829
-It has the strength of Hercules. I tried.
-It has the strength of...


1187
01:06:35.912 --> 01:06:37.039
Hercules.

1188
01:06:37.122 --> 01:06:38.624
...Hercules.

1189
01:06:38.707 --> 01:06:39.750
Got anything better?

1190
01:06:41.126 --> 01:06:44.463
Do continue. Please.

1191
01:06:44.546 --> 01:06:47.132
Roxanne, my love for you
is so powerful...


1192
01:06:47.215 --> 01:06:50.802
Roxanne, my love for you
is so powerful...


1193
01:06:50.886 --> 01:06:52.471
...it has strangled
the two serpents...


1194
01:06:52.554 --> 01:06:54.681
...it has strangled
the two serpents...


1195
01:06:55.724 --> 01:06:57.059
pride and doubt.

1196
01:06:59.728 --> 01:07:01.229
Why do you speak
so haltingly?


1197
01:07:02.773 --> 01:07:03.982
This is impossible.

1198
01:07:04.066 --> 01:07:05.442
No, it's working,
keep going.


1199
01:07:05.525 --> 01:07:07.402
Are you going to
answer my question?


1200
01:07:11.323 --> 01:07:13.408
My speech seems halting...

1201
01:07:13.492 --> 01:07:18.163
because in this darkness my
words must stumble to your ear.


1202
01:07:18.246 --> 01:07:19.498
What are you doing?

1203
01:07:19.581 --> 01:07:21.833
My words have no such
difficulty.


1204
01:07:21.917 --> 01:07:24.002
Your words fall,
mine must climb.


1205
01:07:24.086 --> 01:07:27.172
Then perhaps
I should come down to you.


1206
01:07:27.255 --> 01:07:28.340
No.
No.


1207
01:07:30.634 --> 01:07:32.844
Why not?

1208
01:07:32.928 --> 01:07:35.472
I like this way
of talking.


1209
01:07:35.555 --> 01:07:37.724
I like being invisible
to each other.


1210
01:07:39.393 --> 01:07:43.563
I cannot be stunned into silence
by your beauty.


1211
01:07:43.647 --> 01:07:48.277
Here in this awkwardness, I am
free at last to speak from my heart.


1212
01:07:49.278 --> 01:07:51.363
Why is your voice
an octave lower?


1213
01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:57.369
I'm daring
to be myself.


1214
01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:03.166
Why would you fear
to be yourself?


1215
01:08:04.126 --> 01:08:05.127
To be laughed at.

1216
01:08:05.752 --> 01:08:07.004
For what?

1217
01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.925
For having
too much emotion.


1218
01:08:12.009 --> 01:08:13.010
I do not look...

1219
01:08:14.303 --> 01:08:16.179
Speak as I feel.

1220
01:08:17.639 --> 01:08:19.641
<i>The way I feel is like</i>

1221
01:08:21.643 --> 01:08:24.938
<i>Falling stars</i>

1222
01:08:25.022 --> 01:08:31.236
<i>Diving into</i>
<i>cold ocean waves</i>


1223
01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:37.576
<i>Words can only</i>
<i>get me so far</i>


1224
01:08:37.659 --> 01:08:40.704
<i>But they cannot describe</i>

1225
01:08:40.787 --> 01:08:43.248
<i>The way that it hurts</i>

1226
01:08:44.333 --> 01:08:48.545
<i>'Cause every time</i>
<i>I see you</i>


1227
01:08:48.629 --> 01:08:53.759
<i>I am overcome</i>

1228
01:08:54.676 --> 01:08:57.262
<i>I try to tell you</i>

1229
01:08:57.346 --> 01:09:00.766
<i>Tell you</i>
<i>how much I need you</i>


1230
01:09:03.352 --> 01:09:06.688
<i>But I turn and run</i>

1231
01:09:09.983 --> 01:09:16.114
<i>Your letters to me</i>
<i>are like music</i>


1232
01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:22.120
<i>They're just a mask in a</i>
<i>lonely coward's game</i>


1233
01:09:22.204 --> 01:09:28.752
<i>What is it</i>
<i>you're so afraid of losing?</i>


1234
01:09:28.835 --> 01:09:36.134
-<i>That I might lose everything</i>
-<i>if I lose the pain</i>


1235
01:09:36.218 --> 01:09:40.389
- <i>'Cause every time</i>
-<i>I see you</i>


1236
01:09:40.472 --> 01:09:45.227
<i>I am overcome</i>

1237
01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:50.482
<i>It'd make you laugh to</i>
<i>think someone like me</i>


1238
01:09:50.565 --> 01:09:54.027
<i>Could keep someone like you</i>

1239
01:09:55.737 --> 01:09:58.740
<i>Look what I've become</i>

1240
01:10:01.451 --> 01:10:04.955
<i>You wore your hair down</i>
<i>one time last spring</i>


1241
01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:06.581
<i>In the chapel</i>

1242
01:10:08.041 --> 01:10:10.419
<i>Your lips painted red</i>

1243
01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:13.046
<i>I remember the day</i>

1244
01:10:14.256 --> 01:10:16.049
<i>We hadn't met yet</i>

1245
01:10:16.133 --> 01:10:21.013
<i>How could you possibly</i>
<i>remember that?</i>


1246
01:10:21.096 --> 01:10:23.015
<i>You watched me then</i>

1247
01:10:23.098 --> 01:10:27.978
<i>Why didn't you say</i>
<i>something?</i>


1248
01:10:28.061 --> 01:10:32.232
<i>'Cause every time I see you</i>

1249
01:10:32.316 --> 01:10:37.112
<i>I am overcome</i>

1250
01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:41.199
<i>I try to tell you</i>

1251
01:10:41.283 --> 01:10:45.454
<i>Tell you how much</i>
<i>I need you, too</i>


1252
01:10:47.789 --> 01:10:50.334
<i>But look what I've become</i>

1253
01:10:52.461 --> 01:10:59.217
<i>Nothing feels real anymore</i>
<i>when you're not around me</i>


1254
01:10:59.301 --> 01:11:03.931
<i>Even the sky looks like</i>
<i>it's behind glass</i>


1255
01:11:05.641 --> 01:11:07.392
<i>Hearing your voice now</i>

1256
01:11:07.476 --> 01:11:11.563
<i>I can see everything clearly</i>

1257
01:11:11.647 --> 01:11:17.736
<i>I can see that you really</i>
<i>are my love at last</i>


1258
01:11:17.819 --> 01:11:23.033
<i>But, oh, Roxanne</i>

1259
01:11:24.326 --> 01:11:26.578
<i>I'm right here, love</i>

1260
01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:29.957
<i>Words fail me</i>

1261
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.001
<i>Please come to me</i>

1262
01:11:33.085 --> 01:11:37.130
<i>I try, but I can't</i>

1263
01:11:37.214 --> 01:11:39.258
<i>This is real love</i>

1264
01:11:39.341 --> 01:11:42.678
<i>Dare to believe</i>
<i>you'd have me</i>


1265
01:11:42.761 --> 01:11:46.139
<i>I have no doubt</i>

1266
01:11:46.223 --> 01:11:48.850
<i>I know that</i>
<i>you're the one now</i>


1267
01:11:49.768 --> 01:11:52.479
<i>You don't know anything</i>

1268
01:11:52.562 --> 01:11:55.774
<i>I know that it's you</i>

1269
01:11:55.857 --> 01:11:57.359
<i>Roxanne, if this was true</i>

1270
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.905
<i>Just tell me</i>
<i>what you need now</i>


1271
01:12:01.989 --> 01:12:05.117
<i>Then I'd need for nothing</i>

1272
01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.705
<i>Just tell me what to do</i>

1273
01:12:11.039 --> 01:12:12.040
Give me a kiss.

1274
01:12:12.332 --> 01:12:13.333
No!

1275
01:12:14.876 --> 01:12:18.672
Yes, I asked for a kiss,
but I was too bold!


1276
01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:19.798
You don't insist?

1277
01:12:19.881 --> 01:12:20.966
Yes.

1278
01:12:21.049 --> 01:12:22.384
No.
Be quiet.


1279
01:12:24.428 --> 01:12:25.887
You were speaking of a kiss.

1280
01:12:28.432 --> 01:12:30.517
Yes, what is a kiss?

1281
01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:33.270
Surely, you know.

1282
01:12:33.353 --> 01:12:34.813
I meant metaphorically.

1283
01:12:35.772 --> 01:12:37.482
Is it a vow, a promise...

1284
01:12:37.566 --> 01:12:38.984
a confession...

1285
01:12:39.067 --> 01:12:40.527
a secret...

1286
01:12:40.611 --> 01:12:42.362
a moment of eternity...

1287
01:12:43.405 --> 01:12:45.991
a communion,
a heartbeat?


1288
01:12:46.074 --> 01:12:47.909
No more metaphors.

1289
01:12:47.993 --> 01:12:50.120
Come claim your kiss.

1290
01:12:50.203 --> 01:12:52.164
Literally.

1291
01:13:05.469 --> 01:13:06.470
Go to her.

1292
01:13:12.768 --> 01:13:14.603
It seems wrong now.

1293
01:13:15.479 --> 01:13:16.855
She wants you.

1294
01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:49.781
Which house belongs
to Miss Roxanne?


1295
01:14:49.865 --> 01:14:50.949
Who wants to know?

1296
01:14:51.033 --> 01:14:52.659
I have a letter for her.
From whom?


1297
01:14:52.743 --> 01:14:55.329
It's confidential
and urgent.


1298
01:14:57.372 --> 01:14:59.082
Miss Roxanne...

1299
01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:02.961
the noble Duke de Guiche asked
me in specific, as it is a holy matter...


1300
01:15:03.045 --> 01:15:05.464
to bring that letter
directly to you.


1301
01:15:10.886 --> 01:15:16.475
- <i>My dearest, I have sent a holy man to you</i>
-<i>with a choice.</i>


1302
01:15:16.558 --> 01:15:20.270
<i>You have declared</i>
<i>your love for me...</i>


1303
01:15:20.354 --> 01:15:26.652
<i>and I can no longer wait</i>
<i>to enjoy your treasures.</i>


1304
01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:28.862
<i>I'm on my way to you.</i>

1305
01:15:28.946 --> 01:15:31.865
<i>If you keep the priest there,</i>
<i>I will marry you.</i>


1306
01:15:31.949 --> 01:15:34.826
<i>If you send him away...</i>

1307
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:39.706
<i>we shall consummate our love</i>
<i>without the bonds of vows.</i>


1308
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:41.875
<i>Your choice.</i>

1309
01:15:41.959 --> 01:15:43.543
<i>Either way...</i>

1310
01:15:43.627 --> 01:15:46.964
<i>I will possess you tonight.</i>

1311
01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:06.441
All well?

1312
01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:27.212
Miss Roxanne,
what does it say?


1313
01:16:29.464 --> 01:16:35.554
This letter is delivered into
your hands by a saintly...


1314
01:16:35.637 --> 01:16:38.849
and extremely discreet priest.

1315
01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:41.393
Inform him...

1316
01:16:41.476 --> 01:16:42.561
Roxanne?

1317
01:16:42.644 --> 01:16:46.231
...that it is
the Cardinal's will...


1318
01:16:46.315 --> 01:16:50.068
that he give the blessing
of holy matrimony...


1319
01:16:50.152 --> 01:16:53.572
in secret and without delay
in your home...


1320
01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:55.032
to you...

1321
01:17:06.043 --> 01:17:07.419
and Christian Neuvillette.

1322
01:17:08.503 --> 01:17:09.921
What?

1323
01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:14.259
I told you it was a holy
matter from a worthy lord.


1324
01:17:14.343 --> 01:17:17.763
Is this okay with you, my love?
Nothing could make me happier.


1325
01:17:20.432 --> 01:17:21.516
It says we must hurry.

1326
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.684
Roxanne?

1327
01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:27.356
Yes?

1328
01:17:29.816 --> 01:17:32.277
De Guiche is
on his way here.


1329
01:17:32.361 --> 01:17:34.363
Then you will delay him.

1330
01:17:39.159 --> 01:17:40.452
Thank you.

1331
01:17:40.535 --> 01:17:42.537
Thank you.
I could not be happier.


1332
01:17:48.794 --> 01:17:50.379
You don't know
what you're in for.


1333
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:58.595
<i>I deserve a little kindness</i>

1334
01:17:58.679 --> 01:18:01.640
<i>I deserve my due respect</i>

1335
01:18:01.723 --> 01:18:04.476
<i>I deserve to be beloved</i>

1336
01:18:04.559 --> 01:18:08.981
<i>Just like everybody else</i>

1337
01:18:09.064 --> 01:18:11.775
<i>I deserve my place in heaven</i>

1338
01:18:11.858 --> 01:18:14.945
<i>I deserve an equal share</i>

1339
01:18:15.028 --> 01:18:17.489
<i>I deserve my rightful cut</i>

1340
01:18:17.572 --> 01:18:21.118
<i>Of everything everywhere</i>

1341
01:18:22.577 --> 01:18:24.162
<i>God, Roxanne</i>

1342
01:18:24.246 --> 01:18:27.749
<i>Am I asking for too much?</i>

1343
01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:33.964
<i>Why should I have to beg</i>
<i>for what everybody wants?</i>


1344
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:36.758
<i>Take me right now</i>

1345
01:18:36.842 --> 01:18:39.219
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>if I have your love</i>


1346
01:18:39.303 --> 01:18:41.346
<i>I'll have no fear</i>

1347
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:43.807
<i>Nothing's even</i>
<i>nothing's fair</i>


1348
01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:46.893
<i>Roxanne, I didn't</i>
<i>ask to be here</i>


1349
01:18:46.977 --> 01:18:50.188
<i>I'll pick the lock</i>
<i>I'll draw the knife</i>


1350
01:18:50.272 --> 01:18:53.358
<i>I'll climb the wall</i>
<i>I'll crash the gate</i>


1351
01:18:53.442 --> 01:18:56.528
<i>'Cause I deserve</i>
<i>a happy life</i>


1352
01:18:56.612 --> 01:19:01.408
<i>Whatever I'm not given</i>
<i>I'll take</i>


1353
01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:02.993
"Love is patient.

1354
01:19:03.076 --> 01:19:04.620
<i>God, Roxanne...</i>
"Love is kind.


1355
01:19:04.703 --> 01:19:06.288
<i>...am I asking...</i>
"It does not envy.


1356
01:19:06.371 --> 01:19:08.373
-<i>...for too much?</i> "It
does not boast. -It is not proud."


1357
01:19:08.457 --> 01:19:14.379
<i>Why should I have to beg</i>
<i>for what everybody wants?</i>


1358
01:19:14.463 --> 01:19:17.007
<i>"It keeps no record of wrongs.</i>

1359
01:19:19.343 --> 01:19:23.180
"In sickness and in health,
until death do you part."


1360
01:19:23.263 --> 01:19:24.890
I do.

1361
01:19:24.973 --> 01:19:26.475
"Roxanne...

1362
01:19:26.558 --> 01:19:29.561
"do you take Christian
for your lawful husband...

<i>I deserve a little kindness</i>

1365

1366
01:19:41.365 --> 01:19:44.284
-<i>I deserve to be
beloved</i> ...receive this ring -as a sign of my love...


1367
01:19:44.368 --> 01:19:47.663
<i>Just like everybody else</i>
...and fidelity.


1368
01:19:47.746 --> 01:19:50.582
<i>God gave me</i>

1370
01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:56.755
<i>I deserve to be forgiven</i>

<i>I'll take</i>

1373
01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:16.024
Do you know
what's happened in there?


1374
01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:18.568
The slut.

1375
01:20:25.158 --> 01:20:27.119
She's married a guard.

1376
01:20:32.874 --> 01:20:35.335
She's insane.

1377
01:20:45.262 --> 01:20:47.723
I'm through with love.

1378
01:20:47.806 --> 01:20:50.058
Does one nothing but harm.

1379
01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:58.358
I'm going back in there.

1380
01:21:00.819 --> 01:21:01.820
Attention.

1381
01:21:02.738 --> 01:21:04.364
You, get out of here.

1382
01:21:04.448 --> 01:21:06.533
You, I don't want to
see your face.


1383
01:21:06.617 --> 01:21:08.285
Neuvillette.
Sir.


1384
01:21:08.368 --> 01:21:10.912
Your regiment leaves
for the war tonight.


1385
01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:17.836
You are to depart for the front
at once and deliver these orders immediately.


1386
01:21:17.919 --> 01:21:20.839
You promised the guards
would not be sent to the front.


1387
01:21:20.922 --> 01:21:21.924
Promises?

1388
01:21:23.175 --> 01:21:24.384
Say goodbye
to your husband.


1389
01:21:24.468 --> 01:21:26.303
Do you mean to
make me a widow?


1390
01:21:26.386 --> 01:21:28.305
Only God knows.

1391
01:21:30.307 --> 01:21:31.725
Christian.

1392
01:21:31.808 --> 01:21:32.851
Christian.

1393
01:21:32.935 --> 01:21:34.019
Christian.

1394
01:21:39.775 --> 01:21:42.945
Come, Christian. We must go.

1395
01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:46.698
Roxanne, I love you,
and I will return to you.


1396
01:21:53.664 --> 01:21:54.665
Enough.

1397
01:22:04.716 --> 01:22:05.717
Cyrano.

1398
01:22:07.427 --> 01:22:10.514
Promise me
he will not be cold or hungry.


1399
01:22:10.597 --> 01:22:12.599
I can't promise that.

1400
01:22:12.683 --> 01:22:14.893
Promise me
he will be faithful.


1401
01:22:14.977 --> 01:22:17.354
Of course he will,
but I cannot promise you.


1402
01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:22.276
Promise me...

1403
01:22:22.359 --> 01:22:23.610
he will write.

1404
01:22:28.532 --> 01:22:30.284
That I can promise you.

1405
01:22:58.937 --> 01:23:03.942
- <i>How is it I feel</i>
-<i>you closer to me</i>


1406
01:23:04.026 --> 01:23:08.405
<i>Now that the world's</i>
<i>between us?</i>


1407
01:23:08.488 --> 01:23:13.994
<i>What I wouldn't do just to</i>
<i>get some sleep</i>


1408
01:23:14.077 --> 01:23:18.415
<i>But we're taking fire</i>
<i>But we're taking fire</i>


1409
01:23:18.498 --> 01:23:24.129
<i>There are some things that</i>
<i>my mind can't do</i>


1410
01:23:24.212 --> 01:23:28.300
<i>The machine takes over</i>
<i>The machine takes over</i>


1411
01:23:28.383 --> 01:23:33.847
<i>I'd kill the world to get</i>
<i>back home to you</i>


1412
01:23:33.931 --> 01:23:38.685
<i>But I'm getting tired</i>
<i>But I'm getting tired</i>


1413
01:23:38.769 --> 01:23:41.939
<i>If I close my eyes maybe</i>
<i>I'll see you there</i>


1414
01:23:43.899 --> 01:23:46.944
<i>One more time</i>

1415
01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:51.156
<i>And I will</i>
<i>give you my word</i>


1416
01:23:51.239 --> 01:23:56.787
<i>I'm so afraid you won't</i>
<i>believe it</i>


1417
01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.708
<i>And if I told you</i>
<i>all I've done</i>


1418
01:24:01.792 --> 01:24:06.338
<i>I know it'd make you cry</i>

1419
01:24:07.923 --> 01:24:12.803
<i>So I will close my eyes</i>
<i>And let the falling skies</i>


1420
01:24:12.886 --> 01:24:16.556
<i>Lay down between us</i>
<i>Lay down between us</i>


1421
01:24:17.975 --> 01:24:22.562
<i>I will close my eyes</i>
<i>And let the falling skies</i>


1422
01:24:22.646 --> 01:24:26.358
<i>Lay down between us</i>
<i>Lay down between us</i>


1423
01:25:14.698 --> 01:25:17.618
Friendly!
Friendly coming through.


1424
01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.873
Cyrano.

1425
01:25:38.055 --> 01:25:40.349
Every morning,
they shoot.


1426
01:25:40.432 --> 01:25:43.435
And every morning,
they miss.


1427
01:25:43.518 --> 01:25:45.437
And one morning,
they'll get lucky.


1428
01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.814
You're risking your life
to send a letter.


1429
01:25:49.232 --> 01:25:51.652
I promised her
he would write.


1430
01:25:57.908 --> 01:25:59.826
<i>It's a suicide mission.</i>

1431
01:26:01.286 --> 01:26:05.374
Those orders from the King
command me to decide...


1432
01:26:05.457 --> 01:26:08.293
which of my units
must perish.


1433
01:26:09.461 --> 01:26:11.755
<i>Do I send</i>
<i>the most expendable?</i>


1434
01:26:11.838 --> 01:26:13.382
Where are you going?

1435
01:26:13.465 --> 01:26:15.008
To write a letter.

1436
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:17.552
Or the bravest?

1437
01:26:29.648 --> 01:26:30.691
The guards.

1438
01:26:32.567 --> 01:26:33.819
Make out the orders...

1439
01:26:34.945 --> 01:26:38.615
to Captain Le Bret
immediately.


1440
01:26:38.699 --> 01:26:40.909
<i>We'll let God</i>
<i>decide the rest.</i>


1441
01:26:51.586 --> 01:26:54.464
I take no pleasure
in this.


1442
01:26:56.967 --> 01:26:58.885
I serve my King.

1443
01:27:00.053 --> 01:27:01.722
Not my spite.

1444
01:27:03.307 --> 01:27:04.600
Form break.

1445
01:27:04.683 --> 01:27:06.393
Present arms.
Platoons! Get ready.


1446
01:27:06.476 --> 01:27:09.771
Platoon commanders,
steady your men!


1447
01:27:12.524 --> 01:27:14.276
<i>Form line!</i>

1448
01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:19.364
This child has delivered our
orders from the King.


1449
01:27:23.702 --> 01:27:24.828
These are from de Guiche.

1450
01:27:24.911 --> 01:27:26.872
Correct.
In service of the King.


1451
01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:30.250
We've been holding this
godforsaken rock for months.


1452
01:27:30.334 --> 01:27:32.044
On the King's orders.

1453
01:27:32.127 --> 01:27:35.005
And now we have the noble
distinction of being chosen to mount an attack.


1454
01:27:36.632 --> 01:27:37.925
De Guiche wants me dead.

1455
01:27:38.008 --> 01:27:39.718
The odds are against us.

1456
01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:45.390
I'd rather die down there
fighting...


1457
01:27:45.474 --> 01:27:47.017
than starve up here waiting.

1458
01:27:48.936 --> 01:27:50.270
Then ready yourself.

1459
01:27:55.108 --> 01:27:56.526
Form line!

1460
01:27:59.112 --> 01:28:00.989
Captain, steady your men!

1461
01:28:01.907 --> 01:28:03.992
Collect the letters.

1462
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:16.046
<i>I have a wife</i>

1463
01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:18.674
<i>I haven't seen</i>

1464
01:28:18.757 --> 01:28:21.969
<i>Since lilacs bloomed</i>
<i>in Saint-Hippolyte</i>


1465
01:28:23.553 --> 01:28:25.389
<i>She always wears them</i>

1466
01:28:26.306 --> 01:28:28.517
<i>In her hair</i>

1467
01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.604
<i>And she lets them fall down</i>
<i>everywhere</i>


1468
01:28:32.688 --> 01:28:38.068
<i>I can see her</i>
<i>in the glowing light</i>


1469
01:28:38.151 --> 01:28:41.488
<i>Dressing without a sound</i>

1470
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:47.244
<i>I promised</i>
<i>I'd be home all right</i>


1471
01:28:47.327 --> 01:28:51.873
<i>But I gotta</i>
<i>lay this body down</i>


1472
01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:56.253
<i>So take this letter</i>

1473
01:28:56.336 --> 01:28:58.630
<i>To my wife</i>

1474
01:28:58.714 --> 01:29:01.800
<i>And tell her that</i>
<i>I loved my life</i>


1475
01:29:03.802 --> 01:29:05.929
<i>And tell my boys</i>

1476
01:29:06.013 --> 01:29:08.640
<i>The Lord, he found me</i>

1477
01:29:08.724 --> 01:29:10.892
<i>When I say</i>
<i>their names out loud</i>


1478
01:29:10.976 --> 01:29:12.894
<i>They're all around me</i>

1479
01:29:12.978 --> 01:29:14.187
<i>And tell 'em</i>

1480
01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:20.277
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1481
01:29:23.363 --> 01:29:26.283
<i>Heaven</i>

1482
01:29:26.366 --> 01:29:30.621
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1483
01:29:33.624 --> 01:29:36.126
<i>I have a girl</i>

1484
01:29:36.209 --> 01:29:37.794
<i>I think I love her</i>

1485
01:29:38.837 --> 01:29:40.589
<i>I should have told her</i>

1486
01:29:40.672 --> 01:29:42.591
<i>Instead I told her mother</i>

1487
01:29:43.759 --> 01:29:46.303
<i>I gave her chocolates</i>

1488
01:29:46.386 --> 01:29:47.554
<i>I bought a ring</i>

1489
01:29:48.764 --> 01:29:52.684
<i>But I never told her</i>
<i>anything</i>


1490
01:29:52.768 --> 01:29:58.315
<i>But I can see her</i>
<i>in every detail now</i>


1491
01:29:58.398 --> 01:30:01.818
<i>Turning in my mind</i>

1492
01:30:03.236 --> 01:30:07.407
<i>I barely knew</i>
<i>that girl at all</i>


1493
01:30:07.491 --> 01:30:10.327
<i>But I will love her till</i>
<i>the end of time</i>


1494
01:30:13.789 --> 01:30:16.333
<i>So take this letter</i>

1495
01:30:16.416 --> 01:30:18.794
<i>To my girl</i>

1496
01:30:18.877 --> 01:30:23.507
<i>Tell her that I saw</i>
<i>the whole world</i>


1497
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:28.178
<i>Say that right before I fell</i>

1498
01:30:28.262 --> 01:30:30.514
<i>I said her name out loud</i>

1499
01:30:31.682 --> 01:30:33.225
<i>Isabelle</i>

1500
01:30:33.308 --> 01:30:35.352
<i>And tell her</i>

1501
01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.982
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1502
01:30:43.527 --> 01:30:46.530
<i>Heaven</i>

1503
01:30:46.613 --> 01:30:50.284
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1504
01:30:53.829 --> 01:30:55.455
<i>I have a father</i>

1505
01:30:56.373 --> 01:30:57.541
<i>He isn't well</i>

1506
01:30:59.001 --> 01:31:02.462
<i>He thinks he might be</i>
<i>going to hell</i>


1507
01:31:03.922 --> 01:31:05.424
<i>He was a sinner</i>

1508
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.718
<i>He liked to fight</i>

1509
01:31:09.094 --> 01:31:12.848
<i>So I don't know</i>
<i>he might be right</i>


1510
01:31:12.931 --> 01:31:18.228
<i>I can see him</i>
<i>every Sunday morning</i>


1511
01:31:18.312 --> 01:31:21.857
<i>Diving into the fray</i>

1512
01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:28.030
<i>He wasn't</i>
<i>one of God's best men</i>


1513
01:31:28.113 --> 01:31:32.200
<i>But I loved him anyway</i>

1514
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:35.329
<i>So take this letter</i>

1515
01:31:36.663 --> 01:31:39.124
<i>To him, please</i>

1516
01:31:39.207 --> 01:31:42.669
<i>And tell him I can't wait</i>
<i>to see him</i>


1517
01:31:43.962 --> 01:31:45.339
<i>I went in first</i>

1518
01:31:46.465 --> 01:31:48.967
<i>I rang the bell</i>

1519
01:31:49.051 --> 01:31:52.763
<i>I called his name out loud</i>
<i>and I gave 'em hell</i>


1520
01:31:52.846 --> 01:31:54.514
<i>So tell him</i>

1521
01:31:56.683 --> 01:32:00.354
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1522
01:32:03.607 --> 01:32:06.610
<i>Heaven</i>

1523
01:32:06.693 --> 01:32:10.155
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1524
01:32:13.408 --> 01:32:14.409
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1525
01:32:16.536 --> 01:32:20.791
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1526
01:32:23.502 --> 01:32:26.463
<i>Heaven</i>

1527
01:32:26.546 --> 01:32:30.425
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1528
01:32:33.262 --> 01:32:34.346
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1529
01:32:34.429 --> 01:32:35.555
Roxanne.

1530
01:32:36.556 --> 01:32:39.351
<i>Not to cry at all</i>
I know.


1531
01:32:39.434 --> 01:32:41.436
I wish I could
write her one last letter.


1532
01:32:43.355 --> 01:32:45.649
You have.
<i>Heaven</i>


1533
01:32:45.732 --> 01:32:46.817
Let me see.

1534
01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:48.485
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1535
01:32:48.568 --> 01:32:50.195
No need.

1536
01:32:50.279 --> 01:32:51.822
Of course
there's a need.


1537
01:33:08.755 --> 01:33:10.215
What's this?

1538
01:33:10.299 --> 01:33:11.550
What?

1539
01:33:11.633 --> 01:33:13.302
This.

1540
01:33:13.385 --> 01:33:14.511
It's a tear stain.

1541
01:33:14.595 --> 01:33:16.221
Is it? That's odd.

1542
01:33:19.308 --> 01:33:23.103
We poets sometimes are so moved
by our own creations that we...


1543
01:33:23.186 --> 01:33:24.229
It's poetic empathy.

1544
01:33:25.606 --> 01:33:27.399
You cried
writing this letter?


1545
01:33:30.027 --> 01:33:33.030
Yes. I cannot
bear not to see her again.


1546
01:33:35.574 --> 01:33:37.159
We will never
see her again.


1547
01:33:37.242 --> 01:33:41.246
You, her beloved husband, might
die and never see her again.


1548
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:42.623
That is the tear stain.

1549
01:33:44.791 --> 01:33:46.084
You're in love
with her.


1550
01:33:46.168 --> 01:33:47.169
What?

1551
01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:50.505
You've gone mad.
You're starving.


1552
01:33:50.589 --> 01:33:52.132
Deny it then.

1553
01:33:53.508 --> 01:33:54.676
Do you love her?

1554
01:33:59.139 --> 01:34:00.515
It's too simple.

1555
01:34:03.894 --> 01:34:05.145
I knew it.

1556
01:34:06.521 --> 01:34:08.523
But I didn't...

1557
01:34:08.607 --> 01:34:10.609
I didn't dare
let myself believe it.


1558
01:34:11.652 --> 01:34:12.819
I feel sick.

1559
01:34:12.903 --> 01:34:14.738
You've always loved her.
I will deny it.


1560
01:34:14.821 --> 01:34:16.448
You can't deny it.
You can't even hide it.


1561
01:34:16.531 --> 01:34:18.158
Christian, listen to me.

1562
01:34:18.241 --> 01:34:20.160
If I should die and you should
live, and she mentions the letters...


1563
01:34:20.243 --> 01:34:21.912
do not be surprised...
At what?


1564
01:34:21.995 --> 01:34:23.747
If she mentions
their volume.


1565
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:25.749
You've written to her
more often than you know.


1566
01:34:25.832 --> 01:34:27.834
How often?
Often enough.


1567
01:34:27.918 --> 01:34:29.544
Twice a week?
More.


1568
01:34:29.628 --> 01:34:31.296
Three times a week?
More than that.


1569
01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:33.131
Four? Five?
More.


1570
01:34:33.215 --> 01:34:34.675
Every day?
Yes, every day.


1571
01:35:03.578 --> 01:35:05.372
She doesn't love me.

1572
01:35:05.455 --> 01:35:07.791
Of course she does.

1573
01:35:07.874 --> 01:35:10.794
In her most recent letter,
she said she loves me...


1574
01:35:10.877 --> 01:35:12.212
because of my soul.

1575
01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:14.631
What could be
more loving?


1576
01:35:14.715 --> 01:35:16.258
You are my soul!

1577
01:35:21.972 --> 01:35:23.348
We have to
tell her the truth...


1578
01:35:24.516 --> 01:35:26.685
and you must
confess your love.


1579
01:35:26.768 --> 01:35:28.979
The world will never
accept a midget...


1580
01:35:29.062 --> 01:35:30.981
and a tall
beautiful woman.


1581
01:35:31.064 --> 01:35:33.525
Never mind the world.
What about Roxanne?


1582
01:35:34.985 --> 01:35:37.696
She's got a huge heart.

1583
01:35:37.779 --> 01:35:41.700
In the same letter, she
reassured me that she'd still love me...


1584
01:35:41.783 --> 01:35:44.995
even if I return
from this hell a broken man...


1585
01:35:45.078 --> 01:35:47.205
disfigured and
body destroyed.


1586
01:35:47.289 --> 01:35:48.540
She said that?

1587
01:36:05.515 --> 01:36:06.558
Don't believe her.

1588
01:36:06.642 --> 01:36:07.893
Don't doubt her.

1589
01:36:09.353 --> 01:36:11.563
Take your positions!

1590
01:36:14.191 --> 01:36:15.400
We have betrayed her.

1591
01:36:15.484 --> 01:36:17.194
We can never tell her.
It'll break her heart.


1592
01:36:17.277 --> 01:36:18.570
We have to tell her.

1593
01:36:18.654 --> 01:36:20.405
It's our moral...

1594
01:36:20.489 --> 01:36:21.657
Our moral...

1595
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:24.576
Obligation.

1596
01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:25.744
See you on the other side!

1597
01:36:25.827 --> 01:36:27.746
We must let her
decide our fate.


1598
01:36:27.829 --> 01:36:30.666
One of us,
none of us...


1599
01:36:30.749 --> 01:36:32.584
She must have
the choice.


1600
01:36:32.668 --> 01:36:34.294
Form the line!

1601
01:36:36.505 --> 01:36:39.216
And I'm certain
she'll choose you.


1602
01:36:39.299 --> 01:36:40.676
She's already
chosen you.


1603
01:36:40.759 --> 01:36:42.511
Love at first sight.
She married you.


1604
01:36:42.594 --> 01:36:44.221
She doesn't love me.
She doesn't even know me.


1605
01:36:44.304 --> 01:36:45.681
She doesn't
love me either.


1606
01:36:45.764 --> 01:36:47.683
I think she does.

1607
01:36:47.766 --> 01:36:50.686
And I would prefer to be loved
for my true self or not at all.


1608
01:36:52.688 --> 01:36:54.147
Get ready!

1609
01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.066
Christian.

1610
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:57.859
Attention!

1611
01:36:57.943 --> 01:36:59.236
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1612
01:36:59.319 --> 01:37:01.071
See you on the other side!

1613
01:37:01.154 --> 01:37:05.033
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1614
01:37:08.245 --> 01:37:10.330
<i>Heaven</i>

1615
01:37:11.164 --> 01:37:15.502
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1616
01:37:15.585 --> 01:37:18.046
Soldier, back in line!

1617
01:37:18.130 --> 01:37:19.631
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1618
01:37:19.715 --> 01:37:21.091
Soldier!

1619
01:37:21.174 --> 01:37:25.596
<i>Not to cry at all</i>
Christian! No!


1620
01:37:28.181 --> 01:37:30.809
<i>Heaven</i>

1621
01:37:30.892 --> 01:37:35.814
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1622
01:38:08.555 --> 01:38:10.015
You will live.

1623
01:38:12.017 --> 01:38:16.647
You will live for Roxanne
who loves you.


1624
01:38:21.026 --> 01:38:23.570
Tell her everything.

1625
01:38:23.654 --> 01:38:24.655
Please.

1626
01:38:26.657 --> 01:38:27.866
Everything.

1627
01:38:32.788 --> 01:38:34.289
Roxanne.

1628
01:38:39.503 --> 01:38:40.879
Forward!

1629
01:38:40.963 --> 01:38:44.508
Forward! Forward! Forward!

1630
01:38:51.056 --> 01:38:52.266
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1631
01:38:54.142 --> 01:38:58.355
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1632
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:04.278
<i>Heaven</i>

1633
01:39:04.361 --> 01:39:08.615
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1634
01:39:10.701 --> 01:39:12.077
<i>Tell 'em</i>

1635
01:39:13.912 --> 01:39:18.166
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1636
01:39:19.334 --> 01:39:23.797
Make ready! And fire!
<i>Heaven</i>


1637
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:27.926
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1638
01:39:30.095 --> 01:39:31.430
Fire!
<i>Tell 'em</i>


1639
01:39:33.557 --> 01:39:37.769
<i>Not to cry at all</i>

1640
01:39:37.853 --> 01:39:39.104
Fire!

1641
01:39:40.355 --> 01:39:43.483
<i>Heaven</i>

1642
01:39:43.567 --> 01:39:48.488
<i>Is wherever I fall</i>

1643
01:39:56.121 --> 01:40:00.959
Sister Claire, must I remind
you, you have accepted a life without mirrors?


1644
01:40:01.043 --> 01:40:02.628
Stop admiring yourself...

1645
01:40:02.711 --> 01:40:04.463
or I will be forced
to tell Cyrano.


1646
01:40:04.546 --> 01:40:06.757
Oh, no.
He'll make such fun of me.


1647
01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:10.469
And promise me you will stop
trying to convert him.


1648
01:40:10.552 --> 01:40:13.764
He's been coming here every
Saturday for as long as I can remember.


1649
01:40:14.598 --> 01:40:16.516
Why does he
not believe?


1650
01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:18.477
Miss Roxanne
is his faith.


1651
01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:21.063
His weekly visits
are his service.


1652
01:40:21.146 --> 01:40:23.482
It saddens me
he won't see heaven.


1653
01:40:23.565 --> 01:40:26.151
I'm sure the Lord
has a plan for him.


1654
01:40:26.234 --> 01:40:28.862
You should worry about
his remaining time on Earth.


1655
01:40:28.946 --> 01:40:30.656
Get him to eat.

1656
01:40:30.739 --> 01:40:32.991
He always says
he's not hungry.


1657
01:40:33.075 --> 01:40:35.243
He says,
"I ate good meat yesterday."


1658
01:40:35.327 --> 01:40:37.079
It's not true.

1659
01:40:37.162 --> 01:40:39.706
He's too proud
to admit he can't afford it.


1660
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:41.333
He's starving.

1661
01:40:41.416 --> 01:40:43.335
Insist he eats with us
this evening.


1662
01:40:43.418 --> 01:40:44.836
Yes, Mother.

1663
01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.964
He'll be here at six o'clock to
bring her the news.


1664
01:40:50.801 --> 01:40:51.843
<i>Dear Roxanne...</i>

1665
01:40:51.927 --> 01:40:53.720
<i>Dear Roxanne.</i>

1666
01:40:53.804 --> 01:40:56.181
<i>...how many times have I</i>
<i>sat by your side and wanted to tell you?</i>


1667
01:40:56.265 --> 01:40:57.307
<i>Dear Roxanne.</i>

1668
01:40:57.391 --> 01:40:58.392
<i>Almost told you?</i>

1669
01:40:58.475 --> 01:40:59.643
<i>Dear Roxanne.</i>

1670
01:40:59.726 --> 01:41:01.353
<i>There is nothing</i>
<i>so dangerous and sweet...</i>


1671
01:41:01.436 --> 01:41:03.105
<i>to keep as</i>
<i>a secret like this.</i>


1672
01:41:03.188 --> 01:41:05.274
<i>I have sublimated.</i>

1673
01:41:05.357 --> 01:41:06.900
<i>Tell her. Tell her.</i>

1674
01:41:06.984 --> 01:41:08.527
<i>How many letters</i>
<i>have I written...</i>


1675
01:41:08.610 --> 01:41:09.653
<i>Tell her.</i>

1676
01:41:09.736 --> 01:41:10.737
<i>Trying to spell it out plainly.</i>

1677
01:41:10.821 --> 01:41:11.905
Plainly.

1678
01:41:11.989 --> 01:41:13.198
<i>Simply.</i>

1679
01:41:14.116 --> 01:41:15.158
Simply.

1680
01:41:17.744 --> 01:41:19.204
Without art.

1681
01:41:22.124 --> 01:41:23.125
Ob...

1682
01:41:42.477 --> 01:41:44.146
<i>Tell her the truth.</i>

1683
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:46.398
<i>You. Always you.</i>

1684
01:41:46.481 --> 01:41:47.733
<i>You. You.</i>

1685
01:41:47.816 --> 01:41:49.735
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>I've always loved you.</i>


1686
01:41:49.818 --> 01:41:51.695
<i>Tell her. Tell her.</i>

1687
01:41:51.778 --> 01:41:54.489
<i>I will die loving you,</i>
<i>and you will never know.</i>


1688
01:41:54.573 --> 01:41:55.991
<i>Tell her.</i>

1689
01:42:41.912 --> 01:42:43.538
He'll be here.

1690
01:42:43.622 --> 01:42:45.624
He's always on time.

1691
01:42:48.710 --> 01:42:50.420
Going somewhere?

1692
01:42:53.048 --> 01:42:54.132
You're late.

1693
01:42:54.216 --> 01:42:55.717
I was delayed.

1694
01:42:56.718 --> 01:42:57.803
By what?

1695
01:42:57.886 --> 01:42:59.429
An untimely visitor.

1696
01:43:03.642 --> 01:43:05.102
You sent him away?

1697
01:43:07.396 --> 01:43:12.025
I fear I only
put him off for a short while.


1698
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:14.152
Well, he will
have to wait...


1699
01:43:14.236 --> 01:43:17.781
because I will not
let you leave before nightfall.


1700
01:43:17.864 --> 01:43:19.116
You've cut yourself.

1701
01:43:20.575 --> 01:43:22.911
A scratch, really.

1702
01:43:25.831 --> 01:43:28.000
Aren't you going to
tease Sister Claire?


1703
01:43:28.083 --> 01:43:30.210
She waits for it
all week, you know.


1704
01:43:32.129 --> 01:43:34.214
Sister Claire,
you have such lovely eyes.


1705
01:43:34.298 --> 01:43:36.049
Why do you keep them
cast down?


1706
01:43:37.217 --> 01:43:39.303
I ate good meat
yesterday.


1707
01:43:40.679 --> 01:43:42.764
When you're ready,
come to the dining hall.


1708
01:43:42.848 --> 01:43:44.433
Then I'll give you
a big bowl of soup.


1709
01:43:44.516 --> 01:43:46.059
Yes.
Good.


1710
01:43:46.143 --> 01:43:48.770
I think Sister Claire
is trying to convert you.


1711
01:43:48.854 --> 01:43:49.855
I am not.

1712
01:43:50.522 --> 01:43:51.857
Mother warned me off.

1713
01:43:55.110 --> 01:43:56.111
Sister Claire.

1714
01:43:57.696 --> 01:44:00.449
Tonight, I will let you
pray for me.


1715
01:44:02.618 --> 01:44:04.911
I have not waited
for your permission.


1716
01:44:16.798 --> 01:44:18.967
Do you remember
the day we first met?


1717
01:44:22.471 --> 01:44:23.555
Yes.

1718
01:44:25.641 --> 01:44:27.935
It was early morning
in early June.


1719
01:44:29.353 --> 01:44:32.064
I'd come to borrow a book
from your father.


1720
01:44:32.147 --> 01:44:37.569
We found you curled up on the
floor in the library in the dawn light...


1721
01:44:37.653 --> 01:44:40.739
a tome for a pillow.

1722
01:44:40.822 --> 01:44:43.742
You were reading
the very book that I'd come for.


1723
01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.453
I refused to give it up.

1724
01:44:48.330 --> 01:44:50.457
Your youth
made it forgivable.


1725
01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:52.209
I hadn't finished
reading it.


1726
01:44:52.292 --> 01:44:53.919
I didn't mind.

1727
01:44:54.002 --> 01:44:55.837
You said you'd give it to me
when you had.


1728
01:44:55.921 --> 01:44:57.172
And I did.

1729
01:44:59.841 --> 01:45:02.386
It was as if
we'd always known each other.


1730
01:45:04.179 --> 01:45:05.847
And now we have.

1731
01:45:09.476 --> 01:45:13.438
They say light
is the soul of a holy space.


1732
01:45:13.522 --> 01:45:15.399
It's designed
to be enough.


1733
01:45:17.693 --> 01:45:19.194
Enough beauty...

1734
01:45:22.864 --> 01:45:24.574
to just let go.

1735
01:45:30.038 --> 01:45:31.498
Are you melancholy?

1736
01:45:33.125 --> 01:45:34.167
No.

1737
01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:35.419
No.

1738
01:45:43.051 --> 01:45:44.803
Do you have
my daily paper?


1739
01:45:44.886 --> 01:45:46.179
Yes, I do.

1740
01:45:46.263 --> 01:45:47.389
Good.

1741
01:45:50.434 --> 01:45:53.478
Last Saturday, the 19th,
I saw you.


1742
01:45:53.562 --> 01:45:55.897
And then a week passed in which
nothing important happened...


1743
01:45:55.981 --> 01:45:57.065
and now here
I am again.


1744
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:58.900
Cyrano.
All right.


1745
01:45:59.818 --> 01:46:01.403
The news.

1746
01:46:11.663 --> 01:46:15.375
On Saturday, the head of state
ate too many prunes...


1747
01:46:15.459 --> 01:46:17.669
and he took to his bed
with a fever.


1748
01:46:17.753 --> 01:46:20.172
He was executed by his
physician...


1749
01:46:20.255 --> 01:46:22.174
and now he is feeling
much better.


1750
01:46:25.093 --> 01:46:27.471
There was a ball
on Sunday...


1751
01:46:27.554 --> 01:46:32.476
and 762 wax candles
were burned...


1752
01:46:34.811 --> 01:46:35.812
out.

1753
01:46:38.857 --> 01:46:43.570
On Monday, our troops were
reported to have beaten everyone...


1754
01:46:43.654 --> 01:46:44.947
everywhere.

1755
01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:52.788
On Tuesday, a tiny little dog
had to be given a very large enema.


1756
01:47:00.671 --> 01:47:02.297
On Wednesday, nothing.

1757
01:47:04.299 --> 01:47:07.052
On Thursday...

1758
01:47:07.135 --> 01:47:11.223
someone somewhere,
who isn't us, took a new lover.


1759
01:47:15.769 --> 01:47:17.145
On Friday...

1760
01:47:18.981 --> 01:47:20.649
I was the queen...

1761
01:47:25.237 --> 01:47:26.488
of almost.

1762
01:47:31.076 --> 01:47:32.244
Today...

1763
01:47:37.332 --> 01:47:39.418
Today, I...

1764
01:47:39.501 --> 01:47:40.669
I...

1765
01:47:41.878 --> 01:47:43.255
I...

1766
01:47:51.722 --> 01:47:53.724
Shall we get you
that soup?


1767
01:47:57.853 --> 01:47:59.438
Not yet.

1768
01:47:59.521 --> 01:48:00.731
Not yet.

1769
01:48:01.565 --> 01:48:02.816
Oh, my dear.

1770
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:05.569
What is to be done?

1771
01:48:07.112 --> 01:48:09.364
Just my old wound
from the war.


1772
01:48:10.949 --> 01:48:12.492
Damn that war.

1773
01:48:23.879 --> 01:48:27.382
You told me one day you would
let me read Christian's last letter.


1774
01:48:31.219 --> 01:48:32.304
Now?

1775
01:48:35.307 --> 01:48:36.308
Please.

1776
01:49:04.252 --> 01:49:05.504
Thank you.

1777
01:49:16.974 --> 01:49:19.351
"Farewell, Roxanne...

1778
01:49:19.434 --> 01:49:22.437
"I believe this will be
my last day, my beloved.


1779
01:49:23.772 --> 01:49:27.025
"My soul is heavy
with unexpressed love.


1780
01:49:28.610 --> 01:49:31.863
"Fullness of heart
cannot be recorded.


1781
01:49:31.947 --> 01:49:34.992
"It will not live on
in my bones when I am gone.


1782
01:49:37.369 --> 01:49:39.538
"It will not be buried
in my grave.


1783
01:49:40.998 --> 01:49:43.458
"The exact measure of my love
cannot be given to you...


1784
01:49:43.542 --> 01:49:45.585
"in words to outlast
my last breath.


1785
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:47.879
"No matter how I wish it,
for I am dust.


1786
01:49:47.963 --> 01:49:49.631
"And dust to dust...

1787
01:49:50.799 --> 01:49:53.010
"I'm going to die today,
my love."


1788
01:49:53.093 --> 01:49:54.469
You are not reading.

1789
01:49:56.221 --> 01:49:57.848
You are remembering.

1790
01:50:05.856 --> 01:50:07.399
It was you.

1791
01:50:07.482 --> 01:50:08.567
No, Roxanne.

1792
01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:10.902
Make your confession.
No, Roxanne.


1793
01:50:10.986 --> 01:50:12.154
The letters.
No.


1794
01:50:12.237 --> 01:50:13.322
The words.
No.


1795
01:50:13.405 --> 01:50:15.407
The voice in the night
below my balcony.


1796
01:50:15.490 --> 01:50:17.034
All of it. You.

1797
01:50:17.117 --> 01:50:19.036
I married him that night
because of your words.


1798
01:50:19.119 --> 01:50:20.245
You married him,
not my words.


1799
01:50:20.329 --> 01:50:21.496
Why are you denying it?

1800
01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:23.582
Because I do not love you,
my love.


1801
01:50:24.708 --> 01:50:26.668
Yes, you do.
Christian loved you.


1802
01:50:26.752 --> 01:50:28.420
You wrote that letter.
No.


1803
01:50:28.503 --> 01:50:30.172
That tear is yours.
The blood is his!


1804
01:50:30.255 --> 01:50:32.799
Why tell me now? Why?

1805
01:50:32.883 --> 01:50:35.093
I believe this will be
my last day.


1806
01:50:35.177 --> 01:50:36.178
No.

1807
01:50:39.681 --> 01:50:40.766
No.

1808
01:50:42.017 --> 01:50:43.060
No.

1809
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:47.773
<i>No, Cyrano</i>

1810
01:50:47.856 --> 01:50:50.984

1811
01:50:51.068 --> 01:50:55.238

1812
01:50:56.531 --> 01:50:59.451
<i>I'm alone, Cyrano</i>

1813
01:50:59.534 --> 01:51:02.955
<i>I've nowhere to go</i>

1814
01:51:03.038 --> 01:51:07.459
<i>You have to stay with me</i>

1815
01:51:09.419 --> 01:51:11.463
<i>Oh, Roxanne</i>

1816
01:51:11.546 --> 01:51:14.841
<i>I don't understand</i>

1817
01:51:14.925 --> 01:51:19.304
<i>The one you love's not here</i>

1818
01:51:20.847 --> 01:51:23.308
<i>I buried that man</i>

1819

01:51:56.925 --> 01:51:59.595
<i>It's okay, Roxanne</i>

1826
01:51:59.678 --> 01:52:02.347
<i>I've known what I am</i>

1827
01:52:02.431 --> 01:52:06.935
<i>From the second</i>

<i>Ever since then</i>

1829
01:52:11.356 --> 01:52:14.526
<i>I've been a patient man</i>

1830
01:52:15.319 --> 01:52:19.448
<i>Patient with desire</i>

1831
01:52:21.074 --> 01:52:23.869
<i>I know, Cyrano</i>

1832
01:52:23.952 --> 01:52:27.164
<i>I know who you are</i>

1833
01:52:27.247 --> 01:52:31.335
<i>Love, I feel the same</i>

1834
01:52:33.086 --> 01:52:35.839
<i>So, no, Cyrano</i>

1835
01:52:35.922 --> 01:52:38.884

01:52:45.807 --> 01:52:47.267
You love me.

01:52:48.352 --> 01:52:49.353
Yes.

1839
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:52.564
And I will not
lose you twice.


1840

-<i>Have you ever wanted</i>

It's you I love.

1845
01:53:39.945 --> 01:53:42.030
You loved the words.

1846
01:53:42.531 --> 01:53:44.032
No.

1847
01:53:44.116 --> 01:53:45.325
You.

1848
01:53:48.328 --> 01:53:50.497
I love Cyrano.

1849
01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:52.499
Cyrano is my love.

I have always
loved Cyrano.

No.

No.
