00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:16.893
from the short story by
ROALD DAHL


2
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.351
Ernie had been given a rifle
for his birthday.


3
00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:36.018
He took the gun and a box of bullets
and went to see what he could kill.


4
00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:37.310
Outside Raymond's house,

5
00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:40.143
he stuck two fingers in his mouth
and gave a long shrill whistle.


6
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.435
Raymond was Ernie's best friend.
He lived four doors away.


7
00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:46.518
He held up the rifle over his head.

8
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:49.851
"Gripes!" said Raymond.
"We can have some fun with that!"


9
00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:53.768
The two boys set off.
This was a Saturday morning in May.


10
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:55.810
The chestnut trees were in full flower,

11
00:00:55.893 --> 00:00:58.226
and the hawthorn was white
along the hedgerows.


12
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.143
As Ernie and Raymond
progressed up the narrow hedgy lane,


13
00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.226
they shot every little bird they saw.

14
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.143
Bullfinches, hedge sparrows,
whitethroats, yellowhammers.


15
00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:09.268
When they reached the railway line,
there were 14 small birds


16
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:10.851
dangling on a line of string.

17
00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:14.851
"Look!" whispered Ernie,
pointing with a long arm. "Over there!"


18
00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:16.768
There was a small boy looking up

19
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:19.476
into the branches of an old tree
through binoculars.


20
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.101
"Watson! That little twerp."

21
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:24.476
Peter Watson had a small, frail body.

22
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.518
Face freckled
and he wore spectacles with thick lenses.


23
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:28.851
He was a brilliant pupil,

24
00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:31.726
already in senior class at school
though he was only 13.


25
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.560
He loved music and played the piano well.

26
00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:37.143
He was no good at games.
He was quiet and polite.


27
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.310
The two bigger boys
crept up slowly on the small boy.


28
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.851
He did not see them
because he had the binoculars to his eyes


29
00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:49.518
and was deeply captivated
by what he was looking at.


30
00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:52.851
"Stick 'em up!"
Ernie shouted, pointing the gun.


31
00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:54.560
Peter Watson jumped.

32
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.226
He stared through his spectacles
at the two intruders.


33
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.518
"Go on!" Ernie shouted. "Stick 'em up!"

34
00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:02.935
Peter Watson stood still,

35
00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:05.726
holding the binoculars
in front of him with both hands.


36
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.560
He looked at Raymond and Ernie.

37
00:02:07.643 --> 00:02:11.143
He wasn't afraid, but knew better
than to play the fool with these two.


38
00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:13.768
He'd suffered
from their attentions over the years.


39
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:14.893
Hands up.

40
00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:16.851
It was the only sensible thing to do.

41
00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:19.768
Raymond stepped forward
and snatched the binoculars away.


42
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:21.726
"Who you spyin' on?" He snapped.

43
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.976
Peter Watson considered the possibilities.

44
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.768
He could turn and run,
but they'd catch him in seconds.


45
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:29.351
He could shout for help,
but no one would hear him.


46
00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:31.601
All he could do,
therefore, was to keep calm


47
00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:33.976
and try to talk his way
out of the situation.


48
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.476
"I was watching
a green woodpecker," Peter said.


49
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.726
"A what?"
"A male, green woodpecker." <i>Picus viridis.</i>


50
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.060
"He was tapping the trunk
of that dead tree, searching for grubs."


51
00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:45.101
"Where is he?"
Ernie said, raising his gun.


52
00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:47.393
"I'll 'ave 'im!"
"No, you won't," Peter said,


53
00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:50.476
looking at the string of birds
slung over Raymond's shoulder.


54
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.060
"He flew off the moment you shouted.
Woodpeckers are extremely timid."


55
00:02:59.851 --> 00:03:01.726
Raymond whispered in Ernie's ear.

56
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.143
Ernie slapped his thigh. "Great idea!"

57
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:06.935
He placed his gun on the ground
and advanced upon the small boy.


58
00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:08.435
He threw him to the ground.

59
00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:11.310
Raymond took out some string
and cut off a length of it.


60
00:03:11.393 --> 00:03:13.476
They tied Peter's wrists together tight.

61
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.101
"Now the legs," Raymond said.

62
00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:17.810
Peter struggled
and received a punch in the stomach.


63
00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:19.601
That winded him, and he lay still.

64
00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:22.101
The bigger boys
tied his ankles with more string,


65
00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:23.643
trussed him like a chicken.

66
00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:25.185
Ernie picked up his gun,

67
00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:28.476
and they began to carry the boy
towards the railway lines.


68
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.476
Peter Watson kept absolutely quiet.

69
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.351
Whatever they were up to,
talking wouldn't help matters.


70
00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:35.268
They dragged him down the embankment

71
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.435
and laid him lengthwise
between the tracks. These tracks here.


72
00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:41.643
These tracks right here.

73
00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:44.685
This happened to me 27 years ago.
My name is Peter Watson.


74
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:47.810
"More string," Ernie said.

75
00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:53.976
When they finished, 
Peter was helpless,

76
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.726
tied fast between the rails.

77
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.476
The only parts he could move
were his head and feet.


78
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.393
Ernie and Raymond stepped back
to survey their handiwork.


79
00:04:01.476 --> 00:04:03.393
"We done a nice job," Ernie said.

80
00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.351
"This is murder,"
said the boy lying between the rails.


81
00:04:06.435 --> 00:04:08.351
"Not for certain," said Ernie.

82
00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:10.393
"Depends how much clearance
the trains have."


83
00:04:10.476 --> 00:04:13.935
"You keep down flat,
you might just get away with it."


84
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:18.018
The bigger boys climbed up the embankment
and sat behind some bushes.


85
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:20.226
Ernie produced a pack of cigarettes.
They smoked.


86
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.518
Peter knew
they weren't going to release him.


87
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:24.518
These were dangerous, crazy boys.

88
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.060
Dangerous, crazy, stupid boys.

89
00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:29.893
"I must try to keep calm and think,"
Peter told himself.


90
00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:32.101
He lay there, still, weighing his chances.

91
00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:34.060
The highest part of
his head was his nose.

92
00:04:34.143 --> 00:04:37.810
He estimated his nose was sticking up
about four inches above the rails.


93
00:04:37.893 --> 00:04:40.476
Was that too much?
Hard to say with modern diesels.


94
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.601
His head rested
upon loose gravel between two sleepers.


95
00:04:43.685 --> 00:04:45.935
He must try to burrow down a little.

96
00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:48.851
He began to wriggle his head
pushing the gravel away


97
00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:51.643
and gradually making for himself
a small indentation.


98
00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:54.060
He reckoned
he'd lowered his head two inches.


99
00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:56.143
That would do. 
But what about the feet?

100
00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:59.060
He tucked them pigeon-toed
so they lay almost flat,


101
00:04:59.143 --> 00:05:00.851
then waited for the train to come.

102
00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:04.518
He wondered whether there might be
a vacuum created underneath the train


103
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:07.643
as it rushed over him,
sucking him upward. There might.


104
00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:09.226
He must concentrate everything

105
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.101
upon pressing his entire body
against the ground.


106
00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:15.935
"Don't go limp. Keep stiff and tense
and press down into the ground."


107
00:05:16.018 --> 00:05:18.143
Peter watched the white sky
above his head,


108
00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:21.018
where a single cumulus cloud
was drifting slowly.


109
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:22.851
An aeroplane came across the cloud.

110
00:05:22.935 --> 00:05:25.101
A small high-winged monoplane
with a red fuselage.


111
00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:29.268
An old Piper Cub, he thought it was.
He watched it until it disappeared.


112
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:30.476
Then, quite suddenly,

113
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.351
he heard a curious vibrating sound
coming from the rails either side of him.


114
00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:37.601
It was very soft, scarcely audible,
a tiny, thrumming whisper


115
00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:40.435
that seemed to be
coming along the rails from far away.


116
00:05:46.185 --> 00:05:48.935
Peter raised his head
and looked down the railway line


117
00:05:49.018 --> 00:05:51.143
that stretched for a mile in the distance,

118
00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.226
and saw the train.

119
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.226
First, only a black dot,
but as he kept his head raised,


120
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.810
the dot grew bigger and bigger

121
00:05:56.893 --> 00:05:59.268
and began to take shape
and was no longer a dot,


122
00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:02.560
but instead, the big, square,
blunt front-end of a diesel engine.


123
00:06:02.643 --> 00:06:05.101
Peter dropped his head
and pushed it down hard into the hole


124
00:06:05.185 --> 00:06:07.065
he'd dug in the gravel.

125
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:08.560
He pigeon-toed his feet flat.

126
00:06:08.643 --> 00:06:11.601
He shut his eyes tight
and pressed his body into the ground.


127
00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:14.476
The train came on with an explosive blast.

128
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.226
Like a gun went off in his head.

129
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.893
With the explosion
came a tearing, screaming wind


130
00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:22.351
like a hurricane blowing down his nostrils
and into his lungs.


131
00:06:22.435 --> 00:06:25.101
The noise was shattering.
The wind choked him.


132
00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:27.226
He felt as if
he were being eaten alive

133
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.143
and swallowed up in the belly
of a screaming, murderous monster.


134
00:06:31.226 --> 00:06:33.935
<i>And then it was over.
The train was gone.</i>


135
00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:36.518
Peter Watson opened his eyes
and saw the white sky


136
00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:39.101
and the big, white cloud
still drifting overhead.


137
00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:41.685
It was all over,
and he had done it.

138
00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:49.851
- Cut him loose.
- ...Ernie said.


139
00:06:49.935 --> 00:06:52.726
Raymond cut the strings
binding Peter to the rails.


140
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.143
"Undo his feet, but keep his hands tied."

141
00:06:55.226 --> 00:06:57.518
Raymond cut the strings around his ankles.

142
00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:00.643
"Oh, you're still a prisoner, matey,"
Ernie said.


143
00:07:00.726 --> 00:07:04.685
The two bigger boys marched Peter Watson
across the next field towards the lake.


144
00:07:04.768 --> 00:07:07.393
The prisoner's wrists
were still tied together.


145
00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:09.476
Ernie held the gun in his spare hand

146
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.476
and Raymond carried the binoculars
he had taken from Peter.


147
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:17.518
The lake was long and narrow

148
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:19.851
with tall willow trees
growing along its bank.


149
00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:21.726
In the middle, the water was clear,

150
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.268
but closer to the shore
was a forest of bulrushes.


151
00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:27.018
"Now, then," Ernie said.
"What I suggest is this."


152
00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:29.060
"You take his arms, 
I'll take his legs,

153
00:07:29.143 --> 00:07:33.060
and we'll swing him as far out as we can
over them nice muddy reeds."


154
00:07:33.143 --> 00:07:35.768
"Look!" Raymond interrupted.
"There! Let's have him!"


155
00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:37.851
Peter Watson turned and saw it at once.

156
00:07:37.935 --> 00:07:40.851
A nest consisting
of a huge pile of reeds and rushes


157
00:07:40.935 --> 00:07:43.060
that rose up two feet above the waterline.

158
00:07:43.143 --> 00:07:47.351
And, on top, a magnificent white swan
sitting serenely as the Lady of the Lake.


159
00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:50.851
Her head was turned towards the boys,
alert and watchful.


160
00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:53.310
"Holy cats!" cried Raymond.
"What a beauty!"


161
00:07:53.393 --> 00:07:56.851
Ernie let go of the prisoner's arm
and lifted the gun to his shoulder.


162
00:07:56.935 --> 00:08:00.476
"This is... This is a bird sanctuary,"
said Peter, stammering.


163
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.351
"A what?" asked Ernie.

164
00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:05.601
Peter felt a wild rage
beginning to build up inside him.


165
00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.393
He tried to keep his voice calm.

166
00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:09.810
"Swans are the most
protected birds in England,


167
00:08:09.893 --> 00:08:13.351
and nobody shoots a bird on its nest.
She may have cygnets under her."


168
00:08:13.435 --> 00:08:16.643
"Please don't do it. You can't do it.
Please, don't do it! Stop!"


169
00:08:18.226 --> 00:08:20.393
The bullet hit the swan
in her elegant head


170
00:08:20.476 --> 00:08:23.560
and her long white neck
sank slowly to the side of the nest.


171
00:08:33.935 --> 00:08:34.935
Open.

172
00:08:47.768 --> 00:08:50.143
"Cut his hands free, Raymond.
He's our gun-dog."


173
00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:53.101
Raymond cut the strings
binding the small boy's wrists.


174
00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:54.268
"Go get him!"

175
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:55.560
"I refuse," I said.

176
00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:59.518
Ernie hit Peter
across the face, hard, with his open hand.


177
00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:02.185
A trickle of blood
began running out of one nostril.


178
00:09:02.268 --> 00:09:05.851
"Try refusin' one more time,
and I'm goin' to make you a promise:


179
00:09:05.935 --> 00:09:08.768
I'll knock out every one
of your shiny white front teeth,


180
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:10.893
top and bottom. 
You understand that?"

181
00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:11.976
Peter said nothing.

182
00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:14.226
"Answer me!" Ernie barked.
"You understand?"


183
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.976
"Yes," Peter Watson said quietly.
"I understand that."


184
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:19.685
Tears were running down Peter's face

185
00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.101
as he went down the bank
and entered the water.


186
00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:25.768
He waded out to the dead swan
and picked it up tenderly with both hands.


187
00:09:25.851 --> 00:09:29.351
Underneath were two tiny cygnets,
their bodies covered with gray down.


188
00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:31.685
They were huddling
in the center of the nest.


189
00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:34.060
"Any eggs?" Ernie shouted from the bank.

190
00:09:38.685 --> 00:09:41.060
"No," Peter answered. "Nothing."

191
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.976
He carried the dead swan
back to the edge of the lake.


192
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.851
He placed it gently on the ground,
and he stood up and faced the two others.


193
00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:56.101
His eyes, still wet with tears,
were blazing with fury.


194
00:09:56.185 --> 00:09:58.601
"It's you who ought
to be dead," he said.

195
00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:02.101
Ernie seemed just a tiny bit taken aback,
but he quickly recovered.


196
00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:05.310
A dangerous little spark
danced in his small black eyes.


197
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.060
"Give me your knife, Raymond."

198
00:10:11.685 --> 00:10:14.601
There is a joint in the bone
where the wing meets the bird.


199
00:10:14.685 --> 00:10:18.185
Ernie slid the knife into the joint
and cut through the tendon.


200
00:10:18.268 --> 00:10:19.976
The knife was sharp and cut well,

201
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.393
and soon the wing came away
all in one piece.


202
00:10:22.476 --> 00:10:25.143
Ernie turned the swan over
and severed the other wing.


203
00:10:25.226 --> 00:10:27.726
"String," he said,
holding out his hand to Raymond.


204
00:10:30.268 --> 00:10:32.601
Ernie cut eight pieces,
each about a yard long.


205
00:10:32.685 --> 00:10:36.101
He tied the bits of string
along the top edge of the great wing.


206
00:10:36.185 --> 00:10:37.435
"Stick out your arms."

207
00:10:40.685 --> 00:10:43.143
Peter Watson stood in the sunshine
beside the lake


208
00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.768
on this beautiful May morning,

209
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:47.185
the enormous, limp,
slightly bloodied wings


210
00:10:47.268 --> 00:10:49.560
dangling grotesquely at his sides.

211
00:10:49.643 --> 00:10:52.643
Ernie clapped his hands
and danced a little jig on the grass.


212
00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:01.976
"Have you finished?" Peter Watson asked.

213
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.560
"Swans don't talk," Ernie said.

214
00:11:04.643 --> 00:11:08.643
They marched along the bank of the lake
until they came to a tall willow tree.


215
00:11:08.726 --> 00:11:10.851
The branches hung down from a great height

216
00:11:10.935 --> 00:11:13.435
until they almost touched
the surface of the lake.


217
00:11:14.143 --> 00:11:15.768
"What you're gonna do, Mr. Swan,

218
00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:18.018
is climb to the top,
and when you get there,


219
00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:20.393
you'll spread out your wings
and take off!"


220
00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:22.310
"Fantastic!" cried Raymond.

221
00:11:22.393 --> 00:11:23.810
The thought of being high up

222
00:11:23.893 --> 00:11:26.976
and out of reach of these hooligans
appealed to Peter greatly.


223
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.143
When he was up
there, he'd stay up there.

224
00:11:29.226 --> 00:11:31.726
He doubted
they would bother to come up after him.


225
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.143
If they did,
he could climb away on a thin limb


226
00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:36.393
that wouldn't take the weight
of two people.


227
00:11:36.476 --> 00:11:40.351
The tree was fairly easy to climb,
with low branches to give him a start up.


228
00:11:40.435 --> 00:11:42.351
"Higher!" shouted Ernie. "Keep going!"

229
00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:45.601
Peter eventually arrived at a point
where he could go no higher.


230
00:11:45.685 --> 00:11:48.726
His feet were standing
on a branch as thick as a man's wrist,


231
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.226
and this branch
reached far out over the lake,


232
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.101
then curved gracefully downward.

233
00:11:53.185 --> 00:11:55.143
He stood there resting after the climb.

234
00:11:55.226 --> 00:11:58.768
He was very high up, at least 50 feet.
He couldn't see the two boys.


235
00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:01.476
They were no longer
standing at the base of the tree.


236
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.726
"Now listen carefully!"

237
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.643
They had walked away from the tree

238
00:12:04.726 --> 00:12:08.060
to a point where they had a clear view
of the small boy at the top.


239
00:12:08.143 --> 00:12:09.393
Looking down at them now,

240
00:12:09.476 --> 00:12:11.643
Peter Watson realized
how sparse and slender


241
00:12:11.726 --> 00:12:13.393
the leaves of a willow tree were.

242
00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:15.351
They gave him almost no cover at all.

243
00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.393
"Start walking out along that branch!"

244
00:12:17.476 --> 00:12:21.351
"Keep goin' till you're out over
the nice muddy water! Then take off"


245
00:12:21.435 --> 00:12:23.185
Peter Watson didn't move.

246
00:12:23.268 --> 00:12:26.185
He kept his eyes on the distant figures
in the field below.


247
00:12:26.268 --> 00:12:28.726
They were standing quite still,
looking up at him.


248
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.018
"I'm gonna count to ten,

249
00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:33.810
if you ain't spread them wings
and flown away, I'm gonna shoot you down."


250
00:12:33.893 --> 00:12:36.351
"That'll make two swans
I've knocked off today."


251
00:12:36.435 --> 00:12:37.851
"Here we go."

252
00:12:37.935 --> 00:12:43.601
"One, two, three, four, five, six!"

253
00:12:43.685 --> 00:12:48.101
Peter Watson remained absolutely still.
Nothing would make him move from now on.


254
00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:51.435
"Seven, eight, nine, ten!"

255
00:12:51.518 --> 00:12:53.976
Peter could see the gun
coming up to the shoulder.


256
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.435
Pointing straight at him.

257
00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:57.101
He heard the crack of the rifle

258
00:12:57.185 --> 00:12:59.935
and the zip of the bullet
as it whistled past his head.


259
00:13:03.268 --> 00:13:05.226
It was frightening, but he didn't move.

260
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.601
He could see Ernie loading the gun.

261
00:13:07.685 --> 00:13:10.768
"Last chance!" yelled Ernie.
"Next one's gonna get you!"


262
00:13:10.851 --> 00:13:11.685
Peter waited.

263
00:13:11.768 --> 00:13:13.476
He watched the boy among the buttercups

264
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.976
in the meadow far below
with the other boy beside him.


265
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.185
The gun came up
once again to the shoulder.


266
00:13:18.268 --> 00:13:21.560
This time he heard the crack
as the bullet hit him in the thigh.


267
00:13:21.643 --> 00:13:24.351
There was no pain,
but the force of it was devastating.


268
00:13:24.435 --> 00:13:27.143
Like someone had whacked him
with a sledgehammer,


269
00:13:27.226 --> 00:13:30.143
and it knocked both feet
off the branch he was standing on.


270
00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:32.185
He scrabbled with his hands to hang on.

271
00:13:32.268 --> 00:13:35.476
The small branch he was holding onto
bent over and split.


272
00:13:44.643 --> 00:13:46.768
Some people, when they have taken too much

273
00:13:46.851 --> 00:13:49.101
and been driven
beyond the point of endurance,


274
00:13:49.185 --> 00:13:51.726
simply crumble and collapse and give up.

275
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.976
Others, however, though they are not many,

276
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.601
who will for some reason
always be unconquerable.


277
00:13:57.685 --> 00:14:00.976
You meet them in time of war
and also in time of peace.


278
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.101
They have an indomitable spirit

279
00:14:03.185 --> 00:14:06.685
and nothing, neither pain
nor torture nor threat of death,


280
00:14:06.768 --> 00:14:08.893
will cause them to give up.

281
00:14:08.976 --> 00:14:11.435
Little Peter Watson was one of these.

282
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.018
And as he fought and scrabbled

283
00:14:13.101 --> 00:14:16.101
to prevent himself
from falling out of the top of that tree,


284
00:14:16.185 --> 00:14:19.976
it came to him suddenly
that he was going to win.


285
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.226
He looked up and saw a light
shining over the waters of the lake


286
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.893
that was of such brilliance and beauty
he was unable to look away from it.


287
00:14:27.976 --> 00:14:31.226
The light was beckoning him,
drawing him on,


288
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.226
and he dived towards the light
and spread his wings.


289
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.976
Three different people
reported seeing a great white swan


290
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.143
circling over the village that morning:

291
00:14:42.226 --> 00:14:43.226
a schoolteacher,

292
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.101
a man replacing tiles
on the roof of the chemist's shop,


293
00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:48.518
and a boy playing in a nearby field.

294
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:51.601
Mrs. Watson,
washing dishes in her kitchen sink,


295
00:14:51.685 --> 00:14:54.851
happened to glance up
through the window at the exact moment


296
00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:57.351
something huge and white
came crashing down


297
00:14:57.435 --> 00:14:59.976
onto the lawn in her back garden.

298
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.726
She rushed outside.

299
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.018
She dropped to her knees

300
00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:05.685
beside the small crumpled figure
of her only son.


301
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.560
