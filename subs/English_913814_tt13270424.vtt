there were two wires
in Charles's head

while I was out--

Mr. Williams, the mouse,
came along,


379

walked along one of the wires,

380
00:22:18.934 --> 00:22:21.699

seesawed the wire

A vegetable crop
with dense leaved heads.


406
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.233
Cabbage weights
will generally range


407
00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:19.934
from 500 to 1,000 grams.

408
00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:21.366
The most common are
smooth-leaved,


409
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.867
firm-headed green cabbages,

410

while smooth-leaved
purple cabbages


411
00:23:24.867 --> 00:23:26.632
and crinkle-leaved
savoy cabbages


412
00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:28.101
are considerably rarer.

413
00:23:28.134 --> 00:23:31.700
The heaviest cabbage ever found
was 62.71 kilograms.


414
00:23:31.733 --> 00:23:33.333
Under conditions
of long, sunny days,


415

such as those found...

How did you learn how to do it?


794
00:39:49.067 --> 00:39:50.233
BRIAN:
My dad.


795
00:39:50.266 --> 00:39:52.000
-CHARLES: Dad?
-Yeah. Dad.


796
00:39:52.034 --> 00:39:54.134
CHARLES:
What else did he teach you?


797
00:39:54.167 --> 00:39:55.699
BRIAN:
Oh, blimey.


798
00:39:55.733 --> 00:39:57.067
Uh, loads of things.

799
00:39:57.101 --> 00:39:59.233
CHARLES: Can you teach me
loads of things, too?


800
00:39:59.266 --> 00:40:01.400
BRIAN:
Yeah, course I can.


801
00:40:01.433 --> 00:40:03.632
CHARLES: Can you teach me
how to water-ski?


802
00:40:03.666 --> 00:40:04.967
BRIAN:
What?


803
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.266
CHARLES: I read about it
in a sports magazine.


804
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.400
BRIAN:
What sports magazine?


805
00:40:09.433 --> 00:40:11.733
(music plays softly over TV)

806
00:40:11.767 --> 00:40:13.767
BRIAN:
Grub's up. There you go.


807
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.967
-Grub's... Grub's up.
-Grub's up.


808
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.067
There you go.

809
00:40:17.101 --> 00:40:19.632
Nice, big cabbage.

810
00:40:19.666 --> 00:40:21.300
(Brian sighs)

811
00:40:21.333 --> 00:40:23.400
You watching telly?

812
00:40:23.433 --> 00:40:25.000
CHARLES:
Telly.


813
00:40:25.034 --> 00:40:27.733
Plural noun: tellies.

814
00:40:27.767 --> 00:40:30.134
Another term for television.

815
00:40:30.167 --> 00:40:33.667
Example: There has been
a cowboy film on telly.


816
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.900
(laughing):
There's been a cowboy...


817
00:40:35.934 --> 00:40:40.134
I've got to say,
I'm enjoying this magic moment.


818
00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:42.934
Good. I'm glad you are.

819
00:40:42.967 --> 00:40:45.233
I've done you some
sponge fingers for afterwards.


820
00:40:45.266 --> 00:40:46.834
Yumsville.

821
00:40:46.867 --> 00:40:48.834
But first, a destination
that for years


822
00:40:48.867 --> 00:40:51.300
has been synonymous
with exotic travel.


823
00:40:51.333 --> 00:40:53.800
Honolulu in Hawaii.

824
00:40:53.834 --> 00:40:57.101
Now, there is so much to do
in Honolulu.


825
00:40:57.134 --> 00:40:58.667
Everything from snorkeling to...

826
00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.233
Where is that, please?

827
00:41:00.266 --> 00:41:02.233
(over TV): ...horseback riding
to helicopter tours,


828
00:41:02.266 --> 00:41:04.101
it really is the perfect place

829
00:41:04.133 --> 00:41:06.700
for sun, sea, adventure,
thrills and spills.


830
00:41:06.733 --> 00:41:08.133
-Where, Brian?
-BRIAN: Honolulu.


831
00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:10.834
Put your head down
while you have your dinner.


832
00:41:10.867 --> 00:41:12.633
(over TV):
In tropical Honolulu...


833
00:41:12.667 --> 00:41:14.834
What is it called again, please?

834
00:41:14.867 --> 00:41:16.967
Honolulu.

835
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.133
-Hunna-loy-loy.
-(chuckles): No.


836
00:41:19.166 --> 00:41:20.366
Honolulu.

837
00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.333
-Honey-lay-lay.
-(Brian laughs)


838
00:41:22.366 --> 00:41:23.834
BRIAN:
It's Honolulu.


839
00:41:23.867 --> 00:41:26.034
CHARLES:
Hono-loop-loop.


840
00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:27.633
(Hawaiian music playing)

841
00:41:29.767 --> 00:41:31.101
What are you doing?

842
00:41:31.133 --> 00:41:32.700
Let's go there, Brian.

843
00:41:32.733 --> 00:41:35.700
It's hotter than here,
and it looks wonderful.


844
00:41:35.733 --> 00:41:38.800
Will you sit down, please?

845
00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.900
CHARLES:
I want to go to Hono-la-la.


846
00:41:41.934 --> 00:41:44.667
Not now, you don't.
You're having your dinner.


847
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.233
Horses and helicopters, please.

848
00:41:46.266 --> 00:41:48.400
You sit down
and have your dinner.


849
00:41:48.433 --> 00:41:50.400
-No.
-I beg your pardon?


850
00:41:50.433 --> 00:41:52.700
-I don't want to sit down.
-Charles.


851
00:41:52.733 --> 00:41:54.934
I want to go to Honol.

852
00:41:54.967 --> 00:41:57.333
Can we park
this Honolulu chatter, please,


853
00:41:57.366 --> 00:42:00.200
and sit down and eat our dinner?

854
00:42:00.233 --> 00:42:01.900
(laughs)

855
00:42:01.934 --> 00:42:03.266
(over TV):
So come along and experience...


856
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.067
CHARLES:
Okay.


857
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.400
Bossy boots.

858
00:42:06.433 --> 00:42:08.400
Let's see what's on
the other side.


859
00:42:08.433 --> 00:42:09.967
-(over TV): Best wishes...
-(changes channel)


860
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.733
HOST (over TV):
...one and only Gary Barlow!


861
00:42:11.767 --> 00:42:14.600
-Oh, I like him.
-(cheering over TV)


862
00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:17.633

(door closes)

866
00:42:31.266 --> 00:42:33.767
EDDIE: Packet of Ringwald's
Gold, will you, please, June?


867
00:42:34.867 --> 00:42:36.400
JUNE:

868
00:42:36.433 --> 00:42:38.934
And a cherry and almond
nougat bar.


869
00:42:39.967 --> 00:42:42.233
I see the bonfire's
coming along.


870
00:42:42.266 --> 00:42:44.633
It's a big one this year.

871
00:42:46.166 --> 00:42:48.100
The...?

872
00:42:48.133 --> 00:42:50.066
JUNE:
Sorry?


873
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.066
The bonfire?

874
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.366
My bonfire, June.

875
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.700
JUNE: Well, I didn't mean
anything by that.


876
00:42:55.733 --> 00:42:58.200
I'm in charge of
the bonfires round here.


877
00:42:58.233 --> 00:43:00.000
-Sorry.
-Yeah.


878
00:43:00.033 --> 00:43:03.834
That's nine pound, uh, 60,
I think, Eddie.


879
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:10.600
Or, uh, shall I just
put it on your slate?


880
00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.133
Yeah.

881
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.733
Yeah, I reckon
you should do that.


882
00:43:16.767 --> 00:43:18.600
(objects clattering)

883

(thunder rumbling)

884
00:43:22.867 --> 00:43:25.200
What you doing over there?

885
00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:29.667
Browsing around. Browsing.

886
00:43:31.867 --> 00:43:34.700
-Browsing, is it?
-Yeah.


887
00:43:34.733 --> 00:43:36.700
Is there much to browse
in here, is there?


888
00:43:36.733 --> 00:43:38.999
Yeah. This shelf isn't bad.

889
00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:42.166
Sneaking around, uh, with
his little table tennis bat.


890
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.967
Were you playing table tennis
on your own again?


891
00:43:44.999 --> 00:43:46.700
(chuckles)

892
00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:48.667
No.

893
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.100
Browsing Away Brian.

894
00:43:50.133 --> 00:43:51.767
Brian the Browser.

895
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.733
That's what they call him.
Well, they used to call him


896
00:43:53.767 --> 00:43:55.266
other things, didn't they?
(laughs)


897
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.700
There you are.

898
00:43:57.733 --> 00:43:59.633
-Whoops.
-(June gasps)


899
00:43:59.667 --> 00:44:01.700
You should probably pick
those up for June, I reckon.

00:44:01.733 --> 00:44:03.166
BRIAN:
Yeah, I will do.

(door opens, bell jingles)

902
00:44:05.733 --> 00:44:07.233
JUNE: You don't
have to do that, Brian.


903
00:44:07.266 --> 00:44:08.999
Oh, it's all right.

BRIAN (singsongy):
Charles.


907
00:44:17.867 --> 00:44:20.834
I've got a pressie for you.

908

I've got a present.

Charles!

917
00:44:52.366 --> 00:44:54.867
-CHARLES: Oh, no.
-You stop now.


918
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.200
What are you doing?
What are you doing?


919
00:44:57.233 --> 00:44:58.834
I am going to Hanali-alu-lu.

920
00:44:58.867 --> 00:45:00.899
Don't be silly,
going to Honolulu.

Honestly, what are you wearing?

922
00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:04.667
It's my Hawaiian hula skirt.

923
00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.767
Oh, you're being daft.
You're being daft.


924
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.333
You're soaking.
Look at my best brown shoes.

I am going to Hono-loop-loop.

No, no, you're not going
to Hono-loop-loop.

-You're coming with me.
-Let go, man.

-Don't pull me.
-I want to go to Hono-loop-loop.


929
00:45:18.066 --> 00:45:20.233
No, you're not going, Charles.
Come with me.


930
00:45:20.266 --> 00:45:21.966
You live with me in the cottage.

931
00:45:21.999 --> 00:45:24.366
-But I want to go.
-Honestly.


932
00:45:24.401 --> 00:45:26.333
Why won't you let me go, Brian?

933
00:45:26.366 --> 00:45:28.233
I want to dance on the beach.

934
00:45:28.266 --> 00:45:29.834
It's miles away.

935
00:45:29.867 --> 00:45:32.200
I know. That's why I want to go.

936
00:45:32.233 --> 00:45:34.033
You'd miss me, wouldn't you?

he wanted to get a taxi to town,

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.100
Wakey-wakey.

953
00:46:53.301 --> 00:46:54.899
Charles?

954
00:46:56.733 --> 00:46:58.833
Oi. Wake up.

955
00:46:58.866 --> 00:47:00.266
Wake up.

956
00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:03.233
Huh? Come on.

957
00:47:03.266 --> 00:47:05.367
CHARLES:
What do you want now?


958
00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:08.166
Don't talk to me like that.
(chuckles)


959
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.334
I just wondered if you wanted
to go into the village.


960
00:47:11.367 --> 00:47:13.200
Who with?

961
00:47:13.233 --> 00:47:14.833
With me.

962
00:47:14.866 --> 00:47:17.133
You said I wasn't allowed,
Brian.


963
00:47:17.166 --> 00:47:20.133
Yeah, well, I've changed
my mind just this once.


964
00:47:20.166 --> 00:47:21.966
I'll walk in and meet you there.

965
00:47:21.999 --> 00:47:24.367
You will not walk in
and meet me there.


966
00:47:24.401 --> 00:47:26.301
You'll come with me
in the truck,


967
00:47:26.334 --> 00:47:28.700
or you won't go at all.

968
00:47:28.733 --> 00:47:31.667
-Whatever.
-Don't say "whatever."


969
00:47:33.033 --> 00:47:34.899
CHARLES:
What...


970
00:47:38.966 --> 00:47:40.999
...ever.

971
00:47:45.866 --> 00:47:47.766
(sighs)

972
00:47:51.066 --> 00:47:54.033
BRIAN: What you doing?
Why are you wearing that?


973
00:47:54.066 --> 00:47:55.766
I feel pretty cool.

974
00:47:55.799 --> 00:47:57.633
Not in my old curtains,
you don't.


975
00:47:57.667 --> 00:48:00.133
Put something else on. Hoopla!

976
00:48:01.234 --> 00:48:03.200
CHARLES:
Spoilsport.


977
00:48:07.334 --> 00:48:09.133
How's he done that?

978
00:48:17.933 --> 00:48:19.600
Okay.

979
00:48:21.933 --> 00:48:23.334
Come on, then.

980
00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:25.234
Are we going to the shops,
Brian?


981
00:48:25.267 --> 00:48:26.799
Yes, we are going to the shops.

982
00:48:26.833 --> 00:48:28.334
Now, do as you're told, okay?

983
00:48:28.367 --> 00:48:30.367
There are some things
that I need.


984
00:48:30.401 --> 00:48:31.899
Things you need?

985
00:48:31.933 --> 00:48:34.367
I'd like a map of the world
for my wall.


986
00:48:34.401 --> 00:48:36.033
Right, okay.
Well, maybe not today,


987
00:48:36.066 --> 00:48:37.966
'cause I've got stuff to do,
but...


988
00:48:37.999 --> 00:48:39.799
And some soap.

989
00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:42.166
-Soap?
-And some cotton socks.


990
00:48:42.201 --> 00:48:43.699
Cotton socks?

991
00:48:43.732 --> 00:48:44.966
And I want to sit
in the front, Brian.


992
00:48:44.999 --> 00:48:46.799
No, you're not sitting
in the front.


993
00:48:46.833 --> 00:48:47.966
You're sitting in the back.
You're not old enough.


994
00:48:47.999 --> 00:48:49.966
I want to go
in the front, Brian.


995
00:48:49.999 --> 00:48:52.766
You're not old enough
to go in the front.


996
00:48:52.799 --> 00:48:55.301
I want you in the back.

997
00:48:55.334 --> 00:48:57.766
-Front.
-Not front.


998
00:48:57.799 --> 00:48:59.766
I will sit in the front, Brian.

999
00:48:59.799 --> 00:49:02.100
You will not sit in the front.
You'll sit in the back.


1000
00:49:02.133 --> 00:49:04.367
Maybe I could drive
and you could walk, Brian.


1001
00:49:04.401 --> 00:49:08.100
You have got a very,
very cheeky brain,


1002
00:49:08.133 --> 00:49:10.234
and I don't like it.

1003
00:49:10.267 --> 00:49:12.066
I don't know
what's got into you.


1004
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.401
It's the same blue eye
but a different attitude.


1005
00:49:15.434 --> 00:49:18.367
A very, very cheeky robot.

1006
00:49:18.401 --> 00:49:19.899
Cheeky?

1007
00:49:19.933 --> 00:49:21.234
Cheeky, yes.

1008
00:49:21.267 --> 00:49:24.066
-Cheeky bot.
-Cheeky bot?


1009
00:49:25.267 --> 00:49:26.966
Cheeky bot sit
in the front, Brian.


1010
00:49:26.999 --> 00:49:28.766
Stop saying "front."

1011
00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.966
Front, front, front,
front, front,


1012
00:49:30.999 --> 00:49:33.434
front, front,
front, front, front.


1013
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:39.699
-Are we there yet?
-No.


1014
00:49:39.732 --> 00:49:42.100
If you're good,
I'll take you to the lake.


1015
00:49:42.134 --> 00:49:43.833
-CHARLES: Lake?
-Yes.


1016
00:49:43.866 --> 00:49:45.699
I need to quickly stop
at the shop, okay?


1017
00:49:45.732 --> 00:49:47.966
-I'll come as well
and say hello. -No, you won't.


1018
00:49:47.999 --> 00:49:51.301
You've got to stay in the truck
and keep your head down.


1019
00:49:51.334 --> 00:49:54.234
Can we go to
the swimming pool, Brian?


1020
00:49:54.267 --> 00:49:56.899
BRIAN: Swimming pool?
There is no swimming pool.


1021
00:49:56.933 --> 00:49:58.732
CHARLES:
Can we go to the airport?


1022
00:49:58.766 --> 00:50:00.666
BRIAN:
There is no airport.


1023
00:50:00.699 --> 00:50:02.301
CHARLES:
Can we go to the zoo, Brian?


1024
00:50:02.334 --> 00:50:03.933
BRIAN:
There is no zoo.


1025
00:50:03.966 --> 00:50:06.966
There's a kennels.
That's just dogs.


1026
00:50:07.799 --> 00:50:10.201
-CHARLES: Dogs?
-Yes, dogs.


1027
00:50:11.167 --> 00:50:12.833
Right.

1028
00:50:12.866 --> 00:50:14.699
I won't be long, okay?

1029
00:50:14.732 --> 00:50:17.599
(whispers):
Don't do anything. Right?


1030
00:50:38.367 --> 00:50:40.766
(sheep bleating)

1031
00:50:51.267 --> 00:50:52.966
Hello.

1032
00:50:55.334 --> 00:50:57.301
I am Charles Petrescu.

1033
00:50:57.334 --> 00:50:59.599
Who are you, please?

1034
00:51:00.234 --> 00:51:02.101
H
-Hazel.

1035
00:51:02.134 --> 00:51:05.034
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Hazel.


1036
00:51:06.267 --> 00:51:08.167
What, uh... (chuckles softly)

1037
00:51:08.201 --> 00:51:09.666
What are you?

1038
00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:12.234
I am Charles Petrescu.

1039
00:51:13.134 --> 00:51:15.833
Do you live in the fields
with the sheep?


1040
00:51:15.866 --> 00:51:19.067
No, I live in the village
with my mum and a parrot.


1041
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:23.833
Parrot: an exotic jungle bird
known for its flamboyant colors.


1042
00:51:23.866 --> 00:51:26.999
Characteristic features include
a strong, curved bill.


1043
00:51:27.034 --> 00:51:28.966
HAZEL: Yes, he's green,
and he's got red shoul...


1044
00:51:28.999 --> 00:51:32.632
CHARLES: Did you know
the most important components


1045
00:51:32.666 --> 00:51:35.101
of most parrots' diets
are seeds?


1046
00:51:36.766 --> 00:51:38.599
Please don't tell anyone.

1047
00:51:39.699 --> 00:51:42.899
-Please.
-I-I won't. I won't.


1048
00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.367
What is he?

1049
00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:45.833
A robot.

1050
00:51:45.866 --> 00:51:47.666
CHARLES:
I am Charles Petrescu.


1051
00:51:47.699 --> 00:51:49.367
HAZEL:
Did you build him, Brian?


1052
00:51:49.401 --> 00:51:51.134
Yeah.

1053
00:51:51.167 --> 00:51:53.833
CHARLES: We're going
to the lake for a walk.


1054
00:51:53.866 --> 00:51:55.167
Oh, I
-I'm... I'm sorry.

1055
00:51:55.201 --> 00:51:56.833
-I didn't mean to...
-BRIAN: No, no, no, no.


1056
00:51:56.866 --> 00:51:58.367
I'm sorry.
No, we're-we're just going...


1057
00:51:58.401 --> 00:52:00.000
we were just going for
a mooch about. Charles.


1058
00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:01.866
Is Hazel coming?

1059
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.367
(laughs)

1060
00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:05.933
No.

1061
00:52:05.966 --> 00:52:08.334
CHARLES: You should ask her
to come to the lake.


1062
00:52:08.367 --> 00:52:10.000
Very busy.

1063
00:52:10.899 --> 00:52:13.367
CHARLES: She doesn't look
like she is busy.


1064
00:52:13.401 --> 00:52:15.933
She'll want to come to the lake.

1065
00:52:15.967 --> 00:52:17.632
Uh...

1066
00:52:20.367 --> 00:52:22.101
Do you want to? (chuckles)

1067
00:52:22.134 --> 00:52:23.632
Do you want to come?

1068
00:52:23.666 --> 00:52:26.866
Well, is that all right?

1069
00:52:30.034 --> 00:52:31.666
(birds chirping)

1070
00:52:31.699 --> 00:52:33.732
HAZEL: How did you know
how to build him?


1071
00:52:33.766 --> 00:52:36.367
I wouldn't know where to start.

1072
00:52:36.401 --> 00:52:38.833
Don't know.
Just start at the beginning


1073
00:52:38.866 --> 00:52:40.967
and use your imagination,
I suppose.


1074
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.201
(Hazel chuckles)

1075
00:52:42.234 --> 00:52:44.699
CHARLES: Would you like a game
of "kick the stone," Brian?


1076
00:52:44.732 --> 00:52:47.101
BRIAN: No, no, no,
I'm talking to Hazel now, okay?


1077
00:52:47.134 --> 00:52:49.067
All right?

1078
00:52:49.101 --> 00:52:50.833
CHARLES:
Oh.


1079
00:52:50.866 --> 00:52:52.699
-Sorry.
-(chuckles)


1080
00:52:52.732 --> 00:52:55.766
HAZEL:
It's so nice to be out.


1081
00:52:55.799 --> 00:52:58.000
I hardly ever see you
around town.


1082
00:52:58.034 --> 00:52:59.934
I'm
-I'm quite busy.

1083
00:52:59.967 --> 00:53:01.666
Yeah. Busy bee.

1084
00:53:01.699 --> 00:53:02.866
Busy bee. Busy beaver.

1085
00:53:02.899 --> 00:53:05.632
-(laughing)
-Busy beaver.


1086
00:53:09.967 --> 00:53:11.599
Brian.

1087
00:53:12.267 --> 00:53:14.766
Charles, don't put your...
Sorry.


1088
00:53:14.799 --> 00:53:16.699
Charles, don't put your feet
in the water.


1089
00:53:16.732 --> 00:53:18.732
CHARLES:
I want to swim across the lake


1090
00:53:18.766 --> 00:53:20.234
and check out the other side.

1091
00:53:20.267 --> 00:53:22.334
BRIAN: Don't be ridiculous,
swim across the lake.


1092
00:53:22.367 --> 00:53:23.967
-You'd sink.
-I would not.


1093
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.766
BRIAN:
You can't go for a swim.


1094
00:53:25.799 --> 00:53:27.699
We're going for walkie-walkies.

1095
00:53:27.732 --> 00:53:29.666
CHARLES:
You and Hazel can do your thing,


1096
00:53:29.699 --> 00:53:31.632
-and I'll do my thing.
-No. Come on.


1097
00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:33.067
CHARLES:
It's not fair.


1098
00:53:33.101 --> 00:53:36.134
BRIAN: Life's not fair.
Now, over here. Come on.


1099
00:53:36.167 --> 00:53:38.201
Hoopla!

1100
00:53:38.234 --> 00:53:39.699
Come on. (whistles)

1101
00:53:39.732 --> 00:53:41.234
-Sorry.
-(Hazel chuckling)


1102
00:53:41.267 --> 00:53:43.666
His toes get all wet and...

1103
00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.666
I can't believe you made him.

1104
00:53:47.699 --> 00:53:49.833
You should show him to people.

1105
00:53:49.867 --> 00:53:51.167
Why not?

1106
00:53:51.201 --> 00:53:53.000
