1
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:55.944
No, don't!

2
00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:58.046
Stop it!
Step off! Step back!


3
00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:08.056
Fuck!

4
00:01:43.193 --> 00:01:46.261
This is yours now!
This is your life!


5
00:01:47.997 --> 00:01:50.499
What use are you?!

6
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.504
This ain't worth it!

7
00:01:55.506 --> 00:01:58.340
- Fuck it!

8
00:01:58.342 --> 00:02:01.109
Fuck everyone!

9
00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:07.609
It's fine.

10
00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:12.481
I mean, you want me
to call anyone?


11
00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:17.052
Nah, no, no. I...

12
00:03:17.687 --> 00:03:19.021
Just have to, uh...

13
00:03:19.023 --> 00:03:21.757
Won't be here long. Um...

14
00:03:27.664 --> 00:03:28.664
Clover, you're...

15
00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:29.898
No, I
-I'm fine.

16
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.500
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.


17
00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:34.202
Well, let me know
about the funeral, won't you?


18
00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:40.475
Yeah, of course.

19
00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:43.845
Now, if there's
anything else I can do...


20
00:03:43.847 --> 00:03:46.915
Can you make it my dad
instead of my brother?


21
00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:49.117
Can you make that happen?

22
00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:54.222
Just trying to help, clover.

23
00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:03.051
Right, then. Take care.

24
00:06:11.994 --> 00:06:13.061
You...

25
00:06:14.764 --> 00:06:16.665
You came!

26
00:06:18.534 --> 00:06:20.869
Bloody good show, clover.

27
00:06:22.405 --> 00:06:24.573
Well done, that girl.

28
00:06:26.442 --> 00:06:28.410
What's all the mess?

29
00:06:28.412 --> 00:06:30.078
Did you have a party?

30
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.079
Yes.

31
00:06:31.081 --> 00:06:33.548
Yes, for Harry.

32
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:34.852
Why?

33
00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:39.621
Well, his taking over the farm.

34
00:06:39.623 --> 00:06:41.089
Harry didn't tell me

35
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:42.457
you'd given him the farm.

36
00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:43.825
You... you didn't
want to come,


37
00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:47.863
did you, to the party?
You never want to come.


38
00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:51.199
Well, you're here now.

39
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:53.134
Stay for the funeral.

40
00:06:54.403 --> 00:06:56.037
Of course.

41
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.844
What's this?

42
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.347
Home.

43
00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.148
Since when?

44
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.284
Since the house flooded.

45
00:07:09.286 --> 00:07:12.153
Our very own refugee camp.

46
00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:13.955
But that was months ago.

47
00:07:13.957 --> 00:07:17.225
Bloody insurance company
wouldn't pay out.


48
00:07:37.113 --> 00:07:38.213
What happened?

49
00:07:39.483 --> 00:07:41.283
Helen wouldn't say.

50
00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:50.258
He took...

51
00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:53.962
He was...

52
00:07:58.235 --> 00:08:00.168
Oh, gun in the loo.

53
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.236
But...

54
00:08:01.238 --> 00:08:03.138
Everyone was plastered.

55
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.439
He shot himself?

56
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:05.941
It was a bloody stupid accident.

57
00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:09.110
Hello. Aubrey?

58
00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:15.250
Oh, James.

59
00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:23.992
Just wanted to check...

60
00:08:25.294 --> 00:08:27.729
See if you needed anything.

61
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:30.198
Isn't he wonderful, clover?

62
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.734
James came to check on us.

63
00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:35.737
He's a rock, a bloody rock.

64
00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:38.239
Has anyone heard a forecast?

65
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:41.343
I'm sure they said
it was gonna rain.


66
00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:42.344
You hear that, James?

67
00:08:42.346 --> 00:08:43.712
Yes, sir.

68
00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:46.448
Probably think about
digging some ditches,


69
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:47.649
shouldn't we?

70
00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:50.352
I can talk
to some of the others.


71
00:08:50.354 --> 00:08:51.853
Good boy.

72
00:09:08.137 --> 00:09:10.171
Aubrey said it was an accident.

73
00:09:20.416 --> 00:09:21.783
What did the police say?

74
00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:23.818
Did they find a note?

75
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.087
You know as much as I do.

76
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.857
Was it still loaded?

77
00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:30.425
I didn't know
it was still loaded.


78
00:09:30.427 --> 00:09:31.459
Well, it must have been.

79
00:09:31.461 --> 00:09:32.927
It blew his face off.

80
00:09:41.437 --> 00:09:43.304
Can you pull over?

81
00:09:49.478 --> 00:09:51.279
Pull over now.

82
00:10:14.637 --> 00:10:16.071
Sorry.

83
00:10:16.806 --> 00:10:18.473
It's fine.

84
00:12:05.548 --> 00:12:07.415
Oh, Harry.

85
00:13:18.153 --> 00:13:19.988
Milo?

86
00:13:29.966 --> 00:13:31.966
What are you doing in there?

87
00:13:55.824 --> 00:13:56.958
Aubrey?

88
00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:06.434
Clever boy, Milo.

89
00:14:15.411 --> 00:14:18.012
Oh. Bloody animal.

90
00:14:18.014 --> 00:14:19.847
Wonder where he got to.

91
00:14:19.849 --> 00:14:22.116
He was locked in the shed.

92
00:14:22.118 --> 00:14:25.453
Must have been in there
for days. He was starving.


93
00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:28.356
There was shit everywhere.

94
00:14:28.358 --> 00:14:30.191
What was he doing in there?

95
00:14:30.193 --> 00:14:32.894
Can't find a shirt.

96
00:14:34.163 --> 00:14:36.030
Did you put him in there?

97
00:14:36.032 --> 00:14:37.865
No, I bloody didn't.

98
00:14:37.867 --> 00:14:40.435
If we get an animal
like that at the practice,


99
00:14:40.437 --> 00:14:42.270
Aubrey, we call the police.

100
00:14:42.272 --> 00:14:46.474
Oh, perhaps someone
shut him in during the party.


101
00:14:46.476 --> 00:14:49.744
He's a bugger around sausages.

102
00:14:52.681 --> 00:14:54.549
Look, we've got
to sort out this funeral.


103
00:14:54.551 --> 00:14:56.651
Um, the morgue wants to know

104
00:14:56.653 --> 00:15:00.188
about the, uh, date
and our wishes...


105
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.422
- Later.
- So...


106
00:15:01.424 --> 00:15:03.725
We need to milk the cows.

107
00:15:05.094 --> 00:15:06.861
Get your wellies on.

108
00:15:08.831 --> 00:15:11.499
I didn't bring any wellies!

109
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.160
Come on!

110
00:15:39.162 --> 00:15:40.962
Come on!

111
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.965
Come on!

112
00:15:43.967 --> 00:15:45.233
Go on.

113
00:15:46.235 --> 00:15:47.802
Hey!

114
00:15:49.038 --> 00:15:50.138
Come on.

115
00:16:07.022 --> 00:16:09.857
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait. Wait.


116
00:16:31.513 --> 00:16:34.449
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

117
00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:36.918
Get it straight. See?

118
00:16:38.153 --> 00:16:39.187
Spread 'em out.

119
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:40.288
Right hand. Right hand.

120
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.290
You remember.

121
00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:51.766
Yeah, feel for it. Feel for it.

122
00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:33.694
Ah, come on.

123
00:19:46.642 --> 00:19:48.342
Milo.

124
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.308
Should I take these ones
back to the field?


125
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.943
No, into the barn.

126
00:20:55.945 --> 00:20:57.311
What? Why?

127
00:20:57.313 --> 00:20:59.280
Hatfield's coming
to take them away.


128
00:20:59.282 --> 00:21:01.349
You selling stock?
How many?


129
00:21:01.351 --> 00:21:04.452
Just half the herd.

130
00:21:04.454 --> 00:21:07.188
Keep some bloodline.
Build it up again.


131
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.357
But you're keeping
the pregnant ones?


132
00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:11.492
No. He's taking those.

133
00:21:11.494 --> 00:21:13.361
Well, I hope you're
getting double the price.


134
00:21:13.363 --> 00:21:14.829
It's all sorted.

135
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:18.232
You don't have to worry
your little head about it.


136
00:21:27.142 --> 00:21:29.243
They're here
in the barn waiting.


137
00:21:29.245 --> 00:21:32.012
Thought you said noon.
Don't think I'm wrong.


138
00:21:32.014 --> 00:21:34.348
Call me back. Cheers, Roger.

139
00:21:38.687 --> 00:21:41.055
Was this Harry's idea?

140
00:21:41.057 --> 00:21:42.857
The sale?

141
00:21:43.892 --> 00:21:44.892
Need the money.

142
00:21:46.896 --> 00:21:48.529
The stock is our only asset.

143
00:21:48.531 --> 00:21:51.899
We sell the stock.
We get the money.


144
00:21:51.901 --> 00:21:53.801
The farm is saved.

145
00:21:53.803 --> 00:21:55.736
Harry gets the farm.

146
00:21:55.738 --> 00:21:58.439
We have a party.
Everyone's happy.


147
00:22:01.843 --> 00:22:04.011
I don't think Harry was happy.

148
00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:11.752
It was just
a bloody stupid accident.


149
00:22:13.689 --> 00:22:15.222
Catto here.

150
00:22:15.224 --> 00:22:17.458
Yeah. That's right.

151
00:22:17.993 --> 00:22:19.760
Canceled? What?

152
00:22:21.096 --> 00:22:23.297
Yeah, well, Harry was in charge,

153
00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:25.766
but he should have
run that by me.


154
00:22:25.768 --> 00:22:29.036
Course we want to sell them.

155
00:22:31.174 --> 00:22:32.973
Yeah, check. Do that.

156
00:22:32.975 --> 00:22:34.742
Call me back.

157
00:22:36.545 --> 00:22:38.612
It's canceled?

158
00:22:38.614 --> 00:22:41.115
Bloody idiots,
they've screwed up somewhere.


159
00:22:41.117 --> 00:22:43.184
Harry would never
have done that.


160
00:22:43.186 --> 00:22:45.252
Maybe he did.

161
00:22:45.254 --> 00:22:47.188
Don't be so stupid.

162
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.089
I'm not stupid.

163
00:22:50.192 --> 00:22:51.625
What?
What are you on about?


164
00:22:51.627 --> 00:22:52.760
Stop calling me stupid.

165
00:22:52.762 --> 00:22:54.361
I've got 4 "a" levels,

166
00:22:54.363 --> 00:22:56.464
and I'm about to be
fully qualified as a vet.


167
00:22:56.466 --> 00:22:58.399
I'm not bloody stupid.

168
00:23:02.405 --> 00:23:04.405
So are we leaving
the stock up here,


169
00:23:04.407 --> 00:23:07.074
or are we taking 'em
out to the field?


170
00:23:07.076 --> 00:23:08.142
It's your farm.

171
00:23:17.085 --> 00:23:19.053
Bloody marvelous.

172
00:23:19.055 --> 00:23:20.888
Oh.

173
00:23:23.225 --> 00:23:25.359
You all came. Bloody marvelous.

174
00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:27.094
You want some digging done?

175
00:23:27.096 --> 00:23:28.629
Damn right.

176
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:30.898
Uh, you know what you're doing,
where you're going?


177
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.266
Afraid the bloody digger's
buggered.


178
00:23:32.268 --> 00:23:33.567
We brought spades.

179
00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:36.170
Good man.
Let me take you up there.


180
00:23:37.138 --> 00:23:38.506
Uh, sort this, will you?

181
00:23:38.508 --> 00:23:40.975
I'll walk the boys up
to the site.


182
00:23:46.448 --> 00:23:48.482
Hello.

183
00:23:48.484 --> 00:23:51.018
Are you, uh...
Are you Mrs. Catto?


184
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.522
Uh, clover.
What's going on?


185
00:23:54.524 --> 00:23:57.224
We've released
the licensed weapons.


186
00:23:57.226 --> 00:23:58.492
I've got 'em here,

187
00:23:58.494 --> 00:24:00.461
as well as Harry's clothes
and things.


188
00:24:00.463 --> 00:24:02.162
What weapons?

189
00:24:02.164 --> 00:24:03.464
There's shotguns.

190
00:24:03.466 --> 00:24:05.633
We had to take 'em away
on the night,


191
00:24:05.635 --> 00:24:07.935
but we've, uh...
We've released 'em now.


192
00:24:07.937 --> 00:24:11.238
You need to lock them up.

193
00:24:36.665 --> 00:24:39.233
This was round his neck.

194
00:24:39.235 --> 00:24:41.235
Don't know if you...

195
00:24:45.774 --> 00:24:49.209
Do you have a day
for the funeral yet?


196
00:24:49.211 --> 00:24:51.078
Not yet.

197
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.380
You're not
waiting for us, are you?


198
00:24:53.382 --> 00:24:56.584
Well, um...

199
00:24:56.586 --> 00:24:58.285
There will be an inquest,

200
00:24:58.287 --> 00:24:59.753
as with all suicides, but...

201
00:24:59.755 --> 00:25:01.755
There won't be
any further investigation,


202
00:25:01.757 --> 00:25:03.724
if that's what
you're worried about.


203
00:25:03.726 --> 00:25:06.260
So you're ruling it a suicide,

204
00:25:06.262 --> 00:25:07.928
not an accident?

205
00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:13.334
I... i mean,
it's not official yet, but...


206
00:26:26.608 --> 00:26:28.542
Steady.
Stop laughing, as well.


207
00:26:28.544 --> 00:26:31.478
Oh, fuck.

208
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.180
How does it feel?

209
00:26:33.182 --> 00:26:36.483
Like tiny butterflies
kissing my wrist.


210
00:26:36.485 --> 00:26:38.485
Fuck.

211
00:26:38.487 --> 00:26:40.988
So we never forget. Yeah.

212
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.223
Only moving 200 cattle
off our land


213
00:26:43.225 --> 00:26:46.493
in four foot of water
at 2:00 in the morning.


214
00:26:46.495 --> 00:26:48.562
Then, fuck, for you, man.

215
00:26:50.398 --> 00:26:51.465
Your tur...

216
00:27:03.045 --> 00:27:04.545
Steady.

217
00:27:04.547 --> 00:27:06.547
Stop laughing as well.

218
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:09.049
Oh, fuck.

219
00:27:19.661 --> 00:27:21.562
So were you at the party, then?

220
00:27:21.564 --> 00:27:22.930
Yep.

221
00:27:22.932 --> 00:27:25.499
Is that
where you got the shiner?


222
00:27:39.147 --> 00:27:42.116
Was Harry happy
about getting the farm?


223
00:27:42.118 --> 00:27:44.618
Was a pretty big deal
for him, wasn't it?


224
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:45.753
Yeah, of course.

225
00:27:45.755 --> 00:27:47.621
I mean, finally Aubrey
trusted him.


226
00:27:47.623 --> 00:27:50.691
He's not the easiest dad
in the world.


227
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.560
Harry was really chuffed.

228
00:27:55.463 --> 00:27:58.432
I think maybe Aubrey was
still trying to run the farm,


229
00:27:58.434 --> 00:28:01.401
with the sale and everything,
like he didn't trust Harry?


230
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.905
Is that why he canceled
the sale, do you think?


231
00:28:04.907 --> 00:28:06.373
He had other plans?

232
00:28:09.177 --> 00:28:10.511
- What's that?
- I don't know.


233
00:28:10.513 --> 00:28:13.514
Think we should just
smooth around and carry on.


234
00:28:13.516 --> 00:28:14.581
Hang on.

235
00:28:24.192 --> 00:28:26.693
Is that a badger?
Jesus Christ.


236
00:28:30.498 --> 00:28:31.965
There are more.

237
00:28:31.967 --> 00:28:34.201
Can you tell
what happened to them?


238
00:28:34.203 --> 00:28:36.737
They've been shot.
For fuck's sake.


239
00:28:38.174 --> 00:28:39.640
No, Milo!
Oh, can you get him away?


240
00:28:39.642 --> 00:28:41.742
Could you just go
lock him up somewhere?


241
00:28:41.744 --> 00:28:43.110
Where are you going?

242
00:28:43.112 --> 00:28:44.745
You're not going to call
the police, are you?


243
00:28:44.747 --> 00:28:46.213
Fucking Aubrey. Fuck!

244
00:28:47.983 --> 00:28:49.750
Ok. Very well.

245
00:28:49.752 --> 00:28:51.585
Bye.

246
00:29:00.963 --> 00:29:02.529
Where are you going?

247
00:29:02.531 --> 00:29:04.565
Roger needs some more
paperwork for this damn sale.


248
00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:06.533
They think you're
hiding something, do they?


249
00:29:06.535 --> 00:29:08.168
Oh, don't be
so bloody ridiculous.


250
00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.771
I just found dead
badgers buried out the back.


251
00:29:10.773 --> 00:29:11.772
What? Where?

252
00:29:11.774 --> 00:29:13.907
Shot dead.

253
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:15.275
Killing badgers

254
00:29:15.277 --> 00:29:17.311
is the fastest bloody way
to get thrown in clink.


255
00:29:17.313 --> 00:29:18.879
- I'm not that stupid.
- Ok, fine.


256
00:29:18.881 --> 00:29:20.547
You know best.

257
00:29:22.517 --> 00:29:25.219
I didn't have the keys
to the gun cupboard.


258
00:29:25.221 --> 00:29:27.821
I gave them to Harry
about 6 months ago.


259
00:29:27.823 --> 00:29:29.189
Harry?

260
00:29:29.191 --> 00:29:31.825
Well, he wouldn't.
He's not stupid. He...


261
00:29:31.827 --> 00:29:33.026
He isn't that stupid.

262
00:29:33.028 --> 00:29:35.095
Frankly, the only stupid thing

263
00:29:35.097 --> 00:29:36.463
he's done is burying them.

264
00:29:36.465 --> 00:29:38.599
He should have burned
the bloody things.


265
00:29:38.601 --> 00:29:40.934
If they'd had t.B.,
we'd be buggered!


266
00:30:00.221 --> 00:30:02.856
The police say it was suicide.

267
00:30:03.892 --> 00:30:05.559
Accidental death.

268
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.399
You don't accidentally
put a gun in your mouth.


269
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:14.268
You weren't here.

270
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:15.969
James was, and he agrees.

271
00:30:17.538 --> 00:30:19.740
But he didn't mean
to shoot himself.


272
00:30:19.742 --> 00:30:22.876
I'd just given him the farm,
for god's sake.


273
00:30:25.747 --> 00:30:27.314
Did he say anything to you?

274
00:30:27.316 --> 00:30:29.950
About what, the bloody badgers?

275
00:30:29.952 --> 00:30:30.951
He was a grown-up.

276
00:30:30.953 --> 00:30:32.352
Before he shot himself.

277
00:30:32.354 --> 00:30:35.389
He was drunk!

278
00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:51.672
Heh.

279
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.011
Your first letter
from boarding school.


280
00:30:59.548 --> 00:31:02.149
You wrote it to Sandy,
because you were cross with me.


281
00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:04.284
Sandy?
The dog Sandy?


282
00:31:04.286 --> 00:31:06.653
The one you shot.

283
00:31:06.655 --> 00:31:10.057
"Please tell daddy that
I have to eat corned beef here,


284
00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:11.558
"and it's not beef at all.

285
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.860
"It's bloody freezing here,

286
00:31:13.862 --> 00:31:16.797
and my socks
all have holes in them."


287
00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:18.598
Heh.

288
00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:27.274
I hated boarding school.

289
00:31:27.276 --> 00:31:28.275
No, you didn't.

290
00:31:28.277 --> 00:31:30.777
Harry hated boarding school.

291
00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:32.646
He never went.
He got to stay here.


292
00:31:32.648 --> 00:31:34.982
He did.
He went for a term...


293
00:31:35.984 --> 00:31:37.884
Cried the whole time.

294
00:31:37.886 --> 00:31:42.756
Came back home to the farmyard
happy as a pig in shit.


295
00:31:44.092 --> 00:31:46.026
You loved it there.

296
00:31:46.028 --> 00:31:48.462
"Give mummy a big lick from me,

297
00:31:48.464 --> 00:31:50.564
and tell her
I'll be home soon."


298
00:31:53.034 --> 00:31:55.902
The riding, too.
You were pony mad.


299
00:31:55.904 --> 00:31:58.038
Kept me busy, didn't it?

300
00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.106
Hmm?

301
00:32:02.143 --> 00:32:03.977
Nothing.

302
00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.824
When did you leave the army?

303
00:32:19.727 --> 00:32:22.696
Uh, my father got ill.

304
00:32:23.531 --> 00:32:25.632
My mother was dead.

305
00:32:25.634 --> 00:32:27.501
Your mother
wanted to have children,


306
00:32:27.503 --> 00:32:29.803
so we came back to the farm.

307
00:32:29.805 --> 00:32:31.304
They're good places
for children, farms.


308
00:32:31.306 --> 00:32:33.473
What about you?
Didn't you want children?


309
00:32:33.475 --> 00:32:35.042
Of course I did.

310
00:32:37.812 --> 00:32:39.913
Only if they were like you.

311
00:32:39.915 --> 00:32:42.616
Well, I got that,
didn't I? Bloody hell.


312
00:32:44.752 --> 00:32:46.887
I never knew
what made my mother so angry


313
00:32:46.889 --> 00:32:50.223
until I heard you
telling me how to run my farm.


314
00:32:50.225 --> 00:32:52.292
Heh. You were impossible.

315
00:32:53.227 --> 00:32:55.662
Never met such a born farmer.

316
00:32:57.565 --> 00:33:00.133
So you gave the farm to Harry?

317
00:33:00.135 --> 00:33:01.601
You left.

318
00:33:06.474 --> 00:33:08.775
You told me to go.

319
00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:10.677
No, I didn't.

320
00:33:10.679 --> 00:33:12.712
Yeah, you did. I was 18.

321
00:33:12.714 --> 00:33:15.415
You told me to get
the hell out of here,


322
00:33:15.417 --> 00:33:18.218
and then nothing. Heh.

323
00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.486
No phone call. No apology.

324
00:33:19.488 --> 00:33:21.288
You were being
bloody impossible.


325
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.422
I was 18.

326
00:33:22.424 --> 00:33:23.790
Exactly.

327
00:33:23.792 --> 00:33:25.892
You weren't in charge.
It was my farm.


328
00:33:25.894 --> 00:33:27.294
You expected my respect?

329
00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:29.096
Yes, I bloody
expected your respect.


330
00:33:29.098 --> 00:33:31.098
- I was your father.
- You were the man


331
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.234
who left me at boarding school
when my mother died.


332
00:33:35.203 --> 00:33:36.903
Didn't bring me home
for her funeral.


333
00:33:36.905 --> 00:33:38.738
What's that got to do with it?

334
00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.340
That was years before.

335
00:33:40.342 --> 00:33:42.142
So it didn't matter?

336
00:33:43.978 --> 00:33:46.913
Was it better
to forget about it?


337
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.417
My mother?

338
00:33:50.419 --> 00:33:52.419
Yes, clover, yes.

339
00:33:53.754 --> 00:33:56.389
That's how it works.

340
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:59.893
You have to forget about it
and then move on.


341
00:33:59.895 --> 00:34:02.129
And change the subject
every time she's mentioned?


342
00:34:02.131 --> 00:34:05.365
You have to get up,
get out of bed,


343
00:34:05.367 --> 00:34:08.068
and milk the bloody cows.

344
00:34:27.288 --> 00:34:30.056
You sure this thing's up here?

345
00:34:33.394 --> 00:34:36.163
I shouldn't think so
for a minute.


346
00:34:39.433 --> 00:34:41.101
Should we go, then?

347
00:35:05.526 --> 00:35:06.526
Hi. Mr. Jones?

348
00:35:06.528 --> 00:35:08.495
It's clover.

349
00:35:08.497 --> 00:35:10.931
Hi. Uh...

350
00:35:10.933 --> 00:35:12.532
I'm ok. Uh, it's fine.

351
00:35:12.534 --> 00:35:14.134
Um, I just, uh...

352
00:35:15.303 --> 00:35:18.104
I've just found
some badgers on the farm.


353
00:35:18.773 --> 00:35:21.641
Dead ones, shot.

354
00:35:21.643 --> 00:35:25.512
Um, I just wondered if...

355
00:35:25.514 --> 00:35:26.880
I know. I know. I just, um...

356
00:35:26.882 --> 00:35:28.915
I need them off the farm. I...

357
00:35:28.917 --> 00:35:31.551
Could you ask animal health
if they...


358
00:35:31.553 --> 00:35:33.520
No, no... not the police.

359
00:35:33.522 --> 00:35:35.288
Um, please.

360
00:35:36.557 --> 00:35:38.525
You'll be my best friend.

361
00:35:41.295 --> 00:35:43.396
Thank you.

362
00:35:43.398 --> 00:35:44.965
Thanks.

363
00:37:24.832 --> 00:37:25.832
Right.

364
00:39:40.034 --> 00:39:41.768
Clover.

365
00:39:45.039 --> 00:39:46.940
It's me, Helen.

366
00:39:46.942 --> 00:39:48.107
Helen.

367
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:49.876
How are you doing?

368
00:39:51.178 --> 00:39:53.379
I'm so sorry, my love.

369
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:55.348
How are you?

370
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:56.716
Did you do all this?

371
00:39:56.718 --> 00:39:59.352
Oh, well, it was a big occasion,

372
00:39:59.354 --> 00:40:01.855
Harry finally getting the farm.

373
00:40:01.857 --> 00:40:05.592
Lovely for everyone, really,
after the year we've had.


374
00:40:07.461 --> 00:40:08.862
Were you here?

375
00:40:08.864 --> 00:40:10.430
No.

376
00:40:10.432 --> 00:40:13.099
No, I'd gone to bed by then.

377
00:40:13.101 --> 00:40:14.667
Bit late for me.

378
00:40:16.103 --> 00:40:18.171
This is for you and your dad.

379
00:40:19.139 --> 00:40:21.140
Shepherd's pie.

380
00:40:21.142 --> 00:40:22.642
Stew. Easy stuff.

381
00:40:22.644 --> 00:40:24.611
Don't worry
about the Tupperware.


382
00:40:24.613 --> 00:40:26.279
I'll get that back whenever.

383
00:40:26.281 --> 00:40:27.281
Ok.

384
00:40:28.517 --> 00:40:31.150
Do you need
anything else, my love?


385
00:40:31.152 --> 00:40:32.986
I'm all set.

386
00:40:36.824 --> 00:40:38.091
Helen.

387
00:40:41.161 --> 00:40:43.129
Thanks for calling me.

388
00:40:44.198 --> 00:40:46.466
Aubrey wouldn't have thought to.

389
00:40:46.468 --> 00:40:48.568
He asked me to ring you.

390
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.137
You're never far
from his thoughts.


391
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.777
Thank you.

392
00:41:00.214 --> 00:41:01.848
Look who I found.

393
00:41:05.219 --> 00:41:07.220
- Hi.
- Hi.


394
00:41:07.222 --> 00:41:08.988
I thought
he could do with some grub.


395
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.690
Been working
like a packhorse out there.


396
00:41:10.692 --> 00:41:11.958
I just need the loo.

397
00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.961
Oh. Light a match,
will you?


398
00:41:16.564 --> 00:41:18.565
I saw Helen.
She gave us some food.


399
00:41:18.567 --> 00:41:20.433
Did she? Oh, good.

400
00:41:20.435 --> 00:41:21.968
I'm starving. What have we got?

401
00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:24.504
Um, Shepherd's pie
and stuff, I think.


402
00:41:24.506 --> 00:41:26.272
Ah. Want a drink?

403
00:41:28.276 --> 00:41:29.342
Want a drink, James?

404
00:41:29.344 --> 00:41:30.710
It's a bit early for me.

405
00:41:30.712 --> 00:41:32.278
Oh, come on.
We've got, um...


406
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.279
Shepherd's pie.

407
00:41:33.281 --> 00:41:34.581
Shepherd's pie.

408
00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:38.284
Oh, come on, Harry.
Don't be such a girl.


409
00:41:42.289 --> 00:41:43.790
You be mum.

410
00:41:46.293 --> 00:41:47.894
Mmm.

411
00:41:51.398 --> 00:41:53.566
Where's yours?

412
00:41:53.568 --> 00:41:55.068
I don't eat meat, Aubrey.

413
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.370
This isn't meat.
This is Shepherd's pie.


414
00:41:58.973 --> 00:42:01.007
You can just eat the potato.

415
00:42:01.009 --> 00:42:03.643
There you go.
Just eat the potato.


416
00:42:03.645 --> 00:42:06.179
It's cooked
with the meat, though, isn't it?


417
00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:13.152
Vegetables scream.
Do you know that?


418
00:42:13.154 --> 00:42:17.357
They do. They scream blue murder
when they're being chopped down.


419
00:42:17.359 --> 00:42:18.658
That's not true.

420
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.360
Bloody is.

421
00:42:20.362 --> 00:42:21.594
You know that, don't you?

422
00:42:21.596 --> 00:42:23.129
I heard they swear, too.

423
00:42:23.131 --> 00:42:25.698
- In French.
- Oh, mon dieu.


424
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.367
That's what leeks say.

425
00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:30.136
"Mm.

426
00:42:30.138 --> 00:42:31.070
Oh, my roots."

427
00:42:31.072 --> 00:42:32.872
Ha ha ha. Like some cheap whore.

428
00:42:32.874 --> 00:42:35.642
Oh, look out. There you go.

429
00:42:35.644 --> 00:42:37.410
She's eaten some.
Call the papers.


430
00:42:37.412 --> 00:42:39.412
It's just potato.

431
00:42:39.414 --> 00:42:40.413
Heh.

432
00:42:40.415 --> 00:42:42.115
Look at that smile.

433
00:42:43.384 --> 00:42:45.485
One in a million.

434
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:05.138
Did you know
Harry killed the badgers?


435
00:43:07.207 --> 00:43:08.708
Yes.

436
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:09.909
How?

437
00:43:09.911 --> 00:43:12.845
Did he tell you?
Did you catch him?


438
00:43:13.847 --> 00:43:16.182
I helped him shoot them.

439
00:43:16.184 --> 00:43:17.450
Why?

440
00:43:18.619 --> 00:43:20.253
He asked.

441
00:43:23.557 --> 00:43:25.525
Are you gonna tell the police?

442
00:43:37.337 --> 00:43:39.706
What happened at the party,
James?


443
00:43:39.708 --> 00:43:42.308
How did he end up
in that bathroom?


444
00:43:43.477 --> 00:43:47.613
Why did you never
come home after the floods?


445
00:43:47.615 --> 00:43:49.816
Well, we talked about it,

446
00:43:49.818 --> 00:43:51.918
but Harry told me not to.

447
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.121
He said he was fine,
he could manage.


448
00:43:56.757 --> 00:43:58.357
He knew he could ask me anytime.

449
00:43:58.359 --> 00:44:00.293
You know they're broke,
don't you?


450
00:44:00.295 --> 00:44:02.929
The house is a wreck.
Their insurance fucked up.


451
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:04.897
The land is still full of glass

452
00:44:04.899 --> 00:44:06.999
and all kinds of shit
from the floods.


453
00:44:07.001 --> 00:44:08.568
What about all of you, then?

454
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.337
How are they paying all of you?
They can't be that broke.


455
00:44:11.339 --> 00:44:14.373
No one's paying us.
No one's paid us for months.


456
00:44:17.244 --> 00:44:19.178
Well, it'll be fine.
We're selling stock.


457
00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.981
Perfect, so you can
sweep in and take over now.


458
00:44:21.983 --> 00:44:23.616
You get everything
you always wanted.


459
00:44:23.618 --> 00:44:25.051
What?

460
00:44:28.622 --> 00:44:29.856
Did Harry say that?

461
00:44:29.858 --> 00:44:31.691
I gotta go.

462
00:44:45.739 --> 00:44:49.142
So shall we start
by choosing the readings?


463
00:44:49.144 --> 00:44:50.676
Shall I get my Bible?

464
00:44:50.678 --> 00:44:52.044
No, I came prepared.

465
00:44:52.046 --> 00:44:55.748
Clover, would you like
to do a reading?


466
00:44:57.017 --> 00:44:58.484
Sure. Fine.

467
00:44:58.486 --> 00:45:02.488
Is there anything
particular you want to express?


468
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:07.627
Any part of Harry's life
you want to honor or...


469
00:45:07.629 --> 00:45:10.730
Anything that
you're struggling with?


470
00:45:10.732 --> 00:45:12.765
Not sure. Heh.

471
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.104
Um...

472
00:45:22.376 --> 00:45:25.211
Don't know what I want to say.

473
00:45:25.213 --> 00:45:29.315
What would you have said
about him last week?


474
00:45:29.317 --> 00:45:32.385
Last week, he wasn't dead,

475
00:45:32.387 --> 00:45:34.554
and I can't unknown
these things about him.


476
00:45:34.556 --> 00:45:37.690
That's the person
you're going to miss, isn't it,


477
00:45:37.692 --> 00:45:39.559
the one from last week?

478
00:45:39.561 --> 00:45:41.828
But that person's gone.

479
00:45:44.565 --> 00:45:47.800
And I don't know
if he ever really existed.


480
00:45:49.636 --> 00:45:53.005
That person
would never have done this...


481
00:45:53.007 --> 00:45:55.308
Would never have killed himself.

482
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.612
When people
commit suicide unexpectedly,


483
00:45:59.614 --> 00:46:03.549
it's natural to want
to make sense of their actions,


484
00:46:03.551 --> 00:46:07.720
but you're also trying to work
out your place in that story,


485
00:46:07.722 --> 00:46:12.325
so maybe what
you're struggling with


486
00:46:12.327 --> 00:46:16.596
is... is about you, not him.

487
00:46:17.798 --> 00:46:22.869
Guilt is incredibly common
for survivors of suicides.


488
00:46:22.871 --> 00:46:24.871
I'm not feeling guilt.

489
00:46:29.176 --> 00:46:30.877
I wasn't even here.

490
00:47:09.884 --> 00:47:11.651
Come, Milo!

491
00:47:13.887 --> 00:47:15.021
Milo, come!

492
00:47:16.056 --> 00:47:17.590
Come on.

493
00:47:18.959 --> 00:47:19.959
Good boy.

494
00:47:36.977 --> 00:47:38.511
Milo?

495
00:49:14.875 --> 00:49:17.209
Ah, god.

496
00:49:17.211 --> 00:49:19.245
Oh, shit.

497
00:49:54.281 --> 00:49:55.981
Aubrey.

498
00:51:54.668 --> 00:51:57.570
Hi. I've got lunch.

499
00:52:01.107 --> 00:52:02.841
What was that petrol
doing in the kitchen?


500
00:52:02.843 --> 00:52:03.943
The place stinks.

501
00:52:03.945 --> 00:52:06.612
What? What petrol?

502
00:52:07.781 --> 00:52:09.515
Did you have to run a generator

503
00:52:09.517 --> 00:52:10.649
in there or something?

504
00:52:18.858 --> 00:52:20.593
How is the river?

505
00:52:23.563 --> 00:52:25.197
Wet.

506
00:52:28.001 --> 00:52:30.269
We need to talk
about the funeral.


507
00:52:33.607 --> 00:52:35.407
About what?

508
00:52:35.409 --> 00:52:37.943
Are we gonna have people
here afterwards?


509
00:52:37.945 --> 00:52:40.145
Shall I talk to Helen about it?

510
00:52:40.147 --> 00:52:42.615
Larry's offered the king's arms.

511
00:52:42.617 --> 00:52:44.383
Can do it all there.

512
00:52:48.855 --> 00:52:52.358
And after that, what
are you gonna do on the farm?


513
00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.260
You ok to look after it
by yourself?


514
00:52:54.262 --> 00:52:59.365
Because I should get back
to college, really, but...


515
00:52:59.367 --> 00:53:01.166
about to release that vehicle.

516
00:53:01.168 --> 00:53:02.901
30 seconds are holding him back.

517
00:53:04.639 --> 00:53:06.205
Aubrey.

518
00:53:09.009 --> 00:53:11.043
Just go.

519
00:53:11.045 --> 00:53:12.778
You always did what you wanted.

520
00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:14.580
No reason to stop now.

521
00:53:16.683 --> 00:53:18.917
What?

522
00:53:18.919 --> 00:53:21.587
You're not cut out for this.

523
00:53:24.692 --> 00:53:26.358
Fine.

524
00:53:29.897 --> 00:53:31.096
Hi.

525
00:53:31.098 --> 00:53:33.699
Um, we were just working
around the back,


526
00:53:33.701 --> 00:53:35.334
and there's a new calf there.

527
00:53:35.336 --> 00:53:37.670
- Where?
- In the barn.


528
00:53:37.672 --> 00:53:39.438
Oh, bloody hell.

529
00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.709
Ah, stupid bloody animals.

530
00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:44.810
She'll be fine.

531
00:53:49.215 --> 00:53:51.750
Ah, well done, girl.

532
00:53:51.752 --> 00:53:53.585
Good job.

533
00:53:53.587 --> 00:53:55.354
Bloody good job.

534
00:53:56.756 --> 00:53:58.223
Seems healthy.

535
00:53:59.225 --> 00:54:00.826
He's breathing well. Yep.

536
00:54:00.828 --> 00:54:01.828
Excellent.

537
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:05.764
It's a boy.

538
00:54:07.234 --> 00:54:09.568
What do you want to do,
send it to market?


539
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:14.006
Ah, no use for it here,
and Hatfield won't want it.


540
00:54:14.008 --> 00:54:15.040
Best to cull it.

541
00:54:15.042 --> 00:54:17.810
Now?

542
00:54:17.812 --> 00:54:19.812
You're the vet.

543
00:54:19.814 --> 00:54:21.613
You want me to shoot it?

544
00:54:21.615 --> 00:54:23.415
Guns are
in the cupboard, aren't they?


545
00:54:23.417 --> 00:54:25.617
Can't we give it a day
for them to be together?


546
00:54:25.619 --> 00:54:27.820
She's gonna be full of hormones
and colostrum.


547
00:54:27.822 --> 00:54:29.088
We need that out of her.

548
00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:31.023
Best done as soon as possible.

549
00:54:31.025 --> 00:54:32.558
Don't want them
getting attached.


550
00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.228
Or I could get
one of the boys to do it.


551
00:56:59.539 --> 00:57:01.406
Hi. What's going on?

552
00:57:01.408 --> 00:57:03.208
Can I show you something?

553
00:57:04.377 --> 00:57:05.978
Yeah, sure.

554
00:57:21.427 --> 00:57:22.661
What?

555
00:57:22.663 --> 00:57:24.196
Where are you going?

556
00:57:24.198 --> 00:57:27.099
I just want
to show you something in here.


557
00:57:27.101 --> 00:57:28.166
Uh, look...

558
00:57:31.004 --> 00:57:32.271
What, James?

559
00:57:32.273 --> 00:57:34.206
What's wrong?

560
00:57:34.208 --> 00:57:36.041
Not that way.

561
00:57:36.043 --> 00:57:38.210
No? Why not?

562
00:57:38.212 --> 00:57:39.344
Not with that torch.

563
00:57:39.346 --> 00:57:42.214
Why not, James?
Tell me.


564
00:57:45.385 --> 00:57:46.952
Ok!

565
00:57:49.222 --> 00:57:51.089
Let's just go.

566
00:57:59.666 --> 00:58:01.300
So everyone was here.

567
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:06.805
Aubrey made
this big speech about...


568
00:58:07.574 --> 00:58:10.475
Passing it on to Harry,

569
00:58:10.477 --> 00:58:13.345
future of farming
being in our hands.


570
00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:17.015
Then we got drunk...

571
00:58:18.284 --> 00:58:20.185
Really drunk.

572
00:58:20.187 --> 00:58:22.754
We were fire-walking
in the back field.


573
00:58:22.756 --> 00:58:25.724
Matilda's lot
had laid out the coals.


574
00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:30.329
It was all fun and games
till Harry did it.


575
00:58:32.298 --> 00:58:34.099
He wouldn't get off.

576
00:58:34.101 --> 00:58:37.302
He was just standing
on the coals,


577
00:58:37.304 --> 00:58:39.371
beating his chest, and roaring.

578
00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.140
Everyone was cheering him on.

579
00:58:43.409 --> 00:58:46.378
I was scared, you know?

580
00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.147
His feet, they were burning.

581
00:58:49.149 --> 00:58:51.850
So I pulled him off,
and he punched me.


582
00:58:53.252 --> 00:58:55.654
Which was fucking
out of order, you know?


583
00:58:55.656 --> 00:58:57.155
So I tell him to fuck off,

584
00:58:57.157 --> 00:59:01.360
and he turns to me, and he says,
"let's have a drink."


585
00:59:02.629 --> 00:59:06.365
He chases me
through the courtyard. He's...


586
00:59:07.367 --> 00:59:11.203
Screaming like superman.

587
00:59:12.472 --> 00:59:17.409
We come in here, and he makes us
drink something foul.


588
00:59:19.212 --> 00:59:22.414
And he says he's got
something to show me,


589
00:59:22.416 --> 00:59:24.416
his new plan,

590
00:59:24.418 --> 00:59:26.652
his new new plan. Heh.

591
00:59:26.654 --> 00:59:29.221
We've had a few plans already.

592
00:59:29.223 --> 00:59:33.825
So I'm a bit fucking fed up
with his plans, but you know...


593
00:59:35.428 --> 00:59:36.962
It's Harry.

594
00:59:38.431 --> 00:59:39.998
He's my best friend.

595
00:59:43.836 --> 00:59:45.937
So I take a look...

596
00:59:47.473 --> 00:59:49.274
In the kitchen.

597
00:59:49.276 --> 00:59:51.076
He's got this gleam in his eye,

598
00:59:51.078 --> 00:59:54.012
like, "this is it.
This is everything."


599
00:59:57.050 --> 01:00:00.018
He wants to burn the house down.

600
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.821
He says, "if we do it tonight,
we can say we didn't know,


601
01:00:02.823 --> 01:00:04.456
"and it might have been
the party, and...


602
01:00:04.458 --> 01:00:06.858
"We'll get the insurance
from the house,


603
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.861
and all the money problems
will be over."


604
01:00:13.499 --> 01:00:16.068
He was out of his fucking mind.

605
01:00:17.403 --> 01:00:18.737
Told him no way.

606
01:00:18.739 --> 01:00:21.440
I told him it'd never work
and he'd get locked up.


607
01:00:21.442 --> 01:00:23.809
Told him we probably
should get locked up,


608
01:00:23.811 --> 01:00:26.611
and he grabbed my face,
and he spat at me.


609
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:34.553
I took the matches from him,
and I told him that was it,


610
01:00:34.555 --> 01:00:36.254
he was on his own.

611
01:00:38.791 --> 01:00:41.893
He yelled something at me.

612
01:00:41.895 --> 01:00:44.096
I can't remember now.

613
01:00:55.575 --> 01:00:57.609
And then what?

614
01:00:57.611 --> 01:00:59.111
I don't know.

615
01:00:59.912 --> 01:01:01.613
I saw him talking to Aubrey,

616
01:01:01.615 --> 01:01:02.748
and then he disappeared.

617
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.483
To Aubrey?

618
01:01:05.718 --> 01:01:07.619
What was he talking about?

619
01:01:07.621 --> 01:01:09.254
I couldn't hear.

620
01:01:09.256 --> 01:01:12.124
Aubrey was giving him
an earful as usual.


621
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:19.364
Then I heard a bang.

622
01:01:26.706 --> 01:01:28.440
You found him?

623
01:01:41.254 --> 01:01:44.389
So Aubrey was the last person
to talk to him.


624
01:01:56.936 --> 01:01:59.504
Wasn't your fault, James.

625
01:02:01.741 --> 01:02:03.241
What?

626
01:02:05.244 --> 01:02:07.579
Don't blame yourself.

627
01:02:17.757 --> 01:02:19.357
Fuck you.

628
01:02:26.098 --> 01:02:28.533
That would be marvelous.

629
01:02:28.535 --> 01:02:29.734
Thank you.

630
01:02:29.736 --> 01:02:32.304
Yes. Uh...

631
01:02:32.306 --> 01:02:36.408
11:00 Friday, all saints church.

632
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:37.809
Yeah.

633
01:02:37.811 --> 01:02:39.678
Thank you, Bridget.

634
01:02:41.347 --> 01:02:43.915
James says you were
talking to Harry at the party.


635
01:02:43.917 --> 01:02:45.917
What?

636
01:02:45.919 --> 01:02:47.452
Before he shot himself.

637
01:02:48.387 --> 01:02:50.055
James says you were
talking to Harry,


638
01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:52.290
and then he shot himself.

639
01:02:53.826 --> 01:02:54.893
What did you say?

640
01:02:54.895 --> 01:02:57.696
For god's sake, clover.

641
01:02:57.698 --> 01:03:00.165
We were talking all night.
It was a party.


642
01:03:00.167 --> 01:03:02.234
So you can't remember
the last thing


643
01:03:02.236 --> 01:03:04.903
you said to your son
before he killed himself?


644
01:03:12.245 --> 01:03:14.913
I don't want this
to be your fault!


645
01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:25.523
We are not just gonna sit here

646
01:03:25.525 --> 01:03:28.393
and pretend
that this didn't happen,


647
01:03:28.395 --> 01:03:32.330
that it's ok not to talk
about it, not again.


648
01:03:40.306 --> 01:03:42.440
Or maybe you can just
put your family in the ground


649
01:03:42.442 --> 01:03:44.776
one by one and not give a shit.

650
01:03:44.778 --> 01:03:45.944
Get out.

651
01:03:45.946 --> 01:03:48.046
Get out now!

652
01:03:48.048 --> 01:03:49.714
Get the hell out!

653
01:07:20.459 --> 01:07:22.360
Hello.
Can I help you?


654
01:07:22.362 --> 01:07:23.495
Hello, my love. 
Animal health,

655
01:07:23.497 --> 01:07:25.730
here to collect the animals.

656
01:07:25.732 --> 01:07:27.198
Oh!
I can just take you to them.


657
01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.702
Got all the details here,
list of all the reactives.


658
01:07:30.704 --> 01:07:32.403
What?

659
01:07:32.405 --> 01:07:35.073
Oh, the infected cattle,
the one's we're collecting.


660
01:07:35.075 --> 01:07:37.809
- The cattle?
- Yes, my love.


661
01:07:37.811 --> 01:07:39.677
I thought you were here
for the badgers.


662
01:07:39.679 --> 01:07:42.180
Badgers? What badgers?

663
01:07:48.654 --> 01:07:50.054
They have t.B.?

664
01:07:50.056 --> 01:07:52.490
Is there someone
in charge around here?


665
01:08:12.478 --> 01:08:13.845
What happened?

666
01:08:14.847 --> 01:08:16.748
Apparently they sent the results

667
01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:18.483
last week to Harry.

668
01:08:18.485 --> 01:08:21.152
See why he canceled the sale.

669
01:08:21.154 --> 01:08:22.921
Why didn't he tell you?

670
01:08:27.493 --> 01:08:28.793
I better call Roger,

671
01:08:28.795 --> 01:08:31.262
tell him it's all over.

672
01:09:22.615 --> 01:09:24.082
Aubrey.

673
01:09:32.458 --> 01:09:33.658
Aubrey?

674
01:09:34.627 --> 01:09:35.994
- Milo.

675
01:09:35.996 --> 01:09:36.995
- Where's Aubrey, Milo?

676
01:09:36.997 --> 01:09:38.630
Where is he?

677
01:10:05.491 --> 01:10:06.758
Good boy, Milo.

678
01:10:32.551 --> 01:10:35.386
And you will pass
my number on to James?


679
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:39.257
It would just, uh...

680
01:10:40.392 --> 01:10:43.761
It would really just be great
just to talk to him


681
01:10:43.763 --> 01:10:45.363
before tomorrow.

682
01:10:46.198 --> 01:10:48.733
He is coming tomorrow, isn't he?

683
01:10:50.736 --> 01:10:52.603
Ok.

684
01:10:52.605 --> 01:10:53.805
Thanks, Sheila.

685
01:10:53.807 --> 01:10:55.807
Ok.

686
01:10:55.809 --> 01:10:57.675
Bye.

687
01:12:05.944 --> 01:12:08.246
Morning.

688
01:12:08.248 --> 01:12:11.382
Do you have a shirt
or anything you need ironed?


689
01:12:20.993 --> 01:12:23.027
Where have you been?

690
01:12:24.963 --> 01:12:26.664
I was just in bed.

691
01:12:27.966 --> 01:12:31.002
We needed you.

692
01:12:31.004 --> 01:12:32.804
We needed you here.

693
01:12:37.075 --> 01:12:38.876
I know.

694
01:12:42.114 --> 01:12:44.615
Why didn't you come?

695
01:12:50.022 --> 01:12:51.756
I'm sorry.

696
01:12:55.327 --> 01:12:57.495
I'm so sorry.

697
01:13:04.002 --> 01:13:04.003
He should have told me.

698
01:13:04.003 --> 01:13:07.472
He should have told me
he needed me. I asked him.


699
01:13:07.474 --> 01:13:09.106
You knew how soft he was.

700
01:13:09.108 --> 01:13:13.077
You knew he couldn't cope.
You don't wait for him to ask.


701
01:13:13.079 --> 01:13:14.445
I know.

702
01:13:14.447 --> 01:13:17.615
He shouldn't have to call you.

703
01:13:17.617 --> 01:13:22.086
He shouldn't have to ask me
to call you.


704
01:13:22.088 --> 01:13:25.056
For Christ's sake.

705
01:13:25.058 --> 01:13:26.057
What?

706
01:13:26.059 --> 01:13:27.792
I trusted him.

707
01:13:29.495 --> 01:13:32.497
I gave him the farm.
He promised me he could cope.


708
01:13:32.499 --> 01:13:33.698
What are you talking about?

709
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.567
He needs you to come home.

710
01:13:36.569 --> 01:13:39.270
What the hell
am I supposed to say?


711
01:13:39.272 --> 01:13:40.905
"Oh, yes, of course you can.

712
01:13:40.907 --> 01:13:45.209
You just go running to clover.
She'll get you out of it."


713
01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:46.711
No, I bloody didn't.

714
01:13:46.713 --> 01:13:49.714
"Don't you dare," I said.
"Don't you dare.


715
01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:52.517
"You knuckle down,
and you deal with it.


716
01:13:52.519 --> 01:13:55.820
"This is your farm now.
This is your life.


717
01:13:55.822 --> 01:14:00.224
You bloody better get on
with it, or what use are you?!"


718
01:14:04.963 --> 01:14:09.734
Wh-when did he
want to call me?


719
01:14:11.103 --> 01:14:12.703
During the party?

720
01:14:12.705 --> 01:14:17.842
It's a bloody
ridiculous time to call someone!


721
01:14:32.457 --> 01:14:34.225
I'll get that.

722
01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:38.131
Morning.

723
01:14:38.131 --> 01:14:40.565
Morning, love. You ready?

724
01:14:40.567 --> 01:14:42.433
Just getting ready now.

725
01:14:42.435 --> 01:14:43.568
How's Aubrey holding up?

726
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:44.936
He's fine.

727
01:14:44.938 --> 01:14:46.637
I don't know
what you have for clothes,


728
01:14:46.639 --> 01:14:48.272
but it's supposed to rain today,

729
01:14:48.274 --> 01:14:50.608
and I thought you might like
something smart for the church.


730
01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:52.109
Thank you.
That's so kind.


731
01:14:52.111 --> 01:14:54.912
And I just wanted you
to take a look at the flowers.


732
01:14:54.914 --> 01:14:58.082
We've all pitched in,
but I wanted you to be sure


733
01:14:58.084 --> 01:14:59.717
that they were
what he would have wanted.


734
01:14:59.719 --> 01:15:00.851
I-I'm sure
they're perfect.


735
01:15:00.853 --> 01:15:02.987
Will you come and have a look?

736
01:15:04.323 --> 01:15:06.324
Yeah, of course.

737
01:15:13.665 --> 01:15:15.299
They're lovely. Thanks, Helen.

738
01:15:15.301 --> 01:15:18.803
Are you sure? 'Cause
BRIONY put some yellow in hers,


739
01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:21.238
and I'm not sure
what you felt about yellow.


740
01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.541
I didn't want them
to look weddingy.


741
01:15:23.543 --> 01:15:24.976
Where are you going?

742
01:15:24.978 --> 01:15:27.545
Just gotta get
something from the house.


743
01:15:27.547 --> 01:15:29.580
Morning, Helen. 
Lovely flowers.

744
01:15:29.582 --> 01:15:31.682
Morning, Aubrey.

745
01:15:31.684 --> 01:15:33.684
You better get back.
Thank you, Helen.


746
01:15:33.686 --> 01:15:34.885
We'll be over in a minute.

747
01:15:34.887 --> 01:15:36.754
Lovely.
You go and get ready,


748
01:15:36.756 --> 01:15:38.990
and I'll see you there.

749
01:16:34.312 --> 01:16:35.479
Daddy!

750
01:16:59.538 --> 01:17:00.938
Daddy.

751
01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:03.974
Daddy!

752
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:06.711
Daddy!

753
01:17:22.728 --> 01:17:24.562
Daddy! No, daddy!

754
01:17:24.564 --> 01:17:25.696
Stop!

755
01:17:25.698 --> 01:17:27.198
S-s-stop!

756
01:17:29.468 --> 01:17:30.634
- Stop.

757
01:17:34.639 --> 01:17:36.273
Just stop.

758
01:17:38.811 --> 01:17:40.611
- No more. No more.

759
01:17:40.613 --> 01:17:41.779
It's over.

760
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:43.314
No.

761
01:17:44.883 --> 01:17:46.784
Stop. No more.

762
01:17:46.786 --> 01:17:47.786
Daddy, please.

763
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:54.391
Just go.

764
01:17:54.393 --> 01:17:55.626
Go! Go!

765
01:17:55.628 --> 01:17:56.927
Go live your life!

766
01:17:56.929 --> 01:17:58.629
I don't want to go.

767
01:18:03.502 --> 01:18:04.735
I...

768
01:18:06.805 --> 01:18:08.739
I want to stay here.

769
01:18:23.755 --> 01:18:25.756
You want me to go?

770
01:18:28.026 --> 01:18:30.694
There's nothing left
for you here.


771
01:18:36.735 --> 01:18:38.402
You're here.

772
01:18:40.839 --> 01:18:42.673
You're here.

773
01:18:51.983 --> 01:18:53.584
Give me the gun.
