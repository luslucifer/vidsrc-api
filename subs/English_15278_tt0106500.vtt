Now, fellas, this is kind of
the condensed rough cut, OK?


31
00:02:49.698 --> 00:02:51.608
It's very rough.

32
00:02:51.826 --> 00:02:56.075
I know you guys are pressed for time
with the big show, yippee, coming up.


33
00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:59.287
But what I need here is your input.

34
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.415
Shut the fuck up and start this shit!
My woman's waitin' for me.


35
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.170
- Yeah.
- OK, here we go. It's rough.

Don't be touchin' me, man, OK?

<i>They sold more records than Elvis

<i>They'll forever be known as

54

<i>Cell Block 4.</i>

55
00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:01.000
Yo, check this out. 
I'm hard-core.

56
00:05:02.422 --> 00:05:04.828
I had a lid on this game.
I had this sewed up, man.


57
00:05:05.048 --> 00:05:07.586
Then I heard these motherfuckers, CB4.

58
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:12.630
These motherfuckers is real, G.
They show me their guns, G.


59
00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.093
What the fuck I'm supposed
to do now, man? Can't dance.


60
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.888
Shit's fucked up.

61
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.153
But I met 'em. Gusto stepped to me.
He said, "Yo, Ice. You down with CB4."


62
00:05:25.362 --> 00:05:27.271
I was blessed, man.

63
00:05:27.488 --> 00:05:30.573
If I had to choose one,
I'm Gusto all the way.


64
00:05:30.783 --> 00:05:34.236
It's those gold teeth that...
Something, I don' know.


65
00:05:34.454 --> 00:05:36.577
Gusto. Is that it?

66
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.957
I saw Gusto one day.
We was at a park picnic.


67
00:05:40.168 --> 00:05:43.583
You know, he was with his family.

68
00:05:43.798 --> 00:05:48.091
I didn't wanna trip, you know, cos his
people was there. His pops was there.


69
00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:51.635
I didn't wanna trip. I just played
the background and kicked it.


70
00:05:51.847 --> 00:05:54.420
I'll catch him, you know,
at a swap meet or somethin'.


71
00:05:54.642 --> 00:05:59.221
Question, Flav.
How does CB4 fit into the world of rap?


72
00:05:59.437 --> 00:06:02.012
Let me tell you somethin'.
They don't fit, you know?


73
00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:04.059
They're kinda wack. Word up, G.

74
00:06:04.277 --> 00:06:09.354
Yo, man, they perpetrators, man. The
whole nine. They real fuckin' fake, kid.


75
00:06:09.574 --> 00:06:14.152
I think It's unfair that Cell Block 4
is being picked on...


76
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.997
At other concerts where they have
rat heads, cat heads being bit off,


77
00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:23.253
spittin' in a cup and passing it around,
gettin' it back and drinkin' it...


78
00:06:23.463 --> 00:06:28.092
First of all, motherfucker need
to cut that long shit he got drippin'.


79
00:06:28.303 --> 00:06:31.837
All that shit, you know. Cut it down
my size or somethin', you know.


80
00:06:32.138 --> 00:06:34.808
<i>The first time I heard
Sweat Of My Balls,</i>


81
00:06:36.853 --> 00:06:41.596
I was naked with the first black woman
I've ever made love to.


82
00:06:41.815 --> 00:06:43.357
Ooh, kinky.

83
00:06:43.568 --> 00:06:45.477
How did that make you feel?

84
00:06:45.695 --> 00:06:48.946
There was actually sweat on my balls.

85
00:06:49.908 --> 00:06:54.119
<i>Not everyone had the insight
to understand CB4's greatness.</i>


86
00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:57.200
Cell Black 4? Excuse me, Cell Block 4

87
00:06:57.415 --> 00:07:00.701
has polluted the airwaves
of this nation for too long.


88
00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.834
Their record of incitement,
lewdness, poor grammar


89
00:07:05.048 --> 00:07:09.047
will see them jailed, banned
and with their feelings hurt.


90
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:13.471
As you've probably gathered, this
is notjust a movie about rap music.


91
00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:15.057
It's about much more.

92
00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:17.261
It's about this great nation of ours,

93
00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:20.018
and how it gives everybody
a chance to make it.


94
00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:24.560
It's about three ghetto kids' rise from
the mean streets to the sales sheets.


95
00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.817
- Excuse me.
- From the world's most notorious...


96
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.603
Fellas, what are you doing?

97
00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.822
That must hurt. Give that back!
That's mine! I'm shooting...


98
00:07:35.162 --> 00:07:37.072
Oh, jeez!

99
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.033
Fellas, guys, I'm sorry.

100
00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:44.083
That dumbhead editor!
He cut in the wrong take.


101
00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.291
A thousand apologies. 
I am so sorry.

102
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.463
Why did we hire this other man
instead of the brother man?


103
00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:53.013
Because the other man is much cheaper
than the brother man.


104
00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:57.016
Guys, what I need,
what my documentary is missing


105
00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.267
is really quite simple.

106
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.019
I need to know
who Cell Block 4 really is.


107
00:08:02.234 --> 00:08:05.602
I want to know how you guys think,
what you feel.


108
00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:10.613
What do you guys eat? I don't know that.
Do you like sandwiches, fondue?


109
00:08:10.825 --> 00:08:14.574
- How do you guys sleep at night?
- I'm outta here. You clown.


110
00:08:14.787 --> 00:08:18.832
- This motherfucker's bullshit.
- What did I say?


111
00:08:19.918 --> 00:08:21.709
Yo, chill.

112
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.626
I'm gonna let him hang out
with me today, all right?


113
00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:29.210
Thanks. You're not gonna be sorry.

114
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:33.213
OK, sorry.
Come on, Herb, grab your stuff.


115
00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:35.473
Corny ass motherfucker.

116
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:40.392
Again, MC, I wanna thank you
for letting me hang with you today.


117
00:08:40.605 --> 00:08:44.226
It's gonna be fun. 
Look at that Jeep!

118
00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:49.355
Cool! I drive something sorta like that.
It's a big ol' Country Squire.


119
00:08:49.574 --> 00:08:51.780
It was my dad's car. 
It's sorta like it.

120
00:09:00.043 --> 00:09:03.328
What MC Gusto just did
was rip up a state-issued ticket


121
00:09:03.547 --> 00:09:07.711
which he has no plans of paying,
a natural act of defiance by rappers.


122
00:09:07.927 --> 00:09:10.963
He's putting in a new jam
for us to listen to and...


123
00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:14.051
Yo, White!
Chill on the blow-by-blow, all right?


124
00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:15.678
I'm sorry.

00:10:33.556 --> 00:10:35.265
We gotta go.

148
00:10:37.728 --> 00:10:39.188
Get up on 'em, man.

149
00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:45.190
- My fuckin' radio!
- Need some new jams, bitch!


150
00:10:47.322 --> 00:10:49.397
Ma! Ma!

151
00:10:50.659 --> 00:10:52.699
Cool turn!

152
00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:58.325
- Only a fool would follow me up here.
- Where are we going?


153
00:11:00.084 --> 00:11:01.877
Stop right here!

154
00:11:02.922 --> 00:11:05.625
- I'm crazy but I ain't no fool.
- I ain't no fool.


155
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.886
Jeez, we got all shot up.

156
00:11:17.103 --> 00:11:21.349
There's only one word for
that kind of thing in my book. "Wild".


157
00:11:21.566 --> 00:11:23.809
You guys OK back there?

158
00:11:24.027 --> 00:11:26.433
MC, why were they shooting at us?

159
00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:28.812
Us? Us?

160
00:11:29.032 --> 00:11:31.949
They weren't shooting at us.
They were shootin' at me.


161
00:11:32.827 --> 00:11:36.955
I could've died today. It'd have gone
down as a simple-ass drive-by.


162
00:11:37.164 --> 00:11:40.250
- You know shit about Cell Block 4.
- No. That's not true.


163
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.868
- I know you guys are...
- You got lots of tape?


164
00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:45.757
Good.

165
00:11:45.967 --> 00:11:48.005
Cos I'm gonna
let you in on something.


166
00:11:48.217 --> 00:11:50.792
OK, fine.
But keep it tight. I do the narrations.


167

- Come on, Pops.


174
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:22.119
- I already got it on one.
- Put it on negative one.


175
00:12:22.338 --> 00:12:25.421
Make us both happy and turn it off.

176
00:12:25.632 --> 00:12:29.131
I like this music. I like what
it's about. I like the way it sounds.


177
00:12:29.344 --> 00:12:32.678
Albie, I don't understand
this gangster-rap attitude


178
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.764
you're so fascinated with.

179
00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:37.811
Why don't we listen to Lenny Kravitz?

180
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:41.020
It's just music. You act
as if I was plannin' a drive-by.


181
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.146
I'm gonna drive by and whip your ass
if you don't turn that music down.


182
00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:47.734
Why ain't you in school?
How come you home?


183
00:12:47.948 --> 00:12:51.196
- It's Saturday, Pops.
- So, go look at a school.


184
00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:53.616
Don't waste electricity
on that rap mess.


185
00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:56.829
- But Pop!
- Don't "but" me.


186
00:12:57.039 --> 00:13:00.409
I'll beat your ass in front of
your woman. No rap in my house.


187
00:13:00.627 --> 00:13:03.877
In our day, they sang.
That rap ain't nothin' but talkin'.


188
00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:07.755
It won't never last!
Remember black-and-white TV? Gone!


189
00:13:07.968 --> 00:13:11.135
Remember eight-tracks? Gone!
Betamax? Gone.

As you can see, my loved ones
really respected my musical taste.


205
00:14:07.946 --> 00:14:12.111
Was Stab Master Arson
also middle class?


206

<i>Well, Otis came from
a different environment altogether.</i>

Come on in, Albert.
We're just finishing dinner.


208
00:14:22.003 --> 00:14:24.496
I knew I should've came earlier.
How are you?


209
00:14:24.714 --> 00:14:28.297
- OK.
- Look, it's Albert! Hi, Albert!

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.464
What's up, Tashana,

Hi, Albert.

- What up, bro?


214
00:14:42.608 --> 00:14:45.977

- 'Bout 11.00.


215
00:14:46.196 --> 00:14:49.730
- He gotta help me with my homework.
- And relax my hair.


216
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:54.031
- And play me in Nintendo.
- And sew me a new dress.

Don't worry. Tonight we're gonna have
crazy fun! Let's pick up Rip.


224
00:15:18.187 --> 00:15:19.348
Rip is sick.

225
00:15:19.563 --> 00:15:22.600
- You see the new En Vogue video?
- Cindy is fine!


226
00:15:22.816 --> 00:15:26.103
Cindy's fine but she's not the one.
Teri's the one.


227
00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:30.938
- Then Cindy's the other one, man.
- She got them eyes!


228

I wanna suck her like a neck bone.

Correction. I wanna suck her

Euripides Smalls
was Dead Mike's real name.


232
00:15:49.637 --> 00:15:53.681
Rip came from a broken home which meant
he hustled for every dollar he made.


233
00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:55.931
Ooh, a hustler.

234

Thank you. Call again.

246
00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:58.114
Excuse me. Could you tell me

247
00:16:58.334 --> 00:17:00.125

976
-DISS.

You're so soft and tender.
I love it when you call.

- You almost ready?


252
00:17:11.305 --> 00:17:13.382
Yo, this job is nasty!

253
00:17:17.686 --> 00:17:19.644
Yeah, I'm lickin' your balls.

254
00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:28.026
Best balls I ever had.
You got King Kong balls.


255
00:17:30.492 --> 00:17:35.035
Your balls is so large...
Just big balls, I don't care.


256
00:17:38.584 --> 00:17:42.415
Peace! I hate this job.
This ain't no job for no black man!


257
00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:45.085
Yo, let's go down
to Gusto's, all right?


258
00:17:45.383 --> 00:17:47.421
We got some problems to lick.

259
00:17:49.011 --> 00:17:52.760
If you ask me,
George Jefferson was a sell-out.


260
00:17:52.973 --> 00:17:56.591
He thought success
was livin' in a white man's buildin'


261
00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:59.765
and disrespectin'
his African-American employees.


262
00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.931
No, you don't understand.
The cool thing about George Jefferson


263
00:18:04.152 --> 00:18:08.019
was he hated every white person he met,
unless they had a cheque for him.


264
00:18:08.239 --> 00:18:10.861
Tom Willis come over,
the door slammed in his face.


265
00:18:11.075 --> 00:18:15.157
But soon as somebody had a cheque for
him, "Hey, Weezie, fix him up a plate."


266
00:18:15.372 --> 00:18:18.076
- Ain't I right, Otis?
- Yeah, right and tight.


267
00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:20.368
That's a real role model to me.

268
00:18:20.585 --> 00:18:23.077
- Do you got the tape?
- Yeah, but I'm Run.


269
00:18:23.296 --> 00:18:25.540
- I'm DMC.
- Why can't I be DMC?


270
00:18:25.758 --> 00:18:29.007
- Cos you Jam Master Jay.
- I'm always Jam Master.


271
00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:32.340
Me and you will do DMC together,
is that all right with you?


272
00:18:32.557 --> 00:18:33.552

291
00:19:53.808 --> 00:19:58.556
Now you've got me completely scrambled
up here. I thought you were Gusto.


292
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:01.477
Chill. You'll understand
everything in a minute.


293
00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:06.353
<i>Every week we go to Gusto's
and check out open mic nights.</i>


294
00:20:06.571 --> 00:20:10.699
<i>It was all right.
First we were the Mad Bohemians.</i>


295
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:12.867
<i>♪ We're The Bohemians
and you gotta put us on</i>


296
00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:14.488
<i>♪ We're The Bohemians...</i>

297
00:20:14.703 --> 00:20:17.326
<i>Then we did a thing
called The Bag Heads.</i>


298
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.328
<i>♪ The Bag Head, The Bag Heads
The Bag Heads...</i>


299
00:20:20.543 --> 00:20:23.214
<i>Then we did a thing called
The Overweight Lovers.</i>


300
00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:25.793
<i>♪ We're fat, we're fat
We're fat, we're fat...</i>


301
00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:31.673
<i>You know, I look back
at that time as sort of paying dues.</i>


302
00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:35.553
<i>We met people at Gusto's
who would forever change our lives.</i>


303
00:20:36.976 --> 00:20:41.022
Brothers, my name is Baa Baa Ack.

304
00:20:41.232 --> 00:20:45.560
I carry the message to the black man
with me wherever I go.


305
00:20:45.777 --> 00:20:48.565
I got my message right here, black man.

306
00:20:48.782 --> 00:20:50.940
We don't need that back-to
-Egypt shit.

307
00:20:51.159 --> 00:20:56.401
But between these pages lies the key
to the salvation of the race.


308
00:20:56.622 --> 00:21:01.700
Me myself, I am building a boat to carry
the sun people back to Africa.


309
00:21:02.546 --> 00:21:05.465
If you get with the programme,
you can get on the boat.


310
00:21:06.175 --> 00:21:09.341
You should stop by for additional
spiritual instruction.


311
00:21:10.512 --> 00:21:12.553
Thanks, brother. 
I'll do that, man.

312
00:21:12.765 --> 00:21:18.719
My proud black warrior,
the book costs $14.95 plus sales tax.


313
00:21:18.937 --> 00:21:22.770
Come on, brother! How come this
black power shit costs so much money?


314
00:21:23.443 --> 00:21:25.602
The revolution must be marketed.

315
00:21:27.572 --> 00:21:29.149
You're wastin' good money.

316
00:21:29.364 --> 00:21:32.532
I'm investing in my spirituality.
You need to do the same.


317
00:21:32.744 --> 00:21:35.413
The only thing I need
to invest in is getting paid.


318
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.169
Shit!

319
00:21:42.379 --> 00:21:43.921
What's up, sweetness?

320
00:21:45.007 --> 00:21:48.341
Hi. I'm Sissy.

321
00:21:48.553 --> 00:21:49.879
S
-S
-S
-S...

322
00:21:50.095 --> 00:21:51.209
The one and only.

323
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.099
I done heard your name
on the lips of many rappers.


324
00:21:54.309 --> 00:21:56.717
That's how I like it.

325
00:21:56.937 --> 00:22:01.063
- Like what?
- Me on a lot of rappers' lips.


326
00:22:02.483 --> 00:22:04.855
I'm a businessman,
and this is a business.


327
00:22:05.069 --> 00:22:06.611
Hey, Trustus.

328
00:22:06.821 --> 00:22:11.234
Trustus! When you gonna let us book
Wackee Dee and Sun Shine in this joint?


329
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.775
We got the hottest spot in all Locash.

330
00:22:13.996 --> 00:22:17.494
I have to admit
this is a wonderful place.


331
00:22:17.707 --> 00:22:22.499
But what you've got to remember
is Wackee Dee is more than a rapper.


332
00:22:22.712 --> 00:22:25.203
Wackee Dee is an entertainer.
Right, baby?


333
00:22:25.423 --> 00:22:29.838
Looky here, man. I plan on givin'
a big party in this place tomorrow.


334
00:22:30.096 --> 00:22:33.510
You understand?
And Wackee Dee is gonna be in the house.


335
00:22:33.724 --> 00:22:37.141
Give me a call tomorrow.
We can talk about it.


336
00:22:38.938 --> 00:22:42.437
Punk! All these record company punks
is a bunch of bitches.


337
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:43.645
Bitches.

338
00:22:46.238 --> 00:22:47.981
Damn!

339
00:22:48.197 --> 00:22:53.025
I got my own personal photo gallery
of friends that I've met along the way.


340
00:22:53.243 --> 00:22:54.239
Oh, yeah?

341
00:22:54.452 --> 00:22:57.657
- Would you like to see?
- You know it.


342
00:23:02.214 --> 00:23:05.796
I like to photograph my friends
in a position to please.


343
00:23:06.008 --> 00:23:07.800
Vanilla Spice.

344
00:23:08.635 --> 00:23:10.675
If you know what I'm sayin'.

345
00:23:14.474 --> 00:23:20.514
Get large, and maybe I'll let you
take a picture with me too.


346
00:23:21.858 --> 00:23:23.601
Maybe.

347
00:23:25.652 --> 00:23:27.610
Goddamn!

348
00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:31.522
- What you lookin' at, punk?
- Nothin'. I'm sorry.


349
00:23:32.704 --> 00:23:37.530
- What's your name, bitch?
- Albert. Albert Brown.


350
00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:42.922
Gusto, I just wanna say thanks a lot
for letting us perform here.


351
00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:45.204
I really appreciate it.

352
00:23:46.382 --> 00:23:47.793
Yeah, baby.

353
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:50.003
I gots to get up in that.

354
00:23:54.768 --> 00:24:00.009
Silly-ass bitch. She only go out with
rappers, entertainers, shit like that.


355
00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:02.722
She don't know
where to get the real big dick.


356
00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:04.106
Big dick.

357
00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:09.444
Excuse me, Gusto. If Wackee Dee plays
here, could we be the opening act?


358
00:24:10.742 --> 00:24:12.865
- You dismissed.
- Come on, man.


359
00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:16.328
- We're gettin' our shit together...
- When I say "go" you go.


360
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.698
Yo, what's going on?
What's up, man?


361
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:22.331
What, your posse
'spose to be deep now?


362
00:24:25.592 --> 00:24:27.498
Brother, you seem easily upset.

363
00:24:34.975 --> 00:24:35.972
Damn!

364
00:24:38.729 --> 00:24:41.647
- Shit.
- I should fuck you up!


365
00:24:41.857 --> 00:24:43.138
Damn.

366
00:24:46.697 --> 00:24:49.365
You better have some cash.

367
00:24:49.573 --> 00:24:51.484
Come on, look.

368
00:24:53.037 --> 00:24:56.369
Fellas, come here! 
Let me talk to you.

369
00:24:56.582 --> 00:25:01.041
Look, you guys can rap,
but you got nothin' I can sell.


370
00:25:01.252 --> 00:25:03.744
If you get it
together, give me a call.

371
00:25:05.132 --> 00:25:07.885
- Where were we?
- What's up, baby?


372
00:25:08.094 --> 00:25:11.094
You know who that was?
That was Trustus Jones!


373
00:25:11.304 --> 00:25:13.878
Trustus Jones,
the motherfuckin' mogul of rap!


374
00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:17.302
That's fine. Maybe in the future,
we can tap that resource.


375
00:25:17.519 --> 00:25:19.762
Right now we got
a very serious problem.


376
00:25:19.981 --> 00:25:24.442
Gusto's is the only place in Locash that
showcases rap. We need to get back in.


377
00:25:24.652 --> 00:25:28.318
You gotta take your Slim-Fast ass
back in there and apologise.


378
00:25:28.532 --> 00:25:30.690
- I don't wanna go in there.
- C'mon, man.


379
00:25:30.907 --> 00:25:32.817
Now, man. C'mon.

380
00:25:37.165 --> 00:25:38.161
Bitch!

381
00:25:40.128 --> 00:25:43.541
Tomorrow. Tomorrow, all right?

382
00:25:45.215 --> 00:25:48.299
"Now, listen, motherfucker.
I'm runnin' shit."


383
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:49.792
Nope. He'll kill me.

384
00:25:50.013 --> 00:25:53.297
"Gusto, you need us, baby."
Nope. He'll slap me.


385
00:25:53.515 --> 00:25:57.216
"Check this out. I'm here to kiss
your ass. Show me where to pucker up."


386
00:25:57.436 --> 00:25:58.468
He's gonna kill me.

387
00:25:58.688 --> 00:26:02.731
Hope this shit is better than last time.
My name's attached to this shit.


388
00:26:03.901 --> 00:26:05.562
- It's good.
- Yeah, it's good.


389
00:26:05.778 --> 00:26:09.478
40 Dog, get on the door.
Show him the cash.


390
00:26:12.911 --> 00:26:15.484
That's enough for five birds.
Let's see 'em.


391
00:26:21.754 --> 00:26:25.832
- Hey, you got the time?
- Sure, 3.00.


392
00:26:46.654 --> 00:26:48.647
- No!
- Who the fuck is that?


393
00:26:48.865 --> 00:26:52.150
- Don't worry. That kid, Albert.
- What the fuck does he want?


394
00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:54.824
Probably just wanna kiss your ass!

395
00:26:55.038 --> 00:26:57.872
He is an ass-kissin' motherfucker.
It's cool.


396
00:26:58.625 --> 00:27:00.167
Ass-kickin' motherfucker!

397
00:27:04.633 --> 00:27:07.204
Hi, Mr 40 Dog.

398
00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:10.130
I was just wonderin'
if Gusto were around.


399
00:27:10.346 --> 00:27:15.258
Remember where it comes from,
who gets that kind of cash in Locash.


400
00:27:15.477 --> 00:27:18.808
- Gusto, how's it go?
- Freeze! Get down now!


401
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.809
Freeze! Get down! Freeze!

402
00:27:22.692 --> 00:27:24.484
You too!

403
00:27:26.278 --> 00:27:29.529
- Well, happy birthday, Gusto.
- My birthday was last week.


404
00:27:29.741 --> 00:27:32.149
I wanted you to have
something to celebrate.


405
00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:35.039
- Fake-ass Bruce Willis.
- You can let him go.


406
00:27:35.248 --> 00:27:38.116
- He's OK.
- You set me up?


407
00:27:38.749 --> 00:27:42.582
- You set me up?
- I saw him talking to the cops.


408
00:27:42.797 --> 00:27:45.833
You dead, bitch. Better buy
a black dress for your mama.


409
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.465
- Cell Block 4 is waiting.
- Ain't nothin' but brick and steel.


410
00:27:49.802 --> 00:27:52.260
That can't hold Gusto.
That can't hold Gusto!


411
00:27:52.597 --> 00:27:55.089
Gusto! Gusto! Gusto!

412
00:27:58.937 --> 00:28:00.846
Stay back!

413
00:28:09.489 --> 00:28:11.696
Let's go. Bring him out here.

414
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:14.401
Gusto! Gusto! Gusto!

415
00:28:23.338 --> 00:28:24.797
I'm gonna get you, punk.

416
00:28:25.007 --> 00:28:28.957
Think it's over?
You embarrassed me like this?


417
00:28:29.179 --> 00:28:31.384
Gusto! Gusto! Gusto!

418
00:28:31.596 --> 00:28:35.511
<i>Now, Gusto was no Nino Brown,
but he was large in Locash.</i>


419
00:28:35.727 --> 00:28:39.476
<i>When I heard them chant his name,
I figured he won't need it anytime soon.</i>


420
00:28:41.147 --> 00:28:44.233
- Brother, I don't know, man.
- Listen to me.


421
00:28:44.444 --> 00:28:49.022
We take Gusto's image,
make ourselves into hard-core rappers.


422
00:28:49.241 --> 00:28:51.648
Then we take stories from Gusto's life.

423
00:28:51.866 --> 00:28:54.822
- Get Trustus Jones to handle us.
- I ain't with it.


424
00:28:55.037 --> 00:28:58.490
- I'm the only one taking a real risk.
- How's that?


425
00:28:58.708 --> 00:29:02.124
Cos from now on
I'll be known as MC Gusto.


426
00:29:03.213 --> 00:29:06.547
We'll be Cell Block 4,
after the joint they threw Gusto in.


427
00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:10.211
You buggin'? You couldn't
pick a name besides that nigga Gusto?


428
00:29:10.473 --> 00:29:13.471
"Nigga"? You already
becomin' a gangster!


429
00:29:13.682 --> 00:29:16.969
No, cousin, I can't let you go
out like that. I'm not havin' it.


430
00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:21.019
- I say we vote on it, and I vote yes.
- I vote no three times.


431
00:29:21.233 --> 00:29:23.723
You only get one vote.
Otis, how you feel?


432
00:29:23.942 --> 00:29:26.778
Otis, you and I both
know it's suicide, man.


433
00:29:28.364 --> 00:29:31.900
Otis, what about Sissy?
Think about Sissy.


434
00:29:32.119 --> 00:29:35.782
I know you want
to get in there. Sissy.

435
00:29:37.416 --> 00:29:40.582
That's it.
Assume the position, baby.


436
00:29:41.337 --> 00:29:42.617

437
00:29:44.465 --> 00:29:47.501

Yo, listen. Excuse me, man.
Do you work in radio?


440
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:59.932
- No, nigga.
- Wait a minute. An answering service?


441
00:30:00.147 --> 00:30:02.186
No, nigga.
Eat your big-ass biscuit.


442
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:06.064
Hey, it don't have to be about all that.
It's your speaking voice.


443
00:30:06.278 --> 00:30:08.355
It's so... familiar.

444
00:30:10.951 --> 00:30:14.900
- Yeah.
- You brothers is all I got. I'm in!


445
00:30:15.122 --> 00:30:18.704
But I gotta tell you, if I get
something better to do, I'm steppin'.


446

make so much money, get so many girlies.

Are you sure you wanna be Gusto? Why not

Let me ask you a couple of questions.


474
00:31:39.835 --> 00:31:42.503

- Yeah.
- Whenever possible.


479
00:31:56.852 --> 00:32:00.932
Do you glorify violence
or advocate the use of guns


480
00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:04.149
as a way of solving a civil dispute?
OK, final question.


481
00:32:04.359 --> 00:32:06.234

- That's exactly my point.

- You're here to give the group a piece?

- Why you disrespect this sister?

00:35:07.385 --> 00:35:08.927

A pen is all you have in
your pants, it's out of ink.

- Watch it, ho!
- Ho?

This is not Christmas,
you slender slice of sexist slime,


540

- It's my pleasure, sister Edwards.

No, please, call me Eve.

545
00:35:34.745 --> 00:35:37.451
- You know...
- I am not a groupie.


546
00:35:37.666 --> 00:35:41.035
I am a journalist.
I take no shorts and I do my research.


547
00:35:41.254 --> 00:35:45.250
I can do a nice puffy feature
that reports exactly what you tell me,


548
00:35:45.465 --> 00:35:50.128
or I can delve so deeply
into your background


549
00:35:50.346 --> 00:35:52.967
with an eye for every inconsistency,

550
00:35:53.182 --> 00:35:56.847
your mother would disavow
any knowledge of your birth.


551
00:35:57.061 --> 00:36:02.566
Now, which would you prefer, Albert?

552
00:36:06.987 --> 00:36:09.657

This video exposure is too come-and-go.

557

we gotta go, gotta go.


562
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:40.978

564
00:36:43.984 --> 00:36:48.979
It's fine and dandy to go out with these
guys and to drive around in their car,


565
00:36:49.198 --> 00:36:51.903
and have them take you
to an expensive restaurant.


566
00:36:52.118 --> 00:36:56.282
But if all you get out of it
is a fuck, then you's a ho.


567
00:36:58.248 --> 00:37:02.164
But you get yourself
a fabulous motor vehicle,


568
00:37:02.379 --> 00:37:06.793
a fine house and can afford
to pay for your own meals,


569
00:37:07.009 --> 00:37:09.630
then you are a businesswoman.

00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:35.485
- Who?
- I mean MC Gusto.


575

Yeah, he's kinda cute.

00:47:07.176 --> 00:47:10.379
by wearing a baseball cap backwards,

726
00:47:10.597 --> 00:47:13.217
well, that's an evil
that speaks for itself.


727
00:47:23.609 --> 00:47:28.521
See! See how those demons
have poisoned my seed!


728
00:47:28.739 --> 00:47:30.816
Ben! Ben!

729
00:47:34.328 --> 00:47:35.609
Ben!

730
00:47:35.831 --> 00:47:38.287
Ben! Come here, son!

731
00:47:40.543 --> 00:47:43.746
To some people, these fools
out here could be a problem.


732
00:47:43.964 --> 00:47:45.921
Bad for the image,
bad for sales.


733
00:47:46.134 --> 00:47:51.376
But you, brothers,
have created something so nasty,


734
00:47:51.597 --> 00:47:54.598
so vile, that the iller you get,
the better off we are.


735
00:47:54.891 --> 00:47:58.724
- Now go out there and have a good time.
- No problem.


736
00:47:58.939 --> 00:48:01.393
By the way,
I almost forgot to tell you.


737
00:48:01.608 --> 00:48:03.232
Gusto escaped from prison.

738
00:48:03.443 --> 00:48:06.443
He has vowed to dismember
everybody in the group.


739
00:48:06.654 --> 00:48:07.651
Knock 'em dead.

740
00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.232
Get back! Get back!

741
00:48:13.579 --> 00:48:15.404
Trustus? Trustus, hi.

742
00:48:15.622 --> 00:48:18.991
- Hi, Eve. I love the piece you did.
- You should thank Dead Mike.


743
00:48:19.209 --> 00:48:22.245
You aware they might be
arrested for indecency tonight?


744
00:48:22.463 --> 00:48:25.795
Cell Block 4 is not afraid to go
to jail. Cell Block 4 is from jail!


745
00:48:26.007 --> 00:48:29.378
It would be like sendin' 'em home!
Sissy? Baby, where are ya?


746
00:48:29.595 --> 00:48:31.504
There you are.

747
00:48:31.972 --> 00:48:35.056
Can I have your autograph?
Yeah, yeah, little kiddie.


748
00:48:35.268 --> 00:48:38.303
Stab Master, CB4.

749
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.928
- Keep it as a souvenir.
- Thanks.


750
00:48:41.149 --> 00:48:44.066
- Let's go, baby.
- Come on, Dad. It's only an...


751
00:48:46.279 --> 00:48:49.114
Hey, hey, wait. Who is this?

752
00:48:49.324 --> 00:48:52.776
- She looks too cute to be your woman.
- Remember what time it is!


753
00:48:52.993 --> 00:48:56.447
- She's my cousin, my cousin.
- What?


754
00:48:57.581 --> 00:48:59.491
Are you OK?

755
00:49:04.005 --> 00:49:05.798
Man, look at this funky asshole.

756
00:49:06.008 --> 00:49:10.420
That bitch wouldn't give me the time
of day because I wasn't an entertainer,


757
00:49:10.638 --> 00:49:12.512
because I wasn't a star.

758
00:49:12.724 --> 00:49:15.844
Don't the bitch know that
we're the motherfuckin' stars?


759
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.053
That's all right.

760
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:21.391
Because now I'm gonna get
paid off from them. You know how?


761
00:49:21.607 --> 00:49:23.814
Pimp 'em like
the bitches that they are.


762
00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:25.686
Pimp them motherfuckin' hos.

763
00:49:27.363 --> 00:49:29.439
<i>With Daliha out of the picture,</i>

764
00:49:29.657 --> 00:49:31.734
<i>I decided to see what Sissy
was all about.</i>


765
00:49:31.951 --> 00:49:35.319
<i>The only problem was, so did Dead Mike.</i>

766
00:51:00.459 --> 00:51:02.833
Come to big daddy.

767
00:51:30.074 --> 00:51:32.031
I ain't goin' down there.

768
00:52:10.283 --> 00:52:11.279
Shit.

769
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.168
CB4, where you at?

770
00:52:25.381 --> 00:52:26.378
CB4, where you at?

771
00:52:34.267 --> 00:52:36.305
Yo, we livin' crazy large.

772
00:52:36.519 --> 00:52:39.436
We got the girls,
we got the money, we got the gold.


773
00:52:39.646 --> 00:52:42.980
And we're one spot behind Wackee Dee.
Takin' out all that rap.


774
00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:47.107
- I'm glad you happy, cos I'm not.
- Man, what's your beef?


775
00:52:47.322 --> 00:52:51.864
All this gangster mess, man.
People protestin'. That ain't for me.


776
00:52:52.076 --> 00:52:54.449
I like the music.
I like the fly-ass girlies.


777
00:52:54.662 --> 00:52:57.331
I also like when I help
my sisters around the house.


778
00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:01.408
One nigga wants to be Malcolm X,
the other wants to be Richie Cunningham.


779
00:53:01.628 --> 00:53:03.835
Yo, the devil's in full effect.

780
00:53:06.298 --> 00:53:09.882
Hey, there's nothin'
to worry about. Trust me.


781
00:53:12.931 --> 00:53:16.763
In my role as head of the Sacramento
City Council's Board of Decency,


782
00:53:16.977 --> 00:53:20.394
I, Virgil Robinson,
am here to inform you that:


783
00:53:20.607 --> 00:53:24.854
"Under penalty of arrest
you cannot touch your genitalia.


784
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:28.569
The word 'ho' can only be used
in reference to a garden tool.


785
00:53:28.781 --> 00:53:32.196
The word 'bitch' may only be used
when describing female dogs,


786
00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:34.450
and then only when in heat.

787
00:53:34.663 --> 00:53:37.580
The word 'blow job' can only
be used in describing a job


788
00:53:37.791 --> 00:53:41.160
blowing up balloons
or children's animals."


789
00:53:41.379 --> 00:53:42.657
Do I make myself clear?

790
00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:48.087
<i>And under no circumstances,
are you to perform Sweat...</i>


791
00:53:50.304 --> 00:53:53.010
<i>... Sweat Of My Balls tonight.</i>

00:53:57.979 --> 00:54:03.140

00:54:35.142 --> 00:54:38.808

Now, I may be in here

I do have a sensitive side.

So I'd like to read you
a poem. It's called

- "I didn't do it".
- My man got a poem.

"Just because I had the cash
doesn't mean I killed his ass.

I didn't do it.

Just because
the blood was in my hand

doesn't mean I stabbed the man.

I didn't do it."

<i>My name is Malik from the

to uplift the community
in economic terms.


863

Man, I'm tired of these
black questions, man.

Ask Michael J Fox
what he's doin' for the yuppies?

Ask Sylvester Stallone
what he's doin' for the Italians?


866
00:58:52.912 --> 00:58:57.739
Brother, I'd like it to be known that I
am reinvesting in the black community.


867
00:58:57.958 --> 00:59:00.495
I am opening a chain

our disenfranchised black youth.

MC Gusto,
my African-American women readers


870
00:59:09.096 --> 00:59:11.881
would like to know why
you refer to women as bitches.


871
00:59:12.097 --> 00:59:16.842
Yo, women, bitches, hos...
people with pussies.


872
00:59:17.394 --> 00:59:18.889

- Pussy for everybody.
- Yeah, pussies!


874
00:59:22.482 --> 00:59:24.144
- Know what I'm sayin'?
- I do not


875
00:59:24.361 --> 00:59:28.109
and neither would anyone with
respect for the English language.


876
00:59:28.322 --> 00:59:30.031
- Next question.
- Excuse me.


877
00:59:30.243 --> 00:59:33.158
In protest of our arrest
by the powers that be,


878
00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:37.154
we will answer no questions
from the white media!


879
00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:41.206
- Let's go.
- Press conference over!


880
00:59:49.386 --> 00:59:51.961
Well, that's the story so far.

881
00:59:52.181 --> 00:59:56.048
This is just incredible. It's amazing.

882
00:59:56.269 --> 00:59:59.887
Well, to use your words,
it's "all that".


883
01:00:00.105 --> 01:00:04.056
- It's gonna make a great video.
- I wouldn't unload my camera just yet.


884
01:00:04.276 --> 01:00:06.401
I still gotta deal with Gusto.

885
01:00:12.703 --> 01:00:13.982
- Later.
- All right.


886
01:00:16.998 --> 01:00:19.240
This bitch is really from the ghetto.

887
01:00:19.459 --> 01:00:22.164
Don't look like the ghetto to me, boss.

888
01:00:22.421 --> 01:00:24.911
"The smallest dog in
the world is the Chihuahua.


889
01:00:25.131 --> 01:00:28.169
It is named for a city in Mexico
where it became popular."


890
01:00:28.594 --> 01:00:32.093
Shut up, girl. You just think
you so smart cos you can read.


891
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:34.892
Hey, baby!

892
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:38.552
Give your grandma a big kiss!

893
01:00:38.772 --> 01:00:41.559
- So how you doin', Grandma?
- How you doin'?


894
01:00:41.774 --> 01:00:46.021
I heard you just broke out of the joint.
I didn't even know you was in there.


895
01:00:46.236 --> 01:00:48.111
It was just an overnight thing.

896
01:00:48.323 --> 01:00:51.407
Is the conjugal room still green?

897
01:00:52.118 --> 01:00:54.824
I wouldn't know about that.
It was just overnight.


898
01:00:55.039 --> 01:00:56.746
Mmm, you oughta know.

899
01:01:01.295 --> 01:01:05.589
- Hi, D.
- Hey, Albert. How was jail?


900
01:01:05.799 --> 01:01:10.508
Look, Daliha, that whole
cousin thing, I was wrong.


901
01:01:10.722 --> 01:01:15.930
I would never try
to hurt you, D. I love you.


902
01:01:16.144 --> 01:01:17.767
Look, I got you somethin'.

903
01:01:29.865 --> 01:01:34.326
Great. I'm sure that
Sissy girl would love these.


904
01:01:48.511 --> 01:01:50.134
Hey, there's a party inside.

905
01:01:52.014 --> 01:01:55.513
Your mother may have
time for a party, but me,


906
01:01:55.726 --> 01:01:59.393
- I got bills to pay.
- Why don't you take this to a carwash?


907
01:01:59.605 --> 01:02:02.180
We don't have money to take
the car to the carwash


908
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.855
every time it gets a little smudge.

909
01:02:05.068 --> 01:02:07.441
We ain't all big-time
rap stars like you.


910
01:02:13.161 --> 01:02:15.616
Son, what's on your mind?

911
01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:18.203
I work to get us
into a nice house like this,


912
01:02:18.417 --> 01:02:20.457
and you pretend to be a crook.

913
01:02:20.668 --> 01:02:22.329
- What, you ashamed of me?
- No.


914
01:02:22.546 --> 01:02:26.080
Why you go runnin' around
with gold-tooth, greasy-ass hair,


915
01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:30.630
holdin' yourjohnson like it's the
only one God created? You ain't tough.


916
01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:35.473
There are some real kids out there
who are gonna kick your narrow ass!


917
01:02:35.683 --> 01:02:38.353
You ain't from the street.
I'm from the street!


918
01:02:38.562 --> 01:02:42.394
And only somebody who wasn't
would think it was something to glorify!


919
01:02:47.947 --> 01:02:50.237
That's a pretty little thing.

920
01:02:55.414 --> 01:02:58.083
This bitch got all the bitches.

921
01:03:16.478 --> 01:03:19.513
We was just readin'
about you, bitch!


922
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:24.401
You know, your Ready-Rooter, funky-ass
truck-driving father was right.


923
01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:27.814
You ought to be ashamed of
yourself taking advantage of me.


924
01:03:28.031 --> 01:03:29.739
Gusto?

925
01:03:29.949 --> 01:03:33.948
Boy, I'm three generations
deep in gangsterdom.


926
01:03:34.162 --> 01:03:35.869
Three generations!

927
01:03:38.875 --> 01:03:41.117
Albert, are you in there?

928
01:03:41.837 --> 01:03:44.589
And your woman?
She's real fine, you know.


929
01:03:44.798 --> 01:03:47.124
I'd like to fuck her froggy style.

930
01:03:47.342 --> 01:03:50.094
- What did you say?
- I'll be out in a while.


931
01:03:50.304 --> 01:03:51.928
OK.

932
01:03:53.139 --> 01:03:57.434
- Tryin' to protect that ass?
- Protect that ass!


933
01:03:57.644 --> 01:04:01.310
- Welcome to the terrordome, bitch.
- Terrordome, bitch.


934
01:04:13.703 --> 01:04:15.911
What are you gonna do?

935
01:04:16.749 --> 01:04:20.118
- You want to be a gangster, right?
- Gangster.


936
01:04:20.335 --> 01:04:22.126
Come on, get out the car.

937
01:04:24.756 --> 01:04:27.212
Y'all know the routine.

938
01:04:27.427 --> 01:04:31.554
Y'all know the routine. Yeah!
Get them goddamn clothes off!


939
01:04:34.808 --> 01:04:35.889
Do what he says.

940
01:04:36.102 --> 01:04:39.637
Mister, yo! Put your clothes back on!
CB4 is in the house!


941
01:04:39.855 --> 01:04:42.181
CB4! You know what I'm sayin'?

942
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.935
- Get on the ground!
- Don't shoot us.


943
01:04:46.154 --> 01:04:48.940
Stay on the goddamn ground!
You, get out there, man!


944
01:04:49.782 --> 01:04:52.902
Get over there, man, get over there.
Get on the ground, move.

958
01:05:44.339 --> 01:05:48.800
- CB4, they're finally real gangsters.
- Real gangsters.


959
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:51.585
You see this right here?

960
01:05:51.806 --> 01:05:53.549
You break up the group tomorrow.

961
01:05:53.765 --> 01:05:56.932
Or else, it's goin' to everybody, MTV,

Shut up, man.

964
01:06:12.119 --> 01:06:14.490
Now CB4 is over or you're dead.

965
01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.662
40 Dog, get rid of this trash, man.

966

Punk!

967
01:06:25.673 --> 01:06:28.211
I'm callin' this private,
emergency meeting.


968
01:06:28.426 --> 01:06:32.377
I've had it with how sloppy
you two have become.


969
01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.673
- What you talkin' about?
- Shut up.


970
01:06:34.892 --> 01:06:38.095
You don't say the words
the way you're supposed to.


971
01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:40.684
You're too spiritual
to rock the crowd.


972
01:06:40.898 --> 01:06:44.813
And Otis, you used to be
the coolest virgin in the world.


973
01:06:45.027 --> 01:06:49.321
But now that you got a little pussy,
your mixing has fallen the fuck off.


974
01:06:49.532 --> 01:06:53.067
Gusto broke out ofjail, but that
ain't no reason for you to be buggin.


975
01:06:53.287 --> 01:06:55.244
- Shit.
- I'm not buggin'.


976
01:06:55.456 --> 01:06:58.373
I called this private meetin'
and look what happened!


977
01:06:59.375 --> 01:07:02.958
Hey, brothers, calm down.

978
01:07:05.467 --> 01:07:08.087
- You ain't fuckin' up on purpose?
- What?


979
01:07:08.301 --> 01:07:11.670
You and Bubba Ack wanna go solo.

980
01:07:11.888 --> 01:07:14.428
But damn, nigga, don't sabotage CB4.

981
01:07:14.642 --> 01:07:18.176
Don't be so selfish, man.
You wanna step off, step the fuck off!


982
01:07:18.395 --> 01:07:21.397
I don't know why you want me
to knock you out, but so be it!


983
01:07:21.607 --> 01:07:23.729
- What you want, man?
- Yo, you're fired!


984
01:07:23.943 --> 01:07:26.517
You can't fire me.
Vote me out like I was voted in!


985
01:07:26.739 --> 01:07:28.232
Otis, throw his ass out!

986
01:07:28.447 --> 01:07:29.991
- Fuck this.
- Otis?


987
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.568
All I wanted to do was make music
and hang out with women.


988
01:07:33.786 --> 01:07:36.538
When y'all get your
shit straight, come see me.


989
01:07:36.749 --> 01:07:38.705
That's it! Cell Block 4 is through.

990

You're free to buy
that fool his boat back to Africa.


991
01:07:41.878 --> 01:07:44.250
You did this on purpose, didn't ya?

992
01:07:45.799 --> 01:07:47.044
I'm outta here, man.

- What you up to, Albert?
- Nothin'.


1030
01:09:44.298 --> 01:09:47.252
That's what I thought.
How come you're not workin'?


1031
01:09:47.468 --> 01:09:50.717
Toaster's workin'. The VCR's workin'.
How come you're not?


1032
01:09:50.929 --> 01:09:54.513
- Almost liked it when you rapped.
- Pop, I'm in trouble.


1033
01:09:54.726 --> 01:09:58.770
You were in trouble when you decided
being Albert Brown wasn't good enough.


1034
01:09:58.979 --> 01:10:01.518
Pop, I'm tired of this MC Gusto thing.

1035
01:10:01.732 --> 01:10:04.818
I'm scared. It's over. It's over!

1036
01:10:05.028 --> 01:10:08.861
Son, that's the best thing
you've said in a long time.


1037
01:10:10.658 --> 01:10:12.568
<i>My life was messed up.</i>

1038
01:10:12.785 --> 01:10:15.657
<i>I turned into a monster.
I'd lost my friends.</i>


1039
01:10:16.748 --> 01:10:19.748
<i>I'm usin' the word "nigga"
like it's my last name.</i>


1040
01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.459
<i>Walkin'around callin' women
bitches and hos. That's not right.</i>


1041
01:10:23.672 --> 01:10:26.425
<i>My mother won't even speak to me.</i>

1042
01:10:26.634 --> 01:10:29.968
<i>Nothing's goin'right, nothin'.</i>

1043
01:10:58.917 --> 01:10:59.913
Nah.

1044
01:11:36.289 --> 01:11:38.698
Hey, Queen Latifah.

1045
01:11:38.918 --> 01:11:40.957
Go on, girl.

1046
01:11:55.101 --> 01:11:59.347
Man, those were the days.

1047
01:11:59.564 --> 01:12:02.268
I remember all those groups.

1048
01:12:02.483 --> 01:12:06.481
NWA, Ice Cube,

1049
01:12:06.696 --> 01:12:08.984
CB4.

1050
01:12:09.449 --> 01:12:11.692
Was the lead guy's name Gusto?

1051
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:15.576
- Yes!
- Shit! That nigga was a perpetrator!


1052
01:12:15.789 --> 01:12:20.001
Gusto and his whole crew
weren't real gangster rappers.


1053
01:12:20.210 --> 01:12:22.881
They was as soft
as a wet baby's ass.

1054
01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:26.671
They're straight-up fakes.

1055
01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:29.636
They damn sure weren't no Wackee Dee!

1056
01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:38.801
Yeah, boyee!

1057
01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.238
- Yeah?
- It's me, man, Rip.


1058
01:12:54.455 --> 01:12:57.123
Man, I thought
you'd be in Africa by now.


1059
01:12:57.332 --> 01:12:59.740
Cousin, this ain't no time to argue.

1060
01:13:01.169 --> 01:13:02.415
Trustus is dead.

1061
01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:05.964
What? What happened?

1062
01:13:06.175 --> 01:13:08.665
<i>Gusto bagged him
eatin'dinner with Sissy.</i>


1063
01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:11.294
He shot him?

1064
01:13:20.982 --> 01:13:24.101
Hey! Who knows the Heimlich manoeuvre?

1065
01:13:24.318 --> 01:13:26.063
- Here, I do.
- No, no, no.


1066
01:13:26.279 --> 01:13:28.105
You're not doin' it right.

1067
01:13:29.407 --> 01:13:31.778
That's not it. 
Here, let me try.

1068
01:13:36.123 --> 01:13:38.745
- Is he all right?
- He don't look so good.


1069
01:13:46.467 --> 01:13:48.755
Trustus.

1070
01:14:05.069 --> 01:14:06.564
Thought you got away?

1071
01:14:07.155 --> 01:14:11.200
Now you're layin' dead.
But we ain't settled this yet, right?


1072
01:14:11.409 --> 01:14:13.698
Where's my money, motherfucker?

1073
01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:16.285
Where's my money, motherfucker?

1074
01:14:16.498 --> 01:14:18.990
I want my money.
Funeral or no, I want my money!


1075
01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:24.167
If I have to give you mouth-to-mouth and
revive your black ass, I want my money!


1076
01:14:34.725 --> 01:14:38.641
Hey, look, we need to
go outside and talk. All right?


1077
01:14:49.283 --> 01:14:52.069
Look, I'm sorry about
everything that happened.


1078
01:14:53.328 --> 01:14:55.783
I shouldn't have let
Gusto scare me like that.


1079
01:14:57.331 --> 01:14:59.409
I think it's time we got back together.

1080
01:15:02.587 --> 01:15:04.081
It's cool with me, Al.

1081
01:15:07.342 --> 01:15:08.587
What about you, Rip?

1082
01:15:11.514 --> 01:15:12.676
Brothers...

1083
01:15:14.183 --> 01:15:16.010
...let the past be in the past, man.

1084
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:20.940
All right, it's about time
for CB4 to head back to the stage.


1085
01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.941
We have to do this for Trustus.

1086
01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.723
We gotta let people
know that CB4 is for real.


1087
01:15:25.944 --> 01:15:28.483
I'm with that, but what
we gonna do about Gusto?


1088
01:15:28.698 --> 01:15:31.866
Trustus is laying in there
because of this clown.


1089
01:15:32.077 --> 01:15:36.121
- We gonna let him get away with that?
- Don't worry. We're gonna get Gusto


1090
01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:38.619
and we're gonna get back on stage.

1091
01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:40.790
Now, listen to this.

1092
01:15:41.002 --> 01:15:43.044
What we have to do...

1093
01:15:49.428 --> 01:15:51.753
Yo, when I get finished
with those CB4 kids,


1094
01:15:51.973 --> 01:15:54.546
they gonna be CB0.

1095
01:15:54.768 --> 01:15:56.391
Yo, hurry up back, man.

1096
01:16:02.108 --> 01:16:04.599
- Yeah, who this?
- Hi, Gusto.


1097
01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:07.772
This is Sissy.
You remember Sissy, don't you?


1098
01:16:07.988 --> 01:16:10.610
How could I forget
the bitch that ditched me?


1099
01:16:12.577 --> 01:16:15.578
Well, that was then
and this is now.


1100
01:16:15.789 --> 01:16:19.240
And if you're ready
for something really special,


1101
01:16:19.459 --> 01:16:22.460
why don't you meet me
at the Honeyroll Hotel


1102
01:16:22.671 --> 01:16:25.342
on Locash Boulevard in an hour?

1103
01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.218
So you're finally ready
for the big dick, huh?


1104
01:16:48.489 --> 01:16:50.731
So, you know,

1105
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:54.949
I've been waiting for this
moment for a real long time.


1106
01:16:56.708 --> 01:16:59.991
I just love hearin' about anything...

1107
01:17:00.625 --> 01:17:02.749
...long.

1108
01:17:04.089 --> 01:17:07.625
You know, I got
a little present for you, babe.


1109
01:17:07.844 --> 01:17:10.512
- Yeah?
- It's right over here.


1110
01:17:15.642 --> 01:17:19.060
Check it out. Got my Jimmy hat.

1111
01:17:19.273 --> 01:17:21.975
Oh, my.

1112
01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:26.438
Yeah, nice and large,
baby, just like me.


1113
01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:35.487
Nah, baby, you better try this one.

1114
01:17:35.705 --> 01:17:39.206
Jokes. Enough with this foreplay.

1115
01:17:39.419 --> 01:17:42.287
- I'm gonna get busy, baby.
- Hey, wait a minute.


1116
01:17:42.504 --> 01:17:45.077
- What's up?
- Why don't you let me


1117
01:17:45.298 --> 01:17:48.253
slip into something
a little more comfortable?


1118
01:17:48.469 --> 01:17:50.961
Slip into something
more comfortable?


1119
01:17:51.179 --> 01:17:54.928
Bitch, what could be more comfortable
than what you already got on?


1120
01:17:55.142 --> 01:17:56.517
Don't worry.

1121
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:59.848
You won't be disappointed.

1122
01:18:00.774 --> 01:18:02.102
Damn, bitch.

1123
01:18:07.154 --> 01:18:11.652
You know, you been talkin'
a lot of shit lately.


1124
01:18:11.869 --> 01:18:15.912
I sure hope you ready for this, baby.

1125
01:18:16.122 --> 01:18:17.866
Oh, yeah, baby. 
I'm real ready.

1126
01:18:27.426 --> 01:18:28.422
Oh, yeah!

01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:34.170
Yeah, I'm ready.

1128
01:18:46.947 --> 01:18:50.480
I'm gonna get some pussy.

Yeah!

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.328
Come on, sugar dumplin'.

1131
01:19:00.543 --> 01:19:04.459
- Daddy's waitin' for ya.
- Turn the lights down, baby.


1132
01:19:05.549 --> 01:19:07.505
You don't like to watch.

1133
01:19:07.717 --> 01:19:11.762
I'll turn it down for ya.
Come on now.


1134
01:19:15.892 --> 01:19:18.347
Now get down on your hands and knees.

1135
01:19:18.562 --> 01:19:23.058
My hands and knees?
You're gonna make things difficult, huh?


1136
01:19:23.275 --> 01:19:27.604
OK, I'll get down on my hands
and knees. I'll play your little game.


1137
01:19:27.822 --> 01:19:31.487
- Now, crawl over here.
- I don't mind crawlin'.


1138
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:36.447
- I don't mind beggin' either, baby.
- Assume the position.


1139
01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:39.998
I'll assume the position,
I assume we're gettin' ready to fuck.


1140
01:19:41.712 --> 01:19:44.380
Damn, bitch! You!

1141
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:46.879
- What are you doin'?
- Who's the bitch?


1142
01:19:48.010 --> 01:19:50.547
- Damn you, bitch.
- Get up!


1143
01:19:50.763 --> 01:19:54.179
- Come on!
- I was the biggest man in Locash.


1144
01:19:54.391 --> 01:19:56.432
So, you call yourself a man?

1145
01:19:57.521 --> 01:20:00.270
You gonna pay. 
You gots to pay.

1146
01:20:02.316 --> 01:20:05.401
- Shit!
- Don't even try it.


1147
01:20:06.239 --> 01:20:07.696
Freeze!

1148
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:12.108
Man, not again.

1149
01:20:15.497 --> 01:20:18.167
We got your gangster ass now, don't we?

1150
01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:21.578
Tiger drawers wearin' motherfucker.

1151
01:20:22.212 --> 01:20:24.003
Fuck you, man.

1152
01:20:28.678 --> 01:20:30.587
Get out!

1153
01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:35.758
Shut up!

1154
01:20:35.976 --> 01:20:38.100

Nah!

Well, we're backstage at Gusto's.

1159
01:21:13.514 --> 01:21:16.006
You can really feel
the electricity here.


1160
01:21:16.226 --> 01:21:20.391
We're anxiously anticipating
the big CB4 reunion show


1161
01:21:20.607 --> 01:21:22.682
which is about
to start any moment now.


1162
01:21:22.901 --> 01:21:25.570
The fellows are
putting the final touches


1163
01:21:25.778 --> 01:21:28.352
on their make-up, mascara, pancake...

1164
01:21:28.573 --> 01:21:30.780
- Small world!
- They're comin' out.


1165
01:21:30.993 --> 01:21:34.029
- Yeah!
- All right, fellows. OK, hi.


1166
01:21:34.245 --> 01:21:38.030
Well, this is it. What are you guys
gonna do after the show, huh?


1167
01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:40.622
Yo, me myself,
