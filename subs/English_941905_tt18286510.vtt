1
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.420
There's a trust level amongst us that
we just, you can't find anywhere else.


2
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.900
It just comes from having been
through everything together.


3
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.860
Record this?!

4
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.516
We never had these massive
ambitions when we started out at all.


5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.420
We were just this weird rock band
that were trying to piss people off.


6
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.340
We never took advice
from anybody.


7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.100
We just put our hoods up and
turned and faced the back.


8
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.980
We just kept goin.

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.620
But when it comes to just what makes
us, us and what makes us unique,


10
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.700
It's got a lot to do with
this part of the world.


11
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.980
It stands for "Big
Imagination For Feeling Young.


12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.700
'Cause Life Yearns Real
Optimism".


13
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.220
That's what it stands
for. That's an acronym.


14
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.020
- What does BIFFY CLYRO mean?
- What does it mean?


15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.260
It's what's keeping us alive.

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.156
It made me realize, "This is
something we haven't done!"


17
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.860
Just being our own wee
gaffe, no adults around.


18
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.180
It can remind me of how much
I need this personally.


19
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.180
That's a good place to
be after 20 years.


20
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.476
It really feels like you've got
a wee secret at that point.


21
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.940
A wee secret that the world
doesn't know about.


22
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.900
It's by far the most grassroots
thing we've done.


23
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.060
One new idea was, "Woah this
is great this is new!


24
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.140
"I don't know what this is but
it's gonna be a treat!"


25
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.020
The three of us in this
bloody dairy farm.


26
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.660
It's a whole rebirth
that's started again.


27
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.740
I don't even know if the label knew
we were making an album at first.


28
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.700
It was literally making music for the
sake of making music 'cause we love it.


29
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.980
It felt like we were kids again.

30
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.420
- Hello!
- Hello mate how you doin?


31
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.620
- How you doin?
- Not bad not bad!


32
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.220
- Yeah.
- Givin the old bit a race as well.


33
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.060
Thanks for coming to Bonaire, my
part of the world.


34
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.260
If you do a wee full 180 there you'll
see a beautiful view of the coast.


35
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.500
And uh yeah this is where
I was born and raised.


36
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.940
It's very much a part of my identity
and the identity of the band I guess.


37
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.220
This is like the first year we
haven't travelled in probably 21 years.


38
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.340
We've always been on the move
and I've found that inspiring for years


39
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.380
and I've been scared of stopping.
In case it stops the inspiration,


40
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.740
but actually this last year
I've felt just as inspired.


41
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.300
After the shock of the
initial lockdown.


42
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.740
You know and just being able to do things
like this, have a day to go do the beach.


43
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.500
I don't think I've
ever done this.


44
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.780
Finally after 20 years we've
made a record in Ayrshire.


45
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.340
You know it's like our first
top to bottom Scottish record.


46
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.660
- BIFFY fucking CLYRO.
- BIFFY CLYRO!


47
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.940
- It's BIFFY CLYRO!
- Born the BIFF!


48
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.580
BIFFY CLYRO!

49
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.420
Hello gentlemen. Interrogation
time is it? Interrogation time.


50
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.620
It's gonna get hot
in here.


51
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.900
Check my hair.

52
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.340
Simon interview, take one!

53
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.060
So, cast your mind
back mate.


54
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.740
It's 2019. You're recording 'A
Celebration of Endings' over in LA.


55
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.540
What are your memories of that time out
in the basking sunshine of Los Angeles?


56
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.220
It now feels like a long time ago. 2019
it feels... like a different mind almost.


57
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.460
I think back to that time,
life was a lot easier.


58
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.540
You know we were just there
making our music in LA like we've done


59
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.620
so many times before.

60
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.900
It feels like a kind of natural
place for us to be.


61
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.340
For us it's always been quite an important
part to kind of go as far away from home,


62
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.860
and feel like we're in a part of the
world where anything is possible.


63
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.260
You know writing the songs and
everything and the essence


64
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.340
and the soul of the music is
very Scottish.


65
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.516
But when I'm making a record
with Ben and James as well,


66
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.780
we don't want to feel
those limitations.


67
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.180
Over in LA in North
America you can definitely dream


68
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.740
big and nobody checks you for
it.


69
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.140
You know when you're making a
record you wanna shoot for the stars so.


70
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.900
LA's a good place to do that.

71
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.340
When the band's in the studio and we
get the songs to a point where we're happy


72
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.420
that's true elation. Like nobody
can touch you at that point.


73
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.900
Living together like the Brady Bunch in
a house is really a huge part of it for me.


74
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.820
It's really a big part of the comradery
of giving you that fighting spirit.


75
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.300
That you're all in it together.

76
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.860
They're never gonna
hear that coming!


77
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.700
- No I mean, two choruses are always better than one.
- They're never gonna hear that...


78
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.220
We create the worst bike
gang that LA's ever seen.


79
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.500
Us and our little
push bikes.


80
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.916
- Like three wee guys from the west coast of Scotland.
- Yeah!


81
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.260
And we're kind of over there
living our dreams.


82
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.700
Those are the moments that I
really cherish the most.


83
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.740
What's sporty!

84
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.500
It's a wonderful part of
the world, great studios.


85
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.220
Back to us having a really
good time recording again.


86
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.260
That was amazing!

87
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.300
We've worked so hard on this
album, we come home and,


88
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.300
and we're ultimately very proud of it, we
think you know it's our best work to date.


89
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.460
So excited to let
people hear it.


90
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.740
And then COVID hits, and the whole
complexion of the world changes.


91
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.980
Like everyone else I
mean it really messed us up.


92
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.140
You know with everything
stopping and I don't think


93
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.380
there's a soul on the planet
that hasn't felt it.


94
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.500
For us timing-wise with the album
it was really awkward because


95
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.660
we literally had just announced the
album was gonna come out in like May.


96
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.116
I think it was May. But it was
like, "This isn't gonna happen."


97
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.500
It was physically impossible
to make it happen.


98
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.140
Every bit of our energy and focus
has gone into this thing that is now


99
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.020
to all intents and purposes
taken away from us.


100
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.980
I really struggled in the
aftermath of not putting it out.


101
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.660
I suddenly started to think
like, "Is music even important?"


102
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.060
Is anyone gonna want to
stand in a field again?


103
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.980
Or a venue to watch music when
we're dealing with so much shit.


104
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.580
You're off the hampster wheel and
you're not doing what it is you love to do,


105
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.260
so it was really a kind of a
bit of an existential crisis.


106
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.820
What are we doing? What am I
doing? What is life about?


107
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.140
If I don't have something
activating and engaging my brain


108
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.820
then that's when I kinda start
to go into a spiral.


109
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:40.020
I felt like I was a bike,
gaping wind in my, my mind.


110
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.820
Not to be overly dramatic, but
my soul, I just felt, I felt empty.


111
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.820
Yeah, it was a little dark and

112
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.300
had to find something
to focus on basically


113
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.020
becasue if you've got nothing
at the end of the tunnel then


114
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.020
its kinda what's the
point type thing.


115
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.500
It seems crazy to
sit here and moan about


116
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.940
that sort of thing happening
when I'm lucky enough to be


117
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.500
in this amazing band and
have this amazing life,


118
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.860
but, I mean, yeah, it's all
relative. It was hard.


119
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.780
As much as its been
really tough,


120
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.260
it's probably reinforced
who we are as a band


121
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.060
and as friends more
than ever because


122
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.900
actually when you rip
everything else away,


123
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.460
that's what we enjoy. That's
what makes us who we are.


124
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.660
But it was really hard
to rememeber that.


125
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.380
I mean life is often
about compromises.


126
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.260
When it comes down
to the choice of


127
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.380
not puttin' the record out at
all because we can't tour


128
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.620
or get the music out there,
people can enjoy it.


129
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.940
Music's about helping
you through life.


130
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.020
Everyone was stuck at
home for a year so.


131
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.900
In some ways you could say we
had a captive audience, you know?


132
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.620
Hello everybody. Thanks so much
for taking 'A Celebration of Endings'


133
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.140
to number one in the offical
album chart. Oh, yeah!


134
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.500
We miss you guys loads. We're
very proud of this record.


135
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.180
Thanks for listening.
We love you. Miss you.


136
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.260
We are Biffy Clyro and
we'll see you soon.


137
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.140
The week to the album release
we wanted to do like a performance


138
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.620
from Glasgow, you know as close as
we can get to playing together as a band


139
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.300
so that we felt some semblance
of normalcy.


140
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.940
Anyone that knows the band knows
what history we have in that room.


141
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.780
It's just an incredible place.

142
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.260
Without that show I
wouldn't even feel like


143
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.780
I necessarilly released
an album you know?


144
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.380
It's like you pull the catapult
back and you're ready,


145
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.300
but you're tensed. You're
stress there,


146
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.900
until you let go of that it
doesn't come to fruition.


147
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.100
I think we took a negative
situation and really turned it positive.


148
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.020
Just tryin' to appreciate they're
actually live stream the camera.


149
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.260
That's the fans when you're right there
when you're performing in that moment.


150
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.580
I actually feel that the badlands
show was one of the best things


151
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.620
we ever did. I say that
kind of bashfully,


152
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.140
but that is one of the
things I'm proudest of.


153
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.420
Well done everybody.

154
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.460
I started making a bunch of
music after the album came out.


155
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.900
The album came out in August
and in September I knew I needed to,


156
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.380
even though I didn't feel very
creative, I knew I needed to


157
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.500
have a sense of purpose
because it all built up


158
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.540
and then the album is out and
then it was like, what now?


159
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.140
Simon just writes all the time,
you know, he's always got songs.


160
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.260
So I think what started
this, maybe like


161
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.460
this is a kind of wee B
sides album type thing.


162
00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.460
It's now become a whole
different beast.


163
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.700
One new idea was whoa, this
is great, this is new.


164
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.060
I don't know what this is but
it's going to be a treat.


165
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.900
I know it's going to work because
the exitements there in that new


166
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.860
terrain. You've opened up a
new landscape to yourself.


167
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.300
We just had to record them, but,

168
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.980
what do you do when
you're restricted?


169
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.220
You can't travel. You
can't go anywhere.


170
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.100
I don't even know if the label knew
we were making an album at first.


171
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.140
You know, we were just
doing our own thing.


172
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.260
It really feels like you've got
a wee secret at that point.


173
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.860
A wee secret that the world
doesn't know about.


174
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.620
You've got rolling fields over here.
On a nice day like this


175
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.476
it's beautiful to come
here and look at this.


176
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.740
It's quite inspiring.
I'm sure you'll agree.


177
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.620
And hopefully we'll
bump into a farmer.


178
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.420
And you will not understand a
word these guys are sayin'.


179
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.500
This is deep Ayrshire.

180
00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.180
Fantastic. Oh, here
we go. Some friends.


181
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.700
Alright there, how
you doing? Oh, no.


182
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.580
- Bit skitish. Bit skitish today.
- Not a fan of the last album maybe.


183
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.260
No no, they don't like
the new stuff.


184
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.700
It's... They're older fans.

185
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.220
You're a biggin' You
are a biggin. Nah.


186
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.180
I'm not feeling pally
today. Almost.


187
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.820
Oh Jesus, covered in slobber.
Fuck that.


188
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.500
It's been an eye opener. I realized
how good at recording we can get.


189
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.860
You can be on a farm with an
outhouse toilet and no running water


190
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.140
and still make a great
album. That's great.


191
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.980
We are on a farm. We are
in a working farm.


192
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:45.020
It's a dairy farm. You know, we hear the
dairy trucks arrive. The cows are next door.


193
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.740
It's weird because when people
hear we were making a record here,


194
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.980
even just like family and
things, they go, "Oooo."


195
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.220
You know and that was quite
exciting for me because


196
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.940
it made me realize this is
something we haven't done.


197
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.420
We first went there 15
years ago, it was,


198
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.500
it was a very different place.

199
00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.340
We got the overalls
on and we got to DIY.


200
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.860
Grafted everyday to build
this amazing dias


201
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.740
and to create this living
room space as well


202
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.980
we could hang out in and
also make a kitchen,


203
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.620
which I tiled. My first
ever tiling job.


204
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.060
It's not any better
soundproofed than it was so


205
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.620
I think the neighbors
are still like...


206
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.660
I hope they like our music,

207
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.620
because, if they don't, then
it's been a long 15 years.


208
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.940
Adam Noble was our obvious
choice. He's a wonderful producer.


209
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.060
Adam feels a part of the
gang


210
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.500
so he doesn't need a lot of
convincing to get involved


211
00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.740
and that's something
we're so lucky with.


212
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.700
Fortunately we got a
fantastic relationship


213
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.740
and he trusts us as
a band so he knows


214
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.340
even if what we're attempting
is the most insane thing


215
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.620
everybody knows that there's purpose
to it and there's a concept behind it.


216
00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.260
It's exotic that.

217
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.420
You know, he laughs so much.
When he starts laughing really hard,


218
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.660
you know that's when you've
done the right thing.


219
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.460
Churd has been my guitar
tech for 15 or 16 years.


220
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.300
He's one of the sweetest humans you could
meet. I mean we've grown up together you know.


221
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.020
We remember Churd
when he was 21.


222
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.860
He was a classic rock
guy on tour. You know.


223
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:48.860
Churd! Churd! Churd!
Churd! Churd! Churd!


224
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.660
He's just a saint is Churd. He'll
work and work and never complain.


225
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.020
We're dear dear friends.
You know these are...


226
00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.460
If you wanna see me cry
let's keep talking


227
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.180
because these are people that we
love. We've got a strong connection.


228
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.900
We've lived our best moments
and our darkest moments together.


229
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.460
But the challenge was
definitely can we record


230
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.380
a proper record and not a low-fi
record. Not like a dusty sounding record


231
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.500
but like something that makes
everyone proud and it blows


232
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.900
even 'A Celebration of Endings'
out the water. That's part of the plan.


233
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.220
Just feel it building
up for that last one.


234
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.780
First day of recording we
spent really quite a lot of time


235
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.500
making sure we got all the
little hums and all the pops


236
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.580
that you get down the vocal
mics and things like that


237
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.820
and we're just getting
ready to do bass.


238
00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.020
I looked at the computer
and it's like duf, duf.


239
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.740
All these spikes coming from
the bass channel and we're like


240
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.940
the sessions over. What we
gotta do?


241
00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.380
A ticking noise in the audio
and it was the electric fence


242
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.020
to try and keep sheep in their
bloody pen.


243
00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.500
So we had to get the farmer to
turn off the electric fence.


244
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.900
Even though we were entering this
fight with one hand tied behind our back


245
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.660
it didn't mean we were wanting to do any
less damage. It's still a, a hell of a fist.


246
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.460
I feel very cool comin' in here
today with this sunshine.


247
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.180
I talk a good game. I try and
get it in every record.


248
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.476
It doesn't often make it, but
there's a couple of songs


249
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.060
in this that are, that have
real sound scaping moments


250
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.820
that I think I can get away
with my rudimental skills.


251
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.140
Oh yeah, I just went and made
Last of the Mohicans there.


252
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.300
First song 'Dum Dum' was
the key song on that album.


253
00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.740
The song almost whispers
its way into life.


254
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.140
It really starts so subtly.

255
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.020
It's unlike any bit of music
we've recorded before.


256
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.500
It puts you off the scent. It makes
you think the album's going to be


257
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.780
a completely different piece
than what you hear.


258
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.540
The fact that that felt alien
to what we normally do


259
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.860
actually was the first
meaningful song on this record.


260
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.420
Cool.

261
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.260
Yep.

262
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.860
Alright. Good luck Benny.

263
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.580
I think 'A Hunger In Your
Haunt' is a little more classic Biffy.


264
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.940
It's mostly
guitar based and drums.


265
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.380
It's just agro. Getiin'
in your face.


266
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.060
Brought you in. We've enticed you into our
world and now you're gonna get one of those.


267
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.700
I think that's the wake up
call we're all looking for.


268
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.180
'Hunger In Your Haunt' is about
finding that fire inside yourself


269
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.700
during a tough time to find a
reason to get up in the morning,


270
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.740
to find that purpose
and I think musically,


271
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.820
especially after 'Dum
Dum', it has that


272
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.620
straight to the point. It's
pure purpose that song.


273
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.540
Yeah, I like that.

274
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.780
Could I add an extra...
in this verse?


275
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.500
- Yeah.
- One guitar doing that,


276
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.540
I think it might be nice to just
have one more.


277
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.180
Yeah.

278
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.380
It's got some progy stabs and
Simon's screamin' his lungs out.


279
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.220
It's just a quality Biffy
track, that one for me.


280
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.300
There's some things in feel of
what we do as a 3 piece band


281
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.860
that it's like this is who
we are this identity.


282
00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.996
Well now that I've done
my bass I should probably


283
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.420
- go on to a bit of milking.
- Yeah haha!


284
00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:56.460
We're in there making a racket, making
our noise... and there's people out here


285
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.620
doing real work.

286
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.580
This is uh, David,
head of operations.


287
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.580
He writes all the songs, he
tells us what to play.


288
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.540
Oh I thought you were going to say
head of operations just in the farm.


289
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:12.420
- Oh no no no.
- When the shit hits the fan I've gotta deal with it.


290
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.460
- Yeah that's it! Uh oh.
- It doesn't stay.


291
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.300
- This is cool!
- -It's not that fucking cool!


292
00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.460
- Oh that's good! It...
- What?


293
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.060
- Oh, it swivels!
- It's got steadycam.


294
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.500
What's the story man?

295
00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.260
The story is...
glory right now


296
00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.700
'cause we are on top
of the silos tower.


297
00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.700
- Hey we're on the Simon, look at that!
- Yeah!


298
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.820
Yo yo!

299
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:46.340
- You're very high.
- Yeah I know. He's a tiny wee dot man! So far away!


300
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.780
Being here we've kind of stripped away
a lot of the extraneous things that come


301
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.700
with recording and I think
here it's much simpler.


302
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.700
There's a different feeling of
accomplishment I think because we've got


303
00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.420
our hands a little bit dirtier doing it
and there's no everyday distractions in


304
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.396
- life at the moment. So it's really nice.
- Yeah.


305
00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.540
To have this
something to focus on.


306
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.940
We can just hunker down in
our wee world here and...


307
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.700
The last few weeks being here
together, the comradery, the vibe is really


308
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.420
equal importance to the
music at this stage.


309
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.980
And I always find that when things in life
don't come that easy you appreciate them


310
00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.340
- a little bit more.
- Yeah.


311
00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:33.460
Bit of a panic you know,
running about the supermarket.


312
00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.756
Not usually the most important
thing when making an album.


313
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.300
Not usually, not for the drummer,
but, this is a different album man.


314
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.100
You know Ben took on all the
cooking with Churd for like, two months.


315
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.300
Yeah, I was jumping between drum machines
and the stove trying to make dinner.


316
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:55.860
And James is basically, he was the engineer
backing up the producer, Adam Noble.


317
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.300
If there's limitations to it
practically, we'll figure that out.


318
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.340
What fuckin fuck is
that?


319
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.340
But as long as you can come up
with the idea and have the spark


320
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.980
the feeling amongst us is that
we can make this work.


321
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:15.460
Yeah man, haha.

322
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.940
So we're gonna give you a little
run down of dinner, right Churds?


323
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.660
Nice bit of salmon, we've got a
medley of summer vegetables.


324
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.100
We're gonna eat well,
we're gonna eat well.


325
00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.060
We only started even having people in
here that weren't myself, Ben and James


326
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.380
probably two years ago because it's
such a sacred place for us and it was


327
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.180
all about keeping the vibe right.
Because that's what we cherish


328
00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.220
so much about this place
is this place is fun.


329
00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.820
This is like a kind of clubhouse
forest to make our music.


330
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.060
Oh, no!

331
00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.220
Just did the job that Ben half
did.


332
00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.260
At one time we were on holiday in
France, bizzarely watching snooker.


333
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.860
And they're all going 'Allie
McManus! Allie McManus!'


334
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:04.420
So Alan McManus is uh, is my favorite player.
Is this the 'making of the making of'?


335
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.700
This is the making of the making
of the making of... the making of.


336
00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.020
I don't actually know what's
happening anymore!


337
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:16.100
Oh fuckin hell it's the

338
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.300
Do you remember
where we got them?


339
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.780
All of them I believe have been
thrown on stage, right, there or gigs.


340
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.020
- Um there's half of Souttar. And half uh, Poland.
- Right, okay.


341
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.100
That's Scotland and
Poland together.


342
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.660
Together at
last!


343
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.260
And there we've got Portugal, and this
is amazing look at the drawing on this!


344
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.156
I have no idea how they've done
this, but the likeness is just uncanny.


345
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:41.420
- It's pretty hot.
- It's pretty hot, just three bored dudes.


346
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:46.420
I mean we've been having a bit of a laugh but
genuinely it is so nice to have the support.


347
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.460
- To have the memories of these people. You know?
- Yeah.


348
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.980
As much as we felt isolated last year
as everyone did, putting these things up


349
00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.876
and the nice messages we've got from all
over the world really helped us be like,


350
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.740
"You know there's people
out there that care."


351
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.300
I pour a lot of myself, my
vulnerabilities into the songs


352
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.500
which at a point can take its
toll. But seeing


353
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.100
people listen to your music in
the right way I feel very lucky


354
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:18.300
that the people that dig our band really
care about the music the same way that we do.


355
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.140
Would that work in
the chorus?


356
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.580
Yeah, let me try that in the
chorus absolutely!


357
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.620
Satisfaction even in your
darkest moment writing a really


358
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.140
sad song can still end up
bringing you joy.


359
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.980
There's like a full circle that happens in
that and that's why I keep making music.


360
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.380
Yes, nice one ain't it.

361
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.620
- Aya! Little motherfuckin prick!
- Ah yeah that sounded good.


362
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.300
- So delicate!
- Aaaargh! Yeah!


363
00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.100
Here we are!

364
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.900
- This is so peaceful man!
- Nice innit?


365
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.500
I kind of want to take a trip
up to that farm sometime.


366
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.500
Don't know what they
do up there.


367
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.740
- Have we been?
- I wanna know what rock band's up there.


368
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.700
I think we get the best of both
worlds with the travelling that we do.


369
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.420
And then we have the
grounding... of home.


370
00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.020
And the attitude of the people at
home I think that's really important


371
00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.940
to your... mental wellbeing.

372
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:27.700
I think 'cause we're in a job where people
often celebrate your success it's nice


373
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.580
to come to a place where no-one
really gives a shit.


374
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.100
And that suits us just fine.

375
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.620
You can't go wrong with that eh?

376
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.420
We've been pretty much
everywhere in the world.


377
00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.820
And that's helped get me, contextualize
why this place is important to me.


378
00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.420
And why it's really important
to our band.


379
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.900
This is the longest we've been
home since we were actually


380
00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.100
kids 'cause we've been touring
since.


381
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.100
As you get older you do have this
appreciation for where you come from


382
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.780
and how it has affected you as a
person. How it's made you who you are.


383
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.940
The more we've travelled over the
years, the connection becomes stronger.


384
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.580
The more time you spend away,
the Scottishness is deep within us.


385
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.100
I wouldn't be comfortable being
so vulnerable in my songs or...


386
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.940
or kind of defenseless if they didn't
come from this part of the world.


387
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.940
We've come back home. We've
come back home to glorious Kilmarnock.


388
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.796
- Kind of where it all started for us really.
- Yeah.


389
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.460
- In the garage.
- In the garage.


390
00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.780
- The parents' garage.
- Tight 8PM cutoff.


391
00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.540
Yeah, if it got to 8:01,
the door got shut.


392
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.940
- Can't go over.
- Stop, that's it, 8:01.


393
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.820
And these other neighbors
that hate us.


394
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.260
Persona non grata right here!

395
00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.100
Watch your head tall man!

396
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.980
Amps everywhere! It was
like, one in one out.


397
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.060
- A bit of a clusterfuck.
- It really was.


398
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.020
- To play some over the years. Biffy gigs. Oh my god.
- Wow.


399
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.300
- There's a really old one from the paper.
- Oh when we played the...


400
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:59.100
So that's us playing a battle
of bands. It's gone yellow.


401
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.340
We didn't have very many
plans but we did take it seriously.


402
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.740
Practice was about
getting better.


403
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.060
Just that feeling when you all come
together and you just make that beautiful


404
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.860
harmony, you make that noise.
There's just nothing really like it.


405
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.260
You filming aye?

406
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.100
How we doin?
Welcome to Kilmarnock!


407
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.300
There's star walks further
down town.


408
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:28.620
Where they have all the famous
people. It goes on for miles.


409
00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.140
A handsome man!

410
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.740
- Fuckin shivers.
- I know haha!


411
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.660
A couple of venues in this square half mile
that we played loads when we were younger.


412
00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.036
Typical you know like that's-like you
find the couple of pubs nearby that let you


413
00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.620
- in underage with your fake ID.
- Yeah.


414
00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.220
Basically it was whoever had
sideburns


415
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.580
would be the first
one walkin up like,


416
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.940
"Hey man I've got sideburns I'm quite
obviously legal!" and then they'd be like,


417
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.060
- "Alright, in ya come."
- Yeah.


418
00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.660
But it's just about getting your
pals down to watch the show.


419
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.340
It's just about playing music with your
friends and we've never taken it for granted.


420
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.781
And I think if your roots are
different than ours are then


421
00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.740
maybe you would take some
things for granted.


422
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.460
Taa daaa!

423
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.676
- Is that what you were expecting?
- -Is that not gorgeous?


424
00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.220
Is that not gorgeous?

425
00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.860
This is BIFFY CLYRO.

426
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.940
So this is the venue that
one of our very first shows...


427
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.100
So I broke a string, it was
literally like SOS sorry everyone.


428
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.460
Just need to drive home to get a
spare string, so that's what we did.


429
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.860
There was a 15 minute delay
in the gig. "We're gonna take


430
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.580
"a 5 minute break for 10
minutes. See you in 15!" That was...


431
00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.540
Flung that out there and I'll never
forget that. What a line! It's not my line.


432
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.876
And then yeah we went out and
literally I changed the guitar string


433
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.196
- in front of the whole crowd and then we carried on.
- And that's that.


434
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.420
But you know that's the spirit of things
when you start as a proper DIY band.


435
00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.940
You know like, get in a van, make your own
gigs happen. Print your own flyers and shit.


436
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.780
- That's what happens.
- Yup. - Absolutely.


437
00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.140
You don't want things to come
too easy to you you know?


438
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.420
Oh it would've been nice though!

439
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.260
I mean it was terrifying.
I remember being so scared.


440
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.540
So rigid and not moving. Like
that not even breaking a sweat.


441
00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.380
But hooked, absolutely hooked, it
was just the most amazing feeling.


442
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.460
We just kept going.
More often than not we were unpopular.


443
00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.260
People asking for Oasis people asking
for... anything but what we were doing.


444
00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:22.620
We didn't change! We did not change, we just
put our hoods up and turned and faced the back.


445
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.300
I don't know it it was
just arrogance or confidence.


446
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.860
Or whether it was
self preservation.


447
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.116
You know like, hey, we're not gonna engage
so therefore if people aren't into it


448
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.340
then we can... well we didn't
want you to like our band!


449
00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.220
And that was kind of
our badge of honor.


450
00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.860
And here we are approaching
what used to be...


451
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.460
- Arlington Birdies. - Right here?
- Yeah, yeah that's it.


452
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.980
It's super gone!

453
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.180
But this is where we played, I
think it was on the 3rd set of the night.


454
00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.180
- It was your birthday though?
- It was our birthday, our 18th birthday.


455
00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.396
And the owner came over said, "You guys
better turn this down it's getting too loud!"


456
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.180
And Simon being the young
defiant man that he was like,


457
00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:07.540
"Yeah, very good!" Duh nuh nuh!
Turned it up.


458
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.436
- And uh, I think there were a few choice words.
- I'll never forget it,


459
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.020
"Do not make a cunt of me young
man."


460
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.740
Which in essence is making a cunt of
yourself, saying that to an 18 year old child.


461
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.660
- You paid 60 quid to hire out-I know!
- Exactly!


462
00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.500
"Do you want your 60 quid or
not?!"


463
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.180
It's nice to be able to honor
these places which have allowed us


464
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.860
to then make our ridiculous
new album.


465
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.580
You know like 2 miles that
way, it's fuckin' brilliant!


466
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.380
You know with that it's like,
you couldn't make that up.


467
00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.620
In terms of where we're from being
a part of who we are, it's undeniable.


468
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.380
Probably a slight chip
on our shoulder.


469
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.620
Probably a slight underdog
mentality.


470
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.140
Lookin back I'm so glad that myself
Ben and James kind of stood alone


471
00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.620
in our small towns because...

472
00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.940
It gave us a strength and this
identity and this gang mentality


473
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.820
that we wouldn't have
had otherwise.


474
00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:06.620
Quite a big lable actually came up
to see us play and after the showcase


475
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.780
he kind of said the deal hinged
on us changing the name.


476
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.780
And so we were like "nope."

477
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.420
Even if it means you
think we're going to fail.


478
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:20.540
That's out choice to make. And
if we do fail, we'll go down fightin'.


479
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.220
So we kinda turned down this record
deal to keep the name BIFFY CLYRO.


480
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.660
Oh god that sounds so
stupid. It's true.


481
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.980
No, sticking to your
guns is a good thing.


482
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.500
And trying to see your vision
out, and that's what we did.


483
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:40.060
We kept the silly name and it's
haunted us ever since.


484
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.540
This is fun stuff!

485
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.900
Listen to this, we're making music
and we're breaking music today.


486
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:59.940
Recent BIFFY records electronics
play a much bigger part you know.


487
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.460
For years I would just put loads of
guitars on the record and actually


488
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:07.220
sometimes I find that putting a weird
electronic sound or something can actually


489
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:12.060
make a song heavier. It can just take
your mind somewhere else dynamically.


490
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.220
It's really opened up the sonics
of where the songs end up.


491
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.740
I think that's just what
it needs, I swear!


492
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.180
It's always gonna have the
identity of who we are.


493
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.300
I think as soon as Ben plays drums,
James plays bass and I sing on it you know,


494
00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.356
then it's gonna sound like our band.
But we wanna kind of present it in like


495
00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.820
almost a different part of the world
each time. Like a different geography.


496
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.500
Terrain's probably the best way
to do it, a different terrain.


497
00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.060
Yeah, you'll hear some funny
sounds on this record, that's for sure.


498
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.460
We can do that!

499
00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.980
There's a real vibe to it you know there's
something about this. It's kind of quite cocky.


500
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.020
Or gallus as we'd
say in Scotland.


501
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.940
It just immediately makes you
feel a bit seasick, that song.


502
00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:44.140
I just love it. I love the feeling
of, "Woah, I feel a bit woozy here."


503
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.380
I think this song just feels
beautifully woozy.


504
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.940
Trying to get that balance of something
that's really quite oppressively dark


505
00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.500
the thought behind that humans
are errors in the history of God.


506
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.500
We often do that when the songs have the darkest
lyrics, the actual melodies are quite light.


507
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.860
That's an important part of what we do I
think is that Yin and Yang and really kind of


508
00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.100
make people go "oh that's an
upbeat song" oh no it's actually not


509
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.220
it's really dark or vice
versa you know I love it.


510
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.100
It took me longer to miss the gigs
than I thought it would during lockdown.


511
00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.580
We tour, we play well over

512
00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:57.020
so sometimes the last thing you
wanna do is go to a venue.


513
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.700
But when you do go to a venue
and those lights go down before


514
00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.660
the band comes on that's what I
live for.


515
00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:05.260
And I try and remember that
when we're prepping for a gig.


516
00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.620
That moment of "this is about
to happen" that's the magic.


517
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.756
"What's tonight gonna hold?" You
know and the band has that as well I think.


518
00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.980
Even as a fan when you're
there you do wonder...


519
00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:28.660
"How good's this gonna be?" But
your excitement level soars.


520
00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.116
And that's how I feel when we're
about to play it's like you wanna


521
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.420
reach the stars
you wanna reach the sky.


522
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.700
But the bands I like, and the music
that we make, I just want people to care.


523
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.460
Being one person's favorite band as
opposed to 10 peoples' fifth favorite band.


524
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.700
That was the mantra early on.

525
00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.180
We were just young kids
we were in hoodies and just


526
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.620
playing some really abrasive
music. Just wanted to make a racket.


527
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.700
And ruffle some feathers
I guess.


528
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.420
We're now at James' house.
We're gonna show you a version of the van


529
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.940
we used to tour in back in the day.
For like 5 or 6 years James and Ben


530
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.060
used to drive us around
in a camper van.


531
00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.580
James bought like a replica of
it, but this is rock and roll.


532
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.060
If you can spend four weeks in
a van with your two best friends


533
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.060
and have the time of your life
stay in that band! Stay in that van!


534
00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.060
And keep fucking doing it!

535
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.140
- Back to early 2000's over here with this bad boy!
- I know!


536
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.316
- How are ya man? Feeling alright?
- How ya doin? Yeah,


537
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.276
- feeling alright thanks man.
- Good to see you man.


538
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.340
- Is it weird? Is it nice being in there?
- It is nice.


539
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.460
- Hey if we tour this van would be alright!
- Ha, I know!


540
00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.740
Cup of tea sir?

541
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.060
Hey, cup of coffee sir?

542
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.860
I still don't know where all the
people went and all the gear went.


543
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.060
I guess we were a little
bit smaller then?


544
00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.700
For us it was always like having
a great time in the moment.


545
00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.660
'Cause it just felt like we were a gang from
this part of the world exploring the UK.


546
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.700
Turning up, 3 normal folk, and we'd go in
and try to make as big of a fuckin' impact


547
00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.420
and splash as possible, and there's such
an innocence and a purity to that I think.


548
00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.556
- And I don't think we've ever lost that.
- If it came down to


549
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.596
it now, and we had to get
into the van, the three of us


550
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.700
and bunch of gear I would... I'd
carry the gear,


551
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.220
and I know the boys feel the
same way and it's a really nice


552
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.596
- place to be.
- We'll be happy for James to carry the gear.


553
00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.620
Definitely be alright with
James carrying the gear.


554
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.180
They're the moments when you realize if
you really wanna be doing what you're doing


555
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.860
- and you're surrounded by people you like, because.
- Yeah.


556
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.900
If it means spending 20
hours in a van


557
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.716
- to play that show we'll fuckin do it.
- Absolutely.


558
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.140
And if it's not worth it to you
then


559
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.780
hang up your guitar or
your laptop


560
00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.460
or your fuckin USB key.

561
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.780
Or log out of fuckin' tech talk.

562
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.060
It's a reminder to
keep things kind of simple.


563
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.060
Because it's not much different
to what we were doing then to now.


564
00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.340
It's still getting together to
play music in front of strangers.


565
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.820
You're with your best mate and
your brother and you're kicking ass.


566
00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.500
Your in the country
and scaring folk.


567
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:55.500
Thank you.

568
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.420
In early tours we didn't
always play with our shirts off.


569
00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:02.100
Now after each show, you did
maybe 29 shows in 30 days, so our-


570
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.436
we would just fling our gig
shows out the back of the van


571
00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.860
and literally after like a week
we had like a chewing gum...


572
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:12.820
Massive chewing gum ball of t-shirts that
were just salty and horrible discolored.


573
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.276
- It's your favorite t-shirt as well 'cause you've been onstage.
- You think.


574
00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.516
- "I'm wearing my cool t-shirt!"
- Yeah, I wear my cool t-shirt and then


575
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.796
- you go home and you've got no bloody clothes left.
- So that's why


576
00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.060
- we started...
- We started playing with our shirts off.


577
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:26.500
It's a bit ridiculous going on stage
in front of 10,000 people anyway.


578
00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.460
And I think stripping away any kind
of armor that you use in everyday life


579
00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:34.060
is, it's just you're totally free,
you've got nothing else to hide behind.


580
00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.620
- It's just you and your fucking mind and your brothers.
- Yeah.


581
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.460
And we've ended up playing some
sh-we've played gigs in the Arctic Circle.


582
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.900
Up in northern Norway,
up in Tromso√ł.


583
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.900
It was minus four degrees and we were
like, "Why did we decide to do this again?"


584
00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.940
But see once you start playing it doesn't
fuckin matter so you get in that headspace.


585
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.876
But there has been a few times where we've
been like "This is a really bad idea."


586
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.020
Just a terrible one.

587
00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.340
Basically we're on the road

588
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.076
and you're going off the road like
"this is not too bad" and then suddenly.


589
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.900
Oh my God!

590
00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.556
- And then at the end you're like "turn turn turn!"
- Turn! Turn!


591
00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.156
- And you fly off like Fast and the Furious and land like...
- Boom.


592
00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.780
- Back on.
- Land on in the back of the plane!


593
00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.516
- Exactly! You've seen the movie I'm talking about!
- Like "woah!"


594
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.100
And they just land!

595
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:33.060
Yeah!

596
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.620
Yeah okay.

597
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:08.660
Yeah that makes sense but
without the yeah.


598
00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.140
Yeah!

599
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.020
Great. Well done.

600
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.660
Alright.

601
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.060
I really wanted to have a
big long intro and I thought...


602
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.020
'Separate Missions'? This
is the song for it.


603
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.060
It's another flavor
for the band.


604
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.540
The Cure were a band that
we all referenced.


605
00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.940
They just start and they motor along or
gallop and they're setting a scene for ages.


606
00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.460
This one's a lot closer lyrically to
what 'Celebration of Endings' was about.


607
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.820
Ironically even though the music
is all new it's kind of about those


608
00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.380
deteriorating relationships
and how we've ended up


609
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.380
on separate paths and
separate missions.


610
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:21.780
We just sit on a groove for ages
and it's kind of keyboard driven as well.


611
00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.500
We just sit on this
beautiful riff.


612
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.580
I love the sound of this, I think
it's such a new sound for the band.


613
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.620
When you're in the studio it's
like for a week you'll be like


614
00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.156
"this isn't workin this isn't workin!"
and then you make one change


615
00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.420
and you're like "it's
workin!"


616
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.476
And that's the beautiy of music 'cause
I was so excited with the whole song


617
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.180
and then this bridge
sucks and I'm like.


618
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.740
You're like "no it can be perfect it can be
perfect" and then it just happens one day.


619
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.820
"That's it! It was always
meant to be like that!"


620
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.860
We're still trying to peel back the layers
of the onion and find some new fruit.


621
00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.820
Just-don't wanna talk about
it. Don't wanna talk about it.


622
00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.540
All these golden, double gold
record and platinum-like honestly


623
00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.380
just not talk about that.

624
00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.380
- It's a musical reflection-
-It's an eagle room!


625
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.220
It's an eagle room, let's... It's
an eagle room! It's an eagle room!


626
00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.836
Yeah I mean that's what I've
been calling it is the eagle room


627
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.620
and that's why the
blinds stay down.


628
00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.420
Just displaying them all in a...
It's just a bit of a hangup.


629
00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.356
- And they end up stuck in a cupboard.
- The sheer amount of


630
00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.220
them isn't it? That's why.

631
00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.380
It's almost like it's a nice
memory run


632
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.500
to go "look at how
amazing we are!"


633
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.820
It's almost like motivation
to move forward.


634
00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.900
And we take great pride in the
art that we choose you know.


635
00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:01.660
And for us it always has to just
be-harmonize with the music inside.


636
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:05.220
If there is no correlation then
you're missing a trick.


637
00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:09.740
Artwork should be not even an
extension of it, it should be part of it.


638
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.420
Songs are always about
a time and a place.


639
00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.460
You know, mentally what you're
going through, what we're going through.


640
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:19.700
And I think that's why it's important
that you join those thoughts up.


641
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.940
That's a picture from our old practice
room, and the 3 fuckin gumballs right there.


642
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.220
- They were the pictures we approved.
- I know! Third album!


643
00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.180
There were 6,000 limited
edition copies of this.


644
00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.780
So I decided like a pure fool.

645
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.820
That I was gonna personally write
a line of lyrics for every single one.


646
00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:41.100
So I wrote 6,000 lines of lyrics
while making this record and it was...


647
00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.260
It was a pleasure to do.

648
00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.700
For the first 10 years
of being in this band


649
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.420
I didn't really appreciate that
the voice was a muscle.


650
00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.100
You know when I was in
my teens and early 20s,


651
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.900
my voice would recover
like that you know.


652
00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.100
I could scream myself all
night, wake up the next day


653
00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.740
and sing like an angel still,
or my version of an angel.


654
00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.300
Mentally, it helps
me get in the mode.


655
00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:27.220
This is part of my process
now. It helps me gear up,


656
00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.020
helps my adrenaline start to
pump and my blood kinda flows


657
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.780
in the right way to my throat.

658
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.540
This is my ideal if I could do
my vocal warmup like this


659
00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.660
every single day I would be as
happy as a pig in shit.


660
00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.620
I think I was on LSD
state of mind man.


661
00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:49.340
The slow-mo chorus and here
messing like this is a good chorus.


662
00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.500
Let me, let me do
that last line.


663
00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.300
Yep. Yep. Let me do that
last line brother.


664
00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:31.380
Yeah.

665
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.460
Thanks. Good.

666
00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.260
This album is like defined by
the fact that we made it in a farm


667
00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.980
you know and it's sonically,
you can hear the farm.


668
00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.660
Clear that the big fucking bit.

669
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.980
I just went 'round the farm smashing things
with sticks and sampling cows making noises.


670
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.220
What do you do with
the drum sticks?


671
00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.380
Yeah!

672
00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.700
And then I take all the samples back, put
them into our drum machine and make a loop.


673
00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.540
I think that'll be good.
We'll make it a subscription


674
00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.820
service so you get new farm
sounds every month.


675
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.500
Fucking brilliant.

676
00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.180
I think being as well,
you can spend a day


677
00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.460
experimenting and it maybe
doesn't lead somewhere


678
00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:43.700
but you don't feel that you've
lost a day just quite so much.


679
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.860
That's why I say when people start a
band, it's so important that you get on


680
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.100
because technical proficiency
you can make up for


681
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.980
but you can't learn
to always get on


682
00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.980
and you can't learn to have
fun. That's a chemistry thing.


683
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.420
That is some of the best music
we have ever fucking made.


684
00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.700
Today we're getting our
traditional album band tattoos,


685
00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.860
which we've been gettin' since

686
00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:19.380
2001 I think was the first time we got
one. This guy here. Hands on the wheel.


687
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:24.140
And we've been getting tattoos
pretty much every album ever since.


688
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.300
I kind to think of it as you know
people get tattoos of loved ones


689
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.180
names on them. I guess
that's to signify that


690
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.420
you're going to love them until
the end of your life.


691
00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.380
That's how important
this band is to us.


692
00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:44.020
- Yo yo. How we doing? Good, good.
- Good.


693
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.260
These paperclips are from an
artist called Richard McGuire.


694
00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:50.580
I just love this because it kinda
describes myself, Ben and James.


695
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.540
These are paperclips keepin'
everything together


696
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.900
and, yeah, this long
as being a band


697
00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.820
I think it's important to celebrate the
fact that we do keep things together.


698
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.180
Yeah. Sure.

699
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.220
Who's next? Who's brave?

700
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.340
Okay.

701
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.780
That was really quick.

702
00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.740
It's always a realyl nice
way to comemerate


703
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.220
such an important
part of our lives.


704
00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.460
Just to have it there forever.
There's just no better feeling.


705
00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.660
One. Two. One, two, three, four.

706
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:43.060
Brings me joy. It brings me joy
as soon as I hear that song start.


707
00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.580
Witch's Cup is almost
like a showtune or


708
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.580
somethin' from a
movie soundtrack.


709
00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.500
I still can't put my
finger on what it is.


710
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.500
This is like a crazy
carnival song. It really is.


711
00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.820
It's like you've taken
acid at a carnival,


712
00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.780
but it's mixed with a lullaby.

713
00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:09.676
That's the thing. It also
sounds a bit like a lullaby,


714
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.300
which I think is beautiful.

715
00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:19.260
Shows the genius of Simon because to write a
lullaby is a fucking difficult thing to do.


716
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.460
It makes me feel good
to hear it and play it


717
00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.860
and I don't know if I would've
been brave enough


718
00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.700
to work in this song again if I was
thinking about how we would present it live.


719
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.260
One of the songs where if we
could've we would have had a massive


720
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:51.700
brass band but we ended up
having to sort of do synth brass,


721
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.580
but musically it does
make you feel good.


722
00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.796
We journey through this big great day
where the song completely changes again


723
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.900
and the rocks pool and
is this the same song?


724
00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.460
Not necissarily a lot of Biffy
songs make me wanna smile


725
00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:39.580
and that one does, so I hope it does
for people when they listen to it too.


726
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:51.220
- Do gangs. We're doing... - Gangalang.
- The baddest gang in town.


727
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:54.100
We're near the end of the
record and we start ganging.


728
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:58.460
- Ganging style.
- Wish you were here. Sort of wish you were here isn't it.


729
00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.340
Wish we had a bigger gang.

730
00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.940
I wish we had a smaller gang.

731
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.660
I think ben and I being twins,

732
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:21.780
we have to in some ways extend
the same courtesy to Simon.


733
00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:23.780
It has to be a brotherhood.
The three of us.


734
00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.956
I've known the boys from when
they were 7 and they're twins


735
00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.036
so we're almost like a 2 piece
in that regaurd because


736
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.460
Ben and James and are so close.

737
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:36.300
Being twins in the band
has kind of forced


738
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.220
us and Simon to get
closer as well.


739
00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:40.740
I think it would be weird if
you had such a tight connection


740
00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.380
between just 2 and there's 1
person who's not involved in that.


741
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.940
We've been through our toughest
moments in life together.


742
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.140
There's just no doubt about it.
The things happened in the past


743
00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.780
we never ran away from. You know,
we never ran away from each other.


744
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:09.020
- Get in here boys.
- Get down!


745
00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.380
- We're nearly there.
- Last couple days getting these vocals.


746
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:16.420
The cherry on top of the ice
cream on top.


747
00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.980
This is the shit on
top of the cherry.


748
00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.500
If you don't like each other, respect each
other, that ain't going to last, you know.


749
00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.180
Everyone should join a band. See if
you get a chance to go and join a band


750
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.140
with your brothers
or your sisters.


751
00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.900
People who you consider to
be a brother or a sister.


752
00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.580
That's probably the best years
you'll ever have in your life.


753
00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.220
Denier, yeah this song actually
started as a bit of a


754
00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.100
folk song. It was a bit
of an acoustic song.


755
00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.820
And then Si he was like,
right,


756
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.460
let's rip up the notebook on
this one. Let's change this song


757
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.900
and it's just become this
fucking juggernaut.


758
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:55.060
Ben's drumming on it is, it's
so dynamite. It's so relentless.


759
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.500
It's a hell of a lot
of fun to play.


760
00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.540
I can't wait to get that
one on the stage.


761
00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.220
It's going to be
a great one live.


762
00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:21.580
Watchign Ben like and animal
and watchign Simon singing


763
00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.980
I'm like they're
my fucking boys.


764
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:43.100
It's like a slab of guitars and
keyboards and bass and drums.


765
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.660
It's probably the least subtle
song on the record.


766
00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.580
You don't get this
at a normal studio.


767
00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:33.540
Fucking delivery blocked
the way in.


768
00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:47.260
Two can play that game Jack. Final
day. Turning the cameras on you.


769
00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.500
Are you feeling positive?
Feeling good?


770
00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:53.740
It's always weird. It's a
weird sensation, um, happy


771
00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:57.300
that we're almost there. I'm
terrified that we're almost there.


772
00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:01.060
There's always a big
gaping chasm, chasm


773
00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:05.300
in my life once we finish a record,
so I'm anticipating that a little bit.


774
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.380
But I'm really proud
of what we've made.


775
00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:10.580
You know, I think, I don't think
any other place in the world


776
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.500
at any other time in our lives
we couldn't have made this record


777
00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.876
so it feels very much now and I
just can't wait for everybody


778
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.140
to hear it but yeah
I'm fucking charred.


779
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.300
Ready for a week off
mother fucker.


780
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.540
Hey. Hi!

781
00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:27.860
Roads were busy. Everybody in
the world is out of the house.


782
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:31.860
Enjoying the sunshine.
What a day! What a day!


783
00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:35.660
It's become as important as 'A
Celebration of Endings',


784
00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:38.620
but yet couldn't have existed
without 'A Celebration of Endings'.


785
00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:40.580
To be making that
record at home,


786
00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.060
one of the best times we've
ever had as a band.


787
00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.980
I feel slightly tearful
even thinking about it.


788
00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:48.100
I think being forced
to stay at home


789
00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.700
gave us this kind of
new love for it.


790
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.540
It's a beautiful thing.

791
00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:57.100
The three of us in
this dairy farm.


792
00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:00.660
It's remarkable that we've made
this record in these circumstances.


793
00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:04.060
I'm just, I'm really
full of pride.


794
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:25.700
Yeah, that's dynamite!

795
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:28.196
If I bring in a tune and the
boys smile or the boys love it,


796
00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.740
that's where my joy
comes from you know.


797
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:33.380
It comes from us creating
things together.


798
00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.260
We don't need all the
bells and whistles


799
00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:37.420
for us to be fullfilled
and happy.


800
00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.220
We just have to be making music
together and have that vibe in a room


801
00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.500
and that's what keeps
our hearts beating.


802
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.420
It was litrally making music for

803
00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.780
for the sake of making
music cause we love it.


804
00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.860
It really felt pure. It felt
like we were kids again.


805
00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.820
Ba ba ba bom.

806
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.580
Barbecue in the Scottish
sun.


807
00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:09.980
Just the right amount of great and
just a lovely way to end a record.


808
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.876
It's Ben and James' birthday
in a couple of days


809
00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:13.900
so I got them a couple
of cool presents.


810
00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.540
Finally we can celebrate.

811
00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.900
- Big boys.
- Oh my God.


812
00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:30.860
Yo!

813
00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:39.180
Make a wish!

814
00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:42.620
- Yeah!
- Hip hip, hurray!


815
00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.860
Hip hip, hurray!
Hip hip, hurray!


816
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:49.220
- Get in folks. Step back.
- Woah!


817
00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:52.300
- I gotta clean something!
- That is so beautiful!


818
00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.460
- Woah!
- Look at that!


819
00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:57.140
- Oh Simon, thanks so much. A work of art man.
- Pleasure!


820
00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.700
Fucking brilliant!

821
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.900
- Thanks so much for...
- Happy birthday boys.


822
00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:07.340
- Well done. Well done.
- Cheers! Cheers!


823
00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:25.700
Everything we normally do points
towards a live show you know.


824
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:28.900
One satisfying aspect is always
when I first hear the songs


825
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:32.940
come together like wow I still can't believe
it when I hear things happen like wow!


826
00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.620
The conclusion of that is
when we play on the stage.


827
00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:41.780
Just about the most important,
the highest moment you get.


828
00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:45.820
The most out of body experience
you feel you're elevating.


829
00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.340
Not much else in life can
get you to that place.


830
00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:54.220
Ther'es certainly no better place
than Glasgow to be getting back at it.


831
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.860
So many lovely memories from
playing there before.


832
00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:02.340
Even as kids kinda kickin' about because
the love is real and it's going to be loud.


833
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.420
I just can't wait. I
cannot wait for that.


834
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.700
I believe it's going to
be the first show in Glasgow.


835
01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:27.060
The first outdoor show, so it
feels like quite a lot of responsibility.


836
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.980
We're less than 20 minutes away
from where we'll play to 35,000 people.


837
01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.820
This is where we made our new
record, 10 miles away.


838
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.820
It's where we live, where we grew
up, there's something really beautiful


839
01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:40.540
in this moment in time. It's such a
questioning period of time for everyone.


840
01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.020
It's happening in our
part of the world.


841
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:46.676
It's not just going to be emotional for
us, but for the fans as well you know


842
01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.620
that everyone's been cooped up.
Just to get to put a smile on their faces


843
01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.460
is going to mean
the world to us.


844
01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:04.820
I can't wait to feel
that sense of joy


845
01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.700
and that sense of we're back. You
know we've made it back here together.


846
01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.420
It's gonna be a seminal
moment.


847
01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:14.860
It's a whole rebirth.
It's starting again.


848
01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.380
I hope we can do it.

849
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.540
We can power the country
for a year off that one night


850
01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:23.780
casue there's going to be a lot of
energy. I really can't wait to feel it.


851
01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.140
I'm already nervous
thinking about it.


852
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.340
Without a doubt there's going
to be a lot of nerves.


853
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:32.260
I'll be lucky to have steady legs.
I think I'll be like Bambi on ice.


854
01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.780
Taking my nerves, my
anxiety and try to put it into


855
01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.740
the purpose and the power and
the passion of the show, you know.


856
01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.180
Just try not to brakedown
in the first 5 minutes.


857
01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.540
Just could be floods of emotion.

858
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.180
Yeah, I love you boy.

859
01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:49.220
It will be super emotional
when we finally get on a stage.


860
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.780
We've missed it so much.

861
01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.420
That'll be the moment where it
could go one of two ways.


862
01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.460
It'll either be really emotional

863
01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.260
or it will be like let's go.

864
01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.956
We never had these massive
ambitions when we started out at all.


865
01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.700
We were just this weird rock
band tryin' to piss people off.


866
01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.940
There's a weird look Simon will
give me sometimes that says all that.


867
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:36.100
Just one look that says, "Yeah, we're
doing this. This is actually happening."


868
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:41.380
You just about made me
cry because I guess


869
01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:47.140
it's everything. It's everything in our
life. It's everything that we focused on.


870
01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:51.020
Everything else in your life
feels like its got to fit around this.


871
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.300
It feels like it has
kinda come full circle.


872
01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.620
Its a shame it takes something
so dramatic and tramatic


873
01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.100
for it to happen but
I'm really pleased


874
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.980
that we are reconnecting
with where we started.


875
01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.380
So much has changed, but
yet so much hasn't.


876
01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.860
It's still just us in a room
tryin' to make each other deaf.


877
01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.060
This only further hit home
how much we fucking love


878
01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:32.060
and need to do what we do.

879
01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.900
It couldn't mean more.
Is that a good way to put it?


880
01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.620
It couldn't mean more to me.

881
01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.860
In the same part the world is our home
our very first song as we were making


882
01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.140
this record and there's
something really pure about that


883
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:04.220
and you know what, we're having
as much fun as we ever have.


884
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:06.420
I think we're better than
we ever have been so


885
01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.180
long may it continue Jack.

886
01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:14.540
We are Biffy fucking Clyro!!
