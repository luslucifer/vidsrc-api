A wake?

Yeah. Dallas.
He's not dead?


46
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:48.858
You told
him he was dead?


47
00:03:51.796 --> 00:03:53.397
We were gonna invite you,
but we got...


48
00:03:53.398 --> 00:03:56.966
But we had a fucking couple
of drinks, and we were like,


49
00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:58.835
"he's got the girl and the job,

50
00:03:58.836 --> 00:04:02.972
and he's not gonna come unless
we really get his attention."


51
00:04:02.973 --> 00:04:05.909
Okay, if he's not dead,
then where is he?


52
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.613
He fucking bailed on us, man.
He took the kid.


53
00:04:09.614 --> 00:04:11.782
Started a new show overseas.

54
00:04:13.017 --> 00:04:14.718
Wow.
Where?


55
00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.420
Macaw.

Some D-Bag investor offered
Dallas a whole bunch of money...


59
00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.562
Don't say his name, man.
Don't give it that power.


60
00:04:25.563 --> 00:04:28.665
I can say his name.
He's not fucking Voldemort.


61
00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.900
Fuckin' first time
you backflipped off that balcony


62
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:32.736
in the middle of the night.

63
00:04:32.737 --> 00:04:34.938
I was thinking about doing
it again and then punked out.


64
00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.006
Here she is.
Yeah, liquid acid, man.


65
00:04:37.007 --> 00:04:39.208
That'll take you back
to the original self.


66
00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:40.577
No, fuck that shit, man.

67
00:04:40.578 --> 00:04:42.378
I woke up under a car
in the parking lot.


68
00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:43.980
White shadow, meet Mikey.
Hi.


69
00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:46.583
Mikey Lane, white shadow.
Yeah. We've met.


70
00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:48.918
Oh, I think she likes you, Mike.
All right.


71
00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.320
Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, yeah,
she definitely likes you.


72
00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:54.991
Jesus fuck.

73
00:04:54.992 --> 00:04:57.861
You look good, Mike.
How's everything going, man?


74
00:04:57.862 --> 00:04:59.362
Things are good, man.

75
00:04:59.363 --> 00:05:01.498
They're really good.
The business is crushing it.


76
00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:04.601
We got so many orders, I don't
even have enough employees.


77
00:05:04.602 --> 00:05:06.002
Uh, I don't know.

78
00:05:06.003 --> 00:05:07.804
We're about to expand
and get a retail spot.


79
00:05:07.805 --> 00:05:10.406
That's nice, man.
Yeah. Dude, I'm just...


80
00:05:10.407 --> 00:05:12.976
I'm just happy to be running
my own show for once.


81
00:05:12.977 --> 00:05:13.844
I feel that one.

82
00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:15.244
How's the old girl?

83
00:05:15.245 --> 00:05:16.846
She's good, man.
Yeah.


84
00:05:16.847 --> 00:05:18.748
Yeah?
Yeah, I mean...


85
00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:20.784
You guys...
You still haven't told me


86
00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:22.919
what the fuck y'all are doing
in Tampa.


87
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.490
Today, you are looking at it,
brother.


88
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:28.992
Just basking in the glory
of our good fortune.


89
00:05:28.993 --> 00:05:31.595
But tomorrow we start
the pilgrimage to myrtle beach


90
00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:32.796
for the convention.
That's right.


91
00:05:32.797 --> 00:05:35.799
One last fucking ride, baby.

92
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.601
How's that work without Dallas?

93
00:05:37.602 --> 00:05:42.639
Well, you see, we, uh...
Tobias is gonna M.C.


94
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.809
All right, all right, all right!

95
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.544
How y'all ladies doing here
tonight?


96
00:05:49.914 --> 00:05:51.681
That's totally gonna work.

97
00:05:51.682 --> 00:05:53.016
Just do it just like that.

98
00:05:53.017 --> 00:05:55.519
We got a couple days
to perfect that.


99
00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.920
Uh, look.

100
00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:58.822
The point is we still got
two freak shows,


101
00:05:58.823 --> 00:06:01.090
one who can barely dance.

102
00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:03.660
One... person of color?

103
00:06:03.661 --> 00:06:04.994
I think you mean two.

104
00:06:04.995 --> 00:06:07.564
I mean, you're fucking Algerian,
bro.


105
00:06:07.565 --> 00:06:08.798
Armenian, asshole.

106
00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:10.366
Oh, right. Yeah.
Armenia.

Seize the day.


113
00:06:19.977 --> 00:06:21.678
- Am I right?
- Yeah! Yes.


114
00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:24.881
I'm Goddamned if I'm gonna let
my last memory of this business


115
00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:26.850
be getting laid off.
That's right.


116
00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:28.918

I'm going down in a... in a...


117

118
00:06:30.688 --> 00:06:32.355
Can I get an "Amen"?
Yes.


119
00:06:32.356 --> 00:06:33.990
Amen, brother!
Make it rain!


120

Amen!

121
00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:42.165
All right, let's cut this,
then sand it and stain it.


122
00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:46.169
Hey, Mike, any word
on that thing we talked about?


123
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.572
Uh... y... look.

124
00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:53.242
Yes, uh, is... is the answer,
but it just can't be right now.


125
00:06:53.243 --> 00:06:55.945
I mean, we need a couple more
reliable accounts


126
00:06:55.946 --> 00:06:58.716
before I can get a policy
for you.


127
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.584
All right?

128
00:07:00.585 --> 00:07:01.951
Yo, get outta here.

129
00:07:01.952 --> 00:07:03.853
Go have dinner with your family.
I can do this.

00:09:51.989 --> 00:09:53.790
Brought one for you, too.

164
00:09:55.192 --> 00:09:56.960
All right.
That's got the brace.


165

You got the knee brace in there.

C.E.O. Of my own company.


173
00:10:18.115 --> 00:10:19.983

Your girl gave you a hall pass?


175
00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:23.486
I don't need a hall pass,

177
00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:29.658
Oh, this is a horrible idea.
But you can't take it back now.


178
00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:31.560
So get the fuck on the Van.

179
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:33.997
Let's go.

This is like when Justin
came back to backstreet.


181
00:10:37.467 --> 00:10:40.203
You fucking kidding me?
Justin was in nsync.


182
00:10:40.204 --> 00:10:42.806
Kevin Richardson came back

Backstreet was

period.

Hey, Mikey, what do you
think of the truck, bro?


202
00:11:19.076 --> 00:11:21.410
This thing's fucking crazy.
Right?


203
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:23.947
Hey, so, I got my, uh,
my buddy Martín.


204
00:11:23.948 --> 00:11:26.049
He hooked me up with his uncle's
old roach coach.


205
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:27.817
And then I got
Tarzan back there


206
00:11:27.818 --> 00:11:29.953
to paint it up
all sick Picasso style.


207
00:11:29.954 --> 00:11:33.089
Yeah, I mean, I'm mostly
an oil-on-canvas guy,


208
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.959
but I did the best I could.

209
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.394
What exactly are y'all doing
out of it, though?


210
00:11:38.395 --> 00:11:41.197
I'm making artisanal

The whole thing's like
a healthy mobile block party.

It's crazy, right?

00:15:41.138 --> 00:15:42.871
All right. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.


315
00:15:42.872 --> 00:15:44.740
Mikey.
Oh, it's on!


316
00:17:40.457 --> 00:17:42.090
That's the plan.

317
00:17:42.091 --> 00:17:45.394
I mean, take over south beach,
then the entire east coast.


318
00:17:45.395 --> 00:17:46.995
Fucking mobile.

319
00:17:46.996 --> 00:17:49.865
You know, low-overhead,
high-revenue shit.


320
00:17:49.866 --> 00:17:51.667
That's how you get flush
in the food industry.


321
00:17:51.668 --> 00:17:53.202
Fuck, yeah. What is this?
It's really good.


322
00:17:53.203 --> 00:17:55.638
Oh, Goddamn right, what is this?
Jeez.


323
00:17:55.639 --> 00:17:57.873
Fuck.
What am I eating right now?


324
00:17:57.874 --> 00:17:59.808
- You like that, Mike?
- That's gold, right?


325
00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:01.277
This is amazing.

326
00:18:01.278 --> 00:18:03.379
It's toasted marshmallow
tangerine.


327
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.448
Whatever it is,
it's fabulous.


328
00:18:05.449 --> 00:18:07.850
Put marshmallow in my pants
right now.


329
00:18:07.851 --> 00:18:09.418
This is...
You gotta sell this.


330
00:18:09.419 --> 00:18:11.854
Mike, tip of the iceberg, baby.

331
00:18:11.855 --> 00:18:14.122
We got Kiwi olive oil
with freeze-dried basil,


332
00:18:14.123 --> 00:18:17.125
crème brulée... and my personal
favorite, the flavor of truth.


333
00:18:17.126 --> 00:18:19.662
Come on, man. You've been
talking about this shit forever.


334
00:18:19.663 --> 00:18:21.096
Why don't you tell
everybody here


335
00:18:21.097 --> 00:18:23.399
what you're really gonna
be doing come Monday morning.


336
00:18:25.569 --> 00:18:28.471
Grinding those snow cones
at the Northdale Mall.


337
00:18:28.472 --> 00:18:31.440
Yeah. Well, that's just
for market research, bitch.


338
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:33.842
Till we get the funds
to do what we really need.


339
00:18:33.843 --> 00:18:36.445
That's all it is, bro.
Fucking hater.


340
00:18:36.446 --> 00:18:39.748
Besides, I think it beats raking
the infield at Tropicana.


341
00:18:39.749 --> 00:18:43.452
Well, at least the shit
I'm working on can go global.


342
00:18:43.453 --> 00:18:44.620
What?

343
00:18:44.621 --> 00:18:46.455
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.


344
00:18:46.456 --> 00:18:47.890
I'm sorry.
What?


345
00:18:47.891 --> 00:18:51.260
Why don't you enlighten us,
constant gardener?


346
00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:52.795
Yeah, please...
Please enlighten me.


347
00:18:52.796 --> 00:18:54.797
I have to know what this, like,
piece of genius is.


348
00:18:54.798 --> 00:18:57.533
Shamwow us
with your ingenious invention.


349
00:18:57.534 --> 00:19:00.369
Come on, rich, man.
Tito laid his shit out.


350
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.704
Everybody's cool.
Just tell us.


351
00:19:01.705 --> 00:19:03.472
It's us, bro.

352
00:19:03.473 --> 00:19:04.740
Just tell us, man.

353
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:06.275
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.


354
00:19:06.276 --> 00:19:07.810
All right.

355
00:19:07.811 --> 00:19:09.845
But if any of you motherfuckers
steals my idea,


356
00:19:09.846 --> 00:19:10.879
I swear to God I will...

357
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.715
Why you got to point
at the fucking Mexican


358
00:19:12.716 --> 00:19:13.849
when you say "steals," dude?

359
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.684
We get it.
Just... just go.


360
00:19:15.685 --> 00:19:17.253
Let's have it, tough guy.

361
00:19:19.323 --> 00:19:20.989
Condomints.

362
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.092
What are the two most important
things you need to take with you


363
00:19:24.093 --> 00:19:26.228
when you go out on the weekend?

364
00:19:26.229 --> 00:19:28.030
Ketchup and mustard?

365
00:19:29.566 --> 00:19:31.834
Your condoms and your mints.

366
00:19:31.835 --> 00:19:33.936
Oh, my... what?

367
00:19:33.937 --> 00:19:36.572
I put them together in one
package, like a pack of gum.


368
00:19:36.573 --> 00:19:38.907
Sell it at a gas station.

369
00:19:38.908 --> 00:19:40.242
"Condomints."

370
00:19:40.243 --> 00:19:42.144
It's not bad.
Boom!


371
00:19:42.145 --> 00:19:45.213
Um, they... they already
have that shit, bitch.


372
00:19:45.214 --> 00:19:48.317
You can get it.

373
00:19:48.318 --> 00:19:50.486
I get it all the time
at the minimart.


374
00:19:50.487 --> 00:19:52.020
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:55.724
They're at every single circle k
and 7-Eleven across Florida.


376
00:19:55.725 --> 00:19:57.360
I'm so sorry, man.

377
00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:00.162
Hey, Richie, they didn't
sign the nondisclosure, man.


378
00:20:00.163 --> 00:20:01.530
Sorry about it.

379
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:02.931
Hey, Richie,
don't worry about it.


380
00:20:02.932 --> 00:20:04.567
I got something for you...
Top secret, man.


381
00:20:04.568 --> 00:20:07.603
Imagine this.
A small, little rectangle. Okay?


382
00:20:07.604 --> 00:20:10.138
You hold it up to your ear,
you speak into it,


383
00:20:10.139 --> 00:20:13.108
somebody in a distant land
with the exact same thing


384
00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:14.477
can hear it.

385
00:20:14.478 --> 00:20:16.178
I just haven't come up with
a name for it.


386
00:20:16.179 --> 00:20:17.913
I was figuring...

387
00:20:17.914 --> 00:20:20.383
Fuck... you.
I'm so sorry, man.


388
00:20:20.384 --> 00:20:22.117
Oh, God.

389
00:20:22.118 --> 00:20:25.621
Hey, I forgot to ask you...
You still with Mercedes?


390
00:20:25.622 --> 00:20:27.222
No.

391
00:20:27.223 --> 00:20:30.559
We agreed to try monogamy,
and you know Mercedes.


392
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.995
That shit lasted
for about two seconds.


393
00:20:32.996 --> 00:20:35.598
Wow. That fucking sucks.
I'm sorry.


394
00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:39.334
Ah, it's like Oprah said,
man...


395
00:20:39.335 --> 00:20:42.806
"when someone shows you
themselves, believe them."


396
00:20:44.808 --> 00:20:46.442
What? Really?

397
00:20:46.443 --> 00:20:48.511
Really? I... okay. Yeah, really.
That's what she said.


398
00:20:48.512 --> 00:20:50.245
Are we doing
this passive-aggressive shit?


399
00:20:50.246 --> 00:20:51.847
Okay. Fine. That's not
passive-aggressive, that's Oprah.


400
00:20:51.848 --> 00:20:53.281
Let's fucking make it
aggressive.


401
00:20:53.282 --> 00:20:55.884
How about this? Let's do
a little therapy session here.


402
00:20:55.885 --> 00:20:57.553
Old-school...
Old-school therapy session.


403
00:20:57.554 --> 00:20:58.987
Get up. Let's go. We're gonna
get this out in one swing.


404
00:20:58.988 --> 00:21:00.689
Are we fucking primates now, man?
Come on.


405
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.758
Get it out in one hit and let's
not talk about it anymore.


406
00:21:02.759 --> 00:21:05.461
I get it. You're mad that... that I fucking
left. This is seriously fucking stupid.


407
00:21:05.462 --> 00:21:06.929
Come on, baby.
Let's go. Right here.


408
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.864
Just don't hit me in the fucking nuts.
Bam. Wow.


409
00:21:08.865 --> 00:21:10.633
Are you kidding me? Stop being a pussy.
Everybody fucking happy?


410
00:21:10.634 --> 00:21:12.000
Stop being a pussy. Let's go.
No, man.


411
00:21:12.001 --> 00:21:13.702
Don't you call me a fucking
pussy, Christian Bale.


412
00:21:13.703 --> 00:21:15.170
No. He didn't call you a pussy.

413
00:21:15.171 --> 00:21:17.406
He... he just said you exhibited
pussy-like behavior.


414
00:21:17.407 --> 00:21:19.141
Y'all want to unleash the fucking tiger?
It's just the behavior of a pussy.


415
00:21:19.142 --> 00:21:20.609
Is that what you want? Come on!
Release the demon!


416
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.010
Oh! Shit!

417
00:21:22.011 --> 00:21:23.479
Tiger's out.

418
00:21:28.317 --> 00:21:31.587
Are you okay, man?

419
00:21:31.588 --> 00:21:33.589
You feel better?

420
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.257
No, man,
I don't fucking feel better.


421
00:21:35.258 --> 00:21:36.992
That was seriously fucked up.

422
00:21:36.993 --> 00:21:38.694
Okay.

423
00:21:38.695 --> 00:21:39.962
Good.
You all right?


424
00:21:39.963 --> 00:21:41.930
Yeah.
I just got to pee a little.


425
00:21:41.931 --> 00:21:44.366
Everybody happy? You get
your fucking gladiator show?


426
00:21:44.367 --> 00:21:45.668
That was fucking awesome.

427
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:47.135
No, it wasn't fucking awesome,
man.


428
00:21:47.136 --> 00:21:48.937
There are a lot better ways
to handle that shit.


429
00:21:48.938 --> 00:21:50.939
It's our last fucking ride.
I'm outta here.


430
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.375
You know, it's always
the pretty ones, like Bundy.


431
00:21:55.579 --> 00:21:56.879
It is, man.

432
00:21:59.783 --> 00:22:02.618
There you go. That's it.
That... that's perfect.


433
00:22:20.069 --> 00:22:22.337
Yo. That's
protected land, sir!


434
00:22:22.338 --> 00:22:25.908
You're destroying sea Turtle
biosphere with that urine.


435
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:27.776
Are you serious right now?
Come on.


436
00:22:27.777 --> 00:22:30.145
Really? All right.
Well, don't look at me.


437
00:22:30.146 --> 00:22:32.414
Look out into the ocean.
Got it. I got it.


438
00:22:32.415 --> 00:22:33.749
Get the picture here?
I'm running out.


439
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.818
Yes. Thank you.
I'm done.


440
00:22:35.819 --> 00:22:38.153
That's... that's it.
There we go.


441
00:22:38.154 --> 00:22:42.925
That's... that's usually what
happens when I pee on the beach.


442
00:22:42.926 --> 00:22:45.427
Yeah. Yeah.

443
00:22:45.428 --> 00:22:47.963
Drag queens. That's, uh...

444
00:22:47.964 --> 00:22:50.098
Ooh, doing Drag Queen stuff.

445
00:22:50.099 --> 00:22:52.467
You love Drag Queens.

446
00:22:52.468 --> 00:22:53.836
Yep.

447
00:22:53.837 --> 00:22:57.239
I am one,
so I seek out my people.


448
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.375
You are one? You are one?
Mm-hmm. On the inside.


449
00:23:00.376 --> 00:23:01.476
Got it.
Mostly.


450
00:23:01.477 --> 00:23:02.711
Of course it's on the inside.

451
00:23:02.712 --> 00:23:03.946
Yeah.
What's her name?


452
00:23:03.947 --> 00:23:05.347
Dolly Titz.

453
00:23:05.348 --> 00:23:06.381
Dolly Tits?

454
00:23:06.382 --> 00:23:07.382
With a "z."

455
00:23:07.383 --> 00:23:08.450
With a "z."
Mm-hmm.


456
00:23:08.451 --> 00:23:09.518
Where is she from?

457
00:23:09.519 --> 00:23:10.719
Here.
Okay.


458
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.355
And she loves couponing
and Nascar.


459
00:23:13.356 --> 00:23:15.223
I got an inner Drag Queen, too.

460
00:23:15.224 --> 00:23:16.424
Oh. Really?
Yeah.


461
00:23:16.425 --> 00:23:18.326
Okay. I figured.

462
00:23:18.327 --> 00:23:19.995
Uh, what's her name?

463
00:23:19.996 --> 00:23:21.830
Her name is...

464
00:23:21.831 --> 00:23:24.432
Clitoria Labia is her name.

465
00:23:24.433 --> 00:23:25.934
That's actually not bad.

466
00:23:25.935 --> 00:23:28.136
It's not bad at all.
She's... she's the main bitch.


467
00:23:28.137 --> 00:23:30.673
She's like Cheetara
and Grace Jones.


468
00:23:30.674 --> 00:23:33.842
And they always sing
"Rapper's Delight"


469
00:23:33.843 --> 00:23:35.377
everywhere they go.

470
00:23:38.782 --> 00:23:43.719
So, you and your friends, um,
frequent drag shows, do you?


471
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.988
No.
Not... well, somet...


472
00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:48.657
We just do it on the way up
to myrtle beach every year.


473
00:23:48.658 --> 00:23:50.759
Right.
Oh, right.


474
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.662
This stripper convention
that I keep hearing about.


475
00:23:53.663 --> 00:23:56.599
Yep.
It's the infamous convention.


476
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.101
Which one are you, then?
You, um...


477
00:23:59.102 --> 00:24:00.202
Which what?

478
00:24:00.203 --> 00:24:04.573
Are you Cop in a thong
or Iron Man in a thong?


479
00:24:04.574 --> 00:24:06.842
I am... I am...

480
00:24:06.843 --> 00:24:08.777
You're gonna have to pay
to see that.


481
00:24:08.778 --> 00:24:11.179
That's what I am.

482
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.850
Or I'll just load up on all
those fantastic '80s hair bands


483
00:24:14.851 --> 00:24:16.652
for my drive instead.

484
00:24:16.653 --> 00:24:17.786
Where you going?
Where you headed?


485
00:24:17.787 --> 00:24:21.156
Uh...
Just on the road again.


486
00:24:21.157 --> 00:24:23.325
New York this time.
Okay.


487
00:24:23.326 --> 00:24:25.093
Um, and I...

488
00:24:25.094 --> 00:24:28.263
Basically, I'm just trying to
avoid ending up on the pole.


489
00:24:28.264 --> 00:24:29.632
Like you.

490
00:24:29.633 --> 00:24:31.366
But you never know.

491
00:24:31.367 --> 00:24:34.202
"Stripper pissing on beach
in contemplative pose"


492
00:24:34.203 --> 00:24:36.038
could sell for thousands
one day.


493
00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:38.440
If that's true,
then I will whip it out


494
00:24:38.441 --> 00:24:41.710
and start peeing on whatever
you tell me to pee on,


495
00:24:41.711 --> 00:24:43.712
and we can just...
We can cash in.


496
00:24:43.713 --> 00:24:46.548
Fantastic.
I love the Enthusiasm.


497
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:48.050
Save some of it, though,

498
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:51.153
because you and I are gonna
untie that sailboat over there


499
00:24:51.154 --> 00:24:53.822
and organize a first-ever
cross-dressing search party


500
00:24:53.823 --> 00:24:54.890
out to that island.

501
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:56.024
What do you say?

502
00:24:56.025 --> 00:24:58.827
Uh...
Win or Die, stripper guy.


503
00:24:58.828 --> 00:25:00.863
I
-I say that, um...

504
00:25:00.864 --> 00:25:03.265
I would actually love
to do that.


505
00:25:03.266 --> 00:25:05.734
But I'd say I know what happens
on that island,


506
00:25:05.735 --> 00:25:08.737
and I just... that's just...
Mm-hmm.


507
00:25:08.738 --> 00:25:10.105
I think I'm gonna opt out.

508
00:25:10.106 --> 00:25:13.408
Oh.
What happens on that island?


509
00:25:13.409 --> 00:25:17.212
It's just I know what happens
for me on that island.


510
00:25:17.213 --> 00:25:19.614
Oh, I see.

511
00:25:19.615 --> 00:25:21.950
You think I'm gonna hook up
with you. Mm.


512
00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:24.319
That's not at all what I said.
At all.


513
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.288
That's the farthest thing
from what I said.


514
00:25:26.289 --> 00:25:28.323
'Cause I said I would want to go
to that island,


515
00:25:28.324 --> 00:25:30.258
and then I know
what I would do


516
00:25:30.259 --> 00:25:32.360
and then somehow that probably
wouldn't work out


517
00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:34.697
on any level that I would
want it to work out on,


518
00:25:34.698 --> 00:25:36.098
and then I think

519
00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:38.500
that it's probably better
if I just go back.


520
00:25:38.501 --> 00:25:39.968
Yeah.

521
00:25:39.969 --> 00:25:41.136
Wow.

522
00:25:41.137 --> 00:25:42.237
Okay.

523
00:25:42.238 --> 00:25:46.141
Well, fret not, Casanova.
You're safe with me.


524
00:25:46.142 --> 00:25:48.677
I'm not going through
a guy phase anyway.


525
00:25:48.678 --> 00:25:50.112
Oh.

526
00:25:50.113 --> 00:25:52.514
Well, in that case,
that makes things easier.


527
00:25:52.515 --> 00:25:55.250
Yeah. 'Cause then
all the more reason


528
00:25:55.251 --> 00:25:58.887
for me to probably just go do
the good-night thing.


529
00:25:58.888 --> 00:26:00.322
Okay. Yeah.

530
00:26:00.323 --> 00:26:02.991
It was nice to meet you, though,
Dolly Titz.


531
00:26:02.992 --> 00:26:06.162
Back at you, Clitoria.

532
00:26:27.016 --> 00:26:29.517
Good morning.
Good morning.


533
00:26:29.518 --> 00:26:32.154
You sleep okay?

534
00:26:32.155 --> 00:26:35.290
Yeah.
Actually, I did.


535
00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:37.492
Mm-hmm.

536
00:26:39.996 --> 00:26:42.464
My meditation was really clear
this morning, man.


537
00:26:42.465 --> 00:26:46.803
I just... just feel like I got
a lot of the negativity out.


538
00:26:48.404 --> 00:26:49.537
That's... that's good.

539
00:26:49.538 --> 00:26:50.672
Yeah.
That's good.


540
00:26:50.673 --> 00:26:52.308
I'm happy you feel lighter.

541
00:26:53.977 --> 00:26:56.879
I'm happy you finally got
what you wanted, man.


542
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.113
Yeah?
I am.


543
00:26:58.114 --> 00:27:00.548
No. I... we say shit
all the fucking time,


544
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:01.984
but you went and did it, man.

545
00:27:01.985 --> 00:27:04.052
I'm jealous.
Oh... oh, shut the fuck up.


546
00:27:04.053 --> 00:27:06.021
All right?
I'm fucking jealous. I am.


547
00:27:06.022 --> 00:27:08.023
No. If there's anybody
that was jealous, it was me.


548
00:27:08.024 --> 00:27:10.525
What? Every time I would come
over to your apartment...


549
00:27:10.526 --> 00:27:12.727
Remember?
I'd put on your tide commercial.


550
00:27:13.729 --> 00:27:15.563
That shit was dope.

551
00:27:15.564 --> 00:27:19.001
♪ For that extra clean! ♪
♪ For that extra clean! ♪


552
00:27:19.002 --> 00:27:21.636
Ding!
Oh, shit.


553
00:27:21.637 --> 00:27:23.005
I mean, Lookit.

554
00:27:23.006 --> 00:27:24.606
I would...
I would think to myself,


555
00:27:24.607 --> 00:27:27.109
"I'd be set if I could just get
to where Ken was."


556
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.576
Yeah, I'm real set here.

557
00:27:28.577 --> 00:27:29.912
I'm real set.

558
00:27:29.913 --> 00:27:32.347
My agent's got me doing
Youtube videos now, man.


559
00:27:32.348 --> 00:27:35.350
So what are you gonna do
after this weekend?


560
00:27:35.351 --> 00:27:38.220
Send my head shot around,
hope for the best.


561
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:42.191
There's a casting director comes
by the club sometimes, so...


562
00:27:44.527 --> 00:27:45.693
I'm still pretty.

563
00:27:45.694 --> 00:27:48.296
Yeah.

564
00:27:48.297 --> 00:27:52.868
I know you're still pretty,
but look at these guys.


565
00:27:52.869 --> 00:27:55.370
What are they gonna do
after this?


566
00:27:55.371 --> 00:27:56.905
I don't know.

567
00:27:56.906 --> 00:27:59.107
Morning, gorgeous.

568
00:27:59.108 --> 00:28:01.609
Oh, my God,
did you guys even sleep?


569
00:28:04.013 --> 00:28:05.981
Are the girls still here
or they leave?


570
00:28:05.982 --> 00:28:09.217
Oh, they left about a...
About an hour ago.


571
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.221
Did you, uh,
did you bangee?


572
00:28:13.222 --> 00:28:15.358
You bangee?
Show him the thing.


573
00:28:17.726 --> 00:28:19.627
Wow.

574
00:28:19.628 --> 00:28:21.096
That's... okay.

575
00:28:21.097 --> 00:28:24.199
She said if I had reason to call
before it faded,


576
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.934
then maybe it was meant to be.

577
00:28:25.935 --> 00:28:28.436
Oh.
That's... that's romantic.


578
00:28:28.437 --> 00:28:31.573
They're staying in Charleston
tonight, so...


579
00:28:31.574 --> 00:28:33.341
I don't know.
It's smack dab on our way.


580
00:28:33.342 --> 00:28:35.010
Maybe it was meant to be.
Yeah, man.


581
00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:37.012
Good work on that,
by the way.


582
00:28:37.013 --> 00:28:38.346
What about you?

583
00:28:38.347 --> 00:28:39.282
Did you bangee?

584
00:28:39.283 --> 00:28:42.017
No.
No?


585
00:28:42.018 --> 00:28:45.287
I haven't had actual sex
in almost five months.


586
00:28:45.288 --> 00:28:48.623
Every time a chick gets...
A look at it,


587
00:28:48.624 --> 00:28:51.593
she's like, "how about
a blow job or hand job?"


588
00:28:51.594 --> 00:28:53.361
Well...

589
00:28:53.362 --> 00:28:55.763
Just got to find
the right lady, man.


590
00:28:55.764 --> 00:28:57.365
That's unfortunate for you.

591
00:28:57.366 --> 00:28:59.968
It's like a blessing and a curse
at the same time, huh?


592
00:28:59.969 --> 00:29:01.436
Laugh at my plight.

593
00:29:01.437 --> 00:29:03.906
Look, m-maybe it's like
the glass slipper, man.


594
00:29:03.907 --> 00:29:06.408
You just need to find
the right one.


595
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:08.310
Dude, I'm 35 years old, okay?

596
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:10.946
If it hasn't happened already,
it ain't gonna happen.


597
00:29:10.947 --> 00:29:12.780
Let's face it,
I'm probably fucked.


598
00:29:12.781 --> 00:29:14.416
Oh.
All right.


599
00:29:14.417 --> 00:29:16.885
On that note, uh, let's get
this circus back on the road.


600
00:29:16.886 --> 00:29:19.354
Who wants to see if Tarzan died
in his sleep last night?


601
00:29:19.355 --> 00:29:22.157
Fuck that, man.
I woke him up last time.


602
00:29:22.158 --> 00:29:24.092
I'll do it.
I got it.


603
00:29:24.093 --> 00:29:27.130
I'll clean up
the nonbiodegradables.


604
00:29:35.804 --> 00:29:36.972
What's up, bro?

605
00:29:36.973 --> 00:29:38.907
A little, uh,
breakfast of champions?


606
00:29:38.908 --> 00:29:40.542
Molly?
Yeah.


607
00:29:40.543 --> 00:29:42.344
You realize we'll be useless
in an hour.


608
00:29:42.345 --> 00:29:44.279
What are you, fucking 12, dude?
Just take it.


609
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.081
Oh, fuck!
All right. Fine.


610
00:29:46.082 --> 00:29:48.050
Guess I know
what today's gonna be like.


611
00:29:48.051 --> 00:29:51.386
All right,
get your moon rocks!


612
00:29:51.387 --> 00:29:54.056
All right. So what's the plan
about this thing?


613
00:29:54.057 --> 00:29:55.623
Okay.
So we got it all planned out.


614
00:29:55.624 --> 00:29:57.359
Tobias is gonna warm up
the crowd,


615
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.693
then we're gonna hit them

616
00:29:58.694 --> 00:30:00.595
with the old 4th of July
army routine. Oorah.


617
00:30:00.596 --> 00:30:02.464
That still makes me
feel like a warmonger


618
00:30:02.465 --> 00:30:04.399
with everything going on
politically right now.


619
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.301
Oh, come on
with the hippie shit.


620
00:30:06.302 --> 00:30:07.902
It's in season.
We're doing it.


621
00:30:07.903 --> 00:30:10.472
Hey, if you want that Karma,
go for it, all right?


622
00:30:10.473 --> 00:30:13.341
We're gonna hit them with
"Raining Men" right after.


623
00:30:13.342 --> 00:30:14.342
Right.

624
00:30:14.343 --> 00:30:16.311
Then Tobias is gonna intro
the solos.


625
00:30:16.312 --> 00:30:17.479
Listen.

626
00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.482
I think you should bring back
"Pony," bro.


627
00:30:20.483 --> 00:30:22.584
I could do that.

628
00:30:22.585 --> 00:30:24.652
And I'm...
Look, "Pony" is great.


629
00:30:24.653 --> 00:30:27.255
I have, uh...
Can I pitch you something?


630
00:30:27.256 --> 00:30:28.890
Let me just
throw something out.


631
00:30:28.891 --> 00:30:32.194
And I completely understand that
I'm coming in at the 11th hour,


632
00:30:32.195 --> 00:30:34.062
and I don't want to step
on toes.


633
00:30:34.063 --> 00:30:36.198
But what if...

634
00:30:36.199 --> 00:30:38.000
I mean, if this really is
our last ride,


635
00:30:38.001 --> 00:30:40.768
what if we make up some new shit
and go out with a fucking bang


636
00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:43.205
and just burn this shit down
with some new routines?


637
00:30:43.206 --> 00:30:45.707
We... we can't do that, man.
We got two days.


638
00:30:45.708 --> 00:30:49.144
I mean, Mike, that's what
we've rehearsed, man.


639
00:30:49.145 --> 00:30:52.114
Yeah, and don't call our shit lame, bro.
You're right. You know what?


640
00:30:52.115 --> 00:30:53.648
I'm not calling your shit lame.

641
00:30:53.649 --> 00:30:55.517
I'm just saying that cowboys
and firemen dancing to '80s rock


642
00:30:55.518 --> 00:30:57.519
is not... not lame.
No. You know what is lame?


643
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.521
Looking like a bag of dicks
at our last convention


644
00:30:59.522 --> 00:31:01.589
'cause we don't have
our fucking act straight.


645
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.590
Okay.
Point taken.


646
00:31:02.591 --> 00:31:04.792
Let me ask you a question,
though.


647
00:31:04.793 --> 00:31:06.528
Um... okay.

648
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:09.164
You're still doing, uh,
the fireman routine, right?


649
00:31:09.165 --> 00:31:10.465
You know it.
All right.


650
00:31:10.466 --> 00:31:12.434
Have you ever wanted to be
a fireman?


651
00:31:12.435 --> 00:31:15.037
A real one?
Yes, a real fireman.


652
00:31:15.038 --> 00:31:16.971
No.
I got the phobia thing.


653
00:31:16.972 --> 00:31:18.373
You have a fire phobia.
Okay.


654
00:31:18.374 --> 00:31:20.575
So, uh, you still doing it
to that... that kiss song?


655
00:31:20.576 --> 00:31:22.077
Fuck, yeah.
"Hotter than Hell."


656
00:31:22.078 --> 00:31:23.478
"Hotter than Hell."
Do you like that song?


657
00:31:23.479 --> 00:31:24.579
Crushes.

658
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.581
I know it crushes,
but do you like it?


659
00:31:26.582 --> 00:31:28.850
Do you play it
when you're not onstage?


660
00:31:28.851 --> 00:31:30.318
I don't see your point here.

661
00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:32.454
My point is, if you don't
like it, why did you pick it?


662
00:31:32.455 --> 00:31:34.122
Well, I didn't pick it.
Dallas did.


663
00:31:34.123 --> 00:31:35.723
Exactly my point.
Dallas picked it.


664
00:31:35.724 --> 00:31:37.825
You didn't pick it, so it's not
on the inside. You know what?


665
00:31:37.826 --> 00:31:39.861
Just because you made up some of
your own routines back in the day


666
00:31:39.862 --> 00:31:41.663
doesn't mean that you get to
waltz back in here


667
00:31:41.664 --> 00:31:43.565
after three years and try to
tell us how to run our own shit.


668
00:31:43.566 --> 00:31:45.467
I'm not trying to tell you
what the fuck to do. No!


669
00:31:45.468 --> 00:31:46.901
I'm just say...
There is no fucking universe


670
00:31:46.902 --> 00:31:50.239
in which I am not doing
that fireman routine!


671
00:31:53.209 --> 00:31:54.409
You can find it, man.

672
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.244
You got to just, like,
let go, okay?


673
00:31:56.245 --> 00:31:58.146
I fucking got it!
What? What?


674
00:31:58.147 --> 00:32:00.215
Yo, it's like
a fucking real wedding,


675
00:32:00.216 --> 00:32:02.150
- except like a fantasy.
- Oh, my God, dude!


676
00:32:02.151 --> 00:32:03.618
And, like, I go out in the crowd...
Yes!


677
00:32:03.619 --> 00:32:05.620
...and find myself, like,
a real fucking bride.


678
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:08.523
Oh, fuck! And I do
everything with her!


679
00:32:08.524 --> 00:32:10.658
Like, I'll have a ring
and everything,


680
00:32:10.659 --> 00:32:13.595
and I'll propose to her, and people
throw rice. They are throwing rice!


681
00:32:13.596 --> 00:32:15.763
Rice out of our fucking pants! Yes.
Dude, they're fucking...


682
00:32:15.764 --> 00:32:17.565
They're all... everyone's throwing rice.
It's just so complex.


683
00:32:17.566 --> 00:32:19.000
Or birdseed. What are you
fucking talking about, man?!


684
00:32:19.001 --> 00:32:20.568
Yo, man, I'm not
a fucking dancer like you.


685
00:32:20.569 --> 00:32:22.337
I just can't come up with shit
on the spot.


686
00:32:22.338 --> 00:32:25.340
No, it's not... it's not about
being a dancer, Richie.


687
00:32:25.341 --> 00:32:26.808
It's not.
Okay, look.


688
00:32:26.809 --> 00:32:29.777
"Pony"... it's not... that
wasn't a dance routine, okay?


689
00:32:29.778 --> 00:32:32.947
All it was is I was at a party
and saw this badass girl.


690
00:32:32.948 --> 00:32:34.416
And she was with her boyfriend,

691
00:32:34.417 --> 00:32:36.718
and he did not look like
he was hitting that shit right.


692
00:32:36.719 --> 00:32:38.953
So that... that song came on,
and all I did was just...


693
00:32:38.954 --> 00:32:41.489
All I did was just, like,
imagine what I would do to her.


694
00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.458
That was it.
That was all "Pony" ever was.


695
00:32:43.459 --> 00:32:45.193
No, man.
It sounds fucking complex.


696
00:32:45.194 --> 00:32:47.462
Why is that... no, it's not.
Look at... look at you!


697
00:32:47.463 --> 00:32:49.063
You're a fucking Greek God.

698
00:32:49.064 --> 00:32:50.598
You could fucking tie your shoe

699
00:32:50.599 --> 00:32:52.534
and make some girl's
entire year, man.


700
00:32:52.535 --> 00:32:54.035
It's just got to come from
in here.


701
00:32:54.036 --> 00:32:56.037
Seriously? You just have to be you.
Yeah. I know so.


702
00:32:56.038 --> 00:32:57.272
You know what?
Fuck that.


703
00:32:57.273 --> 00:32:58.806
I bet you you can go in there
right now...


704
00:32:58.807 --> 00:33:01.075
I bet you you can go in there
and fucking make her day.


705
00:33:01.076 --> 00:33:02.944
Who, her? Tarzan: Hell, yeah.
Hell, yeah.


706
00:33:02.945 --> 00:33:04.946
That girl looks like
she's never fucking smiled


707
00:33:04.947 --> 00:33:07.315
in her entire fucking life.
Then that's your goal.


708
00:33:07.316 --> 00:33:08.816
That is your goal. All the
more reason, man. What?


709
00:33:08.817 --> 00:33:10.185
You got to go in there
and make her smile. No!


710
00:33:10.186 --> 00:33:11.319
That's it.
That's all you've got to do.


711
00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.620
Yes.
And if you... look.


712
00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:14.489
If you can't do that,
then no one fucking can,


713
00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:16.391
and I'll go back and do
the fucking old routines.


714
00:33:16.392 --> 00:33:18.826
Oh, fuck! That's a fair deal.
That's a fair deal.


715
00:33:18.827 --> 00:33:21.229
You're not a fucking...
You're not a fireman, Richie!


716
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.298
You're not a fireman.
I want to hear you say it.


717
00:33:23.299 --> 00:33:24.966
"I'm not a fireman."
"I am not a fireman."


718
00:33:24.967 --> 00:33:26.568
I want to hear you say...
Well, I'm not a fucking fireman.


719
00:33:26.569 --> 00:33:28.403
You hate fire!
I'm a fucking male entertainer.


720
00:33:28.404 --> 00:33:29.571
Exactly!
You're a male entertainer.


721
00:33:29.572 --> 00:33:30.905
Right, man.
You can fucking do it.


722
00:33:30.906 --> 00:33:32.106
Now go do it!
B.D.R.!


723
00:33:32.107 --> 00:33:33.141
B.D.R.!

724
00:33:33.142 --> 00:33:34.709
Come on!
B.D.R.! B.D.R.!


725
00:33:39.748 --> 00:33:40.815
Make her day, dude.

726
00:33:40.816 --> 00:33:42.884

That was spiritual, man.

762
00:35:50.313 --> 00:35:51.879
Yes!
I'm proud of you, buddy.


763
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.247
We can do this.

764
00:35:53.248 --> 00:35:54.549
We can do this!
We can do this.


765
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.285
We've got to come up with
new shit, okay?


766
00:35:57.286 --> 00:35:59.587
Fucking history right here,
okay?


767
00:35:59.588 --> 00:36:01.489
This shit is history.
Gone.


768
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:04.191
We've got to get rid of it.
Out with the past.


769
00:36:04.192 --> 00:36:05.793
I never wanted to be
in the Navy!


770
00:36:05.794 --> 00:36:07.829
I don't want this "Top Gun" shit.
Fuck the Navy, man.


771
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.096
Yeah!
Gone!


772
00:36:09.097 --> 00:36:11.666
Oh, baby!
It's time.


773
00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:13.067
That shit itched.
It's time.


774
00:36:13.068 --> 00:36:14.168
Boom.

775
00:36:14.169 --> 00:36:15.437
Boom!
That's outta here, baby!


776
00:36:15.438 --> 00:36:17.339
Fuck that thing!
Richie?


777
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.374
Done! Fireman over!
Not anymore.


778
00:36:19.375 --> 00:36:21.476
I'm not a fireman anymore!

779
00:36:21.477 --> 00:36:22.810
Get it outta here.
Don't, man. Don't.


780
00:36:22.811 --> 00:36:24.446
I'll... I'll throw it away
when we get back.


781
00:36:24.447 --> 00:36:25.680
No, no, no.
Now!


782
00:36:25.681 --> 00:36:27.882
It's over.
History!


783
00:36:27.883 --> 00:36:28.784
New stuff.

784
00:36:28.785 --> 00:36:31.653
I love you guys.
I... look.


785
00:36:31.654 --> 00:36:32.954
I've missed you guys so much.

786
00:36:32.955 --> 00:36:34.689
I know we're rolling face
right now,


787
00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.325
but, like, I just need you guys
to know how much I love you.


788
00:36:37.326 --> 00:36:39.226
I missed you so much, man.

789
00:36:39.227 --> 00:36:40.562
There was a giant hole
inside of me


790
00:36:40.563 --> 00:36:42.129
that was created when you left.

791
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.831
I'm here now. And now I
feel like it's full again.


792
00:36:43.832 --> 00:36:45.667
- I love you, man.
- Let's sync this shit up.


793
00:36:45.668 --> 00:36:47.134
We gotta sync this up.

794
00:36:47.135 --> 00:36:49.671
We're syncing up the energy.
I fucking love you, man!


795
00:36:49.672 --> 00:36:51.773
Give me your hands, man.

796
00:36:51.774 --> 00:36:52.907
Whoo!

797
00:36:52.908 --> 00:36:55.176
I take it y'all motherfuckers
feel that?


798
00:36:55.177 --> 00:36:56.210
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!


799
00:36:56.211 --> 00:36:58.245
That is our energies, man.

800
00:36:58.246 --> 00:37:00.181
We are connected.
Hold...


801
00:37:00.182 --> 00:37:02.917
Toby! Toby, throw it back here,
brother. We need you.


802
00:37:02.918 --> 00:37:04.352
Come on.
Come on, man, sync up.


803
00:37:04.353 --> 00:37:06.320
Come on!
This is powerful, man!


804
00:37:06.321 --> 00:37:08.022
You feel that rhythm?
Oh, yeah.


805
00:37:08.023 --> 00:37:09.691
♪ Mm, mm-mm-mm ♪

806
00:37:09.692 --> 00:37:10.858
Yeah.
Ooh, yeah.


807
00:37:10.859 --> 00:37:12.960
♪ Mm, mm-mm-mm ♪
I love you guys!


808
00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:14.128
That's our pulse, man.

809
00:37:14.129 --> 00:37:16.431
I am so thankful
that we are all here together


810
00:37:16.432 --> 00:37:17.665
on this last ride, man.

811
00:37:17.666 --> 00:37:19.934
Everybody...
Everybody close your eyes


812
00:37:19.935 --> 00:37:23.438
and let's just appreciate it,
not as six beings, but as one.


813
00:37:23.439 --> 00:37:25.573
As one.
As one. As one unit, man.


814
00:37:25.574 --> 00:37:27.108
One fucking unit.

815
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:29.043
As one. We've got to move
into the future as one.


816
00:37:29.044 --> 00:37:31.646
As one unit.
One unit moving as one.


817
00:37:31.647 --> 00:37:33.180
The past is over!

818
00:37:33.181 --> 00:37:34.482
Yeah.

819
00:37:34.483 --> 00:37:37.553
Shit!

820
00:37:42.858 --> 00:37:44.526
Ugh.

821
00:37:44.527 --> 00:37:45.960
Fuck!
What the hell happened?


822
00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:47.629
Ow! Get off!
Get off my fucking leg!


823
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:48.630
Ugh. Fuck!

824
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:49.931
Is everybody okay?

825
00:37:49.932 --> 00:37:52.434
No, I'm not fucking okay!
I'm not okay at all!


826
00:37:52.435 --> 00:37:56.070
Oh, shit.
Hey, we got a man down!


827
00:37:56.071 --> 00:37:57.772
Oh, fuck.
Where'd that come from?


828
00:37:57.773 --> 00:37:59.541
He hit his fucking head there.
Oh, shit.


829
00:37:59.542 --> 00:38:00.908
He's okay.

830
00:38:00.909 --> 00:38:03.110
Your friend suffered
a Grade-2 concussion


831
00:38:03.111 --> 00:38:04.311
and required some stitches.

832
00:38:04.312 --> 00:38:06.914
So he's gonna live?
Yes.


833
00:38:06.915 --> 00:38:10.485
He'll need to stay here
for 48 hours of observation.


834
00:38:10.486 --> 00:38:11.486
He's in here.

835
00:38:11.487 --> 00:38:12.987
My pupils bugging out?

836
00:38:12.988 --> 00:38:14.622
Shh. Be cool.

837
00:38:14.623 --> 00:38:17.692
You think she knows?

838
00:38:20.128 --> 00:38:22.597
Oh, shit, man.

839
00:38:22.598 --> 00:38:24.666
Hey. Toby.

840
00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:26.601
What's up, buddy? Hey, bro.
What's up, man?


841
00:38:26.602 --> 00:38:28.035
Oh, fuck.
Hey, guys.


842
00:38:28.036 --> 00:38:29.136
I'm so fucking sorry.

843
00:38:29.137 --> 00:38:30.972
No. No. I shouldn't have reached
for you, man.


844
00:38:30.973 --> 00:38:32.740
Fuck, man.
I shouldn't have closed my eyes.


845
00:38:32.741 --> 00:38:34.008
Well, that's definitely true.

846
00:38:34.009 --> 00:38:36.444
Fuck, yeah.
I mean, what were you thinking?


847
00:38:36.445 --> 00:38:37.779
Hey. Hey, hey.
Go easy on him, man.


848
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.214
Come on. Look at him.
Easy? He's fine.


849
00:38:40.215 --> 00:38:43.651
Right? Yeah, I'm fine, but
the fucking truck, man.


850
00:38:43.652 --> 00:38:45.052
Yeah, the truck is towed.

851
00:38:45.053 --> 00:38:47.589
It's going to take a few days
to fix it.


852
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.491
But I think we can afford it.

853
00:38:49.492 --> 00:38:51.926
I just... I don't know
about the paint job.


854
00:38:51.927 --> 00:38:54.496
It won't be original,
but, uh, I can get it close.


855
00:38:54.497 --> 00:38:55.863
Are you in pain, man?

856
00:38:55.864 --> 00:38:57.899
Yeah. They gave me a little bit
of something,


857
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.568
but it's just, like, shit.
Yeah, I'm feeling that.


858
00:39:02.471 --> 00:39:04.038
What are you doing?

859
00:39:04.039 --> 00:39:05.607
Reiki.

860
00:39:05.608 --> 00:39:07.609
I'm a level-3 healer.

861
00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.910
Oh, shit.

862
00:39:08.911 --> 00:39:11.646
This fucking sucks.

863
00:39:11.647 --> 00:39:14.448
No fucking M.C.
No fucking whip.


864
00:39:14.449 --> 00:39:15.817
No fucking costumes!

865
00:39:15.818 --> 00:39:17.251
That was a brilliant idea.

866
00:39:17.252 --> 00:39:19.153
Throwing the fucking costumes
out the window?


867
00:39:19.154 --> 00:39:22.189
Stupid! Just chill, man. No, man.
It's an Omen, okay?


868
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:23.725
It's a sign.

869
00:39:23.726 --> 00:39:27.028
We're exactly where we're
supposed to be, all right?


870
00:39:27.029 --> 00:39:30.798
Please spare us the fucking
Gandhi routine right now!


871
00:39:30.799 --> 00:39:32.967
Okay.
You have so much anger, man.


872
00:39:32.968 --> 00:39:35.236
And it is all in your heart
chakra, and it's fucking toxic.


873
00:39:35.237 --> 00:39:37.939
Look, guys, please just chill. I
don't even know what that means!


874
00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.407
Come on! This is the comedown
from the Molly.


875
00:39:40.408 --> 00:39:44.245
Get a grip. God. You're Goddamn
right it's fucking comedown!


876
00:39:44.246 --> 00:39:45.547
This trip's over!

877
00:39:45.548 --> 00:39:48.382
All I wanted
was one more fucking ride!


878
00:39:48.383 --> 00:39:50.251
Is that too much to ask?

879
00:39:50.252 --> 00:39:51.719
Aw.

880
00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.187
Is Richie gonna cry

881
00:39:53.188 --> 00:39:55.356
because life isn't exactly
the way he wants it right now?


882
00:39:55.357 --> 00:39:57.825
Oh, okay, Mr. C.E.O.

883
00:39:57.826 --> 00:39:59.727
Why don't you take
your bullshit advice


884
00:39:59.728 --> 00:40:02.764
and give it
to your fucking employees?


885
00:40:02.765 --> 00:40:04.599
Employees?
I have one employee.


886
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.768
And I can't even pay
for his healthcare.


887
00:40:06.769 --> 00:40:09.303
But I bust my ass every month
to keep it going.


888
00:40:09.304 --> 00:40:11.372
So don't act like
we don't all have problems.


889
00:40:11.373 --> 00:40:13.040
All right?
Oh, whatever, man.


890
00:40:13.041 --> 00:40:15.943
I'm the one who told you coming
with us was a horrible idea.


891
00:40:15.944 --> 00:40:20.882
Oh, it's been the year
of the horrible idea, man.


892
00:40:20.883 --> 00:40:23.217
You want to see
another horrible idea?


893
00:40:23.218 --> 00:40:25.153
I got one for you.

894
00:40:26.822 --> 00:40:28.222
Bam.
There you go.


895
00:40:28.223 --> 00:40:32.259
There's a nice, juicy
horrible idea for you.


896
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.628
Brooke said no?

897
00:40:33.629 --> 00:40:36.430
Look, I had my life
all planned out with her.


898
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:38.933
All right? I...
It was all perfectly set up.


899
00:40:38.934 --> 00:40:40.167
I had the house,
I had the dog,


900
00:40:40.168 --> 00:40:41.636
I had "Downton Abbey"
on the weekends.


901
00:40:41.637 --> 00:40:43.337
I even did the proposal
on the beach


902
00:40:43.338 --> 00:40:46.340
with bacon and mimosas
and pancakes and all that.


903
00:40:46.341 --> 00:40:47.575
And for whatever reason

904
00:40:47.576 --> 00:40:49.644
that I'll probably never
understand...


905
00:40:49.645 --> 00:40:51.012
She wanted something else.

906
00:40:51.013 --> 00:40:53.147
So I came on this trip
with you fucks


907
00:40:53.148 --> 00:40:55.382
to just try to get on with it.

908
00:40:55.383 --> 00:40:57.785
So I'm gonna be damned
if I'm gonna just let it end


909
00:40:57.786 --> 00:40:59.554
right here and now.

910
00:41:00.388 --> 00:41:01.889
You're right.

911
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.992
You're Goddamn right.

912
00:41:04.993 --> 00:41:07.929
We can't let the train
stop here.


913
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.296
That's right.
No.


914
00:41:09.297 --> 00:41:11.833
We got a Tsunami of dollar bills
to get to, daddy.


915
00:41:11.834 --> 00:41:13.300
Oh, we're on a mission.
Fuck, yeah.


916
00:41:13.301 --> 00:41:16.037
Look, we'll get another M.C.
Right, Tobias?


917
00:41:16.038 --> 00:41:19.173
That's the energy
I'm talking about right there.


918
00:41:19.174 --> 00:41:21.943
Look, we'll pick him up
on the way home.


919
00:41:21.944 --> 00:41:23.945
All we got to do
is get a rental car.


920
00:41:23.946 --> 00:41:27.682
We're not gonna need
a rental car, I don't think.


921
00:41:27.683 --> 00:41:30.618
This is another horrible idea,
but...


922
00:41:30.619 --> 00:41:33.454
I know an M.C. In Savannah.

923
00:41:43.365 --> 00:41:44.465
Gentlemen.
Hey.


924
00:41:44.466 --> 00:41:45.933
How can I be of service?

925
00:41:45.934 --> 00:41:48.269
Uh, is Rome in tonight?

926
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.937
Are you a member, sir?

927
00:41:49.938 --> 00:41:51.372
N-no.
Not a...


928
00:41:51.373 --> 00:41:54.241
No, we're not members.

929
00:41:54.242 --> 00:41:57.344
Uh... I used to...

930
00:41:57.345 --> 00:42:00.982
I used to dance here...
Before it was this.


931
00:42:00.983 --> 00:42:02.950
Can you just do me a favor
and...


932
00:42:02.951 --> 00:42:05.219
Just if you could
get my name to Rome.

933
00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.320
Mike Lane.

934
00:42:06.321 --> 00:42:08.355
And if... and if that doesn't do
the trick,


935
00:42:08.356 --> 00:42:11.693
I guess we'll just stop
bothering you.


936
00:42:15.397 --> 00:42:17.131
You can follow me.

937
00:42:17.132 --> 00:42:19.566
Uh, y'all chill down here.

938
00:42:19.567 --> 00:42:20.936
I'll be back.

939
00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.384
What's up?

940
00:43:16.658 --> 00:43:19.694
Sit your ass down.

941
00:43:24.366 --> 00:43:26.968
Malik, I'm sorry
for the surprise,


942
00:43:26.969 --> 00:43:29.103
but a ghost is a ghost.

943
00:43:29.104 --> 00:43:31.706
I'll see you downstairs
in a minute, okay?


944
00:43:32.808 --> 00:43:35.376
So, they said
"Mike Lane and company."


945
00:43:35.377 --> 00:43:36.911
Mm-hmm.

946
00:43:36.912 --> 00:43:38.846
Who's your company?

947
00:43:38.847 --> 00:43:41.515
It's what's left
of the kings of Tampa.


948
00:43:41.516 --> 00:43:43.117
Oh, let me guess.

949
00:43:43.118 --> 00:43:47.188
Mr. Crocodile Dundee
done did a little Houdini act?


950
00:43:47.189 --> 00:43:49.456
Yep.

951
00:43:49.457 --> 00:43:51.827
Mm-hmm.
Seems so.


952
00:43:53.295 --> 00:43:54.929
Just so you know,

953
00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:58.565
I got out on my own accord
three years ago.


954
00:43:58.566 --> 00:44:01.469
But yet here you are.

955
00:44:03.071 --> 00:44:05.739
You got my curiosity, Mike.

956
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.843
Floor is yours.

957
00:44:09.111 --> 00:44:10.311
No.

958
00:44:10.312 --> 00:44:12.146
I was just in the neighborhood
and wanted to see


959
00:44:12.147 --> 00:44:14.949
if I could stop by and borrow
a cup of brown sugar.


960
00:44:16.284 --> 00:44:19.753
Boy, I tell you,
shit don't change, huh?


961
00:44:19.754 --> 00:44:21.255
Always got to lead with a joke

962
00:44:21.256 --> 00:44:23.290
before you ask
for what you want.


963
00:44:23.291 --> 00:44:24.893
No.

964
00:44:26.895 --> 00:44:28.462
So, what did you do,

965
00:44:28.463 --> 00:44:31.833
turn this place into some sort
of a country club or something?


966
00:44:31.834 --> 00:44:33.267
Guess you could say that.

967
00:44:33.268 --> 00:44:35.970
You know, back in the day
in the Roman empire,


968
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:38.739
as long as you paid the emperor
your taxes,


969
00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.207
you could worship
who you wanted,


970
00:44:40.208 --> 00:44:42.009
where you wanted,
how you wanted.


971
00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:44.411
Freedom had a small price.

972
00:44:44.412 --> 00:44:47.514
Do you know what people value
more than freedom, Mike?


973
00:44:47.515 --> 00:44:49.116
Please say strippers.

974
00:44:49.117 --> 00:44:49.918
Nope.

975
00:44:49.919 --> 00:44:51.819
Beauty.

976
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:55.789
So, if beauty is something
you really wish to behold,


977
00:44:55.790 --> 00:45:00.061
you can behold all the beauty
you want right here.


978
00:45:00.062 --> 00:45:03.831
All I ask is for
a little monthly fee, you know?


979
00:45:05.333 --> 00:45:11.305
So it's a subscription-based
pleasure that you're selling?


980
00:45:11.306 --> 00:45:13.041
You got it.

981
00:45:15.043 --> 00:45:17.478
Why don't you let me
show you around?


982
00:45:17.479 --> 00:45:18.579
See what we do here.

983
00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.814
Maybe you'll learn
a little something.

00:49:33.034 --> 00:49:34.535
Just beautiful.

1054
00:49:34.536 --> 00:49:37.738
All right, ladies,
you having a good time tonight?


1055
00:49:40.475 --> 00:49:42.476
That's what I thought.

1056
00:49:42.477 --> 00:49:45.646
But you know there's always
a queen up in here


1057
00:49:45.647 --> 00:49:49.350
who must be reminded
of how beautiful she is.


1058
00:49:49.351 --> 00:49:51.252
Don't be shy.
Where you at?


1059
00:49:51.253 --> 00:49:54.054
Oop!
Boom.


1060
00:49:54.055 --> 00:49:55.956
There you go.

1061
00:49:55.957 --> 00:49:58.092
Give me your hand.

1062
00:49:59.261 --> 00:50:02.163
Do you know how beautiful
you are?


1063
00:50:02.164 --> 00:50:03.897
Queens, ain't she beautiful?

1064
00:50:06.668 --> 00:50:08.635
You hear that?
But you know what?


1065
00:50:08.636 --> 00:50:10.537
If you're not gonna take
our word for it,


1066
00:50:10.538 --> 00:50:13.407
we're just gonna show you, okay?

1067
00:50:13.408 --> 00:50:20.481
So let me present to you
the absolutely adorable...


1068
00:50:20.482 --> 00:50:21.748
Andre.

1069
00:50:23.318 --> 00:50:25.153
What's your name?

1070
00:50:26.288 --> 00:50:28.355
Caroline.

1071
00:50:28.356 --> 00:50:30.791
Don't be shy.
That's a beautiful name.


1072
00:50:30.792 --> 00:50:32.893
It was my grandmother's.

1073
00:50:32.894 --> 00:50:34.295
What did she do?

1074
00:50:34.296 --> 00:50:38.299
Um, she was the first female
black grocery owner


1075
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.300
in the state.

1076
00:50:39.301 --> 00:50:40.667
Mm.
A strong woman.


1077
00:50:40.668 --> 00:50:44.137
What brings you to Domina?
Other than the obvious.


1078
00:50:44.138 --> 00:50:46.006
Celebrating my divorce.

1079
00:50:46.007 --> 00:50:48.475
Your girlfriends brought you out
to have a good time, huh?


1080
00:50:48.476 --> 00:50:50.110
Whoo! Yeah.
Good job. Okay.


1081
00:50:50.111 --> 00:50:51.545
I'll take it from here.

1082
00:50:51.546 --> 00:50:54.481
Uh, Caroline,
would you mind...


1083
00:50:54.482 --> 00:50:56.883
Sitting for me right here?

1084
00:50:56.884 --> 00:50:58.485
That would be great.

1085
00:50:58.486 --> 00:51:00.721
And, um,
one last thing...


1086
00:51:00.722 --> 00:51:03.924
What's your favorite thing?

1087
00:51:03.925 --> 00:51:05.058
Alcohol.

1088
00:51:05.059 --> 00:51:06.327
Alcohol.

1089
00:51:06.328 --> 00:51:08.395
Okay.
Alcohol.


1090
00:51:08.396 --> 00:51:11.298
Um, I'm gonna need some
crowd participation on this one,


1091
00:51:11.299 --> 00:51:12.833
so just, uh,
follow my lead.


1092
00:51:12.834 --> 00:51:15.068
Yeah.

1093
00:51:15.069 --> 00:51:17.103
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1094
00:51:17.104 --> 00:51:18.605
Okay.

1095
00:51:18.606 --> 00:51:21.443
Mm.

1096
00:51:22.944 --> 00:51:25.679
Young Caroline,
give a Nigga happy time.


1097
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.014
She like alcohol, but you ain't
here to hear me whine.


1098
00:51:28.015 --> 00:51:30.817
I'm looking at your backside.
I'm trying to stay patient.


1099
00:51:30.818 --> 00:51:33.554
Make that thing clap.
That's a standing ovation.


1100
00:51:33.555 --> 00:51:35.756
Grandma independent.
She don't need your help.


1101
00:51:35.757 --> 00:51:38.959
But you don't really feel
that way about yourself.


1102
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.262
That's why the name feel funny
in your mouth.


1103
00:51:41.263 --> 00:51:42.929
You don't believe it,
but I can see it.


1104
00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:44.965
And fuck that dude.
He don't get you.


1105
00:51:44.966 --> 00:51:46.833
I know you're cool
and I just met you.


1106
00:51:46.834 --> 00:51:48.101
Pick you up around 8:00.

1107
00:51:48.102 --> 00:51:49.503
I can come and get you.

1108
00:51:49.504 --> 00:51:51.204
On the coast,
and we ballin' back and forth


1109
00:51:51.205 --> 00:51:53.507
like it's ping-pong
and you ain't got a thing on.


1110
00:51:53.508 --> 00:51:55.175

Why are you here?

1126
00:53:01.409 --> 00:53:02.776
I don't know.

1127
00:53:02.777 --> 00:53:07.682
Me and the guys were, uh...
We were near Savannah.


1128
00:53:08.683 --> 00:53:11.052
And I couldn't not see you.

1129
00:53:15.657 --> 00:53:17.359
Okay.

1130
00:53:18.726 --> 00:53:20.061
And?

1131
00:53:21.262 --> 00:53:22.796
Don't laugh.

1132
00:53:22.797 --> 00:53:26.032
Uh, we're going up to the
convention and... I don't know.


1133
00:53:26.033 --> 00:53:29.937
We're gonna have one crazy night
to put this in bed and...


1134
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.377
I don't know.
I just thought it could be fun.


1135
00:53:36.578 --> 00:53:38.679
The convention?

1136
00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.782
So you mean to tell me you came
all the way here to see me


1137
00:53:41.783 --> 00:53:43.717
about that bullshit convention?

1138
00:53:43.718 --> 00:53:45.786
No.
Look... look, I know.


1139
00:53:45.787 --> 00:53:50.357
I just thought it...
Presented itself as an...


1140
00:53:50.358 --> 00:53:52.559
As an interesting opportunity
for us to...


1141
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.227
No, no, no, no.
No.


1142
00:53:54.228 --> 00:53:56.029
For you maybe.

1143
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:58.399
What the hell do I need
a convention for, Mike?


1144
00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.233
You don't.
That's not what I'm saying.


1145
00:54:00.234 --> 00:54:02.903
Would you let me finish, please?
Will you just... no. Unh-Unh. No.


1146
00:54:02.904 --> 00:54:04.605
I haven't talked to you
for eight years


1147
00:54:04.606 --> 00:54:07.040
since you walked out on me.
Oh, did I walk out on you?


1148
00:54:07.041 --> 00:54:09.976
Because if I remember correctly,
I went and took a job.


1149
00:54:09.977 --> 00:54:12.613
And when I came back, someone
wouldn't let me in the house.


1150
00:54:12.614 --> 00:54:15.549
Mike, what makes you think
that you can come up in here


1151
00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:17.684
after all this time
and snap your fingers


1152
00:54:17.685 --> 00:54:20.654
and I'm supposed to do a favor
for you?


1153
00:54:20.655 --> 00:54:22.089
Okay.

1154
00:54:24.392 --> 00:54:28.194
Maybe... I'm... I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry.


1155
00:54:28.195 --> 00:54:32.098
I-I'm not saying that
at all.


1156
00:54:32.099 --> 00:54:33.434
Really?

1157
00:54:33.435 --> 00:54:36.537
I don't need a favor from you.

1158
00:54:36.538 --> 00:54:38.972
Fuck the convention.

1159
00:54:38.973 --> 00:54:43.043
Don't...
All it is is an excuse


1160
00:54:43.044 --> 00:54:46.980
for us to try to put
this shit between us to bed.


1161
00:54:46.981 --> 00:54:49.884
That's all.

1162
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.069
Oh, shit.

1163
00:55:12.273 --> 00:55:14.407
Thank you, Octavius.

1164
00:55:14.408 --> 00:55:16.977
Ooh.
You're wonderful.


1165
00:55:16.978 --> 00:55:19.245
My queens, gather.

1166
00:55:19.246 --> 00:55:22.649
I need you.
I need you.


1167
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:25.752
You ever had a ghost
come to your front door?


1168
00:55:25.753 --> 00:55:29.289
A ghost from your past,
one that still makes you shiver?


1169
00:55:31.358 --> 00:55:33.560
I had one today.

1170
00:55:33.561 --> 00:55:36.029
So I need your help.

1171
00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:38.865
I need you
to help me make a decision


1172
00:55:38.866 --> 00:55:42.135
of whether I should leave
that ghost in his grave


1173
00:55:42.136 --> 00:55:45.271
or give him an opportunity
to be resurrected.


1174
00:55:45.272 --> 00:55:47.207
Resurrected!

1175
00:55:47.208 --> 00:55:49.109
Okay.

1176
00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.612
I got a little treat for y'all
tonight.


1177
00:55:51.613 --> 00:55:58.051
It's a man I knew...
As white chocolate.


1178
00:56:01.556 --> 00:56:05.726
Some might know him
as Magic Mike.


1179
00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:12.298
We're gonna see if he's still
got some magic in that Mike.


1180
00:56:19.406 --> 00:56:21.708
Hello, beautiful.

1181
00:56:21.709 --> 00:56:23.810
You down for a little fun
tonight?


1182
00:56:23.811 --> 00:56:25.646
Yes.
All right.


1183
00:56:25.647 --> 00:56:28.082
Have a seat.

1184
00:56:29.216 --> 00:56:30.684
Mike?

1185
00:56:30.685 --> 00:56:32.953
Come on.
Let's not do this.


1186
00:56:32.954 --> 00:56:34.888
Uh...

1187
00:56:34.889 --> 00:56:36.623
Mnh-mnh.

1188
00:56:36.624 --> 00:56:37.624

So, seeing as though
you are leaving again...


1241
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:31.865
I have Andre over here
to take care of you.


1242
00:59:31.866 --> 00:59:33.533
He'll take you
wherever you want to go.


1243
00:59:33.534 --> 00:59:36.704
Yeah.
We got to get on the road.


1244
00:59:39.273 --> 00:59:41.775
This was, uh,
this was fun...


1245
00:59:41.776 --> 00:59:45.279
Whatever, I guess,
that this was.


1246
00:59:47.882 --> 00:59:49.750
It was good seeing you.

1247
00:59:49.751 --> 00:59:50.984
Likewise.

1248
00:59:50.985 --> 00:59:54.955
So... what was that?

1249
00:59:54.956 --> 00:59:57.457
Y'all used to dance together?

1250
00:59:57.458 --> 00:59:58.825
Uh, yeah.

1251
00:59:58.826 --> 01:00:00.526
Look, it's a...

1252
01:00:00.527 --> 01:00:04.264
It's a long, long story, but,
uh, Rome and I met each other


1253
01:00:04.265 --> 01:00:06.499
at a very interesting time
in our lives,


1254
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.870
and... and, uh, I guess you
could say that we had a thing.


1255
01:00:09.871 --> 01:00:13.173
Mm. Yeah.
I'd say you had a thing.


1256
01:00:13.174 --> 01:00:14.407
Yeah.

1257
01:00:14.408 --> 01:00:18.511
Well, until I, uh,
I went to work with Dallas.


1258
01:00:18.512 --> 01:00:20.113
Yeah.

1259
01:00:20.114 --> 01:00:23.917
So... is she gonna come help us
or what?


1260
01:00:23.918 --> 01:00:25.518
No.
No.


1261
01:00:25.519 --> 01:00:28.054
I don't... I don't think
that's gonna actually happen.


1262
01:00:28.055 --> 01:00:30.623
Rome likes to stay
in her castle.


1263
01:00:30.624 --> 01:00:32.993
That's why she built it.

1264
01:00:32.994 --> 01:00:36.429
So, uh, I getting on 95 north,
right?


1265
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:39.833
Yeah. Yeah.
It's just outside of Charleston.


1266
01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:41.968
She texted me the address.
I don't know.


1267
01:00:41.969 --> 01:00:43.870
I'll tell you
when we get closer.


1268
01:00:43.871 --> 01:00:45.671
You need a co-pilot?
Yes, please.


1269
01:00:45.672 --> 01:00:47.974
Okay.

1270
01:00:47.975 --> 01:00:50.376
That was insane tonight, man.

1271
01:00:50.377 --> 01:00:53.013
Thanks. I'm serious, dude.
That was like...


1272
01:00:53.014 --> 01:00:54.848
It was a good night.
I'm not gonna lie to you.


1273
01:00:54.849 --> 01:00:56.349
Your stuff is revolutionary,
man.


1274
01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:58.051
Sometimes the songs
are a little...


1275
01:00:58.052 --> 01:01:00.086
No, man. It was perfect.
Are you kidding me?


1276
01:01:00.087 --> 01:01:02.522
I appreciate that. And you
just made that up on the spot.


1277
01:01:02.523 --> 01:01:05.358
I... well, Rome likes us
to put our passion in our work.


1278
01:01:05.359 --> 01:01:06.359
Well, it shows, man.

1279
01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.461
I've never seen anything
like that.


1280
01:01:08.462 --> 01:01:11.331
Are you doing anything else
with your music?


1281
01:01:11.332 --> 01:01:13.633
Man, I'm trying.
I put it up online.


1282
01:01:13.634 --> 01:01:16.469
Hopefully, like, it'll spread
through social media,


1283
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:19.439
but honestly, with this E.P.
That's coming out, it's...


1284
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.706
Oh, cool, man.

1285
01:01:20.707 --> 01:01:22.775
It's hard to get people
to pay attention to it.


1286
01:01:22.776 --> 01:01:26.079
'Cause there's so much shit that comes
on the Internet every day. Oh. So much.


1287
01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.780
I just want to stay authentic.

1288
01:01:27.781 --> 01:01:29.983
Yeah. Well,
at least you're trying, man.


1289
01:01:29.984 --> 01:01:31.484
At least you're trying.

1290
01:01:31.485 --> 01:01:33.786
That's why I moved
down to Florida back in the day,


1291
01:01:33.787 --> 01:01:35.155
actually,
was to do music stuff.


1292
01:01:35.156 --> 01:01:36.923
Really?
Yeah. Yeah.


1293
01:01:36.924 --> 01:01:38.724
I sang
in "Dream along with Mickey"


1294
01:01:38.725 --> 01:01:40.426
at Disney world from '03 to '05.

1295
01:01:40.427 --> 01:01:41.661
What?

1296
01:01:41.662 --> 01:01:43.063
Yeah, man.
For real.


1297
01:01:43.064 --> 01:01:44.697
I mean, I started out
as the Donald duck understudy,


1298
01:01:44.698 --> 01:01:47.901
but I... I was playing Mickey
by my second year.


1299
01:01:47.902 --> 01:01:50.303
I got signed by an agent,

1300
01:01:50.304 --> 01:01:53.106
booked a couple
regional commercial spots.


1301
01:01:53.107 --> 01:01:55.909
And one day I heard an ad on
the radio looking for dancers.


1302
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:57.844
And you know how that shit goes,
so...


1303
01:01:57.845 --> 01:02:00.546
When I started this,
I thought...


1304
01:02:00.547 --> 01:02:02.515
Man, I thought I'd hate it.

1305
01:02:02.516 --> 01:02:06.352
But now, if the... if, like,
the E.P. Blew up tomorrow,


1306
01:02:06.353 --> 01:02:08.855
I'd probably still do this
on the side.


1307
01:02:08.856 --> 01:02:09.856
What?
I'm serious.


1308
01:02:09.857 --> 01:02:11.157
You're shitting me.

1309
01:02:11.158 --> 01:02:14.160
Do you see how many girls I meet
every day?


1310
01:02:14.161 --> 01:02:15.929
Yes.
For free?


1311
01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.730
For free!
I don't got to pay for...


1312
01:02:17.731 --> 01:02:18.731
All I do is sing.

1313
01:02:18.732 --> 01:02:20.266
And you think about that.

1314
01:02:20.267 --> 01:02:23.469
Like, these girls have to deal
with men in their lives


1315
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:26.006
every day who...
They don't listen to them.


1316
01:02:26.007 --> 01:02:27.573
They don't ask them
what they want.


1317
01:02:27.574 --> 01:02:29.509
They don't even ask them
what they want.


1318
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:31.677
All we got to do is ask them
what they want.


1319
01:02:31.678 --> 01:02:33.713
And when they tell you,
it's a beautiful thing, man.


1320
01:02:33.714 --> 01:02:37.783
It's like we're like...
We're like healers or something.


1321
01:02:37.784 --> 01:02:39.886
Yes, man.

1322
01:02:39.887 --> 01:02:41.187
Fuck, yes.
We are.


1323
01:02:41.188 --> 01:02:42.923
That's right.
We're healers.


1324
01:02:42.924 --> 01:02:44.590
We're healers, man.

1325
01:02:44.591 --> 01:02:46.659
We can be.
Okay. Yeah. We can be.


1326
01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.428
We can be.

1327
01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:49.429
Okay.
I like that.


1328
01:03:13.254 --> 01:03:15.155
Hey, thanks for the ride.
No problem, man.


1329
01:03:15.156 --> 01:03:17.023
Good talking to you, man.
Safe home.


1330
01:03:17.024 --> 01:03:18.491
Look us up
when you get back.


1331
01:03:18.492 --> 01:03:19.960
All right, man.
Thanks, man.


1332
01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:21.627
You sure this is the place?

1333
01:03:21.628 --> 01:03:24.364
Yeah. I'm positive.
She said it, and I got the text.


1334
01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:27.600
Looks like somebody hooked up
with a trust fund baby! You know?


1335
01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:30.036
I just hit her
with her favorite flavor, baby,


1336
01:03:30.037 --> 01:03:31.671
and we're livin' large.

1337
01:03:31.672 --> 01:03:33.975
Megan?

1338
01:03:35.042 --> 01:03:36.977
Hello?

1339
01:03:36.978 --> 01:03:39.212
Megan?

1340
01:03:39.213 --> 01:03:41.381
There's some law of attraction
going on up in here.


1341
01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:42.983
There's somebody in here.
Megan!


1342
01:03:42.984 --> 01:03:43.984
It's Tito!

1343
01:03:43.985 --> 01:03:45.651
Hey!

1344
01:03:45.652 --> 01:03:48.588
Oh... shit.

1345
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:50.190
Who are you?

1346
01:03:50.191 --> 01:03:53.859
Just, uh,
friends of Megan.


1347
01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:55.628
Ah.

1348
01:03:55.629 --> 01:03:57.263
Is Megan here?

1349
01:03:57.264 --> 01:04:00.533
My daughter and her friends
are outside.


1350
01:04:00.534 --> 01:04:01.701
Who are you?

1351
01:04:01.702 --> 01:04:03.569
Oh, you're having a party.
We'll just go out...


1352
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:05.571
You said Megan was back this way
in the guesthouse?


1353
01:04:05.572 --> 01:04:06.839
You hold on.

1354
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.809
Y'all can't just walk
in my house like strangers


1355
01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:11.777
without having a hello drink.

1356
01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.116
You come on now
and have a seat.


1357
01:04:16.117 --> 01:04:18.985
What you want?
You want red? You want white?


1358
01:04:18.986 --> 01:04:21.121
We got whiskey.
We got shine.


1359
01:04:21.122 --> 01:04:23.456
Y'all get something.

1360
01:04:23.457 --> 01:04:27.027
How about we start with wine
and end with shine?


1361
01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:28.561
I like that rule.

1362
01:04:28.562 --> 01:04:30.830
Honey, you come sit right here.
Come on.


1363
01:04:30.831 --> 01:04:33.133
Oh, shit!

1364
01:04:33.134 --> 01:04:34.667
Thank you so much.

1365
01:04:34.668 --> 01:04:35.768
It smells good.

1366
01:04:35.769 --> 01:04:38.038
Well... cheers!

1367
01:04:38.039 --> 01:04:40.273
Cheers. Cheers. Eye contact.

1368
01:04:40.274 --> 01:04:42.808
Thank you for your hospitality,
Ma'am.


1369
01:04:42.809 --> 01:04:44.210
Quit that proper shit.

1370
01:04:45.246 --> 01:04:47.347
You sound just like my ex.

1371
01:04:47.348 --> 01:04:49.849
What are your names?

1372
01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:51.351
Uh, I'm Mike.
This is Tito...


1373
01:04:51.352 --> 01:04:52.352
Tito.
...Ken...


1374
01:04:52.353 --> 01:04:54.020
Ken.
...Richie,


1375
01:04:54.021 --> 01:04:56.190
uh...

1376
01:04:58.459 --> 01:05:00.226
Ernest.
...Ernest. Ernest.


1377
01:05:00.227 --> 01:05:01.627
Well, I'm Nancy.

1378
01:05:01.628 --> 01:05:06.232
And this is Mae, Julia,
Diane, and Jessica.


1379
01:05:06.233 --> 01:05:07.667
Hey.
Nice to meet you.


1380
01:05:07.668 --> 01:05:09.702
Nice to meet y'all.
Thank you, ladies.


1381
01:05:09.703 --> 01:05:12.072
Y'all don't look like
you're from around here.


1382
01:05:12.073 --> 01:05:14.974
We're from Miami.
Uh, just...


1383
01:05:14.975 --> 01:05:18.178
Florida.

1384
01:05:18.179 --> 01:05:19.845
There's one in Ohio, dude.

1385
01:05:19.846 --> 01:05:22.682
Just passing through
on our way to myrtle beach.


1386
01:05:22.683 --> 01:05:25.318
Oh! Myrtle beach!
Redneck Riviera.


1387
01:05:25.319 --> 01:05:27.653
Y'all should try kiawah instead.

1388
01:05:27.654 --> 01:05:29.455
Oh, yeah, I heard
that's real nice, ma'am.


1389
01:05:29.456 --> 01:05:31.491
"Oh, yeah, I heard
that's real nice, ma'am."


1390
01:05:32.593 --> 01:05:34.094
Listen to him!

1391
01:05:34.095 --> 01:05:35.528
Is that what I sound like?

1392
01:05:35.529 --> 01:05:38.231
You're good!

1393
01:05:38.232 --> 01:05:39.765
Don't think I don't know

1394
01:05:39.766 --> 01:05:42.635
what you're doing here
with those girls.


1395
01:05:42.636 --> 01:05:46.339
How do y'all know my daughter?

1396
01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.208
We just...
Uh, we just met her at a...


1397
01:05:48.209 --> 01:05:50.576
At a... in Jacksonville at...
At a...


1398
01:05:50.577 --> 01:05:51.512
It was a bar.

1399
01:05:51.513 --> 01:05:54.080
A bar.
Well, that's my daughter.


1400
01:05:54.081 --> 01:05:56.082
Always making new friends!

1401
01:05:58.352 --> 01:06:00.953
So what do y'all do?

1402
01:06:00.954 --> 01:06:03.189
We are...
I, uh... hey!


1403
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.224
How are you?

1404
01:06:04.225 --> 01:06:05.225
Hey!
Hi!


1405
01:06:05.226 --> 01:06:06.459
There you are.

1406
01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.428
Hey.
What are y'all talking about?


1407
01:06:08.429 --> 01:06:10.230
Oh, the boys
are just about to tell us


1408
01:06:10.231 --> 01:06:12.232
what they do for a living.
Oh.


1409
01:06:12.233 --> 01:06:13.699
Mm-hmm.

1410
01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:16.469
We, uh...

1411
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.804
What do... uh, I have...

1412
01:06:18.805 --> 01:06:20.039
I have my own furniture company.

1413
01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.007
Yeah. He's great.
Um...


1414
01:06:22.008 --> 01:06:25.345
Tito here is into yogurt.

1415
01:06:25.346 --> 01:06:28.381
Frozen yogurt.
Yeah. artisanal.


1416
01:06:28.382 --> 01:06:34.487
Ken is a budding actor and, um,
and level-3 reiki healer.


1417
01:06:34.488 --> 01:06:36.522
Uh, so if you need any work
done...


1418
01:06:36.523 --> 01:06:40.059
Uh, Ernie is...
Is an artist.


1419
01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.327
He's a painter.

1420
01:06:41.328 --> 01:06:43.996
Mom, they're male strippers.

1421
01:06:43.997 --> 01:06:45.798
Now, that makes sense.

1422
01:06:45.799 --> 01:06:48.368
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?


1423
01:06:48.369 --> 01:06:51.737
Because it's fucking awkward
to do somebody like that.


1424
01:06:51.738 --> 01:06:54.740
Enough with that fucking language!

1425
01:06:54.741 --> 01:06:56.642
Oh, God, I don't think
I've ever had


1426
01:06:56.643 --> 01:06:58.711
a real live stripper
in my house before.


1427
01:06:58.712 --> 01:07:00.045
You have now.

1428
01:07:00.046 --> 01:07:02.014
Uh, well, actually,
the... the technical term is...


1429
01:07:02.015 --> 01:07:04.049
Is male entertainer.
Oh, my!


1430
01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:07.086
Mom, they're not here for that.
They're just friends.


1431
01:07:07.087 --> 01:07:08.921
Of course not!

1432
01:07:08.922 --> 01:07:12.558
Shit, Diana, go down
and grab us some more Vino.


1433
01:07:12.559 --> 01:07:14.794
No, no, no.
Don't... don't you worry.


1434
01:07:14.795 --> 01:07:17.630
I got this. I'll reload, Nancy.
Okay, baby.


1435
01:07:17.631 --> 01:07:20.866
You just... you just get
anything that looks expensive.


1436
01:07:20.867 --> 01:07:22.168
As much of the good stuff

1437
01:07:22.169 --> 01:07:23.803
as your little arms can carry,
darling.


1438
01:07:23.804 --> 01:07:25.905
You got it.

1439
01:07:25.906 --> 01:07:28.040
I-I got arms.
I'll help.


1440
01:07:34.014 --> 01:07:36.649
Are you native American, Tito?

1441
01:07:38.185 --> 01:07:41.086
Yes, on my mother's side.

1442
01:07:41.087 --> 01:07:43.556
Really, I've got it.
Thanks, though.


1443
01:07:43.557 --> 01:07:45.491
Oh, you do not have it.

1444
01:07:45.492 --> 01:07:47.627
By what I just saw up there,

1445
01:07:47.628 --> 01:07:51.764
we are gonna need a fucking
pack mule to water that bunch.


1446
01:07:51.765 --> 01:07:53.833
So... I don't know.

1447
01:07:53.834 --> 01:07:55.968
Let's fucking do this.

1448
01:07:55.969 --> 01:07:58.471
I thought you were supposed to
be in New York, by the way.


1449
01:07:58.472 --> 01:08:00.806
Oh, wait.
Is that not where we are?


1450
01:08:00.807 --> 01:08:02.409
Wow.

1451
01:08:03.944 --> 01:08:06.279
Hmm?

1452
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.415
I changed my mind.

1453
01:08:09.716 --> 01:08:11.617
So does that mean
you are gonna be on the pole


1454
01:08:11.618 --> 01:08:13.219
or you're not gonna be
on the pole?


1455
01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.654
Because, I mean,

1456
01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:16.689
"Dolly Titz on the main stage,
coming up for you, boys.


1457
01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:19.259
Get your dollar bills out
and let's brighten up her day"


1458
01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:21.561
sounds awesome to me.

1459
01:08:21.562 --> 01:08:22.895
Ha ha.

1460
01:08:22.896 --> 01:08:25.431
Nice callback, Clitoria.

1461
01:08:25.432 --> 01:08:28.268
It's low-hanging fruit.
I can't help myself.


1462
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:29.969
What's the plan now, then?

1463
01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:32.037
Currently?
Yep.


1464
01:08:32.038 --> 01:08:35.908
Find the perfect dynamite
for that powder keg upstairs


1465
01:08:35.909 --> 01:08:39.211
and... watch it blow.

1466
01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:41.113
Okay.

1467
01:08:41.114 --> 01:08:42.715
What are we looking for?

1468
01:08:42.716 --> 01:08:47.920
Something old and expensive...
To fit in upstairs.


1469
01:08:47.921 --> 01:08:49.590
Cool.

1470
01:08:50.624 --> 01:08:52.792
They all look the same to me.

1471
01:08:52.793 --> 01:08:54.895
Racist.

1472
01:08:56.029 --> 01:08:58.230
Hmm?

1473
01:08:58.231 --> 01:09:01.834
1959 Château Lafite.

1474
01:09:01.835 --> 01:09:02.703
That'll do.

1475
01:09:02.704 --> 01:09:04.069
You see, what I hear

1476
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:08.441
is that guy isn't taking care
of his own shit.


1477
01:09:08.442 --> 01:09:10.910
How are you gonna expect
your lady to trim the hedges,


1478
01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:14.847
if you're not willing to...
Prune the tree?


1479
01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:19.819
See, I have a three-day
Max-Growth rule.


1480
01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.688
- Really?
- Abso-fucking-lutely, ma'am.


1481
01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:23.689
Wow.

1482
01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:25.791
Pardon my language.
Oh, please.


1483
01:09:25.792 --> 01:09:27.126
We got wine!

1484
01:09:28.562 --> 01:09:29.629
A basket full of wine!

1485
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:31.230
We got a basket of wine.

1486
01:09:31.231 --> 01:09:34.600
You are missing out
on some husband tales in here.


1487
01:09:34.601 --> 01:09:36.001
Or ex-husband tales.

1488
01:09:36.002 --> 01:09:38.137
Julia and I are trying to lure
Mae and Diana


1489
01:09:38.138 --> 01:09:40.239
over to the dark side.

1490
01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.508
Use the force, Nance.

1491
01:09:42.509 --> 01:09:44.577
Come on, Mae.

1492
01:09:44.578 --> 01:09:46.312
It's your turn.

1493
01:09:46.313 --> 01:09:48.514
Come on, Mae.

1494
01:09:48.515 --> 01:09:50.149
Come on, Mae.

1495
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:54.086
We know it ain't all peaches
and roses in that bedroom.


1496
01:09:54.087 --> 01:09:56.121
Cone of silence here.

1497
01:09:56.122 --> 01:09:59.158
Fine.
I'll go, then.


1498
01:09:59.159 --> 01:10:01.827
Ugh.
Here's a whopper for you.


1499
01:10:01.828 --> 01:10:02.995
Here we go.

1500
01:10:02.996 --> 01:10:05.998
Roger's the only man
I've ever slept with.


1501
01:10:05.999 --> 01:10:08.200
Then you are gonna get
more wine.


1502
01:10:10.303 --> 01:10:11.971
Yeah.

1503
01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:16.676
I lost my virginity to him when
I was 17, and that was that.


1504
01:10:16.677 --> 01:10:18.711
Two beautiful daughters,

1505
01:10:18.712 --> 01:10:22.682
but only one penis
my entire fucking life.


1506
01:10:22.683 --> 01:10:28.120
Sadly, I was too naive to
recognize that he was a gay man.


1507
01:10:28.121 --> 01:10:30.089
Mom,
you don't know that.


1508
01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:31.457
Oh, I knew enough.

1509
01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:32.925
I knew he really liked it
when I put my fing...


1510
01:10:32.926 --> 01:10:34.627
Mom! No. I don't want to hear that.
Hey!


1511
01:10:34.628 --> 01:10:36.729
Well, you need to hear this!
It's not so terrible.


1512
01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:40.032
Because I pissed away
all of this on one man.


1513
01:10:40.033 --> 01:10:42.835
And you are not gonna make
the same mistake.


1514
01:10:42.836 --> 01:10:44.103
Got it.

1515
01:10:44.104 --> 01:10:48.741
That's why I tell these girls
to play the field.


1516
01:10:48.742 --> 01:10:52.044
And don't stop
until you find one


1517
01:10:52.045 --> 01:10:55.648
that rocks
your fucking socks off!


1518
01:10:55.649 --> 01:10:57.349
My Motto.
Hear, hear.


1519
01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:00.986
Well, you know, Nancy,
that plays both ways.


1520
01:11:00.987 --> 01:11:05.024
I think I've had
as good a run as anybody.


1521
01:11:05.025 --> 01:11:06.792
But I'd trade all that
in a heartbeat


1522
01:11:06.793 --> 01:11:10.963
to come home to a wife, a kid,
people that love me.


1523
01:11:10.964 --> 01:11:15.234
That hole is never
gonna be filled.


1524
01:11:15.235 --> 01:11:17.704
That ship fucking sailed.

1525
01:11:20.674 --> 01:11:22.942
Wow.

1526
01:11:22.943 --> 01:11:25.478
I think my soul just died
a little bit.


1527
01:11:25.479 --> 01:11:27.780
I love you, Ernie.

1528
01:11:27.781 --> 01:11:31.150
Well, Hank and I have never had
sex with the lights on.


1529
01:11:31.151 --> 01:11:32.752
What?

1530
01:11:32.753 --> 01:11:35.655
Every time it starts,
he just goes and turns 'em off.


1531
01:11:35.656 --> 01:11:39.459
And I try to drop hints,
but, um...


1532
01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.661
Maybe it's me.
I don't know.


1533
01:11:41.662 --> 01:11:44.129
Come on. Never once?

1534
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:45.998
Never.

1535
01:11:45.999 --> 01:11:48.468
He's not showing you
how beautiful you are.


1536
01:11:48.469 --> 01:11:50.369
No. You're gorgeous...
You know that, right?


1537
01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:51.637
She's gorgeous, right?

1538
01:11:51.638 --> 01:11:53.539
And I'm not just talking
about the paint job.


1539
01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.407
I'm not talking about
this vessel.


1540
01:11:55.408 --> 01:11:57.342
I'm talking about
what's inside you.


1541
01:11:57.343 --> 01:11:58.911
I read energy in my work,

1542
01:11:58.912 --> 01:12:06.085
and... and yours is pure and
sweet and loving and nurturing.


1543
01:12:06.086 --> 01:12:07.020
You got to talk to him.

1544
01:12:07.021 --> 01:12:08.588
'Cause if he's not gonna
worship you,


1545
01:12:08.589 --> 01:12:09.789
there's a lot of guys out there
who will.


1546
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:11.557
And the line starts right here.

1547
01:12:11.558 --> 01:12:13.092
Winds around this room, too.
Yep. Absolutely.


1548
01:12:13.093 --> 01:12:14.259
You know that, right?

1549
01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:17.196
Good. Don't... no, no.
Don't get shy on me.


1550
01:12:17.197 --> 01:12:19.298
You need to say it.
I want to hear you say it.


1551
01:12:19.299 --> 01:12:21.601
Own it.

1552
01:12:21.602 --> 01:12:24.203
Well, I just don't know
what to say to him.


1553
01:12:24.204 --> 01:12:26.071
Well, tell him
what your fantasy is.


1554
01:12:26.072 --> 01:12:28.207
And make sure he does it
with the lights on.


1555
01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:32.077
If he doesn't, then y'all have
a serious problem.


1556
01:12:32.078 --> 01:12:34.279
Well, I, um...

1557
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.182
When we were in college
and we were falling in love,


1558
01:12:37.183 --> 01:12:41.086
we used to listen to that song,
um, "heaven."


1559
01:12:41.087 --> 01:12:43.422
Oh, shit.
Yes!


1560
01:12:43.423 --> 01:12:45.224

Yeah, baby.
Whoo!


1578
01:13:42.783 --> 01:13:44.083
That's wonderful!

1579
01:13:44.084 --> 01:13:46.619
I don't think
Hank can do that.


1580
01:13:48.388 --> 01:13:50.055
Doctor's in the house,
baby.


1581
01:13:50.056 --> 01:13:53.058
The doctor has checked
into the building.


1582
01:13:53.059 --> 01:13:54.459
Oh, thank you.

1583
01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:56.762
Yeah!
Fuck, Ken!


1584
01:13:56.763 --> 01:13:58.564
What the fuck?

1585
01:13:58.565 --> 01:14:00.666
Y'all know
that was my audition song.


1586
01:14:00.667 --> 01:14:02.568
What?
Yeah, it was one of them.


1587
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:06.772
It's awesome.

1588
01:14:06.773 --> 01:14:11.443
Oh, God,
I just love this fucking night!


1589
01:14:11.444 --> 01:14:14.046
I love it!

1590
01:14:14.047 --> 01:14:18.217
I wish we had known you guys
back in our day, you know?


1591
01:14:18.218 --> 01:14:21.621
Well, I'd say
it's still your day, ma'am.


1592
01:14:23.556 --> 01:14:25.726
Thank you, Richie.

1593
01:14:28.328 --> 01:14:30.162
Stand up.

1594
01:14:30.163 --> 01:14:33.032
- Oh, no.
- Come on, stand up.


1595
01:14:33.033 --> 01:14:34.099
Hey!

1596
01:14:37.638 --> 01:14:39.839
Oh, my God.
Just look at you.


1597
01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.041
You are just perfect.

1598
01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:43.275
Damn!

1599
01:14:45.445 --> 01:14:46.846
Oh, God.

1600
01:14:46.847 --> 01:14:48.380
- Oh, damn, look at you.
- Here it comes.


1601
01:14:48.381 --> 01:14:51.350
I hate to be rude, but...

1602
01:14:51.351 --> 01:14:52.618
You want to pop the hood.

1603
01:14:56.657 --> 01:14:59.591
Oh, shit.

1604
01:14:59.592 --> 01:15:01.426
Oh, my God!

1605
01:15:01.427 --> 01:15:03.796
- Mom!
- Oh, please!


1606
01:15:03.797 --> 01:15:06.265
Of course you're...
You're eating cake by yourself


1607
01:15:06.266 --> 01:15:08.834
when, uh, the fireworks
are about to go off in there.


1608
01:15:08.835 --> 01:15:10.569
This isn't concerning at all.

1609
01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:12.537
What can I say?

1610
01:15:12.538 --> 01:15:14.406
I like cake.

1611
01:15:14.407 --> 01:15:18.077
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?


1612
01:15:18.078 --> 01:15:20.045
A lady is about to get...

1613
01:15:20.046 --> 01:15:22.381
I don't even know
how to put it into words.


1614
01:15:22.382 --> 01:15:24.283
No.
I'm a cookie guy.


1615
01:15:24.284 --> 01:15:25.751
What?

1616
01:15:25.752 --> 01:15:28.353
Yeah.
It's red fucking velvet.


1617
01:15:28.354 --> 01:15:30.923
I would take a pack of oreos
over that bullshit


1618
01:15:30.924 --> 01:15:32.825
any day of the week.
What's wrong with you?


1619
01:15:32.826 --> 01:15:34.326
Nothing's wrong.
'Cause cookies are awesome.


1620
01:15:34.327 --> 01:15:36.228
Well, I don't think
we have anything more


1621
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:37.562
to say to one another.

1622
01:15:37.563 --> 01:15:39.865
Look, if you don't want to talk
about it or whatever...


1623
01:15:39.866 --> 01:15:41.166
I don't know
if it's about New York...


1624
01:15:41.167 --> 01:15:43.068
But I maybe intuit
that it might be...


1625
01:15:43.069 --> 01:15:46.071
I'm gonna start hiding
the kitchen knives in a minute.


1626
01:15:46.072 --> 01:15:48.340
Seriously, it is that obvious.

1627
01:15:48.341 --> 01:15:50.643
What's up?

1628
01:15:52.078 --> 01:15:56.849
I met a photographer in Miami
at this party I was working at.


1629
01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:59.651
He was nice and married
and all of that.


1630
01:15:59.652 --> 01:16:00.953
Mm.

1631
01:16:00.954 --> 01:16:05.457
Took a look at my photos
and said I had an eye.


1632
01:16:05.458 --> 01:16:08.761
Offered me a job right there
on the spot as his assistant.


1633
01:16:08.762 --> 01:16:10.162
That's cool.

1634
01:16:10.163 --> 01:16:12.631
I mean, did he offer a place
for you to stay as well


1635
01:16:12.632 --> 01:16:15.534
that happened to be his house
when his wife was away?


1636
01:16:15.535 --> 01:16:16.668
That...

1637
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:18.370
Yeah.

1638
01:16:18.371 --> 01:16:19.772
Wait.
Were you there?


1639
01:16:19.773 --> 01:16:22.241
I was there, but I was in drag.
You wouldn't have recognized me.


1640
01:16:22.242 --> 01:16:26.145
Mm. But I just want to throw
this out there, though.


1641
01:16:26.146 --> 01:16:27.579
Um, this might be God's way

1642
01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.449
of giving you a second chance
at Myrtle Beach.


1643
01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.051
Mm.

1644
01:16:32.052 --> 01:16:33.819
Any God worth believing in

1645
01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:37.257
certainly sends you dudes
in thongs when in need.


1646
01:16:38.925 --> 01:16:41.727
Or she just knows
that some asshole in Miami...


1647
01:16:41.728 --> 01:16:42.828
She?

1648
01:16:42.829 --> 01:16:44.296
Yes, my God is a she.

1649
01:16:44.297 --> 01:16:49.401
Um, she just might know that...
I don't know...


1650
01:16:49.402 --> 01:16:52.939
Some asshole in Miami stole your
smile and you need it back.


1651
01:16:54.374 --> 01:16:56.141
And I can guarantee you

1652
01:16:56.142 --> 01:17:00.012
that strippers will give
smiles aplenty


1653
01:17:00.013 --> 01:17:01.847
and make you forget
about New York.


1654
01:17:01.848 --> 01:17:05.851
And if that doesn't work, then
there will be 3,000 women there,


1655
01:17:05.852 --> 01:17:09.488
seeing as you're not
in a boy phase.


1656
01:17:09.489 --> 01:17:11.791
That's quite a pitch.
Mm.


1657
01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:13.392
Look, when shit's not going
your way,


1658
01:17:13.393 --> 01:17:15.995
getting a little crazy
with some random friends


1659
01:17:15.996 --> 01:17:19.398
has a way of helping you
sort out your own shit.


1660
01:17:19.399 --> 01:17:21.433
So I'm your friend now?

1661
01:17:21.434 --> 01:17:22.902
You've seen me pee.

1662
01:17:22.903 --> 01:17:25.806
I don't know anyone that's not
my friend that's seen me pee.


1663
01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.374
Fair enough.

1664
01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:34.346
Look, I don't normally trust
a cookie guy...


1665
01:17:34.347 --> 01:17:36.816
But I'll...
I'll think about it.


1666
01:17:36.817 --> 01:17:38.818
That's valid.

1667
01:17:38.819 --> 01:17:41.086
All right.
You think about it, Dolly.


1668
01:17:41.087 --> 01:17:43.255
I'm gonna go back in there
and feed the Wolves,


1669
01:17:43.256 --> 01:17:45.290
'cause it's getting
a little rabid in there.


1670
01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:46.892
All right?

1671
01:17:46.893 --> 01:17:48.828
It's Zoe, by the way.

1672
01:17:48.829 --> 01:17:50.062
Zoe.
Mm-hmm.


1673
01:17:50.063 --> 01:17:51.496
Nice to meet you.

1674
01:17:51.497 --> 01:17:52.764
Magic.

1675
01:17:52.765 --> 01:17:54.868
Magic Mike.

1676
01:18:23.796 --> 01:18:25.298
Thanks, man.
Yeah.


1677
01:18:29.502 --> 01:18:30.569
Morning, gentlemen.

1678
01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:32.171
Morning.
Hey, buddy.


1679
01:18:32.172 --> 01:18:33.638
Everyone sleep all right?

1680
01:18:33.639 --> 01:18:34.706
Yeah.
Yeah.


1681
01:18:34.707 --> 01:18:37.376
You boys have fun.

1682
01:18:37.377 --> 01:18:40.380
Mm.

1683
01:18:41.647 --> 01:18:45.251
Mm.

1684
01:18:46.719 --> 01:18:48.889
Mm.

1685
01:18:50.023 --> 01:18:52.091
Did you bangee?

1686
01:18:52.092 --> 01:18:53.893
Did you bangee?

1687
01:18:53.894 --> 01:18:54.927
Yes.

1688
01:18:54.928 --> 01:18:56.261
You banged her?

1689
01:18:56.262 --> 01:18:58.531
Was she the glass slipper?

1690
01:18:59.599 --> 01:19:00.933
Yes, man!

1691
01:19:00.934 --> 01:19:05.037
That wonderful, nice lady
was the glass slipper?


1692
01:19:05.038 --> 01:19:06.939
Hold it.
Every inch?


1693
01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.608
Wow.

1694
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:11.443
Y'all had a crazy connection,
man.


1695
01:19:11.444 --> 01:19:14.280
I could feel it.
I'm so happy for you.


1696
01:19:15.882 --> 01:19:17.282
What?

1697
01:19:17.283 --> 01:19:19.151
You got to be kidding me.
Yeah. What?!


1698
01:19:19.152 --> 01:19:20.719
You got to be fucking joking.

1699
01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.087
Oh, shit!

1700
01:19:22.088 --> 01:19:24.423
This is us?
It was the Ex-husband's.


1701
01:19:24.424 --> 01:19:26.858
Said she didn't care what shape
I brought it back in,


1702
01:19:26.859 --> 01:19:28.327
as long as I brought it back.

1703
01:19:28.328 --> 01:19:31.863
Didn't realize she'd
been married to Shawn Kemp.


1704
01:19:31.864 --> 01:19:33.198
Pimpin'!
Sweet!


1705
01:19:33.199 --> 01:19:35.567

of machinery, man.


1706
01:19:35.568 --> 01:19:37.002
Holy shit.

We've been expecting you.

01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:54.446
Uh, Ms. Davidson called ahead,
upgraded your rooms,


1721
01:20:54.447 --> 01:20:56.381
and booked you
our conference space.

Come on, man.

1727
01:21:12.232 --> 01:21:15.600
So you think it's okay to have
me wait for you for two hours?


1728
01:21:15.601 --> 01:21:17.936
No, it's not okay,
but someone should've told me.


1729
01:21:17.937 --> 01:21:19.171
Yo, man.

1730
01:21:19.172 --> 01:21:21.173
Don't say I never did anything
for you.

It's not gonna be easy.

I'll...


1795
01:24:25.925 --> 01:24:29.228
On the way back down, I'll...
I'll go over everything you got.

They'll hook you up.

1804
01:25:09.935 --> 01:25:13.037
Go on, make some money.
Give him a locker key.

1809
01:25:24.216 --> 01:25:26.217

I am great.

1813
01:25:32.325 --> 01:25:33.692
I'm a little confused,
'cause Dallas,


1814
01:25:33.693 --> 01:25:35.460
he didn't let me know
y'all were coming.


1815
01:25:35.461 --> 01:25:37.195
Where is he?
Dallas is not coming.


1816
01:25:37.196 --> 01:25:38.497
It's just us.

1817
01:25:38.498 --> 01:25:41.132
Baby, I don't have a spot
for you.


1818
01:25:41.133 --> 01:25:42.601
You got a spot for us.
Come on.


1819
01:25:42.602 --> 01:25:46.671
Honey, you know how this works.
You're not special.


1820
01:25:46.672 --> 01:25:48.707
Especially you.
You... you've been out!


1821
01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:50.775
How long?

1822
01:25:50.776 --> 01:25:52.477
"D... D... D... D..."
don't worry about it.


1823
01:25:52.478 --> 01:25:53.945
Couple years. Come on.
You can find us a spot.


1824
01:25:53.946 --> 01:25:55.780
You've not been dancing.
Come on. Look at you.


1825
01:25:55.781 --> 01:25:57.282
Let me see.
Come on. You know I...


1826
01:25:57.283 --> 01:25:58.850
Are you even in shape?
It's like riding a bike.


1827
01:25:58.851 --> 01:26:00.719
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.


1828
01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:01.986
I don't know.

1829
01:26:01.987 --> 01:26:04.856
Who's this? Big dumb Rick?
How you doing?


1830
01:26:04.857 --> 01:26:06.591
It's dick.
Okay.


1831
01:26:06.592 --> 01:26:08.827
So, you don't have an M.C.
We do have an M.C.


1832
01:26:08.828 --> 01:26:11.896
You don't have an M.C.
What am I supposed to do?


1833
01:26:11.897 --> 01:26:14.366
We do have an M.C.

1834
01:26:14.367 --> 01:26:16.000
Hey, gorgeous.

1835
01:26:16.001 --> 01:26:17.969
Shut the fuck up.

1836
01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:19.838
Mm-hmm.

1837
01:26:19.839 --> 01:26:21.840
Hey.

1838
01:26:21.841 --> 01:26:23.643
How you been?

1839
01:26:25.378 --> 01:26:26.811
How have you been?

1840
01:26:26.812 --> 01:26:27.613
Good.

1841
01:26:27.614 --> 01:26:30.583
So, you got a spot for us?

1842
01:26:32.818 --> 01:26:34.886
This girl taught me everything
I know.


1843
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:41.259
Who is at 10:20?
Bumper Grinders?


1844

All right.

1845
01:26:46.399 --> 01:26:48.667

1846
01:26:48.668 --> 01:26:50.034
10:20.

1847
01:26:50.035 --> 01:26:51.570
That's why I love you.

1848
01:26:51.571 --> 01:26:52.971
That's a money spot.

1849
01:26:52.972 --> 01:26:55.073
I expect y'all to make
some money in that spot.


1850
01:26:55.074 --> 01:26:56.174
Thank you.

1851
01:27:31.377 --> 01:27:32.477
How are the knees?

1852
01:27:32.478 --> 01:27:33.512
Rotten.

1853
01:27:33.513 --> 01:27:36.347
Yeah?
You good?


1854
01:27:36.348 --> 01:27:37.816
Tell you the truth, man,

1855
01:27:37.817 --> 01:27:41.853
I haven't felt this nervous
since desert storm.


1856
01:27:41.854 --> 01:27:42.788
What?

1857
01:27:42.789 --> 01:27:44.789
H-how have I known you
this long


1858
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:47.559
and I don't know that you were
in desert storm?


1859
01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.862
Just never came up.

1860
01:27:51.731 --> 01:27:53.297
Look, I don't know.

1861
01:27:53.298 --> 01:27:58.870
Me and you, we haven't really
had a chance to have our moment.


1862
01:27:58.871 --> 01:28:00.038
Are we good?

1863
01:28:00.039 --> 01:28:04.008
You know, Mike,
when I called you,


1864
01:28:04.009 --> 01:28:06.110
I didn't call
to fuck with you.


1865
01:28:06.111 --> 01:28:08.548
I called
'cause I missed you, man.


1866
01:28:12.818 --> 01:28:15.219
Read my fangs.
Let her make her own decisions.


1867
01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:16.488
Psst!
Whatever.


1868
01:28:16.489 --> 01:28:18.524
Chill, guys.

1869
01:28:19.158 --> 01:28:20.692
I fucked Bella!

1870
01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.307
Who's killing it out there?

1871
01:28:36.308 --> 01:28:39.143
Fucking vampire bullshit.

1872
01:28:39.144 --> 01:28:40.545
Did you guys see this?

1873
01:28:40.546 --> 01:28:42.213
They're doing
a fucking "Twilight" routine


1874
01:28:42.214 --> 01:28:43.448
and they're mopping up.

1875
01:28:43.449 --> 01:28:45.484
All those tweeners
are growing up, man.


1876
01:28:45.485 --> 01:28:47.452
Makes perfect sense.

1877
01:28:47.453 --> 01:28:50.421
Mm. That's true.
Yep.


1878
01:28:54.226 --> 01:28:55.594
Wow.
Okay.


1879
01:28:55.595 --> 01:28:57.696
Dude, I-I just don't want to
fuck this up, man.


1880
01:28:57.697 --> 01:28:59.831
What are you t...
You're not gonna fuck this up.


1881
01:28:59.832 --> 01:29:01.466
And look,
and on the off chance


1882
01:29:01.467 --> 01:29:03.868
that we actually go out there
and shit the bed, who cares?


1883
01:29:03.869 --> 01:29:05.303
Don't say that.
Why? Fuck it.


1884
01:29:05.304 --> 01:29:06.605
Look, I love you guys.

1885
01:29:06.606 --> 01:29:08.239
This trip has been ridiculous
and amazing.


1886
01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:11.242
So please do not make me give
the whole


1887
01:29:11.243 --> 01:29:13.111
"it's not about
how we go out there and do it,


1888
01:29:13.112 --> 01:29:15.947
it's about getting to go out
there and do it together" speech


1889
01:29:15.948 --> 01:29:18.016
that I just fucking gave you.

1890
01:29:18.017 --> 01:29:19.751
W... okay.

1891
01:29:19.752 --> 01:29:21.352
Richie, what are you?

1892
01:29:21.353 --> 01:29:22.954
You're not a fireman.

1893
01:29:22.955 --> 01:29:24.556
What are you?

1894
01:29:24.557 --> 01:29:26.625
I'm a m-male entertainer.

1895
01:29:26.626 --> 01:29:27.659
Entertainer.

1896
01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:29.093
Ooh, yeah.
What are we?


1897
01:29:29.094 --> 01:29:30.495
Fuck it, man.
Male entertainers.


1898
01:29:30.496 --> 01:29:31.630
That's right. Come on.
Get it in.


1899
01:29:31.631 --> 01:29:32.764
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1900
01:29:32.765 --> 01:29:33.998
Hold that up.
Hold that up.


1901
01:29:33.999 --> 01:29:35.567
Look, it's not bro time,
it's showtime.


1902
01:29:35.568 --> 01:29:36.801
Are you guys ready? Yeah.
We're ready.


1903
01:29:36.802 --> 01:29:38.838
All right. Come on.
Let's do this.


1904
01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.674
All right. Ready?
One, two, three.


1905
01:29:42.675 --> 01:29:44.142
Male entertainers!

1906
01:29:45.444 --> 01:29:47.812
We're strippers.
We're strippers.


1907
01:29:47.813 --> 01:29:52.551
Whoo! Yes!
Giving it up!


1908
01:29:52.552 --> 01:29:56.655
Oh, Men of Steel
in the "Twilight" routine!


1909
01:29:59.158 --> 01:30:00.592
Oh, that was hot!

1910
01:30:00.593 --> 01:30:03.094
Can I hear y'all say "Hot"?

1911
01:30:03.095 --> 01:30:04.696
Hot!
Whoo!


1912
01:30:04.697 --> 01:30:07.832
That's a nice Southern welcome.

1913
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:13.538
All right.

1914
01:30:13.539 --> 01:30:16.074
Now, I know this is not
a competition,


1915
01:30:16.075 --> 01:30:18.710
but y'all are gonna go home
with your favorites tonight.


1916
01:30:21.513 --> 01:30:24.482
One of my all-time favorites

1917
01:30:24.483 --> 01:30:29.487
is making an appearance on this
stage after a little while away.


1918
01:30:29.488 --> 01:30:31.389
Magical little dancer.

1919
01:30:33.392 --> 01:30:34.793
Mm-hmm.

1920
01:30:34.794 --> 01:30:38.130
He's been gone a little while,
but he's back.


1921
01:30:39.665 --> 01:30:42.701
He has hooked up
with the devil himself...


1922
01:30:45.037 --> 01:30:49.107
...and he is back tonight
with those friends


1923
01:30:49.108 --> 01:30:51.776
to entertain
your beautiful selves.


1924
01:30:51.777 --> 01:30:55.780
Here they are...
Reserrection!


1925
01:31:00.986 --> 01:31:02.954
Good evening, friends.

1926
01:31:02.955 --> 01:31:05.423
This is what
you're all here for.


1927
01:31:08.427 --> 01:31:11.362
Lift-off in five, four,

1928
01:31:11.363 --> 01:31:14.165
three, two, one.

1929
01:31:14.166 --> 01:31:15.466
Ignition.

1930
01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:21.640
Hold this.

1931
01:31:30.482 --> 01:31:35.320
Just wait till you see
what we got coming up.


1932
01:31:53.906 --> 01:31:56.207
Did you like that, ladies?

1933
01:31:57.943 --> 01:32:00.813
Was it good to you?

1934
01:32:02.181 --> 01:32:07.185
Well, just so you know,
my name is Rome.


1935
01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:11.823
I'm gonna be your M.C. Tonight.

1936
01:32:11.824 --> 01:32:16.327
Now, ladies, do you mind
if I refer to you all as queens?


1937
01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:20.899
'Cause every last one of you
up in here is a queen,


1938
01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:23.467
and don't you ever forget it!

1939
01:32:26.371 --> 01:32:31.976
Now, with that being said,
are you ready to be worshipped?


1940
01:32:34.046 --> 01:32:37.315
Are you ready to be exalted?

1941
01:32:40.019 --> 01:32:43.888
Are you ready to meet
a special kind of beast


1942
01:32:43.889 --> 01:32:46.791
that can bring
all the beauty out in you?


1943
01:32:50.696 --> 01:32:55.633
Well, without further ado, we
have our first king tonight...


1944
01:32:55.634 --> 01:32:56.868
Tarzan.

1945
01:34:06.806 --> 01:34:09.173
I don't know about you, queens,

1946
01:34:09.174 --> 01:34:13.177
but I'd let that beast throw
whatever he wanted on me


1947
01:34:13.178 --> 01:34:14.512
any day.

1948
01:34:17.917 --> 01:34:22.386
You know how the alchemy of
opposites can be so satisfying?


1949
01:34:24.623 --> 01:34:27.959
You have a little bit of cold
with a little bit of hot.


1950
01:34:29.661 --> 01:34:33.497
You have a little bit of yes
with a little bit of no.


1951
01:34:36.568 --> 01:34:40.638
And you know how we like our
kings to be really, really sweet


1952
01:34:40.639 --> 01:34:44.342
and really, really hard
all at the same time.


1953
01:34:46.478 --> 01:34:47.578
Yes, lord.

1954
01:34:49.281 --> 01:34:53.451
I introduce to you
our candy king... Tito!


1955
01:34:53.452 --> 01:34:56.620
Yeah.

1956
01:34:56.621 --> 01:34:59.357
Uh-huh.

1957
01:34:59.358 --> 01:35:01.292

Y'all ladies hear

2051
01:40:30.955 --> 01:40:32.756
But now to a more serious
subject.


2052
01:40:32.757 --> 01:40:36.594
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here


2053
01:40:36.595 --> 01:40:38.996
in the presence of every male
entertainer in the Hemisphere.


2054
01:40:38.997 --> 01:40:42.166
Y'all do this every year,
and every year you do it well.


2055
01:40:42.167 --> 01:40:44.001
You do it well,

2056
01:40:44.002 --> 01:40:46.404
that hide-and-seek,
that don't-go-tell...


2057
01:40:46.405 --> 01:40:48.839
It's okay.
You can touch.


2058
01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.709
...that every woman in this room
deserves.


2059
01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:56.780
And simply because there are
so many of you and so few of us,


2060
01:40:56.781 --> 01:40:59.483
there is something
we simply can't give.


2061
01:40:59.484 --> 01:41:02.886
But... we're gonna try to
tonight.


2062
01:41:05.657 --> 01:41:10.828
Because everybody deserves
just a little... commitment.

two grown-ass women


2111
