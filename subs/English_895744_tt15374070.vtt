2
00:01:37.946 --> 00:01:41.484
Why? We did everything!

3
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.261
Okay, so check it out.

4
00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:08.664
are, like,

5
00:04:08.697 --> 00:04:10.332
the best movies
in the last 30 years.


6
00:04:10.365 --> 00:04:14.236
Did you see Kevin Costner?
He's a fucking merman!


7
00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.138
Did you see the fucking things
behind his ears?


8
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:17.640
I mean,
that's where the gills were.


9
00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:19.408
You know that, right?
He was, like, half fish.


10
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:21.644
is '80s.

11
00:04:21.677 --> 00:04:23.912
Dune.

12
00:04:23.945 --> 00:04:27.716
And also no Sting in...
It's a thong.


13
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:29.051
It's like a space thong.

14
00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:31.120
Space thong?
You guys talking about Sting?


15
00:04:31.153 --> 00:04:32.688
You know what Sting does?

16
00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:34.423
Are you aware of this?
I don't know if you know this.


17
00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:35.358
He delivers albums.

18
00:04:37.092 --> 00:04:39.228
Where's my fucking record,
Grohl?


19
00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:40.863
It's all up here.

20
00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:42.865
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah, it's all up here.


21
00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:48.037
And in there, and in there,
and in there, and in there.


22
00:04:48.403 --> 00:04:50.072
Not so much here,

23
00:04:50.105 --> 00:04:51.707
but I got it, man.
It's all in here.


24
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.443
I think, personally,
that doesn't amount


25
00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:56.345
to a bucket of frozen shit.

26
00:04:56.378 --> 00:04:59.181
I don't know where you get
a bucket of frozen shit,


27
00:04:59.214 --> 00:05:00.716
but that's what it's about!

28
00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.085
When you fucking tell me
you got a record,


29
00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:05.220
all I got is a bucket
of frozen shit!


30
00:05:05.253 --> 00:05:07.356
I'm up to my eyeballs
in debt...


31
00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.757
and I gotta pay

32
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.894
some crazy piece-of-shit
motherfuckers


33
00:05:11.927 --> 00:05:13.896
who I owe so much money to

34
00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.231
and I just found out
they may be the ones


35
00:05:16.264 --> 00:05:20.302
who fucking sliced up
that journalist in Turkey.


36
00:05:20.335 --> 00:05:21.737
I just want to give you

37
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.138
the fucking album
that you want,


38
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:24.773
so you can pay off
those people


39
00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:27.443
before they turn your nut sack
into a fucking coin purse.


40
00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:29.278
- Relax.
- Oh.


41
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:31.246
- Did you just say "relax"?
- Yeah.


42
00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:33.348
So here's the thing.

43
00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:37.720
We were thinking...
it's our tenth album, okay?


44
00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:39.922
We can't do the same old shit.

45
00:05:39.955 --> 00:05:41.890
We gotta break
the fucking mold on this one.


46
00:05:41.923 --> 00:05:44.093
Yeah, Shill, this record...

47
00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:46.328
it's gotta fucking blow
your fucking dick


48
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:47.796
right into your fucking mouth.

49
00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:49.932
Blow your own dick
into your mouth?


50
00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:52.234
Yeah, right back up
into your mouth, man.


51
00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:54.369
Right back up
into your mouth?


52
00:05:54.402 --> 00:05:56.839
Like it's been there before?

53
00:05:56.872 --> 00:06:00.743
What kind of goal is that?
I don't want that album!


54
00:06:00.776 --> 00:06:02.344
Unless it makes me
a lot of money.


55
00:06:02.377 --> 00:06:05.214
Lot of money?
Blow all the dicks you want.


56
00:06:05.247 --> 00:06:07.249
Look, I can get you a studio,

57
00:06:07.282 --> 00:06:09.318
anywhere you want in town
tomorrow.


58
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:11.120
We've used all those studios,
okay?


59
00:06:11.153 --> 00:06:13.055
They all sound exactly
the fucking same.


60
00:06:13.088 --> 00:06:14.823
Okay? Let's think
outside the box.


61
00:06:14.856 --> 00:06:16.492
Let's go somewhere
we've never been.


62
00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:18.260
Let's go to a cool place...
Like Zeppelin.


63
00:06:18.293 --> 00:06:20.062
When Zeppelin
went to the castle...


64
00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:22.097
and there was the devil
and the wizards


65
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.398
and the dragons and shit.

66
00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:25.033
All right.
So, you want me to find you


67
00:06:25.066 --> 00:06:26.235
some wizards and dragons?

68
00:06:26.268 --> 00:06:29.004
Yes! That's what
we should be doing.


69
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.247
You want that? 
You want that?

70
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.216
Watch as I make this happen.

71
00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:44.987
Holy shit. You fuckers are
not gonna believe it.


72
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.523
I got it. You gotta trust me
and let me do this.


73
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.062
Chilly Shills. What can
I do for you, sunshine?


74
00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:55.297
Hey, Barb!

75
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.567
I'm here in my office
with the Foo Fighters!


76
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.569
And they're looking
for a place


77
00:07:00.602 --> 00:07:02.838
to record a new album.

78
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:04.173
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?


79
00:07:04.206 --> 00:07:05.374
Oh.

80
00:07:05.407 --> 00:07:07.409
I do know
what you're thinking,


81
00:07:07.442 --> 00:07:11.079
and I have the perfect place.

82
00:07:11.112 --> 00:07:15.017
Foo Fighters, oh, I thought
this time would never come.


83
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.285
Listen, I gotta jump.

84
00:07:16.318 --> 00:07:17.853
But I'll shoot you the address
in the A.M.


85
00:07:17.886 --> 00:07:20.889
This place is to die for.

86
00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:23.292
Prozem high five, up top.

87
00:07:24.092 --> 00:07:26.428
Jeremy is fucking smoking!

88
00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.989
Hi, Dave Grohl.
I'm Barb Weems.


89
00:07:54.022 --> 00:07:55.257
- How are you?
- Hi, Barb. How are you?


90
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.425
- I'm such a fan.
- Thank you.


91
00:07:56.458 --> 00:07:57.860
I would love
to get a selfie later,


92
00:07:57.893 --> 00:07:58.927
if that's okay with you.

93
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.929
- Okay.
- Hello, Foos! How are you?


94
00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:02.931
It's so nice to meet you.
Barb Weems.


95
00:08:02.964 --> 00:08:05.000
So this is the house,
and it is incredible.


96
00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:06.468
I can't wait to show it
to you. Come on.


97
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:09.371
This place... Okay, I know
what you guys are thinking.


98
00:08:09.404 --> 00:08:11.006
It needs a little
sprucey-goosey,


99
00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:12.074
and I agree.

100
00:08:12.107 --> 00:08:13.508
But here's the thing,

101
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:16.378
this place has some serious
rock and roll pedigree.


102
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:18.547
I mean, it rolls deep.

103
00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:26.288
A huge music manager
owned this place


104
00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:27.923
in the '70s and '80s

105
00:08:27.956 --> 00:08:30.392
and threw some wild parties.

106
00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:32.127
Come, come.

107
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.564
How sexy
is this stone-finished pool?


108
00:08:35.597 --> 00:08:38.367
I can already see the girls
in their bikinis.


109
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.501
Ooh, it's gonna be fun.

110
00:08:39.534 --> 00:08:41.436
Are you gonna invite me
to your parties?


111
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:44.573
Look at this
state-of-the-art kitchen.


112
00:08:44.606 --> 00:08:47.076
Do we have any chefs
in the group?


113
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:49.144
I'm pretty handy on the grill.

114
00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:50.245
- Oh.
- Yeah.


115
00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:51.446
Right, guys?

116
00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:54.917
Yeah, if you like
your meat charred and dry.


117
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.385
- Am I right?
- Mm.


118
00:08:56.418 --> 00:08:58.553
Take a look at the other room.

119
00:08:58.586 --> 00:09:00.455
Fuck you.

120
00:09:00.488 --> 00:09:03.158
This is my favorite room
in the house.


121
00:09:03.191 --> 00:09:04.626
These are original
Babette Fosters.


122
00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:05.694
You know, they stopped
production


123
00:09:05.727 --> 00:09:06.962
on those in the '80s.

124
00:09:06.995 --> 00:09:09.131
I do love a good sconce.

125
00:09:10.098 --> 00:09:11.266
But I don't know,

126
00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:13.035
it definitely has
a weird energy.


127
00:09:13.068 --> 00:09:14.503
You guys feel that?

128
00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:17.472
You guys get
this overwhelming sense


129
00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:20.509
of death and doom?
Or is that just me?


130
00:09:20.542 --> 00:09:21.643
Yeah, like someone's gonna

131
00:09:21.676 --> 00:09:22.711
jump through the window

132
00:09:22.744 --> 00:09:24.179
and start stabbing us
in the eyes!


133
00:09:26.214 --> 00:09:27.349
Okay, I'm gonna be
really straight


134
00:09:27.382 --> 00:09:29.017
with you guys.

135
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.385
There was another band,

136
00:09:30.418 --> 00:09:31.954
and they lived here
in the '90s.


137
00:09:31.987 --> 00:09:35.190
They thought the sound
was incredible.


138
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.993
But they never finished
their album.


139
00:09:39.327 --> 00:09:41.463
Creative differences.

140
00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:43.032
I don't know.

141
00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:46.468
Just doesn't really
seem like the right fit.


142
00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:51.507
Whoa. You hear that?

143
00:09:56.544 --> 00:09:58.246
That's fucking rad.

144
00:09:59.481 --> 00:10:01.317
Whoa.

145
00:10:09.024 --> 00:10:10.392
You hear that?

146
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.037
Okay, so if we put
the drums right here,


147
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.172
facing this way...

148
00:10:24.205 --> 00:10:26.441
and then we could put
the guitar stuff right here.


149
00:10:26.474 --> 00:10:29.478
And we could do keyboards,
like, over there.


150
00:10:29.511 --> 00:10:32.414
We can put the mixing desk
in the bedroom up there.


151
00:10:33.448 --> 00:10:35.417
Mm. You know.

152
00:10:37.052 --> 00:10:38.186
We'll take it.

153
00:10:38.219 --> 00:10:40.655
Oh, well, that is music
to my ears, baby.


154
00:10:40.688 --> 00:10:42.457
I'll go draw up
that paperwork right now.


155
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.094
Yay, I knew you would love it.

156
00:10:46.394 --> 00:10:48.196
Okay, you guys, check it out.

157
00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:53.535
The sound of this house
is the sound of album 10.


158
00:10:53.568 --> 00:10:55.637
No songs yet.

159
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.240
But we got the sound.

160
00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:07.049
All right, you guys,
you know the drill.


161
00:11:07.082 --> 00:11:08.383
All gear in the house.

162
00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:10.318
Amps, living room.

163
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:13.255
Snare drum, shitty job,
living room.


164
00:11:13.288 --> 00:11:14.656
Expensive shit, guitars,

165
00:11:14.689 --> 00:11:16.825
by the amp line
in the living room.


166
00:11:16.858 --> 00:11:18.794
Just fucking hate this shit.

167
00:11:28.203 --> 00:11:31.073
It's like a quarter of an inch
that way. Just...


168
00:11:31.106 --> 00:11:32.274
Just a little...

169
00:11:37.412 --> 00:11:40.249
It's like a hair more.
Just like a tiny...


170
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.723
Now it's too far.
Gotta bring it back.


171
00:11:53.228 --> 00:11:55.197
- Did you hear that?
- I did.


172
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.167
- Sweet, huh?
- Whatever, Dave.


173
00:12:01.402 --> 00:12:04.840
Who cares
about a creepy death vibe...


174
00:12:04.873 --> 00:12:07.109
drum sounds this good?

175
00:12:26.628 --> 00:12:29.098
All right, here's the deal.

176
00:12:29.564 --> 00:12:31.433
Shill's a dick,

177
00:12:31.466 --> 00:12:33.568
- we know this, right?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.


178
00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:35.370
But this is
our tenth record, okay?


179
00:12:35.403 --> 00:12:36.705
It's gotta be good.

180
00:12:36.738 --> 00:12:38.406
But we gotta make it fast.

181
00:12:38.439 --> 00:12:42.477
We gotta eat, sleep,
and drink this motherfucker.


182
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.613
So I'm thinking...

183
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.716
we move in to record.

184
00:12:48.816 --> 00:12:51.419
No, no, no. Hear me out.
Hear me out.


185
00:12:51.452 --> 00:12:55.223
Two weeks, tops.
Maybe a month.


186
00:12:55.256 --> 00:12:56.691
A month
in this fucking shithole?


187
00:12:56.724 --> 00:12:58.793
And then we can go on
with our normal lives.


188
00:12:58.826 --> 00:13:00.795
You tell my wife.
I'm not telling her.


189
00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:02.931
I'll tell your wife
if you tell my wife.


190
00:13:02.964 --> 00:13:04.266
I'll tell my own wife,

191
00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:05.700
but someone's
gotta talk to my kids.


192
00:13:05.733 --> 00:13:07.802
What am I gonna tell
my grandma?


193
00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:12.407
Oh, I can call your grandma.
She loves me.


194
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.442
You remember
the Hanukkah party?


195
00:13:16.611 --> 00:13:20.516
Come here, Grandma.
Sit down. Mm.


196
00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:24.719
Come on, baby, just touch it.
Yeah!


197
00:13:24.752 --> 00:13:26.321
Rami's not gonna know.

198
00:13:26.721 --> 00:13:27.856
Mm!

199
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:30.425
bubbe!

200
00:13:32.794 --> 00:13:35.464
Well, I guess that's settled.

201
00:13:36.698 --> 00:13:38.300
I got master bedroom.

202
00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:40.202
- Ooh, I get the guest house.
- I get guest bedroom.


203
00:14:20.775 --> 00:14:23.778
No. No, no, no.

204
00:14:23.811 --> 00:14:25.714
Excuse me.

205
00:14:26.781 --> 00:14:28.550
Excuse me.

206
00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:30.385
Hello.

207
00:14:30.718 --> 00:14:32.754
Hi. Excuse me.

208
00:14:33.755 --> 00:14:37.392
Hey, hey, hey! Yo! Excuse me!

209
00:14:44.532 --> 00:14:45.901
That's weird.

210
00:14:59.013 --> 00:15:00.749
How we looking, man?
We all good?


211
00:15:00.782 --> 00:15:02.384
Yeah, we're all good
on our end.


212
00:15:02.417 --> 00:15:04.486
Just need some juice, and we can
start mic-ing up the room.


213
00:15:05.853 --> 00:15:07.656
God damn it!

214
00:15:07.689 --> 00:15:09.658
Dude, who wired this house,

215
00:15:09.691 --> 00:15:11.493
a bunch of fucking
mental patients?


216
00:15:11.526 --> 00:15:13.729
Fuck. Jesus Christ.

217
00:15:24.972 --> 00:15:27.376
No, no, no! Don't touch him!
He's still hot!


218
00:15:34.682 --> 00:15:36.851
- Oh, what the fuck?
- Holy shit!


219
00:15:36.884 --> 00:15:40.622
Wow. He's totally fried.

220
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.297
He's fucking dead!

221
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.031
Oh.

222
00:15:50.064 --> 00:15:51.366
Oh, man.

223
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:58.540
Krug! Krug!
J├Ągermeister! Krug!


224
00:15:58.806 --> 00:15:59.675
Krug!

225
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:08.583
Guess we should pack up.

226
00:16:08.616 --> 00:16:10.952
That was a short-lived
experiment.


227
00:16:16.624 --> 00:16:17.693
You know, it's funny...

228
00:16:18.426 --> 00:16:20.061
Hold on, guys.
One second. Check it out.


229
00:16:20.094 --> 00:16:22.430
Krug was really
into this place.


230
00:16:22.463 --> 00:16:23.965
You know,
the way the drums sounded.


231
00:16:23.998 --> 00:16:26.735
Dave, seriously,
the guy just got turned


232
00:16:26.768 --> 00:16:28.036
into a fucking bratwurst.

233
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:30.472
Exactly why
we should stay here


234
00:16:30.505 --> 00:16:33.608
and make the record. Okay?

235
00:16:33.641 --> 00:16:35.711
It'll give his life meaning.

236
00:16:37.044 --> 00:16:39.047
You know?
We could dedicate it to Krug.


237
00:16:40.681 --> 00:16:43.385
I don't know. I don't know.

238
00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:44.586
I guess we can do

239
00:16:44.619 --> 00:16:45.987
a couple of drum tracks here
in his honor.


240
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.657
Exactly. That's what
I'm talking about right there.


241
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.127
We have to have some fun
with it, you know?


242
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.662
For Krug!

243
00:16:58.466 --> 00:17:01.770
People think I look a lot
like Willie Nelson.


244
00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:05.674
You know what, you guys?
I forgot to tell you.


245
00:17:05.973 --> 00:17:08.009
Earlier today,
before Krug got zapped,


246
00:17:08.042 --> 00:17:11.045
there was this weird dude
in the yard, creeping around.


247
00:17:11.078 --> 00:17:12.714
What kind of dude?

248
00:17:13.648 --> 00:17:15.016
Some weird guy

249
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:16.818
who was trimming the hedges
and stuff.


250
00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:20.588
The killer gardener of Encino.

251
00:17:20.621 --> 00:17:22.057
Wouldn't be surprised
in this house.


252
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.626
Oh, my God.

253
00:17:24.659 --> 00:17:28.497
What the fuck! Shit!
Dude, you all right, David?


254
00:17:30.465 --> 00:17:31.466
The meat...

255
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.669
it's Krug.

256
00:17:39.807 --> 00:17:40.976
Ugh!

257
00:17:41.576 --> 00:17:43.044
You know,
usually I have a clear idea


258
00:17:43.077 --> 00:17:44.946
of what we're going to do...

259
00:17:44.979 --> 00:17:47.081
but ever since we moved
into this house,


260
00:17:47.114 --> 00:17:49.517
my mind is flooded...

261
00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.686
where it's like,
sometimes it's like Prince


262
00:17:51.719 --> 00:17:53.054
and then it's like Slayer.

263
00:17:53.087 --> 00:17:55.824
Then it's like fucking
Lawrence Welk.


264
00:17:58.759 --> 00:17:59.761
What is it?

265
00:18:01.796 --> 00:18:03.231
You guys hear that?

266
00:18:03.264 --> 00:18:04.732
Probably some raccoon,

267
00:18:04.765 --> 00:18:06.601
'cause I heard them
eating the trash last night.


268
00:18:06.634 --> 00:18:08.970
Probably that creeper dude!

269
00:18:09.003 --> 00:18:10.839
He better not be filming this!

270
00:18:54.649 --> 00:18:55.917
- Hey, neighbor!
- Argh!


271
00:18:57.685 --> 00:18:59.287
God!

272
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.788
You should have seen
your face!


273
00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:03.157
Or should I say "feces"?

274
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.125
I mean, you looked like

275
00:19:04.158 --> 00:19:05.760
- you crapped your pants.
- Yep.


276
00:19:05.793 --> 00:19:07.262
I'm Samantha.
I live right next door.


277
00:19:07.295 --> 00:19:09.898
I just wanted
to introduce myself...


278
00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:11.666
in case you boys
needed anything.


279
00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:14.603
A cup of sugar.
Back-up singer.


280
00:19:15.636 --> 00:19:20.708
I got another
confession to make


281
00:19:23.778 --> 00:19:27.282
Were you born to resist

282
00:19:27.315 --> 00:19:30.519
Or be abused?

283
00:19:31.852 --> 00:19:33.254
Is someone getting the best

284
00:19:33.287 --> 00:19:39.761
The best, the best
The best of you?


285
00:19:44.332 --> 00:19:46.301
Oh. Thank you.

286
00:19:46.334 --> 00:19:47.635
We'll let you know
about that one.


287
00:19:47.668 --> 00:19:49.938
Okay. I'm around.

288
00:19:49.971 --> 00:19:51.973
Let me apologize in advance

289
00:19:52.006 --> 00:19:54.175
for all the rock
we're about to make.


290
00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:56.077
Oh, I can't hear anything

291
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.879
over my Portuguese
singing bowls.


292
00:19:57.912 --> 00:20:02.216
Ooh, those vibrations elevate
the frequency of the psyche.


293
00:20:02.249 --> 00:20:03.585
Play your cards right,

294
00:20:03.618 --> 00:20:06.087
maybe you will get
a sound bath later.


295
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.325
Okay, Rami-o.
Let's keep it moving.


296
00:20:11.659 --> 00:20:14.629
Namaste.

297
00:20:14.662 --> 00:20:16.197
Hey, is there some
sort of gardener dude


298
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.899
that takes care
of the property...


299
00:20:17.932 --> 00:20:19.634
trimming hedges and stuff?

300
00:20:19.667 --> 00:20:22.370
No, Dave. Nobody lives here.

301
00:20:22.403 --> 00:20:25.140
This house has been empty
for years.


302
00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.315
Okay, check it out.

303
00:20:34.348 --> 00:20:36.651
I got a couple new riff ideas
I've been working on.


304
00:20:36.684 --> 00:20:37.952
I'm gonna lay them on you.

305
00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:40.722
Riff number one.
Sounds like this.


306
00:20:48.162 --> 00:20:51.199
All My Life?

307
00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:54.269
Shit.

308
00:20:55.436 --> 00:20:57.872
Okay, no, no, no.
Hold on. I got one more.


309
00:21:03.411 --> 00:21:06.881
Dude, wait, wait, wait.
That's a great fucking song.


310
00:21:06.914 --> 00:21:07.949
Everlong,

311
00:21:07.982 --> 00:21:09.684
and you wrote it
about 20 years ago.


312
00:21:12.086 --> 00:21:14.322
What? The well's run dry.

313
00:21:16.424 --> 00:21:18.326
I've written
all my songs already.


314
00:21:18.359 --> 00:21:22.397
Ugh. All I have
are these random snippets


315
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.233
of fossilized MTV bullshit
in my head.


316
00:21:25.266 --> 00:21:28.670
Dude, dude. Look here.

317
00:21:29.437 --> 00:21:32.140
Have you ever
tried meditating?


318
00:21:37.745 --> 00:21:40.715
Fuck meditating
in the ass, Rami!


319
00:21:40.748 --> 00:21:43.251
All right, I'm gonna step out
for a minute, guys.


320
00:21:43.284 --> 00:21:45.820
Why don't we give Dave
a little space here?


321
00:21:59.266 --> 00:22:01.302
Something will come.

322
00:22:22.323 --> 00:22:25.460
Ugh! Son of a fucking bitch!

323
00:22:42.309 --> 00:22:47.982
I've been alone
with you inside my mind


324
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.052
In my dreams

325
00:22:51.085 --> 00:22:55.990
I've kissed your lips
a thousand times


326
00:22:56.457 --> 00:23:02.197
I sometimes see you pass
outside my door


327
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.465
Hello...

328
00:23:04.498 --> 00:23:06.968
- Ahhh!
- Hello, Dave.


329
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:08.169
Lionel!

330
00:23:08.202 --> 00:23:10.204
We all have writer's block,
you know?


331
00:23:10.237 --> 00:23:11.439
Mm-hmm.

332
00:23:12.573 --> 00:23:15.209
But that's my fucking song.

333
00:23:15.242 --> 00:23:16.778
- That's my fucking song!
- Mm-hmm.


334
00:23:16.811 --> 00:23:18.413
You understand
what I'm saying?


335
00:23:19.113 --> 00:23:22.550
I like that song.
No, no, no. I love that song!


336
00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:23.785
That's one
of my favorite songs.


337
00:23:23.818 --> 00:23:25.419
- I love singing that song.
- Mm-hmm.


338
00:23:25.452 --> 00:23:27.522
Love that song!

339
00:23:29.456 --> 00:23:30.959
Get your own song!

340
00:23:31.458 --> 00:23:32.827
Nerd.

341
00:23:53.113 --> 00:23:56.985
Ugh. Taylor,
sleep in your own bed.


342
00:23:59.119 --> 00:24:00.321
Taylor?

343
00:24:05.526 --> 00:24:07.028
You...

344
00:24:07.595 --> 00:24:09.097
are not...

345
00:24:10.264 --> 00:24:11.465
the first!

346
00:24:11.498 --> 00:24:14.002
Krug! Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry!


347
00:24:15.502 --> 00:24:17.371
They are watching!

348
00:24:19.306 --> 00:24:21.009
No, Krug!

349
00:24:43.964 --> 00:24:45.499
What the fuck!

350
00:24:49.536 --> 00:24:52.940
What the fuck!

351
00:24:52.973 --> 00:24:54.976
Oh, my God!

352
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.646
Fuck this. I'm starving.

353
00:25:37.484 --> 00:25:38.519
Yeah, I got, like,

354
00:25:38.552 --> 00:25:40.488
three or four
chicken parms here?


355
00:26:14.488 --> 00:26:18.359
Whoa. You're Dave Grohl! What?

356
00:26:21.195 --> 00:26:24.065
Yeah, I get that all the time.

357
00:26:24.098 --> 00:26:26.534
Uh, right. Yeah.
I heard about this.


358
00:26:26.567 --> 00:26:28.169
You're, like, incognito,
right?


359
00:26:28.202 --> 00:26:31.105
No, see, I'm not Dave Grohl.

360
00:26:31.138 --> 00:26:33.607
Dave Grohl
can actually write music.


361
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.444
Don't. I'm seriously
a huge fan.


362
00:26:36.477 --> 00:26:39.280
You're, like, my second
favorite band after Coldplay.


363
00:26:44.318 --> 00:26:46.988
You know,
I asked for extra ranch.


364
00:26:47.287 --> 00:26:49.490
Oh, yeah,
and I'll go run back,


365
00:26:49.523 --> 00:26:50.691
get some for you.

366
00:26:50.724 --> 00:26:53.127
Yeah, 'cause it'll only take
a few minutes.


367
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.996
You know, I'm in a band, yeah.

368
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:57.164
But, yeah, I'll run back
and get some ranch


369
00:26:57.197 --> 00:27:00.301
and drop it off with my demo,
if that's cool.


370
00:27:00.334 --> 00:27:03.071
I'll just use the marinara.

371
00:27:04.738 --> 00:27:06.040
Hey, what's up?

372
00:27:06.073 --> 00:27:08.275
This is Bob
from playthisriff.com


373
00:27:08.308 --> 00:27:10.344
and you've come here today

374
00:27:10.377 --> 00:27:12.613
because you have
song-writing constipation.


375
00:27:12.646 --> 00:27:15.583
So, when I have
song-writing constipation


376
00:27:15.616 --> 00:27:18.652
and I want a violent,
greasy dose of the hits,


377
00:27:18.685 --> 00:27:20.454
I turn to classic
riff structure,


378
00:27:20.487 --> 00:27:21.689
like this. Check it out.

379
00:27:23.824 --> 00:27:25.092
Part B.

380
00:27:28.695 --> 00:27:30.064
Part C.

381
00:27:36.336 --> 00:27:39.473
Am I the only one who cares
about the drought around here?


382
00:30:44.258 --> 00:30:46.727
Oh, fuck.

383
00:30:51.265 --> 00:30:53.734
Who kills a fucking raccoon?

384
00:30:57.004 --> 00:30:58.606
Ugh.

385
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:11.586
He's real.

386
00:31:18.025 --> 00:31:19.460
Dave...

387
00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:55.796
Whoa.

388
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.562
"Dream Widow." No way.

389
00:33:09.903 --> 00:33:12.073
This stuff's incredible.

390
00:33:17.043 --> 00:33:18.446
Fuck, yeah.

391
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.545
It's the sound.
It's this fucking sound.


392
00:33:51.578 --> 00:33:54.782
Yes! Fuck, yes!

393
00:33:55.215 --> 00:33:56.984
Fuck!

394
00:33:57.017 --> 00:33:58.786
It's fucking incredible!

395
00:34:05.158 --> 00:34:08.695
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no. Don't stop.


396
00:34:08.728 --> 00:34:10.598
There's gotta be more.

397
00:34:11.565 --> 00:34:15.136
Fuck, there's gotta be more.
Please, God.


398
00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.939
Please, please, please.

399
00:34:21.842 --> 00:34:23.110
Fuck!

400
00:34:23.577 --> 00:34:27.782
No. Shit! God damn it!

401
00:34:28.248 --> 00:34:30.985
God, it was perfect!

402
00:35:10.056 --> 00:35:12.026
Finish it and it begins.

403
00:35:15.595 --> 00:35:17.731
Finish it. End it.

404
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.136
Finish it and it begins.

405
00:35:30.577 --> 00:35:32.179
Fuck.

406
00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:34.515
Finish it.

407
00:36:07.213 --> 00:36:08.516
What are you doing?

408
00:36:08.982 --> 00:36:11.185
There's a dead raccoon
in there.


409
00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:20.928
Dick.

410
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.194
- Wow.
- Awesome, man.


411
00:37:28.962 --> 00:37:31.932
Fuck. It's like you were
musically constipated


412
00:37:31.965 --> 00:37:33.000
and now you just took

413
00:37:33.033 --> 00:37:34.868
the biggest musical shit
on us.


414
00:37:34.901 --> 00:37:36.770
- Fucking awesome!
- I know, right?


415
00:37:36.803 --> 00:37:37.838
I'm still working on it.

416
00:37:37.871 --> 00:37:39.139
It's like a hundred ideas
in my head


417
00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:40.941
just fighting to get out.

418
00:37:40.974 --> 00:37:44.044
Could be a double,
maybe a triple album.


419
00:37:44.077 --> 00:37:46.046
- I don't know.
- Let's get to work.


420
00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:47.147
Fuck you, Nate.

421
00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.916
Don't tell me what to do,
asshole.


422
00:37:49.249 --> 00:37:50.784
Told you it would come, man.

423
00:37:54.821 --> 00:37:56.256
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

424
00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.365
What key is this in?

425
00:38:09.369 --> 00:38:11.438
L sharp.

426
00:38:11.471 --> 00:38:13.707
You found a new musical note?

427
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.409
Hell motherfucking yes, I did.

428
00:38:15.442 --> 00:38:18.145
Came to me last night.
Just dropped in my head.


429
00:38:18.178 --> 00:38:19.880
Like, boom!

430
00:38:20.847 --> 00:38:22.349
You're welcome, music.

431
00:38:22.382 --> 00:38:25.419
So, the L sharp,
that's basically an E flat,


432
00:38:25.452 --> 00:38:27.254
only like an octave up?

433
00:38:27.287 --> 00:38:31.058
It's not an E, it's an L.

434
00:38:35.929 --> 00:38:37.230
If you guys could just, like,

435
00:38:37.263 --> 00:38:39.132
open up your hearts
and minds,


436
00:38:39.165 --> 00:38:41.068
you know, maybe you'd be able
to hear it.


437
00:38:41.101 --> 00:38:43.103
So, what happened to...

438
00:38:43.136 --> 00:38:46.006
H, I, J, K?

439
00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:51.211
G, H
I don't give a fuck!


440
00:38:51.244 --> 00:38:54.014
It's L sharp, okay, you guys?

441
00:38:54.047 --> 00:38:55.916
That's the root note
of the song.


442
00:38:58.485 --> 00:39:01.288
Yes, yes,
you're getting warmer. Yes.


443
00:39:01.888 --> 00:39:04.825
Pat, you're cold,
like North Pole, Antarctica.


444
00:39:04.858 --> 00:39:06.026
Not even close.

445
00:39:06.059 --> 00:39:08.862
I think I'm feeling something.

446
00:39:12.232 --> 00:39:14.768
Oh, God. Who the fuck!

447
00:39:17.337 --> 00:39:19.473
Hello?

448
00:39:19.506 --> 00:39:22.142
Oh. Any hungry rock stars
in there?


449
00:39:22.175 --> 00:39:24.044
Brought some num-nummy treats.

450
00:39:24.077 --> 00:39:27.247
Oh, God, I detest that woman.
Ugh!


451
00:39:31.084 --> 00:39:33.320
- Lemon bar?
- Go away!


452
00:39:33.353 --> 00:39:36.356
Dude, lighten up. She's hot.

453
00:39:36.389 --> 00:39:39.159
- Hello, beautiful. What's up?
- Hey.


454
00:39:39.192 --> 00:39:43.263
Some fresh-baked lemon bars
for my favorite band.


455
00:39:43.296 --> 00:39:44.464
It's my grandma's recipe,

456
00:39:44.497 --> 00:39:46.366
but I added
my own little twist to it.


457
00:39:46.399 --> 00:39:48.435
- Ooh, is that cocaine?
- Mm-hmm.


458
00:39:48.468 --> 00:39:50.036
Mm-hmm.
Not a good time right now


459
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:52.306
'cause we're working
on music, okay?


460
00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.344
How you feeling?
Everything okay?


461
00:39:57.377 --> 00:39:59.446
Never better.

462
00:40:02.949 --> 00:40:03.984
I'll get rid of her.

463
00:40:04.017 --> 00:40:05.786
Get her the fuck out of here!

464
00:40:05.819 --> 00:40:09.222
Hey. Sorry,
he gets really intense


465
00:40:09.255 --> 00:40:10.323
when we're recording.

466
00:40:10.356 --> 00:40:12.092
I need to talk to you, alone.

467
00:40:12.125 --> 00:40:14.027
Ooh, I'd like
to get you alone, too.


468
00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.865
No, it's about this house.
There's something evil.


469
00:40:20.233 --> 00:40:23.403
I should go.
Dave seems stressed.


470
00:40:24.404 --> 00:40:27.174
Hey, how about
that sound bath later?


471
00:40:29.509 --> 00:40:33.380
- What the fuck, cock-blocker!
- Fuck you, Rami!


472
00:40:54.434 --> 00:40:57.838
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold on, hold on, hold on.


473
00:40:57.871 --> 00:40:59.339
Uh...

474
00:40:59.372 --> 00:41:03.577
Taylor, take it from the boom-
bah-boom-bah-boom-bah part.


475
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.111
There's like eight thousand
boom-bahs.


476
00:41:05.144 --> 00:41:06.546
- Which one do you mean?
- You know which one.


477
00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:08.215
You know we're coming in at,
like,


478
00:41:08.248 --> 00:41:09.516
23 minutes and counting, right?

479
00:41:09.549 --> 00:41:13.520
So what? So maybe we have
a song that has no end.


480
00:41:13.553 --> 00:41:16.189
So, we're not close.

481
00:41:16.222 --> 00:41:17.490
I mean,
to me it just feels like


482
00:41:17.523 --> 00:41:20.227
there's something missing,
you know?


483
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.028
Uh, you know, guys,
let's just run through


484
00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:23.163
what we've got.

485
00:41:23.196 --> 00:41:24.531
I'm sure you'll get it.

486
00:41:24.564 --> 00:41:27.968
Thanks, Chris.
You fucking asshole!


487
00:41:29.168 --> 00:41:30.270
Go!

488
00:41:32.071 --> 00:41:33.640
One, two, three, four.

489
00:42:11.678 --> 00:42:13.380
- Nate!
- What?


490
00:42:13.413 --> 00:42:16.283
I got an idea, okay?
Downstairs, now. Let's go.


491
00:42:16.316 --> 00:42:17.417
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

492
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.485
Peter.

493
00:42:18.518 --> 00:42:19.552
Yo, what up, D?

494
00:42:19.585 --> 00:42:21.455
I got an idea.
Come downstairs.


495
00:42:32.699 --> 00:42:35.969
- Are those mine?
- Oh, yeah. I borrowed them.


496
00:42:37.704 --> 00:42:40.574
- Have you seen Pat?
- No idea.


497
00:42:42.108 --> 00:42:43.477
Hey, Pat!

498
00:42:44.377 --> 00:42:46.947
In here.

499
00:42:52.485 --> 00:42:54.354
What are you doing in here?

500
00:42:56.556 --> 00:42:59.125
Well, this is
the most comfortable place


501
00:42:59.158 --> 00:43:00.593
I could find.

502
00:43:00.626 --> 00:43:02.062
And there's snacks.

503
00:43:02.362 --> 00:43:03.430
Oh.

504
00:43:09.569 --> 00:43:12.539
- Voila!
- You made this?


505
00:43:12.572 --> 00:43:14.174
Yeah. It's like the only thing

506
00:43:14.207 --> 00:43:16.076
that'll get this song
out of my head, you know?


507
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:19.379
- And that's the song?
- Exactly.


508
00:43:19.412 --> 00:43:22.482
So, each one
of these little nails


509
00:43:22.515 --> 00:43:23.717
is one of us.

510
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:28.355
The yarn represents
the vibrations of sound


511
00:43:28.388 --> 00:43:29.756
that our music makes,

512
00:43:29.789 --> 00:43:32.659
connecting all of us
in an unending form.


513
00:43:32.692 --> 00:43:34.561
It's like the universe...

514
00:43:34.594 --> 00:43:36.629
You know, there's
no beginnings, no end.


515
00:43:37.764 --> 00:43:39.032
Great, Dave.

516
00:43:39.065 --> 00:43:40.467
Can we pick this up
in the morning?


517
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.469
Well, I kind of had these
new ideas, and I was hoping...


518
00:43:42.502 --> 00:43:44.604
maybe we could put them down
tonight so I don't forget them.


519
00:43:44.637 --> 00:43:48.508
No, man, I gotta go to sleep.
I'm tired.


520
00:43:51.177 --> 00:43:52.346
What did you just say?

521
00:43:52.712 --> 00:43:56.649
Come on,
I don't even have a bedroom.


522
00:43:56.682 --> 00:44:00.620
I never get any sleep.
Let's just do this tomorrow.


523
00:44:00.653 --> 00:44:03.523
Before that. Small word.

524
00:44:03.556 --> 00:44:06.192
Begins with an N,
ends with an O.


525
00:44:06.225 --> 00:44:07.594
Nothing in between.

526
00:44:12.198 --> 00:44:15.535
No. I said no.

527
00:44:19.072 --> 00:44:20.607
No?

528
00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:27.414
Did you just say no...
to Dave Grohl?


529
00:44:35.488 --> 00:44:38.124
I'm a fucking rock star! Okay?

530
00:44:38.157 --> 00:44:40.360
I get whatever I want,
whenever I want!


531
00:44:40.393 --> 00:44:43.463
The best parking wherever I go
for eternity!


532
00:44:43.496 --> 00:44:45.231
Them's the rules!

533
00:44:48.534 --> 00:44:49.402
Come on, come on.

534
00:44:50.503 --> 00:44:53.373
Talk to Jimmy Page
if you don't like it.


535
00:44:53.406 --> 00:44:55.642
Dude, what the fuck?

536
00:44:55.675 --> 00:45:00.146
I'll do it if you stop being
such a fucking dick!


537
00:45:00.179 --> 00:45:02.416
Thank you.
Can we just do this, please?


538
00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:07.821
- One, two, three...
- No, no, hey, hey!


539
00:45:08.588 --> 00:45:10.323
Is there any way
you could count it like:


540
00:45:10.356 --> 00:45:12.358
five, six, seven, eight!

541
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:16.797
Like a fucking dancer
counting in a dance?


542
00:45:19.532 --> 00:45:21.501
That's fine. Cool.

543
00:45:21.534 --> 00:45:23.537
Five, six, seven, eight!

544
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:27.407
Dude has gone
fucking crazy!


545
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.476
Like, ass-flapping,
dick-slapping,


546
00:45:29.509 --> 00:45:31.278
crazy.

547
00:45:31.744 --> 00:45:35.315
Listen. Come on, guys,
let's just buckle down,


548
00:45:35.348 --> 00:45:36.649
give him what he wants,

549
00:45:36.682 --> 00:45:38.485
and we can get the fuck
out of here.


550
00:45:38.518 --> 00:45:40.520
- Yeah, but what does he want?
- Hey, guys!


551
00:45:40.553 --> 00:45:42.288
Ixnay on the Aveday.

552
00:45:42.321 --> 00:45:43.623
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.


553
00:45:43.656 --> 00:45:46.793
- What's happening?
- What's up?


554
00:45:46.826 --> 00:45:51.231
I just wanted to say...
I'm sorry.


555
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:54.534
I'm sorry
for being such a giant, red,


556
00:45:54.567 --> 00:45:57.871
puckered orangutan's asshole
last night.


557
00:45:57.904 --> 00:46:00.807
This album means
the world to me, okay?


558
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.643
And I think I just
let it take over,


559
00:46:03.676 --> 00:46:05.879
and I treated you like shit...

560
00:46:05.912 --> 00:46:07.881
and I'm really sorry.

561
00:46:09.315 --> 00:46:11.751
Which one of you gave Dave
a hummer?


562
00:46:11.784 --> 00:46:15.355
- Rami.
- Rami.


563
00:46:16.289 --> 00:46:18.525
Listen, we're so close, okay?

564
00:46:18.558 --> 00:46:21.494
If we could just finish
this song tonight,


565
00:46:21.527 --> 00:46:22.629
we'll be out by Sunday.

566
00:46:22.662 --> 00:46:24.564
Promise.

567
00:46:24.597 --> 00:46:26.766
Stick with me. 
We can do this.

568
00:46:28.467 --> 00:46:29.903
The song is
pretty epic, dude.


569
00:46:29.936 --> 00:46:32.372
Right? I do think it should
have an ending, by the way.


570
00:46:32.405 --> 00:46:34.707
- Thank God.
- Okay.


571
00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.911
So I have this idea, right?

572
00:46:37.944 --> 00:46:39.879
It starts with Nate.

573
00:46:39.912 --> 00:46:43.716
The root, the foundation,
the bass.


574
00:46:43.749 --> 00:46:44.918
Nate goes...

575
00:46:50.823 --> 00:46:52.325
Chris, Rami,
you come in like warships,


576
00:46:52.358 --> 00:46:53.459
banging off each other.

577
00:46:58.364 --> 00:46:59.432
Then, Rami, you're all...

578
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:07.674
Pat, Taylor, you come in
like riders of the Apocalypse.


579
00:47:08.874 --> 00:47:10.410
- Whack!
- Whoa!


580
00:47:10.443 --> 00:47:11.711
Whack!

581
00:47:11.744 --> 00:47:12.779
- Whack!
- Yeah!


582
00:47:24.957 --> 00:47:26.526
Bam!

583
00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:29.896
Like that!
You know what I'm saying?


584
00:47:29.929 --> 00:47:32.532
We got this. Right?

585
00:47:32.565 --> 00:47:34.868
- Yeah, we can do this.
- Pearl Jam high five.


586
00:47:35.401 --> 00:47:38.238
Pearl Jam high five.

587
00:47:38.271 --> 00:47:39.872
Break! We're still alive.

588
00:47:39.905 --> 00:47:41.508
Come on, let's go!

589
00:50:06.585 --> 00:50:08.454
You sure you want us
to leave?


590
00:50:08.487 --> 00:50:09.922
I think we're all good.

591
00:50:09.955 --> 00:50:12.525
All right. Well, if you track
anything this weekend,


592
00:50:12.558 --> 00:50:15.862
just pop it onto a drive,
and we'll mix it on Monday.


593
00:50:16.796 --> 00:50:18.598
Let's get out of here.

594
00:50:54.867 --> 00:50:57.437
How's it going, bro?
How's it sounding?


595
00:50:58.471 --> 00:51:00.606
It's good. I'm just
cleaning up some tracks.


596
00:51:00.639 --> 00:51:02.675
Cool, man. I haven't seen you
eat anything all day.


597
00:51:02.708 --> 00:51:03.743
Are you hungry?

598
00:51:03.776 --> 00:51:05.912
How about
some grill action, dude?


599
00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.850
No. I ordered
a shit-ton of steaks earlier.


600
00:51:10.883 --> 00:51:12.185
The guy should be here
any minute.


601
00:51:12.218 --> 00:51:14.854
Cool, man. I'll let you know
when he's here.


602
00:51:35.074 --> 00:51:36.843
All right.

603
00:51:42.748 --> 00:51:45.585
"Oh, Dave, I forgot you were
staying here!


604
00:51:45.618 --> 00:51:48.888
"Oh, well,
here's your food and, uh...


605
00:51:48.921 --> 00:51:51.758
"Yeah, I brought you that CD
I was talking about."


606
00:51:52.658 --> 00:51:53.960
Oh, he's not gonna buy that.

607
00:51:55.094 --> 00:51:57.897
Come on!

608
00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:59.632
You are a worthy
and talented musician.


609
00:51:59.665 --> 00:52:03.503
I'm a worthy
and talented musician!


610
00:52:26.025 --> 00:52:27.627
"Hey, Dave. Brought you

611
00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.829
a bunch of extra ranch
this time, man.


612
00:52:29.862 --> 00:52:33.733
"Oh, this? It's my demo
that I told you about. Yeah."


613
00:52:39.972 --> 00:52:41.508
Dave?

614
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.884
Hello? Dave?

615
00:52:53.252 --> 00:52:55.087
Oh, hey,
sorry it took so long.


616
00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.188
Yeah, I just wanted
to make sure


617
00:52:56.221 --> 00:52:57.757
they got your order right.

618
00:52:58.891 --> 00:53:01.227
It's all back here. I got...

619
00:53:03.162 --> 00:53:04.764
Dave!

620
00:53:08.334 --> 00:53:10.703
What the hell?

621
00:53:55.381 --> 00:53:57.784
Hey, did that delivery guy
ever show up?


622
00:53:59.051 --> 00:54:02.088
Yeah, I don't know.
Gonna take a look.


623
00:54:06.825 --> 00:54:09.629
Looks like he just
dropped the bags and left.


624
00:54:09.662 --> 00:54:11.731
You know, I think
I kind of freaked him out.


625
00:54:11.764 --> 00:54:14.000
He wanted
to drop a demo on me.


626
00:54:14.033 --> 00:54:16.002
- Mm.
- I wasn't really in the mood.


627
00:54:16.035 --> 00:54:17.070
Mm.

628
00:54:22.241 --> 00:54:25.011
What is it?
Think he's still out there?


629
00:54:38.824 --> 00:54:41.861
You can never have
enough ranch.


630
00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.836
Okay, so what's left?

631
00:54:50.969 --> 00:54:52.138
So...

632
00:54:54.006 --> 00:54:56.309
drum tracks tomorrow...

633
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.145
and then
we just gotta figure out


634
00:54:59.178 --> 00:55:00.746
how to end this thing.

635
00:55:00.779 --> 00:55:04.216
We're not actually making
a 38-minute-long song, right?


636
00:55:04.249 --> 00:55:06.819
- No.
- Okay, cool.


637
00:55:06.852 --> 00:55:08.788
It's gonna be
fucking longer than that.


638
00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:10.056
- What?
- Huh?


639
00:55:10.089 --> 00:55:12.758
- What?
- It's gonna be epic, man!


640
00:55:12.791 --> 00:55:16.729
It's gonna be
like 2112 times 2112.


641
00:55:27.406 --> 00:55:29.075
What?

642
00:55:29.108 --> 00:55:30.209
Hey, buddy, why don't you

643
00:55:30.242 --> 00:55:32.111
let me take the grill
tomorrow night?


644
00:55:32.144 --> 00:55:34.714
It seems like you got a lot
on your mind.


645
00:55:36.148 --> 00:55:37.750
Okay.

646
00:55:37.783 --> 00:55:40.720
Just leave mine raw, dude.

647
00:55:42.154 --> 00:55:44.724
It's so fucking juicy.

648
00:55:49.461 --> 00:55:51.897
Hey, guys, it's Barb!

649
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.833
I'm just checking in

650
00:55:53.866 --> 00:55:56.703
to see
how everything is going.


651
00:55:57.236 --> 00:55:59.772
Oh, my God.
They are barbarians.


652
00:56:08.447 --> 00:56:10.983
Oh, my goodness,
it's on the ceiling.


653
00:56:11.016 --> 00:56:12.985
Okay, how do they even
do that?


654
00:56:14.186 --> 00:56:15.755
Ugh.

655
00:56:24.897 --> 00:56:27.466
Oh, my God.

656
00:56:27.499 --> 00:56:30.369
What did you do?

657
00:56:34.173 --> 00:56:36.876
- Hey, Barb.
- Pat!


658
00:56:36.909 --> 00:56:39.312
I thought you were dead.

659
00:56:40.112 --> 00:56:42.215
Wow. Uh...

660
00:56:42.447 --> 00:56:44.083
How is everything going?

661
00:56:44.116 --> 00:56:47.487
Is, uh, is Dave done
with his big concept album?


662
00:56:48.187 --> 00:56:50.356
- He told you about that?
- Oh, yeah.


663
00:56:50.389 --> 00:56:51.957
I guess he's been talking
to Shill.


664
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:53.259
They seemed pretty excited.

665
00:56:53.292 --> 00:56:56.962
- Where is everyone?
- Upstairs, sleeping.


666
00:56:56.995 --> 00:56:59.331
Oh.
I used to sleep here,


667
00:56:59.364 --> 00:57:01.534
but not with all this crap
on it.


668
00:57:02.367 --> 00:57:03.869
A lemon bar?

669
00:57:03.902 --> 00:57:06.238
No, thank you.
I don't eat sugar or gluten.


670
00:57:06.271 --> 00:57:09.241
Or any citrus fruits,
or dairy, or corn.


671
00:57:09.274 --> 00:57:11.244
It's terrible for your gut.

672
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:12.845
Mm.

673
00:57:12.878 --> 00:57:14.146
You know,
they actually look homemade.


674
00:57:14.179 --> 00:57:15.915
Is there a baker in the band?

675
00:57:15.948 --> 00:57:18.217
Mm-mm. Lady next door?

676
00:57:18.884 --> 00:57:20.452
Samantha?

677
00:57:20.485 --> 00:57:23.089
That woman is a train wreck.
I've known her for years.


678
00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.397
- "Sacrifice"?
- What did you just say?


679
00:57:32.097 --> 00:57:34.433
I did, uh... Me... Huh?

680
00:57:34.466 --> 00:57:37.436
Um, I don't know. Nothing.

681
00:57:40.372 --> 00:57:43.409
Hey, Barb.
What's up? You made it.


682
00:57:43.442 --> 00:57:45.978
David, how goes it?
Is the album almost done?


683
00:57:46.378 --> 00:57:48.214
Yeah, it's so good.

684
00:57:48.247 --> 00:57:49.915
- Yeah, it's killer.
- Oh.


685
00:57:49.948 --> 00:57:52.084
Yeah, we're actually
wrapping up tonight.


686
00:57:52.117 --> 00:57:53.519
Oh, great.

687
00:57:53.552 --> 00:57:55.354
So I should make arrangements
accordingly then.


688
00:57:55.387 --> 00:57:57.023
I'm gonna go freshen up.

689
00:57:57.522 --> 00:58:00.092
Hmm, interesting guy.

690
00:58:00.926 --> 00:58:02.528
He's the best.

691
00:58:32.991 --> 00:58:35.962
All right. Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.


692
00:58:36.995 --> 00:58:38.531
Something's not right.

693
00:58:40.365 --> 00:58:41.901
It's the ending.

694
00:58:42.334 --> 00:58:44.237
You know,
there has to be more.


695
00:58:46.038 --> 00:58:50.009
You know,
if we just stopped recording,


696
00:58:50.042 --> 00:58:51.510
it would be over!

697
00:58:51.543 --> 00:58:55.114
Yup. A tight

698
00:58:55.147 --> 00:58:58.417
And then ending in a nice
slow fade '70s style.


699
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:01.120
'Cause, dude, I have blisters
on my fucking blisters.


700
00:59:01.153 --> 00:59:03.122
My hands are killing me, dude.

701
00:59:03.155 --> 00:59:04.290
Yeah, we've been looking

702
00:59:04.323 --> 00:59:06.659
for this mythical
fucking ending all day.


703
00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:10.396
You know what,
I'm fucking out of here.


704
00:59:10.729 --> 00:59:13.165
Whoa!

705
00:59:14.199 --> 00:59:16.502
Frigging dick sandwich!

706
00:59:16.535 --> 00:59:19.105
Fuck you, Shifty!

707
00:59:24.476 --> 00:59:28.213
What the fuck?
Forty-minute fucking song.


708
00:59:28.246 --> 00:59:31.650
"Look at me. I'm Dave Grohl,
the big fucking genius.


709
00:59:31.683 --> 00:59:34.453
"I don't have
any fucking rules.


710
00:59:34.486 --> 00:59:37.323
"I write songs
with no fucking endings.


711
00:59:37.356 --> 00:59:40.359
"Forty minutes long."

712
00:59:41.393 --> 00:59:43.295
He can't even cook
a piece of meat


713
00:59:43.328 --> 00:59:45.197
to save his life.

714
00:59:55.107 --> 00:59:58.143
Hey, Shifty,
need a beer or anything?


715
00:59:58.176 --> 01:00:01.013
Yeah, to shove up
Dave's fucking ass!


716
01:00:58.837 --> 01:01:00.506
Fucking blisters, man.

717
01:01:00.539 --> 01:01:03.308
I should start wearing
those stupid fucking gloves.


718
01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:05.077
Fuck this, man.
I'm outta here.


719
01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:06.745
Just hang out.

720
01:01:06.778 --> 01:01:08.614
Chris just had
to blow off some steam.


721
01:01:08.647 --> 01:01:11.784
We should get Dave
one of those magnet bracelets.


722
01:01:11.817 --> 01:01:13.352
His energy's way off.

723
01:01:22.561 --> 01:01:24.797
What the fuck is that?

724
01:01:25.363 --> 01:01:27.366
Oh! See?
Fucking horrific, isn't it?


725
01:01:28.667 --> 01:01:29.768
Who the fuck is that?

726
01:01:29.801 --> 01:01:31.303
And where the fuck
is his head?


727
01:01:31.336 --> 01:01:33.472
It's the delivery guy.
Look at all this ranch.


728
01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:40.379
Holy shit!

729
01:01:41.279 --> 01:01:42.347
Holy shit!

730
01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:46.218
That's the guy that delivered
all the food earlier.


731
01:01:50.755 --> 01:01:53.092
Don't touch that.
No, no, no. Ugh.


732
01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:54.560
Dave, Dave, don't... Ugh!

733
01:01:58.864 --> 01:02:01.500
"Bone Structure."

734
01:02:01.533 --> 01:02:04.103
He wanted me to hear this.

735
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:07.339
How long has this guy
been here?


736
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:15.081
I'm picking up
some energy beacons.


737
01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:19.585
He transitioned
around 28 hours ago.


738
01:02:20.352 --> 01:02:22.254
Where the fuck
did you learn that?


739
01:02:22.287 --> 01:02:23.589
Pasadena.

740
01:02:23.622 --> 01:02:25.691
First, Krug gets
electrocuted, and now this?


741
01:02:25.724 --> 01:02:28.293
Fuck this shit.
I'm calling the cops.


742
01:02:28.326 --> 01:02:30.596
- No, no, no. No cops!
- Fuck this shit.


743
01:02:30.629 --> 01:02:32.431
No fucking cops!

744
01:02:33.932 --> 01:02:36.502
What the fuck!

745
01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:39.438
Maybe Dave's right. We should
call Shill. I mean, look at...


746
01:02:39.471 --> 01:02:41.874
If this gets out,
it's gonna be bad.


747
01:02:41.907 --> 01:02:43.842
Listen, no cops, no Shill.

748
01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:46.245
Okay, we cannot afford
that intrusion right now.


749
01:02:46.278 --> 01:02:48.514
Guy looks like a fucking
salami sandwich up there.


750
01:02:48.547 --> 01:02:50.782
- What the fuck?
- I understand.


751
01:02:50.815 --> 01:02:53.585
This is bad. And this is sad.

752
01:02:53.618 --> 01:02:55.554
But if we call the cops
right now...


753
01:02:55.587 --> 01:02:57.656
they're gonna turn this place
into a crime scene


754
01:02:57.689 --> 01:03:01.260
and you can kiss that awesome
drum sound goodbye forever.


755
01:03:02.327 --> 01:03:05.831
- So, we just keep on going?
- Yes! One more day.


756
01:03:05.864 --> 01:03:07.766
We finish this thing out,

757
01:03:07.799 --> 01:03:09.801
okay, and then we can
call everybody.


758
01:03:09.834 --> 01:03:12.838
We can call the FBI,
CSI, NCIS.


759
01:03:12.871 --> 01:03:15.908
We'll call them all.
And then we'll give, uh...


760
01:03:15.941 --> 01:03:19.244
Darren Sandelbaum,
from Bone Structure,


761
01:03:19.277 --> 01:03:20.512
a proper burial.

762
01:03:20.545 --> 01:03:23.282
Caskets, flowers,
the whole nine.


763
01:03:23.315 --> 01:03:24.917
We can even tweet a link

764
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:27.452
to the Bone Structure
on our Insta-thing.


765
01:03:27.485 --> 01:03:29.855
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- You know what I mean?


766
01:03:30.689 --> 01:03:33.192
This is what Darren
would have wanted.


767
01:03:33.225 --> 01:03:34.326
And he might have wanted

768
01:03:34.359 --> 01:03:35.761
- to keep his fucking head.
- Yeah.


769
01:03:35.794 --> 01:03:38.197
He didn't want
to fuck up our record!


770
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:40.332
He loved this band.

771
01:03:40.365 --> 01:03:43.235
He died for our band.

772
01:03:43.268 --> 01:03:45.804
Let's do this, you guys. Okay?

773
01:03:45.837 --> 01:03:48.607
Do it for Darren Sandelbaum.

774
01:03:49.441 --> 01:03:51.210
You guys in?

775
01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:54.813
You in?

776
01:03:55.547 --> 01:03:58.217
- Well...
- Are you guys in?


777
01:03:59.651 --> 01:04:02.188
Come on, let's get to work.

778
01:04:05.557 --> 01:04:08.393
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna need
everybody's cell phones


779
01:04:08.426 --> 01:04:10.262
and the keys to the van.

780
01:04:10.295 --> 01:04:13.199
'Cause no one's going anywhere
until we finish this song.


781
01:04:18.303 --> 01:04:19.905
Thank you.

782
01:04:20.705 --> 01:04:23.308
Thank you. Thank you.

783
01:04:23.341 --> 01:04:24.876
Thank you.

784
01:04:24.909 --> 01:04:26.378
I don't have
a phone anymore.


785
01:04:26.411 --> 01:04:27.713
Thank you.

786
01:05:00.645 --> 01:05:03.782
It all comes back
to the L sharp. Got it?


787
01:05:04.783 --> 01:05:07.019
Yeah, we got it.
Totally got it.


788
01:05:07.886 --> 01:05:10.622
Let's just track the song
so we can go home.


789
01:05:10.655 --> 01:05:12.524
I'm tired.
My kids think I'm dead.


790
01:05:12.557 --> 01:05:15.994
And where's Shifty?
He should be here.


791
01:05:16.027 --> 01:05:19.798
He was out by the grill.
He's gone.


792
01:05:20.365 --> 01:05:23.001
Okay, let's just do this
one more time.


793
01:05:23.034 --> 01:05:26.471
- Count us in.
- Five, six, seven, eight...


794
01:05:26.504 --> 01:05:28.807
Actually, no.
You know what, this time...


795
01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.877
odd numbers only
in this section.


796
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:34.546
One, three, five, seven.
Hit it.


797
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:39.551
Okay.

798
01:05:39.584 --> 01:05:41.987
One, three, five, seven.

799
01:06:09.614 --> 01:06:12.451
He's still eating.
Let's go.


800
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.723
He came out of here.

801
01:06:18.523 --> 01:06:20.926
- I was back here eating chips.
- Big surprise.


802
01:06:20.959 --> 01:06:22.861
Then I found this.

803
01:06:22.894 --> 01:06:26.632
The neighbor lady that left
the lemon bars left this.


804
01:06:28.133 --> 01:06:30.969
It's a code!
She's been trying to warn us!


805
01:06:31.002 --> 01:06:32.704
You just want
to fucking bang her, Rami.


806
01:06:32.737 --> 01:06:34.773
Yes, I want to bang her.

807
01:06:34.806 --> 01:06:36.942
But I also want
to not get decapitated.


808
01:06:36.975 --> 01:06:38.643
Let's go ask her.

809
01:06:38.676 --> 01:06:40.045
She's always by the fence.
Let's go.


810
01:06:42.414 --> 01:06:43.815
That's you?

811
01:06:43.848 --> 01:06:45.817
I thought we had
an infestation


812
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:47.052
of yellow warblers.

813
01:06:47.085 --> 01:06:49.621
That was the wood thrush,
genius.


814
01:06:49.654 --> 01:06:51.690
Not here,
little thrush.


815
01:06:51.723 --> 01:06:53.492
Come to the pool.
We don't have much time.


816
01:06:58.663 --> 01:06:59.998
Guys! Hey!

817
01:07:01.199 --> 01:07:03.502
Come here! Now!

818
01:07:03.535 --> 01:07:04.936
How did you get over there
so fast?


819
01:07:04.969 --> 01:07:06.038
Now!

820
01:07:06.905 --> 01:07:09.908
I need you boys
to open your minds


821
01:07:09.941 --> 01:07:11.176
for a moment...

822
01:07:11.209 --> 01:07:12.711
and fucking listen.

823
01:07:13.945 --> 01:07:19.484
This house, this is not just
a creepy rock and roll house.


824
01:07:19.517 --> 01:07:22.154
We are standing on a nexus

825
01:07:22.187 --> 01:07:26.091
that allows spiritual entities
to cross into our world.


826
01:07:26.124 --> 01:07:28.727
Can it, drummer boy.

827
01:07:29.093 --> 01:07:30.595
You ever hear of Dream Widow?

828
01:07:30.628 --> 01:07:33.198
Of course.
They were supposed to be


829
01:07:33.231 --> 01:07:34.966
the next Jane's Addiction.

830
01:07:34.999 --> 01:07:36.902
Greg Null was
a fucking genius.


831
01:07:36.935 --> 01:07:39.137
Yeah,
till he went batshit crazy


832
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:40.939
and killed
his whole fucking band.


833
01:07:40.972 --> 01:07:44.410
Right here in this house.

834
01:07:46.244 --> 01:07:48.713
Yeah, that's just
rock and roll folklore.


835
01:07:48.746 --> 01:07:50.582
Mm-mm, I was there.

836
01:07:50.615 --> 01:07:53.752
Greg Null and I were close.
Very close.


837
01:07:53.785 --> 01:07:57.122
I was his number one groupie
and muse.


838
01:07:57.155 --> 01:07:59.558
Now we're taking advice
from groupies?


839
01:07:59.591 --> 01:08:02.194
Hey, watch the labels.
Groupies are people, too.


840
01:08:03.561 --> 01:08:06.097
You gotta understand,
this was the roaring '90s.


841
01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:08.633
No one gave a fuck about shit.

842
01:08:08.666 --> 01:08:13.238
But Greg, he was a visionary,
an artist of the dark.


843
01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:15.507
We were all into some

844
01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:16.775
experimental life choices
back then.


845
01:08:16.808 --> 01:08:20.045
The occult sex,
energy transfers,


846
01:08:20.078 --> 01:08:21.913
and spectrophilia.

847
01:08:21.946 --> 01:08:25.217
He possessed
this living book


848
01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:27.920
made from human flesh.

849
01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:33.258
The book was rumored to hold
the secret incantations...


850
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:36.128
of Aleister Crowley.

851
01:08:38.296 --> 01:08:40.665
As time went on,

852
01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:44.536
something truly sinister
took a hold of Greg.


853
01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:48.039
He was obsessed with this song
from the book...


854
01:08:48.072 --> 01:08:51.810
Lacrimis de Ebrius.

855
01:08:51.843 --> 01:08:53.612
"The tears of God."

856
01:08:53.645 --> 01:08:57.816
Every day he made his band
try to complete this song.


857
01:08:58.316 --> 01:09:00.919
He believed that perfecting it

858
01:09:00.952 --> 01:09:03.788
would open
an eternal portal...


859
01:09:03.821 --> 01:09:06.591
and the spirit inside him

860
01:09:06.624 --> 01:09:09.060
would become
a demonic passage...


861
01:09:09.093 --> 01:09:11.196
into our world.

862
01:09:15.633 --> 01:09:17.202
You guys were ghost fuckers?

863
01:09:18.736 --> 01:09:22.841
Somehow, the good won out
in Greg


864
01:09:22.874 --> 01:09:27.112
and he stopped it
the only way he could.


865
01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:30.315
Greg killed himself

866
01:09:30.348 --> 01:09:33.585
to stop the completion
of the song.


867
01:09:34.018 --> 01:09:37.822
But now, the spirit
that possessed him


868
01:09:37.855 --> 01:09:40.626
has found a new instrument.

869
01:09:45.964 --> 01:09:49.334
Go! Go! Go! Go! Faster!

870
01:09:49.367 --> 01:09:50.869
Go! Hurry!

871
01:09:52.303 --> 01:09:54.139
Shit! Shit! Shit!

872
01:09:54.172 --> 01:09:57.676
Oh, shit.
Fuck. Fucking dolls.


873
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:59.811
What the fuck!
God damn it!


874
01:09:59.844 --> 01:10:02.247
I didn't spend
the last 20 years


875
01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.949
teaching Pilates in Encino

876
01:10:03.982 --> 01:10:05.317
so that thing
can have its way!


877
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:06.952
You moved next door
to this place on purpose?


878
01:10:06.985 --> 01:10:08.353
Someone had
to guard the portal.


879
01:10:08.386 --> 01:10:11.022
Yeah, well,
he's already been possessed.


880
01:10:11.055 --> 01:10:12.691
What are we gonna do now?

881
01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.727
Bring him down here.

882
01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.330
Maybe I can just suck it out
the old fashioned way.


883
01:10:18.363 --> 01:10:21.900
- Oh, hell, no. Bad idea.
- Oh, sorry. Old habits.


884
01:10:21.933 --> 01:10:23.635
There's got to be
a better way.


885
01:10:23.668 --> 01:10:25.971
Uh, we just call the cops.

886
01:10:26.004 --> 01:10:27.973
Oh, my God,
that's such a good idea.


887
01:10:28.006 --> 01:10:30.375
"Hi. Dave Grohl's
been possessed


888
01:10:30.408 --> 01:10:32.010
"by the spirit of Greg Null.

889
01:10:32.043 --> 01:10:34.646
"Now he's on
a murderous rampage."


890
01:10:34.679 --> 01:10:36.181
Best idea I've heard since,

891
01:10:36.214 --> 01:10:38.049
"Hey, let's move
into this house."


892
01:10:38.082 --> 01:10:39.918
Okay.
What the fuck should we do?


893
01:10:39.951 --> 01:10:41.119
Come on.

894
01:10:42.654 --> 01:10:44.055
The book.

895
01:10:44.088 --> 01:10:48.126
It uses blood to stay alive.
He uses, um, raccoons.


896
01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:50.061
Ah, the basement.

897
01:10:50.094 --> 01:10:51.930
He said something
about raccoons


898
01:10:51.963 --> 01:10:53.365
when he came up
from the basement.


899
01:10:53.398 --> 01:10:55.634
Okay. Find the book.

900
01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:58.903
Turn to a passage
called Van Houten's Protocol.


901
01:10:58.936 --> 01:11:00.872
That will close the portal

902
01:11:00.905 --> 01:11:02.807
and send this fucking spirit
back to hell.


903
01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.842
What about you?

904
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:06.277
You're going to be in danger

905
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:08.246
now that you've
told us all this.


906
01:11:08.279 --> 01:11:09.848
Ugh.

907
01:11:09.881 --> 01:11:13.018
You wanna stay back
and make sure I'm safe?


908
01:11:13.985 --> 01:11:17.389
She's right. Nate, Pat,
you guys go find the book.


909
01:11:17.422 --> 01:11:20.025
Taylor, go keep Dave occupied.

910
01:11:20.058 --> 01:11:21.359
Drum tracks.

911
01:11:21.392 --> 01:11:23.361
You haven't done
any drum tracks yet.


912
01:11:23.394 --> 01:11:25.330
I ain't going anywhere near

913
01:11:25.363 --> 01:11:26.931
that fucking psycho.
Fuck that.


914
01:11:26.964 --> 01:11:28.733
No, just go up there
and fuck up the drums


915
01:11:28.766 --> 01:11:30.068
so he can't finish the song.

916
01:11:30.101 --> 01:11:31.403
Shouldn't be too hard for you.

917
01:11:31.436 --> 01:11:33.805
Eat a bag of dicks, Smear.

918
01:11:33.838 --> 01:11:35.140
Be careful,

919
01:11:35.173 --> 01:11:37.842
this is far
from a simple possession.


920
01:11:37.875 --> 01:11:41.046
That caretaker is
more than just Greg Null.


921
01:11:41.412 --> 01:11:44.850
There is an evil spirit
inside him.


922
01:11:48.853 --> 01:11:51.222
- Let's go.
- No, I said I'm not doing it!


923
01:11:51.255 --> 01:11:52.891
I'm not going near
that motherfucking house!


924
01:11:52.924 --> 01:11:53.825
Come on!

925
01:11:53.858 --> 01:11:55.293
Let's go! Come on!

926
01:11:55.326 --> 01:11:57.262
Fuck you,
motherfuckers!


927
01:12:15.913 --> 01:12:17.249
Yes.

928
01:12:18.449 --> 01:12:21.786
- He took the fucking SIM card!
- Quick.


929
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.296
I'll keep you so fucking safe
right now.


930
01:12:31.329 --> 01:12:33.331
I bet you will.

931
01:12:34.866 --> 01:12:36.501
I wanna take this off.
Take this off.


932
01:12:36.534 --> 01:12:38.937
Can't get it off!

933
01:12:43.541 --> 01:12:45.944
Wait, wait, wait.
Put some music on


934
01:12:45.977 --> 01:12:47.412
so Dave doesn't hear us.

935
01:12:47.445 --> 01:12:49.214
All right.

936
01:13:05.463 --> 01:13:07.432
Okay, let's go.

937
01:13:07.465 --> 01:13:10.869
Maybe I should wait up here,
to be a lookout?


938
01:13:10.902 --> 01:13:13.138
No fucking way, dude. Come on.

939
01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:31.556
My latest guilty pleasure.

940
01:13:31.589 --> 01:13:36.161
Ooh. That is my shit! Mm!

941
01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:37.829
Mm-hmm.

942
01:13:37.862 --> 01:13:40.198
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

943
01:13:58.883 --> 01:14:01.953
This is my favorite part!
This is my favorite part!


944
01:14:01.986 --> 01:14:04.222
Ooh, you're nasty.
I like that.


945
01:14:44.195 --> 01:14:48.299
Jesus...
somebody lived down here.


946
01:14:48.332 --> 01:14:52.304
Greg Null,
or whatever he is now.


947
01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:14.226
Ugh. Fuck, dude. Look!

948
01:15:16.427 --> 01:15:19.898
"The sacrifice
feeds the book."


949
01:15:26.103 --> 01:15:28.240
Poor little guy.

950
01:15:51.095 --> 01:15:54.399
Pat, find me something
to pry this open with.


951
01:17:08.339 --> 01:17:10.108
Fuck!

952
01:17:25.222 --> 01:17:28.460
Come on!

953
01:17:41.105 --> 01:17:43.608
Hey, buddy.
How you doing, man?


954
01:17:45.810 --> 01:17:47.245
The ending.

955
01:17:48.746 --> 01:17:51.049
I can hear it.

956
01:17:51.849 --> 01:17:54.786
All we need to do
is lay down the drums.


957
01:17:55.686 --> 01:17:57.822
The drums?
Why don't you and Shifty


958
01:17:57.855 --> 01:18:00.058
do some more guitars?

959
01:18:02.726 --> 01:18:05.130
Shifty's done.

960
01:18:21.812 --> 01:18:23.515
Warm up.

961
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:28.253
You're next.

962
01:18:33.357 --> 01:18:34.592
- What's happening?
- Fucking hell!


963
01:18:34.625 --> 01:18:36.528
With these
fucking demons!


964
01:18:37.361 --> 01:18:38.496
There's, like,

965
01:18:38.529 --> 01:18:40.431

968
01:18:46.403 --> 01:18:49.240
Ah. Here we go, exorcisms.

969
01:19:03.254 --> 01:19:06.591
No, no, no, that's not it.
That's not it.


970
01:19:06.624 --> 01:19:08.259
You're doing this
on purpose, man.


971
01:19:08.292 --> 01:19:10.428
No, man. I'm just trying to
get this fucking ending right.


972
01:19:10.461 --> 01:19:13.397
Okay, it's fucking simple.
It just goes...


973
01:19:16.167 --> 01:19:18.136
I'm pretty sure that's
what I was doing, man.


974
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:19.770
Pretty sure it's not.

975
01:19:19.803 --> 01:19:22.540
Dude, why don't we just wait
for Nate and Pat to get here?


976
01:19:22.573 --> 01:19:24.509
Nate and Pat?

977
01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:25.776
Fuck them!

978
01:19:25.809 --> 01:19:27.645
What do they know
about fucking drums?


979
01:19:27.678 --> 01:19:29.914
You and me, right?
We're drummers.


980
01:19:29.947 --> 01:19:31.883
We speak the same language.

981
01:19:31.916 --> 01:19:33.918
Let's finish
the fucking track.


982
01:19:33.951 --> 01:19:35.786
Can't we just wait, dude?

983
01:19:35.819 --> 01:19:37.488
Let's just finish
the fucking track


984
01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:39.190
and get out of here!

985
01:19:39.223 --> 01:19:41.792
It's not Dave.
You're not Dave.


986

What did you just say?

987
01:19:44.228 --> 01:19:45.830
I didn't say anything, man.

988
01:19:47.364 --> 01:19:50.201
Just play the fucking drums!

989
01:20:16.227 --> 01:20:18.530
Yeah. That's it.

990
01:20:21.332 --> 01:20:23.301
Yeah!

991

That's it!

992
01:20:59.303 --> 01:21:02.307
There you go, man.
I finished the fucking song.


993
01:21:03.474 --> 01:21:04.809
You did.

994

01:33:36.526 --> 01:33:38.228
Okay.

1114
01:34:02.786 --> 01:34:07.257
Oh, fuck! We gave shitty Dave
the keys! Ugh.


1115
01:34:07.290 --> 01:34:09.159
Just get in.

1116
01:34:10.326 --> 01:34:11.728
What are you doing?

1117
01:34:11.761 --> 01:34:13.464
I'm gonna do it
the old-fashioned way.


1118
01:34:21.204 --> 01:34:23.807
Hit the gas
when the wire makes contact.


1119
01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.142
What?

1120
01:34:25.175 --> 01:34:28.178
You need to hit the gas
when I spark it!


1121
01:34:45.562 --> 01:34:47.297
What are you doing here?

1122
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:50.100
See if there's
any others left.


1123
01:34:54.871 --> 01:34:57.541
Oh, my God.
Shill, thank God you're here.


1124
01:34:57.574 --> 01:35:01.311
This house is a fucking
shit show, man!


1125
01:35:01.344 --> 01:35:03.213
You have no idea
what we just went through.


1126
01:35:03.246 --> 01:35:06.716
The devil rules
all of rock and roll.


1127
01:35:06.749 --> 01:35:09.152
What? No, no, no. Listen.

1128
01:35:09.185 --> 01:35:12.489
This place
is a disaster, okay?


1129
01:35:12.522 --> 01:35:14.524
It's been a fucking nightmare
recording here!


1130
01:35:14.557 --> 01:35:15.759
Why did you send us
to this house?


1131
01:35:15.792 --> 01:35:18.161
Don't give me
your sob story, Dave.


1132
01:35:18.194 --> 01:35:19.696
I know exactly
what's going on.


1133
01:35:20.263 --> 01:35:22.599
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.


1134
01:35:22.632 --> 01:35:25.168
You know, rock and roll...

1135
01:35:25.201 --> 01:35:27.804
It hasn't been relevant
for a long time.


1136
01:35:27.837 --> 01:35:30.707
It needs an infusion.

1137
01:35:31.374 --> 01:35:32.476
Okay, I don't know

1138
01:35:32.509 --> 01:35:34.511
what kind of weird shit
you're into...


1139
01:35:34.544 --> 01:35:39.883
The devil will make
rock and roll relevant again.


1140
01:35:39.916 --> 01:35:43.420
The devil
will make it dangerous.


1141
01:35:45.522 --> 01:35:48.392
You finished the song,
didn't you, Dave?


1142
01:35:48.758 --> 01:35:50.160
Uh...

1143
01:35:50.193 --> 01:35:53.130
No, not yet. It's complicated.

1144
01:35:53.163 --> 01:35:54.397
We're close.

1145
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:57.167
It's just the arrangement
and the composition is...


1146
01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.505
I've been waiting 20 years
to finish that song!


1147
01:36:01.538 --> 01:36:03.440
I just needed
the right vehicle.


1148
01:36:03.473 --> 01:36:06.343
Someone who could handle
all that evil.


1149
01:36:06.376 --> 01:36:07.444
I needed you.

1150
01:36:09.546 --> 01:36:13.183
First of all, Obi-Wan Kenobi,
nice fucking cape.


1151
01:36:13.216 --> 01:36:15.652
Second of all,
you're so fucking lame!


1152
01:36:15.685 --> 01:36:17.287
Who the fuck
do you think you are?


1153
01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.455
Sending us
to this fucking shithole


1154
01:36:18.488 --> 01:36:19.556
to make a record?

1155
01:36:19.589 --> 01:36:20.857
You're just a manager, okay?

1156
01:36:20.890 --> 01:36:23.493
You don't know the first
fucking thing about music!


1157
01:36:23.526 --> 01:36:25.696
You just wanna
make your money.


1158
01:36:29.532 --> 01:36:32.402
I made you!

1159
01:36:44.347 --> 01:36:47.317
Pat! Pat, there's something
back there, come on!


1160
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:49.253
Oh, shit!

1161
01:37:02.332 --> 01:37:03.967
Pat, move, move, move!

1162
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.336
What the fuck do you think
I'm doing? Hold on a minute!


1163
01:37:06.569 --> 01:37:08.872
Oh, motherf...!

1164
01:37:16.646 --> 01:37:18.915
Dude, the time is
fucking nigh! Start the car!


1165
01:37:18.948 --> 01:37:21.351
Nate, give me a fucking
minute! I almost got it!


1166
01:37:21.384 --> 01:37:24.287
Come on, move!
It's getting closer!


1167
01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.522
It's almost here, Pat.
Come on!


1168
01:37:25.555 --> 01:37:26.856
What the fuck are you
doing down there?


1169
01:37:37.567 --> 01:37:39.736
Dude! Pat, now, now, now!

1170
01:37:39.769 --> 01:37:42.239
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know,
I know, I know! Hold on!


1171
01:37:42.805 --> 01:37:44.507
Hi, guys.

1172
01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.843
Stop fighting me,
Dave.


1173
01:37:46.876 --> 01:37:48.745
Stop fighting me.

1174
01:37:48.778 --> 01:37:50.647
I'm trying to help you!

1175
01:37:51.648 --> 01:37:53.350
The real you!

1176
01:37:54.517 --> 01:37:59.656
Donke zonke allar beiga!

1177
01:37:59.689 --> 01:38:02.693
Beiga zonke!

1178
01:38:08.531 --> 01:38:10.267
Here it comes! Spark it!

1179
01:38:15.505 --> 01:38:16.873
Nate!

1180
01:38:28.017 --> 01:38:31.955
Oh, fuck! Pat! Fuck.

1181
01:38:31.988 --> 01:38:35.392
Pat! Sorry, Pat! I'm sorry!

1182
01:38:52.542 --> 01:38:54.745
Barb?

1183
01:39:25.575 --> 01:39:28.945
Help? I killed my band
because of your help!


1184
01:39:28.978 --> 01:39:32.015
Die, you cocksucker! Die!

1185
01:39:34.717 --> 01:39:36.553
You finished it.

1186
01:39:36.586 --> 01:39:40.023
You finished the song,
didn't you?


1187
01:39:40.056 --> 01:39:41.692
You finished it.

1188
01:39:56.005 --> 01:40:01.078
You finished it.
You did, didn't you?


1189
01:40:02.078 --> 01:40:03.480
Ah.

1190
01:40:04.147 --> 01:40:06.783
Look at the rage in your eyes.

1191
01:40:08.451 --> 01:40:10.921
You're not Dave Grohl.

1192
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:16.760
It's time
for your solo career.


1193
01:40:35.745 --> 01:40:36.880
We're ready for you, brother.

1194
01:40:36.913 --> 01:40:39.116
That is a full house
out there.


1195
01:40:40.883 --> 01:40:42.919
You all good, Dave?

1196
01:40:43.719 --> 01:40:46.022
Never better.

1197
01:40:46.055 --> 01:40:47.457
Okay.

1198
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:21.510
