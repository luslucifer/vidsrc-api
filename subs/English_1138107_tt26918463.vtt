[theme music]

2
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.125
When I first stepped
into a vocal booth


3
00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.225
to record the voice
of Disney's Mulan,


4
00:00:46.227 --> 00:00:48.992
I had no idea how
much joy that film


5
00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:50.425
would continue to
bring audiences


6
00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:52.891
for all of these years.

7
00:00:52.893 --> 00:00:56.657
It also changed my life
and led to many other voice


8
00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.857
acting roles, including
returning to the character


9
00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.657
and world of Mulan many times.

10
00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.125
No matter what it takes,
I'm finishing this mission.


11
00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:07.892
As I gave voice
to these characters,


12
00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:11.292
I got to see firsthand the
changes in the animation


13
00:01:11.294 --> 00:01:15.192
industry as it shifted
from the 2D hand-drawn


14
00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:17.624
animation I loved
growing up, to fully


15
00:01:17.626 --> 00:01:20.557
computer-generated animation.

16
00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:24.125
Sometimes your song can't
start until you go some place.


17
00:01:24.127 --> 00:01:28.125
This is a story
celebrating the unique


18
00:01:28.127 --> 00:01:31.490
magic of hand-drawn
animation, how


19
00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:33.724
technology changed everything.

20
00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.192
And most importantly,
the remarkable people


21
00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:38.657
at the center of it all.

22
00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.858
And who better to
tell this story


23
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.524
than these visionary artists
themselves and the dreamers


24
00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:47.192
they continue to inspire.

25
00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:49.860
[music playing]

26
00:02:04.693 --> 00:02:07.824
Animation is a weird
unnatural art form in a way.


27
00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.457
I mean, you're
bringing something


28
00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.992
that is not alive to life.

29
00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:15.358
A character comes to life by a
whole bunch of scribbly strokes


30
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.358
on a piece of paper.

31
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.691
And I think this is
what grabs most animators


32
00:02:19.693 --> 00:02:22.757
or guys who eventually
become animators,


33
00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.791
is when they see that drawing
come to life on screen.


34
00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:28.524
It's like your brain goes,
OK, part of it is alive,


35
00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:29.825
and it's real, and it's moving.

36
00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:30.959
And the other part
is like, no, no.


37
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:32.791
Look, I can see lines up there.

38
00:02:32.793 --> 00:02:36.259
I can see things that
were made by people,


39
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:38.892
and that's I think
what fascinated me.


40
00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:40.524
You just run it
over and over and over


41
00:02:40.526 --> 00:02:42.624
and it's just
mesmerizing like this.


42
00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:44.691
Wow, I actually did this.

43
00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:47.757
It's a kind of black
magic, and it's something


44
00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.624
that many people can
go their entire lives


45
00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:51.291
without ever understanding.

46
00:02:51.293 --> 00:02:54.391
So is that what animation is?

47
00:02:54.393 --> 00:02:56.391
It's feeling the energy,
it's animating the forces,


48
00:02:56.393 --> 00:02:58.590
it's scribbling.

49
00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:02.524
It's like an explosion
of acting passion


50
00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:04.992
and physics on the page.

51
00:03:04.994 --> 00:03:09.159
And man, it's making
the impossible possible.


52
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.291
That was so cool.

53
00:03:11.293 --> 00:03:13.025
No, it's not real.

54
00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:15.425
You're looking at a
drawing but it's living.


55
00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:18.325
How does that work?

56
00:03:18.327 --> 00:03:20.125
That's the most amazing
thing to me about it.


57
00:03:20.127 --> 00:03:23.025
When they hear a voice
come out of a drawing,


58
00:03:23.027 --> 00:03:25.792
out of a character
that they've created,


59
00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:29.059
it's an illusion but it's
a marvelous illusion.


60
00:03:29.061 --> 00:03:32.059
And you just can't
wait to do more of it.


61
00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:37.590
The level of artistry to
achieve this is mind blowing.


62
00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.758
It's unlike any other art form.

63
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.557
And when you examine
an isolated moment,


64
00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:49.159
each frame is a masterpiece.

65
00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.959
But yet, when you put all of
them collectively together,


66
00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:54.590
you have an entirely new
dimension, a new level


67
00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:58.125
of the illusion of life.

68
00:03:58.127 --> 00:04:03.657
The people who invented this
art, craft, skill, however you


69
00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.125
want to describe it,
developed it to a point


70
00:04:07.127 --> 00:04:12.358
where they made you believe in
characters who didn't exist.


71
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.025
And I can go back to Windsor
McCay and Gertie the dinosaur.


72
00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:17.490
He had it.

73
00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:19.825
He got it right away.

74
00:04:19.827 --> 00:04:25.358
Somehow he breathed life
into this inanimate object.


75
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.425
As an animator, it's almost
without sounding too pompous,


76
00:04:28.427 --> 00:04:30.692
but I feel almost godlike.

77
00:04:30.694 --> 00:04:33.258
It was alive, and I just
like, oh, I can do this.


78
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.391
It was great.

79
00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:38.624
I think it speaks to everyone.

80
00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:41.925
It is a universal art form.

81
00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:46.092
It comes from a
very unique place.


82
00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:51.657
Creating out of the ethers
stories, drawing them,


83
00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:55.125
or whether it's on
computer now or whatever,


84
00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:57.758
it touches everybody and it
can elevate and bring people


85
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.358
great joy and great connection.

86
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.658
Cartoons make people laugh, man.

87
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.358
Cartoons are a way
into a person's soul


88
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.358
and to a person's heart.

89
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.758
But I think that first moment
where the light switch goes on


90
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.557
in your head, whether
you're a kid or an adult


91
00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.758
and you really start
to understand it,


92
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.524
once you get it you
really can't go back.


93
00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:20.391
WEN: And it all
starts with one very


94
00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:23.758
simple thing, a pencil test.

95
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.825
A pencil test to me is
the purest form of what


96
00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:29.457
it is that we do of animation.

97
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:36.061
For us, the pencil test is the
first reveal of a performance,


98
00:05:37.526 --> 00:05:39.992
in its rawest form.

99
00:05:39.994 --> 00:05:43.124
A pencil test is when you
find out how bad you are.


100
00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:44.858
I've done a lot of
pencil tests actually.


101
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.092
When I was in college, when I
first started in this business,


102
00:05:49.094 --> 00:05:50.658
that was probably the first
time I really had a sense


103
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.792
of what the potential was.

104
00:05:52.794 --> 00:05:54.825
And we were still
working with film.


105
00:05:54.827 --> 00:05:57.792
So you would shoot, hope
to God you timed it right,


106
00:05:57.794 --> 00:05:59.590
and wait eight weeks for
the film to come back,


107
00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:01.557
which now seems crazy.

108
00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:02.692
As painful as it
might be, it gives you


109
00:06:02.694 --> 00:06:04.758
a really good
grounding and starts


110
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.258
to get it into your head
what a 24th of a second


111
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.591
really feels like.

112
00:06:08.593 --> 00:06:11.358
It's a blink of an
eye for everybody.


113
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.490
But for an animator, you have
to know what that period of time


114
00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:19.158
means in terms of
certain actions.


115
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.158
You have to know what a

116
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.391
It was rough and wild,
but the forms had weight.


117
00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:30.158
And it was magic.

118
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.925
And I thought that to get it
work at Disney, to animate,


119
00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.557
you needed to draw a
perfectly like Sleeping Beauty


120
00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:38.992
and I didn't do that.

121
00:06:38.994 --> 00:06:42.091
I didn't know it was possible
to animate like that.


122
00:06:42.093 --> 00:06:43.858
Something pretty
amazing about a pencil


123
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.025
test that it didn't have color.

124
00:06:47.027 --> 00:06:50.291
And really the artifice or
the fact that it was drawn


125
00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:52.025
with a pencil was evident.

126
00:06:52.027 --> 00:06:54.124
When you just have
stacks of paper,


127
00:06:54.126 --> 00:06:56.524
you don't really get a
sense of the movement


128
00:06:56.526 --> 00:06:58.191
and the timing and
the performance


129
00:06:58.193 --> 00:07:01.725
until you see it playing
through the camera's eye.


130
00:07:01.727 --> 00:07:05.224
A first peek, it's kind
of birth, if you will,


131
00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:08.191
for an animated scene.

132
00:07:08.193 --> 00:07:12.291
So there's a vitality that is
in the very first pencil test


133
00:07:12.293 --> 00:07:16.091
after you shoot them that is
very exciting, very exciting.


134
00:07:16.093 --> 00:07:18.490
You're taking something
that only exists here.


135
00:07:18.492 --> 00:07:21.358
Nobody else in the
universe has it.


136
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.158
It's only here.

137
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.591
And it's coming out of your hand
and it's going onto the paper


138
00:07:25.593 --> 00:07:28.091
or on the screen.

139
00:07:28.093 --> 00:07:31.892
And those lines
are going to define


140
00:07:31.894 --> 00:07:34.959
that thing that's in your head.

141
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:36.457
But it's not just going
to define it as an image,


142
00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:38.725
you're using all
four dimensions.


143
00:07:38.727 --> 00:07:41.992
You're using height,
width, depth, and time.


144
00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:47.291
And all of those to create
something that lives.


145
00:07:47.293 --> 00:07:50.124
WEN: 2D hand-drawn animation
is one of the most incredible


146
00:07:50.126 --> 00:07:52.692
storytelling illusions
ever performed,


147
00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:55.391
and the inspiration for
becoming an animator


148
00:07:55.393 --> 00:07:58.525
usually comes at an early age.

149
00:07:58.527 --> 00:08:00.525
We all have our
first film that we


150
00:08:00.527 --> 00:08:03.858
see that drops you
into this medium


151
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.024
in a sort of a true epiphany.

152
00:08:06.026 --> 00:08:09.959
And that movie for me
was 101 Dalmatians.


153
00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:12.124
It just felt so
alive and vibrant.


154
00:08:12.126 --> 00:08:15.825
And the characters were
like real, even though they


155
00:08:15.827 --> 00:08:18.358
were completely exaggerated.

156
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.391
The dogs were real to me.

157
00:08:20.393 --> 00:08:21.925
Roger was real.

158
00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:23.625
Anita was real and
their dancing together,


159
00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:25.091
and this is a real dance.

160
00:08:25.093 --> 00:08:28.024
And then in steps
Cruella de Vil.


161
00:08:28.026 --> 00:08:31.124
I mean, everything about
that movie lit up my senses.


162
00:08:31.126 --> 00:08:34.758
Even seeing in a
newspaper article.


163
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.358
I remember there was
an article about 101.


164
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.224
Dalmatians being reissued.

165
00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:42.525
And there was a series of
drawings of Pongo running.


166
00:08:42.527 --> 00:08:45.925
Even seeing something like
that just makes my heart race.


167
00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:48.391
This is something about
a series of drawings


168
00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:52.358
that connect and projected will
give you the illusion of life.


169
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.725
That is the ultimate magic trick
to me and it won't let me go.


170
00:08:57.727 --> 00:08:59.924
I will always do this.

171
00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:02.792
My mom took me to see Dumbo
when I was a little boy.


172
00:09:02.794 --> 00:09:04.591
And I saw these moving
images on screen.


173
00:09:04.593 --> 00:09:08.191
I fell in love with animation.

174
00:09:08.193 --> 00:09:09.991
I saw Sleeping Beauty in the
theater on its first release


175
00:09:09.993 --> 00:09:12.591
and it was so powerful to me.

176
00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:14.525
I was terrified of Maleficent.

177
00:09:14.527 --> 00:09:17.091
I saw Snow White.

178
00:09:17.093 --> 00:09:19.692
I saw Bambi, Lady and
the Tramp, Cinderella,


179
00:09:19.694 --> 00:09:22.058
all of the classics.

180
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:27.291
And they made such an
incredible impression on me.


181
00:09:27.293 --> 00:09:31.426
The film that sealed the deal
for me, it was Jungle Book.


182
00:09:31.428 --> 00:09:33.625
And I was just mesmerized.

183
00:09:33.627 --> 00:09:35.591
And I started raining.

184
00:09:35.593 --> 00:09:36.458
And my family said, "Let's go."

185
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.458
I said, "No way.

186
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.825
Not moving from here right now."

187
00:09:40.827 --> 00:09:44.258
So I sat soaking wet
until the movie was over


188
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.758
because it was just
something happened that day


189
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.458
that sealed the deal.

190
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.191
We definitely had Disney movies

191
00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:55.392
on at home when I was young.

192
00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:58.891
My mom said when I was four, I
watched Bambi every single day


193
00:09:58.893 --> 00:10:01.091
and that's still one
of my favorite movies.


194
00:10:01.093 --> 00:10:03.426
The first movie I ever
saw in a movie theater,


195
00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:05.692
this is Mexico
City, was Pinocchio.


196
00:10:05.694 --> 00:10:10.525
And I became obsessed
with that movie.


197
00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.891
I dreamt of being
a little wooden boy


198
00:10:12.893 --> 00:10:15.091
that would be eaten by a whale.

199
00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:17.258
I was so excited by all
the adventures he went.


200
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.124
I mean, it's kind of a
scary movie but I loved it.


201
00:10:19.126 --> 00:10:22.124
I saw a special
or a series actually


202
00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:23.891
on Nickelodeon called
Lights, Camera, Action that


203
00:10:23.893 --> 00:10:26.258
was hosted by Leonard Nimoy.

204
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.792
And they profiled a college
kid who had done an animated


205
00:10:29.794 --> 00:10:31.924
short called Bandits.

206
00:10:31.926 --> 00:10:33.792
How long did it take
you to make this seven


207
00:10:33.794 --> 00:10:35.625
minutes of film work?

208
00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:37.758
It took about two years.

209
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.458
I think it was
about a guy and a cat


210
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.258
chasing some bank robbers.

211
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.857
It was pretty simple but
it was cel animation.


212
00:10:44.859 --> 00:10:48.224
And this was a kid
who was just like me.


213
00:10:48.226 --> 00:10:49.958
He wasn't in the business.
He wasn't in Hollywood.


214
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.991
He was hoping to get into it.

215
00:10:51.993 --> 00:10:53.291
And it was the first
indication that, wow, this


216
00:10:53.293 --> 00:10:55.625
is not this unreachable thing.

217
00:10:55.627 --> 00:10:57.491
This is something that
I maybe can access


218
00:10:57.493 --> 00:10:58.857
at some point in my life.

219
00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:02.426
In the '70s, we
didn't have choices.


220
00:11:02.428 --> 00:11:03.958
There was no cable TV.

221
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.857
You had like three
channels for adults


222
00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:07.292
and every once in a
while at Christmas,


223
00:11:07.294 --> 00:11:08.857
they'd run a thing for a kid.

224
00:11:08.859 --> 00:11:11.426
Then you had to
syndicated channels.


225
00:11:11.428 --> 00:11:14.791
And on those channels, they
would run programming for kids


226
00:11:14.793 --> 00:11:16.692
in certain parts of the day.

227
00:11:16.694 --> 00:11:19.924
So naturally, it was cartoons.

228
00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:22.292
So my entire life was cartoons.

229
00:11:22.294 --> 00:11:23.758
I didn't like the real world.

230
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.558
I liked cartoons.

231
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.991
Can you do this for a living?

232
00:11:27.993 --> 00:11:30.191
WEN: Animators
are often inspired


233
00:11:30.193 --> 00:11:32.458
and mentored by the
artists and visionaries


234
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.292
who came before them.

235
00:11:34.294 --> 00:11:36.857
Most of the people who
produced animated cartoons


236
00:11:36.859 --> 00:11:39.857
were in it as a
business, but Walt


237
00:11:39.859 --> 00:11:42.058
saw it almost as a calling.

238
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.891
He had artistic
ambitions for a time.


239
00:11:45.893 --> 00:11:48.692
He put those aside
because he was a leader.


240
00:11:48.694 --> 00:11:51.224
He was a visionary.

241
00:11:51.226 --> 00:11:56.658
He saw steps ahead that no
one else seemed to recognize.


242
00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.158
And he knew that for his
cartoons to get better,


243
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.857
which is always his
mantra, make them better.


244
00:12:02.859 --> 00:12:04.491
Make the gags funnier.

245
00:12:04.493 --> 00:12:06.891
Make the characters
more endearing.


246
00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:10.359
In order to do that, the
artwork had to improve.


247
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:13.158
His artists had to do better.

248
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.625
And he was the only
cartoon producer


249
00:12:17.627 --> 00:12:19.326
who thought in those
terms and actually


250
00:12:19.328 --> 00:12:22.525
put those thoughts into action.

251
00:12:22.527 --> 00:12:25.958
WEN: In fact, Walt Disney
started his own art school,


252
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.359
which would go on
to train generations


253
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:31.591
of animators and storytellers.

254
00:12:31.593 --> 00:12:33.124
The first thing I did when I got

255
00:12:33.126 --> 00:12:35.924
a little money to
experiment, I put


256
00:12:35.926 --> 00:12:37.924
all my artists back in school.

257
00:12:37.926 --> 00:12:40.924
Art schools that existed
then didn't quite


258
00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:43.824
have enough for
what we needed so we


259
00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:46.192
set up our own art school.

260
00:12:46.194 --> 00:12:48.824
I can really mention anybody
more than the nine old men


261
00:12:48.826 --> 00:12:53.958
because the nine old men were
Walt Disney's nine chosen best,


262
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.024
if you will.

263
00:12:56.026 --> 00:12:57.658
And this was a term
that Walt gave them.


264
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.392
He borrowed it from
the nine Supreme.


265
00:12:59.394 --> 00:13:02.259
Court justices of the
United States Supreme Court.


266
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:05.024
And the funny thing
is that Walt called them


267
00:13:05.026 --> 00:13:08.857
the nine old men of
a joke because they


268
00:13:08.859 --> 00:13:11.158
were pretty pretty young at the
time that he named them that.


269
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.591
I think they had like in
their 30s or maybe 40s,


270
00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:17.359
but certainly not really gray
haired old men at that point.


271
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:20.824
They were Woolie Reitherman,
Marc Davis, Frank Thomas,


272
00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:23.757
Ollie Johnston,
Ward Kimball, John.


273
00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:27.091
Lounsbery, Les Clark, Milt
Kahl, and my first mentor,


274
00:13:27.093 --> 00:13:29.392
Eric Larson.

275
00:13:29.394 --> 00:13:36.024
And these guys were
individualists who found a way


276
00:13:36.026 --> 00:13:39.958
to sacrifice some of
their individuality


277
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.392
for the sake of
the greater good.


278
00:13:43.394 --> 00:13:46.691
If they were all going to
work together on a project,


279
00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:49.292
be it Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs,


280
00:13:49.294 --> 00:13:52.491
or Pinocchio, or even
one of the silly symphony


281
00:13:52.493 --> 00:13:56.359
shorts like The Old Mill,
they had to work in harmony.


282
00:13:56.361 --> 00:14:00.392
They had to work toward a
common goal, which can't


283
00:14:00.394 --> 00:14:03.292
have been easy for artists.

284
00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:05.359
When I came to Disney,
the nine old men were still


285
00:14:05.361 --> 00:14:07.292
very much in the trenches.

286
00:14:07.294 --> 00:14:10.591
They were still cranking
out footage every week.


287
00:14:10.593 --> 00:14:14.159
About the only difference I can
say as far as guys like Ollie


288
00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:17.058
and Frank and Milt and
Ward and all the others


289
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.724
is that they were so
good at what they did.


290
00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:21.458
They just knocked
this footage out.


291
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.159
They made it look effortless.

292
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:26.326
They were that good.

293
00:14:26.328 --> 00:14:30.159
But they were the guys
that did the main character.


294
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:34.590
So it was like, Milt
Kahl did Cinderella.


295
00:14:34.592 --> 00:14:37.525
Frank and Ollie, they did like
Baloo the bear, and Mowgli.


296
00:14:37.527 --> 00:14:39.259
And they would always
work on characters


297
00:14:39.261 --> 00:14:40.259
that were closely related.

298
00:14:40.261 --> 00:14:42.624
Captain Hook and Mr. Smee.

299
00:14:42.626 --> 00:14:45.590
So these nine old men and some
of them were better at comedy,


300
00:14:45.592 --> 00:14:47.125
some of them were
better at drama,


301
00:14:47.127 --> 00:14:50.024
and girl characters, and guy
characters, and villains.


302
00:14:50.026 --> 00:14:53.058
But whatever their
skill set is, they


303
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.558
represented the top
stars for Walt Disney


304
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.225
in those early eras.

305
00:14:58.227 --> 00:15:00.458
And they were the
ones that ended up


306
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.326
training the next generation.

307
00:15:03.328 --> 00:15:06.491
They handed down the
legacy of Disney Animation.


308
00:15:06.493 --> 00:15:13.192
Eric Larson was my mentor
and what a wonderful man.


309
00:15:13.194 --> 00:15:20.024
He was kind and
grandfatherly, yet very firm


310
00:15:20.026 --> 00:15:23.092
about how you go
about doing this.


311
00:15:23.094 --> 00:15:26.891
And I was so overwhelmed
with the idea of what it


312
00:15:26.893 --> 00:15:30.326
took to even just flip paper.

313
00:15:30.328 --> 00:15:32.458
I got sick that first
week because it was just,


314
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.958
oh my gosh, what's going on?

315
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.491
Can I do this?

316
00:15:35.493 --> 00:15:38.025
But Eric was very encouraging.

317
00:15:38.027 --> 00:15:41.092
And he stepped me
through the process.


318
00:15:41.094 --> 00:15:44.259
What he would always ask is,
what are you trying to do here?


319
00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:45.359
What are you trying to say?

320
00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:47.359
What is the character thinking?

321
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:51.326
And then you explain your
plans and your ideas.


322
00:15:51.328 --> 00:15:54.524
And then he said, "Oh OK."

323
00:15:54.526 --> 00:15:55.958
That's what you have in mind.

324
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.326
Then you don't
need this drawing.


325
00:15:58.328 --> 00:16:00.359
You do need this.

326
00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:02.125
"You do need a new drawing."

327
00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.326
He would throw in
two or three drawings


328
00:16:04.328 --> 00:16:06.092
that he would sketch out.

329
00:16:06.094 --> 00:16:08.490
And then you would
time this whole thing


330
00:16:08.492 --> 00:16:11.059
and film it and it was magical.

331
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:13.458
It worked.

332
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.958
We wouldn't even approach
animators that first year we


333
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.092
were at Disney.

334
00:16:17.094 --> 00:16:18.657
We wouldn't even
talk to an animator


335
00:16:18.659 --> 00:16:21.059
because they were
like gods to us.


336
00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:27.192
I worked with Milt Kahl on
his most favorite character,


337
00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:29.192
which was Medusa.

338
00:16:29.194 --> 00:16:31.924
And he had more fun
with that character when


339
00:16:31.926 --> 00:16:34.025
she pulls off her eyelashes.

340
00:16:34.027 --> 00:16:36.192
I don't know.

341
00:16:36.194 --> 00:16:37.125
He just really had fun
with that character


342
00:16:37.127 --> 00:16:40.025
and it was a joy
to work with him.


343
00:16:40.027 --> 00:16:42.590
When I started at Disney, Eric
Larson, one of the nine old men


344
00:16:42.592 --> 00:16:44.824
who had animated on
Snow White and that,


345
00:16:44.826 --> 00:16:46.125
literally would take a piece
of paper and put it over yours


346
00:16:46.127 --> 00:16:47.590
and draw over that.

347
00:16:47.592 --> 00:16:49.092
You had a one on one
experience of somebody


348
00:16:49.094 --> 00:16:51.557
who had spent years
honing his craft.


349
00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:54.624
I do think animation
we learned quickly


350
00:16:54.626 --> 00:16:57.757
was best taught as a sort of a
master apprentice type thing.


351
00:16:57.759 --> 00:17:01.924
I think the big guys,
the veterans, the masters,


352
00:17:01.926 --> 00:17:05.359
I think they suffered as much
as we did because keep in mind,


353
00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:07.857
even though these guys
were experienced animators,


354
00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.992
they had their moments too
when things didn't work out


355
00:17:09.994 --> 00:17:12.292
as well as they had expected.

356
00:17:12.294 --> 00:17:14.992
Now, I must say that,
for the most part,


357
00:17:14.994 --> 00:17:16.959
these guys knew they were
good but every now and then,


358
00:17:16.961 --> 00:17:18.392
they would push themselves.

359
00:17:18.394 --> 00:17:19.524
Frank would try something.

360
00:17:19.526 --> 00:17:21.657
Milt would try something.

361
00:17:21.659 --> 00:17:24.557
And if it worked, then
they were just delighted


362
00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:27.025
but they also pushed themselves.

363
00:17:27.027 --> 00:17:29.192
They didn't rest
on their laurels.


364
00:17:29.194 --> 00:17:31.524
They were always trying
to push the boundaries,


365
00:17:31.526 --> 00:17:34.225
trying to be better
than they were.


366
00:17:34.227 --> 00:17:40.359
So working side by side,
that's where we grow.


367
00:17:40.361 --> 00:17:43.557
As iron sharpens iron,
one man sharpens another,


368
00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:46.624
one woman sharpens another.

369
00:17:46.626 --> 00:17:51.359
It's the friction of learning.

370
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:54.192
Eric Larson, I would
present him problems that


371
00:17:54.194 --> 00:17:58.125
were when only you
would present me with,


372
00:17:58.127 --> 00:17:59.425
and it was as
close as I ever saw


373
00:17:59.427 --> 00:18:02.425
to Eric getting
angry because but he


374
00:18:02.427 --> 00:18:03.691
would sit down with this.

375
00:18:03.693 --> 00:18:04.824
"All right.

376
00:18:04.826 --> 00:18:06.259
I'm going to figure this out."

377
00:18:06.261 --> 00:18:09.624
And there's this
joy to learning.


378
00:18:09.626 --> 00:18:12.925
Walt Disney was a
pioneer in many ways


379
00:18:12.927 --> 00:18:17.959
and recognized what was
possible with this art form.


380
00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:19.757
That there really was
an unlimited ceiling


381
00:18:19.759 --> 00:18:22.159
to what could be done.

382
00:18:22.161 --> 00:18:25.025
But he had to push boundaries
with rather analog approaches.


383
00:18:25.027 --> 00:18:27.959
And indeed, he did
with early, very


384
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:31.824
basic technological advances.

385
00:18:31.826 --> 00:18:35.092
He even advanced with the
multiplane camera and later


386
00:18:35.094 --> 00:18:37.159
xerography.

387
00:18:37.161 --> 00:18:39.992
There were other studios that
were working in these areas


388
00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:43.624
as well, but he recognized in
order to keep the medium fresh,


389
00:18:43.626 --> 00:18:46.225
there needed to be advances.

390
00:18:46.227 --> 00:18:48.624
The advent of color
and where women's


391
00:18:48.626 --> 00:18:51.259
roles expanded in animation.

392
00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:53.691
I think people would
be surprised to know


393
00:18:53.693 --> 00:18:59.025
how many women there were
at Disney in the 1950s.


394
00:18:59.027 --> 00:19:01.791
So I think that's something
that young women should bear


395
00:19:01.793 --> 00:19:03.992
in mind because there were
a lot of talented women


396
00:19:03.994 --> 00:19:05.524
who mentored me.

397
00:19:05.526 --> 00:19:08.959
And I'm very grateful for that.

398
00:19:08.961 --> 00:19:11.992
I was putting myself through
school so I needed a job.


399
00:19:11.994 --> 00:19:15.524
And I was fortunate enough
to find out that Disney


400
00:19:15.526 --> 00:19:19.757
was hiring for Sleeping Beauty.

401
00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:22.657
And I went over there
with my meager portfolio.


402
00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:25.292
And they brought me on
as an apprentice working


403
00:19:25.293 --> 00:19:28.724
with six or seven other girls.

404
00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:30.259
And we were in a bullpen
all together, all of us


405
00:19:30.261 --> 00:19:32.757
apprentices.

406
00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:36.691
We had full access to
anybody and a lot of freedom


407
00:19:36.693 --> 00:19:40.159
for a first job in animation.

408
00:19:40.161 --> 00:19:43.925
It was pretty
incredible way to start.


409
00:19:43.927 --> 00:19:45.425
Mary was certainly
a giant at Disney.


410
00:19:45.427 --> 00:19:47.724
Good heavens.

411
00:19:47.726 --> 00:19:50.691
The film she influenced
during her time at Disney,


412
00:19:50.693 --> 00:19:53.724
and she was incredibly prolific.

413
00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:57.291
So Mary Blair, she was
a giant in animation.


414
00:19:57.293 --> 00:20:00.159
She was just incredible.

415
00:20:00.161 --> 00:20:03.159
WEN: After dominating the
animation world for decades,


416
00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:06.325
Disney's lack of
innovation and inability


417
00:20:06.327 --> 00:20:08.792
to keep up with the
times opened the door


418
00:20:08.794 --> 00:20:12.524
for some impressive
competition to step right in.


419
00:20:12.526 --> 00:20:15.291
There were young
people who were keenly


420
00:20:15.293 --> 00:20:19.490
interested in taking
on the mantle of Frank,


421
00:20:19.492 --> 00:20:21.524
and Ollie, and
all of those guys.


422
00:20:21.526 --> 00:20:23.959
But there was no
greater intelligence.


423
00:20:23.961 --> 00:20:30.025
There was no Walt to set a goal.

424
00:20:30.027 --> 00:20:31.992
Where do we want
to go with this?


425
00:20:31.994 --> 00:20:33.959
What do we want to try to do?

426
00:20:33.961 --> 00:20:37.159
What kind of stories do
we want to be telling?


427
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:39.557
And what's happening
to our audience?


428
00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:41.192
Is our audience changing?

429
00:20:41.194 --> 00:20:44.025
Because it was.

430
00:20:44.027 --> 00:20:47.291
We had a cultural, social
revolution in the late '60s,


431
00:20:47.293 --> 00:20:50.425
early '70s that was
reflected everywhere


432
00:20:50.427 --> 00:20:52.490
but perhaps the
Walt Disney studio.


433
00:20:52.492 --> 00:20:55.825
Easy Rider changed
the entire motion


434
00:20:55.827 --> 00:20:59.758
picture industry, except
that the Walt Disney studio.


435
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.825
It's no one's fault. It's
just they were out of step


436
00:21:03.827 --> 00:21:07.624
and there was no one
to put them on a course


437
00:21:07.626 --> 00:21:09.590
that everyone could agree on.

438
00:21:09.592 --> 00:21:11.425
Don Bluth, he's a pretty
amazing success story.


439
00:21:11.427 --> 00:21:14.125
I knew who Don Bluth was.

440
00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:16.959
Most kids didn't, there was
no internet but that was huge.


441
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:19.725
Because you had a Disney
animator who drew in the Disney


442
00:21:19.727 --> 00:21:22.524
style stepping outside
the system and going like,


443
00:21:22.526 --> 00:21:23.425
"I think I could
do it elsewhere."


444
00:21:23.427 --> 00:21:26.059
I don't need them.

445
00:21:26.061 --> 00:21:29.025
When we left Disney
Studios in '79, it


446
00:21:29.027 --> 00:21:31.624
was a scary
situation and equally


447
00:21:31.626 --> 00:21:33.725
exhilarating and exciting.

448
00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:37.059
Those two elements,
they're just propelled


449
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:42.224
us into our first feature film
together, The Secret of NIMH.


450
00:21:42.226 --> 00:21:44.490
I must tell you about NIMH.

451
00:21:44.492 --> 00:21:45.492
Look there.

452
00:21:49.427 --> 00:21:51.758
It was a crazy
brave thing to do.


453
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.858
And I know that many of
my younger colleagues


454
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.992
that I've worked
with, that movie


455
00:21:56.994 --> 00:21:59.325
inspired them to
get into animation,


456
00:21:59.327 --> 00:22:03.191
which I really I'm so pleased.

457
00:22:03.193 --> 00:22:06.725
Mavericks, renegades who are
happy to push at the system


458
00:22:06.727 --> 00:22:10.224
and see how far they
can take their own art.


459
00:22:10.226 --> 00:22:13.992
Starting within the system and
taking their art outside of it


460
00:22:13.994 --> 00:22:17.124
for their own benefit as opposed
to just working for somebody


461
00:22:17.126 --> 00:22:20.258
else is in the creative DNA
of every indie filmmaker,


462
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.224
I would say.

463
00:22:22.226 --> 00:22:24.590
Sadly enough, it didn't do
very well at the Box Office.


464
00:22:24.592 --> 00:22:26.925
And that summer, we
were up against ET,


465
00:22:26.927 --> 00:22:29.557
the extra-terrestrial
which everybody saw.


466
00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:32.892
They saw no other
movie except ET.


467
00:22:32.894 --> 00:22:36.725
The irony there is that
one of the greatest


468
00:22:36.727 --> 00:22:40.524
fans for The Secret of
NIMH was Steven Spielberg.


469
00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.557
He came and visited
us at our studio


470
00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:45.925
and said, "Guys,
your film is amazing.


471
00:22:45.927 --> 00:22:49.457
I thought that type of
animation storytelling was dead.


472
00:22:49.459 --> 00:22:52.425
I haven't seen anything like
that since Pinocchio or Bambi.


473
00:22:52.427 --> 00:22:53.591
It was phenomenal."

474
00:22:53.593 --> 00:22:55.457
He loved the minutia.

475
00:22:55.459 --> 00:22:57.892
He loved all of
the little details


476
00:22:57.894 --> 00:23:00.457
that we put in with
sparkles, and dewdrops,


477
00:23:00.459 --> 00:23:02.258
and animation effects.

478
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.425
Everything that we poured
our hearts in artistically,


479
00:23:05.427 --> 00:23:08.325
he picked up on and he loved it.

480
00:23:08.327 --> 00:23:09.758
I remember it well.

481
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.391
Somebody had to run
to Jerry's Deli.


482
00:23:11.393 --> 00:23:12.291
What does he like?

483
00:23:12.293 --> 00:23:14.692
What does he want?

484
00:23:14.694 --> 00:23:18.825
But it was just, oh
my goodness, this well


485
00:23:18.827 --> 00:23:20.725
known director is here
looking at our work


486
00:23:20.727 --> 00:23:23.224
and really enjoying it.

487
00:23:23.226 --> 00:23:28.725
But yes, it moved on
with an American tail.


488
00:23:28.727 --> 00:23:31.325
It's about a little
family of Russian mice


489
00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:34.925
that immigrate from Europe to
the United States to New York


490
00:23:34.927 --> 00:23:37.191
just as they're finishing
the Statue of Liberty.


491
00:23:37.193 --> 00:23:38.925
Perfect.

492
00:23:38.927 --> 00:23:41.825
Won't it be nice
to get to America


493
00:23:41.827 --> 00:23:43.625
where we don't have to
worry about cats anymore?


494
00:23:43.627 --> 00:23:46.058
We had landed.

495
00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.792
We were on the map making
a movie with that kind


496
00:23:47.794 --> 00:23:54.658
of support and the talent.

497
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.425
James Horner, and Score,
and Linda Ronstadt.


498
00:23:56.427 --> 00:23:59.058
It was wonderful.

499
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.525
It was wonderful
working in collaboration


500
00:24:01.527 --> 00:24:04.124
with Steven Spielberg.

501
00:24:04.126 --> 00:24:06.925
All the studios began thinking
we've got to get into that.


502
00:24:06.927 --> 00:24:09.792
We've got to jump in with
our own animation studio


503
00:24:09.794 --> 00:24:12.124
and compete because
that makes money.


504
00:24:12.126 --> 00:24:14.992
And that changed
the whole complexion


505
00:24:14.994 --> 00:24:19.758
of not just domestic animation,
but worldwide animation.


506
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.858
I think, the lover of animation,

507
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.325
it was the first time
where we were like,


508
00:24:23.327 --> 00:24:26.024
oh, something's happening.

509
00:24:26.026 --> 00:24:29.224
Something magical is
happening over there.


510
00:24:29.226 --> 00:24:32.224
WEN: We were embarking
upon the second golden age


511
00:24:32.226 --> 00:24:34.591
of 2D animation.

512
00:24:34.593 --> 00:24:36.858
It was exciting
and groundbreaking,


513
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.491
and connected deeply with
a whole new generation


514
00:24:39.493 --> 00:24:42.291
of both kids and adults.

515
00:24:42.293 --> 00:24:45.525
A resetting and recalibration
of the executive command


516
00:24:45.527 --> 00:24:48.058
at Disney happened.

517
00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.825
The old regime was removed
and replaced with Roy Disney.


518
00:24:51.827 --> 00:24:54.191
I don't think it's
an exaggeration


519
00:24:54.193 --> 00:24:58.858
to say that Roy Edward Disney
saved animation, and helped


520
00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:01.591
reinvent and redefine it.

521
00:25:01.593 --> 00:25:05.525
And that's the premise of Don
Juan's wonderful documentary,


522
00:25:05.527 --> 00:25:07.425
Waking Sleeping Beauty.

523
00:25:07.427 --> 00:25:12.692
And here finally was someone
in the person of Howard Ashman,


524
00:25:12.694 --> 00:25:15.792
the brilliant
lyricist and Broadway


525
00:25:15.794 --> 00:25:19.792
trained talent who gave
everyone a direction.


526
00:25:19.794 --> 00:25:22.258
Gave everyone a goal
and a path to follow.


527
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.325
And who would have dreamed that
it was the Broadway Musical,


528
00:25:25.327 --> 00:25:30.925
the form of the Broadway
musical that would redefine


529
00:25:30.927 --> 00:25:34.325
what Disney Animation could be.

530
00:25:34.327 --> 00:25:39.725
I remember when we went
to see Little Mermaid.


531
00:25:39.727 --> 00:25:42.958
And it was like,
oh, suddenly they


532
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.625
had this formula where
it's, oh the animation


533
00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:48.358
looks like Disney.

534
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:48.558
And they're all singing songs
and the songs are singable.


535
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.692
And this is fun.

536
00:25:50.694 --> 00:25:52.426
So those songs are
classics and it's


537
00:25:52.428 --> 00:25:55.991
just the epitome of really
great Broadway songwriting.


538
00:25:55.993 --> 00:25:58.091
And I mean, there
are some people


539
00:25:58.093 --> 00:26:00.291
who say it's the last
great Broadway songwriting.


540
00:26:00.293 --> 00:26:05.991
And that was the rebirth
of the Disney animated epic.


541
00:26:05.993 --> 00:26:10.224
There are chapters
with every studio.


542
00:26:10.226 --> 00:26:16.558
And there has to be a continuum
of energy, and new ideas,


543
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.191
and what have you.

544
00:26:18.193 --> 00:26:21.491
And it was starting
to happen back


545
00:26:21.493 --> 00:26:22.991
at Disney with Little Mermaid.

546
00:26:22.993 --> 00:26:25.924
And we knew what was going on.

547
00:26:25.926 --> 00:26:30.024
Little Mermaid, that
was the, it's back.


548
00:26:30.026 --> 00:26:33.024
Whatever the magic that we
lost, it's now fully back.


549
00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:36.291
And you could see
the confidence.


550
00:26:36.293 --> 00:26:40.458
And you could see this artistry
that acknowledged the past


551
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.191
but was creating their own path.

552
00:26:42.193 --> 00:26:45.258
They call the '90s and the 2000

553
00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.591
the second golden age or the
new renaissance of animation.


554
00:26:47.593 --> 00:26:48.958
And it really was.

555
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.924
And why I think it
was the nine old men


556
00:26:52.926 --> 00:26:56.224
had passed on what
they learned making


557
00:26:56.226 --> 00:26:58.224
those classic Disney films.

558
00:26:58.226 --> 00:27:02.792
And they'd pass it on to
that second generation.


559
00:27:02.794 --> 00:27:05.224
And that second
generation, right


560
00:27:05.226 --> 00:27:09.224
around the '90s and the

561
00:27:09.226 --> 00:27:11.258
We were all just super
excited at the time to be


562
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.525
working on a series of films.

563
00:27:13.527 --> 00:27:16.924
By that point, people started
to realize that we were working


564
00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:19.792
on a series of films
which were doing well


565
00:27:19.794 --> 00:27:21.392
and people were
really responding to.


566
00:27:21.394 --> 00:27:24.359
Back at the beginning of that
period like Little Mermaid,


567
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:28.392
everyone was more like, "We just
have to keep this thing going."


568
00:27:28.394 --> 00:27:29.792
We were trying to do a movie
that would please ourselves


569
00:27:29.794 --> 00:27:32.426
and you never know.

570
00:27:32.428 --> 00:27:34.491
It's amazing and I didn't think
you 30 years after we made.


571
00:27:34.493 --> 00:27:36.824
Little Mermaid that there
would be people and little kids


572
00:27:36.826 --> 00:27:39.326
discovering the movie.

573
00:27:39.328 --> 00:27:41.359
But they're doing what I did
with Pinocchio which is great.


574
00:27:41.361 --> 00:27:44.158
I saw Pinocchio and I had
no idea it was from 20 years


575
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.525
before I saw it in a
theater that had been made.


576
00:27:46.527 --> 00:27:49.891
I think at the time, many of us

577
00:27:49.893 --> 00:27:52.958
animators, we had no
idea that we were living


578
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.725
through the second golden age.

579
00:27:54.727 --> 00:27:56.258
That's the kind
of thing you don't


580
00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.692
know until you look back on.

581
00:27:57.694 --> 00:28:00.292
Competition breeds excellence.

582
00:28:00.294 --> 00:28:05.258
So I think us leaving,
having a competition out


583
00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.692
there is what helped this
animation renaissance


584
00:28:07.694 --> 00:28:09.924
that Disney was experiencing.

585
00:28:09.926 --> 00:28:14.024
So they had the character
design as a given.


586
00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:18.158
But what they did with it
was new, and inventive,


587
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.458
and crowd pleasing.

588
00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.824
The stories are relatable,
the characters are relatable.


589
00:28:23.826 --> 00:28:25.491
You can project
yourself into the story.


590
00:28:25.493 --> 00:28:28.091
The conflicts that
are universal.


591
00:28:28.093 --> 00:28:30.091
A kid dealing with an
overprotective parent.


592
00:28:30.093 --> 00:28:31.558
Is that story ever
going to get old?


593
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.259
We didn't invent that story.

594
00:28:33.261 --> 00:28:34.924
That story has been around
for thousands of years.


595
00:28:34.926 --> 00:28:37.024
It's part of the
nature of growing up.


596
00:28:37.026 --> 00:28:38.824
I think the stories in
the '90s that we did,


597
00:28:38.826 --> 00:28:41.426
they tapped into
universal classic ideas


598
00:28:41.428 --> 00:28:43.558
that don't go away.

599
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.891
Well, I got to say the thing
that I love about animation


600
00:28:46.893 --> 00:28:50.191
is animating
characters that believe


601
00:28:50.193 --> 00:28:52.625
the impossible is possible.

602
00:28:52.627 --> 00:28:57.491
Ariel wanting to walk on land.

603
00:28:57.493 --> 00:28:58.227
I want more.

604
00:29:02.593 --> 00:29:03.991
Beast thinking
that somebody could


605
00:29:03.993 --> 00:29:11.591
see past the ugly exterior
and see somebody to love.


606
00:29:11.593 --> 00:29:14.225
I thought I saw,
and when we touched


607
00:29:14.227 --> 00:29:17.058
she didn't shudder at my part.

608
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.724
I find that fascinating.

609
00:29:18.726 --> 00:29:20.326
It's seeing beyond.

610
00:29:20.328 --> 00:29:22.292
I was a brand new animator.

611
00:29:22.294 --> 00:29:25.191
I wasn't very good, but
I was working hard at it.


612
00:29:25.193 --> 00:29:29.091
And it was time to work
on Beauty and the Beast.


613
00:29:29.093 --> 00:29:32.426
And Glenn was
animating the beast.


614
00:29:32.428 --> 00:29:36.359
Animator by the name of Mark
Henn was animating Belle.


615
00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:38.225
And he asked me if I would
be the Florida beast guy.


616
00:29:38.227 --> 00:29:39.591
And so I said, "OK."

617
00:29:39.593 --> 00:29:40.958
But I was really nervous.

618
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.158
The beast is a
complex character.


619
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.558
He's a main character of
the film and I was 21 or 22,


620
00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.991
and really not that
good but eager.


621
00:29:49.993 --> 00:29:51.225
And one of the great
things about Glenn


622
00:29:51.227 --> 00:29:54.091
is not only his abilities
and all of that,


623
00:29:54.093 --> 00:29:56.558
but his generosity.

624
00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.426
His generosity of giving you
work that can really make you


625
00:29:57.428 --> 00:29:59.558
shine.

626
00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.426
And I remember he gave me this
sequence in the film where


627
00:30:02.428 --> 00:30:04.558
beast is being
bandaged by Belle,


628
00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.525
but he gave me the
whole sequence.


629
00:30:06.527 --> 00:30:09.525
And I remember looking at
this going, "I can't do this.


630
00:30:09.527 --> 00:30:10.558
I can't do it.

631
00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.091
This is not going to happen."

632
00:30:12.093 --> 00:30:13.958
And I was so scared.

633
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.891
And that's the other
thing he always did.


634
00:30:15.893 --> 00:30:19.857
Is he always had faith in all
of us that worked with him.


635
00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:23.458
Over the span of
time, you'd be here


636
00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.991
and he'd bring you up to here.

637
00:30:24.993 --> 00:30:26.924
Now, hold still.

638
00:30:26.926 --> 00:30:27.525
This might sting a little.

639
00:30:27.527 --> 00:30:28.491
Hmm?

640
00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:31.958
[groans]

641
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.926
By the way, thank
you for saving my life.


642
00:30:40.093 --> 00:30:41.591
You're welcome.

643
00:30:41.593 --> 00:30:43.924
We worked on
Beauty and the Beast


644
00:30:43.926 --> 00:30:47.225
and that got an Academy Award
nomination for the first time.


645
00:30:47.227 --> 00:30:49.259
No other animated film
had ever gotten that.


646
00:30:49.261 --> 00:30:52.724
And here are the nominees
for the best picture.


647
00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:54.591
Beauty and the Beast,
Don Hahn producer.


648
00:30:54.593 --> 00:30:59.591
[clapping]

649
00:30:59.593 --> 00:31:01.891
And that was a big
deal at the time.


650
00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:05.960
Well deserved but that sent
a panic through the academy.


651
00:31:09.826 --> 00:31:12.092
And some people thought this was

652
00:31:12.094 --> 00:31:17.724
going to open all sorts of doors
but the academy closed ranks.


653
00:31:17.726 --> 00:31:19.924
We don't want the
animated films to be


654
00:31:19.926 --> 00:31:24.092
competing directly head to
head with live action movies.


655
00:31:24.094 --> 00:31:25.824
They have their place
and we love them,


656
00:31:25.826 --> 00:31:27.259
but they have their place.

657
00:31:27.261 --> 00:31:29.392
We didn't make it.

658
00:31:29.394 --> 00:31:32.590
We lost that, but we got
a Golden Globe that year.


659
00:31:32.592 --> 00:31:35.525
And then Aladdin comes out and
it got really huge acclaim.


660
00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:38.092
Robin Williams, and the
genie, and all of that.


661
00:31:38.094 --> 00:31:41.024
But then we make this
little movie, Lion King.


662
00:31:41.026 --> 00:31:43.757
The Lion King may
have the last roar.


663
00:31:43.759 --> 00:31:45.824
Beauty and the Beast and
Aladdin breathed new life


664
00:31:45.826 --> 00:31:47.092
into the Disney Kingdom.

665
00:31:47.094 --> 00:31:50.359
I remember how
massive that movie was.


666
00:31:50.361 --> 00:31:53.292
And the night that we
went to see Lion King,


667
00:31:53.294 --> 00:31:54.458
we didn't go to a matinee.

668
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.225
We went at night, 7:00 at night.

669
00:31:56.227 --> 00:31:58.392
Sold the [bleep] out.

670
00:31:58.394 --> 00:32:00.724
That had never happened
before for a cartoon movie.


671
00:32:00.726 --> 00:32:03.426
It really was the
movie that brought


672
00:32:03.428 --> 00:32:05.458
adults into the theaters.

673
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.259
They were coming in droves.

674
00:32:07.261 --> 00:32:08.924
They were happy to come
back over and over again


675
00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:10.458
with their kids.

676
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.392
And so that's why that blew up.

677
00:32:12.394 --> 00:32:13.691
That's why it became
$1 billion film.


678
00:32:13.693 --> 00:32:15.192
Circle of life.

679
00:32:15.194 --> 00:32:17.691
Everybody knew that.

680
00:32:17.693 --> 00:32:20.791
It made us feel OK about
eating animals for a long time.


681
00:32:20.793 --> 00:32:21.958
I'm a vegan now but
when I was a kid,


682
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.491
it was like, wow,
circle of life.


683
00:32:23.493 --> 00:32:25.724
They said it in that movie.

684
00:32:25.726 --> 00:32:27.926
And the Oscar goes to is
Hans Zimmer for the Lion King.


685
00:32:32.194 --> 00:32:35.624
Winner of the Oscar is,

686
00:32:35.626 --> 00:32:36.791
Elton John and Tim Rice.

687
00:32:36.793 --> 00:32:38.027
Can you feel the love tonight?

688
00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:49.159
That officially made animation
this second golden age.


689
00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:50.757
It was official at that
point, when you had


690
00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:53.891
a more than $1 billion film.

691
00:32:53.893 --> 00:32:57.092
It was an animation boom and
it was all because of money.


692
00:32:57.094 --> 00:33:00.791
Animation directors
suddenly had agents.


693
00:33:00.793 --> 00:33:03.958
Everything about the
business changed.


694
00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:10.857
Simultaneously, television
animation enjoyed a rebirth.


695
00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:14.590
Steven Spielberg gave it a
kick in the right direction


696
00:33:14.592 --> 00:33:18.992
with Tiny Toon and Animaniacs,
and demanded a certain level


697
00:33:18.994 --> 00:33:23.724
of quality that no one had seen
in television animation before.


698
00:33:23.726 --> 00:33:28.557
Followed by The Simpsons
where again, it was not just


699
00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:30.691
the quality of the animation.

700
00:33:30.693 --> 00:33:33.125
In fact, barely the
quality of the animation.


701
00:33:33.127 --> 00:33:36.490
The quality of the
timing of the animation


702
00:33:36.492 --> 00:33:39.891
too great script writing.

703
00:33:39.893 --> 00:33:43.524
I will never forget watching
the first Simpsons carton show.


704
00:33:43.526 --> 00:33:47.657
And Marge Simpson going...

705
00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:48.657
Do you hear that?

706
00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:49.392
What dear?

707
00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:50.857
The punching bag.

708
00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:52.557
They're just playing, Homer.

709
00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:54.425
I can't sleep with that racket.

710
00:33:54.427 --> 00:33:55.590
Go tell him to knock it off.

711
00:33:55.592 --> 00:33:58.192
I like the punching bag sound.

712
00:33:58.194 --> 00:34:01.959
I like the punching
bag sound destroyed us.


713
00:34:01.961 --> 00:34:04.292
It was literally the funniest
thing we'd ever heard.


714
00:34:04.294 --> 00:34:07.025
It was like watching
the birth of new comedy.


715
00:34:07.027 --> 00:34:12.059
The Simpsons dominated most
of my free time from 1989


716
00:34:12.061 --> 00:34:14.757
I think when it
debuted all the way up


717
00:34:14.759 --> 00:34:18.824
until I made Clerks and
probably a few years past that.


718
00:34:18.826 --> 00:34:22.159
That was the cultural
stew that fed


719
00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:24.159
and nourished me before
I went and became


720
00:34:24.161 --> 00:34:27.326
a pop culturist myself.

721
00:34:27.328 --> 00:34:30.059
I was well prepared
and armed because I'd


722
00:34:30.061 --> 00:34:33.524
watched a decade of
Simpsons by the time I was


723
00:34:33.526 --> 00:34:36.557
entering the public discourse.

724
00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:38.624
It teaches you to be quick.

725
00:34:38.626 --> 00:34:40.857
It teaches you what
great writing is.


726
00:34:40.859 --> 00:34:44.259
I attribute a lot of Family
Guy's emergence to everybody


727
00:34:44.261 --> 00:34:46.292
wanted animation.

728
00:34:46.294 --> 00:34:47.225
They wanted exactly
this kind of animation.


729
00:34:47.227 --> 00:34:50.590
So I was pitching at
exactly the right time.


730
00:34:50.592 --> 00:34:53.524
Exactly the right tone of show.

731
00:34:53.526 --> 00:34:57.326
They wanted something that
was going to do for them what.


732
00:34:57.328 --> 00:34:58.359
The Simpsons had done
and what King of the Hill


733
00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.925
was doing at the time.

734
00:35:00.927 --> 00:35:04.757
Sort of experimenting with
the traditions that we've been


735
00:35:04.759 --> 00:35:07.657
taught, but now taking in
a new generation taking it


736
00:35:07.659 --> 00:35:11.092
a new direction was really
what the '90s and 2000s


737
00:35:11.094 --> 00:35:12.791
were all about.

738
00:35:12.793 --> 00:35:14.992
WEN: And just when
animation seemed


739
00:35:14.994 --> 00:35:18.590
to be taking over the
world with no end in sight,


740
00:35:18.592 --> 00:35:20.925
a new technique
was on the horizon,


741
00:35:20.927 --> 00:35:24.326
computer-generated animation.

742
00:35:24.328 --> 00:35:27.590
No one, especially the
animators themselves,


743
00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:30.858
had any idea how this
would change everything


744
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.992
and change it so quickly.

745
00:35:33.994 --> 00:35:38.092
Right after The Fox and the
Hound, John Lasseter, and I


746
00:35:38.094 --> 00:35:40.858
had gone across
the little whatever


747
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.325
dopey drive there to the
Disney Animation theater there.


748
00:35:43.327 --> 00:35:47.059
And we saw Tron.

749
00:35:47.061 --> 00:35:51.657
They were just doing some
initial experimental animation,


750
00:35:51.659 --> 00:35:54.059
and Bill Kroyer, Jerry Reese.

751
00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:57.059
Who they were working on some
stuff with these light cycles.


752
00:35:57.061 --> 00:36:03.659
And we came back to my office
and sat there just depressed.


753
00:36:04.659 --> 00:36:08.557
Whoa, there's so much dimension.

754
00:36:08.559 --> 00:36:10.959
We just did The
Fox and the Hound


755
00:36:10.961 --> 00:36:15.757
and we had one multi-plane
shot we could use in the movie.


756
00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:20.959
And there, every shot is
multi-plane dimensional.


757
00:36:20.961 --> 00:36:24.425
Wouldn't it be cool if we
could design a little story


758
00:36:24.427 --> 00:36:26.291
that could use that.

759
00:36:26.293 --> 00:36:28.291
And so we did this
little Wild Things test


760
00:36:28.293 --> 00:36:31.959
where we designed the
backgrounds to move,


761
00:36:31.961 --> 00:36:34.959
but we knew that we couldn't
do the characters so yet in CG


762
00:36:34.961 --> 00:36:36.892
but we could do the backgrounds.

763
00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:38.925
So John worked with
the backgrounds


764
00:36:38.927 --> 00:36:41.624
and I animated the characters,
moving in dimension,


765
00:36:41.626 --> 00:36:44.557
and that was our
first step into CG.


766
00:36:44.559 --> 00:36:48.159
And it was so wonderful.

767
00:36:48.161 --> 00:36:51.490
We wanted to actually propose to
animating Wild Things to Disney


768
00:36:51.492 --> 00:36:54.624
but we couldn't get
the rights to it.


769
00:36:54.626 --> 00:36:58.758
Eventually, John was
fired from Disney.


770
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.959
I don't know what
happened to the guy.


771
00:37:01.961 --> 00:37:03.792
Did something with
Pixar or whatever.


772
00:37:03.794 --> 00:37:08.959
What became Pixar Animation
Studios was originally


773
00:37:08.961 --> 00:37:12.059
an experimental
division of Lucasfilm


774
00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:15.224
and George Lucas and
his friend Steve Jobs


775
00:37:15.226 --> 00:37:20.590
had equal degree of interest
in the possibilities that this


776
00:37:20.592 --> 00:37:23.524
new approach presented to them.

777
00:37:23.526 --> 00:37:26.125
I don't think they
fully envisioned


778
00:37:26.127 --> 00:37:30.092
what it would become, but they
knew there was something there.


779
00:37:30.094 --> 00:37:34.358
I heard about this incredible
group of computer graphics


780
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.325
specialists that George Lucas
had assembled at Lucasfilm,


781
00:37:37.327 --> 00:37:39.624
that he wanted to sell.

782
00:37:39.626 --> 00:37:41.325
And so I went up there and
saw what they were doing


783
00:37:41.327 --> 00:37:46.425
and I met the the leader of
this group, Dr. Ed Catmull.


784
00:37:46.427 --> 00:37:50.524
WEN: In 1972, Ed
Catmull and Fred Parke


785
00:37:50.526 --> 00:37:53.858
created the world's
first 3D rendered


786
00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.025
movie, an animated
version of Ed's left hand.


787
00:37:59.027 --> 00:38:01.391
The pioneering
techniques used here


788
00:38:01.393 --> 00:38:04.258
are the basis for

789
00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:10.224
still do today in video games,
movies, and visual effects.


790
00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:13.624
A film that came out
was Great Mouse Detective.


791
00:38:13.626 --> 00:38:16.224
And there was the
first foray into doing


792
00:38:16.226 --> 00:38:20.792
computer animation in the Big
Ben sequence in that film.


793
00:38:20.794 --> 00:38:25.725
And that was a one
engineer and one animator


794
00:38:25.727 --> 00:38:31.059
in the basement of the
main lot with a computer,


795
00:38:31.061 --> 00:38:34.959
just doing it, not
having any roadmap.


796
00:38:34.961 --> 00:38:36.892
They built the gears
in the computer.


797
00:38:36.894 --> 00:38:41.792
They printed them out
on a sheet feed plotter.


798
00:38:41.794 --> 00:38:45.590
Hand fed the 24 field paper.

799
00:38:45.592 --> 00:38:48.325
And because our
goal at the time was


800
00:38:48.327 --> 00:38:52.959
we are the legacy of a 60-year
history of 2D animated films,


801
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:55.425
the real design
goal is that this


802
00:38:55.427 --> 00:38:58.959
needs to blend in seamlessly.

803
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:01.625
You can't tell how this is
done to celebrate the Walt


804
00:39:01.627 --> 00:39:03.892
Disney traditional medium.

805
00:39:03.894 --> 00:39:06.858
So it was printed on
paper, Xerox on cels,


806
00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.658
hand-painted, shot
at our camera,


807
00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.358
just like every other
element in the film.


808
00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.526
[ticking]

809
00:39:30.526 --> 00:39:32.591
Based on the
success of that film,


810
00:39:32.593 --> 00:39:35.858
they went on to
buy one computer.


811
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.457
And they put it in the
animation department.


812
00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:40.158
It wasn't in the
basement somewhere


813
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.758
with wavefront software.

814
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.959
And like a seed, they
just put it there.


815
00:39:45.961 --> 00:39:48.725
And we had an engineer
and some tech people who


816
00:39:48.727 --> 00:39:53.158
knew how these things operated.

817
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.625
And they started to get the
animators interested in it.


818
00:39:57.627 --> 00:40:00.892
It really was the
Wild West of software,


819
00:40:00.894 --> 00:40:05.124
and technology, and materials.

820
00:40:05.126 --> 00:40:10.825
And literally
grappling and pivoting,


821
00:40:10.827 --> 00:40:12.725
and making it up as you went
along through the course


822
00:40:12.727 --> 00:40:13.593
of this time frame.

823
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.725
Technology is always a
tool to serve the art form.


824
00:40:21.727 --> 00:40:25.191
And in many cases
in the trajectory


825
00:40:25.193 --> 00:40:29.524
of animation history, technology
was there to save costs.


826
00:40:29.526 --> 00:40:31.591
In order to keep
the industry alive,


827
00:40:31.593 --> 00:40:34.258
you have that
example in everything


828
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:40.191
from xerography, where it
helped the cost of having


829
00:40:40.193 --> 00:40:43.058
an entire division
of hundreds of inkers


830
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:46.425
taking hours and hours to
carefully hand ink cels


831
00:40:46.427 --> 00:40:49.024
which was incredible artistry.

832
00:40:49.026 --> 00:40:51.191
But suddenly when you
have several Xerox cameras


833
00:40:51.193 --> 00:40:53.358
and teams working,
you could accomplish


834
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.758
close to 1,000 cels a day.

835
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.925
A single anchor might
get about 15 or 20 cels


836
00:40:59.927 --> 00:41:02.658
done a day if they were fast.

837
00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.625
So it was a tremendous
cost savings.


838
00:41:04.627 --> 00:41:05.892
Ink and paint was
one of the largest


839
00:41:05.894 --> 00:41:08.191
departments in our pipeline.

840
00:41:08.193 --> 00:41:12.024
They had been developing a
digital ink and paint system


841
00:41:12.026 --> 00:41:14.591
called CAPS, computer
animation production system,


842
00:41:14.593 --> 00:41:17.158
to scan, and paint,
and composite.


843
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.358
And we used The Little
Mermaid, the last shot


844
00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.525
of the film to test it out.

845
00:41:22.527 --> 00:41:25.193
[music playing]

846
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.525
And from then on, we
integrated it in every film


847
00:41:37.527 --> 00:41:40.158
after that.

848
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.792
When that technology was
offered to the Disney Animation


849
00:41:45.794 --> 00:41:50.224
studio, they were intrigued.

850
00:41:50.226 --> 00:41:54.158
The younger element, the younger
minds there were intrigued


851
00:41:54.160 --> 00:42:00.191
and they adopted it for the
magic carpet in Aladdin.


852
00:42:00.193 --> 00:42:02.058
And being a part of
the process like that,


853
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.925
it really helped tell
the story about our...


854
00:42:04.927 --> 00:42:07.058
Because we did become
part of the problem


855
00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.625
solving where they might
come like in Aladdin,


856
00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:11.792
the tiger's head.

857
00:42:11.794 --> 00:42:13.725
It's going to rise
up out of the ground,


858
00:42:13.727 --> 00:42:15.858
and it's going to
be this big thing.


859
00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.426
The computer animators
and designers could then


860
00:42:19.428 --> 00:42:22.258
be involved and say, "Well,
you know what you can do,


861
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.191
is we could build
it in the computer,


862
00:42:24.193 --> 00:42:26.458
and we could render
it like sand."


863
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.694
[wind blowing]

864
00:42:36.527 --> 00:42:40.325
We were the only ones who
were doing this integration


865
00:42:40.327 --> 00:42:43.291
and it was a wonderful design
challenge, like the ballroom


866
00:42:43.293 --> 00:42:44.758
in Beauty and the Beast.

867
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.792
It was an added
story element and it


868
00:42:47.794 --> 00:42:49.491
had to be designed
so that it wouldn't


869
00:42:49.493 --> 00:42:50.858
trigger you out of the story.

870
00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.325
It's like, "Oh my God.

871
00:42:52.327 --> 00:42:52.658
What's that?

872
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.325
It's 3D."

873
00:42:55.327 --> 00:43:02.325
This idea of incorporating
technology into this art form


874
00:43:02.327 --> 00:43:05.858
that an entire company had
been built around for decades


875
00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.392
was a little intimidating.

876
00:43:08.394 --> 00:43:12.024
And the powers that be made
the careful decision, perhaps


877
00:43:12.026 --> 00:43:15.191
wisely at the time,
to keep this idea


878
00:43:15.193 --> 00:43:17.325
of digital technology quiet.

879
00:43:17.327 --> 00:43:20.158
It was very important
that word did not get out


880
00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.958
that Disney, the home of
this great classic library


881
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.924
of animation, was
moving into computers.


882
00:43:28.926 --> 00:43:30.958
But it was the great
success of The Lion King.


883
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.224
They had proved
themselves over many years


884
00:43:33.226 --> 00:43:37.258
and many films as more
and more digital elements


885
00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:41.625
were being integrated that, OK,
audiences are ready to learn


886
00:43:41.627 --> 00:43:44.359
how we made this magic.

887
00:43:44.361 --> 00:43:49.091
Computer animation, to me,
was a way of feeling dimension


888
00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:52.658
and so I've always
embraced it for Tarzan.


889
00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:58.224
I wanted Tarzan to be
surfing on the trees.


890
00:43:58.226 --> 00:44:02.124
With Eric Daniels, we took
a section of a tree, turned


891
00:44:02.126 --> 00:44:06.558
it that way in space so that
I could imagine I'm Tarzan


892
00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.491
and he was moving
through the branches.


893
00:44:07.493 --> 00:44:08.891
I said, "OK.

894
00:44:08.893 --> 00:44:11.024
Now, I want to jump over there.

895
00:44:11.026 --> 00:44:12.392
Can you cut that branch
off and put it in space?"


896
00:44:12.394 --> 00:44:15.991
And he did and then I felt like
I could leap over to there.


897
00:44:15.993 --> 00:44:19.991
So we played this whole
action out of Tarzan


898
00:44:19.993 --> 00:44:22.891
and then they printed it
all out and gave it to me


899
00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:26.392
on photostats so I could
be Tarzan in space.


900
00:44:26.394 --> 00:44:30.258
And once again, it was giving
me a freedom to be the way


901
00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.426
I was picturing in my head.

902
00:44:32.428 --> 00:44:34.857
When I started working in
the computer animation which we


903
00:44:34.859 --> 00:44:38.258
hadn't really done
much of at school,


904
00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.891
I actually told John Lasseter
and everybody up here,


905
00:44:40.893 --> 00:44:42.158
"I don't know anything
about computers."


906
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.791
And they said, "Don't
worry, it's the same thing."


907
00:44:43.793 --> 00:44:46.158
And they were right.

908
00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.091
But it's different in
that hand-drawn animation,


909
00:44:50.093 --> 00:44:52.491
like I say, you feel
your way through.


910
00:44:52.493 --> 00:44:55.491
You draw it and
you can feel poses.


911
00:44:55.493 --> 00:44:58.525
And you can move from one frame
to another and you just sense.


912
00:44:58.527 --> 00:45:01.491
And you work by
feeling your way out.


913
00:45:01.493 --> 00:45:04.259
And with computers,
what I had to do


914
00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:07.326
is understand that and then
step back and analyze it,


915
00:45:07.328 --> 00:45:09.725
and break it down into levels.

916
00:45:09.727 --> 00:45:13.458
So it was much less intuitive.

917
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.259
It was a little more like taking
apart a lawnmower or something,


918
00:45:15.261 --> 00:45:17.158
which I'm also excited by.

919
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.891
So it was a fun place
to be and to start


920
00:45:19.893 --> 00:45:21.591
to figure out a lot
of stuff that had


921
00:45:21.593 --> 00:45:23.259
never been done at that point.

922
00:45:23.261 --> 00:45:26.958
I remember the first
time I saw a Pixar movie.


923
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.024
Actually, it wasn't
even the whole movie,


924
00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:31.326
the studio was screening
for all of us staff


925
00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:32.991
that were doing 2D animation.

926
00:45:32.993 --> 00:45:34.958
And we were working
on The Lion King.


927
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.658
We were right in the
middle of The Lion King


928
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.625
and they had a screening
of one sequence that was


929
00:45:38.627 --> 00:45:42.191
done by Pixar from Toy Story.

930
00:45:42.193 --> 00:45:43.625
And it was amazing.

931
00:45:43.627 --> 00:45:46.993
[music playing]

932
00:45:51.328 --> 00:45:52.757
Ha.

933
00:45:52.759 --> 00:45:53.392
Ha, what are you doing?

934
00:45:53.394 --> 00:45:54.359
I'm Tempus from morph.

935
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:55.458
Yeah.

936
00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.091
What's this button?

937
00:45:57.093 --> 00:45:59.158
And I remember walking
out of the theater


938
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.426
and talking to other
animators as we're


939
00:46:01.428 --> 00:46:04.458
walking back to our desks
to go work on The Lion King.


940
00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:09.426
And I remember saying, "That's
the end of 2D animation."


941
00:46:09.428 --> 00:46:13.924
But when I saw Toy Story man,
I had seen Pixar's Tin Toy was


942
00:46:13.926 --> 00:46:16.192
like, "How do they make
that lamp do that?"


943
00:46:16.194 --> 00:46:18.525
I was blown away.

944
00:46:18.527 --> 00:46:20.857
By the time Toy
Story came, it was


945
00:46:20.859 --> 00:46:23.924
incredible being
thrown into a world


946
00:46:23.926 --> 00:46:26.857
where everything
looked like that.


947
00:46:26.859 --> 00:46:29.691
Where it was one
gigantic CG cartoon.


948
00:46:29.693 --> 00:46:32.091
And nowadays, they make
humans that look like humans


949
00:46:32.093 --> 00:46:35.091
but back then, the
toys were easy to nail,


950
00:46:35.093 --> 00:46:38.192
the humans less so
but we didn't notice.


951
00:46:38.194 --> 00:46:40.192
We were all just so
amazed like that's crazy.


952
00:46:40.194 --> 00:46:41.091
Look at the texture on it.

953
00:46:41.093 --> 00:46:42.225
Look at the slinky dog.

954
00:46:42.227 --> 00:46:43.625
Look at Mr. Potato Head.

955
00:46:43.627 --> 00:46:45.691
It all tracks, it all works.

956
00:46:45.693 --> 00:46:46.791
And then you add to
it a wonderful story


957
00:46:46.793 --> 00:46:49.058
and fantastic voices.

958
00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.058
And the magic of what they
were able to accomplish


959
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.525
with the animation
is elevated trifold.


960
00:46:54.527 --> 00:46:56.124
Suddenly, you have
an instant classic


961
00:46:56.126 --> 00:47:00.292
that becomes a milestone
in animation history.


962
00:47:00.294 --> 00:47:02.359
Everything changes from
that point forward.


963
00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:05.791
When the movie came
out, it was mind blowing.


964
00:47:05.793 --> 00:47:08.159
I'd never seen anything like it.

965
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:09.991
It was like seeing Jurassic
Park for the first time.


966
00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:13.326
It was just a whole
new kind of filmmaking,


967
00:47:13.328 --> 00:47:16.259
and it was hugely impressive.

968
00:47:16.261 --> 00:47:21.159
I wouldn't call it sort
of a looming specter of CG.


969
00:47:21.161 --> 00:47:23.458
But there was
definitely this sort


970
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.857
of feeling like, gosh, I wonder
how far this is going to go.


971
00:47:26.859 --> 00:47:29.691
And people were
like, "Yeah, what's


972
00:47:29.693 --> 00:47:31.292
going to be like in 10 years."

973
00:47:31.294 --> 00:47:33.757
There was an awareness,
a definite awareness


974
00:47:33.759 --> 00:47:35.525
of what's this going
to be like in 10 years?


975
00:47:35.527 --> 00:47:37.691
Are we going to be here?

976
00:47:37.693 --> 00:47:39.125
Never in a million
years did I think it


977
00:47:39.127 --> 00:47:42.558
would completely eclipse
and devour the art


978
00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.225
of hand-drawn animation.

979
00:47:45.227 --> 00:47:49.525
By the end of that screening,
there were jaws dropped


980
00:47:49.527 --> 00:47:55.558
and realizations of, oh my
God, the power of this thing


981
00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.458
is too much.

982
00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.326
We have to evolve because
that is where it's going,


983
00:48:00.328 --> 00:48:04.624
and 2D as it is at that point,
especially at that time,


984
00:48:04.626 --> 00:48:07.159
was starting box
office wise to go down.


985
00:48:07.161 --> 00:48:09.757
It was the magic was
starting to fade,


986
00:48:09.759 --> 00:48:13.292
and I think everybody at
that time went CG animation.


987
00:48:13.294 --> 00:48:15.491
Go.

988
00:48:15.493 --> 00:48:17.058
Now, it took five more
years, probably five to seven


989
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.958
more years for it
actually to come true


990
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:22.326
but that was the
beginning of the end.


991
00:48:22.328 --> 00:48:25.791
Because they could do
things in CG and it


992
00:48:25.793 --> 00:48:28.691
was so new and
revolutionary at the time.


993
00:48:28.693 --> 00:48:30.924
The subtlety of acting
and performance,


994
00:48:30.926 --> 00:48:34.458
the camera that was moving
it had a more cinematic look,


995
00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.757
that I thought, are people going
to continue to see the films


996
00:48:37.759 --> 00:48:40.824
that we produce in
hand-drawn animation


997
00:48:40.826 --> 00:48:42.857
when there's this new technology
that's giving a higher level


998
00:48:42.859 --> 00:48:44.958
of sophistication animation?

999
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.624
When the R-Rex
started running down


1000
00:48:46.626 --> 00:48:49.426
the street in Jurassic
Park, we were working


1001
00:48:49.428 --> 00:48:50.924
on Lion King at the time.

1002
00:48:50.926 --> 00:48:52.724
And there really
was a little bit


1003
00:48:52.726 --> 00:48:57.259
of a sense of yep, that's over.

1004
00:48:57.261 --> 00:48:59.757
There was a little bit,
yeah, we're not going to get


1005
00:48:59.759 --> 00:49:02.225
to handle that stuff anymore.

1006
00:49:02.227 --> 00:49:03.524
That's done.

1007
00:49:03.526 --> 00:49:04.657
They were showing a sequence.

1008
00:49:04.659 --> 00:49:06.092
The army man sequence.

1009
00:49:06.094 --> 00:49:09.125
They showed at
Disney in Burbank.


1010
00:49:09.127 --> 00:49:10.791
They almost didn't know
what to make of it.


1011
00:49:10.793 --> 00:49:11.958
And they're like,
"Is this any good?"


1012
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.958
And we're like,
"Are you kidding?"


1013
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:13.958
This is a riot.

1014
00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.059
This is a blast.

1015
00:49:16.061 --> 00:49:18.292
We thought it was very cool that
we thought it was entertaining.


1016
00:49:18.294 --> 00:49:19.958
We thought it was entertaining
to the next level.


1017
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:23.259
We thought it worked
amazingly well.


1018
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:25.359
We were all super enthused.

1019
00:49:25.361 --> 00:49:27.557
We did not view it as a threat.

1020
00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:30.992
We just saw it as another way
to make a work of art or a film.


1021
00:49:30.994 --> 00:49:34.192
Just like there's painting and
there's sculpture, that they


1022
00:49:34.194 --> 00:49:36.458
could mutually coexist.

1023
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.259
We did not view it as a
threat that would somehow one


1024
00:49:38.261 --> 00:49:39.724
might replace the other.

1025
00:49:39.726 --> 00:49:41.225
Is this going to
replace hand-drawn?


1026
00:49:41.227 --> 00:49:42.924
And we were like, "No way."

1027
00:49:42.926 --> 00:49:44.490
This is a totally
separate medium.


1028
00:49:44.492 --> 00:49:46.958
It's a separate art form.

1029
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.292
I thought it was more
of a split in the road.


1030
00:49:50.294 --> 00:49:53.824
We have now a whole new
way of producing animation.


1031
00:49:53.826 --> 00:49:55.691
Other people with
different skill sets


1032
00:49:55.693 --> 00:49:57.192
can access animation.

1033
00:49:57.194 --> 00:49:58.326
That's great.
The more, the merrier.


1034
00:49:58.328 --> 00:50:00.392
That's awesome, right?

1035
00:50:00.394 --> 00:50:04.092
So I never assumed that
Hollywood would basically


1036
00:50:04.094 --> 00:50:08.426
consider it not a split but an
evolution, where you had to do


1037
00:50:08.428 --> 00:50:10.359
away with the old ways, right?

1038
00:50:10.361 --> 00:50:13.426
So it was around Treasure
Planet where it was


1039
00:50:13.428 --> 00:50:15.426
very clear what was happening.

1040
00:50:15.428 --> 00:50:18.524
And I remember having a
conversation with John Ripa.


1041
00:50:18.526 --> 00:50:21.326
We were both supervising
characters on that film


1042
00:50:21.328 --> 00:50:24.557
and saying, "Well, this
might be the last one we get


1043
00:50:24.559 --> 00:50:27.326
to make so let's make it count.

1044
00:50:27.328 --> 00:50:28.824
Let's go with a bang."

1045
00:50:28.826 --> 00:50:32.624
"And then we went
out with a bomb."


1046
00:50:32.626 --> 00:50:35.824
It covered a few
films, actually.


1047
00:50:35.826 --> 00:50:38.992
A period of DreamWorks and
Jeffrey Katzenberg weaning


1048
00:50:38.994 --> 00:50:42.159
themselves off of hand-drawn.

1049
00:50:42.161 --> 00:50:44.425
And I think just for
like box office reasons,


1050
00:50:44.427 --> 00:50:46.857
you know as much as anything
that was the bottom line.


1051
00:50:46.859 --> 00:50:49.225
The cost of making those films
was going higher and higher.


1052
00:50:49.227 --> 00:50:50.757
At the same time, the
box office revenues


1053
00:50:50.759 --> 00:50:52.824
were not necessarily
keeping pace


1054
00:50:52.826 --> 00:50:55.326
with that so that gap was
putting tremendous strains


1055
00:50:55.328 --> 00:50:58.025
on the films.

1056
00:50:58.027 --> 00:51:01.259
All the reasons they gave us
for why we should shift I never


1057
00:51:01.261 --> 00:51:03.857
bought into them.

1058
00:51:03.859 --> 00:51:08.292
They seemed based on very
flawed selective statistics.


1059
00:51:08.294 --> 00:51:12.590
2Ds not doing well,

1060
00:51:12.592 --> 00:51:14.959
that means the audiences
don't want to see 2D.


1061
00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:18.125
I was like, "Well, that's a very
selective way to look at it."


1062
00:51:18.127 --> 00:51:19.457
We would have teachers
come in and say,


1063
00:51:19.459 --> 00:51:21.326
"Guys, you've got to shift.

1064
00:51:21.328 --> 00:51:23.992
The world is changing."

1065
00:51:23.994 --> 00:51:26.925
The medium is being blamed for
these movies not doing well.


1066
00:51:26.927 --> 00:51:28.425
You're not factoring in
the quality of the stories


1067
00:51:28.427 --> 00:51:30.691
or the innovation.

1068
00:51:30.693 --> 00:51:32.992
Has nothing to do with
the medium, by the way.


1069
00:51:32.994 --> 00:51:36.724
It was rushing the stories and
the stories weren't connecting.


1070
00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:39.992
But people at the top,
especially the money people,


1071
00:51:39.994 --> 00:51:43.590
blame the medium and that I
think broke everybody's heart.


1072
00:51:43.592 --> 00:51:46.259
Well there's this myth out there

1073
00:51:46.261 --> 00:51:49.925
that 2D animation is it
takes longer to produce,


1074
00:51:49.927 --> 00:51:51.490
and it's more expensive,
and that's largely


1075
00:51:51.492 --> 00:51:53.524
why we don't do it anymore.

1076
00:51:53.526 --> 00:51:55.992
But that is a myth actually.

1077
00:51:55.994 --> 00:52:00.724
I've directed and 2D animated
feature Mulan at Disney,


1078
00:52:00.726 --> 00:52:03.657
but I've also been an animation
supervisor on a CG film,


1079
00:52:03.659 --> 00:52:06.590
Stuart Little 2 over at Sony.

1080
00:52:06.592 --> 00:52:08.892
So I've seen hands-on
from my perspective


1081
00:52:08.894 --> 00:52:11.092
and they're about the same.

1082
00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:12.959
It's just in 2D
animation, you can


1083
00:52:12.961 --> 00:52:14.490
get one drawing of a
character and start


1084
00:52:14.492 --> 00:52:16.657
animating from day one.

1085
00:52:16.659 --> 00:52:20.125
In CG animation, there's
a lot of crafting


1086
00:52:20.127 --> 00:52:22.292
of creating the
model, and the rig,


1087
00:52:22.294 --> 00:52:23.858
and how it's going to
move, and pre-planning


1088
00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.391
that goes into the model.

1089
00:52:25.393 --> 00:52:27.391
And then you can animate faster.

1090
00:52:27.393 --> 00:52:29.557
But when you put
them side to side,


1091
00:52:29.559 --> 00:52:31.557
those schedules
are about the same.


1092
00:52:31.559 --> 00:52:33.524
So the time is the
same and really


1093
00:52:33.526 --> 00:52:35.391
the money is the same too.

1094
00:52:35.393 --> 00:52:37.259
You have the same amount
of animators on a 2D film


1095
00:52:37.261 --> 00:52:39.892
as you do on a CG film.

1096
00:52:39.894 --> 00:52:44.259
There's just a swap of different
job titles and technology.


1097
00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:47.291
When DreamWorks released Shrek,

1098
00:52:47.293 --> 00:52:52.325
it was such an enormous hit that
the rest of the movie industry


1099
00:52:52.327 --> 00:52:55.825
said, "Oh, that's what
we should be doing,


1100
00:52:55.827 --> 00:52:58.325
and we can make
lots of money too.


1101
00:52:58.327 --> 00:53:00.691
And it all ought to be
dimensional animation.


1102
00:53:00.693 --> 00:53:05.259
The heck with this
pencil drawn stuff."


1103
00:53:05.261 --> 00:53:11.892
My contention is that Shrek was
a hit because it was hilarious.


1104
00:53:11.894 --> 00:53:16.192
It was a funny,
funny script enacted


1105
00:53:16.194 --> 00:53:22.358
by really talented people like
Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy.


1106
00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.425
And if it had been
animated with matchsticks,


1107
00:53:24.427 --> 00:53:26.291
it would have been a hit.

1108
00:53:26.293 --> 00:53:29.992
It was the content that
made it successful,


1109
00:53:29.994 --> 00:53:34.425
but the money people read
it as it was the look of it


1110
00:53:34.427 --> 00:53:36.925
that people wanted.

1111
00:53:36.927 --> 00:53:41.425
And that old 2D hand-drawn
stuff was out of fashion now.


1112
00:53:41.427 --> 00:53:44.025
Officially, it was over.

1113
00:53:44.027 --> 00:53:45.825
It was over.

1114
00:53:45.827 --> 00:53:52.059
Well, Pixar had been
acquired by Disney in 2005,


1115
00:53:52.061 --> 00:53:58.025
and then slowly they stopped
making the 2D animated films.


1116
00:53:58.027 --> 00:54:00.092
And we were really
sad to see those go.


1117
00:54:00.094 --> 00:54:03.725
I mean, that was a gain for us
to get those people with the 2D


1118
00:54:03.727 --> 00:54:05.792
hand-drawn experience,
and to see how they would


1119
00:54:05.794 --> 00:54:07.725
incorporate that into
their work and we


1120
00:54:07.727 --> 00:54:09.490
can be inspired by that too.

1121
00:54:09.492 --> 00:54:11.325
But it was very
sad to see the way


1122
00:54:11.327 --> 00:54:13.925
that the industry was going.

1123
00:54:13.927 --> 00:54:16.892
The industry was
going away from 2D


1124
00:54:16.894 --> 00:54:22.792
and I felt like that was a
real loss and a mistake too.


1125
00:54:22.794 --> 00:54:25.792
One, what's interesting
is it's a very common belief


1126
00:54:25.794 --> 00:54:28.925
that when computers come
into a new artistic medium,


1127
00:54:28.927 --> 00:54:32.792
there's something is it's
either less expensive,


1128
00:54:32.794 --> 00:54:37.059
takes less time, or it's
going to replace something.


1129
00:54:37.061 --> 00:54:40.092
It reminds me a lot of when
photography was invented.


1130
00:54:40.094 --> 00:54:43.092
Everybody thought that painting
was going to get replaced.


1131
00:54:43.094 --> 00:54:48.291
And what computer animation
does is it has a whole new look,


1132
00:54:48.293 --> 00:54:50.657
but the key word is animation.

1133
00:54:50.659 --> 00:54:53.092
Animation by definition
is making a motion


1134
00:54:53.094 --> 00:54:54.624
picture frame by frame
by frame by frame


1135
00:54:54.626 --> 00:54:56.457
and that doesn't change.

1136
00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:58.425
We labor over
every single frame.


1137
00:54:58.427 --> 00:55:00.658
When we started
on Toy Story, there


1138
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.758
were like four people
in the world who knew


1139
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.590
how to do computer animation.

1140
00:55:03.592 --> 00:55:06.892
And so when we
hired animators, we


1141
00:55:06.894 --> 00:55:10.125
got them largely from hand-drawn
tradition and a number


1142
00:55:10.127 --> 00:55:11.825
of stop motion people.

1143
00:55:11.827 --> 00:55:14.725
And so then we had a
long intensive training


1144
00:55:14.727 --> 00:55:16.892
program where we started.

1145
00:55:16.894 --> 00:55:20.725
And it was not quite as
straightforward as it is now.


1146
00:55:20.727 --> 00:55:23.425
To run the software, you
had to know some command


1147
00:55:23.427 --> 00:55:25.557
line coding and things.

1148
00:55:25.559 --> 00:55:27.624
And so it was a
little complicated


1149
00:55:27.626 --> 00:55:29.125
and it took a
little bit of doing.


1150
00:55:29.127 --> 00:55:31.624
And I remember people
getting really frustrated


1151
00:55:31.626 --> 00:55:32.892
because literally
you would hear people


1152
00:55:32.894 --> 00:55:34.391
going, "If I was
drawing, I could


1153
00:55:34.393 --> 00:55:35.425
do this in a half an hour."

1154
00:55:35.427 --> 00:55:38.191
And it would take days.

1155
00:55:38.193 --> 00:55:40.490
In one sense, it was sudden
but in another sense because I


1156
00:55:40.492 --> 00:55:42.291
was working on other
projects, it was


1157
00:55:42.293 --> 00:55:43.925
this slow thing that happened.

1158
00:55:43.927 --> 00:55:45.658
And the next thing you
know, I just didn't...


1159
00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.224
What just happened?

1160
00:55:47.226 --> 00:55:49.025
It happened so gradually.

1161
00:55:49.027 --> 00:55:50.557
Yeah.

1162
00:55:50.559 --> 00:55:52.992
That was a hard time.

1163
00:55:52.994 --> 00:55:56.391
That was when all of us had
to make a decision that we


1164
00:55:56.393 --> 00:55:58.391
never thought we'd have to.

1165
00:55:58.393 --> 00:56:01.224
I went into Disney thinking
it was going to be a career.


1166
00:56:01.226 --> 00:56:03.524
I was in this thought
process of the nine old men


1167
00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:05.625
did it for 40 years.

1168
00:56:05.627 --> 00:56:09.124
And I thought I'd be
there most of my career,


1169
00:56:09.126 --> 00:56:11.524
and I wouldn't have to really
consider going somewhere else


1170
00:56:11.526 --> 00:56:13.591
or figuring out what
else, especially


1171
00:56:13.593 --> 00:56:16.091
to just leave
animation altogether.


1172
00:56:16.093 --> 00:56:19.658
Some people were able to
make that jump from 2D to 3D,


1173
00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.825
but a few people weren't.

1174
00:56:20.827 --> 00:56:22.892
They didn't have that ability.

1175
00:56:22.894 --> 00:56:26.992
And I know one guy that
became a forklift operator.


1176
00:56:26.994 --> 00:56:29.524
I know somebody else that went
and took jobs in the parks


1177
00:56:29.526 --> 00:56:33.792
and doing retail.

1178
00:56:33.794 --> 00:56:38.224
It's sad to see that because
they're really talented


1179
00:56:38.226 --> 00:56:42.058
great artists that decided to
just let it go because they had


1180
00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.191
this big blow happen
to them and they


1181
00:56:44.193 --> 00:56:46.457
feel that they lost their
livelihood rather than adapt.


1182
00:56:46.459 --> 00:56:48.490
It was sad.

1183
00:56:48.492 --> 00:56:50.925
The change happened at CalArts.

1184
00:56:50.927 --> 00:56:53.758
So when your teacher comes
in and he looks depressed,


1185
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.692
and he goes, "I've been
at Disney for 15 years


1186
00:56:55.694 --> 00:56:58.025
and they just let me go."

1187
00:56:58.027 --> 00:57:02.692
That has a profound effect
on everybody in school.


1188
00:57:02.694 --> 00:57:05.658
And you started seeing
that story happen.


1189
00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.490
And as a student you
go, "I love the medium"


1190
00:57:08.492 --> 00:57:12.692
and I love the craft, but the
people who are teaching me,


1191
00:57:12.694 --> 00:57:15.325
who are amazing, who
have been at Disney


1192
00:57:15.327 --> 00:57:19.591
and worked on all these landmark
movies, they're getting let go.


1193
00:57:19.593 --> 00:57:21.658
"What chance do I have?"

1194
00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.725
So I love you art form,
I love your craft,


1195
00:57:24.727 --> 00:57:26.358
but we can't be together.

1196
00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:29.124
I get a job.

1197
00:57:29.126 --> 00:57:31.457
For a lot of us, I think
what the question became was,


1198
00:57:31.459 --> 00:57:33.925
all right.

1199
00:57:33.927 --> 00:57:36.692
Did I get into animation
because I love to draw


1200
00:57:36.694 --> 00:57:37.725
or did I get into
animation because I


1201
00:57:37.727 --> 00:57:40.490
love to make things move?

1202
00:57:40.492 --> 00:57:44.725
And it almost became that basic
because if you got into it just


1203
00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:48.124
to make things move and
come alive, well then,


1204
00:57:48.126 --> 00:57:51.124
you could adapt probably and
become a computer animator.


1205
00:57:51.126 --> 00:57:53.525
And go down that road, and get
retrained, and go maybe work


1206
00:57:53.527 --> 00:57:55.558
at Pixar or some other studio.

1207
00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.959
But what we did,
this hand-crafted 2D


1208
00:57:58.961 --> 00:58:02.124
animation was now a dinosaur.

1209
00:58:02.126 --> 00:58:05.892
Basically, we were being
told all the skills that we've


1210
00:58:05.894 --> 00:58:10.925
been asking you to develop
and become top tier at,


1211
00:58:10.927 --> 00:58:12.792
we don't need them anymore.

1212
00:58:12.794 --> 00:58:13.660
You need to go away.

1213
00:58:21.794 --> 00:58:23.925
Thankfully, I had
already directed Mulan


1214
00:58:23.927 --> 00:58:27.792
and I had this new
path of, OK, well,


1215
00:58:27.794 --> 00:58:30.692
if I stay away from 2D
animation in general


1216
00:58:30.694 --> 00:58:32.625
but I just direct,
I could direct CG.


1217
00:58:32.627 --> 00:58:34.958
I could direct 2D.

1218
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.758
As a director, it gave me
a lot more flexibility.


1219
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.325
So I just tried to go
the path of creating


1220
00:58:40.327 --> 00:58:42.558
stories, and scripts, and
producing, and directing.


1221
00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.625
Eventually, I moved up North.

1222
00:58:44.627 --> 00:58:49.391
I moved up to Pixar and worked
with the team on Toy Story 2,


1223
00:58:49.393 --> 00:58:54.024
and followed that with Monsters
Inc. But since that time,


1224
00:58:54.026 --> 00:58:57.224
animation has been
totally changed.


1225
00:58:57.226 --> 00:58:59.658
Traditional hand-drawn
animation has been regretfully


1226
00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.358
pushed to the sidelines.

1227
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.358
It's not gone.

1228
00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.825
It's not dead.

1229
00:59:03.827 --> 00:59:06.024
I'm not a pessimist.

1230
00:59:06.026 --> 00:59:08.725
Hand-drawn animation
will always be with us.


1231
00:59:08.727 --> 00:59:11.291
It'll be back one day.

1232
00:59:11.293 --> 00:59:14.991
Audiences will discover it the
same way they discovered CGI,


1233
00:59:14.993 --> 00:59:16.325
and we're going to have
hand-drawn animated films


1234
00:59:16.327 --> 00:59:17.458
again.

1235
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:18.658
You know why?

1236
00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:20.625
Because animators love it.

1237
00:59:20.627 --> 00:59:23.858
Audiences love it.

1238
00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:28.058
We all love hand-drawn
traditional animation.


1239
00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:31.058
WEN: Traditional 2D
animators are continuing


1240
00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:34.224
to find ways to use
their skills to tell


1241
00:59:34.226 --> 00:59:40.058
stories, and even add the human
touch to computer animation.


1242
00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.591
Well, now we know now,
historically looking back,


1243
00:59:42.593 --> 00:59:44.692
they had great storytellers.

1244
00:59:44.694 --> 00:59:46.825
They were all trained
in Disney anyway


1245
00:59:46.827 --> 00:59:48.924
but their stories were great.

1246
00:59:48.926 --> 00:59:50.325
They knew how to make
really great stories.


1247
00:59:50.327 --> 00:59:55.358
It just gives me so much
more respect for that medium


1248
00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.091
because I'm starting with a
CG character, which is already


1249
00:59:59.093 --> 01:00:01.891
more or less on model
and I'm just kind


1250
01:00:01.893 --> 01:00:03.891
of manipulating it from there.

1251
01:00:03.893 --> 01:00:04.958
They're starting with
a blank piece of paper


1252
01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.825
and creating something
that's on model,


1253
01:00:06.827 --> 01:00:08.491
and then turning it,
and then evolving it,


1254
01:00:08.493 --> 01:00:11.091
and then making it expressive.

1255
01:00:11.093 --> 01:00:15.857
And that sort of discipline
just blows my mind.


1256
01:00:15.859 --> 01:00:19.024
And so I find myself
constantly returning


1257
01:00:19.026 --> 01:00:20.924
to drawing because I've
always loved to draw,


1258
01:00:20.926 --> 01:00:23.658
but wanting to go deeper
and wanting to learn


1259
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.525
to keep a character on model.

1260
01:00:25.527 --> 01:00:27.924
And know what are
the rules of appeal?


1261
01:00:27.926 --> 01:00:31.224
I always tell people
Bambi is not a real deer,


1262
01:00:31.226 --> 01:00:34.124
but he's a very believable deer.

1263
01:00:34.126 --> 01:00:38.326
You believe his situation,
you believe his story.


1264
01:00:38.328 --> 01:00:41.991
The idea of believability
versus just duplicating reality,


1265
01:00:41.993 --> 01:00:43.792
and that's a subtle
difference, but there


1266
01:00:43.794 --> 01:00:44.758
is a difference there.

1267
01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.359
We hit a glass ceiling.

1268
01:00:48.361 --> 01:00:55.091
When everything is digital
and everything is dimensional,


1269
01:00:55.093 --> 01:00:57.558
how do you make
something look different?


1270
01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.525
Go back to the earlier style.

1271
01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:04.891
Everything old is new again.

1272
01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:07.525
That's what Lauren McMullen did
with her very ingenious short,


1273
01:01:07.527 --> 01:01:09.625
get a horse.

1274
01:01:09.627 --> 01:01:14.191
That's what the Disney studio
did with the movie Enchanted.


1275
01:01:14.193 --> 01:01:18.091
And they hired a former
Disney animator, James Baxter,


1276
01:01:18.093 --> 01:01:21.258
to animate the opening
segment of that movie.


1277
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.158
And to do so, he hired
other ex-Disney animators


1278
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.625
and a few guys who were
working freelance on the side


1279
01:01:28.627 --> 01:01:31.791
because they were the only ones
who could produce that quality


1280
01:01:31.793 --> 01:01:33.891
of hand-drawn animation.

1281
01:01:33.893 --> 01:01:39.725
These artisans are
now folk heroes


1282
01:01:39.727 --> 01:01:42.725
to a generation
of young animators


1283
01:01:42.727 --> 01:01:45.558
who never learned
that technique,


1284
01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.491
and never acquired those skills.

1285
01:01:48.493 --> 01:01:51.292
And if anything,
I think 2D animation


1286
01:01:51.294 --> 01:01:54.191
has really freed us a lot more.

1287
01:01:54.193 --> 01:01:56.891
It has really pushed
us to the next level.


1288
01:01:56.893 --> 01:01:59.791
We learned this from
Glen Keane on Rapunzel.


1289
01:01:59.793 --> 01:02:03.024
He would sit and
look at the CG work


1290
01:02:03.026 --> 01:02:04.824
being done, and pause
on frames and draw


1291
01:02:04.826 --> 01:02:08.259
over to emphasize poses.

1292
01:02:08.261 --> 01:02:12.458
The elevation for me
at Disney of CG animation


1293
01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.891
took a huge jump
for me in Tangled


1294
01:02:14.893 --> 01:02:17.991
when Glen started
taking CG animators


1295
01:02:17.993 --> 01:02:20.625
and really pushing 2D
principles back into it.


1296
01:02:20.627 --> 01:02:22.958
Break it to make it
look, feel right.


1297
01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.158
Don't worry about it
being technically right.


1298
01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.857
Make it feel right.

1299
01:02:25.859 --> 01:02:28.024
And we picked that
up on Inside Out,


1300
01:02:28.026 --> 01:02:30.024
and we've done it
on every film since.


1301
01:02:30.026 --> 01:02:33.024
I know that Frozen gets
a lot of the accolades


1302
01:02:33.026 --> 01:02:36.525
as far as the rebirth of
Disney feature animation.


1303
01:02:36.527 --> 01:02:40.692
But for me, Tangled was the film
where I was like, oh my God.


1304
01:02:40.694 --> 01:02:43.225
It felt like it really
set the bar higher.


1305
01:02:43.227 --> 01:02:44.558
And we saw that and we're
like, "OK, that's what


1306
01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.724
we're aiming towards now.

1307
01:02:45.726 --> 01:02:47.225
That is just beautiful."

1308
01:02:47.227 --> 01:02:49.625
Well, whether you are
doing it with a computer


1309
01:02:49.627 --> 01:02:53.958
or we're doing it with a
pencil, it doesn't matter.


1310
01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.658
It's about taking what's inside
and showing it to other people.


1311
01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:02.292
It's the gift that we each
have that God's given us


1312
01:03:02.294 --> 01:03:05.359
that we are trying to
translate, to share, to give it


1313
01:03:05.361 --> 01:03:07.991
to somebody else to appreciate.

1314
01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:12.591
So I thought, all right, I
think I know what drawing is.


1315
01:03:12.593 --> 01:03:15.591
When I draw, I watch
the line I make.


1316
01:03:15.593 --> 01:03:17.658
And I started to do that.

1317
01:03:17.659 --> 01:03:20.225
And I thought, I'm just
going to watch what I do.


1318
01:03:20.227 --> 01:03:23.558
I started making a line
of drawing of a character.


1319
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.024
And as I drew, I realized I
wasn't looking at the line.


1320
01:03:28.026 --> 01:03:31.326
You don't look at the
line you're making.


1321
01:03:31.328 --> 01:03:33.757
So I realized I was
always looking to the left


1322
01:03:33.759 --> 01:03:35.924
or to the right of the line.

1323
01:03:35.926 --> 01:03:38.857
And I realized, the
line you're making


1324
01:03:38.859 --> 01:03:42.259
is you're defining the reality
that's between the lines.


1325
01:03:42.261 --> 01:03:44.625
That's what's real.

1326
01:03:44.627 --> 01:03:47.458
And that CG was
doing the same thing.


1327
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.292
It was shading that character
that's between those lines,


1328
01:03:52.294 --> 01:03:55.292
but it was about the
existence of that character.


1329
01:03:55.294 --> 01:03:58.491
And so I realized there's
really no difference.


1330
01:03:58.493 --> 01:04:00.659
We are all living in the skin of
the characters that we create.


1331
01:04:06.127 --> 01:04:09.458
WEN: Now we've come full
circle, with technology


1332
01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:13.426
making it easier than ever to
create hand-drawn animation.


1333
01:04:13.428 --> 01:04:18.791
And this is bringing in a whole
new generation of 2D animators.


1334
01:04:18.793 --> 01:04:22.225
I remember when I was a
freshman, the first teacher I


1335
01:04:22.227 --> 01:04:24.426
ever had, the first
lecture he ever gave us was


1336
01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:27.024
he dimmed the lights ominously.

1337
01:04:27.026 --> 01:04:28.558
And he gathered us
all together and said,


1338
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.891
"2D animation is dying."

1339
01:04:30.893 --> 01:04:33.392
This is a candle
that is dwindling.


1340
01:04:33.394 --> 01:04:36.326
It is in the middle of a
howling storm of commerce,


1341
01:04:36.328 --> 01:04:39.058
and it is up to you to
protect and carry this flame


1342
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.691
to the next generation.

1343
01:04:40.693 --> 01:04:42.192
And if you don't,
animation is dead


1344
01:04:42.194 --> 01:04:44.292
"and you're all going to
be delivering my pizza."


1345
01:04:44.294 --> 01:04:47.159
This is how my education began.

1346
01:04:47.161 --> 01:04:50.159
Now, I in retrospect,
find that metaphor


1347
01:04:50.161 --> 01:04:52.392
to be a bit hyperbolic.

1348
01:04:52.394 --> 01:04:55.958
My personal perspective is
that you can't kill art.


1349
01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.458
You can't kill an art form.

1350
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:03.791
An art form grows and evolves
with the culture it's in.


1351
01:05:03.793 --> 01:05:09.891
So even though Disney,
hand-drawn, feature length


1352
01:05:09.893 --> 01:05:15.159
films, that specific world
is currently non-existent,


1353
01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:19.125
2D animation is not
just Disney hand-drawn


1354
01:05:19.127 --> 01:05:20.590
feature length films.

1355
01:05:20.592 --> 01:05:21.958
I think there's
an irony once again


1356
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:25.491
because I think
the thing that sent


1357
01:05:25.493 --> 01:05:27.590
animation away is technology.

1358
01:05:27.592 --> 01:05:29.491
The advancement of
technology and the ability


1359
01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:31.024
to do these CG animated films.

1360
01:05:31.026 --> 01:05:32.491
But I think the
thing that's going


1361
01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:35.125
to bring it back is technology.

1362
01:05:35.127 --> 01:05:37.757
Technology advancing
for us to do the ways


1363
01:05:37.759 --> 01:05:40.092
that we distribute content.

1364
01:05:40.094 --> 01:05:44.192
And plus, the ways to create 2D
animated films, the software,


1365
01:05:44.194 --> 01:05:47.225
whether you do it digitally or
if you want to do it on paper.


1366
01:05:47.227 --> 01:05:50.125
It's still shooting it.

1367
01:05:50.127 --> 01:05:55.192
There's ways of creating
it quicker and cheaper.


1368
01:05:55.194 --> 01:05:57.259
So some of the things
that we may have been


1369
01:05:57.261 --> 01:05:59.359
prohibitive in the past from
a cost standpoint really


1370
01:05:59.361 --> 01:06:00.958
don't exist anymore.

1371
01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.958
The African saying,
"They buried us


1372
01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.958
but they didn't
know we were seeds."


1373
01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.192
That's what happened
to 2D animation.


1374
01:06:09.194 --> 01:06:12.426
I think everybody
thought it was done


1375
01:06:12.428 --> 01:06:15.791
and it kept growing in
different parts of the world,


1376
01:06:15.793 --> 01:06:17.992
especially in Europe and Japan.

1377
01:06:17.994 --> 01:06:19.924
It kept growing and
it kept growing.


1378
01:06:19.926 --> 01:06:23.524
And the whole generation of
people who grew up with it


1379
01:06:23.526 --> 01:06:29.092
and loved it willed it back and
it slowly started rising again.


1380
01:06:29.094 --> 01:06:32.392
And now, Netflix is spending
real money on a 2D feature


1381
01:06:32.394 --> 01:06:34.757
with Sergio Pablos.

1382
01:06:34.759 --> 01:06:38.992
Who would have thought
a Spaniard from CalArts


1383
01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:42.757
would potentially save feature
animation with his studio?


1384
01:06:42.759 --> 01:06:46.359
When we had an attempt
at reviving 2D animation,


1385
01:06:46.361 --> 01:06:48.959
we just kept looking back.

1386
01:06:48.961 --> 01:06:52.392
We just kept asking audiences,
"Have you been missing these?"


1387
01:06:52.394 --> 01:06:55.392
And audiences said, "We're
all good on princesses


1388
01:06:55.394 --> 01:06:56.259
and singing animals. Thank you.

1389
01:06:56.261 --> 01:06:57.524
We're fine.

1390
01:06:57.526 --> 01:06:59.724
So we don't need that anymore."

1391
01:06:59.726 --> 01:07:01.691
So instead of saying, "What
else can we give them?"


1392
01:07:01.693 --> 01:07:03.657
Then they just said,
"Oh, I guess they want 3D


1393
01:07:03.659 --> 01:07:06.025
and that's what we... ".

1394
01:07:06.027 --> 01:07:12.192
So we never tried anything else
and I thought someone should.


1395
01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:17.557
And it was many people
resentful at Disney


1396
01:07:17.559 --> 01:07:19.590
because we all felt if someone
should, it should be them.


1397
01:07:19.592 --> 01:07:21.292
They made the medium
what it is today.


1398
01:07:21.294 --> 01:07:23.925
So they should be doing
something about it.


1399
01:07:23.927 --> 01:07:27.691
And then one day I just
looked at myself in the mirror


1400
01:07:27.693 --> 01:07:31.259
and I realized I'm one
of the few people who


1401
01:07:31.261 --> 01:07:34.425
got to work in 2D
animation professionally


1402
01:07:34.427 --> 01:07:37.025
and I had my own studio.

1403
01:07:37.027 --> 01:07:39.425
So how am I any less to blame
than Disney for not doing


1404
01:07:39.427 --> 01:07:41.657
something about it, right?

1405
01:07:41.659 --> 01:07:46.326
So I said, "Well, at least
let's give it a try."


1406
01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:51.959
One of the things that

1407
01:07:51.961 --> 01:07:57.125
as the filmmaking advanced, and
you've got real dynamic live


1408
01:07:57.127 --> 01:07:59.925
action filmmakers, those ideas
weren't necessarily translated


1409
01:07:59.927 --> 01:08:02.159
in the hand-drawn medium.

1410
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:03.959
But now, with the
help of technology,


1411
01:08:03.961 --> 01:08:06.724
now we can get more immersive
in our storytelling.


1412
01:08:06.726 --> 01:08:09.992
Klaus is pretty successful
at that, I think.


1413
01:08:09.994 --> 01:08:14.557
Adding elements that really sort
of sweeten the palate when you


1414
01:08:14.559 --> 01:08:16.959
can actually really play
space, and dimension,


1415
01:08:16.961 --> 01:08:19.858
and add atmosphere,
and shadow techniques,


1416
01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.892
and shading and stuff like
that, that actually gives


1417
01:08:21.894 --> 01:08:24.326
2D characters a 3D dimension.

1418
01:08:24.328 --> 01:08:26.490
It had a magical feel to it.

1419
01:08:26.492 --> 01:08:29.025
It was really fun to look at.

1420
01:08:29.027 --> 01:08:34.326
So however we get there, it's
just the organic feeling when


1421
01:08:34.328 --> 01:08:39.225
you animate a scene and
you see just I don't want


1422
01:08:39.227 --> 01:08:40.925
to say imperfections,
but there are


1423
01:08:40.927 --> 01:08:43.259
shifts and changes of realness.

1424
01:08:43.261 --> 01:08:46.959
You look at any movie,
beautiful 2D movie,


1425
01:08:46.961 --> 01:08:51.824
it has a spark in it that's
just a little different.


1426
01:08:51.826 --> 01:08:55.590
We did this two-minute test
proof of concept where we


1427
01:08:55.592 --> 01:08:57.892
basically was meant
to convince investors


1428
01:08:57.894 --> 01:09:00.025
to put money into the film.

1429
01:09:00.027 --> 01:09:01.657
The great thing about
that was because it


1430
01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:03.358
looked like it had
volumetric lighting,


1431
01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.125
people assumed it was CGI.

1432
01:09:05.127 --> 01:09:06.490
And I never pitched
it as a 2D film.


1433
01:09:06.492 --> 01:09:08.724
I just said this is a film.

1434
01:09:08.726 --> 01:09:11.159
We made that
conversation go away.


1435
01:09:11.161 --> 01:09:15.192
All the rejection
just disappeared.


1436
01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:18.925
What was surprising as we
were putting the film together


1437
01:09:18.927 --> 01:09:21.691
and hiring talent,
I started calling


1438
01:09:21.693 --> 01:09:24.557
of course, all the old guard.

1439
01:09:24.559 --> 01:09:26.858
Get out of retirement.

1440
01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.259
Whatever you're
doing, we need you.


1441
01:09:29.261 --> 01:09:32.025
Some did, some of
course, had moved on.


1442
01:09:32.027 --> 01:09:34.825
And there was a big
question mark about,


1443
01:09:34.827 --> 01:09:36.691
can we actually get enough
people to be able to animate


1444
01:09:36.693 --> 01:09:39.757
at this level on a film today?

1445
01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:43.992
And that's when the new
generation started coming up.


1446
01:09:43.994 --> 01:09:47.425
Kids right out of school, maybe
they only work in one film.


1447
01:09:47.427 --> 01:09:50.192
And they had seen
that piece which


1448
01:09:50.194 --> 01:09:51.557
was not meant for
recruiting, but it


1449
01:09:51.559 --> 01:09:53.959
was a best recruitment tool.

1450
01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:57.624
People would say,
"I will relocate.


1451
01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.457
I will move my family
to work on that."


1452
01:09:59.459 --> 01:10:00.127
And they did.

1453
01:10:03.194 --> 01:10:03.827
Hello.

1454
01:10:09.592 --> 01:10:11.391
Yeah.

1455
01:10:11.393 --> 01:10:16.092
It's going to take nothing
short of a miracle.


1456
01:10:16.094 --> 01:10:19.792
Just looking at the crew of
Klaus is really interesting.


1457
01:10:19.794 --> 01:10:24.192
Apart from a couple
of outliers, lunatics


1458
01:10:24.194 --> 01:10:28.159
like Matt Williams and Andrew
Chesworth who are in their 30s.


1459
01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:32.291
It's basically a crew of you're
under 26 or you're over 50.


1460
01:10:32.293 --> 01:10:35.557
And there's this big
gap in the middle where


1461
01:10:35.559 --> 01:10:37.524
everyone went to go do CG.

1462
01:10:37.526 --> 01:10:39.125
But there's all
these kids which are


1463
01:10:39.127 --> 01:10:40.992
under like 26 or
something who are


1464
01:10:40.994 --> 01:10:43.992
just insane about this stuff.

1465
01:10:43.994 --> 01:10:48.925
And like me, like many of us,
they got hooked on this drug


1466
01:10:48.927 --> 01:10:52.092
and it's a powerful drug,
hand-drawn animation.


1467
01:10:52.094 --> 01:10:54.825
And animators out there,
hand-drawn animators that are


1468
01:10:54.827 --> 01:10:57.092
being born now watching that
movie for the first time


1469
01:10:57.094 --> 01:10:58.725
and wanting to jump into
this medium and say,


1470
01:10:58.727 --> 01:11:01.224
"Hey, I saw 101 Dalmatians.

1471
01:11:01.226 --> 01:11:02.925
Wow, blow my mind."

1472
01:11:02.927 --> 01:11:05.059
I think that there's artists
out there that, "Yeah",


1473
01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:07.457
3D is really great, but
this hand-drawn stuff, this


1474
01:11:07.459 --> 01:11:09.425
is not that.

1475
01:11:09.427 --> 01:11:11.358
This is not the 3D stuff.

1476
01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.858
Those performances
are really cool


1477
01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:14.524
"and I want to
learn this medium."


1478
01:11:14.526 --> 01:11:18.159
I grew up to work on
Masters of the Universe.


1479
01:11:18.161 --> 01:11:22.490
So all that time I spent as a
kid watching Masters Universe,


1480
01:11:22.492 --> 01:11:23.825
and not always
watching it as a fan.


1481
01:11:23.827 --> 01:11:26.692
Sometimes hate watching
and be like, Orko.


1482
01:11:26.694 --> 01:11:28.992
All the time I spent
watching it and all


1483
01:11:28.994 --> 01:11:30.524
the time my parents
were like, "Why don't


1484
01:11:30.526 --> 01:11:31.657
you go out and do something?

1485
01:11:31.659 --> 01:11:32.792
Stop watching these cartoons.

1486
01:11:32.794 --> 01:11:34.624
This is a waste of your time."

1487
01:11:34.626 --> 01:11:35.224
I love my parents to death.

1488
01:11:35.226 --> 01:11:38.158
They were wrong.

1489
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.391
Thank God I put in the work when
I did because when I grew up,


1490
01:11:40.393 --> 01:11:43.725
somebody was like, "Would you
like to take over Eternia?"


1491
01:11:43.727 --> 01:11:45.358
Would you like to put words
in the mouth of Cringer?


1492
01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.391
I was like, "Words and more.

1493
01:11:46.393 --> 01:11:47.825
Let me at it."

1494
01:11:47.827 --> 01:11:50.725
And so that came
from a childhood


1495
01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:53.125
growing up with cartoons.

1496
01:11:53.127 --> 01:11:55.925
I feel like that love of the
medium, that acknowledgment


1497
01:11:55.927 --> 01:11:59.992
of a profound impact it
had on a whole generation


1498
01:11:59.994 --> 01:12:01.758
of not only artists,
but kids who


1499
01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.692
grew up loving these movies.

1500
01:12:04.694 --> 01:12:06.490
These movies that
changed people's lives.


1501
01:12:06.492 --> 01:12:08.858
They changed their dreams.

1502
01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:12.692
They literally formed their
view of the world, is now,


1503
01:12:12.694 --> 01:12:15.025
you're seeing the seeds grow.

1504
01:12:15.027 --> 01:12:15.792
And now, you're seeing all
these different trees all over


1505
01:12:15.794 --> 01:12:19.158
the world blossoming with that.

1506
01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.925
And I don't even think people
who made those movies back then


1507
01:12:21.927 --> 01:12:26.925
had any idea how endless
these movies were going to be,


1508
01:12:26.927 --> 01:12:30.258
how profound the impact was
going to be on these things.


1509
01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:32.758
It's an amazing time where we're
now looking at these things


1510
01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.457
in a whole different way.

1511
01:12:35.459 --> 01:12:40.025
Every university
in a major city now


1512
01:12:40.027 --> 01:12:43.490
has a course on how to do
animation, which is insane.


1513
01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.692
When I was getting
into animation,


1514
01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:47.959
there was one in the UK
where you could go learn


1515
01:12:47.961 --> 01:12:49.591
to do animation and a
couple in the United.


1516
01:12:49.593 --> 01:12:50.858
States that was
just like, "That's


1517
01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.792
where you go to do animation."

1518
01:12:52.794 --> 01:12:54.524
Every university now
has some little thing


1519
01:12:54.526 --> 01:12:55.725
where you go do animation.

1520
01:12:55.727 --> 01:12:59.091
So many of my
students are coming in


1521
01:12:59.093 --> 01:13:00.425
because they grew up with Lion
King, Beauty and the Beast,


1522
01:13:00.427 --> 01:13:01.992
and Aladdin.

1523
01:13:01.994 --> 01:13:03.490
All these films
that I worked on.


1524
01:13:03.492 --> 01:13:05.725
They are adamant
about wanting to be


1525
01:13:05.727 --> 01:13:08.325
2D animators just like I was.

1526
01:13:08.327 --> 01:13:10.792
And look at the stuff that's
coming out of Europe and Japan,


1527
01:13:10.794 --> 01:13:13.625
and there's still the
great stuff over there.


1528
01:13:13.627 --> 01:13:16.191
But I feel like the
mainstream high end


1529
01:13:16.193 --> 01:13:22.591
you broad appeal feature
animation in traditional needs


1530
01:13:22.593 --> 01:13:23.892
to come back.

1531
01:13:23.894 --> 01:13:25.625
It doesn't need to take over.

1532
01:13:25.627 --> 01:13:26.892
That's not what I'm saying.

1533
01:13:26.894 --> 01:13:30.058
It just needs to have a place.

1534
01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:34.825
It's a way of registering
something inside of me


1535
01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:38.457
that I almost
can't even control.


1536
01:13:38.459 --> 01:13:42.625
That it comes out in the way
I put the line on the paper.


1537
01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:45.692
I think of it as a
seismograph of your soul


1538
01:13:45.694 --> 01:13:48.892
is this energy
that you draw with.


1539
01:13:48.894 --> 01:13:51.325
And I feel like
there is something


1540
01:13:51.327 --> 01:13:53.758
that we are communicating
actually in the way


1541
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.124
you put the line down.

1542
01:13:56.126 --> 01:13:59.858
My son Max, as we were
working on Duet at one


1543
01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:03.224
point, which was hand drawn.

1544
01:14:03.226 --> 01:14:07.792
He said, "Dad, do you
realize every line you make


1545
01:14:07.794 --> 01:14:11.158
is the first time
and the last time


1546
01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.992
that that stroke will ever be
made in the history of time.


1547
01:14:13.994 --> 01:14:17.825
There will never be another
line like that line."


1548
01:14:17.827 --> 01:14:20.825
And we learned that because
as we would do that,


1549
01:14:20.827 --> 01:14:24.658
we took a look at a line
and it was like a field


1550
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.158
of graphite Stardust.

1551
01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:30.291
That it was different
every stroke.


1552
01:14:30.293 --> 01:14:35.224
It was a revelation to me of the
importance of line and energy,


1553
01:14:35.226 --> 01:14:41.224
and that little film allowed
me to communicate how I felt


1554
01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:46.224
about little boy, a little girl,
growing up through the drawing.


1555
01:14:46.226 --> 01:14:50.725
And then Kobe saw that and
when he asked me to animate


1556
01:14:50.727 --> 01:14:54.258
his letter to basketball,
Dear Basketball,


1557
01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:56.525
he said, "But it's
got to be hand-drawn.


1558
01:14:56.527 --> 01:14:57.792
There's this soul to it.

1559
01:14:57.794 --> 01:15:00.258
There's this touch."

1560
01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:03.792
And all the things that I
felt, he was saying back to me.


1561
01:15:03.794 --> 01:15:05.391
And was like, "Yeah,
we got to do this."


1562
01:15:05.393 --> 01:15:09.224
We won an Academy Award in

1563
01:15:09.226 --> 01:15:11.758
I'll never forget.

1564
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.658
PRESENTER: And the Oscar
goes to Dear Basketball,


1565
01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.794
Glen Keane and Kobe.

1566
01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.758
Whatever form
your dream may take,


1567
01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.925
it's through passion
and perseverance


1568
01:15:26.927 --> 01:15:32.224
that the impossible is possible.

1569
01:15:32.226 --> 01:15:37.224
WEN: So what lies ahead in
the future for animation?


1570
01:15:37.226 --> 01:15:39.658
We are in a unique
moment right now,


1571
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.024
I think, in the
history of animation.


1572
01:15:42.026 --> 01:15:46.558
There is a enormous boom
happening right now and coming.


1573
01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.558
I would say that there has
literally never been a better


1574
01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.692
time in the history of the
world to pitch an animated TV


1575
01:15:51.694 --> 01:15:53.991
show than right now.

1576
01:15:53.993 --> 01:15:56.024
What's interesting to me
about television animation


1577
01:15:56.026 --> 01:15:58.558
is it's the one place
now where 2D animation is


1578
01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:01.091
still very much alive and well.

1579
01:16:01.093 --> 01:16:03.792
And not only alive and
well, but preferred.


1580
01:16:03.794 --> 01:16:06.258
The hunger for
animation is red hot


1581
01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:09.191
and the competition
among studios is red hot.


1582
01:16:09.193 --> 01:16:11.224
And whenever there's a lot
of studios in competition,


1583
01:16:11.226 --> 01:16:13.024
that's an exciting
time for creators.


1584
01:16:13.026 --> 01:16:14.158
It's an exciting
time for artists


1585
01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.858
because it means
there's a lot of work


1586
01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.891
and it means there's
enormous opportunity.


1587
01:16:18.893 --> 01:16:22.224
An amazing new
world of 2D animation


1588
01:16:22.226 --> 01:16:25.792
is happening right
now and I haven't


1589
01:16:25.794 --> 01:16:26.991
been busier in my
whole life I think,


1590
01:16:26.993 --> 01:16:30.191
than I am right now at age 53.

1591
01:16:30.193 --> 01:16:33.024
I'm really excited about
the future of animation


1592
01:16:33.026 --> 01:16:37.591
as it becomes easier to
find more and more diverse


1593
01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.392
influences.

1594
01:16:40.394 --> 01:16:43.024
I feel like I was part of the
first generation to grow up


1595
01:16:43.026 --> 01:16:47.991
with anime really easily
accessible, and web comics


1596
01:16:47.993 --> 01:16:50.191
really accessible, which
definitely influenced


1597
01:16:50.193 --> 01:16:52.825
me and my contemporaries.

1598
01:16:52.827 --> 01:16:55.258
And I think the next
generation has even


1599
01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.825
more tools at their disposal.

1600
01:16:57.827 --> 01:17:00.558
There's enough small
commercial houses.


1601
01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.658
There's enough video
games that are embracing


1602
01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:04.825
2D animation like
Cuphead and all


1603
01:17:04.827 --> 01:17:07.792
these amazing indie
game studios that


1604
01:17:07.794 --> 01:17:09.191
said, "Is 2D animation dead?

1605
01:17:09.193 --> 01:17:10.658
We don't care. We love it.

1606
01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:12.392
We're going to bring it back."

1607
01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:14.792
I think accessibility is
going to be the big changing


1608
01:17:14.794 --> 01:17:16.857
factor in animation.

1609
01:17:16.859 --> 01:17:17.625
I mean, I think back
to when I was a kid,


1610
01:17:17.627 --> 01:17:20.991
there was no information at all.

1611
01:17:20.993 --> 01:17:23.191
I mean, you could go to
the library and maybe find,


1612
01:17:23.193 --> 01:17:25.958
maybe find a book on
animation but that was it.


1613
01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.558
And everything else
was just a mystery.


1614
01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.924
And then here comes
YouTube which suddenly,


1615
01:17:30.926 --> 01:17:31.792
it's a little more accessible.

1616
01:17:31.794 --> 01:17:33.891
And now there are apps.

1617
01:17:33.893 --> 01:17:35.891
It will always have

1618
01:17:35.893 --> 01:17:39.024
As long as there's a child out
there who watches a cartoon,


1619
01:17:39.026 --> 01:17:40.958
who takes a pencil and a
pen to a piece of paper,


1620
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.124
2D animation will always exist.

1621
01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:47.326
It's now in the domain
of the common man.


1622
01:17:47.328 --> 01:17:49.392
When Disney was popularizing it
throughout the '40s and '50s,


1623
01:17:49.394 --> 01:17:51.158
only gods could do that.

1624
01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.392
Now, you got a kid at
home doing it on TikTok.


1625
01:17:54.394 --> 01:17:56.891
You got a kid at home doing
it on Instagram and stuff.


1626
01:17:56.893 --> 01:17:59.558
So 2D animation will
be with us forever.


1627
01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:04.058
But it really comes down to
is that the level of artistry


1628
01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:06.658
was so high that these guys
did under the leadership


1629
01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.359
of Walt Disney.

1630
01:18:09.361 --> 01:18:10.924
That when you do something
so good, it's for the ages


1631
01:18:10.926 --> 01:18:13.824
and it will keep
inspiring people to do


1632
01:18:13.826 --> 01:18:15.857
great things in the future.

1633
01:18:15.859 --> 01:18:18.591
The last few years,
we've seen hybrids


1634
01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:22.857
of documentary and animation.

1635
01:18:22.859 --> 01:18:26.491
Just last year, one
film was nominated


1636
01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:31.658
in three separate categories,
Best Animated Feature, Best.


1637
01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.426
Documentary, and Best
International Film,


1638
01:18:35.428 --> 01:18:40.326
and that was Flee, which told
a dramatic true life story


1639
01:18:40.328 --> 01:18:42.958
using animation as its medium.

1640
01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.591
Animation, as people say over
and over again, is not a genre.


1641
01:18:46.593 --> 01:18:49.757
It's a medium.

1642
01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:52.924
It's a medium in which you
can tell any kind of story.


1643
01:18:52.926 --> 01:18:55.392
We're all communicating
with pictures.


1644
01:18:55.394 --> 01:19:00.525
And the more you abstract
your art direction,


1645
01:19:00.527 --> 01:19:03.891
you're dealing with drawing,
even if you're still modeling,


1646
01:19:03.893 --> 01:19:08.058
and rigging, and
using virtual puppets,


1647
01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:10.458
the more you abstract
things and they start


1648
01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:12.791
to look less and less real
and more and more caricatured


1649
01:19:12.793 --> 01:19:15.757
and stuff, you are
dealing with all


1650
01:19:15.759 --> 01:19:18.458
of these lessons that have
been learned tried and true


1651
01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:20.292
for the last 100 years.

1652
01:19:20.294 --> 01:19:21.625
Of like, "Oh, this works.

1653
01:19:21.627 --> 01:19:22.126
That doesn't."

1654
01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:29.491
WEN: Whether it is 2D
hand-drawn animation,


1655
01:19:29.493 --> 01:19:33.724
computer-generated animation, or
techniques we have yet to even


1656
01:19:33.726 --> 01:19:37.259
discover, one thing is certain.

1657
01:19:37.261 --> 01:19:43.192
Animation is by nature an
incredibly human art form.


1658
01:19:43.194 --> 01:19:46.491
These are moving images
that come directly


1659
01:19:46.493 --> 01:19:49.991
from the imagination of some
of the most creative artists


1660
01:19:49.993 --> 01:19:53.991
and storytellers the
world has ever seen.


1661
01:19:53.993 --> 01:19:58.259
Animation lets us communicate
and connect with each other


1662
01:19:58.261 --> 01:20:01.359
in a unique way that is
easy to take for granted.


1663
01:20:01.361 --> 01:20:04.625
But to me, it's pure magic.

1664
01:20:04.627 --> 01:20:07.627
[music playing]

1665
01:20:15.093 --> 01:20:17.991
So next time you're
watching an animated film,


1666
01:20:17.993 --> 01:20:21.558
especially if it's hand-drawn,
perhaps you'll take a moment


1667
01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:27.024
to appreciate the heart and soul
that's poured into every frame.


1668
01:20:27.026 --> 01:20:28.091
[music playing] ready
for you, Ming-Na.


1669
01:20:28.093 --> 01:20:28.527
Want to do a take?

1670
01:20:33.294 --> 01:20:33.926
Ready.

1671
01:20:43.093 --> 01:20:50.824
[paper rustling]

1672
01:20:50.826 --> 01:20:52.991
So what are you
doing there, Tom?


1673
01:20:52.993 --> 01:20:54.392
Oh, hey Ming
-Na.

1674
01:20:54.394 --> 01:20:57.058
I'm just animating you jumping.

1675
01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.259
I'm using the squash
and stretch technique


1676
01:20:59.261 --> 01:21:00.691
to give you that jump illusion.

1677
01:21:00.693 --> 01:21:03.259
Interesting.

1678
01:21:03.261 --> 01:21:05.691
Well, that frame right
there isn't very flattering.


1679
01:21:05.693 --> 01:21:06.691
Oh no, Ming
-Na.

1680
01:21:06.693 --> 01:21:08.590
That's just a blur drawing.

1681
01:21:08.592 --> 01:21:10.590
So you only see
it for one frame.


1682
01:21:10.592 --> 01:21:14.125
But when we put all the drawings
together and we speed them up,


1683
01:21:14.127 --> 01:21:15.426
it'll feel like you're
jumping up and down.


1684
01:21:15.428 --> 01:21:16.392
See.

1685
01:21:16.394 --> 01:21:17.525
Ah.

1686
01:21:17.527 --> 01:21:18.292
Now I see.

1687
01:21:18.294 --> 01:21:18.960
That's pretty cool.

1688
01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.359
OK, Ming
-Na.

1689
01:21:23.361 --> 01:21:25.757
Rough animation is done.

1690
01:21:25.759 --> 01:21:28.757
Now it's time for clean
up, but I need you


1691
01:21:28.759 --> 01:21:32.292
to stay really, really still.

1692
01:21:32.294 --> 01:21:35.326
Is... is that pencil sharp?

1693
01:21:35.328 --> 01:21:37.657
No it's not too sharp.

1694
01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:38.924
All right.

1695
01:21:38.926 --> 01:21:40.392
So this is clean up line.

1696
01:21:40.394 --> 01:21:43.024
So you have to stay very still.

1697
01:21:43.026 --> 01:21:46.590
We also call this
the final line.


1698
01:21:46.592 --> 01:21:49.426
And that means
it's the one that's


1699
01:21:49.428 --> 01:21:54.225
going to get colored in so
it's got to be just right.


1700
01:21:54.227 --> 01:21:54.960
Doing the best I can.

1701
01:21:58.294 --> 01:22:02.426
Ooh, loving those lashes.

1702
01:22:02.428 --> 01:22:03.958
OK.

1703
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.024
Almost ready.

1704
01:22:07.026 --> 01:22:08.557
Camera looks good.

1705
01:22:08.559 --> 01:22:09.159
All right.

1706
01:22:09.161 --> 01:22:10.458
Say cheese.

1707
01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:12.192
Oh wait, wait, don't say cheese.

1708
01:22:12.194 --> 01:22:13.127
No, no, just stay still.

1709
01:22:17.428 --> 01:22:18.924
There's a lot of being still
in the animation process,


1710
01:22:18.926 --> 01:22:21.292
isn't there?

1711
01:22:21.294 --> 01:22:23.359
I guess this is why they
call it a still shot, ha.


1712
01:22:23.361 --> 01:22:25.192
Ming
-Na, don't move.

1713
01:22:25.194 --> 01:22:26.924
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1714
01:22:26.926 --> 01:22:28.824
All right.

1715
01:22:28.826 --> 01:22:32.824
Now, I'm uploading
your image and there.


1716
01:22:32.826 --> 01:22:34.059
Perfect.

1717
01:22:34.061 --> 01:22:35.524
All right.

1718
01:22:35.526 --> 01:22:36.958
Look.

1719
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:39.524
Looking pretty good,
ready for color.


1720
01:22:39.526 --> 01:22:41.027
Oh, I was made for the screen.

1721
01:22:51.361 --> 01:22:52.924
Hey.

1722
01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:54.724
Whoopsies.

1723
01:22:54.726 --> 01:22:57.092
Didn't your mother teach
you to color in the lines?


1724
01:22:57.094 --> 01:22:57.759
I thought you were
a pro at this.


1725
01:23:01.161 --> 01:23:03.724
Hey, I'm just messing
with you, Tom.


1726
01:23:03.726 --> 01:23:05.657
OK, OK, for real.

1727
01:23:05.659 --> 01:23:06.490
I'll stay still.

1728
01:23:06.492 --> 01:23:08.857
Yeah, that would help.

1729
01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:10.092
- Come on.
- Last time.


1730
01:23:10.094 --> 01:23:10.857
That was it.

1731
01:23:10.859 --> 01:23:11.992
Promise.

1732
01:23:11.994 --> 01:23:12.626
Yeah.

1733
01:23:20.826 --> 01:23:22.092
Wow.

1734
01:23:22.094 --> 01:23:23.724
What a great film.

1735
01:23:23.726 --> 01:23:25.426
Thanks so much for letting
me be a part of it, Tom.


1736
01:23:25.428 --> 01:23:26.292
Oh no.

1737
01:23:26.294 --> 01:23:28.657
Thank you, Ming
-Na.

1738
01:23:28.659 --> 01:23:30.524
We were so happy to have
you on this journey with us.


1739
01:23:30.526 --> 01:23:33.025
Me too.

1740
01:23:33.027 --> 01:23:33.526
Hey, nice one.

1741
01:23:38.859 --> 01:23:41.526
By the way, I loved
you in Mandalorian.
