00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.576
The World Health
Organization has confirmed


3
00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:26.446
that the new virus strain
discovered in the UK


4
00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:29.349
has mutated to
airborne transmission.


5
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:31.317
The report warns that
the infectious...


6
00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:42.195
This new
strain is far more lethal


7
00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:44.297
than the last variant
and could potentially


8
00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.215
kill into the
millions by next July.


9
00:00:46.257 --> 00:00:48.134
A UK airborne
strain has been discovered


10
00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:50.737
in Moscow with four
infection cases,


11
00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:53.073
two of which dead within hours

12
00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.116
of contracting the
mutated variant.


13
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.716
Believe
that there are currently


14
00:01:03.758 --> 00:01:07.654
2.5 billion confirmed cases
of infected individuals,


15
00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:09.823
and the death toll has
reached 1.6 billion.


16
00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:11.224
They'll
tell you that efforts


17
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.326
to develop vaccines and
an effective treatment


18
00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:14.861
are not moving fast
enough to keep up


19
00:01:14.903 --> 00:01:16.563
with the ever mutating virus

20
00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:18.798
He added that the last
strain is the deadliest


21
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.134
and may inevitably
kill billions more


22
00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:22.402
- over the next few months.
- The new strain


23
00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:24.204
doesn't appear to be affecting

24
00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:26.339
a large portion of global youth.

25
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:27.640
We are
working fast to analyze


26
00:01:27.682 --> 00:01:30.477
their biological
and genetic coding


27
00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:33.313
to discover the secret of
their resistance to the Virus.


28
00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:35.548
These children
and teens may represent


29
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.651
the last vestige of
the human population.


30
00:01:38.693 --> 00:01:40.386
All major
cities have gone barren


31
00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:42.422
with masses of
citizens taking refuge


32
00:01:42.464 --> 00:01:44.190
in underground bunkers.

33
00:01:44.232 --> 00:01:45.525
With a limited food supply

34
00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:48.234
their prospects for
long-term survival is bleak.


35
00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:58.138
5.3 Billion
lives gone by today's count.


36
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.673
Millions of children,
teens worldwide


37
00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:02.775
have abated
infection and are now


38
00:02:02.817 --> 00:02:05.145
left to their own
means of survival.


39
00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.186
The final chapter
of humanity has come


40
00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:16.563
to its fated conclusion
with a consolation of hope,


41
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.501
that the young will
inherit the earth.


42
00:22:50.164 --> 00:22:52.824
We can't leave for a while.

43
00:22:52.866 --> 00:22:53.865
How long?

44
00:22:54.968 --> 00:22:57.529
Two, maybe three hours.

45
00:24:52.553 --> 00:24:57.589
Hey, today I came this
close to losing my world.


46
00:24:58.692 --> 00:24:59.991
You took me there.

47
00:25:00.961 --> 00:25:04.256
Number one rule, no loud noises.

48
00:25:04.298 --> 00:25:06.825
I've seen them pick up
sounds from a mile away.


49
00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:09.935
That is how they track
us. Do you understand?


50
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.800
The city's been clean
for more than two weeks.


51
00:25:15.842 --> 00:25:18.610
You show up and suddenly
they're all over the place.


52
00:25:19.613 --> 00:25:21.840
They're hunting you.

53
00:25:21.882 --> 00:25:24.776
They don't know I'm
here. I can't have that.


54
00:25:24.818 --> 00:25:26.611
You can stay here the night.

55
00:25:26.653 --> 00:25:27.852
Then you have to leave.

56
00:25:28.922 --> 00:25:30.882
Tomorrow, scrounge up
some food and supplies,


57
00:25:30.924 --> 00:25:31.990
help you on your way

58
00:25:38.065 --> 00:25:38.997
Hungry?

59
00:25:40.634 --> 00:25:41.933
I'll cook us up some food.

60
00:26:20.107 --> 00:26:21.106
This is amazing.

61
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:24.976
And it's safe?

62
00:26:25.946 --> 00:26:26.871
Yep.

63
00:26:26.913 --> 00:26:29.307
Dried pasta the last few years.

64
00:26:29.349 --> 00:26:30.715
Same with the beans.

65
00:26:31.785 --> 00:26:33.718
Or the radishes in
the neighbor's yard.


66
00:26:37.124 --> 00:26:38.690
Oh my gosh. So good.

67
00:26:42.195 --> 00:26:43.928
What's the last thing you ate?

68
00:26:44.998 --> 00:26:48.166
Bad peaches. I threw up.

69
00:26:49.336 --> 00:26:50.862
Okay.

70
00:26:50.904 --> 00:26:53.204
Before that, canned cat food.

71
00:26:54.741 --> 00:26:56.267
You shouldn't do that.

72
00:26:56.309 --> 00:26:58.777
Canned pet food goes
bad after a few years.


73
00:26:59.713 --> 00:27:01.172
- I didn't know that.
- Know it.


74
00:27:01.214 --> 00:27:03.748
It's the only way you're
gonna survive in this world.


75
00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:07.812
And stay away from any
kind of animal meat,


76
00:27:07.854 --> 00:27:09.914
seafood, fresh fish.

77
00:27:09.956 --> 00:27:10.989
It's all infected.

78
00:27:12.092 --> 00:27:13.718
Your immune system
gets slaughtered.


79
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.027
You get diseased
and then you die.


80
00:27:17.698 --> 00:27:20.325
That's why there's so many
sick stragglers in this town.


81
00:27:20.367 --> 00:27:21.866
Learned that the hard way.

82
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:25.236
What happened?

83
00:27:36.183 --> 00:27:38.016
I lost someone
very close to me.


84
00:27:55.736 --> 00:27:57.328
This one will tell you
all the safe plants to eat


85
00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:00.071
in the wild and the
ones that are poisonous.


86
00:28:08.381 --> 00:28:11.209
This one has all the survival
tricks you need to know.


87
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:14.846
How to find water,
treat wounds, illness,


88
00:28:14.888 --> 00:28:17.922
how not to die of
hypothermia, stuff like that.


89
00:28:24.765 --> 00:28:26.364
You're really
making me go away.


90
00:28:27.934 --> 00:28:28.867
Yep.

91
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.437
Who are the
men in the white suits?


92
00:28:39.479 --> 00:28:41.112
I call them stalkers.

93
00:28:42.382 --> 00:28:44.816
They work for the
government or military.


94
00:28:46.253 --> 00:28:48.780
In any end of the
world scenario,


95
00:28:48.822 --> 00:28:51.422
the president and all the
elites go underground.


96
00:28:52.392 --> 00:28:54.052
Doomsday bunkers,

97
00:28:54.094 --> 00:28:57.756
equipped with enough
food, power and supplies


98
00:28:57.798 --> 00:28:59.330
to last them a few years.

99
00:29:02.803 --> 00:29:04.369
What do they want with me?

100
00:29:10.911 --> 00:29:14.546
What they don't
have. Immunity.


101
00:29:16.249 --> 00:29:18.149
We carry their vaccine.

102
00:29:19.886 --> 00:29:24.956
With all their money,
technology, power,


103
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.259
they're stuck in a prison.

104
00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:34.532
No trees, no sun, no stars.

105
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:38.870
Makes you think
how lucky we are.


106
00:29:40.507 --> 00:29:42.140
This planet is ours.

107
00:29:43.343 --> 00:29:44.242
We're free.

108
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.247
What'll happen
if they catch me?


109
00:29:51.484 --> 00:29:53.318
Good chance
you'll be a lab rat.


110
00:29:55.522 --> 00:29:56.554
Or dissected.

111
00:29:58.258 --> 00:30:00.124
Forced to be a human incubator.

112
00:30:02.162 --> 00:30:05.463
Either way, your life is over.

113
00:30:10.537 --> 00:30:11.870
I'm scared.

114
00:30:13.139 --> 00:30:14.606
That's what makes you weak.

115
00:30:16.176 --> 00:30:17.569
That's why they'll get you.

116
00:30:22.515 --> 00:30:23.448
Goodnight.

117
00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.349
Goodnight.

118
00:30:48.108 --> 00:30:51.870
Padded foam, glue, and
Velcro to attach them.


119
00:30:51.912 --> 00:30:53.678
This is your assignment
while I'm gone.


120
00:30:55.448 --> 00:30:58.616
And if I by chance
stalkers come here for you,


121
00:31:00.453 --> 00:31:02.981
this rocket is armed
with an explosive.


122
00:31:03.023 --> 00:31:05.884
Make sure the two clips
are attached to the wires.


123
00:31:05.926 --> 00:31:09.527
To launch it, hold this button
down, then press this one.


124
00:31:10.597 --> 00:31:12.530
The sound will let me
know not to return.


125
00:31:13.533 --> 00:31:15.099
I better not hear this.

126
00:31:16.536 --> 00:31:20.038
Hey, I don't know your name.

127
00:31:21.007 --> 00:31:22.106
Doesn't matter.

128
00:34:56.723 --> 00:34:58.583
Got you a little canned food.

129
00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:02.420
Can opener, matches,
compass, first aid.


130
00:35:02.462 --> 00:35:03.361
You'll be fine.

131
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:11.769
Let's see.

132
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:16.374
Good job.

133
00:35:21.915 --> 00:35:23.915
Got you a gun. Bullets.

134
00:35:26.319 --> 00:35:29.147
Might need this if a
stalker comes at you.


135
00:35:29.189 --> 00:35:32.350
Safety catch is here. Click
it down if you need to shoot.


136
00:35:32.392 --> 00:35:35.226
Hold it. Hold it.

137
00:35:37.297 --> 00:35:38.896
You may have to kill to survive.

138
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.365
And one more thing.

139
00:35:41.968 --> 00:35:44.162
Don't trust survivors.

140
00:35:44.204 --> 00:35:45.796
They may act like your friend

141
00:35:45.838 --> 00:35:48.499
until they kill,
cook and eat you.


142
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:51.576
I've seen it happen.

143
00:35:59.352 --> 00:36:00.284
Ready?

144
00:36:02.222 --> 00:36:04.448
Please let me stay with you.

145
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:06.350
It's not personal.

146
00:36:06.392 --> 00:36:09.260
I take no responsibility
for anyone other than myself


147
00:36:12.799 --> 00:36:14.565
And don't waste
your tears on me.


148
00:37:22.635 --> 00:37:25.503
There's a town about 10
miles south from here.


149
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.248
Bear Creek.

150
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:29.000
This road ends a few miles up.

151
00:37:29.042 --> 00:37:30.401
And from there
you'll be off road


152
00:37:30.443 --> 00:37:32.076
and should be safe
from the stalkers.


153
00:37:34.714 --> 00:37:36.374
It's a clear sky.

154
00:37:36.416 --> 00:37:38.049
Moon should give
you enough light.


155
00:37:41.321 --> 00:37:42.046
Good luck.

156
00:40:26.886 --> 00:40:27.952
Goddamn you.

157
00:41:50.703 --> 00:41:53.097
Stalkers are due a
full sweep of the town,


158
00:41:53.139 --> 00:41:55.773
block by block, house by house.

159
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:08.078
Most survivors lack the skills
to avoid getting caught.


160
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.214
They're careless and stupid.

161
00:42:10.256 --> 00:42:13.817
If they haven't been caught
by now, they will be soon.


162
00:42:23.803 --> 00:42:26.096
Then it's game over.

163
00:42:26.138 --> 00:42:28.172
I refuse to let
that happen to me.


164
00:42:29.909 --> 00:42:30.908
I'd rather die.

165
00:42:33.713 --> 00:42:36.240
Since we're at a higher
elevation, it'll be two,


166
00:42:36.282 --> 00:42:39.109
maybe three days
before they reach us.


167
00:42:39.151 --> 00:42:40.818
But we'll be gone before that.

168
00:42:41.887 --> 00:42:43.881
We'll head north,
hide for a while,


169
00:42:43.923 --> 00:42:45.022
then come back.

170
00:42:45.925 --> 00:42:47.151
Tomorrow, I'll go shopping.

171
00:42:47.193 --> 00:42:49.286
Get you geared up,
utility jacket,


172
00:42:49.328 --> 00:42:51.989
survival supplies, weapons.

173
00:42:52.031 --> 00:42:57.034
But remember, you're on probation.
I'm giving you one week.


174
00:42:58.104 --> 00:42:59.863
If you can prove to me
that I'm better with you


175
00:42:59.905 --> 00:43:02.306
than I am without,
you can stick around.


176
00:43:03.376 --> 00:43:06.670
If not, I'm gonna
cut you loose. Okay?


177
00:43:06.712 --> 00:43:07.871
Okay.

178
00:43:07.913 --> 00:43:10.708
But most importantly,
pay attention, Ellie.


179
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.142
If the enemy is in front of you,

180
00:43:12.184 --> 00:43:15.919
don't hesitate even
for one second, kill.


181
00:43:16.789 --> 00:43:18.816
Don't think of them as people.

182
00:43:18.858 --> 00:43:19.857
It's you are them.

183
00:43:21.127 --> 00:43:24.254
Now, if you're gonna be
sleeping in my bed again,


184
00:43:24.296 --> 00:43:25.956
you need to clean up.

185
00:43:25.998 --> 00:43:28.359
You stink.

186
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:30.234
When was the last
time you bathed?


187
00:43:31.103 --> 00:43:32.036
A few days.

188
00:44:24.123 --> 00:44:25.122
Thank you, Quinn.

189
00:44:26.292 --> 00:44:27.224
For what?

190
00:44:28.894 --> 00:44:30.728
Giving me a second chance.

191
00:44:32.498 --> 00:44:33.464
You're welcome.

192
00:44:35.234 --> 00:44:36.333
You're a good artist.

193
00:44:37.737 --> 00:44:39.169
Just thought you should know.

194
00:44:40.005 --> 00:44:40.938
Thanks.

195
00:44:42.274 --> 00:44:43.207
Good night.

196
00:44:46.312 --> 00:44:47.444
Good night.

197
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.212
Don't.

198
00:45:23.949 --> 00:45:24.882
Sorry.

199
00:56:07.492 --> 00:56:08.758
Put her down.

200
00:59:51.783 --> 00:59:52.715
Hey.

201
00:59:53.752 --> 00:59:55.011
Ellie?

202
00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:57.146
Are you okay?

203
00:59:57.188 --> 01:00:00.790
Yeah, I have, I
have a headache.


204
01:00:02.394 --> 01:00:04.087
How long have I been out?

205
01:00:04.129 --> 01:00:05.261
A few hours.

206
01:00:07.332 --> 01:00:11.294
Last thing I remember is
being taken down by stalkers.


207
01:00:11.336 --> 01:00:14.337
I, I didn't see you there.

208
01:00:16.007 --> 01:00:17.740
I had an idea where you were.

209
01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:20.810
What about the stalkers?

210
01:00:26.851 --> 01:00:27.850
I killed them.

211
01:00:30.088 --> 01:00:31.020
Wow.

212
01:00:33.158 --> 01:00:34.390
How did I get here?

213
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.826
I dragged you.

214
01:00:39.064 --> 01:00:40.196
You saved my life.

215
01:00:43.902 --> 01:00:44.801
Thank you.

216
01:00:47.872 --> 01:00:50.306
But it was a risk you
shouldn't have taken, Ellie.


217
01:00:51.209 --> 01:00:52.108
Why'd you do it?

218
01:00:53.845 --> 01:00:55.211
Because I care about you.

219
01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.110
Those feelings
you have for others,


220
01:01:01.152 --> 01:01:02.452
they make you vulnerable.

221
01:01:03.421 --> 01:01:05.214
They'll get you caught.

222
01:01:05.256 --> 01:01:07.156
I couldn't let
them take you away.


223
01:01:08.193 --> 01:01:09.926
You would have done
the same for me.


224
01:01:11.429 --> 01:01:14.497
No. No, Ellie,
I wouldn't have.


225
01:01:16.101 --> 01:01:17.994
I know that makes me
sound like a bad person,


226
01:01:18.036 --> 01:01:19.469
but that's just who I am.

227
01:01:21.272 --> 01:01:24.133
I won't put my life at
risk for anyone else.


228
01:01:24.175 --> 01:01:25.108
Even you.

229
01:01:27.779 --> 01:01:29.305
That's selfish.

230
01:01:29.347 --> 01:01:32.081
Yeah. It's also survival.

231
01:01:33.318 --> 01:01:35.912
Erase all feelings of sympathy
or compassion for others


232
01:01:35.954 --> 01:01:38.114
if you wanna exist
in this world.


233
01:01:38.156 --> 01:01:39.382
Cut and dry.

234
01:01:41.259 --> 01:01:42.992
I could never be like that.

235
01:01:49.768 --> 01:01:51.434
So you're a better
person than me.


236
01:01:53.171 --> 01:01:55.938
In the end it won't
matter.


237
01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:00.837
Where are our supplies?

238
01:02:00.879 --> 01:02:01.811
Too heavy.

239
01:02:03.014 --> 01:02:05.448
Okay. So they
know we're on foot.


240
01:02:06.918 --> 01:02:09.278
I'm sure they've set up a
perimeter of a mile or two.


241
01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.280
They're looking
for us right now.


242
01:02:11.322 --> 01:02:13.983
Especially since two of
their own were killed.


243
01:02:14.025 --> 01:02:15.952
We'll have take our
chances here for the night.


244
01:02:15.994 --> 01:02:19.088
There's no point in us
running around in the dark.


245
01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:20.757
Gotta put out this beacon.

246
01:04:10.909 --> 01:04:12.341
You smell it too?

247
01:04:17.448 --> 01:04:19.582
A lot of death in there.

248
01:04:38.937 --> 01:04:40.336
Yeah, this'll do.

249
01:05:23.448 --> 01:05:24.347
Hey.

250
01:05:28.252 --> 01:05:29.185
Shh!

251
01:05:51.242 --> 01:05:54.310
Jackpot.

252
01:06:15.566 --> 01:06:16.732
Are you serious?

253
01:06:18.503 --> 01:06:20.129
How are you gonna start it?

254
01:06:21.806 --> 01:06:24.000
Test a few tricks I know.

255
01:06:24.042 --> 01:06:25.508
First we gotta find the keys.

256
01:06:56.541 --> 01:06:57.433
Yes!

257
01:07:08.252 --> 01:07:10.179
You're getting rid of the gas?

258
01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:11.781
Shelf life is only
about two years.


259
01:07:11.823 --> 01:07:14.050
After that it's piss water.

260
01:07:14.092 --> 01:07:15.624
Good. Set them on the counter.

261
01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:20.823
What is that?

262
01:07:20.865 --> 01:07:22.658
It's Everclear.

263
01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:24.633
There's a chance it
could work as our fuel.


264
01:07:57.635 --> 01:07:58.567
Okay.

265
01:08:01.806 --> 01:08:02.738
Moment of truth.

266
01:08:18.156 --> 01:08:20.389
You can do a it, dammit!

267
01:08:23.461 --> 01:08:25.194
You are such a dork.

268
01:08:30.168 --> 01:08:31.527
Okay.

269
01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:34.170
This is the one.

270
01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:43.512
Hell yeah.

271
01:09:05.203 --> 01:09:06.402
- Woo-hoo!
- Woo!


272
01:09:07.205 --> 01:09:08.497
- Woo!
- Woo!


273
01:09:08.539 --> 01:09:09.939
Woo! Yeah, woo!

274
01:09:11.409 --> 01:09:13.435
- Hell yeah!
- Woo-hoo!


275
01:09:13.477 --> 01:09:14.543
Woo-hoo-hoo!

276
01:09:15.713 --> 01:09:16.645
Woo, yeah!

277
01:09:18.382 --> 01:09:19.315
Yeah!

278
01:09:20.585 --> 01:09:24.280
I can't remember the last
time I was this happy.


279
01:09:24.322 --> 01:09:25.921
It's been so long.

280
01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:28.784
Woo!

281
01:09:37.235 --> 01:09:40.302
Okay. We have enough fuel
for about three more miles.


282
01:09:41.372 --> 01:09:43.272
We don't wanna run
out on the open road.


283
01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:46.275
All right, I'm gonna pull off.

284
01:10:25.783 --> 01:10:27.483
- Quinn.
- I see her.


285
01:10:33.824 --> 01:10:36.752
Hey, hey, please!

286
01:10:36.794 --> 01:10:38.854
Take me with you, please!

287
01:10:38.896 --> 01:10:41.457
Get out of the road
or I will run you over.


288
01:10:41.499 --> 01:10:43.792
Hey, take me with you, please!

289
01:10:43.834 --> 01:10:45.361
I'm giving you three seconds,

290
01:10:45.403 --> 01:10:46.629
then your roadkill.

291
01:10:50.474 --> 01:10:51.974
No, wait, please!

292
01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.385
Don't do it.

293
01:11:04.822 --> 01:11:07.389
With one gun on you,
you might have a shot.


294
01:11:08.993 --> 01:11:10.326
But not with three

295
01:11:24.075 --> 01:11:25.674
Out of the car!

296
01:11:28.012 --> 01:11:29.812
Out of the car, bitches!

297
01:12:01.412 --> 01:12:03.639
Damn, that's some good timing.

298
01:12:03.681 --> 01:12:06.975
White suits everywhere and
now we got us a getaway car.


299
01:12:07.017 --> 01:12:08.083
And dinner.

300
01:12:10.755 --> 01:12:12.755
I'm gonna cook this
one up medium-rare.


301
01:12:16.394 --> 01:12:18.093
You're really gonna
taste so good.


302
01:12:24.234 --> 01:12:26.395
Oh, I'm gonna have
some fun with this one


303
01:12:26.437 --> 01:12:27.603
before I eat her.

304
01:12:30.975 --> 01:12:32.468
Eat this

305
01:13:01.205 --> 01:13:02.131
No!

306
01:13:06.644 --> 01:13:07.576
Ellie!

307
01:13:10.614 --> 01:13:12.741
Come on, get up.

308
01:13:12.783 --> 01:13:15.017
You're lucky. The bullet
went right through.


309
01:13:24.128 --> 01:13:25.227
Hurry, Ellie.

310
01:13:51.021 --> 01:13:53.255
Put pressure on the wound.

311
01:14:03.634 --> 01:14:05.461
Ellie, stay with me.

312
01:14:05.503 --> 01:14:09.231
It's so bad.

313
01:14:31.929 --> 01:14:33.095
Damn, out of fuel.

314
01:14:41.171 --> 01:14:42.104
Come on.

315
01:15:02.026 --> 01:15:03.819
Don't stop. Keep going.

316
01:15:07.798 --> 01:15:09.191
Come on, come on, Ellie, up!

317
01:15:09.233 --> 01:15:10.299
No, I can't.

318
01:15:11.135 --> 01:15:12.067
Ellie!

319
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:14.196
Ellie!

320
01:15:15.105 --> 01:15:16.732
Come on, up.

321
01:15:16.774 --> 01:15:17.599
No.

322
01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.312
Go.

323
01:20:59.182 --> 01:21:02.444
I surrender! I give up!

324
01:21:07.224 --> 01:21:08.924
I surrender.

325
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:03.578
Well, Ellie, we've
got plenty of fuel.


326
01:22:06.516 --> 01:22:11.086
We're gonna go somewhere
far, far away from here.


327
01:22:13.123 --> 01:22:14.489
Where they'll never find us.

328
01:22:21.231 --> 01:22:22.163
