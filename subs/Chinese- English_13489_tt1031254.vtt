对不起  我们不知道多久才能到这儿

Let's get you guys situated.


88
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.730
这所房子就像生意场中的所说的  "尚未雕琢的钻石"
So this is what we call in the business "a diamond in the rough."


89
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:53.190
它骨架很好  就是需要略微装修一下

95
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.910
然后从这出来  快来

99
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.090
注意台阶
Just watch that step there.


100
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.380
空气很新鲜

101
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.390

102
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.390
无视那个老头好了
Just ignore the old guy.


103
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.390
一个月650美元  你们觉得行吗
I was thinking 650 a month. How does that sound?


104
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.560
650
Six-fifty?


105
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.400
我知道  至少该要800美元一月  但我能怎么办呢
I know. I know. I could be getting at least 800. but what am I gonna do?


106
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.560
问你们要全价  你们是我的家人
Charge you guys full price? You're family.

Here's the keys. Remember. Jillian with a J.


110
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.090
我还以为她会免费让我们住这儿
-I thought she was gonna let us stay here for free.


111
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.920
我也这么想
Well. Yeah. So did I.


112
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.010
-这能用吗  -我觉得应该没问题
-Does this even work? -Yeah. I'm sure it's fine.


113
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.390
-接上电  掸掉灰  -不能用
-Plug it in. Dust it off. -It doesn't work.


114
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.350
妮可  你看这个
Hey. Nicole. Check this out.


115
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.940
上帝啊
Oh. My God.


116
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.400
把这东西放好  它得立起来
We're gonna put this up right now. These have got to go up.


117
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.610
搞不好碰上就受伤了
It's a safety hazard.


118
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.950
-挂在那个钉子上  那个  -等等  这儿
-Right there on that nail. Right there. -Oh. Oh. Wait. There?


119
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.120
这地方现在什么都有了
Now this place has everything.


120
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.870
克里斯  咱们在哪里睡
Chris. Where are we gonna sleep?


121
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.380
不  不  后面有卧室  还有蒲团
No. No. No. There's a bedroom back here. And we have that futon.


122
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.460
最好再找一个用过的蒲团  放在那边
Maybe we can pick up another futon. Used. For right over there.


123
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.920

125
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.590
我觉得这像大学宿舍  只是一点不酷
You know. I bet this is just like college. Only not cool.


126
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.060
你知道吗
You know what?


127
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.730
咱们先出去一会  好吗
Maybe we'll get out of here for a little bit. Okay?


128
00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.690
一会再整理行李  好吗
We can unpack later. Let's go.


129
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:53.890
好
Okay.


130
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.490
就在这儿
It's right here.


131
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.810
请问现在几点了
Hey. You wouldn't happen to have the time?


132
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.940
呃
Um Uh


133
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.520
事实上你戴着表  所以
You're actually wearing a watch. So


134
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:39.060
是
Yeah.


135
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.360
已经坏了
Yeah. I'm pretty sure it's broken. You know.


136
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.110
哦
Oh. Uh-huh.


137
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.110
你是克里斯·爱梅森  对吧
You're Chris Emerson. Right?


138
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.070
对对  你叫什么  哥们
Yeah. Yeah. What's your name. Man?


139
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.280
-阿历克斯  -嘿
-Alex. -Hey.


140
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.870
你被这次巡回赛淘汰真是太糟了
Dude. It's too bad you got kicked off the circuit.


141
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.460
你是自斯莱特和帕沃斯以来  最了不起的冲浪手
You were the most amazing surfer since Slater. Since Powers. Man.


142
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.790
-你完全把那些家伙整惨了  -谢谢  哥们  非常感谢
-You totally screwed that guy up. -Thanks. Dude. I appreciate that.


143
00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.880
你一个人在这儿干什么
So. What are you doing here alone?


144
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.090
有点怪异  是吧
That sounded kind of creepy. Didn't it?


145
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.010
有点
Yeah. A little.


146
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.720
我和我哥在一起
I'm here with my brother.


147
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.720
我之所以问这个  是因为女孩一个人在附近
Reason I asked is because it's not that safe around here


148
00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.850
不太安全  你知道吗
for girls to be alone. You know?


149
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.730
-可能又吓着你了  对不起  -是  是  有一点
-Creepy. Once again. Sorry. -Yeah. Yeah. A little bit.


150
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.770
不知道为什么  这个镇吸引了不少
Just. For whatever reason. This town manages to attract


151
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.690
稀奇古怪的人
a lot of freaks and weirdoes.


152
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.320
当然我这人并不古怪
Not that I'm a freak or a weirdo.


153
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.530
看来我还是闭嘴好了  对吧
I'm just gonna stop talking. Okay?


154
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.700
好的
Okay.


155
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.200
想看些好东西吗  去弗洛格兄弟的店就对了
Wanna check something real? Check out the Frog Brothers' shop.


156
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.370
我想找个活干
I'm looking for some work.


157
00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.580
这家店我打理的很好
I got the place pretty much handled.


158
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.920
是啊  我知道  看得出来
Yeah. I know. I can tell.


159
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.920
你看起来非常忙  我想找个做冲浪板的活
You seem really busy. But I was looking to shape.


160
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.630
这样的话  找弗洛格兄弟去吧
Well. In that case. Yeah. Check out Frog Brothers. Man.


161
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.930
他是附近唯一真正的冲浪板制造人
He's the only real shaper we have around here.


162
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.090
他的店在哪
Where's his shop at?


163
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.720
真不好说具体在什么地方  我给你画个地图
Man. It's in the ass-end of nowhere. But I'll draw you a map.


164
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.430
-我把电话号码给你  -这样就不怪异了
-I'm gonna give you my number. -Because that's not creepy.


165
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.020
-怪异吗  -我开玩笑的
-Is it? -I'm totally kidding.


166
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.270
好的  对不起
Okay. Sorry.


167
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.400
我都不知道你叫什么
I don't really even know your name.


168
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.240
-伊万  -我是妮可
-Evan. -I'm Nicole.


169
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.990
想找人出去玩的话给我打电话  给你
Just call me if you want somebody to hang out with. There you go.


170
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.280
酷
Cool.


171
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.870
应该就是这儿了
This should be it. Right up here.


172
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.880
真吸引人
Charming.


173
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.980
也许我疯了  可你觉得住在这儿的人
Call me crazy. But do you really think anyone who lives here


174
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.730
有能力花钱请你帮他们做冲浪板
would be able to pay you to shape?


175
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.990
试试也无妨啊
It doesn't hurt to try.


176
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.140
-好了  能走了吗  -不行  给我一张纸一支笔
-Okay. Can we go? -No. Hand me a piece of paper and a pen.


177
00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.970
干嘛
Why?


178
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.560
万一他没电话  我想让他知道到什么地方可以找到我
Just in case he doesn't have a phone. I want him to know where to find me.


179
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.600
对啊  对啊  把咱们的地址贴在
Oh. Yes. Yes. Leave our address


180
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.900
德州电钮杀人狂的拖车上
at the creepy Texas Chainsaw Massacre trailer.


181
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.770
好主意
It's a good plan.


182
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.750
我还是觉得这儿比咱们的地方好
I still think it's nicer than our place.


183
00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.100
你觉得淋浴器能用吗
And what do you think the state of the shower is?


184
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.430
不太可能
Not good.


185
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.900
我觉得还是试一下吧
I think I'm gonna give it a shot.


186
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.880
对不起  吓着你了
Sorry. Did I scare you?


187
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.600
不  抱歉  只是
No. Sorry. You just


188
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.810
我没听到你过来
I didn't hear you come up.


189
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.350
你想要幅画吗  可以存很久哦
You want a picture? It might last longer.


190
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.520
对不起  哥们  只是
Sorry. Man. Just


191
00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.320
你和肖恩·帕沃斯非常像
You look exactly like Shane Powers.


192
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.610
说的对
That makes sense.


193
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.820
到底发生了什么  你拥有一切
What the hell happened to you. Man? You had everything.


194
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.080
你是世界上最好的冲浪手  为什么突然消失的无影无踪
You were the greatest surfer in the world and you just disappeared?


195
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.330
我也想问你同样的问题
I could probably ask you the same question.


196
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.750
是吧
Right?


197
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.960
是啊  我不知道
Yeah. Well. I don't know.


198
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.840
事情还没平静下来  我他妈也不知道发生了什么
The dust hasn't settled yet so I don't know what the hell happened.


199
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.470
最好快点搞清楚
Well. Don't take too long to figure it out.


200
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.430
有一个改变人生的机会  我抓住了它
But I had a chance to change my life and I took it. You know.


201
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.430
人生得意须尽欢
Carpe diem.


202
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.730
今晚有安排吗
You got plans for tonight?


203
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.440
没
No.


204
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:16.900
我要办个冲浪派对
I'm having a surf party.


205
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.570
你应该过来  见见其他人
You should cruise over. Meet the rest of the guys.


206
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.620
他们都很棒
They're killer.


207
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.330
我能去吗
Can I come?


208
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.710
不行  我觉得这不是个好主意
No. I don't think it's a good idea.


209
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.540
为什么不行
Why not?


210
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.550
不知道  感觉不好  我不知道
I don't know. A gut feeling I have. I don't know.


211
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:36.800
我刚认识这人
I just met this guy.


212
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.880
得了吧  高中时你墙上都是他的海报
Oh. Please. You had a poster of him on your wall in high school.


213
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:44.430
这就说明我该去他家  他
So I wanna go hang out at his house? He's


214
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.720
有点怪异
He's kind of a weirdo.


215
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.560
-怪异才好呢  -怪异就是怪异  知道吗
-Weird is good. -No. Weird is weird. All right?


216
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.310
-我不去  你就别作梦了  -你说不去是什么意思
-I'm not going. So just save your breath. -What do you mean you're not going?


217
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.730
克里斯  怎么  起来
Chris. What are? No. Get up. Okay?

222
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.750
不知道你俩今晚有事没  但
I don't know if the two of you are busy tonight or not. But


223
00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.870
我租了"七宝奇谋"
I have got The Goonies.


224
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.500
你说啥
Excuse me?


225
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.340
"七宝奇谋"
The Goonies?


226
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.840
天哪  你们从没听说过"七宝奇谋"
Oh. My gosh. You mean to say the two of you have never heard of The Goonies?


227
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.470
这下可得好好补补了
You are in for a very serious treat.


228
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.760
事实上  我
Oh. Uh Actually. I mean. That


229
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:32.060
这个听起来很有意思  但我们今晚有事
Yeah. That sounds fun. But we actually have plans.


230
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.110
我们要去个派对
We're going to a party.


231
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.330
这挺好嘛
It's not gonna be that bad.


232
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.290
我先喝杯酒  再和你聊
Talk to me after I have a drink.


233
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.580
我马上将演示给你怎样做好一个
I'm about to show you how to make the badass

mother F.U.C.King sickest margarita recipe you've ever heard of.


235
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.090

a little bit of an orange liqueur, something to kind of...take the edge off that.


238

第四个也是非常神秘的配方是
The fourth and very secret


239
00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.840
把所有东西放进一个非常小的容器里

240
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.680
就像把一个地毯放进一个豌豆里那样
Kind of like that rug in The Big Lebowski.


241
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.350
这不是他妈的克里斯·爱梅森和他
And it's Chris-fucking-Emerson and his

也许咱们俩可以再在一起  妮可
Maybe we can get together again. Nicole.

-You bar-bitching? That your new job? -Not you. Maybe your hot sister. Though.


248
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.620
说到这儿  真是好久以前的事了
Speaking of which. It's been a long time.


249
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.080
-你穿着这个靴子很好看  -干嘛不闭上你那破嘴
-You're looking really good in those boots. -Why don't you stop being such an ass?

哦  对啦  滚吧
Ooh! Yeah. That's right. Walk away.

妮可  你真漂亮  越来越像熟女了
Nicole. You're looking good. You've really grown into yourself.


252
00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.420
-滚蛋  -打电话给我
-Fuck off. -Call me.


253
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.050
我告诉你这不是个好主意
I told you this was a bad idea.


254
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.340
忘了他吧  他只是想接近你
Forget about him. He's trying to get to you.


255
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.470
我不管  我不想再在这待下去了
I don't care. I'm not staying at this party.


256
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.640
克里斯  这太蠢了  咱们才刚到
Chris. No. That's stupid. We just got here.


257
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.060
我哪也不想去  克里斯  我想在这好好玩玩  好吗
I don't wanna go anywhere. Chris. I wanna stay and have a good time. Okay?


258
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.270
我又不是孩子了
I'm not a kid anymore.


259
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.600
我知道不是了  但保护你是我的责任  咱们走吧
I know you're not. But you're still my responsibility. So let's go.


260
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.570
我不会惹麻烦的  好吧  我保证
Okay. I won't get in trouble. Okay? I promise.


261
00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.360
我照顾好自己  你也照顾好自己  好吧
I'll take care of myself and you take care of yourself. Okay?


262
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.320
怎么了  哥们
Hey. Man. What's up? Yes. Dude.


263
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:52.030
哥们  太紧了  是吧
Dude. Right? That's tight. Bro.


264
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.620
现在先别看
Okay. Okay. Don't look now


265
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:58.290
但火盆边的小辣妹  正想方设法向你献媚呢
but that little hottie over there by the fire is giving you all kinds of love.


266
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.790
好好玩
Have fun.


267
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.600
嘿  妮可
Hey. Nicole.


268
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.930
妮可  妮可
Nicole. Nicole.


269
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.660
妮可  妮可
Nicole. Nicole.


270
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.580
-哇  -你要干什么
-Whoo! Woo-hoo. -Hey. What's your deal?


271
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.790
你去那边  一个人坐那儿
The deal is you're gonna go over there and sit by yourself


272
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.920
一个人喝你的玛格丽特酒
and you're gonna drink these margaritas by yourself.


273
00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.000
-不  不行  -强
-No. I'm not. -Jon.


274
00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.670
别不识相  兄弟
Better than the alternative. Bro.


275
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.900
极至美景  是吗
It's a hell of a view. Isn't it?


276
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.150
是啊  这里整个地方  太让人难以置信了
Yeah. The whole place. It's incredible.


277
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.990
我一看到它  就立刻想占为己有
Yeah. When I saw that view. I just knew I had to have this place.


278
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.410
我是肖恩
I'm Shane.


279
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.120
我是妮可
I'm Nicole.


280
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.000
妮可  带你四处逛逛怎么样
Well. Nicole. How about I give you a little tour?


281
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.960
行啊
Yeah. Okay.


282
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.850
你是要过来呢  还是整晚都看我跳舞
So are you gonna make your move or are you just gonna watch me dance all night?


283
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.070
我在等属于我的一刻
I was waiting for my moment.


284
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.820
我觉得你的那一刻并不想管你  牛仔
Seems to me like your moment almost passed you by. Cowboy.


285
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.240
我不知道  你正站在这和我聊天
I don't know. You're standing here talking to me.


286
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.410
只是因为我对冲浪小子没有防御能力
Only because I have a weakness for surfer boys.


287
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.990
还因为我知道你是谁
And because I know who you are.


288
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.950
你喜欢冲浪
You follow surfing?


289
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.540
冲浪手
Surfers.


290
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.880
我喜欢冲浪手
I follow surfers.


291
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.840
有时候他们也喜欢我
And sometimes they follow me.


292
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.020
太他妈难以置信了
This is un-fucking-believable.


293
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.960
哇
Wow.


294
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.580
-这地方太棒了  -谢谢
-This place is amazing. -Thank you.


295
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.670
你和你哥在一起生活
So do you and your brother get along?


296
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.010
大部分时间吧
Yeah. Well. Most of the time. You know.


297
00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.310
-不得不这样  -不得不  为什么
-Kind of have to. -You have to? Why's that?


298
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.430
因为我俩相依为命
Well. Because it's pretty much just us now.


299
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.610
几年前我们的父母死于车祸
Our parents died in a car accident a few years ago.


300
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:13.070
克里斯要远比我更难接受这一点
I think it was actually a lot harder on Chris than it was on me.


301
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.700
也许就是因为这个  他才失败了
You know. I think that's why he snapped.


302
00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.820
因为这个他才在巡回赛被踢出局
Is that why he got kicked off the circuit?


303
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.280
-是啊  -原来如此
-Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah.


304
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.240
失去了所有赞助商  想起来就很不愉快
And lost all his sponsors. Not the right image.


305
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:28.120
我们越来越穷  所以来这儿了
So we started running out of money and that's how we ended up here.


306
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.960
是啊
Yeah. Yeah.


307
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.840
你哥是个好小伙  是吧
Well. Your brother's a good guy. Huh?


308
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.880
他只是遇到了挫折  你俩都是
He just got a tough break. You both did.


309
00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.630
这个
Well


310
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.680
事实上我觉得死亡可以是件积极的事
I actually think death can be a positive thing.


311
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:43.100
因为
You know. Because


312
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.440
知道自己终将死去  能够让自己欣赏生活
knowing you're gonna die makes you appreciate life.


313
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.900
这就是所谓的及时行乐
The whole carpe diem thing.


314
00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.320
年轻人有这样的观点很有意思
That's an interesting view for someone so young.


315
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.780
我没那么年轻
I'm not that young.


316
00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.650
嗯
Well


317
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.660
死是生命的一部分
Dying is a part of living. You know?


318
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.240
我们每个人都会经历的  对吧
It's something that's gonna happen to all of us someday. Right?


319
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.410
那要看具体情况了
That depends.


320
00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.130
我想做个实验
I wanna try something.


321
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.640
把这朵枯萎的玫瑰放在你手上
I want you to take this dead rose in your hand.


322
00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.280
我相信  通过纯粹的意志力量
I believe that it's possible for us to change reality


323
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.030
我们有可能改变现实
through sheer force of will.


324
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.450
你觉得这可能吗
You think that's possible?


325
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.700
呃
Um


326
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.660
-我觉得会  -你觉得会还是你知道会
-I guess so. -You guess so or you know so?


327
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.380
-我知道  -你知道
-I know so. -You know so.


328
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.170
好的  闭上你的眼
Okay. Well. Then close your eyes.


329
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.550
闭上眼
Close your eyes.


330
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.050
注意力集中到玫瑰上
Now focus on this rose


331
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.560
想像一下它鲜活的时候是什么样子
and try to imagine what it must have been like when it was alive and vital.


332
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.310
感觉到了吗
Do you feel anything?


333
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.560
-当然  -嗯
-Definitely. -Mm-hm.


334
00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.360
睁开眼
Open your eyes.


335
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.200
天哪
Oh. My God.


336
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.990
你怎么做到的
How did you do that?


337
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.830
魔力
Magic.


338
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.960
不是我做到的
And I didn't do it


339
00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.170
我们做到的  我们一起
we did it. Together.


340
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:38.840
这是什么
What is it?


341
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.590
很不错  尝尝
It's good. Try it.


342
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.430
-闻起来不错  -嗯
-Smells good. -Mm-hm.


343
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.350
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?


344
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.730
我很喜欢
I like it.


345
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.490
-你还好吗  -是的
-You okay? -Yeah.


346
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.120
有点头晕
It just went right to my head.


347
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.210
出去呼吸点新鲜空气
You wanna go outside and get some fresh air?


348
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.840
好吗  咱们走
Yeah? Let's go.


349
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.150
想兜风去吗
You wanna go for a ride?


350
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.320
我不知道  外面有点冷
I don't know. It's kind of cold out.


351
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.030
哪它就派上用场了
Well. That's what this is for.


352
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.340
-嘿  强  强  -嘿
-Yo. Jon-Jon. -Hey.


353
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.930
看那个帅哥
Watch the pretty boy there.


354
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.470
咱们过去  让他开开眼
So here we are. Let's show him a little something.


355
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.850
-行  -现在走吧
-Yeah. -Come. Now.


356
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.020
-要不要和我上楼去  -你  卡尔
-Why don't you come upstairs with me -Yo. Kyle.


357
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.360
妈的  怎么了
What the fuck?


358
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.700
发生什么了  怎么了
What is it? What?


359
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.990
妈的  太他妈疼了  这可不好玩儿
Fuck. It fucking stings. Man. That's not cool.


360
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.330
你他妈混蛋  我正想把那妞搞上床呢
Fucking asshole. Man. I'm trying to get fucking laid.


361
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.500
这他妈还是件新衬衣  过来  过来
This is a fucking brand-new shirt. Prick. Come here. Come here.


362
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.790
过来  把他妈刀给我
Come here. Give me the fucking knife.


363
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.630
操你妈
What the fuck?


364
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.510
-过来  -他倒了
-Come back here. -Oh. Down he goes.


365
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:46.380
对不起
I'm sorry.


366
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.130
对不起  我得走了
I'm sorry. I gotta go.


367
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.220
我得去看看我妹妹
I have to go check on my sister.


368
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.930
-你妹妹  -对不起
Your sister? -Sorry.


369
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.850
你喜欢那样  我可以那么干
So you go that way. Huh? I can do that.


370
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.770
-对不起  我得走了  -等等  别走
-Sorry. I gotta go. -Wait. Don't leave.


371
00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.310
-我得走了  -别走
-I gotta go. -Don't leave.


372
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.520
-真的  -别走  留下
-Come on. -Don't. Stay.


373
00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.150
-对不起  -过来
-Sorry. -Come.


374
00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.970
感觉好点了
Feel better?


375
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.010
-好多了  -真的
-Much. -Yeah?


376
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.460
我保证她现在很好  她和肖恩在一起
I'm sure she's fine. She's with Shane.


377
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:45.960
肖恩是个好人
You know. Shane's a good guy.


378
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.170
如果我是你  一定会为你妹与肖恩在一起高兴的
If I were you. I'd be happy that he's into your sister.


379
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.850
从摩托上下来
Hey. Get off the bike.


380
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.060
-干嘛  克里斯  -怎么了  伙计
-What? Chris. -What's up. Buddy?


381
00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.980
-从摩托上下来  -有问题吗
-Get off the bike. -Is there a problem?


382
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.940
伙计  这是我和我妹妹之间的事
No. Dude. This is between me and my sister. Man. Thank you.


383
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.360
她能照顾好自己  伙计  相信我
She can handle herself. Man. Believe me.


384
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.860
-克里斯  -妈的
-Chris. -Oh. Hell. No.


385
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.860
-克里斯  -强
-Chris. -Jon.


386
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.530
-冷静点  -放他走
-Take it easy. -Let him go.


387
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.160
-冷静  -放手
-Calm down. -Get off of me.


388
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.780
-你保护过度了吧  -她是我家人  垃圾
-Overprotective much? -She's my family. Asshole.


389
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.700
冷静下来  混蛋  安静
Cool it. Bitch. Settle down.


390
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.410
-放他走  -什么
-Let him go. -What?


391
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.040
让他走
Let him go.


392
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.050
你他妈离我妹妹远点
Stay the hell away from my sister.


393
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:36.640
放手
Don't.


394
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.890
离"美宜堡"远点  混蛋
Stay the hell out of Malibu. Lebowski.


395
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.390
别像个玻璃一样走路
Stop walking like a fag.


396
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.670
我就知道咱们不应该去派对
-I knew we shouldn't have gone to that party.


397
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.670
我希望你做到两点  可你却完全无视
I asked you. Like. To do two things. And you completely ignore me.


398
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.050
别和不认识的男人出去玩儿
Do not hang out with some dude you don't know


399
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.680
别去那个男人的屋里
and don't go up to his room to party with the guy.


400
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.600
-好了  克里斯  我知道了  -怎么回事
-Okay. Chris. I get it. -What is that?


401
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.520
别说了
Stop it.


402
00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.940
-应该告诉我你去了哪  -够了  别说了
-Should have told me where you were -That's enough. Stop it.


403
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.520
别表现的像是我爸似的
Stop trying to be my dad.


404
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.900
上帝啊
Oh. My God.


405
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.320
上帝啊
Oh. My God.


406
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.910
克里斯  我现在很不对劲
Chris. Something is seriously wrong with me right now.


407
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.410
你哪也没出问题  只不过喝多了
Nothing's wrong with you. You're just drunk.


408
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.920
克里斯  我没喝多
Chris. I am not drunk.


409
00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:48.380
我特不对劲儿
Something is seriously the matter with me.


410
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.910
好  坚持一下  好吗  我们快到家了
Okay. Just hang on a little bit. All right? We're almost home.


411
00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.220
天哪  我要
Oh. My God. Oh. My God. I'm gonna


412
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.600
我的胃
My stomach.


413
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.890
好了  你看  快到了
Look. All right. We're almost there.


414
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.690
我告诉你  我身体有了严重的问题
I'm telling you. There is something seriously the matter.


415
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.520
没事  你只需要喝一杯水和几片雅维
You're fine. You just need a glass of water and some Advil.


416
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:13.730
好了  你就是喝多了
All right. You're just drunk.


417
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.320
我没醉
I am not drunk.


418
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.070
-妮可  妮可  -我病了
-Nicole. Nicole. -I'm sick.


419
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.920
你是克里斯·爱梅森  我是埃德加·弗洛格
Chris Emerson? I'm Edgar Frog.


420
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.920
冲浪板制造者  吸血鬼猎手
Surfboard shaper and vampire hunter.


421
00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.880
什么
What?


422
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.930
-嘿  别  -你在干什么
-Hey. Get -What are you doing?


423
00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.030
听我说  你不知道自己在干什么
You don't know what you're doing.


424
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.940
我正设法救你们  你妹妹被感染了
I'm trying to save you. Your sister's infected.


425
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.600
-你在说什么  -她现在是不死之身了
-What are you talking about? -She's one of the undead.


426
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.150
从
Get


427
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.020
从我房子里滚出去
Get out of my house.


428
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.610
你会后悔的  朋友
It's your funeral. Pal.


429
00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.560
我告诉你  从这滚出去
I told you to get the hell out of here. Man.


430
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.060
嗨
Hi.


431
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.570
嗨
Hi.


432
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.570
咱们开始做的事还没结束
We didn't get to finish what we started.


433
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.320
是
Yeah.


434
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.280
不请我进去吗
Well. Aren't you gonna invite me in?


435
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.500
现在不是时候
Now's not the best time.


436
00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.420
行
Yeah.


437
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.180
好了  请进
Okay. Come on in.


438
00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.690
你知道吗  对不起  我不能这样
You know what? I'm sorry. I'm not


439
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:18.360
-我不能这样  我妹妹在后面  -我看能不能让你改变心意
-I can't do this with my sister back there. -Let me see if I can change your mind.


440
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.070
好吗
Yeah?


441
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.170
你味道真好
You taste good.


442
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.300
嘿
Oh. Hey.


443
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.350
丽莎  下来  停下
Lisa. Get off. Stop.


444
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:55.140
丽莎  停下
Lisa. Stop it.


445
00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:58.980
真的  你有毛病吗
Seriously. Get What's the matter with you?


446
00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.190
停下  真的  停下
Stop. Seriously. Stop.


447
00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.150
从我身上下来
Get off me.


448
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.490
丽莎  下来
Lisa. Get off.


449
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.950
丽莎  下来
Lisa. Get off.


450
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.350
丽莎
Lisa?


451
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.810
哦  天哪
Oh. My God. Oh. My God.


452
00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.290
妈的  怎么回事
What the fuck?


453
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.060
嘿  哥们
Hey. Man. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hey. Whoa.


454
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.560
我直说了吧  我帮你摆脱那玩意
Let's get something straight. I let you get away with that shit


455
00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:22.570
是因为我知道失去家人的感觉
because I understand what it's like to lose a family member to the other side.


456
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:27.030
如果它再出现一次  你得站在正确立场上  听懂了没
If it happens again. You're gonna end up on the wrong side of the stake. Are we clear?


457
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.110
-嗯  -好
-Mm-hm. -Good.


458
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.990
听着  我只是
It's cool. Man. Look. I just


459
00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.290
我不知道怎么回事  明白吗
I don't understand what's going on. All right?


460
00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.910
你说我妹妹被感染了
You said my sister was infected?


461
00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.250
你妹妹成了不死族的一员
Your sister's become a member of the undead.


462
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.420
夜晚出没  吸人鲜血
A night stalker. A bloodsucker.


463
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.050
就像诺斯·费拉图
Nosferatu.


464
00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.760
你妹妹成了吸血僵尸
Your sister's a suck monkey.


465
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.840
哥们  这太荒谬了
Dude. That's That's ridiculous. Man.


466
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:55.510
荒谬  那你现在为什么来这里
Ridiculous? Then what are you doing here?


467
00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:59.480
你离开我  我家发生了非常怪异的事
Look. Some crazy shit happened at my place after you left.


468
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.270
什么"怪异的事"
Define "crazy shit."


469
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:05.570
一个小妞来我家
Well. This This chick came into my house and


470
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:10.570
她长出獠牙  变成石头  最后爆炸了
And she sprouted fangs and then she turned into stone and exploded.


471
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.370
这才叫荒谬
Now. That's just ridiculous.


472
00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.290
吸血鬼是不会石化然后爆炸的
Vampires don't just turn into stone and then explode.


473
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.920
想让它们死必须用利器刺穿心脏
They have to be pierced through the heart with a sharp object.


474
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.040
我想鹿角也许起了这个作用
You know. I guess the antlers could have done that.


475
00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:27.630
我原以为它可能是木制的
I thought it had to be a wooden stake or something.


476
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.380
这就是神秘之处  任何利器都可以
That's a myth. Any sharp object will do.


477
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.930
事实上  它并不用很锋利
As a matter of fact. It doesn't have to be sharp.


478
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.810
钝器也可以  只要刺穿心脏就行
It can be a blunt object. As long as it pierces the heart.


479
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.470
我说我妹妹也成为它们中的一员
You said my sister was one of them?


480
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.350
-怎么会这样  -有两种可能
-But how would that happen? -One of two ways:


481
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.100
首先  她可能被咬了
Either A. She was bit


482
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:47.270
或者她喝了吸血鬼首领的血
or B. She drank the blood of the head vampire.


483
00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.650
你怎么会这么了解吸血鬼
How do you know so much about vampires?


484
00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.570
漫画  我的朋友  我是从漫画中学的
Comic books. My friend. Comic books.


485
00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.990
我向你寻求解答  你却告诉我你是从漫画里学的
I ask you for answers and you give me comic books?


486
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.790
看漫画能学到好多有用的东西
A lot of valuable information can be gained by reading comic books.


487
00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:01.660
比如
For example


488
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.460
看到了没
see here?


489
00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.170
这个可怜的笨蛋  正在喝吸血鬼首领的血
This poor sap's drinking the blood of the head vampire.


490
00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.920
它们把血放在酒杯当中骗人喝下去
They like to trick people by putting it into wine bottles.


491
00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.160
朋友  你喝的是什么
Dude. What are you drinking. Man?


492
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:44.830
弗洛格汁
Frog Juice.


493
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.040
大蒜  圣水和生鸡蛋
Garlic. Holy water and raw eggs.


494
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.550
好  你认为  根据漫画所说
Okay. So what you're saying is. Based on a comic book


495
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.220
我妹妹喝了血  成了吸血鬼
my sister drank blood and now she's a vampire.


496
00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.970
半  她是半吸血鬼
Half. She's only half vampire.


497
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:02.180
杀人以后  她才会变成完全的吸血鬼
She won't make the transition to full bloodsucker until she makes her first kill.


498
00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:05.560
-好吧  -事实上  这的确很好
-Great. -That is great. Actually.


499
00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:09.150
这意味着还有时间挽救她人类的灵魂
Because it means you still have time to save her mortal soul.


500
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:15.030
你需要做的就是  在她吸血之前  杀掉吸血鬼首领
All you have to do is kill the head vampire before she feeds.


501
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.740
有人么
Hello?


502
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:46.000
有人么
Hello?


503
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.750
门开着
It's open.


504
00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.840
嗨
Hi.


505
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.420
我带了酒
I brought wine.


506
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.690
我喜欢酒
I love wine.


507
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.040
老实说  我真没想到你有那么喜欢我
To be honest. I really didn't think you dug me all that much.


508
00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.800
-为什么这么想  -只是一种感觉而已
-Why would you think that? -Just a vibe I got. I guess.


509
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.550
现在有什么样感觉
What vibe are you getting now?


510
00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.180
太棒了
A really good one.


511
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.660
-妮可  -妈的
-Nicole. -Oh. Shit.


512
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.740
你  你做了她么
Did? Did you do it?


513
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:09.500
-滚出去  -我们什么都没干
-Get the hell out of here. -We didn't do anything. Man.


514
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:12.920
我不知道你俩是天主教徒还是什么
Dude. I didn't know you guys were born-again Christians or whatever.


515
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.750
我没有和你妹妹发生关系
Man. I'm not using your sister.


516
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.300
-嗯  很高兴听到这个  谢谢  -我真的喜欢她
-Yeah. Good to know. Thank you. -I really like her.


517
00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:08.970
我有一个好消息  也有一个坏消息
-This is basically one of those. Like. Good news bad news scenario things.


518
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.680
你先听哪个
What do you want first?


519
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.770
妈的  先听坏消息吧
Oh. Shit. Okay. The bad news.


520
00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:17.480
好  坏消息是那天肖恩给你的酒
Okay. The bad news is that the wine that Shane gave you the other night


521
00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.980
实际是并不是酒  而是血
wasn't wine. All right. It was blood.


522
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.480
肖恩的血
Shane's blood.


523
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.650
好
Right.


524
00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.380
好了  克里斯  我知道你不喜欢这人
Okay. Chris. I know you don't like the guy.


525
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.660
但是  这也太恶心了
But. Like. That's disgusting.


526
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.160
不  因为喝了他的血  你变成了吸血鬼
No. And by drinking his blood. You've been turned into a vampire.


527
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.660
对  我是吸血鬼  克里斯  太好了
Right. I'm a vampire. Chris. Great.


528
00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:37.460
别这么招人讨厌  我不是吸血鬼
Stop being such an asshole. I'm not a freaking vampire.


529
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.920
我不是招人讨厌
I'm not being an asshole. Nicole.


530
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.720
我知道这听起来很荒谬  但是你看
I know it sounds ridiculous. But take a look.


531
00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.090
什么东西消失了
See anything missing?


532
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.760
你
You.


533
00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.730
不  是吸血鬼  你不是想和那人发生关系
No. Vampire. You weren't gonna make out with that kid


534
00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:57.100
而是想吃他
you were gonna eat him.


535
00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.520
你长了獠牙  眼神很疯狂  我全看见了
You had fangs and crazy eyes. I saw it all.


536
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.450
好吧  好消息最好确实非常好
Okay. The good news better be really fucking good.


537
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.330
好消息简直是棒极了  知道吗
No. The good news is great news. Okay?


538
00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.240
听着  现在你只是半吸血鬼
See. Right now you're only. Like. Half of a vampire.


539
00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:16.290
意味着你可以变回人类
Which means you can be turned back human.


540
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.540
只要艾迪和我在你吃人之前  杀掉吸血鬼首领
As long as Eddie and I kill the head vampire before you feed.


541
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:21.960
-所以谁也不要吃  -什么  谁是艾迪
-So just don't eat anyone. -What? Who's Eddie?


542
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:23.880
艾迪·弗洛格  他是个吸血鬼杀手
Eddie Frog. He's a vampire slayer.


543
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:27.010
-我以为他是个做冲浪板的  -呃  他也是
-I thought he was a surfboard shaper. -Well. That too.


544
00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.390
对  好的
Right. Okay.


545
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:33.600
咱们把事情说清楚  你要和
Let me just get this straight then. So you've teamed up


546
00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.270
一个冲浪制造板以及  吸血鬼杀手联合起来
with a surfboard-shaper-slash-vampire-hunter


547
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:39.310
去杀我非常喜欢的那个人
so you can kill this guy who I'm totally crushing on


548
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.520
从而把我从永远的天谴中解救出来
so you can save me from eternal damnation?


549
00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:45.530
-差不多就这样  -对  差不多就是这样
-Is that pretty much it? -Yeah. That's pretty much it.


550
00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:54.080
-不  冷静  冷静  -不  克里斯  我不会冷静的
-No. Calm down. Calm down. -No. Chris. I'm not gonna calm down.


551
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.990
-不  -你怎么了
-No. -What's wrong with you?


552
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.250
我想吃那个人  你意识到了吗
I tried to eat that guy. Do you realize that?


553
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.040
你知道我有多么想喝人血吗
Do you know what it's like for me to want to drink blood?


554
00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:04.500
你知道这有多恶心吗  我是个素食主义者
Do you know how disgusting that is? I'm a vegetarian.


555
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.330
他藏在1号门后
Is he behind Door Number 1?


556
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:19.120
2号门
Door Number 2?


557
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:21.620
或者是
Or Door Number


558
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:23.870
3号门

559
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.360
咱们遇到麻烦了
We're screwed.


560
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.950
有许多地方  都可能是他们的老巢
There's just too many places where the nest could be.


561
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.870
我已经告诉你肖恩是吸血鬼头目
Look. I already told you. Shane's the head vampire.


562
00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:00.330
我们几天前在他家参加过一次派对
We went to party at his house a couple nights ago.


563
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:02.450
那里一定就是老巢
It's gotta be the nest.


564
00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:05.870
自重的吸血鬼
There's no way that any self-respecting vampire


565
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.000
绝对不会住在像那样的地方
would ever live in a place like that.


566
00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:09.260
我的意思是
I mean.


567
00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.710
它们也许把那个地方当作陷阱  也许在那里吃人
They may use it as a lure or a place to feed


568
00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.220
但它们绝对不会在那里睡觉
but they'd never sleep there.


569
00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.340
吸血鬼
Vampires


570
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.720
总会找人类遭受过苦难的地方
always look for a place with a history of human suffering.


571
00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.190
幽深  黑暗  阴冷的地方
Deep, dark, dank places.


572
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:30.820
不见天日的地方
Places that never see the light of day.


573
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.530
爬满寄生虫的地方
Places with lots of vermin.


574
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:38.320
充满腐烂泥土气息的地方
Places that smell of rot and earth


575
00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.700
和老化的
and decay.


576
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.760
妮可
Nicole.


577
00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:02.310
妮可
Nicole.


578
00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:31.250
妮可
Nicole.


579
00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:36.840
快点
Hurry.


580
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.230
快点
Hurry.


581
00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:56.440
我们不可能找到老巢在哪里
There's no way we can find out where the nest is


582
00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:59.110
除非打入它们内部
without you being in their inner circle.


583
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.200
好  那我去
Well. Then that's what I'll do.


584
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.990
把他们带出来
I'll get back in with them.


585
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.620
-我要先成为它们的一员  -别这么蠢  行吗
-I'm gonna become one of them. -Don't be stupid. All right?


586
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:09.040
他们能在你之前阅读你的思想
They can read your thoughts before you have them.


587
00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:12.000
得了吧  她是我的家人  混蛋
Come on. Man. She's family. Asshole.


588
00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:21.640
你感情用事了
You hit a soft spot there.


589
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.350
我知道失去兄弟姐妹的滋味
I know what it's like to lose a sibling.


590
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:31.440
如果你要打入内部  就得一直在内部待下去
If you're gonna do this. Then you have to do it all the way.


591
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:34.150
我的意思是  你首先得受它诱使堕落
I mean. You have to be seduced by it.


592
00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:36.860
屈从于它
You have to succumb to it.


593
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:42.990
你得一直在他们内部  直到快要完全变成吸血鬼
You have to take it all the way to the brink of becoming a full vampire.


594
00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:47.290
然后在最后关头  再背叛他们
And then you have to betray them at the last possible moment.


595
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.960
你觉得你能做到吗
Do you think you can really handle that?


596
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.330
只能这么干了  艾迪
It's the only way. Eddie.


597
00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:54.710
埃德加
Edgar.


598
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.840
对不起  埃德加
Sorry. Edgar.


599
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.130
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right.


600
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:07.510
这是一场危险的游戏
It's a dangerous game.


601
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:10.980
一场极有可能输的游戏
And it's one that you're likely to lose.


602
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:13.900
一定要知道
So just know


603
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.020
如果你忘记了自己的立场
if you forget your place


604
00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.860
你也成了吸血鬼
and you become one of them


605
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.160
我也会杀你
l'll be coming for you.


606
00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.070
这玩意真酷
This shit's cool.


607
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:44.280
卡尔  别他妈自己玩了  游戏要开始了
-Yo. Kyle. Stop playing with yourself. Man. The game gonna start.


608
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.150
-妈的骗我  -你知道吗
-Fucking cheater. -You know what?


609
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.070
-我叫你了  布雷森  -你没有
-I been calling you. Brethren. -You haven't been calling me.


610
00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.580
闭嘴
Shut up.


611
00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:53.790
总打得你屁滚尿流
Always with your crying.


612
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:56.920
-快退游戏  居然骗我  -听着  别哭
-Dude. Quit it. Fucking cheater. -Listen. Don't start crying.


613
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.670
你看  你看
Check it out. Check it out.


614
00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:00.340
录下来
Tape them.


615
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:02.300
-快录下来  -想溜
-Tape them. Man. -Skin out.


616
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.170
-好辣啊  -看她的屁股
-So nice. -Backside.


617
00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.760
-对头  你个混蛋  -妈的
-Yeah. Bitch. -Holy fuck.


618
00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:15.020
-你他妈有病啊  -操你妈
-What the fuck is your problem? -Motherfucker.


619
00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:18.140
-你死定了  -你打我啊  呵呵
-You're a dead man. -Yeah. Fucking blow me. Buddy. Again.


620
00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:20.360
-这下轮到谁骗谁了  -白人垃圾
-Who's the cheater now? -Fucking white people.


621
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.110
把它拉出来  没心情和你玩
Pull this out. I ain't playing.


622
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:25.360
-这个视频会在网上传得到处都是  -闭嘴  滚蛋
-You're gonna be all over the fucking Net. -Stop. Fuck off.


623
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:27.400
你的血喷得到处都是
Dude. You're fucking squirting everywhere.


624
00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:28.860
-你是个喷壶  -肖恩
-You're a squirter. -Shane.


625
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:56.220
我哥怎么办
What about my brother?


626
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.020
我不想失去他
I don't wanna lose him.


627
00:52:58.180 --> 00:52:59.770
你不会的
You won't.


628
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.570
相信我
Trust me.


629
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:51.800
全名
Full name?


630
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:53.680
呃  妮可
Uh. Nicole.


631
00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:56.510
爱
Em


632
00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.350
爱梅森
Emerson.


633
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.060
好的  我们会联系你的
All right. We'll call you.


634
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:04.730
这就完了  把她的名字输到电脑里
That's it? Just gonna type her name onto a computer


635
00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.360
寄希望于别人像小狗一样把她交回来
and hope someone turns her in like a dog pound?


636
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.280
-怎么这么被动  -孩子  我们有失踪系统
-Isn't that kind of passive? -Son. We have a system.


637
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.650
长官  你们肯定能做些什么
Officer. There's gotta be something you can do


638
00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.860
-警长  -警长  对不起
-Sheriff. -Sheriff. I'm sorry.


639
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.450
我真的非常担心她
I'm really worried about her.


640
00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:19.870
在周边地区有许多失踪了
We have a lot of missing persons around here.


641
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.200
我知道  但如果他们不是失踪呢
I know. I mean. What if they're not missing. You know?


642
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:24.870
还有其他可能
It could be something else.


643
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.130
孩子  走吧  我们有失踪系统
Son. Hit the road. We have a system.


644
00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.710
月亮湾  麦克格雷警长
Luna Bay. Sheriff McGraw.


645
00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:34.840
真的  多大
Really? How big?


646
00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.890
上周我钓到25磅重的一条
Yeah. Last week I caught about a 25-pounder.


647
00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.230
没什么用  是吧
Not very helpful. Huh?


648
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.450
我想问问他们能不能帮忙寻找丽莎
Yeah. I was gonna ask them if they could help us find Lisa.


649
00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:58.280
好几天没见她了
Haven't seen her in a couple of days.


650
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.740
上次我不是还见你和她在一起吗
Hey. Didn't I see you with her last?


651
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:06.500
我妹妹在哪儿
Where's my sister. Man?


652
00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:09.250
对了  你妹妹
Oh. Yeah. Your sister.


653
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.130
大概一小时前我见过她
Man. I saw her like an hour ago.


654
00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:13.590
看起来她度过一段非常美妙的时光
She looked like she was having a really good time.


655
00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.260
我妹妹到底他妈的在哪儿
Where the hell is my sister. Man?


656
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:19.140
放松点  小男人  好吗
Oh. Hey. Hey. Relax. Little man. Okay?


657
00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:23.720
我告诉你  你最好冷静一点
Trust me when I tell you this is. Right here. A time that you wanna keep your cool


658
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.390
如果你还想见到妮可的话
if you ever wanna see Nicole again.


659
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:35.190
你想要什么
What do you want?


660
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:38.280
不是我想要什么  兄弟
It's not what I want. Bro


661
00:56:38.910 --> 00:56:41.160
而是肖恩想要什么
it's what Shane wants.


662
00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.620
上车
Get in the car.


663
00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.080
怎么样  女士们
How's it. Ladies?


664
00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.670
吸血鬼杀手先生  过得好吗
Mr. Vampire Slayer. How you doing?


665
00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.550
你还好吗
You okay?


666
00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:43.340
我很好
I'm good.


667
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:45.310
非常好
I'm really good.


668
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:51.690
昨晚很抱歉
Sorry about last night. Man.


669
00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:55.230
你在保护自己的妹妹
You were protecting your sister.


670
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:57.860
我知道
I get it.


671
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:01.280
但我从来没有伤害过她
But I'd never do anything to hurt her.


672
00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:04.870
事实上  如果你进一步了解一下
In fact. Once you understand it a little more.


673
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:07.700
你会发现我送给了妮可一份礼物
You'll see I've given Nicole a gift.


674
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:13.670
你知道对死亡的恐惧  多么限制你吗  克里斯
Do you know how much the fear of death has limited you. Chris?


675
00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.460
它对你的一生有多大的消极作用
The negative impact it's had on your life?


676
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.760
你可能都没考虑过这些
You're probably not even aware of it.


677
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.090
我不是只在谈你自己对死亡的恐惧
And I'm not just talking about the fear of your own death. No.


678
00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:28.890
看看失去亲人的恐惧  对你造成了多大的影响
Look at what the fear of losing your loved ones has done to you.


679
00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.440
你这么担心失去妮可
You've been so worried about losing Nicole


680
00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:36.810
以致于变得歇斯底里  有过度保护倾向
that it's made you paranoid and overprotective.


681
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:40.780
我能带走这份恐惧
I can take that fear away.


682
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:44.820
我能让你成为家庭的真正一部分  克里斯
I can make you part of a real family. Chris.


683
00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.080
永远不会消亡的家庭
One that never dies.


684
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:54.000
卡尔的家庭很久以前就把他注销掉了
Kyle's human family wrote him off a long time ago.


685
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:57.000
他们以为他死于自杀
They thought he was suicidal.


686
00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:59.340
但我看见了真实的他
But I saw him for what he truly was


687
00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:02.300
一个对肾上腺素上瘾的人
an adrenaline junkie.


688
00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:07.850
艾瑞克  他的过去我们说的越少越好
Erik. Well. The less we say about his past. The better.


689
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:12.270
我们不想让你成为犯罪后的从犯  对吧
We wouldn't wanna make you an accessory after the fact. Now would we?


690
00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.850
小强尼
And Jonny boy. Well


691
00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:21.900
你打碎他的膝盖后  他原以为再也不能冲浪了
after you shattered his knee. He was never supposed to surf again.


692
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.400
看看他现在
Look at him now.


693
00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:26.950
比以往任何时候都强壮  兄弟
Stronger than ever. Bro.


694
00:59:28.570 --> 00:59:32.330
要想真正了解我们是什么  克里斯
But for you to truly understand what we are. Chris


695
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.420
你必须用我们的方式来理解世界
you have to see the world the way we do.


696
00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.500
你和你妹妹
You and your sister


697
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.960
永远不会变老
will never grow old


698
00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:44.800
永远不会死  再也不知道恐惧是什么
you'll never die and you'll never know fear again.


699
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:48.430
但首先你得先拿着这个
But you have to take that first step.


700
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:04.940
要干什么
And what's that?


701
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:10.700
我和男孩们想出来的一点小乐子
It's a little something me and the boys came up with.


702
01:00:38.350 --> 01:00:41.060
勇士们
Warriors.


703
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:45.280
-怎么  -出来玩玩
-What the? -Come out to play.


704
01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.030
咱们走
Let's go.


705
01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.260
哦  妈的
Oh. Shit.


706
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:11.720
走  走
Now! Now!


707
01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:35.240
抓紧
Yo. Hold up.


708
01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.460
让他出来  卡尔
Let him out. Kyle.


709
01:01:58.310 --> 01:01:59.600
喜欢吗  婊子
How do you like that. Bitch?


710
01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.770
走  走
Go. Go.


711
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.140
跳  克里斯
Jump it. Chris.


712
01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.310
妈的
Fuck you!


713
01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.150
-妈的  -是啊
-Fuck you. -Yeah.


714
01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:04.170
滚蛋
Fuck you!


715
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.100
喜欢吗
How do you like that?


716
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.850
无与伦比
Hey. On top of the world. Ma.


717
01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.690
等等  兄弟
Hold on. Brother.


718
01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.570
这是家私人俱乐部  你还不是会员
It's a private club and you're not a member.


719
01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.950
的确  还不是
Not yet. Anyway.


720
01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.950
如果我说愿意加入呢
Well. What if I say yes?


721
01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:42.830
仔细考虑一下  克里斯
Think long and hard about it. Chris.


722
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.370
一旦加入我们  就没回头路了
Once you join the tribe. There's no turning back.


723
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:06.940
你的支票被退回了
Your check bounced.


724
01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:10.940
不  只是  我把钱转移下帐户
No. It's I transferred some money from one account to the other. So


725
01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:15.110
别费话了  我要你马上给我新的押金
Save the bull for your buddies. I'm gonna need a new security deposit immediately.


726
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.740
必须是现金支票或是汇票
It's gonna need to be in the form of a cashier's check or a money order.


727
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:21.580
也许是我的错  给了你们一个错误印象
Maybe this is my fault. Maybe I gave the wrong impression.


728
01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.370
好了  不是什么大事  再等两天好吗
Come on. It's not that big of a deal. Just wait two days.


729
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.750
让我说完  摘掉太阳镜好吗
Just let me finish. Could you please take your sunglasses off?


730
01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.080
不看着你的眼睛  我没法和你说话
I can't talk to you unless I can see your eyes.


731
01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:33.380
听着  我不想让你们觉得我想插手
Look. I didn't want you guys to feel like I was trying to step in


732
01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:36.970
扮演你们父母的角色  但你们玩得也太疯了吧
and act like your parents. But that doesn't mean you can go crazy here.


733
01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:41.720
我看见你妹妹和一个男人上床  她才多大
I saw your sister had a guy over last night. How old is she?


734
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:45.180
-差不多快18了  -那就是说她今年才17
-She's almost. Like. 18. -That means she's 17 years old.


735
01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:48.730
你整天整晚的出出进进
And you coming and going at all hours of the day and night


736
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:51.480
我仔细想过
You know. I have a reputation to think of. L


737
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:53.770
虽然我不是你们的妈妈
I realize I am not your mother. But


738
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.740
但你们  不能在我的地盘上为所欲为
But you Doesn't mean you can behave like this on my property.


739
01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.780
好的  对不起
All right. I'm sorry.


740
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:04.870
是啊  我也一样
Yeah. Me too.


741
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:10.120
晚上派对  白天睡觉
Partying all night. Sleeping all day.


742
01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.090
你们不能像吸血鬼一样活着
You both need to quit acting like a couple of vampires.


743
01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.640
太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.


744
01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.290
你和你妹妹
You and your sister


745
01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.580
永远不会变老
will never grow old


746
01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:56.550
永远不会死  再也不知道恐惧是什么
you'll never die and you'll never know fear again.


747
01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.730
你吸得太多了  太多了
-You're sharking it. Man. You're sharking it.


748
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:59.230
谁想吸点
Who wants some?


749
01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.030
现在你知道问了
Now you ask?


750
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:03.820
-我们去哪  -恶魔礁
-Where we headed? -Devil's Reef.


751
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:06.740
听说现在有篝火派对
I hear it's firing right now.


752
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:11.040
-今晚在那冲浪  -对啊  为什么不
-We're paddling out tonight? -Yeah. Why not?


753
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.250
没有月亮  估计我们什么都看不到
-There's no moon. Bet we're not gonna see anything.


754
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:19.920
怎么  你们有夜视眼之类的吗
What. You guys have night vision or something?


755
01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:22.420
你说的是什么样的夜视眼  小子
-What kind of night vision you chatting about. Boy?


756
01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:26.090
-变得像蝙蝠一样  -电影看太多了  兄弟
-Can't you turn yourselves into bats? -Way too many movies. Bro.


757
01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.430
我们没有夜视眼  克里斯
Yeah. We don't have night vision. Chris.


758
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:34.060
蝙蝠也没有夜视眼  它们有声纳
Bats. They don't actually have night vision either. They have sonar.


759
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:35.810
你知道吗  克里斯  你对了一半
You know what? You're half right.


760
01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.770
我之前告诉过你  我们看东西的方法与人不一样
Like I told you before. We do see things differently.


761
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:41.110
尝尝这个以后
Kind of like you're about to.


762
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:48.910
你也就知道了
After you have a little taste of this.


763
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:33.120
再见  小子
Bye. Boy.


764
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:48.700
你还什么都没看到  克里斯
-You haven't seen anything yet. Chris.


765
01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.430
不会看到什么的  转变还没结束
-No. You ain't. You're not done yet.


766
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:54.010
等着看我们约的女孩在礁石上等我们吧  兄弟
Wait till you see the girls we got waiting for us at the reef. Bro.


767
01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.190
一定会很疯狂的  兄弟
It's gonna be crazy. Bro.


768
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:03.940
疯狂
Crazy.


769
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:30.720
好了  轮到我了
All right. My turn.


770
01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.180
你知不知道少管别人闲事
-Did you ever hear of getting your own thing?


771
01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:38.430
你知不知道闭上你那破嘴
Did you ever hear of shutting the hell up?


772
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.100
管好你自己吧  让开
You mind yourself. Boy. Mister. Ease off.


773
01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:42.690
好了  够了
All right. Enough.


774
01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:46.070
怎么了
What? What. What?


775
01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:47.400
麻烦给我摄像机
Camera. Please.


776
01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.740
好了  女孩们
All right. Girls.


777
01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.030
我打赌你们彼此不敢接吻
I dare you guys to kiss.


778
01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.320
给我看些我在youtube上看不到的东西
Show me something that I can't find on YouTube.


779
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:55.740
那人是你啊
That's you.


780
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:59.460
很好  继续继续
Nice.Go, go, go.


781
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.040
那个是什么  那个就是我正在说的
What's that? That's what I'm talking about.


782
01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:03.580
宝贝你有什么给我们看的
What about you, sweet thing?


783
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:06.750
-你们真的想让她那样做  -不
-You gonna let her step you up like that? -No.


784
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.460
让我们看看她给我们带来什么  你给我带来什么
What has she got? What do you got for me?


785
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:12.300
啊哈
Oh,SHE


786
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:15.800
很好  很性感  但是这些东西始终...
Oh, yes. That's sexy, but still that's something I could see...


787
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.390
...在我和我女朋友幽会的时候可以看到  所以...
...on my Girls Gone Wild box set, so...


788
01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.230
-真的不信  -真的
-Double dare? -Double dare.


789
01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.360
妈的  看见了吗  真的  快看
-Oh. Fuck. Are you seeing this? Seriously. Watch.


790
01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:31.900
我想她们敢
I think so.


791
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:37.200
-伙计们  -哦  嘿
-Guys? -Oh. Hey.


792
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:39.540
-我们要走了  -你们去哪儿
-We're out of here. -Where are you going?


793
01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.750
回我们的地方
Back to our place


794
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:43.620
-喝一杯  -我和你们一起回去
for a drink. -I'll come with you.


795
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:46.460
不  留下  克里斯  你还有好多事要干
-No. Hang back. Chris. There's plenty for you to do here.


796
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:50.460
另外  这是妮可的时刻
Besides. This is Nicole's time.


797
01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:00.720
坐下吧  哥们
Just have a seat. Man.


798
01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:04.060
好样的
Attaboy.


799
01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.500
看看这个
So check this out.


800
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:27.670
你知道盐水和血基本上是一种东西吗
Do you know that salt water and blood are basically the same thing?


801
01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.550
真的
It's true.


802
01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:32.920
法国生物学家在狗身上做了实验
There's a French biologist that did this experiment on a stray dog


803
01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:35.010
大概是在世纪之交的时候
around the turn of the century.


804
01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:39.180
他放干了狗的血  并用盐水替代
He drained all the blood out of the dog and replaced it with diluted seawater


805
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:43.020
所有人都以为狗死定了
and everybody thought that this dog was gonna die.


806
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.310
但它没有
Except the dog didn't.


807
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.520
失去的血再生了
What they found is that all the missing blood had regenerated.


808
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:52.190
盐水变成了血
The saltwater became blood.


809
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.660
此后  这条狗比以前更加活跃  精力旺盛
And after that. The dog was more alive and vibrant than it ever had been before.


810
01:11:58.910 --> 01:12:03.370
这条狗很健康地活了很久
The dog went on to live a long and very healthy life.


811
01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.210
敬长寿  克里斯
To long life. Chris.


812
01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:27.560
我也试试这个
Let me try some of that.


813
01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.570
我觉得你肯定不会喜欢的
-I don't really think you'd find it too much to your liking.


814
01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:34.190
还是喝你的啤酒吧
You might wanna just stick with the beer.


815
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:43.240
你这个又长又无聊的故事想说明什么
So what exactly was the point of your very long and boring story. Jon?


816
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:45.410
基本上  他想说的就是
Basically. What he's trying to say is


817
01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:47.370
我们是吸血鬼
we're vampires.


818
01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.630
-好可怕  -不  但事实上
-Ooh. Scary. -No. But seriously


819
01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:55.670
我们就是吸血鬼
we're vampires.


820
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:04.180
救命
Help me!


821
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:07.770
不  不  不
No. No. No.


822
01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.520
不要  求求你
No. Please.


823
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:20.610
放我走吧
Let me go.


824
01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:22.370
闭上你的臭嘴
Shut the fuck up.


825
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:26.250
不  不  不
No. No. No.


826
01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:32.960
我太喜欢这女孩了  妈的  太喜欢了
I'm thinking I love this girl. Oh. Fuck. I love this girl.


827
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.800
吃啊
Do it.


828
01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:43.720
吃啊
Do it!


829
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.930
跑啊  快点
Run. Go.


830
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.600
快点
Come on.


831
01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.670
你完蛋了  兄弟
You're fucked up. Bro.


832
01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.670
肖恩不会在这救你  我受够你了
Shane's not around to save your ass and I've had it with your attitude.


833
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:32.020
你以为我是在开玩笑么
Guess you think I'm kidding you. Bud


834
01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:34.860
但我没开玩笑
but it ain't so.


835
01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:38.780
肖恩现在在哪儿  混蛋
Where's Shane now. Bi? Fuck.


836
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:14.060
现在没棍子了  是吧
You ain't got no fucking stick now. Do you?


837
01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:17.060
快点  结束这一切吧
Come on. Let's finish this.


838
01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:18.900
嘿
Hey!


839
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:21.740
谁订了十字架
Who ordered the stake?


840
01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.450
你能控制住自己吗
Are you cool?


841
01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:28.910
是的  我能
Yeah. I'm cool.


842
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:32.410
你能吗
I said. Are you cool?


843
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.910
让我看看你的牙
Show me your teeth.


844
01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.750
我说了  我能
I said I'm cool.


845
01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.750
我说了  让我看看你的牙
And I said. Show me your teeth.


846
01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:43.670
我能控制住
I am cool.


847
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:47.090
没错  看得出来
Yeah. I can see that.


848
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:49.970
没时间纠缠这些破事了  艾迪
We don't have time for this shit. Eddie.


849
01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:53.390
咱们得赶回老巢  在我妹妹吸血之前救她出来
We have to get to the nest and get my sister before she feeds.


850
01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:58.230
我也正想这么说
That's what I'm talking about.


851
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:02.860
我讨厌他妈的吸血鬼
I hate fucking vampires.


852
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:15.710
你在干什么
What are you doing. Man?


853
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:17.830
变圣水
Turning this into holy water.


854
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.380
-我是牧师  -你是牧师
-I'm a minister. -You're a minister?


855
01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.340
对  我是在网上被任命的
Yup. I got ordained online.


856
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:26.380
我被国际在线牧师协会认证
I'm officially recognized by the International Association of Online Ministers


857
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:30.760
为尊敬的埃德加·弗洛格牧师  吸血鬼猎人
as the Honorable Reverend Edgar Frog. The vampire hunter.


858
01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:32.390
你受过训练
Did you study for that?


859
01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:35.430
没有  我在网上填了几张表
No. I went to the website. Filled out a couple forms


860
01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.890
然后点击了"任命我"
and clicked "Ordain Me."


861
01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:41.440
在战斗开始前  有几件事你得知道
Now. Before going into battle. There's a few things that you need to be briefed on.


862
01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:45.070
首先  吸血鬼死的样子不好看
First of all. When a vampire buys it. It's never a pretty sight.


863
01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:47.280
没有死法一样的吸血鬼
No two bloodsuckers go out the same way.


864
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:50.570
有些大喊大叫  有些一声不吭  有些爆炸  有些内爆
Some yell and scream. Some go quietly. Some explode. Some implode


865
01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.830
但他们全想拉你垫背
but all will try to take you with them.


866
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:55.330
至于猎鬼武器
As far as your arsenal of vamp artillery:


867
01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.620
我们有十字架
We got stakes.


868
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:59.500
有木头的  有金属的
Got some wooden ones. Got some metal ones


869
01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.540
还有碳纤维的
and some carbon-fibers.


870
01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:04.130
我喜欢树脂的  又轻又好用
I like the resins. They're light and easy to handle.


871
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.760
老东西就是好  经典木制
That said. There's nothing as good as the old-fashioned. Classic wood job.


872
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.180
安全  结实  可靠
Safe. Sturdy. Reliable.


873
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.680
我们有空气推动榴弹发射器  用以发射圣水球
Next. We have my air-propelled-rocket grenade launcher for holy-water balloons.


874
01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:16.680
这是我的玩意  你别碰它
This is my baby. Don't touch it.


875
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:18.810
我们还有一个这东西
We also have one of these.


876
01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:21.440
-你知道怎么用吧  -是的  当然
-You know how to use this. Right? -Yeah. Totally.


877
01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:24.570
-好的  -不  伙计  我不知道这是什么
-Okay. Good. -No. Dude. I have no idea what that is.


878
01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:26.030
这是大蒜腊肠
It's a garlic bolo.


879
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.780
别管了  还是我拿这个吧
Never mind. I'll hold on to this one.


880
01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:34.370
咱们去杀几个吸血鬼
Let's go kill some vampires.


881
01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:01.020
他们知道我们在这
They know we're here.


882
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.380
准备好了吗
Are you ready?


883
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:33.680
-我想是的  -你想是的
-I guess so. -You guess so?


884
01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:38.930
我确定
I know so.


885
01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.360
救救我
Help me.


886
01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.530
救救我
Help me.


887
01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:06.880
闻到了吗
You smell that?


888
01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:12.510
真菌与死亡的气息
Smells like fungus or death.


889
01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.800
吸血鬼的味道
It's vampire BO.


890
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.960
什么
What?


891
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:56.930
-你到底在说什么  -跟着我就行了
-What the hell are you talking about? -Just follow me.

妮可  救救我
Nicole. Help me.


893

894
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:21.700
我不能
I can't.


895
01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.370
但你说已经准备好了
You said you were ready.


896
01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.000
但我认识他
But I know him.


897
01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.960
他是横亘在我们之间唯一的障碍  妮可
Well. He's the only thing that still stands between us. Nicole.


898
01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:34.670
横亘在你与不朽之间的唯一障碍
The only thing that stands between you and immortality.


899
01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.430
如果你想和我在一起
If you wanna be with me


900
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:38.840
如果你爱我
if you love me


901
01:20:39.010 --> 01:20:41.050
就吸了他的血
you'll do this.


902
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.330
安静  你会惊醒死人了
Quiet. Man. You'll wake the dead.


903
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.920

906
01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:19.930
妈的
Shit.


907
01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:23.260
说好一起行动的  怎么不听呢
What part of "stay together" don't you understand?


908
01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:43.840
有不对劲的味道
I smell ugly.


909
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:02.200
克里斯
Chris.


910
01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.280

克里斯不在这儿  艾迪

912
01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.790
你弟弟在

913
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:11.870
你在哪
Where are you?


914
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:20.300
的确恶心
Yup. It's ugly.


915
01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:23.720
失手
Missed.


916
01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.520
