1
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.790
I mean, for years,

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.430
men have thought that
they were smarter than women.


3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.430
Women in universities
in the U.K.


4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.990
do better than men in nearly
every area of performance.


5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.390
That's according
to new research.


6
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.910
For years, men have thought

7
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.150
that women should not work.

8
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.710
And that was 2009,
when women became


9
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.350
more than 50% of the workforce.

10
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.830
And for years,

11
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.910
men have thought
that women couldn't lead.


12
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.510
[woman] And last year,
for the first time,


13
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.710
women became 54% of all
American managers.


14
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.430
For years, men have thought

15
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.990
that women could not fight.

16
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.030
The Senate just voted on a bill
that would have women


17
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.430
be eligible to be drafted
into the US military


18
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.750
for the first time
in American history.


19
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.910
And Kinsey mentioned
that for years,


20
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.990
men have thought that women
had a lower sex drive.


21
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.830
Women in the past were sexually

22
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.950
very different
than women of today.


23
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.150
But now there's a cable channel

24
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.910
that just shows porn for women.

25
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.110
The female orgasm can be

26
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
10 times more powerful
than the male orgasm.


27
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.950
Women have a wider range
of arousal than men.


28
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.190
I think sexuality is more part
of a woman's identity.


29
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.150
If women were raised

30
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.150
to think of themselves
as sexual creatures,


31
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.270
you would probably see
a very different world.


32
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.470
[female narrator]
Growing up, I never realized


33
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.550
that I had a high sex drive.

34
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.950
Not until I discovered
that sex seemed to feel


35
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.990
more special to me.

36
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.150
It's not that the guys I dated
didn't think it was special.


37
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.390
It's just that, for me,
it felt richer, deeper.


38
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.710
It was more satisfying.

39
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.710
It's like we were doing
the same thing,


40
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.670
but I had a totally
different experience.


41
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.030
Am I the only woman
who feels this way?


42
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.990
Or are there more women
who feel like me?


43
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.230
It depends.
If-If-If the man


44
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.910
is in love with his woman,

45
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.950
he will feel love
with emotions.


46
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.430
But if he, you know,
it's like one-night stand,


47
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.150
he just-- he just, uh,

48
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.070
fulfills his pleasure.

49
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.710
That's it.

50
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.990
And I think for a woman,

51
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.270
there's always such amount
of emotions.


52
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.590
I think for a woman,
it's more important.


53
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.030
I think for the man, because
of his... it bolsters his ego.


54
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.190
Yes, for a woman, because
we have more sexual energy.


55
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.150
I think it's about the same.

56
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.430
Oh, there are differences,
but...


57
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.710
Yes, I definitely think that
women have a higher sex drive,


58
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.510
because, for us
it's more sensual,
and it just feels deeper.


59
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.590
I have to say women

60
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.950
because they crave affection,

61
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.110
and guys, they just...

62
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.070
For men,
it's more important


63
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.830
to have lots of sex
with different people.


64
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.670
They both like it,
but men want it more often.


65
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.110
For women,
it's important to make this


66
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.310
one act of sex they do

67
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.750
an important thing.

68
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.350
There's apparently a shortage
of possible romantic partners.


69
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.630
Complaints of a man drought...

70
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.310
The search for love
is in a state of emergency.


71
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.790
What's keeping them from
finding their Prince Charming?


72
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.310
People don't want to admit
what the reality is.


73
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.070
Professional black women
are not making it up.


74
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.990
Australia is caught up
in a man drought.


75
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.110
Finding the right man
is proving elusive.


76
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.710
It's not easy out there.
There's definitely
a man drought.


77
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.470
I'm feeling it. It's hard
to find a date, even.


78
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.510
Look, if you're a woman,
and you've been wondering


79
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.510
where all the men have gone,

80
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.510
the good news is that
it's not in your head,


81
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.750
but the bad news is that
you're actually right.


82
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.230
There is a massive
shortage of men.


83
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.590
Millions of women know
just what it feels like


84
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.390
to look around
at the men on offer


85
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.390
and think, "No, thanks."

86
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.950
Okay, delay, delay, delay,
as much as you possibly can,


87
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.390
until you know that
you've met someone


88
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.190
that you can be happy with
for the rest of your life.


89
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.310
Growing up with
romantic comedies,


90
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.430
you do tend to think
that life should be like
a Reese Witherspoon movie,


91
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.190
that you should be swept
off your feet.


92
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.190
Some successful women

93
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.670
have had good men
and didn't know it.


94
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.270
[narrator]
Men and women have always had
different opinions about sex,


95
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.110
but according to dating
experts, there has never been


96
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.150
such a major
shift in relationships
than in the last 15 years.


97
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.270
Today I am meeting one of those
dating experts,


98
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.590
Marcia Chong.

99
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.790
In her work,
she talks about


100
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.910
how modern gender roles
have completely changed
the dating game,


101
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.790
and how years of experience
have led her


102
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.510
to an interesting conclusion.

103
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.190
She believes that sex
is more important for women,


104
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.670
and today
I want to find out why.


105
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.990
When it comes to sex
and attraction,


106
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.870
every woman has a secret
that we never share with men,


107
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.470
because if we did, things might
get a little awkward.


108
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.470
You see,
every woman has a list,


109
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.590
a list of all the things
we want in a man.


110
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.910
Now, the problem
is not the list.


111
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.390
The problem is
the size of the list


112
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.630
and the fact that
it is that detailed.


113
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.750
For example,
he has to be tall, handsome,


114
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.590
strong,
educated and ambitious,


115
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.430
have a good job,
have a nice house, a car,


116
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.350
and he has to be social
and fit in with our family.


117
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.790
And of course,
he has to be a good kisser,


118
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.430
a good lover, and a great
father for our children.


119
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.510
But, unfortunately,

120
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.230
only a few men can meet
those high expectations,


121
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.150
and that's why many men
think that women
aren't interested in sex.


122
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.870
But we are.
It's just that


123
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.430
most men don't make the list.

124
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.150
And we call this
the 80/20 principle.


125
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.550
-The 80/20 principle?
-Yes.


126
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.910
It's a marketing principle
that's also used in
the dating world,


127
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.150
and it means that

128
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.630
are only interested
in 20% of the men.


129
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.190
For example, dating profiles.

130
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.070
While men like roughly half
of the women on the site,


131
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.150
most women only like

132
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.710
And this is why women are so
competitive in the dating world,


133
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.230
and I think
even more than men.


134
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.470
Because most women
are interested
in a very small group of men.


135
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.230
But it's getting worse.

136
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.670
Dating for women is becoming
harder and harder.


137
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.990
-What do you mean?
-For the first time in history,


138
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.430
women are out-performing men
in nearly every category.


139
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.350
More women are graduating,

140
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.030
becoming doctors,
lawyers, bankers,


141
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.910
and all these changes
are dramatically transforming
the dating culture.


142
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.710
Because these days, women are
not dependent on men anymore.


143
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.710
We have our own careers,
our own houses, social lives,


144
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.670
and we can provide
for ourselves.


145
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.750
So now women only settle
with the best.


146
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.830
A man has to have
added value.


147
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.510
And if a man has lower education
or earns less,


148
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.110
he might be
less interesting to women.


149
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.590
So as our status increases,

150
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.710
so do our expectations,

151
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.310
and our lists become
longer and longer.


152
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.270
[Chong] Yes, that's right.
And this also impacts men.


153
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.830
It makes men frustrated
and confused,


154
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.950
because less and less women
find them interesting.


155
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.630
You see, in the past,
almost everyone got married,


156
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.190
because it was seen
as a necessity.


157
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.510
And a good provider
had a good chance
of getting married.


158
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.470
But now,
that guarantee is gone.


159
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.470
And another thing is
that women these days


160
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.910
want a soul mate to talk about
feelings with a man.


161
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.590
But at the same time,
he has to be firm and rugged.


162
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.830
And this is also confusing men.

163
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.390
[interviewer] But why are
our expectations so high?


164
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.030
I think this has to do
with biology.


165
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.030
A man can produce millions
of sperm cells every day,


166
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.030
but a woman
can only get pregnant
a few times in her life.


167
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.350
So she wants
the best husband,


168
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.070
father and provider
for her child,


169
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.590
or else she could end up
raising her child alone.


170
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.630
It's like a handgun
versus a machine gun.


171
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.110
If you had a handgun
with only six bullets,


172
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.230
wouldn't you be very selective
in how you use it?


173
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.870
Yeah, I guess I would be
very selective.


174
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.310
But I recently read a study

175
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.550
that showed that women cheat
as much as men.


176
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.470
Do you think this is true?

177
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.070
Yes. Most people think
that men cheat more.


178
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.430
But in reality,
that's not true.


179
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.950
Because all these men don't just
cheat with single women.


180
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.430
But I think there's one
major difference--


181
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.590
women are better
at keeping it a secret.


182
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.390
Are you saying
we're better at cheating?


183
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.270
In my experience,
men are more obvious


184
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.190
and women are more subtle.

185
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.110
But for a woman,
it's more important to know


186
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.910
if their partner is cheating.

187
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.910
Woman worry about it more,

188
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.670
and that's why a lot of women
need more validation.


189
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.670
When she asks,
"Do you love me?"


190
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.830
or "How much do you love me?"

191
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.150
these aren't random questions,
they actually go back
to evolution.


192
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.550
Because when a woman
becomes pregnant,


193
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.950
she's very dependent
and vulnerable.


194
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.190
So if her partner leaves her
while she's pregnant,
she has a big problem.


195
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.350
Men, on the other hand,
do not experience


196
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.350
that level of vulnerability.

197
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.390
So who do you think has
a higher sex drive?


198
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.830
-Men or women?
-I think women do


199
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.190
because we check out men
all the time.


200
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.230
So women think about sex
more than men,


201
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.550
but in a different way,
a more critical way.


202
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.790
Because we have to make sure
we choose the right man,


203
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.990
we're constantly comparing
and analyzing men.


204
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.270
Is he attractive, intelligent,
and does he have potential?


205
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.030
I even have to admit that

206
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.430
I still catch myself
doing it all the time,


207
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.030
and I'm happily married.

208
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.310
Two birth-control pills
have suspected links


209
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.830
to the deaths of at least

210
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.870
[female broadcaster]
More than 1,000 Canadian women


211
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.190
have had gall bladders removed,
strokes,


212
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.830
or are on blood thinners
for the rest of their lives.


213
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.990
They are. They really are.
They are totally messing up


214
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.870
women's natural hormone rhythm.

215
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.430
It's a very, very potent drug,
and it has life-ending
properties to it.


216
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.630
[female broadcaster]
Makers of the two pills
have already paid


217
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.430
more than a billion dollars,
settling thousands of lawsuits.


218
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.230
[female broadcaster 2]
A possible link between
birth control and depression.


219
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.630
Those who use birth-control
pills were twenty three
to two times more likely


220
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.750
to be prescribed
an antidepressant medication


221
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.830
compared to those
who didn't used them.


222
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.990
And you have these mood swings.
Some women can have
suicidal thoughts,


223
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.670
some women can just go
from being extremely happy
to extremely sad.


224
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.310
And so at first
it was assumed that,


225
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.510
okay, well, you're putting
synthetic hormones
into your body


226
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.510
and you're body's just trying
to get used to it,


227
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.470
so those mood swings are normal,

228
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.990
and they'll normalize
as you continue usage.


229
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.590
But it's actually having
an impact on certain regions
of your brain.


230
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.550
[woman] Taking birth control
may be affecting


231
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.870
how women perceive men's
level of attractiveness.


232
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.270
When you expose males

233
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.470
to excess estrogen,

234
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.750
that feminizes males.

235
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.870
When you expose females

236
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.150
to excess estrogen,

237
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.270
it masculinizes females.

238
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.670
The increased risk of
breast cancer and heart disease,


239
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.350
and those are
very concerning, but...


240
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.310
I think for me, the thing
that was most personally
concerning was,


241
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.910
I lost my sex drive.

242
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.950
[narrator] Since I was 15,
I've been on the pill.


243
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.830
It always made me feel
safe and protected.


244
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.310
But recently, more people have
started to reject the pill,


245
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.590
and this made me ask myself,

246
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.070
"Am I still making
the right decision?"


247
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.310
To answer these questions,
I've decided to arrange


248
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.630
a meeting with a specialist
in chemistry


249
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.950
and ask her what
they're putting in our pill.


250
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.070
I've heard many stories
about the Pill,


251
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.670
but does it really
decrease our sex drive?


252
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.150
[woman] Yes.
Studies show that a lot


253
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.390
of birth-control pills actually
lower the sex drive.


254
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.750
In fact, the pill works
by tricking the body


255
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.590
into thinking it's pregnant.

256
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.870
But the problem is that when
the body thinks it's pregnant,


257
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.470
it stops producing
the hormone testosterone.


258
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.070
[interviewer]
You mean the hormone
that affects the sex drive?


259
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.030
Yes. Testosterone makes
a woman take more risks,


260
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.430
become wilder,
put herself out there.


261
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.110
So, the less testosterone
a woman has,


262
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.310
the lower her sex drive.

263
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.870
But sometimes the pill
also increases the sex drive.


264
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.110
Not all birth control
contain the same hormones.


265
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.070
But unfortunately, most women
who are on the pill


266
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.190
report a decrease
in sex drive.


267
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.790
-So do you take the pill?
-No, I don't.


268
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.670
You see, the pill not only
affects the sex drive,


269
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.910
but it also changes
the structure of your brain.


270
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.790
It impacts our sense of smell.

271
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.030
It even impacts especially

272
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.270
how attractive we find men.

273
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.030
For example,
women who meet their partner
while they're on the pill


274
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.550
may find them less attractive
once they stop taking the pill.


275
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.030
-How is that possible?
-Remember,


276
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.230
when you're on the pill,
your body thinks


277
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.470
that it's pregnant,
and it's thinking,


278
00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.630
"How can I get
a good male provider


279
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.030
to take care of my baby?"

280
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.390
Physical appearance
is less important.


281
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.830
But once you're off the pill,
your brain is thinking,


282
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.150
"How can I get
a handsome man


283
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.830
to fertilize me and give me
an attractive baby?"


284
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.950
And this problem might be

285
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.790
even bigger than we think.

286
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.350
Since the 1960s, the average
British breast size


287
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.390
has increased
by three cup sizes.


288
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.350
At first, experts thought

289
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.590
it was only due
to weight gain.


290
00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.510
But many British women

291
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.110
have maintained
their body proportions,


292
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.790
leading experts to believe

293
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.750
a more disturbing theory...

294
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.910
the increased British
breast size was due


295
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.230
to the unnaturally high
estrogen levels


296
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.110
that are mainly found
in the pill.


297
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.310
[interviewer] Aside from
the pill, do you think women


298
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:04.870
naturally have a higher
sex drive than men?


299
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.630
In my professional
opinion, no.


300
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.190
Here's the problem--

301
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.350
The female sex drive
is more in the mind,


302
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.710
and the male sex drive
is more in the body.


303
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.710
So it's easy
to measure the body,


304
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.830
but it's very difficult

305
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.990
to measure what's going on
in the mind,


306
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.150
to measure what women
are really thinking.


307
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.790
So women can have
a higher sex drive.


308
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.830
Personally speaking,

309
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.950
I think yes, woman have
a higher sex drive.


310
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.350
But the problem is,
we don't get to show it.


311
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.590
-What do you mean exactly?
-I think it has to do


312
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.230
with the way in which
women are raised.


313
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.310
Most guys have been taught

314
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.510
to go out there
and "macho"


315
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.230
and have as much fun
as possible.


316
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:53.150
But most girls have been taught
to be modest.


317
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.430
That's why their sex drive
is more internal.


318
00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:00.350
And sometimes women don't even
know when they are aroused.


319
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.110
If a man is aroused,
he immediately


320
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.750
feels an erection down there.

321
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.430
But when a woman is aroused,

322
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.710
she doesn't have any way
of knowing it.


323
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.390
She uses her intuition.

324
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.310
It's much more often
emotional feeling.


325
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.630
-So our sex drives
are more tricky then.
-Yes.


326
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.750
Have a look at this.

327
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.310
This is a Maasai couple.
Can you tell me,


328
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.750
who is the woman
in this picture?


329
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.950
-I think it's
the one on the left.
-No.


330
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.590
The one with the long hair
and the jewelry is the man.


331
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.830
Many people think that

332
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:39.630
women are less visual
than men.


333
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.390
But it's absolutely not true.

334
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.590
In fact,
it's the exact opposite.


335
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.270
Women are more visual
than men.


336
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.790
In the West,
we actually have


337
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.270
the beauty standard backwards.

338
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.910
Originally, it's men who are
supposed to be beautiful.


339
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.790
Think about the peacock
and its feathers,


340
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.750
or the lion and its mane,

341
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.430
or even ducks.

342
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.670
It's the males
who are beautiful,


343
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.470
not the females.

344
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.510
In fact, when researchers

345
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.710
began to study
female desire,


346
00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.790
they were shocked.

347
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.670
Not only did they discover
that women


348
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.510
were just as aroused as men
when watching porn,


349
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.310
they also discovered
that women had


350
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.430
a wider range of arousal
than men.


351
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.510
Even non-human sex

352
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.990
aroused women.

353
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.150
Like millions of people
across the globe,


354
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:39.310
my husband and I
are outraged and heartbroken


355
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.830
over the kidnapping
of more than 200 Nigerian girls


356
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.590
from their school dormitory
in the middle of the night.


357
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.670
[woman] From the beginning,
the Pakistan Taliban


358
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.510
took credit for shooting
Malala Yousafzai


359
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:53.870
because she spoke out
against the Taliban


360
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.550
and their restrictions
on education for girls.


361
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.390
Fourteen Pakistani
village council members
have been arrested


362
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.310
for allegedly ordering
a teenage girl to be raped.


363
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.750
[man] Crimes against women
in India have doubled
in the last decade,


364
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.750
sparking worldwide
condemnations.


365
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.230
In India, a rape case
is reported every 20 minutes.


366
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.870
[woman] A 23-year-old student
gang-raped


367
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.350
inside a moving bus
in the nation's capital.


368
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.190
Sexually assaulted
with an iron rod,


369
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.550
her internal organs
pulled out.


370
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.790
The injuries so brutal,
she later died.


371
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.550
The very term
"honor killing"


372
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:28.630
has a sinister
but misleading ring to it.


373
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.110
The murder of a woman or child
by a father, brother or uncle


374
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.430
for bringing perceived shame
on the family.


375
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.550
[woman] In Egypt,
official reports have shown


376
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.230
that sexual violence
against women has increased.


377
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.270
99.3% of Egyptian woman

378
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.470
have experienced some form
of sexual violence.


379
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.510
Saudi Arabia is
the most conservative
country in the world,


380
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.710
where women are still
banned from driving


381
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.350
and need permission
from their male guardian,


382
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.390
being a father, a husband
or a son, to simply get a job.


383
00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.390
[woman] Just a few weeks ago,
she quietly married the love
of her life


384
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.950
against the wishes
of her family.


385
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.750
The day after the marriage,
Sabbah's father and uncle


386
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.430
took her from her new home
and tried to kill her.


387
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.430
[narrator] From a young age,
I have been told that women


388
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.910
have always had
little rights in history


389
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.990
and that we're now living
in the golden age of women.


390
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.510
But what if that isn't true?
Today we're meeting


391
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.510
with Dr. Annine van der Meer.

392
00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:26.230
Annine is a historian,
theologian, and gender expert.


393
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.830
She has written several books
and articles that contradict


394
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.550
many things that we are told
about women today


395
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:36.110
and reveal the hidden role
of women in history.


396
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.150
What was the role
of women in history,


397
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.430
and was it very different
from today?


398
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.950
Yes. It was very different.

399
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.150
Because before "his story,"

400
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.270
we had "her story."

401
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.750
And that was a very different
cultural period.


402
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.950
There was a lot
of sexual freedom


403
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.390
in that period of history.

404
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.230
There was peace and harmony.

405
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.310
So the idea that man
is primitive and aggressive


406
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.750
in his essence is wrong.

407
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.990
But that changed.

408
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.950
That changed by an enormous
climate crisis


409
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.870
around 3000 BC.

410
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.110
Many ice ages
dried up the earth


411
00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.510
and made the word very cold
so that people couldn't


412
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.310
work and live
on the land anymore.


413
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.310
And because the men
had to leave their land,


414
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.390
they took the horses
and the herds,


415
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.390
and they became nomads.

416
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.230
Thus they had
to conquer land


417
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.590
of other people
to live on,


418
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:49.870
and they brought
a male-dominated society


419
00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.350
which was very suppressive
for women.


420
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.830
So how were women sexually?

421
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.470
Women in the past
were sexually


422
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.190
very different
than women of today.


423
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.870
First of all,
they were free


424
00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.950
to choose their partners,

425
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:13.070
and they loved sex
and eroticism.


426
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.190
And having a baby

427
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:19.230
was something very precious
because there were few people.


428
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.430
And afterwards,
when people settled down
in settlements and cities,


429
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.190
the women also stayed
very free


430
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.950
and could choose
their partners,


431
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.190
so sexuality was really
something


432
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:36.630
which was bigger than
a biological, medical thing.


433
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.550
It was an emotional,
psychological


434
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.430
and spiritual thing.

435
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.110
Let me ask you a question.

436
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:49.510
Which is the oldest profession
in the world,


437
00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.790
do you think?

438
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.070
I guess prostitution, maybe.

439
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.950
In history,
it's prostitution.


440
00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.830
but in "her story,"
it's midwifery.


441
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.230
The midwife helping
the pregnant woman


442
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.230
to deliver the baby,

443
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.270
using herbs
to relax the muscles.


444
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.510
She has a lot
of herbal knowledge.


445
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.910
She knows a lot
about birth control.


446
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.310
That's why they had
so much sexual freedom.


447
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.790
They could choose
their male partners.


448
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.790
They were not afraid
to have babies.


449
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.150
They could experiment
with them


450
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.950
before they choose a final
partner to have babies with.


451
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.150
Wow!
When I think of midwives,


452
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.870
I only think about giving birth,
not preventing it.


453
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.470
Women in the past
knew much more about


454
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.950
anti-conception
than women today.


455
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:43.470
-Seriously?
-Yes.


456
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.150
Many people think that
sexual revolution started


457
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.390
with introducing the pill
in the '60s,


458
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.750
but this anti-conception
knowledge


459
00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.870
was much older,
millennia older.


460
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.590
It gave the women
a lot of freedom.


461
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.910
But then this knowledge
was lost.


462
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.110
At the end of the Middle Ages
in Europe,


463
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:08.790
there became
a serious illness, a plague,


464
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.070
and the population
was decimated.


465
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.910
Many villages and lands
were empty,


466
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:18.190
and then Church
and State thought,


467
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.670
"We have to repopulate."

468
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.630
And then they thought,
"Well, who do we know


469
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.030
who manages fertility

470
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.870
and who controls fertility?"

471
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:33.670
That was the midwife.
And they thought,


472
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.870
"Well, let's remove them.

473
00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.590
Let's call them witches."

474
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:43.150
The literal meaning of the word
"witch" is wiccan,
is "to know."


475
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.950
[interviewer] I always
thought that "witch"
was a negative word,


476
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.470
-but it's actually
about knowledge.
-Yes.


477
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.110
Midwives had
this ancient knowledge


478
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.710
about managing fertility,

479
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.710
about reducing fertility,

480
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.870
and enhancing fertility.

481
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.550
So these wise women

482
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.630
were accused of witchery.

483
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.990
And a witch hunt started,

484
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.910
and it spread itself
all over Europe.


485
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:16.310
There were so many countries,
and many, many, many women
were murdered.


486
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:21.150
To accuse midwives
of magical acts


487
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.630
and copulating with the devil

488
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:29.350
was all about fertility
and sexual acts.


489
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.950
So we had a high sex drive,
but then the Church
took it away?


490
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:37.190
[Annine] Yes.
We in Western cultures


491
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:41.150
have a long, long
and very tragic history


492
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.070
of sexual repression--

493
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.150
repression of the libido,

494
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.590
repression of body awareness.

495
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.710
Sex was perverse.

496
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.870
Sex was vulgar.

497
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.110
And we have this split

498
00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.670
between sexuality
and religion.


499
00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.950
Where is that freedom
we had?


500
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.150
We once had? It's gone.

501
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.150
For example,
look at Egypt now.


502
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.670
So many women
totally covered up


503
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.670
from top to toe.

504
00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.070
Even the hands,

505
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.350
in 40 degrees of warmth--
it's terrible.


506
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.590
But how different
it once was.


507
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.790
They could own land,

508
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.350
they could travel,

509
00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:31.030
they could go to the market
and exchange goods.


510
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.790
Everything was possible.
They could choose
their own husbands.


511
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.270
They could marry
whoever they liked.


512
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:41.070
[interviewer] So our sex drive
was more respected.


513
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.630
-Very much respected.
-Okay.


514
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.710
So the last question--

515
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.710
Do you think women have

516
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.190
a higher sex drive
than men?


517
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.670
Historically
speaking, yes.


518
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.750
Because in these ancient
groups of people,


519
00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.590
it was so important
that people got babies


520
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.790
and that the group
was enlarged.


521
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.350
Women were eager
to have sex.


522
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.030
They were honored
for that quality.


523
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.910
When there was this
physical attraction


524
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.550
and psychological
attraction,


525
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.790
to really feel
love and affection
for their male partners,


526
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.670
she really could
reach ecstasy,


527
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:27.230
and she could take him with her
in that ecstasy.


528
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:31.350
And I'm convinced
we had that ability,


529
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.030
and we still have that today.

530
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.790
There is an element
of hatred and rejection


531
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.150
in men's relationships
to women


532
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:44.830
which women are unfortunately
unaware of at their peril.


533
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:46.790
So I don't know
what sex is for.


534
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.590
I do know how sex
is used against women.


535
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.270
The act of fucking
being to the advantage


536
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:56.270
of the one who fucks
and to the disadvantage
of the one who is fucked


537
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.350
is always characterized
as female and inferior.


538
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.990
-[man] What do you
think men are doing wrong?
-They oppress us as women.


539
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.030
They won't let us be.

540
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.350
Pornography, essentially,
is the trafficking in women.


541
00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.350
It's the sale of women.

542
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.830
It is a system
of sexual exploitation


543
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.070
in which women are devalued,

544
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.070
women are turned
into commodities,


545
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:21.110
women are sold as meat,
women are, in fact, tortured.


546
00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.870
Five years ago,
we said to rape victims,


547
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.750
"Oh, you enjoyed
it, you wanted it,
you asked for it."


548
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.830
And now we are saying
the same things to women


549
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.230
who are forced into prostitution
or into pornography.


550
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.390
Most people in the States
or probably even here


551
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:37.550
don't really know
what does go on


552
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.950
in pornography,

553
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.110
and I felt it very important

554
00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.430
to take a stand and, uh,

555
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.150
let people know that pornography
is not a victimless crime


556
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:49.630
and to speak up
and set the record straight


557
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.470
as to what happened to me.

558
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.430
[narrator] Before the height
of the feminist movement,


559
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.190
mainstream porn was seen
as something that


560
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.390
men and women
watched together.


561
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.870
Both men and women
flocked to the screenings


562
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.950
to see films like Deep Throat,
Behind the Green Door,


563
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.190
and The Devil Inside
Miss Jones.


564
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.430
But during
the feminist movement,


565
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.910
porn became divided.

566
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.670
Porn was now seen
as masculine, aggressive.


567
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.550
So a new type of porn
had to be created,


568
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.950
a type of porn that suited
the modern woman.


569
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.150
But instead of becoming
less explicit,


570
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.070
the porn that women had in mind
was even more explicit


571
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.590
and would go beyond Playboy
and show everything.


572
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.230
This was the rise
of a new era,


573
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.550
and it was called Playgirl.

574
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.550
[interviewer] As the former
editor-in-chief,


575
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:40.870
what was it like
working at Playgirl?


576
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:44.550
It's definitely strange
and a little surreal.


577
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.590
I did not grow up

578
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:51.230
feeling like I was doing
a lot of the looking.


579
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.590
Certainly I'd always found
men attractive,


580
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.590
but I had literally never
been standing around


581
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.590
just looking at
naked men before.


582
00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.030
So it was certainly strange,

583
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.950
but after a while, it all just
becomes very normalized.


584
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:07.870
And, of course,
dealing with, um,


585
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.510
"mimbos" makes it
get old really fast.


586
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.910
-"Mimbos"?
-I think of mimbos


587
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.230
as basically just
the male version of bimbos.


588
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.670
Guys who are
just solely focused


589
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.270
on what they look like
and how they're appearing.


590
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.910
How fake their spray tan
does or doesn't look.


591
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.710
How white their teeth are.

592
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.830
Whether they shaved their chest
hair and if there's stubble.


593
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.030
Really just un-sexy details

594
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.350
that, um...

595
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.830
you know, just kind of take away
all of, like,


596
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.670
the sex appeal when you're
the person behind the camera.


597
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.870
[interviewer] So there was
a double standard.


598
00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.030
Yeah, there's a pretty big
double standard.


599
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.150
If a woman poses for Playboy,
it can help to launch
her career.


600
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:51.350
If a guy poses for Playgirl,
he can end up getting fired
or he's seen as cheap


601
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.670
or there's a stigma against it
in some other way.


602
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:57.430
Wow. How did you end up
working for Playgirl?


603
00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.630
Um... funny story.

604
00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.070
I had just finished
grad school,


605
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.870
and Craigslist had an ad for
managing editor at Playgirl.


606
00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:09.470
And I applied really
as a joke,


607
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:12.230
and when they called me in
for an interview, I was shocked.


608
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.070
But I went in. I had never seen
a Playgirl before.


609
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.070
You had never seen
a Playgirl before,


610
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.710
-but you wanted
to work at Playgirl.
-Yeah.


611
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.310
And was it hard
working at Playgirl?


612
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.710
It was challenging, for sure.

613
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.790
The magazine was run
by women,


614
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.030
owned by heterosexual men,

615
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.950
and also was trying to cater
to a gay audience.


616
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:37.070
It was very much
an impossible triangle.


617
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.310
-So you had to compromise.
-Yes.


618
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.230
There was a lot of compromise.
asking questions like,


619
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.150
"What is porn?"
"What is erotica?"
"Where is the line?"


620
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.150
What women wanted and what
men thought women wanted--


621
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.270
it was not always easy
to define.


622
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.150
Well, I know what I want.

623
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.590
Yes, but do you know what
most other women want?


624
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.270
Um, a naked,
attractive man.


625
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:59.710
Sure, but do you want him
lying in bed,


626
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.630
or do you want him
doing something?


627
00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.990
Do you want him flaccid or hard?
Do you want him
with another guy?


628
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.150
Do you want him with another
guy? Do you want him
with another woman?


629
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.910
Do you want him by himself?
In the shower? Outside?


630
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.590
It becomes very difficult
very quickly


631
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.190
to pick out something that's
going to please everybody.


632
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.310
Okay. I get
what you're saying.


633
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:18.590
Woman need a little more
than just


634
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.510
a man standing
in front of her naked.


635
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.990
Um, guys have a little bit
of an easier time


636
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.350
flipping through a Playboy
or Penthouse and seeing a woman
just standing there.


637
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.830
But a woman is more likely to
notice if there's no story line.


638
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.350
She's more likely to notice
if his makeup sucks


639
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.070
or if his spray tan is off
or if his hair is bad.


640
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:39.430
She's looking for
all of these details,


641
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.590
and so our responsibility
with Playgirl


642
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.830
was to think in those terms
and deliver.


643
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.150
Wow. How did Playgirl begin?

644
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.990
Well, you had Playboy
coming of age in the '50s,


645
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.070
and then the sexual revolution
happened in the '60s.


646
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.310
And Playgirl was started
in 1973


647
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.910
as a feminist response
to Playboy.


648
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:03.430
-I heard Jenny Lambert convinced
her husband to start Playgirl.
-Yes.


649
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:07.670
And over the years,
Playgirl had huge numbers.


650
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.470
And in its heyday, it had

651
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.830
something like 10 million
subscribers.


652
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:17.030
By the '80s, Playgirl was
getting published in more
than 32 countries.


653
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.350
It had its own TV channel,
male revue shows.


654
00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.550
It was literally everywhere.

655
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.830
Even Russia had
its own Playgirl magazine.


656
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.470
[interviewer] But then
why did Playgirl magazine stop?


657
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.630
I think ultimately

658
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.670
we couldn't get
the equation right.


659
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:37.070
I remember one day
in a conference room


660
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.110
one of my bosses turning
to me and saying,


661
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.350
completely seriously,

662
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.430
"Women do not like
to look at naked men."


663
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.710
And... I was shocked,

664
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.270
and I responded to him and said,
"But I'm a woman,


665
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.630
and I do like to look
at naked men.


666
00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.310
I'm attracted to that."

667
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:56.390
And he completely
dismissed me.


668
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.510
-Wow.
-Yes.


669
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.470
I think if they had let us do
what we wanted to,


670
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.670
what the female managers

671
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.670
at this company
were trying to do,


672
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.110
I think you would've seen a very
different future for Playgirl.


673
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.270
But Playgirl started something
very important.


674
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.510
There wasn't a name for it
back in the '70s.


675
00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.310
People were just
calling it "foreplay."


676
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.830
But Playgirl was not
about naked men.


677
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.670
Playgirl was about women
looking at naked men.


678
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.470
It was about the female gaze.

679
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.750
-You mean CFNM.
-Yes.


680
00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.390
You can look at

681
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.590
covers like this
as an example,


682
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.630
but there was
so much more interaction


683
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.790
between men and women
in the magazine


684
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.590
when it was truly
entertainment for women.


685
00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.830
You have interaction,
you have real connection,


686
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.710
you have the female gaze.

687
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.710
If you study art history at all,
the gaze and the voyeur


688
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.150
is always the man
looking in on the woman.


689
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.550
And Playgirl essentially
flipped that on its head
and said, "Fuck you."


690
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.030
That's what made it so
successful, was this idea that


691
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.950
we were empowering women
to take their sexuality


692
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.470
into their own hands
and their own eyes.


693
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.910
And that was
what was so exciting.


694
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.990
One of the most popular
requests that we would get


695
00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.710
with Playgirl
for photo shoots was


696
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.950
a man doing things like
chores around the house


697
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.310
or fixing something.

698
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:17.150
Even wearing an apron while

699
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:20.990
the woman relaxed
on a couch.


700
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.590
Essentially,
porn for women was


701
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.990
the men being in positions
of servitude.


702
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.630
But eventually we lost
that connection,


703
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.430
and things started
to disintegrate.


704
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:36.230
As we were pushed more and more
to appeal to a gay male audience


705
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:40.750
and to have less
of a direct connection
to our female readers,


706
00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.990
a lot of things just started
to get lost in translation.


707
00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.550
-Why?
-Because


708
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.670
the people at the top
were very firmly rooted


709
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:50.310
in their ideas that

710
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:52.670
women didn't want to look
at this kind of stuff.


711
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.950
And even though you saw more
porn being made for women,


712
00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.590
and you saw things like
Fifty Shades of Grey
coming out,


713
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.590
there was still this
overwhelming belief in-house


714
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.870
that women were not the ones
who would be buying
these magazines.


715
00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:08.830
-Really?
-Yes.


716
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.590
They thought that only gay men
looked at Playgirl.


717
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.750
And... that was silly

718
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.230
because the gay men
who enjoyed Playgirl


719
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.070
had always enjoyed it because
it was from a female
perspective.


720
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.630
So as soon as we started

721
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.830
erring more on the side of

722
00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:29.190
what's considered gay poses
or gay content,


723
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.270
we alienated those gay readers

724
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.030
who had enjoyed the magazine
from when it started,


725
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:37.350
but also in the process,
we alienated our female readers.


726
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:40.590
But unknowingly,
Playgirl planted a seed.


727
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:44.710
Even without the magazine
in print, CFNM is everywhere.


728
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:48.990
It's in every hot photo shoot,
it's all over the Internet,


729
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.710
it's in television,
it's in movies.


730
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.630
It has become sort
of the gold standard


731
00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:57.950
in what women generally see
as erotic.


732
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:01.070
By the way,
who invented the word? You?


733
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:04.590
-No, it was Brad.
-Brad? A guy?


734
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.150
-Yes.
-Okay.


735
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.950
So who do you think has
a higher sex drive?


736
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.510
I would say it's equal,

737
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.750
but I can say that
if women were raised


738
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.110
to think of themselves
as sexual creatures,


739
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.390
you would probably see
a very different world.


740
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.030
[narrator]
In 1916,


741
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.470
Universal Studios'
highest-paid director


742
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.070
was not a man,

743
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.030
but a woman.

744
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.470
Half of all films
before 1925


745
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.310
were written by women.

746
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.470
But today,
only seven percent


747
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:46.230
of Hollywood films
are directed by woman,


748
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:49.110
and in 2017,
not a single female director


749
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.870
was nominated for an Oscar.

750
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.830
In the Hollywood film industry,
woman are declining.


751
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.670
But in another industry,
women are rising.


752
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.110
In the adult industry,
this year


753
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:05.830
36% of AVN-nominated directors
are women.


754
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.310
On the surface,
you'd think that


755
00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.870
the porn industry
is male-dominated.


756
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.790
But since the beginning
of porn,


757
00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:14.710
women have stood
behind the camera,


758
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:17.390
and their numbers
are rapidly increasing.


759
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.710
Today I'm meeting one
of those female directors,


760
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:27.430
the nominated and multi
award-winning director,


761
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:30.430
Jennifer Lyon Bell.

762
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.750
[interviewer]
How did you get the idea
to make porn as your future?


763
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.750
Um, well, it's been something

764
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.950
that I was thinking about
for a long time.


765
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.750
When I was in high school,
I had seen a little bit of porn,


766
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:48.710
and I thought it was
really disappointing because


767
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.150
my friends and I were
somewhat sexually active,


768
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.510
and everything that we did
was much more fun


769
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:56.630
than this porn film that we had
managed to get a hold of.


770
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.670
And over time, I thought, okay,
well, eventually somebody will


771
00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:02.630
start making films
that appeal more to me


772
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.030
or feel more like they're coming
from a woman's perspective.


773
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.030
So that was always a private
fantasy of mine, and then


774
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.670
I went to Harvard for
my undergraduate degree,


775
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.910
and nobody ever graduates
from Harvard


776
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.590
saying,
"I'm going to do porn."


777
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.790
So the boredom in the films
actually triggered you


778
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:20.950
-to make better films?
-Yeah.


779
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.630
When I watched porn,
I thought, "This looks


780
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:27.470
really, um, boring."

781
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.550
The stories are boring,

782
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.270
but also the sex itself doesn't
have a lot of spark to it.


783
00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:36.510
And that's the thing
that I cared most about,
was the spark between people.


784
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.550
So I would look for, like,

785
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.790
the 10 seconds or 20 seconds
in a whole movie


786
00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.670
that was really exciting,
and I would just watch
that 10 seconds.


787
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.950
And after a time, I thought,
"That's kind of a low bar.


788
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:50.030
There should be
more of the movie
that we want to watch."


789
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.390
But what is it that makes
your films different?


790
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.910
Well, I watch a lot of porn
that's made for men and by men,


791
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.590
but what I see
in those films often is


792
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.350
things that I as a woman
can't really relate to.


793
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.710
So one thing that's super
important to me is that


794
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:07.990
women's pleasure and orgasms
be real in the movie.


795
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.710
Because, for me,
if that's not there,
it's a real deal-breaker for me.


796
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.110
-I can't enjoy it.
-Yeah, it definitely
needs to look natural.


797
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.710
Yeah. Yeah.
And so to do that,


798
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.030
what I've learned
as a filmmaker is,


799
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.990
I have to create
a very safe space on set


800
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.470
and create an environment where
the performers have time


801
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.550
to kind of come to orgasm

802
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.590
in their own rhythm.

803
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.270
And that's really different
than most film sets
of any kind


804
00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:39.350
where things are, uh,
a little bit on a pace.


805
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.990
I totally agree.

806
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.390
Real orgasms are
so much better to watch.


807
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:46.310
And why do women fake
all of their orgasms?


808
00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:50.310
I mean, don't men like watching
women have real orgasms?


809
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.510
Well, in porn,
men who watch porn,


810
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.630
I don't think they always can
tell the difference between


811
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.750
real orgasms
and fake orgasms.


812
00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:02.790
I think men would like watching
woman have real orgasms,


813
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:05.870
but as a woman,
my orgasm-dar--


814
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.630
like radar, but for orgasms--
is particularly good,


815
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.750
'cause I'm a woman,
and that's my body.


816
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.910
So we need a real thing.
Just natural.


817
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.830
Definitely. More natural.
I mean, the positions


818
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:19.510
that I like to see in porn

819
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.750
don't have, like,
legs spread wide


820
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.670
with no, like,
clitoral stimulation,


821
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:27.590
And then the woman is screaming,
but the screams don't even sound


822
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.590
like she's having
that much fun.


823
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:33.110
These are things that I wouldn't
put in any of my movies,


824
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:35.030
and I don't think anybody
who is making porn


825
00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.710
for a female audience would
put it in their movies,


826
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.830
because it just doesn't
feel natural.


827
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.030
But the most important thing is,
no matter who
you're working with,


828
00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.510
you have to make people feel
very comfortable.


829
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.190
And in fact, once I decided
that I wanted the actors


830
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.230
to become more comfortable
with each other,


831
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.670
so I had arranged that
they should go to the sauna.


832
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.270
And then I thought,
you know what? I don't
want them to think, like,


833
00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.790
"Oh, you two are the performers,
and I'm up here, the director."


834
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.430
And then I thought,
maybe we should all go
to the sauna together


835
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:02.430
and just kind of
get it over with,
and we'll all be naked.


836
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.630
-Really?
-Yeah.


837
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.230
Like, naked, naked
or bikini naked?


838
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.670
[laughs]
Uh, we were naked, naked.


839
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.870
Wow, that's pretty cool.
So, do people


840
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:16.430
-have assumptions
about your life?
-Yeah.


841
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:20.150
Yeah, like, for example,
people probably assume
that I'm single,


842
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.510
when in fact actually
I have a family


843
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.070
and a daughter.

844
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.910
So does being a mom have
any effect on your work?


845
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:31.390
Not really. I, uh...

846
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.550
I'm proud of what I do,

847
00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.950
and my daughter doesn't
understand it yet


848
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:39.270
because all she knows is that
Mama makes movies for grownups,


849
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.870
and she's, uh, not allowed

850
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.110
-anywhere near it, so, uh...
-Okay.


851
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:47.510
So how big is porn
for women, actually?


852
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.830
When I started,
it was very small.


853
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:53.070
But now it's grown a lot.

854
00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:56.190
And in fact,
now there's a cable channel


855
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.190
that just shows porn
for women.


856
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.190
-[interviewer]
That's really cool.
-Yeah.


857
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.750
[interviewer] And is porn
for women romantic?


858
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:06.710
No. Porn for women
is not always romantic.


859
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:08.950
And you're right that
a lot of people assume


860
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:12.310
that women are
only interested in sex
if there's romance involved.


861
00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.990
But, no, porn for women
is really varied.


862
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.670
A lot of women
really like porn


863
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:21.670
that's not at all romantic,
which is like


864
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.830
BDSM porn, for example,
which doesn't have


865
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:27.150
all of those traditional
hallmarks of romance.


866
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:30.070
It's about chemistry
and connection


867
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:32.070
and being super into
each other,


868
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.430
but that might have nothing
at all to do with romance.


869
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.190
The people might not
end up together.


870
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.870
And I really like that because

871
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:42.070
there are so many messages
in popular culture


872
00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.550
about how women should love
romance, and,


873
00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.870
you know, I think it's nice
to get something else from
your porn as well.


874
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:49.470
[laughs] Yeah.

875
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.990
I also like to experiment.

876
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.870
But apart from BDSM,
what do women like more?


877
00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.150
A lot of women
watch gay porn,


878
00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:00.030
and a lot of women
watch lesbian porn.


879
00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.550
-[interviewer] Lesbian porn?
-I think if you're looking
at real lesbian porn,


880
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:07.150
like, not fake lesbian porn
made for dudes to watch,


881
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.990
but where women are really
actually enjoying each other


882
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:13.150
and getting each other off,
the technique in there


883
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.550
for going down on each other,
for cunnilingus,


884
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.750
is so much better
than what you might see


885
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.990
in a mainstream porn film
that's made for guys,


886
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:23.870
and I think there are a lot
of women who have fantasized


887
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:25.790
about having a same-sex
experience.


888
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.590
[interviewer]
I get what you're saying.


889
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:30.350
I'm kind of into women
too, sometimes.


890
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:33.150
Maybe even more
than I think I do.


891
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:35.870
Well, you know
what I mean, right?


892
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:37.750
-Right?
-Okay.


893
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.750
Yeah. Yeah. Um...

894
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.430
But why is gay porn
so popular?


895
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:44.910
Have you seen gay porn?

896
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:47.830
Well, like, there's so much
to like about it,


897
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.510
you know, from a woman's
perspective.


898
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:51.390
One is that, um,

899
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:54.110
the men are
very good looking.


900
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:57.390
You get to see everything.
You get to see their bodies,


901
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:59.670
but you also get to see
their faces,


902
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.870
and in some mainstream porn,

903
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.950
you don't get to see
either of those things.


904
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:06.750
And in gay porn,
that's all there is.


905
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:09.590
It's... It's really
nice to see.


906
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.150
Are there disadvantages
in making porn for women?


907
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.990
Well, mostly regular people
are super supportive,


908
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:19.510
but companies are
another problem.


909
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:21.870
Nobody wants
to deal with porn,


910
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:25.470
even if it's really
ethical and fun porn.


911
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.150
What I'm making
is something that I think


912
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:33.230
a lot of people really like,
and they're just having
trouble finding it.


913
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:34.830
The final question--

914
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:37.390
Do women have a higher
sex drive?


915
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.270
I don't know if women have
a higher sex drive,


916
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:44.670
but I think women have
a sex drive that's at least
as high as guys'.


917
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.990
I know that I personally
felt, like, weird


918
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.470
because I had a high sex drive,
and now that I have met


919
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.950
so many women who are just
like me, I know that,


920
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:57.750
yeah, this is the way
women are.


921
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.750
The erotic novel
Fifty Shades of Grey


922
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:06.670
has become the fastest-selling
paperback since records began


923
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:10.710
and is on course to sell
one million copies
by the end of 2012,


924
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.110
beating J.K. Rowling's
Harry Potter series


925
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.270
and Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code
to the U.K. record.


926
00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:19.270
[woman] 114 million views
in the first 24 hours, right?


927
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:22.310
More than Star Wars did
in its trailer.


928
00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:25.950
And it's selling
at the unheard-of rate
of one book a second.


929
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.830
And it's essentially
an adult erotic book.


930
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.830
Malaysia banned it
from theaters,


931
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:33.350
calling it
"More pornography than movie."


932
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.230
-[woman] There's a lot of sex.
-Yes.


933
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:38.950
-Graphic sex.
-Yes.


934
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:42.430
But I would say that this movie
is a lot more candid about sex


935
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:45.710
and a lot more articulate
about sex than most are.


936
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.590
Unbelievable. This book has
taken the world by storm.


937
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.190
It's on the cover of Newsweek.
It's been featured in
Time magazine,


938
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.710
it's number one
on the best-seller list


939
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.230
in both the New York Times
and on Amazon.com.


940
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.590
I cannot get on the subway,

941
00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:01.110
nobody can go to a vacation
resort without seeing women


942
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:03.430
holding this book
in their hands.


943
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.670
And I wonder if we've turned
a page with this book
culturally,


944
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.310
that so many people
are reading it,


945
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:12.390
that it has become okay
to really talk about sex.


946
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.830
So what is it about
bondage, discipline,


947
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:16.830
submission and masochism

948
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:18.950
that strikes a chord
with so many women?


949
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.350
This book is tapping into
longings that women have


950
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:24.150
that I would say
particularly the Church


951
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:26.670
hasn't really
acknowledged or addressed,


952
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:30.150
and women are just flocking
to it because they feel like
it's going to meet a need.


953
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.470
[narrator]
Spending money on sex


954
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:35.670
was traditionally
associated with men.


955
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.790
But with the economic rise
of women, more and more women


956
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:42.110
have started spending money
on their sexual desires--


957
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.270
so much so that economists

958
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:47.510
are beginning to re-think
women's sexual behavior.


959
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.430
One of these economists
is Dian Biemans.


960
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:54.150
According to Ms. Biemans,
women may look innocent,


961
00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:56.110
but if we start looking
at the numbers,


962
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.830
we will begin to see
a very different story.


963
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:02.990
If you really want
to understand women,


964
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.670
you need to understand
Fifty Shades of Grey.


965
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:09.350
The reality is that women
have bought this erotic novel


966
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.630
in such a volume,
that it has surpassed


967
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.510
150 million sales

968
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.630
and was translated
into 52 different languages,


969
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:20.030
elevating it to become one
of the most successful pieces
of literature


970
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.430
ever written
in human history.


971
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.550
That should tell us something
about the real desires of women.


972
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.950
And it's certainly not
sugar and spice.


973
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:31.150
I urge people to stop putting
women on pedestals


974
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:33.150
and start looking
at the numbers,


975
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:35.150
because when it comes to sex,

976
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:37.790
the numbers tell
a really different story.


977
00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.110
[interviewer] Why is
Fifty Shades of Grey
so successful?


978
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.110
[Biemans] I think,
in order to truly understand


979
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.710
the success of
Fifty Shades of Grey,


980
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:47.750
you need to stop looking
at the book and start
looking at the author,


981
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.710
a British woman named
Mrs. E.L. James


982
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:54.670
Mrs. James, in all honesty,
is an average-looking,


983
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.870
chubby, middle-aged
white woman.


984
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:59.670
There's absolutely nothing
unique about her.


985
00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.390
She could almost be described
as being 100% average.


986
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:06.790
And that is where
her real success lies,


987
00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:10.430
because she asked herself
one important question--


988
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.830
"In what way can I,
as an average woman,


989
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:16.390
have sex with an alpha male

990
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.070
and still retain
my innocence?"


991
00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.870
Fifty Shades of Grey
addresses the duality


992
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:25.070
that almost
every woman faces.


993
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.470
I believe that
deep inside every woman


994
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:31.350
is a crazy sex drive
waiting to be unleashed.


995
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:34.950
But at the same time,
society teaches women to be


996
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.630
well behaved and proper.

997
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:41.430
But Fifty Shades of Grey managed
to unlock this secret


998
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.350
by allowing a woman's sex drive
to be unleashed


999
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:48.430
while still maintaining
some kind of sexual innocence.


1000
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:52.830
So Fifty Shades of Grey
allows a woman to have
the best of both worlds.


1001
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.790
Yes, exactly. But it's not
just middle-aged women


1002
00:47:55.830 --> 00:47:58.870
who are spending money
on their sexual desires.


1003
00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:02.150
There's another group of women
that is far more lucrative.


1004
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.990
Ask any music executive.
There is no market


1005
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.310
as lucrative
as teenage girls.


1006
00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:11.350
They are more devoted,
and they spend more money
than any other group.


1007
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.110
They even have words to describe
the sexual obsession--


1008
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:17.430
"Bieber fever"
or "One Direction affection."


1009
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:19.590
Just think about it.

1010
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.830
It's girls who hyperventilate

1011
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:24.510
just thinking about boys.

1012
00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:27.510
It's girls who take off their
underwear and throw it at boys.


1013
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:31.790
I don't see boys
taking off their boxers.
Only girls do that.


1014
00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:34.710
Let me just read you
some numbers.


1015
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.910
"1,500 security personnel,

1016
00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:41.390
including 500 policemen,
private security guards,


1017
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:44.310
and 25 emergency
response officers."


1018
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.110
I'm not talking about
the security of the president.


1019
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:51.030
I'm just listing the security
at a Justin Bieber concert.


1020
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:55.070
And this security is
seriously necessary.


1021
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.950
And the past several shows
had to be canceled because


1022
00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.910
the police could not control
the screaming fans.


1023
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:02.990
-That is incredible.
-Yes.


1024
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.030
Some might even argue

1025
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:07.870
that women end up spending
more money on sex than men.


1026
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:12.430
But unlike men, women are
spending more money indirectly.


1027
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:15.230
For example,
some studies show that


1028
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:18.230
women who buy
three-inch-high heels


1029
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:21.390
are almost twice as likely
to receive sexual attention
from men


1030
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:23.670
than women who buy
flat shoes.


1031
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:26.670
And makeup functions
the same way.


1032
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.270
Women want to look sexy
and attractive,


1033
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.070
so much so that
they end up spending


1034
00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.510
incredible amounts
on beauty products.


1035
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:36.590
And just to bring a statistic
for comparison,


1036
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.270
American men are spending
approximately


1037
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:43.350
13 billion dollars a year
on porn-related products,


1038
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:46.790
while women end up spending
approximately 13 billion
on makeup,


1039
00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:50.150
and that doesn't even include
skin care, perfumes
and hair products.


1040
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:55.190
I think one of the most
interesting statistics
are vibrator sales.


1041
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:59.590
Right now the market
for vibrators is $2.9 billion,


1042
00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:03.710
while the market for Internet
porn is just $2.8 billion.


1043
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:07.950
That's right. Women spend
more money on vibrators


1044
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.550
than men spend on
watching Internet porn.


1045
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:14.470
-So, do you think women
have a higher sex drive?
-Yes.


1046
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:18.630
I think sexuality is more a part
of a woman's identity,


1047
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:22.630
in the clothes we wear,
the makeup we put on.


1048
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:26.630
I think we are much more aware
of our own sexuality.


1049
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:29.630
But I don't think men

1050
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.470
display their sexuality
that much.


1051
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:36.390
Sometimes I can walk around
all day feeling sexy,


1052
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:39.630
but I don't think most men
will ever feel that way.


1053
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:45.390
[male TV announcer]
Why more and more men
are ditching marriage,


1054
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.230
fatherhood,
even the American dream.


1055
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:51.390
The reason will surprise you
and perhaps make you nauseous.


1056
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:54.950
So many women staying single,
more than ever before.


1057
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:57.110
'Cause we won't settle
for a lesser love.


1058
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:59.830
We now have
the financial security


1059
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:03.310
and all of the education
and the independence


1060
00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:05.790
as modern women
to wait for the right love,


1061
00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:07.910
and we won't settle for less.

1062
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.150
And when they marry somebody
who's less successful,


1063
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:13.790
their marriages are less
satisfying and more likely
to end in divorce.


1064
00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.950
[man] Recent genetic
research has shown that


1065
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.310
before the modern era,
almost all women


1066
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:21.630
managed to reproduce,
while most of the men did not.


1067
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:24.150
The conclusion from this
is that a few top men


1068
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:26.190
had access
to multiple women,


1069
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.950
while most men had
no mating prospects at all.


1070
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:31.310
Anywhere from 73% to 93%

1071
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:34.230
of the world's societies
have been polygamists.


1072
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:36.870
And the Greeks are the first
really clearly attested


1073
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:40.190
well-known society
that turns towards monogamy.


1074
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:41.830
The question is, why?

1075
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:44.710
The good answer that's been
given is democracy.


1076
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.190
Monogamy is democratic.

1077
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:49.310
This is saying
nothing of women.


1078
00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:52.190
The losers in a polygamist
society are poor men.


1079
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:55.830
They don't have mates.
They become violent and an
unstable element in society.


1080
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:58.070
So they've given up
reading, writing,


1081
00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.830
communicating, exercising,
playing sports.


1082
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:04.350
And for those of you who think
that's not that big of a deal,
it actually is,


1083
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:08.430
because the birthrate
in the country
is declining rapidly.


1084
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:10.910
[narrator]
Recent studies in psychology


1085
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:14.470
have dramatically changed
the way we look
at men and women.


1086
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.110
For years,
psychologists thought that


1087
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:19.590
society controlled
women's sexuality.


1088
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:23.150
But modern psychologists
are beginning to challenge
this theory


1089
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:27.430
and are finding new evidence
that is suggesting
the exact opposite.


1090
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:31.070
Today I'm very excited to meet
one of these psychologists,


1091
00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:33.670
the published author
and TED Talks speaker


1092
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:35.750
Katarina Gabrova.

1093
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:39.750
She believes that women are
driven by deep sexual urges,


1094
00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:43.510
and that once we begin to look
at sex through the lens
of psychology,


1095
00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:47.150
things will begin to look
quite different.


1096
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:49.790
There is a saying that

1097
00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:52.670
everything in the word
is about sex


1098
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.030
except sex itself,

1099
00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:57.870
because sex is about power.

1100
00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:01.150
And when you ask me,
"Do women have a higher
sex drive?"


1101
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:04.830
you are not really asking me
who has a higher sex drive,


1102
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:06.950
but your real question is,

1103
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:09.430
"Who has more power?"

1104
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.830
And I think that is

1105
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:14.150
a very dangerous question.

1106
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:17.990
But I'll try to answer it
with three theories


1107
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.030
linked to female power
and sexuality.


1108
00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:24.350
The first may be
the most interesting one.


1109
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:27.390
Have you ever heard of a man
called Edward Bernays?


1110
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:29.150
[interviewer]
You mean the psychologist?


1111
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:31.430
Well, not a psychologist
himself,


1112
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.430
although he did become
quite famous


1113
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:37.190
for using reverse psychology
on women.


1114
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:39.510
You see, in the 1920s,

1115
00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:42.990
an American tobacco company
hired Bernays


1116
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.790
to encourage women
to start smoking.


1117
00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:48.950
That was a period when most men
used to smoke cigarettes,


1118
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:51.910
but women were not allowed
to smoke in public


1119
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:55.510
as it was seen as something
indecent or un-ladylike.


1120
00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:58.550
But Bernays had
an unusual plan.


1121
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:00.630
He actually hired
a psychoanalyst


1122
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:03.710
to help him research
the psychology of women


1123
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:05.710
and discovered that women

1124
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:08.110
were driven
by deep, primitive


1125
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.710
sexual and competitive urges.

1126
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:13.710
And since it was a very
male-driven society,


1127
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:16.030
he believed that women

1128
00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:18.110
subconsciously had
penis envy


1129
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:22.430
and viewed cigarettes
as a symbol of the penis.


1130
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.910
He realized that if
he could connect cigarettes


1131
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:28.110
with the idea of
challenging male power,


1132
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.670
then women would begin smoking,

1133
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:32.670
because then
women would feel like


1134
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:34.670
they had their own penises

1135
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:37.190
and therefore male power.

1136
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.830
But in order
to achieve his goal,


1137
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:42.550
Edward Bernays did
a very unusual thing.


1138
00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:45.670
He secretly started working
with feminists,


1139
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:49.510
linking smoking
to the equality movement,


1140
00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:51.830
convincing women
that smoking


1141
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:54.670
is the same as
having equal rights.


1142
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:57.950
And his plan was very
successful because, soon after,


1143
00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:01.510
the sales of cigarettes
to women skyrocketed.


1144
00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:03.950
[interviewer]
So women began smoking


1145
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:07.510
-because they wanted male power?
-Exactly.


1146
00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:10.270
Now, the second theory has to do
with natural selection.


1147
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:12.230
Throughout most
of human history,


1148
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.470
almost all societies
have been polygamous.


1149
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:18.030
And I know this may be
hard to believe,


1150
00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:21.990
but according to the social
psychologist Roy Baumeister,


1151
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.190
polygamy actually benefits
most women


1152
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:28.150
and is actually
a female-driven decision.


1153
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:31.270
Because most women would
rather be the second


1154
00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:34.630
or the third wife
of a handsome and rich man


1155
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:37.870
than the only wife
of an average or poor one.


1156
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.710
So for example, most women
wouldn't mind to be one


1157
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:44.630
of the many wives of, let's say,
Brad Pitt or Ryan Gosling.


1158
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:46.710
They would rather do that
than being


1159
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:50.190
the only wife
of a construction worker.


1160
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:52.350
So it's similar
to the 80/20% rule.


1161
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:56.470
Yes. The so-called law
of the vital few.


1162
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:59.750
And in fact contrary
to popular belief,


1163
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:01.750
recent studies suggest

1164
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:04.790
that humanity is not led
by the choices of men


1165
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:07.510
but by the choices of women.

1166
00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:11.190
You see, genetic research
shows that for most
of human history,


1167
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:14.630
80% of women managed
to reproduce,


1168
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.070
while only 40% of men did.

1169
00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:21.230
This actually means that
most men who ever lived


1170
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:24.390
did not even get
a chance to reproduce.


1171
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:26.710
And I think
that this difference


1172
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:30.790
is the single most unappreciated
fact about gender.


1173
00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:33.550
What this actually means is

1174
00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:38.070
that women decide whose genes
carry on, not men.


1175
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:40.150
And that brings me
to the third theory.


1176
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:43.190
I think that sex
in its ultimate form


1177
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:45.470
is the transfer of power.

1178
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:48.670
Men need power in order
to gain access to sex,


1179
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:52.310
but once they are having it,
they lose power.


1180
00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:54.590
But a woman's power
increases.


1181
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:57.150
-[interviewer] Are you
talking about orgasms?
-Yes.


1182
00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:00.750
While the average orgasms
of both genders are similar,


1183
00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:03.630
if we are comparing
the best of the best,


1184
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:07.510
I think it's fair to say
that men simply cannot


1185
00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:11.190
match the power of the most
intense female orgasm.


1186
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:15.470
In fact, according
to Drs. Kaneko and Kitamura,


1187
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:19.030
the female orgasm can be

1188
00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:21.270
than the male orgasm.

1189
00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:24.390
And according to these authors,
should we run the intensity


1190
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.150
of a female orgasm
through a male's brain,


1191
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:32.070
there is a danger that
such a shock to their system


1192
00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:34.190
could actually kill them.

1193
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.430
-Are you serious?
-Yes.


1194
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:38.830
According to these doctors
it may be possible.


1195
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:42.150
If we are looking at
the anatomical differences,


1196
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:45.910
the female clitoris contains

1197
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:50.190
while the head of the penis
only has 4,000 nerve endings.


1198
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:53.590
And can you imagine what
it's like when these 15,000


1199
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:55.870
sexual nerve endings
fire all at once?


1200
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:59.270
Well, it creates force--
a force so strong


1201
00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:02.750
that it almost shuts down
a woman's brain.


1202
00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:05.750
And at that point,
all memory, emotions


1203
00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:08.150
and reasoning functions stop.

1204
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:10.590
And this event
is so powerful


1205
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:13.430
that some may even
call it spiritual.


1206
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:15.710
-Spiritual?
-Yes.


1207
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:18.310
Most people only know about
two dimensions


1208
00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:20.630
when they are talking about
sexual activity--


1209
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:22.910
the physical and emotional.

1210
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:25.830
But some women can reach
a third dimension


1211
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:29.070
when they climax:
the spiritual.


1212
00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:32.830
They describe it as a place
where they can finally let go


1213
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:35.310
of all the physical
and emotional baggage.


1214
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:40.390
So you don't actually
leave your body,


1215
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:45.190
but you have the feel that
you have left everything behind.


1216
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:47.110
Yes. Exactly.

[narrator]
Katarina was right.


1218
00:58:57.190 --> 00:59:00.750
When I have sex,
all of my troubles float away.


1219
00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:04.270
I don't have to think
about any obligations.


1220
00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:06.390
I can just let go

1221
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:08.910
and enjoy intimacy.

1222
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:11.430
Now for the big question--

1223
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:14.710
Who has a higher
sex drive?


1224
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:16.990
Everyone has
a different opinion,


1225
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:19.190
but in my journey,
I found out


1226
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:22.630
that we can experience sex
as spiritual,


1227
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:25.670
we have
multiple ways to orgasm,
and that almost every woman


1228
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:28.030
has a bisexual side.

1229
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:31.830
That's why I think that women
have a higher sex drive.


1230
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:35.350
But the world might have
a different view.


1231
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.510
I was taught to think
about sex in a certain way--


1232
00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:41.950
that a woman is prude
when she doesn't have sex


1233
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:44.150
and that she's a slut
when she does;


1234
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:47.550
that men shouldn't show
their submissive side;


1235
00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:50.710
and that genders
can't be sexually fluid.


1236
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:54.510
But sex is more. It's more
than just reproduction.


1237
00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:58.030
It's more than your sexual
orientation.


1238
00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:00.150
It's more than an action.

1239
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:02.830
The world has become
adjusted to only


1240
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:05.110
one idea of sex.

1241
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:09.430
But as humans, we are capable
of so much more.
