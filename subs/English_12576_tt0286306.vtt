00:02:27.894 --> 00:02:29.904
There's a warrior coming

2
00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:32.365
I'm coming!

3
00:02:38.947 --> 00:02:41.749
Right check your weapons

4
00:02:42.784 --> 00:02:46.504
It's time to prove yourselves, gentlemen
See you all on the other side


5
00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:48.881
Good luck

6
00:02:49.374 --> 00:02:51.134
Ready

7
00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:53.261
Advance

8
00:02:53.294 --> 00:02:56.839
I can't. I can't go

9
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.507
Advance. Move.
You bloody little coward Shakespeare


10
00:02:58.508 --> 00:03:00.968
You're not fit to wear the King's uniform

11
00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.011
Do your duty!

12
00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:04.471
I can't go

13
00:03:04.472 --> 00:03:06.274
Move!

14
00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:08.359
I said move!

15
00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:11.279
This is not the way

16
00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:15.575
Get your men over the top Jennings!

17
00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:19.820
Come on son. Come with me.
You've got to go over


18
00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:21.122
I can't go

19
00:03:22.824 --> 00:03:24.533
Can you just not stay with me?

20
00:03:24.534 --> 00:03:26.493
Come on let's go nail
some Hun together. Yeah?


21
00:03:26.494 --> 00:03:27.911
Gotta go. Gotta go

22
00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:30.164
Right gentlemen good luck!

23
00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:32.884
Good lad. Good lad

24
00:03:35.712 --> 00:03:37.972
Welcome to hell Private Shakespeare

25
00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.497
Oh my God

26
00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:13.633
You're going to have to do this.
Now come on


27
00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.301
Come on

28
00:05:05.635 --> 00:05:09.313
Come on Shakespeare.
Keep your head down, good lad. Come on


29
00:05:19.023 --> 00:05:20.533
Shakespeare

30
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.828
Help me!

31
00:05:47.302 --> 00:05:48.728
Shakespeare

32
00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:12.877
Oh my God!

33
00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:14.754
Jesus!

34
00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:16.255
Christ!

35
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.803
Gas! Gas!

36
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.835
Where's your mask private?

37
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:43.050
Help me

38
00:07:43.418 --> 00:07:44.793
Alright Hawkstone. 
Calm down, calm down

39
00:07:44.794 --> 00:07:46.471
Don't breathe

40
00:08:11.112 --> 00:08:12.747
It's bloody fog

41
00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:23.257
It's just fog. 
It's not the gas

42
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:27.127
It's not the gas

43
00:08:27.128 --> 00:08:30.380
Doc, masks off. It's not gas

44
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:32.966
Boys, take your masks off

45
00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:34.393
It's just fog

46
00:08:41.976 --> 00:08:43.361
What happened to the gas?

47
00:08:44.104 --> 00:08:48.408
Fuck the gas. What happened to the night?

48
00:08:51.528 --> 00:08:54.956
Come on Y company it's not a holiday camp
Let's get moving


49
00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:11.713
Mcness

50
00:09:11.714 --> 00:09:12.589
Sarge

51
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.757
Guess what?

52
00:09:13.758 --> 00:09:15.017
You're on point

53
00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:17.177
Oh, fuckin' 'ell, Sarge!

54
00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:19.513
How comes it's always me first out?

55
00:09:19.514 --> 00:09:20.556
Is it a Scottish thing?

56
00:09:20.557 --> 00:09:21.765
No, it's not a Scottish thing

57
00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:23.142
Aye it is. I know it is.
It's a Scottish thing, isn't it?


58
00:09:23.143 --> 00:09:26.237
It's not, it's because you're a...
because you're a...


59
00:09:26.438 --> 00:09:28.322
...fucking plank!

60
00:09:28.648 --> 00:09:30.408
Aye, well knew it was something

61
00:10:16.738 --> 00:10:19.665
Aaah. Lovely!

62
00:10:27.081 --> 00:10:28.508
That's better

63
00:10:34.714 --> 00:10:36.891
Halten! Halt!

64
00:10:37.884 --> 00:10:39.426
Sergeant, quickly!

65
00:10:39.427 --> 00:10:42.480
You're looking the wrong way. Up here!

66
00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:45.432
Get your filthy hands up!

67
00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:46.225
Verschwindet!

Get your hands up!

69
00:10:48.686 --> 00:10:50.229
Turn around! Up here!

70
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.730
What's the matter with ya?

71
00:10:51.731 --> 00:10:53.649
On me. That's it

72
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.900
Alright, Mcness?

73
00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:56.077
Quinn

74
00:10:57.445 --> 00:10:59.038
Oh, Christ!

75
00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:00.081
Halt!

76
00:11:01.241 --> 00:11:02.825
Fuckin' don't Quinn

77
00:11:02.826 --> 00:11:04.710
Fuck! Shoot him!

78
00:11:04.786 --> 00:11:06.337
Aaagh, he'll disappear!

79
00:11:07.455 --> 00:11:09.215
You, get down

80
00:11:09.707 --> 00:11:10.883
Get down

81
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.428
Come back here!

82
00:11:15.088 --> 00:11:16.672
Get down, you bastard!

83
00:11:16.673 --> 00:11:18.099
Quinn!

84
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.229
Quinn!

85
00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:26.691
Just doin' me job!

86
00:11:47.996 --> 00:11:50.757
Okay, now just calm down, son...

87
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.467
Calm down

88
00:11:53.668 --> 00:11:55.002
Hor zu

89
00:11:55.003 --> 00:11:56.012
Get off me

90
00:11:57.547 --> 00:11:59.098
I don't understand

91
00:12:00.508 --> 00:12:01.717
Do you understand this?

92
00:12:01.718 --> 00:12:06.814
Nimm mich mit! Nimm mich mit!
Nimm mich...


93
00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:12.779
What?

94
00:12:15.982 --> 00:12:17.024
Starinski, deal with him

95
00:12:17.025 --> 00:12:18.326
Sarge!

96
00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:22.488
Look lively lads. We don't know
how many others are still in here


97
00:12:22.489 --> 00:12:23.864
Okay, on your feet. 
Come on, on your feet

98
00:12:23.865 --> 00:12:27.168
Alright, nice and gently, hip and
shoulders, just roll him over gently


99
00:12:29.871 --> 00:12:33.081
Come on, come on, come on. Good man,
good man Chevasse. Now I have to look


100
00:12:33.082 --> 00:12:37.011
I have to look. 
Good man, good man, sssh

101
00:12:37.086 --> 00:12:39.388
Come on, come on Chevasse

102
00:12:40.048 --> 00:12:41.182
Corporal

103
00:12:41.883 --> 00:12:43.509
Oh, God. It hurts

104
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.977
Put your hand here

105
00:12:47.347 --> 00:12:48.055
Yes, sir

106
00:12:48.056 --> 00:12:49.357
How is he?

107
00:12:49.974 --> 00:12:51.526
I think he's cut his spine

108
00:12:52.393 --> 00:12:56.447
The chances are that it'll turn gangrenous
and er, I'm almost out of morphine


109
00:12:57.398 --> 00:12:58.658
I could read to him

110
00:13:00.068 --> 00:13:01.929
Yes, why don't you because that'll help

111
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.706
What'll we do, sir?

112
00:13:06.157 --> 00:13:09.043
Stay here. Hold the trench

113
00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:12.296
Sir, if I don't get him back
to our support trench, he will die


114
00:13:14.666 --> 00:13:15.925
I know

115
00:13:18.378 --> 00:13:19.846
Thank you, Corporal

116
00:13:20.088 --> 00:13:21.305
Yes, sir

117
00:13:24.425 --> 00:13:25.726
Okay, listen

118
00:13:26.386 --> 00:13:29.063
We've captured a forward, German trench

119
00:13:29.264 --> 00:13:31.232
It's a rare achievement, gentlemen

120
00:13:32.517 --> 00:13:34.569
It may be vital to the war effort

121
00:13:34.727 --> 00:13:39.240
We will hold this trench until
we are reinforced. We must...


122
00:13:40.608 --> 00:13:42.326
...that is our duty

123
00:13:43.778 --> 00:13:46.289
Get some scoff on, get a brew going...

124
00:13:46.739 --> 00:13:48.740
See if we can't make
the best of it, eh?

125
00:13:48.741 --> 00:13:50.418
Make the best of it?

126
00:13:50.618 --> 00:13:52.837
He makes it sound like a bloody holiday

127
00:13:53.913 --> 00:13:55.715
I went to Blackpool once

128
00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:58.092
Yeah?

129
00:13:58.585 --> 00:14:00.094
Nice?

130
00:14:02.297 --> 00:14:05.308
I killed a man there. 
Yeah, it was nice

131
00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:22.492
How old are you, son?

132
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.692
Nineteen Sarge

133
00:14:23.693 --> 00:14:26.329
Don't fuck me about. 
How old are you?

134
00:14:29.282 --> 00:14:30.500
Sixteen

135
00:14:32.327 --> 00:14:33.795
And a half

136
00:14:36.164 --> 00:14:40.176
Bloody hell. So you lied
about your age and signed up?


137
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.002
Yeah?

138
00:14:42.003 --> 00:14:44.263
Is this what you wanted? Eh?

139
00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:48.142
Go and sit over there

140
00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.563
Come and sit down here

141
00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:59.821
Och, don't worry about it.
He didn't believe I was nineteen either


142
00:15:01.523 --> 00:15:03.157
We're not secure, sir

143
00:15:03.191 --> 00:15:04.817
Well the men are exhausted,
they need a rest


144
00:15:04.818 --> 00:15:06.360
This is a German dug out

145
00:15:06.361 --> 00:15:09.247
It'll be dark soon. 
We're not secure, sir

146
00:15:09.572 --> 00:15:11.791
Yes, of course, you're right, sergeant

147
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:16.703
Right, let's secure the trench

148
00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:17.830
Sergeant, if you would

149
00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:19.132
Yeah

150
00:15:19.707 --> 00:15:23.961
Right Quinn, Starinski, Hawkestone,
McNess, Shakespeare -


151
00:15:23.962 --> 00:15:25.462
we're gonna secure this trench

152
00:15:25.463 --> 00:15:26.421
Oh bloody hell, Sarge

153
00:15:26.422 --> 00:15:28.298
Doc, if you can take Chevasse up there,
under that cover


154
00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:29.633
Make him as comfortable as possible

155
00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:30.300
Sarge

156
00:15:30.301 --> 00:15:31.644
What about him?

157
00:15:32.637 --> 00:15:36.190
I don't want him watching my back

158
00:15:38.935 --> 00:15:40.528
Shakespeare's coming

159
00:15:40.979 --> 00:15:43.197
Right, ladies. Move out!

160
00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:05.720
Y Company on me, anything to report?

161
00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:08.097
It's like a maze, Sarge

162
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.591
There's no front line or nothing

163
00:16:10.592 --> 00:16:12.176
What's the fuckin' point of that?

164
00:16:12.177 --> 00:16:13.510
Maybe they forgot where the war was

165
00:16:13.511 --> 00:16:14.928
Feels like the war was in here

166
00:16:14.929 --> 00:16:17.473
Right lads, listen up.
If we're going to hold this trench


167
00:16:17.474 --> 00:16:19.767
we need to make it
a smaller area to defend


168
00:16:19.768 --> 00:16:21.393
We'll set charges here,

169
00:16:21.394 --> 00:16:23.729
here and twenty yards down there,
on the right


170
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.990
That'll bring down
this section of the dugout


171
00:16:26.065 --> 00:16:27.867
After that, we rest

172
00:16:28.109 --> 00:16:29.911
Come on, move it!

173
00:16:37.577 --> 00:16:39.170
Who's going to be hiding here?

174
00:16:39.788 --> 00:16:42.715
Well, that German and his pals for one

175
00:16:46.503 --> 00:16:47.720
Help me

176
00:16:53.134 --> 00:16:56.104
It's just pure luck you made it this far,
isn't it, Shakespeare?


177
00:16:57.305 --> 00:16:59.890
We've wired up the detonator right,
haven't we?


178
00:16:59.891 --> 00:17:02.111
If you've got it wrong
you'll blow us all to hell


179
00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:05.571
Don't you trust me, huh?

180
00:17:06.272 --> 00:17:07.698
Well, that's a good sign

181
00:17:07.732 --> 00:17:08.950
Alright, heads down

182
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.955
Why isn't...

183
00:17:28.962 --> 00:17:30.963
Jesus Christ, did you hear that?

184
00:17:30.964 --> 00:17:32.390
Aye

185
00:17:32.674 --> 00:17:33.966
Good work lads

186
00:17:33.967 --> 00:17:35.768
What bloody good is that?

187
00:17:36.052 --> 00:17:38.521
Only half as much to defend now,
isn't there?


188
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.512
Corporal!

189
00:18:12.213 --> 00:18:13.389
Sir!

190
00:18:14.632 --> 00:18:18.019
How long would you say
we were walking back there in the fog?


191
00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:20.679
Couple of hours, maybe?

192
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.064
Really?

193
00:18:24.684 --> 00:18:26.069
Why?

194
00:18:26.394 --> 00:18:28.112
Well I...

195
00:18:30.565 --> 00:18:31.866
Sir

196
00:18:35.904 --> 00:18:37.330
Bradford,

197
00:18:37.572 --> 00:18:41.033
It's one of these new crystal radio units,
sir. We've got then in command


198
00:18:41.034 --> 00:18:43.086
But can we raise HQ with it?

199
00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:45.213
I don't know, I can try

200
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:50.009
There's so many dead

201
00:18:51.586 --> 00:18:54.055
That German's gonna be
a million miles from here


202
00:18:54.297 --> 00:18:56.089
There's plenty of rats, though

203
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.850
That's a German bayonet

204
00:18:59.093 --> 00:19:00.770
Were they fighting each other?

205
00:19:01.262 --> 00:19:03.022
Hun sticking Hun

206
00:19:04.224 --> 00:19:06.809
Jesus, what happened here? Look at this

207
00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.111
But why?

208
00:19:09.395 --> 00:19:10.822
Maybe gas

209
00:19:13.566 --> 00:19:15.743
Gas can make you do funny things

210
00:19:16.486 --> 00:19:18.329
What do you think McNess?

211
00:19:18.446 --> 00:19:21.615
I think, if they keep this up,

212
00:19:21.616 --> 00:19:23.835
we won't have to do any fighting ourselves

213
00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:31.676
Oi!

214
00:19:36.047 --> 00:19:38.224
Woah, close one!

215
00:19:38.466 --> 00:19:39.809
What is it?

216
00:19:39.926 --> 00:19:41.394
It's a bullet

217
00:19:45.807 --> 00:19:48.943
I'd hang on to that. 
Might be lucky

218
00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:51.279
Lucky it didn't blow his balls off!

219
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.406
Right!

220
00:19:55.316 --> 00:19:59.287
Nobody rests until we secure every inch
of this trench. Alright?!


221
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.955
Sarge

222
00:20:01.239 --> 00:20:02.790
Now, on me

223
00:20:27.265 --> 00:20:31.018
Shakespeare. Take this morphine.
Make sure Doc gets it for Chevasse


224
00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:31.894
Yes sir

225
00:20:31.895 --> 00:20:34.989
Don't call me sir, lad. I'm a sergeant.
I work for a living


226
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.159
Take it down

227
00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:41.746
Take it down. Good boy, good boy

228
00:20:43.114 --> 00:20:44.290
That's it

229
00:20:47.118 --> 00:20:48.336
I think

230
00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:52.006
I think I can
move my hands a little

231
00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:54.634
Well that's good

232
00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:57.053
Look

233
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.640
See my fingers?

234
00:21:02.842 --> 00:21:03.926
See them moving?

235
00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:05.228
I do yeah

236
00:21:05.428 --> 00:21:07.647
We'll have you doing
the Lambeth Walk in no time


237
00:21:08.389 --> 00:21:09.732
And this'll help

238
00:21:20.276 --> 00:21:21.527
Right get some rest

239
00:21:21.528 --> 00:21:22.787
You're not going

240
00:21:23.613 --> 00:21:25.489
I have to go mate there's
a lot of work to be done,


241
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.334
but Bradford's here though, okay?
Now get some sleep


242
00:21:30.245 --> 00:21:31.504
Keep an eye on him

243
00:21:49.764 --> 00:21:51.065
No tits on her

244
00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.142
Wouldn't mind that

245
00:21:53.143 --> 00:21:54.527
Keep that one

246
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:56.404
That one will do

247
00:21:58.982 --> 00:22:00.241
What?

248
00:22:03.236 --> 00:22:04.662
Any British command

249
00:22:05.321 --> 00:22:06.914
Any British command

250
00:22:08.158 --> 00:22:11.002
Any British command
receiving this please respond


251
00:22:11.786 --> 00:22:13.921
Any Allied listening post

252
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.092
This is a British unit lost in enemy
territory. Urgently need assistance over


253
00:22:19.169 --> 00:22:22.680
Anyone. Anyone, fucking anyone. Shit

254
00:22:22.964 --> 00:22:26.967
Y company. Y company. We've lost...

255
00:22:26.968 --> 00:22:28.469
Captain Jennings. Captain!

256
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:29.720
We've lost Y company

257
00:22:29.721 --> 00:22:30.804
Bradford

258
00:22:30.805 --> 00:22:33.891
No, no this is Y company.
There are survivors


259
00:22:33.892 --> 00:22:35.401
We've lost Y company

260
00:22:35.935 --> 00:22:37.153
What is it?

261
00:22:37.187 --> 00:22:38.020
Have you made contact?

262
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:38.896
Yes, sir

263
00:22:38.897 --> 00:22:39.772
Well done

264
00:22:39.773 --> 00:22:41.106
Y Company. There are no survivors

265
00:22:41.107 --> 00:22:42.316
Repeat. There are no survivors

266
00:22:42.317 --> 00:22:45.652
This is Captain Bramwell Jennings,
Y Company, 5th Battalion


267
00:22:45.653 --> 00:22:48.197
We have captured a forward German trench

268
00:22:48.198 --> 00:22:51.200
Location unknown.
We need urgent support, over


269
00:22:51.201 --> 00:22:51.992
Y Company

270
00:22:51.993 --> 00:22:53.577
Yes, Y Company

271
00:22:53.578 --> 00:22:55.162
There are no survivors.
There are no survivors


272
00:22:55.163 --> 00:22:56.330
What's that mean?
Why are they saying that?


273
00:22:56.331 --> 00:22:57.790
It's a mistake, it's a mistake.
They'll send support


274
00:22:57.791 --> 00:22:59.166
But if they think we're dead
they won't try to find us...


275
00:22:59.167 --> 00:23:00.501
It's a mistake. 
It's a mistake

276
00:23:00.502 --> 00:23:01.460
Y Company?

277
00:23:01.461 --> 00:23:03.801
The survivors of Y Company
have regrouped. We are...


278
00:23:10.345 --> 00:23:11.470
Don't tell the men

279
00:23:11.471 --> 00:23:11.970
But sir...

280
00:23:11.971 --> 00:23:14.515
Do you understand me, don't tell the men

281
00:23:14.516 --> 00:23:17.110
It's a mistake. 
They will find us

282
00:23:17.185 --> 00:23:20.738
GEFANGENENGMBEN

283
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.118
Hawkestone!

284
00:24:07.444 --> 00:24:08.786
Sergeant!

285
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.456
Sergeant!

286
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:15.585
Get down!

287
00:24:17.245 --> 00:24:19.547
Get down, you fuckin' Hun bastard

288
00:24:20.081 --> 00:24:21.215
Fuck you!

289
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:32.894
Sergeant!

290
00:24:33.094 --> 00:24:34.353
Sergeant!

291
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.233
Halt! Halt you fucking Hun bastard

292
00:24:43.313 --> 00:24:44.781
Starinski!

293
00:24:45.273 --> 00:24:49.860
Hello mate. Hello Fritzen.
You are gonna die!


294
00:24:49.861 --> 00:24:52.446
What do you want? What do you want?
This one, or this one, eh?


295
00:24:52.447 --> 00:24:54.082
This one, or this one?

296
00:24:59.287 --> 00:25:00.922
Oi, Quinn

297
00:25:01.873 --> 00:25:03.123
Not, while I'm around

298
00:25:03.124 --> 00:25:04.500
Yeah, how long's that gonna be then?

299
00:25:04.501 --> 00:25:05.885
Long enough

300
00:25:08.588 --> 00:25:11.599
Thank fuck he's on our side, huh?

301
00:25:35.115 --> 00:25:37.041
I really thought my time was up

302
00:25:38.243 --> 00:25:39.710
Got a girl at home

303
00:25:41.579 --> 00:25:42.996
Yeah

304
00:25:42.997 --> 00:25:44.632
What's she like?

305
00:25:45.333 --> 00:25:46.592
She blonde?

306
00:25:47.168 --> 00:25:48.302
Brunette?

307
00:25:48.545 --> 00:25:49.336
I'd love a piece of cheese

308
00:25:49.337 --> 00:25:50.963
I know you would

309
00:25:50.964 --> 00:25:52.348
Wensleydale

310
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:54.058
Lancashire crumbly

311
00:25:54.342 --> 00:25:55.476
Cheddar

312
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.022
I'd better take watch

313
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.524
Good luck, yeah

314
00:26:01.683 --> 00:26:05.102
Well Shakespeare, that were a
gastronomic delight. Well done, son


315
00:26:05.103 --> 00:26:06.612
Glad you liked it Sarge

316
00:26:07.105 --> 00:26:09.198
That was so good,
you can have me blanket

317
00:26:10.275 --> 00:26:11.534
Thank you, Sarge

318
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.871
A few seconds,
and you'll be out like a light


319
00:26:15.238 --> 00:26:16.664
So get some sleep

320
00:26:16.823 --> 00:26:18.124
Thanks, Doc

321
00:26:22.912 --> 00:26:24.172
Bradford?

322
00:26:24.581 --> 00:26:27.361
Come and have a pew by the fire.
Let me have a look at that leg


323
00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:34.715
Any luck with the radio?

324
00:26:34.716 --> 00:26:36.017
Er, not yet

325
00:26:36.384 --> 00:26:38.552
The chances of getting a
signal are pretty slim


326
00:26:38.553 --> 00:26:40.387
More likely to end
up talking to the Hun

327
00:26:40.388 --> 00:26:41.889
Well, that's not a bad thing

328
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.150
At least they might be
able to tell us where we a


329
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.818
Doesn't the Captain know?

330
00:26:45.935 --> 00:26:47.019
Doubt it

331
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.920
I think he'd rather be tucked up
in Sandhurst, polishing his boots


332
00:26:50.315 --> 00:26:51.774
You served with him before?

333
00:26:51.775 --> 00:26:54.994
No, no. He was posted to us
when our last CO was hit


334
00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:56.278
He seems decent enough

335
00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:58.579
He seems like a man out of his depth,
if you ask me


336
00:26:59.073 --> 00:27:00.583
At least we've still got Tate

337
00:27:06.331 --> 00:27:08.341
Chevasse is gonna die, isn't he?

338
00:27:09.584 --> 00:27:10.843
Yeah

339
00:27:11.753 --> 00:27:13.387
I shipped over with him

340
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.932
He said he had a fiance in Norwich

341
00:27:16.508 --> 00:27:17.424
What?

342
00:27:17.425 --> 00:27:18.726
Well you heard the joke?

343
00:27:19.928 --> 00:27:21.053
What joke?

344
00:27:21.054 --> 00:27:22.355
Girl in Norwich

345
00:27:22.764 --> 00:27:24.023
I don't get it

346
00:27:25.475 --> 00:27:27.392
Knickers. Off. Ready

347
00:27:27.393 --> 00:27:29.895
When. I. Come. Home.
Norwich, you see. It's a joke


348
00:27:29.896 --> 00:27:31.489
Oh

349
00:27:31.731 --> 00:27:32.523
You haven't heard it?

350
00:27:32.524 --> 00:27:33.273
No

351
00:27:33.274 --> 00:27:35.400
Right. You've dressed this well

352
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:37.111
Yeah, practice makes perfect

353
00:27:37.112 --> 00:27:39.705
I'm only twenty,
I've already been shot four times


354
00:27:39.948 --> 00:27:41.609
Your friend up there must like you

355
00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.128
Not exactly spreading it
around much though is he?


356
00:27:45.829 --> 00:27:47.672
God has love for us all

357
00:27:48.373 --> 00:27:50.165
You just have to open your heart

358
00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:52.677
I don't think God is anywhere
near this place


359
00:27:53.253 --> 00:27:54.971
He brought us here, didn't he?

360
00:27:55.255 --> 00:27:59.133
Out of the battle, out of the gas.
We were blessed


361
00:27:59.134 --> 00:28:02.270
Blessed? Really.
What about Chevasse, is he blessed?


362
00:28:02.679 --> 00:28:04.981
God works in mysterious ways

363
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:07.400
And there are better places than here

364
00:28:08.351 --> 00:28:11.478
Fuckin' Sergeant needs anything doing,
it's always McNess


365
00:28:11.479 --> 00:28:14.031
McNess, you killed the president,
McNess on point


366
00:28:14.315 --> 00:28:16.733
What about Starinski?
It's never fuckin' Quinn


367
00:28:16.734 --> 00:28:18.193
What about Hawkestone? No

368
00:28:18.194 --> 00:28:19.537
Fuckin' me

369
00:28:20.113 --> 00:28:21.488
I know what it is

370
00:28:21.489 --> 00:28:24.792
It's a Scottish thing.
He doesn't like Scots, that's what it is


371
00:28:25.994 --> 00:28:27.795
Maybe it's because he trusts you

372
00:28:28.121 --> 00:28:30.631
Aye. Well, there's that as well

373
00:28:31.791 --> 00:28:33.760
Trust me on this, right?

374
00:28:34.502 --> 00:28:35.928
We shouldn't be here

375
00:28:37.172 --> 00:28:39.265
Fuckin' dead bodies everywhere

376
00:28:41.009 --> 00:28:44.771
Why? Why haven't they come back
for the trench?


377
00:28:45.638 --> 00:28:47.732
Why haven't they come back for the men?

378
00:28:48.057 --> 00:28:51.402
Ah? Why haven't they come back for you?

379
00:28:52.479 --> 00:28:53.863
We shouldn't be here

380
00:28:55.231 --> 00:28:57.325
Do you think our men
will come back for us?


381
00:29:32.602 --> 00:29:36.030
Stay alert. Stay awake

382
00:29:49.702 --> 00:29:52.964
Right, that says prison to me

383
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:03.683
Get in there

384
00:30:04.634 --> 00:30:06.018
In there

385
00:30:06.386 --> 00:30:07.803
Aye, why not?

386
00:30:07.804 --> 00:30:08.813
Get in there

387
00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:16.612
Get in

388
00:30:16.771 --> 00:30:18.489
Or I'll fuckin' shoot ya

389
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:20.408
Get in!

390
00:30:22.902 --> 00:30:24.120
Shoot him!

391
00:30:25.738 --> 00:30:27.156
Go on, shoot him

392
00:30:27.157 --> 00:30:28.073
Why?

393
00:30:28.074 --> 00:30:30.251
Because he kicked me in the fuckin' balls

394
00:30:30.452 --> 00:30:32.712
Why kill him.
What good's that going to do anyone?


395
00:30:33.538 --> 00:30:34.672
He's scared

396
00:30:38.126 --> 00:30:39.552
Fuckin' should be

397
00:30:40.253 --> 00:30:43.714
Come on, what else you gonna do?

398
00:30:43.715 --> 00:30:44.932
Get in

399
00:30:46.843 --> 00:30:47.801
Come here

400
00:30:47.802 --> 00:30:51.773
McNess. McNess, don't!

401
00:31:02.484 --> 00:31:06.788
What now? Do you wanna
make him a wee cup of cocoa?


402
00:31:16.956 --> 00:31:19.425
Evenin' Fraulein

403
00:31:46.402 --> 00:31:48.830
Oh, yeah

404
00:31:55.578 --> 00:31:58.881
Yeah. Yeah

405
00:31:59.415 --> 00:32:01.968
Oh...this fuckinn' rain!

406
00:32:05.588 --> 00:32:06.672
Come on

407
00:32:06.673 --> 00:32:08.558
Yeah, nearly there

408
00:32:10.218 --> 00:32:13.438
Yeah...

409
00:32:15.181 --> 00:32:16.649
Oi, who's that?

410
00:32:36.703 --> 00:32:38.004
Quinn!

411
00:32:41.749 --> 00:32:44.010
Not fuckin' funny!

412
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:33.351
Got ya

413
00:33:42.811 --> 00:33:45.071
What the fuck is goin' on here?

414
00:34:23.184 --> 00:34:26.863
Oh my fuckin' God. Sergeant!

415
00:34:27.564 --> 00:34:29.282
Better come and see this

416
00:34:39.868 --> 00:34:41.711
Starinski!

417
00:34:44.372 --> 00:34:48.509
There. Quinn, Hawkestone down there.
Shakespeare with me


418
00:35:11.649 --> 00:35:13.493
Starinski!

419
00:35:14.402 --> 00:35:15.694
You try up there, 
I'm going down here

420
00:35:15.695 --> 00:35:16.913
Sergeant

421
00:35:47.977 --> 00:35:49.862
Sergeant...

422
00:35:51.898 --> 00:35:53.616
I've found Starinski

423
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.748
There's more Germans here

424
00:36:01.491 --> 00:36:02.959
We're gonna have to find them

425
00:36:09.124 --> 00:36:10.550
Ich will fort von hier

426
00:36:10.583 --> 00:36:11.625
English!

427
00:36:11.626 --> 00:36:13.877
(DO YOU SPEAK FRENCH)

428
00:36:13.878 --> 00:36:15.596
Speak any French, Captain?

429
00:36:15.797 --> 00:36:17.223
I can

430
00:36:19.467 --> 00:36:20.893
(WHERE IS )

431
00:36:22.554 --> 00:36:24.188
(WHERE IS )

432
00:36:25.431 --> 00:36:28.401
...the other...ou est I'autre?

433
00:36:30.603 --> 00:36:31.645
What's French for German?

434
00:36:31.646 --> 00:36:32.729
(WHERE IS THE OTHER GERMAN? )

435
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.149
Shut up! I'm not askin' you

436
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.985
(I DON'T KNOW)

437
00:36:37.986 --> 00:36:40.886
I was a liaison with the French Command
before coming to the front


438
00:36:41.906 --> 00:36:43.323
I can speak French

439
00:36:43.324 --> 00:36:45.451
Well you'd better do the translating then
Sir


440
00:36:45.452 --> 00:36:46.836
Go on son Sir

441
00:36:49.581 --> 00:36:51.123
(M Y NAME IS...)

442
00:36:51.124 --> 00:36:51.832
(GO AHEAD)

443
00:36:51.833 --> 00:36:55.133
Yeah, you're not proposing fucking
marriage. Just find out where his mate is


444
00:36:55.211 --> 00:36:57.546
(WE HAVE TO GO NOW OR YOU'LL ALL DIE.
BELIEVE ME)


445
00:36:57.547 --> 00:36:59.715
(IF YOU ATTACK US NO ONE WILL SURVIVE)

446
00:36:59.716 --> 00:37:01.017
What's he saying?

447
00:37:01.176 --> 00:37:04.344
He said...well, sir, it's very hard...

448
00:37:04.345 --> 00:37:05.646
What's he saying?

449
00:37:08.183 --> 00:37:12.570
He said...look, I,
I think he said we're all going to die


450
00:37:13.146 --> 00:37:16.690
It's his Kraut chum who's gonna die

451
00:37:16.691 --> 00:37:18.567
He said something
about turning on each other


452
00:37:18.568 --> 00:37:21.195
I'm going to wrap barbed wire around him

453
00:37:21.196 --> 00:37:24.198
and squeeze him until he's nothing
but little pieces


454
00:37:24.199 --> 00:37:25.739
He said none of us will survive

455
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.077
(WHERE IS THE OTHER GERMAN? )

456
00:37:29.078 --> 00:37:32.873
( I DON'T KNOW)

457
00:37:32.874 --> 00:37:34.124
Tell him that we know

458
00:37:34.125 --> 00:37:36.210
his friend murdered one of my men

459
00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:38.420
...and when we find him
we're gonna kill him. Tell him that


460
00:37:38.421 --> 00:37:41.715
(M Y CAPTAIN SAYS WE'LL FIND HIM
AND KILL HIM)


461
00:37:41.716 --> 00:37:44.885
(WE AREN'T THE ENEM Y. IT'
S SOMETHING ELSE

462
00:37:44.886 --> 00:37:49.056
(THERE IS SOMETHING BAD HERE)

463
00:37:49.057 --> 00:37:50.724
He said they're not the enemy. He said...

464
00:37:50.725 --> 00:37:52.893
...there's something wrong
with this place, with this trench...


465
00:37:52.894 --> 00:37:54.937
Look he said it's in the earth,
in the ground...


466
00:37:54.938 --> 00:37:56.155
In the ground

467
00:37:56.231 --> 00:37:57.731
They must be using tunnels to get about

468
00:37:57.732 --> 00:38:00.692
(IT WILL KILL US ALL.
IT WILL KILL YOU AS WELL. PLEASE)


469
00:38:00.693 --> 00:38:02.903
(WE MUST GO)

470
00:38:02.904 --> 00:38:05.155
It killed all of them, it's gonna
kill us too. He says we should leave


471
00:38:05.156 --> 00:38:11.453
( SOMETHING EVIL HERE. EVIL. EVIL.)

472
00:38:11.454 --> 00:38:12.704
Mal. What's that, what's that word?

473
00:38:12.705 --> 00:38:15.716
Evil. It means evil

474
00:38:33.017 --> 00:38:35.862
This is Y Company,
and we're still alive...


475
00:38:37.856 --> 00:38:41.701
Is anybody there? Anybody?

476
00:38:42.569 --> 00:38:45.413
This is Y Company, and we're still alive

477
00:38:46.448 --> 00:38:52.003
No. No. No, we are alive!

478
00:38:52.954 --> 00:38:55.173
We are still alive

479
00:39:03.923 --> 00:39:05.308
Bradford

480
00:39:12.265 --> 00:39:13.566
Chevasse

481
00:39:26.488 --> 00:39:27.789
Who's there?

482
00:39:28.823 --> 00:39:30.249
Who are you?

483
00:39:35.205 --> 00:39:36.631
Who are you?

484
00:39:41.753 --> 00:39:44.222
These Bosch are worse dead than alive

485
00:39:48.843 --> 00:39:50.478
So what's the point of this?

486
00:39:50.678 --> 00:39:52.605
It's easy to hide
in the bodies isn't it

487
00:39:52.722 --> 00:39:55.566
Put them all in one place,
and there's one less place to hide


488
00:39:57.352 --> 00:39:58.653
That's the last of them

489
00:39:59.521 --> 00:40:01.030
Those we can move anyway

490
00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:06.369
So much death

491
00:40:08.446 --> 00:40:10.123
Beggars the imagination

492
00:40:12.367 --> 00:40:14.794
Perhaps you'd like to say
a few words, Bradford


493
00:40:17.872 --> 00:40:20.612
The Captain's saying he wants
to hear something from your book


494
00:40:21.626 --> 00:40:22.927
Very well

495
00:40:33.179 --> 00:40:35.356
And the four angels were loosed...

496
00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:38.767
...which were prepared for an hour,
and a day,


497
00:40:38.768 --> 00:40:40.987
and a month, and a year

498
00:40:41.104 --> 00:40:43.656
For they were to slay
the third part of men...


499
00:40:44.566 --> 00:40:49.078
...by the fire, by the smoke
and by the brimstone


500
00:40:49.571 --> 00:40:51.914
...which rained down about their heads

501
00:40:53.408 --> 00:40:55.668
We have all made a covenant with death...

502
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.963
...and with hell we are in agreement

503
00:40:59.581 --> 00:41:04.302
Who do you think you are,
the Archbishop of fuckin' Canterbury?


504
00:41:05.128 --> 00:41:08.389
Ignore him.
You send one up there for me, aye


505
00:41:09.048 --> 00:41:11.967
When the over flown scourge
shall pass through...


506
00:41:11.968 --> 00:41:14.103
...you shall be trodden down by it

507
00:41:26.775 --> 00:41:28.493
Are these better than ours?

508
00:41:29.736 --> 00:41:33.781
Well if you're looking for a nice line
in shrapnel wounds and severed limbs. Yeah


509
00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:35.333
Probably a little better

510
00:41:35.867 --> 00:41:38.795
Mind you I hear our pineapples
make a pretty good fruit salad


511
00:41:46.085 --> 00:41:47.762
Why are we doing this?

512
00:41:48.421 --> 00:41:54.435
Ah, well...sometimes it's just better
to be doing something


513
00:41:54.636 --> 00:41:57.021
We know the enemy's still here
somewhere, so...


514
00:41:57.847 --> 00:42:00.983
Captain tells us we have to stay
and hold the trench, so...


515
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:05.029
...we stay and hold the trench. That's the
chain of command, we do what we're told


516
00:42:05.647 --> 00:42:07.031
And what then?

517
00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:11.119
All of us at risk to hold this place,
and we, we don't even know where it is


518
00:42:12.862 --> 00:42:14.330
Or what it is

519
00:42:16.241 --> 00:42:18.325
Right, we've got underground saps
all along here, yeah?


520
00:42:18.326 --> 00:42:19.794
Some of them have got tunnels

521
00:42:19.953 --> 00:42:22.130
There, there and down there

522
00:42:22.455 --> 00:42:25.415
So we just chuck grenades in
and collapse the entrances?


523
00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:26.667
Yeah, that's about the sum of it

524
00:42:26.668 --> 00:42:27.960
Do you think it will work, Sarge?

525
00:42:27.961 --> 00:42:29.262
Why not?

526
00:42:29.337 --> 00:42:33.099
Oh, come on.
There's a bad feeling here. This trench


527
00:42:33.508 --> 00:42:34.851
What you talking about?

528
00:42:35.718 --> 00:42:36.677
Sarge, something isn't right...

529
00:42:36.678 --> 00:42:38.312
What?

530
00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.639
Nothing

531
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.020
Right, with a bit of luck the whole thing
will cave in and trap him down there


532
00:42:44.519 --> 00:42:46.019
Aye, or drive them out into the open

533
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.147
Yeah, either way we've got a result.
Alright?


534
00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:48.689
Aye

535
00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:49.782
Bradford!

536
00:42:53.695 --> 00:42:54.996
Bradford!

537
00:42:55.613 --> 00:42:58.458
Tell Jennings one minute. Go on. Go!

538
00:43:06.166 --> 00:43:06.957
We're ready, sir

539
00:43:06.958 --> 00:43:08.041
One minute

540
00:43:08.042 --> 00:43:10.136
Very good. Tell him to proceed

541
00:43:11.129 --> 00:43:12.388
One minute

542
00:43:38.406 --> 00:43:39.540
Go on!

543
00:44:03.097 --> 00:44:04.607
Come on, on your feet

544
00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:05.766
Patrol coming

545
00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:06.943
Get up!

546
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.753
Tate?

547
00:44:27.789 --> 00:44:29.132
Tate!

548
00:44:54.274 --> 00:44:55.983
Incoming! Artillery!

549
00:44:55.984 --> 00:44:58.777
Hawkestone, go find the Captain. Go, Go!

550
00:44:58.778 --> 00:44:59.862
Sergeant

551
00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:02.790
Move! Move! Get in the bunkers

552
00:45:02.824 --> 00:45:04.375
Take cover lads!

553
00:45:09.414 --> 00:45:10.539
Take cover, boys

554
00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.758
Fuck off!

555
00:45:14.627 --> 00:45:16.545
Shakespeare, get back in there!

556
00:45:16.546 --> 00:45:17.838
In with Doc. Go!

557
00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:19.891
Charley, Charley!

558
00:45:21.342 --> 00:45:22.894
Charley, get in here!

559
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.814
Keep down!

560
00:45:27.182 --> 00:45:27.764
Keep the...where's it coming from?

561
00:45:27.765 --> 00:45:28.348
Keep down! Keep down!

562
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:29.516
Where are they?

563
00:45:29.517 --> 00:45:30.350
They're coming!

564
00:45:30.351 --> 00:45:31.778
Right, here they come

565
00:45:31.811 --> 00:45:35.073
Steady boys. Make every bullet count!

566
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.326
Stay focused

567
00:45:39.152 --> 00:45:40.411
Easy

568
00:45:40.695 --> 00:45:42.246
Any second now

569
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.461
Captain!

570
00:45:51.623 --> 00:45:52.882
Tate!

571
00:45:53.291 --> 00:45:54.425
Tate!

572
00:45:56.878 --> 00:45:58.054
Tate!

573
00:46:07.013 --> 00:46:08.189
Tate!

574
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:10.650
Tate!

575
00:46:17.982 --> 00:46:21.744
Tate! Tate!

576
00:46:23.279 --> 00:46:25.164
They're coming!

577
00:46:30.662 --> 00:46:31.838
They're coming!

578
00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:33.872
They're coming! 
Tate, where are you?

579
00:46:33.873 --> 00:46:35.800
Goddammit, where are you?

580
00:46:46.845 --> 00:46:48.563
Come on!

581
00:46:54.936 --> 00:46:56.195
Who are you?

582
00:47:25.091 --> 00:47:26.967
What happened? 
Huh, put the gun down!

583
00:47:26.968 --> 00:47:29.103
Captain, put the gun down, it's me

584
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.564
Put...put the gun down

585
00:47:31.723 --> 00:47:32.940
Cap...

586
00:47:33.933 --> 00:47:38.145
Oh, Jesus Christ

587
00:47:38.146 --> 00:47:40.490
Captain made his bullet count, Sarge

588
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.414
Oh Jesus...

589
00:47:48.615 --> 00:47:55.463
No, no! No,
what's the matter with this place?


590
00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:58.591
Where's...where's the army?

591
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:11.187
Got any words for us now, Archbishop?

592
00:49:11.239 --> 00:49:14.792
Sergeant Tate,
are we spending another night here?


593
00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:18.588
Is that a good idea?

594
00:49:19.414 --> 00:49:20.923
It's up to the Captain

595
00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:24.594
But what would you do?

596
00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:26.637
Stay here?

597
00:49:28.965 --> 00:49:32.435
There's something wrong
with this place, isn't there?


598
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.395
Something not right

599
00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:37.097
Look what the Captain did

600
00:49:37.098 --> 00:49:38.691
What happened to Starinski?

601
00:49:39.184 --> 00:49:41.004
I don't know what you're talking about

602
00:49:42.103 --> 00:49:43.488
But the...

603
00:49:46.024 --> 00:49:47.408
You heard it

604
00:49:47.442 --> 00:49:48.785
I heard nothing

605
00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:50.486
Well what about the noise?

606
00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:52.455
I heard nothing

607
00:49:52.655 --> 00:49:54.791
What did you hear, eh?

608
00:49:55.658 --> 00:49:56.876
You

609
00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:01.339
You

610
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:12.141
But the prisoner. What he said.
He said we'd turn on each other


611
00:50:12.759 --> 00:50:14.468
What are we gonna do.
I mean we can't just...


612
00:50:14.469 --> 00:50:15.853
Shut up!

613
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.109
Just...just shut up with your questions

614
00:50:21.476 --> 00:50:23.611
He's the Captain, not me

615
00:50:24.479 --> 00:50:25.822
Ask him

616
00:50:29.776 --> 00:50:31.744
Shakespeare, Shakespeare

617
00:50:32.487 --> 00:50:33.788
Come here

618
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.129
We should leave right now

619
00:50:41.287 --> 00:50:44.998
Two men dead. Do you want
to add to that, Shakespeare, huh?


620
00:50:44.999 --> 00:50:46.300
Do ya?

621
00:50:48.503 --> 00:50:52.515
The Captain says we hold this trench.
So we're gonna sit tight


622
00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:54.934
You're gonna sit tight

623
00:50:56.177 --> 00:50:57.728
You understand?

624
00:51:38.678 --> 00:51:41.272
Little Hun bastards

625
00:51:43.683 --> 00:51:46.360
What have you been doin' here, eh?

626
00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:30.113
Jesus Christ, Bradford

627
00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:33.449
This place is scary enough
without you jumping out at me


628
00:52:39.614 --> 00:52:40.832
Are you alright?

629
00:52:43.785 --> 00:52:44.993
Good

630
00:52:44.994 --> 00:52:46.838
You take over, 
I'm gonna get some kip

631
00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:35.178
(COME HERE PLEASE)

632
00:53:35.837 --> 00:53:38.389
(DON'T LEAVE ME HERE TO DIE)

633
00:53:40.008 --> 00:53:41.809
Right Bradford, I'm here

634
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.731
Bradford?

635
00:53:58.193 --> 00:54:00.369
Well that's just fuckin' great

636
00:55:14.519 --> 00:55:16.395
Have you come for me, have you?

637
00:55:16.396 --> 00:55:17.780
Come on then

638
00:55:18.523 --> 00:55:21.033
Is this my time, huh?

639
00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:25.163
Well bring it at me.
You're gonna fuckin' need it


640
00:56:27.967 --> 00:56:30.144
No!

641
00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:49.905
What the fuck happened to you,
you stupid Scottish bastard?


642
00:56:49.906 --> 00:56:51.290
You alright, McNess?

643
00:56:51.658 --> 00:56:53.292
Come on, let me have a look

644
00:56:55.328 --> 00:56:56.546
Wait!

645
00:56:58.581 --> 00:56:59.748
McNess, what are you doing?

646
00:56:59.749 --> 00:57:00.707
Leaving!

647
00:57:00.708 --> 00:57:03.136
Well that's the best idea
I've heard all day


648
00:57:03.878 --> 00:57:06.889
McNess, you can't leave. You know that

649
00:57:07.632 --> 00:57:10.676
Look we'll dig in.
Build a strong defensive position


650
00:57:10.677 --> 00:57:16.274
Defensive position? What are we
defending against Sergeant, huh? What?


651
00:57:16.891 --> 00:57:19.560
Come on say it. Evil!

652
00:57:19.561 --> 00:57:22.062
Will you listen to yourself. Evil!

653
00:57:22.063 --> 00:57:24.731
It's the gas,
we are hallucinating, that is all


654
00:57:24.732 --> 00:57:26.733
Was Starinski hallucinating, huh?

655
00:57:26.734 --> 00:57:28.569
Is this a fuckin' hallucination?

656
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.737
There must be another sniper

657
00:57:30.738 --> 00:57:32.999
Germans we haven't found yet

658
00:57:33.366 --> 00:57:34.658
I don't know

659
00:57:34.659 --> 00:57:38.537
Aye I know you don't know.
You don't know because you won't admit it


660
00:57:38.538 --> 00:57:40.339
Fucking none of you

661
00:57:40.748 --> 00:57:42.508
I don't...I don't wanna die

662
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:45.169
I'm not waiting to die

663
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:47.004
Mcness, please don't go out there

664
00:57:47.005 --> 00:57:51.142
There's nothing out there. It's in here

665
00:57:51.468 --> 00:57:53.603
It's in fuckin' here

666
00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:57.398
Where do you think you're going?

667
00:57:58.641 --> 00:58:00.276
Deserters will be shot

668
00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:15.416
What would your father say
if he saw you now?


669
00:58:16.743 --> 00:58:18.419
He'd say naughty boy

670
00:58:18.953 --> 00:58:21.547
'Naughty boy' pointing weapons at people

671
00:58:22.624 --> 00:58:26.052
I'll put you over my knee and
I'll give you a damn good thrashing


672
00:58:26.461 --> 00:58:28.221
That's what he'd say

673
00:58:30.048 --> 00:58:31.724
Give me the gun Captain

674
00:58:37.305 --> 00:58:38.731
Give me the gun

675
00:58:51.402 --> 00:58:53.654
Remember your fuckin' manners

676
00:58:53.655 --> 00:58:55.531
Remember your fuckin' manners

677
00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:58.960
Don't forget your fuckin' manners

678
00:59:02.247 --> 00:59:04.048
You are under arrest

679
00:59:04.290 --> 00:59:05.591
Mcness!

680
00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.311
I don't see him

681
00:59:26.312 --> 00:59:27.613
Right, hold on

682
00:59:35.697 --> 00:59:36.956
Got him

683
00:59:53.381 --> 00:59:54.807
Bradford!

684
01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:02.774
Jesus, Bradford

685
01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:07.728
He's been hit

686
01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.405
Where did the shot come from?

687
01:00:10.231 --> 01:00:11.023
I'd better go and get him

688
01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:12.941
No, I'll get him. You cover me

689
01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:13.692
Alright

690
01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:16.370
Remember, just keep on the move

691
01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:19.707
Right, go!

692
01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:00.415
Bradford?

693
01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:09.257
Bradford!

694
01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.815
Bradford!

695
01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:33.448
Bradford!

696
01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:44.667
Bradford

697
01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:47.336
Come out!

698
01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.007
Now!

699
01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:07.940
Bradford!

700
01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:11.110
Bradford are you down here?

701
01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.836
McNess!

702
01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.838
McNess!

703
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.248
Doc!

704
01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.041
Oh fuck

705
01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:34.958
McNess!

706
01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:38.888
I can't move I've been shot

707
01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:40.515
Doc!

708
01:02:42.383 --> 01:02:43.050
Doc!

709
01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:44.218
It's okay, mate

710
01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:46.261
Help me, oh help me God

711
01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:47.805
I'm coming, I'm coming

712
01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:49.148
Doc!

713
01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:17.844
Hello Charlie

714
01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:26.561
Why did you shoot him?

715
01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:28.104
He was trying to leave

716
01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:30.815
We have to stay

717
01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:37.989
I'm a mess, man. Doc!

718
01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.576
I'm coming!

719
01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:44.570
I'm coming I'm...

720
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:45.872
Oh, God

721
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:51.711
Look at me

722
01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:58.876
Take out, take out your field dressing

723
01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:00.303
Look at me!

724
01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:02.889
Look at me!

725
01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:13.149
Hold on, McNess!

726
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:21.741
Hold on, McNess! Hold on McNess!
Hold on, McNess! Hold on to me! McNess!


727
01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:41.094
What's happened to you, Bradford?

728
01:04:41.669 --> 01:04:45.973
It's inside me, Charley. I can feel it

729
01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:49.843
It's moving around like worms in my gut,

730
01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:51.229
I can't stop it

731
01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:52.480
What?

732
01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.056
What is it?

733
01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.441
It's death!

734
01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.236
And it's waiting for us

735
01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:03.491
All this blame, this hatred...

736
01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.831
Come on, Bradford. 
Come back with me

737
01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:13.242
It's in the earth, and the rats,

738
01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:16.129
and the flies, and you and me

739
01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:21.342
We're dead, Charley. 
I know that now

740
01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.638
I can't feel my heart beating anymore

741
01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:31.144
I died here, and
I just didn't realise it

742
01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:34.981
Come on. Come back with me

743
01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.608
No. You have to stop me

744
01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:40.153
I'm not a murderer

745
01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:42.780
You will be

746
01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:49.704
I was wrong, you see. God is dead

747
01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:51.539
We're all alone

748
01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:54.459
Bradford

749
01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:59.422
Bradford! Where are we?

750
01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:07.346
Tate, barricades won't work.
It didn't help the Germans


751
01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:10.516
That thing out there took McNess

752
01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:13.594
Right in front of my eyes,
sucked him into the fuckin' mud


753
01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:16.054
So what are we gonna do.
Hide round some boxes?


754
01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:17.607
Captain

755
01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.818
Captain we need a hand here

756
01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.081
Halt! Who's there?

757
01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:35.583
It's me!

758
01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:37.710
It's me

759
01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.254
Shakespeare, where the hell have you been?

760
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:41.663
Come give us a hand, will ya?

761
01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:42.965
Sarge

762
01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:53.518
Bradford shot McNess

763
01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.395
I saw him do it

764
01:06:57.764 --> 01:06:59.941
He shot his own man

765
01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:04.695
That's not gonna do us any good, Sergeant

766
01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:06.948
Not against what's in here

767
01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:11.494
I'm a soldier, son. I fight
what I can see. What's in front of me


768
01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:16.249
But it's not in front of us.
Don't you understand that yet?


769
01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.126
Look, you're not listening

770
01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.244
You're meant to be in charge

771
01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:22.046
Just listen to him

772
01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:27.260
Oi! Hun! Hun!

773
01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.472
You wanna kill me?

774
01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.101
Well come on then

775
01:07:35.426 --> 01:07:38.187
Come on, come on then!

776
01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:42.275
I'm waiting

777
01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.382
Where do you think you're going?

778
01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:16.675
I can't let Quinn kill the prisoner

779
01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:17.217
You mad?

780
01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:20.813
Shakespeare, you don't fight
your own men to save the enemy


781
01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:22.982
But he's not the enemy

782
01:08:23.141 --> 01:08:26.486
Look we can't let this go on,
not in this place


783
01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:30.865
Please...

784
01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.493
Alright, I'll bring him back myself

785
01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.412
Out my way, Doc

786
01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:41.167
Sergeant Tate?

787
01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:42.117
Sir

788
01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.003
Muster the men, please

789
01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:46.288
Sir

790
01:08:46.289 --> 01:08:49.509
For inspection,
muster the company if you would


791
01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.344
What about Quinn?

792
01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.348
There's no company left, sir

793
01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:56.715
Nothing to inspect

794
01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:57.883
Just follow your orders

795
01:08:57.884 --> 01:08:58.926
Oh, for God's sake, man...

796
01:08:58.927 --> 01:08:59.802
Carry out my orders!

797
01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:01.187
This is not the time

798
01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:08.486
You are a weak man Sergeant Tate.
I've always thought that of you


799
01:09:08.561 --> 01:09:11.864
And you are a streak of posh,
fucking piss sir


800
01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:17.694
Captain, no!

801
01:09:17.695 --> 01:09:20.248
You are relieved of your duties

802
01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.161
Private First Class Shakespeare,
falling in for inspection, sir


803
01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:28.631
Corporal Fairweather falling in
for inspection, sir


804
01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:32.301
You are relieved of your duties

805
01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.761
Very good

806
01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:40.509
Doesn't do to let standards slip, Corporal

807
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.302
You have a responsibility
to these young men


808
01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:43.604
Yes, sir

809
01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:48.860
What is that godawful racket?

810
01:09:49.811 --> 01:09:51.612
That's Private Quinn, sir

811
01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:55.074
And why is he not here for inspection?

812
01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:56.951
Sergeant!

813
01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:01.831
Why is Private Quinn
not here for inspection?


814
01:10:03.992 --> 01:10:07.545
Right. Well done men, you fall out

815
01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.329
I'm going to go and
have a word with Private Quinn


816
01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:11.165
Please, don't do that, sir

817
01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:12.508
He'll kill you, sir

818
01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.094
I'm an officer

819
01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:34.447
Quinn!

820
01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.284
What do you think you're doing?

821
01:10:40.195 --> 01:10:44.499
Take that man down and get back
to the trench for inspection, now


822
01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.219
And?

823
01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:00.681
Take your hands off me

824
01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:05.478
You know what I hate most
about this fuckin' war?


825
01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:08.481
It's not the mud...

826
01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:11.567
...or the cold...

827
01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:21.452
...or the wet...

828
01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:29.293
Sarge?

829
01:11:30.245 --> 01:11:33.381
Or even the Hun...

830
01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:44.842
What have I done?

831
01:11:44.843 --> 01:11:47.311
It's the fucking officers

832
01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:54.068
Sarge!

833
01:11:56.563 --> 01:11:58.072
Make your peace

834
01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:05.121
Quinn! No!

835
01:12:06.698 --> 01:12:08.416
Quinn!

836
01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:20.178
Quinn!

837
01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:35.976
You ain't come to
arrest me again have ya?

838
01:12:35.977 --> 01:12:40.406
I'm not gonna arrest you, Quinn.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill ya


839
01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:44.827
Oh good, it's about time
you showed some fuckin' bollocks


840
01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:17.568
Charley! Charley!

841
01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.530
It's too late, you can't do anything

842
01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:30.581
It wasn't the Hun killed McNess,
it was Bradford


843
01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:32.875
That makes sense,

844
01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:35.202
the Bible basher losing it out here

845
01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:36.879
You don't see it, do ya?

846
01:13:37.205 --> 01:13:39.424
This place is making us kill each other

847
01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:44.670
There's nothing making me kill you

848
01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:49.225
Quinn, Quinn, don't do it!
It's wrong, you can't do it


849
01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:53.062
Quinn? Quinn!

850
01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:57.266
Quinn! Don't do it, please!

851
01:13:57.267 --> 01:13:59.527
It's a bit late for heroics ain't it?

852
01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:07.368
Quinn, there's been enough killing

853
01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:11.497
Not yet there hasn't

854
01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:18.838
Quinn, I've got...
I've got children

855
01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.600
No!

856
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.271
You murderer!

857
01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:39.442
You're just a fuckin' animal!

858
01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:52.413
Well go on. Go on

859
01:14:56.451 --> 01:14:58.503
You haven't got the guts have you?

860
01:14:58.953 --> 01:15:00.379
You're a coward

861
01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.790
You left him to die before

862
01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:04.792
Do you think nobody saw you run away?

863
01:15:04.793 --> 01:15:06.552
We all did!

864
01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.055
You should be shot!

865
01:15:09.964 --> 01:15:13.217
You should curl up into a little ball...

866
01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:15.093
...and shrivel up with shame

867
01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:16.720
At least I'm not a murderer

868
01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:21.150
That's all we do here.
This war is all murder


869
01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:23.069
And do you know what?

870
01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:25.530
I love it

871
01:15:28.233 --> 01:15:29.659
You're a coward

872
01:16:07.439 --> 01:16:08.573
Shoot!

873
01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:21.201
Fuck it!

874
01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:25.006
Charlie

875
01:16:49.314 --> 01:16:51.324
(THANK YOU. OKAY)

876
01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:52.992
(OKAY)

877
01:16:56.738 --> 01:16:58.581
(WE HAVE TO GO IMMEDIATELY)

878
01:16:58.740 --> 01:16:59.957
We are goin'

879
01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.127
I'm not gonna leave them behind

880
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.287
(THEY'RE DEAD)

881
01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:09.291
No. No, they're not

882
01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:11.928
(PLEASE GIVE ME M Y GUN)

883
01:17:18.927 --> 01:17:23.523
Take this. If I don't come back,
you get out of here


884
01:17:24.766 --> 01:17:27.402
(PLEASE GIVE IT TO ME)

885
01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:29.570
(THANK YOU)

886
01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:35.868
(BE CAREFUL OVER THERE.
GOOD B YE M Y FRIEND)


887
01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:41.582
Doc!

888
01:17:43.076 --> 01:17:44.544
Doc, where are you?

889
01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:52.385
Hello Chevasse

890
01:17:53.503 --> 01:17:54.846
What's happening?

891
01:17:58.466 --> 01:18:00.184
I'm gonna get you out of here

892
01:18:01.136 --> 01:18:06.149
I've had terrible dreams. Terrible

893
01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:07.942
Where's Doc?

894
01:18:07.976 --> 01:18:09.861
I'm going to go and find him now

895
01:18:10.228 --> 01:18:11.821
I'll be back very soon

896
01:18:17.152 --> 01:18:18.661
You can move your legs again?

897
01:18:19.654 --> 01:18:21.155
That's a good sign

898
01:18:21.156 --> 01:18:22.457
I'm trying

899
01:18:22.991 --> 01:18:25.001
I'll be back on my feet soon enough

900
01:18:28.163 --> 01:18:32.091
Can I have a little water,
if you don't mind?


901
01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.427
Of course

902
01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:51.602
What's wrong? Charley?

903
01:18:51.603 --> 01:18:52.186
Oh God

904
01:18:52.187 --> 01:18:53.446
What's wrong?

905
01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:15.542
No!

906
01:19:15.543 --> 01:19:18.796
I'm gonna help you, Chevasse.
I'm gonna get you out of here, I promise


907
01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:19.838
It's gonna be alright

908
01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:21.340
It's gonna be alright, just calm down

909
01:19:21.341 --> 01:19:23.342
Please just calm down. Please

910
01:19:23.343 --> 01:19:23.926
No!

911
01:19:23.927 --> 01:19:26.220
It's gonna be alright.
Please, please calm down


912
01:19:26.221 --> 01:19:27.554
No, help me, Charley!

913
01:19:27.555 --> 01:19:31.067
Help me! Help me Charley

914
01:19:32.227 --> 01:19:33.310
Help me!

915
01:19:33.311 --> 01:19:34.320
Help me

916
01:19:35.146 --> 01:19:36.572
I'm sorry, Chevasse

917
01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:04.642
What are you doing, Bradford?
Why are you doing this?


918
01:20:05.385 --> 01:20:06.635
Is it because of me?

919
01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:09.012
Because I don't believe?
I do believe, I swear to God


920
01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:10.064
Liar!

921
01:20:15.395 --> 01:20:17.530
Everyone loses it in this war

922
01:20:18.064 --> 01:20:20.023
It's just what it does to you

923
01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:24.278
But we're getting it back.
Bradford we'll get you back


924
01:20:24.279 --> 01:20:28.166
We'll put you on leave.
We'll sort, well sort you out


925
01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:39.469
Doc!

926
01:20:46.134 --> 01:20:47.560
Think of your faith

927
01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:51.981
What it means to you. Please

928
01:20:52.807 --> 01:20:56.736
What about forgiveness,
or redemption, or mercy?


929
01:20:58.271 --> 01:21:01.190
Be not overcome by evil
but overcome evil. With good...


930
01:21:01.191 --> 01:21:02.992
Corinthians, chapter twelve

931
01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:05.244
It's Romans twelve!

932
01:21:06.279 --> 01:21:09.499
So your actually gonna kill us all.
Is that it?


933
01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:12.251
Your just gonna blow us
all to hell and for what?


934
01:21:12.452 --> 01:21:13.878
So what?

935
01:21:21.628 --> 01:21:24.263
There is no victory, Bradford

936
01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:26.641
Not here, not anymore

937
01:21:29.761 --> 01:21:33.439
Please Bradford. 
There's no victory

938
01:21:34.599 --> 01:21:36.609
You don't win anything

939
01:21:37.852 --> 01:21:40.113
Shakespeare's coming to save you

940
01:21:41.606 --> 01:21:43.950
Do you think you deserve to be saved?

941
01:21:45.819 --> 01:21:47.120
I think so

942
01:21:49.697 --> 01:21:53.126
Oh, thank God. 
Charley, where's Tate?

943
01:21:57.539 --> 01:21:58.673
Don't

944
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.468
Doc, you're coming with me

945
01:22:04.546 --> 01:22:10.759
Bradford, just...Look

946
01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.052
you don't want to do this

947
01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:14.638
I told you you'd have to kill me
Charley, but you didn't listen


948
01:22:14.639 --> 01:22:15.639
I won't do it

949
01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.558
Yes! You will

950
01:22:17.559 --> 01:22:18.985
Shoot him!

951
01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.395
Stop me, Charley. 
I can't fight it anymore

952
01:22:21.396 --> 01:22:24.731
Bradford please, whatever it is
inside you, please just fight it


953
01:22:24.732 --> 01:22:25.566
I can't!

954
01:22:25.567 --> 01:22:26.775
Charley, shoot him!

955
01:22:26.776 --> 01:22:27.443
I won't

956
01:22:27.444 --> 01:22:28.569
Yes, you will!

957
01:22:28.570 --> 01:22:29.528
You have to!

958
01:22:29.529 --> 01:22:31.071
No more killing

959
01:22:31.072 --> 01:22:32.832
No, Bradford!

960
01:22:39.539 --> 01:22:40.747
Well done, Charley.
Now get me out of these


961
01:22:40.748 --> 01:22:41.883
Bradford

962
01:23:52.153 --> 01:23:53.121
No!

963
01:24:40.702 --> 01:24:42.628
No

964
01:25:46.559 --> 01:25:48.194
Turn around Charlie

965
01:25:56.486 --> 01:25:57.870
Where is this?

966
01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:06.879
Shakespeare

967
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:08.840
Sargeant?

968
01:26:18.716 --> 01:26:20.059
I'm not dead!

969
01:27:09.309 --> 01:27:10.568
I'm not dead!

970
01:27:12.187 --> 01:27:13.613
I'm not dead!

971
01:27:15.190 --> 01:27:16.783
I'm not dead!

972
01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:57.865
Allemand!

973
01:28:06.324 --> 01:28:07.750
Friedriech!

974
01:28:12.372 --> 01:28:13.881
Hey, Allemand?

975
01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:27.770
What are you doing?

976
01:28:40.942 --> 01:28:42.368
I saved you

977
01:28:49.784 --> 01:28:51.544
I tried to help you

978
01:28:52.787 --> 01:28:54.213
You did Charlie

979
01:28:55.623 --> 01:28:57.633
Only you tried to save me

980
01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:00.720
That is why you are free

981
01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:10.605
What's out there?

982
01:30:37.934 --> 01:30:39.485
Oh Jesus

983
01:30:41.729 --> 01:30:44.565
Sarge! I've got something over here

984
01:30:44.566 --> 01:30:48.286
Get your hands up. Now. 
You German bastard
