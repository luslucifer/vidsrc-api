Arnold house.

12
00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:33.982
David?

13
00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:35.150
Oh, hey Ava.

14
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:37.952
What are you up to?

15
00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:39.054
Just looking at--

16
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:42.257
Um, I'm just looking
at my card collection.


17
00:01:43.224 --> 00:01:44.325
<i>Cool.</i>

18
00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.793
Do you want
to come over


19
00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:47.062
and we can
look at them together?


20
00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:48.662
Um...

21
00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:51.199
I don't-
- I don't think

22
00:01:51.232 --> 00:01:53.068
that'd be
such a good idea right now.


23
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:55.236
<i>I mean, I'd like to,</i>
<i>but I just can't right now.</i>


24
00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.272
Are you not allowed
to stay out late again?


25
00:01:59.174 --> 00:02:02.243
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that's it.


26
00:02:02.277 --> 00:02:04.678
Well, I bet I can ask
my mom if you could stay over.


27
00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:07.248
-Mom.
-Uh, no.


28
00:02:07.282 --> 00:02:08.649
<i>No, it's okay.</i>

29
00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:09.817
<i>I'm pretty tired anyways.</i>

30
00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:12.920
Okay. Um...

31
00:02:14.222 --> 00:02:15.823
<i>what about tomorrow?</i>

32
00:02:16.857 --> 00:02:17.959
Maybe...

33
00:02:18.926 --> 00:02:19.994
noon?

34
00:02:21.162 --> 00:02:22.197
I'll be there.

35
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.931
Great.

36
00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.067
Good night, David.

37
00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:27.935
Good night, Ava.

38
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:39.114
Shh.

39
00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.187
...please, please, please!

40
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:47.688
David,
where is your brother?


41
00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:50.891
You got
what's coming to him next


42
00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:52.360
if you don't fucking
tell me where he is now!


43
00:02:52.393 --> 00:02:53.962
- Do not yell at him.
- Shut up, Dianne!


44
00:02:58.233 --> 00:02:59.666
What are you doing?

45
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.169
-Where is he?
-He's not in here.


46
00:03:01.202 --> 00:03:02.337
- Where is he?
- You're drunk


47
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.271
and you need
to calm down.


48
00:03:03.304 --> 00:03:04.372
He's not in here!

49
00:03:05.974 --> 00:03:07.342
Matthew?
No, no, no, no, no.


50
00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.809
Come on!

51
00:03:08.842 --> 00:03:10.411
Get out
from under there!


52
00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:11.346
Please, you're
going to hurt him, Matthew.


53
00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.913
Matthew, please.

54
00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:15.083
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, please, stop!


55
00:03:15.116 --> 00:03:17.418
The boy needs to learn
to respect his parents, huh?


56
00:03:17.452 --> 00:03:19.387
Going around school
telling parents and friends


57
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.422
that I'm a bad father, huh?

58
00:03:21.456 --> 00:03:23.324
What kind of son
does that, huh?


59
00:03:23.358 --> 00:03:25.293
- You're hurting him.
- Is that what family does?


60
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.396
I can't hear you, boy.

61
00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:29.763
Do you respect me now?

62
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.768
Oh, my God.

63
00:03:36.937 --> 00:03:38.739
No, no, no!
Matthew, careful!


64
00:03:38.772 --> 00:03:40.175
Please don't hurt him!

65
00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:42.410
I'll teach you.
Or you a big boy now?


66
00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:44.945
Oh, a big tough
man are ya? Huh?


67
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.448
Oh, David.

68
00:03:47.482 --> 00:03:49.816
Oh, David, no.

69
00:03:53.154 --> 00:03:54.855
That is it!

70
00:03:54.888 --> 00:03:57.058
Matthew! No!

71
00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:59.760
We are done!
We are through!


72
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:01.462
I want you out!

73
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.298
Is that
what you want?


74
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.435
Good.

75
00:04:07.468 --> 00:04:09.170
'Cause I don't care
about any of you!


76
00:04:09.204 --> 00:04:10.871
In fact,
I hate all of you!


77
00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:13.975
Is this what you want?
Is that what you want there?


78
00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:15.909
Here.
Take it. Take it.


79
00:04:21.382 --> 00:04:23.284
Oh my God, baby boy.

80
00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:25.186
I'm so sorry.

81
00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:29.424
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.


82
00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:32.859
Oh you mother fucker!

83
00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:35.729
I will kill you!
Get out of my house!


84
00:05:17.372 --> 00:05:19.040
So let me
get this straight.


85
00:05:19.073 --> 00:05:21.242
You're saying that
in a seven-game series,


86
00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:22.943
you wouldn't use
the same pitcher twice


87
00:05:22.977 --> 00:05:24.279
if he didn't
pitch well the first time?


88
00:05:26.947 --> 00:05:28.249
What?

89
00:05:28.283 --> 00:05:30.051
Doesn't who's pitching
matter to you?


90
00:05:30.084 --> 00:05:32.253
-Or is your answer the same?
-No, it doesn't matter.


91
00:05:32.287 --> 00:05:34.921
So, what, if Nichols ends up
losing this game for us--


92
00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:37.225
-Which he will.
-He shouldn't pitch


93
00:05:37.258 --> 00:05:38.859
the rest of the series?

94
00:05:38.892 --> 00:05:41.062
No, he had
his chance, he blew it.


95
00:05:41.562 --> 00:05:43.331
Move onto the next guy,
it's that simple.


96
00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:45.533
David,
it's game one of the series.


97
00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:47.568
The Majors
run a five-man rotation,


98
00:05:47.602 --> 00:05:50.571
and Nichols
is arguably our best pitcher.


99
00:05:50.972 --> 00:05:52.906
I don't know
what you want me to say, Jack.


100
00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.108
Hey guys.

101
00:05:54.142 --> 00:05:56.277
- Ava.
- What's up?


102
00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:58.012
- Question.
- Fire away.


103
00:05:58.046 --> 00:05:59.480
If your best pitcher

104
00:05:59.514 --> 00:06:01.983
is pitching
game one of a series


105
00:06:02.016 --> 00:06:04.419
and he doesn't do well
in his first game,


106
00:06:04.452 --> 00:06:06.487
do you use
him again in the series?


107
00:06:08.623 --> 00:06:09.923
Is he drunk?

108
00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:12.859
Are you even
old enough to be in here?


109
00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:14.529
Shh, I need you
to take this seriously.


110
00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:17.565
To put it simply...

111
00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:21.002
do you believe
in second chances?


112
00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.442
If it's deserved,
then yeah, why not?


113
00:06:27.475 --> 00:06:30.278
I think most people deserve
a second chance in life.


114
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:32.513
Finally,
someone agrees with me.


115
00:06:32.547 --> 00:06:34.349
'Cause David over here
doesn't think so.


116
00:06:34.382 --> 00:06:36.417
Oh, tough guy, eh?

117
00:06:39.454 --> 00:06:42.090
All right,
I'm going to take a leak.


118
00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:45.126
You two... reconnect.

119
00:06:53.534 --> 00:06:54.569
How are you?

120
00:06:55.703 --> 00:06:57.638
- Good. How are you?
- I'm good.


121
00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:00.108
How's your mom?

122
00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:03.144
Well,
she's seen better days.


123
00:07:03.177 --> 00:07:04.911
She's all right.

124
00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:07.448
We had dinner
before heading there.


125
00:07:07.482 --> 00:07:09.384
- No way, Dylan's there.
- Really?


126
00:07:09.417 --> 00:07:11.953
Yeah, he's at the game.
Did you guys see him?


127
00:07:11.986 --> 00:07:13.087
No,
we must have missed him.


128
00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:16.190
Anyway, uh, how is he?

129
00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:18.326
Dylan?
He's good.


130
00:07:18.359 --> 00:07:20.061
He starts
kindergarten soon.


131
00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:22.029
Here.

132
00:07:23.464 --> 00:07:24.699
Hoo.

133
00:07:24.732 --> 00:07:26.667
Yeah,
he's really excited


134
00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:28.169
for baseball to start up.

135
00:07:28.202 --> 00:07:30.071
Like, it's all
he's talking about.


136
00:07:30.104 --> 00:07:32.440
Yeah, sure. He gonna be good?

137
00:07:32.473 --> 00:07:35.143
Well,
maybe not as good as you,


138
00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:37.111
but, yeah,
I think he'll be good.


139
00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:39.280
He could learn
a thing or two about batting


140
00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:40.982
if I'm being
completely honest.


141
00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:44.051
It--

142
00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:46.320
Oh, no.

143
00:07:49.757 --> 00:07:51.325
What happened?

144
00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:54.495
Fucking...
Coach Daniels just texted me.


145
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:55.630
Oh?

146
00:07:57.632 --> 00:07:59.000
I got cut.

147
00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:03.971
- I'm sorry, Jack.
- Baseball?


148
00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:06.207
Oh, that sucks.

149
00:08:06.707 --> 00:08:08.009
Whatever.

150
00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:09.143
Can we go?

151
00:08:11.312 --> 00:08:12.413
Sure.

152
00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:17.418
Well, I guess--

153
00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:19.454
I guess
we're leaving.


154
00:08:26.427 --> 00:08:27.528
What?

155
00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:34.135
Here.

156
00:08:37.238 --> 00:08:39.040
Really?

157
00:08:39.073 --> 00:08:40.541
Oh, shit.

158
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.701
You know what?

159
00:09:06.734 --> 00:09:08.369
Screw Coach Daniels anyways.

160
00:09:08.402 --> 00:09:10.104
If he doesn't want me,

161
00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:11.706
then I don't want
to be on the team.


162
00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:14.175
Most Juniors don't make it
to varsity anyway.


163
00:09:14.675 --> 00:09:16.444
-You did.
-I worked for it.


164
00:09:16.477 --> 00:09:18.346
And what, I didn't?

165
00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:21.215
Jack, you spend all your time
inside playing video games.


166
00:09:21.249 --> 00:09:23.184
-What do you expect?
-I put in the work.


167
00:09:23.217 --> 00:09:24.619
You just never see me.

168
00:09:24.652 --> 00:09:26.220
I don't see you
'cause you don't practice.


169
00:09:26.254 --> 00:09:28.055
-Yes, I do.
-When?


170
00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:30.057
I worked my ass off
for that spot on the team!


171
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:31.792
Oh, and what
do you want me to do?


172
00:09:32.793 --> 00:09:34.128
Text Coach.

173
00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:35.796
And say what?

174
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.298
I'm your younger brother.

175
00:09:37.331 --> 00:09:38.599
I come
from the same genes as you!


176
00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:40.501
Tell him
to give me a spot on the team.


177
00:09:40.535 --> 00:09:41.702
I'm not
going to do that, Jack.


178
00:09:41.736 --> 00:09:43.304
Why not?
I'm telling you,


179
00:09:43.337 --> 00:09:44.739
I'm as good
as any player on that team.


180
00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:46.340
Coach just
has it out for me.


181
00:09:46.374 --> 00:09:47.775
If you set him straight,
I'll be running laps


182
00:09:47.808 --> 00:09:49.410
around those losers
by the end of the season.


183
00:09:49.443 --> 00:09:51.345
-Watch the road.
-The one time I ask you


184
00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:52.680
for a favor,
you let me down?


185
00:09:52.713 --> 00:09:54.482
You don't think
I'm good enough, do you?


186
00:09:54.515 --> 00:09:56.083
-Jackson, the road!
-What's a big brother for then?


187
00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:57.585
Aren't you supposed
to watch out for me?


188
00:09:57.618 --> 00:09:59.086
Pull over!

189
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.388
in control
of everything!


190
00:10:19.407 --> 00:10:20.775
He hit the pole.

191
00:10:50.938 --> 00:10:52.373
Are they okay?

192
00:10:56.243 --> 00:10:57.745
Everything all right?

193
00:11:03.517 --> 00:11:04.585
We gotta go!

194
00:11:05.219 --> 00:11:07.188
We gotta go, man.
Nobody saw anything.


195
00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:08.422
We could just go.

196
00:11:08.456 --> 00:11:09.757
The cops
will be here fast.


197
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.258
They'll be okay.
We gotta go!


198
00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:21.836
There's a kid?

199
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:23.904
It's Dylan.

200
00:11:24.739 --> 00:11:26.407
What?

201
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.942
It's Ava's kid.

202
00:11:27.976 --> 00:11:29.844
And that's his dad,
dead in the driver's seat.


203
00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:33.314
What--

204
00:11:33.814 --> 00:11:34.849
I can't--

205
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.418
The cops will come
with an ambulance.


206
00:11:37.451 --> 00:11:39.220
They'll be fine.

207
00:11:39.253 --> 00:11:40.655
We're faster,
we're closer to the hospital.


208
00:11:40.688 --> 00:11:42.323
We can get there
faster than they can get here.


209
00:11:42.356 --> 00:11:43.457
-David--
-Jackson!


210
00:13:41.742 --> 00:13:44.411
Hey, welcome home, baby.

211
00:13:56.657 --> 00:13:57.725
All right.

212
00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:05.800
Don't! Sit.
I got it.


213
00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:08.936
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


214
00:14:17.878 --> 00:14:19.446
I see you kept the car.

215
00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:26.021
Yeah, yeah,
what was I gonna do, sell it?


216
00:14:31.525 --> 00:14:32.626
Jack couldn't make it?

217
00:14:33.527 --> 00:14:35.896
Oh, I don't know
what your brother's doing.


218
00:14:36.463 --> 00:14:38.365
What do you mean?

219
00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:39.567
Well, he hasn't been around
to see me in months.


220
00:14:44.005 --> 00:14:45.406
Actually it's...

221
00:14:46.607 --> 00:14:47.908
probably been
about a year now.


222
00:14:49.476 --> 00:14:50.878
Now that I start
thinking about it.


223
00:14:54.849 --> 00:14:55.916
Well,
I'll go see him.


224
00:15:17.138 --> 00:15:18.539
Who is it?

225
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.442
It's me, Jackson.

226
00:15:22.676 --> 00:15:23.811
What do you want?

227
00:15:26.014 --> 00:15:27.082
I'm back.

228
00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:33.021
Do you want
to get lunch?


229
00:15:34.055 --> 00:15:35.991
Nah. Can't.

230
00:15:37.725 --> 00:15:38.994
Why?

231
00:15:39.027 --> 00:15:40.095
I'm busy.

232
00:15:41.729 --> 00:15:42.930
Jackson, open the door.

233
00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:44.099
I'm not
talking to you like this.


234
00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:48.702
You see me now.

235
00:15:50.005 --> 00:15:51.072
What do you want?

236
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.407
Hey.

237
00:15:57.845 --> 00:15:59.680
I'm heading for lunch.
Do you want to come?


238
00:16:00.514 --> 00:16:01.582
No.

239
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.717
Why not?

240
00:16:04.152 --> 00:16:05.452
-Busy.

241
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.992
I saw the
Chevelle's at home and...


242
00:16:11.592 --> 00:16:12.893
surprised
you didn't take it.


243
00:16:13.694 --> 00:16:15.462
You think Mom
would ever give it to me?


244
00:16:17.132 --> 00:16:19.600
Yeah. She says you hadn't
been around in a while.


245
00:16:20.601 --> 00:16:21.735
Why would I be?

246
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.570
Is something wrong?

247
00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:26.074
You tell me.

248
00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:49.630
You okay?

249
00:16:50.265 --> 00:16:51.832
I-- I got
an interview today.


250
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.834
Where?

251
00:16:53.867 --> 00:16:55.236
Well, I texted Coach.

252
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.837
I asked if I could
get a job doing something


253
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.006
at the field, you know?

254
00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:00.108
Maybe coaching.

255
00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:02.177
Hopefully coaching.

256
00:17:03.744 --> 00:17:04.945
That's great, honey.

257
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.588
Son,
how have you been?


258
00:17:14.621 --> 00:17:15.689
Good.

259
00:17:17.058 --> 00:17:18.193
How's the mom?

260
00:17:18.692 --> 00:17:20.694
She's all right.
Thanks for asking.


261
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.198
So...

262
00:17:23.231 --> 00:17:24.665
what can I do for you?

263
00:17:26.101 --> 00:17:28.303
Well, Coach, I need a--

264
00:17:28.336 --> 00:17:31.139
I-- I--
I want a job.


265
00:17:31.672 --> 00:17:33.874
You know, I'm thinking
I could make a great coach.


266
00:17:35.276 --> 00:17:37.979
David, it's mid-season.

267
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.681
We ain't got any jobs.

268
00:17:42.317 --> 00:17:43.684
And even if I did...

269
00:17:44.452 --> 00:17:46.887
would that really be
the best thing?


270
00:17:47.989 --> 00:17:50.791
Well, I've always been one
of your best players, you know,


271
00:17:50.824 --> 00:17:52.559
and I think I could make
an excellent addition


272
00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:53.827
to the coaching staff.

273
00:17:53.861 --> 00:17:55.230
You know, I know
a lot of players go


274
00:17:55.263 --> 00:17:57.165
-from player to coach--
-David. David.


275
00:17:58.665 --> 00:18:00.201
I'm not denying
your talent.


276
00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:01.902
Trust me.

277
00:18:03.338 --> 00:18:05.040
I just--

278
00:18:06.907 --> 00:18:08.642
I just can't
do it right now, son.


279
00:18:09.411 --> 00:18:11.712
The moms in these
leagues would kill me.


280
00:18:14.915 --> 00:18:16.117
Maybe next season,

281
00:18:16.151 --> 00:18:17.618
maybe some
father will drop out


282
00:18:17.651 --> 00:18:18.819
of coaching
a Little League team.


283
00:18:19.586 --> 00:18:22.090
And by that time,
the storm will blow over,


284
00:18:22.123 --> 00:18:24.059
and it'll be
an afterthought in your life.


285
00:18:25.826 --> 00:18:26.894
Yeah.

286
00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:31.966
Here. How's this.

287
00:18:34.235 --> 00:18:36.104
You know what?
You know what I got?


288
00:18:36.538 --> 00:18:39.606
I got this umpire gig
for a Little League division.


289
00:18:40.008 --> 00:18:42.210
The guy doing the job
doesn't show up on time.


290
00:18:45.313 --> 00:18:46.347
Hell.

291
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.816
You'd be
wearing a mask.


292
00:18:50.085 --> 00:18:51.852
It'd be a solution
for everyone.


293
00:18:52.886 --> 00:18:53.955
How does that sound?

294
00:19:04.731 --> 00:19:05.799
So...

295
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.969
how did it go?

296
00:19:10.305 --> 00:19:11.372
I got it.

297
00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.010
Oh, honey,
I'm so proud of you!


298
00:19:17.011 --> 00:19:18.079
What team?

299
00:19:19.114 --> 00:19:20.281
What?

300
00:19:20.315 --> 00:19:21.882
What team
are you coaching?


301
00:19:24.052 --> 00:19:26.887
Oh,
it's a Little League team.


302
00:19:29.157 --> 00:19:30.291
Good for you, David.

303
00:19:31.758 --> 00:19:32.860
Yeah.

304
00:19:36.431 --> 00:19:37.898
Look,
I'm going for a walk.


305
00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:39.766
Do you want to come?

306
00:19:56.451 --> 00:19:57.751
I just saw Jackson.

307
00:20:00.854 --> 00:20:01.922
And?

308
00:20:07.195 --> 00:20:09.097
Oh, honey,
he's-- he's just--


309
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.865
he hasn't recovered
from the accident...


310
00:20:12.967 --> 00:20:14.035
mentally.

311
00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:15.136
Mentally.

312
00:20:16.937 --> 00:20:18.805
I don't think
he ever will, to be honest.


313
00:20:19.407 --> 00:20:21.276
Most people handle
things differently.


314
00:20:25.013 --> 00:20:26.880
He was always
the emotional one, David.


315
00:20:26.914 --> 00:20:30.418
He will always have a bigger
and longer reaction to things.


316
00:20:36.324 --> 00:20:38.259
He's so grateful
for what you did for him.


317
00:20:40.495 --> 00:20:41.762
But he's just...

318
00:20:42.664 --> 00:20:45.699
he suffered in a much
different way than you did.


319
00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.042
One sec.

320
00:21:51.132 --> 00:21:52.200
David.

321
00:21:54.868 --> 00:21:55.936
What the hell was that?

322
00:21:56.738 --> 00:21:59.407
-Was that who I think it was?
-Yes, it was.


323
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.175
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?


324
00:22:01.609 --> 00:22:03.478
We remained
close over the years, David.


325
00:22:03.511 --> 00:22:05.246
We were family friends before
it happened, you know that.


326
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.880
So, what, you're--
you're best friends now?


327
00:22:06.913 --> 00:22:08.383
She's lonely, David.

328
00:22:08.416 --> 00:22:09.950
I help her
when she needs help.


329
00:22:11.519 --> 00:22:12.987
You help her?

330
00:22:13.488 --> 00:22:15.456
She's renovating the house.
I help her paint.


331
00:22:18.192 --> 00:22:19.961
Mom, do you know
what I did to them?


332
00:22:19.994 --> 00:22:21.029
No.

333
00:22:21.663 --> 00:22:23.498
She knows
what Jackson did to them.


334
00:22:26.567 --> 00:22:29.070
-David, she needed to know.
-We talked about this.


335
00:22:29.103 --> 00:22:30.371
That isn't
your place to do that.


336
00:22:30.405 --> 00:22:31.606
No, that's your place
to do that.


337
00:22:31.639 --> 00:22:33.041
No,
that isn't anyone's place!


338
00:22:33.074 --> 00:22:35.842
She's such
a good woman, David.


339
00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:37.345
And Dylan,
Dylan is such a good kid.


340
00:22:37.378 --> 00:22:39.380
He reminds me
so much of you.


341
00:22:39.414 --> 00:22:40.581
And I just think--

342
00:22:40.615 --> 00:22:42.550
I don't care!
I can't care!


343
00:22:47.388 --> 00:22:48.456
It's just--

344
00:22:49.057 --> 00:22:50.525
Why are you
doing this to me?


345
00:22:50.558 --> 00:22:52.360
It's like
a constant reminder--


346
00:22:52.393 --> 00:22:54.462
You won't have to deal
with it for much longer!


347
00:23:19.454 --> 00:23:20.555
I am going...

348
00:23:23.624 --> 00:23:25.326
I have something
I need to go and do.


349
00:23:26.394 --> 00:23:28.363
And I'd
appreciate it very much


350
00:23:28.396 --> 00:23:30.498
if when I see you
tomorrow morning...


351
00:23:31.966 --> 00:23:34.035
you don't have
the same attitude.


352
00:23:52.387 --> 00:23:53.454
<i>It was a kid?</i>

353
00:23:54.055 --> 00:23:55.356
<i>It's Dylan.</i>

354
00:23:57.191 --> 00:23:58.993
<i>It's Ava's kid.</i>

355
00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:48.976
Morning.

356
00:24:53.681 --> 00:24:56.150
Knocked over the clock.
Sorry if I woke you.


357
00:25:02.523 --> 00:25:03.591
I'm also...

358
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.695
sorry I overreacted yesterday.
I didn't...


359
00:25:09.464 --> 00:25:11.599
I didn't mean to yell at you.
I just...


360
00:25:21.375 --> 00:25:23.144
I found
this photo of us.


361
00:25:24.445 --> 00:25:26.981
Jackson, you, and me.

362
00:25:28.349 --> 00:25:29.484
I'd never
seen it before.


363
00:25:29.517 --> 00:25:31.085
I didn't even
know it existed.


364
00:25:34.188 --> 00:25:35.256
It's...

365
00:25:36.657 --> 00:25:38.092
look at--
look at that.


366
00:26:12.126 --> 00:26:13.761
Are we
waiting on anyone?


367
00:26:16.564 --> 00:26:17.765
No.

368
00:26:17.798 --> 00:26:19.534
Let's get started then,
shall we?


369
00:26:23.304 --> 00:26:24.438
Okay.

370
00:26:29.544 --> 00:26:31.779
This seems
pretty straightforward.


371
00:26:31.812 --> 00:26:34.815
"All my belongings
I leave to David Arnold,


372
00:26:34.849 --> 00:26:36.284
my eldest son."

373
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.788
Wait, hold on.

374
00:26:42.757 --> 00:26:44.859
Seems
we have one more.


375
00:26:44.892 --> 00:26:47.562
She made a final update
to her will a few days ago.


376
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.666
"There's a present
in my bedroom closet


377
00:26:51.699 --> 00:26:54.468
which will be left
to Ava Williams's son,


378
00:26:54.502 --> 00:26:56.103
Dylan Williams.

379
00:26:56.137 --> 00:26:59.507
It is to be given
to Dylan by my son David."


380
00:29:01.362 --> 00:29:02.496
David.

381
00:29:04.032 --> 00:29:05.466
I didn't know
you were home.


382
00:29:07.435 --> 00:29:08.502
I am.

383
00:29:11.739 --> 00:29:13.507
I'm sorry
about your mom.


384
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.648
So?

385
00:29:22.349 --> 00:29:25.653
Um, mom left Dylan
a present before she, uh...


386
00:29:25.686 --> 00:29:27.455
What is it?

387
00:29:27.488 --> 00:29:28.856
I don't know.
I didn't open it.


388
00:29:28.889 --> 00:29:31.492
Dylan. Come here.

389
00:29:35.563 --> 00:29:37.932
This is a gift
from Auntie Dianne.


390
00:29:38.632 --> 00:29:40.701
This is Auntie
Dianne's son, David.


391
00:29:40.735 --> 00:29:42.570
We used to be friends
when we were your age.


392
00:29:44.438 --> 00:29:45.539
Hello, Mister.

393
00:29:51.645 --> 00:29:52.680
All right.

394
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.515
Thank you.

395
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:56.684
Look, Mom!

396
00:29:56.717 --> 00:29:59.920
Oh! Wow.

397
00:29:59.955 --> 00:30:01.388
That's my glove.

398
00:30:01.422 --> 00:30:02.857
Sorry?

399
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.625
It-- it was my glove
when I was Dylan's age.


400
00:30:05.926 --> 00:30:07.728
- Oh.
- No, no. Keep it.


401
00:30:07.762 --> 00:30:09.897
I didn't--
I didn't know she held onto it.


402
00:30:11.465 --> 00:30:12.767
It's good,
it'll go to good use.


403
00:30:14.069 --> 00:30:16.004
Okay, sweetheart,
what do you say?


404
00:30:16.037 --> 00:30:18.339
Thank you, Mister.

405
00:30:18.372 --> 00:30:20.075
Dylan left his last glove
out in the rain,


406
00:30:20.108 --> 00:30:22.810
so I guess this saves us
from getting a new one, huh?


407
00:30:22.843 --> 00:30:23.911
You play baseball?

408
00:30:24.411 --> 00:30:27.448
Yup and I'm going to be
the best player ever.


409
00:30:28.949 --> 00:30:31.285
Okay, go grab your ball.
We'll play catch after lunch.


410
00:30:35.923 --> 00:30:38.926
All right.
Thank you, David. Here.


411
00:30:46.734 --> 00:30:48.469
You teach it now?

412
00:30:48.502 --> 00:30:50.471
Yeah.

413
00:30:50.504 --> 00:30:52.907
I teach a night class to people
who want to learn how to paint.


414
00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:56.443
It's mostly old people,
but, you know, I enjoy it.


415
00:30:57.812 --> 00:30:59.613
I teach with Jessica
from high school.


416
00:31:00.148 --> 00:31:02.050
-Remember her?
-Yeah.


417
00:31:03.717 --> 00:31:05.886
So, yeah, I don't know
why I gave you that,


418
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.888
but my number
is on the front.


419
00:31:08.256 --> 00:31:11.559
If you ever find anything
of ours at your mother's place.


420
00:31:12.793 --> 00:31:13.861
You were over?

421
00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:15.964
Yeah.

422
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.099
Often, actually.

423
00:31:23.871 --> 00:31:25.106
I'll see you
at the funeral.


424
00:31:27.075 --> 00:31:28.342
You're coming?

425
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:30.778
If that's okay.

426
00:31:35.016 --> 00:31:36.084
See ya there.

427
00:32:03.178 --> 00:32:04.745
<i>You've reached Jackson.</i>

428
00:32:04.778 --> 00:32:06.614
<i>I'll get back</i>
<i>to you when I do.</i>


429
00:32:08.515 --> 00:32:10.384
Hey, Jackson, it's me.

430
00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:12.020
Um...

431
00:32:14.588 --> 00:32:16.157
funeral's tomorrow.

432
00:32:16.191 --> 00:32:19.660
Wondering if maybe you
could drive me, since I can't?


433
00:32:21.662 --> 00:32:23.198
I don't know,
maybe you could, um,


434
00:32:23.231 --> 00:32:24.932
take a bus over

435
00:32:24.966 --> 00:32:26.767
and you could drive
Dad's car if you wanted to?


436
00:32:28.103 --> 00:32:29.403
Um...

437
00:32:31.172 --> 00:32:33.507
anyway,
uh, let me know.


438
00:33:34.235 --> 00:33:36.137
-David.
-No.


439
00:33:36.171 --> 00:33:37.705
-David, wait.
-Walk away.


440
00:33:38.239 --> 00:33:39.707
David, why won't you
talk to me, please?


441
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.941
I've got nothing
to say to you!


442
00:33:40.976 --> 00:33:42.010
I can't imagine
you have anything


443
00:33:42.043 --> 00:33:43.211
- to say--
- David.


444
00:33:53.854 --> 00:33:55.957
Hi Ava.
Nice to see you.


445
00:33:57.591 --> 00:33:58.692
Hey, Matthew.

446
00:34:01.997 --> 00:34:03.098
David.

447
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.067
David.

448
00:34:07.002 --> 00:34:08.069
I'm sober.

449
00:34:15.176 --> 00:34:16.777
Go, please.

450
00:34:39.767 --> 00:34:40.834
You okay?

451
00:34:43.104 --> 00:34:44.172
I'm fine.

452
00:34:50.911 --> 00:34:52.013
Pull over.

453
00:34:52.047 --> 00:34:53.114
What?

454
00:34:53.148 --> 00:34:54.215
Please.

455
00:34:54.915 --> 00:34:55.984
Fuck.

456
00:35:02.689 --> 00:35:03.958
Where are you going?

457
00:35:03.992 --> 00:35:06.094
Thanks for the ride, Ava.
I don't need it.


458
00:35:06.127 --> 00:35:07.628
It's okay, David.

459
00:35:07.661 --> 00:35:08.829
I know
what you're going through.


460
00:35:08.862 --> 00:35:09.897
You have no clue.

461
00:35:10.999 --> 00:35:12.566
You don't think
I know, huh?


462
00:35:14.701 --> 00:35:17.972
You don't think I've been
in this exact same spot?


463
00:35:18.672 --> 00:35:22.043
I know exactly
what you're going through.


464
00:35:22.077 --> 00:35:24.745
And if you give it any leeway,
David, it'll kill you.


465
00:35:24.778 --> 00:35:26.147
It'll fucking kill you!

466
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.203
Look.

467
00:35:48.236 --> 00:35:50.105
I forgot about that.

468
00:35:50.138 --> 00:35:52.639
I found it while I was going
through some of my old stuff.


469
00:35:53.975 --> 00:35:56.344
That's crazy to think
we went to prom together.


470
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.912
Or the first
part of prom, anyway.


471
00:36:01.382 --> 00:36:04.052
It must have been

472
00:36:04.852 --> 00:36:06.221
I'll always remember

473
00:36:06.254 --> 00:36:08.356
prom was on the same day
as Dylan's birthday.


474
00:36:12.393 --> 00:36:13.694
Does he know?

475
00:36:16.998 --> 00:36:18.066
No.

476
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.667
He doesn't.

477
00:36:23.171 --> 00:36:25.306
He remembers
something happened, but...


478
00:36:26.407 --> 00:36:27.841
he doesn't know what.

479
00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:29.910
And I'd like
to keep it that way.


480
00:36:32.746 --> 00:36:34.848
He doesn't remember
anything about his father.


481
00:36:34.882 --> 00:36:36.117
And I know
he's curious.


482
00:36:38.253 --> 00:36:39.820
But he's just
not ready yet.


483
00:36:46.161 --> 00:36:47.694
I remember
when I first went in.


484
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:51.099
My mom
would visit every Monday.


485
00:36:53.468 --> 00:36:54.969
She'd visit me
every Monday


486
00:36:55.003 --> 00:36:56.803
for the first four
years I was there,


487
00:36:56.837 --> 00:36:58.939
and she'd come with that week's
update on the Majors.


488
00:37:02.709 --> 00:37:04.912
I swear,
she went to every game.


489
00:37:04.945 --> 00:37:07.248
She knew all the players,
how they played,


490
00:37:07.282 --> 00:37:09.883
even all their places
in the standings.


491
00:37:10.851 --> 00:37:12.387
She was
a great woman.


492
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.988
Yeah, but that's the thing.
She didn't like baseball.


493
00:37:14.355 --> 00:37:15.722
- I thought she did.
- No.


494
00:37:16.157 --> 00:37:17.791
Well,
my dad liked baseball.


495
00:37:17.824 --> 00:37:19.394
She didn't-- she
didn't really care much for it.


496
00:37:20.361 --> 00:37:22.964
Of course she came
to my games when I was a kid.


497
00:37:22.997 --> 00:37:24.831
Jackson and my dad
did too, but...


498
00:37:26.167 --> 00:37:28.069
She'd never go to a game
that didn't involve us.


499
00:37:28.102 --> 00:37:29.170
She said
it was too boring.


500
00:37:33.907 --> 00:37:37.312
Jackson and I went
to every Majors game we could.


501
00:37:37.345 --> 00:37:38.946
We were
their biggest fans.


502
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.049
Absolute die hards.

503
00:37:41.683 --> 00:37:43.418
And since
I couldn't go anymore...


504
00:37:44.519 --> 00:37:45.786
she'd go for me.

505
00:37:47.288 --> 00:37:49.157
She'd take
multiple nights off each week


506
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.458
just to go
to baseball games


507
00:37:50.491 --> 00:37:51.825
that she didn't
give a shit about.


508
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.229
Just as an excuse

509
00:37:54.262 --> 00:37:56.097
to be able to talk to me
about something on Monday.


510
00:38:00.834 --> 00:38:02.303
Ended up
watching the games anyway.


511
00:38:03.937 --> 00:38:06.207
I think she didn't think
we had TV in there,


512
00:38:06.241 --> 00:38:08.009
but I never told her.

513
00:38:08.977 --> 00:38:11.079
I just kind of liked hearing
her explain it, you know?


514
00:38:13.114 --> 00:38:14.983
She'd come every Monday
and give me the rundown


515
00:38:15.016 --> 00:38:16.384
on what happened
in each game and...


516
00:38:22.957 --> 00:38:24.025
that's my mom.

517
00:38:51.953 --> 00:38:53.021
You holding up?

518
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:57.891
Oh yeah, man.

519
00:38:57.924 --> 00:38:59.193
Holding up so good.

520
00:39:00.962 --> 00:39:02.497
You want
to talk about it?


521
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.533
Older bro checking up on
his younger, troubled brother.


522
00:39:05.967 --> 00:39:07.801
-So touching.
-Yeah, where have you been?


523
00:39:08.536 --> 00:39:11.239
I've been busy getting
none of Mom's inheritance.


524
00:39:11.272 --> 00:39:12.373
Who told you that?

525
00:39:12.407 --> 00:39:13.474
No one.

526
00:39:14.509 --> 00:39:16.177
That's how I knew.

527
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.146
No call,
no inheritance.


528
00:39:20.914 --> 00:39:22.450
I saw you
with Dad at the funeral.


529
00:39:25.253 --> 00:39:27.288
He's been
helping me out lately.


530
00:39:27.322 --> 00:39:28.423
Sure.

531
00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:31.526
I don't know,
he's just--


532
00:39:32.226 --> 00:39:35.063
he's been helping me
back on my feet, you know?


533
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.232
You forgive him?

534
00:39:38.266 --> 00:39:39.467
It's not like that.

535
00:39:41.502 --> 00:39:43.904
He's been good for like
five years now or something.


536
00:39:45.006 --> 00:39:47.008
I don't know,
that AA shit...


537
00:39:47.642 --> 00:39:48.942
it works.

538
00:39:48.976 --> 00:39:50.211
Hmm.

539
00:39:50.244 --> 00:39:52.180
Is this part
of your program?


540
00:39:53.014 --> 00:39:54.482
I'm not
in any program.


541
00:39:54.982 --> 00:39:56.584
I don't need
no program.


542
00:39:56.617 --> 00:39:57.918
You sure?

543
00:39:58.953 --> 00:40:00.955
I can quit
when I want to.


544
00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:02.889
I just
don't want to.


545
00:40:08.229 --> 00:40:10.264
You may be too young
to remember this, Jackson.


546
00:40:11.032 --> 00:40:13.067
But the things that happened
in our household...


547
00:40:14.168 --> 00:40:15.869
things he did
to you, to us...


548
00:40:16.571 --> 00:40:17.638
were unforgivable.

549
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.009
I don't care if he's your
own blood, your own family.


550
00:40:24.278 --> 00:40:26.180
A real father
doesn't beat their kids


551
00:40:26.214 --> 00:40:28.015
with the fist
that wears their wedding ring.


552
00:40:30.118 --> 00:40:31.319
I've been
with you my whole life


553
00:40:31.352 --> 00:40:32.453
and I'm still
fucking here.


554
00:40:34.555 --> 00:40:35.623
You know where I am.

555
00:40:58.045 --> 00:40:59.714
Do we have
any more paint out here?


556
00:40:59.747 --> 00:41:02.183
-Uh, this one's empty, too.
-All right. Um, hmm--


557
00:41:02.216 --> 00:41:04.118
I can walk
to the store, pick some up.


558
00:41:04.152 --> 00:41:06.087
It won't take me long.
I just have to grab my wallet.


559
00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.423
Oh, no, that's okay.
I'll just drive and get some.


560
00:41:10.091 --> 00:41:12.026
-Shit.
-You all right?


561
00:41:12.059 --> 00:41:15.363
Yeah, Dylan is going to be
back from school any minute.


562
00:41:15.929 --> 00:41:18.499
Do you mind just like,
waiting on the porch?


563
00:41:18.533 --> 00:41:20.001
I just don't want
him to be...


564
00:41:20.568 --> 00:41:22.970
-spooked.
-Yeah, sure.


565
00:41:23.438 --> 00:41:24.572
I don't mean
anything by it.


566
00:41:24.605 --> 00:41:26.441
No, I get it.

567
00:41:26.474 --> 00:41:28.309
Okay,
I'll be 10 minutes, tops.


568
00:41:28.342 --> 00:41:29.477
I'll be here.

569
00:42:04.045 --> 00:42:05.646
Hello Mister.

570
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.418
It's locked.

571
00:42:13.221 --> 00:42:14.288
It's locked.

572
00:42:19.293 --> 00:42:21.128
She just went to the store.
She'll be back.


573
00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.238
Hey.

574
00:43:11.712 --> 00:43:13.614
- Hey guys.
- Hey Mom.


575
00:43:13.648 --> 00:43:15.182
What's up?

576
00:43:15.216 --> 00:43:16.384
Mister and I
are playing catch.


577
00:43:16.417 --> 00:43:18.085
I see that.

578
00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:20.154
- Can I help?
- No, it's okay. It's okay.


579
00:43:20.187 --> 00:43:22.089
Dylan, did you forget
your key at school again?


580
00:43:22.857 --> 00:43:24.592
I forgot it in my desk.

581
00:43:25.027 --> 00:43:26.360
Anything
I should know about?


582
00:43:26.894 --> 00:43:28.162
No, nothing.

583
00:43:28.964 --> 00:43:30.565
Come on, sweetheart.
It's time for lunch.


584
00:43:36.137 --> 00:43:38.306
I think
we're good for the day.


585
00:43:38.339 --> 00:43:39.574
Bye, Mister.

586
00:43:39.607 --> 00:43:40.808
Thanks
for playing catch with me.


587
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:18.212
Hello?

588
00:44:18.245 --> 00:44:21.148
Hey.
What are you up to?


589
00:44:21.182 --> 00:44:22.783
Um, nothing.

590
00:44:23.517 --> 00:44:25.853
Uh, do you
need me to come--


591
00:44:25.886 --> 00:44:27.755
come back over
and finish painting?


592
00:44:27.788 --> 00:44:28.889
No, no.

593
00:44:29.457 --> 00:44:33.194
Dylan and I are going
to East Park tomorrow.


594
00:44:33.694 --> 00:44:35.262
It's supposed to be
a beautiful day outside,


595
00:44:35.296 --> 00:44:36.764
so we're going
to make the best of it.


596
00:44:36.797 --> 00:44:39.500
And, um,
Dylan was wondering


597
00:44:39.533 --> 00:44:41.535
<i>if you wanted to join?</i>

598
00:44:41.569 --> 00:44:43.270
You don't have to
if you don't want to.


599
00:44:43.304 --> 00:44:45.573
But Dylan was quite
looking forward to it.


600
00:44:45.606 --> 00:44:48.309
He says he needs someone
to ride the go-karts with.


601
00:44:48.342 --> 00:44:49.610
He says
I'm too slow.


602
00:44:49.644 --> 00:44:51.445
I don't know
how much faster I can go.


603
00:44:55.516 --> 00:44:56.584
Hey, I'll be there.

604
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:29.877
Come on.

605
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.378
You're telling me that
you never cheated on his test?


606
00:46:31.412 --> 00:46:32.480
No.

607
00:46:32.947 --> 00:46:34.815
But you were
so busy with baseball.


608
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:36.283
Yeah, and?

609
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.552
Well, my mom would know
if I cheated.


610
00:46:38.586 --> 00:46:40.421
Like, if I came home
with a 90 on a test


611
00:46:40.454 --> 00:46:41.822
that she never
saw me study for,


612
00:46:41.856 --> 00:46:42.923
she'd know
something was up.


613
00:46:45.493 --> 00:46:46.727
Whatever happened with that?

614
00:46:47.661 --> 00:46:49.030
- What?
- Baseball.


615
00:46:49.998 --> 00:46:51.332
Why did you stop?

616
00:46:53.467 --> 00:46:54.702
You want
to know the true story


617
00:46:54.735 --> 00:46:55.936
or the one
I usually tell people?


618
00:46:59.573 --> 00:47:00.641
Both.

619
00:47:04.779 --> 00:47:06.747
Well, when people
ask me this question,


620
00:47:06.781 --> 00:47:09.550
I usually have this answer
built up in my mind.


621
00:47:10.185 --> 00:47:12.553
I usually tell them
it's 'cause...


622
00:47:13.188 --> 00:47:14.990
my dad left
when I was a kid


623
00:47:15.023 --> 00:47:17.324
and I had to help
my mom pay the bills.


624
00:47:17.758 --> 00:47:18.826
But...

625
00:47:20.528 --> 00:47:22.930
that's not true 'cause
my dad left and I was 14.


626
00:47:22.964 --> 00:47:24.966
I didn't quit baseball
until after high school.


627
00:47:25.933 --> 00:47:27.002
Then why?

628
00:47:29.971 --> 00:47:33.607
After he left and stopped
coming to my games, I just...


629
00:47:35.509 --> 00:47:37.478
guess I just
stopped caring, you know?


630
00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.481
It's tough though,

631
00:47:40.514 --> 00:47:41.882
'cause like,
I put so much time


632
00:47:41.916 --> 00:47:44.919
into this one thing
for so long and...


633
00:47:46.754 --> 00:47:48.789
it's just hard
to know when to...


634
00:47:50.391 --> 00:47:51.458
let it go.

635
00:47:54.728 --> 00:47:58.399
Why do you teach painting?
Not paint paint?


636
00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:02.336
Have you ever
seen my stuff?


637
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:04.538
No.

638
00:48:07.408 --> 00:48:09.643
This is
why I don't paint paint.


639
00:48:10.544 --> 00:48:11.612
It's amazing.

640
00:48:12.646 --> 00:48:13.681
It's...

641
00:48:14.782 --> 00:48:16.650
it kind of
reminds me of um...


642
00:48:18.153 --> 00:48:19.854
When I was a kid,

643
00:48:19.887 --> 00:48:21.488
my dad used to take us
to the beach all the time.


644
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:24.758
We'd only go on windy days
because of the waves.


645
00:48:26.061 --> 00:48:27.795
We'd race into the water

646
00:48:27.828 --> 00:48:30.031
and see who could crash
into the biggest wave.


647
00:48:33.634 --> 00:48:34.702
It's kind of...

648
00:48:35.469 --> 00:48:37.605
one of the few
good memories I have of him.


649
00:48:41.977 --> 00:48:43.844
Do you have any more?

650
00:48:43.878 --> 00:48:44.945
Yeah.

651
00:48:51.052 --> 00:48:52.087
Ooh.

652
00:48:52.786 --> 00:48:54.455
Where's that?

653
00:48:54.488 --> 00:48:57.391
Nowhere.
I created it.


654
00:48:58.659 --> 00:48:59.793
What?

655
00:48:59.827 --> 00:49:01.528
You don't have
to say anything.


656
00:49:01.562 --> 00:49:03.397
If you don't like it,
you can be honest with me.


657
00:49:05.633 --> 00:49:06.734
It's beautiful.

658
00:49:08.469 --> 00:49:10.804
What's it doing
in a box?


659
00:49:10.838 --> 00:49:11.939
What do you mean?

660
00:49:16.011 --> 00:49:17.078
What are you doing?

661
00:49:18.013 --> 00:49:21.882
This painting deserves more
than just to rot away in a box.


662
00:49:25.253 --> 00:49:26.487
There.

663
00:49:27.222 --> 00:49:28.522
Right where it belongs.

664
00:49:30.091 --> 00:49:31.859
Where will I put
the mirror then?


665
00:49:32.459 --> 00:49:33.861
What do you need
a mirror for?


666
00:49:49.978 --> 00:49:51.079
<i>Hello?</i>

667
00:49:51.112 --> 00:49:52.546
Yo,
what are you doing?


668
00:49:53.982 --> 00:49:55.083
I'm...

669
00:49:55.783 --> 00:49:57.751
I'm just
at Labatt Park right now.


670
00:49:57.785 --> 00:50:00.188
The Majors are playing.
I'm about to head in.


671
00:50:00.221 --> 00:50:02.623
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>Can I come?</i>


672
00:50:02.656 --> 00:50:03.891
Um...

673
00:50:04.326 --> 00:50:06.527
I'm actually-- I'm with some
people right now, actually.


674
00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:10.931
Who are you going with?

675
00:50:12.833 --> 00:50:13.934
You wouldn't know him.

676
00:50:15.036 --> 00:50:16.537
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

677
00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.605
Um, another time then.

678
00:50:18.639 --> 00:50:20.541
<i>Yeah.</i> Definitely.

679
00:50:21.642 --> 00:50:22.810
We got
to catch up soon.


680
00:50:23.644 --> 00:50:25.546
I miss watching
these games with you.


681
00:50:27.715 --> 00:50:28.782
Yeah, me too.

682
00:50:31.219 --> 00:50:32.686
Okay well,
I got to go.


683
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.990
It was good
talking to you though.


684
00:50:36.224 --> 00:50:37.491
You too.

685
00:50:56.978 --> 00:50:58.079
You ready?

686
00:50:59.114 --> 00:51:00.248
Okay, come on.

687
00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.155
He's their best pitcher.

688
00:51:07.188 --> 00:51:09.224
You can't just get
rid of them after one hit.


689
00:51:09.257 --> 00:51:11.192
Well, maybe the manager knows
something we don't, right?


690
00:51:11.226 --> 00:51:12.726
Maybe he thinks
his best pitcher


691
00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.195
is better suited
for another game.


692
00:51:14.229 --> 00:51:15.763
So, we'll pull him out
early to save his arm.


693
00:51:15.796 --> 00:51:17.598
It's game one of the series.

694
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:19.000
You gotta
set the stage,


695
00:51:19.034 --> 00:51:21.102
and you do that
with your best pitcher.


696
00:51:21.136 --> 00:51:23.271
How do you know all this?

697
00:51:23.304 --> 00:51:25.106
Know what?

698
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.707
All this stuff about baseball.
Aren't you like, eight?


699
00:51:27.208 --> 00:51:30.178
Every night if I watch
the 6 p.m. news with my mom,


700
00:51:30.211 --> 00:51:33.048
she'll let me stay up and watch
the late-night game on TV.


701
00:51:33.081 --> 00:51:34.182
And you do?

702
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:36.583
Oh.

703
00:51:36.617 --> 00:51:38.153
You know, I used
to stay up late at night


704
00:51:38.186 --> 00:51:40.687
and just listen on
my Walkman radio under the bed.


705
00:51:41.122 --> 00:51:43.091
I never got
to watch the games on TV.


706
00:51:43.124 --> 00:51:45.994
A radio?
You're old, Mister.


707
00:51:46.027 --> 00:51:47.328
Wow.

708
00:51:51.166 --> 00:51:53.968
And they're pulling him?
Oh, my God.


709
00:51:57.205 --> 00:51:58.672
How fast are you?

710
00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:04.245
Run!
Run, Dylan, run!


711
00:52:04.279 --> 00:52:05.879
Woo-hoo!

712
00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.749
Woo! Go, go, go!

713
00:52:08.782 --> 00:52:11.885
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, Dylan!


714
00:52:11.919 --> 00:52:16.690
Woo-hoo!
Look at him go! Yeah!


715
00:52:16.723 --> 00:52:19.693
Hey! Look at that.
You're on TV!


716
00:52:19.726 --> 00:52:20.995
Woo-hoo!

717
00:52:26.367 --> 00:52:27.701
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

718
00:52:36.877 --> 00:52:37.945
Beautiful.

719
00:52:39.847 --> 00:52:41.815
Okay everyone,
five more minutes


720
00:52:41.849 --> 00:52:43.750
and then
we will show the class.


721
00:52:45.453 --> 00:52:47.088
So, how are things?

722
00:52:47.122 --> 00:52:48.822
I'm great.

723
00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:50.924
And Dylan?

724
00:52:50.959 --> 00:52:52.393
He is at
a baseball game right now,


725
00:52:52.427 --> 00:52:54.996
so I assume
he's pretty happy as well.


726
00:52:55.029 --> 00:52:57.132
I thought you always booked
off work because of the games.


727
00:52:57.165 --> 00:52:59.968
No, not his.
He's at a Majors game.


728
00:53:00.468 --> 00:53:03.004
Oh, that's cool.
Who'd he go with? A friend?


729
00:53:04.305 --> 00:53:05.772
You could say that.

730
00:53:05.806 --> 00:53:09.144
Yeah, he's there
with a friend of mine


731
00:53:09.177 --> 00:53:11.879
where he's, um,
maybe a little bit more


732
00:53:11.912 --> 00:53:13.148
than a friend
to the both of us.


733
00:53:13.181 --> 00:53:14.781
But yes, a friend.
A friend.


734
00:53:14.815 --> 00:53:17.018
And does this friend
happen to have a name?


735
00:53:17.051 --> 00:53:19.686
Yes, Jessica.
He has a name.


736
00:53:20.288 --> 00:53:22.689
Um, it's David.

737
00:53:24.259 --> 00:53:25.360
From school.

738
00:53:26.927 --> 00:53:27.962
David.

739
00:53:28.963 --> 00:53:30.398
-Like, "David" David?
-Yeah.


740
00:53:31.499 --> 00:53:33.901
Just to be clear, we're talking
about the one who killed Scott?


741
00:53:33.934 --> 00:53:35.136
Oh, my God. Yes.

742
00:53:36.137 --> 00:53:37.938
Yes, Scott,
my ex-boyfriend,


743
00:53:37.972 --> 00:53:39.940
thank you so much
for reminding me.


744
00:53:39.974 --> 00:53:41.276
But he didn't
mean to do it.


745
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:42.477
I've explained this
to you already.


746
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:44.112
Yeah, he saved Dylan.

747
00:53:44.145 --> 00:53:46.014
But how did Dylan get there?
Because of David.


748
00:53:47.848 --> 00:53:49.184
I'm obviously
missing something here.


749
00:53:49.816 --> 00:53:51.152
You wouldn't understand.

750
00:53:52.819 --> 00:53:53.921
Ava, look at me.

751
00:53:58.459 --> 00:54:00.395
Oh my God,
you're sleeping with him.


752
00:54:00.428 --> 00:54:01.862
No. What?

753
00:54:01.895 --> 00:54:02.964
Jessica,
I am not sleeping with him.


754
00:54:02.997 --> 00:54:04.365
Keep your voice down.

755
00:54:05.066 --> 00:54:06.968
Like, I knew
you always had a crush on him,


756
00:54:07.001 --> 00:54:08.336
but I didn't
think you'd date him--


757
00:54:08.369 --> 00:54:11.005
Okay, can you just
finish the class for me?


758
00:54:12.373 --> 00:54:13.874
I didn't mean to upset you.

759
00:54:13.907 --> 00:54:15.842
-I'm just looking out for you.
-I know.


760
00:54:17.145 --> 00:54:18.246
I know.

761
00:54:21.182 --> 00:54:22.283
Careful.

762
00:54:23.351 --> 00:54:24.851
Well,
what are we gonna do now?


763
00:54:24.885 --> 00:54:26.321
-I don't know.
-I don't know either.


764
00:54:26.354 --> 00:54:28.056
I guess we're going
to have to get ice cream.


765
00:54:28.089 --> 00:54:29.856
- Hey!
- Jackson.


766
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:31.792
Is that who I think it is?

767
00:54:31.825 --> 00:54:33.428
Here, just go wait up at the
lights, I'll meet you up there.


768
00:54:33.461 --> 00:54:34.963
Answer!

769
00:54:34.996 --> 00:54:36.397
- Jackson, calm down.
- No.


770
00:54:36.431 --> 00:54:37.864
What are you
doing with him?


771
00:54:37.898 --> 00:54:39.400
Well, we just went
to the game, man.


772
00:54:39.434 --> 00:54:41.536
I thought we were finally
putting this is behind us.


773
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:43.837
Now you're--
you told him, didn't you?


774
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:46.873
That-- that I did it.
That I'm the bad guy. Right?


775
00:54:46.907 --> 00:54:48.243
They could
still press charges!


776
00:54:48.276 --> 00:54:50.345
What has this man told--

777
00:54:50.378 --> 00:54:52.779
- Get off of me!
- Shut the fuck up, hey!


778
00:54:52.813 --> 00:54:54.115
- Get off of me!
- Shut up!


779
00:54:54.148 --> 00:54:55.749
Dad, stop!

780
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.789
Don't hurt him.
I'm okay.


781
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:05.960
So, what?

782
00:55:05.994 --> 00:55:07.962
You're a daddy figure now?

783
00:55:20.874 --> 00:55:22.443
Does he know?

784
00:55:22.477 --> 00:55:23.544
No.

785
00:55:25.313 --> 00:55:27.382
You never lose, do you?

786
00:55:27.415 --> 00:55:29.417
-Jackson.
-Get the fuck off me.


787
00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:37.091
All right.
Look at me. Look at me.


788
00:55:37.125 --> 00:55:38.925
Look at my feet. Okay?

789
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.995
When you swing,
your front foot


790
00:55:41.029 --> 00:55:43.164
should step forward
like that, okay?


791
00:55:43.197 --> 00:55:44.565
And your back foot
should pivot.


792
00:55:45.566 --> 00:55:47.035
That's right.
Okay.


793
00:55:47.068 --> 00:55:48.869
Now, full motion
should look like this.


794
00:55:51.205 --> 00:55:53.207
- Hey, Ave.
- "Ave?"


795
00:55:53.241 --> 00:55:55.143
Dylan just wanted me
to help him with his swing.


796
00:55:55.977 --> 00:55:57.078
Um...

797
00:55:57.944 --> 00:56:00.214
can I talk
to you outside for a sec?


798
00:56:02.083 --> 00:56:03.151
Sure.

799
00:56:04.918 --> 00:56:06.387
Here.
All right, line it up.


800
00:56:06.421 --> 00:56:07.488
Okay?
I'll be right back.


801
00:56:17.565 --> 00:56:19.300
What's up?

802
00:56:19.334 --> 00:56:20.401
Um...

803
00:56:21.669 --> 00:56:23.338
Dylan called me
"Dad" today.


804
00:56:25.273 --> 00:56:26.341
What?

805
00:56:27.041 --> 00:56:28.109
What?

806
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.048
I-- I don't know
how to respond to that.


807
00:56:34.082 --> 00:56:35.249
What do you mean?

808
00:56:37.618 --> 00:56:39.153
He thinks
you're his dad, David.


809
00:56:39.187 --> 00:56:40.421
Ever since
you showed up.


810
00:56:41.489 --> 00:56:45.560
I don't know if it's some
sense he believes he has.


811
00:56:45.593 --> 00:56:47.962
It's why he wants
to see you all the time.


812
00:56:49.664 --> 00:56:51.199
He's curious.

813
00:56:53.501 --> 00:56:55.902
Just don't--
don't bring this up with him


814
00:56:55.936 --> 00:56:58.172
and hopefully
he will just forget about it.


815
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:03.378
I cannot deal
with this right now.


816
00:57:03.411 --> 00:57:04.579
Well, I can.

817
00:57:07.014 --> 00:57:08.882
I can be there for him.

818
00:57:09.484 --> 00:57:10.651
For you. I--

819
00:57:12.086 --> 00:57:13.521
I can be
that person.


820
00:57:21.362 --> 00:57:22.563
Good night, David.

821
00:57:39.447 --> 00:57:41.215
Strike three!
Batter, out.


822
00:57:42.116 --> 00:57:43.184
Switch sides.

823
00:58:05.206 --> 00:58:07.575
Excuse me, are you going
to keep calling the game?


824
00:58:07.608 --> 00:58:08.942
Are you
who I think you are?


825
00:58:09.577 --> 00:58:11.712
-Sorry?
-Are you who I think you are?


826
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:17.485
-Let's go, buddy!
-Go Dylan.


827
00:58:21.456 --> 00:58:23.257
Oh, that's okay, buddy.
That's okay.


828
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:25.126
Right back here.
Right back.


829
00:58:25.159 --> 00:58:27.028
Hey.

830
00:58:27.061 --> 00:58:28.729
Aren't you that guy who killed
that dude in a car accident?


831
00:58:28.763 --> 00:58:31.466
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Oh yeah, it is you.


832
00:58:31.499 --> 00:58:32.967
How the hell
did you get this job?


833
00:58:33.434 --> 00:58:35.036
Ma'am, it's a--
it's a minimum wage--


834
00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:36.504
I don't care.

835
00:58:36.537 --> 00:58:38.739
You shouldn't be
umping a kid's baseball game.


836
00:58:40.041 --> 00:58:41.742
Who hired you?

837
00:58:41.776 --> 00:58:43.544
Oh dude, my dad read about you
in the paper a few weeks ago.


838
00:58:43.578 --> 00:58:45.546
You-- you must have
just gotten out.


839
00:58:46.347 --> 00:58:47.515
Dude, you're a monster.

840
00:58:50.251 --> 00:58:52.186
I'm going to call
the commissioner.


841
00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:54.255
Hell,
maybe even the Free Press.


842
00:58:55.289 --> 00:58:56.357
Ava.

843
00:58:57.825 --> 00:58:59.427
-Hey.
-It's okay.


844
00:58:59.861 --> 00:59:01.329
David,
I'm not mad at you.


845
00:59:01.362 --> 00:59:02.630
It's just the kids.
I'm sorry.


846
00:59:02.663 --> 00:59:05.299
I just need time.
I just need space.


847
00:59:07.368 --> 00:59:08.769
Watch the game
and then we'll go.


848
00:59:11.672 --> 00:59:12.773
Yeah.

849
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.022
Listen, kid.

850
00:59:28.823 --> 00:59:30.191
I don't want to do this.

851
00:59:31.425 --> 00:59:32.660
But some parents
around the league


852
00:59:32.693 --> 00:59:34.262
noticed you and complained.

853
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:39.166
I told you
not to take the mask off.


854
00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:47.174
Listen.

855
00:59:47.842 --> 00:59:49.544
Umping
wasn't for you anyways.


856
00:59:50.745 --> 00:59:52.179
Take the rest
of the season off.


857
00:59:52.213 --> 00:59:53.614
We can talk about
a coaching job


858
00:59:53.648 --> 00:59:54.715
later in the year.

859
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:57.118
When you're out
of the news more.


860
00:59:57.151 --> 00:59:58.219
Okay?

861
01:00:01.289 --> 01:00:03.291
Things like this die down
quicker than you'd think.


862
01:00:05.126 --> 01:00:07.395
There's going to be a bigger
and worse story next week.


863
01:00:13.768 --> 01:00:15.102
Hey.

864
01:00:15.136 --> 01:00:16.203
Head up.

865
01:00:17.772 --> 01:00:19.540
Don't let this
beat you down, kid.


866
01:00:20.908 --> 01:00:22.843
You made a mistake.

867
01:00:22.877 --> 01:00:24.145
Make up for it.

868
01:00:25.613 --> 01:00:27.248
That's the best
you can do.


869
01:00:31.886 --> 01:00:33.154
Coming!

870
01:00:42.763 --> 01:00:45.399
-What are you doing here?
-Let's go. Come on.


871
01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:47.201
-Where?
-Coming or what?


872
01:00:47.935 --> 01:00:49.370
Come on,
I'll tell you on the way.


873
01:00:50.705 --> 01:00:51.772
'Kay, just--

874
01:00:55.776 --> 01:00:57.478
Okay, honey,

875
01:00:57.511 --> 01:00:59.180
I'm going to go out
with David for a little bit.


876
01:00:59.213 --> 01:01:00.748
I'll be
back soon, okay?


877
01:01:00.781 --> 01:01:02.683
Can I watch the game,
please?


878
01:01:02.717 --> 01:01:04.518
Mmm,
what do I say?


879
01:01:04.552 --> 01:01:06.253
Only if I
watch the news.


880
01:01:06.287 --> 01:01:07.655
Good boy.
I love you.


881
01:01:07.688 --> 01:01:08.856
Muah! Muah.

882
01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:11.192
Be good.

883
01:01:11.859 --> 01:01:13.861
I'll have Jessica
come check on you.


884
01:01:13.894 --> 01:01:15.429
Love you, sweetie.

Okay.

929
01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:56.117
Mom!

930
01:05:02.923 --> 01:05:04.692
Why didn't you tell me?

931
01:05:10.098 --> 01:05:12.833
I know who Mister really is!

932
01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:14.970
The lady
on the news told me!


933
01:05:17.638 --> 01:05:19.406
You betrayed me!

What happened?

936
01:05:23.011 --> 01:05:24.678
You lied to me!

937
01:05:40.661 --> 01:05:42.496
- David.
- Don't come near me.


938
01:05:42.529 --> 01:05:44.065
-I fucking mean it.
-I just want to talk.


939
01:05:44.099 --> 01:05:45.633
I said,
don't fucking touch me!

01:05:45.666 --> 01:05:47.969
All I'm asking for
is a conversation.


941
01:05:48.003 --> 01:05:49.137
A second chance.

942
01:05:51.206 --> 01:05:52.840
You want
a second chance, huh?


943
01:05:52.873 --> 01:05:54.942
Yes. Please.

944
01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:56.644
Okay.

945
01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:58.512
All right.

946
01:05:59.947 --> 01:06:01.916
Go home.

947
01:06:01.949 --> 01:06:04.652
Go home or wherever
the fuck you came from.


948
01:06:06.021 --> 01:06:07.721
Build yourself
a time machine.


949
01:06:07.755 --> 01:06:08.923
Are you with me so far?

950
01:06:11.558 --> 01:06:13.028
Go back in time, okay?

951
01:06:13.061 --> 01:06:14.662
Don't beat my mother.

952
01:06:14.695 --> 01:06:16.064
Don't beat my brother.

953
01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:17.798
Don't come home
drunk every night.


954
01:06:19.733 --> 01:06:20.801
Can you do that?

955
01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:23.204
I know I can't
change the past, David.


956
01:06:23.238 --> 01:06:24.738
Yeah,
you're goddamn right you can't.


957
01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:26.807
David.

958
01:06:30.045 --> 01:06:31.112
David, please.

959
01:06:34.515 --> 01:06:35.582
David.

960
01:06:36.084 --> 01:06:37.218
David,
if you can hear me...


961
01:06:38.186 --> 01:06:39.720
Jackson is in jail.

962
01:06:42.523 --> 01:06:43.857
He got into a fight
in a bar,


963
01:06:43.891 --> 01:06:45.492
and he called me
to bail him out.


964
01:06:45.526 --> 01:06:46.627
But...

965
01:06:47.728 --> 01:06:48.796
I think
it should be you.


966
01:06:51.199 --> 01:06:53.101
I think you should
be the one to go get him.


967
01:07:34.608 --> 01:07:35.676
You all right?

968
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.287
Hey!

969
01:07:46.321 --> 01:07:47.755
Thanks for the bailout, bro.

970
01:07:47.788 --> 01:07:49.523
Wouldn't be
the first time.


971
01:07:49.991 --> 01:07:51.026
Is that
what this is about?


972
01:07:51.558 --> 01:07:52.826
Is this about what?

973
01:07:55.263 --> 01:07:56.530
It is, isn't it?

974
01:07:57.731 --> 01:07:59.134
You're still mad
about what I did.


975
01:08:00.301 --> 01:08:02.736
Do you know
who I did it for?


976
01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:04.905
-I did it for you, Jackson.
-See, there.


977
01:08:04.938 --> 01:08:06.975
That's the problem
right there.


978
01:08:07.008 --> 01:08:08.609
Sure, yeah,
you went to prison for it.


979
01:08:08.642 --> 01:08:09.743
For me.

980
01:08:09.777 --> 01:08:11.578
Thank you,
Master David.


981
01:08:11.612 --> 01:08:12.880
Thank you
for taking the fall.


982
01:08:12.913 --> 01:08:15.682
I owe you my life.
But fuck you!


983
01:08:15.716 --> 01:08:17.751
You caused that accident
way more than I did.


984
01:08:17.785 --> 01:08:19.087
And then
you take the fall


985
01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.888
and think
you're baptized or something?


986
01:08:20.921 --> 01:08:21.889
I didn't cause the accident.
You drove the car.


987
01:08:21.922 --> 01:08:23.324
You took me to the bar!

988
01:08:23.358 --> 01:08:25.926
We took your car.
You chose to drink.


989
01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.828
You chose
to make me drive home.


990
01:08:29.364 --> 01:08:31.565
I was 18.
How is that fair?


991
01:08:33.767 --> 01:08:35.236
You're not the angel
you think you are.


992
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:37.105
I don't think that.
I didn't say that.


993
01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:39.606
Well,
that's what Mom thought.


994
01:08:40.308 --> 01:08:42.243
Don't you dare
bring mom into this.


995
01:08:42.277 --> 01:08:43.777
You're the oldest.

996
01:08:43.811 --> 01:08:45.879
The athletic one.
The good-looking one.


997
01:08:46.514 --> 01:08:49.284
The perfect son that saved us
from our abusive father.


998
01:08:49.317 --> 01:08:51.986
Me, I'm the runt
she never gave two shits about.


999
01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.988
She'd look at me
and feel like a failure.


1000
01:08:54.022 --> 01:08:55.656
-Jackson!
-No, you listen.


1001
01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:57.825
That's all she said,
all the time.


1002
01:08:57.858 --> 01:08:59.227
You're perfect
and I'm not.


1003
01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.727
You saved me.

1004
01:09:00.761 --> 01:09:02.130
And I should have been
the one in jail.


1005
01:09:02.163 --> 01:09:03.231
Not you. Me.

1006
01:09:05.732 --> 01:09:07.268
She couldn't even
look me in the eye anymore.


1007
01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:09.137
Jack...

1008
01:09:11.772 --> 01:09:13.007
What,
you want me to apologize?


1009
01:09:13.041 --> 01:09:14.075
I killed someone!

1010
01:09:14.908 --> 01:09:17.145
I killed someone.

1011
01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.747
And I took the fall.

1012
01:09:25.153 --> 01:09:27.288
I didn't ask for it.

1013
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:30.924
I didn't ask
for you to take the fall.


1014
01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.828
I've been suffering
for five fucking years.


1015
01:09:36.331 --> 01:09:38.099
I may not have
gone to jail,


1016
01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:40.235
but life on the outside
sure as hell felt like one.


1017
01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:20.375
<i>David,</i>
<i>just-- just slow down, man.</i>


1018
01:10:20.408 --> 01:10:22.310
<i>Just fucking</i>
<i>slow down, okay?</i>


1019
01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:24.012
<i>Look.</i>
<i>Let's just call Mom.</i>


1020
01:10:24.045 --> 01:10:25.712
<i>She'll know</i>
<i>what to do.</i>


1021
01:10:25.746 --> 01:10:26.947
<i>Let's just fucking call Mom.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>


1022
01:10:26.981 --> 01:10:28.416
<i>David!</i>

1023
01:10:28.449 --> 01:10:29.917
<i>Grow up! Be a man!</i>

1024
01:10:31.386 --> 01:10:33.021
<i>You got us</i>
<i>into this mess.</i>


1025
01:10:33.054 --> 01:10:34.355
<i>I'm going to</i>
<i>get us out of it.</i>


1026
01:10:34.389 --> 01:10:35.789
<i>Mom can't</i>
<i>save you from this.</i>


1027
01:10:35.822 --> 01:10:36.890
<i>Fuck.</i>

1028
01:10:36.924 --> 01:10:38.393
<i>You all right, Dylan?</i>

1029
01:10:38.426 --> 01:10:40.228
<i>Stay with me, bud.</i>
<i>Stay with me.</i>


1030
01:11:04.918 --> 01:11:05.987
<i>So...</i>

1031
01:11:07.956 --> 01:11:10.824
<i>we've got David Arnold</i>
<i>and Jackson Arnold, correct?</i>


1032
01:11:12.793 --> 01:11:14.162
<i>You guys called</i>
<i>someone to let them know</i>


1033
01:11:14.195 --> 01:11:15.530
<i>you're down here</i>
<i>at the precinct tonight?</i>


1034
01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:16.830
<i>Our mother.</i>

1035
01:11:17.798 --> 01:11:19.467
<i>Now, David, you're 23.</i>

1036
01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.302
<i>-Jackson, you're--</i>
<i>-18.</i>


1037
01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:29.310
<i>I just have one more thing</i>
<i>I got to ask right now.</i>


1038
01:11:33.448 --> 01:11:35.116
<i>Who drove</i>
<i>the Chevelle tonight?</i>


1039
01:11:43.024 --> 01:11:44.092
<i>I did.</i>

1040
01:11:54.369 --> 01:11:57.071
<i>David Reginald Arnold,</i>

1041
01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:59.440
<i>I'm placing you under arrest</i>
<i>for vehicular manslaughter.</i>


1042
01:11:59.474 --> 01:12:01.442
<i>You understand?</i>

1043
01:12:01.476 --> 01:12:03.877
<i>You have</i>
<i>the right to retain</i>


1044
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:05.380
<i>and instruct counsel</i>
<i>without delay.</i>


1045
01:12:05.413 --> 01:12:06.481
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1046
01:12:07.315 --> 01:12:09.284
<i>You have the right...</i>

1047
01:12:09.317 --> 01:12:11.252
<i>to contact an attorney...</i>

1048
01:12:45.653 --> 01:12:47.221
<i>Mom. Mom!</i>

1049
01:12:47.255 --> 01:12:48.323
<i>Mom!</i>

1050
01:12:51.059 --> 01:12:52.126
<i>Mom.</i>

1051
01:13:44.145 --> 01:13:45.213
What?

1052
01:13:48.282 --> 01:13:49.384
What are you up to?

1053
01:13:53.287 --> 01:13:54.389
Dylan doing all right?

1054
01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:58.226
<i>Yeah, he's okay.</i>

1055
01:13:58.259 --> 01:14:00.061
<i>He's at a sleep over, so...</i>

1056
01:14:01.462 --> 01:14:02.663
hopefully
that'll cheer him up.


1057
01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:08.102
I think you should come over
and we should talk.


1058
01:14:08.136 --> 01:14:09.470
We should talk
about what happened.


1059
01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:15.443
I'll be there.

1060
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:50.378
Hey.

1061
01:14:50.944 --> 01:14:52.980
How'd you get here?
Is that your car?


1062
01:14:57.552 --> 01:14:58.686
Are you drunk?

1063
01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:06.427
-David, are you drunk?
-No.


1064
01:15:07.595 --> 01:15:08.996
Don't lie to me.

1065
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:10.231
I can taste it
on your breath!


1066
01:15:10.264 --> 01:15:11.432
I'm not drunk.

1067
01:15:13.034 --> 01:15:15.269
And you drove here?
You drove here in that car?


1068
01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:16.370
What the--

1069
01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:20.107
What is wrong with you?

1070
01:15:20.708 --> 01:15:21.976
You think
you know me?


1071
01:15:24.045 --> 01:15:25.246
You don't know me, Ava.

1072
01:15:27.181 --> 01:15:28.249
I fucked up.

1073
01:15:29.584 --> 01:15:31.185
I fucked up.

1074
01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:34.989
I'm suffocating here!

1075
01:15:38.192 --> 01:15:39.494
What?

1076
01:15:39.527 --> 01:15:41.028
You don't have
anything to say?


1077
01:15:44.098 --> 01:15:45.533
Come on,
say something!


1078
01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:50.771
I ruin my mom's life.

1079
01:15:50.805 --> 01:15:52.340
I-- I ruined
my brother's life.


1080
01:15:52.373 --> 01:15:53.474
I'm ruining your life.

1081
01:15:58.212 --> 01:15:59.413
I don't know
why you tolerate me


1082
01:15:59.447 --> 01:16:00.515
after all I've done.

1083
01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:07.221
Because.

1084
01:16:08.656 --> 01:16:11.726
Because I understand
what you did for your brother


1085
01:16:11.759 --> 01:16:14.095
and what you did
for my son.


1086
01:16:18.799 --> 01:16:20.067
What if it was me?

1087
01:16:25.339 --> 01:16:26.407
What if I did it?

1088
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:36.617
Did you?

1089
01:18:05.773 --> 01:18:07.908
Dad.
Dad, come on.


1090
01:18:07.942 --> 01:18:09.644
Go, go, go, go.
Come on.


1091
01:18:09.677 --> 01:18:10.878
-Okay.
-I'm not going.


1092
01:18:13.614 --> 01:18:15.282
Come on.

1093
01:19:12.707 --> 01:19:13.774
Hey.

1094
01:19:14.742 --> 01:19:15.876
Thanks for seeing me.

1095
01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.915
-Are you hungry? It's on me.
-No.


1096
01:19:25.553 --> 01:19:26.821
Okay--

1097
01:19:26.854 --> 01:19:27.888
Look, I'm not here
to forgive you.


1098
01:19:28.456 --> 01:19:31.225
What you did to my mother
and my brother is inexcusable.


1099
01:19:31.859 --> 01:19:33.627
I'll never
forgive you for that.


1100
01:19:33.661 --> 01:19:35.496
-I'm-- I'm not here for that.
-So, what do you want?


1101
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:38.033
You just want to talk things
over now that Mom's dead?


1102
01:19:38.066 --> 01:19:39.333
You want to be friends?

1103
01:19:40.035 --> 01:19:41.702
It's not going to happen.
It's not that easy.


1104
01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:43.671
You think
you could do that with Jackson,


1105
01:19:43.704 --> 01:19:45.272
but he doesn't even know
half of the shit


1106
01:19:45.306 --> 01:19:46.407
that you did to him.

1107
01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:47.708
He doesn't realize.

1108
01:19:47.742 --> 01:19:49.376
You know
that he's drinking more


1109
01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:50.745
than he's ever drank before
because of you?


1110
01:19:50.778 --> 01:19:52.580
And he thinks that
that's okay.


1111
01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:54.482
He's an alcoholic
because of you.


1112
01:19:54.515 --> 01:19:56.484
Because you're an alcoholic.
And you made him that way.


1113
01:19:56.517 --> 01:19:57.585
No, I know!

1114
01:20:03.724 --> 01:20:04.792
David, please.

1115
01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.696
Please, just listen to me.
Okay?


1116
01:20:11.365 --> 01:20:12.433
That night.

1117
01:20:14.635 --> 01:20:16.604
Five years ago,
the night of the crash...


1118
01:20:17.671 --> 01:20:19.507
your mother called me.

1119
01:20:21.109 --> 01:20:23.577
And she said something to me
that I will never forget.


1120
01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:24.678
She said...

1121
01:20:25.479 --> 01:20:26.514
"Matthew...

1122
01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:28.549
our boys
are in trouble...


1123
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:30.551
and I need your help."

1124
01:20:32.753 --> 01:20:35.456
Your mother,
my wife of 16 years...


1125
01:20:36.724 --> 01:20:37.792
needed my help.

1126
01:20:37.825 --> 01:20:38.893
Her...

1127
01:20:39.593 --> 01:20:42.830
abusive,
drunken, messed up...


1128
01:20:43.631 --> 01:20:44.799
ex-husband's help.

1129
01:20:45.566 --> 01:20:47.035
And I knew
she really needed it,


1130
01:20:47.068 --> 01:20:49.370
and I was wanted,
David.


1131
01:20:49.403 --> 01:20:50.571
I was wanted...

1132
01:20:51.672 --> 01:20:53.641
for the first time
in a decade.


1133
01:20:56.077 --> 01:20:57.344
I was...

1134
01:20:58.079 --> 01:20:59.446
I was a real mess

1135
01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.681
after I left the family.

1136
01:21:01.549 --> 01:21:03.684
But from the night
of that phone call,


1137
01:21:03.717 --> 01:21:05.653
I haven't touched
a drop of alcohol.


1138
01:21:07.055 --> 01:21:09.057
Because I made
a promise to myself.


1139
01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:10.825
And I made a promise
to your mother,


1140
01:21:10.858 --> 01:21:12.626
the love
of my life...


1141
01:21:13.527 --> 01:21:15.496
that I would do right
by her children...


1142
01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:18.033
and I would do right by her.

1143
01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:22.736
And my drinking,
I know...


1144
01:21:24.572 --> 01:21:26.074
it took the family
to a dark place.


1145
01:21:27.042 --> 01:21:28.109
And I take that blame.

1146
01:21:31.445 --> 01:21:32.947
But I'm in AA now, David.

1147
01:21:36.617 --> 01:21:38.119
I'm sober five years.

1148
01:21:40.821 --> 01:21:42.756
And I know you wouldn't see me
while you were in prison.


1149
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:44.658
I-
- I understand that.

1150
01:21:45.126 --> 01:21:47.394
So, I waited and I waited
until you got out...


1151
01:21:47.963 --> 01:21:49.130
so that
I could see you...


1152
01:21:53.434 --> 01:21:55.436
and apologize
to you for the...


1153
01:21:57.973 --> 01:21:59.506
the horrible things...

1154
01:22:00.608 --> 01:22:01.675
that I did to you...

1155
01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:04.778
and your mother...

1156
01:22:05.913 --> 01:22:06.982
and Jackson.

1157
01:22:11.785 --> 01:22:12.853
I'm sorry.

1158
01:22:14.822 --> 01:22:15.991
And I'm trying here, David.

1159
01:22:16.024 --> 01:22:17.491
I'm-- I'm really,
really trying.


1160
01:22:17.524 --> 01:22:18.626
So, I'm just asking...

1161
01:22:20.028 --> 01:22:21.395
for a second chance.

1162
01:22:24.632 --> 01:22:26.467
Your mother's
dying wish to me


1163
01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.801
was to look
after our boys.


1164
01:22:30.171 --> 01:22:32.073
And that's exactly
what I want to try and do.


1165
01:22:34.708 --> 01:22:37.611
Because
that's what family does.


1166
01:23:06.874 --> 01:23:07.976
I'm sorry, Jackson.

1167
01:23:10.245 --> 01:23:11.879
You're right.

1168
01:23:11.912 --> 01:23:13.181
We were both drinking.

1169
01:23:13.214 --> 01:23:14.615
I should never have
let you drive.


1170
01:23:16.051 --> 01:23:18.119
I'm your big brother,
I'm supposed to protect you.


1171
01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.089
I thought
I was doing that, but...


1172
01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:23.457
I realize now...

1173
01:23:24.892 --> 01:23:25.961
where that's put you.

1174
01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:29.863
I failed you
as a brother...


1175
01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.767
and a friend...

1176
01:23:36.237 --> 01:23:37.504
and I'm sorry.

1177
01:23:44.012 --> 01:23:45.280
Come on, man.

1178
01:23:45.313 --> 01:23:46.947
It's okay.

1179
01:23:46.982 --> 01:23:48.016
You're okay with me.

1180
01:23:48.949 --> 01:23:50.617
Come on, it's okay.

1181
01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.519
Yeah.

1182
01:23:52.553 --> 01:23:53.620
It's okay.

1183
01:23:58.926 --> 01:23:59.995
It's okay.

1184
01:24:01.262 --> 01:24:03.064
Okay.

1185
01:24:40.667 --> 01:24:41.735
Hello?

1186
01:25:13.968 --> 01:25:15.170
Dylan.

1187
01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:21.076
What are you doing here?

1188
01:25:23.111 --> 01:25:24.645
I, uh, um...

1189
01:25:26.047 --> 01:25:27.115
I just came to talk.

1190
01:25:30.018 --> 01:25:32.253
I think
we're a bit beyond that.


1191
01:25:38.126 --> 01:25:39.194
Are you moving?

1192
01:25:43.431 --> 01:25:45.766
Yeah and actually,
we have to go soon.


1193
01:25:45.799 --> 01:25:46.867
Mom?

1194
01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:50.371
Where's my backpack?

1195
01:26:05.719 --> 01:26:07.055
Why'd you do it?

1196
01:26:07.088 --> 01:26:08.323
I'm so sorry.

1197
01:26:09.991 --> 01:26:11.059
God, I'm sorry.

1198
01:26:12.726 --> 01:26:14.695
I don't want to go.

1199
01:26:14.728 --> 01:26:16.297
It's going to be okay.

1200
01:26:16.331 --> 01:26:17.398
It'll be all right.

1201
01:26:18.732 --> 01:26:20.034
You got
a great mom here.


1202
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:22.237
Don't you forget it.

1203
01:26:23.104 --> 01:26:25.373
You're going to meet
so many new friends.


1204
01:26:37.784 --> 01:26:39.053
No, this is yours now.

1205
01:26:40.787 --> 01:26:42.123
You take care
of this glove.


1206
01:26:42.157 --> 01:26:44.058
You wear it
every second of every day.


1207
01:26:44.725 --> 01:26:46.995
Don't leave it
in the rain, okay?


1208
01:26:47.728 --> 01:26:49.897
I want to hear
about your home run.


1209
01:26:49.930 --> 01:26:51.899
Are you going to come
to all my games?


1210
01:26:55.170 --> 01:26:57.038
Well, I mean,
I'll be able to--


1211
01:27:00.475 --> 01:27:02.277
Yeah. I'll be there.

1212
01:27:05.246 --> 01:27:07.215
Honey, go see if you left
anything in your room.


1213
01:27:07.948 --> 01:27:09.050
We gotta go.

1214
01:27:10.118 --> 01:27:11.319
Goodbye, Mister.

1215
01:27:33.041 --> 01:27:34.908
-Ava, I'm--
-I know.


1216
01:29:24.885 --> 01:29:26.587
Today,
I'm here with my two sons,


1217
01:29:26.621 --> 01:29:28.122
David and Jackson.

1218
01:29:28.556 --> 01:29:30.024
Welcome David and Jackson.

1219
01:29:33.561 --> 01:29:35.229
As some of you might remember

1220
01:29:35.263 --> 01:29:36.331
from my story...

1221
01:29:39.033 --> 01:29:40.934
you know that
I hurt these two boys very...


1222
01:29:42.236 --> 01:29:43.304
very badly.

1223
01:29:45.173 --> 01:29:46.607
And I haven't been
a part of their lives


1224
01:29:46.641 --> 01:29:48.443
for a very long time
because of my drinking.


1225
01:29:49.977 --> 01:29:51.845
And because of what
alcohol did to me and...


1226
01:29:53.047 --> 01:29:54.115
in the end, to them.

1227
01:29:56.150 --> 01:29:57.585
And it wasn't until
the last few months


1228
01:29:57.618 --> 01:29:59.287
that I've been able
to reconnect with them.


1229
01:30:01.956 --> 01:30:03.424
And they're
going to try and let me...


1230
01:30:03.458 --> 01:30:04.891
rebuild together.

1231
01:30:07.995 --> 01:30:09.030
I can't--

1232
01:30:09.630 --> 01:30:12.033
I can't take back
what I did to them.


1233
01:30:13.368 --> 01:30:14.402
All I can do is...

1234
01:30:15.670 --> 01:30:17.938
try to make up for it
in any way that I can.


1235
01:30:36.224 --> 01:30:37.425
I call this room.

1236
01:31:10.258 --> 01:31:11.993
Thought you'd be
getting tired of the good old


1237
01:31:12.026 --> 01:31:13.995
heel toe express.

1238
01:31:14.028 --> 01:31:16.063
Holy shit, Jackson.

1239
01:31:18.466 --> 01:31:19.534
You can't afford that.

1240
01:31:21.202 --> 01:31:22.270
Don't worry about it.

1241
01:31:25.473 --> 01:31:27.408
- No, take it back.
- It's yours.


1242
01:31:28.409 --> 01:31:29.477
Take it, bro.

1243
01:31:30.211 --> 01:31:31.479
Are you kidding me, man?

1244
01:31:33.147 --> 01:31:34.682
Can't have
my big bro bussing around.


1245
01:31:36.184 --> 01:31:37.485
Do you remember
how to bicycle?


1246
01:31:37.518 --> 01:31:39.320
It's one foot after the other,
okay bud?


1247
01:31:39.353 --> 01:31:41.389
Yeah. Thanks.

1248
01:32:08.516 --> 01:32:10.051
And now,

1249
01:32:10.084 --> 01:32:11.619
I'd like to call up
Jackson Arnold...


1250
01:32:12.286 --> 01:32:15.122
for surpassing
his 30-day-sober mark.


1251
01:32:15.156 --> 01:32:16.557
Congratulations, Jackson.

1252
01:32:19.126 --> 01:32:20.194
Woo!

1253
01:32:24.265 --> 01:32:25.766
Come on, Dylan!

1254
01:32:30.171 --> 01:32:32.139
Woo!

1255
01:32:32.173 --> 01:32:33.508
Run!

1256
01:32:35.543 --> 01:32:37.178
Woo!

1257
01:32:37.678 --> 01:32:39.580
Ball four.
Batter, take your base.


1258
01:32:42.850 --> 01:32:44.118
Ump, time!

1259
01:32:51.325 --> 01:32:52.393
Hey. Head up.

1260
01:32:54.729 --> 01:32:55.796
All right.

1261
01:32:57.098 --> 01:32:58.566
It's four-three us.

1262
01:32:58.599 --> 01:33:00.801
Two outs.
They got the bases loaded.


1263
01:33:00.835 --> 01:33:02.637
And you just walked
three straight guys.


1264
01:33:03.137 --> 01:33:05.373
This kid on home plate
could win the game for them.


1265
01:33:07.808 --> 01:33:09.210
I should take you out.

1266
01:33:20.588 --> 01:33:22.056
But I'm not
going to do that.


1267
01:33:25.393 --> 01:33:26.527
'Cause you're
our best pitcher.


1268
01:33:26.561 --> 01:33:27.628
We need you here, buddy.

1269
01:33:29.864 --> 01:33:32.099
All right, I'm going to go back
to the dugout.


1270
01:33:32.133 --> 01:33:33.534
I want you to throw
three strikes


1271
01:33:33.568 --> 01:33:34.869
straight down the middle
and win this game for us.


1272
