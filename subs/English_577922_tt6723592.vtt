1
00:01:13.788 --> 00:01:14.855
Hey!

2
00:02:59.494 --> 00:03:01.229
We live in a twilight world.

3
00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:05.210
We live in a twilight world.

4
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.245
And there are no friends at dusk.

5
00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:10.071
You've been made. This siege is
a blind for them to vanish you.


6
00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:16.854
But I established contact.

7
00:03:16.944 --> 00:03:18.622
Bring you in or kill you.

8
00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:20.982
I have two minutes.
Make up your mind.


9
00:03:25.786 --> 00:03:27.132
Where's the package?

10
00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:28.356
Coat check.

11
00:03:52.813 --> 00:03:53.881
Stay.

12
00:04:20.275 --> 00:04:21.785
No friends at dusk, huh?

13
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:22.820
You'll do.

14
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.412
Get him to the rally point.

15
00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:59.291
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians
are expecting a passenger.


16
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:01.126
I've never seen encapsulation
like this.


17
00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:03.528
We don't know how old it is,
but it's the real deal.


18
00:05:03.618 --> 00:05:04.563
Did you have an out?

19
00:05:04.653 --> 00:05:06.431
Service tunnel to the sewer.

20
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:09.833
Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.


21
00:05:09.923 --> 00:05:11.269
Can you defuse that?

22
00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:12.671
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?


23
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:14.239
Covering their tracks.

24
00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:15.806
Taking out the audience?
They're just the cheap seats.


25
00:05:15.896 --> 00:05:16.675
That's not our mission.

26
00:05:16.765 --> 00:05:18.033
Mine now.

27
00:05:43.425 --> 00:05:44.426
Walk away.

28
00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:50.398
You don't have to kill these people.

29
00:06:03.078 --> 00:06:04.122
That wasn't one of us.

30
00:06:04.212 --> 00:06:05.913
I'll take the help.

31
00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:09.017
Go, go, go.

32
00:06:39.547 --> 00:06:40.892
A man can be trained

33
00:06:40.982 --> 00:06:42.927
to hold out for about 18 hours,

34
00:06:43.017 --> 00:06:46.154
so your colleagues
will be clear by 7:00.


35
00:06:52.193 --> 00:06:54.005
He didn't last 18 minutes.

36
00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:55.974
He didn't have anything
to hide.


37
00:06:56.064 --> 00:06:58.500
You were smuggling a nobody.

38
00:07:01.536 --> 00:07:03.271
It's risky.

39
00:07:06.341 --> 00:07:08.787
Or were you counting on this?

40
00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:10.288
Death.

41
00:07:10.378 --> 00:07:12.313
CIA issue.

42
00:07:19.354 --> 00:07:22.624
Spare yourself, once they clear.

43
00:07:36.937 --> 00:07:38.983
Almost 7:00.

44
00:07:39.073 --> 00:07:40.442
Uh oh.

45
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.282
It's running fast.

46
00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:53.488
We have to put it back one hour.

47
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:14.476
Get it out!

48
00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:40.979
Welcome to the afterlife.

49
00:08:41.069 --> 00:08:43.348
You've been in a
medically induced coma


50
00:08:43.438 --> 00:08:47.118
while we got you out of Ukraine
and rebuilt your mouth.


51
00:08:47.208 --> 00:08:51.446
The suicide pills are fake.

52
00:08:52.347 --> 00:08:53.625
Why?

53
00:08:53.715 --> 00:08:55.326
A test.

54
00:08:55.416 --> 00:08:56.551
A test?

55
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.723
They pulled my teeth out.

56
00:09:03.157 --> 00:09:05.527
Did my team get clear?

57
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.772
No.

58
00:09:07.862 --> 00:09:09.797
Private Russians, we think.

59
00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:12.734
Somebody talked.

60
00:09:13.768 --> 00:09:15.280
Not you.

61
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.506
You chose to die instead of
giving up your colleagues.


62
00:09:27.348 --> 00:09:31.262
We all believe we'd run
into the burning building.


63
00:09:31.352 --> 00:09:35.633
But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.


64
00:09:35.723 --> 00:09:37.091
You do.

65
00:09:42.964 --> 00:09:44.609
I resign.

66
00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:48.313
You don't work for us.
You're dead.


67
00:09:48.403 --> 00:09:51.282
Your duty transcends national interests.

68
00:09:51.372 --> 00:09:53.374
This is about survival.

69
00:09:55.677 --> 00:09:56.778
Whose?

70
00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:00.715
Everyone's.

71
00:10:03.217 --> 00:10:06.397
There's a cold war, cold as ice.

72
00:10:06.487 --> 00:10:10.134
To even know its true nature
is to lose.


73
00:10:10.224 --> 00:10:11.836
This is knowledge divided.

74
00:10:11.926 --> 00:10:15.473
All I have for you is a gesture

75
00:10:15.563 --> 00:10:17.943
in combination with a word.

76
00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:19.334
"Tenet."

77
00:10:21.003 --> 00:10:23.748
Use it carefully.

78
00:10:23.838 --> 00:10:27.118
It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones, too.


79
00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:29.344
That's all they've told you?

80
00:10:30.345 --> 00:10:32.113
That test you passed?

81
00:10:33.748 --> 00:10:34.849
Not everybody does.

82
00:12:47.815 --> 00:12:52.563
With a high vis vest and a clipboard,
you can get almost anywhere.


83
00:12:52.653 --> 00:12:54.355
Almost.

84
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.457
An obscure tenet.

85
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.544
No small talk.

86
00:13:06.634 --> 00:13:08.746
Nothing that might reveal
who we are or what we do.


87
00:13:08.836 --> 00:13:11.582
I thought I was here
to find out what we do.


88
00:13:11.672 --> 00:13:14.318
You're not here for "What,"
you're here for "How."


89
00:13:14.408 --> 00:13:17.555
"What" is your department
and not my business.


90
00:13:17.645 --> 00:13:19.857
Well, to do what I do...

91
00:13:19.947 --> 00:13:22.850
I need some idea
of the threat we face.


92
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.866
As I understand it, we're trying
to prevent World War III.


93
00:13:28.956 --> 00:13:30.691
Nuclear holocaust?

94
00:13:31.126 --> 00:13:32.360
No.

95
00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:35.429
Something worse.

96
00:13:44.505 --> 00:13:45.907
Aim it and pull the trigger.

97
00:13:47.976 --> 00:13:49.021
It's empty.

98
00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:50.112
Aim it.

99
00:13:56.018 --> 00:13:57.351
Check the magazine.

100
00:14:01.656 --> 00:14:02.824
How?

101
00:14:08.163 --> 00:14:12.477
One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.


102
00:14:12.567 --> 00:14:15.279
The other one's going backwards.

103
00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:17.738
Can you tell which is which?

104
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.452
How about now?

105
00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:24.255
It's inverted.
Its entropy runs backwards.


106
00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:27.192
So, to our eyes,
its movement is reversed.


107
00:14:27.282 --> 00:14:30.661
We think it's a type of inverse
radiation triggered by nuclear fission.


108
00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:31.729
You didn't make it?

109
00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:33.232
No, we don't know how yet.

110
00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:34.632
So, where'd it come from?

111
00:14:34.722 --> 00:14:37.069
Someone's manufacturing them
in the future.


112
00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:39.138
They're streaming back at us.

113
00:14:39.228 --> 00:14:40.561
Try it.

114
00:14:47.568 --> 00:14:49.570
You have to have dropped it.

115
00:15:01.415 --> 00:15:03.427
How can it move before
I touch it?


116
00:15:03.517 --> 00:15:05.863
From your point of view,
you caught it.


117
00:15:05.953 --> 00:15:08.332
But from the bullet's point
of view, you dropped it.


118
00:15:08.422 --> 00:15:10.068
But cause comes before effect.

119
00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:13.337
No, that's just the way
we see time.


120
00:15:13.427 --> 00:15:15.274
Well, what about free will?

121
00:15:15.364 --> 00:15:17.708
That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.


122
00:15:17.798 --> 00:15:20.902
Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.


123
00:15:22.137 --> 00:15:23.905
Don't try to understand it.

124
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.507
Feel it.

125
00:15:36.918 --> 00:15:38.020
Instinct.

126
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.922
Got it.

127
00:15:45.593 --> 00:15:47.795
Why does it feel so strange?

128
00:15:48.729 --> 00:15:51.109
You're not shooting the bullet,

129
00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:52.700
you're catching it.

130
00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:55.870
Whoa.

131
00:15:58.206 --> 00:16:00.351
I've seen this type
of ammunition before.


132
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:01.419
In the field?

133
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:02.687
I was almost hit.

134
00:16:02.777 --> 00:16:05.090
Then you were exceedingly lucky.

135
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.227
An inverted bullet passing through
your body would be devastating.


136
00:16:08.317 --> 00:16:09.684
Not pretty.

137
00:16:11.253 --> 00:16:12.830
These look like today's.

138
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.665
They may have been made today
and inverted years from now.


139
00:16:14.755 --> 00:16:16.701
Where did you get them?

140
00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:19.770
Came with the wall. I was assigned it,
like all the material I'm studying here.


141
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.539
Do you have an analysis
on the metals?


142
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:23.474
Sure. Why?

143
00:16:23.564 --> 00:16:26.078
The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made.


144
00:16:26.168 --> 00:16:27.668
Look...

145
00:16:28.803 --> 00:16:30.671
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

146
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.686
The bullet may not seem like much,
but it's a simple machine.


147
00:16:35.776 --> 00:16:38.846
Lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder.

148
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.159
If they can invert that,

149
00:16:41.249 --> 00:16:42.928
I see no reason they couldn't
invert pretty much anything.


150
00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:46.098
Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.


151
00:16:46.188 --> 00:16:50.025
An inverted weapon might be
able to affect our past as well.


152
00:16:53.462 --> 00:16:58.143
Now that we know what to look for, we're
finding more and more inverted material.


153
00:16:58.233 --> 00:17:01.069
Remnants of complex objects.

154
00:17:04.406 --> 00:17:05.906
What do you think we're seeing?

155
00:17:07.775 --> 00:17:10.278
The detritus of a coming war.

156
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:31.276
Yep?
We live in a twilight world.


157
00:17:31.366 --> 00:17:33.678
No friends at dusk.
I was told you left the building.


158
00:17:33.768 --> 00:17:35.314
Even the dead need allies.

159
00:17:35.404 --> 00:17:36.982
Specifically?

160
00:17:37.072 --> 00:17:40.218
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjay Singh.


161
00:17:40.308 --> 00:17:41.819
Singh?

162
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:43.587
He never leaves his house.
And his house is...


163
00:17:43.677 --> 00:17:44.722
His house.
Yes, it is.


164
00:17:44.812 --> 00:17:46.391
I'm looking right at it.

165
00:17:46.481 --> 00:17:48.226
I'll see who's on deck.

166
00:17:48.316 --> 00:17:50.318
Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.

167
00:18:02.596 --> 00:18:03.874
It seems you need an introduction

168
00:18:03.964 --> 00:18:07.235
to a prominent Mumbai local
on short notice.


169
00:18:08.437 --> 00:18:09.647
I'm Neil.

170
00:18:09.737 --> 00:18:11.772
I need an audience with
Sanjay Singh.


171
00:18:13.908 --> 00:18:15.187
That's not possible.

172
00:18:15.277 --> 00:18:18.190
Ten minutes tops.

173
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.691
Time isn't the problem.

174
00:18:20.781 --> 00:18:23.085
It's getting out alive
that's the problem.


175
00:18:25.786 --> 00:18:29.301
Would you take a child hostage?
A woman?


176
00:18:29.391 --> 00:18:30.668
If I had to.

177
00:18:30.758 --> 00:18:32.670
I'm not looking to make much
noise here.


178
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.738
Yes?

179
00:18:33.828 --> 00:18:36.864
Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.

180
00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:40.235
What?

181
00:18:41.103 --> 00:18:42.347
You never drink on the job.

182
00:18:42.437 --> 00:18:43.915
You're well informed.

183
00:18:44.005 --> 00:18:47.685
Well, pays to be in our profession.

184
00:18:47.775 --> 00:18:50.112
Well, I prefer soda water.

185
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.781
No, you don't.

186
00:18:54.682 --> 00:18:56.627
How's your parachuting?

187
00:18:56.717 --> 00:18:58.463
I broke an ankle during basic training.

188
00:18:58.553 --> 00:19:01.799
Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.


189
00:19:01.889 --> 00:19:03.201
It's bungee-jumpable.

190
00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:05.536
I don't think "Bungee-jumpable"
is a word.


191
00:19:05.626 --> 00:19:08.863
It may not be a word, but it may
be our only way out of that place.


192
00:19:09.964 --> 00:19:12.033
Or into it, for that matter.

193
00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:54.009
I know you're tired.
I'm also very tired.


194
00:20:56.671 --> 00:20:58.517
Stay back.

195
00:20:58.607 --> 00:21:01.685
I was almost taken out by a very
unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.


196
00:21:01.775 --> 00:21:04.722
I want to know who supplied it.

197
00:21:04.812 --> 00:21:06.558
My name is Sanjay.

198
00:21:06.648 --> 00:21:08.726
And you are?

199
00:21:08.816 --> 00:21:10.685
No chitchat?

200
00:21:10.784 --> 00:21:12.297
There's no one at the other end.

201
00:21:12.387 --> 00:21:13.989
No one who's gonna help you, anyway.

202
00:21:15.956 --> 00:21:17.791
Don't let it get cold.

203
00:21:19.661 --> 00:21:21.439
Why should I know who
supplied it?


204
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:24.708
Combination of metals
is unique to India.


205
00:21:24.798 --> 00:21:25.843
If it's from India, it's from you.

206
00:21:25.933 --> 00:21:27.711
Fine assumption.
Deduction.


207
00:21:27.801 --> 00:21:29.381
Deduction, then.

208
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:30.982
Look, my friend...

209
00:21:31.072 --> 00:21:34.019
guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.


210
00:21:34.109 --> 00:21:36.711
I'm not the man they send to negotiate.

211
00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:39.891
Or the man they send to make deals.

212
00:21:39.981 --> 00:21:43.118
But I am the man people talk to.

213
00:21:44.785 --> 00:21:46.298
I can't.

214
00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:47.499
I can't tell you.

215
00:21:47.589 --> 00:21:49.100
You're an arms dealer, Friend.

216
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.802
This may be the easiest trigger
I've ever had to pull.


217
00:21:51.892 --> 00:21:53.704
To say anything about a client

218
00:21:53.794 --> 00:21:56.774
would violate the tenets
he lives by.


219
00:21:56.864 --> 00:22:00.035
If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me.


220
00:22:00.735 --> 00:22:02.047
Everything.

221
00:22:02.137 --> 00:22:05.217
Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.


222
00:22:05.307 --> 00:22:08.852
Sanjay, make a drink
for our guest, please.


223
00:22:08.942 --> 00:22:10.522
Cheers.

224
00:22:10.612 --> 00:22:12.657
Priya.
Hmm.


225
00:22:12.747 --> 00:22:14.626
This is your operation?

226
00:22:14.716 --> 00:22:18.029
A masculine front in
a man's world has its uses.


227
00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:20.465
The dealer you're looking for
is Andrei Sator.


228
00:22:20.555 --> 00:22:21.700
The Russian oligarch.

229
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.734
You know him?
Not personally.


230
00:22:23.824 --> 00:22:25.736
Made his billions in gas.

231
00:22:25.826 --> 00:22:29.507
Moved to London. Said to be on
the outs with Moscow.


232
00:22:29.597 --> 00:22:31.343
Very good.

233
00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:34.379
Except the gas he made his billions
from was actually plutonium.


234
00:22:34.469 --> 00:22:38.283
None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.


235
00:22:38.373 --> 00:22:40.885
When I sold him the rounds,
they were perfectly ordinary.


236
00:22:40.975 --> 00:22:43.321
So how did he get them inverted?

237
00:22:43.411 --> 00:22:46.224
We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker.


238
00:22:46.314 --> 00:22:48.516
Between our time and the future.

239
00:22:49.917 --> 00:22:51.663
He can communicate with the future?

240
00:22:51.753 --> 00:22:53.198
We all do, don't we?

241
00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:55.100
E-mails, credit cards, texts.

242
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.137
Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.


243
00:22:59.227 --> 00:23:03.174
The question is,
can the future speak back?


244
00:23:03.264 --> 00:23:05.543
And I'm supposed to find out?

245
00:23:05.633 --> 00:23:09.813
To get anywhere near Sator would
take a fresh-faced protagonist.


246
00:23:09.903 --> 00:23:12.550
And you are fresh as a daisy.

247
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.784
Get close.

248
00:23:13.874 --> 00:23:16.121
Find out what he's receiving
and how.


249
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:18.156
Is it safe to involve
British Intelligence?


250
00:23:18.246 --> 00:23:20.881
I have a contact
who's out of Sator's reach.


251
00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:29.157
You must've had a plan for
getting out.


252
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.925
Not one I love.

253
00:23:54.883 --> 00:23:56.728
May I help you, Sir?

254
00:23:56.818 --> 00:23:58.229
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

255
00:23:58.319 --> 00:24:00.999
I presume you mean
Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.


256
00:24:01.089 --> 00:24:02.200
Presume away.

257
00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.058
If you'll follow me.

258
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.999
Started without you.
Hope you don't mind.


259
00:24:11.633 --> 00:24:13.001
I'll catch up.

260
00:24:13.802 --> 00:24:14.913
Same for me, please.

261
00:24:15.003 --> 00:24:16.081
I'll send the waiter.

262
00:24:16.171 --> 00:24:18.550
No, just pass on the order.

263
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.453
I gather you have an interest
in a certain Russian national.


264
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:24.456
Anglo-Russian.
So I have to watch my step.


265
00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:27.292
Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.


266
00:24:27.382 --> 00:24:30.628
I've warned them
he's feeding them rubbish...


267
00:24:30.718 --> 00:24:31.963
But they don't seem to care.

268
00:24:32.053 --> 00:24:33.665
Tell me about him.

269
00:24:33.755 --> 00:24:37.202
I assume you're familiar with
the Soviet-era secret cities.


270
00:24:37.292 --> 00:24:41.172
Closed cities, not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.


271
00:24:41.262 --> 00:24:44.776
Most of them have been opened
up and renamed as regular towns.


272
00:24:44.866 --> 00:24:46.644
Not the one Sator grew up in.

273
00:24:46.734 --> 00:24:48.246
Stalsk-12.

274
00:24:48.336 --> 00:24:51.116
In the '70s, it had a
population of about 200,000.


275
00:24:51.206 --> 00:24:52.517
Thought to be abandoned.

276
00:24:52.607 --> 00:24:54.285
Abandoned?

277
00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:57.756
Some kind of accident. After which
it was used for underground tests.


278
00:24:57.846 --> 00:25:00.558
Two weeks ago, same day as
the Kiev opera siege,


279
00:25:00.648 --> 00:25:03.928
we spotted a detonation
in northern Siberia,


280
00:25:04.018 --> 00:25:06.331
just where Stalsk-12 was.

281
00:25:06.421 --> 00:25:09.834
Sator emerged from
this blank spot on the map


282
00:25:09.924 --> 00:25:11.736
with ambition...

283
00:25:11.826 --> 00:25:14.973
And enough money to buy his way
into the British establishment.


284
00:25:15.063 --> 00:25:16.508
Through his wife?

285
00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:19.144
Katherine Barton.
Oldest niece of Sir Frederick Barton.


286
00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:21.613
She works at Shipley's.
Met Sator at an auction.


287
00:25:21.703 --> 00:25:22.647
A happy marriage?

288
00:25:22.737 --> 00:25:24.816
Practically estranged.

289
00:25:24.906 --> 00:25:25.984
Well, how do I get to Sator?

290
00:25:26.074 --> 00:25:27.619
Well, through her, of course.

291
00:25:27.709 --> 00:25:30.278
You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.


292
00:25:30.812 --> 00:25:32.013
Hardly.

293
00:25:32.881 --> 00:25:35.083
We have an ace in the hole.

294
00:25:37.585 --> 00:25:40.165
You're carrying a Goya
in a Harrods bag.


295
00:25:40.255 --> 00:25:42.867
It's a fake by a Spaniard
named Arepo.


296
00:25:42.957 --> 00:25:46.204
One of two we've confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.


297
00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:47.907
What happened to the other one?

298
00:25:47.997 --> 00:25:50.775
It turned up at Shipley's.
Authenticated by Katherine Barton.


299
00:25:50.865 --> 00:25:52.177
Put on auction.

300
00:25:52.267 --> 00:25:53.913
And who do you think bought it?

301
00:25:54.003 --> 00:25:54.979
Her husband?

302
00:25:55.069 --> 00:25:56.304
Mmm-hmm.

303
00:25:57.505 --> 00:25:59.317
Does she know it's a forgery?

304
00:25:59.407 --> 00:26:00.618
Oh, it's hard to say.

305
00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:04.856
Rumor has it that
she and Arepo were close.


306
00:26:04.946 --> 00:26:06.247
Uh-huh.

307
00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:09.060
Look, no offense,

308
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.087
but in this world, when someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...


309
00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:16.501
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

310
00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:18.269
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

311
00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:21.095
Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.


312
00:26:21.796 --> 00:26:23.508
Can I recommend a tailor?

313
00:26:23.598 --> 00:26:24.876
I'll manage.

314
00:26:24.966 --> 00:26:27.078
You British don't have a
monopoly on snobbery, you know.


315
00:26:27.168 --> 00:26:28.413
Well, not a monopoly.

316
00:26:28.503 --> 00:26:30.672
More of a controlling interest.

317
00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:33.685
Could you box that up for me?

318
00:26:33.775 --> 00:26:34.876
Certainly not.

319
00:26:36.077 --> 00:26:38.146
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

320
00:27:10.745 --> 00:27:12.213
How can I help, Sir?

321
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.530
Sorry, I wasn't notified
of any appointments, Mr...


322
00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.621
Goya.

323
00:27:20.822 --> 00:27:22.267
Mr. Goya.

324
00:27:22.357 --> 00:27:24.592
No. I'm told you're
the person to see about Goya.


325
00:27:27.161 --> 00:27:28.596
That's extraordinary.

326
00:27:33.768 --> 00:27:35.269
What's it worth?

327
00:27:36.304 --> 00:27:38.206
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

328
00:27:39.474 --> 00:27:42.410
Lots of work to do
before any kind of valuation.


329
00:27:43.645 --> 00:27:47.425
Provenance, microscopic
examination, X-rays.


330
00:27:47.515 --> 00:27:49.784
But what does your heart tell you?

331
00:27:53.788 --> 00:27:55.723
Sir, where did you say
you acquired this drawing?


332
00:27:56.858 --> 00:27:57.925
Tomas Arepo.

333
00:28:01.295 --> 00:28:04.776
I bought my Goya for cents on a
dollar from an irate Swiss banker.


334
00:28:04.866 --> 00:28:07.745
Traced it back to Arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain


335
00:28:07.835 --> 00:28:10.648
when he told me who paid top dollar
for another one of his pictures.


336
00:28:10.738 --> 00:28:13.117
Your husband.
Where's your bargain?


337
00:28:13.207 --> 00:28:14.319
Your drawing's an obvious fake.

338
00:28:14.409 --> 00:28:16.120
My drawing's a very good fake.

339
00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.589
You know that better than anyone.

340
00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:19.614
The information's the bargain.

341
00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:23.094
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?


342
00:28:23.184 --> 00:28:26.431
He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.


343
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:28.000
If you and I
were to make an arrangement...

344
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.367
Arrangement?

345
00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:30.970
You mean blackmail.

346
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.337
Don't be afraid of the word.

347
00:28:32.427 --> 00:28:34.472
My husband isn't.

348
00:28:34.562 --> 00:28:36.341
I'm sorry to tell you
he got there first.


349
00:28:36.431 --> 00:28:38.376
He knows? And he's never done
anything about it?


350
00:28:38.466 --> 00:28:39.577
Why would he?

351
00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:41.245
He paid $9 million for it.

352
00:28:41.335 --> 00:28:43.815
Barely cover the cost of the
holiday he just forced us on.


353
00:28:43.905 --> 00:28:45.473
Where'd you go, Mars?

354
00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:50.254
Vietnam, on our yacht.
His yacht.


355
00:28:50.344 --> 00:28:53.691
You've got the suit.
The shoes, the watch.


356
00:28:53.781 --> 00:28:56.494
Think you're a little
out of your depth.


357
00:28:56.584 --> 00:28:59.764
People who've amassed fortunes,
like your husband's,


358
00:28:59.854 --> 00:29:03.725
generally aren't okay with
being cheated out of any of it.


359
00:29:09.131 --> 00:29:11.599
The drawing is his hold over me.

360
00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:20.742
He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.


361
00:29:22.877 --> 00:29:24.622
He controls me.

362
00:29:24.712 --> 00:29:27.358
My contact with my son.
Everything.


363
00:29:27.448 --> 00:29:31.019
Leaving would never have been
easy but now it's impossible.


364
00:29:32.286 --> 00:29:34.455
You can't fight.

365
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.992
Just beg.

366
00:29:38.994 --> 00:29:41.106
In Vietnam,
I tried to love him again.


367
00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:44.575
Thought if there was love there,
he might give me my son back.


368
00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:48.813
We sat on that bloody boat
watching the sunsets,


369
00:29:48.903 --> 00:29:51.315
imitating some earlier time
in our lives.


370
00:29:51.405 --> 00:29:54.352
He seemed happy, so I asked him.

371
00:29:54.442 --> 00:29:56.454
And he made me an offer.

372
00:29:56.544 --> 00:29:59.413
He'd let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.


373
00:30:02.917 --> 00:30:06.230
I expressed myself.
I took Max ashore.


374
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.034
He called us, contrite.

375
00:30:09.124 --> 00:30:10.668
And when we got back,

376
00:30:10.758 --> 00:30:12.071
I glimpsed some other woman
diving off the boat,


377
00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:13.694
and he'd vanished.

378
00:30:16.597 --> 00:30:18.476
I never felt such envy.

379
00:30:18.566 --> 00:30:20.045
You don't seem the jealous type.

380
00:30:20.135 --> 00:30:21.736
Of her freedom.

381
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.087
You know how I dream
of just diving off that boat?


382
00:30:28.177 --> 00:30:29.610
But you share a son.

383
00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:32.690
That's my life now.

384
00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.792
Did you know the drawing
was a fake?


385
00:30:34.882 --> 00:30:35.860
No.

386
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.396
Tomas and I became close,
maybe too close.


387
00:30:38.486 --> 00:30:39.797
I failed.

388
00:30:39.887 --> 00:30:42.333
Andrei can't conceive of
failure, only betrayal.


389
00:30:42.423 --> 00:30:44.002
But I didn't betray my husband.

390
00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:46.671
Retrospect, maybe I missed
my chance.


391
00:30:46.761 --> 00:30:48.539
And he let Arepo walk free.

392
00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:50.641
If you'd actually met Arepo
as you claimed,


393
00:30:50.731 --> 00:30:53.377
you'd understand
he no longer walks anywhere.


394
00:30:53.467 --> 00:30:54.612
We spoke on the phone.

395
00:30:54.702 --> 00:30:56.848
He can't do that either.

396
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:59.017
Where's the drawing?
Why?


397
00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:00.551
Get me an introduction.

398
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:02.253
I'll take the drawing
out of the equation.


399
00:31:02.343 --> 00:31:05.690
No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.


400
00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.993
I might just be your second chance.

401
00:31:08.083 --> 00:31:09.928
No, I don't need redemption.

402
00:31:10.018 --> 00:31:11.485
At betrayal.

403
00:31:17.358 --> 00:31:18.559
Friends of your husband's?

404
00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.939
You knew this was going to happen?

405
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:23.242
Don't worry, they won't kill you.

406
00:31:23.332 --> 00:31:26.577
Andrei dislikes tangling with local
law enforcement on that level.


407
00:31:26.667 --> 00:31:29.014
You must've really not liked
the look of me.


408
00:31:29.104 --> 00:31:31.016
The look of you's fine.

409
00:31:31.106 --> 00:31:34.318
It's best to get to the nasty part
before I care one way or the other.


410
00:31:34.408 --> 00:31:35.954
There's a number
in your left coat pocket.


411
00:31:36.044 --> 00:31:37.478
Don't call from home.

412
00:31:38.846 --> 00:31:40.748
You won't be taking my call.

413
00:31:42.516 --> 00:31:45.220
I might surprise you.

414
00:32:15.117 --> 00:32:17.752
I ordered my hot sauce
an hour ago.


415
00:32:20.454 --> 00:32:21.856
Can we get going?

416
00:32:35.469 --> 00:32:37.216
Please?

417
00:32:37.306 --> 00:32:38.706
He wants you to see.

418
00:33:04.632 --> 00:33:07.002
And he gets what he wants.

419
00:33:13.442 --> 00:33:15.643
Not always, apparently.

420
00:33:21.682 --> 00:33:23.295
Anna says we're going to Pompeii

421
00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:24.528
and see lava.

422
00:33:24.618 --> 00:33:26.697
We will.
We'll go together.


423
00:33:26.787 --> 00:33:28.689
I'll be there, too!

424
00:33:48.377 --> 00:33:49.944
Told you I'd surprise you.

425
00:33:51.512 --> 00:33:52.590
He's a cute kid.

426
00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.881
He's everything.

427
00:33:56.251 --> 00:33:57.795
Where's the drawing?

428
00:33:57.885 --> 00:33:59.998
Oslo. At the airport.

429
00:34:00.088 --> 00:34:01.465
The airport?

430
00:34:01.555 --> 00:34:03.801
Do you know what a Freeport is?

431
00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:06.405
A storage facility
for art that was acquired...


432
00:34:06.495 --> 00:34:08.572
But not yet taxed.

433
00:34:08.662 --> 00:34:10.775
We started a network.

434
00:34:10.865 --> 00:34:14.445
Rotas, this construction company,
built them. I brought in the clients.


435
00:34:14.535 --> 00:34:16.614
The facilities are tax havens.

436
00:34:16.704 --> 00:34:19.151
The clients can view their
investments without importing them,


437
00:34:19.241 --> 00:34:21.485
so they avoid paying tax.

438
00:34:21.575 --> 00:34:23.922
It's sorta like a transit
lounge for art?


439
00:34:24.012 --> 00:34:25.556
Art, antiquities.

440
00:34:25.646 --> 00:34:27.558
Anything of value, really.
Anything?


441
00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:29.194
Anything legal.

442
00:34:29.284 --> 00:34:31.430
But it's not unlike
the Swiss banking system.


443
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.232
Opaque.

444
00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:37.936
As I'm sure you are aware, most
Freeports are just warehouses.


445
00:34:38.026 --> 00:34:40.604
But here we ensure that
you can actually enjoy...


446
00:34:40.694 --> 00:34:43.308
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.


447
00:34:43.398 --> 00:34:45.444
And this way to the vaults!

448
00:34:45.534 --> 00:34:47.179
Guessing?
Guessing?


449
00:34:47.269 --> 00:34:49.613
We make trips there four,
five times a year.


450
00:34:49.703 --> 00:34:52.150
To view art?
And whatever it is he does.


451
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.652
Turns out art's of no
importance to Andrei.


452
00:34:54.742 --> 00:34:56.577
But the Freeports are.

453
00:34:57.912 --> 00:35:00.058
The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.


454
00:35:00.148 --> 00:35:02.961
Each vault a separate structure
within the others.


455
00:35:03.051 --> 00:35:05.820
Damage to one structure
won't compromise the others.


456
00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:21.735
Some of our clients opt for
biometric access, straight in...


457
00:35:23.138 --> 00:35:24.548
Off the tarmac.

458
00:35:24.638 --> 00:35:25.906
From the terminal?

459
00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.686
From their private planes.

460
00:35:28.776 --> 00:35:30.821
Of course.

461
00:35:30.911 --> 00:35:33.591
Our logistics department
ships to and from


462
00:35:33.681 --> 00:35:34.792
any other Freeport in the world

463
00:35:34.882 --> 00:35:36.895
without customs inspection.

464
00:35:36.985 --> 00:35:38.796
What are you hoping to find
in there?


465
00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:39.965
You really wanna know?

466
00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.900
I'm not sure.

467
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:44.336
Bring some lead lined gloves.

468
00:35:44.426 --> 00:35:45.803
Jesus.

469
00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:47.272
It's nuclear.

470
00:35:47.362 --> 00:35:49.207
When you're on the tour,

471
00:35:49.297 --> 00:35:51.832
pay attention to the fire precautions.

472
00:35:53.135 --> 00:35:54.212
Documents are vulnerable to...

473
00:35:54.302 --> 00:35:55.813
Fire? Absolutely!

474
00:35:55.903 --> 00:35:57.916
No, I was going to say water
damage from the sprinkler systems.


475
00:35:58.006 --> 00:36:00.085
We don't use sprinklers.

476
00:36:00.175 --> 00:36:02.921
The facility is flooded
with halide gas,


477
00:36:03.011 --> 00:36:05.180
displacing all the air
within seconds.


478
00:36:06.448 --> 00:36:07.492
Can you show me?

479
00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:09.650
If I did, we'd suffocate.

480
00:36:10.818 --> 00:36:11.997
What about the staff?

481
00:36:12.087 --> 00:36:13.697
Halide only fills the vaults,

482
00:36:13.787 --> 00:36:15.599
they just have to get
into either corridor,


483
00:36:15.689 --> 00:36:17.668
and there is a 10 second warning.

484
00:36:17.758 --> 00:36:19.670
At least you give them 10 seconds.

485
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.543
Well, Sir, our clients use us
because we have no priorities


486
00:36:24.633 --> 00:36:26.278
above their property.

487
00:36:26.368 --> 00:36:27.212
Blimey.

488
00:36:27.302 --> 00:36:28.547
All doors are fireproof.

489
00:36:28.637 --> 00:36:31.682
Hydraulic closers, simple key
and electronic triggers.


490
00:36:31.772 --> 00:36:33.584
Surprisingly easy
once there's a lockdown.


491
00:36:33.674 --> 00:36:35.120
Why a lockdown?

492
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.889
Power switches to fail safes,
sealing the outer doors,


493
00:36:37.979 --> 00:36:40.848
but inner doors
revert to factory settings.


494
00:36:41.715 --> 00:36:42.894
And pickable locks.

495
00:36:42.984 --> 00:36:44.329
Hmm.
It's child's play, really.


496
00:36:44.419 --> 00:36:45.497
Child's play?

497
00:36:45.587 --> 00:36:47.065
They're inside airport security.

498
00:36:47.155 --> 00:36:49.700
They have to worry about climate
control, not armed raids.


499
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.770
So, how do we get enough
firepower through the perimeter


500
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.728
to trigger the lockdown procedure?

501
00:36:56.164 --> 00:36:57.842
Back wall of the Freeport.

502
00:36:57.932 --> 00:36:59.234
You've got something?

503
00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:02.314
Not gonna like it.

504
00:37:02.404 --> 00:37:04.116
You wanna crash a plane?

505
00:37:04.206 --> 00:37:06.650
Well, not from the air.
Don't be so dramatic.


506
00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.221
I want to run
a jet off the taxiway

507
00:37:09.311 --> 00:37:11.946
and breach the rear wall
and start a fire.


508
00:37:13.682 --> 00:37:15.860
Well, how big a plane?

509
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:20.021
Well, that part is a little dramatic.

510
00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:22.800
This is Mahir.

511
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:23.969
His team'll work the plane.

512
00:37:24.059 --> 00:37:25.403
There can't be passengers.

513
00:37:25.493 --> 00:37:26.972
Norsk Freight.

514
00:37:27.062 --> 00:37:29.307
They use the hangar on the
west side of the Freeport.


515
00:37:29.397 --> 00:37:31.775
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?


516
00:37:31.865 --> 00:37:33.545
We pop the slides, chuck 'em off.

517
00:37:33.635 --> 00:37:34.880
On the move?

518
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.770
What's the problem?
They'll be fine.


519
00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:39.217
Well, it seems bold.

520
00:37:39.307 --> 00:37:42.087
Bold I'm fine with. I thought
you were gonna say nuts.


521
00:37:42.177 --> 00:37:43.421
And if you get caught?

522
00:37:43.511 --> 00:37:44.456
We won't.

523
00:37:44.546 --> 00:37:46.291
And if you do?

524
00:37:46.381 --> 00:37:48.493
Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died,


525
00:37:48.583 --> 00:37:51.762
so swift extradition
then lost in the system.


526
00:37:51.852 --> 00:37:53.465
It'll barely make the news.

527
00:37:53.555 --> 00:37:56.034
Oh, depends on the size
of your explosion.


528
00:37:56.124 --> 00:37:58.537
Well, actually, the gold bars
might get some play.


529
00:37:58.627 --> 00:38:00.005
Gold bars?

530
00:38:00.095 --> 00:38:01.973
Norsk Freight ships Treasury
gold once a month.


531
00:38:02.063 --> 00:38:05.410
Blow the back.
Drop it out on the runway.


532
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.204
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.


533
00:38:11.872 --> 00:38:14.352
The space in the center of
the Pentagon is too big.


534
00:38:14.442 --> 00:38:16.121
There's something there.

535
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:19.247
Can't figure it out,
it's just not marked.


536
00:38:20.615 --> 00:38:21.825
That's 45 seconds.

537
00:38:21.915 --> 00:38:22.961
Ample.

538
00:38:23.051 --> 00:38:24.419
Won't you be running?

539
00:38:26.087 --> 00:38:27.465
All right, it's your turn.

540
00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:28.856
Start packing.

541
00:38:46.708 --> 00:38:47.941
Gentlemen, if you would,
through the detector, please.


542
00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.258
Sir?

543
00:38:53.348 --> 00:38:54.693
Oh.

544
00:38:54.783 --> 00:38:55.916
And, Sir.

545
00:39:04.392 --> 00:39:06.870
I can offer you, perhaps,
a coffee, water?


546
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.607
No, I'll take an espresso.

547
00:39:08.697 --> 00:39:10.475
Sir?
No, thank you.


548
00:39:10.565 --> 00:39:12.200
Excellent.

549
00:39:21.009 --> 00:39:22.887
Is everybody on this plane vegetarian?

550
00:39:22.977 --> 00:39:25.180
Because all I got here is vegetarian.

551
00:39:27.015 --> 00:39:29.361
So that looks like meat,

552
00:39:29.451 --> 00:39:32.030
but I think that looks vegetarian.
I think they both look vegetarian.


553
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.456
I don't really know.
It's confusing, ya know?


554
00:39:35.323 --> 00:39:36.191
Okay.

555
00:39:43.498 --> 00:39:44.932
This way, Gentlemen.

556
00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:03.084
Gentlemen, your assigned compartment.

557
00:40:13.762 --> 00:40:15.997
Carry on. Not the radio.

558
00:40:22.637 --> 00:40:24.005
Let's go.

559
00:40:39.888 --> 00:40:41.656
Uh...

560
00:40:54.335 --> 00:40:55.336
Yoga.

561
00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:02.310
Let's go! Now!

562
00:41:32.774 --> 00:41:33.741
Go, go, go!

563
00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.546
Right. Um...

564
00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.395
You said 10 seconds, right?

565
00:43:48.476 --> 00:43:50.311
There's someone in here with us.

566
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.295
Need a hand?
Actually, yes.


567
00:44:35.356 --> 00:44:36.557
Don't touch them!

568
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:38.726
The hell happened here?

569
00:44:44.232 --> 00:44:46.234
It hasn't happened yet.

570
00:47:05.274 --> 00:47:07.019
Don't kill him!

571
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:09.710
We need to know if we've been compromised.

572
00:47:11.846 --> 00:47:13.892
Why are you here?

573
00:47:13.982 --> 00:47:16.061
Who are you?

574
00:47:16.151 --> 00:47:18.053
How'd you know we'd be here?

575
00:47:33.467 --> 00:47:35.369
We need to go.

576
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:42.720
What happened to the other guy?

577
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.080
Took care of him.

578
00:47:59.594 --> 00:48:01.272
Well, I've seen too much.

579
00:48:01.362 --> 00:48:03.976
I'm still alive, which must
mean you've decided to trust me.


580
00:48:04.066 --> 00:48:05.676
Or maybe I lost my edge.

581
00:48:05.766 --> 00:48:07.768
Edge is still intact.

582
00:48:09.503 --> 00:48:11.405
There's a cold war.

583
00:48:11.806 --> 00:48:12.985
Nuclear?

584
00:48:13.075 --> 00:48:14.309
Temporal.

585
00:48:15.576 --> 00:48:16.754
Time travel?

586
00:48:16.844 --> 00:48:18.023
No.

587
00:48:18.113 --> 00:48:21.049
Technology that can invert
an object's entropy.


588
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:23.929
You mean reverse chronology.

589
00:48:24.019 --> 00:48:26.265
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion
that a positron is an electron


590
00:48:26.355 --> 00:48:27.565
moving backwards in time?

591
00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:29.333
Sure, that's exactly
what I meant.


592
00:48:29.423 --> 00:48:31.003
I have a master's in physics.

593
00:48:31.093 --> 00:48:32.403
Well, try and keep up.

594
00:48:32.493 --> 00:48:34.106
The implications of this are...

595
00:48:34.196 --> 00:48:35.207
Beyond secret.

596
00:48:35.297 --> 00:48:36.909
Then why'd you bring me in?

597
00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:39.377
I thought we'd find a drawing
and a couple boxes of bullets.


598
00:48:39.467 --> 00:48:41.013
Not as surprised as I was.

599
00:48:41.103 --> 00:48:44.917
I'm going back to Mumbai
to get some answers.


600
00:48:45.007 --> 00:48:48.542
I'll set you up as a go between.
But remember, to you...


601
00:48:49.477 --> 00:48:51.856
It's all about plutonium.

602
00:48:51.946 --> 00:48:53.457
And when we're done,
they'll kill you.


603
00:48:53.547 --> 00:48:56.394
Won't you have to do that anyway?

604
00:48:56.484 --> 00:48:58.230
I'd rather it be my decision.

605
00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.187
So would I.

606
00:49:00.088 --> 00:49:01.156
I think.

607
00:49:13.201 --> 00:49:14.069
Your work?

608
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.416
What did you find in the vaults?

609
00:49:18.506 --> 00:49:21.286
Two antagonists. One inverted.

610
00:49:21.376 --> 00:49:25.389
We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.


611
00:49:25.479 --> 00:49:26.992
Both emerged at the same moment?

612
00:49:27.082 --> 00:49:28.559
Yeah.

613
00:49:28.649 --> 00:49:29.951
They were the same person.

614
00:49:31.219 --> 00:49:33.332
Sator's built a turnstile
in that vault.


615
00:49:33.422 --> 00:49:34.665
Turnstile?

616
00:49:34.755 --> 00:49:37.102
A machine for inverting.

617
00:49:37.192 --> 00:49:40.138
You've told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.


618
00:49:40.228 --> 00:49:41.372
It hasn't.

619
00:49:41.462 --> 00:49:42.740
He's been given it by the future.

620
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:44.209
For what?

621
00:49:44.299 --> 00:49:46.834
You have the best chance of
finding out.


622
00:49:48.403 --> 00:49:49.747
Have you met him?
I was close.


623
00:49:49.837 --> 00:49:52.184
What if you have something he needs?

624
00:49:52.274 --> 00:49:53.618
Such as?

625
00:49:53.708 --> 00:49:55.853
Plutonium-241.

626
00:49:55.943 --> 00:49:59.224
Sator tried to lift the only
loose 241 from under a CIA team


627
00:49:59.314 --> 00:50:01.859
at the opera siege in Kiev.

628
00:50:01.949 --> 00:50:03.295
He got the team.

629
00:50:03.385 --> 00:50:04.462
Not the 241.

630
00:50:04.552 --> 00:50:05.496
Who did?

631
00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:07.765
Ukrainian Security Services.

632
00:50:07.855 --> 00:50:10.102
It's moving to Tallinn in a week.

633
00:50:10.192 --> 00:50:13.238
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons grade plutonium


634
00:50:13.328 --> 00:50:15.773
is unacceptable, Priya.

635
00:50:15.863 --> 00:50:17.342
I'm just gonna take him out.

636
00:50:17.432 --> 00:50:19.477
No, no, no.
Sator has to stay alive.


637
00:50:19.567 --> 00:50:22.513
He has to stay alive until
we know his part in things.


638
00:50:22.603 --> 00:50:23.982
Leverage the situation,

639
00:50:24.072 --> 00:50:26.318
without losing control of the 241.

640
00:50:26.408 --> 00:50:27.953
It's too dangerous.

641
00:50:28.043 --> 00:50:30.188
A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can kill billions,


642
00:50:30.278 --> 00:50:33.225
is nothing compared with what will
happen if we don't stop Sator.


643
00:50:33.315 --> 00:50:34.825
From doing what?

644
00:50:34.915 --> 00:50:38.819
We are being attacked by the future.

645
00:50:39.988 --> 00:50:43.058
And Sator's helping.
You have to find out how.


646
00:50:58.873 --> 00:51:01.153
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?


647
00:51:01.243 --> 00:51:03.221
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.


648
00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:05.190
You destroyed it?

649
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:07.359
I didn't think you'd want it back.

650
00:51:07.449 --> 00:51:08.459
Does he know?

651
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:10.128
Not yet. So sit tight.

652
00:51:10.218 --> 00:51:11.964
Sit tight?

653
00:51:12.054 --> 00:51:14.099
Every day my son spends with that
monster, he thinks a little less of me.


654
00:51:14.189 --> 00:51:15.267
It won't be long.

655
00:51:15.357 --> 00:51:17.993
In the meantime, introduce me.

656
00:51:18.493 --> 00:51:20.238
As what?

657
00:51:20.328 --> 00:51:22.374
I'm a former first secretary from
the American Embassy in Riyadh.


658
00:51:22.464 --> 00:51:24.209
We met at a party last June.

659
00:51:24.299 --> 00:51:25.876
We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June.


660
00:51:25.966 --> 00:51:28.280
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.

661
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.149
Salmon was on the printed menu.
Swapped for sea bass on the night.


662
00:51:31.239 --> 00:51:33.051
Sator left early.
That's when we met.


663
00:51:33.141 --> 00:51:34.719
I came into Shipley's in London.

664
00:51:34.809 --> 00:51:36.455
You ran into me here

665
00:51:36.545 --> 00:51:38.056
and wanna show me your yacht.

666
00:51:38.146 --> 00:51:40.491
He'll think we're having an affair.

667
00:51:40.581 --> 00:51:41.625
Then he'll wanna meet me.

668
00:51:41.715 --> 00:51:42.727
Or have you killed.

669
00:51:42.817 --> 00:51:45.263
Let me worry about that.

670
00:51:45.353 --> 00:51:46.954
Did I look worried?

671
00:51:48.523 --> 00:51:49.767
Sleeps 70 with crew.

672
00:51:49.857 --> 00:51:52.503
Two helicopters.
Missile defenses.


673
00:51:52.593 --> 00:51:54.039
Afraid of pirates?

674
00:51:54.129 --> 00:51:56.640
Andrei lives playing one
government off the other.


675
00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:58.477
The day they turn, that's his refuge.

676
00:51:58.567 --> 00:51:59.844
May I join you?

677
00:51:59.934 --> 00:52:02.414
Not sure Volkov's taking
passengers just now.


678
00:52:02.504 --> 00:52:04.239
Then we'll take mine.

679
00:52:38.206 --> 00:52:39.207
Max!

680
00:52:40.774 --> 00:52:42.978
Who's the American?

681
00:52:44.279 --> 00:52:45.623
He's a friend.

682
00:52:45.713 --> 00:52:48.527
The man from Shipley's.

683
00:52:48.617 --> 00:52:51.019
Who you tried to have beaten up.

684
00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:54.422
I ask again, who is he?

685
00:52:56.992 --> 00:52:59.637
We met in Riyadh last June
at the American Embassy.


686
00:52:59.727 --> 00:53:02.107
Good with fists for a diplomat.

687
00:53:02.197 --> 00:53:04.242
Paranoia's your department, Andrei.

688
00:53:04.332 --> 00:53:07.678
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.


689
00:53:07.768 --> 00:53:08.947
Max?

690
00:53:09.037 --> 00:53:12.317
He's visiting Pompeii and Herculaneum.

691
00:53:12.407 --> 00:53:13.919
You just sent him off?

692
00:53:14.009 --> 00:53:16.620
I promised him I'd go with him.

693
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.913
I explained you were busy.

694
00:53:20.382 --> 00:53:22.816
With your friend.

695
00:53:43.737 --> 00:53:45.683
Hey, easy, Fella.

696
00:53:45.773 --> 00:53:48.143
Where I'm from,
you buy me dinner first.


697
00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:01.156
Mr. Sator.
Don't bother.


698
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:05.060
Just tell me if you've
slept with my wife yet.


699
00:54:05.527 --> 00:54:07.262
Uh... No.

700
00:54:08.263 --> 00:54:09.264
Not yet.

701
00:54:10.565 --> 00:54:12.367
How would you like to die?

702
00:54:13.134 --> 00:54:13.979
Old.

703
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:16.804
You chose the wrong profession.

704
00:54:18.306 --> 00:54:20.218
There's a walled garden up
the road.


705
00:54:20.308 --> 00:54:22.753
We are going to take you there,
cut your throat.


706
00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:26.024
Not across.
In the middle, like a hole.


707
00:54:26.114 --> 00:54:28.859
Then we take your balls
and we stuff them in the cut,


708
00:54:28.949 --> 00:54:30.518
block the windpipe.

709
00:54:31.186 --> 00:54:32.430
Complex.

710
00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.832
It's very gratifying
to watch a man you don't like


711
00:54:34.922 --> 00:54:39.004
try to pull his own balls out
of his throat before he chokes.


712
00:54:39.094 --> 00:54:40.704
Is this how you treat
all your guests?


713
00:54:40.794 --> 00:54:42.364
We're finished.

714
00:54:46.401 --> 00:54:47.402
Do you like opera?

715
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:55.420
Well?

716
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:56.877
Not here.

717
00:55:00.282 --> 00:55:01.026
You sail?

718
00:55:01.116 --> 00:55:02.627
I've messed around on boats.

719
00:55:02.717 --> 00:55:05.520
Be on the dock at 8:00 ready
to do more than mess around.


720
00:55:06.154 --> 00:55:07.155
8:00 a.m.

721
00:55:21.469 --> 00:55:23.915
Max has missed
too much school this year.


722
00:55:24.005 --> 00:55:25.617
I'm taking him back to England.

723
00:55:25.707 --> 00:55:26.952
The school won't be okay with
him missing so much of the term.


724
00:55:27.042 --> 00:55:29.888
Yes, they will.
Can I finish?


725
00:55:29.978 --> 00:55:31.755
You have all the trappings
of a king.


726
00:55:31.845 --> 00:55:34.392
We both know you're a grubby
little man playing power games


727
00:55:34.482 --> 00:55:36.518
with a wife who doesn't love
you anymore.


728
00:55:37.719 --> 00:55:39.254
You seem...

729
00:55:40.355 --> 00:55:42.190
Spirited today.

730
00:55:43.725 --> 00:55:46.227
Do I?
Yes, you do.


731
00:55:52.233 --> 00:55:54.579
Were you worried it had been destroyed?

732
00:55:54.669 --> 00:55:58.984
Rest assured, instinct told me
to remove it from the vault.


733
00:55:59.074 --> 00:56:01.609
I've always had instincts
about the future.


734
00:56:03.211 --> 00:56:06.448
That's how I built this life
you no longer value.


735
00:56:21.596 --> 00:56:23.331
Sailing or diving?

736
00:56:40.482 --> 00:56:41.983
Rising!

737
00:57:06.307 --> 00:57:08.920
What do you know about opera?

738
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:12.090
In 2008, a remote
Russian missile station


739
00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:14.893
was overwhelmed and held for
a week.


740
00:57:14.983 --> 00:57:16.628
When the station was retaken,

741
00:57:16.718 --> 00:57:20.655
241 on one warhead was three
quarters of a kilo lighter.


742
00:57:24.726 --> 00:57:26.571
The missing 241

743
00:57:26.661 --> 00:57:29.840
surfaced at the opera house
siege in Kiev on the 14th.


744
00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:31.932
Coming about!

745
00:57:49.784 --> 00:57:52.153
What do you propose?

746
00:57:52.921 --> 00:57:53.898
Partnership.

747
00:57:53.988 --> 00:57:55.834
I wouldn't partner with you.

748
00:57:55.924 --> 00:58:00.171
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.


749
00:58:00.261 --> 00:58:02.374
Someone in the arms trade,
with training,


750
00:58:02.464 --> 00:58:04.175
who knows how to cover his tracks.

751
00:58:04.265 --> 00:58:05.577
Not that shocking.

752
00:58:05.667 --> 00:58:07.912
For an intelligence agent.

753
00:58:08.002 --> 00:58:10.038
Right!

754
00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:14.175
Burn in hell, Andrei.

755
00:58:21.382 --> 00:58:23.194
You can't jibe a boat like this!

756
00:58:23.284 --> 00:58:24.686
You can if you have to.

757
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.426
Kat...
Why didn't you let him drown?


758
00:58:54.516 --> 00:58:55.994
I need him.

759
00:58:56.084 --> 00:58:57.162
What, to sell guns?

760
00:58:57.252 --> 00:58:58.496
I'm not who you think I am.

761
00:58:58.586 --> 00:58:59.697
Well, that I know.

762
00:58:59.787 --> 00:59:02.300
He showed me the drawing.

763
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:04.736
I'm sorry.
I had to get close to him.


764
00:59:04.826 --> 00:59:06.906
I don't know what you think
your husband does...


765
00:59:06.996 --> 00:59:09.641
Oh, we both know he's an arms dealer.

766
00:59:09.731 --> 00:59:11.109
He's so much more.

767
00:59:11.199 --> 00:59:13.011
What, then?

768
00:59:13.101 --> 00:59:16.237
Andrei Sator holds all of our
lives in his hands, not just yours.


769
00:59:24.178 --> 00:59:25.857
Mr. Sator wants to see you.

770
00:59:25.947 --> 00:59:26.814
Okay.

771
00:59:27.582 --> 00:59:29.394
Now.

772
00:59:29.484 --> 00:59:31.686
Uh, he wants to see me
without pants?


773
00:59:37.759 --> 00:59:39.370
Trust me.
Save it.


774
00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.729
I'm not falling for it twice.

775
00:59:43.932 --> 00:59:45.400
You have a better option?

776
00:59:48.202 --> 00:59:50.148
Whatever it takes
to get what you want.


777
00:59:50.238 --> 00:59:52.840
Not a second's thought
for me or my son.


778
00:59:57.345 --> 00:59:59.647
What do you think
he's gonna do to me now?


779
01:00:11.125 --> 01:00:12.660
Try not to use it.

780
01:00:14.662 --> 01:00:16.531
On anyone.

781
01:00:21.769 --> 01:00:23.171
Enough.

782
01:00:26.574 --> 01:00:29.611
See? Pulse of a man half my age.

783
01:00:32.814 --> 01:00:34.515
Drink with me.

784
01:00:36.351 --> 01:00:38.763
It seems I now owe you my life.

785
01:00:38.853 --> 01:00:39.899
It's nothing.

786
01:00:39.989 --> 01:00:42.001
My life is not nothing.

787
01:00:42.091 --> 01:00:44.702
And I don't like to be in debt.

788
01:00:44.792 --> 01:00:46.471
Then pay me.

789
01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:48.796
No retribution
against your wife.


790
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:54.502
You think she released my harness?

791
01:00:57.872 --> 01:01:00.151
It was my own mistake.

792
01:01:00.241 --> 01:01:02.220
Then help me steal the 241.

793
01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:04.556
I need resources.
It's weapons grade plutonium.


794
01:01:04.646 --> 01:01:06.691
That means special handling,
containment facilities...


795
01:01:06.781 --> 01:01:08.316
I know what it means.

796
01:01:10.385 --> 01:01:13.588
You lecture me about radiation?

797
01:01:14.389 --> 01:01:16.200
Andrei Sator,

798
01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:21.139
digging plutonium from the
rubble of my city as a teenager.


799
01:01:21.229 --> 01:01:22.296
Where?

800
01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:26.868
Stalsk-12.

801
01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:29.470
My home.

802
01:01:32.206 --> 01:01:36.744
One part of a warhead exploded at
ground level, scattering the others.


803
01:01:38.379 --> 01:01:41.182
They needed people to find
the plutonium.


804
01:01:43.118 --> 01:01:45.064
It became my first contract.

805
01:01:45.154 --> 01:01:48.456
Nobody else even bid. They
thought it was a death sentence.


806
01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:52.493
But...

807
01:01:53.996 --> 01:01:56.964
One man's probability of death...

808
01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:03.237
Is another man's possibility
for a life.


809
01:02:05.673 --> 01:02:08.786
I staked my claim in the New Russia.

810
01:02:08.876 --> 01:02:13.658
Even now, my company is the only
one to operate in the ruins.


811
01:02:13.748 --> 01:02:16.794
The 241 is being transported
through northern Europe,


812
01:02:16.884 --> 01:02:22.300
on its way to the long term
nuclear storage depot in Trieste.


813
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.759
I'm told you have resources
in Tallinn.


814
01:02:29.464 --> 01:02:31.843
Stay with us tonight.

815
01:02:31.933 --> 01:02:33.634
I insist.

816
01:03:00.996 --> 01:03:02.141
What do you want?

817
01:03:02.231 --> 01:03:04.432
We're going to talk about today.

818
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.244
No, we're not.

819
01:03:06.334 --> 01:03:07.535
No?

820
01:03:09.337 --> 01:03:10.715
We'll see.

821
01:03:10.805 --> 01:03:12.417
Don't think for a second
you can treat me


822
01:03:12.507 --> 01:03:14.575
like you treat your other women.

823
01:03:16.444 --> 01:03:18.579
And, uh...

824
01:03:19.447 --> 01:03:22.326
How do you imagine...

825
01:03:22.416 --> 01:03:23.828
I treat these other women, huh?

826
01:03:23.918 --> 01:03:26.531
You think I force them into conversation?

827
01:03:26.621 --> 01:03:28.167
You wanna be quiet, fine.

828
01:03:28.257 --> 01:03:29.957
You can bite down on that.

829
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.597
Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.


830
01:03:37.832 --> 01:03:40.112
Is fear and pain enough, Andrei?

831
01:03:40.202 --> 01:03:41.412
That's all I have to offer you.

832
01:03:41.502 --> 01:03:43.148
Well, that will have to do, then.

833
01:03:43.238 --> 01:03:45.984
Why didn't you just let me go?

834
01:03:46.074 --> 01:03:48.076
Because...

835
01:03:50.078 --> 01:03:54.782
If I can't have you...

836
01:03:56.251 --> 01:03:59.864
No one else can.

837
01:03:59.954 --> 01:04:02.800
And if you touch me,
I scream so loud he hears.


838
01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:04.769
You think I let him interfere?

839
01:04:04.859 --> 01:04:07.705
If he tried,
you'd have to kill him.


840
01:04:07.795 --> 01:04:08.830
End of deal.

841
01:04:10.398 --> 01:04:12.800
So you leave me alone.

842
01:04:14.335 --> 01:04:16.337
Not now!

843
01:06:35.943 --> 01:06:40.215
Ninety eight.
Not bad for such exertion.


844
01:06:50.858 --> 01:06:52.995
He was at the window.

845
01:06:54.628 --> 01:06:55.998
I was curious.

846
01:06:57.099 --> 01:07:00.245
My property shouldn't concern you.

847
01:07:00.335 --> 01:07:01.846
Who are you?

848
01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:03.916
How do you come by your
information about the opera?


849
01:07:04.006 --> 01:07:08.387
You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.


850
01:07:08.477 --> 01:07:11.924
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds
of the market for fissile material.


851
01:07:12.014 --> 01:07:15.559
They're usually buying, not selling.

852
01:07:15.649 --> 01:07:18.363
But we do live in a twilight world.

853
01:07:18.453 --> 01:07:19.965
Is that Whitman? Pretty.

854
01:07:20.055 --> 01:07:22.024
Next warning's a bullet
in the brain.


855
01:07:24.426 --> 01:07:26.671
No balls in my throat?

856
01:07:26.761 --> 01:07:29.341
There will be no time
for such things...


857
01:07:29.431 --> 01:07:30.909
In Tallinn.

858
01:07:30.999 --> 01:07:34.947
You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.


859
01:07:35.037 --> 01:07:36.238
No.

860
01:07:39.074 --> 01:07:42.720
I spring the material.
You pay me off.


861
01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.522
Your wife does the exchange.

862
01:07:44.612 --> 01:07:45.856
I never involve her in my business.

863
01:07:45.946 --> 01:07:48.160
Yeah, that's why I trust her.

864
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.962
Put him ashore.

865
01:07:50.052 --> 01:07:51.430
How do I contact you?

866
01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.663
You don't.

867
01:07:52.753 --> 01:07:54.256
How do you advance me the funds?

868
01:07:57.958 --> 01:08:01.163
Handle the plutonium
better than that.


869
01:08:11.106 --> 01:08:12.583
What did you find on the gold?

870
01:08:12.673 --> 01:08:14.485
No franks, no mold marks. Nothing.

871
01:08:14.575 --> 01:08:16.888
How?
Dead drops.


872
01:08:16.978 --> 01:08:20.025
He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,


873
01:08:20.115 --> 01:08:23.661
then digs it up to collect the
inverted materials they sent.


874
01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:26.664
Seemingly instantaneous.
Where's he bury it?


875
01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:29.767
Some place that won't be
discovered for centuries.


876
01:08:29.857 --> 01:08:31.903
What did the soil samples show?

877
01:08:31.993 --> 01:08:34.306
Northern Europe, Asia.

878
01:08:34.396 --> 01:08:35.840
Radioactive.

879
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.766
Everything salvaged from Oslo's
been shipped here.


880
01:08:39.468 --> 01:08:40.811
Why am I here?

881
01:08:40.901 --> 01:08:44.282
I don't trust anyone else
to assess the pieces.


882
01:08:44.372 --> 01:08:47.019
Via convoy through downtown,
what's the thinking?


883
01:08:47.109 --> 01:08:49.955
Crowded.
Unpredictable traffic patterns.


884
01:08:50.045 --> 01:08:52.357
It's almost impossible
to plan an ambush.


885
01:08:52.447 --> 01:08:54.625
They have a point.

886
01:08:54.715 --> 01:08:56.194
Is the convoy monitored
from the air?


887
01:08:56.284 --> 01:08:59.931
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn,
in come the cavalry.


888
01:09:00.021 --> 01:09:01.299
We need big guns.

889
01:09:01.389 --> 01:09:03.592
Guns that make the point
without being fired.


890
01:09:03.691 --> 01:09:07.205
We need a fast car that doesn't
look fast. Four heavy vehicles.


891
01:09:07.295 --> 01:09:08.839
All different.

892
01:09:08.929 --> 01:09:11.876
Bus, coach, 18 wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.


893
01:09:11.966 --> 01:09:15.247
Most of all, we have to set this
up with nothing in the record.


894
01:09:15.337 --> 01:09:17.282
Nothing electronic, nothing paper.

895
01:09:17.372 --> 01:09:21.719
I don't want Sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.


896
01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:24.845
His ignorance is our only protection.

897
01:10:01.983 --> 01:10:03.385
You see, Kat?

898
01:10:04.352 --> 01:10:06.754
Some of my favorites.

899
01:10:07.989 --> 01:10:12.703
Singed but, uh, salvageable,
wouldn't you say?


900
01:10:12.793 --> 01:10:15.440
That's not my area of expertise.
Ah, that's right.


901
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:19.877
You would never have anything
to do with such things.


902
01:10:19.967 --> 01:10:22.581
But this is where our worlds collide.

903
01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:24.182
What is this, Andrei?

904
01:10:24.272 --> 01:10:27.475
You know perfectly well
what it is, Kat.


905
01:10:30.312 --> 01:10:32.090
The filthy business

906
01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:35.460
that put those clothes on your
back and our boy in his school,


907
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:38.086
that you thought you could
negotiate your way around.


908
01:10:47.861 --> 01:10:49.141
Time to go.

909
01:10:49.231 --> 01:10:50.741
I'm not going anywhere with him.

910
01:10:50.831 --> 01:10:51.966
Look at me!

911
01:10:53.501 --> 01:10:55.679
And understand,

912
01:10:55.769 --> 01:10:58.250
you don't negotiate with a tiger.

913
01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:02.387
You admire a tiger
until he turns on you


914
01:11:02.477 --> 01:11:06.847
and you feel its true
fucking nature!


915
01:11:07.449 --> 01:11:08.849
Don't.

916
01:11:09.684 --> 01:11:11.919
You stay right there.

917
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:17.692
Green. Two minutes.

918
01:11:41.316 --> 01:11:42.594
You are not going to kill me.

919
01:11:42.684 --> 01:11:44.529
I already tried.

920
01:11:44.619 --> 01:11:45.964
You pushed me off a boat.

921
01:11:46.054 --> 01:11:48.033
You are not going to shoot me
in cold blood.


922
01:11:48.123 --> 01:11:50.402
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

923
01:11:50.492 --> 01:11:53.961
No, but you're not angry enough.

924
01:11:55.397 --> 01:11:59.100
Because anger scars over into despair.

925
01:12:00.968 --> 01:12:03.338
I look in your eyes...

926
01:12:04.739 --> 01:12:06.441
I see despair.

927
01:12:10.245 --> 01:12:13.525
Vengeful bitch! 
Living off me!

928
01:12:13.615 --> 01:12:15.260
Thinking that you're better!

929
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:16.418
Enough!

930
01:12:40.841 --> 01:12:43.511
Tell me everything as it happens.

931
01:12:45.814 --> 01:12:47.881
Seal me this side.

932
01:13:04.965 --> 01:13:07.445
Yellow, 60 seconds.

933
01:13:07.535 --> 01:13:09.170
60. Check.

934
01:13:23.785 --> 01:13:26.531
Blue, 45 seconds.

935
01:13:26.621 --> 01:13:28.323
Blue, 45, check.

936
01:13:44.773 --> 01:13:47.275
Okay, Red.
Coming to you.


937
01:14:02.323 --> 01:14:05.226
Watch everything.
Give me all the details.


938
01:14:50.271 --> 01:14:51.706
All right, everyone set?

939
01:14:57.579 --> 01:14:59.581
And five...

940
01:15:00.482 --> 01:15:02.016
Four...

941
01:15:02.784 --> 01:15:03.751
Three...

942
01:15:04.853 --> 01:15:06.054
Two...

943
01:15:07.989 --> 01:15:09.190
One.

944
01:15:31.746 --> 01:15:32.780
Go, Yellow!

945
01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:37.897
We got a problem!

946
01:15:37.987 --> 01:15:40.788
Backup, we need backup! Shit!

947
01:17:47.181 --> 01:17:49.183
Check the radio chatter.

948
01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.346
I've seen samples of encapsulation
in every weapons class.


949
01:18:08.436 --> 01:18:10.015
This is not one of them.

950
01:18:10.105 --> 01:18:11.773
That's what he's after.

951
01:18:15.376 --> 01:18:16.554
Can't understand this.

952
01:18:16.644 --> 01:18:18.222
You said you spoke Estonian.

953
01:18:18.312 --> 01:18:19.892
It's not Estonian.

954
01:18:19.982 --> 01:18:21.249
It's backwards.

955
01:18:26.387 --> 01:18:27.789
The hell is that?

956
01:18:43.038 --> 01:18:44.505
Go, go, go!

957
01:19:30.918 --> 01:19:32.898
Don't give it to him.

958
01:19:32.988 --> 01:19:34.165
This isn't plutonium.

959
01:19:34.255 --> 01:19:35.623
It's worse than that,
God damn it!


960
01:19:54.243 --> 01:19:55.476
Sorry.

961
01:20:11.425 --> 01:20:12.593
He's getting away.

962
01:20:14.395 --> 01:20:15.540
He left her in the car!

963
01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:18.066
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!

964
01:20:31.445 --> 01:20:32.814
Pull up alongside!

965
01:20:48.429 --> 01:20:50.898
Come on, come on. Closer!

966
01:20:54.602 --> 01:20:56.404
Keep it steady, keep it steady!

967
01:20:58.307 --> 01:20:59.975
Hurry up!

968
01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:02.710
Please!

969
01:21:38.746 --> 01:21:41.616
All right, sit tight.
I'm calling the cavalry.


970
01:21:42.383 --> 01:21:43.818
What cavalry?

971
01:22:47.915 --> 01:22:50.185
If you are not telling
the truth, she dies.


972
01:22:52.753 --> 01:22:54.199
I don't know what you're
talkin' about.


973
01:22:54.289 --> 01:22:56.624
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?


974
01:22:58.693 --> 01:23:00.305
Who told you that?
Just tell me now,


975
01:23:00.395 --> 01:23:01.662
is it really in the BMW?

976
01:23:03.065 --> 01:23:04.009
I don't know.

977
01:23:04.099 --> 01:23:05.466
Tell me or I'll shoot her again!

978
01:23:07.369 --> 01:23:08.412
Leave her alone!

979
01:23:08.502 --> 01:23:09.847
Kill him!

980
01:23:09.937 --> 01:23:11.806
I don't have time to negotiate.

981
01:23:17.511 --> 01:23:18.623
Listen to me!
Three.


982
01:23:18.713 --> 01:23:19.690
I can help you.

983
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:21.193
Help me!
Two.


984
01:23:21.283 --> 01:23:22.294
Please!

985
01:23:22.384 --> 01:23:23.617
Don't!
One.


986
01:23:27.788 --> 01:23:29.424
Next one's a bullet to the head.

987
01:23:31.126 --> 01:23:32.570
No!
One.


988
01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:34.339
Two. Three.

989
01:23:34.429 --> 01:23:35.763
Okay! Okay.

990
01:23:36.431 --> 01:23:38.609
The car. The BMW.

991
01:23:38.699 --> 01:23:40.012
I left it in the BMW.

992
01:23:40.102 --> 01:23:41.269
We're going to check this is real.

993
01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:45.918
It's in the glove box!

994
01:23:46.008 --> 01:23:48.010
Where did you leave it?

995
01:23:48.843 --> 01:23:50.788
Car or fire truck, which one?

996
01:23:50.878 --> 01:23:53.557
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.


997
01:23:53.647 --> 01:23:54.749
I already told you.

998
01:23:55.816 --> 01:23:57.262
I believe you.

999
01:23:57.352 --> 01:23:59.553
You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy...


1000
01:24:12.067 --> 01:24:13.511
Clear!

1001
01:24:13.601 --> 01:24:15.280
Wheeler, go check the other side.

1002
01:24:15.370 --> 01:24:16.614
You two.

1003
01:24:16.704 --> 01:24:17.950
Where did he go?

1004
01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.041
The past.

1005
01:24:41.997 --> 01:24:43.342
It's in the glove box!

1006
01:24:43.432 --> 01:24:46.368
We're going to check this is real.

1007
01:24:49.004 --> 01:24:51.482
Three, two, one.
Okay, okay...


1008
01:24:51.572 --> 01:24:53.375
Next one's a bullet to the head.

1009
01:24:54.742 --> 01:24:56.989
No! No!
One.


1010
01:24:57.079 --> 01:24:58.991
Listen to me.
Two.


1011
01:24:59.081 --> 01:25:00.158
Three.

1012
01:25:00.248 --> 01:25:01.826
I can help you.

1013
01:25:01.916 --> 01:25:03.929
I don't have time to negotiate.

1014
01:25:04.019 --> 01:25:05.353
Tell me or I'll shoot her again.

1015
01:25:07.022 --> 01:25:08.266
Leave her alone!
Tell me now,


1016
01:25:08.356 --> 01:25:09.567
is it really in the BMW?

1017
01:25:09.657 --> 01:25:11.103
I don't know.

1018
01:25:11.193 --> 01:25:13.604
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?


1019
01:25:13.694 --> 01:25:15.240
Who told you that?

1020
01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:17.309
If you're not telling
the truth, she dies.


1021
01:25:17.399 --> 01:25:19.600
I don't know what you're
talking about.


1022
01:25:31.712 --> 01:25:33.148
Medic!
Check in.


1023
01:25:34.516 --> 01:25:36.194
She's been shot?

1024
01:25:36.284 --> 01:25:38.153
Bring her back, this side.

1025
01:25:39.588 --> 01:25:41.289
Was she shot with an inverted round?

1026
01:25:46.694 --> 01:25:48.863
This is Ives. He's one of us.

1027
01:25:50.332 --> 01:25:52.277
"Us"! Who are these guys?

1028
01:25:52.367 --> 01:25:54.479
Priya's. Ours.

1029
01:25:54.569 --> 01:25:56.214
How did Sator know about the ambush?

1030
01:25:56.304 --> 01:25:57.916
It's posterity.

1031
01:25:58.006 --> 01:25:59.985
An ambush in the middle of the
street can't stay out of the records.


1032
01:26:00.075 --> 01:26:03.288
Bullshit! He knew every move
we made! Every one of 'em.


1033
01:26:03.378 --> 01:26:04.588
Somebody talked. Who was it?

1034
01:26:04.678 --> 01:26:06.657
Was it you?
No. No.


1035
01:26:06.747 --> 01:26:08.793
At every stage,
you've known too much.


1036
01:26:08.883 --> 01:26:11.852
I'm going to ask you again.

1037
01:26:12.587 --> 01:26:14.788
Did you talk?

1038
01:26:16.324 --> 01:26:17.802
Nobody talked.

1039
01:26:17.892 --> 01:26:20.328
They're running a temporal
pincer movement.


1040
01:26:21.062 --> 01:26:22.240
A what?

1041
01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:26.511
The pincer movement.
But not in space, in time.


1042
01:26:26.601 --> 01:26:28.612
Half his team moves forward
through the event.


1043
01:26:28.702 --> 01:26:31.917
He monitors them, and then attacks
at the end moving backwards,


1044
01:26:32.007 --> 01:26:33.552
knowing everything.

1045
01:26:33.642 --> 01:26:35.653
Except for where I stashed
the plutonium.


1046
01:26:35.743 --> 01:26:37.322
Which isn't really plutonium,
is it?


1047
01:26:37.412 --> 01:26:38.890
I told you it
was what he was after.

1048
01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:41.682
And you just told him where
it was.


1049
01:26:42.417 --> 01:26:44.662
I lied.

1050
01:26:44.752 --> 01:26:47.532
Jesus.
You lied about it?


1051
01:26:47.622 --> 01:26:52.037
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.


1052
01:26:52.127 --> 01:26:54.573
Lying is standard operating procedure.

1053
01:26:54.663 --> 01:26:55.840
It's spread too far.

1054
01:26:55.930 --> 01:26:56.908
Meaning what?

1055
01:26:56.998 --> 01:26:58.243
She's gonna die.

1056
01:26:58.333 --> 01:27:00.011
Standard operating procedure.

1057
01:27:00.101 --> 01:27:01.913
Can't you help her?
Can we do something?


1058
01:27:02.003 --> 01:27:04.916
Can't we stabilize the inverse
radiation by inverting the patient?


1059
01:27:05.006 --> 01:27:06.118
Takes days.

1060
01:27:06.208 --> 01:27:07.886
Let's go.

1061
01:27:07.976 --> 01:27:10.288
We took control of this machine
minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's.


1062
01:27:10.378 --> 01:27:12.656
How long is she gonna live
on this side?


1063
01:27:12.746 --> 01:27:14.392
Three hours, tops.

1064
01:27:14.482 --> 01:27:15.927
I'm taking her through.

1065
01:27:16.017 --> 01:27:18.130
I'm not gonna let her die.
I'll take my chances.


1066
01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.831
There's no way of
bringing you back.


1067
01:27:20.921 --> 01:27:22.234
We find another machine.

1068
01:27:22.324 --> 01:27:23.857
A week ago? Where?

1069
01:27:25.759 --> 01:27:27.205
Oslo.

1070
01:27:27.295 --> 01:27:29.840
That facility's inside
an airport security perimeter.


1071
01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:31.675
It's impregnable.

1072
01:27:31.765 --> 01:27:33.811
Mmm... It wasn't last week.

1073
01:27:33.901 --> 01:27:35.413
We're going in.

1074
01:27:35.503 --> 01:27:36.770
You might as well help us.

1075
01:27:37.938 --> 01:27:39.117
This is a proving window.

1076
01:27:39.207 --> 01:27:40.552
As you approach the turnstile,

1077
01:27:40.642 --> 01:27:42.454
if you don't see yourself
in the proving window,


1078
01:27:42.544 --> 01:27:43.622
do not enter the machine.

1079
01:27:43.712 --> 01:27:45.090
Why not?

1080
01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.491
If you don't see yourself
reverse exit a machine,


1081
01:27:46.581 --> 01:27:47.626
then you ain't getting out.

1082
01:27:47.716 --> 01:27:50.262
Is that gonna work?
Yeah.


1083
01:27:50.352 --> 01:27:52.063
See for yourself.

1084
01:27:52.153 --> 01:27:54.222
There's your answer. Let's go.

1085
01:28:18.846 --> 01:28:20.192
She's stabilizing slowly.

1086
01:28:20.282 --> 01:28:21.859
I'll clean and close,
but the rest is time.


1087
01:28:21.949 --> 01:28:23.228
How long does she need?

1088
01:28:23.318 --> 01:28:26.864
Four, five days.
A week to be sure.


1089
01:28:26.954 --> 01:28:28.533
Hey, Neil.
Find a way to get us to Oslo.


1090
01:28:28.623 --> 01:28:29.823
I'm going back out there.

1091
01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.572
To do what?

1092
01:28:33.662 --> 01:28:35.473
To stop Sator from getting away
with whatever it is I just gave him.


1093
01:28:35.563 --> 01:28:37.841
You didn't.
You lied about where it was.


1094
01:28:37.931 --> 01:28:39.611
Wait.

1095
01:28:39.701 --> 01:28:40.979
You're going out there for her.

1096
01:28:41.069 --> 01:28:42.713
He threatened to kill her
in the past.


1097
01:28:42.803 --> 01:28:44.639
If he does,
what happens to her here?


1098
01:28:45.906 --> 01:28:47.785
That's unknowable.

1099
01:28:47.875 --> 01:28:50.055
If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.


1100
01:28:50.145 --> 01:28:51.623
What do you believe?

1101
01:28:51.713 --> 01:28:53.857
What's happened's happened.

1102
01:28:53.947 --> 01:28:56.628
We need to save her, here and now.

1103
01:28:56.718 --> 01:29:00.398
If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.


1104
01:29:00.488 --> 01:29:02.733
Don't let them take her back
through there.


1105
01:29:02.823 --> 01:29:03.668
Okay?

1106
01:29:03.758 --> 01:29:05.427
We can't stay here.

1107
01:29:06.361 --> 01:29:08.006
We don't have a lot of time.

1108
01:29:08.096 --> 01:29:11.142
So why don't you find us a nice,
cozy shipping container


1109
01:29:11.232 --> 01:29:13.545
that's just come off a ship
from Oslo?


1110
01:29:13.635 --> 01:29:15.080
This is cowboy shit.

1111
01:29:15.170 --> 01:29:16.615
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into


1112
01:29:16.705 --> 01:29:18.016
if you go through that door.

1113
01:29:18.106 --> 01:29:19.850
Well, I'm going,
so any tips would be welcome.


1114
01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.720
Wheeler, brief him.

1115
01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:23.588
You'll need your own air.

1116
01:29:23.678 --> 01:29:26.691
Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.


1117
01:29:26.781 --> 01:29:28.193
Number one rule:

1118
01:29:28.283 --> 01:29:30.462
Don't come into contact
with your forward self.


1119
01:29:30.552 --> 01:29:33.398
It's the whole point of these
barriers and protective suits.


1120
01:29:33.488 --> 01:29:34.666
We don't have time.

1121
01:29:34.756 --> 01:29:37.235
Well, if your particles
come into contact...


1122
01:29:37.325 --> 01:29:38.303
What?

1123
01:29:38.393 --> 01:29:39.404
Annihilation.

1124
01:29:39.494 --> 01:29:41.072
That would be bad, right?

1125
01:29:41.162 --> 01:29:45.143
When you exit the air lock,
take a moment to orient yourself.


1126
01:29:45.233 --> 01:29:47.512
Things will feel strange.

1127
01:29:47.602 --> 01:29:49.614
When you run,
the wind will be at your back.


1128
01:29:49.704 --> 01:29:52.984
You encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes


1129
01:29:53.074 --> 01:29:54.852
as the transfer of heat is reversed.

1130
01:29:54.942 --> 01:29:59.691
Gravity will feel normal but appear
reversed for the world around you.


1131
01:29:59.781 --> 01:30:02.560
You may experience distortions
in your vision and hearing.


1132
01:30:02.650 --> 01:30:03.928
This is normal.

1133
01:30:04.018 --> 01:30:05.563
Can I drive a car?
Cowboy shit.


1134
01:30:05.653 --> 01:30:07.265
I can't vouch for the handling.

1135
01:30:07.355 --> 01:30:09.734
Friction and wind resistance
are reversed.


1136
01:30:09.824 --> 01:30:11.936
You are inverted.
The world is not.


1137
01:30:12.026 --> 01:30:13.772
Was the transponder on the case?

1138
01:30:13.862 --> 01:30:15.440
We've tossed that case.

1139
01:30:15.530 --> 01:30:18.143
I'm moving backwards.
It's the ball I have to follow.


1140
01:30:18.233 --> 01:30:20.168
Give me the reader.

1141
01:30:24.038 --> 01:30:25.440
Okay.

1142
01:30:26.274 --> 01:30:27.908
You ready?

1143
01:33:19.414 --> 01:33:22.360
The material's not in the case.

1144
01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:25.587
Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.


1145
01:33:26.254 --> 01:33:27.866
He was lying.

1146
01:33:27.956 --> 01:33:29.767
It wasn't in the BMW.

1147
01:33:29.857 --> 01:33:30.858
So, where is it?

1148
01:34:17.072 --> 01:34:19.050
I saw the handoff.

1149
01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:22.153
You made me shoot her for nothing.

1150
01:34:22.243 --> 01:34:26.324
You did get my pulse above 130,
no one's done that before.


1151
01:34:26.414 --> 01:34:28.050
Not even my wife.

1152
01:34:57.512 --> 01:35:00.381
You left Ives and his
team a hell of a cleanup.


1153
01:35:01.416 --> 01:35:04.228
Heat transfer was reversed.

1154
01:35:04.318 --> 01:35:06.130
You might be the first case
of hypothermia


1155
01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:08.333
from a gasoline explosion in history.

1156
01:35:08.423 --> 01:35:11.359
At this point, nothing surprises.

1157
01:35:12.894 --> 01:35:14.039
We're headed back to Oslo?

1158
01:35:14.129 --> 01:35:16.240
In a Rotas shipping container.

1159
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:18.176
He's got the material, Neil.

1160
01:35:18.266 --> 01:35:20.278
I handed it to him on a plate.

1161
01:35:20.368 --> 01:35:21.879
I warned you...

1162
01:35:21.969 --> 01:35:23.114
What's happened's happened.

1163
01:35:23.204 --> 01:35:25.116
I get it now.

1164
01:35:25.206 --> 01:35:27.909
But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half truths.


1165
01:35:28.943 --> 01:35:30.188
That's not fair.

1166
01:35:30.278 --> 01:35:32.523
You were a part of this
before we met.


1167
01:35:32.613 --> 01:35:33.892
Were you working for Priya?

1168
01:35:33.982 --> 01:35:34.893
No.

1169
01:35:34.983 --> 01:35:36.694
Who recruited you, Neil?

1170
01:35:36.784 --> 01:35:39.764
It can't possibly do you any
good to know that right now.


1171
01:35:39.854 --> 01:35:44.769
When this is over, if we're still
standing, and you still care,


1172
01:35:44.859 --> 01:35:47.762
then you can hear my life
story, okay?


1173
01:35:50.032 --> 01:35:51.609
I'm sorry I involved you.

1174
01:35:51.699 --> 01:35:53.511
You need to tell me what's
going on.


1175
01:35:53.601 --> 01:35:56.414
Apparently Neil here knows
more about it than I do.


1176
01:35:56.504 --> 01:35:58.149
Good luck, Pal.

1177
01:35:58.239 --> 01:36:00.551
By telling Kat anything, we're
compromising her in Priya's eyes.


1178
01:36:00.641 --> 01:36:03.254
In Priya's eyes,
she's already compromised.


1179
01:36:03.344 --> 01:36:05.690
She has the right to know
why she might die.


1180
01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:06.724
Am I gonna die?

1181
01:36:06.814 --> 01:36:08.626
Not if we have something
to say about it.


1182
01:36:08.716 --> 01:36:09.861
And we do.

1183
01:36:09.951 --> 01:36:12.163
Who are you?

1184
01:36:12.253 --> 01:36:16.257
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...


1185
01:36:22.064 --> 01:36:24.109
The material's not in the case.

1186
01:36:24.199 --> 01:36:27.735
Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the Hypocenter.


1187
01:36:36.811 --> 01:36:37.845
You injured?

1188
01:36:43.484 --> 01:36:45.686
What's the algorithm, Neil?

1189
01:36:47.455 --> 01:36:50.725
241 is one section of it.
One out of nine.


1190
01:36:51.926 --> 01:36:54.238
It's a formula rendered into
physical form


1191
01:36:54.328 --> 01:36:56.841
so it can't be copied or communicated.

1192
01:36:56.931 --> 01:36:58.900
It's a black box with one function.

1193
01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.713
Which is?

1194
01:37:01.803 --> 01:37:04.849
Inversion.
But not objects or peoples.


1195
01:37:04.939 --> 01:37:06.051
The world around us.

1196
01:37:06.141 --> 01:37:07.552
I don't understand.

1197
01:37:07.642 --> 01:37:10.221
As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,


1198
01:37:10.311 --> 01:37:14.059
the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.


1199
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:17.729
But because the environment
essentially flows in our direction...


1200
01:37:17.819 --> 01:37:18.763
We dominate.

1201
01:37:18.853 --> 01:37:20.465
They're always swimming upstream.

1202
01:37:20.555 --> 01:37:22.000
It's what saved your life.

1203
01:37:22.090 --> 01:37:24.869
Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.


1204
01:37:24.959 --> 01:37:26.437
Pissing in the wind.

1205
01:37:26.527 --> 01:37:28.773
And the algorithm can change
the direction of that wind.


1206
01:37:28.863 --> 01:37:31.566
It can invert the entropy
of the world.


1207
01:37:32.234 --> 01:37:33.678
And if that happens?

1208
01:37:33.768 --> 01:37:34.802
Oh...

1209
01:37:35.369 --> 01:37:36.781
End of play.

1210
01:37:36.871 --> 01:37:38.984
"End of play."
Can you be a little more precise?


1211
01:37:39.074 --> 01:37:42.888
Everyone and everything that's
ever lived, destroyed. Instantly.


1212
01:37:42.978 --> 01:37:44.022
Precise enough?

1213
01:37:44.112 --> 01:37:45.813
Including my son.

1214
01:37:48.749 --> 01:37:52.020
The more you sleep,
the faster you'll heal.


1215
01:38:07.869 --> 01:38:09.104
On a truck.

1216
01:38:11.372 --> 01:38:12.807
Shouldn't be long now.

1217
01:38:13.875 --> 01:38:16.121
I've been thinking.

1218
01:38:16.211 --> 01:38:18.056
We're their ancestors.

1219
01:38:18.146 --> 01:38:20.959
If they destroy us,
won't that destroy them?


1220
01:38:21.049 --> 01:38:23.361
This brings us to the
grandfather paradox.


1221
01:38:23.451 --> 01:38:24.785
The what?

1222
01:38:25.519 --> 01:38:26.899
If you went back in time

1223
01:38:26.989 --> 01:38:28.566
and killed your own grandfather,

1224
01:38:28.656 --> 01:38:30.568
how could you have been born
to commit the act?


1225
01:38:30.658 --> 01:38:31.836
What's the answer?

1226
01:38:31.926 --> 01:38:33.972
There's no answer.
It's a paradox.


1227
01:38:34.062 --> 01:38:35.174
But in the future,

1228
01:38:35.264 --> 01:38:36.841
those in power clearly believe
that you can


1229
01:38:36.931 --> 01:38:38.409
kick grandpa down the stairs,

1230
01:38:38.499 --> 01:38:40.245
gouge his eyes out,

1231
01:38:40.335 --> 01:38:41.512
slit his throat,

1232
01:38:41.602 --> 01:38:43.282
without consequence.

1233
01:38:43.372 --> 01:38:45.117
Could they be right?

1234
01:38:45.207 --> 01:38:46.818
Doesn't matter.

1235
01:38:46.908 --> 01:38:48.553
They believe it.

1236
01:38:48.643 --> 01:38:50.845
So they're willing to destroy us.

1237
01:38:52.513 --> 01:38:54.226
Can I go back to sleep now?

1238
01:38:54.316 --> 01:38:55.760
No. I thought of something else.

1239
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:56.727
Great.

1240
01:38:56.817 --> 01:38:58.763
This reversing the flow of time.

1241
01:38:58.853 --> 01:39:01.632
Doesn't us being here now
mean it never happens?


1242
01:39:01.722 --> 01:39:03.969
That we stop them?

1243
01:39:04.059 --> 01:39:06.395
Optimistically, 
I'd say that's right.

1244
01:39:06.494 --> 01:39:08.040
Pessimistically?

1245
01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:10.541
In a parallel worlds theory,
we can't know the relationship


1246
01:39:10.631 --> 01:39:13.678
between consciousness
and multiple realities.


1247
01:39:13.768 --> 01:39:15.214
Does your head hurt yet?

1248
01:39:15.304 --> 01:39:16.637
Yes.

1249
01:39:20.375 --> 01:39:21.909
Try to sleep.

1250
01:39:36.757 --> 01:39:38.126
Shit.

1251
01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.629
They didn't take us inside.

1252
01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:44.532
What do we do?

1253
01:39:47.635 --> 01:39:48.914
We use the breach.

1254
01:39:49.004 --> 01:39:51.073
The chaos right after impact.
Get ready.


1255
01:39:54.042 --> 01:39:55.643
She healed enough?

1256
01:39:56.378 --> 01:39:58.190
I don't know.

1257
01:39:58.280 --> 01:39:59.624
I've never done this before.

1258
01:39:59.714 --> 01:40:02.361
The fire crew's there.

1259
01:40:02.451 --> 01:40:03.861
You take Kat through the breach,

1260
01:40:03.951 --> 01:40:05.730
I take care of Sator's men
and secure the vault.


1261
01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:07.422
Then you bring her in.

1262
01:40:09.057 --> 01:40:10.102
How's your arm?

1263
01:40:10.192 --> 01:40:11.826
Not good.

1264
01:40:16.264 --> 01:40:18.133
We move as soon as
we hear the engines.


1265
01:40:22.636 --> 01:40:23.781
Hold on, hold on.
What?


1266
01:40:23.871 --> 01:40:25.716
You're bleeding.

1267
01:40:25.806 --> 01:40:27.175
All right,
let me take a look at it.


1268
01:40:33.781 --> 01:40:34.983
Ready?

1269
01:41:07.782 --> 01:41:09.317
Wait here. I'm going in.

1270
01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.146
Come on!

1271
01:43:08.236 --> 01:43:09.271
Go, go, go!

1272
01:43:39.534 --> 01:43:40.402
Go!

1273
01:45:22.637 --> 01:45:24.482
You knew it was me
coming out of that vault.


1274
01:45:24.572 --> 01:45:25.816
Why didn't you say?

1275
01:45:25.906 --> 01:45:27.452
That's a lot of explaining

1276
01:45:27.542 --> 01:45:28.920
when someone's about to put
a bullet in their own brain.


1277
01:45:29.010 --> 01:45:30.255
But afterwards?

1278
01:45:30.345 --> 01:45:33.592
Thing's the same,
I knew you'd be okay.


1279
01:45:33.682 --> 01:45:35.193
What's happened's happened.

1280
01:45:35.283 --> 01:45:38.520
If I told you and you acted
differently, who knows?


1281
01:45:40.121 --> 01:45:42.667
The policy is to suppress.

1282
01:45:42.757 --> 01:45:44.569
Whose policy?

1283
01:45:44.659 --> 01:45:45.994
Ours, My Friend.

1284
01:45:49.331 --> 01:45:52.434
We're the people saving the
world from what might've been.


1285
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:03.378
Kat?

1286
01:46:04.346 --> 01:46:06.258
I'm here.

1287
01:46:06.348 --> 01:46:07.959
It'll be quite a scar.

1288
01:46:08.049 --> 01:46:09.417
You'll be okay.

1289
01:46:11.786 --> 01:46:13.031
Did it.

1290
01:46:13.121 --> 01:46:15.000
You did what?

1291
01:46:15.090 --> 01:46:16.991
Andrei has the algorithm.

1292
01:46:17.925 --> 01:46:19.927
You don't know where he is.

1293
01:46:21.862 --> 01:46:23.231
Or when.

1294
01:46:24.332 --> 01:46:26.611
Get Priya here to Oslo.
Why?


1295
01:46:26.701 --> 01:46:29.681
If I don't do something, in two
days, she tells me about the 241.


1296
01:46:29.771 --> 01:46:31.349
Nothing can change that.

1297
01:46:31.439 --> 01:46:32.440
We'll see.

1298
01:46:33.074 --> 01:46:34.542
Just get her here.

1299
01:46:37.045 --> 01:46:38.179
Hello, Priya.

1300
01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:40.525
What's going on?

1301
01:46:40.615 --> 01:46:42.127
Where's Neil?

1302
01:46:42.217 --> 01:46:45.730
Nursing Katherine Barton,
who almost died because of you.


1303
01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:46.797
What did I do?

1304
01:46:46.887 --> 01:46:48.400
It's what you're going to do.

1305
01:46:48.490 --> 01:46:50.635
In two days, you're gonna have
me dangle plutonium-241


1306
01:46:50.725 --> 01:46:53.171
in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.


1307
01:46:53.261 --> 01:46:54.973
Now, I wanna know why.

1308
01:46:55.063 --> 01:46:57.175
You let Sator get hold of 241?

1309
01:46:57.265 --> 01:46:59.267
No, I let him get ahold
of the algorithm.


1310
01:47:00.769 --> 01:47:03.081
So, tell me about it, Priya.

1311
01:47:03.171 --> 01:47:05.583
It's... It's unique.

1312
01:47:05.673 --> 01:47:07.519
The scientist who built it
took her own life


1313
01:47:07.609 --> 01:47:09.220
so she couldn't be forced
to make another.


1314
01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:10.488
A scientist in the future?

1315
01:47:10.578 --> 01:47:11.556
Generations from now.

1316
01:47:11.646 --> 01:47:13.391
Why does she have to kill herself?

1317
01:47:13.481 --> 01:47:16.394
You're familiar with the
Manhattan Project?


1318
01:47:16.484 --> 01:47:18.563
As they approached
the first atomic test,


1319
01:47:18.653 --> 01:47:20.131
Oppenheimer became concerned

1320
01:47:20.221 --> 01:47:22.934
that the detonation might
produce a chain reaction,


1321
01:47:23.024 --> 01:47:24.235
engulfing the world.

1322
01:47:24.325 --> 01:47:25.836
They went ahead anyway
and got lucky.


1323
01:47:25.926 --> 01:47:30.508
Think of our scientist as
her generation's Oppenheimer.


1324
01:47:30.598 --> 01:47:33.111
She devises a method
for inverting the world,


1325
01:47:33.201 --> 01:47:35.914
but becomes convinced
that by destroying us,


1326
01:47:36.004 --> 01:47:37.615
they're destroying themselves.

1327
01:47:37.705 --> 01:47:39.551
The grandfather paradox.

1328
01:47:39.641 --> 01:47:41.519
But, unlike Oppenheimer,

1329
01:47:41.609 --> 01:47:42.721
she rebels,

1330
01:47:42.811 --> 01:47:45.023
splitting the algorithm
into nine sections


1331
01:47:45.113 --> 01:47:47.649
and hiding them the best place
she can think of.


1332
01:47:48.316 --> 01:47:49.361
The past.

1333
01:47:49.451 --> 01:47:50.328
Here, now.

1334
01:47:50.418 --> 01:47:52.831
There are nine nuclear powers.

1335
01:47:52.921 --> 01:47:54.865
Nine bombs.

1336
01:47:54.955 --> 01:47:57.902
Nine sets of the most closely guarded
materials in the history of the world.


1337
01:47:57.992 --> 01:48:00.004
The best hiding place possible.

1338
01:48:00.094 --> 01:48:02.873
Nuclear containment facilities.

1339
01:48:02.963 --> 01:48:04.342
Sator's lifelong mission,

1340
01:48:04.432 --> 01:48:07.045
financed and guided
by the future, has been to


1341
01:48:07.135 --> 01:48:09.547
find and reassemble the algorithm.

1342
01:48:09.637 --> 01:48:10.849
Why do they choose him?

1343
01:48:10.939 --> 01:48:12.851
Because he was at the right
place at the right time.


1344
01:48:12.941 --> 01:48:14.919
The collapse of the Soviet Union.

1345
01:48:15.009 --> 01:48:18.323
The most insecure moment in the
history of nuclear weapons.


1346
01:48:18.413 --> 01:48:20.792
How many sections does he have?

1347
01:48:20.882 --> 01:48:22.594
After the 241, all nine.

1348
01:48:22.684 --> 01:48:24.462
Jesus Christ.

1349
01:48:24.552 --> 01:48:27.722
And that's why you're going to
do things differently this time.


1350
01:48:28.690 --> 01:48:30.068
To change things?

1351
01:48:30.158 --> 01:48:31.403
So Katherine won't get hurt?

1352
01:48:31.493 --> 01:48:33.995
So Sator won't get the algorithm.

1353
01:48:35.864 --> 01:48:38.209
If that universe can exist...

1354
01:48:38.299 --> 01:48:39.544
We don't live in it.

1355
01:48:39.634 --> 01:48:41.546
Well, let's try.

1356
01:48:41.636 --> 01:48:43.448
You're going to warn me.

1357
01:48:43.538 --> 01:48:45.116
No, I'm not.

1358
01:48:45.206 --> 01:48:46.751
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1359
01:48:46.841 --> 01:48:48.052
Come on.

1360
01:48:48.142 --> 01:48:50.255
If you had known
what the algorithm was,


1361
01:48:50.345 --> 01:48:52.647
would you have let it fall
into Sator's hands?


1362
01:48:53.781 --> 01:48:55.727
You want Sator to get
the last section.


1363
01:48:55.817 --> 01:48:58.463
That is the only way he'll
bring together the other eight.


1364
01:48:58.553 --> 01:49:00.765
I was supposed to steal it...

1365
01:49:00.855 --> 01:49:01.966
Then lose it?

1366
01:49:02.056 --> 01:49:03.903
Mission accomplished.

1367
01:49:03.993 --> 01:49:05.527
You used me.

1368
01:49:06.361 --> 01:49:08.506
As you used Katherine.

1369
01:49:08.596 --> 01:49:10.832
Standard operating procedure.

1370
01:49:12.001 --> 01:49:13.401
You've done your part.

1371
01:49:13.968 --> 01:49:15.213
My part?

1372
01:49:15.303 --> 01:49:17.849
I'm the protagonist of this operation.

1373
01:49:17.939 --> 01:49:19.083
You...

1374
01:49:19.173 --> 01:49:20.952
Are a protagonist.

1375
01:49:21.042 --> 01:49:24.013
Did you think you were the only
one capable of saving the world?


1376
01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:30.051
No.

1377
01:49:31.152 --> 01:49:32.730
But I am.

1378
01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.098
Because I haven't told you

1379
01:49:34.188 --> 01:49:35.967
where he's assembling the
algorithm or when.


1380
01:49:36.057 --> 01:49:37.168
You're about to.

1381
01:49:37.258 --> 01:49:38.837
No, I'm not.

1382
01:49:38.927 --> 01:49:40.194
So, deal us in.

1383
01:49:41.195 --> 01:49:42.540
"Us"?

1384
01:49:42.630 --> 01:49:44.175
Why would you want to
involve her again?


1385
01:49:44.265 --> 01:49:45.743
Because she can get close to him.

1386
01:49:45.833 --> 01:49:47.111
Does he still trust her?

1387
01:49:47.201 --> 01:49:48.580
He thinks she's dead.

1388
01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:49.949
But he used to.

1389
01:49:50.039 --> 01:49:52.217
You have started looking at
the world in a new way.


1390
01:49:52.307 --> 01:49:53.651
And now, it's your turn.

1391
01:49:53.741 --> 01:49:55.386
Assuming she makes it out alive,

1392
01:49:55.476 --> 01:49:57.689
whether or not you feel
she knows too much.


1393
01:49:57.779 --> 01:49:58.857
I can't.

1394
01:49:58.947 --> 01:50:00.258
If you don't have the authority,

1395
01:50:00.348 --> 01:50:02.694
then talk to whoever's
in charge of loose ends.


1396
01:50:02.784 --> 01:50:04.429
I need your word

1397
01:50:04.519 --> 01:50:07.465
that she and her son
will be safe, Priya.


1398
01:50:07.555 --> 01:50:09.524
What good is someone's word
in our line of business?


1399
01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:16.497
They'll be safe.

1400
01:50:18.399 --> 01:50:20.512
There's a rally point
offshore at Trondheim.


1401
01:50:20.602 --> 01:50:22.213
Get yourselves up there.

1402
01:50:22.303 --> 01:50:24.182
Ives has a team ready to invert.

1403
01:50:24.272 --> 01:50:25.717
You have a turnstile?

1404
01:50:25.807 --> 01:50:28.319
The exact technology that
we're trying to suppress.


1405
01:50:28.409 --> 01:50:31.089
Fighting fire with fire's
a treacherous business.


1406
01:50:31.179 --> 01:50:33.258
But there are some people,
in the future,


1407
01:50:33.348 --> 01:50:36.851
who want to continue the
algorithm's journey into the past.


1408
01:50:37.919 --> 01:50:39.430
You see...

1409
01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:42.400
Tenet wasn't founded in the past.

1410
01:50:42.490 --> 01:50:45.693
It will be founded in the future.

1411
01:51:12.021 --> 01:51:13.933
Can't get over the birds.

1412
01:51:14.023 --> 01:51:15.823
How're you feeling?

1413
01:51:21.096 --> 01:51:22.730
Tell me you're gonna kill him.

1414
01:51:23.531 --> 01:51:24.442
I can't.

1415
01:51:24.532 --> 01:51:25.677
Why not?

1416
01:51:25.767 --> 01:51:27.445
Bet you've probably
killed a lot of people.


1417
01:51:27.535 --> 01:51:29.614
Not with a dead man's switch.

1418
01:51:29.704 --> 01:51:31.951
The fitness tracker he wears.

1419
01:51:32.041 --> 01:51:33.217
He's obsessive about his health.

1420
01:51:33.307 --> 01:51:34.485
It'll be linked to a switch,

1421
01:51:34.575 --> 01:51:36.654
probably a simple e-mail burst

1422
01:51:36.744 --> 01:51:38.489
that reveals the location
of the dead drop,


1423
01:51:38.579 --> 01:51:40.491
set to fire if his heart stops.

1424
01:51:40.581 --> 01:51:42.962
His death activates the algorithm.

1425
01:51:43.052 --> 01:51:44.829
He dies, the world ends.

1426
01:51:44.919 --> 01:51:46.587
No one dares kill him.

1427
01:51:48.690 --> 01:51:50.825
No, you've missed the point.

1428
01:51:53.095 --> 01:51:54.629
He's intending to end his life.

1429
01:51:56.999 --> 01:51:57.865
Why?

1430
01:51:59.701 --> 01:52:01.235
He's dying.

1431
01:52:02.071 --> 01:52:04.305
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

1432
01:52:05.606 --> 01:52:07.585
And he's taking the world
with him.


1433
01:52:07.675 --> 01:52:09.888
If he can't have her,
no one can.


1434
01:52:09.978 --> 01:52:14.158
He gets to choose the time and
place for the end of the world.


1435
01:52:14.248 --> 01:52:16.784
What moment?
What does he choose?


1436
01:52:18.619 --> 01:52:21.589
You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.


1437
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:23.201
Vietnam.

1438
01:52:23.291 --> 01:52:25.236
You said he vanished. What day?

1439
01:52:25.326 --> 01:52:27.672
I went ashore with Max and he flew
off, but I don't know what day it was.


1440
01:52:27.762 --> 01:52:30.075
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.

1441
01:52:30.165 --> 01:52:31.442
He was in Ukraine.

1442
01:52:31.532 --> 01:52:33.177
At the Kiev opera siege.

1443
01:52:33.267 --> 01:52:36.714
How do you know about that?

1444
01:52:36.804 --> 01:52:39.018
The point is, he wasn't on his
yacht, so that's his window.


1445
01:52:39.108 --> 01:52:41.686
To go back to that golden
moment and have it be his last.


1446
01:52:41.776 --> 01:52:43.388
Everyone's last.

1447
01:52:43.478 --> 01:52:45.223
We have to lift the algorithm
from the dead drop


1448
01:52:45.313 --> 01:52:46.591
without Sator knowing.

1449
01:52:46.681 --> 01:52:48.894
If he believes it's there,
he kills himself.


1450
01:52:48.984 --> 01:52:50.395
And not the rest of us.

1451
01:52:50.485 --> 01:52:51.596
Where's the dead drop?

1452
01:52:51.686 --> 01:52:53.364
Knowledge divided, my friend.

1453
01:52:53.454 --> 01:52:54.499
You're not gonna tell me?

1454
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:55.968
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1455
01:52:56.058 --> 01:52:57.970
But I need you back
on that yacht, Kat.


1456
01:52:58.060 --> 01:52:59.871
Why?

1457
01:52:59.961 --> 01:53:02.306
You have to stop him killing
himself until we know the algorithm


1458
01:53:02.396 --> 01:53:04.308
is out of the dead drop.

1459
01:53:04.398 --> 01:53:06.444
But if I'm caught there,
my son sees.


1460
01:53:06.534 --> 01:53:08.246
I don't want those moments
to be full of anguish


1461
01:53:08.336 --> 01:53:10.538
if they're gonna be his last.

1462
01:53:11.206 --> 01:53:12.473
They're not.

1463
01:53:37.398 --> 01:53:38.609
It's time.

1464
01:53:38.699 --> 01:53:40.045
We're working our way
back to the 14th,


1465
01:53:40.135 --> 01:53:41.779
but without knowing
where the dead drop is,


1466
01:53:41.869 --> 01:53:44.438
there's only so much
I can do to prepare.


1467
01:53:45.506 --> 01:53:48.586
You know what a hypocenter is?

1468
01:53:48.676 --> 01:53:50.989
It's ground zero for
an underground nuclear test.


1469
01:53:51.079 --> 01:53:56.161
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a
detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.


1470
01:53:56.251 --> 01:53:58.563
The dead drop is at the bottom
of the hypocenter.


1471
01:53:58.653 --> 01:54:01.632
That explosion seals up the algorithm.

1472
01:54:01.722 --> 01:54:03.401
Well, then we better
pull it out of that hole


1473
01:54:03.491 --> 01:54:05.693
before the bomb goes off, eh?

1474
01:54:07.829 --> 01:54:09.574
Line it up.

1475
01:54:09.664 --> 01:54:10.865
Move forward.

1476
01:54:12.967 --> 01:54:13.968
Next.

1477
01:54:18.207 --> 01:54:19.407
Line it up.

1478
01:54:21.043 --> 01:54:22.376
Where's Neil?

1479
01:54:25.314 --> 01:54:26.524
He must've gone through already.

1480
01:54:26.614 --> 01:54:28.359
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1481
01:54:28.449 --> 01:54:30.062
This is goodbye, isn't it?

1482
01:54:30.152 --> 01:54:31.763
I'd like to say...

1483
01:54:31.853 --> 01:54:33.664
That you don't have to do
this, Kat...


1484
01:54:33.754 --> 01:54:36.834
Worst thing Andrei ever did to
me was that offer he made me.


1485
01:54:36.924 --> 01:54:40.128
Let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.


1486
01:54:41.395 --> 01:54:43.374
I shouted and...

1487
01:54:43.464 --> 01:54:45.543
Swore.

1488
01:54:45.633 --> 01:54:48.036
But he'd seen it on my face,
just for an instant.


1489
01:54:51.372 --> 01:54:53.551
I considered it.

1490
01:54:53.641 --> 01:54:55.853
I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,


1491
01:54:55.943 --> 01:54:58.013
or because he knows that
about me.


1492
01:54:58.412 --> 01:54:59.614
Oh.

1493
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:02.794
A chance to help save my child.

1494
01:55:02.884 --> 01:55:05.063
You can't know
what that means to a mother.


1495
01:55:05.153 --> 01:55:06.430
No.

1496
01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.366
You've killed people
you've hated before.


1497
01:55:08.456 --> 01:55:09.867
It's not usually personal.

1498
01:55:09.957 --> 01:55:11.937
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.


1499
01:55:12.027 --> 01:55:13.805
It always counts, Kat.

1500
01:55:13.895 --> 01:55:17.341
You're not there to kill him,
you're the backstop.


1501
01:55:17.431 --> 01:55:20.279
If we don't lift that algorithm
and he kills himself,


1502
01:55:20.369 --> 01:55:22.070
he takes us all with him.

1503
01:55:24.639 --> 01:55:26.908
You just keep up your end, okay?

1504
01:55:30.845 --> 01:55:32.356
Today's the 14th.

1505
01:55:32.446 --> 01:55:34.026
Offshore of Siberia.

1506
01:55:34.116 --> 01:55:35.426
Time for us to go.

1507
01:55:35.516 --> 01:55:36.794
You keep going back another day,

1508
01:55:36.884 --> 01:55:38.696
give you some time
to get back into Vietnam.


1509
01:55:38.786 --> 01:55:39.864
And who gets me on the yacht?

1510
01:55:39.954 --> 01:55:41.732
I've got somebody good lined up.

1511
01:55:41.822 --> 01:55:44.769
When it's over, when you're
raising your boy, carry this.


1512
01:55:44.859 --> 01:55:47.172
There may be a time and place
you feel threatened.


1513
01:55:47.262 --> 01:55:50.474
Hit "Talk," state your location,
hang up.


1514
01:55:50.564 --> 01:55:52.510
Who gets the message?

1515
01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:54.502
Posterity.

1516
01:56:33.641 --> 01:56:35.220
Stalsk-12.

1517
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:38.389
Hidden from the world is a city
where anything can happen.


1518
01:56:38.479 --> 01:56:42.860
And today, ladies and gents, for
ten minutes, it most assuredly does.


1519
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:46.664
You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.


1520
01:56:46.754 --> 01:56:48.267
We're Red Team, moving forward.

1521
01:56:48.357 --> 01:56:50.768
In order to distinguish the
teams, you'll wear these.


1522
01:56:50.858 --> 01:56:52.304
Our friends over there,

1523
01:56:52.394 --> 01:56:54.672
Blue Team, led by Commander
Wheeler, are inverted.


1524
01:56:54.762 --> 01:56:56.874
Why don't they let us see them?

1525
01:56:56.964 --> 01:56:58.343
Maybe we won't like what happened.

1526
01:56:58.433 --> 01:57:01.436
One hour from now,
they had this briefing.


1527
01:57:03.205 --> 01:57:06.651
Then, were dropped on the
ridge above the Hypocenter,


1528
01:57:06.741 --> 01:57:08.954
as close in time to the
detonation as possible.


1529
01:57:09.044 --> 01:57:12.958
Their objectives were
clearance and clarification.


1530
01:57:13.048 --> 01:57:17.052
Now, this briefing has the
benefit of their experience.


1531
01:57:33.801 --> 01:57:35.713
Both teams have countdown watches.

1532
01:57:35.803 --> 01:57:38.350
Ours counts down from ten,
from landing


1533
01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:40.252
to zero to the explosion.

1534
01:57:40.342 --> 01:57:41.987
Blue Team is reversed.
Everybody, look to your left.


1535
01:57:42.077 --> 01:57:46.114
If you are not at the LZ
at zero, you are not leaving.


1536
01:57:47.182 --> 01:57:48.427
Do you understand?

1537
01:57:48.517 --> 01:57:52.097
We drop in, clear LZs
for Blue Team evacuation.


1538
01:57:52.187 --> 01:57:53.899
We make our way into the city proper.

1539
01:57:53.989 --> 01:57:56.600
These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned


1540
01:57:56.690 --> 01:57:58.303
there is a turnstile.

1541
01:57:58.393 --> 01:58:00.372
Expect a bitemporal response.

1542
01:58:00.462 --> 01:58:01.839
They'll have inverse ordnance?

1543
01:58:01.929 --> 01:58:04.176
Inverse, conventional,

1544
01:58:04.266 --> 01:58:07.545
forward antagonists, inverted
antagonists, they have it all.


1545
01:58:07.635 --> 01:58:09.114
On the other side of the city,

1546
01:58:09.204 --> 01:58:11.450
the ground rises to the ridge
above the Hypocenter.


1547
01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:14.953
A splinter unit will take this
tunnel from the city


1548
01:58:15.043 --> 01:58:16.955
to the floor of the Hypocenter.

1549
01:58:17.045 --> 01:58:19.724
Blue Team located an entrance here.

1550
01:58:19.814 --> 01:58:21.893
The bomb is in this rock,

1551
01:58:21.983 --> 01:58:25.097
high above, to trigger a collapse,

1552
01:58:25.187 --> 01:58:26.064
sealing the cavern.

1553
01:58:26.154 --> 01:58:27.765
How do we defuse the bomb up there?

1554
01:58:27.855 --> 01:58:30.302
We don't.
The explosion takes place as planned.


1555
01:58:30.392 --> 01:58:34.306
Now, our job is to fail
to defuse that bomb


1556
01:58:34.396 --> 01:58:38.110
while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.


1557
01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:38.977
Which is?

1558
01:58:39.067 --> 01:58:41.246
Need to know, and you don't.

1559
01:58:41.336 --> 01:58:43.081
Any other stupid questions?

1560
01:58:43.171 --> 01:58:45.806
Good. Well, let's go.
Let's get ready.


1561
01:58:48.543 --> 01:58:49.921
I wanted to be on the first wave.

1562
01:58:50.011 --> 01:58:51.390
There is no first wave.

1563
01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:54.259
Red Team and Blue Team
operate simultaneously.


1564
01:58:54.349 --> 01:58:56.061
Look,

1565
01:58:56.151 --> 01:58:58.263
don't get on the chopper if you
can't stop thinking in linear terms.


1566
01:58:58.353 --> 01:59:01.665
Now, you wanna be on the team that
lifts the contents of the capsule?


1567
01:59:01.755 --> 01:59:03.768
Absolutely.

1568
01:59:03.858 --> 01:59:05.904
Yeah, that's us.

1569
01:59:05.994 --> 01:59:07.439
We're Splinter Unit.

1570
01:59:07.529 --> 01:59:09.274
Just us?

1571
01:59:09.364 --> 01:59:12.978
No one who knows the contents of
that capsule can leave the field.


1572
01:59:13.068 --> 01:59:15.836
I thought we'd manage ourselves.

1573
01:59:25.347 --> 01:59:27.459
It's 40 feet from the
private deck to the water.


1574
01:59:27.549 --> 01:59:29.094
Can you jump it?

1575
01:59:29.184 --> 01:59:30.429
I can dive it.

1576
01:59:30.519 --> 01:59:33.221
Until you see my signal,
you don't let him die.


1577
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:10.492
Thirty seconds!

1578
02:00:51.566 --> 02:00:52.766
Go! Go! Go!

1579
02:01:04.246 --> 02:01:06.324
We're coming in on a shockwave.

1580
02:01:06.414 --> 02:01:07.748
Hang on, People.

1581
02:01:16.691 --> 02:01:18.126
On your feet!

1582
02:01:31.706 --> 02:01:33.208
There!

1583
02:01:46.187 --> 02:01:47.865
Ma'am.
We thought you'd gone ashore.


1584
02:01:47.955 --> 02:01:49.568
Well, I snuck back
to surprise Andrei.


1585
02:01:49.658 --> 02:01:50.592
Oh, the boss left.

1586
02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:54.406
Well, have Mr. 
Sator find me here.

1587
02:01:54.496 --> 02:01:55.806
And don't tell the others.

1588
02:01:55.896 --> 02:01:57.265
I'll get the mess.

1589
02:03:04.766 --> 02:03:05.843
Mines!

1590
02:03:05.933 --> 02:03:07.102
Mines!

1591
02:03:21.182 --> 02:03:22.517
They told me you'd gone ashore.

1592
02:03:24.885 --> 02:03:26.031
They told me you'd flown off.

1593
02:03:26.121 --> 02:03:28.266
I came back to see you and Max.

1594
02:03:28.356 --> 02:03:31.536
Max is on shore with Anna.

1595
02:03:31.626 --> 02:03:33.338
We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.


1596
02:03:33.428 --> 02:03:36.408
I was joking.
It was a stupid joke.


1597
02:03:36.498 --> 02:03:38.276
You think I'm a terrible mother.

1598
02:03:38.366 --> 02:03:41.935
We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.


1599
02:03:49.477 --> 02:03:52.147
I want things to be better, Andrei.

1600
02:04:07.662 --> 02:04:08.997
Take cover!

1601
02:04:13.101 --> 02:04:14.979
Get me a goddamn AT4!

1602
02:04:15.069 --> 02:04:16.847
Take him out, now!

1603
02:04:16.937 --> 02:04:18.316
Provide some cover!

1604
02:04:18.406 --> 02:04:20.518
Move, move, move! Let's go!

1605
02:04:20.608 --> 02:04:22.043
Move, move, move!

1606
02:05:32.146 --> 02:05:33.214
Wheeler!

1607
02:05:34.782 --> 02:05:35.827
Get outta there!

1608
02:05:35.917 --> 02:05:37.252
Come on!

1609
02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:43.658
Ives!

1610
02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:47.562
Splinter Unit. Here.

1611
02:05:49.197 --> 02:05:51.176
You know, it's going to be
a beautiful sunset.


1612
02:05:51.266 --> 02:05:56.014
I'll get Max brought back.
We should share the moment with him.


1613
02:05:56.104 --> 02:05:58.983
I'll make you a drink.

1614
02:05:59.073 --> 02:06:01.276
Bring my son back to the boat.

1615
02:06:07.482 --> 02:06:08.726
We're runnin' out of time,
let's go!


1616
02:06:08.816 --> 02:06:11.219
If they see us, it's all for nothing.

1617
02:06:14.856 --> 02:06:16.000
We need a distraction.

1618
02:06:16.090 --> 02:06:17.725
Don't worry about that.

1619
02:06:21.262 --> 02:06:22.797
On my mark!

1620
02:06:25.667 --> 02:06:28.112
RPG, hit the base!

1621
02:06:28.202 --> 02:06:29.404
That building on my mark!

1622
02:06:31.539 --> 02:06:33.218
Three! Two!

1623
02:06:33.308 --> 02:06:35.310
One! Fire!

1624
02:06:36.210 --> 02:06:37.545
Fire!

1625
02:06:52.327 --> 02:06:53.795
Move! Move!

1626
02:07:09.377 --> 02:07:11.579
We're committed now. Come on.

1627
02:07:17.819 --> 02:07:19.330
What's that?

1628
02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:22.190
I borrowed it from the CIA.

1629
02:07:23.257 --> 02:07:24.335
What is it?

1630
02:07:24.425 --> 02:07:26.871
The way the world ends.

1631
02:07:26.961 --> 02:07:29.774
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

1632
02:07:29.864 --> 02:07:31.476
I don't understand.

1633
02:07:31.566 --> 02:07:33.701
When I take this, it's all over.

1634
02:07:34.435 --> 02:07:36.537
Then don't take it yet.

1635
02:07:39.574 --> 02:07:41.275
Why not?

1636
02:07:42.543 --> 02:07:44.957
Because we have the sunset coming.

1637
02:07:45.047 --> 02:07:47.458
And a little vodka left.

1638
02:07:47.548 --> 02:07:49.561
And Max will be here soon.

1639
02:07:49.651 --> 02:07:53.855
They said they thought it was
you, not Anna, ashore with Max.


1640
02:07:56.524 --> 02:08:00.261
So long as you can tell the difference.

1641
02:08:02.196 --> 02:08:04.899
A moment's business, my love.

1642
02:08:17.079 --> 02:08:18.356
Mahir, do you copy?

1643
02:08:18.446 --> 02:08:21.726
Not clear. I repeat, not clear!

1644
02:08:21.816 --> 02:08:22.928
Copy that.

1645
02:08:23.018 --> 02:08:26.320
I repeat, not clear!

1646
02:08:52.747 --> 02:08:53.815
Neil!

1647
02:08:54.649 --> 02:08:55.717
Neil!

1648
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:09.731
Go!

1649
02:09:18.473 --> 02:09:21.409
We don't have anything
big enough to blow this.


1650
02:09:27.448 --> 02:09:29.383
Try him.
See if he's got a grenade.


1651
02:09:33.989 --> 02:09:35.034
Anything?

1652
02:09:35.124 --> 02:09:36.534
Nah, nothing.

1653
02:09:36.624 --> 02:09:38.971
Here, you try having a look.
Can you pick it?


1654
02:09:39.061 --> 02:09:40.271
I hope not.

1655
02:09:40.361 --> 02:09:42.141
I paid a lot for that lock.

1656
02:09:42.231 --> 02:09:45.209
How do you like where my
journey began and yours ends?


1657
02:09:45.299 --> 02:09:46.744
Little radioactive for my taste.

1658
02:09:46.834 --> 02:09:50.848
My fate was always bound up
with radiation.


1659
02:09:50.938 --> 02:09:53.685
We'd work where no one else would.

1660
02:09:53.775 --> 02:09:56.387
I made a bargain with the Devil.

1661
02:09:56.477 --> 02:09:58.189
Money for time.

1662
02:09:58.279 --> 02:10:00.159
We sold our futures.

1663
02:10:00.249 --> 02:10:03.394
And now you're about to make the
same mistake for the entire world.


1664
02:10:03.484 --> 02:10:06.764
It wasn't a mistake.
I made the bargain I could.


1665
02:10:06.854 --> 02:10:08.167
What was yours?

1666
02:10:08.257 --> 02:10:11.070
You fight for a cause
you barely understand...


1667
02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:14.806
With people you trust so little,
you've told them nothing.


1668
02:10:14.896 --> 02:10:17.232
When I die,
the world dies with me.


1669
02:10:17.331 --> 02:10:19.210
And your knowledge dies with you,

1670
02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:22.948
buried in a tomb like an
anonymous Egyptian builder


1671
02:10:23.038 --> 02:10:25.616
sealed in a pyramid
to keep his secret.


1672
02:10:25.706 --> 02:10:28.442
Your faith is blind.
You're a fanatic.


1673
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:51.409
What's more fanatical than
trying to destroy the world?


1674
02:10:51.499 --> 02:10:54.213
I'm not, I'm creating a new one.

1675
02:10:54.303 --> 02:10:58.750
Somewhere, sometime, a man in a
crystalline tower throws a switch


1676
02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:02.553
and Armageddon is both
triggered and avoided.


1677
02:11:02.643 --> 02:11:06.191
Now time itself switches direction.

1678
02:11:06.281 --> 02:11:08.392
The same sunshine we basked in

1679
02:11:08.482 --> 02:11:12.597
will warm the faces of our
descendants generations to come.


1680
02:11:12.687 --> 02:11:14.665
How could they wanna kill us?

1681
02:11:14.755 --> 02:11:17.936
Because their oceans rose
and their rivers ran dry.


1682
02:11:18.026 --> 02:11:22.306
Don't you see? They have no
choice but to turn back.


1683
02:11:22.396 --> 02:11:24.565
We're responsible.

1684
02:11:37.812 --> 02:11:40.615
Knowing this,
do you still want me to stop?


1685
02:11:41.849 --> 02:11:43.162
Yes.

1686
02:11:43.252 --> 02:11:45.530
Each generation looks out for
its own survival.


1687
02:11:45.620 --> 02:11:47.532
That's exactly what they're doing.

1688
02:11:47.622 --> 02:11:49.801
But not you. You're a traitor.

1689
02:11:49.891 --> 02:11:51.402
Bringing death to all,
because you have no life


1690
02:11:51.492 --> 02:11:53.071
of your own left.

1691
02:11:53.161 --> 02:11:54.973
When I'm done, life continues.

1692
02:11:55.063 --> 02:11:56.707
Not your son's.

1693
02:11:56.797 --> 02:12:00.411
My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.


1694
02:12:00.501 --> 02:12:02.536
You think God will forgive me?

1695
02:12:08.210 --> 02:12:09.510
Wait!

1696
02:12:10.312 --> 02:12:11.512
Wait!

1697
02:12:12.347 --> 02:12:13.848
God...

1698
02:12:25.093 --> 02:12:26.727
Cover me!

1699
02:12:34.435 --> 02:12:36.504
Go! Go! Go!

1700
02:12:37.972 --> 02:12:40.651
You don't believe in God,
or a future,


1701
02:12:40.741 --> 02:12:42.820
or anything outside
of your own experience.


1702
02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:45.991
The rest is belief.

1703
02:12:46.081 --> 02:12:48.459
And I don't have it.

1704
02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:50.528
Without it, you're not human.

1705
02:12:50.618 --> 02:12:52.154
You're just a madman.

1706
02:12:52.853 --> 02:12:54.900
Or a god.

1707
02:12:54.990 --> 02:12:55.901
Of sorts.

1708
02:12:55.991 --> 02:12:57.025
Like I said.

1709
02:13:00.228 --> 02:13:02.241
Don't. Jesus.

1710
02:13:02.331 --> 02:13:03.764
Our time is up.

1711
02:13:10.305 --> 02:13:12.717
I'll give your love to my wife.

1712
02:13:12.807 --> 02:13:15.254
You're forgetting.
I haven't met her yet.


1713
02:13:15.344 --> 02:13:16.355
That's right.

1714
02:13:16.445 --> 02:13:17.990
After you meet her, she dies.

1715
02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:20.848
I'll just give her my love instead.

1716
02:13:22.084 --> 02:13:22.985
Don't do...

1717
02:13:24.453 --> 02:13:25.988
Volkov...

1718
02:13:39.201 --> 02:13:41.236
Enough business, My Love.

1719
02:14:08.196 --> 02:14:11.099
You have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you?


1720
02:14:13.068 --> 02:14:15.936
But it sounds terribly important.

1721
02:14:17.838 --> 02:14:19.284
Where are you going?

1722
02:14:19.374 --> 02:14:20.574
Aren't you hot?

1723
02:14:37.359 --> 02:14:38.703
What are you doing now?

1724
02:14:38.793 --> 02:14:40.638
I spilled sunscreen.

1725
02:14:40.728 --> 02:14:42.797
So what?
Slippery!


1726
02:14:45.866 --> 02:14:47.601
Just come here.

1727
02:14:50.604 --> 02:14:52.017
Turn over.

1728
02:14:52.107 --> 02:14:53.607
You'll like it.

1729
02:15:27.842 --> 02:15:30.155
I can't do this.

1730
02:15:30.245 --> 02:15:32.523
I can't let you think you've won.
Don't spoil this moment, Kat.


1731
02:15:32.613 --> 02:15:35.649
I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.


1732
02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:39.663
You're dying alone, Andrei.

1733
02:15:39.753 --> 02:15:40.999
Come on, come on, come on!

1734
02:15:41.089 --> 02:15:43.768
Tunnel's sealed, gate's closed.

1735
02:15:43.858 --> 02:15:45.937
Mahir, do you copy?

1736
02:15:46.027 --> 02:15:46.837
Yeah.

1737
02:15:46.927 --> 02:15:48.896
Hold. I repeat, hold!

1738
02:15:54.169 --> 02:15:55.203
Look in my eyes.

1739
02:15:56.637 --> 02:15:58.206
Which do you see?

1740
02:15:59.307 --> 02:16:02.244
Despair or anger?

1741
02:16:03.512 --> 02:16:05.656
I'm not the woman who could
find love for you


1742
02:16:05.746 --> 02:16:07.915
even though you scarred her
on the inside.


1743
02:16:09.351 --> 02:16:13.421
I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.


1744
02:16:16.591 --> 02:16:17.791
No!

1745
02:16:36.744 --> 02:16:38.823
Shit.

1746
02:16:38.913 --> 02:16:41.026
Ives, she's killed him. Ives,
do you copy? She's killed him.


1747
02:16:41.116 --> 02:16:44.186
She jumped the gun.
She killed him.


1748
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:05.106
Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?


1749
02:17:09.511 --> 02:17:10.844
Ah, screw it.

1750
02:18:21.216 --> 02:18:23.895
Kat!
You jumped the gun!


1751
02:18:23.985 --> 02:18:25.763
I couldn't do it.

1752
02:18:25.853 --> 02:18:27.933
I couldn't let him die
thinking he'd won.


1753
02:18:28.023 --> 02:18:30.801
I knew you'd find a way.

1754
02:18:30.891 --> 02:18:32.803
Wait, you found a way,
we're okay, right?


1755
02:18:32.893 --> 02:18:34.996
Yeah, found a way. Be safe.

1756
02:18:56.785 --> 02:18:58.396
Thought you were inverted.

1757
02:18:58.486 --> 02:19:00.255
Changed gears halfway.

1758
02:19:01.456 --> 02:19:03.268
Looked like you needed help here.

1759
02:19:03.358 --> 02:19:05.859
Here?
We needed help down there.


1760
02:19:06.894 --> 02:19:09.007
How'd you get that lock open?

1761
02:19:09.097 --> 02:19:11.366
Wasn't me.
Didn't your team need you?


1762
02:19:12.267 --> 02:19:14.202
I'll get 'em on the next pass.

1763
02:19:14.835 --> 02:19:16.248
All right, Ives?

1764
02:19:16.338 --> 02:19:18.239
Once I've caught my breath.

1765
02:19:32.220 --> 02:19:34.922
No one who's seen this
leaves the field.


1766
02:19:43.631 --> 02:19:45.233
All right.

1767
02:19:48.636 --> 02:19:50.138
We hide it.

1768
02:19:50.839 --> 02:19:52.951
We end our lives.

1769
02:19:53.041 --> 02:19:55.410
That's the only way to be sure.

1770
02:19:57.011 --> 02:19:59.157
As to when...

1771
02:19:59.247 --> 02:20:01.949
Maybe that's every man's
decision to make for himself.


1772
02:20:02.851 --> 02:20:04.129
You're not gonna kill us?

1773
02:20:04.219 --> 02:20:06.765
If I ever find you, I will.

1774
02:20:06.855 --> 02:20:08.423
But you won't look too hard?

1775
02:20:09.457 --> 02:20:10.592
Yes, I will.

1776
02:20:14.229 --> 02:20:16.441
You're not going back to London
to check on Kat, are you?


1777
02:20:16.531 --> 02:20:17.242
No.

1778
02:20:17.332 --> 02:20:19.167
It's far too dangerous.

1779
02:20:19.834 --> 02:20:21.503
Even from afar?

1780
02:20:22.704 --> 02:20:24.239
Even from afar.

1781
02:20:26.474 --> 02:20:27.609
Ives!

1782
02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:30.011
Wait.

1783
02:20:36.084 --> 02:20:37.685
Are you really going back in?

1784
02:20:40.188 --> 02:20:43.468
I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, Ives?


1785
02:20:43.558 --> 02:20:46.327
Well, I don't know any
locksmiths as good as you.


1786
02:20:47.695 --> 02:20:49.474
See?

1787
02:20:49.564 --> 02:20:51.643
It's me in there, again.

1788
02:20:51.733 --> 02:20:55.069
Weaving another past in the
fabric of this mission.


1789
02:21:03.545 --> 02:21:04.612
Neil, wait!

1790
02:21:08.850 --> 02:21:10.861
Just saved the world.

1791
02:21:10.951 --> 02:21:13.231
Can't leave anything to chance.

1792
02:21:13.321 --> 02:21:16.167
But can we change things
if we do it differently?


1793
02:21:16.257 --> 02:21:18.470
"What's happened's happened."

1794
02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:22.207
Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.


1795
02:21:22.297 --> 02:21:24.132
It's not an excuse to do nothing.

1796
02:21:24.599 --> 02:21:25.510
Fate?

1797
02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:27.145
Call it what you want.

1798
02:21:27.235 --> 02:21:28.436
What do you call it?

1799
02:21:29.337 --> 02:21:30.438
Reality.

1800
02:21:32.974 --> 02:21:34.409
Now let me go.

1801
02:21:39.781 --> 02:21:42.660
Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.


1802
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:44.519
Haven't you guessed by now?

1803
02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:46.998
You did.

1804
02:21:47.088 --> 02:21:49.768
Only not when you thought.

1805
02:21:49.858 --> 02:21:52.170
You have a future in the past.

1806
02:21:52.260 --> 02:21:55.430
Years ago for me.
Years from now for you.


1807
02:21:56.264 --> 02:21:57.999
You've known me for years?

1808
02:21:59.501 --> 02:22:03.348
For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.


1809
02:22:03.438 --> 02:22:05.950
But for me, it's just the beginning.

1810
02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:08.219
We get up to some stuff.

1811
02:22:08.309 --> 02:22:11.489
You're gonna love it.
You'll see.


1812
02:22:11.579 --> 02:22:14.182
This whole operation's
a temporal pincer.


1813
02:22:14.649 --> 02:22:16.050
Whose?

1814
02:22:17.418 --> 02:22:18.963
Yours!

1815
02:22:19.053 --> 02:22:20.532
You're only halfway there.

1816
02:22:20.622 --> 02:22:22.657
I'll see you at the beginning, Friend.

1817
02:22:31.099 --> 02:22:34.479
We're the people saving the
world from what might have been.


1818
02:22:34.569 --> 02:22:36.504
World will never know
what could've happened.


1819
02:22:38.373 --> 02:22:41.409
And even if they did,
they wouldn't care.


1820
02:22:45.246 --> 02:22:48.049
'Cause no one cares about
the bomb that didn't go off.


1821
02:22:48.816 --> 02:22:50.652
Only the one that did.

1822
02:22:53.154 --> 02:22:54.489
Do it before the boy comes out.

1823
02:22:57.026 --> 02:23:00.305
That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.


1824
02:23:00.395 --> 02:23:03.943
And I told you then
what it would be worth.


1825
02:23:04.033 --> 02:23:06.134
Here, today.

1826
02:23:07.235 --> 02:23:10.448
How did you know?

1827
02:23:10.538 --> 02:23:13.919
Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...


1828
02:23:14.009 --> 02:23:15.286
Posterity.

1829
02:23:15.376 --> 02:23:18.958
Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...


1830
02:23:19.048 --> 02:23:22.794
I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.


1831
02:23:22.884 --> 02:23:25.931
I have to tie up the loose ends.
That was never your job.


1832
02:23:26.021 --> 02:23:27.131
Then whose was it?

1833
02:23:27.221 --> 02:23:29.100
Mine.

1834
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:32.637
I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.


1835
02:23:32.727 --> 02:23:34.596
I'm the protagonist.

1836
02:23:36.831 --> 02:23:40.168
Then you'd better tie up
those loose ends.


1837
02:23:42.937 --> 02:23:44.472
Mission accomplished.

1838
02:23:46.341 --> 02:23:48.553
It's the bomb that didn't go off.

1839
02:23:48.643 --> 02:23:51.412
The danger no one knew was real.

1840
02:23:56.451 --> 02:23:59.721
That's the bomb with the real
power to change the world.
