1
00:00:37.168 --> 00:00:39.500
A federal grand jury
in Detroit today


2
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:42.867
charged the 13 top leaders
of the Weathermen


3
00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:44.867
with plotting to bomb
public buildings


4
00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:48.434
in Chicago, Detroit, New York
and Berkeley, California.


5
00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:50.567
The Weathermen are
the militant faction


6
00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:52.767
of the Students for a
Democratic Society.


7
00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:56.242
Only one of the 13
is now in custody.


8
00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:01.000
Never before has this
nation fought a war


9
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:05.614
which so many Americans opposed
for so many different reasons.


10
00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:09.300
Never has this dissent been
as emotional, as intense,


11
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:12.594
as is the dissent against
the war in Vietnam.


12
00:01:17.968 --> 00:01:21.267
The bomb went off at the State
Department and did a lot of damage.


13
00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:23.696
Another was detonated in Oakland.

14
00:01:29.868 --> 00:01:33.634
Three suspects remain at large after
a security guard was shot and killed


15
00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:36.133
during a robbery at
the Bank of Michigan.


16
00:01:36.134 --> 00:01:41.267
The FBI has released the names Mimi
Lurie, Nicholas Sloan and Sharon Solarz,


17
00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:44.767
all members of the radical anti-war
group, the Weather Underground.


18
00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:18.634
Come on, you guys. Let's go.

19
00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:19.734
Bye, Mom.

20
00:02:19.735 --> 00:02:21.500
Don't forget, I have
practice after school.


21
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.066
What are you still practicing for?
You already got into college.


22
00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:25.567
Ha-ha.

23
00:02:25.568 --> 00:02:28.334
Hey, get out of the
front seat. That's mine!


24
00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:30.876
- Where's Dad?
- Hey, Dad, hurry up!


25
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.667
- There you go. Have a good one.
- Thanks.


26
00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:24.034
- Hey.
- Hey.


27
00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.767
- That's $25.74.
- Thank you.


28
00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:27.500
- Want that warmed up?
- No, thanks.


29
00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:28.900
Okay.

30
00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:44.834
Don't move! Hands in the air!

31
00:03:44.835 --> 00:03:47.103
Don't move! Federal agents!

32
00:03:47.134 --> 00:03:48.634
- Against the car.
- Stay still!


33
00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:50.167
Hands behind your back.

34
00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:54.867
Sharon Solarz, you are under arrest
for the murder of Hugh Krosney.


35
00:03:54.868 --> 00:03:56.367
You have the right
to remain silent.


36
00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:58.099
If you give up that right,
anything you say


37
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.334
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.


38
00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:01.867
You have a right to an attorney.

39
00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:04.734
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.


40
00:04:04.735 --> 00:04:07.099
Do you understand these rights?

41
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.434
Sharon Elizabeth Solarz, one of
the longest-standing fugitives


42
00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:13.834
on the FBI's Most Wanted
list, was arrested yesterday


43
00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:17.434
just outside Heatherton, New York,

44
00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:20.200
Bank of Michigan robbery that
claimed the life of a guard.


45
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:22.734
- Good morning, Jess.
- You're late.


46
00:04:22.735 --> 00:04:25.900
Well, if I'm not here,
they can't fire me, right?


47
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:28.939
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks.


48
00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:35.167
Oh, look at that.

49
00:04:35.168 --> 00:04:38.967
A national story right in our own
backyard, and where were we?


50
00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:40.534
Hold on. Crime was
Jachanowitz's. You fired him.


51
00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:41.767
Yeah, and I passed it on to you.

52
00:04:41.768 --> 00:04:44.800
Along with the courts and the Statehouse
and, like, 55 other things. I mean...


53
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:48.603
This is news, Ben. This!

54
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:54.000
We're a goddamn
newspaper, remember?


55
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:56.300
So why don't you go out
and write a nice little story


56
00:04:56.301 --> 00:04:59.099
that informs our readers,
while we still have a few?


57
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.198
I'm sorry, okay?

58
00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:05.762
It's that bad, huh?

59
00:05:06.668 --> 00:05:09.740
Do you still have your friend
in the FBI field office?


60
00:05:11.134 --> 00:05:14.373
In theory, although I'm not sure she
ever wants to speak to me again.


61
00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:17.834
You keep telling me you're
a good reporter, right?


62
00:05:17.835 --> 00:05:19.334
Right.

63
00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:21.239
Prove it.

64
00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:27.434
These were major radicals,
Ben, who know how to hide.


65
00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:31.604
So how does the FBI find
her after 30 years? Hmm?


66
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:41.900
So, let me see, the State wants to seize
private property and transfer it, right?


67
00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:44.967
Yes, I know what
"eminent domain" is.


68
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:49.434
I will if I have to. The Court
of Appeals exists for a reason.


69
00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:51.000
- Izzy!
- Yeah?


70
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:52.867
You better be getting ready.

71
00:05:52.868 --> 00:05:54.434
Uh-huh.

72
00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:58.843
Oh, and you're saying
that satisfies public use?


73
00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:02.334
Really?

74
00:06:02.335 --> 00:06:04.734
- Izzy? You ready?
- Yeah.


75
00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:06.600
Come on! We're going to be late.

76
00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:10.330
- We're not gonna be late.
- You wanna bet?


77
00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:19.034
My client bought it from his dad,

78
00:06:19.035 --> 00:06:20.900
- who bought it from his dad...
- Come on, Dad.


79
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:24.000
...and hopes one day
to sell it to his son.


80
00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:27.840
It's a great family. I'm sure the
jury would enjoy meeting them.


81
00:06:30.668 --> 00:06:32.539
Okay.

82
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.767
- Right on time.
- All set?


83
00:06:36.768 --> 00:06:40.442
- Yup.
- You got your lunch?


84
00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:43.164
No.

85
00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:57.800
- So, what's last? Math?
- No, I've got volleyball.


86
00:06:57.801 --> 00:06:59.734
Oh, okay. I'll pick you
up after practice.


87
00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:02.003
Okay.

88
00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:13.668
Hey, what's your hurry?
Haven't you forgotten something?


89
00:07:15.134 --> 00:07:16.367
Billy.

90
00:07:16.368 --> 00:07:17.967
- Hi, Mr. Cusimano.
- Hi, sweetie.


91
00:07:17.968 --> 00:07:19.467
Aren't your kids a little
old for this school?


92
00:07:19.468 --> 00:07:22.367
Ah, I came to see you.
You seen the news?


93
00:07:22.368 --> 00:07:26.066
- Oh, they're still reporting the news?
- Sharon Solarz.


94
00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:27.634
Go ahead, go ahead.

95
00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:30.400
- You know who she is, right?
- What?


96
00:07:30.401 --> 00:07:33.567
She was busted, man. She was
arrested over in Heatherton.


97
00:07:33.568 --> 00:07:35.734
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because Sharon's an old friend.


98
00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:37.634
Are you in trouble, Billy?
You know, you're still on parole.


99
00:07:37.635 --> 00:07:39.300
I'm clean, man.

100
00:07:39.301 --> 00:07:41.638
Well, what's going on?

101
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:44.600
She called me, wanted
to turn herself in,


102
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:46.066
but the Feds are assholes.
They don't care...


103
00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:47.267
But you can't get
involved in something...


104
00:07:47.268 --> 00:07:49.934
- She's a friend. She needs a lawyer.
- Well, I can't be her lawyer.


105
00:07:49.935 --> 00:07:53.133
They knew exactly where she was going
to be, Jim, all right? Exactly. They knew.


106
00:07:53.134 --> 00:07:55.133
- This is out of my league.
- They knew exactly.


107
00:07:55.134 --> 00:07:57.563
Out of my league.

108
00:07:57.601 --> 00:08:00.500
- I can't let her twist in the wind.
- I can't do it.


109
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.008
I have a kid that
just lost her mom.


110
00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:05.705
It's been a year.

111
00:08:07.368 --> 00:08:09.340
Sorry.

112
00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:13.267
Call Maggie Hart.

113
00:08:13.268 --> 00:08:16.446
Lockwood and Dunlop, Philly.

114
00:08:16.768 --> 00:08:20.174
Okay? She's great. 
Better than me.

115
00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.099
Sorry.

116
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:31.470
Please set it here.

117
00:08:34.268 --> 00:08:36.267
Go ahead.

118
00:08:36.268 --> 00:08:39.467
- So, you moved her this morning?
- Why do you care?


119
00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:42.967
- I thought you were covering politics now.
- Well, I'm multi-talented.


120
00:08:42.968 --> 00:08:45.934
How come she was arrested here if she's
been a Vermont housewife for 30 years?


121
00:08:45.935 --> 00:08:47.000
You'd have to ask her that.

122
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:49.100
You know, it's funny you should mention
it, Di, 'cause, from what I hear,


123
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.867
people give jailhouse
interviews all the time.


124
00:08:51.868 --> 00:08:55.000
Who do you think you are,
The New York Times?


125
00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:57.667
You say "New York Times" like it's

126
00:08:57.668 --> 00:08:59.267
You're just a local beat reporter.

127
00:08:59.268 --> 00:09:02.230
I love it when you do
that with your hair.


128
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:07.534
This is a national news story. I think
you should go home and tweet about it.


129
00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:10.300
- I don't tweet.
- Right. You don't e-mail, either.


130
00:09:10.301 --> 00:09:13.167
Can I just see the case file,
for old times' sake? Please?


131
00:09:13.168 --> 00:09:14.234
You think, 'cause we
hooked up in college,


132
00:09:14.235 --> 00:09:17.434
I'm gonna give you
access to FBI wiretaps?


133
00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:19.434
Wiretaps?

134
00:09:19.435 --> 00:09:21.133
- What wiretaps?
- This is why I don't talk to you.


135
00:09:21.134 --> 00:09:22.767
And we didn't just hook up
in college, okay? We were...


136
00:09:22.768 --> 00:09:24.700
I have to go.

137
00:09:24.701 --> 00:09:26.967
- New sheriff in town?
- You, you...


138
00:09:26.968 --> 00:09:29.200
- How can you tell?
- That's how it usually goes, right?


139
00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:31.467
Big case like this, they usually
bring in someone from out of town,


140
00:09:31.468 --> 00:09:32.967
grab all the glory.

141
00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:35.300
'Course, the local field office should
at least get credit in the local paper.


142
00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:37.367
Why don't I go put in a good word
for you? I'm a very social guy.


143
00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:39.267
Billy Cusimano.

144
00:09:39.268 --> 00:09:42.234
- Organic grocery guy?
- It didn't come from me.


145
00:09:42.235 --> 00:09:45.710
No, just a "well-placed, extremely
attractive government source."


146
00:09:47.268 --> 00:09:49.514
Cusimano.

147
00:09:56.535 --> 00:09:58.834
Hey, Dad. Here?

148
00:09:58.835 --> 00:10:00.740
Yeah.

149
00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:04.841
Hello.

150
00:10:11.801 --> 00:10:13.900
Billy Cusimano?

151
00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:16.967
My name's Ben Shepard,
from the Albany Sun Times.


152
00:10:16.968 --> 00:10:20.099
I wanted to ask you a few questions
about the Sharon Solarz arrest.


153
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.099
You can, but why would
I comment about that?


154
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.767
Well, you know her, don't you?

155
00:10:24.768 --> 00:10:26.979
No, I don't.

156
00:10:28.301 --> 00:10:30.540
A quick search of police records
shows you and Sharon together...


157
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:34.600
- in Mendocino in 1971.
- I've never been to Mendocino.


158
00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:36.300
That's not true, is it?
You were dealing hash there


159
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:38.300
for an outfit called The
Brotherhood of Eternal Love,


160
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:41.000
which is a great name, by the way.

161
00:10:41.301 --> 00:10:44.206
Sharon been in touch recently?

162
00:10:44.268 --> 00:10:47.412
Look, I know she called
you prior to her arrest.


163
00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:48.700
You talked to Jim Grant?

164
00:10:48.701 --> 00:10:50.534
No, I talked to the FBI.
Who's Jim Grant?


165
00:10:50.535 --> 00:10:51.734
Who's the FBI?

166
00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:53.434
Well, they had you on a
wiretap here for a while,


167
00:10:53.435 --> 00:10:56.567
so it seems you're growing something more
than tomatoes and potatoes here, Billy.


168
00:10:56.568 --> 00:10:58.667
Shit. That's why I
pay taxes, right?


169
00:10:58.668 --> 00:11:01.567
So Big Brother can
hack my fucking phone.


170
00:11:01.568 --> 00:11:04.167
- Who's Jim Grant?
- He's a lawyer, man.


171
00:11:04.168 --> 00:11:06.800
- Lawyer? Sharon's?
- Nah.


172
00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:09.967
He wouldn't take the case.
Look, kid, Sharon called me,


173
00:11:09.968 --> 00:11:11.467
- wanted to turn herself in.
- Turn herself in?


174
00:11:11.468 --> 00:11:13.900
No, I'm not saying anything else.

175
00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:16.267
- Everything here is off the record.
- See, it doesn't work that way.


176
00:11:16.268 --> 00:11:18.600
You've got to say "off the record"
before we have the conversation.


177
00:11:18.601 --> 00:11:20.934
- Who says?
- Those are the rules.


178
00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:24.501
There's rules for what
you people do, huh?


179
00:11:46.035 --> 00:11:47.900
So, what did she say?

180
00:11:47.901 --> 00:11:52.468
She said that I did great and
that she was very impressed.


181
00:11:53.768 --> 00:11:54.867
What did I tell you?

182
00:12:01.335 --> 00:12:04.400
- Yeah?
- Hi, uh, is this Mr. Grant?


183
00:12:04.401 --> 00:12:06.942
This is Ben Shepard from
the Albany Sun Times.


184
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.467
Oh, yes?

185
00:12:08.468 --> 00:12:12.067
Just wondered if you'd care to
comment on the Sharon Solarz arrest?


186
00:12:12.068 --> 00:12:13.867
- What?
- The Sharon Solarz arrest.


187
00:12:13.868 --> 00:12:15.667
You declined to take her
case, and I was just...


188
00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:17.500
You know, I'm just sitting
down to dinner right now.


189
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:21.538
- Uh, I gotta call you back, okay?
- Uh, sir, I just...


190
00:12:29.134 --> 00:12:31.534
As the turbulent decade
drew to a close,


191
00:12:31.535 --> 00:12:34.834
Students for a Democratic Society,
the leading student group


192
00:12:34.835 --> 00:12:37.800
opposed to the war in Vietnam,
had its power usurped


193
00:12:37.801 --> 00:12:42.700
by a more militant faction known as
the Weather Underground Organization.


194
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:45.067
Frustrated with years
of non-violent protests


195
00:12:45.068 --> 00:12:48.367
that had failed to end the war,
the so-called Weathermen


196
00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:51.634
decided the best way to stop
America's involvement in Vietnam


197
00:12:51.635 --> 00:12:53.800
was to bring the war home.

198
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:56.434
The Weathermen radicalized
the anti-war movement


199
00:12:56.435 --> 00:12:59.667
and carried out a series of bombings
against government institutions,


200
00:12:59.668 --> 00:13:04.099
including bombing the Pentagon, the
US Capitol and the State Department.


201
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.630
No group has been more successful
in carrying out attacks on US soil.


202
00:13:17.901 --> 00:13:20.634
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.


203
00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:24.145
- You look weird.
- I'm fine, honey.


204
00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:26.367
You're lying.

205
00:13:26.368 --> 00:13:27.967
I'm not lying.

206
00:13:27.968 --> 00:13:31.400
You are lying because
you're smiling.


207
00:13:31.401 --> 00:13:35.400
- I'm not smiling.
- "I'm not smiling."


208
00:13:35.401 --> 00:13:38.133
Well, maybe I'm happy. Here.

209
00:13:38.134 --> 00:13:40.437
Come on, eat.

210
00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:43.443
I'm gonna get ready.

211
00:13:49.134 --> 00:13:51.500
- Hey.
- Hey.


212
00:13:51.501 --> 00:13:55.267
- You Jim Grant, by chance?
- Not by chance.


213
00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:58.400
Would you follow up on those
countersignatures from Roger, please?


214
00:13:58.401 --> 00:13:59.600
Yup.

215
00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:01.667
I'm Ben Shepard, Albany Sun Times.
We spoke on the phone.


216
00:14:01.668 --> 00:14:04.367
- I just figured I'd come by and say...
- I don't really have anything to say.


217
00:14:04.368 --> 00:14:07.167
Oh, and, Susan, would you pull
out the Rochester files from...


218
00:14:07.168 --> 00:14:08.467
You don't know what I'm
going to ask you yet.


219
00:14:08.468 --> 00:14:10.400
...my report for my
deposition... What?


220
00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:13.099
I said, you don't know what
I'm going to ask you yet.


221
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.800
But you're a reporter.

222
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:17.067
Well, I could just put "refused
to answer any questions."


223
00:14:17.068 --> 00:14:20.940
- What?
- I'm just doing a little background, sir.


224
00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:24.037
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:25.067 --> 00:14:26.167
Okay.

226
00:14:26.168 --> 00:14:28.528
Thank you. Thank you.

227
00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:41.500
Uh, no, no. We're off
the record here.


228
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:43.567
- Which part?
- All of it.


229
00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:47.634
Whatever it is we're going to be talking
about here, otherwise you can leave, now.


230
00:14:47.635 --> 00:14:50.632
No, that's fine.
It's not important.


231
00:14:53.235 --> 00:14:57.066
So, did Sharon Solarz contact
you prior to her arrest?


232
00:14:57.067 --> 00:15:00.467
Does it matter, since you
already printed that she did?


233
00:15:00.468 --> 00:15:02.200
Actually, what was printed was
that she may have approached


234
00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.500
a public interest lawyer who
declined to take the case,


235
00:15:04.501 --> 00:15:07.099
but your name was never mentioned.

236
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:16.800
There are 25 lawyers in the area.
Nine do criminal, six do accidents,


237
00:15:16.801 --> 00:15:19.567
five do deeds and four do
closings, and then there's me.


238
00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:22.300
- I wasn't insinuating...
- To hell with accuracy, huh?


239
00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:25.334
Be vague, be accusatory, and
whatever sticks... That how it works?


240
00:15:25.335 --> 00:15:26.500
Nothing I wrote was false.

241
00:15:26.501 --> 00:15:29.771
You made it seem like I was
harboring a known fugitive.


242
00:15:30.235 --> 00:15:32.167
We can issue a correction.

243
00:15:32.168 --> 00:15:37.267
Sharon Solarz did not contact me,
and I have no involvement in her case.


244
00:15:37.268 --> 00:15:39.605
- Really?
- Really.


245
00:15:39.868 --> 00:15:43.066
You know she's now being represented
by a Margaret Hart in Philadelphia?


246
00:15:43.067 --> 00:15:44.400
Right.

247
00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:46.700
Miss Hart was a classmate
of yours in law school.


248
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:49.700
Mmm-hmm. Lawyers know
each other. That's news?


249
00:15:49.701 --> 00:15:52.867
Yeah, but you did refer Miss
Hart as counsel, didn't you?


250
00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:56.167
- Says who?
- Miss Hart herself, this morning.


251
00:15:56.168 --> 00:15:58.700
Maggie Hart's one of the best
defense lawyers in the country.


252
00:15:58.701 --> 00:16:01.400
But why pass this off? I mean, that's
what doesn't make sense to me.


253
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:03.000
Cases like this don't
come around very often.


254
00:16:03.001 --> 00:16:04.343
I'm sure I don't have
to tell you that.


255
00:16:04.344 --> 00:16:07.099
Sharon Solarz deserves a better
defense than I can provide.


256
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.500
- "Deserves"?
- Thank you.


257
00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:10.067
That's an interesting word choice.

258
00:16:10.068 --> 00:16:13.934
You know, it may seem untrue to
you, but we do live in a free country


259
00:16:13.935 --> 00:16:16.667
and people are entitled
to a decent defense.


260
00:16:16.668 --> 00:16:19.234
Now, look, I got work to do.

261
00:16:19.235 --> 00:16:21.567
You've handled First Amendment
cases, labor cases.


262
00:16:21.568 --> 00:16:23.034
You worked hand in
glove with the ACLU.


263
00:16:23.035 --> 00:16:25.334
I mean, this is right in
your wheelhouse, isn't it?


264
00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:27.034
Is this what you came
here to talk about?


265
00:16:27.035 --> 00:16:28.964
I'm not sure yet.

266
00:16:29.601 --> 00:16:31.800
Well, that pretty well sums
up why journalism is dead.


267
00:16:31.801 --> 00:16:32.934
Now, do you mind?

268
00:16:32.935 --> 00:16:36.300
- Why did Billy Cusimano come to you?
- I don't know.


269
00:16:36.301 --> 00:16:37.834
Well, how well do you
know Billy Cusimano?


270
00:16:37.835 --> 00:16:40.034
- I don't, really.
- I mean, you do, really.


271
00:16:40.035 --> 00:16:42.634
You represented him a few years
back on a drug case. You got him off.


272
00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:44.779
I represent a lot of people. Jesus.

273
00:16:45.268 --> 00:16:49.133
Mis... Look, I'm not trying to
offend you, Mr. Grant. I'm...


274
00:16:49.134 --> 00:16:52.066
Oh, I'm not offended. You're pretty
much exactly what I expected.


275
00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:55.212
Susan, I'll call you from the car.

276
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.700
Sir...

277
00:16:57.701 --> 00:17:00.567
Mr. Grant. I'm just trying
to put the pieces together.


278
00:17:00.568 --> 00:17:02.099
Look. Look, look, listen.

279
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.434
I didn't take the case
because I'm a single parent


280
00:17:04.435 --> 00:17:07.167
with a private practice and too
much on my plate, all right?


281
00:17:07.168 --> 00:17:09.200
If I could have
helped, I would have.


282
00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:12.700
Because you're sympathetic to their
cause? You agree with their tactics?


283
00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:14.867
You know, clearly you have
some kind of an agenda here.


284
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.500
- I don't have time for this bullshit.
- I don't actually.


285
00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:18.804
I don't care much for either side.

286
00:17:18.968 --> 00:17:21.715
So, what? That makes
you fair and balanced?


287
00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:25.200
You know, it's a funny thing. Thirty
years ago, a smart guy like you


288
00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:28.967
probably would have been involved
with the movement yourself.


289
00:17:28.968 --> 00:17:32.237
I hope you get what you're
looking for, kid. Take care.


290
00:17:51.134 --> 00:17:54.769
You told me... You did! Forget it!

291
00:17:57.401 --> 00:17:59.704
Oh, thank you.

292
00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:27.934
One sec. Hang on.

293
00:18:27.935 --> 00:18:29.800
Here you go.

294
00:18:29.801 --> 00:18:31.734
- Thank you for doing this.
- No worries, man.


295
00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:34.310
- I got you.
- Thank you.


296
00:18:36.035 --> 00:18:37.939
Yeah.

297
00:18:54.835 --> 00:18:57.600
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

298
00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:00.467
Not a problem. 
We're having fun.

299
00:19:02.435 --> 00:19:03.667
You do your homework?

300
00:19:03.668 --> 00:19:05.267
Of course.

301
00:19:05.268 --> 00:19:08.344
Good. Thank you.

302
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:11.394
I'm the one who did it.

303
00:19:11.835 --> 00:19:14.764
Oh, oh, well, thank you.

304
00:19:22.435 --> 00:19:25.466
She's getting better every day.

305
00:19:25.735 --> 00:19:27.640
Yeah.

306
00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:00.434
Hey.

307
00:21:00.435 --> 00:21:01.934
Sorry, can you walk me
through that research?


308
00:21:01.935 --> 00:21:04.328
- Yeah.
- Thank you.


309
00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:08.667
It's, uh, all basic stuff.

310
00:21:08.668 --> 00:21:12.434
He was born in
Bakersfield, California,


311
00:21:12.435 --> 00:21:15.400
attended Iowa State University,
University of Virginia Law,


312
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:17.500
met his wife while
working at the...


313
00:21:17.501 --> 00:21:18.600
Planet Earth...

314
00:21:18.601 --> 00:21:20.099
Earth First! Foundation.

315
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.267
Came up here,
started his own practice.


316
00:21:23.268 --> 00:21:26.133
This his wife?
What happened to her?


317
00:21:26.134 --> 00:21:29.066
Car accident. 48 years old.

318
00:21:29.067 --> 00:21:31.867
- Wow, that's horrible.
- Yeah.


319
00:21:31.868 --> 00:21:35.334
You meet a younger woman, you have
a kid, she's not supposed to die on you.


320
00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:39.000
She's supposed to meet a car salesman
and move to Vegas, like mine did.


321
00:21:39.001 --> 00:21:41.867
- Anything else?
- Um, house is paid for.


322
00:21:41.868 --> 00:21:43.834
He's obviously a
responsible single parent,


323
00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:46.367
pillar of society, do-gooder,
a lot of pro-bono work.


324
00:21:46.368 --> 00:21:50.571
Right, so basically nothing I
can turn into a story. Great.


325
00:22:25.701 --> 00:22:26.900
Hello, Dan?

326
00:22:26.901 --> 00:22:29.467
I cannot believe you're calling me.

327
00:22:29.468 --> 00:22:31.667
- I know.
- This is a goddamn nightmare.


328
00:22:31.668 --> 00:22:33.034
- Dan...
- I... I...


329
00:22:33.035 --> 00:22:34.534
I don't want anything
to do with this.


330
00:22:34.535 --> 00:22:38.696
Dan, you're my brother.
I need your help.


331
00:22:42.535 --> 00:22:44.334
Go ahead.

332
00:23:08.001 --> 00:23:11.133
Ray, who's your best reporter?

333
00:23:11.134 --> 00:23:13.334
- Mansfield.
- Mansfield?


334
00:23:13.335 --> 00:23:15.398
Bullshit.

335
00:23:16.335 --> 00:23:18.267
- Please, have a seat.
- Look.


336
00:23:18.268 --> 00:23:21.434
So, at first I think Grant's
trying to link up with the others.


337
00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:22.967
- Yeah?
- Help negotiate a deal, bring them in,


338
00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:24.034
like Solarz tried.

339
00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:25.600
Yeah, well, that would
make a good story.


340
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:29.234
It gets so much better. So, I go
and I look at the man's history.


341
00:23:29.235 --> 00:23:31.734
Right? See if he has any known
associations to the Weathermen.


342
00:23:31.735 --> 00:23:32.800
- Mmm-hmm.
- Nothing.


343
00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:33.967
So?

344
00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:38.102
Nothing on the man at all. The
man doesn't exist before 1979.


345
00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:39.992
Look at this.

346
00:23:41.335 --> 00:23:44.844
I had it wrong, Ray. He's dead.

347
00:23:47.235 --> 00:23:51.534
Jim Grant is not trying to represent
Mimi Lurie or Nick Sloan.


348
00:23:51.535 --> 00:23:54.372
Jim Grant is Nick Sloan.

349
00:23:58.668 --> 00:24:00.334
- I'm tired.
- I know, sweetheart,


350
00:24:00.335 --> 00:24:02.400
but we have to get an early start.

351
00:24:02.401 --> 00:24:03.867
For school?

352
00:24:03.868 --> 00:24:05.900
No, we're not going to school.

353
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:07.400
Then where are we going?

354
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:09.167
Well, we're gonna
go on a little trip.


355
00:24:09.168 --> 00:24:11.413
- A trip?
- Uh-huh.


356
00:24:15.134 --> 00:24:17.900
Breaking news this morning
from the Albany Sun Times,


357
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:21.367
reporting former '70s radical
fugitive Nicholas Sloan


358
00:24:21.368 --> 00:24:25.667
has been discovered in Albany, living
as a lawyer named James Grant.


359
00:24:25.668 --> 00:24:30.917
Sloan is wanted for murder and has been
on the run for more than 30 years.


360
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:34.467
All right, people, what
do we have on Grant?


361
00:24:34.468 --> 00:24:37.834
His E-ZPass paid a toll at 4:00 this
morning on I-87, heading north.


362
00:24:37.835 --> 00:24:39.867
The border's already been alerted.

363
00:24:39.868 --> 00:24:41.667
We have an agent
talking to his secretary.


364
00:24:41.668 --> 00:24:43.066
Why don't we have a
better picture of Grant?


365
00:24:43.067 --> 00:24:44.234
We're working on it.

366
00:24:44.235 --> 00:24:48.374
- Well, what about from his house?
- Just waiting on the warrant.


367
00:24:56.601 --> 00:24:59.034
Their bodies are so bendy.

368
00:24:59.035 --> 00:25:01.816
You know this one's name?

369
00:25:03.402 --> 00:25:05.900
The border security cams are still being
checked. There's no matches yet.


370
00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:07.834
Does Grant have any family?

371
00:25:07.835 --> 00:25:09.400
Uh, a daughter, 11.

372
00:25:09.401 --> 00:25:11.267
Is she with him? 
Call the school.

373
00:25:11.268 --> 00:25:12.467
She didn't show.

374
00:25:12.468 --> 00:25:14.300
Both parents deceased,
brother in New York.


375
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:16.000
All right, put a
tail on the brother.


376
00:25:16.001 --> 00:25:19.800
I want bank accounts, credit
cards tracked, not frozen.


377
00:25:19.801 --> 00:25:21.934
Where are we on the Title Ill?

378
00:25:21.935 --> 00:25:23.834
I want a bug every place
this guy is known to go.


379
00:25:23.835 --> 00:25:27.800
I mean, somebody somewhere knows
something, and someone's going to talk.


380
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:28.867
Now, come on, people.

381
00:25:28.868 --> 00:25:31.034
This guy's been making us
look bad for 30 years now.


382
00:25:31.035 --> 00:25:33.577
Let's not be stupid.

383
00:25:33.635 --> 00:25:36.473
Welcome to the Rosewood.

384
00:25:39.668 --> 00:25:42.004
Right this way.

385
00:25:53.067 --> 00:25:55.701
- Just one moment.
- Mmm-hmm.


386
00:26:03.035 --> 00:26:04.501
- There you go.
- Thank you.


387
00:26:04.502 --> 00:26:06.934
- Enjoy your stay, Mr. Graves.
- Thank you.


388
00:26:06.935 --> 00:26:08.840
Bye.

389
00:26:46.002 --> 00:26:48.065
What's that?

390
00:26:49.035 --> 00:26:51.303
What's...

391
00:26:53.568 --> 00:26:54.900
What happened?

392
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:56.900
It's behind the napkin.

393
00:26:56.901 --> 00:26:59.600
- What?
- What?


394
00:26:59.601 --> 00:27:01.425
Eagle eyes.

395
00:27:01.635 --> 00:27:04.598
So, tell me something. What, uh...

396
00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:08.301
What was the best thing
that happened to you today?


397
00:27:08.302 --> 00:27:13.066
Um, well, I got a pet seal...

398
00:27:13.067 --> 00:27:16.133
Well, not a pet seal,
but a little seal doll.


399
00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:18.934
And does it... Did
you give it a name?


400
00:27:18.935 --> 00:27:20.998
I named her Harper.

401
00:27:21.268 --> 00:27:23.300
- Harper?
- Yeah.


402
00:27:23.301 --> 00:27:24.367
Why Harper?

403
00:27:24.368 --> 00:27:26.500
'Cause it's a harbor
seal, and now...


404
00:27:26.501 --> 00:27:27.701
- "Harbor."
- Yeah.


405
00:27:27.702 --> 00:27:29.967
So, it's Harper, harbor.
Harper, harbor.


406
00:27:29.968 --> 00:27:31.734
Oh, Harper, harbor.
Oh, I get the connection.


407
00:27:31.735 --> 00:27:35.266
So, right. Well, where is it?
Where's Harper?


408
00:27:36.235 --> 00:27:38.834
Hmm. Not there.

409
00:27:41.501 --> 00:27:45.339
Somebody you should love you
should keep close to, you know?


410
00:27:46.235 --> 00:27:47.734
We're disappointed in you.

411
00:27:48.235 --> 00:27:51.013
You're disappointed in me?

412
00:28:12.235 --> 00:28:16.403
Daniel Sloan is on the move.
We're tracking him.


413
00:28:47.335 --> 00:28:49.729
See you soon.

414
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:21.034
Daniel Sloan has stopped
at the Rosewood Hotel.


415
00:29:21.035 --> 00:29:23.906
We're keeping a safe distance.

416
00:30:12.602 --> 00:30:17.738
You two canvass the stairwell.
You take the elevators.


417
00:30:22.168 --> 00:30:24.868
Hey, what's that noise?

418
00:30:25.568 --> 00:30:27.400
It's the goddamn fire alarm.

419
00:30:27.401 --> 00:30:30.001
Okay, lock down the building
now. No one goes in or out.


420
00:30:30.002 --> 00:30:31.501
Not if there's a fire.

421
00:30:36.502 --> 00:30:39.430
Daddy? Dad!

422
00:30:39.735 --> 00:30:42.037
Come on.

423
00:30:48.268 --> 00:30:51.067
- Okay, what the hell is happening?
- They're evacuating the building.


424
00:30:51.068 --> 00:30:54.634
Shit! It's a diversion. It's...

425
00:30:54.635 --> 00:30:56.834
Contact the local police
and fire department.


426
00:30:56.835 --> 00:30:59.467
Notify them that we have
a dangerous fugitive.


427
00:30:59.468 --> 00:31:01.400
Send them a description
of Nicholas Sloan.


428
00:31:01.401 --> 00:31:03.667
All right, what do we have on
the brother, and where is he?


429
00:31:03.668 --> 00:31:06.500
I have no idea, and the
place is completely jammed.


430
00:31:06.501 --> 00:31:10.234
- There's too many people. I can't...
- I got 'em! East stairwell.


431
00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:11.867
Don't move! Stay right there!

432
00:31:11.868 --> 00:31:13.401
- Munro's got them.
- Don't move.


433
00:31:13.402 --> 00:31:16.234
I'm her uncle.
The girl is my niece.


434
00:31:16.235 --> 00:31:19.591
- I'm her guardian. I have papers.
- Let me see.


435
00:31:21.468 --> 00:31:24.305
Don't be scared. It's okay.

436
00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:28.834
He's got custody papers.

437
00:31:28.835 --> 00:31:30.267
It's Sloan's daughter.

438
00:31:30.268 --> 00:31:31.734
Jesus Christ.

439
00:31:31.735 --> 00:31:33.567
All right, he handed
her off. He can't be far.


440
00:31:33.568 --> 00:31:37.367
Send the second team down to the
basement and post two officers outside.


441
00:31:55.501 --> 00:31:58.001
Charles, around the corner.
Come with me.


442
00:31:58.002 --> 00:32:00.429
Eyes on the crowd.

443
00:32:00.868 --> 00:32:04.274
The subway! Woods,
let's check the subway!


444
00:32:33.935 --> 00:32:35.800
Nothing here.

445
00:32:35.801 --> 00:32:37.367
Let's go.

446
00:32:37.368 --> 00:32:38.767
Sir, we can't find him.

447
00:32:39.935 --> 00:32:42.271
Come on, people.

448
00:32:53.768 --> 00:32:56.133
Sir, how long have you been in
contact with Nicholas Sloan?


449
00:32:56.134 --> 00:32:57.201
No comment.

450
00:32:57.202 --> 00:32:58.400
Is that his daughter?

451
00:32:58.401 --> 00:32:59.567
No comment.

452
00:32:59.568 --> 00:33:00.634
I want to get her home.

453
00:33:00.635 --> 00:33:03.401
Fugitive terrorist Nicholas Sloan
had apparently been practicing law


454
00:33:03.402 --> 00:33:06.734
in Albany for three decades
under the name James Grant


455
00:33:06.735 --> 00:33:10.001
before he was exposed recently by a
reporter from the Albany Sun Times.


456
00:33:10.002 --> 00:33:14.000
This shit should already be
over. We need better intel.


457
00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:15.600
We've grilled the brother.

458
00:33:15.601 --> 00:33:17.434
Have we gotten anything
out of Sharon Solarz?


459
00:33:17.435 --> 00:33:18.934
No, she's refusing to talk.

460
00:33:18.935 --> 00:33:21.900
She'll talk to the local reporter.
She's already said.


461
00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:24.169
Well, what do we know about him?

462
00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:27.663
He's a nothing reporter. Local.

463
00:33:28.768 --> 00:33:31.734
Okay, let's get him in.

464
00:33:36.968 --> 00:33:38.867
- Can you try and pull it together?
- Of course.


465
00:33:38.868 --> 00:33:40.700
I'm serious. Cornelius
is already pissed.


466
00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:42.912
Yeah.

467
00:33:44.768 --> 00:33:46.467
Hello there.

468
00:33:46.468 --> 00:33:48.100
I'm Special Agent Cornelius.

469
00:33:48.101 --> 00:33:50.600
- You must be Shepard.
- Yep.


470
00:33:50.601 --> 00:33:52.133
The prisoner is
considered dangerous.


471
00:33:52.134 --> 00:33:54.400
You do not accept
anything from her,


472
00:33:54.401 --> 00:33:57.734
no letters, packages or
messages of any kind.


473
00:33:57.735 --> 00:34:00.333
Your time starts now.

474
00:34:05.902 --> 00:34:07.901
Hello.

475
00:34:07.902 --> 00:34:10.801
Well, you're much younger
than I thought you'd be.


476
00:34:10.802 --> 00:34:12.967
Well, that's always nice to hear.

477
00:34:12.968 --> 00:34:15.998
I didn't mean it as a compliment.

478
00:34:17.302 --> 00:34:18.971
Oh.

479
00:34:20.435 --> 00:34:21.967
Still, thank you.

480
00:34:21.968 --> 00:34:24.967
You did me a favor when
you wrote that article.


481
00:34:24.968 --> 00:34:26.667
I wouldn't mistake it for sympathy.

482
00:34:26.668 --> 00:34:29.066
No. Just clarity.

483
00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.972
Yeah.

484
00:34:31.468 --> 00:34:33.434
Clarity. So, let's talk clarity.

485
00:34:33.435 --> 00:34:35.339
Okay.

486
00:34:35.701 --> 00:34:38.700
You were on your way to
New York to turn yourself in?


487
00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:40.099
How does Billy Cusimano fit in?

488
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:45.099
Billy's my friend, and he did nothing
but encourage me to turn myself in


489
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.034
if I thought that that
would bring me peace.


490
00:34:47.035 --> 00:34:48.534
Mmm.

491
00:34:48.535 --> 00:34:51.300
You know his phone was tapped?

492
00:34:51.301 --> 00:34:54.411
Yeah. They got lucky.

493
00:34:57.935 --> 00:35:00.939
- And you got unlucky?
- Yeah.


494
00:35:01.035 --> 00:35:03.827
Why now, after 30 years?

495
00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:08.767
- You don't have kids, do you?
- No. I... I barely have furniture.


496
00:35:09.768 --> 00:35:13.835
Well, if you do, you'll realize
that they change you.


497
00:35:15.168 --> 00:35:17.300
- I have two.
- Mmm-hmm.


498
00:35:17.301 --> 00:35:19.434
A boy and a girl,

499
00:35:19.435 --> 00:35:23.634
and I waited until I thought
they were old enough


500
00:35:23.635 --> 00:35:29.373
to be able to handle it, but
still young enough that I can...


501
00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:40.946
So, was it a crisis of conscience?

502
00:35:41.134 --> 00:35:43.005
Hmm?

503
00:35:43.035 --> 00:35:46.434
Remorse for past transgressions
that became intolerable?


504
00:35:48.868 --> 00:35:52.194
The past 30 years in a sentence.

505
00:35:53.968 --> 00:35:57.864
Wow, it must be nice to
see the world so cleanly.


506
00:35:58.768 --> 00:36:01.241
Didn't you once?

507
00:36:04.468 --> 00:36:06.567
Most of us led very
sheltered lives.


508
00:36:06.568 --> 00:36:10.076
We had no real relationship
with violence.


509
00:36:10.235 --> 00:36:16.434
But at that time, all these
kids were taking to the streets


510
00:36:16.435 --> 00:36:22.082
in, uh, Japan and France,
China, Angola.


511
00:36:23.402 --> 00:36:25.567
There was revolution,
and I wanted to be part of it.


512
00:36:25.568 --> 00:36:28.599
Sure. Sounds groovy.

513
00:36:30.568 --> 00:36:33.301
You think we were all just a bunch

514
00:36:33.302 --> 00:36:36.572
of doped-up hippies running around.

515
00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:40.893
It was hardly groovy.

516
00:36:41.202 --> 00:36:43.367
Our government was
murdering millions,


517
00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:49.867
and we could see horrifying
images on the news, magazines.


518
00:36:49.868 --> 00:36:52.170
My Lai, Selma.

519
00:36:52.435 --> 00:36:54.701
It made us crazy. We
didn't know what to do.


520
00:36:54.702 --> 00:36:58.567
We... We, uh, protested,

521
00:36:58.568 --> 00:37:02.133
we sat in, we got
our skulls cracked


522
00:37:02.134 --> 00:37:05.767
and the war just kept escalating.

523
00:37:05.768 --> 00:37:10.061
And then there was Kent
State and Jackson State.


524
00:37:10.302 --> 00:37:13.767
Kids our age were being murdered

525
00:37:13.768 --> 00:37:17.902
by our government on campuses.

526
00:37:18.035 --> 00:37:19.567
It's not our finest hour.

527
00:37:19.568 --> 00:37:21.434
It wasn't abstract.

528
00:37:21.435 --> 00:37:23.863
There was a draft.

529
00:37:23.901 --> 00:37:25.801
You would have gotten a number,

530
00:37:25.802 --> 00:37:30.368
and then, all you
could do is just wait.


531
00:37:31.702 --> 00:37:34.734
And everybody knew somebody
that was going over,


532
00:37:34.735 --> 00:37:38.517
or somebody that was
not coming back.


533
00:37:39.402 --> 00:37:40.801
You never get over that.

534
00:37:40.802 --> 00:37:42.866
Apparently not.

535
00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:47.174
It sounds to me like justification.

536
00:37:47.702 --> 00:37:49.600
I find it hard to believe
that the only option


537
00:37:49.601 --> 00:37:51.334
available to you at the
time was violence.


538
00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:55.201
We thought that sitting at home while
your government committed genocide


539
00:37:55.202 --> 00:37:58.734
and doing nothing about it,
that that was violence.


540
00:38:03.635 --> 00:38:05.779
What about you?

541
00:38:08.268 --> 00:38:11.947
What are you willing
to take a risk for?


542
00:38:13.235 --> 00:38:16.034
I don't know. I know that I
wouldn't blow up a building.


543
00:38:16.035 --> 00:38:18.534
I wouldn't kill
anybody for anything.


544
00:38:18.535 --> 00:38:22.704
Yeah, well, dissent can be dicey.

545
00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:27.333
You can't get to my age
without some regrets.


546
00:38:29.568 --> 00:38:32.234
Would you do it again?

547
00:38:34.702 --> 00:38:36.913
If...

548
00:38:37.035 --> 00:38:39.827
I didn't have kids and

549
00:38:40.268 --> 00:38:43.173
old parents that I love...

550
00:38:45.468 --> 00:38:48.613
Yeah, I would do it again.

551
00:38:50.134 --> 00:38:54.246
Smarter, better, different.

552
00:38:57.035 --> 00:38:59.827
But I'd do it, yeah.

553
00:39:01.134 --> 00:39:03.563
We made mistakes.

554
00:39:04.735 --> 00:39:07.133
But we were right.

555
00:39:07.134 --> 00:39:09.380
Hmm.

556
00:39:11.035 --> 00:39:13.701
And is Nick Sloan right?

557
00:39:13.702 --> 00:39:16.967
He has a daughter much younger than
yours that he abandoned in a hotel room.


558
00:39:16.968 --> 00:39:19.067
People do what they have to do.

559
00:39:19.068 --> 00:39:21.901
Well, what are you doing
then, here, with me?


560
00:39:21.902 --> 00:39:25.001
I mean, you had a... You had
a choice in all this, after all.


561
00:39:25.002 --> 00:39:27.767
Well, look at me. It doesn't
matter what I say, unless...


562
00:39:27.768 --> 00:39:32.061
I say it to somebody who's
interested in the truth.


563
00:39:32.202 --> 00:39:36.530
And it seems as if you're
interested in the truth.


564
00:39:36.701 --> 00:39:39.208
Most people aren't.

565
00:39:40.435 --> 00:39:43.226
What are you gonna do?

566
00:39:43.735 --> 00:39:45.946
My job.

567
00:39:48.268 --> 00:39:50.662
Good.

568
00:39:55.768 --> 00:39:59.901
And what do you
think Jim... Nick...


569
00:39:59.902 --> 00:40:03.080
What do you think he's doing now?

570
00:40:05.268 --> 00:40:08.301
Maybe you should figure that out.

571
00:40:08.302 --> 00:40:10.092
Hmm.

572
00:40:11.901 --> 00:40:17.601
Look, if my coming here in any
way was responsible for him


573
00:40:17.602 --> 00:40:22.201
being found out, well, that was not
my intention, and he knows that.


574
00:40:22.202 --> 00:40:27.215
We never betrayed each other, not
once, any of us, over all these years.


575
00:40:29.802 --> 00:40:32.833
And I'm not about to start now.

576
00:40:33.602 --> 00:40:35.867
What about Mimi Lurie?

577
00:40:35.868 --> 00:40:38.401
Is she out there living a good,
clean, productive life?


578
00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:40.909
Anything's possible.

579
00:40:41.735 --> 00:40:44.276
Mimi and Nick

580
00:40:45.635 --> 00:40:47.733
were different.

581
00:40:48.202 --> 00:40:50.801
Radicals, yes, but also lovers.

582
00:40:50.802 --> 00:40:52.934
Mmm-hmm. Did you...

583
00:40:52.935 --> 00:40:55.568
Time's up, sir.

584
00:41:00.768 --> 00:41:03.469
Thank you for talking to me.

585
00:41:04.368 --> 00:41:07.034
Thank you for listening.

586
00:41:13.035 --> 00:41:15.280
Hmm.

587
00:41:20.134 --> 00:41:23.034
They did unforgivable things, but you
gotta appreciate the commitment.


588
00:41:23.035 --> 00:41:25.301
No, you don't.
You appreciate the fact


589
00:41:25.302 --> 00:41:27.967
that the bank guard they
murdered had two small kids.


590
00:41:27.968 --> 00:41:30.267
It's just hard to reconcile
the woman with her past.


591
00:41:30.268 --> 00:41:31.967
- Sir.
- Don't allow yourself to get spun


592
00:41:31.968 --> 00:41:34.301
- by these people.
- I don't get spun.


593
00:41:34.302 --> 00:41:36.967
Well, you've been pretty soft
on her from the very beginning.


594
00:41:36.968 --> 00:41:39.467
We're the good guys here,
but you seem not to care.


595
00:41:39.468 --> 00:41:42.934
You write an article that blasts my
team publicly for doing our jobs well,


596
00:41:42.935 --> 00:41:44.934
- and you make her out to be the victim.
- I didn't blast anybody.


597
00:41:44.935 --> 00:41:46.300
She was turning herself in.
That's what I wrote.


598
00:41:46.301 --> 00:41:49.434
No, there was no deal. We had intel,
we tracked her, we made the arrest.


599
00:41:49.435 --> 00:41:50.767
Now where's that article?

600
00:41:50.768 --> 00:41:54.167
We took a 30-year fugitive off the
street and would have gotten her partner


601
00:41:54.168 --> 00:41:56.401
if it hadn't been for some
two-bit journalist interfering.


602
00:41:56.402 --> 00:41:59.801
Would you even know who
he was if it wasn't for me?


603
00:41:59.802 --> 00:42:03.434
Well, you do seem awfully
tied in to these people.


604
00:42:03.435 --> 00:42:07.567
Solarz only talks to you, you meet with
Sloan two days before he disappears,


605
00:42:07.568 --> 00:42:10.534
giving him a big head
start, if not more.


606
00:42:10.535 --> 00:42:14.401
Perhaps you're a little more
interesting than I initially thought.


607
00:42:14.402 --> 00:42:18.267
We're bringing these people down,
and I hope I don't find you in my way.


608
00:42:18.268 --> 00:42:22.049
Agent, I need you to
report to an OPR review.


609
00:42:24.602 --> 00:42:26.300
Don't ever ask me
for anything again.


610
00:42:26.301 --> 00:42:27.934
What are you talking about?
I thought we were bonding.


611
00:42:27.935 --> 00:42:30.066
I feel like I just watched
you get hypnotized in there.


612
00:42:30.067 --> 00:42:32.133
"I was just young, female
and opposing injustice"?


613
00:42:32.134 --> 00:42:33.967
That's her justification?
That was offensive.


614
00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:36.267
I'm not arguing that point.

615
00:42:36.268 --> 00:42:38.567
Where are you guys on the Sloan
thing? You think you can find him?


616
00:42:38.568 --> 00:42:41.934
I think he knows how to run,
which means he has an advantage.


617
00:42:41.935 --> 00:42:46.262
Terrorists justify terrorism, Ben.
Don't get confused here.


618
00:42:49.067 --> 00:42:51.336
Mmm.

619
00:42:56.602 --> 00:42:58.901
Welcome to Milwaukee...

620
00:43:18.302 --> 00:43:20.601
Excuse me, ma'am.

621
00:43:20.602 --> 00:43:23.701
Pardon me. Excuse me.

622
00:43:23.702 --> 00:43:25.567
Excuse me.

623
00:43:25.568 --> 00:43:27.067
Thank you.

624
00:43:27.068 --> 00:43:30.702
Don't tell me you have to go
when you don't have to go.


625
00:43:38.935 --> 00:43:41.602
Hey, hands off, bro!

626
00:44:07.968 --> 00:44:09.034
Hello?

627
00:44:09.035 --> 00:44:11.734
This is Ben Shepard,
Albany Sun Times.


628
00:44:11.735 --> 00:44:13.301
Yes?

629
00:44:13.302 --> 00:44:18.034
Dr. Sloan, I've spoken directly to your
brother, I've spoken to Sharon Solarz.


630
00:44:18.035 --> 00:44:19.834
- Yes?
- I have something to tell you, sir.


631
00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:21.234
It's important that we speak.

632
00:44:21.235 --> 00:44:22.901
Go ahead. Be quick.

633
00:44:22.902 --> 00:44:24.800
Two minutes, but not
over the phone.


634
00:44:24.801 --> 00:44:28.207
I don't trust phones. Yours
or mine, for that matter.


635
00:44:28.235 --> 00:44:30.034
You get here before ten.

636
00:44:30.035 --> 00:44:33.715
Perfect. Thank you, sir.

637
00:44:35.067 --> 00:44:38.234
Yes, we are currently outside
the home of Dr. Daniel Sloan,


638
00:44:38.235 --> 00:44:40.100
brother of fugitive Nick Sloan.

639
00:44:40.101 --> 00:44:42.767
We have no new information
to report at this time,


640
00:44:42.768 --> 00:44:44.401
but we are continuing to
monitor the situation...


641
00:44:44.402 --> 00:44:45.901
- Ben Shepard.
- Yeah?


642
00:44:45.902 --> 00:44:47.401
- Albany Sun Times.
- Yeah.


643
00:44:47.402 --> 00:44:49.067
Maulik Bhanjali, Reuters.

644
00:44:49.068 --> 00:44:52.434
- Hey, what's going on?
- No interviews.


645
00:44:52.435 --> 00:44:55.033
- No interviews?
- Yeah.


646
00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:59.133
Hi. Uh, Ben Shepard,
Albany Sun Times.


647
00:44:59.134 --> 00:45:00.767
Dr. Sloan's expecting to see me.

648
00:45:00.768 --> 00:45:02.967
Yes, he is, sir.
You can go right up.


649
00:45:02.968 --> 00:45:05.145
Thank you.

650
00:45:11.868 --> 00:45:13.901
Dr. Sloan? Ben Shepard.
I'm sorry I'm late.


651
00:45:13.902 --> 00:45:15.334
Ah, yes. Yeah.

652
00:45:15.335 --> 00:45:17.239
Thank you.

653
00:45:19.935 --> 00:45:22.237
Beautiful.

654
00:45:23.202 --> 00:45:26.563
So, tell me what
you need to tell me.


655
00:45:26.702 --> 00:45:29.994
Wh... Okay, um...

656
00:45:31.101 --> 00:45:34.467
Well, your brother obviously
counted on you a great deal.


657
00:45:34.468 --> 00:45:35.901
Were you two close, growing up?

658
00:45:35.902 --> 00:45:39.701
He was my older brother.
I looked up to him.


659
00:45:39.702 --> 00:45:43.666
I was a kid. I didn't
understand what he was doing.


660
00:45:44.801 --> 00:45:47.534
You said you had
something to tell me.


661
00:45:47.535 --> 00:45:49.734
I'm just trying to figure out
why you're helping him.


662
00:45:49.735 --> 00:45:52.301
Well, I'm helping my niece.
She's innocent in all of this.


663
00:45:52.302 --> 00:45:55.412
Mmm-hmm. And your brother?

664
00:45:55.802 --> 00:45:58.301
They blew up buildings.
It's been well documented.


665
00:45:58.302 --> 00:46:01.743
- Do you approve of that?
- Of course not.


666
00:46:01.902 --> 00:46:03.934
Now, if you have
nothing more to ask...


667
00:46:03.935 --> 00:46:06.367
Do you think he's coming
back for his daughter?


668
00:46:06.368 --> 00:46:08.401
- Is that what he's doing?
- Excuse me?


669
00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:10.601
I'm trying to understand his
thinking process. I mean...


670
00:46:10.602 --> 00:46:12.634
Why not take his daughter with him?

671
00:46:12.635 --> 00:46:14.234
You know, why not change
his name, disappear?


672
00:46:14.235 --> 00:46:15.901
He obviously knows how to do that.

673
00:46:15.902 --> 00:46:18.133
You said you had
something to tell me.


674
00:46:18.134 --> 00:46:22.100
Obviously that's not the case,
so I think we're done here.


675
00:46:22.101 --> 00:46:25.064
We didn't ask for this.

676
00:46:25.101 --> 00:46:27.201
I don't condone what he did,

677
00:46:27.202 --> 00:46:30.301
and I certainly don't appreciate you
manipulating your way into my house.


678
00:46:30.302 --> 00:46:31.367
You need to leave.

679
00:46:31.368 --> 00:46:33.301
Are you enrolling her in school?

680
00:46:34.368 --> 00:46:35.434
'Cause I'll tell you,

681
00:46:35.435 --> 00:46:38.301
this situation doesn't look like
a permanent situation to me,


682
00:46:38.302 --> 00:46:41.048
and I'm guessing not to you either.

683
00:46:41.202 --> 00:46:43.596
What is he doing?

684
00:46:44.035 --> 00:46:48.133
- Buying himself time for something.
- I don't know. For what?


685
00:46:49.035 --> 00:46:51.782
I don't know. I'm asking you.

686
00:46:51.902 --> 00:46:57.670
Your brother's nothing if he's not
logical, and right now nothing he's doing


687
00:46:58.568 --> 00:47:01.894
makes any sense if he's guilty.

688
00:47:41.302 --> 00:47:43.662
Help yourself.

689
00:47:49.968 --> 00:47:52.804
You know, you should...

690
00:47:54.535 --> 00:47:56.838
Holy shit.

691
00:47:59.868 --> 00:48:03.194
It's right over here. Lumberyard.

692
00:48:09.201 --> 00:48:11.367
Don't worry, nobody's watching.

693
00:48:11.368 --> 00:48:14.367
They're on Daniel. They'll
get to you soon enough.


694
00:48:14.368 --> 00:48:18.605
Yeah, well, anyone works
for me is an ex-con anyway.


695
00:48:19.468 --> 00:48:21.467
Boy, this is some
operation you got here.


696
00:48:21.468 --> 00:48:27.331
Yeah, yeah. You got redwood,
you got pine, cedar, too.


697
00:48:27.535 --> 00:48:30.301
Western red cedar.
You can smell it.


698
00:48:30.302 --> 00:48:32.567
It's environmentally certified.

699
00:48:32.568 --> 00:48:35.001
Yeah, I can see you're still into
herbal teas and soy products.


700
00:48:35.002 --> 00:48:37.066
Yeah, well, you know.

701
00:48:37.067 --> 00:48:40.800
I quit drinking and smoking,
and I gained weight and I...


702
00:48:40.801 --> 00:48:43.367
Shit, man, why am
I telling you this?


703
00:48:43.368 --> 00:48:48.091
I don't belong to the Collective
anymore. I don't answer to you.


704
00:48:48.402 --> 00:48:53.231
I need a place to stay tonight, and a
couple of questions answered, Donal.


705
00:48:57.202 --> 00:49:00.130
Okay, you can crash at my place.

706
00:49:02.702 --> 00:49:05.540
Hey, it's this, this truck.

707
00:49:09.702 --> 00:49:12.467
That guy looks a little bit
like Rick. Remember him?


708
00:49:12.468 --> 00:49:14.301
The roadie from Monterey?

709
00:49:14.302 --> 00:49:17.834
That is Rick,
the roadie from Monterey.


710
00:49:19.101 --> 00:49:21.534
Jesus, I thought he died.

711
00:49:21.535 --> 00:49:24.667
We all died. Some of us came back.

712
00:49:33.402 --> 00:49:35.934
- Keep in touch with anybody else?
- A few.


713
00:49:35.935 --> 00:49:39.834
Steve and Penny, Carol there
in New York and, uh...


714
00:49:39.835 --> 00:49:41.100
Who else? Let's see.

715
00:49:41.101 --> 00:49:42.501
Oh, I go visit Noah, you know?

716
00:49:42.502 --> 00:49:43.601
Oh, yeah?

717
00:49:43.602 --> 00:49:45.467
Yeah, he's in Lompoc, you know.

718
00:49:45.468 --> 00:49:47.601
I see him a
couple of times a year.

719
00:49:47.602 --> 00:49:51.600
And, uh, Little Sweeney
and Laura, Horse...


720
00:49:51.601 --> 00:49:54.233
Do you know where she is, Donal?

721
00:49:55.302 --> 00:49:56.634
No, man. I don't.

722
00:49:56.635 --> 00:49:58.867
After the bank, Sharon
came to you for help.


723
00:49:58.868 --> 00:50:00.367
Really? How do you know that?

724
00:50:00.368 --> 00:50:04.600
Because of the name she lived under
before she married her current husband.


725
00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:07.967
It was in the papers when
she was arrested. Coyle.


726
00:50:07.968 --> 00:50:10.749
That was you when you
went under in '72.


727
00:50:11.702 --> 00:50:14.601
I figured you got married and
gave her a new identity...


728
00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:18.100
...and then she went somewhere else,
and then after a couple of years,


729
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:19.634
you gave an uncontested divorce

730
00:50:19.635 --> 00:50:24.767
and left her with the name.
Right? Am I right?


731
00:50:24.768 --> 00:50:26.301
Did Mimi come to you, too?

732
00:50:26.302 --> 00:50:29.867
Well now, why would Mimi
come to me? You know...


733
00:50:29.868 --> 00:50:34.234
Shit, man, this is a real
shit-kicker of a question to...


734
00:50:34.235 --> 00:50:38.601
I mean, to show up and ask me
to trust you with information


735
00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:41.367
that makes me an
accessory to murder.


736
00:50:41.368 --> 00:50:46.301
Neither of them had any fucking right
to ask me a thing, and neither do you.


737
00:50:46.302 --> 00:50:49.301
I mean, I wasn't with
you guys for the B of M.


738
00:50:49.302 --> 00:50:51.066
I wasn't even on a damn committee.

739
00:50:51.067 --> 00:50:53.167
I was the fuck out of it,
and you know that.


740
00:50:53.168 --> 00:50:54.567
- Did she come to you or not?
- All right.


741
00:50:54.568 --> 00:50:56.434
- Just tell me, for Christ's sake.
- All right.


742
00:50:56.435 --> 00:50:58.001
You know better than anyone.

743
00:50:58.002 --> 00:51:02.867
Mimi was not going to be some
kind of suburban housewife,


744
00:51:02.868 --> 00:51:05.898
drive a minivan and go to the PTA.

745
00:51:05.902 --> 00:51:08.501
She was going to live or
die a freedom fighter.


746
00:51:08.502 --> 00:51:10.901
She was married to the movement.

747
00:51:10.902 --> 00:51:16.003
The last I heard about her,
she was on her way to Cuba.


748
00:51:22.368 --> 00:51:26.201
Ten houses down, the one
with the green windows,


749
00:51:26.202 --> 00:51:29.802
but go around to the
side to the kitchen.


750
00:51:33.702 --> 00:51:36.095
Now what about you?

751
00:51:36.602 --> 00:51:40.383
Why didn't you come to
me for help back then?


752
00:51:40.568 --> 00:51:43.734
- I didn't want to go too far.
- Too far?


753
00:51:43.735 --> 00:51:46.401
Wow, you stayed?

754
00:51:46.402 --> 00:51:49.834
Yeah, for a while. I thought
she might come back.


755
00:51:49.835 --> 00:51:52.867
Who? Lurie?

756
00:51:52.868 --> 00:51:56.767
Come back? Aw, come on.
Get real, man.


757
00:51:56.768 --> 00:52:00.067
Mimi Lurie is nothing but
a dream you once had.


758
00:52:30.168 --> 00:52:31.867
Afternoon, ma'am.

759
00:52:31.868 --> 00:52:34.100
Are you aware you're
inside the shipping lane?


760
00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:35.801
Oh, so sorry, Captain.

761
00:52:35.802 --> 00:52:37.967
We're practicing for
the Catalina Cup,


762
00:52:37.968 --> 00:52:40.301
but we're too fast to
get in anyone's way.


763
00:52:40.302 --> 00:52:42.567
Roger that. Just stay east of 122.

764
00:52:42.568 --> 00:52:44.904
Aye, aye. Captain!

765
00:53:05.202 --> 00:53:08.278
You good? Got it?

766
00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:27.838
Hi, Terri.

767
00:53:30.134 --> 00:53:32.972
Thank God for government bonds.

768
00:53:33.035 --> 00:53:37.237
My accountant used to laugh
at me for being risk-averse.


769
00:53:37.968 --> 00:53:41.067
Oh, don't give me that
"capitalist dog" look.


770
00:53:41.068 --> 00:53:43.100
Going legit has its advantages.

771
00:53:43.101 --> 00:53:47.701
Sure, as long as bankrupting
people's pension funds remains legit


772
00:53:47.702 --> 00:53:52.143
and running good, honest
weed remains criminal.


773
00:53:55.035 --> 00:53:57.303
You're gonna want to look at that.

774
00:53:57.768 --> 00:54:00.275
I saved it for you.

775
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:03.034
Sharon Solarz.

776
00:54:03.035 --> 00:54:06.334
A housewife in Vermont.
You believe it?


777
00:54:06.335 --> 00:54:07.634
Shit.

778
00:54:07.635 --> 00:54:09.534
And Billy Cusimano.

779
00:54:09.535 --> 00:54:12.605
- Who?
- From the Brotherhood.


780
00:54:13.235 --> 00:54:16.676
Nice to know old Billy's
keeping the flame alive.


781
00:54:18.735 --> 00:54:22.631
And Nick Sloan,
a lawyer from Albany.


782
00:54:22.702 --> 00:54:26.001
Christ. How'd he manage
to pull that one off?


783
00:54:26.002 --> 00:54:28.361
That's what he always wanted.

784
00:54:29.635 --> 00:54:32.780
As I recall, you two
were pretty tight.


785
00:54:33.535 --> 00:54:35.801
I don't know. It was
a long time ago.


786
00:54:35.802 --> 00:54:41.360
So, why do you think she decided to
turn herself in after all these years?


787
00:54:41.768 --> 00:54:44.241
I don't know, Mac.

788
00:54:46.001 --> 00:54:49.231
- I guess she got tired.
- Yeah.


789
00:54:49.568 --> 00:54:51.995
Times change, babe.

790
00:54:53.668 --> 00:54:56.004
Types maybe.

791
00:54:56.802 --> 00:54:59.067
Mr. McGowan, this is Ben
Shepard calling again


792
00:54:59.068 --> 00:55:01.834
from the Albany Sun
Times newspaper.


793
00:55:01.835 --> 00:55:04.667
Uh, as I said, this is regarding
the research that we're doing


794
00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:08.301
on the Bank of Michigan robbery,
and I would appreciate a call back.


795
00:55:08.302 --> 00:55:12.562
My number is 518-555-1218.

796
00:55:27.902 --> 00:55:29.649
Hello?

797
00:55:53.168 --> 00:55:56.133
Oh, f... You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me.


798
00:55:56.134 --> 00:55:58.601
- The FBI was in my apartment.
- I don't need this right now.


799
00:55:58.602 --> 00:56:00.034
Look, search warrant.
No probable cause.


800
00:56:00.035 --> 00:56:01.434
- That's a story, right?
- It's not a story.


801
00:56:01.435 --> 00:56:03.434
They're pissed because I'm doing
their job better than they are.


802
00:56:03.435 --> 00:56:05.534
- Well, you know how to make friends.
- It's not about making friends.


803
00:56:05.535 --> 00:56:08.701
It's about making history.
We're talking about history now.


804
00:56:10.011 --> 00:56:12.634
I got your request.

805
00:56:12.635 --> 00:56:14.167
I can't send you to Michigan.

806
00:56:14.168 --> 00:56:16.401
You have to send me to Michigan.
She's being indicted in Michigan.


807
00:56:16.402 --> 00:56:18.234
- We'll get it from the wires.
- No, wires are shit.


808
00:56:18.235 --> 00:56:20.367
This is big. I'm putting us on the map.
People know my name, Ray.


809
00:56:20.368 --> 00:56:22.234
- You have to send me out there.
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.


810
00:56:22.235 --> 00:56:24.034
Have some fucking awareness, okay?

811
00:56:24.035 --> 00:56:27.167
This isn't all about you. I just
laid off my sports department.


812
00:56:27.168 --> 00:56:30.500
Well, who gives a shit about Albany High
girls' soccer? What are we talking about?


813
00:56:30.501 --> 00:56:31.600
- Don't be an asshole.
- I'm not being an asshole.


814
00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:34.133
Why are you acting like
we're not killing it right now?


815
00:56:34.134 --> 00:56:35.467
I'm on the fucking 10-yard line.

816
00:56:35.468 --> 00:56:38.667
I'm on the 10-yard line.
You're stopping me right now.


817
00:56:38.668 --> 00:56:39.967
- That's a bad article.
- It's a bad ar...


818
00:56:39.968 --> 00:56:41.734
It's an exclusive with
the guy's brother.


819
00:56:41.735 --> 00:56:42.977
- It's a bad article.
- You took a shot at him.


820
00:56:42.978 --> 00:56:44.800
- You made it personal.
- He's a schmuck, Ray.


821
00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:48.246
I don't fucking care what he is.

822
00:56:48.368 --> 00:56:51.034
That's not what we do,
and this is not the first time!


823
00:56:51.035 --> 00:56:52.334
You don't just destroy someone

824
00:56:52.335 --> 00:56:54.133
- to see if you can uncover something!
- You're a fucking idiot.


825
00:56:54.134 --> 00:56:56.467
That's a shitty way to
go about things! Got it?


826
00:56:56.468 --> 00:56:58.534
The fact that we're even having
this conversation is ridiculous.


827
00:56:58.535 --> 00:56:59.634
- Well, we're having it.
- I gave you an exclusive


828
00:56:59.635 --> 00:57:01.401
with Sharon Solarz,
with the guy's brother.


829
00:57:01.402 --> 00:57:03.667
Nick Sloan would still be defending
spotted owls if it wasn't for me.


830
00:57:03.668 --> 00:57:05.467
Nobody can do what I am doing, Ray.

831
00:57:05.468 --> 00:57:08.267
- Allen Springer returning.
- I gotta call him back.


832
00:57:08.268 --> 00:57:11.034
I'm in this in a big way.
I need support now, Ray.


833
00:57:11.035 --> 00:57:12.634
I need you to support me.

834
00:57:12.635 --> 00:57:15.239
And you need to stop provoking
people, especially the FBI.


835
00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.496
- I...
- Okay?


836
00:57:16.497 --> 00:57:18.196
Okay.

837
00:57:20.635 --> 00:57:23.108
I got bosses, too, you know.

838
00:57:31.202 --> 00:57:32.701
So, what are you thinking?

839
00:57:32.702 --> 00:57:34.300
You know, I'm still wrapping
my head around it.


840
00:57:34.301 --> 00:57:38.135
These people are... They're all nuts,
but none of them are illogical.


841
00:57:38.568 --> 00:57:41.534
You know, if this man is trying to
escape, if he was trying to disappear,


842
00:57:41.535 --> 00:57:43.001
he'd have taken his
daughter with him.


843
00:57:43.002 --> 00:57:46.001
- Maybe.
- But he didn't.


844
00:57:46.002 --> 00:57:49.167
Instead, he conducts a very risky
and complicated series of switches,


845
00:57:49.168 --> 00:57:53.305
gets his daughter into safekeeping,
gets to New York by himself, alone,


846
00:57:53.602 --> 00:57:55.634
which changes everything, right?
I mean, if the guy is innocent


847
00:57:55.635 --> 00:57:59.500
and he's running because he's innocent,
why doesn't Sharon just clear him?


848
00:57:59.501 --> 00:58:01.133
Because she's in custody,
and she was his partner


849
00:58:01.134 --> 00:58:02.801
and that doesn't hold up in court.

850
00:58:02.802 --> 00:58:05.834
Yeah, but why hide for 30
years if you're innocent?


851
00:58:05.835 --> 00:58:07.567
Innocence only gets you so far.

852
00:58:07.568 --> 00:58:09.667
Michigan number.
It's where it all started.


853
00:58:09.668 --> 00:58:10.967
But you're not going to Michigan.

854
00:58:10.968 --> 00:58:16.035
Ben Shepard. Miss McGowan,
thank you for calling me...


855
00:58:19.002 --> 00:58:20.974
He is.

856
00:58:21.335 --> 00:58:26.367
I'm sorry for your loss.
Okay. Bye-bye.


857
00:58:26.368 --> 00:58:28.671
Fuck.

858
00:59:19.134 --> 00:59:20.201
Donal?

859
00:59:20.202 --> 00:59:22.174
Donal!

860
00:59:42.902 --> 00:59:48.333
Hey, hey! Hey! What
are you doing, man?


861
00:59:50.101 --> 00:59:51.301
What are you doing?

862
00:59:51.302 --> 00:59:53.639
I went to get you a car.

863
00:59:54.602 --> 00:59:56.434
Oh, shit.

864
00:59:56.835 --> 01:00:00.708
Oh, what, you thought
I ran out on you?


865
01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:03.066
I thought...

866
01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:05.901
...maybe you realized what
a risk you were taking for...


867
01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.801
For a guy you hardly know.

868
01:00:07.802 --> 01:00:11.667
Hey, do you remember,
we used to be best of friends?


869
01:00:11.668 --> 01:00:13.698
You remember that?

870
01:00:17.301 --> 01:00:19.330
Yeah.

871
01:00:19.435 --> 01:00:21.201
Here's the key. It's clean.

872
01:00:21.202 --> 01:00:24.130
It'll get you out of town at least.

873
01:00:30.268 --> 01:00:32.967
Call the cops in the morning.

874
01:00:32.968 --> 01:00:35.534
Tell them I came to see you,
asking for help, and you refused


875
01:00:35.535 --> 01:00:38.734
because you're an upstanding,
law-abiding citizen.


876
01:00:39.815 --> 01:00:41.867
Oh, jeez.

877
01:00:41.868 --> 01:00:44.501
All right, now listen to me.

878
01:00:44.502 --> 01:00:49.809
Mimi did come to me. I put
her in touch with Jed Lewis.


879
01:00:49.902 --> 01:00:54.467
He made some introductions,
political friends in Havana.


880
01:00:54.468 --> 01:00:55.601
- Jed Lewis?
- Yeah.


881
01:00:55.602 --> 01:00:57.301
I thought Jed was above ground.
How could he pull...


882
01:00:57.302 --> 01:01:02.278
No, no, no, no. He's got
the list, so he can find her.


883
01:01:03.302 --> 01:01:06.230
All right, fucking run, man.

884
01:01:08.568 --> 01:01:10.133
Call you back.

885
01:01:25.802 --> 01:01:27.234
A security guard is dead

886
01:01:27.235 --> 01:01:30.534
after a robbery turned
violent at Briarwood Mall.


887
01:01:30.535 --> 01:01:32.267
At five minutes after 8:00 a.m.

888
01:01:32.268 --> 01:01:34.034
a man and a woman,
masked and armed,


889
01:01:34.035 --> 01:01:37.300
entered the local branch
of the Bank of Michigan.


890
01:01:37.301 --> 01:01:39.967
An exchange of gunfire
occurred between the suspects,


891
01:01:39.968 --> 01:01:43.334
and bank security guard Hugh Krosney,
pronounced dead at the scene.


892
01:01:43.335 --> 01:01:46.167
According to investigating
officer Henry Osborne,


893
01:01:46.168 --> 01:01:48.248
the investigation is considered
active and ongoing...


894
01:01:54.134 --> 01:01:56.278
"Osborne."

895
01:01:57.134 --> 01:01:58.301
Hello?

896
01:01:58.302 --> 01:01:59.467
Hi, my name is Ben Shepard.

897
01:01:59.468 --> 01:02:03.201
I'm calling from the Albany Sun
Times newspaper, Albany, New York.


898
01:02:03.202 --> 01:02:05.630
I should hope so.

899
01:02:07.134 --> 01:02:09.066
I've left a couple messages.

900
01:02:09.067 --> 01:02:11.200
I'm trying to locate
Police Chief Henry Osborne.


901
01:02:11.201 --> 01:02:12.334
Former Police Chief.

902
01:02:12.335 --> 01:02:14.133
Yeah, well, I just wanted to
ask him a couple of questions


903
01:02:14.134 --> 01:02:16.201
regarding the recent
Sharon Solarz arrest.


904
01:02:16.202 --> 01:02:17.534
He is still...

905
01:02:17.535 --> 01:02:19.508
Alive?

906
01:02:19.668 --> 01:02:20.767
Well, yeah.

907
01:02:20.768 --> 01:02:24.643
Well, he'd better be, or I'm on my
way to the yacht club to see a ghost.


908
01:02:24.768 --> 01:02:26.234
Um...

909
01:02:26.835 --> 01:02:30.834
Um, see, I'm here in Detroit doing some
research, and from my understanding,


910
01:02:30.835 --> 01:02:33.501
his department was pretty involved in
the Bank of Michigan investigation.


911
01:02:33.502 --> 01:02:35.601
I just wanted to ask him a
couple of questions about that.


912
01:02:35.602 --> 01:02:37.100
He's not here right now.

913
01:02:37.101 --> 01:02:41.367
- Oh, I'm just doing a little background.
- But he's still not here.


914
01:02:41.368 --> 01:02:42.834
Well, how about this?
Can I give you my number,


915
01:02:42.835 --> 01:02:44.434
and then maybe you
can pass it to him?


916
01:02:44.435 --> 01:02:46.667
I'd really appreciate it.
I'm quite harmless.


917
01:02:46.668 --> 01:02:47.534
Really?

918
01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:52.834
Uh... The number's 518-555-1218.

919
01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:55.401
That's my office, and I'm
calling you from my cell.


920
01:02:55.402 --> 01:02:58.001
- Thanks for your time.
- Mmm-hmm.


921
01:02:58.002 --> 01:03:01.501
The manhunt for Nicholas Sloan
continues at this time in Milwaukee,


922
01:03:01.502 --> 01:03:04.167
where former Weather Underground
member Donal Fitzgerald


923
01:03:04.168 --> 01:03:06.133
was taken into custody today.

924
01:03:06.134 --> 01:03:08.201
Federal authorities
suspect Mr. Fitzgerald


925
01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:10.501
of aiding and abetting
Nicholas Sloan,


926
01:03:10.502 --> 01:03:13.601
who continues to elude federal
investigators. Sloan's identity...


927
01:03:13.602 --> 01:03:15.834
Nick went to Donal.

928
01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:17.634
He's trying to find me.

929
01:03:17.635 --> 01:03:20.632
You're safe here. 
You can lie low.

930
01:03:22.901 --> 01:03:25.648
You know, I counted last night.

931
01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:29.162
I've walked out on six lives.

932
01:03:29.735 --> 01:03:35.531
Six sets of friends, six
lovers, six homes, six names.


933
01:03:35.935 --> 01:03:37.834
Not including my own.

934
01:03:37.835 --> 01:03:40.967
- So, you're moving on again?
- Mmm-hmm.


935
01:03:40.968 --> 01:03:44.498
- You want to take the boat?
- Mmm-mmm.


936
01:03:44.702 --> 01:03:48.258
- No, I'm going inland.
- Well...


937
01:03:48.335 --> 01:03:52.446
- The door's always open.
- Thanks, Mac.


938
01:03:57.402 --> 01:03:59.701
You submit one goddamn
receipt from this trip,


939
01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:01.300
you're fired on the spot. Got it?

940
01:04:01.301 --> 01:04:02.867
Yeah, right, like you
haven't said that before.


941
01:04:02.868 --> 01:04:06.400
Don't fuck with me, Ben.
I'm not in the mood.


942
01:04:06.401 --> 01:04:10.267
- So, are you in Milwaukee?
- No, I'm in Michigan.


943
01:04:10.268 --> 01:04:13.834
- Your guy was spotted in Milwaukee.
- I know that. I saw it on the news.


944
01:04:13.835 --> 01:04:15.634
And here I thought
we were the news.


945
01:04:15.635 --> 01:04:18.167
Look, I'm working on it, Ray,
all right? I'm busting my ass.


946
01:04:18.168 --> 01:04:21.034
Good. You got 24 hours to get me
something and you can keep your job.


947
01:04:21.035 --> 01:04:22.667
No shit? My job that doesn't pay?

948
01:04:22.668 --> 01:04:24.334
Yeah, that one, and
you're lucky to have it.


949
01:04:24.335 --> 01:04:25.400
Okay.

950
01:04:28.568 --> 01:04:30.701
You liked that one, did you?

951
01:04:30.702 --> 01:04:33.707
- Well, not...
- Mr. Osborne?


952
01:04:34.535 --> 01:04:37.532
Ben Shepard, Albany Sun Times.

953
01:04:39.468 --> 01:04:41.867
You're a long way from
Albany, Mr. Shepard.


954
01:04:41.868 --> 01:04:44.501
Yeah, well, phones don't
work so well out there.


955
01:04:44.502 --> 01:04:46.300
You're a hard man to pin down.

956
01:04:46.301 --> 01:04:48.167
Apparently not.

957
01:04:48.168 --> 01:04:51.000
Do you mind? There are proper channels.
I'm with my friends and family here.


958
01:04:51.001 --> 01:04:56.078
I'm sorry, I know it's an intrusion.
I just didn't want to disturb you at home.


959
01:04:56.835 --> 01:04:57.934
What?

960
01:04:57.935 --> 01:05:00.203
Can I speak to you, please, sir?

961
01:05:02.035 --> 01:05:04.611
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.


962
01:05:09.835 --> 01:05:12.467
Now, what is it you're here for?

963
01:05:12.468 --> 01:05:14.867
Well, sir, I was just hoping I could
ask you a couple of questions


964
01:05:14.868 --> 01:05:17.501
regarding the Bank of
Michigan investigation.


965
01:05:17.502 --> 01:05:18.967
That was a long time ago.

966
01:05:18.968 --> 01:05:20.867
But you watch the news. I'm
sure you're aware Sharon Solarz


967
01:05:20.868 --> 01:05:23.401
has been brought back to
Michigan to stand trial,


968
01:05:23.402 --> 01:05:25.367
Nick Sloan has been
identified and is on the run.


969
01:05:25.368 --> 01:05:26.934
I am aware.

970
01:05:26.935 --> 01:05:30.939
How involved was your department with
the Bank of Michigan investigation?


971
01:05:31.168 --> 01:05:33.534
This is all in the public record.

972
01:05:33.535 --> 01:05:35.701
What about before that?

973
01:05:35.702 --> 01:05:37.667
My understanding is you
covered the campus


974
01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:39.267
- when they were pretty active, right?
- Mmm-hmm.


975
01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.434
Did you ever come in contact
with Mimi Lurie or Nick Sloan


976
01:05:41.435 --> 01:05:43.734
- before they went underground?
- No.


977
01:05:43.735 --> 01:05:45.901
I... I'm sorry, what is it you're
trying to get answered?


978
01:05:45.902 --> 01:05:48.334
You know, maybe if I knew the
question, I could better help.


979
01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:51.301
Well, I'm just trying to understand
the evidence of the case.


980
01:05:51.302 --> 01:05:52.367
Mmm-hmm.

981
01:05:52.368 --> 01:05:53.867
Sharon Solarz was atelier.

982
01:05:53.868 --> 01:05:56.567
She went through the training program.
It's pretty self-explanatory.


983
01:05:56.568 --> 01:05:58.801
But when you get to the
others, that's where I get lost.


984
01:05:58.802 --> 01:06:01.234
Mimi Lurie, Nick Sloan,
Vince Dallesandro,


985
01:06:01.235 --> 01:06:03.801
that's where it starts
getting blurry for me.


986
01:06:03.802 --> 01:06:05.667
Does it?

987
01:06:05.668 --> 01:06:07.201
Dallesandro's prints
were on the gun.


988
01:06:07.202 --> 01:06:10.034
He got caught a couple of days
later on an anonymous tip.


989
01:06:10.035 --> 01:06:11.667
He testified against the others.

990
01:06:11.668 --> 01:06:13.034
He was already on parole.

991
01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:15.634
And ended up dying in prison,
or getting killed or killing himself,


992
01:06:15.635 --> 01:06:16.801
depending on whose
report you believe.


993
01:06:16.802 --> 01:06:18.767
The others were all
fugitives at the time,


994
01:06:18.768 --> 01:06:22.167
already wanted by the FBI,
already underground.


995
01:06:22.168 --> 01:06:24.234
They knew how to
disappear, and they did.


996
01:06:24.235 --> 01:06:27.000
Yeah, it's just this time I think
he's doing something different.


997
01:06:27.001 --> 01:06:29.543
Why should this time be
any different than before?


998
01:06:29.635 --> 01:06:32.108
Well, this time I don't
think he's running away.


999
01:06:33.302 --> 01:06:35.367
This time I think he's
trying to clear his name.


1000
01:06:35.368 --> 01:06:39.001
Well, how do you think
he's gonna do that?


1001
01:06:39.002 --> 01:06:40.801
I was hoping you
could help me there.


1002
01:06:40.802 --> 01:06:42.805
Not sure how.

1003
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:46.334
The getaway car was his car.
His prints were all over it.


1004
01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.834
There was testimony
that he was there.


1005
01:06:48.835 --> 01:06:50.334
So?

1006
01:06:50.335 --> 01:06:52.933
What am I missing?

1007
01:06:52.935 --> 01:06:55.864
- Hi, Dad!
- Hey!


1008
01:06:56.502 --> 01:06:59.234
All right, sweetie. How are you?

1009
01:06:59.235 --> 01:07:01.615
How are you doing? I'm Ben
Shepard, Albany Sun Times.


1010
01:07:01.802 --> 01:07:03.900
My wife Marianne,
my daughter Rebecca.


1011
01:07:03.901 --> 01:07:05.701
Albany Sun Times in
Albany, New York?


1012
01:07:05.702 --> 01:07:07.567
Are you just passing
through, Mr. Shepard?


1013
01:07:07.568 --> 01:07:10.041
He's just leaving.

1014
01:07:11.502 --> 01:07:13.234
I'll be right there.

1015
01:07:13.235 --> 01:07:16.034
I'm going to be heading to, um...

1016
01:07:16.035 --> 01:07:19.367
Um... Ann Arbor for a couple of
days, and I was just wondering


1017
01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:21.867
if maybe we could sit down
for another five minutes.


1018
01:07:22.468 --> 01:07:26.034
All right. I'll be headed back to
town in a couple of days myself.


1019
01:07:26.035 --> 01:07:29.001
- Guess you got my number.
- Perfect.


1020
01:07:29.002 --> 01:07:31.578
Thank you, sir.

1021
01:07:50.035 --> 01:07:52.963
- Yeah, hello?
- How is she?


1022
01:07:53.101 --> 01:07:55.834
She's safe. She's right here.

1023
01:07:55.835 --> 01:07:59.401
Listen, Eva is afraid the
apartment's under surveillance.


1024
01:07:59.402 --> 01:08:01.739
I'm sure it is.

1025
01:08:02.134 --> 01:08:05.801
Well, we snuck out the service
entrance and came to the park,


1026
01:08:05.802 --> 01:08:09.242
and I can't guarantee
we weren't followed.


1027
01:08:09.768 --> 01:08:11.798
Can I speak to her?

1028
01:08:12.635 --> 01:08:15.335
Hold on, hold on. Izzy.

1029
01:08:22.067 --> 01:08:23.201
Where are you?

1030
01:08:23.202 --> 01:08:26.634
Honey, you don't need
to know that right now.


1031
01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:29.666
But why can't you just tell me?

1032
01:08:29.802 --> 01:08:33.001
Izzy, all I want to
know is, are you okay?


1033
01:08:33.002 --> 01:08:35.200
Everyone is so mad at you.

1034
01:08:35.201 --> 01:08:38.601
- How about you? You mad at me?
- Where are you?


1035
01:08:38.602 --> 01:08:41.400
I'm trying to get back
to you as soon as I can.


1036
01:08:41.401 --> 01:08:44.701
Got him. Just off I-94,
near Gurnee, Illinois.


1037
01:08:44.702 --> 01:08:46.634
Send the coordinates to the field.

1038
01:08:46.635 --> 01:08:49.062
- I know, but it won't be long.
- Done.


1039
01:08:51.402 --> 01:08:53.977
You have a full green light.

1040
01:08:54.335 --> 01:08:57.001
- Still tracking?
- Yup.


1041
01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:58.133
He's cooked.

1042
01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.334
Okay, send Bravo Team down.

1043
01:09:00.335 --> 01:09:03.066
- Did you kill that man?
- Did I...


1044
01:09:03.067 --> 01:09:06.367
- Kill him? That man at the bank?
- Of course not.


1045
01:09:06.368 --> 01:09:07.801
Then why did you have to leave?

1046
01:09:07.802 --> 01:09:11.667
Honey, one day soon you're gonna
understand everything, I promise.


1047
01:09:11.668 --> 01:09:16.974
I don't want you to grow up and look back
on what I did and feel bad, ever, okay?


1048
01:09:17.268 --> 01:09:20.043
But now you're gonna
have to help me.


1049
01:09:20.046 --> 01:09:21.746
You got to be strong.

1050
01:09:21.968 --> 01:09:27.308
And then next time, you and I will
go somewhere together, all right?


1051
01:09:27.535 --> 01:09:29.667
Anywhere you like.

1052
01:09:29.668 --> 01:09:32.300
Home would be fine.

1053
01:09:35.835 --> 01:09:40.067
I gotta go. I love you.

1054
01:09:40.068 --> 01:09:42.973
You do know that, right?

1055
01:10:42.502 --> 01:10:44.748
- Hi.
- Hey.


1056
01:10:44.802 --> 01:10:47.343
- How was class?
- Long.


1057
01:10:48.902 --> 01:10:50.897
Thanks.

1058
01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.627
Hey. Hi.

1059
01:10:58.702 --> 01:11:00.468
Ben Shepard. We met on the stairs.

1060
01:11:00.469 --> 01:11:03.340
Oh, right. Yeah, I remember.

1061
01:11:03.935 --> 01:11:06.294
You don't look much
like your parents.


1062
01:11:06.802 --> 01:11:09.534
- I was adopted, so, no.
- Hmm.


1063
01:11:09.535 --> 01:11:11.301
If that was your pick-up
line, it needs work.


1064
01:11:11.302 --> 01:11:13.201
- You mind if I sit?
- I'm on a date.


1065
01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.567
- Oh, you're on a date?
- Yeah.


1066
01:11:14.568 --> 01:11:17.301
Yeah, like that thing
real people do.


1067
01:11:17.302 --> 01:11:19.900
Yes, that.

1068
01:11:20.269 --> 01:11:22.601
Given your manners,
I am really surprised


1069
01:11:22.602 --> 01:11:24.334
my dad doesn't want to
spend more time with you.


1070
01:11:24.335 --> 01:11:26.067
What? What are you talking about?
Me and your dad are good.


1071
01:11:26.068 --> 01:11:28.906
We're playing poker tonight,
taking in a Pistons game tomorrow.


1072
01:11:29.902 --> 01:11:31.931
- Fun.
- Mmm.


1073
01:11:35.835 --> 01:11:38.066
Can I take you to dinner?

1074
01:11:38.067 --> 01:11:39.334
Excuse me?

1075
01:11:39.335 --> 01:11:41.133
Right, no, you're right.

1076
01:11:41.134 --> 01:11:43.133
Coffee then. What do you think?

1077
01:11:43.134 --> 01:11:46.467
I think that my date is on his
way back and you should leave.


1078
01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:48.967
Not until we figure this out.
Coffee or dinner?


1079
01:11:48.968 --> 01:11:51.934
- Persistent.
- Professional hazard.


1080
01:11:51.935 --> 01:11:53.434
- Coffee...
- Coffee, if you leave right now.


1081
01:11:53.435 --> 01:11:55.567
Okay, fine. Deal. Time, place.

1082
01:11:55.568 --> 01:11:57.734
- The cafe at the Union. 2:30.
- Okay.


1083
01:11:57.735 --> 01:12:00.067
You know, this guy's
not right for you.


1084
01:12:00.068 --> 01:12:02.131
Says you.

1085
01:12:04.568 --> 01:12:06.927
Who was that?

1086
01:12:07.402 --> 01:12:09.473
A friend of my dad's.

1087
01:12:12.002 --> 01:12:15.567
"Chance," someone once
said, don't remember who,


1088
01:12:15.568 --> 01:12:19.076
"Chance is a nickname
for providence."


1089
01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:24.133
Okay? Well, which is another way of
saying that all history is inevitable


1090
01:12:24.134 --> 01:12:27.367
because it goes to the
trouble of happening.


1091
01:12:27.368 --> 01:12:32.168
Another point of view says that history
is independent of individual will,


1092
01:12:32.169 --> 01:12:35.501
determined by social conditions
and relations of production.


1093
01:12:35.502 --> 01:12:39.802
"Relations of production." We
remember that. There he is, Karl Marx.


1094
01:12:39.803 --> 01:12:45.667
Now these theories propose
a history immune to effort,


1095
01:12:45.668 --> 01:12:49.267
removed from the choices
of everyday life.


1096
01:12:50.035 --> 01:12:55.334
But history is made
by human beings,


1097
01:12:55.335 --> 01:12:58.734
and action and passion.

1098
01:12:58.735 --> 01:13:04.734
No less than fate or economics
are its essential ingredients.


1099
01:13:04.868 --> 01:13:07.234
Go. Go, go, go.

1100
01:13:07.235 --> 01:13:12.367
But come back tomorrow because
we'll be discussing Fanon.


1101
01:13:23.502 --> 01:13:24.701
Enjoyed your lecture.

1102
01:13:24.702 --> 01:13:26.267
Thank you.

1103
01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:27.601
"Action and passion."

1104
01:13:27.602 --> 01:13:30.894
Sounds like something a
friend of mine used to say.


1105
01:13:32.668 --> 01:13:35.067
No. No, no, no, no.

1106
01:13:35.068 --> 01:13:36.401
Need to talk to you, Big J.

1107
01:13:36.402 --> 01:13:38.580
Go to hell.

1108
01:13:39.802 --> 01:13:41.434
How dare you show up here?

1109
01:13:41.435 --> 01:13:43.066
Where else could I go?

1110
01:13:43.067 --> 01:13:45.234
You're taking a hell of a chance.

1111
01:13:45.235 --> 01:13:46.834
Not by choice.

1112
01:13:46.835 --> 01:13:50.634
They're probably watching me.
Unlike you, they know who I am.


1113
01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:55.699
- Hmm. How's that working out, though?
- Fuck you. I have a life.


1114
01:13:56.568 --> 01:14:00.468
I was hoping for a little bit more,
"Hey, Nick, old friend. How are you?


1115
01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:02.834
"How have you been these
past 30-odd years?"


1116
01:14:02.835 --> 01:14:05.501
For Christ's sake, Nick.
I'm a public figure.


1117
01:14:05.502 --> 01:14:07.367
Do you know the position
you're putting me in here?


1118
01:14:07.368 --> 01:14:10.367
Nancy would forgive me banging a
freshman sooner than talking to you.


1119
01:14:10.368 --> 01:14:12.201
You're still with Nan?

1120
01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:16.301
- Yeah, some of us made it work.
- Yeah, some of you got lucky.


1121
01:14:16.302 --> 01:14:19.234
- It wasn't luck.
- Well, what was it then?


1122
01:14:19.235 --> 01:14:22.767
Jed, what was it?

1123
01:14:23.635 --> 01:14:26.028
We didn't kill anybody.

1124
01:14:26.835 --> 01:14:28.534
Jed, I need to find Mimi.

1125
01:14:28.535 --> 01:14:31.467
Looking for a girl? They got
websites for that sort of thing.


1126
01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:34.795
What makes you think
I know where she is?


1127
01:14:36.067 --> 01:14:38.313
Donal told you.

1128
01:14:38.735 --> 01:14:41.534
Fuck. Fuck.

1129
01:14:41.535 --> 01:14:45.214
Does it matter?
Jed, does it matter?


1130
01:14:46.235 --> 01:14:48.367
Look, the truth?
I haven't talked to Mimi


1131
01:14:48.368 --> 01:14:51.034
since bellbottoms went
out of style, okay?


1132
01:14:51.035 --> 01:14:52.968
I mean, how do you know
she's even still alive?


1133
01:14:52.969 --> 01:14:54.401
I don't.

1134
01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:57.367
Why would I help you after all these
years? We didn't even agree back then.


1135
01:14:57.368 --> 01:15:01.234
Because Mimi's the only person who
can help me get my daughter back.


1136
01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:04.872
- You got a daughter?
- Yes.


1137
01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:08.865
No shit.

1138
01:15:41.369 --> 01:15:43.944
Mimi Lurie.

1139
01:15:46.902 --> 01:15:49.295
Henry Osborne.

1140
01:15:58.368 --> 01:16:01.159
That doesn't make sense.

1141
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:20.335
Where are you going?

1142
01:16:31.702 --> 01:16:34.034
Let's go. You can walk me to class.

1143
01:16:34.035 --> 01:16:36.371
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.


1144
01:16:36.635 --> 01:16:40.100
- So, tell me about yourself.
- Peace Corps for a bit.


1145
01:16:40.101 --> 01:16:41.234
Hmm.

1146
01:16:41.235 --> 01:16:43.601
Thought I was gonna
change the world,


1147
01:16:43.602 --> 01:16:46.468
decided it was actually people
who needed changing.


1148
01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:47.534
Hmm.

1149
01:16:47.535 --> 01:16:49.868
Went back to school
to study psychology.


1150
01:16:49.869 --> 01:16:52.201
Turns out psychology has
nothing to do with that.


1151
01:16:53.269 --> 01:16:56.299
Ended up in New York for a bit.

1152
01:16:56.868 --> 01:16:59.867
I guess I thought I was
gonna change myself.


1153
01:16:59.868 --> 01:17:01.967
Turns out I'm too stubborn.

1154
01:17:01.968 --> 01:17:05.112
You must be older than I thought.

1155
01:17:06.568 --> 01:17:10.568
So what happens now? If in
doubt, you go back to law school?


1156
01:17:10.569 --> 01:17:14.441
I'm not in doubt.
It's my mom. She's a judge.


1157
01:17:14.802 --> 01:17:16.167
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.


1158
01:17:16.168 --> 01:17:18.345
So is mine!

1159
01:17:18.402 --> 01:17:20.701
Just not professionally.

1160
01:17:23.102 --> 01:17:25.065
Okay.

1161
01:17:26.235 --> 01:17:28.709
You like Michigan?

1162
01:17:28.735 --> 01:17:30.878
I love it.

1163
01:17:31.435 --> 01:17:33.201
Okay, you.

1164
01:17:33.202 --> 01:17:35.201
I read one of your articles
online last night.


1165
01:17:35.202 --> 01:17:36.734
I read a couple of them, actually.

1166
01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:38.434
- You're kidding me. Really?
- Yeah.


1167
01:17:38.435 --> 01:17:41.133
And what did you think?

1168
01:17:41.134 --> 01:17:44.440
- I think you broke a big story.
- I did.


1169
01:17:44.802 --> 01:17:46.834
I think you're clinging
to it like a life raft.


1170
01:17:46.835 --> 01:17:48.067
Oh, wow.

1171
01:17:48.068 --> 01:17:49.867
- Now it defines you.
- Wow.


1172
01:17:49.868 --> 01:17:50.967
Yeah, I do.

1173
01:17:50.968 --> 01:17:53.873
Maybe psych's not
a bad fit after all.


1174
01:17:54.702 --> 01:17:57.167
I kind of call
'em like I see 'em.

1175
01:17:57.168 --> 01:18:01.063
Fair enough. Call this one.
Your father's ignoring me. Why?


1176
01:18:01.202 --> 01:18:05.006
I'm guessing because he
doesn't want to talk to you.


1177
01:18:05.235 --> 01:18:07.105
Hmm.

1178
01:18:07.134 --> 01:18:09.437
He's retired.

1179
01:18:09.802 --> 01:18:11.467
I mean... And this was decades ago.

1180
01:18:11.468 --> 01:18:16.239
He wants to fish and watch
boats on the water.


1181
01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:20.517
He's also not one for reminiscing.

1182
01:18:21.802 --> 01:18:25.094
You know he was close
to the Lurie family?


1183
01:18:25.335 --> 01:18:27.168
- Yeah.
- Mmm.


1184
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:31.816
Her dad and my granddad
were fishing buddies, I think.


1185
01:18:32.935 --> 01:18:34.467
- That's what I heard.
- Yeah.


1186
01:18:34.468 --> 01:18:37.133
They used to go up to the
Linder Woods in the UP.


1187
01:18:37.134 --> 01:18:39.234
It's absolutely gorgeous up there.

1188
01:18:39.235 --> 01:18:40.568
You would hate it.

1189
01:18:40.569 --> 01:18:41.934
The UP?

1190
01:18:41.935 --> 01:18:43.334
The Upper Peninsula.

1191
01:18:43.335 --> 01:18:46.742
Oh. He told me he never met her.

1192
01:18:48.802 --> 01:18:50.673
Huh.

1193
01:18:52.802 --> 01:18:56.634
That had to be hard, to live with the
Lurie name after everything went down.


1194
01:18:56.635 --> 01:18:59.837
Yeah. I'm sure it was.

1195
01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:03.034
Did he ever talk about her
when you were younger?


1196
01:19:03.035 --> 01:19:06.111
This was all way before my time.

1197
01:19:13.067 --> 01:19:14.601
What are you thinking?

1198
01:19:18.035 --> 01:19:20.234
Can I speak honestly
with you for a second?


1199
01:19:20.235 --> 01:19:22.139
Yeah.

1200
01:19:22.635 --> 01:19:24.501
People lie for two reasons.

1201
01:19:24.502 --> 01:19:28.501
They speak unknowingly, a simple mistake,
you know, or they do it intentionally.


1202
01:19:28.502 --> 01:19:30.701
And having met a known fugitive
who is also a family friend


1203
01:19:30.702 --> 01:19:33.701
- isn't something you would forget.
- Mmm. What are you getting at?


1204
01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:37.667
In my business, when someone lies
intentionally, that's significant.


1205
01:19:37.668 --> 01:19:38.901
It seems your father lied to me.

1206
01:19:38.902 --> 01:19:41.501
I'm guessing 'cause it's
some way to cover himself.


1207
01:19:41.502 --> 01:19:46.634
Look, Ben, I get that you're good
at your job, but so is my dad,


1208
01:19:46.635 --> 01:19:50.634
and I would put the quality of his
character up against anyone in the world.


1209
01:19:50.635 --> 01:19:52.668
So if you're insinuating
that he was


1210
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:56.501
or is somehow involved in something
that ends up in your paper,


1211
01:19:56.502 --> 01:19:59.734
I would be damn sure you know
what you're talking about.


1212
01:19:59.735 --> 01:20:02.067
I may be a student of
the law, but that's libel,


1213
01:20:02.068 --> 01:20:05.270
and in my business,
that's significant.


1214
01:20:09.668 --> 01:20:12.334
I'd like to see you again.

1215
01:20:16.968 --> 01:20:18.872
Bye.

1216
01:20:31.702 --> 01:20:34.813
Every sixth and seventh number.

1217
01:20:34.969 --> 01:20:38.546
- How do I know who I'm calling?
- You don't.


1218
01:20:39.635 --> 01:20:42.142
- Okay.
- Good luck.


1219
01:21:02.902 --> 01:21:04.534
Yeah?

1220
01:21:04.535 --> 01:21:09.181
Hi, this is, uh, John Smith.
I'm looking for a plumber.


1221
01:21:10.435 --> 01:21:13.226
- Are you now?
- Yes, I am.


1222
01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:17.567
Wow. It's been a long time
since I've heard that.


1223
01:21:17.568 --> 01:21:19.067
Is this line clean?

1224
01:21:19.068 --> 01:21:21.034
Babe, they didn't
listen to me back then,


1225
01:21:21.035 --> 01:21:23.401
and they sure ain't
listening to me now.


1226
01:21:23.402 --> 01:21:26.193
- Who's calling?
- Nick Sloan.


1227
01:21:27.302 --> 01:21:31.901
Nick Sloan? God,
I just saw you on TV.


1228
01:21:31.902 --> 01:21:34.868
Unless you want to see yourself
there, too, we better hurry.


1229
01:21:34.869 --> 01:21:37.616
I need to get to Mimi Lurie.

1230
01:21:39.002 --> 01:21:40.334
Where are you?

1231
01:21:40.335 --> 01:21:44.470
845-555-8249.

1232
01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:49.582
Okay. Let's see if we
still got the juice.


1233
01:21:49.702 --> 01:21:51.983
Hang tight, brother.

1234
01:22:03.702 --> 01:22:06.167
You want to hear something funny?

1235
01:22:06.168 --> 01:22:08.901
I've been Jim Grant
longer than I've been me.


1236
01:22:08.902 --> 01:22:10.977
That's nice.

1237
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:15.167
Come on, Jed. We're
just talking here.


1238
01:22:15.168 --> 01:22:17.835
We don't need to talk.

1239
01:22:17.902 --> 01:22:20.634
I think we do. You're angry.

1240
01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:22.607
Damn right I am.

1241
01:22:23.068 --> 01:22:27.168
Jesus. 30 years on and still
holding a grudge, huh?


1242
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:28.993
No.

1243
01:22:30.134 --> 01:22:32.501
It was the lack of respect.

1244
01:22:32.502 --> 01:22:34.301
You guys put everybody in danger.

1245
01:22:34.302 --> 01:22:36.501
We didn't kill anybody.
We didn't hurt anyone.


1246
01:22:36.502 --> 01:22:39.568
We were a peace movement,
for Christ's sake.


1247
01:22:40.569 --> 01:22:43.440
People make mistakes, Jed.

1248
01:22:45.134 --> 01:22:47.934
Then you turn yourself in and
atone for what you've done,


1249
01:22:47.935 --> 01:22:51.774
and then you keep up the struggle
in any small way you can.


1250
01:22:51.869 --> 01:22:54.834
You like what you're doing now?

1251
01:22:54.835 --> 01:22:57.634
Yeah. Yeah.

1252
01:22:57.635 --> 01:23:01.041
I like what I try to do.
I like my students.


1253
01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:03.401
Seems like it's mutual.

1254
01:23:03.402 --> 01:23:05.201
Yeah.

1255
01:23:05.202 --> 01:23:10.401
Yeah, I can still pack the
hall when I... talk about SDS.


1256
01:23:12.302 --> 01:23:15.234
The March on Washington,
trying to change the world.


1257
01:23:15.235 --> 01:23:17.968
They're drawn to it,
I can tell. I...


1258
01:23:17.969 --> 01:23:20.001
They just don't know
what to do with it.


1259
01:23:20.002 --> 01:23:23.807
I don't know why they would.
It's ancient history to them.


1260
01:23:23.968 --> 01:23:26.534
So they listen and clap,
and then they update


1261
01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:29.001
their Facebook statuses
and they forget all about it.


1262
01:23:29.002 --> 01:23:30.601
We've turned into our parents, Jed.

1263
01:23:30.602 --> 01:23:32.634
Yeah. Huh!

1264
01:23:32.635 --> 01:23:36.109
Now we're just a
story told to children.


1265
01:23:36.868 --> 01:23:40.834
Well, I'm glad someone's
still telling it.


1266
01:23:46.168 --> 01:23:47.601
Yeah?

1267
01:23:47.602 --> 01:23:49.734
Are you the guy that
needs a plumber?


1268
01:23:49.735 --> 01:23:52.601
I am. The line clean?

1269
01:23:52.602 --> 01:23:54.334
Thirty seconds to be safe.

1270
01:23:54.335 --> 01:23:56.334
- Mimi?
- Was here, yeah.


1271
01:23:56.335 --> 01:23:58.763
- "Here"?
- Big Sur.


1272
01:23:58.869 --> 01:24:01.616
- "Was"?
- Left yesterday.


1273
01:24:01.702 --> 01:24:02.801
Say where going?

1274
01:24:02.802 --> 01:24:04.468
North.

1275
01:24:04.469 --> 01:24:06.034
By boat?

1276
01:24:06.035 --> 01:24:08.901
Would have made more sense,
but she was heading inland.


1277
01:24:08.902 --> 01:24:11.375
- Got it.
- Good luck.


1278
01:24:12.468 --> 01:24:14.258
She gone?

1279
01:24:14.502 --> 01:24:16.406
Yeah.

1280
01:24:16.569 --> 01:24:19.498
But I know where she's headed.

1281
01:24:19.735 --> 01:24:23.300
Hey, thanks for everything.

1282
01:24:23.402 --> 01:24:27.867
You really want to thank me, Nick,
you'll never contact me again.


1283
01:25:03.134 --> 01:25:04.667
Everything we have on the reporter.

1284
01:25:04.668 --> 01:25:06.201
He's been in Michigan for two days.

1285
01:25:06.202 --> 01:25:08.967
Background on people he's contacted
and places he's visited.


1286
01:25:08.968 --> 01:25:10.034
Stay on it.

1287
01:25:10.035 --> 01:25:12.394
Of course, sir. Travel safe.

1288
01:25:28.568 --> 01:25:31.314
Can I see some ID, please?

1289
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:35.109
All right. Thank you, Mr.
Haywood. Have a good day.


1290
01:25:45.035 --> 01:25:47.801
I'm looking for real estate
records and plat maps


1291
01:25:47.802 --> 01:25:50.567
for the Lurie family,
Linder-Lurie Lumber


1292
01:25:50.568 --> 01:25:54.099
and Linder Holdings,
going back 50 years.


1293
01:25:55.035 --> 01:25:56.905
Those three.

1294
01:26:00.702 --> 01:26:03.095
Agent Cornelius.

1295
01:26:04.668 --> 01:26:06.936
Right this way.

1296
01:26:17.635 --> 01:26:19.501
So where are the Linder Woods?

1297
01:26:19.502 --> 01:26:21.839
I have no idea.

1298
01:26:22.235 --> 01:26:24.734
What about Drummond Island?

1299
01:26:24.735 --> 01:26:28.066
Well, it's up here, right
across the water from Canada.


1300
01:26:28.067 --> 01:26:30.568
And this white part, this
is private property, right?


1301
01:26:30.569 --> 01:26:31.668
Beats me.

1302
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:34.133
But, I mean,
it's not part of that...


1303
01:26:34.134 --> 01:26:37.534
That conservancy or that
preserve or whatever that is?


1304
01:26:37.535 --> 01:26:39.534
Doesn't look like it.

1305
01:26:39.535 --> 01:26:43.942
I don't see any sales or
state seizure reports.


1306
01:26:44.235 --> 01:26:48.034
But if this is privately owned, somebody
is still paying taxes on this, right?


1307
01:26:48.035 --> 01:26:50.509
I don't know.

1308
01:26:50.535 --> 01:26:53.167
- Can I have copies of all this?
- Sure.


1309
01:27:25.968 --> 01:27:28.201
I'm standing outside the
Ann Arbor Courthouse,


1310
01:27:28.202 --> 01:27:31.501
where Sharon Solarz entered
a plea of not guilty.


1311
01:27:31.502 --> 01:27:33.401
Judge Panameno remanded
her without bail.


1312
01:27:33.402 --> 01:27:35.334
- Mr. Osborne, can I speak to you?
- Not now.


1313
01:27:35.335 --> 01:27:39.344
Not talking to me is a very dangerous
decision for you right now.


1314
01:27:42.568 --> 01:27:44.301
Not here. I'll call you.

1315
01:27:44.302 --> 01:27:47.566
- Look, if I don't hear from you soon...
- You will.


1316
01:29:53.602 --> 01:29:57.771
Don't bother cleaning up.
We won't be here that long.


1317
01:30:05.101 --> 01:30:07.165
You came.

1318
01:30:16.402 --> 01:30:18.034
You look older.

1319
01:30:21.002 --> 01:30:22.834
You look the same.

1320
01:30:22.835 --> 01:30:25.046
Yeah, right.

1321
01:30:30.169 --> 01:30:32.201
Mi, we gotta talk.

1322
01:30:32.202 --> 01:30:34.231
So talk.

1323
01:30:34.668 --> 01:30:36.667
Come on, Mimi, is this the
way you're gonna play it?


1324
01:30:36.668 --> 01:30:39.401
Like we don't know each other?
Like I'm just some adversary?


1325
01:30:39.402 --> 01:30:40.467
Aren't you?

1326
01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:41.534
Don't.

1327
01:30:41.535 --> 01:30:45.301
Okay, so why am I here?
Why did you smoke me out?


1328
01:30:45.302 --> 01:30:46.434
Smoke you out?

1329
01:30:46.435 --> 01:30:48.133
You went to Donal.

1330
01:30:48.134 --> 01:30:49.201
I had to.

1331
01:30:49.202 --> 01:30:52.472
Well, I got the message. I'm here.

1332
01:30:53.768 --> 01:30:56.601
Nick, I can't help you.
That's why I'm here.


1333
01:30:56.602 --> 01:31:00.475
I came to tell you.
I figured I owed you that.


1334
01:31:05.235 --> 01:31:07.298
Hmm.

1335
01:31:09.235 --> 01:31:12.963
- I have a daughter.
- I know.


1336
01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:15.472
She's almost 12.

1337
01:31:20.935 --> 01:31:23.112
That's her.

1338
01:31:27.435 --> 01:31:29.829
What's her name?

1339
01:31:30.335 --> 01:31:32.330
Isabel.

1340
01:31:32.669 --> 01:31:35.598
It's your middle name, yeah.

1341
01:31:35.968 --> 01:31:38.873
Didn't you love your wife?

1342
01:31:40.668 --> 01:31:44.634
- More than you can imagine.
- Oh, I can imagine.


1343
01:31:44.635 --> 01:31:46.001
Look, I know this child.

1344
01:31:46.002 --> 01:31:48.834
She's probably never gonna get over
what's happened to her already,


1345
01:31:48.835 --> 01:31:51.668
and she's got a whole
life ahead of her.


1346
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:55.036
- So I'm asking you just...
- You're asking me


1347
01:31:55.568 --> 01:32:01.431
to give myself up so I can clear
you for the sake of the child.


1348
01:32:02.868 --> 01:32:07.275
I see. Everything to protect
the new little family.


1349
01:32:07.502 --> 01:32:09.001
Fuck your principles?

1350
01:32:09.002 --> 01:32:12.442
Fuck anything else you
used to stand for?


1351
01:32:13.735 --> 01:32:16.801
Well, the struggle doesn't end
just because you got tired of it.


1352
01:32:16.802 --> 01:32:19.701
I didn't get tired of it.
I grew up.


1353
01:32:19.702 --> 01:32:22.534
Well, we promised each other
we weren't gonna do that.


1354
01:32:22.535 --> 01:32:24.894
Yeah, but it happened.

1355
01:32:28.835 --> 01:32:30.901
I left the movement for the
same reason I joined it,


1356
01:32:30.902 --> 01:32:35.276
because I didn't want to see good
people's lives thrown away for nothing.


1357
01:32:36.469 --> 01:32:40.364
You've waited a long time to
tell me that, haven't you?


1358
01:32:41.702 --> 01:32:45.961
And you've been a long time
coming home from the bank.


1359
01:32:49.402 --> 01:32:52.547
You were close to
Mimi Lurie's family.


1360
01:32:53.035 --> 01:32:55.901
I wouldn't say close.
My dad knew her dad.


1361
01:32:55.902 --> 01:32:57.734
Hmm.

1362
01:32:57.735 --> 01:33:00.467
You went to the same
school, same church.


1363
01:33:00.468 --> 01:33:03.339
You went on fishing trips together.

1364
01:33:03.735 --> 01:33:06.664
There's something
you're not telling me.


1365
01:33:06.969 --> 01:33:08.701
What are you driving at, Shepard?

1366
01:33:08.702 --> 01:33:11.934
You know that Nick Sloan is looking for
something or someone to clear him?


1367
01:33:11.935 --> 01:33:15.900
- I know that's your assumption.
- Could that be Mimi Lurie?


1368
01:33:17.702 --> 01:33:19.766
I'm off the record.

1369
01:33:22.469 --> 01:33:26.601
Think it out. First, he'd have to
find her, convince her to testify.


1370
01:33:26.602 --> 01:33:28.767
Second, she'd have to surrender.

1371
01:33:28.768 --> 01:33:32.312
- But it's a participant's testimony.
- That's the point.


1372
01:33:32.535 --> 01:33:35.901
If Mimi comes out of hiding and
surrenders herself to testify


1373
01:33:35.902 --> 01:33:37.567
that Nick Sloan wasn't at the bank,

1374
01:33:37.568 --> 01:33:40.401
it's what lawyers call a
declaration against interest.


1375
01:33:40.402 --> 01:33:43.168
It destroys her own
possibility of a defense.


1376
01:33:43.169 --> 01:33:45.534
- It would clear him.
- Why? Why would she do that?


1377
01:33:45.535 --> 01:33:48.234
Why would she give herself up
to a jail sentence to save him?


1378
01:33:48.235 --> 01:33:49.934
I mean, what is her motivation?

1379
01:33:49.935 --> 01:33:53.701
- You really think she's gonna do that?
- It doesn't matter what we think.


1380
01:33:53.702 --> 01:33:55.434
He obviously believes
he can convince her.


1381
01:33:55.435 --> 01:33:57.465
Why now?

1382
01:33:58.067 --> 01:34:00.905
Why not do this back then?

1383
01:34:03.469 --> 01:34:05.066
How long have you known about this?

1384
01:34:07.402 --> 01:34:10.133
I'm obviously not the only
person in this conversation


1385
01:34:10.134 --> 01:34:14.683
who knows about her ties to a piece of
property just on the outside of Canada.


1386
01:34:15.968 --> 01:34:18.868
Mr. Osborne, what's the actual charge
against a law enforcement officer


1387
01:34:18.869 --> 01:34:22.067
who fails to follow credible evidence about
the whereabouts of a known fugitive?


1388
01:34:22.068 --> 01:34:25.247
I think there'd be
a variety, actually.


1389
01:34:25.469 --> 01:34:28.875
You have information. Why
aren't you coming forward?


1390
01:34:29.235 --> 01:34:33.201
Well, you have information,
too, so what are you gonna do?


1391
01:34:33.202 --> 01:34:36.100
I'm a journalist. I'm gonna
do what I always do.


1392
01:34:36.101 --> 01:34:38.868
This information is gonna be on every
computer screen in the next 20 minutes.


1393
01:34:38.869 --> 01:34:40.801
I'm gonna find out everything
you're hiding from me,


1394
01:34:40.802 --> 01:34:44.732
and I'm gonna expose it in a
very big and very real way.


1395
01:34:45.335 --> 01:34:48.867
You're about to do a lot of
damage to a lot of people.


1396
01:34:48.869 --> 01:34:51.661
You have no idea how much.

1397
01:34:52.002 --> 01:34:54.338
I think they have it coming.

1398
01:34:54.368 --> 01:34:57.513
On that, you could
not be more wrong.


1399
01:34:57.635 --> 01:35:02.470
Innocent people are about to get swept
up in this storm you're unleashing.


1400
01:35:02.602 --> 01:35:05.526
- Trust me.
- Trust you?


1401
01:35:06.435 --> 01:35:09.401
Tell me something, Mr. Osborne, are
you one of those innocent people?


1402
01:35:09.402 --> 01:35:11.671
No, I am not.

1403
01:35:12.735 --> 01:35:15.276
But my daughter is.

1404
01:35:16.101 --> 01:35:18.097
How so?

1405
01:35:24.535 --> 01:35:30.144
I got something I need to do,
but on my own terms.


1406
01:35:54.768 --> 01:35:56.764
Upper Peninsula.

1407
01:36:05.134 --> 01:36:08.542
Beck, it's Dad.
I'm trying you again.


1408
01:36:08.735 --> 01:36:12.243
Um, sorry about the messages.

1409
01:36:12.569 --> 01:36:15.034
Uh... Listen, if you...

1410
01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:19.730
When you get a chance, I need
to talk to you to tell you, um...


1411
01:36:20.101 --> 01:36:23.098
This... This Shepard guy...

1412
01:36:25.101 --> 01:36:27.610
It's important, Beck.

1413
01:36:28.569 --> 01:36:32.248
I love you, sweetie.
Call me back, please.


1414
01:36:36.335 --> 01:36:38.234
I don't know why that's
so hard to figure out.


1415
01:36:38.235 --> 01:36:40.401
What made you think that
I was ever going to be...


1416
01:36:40.402 --> 01:36:42.267
For one thing, I didn't do it.
I wasn't there, Mimi.


1417
01:36:42.268 --> 01:36:45.100
But you should have been, then
everything would have been different.


1418
01:36:45.101 --> 01:36:48.934
Vince lost his cool completely.
You wouldn't have.


1419
01:36:48.935 --> 01:36:51.168
- Nobody would have gotten hurt.
- Somebody didn't get hurt.


1420
01:36:51.169 --> 01:36:54.801
Somebody got killed. A father,
a husband with a family.


1421
01:36:54.802 --> 01:36:57.701
Do you think I didn't think about that
when so many fathers with families


1422
01:36:57.702 --> 01:37:00.669
- were being killed and still are?
- You shouldn't have gone, Mimi.


1423
01:37:00.670 --> 01:37:03.001
You should have said no.

1424
01:37:04.134 --> 01:37:06.667
- We were done.
- No, you were done.


1425
01:37:06.668 --> 01:37:09.234
I never was, but you
couldn't accept that.


1426
01:37:09.235 --> 01:37:10.968
Mimi...

1427
01:37:11.369 --> 01:37:15.378
You fooled yourself into
thinking I was someone else,


1428
01:37:15.402 --> 01:37:17.768
and you're still doing it.

1429
01:37:17.769 --> 01:37:20.401
I'm not the one fooling
myself. It was over.


1430
01:37:20.402 --> 01:37:24.445
It wasn't over.
It's still not over.


1431
01:37:24.602 --> 01:37:26.867
Every single thing we
said then is true today,


1432
01:37:26.868 --> 01:37:29.401
and every single day
it's getting worse.


1433
01:37:29.402 --> 01:37:33.144
- That's not the point.
- Oh, it's exactly the point, Nick.


1434
01:37:33.768 --> 01:37:37.682
I won't give myself up
to a system I despise.


1435
01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:40.468
I won't give up my freedom
and accept their version


1436
01:37:40.469 --> 01:37:44.100
- of what life is supposed to be.
- Mimi, how free are you? Really?


1437
01:37:44.101 --> 01:37:46.347
Well, I'm not in jail.

1438
01:37:46.535 --> 01:37:48.768
I don't expect you to understand.

1439
01:37:48.769 --> 01:37:51.201
- They have you, Nick.
- Oh, like hell.


1440
01:37:51.202 --> 01:37:55.267
The system that protects the super-rich
and the super-super-super-rich


1441
01:37:55.268 --> 01:37:57.767
and fucks over everyone
else and the planet to boot.


1442
01:37:57.768 --> 01:38:00.067
Mimi. Mimi, would you just stop?

1443
01:38:00.068 --> 01:38:02.434
Everyone who's given
up and given in,


1444
01:38:02.435 --> 01:38:07.663
they're living at the expense of what
they once believed. It's so sad.


1445
01:38:07.935 --> 01:38:11.301
You understood this.
I'm sorry you've forgotten.


1446
01:38:11.302 --> 01:38:15.601
I wish I had forgotten, because my
problem is I can't stop remembering.


1447
01:38:15.602 --> 01:38:18.467
So if you've built a wall so
high, more power to you.


1448
01:38:18.468 --> 01:38:22.220
- You're stronger than I am.
- I will turn myself in...


1449
01:38:22.221 --> 01:38:27.601
the day the politicians and corporations
turn themselves in for all they've done.


1450
01:38:27.602 --> 01:38:31.100
That's the day I'll hand myself
in, Scout's fucking honor.


1451
01:38:31.101 --> 01:38:33.133
Stop hiding behind your
fucking revolutionary rant.


1452
01:38:33.134 --> 01:38:36.067
- Oh, don't turn it on me.
- You know what I see?


1453
01:38:36.068 --> 01:38:39.998
I see the same person.
I see it, kid.


1454
01:38:40.735 --> 01:38:43.367
I see it in your eyes.

1455
01:38:44.602 --> 01:38:49.572
You can hide from everyone else in the world
and be somebody else, but not with me.


1456
01:38:50.035 --> 01:38:53.334
What are your memories, Mi?
The ones you can't run away from?


1457
01:38:53.335 --> 01:38:55.125
Hey!

1458
01:38:57.067 --> 01:39:00.100
We had a responsibility
beyond the cause.


1459
01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:02.199
We had a baby.

1460
01:39:07.235 --> 01:39:10.948
And we were so consumed
by our principles


1461
01:39:11.535 --> 01:39:14.133
that we abandoned our
most fundamental duty.


1462
01:39:19.468 --> 01:39:22.396
We were doing our duty, Nick.

1463
01:39:22.602 --> 01:39:25.467
We made a plan that if
anything ever went wrong...


1464
01:39:25.468 --> 01:39:26.734
We never should have
carried out that plan.


1465
01:39:26.735 --> 01:39:29.968
...we knew exactly what we
had to do. We both agreed...


1466
01:39:29.969 --> 01:39:31.634
We were wrong.

1467
01:39:31.635 --> 01:39:32.701
We had no choice.

1468
01:39:32.702 --> 01:39:35.937
So we should have known it.
We were wrong.


1469
01:39:37.602 --> 01:39:42.430
We both accepted it, and
we've both had to live with it.


1470
01:40:24.535 --> 01:40:27.008
It wasn't a dream.

1471
01:40:28.235 --> 01:40:34.337
It was a possibility we
could have made a reality.


1472
01:40:35.535 --> 01:40:38.870
- We could make them stop.
- Yeah.


1473
01:40:40.202 --> 01:40:43.039
Yeah, we could change things

1474
01:40:44.035 --> 01:40:46.997
if we could make a difference.

1475
01:40:47.969 --> 01:40:51.204
I still believe in
that possibility.


1476
01:41:03.402 --> 01:41:06.182
Is that all you believe?

1477
01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:17.768
Can you put me through
to Ben Shepard, please?


1478
01:41:19.302 --> 01:41:21.034
Ah, shit.

1479
01:41:21.035 --> 01:41:22.801
Rebecca?

1480
01:41:22.802 --> 01:41:25.834
What did you say to my dad?
He sounds really upset.


1481
01:41:25.835 --> 01:41:27.034
What do you mean?

1482
01:41:27.035 --> 01:41:28.901
He left me a dozen voice
messages last night.


1483
01:41:28.902 --> 01:41:31.170
He said it had to do with you.

1484
01:41:31.469 --> 01:41:33.896
What is going on?

1485
01:41:34.368 --> 01:41:37.843
You're gonna have to
talk to your father.


1486
01:41:50.235 --> 01:41:52.572
You're up.

1487
01:41:53.535 --> 01:41:55.801
Remember when these
trees were so small


1488
01:41:55.802 --> 01:41:59.208
you could see clear
across the water?


1489
01:42:04.101 --> 01:42:06.370
I saw her.

1490
01:42:08.535 --> 01:42:10.565
What?

1491
01:42:14.702 --> 01:42:17.880
I went into Ann Arbor on my way.

1492
01:42:18.435 --> 01:42:24.435
I didn't want to. I just
couldn't help myself.


1493
01:42:27.568 --> 01:42:32.373
I sat in my car like
some kind of stalker.


1494
01:42:33.369 --> 01:42:35.341
Mim...

1495
01:42:39.935 --> 01:42:42.727
She's really something, Nicky.

1496
01:42:44.935 --> 01:42:46.907
Truly.

1497
01:42:51.935 --> 01:42:54.634
We always intended
to tell you the truth.


1498
01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:56.937
You always intended?

1499
01:42:58.268 --> 01:43:00.234
At the time we felt...

1500
01:43:00.235 --> 01:43:03.379
We hoped that nobody
needed to know.


1501
01:43:04.969 --> 01:43:08.170
I never asked about
my birth parents.


1502
01:43:08.369 --> 01:43:10.301
I really never needed to know.

1503
01:43:10.302 --> 01:43:14.710
We know. There's no
way to make this easier.


1504
01:43:15.134 --> 01:43:18.268
We redid your identity,
papered a legal adoption.


1505
01:43:18.269 --> 01:43:21.106
None of that matters to me.

1506
01:43:22.202 --> 01:43:24.634
Did you think I couldn't handle it?

1507
01:43:24.635 --> 01:43:26.501
Sweetie, we gotta
talk through this.


1508
01:43:31.435 --> 01:43:34.135
No one's perfect, Beck.

1509
01:43:35.134 --> 01:43:37.312
I love you.

1510
01:43:41.002 --> 01:43:43.239
I love you, too.

1511
01:44:07.968 --> 01:44:11.374
I can't do what you
want me to do, Nicky.


1512
01:44:11.435 --> 01:44:13.430
I know.

1513
01:44:14.802 --> 01:44:18.276
I guess I was hoping you would
become the person who could.


1514
01:44:23.068 --> 01:44:25.166
So it goes.

1515
01:44:48.035 --> 01:44:50.534
Sir, the local canine
units are on the way.


1516
01:44:50.535 --> 01:44:52.713
Roger that.

1517
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:59.141
Hello?

1518
01:45:01.735 --> 01:45:03.640
I'm here alone.

1519
01:45:05.635 --> 01:45:07.540
Hello?

1520
01:45:09.134 --> 01:45:11.367
You? Oh, sh...

1521
01:45:11.368 --> 01:45:14.479
You expect to see somebody else?

1522
01:45:15.835 --> 01:45:18.667
- Is she here?
- Who are we talking about?


1523
01:45:18.668 --> 01:45:21.367
"Who are we talking
about?" Mimi Lurie.


1524
01:45:21.368 --> 01:45:23.634
- That's who you came to see, right?
- Huh?


1525
01:45:23.635 --> 01:45:25.534
Mimi Lurie. That's who you
came to see, correct?


1526
01:45:25.535 --> 01:45:28.100
- Why would I do that?
- She could testify you weren't at the bank.


1527
01:45:28.101 --> 01:45:30.973
Almost sounds like a
news story, doesn't it?


1528
01:45:31.302 --> 01:45:35.767
- Unfortunately, I need a source.
- Really? Must be a new policy.


1529
01:45:35.768 --> 01:45:39.367
- Is she here, Nick?
- She never was.


1530
01:45:44.035 --> 01:45:46.543
- You call them?
- No.


1531
01:45:50.469 --> 01:45:55.133
Well, you got yourself a story, kid.
Congratulations. Hope you're satisfied.


1532
01:45:55.134 --> 01:45:57.201
I don't want to see a guy go
to jail for the rest of his life


1533
01:45:57.202 --> 01:45:58.301
for something he didn't do.

1534
01:45:58.302 --> 01:46:00.668
Is that what passes for
idealism these days?


1535
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:02.968
Is Mimi going to surrender?

1536
01:46:02.969 --> 01:46:05.634
- No.
- No? So, where are you going?


1537
01:46:05.635 --> 01:46:08.301
Well, before she cannot surrender,
she has to first not get caught.


1538
01:46:08.302 --> 01:46:10.667
I don't understand.
There was an easier way.


1539
01:46:10.668 --> 01:46:14.995
There usually is.
You'll learn that lesson.


1540
01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:18.345
You know, I met your daughter.

1541
01:46:21.535 --> 01:46:24.110
Your older daughter.

1542
01:46:25.535 --> 01:46:28.498
Then you really do have
yourself a story, don't you?


1543
01:46:28.768 --> 01:46:31.468
I'm guessing you didn't just
stumble into this information.


1544
01:46:31.469 --> 01:46:37.127
By my count, there are exactly four people
on the planet that knew about this.


1545
01:46:39.002 --> 01:46:41.634
You get let in on
something like this, Ben,


1546
01:46:41.635 --> 01:46:44.234
you get answers, but not
the ones you think.


1547
01:46:44.235 --> 01:46:46.701
Secrets are dangerous things, Ben.

1548
01:46:46.702 --> 01:46:50.034
We all think we want to know them,
but if you've kept one to yourself,


1549
01:46:50.035 --> 01:46:51.834
you come to understand
that doing so means


1550
01:46:51.835 --> 01:46:54.801
that you may learn something
about somebody else,


1551
01:46:54.802 --> 01:46:57.980
but you also discover
something about yourself.


1552
01:46:58.769 --> 01:47:00.801
I hope you're ready for that.

1553
01:47:00.802 --> 01:47:04.367
At this point, I have
no more secrets.


1554
01:47:05.368 --> 01:47:07.363
You're a smart guy.

1555
01:47:07.468 --> 01:47:09.567
Hold on. I'm not gonna hurt you.

1556
01:47:09.568 --> 01:47:12.701
You know exactly what motivates
me and has for the last 30 years.


1557
01:47:12.702 --> 01:47:15.734
What you're gonna have to figure
out is what motivates you.


1558
01:47:15.735 --> 01:47:18.667
- I hope you like the answer.
- Hold on. Nick!


1559
01:47:18.668 --> 01:47:21.434
- Nick!
- When the FBI comes, they'll follow me.


1560
01:47:21.435 --> 01:47:24.272
They'll never know she was here.

1561
01:47:37.969 --> 01:47:40.636
There he is.

1562
01:48:47.969 --> 01:48:49.401
What's that? That's it.

1563
01:48:51.635 --> 01:48:52.880
Come on.

1564
01:48:56.636 --> 01:49:02.466
All right, we'll take up. You
guys flank around from there. Go.


1565
01:49:44.702 --> 01:49:46.675
There he is!

1566
01:49:52.101 --> 01:49:54.074
Nicholas Sloan?

1567
01:49:54.702 --> 01:50:00.440
You're under arrest for the
murder of Hugh Krosney.


1568
01:50:10.101 --> 01:50:13.212
Can't say I'm happy to see you.

1569
01:51:46.134 --> 01:51:48.901
...after an armed robbery
at a jewelry store.


1570
01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:53.434
Mimi Lurie, last remaining fugitive from
the 1980 Bank of Michigan robbery,


1571
01:51:53.435 --> 01:51:56.767
surrendered herself to authorities
today near Drummond Island, Michigan,


1572
01:51:56.768 --> 01:51:58.701
just across the water from Canada.

1573
01:51:58.702 --> 01:52:00.901
She confessed to her
role in the robbery,


1574
01:52:00.902 --> 01:52:03.001
which resulted in the
death of a guard.


1575
01:52:03.002 --> 01:52:05.635
Charges have been dropped
against Nicholas Sloan,


1576
01:52:05.636 --> 01:52:08.667
long thought to be a
co-conspirator in the robbery.


1577
01:52:08.668 --> 01:52:11.401
No comment yet from Sloan,
who is expected to be released


1578
01:52:11.402 --> 01:52:14.067
from custody as early as tomorrow.

1579
01:52:14.068 --> 01:52:16.543
In other news today...

1580
01:53:07.435 --> 01:53:10.834
Mr. Sloan, how long were you a member
of the Weather Underground, sir?


1581
01:53:10.835 --> 01:53:11.901
Mr. Sloan!

1582
01:53:17.235 --> 01:53:18.501
I have nothing to say.

1583
01:53:18.502 --> 01:53:21.974
Do you have any plans for
today, your first day free?


1584
01:53:22.735 --> 01:53:25.527
Have you talked to your
daughter yet, sir?


1585
01:53:26.602 --> 01:53:28.426
Clear a path, please.
