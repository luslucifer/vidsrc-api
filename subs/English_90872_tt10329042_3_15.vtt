00:00:02.678 --> 00:00:04.854
Gabriel Salas,
this is Sara Castillo.


2
00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:06.203
She's our victim's advocate.

3
00:00:06.247 --> 00:00:08.640
-Gabriel, pleasure.
-Sara, mucho gusto.


4
00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:11.252
The truth is,
I have never had


5
00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:13.210
a burning desire
to be a mom.


6
00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:14.820
So, you and Robin are good?

7
00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:15.995
Things are still
a little tender,


8
00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.519
but we're both trying.

9
00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:19.695
If there are any more
stupid kisses,


10
00:00:19.738 --> 00:00:21.001
we're done.

11
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:38.322
I thought
you were going to the gym.


12
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.150
Well, if I told you
I was gonna make breakfast,


13
00:00:40.194 --> 00:00:41.673
that would
ruin the surprise.


14
00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:43.675
But I was gonna
make you breakfast


15
00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.896
to thank you
for my amazing birthday.


16
00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:48.028
Baby.

17
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.683
You already thanked me
several times.


18
00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:57.733
So,
what's the special occasion?


19
00:00:57.776 --> 00:01:00.562
Can't a husband make his wife
breakfast just because?


20
00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:03.347
A veggie omelet,
spicy sausage,


21
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:05.697
and is that pecan-crusted
French toast I smell?


22
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:08.135
-You know it is.
-All my favorites on a Monday?


23
00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:10.050
I was born tonight,
but not last night.


24
00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:12.269
Robin Taylor,
come on, out with it.


25
00:01:12.313 --> 00:01:14.141
Why are you
buttering me up?


26
00:01:14.184 --> 00:01:15.229
Okay.

27
00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:18.013
I've been summoned to DC.

28
00:01:18.058 --> 00:01:20.060
They want me there Thursday.

29
00:01:20.103 --> 00:01:22.279
Before you get upset,
it's just a meeting


30
00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:24.238
with my director
to talk about my future.


31
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:27.415
I've been putting it off
for months, baby, so I gotta go.


32
00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:29.460
Hey,
why you look so worried?


33
00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:31.462
Because what if
they want you back?


34
00:01:31.506 --> 00:01:32.811
We talked about this.

35
00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:34.769
I am not moving
back to DC.


36
00:01:34.813 --> 00:01:37.512
Okay?
I love the place we're in.


37
00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:40.123
The place we worked
really hard to get back to.


38
00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:42.169
You think
I'mma give all of that up?


39
00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:44.606
The bureau's just gonna have to
either transfer me to LA


40
00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:49.263
or...
my G man days are over.


41
00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:52.092
-Okay?
-Okay.


42
00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:55.182
Let me get your toast.

43
00:01:56.357 --> 00:01:58.054
With your fine self.

44
00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:02.667
Baby, who from your family
is coming to the wedding?


45
00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:04.539
Uh, I don't know.

46
00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:07.716
-I haven't heard back yet.
-Wedding's 10 weeks away.


47
00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.413
Kinda need
to figure that out, right?


48
00:02:10.414 --> 00:02:12.068
You excited
about your seminar?


49
00:02:12.112 --> 00:02:14.723
Yeah, I think
the DNA debate should be fun,


50
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:17.291
but honestly, I'm just excited
to hang out with Luke.


51
00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.336
It'll be a chance
for us to bond, you know,


52
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.818
just a couple of dudes
out on the open road.


53
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.082
Thelma and Louise style.

54
00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:28.606
Hurdling toward
their impending death.


55
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.304
-Amy!
-What?


56
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:32.828
I'm sorry, it's just--

57
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:34.395
This class action case, is--

58
00:02:34.438 --> 00:02:36.136
Yeah,
the group of teachers protesting


59
00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:38.138
a lower court's decision,
which allowed a mandate


60
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:40.314
by Christian College to ban any
and all talk of race issues?


61
00:02:40.357 --> 00:02:42.968
See,
I listen when you talk.


62
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:45.580
-Ha, very funny.
-Why are you nervous?


63
00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:47.625
It's my first time
in the court of appeal.


64
00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.148
You're gonna do great, baby.

65
00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:51.368
You got Benner,
how bad could it be?


66
00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:52.543
All right,
I'll see you later.


67
00:02:52.587 --> 00:02:55.111
-Love you!
-Love you.


68
00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:06.992
Good luck with your case.

69
00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:09.343
Thanks, babe.
Have fun at the seminar.


70
00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:16.611
-Hey, Em?
-Yeah?


71
00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:18.047
We ever gonna
talk about it?


72
00:03:19.483 --> 00:03:20.832
I mean,
I'm not pregnant, Luke.


73
00:03:20.876 --> 00:03:22.269
So, what's there
to talk about?


74
00:03:22.312 --> 00:03:23.966
-Right?
-Right.


75
00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:25.576
Okay.

76
00:03:27.883 --> 00:03:29.058
Bye.

77
00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:35.934
Jim, I need you to understand

78
00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:37.632
what you're up against here.

79
00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:39.982
You are being charged
with multiple felonies,


80
00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:41.897
including child endangerment.

81
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.508
You're facing
nine years in prison.


82
00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:47.076
It's not too late
to ask for a plea deal.


83
00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:48.817
I told you
it was an accident.


84
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.427
Timothy's in a coma.

85
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.994
I didn't mean
to hurt him, I mean--


86
00:03:52.037 --> 00:03:54.083
I just wanted him to stop

87
00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:57.260
-bullying my daughter.
-I know that.


88
00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:59.915
But in the eyes of the law,
it doesn't matter.


89
00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.308
You pushed him on purpose,

90
00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:03.701
you don't have to intend
to hurt him.


91
00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:05.355
Do you know

92
00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:08.053
what it's like
to watch your child suffer?


93
00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:09.490
To have her
come home in tears,


94
00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:10.969
day after day?

95
00:04:11.013 --> 00:04:13.581
My wife and I,
we tried everything.


96
00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:16.583
We talked to the principal,
the school board,


97
00:04:16.627 --> 00:04:18.586
and nothing was done.

98
00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:25.549
Sorry.

99
00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:27.856
It's okay.

100
00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.423
She tried
to take her own life


101
00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:31.207
because of this asshole kid.

102
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.776
I'm so sorry.

103
00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.604
I can't even imagine

104
00:04:36.647 --> 00:04:39.084
how horrible that must have been
for you and your wife.


105
00:04:39.128 --> 00:04:40.260
How is she?

106
00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:42.610
How's Katie doing?

107
00:04:42.653 --> 00:04:44.394
She's seeing
a school therapist,


108
00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:47.049
but she's so worried

109
00:04:47.092 --> 00:04:49.007
the other kids will find out
and make fun of her.


110
00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:52.620
She-- she refuses to talk.

111
00:04:52.663 --> 00:04:56.232
I understand the therapist
doesn't want Katie to testify.


112
00:04:56.276 --> 00:04:58.190
Jim,
without Katie's testimony,


113
00:04:58.234 --> 00:05:01.411
we can't prove that this
was a form of self-defense.


114
00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:03.761
It was me,
I can tell what happened.


115
00:05:03.805 --> 00:05:05.589
That is not a good idea.

116
00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:08.766
Jim, you understandably

117
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.030
get upset when recalling
what happened, okay?


118
00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:13.728
And I cannot have
that jury thinking


119
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.251
that you are just
some angry guy.


120
00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:16.948
I need them to see you.

121
00:05:16.992 --> 00:05:19.386
To see you

122
00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:20.909
as a loving father

123
00:05:20.952 --> 00:05:23.085
who was just
protecting his daughter.


124
00:05:23.128 --> 00:05:25.305
But I have to be honest,

125
00:05:25.348 --> 00:05:27.176
the footage
the prosecution has,


126
00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.526
that is gonna be
really tough to get around.


127
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.538
Ms. Quinn, how does
the college's policy violate


128
00:05:41.582 --> 00:05:43.888
California
anti-discrimination law?


129
00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:46.108
By denying a race
that isn't white


130
00:05:46.151 --> 00:05:48.240
the right to be
part of America's history,


131
00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:51.548
its true history,
is inherently unequal.


132
00:05:51.592 --> 00:05:53.985
The college argues
that their goal is,


133
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.248
and always has been, quote:

134
00:05:56.292 --> 00:05:59.251
"To teach moral and spiritual
lessons based on the Bible."


135
00:05:59.295 --> 00:06:00.905
Does this not fall within

136
00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.864
the statutory religious
belief exceptions?


137
00:06:02.907 --> 00:06:04.126
It does not.

138
00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.736
Whiteness, as it pertains

139
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.347
to Christianity,

140
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.306
is an American
conservative perspective


141
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.047
that is neither Christian,

142
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.918
nor historically accurate.

143
00:06:13.962 --> 00:06:16.921
The only difference
between last semester and now,


144
00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:19.359
is that the politics
in this country changed.


145
00:06:19.402 --> 00:06:21.665
And certain
conservative sectors


146
00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:23.972
consider anything
not white-focused


147
00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:25.582
to be anti
-American.

148
00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:27.541
Neither of these justifications

149
00:06:27.584 --> 00:06:29.586
are deeply held
religious beliefs.


150
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.284
Rather,
they are designed to discount


151
00:06:32.328 --> 00:06:33.764
the numerous contributions

152
00:06:33.808 --> 00:06:35.853
of underrepresented
men and women,


153
00:06:35.897 --> 00:06:37.246
throughout history,

154
00:06:37.288 --> 00:06:38.726
who've made us
who we are today.


155
00:06:39.727 --> 00:06:41.032
Thank you, Ms. Quinn.

156
00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:43.295
We will take this
under advisement.


157
00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:44.819
Thank you, Your Honor.

158
00:06:47.343 --> 00:06:49.040
Judge Lola Carmichael,

159
00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:52.043
making a difference
one case at a time!


160
00:06:52.087 --> 00:06:53.218
-What?

161
00:06:53.262 --> 00:06:54.698
Oh, my Go--

162
00:06:54.742 --> 00:06:56.700
They said it was
just gonna be an article.


163
00:06:56.744 --> 00:06:57.962
-One page, at best.

164
00:06:58.006 --> 00:06:59.224
I guess they figured out

165
00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:00.617
what we already know.

166
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:01.749
Thank you, Sherri.

167
00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:04.534
Wow.

168
00:07:05.927 --> 00:07:07.885
You still worried
about Robin?


169
00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:09.887
-Or--
-Yeah.


170
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:11.672
There is what Robin says,

171
00:07:11.715 --> 00:07:12.977
and then there's
what the bureau wants.


172
00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:14.414
I mean, it took years

173
00:07:14.457 --> 00:07:16.328
and a whole baby
to get that man home.


174
00:07:16.372 --> 00:07:18.069
Robin loves you and Bailey.

175
00:07:18.113 --> 00:07:20.898
Yes, but he also loves
working for the FBI


176
00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:22.291
and living in DC.

177
00:07:22.334 --> 00:07:23.640
You have a marriage

178
00:07:23.684 --> 00:07:25.729
few people
get to experience.


179
00:07:25.773 --> 00:07:27.122
Hm, we've experienced

180
00:07:27.165 --> 00:07:30.342
our fair share
of bumps lately.


181
00:07:30.386 --> 00:07:32.388
Specifically Dre.

182
00:07:32.432 --> 00:07:33.868
Have you spoken
to him yet?


183
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:35.565
Nope.

184
00:07:36.436 --> 00:07:37.785
-Your Honor?
-I know.


185
00:07:37.828 --> 00:07:39.526
-Your Honor!
-I will.


186
00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:40.744
It's just--

187
00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:41.919
Those are two discussions

188
00:07:41.963 --> 00:07:43.399
I'm not looking forward to.

189
00:07:43.443 --> 00:07:45.793
-Who's the other one?
-Rachel.


190
00:07:51.233 --> 00:07:52.843
People's Exhibit One,
Your Honor.


191
00:07:52.887 --> 00:07:54.149
Dad!
Hey!


192
00:07:57.282 --> 00:07:58.458
Oh, my God.

193
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:03.898
Ms. Ahoka,
you're their teacher.


194
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:05.726
Were you present

195
00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:07.989
for any of the conduct
depicted in the video


196
00:08:08.032 --> 00:08:09.120
marked People's One?

197
00:08:09.164 --> 00:08:10.557
Only at the end,

198
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.428
when Timothy
was lying on the ground.


199
00:08:12.472 --> 00:08:14.299
And did you witness
an interaction


200
00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:16.301
between Timothy
and the defendant


201
00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:17.955
earlier in the day?

202
00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:20.523
Yes, the school bell
had rung for first period


203
00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:23.047
and I went outside to make sure
all the students were in.


204
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:25.833
And that's when I saw Mr. Evans
speaking with Timothy.


205
00:08:25.876 --> 00:08:27.835
And what did you hear
the defendant say?


206
00:08:30.707 --> 00:08:32.361
He's a really nice man.

207
00:08:32.404 --> 00:08:34.058
-A good dad--
-Ms. Ahoka.


208
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:35.843
Please,
just answer the question.


209
00:08:35.885 --> 00:08:37.758
What did you hear
the defendant say?


210
00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:42.980
That if Timothy
so much as looks


211
00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:44.199
at his daughter again,

212
00:08:45.156 --> 00:08:46.593
he'd pay for it.

213
00:08:49.117 --> 00:08:50.640
Sweetheart.

214
00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:55.863
Sweetheart.

215
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.744
Yeah, well,
forensic science has its flaws.


216
00:09:07.788 --> 00:09:09.703
Yes, but it's better
than nothing.


217
00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:11.226
You're not concerned about
the police's DNA database?


218
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:12.880
I'm more focused
on the individuals


219
00:09:12.923 --> 00:09:15.143
that can have
their convictions overturned--


220
00:09:15.186 --> 00:09:16.666
Well, hold that thought,
'cause, um--


221
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.755
See, this is weird.

222
00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:20.496
I think
I missed my turn.


223
00:09:21.192 --> 00:09:22.280
You think?

224
00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:28.722
I told you
not to get off of the 10.


225
00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:30.811
Well, it's better
than being stuck in traffic.


226
00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:33.117
Not if we're driving
in the wrong direction.


227
00:09:33.161 --> 00:09:35.076
We wouldn't be driving
in the wrong direction


228
00:09:35.119 --> 00:09:37.208
if you hadn't made me practice
that stupid debate with you.


229
00:09:37.252 --> 00:09:38.949
You got in my head.
You distracted me.


230
00:09:38.993 --> 00:09:40.168
I got nothing.

231
00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:42.692
Yeah.

232
00:09:42.736 --> 00:09:44.825
-Me neither.
-Look, it's all good, man.


233
00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:46.478
We'll just--
we'll backtrack.


234
00:09:46.522 --> 00:09:48.002
We've been driving
for almost two hours.


235
00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:49.699
If we backtrack,
we'll miss the seminar.


236
00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:52.223
Hold on,
wait a minute.


237
00:09:55.313 --> 00:09:57.751
Ha!

238
00:09:57.794 --> 00:10:00.014
Damn,
where'd you get that, 1992?


239
00:10:00.057 --> 00:10:01.624
-Internet, six bucks.
-Okay.


240
00:10:05.106 --> 00:10:07.761
Nicely done, good start.

241
00:10:07.804 --> 00:10:10.938
Now we just have to figure out
where the hell we are.


242
00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:16.117
Ms. Ahoka, how scared
could Timothy have been


243
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.902
if just hours later,
he was threatening


244
00:10:18.946 --> 00:10:21.035
the defendant's daughter,
yet again?


245
00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:23.907
-Objection. Argumentative.
-Sustained.


246
00:10:23.951 --> 00:10:25.430
Ms. Ahoka,
were you aware


247
00:10:25.474 --> 00:10:27.128
Katie Evans
was being bullied?


248
00:10:27.171 --> 00:10:29.957
Yes, Principal Vicario
notified the staff,


249
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.568
but I never personally saw

250
00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:34.352
Timothy bully Katie.

251
00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:36.746
You are aware that Timothy
has had behavioral issues


252
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:38.661
-in the past?
-Yes.


253
00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.794
Mm-hmm. Ms. Ahoka, isn't it true

254
00:10:40.837 --> 00:10:42.578
that you have
had to send Timothy


255
00:10:42.622 --> 00:10:45.276
to the principal's office
for discipline


256
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.365
multiple times this year?

257
00:10:47.409 --> 00:10:49.280
Too many times to remember.

258
00:10:54.677 --> 00:10:57.593
So, Social Services has agreed
to pay for childcare


259
00:10:57.637 --> 00:10:59.464
-while you're at work.
-Mm.


260
00:10:59.508 --> 00:11:01.292
Yeah. Oh. And there's
a single parent support group


261
00:11:01.336 --> 00:11:03.773
that I think will just be really
great for you, Gabriel.


262
00:11:03.817 --> 00:11:06.167
Yeah, okay.
I really appreciate everything


263
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.038
that you have done for me
these past few weeks.


264
00:11:08.082 --> 00:11:09.779
You have been amazing.

265
00:11:09.823 --> 00:11:14.001
Oh, no,
just doing my job.


266
00:11:14.044 --> 00:11:16.046
No,
it-- it meant a lot to me


267
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.831
to have you in my corner.

268
00:11:19.484 --> 00:11:21.399
Oh, I-- I'm glad
I could be here.


269
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:23.793
Please feel free
to call me...


270
00:11:24.707 --> 00:11:27.754
for anything.

271
00:11:27.797 --> 00:11:30.104
You know, there--
there is something, actually.


272
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:33.324
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?


273
00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.023
-Dinner?

274
00:11:36.066 --> 00:11:38.765
It's my way
of thanking you.


275
00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:39.853
Oh.

276
00:11:40.941 --> 00:11:42.682
-Sure.
-Yeah.


277
00:11:43.117 --> 00:11:44.205
Okay.

278
00:11:45.815 --> 00:11:48.513
Timothy has suffered
a traumatic brain injury.


279
00:11:48.557 --> 00:11:49.950
Can you explain
what that means?


280
00:11:49.993 --> 00:11:51.778
He's gone into a coma,

281
00:11:51.821 --> 00:11:53.518
which generally indicates

282
00:11:53.562 --> 00:11:55.782
widespread damage
or bruising


283
00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:57.000
across the entire cerebrum.

284
00:11:57.044 --> 00:11:58.654
And if Timothy ever

285
00:11:58.698 --> 00:12:01.178
even regains consciousness,

286
00:12:01.222 --> 00:12:02.745
will he suffer
any side effects?


287
00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:04.312
Yes, it's possible.

288
00:12:04.355 --> 00:12:05.705
There are a multitude

289
00:12:05.748 --> 00:12:06.923
of long-term effects.

290
00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:08.838
Ranging from headaches

291
00:12:08.882 --> 00:12:11.536
to seizures,
even memory loss.


292
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.278
Timothy will most likely
need medical assistance


293
00:12:14.322 --> 00:12:16.759
-for the rest of his life.
-Nothing further, Your Honor.


294
00:12:18.108 --> 00:12:19.153
Ms. Lopez.

295
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:21.416
Dr. Dunn.

296
00:12:21.938 --> 00:12:22.983
You said...

297
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:27.030
"possible,"
and "most likely."


298
00:12:27.074 --> 00:12:30.294
The truth is the brain
being so fragile,


299
00:12:30.338 --> 00:12:32.470
there really is
no way of knowing


300
00:12:32.514 --> 00:12:34.995
how Timothy will be
when he recovers.


301
00:12:35.038 --> 00:12:36.648
Yes, that's true.

302
00:12:36.692 --> 00:12:39.913
So, Timothy
could be totally fine.


303
00:12:39.956 --> 00:12:42.002
-Yes, but--
-Thank you.


304
00:12:42.045 --> 00:12:44.874
-Nothing further.
-Uh, redirect, Your Honor.


305
00:12:45.962 --> 00:12:48.660
Yes, but what, Doctor?

306
00:12:48.704 --> 00:12:51.185
It's possible
Timothy could be fine.


307
00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:53.927
But in my experience,
it's not likely.


308
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.843
And in your experience,
as a doctor,


309
00:12:56.886 --> 00:12:59.193
is there a chance
that Timothy


310
00:12:59.236 --> 00:13:01.543
may never
come out of the coma?


311
00:13:02.805 --> 00:13:05.808
Sadly... yes.

312
00:13:11.988 --> 00:13:15.470
I just can't imagine
having a child in a coma.


313
00:13:15.513 --> 00:13:17.559
Yeah, well,
my client never intended


314
00:13:17.602 --> 00:13:19.517
for Timothy
to get hurt.


315
00:13:19.561 --> 00:13:20.997
Well, I know,
and believe me,


316
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:22.651
I feel
for your client's daughter.


317
00:13:22.694 --> 00:13:24.653
But, I mean,
he did push a child, I just--


318
00:13:24.696 --> 00:13:26.481
I don't know how
you're gonna win this one, Em.


319
00:13:26.524 --> 00:13:28.439
What is your opinion
of the parents?


320
00:13:28.483 --> 00:13:31.138
Well, from what I can gather
Mr. Proctor is not home much.


321
00:13:34.489 --> 00:13:37.361
-What?
-Look who's glowing now.


322
00:13:37.405 --> 00:13:39.973
-Oh, my God. I am not.
-100%. yes, you are.


323
00:13:40.016 --> 00:13:41.757
-No. Shut up. No.
-Spill it. Okay.


324
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:44.107
-Sto-
- I--

325
00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:45.892
Okay.
Right, right, right.


326
00:13:45.935 --> 00:13:48.459
Look, I know-- I know
you told me to be careful,


327
00:13:48.503 --> 00:13:52.028
but I am
going to dinner


328
00:13:52.072 --> 00:13:53.987
tonight with Gabriel.

329
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.859
Just as a thank-you.

330
00:13:56.903 --> 00:13:58.426
I know you're gonna say

331
00:13:58.469 --> 00:13:59.862
that I could lose my job.

332
00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:01.081
I was not gonna say that.

333
00:14:01.124 --> 00:14:02.734
-I was not.
-Oh, okay.


334
00:14:02.778 --> 00:14:04.432
I just want to be sure

335
00:14:04.475 --> 00:14:07.739
that your
feelings of empathy


336
00:14:07.783 --> 00:14:11.265
are not being confused
for something more.


337
00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:13.267
I appreciate
your concern, Em, but...


338
00:14:14.268 --> 00:14:15.573
I know my heart.

339
00:14:17.488 --> 00:14:18.838
I really like him.

340
00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:20.230
And I'm just
curious to know


341
00:14:20.274 --> 00:14:22.363
if he feels the same or,

342
00:14:22.406 --> 00:14:25.714
you know, if this really is
just a thank-you meal.


343
00:14:27.281 --> 00:14:29.413
-I hear you.
-Okay.


344
00:14:29.457 --> 00:14:30.719
So, what are you gonna wear?

345
00:14:30.762 --> 00:14:32.547
-Oh!
-What are you gonna wear?


346
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.505
-I dunno! Okay, okay.
-Okay, let's talk about it.


347
00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:35.985
I've been dealing
with conservative judges


348
00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:37.117
for 20 years.

349
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.335
I've heard and handled

350
00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:40.033
a lot of bullshit, but this--

351
00:14:40.076 --> 00:14:42.687
For these two judges
to hide behind religion,


352
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:44.864
on such
an important case, I'm just--


353
00:14:45.603 --> 00:14:47.344
I'm livid.

354
00:14:47.388 --> 00:14:49.085
So, what are you gonna do?

355
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:51.392
Well, I mean,
why do you think I'm here?


356
00:14:51.435 --> 00:14:54.395
I need your candor
and your insight.


357
00:14:54.438 --> 00:14:55.875
Plenty of advice on Google.

358
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.182
Did I say
something wrong?


359
00:14:59.226 --> 00:15:00.444
No.

360
00:15:01.054 --> 00:15:02.794
No, I just--

361
00:15:02.838 --> 00:15:04.100
Tired of talking about it.

362
00:15:04.144 --> 00:15:05.885
Frankly, all Black people

363
00:15:05.928 --> 00:15:07.625
are tired
of talking about it.


364
00:15:07.669 --> 00:15:09.976
Because no matter
what is said or done,


365
00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:11.803
very little changes.

366
00:15:11.847 --> 00:15:14.632
-Well, some things have changed.

367
00:15:15.416 --> 00:15:17.505
Kamala Harris is VP,

368
00:15:17.548 --> 00:15:20.725
Ketanji Brown Jackson is
the new Supreme Court justice.


369
00:15:22.075 --> 00:15:23.859
Witnessing George Floyd's
death


370
00:15:23.903 --> 00:15:26.557
unleashed
an unprecedented expression


371
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:28.255
of outrage from white Americans.

372
00:15:28.298 --> 00:15:30.910
Do you even see
what you just did there, Lisa?


373
00:15:30.953 --> 00:15:33.390
You asked me for my opinion,
and then when I gave it to you,


374
00:15:33.434 --> 00:15:34.783
you just dismissed me.

375
00:15:35.784 --> 00:15:38.656
I was just...

376
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.136
responding to what you said.

377
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.922
But you weren't
really hearing me, Lisa.


378
00:15:42.965 --> 00:15:44.749
Allies don't wanna listen.

379
00:15:44.793 --> 00:15:46.926
They want to tell us
everything that's going right.


380
00:15:46.969 --> 00:15:48.623
Yeah, sure.
All of those things are true.


381
00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:50.059
George Floyd is dead.

382
00:15:50.103 --> 00:15:53.149
And yes,
his death unleashed outrage.


383
00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:55.020
But you know
what else it did?


384
00:15:55.064 --> 00:15:57.240
It made a whole lot of
white Americans uncomfortable.


385
00:15:57.284 --> 00:15:59.939
Why do you think
we are even debating


386
00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:01.941
whether or not
to teach Black history,


387
00:16:01.984 --> 00:16:04.813
which is American history,
in our schools?


388
00:16:05.683 --> 00:16:07.337
A lot of white people

389
00:16:07.381 --> 00:16:09.383
don't want
to confront the truth.


390
00:16:09.426 --> 00:16:11.428
They would
rather just ignore it.


391
00:16:11.472 --> 00:16:13.169
White people
don't deal well with guilt.


392
00:16:13.213 --> 00:16:14.823
You think guilt is heavy?

393
00:16:14.866 --> 00:16:18.740
Think about everything
that we carry, Lisa.


394
00:16:18.783 --> 00:16:21.786
And all we ask
is for people to just


395
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.701
see it from our side.

396
00:16:23.745 --> 00:16:25.877
To acknowledge the problems.

397
00:16:25.921 --> 00:16:28.228
Oh, I hear you.
I really hear you.


398
00:16:28.271 --> 00:16:30.099
And I admit

399
00:16:30.143 --> 00:16:34.799
that I haven't always
truly comprehended


400
00:16:34.843 --> 00:16:36.584
what Black people
are going through.


401
00:16:36.627 --> 00:16:38.020
Lisa, you're a judge.

402
00:16:39.413 --> 00:16:41.632
You have the power,

403
00:16:41.676 --> 00:16:45.375
every day,
to be a deliberate advocate.


404
00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:47.899
To dismantle these systems

405
00:16:47.943 --> 00:16:50.163
and make change
from the bench.


406
00:16:50.206 --> 00:16:51.686
So, again...

407
00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:54.297
I ask you,

408
00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:57.344
what are you
going to do, Lisa Benner?


409
00:17:00.869 --> 00:17:03.350
Mr. Vicario,
as the principal,


410
00:17:03.393 --> 00:17:05.569
were you aware
Katie Evans was being bullied?


411
00:17:05.613 --> 00:17:08.790
-Yes. Katie had reported it.
-And what was done?


412
00:17:08.833 --> 00:17:11.097
Timothy was made
to apologize to Katie.


413
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.316
He assured us
it would never happen again.


414
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.709
And that's it?

415
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:16.319
No suspension,

416
00:17:16.363 --> 00:17:17.668
no other punishment?

417
00:17:17.712 --> 00:17:19.366
-Argumentative.
-Sustained.


418
00:17:19.409 --> 00:17:21.454
Were any
other measures taken


419
00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:22.847
to discipline Timothy?

420
00:17:22.891 --> 00:17:24.632
No, Katie didn't report

421
00:17:24.674 --> 00:17:25.937
any more incidents,

422
00:17:25.981 --> 00:17:27.461
so I assumed
things were fine.


423
00:17:27.503 --> 00:17:28.636
Were you aware Katie tried

424
00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:29.767
to take her own life?

425
00:17:29.811 --> 00:17:31.160
Objection. Relevance?

426
00:17:31.204 --> 00:17:32.248
Sustained.

427
00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:35.077
Nothing further,
Your Honor.


428
00:17:36.644 --> 00:17:38.907
The court
needs a short recess.


429
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.562
Mr. Faez, your witness
when we come back in 30.


430
00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:46.567
How bad are they?

431
00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:52.529
What the hell?

432
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.021
Robin, please call me
as soon as you get this.


433
00:18:07.588 --> 00:18:09.590
Oh, Sherri,
call security.


434
00:18:09.633 --> 00:18:11.287
-Already dialing.
-I saw the pictures.


435
00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:13.768
-I'm here to help.
-No, thank you.


436
00:18:13.811 --> 00:18:15.378
David,
thank God you're here.


437
00:18:15.422 --> 00:18:17.511
-He was just leaving.
-You knew he was come-- did you?


438
00:18:17.554 --> 00:18:20.340
No, this situation calls
for all hands on deck.


439
00:18:20.383 --> 00:18:22.733
-You saw the pictures?
-Carmichael, they're everywhere.


440
00:18:22.777 --> 00:18:24.822
-Kind of hard to miss.
-They're fake!


441
00:18:24.866 --> 00:18:26.694
You know as well
as I do that doesn't matter.


442
00:18:26.737 --> 00:18:29.088
Your enemies are gonna milk this
for as long as they can.


443
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:31.394
Let's discuss
damage control.


444
00:18:31.438 --> 00:18:33.222
I've already been in touch
with all the media outlets


445
00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:34.876
and I told them
to take the pictures down.


446
00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:36.878
Great,
ideas on who's behind this?


447
00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:39.228
-My guess, Corinne Cuthbert.
-Her? But why now?


448
00:18:39.272 --> 00:18:41.709
Your cover on Legal Motion
made quite a splash.


449
00:18:41.752 --> 00:18:43.711
Corinne posted
a lot of harsh comments


450
00:18:43.754 --> 00:18:45.016
on Twitter
and several other sites.


451
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.366
"It appears Judge Carmichael has

452
00:18:46.409 --> 00:18:47.976
one set of rules
for the public


453
00:18:48.019 --> 00:18:50.065
-and another set for herself."
-Oh, crap.


454
00:18:50.109 --> 00:18:51.719
No! That's not her style.
She likes to beat


455
00:18:51.762 --> 00:18:53.460
-you fair and square.
-How do we know this's


456
00:18:53.503 --> 00:18:55.288
anything to do with Judge
Carmichael? It very well


457
00:18:55.331 --> 00:18:57.159
-could be about Mr. Armstrong.
-Sherri has a point.


458
00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:59.205
Either way, it's a hit
to your credibility and image.


459
00:18:59.248 --> 00:19:01.729
Right now, the only thing I'm
concerned about is my husband.


460
00:19:01.772 --> 00:19:04.166
-Whoa, where are you going?
-Home!


461
00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:06.125
-I need to talk to Robin.
-No, no. You are due


462
00:19:06.168 --> 00:19:07.604
-in court in 20 minutes.
-I can go.


463
00:19:07.648 --> 00:19:09.867
Hell no!
Thank you.


464
00:19:09.911 --> 00:19:12.740
Fine, I will postpone court
until tomorrow morning.


465
00:19:12.783 --> 00:19:14.524
And then
go find my husband.


466
00:19:21.662 --> 00:19:24.143
I'm scared my dad's gonna
go to prison because of me.


467
00:19:25.056 --> 00:19:26.623
Oh, Katie...

468
00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:29.583
This is not your fault, okay?

469
00:19:29.626 --> 00:19:32.803
And I am gonna do
everything in my power


470
00:19:32.847 --> 00:19:34.718
to make sure
that doesn't happen.


471
00:19:35.589 --> 00:19:37.025
I wanna testify.

472
00:19:37.068 --> 00:19:38.940
I spoke with my mom,
she agrees.


473
00:19:38.983 --> 00:19:41.377
It's the only way to prove
my dad was protecting me.


474
00:19:41.421 --> 00:19:43.510
You've been
through a lot, Katie,


475
00:19:43.553 --> 00:19:46.556
-and-- and your therapist--
-I don't care what she thinks.


476
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.688
He's my dad.

477
00:19:48.819 --> 00:19:51.126
Please, I need to help.

478
00:19:53.998 --> 00:19:55.870
I called the college,
at least they were able


479
00:19:55.913 --> 00:19:57.828
to push the debate
back 'til 7:00.


480
00:19:57.872 --> 00:19:59.308
Doesn't quite sound
like the day of bonding


481
00:19:59.352 --> 00:20:00.440
you were hoping for.

482
00:20:00.483 --> 00:20:02.442
Yeah. Not even close.

483
00:20:02.485 --> 00:20:04.095
How'd the teacher's
case go, Amy?


484
00:20:04.139 --> 00:20:06.097
It's just so hard to tell.

485
00:20:06.141 --> 00:20:07.534
The problem
with the Court of Appeal is


486
00:20:07.577 --> 00:20:09.623
there's nothing else
I can do or say.


487
00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:12.713
It's-- it's up to
the three judges now to decide.


488
00:20:12.756 --> 00:20:15.150
Well, the good thing is
you only need two to agree.


489
00:20:15.194 --> 00:20:17.979
I think it's great, Amy, you
taking this case on pro bono.


490
00:20:18.022 --> 00:20:19.850
This weight
is killing me.


491
00:20:19.894 --> 00:20:21.678
Baby, there's nothing
you can do, okay?


492
00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:23.550
You just
gotta let it go.


493
00:20:23.593 --> 00:20:24.986
I can't, Mark.

494
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:26.814
It's too important.

495
00:20:26.857 --> 00:20:28.990
This decision
will affect a lot of kids.


496
00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:30.513
Someday,

497
00:20:30.557 --> 00:20:31.906
maybe even our own.

498
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.039
I love you.

499
00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:36.171
And I love you.

500
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.436
You guys,
uh, talking about kids?


501
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.091
Yeah, I mean,
not now, but maybe soon.


502
00:20:44.571 --> 00:20:46.660
Emily and I
had a pregnancy scare.


503
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.575
Yeah?

504
00:20:48.618 --> 00:20:49.706
She's not.

505
00:20:51.404 --> 00:20:53.449
But for a minute,
I thought I was gonna be a dad.


506
00:20:54.624 --> 00:20:55.669
And how'd you feel?

507
00:20:57.061 --> 00:20:58.628
Surprisingly...

508
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.240
excited.

509
00:21:01.283 --> 00:21:02.980
Okay, Papa Watkins.

510
00:21:03.024 --> 00:21:04.373
-Okay.

511
00:21:05.461 --> 00:21:06.680
Look out.

512
00:21:09.117 --> 00:21:11.075
I told you
I didn't want Katie to testify.


513
00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:13.252
Katie came to me.
She wants to help.


514
00:21:13.295 --> 00:21:14.992
I demand you
to put me on the stand.


515
00:21:15.036 --> 00:21:17.256
Look, you've given me
all the reasons


516
00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:21.216
why I shouldn't, but Katie is
the one reason why I should.


517
00:21:22.696 --> 00:21:24.219
You know what? That's--

518
00:21:24.263 --> 00:21:25.481
Okay, let's try.

519
00:21:25.525 --> 00:21:26.569
Please have a seat.

520
00:21:30.965 --> 00:21:32.009
Mr. Evans,

521
00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:34.751
isn't it true
you threatened


522
00:21:34.795 --> 00:21:36.405
a 13-year-old boy,

523
00:21:36.449 --> 00:21:38.494
a boy who is
half your size?


524
00:21:38.538 --> 00:21:41.671
Yes, but, you know,
I just wanted to scare him


525
00:21:41.715 --> 00:21:43.369
so he'd stay away
from my daughter.


526
00:21:43.412 --> 00:21:45.414
But he didn't, did he?

527
00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:47.547
So, you decided

528
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.724
to take matters into
your own hands and hurt him?


529
00:21:50.767 --> 00:21:53.727
What, no!
I-- I didn't mean to hurt him.


530
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.295
-It was an accident.
-Did you push him?


531
00:21:56.338 --> 00:21:58.775
-Yes, but I didn't--
-Then how is that an accident?


532
00:22:01.212 --> 00:22:02.997
Dammit.

533
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.695
Jim, I wish
there was another way.


534
00:22:05.739 --> 00:22:08.002
I wish there was another way,
but there isn't.


535
00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:11.527
Katie has to testify.

536
00:22:14.704 --> 00:22:16.358
There you are.

537
00:22:16.402 --> 00:22:17.533
Judge Maples.

538
00:22:19.056 --> 00:22:20.667
Judge Benner.

539
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.103
With all due respect,

540
00:22:22.146 --> 00:22:24.192
you need
to accept my decision.


541
00:22:24.235 --> 00:22:28.892
-I have something for you.
-The Warmth of Other Suns.


542
00:22:28.936 --> 00:22:31.330
It's an excellent book
about the Great Migration.


543
00:22:31.373 --> 00:22:33.157
And I know
how much you love history.


544
00:22:33.201 --> 00:22:35.377
I think
you might enjoy it.


545
00:22:35.421 --> 00:22:36.813
I know
what you're up to, Lisa.


546
00:22:38.424 --> 00:22:41.340
Ken, it's just a book.

547
00:22:41.383 --> 00:22:43.603
That I think
everyone should be able to read.


548
00:22:43.646 --> 00:22:45.561
-I look forward to discussing.

549
00:22:48.303 --> 00:22:50.479
There you go. Enjoy.

550
00:22:57.573 --> 00:22:59.314
I put Bailey down.

551
00:22:59.358 --> 00:23:01.360
In case you wanna go
in there and say good night.


552
00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:03.057
I do.

553
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.059
But first, I want to know
why you didn't return


554
00:23:05.102 --> 00:23:07.540
a single phone call
to me today.


555
00:23:07.583 --> 00:23:09.411
I had some thinking to do.

556
00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:11.239
Robin...

557
00:23:11.282 --> 00:23:13.023
the pictures
are not real.


558
00:23:13.067 --> 00:23:14.982
They are photoshopped.

559
00:23:15.025 --> 00:23:16.113
All but this one.

560
00:23:18.681 --> 00:23:20.944
You wanna tell me
why you were there meeting him?


561
00:23:20.988 --> 00:23:23.033
I wasn't there meeting him.

562
00:23:23.077 --> 00:23:25.819
It was a chance meeting.

563
00:23:25.862 --> 00:23:27.516
I was at Luna Ray with Mark.

564
00:23:28.082 --> 00:23:29.431
And the kiss?

565
00:23:29.475 --> 00:23:30.824
It was an innocent goodbye peck.

566
00:23:30.867 --> 00:23:32.303
Baby, if you don't believe me,

567
00:23:32.347 --> 00:23:34.001
then just call Mark and ask him.

568
00:23:34.044 --> 00:23:36.177
I believe you, Lo.

569
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.571
It just
seems like every time


570
00:23:38.614 --> 00:23:40.529
we're past the issue,

571
00:23:40.573 --> 00:23:42.662
Andre punk ass
pops back up.


572
00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:47.144
I'm sorry.

573
00:23:47.188 --> 00:23:48.755
You're right.

574
00:23:48.798 --> 00:23:51.018
And despite my objections,

575
00:23:51.061 --> 00:23:53.194
David Sanders
insisted on helping out.


576
00:23:54.413 --> 00:23:55.457
David Sanders, huh?

577
00:23:56.806 --> 00:23:58.504
He may have some connections
that I don't have.


578
00:23:58.547 --> 00:24:00.810
So, you're okay with
David Sanders all of a sudden?


579
00:24:00.854 --> 00:24:03.378
No, but he does know

580
00:24:03.422 --> 00:24:05.032
how to play
the political game.


581
00:24:05.075 --> 00:24:07.382
More importantly,
I spoke with a couple


582
00:24:07.426 --> 00:24:09.602
sources of mine at the FBI.

583
00:24:09.645 --> 00:24:12.387
And a buddy of mine
is going to shadow you.


584
00:24:12.431 --> 00:24:14.694
Baby,
I don't need a bodyguard.


585
00:24:14.737 --> 00:24:17.784
Lo,
someone took that picture.


586
00:24:17.827 --> 00:24:19.568
Meaning someone
was following you.


587
00:24:20.787 --> 00:24:24.486
And until I know who and why,

588
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.488
you're not going
anywhere by yourself.


589
00:24:37.586 --> 00:24:39.849
You
didn't like it, did you?


590
00:24:39.893 --> 00:24:41.329
What? No, no.

591
00:24:41.372 --> 00:24:42.896
-No, I did, I really did.
-Uh-huh.


592
00:24:42.939 --> 00:24:44.201
It's just, um--

593
00:24:44.245 --> 00:24:46.682
You know, I have never had

594
00:24:46.726 --> 00:24:48.075
clams on my pizza.

595
00:24:48.118 --> 00:24:49.903
-Okay.

596
00:24:49.946 --> 00:24:51.687
Okay, I'm sorry,
I guess, you know,


597
00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:54.734
I'm just-- I'm more
of a pepperoni cheese kinda gal.


598
00:24:55.735 --> 00:24:57.954
Okay, good.
That's good to know.


599
00:24:57.998 --> 00:24:59.478
You know,
I'll remember that.


600
00:25:00.217 --> 00:25:02.437
Yeah, for next time.

601
00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:04.047
Next time?

602
00:25:04.091 --> 00:25:07.050
Wait, I thought this was
just a thank-you dinner.


603
00:25:07.094 --> 00:25:11.446
Uh, I may have given
false testimony.


604
00:25:12.491 --> 00:25:13.840
-Oh?

605
00:25:16.495 --> 00:25:17.931
See, the thing is, um...

606
00:25:18.758 --> 00:25:19.802
I like you.

607
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:23.066
Yeah, um, I-
- I like you, too.

608
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.242
No, I mean, I...

609
00:25:26.853 --> 00:25:28.811
really like you.

610
00:25:30.596 --> 00:25:31.640
Oh.

611
00:25:37.385 --> 00:25:39.474
-Um--
-I'm moving too fast.


612
00:25:39.518 --> 00:25:40.910
No, no, no,
um, it's, uh...


613
00:25:45.436 --> 00:25:48.265
It's perfect.

614
00:25:48.309 --> 00:25:49.615
Yeah.

615
00:25:54.533 --> 00:25:56.839
And what exactly
do we have here?


616
00:25:56.883 --> 00:25:58.319
I went over your past cases,

617
00:25:58.362 --> 00:26:00.408
and these are
the prime suspects.


618
00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:02.149
Every single one of these
people have a reason


619
00:26:02.192 --> 00:26:04.412
-to want to see you fail.
-David Sanders?


620
00:26:04.455 --> 00:26:06.283
Think about it.
What better way for him


621
00:26:06.327 --> 00:26:07.937
to swoop in and be the hero?

622
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.115
Speak of the devil.

623
00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:13.682
Yes, David?

624
00:26:13.726 --> 00:26:15.249
Well, why can't you just tell me

625
00:26:15.292 --> 00:26:17.425
over the phone?
I'm in court all day.


626
00:26:18.818 --> 00:26:20.950
Fine.
I'll see you this afternoon.


627
00:26:22.038 --> 00:26:23.910
Well, what did he want?

628
00:26:23.953 --> 00:26:25.520
Apparently he found out
who's behind the photos.


629
00:26:25.564 --> 00:26:27.522
Hah! Of course he did. And?

630
00:26:27.566 --> 00:26:29.306
He needs to tell me in person.

631
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.395
Okay, I knew you were just

632
00:26:31.439 --> 00:26:33.223
trying to worm
your way back into our lives--


633
00:26:33.267 --> 00:26:34.529
Sherr-
- Sherri. Sherri.

634
00:26:34.573 --> 00:26:36.400
That is not gonna happen. Okay?

635
00:26:36.444 --> 00:26:38.272
Let's just
hear what he has to say


636
00:26:38.315 --> 00:26:39.447
and then be done with him.

637
00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:42.668
Oh, you, you!

638
00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.889
One chance.
One chance...


639
00:26:48.935 --> 00:26:53.156
Um, Timothy would
call me names.


640
00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.984
Would make fun of me.

641
00:26:55.028 --> 00:26:57.639
Would kick the back of my
knees so that I would fall.


642
00:26:57.683 --> 00:27:00.120
Did you ever
tell anyone at the school?


643
00:27:00.163 --> 00:27:01.687
Once.

644
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.950
But it only
made things worse.


645
00:27:03.993 --> 00:27:07.083
Timothy blamed me
for getting him in trouble.


646
00:27:07.127 --> 00:27:10.043
Katie, let's talk about
the day of the incident, okay?


647
00:27:11.044 --> 00:27:12.523
What happened?

648
00:27:13.307 --> 00:27:14.656
I had band practice...

649
00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:19.443
and when I came out,
Timothy was waiting.


650
00:27:19.487 --> 00:27:21.707
He called
my dad a loser.


651
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.926
Said he knew
where I got it from.


652
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.190
So, I tried to walk away,
but he grabbed my arm.


653
00:27:32.326 --> 00:27:33.632
Said that I should, um...

654
00:27:35.372 --> 00:27:36.852
that I should kill myself.

655
00:27:39.725 --> 00:27:42.118
And that's
when my dad came,


656
00:27:42.162 --> 00:27:44.686
and he yelled at Timothy
to get away from me, but...


657
00:27:46.732 --> 00:27:48.385
Timothy just laughed.

658
00:27:51.562 --> 00:27:54.174
So, my dad
pushed him away, and...


659
00:27:54.217 --> 00:27:55.697
He was just
trying to protect me.


660
00:28:00.746 --> 00:28:02.182
Okay, honey.

661
00:28:02.225 --> 00:28:04.140
I know
that was difficult.


662
00:28:04.184 --> 00:28:05.272
You okay?

663
00:28:06.926 --> 00:28:08.405
Your Honor,
I have no further questions.


664
00:28:08.449 --> 00:28:10.407
Katie, are you
okay to continue?


665
00:28:10.451 --> 00:28:11.887
Or would you like
to take a break?


666
00:28:15.369 --> 00:28:17.240
Court is
in recess until 3:00 pm.


667
00:28:17.284 --> 00:28:19.373
Council in my chambers, please.

668
00:28:22.985 --> 00:28:24.552
I'm gonna give Katie

669
00:28:24.595 --> 00:28:26.554
the rest of the afternoon
to gather herself.


670
00:28:26.597 --> 00:28:28.861
Mr. Faez,
you will have the opportunity


671
00:28:28.904 --> 00:28:30.689
to cross-examine
tomorrow afternoon.


672
00:28:30.732 --> 00:28:32.386
Your Honor,
the People are open


673
00:28:32.429 --> 00:28:33.996
to discussing
a possible plea deal.


674
00:28:34.562 --> 00:28:36.129
Ms. Lopez.

675
00:28:36.172 --> 00:28:38.827
I have tried from day one

676
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:40.655
to get my client
to ask for a plea deal.


677
00:28:40.699 --> 00:28:41.961
He refuses.

678
00:28:42.004 --> 00:28:44.093
He's hoping that the publicity

679
00:28:44.137 --> 00:28:45.442
from the trial will somehow

680
00:28:45.486 --> 00:28:47.227
force the school
to make changes.


681
00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.229
Ms. Lopez,
your client needs


682
00:28:49.272 --> 00:28:52.536
to seriously consider
resolving this case.


683
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:55.888
I'm sorry
we missed the seminar.


684
00:28:55.931 --> 00:28:57.454
I'm sorry
your car broke down.


685
00:28:57.498 --> 00:28:59.674
No, it's all good now.

686
00:28:59.718 --> 00:29:01.154
You know,
I think I got bed bugs


687
00:29:01.197 --> 00:29:02.329
from that damn motel.

688
00:29:03.939 --> 00:29:07.551
This is
the worst road trip ever.


689
00:29:07.595 --> 00:29:09.858
Agreed.

690
00:29:09.902 --> 00:29:11.642
I was really
looking forward to this.


691
00:29:11.686 --> 00:29:13.122
Me too.

692
00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:14.907
Yeah,
but for different reasons.


693
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.865
You were looking forward
to kicking my ass at the debate.


694
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:18.171
I was actually
looking forward to spending


695
00:29:18.214 --> 00:29:19.302
some quality time with you.

696
00:29:19.346 --> 00:29:21.652
-Really?
-Yeah.


697
00:29:21.696 --> 00:29:23.219
Man, I didn't care
about the debate,


698
00:29:23.263 --> 00:29:24.743
I just wanted
to hang out with you.


699
00:29:24.786 --> 00:29:27.441
-For real?
-Only reason why I'm here.


700
00:29:27.484 --> 00:29:29.530
-Oh, okay. My God.

701
00:29:29.573 --> 00:29:31.358
Well, we should get--
we gotta make a plan


702
00:29:31.401 --> 00:29:32.881
to do this more often,
all right?


703
00:29:32.925 --> 00:29:34.578
Like a pact, all right?
Once a month.


704
00:29:34.622 --> 00:29:36.972
-Whoa! That will never happen.
-It could.


705
00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:38.757
You're getting married
in 10 weeks.


706
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.888
That's crazy.

707
00:29:39.932 --> 00:29:41.585
Other people make it work.

708
00:29:41.629 --> 00:29:42.761
We can, too.

709
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.937
I'mma hold you to that.

710
00:29:46.025 --> 00:29:47.809
Pow.

711
00:29:47.853 --> 00:29:50.159
With Robin's help,
we uncovered that--


712
00:29:56.775 --> 00:29:58.341
That it was Martin Moore.

713
00:29:58.385 --> 00:30:00.822
You tried his son last year?
Alexander Moore.


714
00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:03.216
He tried to blame his friend
for a murder he committed.


715
00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:05.653
-Martin Moore is his father.
-Right. I remember.


716
00:30:05.696 --> 00:30:07.568
That was Rachel
and Amy's client.


717
00:30:07.611 --> 00:30:10.005
I read that he got his son
out of prison six months ago.


718
00:30:10.049 --> 00:30:12.355
Why would he still
care about going after Lola?


719
00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:15.445
Revenge, Moore blames
everyone involved in the case.


720
00:30:15.489 --> 00:30:18.144
He's told several associates
that he's out to ruin you all.


721
00:30:18.187 --> 00:30:19.536
You need to watch your back.

722
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.234
Her Honor's back
is always watched.


723
00:30:21.277 --> 00:30:25.151
I am not afraid of Martin Moore.

724
00:30:25.194 --> 00:30:28.545
I guess... thanks are in order.
But let me be clear.


725
00:30:28.589 --> 00:30:31.635
This does not change
anything between us.


726
00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:34.551
What you put
Sherri and I through...


727
00:30:34.595 --> 00:30:37.990
-we can never forgive.
-I understand.


728
00:30:38.033 --> 00:30:40.819
And for what it's worth,
I know I made a huge mistake,


729
00:30:40.862 --> 00:30:42.603
and I'm truly sorry.

730
00:30:42.646 --> 00:30:44.692
But I'm determined
to prove myself to you again.


731
00:30:44.735 --> 00:30:46.259
You're the real deal,
Judge Carmichael.


732
00:30:46.302 --> 00:30:47.913
You're destined
for great things.


733
00:30:47.956 --> 00:30:49.610
And there's no doubt
in my mind...


734
00:30:50.654 --> 00:30:52.134
I'm the one
who can get you there.


735
00:30:59.446 --> 00:31:01.752
Oh, my God,
the gall of that man.


736
00:31:04.407 --> 00:31:05.887
I think she likes him.

737
00:31:09.238 --> 00:31:10.457
Uh, so, um...

738
00:31:11.762 --> 00:31:14.113
I thought
a lot about what you said.


739
00:31:14.156 --> 00:31:18.117
These past few years,
I thought my eyes were open.


740
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.772
I thought that I was
helping the greater good.


741
00:31:21.816 --> 00:31:23.949
Reading the books,
attending protests.


742
00:31:23.992 --> 00:31:27.169
I even
put up a BLM sign.


743
00:31:27.213 --> 00:31:28.388
I remember.

744
00:31:29.041 --> 00:31:30.042
Yeah.

745
00:31:31.043 --> 00:31:32.522
It wasn't enough.

746
00:31:32.566 --> 00:31:35.221
To be a true ally
and advocate


747
00:31:35.264 --> 00:31:37.527
is a lifelong commitment.

748
00:31:37.571 --> 00:31:39.747
Having
uncomfortable conversations


749
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.140
not just
with my colleagues,


750
00:31:41.183 --> 00:31:43.316
but with my family
and friends.


751
00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:46.319
And even the neighbor
who complains about my sign.


752
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.625
So you checked Google?

753
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:51.498
Yes, yes.

754
00:31:51.541 --> 00:31:55.894
My favorite was a YouTube series
with Emmanuel Acho,


755
00:31:55.937 --> 00:31:58.548
"Uncomfortable Conversations
with a Black Man".


756
00:31:58.592 --> 00:32:01.160
He said something
that really stuck with me.


757
00:32:01.203 --> 00:32:04.598
"Everything great
is birthed through discomfort."


758
00:32:06.295 --> 00:32:09.429
I hope you know
how much your friendship


759
00:32:09.472 --> 00:32:11.822
means to me, Carmichael.

760
00:32:12.998 --> 00:32:15.739
Back at you,
Lisa Benner.


761
00:32:21.571 --> 00:32:23.443
Emily?

762
00:32:23.486 --> 00:32:26.011
I'll agree
to strike the GBI allegation.


763
00:32:26.054 --> 00:32:27.882
He can plead
to the felony child endangerment


764
00:32:27.926 --> 00:32:29.231
for the minimum conditions.

765
00:32:29.275 --> 00:32:30.885
It's no jail time,

766
00:32:30.929 --> 00:32:32.800
four years probation
and parenting classes.


767
00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:36.673
Thank you, Rory.
That's a fair deal.


768
00:32:36.717 --> 00:32:38.719
You're not the only one
who was troubled over this case.


769
00:32:38.762 --> 00:32:39.938
I have three kids.

770
00:32:40.764 --> 00:32:41.983
I'll take it to my client.

771
00:32:42.027 --> 00:32:43.289
-Good luck.
-Thanks.


772
00:32:48.207 --> 00:32:49.686
-Jim.
-Hey.


773
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.167
-Hey. Listen.

774
00:32:54.648 --> 00:32:57.259
The DA has just
given us a good offer.


775
00:32:57.303 --> 00:32:59.609
I really think
you should consider taking it.


776
00:32:59.653 --> 00:33:01.307
Hang in there, Jim.

777
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.179
There are parents here
to show their support.


778
00:33:04.223 --> 00:33:06.268
I have been trying
for two years


779
00:33:06.312 --> 00:33:07.704
to get someone
to pay attention.


780
00:33:07.748 --> 00:33:09.228
I cannot give up now.

781
00:33:09.271 --> 00:33:11.317
Jim, please, I'm--

782
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.668
-Just think of Katie.
-I am thinking of her.


783
00:33:14.711 --> 00:33:17.410
Something has to change.
The bullying has to stop.


784
00:33:17.453 --> 00:33:21.022
And if going to prison for
trying to protect my daughter


785
00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:22.981
is the only way
to make a difference then...


786
00:33:24.504 --> 00:33:25.635
so be it.

787
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:27.681
Jim...

788
00:33:40.999 --> 00:33:43.175
Before I call
the jury back in,


789
00:33:43.218 --> 00:33:45.612
the court was informed
the People made an offer.


790
00:33:45.655 --> 00:33:47.657
-We have, Your Honor.
-Your Honor...


791
00:33:47.701 --> 00:33:50.921
I ask for time for my client
to consider the offer.


792
00:33:52.836 --> 00:33:54.838
Very well,
you have until tomorrow.


793
00:33:54.882 --> 00:33:58.320
Ms. Lopez,
may I speak with your client?


794
00:33:58.364 --> 00:33:59.756
Of course, Your Honor.

795
00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:07.199
Mr. Evans, I would like
to speak to you not as a judge,


796
00:34:07.242 --> 00:34:09.375
but as a fellow parent.

797
00:34:09.418 --> 00:34:13.813
I understand
the need to do something.


798
00:34:13.857 --> 00:34:18.862
To... help change the system
when we see a wrong.


799
00:34:18.906 --> 00:34:21.387
But what you did...

800
00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:24.607
taking matters into your own
hands, has repercussions.


801
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:28.089
You put a child
into the hospital.


802
00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:30.351
And if you are found guilty,
you could spend up to


803
00:34:30.396 --> 00:34:33.790
nine years in prison.
That is a long time


804
00:34:33.833 --> 00:34:35.400
to be away
from your daughter.


805
00:34:35.444 --> 00:34:38.665
A daughter
who needs you right now.


806
00:34:39.492 --> 00:34:41.320
Please, Mr. Evans.

807
00:34:41.362 --> 00:34:43.409
Take this time

808
00:34:43.452 --> 00:34:45.498
to really
consider your decision.


809
00:34:47.065 --> 00:34:49.632
I will.
Thank you, Your Honor.


810
00:34:49.676 --> 00:34:51.243
The court is adjourned
until 9 a.m.


811
00:34:57.074 --> 00:34:58.728
-Hey.
-Hi.


812
00:34:58.772 --> 00:35:01.035
Listen,
I have some good news.


813
00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:03.516
Timothy's parents weren't in
the courtroom earlier because...


814
00:35:04.169 --> 00:35:05.822
...he woke up.

815
00:35:05.866 --> 00:35:07.998
It was only for a few moments,
but he-- he--


816
00:35:08.042 --> 00:35:10.392
he woke up!
He's making progress.


817
00:35:10.436 --> 00:35:11.524
Oh, thank God.

818
00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.135
That's amazing news.

819
00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:15.615
I wanted to run
something else past you.


820
00:35:15.658 --> 00:35:18.705
I found
an amazing therapist.


821
00:35:18.748 --> 00:35:20.185
She's agreed
to work with Katie.


822
00:35:20.228 --> 00:35:22.012
She has
no connection to the school,


823
00:35:22.056 --> 00:35:23.449
so Katie
won't have to worry


824
00:35:23.492 --> 00:35:24.928
about the other kids
finding out.


825
00:35:26.408 --> 00:35:28.628
Thank you, Ms. Lopez.

826
00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:30.717
I appreciate
everything you've done.


827
00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.762
You're welcome.

828
00:35:32.806 --> 00:35:35.983
But there is one last thing
we need to discuss.


829
00:35:39.291 --> 00:35:40.814
Prosecution's offer.

830
00:35:44.252 --> 00:35:46.080
Your Honor.

831
00:35:46.124 --> 00:35:47.995
Ms. Lopez and Mr. Faez
are here to see you.


832
00:35:48.038 --> 00:35:49.518
Oh, send them in.

833
00:35:51.694 --> 00:35:53.479
Thanks, Ms. Kansky.

834
00:35:53.522 --> 00:35:56.221
My client, Your Honor,
has decided to accept the offer.


835
00:35:56.264 --> 00:35:58.658
Very well.
I have considered the offer


836
00:35:58.701 --> 00:36:00.747
and am willing
to go along with it.


837
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.053
We will take the plea in
the morning and excuse the jury.


838
00:36:03.097 --> 00:36:04.925
Thank you, Mr. Faez.

839
00:36:04.968 --> 00:36:06.274
It's a pleasure,
Your Honor.


840
00:36:06.318 --> 00:36:07.362
-Thank you.
-Great.


841
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.887
And Your Honor,
I wanted to thank you


842
00:36:10.931 --> 00:36:12.628
for your
parent-to-parent speech.


843
00:36:12.672 --> 00:36:14.413
I know that's...
absolutely


844
00:36:14.456 --> 00:36:15.849
why my client
changed his mind.


845
00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:17.590
You're welcome.

846
00:36:20.375 --> 00:36:21.463
What is it?

847
00:36:21.507 --> 00:36:22.986
Just...

848
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.032
as a parent, how--

849
00:36:25.075 --> 00:36:28.601
How do you watch
something like this case


850
00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:31.125
and not let it
just totally...


851
00:36:32.605 --> 00:36:34.433
utterly consume you?

852
00:36:37.958 --> 00:36:40.700
Life is full of fear.

853
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.007
And hope.

854
00:36:44.051 --> 00:36:45.835
And I choose
to hold on to the hope.


855
00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.972
Come on.

856
00:36:59.545 --> 00:37:01.111
Em.

857
00:37:01.155 --> 00:37:03.201
-You made it back.
-I did.


858
00:37:05.768 --> 00:37:07.509
Muah

859
00:37:07.553 --> 00:37:10.251
Hey, is it okay if we just
grab takeout and go home?


860
00:37:10.295 --> 00:37:11.731
I really need to shower.

861
00:37:11.774 --> 00:37:13.602
-Perfect.
-Pizza?


862
00:37:14.386 --> 00:37:15.952
I was thinking Mexican.

863
00:37:15.996 --> 00:37:18.607
-Ooh, El--
-PadÃ­an.


864
00:37:18.651 --> 00:37:20.218
Yes, absolutely.

865
00:37:21.088 --> 00:37:22.176
Hey, uh...

866
00:37:23.656 --> 00:37:27.225
Were you serious
about not wanting kids?


867
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:29.357
Honestly, babe...

868
00:37:30.489 --> 00:37:32.012
this case was brutal!
It was...


869
00:37:33.622 --> 00:37:35.494
And everything that's going on
in the world right now?


870
00:37:36.799 --> 00:37:40.629
There are so many reasons
not to have kids.


871
00:37:40.673 --> 00:37:43.763
I really...
Want to be a dad.


872
00:37:43.806 --> 00:37:47.723
And I see kids
in my future.


873
00:37:47.767 --> 00:37:49.856
And I know the world
is a messed up place,


874
00:37:49.899 --> 00:37:51.640
but isn't that even more
reason to have them?


875
00:37:51.684 --> 00:37:53.251
How is that
a reason to have them?


876
00:37:53.294 --> 00:37:55.949
Because they are the future.

877
00:37:55.992 --> 00:37:57.777
And there's a chance
that they might be the ones


878
00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.909
that get it right.

879
00:37:59.953 --> 00:38:03.173
I wish that I could...
say to you all the things


880
00:38:03.217 --> 00:38:05.088
that you want to hear,
that you need to hear.


881
00:38:05.132 --> 00:38:08.309
I wish that I could tell you
with certainty that one day,


882
00:38:08.353 --> 00:38:10.485
yes, I want to have kids,
but I'm just...


883
00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:13.140
I'm not there.

884
00:38:25.152 --> 00:38:26.980
I feel like
I've been gone for a week.


885
00:38:27.023 --> 00:38:28.460
-Ugh!
-Oh!


886
00:38:28.503 --> 00:38:30.592
You clearly
smell like you have--


887
00:38:30.636 --> 00:38:31.941
Callan! Ugh!

888
00:38:31.985 --> 00:38:34.901
-Are you serious?
-You stink! Yes.


889
00:38:34.944 --> 00:38:36.772
I was afraid
to shower at the hotel.


890
00:38:36.816 --> 00:38:38.470
Everything had
mold growing on it.


891
00:38:38.513 --> 00:38:40.515
You could have
at least changed your clothes.


892
00:38:40.559 --> 00:38:43.823
What don't you understand about
mold growing on everything?


893
00:38:46.086 --> 00:38:49.350
The a court of appeals
made a decision.


894
00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:51.309
Oh, my God.
I'm too nervous. I can't look.


895
00:38:51.352 --> 00:38:52.614
-Okay--
-No.


896
00:38:55.095 --> 00:38:57.924
"America is a melting pot
for a reason.


897
00:38:57.967 --> 00:39:00.666
Black history, 
Latino history,

898
00:39:00.709 --> 00:39:02.972
Native American history...

899
00:39:03.016 --> 00:39:05.714
-are all part..."
-...of America's history.


900
00:39:07.673 --> 00:39:12.199
Denying education
based on any race...


901
00:39:12.242 --> 00:39:15.333
can instill
a sense of inferiority


902
00:39:15.376 --> 00:39:18.205
that can have
huge detrimental effects


903
00:39:18.248 --> 00:39:21.339
on the education
and personal growth of children.


904
00:39:23.384 --> 00:39:26.561
We find this mandate
to be a clear attempt


905
00:39:26.605 --> 00:39:28.737
to subdue
the accomplishments


906
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:30.696
and perspectives
of black people


907
00:39:30.739 --> 00:39:32.654
-and other groups...
-...Who have long-faced


908
00:39:32.698 --> 00:39:35.353
rejection and marginalization
in our schools.


909
00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.096
You won.

910
00:39:40.793 --> 00:39:41.881
We won.

911
00:39:46.015 --> 00:39:47.930
Hey,
thought I was gonna miss you.


912
00:39:47.974 --> 00:39:49.628
My flight's in an hour.

913
00:39:49.671 --> 00:39:51.673
Moses is in the back
taking care of Bailey.


914
00:39:51.717 --> 00:39:53.893
-Uh, we need to talk.
-About Martin Moore?


915
00:39:53.936 --> 00:39:55.851
I know. It was my contact
that figured it out.


916
00:39:55.895 --> 00:39:58.027
Thank you for helping,
but no,


917
00:39:58.071 --> 00:39:59.551
I'm referring
to those pictures.


918
00:39:59.594 --> 00:40:02.075
Clearly, they brought up
some bad feelings,


919
00:40:02.118 --> 00:40:03.729
and I think we
should talk about 'em


920
00:40:03.772 --> 00:40:06.079
before you get on a plane
and leave for a week.


921
00:40:06.122 --> 00:40:09.648
Look, Lo, I love you.
You know that.


922
00:40:09.691 --> 00:40:12.302
And there's nothing I wouldn't
do for this family.


923
00:40:12.346 --> 00:40:16.132
But I will not
compete with a memory.


924
00:40:16.176 --> 00:40:17.873
Don't try to deny it,
you still have


925
00:40:17.917 --> 00:40:19.353
unresolved feelings
for that man.


926
00:40:19.397 --> 00:40:21.529
No, had.

927
00:40:21.573 --> 00:40:25.533
I had feelings for him,
and they are in the past.


928
00:40:25.577 --> 00:40:27.187
And see, it's that look,

929
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.711
which is exactly why
we need to talk about it.


930
00:40:29.755 --> 00:40:32.235
Look. No time.

931
00:40:32.279 --> 00:40:34.847
-Gotta catch my flight.
-Robin.


932
00:40:37.937 --> 00:40:40.548
-Damn.
-What?


933
00:40:40.592 --> 00:40:43.246
Three hour flight delay
just ruined my dramatic exit.


934
00:40:48.034 --> 00:40:49.992
Looks like
someone upstairs


935
00:40:50.036 --> 00:40:52.299
knows that
we need to talk.


936
00:40:52.342 --> 00:40:54.649
-Looks that way.
-Uh-huh.


937
00:40:54.693 --> 00:40:56.651
Look at them lips.

938
00:40:59.306 --> 00:41:01.569
-I love you.
-I love you.
