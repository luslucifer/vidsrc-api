<i>but somewhere
in Northern Virginia.</i>


617
00:34:01.014 --> 00:34:04.680
<i>Prince had been driving
to see his fiancée.</i>


618
00:34:04.764 --> 00:34:08.305
<i>He was killed
yards from her home.</i>


619
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.972
And the only witness
to the killing of Prince Jones


620
00:34:11.056 --> 00:34:12.639
was the killer himself.

621
00:34:13.806 --> 00:34:15.639
<i>The officer had been
dressed like</i>


622

623
00:34:17.972 --> 00:34:19.472
<i>He'd been sent out
to track a man</i>


624
00:34:19.555 --> 00:34:22.389
<i>whose build was five foot four
and 250 pounds.</i>


625
00:34:22.472 --> 00:34:23.639
We know from the coroner

626
00:34:23.722 --> 00:34:27.014
that Prince's body was
six foot three and 211 pounds.

<i>The officer claimed
that Prince had tried</i>

00:34:30.347 --> 00:34:32.806
<i>to run him over with his Jeep,

630

We know
that the authorities charged


631
00:34:40.472 --> 00:34:42.098
with investigating the shooting

632
00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.263
did very little
to investigate the officer


633
00:34:44.347 --> 00:34:46.014

in their power

635

no information

My curiosity,

would rather ask

for police support
than complain about brutality,


725

told that the Black citizens
were comfortable,

justified the jails,
