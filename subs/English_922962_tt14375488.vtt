1
00:00:11.563 --> 00:00:13.078
I think it's time

2
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.458
we all recognize what this is
and stop ignoring the facts.


3
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.872
Wherever this thing came from,

4
00:00:16.874 --> 00:00:19.803
it's the end of the
world as we know it.


5
00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:22.665
There was before COVID-19
and there was after.


6
00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:25.492
COVID-19 is simply
devastating our world.


7
00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:26.975
We weren't prepared.

8
00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:28.320
We aren't prepared.

9
00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:30.147
The CDC is
expecting the death toll


10
00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.699
to be two to five
million people,


11
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:34.182
and you still have
people out at the stores,


12
00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:37.492
and they are still out
acting like they don't care


13
00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:39.320
that this virus is
right on their doorstep.


14
00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.837
Our national food
system is falling apart.


15
00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.216
The truck drivers can't get in.

16
00:00:44.218 --> 00:00:48.113
We are going to have rioting
in the streets soon enough.


17
00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:49.803
Experts say
a third of the population


18
00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:51.458
on this planet will be infected,

19
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.010
and of that, 10%
to 20% will die.


20
00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.182
We're talking an estimate
of two to three million


21
00:00:56.184 --> 00:00:58.044
dead in this country
by Christmas.


22
00:00:58.046 --> 00:00:59.251
They played you all the same,

23
00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:02.044
the virus has all of
our services disrupted,


24
00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:05.078
and it is just as bad
all because those people-


25
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.596
- I would struggle to the ground

26
00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:09.354
trying to grab the
last gallons of milk.


27
00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:12.596
It's bad, people,
it's really bad.


28
00:01:12.598 --> 00:01:14.975
Some of them are
not even wearing masks.


29
00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:17.596
I think more of them
would care but they don't.


30
00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:19.561
This isn't
doom and gloom fake news.


31
00:01:19.563 --> 00:01:21.630
Unemployment is skyrocketing.

32
00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:23.872
The healthcare system is broken.

33
00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:25.941
This might be the end.

34
00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:28.768
The dead are piling
up in the hospitals.


35
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.216
We're gonna
run out of ventilators.


36
00:01:30.218 --> 00:01:31.458
We are
looking at a pandemic here


37
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.251
that will likely
stretch to years.


38
00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:33.630
Bodies in the streets,

39
00:01:33.632 --> 00:01:36.216
because we do not
know the severity.


40
00:01:36.218 --> 00:01:38.285
If there was ever
a time to panic, this is it.


41
00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:41.253
Welcome, America,
to the new normal.


42
00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:44.596
Picture this, two young
heroes down on their luck,


43
00:01:44.598 --> 00:01:47.216
COVID hits them and mm,
they lose everything.


44
00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:49.182
They're destitute,
they're unemployed.


45
00:01:49.184 --> 00:01:51.182
Audiences at home, they're
sitting there thinking,


46
00:01:51.184 --> 00:01:52.734
"I get this, I'm
feeling this, yo,


47
00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.044
they're sympathetic."

48
00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.078
So our two young heroes
go out and do something


49
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.389
they would normally never do.

50
00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:58.354
They become pandemic
journalists,


51
00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:00.010
only they're paid per click.

52
00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:02.699
So they start generating
ridiculous statistics and stories


53
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:05.147
and peddle fear to the
masses and it works so well,


54
00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.423
that they make a fortune
and buy an island.


55
00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:09.251
The problem is the world
is so caked in fear,


56
00:02:09.253 --> 00:02:10.699
that it goes Lord of the Flies.

57
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:11.837
But our two young
guys, you know,


58
00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.010
they're on the
beach in flip flops


59
00:02:13.012 --> 00:02:14.320
drinking umbrella drinks, right?

60
00:02:14.322 --> 00:02:17.354
One of them starts coughing, and

61
00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:19.285
oh man, he's got the 'rona!

62
00:02:19.287 --> 00:02:20.458
Turns out the whole thing

63
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.975
was a cautionary
tale the whole time!


64
00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:23.492
They should have just stayed
home with their families,


65
00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:24.630
you know, and
enjoyed the time off.


66
00:02:24.632 --> 00:02:25.805
They both die.

67
00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.803
Now, you give me
four to five weeks,


68
00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:33.044
micro budget, ample
crew members and cast,


69
00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:35.285
you know, we can turn this
around for AVOD, SVOD,


70
00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:36.527
whatever you need.

71
00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:37.768
The unions would
never go for it.


72
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.251
I'm sorry, Jack,

73
00:02:39.253 --> 00:02:41.665
but the entire film
industry is dead for now.


74
00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:42.734
It's just the way it is.

75
00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:44.147
For how long, Steve?

76
00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:46.147
Projections say it's
gonna take about six months


77
00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:47.458
for this to blow through.

78
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.010
Do you think I should
bring my dogs this time


79
00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:50.630
and keep them away from people?

80
00:02:50.632 --> 00:02:51.458
- Do they need a mask?
- Starting production


81
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.941
may be 2021.

82
00:02:52.943 --> 00:02:54.630
Steve, I can't
wait that long, man.


83
00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:55.941
The world may be closed down,

84
00:02:55.943 --> 00:02:57.941
but no one told my
mortgage company.


85
00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:01.216
Look, do you think
your call is the only one


86
00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:05.665
that I'm gonna have to
make like this today?


87
00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.322
Howdy, neighbor.

88
00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:15.699
Hey, Nerman.

89
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:17.389
What's up?

90
00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:19.632
Just being non-essential.

91
00:03:20.908 --> 00:03:24.012
Hey man, you got
toilet paper issues?


92
00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:26.354
What?

93
00:03:26.356 --> 00:03:28.010
We're collecting it
down at the mission


94
00:03:28.012 --> 00:03:29.182
for the needy people,

95
00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:32.010
what with the pandemic
and everything.


96
00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:33.182
I don't know.

97
00:03:33.184 --> 00:03:36.044
Me personally, I
always use baby wipes.


98
00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:37.699
You're not supposed
to do that, of course,


99
00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:40.736
it screws up the
pipes, but you know.


100
00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.665
No, I don't.

101
00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:44.908
Yeah, you do.

102
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.078
Anyways, I asked Miss
Carter up the street,


103
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.012
I asked Willie,
they were both out.


104
00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:56.492
Nerman, this is an
office parking lot, man.


105
00:03:56.494 --> 00:03:57.494
Yeah.

106
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.975
Your house is over there.

107
00:04:01.977 --> 00:04:02.977
Yeah.

108
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.458
You wanna go get
set up over there?


109
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.563
No, man, there's
no sun over there.


110
00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:13.423
Nerman, there's no sun here.

111
00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:14.770
There will be.

112
00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:19.216
Hey, you like my new cooler?

113
00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:21.113
Got it with my stimulus check.

114
00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:23.113
Also got a new gecko.

115
00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:24.770
Named him Mr. Gecko.

116
00:04:29.908 --> 00:04:31.527
You're not essential.

117
00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:33.010
Ouch.

118
00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:34.561
The governor's office says
you've gotta close down.


119
00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:38.665
Your business is basically
a giant Petri dish.


120
00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:41.389
In order to hashtag
flatten the curve,


121
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:44.184
businesses like
yours, cess pools,


122
00:04:45.598 --> 00:04:46.837
are going to have to close

123
00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:48.561
until we can get this
pandemic under control.


124
00:04:48.563 --> 00:04:51.768
Nobody is more of a
germaphobe than I am.


125
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.596
I was wearing PPEs before
all of this even happened.


126
00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:57.803
I've created a chart on how
to stay away from the virus


127
00:04:57.805 --> 00:05:01.492
and get the body that
you've always wanted.


128
00:05:01.494 --> 00:05:04.734
Step one, we're gonna
wear trash bags!


129
00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:06.458
We can throw them
away afterwards,


130
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.320
and they're good
for water weight.


131
00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:09.147
Step two-

132
00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:10.320
- I'm sorry.

133
00:05:10.322 --> 00:05:11.803
You have to close.

134
00:05:11.805 --> 00:05:13.354
It's for your safety.

135
00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:16.320
But shouldn't I get a chance
to decide what's safe for me?


136
00:05:16.322 --> 00:05:17.803
Oh please.

137
00:05:17.805 --> 00:05:20.216
You have to think about others.

138
00:05:20.218 --> 00:05:22.354
It's not about you, you know.

139
00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:23.975
Only essentials
are staying open.


140
00:05:23.977 --> 00:05:25.492
But I am essential.

141
00:05:25.494 --> 00:05:27.803
When people don't work out,
the muscle turns into fat.


142
00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:29.975
And when people get
fat, they get diabetes,


143
00:05:29.977 --> 00:05:31.665
and when they get diabetes,

144
00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:33.423
they flood the hospital systems.

145
00:05:33.425 --> 00:05:34.872
Think about it.

146
00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:39.147
Fitness instructors, we're
really in the line of fire here.


147
00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:41.977
I'm sorry, hashtag stay at home.

148
00:05:43.046 --> 00:05:45.147
We can beat this.

149
00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:46.975
But we all have to do our part.

150
00:05:46.977 --> 00:05:49.184
We're all in this together.

151
00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:55.768
Are we?

152
00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:01.941
Hey.

153
00:06:01.943 --> 00:06:03.113
How'd you go?

154
00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:06.216
Well, closed me down,
for my own safety.


155
00:06:06.218 --> 00:06:08.354
Oh, I'm sorry Dad.

156
00:06:08.356 --> 00:06:10.423
Well, at least I
won't get the virus.


157
00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:12.630
We can bring back Funday Monday.

158
00:06:12.632 --> 00:06:15.872
And, I've got something for us.

159
00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:16.699
Really?

160
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:18.285
What?

161
00:06:18.287 --> 00:06:19.837
Marbles!

162
00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.216
They came in the mail today.

163
00:06:21.218 --> 00:06:22.113
Marbles?

164
00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:23.630
Like the little kids' toy?

165
00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:26.630
Yeah, like a marble race.

166
00:06:26.632 --> 00:06:29.216
I saw it on YouTube,
it's awesome.


167
00:06:29.218 --> 00:06:31.874
So you just watch the marbles.

168
00:06:33.356 --> 00:06:37.078
Like, a marble race, you
watch 'em go down the hill.


169
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.561
Dad, I can't.

170
00:06:38.563 --> 00:06:40.458
I'm doing a watch party
tonight with my friends.


171
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.699
But, but you're not
supposed to go anywhere.


172
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:44.216
Everything is shut down.

173
00:06:44.218 --> 00:06:47.216
It's online, we're doing
it through a group meeting.


174
00:06:47.218 --> 00:06:48.527
That sounds like the worst.

175
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:50.354
It's being alone together.

176
00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:51.906
It's part of the fun.

177
00:06:51.908 --> 00:06:54.216
We can do your marble
thing another day.


178
00:06:54.218 --> 00:06:55.389
Marble race.

179
00:06:55.391 --> 00:06:56.699
Right.

180
00:06:56.701 --> 00:06:58.906
All right, well,

181
00:06:58.908 --> 00:07:01.458
see you when I get home.

182
00:07:12.494 --> 00:07:13.494
Oh no!

183
00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:36.182
Netflix isn't working.

184
00:07:36.184 --> 00:07:37.768
I know.

185
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.561
My students are gonna be
logging in in 10 minutes.


186
00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:40.941
Okay.

187
00:07:40.943 --> 00:07:42.596
Did you find my...

188
00:07:44.253 --> 00:07:45.285
We're not gonna
survive being locked up


189
00:07:45.287 --> 00:07:46.354
in here with these animals.

190
00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:47.667
I found these.

191
00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:51.010
Also, I told Uncle Bernie

192
00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.906
that you'd bring
him some groceries.


193
00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:54.113
Why?

194
00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:56.423
'Cause he's in the
vulnerable age group.


195
00:07:56.425 --> 00:08:00.458
I did make you some hand
sanitizer to take with you.


196
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:03.010
It's wonderful.

197
00:08:03.012 --> 00:08:04.010
So, Netflix.

198
00:08:04.012 --> 00:08:05.182
I canceled it.

199
00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:07.527
I'm canceling
anything, everything.


200
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:10.322
We're being hashtag
poor together.


201
00:08:26.494 --> 00:08:27.527
What are you doing?

202
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:28.665
What?

203
00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:29.630
Let's go!

204
00:08:29.632 --> 00:08:31.182
Invade Poland?

205
00:08:31.184 --> 00:08:32.389
It's a precaution.

206
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:33.354
Is that what you're calling it?

207
00:08:33.356 --> 00:08:34.251
That's not what I'm calling it.

208
00:08:34.253 --> 00:08:35.837
What are you calling it?

209
00:08:35.839 --> 00:08:36.630
I don't wanna say, don't
wanna hurt your feelings.


210
00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:37.632
Now Punch,

211
00:08:38.943 --> 00:08:41.458
you're in a car, man, and
I'm not a getaway driver.


212
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.941
Sure.

213
00:08:42.943 --> 00:08:46.320
They say that the virus is more
attracted to people like me.


214
00:08:46.322 --> 00:08:47.147
Big people?

215
00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:48.941
People born in July.

216
00:08:48.943 --> 00:08:51.837
They're saying, like, something
about summer month babies,


217
00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:55.423
and we have more pores,
and because of the heat.


218
00:08:55.425 --> 00:08:56.354
Okay, you know what?

219
00:08:56.356 --> 00:08:57.320
You see this?

220
00:08:57.322 --> 00:08:58.596
This is the problem right here.

221
00:08:58.598 --> 00:09:00.803
Dude, you don't
have any gloves on?


222
00:09:00.805 --> 00:09:01.975
- What is wrong with you?
- You know what?


223
00:09:01.977 --> 00:09:03.492
Look at you.

224
00:09:03.494 --> 00:09:04.941
- Stop it, stop it, stop it!
- Oh, you got the corona now?


225
00:09:04.943 --> 00:09:06.665
- You got the 'rona now!
- It's transmitted by touch,


226
00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:08.596
stop it, if it gets
into your orifices!


227
00:09:08.598 --> 00:09:09.906
Look at you!

228
00:09:09.908 --> 00:09:11.423
If anybody saw you like this-

229
00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:16.147
- You're crazy, you gotta
take the virus seriously, man!


230
00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:18.665
Katie made this from a
concoction of essential oils


231
00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:21.285
she got from that time she got
scammed by the church women.


232
00:09:21.287 --> 00:09:25.251
Kills everything,
viruses, bacteria, weeds.


233
00:09:25.253 --> 00:09:29.596
Put a little on my chest,
all the hair, gone.


234
00:09:29.598 --> 00:09:30.423
Want a feel?

235
00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:31.803
No, I'm good.

236
00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:33.078
She doesn't like it either.

237
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.906
Now please, get
in the front seat.


238
00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:41.805
Mask.

239
00:09:43.253 --> 00:09:46.389
There you go, not
about to go rob a bank.


240
00:09:46.391 --> 00:09:48.078
What's up, dude?

241
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.080
Really?

242
00:09:54.908 --> 00:09:56.630
If you're my getaway driver,

243
00:09:56.632 --> 00:09:58.285
what the heck are you
getting away from?


244
00:09:58.287 --> 00:10:00.561
Just give it a minute.

245
00:10:00.563 --> 00:10:02.906
Just gotta be finessed.

246
00:10:02.908 --> 00:10:05.078
Ah!

247
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.561
There we go, told you.

248
00:10:14.908 --> 00:10:16.975
Mom, you can't be serious.

249
00:10:16.977 --> 00:10:18.768
It's Tuesday.

250
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.803
It's the day I play bones,
and bones I shall play.


251
00:10:21.805 --> 00:10:23.596
But you're supposed
to stay at home.


252
00:10:23.598 --> 00:10:26.561
Everybody's supposed
to stay at home.


253
00:10:26.563 --> 00:10:28.320
You're supposed to
shelter in place.


254
00:10:28.322 --> 00:10:29.596
I'll be fine.

255
00:10:29.598 --> 00:10:32.630
Plus, I lost last
week to Queenie,


256
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.113
and you know I'm not gonna
let that happen again.


257
00:10:35.115 --> 00:10:39.010
Mom, you're at the
death age, you're over 60.


258
00:10:39.012 --> 00:10:41.010
They're saying that they won't
even treat you at hospitals.


259
00:10:41.012 --> 00:10:44.113
I'm going on my run,
then I'm gonna play bones,


260
00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:46.458
'cause it's Tuesday, and
that's what I do on Tuesdays,


261
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.320
and I'm not going to
live my life in fear.


262
00:10:49.322 --> 00:10:50.734
It's a pandemic, Mom.

263
00:10:50.736 --> 00:10:53.216
You should have
fear, it's healthy.


264
00:10:53.218 --> 00:10:55.492
I'm not afraid, I'm not.

265
00:10:55.494 --> 00:10:58.010
And you boys know why.

266
00:10:58.012 --> 00:10:59.699
- Don't say it.
- Because God


267
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.010
says not to fear.

268
00:11:01.012 --> 00:11:02.492
I'm trying to protect you.

269
00:11:02.494 --> 00:11:05.010
God is protecting me
right now, can't you see?


270
00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:07.941
Look what he's doing
already for me.


271
00:11:07.943 --> 00:11:08.975
I bought those!

272
00:11:08.977 --> 00:11:10.147
I helped.

273
00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:11.630
You're not supposed
to be outside,


274
00:11:11.632 --> 00:11:14.458
there's a pandemic,
and you might die.


275
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.941
To live in fear is a choice.

276
00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:19.113
Now, I'm gonna put
this things up,


277
00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:21.354
and then I'm heading
out to Queens,


278
00:11:21.356 --> 00:11:22.665
and that's the end of it.

279
00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:23.839
I have spoken.

280
00:11:27.425 --> 00:11:29.492
She's spoken.

281
00:11:29.494 --> 00:11:31.010
I'm going to Cabo.

282
00:11:31.012 --> 00:11:33.768
Uncle Bernie, you do know
that the world is closed.


283
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.010
The tickets cost $98.

284
00:11:35.012 --> 00:11:37.941
Because the world is closed.

285
00:11:37.943 --> 00:11:39.458
I'm retiring.

286
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.389
I bought six months of Cabo.

287
00:11:41.391 --> 00:11:44.699
After that, who
knows, maybe Florence.


288
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:45.665
Italy?

289
00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:47.320
You do know about Italy, right?

290
00:11:47.322 --> 00:11:49.492
I heard it's just beautiful.

291
00:11:49.494 --> 00:11:52.389
I'm gonna leave in four
weeks, which brings me to you.


292
00:11:52.391 --> 00:11:54.768
Katie said that
your job is caput.


293
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.320
That's a harsh word for it.

294
00:11:56.322 --> 00:11:58.768
Thing is, my business,
it's not the kinda thing


295
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.389
I can just walk away from.

296
00:12:00.391 --> 00:12:02.044
I got a lot
of balls in the air.

297
00:12:02.046 --> 00:12:03.699
I want you to take over.

298
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:06.561
You can use Punch here
until he gets a real job.


299
00:12:06.563 --> 00:12:09.113
I do have a job, I'm
a fitness instructor.


300
00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:10.872
What happened to
the doctor thing?


301
00:12:10.874 --> 00:12:12.874
Physical therapy, and,

302
00:12:15.012 --> 00:12:17.216
I didn't make it.

303
00:12:17.218 --> 00:12:19.699
Punchy can't do blood.

304
00:12:22.356 --> 00:12:23.837
Well, okay.

305
00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:26.182
You can sell, Punch'll
be the muscle.


306
00:12:26.184 --> 00:12:28.908
What exactly is it that you do?

307
00:12:38.908 --> 00:12:43.078
He's a hit man, Uncle
Bernie's a hit man.


308
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.010
Boys, I'm an arms dealer.

309
00:12:46.012 --> 00:12:47.423
So, illegal?

310
00:12:47.425 --> 00:12:50.768
Privatized gun
shows, it's a service.


311
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.285
Take this gun right here.

312
00:12:53.287 --> 00:12:55.630
It's a Cobalt, nine millimeter.

313
00:12:55.632 --> 00:12:58.941
6.1 inch barrel, five and
a half pound trigger pull.


314
00:12:58.943 --> 00:13:01.458
That'll run you up $600
at a typical gun show.


315
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.147
Why?

316
00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:07.147
Clean, off the books,
not captured on any cameras anywhere.


317
00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:10.941
To the right buyer, that thing
is worth a couple of grand.


318
00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:14.803
So that's what I do.

319
00:13:14.805 --> 00:13:16.458
I host gun shows
for those people.


320
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.460
Just privately, to order,

321
00:13:19.977 --> 00:13:21.941
out of the back of my car.

322
00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:25.285
And it's not illegal,
I'm registered.


323
00:13:25.287 --> 00:13:27.458
I got it from the same
site I was ordained


324
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.113
as a minister so I
could do weddings.


325
00:13:29.115 --> 00:13:31.941
So, are all these
boxes filled with guns?


326
00:13:31.943 --> 00:13:34.458
No, don't be silly,
I'm an entrepreneur.


327
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.492
First sign of trouble over
in Wuhan, I bought up.


328
00:13:38.494 --> 00:13:41.977
Boys, you got toilet
paper, masks, gloves,


329
00:13:43.632 --> 00:13:46.805
hand sanitizer, PPE,
the whole shebang.


330
00:13:48.632 --> 00:13:50.354
The street market
value of this stuff


331
00:13:50.356 --> 00:13:52.768
is 400% to 800% above market.

332
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.010
He's one of the crazy people

333
00:13:54.012 --> 00:13:56.354
that bought up all
the toilet paper.


334
00:13:56.356 --> 00:13:59.492
Uncle Bernie, are you
scalping toilet paper


335
00:13:59.494 --> 00:14:00.837
on the internet?

336
00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.837
No, of course not,
don't be ridiculous.


337
00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:04.182
That's good.

338
00:14:04.184 --> 00:14:06.010
I sell to the dealers,

339
00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:08.251
they scalp the stuff
on the internet.


340
00:14:08.253 --> 00:14:10.492
That's not better.

341
00:14:10.494 --> 00:14:13.527
They're getting $5 a roll,

342
00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:15.044
and that's after shipping.

343
00:14:15.046 --> 00:14:17.561
Between what I've got
here and my storage unit,


344
00:14:17.563 --> 00:14:20.805
I've got 18,000 rolls,
you do the math.


345
00:14:24.046 --> 00:14:28.044
Six feet, six feet,
that's not six feet.


346
00:14:28.046 --> 00:14:30.354
I've got somebody else
I can go to with this,


347
00:14:30.356 --> 00:14:31.872
but things being what they are,

348
00:14:31.874 --> 00:14:33.527
you might not work for months,

349
00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:36.354
and you've got all those
kids to think about.


350
00:14:36.356 --> 00:14:40.182
You're my nephew, I wanna
keep it in the family.


351
00:14:40.184 --> 00:14:45.010
And these guns here, well,
they'll never go out of business.


352
00:14:45.012 --> 00:14:47.423
You should think about it.

353
00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:53.837
All these boxes are from China,

354
00:14:53.839 --> 00:14:56.012
where the virus came from.

355
00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:09.115
Daddy, I have some bad news.

356
00:15:11.425 --> 00:15:13.078
The zombie ducks are coming

357
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.803
and I don't think
you will make it.


358
00:15:19.115 --> 00:15:20.320
Where do you see yourself
in the next five years?


359
00:15:20.322 --> 00:15:22.113
I don't care if you feel good,

360
00:15:22.115 --> 00:15:24.906
you cannot get, you cannot
be without your pants.


361
00:15:24.908 --> 00:15:26.216
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry,


362
00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:27.768
I didn't hear you,
can you redo that?


363
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.078
It's not right.

364
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.941
Excuse me, how do I
get my email address?


365
00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:32.906
Yeah, guys, I'm
getting a really bad connection.


366
00:15:32.908 --> 00:15:34.078
I'm sorry, I didn't get that,

367
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.734
can you mute the other people?

368
00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:38.046
So, mute everyone else, I-

369
00:15:39.253 --> 00:15:41.078
- I think you
muted yourself, Cady.


370
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.941
Your mouth is moving, but-

371
00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:44.975
Hiya, so sorry people,

372
00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:46.492
I think I did the wrong-

373
00:15:46.494 --> 00:15:49.630
- You're the admin, so you
have to mute the people.


374
00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:51.046
Hiya, hi there.

375
00:15:52.977 --> 00:15:54.596
Hi, hey.

376
00:15:54.598 --> 00:15:56.078
Go get your pants on, Constance.

377
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.320
You can mute the other people

378
00:15:57.322 --> 00:15:59.389
in the group, all of them.

379
00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:00.803
I'm new to this
whole online thing.


380
00:16:00.805 --> 00:16:02.458
Do not grab yourself like that!

381
00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.975
So, is this
the jiu jitsu meeting?


382
00:16:03.977 --> 00:16:07.492
So, like, how are we
supposed to run around?


383
00:16:07.494 --> 00:16:10.354
They'll get hot and
stuff with the masks on,


384
00:16:10.356 --> 00:16:12.285
it's like, super hot in there-

385
00:16:12.287 --> 00:16:13.527
- Okay, I'm not-

386
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:15.596
Goodbye.

387
00:16:15.598 --> 00:16:16.803
Howdy, neighbor.

388
00:16:16.805 --> 00:16:17.975
Wondered if you
would like to support


389
00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:19.977
your healthcare workers.

390
00:16:21.012 --> 00:16:22.975
Yeah, why not, why not?

391
00:16:22.977 --> 00:16:25.012
Just stick it over there.

392
00:16:30.943 --> 00:16:32.492
That looks pretty
good now, don't it?


393
00:16:32.494 --> 00:16:34.492
It looks wonderful.

394
00:16:34.494 --> 00:16:36.147
It looks amazing.

395
00:16:36.149 --> 00:16:37.805
That'll be 30 bucks.

396
00:16:38.874 --> 00:16:40.147
30 bucks?

397
00:16:40.149 --> 00:16:41.320
I don't care about the
nurses that much, man.


398
00:16:41.322 --> 00:16:43.113
Don't say that.

399
00:16:43.115 --> 00:16:45.492
It might come down to
you, one other patient,


400
00:16:45.494 --> 00:16:47.113
and one ventilator,

401
00:16:47.115 --> 00:16:49.010
and who do you think's
gonna make that call?


402
00:16:49.012 --> 00:16:51.147
They ain't gonna
choose you, man.


403
00:16:51.149 --> 00:16:54.044
They're gonna let you die.

404
00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:56.458
30 bucks looks pretty good now.

405
00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.389
Okay.

406
00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:04.839
Daddy, why are
you wearing a mask?


407
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.596
Well buddy, because I have to.

408
00:17:10.598 --> 00:17:12.423
Because they make
me, but don't worry,


409
00:17:12.425 --> 00:17:13.699
we're flattening
the curve together,


410
00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:14.906
it'll only take
a few more weeks.


411
00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:17.872
Daddy, can we please
do zombie ducks now?


412
00:17:17.874 --> 00:17:19.561
Buddy, now is not the best time.

413
00:17:19.563 --> 00:17:22.527
Zombie ducks never
come at a good time.


414
00:17:22.529 --> 00:17:24.908
That's what makes them scary.

415
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.874
Pete, I thought you
said you had a gym.


416
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.734
I do.

417
00:17:42.736 --> 00:17:46.561
This is it, I bought
it off the internet.


418
00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:53.492
Dave, what are you doing?

419
00:17:53.494 --> 00:17:55.596
Thrust squats.

420
00:17:57.632 --> 00:17:58.975
That's not a thing.

421
00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:00.527
Oh yeah it is.

422
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:03.046
It burns, it burns really good.

423
00:18:08.115 --> 00:18:09.941
Billy, what?

424
00:18:09.943 --> 00:18:11.113
Why aren't you dressed?

425
00:18:11.115 --> 00:18:12.975
I haven't seen
anybody in 10 days.


426
00:18:12.977 --> 00:18:15.147
I'm stuck in this house.

427
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:17.665
I thought maybe you could hang
out for a while, you know?


428
00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:20.251
I mean, we could
sit on the couch,


429
00:18:20.253 --> 00:18:22.460
watch a movie or something.

430
00:18:23.494 --> 00:18:26.046
I feel really lonely, you know?

431
00:18:27.287 --> 00:18:30.943
10 feet times 100
pounds every 10 seconds?


432
00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:39.046
That is not making any sense.

433
00:18:40.253 --> 00:18:43.699
So how long's the
virus gonna go on?


434
00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:45.837
That's the million
dollar question, buddy.


435
00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:46.839
PTUs?

436
00:18:48.184 --> 00:18:53.149
If it goes on for a long
time, will you run outta money?


437
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.354
No buddy, we're gonna be fine.

438
00:18:56.356 --> 00:18:59.012
We're gonna be fine, I promise.

439
00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:03.665
I think that you're gonna
have to just read this


440
00:19:03.667 --> 00:19:05.736
and try to figure it out.

441
00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:13.492
I'm thinking about it.

442
00:19:13.494 --> 00:19:14.941
I don't know, man.

443
00:19:14.943 --> 00:19:18.216
I can make it six weeks
before I'm outta cash.


444
00:19:18.218 --> 00:19:20.527
I think it's time for
extraordinary options.


445
00:19:20.529 --> 00:19:22.354
The whole point is
to stay in the house


446
00:19:22.356 --> 00:19:23.872
and don't get sick.

447
00:19:23.874 --> 00:19:25.699
Are you seriously worried
about the virus right now?


448
00:19:25.701 --> 00:19:26.665
Yeah!

449
00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:27.803
Are you not watching the news?

450
00:19:27.805 --> 00:19:29.596
No, I'm not watching the news,

451
00:19:29.598 --> 00:19:31.182
they're making a
killing off this.


452
00:19:31.184 --> 00:19:34.044
Never trust anybody
peddling fear


453
00:19:34.046 --> 00:19:35.527
if they're making
money off of it.


454
00:19:35.529 --> 00:19:37.596
Man, they say it can
last in the air for like,


455
00:19:37.598 --> 00:19:41.354
two hours, or four
hours, or even days.


456
00:19:41.356 --> 00:19:43.010
That it likes moisture,

457
00:19:43.012 --> 00:19:45.078
but thrives off of
dry environments.


458
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.182
Okay, forget about
the virus, man!


459
00:19:48.184 --> 00:19:50.975
I'm gonna be broke and
destitute with five kids to feed


460
00:19:50.977 --> 00:19:53.010
before this things
works itself out.


461
00:19:53.012 --> 00:19:55.906
Dude, what could
possibly go wrong?


462
00:19:55.908 --> 00:19:58.837
We could die, we
could go to jail,


463
00:19:58.839 --> 00:20:02.354
we could get arrested,
we could lose everything,


464
00:20:02.356 --> 00:20:03.736
and we could die.

465
00:20:04.805 --> 00:20:06.665
But seriously.

466
00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:09.147
We could die, we
could go to jail,


467
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:12.389
we could get arrested,
we could lose everything,


468
00:20:12.391 --> 00:20:13.805
and we could die.

469
00:20:16.736 --> 00:20:18.527
Yeah, but come on.

470
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:21.216
Hey, um, I'm
really gonna have to cancel


471
00:20:21.218 --> 00:20:22.354
the marble race tonight.

472
00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:24.182
Oh, okay, that's no big deal.

473
00:20:24.184 --> 00:20:28.872
But hey, me and you,
tomorrow though, I promise.


474
00:20:28.874 --> 00:20:30.216
Mm hmm.

475
00:20:30.218 --> 00:20:32.044
It's a date, and
I won't be late.


476
00:20:32.046 --> 00:20:33.046
Okay.

477
00:20:36.322 --> 00:20:38.667
Okay boys, rule number one.

478
00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:41.492
Don't get shot.

479
00:20:41.494 --> 00:20:45.078
This applies to guns
and hand sanitizers.


480
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.389
Oh, and by the way, side
rule, always wear gloves.


481
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:53.216
You don't wanna get your
skin oils on the merchandise.


482
00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:56.010
I can see Punch is already
good with this one.


483
00:20:56.012 --> 00:20:57.906
It's for the virus.

484
00:20:57.908 --> 00:21:00.113
We don't wanna catch a cold.

485
00:21:00.115 --> 00:21:00.872
COVID.

486
00:21:00.874 --> 00:21:01.874
Bless you.

487
00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:07.423
Rule number two, always
meet in a public place.


488
00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:11.320
Now, this may seem
counterintuitive,


489
00:21:11.322 --> 00:21:13.803
but you're a lot less likely
to break rule number one


490
00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:16.046
when there's people around.

491
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.012
Rule number three, you walk
at the first sign of trouble.


492
00:21:30.253 --> 00:21:31.044
The hair stands up on
the back of your neck,


493
00:21:31.046 --> 00:21:32.598
you leave, no sale.

494
00:21:34.115 --> 00:21:37.078
And the most important rule,
don't forget rule number one.


495
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.734
How do we know that this
guy's not some crazy person?


496
00:21:39.736 --> 00:21:42.320
I only deal with
people that I know,


497
00:21:42.322 --> 00:21:46.147
and referrals that
have the password.


498
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:48.734
If they don't know
it, I don't deal,


499
00:21:48.736 --> 00:21:51.287
which now means you don't deal.

500
00:21:55.425 --> 00:21:57.285
I cannot believe
we are doing this


501
00:21:57.287 --> 00:21:59.458
in a church parking lot.

502
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.492
It's a Thursday.

503
00:22:01.494 --> 00:22:03.529
Wait, this is a church?

504
00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:08.596
I think I'm gonna spray him.

505
00:22:08.598 --> 00:22:09.527
No.

506
00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:12.115
I think I'm gonna do it, yeah.

507
00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:16.665
Good evening, welcome
to the gun show.


508
00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:19.492
Please note my license,
it's a legal thing,


509
00:22:19.494 --> 00:22:21.010
so forth, so such.

510
00:22:21.012 --> 00:22:24.320
We've got some state guidelines
for social gathering,


511
00:22:24.322 --> 00:22:26.389
the old section 418.

512
00:22:26.391 --> 00:22:28.147
He could have been anywhere.

513
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:29.630
Okay.

514
00:22:29.632 --> 00:22:32.975
Uncle Bernie's is officially
open for business.


515
00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:35.147
For the next 20 minutes.

516
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:36.492
Fine.

517
00:22:36.494 --> 00:22:39.320
I need to sanitize you.

518
00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:52.492
Jasmine?

519
00:22:52.494 --> 00:22:55.044
No, it's actually
cherry blossom.


520
00:22:55.046 --> 00:22:56.354
Nice.

521
00:22:56.356 --> 00:22:58.908
So, what are we
looking for today?


522
00:23:00.667 --> 00:23:01.872
Something for my wife.

523
00:23:01.874 --> 00:23:03.667
Is it her birthday?

524
00:23:04.529 --> 00:23:05.529
No.

525
00:23:09.218 --> 00:23:12.874
This is the Colt 1911,
.45, semi automatic,


526
00:23:14.805 --> 00:23:18.113
single stack, six
rounds in the magazine,


527
00:23:18.115 --> 00:23:20.561
and, well, one in the hole

528
00:23:20.563 --> 00:23:22.872
if your gut tells you
that you're gonna need it.


529
00:23:22.874 --> 00:23:25.527
If you can't get the
job done with this,


530
00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:27.389
probably shouldn't
be doing the job.


531
00:23:27.391 --> 00:23:28.527
Is it loud?

532
00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:30.906
Well, loud, how do you mean?

533
00:23:30.908 --> 00:23:32.561
I don't want the
people calling the cops,


534
00:23:32.563 --> 00:23:36.113
I don't want the neighbors
hearing and asking questions.


535
00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:38.803
My wife has sensitive ears.

536
00:23:38.805 --> 00:23:41.770
Well, this one
won't go unnoticed.


537
00:23:42.943 --> 00:23:45.113
If you're looking
for something quiet,


538
00:23:45.115 --> 00:23:49.906
I've got this nine millimeter,
it attaches to this.


539
00:23:49.908 --> 00:23:53.078
Now, it's only good
for a couple of rounds,


540
00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.561
it's nothing longterm.

541
00:23:54.563 --> 00:23:56.251
That's gonna cost
you a little extra.


542
00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.770
What the...

543
00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:09.598
Yeah.

544
00:24:10.908 --> 00:24:12.837
How many rounds do I have?

545
00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:17.078
Standard mag, one in
the chamber, 17 rounds.


546
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.632
Ah, no, so close!

547
00:24:21.736 --> 00:24:23.460
It was almost enough.

548
00:24:26.253 --> 00:24:28.908
So why do you wanna buy a gun?

549
00:24:31.425 --> 00:24:32.975
Coyotes.

550
00:24:32.977 --> 00:24:34.492
Coyotes?

551
00:24:34.494 --> 00:24:36.803
Yeah, coyotes, sometimes
they come into the yard


552
00:24:36.805 --> 00:24:38.665
and mess up the
vegetable garden.


553
00:24:38.667 --> 00:24:43.080
I wasn't really aware that
we had a coyote problem.


554
00:24:44.287 --> 00:24:46.425
All right, I'll take it.

555
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:48.320
Great.

556
00:24:48.322 --> 00:24:50.391
Oh, oh, you also get this.

557
00:24:51.598 --> 00:24:53.078
It's a free gift.

558
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:03.561
You have a tarp
and shovel in your trunk.


559
00:25:03.563 --> 00:25:04.665
And tape.

560
00:25:04.667 --> 00:25:05.492
And tape.

561
00:25:05.494 --> 00:25:06.354
And a rope.

562
00:25:06.356 --> 00:25:08.561
Yep, I see that.

563
00:25:08.563 --> 00:25:10.044
Yeah, and they had
me standing in line


564
00:25:10.046 --> 00:25:12.527
for over an hour just to get in.

565
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:14.527
All these people
hacking everywhere,


566
00:25:14.529 --> 00:25:16.354
then they put these
six foot markers down,


567
00:25:16.356 --> 00:25:18.527
I'm like, "This
is a free country."


568
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:21.458
I can stand where I wanna stand.

569
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.805
"Try to stop me."

570
00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:28.012
Then, they only let me
buy one of everything.


571
00:25:28.977 --> 00:25:30.356
I'm like, "What?"

572
00:25:32.356 --> 00:25:36.044
Like I'm hording
shovels or something.


573
00:25:36.046 --> 00:25:38.837
How many,

574
00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:41.046
how many tarps do you need?

575
00:25:49.012 --> 00:25:50.839
As many as it takes.

576
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.078
Pleasure doing
business with you.


577
00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.423
You two don't go losing it now.

578
00:25:57.425 --> 00:25:59.216
You don't know what
that guy's gonna do,


579
00:25:59.218 --> 00:26:00.975
and most likely, he's
gonna do nothing.


580
00:26:00.977 --> 00:26:04.251
Did you not just
see him acting out?


581
00:26:04.253 --> 00:26:06.805
Shooting everything, all of it!

582
00:26:08.391 --> 00:26:09.768
What, the coyotes?

583
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.389
There are no coyotes!

584
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:12.736
Not in this area!

585
00:26:13.598 --> 00:26:15.701
And he bought a silencer.

586
00:26:17.115 --> 00:26:19.596
We're gonna end up
on Dateline, man.


587
00:26:19.598 --> 00:26:22.837
Boys, look, it's a part
of the business, okay?


588
00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:26.596
You don't assume anything,
and don't ask any questions.


589
00:26:26.598 --> 00:26:28.389
If he doesn't buy
the gun from us,


590
00:26:28.391 --> 00:26:29.975
he'll just buy it
from somebody else.


591
00:26:29.977 --> 00:26:32.078
We just provide a service.

592
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.906
Legal or not, I just
don't feel comfortable


593
00:26:34.908 --> 00:26:36.423
selling guns like this.

594
00:26:36.425 --> 00:26:39.492
Well, if you guys feel a
little softy about the guns,


595
00:26:39.494 --> 00:26:41.906
just focus on the
PPE and the lotions,


596
00:26:41.908 --> 00:26:43.492
and then if you need the money,

597
00:26:43.494 --> 00:26:45.906
well, the guns will
always be there.


598
00:26:45.908 --> 00:26:47.768
That's all there is
to it, gentlemen.


599
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.147
Quick and easy, no mess.

600
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:52.665
Oh, I think there's
gonna be a mess somewhere.


601
00:26:52.667 --> 00:26:55.906
Look at it this way, you
both made a G, didn't ya?


602
00:26:55.908 --> 00:26:57.423
Here's the phone.

603
00:26:57.425 --> 00:27:02.285
If somebody calls, make sure
they have the password, Chambo.


604
00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:05.770
You just follow the
rules, you'll be fine.


605
00:27:09.805 --> 00:27:14.113
First time
jitters, I remember them.


606
00:27:14.115 --> 00:27:16.147
Never eat tuna before a deal.

607
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:17.149
Oh man.

608
00:27:44.874 --> 00:27:46.147
What are you doing?

609
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:47.768
I'm marking the floor, you know,

610
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.182
how they do at
the grocery store.


611
00:27:49.184 --> 00:27:51.320
Are you gonna turn
my garage one way


612
00:27:51.322 --> 00:27:52.803
and put up a bunch of signs?

613
00:27:52.805 --> 00:27:54.734
'Cause the virus, it can read

614
00:27:54.736 --> 00:27:55.975
and runs around
carrying a tape measure.


615
00:27:55.977 --> 00:27:57.734
I am being a responsible adult.

616
00:27:57.736 --> 00:27:59.010
Is that what you're calling it?

617
00:27:59.012 --> 00:28:01.216
It's not what I'm calling it.

618
00:28:01.218 --> 00:28:02.561
Okay.

619
00:28:02.563 --> 00:28:06.872
Now, I calculated I
need at least 50 grand


620
00:28:06.874 --> 00:28:07.872
to make it through a year.

621
00:28:07.874 --> 00:28:09.389
What do you need?

622
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:12.216
About the same, I gotta
pay Aaliyah's tuition.


623
00:28:12.218 --> 00:28:14.941
That's 100, say 50
grand for contingencies,


624
00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:17.044
so we're looking at 150 grand.

625
00:28:17.046 --> 00:28:19.770
We get 1150 grand,
and we're out.


626
00:28:25.908 --> 00:28:26.872
Yes.

627
00:28:26.874 --> 00:28:28.182
Why'd you draw it like that?

628
00:28:28.184 --> 00:28:29.423
It's a thermometer.

629
00:28:29.425 --> 00:28:30.768
For sick people.

630
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.251
You need to change it,
it looks like an omen.


631
00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:34.253
Okay.

632
00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:39.837
Feel better?

633
00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:41.044
Not at all!

634
00:28:41.046 --> 00:28:43.010
Now it just looks like
a demon thermometer.


635
00:28:43.012 --> 00:28:44.561
It's a rocket ship, man.

636
00:28:44.563 --> 00:28:46.665
Is it crashing?

637
00:28:49.874 --> 00:28:51.253
It's the phone.

638
00:28:55.012 --> 00:28:55.906
Hello?

639
00:28:55.908 --> 00:28:57.078
Chambo.

640
00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.320
Esse, what you got for me, man?

641
00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:01.494
It has begun.

642
00:30:02.012 --> 00:30:03.458
It's so hot.

643
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.391
I can't see
anything outta these.


644
00:30:07.287 --> 00:30:08.596
Oh yeah.

645
00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:09.598
You ready?

646
00:30:10.736 --> 00:30:12.389
Yeah, I'm ready.

647
00:30:12.391 --> 00:30:14.010
Are you ready?

648
00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:16.458
Yeah, I'm ready, why
would I not be ready?


649
00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.941
Are you not ready?

650
00:30:17.943 --> 00:30:19.872
No, I'm ready.

651
00:30:19.874 --> 00:30:22.527
It was just courtesy, I
was just checking with you.


652
00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:25.389
I mean, when you
say it like that...


653
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:26.975
Like what?

654
00:30:26.977 --> 00:30:28.147
Doubtful.

655
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:29.354
What?

656
00:30:29.356 --> 00:30:30.768
Yeah, you had
doubt in your voice.


657
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:32.078
No.

658
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.941
Yeah, like the
doubt in your voice,


659
00:30:33.943 --> 00:30:36.010
the tone went down
just a little bit.


660
00:30:36.012 --> 00:30:37.492
No, there's no doubt,

661
00:30:37.494 --> 00:30:39.596
that's just how my
voice sounds sometimes.


662
00:30:39.598 --> 00:30:40.872
See?

663
00:30:40.874 --> 00:30:42.354
Your voice is just,
like, fluctuating.


664
00:30:43.943 --> 00:30:46.837
There's no fluctuating.

665
00:30:46.839 --> 00:30:48.423
Just sounds
doubtful, that's all.


666
00:30:48.425 --> 00:30:49.665
There's no doubt.

667
00:30:49.667 --> 00:30:51.941
I am cool, I am
super cool, okay?


668
00:30:51.943 --> 00:30:54.458
Nothing to worry about
here, are you cool?


669
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.596
Yeah, I'm cool.

670
00:30:55.598 --> 00:30:57.113
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- Okay.


671
00:30:57.115 --> 00:30:59.460
Well then, I think we're go.

672
00:31:00.391 --> 00:31:01.391
I agree.

673
00:31:02.356 --> 00:31:06.389
I also agree with that
as well, so let's go.


674
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:17.561
You know, Uncle Bernie said

675
00:31:17.563 --> 00:31:19.078
to meet in a public place.

676
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.975
This is a public place.

677
00:31:20.977 --> 00:31:23.078
Dude, there is nobody out here.

678
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.906
The world's quarantined,
man, there's nobody anywhere.


679
00:31:26.908 --> 00:31:28.527
This is the type of
place you get killed


680
00:31:28.529 --> 00:31:30.044
and thrown in a dumpster.

681
00:31:30.046 --> 00:31:32.182
Don't be ridiculous, man,
that would never happen.


682
00:31:32.184 --> 00:31:34.078
We're way too heavy.

683
00:31:36.184 --> 00:31:37.494
What do you see?

684
00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:40.596
Dude, put your glasses on.

685
00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:42.527
I can't, man, they
look ridiculous,


686
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:45.561
he'd never take me seriously.

687
00:31:45.563 --> 00:31:47.216
You be my eyes.

688
00:31:47.218 --> 00:31:48.389
That's insane.

689
00:31:48.391 --> 00:31:49.906
Punch, please.

690
00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:50.908
Okay.

691
00:31:51.908 --> 00:31:55.010
All right, it's a
guy, Latino looking.


692
00:31:55.012 --> 00:31:57.251
Yeah, that sounds like him.

693
00:31:57.253 --> 00:32:00.975
Okay, so what is the
plan if things go south?


694
00:32:00.977 --> 00:32:03.078
Run fast I guess.

695
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.561
Your plan is run?

696
00:32:04.563 --> 00:32:05.805
No, run fast.

697
00:32:07.805 --> 00:32:10.943
I'm a lot faster
than you, so keep up.


698
00:32:19.874 --> 00:32:21.423
Er, you Hector?

699
00:32:21.425 --> 00:32:23.251
Where's the old man?

700
00:32:23.253 --> 00:32:24.253
He retired.

701
00:32:25.391 --> 00:32:27.701
So like, how does this work?

702
00:32:28.736 --> 00:32:30.596
You show me what you got.

703
00:32:30.598 --> 00:32:32.872
If I like what
you got, I buy it.


704
00:32:32.874 --> 00:32:34.561
That seems pretty straight up.

705
00:32:34.563 --> 00:32:36.423
Yeah, that sounds good.

706
00:32:36.425 --> 00:32:38.147
Dude, he's got backup.

707
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:41.596
A little kid just came out,
hairs on my neck just went up.


708
00:32:41.598 --> 00:32:43.734
Dude, chill, it's
okay, we got backup too.


709
00:32:43.736 --> 00:32:45.389
We do?

710
00:32:45.391 --> 00:32:46.561
Who?

711
00:32:46.563 --> 00:32:47.492
You.

712
00:32:47.494 --> 00:32:49.874
So, hey, what's with the kid?

713
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.389
Yeah, sorry about that.

714
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:55.216
Kid's with me for a night.

715
00:32:55.218 --> 00:32:58.147
He was at home all day
playing video games,


716
00:32:58.149 --> 00:33:00.527
so I told him, "There's no way"

717
00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:03.182
you're gonna stay there
playing video games!"


718
00:33:03.184 --> 00:33:04.975
I told him he needed
to come spend some time


719
00:33:04.977 --> 00:33:07.320
with his dad, some bonding time.

720
00:33:37.598 --> 00:33:38.598
Si, Papa.

721
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:43.839
Anyway, are we gonna
do this thing or what?


722
00:33:45.874 --> 00:33:48.012
Did you get any of that?

723
00:33:59.701 --> 00:34:01.701
It's single ply, amigo.

724
00:34:03.253 --> 00:34:05.492
I can do $20 a roll.

725
00:34:05.494 --> 00:34:06.975
30.

726
00:34:06.977 --> 00:34:10.356
It's single ply, amigo,
and it's really rough.


727
00:34:13.218 --> 00:34:15.423
Some people are sensitive.

728
00:34:15.425 --> 00:34:17.630
But it's industrial grade.

729
00:34:17.632 --> 00:34:19.354
It's three times longer
than your normal roll.


730
00:34:19.356 --> 00:34:20.941
Plus, just think,

731
00:34:20.943 --> 00:34:24.596
you could make an extra four
or five bucks as shipping.


732
00:34:24.598 --> 00:34:26.354
All right.

733
00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:27.356
Okay.

734
00:34:28.425 --> 00:34:30.216
Gimme 200 rolls of
the toilet paper.


735
00:34:30.218 --> 00:34:32.356
I want 100 boxes of masks,

736
00:34:34.218 --> 00:34:36.665
and 20 of those
wipies over there.


737
00:34:36.667 --> 00:34:38.667
All in all, it's $4,200.

738
00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:43.768
Yeah, deal.

739
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.630
The plague!

740
00:34:46.632 --> 00:34:51.012
You guys can air high five,
or even head nod, like this.


741
00:34:54.529 --> 00:34:56.561
Woo!

742
00:34:56.563 --> 00:34:57.563
$4,200!

743
00:34:58.598 --> 00:35:00.251
- Oh hoo hoo, mamma!
- Yes!


744
00:35:00.253 --> 00:35:01.458
Oh my god.

745
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.113
If you had ever
told me that the world


746
00:35:03.115 --> 00:35:05.285
would go this crazy
over toilet paper,


747
00:35:05.287 --> 00:35:06.941
I would have said you were nuts.

748
00:35:06.943 --> 00:35:08.147
Cuckoo, you know?

749
00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:09.941
Oh my god, we gotta celebrate.

750
00:35:09.943 --> 00:35:11.147
Heck yeah, man, where we going?

751
00:35:11.149 --> 00:35:11.975
Guess!

752
00:35:11.977 --> 00:35:12.941
Where we going?

753
00:35:12.943 --> 00:35:14.080
Ha ha! Um...

754
00:35:18.667 --> 00:35:19.667
Um, huh.

755
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:23.770
Er...

756
00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:26.425
Er...

757
00:35:31.287 --> 00:35:33.425
The world's closed, man.

758
00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:38.287
Hey, do you think
Walmart's open?


759
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.147
$4,200.

760
00:35:44.149 --> 00:35:45.975
Let's do the marble race
later this afternoon.


761
00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:48.941
I can't, I've got to do these
online lectures for school.


762
00:35:48.943 --> 00:35:50.010
Why not tonight?

763
00:35:50.012 --> 00:35:52.285
Well, I can't, I gotta work.

764
00:35:52.287 --> 00:35:54.010
Your work is closed.

765
00:35:54.012 --> 00:35:55.665
Everyone's work is closed.

766
00:35:55.667 --> 00:35:58.630
Well, I got a new gig,
it's time sensitive.


767
00:35:58.632 --> 00:36:00.147
Okay.

768
00:36:00.149 --> 00:36:01.216
You know, I really wanna
do this with you, all right?


769
00:36:01.218 --> 00:36:03.665
So we'll do it later.

770
00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:06.012
Okay, I gotta go, I love you.

771
00:36:13.218 --> 00:36:14.630
I can't find any.

772
00:36:14.632 --> 00:36:16.147
What?

773
00:36:16.149 --> 00:36:19.010
I can't find any,
I think we're out.


774
00:36:19.012 --> 00:36:20.218
Are you sure?

775
00:36:31.149 --> 00:36:32.632
Nope, we're out.

776
00:36:34.046 --> 00:36:36.322
What am I supposed to do?

777
00:36:43.908 --> 00:36:46.010
You're gonna have to
get creative, Steve.


778
00:36:46.012 --> 00:36:47.354
What does that mean?

779
00:36:47.356 --> 00:36:50.078
Do I have to spell
it out for you, Steve?


780
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.322
Or do you wanna experiment?

781
00:36:59.287 --> 00:37:00.287
Buy now.

782
00:37:04.218 --> 00:37:05.285
Yes.

783
00:37:05.287 --> 00:37:06.287
Hectorzita!

784
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:28.078
Yes!

785
00:37:32.908 --> 00:37:34.561
It's a waste of a
perfectly good pandemic


786
00:37:34.563 --> 00:37:35.906
if you aren't around for it!

787
00:37:39.632 --> 00:37:41.147
Schools are closed right now.

788
00:37:41.149 --> 00:37:42.975
Do you know what
they have me doing?


789
00:37:42.977 --> 00:37:44.216
Huh?

790
00:37:44.218 --> 00:37:45.803
Math.

791
00:37:45.805 --> 00:37:47.078
Math!

792
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.768
Do you know what the
problem with that is?


793
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.975
Do you know how many
changes they've made?


794
00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:53.078
It makes me wanna go right
back across the border.


795
00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.941
Do you know why?

796
00:37:55.943 --> 00:37:58.872
Because over there, they
don't change anything.


797
00:37:58.874 --> 00:38:02.805
It is consistent, like
us, consistent and proud!


798
00:38:05.391 --> 00:38:09.115
Okay, it's this one
right here, think fast.


799
00:38:13.356 --> 00:38:17.632
Okay, get this, this and
this is both toilet paper.


800
00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:22.184
And this is what 10,000
rolls looks like.


801
00:38:23.805 --> 00:38:25.975
Why's everyone going
nuts for toilet paper?


802
00:38:25.977 --> 00:38:27.803
I thought the virus
was respiratory.


803
00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:30.872
It's a pandemic, man, people
wanna go crazy about stuff,


804
00:38:30.874 --> 00:38:34.285
makes it feel like
they're in control.


805
00:38:34.287 --> 00:38:36.113
That doesn't make any sense.

806
00:38:36.115 --> 00:38:37.975
That's the whole point.

807
00:38:37.977 --> 00:38:40.872
It's panic, people do crazy
stuff when they panic.


808
00:38:40.874 --> 00:38:43.147
Now look, we're not even
halfway to our goal.


809
00:38:43.149 --> 00:38:45.975
Hector's only moving

810
00:38:45.977 --> 00:38:47.285
which means with all this,

811
00:38:47.287 --> 00:38:50.699
there is no way we're
gonna make it in time.


812
00:38:50.701 --> 00:38:53.184
So you know what I'm thinking?

813
00:38:54.977 --> 00:38:56.182
Yeah?

814
00:38:56.184 --> 00:38:59.561
I'm thinking we
add another dealer.


815
00:38:59.563 --> 00:39:01.630
This guy is ex
-KGB,

816
00:39:01.632 --> 00:39:04.734
so don't ask any
unnecessary questions.


817
00:39:04.736 --> 00:39:08.078
Man's paranoid, pretty sure
he's killed a few people.


818
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.699
He's going to have
his daughters with him


819
00:39:09.701 --> 00:39:13.596
because he's home schooling,
Sasha and Natasha,


820
00:39:13.598 --> 00:39:16.768
so whatever you do,
don't get 'em confused,


821
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:20.389
'cause they'll get
super bent over it.


822
00:39:22.667 --> 00:39:25.078
So which one is which?

823
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.356
That's easy, Sasha's the
one with the longer hair.


824
00:39:30.425 --> 00:39:32.389
Okay, I see it.

825
00:39:32.391 --> 00:39:35.216
Do you see any
difference between...


826
00:39:35.218 --> 00:39:36.734
What is this?

827
00:39:36.736 --> 00:39:40.561
That, my friend, is
American-made single ply.


828
00:39:40.563 --> 00:39:43.699
What is it for, Jolly
Green Giant?


829
00:39:43.701 --> 00:39:45.561
This will fit on no one's spool.

830
00:39:45.563 --> 00:39:48.699
In a time of crisis,
nobody cares about spools.


831
00:39:48.701 --> 00:39:50.701
Ah, it's rough Bernie.

832
00:39:52.563 --> 00:39:54.218
It's like sandpaper.

833
00:39:55.253 --> 00:39:56.734
It's not that bad.

834
00:39:56.736 --> 00:39:58.872
It's awful, it's like,
it's like the stuff they have


835
00:39:58.874 --> 00:40:00.216
in peurda-podies.

836
00:40:00.218 --> 00:40:01.768
Port-a-potties.

837
00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.872
That's what I
said, peurda-podies.


838
00:40:04.874 --> 00:40:08.906
I cannot sell this, this,
no one wants that torture.


839
00:40:08.908 --> 00:40:11.494
Dmitry, on the way over here,

840
00:40:12.563 --> 00:40:14.010
I saw an article about how

841
00:40:14.012 --> 00:40:15.872
when people are running
out of toilet paper,


842
00:40:15.874 --> 00:40:17.529
they're using socks.

843
00:40:18.529 --> 00:40:19.529
Socks.

844
00:40:21.046 --> 00:40:23.182
You can't flush a sock,

845
00:40:23.184 --> 00:40:26.872
you gotta carry it
through the house,


846
00:40:26.874 --> 00:40:28.458
through the kitchen.

847
00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.389
Put it in a bag,
put it in a can,


848
00:40:30.391 --> 00:40:32.425
you gotta set it outside.

849
00:40:33.598 --> 00:40:37.216
Now, the people that
are using socks, Dmitry,


850
00:40:37.218 --> 00:40:40.078
they'll pay top dollar for that.

851
00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.044
What do you think, daughters?

852
00:40:42.046 --> 00:40:44.389
You think Americans
stupid enough to buy this?


853
00:40:44.391 --> 00:40:46.354
Da.

854
00:40:46.356 --> 00:40:48.906
Hmm, you're probably right.

855
00:40:48.908 --> 00:40:50.941
I mean, look at him.

856
00:40:50.943 --> 00:40:55.908
He's wearing a mask like
a lemming.


857
00:40:56.701 --> 00:40:58.010
It's for the virus.

858
00:40:58.012 --> 00:40:59.596
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, sure it is.

859
00:41:01.977 --> 00:41:04.941
You're so smart,
you know, yeah, yeah.


860
00:41:04.943 --> 00:41:07.080
You probably buy all this.

861
00:41:08.012 --> 00:41:09.320
I'll give you eight per roll.

862
00:41:09.322 --> 00:41:10.423
What? No.

863
00:41:10.425 --> 00:41:11.425
No, no.

864
00:41:12.287 --> 00:41:13.596
20.

865
00:41:13.598 --> 00:41:16.354
Toilet paper in gulags
was softer than this!


866
00:41:16.356 --> 00:41:18.113
Eight or I walk.

867
00:41:18.115 --> 00:41:21.425
And you can sell this
travesty yourself.


868
00:41:27.149 --> 00:41:28.218
Okay, deal.

869
00:41:31.943 --> 00:41:35.906
Perfect, so, your girls,
what are they working on?


870
00:41:35.908 --> 00:41:37.046
Math, reading?

871
00:41:39.115 --> 00:41:41.803
They're working on the election.

872
00:41:41.805 --> 00:41:44.941
Mm hmm, they're
gonna do it again.


873
00:41:44.943 --> 00:41:46.872
They did it last
time, now this time,


874
00:41:46.874 --> 00:41:49.320
this time, you know, last
time I helped a little bit.


875
00:41:49.322 --> 00:41:52.113
You know, 2016, they were
like, "Daddy, help me",


876
00:41:52.115 --> 00:41:55.010
I forgot, er, what
Pentagon password?"


877
00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:56.630
I was like, "Yes, here you go,"

878
00:41:56.632 --> 00:41:58.182
and they're like,
"What is nuclear code?"


879
00:41:58.184 --> 00:41:59.872
I'm like, "You got to
write down on your hand."


880
00:41:59.874 --> 00:42:01.527
You know, they were
little things, but now,


881
00:42:01.529 --> 00:42:03.389
now they grow up so
fast, and I am so proud,


882
00:42:03.391 --> 00:42:05.699
but they are doing this
one all by themselves,


883
00:42:05.701 --> 00:42:07.596
they're like, "Daddy,
don't look at my shoulder",


884
00:42:07.598 --> 00:42:09.182
you embarrass me."

885
00:42:09.184 --> 00:42:12.527
Now back then, they still
laugh at everything I say,


886
00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:14.665
you know, and they still
want to be around me,


887
00:42:14.667 --> 00:42:15.906
they still think, you know,

888
00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:17.182
they thought I was
so cool back then.


889
00:42:17.184 --> 00:42:20.012
But they, er, they
toppled Ukraine.


890
00:42:23.977 --> 00:42:25.561
Woo hoo hoo hoo!

891
00:42:25.563 --> 00:42:26.563
Yes!

892
00:42:27.529 --> 00:42:29.665
It is my day!

893
00:42:29.667 --> 00:42:30.667
Woo, yeah!

894
00:42:31.874 --> 00:42:35.147
Okay, we have the standard
equation of a circle.


895
00:42:35.149 --> 00:42:37.596
The center points
are represented


896
00:42:37.598 --> 00:42:39.908
by the coordinate pair h, k.

897
00:42:41.563 --> 00:42:43.699
It has a vertical
axis of symmetry,


898
00:42:43.701 --> 00:42:46.494
the equation of
the circle is x-h.


899
00:42:47.701 --> 00:42:51.356
Mommy, where'd this
toilet paper come from?


900
00:42:59.391 --> 00:43:00.391
It's back.

901
00:43:02.253 --> 00:43:03.216
It's all back.

902
00:43:03.218 --> 00:43:05.184
Two options, option A.

903
00:43:12.805 --> 00:43:14.391
Okay, no, no, no.

904
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.423
That is not gonna happen here.

905
00:43:18.425 --> 00:43:21.044
American-made on enough
done rocket launcher.


906
00:43:21.046 --> 00:43:22.596
That's got to be illegal.

907
00:43:22.598 --> 00:43:24.251
It is, I'm just kidding.

908
00:43:24.253 --> 00:43:26.389
Now, let's say you meet a guy

909
00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:28.906
that wants to trade
you for a car.


910
00:43:28.908 --> 00:43:31.113
Loopholes, boys, loopholes.

911
00:43:31.115 --> 00:43:32.768
I thought you were
supposed to be in Cabo.


912
00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:35.596
Oh, those commies
at the airport.


913
00:43:35.598 --> 00:43:37.803
They were taking
everybody's temperature.


914
00:43:37.805 --> 00:43:39.078
They wouldn't let
me on the plane.


915
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.320
You have a fever?

916
00:43:40.322 --> 00:43:42.906
Well, I naturally run hot.

917
00:43:42.908 --> 00:43:45.492
99.1 degrees, I always have.

918
00:43:45.494 --> 00:43:48.251
And besides, I just moved
my flight to tomorrow.


919
00:43:48.253 --> 00:43:53.218
How are you going to go
flying if you have a fever?


920
00:43:54.425 --> 00:43:55.561
I'm just gonna put
ice on my forehead


921
00:43:55.563 --> 00:43:58.044
until I get through security.

922
00:43:58.046 --> 00:44:00.665
Well, what about
the other option


923
00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:03.665
for people not wanting
to overthrow a country?


924
00:44:03.667 --> 00:44:06.803
That's option B, but
it's not nearly as fun.


925
00:44:14.598 --> 00:44:15.906
Hand sanitizer gel.

926
00:44:15.908 --> 00:44:18.492
This morning, three
ounces of this sold


927
00:44:18.494 --> 00:44:20.975
for $12 on an auction site.

928
00:44:20.977 --> 00:44:23.285
Now, this barrel has
over 7,000 ounces,


929
00:44:23.287 --> 00:44:27.770
which means this 55 gallon
drum is worth over $28,000.


930
00:44:31.667 --> 00:44:33.216
And I've got six barrels of it.

931
00:44:33.218 --> 00:44:35.044
It's way too much, Jack,

932
00:44:35.046 --> 00:44:37.113
Oh Hector, this
is all we have left.


933
00:44:37.115 --> 00:44:38.805
We have to sell this.

934
00:44:41.322 --> 00:44:43.423
You can put it into bottles?

935
00:44:43.425 --> 00:44:44.665
What?

936
00:44:44.667 --> 00:44:46.734
You know, little
bottles, lots of them.


937
00:44:46.736 --> 00:44:48.320
Then you sell
thousands for cheap,


938
00:44:48.322 --> 00:44:50.630
make a killing on the postage.

939
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.527
This is ridiculous.

940
00:45:07.529 --> 00:45:08.734
It beats doing nothing.

941
00:45:08.736 --> 00:45:11.423
No, that's, no, that's not true.

942
00:45:11.425 --> 00:45:12.596
And I'm gonna tell a story.

943
00:45:12.598 --> 00:45:14.182
No, no.

944
00:45:14.184 --> 00:45:17.354
Once there was two grown
men who became so scared,


945
00:45:17.356 --> 00:45:20.596
that they were acting
like little boys,


946
00:45:20.598 --> 00:45:23.906
because all the people
that they were around


947
00:45:23.908 --> 00:45:26.561
were crazy and panicking,

948
00:45:26.563 --> 00:45:29.872
who refused to use common sense.

949
00:45:29.874 --> 00:45:31.216
Your story's about us, isn't it?

950
00:45:31.218 --> 00:45:34.216
So these two grown
men started scalping


951
00:45:34.218 --> 00:45:36.839
smelly lotion to fearful people

952
00:45:38.012 --> 00:45:41.113
until their hands
became so soft,


953
00:45:41.115 --> 00:45:44.906
they couldn't find not one
woman in the whole side world


954
00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:47.251
who would marry them
because their hands


955
00:45:47.253 --> 00:45:49.906
were soft like
little girls' hands,


956
00:45:49.908 --> 00:45:52.596
and women found that
to be disturbing.


957
00:45:52.598 --> 00:45:54.630
Mom, that's ridiculous.

958
00:45:54.632 --> 00:45:57.561
Have you felt these hands?

959
00:45:57.563 --> 00:45:59.596
Have you smelt them?

960
00:45:59.598 --> 00:46:02.458
You're a man, a grown man.

961
00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.182
I'm already married.

962
00:46:04.184 --> 00:46:07.182
One of the men was married too.

963
00:46:07.184 --> 00:46:09.494
But he didn't stay that way.

964
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.630
Dud, we gotta get more help.

965
00:46:13.632 --> 00:46:17.285
I will not fear,
for you are with me.


966
00:46:17.287 --> 00:46:22.080
And we pray that you will fix
my son's giant, girly hands.


967
00:46:23.736 --> 00:46:25.182
Yes, lord.

968
00:46:25.184 --> 00:46:26.184
Amen.

969
00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.734
Today for school,
we are gonna learn


970
00:46:29.736 --> 00:46:32.182
about supply and demand.

971
00:46:32.184 --> 00:46:35.285
And to do it, we're gonna start
by making an assembly line


972
00:46:35.287 --> 00:46:37.182
and filling up a few
thousand of these bottles


973
00:46:37.184 --> 00:46:39.285
with lotion from that blue
barrel right over there.


974
00:46:39.287 --> 00:46:40.941
Doesn't that sound like fun?

975
00:46:40.943 --> 00:46:41.837
- Yes!
- Yes.


976
00:46:41.839 --> 00:46:43.354
Yes!

977
00:46:43.356 --> 00:46:47.078
Now, we are not gonna tell
Mommy about it, are we?


978
00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.736
But what if we do?

979
00:46:52.115 --> 00:46:53.492
What's with the barrel?

980
00:46:53.494 --> 00:46:56.046
We are adapting to the times.

981
00:46:58.494 --> 00:47:01.010
And these are really
strange times.


982
00:47:01.012 --> 00:47:02.699
I feel ya.

983
00:47:02.701 --> 00:47:05.285
Nerman, is that a
koozie on your face?


984
00:47:05.287 --> 00:47:06.630
Yeah.

985
00:47:06.632 --> 00:47:08.667
And you think it works?

986
00:47:10.184 --> 00:47:13.010
People are staying away from me.

987
00:47:13.012 --> 00:47:14.561
What's wrong?

988
00:47:14.563 --> 00:47:18.010
Sorry Jack, they
shut me down, man.


989
00:47:18.012 --> 00:47:19.354
I'm out of business.

990
00:47:19.356 --> 00:47:20.941
How did they just shut you down?

991
00:47:20.943 --> 00:47:23.527
Blocked the prices,
they blocked my ID,


992
00:47:23.529 --> 00:47:24.699
they just shut us out.

993
00:47:24.701 --> 00:47:26.975
I have 7,000 bottles
of lotion to move.


994
00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:28.665
I understand, Jack, I really do.

995
00:47:28.667 --> 00:47:31.182
I mean, look, I want
Hectorzita to go to university,


996
00:47:31.184 --> 00:47:32.906
I want him to play
for the Cruz Azul,


997
00:47:32.908 --> 00:47:34.699
but his school isn't that good!

998
00:47:34.701 --> 00:47:36.216
Can't you make some new
accounts or something?


999
00:47:36.218 --> 00:47:38.596
No, no, no, and it
wouldn't do any good


1000
00:47:38.598 --> 00:47:40.596
even if I did, 'cause they
would just shut us down anyway.


1001
00:47:40.598 --> 00:47:44.354
These guys are fast,
they take us out.


1002
00:47:44.356 --> 00:47:47.182
Bad news, brothers,
the gig is up.


1003
00:47:47.184 --> 00:47:49.012
Thank you for playing.

1004
00:47:50.736 --> 00:47:51.665
What?

1005
00:47:51.667 --> 00:47:53.251
They shut off the auctions.

1006
00:47:53.253 --> 00:47:57.010
Locked my computers,
they came down hard.


1007
00:47:57.012 --> 00:48:00.147
Like, like hammer
and sickle hard.


1008
00:48:00.149 --> 00:48:01.423
You too?

1009
00:48:01.425 --> 00:48:04.113
They've locked the
prices for everything.


1010
00:48:04.115 --> 00:48:06.803
And you call this
a free country.


1011
00:48:06.805 --> 00:48:09.287
Welcome to Russia, my friends.

1012
00:48:10.632 --> 00:48:13.768
Stalin welcomes you!

1013
00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.423
You know, now we can drink
like proper Russians.


1014
00:48:16.425 --> 00:48:20.287
I must admit, I had
another bottle before this,


1015
00:48:21.253 --> 00:48:22.906
but sh, do not tell anyone,

1016
00:48:22.908 --> 00:48:27.423
because it is a secret.

1017
00:48:27.425 --> 00:48:28.630
What are we gonna do?

1018
00:48:28.632 --> 00:48:29.941
Whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait,


1019
00:48:29.943 --> 00:48:31.906
come here, come here,
come into my secret.


1020
00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:32.872
Six feet.

1021
00:48:32.874 --> 00:48:34.216
Let me give you some advice.

1022
00:48:34.218 --> 00:48:36.320
If you find yourself in gulag,

1023
00:48:36.322 --> 00:48:38.941
when they first shove you in,

1024
00:48:38.943 --> 00:48:41.630
right there in front of
all the other prisoners,


1025
00:48:41.632 --> 00:48:45.458
you find the biggest
one you can find


1026
00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.391
and you walk right
directly to him,


1027
00:48:49.253 --> 00:48:50.701
and you llck him.

1028
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.218
Like a lizard.

1029
00:48:56.598 --> 00:48:58.906
The big guy's
confused, you know,


1030
00:48:58.908 --> 00:49:02.080
they'll all leave
you alone after that.


1031
00:49:03.287 --> 00:49:05.354
Saved my butt more than
one times.


1032
00:49:05.356 --> 00:49:07.182
Right?

1033
00:49:07.184 --> 00:49:08.184
Two times.

1034
00:49:10.322 --> 00:49:15.147
You know, maybe, maybe
there is someone I can call.


1035
00:49:15.149 --> 00:49:18.287
I'll call him for
you, but no problem.


1036
00:49:19.494 --> 00:49:21.320
It's all good, it's okay.

1037
00:49:21.322 --> 00:49:22.216
How is it okay?

1038
00:49:22.218 --> 00:49:24.975
Dmitry's gonna call his guy.

1039
00:49:24.977 --> 00:49:26.768
So we just gotta
have a little faith.


1040
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:28.492
Have faith?

1041
00:49:28.494 --> 00:49:31.527
In the crazy Russian guy's
friend that we don't know?


1042
00:49:31.529 --> 00:49:33.320
Governor announced this morning

1043
00:49:33.322 --> 00:49:34.975
- a shelter-in-place order...
- Yeah.


1044
00:49:34.977 --> 00:49:36.492
For the entire state,

1045
00:49:36.494 --> 00:49:38.975
including mandatory
curfew within city limits


1046
00:49:38.977 --> 00:49:41.665
starting at eight PM for
everyone not considered


1047
00:49:41.667 --> 00:49:44.458
essential to critical
infrastructure.


1048
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.665
Police will be out
enforcing curfew,


1049
00:49:46.667 --> 00:49:48.044
so if you go out on the road...

1050
00:49:48.046 --> 00:49:49.699
That's gonna make it easier.

1051
00:49:49.701 --> 00:49:51.699
Moe after the break.

1052
00:50:01.874 --> 00:50:03.941
Hello, beautiful.

1053
00:50:03.943 --> 00:50:04.837
You're kidding me.

1054
00:50:04.839 --> 00:50:07.320
There's no temperature checks,

1055
00:50:07.322 --> 00:50:10.665
there's no awkward TSA screens.

1056
00:50:10.667 --> 00:50:12.837
There's no metal detectors.

1057
00:50:12.839 --> 00:50:16.699
Just pure, American
capitalism at its finest.


1058
00:50:16.701 --> 00:50:18.184
God bless America.

1059
00:50:29.149 --> 00:50:31.630
Can this even get you to Cabo?

1060
00:50:31.632 --> 00:50:33.975
It'll take you to Tahiti
if you pay 'em enough.


1061
00:50:33.977 --> 00:50:35.734
There still gonna
screen you at the airport.


1062
00:50:35.736 --> 00:50:39.975
But who says I'm
landing at an airport?


1063
00:50:46.012 --> 00:50:49.977
Hello, hey?

1064
00:50:53.805 --> 00:50:54.805
Hello?

1065
00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:00.078
Did he use the codeword?

1066
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.837
I don't know.

1067
00:51:01.839 --> 00:51:02.665
What?

1068
00:51:02.667 --> 00:51:03.596
I don't remember.

1069
00:51:03.598 --> 00:51:04.527
How don't you remember?

1070
00:51:04.529 --> 00:51:05.699
I was half asleep.

1071
00:51:05.701 --> 00:51:07.803
That was one of the rules.

1072
00:51:07.805 --> 00:51:11.734
They have to use the codeword
or we don't do a deal.


1073
00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:13.389
Look, we need this to happen.

1074
00:51:13.391 --> 00:51:15.872
And we're nowhere
near a public place.


1075
00:51:15.874 --> 00:51:17.216
Another rule.

1076
00:51:17.218 --> 00:51:18.768
We're selling hand sanitizer,

1077
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:20.044
what's the worst
that can happen?


1078
00:51:20.046 --> 00:51:22.184
They'll clean us to death?

1079
00:51:26.046 --> 00:51:27.046
Punch,

1080
00:51:27.908 --> 00:51:29.389
what are you doing?

1081
00:51:29.391 --> 00:51:31.699
We're not even supposed
to be out here, man!


1082
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:32.701
Curfew!

1083
00:51:36.563 --> 00:51:38.078
Well, I hate to tell you this,

1084
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.216
but squishing down like that
doesn't make you inconspicuous.


1085
00:51:42.218 --> 00:51:43.736
Dude, it's our guy.

1086
00:51:45.667 --> 00:51:46.701
Just be cool.

1087
00:51:50.218 --> 00:51:52.078
I think I'm gonna do it.

1088
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.630
I'm gonna do the spray.

1089
00:51:53.632 --> 00:51:55.734
Okay sure, fine, whatever
makes you feel good.


1090
00:51:55.736 --> 00:51:56.561
Okay.

1091
00:51:56.563 --> 00:51:58.010
Okay.

1092
00:51:58.012 --> 00:51:59.285
I'll do it.

1093
00:51:59.287 --> 00:52:00.941
Oh dude, they brought,
they brought backup.


1094
00:52:00.943 --> 00:52:03.113
That's okay, we
brought backup too.


1095
00:52:03.115 --> 00:52:03.941
We did?

1096
00:52:03.943 --> 00:52:04.768
What did we bring?

1097
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:05.839
Again, you!

1098
00:52:07.012 --> 00:52:09.354
I make the deal, you
stand there being big.


1099
00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:12.630
Oh dude, you're not
nearly big enough.


1100
00:52:12.632 --> 00:52:13.941
They bring a giant?

1101
00:52:13.943 --> 00:52:17.596
You only had one job to do, man!

1102
00:52:17.598 --> 00:52:20.285
They brought a giant!

1103
00:52:20.287 --> 00:52:21.941
It's okay, what's the
worst that can happen?


1104
00:52:21.943 --> 00:52:23.665
The giant could eat us.

1105
00:52:23.667 --> 00:52:25.458
Now is not the time to panic.

1106
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:30.322
Everything about this makes
it the perfect time to panic.


1107
00:52:38.287 --> 00:52:39.667
How's it going?

1108
00:52:41.977 --> 00:52:43.113
You Primo?

1109
00:52:44.356 --> 00:52:47.391
All right, I'm Jack,
this here is Punch.


1110
00:52:58.598 --> 00:53:00.872
Do you want some spray?

1111
00:53:00.874 --> 00:53:02.044
For what?

1112
00:53:02.046 --> 00:53:03.906
For your hands.

1113
00:53:03.908 --> 00:53:05.322
Sanitizing spray.

1114
00:53:06.253 --> 00:53:07.322
It's oatmeal.

1115
00:53:08.184 --> 00:53:09.494
Oatmeal cookies.

1116
00:53:10.839 --> 00:53:12.147
It's really, really good.

1117
00:53:12.149 --> 00:53:14.010
Okay, sure.

1118
00:53:24.494 --> 00:53:26.632
Oh wow, that's delightful.

1119
00:53:28.012 --> 00:53:29.010
Now what did you bring?

1120
00:53:29.012 --> 00:53:30.839
Please, have a seat.

1121
00:53:35.874 --> 00:53:39.012
Why did you bring
such cheap chairs?


1122
00:53:40.563 --> 00:53:45.149
I'm sorry, I, I wasn't expecting
a man of your, um, heft.


1123
00:54:09.046 --> 00:54:10.046
Okay.

1124
00:54:11.253 --> 00:54:14.216
I've got 7,000 of these bad boys

1125
00:54:14.218 --> 00:54:15.906
ready to go in the
truck right now.


1126
00:54:15.908 --> 00:54:19.768
Top grade hand sanitizer
guaranteed to kill COVID,


1127
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.734
and 99.9% of all germs.

1128
00:54:22.736 --> 00:54:25.906
They were selling online this
morning for 12 bucks a pop.


1129
00:54:25.908 --> 00:54:27.527
I'll give 'em to you for four.

1130
00:54:27.529 --> 00:54:28.423
Four?

1131
00:54:28.425 --> 00:54:29.425
Each.

1132
00:54:33.977 --> 00:54:36.630
Skinny, what are you doing?

1133
00:54:36.632 --> 00:54:38.044
He's smelling the trees.

1134
00:54:38.046 --> 00:54:40.975
It's a weird smell, man, I,

1135
00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:44.251
I can't figure out
what's happening here.


1136
00:54:44.253 --> 00:54:47.701
You're supposed to
be watching the car.


1137
00:54:49.425 --> 00:54:50.736
I'll get him.

1138
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:55.768
What am I supposed to do
with a bunch of girly lotions?


1139
00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:56.941
Sell it.

1140
00:54:56.943 --> 00:54:57.943
Now this is what-

1141
00:55:03.977 --> 00:55:06.665
This is funny, that's good.

1142
00:55:06.667 --> 00:55:08.699
That's good, okay, now,

1143
00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:11.527
now, now, seriously, boys.

1144
00:55:11.529 --> 00:55:13.837
Where are the guns?

1145
00:55:13.839 --> 00:55:16.010
We've made a horrible error.

1146
00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:16.837
Guns?

1147
00:55:16.839 --> 00:55:18.354
Yeah.

1148
00:55:18.356 --> 00:55:20.492
My friend gave me this number,

1149
00:55:20.494 --> 00:55:22.354
I called this number,

1150
00:55:22.356 --> 00:55:25.527
someone brings guns, I buy guns.

1151
00:55:25.529 --> 00:55:26.872
That's how this works.

1152
00:55:26.874 --> 00:55:29.492
Okay, see, we thought
that you were a friend


1153
00:55:29.494 --> 00:55:31.010
of our friend Dmitry.

1154
00:55:31.012 --> 00:55:32.320
Who's Dmitry?

1155
00:55:32.322 --> 00:55:35.941
Yeah, um, I can see why you're,

1156
00:55:35.943 --> 00:55:39.113
okay, so you called,
but we thought you were


1157
00:55:39.115 --> 00:55:41.285
a friend of our
friend, but you're not,


1158
00:55:41.287 --> 00:55:43.839
so what we have here is just a,

1159
00:55:44.701 --> 00:55:48.147
it's a classic misunderstanding.

1160
00:55:48.149 --> 00:55:50.285
Right, right, right, right,
so you don't have guns.


1161
00:55:50.287 --> 00:55:51.561
No.

1162
00:55:51.563 --> 00:55:53.665
Right, my uncle Bernie
sold the guns, right?


1163
00:55:53.667 --> 00:55:57.010
But then he retired,
and then we took over,


1164
00:55:57.012 --> 00:56:00.216
but we've been selling,
you know, just soaps.


1165
00:56:00.218 --> 00:56:02.699
Okay, so you do have guns?

1166
00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:05.078
Right, we're just not selling.

1167
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:08.012
So you're not
selling guns to me?


1168
00:56:11.356 --> 00:56:13.354
I wouldn't put it like that.

1169
00:56:13.356 --> 00:56:14.872
So how would you put it?

1170
00:56:14.874 --> 00:56:19.184
Like that, just not with
the derogatory bent at all.


1171
00:56:22.046 --> 00:56:24.216
You see, I have a problem.

1172
00:56:24.218 --> 00:56:26.044
- I have a gun.
- Whoa!


1173
00:56:26.046 --> 00:56:30.423
And sometimes, it just
doesn't do me right, you know?


1174
00:56:30.425 --> 00:56:33.458
Sometimes, I pull the
trigger, nothing happens.


1175
00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.975
You know, like
it's broke, right?


1176
00:56:34.977 --> 00:56:39.216
And then the other times, I
don't pull the trigger at all,


1177
00:56:39.218 --> 00:56:40.458
and it just goes off.

1178
00:56:42.943 --> 00:56:44.285
That's what I'm talking about.

1179
00:56:44.287 --> 00:56:46.044
It's just unpredictable,

1180
00:56:46.046 --> 00:56:47.251
and that's what I mean, I mean,

1181
00:56:47.253 --> 00:56:49.563
how can I manage my business

1182
00:56:51.046 --> 00:56:55.667
with a gun that just goes off
at random shooting people?


1183
00:56:56.563 --> 00:56:57.458
You know what I'm saying?

1184
00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.941
Like, it's just unprofessional.

1185
00:56:59.943 --> 00:57:00.941
You feel me?

1186
00:57:00.943 --> 00:57:01.906
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.


1187
00:57:01.908 --> 00:57:03.423
- Do you?
- Yeah.


1188
00:57:03.425 --> 00:57:05.458
Yeah, that's, that's no
good way to run a business.


1189
00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:06.665
That's good, I like that,

1190
00:57:06.667 --> 00:57:09.251
I'm glad, I'm glad you
guys feel me, all right?


1191
00:57:09.253 --> 00:57:10.253
Now.

1192
00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:16.460
Oops.

1193
00:57:18.322 --> 00:57:19.630
So here's what we're gonna do.

1194
00:57:19.632 --> 00:57:22.596
Tomorrow, I'm
gonna be back here.


1195
00:57:22.598 --> 00:57:25.941
You two boys better bring
me my guns, you feel me?


1196
00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:26.941
- Mm hmm.
- Mm.


1197
00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:27.943
You good?

1198
00:57:29.184 --> 00:57:30.184
Cool.

1199
00:57:31.598 --> 00:57:32.941
'Cause if you don't,

1200
00:57:32.943 --> 00:57:37.147
I'm gonna have my boys
run you guys down.


1201
00:57:37.149 --> 00:57:39.458
And let's just say you
really don't want that.


1202
00:57:41.632 --> 00:57:44.182
You know, he's right though,

1203
00:57:44.184 --> 00:57:47.839
the trees do got a smell
to 'em, it's weird.


1204
00:57:51.149 --> 00:57:53.563
It's like they have a plan.

1205
00:57:55.287 --> 00:57:56.287
Let's go!

1206
00:58:09.529 --> 00:58:11.492
Dude, he shot you!

1207
00:58:11.494 --> 00:58:12.975
Yeah, I know that man!

1208
00:58:12.977 --> 00:58:15.423
Like, you got shot shot!

1209
00:58:15.425 --> 00:58:17.596
Yeah, I know
that, I can feel it!


1210
00:58:17.598 --> 00:58:19.665
I can't see, how bad is it?

1211
00:58:19.667 --> 00:58:22.012
Oh man, they're pretty bad.

1212
00:58:23.356 --> 00:58:25.423
They're shattered.

1213
00:58:25.425 --> 00:58:27.492
Not the glasses, man!

1214
00:58:27.494 --> 00:58:31.287
Oh, um, yeah, I don't
do so good with blood.


1215
00:58:32.839 --> 00:58:35.251
Would you just get over
here and check it out, please?


1216
00:58:35.253 --> 00:58:36.492
How bad is it?

1217
00:58:36.494 --> 00:58:39.803
Okay, I feel really
weird about this.


1218
00:58:39.805 --> 00:58:40.837
Just do it.

1219
00:58:40.839 --> 00:58:42.630
Okay, okay.

1220
00:58:42.632 --> 00:58:44.287
Um, there's two, oh.

1221
00:58:49.322 --> 00:58:50.322
Two what?

1222
00:58:52.908 --> 00:58:54.561
Are you kidding me?

1223
00:58:54.563 --> 00:58:56.561
You are the worst backup
of all the backup.


1224
00:58:56.563 --> 00:58:58.561
Get up, man, get up!

1225
00:58:58.563 --> 00:59:00.768
Come on, have a
little bit of dignity.


1226
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:02.216
Okay, sorry.

1227
00:59:02.218 --> 00:59:03.044
I'm okay.

1228
00:59:03.046 --> 00:59:05.078
How bad is it?

1229
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.320
Man, look yourself.

1230
00:59:06.322 --> 00:59:09.389
I can't see, man,
I'm flying blind here.


1231
00:59:09.391 --> 00:59:11.701
Okay, your gluteus is bad.

1232
00:59:13.287 --> 00:59:16.320
But I'm just, I'm just
gonna stay right here.


1233
00:59:16.322 --> 00:59:18.460
Is there a lot of blood?

1234
00:59:23.805 --> 00:59:24.734
Oh yeah.

1235
00:59:24.736 --> 00:59:26.285
Keep it together, man.

1236
00:59:26.287 --> 00:59:27.699
It went in your,

1237
00:59:27.701 --> 00:59:29.596
and then it came out the other,

1238
00:59:29.598 --> 00:59:31.805
it came out the other side.

1239
00:59:33.322 --> 00:59:35.423
But I think you're
gonna be okay.


1240
00:59:35.425 --> 00:59:38.389
It just, it just
hit the chunky part.


1241
00:59:38.391 --> 00:59:40.874
It didn't hit the bone at all.

1242
00:59:42.253 --> 00:59:44.458
I can't believe
you let me get shot.


1243
00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.320
What?

1244
00:59:45.322 --> 00:59:46.458
How's this my fault?

1245
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:47.975
You were the backup,

1246
00:59:47.977 --> 00:59:50.285
you're supposed to be
big and intimidating,


1247
00:59:50.287 --> 00:59:51.492
and do something heroic.

1248
00:59:51.494 --> 00:59:53.458
I wanted to start a marble race.

1249
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:57.596
No, you wanted to start
a toilet paper empire.


1250
00:59:57.598 --> 01:00:00.078
Okay, we gotta
go to the hospital.


1251
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.734
No, we can't do that.

1252
01:00:01.736 --> 01:00:03.113
Punch, I've been shot.

1253
01:00:03.115 --> 01:00:04.285
We gotta go to the hospital.

1254
01:00:04.287 --> 01:00:06.803
One, I don't really
like your tone.


1255
01:00:06.805 --> 01:00:08.975
Two, we can't go
to the hospital,


1256
01:00:08.977 --> 01:00:11.078
it's full of the death virus.

1257
01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.734
Three, you've got
a gunshot wound!


1258
01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:15.423
They'll ask questions!

1259
01:00:15.425 --> 01:00:17.218
And it's after curfew.

1260
01:00:18.908 --> 01:00:20.423
Curfew?

1261
01:00:20.425 --> 01:00:21.906
That's what you're thinking
about right now is the curfew?


1262
01:00:21.908 --> 01:00:23.630
You'll probably be fine,

1263
01:00:23.632 --> 01:00:28.216
it's just a flesh wound, we
can put some Neosporin on it,


1264
01:00:28.218 --> 01:00:31.529
and I can teach you
some therapy squats.


1265
01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:37.701
Can you just please, just
help me get to the car?


1266
01:00:48.425 --> 01:00:50.147
What's wrong with your car?

1267
01:00:50.149 --> 01:00:51.906
It's fine.

1268
01:00:51.908 --> 01:00:53.768
It's not though.

1269
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:57.147
The last thing this
car is is fine.


1270
01:00:57.149 --> 01:00:59.837
You gotta just give it a minute.

1271
01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:04.630
Why can't you just get
a regular human being car?


1272
01:01:22.149 --> 01:01:23.320
What the what?

1273
01:01:23.322 --> 01:01:25.285
Dude, why'd you
bring your kid along?


1274
01:01:25.287 --> 01:01:26.803
That's not my kid.

1275
01:01:26.805 --> 01:01:28.216
What do you mean,
that's not your kid?


1276
01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:30.837
I have five kids, Punch,
that isn't one of 'em.


1277
01:01:30.839 --> 01:01:32.147
Are you sure?

1278
01:01:32.149 --> 01:01:35.322
I mean, your eyes are
all messed up and all.


1279
01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.147
Yep, it's not my kid.

1280
01:01:47.149 --> 01:01:48.182
Well, whose kid is it?

1281
01:01:48.184 --> 01:01:49.492
I don't know.

1282
01:01:49.494 --> 01:01:51.044
Do you think it
could be his kid?


1283
01:01:51.046 --> 01:01:52.630
No, it can't be his kid.

1284
01:01:52.632 --> 01:01:55.460
Where do you
think she came from?


1285
01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.354
Why are you looking up?

1286
01:02:00.356 --> 01:02:01.494
I don't know.

1287
01:02:06.218 --> 01:02:09.218
Hi, kiddo, I'm
Jack, this is Punch.


1288
01:02:11.218 --> 01:02:13.736
Were you in those people's car?

1289
01:02:16.218 --> 01:02:18.598
Was that huge guy your dad?

1290
01:02:22.218 --> 01:02:25.837
Were any of those guys your dad?

1291
01:02:25.839 --> 01:02:27.354
Uncles?

1292
01:02:27.356 --> 01:02:29.216
Family friends?

1293
01:02:29.218 --> 01:02:30.699
Neighbors?

1294
01:02:30.701 --> 01:02:31.701
Pen pals?

1295
01:02:44.425 --> 01:02:46.423
Dude, I don't think
she's their kid.


1296
01:02:46.425 --> 01:02:48.734
It's absolutely not their kid.

1297
01:02:48.736 --> 01:02:50.561
I think you have a
kidnapped kid in your car.


1298
01:02:50.563 --> 01:02:53.044
Your observational skills
are killing it tonight, man.


1299
01:02:53.046 --> 01:02:55.527
Primo's gonna notice
that she's not in his car.


1300
01:02:55.529 --> 01:02:58.147
And he's gonna think
that we took her.


1301
01:02:58.149 --> 01:02:59.837
He's gonna come back
here and kill us.


1302
01:02:59.839 --> 01:03:01.906
It has to have a home, right?

1303
01:03:01.908 --> 01:03:04.251
So let's just take
it home, okay?


1304
01:03:04.253 --> 01:03:05.389
Problem solved.

1305
01:03:05.391 --> 01:03:06.872
In what car?

1306
01:03:06.874 --> 01:03:10.010
Your car won't start because
you got a defective car!


1307
01:03:14.736 --> 01:03:15.805
What is it?

1308
01:03:17.012 --> 01:03:18.839
It's an amber alert.

1309
01:03:24.632 --> 01:03:27.425
Hi, um, is your
name Maddy Holmes?


1310
01:03:31.253 --> 01:03:34.458
Is your daddy Barker Holmes?

1311
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.494
As in the mayor,
Mayor Barker Holmes?


1312
01:03:48.598 --> 01:03:49.768
There's a kidnapped
kid in our car.


1313
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.078
We are dead.

1314
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.941
The mayor's kidnapped
daughter is in our car.


1315
01:03:52.943 --> 01:03:54.320
God, I'm not ready for jail.

1316
01:03:54.322 --> 01:03:56.251
I mean, they don't have
six feet requirements,


1317
01:03:56.253 --> 01:03:58.527
and once one gets the
'rona, they all get it.


1318
01:03:58.529 --> 01:04:00.734
There's so much DNA in our car.

1319
01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.182
She's definitely seen our faces,

1320
01:04:02.184 --> 01:04:03.389
I mean, my hair's a mess

1321
01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:04.837
because all the barber
shops are closed,


1322
01:04:04.839 --> 01:04:06.010
but I'm definitely identifiable.

1323
01:04:06.012 --> 01:04:08.389
Yes, your hair's very unruly,

1324
01:04:08.391 --> 01:04:09.872
that's what we should be
focusing on right now.


1325
01:04:09.874 --> 01:04:11.699
Hey, you have a beard.

1326
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.354
Before quarantine,
you looked 12.


1327
01:04:13.356 --> 01:04:15.492
You're gonna have
to go get help.


1328
01:04:15.494 --> 01:04:16.699
What?

1329
01:04:16.701 --> 01:04:17.872
Yeah, you're gonna
have to go find somebody


1330
01:04:17.874 --> 01:04:19.354
to come and, you
know, jump our car.


1331
01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:20.872
Where?

1332
01:04:20.874 --> 01:04:22.975
I don't know man, out there
in the big ball of space!


1333
01:04:22.977 --> 01:04:24.182
Why me?

1334
01:04:24.184 --> 01:04:27.216
Because I got shot
in the a, behind of me.


1335
01:04:27.218 --> 01:04:30.768
And you failed to protect me,
and now I can't see, okay?


1336
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:33.044
So you gotta go before
Primo comes back.


1337
01:04:33.046 --> 01:04:35.251
There's nobody out
there because of the curfew!


1338
01:04:35.253 --> 01:04:37.044
Well, you'd better
hope somebody's out there


1339
01:04:37.046 --> 01:04:40.492
because the mayor's
kidnapped kid is in my car!


1340
01:04:40.494 --> 01:04:42.492
Just for a moment,
I want you to imagine


1341
01:04:42.494 --> 01:04:46.078
driving down a road and
a big, muscular man,


1342
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.354
kind of a magnificent
specimen like myself,


1343
01:04:48.356 --> 01:04:50.251
is flagging you down for help.

1344
01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.630
Would you stop?

1345
01:04:51.632 --> 01:04:53.561
If I was in a better mood.

1346
01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:59.044
Hey, kiddo, so here's the thing.

1347
01:04:59.046 --> 01:05:01.665
Punch is gonna go
and get us some help,


1348
01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:04.113
and then we are gonna
take you home, okay?


1349
01:05:04.115 --> 01:05:06.630
You aren't supposed
to be out this late.


1350
01:05:06.632 --> 01:05:08.285
Yeah, I know.

1351
01:05:08.287 --> 01:05:10.320
The city has a bedtime.

1352
01:05:10.322 --> 01:05:12.078
The curfew?

1353
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.044
Yeah.

1354
01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:16.113
Neither of you look essential.

1355
01:05:16.115 --> 01:05:18.391
Okay, that is an opinion.

1356
01:05:19.425 --> 01:05:21.596
When we drop you off at home,

1357
01:05:21.598 --> 01:05:23.734
there's gonna be
a lot of police,


1358
01:05:23.736 --> 01:05:26.423
and they're gonna have
a lot of questions.


1359
01:05:26.425 --> 01:05:29.044
So you can talk all you
want about those guys, okay,


1360
01:05:29.046 --> 01:05:30.803
but just don't talk about us.

1361
01:05:30.805 --> 01:05:33.734
You mean Jack and Punch?

1362
01:05:33.736 --> 01:05:35.147
You know our names?

1363
01:05:35.149 --> 01:05:36.908
You told me before.

1364
01:05:37.736 --> 01:05:38.699
I did.

1365
01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.251
You got shot in a bad place

1366
01:05:40.253 --> 01:05:42.906
'cause you're selling
guns and lotion.


1367
01:05:42.908 --> 01:05:45.632
Oh look at you knowing so much.

1368
01:05:46.908 --> 01:05:48.078
Okay, but listen,
we're the good guys,


1369
01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.596
we're gonna take
you home, right?


1370
01:05:49.598 --> 01:05:52.596
So you can just
leave the out, right?


1371
01:05:52.598 --> 01:05:55.251
Mommy says we
shouldn't keep secrets.


1372
01:05:55.253 --> 01:05:59.253
Oh, your mommy sounds
like a wonderful woman.


1373
01:06:07.149 --> 01:06:09.115
Er, excuse me.

1374
01:06:13.218 --> 01:06:14.285
Hello?

1375
01:06:14.287 --> 01:06:15.320
Hi.

1376
01:06:16.391 --> 01:06:17.699
Oh, no, no, no.

1377
01:06:17.701 --> 01:06:20.320
I'm having car trouble.

1378
01:06:20.322 --> 01:06:22.010
Wondered if you could help me.

1379
01:06:22.012 --> 01:06:23.839
Ho, ho, oh, the blood.

1380
01:06:25.977 --> 01:06:30.389
No, no, no, it's not
mine, it's someone else's.


1381
01:06:30.391 --> 01:06:33.768
Um, I'm having car
trouble, I was wondering


1382
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:35.872
if you could give me a jump.

1383
01:06:35.874 --> 01:06:36.874
No, a jump.

1384
01:06:38.184 --> 01:06:39.699
Oh my god!

1385
01:06:39.701 --> 01:06:40.805
Hey sir, sir.

1386
01:06:41.701 --> 01:06:43.975
Think about the virus, man!

1387
01:06:43.977 --> 01:06:48.598
No, that's cinco feet, no,
that's seis, seis, seis feet!


1388
01:06:58.529 --> 01:06:59.529
Oh.

1389
01:07:04.012 --> 01:07:06.494
Do you like bunnies?

1390
01:07:07.701 --> 01:07:09.354
Yeah, sure.

1391
01:07:09.356 --> 01:07:10.458
I like bunnies too.

1392
01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.941
Yeah, bunnies are the bomb.

1393
01:07:12.943 --> 01:07:16.425
Nobody uses the bomb
anymore, it's lame.


1394
01:07:21.046 --> 01:07:23.251
Why are you looking like that?

1395
01:07:23.253 --> 01:07:25.699
I broke my glasses
and I can't see.


1396
01:07:25.701 --> 01:07:26.701
Oh.

1397
01:07:27.736 --> 01:07:31.527
Bunnies can see really
well, it's the carrots.


1398
01:07:31.529 --> 01:07:34.527
Hey, what do you see up there?

1399
01:07:34.529 --> 01:07:35.941
A car.

1400
01:07:35.943 --> 01:07:38.354
I think it's the bad people.

1401
01:07:38.356 --> 01:07:39.906
Okay.

1402
01:07:39.908 --> 01:07:41.734
I asked them if they liked
bunnies, and they said no,


1403
01:07:41.736 --> 01:07:44.044
that's how I know
they're the bad people.


1404
01:07:44.046 --> 01:07:46.182
Okay, we're gonna have
to get out of the car.


1405
01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:28.943
This'll be fine.

1406
01:08:30.632 --> 01:08:31.632
Okay.

1407
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:44.389
Get him, get him, get him!

1408
01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.391
Over there, over there!

1409
01:08:59.322 --> 01:09:01.839
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1410
01:09:29.425 --> 01:09:30.699
It's dark in here.

1411
01:09:30.701 --> 01:09:31.701
Sh.

1412
01:09:35.322 --> 01:09:37.044
Bunnies like the dark,

1413
01:09:37.046 --> 01:09:40.701
that's why they live
underground in burrows.


1414
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:47.906
You know what bunnies don't do?

1415
01:09:47.908 --> 01:09:48.908
Talk.

1416
01:09:50.046 --> 01:09:51.872
In fact, they make
practically no noise at all,


1417
01:09:51.874 --> 01:09:54.596
and I will give you two
whole dollars right now


1418
01:09:54.598 --> 01:09:57.216
if you will be quiet
and act like a bunny.


1419
01:09:57.218 --> 01:09:58.977
You're super cheap.

1420
01:10:28.012 --> 01:10:29.182
Who was it?

1421
01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:31.182
I don't know, I
couldn't really see him,


1422
01:10:31.184 --> 01:10:33.941
and the girl had
her eyes closed.


1423
01:10:33.943 --> 01:10:36.837
I don't know, maybe
they just left you.


1424
01:10:36.839 --> 01:10:39.182
No man, it was a miracle, okay?

1425
01:10:39.184 --> 01:10:41.320
The guy looked right
in the car at us,


1426
01:10:41.322 --> 01:10:43.078
and he didn't see us.

1427
01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:46.044
Or maybe he did
and just left you.


1428
01:10:46.046 --> 01:10:48.354
Hey, the radio's working.

1429
01:10:48.356 --> 01:10:51.665
Look, you can argue and
deny it all you want, okay,


1430
01:10:51.667 --> 01:10:53.734
but it was a miracle.

1431
01:10:53.736 --> 01:10:55.149
My eyes are open.

1432
01:10:56.874 --> 01:11:00.736
You're eyes don't work
literally open or not.


1433
01:11:01.977 --> 01:11:04.563
Punch, I've had a revelation.

1434
01:11:07.287 --> 01:11:09.734
Can you have your
revelation in the car?


1435
01:11:09.736 --> 01:11:11.977
It's this pandemic, okay?

1436
01:11:13.425 --> 01:11:15.941
We're doing the same thing
as everybody else is doing,


1437
01:11:15.943 --> 01:11:17.734
but maybe we're going
about it all wrong,


1438
01:11:17.736 --> 01:11:20.458
and the miracle, it's a sign.

1439
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.768
That was the sign?

1440
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:23.596
Hey, the radio's
talking about me,


1441
01:11:23.598 --> 01:11:25.906
they say I'm missing,
but I'm not missing,


1442
01:11:25.908 --> 01:11:28.391
I'm right here, it's so silly!

1443
01:11:29.805 --> 01:11:31.734
The sign isn't you getting shot,

1444
01:11:31.736 --> 01:11:34.423
or a kidnapped girl
getting in the car,


1445
01:11:34.425 --> 01:11:37.906
that could get us in
jail for 20 years?


1446
01:11:37.908 --> 01:11:40.941
I'm just saying,
I've had an epiphany.


1447
01:11:40.943 --> 01:11:44.596
And I wanna hear all
about it in the car.


1448
01:11:54.805 --> 01:11:56.803
How close you wanna get?

1449
01:11:56.805 --> 01:11:59.044
What do you mean?

1450
01:11:59.046 --> 01:12:00.975
I mean we can't
just drive up to her house,


1451
01:12:00.977 --> 01:12:03.975
cops will be all over the place.

1452
01:12:03.977 --> 01:12:04.941
You think so?

1453
01:12:04.943 --> 01:12:06.285
Yeah, I think so.

1454
01:12:06.287 --> 01:12:10.080
Okay, just park
down the street then.


1455
01:12:13.839 --> 01:12:17.632
Well, how's
the girl gonna get home?


1456
01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:19.975
She's gonna walk.

1457
01:12:19.977 --> 01:12:21.285
Walk?

1458
01:12:21.287 --> 01:12:25.149
Yes walk, how
else would she get home?


1459
01:12:27.046 --> 01:12:29.147
I mean, it's dark out, man.

1460
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:30.630
There's crazy people out.

1461
01:12:30.632 --> 01:12:32.874
What if she gets kidnapped?

1462
01:12:34.701 --> 01:12:39.494
I want you to think
about that for just a minute.


1463
01:12:40.839 --> 01:12:43.630
I'm just gonna
say for the record,


1464
01:12:43.632 --> 01:12:46.598
I don't really agree
with this plan.


1465
01:12:48.391 --> 01:12:50.460
I'm just gonna park here.

1466
01:12:52.667 --> 01:12:55.115
This is as close as we can get.

1467
01:12:56.287 --> 01:12:57.734
Hi.

1468
01:12:57.736 --> 01:13:01.285
You think you can
walk back from here?


1469
01:13:01.287 --> 01:13:04.216
Okay, great, well, it's
been great meeting you.


1470
01:13:04.218 --> 01:13:07.113
And please don't tell
the cops about us, okay?


1471
01:13:07.115 --> 01:13:09.182
Jack and Punch.

1472
01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:11.941
Oh, yeah, we're
not going to jail.


1473
01:13:11.943 --> 01:13:14.080
Okay, out you go, bye bye.

1474
01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:22.701
Thank goodness that
that's over with.


1475
01:13:25.356 --> 01:13:27.010
You know, all I'm saying is,

1476
01:13:27.012 --> 01:13:30.354
is that people panic
when they lose control,


1477
01:13:30.356 --> 01:13:31.941
but the mistake is to ever think

1478
01:13:31.943 --> 01:13:34.561
that you had control to
begin with, you know?


1479
01:13:34.563 --> 01:13:37.837
Like, none of this has
been in our control.


1480
01:13:39.736 --> 01:13:42.389
She's back in the car,
why is she back in the car?


1481
01:13:42.391 --> 01:13:43.734
This isn't my neighborhood.

1482
01:13:43.736 --> 01:13:45.837
But you said this
was your neighborhood.


1483
01:13:45.839 --> 01:13:46.734
It's not.

1484
01:13:46.736 --> 01:13:47.872
Then why did you say it was?

1485
01:13:47.874 --> 01:13:49.458
Dude, your voice.

1486
01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:50.389
Why did you say it was?

1487
01:13:50.391 --> 01:13:53.251
It's near a red gas station.

1488
01:13:53.253 --> 01:13:54.908
A red gas station.

1489
01:13:58.529 --> 01:14:01.115
What are you looking at me for?

1490
01:14:04.632 --> 01:14:05.632
Take 20.

1491
01:14:15.115 --> 01:14:16.423
This is the ride pool, right?

1492
01:14:16.425 --> 01:14:17.285
What?

1493
01:14:17.287 --> 01:14:18.596
No!

1494
01:14:18.598 --> 01:14:20.458
Get out of the car.

1495
01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:23.010
You're not even
supposed to be out!


1496
01:14:23.012 --> 01:14:25.320
There's a death virus, man!

1497
01:14:25.322 --> 01:14:28.460
Pay attention to the
world around you!


1498
01:14:31.287 --> 01:14:33.770
He didn't even have a mask on.

1499
01:14:37.012 --> 01:14:39.492
I thought you said
that you recognized


1500
01:14:39.494 --> 01:14:40.975
the gas station back there.

1501
01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:43.527
It was red, I live
near a red gas station


1502
01:14:43.529 --> 01:14:45.665
and a coffee shop
and a grocery store


1503
01:14:45.667 --> 01:14:49.425
and it takes two to 200
minutes to get there.


1504
01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:55.943
So what do you wanna do now?

1505
01:15:00.322 --> 01:15:01.322
Okay.

1506
01:15:02.529 --> 01:15:06.699
Isn't there, like, a box
that you can put kids in


1507
01:15:06.701 --> 01:15:09.665
at like, the fire
station or something?


1508
01:15:09.667 --> 01:15:10.630
A box?

1509
01:15:10.632 --> 01:15:11.630
Yeah.

1510
01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:13.044
To put kids in?

1511
01:15:13.046 --> 01:15:15.078
Yeah you know, like,
okay, you find a kid,


1512
01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.527
and then you just drop
'em off at this box.


1513
01:15:18.529 --> 01:15:20.492
And like, there's
no questions asked.


1514
01:15:20.494 --> 01:15:24.010
How often are you
finding stray kids?


1515
01:15:24.012 --> 01:15:26.354
I just, I think this is a thing.

1516
01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:28.872
We ain't putting that
kid in no box, man!


1517
01:15:28.874 --> 01:15:31.012
We're going to jail, dude.

1518
01:15:32.908 --> 01:15:37.184
And I'm not even gonna be
able to do my marble race.


1519
01:15:38.391 --> 01:15:40.872
This is not a ride share!

1520
01:15:40.874 --> 01:15:42.320
Are you sure?

1521
01:15:43.563 --> 01:15:45.734
Looks like we're going
somewhere together.


1522
01:15:47.012 --> 01:15:50.044
Sounds like a
ride pool to me, Skinny.


1523
01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.354
It sure does, Tebo.

1524
01:15:52.356 --> 01:15:53.356
It sure does.

1525
01:15:55.046 --> 01:15:59.218
He was the one who said
he doesn't like bunnies.


1526
01:16:01.736 --> 01:16:04.285
They've got shifty eyes.

1527
01:16:04.287 --> 01:16:06.285
Red eyes, you ever seen 'em?

1528
01:16:06.287 --> 01:16:07.736
Stare at you, and

1529
01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.080
they know.

1530
01:16:12.287 --> 01:16:16.251
So, you wanna keep
talking about your miracles?


1531
01:16:16.253 --> 01:16:18.078
It was a miracle.

1532
01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:21.046
Obviously not,
because we're here.


1533
01:16:22.253 --> 01:16:23.803
It was a miracle.

1534
01:16:23.805 --> 01:16:25.837
You weren't there,
you didn't see it.


1535
01:16:25.839 --> 01:16:28.285
And neither did
you, 'cause your eyes,


1536
01:16:28.287 --> 01:16:31.147
like your car, don't work.

1537
01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:33.906
And what kind of god miracles
get you out of trouble


1538
01:16:33.908 --> 01:16:37.251
only to get you back
into the same trouble?


1539
01:16:37.253 --> 01:16:39.734
Look, I don't know
how they found us, okay?


1540
01:16:39.736 --> 01:16:42.078
We put a tracker on your car.

1541
01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:46.736
They put a tracker on your
piece of junk defective car!


1542
01:16:51.977 --> 01:16:54.632
So, you gonna kill us or what?

1543
01:16:55.667 --> 01:16:57.113
You're looking the wrong way.

1544
01:16:57.115 --> 01:16:58.044
What?

1545
01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.768
He's over there.

1546
01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:00.770
Oh.

1547
01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:02.874
Same question.

1548
01:17:04.115 --> 01:17:08.770
When Primo's
mad, things tend to die.


1549
01:17:10.184 --> 01:17:11.803
We used to have
goldfish in here,


1550
01:17:11.805 --> 01:17:14.320
but they're gone now.

1551
01:17:14.322 --> 01:17:15.322
Oh man.

1552
01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:21.182
Where's the girl?

1553
01:17:21.184 --> 01:17:22.803
She's in the back.

1554
01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.561
Primo'll be here any minute.

1555
01:17:24.563 --> 01:17:26.458
We gotta think of something.

1556
01:17:27.805 --> 01:17:30.561
We gotta come up with a plan.

1557
01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:32.837
I think we need
to talk about Jesus.


1558
01:17:32.839 --> 01:17:33.839
What?

1559
01:17:34.874 --> 01:17:36.941
We might be meeting
him here any minute.


1560
01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:38.389
It's just a really
confusing day,


1561
01:17:38.391 --> 01:17:41.320
it's put me into a very
contemplative state.


1562
01:17:41.322 --> 01:17:43.115
We need a real plan.

1563
01:17:44.701 --> 01:17:46.216
What do you want from me?

1564
01:17:46.218 --> 01:17:47.837
Are you wanting to shimmy?

1565
01:17:47.839 --> 01:17:49.113
We can shimmy.

1566
01:17:49.115 --> 01:17:50.527
I can't see where
the heck I'm going,


1567
01:17:50.529 --> 01:17:52.837
but if that's what you
wanna do, I'll give it a go.


1568
01:17:52.839 --> 01:17:55.803
Maybe they won't notice us as
we just shimmy on out of here.


1569
01:17:55.805 --> 01:17:58.389
But we, we can't just sit here.

1570
01:17:58.391 --> 01:18:01.872
That is literally all we can do.

1571
01:18:01.874 --> 01:18:03.251
Now just calm down.

1572
01:18:03.253 --> 01:18:04.423
What?

1573
01:18:04.425 --> 01:18:07.010
What do you mean, calm down?

1574
01:18:07.012 --> 01:18:10.529
I don't know, man,
just all the miracles.


1575
01:18:11.529 --> 01:18:13.423
It's very confusing, I just,

1576
01:18:13.425 --> 01:18:15.561
I think things
are gonna be okay.


1577
01:18:15.563 --> 01:18:18.251
You have lost your mind.

1578
01:18:18.253 --> 01:18:19.356
Read my lips.

1579
01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.529
There was no miracle tonight.

1580
01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:26.354
I can't see your lips, man,

1581
01:18:26.356 --> 01:18:29.251
I can't see, you're
a giant blob.


1582
01:18:39.391 --> 01:18:42.216
Okay, so let's
get this straight.


1583
01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:44.699
I kidnapped the girl,

1584
01:18:44.701 --> 01:18:49.320
you two tried to sell me
lotions instead of guns,


1585
01:18:49.322 --> 01:18:50.322
I shoot you,

1586
01:18:52.287 --> 01:18:56.943
and you figure your best play
is to re-kidnap this girl?


1587
01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:01.630
I really think we're just
having a misunderstanding.


1588
01:19:01.632 --> 01:19:03.113
What did you think
was gonna happen?


1589
01:19:03.115 --> 01:19:05.113
I really don't know.

1590
01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:06.115
Okay.

1591
01:19:07.287 --> 01:19:08.561
Which one of you
wants to die first?


1592
01:19:08.563 --> 01:19:09.665
It was an accident!

1593
01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:10.941
Please don't! Don't!

1594
01:19:10.943 --> 01:19:11.941
She just climbed
in the car, man!


1595
01:19:11.943 --> 01:19:12.837
- Eeny.
- Oh my god.


1596
01:19:12.839 --> 01:19:14.113
You can't control kids,

1597
01:19:14.115 --> 01:19:15.147
- they're crazy.
- Your miracles are the worst!


1598
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:16.182
- Meeny.
- We're sorry,


1599
01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:17.423
we're sorry about the lotion.

1600
01:19:17.425 --> 01:19:18.630
I was supposed to be a doctor,

1601
01:19:18.632 --> 01:19:20.285
but I was scared of the bodies.

1602
01:19:20.287 --> 01:19:21.113
We're sorry!

1603
01:19:21.115 --> 01:19:21.941
Miny.

1604
01:19:21.943 --> 01:19:23.147
But I think I can.

1605
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.941
I've got five kids at home, man!

1606
01:19:23.943 --> 01:19:25.147
I just wanna try.

1607
01:19:25.149 --> 01:19:26.423
- Katie's gonna be so mad!
- Mo.


1608
01:19:26.425 --> 01:19:27.630
- Please don't, don't.
- We didn't even finish


1609
01:19:27.632 --> 01:19:29.527
the documentary
she was watching.


1610
01:19:29.529 --> 01:19:31.458
You are getting me killed!

1611
01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.285
Don't do it, no, no!

1612
01:19:39.839 --> 01:19:42.596
This is why I need a new gun!

1613
01:19:42.598 --> 01:19:43.423
We're alive!

1614
01:19:43.425 --> 01:19:44.667
Tebo!

1615
01:19:49.839 --> 01:19:51.527
Yeah, see, see!

1616
01:19:51.529 --> 01:19:53.147
This is what I'm talking about.

1617
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:55.941
Nice handle, smooth grip,

1618
01:19:55.943 --> 01:19:57.665
heavy so you know
it means business.


1619
01:19:57.667 --> 01:20:00.632
Also, made in
America, just like me.


1620
01:20:01.667 --> 01:20:03.458
And you know what else?

1621
01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.943
Like me, this dog has to bark.

1622
01:20:07.943 --> 01:20:09.458
No, no, no, please!

1623
01:20:24.943 --> 01:20:25.943
What?

1624
01:20:32.322 --> 01:20:33.322
Miracle!

1625
01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:37.113
Well, this is worse.

1626
01:20:37.115 --> 01:20:40.113
Yo, this 5G thing is a joke.

1627
01:20:40.115 --> 01:20:42.113
I'm paying 15 extra
bucks a month for it,


1628
01:20:42.115 --> 01:20:43.630
and I ain't got
nothing out here.


1629
01:20:43.632 --> 01:20:45.941
Who looks at a bat, and thinks,

1630
01:20:45.943 --> 01:20:47.596
"Yeah, I'll eat that."

1631
01:20:47.598 --> 01:20:49.768
Ain't no bat start this virus.

1632
01:20:49.770 --> 01:20:51.941
It's just a story, mind control.

1633
01:20:51.943 --> 01:20:53.527
You mean telepathy.

1634
01:20:53.529 --> 01:20:56.906
There's no bats in
telepathy, it's a gift.


1635
01:20:56.908 --> 01:20:58.251
You're born with it.

1636
01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:01.389
Dude, I'm saying
it's a narrative.


1637
01:21:01.391 --> 01:21:02.734
They want people to look one way

1638
01:21:02.736 --> 01:21:04.147
just so that they can create

1639
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:05.561
some crazy stuff
to put out there,


1640
01:21:05.563 --> 01:21:07.837
just like that street magician
that stole your wallet.


1641
01:21:07.839 --> 01:21:09.906
But that is just a distraction.

1642
01:21:09.908 --> 01:21:11.665
You need to wise up, my man.

1643
01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:14.149
Well, if it's a distraction,

1644
01:21:15.598 --> 01:21:18.667
what is it they
don't want us to see?


1645
01:21:20.184 --> 01:21:21.494
And who is they?

1646
01:21:22.908 --> 01:21:26.529
That's the entire
thing, that's the point.


1647
01:21:30.736 --> 01:21:32.667
So how you wanna do it?

1648
01:21:35.046 --> 01:21:38.699
You know, I'm gonna
find a stick or something.


1649
01:21:38.701 --> 01:21:40.527
This is all your fault.

1650
01:21:41.667 --> 01:21:42.699
Ow!

1651
01:21:42.701 --> 01:21:44.010
How is it my fault?

1652
01:21:44.012 --> 01:21:47.010
I told you to
leave, but you didn't.


1653
01:21:47.012 --> 01:21:49.044
I told you the hairs
were going up on my neck,


1654
01:21:49.046 --> 01:21:51.216
and you told me I
had a condition.


1655
01:21:51.218 --> 01:21:53.699
- It was rule number three!
- Ow, ow, ow, dude!


1656
01:21:53.701 --> 01:21:55.665
I don't think it was
rule number three, man.


1657
01:21:55.667 --> 01:21:57.010
I don't remember the order!

1658
01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:58.078
We're gonna be okay.

1659
01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.251
No it's not.

1660
01:22:00.253 --> 01:22:01.423
It will!

1661
01:22:01.425 --> 01:22:03.251
I'm gonna die out here.

1662
01:22:03.253 --> 01:22:04.391
I am gonna die

1663
01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:08.837
from selling toilet
paper and lotions.


1664
01:22:08.839 --> 01:22:11.734
All because of a stupid
virus that I never had.


1665
01:22:11.736 --> 01:22:14.423
I just wanted to marble
race with my daughter.


1666
01:22:14.425 --> 01:22:16.423
But no.

1667
01:22:16.425 --> 01:22:19.906
No, you had to
talk me into this!


1668
01:22:19.908 --> 01:22:21.734
Isn't Aaliyah like 17?

1669
01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:23.216
That's not the point.

1670
01:22:23.218 --> 01:22:24.113
It's gonna be
okay, you gotta chill out.


1671
01:22:24.115 --> 01:22:25.768
We've had two miracles.

1672
01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:28.423
Miracles come in
threes, we got one more.


1673
01:22:28.425 --> 01:22:29.906
It is bad things!

1674
01:22:29.908 --> 01:22:31.561
Bad things that come in threes.

1675
01:22:31.563 --> 01:22:33.699
What if we use the van?

1676
01:22:33.701 --> 01:22:35.734
It's a bit morbid, you know?

1677
01:22:35.736 --> 01:22:38.872
Well, we don't have a
lot of options here, do we?


1678
01:22:38.874 --> 01:22:40.837
It just seems a little dark,

1679
01:22:40.839 --> 01:22:44.251
maybe we could dial
it back a little.


1680
01:22:44.253 --> 01:22:47.389
As if there's a
feel-good way to do this?


1681
01:22:47.391 --> 01:22:51.320
Do you really
think it was a miracle?


1682
01:22:51.322 --> 01:22:52.458
I think so.

1683
01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:53.458
Right.

1684
01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:54.147
Maybe the guns were broken.

1685
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:55.837
Maybe.

1686
01:22:55.839 --> 01:22:58.492
But it is unlikely
for two guns to be broken.


1687
01:22:58.494 --> 01:23:01.320
It does seem very improbable.

1688
01:23:01.322 --> 01:23:03.458
I don't know, there's...

1689
01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:06.561
Look, we could just
leave them here.


1690
01:23:06.563 --> 01:23:10.320
It's a hot day, there's
no one around for miles.


1691
01:23:10.322 --> 01:23:13.184
I saw a pack of
vultures flying in.


1692
01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:17.630
Maybe the vultures
will eat them.


1693
01:23:17.632 --> 01:23:19.561
And you didn't want
this to go too dark?


1694
01:23:22.322 --> 01:23:23.975
Is that a bullet hole?

1695
01:23:23.977 --> 01:23:26.010
That sure looks
like a bullet hole.


1696
01:23:26.012 --> 01:23:27.665
I didn't hear a gun.

1697
01:23:27.667 --> 01:23:29.458
Maybe it's been there
from the beginning.


1698
01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:30.906
What?

1699
01:23:30.908 --> 01:23:31.803
Yeah, like, it was
there from the beginning,


1700
01:23:31.805 --> 01:23:33.113
we just never noticed it.

1701
01:23:33.115 --> 01:23:34.955
I think you would have
remembered that, Skinny.


1702
01:23:36.356 --> 01:23:37.872
I think we're being shot at.

1703
01:23:37.874 --> 01:23:40.010
Yeah, we're being shot
at, genius, what do we do?


1704
01:23:40.012 --> 01:23:42.044
It doesn't make any sense.

1705
01:23:42.046 --> 01:23:43.561
They're still back there.

1706
01:23:43.563 --> 01:23:44.837
What is your point, Skinny?

1707
01:23:44.839 --> 01:23:46.285
Well, if they're
still tied back there,


1708
01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:47.285
how could they shoot at us,

1709
01:23:47.287 --> 01:23:48.492
I mean, it doesn't make sense,

1710
01:23:48.494 --> 01:23:49.774
the trajectory would be all off.

1711
01:23:51.218 --> 01:23:52.665
Maybe they have telepathy.

1712
01:23:52.667 --> 01:23:53.699
Get in the car, let's leave 'em.

1713
01:23:53.701 --> 01:23:54.975
What?

1714
01:23:54.977 --> 01:23:55.803
What if that's what
they want us to do?


1715
01:23:55.805 --> 01:23:57.113
Get in the car, man!

1716
01:24:13.253 --> 01:24:15.251
Now, these don't look
like no Jehovah's Witnesses


1717
01:24:15.253 --> 01:24:16.803
I've ever seen!

1718
01:24:16.805 --> 01:24:19.078
It's a really interesting
tactic that you've chosen.


1719
01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:19.906
- Tactic?
- Sh!


1720
01:24:19.908 --> 01:24:20.908
Sh, sh, sh.

1721
01:24:22.012 --> 01:24:25.182
Listen, this'd be a lot easier

1722
01:24:25.184 --> 01:24:27.078
if you just let
it run its course.


1723
01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.872
I'm not falling for
this Trojan horse thing


1724
01:24:29.874 --> 01:24:31.872
you got going on.

1725
01:24:31.874 --> 01:24:33.182
My, my, my,

1726
01:24:33.184 --> 01:24:35.182
looks like you got
yourself a bleeding bum.


1727
01:24:35.184 --> 01:24:38.665
Yeah, his bum is
bleeding really good.


1728
01:24:38.667 --> 01:24:40.078
I could use a doctor.

1729
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.182
It could be fake.

1730
01:24:44.598 --> 01:24:45.423
Maybe it's real.

1731
01:24:45.425 --> 01:24:46.734
Yes it's real!

1732
01:24:46.736 --> 01:24:48.561
Well, you could
be yelling like that


1733
01:24:48.563 --> 01:24:49.837
if you were acting the part.

1734
01:24:49.839 --> 01:24:51.044
Government would
have trained ya.


1735
01:24:51.046 --> 01:24:52.010
I'm not-

1736
01:24:52.012 --> 01:24:53.492
- You should check it again.

1737
01:24:55.287 --> 01:24:56.216
I don't know.

1738
01:24:56.218 --> 01:24:57.458
What are you doing, man?

1739
01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.906
Bum bleeds for real.

1740
01:24:58.908 --> 01:25:00.803
We're just in need
of a little help.


1741
01:25:00.805 --> 01:25:02.527
Like everybody.

1742
01:25:02.529 --> 01:25:05.285
Well, if you're not government,
you must be Big Pharma.


1743
01:25:05.287 --> 01:25:06.906
Big Pharma?

1744
01:25:06.908 --> 01:25:08.080
Pharm, pharmec,

1745
01:25:10.632 --> 01:25:12.010
pharmecutic,

1746
01:25:12.012 --> 01:25:13.113
you know, medicine!

1747
01:25:13.115 --> 01:25:14.354
I got it.

1748
01:25:14.356 --> 01:25:16.113
They inject you with something?

1749
01:25:16.115 --> 01:25:17.803
You know, they're pushing
this whole vaccine


1750
01:25:17.805 --> 01:25:19.596
for this virus and
everybody knows


1751
01:25:19.598 --> 01:25:22.182
this virus is just a hoax.

1752
01:25:22.184 --> 01:25:24.044
It's 5G that's
killing everybody!


1753
01:25:24.046 --> 01:25:28.354
Hell, we blew up the tower on
our own property, just pew!


1754
01:25:28.356 --> 01:25:30.147
That sounds very responsible.

1755
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:33.010
You look like government,
especially the big fella.


1756
01:25:33.012 --> 01:25:36.147
We ain't got no love
for government here.


1757
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:38.320
Well Felicity,

1758
01:25:38.322 --> 01:25:41.975
those don't look like any
coyotes I've ever seen.


1759
01:25:41.977 --> 01:25:43.285
No, they do not.

1760
01:25:44.287 --> 01:25:45.458
Come on!

1761
01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.941
Honey pie, I believe
I know these guys.


1762
01:25:46.943 --> 01:25:48.630
What are you doing here?

1763
01:25:48.632 --> 01:25:50.458
We've had a really long day.

1764
01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:51.734
But you're gonna
be playing around


1765
01:25:51.736 --> 01:25:53.492
on the ground like this.

1766
01:25:53.494 --> 01:25:55.285
We have a coyote infestation.

1767
01:25:55.287 --> 01:25:57.665
So you did buy the
gun for your wife.


1768
01:25:57.667 --> 01:25:59.012
Yeah, coyotes.

1769
01:26:00.184 --> 01:26:01.699
I got sensitive ears.

1770
01:26:01.701 --> 01:26:03.078
Hey, you boys wanna come
up to the house for tea.


1771
01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.561
Not in a million years.

1772
01:26:04.563 --> 01:26:07.354
We've got plans, we have
somewhere we gotta be.


1773
01:26:07.356 --> 01:26:08.492
We do?

1774
01:26:08.494 --> 01:26:09.734
Yes we do.

1775
01:26:09.736 --> 01:26:11.561
Where are we supposed to be?

1776
01:26:11.563 --> 01:26:13.665
We gotta go save
that little girl.


1777
01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:14.975
We just got out of trouble

1778
01:26:14.977 --> 01:26:16.492
and you wanna go back there?

1779
01:26:16.494 --> 01:26:18.837
You want to leave that
girl there with Primo?


1780
01:26:18.839 --> 01:26:20.975
What is this, some rescue
operation or something?


1781
01:26:20.977 --> 01:26:21.803
Yes.

1782
01:26:21.805 --> 01:26:23.251
No.

1783
01:26:23.253 --> 01:26:24.078
He's crazy.

1784
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.596
Do you need help?

1785
01:26:25.598 --> 01:26:28.354
'Cause I've got that RPG that
I've been just dying to use.


1786
01:26:28.356 --> 01:26:29.665
Oh yeah, he traded
our car for it.


1787
01:26:29.667 --> 01:26:31.458
Almost blew up our house.

1788
01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.354
You know what?

1789
01:26:33.356 --> 01:26:37.736
We've got a plan, I think
we'll give it a shot first.


1790
01:26:40.736 --> 01:26:42.699
Don't say it like that.

1791
01:26:42.701 --> 01:26:44.874
Now buddy, that's three.

1792
01:26:45.736 --> 01:26:46.561
Three?

1793
01:26:46.563 --> 01:26:47.803
Three what?

1794
01:26:47.805 --> 01:26:48.805
Miracles.

1795
01:26:50.184 --> 01:26:51.874
I've had an epiphany.

1796
01:26:53.529 --> 01:26:55.389
I thought there were only two.

1797
01:26:55.391 --> 01:26:58.423
No, I'm counting the
crazy coyote people.


1798
01:26:58.425 --> 01:26:59.768
They can say it's a coincidence,

1799
01:26:59.770 --> 01:27:03.529
but I don't think we can
say that now, can we?


1800
01:27:10.115 --> 01:27:13.630
We're outside in the
middle of nowhere, buddy.


1801
01:27:13.632 --> 01:27:15.492
Man, this virus, it just,

1802
01:27:15.494 --> 01:27:18.734
you know, I just, I
don't know what's safe


1803
01:27:18.736 --> 01:27:19.596
and what's not safe.

1804
01:27:19.598 --> 01:27:21.458
That's the epiphany.

1805
01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:24.975
There's nothing
safe in this world.


1806
01:27:24.977 --> 01:27:28.768
You can wear a mask
and get hit by a bus.


1807
01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:30.975
And you can not wear a mask

1808
01:27:30.977 --> 01:27:33.975
and also get hit by a bus.

1809
01:27:33.977 --> 01:27:35.561
Sounds like you got
a problem with buses.


1810
01:27:35.563 --> 01:27:38.044
Look, I saw all
the people panicking,


1811
01:27:38.046 --> 01:27:40.216
crippled by their fear,
putting their faith


1812
01:27:40.218 --> 01:27:41.458
in little itchy pieces of paper.

1813
01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:43.906
And I thought, "Look at
'em, they're all scared."


1814
01:27:43.908 --> 01:27:45.425
I'm not like that."

1815
01:27:46.805 --> 01:27:49.734
I guess it turns out
I'm no different at all.


1816
01:27:49.736 --> 01:27:52.734
Yeah, but you aren't
really afraid of the virus.


1817
01:27:52.736 --> 01:27:54.012
I was scared.

1818
01:27:55.943 --> 01:27:59.803
Not of the 'rona, but
of everything else.


1819
01:27:59.805 --> 01:28:02.837
Losing my job,
becoming destitute,


1820
01:28:02.839 --> 01:28:05.492
and trying to
provide for a family.


1821
01:28:05.494 --> 01:28:08.977
I started a company
scalping toilet paper!


1822
01:28:10.701 --> 01:28:13.527
Selling little itty
bottles of lotion!


1823
01:28:13.529 --> 01:28:16.287
Getting shot in
the behind of me!


1824
01:28:18.218 --> 01:28:19.977
Because I was scared.

1825
01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:25.285
So do you want the mask
or do you not want the mask?


1826
01:28:25.287 --> 01:28:27.906
Mask, no mask, the
masks aren't the point.


1827
01:28:27.908 --> 01:28:32.665
There's always gonna be
another reason to be afraid.


1828
01:28:32.667 --> 01:28:35.630
But we get to choose how
we deal with the fear.


1829
01:28:35.632 --> 01:28:37.561
You know, a virus comes to town,

1830
01:28:37.563 --> 01:28:40.389
we choose how we're
gonna respond.


1831
01:28:40.391 --> 01:28:42.941
Bad things happen in our world,

1832
01:28:42.943 --> 01:28:44.527
and we choose how
we're gonna behave


1833
01:28:44.529 --> 01:28:46.320
and what we're gonna do.

1834
01:28:46.322 --> 01:28:49.320
You know, a bad guy
points a gun to our heads


1835
01:28:49.322 --> 01:28:53.285
and takes that little
girl, and we choose.


1836
01:28:53.287 --> 01:28:56.598
Are we gonna run, or
are we gonna fight?


1837
01:29:00.598 --> 01:29:03.149
To live in fear, it's a choice,

1838
01:29:05.218 --> 01:29:08.598
so I think it's time
we stopped doing it.


1839
01:29:09.598 --> 01:29:12.423
Do you have to be so close.

1840
01:29:12.425 --> 01:29:15.044
I can't see you unless
you're right there.


1841
01:29:15.046 --> 01:29:16.078
Oh.

1842
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:17.080
You're a blob.

1843
01:29:24.287 --> 01:29:25.734
Hey, Barker.

1844
01:29:25.736 --> 01:29:27.216
Hey, I heard about
what happened,


1845
01:29:27.218 --> 01:29:29.182
you missing your
daughter the other day.


1846
01:29:29.184 --> 01:29:31.285
Ooh, yeah, that was horrible.

1847
01:29:31.287 --> 01:29:34.872
Hey, listen though, I can
help you out with that.


1848
01:29:34.874 --> 01:29:36.596
I could grease some
gears, you know?


1849
01:29:36.598 --> 01:29:38.354
Maybe find out what
happened to her.


1850
01:29:38.356 --> 01:29:39.356
But listen,

1851
01:29:41.046 --> 01:29:44.389
as soon as that paycheck
protection program money comes in,


1852
01:29:44.391 --> 01:29:47.044
I'm gonna need you to
send some of that my way.


1853
01:29:47.046 --> 01:29:49.356
Consider it my finder's fee.

1854
01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:55.941
Why you looking like that?

1855
01:29:55.943 --> 01:29:57.113
Like what?

1856
01:29:57.115 --> 01:29:57.941
Like that.

1857
01:29:57.943 --> 01:29:58.906
Like what?

1858
01:29:58.908 --> 01:30:00.216
Like that.

1859
01:30:00.218 --> 01:30:04.010
This is the
face I make at meanos.


1860
01:30:08.598 --> 01:30:10.527
Are you sure we
don't need protection?


1861
01:30:10.529 --> 01:30:11.529
No guns.

1862
01:30:12.839 --> 01:30:15.872
What do I do if they see me?

1863
01:30:15.874 --> 01:30:17.803
Your name is Punch.

1864
01:30:17.805 --> 01:30:21.080
But I've never
really punched anybody.


1865
01:30:22.356 --> 01:30:23.872
Then why do they call you Punch?

1866
01:30:23.874 --> 01:30:26.389
Punch, like the juice.

1867
01:30:26.391 --> 01:30:28.147
The fruity kind.

1868
01:30:28.149 --> 01:30:31.389
I had a little addiction when
I was in elementary school,


1869
01:30:31.391 --> 01:30:32.872
and I was a little overweight,

1870
01:30:32.874 --> 01:30:34.078
and I had a great mustache,

1871
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.216
and I just, I really
never got over it.


1872
01:30:37.218 --> 01:30:40.216
What is the point of
having all these muscles


1873
01:30:40.218 --> 01:30:41.872
if you can't even hit a guy?

1874
01:30:41.874 --> 01:30:45.285
Look, I could do
it, but theoretically,


1875
01:30:45.287 --> 01:30:46.734
I don't understand
the mechanics.


1876
01:30:46.736 --> 01:30:50.837
Oh my gosh, you just
swing your arms, man.


1877
01:30:53.184 --> 01:30:54.184
Really?

1878
01:30:54.874 --> 01:30:56.630
She was saying mean things.

1879
01:30:56.632 --> 01:30:59.115
Your momma says mean things.

1880
01:31:01.012 --> 01:31:03.423
I don't know if that's
really necessary, I mean,


1881
01:31:03.425 --> 01:31:06.837
the whole point is to
not let the virus get in.


1882
01:31:06.839 --> 01:31:10.977
But it doesn't come in
through the eye holes, man.


1883
01:31:16.494 --> 01:31:19.943
Don't worry about it,
I'll go check it out.


1884
01:32:32.012 --> 01:32:33.665
Okay, I'm gonna
take your mask off,


1885
01:32:33.667 --> 01:32:35.667
just don't scream, okay?

1886
01:32:39.529 --> 01:32:41.494
Your face looks funny.

1887
01:32:45.184 --> 01:32:48.389
Okay, I'm gonna have to go
get some scissors, all right?


1888
01:32:48.391 --> 01:32:51.596
You're not really
good at rescues.


1889
01:32:51.598 --> 01:32:55.078
Well, it's an A for
effort though, right?


1890
01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:58.218
You aren't really
trying that hard.


1891
01:33:19.529 --> 01:33:20.529
You!

1892
01:33:29.736 --> 01:33:33.354
I did it!

1893
01:33:33.356 --> 01:33:34.216
What?

1894
01:33:34.218 --> 01:33:36.251
I punched him!

1895
01:33:36.253 --> 01:33:37.941
He is out cold!

1896
01:33:37.943 --> 01:33:39.734
That's great!

1897
01:33:39.736 --> 01:33:41.251
Help me find some scissors.

1898
01:33:41.253 --> 01:33:44.734
Oh man, I'm like, er, I'm
like a one punch machine!


1899
01:33:44.736 --> 01:33:48.423
I'm like Mike Tyson, but you
know, with a deeper voice.


1900
01:33:48.425 --> 01:33:53.391
Oh, I popped
him square in the nose.


1901
01:33:55.115 --> 01:33:56.527
But there's blood.

1902
01:33:56.529 --> 01:33:58.012
Don't you dare.

1903
01:34:01.322 --> 01:34:03.596
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding me, man!


1904
01:34:03.598 --> 01:34:04.598
Hey!

1905
01:34:31.391 --> 01:34:34.320
You just won't die.

1906
01:34:34.322 --> 01:34:37.012
Here I have a job,
I have a plan,


1907
01:34:38.977 --> 01:34:42.012
and you just keep
getting in the way.


1908
01:34:51.529 --> 01:34:53.699
Have I given you the tour yet?

1909
01:34:53.701 --> 01:34:56.354
Oh, well how rude of me.

1910
01:34:56.356 --> 01:34:58.563
This is the factory floor.

1911
01:34:59.598 --> 01:35:01.216
Over there, we have an office.

1912
01:35:01.218 --> 01:35:03.044
Over there, we've
got a bathroom,


1913
01:35:03.046 --> 01:35:05.837
but the piece de resistance is,

1914
01:35:05.839 --> 01:35:08.184
let me show you, the freezer.

1915
01:35:09.287 --> 01:35:11.803
It's minus 30 degrees in there.

1916
01:35:11.805 --> 01:35:15.458
We use it to instantly
freeze the pies.


1917
01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:18.943
Good for the pies, bad
for the human body.


1918
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:23.529
Oh yeah, it's chilly.

1919
01:35:24.391 --> 01:35:25.494
Slippery too.

1920
01:35:26.425 --> 01:35:28.734
Gotta watch yourself.

1921
01:35:28.736 --> 01:35:32.701
So there you go, this
concludes our little tour.


1922
01:35:34.218 --> 01:35:36.389
Thank you for your
participation.


1923
01:35:36.391 --> 01:35:37.425
Safe travels.

1924
01:35:42.805 --> 01:35:44.906
Is this really all
you got, little man?


1925
01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.805
Hey man, you dead?

1926
01:36:03.736 --> 01:36:04.736
Okay.

1927
01:36:05.632 --> 01:36:06.805
You chill out.

1928
01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.425
What took you so long?

1929
01:36:27.736 --> 01:36:29.596
I was taking a tour.

1930
01:36:30.563 --> 01:36:31.908
It's time to go.

1931
01:36:33.943 --> 01:36:35.078
What happened to you?

1932
01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.734
You failed me, man.

1933
01:36:36.736 --> 01:36:38.803
I had to take on Primo alone.

1934
01:36:38.805 --> 01:36:39.734
Where is he?

1935
01:36:39.736 --> 01:36:41.389
Oh, I whipped him.

1936
01:36:41.391 --> 01:36:42.320
What?

1937
01:36:42.322 --> 01:36:44.320
Yeah, I'm super strong.

1938
01:36:44.322 --> 01:36:45.527
What's that?

1939
01:36:45.529 --> 01:36:47.354
That's Primo, I locked
him in the freezer.


1940
01:36:47.356 --> 01:36:49.253
He needed to chill out.

1941
01:36:50.322 --> 01:36:51.596
Hi there.

1942
01:36:51.598 --> 01:36:53.458
The missing girl is here.

1943
01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:56.667
Also, illegal weapons
too, lots of 'em.


1944
01:36:57.874 --> 01:36:59.734
The serial numbers
are filed off,


1945
01:36:59.736 --> 01:37:04.216
and probably murder weapons
and, you know, everything.


1946
01:37:04.218 --> 01:37:07.184
Um, you better send
SWAT and the DEA


1947
01:37:08.425 --> 01:37:12.147
and just send all the
police and everybody.


1948
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:13.872
Okay kiddo, this is it.

1949
01:37:13.874 --> 01:37:15.251
Police are on their way,
they'll be here any minute,


1950
01:37:15.253 --> 01:37:17.494
so go and have a good life.

1951
01:37:18.494 --> 01:37:20.354
I changed my mind.

1952
01:37:20.356 --> 01:37:22.182
You did? About what?

1953
01:37:22.184 --> 01:37:25.115
You two look
essential after all.


1954
01:37:26.184 --> 01:37:28.218
Well, that's very nice.

1955
01:37:29.184 --> 01:37:31.356
The juries are still out.

1956
01:37:32.563 --> 01:37:35.320
I love these little
chats that we have.


1957
01:37:35.322 --> 01:37:37.527
Here, talk to the police lady.

1958
01:37:37.529 --> 01:37:39.010
Hello.

1959
01:37:39.012 --> 01:37:40.320
Hi.

1960
01:37:40.322 --> 01:37:41.977
Do you like bunnies.

1961
01:37:46.046 --> 01:37:47.046
Well man.

1962
01:37:51.701 --> 01:37:53.182
Let's go home.

1963
01:37:53.184 --> 01:37:56.596
Man, I'm gonna build,
like, the best marble race.


1964
01:37:56.598 --> 01:38:00.078
Yes you are, it's gonna be
the greatest marble race ever.


1965
01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.596
And Aaliyah will love
it even though she's 17.


1966
01:38:02.598 --> 01:38:03.768
She probably loves
marbles, I mean,


1967
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:06.285
what 17 year old
doesn't love marbles?


1968
01:38:06.287 --> 01:38:08.389
I mean, they're so fun.

1969
01:38:08.391 --> 01:38:10.113
And I will go home
and play zombie ducks,


1970
01:38:10.115 --> 01:38:11.941
and I will explain
everything to Katie,


1971
01:38:11.943 --> 01:38:13.872
she will still love me
and I'm gonna stay married


1972
01:38:13.874 --> 01:38:14.941
because we cannot
let your mother


1973
01:38:14.943 --> 01:38:16.803
be right now, can we Punch?

1974
01:38:16.805 --> 01:38:17.805
We cannot.

1975
01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:24.285
Nope, we will win best father
awards together, you and me.


1976
01:38:24.287 --> 01:38:27.078
You with your marbles,
and me with my-


1977
01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.044
- Dude!

1978
01:38:28.046 --> 01:38:30.734
What is wrong with your car?

1979
01:38:33.943 --> 01:38:35.216
Daddy.

1980
01:38:36.908 --> 01:38:38.908
Do we have time to play?

1981
01:38:40.425 --> 01:38:43.046
Buddy, I've got some bad news.

1982
01:38:44.425 --> 01:38:46.147
The zombie ducks
are already coming,


1983
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:47.941
look, they nearly got
me on my way home!


1984
01:38:47.943 --> 01:38:50.078
Ooh, does that hurt?

1985
01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:52.285
Yeah, it hurts a lot.

1986
01:38:52.287 --> 01:38:53.699
So you know what I
think we should do?


1987
01:38:53.701 --> 01:38:55.251
What?

1988
01:38:55.253 --> 01:38:56.941
We should get everybody
downstairs to the table right now.


1989
01:38:56.943 --> 01:38:59.149
- Yes!
- To deal with them.


1990
01:39:06.701 --> 01:39:10.216
I'm really glad
you're home, Daddy.


1991
01:39:10.218 --> 01:39:11.872
I'm glad to be home, buddy.

1992
01:39:11.874 --> 01:39:12.699
You know what?

1993
01:39:12.701 --> 01:39:13.872
What?

1994
01:39:13.874 --> 01:39:16.805
I'm gonna stay
home, for a long time.


1995
01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:20.492
All right, here we go,

1996
01:39:20.494 --> 01:39:22.630
the moment that you guys
have been waiting for.


1997
01:39:22.632 --> 01:39:24.630
Look at this amazing track.

1998
01:39:24.632 --> 01:39:26.803
Aaliyah babe, are you ready?

1999
01:39:26.805 --> 01:39:27.630
Coming.

2000
01:39:27.632 --> 01:39:29.010
All right!

2001
01:39:29.012 --> 01:39:32.115
The famous marble
race, and the star,


2002
01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:37.354
yep, and myself!

2003
01:39:37.356 --> 01:39:39.665
All right, what do we have here?

2004
01:39:39.667 --> 01:39:40.667
Oh yeah.

2005
01:39:42.046 --> 01:39:43.356
It's going down!

2006
01:39:45.149 --> 01:39:46.389
It is going down.

2007
01:39:46.391 --> 01:39:47.527
What do we have here?

2008
01:39:47.529 --> 01:39:49.285
Oh yeah, look at those.

2009
01:39:49.287 --> 01:39:50.665
All right!

2010
01:39:50.667 --> 01:39:52.768
Which one do you
think's gonna win, babe?


2011
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:54.182
Silver.

2012
01:39:54.184 --> 01:39:57.699
Okay, yes, silver bullet.

2013
01:39:57.701 --> 01:40:00.320
All right, here we go.

2014
01:40:00.322 --> 01:40:02.216
Here we get ready to start.

2015
01:40:02.218 --> 01:40:04.389
Look at this thing here,
this is so creative.


2016
01:40:04.391 --> 01:40:06.044
Look at this.

2017
01:40:06.046 --> 01:40:08.044
Me and my babe did that.

2018
01:40:08.046 --> 01:40:09.423
All right.

2019
01:40:09.425 --> 01:40:10.975
And...

2020
01:40:15.115 --> 01:40:16.770
Wait, yep, um, um...

2021
01:40:20.184 --> 01:40:21.184
Um...

2022
01:40:23.598 --> 01:40:25.975
That was fun.

2023
01:40:25.977 --> 01:40:26.977
Um...

2024
01:40:28.701 --> 01:40:29.701
Yeah.

2025
01:40:31.598 --> 01:40:32.975
What's up, man?

2026
01:40:32.977 --> 01:40:33.872
What's up man?

2027
01:40:33.874 --> 01:40:34.630
- Cheers.
- How are you?


2028
01:40:34.632 --> 01:40:35.492
Cheers.

2029
01:40:35.494 --> 01:40:36.803
Man, it's really awesome

2030
01:40:36.805 --> 01:40:38.872
that Uncle Bernie let
you borrow the place.


2031
01:40:38.874 --> 01:40:40.182
Yeah, I don't think
we'll ever go back.


2032
01:40:40.184 --> 01:40:41.216
Yeah.

2033
01:40:41.218 --> 01:40:42.941
So, did you do the marble race?

2034
01:40:42.943 --> 01:40:44.113
Was it awesome?

2035
01:40:44.115 --> 01:40:45.389
Awesome!

2036
01:40:45.391 --> 01:40:49.044
It was great, and
I had so much run,


2037
01:40:49.046 --> 01:40:51.182
I had forgot to push record,

2038
01:40:51.184 --> 01:40:53.665
but yeah, you
know, it was great.


2039
01:40:53.667 --> 01:40:54.941
Lame.

2040
01:40:54.943 --> 01:40:55.803
That's kind of a
bummer after all that.


2041
01:40:55.805 --> 01:40:56.768
Yeah.

2042
01:40:56.770 --> 01:40:57.768
So what are you gonna do now?

2043
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:59.389
You know, we got all this time.

2044
01:40:59.391 --> 01:41:01.010
You know, I've actually
been thinking about that,


2045
01:41:01.012 --> 01:41:03.044
you know, I've got
all these people


2046
01:41:03.046 --> 01:41:05.734
that are wanting to train
at the track, and...


2047
01:41:17.943 --> 01:41:19.561
I feel hot, come here,
come here, feel me.


2048
01:41:19.563 --> 01:41:21.872
- I feel hot.
- I can't feel you, man!


2049
01:41:21.874 --> 01:41:24.908
Gotcha!

2050
01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:30.734
That's so funny.

2051
01:41:30.736 --> 01:41:35.596
Oh, you should've seen
your face.


2052
01:41:35.598 --> 01:41:37.389
That's not cool, man.

2053
01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:39.527
That was mean, that
was really mean man.


2054
01:41:39.529 --> 01:41:42.216
I was having genuine
feelings about you just then,


2055
01:41:42.218 --> 01:41:44.078
genuine concern welling up.

2056
01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:47.527
Dude, I had to man, I
just, like, really, I had to.


2057
01:41:47.529 --> 01:41:50.078
My kids could
have been out here.


2058
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:51.837
They could have been out
here, if they had seen that,


2059
01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:52.768
they would be crying right now,

2060
01:41:52.770 --> 01:41:54.285
there'd be sobbing everywhere.

2061
01:41:54.287 --> 01:41:56.872
"Daddy, Punch is gonna die,"
it'd just be really bad.


2062
01:41:56.874 --> 01:41:58.803
You gotta think
about that kind stuff
