1
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.037
Come on in, sit down.

2
00:00:15.072 --> 00:00:16.841
You can just sit
on the floor.


3
00:00:17.343 --> 00:00:19.349
It's fine. You look better
down there anyway.


4
00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.419
You wanna

5
00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:25.256
experience me again?

6
00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:27.786
Just tell me
what you're into.


7
00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:33.627
Alexandra Snow,

8
00:00:33.662 --> 00:00:34.925
she's a very
well managed brand.


9
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.531
She's a professional person

10
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.730
and she's very good
at her craft.


11
00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:40.964
The moment she came onto
our site, we're very honored.


12
00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.603
She's a very big name.

13
00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:44.407
Mm, you love this.

14
00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:47.872
I always admire women
that have a good hustle


15
00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:49.610
and do really well
very quickly,


16
00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:50.941
and she had that, like,
right outta the gate.


17
00:00:50.976 --> 00:00:52.547
What's wrong?

18
00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:54.351
You don't wanna disclose

19
00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:57.552
all your deepest,
darkest fantasies?


20
00:00:57.587 --> 00:00:59.389
Take it down.
There we go.


21
00:00:59.424 --> 00:01:02.425
You're doing dirty, filthy,
kinky, wonderful things,


22
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.560
and it gives us
the spice that we need.


23
00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:06.957
It's weird,
you sit online


24
00:01:06.992 --> 00:01:08.728
and you, like,
humiliate guys, that...


25
00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:10.862
wanna lick
your dirty feet.


26
00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:14.668
We payout a model just
shy of $35,000 for a month.


27
00:01:14.703 --> 00:01:16.703
I can't
guarantee that I'll take


28
00:01:16.738 --> 00:01:18.342
good care of you,

29
00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:20.872
but I will be
exceedingly thorough.


30
00:01:20.907 --> 00:01:22.742
It's making, you know,

31
00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:25.041
a lot of girls
successful and happy,


32
00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:26.746
and it's making
a lot of guys realize


33
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:28.946
that they need
to bow down.


34
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:34.083
I'm gonna break you into
the smallest little pieces


35
00:01:34.118 --> 00:01:37.988
and reassemble you
as something else entirely.


36
00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:46.898
Yeah.
Goes something like that.


37
00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:05.174
All right,
please say again.


38
00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.980
All right.
Uh, custom JOI CEI clip.


39
00:03:09.582 --> 00:03:11.917
"Please make me follow
your instructions as I jerk off


40
00:03:11.952 --> 00:03:14.656
to you with some humiliation
about what I'm doing for you.


41
00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:16.625
Uh, depending on how
cruel you're feeling,


42
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.990
it's up to you whether or not
I have to ruin my orgasm.


43
00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:21.828
Um, either way, please
make me eat my cum for you


44
00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:23.632
while you give me
a bit of humiliation.


45
00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.634
Please make me thank
you afterwards, thank you.


46
00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.900
Um, and if possible, please
also blow a kiss at the end."


47
00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:29.737
So thank you and the
blowing a kiss at the end


48
00:03:29.772 --> 00:03:31.508
-is what you have to remember.
-Okay.


49
00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:34.203
I'm super in love
with this lens.


50
00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:37.514
I have this, like,
little ritual that I do


51
00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.208
that I get set up,

52
00:03:39.243 --> 00:03:41.078
I look in the camera,
I'm like, "Okay, we're good."


53
00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:42.915
I go and I
turn the camera on.


54
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.489
I go back, I throw my hands
to my hair, I look down


55
00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:46.985
and then it goes.

56
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.822
I-- I have no prep,
there's no nothing.


57
00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:50.791
I've gotten it
down to a science.


58
00:03:56.865 --> 00:04:00.867
You look so cute over
there with your cock so hard.


59
00:04:00.902 --> 00:04:02.737
She draws a lot of it
from herself


60
00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:06.037
and her own experiences,
but, like, she articulates it


61
00:04:06.072 --> 00:04:08.072
in such a way
that makes it fantastic


62
00:04:08.107 --> 00:04:09.744
and draws you
into the fantasy.


63
00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:11.548
I did want to pursue, uh,

64
00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.143
an acting career
at some point,


65
00:04:13.178 --> 00:04:16.718
and I decided to pursue
psychology and IT instead.


66
00:04:16.753 --> 00:04:19.853
I'm really glad that I did
because now I do get to act


67
00:04:19.888 --> 00:04:21.822
and make
way more money


68
00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:23.725
than most actors
will ever get to make.


69
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.595
You like it?

70
00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:31.535
So obviously
a female domination is


71
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.801
the role
of a female


72
00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:36.903
in the dominant
position, right?


73
00:04:36.938 --> 00:04:38.905
There will be

74
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.271
no cumming at all...

75
00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:47.177
until I say otherwise.

76
00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:50.180
Femdom is at its heart.

77
00:04:50.215 --> 00:04:54.019
The empowerment of--
of a woman to be able to have


78
00:04:54.054 --> 00:04:57.220
her pleasure and power,

79
00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.025
have the way that she wants
to have it first and foremost.


80
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.928
Uh, slow.

81
00:05:01.963 --> 00:05:03.798
I would have said
it's gonna hurt more.


82
00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:05.800
It's a bit of a misnomer
because it's like,


83
00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:08.231
the-- the idea is that somehow
femdom is-- is very selfish.


84
00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.706
And-- and the reality
is-- is that it's not,


85
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:14.677
it's just that that's the other
side of masculine culture


86
00:05:14.712 --> 00:05:17.911
that said male
pleasure comes first.


87
00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:20.617
Stroke
for latex Goddess.


88
00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:21.948
Your rubber Queen.

89
00:05:22.918 --> 00:05:24.247
I'm Alexandra Snow.

90
00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.985
I'm a professional dominatrix,

91
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.022
media producer, um,
visionary entrepreneur


92
00:05:30.057 --> 00:05:34.664
and I believe that all of this
is just a grand adventure.


93
00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.226
Good boy!

94
00:05:36.932 --> 00:05:41.165
Down, down, down.

95
00:05:43.774 --> 00:05:45.807
Fucking bug.

96
00:05:50.143 --> 00:05:53.375
There's Dominus Snow
and there's Goddess Snow.


97
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.279
Dominus Snow
is the real life dominatrix.


98
00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.050
She is the real deal.

99
00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:01.383
Does sessions,
interacting with slaves,


100
00:06:01.418 --> 00:06:06.058
like hands on
dominant woman persona.


101
00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.259
And then
there is Goddess Snow


102
00:06:09.294 --> 00:06:11.360
who is more of a, like,
almost a religious deity.


103
00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:14.231
You want us to look
into your future


104
00:06:14.266 --> 00:06:17.003
and by looking
into your future


105
00:06:17.038 --> 00:06:19.368
I became it.

106
00:06:19.403 --> 00:06:22.140
Guys don't have to actually
physically feel their--


107
00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:24.142
her hands on them,
like when they're--


108
00:06:24.177 --> 00:06:26.144
when she's peering
magically into their mind


109
00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:28.212
and making them
jerk off or whatever.


110
00:06:28.647 --> 00:06:30.247
I'm selling
through several different


111
00:06:30.282 --> 00:06:31.985
pay-per-view platforms.

112
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.020
Things like Clips4sale,
Kink Bomb, iWantClips.


113
00:06:34.055 --> 00:06:37.991
And, uh, each one
takes on average, like,


114
00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:40.257
between 40
and 60% commission.


115
00:06:40.292 --> 00:06:42.897
I have six
unique videos per week


116
00:06:42.932 --> 00:06:46.032
therefore I'm less concerned
about how much one video sells,


117
00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:47.968
I'm more concerned
about how all of them sell.


118
00:06:48.003 --> 00:06:49.937
You're ready
to choke it down?


119
00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:52.973
Are you ready to slobber
that whole face full of juice?


120
00:06:53.008 --> 00:06:54.337
I bet it's
right there, isn't it?


121
00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:55.910
-Uh-huh?
-Uh!


122
00:06:55.945 --> 00:06:57.076
Should we give 'em
a countdown?


123
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:58.946
I think we should.

124
00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:01.685
There are so many
different reasons why someone


125
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.248
might be into kinks

126
00:07:04.283 --> 00:07:06.382
and fetishes
and power exchange.


127
00:07:06.417 --> 00:07:09.891
Uh, and it's all,
for the most part, healthy.


128
00:07:09.926 --> 00:07:12.795
-Aw, there we go.

129
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.863
It can also be
very cathartic.


130
00:07:14.898 --> 00:07:17.800
Um, a lot of people
work through trauma


131
00:07:17.835 --> 00:07:21.166
and work through difficult
experiences that they have.


132
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:24.774
It can also be a way to
deal with stress and anxiety.


133
00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:26.941
And again,
it's just fucking sexy.


134
00:07:28.472 --> 00:07:30.406
-Two. Thank you God--

135
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:32.375
One of the biggest
stumbling blocks for folks


136
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.884
is that they have this fear
that if they see a mistress


137
00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.348
that, "Oh, this is--
I'm-- I'm seeing a prostitute.


138
00:07:38.383 --> 00:07:40.757
I'm-- I'm--
I'm seeing a sex worker.


139
00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:43.727
And what if people find out
and-- and this is just bad.


140
00:07:43.762 --> 00:07:44.992
This is dirty."

141
00:07:45.027 --> 00:07:46.356
And, you know,
which goes back


142
00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:48.391
to this really old
belief system


143
00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.228
that women's
sexuality is dirty


144
00:07:50.263 --> 00:07:52.329
and that women's sexuality

145
00:07:52.364 --> 00:07:55.233
is threatening and dangerous
in some way.


146
00:07:55.268 --> 00:07:57.004
Which, you know,
was a really wonderful way


147
00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.138
to keep women at bay

148
00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:01.173
and-- and keep them in their
place by not allowing them


149
00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:02.977
to assert their sexuality
and their sexual power.


150
00:08:03.012 --> 00:08:04.242
<i>We could be more careful.</i>

151
00:08:04.277 --> 00:08:07.982
♪

152
00:08:08.017 --> 00:08:09.852
I was third generation

153
00:08:09.887 --> 00:08:11.348
animal person, right?

154
00:08:11.383 --> 00:08:13.416
My grandmother bred
horses and then dogs


155
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.286
and my mom bred dogs.

156
00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:18.520
And-- and so I was like
raised in a kennel, literally.


157
00:08:18.555 --> 00:08:20.423
Like, that's what--
that's what I did for fun.


158
00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:23.030
Like we-- we went to
dog shows on the weekends.


159
00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:26.000
So first grade,

160
00:08:26.035 --> 00:08:29.201
my grandmother
gets called to the school.


161
00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:32.402
I'd gotten in trouble,
I was in the principal's office


162
00:08:32.437 --> 00:08:34.844
and my grandmother comes in
and she goes,


163
00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:36.439
"What seems to be
the issue?"


164
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:39.475
And the principal
gets up in huff and she says


165
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.150
"Well, she was out there

166
00:08:44.185 --> 00:08:46.020
calling little girls bitches."

167
00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:49.452
And my grandmother
looks at me...


168
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:53.225
and she's like, "What?"

169
00:08:53.794 --> 00:08:56.998
I was like,
"We were playing dog show


170
00:08:57.033 --> 00:09:00.870
and I had them all
on all fours


171
00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:03.301
as dogs running around me
in a circle


172
00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:04.940
'cause I'm the judge."

173
00:09:04.975 --> 00:09:07.404
And my grandmother is like,

174
00:09:07.439 --> 00:09:08.977
"Do you have
a dictionary?"


175
00:09:09.612 --> 00:09:11.342
And, you know,
the principal's like,


176
00:09:11.377 --> 00:09:13.278
all, huff and huff,
gets the dictionary.


177
00:09:13.313 --> 00:09:15.247
"Like, I'd like
to show you that bitch


178
00:09:15.282 --> 00:09:18.118
is the correct term
for female dog.


179
00:09:18.153 --> 00:09:19.823
This is a school
and we're we supposed to be


180
00:09:19.858 --> 00:09:21.319
educating our children."

181
00:09:21.354 --> 00:09:23.959
My grandmother
pulled no punches, right?


182
00:09:23.994 --> 00:09:25.862
And then my grandmother
turns to me and goes,


183
00:09:25.897 --> 00:09:27.391
"Well, who was gonna win?"

184
00:09:27.426 --> 00:09:28.898
And I was like,
"I hadn't got the judging yet."


185
00:09:30.495 --> 00:09:32.165
Remember....

186
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.236
♪

187
00:09:44.443 --> 00:09:46.014
When I first identified

188
00:09:46.049 --> 00:09:47.851
as being
a dominant female,


189
00:09:47.886 --> 00:09:49.347
I thought there was
something wrong with me, right?


190
00:09:49.382 --> 00:09:50.854
Like I--
I genuinely thought there


191
00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:52.383
was something
wrong with me.


192
00:09:52.418 --> 00:09:54.220
I'm having this like,
um, like therapy session


193
00:09:54.255 --> 00:09:55.991
which I'm like pouring
my heart out to this guy.


194
00:09:56.026 --> 00:09:57.553
I thought maybe I was
having an-- an identity


195
00:09:57.588 --> 00:09:59.456
with my gender, like,
I was identifying with


196
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:01.227
all these very masculine,
you know, characteristics,


197
00:10:01.262 --> 00:10:04.428
but yet, um,
still thought I might have


198
00:10:04.463 --> 00:10:06.232
sexual attraction to both.

199
00:10:06.267 --> 00:10:09.037
And I had this--
this doctor laugh at me


200
00:10:09.072 --> 00:10:11.468
and it was just like,
just thought it was so funny.


201
00:10:11.503 --> 00:10:13.239
He was like, "There's
nothing wrong with you.


202
00:10:13.274 --> 00:10:14.570
You're not broken.

203
00:10:14.605 --> 00:10:15.879
You're not
having a gender crisis.


204
00:10:15.914 --> 00:10:17.474
You're just rare.

205
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:19.278
You know, dominant
women tend to be fairly rare


206
00:10:19.313 --> 00:10:22.050
and you don't have
a model for it in society."


207
00:10:22.986 --> 00:10:26.384
There was this,
like, a strange dichotomy


208
00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:30.190
of femdom in which that you're
supposed to feel powerful


209
00:10:30.225 --> 00:10:32.126
wearing hyper
feminine clothing,


210
00:10:32.161 --> 00:10:34.359
but exhibiting
hypermasculine attributes.


211
00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:38.935
I was like,
"Okay, well I suppose


212
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.937
if that's the name
of the game,


213
00:10:40.972 --> 00:10:42.906
I already have a lot of these
characteristics and fuck it.


214
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:44.105
I like--
I like the clothes."


215
00:10:45.274 --> 00:10:49.913
As a femdom we're definitely
giving more scope to gender.


216
00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:51.508
You know, you can play
with these different roles


217
00:10:51.543 --> 00:10:53.345
and experience
the loss of control that


218
00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.918
that role provides.

219
00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:56.612
There we go.
That looks better.


220
00:10:56.647 --> 00:10:59.516
The femdom creates a space
where there's no judgment.


221
00:10:59.918 --> 00:11:02.420
They create a space
where there's no shame.


222
00:11:02.455 --> 00:11:05.060
So the person
has the opportunity


223
00:11:05.095 --> 00:11:07.898
to explore
and create and go, "Huh!


224
00:11:08.533 --> 00:11:10.967
This is what I'm
missing in my day to day,


225
00:11:11.002 --> 00:11:13.002
and this is
what I want here."


226
00:11:13.037 --> 00:11:15.598
And it's
a turn on, right?


227
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:18.403
Because imagine being able
to be in a space


228
00:11:18.438 --> 00:11:20.240
where you can
truly be yourself,


229
00:11:20.275 --> 00:11:22.242
where the person across
from you isn't judging you,


230
00:11:22.277 --> 00:11:24.145
there's no shame or blame.

231
00:11:24.747 --> 00:11:27.379
That's the sexiest place
you can be.


232
00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.351
I actually
got into the adult industry


233
00:11:32.386 --> 00:11:34.683
through dancing,
through erotic dancing.


234
00:11:34.718 --> 00:11:37.125
I took all of
the money that I made


235
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.359
from being a stripper and used
to bankroll my whole business.


236
00:11:42.693 --> 00:11:44.495
I sat down probably

237
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.663
for three or four months
and created a business plan


238
00:11:47.698 --> 00:11:49.566
and then
completely broke apart


239
00:11:49.601 --> 00:11:51.304
everyone's business models
and said, "You know what?


240
00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:52.701
None of you
are doing it the way


241
00:11:52.736 --> 00:11:54.571
that I would wanna do it,"
and I wrote a new one.


242
00:11:57.312 --> 00:11:59.444
I'm a big fan
of medieval bondage


243
00:11:59.479 --> 00:12:01.248
and medieval torture devices,

244
00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:03.349
and I wanted to take
some of these really cool


245
00:12:03.384 --> 00:12:05.549
old medieval plans
and modernize them.


246
00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:07.419
This is my whipping post.

247
00:12:07.454 --> 00:12:10.554
I could really pull someone up
and even off the ground.


248
00:12:11.256 --> 00:12:14.723
I was talking to
a friend about the nature


249
00:12:14.758 --> 00:12:17.231
of opening a dungeon
and she said,


250
00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:19.365
"Wow, it's kind of like
you're creating


251
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.301
this Garden of Eden thing."

252
00:12:21.336 --> 00:12:23.072
And I said, "Ugh.
Yeah, A Wicked Eden."


253
00:12:23.107 --> 00:12:24.733
And she was like,
"That's brilliant!"


254
00:12:24.768 --> 00:12:26.603
And I was like, "Yes,
it absolutely is brilliant."


255
00:12:26.638 --> 00:12:28.440
That's-- that's it.
That's the name.


256
00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:31.575
The training process
at Wicked Eden was intense.


257
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.513
We had to know
how to use every toy


258
00:12:35.548 --> 00:12:37.581
in that dungeon
ten different ways.


259
00:12:37.616 --> 00:12:40.122
We had to know
sanitation procedures.


260
00:12:40.157 --> 00:12:42.784
We had to know,
uh, medical procedures.


261
00:12:42.819 --> 00:12:44.258
Everything that
I teach the girls,


262
00:12:44.293 --> 00:12:45.589
I break into modules.

263
00:12:45.624 --> 00:12:47.426
I have an entire
training program.


264
00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:50.033
There is an actual
curriculum with lots of tests.


265
00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:52.497
They have to actually
be able to go through beginner,


266
00:12:52.532 --> 00:12:54.499
intermediate,
advanced bondage.


267
00:12:54.534 --> 00:12:57.799
BDSM is bondage
and discipline, sadomasochism.


268
00:12:57.834 --> 00:13:00.043
Those two people,
they come to the table


269
00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:02.804
as sexual equals, they come to
the table with mutual consent.


270
00:13:02.839 --> 00:13:06.082
Then they have the opportunity
to explore a role


271
00:13:06.117 --> 00:13:09.382
that they may or may not live
in their day to day life,


272
00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:12.649
and that gives them a sense of
not only sexual satisfaction,


273
00:13:12.684 --> 00:13:15.091
but also release.

274
00:13:16.787 --> 00:13:21.064
I forget
sometimes that for someone


275
00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:22.725
walking in the door
for the first time,


276
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.068
this may be
the most terrifying thing


277
00:13:25.103 --> 00:13:27.235
that they've ever--
they've ever done, and,


278
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.831
you know, that I need to honor
that bravery a little bit.


279
00:13:29.866 --> 00:13:32.504
I don't think there are
actually any vanilla people.


280
00:13:32.539 --> 00:13:34.704
I think that there
are people who have not been


281
00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:38.609
introduced to the right
kind of kink for them yet.


282
00:13:38.644 --> 00:13:40.215
Count.

283
00:13:42.351 --> 00:13:43.713
Thank you.

284
00:13:47.818 --> 00:13:49.587
I started
my business in Columbus


285
00:13:49.622 --> 00:13:52.194
because that's where
my now ex-husband was.


286
00:13:53.263 --> 00:13:55.296
So my original
business partner is--


287
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:58.662
is Joseph,
who is also my ex-husband.


288
00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:04.503
Joseph was very adamant
with me that I couldn't be out.


289
00:14:05.138 --> 00:14:06.868
He had children,
they were my stepchildren,


290
00:14:06.903 --> 00:14:10.476
and that it would be
a threat to-- to them,


291
00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:12.280
it could be
a threat to, you know,


292
00:14:12.315 --> 00:14:14.216
the-- their custody
battle and it was a threat


293
00:14:14.251 --> 00:14:16.647
to how we were perceived,
you know, in the regular world.


294
00:14:16.682 --> 00:14:19.518
He was very obsessed with
how others would perceive us.


295
00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:22.719
I wanted to be outspoken.

296
00:14:22.754 --> 00:14:25.293
I wanted to be
proud of what I did,


297
00:14:25.328 --> 00:14:29.330
and I didn't want to feel
ashamed and have to hide it.


298
00:14:29.365 --> 00:14:31.662
And then after I--
I had separated from--


299
00:14:31.697 --> 00:14:35.600
from my ex-husband,
um, I thought,


300
00:14:35.635 --> 00:14:37.305
"Okay, well here's
my chance."


301
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.802
Alex is determined to come out

302
00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:41.507
and I think
the reasons are right.


303
00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:42.904
I think her heart
is in the right place


304
00:14:42.939 --> 00:14:44.708
and I feel like
it'll be a good move.


305
00:14:44.743 --> 00:14:46.545
But it doesn't mean
I'm not worried about her.


306
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.712
What if this is just
another tool that people use


307
00:14:48.747 --> 00:14:51.616
to exploit her
or to put her in danger?


308
00:14:52.352 --> 00:14:55.884
I think the public at large

309
00:14:55.919 --> 00:15:01.197
has a lot of misconceptions
about not just kink and BDSM,


310
00:15:01.232 --> 00:15:02.594
but sex workers.

311
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:04.761
And the more we can
talk candidly


312
00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:07.236
about what we do
and have real conversations


313
00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:10.173
about those things, the better
it's gonna be for everyone.


314
00:15:11.803 --> 00:15:14.573
Come on, stand up.

315
00:15:14.942 --> 00:15:16.608
-Come on, pussy.

316
00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:24.517
Oh, see
this little bitch, huh?


317
00:15:24.886 --> 00:15:28.851
So how I got started
was I was 17 years old


318
00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.326
just filling out
social media profiles


319
00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:34.230
and, uh, I would get
random guys messaging me.


320
00:15:34.265 --> 00:15:37.398
And one guy in particular
started to message me


321
00:15:37.433 --> 00:15:40.632
and he had
a fetish for getting peed on.


322
00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:42.667
That was his thing.

323
00:15:43.102 --> 00:15:44.867
And then,
so eventually he was like,


324
00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:46.374
"You know,
I really think that your piss


325
00:15:46.409 --> 00:15:48.211
should be bottled
and sold."


326
00:15:48.246 --> 00:15:50.708
And so I was like,
"Okay, then buy it," you know?


327
00:15:50.743 --> 00:15:53.381
And two weeks later
he sent me $250.


328
00:15:53.416 --> 00:15:54.976
I started doing
webcam and videos


329
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:58.683
and here I am today
as a cyber dominatrix.


330
00:15:58.718 --> 00:16:00.817
Now look at that camera
and say, "Thank you."


331
00:16:00.852 --> 00:16:03.259
-Thank you Princess.

332
00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:06.592
I met Ceara Lynch, uh,
through a chance meeting.


333
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:09.397
We, um, went
bowling together.


334
00:16:09.432 --> 00:16:13.632
She's telling me about how
she sells her dirty underwear


335
00:16:13.667 --> 00:16:16.932
to perverts online
and I was like, "What?


336
00:16:16.967 --> 00:16:19.308
This sounds amazing.
How can I get in on this?"


337
00:16:19.343 --> 00:16:21.739
I was kind of a starving
college student at the time


338
00:16:21.774 --> 00:16:25.281
and to be able to make money
off something you wear


339
00:16:25.316 --> 00:16:27.712
every single day,
that just was like,


340
00:16:27.747 --> 00:16:29.879
you know,
the American dream.


341
00:16:29.914 --> 00:16:32.519
We all just
started filming these


342
00:16:32.554 --> 00:16:35.324
very naive
fetish clips at the time.


343
00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:36.655
It was really funny.

344
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.558
You know,
we'd wear our sunglasses


345
00:16:38.593 --> 00:16:41.957
and be popping our bubble gum
and be like, you know,


346
00:16:41.992 --> 00:16:44.531
talking about loser
and stuff like that.


347
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:48.832
I filmed
every single day when I began,


348
00:16:48.867 --> 00:16:52.000
and I posted videos
every single day.


349
00:16:52.035 --> 00:16:55.311
And I've seen so many girls
get into this industry


350
00:16:55.346 --> 00:16:56.840
and they couldn't
cut it.


351
00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:58.479
They didn't
make the money


352
00:16:58.514 --> 00:17:01.317
because
they weren't hardworking.


353
00:17:07.083 --> 00:17:10.656
My name is Raevyn Rose
and I've always kind of been


354
00:17:10.691 --> 00:17:13.021
into porn and,
you know, watched--


355
00:17:13.056 --> 00:17:15.694
watched all sorts
of kinky porn and stuff.


356
00:17:15.729 --> 00:17:18.466
I grew up 50 minutes
south of Seattle.


357
00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:19.962
It was a small town.

358
00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:23.801
It's like
a white redneck country down,


359
00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:25.869
I don't know,
it was pretty trashy,


360
00:17:25.904 --> 00:17:27.805
AKA meth central, you know?

361
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.971
That's what they called it.

362
00:17:30.106 --> 00:17:31.479
Wow!

363
00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:34.614
I don't know.
It was okay.


364
00:17:34.649 --> 00:17:36.319
I'm glad I-- I'm glad
I don't have to work there.


365
00:17:36.354 --> 00:17:38.420
I'm glad I don't
have to work in essentially


366
00:17:38.455 --> 00:17:40.048
where I grew up
because I don't wanna


367
00:17:40.083 --> 00:17:42.556
have to see anybody
that I ever knew ever again.


368
00:17:42.991 --> 00:17:45.394
I was only
the odd one out, I guess,


369
00:17:45.429 --> 00:17:46.989
because I was religious.

370
00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:49.090
I was raised
Jehovah's Witness and that,


371
00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:50.993
you know, I didn't
get to do a lot.


372
00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:52.962
I never went
to any school dances.


373
00:17:52.997 --> 00:17:54.832
I didn't get to
do any sports.


374
00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:57.901
I didn't really get to
express myself a whole lot.


375
00:17:57.936 --> 00:17:59.936
I just wasn't allowed.

376
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:01.905
I-- I got caught sneaking out
once and they basically put me


377
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.544
on like kid probation,

378
00:18:03.579 --> 00:18:05.579
this thing called
'youths at risk'.


379
00:18:05.614 --> 00:18:07.075
And I just, like,
followed the rules


380
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.780
and did
what I had to do,


381
00:18:08.815 --> 00:18:10.749
and I was only on it
for like two months


382
00:18:10.784 --> 00:18:12.916
and then I got off of it

383
00:18:12.951 --> 00:18:15.490
and I kind of just
did the same thing again.


384
00:18:15.525 --> 00:18:17.393
I was just
smarter about it.


385
00:18:18.924 --> 00:18:23.498
I've been involved in the kink
scene for, I'd say two years.


386
00:18:23.533 --> 00:18:26.061
I was, um,
just going to play parties


387
00:18:26.096 --> 00:18:28.800
and I didn't think
I'd have any, you know,


388
00:18:28.835 --> 00:18:31.539
I guess professional
involvement or,


389
00:18:31.574 --> 00:18:34.443
you know, turn it into
something I'd make money from.


390
00:18:36.106 --> 00:18:40.449
When I first met Astro it was
at a play party and she was--


391
00:18:40.484 --> 00:18:44.046
she was in all leather and
she had a slave with her and,


392
00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:46.884
you know, she was just
telling him to do stuff.


393
00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:48.688
She used him
as a footrest


394
00:18:48.723 --> 00:18:51.955
and she was just,
like, really powerful.


395
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.057
And this was, you know,
my first time seeing her


396
00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:56.927
and I was like,
"I should go talk to her.


397
00:18:56.962 --> 00:18:58.632
I should see
how she does this."


398
00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:01.569
I saw that she's, like,
this really keen, young,


399
00:19:01.604 --> 00:19:05.441
energetic,
warm-hearted, um, woman.


400
00:19:05.476 --> 00:19:07.806
She's a little,
I'd say like, not lost,


401
00:19:07.841 --> 00:19:12.415
but adventurous and wants to
learn a lot about the industry.


402
00:19:13.583 --> 00:19:15.616
Astro asked me
to do a video,


403
00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:18.850
just a-- a simple
fetish video, which was fun.


404
00:19:18.885 --> 00:19:21.952
My first time in front
of a camera it was a foot video


405
00:19:21.987 --> 00:19:24.394
and yeah, that was--
that was pretty much my start.


406
00:19:30.193 --> 00:19:31.896
Hey. How's it going?

407
00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:35.471
I got into bikini coffee
about a year and a half ago.


408
00:19:35.506 --> 00:19:37.704
One of my vanilla friends
had been doing it a while


409
00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:39.937
and she said it's the best
money she's ever made.


410
00:19:39.972 --> 00:19:41.741
Um, let's see.

411
00:19:41.776 --> 00:19:44.810
I have hot coffee,
iced coffee, energy drinks,


412
00:19:44.845 --> 00:19:46.515
we have Monster
and Red Bull


413
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.517
and I can make
anything blended.


414
00:19:48.552 --> 00:19:50.519
Uh, tea, smoothies.

415
00:19:50.554 --> 00:19:53.984
I've had customers
tip me $50 to $150,


416
00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:55.722
um

417
00:19:55.757 --> 00:19:57.724
for just looking nice.

418
00:19:57.759 --> 00:20:01.090
And then I had one come through
because he follows my Snapchat.


419
00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:02.894
He's like,
"Well, I watch your--


420
00:20:02.929 --> 00:20:04.896
your Snapchat all the time
and it's really good


421
00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:07.096
and I feel like I should be
giving you more money for it."


422
00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:08.834
I see him maybe
once a month


423
00:20:08.869 --> 00:20:10.704
and he'll tip me, like,
about a hundred bucks.


424
00:20:10.739 --> 00:20:12.673
This area's pretty good.
It's pretty innocent.


425
00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:15.775
They don't-- I rarely get
shows or asked for shows here.


426
00:20:16.344 --> 00:20:18.679
In my couple years
of doing this,


427
00:20:18.714 --> 00:20:21.781
I haven't had any really,
really scary, uh, instances.


428
00:20:21.816 --> 00:20:26.049
But about two weeks ago
I did and I--


429
00:20:26.084 --> 00:20:28.084
I just-- I was working,
doing my thing.


430
00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:30.086
I had this guy come
through and gave me a $10 tip,


431
00:20:30.121 --> 00:20:33.595
which is nice, and then,
um, you know, I was done


432
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.499
and-- and then he's like,
"Here's a $20 for a show."


433
00:20:36.534 --> 00:20:37.995
I was like,
"I don't do shows."


434
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.129
He's like, "Yes you do.
All the other girls do."


435
00:20:40.164 --> 00:20:43.605
I'm like, "I'm sorry, I don't.
Not my style."


436
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.068
And he's like,
"You have to do a show."


437
00:20:45.103 --> 00:20:46.938
And I'm like,
"I'm not doing a show."


438
00:20:46.973 --> 00:20:49.138
And I walk away and I'm like,
"You have to leave now."


439
00:20:49.173 --> 00:20:51.107
I'm just cleaning up
and doing my thing


440
00:20:51.142 --> 00:20:53.945
and then I walk back over to
talk to him and his dick's out.


441
00:20:54.314 --> 00:20:56.585
And I was just like,
"That's disgusting.


442
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.719
You have to leave,
you have five seconds to leave


443
00:20:58.754 --> 00:21:00.523
or I'm gonna throw
hot water on you."


444
00:21:00.558 --> 00:21:02.723
And he's like-- and then
he's just going off on me


445
00:21:02.758 --> 00:21:04.659
and calling me names
and just flipping out.


446
00:21:04.694 --> 00:21:06.661
So I'm, like,
pouring this hot water


447
00:21:06.696 --> 00:21:08.564
and I was like,
"I'm gonna count down now."


448
00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:10.698
And I'm--
I'm counting down slowly


449
00:21:10.733 --> 00:21:14.097
and he's just calling me a cunt
and a bitch, just going off.


450
00:21:14.132 --> 00:21:15.901
So I get closer and closer
and he starts moving.


451
00:21:15.936 --> 00:21:17.232
He's like,
"If you throw water on me


452
00:21:17.267 --> 00:21:18.640
I will fucking shoot you."

453
00:21:18.675 --> 00:21:19.773
I'm like
,


454
00:21:19.808 --> 00:21:21.137
"Okay."

455
00:21:21.172 --> 00:21:22.842
So I didn't think
anything of it


456
00:21:22.877 --> 00:21:25.647
until he came back,
like, within two minutes


457
00:21:25.682 --> 00:21:27.649
and-- and parked his car

458
00:21:27.684 --> 00:21:29.849
and starts banging
on my windows and my door.


459
00:21:29.884 --> 00:21:33.754
And, uh, I had a customer
in front of his car


460
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:35.822
and I was like, "Can you wait
here while I call the cops


461
00:21:35.857 --> 00:21:38.660
'cause I don't know
if he has a weapon,


462
00:21:38.695 --> 00:21:41.993
and whether or not he does,
he's banging on my windows."


463
00:21:42.028 --> 00:21:45.194
So I called the cops,
filed a report.


464
00:21:45.229 --> 00:21:47.603
He came back one more time,
kept doing the thing


465
00:21:47.638 --> 00:21:49.605
and-- and like kicking
rocks at the building.


466
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.939
And like, I mean,
after arguing that much,


467
00:21:53.974 --> 00:21:56.612
like even before
he got out of his car,


468
00:21:56.647 --> 00:21:58.141
like, why would I
wanna flash somebody


469
00:21:58.176 --> 00:22:00.044
that's fucking
yelling at me?


470
00:22:01.212 --> 00:22:04.213
This hot, sexy coffee
is nine dollars.


471
00:22:05.821 --> 00:22:08.349
It was fun dressing up
all the time at first,


472
00:22:08.384 --> 00:22:11.858
but now that
I have to, like,


473
00:22:11.893 --> 00:22:14.091
some days
I don't feel like being naked.


474
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.765
Like, some days I don't
feel like being stared at


475
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.932
and with the job I'm entering
now I get to choose


476
00:22:19.967 --> 00:22:21.835
when I get to do that,
I get to choose


477
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.232
when I'm getting
the attention


478
00:22:23.267 --> 00:22:25.003
or when I wanna address
the attention.


479
00:22:25.038 --> 00:22:26.840
You know, I've only--
I've only been camming


480
00:22:26.875 --> 00:22:31.339
for a few months,
maybe-- maybe five-ish times.


481
00:22:31.374 --> 00:22:35.882
It's been fun. I talk and--
and I even had locals on there.


482
00:22:35.917 --> 00:22:38.148
They'll watch me and then
they'll come visit me at work.


483
00:22:38.183 --> 00:22:39.655
The next thing
they're like, "Wow!


484
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.019
Your cam show
is awesome."


485
00:22:41.054 --> 00:22:42.955
So that always
feels good.


486
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.660
I have 11 people
on here right now


487
00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:46.255
and six of 'em are guests,
so that means


488
00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.059
they don't have accounts.

489
00:22:48.094 --> 00:22:50.028
Tipping is always
an option


490
00:22:50.063 --> 00:22:52.866
and private rooms are,
you know,


491
00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:54.362
paid for
by second or minute.


492
00:22:54.397 --> 00:22:57.002
Being that I'm working
a day job already,


493
00:22:57.037 --> 00:22:59.807
that kind of
takes away from, um,


494
00:22:59.842 --> 00:23:04.042
camming and making my own
videos because I'm on call.


495
00:23:04.077 --> 00:23:07.309
My schedule is all over
the place, but everything--


496
00:23:07.344 --> 00:23:10.411
all of my work,
all of my income is,


497
00:23:10.446 --> 00:23:12.721
um, sex work related.

498
00:23:12.756 --> 00:23:16.417
So I can-- I can
advertise myself in many ways


499
00:23:16.452 --> 00:23:19.926
through, you know, each of
these work outlets, I guess.


500
00:23:21.897 --> 00:23:23.094
So that was a tip.

501
00:23:23.129 --> 00:23:24.997
Yeah, it was

502
00:23:25.032 --> 00:23:26.328
"Just found you.

503
00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:28.396
Would love to be
added as a friend.


504
00:23:28.431 --> 00:23:31.740
Hello from East Coast USA.
Kiss, kiss."


505
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.436
When I started
doing this it was just me


506
00:23:35.471 --> 00:23:37.977
and my webcam,
me and my camera.


507
00:23:38.012 --> 00:23:42.916
I would get guys
who had fetish requests.


508
00:23:42.951 --> 00:23:44.720
You're my little
cum eater.


509
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:48.086
You're my little bitch.
Suck it!


510
00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:51.892
The fee and be bossy to me
and-- and be mean to me


511
00:23:51.927 --> 00:23:53.388
and I thought,
"Oh, this is kind of funny."


512
00:23:53.423 --> 00:23:55.093
I wanted to
be a bitch.


513
00:23:55.128 --> 00:23:56.361
Like, that's how
I'm in real life, you know?


514
00:23:56.396 --> 00:23:58.800
Do you want me to take control
of that little mind of yours?


515
00:23:59.462 --> 00:24:00.967
Mm-hmm.

516
00:24:01.002 --> 00:24:04.102
Do you need me
to make


517
00:24:04.137 --> 00:24:07.006
all of your decisions?

518
00:24:07.508 --> 00:24:09.305
I knew that I was
making money 'cause I was--


519
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.406
I was sexualized,

520
00:24:11.441 --> 00:24:14.409
but I didn't feel like
I was doing anything sexual.


521
00:24:14.844 --> 00:24:17.478
So in the beginning
I didn't-- I didn't care.


522
00:24:17.513 --> 00:24:19.414
I just wanted the money.

523
00:24:19.449 --> 00:24:21.053
Honestly.

524
00:24:21.088 --> 00:24:22.989
I love the internet
in a lot of ways


525
00:24:23.024 --> 00:24:27.224
when it comes to folks
that have sexual preferences


526
00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:31.360
and proclivities
that are outside of average,


527
00:24:31.395 --> 00:24:35.034
because for so long they
haven't necessarily been able


528
00:24:35.069 --> 00:24:36.497
to connect
with other people


529
00:24:36.532 --> 00:24:38.433
that have preferences
like theirs.


530
00:24:38.468 --> 00:24:43.713
♪

531
00:24:45.915 --> 00:24:48.212
Well, I've been a pervert

532

since I was
five years old.


533
00:24:49.985 --> 00:24:52.051
It's been, yeah,
pretty much a lifelong thing.


534
00:24:52.086 --> 00:24:54.757
Uh, the femdom, um, thing--
part of, I think,


535
00:24:54.792 --> 00:24:58.090
I didn't come into it
until about I was 13 or 14


536
00:24:58.125 --> 00:25:00.356
and then I discovered
my first dirty magazine,


537
00:25:00.391 --> 00:25:01.830
femdom magazine.

538
00:25:03.834 --> 00:25:05.801
In the early days it was--
it was a little more difficult


539
00:25:05.836 --> 00:25:09.530
because obviously back then we
only had like 14.4- bit modems.


540
00:25:09.565 --> 00:25:11.906
There was no
HD 4K video.


541
00:25:11.941 --> 00:25:14.810
You know, this is,
like, all on usenet groups


542
00:25:14.845 --> 00:25:18.781
and bulletin boards
and ASCII text porn.


543

<i>Ten point bonus.</i>

544
00:25:22.314 --> 00:25:24.820
You had to pay for the,
like, the membership sites


545
00:25:24.855 --> 00:25:26.349
to get like videos
because it was


546
00:25:26.384 --> 00:25:28.219
really expensive
back then, of course.


547
00:25:28.254 --> 00:25:30.991
And when the internet
speeds caught up, uh,


548
00:25:31.026 --> 00:25:34.830
then of course people were able
to make their own videos


549
00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:37.360
and sell them online
and you could see it instantly.


550

I'm not gonna
fuck you right now.

00:25:47.273 --> 00:25:50.241
I want things
to be a little spicier.


553
00:25:50.276 --> 00:25:52.111
Like I said,
I've been planning.


554
00:25:52.146 --> 00:25:54.014
Hey. All right.

555
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:55.510
So I was an exotic dancer
and someone came up to me


556
00:25:55.545 --> 00:25:58.480
in a club
and was kind of a--


557
00:25:58.515 --> 00:26:01.186
a mild mannered guy
with glasses.


558
00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:03.089
And he is like,
"So how do you feel


559
00:26:03.124 --> 00:26:05.256
about like being mean to guys,
like yelling at them?


560
00:26:05.291 --> 00:26:06.961
You know,
like being a bitch?"


561
00:26:06.996 --> 00:26:09.227
I was like, "Why is this
so hard to explain?


562
00:26:09.262 --> 00:26:10.591
Like, yes.
Yes, I'm into that."


563
00:26:10.626 --> 00:26:13.330
He'd pay us,
like, a lot at the time


564
00:26:13.365 --> 00:26:15.464
just for a whole day
of like, "All right,


565
00:26:15.499 --> 00:26:18.874
get in
your brattiest outfit, um,


566
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:20.601
and imagine
you're a sorority princess."


567
00:26:20.636 --> 00:26:23.175
We found out
where he was putting the videos


568
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.210
and we were like, "Is he just
jerking off to this?


569
00:26:25.245 --> 00:26:26.948
It seems bigger than that."

570
00:26:26.983 --> 00:26:28.510
So we found it
and we found clips for sale


571
00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:30.380
and we were like,

572
00:26:30.415 --> 00:26:32.184
"Shit, we can do
this ourselves!"


573
00:26:34.089 --> 00:26:38.025
I think, yeah, clips
and indulging in your fetishes


574
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.127
instead of like looking
for instance, uh,


575
00:26:41.162 --> 00:26:43.327
through a whole DVD
of regular porn


576
00:26:43.362 --> 00:26:45.065
just to see a foot.

577
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.462
You're able to find
exactly what you need.


578
00:26:46.497 --> 00:26:48.398
Our world is busy.

579
00:26:48.433 --> 00:26:50.939
You've got ten minutes on
the subway real quick, I guess.


580
00:26:50.974 --> 00:26:55.273
But like, um, don't jerk off
on the subway though, please.


581
00:26:55.308 --> 00:26:59.915
There is like a driving
change in the porn community


582
00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:05.052
and fetish porn allows
people to access some desires


583
00:27:05.087 --> 00:27:07.615
that they might not be able
to access in real life,


584
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.289
to fantasize about stuff
that they thought was too evil


585
00:27:11.324 --> 00:27:13.357
or sick or weird
to fantasize about.


586
00:27:13.392 --> 00:27:15.227
And I feel like there's
a lot of self-acceptance


587
00:27:15.262 --> 00:27:18.494
that comes with,
like, accepting one's fetish.


588
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:21.002
There's always been perverts,
there's always been,


589
00:27:21.037 --> 00:27:23.037
you know, these kind of
groups and the internet


590
00:27:23.072 --> 00:27:25.138
obviously helps
people find each other.


591
00:27:25.173 --> 00:27:27.943
A lot of people will associate
this with like sort of dark--


592
00:27:27.978 --> 00:27:29.945
undercurrent,
dark web sort of thing.


593
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.212
And it's not, it's just regular
people who for obvious reasons


594
00:27:33.247 --> 00:27:36.952
don't want to go public
with their deepest fantasies.


595
00:27:36.987 --> 00:27:39.251
We have a lot of cam girls
coming into the industry.


596
00:27:39.286 --> 00:27:41.484
We have a lot of porn stars,
um, coming into the site


597
00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:43.486
now that are shooting
content for themselves


598
00:27:43.521 --> 00:27:45.290
rather than for
a production company,


599
00:27:45.325 --> 00:27:47.160
um, where they never
get royalties,


600
00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:49.096
where they never make money
after that one shoot.


601
00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:51.934
They think it up from
start to finish, they shoot it,


602
00:27:51.969 --> 00:27:53.936
they angle it,
they make it how they want,


603
00:27:53.971 --> 00:27:56.433
and you're getting a connection
with the artist and, you know,


604
00:27:56.468 --> 00:27:58.501
I think that really
goes far with the consumer.


605
00:27:58.536 --> 00:28:00.668
I remember the first thing
I watched was,


606
00:28:00.703 --> 00:28:05.607
like, the very stereotypical
like, uh, someone fucked my,


607
00:28:05.642 --> 00:28:09.281
like, stepsister and like,
she's like extremely, like,


608
00:28:09.316 --> 00:28:13.021
dolled up and like--
like, very effeminate voice,


609
00:28:13.056 --> 00:28:14.682
"Eh," type of thing.

610
00:28:14.717 --> 00:28:18.026
And from there
it got really dull,


611
00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:20.490
I guess, like,
very quickly for me.


612
00:28:20.525 --> 00:28:22.426
At first I didn't, like,
understand that there was


613
00:28:22.461 --> 00:28:25.099
this like whole
underground sort of-- like,


614
00:28:25.134 --> 00:28:29.301
I would even say, like,
punk scene of, uh, porn


615
00:28:29.336 --> 00:28:32.436
where like it's self-produced,
self-published,


616
00:28:32.471 --> 00:28:34.372
uh, self-promoted.

617
00:28:34.407 --> 00:28:36.671
And I guess that's what--
that's what keeps me coming.


618
00:28:36.706 --> 00:28:39.344
Uh, no pun intended.

619
00:28:39.379 --> 00:28:42.512
I do a lot of research
in how our clips are selling.


620
00:28:42.547 --> 00:28:44.580
Um, I do-- like,
I run the analytics


621
00:28:44.615 --> 00:28:47.286
on what categories,
uh, what clip titles.


622
00:28:47.321 --> 00:28:50.355
Um, video lengths, like,
the difference between


623
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.027
doing a full length video

624
00:28:52.062 --> 00:28:53.754
and then doing
part one and part two.


625
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:55.525
And, like, we-- like,
there's a full, like,


626
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.726
analytics system that
happens that determines


627
00:28:58.761 --> 00:29:00.970
what our schedule is going to
look like for the next month.


628
00:29:05.471 --> 00:29:08.307
So we're gonna do
some stuff around, like,


629
00:29:08.342 --> 00:29:10.309
kind of just be worshipping

630
00:29:10.344 --> 00:29:11.640
my-- my legs
and we're kissing


631
00:29:11.675 --> 00:29:13.444
and doing kind of
stuff like that.


632
00:29:13.479 --> 00:29:16.216
And then we're gonna do,
um, the face sitting part.


633
00:29:16.251 --> 00:29:18.119
When we do the face sitting,
I'm gonna have her


634
00:29:18.154 --> 00:29:19.615
flip around
so her head is here.


635
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.551
-Okay.
-And for--


636
00:29:21.586 --> 00:29:24.092
I want to get some
very specific shots


637
00:29:24.127 --> 00:29:28.327
of like here with--
of like looking up my ass.


638
00:29:28.362 --> 00:29:30.362
You're gonna wanna try to
get an angle from underneath.


639
00:29:30.397 --> 00:29:32.397
If you're doing it, like,
right where you are standing--


640
00:29:32.432 --> 00:29:34.234
Okay, like go down.
Go down further.


641
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:36.203
See-- see that's
much better?


642
00:29:36.238 --> 00:29:37.534
Do not stay in the same place.

643
00:29:37.569 --> 00:29:39.305
-Okay.
-Okay.


644
00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.735
Um, ready? And....

645
00:29:45.775 --> 00:29:47.412
Oh, this looks nice.

646
00:29:47.447 --> 00:29:49.348
-They are very cute.

647
00:29:49.383 --> 00:29:50.646
That's so cute.

648
00:29:51.248 --> 00:29:53.220
Oh, I know.

649
00:29:53.255 --> 00:29:55.288
It's like a
reinforced toe here.


650
00:29:55.323 --> 00:29:59.226
Fetishes
are defined as any sort of,


651
00:29:59.261 --> 00:30:03.824
um, sexual attraction
to a non-human object


652
00:30:03.859 --> 00:30:07.498
or a body part specific, so not
the totality of a human being.


653
00:30:07.533 --> 00:30:10.732
We don't really know
what causes fetishes.


654
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:15.638
You know, we have all sorts
of anecdotal stories as to why.


655
00:30:15.673 --> 00:30:18.179
We know that when
you look at, um,


656
00:30:18.214 --> 00:30:21.776
FMRI studies and you look at
the brain that the turn on


657
00:30:21.811 --> 00:30:24.350
that they get from--
and the dopamine burst


658
00:30:24.385 --> 00:30:29.289
that they get from seeing
their fetish object is the same


659
00:30:29.324 --> 00:30:32.292
as the dopamine burst
that someone gets when seeing


660
00:30:32.327 --> 00:30:34.195
their romantic partner
that they're attracted to.


661
00:30:35.297 --> 00:30:37.495
I'm a lifelong foot guy.

662
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.233
And women's feet
in particularly, obviously,


663
00:30:39.268 --> 00:30:40.729
that men's feet
are kind of gross


664
00:30:40.764 --> 00:30:42.401
to me.

665
00:30:42.436 --> 00:30:45.206
But, uh, I think
they're just amazing and--


666
00:30:45.241 --> 00:30:47.637
and pretty and they're really
underrated part of the body.


667
00:30:47.672 --> 00:30:50.343
They're very sensual
and there's been a lot of


668
00:30:50.378 --> 00:30:52.576
just, like,
scientific research, you know,


669
00:30:52.611 --> 00:30:54.644
in it where the feet
and the genitals


670
00:30:54.679 --> 00:30:56.349
and the brain
are very close to each other.


671
00:30:56.384 --> 00:30:58.582
There's like
possible connections there.


672
00:31:00.157 --> 00:31:02.322
There's different
experiences you have


673
00:31:02.357 --> 00:31:04.456
that inform your fetishes
and things like that.


674
00:31:04.491 --> 00:31:06.260
And I have often thought
about those things


675
00:31:06.295 --> 00:31:07.855
and actually thought about
a lot of the things


676
00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.660
that have happened
in my life that I definitely


677
00:31:10.695 --> 00:31:13.366
probably gave someone a kink
or gave someone a fetish.


678
00:31:13.401 --> 00:31:14.829
You know what?
I'm not, sorry.


679
00:31:14.864 --> 00:31:16.600
Not-- not sorry.

680
00:31:16.635 --> 00:31:20.241
This online world
of fetishes has exploded.


681
00:31:20.276 --> 00:31:23.541
I think probably
before the last decade


682
00:31:23.576 --> 00:31:26.280
somebody with a fetish
really wanted to be closeted.


683
00:31:26.315 --> 00:31:28.810
It was taboo,
it was weird.


684
00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:32.319
Now, um,
it's just all over.


685
00:31:32.354 --> 00:31:34.486
It's so popular.
It's kind of amazing.


686
00:31:34.521 --> 00:31:36.422
You start getting
these communities


687
00:31:36.457 --> 00:31:39.491
of people online that are
into all kinds of crazy things.


688
00:31:39.526 --> 00:31:41.790
You know, clown fetish
and fart fetish


689
00:31:41.825 --> 00:31:44.463
and wedgie fetish
and balloon popping.


690
00:31:44.898 --> 00:31:46.696
Um, certainly
without the internet


691
00:31:46.731 --> 00:31:49.468
I don't think
that would be the case.


692
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:51.833
Perfect.

693
00:31:59.744 --> 00:32:03.548
So I'd like for you
to tell me a little bit about


694
00:32:03.583 --> 00:32:06.683
where you think you wanna take
the Raevyn Rose brand


695
00:32:06.718 --> 00:32:09.653
or like what-- how you
would describe, you know,


696
00:32:09.688 --> 00:32:11.259
the-- that persona?

697
00:32:11.294 --> 00:32:13.195
Yeah, I really am
curious and open


698
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:14.658
to trying
all these new things.


699
00:32:14.693 --> 00:32:16.462
It's-- it's truly
a new life for me.


700
00:32:16.497 --> 00:32:18.629
All right. So cu-- curious
is a good keyword.


701
00:32:18.664 --> 00:32:20.301
-So we're-we're gonna--
-I met Alexandra


702
00:32:20.336 --> 00:32:22.633
through a mutual friend's
birthday party.


703
00:32:22.668 --> 00:32:24.668
The way I was coming
into the industry,


704
00:32:24.703 --> 00:32:26.241
I was taking it
very slow.


705
00:32:26.276 --> 00:32:28.309
I was only,
you know, doing camming


706
00:32:28.344 --> 00:32:29.871
and considering doing videos.

707
00:32:29.906 --> 00:32:32.247
Which fetishes
really speak to you right now


708
00:32:32.282 --> 00:32:35.217
that you could--
you could kind of see yourself


709
00:32:35.252 --> 00:32:37.747
marketing like more than--
than other things?


710
00:32:37.782 --> 00:32:39.683
-Humiliation would be one--
-Okay.


711
00:32:39.718 --> 00:32:42.356
--just 'cause it's--
it's very exciting.


712
00:32:42.391 --> 00:32:44.589
Or public stuff,
I really like public stuff,


713
00:32:44.624 --> 00:32:46.393
-figuring it out.
-That's a really good one.


714
00:32:46.428 --> 00:32:48.395
You know, Astro had
told me, "This-this chic's


715
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:49.825
really rad and you're
really gonna like her."


716
00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.497
And-- and I was like,
"Okay. Okay."


717
00:32:51.532 --> 00:32:53.301
So I messaged her
and I was like,


718
00:32:53.336 --> 00:32:55.633
"Hey, you wanna do
some weird stuff in Vegas?"


719
00:32:55.668 --> 00:32:59.307
And she's like, "Uh...
yeah, let's get weird."


720
00:32:59.342 --> 00:33:02.343
I am queen
of Khanum...


721
00:33:03.775 --> 00:33:06.380
I've come from a planet,
that's very far from you.


722
00:33:06.815 --> 00:33:10.978
But unfortunately
I have been unable to find


723
00:33:11.013 --> 00:33:12.881
a suitable host

724
00:33:12.916 --> 00:33:16.588
for the perpetuation
of my race.


725
00:33:16.623 --> 00:33:19.690
I did set up
the filming that day,


726
00:33:19.725 --> 00:33:22.891
um, for her to be essentially
submissive in the first half,


727
00:33:22.926 --> 00:33:24.827
and then I brought in
a film slave and had her be


728
00:33:24.862 --> 00:33:26.796
dominant to him
in the second half.


729
00:33:26.831 --> 00:33:29.029
I watched her go from one
to the other pretty seamlessly


730
00:33:29.064 --> 00:33:32.868
and work with me in both roles
and was like, you know,


731
00:33:32.903 --> 00:33:35.409
excited to learn sounds
and excited to learn bondages.


732
00:33:35.444 --> 00:33:36.610
And she was like,
"Cool, we're gonna dump


733
00:33:36.645 --> 00:33:38.841
this guy's cum in his mouth?
All right, let's go for it."


734
00:33:38.876 --> 00:33:42.009
That's so, so rare
to find someone to--


735
00:33:42.044 --> 00:33:43.747
to really be like that.

736
00:33:43.782 --> 00:33:45.584
No matter what kind
of video you're doing,


737
00:33:45.619 --> 00:33:47.014
even if you're doing
a foot fetish video,


738
00:33:47.049 --> 00:33:48.587
an ass worship video,

739
00:33:48.622 --> 00:33:50.457
like a masturbation
on anything,


740
00:33:50.492 --> 00:33:53.394
put your face in as much
of the shot as you can


741
00:33:53.429 --> 00:33:56.331
because that's actually
what's selling your videos.


742
00:33:56.366 --> 00:33:58.927
I have turned away
probably the last 200 people


743
00:33:58.962 --> 00:34:00.863
that have come to me
and asked me to train them.


744
00:34:01.465 --> 00:34:03.503
I definitely
had some individuals


745
00:34:03.538 --> 00:34:07.408
for whom they were not
as morally and ethically sound.


746
00:34:07.443 --> 00:34:10.576
I feel like at this point
I've become a much better judge


747
00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:13.843
of character and I no longer,
"I'm interested


748
00:34:13.878 --> 00:34:16.582
in teaching someone
who's only motivated by money."


749
00:34:16.617 --> 00:34:18.749
Okay, so,
when you're setting up,


750
00:34:18.784 --> 00:34:20.553
you're gonna
set your lights up--


751
00:34:20.588 --> 00:34:22.918
There's a big difference
between selling a persona


752
00:34:22.953 --> 00:34:24.590
and selling yourself.

753
00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:26.053
People will always
try to pay you for more


754
00:34:26.088 --> 00:34:27.626
than you want to do.

755
00:34:27.661 --> 00:34:30.827
The best way
to combat it is to not--


756
00:34:30.862 --> 00:34:33.665
to not be offended, to not

758
00:34:35.867 --> 00:34:37.603

"Nope, that's not
something I offer," right?


760
00:34:39.607 --> 00:34:43.510
But there may come times where
someone badgers you enough


761
00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:45.644
or offers you
a lot of money


762
00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.382
and you're on
the fence about it.

oily,
uncomfortable, you know,

I'm getting goosebumps

Don't-- don't do it,
because it's never worth it.


773
00:35:11.474 --> 00:35:13.672
Because afterwards
you feel like you gave

There's a certain
quality that you need


777
00:35:22.881 --> 00:35:26.388
as a sex worker
to kind of believe


778
00:35:26.423 --> 00:35:29.523
that what you're doing
is inherently good.


779
00:35:29.558 --> 00:35:31.459
We live in a society
that people still tell you


780
00:35:31.494 --> 00:35:33.021
that being
a sex worker is--


781
00:35:33.056 --> 00:35:34.990
is like dirty or gross
or it's immoral, or--

or that, you know,
"You should be ashamed of it."

outta your head, right?

785
00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:44.098
But if you inherently believe
that the thing


786
00:35:44.133 --> 00:35:46.001
that you're doing is positive,
it does good for other people,


787
00:35:46.036 --> 00:35:48.036
it does good for you,
like being able to express it


788
00:35:48.071 --> 00:35:49.741
and participate in it
and all those things


789

real intrinsic value,

then it's just very,
very nourishing.


791
00:35:57.817 --> 00:36:00.950
I've been taking
these big steps and it's all,

If you can't release

"Oh, this sounds stupid,"

There's nothing going on here.

00:38:12.853 --> 00:38:14.655
You want a better look?

845
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:15.920
You're gonna
start making a lot of money.


846
00:38:15.955 --> 00:38:17.152
The money feels
really good.


847
00:38:18.054 --> 00:38:20.287
But once you get to
the point that you're being


848
00:38:20.322 --> 00:38:22.289
able to cover all
of your own expenses,


849
00:38:22.324 --> 00:38:26.260
try to keep your cost
of living at 50%


850
00:38:26.295 --> 00:38:28.097
or less of
what you're making.


851
00:38:28.499 --> 00:38:32.706
Because no matter
how much money you make,


852
00:38:32.741 --> 00:38:35.709
this is-- you-- you cannot
do this forever, right?


853
00:38:35.744 --> 00:38:39.141
Aw, you're so--
you're so weak and sensitive.


854
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:43.244
Good enough.
Good enough, I guess.


855
00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:47.248
You know, I think I'm
gonna get myself some toys


856
00:38:47.283 --> 00:38:49.987
and, uh, and please
myself a little more.


857
00:38:50.422 --> 00:38:53.254
You can clean up.
Good job.


858
00:38:54.895 --> 00:38:56.763
-Okay.
-Cut it.


859
00:38:58.393 --> 00:38:59.898
So next time you do

860
00:38:59.933 --> 00:39:01.262
more small penis
stimulation stuff,


861
00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:03.638
talk more about
the size of the dick


862
00:39:03.673 --> 00:39:05.365
-and how the dick doesn't--
-Yeah.


863
00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.774
Um, especially 'cause you do
solo masturbation stuff--


864
00:39:07.809 --> 00:39:10.271
not many people combine
small penis stimulation


865
00:39:10.306 --> 00:39:12.174
with like,
nudity and masturbation.


866
00:39:12.209 --> 00:39:13.912
So maybe
you're gonna be like,


867
00:39:13.947 --> 00:39:15.683
"This is the kind of

Your cock
doesn't please me.

00:39:17.346 --> 00:39:19.049
Well, I guess you can watch
what it would look like.


870
00:39:19.084 --> 00:39:20.886
Ha, ha.",
you know, and then--


871
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:22.624
and go from there, it's
really-- it's a good angle.


872
00:39:22.659 --> 00:39:24.087
-Okay, cool.
-I'd definitely do that.


873
00:39:24.122 --> 00:39:26.122
-Good job.
-Yeah. Thanks.


874

She comes from
a generation that has--


875
00:39:29.292 --> 00:39:32.260
has the least amount
of stigma attached to sex work


876

She's not having
to unpack the baggage.


878

My mom
first thought I was a stripper


879
00:39:46.683 --> 00:39:48.144
and I was like,
"Mom, I can't dance.


880
00:39:48.179 --> 00:39:50.377
Like, there's no
fucking way I'm a stripper."


881
00:39:50.412 --> 00:39:52.654
And then-- and then
she thought I was escorting


882
00:39:52.689 --> 00:39:55.382
and I was just like,
"Maybe if I'm completely honest


883
00:39:55.417 --> 00:39:58.319
with her,
she'll feel like I'm safe."


884
00:39:58.992 --> 00:40:00.288
Feet...

885
00:40:01.258 --> 00:40:02.763
ass.

886
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:07.097
Mm-mm, what really

887
00:40:07.132 --> 00:40:09.902
fucks you up
the most?


888
00:40:09.937 --> 00:40:13.268
She thinks if I'm nude,
it's the worst thing ever.


889
00:40:13.303 --> 00:40:15.237
So I try to
explain to her like,


890
00:40:15.272 --> 00:40:18.746
"Guys are still jerking off,
but I'm clothed


891
00:40:18.781 --> 00:40:21.342
and I'm at home
and I'm safe and I'm happy."


892
00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:22.948
And I try to
give her detail


893
00:40:22.983 --> 00:40:24.114
and she just
doesn't wanna hear it,


894
00:40:24.149 --> 00:40:25.445
but she's okay with it.

895
00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.953
My brother
and my dad know and, um,


896
00:40:27.988 --> 00:40:29.922
I had to wine
and dine him first.


897
00:40:29.957 --> 00:40:32.386
I kind of I had to,
you know, make sure


898
00:40:32.421 --> 00:40:35.862
that they're
drunk for the, uh, reveal.


899
00:40:35.897 --> 00:40:37.897
And, um, my brother
had already known


900
00:40:37.932 --> 00:40:40.834
for three years, he was just,
like, keeping it a secret.


901
00:40:40.869 --> 00:40:43.397
He gave me this burst
of laughter and then just,


902
00:40:43.432 --> 00:40:44.970
you know,
"I-- I've already known and--


903
00:40:45.005 --> 00:40:46.840
and I'm cool with it."

904
00:40:46.875 --> 00:40:50.470
My dad held my hand,
gave me a stern, serious look


905
00:40:50.505 --> 00:40:53.011
and he said,
"It doesn't matter what


906
00:40:53.046 --> 00:40:55.211
your occupation is,
you're still my daughter."


907
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.785
So some of my family knows

908
00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.413
and most of
my friends know.


909
00:40:59.448 --> 00:41:01.888
Uh, like some of the older
members of my family,


910
00:41:01.923 --> 00:41:04.121
I'm waiting
specifically until


911
00:41:04.156 --> 00:41:06.992
I'm in a pretty good financial
position to tell them.


912
00:41:07.027 --> 00:41:10.831
I feel like people judge you
less about what you do


913
00:41:10.866 --> 00:41:12.965
in this industry if you're
making enough money to,


914
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.935
like, do well for yourself
and to do well for your family.


915
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:20.104
I feel like once
I'm pretty solid and like,


916
00:41:20.139 --> 00:41:21.974
"Oh, I've been
here for three years.


917
00:41:22.009 --> 00:41:24.009
Oh, by the way I've been
editing porn this entire time.


918
00:41:24.044 --> 00:41:26.308
Don't be mad at me."

919
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.508
I-
- I had a thing that

920
00:41:28.543 --> 00:41:30.444
I could tell people
in the vanilla world.


921
00:41:30.479 --> 00:41:32.281
When people
asked me what I did,


922
00:41:32.316 --> 00:41:34.250
I could say,
"I breed cats,"


923
00:41:34.285 --> 00:41:36.417
if I knew that they really
would not be okay.


924
00:41:36.452 --> 00:41:38.793
I broadcasted my kittens
from the time they were born


925
00:41:38.828 --> 00:41:41.521
until they--
until they went home and uh,


926
00:41:41.556 --> 00:41:44.293
the cats were very popular
and my stream, you know,


927
00:41:44.328 --> 00:41:47.098
used to get a million views,
uh, on average.


928
00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:51.168
I found out
about Alex's double life,


929
00:41:51.203 --> 00:41:53.775
so to speak, probably

930
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.910
when I was like 19.

931
00:41:56.945 --> 00:41:59.308
A part of me was like,
"Is this safe? Is this okay?


932
00:41:59.343 --> 00:42:02.410
Should I, you know,
not be as close to you


933
00:42:02.445 --> 00:42:03.543
when you're doing this?"

934
00:42:03.578 --> 00:42:05.215
Like, I just didn't know.

935
00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.085
She kind of appealed
to my science side


936
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.351
and knew how much I loved that
and would talk to me


937
00:42:09.386 --> 00:42:11.287
a lot about
the psychology of this


938
00:42:11.322 --> 00:42:14.125
and why people feel this way
and why this stuff exists.


939
00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.061
And if you approach me
from that way,


940
00:42:16.096 --> 00:42:18.063
I'm a lot more receptive
to that understanding.


941
00:42:18.098 --> 00:42:21.000
She'd show me things online
or she would explain


942
00:42:21.035 --> 00:42:23.167
why that
this fetish exists


943
00:42:23.202 --> 00:42:25.268
or why these people
did this profession,


944
00:42:25.303 --> 00:42:27.171
and it helped me.

945
00:42:27.206 --> 00:42:30.042
It helped me a lot and
it also opened me to a concept


946
00:42:30.077 --> 00:42:32.946
that there were more
than traditional types of porn.


947
00:42:32.981 --> 00:42:34.574
And once that
kind of hit for me,


948
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:36.345
I really didn't--
I never became


949
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.380
judgmental again, really.

950
00:42:39.251 --> 00:42:41.284
Um...

951
00:42:41.319 --> 00:42:43.220
I do see a connection
between her childhood


952
00:42:43.255 --> 00:42:45.024
and what she does
for a living,


953
00:42:45.059 --> 00:42:47.389
and in the ways that
she has a self-importance


954
00:42:47.424 --> 00:42:49.160
in real life just as
she does in these videos.


955
00:42:49.195 --> 00:42:52.262
And I think that
happened because she was raised


956
00:42:52.297 --> 00:42:54.869
in a situation
that required that for her.


957
00:42:57.269 --> 00:43:00.435
Growing up was not something
I'd like think about much


958
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:02.140
or talk about much.

959
00:43:02.175 --> 00:43:05.110
My mom had-- had her
many mental issues and--


960
00:43:05.145 --> 00:43:06.980
and I came to
find out some, you know,


961
00:43:07.015 --> 00:43:08.377
drug related issues
as well.


962
00:43:09.012 --> 00:43:11.347
Alex was
essentially my mother


963
00:43:11.382 --> 00:43:13.382
and I've actually bought her
Mother's Day gifts


964
00:43:13.417 --> 00:43:15.054
and I've called her
my mother-sister hybrid.


965
00:43:15.089 --> 00:43:17.188
You know, she--
she was that person to me.


966
00:43:18.521 --> 00:43:20.488
The things that my mother--

967
00:43:20.523 --> 00:43:22.325
that my mother did throughout
the course of my childhood,


968
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.030
I should have been
fucked up.


969
00:43:25.264 --> 00:43:28.529
To understand
as a kid,


970
00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:30.333
I used to have
to take money


971
00:43:30.368 --> 00:43:32.038
out of her purse
when she was sleeping


972
00:43:32.073 --> 00:43:33.567
to pay the bills so that
we would have hot water


973
00:43:33.602 --> 00:43:35.404
or that we would
have food or things like that.


974
00:43:35.439 --> 00:43:37.505
Like-- like, she'd had
no functional way really,


975
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.980
or functioning, honestly,
after-- after addiction.


976
00:43:40.015 --> 00:43:42.180
I always went through
some anger, I know, over it.


977
00:43:42.215 --> 00:43:44.017
She saw a lot more
than I did.


978
00:43:44.052 --> 00:43:46.921
You know, when my parents split
I went with my dad,


979
00:43:46.956 --> 00:43:49.253
and she wasn't, um,
my dad's daughter


980
00:43:49.288 --> 00:43:52.421
so we didn't really have the--
an ability to see each other.


981
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:56.656
Um, I know that I was
really attached to her so,


982
00:43:56.691 --> 00:43:58.229
you know,
I remember it hurting.


983
00:43:58.264 --> 00:44:00.099
I remember
it being really hard


984
00:44:00.134 --> 00:44:02.134
and uh--
Oh, geez, I don't wanna cry.


985
00:44:04.039 --> 00:44:06.237
The one thing that our--

986
00:44:06.272 --> 00:44:08.206
rather tumultuous
childhood taught us


987
00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:11.011
was if you hold
on to things from--


988
00:44:11.046 --> 00:44:13.013
from your past,
it takes up room


989
00:44:13.048 --> 00:44:14.344
where love could go.

990
00:44:16.381 --> 00:44:19.514
After I had my son
and she flew me up here, um,


991
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:22.583
and we were just hanging out
and she kind of started to


992
00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:27.555
casually line up her business,
and um, you know, I didn't--


993
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.689
I don't think I got the full
scope immediately as she--


994
00:44:29.724 --> 00:44:31.691
I think I was definitely
fed in a little bit of it.


995
00:44:31.726 --> 00:44:35.266
So I think it was a way to kind
of reconnect us all together


996
00:44:35.301 --> 00:44:38.071
and-- and be honest,
you know, about what she did.


997
00:44:38.106 --> 00:44:42.075
But I feel like the women
who really thrive in femdom


998
00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:44.506
are women who have either
been through adversity


999
00:44:44.541 --> 00:44:47.509
or have been through
situations that have,


1000
00:44:47.544 --> 00:44:49.049
like, tried to
beat them down


1001
00:44:49.084 --> 00:44:50.578
and have become
stronger for it.


1002
00:44:50.613 --> 00:44:53.647
Because you're not
a woman in any business


1003
00:44:53.682 --> 00:44:55.517
without having
a thick skin


1004
00:44:55.552 --> 00:44:58.388
and without having a kick ass
attitude and surviving.


1005
00:44:58.423 --> 00:45:02.260
So I have these guys send me
a list of pirated videos.


1006
00:45:02.295 --> 00:45:04.229
When they find them,
they'll send 'em to you.


1007
00:45:04.264 --> 00:45:06.099
-Right, Right.
-Anytime you find....


1008
00:45:06.134 --> 00:45:07.628
I do a thing
called DMCAs, which is, uh,


1009
00:45:07.663 --> 00:45:09.333
essentially
a privacy protection


1010
00:45:09.368 --> 00:45:11.368
and I have to contact,

1011
00:45:11.403 --> 00:45:13.700
um, the heads of these sites
that are illegally taking


1012
00:45:13.735 --> 00:45:16.736
her videos and using them
for their capital gain,


1013
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:20.212
um, and kind of send them
a request to take it down.


1014
00:45:20.247 --> 00:45:22.049
Alex described it as,
um, you know,


1015
00:45:22.084 --> 00:45:23.479
mushrooms after the rain.

1016
00:45:23.514 --> 00:45:24.645
You're constantly
chopping 'em down


1017
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.284
and they're gonna come back.

1018
00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:27.285
But it's about controlling it.
Yeah.


1019
00:45:31.753 --> 00:45:34.160
This industry porn
in general is going


1020
00:45:34.195 --> 00:45:37.097
more towards
bespoke or custom porn.


1021
00:45:37.132 --> 00:45:39.627
Porn has to change
because it will die


1022
00:45:39.662 --> 00:45:41.761
if we depend on
the same model


1023
00:45:41.796 --> 00:45:43.730
because they're stealing
from us.


1024
00:45:43.765 --> 00:45:46.073
Like, people think, "Oh, yeah,
they'll always make porn,'


1025
00:45:46.108 --> 00:45:47.503
but it
will be shitty porn.


1026
00:45:47.538 --> 00:45:49.439
Just like
they'll always make music,


1027
00:45:49.474 --> 00:45:52.079
but it will be shitty music
because you stole it all.


1028
00:45:52.114 --> 00:45:54.411
So it's definitely
going more towards


1029
00:45:54.446 --> 00:45:59.020
independent
amateur custom porn.


1030
00:45:59.055 --> 00:46:00.780
But I remember
the first few times


1031
00:46:00.815 --> 00:46:03.321
and it was the same-- same
producer that kept taking it,


1032
00:46:03.356 --> 00:46:05.125
or same uploader.

1033
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.127
And I was like, "If I ever
saw this guy in public,


1034
00:46:07.162 --> 00:46:08.755
I would definitely punch him,
like, straight in the face,"


1035
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.131
'cause it's really
disrespectful, you know?


1036
00:46:16.567 --> 00:46:18.138
Thank you Goddess.

1037
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:23.506
First or second date

1038
00:46:23.541 --> 00:46:25.112
is when I tell people
about my job.


1039
00:46:25.147 --> 00:46:27.081
You know, guys
that are my age


1040
00:46:27.116 --> 00:46:30.612
are not the most confident,
especially with the kind of


1041
00:46:30.647 --> 00:46:33.450
work I'm doing, a lot of
the time they're insecure.


1042
00:46:33.485 --> 00:46:35.221
You know, they think
that they're not good enough


1043
00:46:35.256 --> 00:46:37.586
and it's-- it's like,
you know, it's work


1044
00:46:37.621 --> 00:46:40.556
and it's personal relationships
and they-- you know,


1045
00:46:40.591 --> 00:46:42.756
guys don't really
understand how that is.


1046
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:48.300
Everyone knows
that you're with me


1047
00:46:48.335 --> 00:46:52.601
even as I put my hands

1048
00:46:52.636 --> 00:46:57.507
between a strange man's legs
right in front of you all.


1049
00:46:57.542 --> 00:47:01.280
I've seen girls have
their stuff taken down


1050
00:47:01.315 --> 00:47:03.843
that they've done
for years and years


1051
00:47:03.878 --> 00:47:05.416
because their
new boyfriend wants them


1052
00:47:05.451 --> 00:47:06.516
to do something else.

1053
00:47:06.551 --> 00:47:08.221
Red flag number one,

1054
00:47:08.256 --> 00:47:10.421
"Stop doing what you're doing
for me,"


1055
00:47:10.456 --> 00:47:13.655
and it's a guilt thing, like,
"Oh, well if you love me,


1056
00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:15.558
do you care about
that more than me?


1057
00:47:15.593 --> 00:47:17.725
Do you care about everyone
else's dick more than me?"


1058
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.827
Like, that's
a really manipulative way


1059
00:47:20.862 --> 00:47:22.466
to approach that.

1060
00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:24.369
I used to call it
stripper boyfriend


1061
00:47:24.404 --> 00:47:26.305
because that's
where I used to see it.


1062
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:28.373
They would
spend their money


1063
00:47:28.408 --> 00:47:30.507
and play with the Xbox
that they bought them,


1064
00:47:30.542 --> 00:47:33.312
but then call them
a whore at the same time.


1065
00:47:33.347 --> 00:47:35.842
And it is so common
and a lot of people


1066
00:47:35.877 --> 00:47:38.416
are just like,
"I don't date till I retire."


1067
00:47:38.451 --> 00:47:40.847
It's quite challenging,
actually, 'cause you don't know


1068
00:47:40.882 --> 00:47:43.289
if-- if they are
interested in you


1069
00:47:43.324 --> 00:47:45.390
because of your--
of what you do,


1070
00:47:45.425 --> 00:47:47.623
or if they're
really dating you


1071
00:47:47.658 --> 00:47:50.560
because of who you
really are as a person.


1072
00:47:50.595 --> 00:47:53.299
And I have
a really strict


1073
00:47:53.334 --> 00:47:55.862
'no dating a client' policy.

1074
00:47:55.897 --> 00:47:57.468
Very, very strict.

1075
00:47:57.503 --> 00:47:59.239
I have never
broken that rule ever


1076
00:47:59.274 --> 00:48:00.867
since I started
in this business.


1077
00:48:00.902 --> 00:48:04.244
But, you know, when it comes
to me having casual sex


1078
00:48:04.279 --> 00:48:07.214
and, um,
just being me as a girl,


1079
00:48:07.249 --> 00:48:08.776
it-- it's so much fun--
it helps.


1080
00:48:08.811 --> 00:48:12.153
Them knowing
that I'm a FemDom and that,


1081
00:48:12.188 --> 00:48:14.815
you know, it'll be
a fun sexual experience,


1082
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.850
it's always, uh--
it always comes in handy


1083
00:48:16.885 --> 00:48:18.258
when I try
to pick up men.


1084
00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.821
I was actually, uh,
I was going on a second date


1085
00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:23.461
with a guy that I kind of,
you know, I kind of liked.


1086
00:48:23.496 --> 00:48:25.496
You know, I hadn't really
made up my mind about him yet.


1087
00:48:25.531 --> 00:48:27.828
And he brags to me that
he's told all of his friends,


1088
00:48:27.863 --> 00:48:29.566
"Oh, I'm going on a date
with a dominatrix."


1089
00:48:29.601 --> 00:48:31.601
And I was like,
"And now we have no more date."


1090
00:48:31.636 --> 00:48:33.339
And he's like, "Why?

1091
00:48:33.374 --> 00:48:34.835
Well, I just find you
really interesting."


1092
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:36.606
And I said,
"You have distilled me down


1093
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:39.642
to my profession,
but I am not my job, okay?


1094
00:48:39.677 --> 00:48:41.380
I put--
I breathe life into my job,


1095
00:48:41.415 --> 00:48:43.349
my job does not
breathe life into me."


1096
00:48:43.851 --> 00:48:45.516
When''s the last time...

1097
00:48:46.783 --> 00:48:50.587
you were truly happy?

1098
00:48:50.622 --> 00:48:52.457
Alex likes
to care for others.


1099
00:48:52.492 --> 00:48:55.625
Alex loves to give back
to others and support others.


1100
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.364
Um, but it's a--
it's a major problem for me


1101
00:48:58.399 --> 00:48:59.959
with a lot of the people
in her life


1102
00:48:59.994 --> 00:49:02.170
who don't care for her
and support her enough.


1103
00:49:02.705 --> 00:49:05.503
I fit into Alex's life
as her creative other half.


1104
00:49:05.538 --> 00:49:07.769
Alex and I are each
one piece of a happy soul.


1105
00:49:07.804 --> 00:49:09.573
She's somebody
I love so much


1106
00:49:09.608 --> 00:49:11.212
and to see
somebody that you love...


1107
00:49:12.248 --> 00:49:14.281
heartbroken or struggling

1108
00:49:14.316 --> 00:49:16.976
and there's nothing
you can do to fix it,


1109
00:49:17.011 --> 00:49:18.516
is really difficult.

1110
00:49:18.551 --> 00:49:21.882
After Alex left
her marriage,


1111
00:49:21.917 --> 00:49:24.654
uh, she also left
the studio


1112
00:49:24.689 --> 00:49:27.657
and we didn't see her
for long periods of time.


1113
00:49:27.692 --> 00:49:29.230
And when that happened,

1114
00:49:29.265 --> 00:49:30.990
things really
started to change.


1115
00:49:31.025 --> 00:49:33.729
I would say they really
started to go downhill.


1116
00:49:34.264 --> 00:49:36.567
The way that we'd
split the business was that


1117
00:49:36.602 --> 00:49:39.669
I still maintained
ownership of the dungeon.


1118
00:49:39.704 --> 00:49:42.342
Like all-- all the content
in the dungeon and its name


1119
00:49:42.377 --> 00:49:44.674
and the training program
that I developed,


1120
00:49:44.709 --> 00:49:48.282
and that he would operate
its day-to-day activities.


1121
00:49:48.817 --> 00:49:50.647
We were still
working the same amount,


1122
00:49:50.682 --> 00:49:52.682
but we were
making a lot less.


1123
00:49:52.717 --> 00:49:54.948
And I would say
we were actually


1124
00:49:54.983 --> 00:49:57.489
even working harder,
putting in more hours,


1125
00:49:57.524 --> 00:49:58.820
taking more sessions.

1126
00:49:59.322 --> 00:50:01.559
And I'd look at the schedule
and I would see like--


1127
00:50:01.594 --> 00:50:03.297
like there'd be
nothing for few weeks,


1128
00:50:03.332 --> 00:50:04.529
and then there'd be
all these sessions


1129
00:50:04.564 --> 00:50:06.333
and nothing
for a few weeks.


1130
00:50:06.368 --> 00:50:07.598
And I'm like, "God,
that's gonna be so difficult


1131
00:50:07.633 --> 00:50:08.830
for the girls to do."

1132
00:50:08.865 --> 00:50:09.964
Like, I mean, it's-- like,

1133
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.372
it just seemed to be--
it seemed to be a lot of work.


1134
00:50:12.407 --> 00:50:14.869
Joseph is a very
charismatic individual.


1135
00:50:14.904 --> 00:50:18.411
I met Joseph
right off the bat, um,


1136
00:50:18.446 --> 00:50:20.479
when Alex and I were starting
to get to know each other,


1137
00:50:20.514 --> 00:50:23.449
and he is an engaging
individual.


1138
00:50:23.484 --> 00:50:25.814
He's-- uh,
on the surface,


1139
00:50:25.849 --> 00:50:27.552
he seems to have it all
put together.


1140
00:50:27.587 --> 00:50:28.949
He seems to be
very coordinated.


1141
00:50:28.984 --> 00:50:30.588
He seems to be
very on top of it.


1142
00:50:30.623 --> 00:50:33.558
If we had a problem,
it was Alex


1143
00:50:33.593 --> 00:50:35.692
who would go
and talk to Joseph


1144
00:50:35.727 --> 00:50:37.562
and, you know,
fight the fight.


1145
00:50:37.597 --> 00:50:39.630
You know,
we lost our advocate


1146
00:50:39.665 --> 00:50:42.534
and Joseph has
a very loud voice


1147
00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:45.834
in a lot of ways
and, um, we--


1148
00:50:45.869 --> 00:50:48.672
we weren't able to stand up
for ourselves as well.


1149
00:50:49.939 --> 00:50:51.345
I sort
of felt worried.


1150
00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:53.072
I started to go,
"Okay, well,


1151
00:50:53.107 --> 00:50:56.416
if I get a phone call tomorrow
that, you know, like,


1152
00:50:56.451 --> 00:50:58.979
the lease hasn't been paid,
what am I gonna do?


1153
00:50:59.014 --> 00:51:00.618
Like, if I get
a phone call tomorrow,


1154
00:51:00.653 --> 00:51:01.982
like, well, about--
about, you know,


1155
00:51:02.017 --> 00:51:03.654
one of the girls
wants to quit."


1156
00:51:03.689 --> 00:51:05.425
And I was realizing
I didn't want


1157
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.328
to run the dungeon
the way that I had before.


1158
00:51:07.363 --> 00:51:08.395
It was exhausting.

1159
00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:11.695
You know, I'm gonna,
unfortunately, have to continue


1160
00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:15.028
to untie things
from him legally.


1161
00:51:15.063 --> 00:51:17.096
I had kind of left
some things here and there


1162
00:51:17.131 --> 00:51:18.966
because I was like,
"Hey, we trust each other and--


1163
00:51:19.001 --> 00:51:20.968
and, you know,
divorce sucks and it's messy.


1164
00:51:21.003 --> 00:51:23.410
And, like, unraveling
a business is messy."


1165
00:51:23.445 --> 00:51:25.104
And now
I have to be aggressive


1166
00:51:25.139 --> 00:51:27.315
about unraveling
these things.


1167
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.549
I'm gonna
have to go in and either


1168
00:51:30.584 --> 00:51:33.079
exert control over it
and reclaim it


1169
00:51:33.114 --> 00:51:34.883
or decide
what's gonna have to go


1170
00:51:34.918 --> 00:51:35.983
and what's gonna stay.

1171
00:51:38.152 --> 00:51:40.988
I do feel like,
sex work is work...


1172
00:51:42.464 --> 00:51:43.529
and...

1173
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:48.633
you know that people are gonna
say you're a whore.


1174
00:51:48.668 --> 00:51:50.470
"Like you're a fucking whore.

1175
00:51:50.505 --> 00:51:51.768
Like, oh, you can't--
You're so stupid.


1176
00:51:51.803 --> 00:51:53.539
You-- you can't
use your talent.


1177
00:51:53.574 --> 00:51:55.376
So, you--
There's nothing going for you.


1178
00:51:55.411 --> 00:51:56.971
It is where you have to use
your body to make money


1179
00:51:57.006 --> 00:51:58.643
or you have to use
sex to make money."


1180
00:51:58.678 --> 00:52:01.107
And I think that,
yes and no, because


1181
00:52:01.142 --> 00:52:03.076
I feel like I'm smart,

1182
00:52:03.111 --> 00:52:05.782
because I figured out that
I can use this to make money.


1183
00:52:05.817 --> 00:52:07.146
I built a business.

1184
00:52:07.181 --> 00:52:09.115
I, you know,
I-- I pay my taxes.


1185
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:11.623
I-- I'm a--
I'm a legit company, you know?


1186
00:52:12.192 --> 00:52:15.627
It's not that all sex work
is empowering because it's not.


1187
00:52:16.563 --> 00:52:20.467
But it's not empowering,
not because it's sex work,


1188
00:52:20.502 --> 00:52:22.964
it's not empowering
because we do not empower


1189
00:52:22.999 --> 00:52:25.835
sex workers
in our institutions.


1190
00:52:26.937 --> 00:52:28.002
Let's begin.

1191
00:52:29.577 --> 00:52:32.941
I want you to take
a nice deep breath.


1192
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:40.784
These are
some of my favorite.


1193
00:52:40.819 --> 00:52:42.489
These subliminal style videos.

1194
00:52:42.524 --> 00:52:44.887
Um, they sell
really well and, uh,


1195
00:52:44.922 --> 00:52:47.021
they're a lot of work to make,

1196
00:52:47.056 --> 00:52:48.891
but they're, like,

1197
00:52:48.926 --> 00:52:50.794
really trippy to watch.

1198
00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:52.994
When it comes to
what we can and cannot say


1199
00:52:53.029 --> 00:52:55.766
when we upload clips, um,
what we can and cannot use


1200
00:52:55.801 --> 00:52:57.801
in titles
and in descriptions,


1201
00:52:57.836 --> 00:52:59.836
um, it has more to do
with the banks


1202
00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:02.971
and the credit card companies
than it has to do with, um,


1203
00:53:03.006 --> 00:53:06.777
how we believe
the content actually is.


1204
00:53:06.812 --> 00:53:10.209
The best ways
you can serve me


1205
00:53:10.244 --> 00:53:13.916
is with your
financial worship.


1206
00:53:13.951 --> 00:53:15.951
You're putting them
into a mind state,


1207
00:53:15.986 --> 00:53:17.821
um, where they don't have
control over their bodies,


1208
00:53:17.856 --> 00:53:19.691
and then
you can make them--


1209
00:53:19.726 --> 00:53:21.825
make them do things
that they don't wanna do.


1210
00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.794
Which isn't real, which isn't
a true thing about hypnosis.


1211
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:25.664
It is a perception
about hypnosis


1212
00:53:25.699 --> 00:53:26.995
that banks
and credit card companies


1213
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:28.601
don't wanna be
associated with.


1214
00:53:28.636 --> 00:53:30.097
You want to see me--

1215
00:53:31.672 --> 00:53:34.706
Have everything
my heart desires?


1216
00:53:35.442 --> 00:53:37.104
They work
in a certain way.


1217
00:53:37.139 --> 00:53:39.711
I know because, uh,
I fall asleep sometimes


1218
00:53:39.746 --> 00:53:41.581
while, um,
editing them.


1219
00:53:41.616 --> 00:53:43.880
I can't edit
hypno videos after lunch.


1220
00:53:43.915 --> 00:53:49.886
Good boy. Good boy.

1221
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:53.021
There's sort of that myth
of the ''captain save a hoe'--


1222
00:53:53.056 --> 00:53:55.991
-With sex workers that--

1223
00:53:56.026 --> 00:53:59.533
that, "I-- I will
save them from themselves.


1224
00:53:59.568 --> 00:54:02.734
These girls, they don't know
what they're getting into.


1225
00:54:02.769 --> 00:54:04.736
They're being
taken advantage of."


1226
00:54:04.771 --> 00:54:06.232
Are-- are there
women and girls


1227
00:54:06.267 --> 00:54:07.772
being taken advantage of
in the world?


1228
00:54:07.807 --> 00:54:09.873
Absolutely.

1229
00:54:09.908 --> 00:54:13.140
Some of it
is through sex work.


1230
00:54:13.175 --> 00:54:15.879
Uh, most of it
is through our everyday


1231
00:54:15.914 --> 00:54:17.782
interactions and institutions.

1232
00:54:20.688 --> 00:54:24.624

00:54:32.194 --> 00:54:35.129
<i>For too long,</i>
<i>bad actor websites</i>


1237
00:54:35.164 --> 00:54:38.902
<i>have operated with impunity</i>
<i>in selling young women</i>


1238
00:54:38.937 --> 00:54:42.103
<i>and girls forced into</i>
<i>the commercial sale of sex.</i>


1239
00:54:42.138 --> 00:54:44.809
<i>They have misused</i>

<i>in state courts.</i>

1242
00:54:49.013 --> 00:54:51.178
The intention
of FOSTA and SESTA


1243
00:54:51.213 --> 00:54:53.719
was to limit the avenues

1244
00:54:53.754 --> 00:54:55.655
in which people could use
the internet


1245
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:56.986
for sex trafficking,

1246
00:54:57.021 --> 00:54:59.021
but what actually happened

1247
00:54:59.056 --> 00:55:01.826
was that
it made websites liable


1248
00:55:01.861 --> 00:55:04.565
for the content
that independent people


1249
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.567
put onto those websites.

1250
00:55:06.602 --> 00:55:09.636
All of the clip sites and all
of the social media sites


1251
00:55:09.671 --> 00:55:12.166
were immediately
very, very frightened.


1252
00:55:12.201 --> 00:55:13.706
Alex lost her

1253
00:55:13.741 --> 00:55:16.610
60,000 follower
Instagram account


1254
00:55:16.645 --> 00:55:17.908
pretty much immediately.

1255
00:55:17.943 --> 00:55:19.877
So on its face
SESTA and FOSTA


1256
00:55:19.912 --> 00:55:21.714
seemed like
a very good idea,


1257
00:55:21.749 --> 00:55:24.310
but as with most things
that affect sex workers


1258
00:55:24.345 --> 00:55:26.686
it's often
rolled up in something


1259
00:55:26.721 --> 00:55:28.853
that everyone universally
thinks is terrible,


1260
00:55:28.888 --> 00:55:31.152
such as sex trafficking
or child pornography.


1261
00:55:31.187 --> 00:55:33.825
And what it ever fails
to address is that


1262
00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:37.862
people who-- who do trade
any type of sexual services,


1263
00:55:37.897 --> 00:55:40.997
legally or illegally,
are-- are marginalized in it.


1264
00:55:41.032 --> 00:55:44.638
The biggest thing was
that many-- many sex workers


1265
00:55:44.673 --> 00:55:48.367
who had-- had transitioned
to online or, um,


1266
00:55:48.402 --> 00:55:51.271
indoor locations for--
for sex work,


1267
00:55:51.306 --> 00:55:53.207
now were forced outdoors.

1268
00:55:53.242 --> 00:55:55.374
They're now
forced in the street.


1269
00:55:55.409 --> 00:55:58.047
<i>Prosecutors tell</i>
<i>me that they would oftentimes</i>


1270
00:55:58.082 --> 00:56:00.181
<i>prefer to use</i>
<i>prostitution laws</i>


1271
00:56:00.216 --> 00:56:02.051
<i>instead of</i>
<i>sex trafficking laws,</i>


1272
00:56:02.086 --> 00:56:03.987
<i>when charging</i>
<i>these websites.</i>


1273
00:56:04.022 --> 00:56:06.660
<i>FOSTA gives prosecutors</i>

1274
00:56:06.695 --> 00:56:09.355
<i>the freedom to use both.</i>

1275
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:12.798
So one of the pages or websites
that was shut down


1276
00:56:12.833 --> 00:56:15.031
because of SESTA and FOSTA
was Backpage,


1277
00:56:15.066 --> 00:56:18.738
which is an advertising site
and a blacklisting site.


1278
00:56:18.773 --> 00:56:21.367
That is also where,
um, adult workers


1279
00:56:21.402 --> 00:56:23.171
write reviews of clients.

1280
00:56:23.206 --> 00:56:25.140
You know,
people that have been abusive


1281
00:56:25.175 --> 00:56:28.308
or have harassed them
or blackmailed them, so that,


1282
00:56:28.343 --> 00:56:31.080
you know, no other sex workers
have to work with them.


1283
00:56:31.115 --> 00:56:33.687
And now
all this information is lost.


1284
00:56:33.722 --> 00:56:37.955
A lot of escorts
and, you know, doms,


1285
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:39.352
or people
that are-- you know,


1286
00:56:39.387 --> 00:56:41.255
do that kind of exchange
on that site,


1287
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:43.158
they're going out
with new clients


1288
00:56:43.193 --> 00:56:44.896
that they've
never met before


1289
00:56:44.931 --> 00:56:46.964
who may have had
a bad review


1290
00:56:46.999 --> 00:56:49.065
and now they're
totally in danger.


1291
00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.431
FOSTA combined with
the SESTA Walter's amendment


1292
00:56:52.466 --> 00:56:56.105
that adds back
in victim-centered provisions


1293
00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.041
from my original language,

1294
00:56:58.076 --> 00:57:02.012
will finally create these
serious legal consequences.


1295
00:57:02.047 --> 00:57:04.982
That's kind of the--
one of the foundations


1296
00:57:05.017 --> 00:57:06.082
of working
in this industry.


1297
00:57:06.117 --> 00:57:07.754
Things will change,

1298
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:09.316
because the rules
change all the time


1299
00:57:09.351 --> 00:57:11.450
and you don't get a say
in whatever is happening


1300
00:57:11.485 --> 00:57:13.056
at any one point in time.

1301
00:57:13.091 --> 00:57:14.827
Sites can change
what they allow,


1302
00:57:14.862 --> 00:57:16.422
what fetishes they allow.

1303
00:57:16.457 --> 00:57:18.864
Um, other sites can change
what kind of content


1304
00:57:18.899 --> 00:57:20.393
that you can talk about
in your messages.


1305
00:57:20.428 --> 00:57:22.032
And sometimes
the laws change


1306
00:57:22.067 --> 00:57:23.935
and unfortunately,
because we are not


1307
00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:25.772
a protected class of anything,

1308
00:57:25.807 --> 00:57:27.906
we just have to pivot,
we just have to switch


1309
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:29.369
and we just
have to keep going forward.


1310
00:57:29.404 --> 00:57:31.404
We're not easy people
to stand up for.


1311
00:57:31.806 --> 00:57:35.342
Why in the world do we have
an entire class of people


1312
00:57:35.377 --> 00:57:38.444
for whom it is very
easy to consider them


1313
00:57:38.479 --> 00:57:41.084
less than human

00:59:46.079 --> 00:59:47.507
I'm not gonna let you,
you know, drown.


1357
00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:49.212
Don't worry.

1358
00:59:49.247 --> 00:59:50.576
But I'm also not gonna
give you a free pass."


1359
00:59:50.611 --> 00:59:52.017
Finally.

1360
00:59:52.052 --> 00:59:53.854
Finally,
I have a daughter


1361
00:59:53.889 --> 00:59:55.515
I can give
all of my clothes to.


1362
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:56.824
-Just kidding.

1363
00:59:58.256 --> 01:00:00.157
Thanks sex mom.

1364
01:00:00.192 --> 01:00:02.357
What's interesting is that
the-- the best content


1365
01:00:02.392 --> 01:00:04.931
that is made by--
by male producers,


1366
01:00:04.966 --> 01:00:06.625
at least,
specifically inside femdom,


1367
01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.264
seems to be
made by-- by guys


1368
01:00:08.299 --> 01:00:10.464
who are inclined
to be submissive.


1369
01:00:10.499 --> 01:00:12.565
And that's just really because
they get the kink, right?


1370
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.402
For the same reason
that, like, we get the kink.


1371
01:00:14.437 --> 01:00:17.174
But honestly, they get the kink
better than I do


1372
01:00:17.209 --> 01:00:18.945
because obviously,

1373
01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.947
the person who's
watching it the most often


1374
01:00:20.982 --> 01:00:22.410
is a male submissive, right?

1375
01:00:22.812 --> 01:00:24.885
I'll show you what my site is,
what it's about


1376
01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.612
and how the shoots
generally work.


1377
01:00:27.147 --> 01:00:29.483
The storylines
mostly come from my head.


1378
01:00:29.518 --> 01:00:31.892
You know, as I said,
I'm a sub and-- and, uh,


1379
01:00:31.927 --> 01:00:33.388
I enjoy
these types of things,


1380
01:00:33.423 --> 01:00:36.358
so I spend a lot of time
coming up with ideas


1381
01:00:36.393 --> 01:00:38.998
and, uh, I get a lot--
a lot of great clip ideas


1382
01:00:39.033 --> 01:00:40.626
from the members
of the site.


1383
01:00:40.661 --> 01:00:43.101
And generally what I do is
I come up with a list


1384
01:00:43.136 --> 01:00:46.137
of ideas and, uh,
I'd like you to go over


1385
01:00:46.172 --> 01:00:49.008
and look at them and pick out
which ones you like.


1386
01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:50.570
''Cause obviously,
the ones you like more,


1387
01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:52.209
you're gonna be
able to speak better about.


1388
01:00:52.244 --> 01:00:53.276
You're gonna
have fun doing and--


1389
01:00:53.311 --> 01:00:54.376
Mm-hmm.

1390
01:00:56.446 --> 01:00:58.985
He had a lot of good ideas.

1391
01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.549
He had, uh, a huge list
of prompts to pick from.


1392
01:01:02.584 --> 01:01:04.518
We're rolling with,
"I love knowing that


1393
01:01:04.553 --> 01:01:06.454
you're sitting at home
jerking off alone in your room


1394
01:01:06.489 --> 01:01:08.390
about to eat
your own cum for me."


1395
01:01:08.425 --> 01:01:09.963
Take one.

1396
01:01:09.998 --> 01:01:11.393
So you've come to the end

1397
01:01:11.428 --> 01:01:13.560
of a very long day,
haven't you?


1398
01:01:13.595 --> 01:01:16.299
And you've come to me,
to my videos.


1399
01:01:16.334 --> 01:01:18.070
Like, he's still there
behind the camera,


1400
01:01:18.105 --> 01:01:20.435
and as I'm rattling off
and I'm talking


1401
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.272
and he's shaking his head

1402
01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:24.307
and giving me
a thumbs up and--


1403
01:01:24.342 --> 01:01:26.144
or he's, like,
laughing a little bit.


1404
01:01:26.179 --> 01:01:28.344
So that--
that really encourages me


1405
01:01:28.379 --> 01:01:30.115
when I'm in front of the camera

1406
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:33.019
and I'm, you know,
just making the words.


1407
01:01:33.054 --> 01:01:35.285
Let me get
that little last bit.


1408
01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.155
Just keep going

1409
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:39.025
until there's just
a little left right here...


1410
01:01:40.193 --> 01:01:41.258
and you lick that.

1411
01:01:43.493 --> 01:01:45.262
That felt good, huh?

1412
01:01:45.297 --> 01:01:47.330
A lot of girls say
they can just


1413
01:01:47.365 --> 01:01:49.431
do this by turning
the camera on themselves


1414
01:01:49.466 --> 01:01:51.334
and not having
anyone around, and--


1415
01:01:51.369 --> 01:01:54.106
so why would they need
to go shoot in front of a guy?


1416
01:01:54.141 --> 01:01:55.437
So it is hard, you know,

1417
01:01:55.472 --> 01:01:57.109
and I spent
a lot of years


1418
01:01:57.144 --> 01:02:00.046
really trying
to build my reputation


1419
01:02:00.081 --> 01:02:03.082
as someone that girls
could feel comfortable around.


1420
01:02:03.451 --> 01:02:05.018
-That was great.
-Okay.


1421
01:02:05.053 --> 01:02:06.646
Yeah,
it was really, really good.


1422
01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.186
By the time
I'm-- I'm done and I edit it


1423
01:02:08.221 --> 01:02:09.451
and put it all together,
it'll have nice transitions,


1424
01:02:09.486 --> 01:02:11.189
it'll flow.

1425
01:02:11.224 --> 01:02:12.718
One thing
I've always need to work on


1426
01:02:12.753 --> 01:02:14.687
when it comes to performing
or presenting


1427
01:02:14.722 --> 01:02:17.261
is talking slower.

1428
01:02:17.296 --> 01:02:18.757
Actually, your--
your pace was pretty good.


1429
01:02:18.792 --> 01:02:20.726
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.


1430
01:02:20.761 --> 01:02:22.365
Your delivery was actually--
is actually very, very good.


1431
01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.564
Raevyn is
a natural pervert, right?


1432
01:02:23.599 --> 01:02:25.566
She's gonna conceptualize

1433
01:02:25.601 --> 01:02:27.766
the-- the scenes
a lot differently


1434
01:02:27.801 --> 01:02:30.736
than-- than someone
who is really playing pretend.


1435
01:02:30.771 --> 01:02:33.145
Uh, and I think for her,

1436
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.114
the physical activity
of doing things


1437
01:02:35.149 --> 01:02:37.743
comes a lot easier than just
talking about doing things.


1438
01:02:37.778 --> 01:02:41.153
Okay, uh,
we're rolling with, uh,


1439
01:02:41.188 --> 01:02:43.287
"Satanic blasphemy."
Take one.


1440
01:02:43.322 --> 01:02:46.125
I met Alexandra Snow,
uh, I am pretty sure


1441
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.094
it's been a few years,
but I'm pretty sure


1442
01:02:48.129 --> 01:02:50.129
I reached out
and contacted her.


1443
01:02:50.164 --> 01:02:51.691
Um, she has always been

1444
01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:54.595
one of the top three
Clips4Sale girls,


1445
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:56.696
um, you know,
and someone I highly--


1446
01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:59.369
you know, I-- I knew
would do very well on my site.


1447
01:02:59.404 --> 01:03:02.702
Were you a good,
good little church boy?


1448
01:03:04.838 --> 01:03:08.114
Did you always do

1449
01:03:08.149 --> 01:03:10.083
all the right things?

1450
01:03:10.118 --> 01:03:14.351
All that morality didn't
make you very happy, did it?


1451
01:03:14.386 --> 01:03:15.451
No, it didn't.

1452
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.025
Very good.

1453
01:03:18.927 --> 01:03:22.557
And tell me,
it does feel good, doesn't it?


1454
01:03:22.592 --> 01:03:24.361
Touch your cock for me.

1455
01:03:24.396 --> 01:03:26.495
They told you to beware
of women like me.


1456
01:03:27.097 --> 01:03:29.531
And cut it
and move here.


1457
01:03:29.566 --> 01:03:30.796
-Closer?
-Yeah, go ahead.


1458
01:03:30.831 --> 01:03:32.105
Oh, cut it first...

1459
01:03:33.735 --> 01:03:36.307
''cause I'm gonna
go get a Bible.


1460
01:03:39.114 --> 01:03:40.542
She gets the mind game.

1461
01:03:40.577 --> 01:03:42.379
You know,
she knows what to say.


1462
01:03:42.414 --> 01:03:44.414
She knows
how to play to the camera.


1463
01:03:44.449 --> 01:03:46.482
I mean, she--
she's the whole package.


1464
01:03:46.517 --> 01:03:49.452
You know, and not only that,
but as-- as being a top seller,


1465
01:03:49.487 --> 01:03:51.058
you know, uh...

1466
01:03:52.027 --> 01:03:54.226
you know, I just saw it
as a complete win for--


1467
01:03:54.261 --> 01:03:57.130
for my website to have someone
who had a big name,


1468
01:03:57.165 --> 01:04:00.496
um, and who, you know,
had lots of followers.


1469
01:04:01.265 --> 01:04:03.301
I'll read you
a little passage right here.


1470
01:04:05.173 --> 01:04:06.634
"She's a tree of life to them

1471
01:04:06.669 --> 01:04:09.340
lay hold upon her
and happy is everyone


1472
01:04:09.375 --> 01:04:10.671
that retaineth her"

1473
01:04:13.544 --> 01:04:14.609
Worshiping me?

1474
01:04:16.877 --> 01:04:19.812
This is your new salvation.

1475
01:04:25.193 --> 01:04:26.588
-Okay.
-Perfect.


1476
01:04:26.623 --> 01:04:28.260
That's gonna do
really well for me.


1477
01:04:28.295 --> 01:04:30.427
-That was fantastic.
-Yeah. Yeah. Good.


1478
01:04:31.062 --> 01:04:33.199
Watching Alex shoot

1479
01:04:33.234 --> 01:04:34.761
and, uh,
perform for him,


1480
01:04:34.796 --> 01:04:36.202
that helped me a lot.

1481
01:04:36.237 --> 01:04:37.632
She's-- she's great.

1482
01:04:37.667 --> 01:04:39.304
She's very fluid
with what she does,


1483
01:04:39.339 --> 01:04:41.240
so I-- I took
a few mental notes.


1484
01:04:41.275 --> 01:04:43.572
I always felt, like, sometimes,
when you go down the route


1485
01:04:43.607 --> 01:04:45.871
of-- of religious videos,
it collects


1486
01:04:45.906 --> 01:04:48.148
a little bit of bad karma,
you know what I mean?


1487
01:04:48.183 --> 01:04:50.447
Like, I get a lot of requests
where people want me to, like,


1488
01:04:50.482 --> 01:04:52.317
to piss on the Bible or,
you know, to like,


1489
01:04:52.352 --> 01:04:54.418
rip up pages out of,
you know, the Quran and stuff.


1490
01:04:54.453 --> 01:04:56.189
And I get it.
I understand it.


1491
01:04:56.224 --> 01:04:57.685
It's definitely not for me.

1492
01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.885
It's mostly just because I--

1493
01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.690
I really
don't want to downplay


1494
01:05:02.725 --> 01:05:05.231
anything positive that--

1495
01:05:05.266 --> 01:05:07.629
that group's culture
has ever done for it.


1496
01:05:07.664 --> 01:05:09.466
And I feel like a lot of--
a lot of religion


1497
01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:11.270
makes you feel ashamed,

1498
01:05:11.305 --> 01:05:12.667
so maybe that's
a good thing to get away from.


1499
01:05:12.702 --> 01:05:13.866
Also, I just wanna
spank people with this bible.


1500
01:05:13.901 --> 01:05:15.175
.

1501
01:05:16.805 --> 01:05:18.541
Some people
wear that amount of makeup.


1502
01:05:18.576 --> 01:05:19.674
-Do you like?
-That's what I'm saying.


1503
01:05:19.709 --> 01:05:21.181
Yeah, normally.

1504
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:26.351
Alex wanted to keep
things very cordial, and, um,


1505
01:05:26.386 --> 01:05:28.617
open with-with her divorce

1506
01:05:28.652 --> 01:05:31.719
and-- and with her ex
she was trying very hard


1507
01:05:31.754 --> 01:05:34.524
to not rock a boat,
to do things smoothly.


1508
01:05:34.559 --> 01:05:36.955
Um, still owning
a business together and still--


1509
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:38.825
I mean, they all shared
the same friends, you know?


1510
01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:41.267
Like, it--
it's a big life change


1511
01:05:41.302 --> 01:05:43.236
so I know that
she wanted to be as, uh,


1512
01:05:43.271 --> 01:05:46.833
mature and smooth
as possible, initially.


1513
01:05:48.507 --> 01:05:51.541
So, you know, I-- I--
I have been really careful


1514
01:05:51.576 --> 01:05:53.246
up until this point

1515
01:05:53.281 --> 01:05:55.875
about not wanting
to badmouth Joseph.


1516
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:59.384
Mostly because it's really easy
to look like a vengeful ex


1517
01:05:59.419 --> 01:06:02.453
and there's kind of no way
for me to be able to describe


1518
01:06:02.488 --> 01:06:04.686
so much of the things
that have happened,


1519
01:06:04.721 --> 01:06:06.358
that I let happen and,
you know,


1520
01:06:06.393 --> 01:06:07.689
I participated in
and all that stuff.


1521
01:06:34.355 --> 01:06:36.256
He wouldn't even let me
meet the new staff,


1522
01:06:36.291 --> 01:06:37.917
let alone train them.

1523
01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:39.655
I'm not gonna have my name
attached to any of that.


1524
01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:41.822
Like, I've worked--
worked too hard,


1525
01:06:41.857 --> 01:06:44.594
uh, to build--

1526
01:06:44.629 --> 01:06:46.563
to build the--
the ethical foundation


1527
01:06:46.598 --> 01:06:48.862
that the whole place
has been run on, right?


1528
01:06:48.897 --> 01:06:51.502
When Alex was gone, um,

1529
01:06:51.537 --> 01:06:53.999
where we were
encouraged to take


1530
01:06:54.034 --> 01:06:56.441
sessions that we
wouldn't normally take,


1531
01:06:56.476 --> 01:06:58.476
um, indulge in fetishes

1532
01:06:58.511 --> 01:07:01.809
that were
not necessarily our bag, um,


1533
01:07:01.844 --> 01:07:03.514
film custom videos

1534
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:04.878
that weren't
necessarily something


1535
01:07:04.913 --> 01:07:06.715
that we would normally do.

1536
01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:10.290
And I think a lot of that
had financial reasons.


1537
01:07:10.325 --> 01:07:12.853
You know,
we-- we were encouraged


1538
01:07:12.888 --> 01:07:14.492
to not ever say no.

1539
01:07:15.330 --> 01:07:16.890
I'll put it that way.

1540
01:07:16.925 --> 01:07:19.563
The entire arrangement
that we had was that,


1541
01:07:19.598 --> 01:07:21.059
you know, I-
- I was--

1542
01:07:21.094 --> 01:07:23.028
I was going to help
transition the business,


1543
01:07:23.063 --> 01:07:24.832
the-- the one portion
of the business over to him


1544
01:07:24.867 --> 01:07:26.966
and then,
you know, go into my--


1545
01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:28.902
into my business, um,

1546
01:07:28.937 --> 01:07:30.574
and still stay involved,

1547
01:07:30.609 --> 01:07:31.740
you know,
with the dungeon and stuff.


1548
01:07:31.775 --> 01:07:33.280
And-- and he just...

1549
01:07:35.812 --> 01:07:38.483
Things with Joseph now
are quite--


1550
01:07:38.518 --> 01:07:40.518
quite odd.

1551
01:07:40.553 --> 01:07:43.983
Um, Joseph on the surface
will tell Alex one thing,


1552
01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.854
but then his actions will say
a different thing.


1553
01:07:46.889 --> 01:07:48.757
Joseph on the surface
will say,


1554
01:07:48.792 --> 01:07:50.792
you know, "Hey, I'm going to
sign these papers,"


1555
01:07:50.827 --> 01:07:52.860
or, "I'm going to do this, this
and this for the business."


1556
01:07:52.895 --> 01:07:55.830
And Joseph on the other hand,
will not do any of those things


1557
01:07:55.865 --> 01:07:58.932
and continue to put things off
and delay as long as he can.


1558
01:07:58.967 --> 01:08:00.934
Even when Alex asks him,
you know?


1559
01:08:11.848 --> 01:08:14.651
You know, he started
lying outright to me about--


1560
01:08:14.686 --> 01:08:16.785
lots of things that changed,
the passwords locked me on.


1561
01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:18.688
Like, I-- I was
half expecting to, you know,


1562
01:08:18.723 --> 01:08:20.426
go in and find
that the dungeon door's locked


1563
01:08:20.461 --> 01:08:21.823
or something like that.

1564
01:08:21.858 --> 01:08:23.957
A lot of us were
being played off Alex


1565
01:08:23.992 --> 01:08:25.090
and, um...

1566
01:08:26.434 --> 01:08:28.797
I think that was
very carefully crafted.


1567
01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:31.129
I think that was
a calculated move,


1568
01:08:31.164 --> 01:08:34.770
and that's really where
I started to question things.


1569
01:08:50.986 --> 01:08:52.656
Um, I dunno
what's gonna happen with--


1570
01:08:52.691 --> 01:08:55.560
with-- with the dungeon
in its current form,


1571
01:08:55.595 --> 01:08:57.089
but at this point,

1572
01:08:57.124 --> 01:09:00.059
the point
that I'm currently at, um,


1573
01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:02.028
I-- I might just
fucking close it.


1574
01:09:07.772 --> 01:09:09.442
I'm usually
the one who's directing it


1575
01:09:09.477 --> 01:09:11.169
as well as being in it.

1576
01:09:11.204 --> 01:09:13.072
If I have you in a position,
I have you doing something


1577
01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:14.711
and like something doesn't
feel right or, you know,


1578
01:09:14.746 --> 01:09:16.416
like, something
that's going wrong,


1579
01:09:16.451 --> 01:09:18.143
-just speak up and tell me.
-Okay.


1580
01:09:18.178 --> 01:09:19.914
Um, in the videos, you know,
call me-- call me Goddess,


1581
01:09:19.949 --> 01:09:21.883
or call me Ms. Snow
or call me, ma'am.


1582
01:09:21.918 --> 01:09:24.622
And if we need to stop rolling
for any particular reason,


1583
01:09:24.657 --> 01:09:27.185
you can always say stop,
or just talk to me.


1584
01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:29.088
-I-- I'll manage it for you.
-Okay, cool.


1585
01:09:29.123 --> 01:09:30.562
-Sound good?
-Yeah.


1586
01:09:30.597 --> 01:09:31.893
Great.

1587
01:09:31.928 --> 01:09:34.467
I first
discovered femdom,


1588
01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:38.702
basically it was--
it was a gradual shift


1589
01:09:38.737 --> 01:09:40.704
in, like,
how I browsed porn


1590
01:09:40.739 --> 01:09:42.640
and sort of discovered
my sexuality.


1591
01:09:42.675 --> 01:09:44.136
First my mind was blown,
I was like,


1592
01:09:44.171 --> 01:09:46.105
"Wait, like,
the roles could be reversed,


1593
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.844
Like the man can be dominated
in-- in these scenarios?"


1594
01:09:48.879 --> 01:09:51.451
And my first thought was like,
"That's not okay.


1595
01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:54.113
That's not
how like things should work.


1596
01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:57.017
Uh, I want to grow up
to be this, like, tough,


1597
01:09:57.052 --> 01:09:59.756
strong, like,
dude figure that just, like,


1598
01:09:59.791 --> 01:10:01.857
reams his penis
into everything."


1599
01:10:01.892 --> 01:10:03.793
Uh, uh,
thank you Goddess.


1600
01:10:03.828 --> 01:10:05.861
Delving into that
was cool.


1601
01:10:05.896 --> 01:10:08.567
And then I stumbled on
an instructional video.


1602
01:10:08.602 --> 01:10:10.668
Slow, slow...

1603
01:10:10.703 --> 01:10:12.197
It was, like,
more interactive, I guess.


1604
01:10:12.232 --> 01:10:14.199
It was more stimulating
for my brain.


1605
01:10:14.234 --> 01:10:16.674
I'd be instructed on like,
I guess, how to masturbate,


1606
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:18.511
which I thought
was kind of cool.


1607
01:10:18.546 --> 01:10:20.579
And from there I ended up

1608
01:10:20.614 --> 01:10:23.681
on one of Domina Snow's
hypnosis videos.


1609
01:10:23.716 --> 01:10:24.913
Ten...

1610
01:10:26.015 --> 01:10:27.784
nine...

1611
01:10:27.819 --> 01:10:29.720
And it just ended on,
like, me having to eat my cum


1612
01:10:29.755 --> 01:10:31.216
and it was just like,

1613
01:10:31.251 --> 01:10:32.756
"Wait, what the fuck
is happening here?"


1614
01:10:34.287 --> 01:10:35.990
The crisis that I had
after I discovered


1615
01:10:36.025 --> 01:10:37.860
that I, like,
really enjoyed this content


1616
01:10:37.895 --> 01:10:39.664
and I would watch it
at least once or twice a week,


1617
01:10:39.699 --> 01:10:43.162
was like, how would I ever
find someone in my life


1618
01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:45.131
that would, like,
think that this is, like,


1619
01:10:45.166 --> 01:10:47.034
an okay thing
for me to do?


1620
01:10:47.069 --> 01:10:48.970
Telling friends like,
"Oh, this is what I'm into


1621
01:10:49.005 --> 01:10:51.269
and this is, uh,

1622
01:10:51.304 --> 01:10:53.271
how I express
my sexuality."


1623
01:10:53.306 --> 01:10:55.680
Uh, will I be hooded
for the scene itself?


1624
01:10:55.715 --> 01:10:56.978
-Would you like to be hooded?
-Yeah.


1625
01:10:57.013 --> 01:10:59.013
Okay. Absolutely.

1626
01:10:59.048 --> 01:11:01.048
Just like, I-- it's mostly,
like, family worries like that,


1627
01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:02.654
like, it'll, like,
make it to them somehow,


1628
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:04.282
that it's,
like, obviously me.


1629
01:11:04.317 --> 01:11:06.691
I was doing,
like, my usual, like,


1630
01:11:06.726 --> 01:11:08.528
Saturday night after-party,

1631
01:11:08.563 --> 01:11:11.223
like, popping on my, like,

1632
01:11:11.258 --> 01:11:13.632
specific Domina Snow Twitter

1633
01:11:13.667 --> 01:11:15.227
and just
scrolling through it.


1634
01:11:15.262 --> 01:11:16.998
And I saw the blog post,
like, "Hey, if you're in LA


1635
01:11:17.033 --> 01:11:18.835
or San Diego,
we're doing shoots.


1636
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.740
Uh, applications for this
wonderful opportunity."


1637
01:11:22.775 --> 01:11:25.006
And I was like,
"Hell fucking, yeah."


1638
01:11:25.041 --> 01:11:28.911
Like I get to meet
my favorite dominatrix,


1639
01:11:28.946 --> 01:11:30.781
I get to shoot with her.

1640
01:11:30.816 --> 01:11:33.212
There was no, like,
real second thoughts at first,


1641
01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:35.687
but when she responded
to me affirmative,


1642
01:11:35.722 --> 01:11:37.986
I'm like, "Wow, this is--
this is really happening."


1643
01:11:38.021 --> 01:11:39.658
Tell me when you're ready.

1644
01:11:39.693 --> 01:11:42.122
I'm both extremely excited

1645
01:11:42.157 --> 01:11:44.564
with a tad of, like,

1646
01:11:44.599 --> 01:11:46.225
just extreme, like,

1647
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.765
butterflies in my stomach.

1648
01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.327
I'm-
- I'm very like, nervous.

1649
01:11:49.362 --> 01:11:54.904
♪

1650
01:11:56.204 --> 01:11:58.072
You gonna be good for me?

1651
01:11:58.107 --> 01:11:59.271
-Yes, Goddess.
-Yeah?


1652
01:11:59.973 --> 01:12:01.845
You wanna
make sure that you'll...


1653
01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:04.716
obey every command?

1654
01:12:04.751 --> 01:12:06.245
Yes, Goddess.

1655
01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:11.349
And Domina Snow's content,

1656
01:12:11.384 --> 01:12:14.154
it really feels like
it's really been practiced


1657
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:17.762
and there's been like research
into how the psyche works


1658
01:12:17.797 --> 01:12:20.325
and how certain triggers

1659
01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.162
are used in sexuality.

1660
01:12:22.197 --> 01:12:24.769
And I would say
it feels like there's intention


1661
01:12:24.804 --> 01:12:25.902
in like every shot.

1662
01:12:25.937 --> 01:12:26.969
It-- it just feels like...

1663
01:12:28.137 --> 01:12:29.906
-high quality content.

1664
01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:31.611
Good boy.
Like you kept your arms there.


1665
01:12:31.646 --> 01:12:33.910
Oh, I'm so impressed.
Scoot over here.


1666
01:12:33.945 --> 01:12:35.912
They come in
and have this,


1667
01:12:35.947 --> 01:12:37.815
kind of, like,
they put me on a pedestal


1668
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:39.784
and I'm larger than life
and I wanna live up to that.


1669
01:12:39.819 --> 01:12:41.654
But I also wanna
live up to that in a way


1670
01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:43.348
that shows them
that I'm a real person


1671
01:12:43.383 --> 01:12:45.625
and I care about them,
not just I'm this fantasy


1672
01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:47.726
that they've,
you know, kind of concocted.


1673
01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:49.288
So do you have
any ideas for things


1674
01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:50.828
that you really like to--
like to do or try?


1675
01:12:50.863 --> 01:12:52.830
I wanna
try some CBT,


1676
01:12:52.865 --> 01:12:54.029
definitely want
to do that.


1677
01:12:54.664 --> 01:12:56.735
So CBT stands for
cock and ball torture


1678
01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:58.099
or cock and ball torment.

1679
01:12:58.134 --> 01:13:00.101
So these are
instructional videos


1680
01:13:00.136 --> 01:13:03.203
often along-- like,
masturbation instructions too,


1681
01:13:03.238 --> 01:13:05.073
where I have them
assemble things


1682
01:13:05.108 --> 01:13:06.976
from around the home and then
instruct them on how to do it.


1683
01:13:07.011 --> 01:13:08.780
Sometimes,
I'll even have like a dildo


1684
01:13:08.815 --> 01:13:10.177
that has like balls on it
and like "here's how


1685
01:13:10.212 --> 01:13:11.750
you wrap this,
and do this thing,"


1686
01:13:11.785 --> 01:13:13.279
and I kind of help them
to lead along with it.


1687
01:13:14.282 --> 01:13:15.655
What do we have in here?

1688
01:13:19.056 --> 01:13:20.957
So have you done,
like, self-bondage?


1689
01:13:20.992 --> 01:13:22.354
So, like, cock-ball-bondage?

1690
01:13:22.389 --> 01:13:24.323
How do you--
how do you fare there?


1691
01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:26.325
I-- I was trying it again,
like, last night before this.


1692
01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.899
Stick your tongue out.
Let's see.


1693
01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.068
Oh yeah.

1694
01:13:33.103 --> 01:13:36.071
I've like been able to
tie the entire thing up.


1695
01:13:36.106 --> 01:13:38.403
I've done the rubber band one,
where, like,


1696
01:13:38.438 --> 01:13:40.680
you're basically, like,
your cock is just encased


1697
01:13:40.715 --> 01:13:41.780
in like rubber bands.

1698
01:13:41.815 --> 01:13:43.276
That was pretty intense.

1699
01:13:43.311 --> 01:13:44.882
I've gotten to, like,

1700
01:13:44.917 --> 01:13:47.049
maybe seven close pins
on my balls.


1701
01:13:47.084 --> 01:13:48.688
It's a pretty good number.

1702
01:13:48.723 --> 01:13:49.920
There's not
a lot of room there.


1703
01:13:50.355 --> 01:13:52.120
You say
you got to seven before?


1704
01:13:52.155 --> 01:13:53.858
Yes, Goddess.

1705
01:13:53.893 --> 01:13:55.156
Oh good,
''cause we're getting to eight.


1706
01:13:56.058 --> 01:13:59.028
-Thank you, Goddess.
-Yeah. There we go.


1707
01:13:59.063 --> 01:14:01.360
Although, um, I'm--

1708
01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.296
this is all gonna be
authentic and real, um,


1709
01:14:03.331 --> 01:14:05.771
because I don't have
a history of playing with you,


1710
01:14:05.806 --> 01:14:09.137
I'm gonna probably
increase the severity as we go.


1711
01:14:09.172 --> 01:14:10.468
And so it's gonna be
really important


1712
01:14:10.503 --> 01:14:12.305
that you
communicate with me.


1713
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.109
It's better that you
communicate with me


1714
01:14:14.144 --> 01:14:16.012
even if you feel like
it's gonna somehow


1715
01:14:16.047 --> 01:14:18.047
screw up
the video rather than--


1716
01:14:18.082 --> 01:14:20.148
than just, like,
hold it and take it.


1717
01:14:20.183 --> 01:14:22.084
The thing that I really
don't wanna happen is like,


1718
01:14:22.119 --> 01:14:24.757
don't do the typical,
like, guy thing of, like,


1719
01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:26.759
"Oh, I'm just gonna take
whatever you have


1720
01:14:26.794 --> 01:14:28.189
and I'm gonna be stoic and--
and-- and non-responsive."


1721
01:14:28.224 --> 01:14:29.828
Like,
the more responsive you are,


1722
01:14:29.863 --> 01:14:31.126
the better
I'm able to reach you.


1723
01:14:31.161 --> 01:14:32.864
-Mm-hmm.
-There we go.


1724
01:14:36.903 --> 01:14:38.232
I'm like a cat.

1725
01:14:38.267 --> 01:14:40.003
If-- if it
doesn't make noise


1726
01:14:40.038 --> 01:14:41.499
then I'm just
not very interested in it.


1727
01:14:44.405 --> 01:14:46.009
Some of the slave content
was a little hard


1728
01:14:46.044 --> 01:14:48.011
for me to edit at first,

1729
01:14:48.046 --> 01:14:49.881
um, because I'm kind of an--
like an empathetic person,


1730
01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:52.213
so it's like, "Oh, uh, uh,"
you know?


1731
01:14:52.248 --> 01:14:54.050
But eventually,
like you kinda get over it.


1732
01:14:54.085 --> 01:14:56.052
And especially
talking to these guys


1733
01:14:56.087 --> 01:14:57.482
after they do sessions
like that and they're like,


1734
01:14:57.517 --> 01:14:59.385
"Man, that was great!

1735
01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:01.288
That was something
I totally wasn't expecting."


1736
01:15:01.323 --> 01:15:03.796
Or like, they've got
this sort of high afterwards


1737
01:15:03.831 --> 01:15:05.765
and that's what they look for
in that fetish.


1738
01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.932
So, I know that this is what
these guys are looking for,


1739
01:15:07.967 --> 01:15:09.868
so I don't feel bad
editing it anymore.


1740
01:15:11.069 --> 01:15:12.431
He did such a great job.

1741
01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:14.334
He-- he really
did a great job.


1742
01:15:14.369 --> 01:15:16.072
And then he was young
and he was a college student,


1743
01:15:16.107 --> 01:15:18.437
and either
they're like super gung ho


1744
01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:20.142
and like really,
really into it


1745
01:15:20.177 --> 01:15:21.781
or they're
absolutely terrified,


1746
01:15:21.816 --> 01:15:23.343
have no experience whatsoever.

1747
01:15:23.378 --> 01:15:25.015
And I was really excited
when he arrived that


1748
01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:26.379
it seemed to be the former.

1749
01:15:27.547 --> 01:15:30.383
Cut. Good job.

1750
01:15:30.418 --> 01:15:31.516
How're you feeling?

1751
01:15:32.352 --> 01:15:34.123
-How're you doing?
-All right.


1752
01:15:34.158 --> 01:15:35.388
Good.

1753
01:15:35.423 --> 01:15:37.093
Wow.
That was an experience.


1754
01:15:37.524 --> 01:15:39.095
I am so happy

1755
01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:41.427
and when
I go on with my day


1756
01:15:41.462 --> 01:15:45.266
and, uh,
I feel glowing, basically.


1757
01:15:45.301 --> 01:15:47.268
One of the many
considerations that I have,


1758
01:15:47.303 --> 01:15:49.171
like, going through my studies

1759
01:15:49.206 --> 01:15:51.107
and, like,
looking at my future careers,


1760
01:15:51.142 --> 01:15:53.472
uh, outside of, like,

1761
01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:56.079
food, housing,
a happy family,


1762
01:15:56.114 --> 01:15:58.917
is like being able
to afford to visit


1763
01:15:58.952 --> 01:16:00.281
a professional dominatrix

1764
01:16:00.316 --> 01:16:02.822
and have experiences
like these.


1765
01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:09.554
♪

1766
01:16:13.494 --> 01:16:14.559
Oh...

1767
01:16:17.234 --> 01:16:19.168
do I love...

1768
01:16:20.402 --> 01:16:22.039
being a man eater?

1769
01:16:22.074 --> 01:16:25.339
You wanna take
a big cock like this


1770
01:16:25.374 --> 01:16:27.880
because I told you to?

1771
01:16:27.915 --> 01:16:30.509
It just turns me on
so much


1772
01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.181
to think of you
with another guy.


1773
01:16:33.217 --> 01:16:35.382
You know,
come to think of it,


1774
01:16:35.417 --> 01:16:39.056
maybe you should
get on Grindr right now.


1775
01:16:39.091 --> 01:16:41.553
I can tell
after opening my stores


1776
01:16:41.588 --> 01:16:43.995
I was-
- I was able to upload

1777
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:46.866
a clip every single day
for about two weeks.


1778
01:16:46.901 --> 01:16:49.033
I noticed that, you know,
if I were to upload


1779
01:16:49.068 --> 01:16:51.233
every single day,
five or six days a week,


1780
01:16:51.268 --> 01:16:52.498
I'm gonna do great.

1781
01:16:52.533 --> 01:16:54.236
I can see that
in my sales


1782
01:16:54.271 --> 01:16:56.238
and, you know, it shows me
all these graphs


1783
01:16:56.273 --> 01:16:59.010
and it helps things
make sense to me.


1784
01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.981
Have you ever been
to a Bikini Barista before?


1785
01:17:04.281 --> 01:17:05.346
No?

1786
01:17:07.482 --> 01:17:09.416
Well, they're one of my
favorite places


1787
01:17:09.451 --> 01:17:11.583
to go get coffee.

1788
01:17:11.618 --> 01:17:13.255
I mean,
why wouldn't you wanna


1789
01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:14.993
-come get coffee from me?

1790
01:17:15.028 --> 01:17:16.159
So tell me how it's going.

1791
01:17:16.194 --> 01:17:18.524
Um, let's see.

1792
01:17:18.559 --> 01:17:21.263
I actually haven't filmed
in a couple weeks.


1793
01:17:21.298 --> 01:17:23.595
I did go to Portland
and I filmed


1794
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:25.201
-Okay.
-With somebody down there.


1795
01:17:25.236 --> 01:17:26.532
I know I'll do--
I'll do well


1796
01:17:26.567 --> 01:17:28.666
as long as
I fully dedicate myself,


1797
01:17:28.701 --> 01:17:32.241
and I can't even
dedicate myself halfway


1798
01:17:32.276 --> 01:17:35.508
when I'm spending four days
a week working coffee.


1799
01:17:35.543 --> 01:17:38.577
I'm-- I'm just a little nervous
about leaving a job.


1800
01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:41.921
Like, you know, being--
I'm going to do it.


1801
01:17:41.956 --> 01:17:43.989
I just--
it's a little scary.


1802
01:17:44.024 --> 01:17:45.287
Well, of course
it's scary, but this--


1803
01:17:45.322 --> 01:17:46.992
but you already have a job,

1804
01:17:47.027 --> 01:17:48.323
this is just
investing more time in a job


1805
01:17:48.358 --> 01:17:49.929
that you own...

1806
01:17:49.964 --> 01:17:51.997
-Yeah.
-...versus, you know,


1807
01:17:52.032 --> 01:17:53.493
a job that somebody else owns
and you're working for them.


1808
01:17:53.528 --> 01:17:55.495
If it was me, I could--
I could do both jobs...


1809
01:17:56.498 --> 01:17:58.597
but I don't know
the me at 22


1810
01:17:58.632 --> 01:18:00.203
could have done both jobs.

1811
01:18:00.238 --> 01:18:01.337
She's proud of me,
she tells me


1812
01:18:01.373 --> 01:18:03.239
she's proud of me all the time,
which helps me a lot


1813
01:18:03.274 --> 01:18:05.175
and makes me feel good

1814
01:18:05.210 --> 01:18:06.704
and I appreciate that.

1815
01:18:06.739 --> 01:18:08.376
That's pretty much
all I really need,


1816
01:18:08.411 --> 01:18:10.609
is to, you know,
keep getting encouragement


1817
01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:12.479
from the people I'm close to.

1818
01:18:12.514 --> 01:18:14.283
I did notice your--
like your staging looks better


1819
01:18:14.318 --> 01:18:16.219
and, you know,
like the stuff you shot,


1820
01:18:16.254 --> 01:18:18.254
uh, in,
a nice hotel room.


1821
01:18:18.289 --> 01:18:20.718
I still don't know if
I'm going to be strictly dom,


1822
01:18:20.753 --> 01:18:22.687
so we will--
you know, I-- I don't know--


1823
01:18:22.722 --> 01:18:24.293
I don't know
what I'm gonna look like.


1824
01:18:24.328 --> 01:18:25.998
Sure.

1825
01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:27.626
And the great thing is--
is that you can grow


1826
01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:29.364
-and evolve and change.
-Yeah.


1827
01:18:29.399 --> 01:18:30.530
-Like, no one's gonna stop you.
-Yeah.


1828
01:18:32.204 --> 01:18:35.436
I hope
to have empowered


1829
01:18:35.471 --> 01:18:38.670
an entire
generation of women...


1830
01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.641
who choose sex work

1831
01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:44.511
because it's
the vocation they want,


1832
01:18:44.546 --> 01:18:46.447
not because
they felt like they had


1833
01:18:46.482 --> 01:18:48.119
no other options in life.

1834
01:18:48.154 --> 01:18:49.582
That's what
I really wanna see.


1835
01:18:49.617 --> 01:18:51.485
Certainly that's
probably the reason


1836
01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.289
that I'm training Raevyn
the way that I am, right?


1837
01:18:53.324 --> 01:18:55.753
Like-- like I wanna see her
take on the mantle


1838
01:18:55.788 --> 01:18:57.755
and be
the next generation


1839
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:59.493
and then
I wanna see her


1840
01:18:59.528 --> 01:19:01.693
do what I'm doing
and train someone else.


1841
01:19:01.728 --> 01:19:03.398
Nip slip!

1842
01:19:04.467 --> 01:19:08.271
We rented
the Stimson-Green Mansion


1843
01:19:08.306 --> 01:19:10.075
and we did photo shoots.

1844
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:11.472
-I like that.
-Yeah, yeah.


1845
01:19:11.507 --> 01:19:13.210
We had Sarah Skinner

1846
01:19:13.245 --> 01:19:14.607
as the photographer,

1847
01:19:14.642 --> 01:19:17.346
who is
an amazingly talented artist


1848
01:19:17.381 --> 01:19:19.579
and also really hardcore.

1849
01:19:19.614 --> 01:19:21.119
She's just
really, really intense.


1850
01:19:23.255 --> 01:19:28.291
♪

1851
01:19:28.326 --> 01:19:30.128
Honestly,
she was the right person


1852
01:19:30.163 --> 01:19:32.031
to wrangle all these doms
''cause, you know,


1853
01:19:32.066 --> 01:19:33.692
she's like, "All the things
you think you know,


1854
01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:35.694
we're not doing
any of them.


1855
01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.399
You know, we're gonna make
really different things."


1856
01:19:37.434 --> 01:19:39.335
I think
this industry is incredible.


1857
01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:42.173
The women and men involved
that I have been exposed to


1858
01:19:42.208 --> 01:19:44.472
and-- and have actually
become friends with


1859
01:19:44.507 --> 01:19:47.541
are an incredibly diverse

1860
01:19:47.576 --> 01:19:49.510
cast of people.

1861
01:19:49.545 --> 01:19:52.084
They're all incredibly
well-spoken and intelligent.


1862
01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:53.580
Um, they're very well read.

1863
01:19:53.615 --> 01:19:55.054
It's kind of
a breath of fresh air


1864
01:19:55.089 --> 01:19:56.583
because they're all kind of

1865
01:19:56.618 --> 01:19:58.387
taking the world
at their own pace.


1866
01:19:58.422 --> 01:20:00.092
They're doing
what they want in the world.


1867
01:20:00.127 --> 01:20:01.753
They're shaping their life

1868
01:20:01.788 --> 01:20:03.755
to be exactly
what they want it to be.


1869
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.465
And that's-- that's
it, girl, come on.


1870
01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.468
I grew up
with very bad skin


1871
01:20:13.503 --> 01:20:16.207
and very flamboyant
fashion sense.


1872
01:20:16.242 --> 01:20:18.308
So I was known
as the weirdo.


1873
01:20:18.343 --> 01:20:19.771
I didn't know
where I belonged,


1874
01:20:19.806 --> 01:20:21.542
didn't have
a lot of friends.


1875
01:20:21.577 --> 01:20:22.774
I don't feel
like you need these.


1876
01:20:26.615 --> 01:20:28.780
And then
I find out everybody loves


1877
01:20:28.815 --> 01:20:32.520
that I'm weird,
and that I open my big mouth


1878
01:20:32.555 --> 01:20:35.391
or I stand up
for people or whatever.


1879
01:20:35.426 --> 01:20:37.492
This industry
is a really good reminder that,


1880
01:20:37.527 --> 01:20:39.824
"No, we like you
''cause you're you."


1881
01:20:39.859 --> 01:20:41.496
That's the best.

1882
01:20:41.531 --> 01:20:43.696
-Yeah, come on. Come on!

1883
01:20:45.205 --> 01:20:47.172
<i>Because of the way</i>

1884
01:20:47.207 --> 01:20:49.702
<i>this society</i>
<i>is organized</i>


1885
01:20:49.737 --> 01:20:51.242
<i>because</i>
<i>of the</i> .


1886
01:20:51.277 --> 01:20:52.705
Bring your head--

1887
01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:55.114
I want you to look at her.
Look at her.


1888
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:56.511
It's a labor of love,

1889
01:20:56.546 --> 01:20:58.744
being able to serve
amazing women,


1890
01:20:58.779 --> 01:21:01.516
being able to play a part
in amazing things


1891
01:21:01.551 --> 01:21:03.155
such as this event

1892
01:21:03.190 --> 01:21:05.223
and hopefully make--
make them happy.


1893
01:21:05.258 --> 01:21:08.589
Real fucking hot and um--

1894
01:21:08.624 --> 01:21:10.855
I feel like this is, like,
a-- a Dolce and Gabbana.


1895
01:21:12.463 --> 01:21:14.661
You know,
this is about enjoying


1896
01:21:14.696 --> 01:21:16.894
what you enjoy and turning
that


1897
01:21:16.929 --> 01:21:18.698
into good work and--

1898
01:21:18.733 --> 01:21:21.701
and just making everything
nice for everybody else.


1899
01:21:21.736 --> 01:21:22.867
Yeah, good job guys.

1900
01:21:22.902 --> 01:21:24.242
-Whoo!

1901
01:21:34.914 --> 01:21:36.683
It's a group of strong

1902
01:21:36.718 --> 01:21:39.521
independent women
who are kinky


1903
01:21:39.556 --> 01:21:42.524
and very liberated
and free spirited


1904
01:21:42.559 --> 01:21:45.593
at the same time,
and it's a good mix.


1905
01:21:46.959 --> 01:21:48.662
-Thank you.
-Thanks.


1906
01:21:49.231 --> 01:21:50.664
We''re in a really unique,

1907
01:21:50.699 --> 01:21:52.798
weird industry
and I think that


1908
01:21:52.833 --> 01:21:55.537
if you don't have
friendships within it,


1909
01:21:55.572 --> 01:21:56.934
you're gonna go
fucking crazy.


1910
01:21:56.969 --> 01:21:58.408
It could be really,
really lonely.


1911
01:21:58.443 --> 01:21:59.871
The umbrellas?

1912
01:21:59.906 --> 01:22:01.510
I was going to get food.

1913
01:22:01.545 --> 01:22:03.776
I'm very thankful
that I do have


1914
01:22:03.811 --> 01:22:06.284
these women that even if
we don't see each other,


1915
01:22:06.319 --> 01:22:08.253
but once a year,
I can still message them.


1916
01:22:08.288 --> 01:22:10.684
Or when I see them, it feels
like no time has passed


1917
01:22:10.719 --> 01:22:13.753
and we have this connection
and they advise me on things.


1918
01:22:13.788 --> 01:22:16.525
And I value
their opinion on everything


1919
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.428
''cause they
understand completely what--


1920
01:22:18.463 --> 01:22:19.759
what we're all
going through.


1921
01:22:22.065 --> 01:22:23.829
Get ready for
the internet to hate you guys.


1922
01:22:23.864 --> 01:22:27.206
.

1923
01:22:27.241 --> 01:22:28.636
I believe
when the majority of the people


1924
01:22:28.671 --> 01:22:32.442
in the industry
have passionately,


1925
01:22:32.477 --> 01:22:35.544
you know, confidently
chosen what they do,


1926
01:22:35.579 --> 01:22:37.843
then the landscape
of that industry


1927
01:22:37.878 --> 01:22:39.614
changes radically.

1928
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:40.879
And...

1929
01:22:41.681 --> 01:22:44.322
that's what I really--
I really hope to see.


1930
01:22:44.357 --> 01:22:46.258
I don't want you guys
holding your backs.


1931
01:22:46.293 --> 01:22:47.688
You know,
at the end of the day,


1932
01:22:47.723 --> 01:22:49.756
we're people
like anyone else.


1933
01:22:49.791 --> 01:22:51.824
So, you know,
most of the women


1934
01:22:51.859 --> 01:22:53.628
are really cool,
down to earth


1935
01:22:53.663 --> 01:22:55.960
and just
rad human beings.


1936
01:22:55.995 --> 01:22:57.929
I mean, that's the least
I could say about Alex.


1937
01:22:57.964 --> 01:23:00.239
Alex is fucking awesome
in-- in so many ways.


1938
01:23:03.343 --> 01:23:05.442
-No rules!

1939
01:23:05.477 --> 01:23:06.839
No-- no rules?

1940
01:23:06.874 --> 01:23:07.906
No,
that means you say it.


1941
01:23:09.547 --> 01:23:10.942
I love
the women in this community.


1942
01:23:10.977 --> 01:23:13.252
They have made me
feel so accepted


1943
01:23:13.287 --> 01:23:16.717
and so loved
just because they see in me


1944
01:23:16.752 --> 01:23:18.917
the same kind of qualities
that drive them


1945
01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:20.787
as like business women,

1946
01:23:20.822 --> 01:23:23.427
and they've really
accepted me into the group


1947
01:23:23.462 --> 01:23:25.297
and I love them a lot.

1948
01:23:25.332 --> 01:23:26.397
They talk about being goddesses
''cause they are.


1949
01:23:26.432 --> 01:23:27.299
They're powerful women.

1950
01:23:35.936 --> 01:23:37.606
I have such

1951
01:23:37.641 --> 01:23:39.641
an incredible
sense of belonging.


1952
01:23:39.676 --> 01:23:41.280
I've never
had that before.


1953
01:23:41.315 --> 01:23:43.040
You know,
I've never had a group


1954
01:23:43.075 --> 01:23:45.812
that I fit in with
and I've never had my people,


1955
01:23:45.847 --> 01:23:48.045
and-- and these are my people.

1956
01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.884
I have the best
support system imaginable


1957
01:23:51.919 --> 01:23:53.556
and all of--

1958
01:23:53.591 --> 01:23:55.624
all of these people
are really close.


1959
01:23:55.659 --> 01:23:57.329
You know,
it's not just, like,


1960
01:23:57.364 --> 01:23:58.924
they're friends on-- online

1961
01:23:58.959 --> 01:24:02.433
or they're friends
for-- for the photos.


1962
01:24:02.468 --> 01:24:03.797
You know,
we all have


1963
01:24:03.832 --> 01:24:05.601
really strong
close connections.


1964
01:24:07.902 --> 01:24:09.638
The only people that do lobby

1965
01:24:09.673 --> 01:24:11.904
for sex work--
sex worker rights


1966
01:24:11.939 --> 01:24:13.642
tend to be
other sex workers.


1967
01:24:13.677 --> 01:24:16.040
And it's too easy
to label us


1968
01:24:16.075 --> 01:24:18.042
as being
the undesirables of, you know,


1969
01:24:18.077 --> 01:24:20.550
of-- of society,
and therefore our voices


1970
01:24:20.585 --> 01:24:21.815
don't make a difference.

1971
01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.464
The thing I had wanted to do

1972
01:24:33.499 --> 01:24:35.433
for some time was
I wanted to build


1973
01:24:35.468 --> 01:24:36.995
a-- an independent
collective model--


1974
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:38.700
business collective model
in which that


1975
01:24:38.735 --> 01:24:41.472
all of the--
the people inside that


1976
01:24:41.507 --> 01:24:42.968
as-- as sex workers

1977
01:24:43.003 --> 01:24:45.542
were all their own
individual businesses


1978
01:24:45.577 --> 01:24:46.873
and that they got to

1979
01:24:46.908 --> 01:24:48.743
make the decisions
for themselves.


1980
01:24:48.778 --> 01:24:50.778
When Alex was, like,

1981
01:24:50.813 --> 01:24:52.450
in the final stages
of her divorce,


1982
01:24:52.485 --> 01:24:54.980
like we had--
we had summoned him


1983
01:24:55.015 --> 01:24:56.850
to court many times.

1984
01:24:56.885 --> 01:24:59.391
He didn't show up
and so finally the judge was


1985
01:24:59.426 --> 01:25:01.888
just like, "All right,
Alex, you're divorced."


1986
01:25:01.923 --> 01:25:03.890
"You get all the stuff
that you want in the divorce


1987
01:25:03.925 --> 01:25:05.331
because Joseph
never showed up."


1988
01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:08.994
In the process
of leaving Wicked Eden


1989
01:25:09.029 --> 01:25:12.030
in the place
that it was before with Joseph,


1990
01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:13.933
we started
The Wicked Collective together.


1991
01:25:13.968 --> 01:25:16.573
Um, both her and I
are equal share owners


1992
01:25:16.608 --> 01:25:18.377
in the Wicked Collective

1993
01:25:18.412 --> 01:25:20.511
and I am the director
of operations there.


1994
01:25:20.546 --> 01:25:22.744
I think the collective
will continue to grow.


1995
01:25:22.779 --> 01:25:25.945
Uh, I'm excited
to teach other girls


1996
01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:27.782
the things that I know
and the things


1997
01:25:27.817 --> 01:25:30.114
that I've learned
through my experiences.


1998
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:33.821
We just had to dismiss
one of our sad little slaves.


1999
01:25:33.856 --> 01:25:35.724
-Mm. Yeah.
-Didn't we?


2000
01:25:35.759 --> 01:25:37.121
I'm excited

2001
01:25:37.156 --> 01:25:40.498
to grow my business
in production.


2002
01:25:40.533 --> 01:25:43.468
I hope the people
watching this documentary


2003
01:25:43.503 --> 01:25:44.964
are inspired
to go home


2004
01:25:44.999 --> 01:25:47.868
and do some
kinky dirty shit.


2005
01:25:47.903 --> 01:25:49.903
It will be
a different dungeon,


2006
01:25:49.938 --> 01:25:52.642
uh, when we buy
our new place,


2007
01:25:52.677 --> 01:25:54.809
um, but the collective will--

2008
01:25:54.844 --> 01:25:57.141
will persist
no matter what


2009
01:25:57.176 --> 01:25:58.879
Wicked Eden ever looks like.

2010
01:25:58.914 --> 01:26:00.848
Wicked Collective
will always be the group


2011
01:26:00.883 --> 01:26:03.147
that, um, is--
it is formed around it


2012
01:26:03.182 --> 01:26:05.589
and empowers
and upholds each other.


2013
01:26:07.461 --> 01:26:08.955
Since starting the documentary,
one of the things


2014
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:11.661
that I promised myself
was that I would stop--


2015
01:26:11.696 --> 01:26:14.862
I would stop lying to people,
um, that I didn't know well.


2016
01:26:14.897 --> 01:26:16.963
You know, like when--
you know, like you--


2017
01:26:16.998 --> 01:26:18.668
there's lots of people that
you're gonna be faced with,


2018
01:26:18.703 --> 01:26:20.538
that, um, that, like,
you know, ask you,


2019
01:26:20.573 --> 01:26:22.199
"Well what do you do
for a living?" sort of thing.


2020
01:26:22.234 --> 01:26:25.510
And I always gave them a very,
like, acceptable answer.


2021
01:26:25.545 --> 01:26:27.171
You know, "I work
in a production company,"


2022
01:26:27.206 --> 01:26:29.514
or you know, like, whatever,
"I do life coaching,


2023
01:26:29.549 --> 01:26:30.944
you know,
I breed cats."


2024
01:26:30.979 --> 01:26:32.946
Um, and I just stopped.

2025
01:26:32.981 --> 01:26:35.652
I like just stopped trying
to protect people's feelings


2026
01:26:35.687 --> 01:26:36.983
and just be authentic.

2027
01:26:37.018 --> 01:26:38.919
And I thought,
I'm gonna deal--


2028
01:26:38.954 --> 01:26:40.789
I'm gonna be dealing
with a lot of shit this year.


2029
01:26:40.824 --> 01:26:42.186
I'm just gonna deal
with a lot of people's--


2030
01:26:42.221 --> 01:26:43.858
a lot of stigma
and their stereotypes


2031
01:26:43.893 --> 01:26:45.596
and everything else,
but you know what?


2032
01:26:45.631 --> 01:26:46.894
I've really encountered
very little of it.


2033
01:26:46.929 --> 01:26:49.094
I've encountered
so much support


2034
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:50.865
and acceptance
and people being, like,


2035
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:53.032
"That's amazing.
I have some questions for you."


2036
01:26:53.067 --> 01:26:54.638
And, like,
and then calling me


2037
01:26:54.673 --> 01:26:56.002
and asking me
things about their lives


2038
01:26:56.037 --> 01:26:57.036
and, like,
their kinks, and like,


2039
01:26:57.071 --> 01:26:58.708
it just felt so good

2040
01:26:58.743 --> 01:27:01.546
to just be able
to just be you, you know?


2041
01:27:01.581 --> 01:27:02.910
So I'm--
I'm glad you're doing it.


2042
01:27:02.945 --> 01:27:04.549
Yeah.

2043
01:27:05.184 --> 01:27:08.179
Doing this basically means
that I'm gonna have to be


2044
01:27:08.214 --> 01:27:10.654
somewhat public
about how I feel about this.


2045
01:27:10.689 --> 01:27:13.052
Like my best friends
and roommates need to know


2046
01:27:13.087 --> 01:27:15.527
about this at the very least,
I can't just


2047
01:27:15.562 --> 01:27:17.595
keep up this facade
about like who I am


2048
01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:20.499
and how I enjoy
my sexuality and pleasure.


2049
01:27:21.168 --> 01:27:22.897
Look at your face.

2050
01:27:22.932 --> 01:27:24.228
It makes such a good
foot stool, doesn't it?


2051
01:27:24.263 --> 01:27:26.098
Wearing a mask
is uncomfortable


2052
01:27:26.133 --> 01:27:29.101
and it was probably,
um, obscuring his ability


2053
01:27:29.136 --> 01:27:31.037
to like, to see me
and, like, interact with me


2054
01:27:31.072 --> 01:27:33.710
in a way that felt--
like, felt more-- more natural.


2055
01:27:33.745 --> 01:27:36.009
He just said, "I'd preferred
to-- to do it with it off,"


2056
01:27:36.044 --> 01:27:38.517
and, uh, and I said--

2057
01:27:38.552 --> 01:27:40.145
I said, "Is it just
uncomfortable?" and he goes,


2058
01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.652
"I just feel like
I don't need it."


2059
01:27:43.183 --> 01:27:45.656
And we had also just
kind of had a conversation


2060
01:27:45.691 --> 01:27:47.757
about the fact that,
you know, um,


2061
01:27:47.792 --> 01:27:49.253
I was kinda
coming out with my identity


2062
01:27:49.288 --> 01:27:51.222
as part of--
as part of the documentary,


2063
01:27:51.257 --> 01:27:53.191
and I feel like that may have
inspired him a little bit


2064
01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:55.292
to feel like, "Hey,
if you're doing it, I can too.


2065
01:27:55.327 --> 01:27:57.162
I can-- You know,
if your face is on this thing,


2066
01:27:57.197 --> 01:27:58.735
I can do it as well."

2067
01:27:58.770 --> 01:28:00.099
I wish
our society at large


2068
01:28:00.134 --> 01:28:01.540
was more comfortable
being honest


2069
01:28:01.575 --> 01:28:02.805
about their
sexual desires.


2070
01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.972
America's porn watching habits

2071
01:28:05.007 --> 01:28:06.842
or their search history
is it tells


2072
01:28:06.877 --> 01:28:08.811
a totally different
story from what we would show


2073
01:28:08.846 --> 01:28:11.110
to our friends
or show to our partners.


2074
01:28:11.145 --> 01:28:12.584
.

2075
01:28:12.619 --> 01:28:14.146
Thank you, Goddess.

2076
01:28:16.249 --> 01:28:21.285
♪

2077
01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.694
I really think
if we''re gonna move


2078
01:28:23.729 --> 01:28:25.894
America forward
to be more sex positive,


2079
01:28:25.929 --> 01:28:27.797
then what
we need to do is, one,


2080
01:28:27.832 --> 01:28:30.294
integrate this
into our education system.


2081
01:28:30.329 --> 01:28:34.100
We need
a comprehensive sex ED system


2082
01:28:34.135 --> 01:28:36.872
that goes
K-12 and beyond


2083
01:28:36.907 --> 01:28:39.974
and really talks
about just consent


2084
01:28:40.009 --> 01:28:42.746
and communication
and, you know,


2085
01:28:42.781 --> 01:28:44.814
ownership of our own bodies
and our own selves


2086
01:28:44.849 --> 01:28:48.048
and gives us agency
to say yes or no.


2087
01:28:48.083 --> 01:28:50.149
-Happy Pride!
-Happy Pride!


2088
01:28:50.184 --> 01:28:52.723
-Mwah!

2089
01:28:52.758 --> 01:28:54.351
I want people who are

2090
01:28:54.386 --> 01:28:55.825
thinking about
getting into sex work


2091
01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:57.596
or early into sex work,

2092
01:28:57.631 --> 01:28:59.323
to know that there are
other people out here


2093
01:28:59.358 --> 01:29:01.831
doing this thing
and in groups.


2094
01:29:01.866 --> 01:29:03.668
You don't
have to be alone.


2095
01:29:03.703 --> 01:29:05.604
Uh, you don't have to
do it all on your own.


2096
01:29:05.639 --> 01:29:08.200
And uh, there--
there's a safe way to do it.


2097
01:29:08.235 --> 01:29:10.741
There's a safe way to do
sex work and-- and it's okay.


2098
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:14.712
I think this country
sees the women in the industry


2099
01:29:14.747 --> 01:29:17.308
as deviants and degenerates,
when they're real people


2100
01:29:17.343 --> 01:29:18.848
doing real jobs.

2101
01:29:18.883 --> 01:29:21.213
And sex workers
are real workers.


2102
01:29:21.248 --> 01:29:22.786
Sex work is real work

2103
01:29:22.821 --> 01:29:24.854
and sex work
should be empowered.


2104
01:29:24.889 --> 01:29:28.627
They shouldn't be
persecuted for what they do.


2105
01:29:28.662 --> 01:29:30.893
And I feel like very soon

2106
01:29:30.928 --> 01:29:33.896
there may be a time

2107
01:29:33.931 --> 01:29:36.800
where the world looks
at sex workers and goes,


2108
01:29:36.835 --> 01:29:38.263
"You know, hey, maybe--

2109
01:29:38.298 --> 01:29:39.671
maybe we've been
wrong this whole time."


2110
01:29:41.367 --> 01:29:42.740
I make a great living

2111
01:29:42.775 --> 01:29:44.335
off of this character,

2112
01:29:44.370 --> 01:29:47.008
this persona who embodies
a lot of my own traits,


2113
01:29:47.043 --> 01:29:48.713
but also,
you know, has to,


2114
01:29:48.748 --> 01:29:50.275
like, make them
larger than life.


2115
01:29:51.817 --> 01:29:53.146
I feel like
the big thing is--


2116
01:29:53.181 --> 01:29:54.411
is that your clients,
your fans,


2117
01:29:54.446 --> 01:29:56.985
they are so--
so convinced


2118
01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:59.086
that your life and your--
and who you are


2119
01:29:59.121 --> 01:30:01.253
needs to be exactly
this fantasy archetype.


2120
01:30:01.288 --> 01:30:04.058
That you are not a real person,
you are a comic book character.


2121
01:30:04.093 --> 01:30:05.895
I love people
who like think that I-- I--


2122
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:07.666
I might wear something
like this around my house.


2123
01:30:07.701 --> 01:30:09.327
I had to bring this,

2124
01:30:09.362 --> 01:30:11.428
I had to bring
all this stuff from my studio,


2125
01:30:11.463 --> 01:30:13.067
bring it here, and this
doesn't even live here.


2126
01:30:13.102 --> 01:30:14.398
None of this stuff
lives here.


2127
01:30:14.433 --> 01:30:15.806
I-
- I don't want it to.

2128
01:30:15.841 --> 01:30:17.434
I want my normal clothes.

2129
01:30:17.469 --> 01:30:20.206
I want my-- my normal life
with sweaters and shit


2130
01:30:20.241 --> 01:30:21.647
to live here.

2131
01:30:23.211 --> 01:30:25.046
See this? This?

2132
01:30:25.851 --> 01:30:26.850
This is amazing.

2133
01:30:28.084 --> 01:30:29.952
This is a dress
made out of unicorns.


2134
01:30:29.987 --> 01:30:31.921
Yep, and I can't wait
to wear this in a picture


2135
01:30:31.956 --> 01:30:33.384
and someone--
and someone say,


2136
01:30:33.419 --> 01:30:35.122
"Oh, but Goddess,
I miss you were in--


2137
01:30:35.157 --> 01:30:36.223
you were wearing latex
and leather and stuff."


2138
01:30:36.258 --> 01:30:38.158
And I'll be like, "Bitch,
I'm in my unicorn dress.


2139
01:30:38.193 --> 01:30:39.423
I look amazing."

2140
01:30:39.825 --> 01:30:42.767
Alex is going to be
coming out with her name


2141
01:30:42.802 --> 01:30:45.297
on the documentary
and that's going to be


2142
01:30:45.332 --> 01:30:47.266
a step
in normalizing sex work,


2143
01:30:47.301 --> 01:30:50.005
so people don't think
that they have to use


2144
01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.239
stage names and they can
use their real name


2145
01:30:53.274 --> 01:30:55.406
because it is a job
and this is something


2146
01:30:55.441 --> 01:30:57.408
that a lot
of people could do.


2147
01:30:58.310 --> 01:31:00.345
Who makes things legitimate?

2148
01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:02.446
It's not some magical,
like, external force,


2149
01:31:02.481 --> 01:31:04.921
it's the people
inside that industry.


2150
01:31:04.956 --> 01:31:06.791
Inside of that field who say,

2151
01:31:06.826 --> 01:31:08.386
"We will legitimize ourselves."

2152
01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:10.190
And the only way
to do that is to present


2153
01:31:10.225 --> 01:31:12.830
to the outside world
that you are worthy of it.


2154
01:31:15.131 --> 01:31:16.801
My name is Jamie,

2155
01:31:16.836 --> 01:31:18.264
but it's still
Goddess to you.
