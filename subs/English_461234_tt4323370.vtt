00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:17.627
Welcome to
the United States of America.


4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.462
We call this
the land of the free,


5
00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:21.298
but this country is home

6
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:24.867
to the largest prison population
in the world.


7
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:27.704
2.2 million Americans.

8
00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:30.940
We put more people in cages
here than China,


9
00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:32.909
Russia, than anywhere.

10
00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:36.313
We have more people in prisons.

11
00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:38.581
More than we have colleges
and universities.


12
00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:42.885
1/3 of all incarcerated
females globally


13
00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:45.322
are locked up here
in the United States.


14
00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:48.958
13 million Americans
are arrested every year.


15
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.961
- Get your hands off the truck!
- I'm not doing anything.


16
00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:54.797
Put that in perspective--
imagine all of Los Angeles


17
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:59.336
and all of New York combined
arrested every year.


18
00:01:01.738 --> 00:01:03.806
There are countless heroes
in law enforcement


19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.842
saving lives every day.

20
00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:08.445
[female reporter]
Able to pull her limp bo--


21
00:01:09.746 --> 00:01:11.881
But not a single state
in our union


22
00:01:11.914 --> 00:01:14.751
- has use-of-force laws...
- I can't breathe!


23
00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:17.987
that meet even the most basic
international standards...


24
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.457
[woman screams]

25
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.893
With record poverty,
drug use,


26
00:01:23.926 --> 00:01:25.928
and countless nonviolent
social issues


27
00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:29.832
left to our police officers
to solve with only three tools,


28
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.868
we have a national crisis
on our hands.


29
00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:33.703
Of course,
we need dangerous people


30
00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:35.638
removed from our communities.

31
00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:40.109
But how many Americans
are really so dangerous...


32
00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:41.978
He's arresting me.

33
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:43.880
that they need to be locked
in a cage?


34
00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:46.949
I enrolled my girls
in my father's school district.


35
00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:50.019
- They sent me to jail.
- [wailing]


36
00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:52.389
They sent my father
to jail, too.


37
00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:53.790
My father never came home.

38
00:01:53.823 --> 00:01:55.725
The law enforcement apparatus

39
00:01:55.758 --> 00:01:58.027
is deployed disproportionately
against people of color.


40
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.463
If you're a black man,
your crack is gonna get


41
00:02:00.497 --> 00:02:02.031
300 times more than your...

42
00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:05.402
We know reform
is desperately needed,


43
00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:07.404
- but how do we reform...
- Can't record inside.


44
00:02:07.437 --> 00:02:09.472
when prisons don't just
lock people up inside?


45
00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:12.008
You don't want to tape me
with your telephone!


46
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:13.843
- Get it all!
- I'm a member of the press.


47
00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:16.078
- They lock us out.
- Pack up and go.


48
00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:18.981
Citizens, the media,
independent journalists


49
00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:22.485
are all routinely barred
from recording or documenting


50
00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.055
anything that's going on inside
our criminal justice system.


51
00:02:26.088 --> 00:02:27.924
You're a chicken shit
motherfu--


52
00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:30.059
We have to get all our
information and impressions


53
00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:32.429
from corporate
commercially funded television.


54
00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:34.731
[man] If you can't do the time,
don't do the cr--


55
00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:35.898
These shows are filmed
and edited


56
00:02:35.932 --> 00:02:37.467
under tight supervision.

57
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.035
They're not going
to prepare you


58
00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:41.604
for the inhuman conditions,
the violence


59
00:02:41.638 --> 00:02:44.073
and brutality
you're going to have to face.


60
00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:46.643
You think because
you obey the law,


61
00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:48.010
you have nothing
to worry about.


62
00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:49.579
[Matthew] But recently,

63
00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:51.147
the Wall Street Journal
suggests


64
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.082
we now have so many laws
on the books,


65
00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:55.618
the average American
commits three felonies a day


66
00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:57.787
- without even knowing it.
- He didn't do anything!


67
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.823
As an American, you're more
likely to go to prison here


68
00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:02.825
than anywhere else in the world.

69
00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.761
You need to know how
to handle


70
00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:06.829
an out-of-control
police officer.


71
00:03:06.863 --> 00:03:08.631
Yes, why am I gonna--
[grunts]


72
00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:11.801
[Matthew] How to survive
an interrogation,


73
00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:15.805
how to survive County jail
and an extreme prison sentence.


74
00:03:15.838 --> 00:03:19.108
[woman wailing]

75
00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:22.712
To take us through the steps...

76
00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:26.549
we're going to follow
the stories of two Americans...


77
00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:31.521
Bruce Lisker, an innocent man
convicted of murder,


78
00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:34.223
and Reggie Cole,
another innocent man


79
00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.959
who endured
an even more horrific nightmare.


80
00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:41.564
We're going to get perspectives
from investigative journalists,


81
00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:43.500
analysts, academics,
prison staff,


82
00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:45.067
lawyers, cops, inmates.

83
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:47.003
[Danny]
So in the unfortunate case


84
00:03:47.036 --> 00:03:48.871
that this may happen to you,

85
00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:52.575
this is the survivor's guide
to prison.


86
00:03:55.545 --> 00:03:58.481
* They controlling you?
They got a hold on you *


87
00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:01.484
* You need a man in a suit
to tell you what to do? *


88
00:04:01.518 --> 00:04:03.620
* I'll grab the podium mic
and open the knife *


89
00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:05.588
* We don't read
between the lines *


90
00:04:05.622 --> 00:04:07.557
* Let alone the stripes
and the stars *


91
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.526
* Presidents get popped
in their cars *


92
00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:11.528
* I ain't coppin' the drop,
real talk *


93
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:13.930
[door clangs]

94
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.737
[Susan] As an American citizen,
you don't have to be


95
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.675
a murderer or a rapist
or a thief to be arrested.


96
00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:27.877
You can call the police
in an emergency


97
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.946
and find yourself arrested
just because


98
00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.181
the officer doesn't like you.

99
00:04:34.617 --> 00:04:36.653
[man] My strongest memory
of my mom


100
00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:41.858
is she was very into teaching
and sharing.


101
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:43.593
We loved each other.

102
00:04:43.626 --> 00:04:45.027
I would've put my own life
on the line


103
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:46.963
to try to save my mom's
had I known


104
00:04:46.996 --> 00:04:48.998
anything like this
was going to happen.


105
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.103
And it was a day just
like any other day.


106
00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:56.773
I went over
to my parents' house.


107
00:04:56.806 --> 00:04:58.941
Normally, when I went over,
my mom would come out


108
00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:01.277
on the front porch to greet me.

109
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.614
And that day,
she didn't come to the door.


110
00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:07.717
I was able to see her
on the floor,


111
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.888
and she had been stabbed
and beaten and left for dead.


112
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.724
- [woman screams]
- And I was just freaking out.


113
00:05:14.757 --> 00:05:16.693
[voices over telephone]

114
00:05:21.097 --> 00:05:24.100
I was hysterical,
and I was yelling and screaming


115
00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:27.236
at the paramedics to hurry up
and get her to the hospital


116
00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:30.339
so that the doctors could
do something to save her life.


117
00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:33.976
And the police choke-holded me
and handcuffed me


118
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.246
and put me in the car
for my own safety, ostensibly.


119
00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.348
You call the authorities
when something goes wrong.


120
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.050
I mean, you call for help,

121
00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:43.085
and you put
your full faith in them.


122
00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:45.655
I was telling the police,
"I want to go to the hospital


123
00:05:45.688 --> 00:05:50.159
to be with my mom,"
screaming, crying, you know?


124
00:05:50.192 --> 00:05:53.129
And he said, "No, we have to go
to Van Nuys Police Department."


125
00:05:53.162 --> 00:05:57.166
[Susan]
The detective interrogated
Bruce for two hours.


126
00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.903
[Bruce] By the time he was done
interrogating me, she had died.


127
00:06:03.806 --> 00:06:05.608
[softly] Fuck.

128
00:06:05.642 --> 00:06:07.944
[sniffles, chuckles]

129
00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:11.013
[Matthew]
So what would you do?


130
00:06:11.047 --> 00:06:12.949
Tell the cops whatever
they want to know?


131
00:06:12.982 --> 00:06:14.817
- Demand they release you.
- Scream?


132
00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:16.686
- Argue.
- Maybe even fight.


133
00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:25.895
There are a number
of citizen watchdog groups...


134
00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:28.297
Who observe and record
police misconduct.


135
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.700
Their advice
is to always be polite.


136
00:06:30.733 --> 00:06:33.903
Never engage with an aggravated
or confrontational officer.


137
00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:35.805
First of all,
you disrespected me,


138
00:06:35.838 --> 00:06:39.008
this badge, and my department,
you understand me?!


139
00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:41.110
When I'm talking to you,
you shut your mouth!


140
00:06:41.143 --> 00:06:44.881
Ask, "Am I being detained,
or am I free to go?"


141
00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:47.784
It's just it's unusual behavior,
is what we're getting at.


142
00:06:47.817 --> 00:06:49.085
[man] I'm assuming
I'm being detained.


143
00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:50.687
Am I being the detained
or not?


144
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.421
- You can go, sir.
- Thank you.


145
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:55.057
If you're not being detained,
leave immediately.


146
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:56.659
If you are being detained,

147
00:06:56.693 --> 00:06:58.160
the police can legally lie
to you.


148
00:06:58.194 --> 00:07:00.196
So, don't get into
any conversation


149
00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:03.432
or start answering questions,
just ask for an attorney.


150
00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:06.168
If you're arrested,
never talk to anybody


151
00:07:06.202 --> 00:07:07.870
without an attorney there.

152
00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:11.340
[Matthew] Susan Mellon
was 42 years old


153
00:07:11.373 --> 00:07:13.876
in Gardena California
when she was accused


154
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.745
of a murder she didn't commit.

155
00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:18.815
The detective
assigned to the case


156
00:07:18.848 --> 00:07:21.117
was relying on the testimony
of one witness.


157
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.054
The whole case hinged
on the word of one person,


158
00:07:25.087 --> 00:07:29.091
June Patty,
and everything June Patty said


159
00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:31.260
was inconsistent
with every other lead.


160
00:07:31.293 --> 00:07:34.296
Every single lead
put three gang members


161
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.335
in the house...
and no women.


162
00:07:39.368 --> 00:07:41.437
[Susan] I was pleading
that I was innocent.


163
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.107
[woman's voice]

164
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.376
When I left my daughter there,
I just remember telling her


165
00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:50.713
that, "Don't worry, baby,
I'll be back for dinner."


166
00:07:50.747 --> 00:07:52.481
[Matthew]
Susan's daughter, Jessica.


167
00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:55.184
She said to me that she
was gonna be home for dinner,


168
00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:59.155
and she was home

169
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:04.861
[Susan] Not seeing my children,
that was very hard on me.


170
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.799
For all those years,
I'm still broken.


171
00:08:09.832 --> 00:08:12.935
My heart's still broken
from everything I went through.


172
00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:16.138
It's-- I don't know,
it's just so scary.


173
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.078
It was the worst nightmare
of my whole life.


174
00:08:25.247 --> 00:08:27.516
The bottom line is you have
a right to be silent.


175
00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:30.086
Keep your mouth shut

176
00:08:30.119 --> 00:08:32.521
because those words
will be used against you.


177
00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.490
To survive and interrogation,

178
00:08:34.523 --> 00:08:37.359
you've got to be ready
to stand your ground...


179
00:08:40.997 --> 00:08:44.066
against bullying, aggression,
and intimidation.


180
00:08:49.538 --> 00:08:51.941
No matter how intimidating
they get,


181
00:08:51.974 --> 00:08:54.911
just say,
"I want to speak to a lawyer."


182
00:08:54.944 --> 00:08:56.478
And I hope you can afford
a good one.


183
00:08:56.512 --> 00:08:58.547
I didn't have
an adequate attorney.


184
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.850
It was a drive-by shooting that
took place in East Los Angeles.


185
00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:03.052
I looked like
the actual shooter.


186
00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:04.520
I "resembled"
was the correct word.


187
00:09:04.553 --> 00:09:06.522
I served approximately
nine years


188
00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:08.825
and eight months in prison.

189
00:09:08.858 --> 00:09:11.127
[Matthew] If you don't have
an adequate attorney,


190
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.329
your entire future
rests in the hands


191
00:09:13.362 --> 00:09:15.297
of a detective assigned
to your case.


192
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:18.334
The words of Bruce Lisker
were used against him.


193
00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:20.569
And you're dealing
with a 17-year-old kid,


194
00:09:20.602 --> 00:09:24.240
and they were able to manipulate
him and twist things.


195
00:09:24.273 --> 00:09:27.209
My case was assigned
to a homicide detective


196
00:09:27.243 --> 00:09:29.478
who--
it was one of his first cases.


197
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:33.883
He hadn't even gone to homicide
school yet with the LAPD.


198
00:09:33.916 --> 00:09:36.485
And he jumped the gun
and basically decided


199
00:09:36.518 --> 00:09:38.220
that 'cause
I was a long-haired kid


200
00:09:38.254 --> 00:09:40.289
who looked like he smoked pot,
which I did,


201
00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:42.825
that I was the person
who had attacked my mother.


202
00:09:42.859 --> 00:09:45.895
He must have had
all of his colleagues


203
00:09:45.928 --> 00:09:47.864
scrutinizing him,
looking at him.


204
00:09:47.897 --> 00:09:50.900
"How long is it gonna take you
to solve this one, Andy?"


205
00:09:50.933 --> 00:09:54.536
And, well, he did it in minutes,
didn't he?


206
00:09:57.874 --> 00:10:01.210
[Matthew] In 1994, Reggie Cole
was 18 years old


207
00:10:01.243 --> 00:10:04.146
living in South Central LA
with no criminal record


208
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.349
when he was arrested for
the murder of Felipe Angeles.


209
00:10:07.383 --> 00:10:10.352
The only eyewitness
was a man named John Jones,


210
00:10:10.386 --> 00:10:12.621
the owner of a brothel
across the street


211
00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:15.124
known as Johnny's
House of Prostitution.


212
00:10:15.157 --> 00:10:16.893
How long has this place
been in operation?


213
00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:19.061
- About 17 years.
- About 17 years?


214
00:10:19.095 --> 00:10:21.530
The police were willing
to overlook


215
00:10:21.563 --> 00:10:23.465
what John Jones was doing.

216
00:10:23.499 --> 00:10:26.635
Then John Jones
would be willing to play along


217
00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.538
with whatever the cops
wanted him to do.


218
00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:32.574
16 years later,
a new theory would emerge


219
00:10:32.608 --> 00:10:35.878
that the actual shooter was
more likely John Jones himself


220
00:10:35.912 --> 00:10:38.214
firing from the rooftop
of his own building.


221
00:10:38.247 --> 00:10:40.449
But the arresting officer
on the case


222
00:10:40.482 --> 00:10:42.451
was sure the murderer
was Reggie Cole.


223
00:10:42.484 --> 00:10:44.553
It was her first--
her first case,


224
00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:47.523
and she needed to close
the case


225
00:10:47.556 --> 00:10:51.327
in order for her to get
her shield, her homicide shield.


226
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.631
To be a doctor,

227
00:10:55.664 --> 00:10:57.633
you have to go to school
for many years.


228
00:10:57.666 --> 00:11:00.036
To be a lawyer, you have to go
to school for many years.


229
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:03.973
I don't understand how somebody
with just a high school diploma


230
00:11:04.006 --> 00:11:07.109
or a GED can have
that type of power,


231
00:11:07.143 --> 00:11:10.146
to be an officer of the law
with a pistol


232
00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:12.381
that can take
someone's life, literally,


233
00:11:12.414 --> 00:11:14.583
or with the charges
they put on you.


234
00:11:14.616 --> 00:11:17.153
People, they don't--
they don't feel the need


235
00:11:17.186 --> 00:11:19.355
to speak up because
it doesn't happen to them.


236
00:11:19.388 --> 00:11:21.958
"Oh, that's-- that's messed up,
you know what I mean?


237
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:24.126
But it can never happen to me."
Yes, it could.


238
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.295
It could happen to you
just like that.


239
00:11:26.328 --> 00:11:29.465
[Bruce] Every staff member,
everybody that I encountered


240
00:11:29.498 --> 00:11:31.100
I was saying,
"A mistake has been made.


241
00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:32.634
I didn't do anything,"

242
00:11:32.668 --> 00:11:35.437
Begging for phone calls
to talk to my dad.


243
00:11:35.471 --> 00:11:39.341
You know, from moment to moment,
the reality


244
00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:44.080
that my mother's dead...

245
00:11:44.113 --> 00:11:46.482
would just bring an icy chill.

246
00:11:53.255 --> 00:11:55.324
First thing the next morning,
I was taken up front


247
00:11:55.357 --> 00:11:57.326
to talk to a psychologist
or psychiatrist,


248
00:11:57.359 --> 00:11:59.395
and in this cheery
kind of a voice,


249
00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:02.198
he says, "So, how do you feel
about being here at Sylmar?"


250
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:06.468
And I said, you know,
"Are you kidding?"


251
00:12:06.502 --> 00:12:08.971
[Susan] Since the LAPD
report stated


252
00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:11.273
that Bruce stabbed his mother
to death,


253
00:12:11.307 --> 00:12:14.343
the doctor determined
that Bruce must be psychotic.


254
00:12:17.079 --> 00:12:19.381
Prison healthcare
is a disgrace.


255
00:12:19.415 --> 00:12:22.351
I mean,
it's more like a horror show.


256
00:12:26.422 --> 00:12:29.625
The medical conditions
inside of prisons in California


257
00:12:29.658 --> 00:12:31.327
have been so bad for so long.

258
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.694
You're talking about
misdiagnosis,


259
00:12:32.728 --> 00:12:35.497
just barbaric conditions.

260
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:38.634
So a district court in 2002
said that an outside agency


261
00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:40.769
had to come in
and take over


262
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:44.306
the entire medical system
in the prisons.


263
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.575
[Matthew] Today, after spending
billions of dollars,


264
00:12:46.608 --> 00:12:49.111
some California prisons
still fail to meet even


265
00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:52.381
the most basic constitutional
standards for healthcare.


266
00:12:52.414 --> 00:12:54.316
If you have a serious
mental illness,


267
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.185
the United States of America

268
00:12:56.218 --> 00:12:58.187
is probably the worst place
you want to be.


269
00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.058
If you don't have the money
to pay for constant care,


270
00:13:02.091 --> 00:13:04.626
you in danger
of facing law enforcement.


271
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.429
[voices over telephone]

272
00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:15.704
If you're a schizophrenic
or a bipolar,


273
00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:18.174
you are 16 times
more likely to die


274
00:13:18.207 --> 00:13:20.242
when encountering
law enforcement.


275
00:13:20.276 --> 00:13:22.611
[male reporter] A 5-foot-3,

276
00:13:22.644 --> 00:13:24.480
when he was stunned.

277
00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:26.482
Two officers
then jumped on top of him,


278
00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:29.418
and while they held him down,
the third officer,


279
00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:31.420
who ordered the stun guns

280
00:13:31.453 --> 00:13:34.290
then shot Keith in the chest
and killed him.


281
00:13:34.323 --> 00:13:36.692
And if you don't die,

282
00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:40.462
you're ten times more likely to
land in prison than a hospital.


283
00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.201
The national
sheriff's association


284
00:13:45.234 --> 00:13:47.369
got together with a treatment
advocacy center.


285
00:13:47.403 --> 00:13:48.570
They looked into it.

286
00:13:48.604 --> 00:13:51.107
It turns out, 50%--

287
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.575
50% of the people
who are locked up


288
00:13:53.609 --> 00:13:56.278
have some kind
of mental health issue.


289
00:13:58.614 --> 00:14:02.751
[man] We will not negotiate
with terrorists!


290
00:14:02.784 --> 00:14:06.088
[Matthew] In the 1960s,
state psychiatric hospitals


291
00:14:06.122 --> 00:14:09.191
began closing
and the nation's mentally ill


292
00:14:09.225 --> 00:14:10.792
found themselves
on the streets,


293
00:14:10.826 --> 00:14:13.195
often winding up in prison.

294
00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:15.564
If you're mentally ill
and you're in prison,


295
00:14:15.597 --> 00:14:17.366
you're more likely
to get worse,


296
00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.635
experience increased
behavioral problems,


297
00:14:19.668 --> 00:14:21.837
and you're going to be
disproportionately abused,


298
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.772
beaten, and raped.

299
00:14:23.805 --> 00:14:26.142
You're more likely
to commit suicide.


300
00:14:26.175 --> 00:14:28.110
And if you're released,
you're more likely


301
00:14:28.144 --> 00:14:30.112
to reoffend
and come right back.


302
00:14:30.146 --> 00:14:33.615
Most prison staff
are poorly equipped to diagnose,


303
00:14:33.649 --> 00:14:35.817
manage,
or treat your condition.


304
00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:38.754
And if you add that all up,
you know,


305
00:14:38.787 --> 00:14:42.824
it makes me ask the question,
who are the crazy ones?


306
00:14:45.561 --> 00:14:48.164
[coughing]

307
00:14:51.633 --> 00:14:55.837
[man] I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!


308
00:14:55.871 --> 00:14:58.340
[Bruce]
And then I was medicated.


309
00:14:58.374 --> 00:15:00.709
I was given Mellaril,
which is like Thorazine.


310
00:15:00.742 --> 00:15:02.478
Numbed my brain.

311
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:05.547
I was a very docile inmate
at that point.


312
00:15:05.581 --> 00:15:08.150
[Matthew] Warning,
side effects of Thorazine


313
00:15:08.184 --> 00:15:10.819
may include sedation,
slurred speech,


314
00:15:10.852 --> 00:15:13.222
dizziness, memory loss.

315
00:15:13.255 --> 00:15:15.591
So the odds of fighting
your case may be difficult.


316
00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:17.593
Hopefully, you have someone
on the outside


317
00:15:17.626 --> 00:15:19.395
working on your behalf.

318
00:15:19.428 --> 00:15:21.163
[Susan] Bruce was kept
in a single cell


319
00:15:21.197 --> 00:15:24.766
23 hours a day
for the next 19 days.


320
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.802
[Matthew] Over their
two visits together,


321
00:15:26.835 --> 00:15:28.670
Bruce and his father
were confident


322
00:15:28.704 --> 00:15:30.672
they'd solve the murder.

323
00:15:30.706 --> 00:15:34.310
[Bruce] I met Mike Ryan in
a 12-step program that I was in.


324
00:15:34.343 --> 00:15:35.944
He didn't have a place to stay,

325
00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:38.347
and I let him stay on the couch
in my apartment.


326
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.417
And he basically
stopped paying any rent.


327
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.453
You know, worked up my courage
and said, "You have to go.


328
00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:46.455
You know, I have to
kick you out, man, sorry."


329
00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:48.824
So, I started like taking
some of his stuff


330
00:15:48.857 --> 00:15:50.892
off the shelves
and putting them into boxes.


331
00:15:50.926 --> 00:15:54.796
And he grabbed me and put me
against the bathroom door jam


332
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.499
and held a knife to my throat
and said,


333
00:15:57.533 --> 00:15:59.701
"If you ever touch
my shit again, I'll kill you."


334
00:15:59.735 --> 00:16:03.639
And he was gone, and I thought,
whew, thank God, he's gone.


335
00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:05.807
My mom told my dad
the day before the murder


336
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:08.210
that Mike Ryan had been there
that day looking for money,


337
00:16:08.244 --> 00:16:09.978
looking for food,
looking for-- you know.


338
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.548
We know it in our hearts,
my dad and I,


339
00:16:12.581 --> 00:16:14.483
Mike Ryan killed my mom.

340
00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:18.554
This is-- this is the letter
Lisker writes to Monsue


341
00:16:18.587 --> 00:16:20.289
after he's arrested.

342
00:16:20.322 --> 00:16:22.358
He's behind bars,
and he goes, "Dear sir,


343
00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:25.261
I'm sure that by this point,
it has become apparent to you


344
00:16:25.294 --> 00:16:26.862
that I am not the murderer."

345
00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:29.765
And this is where
he turns him on to Ryan


346
00:16:29.798 --> 00:16:31.667
as a potential suspect.

347
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.538
When Monsue went to find Ryan
to interview him,


348
00:16:36.572 --> 00:16:40.909
he tracks him down in a jail
in Mississippi


349
00:16:40.942 --> 00:16:43.011
where I think he was arrested

350
00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.814
for breaking
into a woman's house.


351
00:16:45.847 --> 00:16:48.016
His story was so full of holes,
I mean,


352
00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:49.785
you could have driven
a truck through it.


353
00:16:49.818 --> 00:16:51.653
He said that he was sleeping
on the streets.


354
00:16:51.687 --> 00:16:55.991
He was sleeping in carports
until March 10th,


355
00:16:56.024 --> 00:16:58.260
when he checked
into a Hollywood motel,


356
00:16:58.294 --> 00:17:01.563
which is 12 miles away from
our house at around 11:00 AM.


357
00:17:12.974 --> 00:17:15.844
Suddenly,
at 3:00 PM on March 10th,


358
00:17:15.877 --> 00:17:17.913
four hours after my mom
was killed and robbed,


359
00:17:17.946 --> 00:17:22.751
he has money to check
into a motel.


360
00:17:22.784 --> 00:17:26.488
I don't think that Monsue
was out to get Lisker.


361
00:17:26.522 --> 00:17:29.525
I think that he developed what
detectives call tunnel vision.


362
00:17:29.558 --> 00:17:33.662
I had heard a lot of things
about him being narrow-minded.


363
00:17:33.695 --> 00:17:35.697
Once he made his mind up,

364
00:17:35.731 --> 00:17:39.000
there was no way of--
of making him change his mind.


365
00:17:39.034 --> 00:17:43.305
And so, that-- that leads
to some serious problems


366
00:17:43.339 --> 00:17:45.474
when you're dealing
with a homicide investigation.


367
00:17:45.507 --> 00:17:47.643
[Matthew] Detective Monsue
did a search


368
00:17:47.676 --> 00:17:49.911
on Mike Ryan's criminal record,

369
00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:51.980
apparently using
the wrong birth date.


370
00:17:52.013 --> 00:17:53.582
He had the wrong date
of birth for him,


371
00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.584
and if he had the right date
of birth


372
00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.419
and he checked
criminal records back then,


373
00:17:57.453 --> 00:17:59.521
he would've found
that just a few months prior


374
00:17:59.555 --> 00:18:01.657
to the Dorka Lisker slaying,

375
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.861
Ryan had allegedly held a knife
to a friend's throat over $12,


376
00:18:05.894 --> 00:18:08.430
which you would think
would cause, you know,


377
00:18:08.464 --> 00:18:11.099
a detective to consider him
a little more seriously,


378
00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:13.001
you know, for the offense
he was investigating.


379
00:18:13.034 --> 00:18:14.736
Eventually, like Bruce,

380
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.738
you're gonna have
a detention hearing.


381
00:18:16.772 --> 00:18:19.107
During which time a judge
is going to make a determination


382
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.109
as to whether you're going to
stay in jail


383
00:18:21.142 --> 00:18:23.445
or you can be released
while you await your trial.


384
00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:26.782
Well, unless you have
a lot of money for attorneys,


385
00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:28.517
you're not going anywhere.

386
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.118
Basically, you go in there
with your hands


387
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:32.020
tied behind your back
because of the power


388
00:18:32.053 --> 00:18:36.124
that we give to police officers
in this nation.


389
00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.893
His word carried the day.

390
00:18:37.926 --> 00:18:39.895
The Constitution is supposed
to guarantee


391
00:18:39.928 --> 00:18:42.764
a speedy trial
and prohibit the use


392
00:18:42.798 --> 00:18:45.100
of cruel and unusual punishment.

393
00:18:45.133 --> 00:18:48.604
Myself, I spent 15 months
before trial


394
00:18:48.637 --> 00:18:52.040
in the county jail
in deplorable conditions.


395
00:18:52.073 --> 00:18:55.110
I was in numerous riots,

396
00:18:55.143 --> 00:18:57.646
various situations
where I had to defend myself.


397
00:18:57.679 --> 00:19:00.949
I made a new word.
It's called I was petrinoid.


398
00:19:00.982 --> 00:19:04.520
I was petrified
and paranoid at the same time.


399
00:19:04.553 --> 00:19:06.722
Surviving County jail.

400
00:19:11.693 --> 00:19:15.130
The first thing that you're
going to want to do is get out.


401
00:19:15.163 --> 00:19:20.469
So whatever you have to do
to get the money, it's worth it.


402
00:19:20.502 --> 00:19:22.704
You definitely don't want
to be going to trial


403
00:19:22.738 --> 00:19:24.873
in a jumpsuit or in cuffs.

404
00:19:24.906 --> 00:19:26.808
[Matthew] A study of defendants
in Kentucky found


405
00:19:26.842 --> 00:19:29.010
that individuals in jail
were over three times


406
00:19:29.044 --> 00:19:31.146
more likely to be sentenced
to prison


407
00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:32.748
than those who were released
and showed up for court


408
00:19:32.781 --> 00:19:33.949
in regular clothes.

409
00:19:33.982 --> 00:19:35.951
If you're stuck in jail,

410
00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:39.555
be prepared to be completely
humiliated and violated.


411
00:19:39.588 --> 00:19:42.891
You are going to be stripped
of all your personal possessions


412
00:19:42.924 --> 00:19:44.626
and your clothing.

413
00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.163
Your integrity,
your respect, everything.


414
00:19:48.196 --> 00:19:51.166
Keep to yourself.
Be polite and ask permission...


415
00:19:51.199 --> 00:19:53.101
- To use the water fountain.
- The bathroom.


416
00:19:53.134 --> 00:19:54.169
- The lights.
- The sink.


417
00:19:54.202 --> 00:19:55.937
That's it right there.

418
00:19:55.971 --> 00:19:57.072
Mind your own business
and be respectful.


419
00:19:57.105 --> 00:19:58.674
Never call the guards

420
00:19:58.707 --> 00:19:59.775
if you got a problem
with somebody.


421
00:19:59.808 --> 00:20:01.677
Just talk to the person

422
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.845
that you have a problem with
directly or let it go.


423
00:20:03.879 --> 00:20:06.715
You're gonna want to make a lot
of phone calls to your family.


424
00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.617
- To get advice.
- Find a lawyer.


425
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.852
- To talk to a friend.
- To find out how to get out.


426
00:20:10.886 --> 00:20:12.854
As quickly as possible.

427
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.626
They can charge
over a dollar a minute.


428
00:20:17.659 --> 00:20:19.861
Calls to and from your lawyer,

429
00:20:19.895 --> 00:20:22.731
your son, daughter,
your mom, or your dad.


430
00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:25.233
I wouldn't want to do any time
in the county jail at all.


431
00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:26.835
It's not bearable
because they don't treat you


432
00:20:26.868 --> 00:20:28.904
with any type of respect.

433
00:20:28.937 --> 00:20:31.206
Like, you're supposed to be
innocent until proven guilty.


434
00:20:31.239 --> 00:20:33.642
Okay, well, this is a place
where it should show that.


435
00:20:39.515 --> 00:20:42.818
"Innocent until proven guilty"
originally meant...


436
00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:45.954
[Matthew] Nobody should
ever be denied a trial.


437
00:20:45.987 --> 00:20:47.756
And it was created
as a protection...


438
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:50.025
Against torturing people
into confessions.


439
00:20:50.058 --> 00:20:51.793
It was established
as a shield...


440
00:20:51.827 --> 00:20:55.764
Against mob mentality
and witch hunts.


441
00:20:55.797 --> 00:20:59.200
And this presumption of
innocence until proven guilty


442
00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:02.504
is a foundational notion
of civil justice.


443
00:21:02.538 --> 00:21:04.072
The problem is,
is that it's


444
00:21:04.105 --> 00:21:06.708
a difficult principle
to preserve.


445
00:21:06.742 --> 00:21:09.044
You have to be vigilant
about preserving it.


446
00:21:09.077 --> 00:21:11.146
[Matthew]
David Sirota's an investigative
journalist who's done


447
00:21:11.179 --> 00:21:13.515
extensive work in America's
criminal justice system.


448
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:17.152
Our media culture,
where the camera is on,


449
00:21:17.185 --> 00:21:18.920
you've got Court TV...

450
00:21:18.954 --> 00:21:21.890
On the murder count,
he is going to walk.


451
00:21:21.923 --> 00:21:23.825
[crowd] No justice!
No peace!


452
00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:25.293
People want to see retribution.

453
00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:26.895
They want to see
somebody punished.


454
00:21:26.928 --> 00:21:29.598
Who in the heck
is in that jury room?


455
00:21:29.631 --> 00:21:30.866
You've got politicians
running around.


456
00:21:30.899 --> 00:21:32.768
Just stoking the flames.

457
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:36.004
When folks mess with Americans,
we go after them.


458
00:21:36.037 --> 00:21:38.907
- People want revenge.
- And it's reminiscent


459
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.777
of medieval times,
people screaming for blood.


460
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.845
And our present culture
doesn't seem to value


461
00:21:43.879 --> 00:21:46.715
the concept of innocent
until proven guilty.


462
00:21:46.748 --> 00:21:50.251
And so, unless you're vigilant
about preserving


463
00:21:50.285 --> 00:21:52.253
a presumption of innocence,

464
00:21:52.287 --> 00:21:54.289
then you're going to lose
that presumption of innocence.


465
00:21:54.322 --> 00:21:56.124
Kalief Browder was a teenager.

466
00:21:56.157 --> 00:21:58.193
He was walking home
from school


467
00:21:58.226 --> 00:22:00.095
when someone accused him
of stealing a backpack.


468
00:22:00.128 --> 00:22:01.697
The police didn't do
any investigating.


469
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.632
They just arrested him.

470
00:22:03.665 --> 00:22:04.866
And the next thing you know,
they putting the cuffs.


471
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.835
I don't even know this dude.

472
00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:08.970
His family couldn't afford
the $10,000 bail.


473
00:22:09.004 --> 00:22:11.573
Kalief was subjected
to officer assaults,


474
00:22:11.607 --> 00:22:13.074
which you can see here,

475
00:22:13.108 --> 00:22:15.243
and groups of inmates
attacking him.


476
00:22:15.276 --> 00:22:17.312
They was just all bawling
on my head to the point


477
00:22:17.345 --> 00:22:20.916
where I just had to just grab
my head, like, I can't take it.


478
00:22:20.949 --> 00:22:22.984
[female reporter]
He missed his sister's wedding,


479
00:22:23.018 --> 00:22:25.353
the birth of his nephew,
and so many family events.


480
00:22:25.386 --> 00:22:28.824
[Matthew] After nearly three
years of unimaginable torture,


481
00:22:28.857 --> 00:22:32.360
incarcerated without a trial,
he was finally offered a deal.


482
00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:34.730
If he would plead guilty,
they'd let him go.


483
00:22:34.763 --> 00:22:37.699
She told me if I lose trial,
I could get 15 years.


484
00:22:37.733 --> 00:22:39.200
Take the time served,

485
00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:40.869
and you go home today
if you say you did it.


486
00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:42.604
I didn't do it.
I'm not saying I did that.


487
00:22:42.638 --> 00:22:44.640
[reporter]
He went back to jail.


488
00:22:44.673 --> 00:22:48.176
In June, he was suddenly freed
with no explanation.


489
00:22:48.209 --> 00:22:49.945
No apology, no nothing.

490
00:22:49.978 --> 00:22:52.280
They just said,
"Oh, case dismissed.


491
00:22:52.313 --> 00:22:54.850
Don't worry about nothing."
What do you mean?


492
00:22:54.883 --> 00:22:57.118
Y'all just took over
three years of my life.


493
00:22:57.152 --> 00:22:59.721
[Matthew]
The New Yorker reported
that Kalief's relatives


494
00:22:59.755 --> 00:23:02.858
said he was inflicted
by paranoia, suspecting cops


495
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:05.226
or other authority figures
were after him.


496
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.863
Two years after he was released
from Riker's Island,


497
00:23:07.896 --> 00:23:10.699
Kalief Browder
took his own life.


498
00:23:13.334 --> 00:23:16.237
The eighth amendment
to the US Constitution


499
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:18.339
is also supposed to guarantee
us the right


500
00:23:18.373 --> 00:23:20.308
to be free
from excessive bail.


501
00:23:22.678 --> 00:23:24.880
Bail is money
that you temporarily loan


502
00:23:24.913 --> 00:23:26.682
or give the courts
as collateral to guarantee


503
00:23:26.715 --> 00:23:28.283
that you're going to show up
for your trial.


504
00:23:28.316 --> 00:23:30.251
But like the rest
of the eighth amendment,


505
00:23:30.285 --> 00:23:32.688
this idea that you're supposed
to be free from excessive bail


506
00:23:32.721 --> 00:23:34.155
is a right
that's regularly violated


507
00:23:34.189 --> 00:23:35.957
by our criminal justice system.

508
00:23:35.991 --> 00:23:38.159
Meanwhile,
the bail bond industry


509
00:23:38.193 --> 00:23:41.963
is making profits
of $2 billion a year.


510
00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:50.371
What we would need
is at least for you


511
00:23:50.405 --> 00:23:52.874
to be employed two years
on the job.


512
00:23:52.908 --> 00:23:56.411
What you do need to pay
is going to be 10%.


513
00:23:59.147 --> 00:24:01.917
[Susan]
After 30 days in custody,


514
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.986
Bruce finally had
the opportunity to post bail.


515
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.423
Bail was set at $250,000.

516
00:24:08.456 --> 00:24:11.126
Neither Bruce
or his father had the money.


517
00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:14.162
I was scared shitless.
I was so frightened.


518
00:24:14.195 --> 00:24:16.331
The whole way down,
I just thought, this is--


519
00:24:16.364 --> 00:24:18.767
you know, I keep using the word
"nightmare,"


520
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.337
but I mean, this could be
the end of my life.


521
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.372
I don't know.
I don't know.


522
00:24:24.405 --> 00:24:26.441
The most important thing
that I can tell you


523
00:24:26.474 --> 00:24:28.009
is to protect yourself.

524
00:24:28.043 --> 00:24:29.711
Don't talk to people.

525
00:24:29.745 --> 00:24:31.713
If you're running off
at the mouth,


526
00:24:31.747 --> 00:24:33.348
you're usually going to dig
yourself a hole.


527
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:36.351
If you want to survive
in jail or prison,


528
00:24:36.384 --> 00:24:38.419
take the advice of old-timers.

529
00:24:38.453 --> 00:24:40.255
[Matthew] This is Tim.

530
00:24:40.288 --> 00:24:41.990
He's going to elaborate

531
00:24:42.023 --> 00:24:44.092
on the most important
rule of all.


532
00:24:44.125 --> 00:24:47.829
[man] I want you
to pay attention!


533
00:24:47.863 --> 00:24:51.399
In 1986,
Tim was 19 years old.


534
00:24:51.432 --> 00:24:53.401
He got involved with a girl
who was in some trouble.


535
00:24:53.434 --> 00:24:55.436
[Tim]
She's living with this guy.


536
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.307
She starts insinuating that
she's being sexually abused.


537
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.042
But like a dummy,

538
00:25:01.076 --> 00:25:03.278
I'm contemplating going
and getting her stuff.


539
00:25:03.311 --> 00:25:06.514
She says that he's got a gun so,
you know, we got to be careful.


540
00:25:06.547 --> 00:25:08.750
The guy that we're going with,
he's like, "Well, that's cool.


541
00:25:08.784 --> 00:25:10.151
We'll just take our own guns."

542
00:25:10.185 --> 00:25:12.120
They start wrestling
over this gun.


543
00:25:12.153 --> 00:25:15.723
I step out of the bathroom.
Fight or flight.


544
00:25:17.425 --> 00:25:19.160
No excuses.
Just dumb.


545
00:25:19.194 --> 00:25:20.996
This is-- there's no excuse
for what I did.


546
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:23.098
There's no excuse.
Pulled out my gun.


547
00:25:23.131 --> 00:25:26.434
I start shooting.
He falls behind the door.


548
00:25:26.467 --> 00:25:29.337
I pull Rob out of the door,
kick the door,


549
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.406
and I shoot him again
in the head


550
00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:33.441
and was sentenced
to 25 years to life


551
00:25:33.474 --> 00:25:35.276
in the California prison system.

552
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.079
Tim's first advice
to new fish is simple.


553
00:25:38.113 --> 00:25:42.450
Start with, you got two eyes
and two ears and one mouth.


554
00:25:42.483 --> 00:25:44.152
So you should be seeing
and hearing


555
00:25:44.185 --> 00:25:45.353
a whole lot more
than you're saying.


556
00:25:45.386 --> 00:25:47.122
If you don't take that advice,

557
00:25:47.155 --> 00:25:49.457
you're usually going to dig
yourself a hole


558
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.793
because while you're talking,

559
00:25:51.827 --> 00:25:54.129
how many other people
are listening and watching?


560
00:25:54.162 --> 00:25:57.032
Keep it zipped up,
and don't think


561
00:25:57.065 --> 00:25:59.067
that any of those dudes
are your friends.


562
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.203
[Bruce]
I was put in a cell alone


563
00:26:02.237 --> 00:26:04.472
when I started hearing
this scraping sound.


564
00:26:04.505 --> 00:26:09.177
It gets louder and louder,
and it persists and finally,


565
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.846
there's a hole in the wall now.

566
00:26:10.879 --> 00:26:12.380
And I'm like,
"Leave me alone."


567
00:26:12.413 --> 00:26:14.215
"Hey, youngster,
you know, what's up?


568
00:26:14.249 --> 00:26:16.985
My name's Bobby."
He said, "I'm a Christian.


569
00:26:17.018 --> 00:26:19.187
You don't have
to worry about me, I'm okay.


570
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.156
Want a cigarette?
Do you smoke?"


571
00:26:21.189 --> 00:26:23.291
And he wants
to Bible study with me.


572
00:26:23.324 --> 00:26:25.426
And he was, you know,
reading the Bible


573
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.329
about hope and about,
you know, truth.


574
00:26:28.363 --> 00:26:29.998
Basically,
I had told him


575
00:26:30.031 --> 00:26:31.599
everything
that I was arrested for.


576
00:26:31.632 --> 00:26:33.201
"What's your attorney
doing for you?"


577
00:26:33.234 --> 00:26:34.602
I said, "Well, not much.

578
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:36.371
I'm sitting here still,
you know?"


579
00:26:36.404 --> 00:26:38.306
He goes well,
"I'll help you with your case.


580
00:26:38.339 --> 00:26:40.942
Anything that I can do,"
and, you know, by the way,


581
00:26:40.976 --> 00:26:42.610
do you have any money
that I could--


582
00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:44.312
you know, I don't have
any money and, you know,


583
00:26:44.345 --> 00:26:46.047
if you can help me out
with some money."


584
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:48.149
My dad put money
on his books for him,


585
00:26:48.183 --> 00:26:52.020
and my attorney comes down
and has a tape recorder


586
00:26:52.053 --> 00:26:56.024
and pushes play,
and it's Robert Hughes


587
00:26:56.057 --> 00:26:59.861
on the tape saying I met Lisker
in the 7000 module


588
00:26:59.895 --> 00:27:02.898
of the county jail and,
you know,


589
00:27:02.931 --> 00:27:05.266
he ran down
how he killed his mom.


590
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:10.338
My jaw is just on the table.
I can't believe it.


591
00:27:10.371 --> 00:27:12.540
This was my friend,
this Robert Hughes,


592
00:27:12.573 --> 00:27:14.475
this Christian,
this good guy.


593
00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:18.279
My case was the fourth case,
fourth defendant


594
00:27:18.313 --> 00:27:20.882
against whom Robert Hughes
had come forward and claimed


595
00:27:20.916 --> 00:27:23.919
a confession in the span
of about a year and a half.


596
00:27:23.952 --> 00:27:25.987
[Matt] I think for about
a decade,


597
00:27:26.021 --> 00:27:28.289
prosecutors had
this corrupt alliance


598
00:27:28.323 --> 00:27:31.993
with jailhouse informants
who would either make up


599
00:27:32.027 --> 00:27:35.230
or try to solicit confessions
from fellow inmates


600
00:27:35.263 --> 00:27:38.366
and then use that information
to try to get


601
00:27:38.399 --> 00:27:41.302
some leniency on their own case,
their own sentence.


602
00:27:41.336 --> 00:27:45.506
There was a shift in my attorney
with the tape of Robert Hughes.


603
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.577
He gave up on me.
I saw it in his eyes.


604
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.579
I saw it in his eyes.

605
00:27:51.612 --> 00:27:55.583
[Susan] Bruce had been
incarcerated now for a year.


606
00:27:55.616 --> 00:27:58.954
As long as it's been,
which was incomprehensible to me


607
00:27:58.987 --> 00:28:02.924
that anybody could spend a day,
let alone close to a year


608
00:28:02.958 --> 00:28:05.293
behind bars for something
they didn't do,


609
00:28:05.326 --> 00:28:09.197
now I have another year to wait
potentially until my trial.


610
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.532
One of the times that I came
back up front, juvenile hall,


611
00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:13.634
when they were receiving me,
said, wait a minute,


612
00:28:13.668 --> 00:28:16.037
the date of birth here,
this guy's over 18.


613
00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:18.473
He can't associate
with other minors.


614
00:28:18.506 --> 00:28:23.044
Because Bruce is now an adult,
they put Bruce in the box,


615
00:28:23.078 --> 00:28:25.380
which means
solitary confinement.


616
00:28:30.118 --> 00:28:33.554
The statewide prisoner
hunger strike began 11 days ago


617
00:28:33.588 --> 00:28:36.491
as a protest over solitary
confinement conditions.


618
00:28:36.524 --> 00:28:40.261
And now more than 2,300 inmates
are refusing to eat.


619
00:28:40.295 --> 00:28:44.399
Solitary confinement
is a prison within a prison.


620
00:28:44.432 --> 00:28:46.667
You're locked in a 6-by-9 cell.

621
00:28:46.701 --> 00:28:49.971
Everything is made of concrete,
even the bed.


622
00:28:50.005 --> 00:28:52.307
You're locked in there

623
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.309
one hour out for recreation.

624
00:28:56.644 --> 00:28:59.747
You can be put into solitary
confinement for anything.


625
00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:03.251
You know, prison guard might
just get pissed off at you.


626
00:29:03.284 --> 00:29:05.686
[Matthew] Shane Bauer
is an American who was arrested


627
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.723
in Iran for accidentally
hiking across their border.


628
00:29:08.756 --> 00:29:10.558
They put him
in solitary confinement.


629
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:12.393
I would definitely say
that the situation


630
00:29:12.427 --> 00:29:14.029
in California is more extreme.

631
00:29:14.062 --> 00:29:15.563
The cells in California
are smaller


632
00:29:15.596 --> 00:29:17.598
than the cell
I was in in Iran.


633
00:29:17.632 --> 00:29:20.068
There's no windows
in the cells in California.


634
00:29:20.101 --> 00:29:22.703
The hole is considered torture

635
00:29:22.737 --> 00:29:26.607
by Amnesty International
and the United Nations.


636
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:28.643
This is Anthony Graves.

637
00:29:28.676 --> 00:29:30.611
He's an innocent man
who was wrongfully convicted


638
00:29:30.645 --> 00:29:33.681
and spent 16 years in solitary.

639
00:29:33.714 --> 00:29:37.518
No one can begin to imagine
the psychological effects


640
00:29:37.552 --> 00:29:39.454
isolation has
on another human being.


641
00:29:39.487 --> 00:29:43.491
95% of Americans
who spent time in solitary


642
00:29:43.524 --> 00:29:46.194
report developing
a serious psychiatric condition.


643
00:29:46.227 --> 00:29:49.297
Guys become paranoid,
schizophrenic,


644
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.499
and can't sleep because
they're hearing voices.


645
00:29:51.532 --> 00:29:56.237
You're more than five times
more likely to commit suicide.


646
00:29:56.271 --> 00:29:58.739
I was there when guys
were attempting suicide


647
00:29:58.773 --> 00:30:02.043
by cutting themselves,
trying to tie a sheet


648
00:30:02.077 --> 00:30:04.779
around their necks,
overdosing on their medication.


649
00:30:04.812 --> 00:30:08.149
In Iran I know of nobody
being in solitary confinement


650
00:30:08.183 --> 00:30:09.684
for more than two years,

651
00:30:09.717 --> 00:30:12.120
which is an extremely long
period of time.


652
00:30:12.153 --> 00:30:14.322
But in California
and Pelican Bay State prison,


653
00:30:14.355 --> 00:30:16.491
the average time
is seven and a half years.


654
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.533
[Susan]
For two years, Bruce had been
waiting for his trial.


655
00:30:25.566 --> 00:30:27.768
He'd gone over it in his head
day after day


656
00:30:27.802 --> 00:30:30.671
what the judge would say,
what a jury would think.


657
00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:32.707
When they heard
the transcript


658
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.243
of Detective Monsue's
interrogation of Mike Ryan,


659
00:30:35.276 --> 00:30:37.044
that's all they'd need to hear.

660
00:30:39.147 --> 00:30:41.682
All the lies,
all the inconsistencies,


661
00:30:41.716 --> 00:30:45.220
there would be no way
he wouldn't be found innocent.


662
00:30:45.253 --> 00:30:49.357
Except the prosecutor
filed a motion to deny Bruce


663
00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.092
the right to make any mention

664
00:30:51.126 --> 00:30:53.328
of Mike Ryan's name
at the trial.


665
00:30:53.361 --> 00:30:56.631
[Bruce]
On the grounds that we couldn't
tie Mike Ryan to the crime.


666
00:30:56.664 --> 00:30:58.633
The judge turns to my attorney,

667
00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:00.601
"What evidence do you have
that Mike Ryan is tied to this?"


668
00:31:00.635 --> 00:31:02.837
He says, "He was in the county.
He could have done it."


669
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.772
And the judge goes,
"Is that all you have?"


670
00:31:04.805 --> 00:31:07.175
Because he didn't take the time
to read the transcript.


671
00:31:07.208 --> 00:31:08.843
He was just on autopilot.

672
00:31:08.876 --> 00:31:11.179
He was not paying attention.
He wasn't engaged.


673
00:31:11.212 --> 00:31:13.314
He says, "Yeah,
that's it, that's all I have."


674
00:31:13.348 --> 00:31:16.151
We couldn't tie Mike Ryan
to the crime.


675
00:31:16.184 --> 00:31:17.818
That was the framework
for my trial.


676
00:31:17.852 --> 00:31:20.788
It is an absolute joke
the resources


677
00:31:20.821 --> 00:31:22.690
prosecutors have
versus defense attorneys.


678
00:31:22.723 --> 00:31:24.659
[Matthew] Justin Brooks
is the director


679
00:31:24.692 --> 00:31:26.727
of the California Innocence
Project,


680
00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:28.896
a nonprofit group dedicated
to helping


681
00:31:28.929 --> 00:31:31.599
wrongfully convicted Americans
get out of prison.


682
00:31:31.632 --> 00:31:35.470
Prosecutors have a police force
at their disposal


683
00:31:35.503 --> 00:31:37.405
as their investigators.

684
00:31:37.438 --> 00:31:40.708
They're-- they get the case
from the first moment


685
00:31:40.741 --> 00:31:42.410
it's being investigated.

686
00:31:42.443 --> 00:31:43.644
They have access
to all the people


687
00:31:43.678 --> 00:31:45.680
who are involved in that.

688
00:31:45.713 --> 00:31:49.217
Defense comes late to the date.
We are at a total disadvantage.


689
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.619
The sixth amendment
to the U.S. Constitution


690
00:31:51.652 --> 00:31:55.190
is supposed to guarantee
the right to effective counsel.


691
00:31:55.223 --> 00:31:58.259
But as we're seeing in America,
you have to buy your rights.


692
00:31:58.293 --> 00:32:01.596
You're more likely to walk free
if you're rich and guilty


693
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:03.731
then you are if you're poor
and innocent.


694
00:32:03.764 --> 00:32:07.502
[Bruce]
The evidence is Detective Monsue
telling his lies,


695
00:32:07.535 --> 00:32:11.939
Robert Hughes telling his lies,
and no alternate suspect.


696
00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:15.176
And so I'm screwed.

697
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.378
They're charging me
with first-degree murder,


698
00:32:17.412 --> 00:32:19.947
which carries 26 years to life
in state prison.


699
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.650
It's longer
than I'd been alive.


700
00:32:22.683 --> 00:32:25.253
A day and a half in,
my attorney comes to me


701
00:32:25.286 --> 00:32:26.954
in the holding tank and says,

702
00:32:26.987 --> 00:32:30.325
"The judge is willing
to entertain a guilty plea


703
00:32:30.358 --> 00:32:32.393
in exchange for
a youth authority sentence."


704
00:32:32.427 --> 00:32:34.795
I talk with my dad, I said,
"Guilty plea, what--


705
00:32:34.829 --> 00:32:36.664
you know, I'm not going to take
a guilty plea."


706
00:32:36.697 --> 00:32:38.633
And he said, "I-
- I hear you."

707
00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:41.236
And a close friend of my--
of the family,


708
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:44.339
my father's best friend,
comes to the juvenile hall


709
00:32:44.372 --> 00:32:46.707
and says, "You have to--
you have to accept this plea."


710
00:32:46.741 --> 00:32:48.609
I said, "No, I'm not going to
accept anything.


711
00:32:48.643 --> 00:32:50.545
I didn't do anything.
I'm not gonna you know--"


712
00:32:50.578 --> 00:32:52.513
And he says, "Look,"
and he pounds his hand down


713
00:32:52.547 --> 00:32:54.749
on the bench
that we're sitting on,


714
00:32:54.782 --> 00:32:56.951
and he goes, "They are going
to convict you


715
00:32:56.984 --> 00:33:00.555
of first fucking degree murder
unless you plead guilty."


716
00:33:00.588 --> 00:33:04.459
And he's practically crying,
as am I right now.


717
00:33:04.492 --> 00:33:06.961
He goes, "Look, do whatever
you have to do to get home."


718
00:33:06.994 --> 00:33:09.764
You are the law.

719
00:33:09.797 --> 00:33:12.400
The defendant is not guilty.

720
00:33:12.433 --> 00:33:14.835
No man is above the law.

721
00:33:14.869 --> 00:33:18.406
What we see on most TV shows
is not reality.


722
00:33:18.439 --> 00:33:20.841
Our justice system
isn't what you think it is.


723
00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:22.543
[Matthew]
Rolling Stone magazine


724
00:33:22.577 --> 00:33:24.679
considers Wayne Kramer
of The MC5


725
00:33:24.712 --> 00:33:27.648
one of the top 100 greatest
guitarists of all time.


726
00:33:27.682 --> 00:33:30.718
He battled drug addiction
and in 1975,


727
00:33:30.751 --> 00:33:33.621
went to prison for two years
for selling cocaine.


728
00:33:33.654 --> 00:33:36.257
He's since provided guitars
and taught music


729
00:33:36.291 --> 00:33:38.893
to inmates at over 50
correctional institutions


730
00:33:38.926 --> 00:33:40.461
throughout the United States.

731
00:33:40.495 --> 00:33:42.497
People think that,
you know,


732
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.732
you have a right to a trial
and everybody goes to trial


733
00:33:44.765 --> 00:33:47.802
and there's the good prosecutor
and the defense attorney,


734
00:33:47.835 --> 00:33:49.036
and they battle it out.

735
00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:50.738
That ain't the way it works.

736
00:33:50.771 --> 00:33:52.807
The way it works
is the prosecutors


737
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.411
stack up the charges on you
and force you to plead guilty


738
00:33:56.444 --> 00:33:59.514
to a lesser charge to keep
from doing life


739
00:33:59.547 --> 00:34:01.416
or double life or triple life.

740
00:34:01.449 --> 00:34:04.985
People don't get trials.
What they get is a deal.


741
00:34:05.019 --> 00:34:08.323
People suggest that anywhere
between, you know,


742
00:34:08.356 --> 00:34:12.327
three or 10 and 15%
of people behind bars


743
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.963
could be innocent of the crimes
of which they were charged.


744
00:34:15.996 --> 00:34:19.033
Michelle Alexander
is a civil rights lawyer,


745
00:34:19.066 --> 00:34:22.770
Stanford law professor and
the author of The New Jim Crow,


746
00:34:22.803 --> 00:34:24.972
one of the most highly
acclaimed studies


747
00:34:25.005 --> 00:34:26.741
of America's
criminal justice system.


748
00:34:26.774 --> 00:34:29.677
The reality is, is that
thousands of people


749
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:32.713
every year
in the United States


750
00:34:32.747 --> 00:34:36.384
wind up pleading guilty
to crimes


751
00:34:36.417 --> 00:34:37.852
they may not have committed

752
00:34:37.885 --> 00:34:41.856
because they are
either railroaded


753
00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.792
by police officers who give them
false information


754
00:34:44.825 --> 00:34:48.663
or coerce confessions
or because they were afraid


755
00:34:48.696 --> 00:34:52.800
of facing, you know, harsh
mandatory minimum sentences


756
00:34:52.833 --> 00:34:56.471
and believe that, you know,
their best chance


757
00:34:56.504 --> 00:34:57.905
is to just take a plea.

758
00:34:57.938 --> 00:34:59.474
You're an average Joe.

759
00:34:59.507 --> 00:35:01.041
You don't know anything about,

760
00:35:01.075 --> 00:35:02.677
the prison,
the politics in county jail.


761
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.445
You don't know anything.

762
00:35:04.479 --> 00:35:06.381
So they put you there
with these people,


763
00:35:06.414 --> 00:35:08.916
and this is how they force you
to take deals, you know.


764
00:35:08.949 --> 00:35:11.051
You're around people that you
see on the news that are,


765
00:35:11.085 --> 00:35:13.087
"Oh, those are horrible people,
and the same guy


766
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.989
you just saw on the news
is your bunkie.


767
00:35:15.022 --> 00:35:16.857
Of course
you're gonna take a deal.


768
00:35:16.891 --> 00:35:18.726
Get me away from these people.
This is the system.


769
00:35:18.759 --> 00:35:20.628
This is what they do to you.

770
00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:22.697
They understand that
if we put this guy in here,


771
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.532
if you did it or not,
it doesn't even matter


772
00:35:24.565 --> 00:35:26.667
because you're looking
at the end result.


773
00:35:26.701 --> 00:35:29.470
I can't take another fucking day
in this place.


774
00:35:29.504 --> 00:35:32.473
Whatever you say, I'll do.
So just let me out.


775
00:35:32.507 --> 00:35:34.875
Once you're arrested
and charged with a crime,


776
00:35:34.909 --> 00:35:37.478
understand you will be taking
a plea bargain


777
00:35:37.512 --> 00:35:39.046
nine out of 10 times.

778
00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:41.749
You have to.
The system is against you.


779
00:35:41.782 --> 00:35:43.884
The US justice system isn't
like any justice system


780
00:35:43.918 --> 00:35:47.588
in the world,
a system where 95% of the cases


781
00:35:47.622 --> 00:35:49.089
are resolved by plea bargain.

782
00:35:49.123 --> 00:35:50.958
You know,
it's no longer a trial system.


783
00:35:50.991 --> 00:35:52.727
It's a plea bargain system.

784
00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.631
If the enormous percentage
of defendants


785
00:35:56.664 --> 00:36:00.535
who plead guilty
suddenly one day said,


786
00:36:00.568 --> 00:36:03.804
"We're not pleading guilty,"

787
00:36:03.838 --> 00:36:06.541
the system
would grind to a halt.


788
00:36:06.574 --> 00:36:09.076
The court system
does not have the capacity


789
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:10.778
for the current number
of defendants


790
00:36:10.811 --> 00:36:12.447
that are passing through it.

791
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.881
The whole purpose
of plea bargains


792
00:36:13.914 --> 00:36:16.150
from the perspective
of a prosecutor


793
00:36:16.183 --> 00:36:17.585
raises his conviction rate.

794
00:36:17.618 --> 00:36:19.587
So prosecutors
typically have


795
00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.089
in the high-90 percentile
conviction rates,


796
00:36:22.122 --> 00:36:26.894
including those plea bargains
because of course,


797
00:36:26.927 --> 00:36:29.830
from a legal standpoint,
we know that nobody


798
00:36:29.864 --> 00:36:32.800
would ever plead guilty
to something they didn't do.


799
00:36:32.833 --> 00:36:35.503
And so, we agreed
that I would plead guilty


800
00:36:35.536 --> 00:36:37.905
in exchange for
a youth authority sentence.


801
00:36:37.938 --> 00:36:40.841
We went back into trial,
we entered the plea,


802
00:36:40.875 --> 00:36:42.977
and I went down
for a 90-day observation


803
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.112
at the youth authority
in Norwalk.


804
00:36:45.145 --> 00:36:47.982
The challenge is
if you're innocent


805
00:36:48.015 --> 00:36:50.918
and you plead guilty,
you better be a good liar.


806
00:36:50.951 --> 00:36:52.887
You go down there,
you talk to psychologists,


807
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.522
and they ask you,
"So, did you do it?"


808
00:36:54.555 --> 00:36:56.223
Well, you have to say yes

809
00:36:56.256 --> 00:36:57.592
because it has to be
consistent with everything.


810
00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:59.460
"Well, how'd you do it?"

811
00:36:59.494 --> 00:37:02.129
I didn't have adequate answers
for these questions.


812
00:37:02.162 --> 00:37:05.199
So, they didn't buy it,
in a sense.


813
00:37:05.232 --> 00:37:06.967
And, you know, rightly so.

814
00:37:07.001 --> 00:37:09.604
And they sent a report
that was dispositive,


815
00:37:09.637 --> 00:37:11.872
a negative report
back to the judge.


816
00:37:11.906 --> 00:37:14.074
And he said, "I didn't realize
that youth authority


817
00:37:14.108 --> 00:37:17.077
wouldn't be able to help you,
and so I'll allow you


818
00:37:17.111 --> 00:37:19.780
to take back your guilty plea
and go ahead with trial.


819
00:37:19.814 --> 00:37:22.016
Or I'll sentence you
to state prison right now."


820
00:37:22.049 --> 00:37:25.820
So that began
another period of waiting.


821
00:37:25.853 --> 00:37:27.988
[Susan] It would be well
over a year


822
00:37:28.022 --> 00:37:30.591
before Bruce would get
another trial date.


823
00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:33.193
23 hours a day in a cell
in isolation,


824
00:37:33.227 --> 00:37:35.863
no contact with other juveniles,
only counselors,


825
00:37:35.896 --> 00:37:39.667
one hour out for recreation.

826
00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.636
And while they might not be
able to introduce


827
00:37:41.669 --> 00:37:44.271
an alternate suspect,
Bruce demanded his lawyer


828
00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:49.109
knock down every argument
the prosecution could make.


829
00:37:49.143 --> 00:37:52.680
The prosecutor said Bruce could
not have seen his mother's body


830
00:37:52.713 --> 00:37:54.615
through the back window
of the house.


831
00:37:54.649 --> 00:37:56.584
The sun's reflection
in the glass


832
00:37:56.617 --> 00:37:58.753
and the furniture
would've blocked his view.


833
00:37:58.786 --> 00:38:01.055
His defense
was the crime scene pictures


834
00:38:01.088 --> 00:38:03.624
were taken
on a much sunnier day.


835
00:38:03.658 --> 00:38:06.260
The prosecution claimed
all the bloody footprints


836
00:38:06.293 --> 00:38:08.996
in the house
matched Bruce's shoes.


837
00:38:09.029 --> 00:38:10.965
Bruce's defense said
his fingerprints


838
00:38:10.998 --> 00:38:13.133
were not found anywhere
in the crime scene.


839
00:38:13.167 --> 00:38:15.903
There was no evidence
that he wiped anything down


840
00:38:15.936 --> 00:38:18.005
or made any attempt
to cover his tracks


841
00:38:18.038 --> 00:38:20.675
because Bruce
had nothing to hide.


842
00:38:20.708 --> 00:38:22.843
The prosecution
called Robert Hughes,


843
00:38:22.877 --> 00:38:25.813
who claimed Bruce confessed
in the 7000 module


844
00:38:25.846 --> 00:38:28.716
of county jail,
and the defense compared


845
00:38:28.749 --> 00:38:31.318
Robert Hughes
to a used car salesman


846
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:33.253
who wasn't to be trusted.

847
00:38:33.287 --> 00:38:36.624
Then, one day, they rapped
their keys on the door


848
00:38:36.657 --> 00:38:39.026
and they said,
"Lisker, it's a verdict."


849
00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:40.695
And my dad was there.

850
00:38:40.728 --> 00:38:42.196
He was there
just every court day,


851
00:38:42.229 --> 00:38:43.964
and he was right there
in the front row,


852
00:38:43.998 --> 00:38:47.034
and we were just, you know--
eye contact,


853
00:38:47.067 --> 00:38:49.269
but you can't really talk
because you're not allowed to--


854
00:38:49.303 --> 00:38:51.038
it's not a visit, you know,

855
00:38:51.071 --> 00:38:54.141
you're not allowed to visit
with your--


856
00:38:54.174 --> 00:38:58.913
But he was-- he was there,
and the jury comes in


857
00:38:58.946 --> 00:39:02.049
one by one, you know,
excruciatingly slow,


858
00:39:02.082 --> 00:39:05.953
sits down,
and the judge speaks.


859
00:39:05.986 --> 00:39:08.255
"Have you reached a verdict?"
"Yes, we have.


860
00:39:08.288 --> 00:39:11.992
In the matter of
People vs. Bruce Lisker,


861
00:39:12.026 --> 00:39:14.695
we the jury find
the defendant..."


862
00:39:14.729 --> 00:39:18.265
and they said "guilty."

863
00:39:18.298 --> 00:39:19.834
And it was just--

864
00:39:22.703 --> 00:39:25.039
the bottom literally fell out
of my world.


865
00:39:25.072 --> 00:39:27.775
That's it.
It's over, isn't it?


866
00:39:27.808 --> 00:39:29.109
It's my life.

867
00:39:35.883 --> 00:39:37.384
When you've been
falsely accused,


868
00:39:37.417 --> 00:39:41.021
your only hope
is for your attorney


869
00:39:41.055 --> 00:39:44.659
to directly challenge
the veracity of the police.


870
00:39:44.692 --> 00:39:47.161
My attorney seemed unwilling
to go that far.


871
00:39:47.194 --> 00:39:49.096
He never outright said,
"Isn't it true


872
00:39:49.129 --> 00:39:50.865
that you're just lying
about all of this?


873
00:39:50.898 --> 00:39:52.900
Here's the investigatory work
that I did


874
00:39:52.933 --> 00:39:54.769
that proves
that you're just a liar."


875
00:39:54.802 --> 00:39:56.904
And he never did that.

876
00:39:56.937 --> 00:39:59.674
[Matthew] And this
is part of a larger problem


877
00:39:59.707 --> 00:40:02.276
that David Sirota
calls the authority bias.


878
00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:05.179
Authority bias meaning
the government, an institution


879
00:40:05.212 --> 00:40:07.748
says somebody did something,
and they must've done it.


880
00:40:07.782 --> 00:40:10.384
And what's strange about it
is that this is a country


881
00:40:10.417 --> 00:40:12.352
that in one way
the American zeitgeist is,


882
00:40:12.386 --> 00:40:14.121
"I don't trust-- the government
can't do anything right.


883
00:40:14.154 --> 00:40:16.190
I don't trust anything
the government says."


884
00:40:16.223 --> 00:40:18.859
And yet at another level,
at the very same time


885
00:40:18.893 --> 00:40:21.295
that that's the dominant
rhetorical paradigm


886
00:40:21.328 --> 00:40:25.365
in our politics,
there is this authority bias


887
00:40:25.399 --> 00:40:28.736
where, when the government
accuses somebody of a crime


888
00:40:28.769 --> 00:40:32.106
or says somebody's a wrongdoer,
reflexively, millions


889
00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:34.241
and millions of Americans
think it must be true.


890
00:40:34.274 --> 00:40:36.010
- Am I free to go?
- No, you're not.


891
00:40:36.043 --> 00:40:37.411
Your freedom is secondary.

892
00:40:37.444 --> 00:40:39.213
You're not allowed
to be holding me.


893
00:40:39.246 --> 00:40:40.948
Would you like to be placed
under arrest?


894
00:40:40.981 --> 00:40:43.050
You're not allowed
to arrest me.


895
00:40:48.355 --> 00:40:52.426
In the 1960s, Yale University
psychologist Stanley Milgram


896
00:40:52.459 --> 00:40:55.162
ran an experiment to see how
often human beings


897
00:40:55.195 --> 00:40:57.798
would obey an authority figure
and follow orders,


898
00:40:57.832 --> 00:41:00.167
even if doing so
ran completely against


899
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.069
their personal code
of morality.


900
00:41:02.102 --> 00:41:04.004
How is it possible,
I asked myself,


901
00:41:04.038 --> 00:41:06.841
that ordinary people
who are courteous and decent


902
00:41:06.874 --> 00:41:10.945
in everyday life
can act callously, inhumanely,


903
00:41:10.978 --> 00:41:12.947
without any limitations
of conscious?


904
00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.049
450 volts.

905
00:41:15.082 --> 00:41:17.484
In Milgram's experiment,
participants were told


906
00:41:17.517 --> 00:41:20.855
by a scientist in uniform
to electrocute a subject


907
00:41:20.888 --> 00:41:24.792
for each wrong answer on a test
at ever increasing voltages.


908
00:41:24.825 --> 00:41:26.827
Are you all right?

909
00:41:26.861 --> 00:41:29.196
[man]
Please continue, teacher.


910
00:41:29.229 --> 00:41:31.932
- Do I keep giving him shocks?
- Continue.


911
00:41:31.966 --> 00:41:34.034
- I'm up to 390.
- Continue, please.


912
00:41:34.068 --> 00:41:36.170
[buzzer buzzes]

913
00:41:36.203 --> 00:41:40.040
The participants had no idea
the subjects were just actors.


914
00:41:40.074 --> 00:41:41.809
And although many protested,

915
00:41:41.842 --> 00:41:43.978
Milgram
found a strong majority,


916
00:41:44.011 --> 00:41:47.848
over 65% of participants
would shock the subject


917
00:41:47.882 --> 00:41:49.449
to the point of killing them

918
00:41:49.483 --> 00:41:52.252
if instructed
by an authority figure.


919
00:41:52.286 --> 00:41:54.922
- 330 volts.
- [lever clicks]


920
00:41:54.955 --> 00:41:57.424
[man screams]

921
00:41:57.457 --> 00:42:00.294
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!


922
00:42:00.327 --> 00:42:03.097
My heart's bothering me!
Let me out, I tell you!


923
00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.765
Let me out of here!

924
00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:06.200
You have no right
to hold me here!


925
00:42:06.233 --> 00:42:08.869
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!


926
00:42:08.903 --> 00:42:11.138
Milgram concluded
that very few people


927
00:42:11.171 --> 00:42:13.974
have the psychological capacity
to resist authority.


928
00:42:14.008 --> 00:42:16.176
[man] The way we have
the system set up,


929
00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:19.513
the policeman's uniform,
gun at their side, the badge,


930
00:42:19.546 --> 00:42:23.217
they're treated with the same
deference as our military.


931
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.020
It's like they're infallible.

932
00:42:26.053 --> 00:42:29.323
With judges, we drape them
in robes like priests


933
00:42:29.356 --> 00:42:31.892
and literally put them up
on a pedestal.


934
00:42:31.926 --> 00:42:33.894
The system hierarchy,
which has almost


935
00:42:33.928 --> 00:42:36.931
no real checks and balances,
no accountability--


936
00:42:36.964 --> 00:42:40.034
Or transparency, is so deeply
entrenched in our culture--


937
00:42:40.067 --> 00:42:42.336
Most people would never
even think to question it.


938
00:42:42.369 --> 00:42:44.338
We never see how flawed it is.

939
00:42:52.947 --> 00:42:56.250
How do we resist
the natural instinct to obey?


940
00:42:56.283 --> 00:42:58.819
Don't blindly trust
authority figures.


941
00:42:58.853 --> 00:43:01.288
If you're given an order
that feels questionable,


942
00:43:01.321 --> 00:43:03.057
check your conscience.

943
00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.292
The time to argue
with a police officer


944
00:43:05.325 --> 00:43:07.227
is not the side of the road.

945
00:43:07.261 --> 00:43:09.363
Pick your battles wisely.

946
00:43:09.396 --> 00:43:12.166
If you can challenge authority

947
00:43:12.199 --> 00:43:14.835
without risking more
than you're willing to lose


948
00:43:14.869 --> 00:43:17.404
and something feels wrong,
don't obey.


949
00:43:17.437 --> 00:43:19.273
Don't obey
even the smallest commands


950
00:43:19.306 --> 00:43:21.175
if you feel that they're wrong.

951
00:43:21.208 --> 00:43:23.043
The more that we accept
and obey, the more we become


952
00:43:23.077 --> 00:43:25.846
- blind followers.
- And now you're under control.


953
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.215
[Matthew] In a world
which is absolutely insane.


954
00:43:28.248 --> 00:43:30.450
To free ourselves
from this authoritarian system


955
00:43:30.484 --> 00:43:32.286
in which
we've now found ourselves


956
00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:34.088
is going to take
a massive effort.


957
00:43:34.121 --> 00:43:37.925
And if you're afraid, I get it.
Find an ally.


958
00:43:37.958 --> 00:43:39.559
Milgram's experiment told us

959
00:43:39.593 --> 00:43:41.896
there's is great
psychological power


960
00:43:41.929 --> 00:43:44.999
against authoritarianism
in groups.


961
00:43:49.003 --> 00:43:52.306
Unfortunately, these techniques
are not taught in school.


962
00:43:54.942 --> 00:43:57.144
[Bruce]
And so if you're innocent
and you find yourself in prison,


963
00:43:57.177 --> 00:43:59.479
it's hard to have
any hope at all.


964
00:44:02.516 --> 00:44:05.219
[Susan] A year later,
Mike Ryan robbed


965
00:44:05.252 --> 00:44:07.221
another woman at knife point

966
00:44:07.254 --> 00:44:10.024
and was sentenced
to six years for armed robbery.


967
00:44:10.057 --> 00:44:11.992
But other than Bruce
and his father,


968
00:44:12.026 --> 00:44:14.528
nobody had connected Mike Ryan
to the murder


969
00:44:14.561 --> 00:44:17.397
besides other inmates
like Jeff Deskovic,


970
00:44:17.431 --> 00:44:20.267
another wrongfully convicted
man trying to prove


971
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.502
his innocence and losing hope.

972
00:44:22.536 --> 00:44:25.505
I remember reading
about Bruce Lisker's case


973
00:44:25.539 --> 00:44:28.375
in the magazine
Justice Denied.


974
00:44:28.408 --> 00:44:30.177
They allow people who allege

975
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:32.146
that they've been
wrongfully convicted


976
00:44:32.179 --> 00:44:35.916
who have a plausible story
to write about their case


977
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.318
with the hope that more
public attention will come.


978
00:44:38.352 --> 00:44:42.022
When I read about Bruce's case,
it was reaffirming to me


979
00:44:42.056 --> 00:44:44.658
that I was on the right path

980
00:44:44.691 --> 00:44:48.262
because even though
he hadn't been exonerated,


981
00:44:48.295 --> 00:44:51.932
he was still looking for help,
he hadn't given up.


982
00:44:51.966 --> 00:44:55.535
[Matthew] You can't give up,
no matter how long it takes.


983
00:44:55.569 --> 00:44:58.272
And it could take a long time.

984
00:44:58.305 --> 00:45:00.074
One of the biggest factors
in why the US


985
00:45:00.107 --> 00:45:02.642
has the largest prison
population in the world


986
00:45:02.676 --> 00:45:05.279
is the length
of our prison sentences.


987
00:45:05.312 --> 00:45:08.715
The average sentence
for burglary in Canada


988
00:45:08.748 --> 00:45:11.085
and in England
is around six months.


989
00:45:11.118 --> 00:45:15.155
In the US,
it's around a year and a half.


990
00:45:15.189 --> 00:45:18.225
In other developed countries,
a drug offense might land you


991
00:45:18.258 --> 00:45:20.627
a year,
year and a half in jail.


992
00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.031
In the US,
it's five to ten years or more.


993
00:45:24.064 --> 00:45:25.665
If you're a black man
in America,


994
00:45:25.699 --> 00:45:28.602
your sentence
will be 20% longer


995
00:45:28.635 --> 00:45:32.206
than if you're a white man
for the exact same crime.


996
00:45:32.239 --> 00:45:35.542
The federal law still
holds marijuana


997
00:45:35.575 --> 00:45:39.746
as equal to heroin,
which is unfathomable.


998
00:45:39.779 --> 00:45:42.282
These bullshit laws
that are old


999
00:45:42.316 --> 00:45:46.053
and prehistoric
needs to be changed.


1000
00:45:46.086 --> 00:45:48.655
I met a woman that
had a first offense,


1001
00:45:48.688 --> 00:45:53.227
nothing more than $5 worth
of crack cocaine


1002
00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.163
and was sentenced to jail
in 1979


1003
00:45:56.196 --> 00:46:00.000
and didn't come home
until 2014.


1004
00:46:00.034 --> 00:46:02.036
And she said to me,

1005
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:04.404
"I don't know how
to use no phone.


1006
00:46:09.509 --> 00:46:14.048
I don't know how to send a text.
I don't know how to email."


1007
00:46:19.386 --> 00:46:21.121
I'm sorry.

1008
00:46:24.591 --> 00:46:26.526
High incarceration rates

1009
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.396
and longer than necessary
prison terms


1010
00:46:29.429 --> 00:46:31.598
have not played
a significant role


1011
00:46:31.631 --> 00:46:34.368
in materially improving
public safety,


1012
00:46:34.401 --> 00:46:37.437
reducing crime,
or strengthening communities.


1013
00:46:37.471 --> 00:46:40.207
In fact,
the opposite is often true.


1014
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.808
And as it turns out,

1015
00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:44.111
we've known this
for a long time.


1016
00:46:44.144 --> 00:46:47.181
In the 1970s,
criminologists had developed


1017
00:46:47.214 --> 00:46:50.684
this consensus that, you know,
prisons just didn't work.


1018
00:46:50.717 --> 00:46:54.321
But this consensus
was interrupted


1019
00:46:54.354 --> 00:46:58.125
by a political movement,
racial anxiety,


1020
00:46:58.158 --> 00:47:01.495
racial resentment, and also
to capitalize on, you know,


1021
00:47:01.528 --> 00:47:04.464
growing public fear as crime
rates were beginning to rise.


1022
00:47:04.498 --> 00:47:06.500
And, you know,
as politicians found


1023
00:47:06.533 --> 00:47:09.169
that this get-tough rhetoric,
you know, sold well


1024
00:47:09.203 --> 00:47:11.405
to the public,
all of the research and studies


1025
00:47:11.438 --> 00:47:13.407
that suggested that prisons
didn't work


1026
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.609
were shoved lightly
to the side,


1027
00:47:15.642 --> 00:47:17.577
and we went on
a prison-building boom


1028
00:47:17.611 --> 00:47:20.314
unlike anything the world
had ever seen before.


1029
00:47:20.347 --> 00:47:22.849
And this was compounded
by the war on drugs.


1030
00:47:22.882 --> 00:47:25.119
The drug war was born

1031
00:47:25.152 --> 00:47:28.555
with a particular group
of people in mind as the enemy.


1032
00:47:28.588 --> 00:47:31.191
We must wage what I have called
total war


1033
00:47:31.225 --> 00:47:34.694
against public enemy number one,
the problem of dangerous drugs.


1034
00:47:34.728 --> 00:47:37.831
Poor people, particularly,
black people


1035
00:47:37.864 --> 00:47:40.667
were defined as the enemy
in the war on drugs.


1036
00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.702
They were defined
that way politically


1037
00:47:42.736 --> 00:47:44.704
but also through media imagery.

1038
00:47:44.738 --> 00:47:46.873
[male reporter] The nation's
crack cocaine epidemic


1039
00:47:46.906 --> 00:47:48.775
is taking
a new and dangerous turn.


1040
00:47:48.808 --> 00:47:51.578
[Wayne] White people,
brown people, and black people


1041
00:47:51.611 --> 00:47:56.216
all use drugs
and sell drugs at the same rate.


1042
00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.486
But if we look at who's serving
time in America's prisons--


1043
00:47:59.519 --> 00:48:01.555
[Matthew] The law enforcement
apparatus


1044
00:48:01.588 --> 00:48:04.491
is deployed disproportionately
against people of color.


1045
00:48:04.524 --> 00:48:06.360
Oh, look at that.

1046
00:48:06.393 --> 00:48:09.463
And the war on drugs also bears
a major responsibility


1047
00:48:09.496 --> 00:48:11.865
for racial bias
in our prison system


1048
00:48:11.898 --> 00:48:14.668
as African-Americans
are arrested for drug offenses


1049
00:48:14.701 --> 00:48:18.572
at 10 times the rate of whites
and serve longer sentences.


1050
00:48:18.605 --> 00:48:22.309
Although people of color make
up only 30% of our populations,


1051
00:48:22.342 --> 00:48:24.644
they make up 60% of our prisons.

1052
00:48:24.678 --> 00:48:26.680
By the most
conservative estimates,


1053
00:48:26.713 --> 00:48:29.249
if we keep going
the way we're going,


1054
00:48:29.283 --> 00:48:31.551
one in four black men born today
will go to jail


1055
00:48:31.585 --> 00:48:33.420
at some point in their lifetime.

1056
00:48:33.453 --> 00:48:36.856
An estimated 5.3
million Americans are denied


1057
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:40.494
the right to vote based
on a past felony conviction.


1058
00:48:40.527 --> 00:48:43.730
And that impacts men of color
more than anyone else.


1059
00:48:43.763 --> 00:48:46.433
This has got to change.

1060
00:48:46.466 --> 00:48:50.237
You know, with any war,
there is some collateral damage,


1061
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:52.672
and although white people
may not have been


1062
00:48:52.706 --> 00:48:55.742
the original targets,
they may not have been


1063
00:48:55.775 --> 00:48:59.246
the inspiration for the war,

1064
00:48:59.279 --> 00:49:02.649
many white people,
particularly poor


1065
00:49:02.682 --> 00:49:06.886
and working-class white folks,
have found themselves swept in.


1066
00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.723
I'm very patriotic.
Love my country.


1067
00:49:09.756 --> 00:49:11.325
Not real happy
with my government,


1068
00:49:11.358 --> 00:49:12.892
but I love my country.

1069
00:49:12.926 --> 00:49:14.861
Paul Rickett
is a US Army veteran


1070
00:49:14.894 --> 00:49:16.863
who served in the Gulf War.

1071
00:49:16.896 --> 00:49:21.635
I was out like about three weeks
when I got busted for LSD.


1072
00:49:21.668 --> 00:49:23.937
I never sold acid.
I never made a dime off of acid.


1073
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.206
I took acid on the weekends.

1074
00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.542
I reimbursed my buddy
for what he paid for it


1075
00:49:28.575 --> 00:49:30.810
so that he wasn't giving it
to me for free.


1076
00:49:30.844 --> 00:49:32.779
If you want to call
that trafficking,


1077
00:49:32.812 --> 00:49:35.849
then I guess I'm a trafficker,
But it was personal use.


1078
00:49:35.882 --> 00:49:37.584
We would just fry
and play Frisbee


1079
00:49:37.617 --> 00:49:39.319
and listen to rock 'n' roll.

1080
00:49:39.353 --> 00:49:41.455
Drug offenses
are another major reason


1081
00:49:41.488 --> 00:49:44.458
for America's overflowing
prison population.


1082
00:49:44.491 --> 00:49:46.726
The US locks up more people
for drugs


1083
00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.828
than any other country
on the planet.


1084
00:49:48.862 --> 00:49:51.698
There are over
half a million Americans


1085
00:49:51.731 --> 00:49:54.000
locked up for drugs
on any given day,


1086
00:49:54.033 --> 00:49:55.869
and Paul was one of them.

1087
00:49:55.902 --> 00:49:57.671
He was facing a lot of time.

1088
00:49:57.704 --> 00:49:59.439
[Paul] Facing 10-year
mandatory minimum.


1089
00:49:59.473 --> 00:50:01.007
Then they offered him a deal.

1090
00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.609
For not forcing the government
to go through


1091
00:50:02.642 --> 00:50:04.411
the time and expense of trial.

1092
00:50:04.444 --> 00:50:06.780
All he had to do
was plead guilty.


1093
00:50:06.813 --> 00:50:10.450
And after some painful
consideration, I took it.


1094
00:50:10.484 --> 00:50:12.752
And after all those years
in prison,


1095
00:50:12.786 --> 00:50:14.621
one thing bothered Paul
the most.


1096
00:50:14.654 --> 00:50:16.390
You know, here we are
in this modern society


1097
00:50:16.423 --> 00:50:17.957
where we're a melting pot

1098
00:50:17.991 --> 00:50:20.394
and everybody's
getting along for the most part.


1099
00:50:20.427 --> 00:50:21.961
And then in prison,
you know,


1100
00:50:21.995 --> 00:50:23.397
it's completely the opposite,
you know.


1101
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:24.931
As soon as you get in there,

1102
00:50:24.964 --> 00:50:26.833
if you weren't a racist
when you went in,


1103
00:50:26.866 --> 00:50:28.868
they require you to be one
as soon as you get in.


1104
00:50:28.902 --> 00:50:31.004
Every single jail
and prison in America,


1105
00:50:31.037 --> 00:50:34.474
every one I've ever been to,
it's all divided up by race.


1106
00:50:34.508 --> 00:50:36.476
Everything's segregated
in there.


1107
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:39.313
You have the white phone,
and you have the Mexican phone,


1108
00:50:39.346 --> 00:50:41.748
and you have the black phone,
and you have the Asian phone.


1109
00:50:41.781 --> 00:50:44.484
It seems the racism that
helped spark the explosion


1110
00:50:44.518 --> 00:50:46.653
of America's prison system

1111
00:50:46.686 --> 00:50:49.423
still burns like a raging fire
within its walls


1112
00:50:49.456 --> 00:50:51.825
shamefully hidden
from the public eye.


1113
00:50:51.858 --> 00:50:54.761
[Bruce] It was a very strict
code of,


1114
00:50:54.794 --> 00:50:57.297
depending on your race,
this is what we do.


1115
00:50:57.331 --> 00:51:01.901
Even the prison guards
promote this.


1116
00:51:01.935 --> 00:51:05.439
Some people theorize
that it's a way for the guards


1117
00:51:05.472 --> 00:51:09.042
to keep control over us
because if we all got along,


1118
00:51:09.075 --> 00:51:12.446
then who would really
be running the prison?


1119
00:51:12.479 --> 00:51:13.980
Us or the guards?

1120
00:51:14.013 --> 00:51:15.682
There's one guard
for every 100 guys.


1121
00:51:15.715 --> 00:51:17.784
Prison society
is further divided


1122
00:51:17.817 --> 00:51:19.786
from race into gangs.

1123
00:51:19.819 --> 00:51:21.921
So it helps
to either be in one


1124
00:51:21.955 --> 00:51:23.857
or be from
the right neighborhood.


1125
00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.326
On my ride to prison,
the guy that was next to me,


1126
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.495
he was just a regular dude
from Long Beach.


1127
00:51:28.528 --> 00:51:30.330
He played basketball
at Poly high school.


1128
00:51:30.364 --> 00:51:31.798
He was a regular dude.
He had a flat top.


1129
00:51:31.831 --> 00:51:33.767
You know what I mean,
and, you know,


1130
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.437
he was going to prison for--
he had took a deal for--


1131
00:51:37.471 --> 00:51:39.873
I believe
it was like spousal abuse.


1132
00:51:39.906 --> 00:51:41.775
Him and his girl--
it was a terrorist threat.


1133
00:51:41.808 --> 00:51:44.478
In the United States,
a terrorist threat


1134
00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:46.713
covers any statement
that contains


1135
00:51:46.746 --> 00:51:49.015
the threat of violence
against another person.


1136
00:51:49.048 --> 00:51:51.851
In this case, Reggie is talking
about an argument a man


1137
00:51:51.885 --> 00:51:54.053
was having with his girlfriend
where he threatened her.


1138
00:51:54.087 --> 00:51:55.922
He told her he was gonna
beat her ass


1139
00:51:55.955 --> 00:51:57.657
or whatever it was,
it was a terrorist threat.


1140
00:51:57.691 --> 00:51:59.125
There was no physical violence
or anything,


1141
00:51:59.158 --> 00:52:01.027
but he took a deal
for 18 months,


1142
00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.029
and he was only supposed
to do like eight months.


1143
00:52:03.062 --> 00:52:05.665
You take a deal for 18 months,
you're gonna do five or 10.


1144
00:52:05.699 --> 00:52:07.401
So he fell for the bullshit.

1145
00:52:07.434 --> 00:52:08.835
The first night we got there,

1146
00:52:08.868 --> 00:52:10.504
they ask who's
from South Central.


1147
00:52:10.537 --> 00:52:12.539
I'm from South Central.
Where you from?


1148
00:52:12.572 --> 00:52:14.708
Explain to them where I'm from.
Your homeboys are over here.


1149
00:52:14.741 --> 00:52:16.876
They're gonna direct you
where you're supposed to go.


1150
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:18.778
This guy,
he didn't have anybody.


1151
00:52:18.812 --> 00:52:20.614
He was just from Long Beach,
you know?


1152
00:52:20.647 --> 00:52:22.949
He just was a regular dude,
you know?


1153
00:52:22.982 --> 00:52:25.485
And that night I'm on my bunk,

1154
00:52:25.519 --> 00:52:27.654
and I'm listening
to what's going on and I'm--


1155
00:52:27.687 --> 00:52:29.423
at first,
I thought they were playing


1156
00:52:29.456 --> 00:52:30.657
because that's what
it started off


1157
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:32.526
was this is the whole gimmick.

1158
00:52:32.559 --> 00:52:35.495
Everything is a ploy
to lead to something else.


1159
00:52:35.529 --> 00:52:37.531
That's why they
tell you don't let anybody


1160
00:52:37.564 --> 00:52:39.165
touch you in jail,
and he didn't know this.


1161
00:52:39.198 --> 00:52:40.867
He didn't understand
that you're not supposed


1162
00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.469
to wrestle with somebody
in the cell


1163
00:52:42.502 --> 00:52:44.538
because this is what
they're doing,


1164
00:52:44.571 --> 00:52:46.873
trying to see if they can get
you in a vulnerable position


1165
00:52:46.906 --> 00:52:48.708
I'm on my bunk,
and I'm listening to it,


1166
00:52:48.742 --> 00:52:50.644
and I'm thinking, damn,
ain't somebody


1167
00:52:50.677 --> 00:52:52.979
gonna come help this dude?

1168
00:52:53.012 --> 00:52:54.781
I mean, and they didn't.

1169
00:52:54.814 --> 00:52:58.452
That night in his cell,
they raped him.


1170
00:52:58.485 --> 00:53:01.120
[Matthew] According
to the Department of Justice,


1171
00:53:01.154 --> 00:53:04.424
nearly one in 10 prisoners
suffer sexual abuse


1172
00:53:04.458 --> 00:53:06.726
while in American jails
and prisons.


1173
00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.463
A quarter of those
also reported serious injury


1174
00:53:09.496 --> 00:53:12.932
like chipped or lost teeth,
being knocked unconscious,


1175
00:53:12.966 --> 00:53:15.502
broken bones, or worse.

1176
00:53:15.535 --> 00:53:18.538
So let's keep that in mind
the next time a talk show host,


1177
00:53:18.572 --> 00:53:20.874
a government official,
or anybody


1178
00:53:20.907 --> 00:53:23.142
makes a joke about prison rape.

1179
00:53:23.176 --> 00:53:25.579
The fact that we find
these jokes acceptable


1180
00:53:25.612 --> 00:53:28.682
shows just how far we've gone
in normalizing rape


1181
00:53:28.715 --> 00:53:31.184
as a just punishment
for any offense.


1182
00:53:31.217 --> 00:53:33.920
As long as we keep imagining
that people in prison


1183
00:53:33.953 --> 00:53:36.189
are subhuman,
that they're predatory


1184
00:53:36.222 --> 00:53:38.224
and incorrigible
and nothing like you and me,


1185
00:53:38.257 --> 00:53:41.160
why would we lose any sleep
about what their lives are like


1186
00:53:41.194 --> 00:53:42.762
or what's happening to them?

1187
00:53:42.796 --> 00:53:45.699
There are now over 5,000 jails

1188
00:53:45.732 --> 00:53:47.567
and prisons
in the United States,


1189
00:53:47.601 --> 00:53:51.070
more than we have colleges
and universities.


1190
00:53:51.104 --> 00:53:53.773
In many parts of America,
particularly the South,


1191
00:53:53.807 --> 00:53:56.109
there are more people
living in prisons


1192
00:53:56.142 --> 00:53:58.044
then on college campuses

1193
00:53:58.077 --> 00:54:01.581
and a multi-billion-dollar
business has emerged.


1194
00:54:03.249 --> 00:54:05.184
Brace yourself.

1195
00:54:05.218 --> 00:54:08.221
This is going to sound
too barbaric to be real,


1196
00:54:08.254 --> 00:54:12.626
like medieval times,
a science-fiction horror film,


1197
00:54:12.659 --> 00:54:14.894
or a French
historical musical.


1198
00:54:14.928 --> 00:54:17.230
The 13th amendment
of the Constitution


1199
00:54:17.263 --> 00:54:20.199
outlawed slavery,
but it still allows


1200
00:54:20.233 --> 00:54:23.737
for forced labor
if you're in prison.


1201
00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:27.106
Today, there are roughly

1202
00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:30.777
working for corporations
and in government industries.


1203
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:32.879
There is no minimum wage,

1204
00:54:32.912 --> 00:54:35.615
so you could make as little
as a few cents an hour.


1205
00:54:35.649 --> 00:54:37.984
Bruce worked
in the kitchen for years


1206
00:54:38.017 --> 00:54:41.621
then in clerical jobs making
a maximum of 32 cents an hour.


1207
00:54:41.655 --> 00:54:45.525
It sounds like another time
or a Coen Brothers movie


1208
00:54:45.559 --> 00:54:47.293
but it's happening right now.

1209
00:54:47.326 --> 00:54:50.697
There are no benefits,
no organizing, and no strikes.


1210
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:54.233
And if you refuse to work,
you can get put in the hole.


1211
00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:00.874
This is big business for state
and for-profit prisons


1212
00:55:00.907 --> 00:55:05.211
who sell inmate labor
to Fortune 500's like Chevron,


1213
00:55:05.244 --> 00:55:09.549
Bank of America, AT&T,
and the US military.


1214
00:55:09.583 --> 00:55:12.085
Nearly half the population
in prison


1215
00:55:12.118 --> 00:55:15.154
make military uniforms,
body armor, helmets,


1216
00:55:15.188 --> 00:55:17.724
and provide labor
as subcontractors


1217
00:55:17.757 --> 00:55:19.726
for Fortune 500s.

1218
00:55:22.696 --> 00:55:25.932
They make office furniture,
man call centers,


1219
00:55:25.965 --> 00:55:29.168
take hotel reservations,
work in slaughterhouses.


1220
00:55:29.202 --> 00:55:34.240
or manufacture textiles, shoes,
and clothing for pennies.


1221
00:55:34.273 --> 00:55:37.276
Prison labor
is part of why some state


1222
00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:41.047
and private prisons yield
a multibillion-dollar profit.


1223
00:55:43.016 --> 00:55:45.685
Not only are prisoners
used to make products,


1224
00:55:45.719 --> 00:55:48.588
prisoners themselves
are sold as products.


1225
00:55:48.622 --> 00:55:50.289
Since the 1980s,

1226
00:55:50.323 --> 00:55:52.592
the prison population
has boomed.


1227
00:55:52.626 --> 00:55:56.362
Now, 150 private prisons
are paid billions


1228
00:55:56.395 --> 00:55:58.698
by state governments
to house prisoners.


1229
00:55:58.732 --> 00:56:01.901
Private prisons do so well,
some of their biggest investors


1230
00:56:01.935 --> 00:56:05.639
are banks like Wells Fargo
or Bank of America.


1231
00:56:05.672 --> 00:56:10.677
Many private prisons demand

1232
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:14.013
meaning the taxpayer
foots the bill for every bed,


1233
00:56:14.047 --> 00:56:15.849
even the fucking empty ones.

1234
00:56:15.882 --> 00:56:19.152
For-profit prisons
are incentivized


1235
00:56:19.185 --> 00:56:22.321
to incarcerate more people
and for longer periods of time


1236
00:56:22.355 --> 00:56:25.391
to fill their quotas,
and to make sure that happens,


1237
00:56:25.424 --> 00:56:29.128
they spend millions pushing
tough-on-crime bills.


1238
00:56:29.162 --> 00:56:32.098
Today, nearly 10%
of America's prisoners


1239
00:56:32.131 --> 00:56:34.100
are held in private prisons.

1240
00:56:34.133 --> 00:56:38.104
They also spend millions
influencing immigration law.


1241
00:56:38.137 --> 00:56:40.940
Half of detained immigrants
are held in private prisons


1242
00:56:40.974 --> 00:56:43.943
for indefinite periods of time,
often years,


1243
00:56:43.977 --> 00:56:45.912
exposed to brutal conditions.

1244
00:56:45.945 --> 00:56:47.647
and because
they're not Americans,


1245
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:49.749
the government
gives them no right


1246
00:56:49.783 --> 00:56:53.753
to even the most basic legal
representation or medical care.


1247
00:56:53.787 --> 00:56:56.690
The prisons
are private companies.


1248
00:56:56.723 --> 00:57:02.161
Why would they want
to decrease violence, okay?


1249
00:57:02.195 --> 00:57:03.863
Why would they want to improve

1250
00:57:03.897 --> 00:57:06.900
the quality of life
of these people?


1251
00:57:06.933 --> 00:57:09.703
And then we call it justice,
okay?


1252
00:57:09.736 --> 00:57:12.672
It's blood money.
It's bad karma.


1253
00:57:12.706 --> 00:57:15.341
It's going to come back
and haunt us


1254
00:57:15.374 --> 00:57:17.877
to the point of extinction.

1255
00:57:17.911 --> 00:57:20.346
[male reporter]
Three housing facilities
were set on fire.


1256
00:57:20.379 --> 00:57:22.982
It apparently all started
over inmate frustration


1257
00:57:23.016 --> 00:57:24.951
over the quality
of medical care.


1258
00:57:24.984 --> 00:57:26.319
[Matthew]
Perhaps needless to say,


1259
00:57:26.352 --> 00:57:28.287
being treated like chattel

1260
00:57:28.321 --> 00:57:30.256
and used as forced labor
for pennies an hour


1261
00:57:30.289 --> 00:57:32.759
is not that popular
on the inside,


1262
00:57:32.792 --> 00:57:34.894
but that's not the worst of it.

1263
00:57:34.928 --> 00:57:36.462
The socks
they issue you are used.


1264
00:57:36.495 --> 00:57:39.065
The underwear
they issue you is used.


1265
00:57:39.098 --> 00:57:41.467
You gotta buy things
like shaving equipment


1266
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:45.839
and food and sweats and socks,
underwear, T-shirts.


1267
00:57:45.872 --> 00:57:49.075
The canteen, or commissary,
is more expensive


1268
00:57:49.108 --> 00:57:51.244
than any convenience store
on the outside.


1269
00:57:51.277 --> 00:57:53.279
It's definitely advisable
to have money


1270
00:57:53.312 --> 00:57:54.914
so that you can get started.

1271
00:57:54.948 --> 00:57:56.916
If you don't have 50
to 100 bucks


1272
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:59.052
coming into your books
or your account every month,


1273
00:57:59.085 --> 00:58:00.854
then you're gonna need a hustle.

1274
00:58:03.489 --> 00:58:06.025
This is Philip.
He was convicted of robbery.


1275
00:58:06.059 --> 00:58:09.428
As crooked as we are out here,

1276
00:58:09.462 --> 00:58:11.230
we're as crooked
inside there, too.


1277
00:58:11.264 --> 00:58:14.100
Whether it's drugs,
whether it's alcohol.


1278
00:58:14.133 --> 00:58:15.869
You got people
that they don't drink,


1279
00:58:15.902 --> 00:58:18.337
but they manufacture
prune-o all day.


1280
00:58:18.371 --> 00:58:20.106
In San Quentin

1281
00:58:20.139 --> 00:58:22.008
in the boiler room,
they found a still.


1282
00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:24.043
Friends that I knew
had actually gotten so far


1283
00:58:24.077 --> 00:58:26.145
as to, like,
get the copper tubing


1284
00:58:26.179 --> 00:58:29.148
from industries over,
and so we had copper tubing.


1285
00:58:29.182 --> 00:58:32.018
[Phillip] They were making
moonshine in San Quentin.


1286
00:58:32.051 --> 00:58:33.452
[Bruce] Mainly they drank it.

1287
00:58:33.486 --> 00:58:36.155
Did I have a hustle?
Sold drugs.


1288
00:58:36.189 --> 00:58:38.291
Through our visits
through a correctional officer.


1289
00:58:38.324 --> 00:58:41.460
Prison is like a networking
college for criminals.


1290
00:58:41.494 --> 00:58:43.863
[Phillip] The majority
of the guys in prison are there


1291
00:58:43.897 --> 00:58:45.899
trying to learn
how to do crime better.


1292
00:58:45.932 --> 00:58:48.234
This is just kind of a school

1293
00:58:48.267 --> 00:58:51.170
for criminals
to learn more to be criminals.


1294
00:58:51.204 --> 00:58:53.039
And that's not an exaggeration.

1295
00:58:53.072 --> 00:58:55.909
A 2011 study
from Ohio University


1296
00:58:55.942 --> 00:58:59.312
showed that after
spending time in prison,


1297
00:58:59.345 --> 00:59:02.181
those continuing to engage
in crime


1298
00:59:02.215 --> 00:59:04.951
see their criminal earnings
increase


1299
00:59:04.984 --> 00:59:08.988
on an average
by $11,000 a year.


1300
00:59:09.022 --> 00:59:11.557
Jody Lewen
is the executive director


1301
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.559
of the Prison University
Project.


1302
00:59:13.592 --> 00:59:16.162
There are thousands
and thousands of people


1303
00:59:16.195 --> 00:59:17.797
in the system.

1304
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:19.498
All they want
is the opportunity


1305
00:59:19.532 --> 00:59:22.168
to get a good education
and to be hired by somebody


1306
00:59:22.201 --> 00:59:25.304
where they can have a job
where they have meaningful work


1307
00:59:25.338 --> 00:59:26.806
and a livable wage.

1308
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.875
In the late '80s, early '90s.

1309
00:59:28.908 --> 00:59:32.846
there were probably 350 programs
in the prison system nationwide.


1310
00:59:32.879 --> 00:59:34.513
[Bruce] I took my dad's advice,
he'd been saying


1311
00:59:34.547 --> 00:59:36.215
for a long time, "Look
for some computer training.


1312
00:59:36.249 --> 00:59:37.583
Is there any computer training
in there?"


1313
00:59:37.616 --> 00:59:39.252
Because he knows, you know?

1314
00:59:39.285 --> 00:59:41.054
Finally,
when I get to San Quentin,


1315
00:59:41.087 --> 00:59:42.889
I said, "Do you have
any computer training?"


1316
00:59:42.922 --> 00:59:46.125
It was great because I mean,

1317
00:59:46.159 --> 00:59:48.394
those who know the least
obey the best, you know?


1318
00:59:48.427 --> 00:59:50.997
And there's this rebellious
kind of a spirit in there.


1319
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:53.967
They have you under their thumb
up and to the point


1320
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.970
of being able to put a bullet
in your head if they wanted to.


1321
00:59:57.003 --> 00:59:59.305
Stand still and be quiet.
Face that wall right now.


1322
00:59:59.338 --> 01:00:02.208
So there's this rebelliousness.
I could exercise my brain.


1323
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:04.110
They can't stop me
from doing that.


1324
01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:06.579
And so we really got this pride
about our education,


1325
01:00:06.612 --> 01:00:08.481
particularly in
that computer programming class,


1326
01:00:08.514 --> 01:00:11.851
and it was an honor
to be able to fight the system,


1327
01:00:11.885 --> 01:00:17.056
as you might say,
by educating each other.


1328
01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:20.393
And then seeing me graduate
that eight years later,


1329
01:00:20.426 --> 01:00:22.028
my dad was really proud of me.

1330
01:00:22.061 --> 01:00:24.030
And our relationship
just blossomed,


1331
01:00:24.063 --> 01:00:27.533
just became
so deep and so meaningful.


1332
01:00:27.566 --> 01:00:30.436
My dad was everything to me.

1333
01:00:30.469 --> 01:00:33.372
And it was just about two weeks
after I graduated


1334
01:00:33.406 --> 01:00:35.141
that he died.

1335
01:00:43.316 --> 01:00:44.884
Sorry.

1336
01:00:44.918 --> 01:00:48.287
* Oh, let us stay

1337
01:00:48.321 --> 01:00:50.990
* Stay true

1338
01:00:51.024 --> 01:00:54.327
* May we love and listen

1339
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.430
* And hear our hearts sing

1340
01:00:57.463 --> 01:01:00.366
* And keep on giving

1341
01:01:00.399 --> 01:01:05.338
* And may we stay true,
let us stay... *


1342
01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:09.242
When I sign this crime bill,
we together


1343
01:01:09.275 --> 01:01:13.346
are taking a big step toward
bringing the laws of our land


1344
01:01:13.379 --> 01:01:16.349
back into line
with the values of our people.


1345
01:01:16.382 --> 01:01:19.618
In 1994, Congress passed
the Violent Crime Control


1346
01:01:19.652 --> 01:01:22.555
and Law Enforcement Act,
which, among many other things,


1347
01:01:22.588 --> 01:01:25.124
barred people in prison
from receiving Pell grants.


1348
01:01:25.158 --> 01:01:27.660
Most of those programs folded
almost overnight.


1349
01:01:27.693 --> 01:01:30.096
To be realistic, I mean,
unless you're getting


1350
01:01:30.129 --> 01:01:31.630
a college education in here,

1351
01:01:31.664 --> 01:01:33.666
it's probably not gonna
help you too much.


1352
01:01:33.699 --> 01:01:36.035
But if they have skills
such as welding--


1353
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:38.938
welding, on this yard
is just phenomenal.


1354
01:01:38.972 --> 01:01:41.107
We've seen guys go through
the welding program,


1355
01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.543
and they're making 30, $40
an hour out there on the streets


1356
01:01:44.577 --> 01:01:47.480
and they're writing letters back
to the instructor over here.


1357
01:01:47.513 --> 01:01:49.983
Those are the things
that these guys need.


1358
01:01:50.016 --> 01:01:52.551
They need jobs
so they won't be robbing,


1359
01:01:52.585 --> 01:01:54.720
stealing, turning to the dope,
you know,


1360
01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:57.156
doing the drugs
and that type of thing.


1361
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:59.425
So, that's--
that's what I would change.


1362
01:01:59.458 --> 01:02:01.627
Critical reason number one
why people


1363
01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.497
are ending up in prison
is for lack of, really,


1364
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:06.432
quality educational
opportunity.


1365
01:02:06.465 --> 01:02:08.734
Since 1970,
in the state of California,


1366
01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:11.704
we've built 22 prisons
and one university.


1367
01:02:11.737 --> 01:02:14.440
We literally have more faith
in punishing people


1368
01:02:14.473 --> 01:02:17.543
and controlling them violently
than teaching them.


1369
01:02:17.576 --> 01:02:21.447
Let's imagine a parent
who raised a child like that.


1370
01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.483
What would we say about them?
What would we think of them?


1371
01:02:24.517 --> 01:02:28.054
We'd think of them as the most
unfit parent imaginable.


1372
01:02:28.087 --> 01:02:30.323
Ironically,
we might even call the police.


1373
01:02:30.356 --> 01:02:33.292
[sobbing]

1374
01:02:33.326 --> 01:02:34.994
[Bruce] By not having
an education,


1375
01:02:35.028 --> 01:02:36.729
by not having programs,

1376
01:02:36.762 --> 01:02:39.365
by not having positive things
for the guys to do.


1377
01:02:39.398 --> 01:02:42.068
It's really about terror
and intimidation


1378
01:02:42.101 --> 01:02:44.403
and people basically
fighting for survival


1379
01:02:44.437 --> 01:02:46.305
and often committing
extraordinary violence


1380
01:02:46.339 --> 01:02:48.674
in order to protect themselves
or to stay safe.


1381
01:02:48.707 --> 01:02:51.277
[Tim] It's kind of like
the weak dog in the pack.


1382
01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:54.447
If others spot weakness,
they're gonna pounce on you


1383
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.315
for a couple of reasons.

1384
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:57.750
You pounce on that guy,

1385
01:02:57.783 --> 01:02:59.685
that gives you
a little more status.


1386
01:02:59.718 --> 01:03:03.289
So, I had to ask myself,
are you gonna be a victim?


1387
01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:05.358
No, I ain't gonna be a victim.

1388
01:03:05.391 --> 01:03:08.461
Well, that really only left me
one choice in my mind.


1389
01:03:08.494 --> 01:03:10.629
That means I gotta be
the victimizer.


1390
01:03:19.805 --> 01:03:24.577
At some point, for some reason,
might be legitimate,


1391
01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:26.579
might not be,
someone's gonna test you.


1392
01:03:32.418 --> 01:03:35.288
Even if you lose, you're gonna
have to stand up for yourself.


1393
01:03:40.459 --> 01:03:42.228
A guy comes over,
and it's your day


1394
01:03:42.261 --> 01:03:44.130
to get your package,
and he tries to take


1395
01:03:44.163 --> 01:03:46.732
your package from you
that your people sent you,


1396
01:03:46.765 --> 01:03:48.634
if you let him do it,
there's gonna be


1397
01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:51.504
10 other dudes,
"Oh, yeah, he let that guy


1398
01:03:51.537 --> 01:03:53.406
take his package,
I'm gonna go get his TV,"


1399
01:03:53.439 --> 01:03:56.375
right down the line
until somebody's after your ass.


1400
01:03:56.409 --> 01:03:58.043
And that's not good.

1401
01:04:00.779 --> 01:04:02.781
But if you stand up
that first time


1402
01:04:02.815 --> 01:04:04.650
and they see you'll stand up
for yourself,


1403
01:04:04.683 --> 01:04:07.253
even if you lose,
people will respect that.


1404
01:04:11.224 --> 01:04:12.758
"Oh, don't mess with him.
There's easier prey."


1405
01:04:12.791 --> 01:04:14.693
"Yeah, but I can get him."
Doesn't matter.


1406
01:04:14.727 --> 01:04:16.462
Don't mess with him.

1407
01:04:16.495 --> 01:04:18.364
Why do you have to go
and get that guy


1408
01:04:18.397 --> 01:04:20.299
and get a couple lumps for it
when he can go get


1409
01:04:20.333 --> 01:04:24.803
that guy's stuff over there,
don't cost you nothing.


1410
01:04:24.837 --> 01:04:26.872
It usually only has to happen
once or twice


1411
01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:29.375
but just as importantly

1412
01:04:29.408 --> 01:04:32.811
that you didn't go
to the man for help...


1413
01:04:32.845 --> 01:04:34.513
you're gonna be all right.

1414
01:04:34.547 --> 01:04:36.482
Now if you're suddenly
thinking,


1415
01:04:36.515 --> 01:04:39.552
this isn't so bad, a black eye,
a few scratches,


1416
01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:41.554
and you're in the clear,
think again.


1417
01:04:41.587 --> 01:04:43.389
The American public in general
has been


1418
01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:46.759
so profoundly brainwashed
into thinking


1419
01:04:46.792 --> 01:04:49.595
that what we're doing
with our prison system


1420
01:04:49.628 --> 01:04:51.830
is somehow normal

1421
01:04:51.864 --> 01:04:57.170
or rational or... just,

1422
01:04:57.203 --> 01:04:59.605
I find that overwhelming
and exhausting just--


1423
01:04:59.638 --> 01:05:02.641
because the more you
spend time in--


1424
01:05:02.675 --> 01:05:04.677
inside and the more contact
you have with people


1425
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:06.445
who've been directly affected,

1426
01:05:06.479 --> 01:05:09.348
the more depraved
the system appears.


1427
01:05:09.382 --> 01:05:13.619
Over 20%,
one out of every five inmates,


1428
01:05:13.652 --> 01:05:16.422
are physically attacked
every six months.


1429
01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:18.157
I wasn't in San Quentin a week,

1430
01:05:18.191 --> 01:05:20.426
and I watched a man die
right next to me.


1431
01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:23.929
I watched two guys just walk up
and just stab him to death.


1432
01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:28.434
Part of me
wanted to scream in fear.


1433
01:05:29.768 --> 01:05:31.604
But I had a bigger fear of,
man,


1434
01:05:31.637 --> 01:05:33.439
what would these guys
think about me?


1435
01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:35.774
So I pretended like,
man, this ain't nothing.


1436
01:05:35.808 --> 01:05:37.676
I wanted
these people's acceptance.


1437
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:39.412
They tell me,
"You know how to make a knife?


1438
01:05:39.445 --> 01:05:42.248
Stab that guy there."
And I did.


1439
01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:44.817
So instead of getting
a traditional education


1440
01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:47.220
or job training,
prison's a great place


1441
01:05:47.253 --> 01:05:50.189
to learn how to make a knife
by dropping a razor blade


1442
01:05:50.223 --> 01:05:51.890
onto the melted end
of the toothbrush.


1443
01:05:51.924 --> 01:05:54.527
[Jody] What happens
when you have vast numbers


1444
01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.395
of people
in a system like that


1445
01:05:56.429 --> 01:05:59.732
or in a location like that
who have medical needs,


1446
01:05:59.765 --> 01:06:02.268
mental health needs,
educational needs,


1447
01:06:02.301 --> 01:06:05.538
substance abuse,
all of these things.


1448
01:06:05.571 --> 01:06:07.873
and there's nobody who really
knows how to handle that,


1449
01:06:07.906 --> 01:06:10.309
so violence itself
is often a failure


1450
01:06:10.343 --> 01:06:13.346
of communication
or alternatives for coping.


1451
01:06:13.379 --> 01:06:15.648
There are all sorts
of complex social pressures


1452
01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:18.517
on people to be violent
in prison.


1453
01:06:18.551 --> 01:06:20.686
So a lot of the violence
you see in prison is not


1454
01:06:20.719 --> 01:06:22.688
an expression of the character
of the people in prison,


1455
01:06:22.721 --> 01:06:24.623
it's people reacting
to the situation.


1456
01:06:24.657 --> 01:06:26.659
And this is something
so few people understand.


1457
01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:29.895
If you took 1,000 people
off the street and put them


1458
01:06:29.928 --> 01:06:32.731
at Corcoran or Pelican Bay
or Soledad...


1459
01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:39.004
some huge number of them
would end up committing violence


1460
01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:42.275
because of the situation
that they've been placed in.


1461
01:06:42.308 --> 01:06:45.544
Five years into his sentence,
an older inmate


1462
01:06:45.578 --> 01:06:49.014
whose nickname was The Devil,
wanted Reggie to take the blame


1463
01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:51.284
for a knife the guards had
found in the yard.


1464
01:06:51.317 --> 01:06:52.918
But Reggie refused.

1465
01:06:52.951 --> 01:06:54.620
The Devil attacked Reggie
with a knife,


1466
01:06:54.653 --> 01:06:56.355
slashing his neck.

1467
01:06:56.389 --> 01:06:57.956
Reggie later would say
he knew then


1468
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:59.692
either The Devil
was gonna kill him


1469
01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:01.627
or he had to kill The Devil.

1470
01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:04.497
About 15 minutes
after Reggie was attacked,


1471
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:06.632
he jumped over
a correctional officer


1472
01:07:06.665 --> 01:07:09.735
and stabbed The Devil
with a prison shank.


1473
01:07:09.768 --> 01:07:13.339
I sit back every day,
and I second-guess myself.


1474
01:07:13.372 --> 01:07:16.041
Could I have went about
the situation any other way?


1475
01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:18.511
And no matter how many times
I tell myself,


1476
01:07:18.544 --> 01:07:20.713
this was the only thing
that could have happened,


1477
01:07:20.746 --> 01:07:22.715
it don't sit right
with me in my cell


1478
01:07:22.748 --> 01:07:24.650
because I should have never
been there in the first place.


1479
01:07:24.683 --> 01:07:26.519
I'm innocent, man,
and you turned me


1480
01:07:26.552 --> 01:07:28.487
into what y'all say I was.

1481
01:07:28.521 --> 01:07:30.389
Y'all been lying on me
this whole time,


1482
01:07:30.423 --> 01:07:32.758
and you turned me into
a murderer because I had to.


1483
01:07:32.791 --> 01:07:35.328
[Susan] After that,
they put Reggie


1484
01:07:35.361 --> 01:07:36.895
in solitary confinement,

1485
01:07:36.929 --> 01:07:39.031
and he went from
a life sentence


1486
01:07:39.064 --> 01:07:43.369
without possibility of parole
to facing the death penalty.


1487
01:07:43.402 --> 01:07:47.573
So he gets put on trial
in the death penalty case,


1488
01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:50.709
and his lawyer starts looking
into his original case


1489
01:07:50.743 --> 01:07:52.545
and gives me a call and says,

1490
01:07:52.578 --> 01:07:54.513
"You know,
I think this guy's innocent


1491
01:07:54.547 --> 01:07:56.682
of what he went to prison
for in the first place."


1492
01:07:56.715 --> 01:07:59.385
And the second reason
Reggie got out


1493
01:07:59.418 --> 01:08:00.986
besides the prison stabbing

1494
01:08:01.019 --> 01:08:04.857
was this miracle
of there happened to be a book


1495
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:08.961
that had been put out
about the LA homicide division.


1496
01:08:08.994 --> 01:08:11.397
The author of the book
had documented a ride along


1497
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:13.799
with the LAPD detective.

1498
01:08:13.832 --> 01:08:15.768
This homicide investigator's
first night


1499
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:17.670
that she was on the job.

1500
01:08:17.703 --> 01:08:20.373
The very night
she investigated the murder,


1501
01:08:20.406 --> 01:08:22.107
she would ultimately arrest
Reggie for.


1502
01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:23.976
And we're flipping through
the book and reading it,


1503
01:08:24.009 --> 01:08:25.678
and there's
all this stuff in it


1504
01:08:25.711 --> 01:08:27.446
that was never disclosed
to the defense.


1505
01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.615
That's all documented
that all indicates


1506
01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:31.684
pretty clearly
that Reggie's innocent.


1507
01:08:31.717 --> 01:08:34.119
But it would still take
the Innocence Project 10 years


1508
01:08:34.152 --> 01:08:36.021
to get Reggie out of prison.

1509
01:08:36.054 --> 01:08:38.824
A grandmother doing life
for murder was released


1510
01:08:38.857 --> 01:08:41.427
from prison yesterday
after 17 years


1511
01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.896
when a judge said
she did not do it.


1512
01:08:43.929 --> 01:08:46.832
[Matthew] Susan Mellon recently
filed a lawsuit against


1513
01:08:46.865 --> 01:08:49.402
the detective who arrested her
for hiding evidence.


1514
01:08:49.435 --> 01:08:53.372
That detective is the same one
who arrested Reggie Cole.


1515
01:08:53.406 --> 01:08:56.041
[fire-engine siren wailing,
horn honking]


1516
01:09:02.515 --> 01:09:04.650
[sighs]

1517
01:09:11.657 --> 01:09:13.826
You know, we--
you know, as a society,


1518
01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:16.595
we see the bad guy
and the good guy.


1519
01:09:16.629 --> 01:09:18.631
Well, that's cops and robbers.

1520
01:09:18.664 --> 01:09:23.101
But when the cop becomes
the robber, the game is over.


1521
01:09:23.135 --> 01:09:26.104
The game is over.
That's corruption.


1522
01:09:26.138 --> 01:09:30.543
It was a horrific twist of fate
that led to Reggie's release.


1523
01:09:30.576 --> 01:09:32.978
Bruce was more fortunate.

1524
01:09:33.011 --> 01:09:35.581
His father's death
led to an unexpected turn.


1525
01:09:35.614 --> 01:09:38.884
Providence was his big thing,
and he had,


1526
01:09:38.917 --> 01:09:40.719
you know,
great life insurance.


1527
01:09:40.753 --> 01:09:43.489
It was 184,000 that my dad
left me,


1528
01:09:43.522 --> 01:09:46.525
and I was able to parlay
that up to about 236,


1529
01:09:46.559 --> 01:09:48.761
in the stock market,
and then it was just 100%


1530
01:09:48.794 --> 01:09:50.896
of my time dedicated to my case.

1531
01:09:50.929 --> 01:09:53.799
[Susan] And that enabled Bruce
to hire a private investigator.


1532
01:09:53.832 --> 01:09:57.936
We had, essentially,
a growing war chest of evidence


1533
01:09:57.970 --> 01:10:00.205
that I hadn't committed
the crime or at least


1534
01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:02.841
that all the evidence that was
presented was false evidence.


1535
01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:06.044
I had received
a complaint from Bruce Lisker.


1536
01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:10.048
I flew up to the state prison
where Bruce Lisker was.


1537
01:10:10.082 --> 01:10:11.717
I spoke to him.

1538
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.586
When somebody is accused
of murder


1539
01:10:13.619 --> 01:10:15.654
or you're arrested for murder,
it's tape-recorded.


1540
01:10:15.688 --> 01:10:18.624
Everything is tape-recorded.
I couldn't find his tape.


1541
01:10:18.657 --> 01:10:23.562
It had been taken out
of evidence by Detective Monsue,


1542
01:10:23.596 --> 01:10:26.632
and it was never
put back into evidence.


1543
01:10:26.665 --> 01:10:29.602
[Matthew] Detective Monsue
had said the footprints


1544
01:10:29.635 --> 01:10:32.938
outside the house matched
the footprints on the inside.


1545
01:10:32.971 --> 01:10:34.940
Lieutenant Gavin found
the footprints


1546
01:10:34.973 --> 01:10:37.075
weren't actually looked at
by a scientist


1547
01:10:37.109 --> 01:10:38.944
or any qualified expert.

1548
01:10:38.977 --> 01:10:40.679
So he took matters
into his own hands.


1549
01:10:40.713 --> 01:10:42.214
So I contacted our people,

1550
01:10:42.247 --> 01:10:44.483
scientific investigative
division.


1551
01:10:44.517 --> 01:10:47.219
So he takes out
this big magnifying glass,


1552
01:10:47.252 --> 01:10:49.054
looks at it,
looks at the other one,


1553
01:10:49.087 --> 01:10:50.756
and he goes,
"These two don't match."


1554
01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:52.691
See this is a great
embarrassment


1555
01:10:52.725 --> 01:10:54.960
for any large organization
that you've convicted


1556
01:10:54.993 --> 01:10:58.130
somebody for murder and then
five, 10, 20 years later,


1557
01:10:58.163 --> 01:11:01.634
it turns out that
the person's actually innocent.


1558
01:11:01.667 --> 01:11:03.836
And this is what
my lieutenant said--


1559
01:11:03.869 --> 01:11:05.971
"That motherfucker
is not getting out of prison.


1560
01:11:06.004 --> 01:11:07.873
Do you understand me,
Sergeant Gavin?"


1561
01:11:07.906 --> 01:11:11.143
They will do everything
they can to stop you,


1562
01:11:11.176 --> 01:11:13.712
prevent you from coming forward
with the information you have.


1563
01:11:13.746 --> 01:11:16.081
[Susan] Upon reviewing
the comprehensive work


1564
01:11:16.114 --> 01:11:17.950
of the private investigator,

1565
01:11:17.983 --> 01:11:20.018
the LAPD Internal
Affairs Department


1566
01:11:20.052 --> 01:11:22.120
claimed Bruce's complaints
were unfounded


1567
01:11:22.154 --> 01:11:24.289
and that no misconduct
had occurred.


1568
01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:26.224
You can't have
an internal investigation


1569
01:11:26.258 --> 01:11:28.994
where we all investigate
ourselves.


1570
01:11:29.027 --> 01:11:31.063
Tha-- that's like a joke.

1571
01:11:31.096 --> 01:11:33.231
I'm not against the authorities
or anything like that.


1572
01:11:33.265 --> 01:11:37.302
I'm just against the system
that has no checks and balances.


1573
01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:39.204
Who the fuck his checking y'all?

1574
01:11:39.237 --> 01:11:41.073
I believe that internal affairs

1575
01:11:41.106 --> 01:11:42.841
should be separate
from the police department.


1576
01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:44.710
There is no way that
a Police Department


1577
01:11:44.743 --> 01:11:46.612
can investigate themselves.

1578
01:11:46.645 --> 01:11:48.981
Currently, there are
no independent organizations


1579
01:11:49.014 --> 01:11:52.618
whose job it is to
investigate police misconduct.


1580
01:11:52.651 --> 01:11:56.121
And there's no oversight
of prosecutors, either.


1581
01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:00.659
Prosecutorial misconduct
is a major factor


1582
01:12:00.693 --> 01:12:02.194
of wrongful convictions.

1583
01:12:02.227 --> 01:12:04.096
It's a single thread
that runs through


1584
01:12:04.129 --> 01:12:07.099
almost all of
the wrongful-conviction cases.


1585
01:12:07.132 --> 01:12:10.168
[Matthew] Jeff Deskovic has
a Master's in criminal justice,


1586
01:12:10.202 --> 01:12:12.337
specializing
in wrongful convictions.


1587
01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:15.574
He's also a survivor
of prosecutorial misconduct.


1588
01:12:15.608 --> 01:12:17.275
I spent 16 years in prison.

1589
01:12:17.309 --> 01:12:20.646
I was wrongfully convicted
at 17.


1590
01:12:20.679 --> 01:12:23.081
I emerged at 32.

1591
01:12:23.115 --> 01:12:26.284
Jeff eventually won a lawsuit
against Putnam County,


1592
01:12:26.318 --> 01:12:28.286
New York,
for his conviction,


1593
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.088
which enabled him
to start his own foundation.


1594
01:12:30.122 --> 01:12:32.658
And I'm the founder
and executive director


1595
01:12:32.691 --> 01:12:34.760
of the Jeffrey Deskovic
Foundation for Justice.


1596
01:12:34.793 --> 01:12:36.695
There's no deterrence.
There's no oversight.


1597
01:12:36.729 --> 01:12:38.697
There's no punishment
for prosecutors.


1598
01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:40.298
So they can break the law.

1599
01:12:40.332 --> 01:12:42.635
They don't face
criminal penalties,


1600
01:12:42.668 --> 01:12:45.070
even when they engage
in withholding


1601
01:12:45.103 --> 01:12:47.272
evidence of innocence,
threatening witnesses,


1602
01:12:47.305 --> 01:12:49.041
coercing witnesses.

1603
01:12:49.074 --> 01:12:51.009
No matter how serious
the misconduct is,


1604
01:12:51.043 --> 01:12:54.913
if the prosecutor commits that
after an arrest has been made,


1605
01:12:54.947 --> 01:12:57.082
they have what's called
prosecutorial immunity.


1606
01:12:57.115 --> 01:12:58.851
They're above the law.

1607
01:12:58.884 --> 01:13:00.686
We need prosecutors

1608
01:13:00.719 --> 01:13:03.889
to really uphold
what's become just words,


1609
01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:06.158
which is, you know,
they're there to do justice.


1610
01:13:06.191 --> 01:13:08.293
They're there
to do the right thing.


1611
01:13:08.326 --> 01:13:10.996
It becomes more like
"we're there to win,"


1612
01:13:11.029 --> 01:13:12.831
especially when
prosecutor's offices


1613
01:13:12.865 --> 01:13:16.401
actually keep statistics
on conviction rates.


1614
01:13:16.434 --> 01:13:19.805
Well, you should be credited
that you looked at a case


1615
01:13:19.838 --> 01:13:23.141
where the police thought
they had a good case


1616
01:13:23.175 --> 01:13:24.910
but a good prosecutor
looked at it and said,


1617
01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:26.712
"You know what?
There's some mistakes made here.


1618
01:13:26.745 --> 01:13:28.814
We should drop the charges
in this case."


1619
01:13:28.847 --> 01:13:31.116
We should incentivize that.

1620
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:33.786
But instead, we actually
incentivize the opposite,


1621
01:13:33.819 --> 01:13:36.755
of getting convictions
and getting conviction rates.


1622
01:13:36.789 --> 01:13:39.357
All of a sudden, justice gets
lost in that process.


1623
01:13:39.391 --> 01:13:41.794
And whether this guy committed
the crime or not gets lost


1624
01:13:41.827 --> 01:13:44.396
in that process 'cause
it's all about winning my case.


1625
01:13:44.429 --> 01:13:46.398
Immunity, that's bullshit.

1626
01:13:46.431 --> 01:13:48.834
I mean, in the real world,
you know, you're supposed to be


1627
01:13:48.867 --> 01:13:51.036
held accountable
for your wrongdoings.


1628
01:13:51.069 --> 01:13:54.272
So, therefore, if you're
a person of authority--


1629
01:13:54.306 --> 01:13:56.809
of authority,
that you have to be held


1630
01:13:56.842 --> 01:13:58.711
at a higher standard
than just a layman.


1631
01:13:58.744 --> 01:14:00.746
I think we actually need
to step back


1632
01:14:00.779 --> 01:14:02.981
and kind of rethink
the whole system


1633
01:14:03.015 --> 01:14:04.817
in the way
we're approaching it


1634
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:07.119
because it's become this game,

1635
01:14:07.152 --> 01:14:09.955
and people's lives are lost
as a result of it.


1636
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.796
If you ever do find yourself
wrongfully convicted,


1637
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.932
odds are,
you're never getting out.


1638
01:14:19.965 --> 01:14:23.769
The first thing you need to do
is send preservation letters


1639
01:14:23.802 --> 01:14:27.005
to the Police Department labs
and the courts


1640
01:14:27.039 --> 01:14:30.108
requesting that you want
all your evidence saved.


1641
01:14:30.142 --> 01:14:33.779
Otherwise, they may destroy it
within 30 days.


1642
01:14:33.812 --> 01:14:37.349
Try to find an Innocence Project
that'll take your case.


1643
01:14:37.382 --> 01:14:40.485
Prepare for this process
to take years.


1644
01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:42.955
Then pray for a miracle.

1645
01:14:42.988 --> 01:14:46.825
The Innocence Project
estimates conservatively


1646
01:14:46.859 --> 01:14:51.263
there could easily be 40,000
to over 100,000 Americans


1647
01:14:51.296 --> 01:14:54.099
currently wrongfully convicted,

1648
01:14:54.132 --> 01:14:57.035
the majority of which
are people of color.


1649
01:14:59.337 --> 01:15:03.275
It's kind of hard for me
to relate to my family


1650
01:15:03.308 --> 01:15:05.243
because they don't see me
as the same.


1651
01:15:05.277 --> 01:15:07.913
It's like Adam and Eve
when he told them,


1652
01:15:07.946 --> 01:15:09.915
"Don't go
and don't eat this fruit,"


1653
01:15:09.948 --> 01:15:12.050
and they ate it,
and they were enlightened.


1654
01:15:12.084 --> 01:15:14.486
I'm enlightened.
I'm on the other side now.


1655
01:15:14.519 --> 01:15:16.922
I'm not the same
as y'all no more.


1656
01:15:16.955 --> 01:15:19.491
You know, I don't--
I can't speak


1657
01:15:19.524 --> 01:15:22.527
in a boisterous tone
because everyone gets scared.


1658
01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:25.130
But I'm not that dude.
I'm not him.


1659
01:15:35.173 --> 01:15:38.944
And I'm innocent, man.
I'm innocent.


1660
01:15:38.977 --> 01:15:40.846
You know,
I gotta fight my demons.


1661
01:15:40.879 --> 01:15:43.215
I gotta do what I gotta do
for me, you know?


1662
01:15:43.248 --> 01:15:45.183
I got a child, you know?

1663
01:15:45.217 --> 01:15:47.219
I'm trying
to get myself right so I can,


1664
01:15:47.252 --> 01:15:48.954
you know, teach her right.

1665
01:15:48.987 --> 01:15:50.789
But I mean,
there's no accountability.


1666
01:15:50.823 --> 01:15:52.557
These people
that did this to me,


1667
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:55.060
these people
that took everything, man,


1668
01:15:55.093 --> 01:15:56.795
they took everything.

1669
01:16:05.303 --> 01:16:07.139
[Susan] Bruce's
private investigator


1670
01:16:07.172 --> 01:16:08.874
never gave up on his case.

1671
01:16:08.907 --> 01:16:12.010
He had a very vigorous
private investigator


1672
01:16:12.044 --> 01:16:14.079
who made a complaint
to the LAPD,


1673
01:16:14.112 --> 01:16:17.349
and it landed on the desk of
an Internal Affairs investigator


1674
01:16:17.382 --> 01:16:23.121
who looked at Bruce's claims in
a very serious-minded fashion.


1675
01:16:29.161 --> 01:16:31.897
It's the people
like Detective Monsue


1676
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:34.399
and the others out there
that have made our job


1677
01:16:34.432 --> 01:16:36.468
very difficult to do
day after day


1678
01:16:36.501 --> 01:16:39.404
because we lose
the confidence of the public,


1679
01:16:39.437 --> 01:16:41.439
and we lose the confidence
of the courts.


1680
01:16:41.473 --> 01:16:44.309
We have to have police chiefs,
directors of public service


1681
01:16:44.342 --> 01:16:46.411
that are willing to do
the right thing


1682
01:16:46.444 --> 01:16:49.982
and terminate employees
who are doing the wrong thing.


1683
01:16:50.015 --> 01:16:51.950
If you want to say
you're the good guy


1684
01:16:51.984 --> 01:16:54.419
but you're ostracized by
everybody that you believed in,


1685
01:16:54.452 --> 01:16:58.090
it's a very difficult situation
because I have to continue


1686
01:16:58.123 --> 01:17:00.959
to work for the same department
that did this to Bruce Lisker.


1687
01:17:00.993 --> 01:17:02.961
I don't look at myself
as a hero.


1688
01:17:02.995 --> 01:17:08.033
I look at myself as a survivor
because the system attacked me.


1689
01:17:08.066 --> 01:17:10.535
The system went after me,
and the system did


1690
01:17:10.568 --> 01:17:13.571
everything they could
to keep Bruce Lisker in jail


1691
01:17:13.605 --> 01:17:16.008
and everything to keep me quiet.

1692
01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:18.176
It's been a lot of therapy.

1693
01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:22.014
My wife and I met
in third grade.


1694
01:17:22.047 --> 01:17:24.382
We were elementary, junior-high,
high-school sweethearts.


1695
01:17:24.416 --> 01:17:26.284
We lived on the same street,

1696
01:17:26.318 --> 01:17:29.955
and it's been a very difficult,
difficult road.


1697
01:17:29.988 --> 01:17:32.124
She is third-generation LAPD.

1698
01:17:32.157 --> 01:17:36.094
And the survival is day by day

1699
01:17:36.128 --> 01:17:38.096
and always looking
over your shoulder


1700
01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:40.032
whether you're doing
the right thing or not.


1701
01:17:40.065 --> 01:17:42.034
You're constantly
looking over your shoulder.


1702
01:17:42.067 --> 01:17:45.037
And every time I get called
into the captain's office,


1703
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:47.639
I wonder, "What did I do now?"

1704
01:17:47.672 --> 01:17:49.908
And I've never had
that feeling before.


1705
01:17:49.942 --> 01:17:52.677
I just kept on telling myself,
they are not going to defeat me.


1706
01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.546
They're not going to defeat me.

1707
01:17:54.579 --> 01:17:58.050
It's just when you
come across something like this,


1708
01:17:58.083 --> 01:17:59.517
what are you gonna do?

1709
01:17:59.551 --> 01:18:01.453
And that's the difficult thing.

1710
01:18:01.486 --> 01:18:04.556
If I had not given up
the information that I did


1711
01:18:04.589 --> 01:18:08.560
to the LA Times, Bruce Lisker
would still be in prison.


1712
01:18:08.593 --> 01:18:12.630
[Matt] A bloody footprint
that was attributed to Bruce


1713
01:18:12.664 --> 01:18:16.168
at his trial had recently
been reanalyzed


1714
01:18:16.201 --> 01:18:19.171
and shown to have not been
made from Bruce's shoe.


1715
01:18:19.204 --> 01:18:20.973
So that got us interested
in the case,


1716
01:18:21.006 --> 01:18:23.375
and we started talking
to his private investigator


1717
01:18:23.408 --> 01:18:26.111
and began
the seven-month investigation.


1718
01:18:26.144 --> 01:18:29.047
And at the conclusion of that,
they filed an article


1719
01:18:29.081 --> 01:18:31.483
called A Case of Doubt
that eventually


1720
01:18:31.516 --> 01:18:34.019
won them an award,
won The Times an award.


1721
01:18:34.052 --> 01:18:36.354
I wound up sitting
between 2005,


1722
01:18:36.388 --> 01:18:39.324
when the first article came out,
and 2009 in prison,


1723
01:18:39.357 --> 01:18:42.260
four solid years...

1724
01:18:42.294 --> 01:18:45.097
a widely recognized
innocent man.


1725
01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:50.035
We knew back in 2003, 2004,
that we had probably a person


1726
01:18:50.068 --> 01:18:52.270
that was in prison
for a crime he did not commit.


1727
01:18:52.304 --> 01:18:54.072
And it took five years
for the courts


1728
01:18:54.106 --> 01:18:56.408
to work through the--
the entire system.


1729
01:18:56.441 --> 01:18:59.277
There were a lot of delays
because of the conduct


1730
01:18:59.311 --> 01:19:01.546
of my own police department
and the conduct


1731
01:19:01.579 --> 01:19:05.383
of the California
Attorney General.


1732
01:19:05.417 --> 01:19:08.153
[Matthew] Reggie Cole
spent 16 years in prison


1733
01:19:08.186 --> 01:19:10.255
for a crime he didn't commit.

1734
01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:13.291
10 of those years were spent
in solitary confinement,


1735
01:19:13.325 --> 01:19:16.394
and he had to kill another man
to get a trial.


1736
01:19:16.428 --> 01:19:18.763
The whole way I've been
telling them, I'm innocent.


1737
01:19:18.796 --> 01:19:20.598
Every article I'm in,
everything--


1738
01:19:20.632 --> 01:19:22.500
everybody I'm talking to,
I'm telling them,


1739
01:19:22.534 --> 01:19:25.537
"I'm innocent, man,
I didn't do anything to anyone."


1740
01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:28.073
They don't care.
They don't care.


1741
01:19:28.106 --> 01:19:31.043
It's not that they didn't know.
They didn't care.


1742
01:19:31.076 --> 01:19:33.445
It's a miracle Reggie
got out at all.


1743
01:19:39.217 --> 01:19:42.020
Tim's is a miracle story
as well.


1744
01:19:42.054 --> 01:19:46.591
In late 2012, after 26 years,
he made parole.


1745
01:19:46.624 --> 01:19:49.094
I signed some papers
for the parole officer,


1746
01:19:49.127 --> 01:19:51.329
he said,
"Okay, see you later.


1747
01:19:54.566 --> 01:19:56.534
Didn't ask me
how I was getting home,


1748
01:19:56.568 --> 01:19:59.037
didn't ask me if I had a home.

1749
01:19:59.071 --> 01:20:03.741
When I realized these people
honestly don't give a fuck.


1750
01:20:09.614 --> 01:20:11.183
To survive getting out,

1751
01:20:11.216 --> 01:20:13.351
it's a lot harder
than it sounds.


1752
01:20:13.385 --> 01:20:15.787
You may have developed
post-traumatic stress disorder,


1753
01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:20.425
agoraphobia, paranoia
and require immediate treatment.


1754
01:20:20.458 --> 01:20:23.528
You're gonna need food,
new clothes.


1755
01:20:23.561 --> 01:20:26.231
You're going to need money
for transportation


1756
01:20:26.264 --> 01:20:29.134
to and from
your parole-officer meeting.


1757
01:20:29.167 --> 01:20:31.069
If you miss a meeting,

1758
01:20:31.103 --> 01:20:33.805
you could find yourself
back in jail.


1759
01:20:33.838 --> 01:20:35.673
You're going to need a job,

1760
01:20:35.707 --> 01:20:37.575
but there's a lot
of discrimination out there


1761
01:20:37.609 --> 01:20:39.411
for employment and housing.

1762
01:20:39.444 --> 01:20:43.348
Speaking of which,
you're gonna need a home.


1763
01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:45.217
I wouldn't have a home

1764
01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:48.120
if it wasn't for
the Rescue a Life Foundation.


1765
01:20:48.153 --> 01:20:51.089
They set up a house,
a transitional housing.


1766
01:20:51.123 --> 01:20:56.328
God and that foundation
is what's got me by.


1767
01:20:56.361 --> 01:20:59.431
It's the reason I'm sitting here
and not back inside.


1768
01:20:59.464 --> 01:21:02.434
[Susan] The Rescue
a Life Foundation was founded


1769
01:21:02.467 --> 01:21:05.370
by Dwayne McElwee who knows
how challenging it can be


1770
01:21:05.403 --> 01:21:07.372
to re-enter society.

1771
01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:10.475
Dwayne did 25 years himself
for murder.


1772
01:21:10.508 --> 01:21:12.677
After school,
we would have to go down


1773
01:21:12.710 --> 01:21:15.413
to my mother's dress shop
and hang out all day


1774
01:21:15.447 --> 01:21:17.249
and work around the business.

1775
01:21:17.282 --> 01:21:19.651
At that time,
we had several organizations


1776
01:21:19.684 --> 01:21:21.553
that would just patrol
that area.


1777
01:21:21.586 --> 01:21:24.122
So it was pretty safe.
We had the Black Panthers,


1778
01:21:24.156 --> 01:21:26.591
Ron Karenga's
whole organization,


1779
01:21:26.624 --> 01:21:27.825
United Slaves.

1780
01:21:27.859 --> 01:21:30.328
We had the Nation of Islam.

1781
01:21:30.362 --> 01:21:32.530
It was pretty cool,
you didn't have to worry


1782
01:21:32.564 --> 01:21:35.133
about people coming in,
holding you up and everything.


1783
01:21:35.167 --> 01:21:37.169
Didn't have to worry
about that type of stuff.


1784
01:21:37.202 --> 01:21:42.140
But it was after the COINTELPRO
when they got pushed underground


1785
01:21:42.174 --> 01:21:44.776
that everything just seemed
like, you know, went crazy.


1786
01:21:44.809 --> 01:21:46.611
All the thugs came out,
and then, you know,


1787
01:21:46.644 --> 01:21:49.414
you were fair game then,
the store operators.


1788
01:21:49.447 --> 01:21:51.416
That's when we started having
a lot of robberies,


1789
01:21:51.449 --> 01:21:53.385
a lot of burglaries.

1790
01:21:53.418 --> 01:21:56.788
My mother, she's just
a little, bitty 5-foot-4 lady.


1791
01:21:56.821 --> 01:21:59.891
She was beat up and robbed
one day while I was there.


1792
01:21:59.924 --> 01:22:02.460
And he grabbed her,
threw her to the ground


1793
01:22:02.494 --> 01:22:04.496
and kicked her and beat her
after he got the money.


1794
01:22:04.529 --> 01:22:06.598
Then he figured it wasn't
enough money, you know?


1795
01:22:06.631 --> 01:22:08.633
And I was a little kid.

1796
01:22:08.666 --> 01:22:11.836
I was probably about 11 years
old at the time, you know?


1797
01:22:11.869 --> 01:22:14.239
And he had this gun on him,
and she was hollering at me


1798
01:22:14.272 --> 01:22:16.241
not to move and just--
you know,


1799
01:22:16.274 --> 01:22:19.444
and this dude is kicking her
and demanding more money.


1800
01:22:19.477 --> 01:22:21.679
He got all the money we had,
you know?


1801
01:22:21.713 --> 01:22:24.649
[Matthew] Dwayne's mother
wasn't robbed once.


1802
01:22:24.682 --> 01:22:26.684
She was robbed over
and over again.


1803
01:22:26.718 --> 01:22:28.720
I had a good friend.

1804
01:22:28.753 --> 01:22:31.656
He would always be commenting
about me being so uptight.


1805
01:22:31.689 --> 01:22:34.892
And he smoked weed.
He said, "Man, just take this.


1806
01:22:34.926 --> 01:22:36.594
You need,
this, like, medication."


1807
01:22:36.628 --> 01:22:38.263
That led to other things.
you know.


1808
01:22:38.296 --> 01:22:42.500
That led to cocaine,
it led to PCP,


1809
01:22:42.534 --> 01:22:45.870
Which ended up leading
to my crime


1810
01:22:45.903 --> 01:22:48.273
that happened that sent me
to prison, you know.


1811
01:22:48.306 --> 01:22:50.508
I went to prison
for a second-degree murder.


1812
01:22:50.542 --> 01:22:52.310
Some dudes robbed me.

1813
01:22:52.344 --> 01:22:54.212
They were supposed to have been
the middleman


1814
01:22:54.246 --> 01:22:56.848
going to get the drugs,
and they end up robbing me.


1815
01:22:56.881 --> 01:22:59.484
Because it had happened to us
in our business,


1816
01:22:59.517 --> 01:23:02.420
the family business so much,
this guy,


1817
01:23:02.454 --> 01:23:05.223
he wasn't just someone that
was robbing me all the time.


1818
01:23:05.257 --> 01:23:06.858
He was the image of somebody

1819
01:23:06.891 --> 01:23:09.627
that had been victimizing
my family.


1820
01:23:09.661 --> 01:23:11.996
And all these other times,
you had got away,


1821
01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:14.266
but this time,
you weren't going to get away.


1822
01:23:14.299 --> 01:23:17.302
So it was kind of like
a revenge thing,


1823
01:23:17.335 --> 01:23:19.637
a retaliation thing
for you and your kind.


1824
01:23:19.671 --> 01:23:22.307
You're going to pay for that,
and so what I found


1825
01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:26.678
is that what you can't forgive,
you end up becoming.


1826
01:23:26.711 --> 01:23:30.682
What you can't forgive,
you end up becoming.


1827
01:23:34.319 --> 01:23:36.954
So I had to learn how to forgive
and let that go,


1828
01:23:36.988 --> 01:23:39.257
and I had to learn
how to forgive him


1829
01:23:39.291 --> 01:23:42.327
and let that go
because he was also after--


1830
01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:46.931
I got to see his record,
and this guy had a rap sheet,


1831
01:23:46.964 --> 01:23:48.866
you know, from here--
from one side of the room


1832
01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:52.570
to the other, you know,
and I could see that, you know,


1833
01:23:52.604 --> 01:23:54.506
he needed the same help
that I needed.


1834
01:23:54.539 --> 01:23:56.508
We are generally taught
to imagine


1835
01:23:56.541 --> 01:23:59.544
that there is such a thing as,
for example, a murderer, right?


1836
01:23:59.577 --> 01:24:01.879
So in other words, a murderer
in the public imagination


1837
01:24:01.913 --> 01:24:04.549
and in most of our minds,
whether we've thought about it


1838
01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:08.286
or not, initially,
is someone who likes to murder


1839
01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.388
and who would murder
given the opportunity, right?


1840
01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:12.324
It's like a vocation, right?
That's what murderers do.


1841
01:24:12.357 --> 01:24:14.058
They go around murdering,
right?


1842
01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:16.060
And that's why you don't let
them out of prison


1843
01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:18.463
You let them out of prison,
they're going to murder again.


1844
01:24:18.496 --> 01:24:21.966
The reality is that murder
is almost always a context.


1845
01:24:21.999 --> 01:24:23.535
It's a situation.

1846
01:24:23.568 --> 01:24:25.403
It is,
statistically speaking,


1847
01:24:25.437 --> 01:24:28.373
very rarely driven
by a compulsion


1848
01:24:28.406 --> 01:24:30.808
or a desire to do harm, right?

1849
01:24:30.842 --> 01:24:33.411
It's a reaction to some set
of circumstances,


1850
01:24:33.445 --> 01:24:38.416
to a real or perceived threat,
to some extreme emotional state.


1851
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:40.418
It's not a propensity.

1852
01:24:40.452 --> 01:24:43.721
Basically, we're confusing
the profile of a psychopath,


1853
01:24:43.755 --> 01:24:46.491
the psychopath we've read about,
you know, the serial killer,


1854
01:24:46.524 --> 01:24:48.092
with prisoners in general,
right?


1855
01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:51.863
If we as a society
stop and imagine


1856
01:24:51.896 --> 01:24:55.400
that the people in prison
are fully human,


1857
01:24:55.433 --> 01:24:58.336
incredibly diverse,
have often been through


1858
01:24:58.370 --> 01:25:02.674
some of the most extreme
and difficult situations


1859
01:25:02.707 --> 01:25:04.776
and conditions,
some of which many of us


1860
01:25:04.809 --> 01:25:08.546
couldn't even really
begin to imagine, then suddenly,


1861
01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:11.783
all of that judgment
and all that hostility


1862
01:25:11.816 --> 01:25:14.519
and all that vindictiveness

1863
01:25:14.552 --> 01:25:16.954
doesn't have such
a natural place anymore.


1864
01:25:16.988 --> 01:25:19.457
Many of our students
have committed murder


1865
01:25:19.491 --> 01:25:21.993
and felt horrible
about their crime


1866
01:25:22.026 --> 01:25:23.861
as soon as it happened.

1867
01:25:23.895 --> 01:25:25.730
It's not like they needed
to sit in prison for 15


1868
01:25:25.763 --> 01:25:27.665
or 20 years to realize
they'd done a bad thing


1869
01:25:27.699 --> 01:25:29.467
or to never want to do it again.

1870
01:25:29.501 --> 01:25:33.838
There's no human element...

1871
01:25:33.871 --> 01:25:37.675
to the criminal justice
system.


1872
01:25:37.709 --> 01:25:40.712
There's no human element.
They're not there to help you.


1873
01:25:40.745 --> 01:25:42.814
They're not there
to help society.


1874
01:25:42.847 --> 01:25:46.117
They can say that that's what
it's set up for all they want.


1875
01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:48.853
That's not what it's there for,

1876
01:25:48.886 --> 01:25:52.023
not in California
and not in a lot of places.


1877
01:25:52.056 --> 01:25:55.159
It's a system set up
to punish people,


1878
01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:56.928
and they take a bad situation,

1879
01:25:56.961 --> 01:25:59.464
and they usually
make it much worse.


1880
01:26:02.834 --> 01:26:05.970
You know what the official
success rate of state prison is?


1881
01:26:06.003 --> 01:26:11.509
Nearly 80% of all inmates
go back within five years.


1882
01:26:11.543 --> 01:26:14.078
[man]
That's a success rate of 20%.


1883
01:26:14.111 --> 01:26:16.681
Imagine if we had those
requirements of airplanes.


1884
01:26:16.714 --> 01:26:19.617
Wow, eight out of 10 airplanes
falling out of the sky.


1885
01:26:19.651 --> 01:26:21.185
It's a little bit crazy-making.

1886
01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:22.987
And that is
Department of Justice data.


1887
01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:24.989
That's federal government
research.


1888
01:26:25.022 --> 01:26:27.859
Dr. Michael Coyle
attended Harvard University,


1889
01:26:27.892 --> 01:26:30.462
has a PhD in justice studies

1890
01:26:30.495 --> 01:26:32.063
and is a professor
of criminal justice


1891
01:26:32.096 --> 01:26:33.731
at California State
University.


1892
01:26:33.765 --> 01:26:35.567
Dr. Coyle says that prison

1893
01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.569
not only increases
criminal behavior


1894
01:26:37.602 --> 01:26:40.104
but has a deleterious effect
on society as a whole.


1895
01:26:40.137 --> 01:26:43.107
What happens to a family
when the wage earner is removed


1896
01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:46.578
from society and thrown
into prison for 10 years?


1897
01:26:46.611 --> 01:26:49.046
What happens to those children?
How are they impacted?


1898
01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.015
What are their chances
of success in life?


1899
01:26:51.048 --> 01:26:52.617
They start to go down.

1900
01:26:52.650 --> 01:26:54.986
How does that impact
the community?


1901
01:26:55.019 --> 01:26:56.854
Loss of resources
in that community,


1902
01:26:56.888 --> 01:26:58.656
more demands
on the community now to help--


1903
01:26:58.690 --> 01:27:00.224
to help this family,

1904
01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:02.594
maybe the other parent,
maybe the children.


1905
01:27:02.627 --> 01:27:06.063
It's just so clearly
a failure


1906
01:27:06.097 --> 01:27:08.766
by every measure
that you look at it


1907
01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.903
that I think we just need
to rethink the whole thing


1908
01:27:11.936 --> 01:27:16.007
and not just keep trying
to put lipstick on this pig,


1909
01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.809
'cause that's what we're doing.

1910
01:27:17.842 --> 01:27:19.744
I think it is difficult
for people to imagine


1911
01:27:19.777 --> 01:27:21.178
a world without prisons now.

1912
01:27:21.212 --> 01:27:24.482
We've become so accustomed

1913
01:27:24.516 --> 01:27:27.118
to the idea of prisons that
it's hard for people to imagine.


1914
01:27:27.151 --> 01:27:30.121
Well, what do you do with people
if you don't put them in prison


1915
01:27:30.154 --> 01:27:31.923
when they've done wrong?

1916
01:27:31.956 --> 01:27:33.691
There are other alternatives.

1917
01:27:33.725 --> 01:27:36.227
Dostoevsky said the degree
of civilization


1918
01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:39.163
in a society could be judged
by entering its prisons.


1919
01:27:39.196 --> 01:27:41.966
Hebrews, 13:3,

1920
01:27:41.999 --> 01:27:44.636
remember those who are in chains

1921
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:47.905
as if you
were in chains with them.


1922
01:27:47.939 --> 01:27:50.742
If we don't,
we put everybody at risk.


1923
01:27:52.777 --> 01:27:55.947
My husband, Dan,
was a police officer,


1924
01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.616
and he was killed
in the line of duty.


1925
01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:02.554
My goal at the trial
was to get the man


1926
01:28:02.587 --> 01:28:06.157
who killed my husband
convicted of first-degree murder


1927
01:28:06.190 --> 01:28:09.727
and be given the death penalty,
and that's what I got.


1928
01:28:09.761 --> 01:28:12.597
That's what happened.
I thought okay, here it is.


1929
01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:16.701
I got justice.
I'm gonna be free from this.


1930
01:28:16.734 --> 01:28:20.037
And it didn't happen.
It was-- it was just a lie.


1931
01:28:20.071 --> 01:28:22.306
It didn't change anything.

1932
01:28:22.339 --> 01:28:24.308
[Susan]
Aqeela Sherrills is famous


1933
01:28:24.341 --> 01:28:26.644
for brokering the truce
between the Crips


1934
01:28:26.678 --> 01:28:28.846
and the Bloods in 1992.

1935
01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.585
Then in 2004, he experienced
an unimaginable tragedy.


1936
01:28:33.618 --> 01:28:38.255
My oldest son was murdered,
home from winter break, college.


1937
01:28:38.289 --> 01:28:41.893
And, yeah,
was shot to death at a party.


1938
01:28:41.926 --> 01:28:43.695
You know, so my daughter
called me and was like,


1939
01:28:43.728 --> 01:28:45.597
"Hey, you know, dad,
they getting together


1940
01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:47.699
over on Sesame Street
in the projects and stuff,


1941
01:28:47.732 --> 01:28:49.867
and they talking about going
on a mission for Tyrell."


1942
01:28:49.901 --> 01:28:51.836
So I jumped in my car,
and I drove over there


1943
01:28:51.869 --> 01:28:54.171
to the projects,
and I jumped out the car,


1944
01:28:54.205 --> 01:28:56.674
and I said, "Hey," I said,

1945
01:28:56.708 --> 01:28:58.576
"Man, we've played
this eye-for-an-eye,


1946
01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:00.277
tooth-for-a tooth game
long enough."


1947
01:29:00.311 --> 01:29:03.080
I'm like, "You know,
it's left us all blind


1948
01:29:03.114 --> 01:29:04.782
and toothless, you know?"

1949
01:29:04.816 --> 01:29:06.651
And I'm like,
"Without anybody here


1950
01:29:06.684 --> 01:29:08.085
to provide direction
and guidance for the kids


1951
01:29:08.119 --> 01:29:09.954
and the young folks
and the parents


1952
01:29:09.987 --> 01:29:12.056
and the loved ones
that are left behind like"--


1953
01:29:12.089 --> 01:29:14.992
I'm like,
"Let's do something different."


1954
01:29:15.026 --> 01:29:17.829
I've met people who've had

1955
01:29:17.862 --> 01:29:20.331
absolutely devastating things
happen to them,


1956
01:29:20.364 --> 01:29:22.900
and they're just angry
and bitter.


1957
01:29:22.934 --> 01:29:27.204
And I didn't want that to be me.
I'd done that long enough.


1958
01:29:27.238 --> 01:29:29.273
And it wasn't working.

1959
01:29:29.306 --> 01:29:31.776
And I needed
something different.


1960
01:29:31.809 --> 01:29:35.012
Dionne and Aqeela
did something incredible.


1961
01:29:35.046 --> 01:29:38.750
They rose to a consciousness
most of us cannot imagine.


1962
01:29:38.783 --> 01:29:40.652
They didn't condone
what happened,


1963
01:29:40.685 --> 01:29:42.353
but they forgave it.

1964
01:29:42.386 --> 01:29:44.856
I believe in the "F" word,
you know, forgiveness.


1965
01:29:44.889 --> 01:29:48.092
Because of forgiveness is not,
you know,


1966
01:29:48.125 --> 01:29:50.762
something that you do
for the perpetrator.


1967
01:29:50.795 --> 01:29:52.363
It's something
that you do for yourself.


1968
01:29:52.396 --> 01:29:56.801
There is no cure
to violence in violence.


1969
01:29:56.834 --> 01:29:59.403
Violence can never
be a cure for violence.


1970
01:29:59.436 --> 01:30:01.238
It's been said
for thousands of years.


1971
01:30:01.272 --> 01:30:04.842
You can't fight darkness
with darkness.


1972
01:30:04.876 --> 01:30:06.778
You can only bring in the light.

1973
01:30:06.811 --> 01:30:10.214
If we're really trying
to deliver public safety,


1974
01:30:10.247 --> 01:30:13.284
then we need to start
asking questions.


1975
01:30:13.317 --> 01:30:15.019
We need to say why.

1976
01:30:15.052 --> 01:30:17.054
What happened
in the personal life


1977
01:30:17.088 --> 01:30:19.256
of this young man to cause him
to have this callous heart,


1978
01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:21.826
this fear that he would take
another human being's life?


1979
01:30:21.859 --> 01:30:25.096
Why is this person

1980
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:28.265
cycling in and out
of jail or prison?


1981
01:30:28.299 --> 01:30:30.735
For Dionne, she decided
she wanted the death


1982
01:30:30.768 --> 01:30:34.171
of her husband Dan to lead
to something transformative,


1983
01:30:34.205 --> 01:30:39.677
something good and the same
for Aqeela and his son, Tyrell.


1984
01:30:39.711 --> 01:30:41.746
We're going to harness
the essence of Tyrell,


1985
01:30:41.779 --> 01:30:43.815
and we're going to do something
much more profound with this.


1986
01:30:43.848 --> 01:30:45.983
The point is to understand
what's happened.


1987
01:30:46.017 --> 01:30:48.720
How can we repair the harm
that's been done?


1988
01:30:48.753 --> 01:30:51.022
How can we make sure
that it doesn't happen again?


1989
01:30:51.055 --> 01:30:52.890
And how can we, you know--
with that individual,


1990
01:30:52.924 --> 01:30:54.926
but also with other individuals
coming after them.


1991
01:30:54.959 --> 01:30:57.094
When we get the answer
to that question,


1992
01:30:57.128 --> 01:30:59.230
we need to actually
do something about it.


1993
01:30:59.263 --> 01:31:01.699
Real investment in institutions

1994
01:31:01.733 --> 01:31:04.035
that help people
to heal from trauma.


1995
01:31:04.068 --> 01:31:07.204
There was an interesting
article


1996
01:31:07.238 --> 01:31:09.040
in The New York Times
a few years ago.


1997
01:31:09.073 --> 01:31:11.943
It was called
Million Dollar Blocks,


1998
01:31:11.976 --> 01:31:15.780
where if you calculated
how many of the residents


1999
01:31:15.813 --> 01:31:18.816
of that particular block
were actually incarcerated


2000
01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:21.786
and you added up
how much it cost the state


2001
01:31:21.819 --> 01:31:23.821
to keep those people
incarcerated,


2002
01:31:23.855 --> 01:31:27.258
you would actually come up with
more than $1 million per block.


2003
01:31:27.291 --> 01:31:30.394
What I would say is
take those million dollars


2004
01:31:30.427 --> 01:31:33.264
that you're spending to put
all those people in prison


2005
01:31:33.297 --> 01:31:36.133
and invest them
in the kinds of things


2006
01:31:36.167 --> 01:31:38.736
that we know very well

2007
01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:40.772
will actually transform
those communities.


2008
01:31:40.805 --> 01:31:44.108
My passion is Shakespeare
because it's about words.


2009
01:31:44.141 --> 01:31:47.311
And the only way that
you can heal trauma


2010
01:31:47.344 --> 01:31:48.946
is to find language for it.

2011
01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:51.215
I met my father
when I was like 15.


2012
01:31:51.248 --> 01:31:53.284
[Curt] Never met him before?
Never saw him?


2013
01:31:53.317 --> 01:31:55.820
There's something strange here.
It's something--


2014
01:31:55.853 --> 01:31:58.022
someone with my kind of
background here a little bit.


2015
01:31:58.055 --> 01:32:00.391
What they're trying to do
is simply inhabit


2016
01:32:00.424 --> 01:32:03.127
that character
as truthfully as they can.


2017
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.162
And in analyzing
and digging down deep


2018
01:32:05.196 --> 01:32:07.164
into the truth
of that character,


2019
01:32:07.198 --> 01:32:09.533
what happens is they begin
to dig into their own lives.


2020
01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:12.837
[man] When I was a young man
and I came to prison,


2021
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:16.340
the older convicts taught me how
to hustle at every opportunity


2022
01:32:16.373 --> 01:32:18.810
to make money,
how to get over on the police.


2023
01:32:18.843 --> 01:32:23.014
And I looked up to them.
They were my mentors.


2024
01:32:23.047 --> 01:32:24.782
Through Shakespeare Behind Bars,

2025
01:32:24.816 --> 01:32:29.086
I have learned that mentoring--
mentoring is--


2026
01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:32.056
it's very important,
but it's also important


2027
01:32:32.089 --> 01:32:33.925
to mentor them
in the right direction.


2028
01:32:33.958 --> 01:32:36.828
So, our recidivism rate
in Kentucky


2029
01:32:36.861 --> 01:32:40.164
for this program,

2030
01:32:40.197 --> 01:32:42.934
Guys that are out on the street.
"Why didn't they go back?"


2031
01:32:42.967 --> 01:32:45.837
People ask all the time.
I say, "Don't ask me, ask them."


2032
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:47.839
What'll they tell you?
Here's what I hear them say.


2033
01:32:47.872 --> 01:32:51.208
"I take responsibility for
the crime that brought me here.


2034
01:32:51.242 --> 01:32:53.577
I now understand where
that behavior came from


2035
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:55.880
because I've gone back
in my life,


2036
01:32:55.913 --> 01:32:57.414
and I've looked at all of that.

2037
01:32:57.448 --> 01:33:00.952
But I am not
that human being anymore.


2038
01:33:00.985 --> 01:33:05.022
That's what arts programming
many times gives prisoners hope,


2039
01:33:05.056 --> 01:33:08.392
because arts deal with
the internal essence


2040
01:33:08.425 --> 01:33:10.227
of what it means
to be a human being.


2041
01:33:10.261 --> 01:33:12.997
[man vocalizing]

2042
01:33:16.934 --> 01:33:21.906
Vipassana is an intense program,
a meditative technique.


2043
01:33:21.939 --> 01:33:26.177
The inmate has to go through it

2044
01:33:26.210 --> 01:33:29.580
- for a 10-day period of time.
- I spent eight and a half years


2045
01:33:29.613 --> 01:33:31.348
on death row,
and this was harder.


2046
01:33:31.382 --> 01:33:34.051
All the stuff
that's buried down deep,


2047
01:33:34.085 --> 01:33:35.586
they come up gradually.

2048
01:33:35.619 --> 01:33:37.889
They want you there long enough

2049
01:33:37.922 --> 01:33:40.224
that you actually deal
with your stuff.


2050
01:33:40.257 --> 01:33:41.926
[woman] She says...

2051
01:33:46.497 --> 01:33:49.366
[Matthew] This is a restorative
justice workshop.


2052
01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.936
They're very rare,
and they are much harder


2053
01:33:51.969 --> 01:33:55.106
on perpetrators of crimes
than sitting in a prison cell.


2054
01:33:55.139 --> 01:33:57.308
It puts these guys face to face

2055
01:33:57.341 --> 01:33:59.510
with the human consequences
of their actions.


2056
01:33:59.543 --> 01:34:01.478
This is Rosa.

2057
01:34:01.512 --> 01:34:03.647
Her son was killed
in a drive-by shooting.


2058
01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.884
And now, she devotes her life
to telling inmates


2059
01:34:06.918 --> 01:34:10.154
serving time for murder what
the effect was of their crime


2060
01:34:10.187 --> 01:34:12.957
not just for the deceased
but on everyone.


2061
01:34:32.276 --> 01:34:34.378
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.


2062
01:34:34.411 --> 01:34:36.213
[applause]

2063
01:34:53.530 --> 01:34:55.332
[Rosa] You know what?

2064
01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.242
Restorative justice programs

2065
01:35:05.276 --> 01:35:08.012
and victim/offender
reconciliations can take years.


2066
01:35:08.045 --> 01:35:10.247
They require a staff
and resources


2067
01:35:10.281 --> 01:35:12.049
and they're incredibly
successful.


2068
01:35:12.083 --> 01:35:13.650
Those who go through
these programs


2069
01:35:13.684 --> 01:35:16.220
have as low as 10% rates
of reoffending


2070
01:35:16.253 --> 01:35:20.491
as opposed to the 80% failure
rates prisons shamefully have.


2071
01:35:20.524 --> 01:35:22.593
We sit there perplexed like,
wow, what are we gonna do


2072
01:35:22.626 --> 01:35:24.395
about this criminal
justice system?


2073
01:35:24.428 --> 01:35:27.598
It's such a mess.
[laughs]


2074
01:35:27.631 --> 01:35:31.735
Maybe if we just stopped doing
these things that we're doing


2075
01:35:31.768 --> 01:35:35.706
and we try on a whole new set
of other things,


2076
01:35:35.739 --> 01:35:39.210
it might turn out to be a little
bit simpler than we thought.


2077
01:35:39.243 --> 01:35:44.248
The biggest prison we have
is an invisible prison.


2078
01:35:44.281 --> 01:35:47.318
It's the conditioned mind,
and you don't know


2079
01:35:47.351 --> 01:35:49.653
you're in the prison because
you can't see bars.


2080
01:35:49.686 --> 01:35:51.522
You can't see walls.

2081
01:35:51.555 --> 01:35:54.491
And the conditioned mind
is the separate mind.


2082
01:35:54.525 --> 01:35:56.127
It doesn't exist.

2083
01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.129
We are part of
a collective mind,


2084
01:35:58.162 --> 01:36:01.132
and if the collective mind
is violent, then we are violent.


2085
01:36:01.165 --> 01:36:04.201
And you can change that.

2086
01:36:04.235 --> 01:36:07.638
There's an opportunity here
for us to take the wisdom


2087
01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:09.473
that we know works,
what we would do


2088
01:36:09.506 --> 01:36:11.575
for our own kids if our own kids
were in trouble,


2089
01:36:11.608 --> 01:36:13.410
and do it
for everybody's kids.


2090
01:36:15.179 --> 01:36:18.115
We need to end the war on drugs.

2091
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:20.751
We have to demand
once and for all


2092
01:36:20.784 --> 01:36:25.389
an end to policing
and prisons for profit.


2093
01:36:25.422 --> 01:36:28.325
At least half of the people
in there are in there


2094
01:36:28.359 --> 01:36:30.061
for crimes of addiction

2095
01:36:30.094 --> 01:36:32.296
or economic desperation
or mental health.


2096
01:36:32.329 --> 01:36:34.198
Instead of just throwing
everybody


2097
01:36:34.231 --> 01:36:36.100
that we've decided
we can't help into prison...


2098
01:36:36.133 --> 01:36:39.370
Use the money for restorative
justice programs,


2099
01:36:39.403 --> 01:36:42.706
rehabs, and social services.

2100
01:36:42.739 --> 01:36:45.276
There has to be
citizen oversight


2101
01:36:45.309 --> 01:36:48.345
and accountability
for all our public servants.


2102
01:36:48.379 --> 01:36:50.681
Luckily for us, we have access
to all of the data.


2103
01:36:50.714 --> 01:36:54.185
If you have any interest
in justice or equal access


2104
01:36:54.218 --> 01:36:55.819
to opportunity in this country,

2105
01:36:55.852 --> 01:36:57.688
all the data,
luckily, is out there.


2106
01:36:57.721 --> 01:37:00.391
It's just a matter
of whether you give a shit.


2107
01:37:00.424 --> 01:37:04.228
Our survival depends
on being logical.


2108
01:37:04.261 --> 01:37:08.132
Our survival depends
on being smart.


2109
01:37:08.165 --> 01:37:13.204
And our survival depends
on love...


2110
01:37:13.237 --> 01:37:15.806
for each other....

2111
01:37:15.839 --> 01:37:18.175
And, um...

2112
01:37:18.209 --> 01:37:20.344
love for yourself.

2113
01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:25.582
[female reporter] And a good
Monday morning to you.


2114
01:37:25.616 --> 01:37:29.420
California man finally free
after serving 16 years


2115
01:37:29.453 --> 01:37:31.555
for a crime he didn't commit.

2116
01:37:31.588 --> 01:37:33.390
[Reggie] I didn't think
it was real until I saw


2117
01:37:33.424 --> 01:37:36.660
my attorneys in visiting, and--

2118
01:37:36.693 --> 01:37:39.130
I'm trying to describe
the feeling.


2119
01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:45.102
It was an unbelievable feeling.

2120
01:37:45.136 --> 01:37:49.340
It was just an emotional
roller coaster that, you know--


2121
01:37:49.373 --> 01:37:51.308
I mean,
I cried walking out.


2122
01:37:51.342 --> 01:37:55.512
It was just the magnitude
of all these years


2123
01:37:55.546 --> 01:37:57.614
and, like, now here it is.

2124
01:37:57.648 --> 01:37:59.616
And then a moment later,

2125
01:37:59.650 --> 01:38:01.518
I would be too bewildered
to cry


2126
01:38:01.552 --> 01:38:04.288
and I would just be--
[chuckles]


2127
01:38:07.891 --> 01:38:10.627
That-- that whole day
was really scary for me.


2128
01:38:10.661 --> 01:38:13.730
A lot of people, like,
think that they would be like,


2129
01:38:13.764 --> 01:38:18.569
"Yay," but I was terrified.

2130
01:38:18.602 --> 01:38:21.805
There were well-wishers--
well-wishers there of officers


2131
01:38:21.838 --> 01:38:24.841
that knew the--
I think they knew the truth


2132
01:38:24.875 --> 01:38:27.144
and certainly knew
the character,


2133
01:38:27.178 --> 01:38:28.612
you know, my character.

2134
01:38:28.645 --> 01:38:30.581
And then
I was in the parking lot.


2135
01:38:34.251 --> 01:38:36.853
The air smelled different.

2136
01:38:36.887 --> 01:38:38.522
I wish my mom
could've been there.


2137
01:38:38.555 --> 01:38:40.257
I wish my dad
could've been there.


2138
01:38:40.291 --> 01:38:41.492
I wish my stepmom
could've been there.


2139
01:38:45.562 --> 01:38:47.298
But I think in a way they were.

2140
01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.469
And it was good.
It was good.


2141
01:38:54.705 --> 01:38:58.609
Like, once I got on the other
side with my attorneys,


2142
01:38:58.642 --> 01:39:01.512
I just felt like running,
like just getting as far away


2143
01:39:01.545 --> 01:39:03.814
from that place
as I possibly could.


2144
01:39:03.847 --> 01:39:06.550
That's probably not the answer

2145
01:39:06.583 --> 01:39:09.453
that everybody would think
that I would have.


2146
01:39:09.486 --> 01:39:14.491
But... it wasn't
a joyous time for me.


2147
01:39:14.525 --> 01:39:16.827
I mean, like, I literally
was scared to death.


2148
01:39:16.860 --> 01:39:18.629
My cousin was waiting for me.

2149
01:39:18.662 --> 01:39:20.631
My private investigator
was waiting for me,


2150
01:39:20.664 --> 01:39:24.835
and I said-- you want to hear
what I actually said?


2151
01:39:24.868 --> 01:39:30.341
[laughs] And I looked at Paul,
and I said, you know...


2152
01:39:30.374 --> 01:39:31.875
"Let's get this stuff
in the truck


2153
01:39:31.908 --> 01:39:34.245
and get the fuck out of here."
[laughs]


2154
01:39:34.278 --> 01:39:36.480
And we couldn't leave
fast enough.


2155
01:39:38.882 --> 01:39:42.686
The first place we stopped
at was IHOP for some breakfast.


2156
01:39:42.719 --> 01:39:48.392
And I was, like,
amazed at just the syrup menu.


2157
01:39:48.425 --> 01:39:51.662
[laughs] It just was
overwhelming, like,


2158
01:39:51.695 --> 01:39:53.330
it was completely overwhelming.

2159
01:39:57.601 --> 01:39:59.870
[Bruce] I haven't been
in a vehicle


2160
01:39:59.903 --> 01:40:03.707
without being chained at my feet
and with a waist chain


2161
01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:06.377
and then handcuffs hooked
to the waist chain


2162
01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:10.314
and in a paper jumpsuit
for 26 years.


2163
01:40:13.517 --> 01:40:15.486
* I am a man

2164
01:40:15.519 --> 01:40:17.521
* I am a man

2165
01:40:17.554 --> 01:40:19.723
* I am a man

2166
01:40:19.756 --> 01:40:23.894
* I am a man
'cause you said I am *


2167
01:40:26.463 --> 01:40:29.800
The word "adjustment," I mean--
[clears throat]


2168
01:40:29.833 --> 01:40:32.569
I try to--
I try to figure that word out.


2169
01:40:32.603 --> 01:40:34.538
Do I have to--

2170
01:40:34.571 --> 01:40:37.941
I'm still trying to figure
that word out.


2171
01:40:37.974 --> 01:40:41.945
Like, how do you adjust coming
from the planet Mars to Earth?


2172
01:40:41.978 --> 01:40:45.382
I don't even think the oxygen
is the same up there.


2173
01:40:45.416 --> 01:40:47.351
I don't think
I'm adjusted at all.


2174
01:40:47.384 --> 01:40:51.522
* It's impossible
to be invincible *


2175
01:40:54.024 --> 01:40:58.629
* But maybe it's possible
to be impossible *


2176
01:40:58.662 --> 01:41:00.564
* I am a man

2177
01:41:00.597 --> 01:41:02.699
* I am a man

2178
01:41:02.733 --> 01:41:04.768
* I am a man

2179
01:41:04.801 --> 01:41:08.972
* I am a man
'cause you said I am *


2180
01:41:10.707 --> 01:41:12.042
* Yeah

2181
01:41:14.878 --> 01:41:17.013
* I am a man

2182
01:41:17.047 --> 01:41:19.082
* I am a man

2183
01:41:19.115 --> 01:41:21.418
* I am a man

2184
01:41:21.452 --> 01:41:25.656
* I am a man
'cause you said I am *


2185
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:28.592
* Yeah

2186
01:41:30.727 --> 01:41:33.364
* Oooh

2187
01:41:56.820 --> 01:42:01.024
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2188
01:42:01.057 --> 01:42:04.395
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2189
01:42:04.428 --> 01:42:07.398
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2190
01:42:07.431 --> 01:42:10.534
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2191
01:42:10.567 --> 01:42:13.604
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2192
01:42:13.637 --> 01:42:16.740
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2193
01:42:16.773 --> 01:42:19.810
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2194
01:42:19.843 --> 01:42:22.979
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2195
01:42:23.013 --> 01:42:26.016
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2196
01:42:26.049 --> 01:42:29.386
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2197
01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:32.523
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2198
01:42:32.556 --> 01:42:35.559
* Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

2199
01:42:35.592 --> 01:42:38.562
* Ohh, ohh, ohh...
