1
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.405
Get up, girl. Get up!

2
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:31.918
Whoa!

3
00:00:49.687 --> 00:00:50.937
Little Josey!

4
00:00:53.774 --> 00:00:56.526
Come on in. Let's get you cleaned up.

5
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.447
Better go.

6
00:01:13.127 --> 00:01:14.669
Whoa.

7
00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:16.230
Pa! Help!
Josey!


8
00:02:16.482 --> 00:02:19.400
Josey! No, no!

9
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.278
Josey! No!

10
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.989
Josey!

11
00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:28.075
Josey! No!

12
00:02:28.243 --> 00:02:30.369
Josey! No!

13
00:02:30.704 --> 00:02:33.539
Pa! Pa!

14
00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:37.335
No!
Pa!


15
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:09.385
Ashes to ashes...

16
00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.639
...dust to dust...

17
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:17.476
...the Lord gives...

18
00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:21.522
...the Lord takes away.

19
00:06:22.728 --> 00:06:24.603
The name's Anderson.

20
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.525
Bloody Bill is what they call me.

21
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:36.032
Redlegs?

22
00:06:38.618 --> 00:06:40.453
You'll find them up in Kansas.

23
00:06:41.955 --> 00:06:43.622
They're with the Union.

24
00:06:45.542 --> 00:06:47.877
And we're going up there
and set things aright.


25
00:06:53.175 --> 00:06:54.341
I'll be coming with you.

26
00:10:35.272 --> 00:10:37.356
All that a fellow has to do...

27
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:41.193
...is ride into that Union camp
down there...


28
00:10:42.404 --> 00:10:46.991
...raise his right hand and swear
you'll be loyal to the United States.


29
00:10:48.368 --> 00:10:50.786
Then he can take up his horse again...

30
00:10:51.538 --> 00:10:53.205
...and go home.

31
00:10:57.919 --> 00:10:59.878
They'll give us full amnesty then?

32
00:11:01.548 --> 00:11:02.589
Yep.

33
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.385
Everyone else has done it but us.

34
00:11:08.888 --> 00:11:10.723
We're the last of the holdouts.

35
00:11:22.777 --> 00:11:24.445
I'm going in. I've had enough.

36
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.789
Josey?

37
00:12:20.627 --> 00:12:22.836
Better go with them, boy.

38
00:12:43.108 --> 00:12:44.316
You coming with us?

39
00:12:48.154 --> 00:12:49.613
I reckon not, Fletcher.

40
00:12:50.198 --> 00:12:51.657
They'll be coming after you.

41
00:12:53.827 --> 00:12:54.910
Yep.

42
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.996
There's nowhere to go to get away.

43
00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:02.835
I reckon that's true.

44
00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:09.341
Well, good luck.

45
00:14:41.017 --> 00:14:42.935
Put the rifle down too.

46
00:14:44.103 --> 00:14:46.939
- I'll need it for squirrels and such.
- Put it down.


47
00:14:52.737 --> 00:14:56.323
Kind of young, ain't you kid,
to be riding with this rabble?


48
00:14:56.783 --> 00:15:00.661
Who you calling rabble,
you blue scumbelly?


49
00:15:02.956 --> 00:15:06.375
Hell, we showed these boys, anyway.

50
00:15:06.626 --> 00:15:09.169
Lee might have had to surrender,
but we didn't.


51
00:15:09.504 --> 00:15:11.129
- Shut up, kid.
- Yes, sir.


52
00:15:11.381 --> 00:15:12.881
You showed us.

53
00:15:13.258 --> 00:15:14.633
Now get in line...

54
00:15:14.842 --> 00:15:17.803
...before I kick you so hard
you'll wear your ass for a hat.


55
00:15:28.314 --> 00:15:30.274
Here's the man you asked for, sir.

56
00:15:30.817 --> 00:15:33.485
- Fletcher. Good to see you.
- Senator.


57
00:15:33.695 --> 00:15:34.778
Well done.

58
00:15:34.988 --> 00:15:36.071
Thank you.

59
00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:42.703
What the hell is
this Redleg doing here?


60
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.000
You said regular federal authorities
would handle this.


61
00:15:48.835 --> 00:15:52.588
Captain Terrill is the regular
federal authority now.


62
00:15:53.006 --> 00:15:56.425
Captain Terrill is
a bloodthirsty son of a bitch!


63
00:15:56.676 --> 00:15:58.927
He is a looter and a pillager!

64
00:15:59.178 --> 00:16:00.887
He's the worst enemy those men have!

65
00:16:03.182 --> 00:16:04.808
The war's over.

66
00:16:05.685 --> 00:16:08.186
Our side won the war.

67
00:16:09.063 --> 00:16:11.857
Now we must busy ourselves
winning the peace.


68
00:16:12.108 --> 00:16:16.862
And, Fletcher, there's an old saying:
To the victors belong the spoils.


69
00:16:24.329 --> 00:16:26.747
And there's another old saying, senator.

70
00:16:27.206 --> 00:16:30.042
Don't piss down my back
and tell me it's raining.


71
00:16:31.044 --> 00:16:33.462
Which side is this man on, senator?

72
00:16:33.713 --> 00:16:35.881
Easy. He brought them all in, didn't he?

73
00:16:36.132 --> 00:16:37.924
- All but one.
- Who's that?


74
00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:39.926
Josey Wales.

75
00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.389
Josey Wales.

76
00:16:50.772 --> 00:16:54.900
Captain Terrill, I want you to
currycomb the countryside.


77
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.403
You beat the brush and root out
everything disloyal...


78
00:16:58.738 --> 00:17:02.074
...from a Shanghai rooster
to a Durham cow!


79
00:17:02.283 --> 00:17:05.285
We've got to clean up this country.

80
00:17:05.912 --> 00:17:10.791
Now you take five men and go up there
and get Josey Wales.


81
00:17:12.877 --> 00:17:17.798
Captain Redlegs Terrill and five men
against Josey Wales?


82
00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:22.969
We stopped those bushwhackers
pretty good during the war.


83
00:17:23.971 --> 00:17:27.891
Fletcher, you go with Captain Terrill.

84
00:17:28.601 --> 00:17:31.436
Bring in this damn
insurrectionist rebel.


85
00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:33.605
Now, here.

86
00:17:34.315 --> 00:17:36.441
Here's the money for bringing
the others...


87
00:17:36.693 --> 00:17:39.277
...and there'll be more for Josey Wales.

88
00:17:45.952 --> 00:17:48.161
I've had enough of your money, senator.

89
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.455
Let Wales be.

90
00:17:50.707 --> 00:17:52.207
Let me be.

91
00:17:53.334 --> 00:17:54.918
I'm finished with you.

92
00:18:06.055 --> 00:18:07.222
All right...

93
00:18:08.558 --> 00:18:12.978
...I want you men to raise
your right hands.


94
00:18:13.187 --> 00:18:14.479
What for?

95
00:18:15.148 --> 00:18:18.150
So you can pledge loyalty
to the Union.


96
00:18:18.651 --> 00:18:21.153
Hell, pledge loyalty to the Union?

97
00:18:21.362 --> 00:18:23.822
You ought to have us turn around
and bend over.


98
00:18:26.325 --> 00:18:29.536
All raise your right hands
so I can take your oath.


99
00:18:31.372 --> 00:18:32.539
I pledge...

100
00:18:32.832 --> 00:18:36.334
...that I will be loyal to
the United States of America.


101
00:18:36.544 --> 00:18:39.171
I pledge that I will be loyal...

102
00:18:39.464 --> 00:18:42.090
...to the United States of America.

103
00:18:43.259 --> 00:18:44.718
That I will...

104
00:18:46.262 --> 00:18:49.097
Let's see. I will abide by its law...

105
00:18:49.348 --> 00:18:51.433
...that I will never bear arms against it.

106
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:53.685
I will abide by its law...

107
00:18:53.853 --> 00:18:57.272
...that I will never bear arms
against it.


108
00:18:59.358 --> 00:19:00.859
And recognize...

109
00:19:02.195 --> 00:19:03.528
...that it is one nation.

110
00:19:04.864 --> 00:19:06.031
And recognize...

111
00:19:06.365 --> 00:19:07.699
...that it is one nation.

112
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:09.701
- I ain't doing it.
Come on, kid.


113
00:19:09.911 --> 00:19:12.078
Let's get this over with, damn it!

114
00:19:12.371 --> 00:19:13.914
But I been thinking.

115
00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:17.083
I think it's them who owes an apology.

116
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:20.420
And I further swear, that though...

117
00:19:20.713 --> 00:19:21.713
...I be murderous...

118
00:19:24.383 --> 00:19:26.051
Look! That's Josey!

119
00:19:30.932 --> 00:19:34.059
Verminous, lying, 
Missouri scum!

120
00:20:06.926 --> 00:20:08.593
Damn you, senator!

121
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.430
You promised me those men would be
decently treated.


122
00:20:12.682 --> 00:20:14.933
They were decently treated.

123
00:20:15.184 --> 00:20:17.269
They were decently fed...

124
00:20:17.478 --> 00:20:19.604
...and then they were decently shot.

125
00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:22.774
These men are common outlaws,
nothing more.


126
00:21:24.837 --> 00:21:27.213
Run for it, Fletcher, it's a trap!

127
00:21:43.439 --> 00:21:45.857
Josey, we best be on our way.

128
00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:48.693
- Get moving, boy.
- They're coming after us.


129
00:21:48.903 --> 00:21:50.737
We've got to take to the brush!

130
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.239
- You get going!
- You can't get them all.


131
00:21:53.532 --> 00:21:56.368
- That's a fact.
- How come you're doing this then?


132
00:21:57.787 --> 00:21:59.579
I've got nothing better to do.

133
00:21:59.872 --> 00:22:02.374
Fletcher was in with them.
It was a trap!


134
00:22:03.376 --> 00:22:04.751
Fletcher?

135
00:22:05.586 --> 00:22:07.379
Never would have figured that.

136
00:22:13.177 --> 00:22:15.178
You dumb kid.

137
00:22:16.055 --> 00:22:18.807
Josey, I've got to tell you something.

138
00:22:19.892 --> 00:22:21.476
I'm scared of dying.

139
00:22:22.228 --> 00:22:23.478
Move out!

140
00:22:55.302 --> 00:22:57.595
You are going after him after all.

141
00:22:58.264 --> 00:23:00.598
Fletcher, I'm giving you a commission.

142
00:23:01.517 --> 00:23:04.936
Hound this Wales to kingdom come.

143
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.106
Hound him, senator?

144
00:23:09.108 --> 00:23:12.110
A man like Wales lives by the feud.

145
00:23:13.487 --> 00:23:16.614
Because of what you did here today,
I've got to kill that man.


146
00:23:16.824 --> 00:23:20.452
Well, he'll have to run for it now.

147
00:23:21.287 --> 00:23:23.997
And hell is where he's headed.

148
00:23:25.166 --> 00:23:27.459
He'll be waiting there for us, senator.

149
00:23:32.882 --> 00:23:35.133
Don't hold back on account
of me. I can ride.


150
00:23:35.384 --> 00:23:39.304
I ain't holding back on account of you,
you thick-headed grasshopper.


151
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.142
If we ride in the open, there's enough
posses over in South Missouri...


152
00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:46.352
...to start another war.

153
00:23:46.771 --> 00:23:49.397
And if we try riding
instead of thinking...


154
00:23:50.024 --> 00:23:53.860
...well, we'll end up hanging
by a rope by nightfall.


155
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:57.405
- Where are we headed?
- The Indian Nations.


156
00:23:57.656 --> 00:24:00.992
It's a good place to hole up
and get you healed up.


157
00:24:01.202 --> 00:24:02.660
Then we'll go get Fletcher?

158
00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:06.039
Right, boy.

159
00:24:06.582 --> 00:24:09.000
Then we go back and get Fletcher.

160
00:24:20.179 --> 00:24:22.597
There's some riders
coming up behind us.


161
00:24:56.132 --> 00:24:58.424
Get down here, boy.
Lay across his neck.


162
00:24:58.717 --> 00:25:00.343
Keep him down there.

163
00:25:15.484 --> 00:25:17.402
Can you hear me, boy?

164
00:25:18.237 --> 00:25:22.073
Now if you see me get up,
you stay there, understand?


165
00:25:22.366 --> 00:25:24.450
If you hear shooting
and me headed back north...


166
00:25:24.743 --> 00:25:27.245
...get back on that horse.
He'll get up with you...


167
00:25:27.496 --> 00:25:29.581
...and you head south, now you hear?

168
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.674
Whoa. Whoa.

169
00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:48.933
You can let him up now, boy.

170
00:25:50.144 --> 00:25:51.519
Let him up!

171
00:25:52.771 --> 00:25:54.272
Get up, goddamn it!

172
00:25:58.944 --> 00:26:00.987
Whupped them again, didn't we?

173
00:26:03.449 --> 00:26:04.991
Whupped them again, boy.

174
00:26:16.629 --> 00:26:20.173
Ten years I've been ferrying
Kansas Redlegs...


175
00:26:20.466 --> 00:26:23.635
...Union Cavalry, 
Missouri guerrillas...

176
00:26:23.928 --> 00:26:25.511
...you name it!

177
00:26:25.804 --> 00:26:27.722
Mad dogs, them guerrillas!

178
00:26:27.973 --> 00:26:30.183
You look sideways at them...

179
00:26:30.476 --> 00:26:32.060
...they kill you!

180
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.812
Hard men to do business with.

181
00:26:35.022 --> 00:26:36.356
You bet!

182
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:38.566
You know, in my line of work...

183
00:26:38.817 --> 00:26:42.320
...you got to be able either to sing
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic"...


184
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:45.573
...or "Dixie" with equal enthusiasm...

185
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:48.534
...depending upon present company.

186
00:26:49.161 --> 00:26:52.080
Can't say as I blame you for that.

187
00:26:52.373 --> 00:26:55.333
Only good business to play it safe.

188
00:26:55.542 --> 00:26:58.378
Thank God they all been disarmed now...

189
00:26:58.587 --> 00:27:00.838
...except for a few of the nastiest ones...

190
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.466
...who they're busy running down.

191
00:27:03.676 --> 00:27:07.095
Where I'm going,
they know how to handle that kind.


192
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.180
Where are you headed?

193
00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:11.557
I'm going to ply
my wares down in Texas.


194
00:27:12.476 --> 00:27:14.185
Texas, huh?

195
00:27:15.688 --> 00:27:17.855
How much for the ferry ride?

196
00:27:18.065 --> 00:27:19.732
Ten cents.

197
00:27:20.234 --> 00:27:24.696
By coincidence, I happen to have
a bottle of this remarkable elixir...


198
00:27:24.905 --> 00:27:26.864
...I could let you have
for that exact amount.


199
00:27:27.032 --> 00:27:29.575
I wish I was
in the land of cotton

200
00:27:29.868 --> 00:27:32.537
Old times there is not forgotten

201
00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:35.206
Look away, look away

202
00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:37.750
Look away, Dixieland

203
00:27:38.085 --> 00:27:41.212
- Howdy.
- Howdy there.


204
00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.715
Sim Carstairs is the name.

205
00:27:43.924 --> 00:27:45.049
Mister...?

206
00:27:45.718 --> 00:27:48.052
Figured we'd give you some
ferrying business.


207
00:27:49.054 --> 00:27:50.722
With pleasure!

208
00:27:51.515 --> 00:27:55.727
Bill Quantrill used this ferry
all the time.


209
00:27:56.312 --> 00:27:57.770
Good friend of mine.

210
00:27:58.772 --> 00:28:00.064
What have you got there?

211
00:28:01.275 --> 00:28:04.527
Just the store with
Grannie Hawkins up there.


212
00:28:05.654 --> 00:28:07.613
I'll tell you what.

213
00:28:07.906 --> 00:28:10.658
We'll all just amble
over to that store.


214
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:13.661
Him and me will ride.
We've got a touch of the cramp.


215
00:28:13.829 --> 00:28:15.246
Stranger, you're in luck!

216
00:28:15.414 --> 00:28:18.458
I just happen to have the perfect thing
here for cramps.


217
00:28:20.336 --> 00:28:22.420
We'll need half a side of bacon...

218
00:28:23.088 --> 00:28:26.424
...10 pounds of beef jerky,

219
00:28:26.633 --> 00:28:30.428
And when we get over there, there won't
be any need for you to go inside.


220
00:28:30.804 --> 00:28:34.599
Just tell Old Grannie through the door
we'll need a lot of clean bandages...


221
00:28:34.808 --> 00:28:38.978
...and a boiled poultice for a
bullet wound in a hurry. Come on.


222
00:28:53.994 --> 00:28:56.329
So you'll be Josey Wales.

223
00:28:58.707 --> 00:29:00.708
How might you know that, Grannie?

224
00:29:00.959 --> 00:29:03.461
Soldiers were here looking
for you two hours ago.


225
00:29:04.797 --> 00:29:08.299
I was going to mention that to you
as soon as I got the chance.


226
00:29:08.592 --> 00:29:10.301
They say you killed your own men.

227
00:29:10.594 --> 00:29:12.720
Those lying blue scumbellies!

228
00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:16.015
They say you're a hard-put
and desperate man.


229
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:19.977
They're going to heel and hog you
to a barn door.


230
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.649
- You know what I say?
- What's that?


231
00:29:24.858 --> 00:29:27.652
I say that big talk's worth diddlysquat.

232
00:29:27.903 --> 00:29:31.989
Now them poultices be laced with
feather moss and mustard root.


233
00:29:32.241 --> 00:29:35.827
Mind you drop water on them
occasionally and keep them damp.


234
00:29:36.745 --> 00:29:37.870
Much obliged, Grannie.

235
00:29:38.163 --> 00:29:41.374
You can pay me when you see me again,
Josey Wales.


236
00:29:44.169 --> 00:29:45.837
I reckon so.

237
00:29:48.757 --> 00:29:51.384
There's buckwheat cakes
And injun batter


238
00:29:51.677 --> 00:29:54.762
Makes you fat or a little fatter

239
00:29:55.013 --> 00:29:59.642
Look away, look away, look away
Dixieland


240
00:30:01.687 --> 00:30:05.273
That sure is a sweet sound
to the ears...


241
00:30:05.524 --> 00:30:07.775
...wouldn't you say so, Mr. Wales?

242
00:30:08.026 --> 00:30:10.027
Your young friend can use some help.

243
00:30:10.237 --> 00:30:12.029
This is it. One dollar a bottle.

244
00:30:12.239 --> 00:30:14.407
It works wonders on wounds.

245
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.701
Works wonders on
just about everything.


246
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.036
It can do most anything.

247
00:30:20.873 --> 00:30:22.748
How is it with stains?

248
00:30:36.763 --> 00:30:38.556
Here we go.

249
00:30:38.807 --> 00:30:43.978
Come on, come on. Yeah.

250
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.898
Yeah.

251
00:30:52.571 --> 00:30:55.781
Dismount. Disembark, children.

252
00:30:57.493 --> 00:30:58.743
Get that back!

253
00:30:58.994 --> 00:31:00.495
Bring it back!

254
00:31:01.705 --> 00:31:03.414
Bring that barge back!

255
00:31:04.291 --> 00:31:06.083
Bring it back!

256
00:31:06.293 --> 00:31:08.211
Whupped them again, Josey.

257
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.755
They're hollering for me to come over!

258
00:31:11.215 --> 00:31:13.216
I can't hold on.

259
00:31:13.926 --> 00:31:17.595
But I'll hold on until you fellows
get out of sight.


260
00:31:17.804 --> 00:31:19.305
All right?

261
00:31:19.598 --> 00:31:21.599
I'll make do something's wrong-

262
00:31:21.808 --> 00:31:23.267
Pull, Lemuel. Pull!

263
00:31:23.477 --> 00:31:27.104
I'll make do something's wrong,
until you get going.


264
00:31:27.773 --> 00:31:30.608
I wish you all lots of luck.

265
00:31:30.984 --> 00:31:33.236
Pull, Lemuel, pull!

266
00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:37.782
Oh I wish I was
in the land of cotton

267
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.867
He ain't going to hold up no ferry.

268
00:31:40.118 --> 00:31:43.246
He's going to bring that cavalry
over fast as he can.


269
00:31:43.455 --> 00:31:45.122
Yeah.

270
00:31:45.332 --> 00:31:49.168
Reckon there's a nice reward out
for us about now.


271
00:31:50.796 --> 00:31:55.299
Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord


272
00:31:56.051 --> 00:31:58.636
He is trampling out the vintage...

273
00:32:00.055 --> 00:32:01.514
We got him now.

274
00:32:01.807 --> 00:32:04.392
We'll get those two first,
then the others.


275
00:32:04.643 --> 00:32:05.977
What others?

276
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.312
Wales and the kid are the last ones.

277
00:32:08.522 --> 00:32:11.983
Oh, no. Texas is full of rebels.

278
00:32:12.192 --> 00:32:14.193
Lots of work to do down in Texas.

279
00:32:14.486 --> 00:32:16.821
We get Josey Wales and it ends.

280
00:32:18.156 --> 00:32:20.157
Doing right ain't got no end.

281
00:32:26.665 --> 00:32:28.666
We best hurry on, Josey.

282
00:32:29.334 --> 00:32:32.336
They'd catch up to us
by the end of the day.


283
00:32:32.588 --> 00:32:35.047
Judging by these tracks,
there's maybe...


284
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.842
...40, 50 horses ahead of us.

285
00:32:38.093 --> 00:32:42.096
What we've got to do is space some time
between them and us.


286
00:32:43.181 --> 00:32:44.849
What are we going to do?

287
00:32:45.934 --> 00:32:47.602
Stay right here.

288
00:32:50.188 --> 00:32:51.439
Welcome.

289
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.900
Welcome, gentlemen.
Please come aboard.


290
00:32:55.944 --> 00:32:57.403
Howdy.

291
00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:08.748
Pull, Lemuel.

292
00:33:08.957 --> 00:33:11.125
- He's still there.
Still there?


293
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.377
What does he think he's doing?

294
00:33:14.046 --> 00:33:15.379
Don't know.

295
00:33:15.631 --> 00:33:18.215
Some of you men get down there.
Prepare to fire.


296
00:33:20.052 --> 00:33:21.594
Captain Redlegs...

297
00:33:22.596 --> 00:33:23.971
...I advise you to turn back.

298
00:33:24.222 --> 00:33:25.890
You can catch him later.

299
00:33:26.141 --> 00:33:28.893
Turn back? Are you crazy?

300
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:31.103
He'll try to pick
us off one by one.

301
00:33:32.064 --> 00:33:33.356
He'll never do it.

302
00:33:33.565 --> 00:33:35.566
At best, he'll get two
or three up front.


303
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:42.365
- I advise you to turn back, captain.
- They're coming.


304
00:34:08.266 --> 00:34:11.268
Do you really think you can shoot
all those men down...


305
00:34:11.478 --> 00:34:13.312
...before they shoot you?

306
00:34:13.522 --> 00:34:17.274
Oh, no, no, Mr. Josey Wales!

307
00:34:17.484 --> 00:34:21.445
There is such a thing in this country
called justice.


308
00:34:23.782 --> 00:34:26.033
Well, Mr. Carpetbagger...

309
00:34:26.451 --> 00:34:28.953
...we've got something in this territory...

310
00:34:30.956 --> 00:34:32.998
...called the Missouri boat ride.

311
00:34:43.468 --> 00:34:45.636
Watch out! Back him up!

312
00:34:56.148 --> 00:34:57.189
God Almighty!

313
00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:06.949
Watch out for that horse!
Watch out, you stupid son of a bitch!


314
00:35:31.266 --> 00:35:32.516
Is it bad, Josey?

315
00:35:32.684 --> 00:35:34.101
It's bad.

316
00:35:35.479 --> 00:35:37.104
Don't look at it, boy.

317
00:35:37.522 --> 00:35:40.232
It'll just make you get feelings in it.

318
00:35:44.237 --> 00:35:46.489
If I don't make it...

319
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.365
...I want you to know...

320
00:35:48.575 --> 00:35:51.202
...I'm prouder than a game rooster
to have rid with you.


321
00:35:51.995 --> 00:35:53.788
You are a game rooster.
Now shut up.


322
00:35:54.873 --> 00:35:58.542
- You could make it without me.
- Here.


323
00:35:59.586 --> 00:36:01.504
Take a little drink of this.

324
00:36:15.811 --> 00:36:19.063
This here linsey-woolsey shirt I got
that all you boys wore.


325
00:36:20.315 --> 00:36:22.399
We didn't have no ma.

326
00:36:24.569 --> 00:36:27.738
So Pa did all the
fancy needlework for me.


327
00:36:30.242 --> 00:36:32.326
Told me not to tell no one.

328
00:36:35.247 --> 00:36:39.124
Imagine a grown man doing that
for his own kid?


329
00:36:41.419 --> 00:36:44.129
Sang a little song while he sewed it.

330
00:36:45.257 --> 00:36:49.176
You know "Rose of Alabama," Josey?

331
00:36:50.554 --> 00:36:53.055
River rolled
The crickets sang


332
00:36:53.265 --> 00:36:56.350
The lightning bug
He flashed his wing


333
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.353
And I could rope
My arms I fling


334
00:36:59.604 --> 00:37:02.273
Round rose of Alabama

335
00:37:03.608 --> 00:37:05.860
Oh, brown rosie

336
00:37:06.111 --> 00:37:08.487
Rose of Alabama

337
00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:13.868
A sweet tobacco posy
Is the rose of Alabama


338
00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:17.955
Now you just do that, cousin.
You bring that old pistol right out.


339
00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:20.875
We got him, Lige.

340
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.627
It's him, Abe. It's him.

341
00:37:23.837 --> 00:37:25.462
We got the Josey Wales, Abe!

342
00:37:25.714 --> 00:37:29.300
I seen him ride side by side
with Bloody Bill.


343
00:37:29.801 --> 00:37:31.302
We got reward money coming.

344
00:37:32.387 --> 00:37:35.973
Watch it. He's meaner than
a rattler and twice as fast!


345
00:37:36.224 --> 00:37:39.602
You're a real bush hog,
ain't you, Mr. Josey Wales?


346
00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:40.811
Tell you what.

347
00:37:41.229 --> 00:37:43.814
Move on back. Move on back!

348
00:37:44.024 --> 00:37:46.150
Watch him.
I seen him do some things.


349
00:37:46.401 --> 00:37:47.818
Shut up, Lige!

350
00:37:53.617 --> 00:37:54.992
Now...

351
00:37:55.869 --> 00:37:57.703
...Mr. Josey Wales...

352
00:37:58.163 --> 00:37:59.747
...I'd just as soon shoot you now...

353
00:37:59.998 --> 00:38:03.834
...except it'd be hard to drag your body
to where we can get our price for you.


354
00:38:04.127 --> 00:38:07.004
- Shoot him now!
- Shut up, Lige.


355
00:38:08.256 --> 00:38:12.176
Move your left hand down
and unbuckle that pistol belt.


356
00:38:13.428 --> 00:38:15.429
Make it nice and slow...

357
00:38:15.847 --> 00:38:18.182
...so I can count the hairs
on that hand.


358
00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.872
See, Lige?

359
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:45.376
You pull his teeth...

360
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.671
...he's harmless as a heel hound.

361
00:38:50.548 --> 00:38:54.593
Always wanted to face out one of these
pistol fighters they all fuss about.


362
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.179
Only way you handle them.

363
00:38:57.389 --> 00:38:59.390
Abe, watch out.

364
00:38:59.891 --> 00:39:02.559
- He's probably got another pistol-
- Shut up, Lige.


365
00:39:03.228 --> 00:39:05.896
Call Benny back there on the horse.

366
00:39:06.439 --> 00:39:08.565
Benny! Come out!

367
00:39:09.067 --> 00:39:11.110
We got us the Josey Wales!

368
00:39:11.403 --> 00:39:13.821
Oh, brown rosie

369
00:39:14.072 --> 00:39:16.240
Rose of Alabamy

370
00:39:16.408 --> 00:39:17.825
Who is that?

371
00:39:19.494 --> 00:39:21.620
He's just a boy. 
He's got a fever.

372
00:39:22.789 --> 00:39:23.914
Tell him to shut up.

373
00:39:24.416 --> 00:39:26.917
Sweet tobacco posies-

374
00:39:29.129 --> 00:39:30.295
Pa?

375
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.755
Is that you, Pa?

376
00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:35.426
It ain't your pa! Now shut up!

377
00:39:35.969 --> 00:39:37.261
Pa.

378
00:39:37.512 --> 00:39:39.471
I got the gold right here, Pa.

379
00:39:40.932 --> 00:39:42.599
What gold is he talking about?

380
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:45.102
There's no gold. He's crazy.

381
00:39:45.353 --> 00:39:47.646
The gold me and Josey robbed
from the bank.


382
00:39:49.941 --> 00:39:53.986
Lige, take a look under that blanket.

383
00:39:55.864 --> 00:39:57.614
I got it right here.

384
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.802
Thought you could use some help.

385
00:40:20.013 --> 00:40:24.475
You get those holes leaking, I'm going
to whomp you with a knotted plow-line.


386
00:40:25.143 --> 00:40:26.852
They ain't honest.

387
00:40:27.187 --> 00:40:29.813
I feel as pert as a rutting buck.

388
00:40:31.191 --> 00:40:32.316
Good.

389
00:40:33.651 --> 00:40:36.361
Because I ain't hauling you
all over hell's creation...


390
00:40:36.654 --> 00:40:38.989
...dribbling blood over
half of Missouri.


391
00:40:40.992 --> 00:40:43.160
Wish we had time to bury them fellows.

392
00:40:44.162 --> 00:40:46.080
To hell with them fellows.

393
00:40:48.333 --> 00:40:51.502
Buzzards got to eat, same as worms.

394
00:41:13.566 --> 00:41:16.193
A real frog strangler.

395
00:41:17.529 --> 00:41:22.074
Ten, 20 more miles and we'll be
safe in the Nations.


396
00:41:30.542 --> 00:41:33.544
Some cavalry between us
and the Nations.


397
00:41:33.837 --> 00:41:36.130
We'll have to wait till they bed down...

398
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:37.965
...then walk through quiet.

399
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:40.551
Here, have some beef jerky.

400
00:41:41.136 --> 00:41:44.429
Don't swallow nothing but the juice.
I'll go have a look-see.


401
00:41:44.722 --> 00:41:46.140
You feel all right?

402
00:41:46.558 --> 00:41:49.601
I feel real good, Josey.
We got them whupped.


403
00:41:52.397 --> 00:41:55.774
- Josey, I want to thank you.
- For what?


404
00:41:56.734 --> 00:41:58.068
For saving my life.

405
00:41:59.404 --> 00:42:01.155
Forget about that, Jamie.

406
00:42:01.406 --> 00:42:03.240
You know something, Josey?

407
00:42:04.742 --> 00:42:06.285
I ain't scared no more.

408
00:42:11.958 --> 00:42:13.000
All right.

409
00:42:40.987 --> 00:42:43.822
We can start working our way
through now, boy.


410
00:42:44.282 --> 00:42:46.283
This rain is giving us the-

411
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:13.185
This boy was brought up in...

412
00:43:13.728 --> 00:43:16.480
...a time of blood and dying,
and never questioned a bit of it.


413
00:43:17.357 --> 00:43:20.359
Never turned his back
on his folks or his kind.


414
00:43:22.445 --> 00:43:25.656
I rode with him, 
I got no complaints.

415
00:43:26.324 --> 00:43:30.827
The bluebellies will give you
a better burial than I can, boy.


416
00:43:40.338 --> 00:43:41.880
Halt!

417
00:43:42.173 --> 00:43:44.841
- What's going on?
- Come on, get him.


418
00:45:17.602 --> 00:45:20.771
Howdy.
- Howdy.


419
00:45:21.606 --> 00:45:23.607
Name's Josey Wales.

420
00:45:24.609 --> 00:45:26.777
I've heard of that name.

421
00:45:28.112 --> 00:45:30.947
Some said you'd be headed this way.

422
00:45:32.367 --> 00:45:36.620
And they said a man could get rich
on reward money...


423
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:38.330
...if he could kill you.

424
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:42.292
Seems like you was looking
to gain some money here.


425
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.088
Actually, I was looking
to gain an edge.


426
00:45:46.964 --> 00:45:50.967
I thought you might be someone who
would sneak up behind me with a gun.


427
00:45:51.386 --> 00:45:53.804
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?

428
00:45:54.305 --> 00:45:57.140
It ain't supposed to be easy
to sneak up behind an Indian.


429
00:45:58.518 --> 00:46:00.811
I'm an Indian, all right.

430
00:46:01.354 --> 00:46:05.315
But here in the Nation,
they call us the civilized tribe.


431
00:46:06.401 --> 00:46:10.821
They call us civilized because
we're easy to sneak up on.


432
00:46:12.198 --> 00:46:16.326
White men have been sneaking up
on us for years.


433
00:46:17.328 --> 00:46:18.995
Cherokee, huh?

434
00:46:20.331 --> 00:46:21.373
Yeah.

435
00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:26.711
They sneaked up on us and they
told us we wouldn't be happy here.


436
00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.382
They said we would be happier
in the Nations.


437
00:46:31.134 --> 00:46:34.052
So they took away our land...

438
00:46:34.345 --> 00:46:36.179
...and sent us here.

439
00:46:38.182 --> 00:46:40.642
I have a fine woman...

440
00:46:41.686 --> 00:46:43.520
...and two sons.

441
00:46:43.729 --> 00:46:47.065
But they all died
on the Trail of Tears.

442
00:46:49.569 --> 00:46:54.239
And now the white man
is sneaking up on me.


443
00:46:56.075 --> 00:46:57.701
Again.

444
00:47:03.458 --> 00:47:05.917
Seems like we can't trust
the white man.


445
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.462
You bet we can't.

446
00:47:10.882 --> 00:47:12.674
I wore this...

447
00:47:13.468 --> 00:47:16.219
...frock coat in Washington.

448
00:47:16.429 --> 00:47:17.929
Before the war.

449
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.600
We wore them because we belonged to...

450
00:47:21.893 --> 00:47:24.060
...the five civilized tribes.

451
00:47:26.564 --> 00:47:29.608
We dressed ourselves up
like Abraham Lincoln.


452
00:47:33.446 --> 00:47:38.241
We got to see the
Secretary of the Interior.


453
00:47:39.243 --> 00:47:40.827
And he said:

454
00:47:41.954 --> 00:47:44.623
"Boy! You boys sure look civilized!"

455
00:47:46.083 --> 00:47:48.335
He congratulated us...

456
00:47:48.586 --> 00:47:52.464
...and he gave us medals
for looking so civilized.


457
00:47:52.757 --> 00:47:56.426
We told him about how
our land had been stolen...


458
00:47:56.928 --> 00:47:58.970
...and our people were dying.

459
00:48:00.515 --> 00:48:03.350
When we finished,
he shook our hands...


460
00:48:03.643 --> 00:48:04.935
...and said:

461
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:08.813
"Endeavor to persevere."

462
00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.274
They stood us in a line.

463
00:48:11.526 --> 00:48:14.611
John Jumper, Chilly McIntosh...

464
00:48:15.488 --> 00:48:17.113
...Buffalo Hump...

465
00:48:18.658 --> 00:48:21.034
...and Jim Pock Mark and me.

466
00:48:21.285 --> 00:48:22.536
I'm Lone Watie.

467
00:48:22.954 --> 00:48:24.955
They took our pictures.

468
00:48:25.498 --> 00:48:27.791
And the newspaper said:

469
00:48:28.334 --> 00:48:32.963
"Indians Vow to
Endeavor to Persevere."


470
00:48:33.631 --> 00:48:36.132
We thought about it for a long time.

471
00:48:36.801 --> 00:48:39.261
"Endeavor to persevere."

472
00:48:39.804 --> 00:48:43.682
And when we had thought
about it long enough...


473
00:48:44.058 --> 00:48:46.893
...we declared war on the Union.

474
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.911
Sergeant said this kid tried to ride
through their camp. They got him.


475
00:49:06.539 --> 00:49:08.873
- They did, did they?
- Mm-hm.


476
00:49:09.542 --> 00:49:12.002
They've had men on guard here
night and day.


477
00:49:12.336 --> 00:49:14.421
No way Wales could get to the Nations.

478
00:49:20.011 --> 00:49:21.928
Where are you going, Fletcher?

479
00:49:22.179 --> 00:49:24.681
I'm heading into the Indian Nations.

480
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.183
Why don't you stay here, Redlegs?

481
00:49:27.852 --> 00:49:30.312
Wales may be back
in a year or two.

482
00:49:33.608 --> 00:49:36.735
When we get to the Nations,
I want you men to fan out.


483
00:49:37.028 --> 00:49:39.613
Five thousand dollars
to the one who gets him.


484
00:49:59.258 --> 00:50:02.719
A horned toad can tell you
which way to go.


485
00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:06.598
I used to know these things
when I was young.


486
00:50:07.725 --> 00:50:10.727
But when I got civilized,
I forgot all these things.


487
00:50:10.936 --> 00:50:12.896
I didn't know which way to go.

488
00:50:13.272 --> 00:50:16.441
The horned toad says
we should go to Mexico.


489
00:50:24.075 --> 00:50:26.451
Well, Mr. Lone Watie...

490
00:50:28.579 --> 00:50:31.748
...you can take your horned toad
down Mexico way.


491
00:50:32.458 --> 00:50:35.085
I've got some unfinished
business in Missouri.


492
00:50:35.795 --> 00:50:38.254
I heard General Joe Shelby...

493
00:50:38.506 --> 00:50:41.424
...and some men refused to surrender.

494
00:50:41.634 --> 00:50:43.301
They're going down to Mexico.

495
00:50:43.594 --> 00:50:44.928
I think I'll join them.

496
00:50:45.638 --> 00:50:47.013
Shelby, huh?

497
00:50:47.264 --> 00:50:49.265
I didn't know others
hadn't surrendered.


498
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.476
I didn't surrender, neither.

499
00:50:51.769 --> 00:50:55.438
But they took my horse
and made him surrender.


500
00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:58.942
They have him pulling a wagon
up in Kansas, I'll bet.


501
00:51:01.987 --> 00:51:03.780
You haven't got a horse.

502
00:51:04.115 --> 00:51:06.491
What do you plan on doing,
walking to Mexico?


503
00:51:06.784 --> 00:51:09.661
No, there's a trading post
right near the Creek Nation.


504
00:51:09.912 --> 00:51:11.830
They got horses to trade.

505
00:51:13.457 --> 00:51:15.041
You have any food here?

506
00:51:16.669 --> 00:51:19.838
All I have is a
piece of hard rock candy.

507
00:51:21.298 --> 00:51:22.966
But it's not for eating.

508
00:51:23.175 --> 00:51:25.468
It's just for looking through.

509
00:51:28.806 --> 00:51:30.181
Alrighty.

510
00:51:34.353 --> 00:51:36.312
I'll get you a horse.

511
00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:01.087
What have you got there?

512
00:52:01.255 --> 00:52:02.422
Muskrat.

513
00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.174
Muskrat?

514
00:52:04.341 --> 00:52:05.508
What the hell's that?

515
00:52:05.676 --> 00:52:07.010
Muskrat.

516
00:52:07.845 --> 00:52:11.181
No. No, sir.
You got to come up with something more.


517
00:52:11.849 --> 00:52:13.767
- Beaver?
- Beaver ain't no good no more.


518
00:52:14.018 --> 00:52:15.894
Get me 10 muskrats...

519
00:52:16.395 --> 00:52:18.688
...and 30 beaver pelts...

520
00:52:19.023 --> 00:52:21.065
...and I'll give you red cloth.

521
00:52:22.401 --> 00:52:24.861
Now that's a very good bargain for you.

522
00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.532
Here.

523
00:52:29.784 --> 00:52:32.702
You go have a drink
and think about it.


524
00:52:39.877 --> 00:52:41.377
Spilling!

525
00:52:51.096 --> 00:52:53.431
You bring some drink inside, you hear?

526
00:53:03.108 --> 00:53:05.735
I'll tell you, this jerky?

527
00:53:05.945 --> 00:53:07.570
Put it on our bill.

528
00:53:08.405 --> 00:53:10.114
What about these cougar pelts?

529
00:53:10.407 --> 00:53:12.534
Going to put them on our bill too?

530
00:53:16.914 --> 00:53:19.082
This is what you give those Indians.

531
00:53:20.251 --> 00:53:21.417
Where's the real stuff?

532
00:53:38.269 --> 00:53:40.103
What do you take for the squaw?

533
00:53:40.563 --> 00:53:42.272
She ain't for sale.

534
00:53:44.483 --> 00:53:46.609
I mean, she ain't mine.

535
00:53:46.944 --> 00:53:48.862
She works here.

536
00:53:52.283 --> 00:53:53.616
See that nose scar?

537
00:53:56.078 --> 00:53:58.162
Know what that means to a Cheyenne?

538
00:53:58.455 --> 00:54:00.123
One too many bucks.

539
00:54:01.125 --> 00:54:03.293
Little squaw likes the bucks, huh?

540
00:54:03.586 --> 00:54:06.462
Tell you, Zukie, you put her
on the bill too.


541
00:54:38.162 --> 00:54:40.163
I'll be looking for a horse.

542
00:54:41.165 --> 00:54:42.332
A horse?

543
00:54:43.834 --> 00:54:46.169
The horses belong to these gentlemen.

544
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:49.005
More than likely
- That is...

545
00:54:49.256 --> 00:54:51.507
...I'm sure they'd sell you one.

546
00:54:58.724 --> 00:55:00.850
Look, I've got some beer.

547
00:55:01.143 --> 00:55:02.894
Some good brewed choc.

548
00:55:05.189 --> 00:55:06.940
It's on the house.

549
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.874
You suppose these gentlemen will be...

550
00:55:25.084 --> 00:55:27.919
...available to discuss business
before long?


551
00:55:33.717 --> 00:55:35.885
Give me a bucket of that choc.

552
00:55:45.479 --> 00:55:46.896
I got him!

553
00:55:47.106 --> 00:55:49.065
I got me Josey Wales!

554
00:55:50.943 --> 00:55:52.402
Yoke.

555
00:55:52.903 --> 00:55:56.239
Five thousand gold simoleons
walked right in.


556
00:55:56.699 --> 00:55:58.700
- Right to us.
Wait a minute!


557
00:55:58.909 --> 00:56:00.201
He's in my place.

558
00:56:00.619 --> 00:56:01.786
I recognized him too.

559
00:56:03.414 --> 00:56:04.747
I'm due an even split.

560
00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:11.754
Mr. Chain
-Blue Lightning himself.

561
00:56:12.965 --> 00:56:17.093
Well, the one that everyone's
so scared of.


562
00:56:17.845 --> 00:56:19.762
Well, Mr. Lightning...

563
00:56:20.431 --> 00:56:23.766
...move a muscle, twitch a finger...

564
00:56:24.018 --> 00:56:26.602
...and I'll splatter your guts
all over the wall.


565
00:56:27.646 --> 00:56:29.522
Mr. Lightning.

566
00:56:30.524 --> 00:56:32.233
When I say move...

567
00:56:32.443 --> 00:56:34.277
...you move real slow...

568
00:56:34.486 --> 00:56:36.446
...like molasses in wintertime...

569
00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:38.448
...or I drop that hammer.

570
00:56:38.866 --> 00:56:42.326
Now, just ease your hands down.

571
00:56:43.287 --> 00:56:47.457
Take them guns out, butt first
so's you can get hold of them.


572
00:56:49.501 --> 00:56:50.626
You understand?

573
00:56:52.546 --> 00:56:53.963
Nod, damn you!

574
00:56:58.761 --> 00:56:59.802
Now...

575
00:57:00.637 --> 00:57:03.014
...ease them pistols out.

576
00:57:35.422 --> 00:57:37.048
Well, let's see...

577
00:57:38.092 --> 00:57:40.718
...you say those horses belong
to them pilgrims?


578
00:58:17.256 --> 00:58:19.590
- Howdy.
- Howdy.


579
00:58:19.842 --> 00:58:23.261
I'm getting better at sneaking up
on you like this.


580
00:58:23.762 --> 00:58:26.389
Only an Indian can do
something like this.


581
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.892
That's what I figured.

582
00:58:30.435 --> 00:58:31.561
You figured?

583
00:58:32.855 --> 00:58:35.481
Only an Indian could do
something like that.


584
00:58:50.414 --> 00:58:54.584
It's not right, this damn woman
doing something like this to me.


585
00:58:54.918 --> 00:58:56.669
I used to have power.

586
00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.172
Now old age is creeping up on me.

587
00:59:01.008 --> 00:59:05.178
I think it's more like
old habits than old age.


588
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:08.264
Who the hell is this woman?

589
00:59:09.391 --> 00:59:12.894
She was back at the trading post.
Got in some kind of trouble.


590
00:59:13.604 --> 00:59:17.106
- She's not going to Mexico with us.
- With us?


591
00:59:17.399 --> 00:59:20.651
Now wait a minute. I got you a horse.
You're on your own now.


592
00:59:20.903 --> 00:59:22.445
I've seen a lot today.

593
00:59:22.696 --> 00:59:26.324
I've seen patrols of soldiers all day.

594
00:59:26.992 --> 00:59:29.619
Everybody's looking for you.

595
00:59:31.705 --> 00:59:33.289
She's not going with us.

596
00:59:47.554 --> 00:59:49.680
She says she's Navajo...

597
00:59:49.973 --> 00:59:52.642
...but she was captured
by the Cheyenne.


598
00:59:52.935 --> 00:59:56.729
She was violated by one of the bucks
of the Arapahos.


599
00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:59.649
Their sign is the dirty nose sign.

600
00:59:59.858 --> 01:00:02.235
Cheyenne Chief, 
Black Kettle...

601
01:00:02.486 --> 01:00:06.489
...figures that she did not
resist enough.


602
01:00:14.998 --> 01:00:17.750
Hell, man, can't you get
her to shut up?


603
01:00:42.401 --> 01:00:44.485
Anyway, she says...

604
01:00:44.695 --> 01:00:47.405
...when she come to that trading post...

605
01:00:47.698 --> 01:00:50.700
...she didn't know this man,
Zukie Limmer...


606
01:00:50.909 --> 01:00:52.368
...was selling liquor.

607
01:00:52.619 --> 01:00:55.037
She also wants you to know...

608
01:00:55.247 --> 01:00:57.540
...that although he beat her a lot...

609
01:00:57.791 --> 01:01:00.376
...nothing happened between them.

610
01:01:01.878 --> 01:01:04.547
And she says you are a great warrior...

611
01:01:04.798 --> 01:01:09.635
...and that she sort of belongs to you
for what you done for her.


612
01:01:10.887 --> 01:01:14.098
Look, you tell her I don't want
nobody belonging to me.


613
01:01:16.935 --> 01:01:18.936
That meal was damn good.

614
01:01:19.229 --> 01:01:23.316
I'm going to take up tepee living
if it's like this.


615
01:01:24.651 --> 01:01:28.112
You know, she thinks I'm some kind
of a Cherokee chief.


616
01:01:29.906 --> 01:01:32.908
I wonder where she ever got that idea.

617
01:01:40.334 --> 01:01:43.586
Chief! Chief!

618
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:49.633
Chief.

619
01:01:50.093 --> 01:01:51.802
I was just wondering.

620
01:01:52.095 --> 01:01:55.431
I suppose that mangy hound's
got no place else to go either.


621
01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:02.813
He might as well ride along with us.

622
01:02:03.315 --> 01:02:05.608
Hell, everybody else is.

623
01:02:53.031 --> 01:02:54.198
Hey, you!

624
01:02:55.367 --> 01:02:56.992
Want to buy some Indian scalps?

625
01:04:04.394 --> 01:04:05.895
Nasty habit, young fellow.

626
01:04:06.104 --> 01:04:07.980
You born in a barn?

627
01:04:08.231 --> 01:04:11.066
Hold it. Real still.

628
01:04:21.912 --> 01:04:25.915
The wheat is from Kansas and the
molasses comes from Missouri.


629
01:04:26.124 --> 01:04:27.625
We'll do without molasses.

630
01:04:27.918 --> 01:04:30.294
Anything from Missouri
has a taint about it.


631
01:04:30.587 --> 01:04:33.756
Grandma, you've got to tread lightly
now we're here in Texas.


632
01:04:34.007 --> 01:04:36.509
Lots of nice elements from
Missouri coming West.


633
01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:41.013
Nothing nice comes from Missouri.
And treading lightly is not my way.


634
01:04:41.264 --> 01:04:43.933
We're from Kansas.
Jayhawkers, and proud of it.


635
01:04:44.142 --> 01:04:46.644
I know how you feel.
I'm a Hoosier, myself.


636
01:04:47.103 --> 01:04:50.272
Personally, I don't think much
of Hoosiers neither.


637
01:05:00.951 --> 01:05:02.284
Yes, friends, yes!

638
01:05:02.494 --> 01:05:05.621
This is a positive remedy
for weariness...


639
01:05:05.872 --> 01:05:09.291
...turgidity of the bowels and-

640
01:05:12.045 --> 01:05:14.547
Say, you're an Indian, aren't you?

641
01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.176
You speak any English?

642
01:05:19.636 --> 01:05:22.471
Well, sir, this is the very best thing...

643
01:05:22.681 --> 01:05:25.266
...for those who can't handle
their liquor.


644
01:05:28.645 --> 01:05:30.145
What's in it?

645
01:05:32.649 --> 01:05:36.026
I don't know. Various things.
I'm only the salesman.


646
01:05:37.862 --> 01:05:39.029
You drink it.

647
01:05:39.197 --> 01:05:40.489
What's that?

648
01:05:42.325 --> 01:05:43.826
You drink it.

649
01:05:50.709 --> 01:05:54.378
Well, what can you expect
from a nonbeliever?


650
01:05:55.297 --> 01:05:59.174
That old lady don't know the trouble
she can get into talking like that.


651
01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:02.428
Too many folks around here
with thin skin.


652
01:06:02.596 --> 01:06:05.431
Lots of Southern boys
been getting into trouble here.


653
01:06:05.682 --> 01:06:10.019
Cullen Baker and Captain Bob Lee
been fighting over in Fannin County.


654
01:06:10.312 --> 01:06:12.104
Bill Longley, Creed Taylor...

655
01:06:12.397 --> 01:06:15.357
...and all them other Taylors
down in Gonzalez.


656
01:06:15.609 --> 01:06:18.027
Killed Simp Dixon over in Cotton Gin...

657
01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.195
...weighted him down with lead.

658
01:06:21.239 --> 01:06:23.741
I got a picture postcard of it.

659
01:06:24.618 --> 01:06:26.952
Here. Have a look.

660
01:06:28.955 --> 01:06:30.205
Josey Wales.

661
01:06:34.753 --> 01:06:35.836
What say?

662
01:06:36.046 --> 01:06:38.589
Josey Wales.
They say he's coming into Texas.


663
01:06:38.882 --> 01:06:41.967
Won't come through here though.
Killed 50, 60 men.


664
01:06:42.218 --> 01:06:45.387
Regulators are all over the place
looking for him.


665
01:06:47.432 --> 01:06:48.599
How much for all this?

666
01:06:48.892 --> 01:06:50.059
Three dollars.

667
01:06:50.935 --> 01:06:52.895
Those regulators would pay plenty...

668
01:06:53.146 --> 01:06:56.231
...to the man who could
identify Josey Wales.


669
01:06:57.734 --> 01:06:59.443
Reckon so.

670
01:07:09.913 --> 01:07:10.996
How about you, sir?

671
01:07:11.247 --> 01:07:14.416
Just a few bottles left.
You won't regret it.


672
01:07:22.175 --> 01:07:23.759
Oh, my God!

673
01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:25.427
It's Josey Wales!

674
01:07:55.959 --> 01:07:58.627
You going to pull those pistols
or whistle "Dixie"?


675
01:08:46.676 --> 01:08:48.510
I told you to stay inside.

676
01:08:56.895 --> 01:08:58.061
Goddamn Indian squaw!

677
01:09:01.274 --> 01:09:02.357
Let's go!

678
01:09:39.604 --> 01:09:42.231
Welcome to Texas, Mr. Lone Watie.

679
01:09:43.817 --> 01:09:48.070
I guess we ain't going to see that
little Navajo girl again.


680
01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:50.030
I guess not.

681
01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.241
I kind of liked her.

682
01:09:52.450 --> 01:09:54.910
- But it's always like that.
- Like what?


683
01:09:56.079 --> 01:09:58.789
Whenever I get to liking someone,
they ain't around long.


684
01:09:59.249 --> 01:10:03.961
I notice when you get to disliking someone
they ain't around long neither.


685
01:10:07.257 --> 01:10:10.092
How did you know which one
was going to shoot first?


686
01:10:11.344 --> 01:10:13.762
That one in the center
had a flap holster...


687
01:10:13.972 --> 01:10:16.098
...and he was in no itching hurry.

688
01:10:16.766 --> 01:10:18.600
And the one second from the left...

689
01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:21.270
...had scared eyes.
He wasn't going to do nothing.


690
01:10:21.563 --> 01:10:23.355
But that one on the far left...

691
01:10:23.606 --> 01:10:27.150
...had crazy eyes.
Figured him to make the first move.


692
01:10:27.443 --> 01:10:28.861
And the one on the right?

693
01:10:34.075 --> 01:10:35.951
Never paid no him no mind.

694
01:10:36.202 --> 01:10:37.327
You were there.

695
01:10:43.126 --> 01:10:44.293
I could have missed.

696
01:10:44.502 --> 01:10:47.337
Yes, sir!
It was Josey Wales, all right!


697
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:50.674
Saw him heading north out of town
with a renegade Injun.


698
01:10:51.801 --> 01:10:53.302
I can identify him.

699
01:10:53.595 --> 01:10:57.639
And I'd certainly be glad
to share in any reward.


700
01:10:58.474 --> 01:11:01.018
Knew him quite well, actually.

701
01:11:03.813 --> 01:11:06.231
Well, not a hard man to track.

702
01:11:06.816 --> 01:11:09.192
Leaves dead men wherever he goes.

703
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.154
He's heading north now...

704
01:11:12.655 --> 01:11:14.698
...riding with a renegade Indian.

705
01:11:15.825 --> 01:11:18.493
He's heading north now,
but he'll turn southwest...


706
01:11:18.703 --> 01:11:20.162
...head for Mexico.

707
01:11:20.371 --> 01:11:23.248
Then we'll turn southwest
and head for Mexico.


708
01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:25.667
Tell them to head north.

709
01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.128
What are you talking about?

710
01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.885
Look at those boys over there
with tied-down guns.


711
01:11:36.679 --> 01:11:38.347
Bounty hunters.

712
01:11:38.848 --> 01:11:42.517
Come out of a war,
got no other way to make a living.


713
01:11:43.353 --> 01:11:47.356
Every last mother's son of them wants
that money you've got on Wales' head.


714
01:11:48.274 --> 01:11:51.026
You and me didn't ride
all that way for that.


715
01:11:52.695 --> 01:11:55.030
I don't want to hear Wales is dead.

716
01:11:56.574 --> 01:11:58.700
I want to see Wales dead.

717
01:12:03.039 --> 01:12:05.749
We're heading north, men. Let's ride.

718
01:12:27.397 --> 01:12:28.563
They're following us.

719
01:12:31.484 --> 01:12:35.070
Couple of horses, far off, moving fast.

720
01:12:36.781 --> 01:12:37.948
I don't hear nothing.

721
01:12:39.909 --> 01:12:42.202
Got to be an Indian to know
those things.


722
01:12:45.748 --> 01:12:49.751
Yeah. All right, let's take them
out in the sand.


723
01:14:02.366 --> 01:14:05.869
Glad you stopped me when you did.
I might have killed her.


724
01:14:06.204 --> 01:14:07.996
Oh, I noticed that.

725
01:14:14.087 --> 01:14:16.588
She got some supplies...

726
01:14:16.839 --> 01:14:18.507
...and our horses...

727
01:14:18.716 --> 01:14:20.842
...and followed us around.

728
01:14:21.219 --> 01:14:24.346
She said we was
the only kin she had.

729
01:14:24.847 --> 01:14:26.890
I bet we are, at that.

730
01:14:28.184 --> 01:14:30.894
You know, every man I ever knew...

731
01:14:31.187 --> 01:14:33.522
...who was good with a gun and lived...

732
01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:35.857
...always had an edge.

733
01:14:36.692 --> 01:14:40.195
Some of them would like to have
the sun behind their back.


734
01:14:41.697 --> 01:14:43.532
That's always a good idea.

735
01:14:45.243 --> 01:14:49.037
Yeah. Sure pays to have an edge.

736
01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:53.750
Yeah.

737
01:14:55.086 --> 01:14:57.379
All kind of edges.

738
01:14:59.215 --> 01:15:02.884
- Yeah.
- Yep.


739
01:15:36.878 --> 01:15:38.795
- Howdy.
- Howdy.


740
01:15:39.755 --> 01:15:42.174
- Is something wrong?
- Nope.


741
01:15:42.508 --> 01:15:44.593
I guess you were right.

742
01:15:45.261 --> 01:15:47.429
I ain't that old, after all.

743
01:16:20.504 --> 01:16:22.631
Not many men west of here.

744
01:16:23.132 --> 01:16:26.009
We're getting into Comanche country.

745
01:16:31.432 --> 01:16:32.807
Wagon tracks.

746
01:16:33.059 --> 01:16:35.810
But I never seen tracks like these.

747
01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.648
Never heard of Comanches traveling
in two-wheeled carts.


748
01:16:39.982 --> 01:16:41.149
Comancheros.

749
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.827
Comancheros...

750
01:16:53.037 --> 01:16:57.165
...trade liquor and guns
to Comanche for horses.


751
01:16:57.959 --> 01:16:59.668
Trade women too.

752
01:17:00.336 --> 01:17:02.003
How many of them?

753
01:17:03.339 --> 01:17:07.842
Eight, maybe nine horses,
and a couple of carts.


754
01:17:53.431 --> 01:17:56.057
Those poor pilgrims from Kansas.

755
01:17:58.436 --> 01:18:00.437
They don't look too proud now, do they?

756
01:19:49.004 --> 01:19:50.255
Wait.

757
01:20:05.771 --> 01:20:07.188
Please.

758
01:20:21.912 --> 01:20:23.204
You son of a bitch!

759
01:20:24.373 --> 01:20:26.708
Ten Bears is going to want
a fresh woman!


760
01:20:29.044 --> 01:20:31.880
Fresh, that little gal will
bring maybe 20 horses.


761
01:20:34.425 --> 01:20:38.887
Now if one of you has to,
take that old woman over there.


762
01:20:40.389 --> 01:20:43.224
She might be worth maybe one donkey.

763
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:08.708
Fix yourself.

764
01:22:24.285 --> 01:22:26.286
Move faster!

765
01:22:30.874 --> 01:22:32.333
If you fall...

766
01:22:32.585 --> 01:22:35.587
...they'll let you die. Keep walking.

767
01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.054
Come around here, bitch.
Come around here.


768
01:22:48.934 --> 01:22:51.352
Come here. Now you listen to me.

769
01:22:51.604 --> 01:22:54.355
I want you looking real good
when we get to Ten Bears.


770
01:22:54.607 --> 01:22:59.068
So I want you to jump in that wagon
and put on one of your best little dresses.


771
01:23:01.363 --> 01:23:03.197
It might boost your price.

772
01:23:04.074 --> 01:23:08.077
If you look good enough, I might outbid
old Ten Bears and take you for myself.


773
01:23:45.491 --> 01:23:47.367
If I figure this right...

774
01:23:47.743 --> 01:23:49.869
...we're facing the sun.

775
01:23:50.454 --> 01:23:52.789
This ought to give him an edge.

776
01:23:53.624 --> 01:23:55.416
Who are you talking about?

777
01:23:55.626 --> 01:23:57.126
What the hell does he want?

778
01:23:57.419 --> 01:23:58.795
Looks like a parley.

779
01:24:06.178 --> 01:24:09.597
Are you just going to sit there or
you going to see what he wants?


780
01:24:12.393 --> 01:24:14.394
Get ready, little lady.

781
01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:16.979
Hell is coming to breakfast.

782
01:24:25.781 --> 01:24:28.282
That's a mighty nice horse
you got there, mister.


783
01:24:28.492 --> 01:24:29.951
Would you sell it?

784
01:24:30.452 --> 01:24:32.995
We will give you a good price.

785
01:24:41.004 --> 01:24:42.130
Now spit!

786
01:24:47.302 --> 01:24:49.512
Just get off the horse.

787
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:56.352
Get out of the way!

788
01:25:53.786 --> 01:25:56.704
Now you'll kill us, I suppose.

789
01:25:57.706 --> 01:26:01.209
I'd have been halfway to Mexico by now
except for that crazy squaw.


790
01:26:01.418 --> 01:26:03.544
I can't understand a word she says.

791
01:26:04.546 --> 01:26:06.631
I knew that would bring you.

792
01:26:21.939 --> 01:26:23.564
Help us!

793
01:26:26.902 --> 01:26:28.152
Help us.

794
01:26:28.529 --> 01:26:30.238
Comanches.

795
01:26:30.531 --> 01:26:34.033
They won't like us killing these friends
of theirs. We better get moving.


796
01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:26.127
Looks like a family of hogs just moved
out of the seat of these britches.


797
01:27:27.671 --> 01:27:30.631
I had such beautiful clothes...

798
01:27:30.841 --> 01:27:33.342
...I was taking to our ranch.

799
01:27:34.469 --> 01:27:36.470
Whereabouts is this ranch?

800
01:27:37.014 --> 01:27:41.475
My son's ranch, he found before the war
near a town called Santo Rio.


801
01:27:41.727 --> 01:27:43.311
Creek with good water...

802
01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.813
...trees, cattle, black-tailed deer.

803
01:27:46.607 --> 01:27:49.483
It's a regular
paradise we're headed to.


804
01:27:49.902 --> 01:27:51.235
Out there?

805
01:27:52.154 --> 01:27:54.822
Your son told you this was out there?

806
01:27:55.157 --> 01:27:58.242
He told me that.
Near a place called Blood Butte.


807
01:27:58.744 --> 01:28:01.120
My son was true-blue, Mr. Wales.

808
01:28:01.330 --> 01:28:03.998
He never lied. 
It'll be there, all right.

809
01:28:06.376 --> 01:28:09.003
Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it will be.

810
01:28:09.254 --> 01:28:12.423
Cottonwoods, live oaks...

811
01:28:12.758 --> 01:28:14.884
...wild horses...

812
01:28:15.177 --> 01:28:16.844
...antelope...

813
01:28:17.137 --> 01:28:18.763
...lots of quail.

814
01:28:26.438 --> 01:28:27.521
You see them?

815
01:28:28.774 --> 01:28:29.857
What?

816
01:28:30.525 --> 01:28:32.234
The clouds over there.

817
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:36.864
Clouds are like...

818
01:28:37.074 --> 01:28:40.576
...dreams floating across
a sky-blue mind.


819
01:28:43.705 --> 01:28:45.915
I never thought of them that way.

820
01:28:49.586 --> 01:28:50.962
Indian...

821
01:28:51.421 --> 01:28:55.049
...this Mr. Wales is a cold-blooded killer.

822
01:28:55.258 --> 01:28:56.550
He's from Missouri...

823
01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:01.222
...where they're all known to be killers
of innocent men, women and children.


824
01:29:01.431 --> 01:29:04.225
Would you rather be riding with
Comancheros, Grannie?


825
01:29:06.687 --> 01:29:08.312
No, I wouldn't.

826
01:30:06.788 --> 01:30:11.959
I lost my sweet lover

827
01:30:12.169 --> 01:30:16.797
In the dirty old mines

828
01:30:17.007 --> 01:30:21.969
But he's coming back

829
01:30:22.262 --> 01:30:27.016
No matter how long I wait

830
01:30:27.267 --> 01:30:32.646
My lover is coming-

831
01:30:36.818 --> 01:30:38.152
What'll you have?

832
01:30:41.406 --> 01:30:42.698
Whiskey.

833
01:30:43.283 --> 01:30:44.784
Whiskey, he says!

834
01:30:46.661 --> 01:30:48.329
How about something else?

835
01:30:49.998 --> 01:30:52.374
Well, beer, then.

836
01:30:53.001 --> 01:30:56.670
And get those gents whatever
they're drinking. You too, ma'am.


837
01:30:58.715 --> 01:31:00.341
That's mighty decent of you.

838
01:31:00.592 --> 01:31:03.803
Been a long time since anybody
bought a drink around here.


839
01:31:04.012 --> 01:31:07.014
About as long as we had
anything to drink around here.


840
01:31:07.224 --> 01:31:09.183
Or anything else.

841
01:31:10.519 --> 01:31:14.355
Yeah, first the silver
run out of the Santo Rio.


842
01:31:14.689 --> 01:31:16.732
Then the people run out.

843
01:31:17.025 --> 01:31:18.818
Then the whiskey.

844
01:31:19.027 --> 01:31:21.237
Then the beer run out.

845
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:22.696
Well, no matter.

846
01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:26.408
It's good to see a high roller
wander through.


847
01:31:40.715 --> 01:31:42.633
I didn't mean to offend him.

848
01:31:42.884 --> 01:31:46.220
I guess some fellows just don't like
to be called high rollers.


849
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:50.891
You know, I knew a fellow once,
he didn't like to be called highhanded.


850
01:31:53.895 --> 01:31:55.563
We'll have whiskey all around.

851
01:31:55.856 --> 01:31:57.606
Comanchero brand.

852
01:32:04.489 --> 01:32:07.241
Angels of Mercy come to Santo Rio!

853
01:32:07.450 --> 01:32:09.368
This ain't Santo Rio.

854
01:32:09.578 --> 01:32:12.288
My son, Tom Turner,
said it was a thriving place.


855
01:32:12.581 --> 01:32:14.123
It was.

856
01:32:14.416 --> 01:32:17.459
But when the silver run out,
the thriving run out.


857
01:32:17.752 --> 01:32:18.878
That's right.

858
01:32:19.087 --> 01:32:21.589
I do declare.

859
01:32:21.882 --> 01:32:23.757
Might you be the mother
of Tom Turner...


860
01:32:24.009 --> 01:32:27.094
...whose Crooked River Ranch
is over by Blood Butte?


861
01:32:27.304 --> 01:32:30.764
- That I might, miss.
- Well!


862
01:32:30.974 --> 01:32:33.392
I am Rose.

863
01:32:33.602 --> 01:32:35.269
Rose of Santo Rio.

864
01:32:35.478 --> 01:32:37.980
I reckon he wrote you all about me.

865
01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.816
I don't recollect that.

866
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:43.611
After his Lucy passed on...

867
01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:45.779
...he didn't show much
interest in women.


868
01:32:46.823 --> 01:32:51.702
My sonny-boy kept his nose to the
grindstone, providing a future for me...


869
01:32:51.953 --> 01:32:53.120
...and his daughter there.

870
01:32:56.833 --> 01:33:00.794
I do seem to recall him
telling me something about...


871
01:33:01.004 --> 01:33:03.964
...a daughter who was a little odd.

872
01:33:04.174 --> 01:33:08.719
He was killed in the Border War
by Missouri ruffians.


873
01:33:08.970 --> 01:33:12.306
He died a proud member of
Senator Jim Lane's Redlegs...


874
01:33:14.351 --> 01:33:15.809
...fighting for the just cause!

875
01:33:16.061 --> 01:33:18.229
I am sorry to hear that.

876
01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.482
I mean, he was of the finest sort.

877
01:33:21.733 --> 01:33:24.235
SeĆ±ora, please sit down.

878
01:33:24.486 --> 01:33:27.154
You must be very, very tired.

879
01:33:28.949 --> 01:33:32.660
I am deeply sorrowed to hear this.

880
01:33:32.953 --> 01:33:34.495
In past years...

881
01:33:34.704 --> 01:33:38.165
...my friend and I were of service
to your Tom Turner.


882
01:33:38.375 --> 01:33:40.668
And now we are at your service.

883
01:33:42.087 --> 01:33:45.714
Why, I appreciate your concern.

884
01:33:46.007 --> 01:33:49.343
I am glad to find manners at last,
here in the wilderness.


885
01:33:49.844 --> 01:33:53.889
We have endured hardship of the
worst sort on the way out here.


886
01:33:55.058 --> 01:33:58.560
Grandpa Samuel and Uncle Enoch...

887
01:33:58.853 --> 01:34:01.522
...fell prey to Comancheros.

888
01:34:01.731 --> 01:34:05.567
Let's drink to the silver running out.
Gave us some peace and quiet here!


889
01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:07.569
Bad luck, the silver running out.

890
01:34:09.114 --> 01:34:11.031
I wouldn't have any other kind!

891
01:34:19.249 --> 01:34:20.291
What'll you have?

892
01:34:21.918 --> 01:34:24.003
I'm looking for Josey Wales.

893
01:34:27.257 --> 01:34:28.424
That'll be me.

894
01:34:32.304 --> 01:34:34.013
You're wanted, Wales.

895
01:34:34.389 --> 01:34:36.390
Reckon I'm right popular.

896
01:34:38.727 --> 01:34:40.144
You a bounty hunter?

897
01:34:40.562 --> 01:34:43.397
A man's got to do something
for a living these days.


898
01:34:44.441 --> 01:34:46.942
Dying ain't much of a living, boy.

899
01:34:50.905 --> 01:34:53.032
You know, this isn't necessary.

900
01:34:53.908 --> 01:34:55.909
You can just ride on.

901
01:35:13.595 --> 01:35:15.346
Whew.

902
01:35:33.865 --> 01:35:35.157
I had to come back.

903
01:35:36.326 --> 01:35:37.576
I know.

904
01:36:19.619 --> 01:36:22.121
- Comanche?
- Comanches, all right.


905
01:36:22.872 --> 01:36:24.164
Any more of them?

906
01:36:24.374 --> 01:36:26.500
I think that's all there is...

907
01:36:26.835 --> 01:36:29.545
...but they have horses
packing antelope...


908
01:36:29.838 --> 01:36:32.214
...so I figure they're not
a raiding party.


909
01:36:32.715 --> 01:36:35.008
But you never can tell
these Comanches.


910
01:36:36.177 --> 01:36:37.678
You stay with the cart.

911
01:36:57.073 --> 01:36:59.199
Just looking us over, I guess.

912
01:36:59.701 --> 01:37:01.577
They're packing heavy.

913
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:02.953
They may return.

914
01:37:03.204 --> 01:37:04.872
All right, let's move out.

915
01:37:12.422 --> 01:37:15.048
If they ride with Ten Bears...

916
01:37:15.258 --> 01:37:16.884
...they will come back.

917
01:37:17.802 --> 01:37:20.929
Ten Bears is the greatest
Comanche war chief.


918
01:37:21.306 --> 01:37:22.556
But he's angry.

919
01:37:22.765 --> 01:37:26.185
Each year, he has met with
one of your bluecoat generals.


920
01:37:26.352 --> 01:37:27.603
Ain't one of my generals.

921
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:31.273
And each year he is pushed
further across the plains.


922
01:37:31.566 --> 01:37:34.485
General Sherman has come
with more promises.


923
01:37:34.736 --> 01:37:37.237
But Ten Bears will move no more.

924
01:38:31.334 --> 01:38:33.835
It's so beautiful.

925
01:38:41.970 --> 01:38:45.472
All right, we can get to work
dusting first.


926
01:38:46.015 --> 01:38:50.769
Got a nice Dutch oven
in the fireplace here.


927
01:38:50.979 --> 01:38:54.982
Mr. Wales, you men chop some wood.

928
01:38:55.275 --> 01:38:58.485
Now, get everything done.

929
01:38:58.861 --> 01:39:01.154
Mr. Wales!

930
01:39:01.573 --> 01:39:04.283
Did you come all this way to gawk?

931
01:39:04.909 --> 01:39:07.327
If you don't work,
you don't eat around here.


932
01:39:07.579 --> 01:39:09.788
Didn't figure you for a loafer.

933
01:39:34.939 --> 01:39:37.608
You know, she told me...

934
01:39:37.859 --> 01:39:42.195
...it's the first time she ever had
a place of her own.


935
01:39:43.448 --> 01:39:45.907
Grandma says it's our home.

936
01:39:46.367 --> 01:39:48.577
It is all of ours.

937
01:39:49.412 --> 01:39:52.706
I'm glad there will be a man
around to take care of things.


938
01:39:53.458 --> 01:39:56.251
I'll be dropping back from time to time...

939
01:39:57.045 --> 01:39:59.212
...probably just to hole up.

940
01:39:59.881 --> 01:40:02.257
Why don't you stay with us?

941
01:40:02.717 --> 01:40:04.593
Be our partner.

942
01:40:06.054 --> 01:40:07.387
They won't miss you.

943
01:40:07.597 --> 01:40:09.848
Maybe they'll forget you.

944
01:40:11.934 --> 01:40:14.394
You know there ain't no forgetting.

945
01:41:04.946 --> 01:41:06.113
Pa!

946
01:41:36.936 --> 01:41:38.645
Hey there, Josey!

947
01:41:43.818 --> 01:41:45.986
We're going to Santo Rio!

948
01:41:55.455 --> 01:42:00.459
In the sweet by and by

949
01:42:00.668 --> 01:42:05.839
We shall meet in the beautiful shore

950
01:42:06.007 --> 01:42:11.178
In the sweet by and by

951
01:42:11.345 --> 01:42:16.767
We will meet on that beautiful shore

952
01:42:17.518 --> 01:42:19.519
In the sweet by and by

953
01:42:24.525 --> 01:42:29.988
We will meet on that beautiful shore.

954
01:42:30.907 --> 01:42:35.702
Lord, thanks a lot for bringing us
to this place.


955
01:42:36.704 --> 01:42:38.205
Pa and Daniel died...

956
01:42:38.498 --> 01:42:42.083
...at the hands of that low-down,
murdering trash out of hell...


957
01:42:42.543 --> 01:42:44.127
...that done them in.

958
01:42:44.712 --> 01:42:48.131
But they put up a good fight
and died the best they could.


959
01:42:48.758 --> 01:42:50.717
And thanks a lot for Josey Wales...

960
01:42:51.511 --> 01:42:54.805
...who you changed from
a murdering bushwhacker...


961
01:42:55.056 --> 01:42:56.807
...on the side of Satan...

962
01:42:57.058 --> 01:42:58.600
...to a better man...

963
01:42:58.893 --> 01:43:01.770
...in time to deliver us
from the Philistines.


964
01:43:02.396 --> 01:43:06.399
And thank you, Lord,
for getting us together in Texas.


965
01:43:14.116 --> 01:43:15.617
Are you all right?

966
01:43:15.827 --> 01:43:19.329
Ten Bears, he got Travis and Chato.

967
01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:22.082
He'll be riding here in the morning.

968
01:43:40.643 --> 01:43:43.687
If I was looking for a place
to hole up, I'd pick this one.


969
01:43:43.938 --> 01:43:46.439
Walls and ceiling, two feet thick.

970
01:43:46.691 --> 01:43:48.817
All made out of mud, nothing to burn.

971
01:43:50.069 --> 01:43:53.363
Two doors, front and back,
right in sight of one another.


972
01:43:53.614 --> 01:43:57.659
These here crosses are to fire rifles
through. Up and down, side to side.


973
01:43:57.952 --> 01:43:59.953
Tom Turner knew what he was doing.

974
01:44:00.121 --> 01:44:02.455
You bet he did.
I'll be shooting out of that door.


975
01:44:02.623 --> 01:44:04.875
I'd rather have you sit right there...

976
01:44:05.126 --> 01:44:07.377
...and do the loading.
Can you do that?


977
01:44:07.628 --> 01:44:09.004
I can.

978
01:44:10.298 --> 01:44:11.506
Moonlight...

979
01:44:12.133 --> 01:44:16.177
...I want you to go to this door.
You fire through here, all right?


980
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:19.139
Laura Lee, right through this window.
Can you shoot?


981
01:44:19.348 --> 01:44:20.473
I'll try.

982
01:44:20.725 --> 01:44:23.977
Lone, you take this window
right over here, and the door.


983
01:44:24.228 --> 01:44:25.729
Where there's the most firing.

984
01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:30.150
You'll have to keep an eye on
that hallway there because...


985
01:44:31.861 --> 01:44:35.989
...the only blind spot is the ceiling.
They'll get around to it eventually.


986
01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:38.825
They can't shoot through it,
but they might...


987
01:44:39.035 --> 01:44:42.203
...dig a hole in it and drop down,
maybe in the back bedroom.


988
01:44:43.873 --> 01:44:45.248
Now remember...

989
01:44:45.917 --> 01:44:49.044
...when things look bad,
and it looks like you won't make it...


990
01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:50.837
...then you got to get mean.

991
01:44:51.047 --> 01:44:53.340
I mean plumb, maddog mean!

992
01:44:53.841 --> 01:44:57.636
Because if you lose your head and give up,
then you neither live nor win.


993
01:44:58.179 --> 01:44:59.679
That's just the way it is.

994
01:45:00.056 --> 01:45:03.850
Use pistols at short range.
More fire power and less reloading.


995
01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:06.853
Keep this fire going.
Keep an iron on it red-hot.


996
01:45:07.146 --> 01:45:09.147
Anybody gets hit, slap iron to it.

997
01:45:09.357 --> 01:45:11.733
That's the fastest way
to stop the blood.


998
01:45:15.279 --> 01:45:17.280
What's all that paint about?

999
01:45:17.531 --> 01:45:19.157
It's my death face.

1000
01:45:20.034 --> 01:45:24.079
You know, we're sure going to show them
redskins something tomorrow!


1001
01:45:24.372 --> 01:45:25.789
No offense meant.

1002
01:45:27.041 --> 01:45:28.667
None taken.

1003
01:45:39.053 --> 01:45:40.178
Where's he going?

1004
01:45:40.554 --> 01:45:44.265
He knows he can do the best for us
on the back of a horse.


1005
01:45:44.558 --> 01:45:46.059
He's a guerrilla fighter.

1006
01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:49.562
He figures he can carry the fight
to the enemy.


1007
01:45:49.772 --> 01:45:53.566
He's going down into the valley
to kill Ten Bears...


1008
01:45:53.901 --> 01:45:56.319
...and as many of
the men as he can.

1009
01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:58.738
How will he do
that and come back here?

1010
01:46:00.241 --> 01:46:01.574
He won't come back.

1011
01:46:07.456 --> 01:46:09.082
Josey!

1012
01:48:35.646 --> 01:48:36.729
You'll be Ten Bears?

1013
01:48:37.481 --> 01:48:39.232
I am Ten Bears.

1014
01:48:43.904 --> 01:48:45.738
I'm Josey Wales.

1015
01:48:47.908 --> 01:48:49.576
I have heard.

1016
01:48:50.661 --> 01:48:52.412
You're the Gray Rider.

1017
01:48:52.663 --> 01:48:57.250
You would not make peace with
the Bluecoats. You may go in peace.


1018
01:48:58.961 --> 01:49:00.003
I reckon not.

1019
01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:09.262
- Got nowhere to go.
- Then you will die.


1020
01:49:11.515 --> 01:49:13.433
I came here to die with you.

1021
01:49:15.769 --> 01:49:17.270
Or live with you.

1022
01:49:18.647 --> 01:49:21.774
Dying's not hard for you and me.
It's living that's hard...


1023
01:49:21.984 --> 01:49:24.986
...when all you ever cared about
has been butchered or raped.


1024
01:49:27.948 --> 01:49:30.909
Governments don't live together.
People live together.


1025
01:49:31.410 --> 01:49:36.122
Governments don't give you a fair word
or a fair fight. I've come here to...


1026
01:49:36.415 --> 01:49:39.125
...give you either one.
Or get either one from you.


1027
01:49:42.546 --> 01:49:46.132
I came here like this so you'll know
my word of death is true.


1028
01:49:46.508 --> 01:49:48.927
And that my word
of life is then true.

1029
01:49:51.972 --> 01:49:56.726
The bear lives here, the wolf,
the antelope, the Comanche.


1030
01:49:57.186 --> 01:49:58.978
And so will we.

1031
01:50:00.022 --> 01:50:03.483
We'll only hunt what we need to live on,
same as the Comanche does.


1032
01:50:04.485 --> 01:50:07.570
And every spring when
the Comanche moves north...


1033
01:50:07.821 --> 01:50:09.364
...he can rest here in peace...

1034
01:50:09.657 --> 01:50:13.159
...butcher some of our cattle
and jerk beef for the journey.


1035
01:50:13.827 --> 01:50:17.580
The sign of the Comanche,
that will be on our lodge.


1036
01:50:17.831 --> 01:50:18.998
That's my word of life.

1037
01:50:19.667 --> 01:50:21.334
And your word of death?

1038
01:50:22.169 --> 01:50:25.380
It's here in my pistols
and there in your rifles.


1039
01:50:25.673 --> 01:50:27.006
I'm here for either one.

1040
01:50:27.216 --> 01:50:31.678
These things you say we will have,
we already have.


1041
01:50:32.179 --> 01:50:35.974
That's true.
I ain't promising you nothing extra.


1042
01:50:36.517 --> 01:50:39.686
I'm just giving you life,
and you're giving me life.


1043
01:50:39.895 --> 01:50:43.690
And I'm saying men can live together
without butchering one another.


1044
01:50:46.193 --> 01:50:50.697
It's sad that governments are chiefed
by the double-tongues.


1045
01:50:50.906 --> 01:50:55.034
There is iron in your words of death
for all Comanches to see.


1046
01:50:55.244 --> 01:50:58.246
And so there is iron
in your words of life.


1047
01:50:58.872 --> 01:51:02.417
No signed paper can hold the iron.

1048
01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:04.711
It must come from men.

1049
01:51:05.504 --> 01:51:09.716
The words of Ten Bears carry
the same iron of life and death.


1050
01:51:10.217 --> 01:51:14.721
It is good that warriors such as we
meet in the struggle of life...


1051
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:16.556
...or death.

1052
01:51:19.226 --> 01:51:21.144
It shall be life.

1053
01:51:46.754 --> 01:51:47.920
So will it be.

1054
01:51:49.089 --> 01:51:50.757
I reckon so.

1055
01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.595
I'll be damned! Look at this!

1056
01:52:06.607 --> 01:52:08.858
Come. Sit down.

1057
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:11.778
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!

1058
01:52:12.613 --> 01:52:15.198
I never thought I'd see you again,
Grandma.


1059
01:52:15.366 --> 01:52:18.493
Chato, Chato. Sit down.

1060
01:52:18.786 --> 01:52:20.787
I never been so
glad to see an Indian.

1061
01:53:25.686 --> 01:53:28.354
I've got something to show you,
Mr. Wales.


1062
01:53:30.357 --> 01:53:32.567
I made this chain for you.

1063
01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:34.861
I braided it from my hair.

1064
01:53:37.698 --> 01:53:40.158
That's real nice. It really is.

1065
01:53:40.367 --> 01:53:42.201
It's a watch chain.

1066
01:53:43.078 --> 01:53:47.707
Yeah. Well, it's a nice one.
It will come in handy. I thank you for it.


1067
01:53:50.377 --> 01:53:52.712
You do have a watch, don't you?

1068
01:53:56.383 --> 01:53:58.801
Well, I've been meaning to get one, yeah.

1069
01:54:00.762 --> 01:54:02.555
Could we...

1070
01:54:02.764 --> 01:54:04.557
...play a song for you?

1071
01:54:05.934 --> 01:54:10.396
I'm afraid I don't really know
too many songs.


1072
01:54:20.073 --> 01:54:23.201
Could we play something you like?
Come on.


1073
01:54:23.744 --> 01:54:27.079
Only song I can think of is
"Rose of Alabama."


1074
01:54:27.748 --> 01:54:30.583
We remember that old piece.
Rosie, come here.


1075
01:54:33.295 --> 01:54:38.758
Away from Mississippi's veil
With my old half-ear for a sail


1076
01:54:39.134 --> 01:54:41.802
I crossed upon a cotton bale

1077
01:54:42.095 --> 01:54:44.847
To the rose of Alabama

1078
01:54:46.642 --> 01:54:49.227
- Do you dance?
- No.


1079
01:54:49.436 --> 01:54:50.853
Me neither.

1080
01:54:51.647 --> 01:54:56.984
A sweet tobacco posy
Is the rose of Alabama


1081
01:54:57.277 --> 01:55:02.657
A sweet tobacco posy
Is the rose of Alabama


1082
01:55:02.866 --> 01:55:03.950
Help us out now.

1083
01:55:04.159 --> 01:55:09.121
Oh, brown rosie
The rose of Alabama


1084
01:55:12.459 --> 01:55:14.961
The rose of Alabama

1085
01:56:00.215 --> 01:56:03.384
I could see him through this window
when he shot my partner.


1086
01:56:03.885 --> 01:56:06.929
He was traveling with an
old Injun and a squaw...


1087
01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:09.432
...and some old lady
and a scrawny girl.


1088
01:56:10.225 --> 01:56:14.020
Had to be him. He had this scar
right on his face, right here.


1089
01:56:14.730 --> 01:56:17.023
I wasn't about to face him down alone.

1090
01:56:18.567 --> 01:56:20.526
Mm-hm.

1091
01:56:21.903 --> 01:56:24.697
You men get them horses out of sight.

1092
01:56:27.576 --> 01:56:31.120
If Josey Wales comes back here,
we'll buy him a drink.


1093
01:57:14.748 --> 01:57:16.666
Kansas was all...

1094
01:57:17.292 --> 01:57:20.670
...golden and smelled like sunshine.

1095
01:57:22.422 --> 01:57:23.589
Yeah.

1096
01:57:24.591 --> 01:57:27.927
I always heard there were three
kinds of suns in Kansas.


1097
01:57:28.595 --> 01:57:30.096
Sunshine...

1098
01:57:30.764 --> 01:57:32.181
...sunflowers...

1099
01:57:32.432 --> 01:57:34.266
...and sons of bitches.

1100
01:57:38.105 --> 01:57:41.440
Well, at least we're known
for something.


1101
01:57:45.445 --> 01:57:47.780
I heard a joke about Missouri once.

1102
01:57:48.281 --> 01:57:51.283
Something about how people
from Missouri...


1103
01:57:51.535 --> 01:57:54.453
...are always saying, "Show me."

1104
01:57:55.455 --> 01:57:57.790
- Do you know it?
- No.


1105
01:57:57.999 --> 01:57:59.417
I think it was:

1106
01:58:03.046 --> 01:58:05.548
What does a man from Missouri say...

1107
01:58:05.799 --> 01:58:09.969
...if someone asks him to see a
Missouri mule?


1108
01:58:10.971 --> 01:58:13.639
- And?
- He says, "Show me."


1109
01:58:16.143 --> 01:58:17.476
Get it?

1110
01:58:17.811 --> 01:58:20.813
They teach dumb jokes
to pretty girls in Kansas.


1111
01:58:23.525 --> 01:58:25.317
They teach other things.

1112
01:58:33.326 --> 01:58:34.827
Show me.

1113
01:59:12.199 --> 01:59:13.699
Pa!

1114
01:59:49.402 --> 01:59:51.445
You're up kind of early, aren't you?

1115
01:59:54.449 --> 01:59:56.450
It's been nice riding with you.

1116
01:59:57.536 --> 01:59:58.577
Same here.

1117
01:59:59.579 --> 02:00:03.833
When you get to town, get some nice
dresses for the ladies, you hear?


1118
02:00:04.668 --> 02:00:05.835
I will.

1119
02:00:06.419 --> 02:00:10.464
Get something specially nice for Laura
Lee for when I come back in the spring.


1120
02:00:16.096 --> 02:00:17.471
Yeah.

1121
02:00:17.931 --> 02:00:20.057
Or the following spring.

1122
02:00:22.644 --> 02:00:23.769
Yeah.

1123
02:00:25.939 --> 02:00:28.691
Sometimes trouble just follows a man.

1124
02:00:29.693 --> 02:00:32.278
Hell, I've been here way
too long as it-


1125
02:00:38.994 --> 02:00:40.786
I reckon so.

1126
02:01:09.649 --> 02:01:11.734
Josey Wales!

1127
02:02:32.065 --> 02:02:34.900
You're all alone now, Wales.

1128
02:02:36.569 --> 02:02:38.320
Not quite alone.

1129
02:03:18.987 --> 02:03:22.740
Now we're really going to show
these palefaces something!


1130
02:03:22.949 --> 02:03:24.033
No offense.

1131
02:03:24.284 --> 02:03:25.617
None taken.

1132
02:03:25.827 --> 02:03:29.997
These freebooters are
a slander to Kansas...


1133
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:33.167
...attacking innocent women like this.

1134
02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:03.603
Josey!

1135
02:09:04.290 --> 02:09:08.585
The bullets were flying
and people running every which way.


1136
02:09:08.795 --> 02:09:12.130
Church bells were ringing.
Me and Miss Rose were ducking for cover.


1137
02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:15.092
Because one didn't know where
the shots were coming-


1138
02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:24.309
Mr. Wilson!

1139
02:09:24.852 --> 02:09:26.019
Good morning.

1140
02:09:26.312 --> 02:09:28.897
Hello, Mr. Wilson.

1141
02:09:29.315 --> 02:09:31.316
We were just telling a little story...

1142
02:09:31.609 --> 02:09:35.320
...about an outlaw passed through
this way a while back.


1143
02:09:35.655 --> 02:09:37.739
I don't suppose you'd know
about him but-


1144
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:42.244
These two fellows down here
is Texas Rangers.


1145
02:09:42.662 --> 02:09:46.498
Been on his trail, along with this
other fellow over here.


1146
02:09:46.749 --> 02:09:48.750
What did you say your name was,
friend?


1147
02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:58.635
- My name is Fletcher.
- That's right, Mr. Fletcher.


1148
02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:01.763
Anyway, they've been chasing
this outlaw...


1149
02:10:02.014 --> 02:10:06.184
...and it just so happens old Ten Spot
here knows all about it.


1150
02:10:06.436 --> 02:10:07.853
Yes, sir.

1151
02:10:08.146 --> 02:10:12.023
It was down in Monterey, Mexico,
a little while back.


1152
02:10:12.442 --> 02:10:14.192
Anyway, this outlaw fellow...

1153
02:10:14.569 --> 02:10:17.154
...he went up against five
pistoleros.


1154
02:10:17.530 --> 02:10:20.532
He got three of them
before they cut him down.


1155
02:10:21.159 --> 02:10:22.451
Is that right, Miss Rose?

1156
02:10:22.702 --> 02:10:25.579
That's right. His name was...

1157
02:10:26.581 --> 02:10:27.914
...Josey Wales.

1158
02:10:28.207 --> 02:10:31.209
Yeah, that's it. Josey Wales.

1159
02:10:33.713 --> 02:10:36.548
If that's what happened,
then Josey Wales must be dead.


1160
02:10:38.050 --> 02:10:39.551
He is dead.

1161
02:10:40.052 --> 02:10:42.971
He sure is dead.

1162
02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:47.392
Dead, all right.

1163
02:10:52.732 --> 02:10:54.399
Will you sign this affidavit?

1164
02:10:55.067 --> 02:10:57.777
Sign? I sure will.

1165
02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:15.712
That's it.

1166
02:11:23.763 --> 02:11:25.639
Nice seeing you, Mr. Wilson.

1167
02:11:31.646 --> 02:11:34.356
Must be 5000 lawmen
in Texas right now.


1168
02:11:34.607 --> 02:11:35.649
Can't get them all.

1169
02:11:35.942 --> 02:11:37.984
I guess that's the truth.

1170
02:11:38.945 --> 02:11:41.321
You fellows get back up this way,
stop in.


1171
02:11:41.614 --> 02:11:44.282
I reckon we won't be coming
back this way.


1172
02:11:49.622 --> 02:11:52.624
I don't believe that story
about Josey Wales.


1173
02:11:52.875 --> 02:11:54.167
You don't?

1174
02:11:54.627 --> 02:11:56.461
No, sir, I don't.

1175
02:11:57.171 --> 02:12:01.299
I don't believe no five pistoleros
could do in Josey Wales.


1176
02:12:02.301 --> 02:12:04.052
Maybe it was six.

1177
02:12:04.303 --> 02:12:05.804
Could have even been 10.

1178
02:12:07.473 --> 02:12:08.890
I think he's still alive.

1179
02:12:09.141 --> 02:12:11.643
Alive? No sir.

1180
02:12:18.985 --> 02:12:22.779
I think I'll go down to Mexico
to try to find him.


1181
02:12:30.913 --> 02:12:31.997
And then?

1182
02:12:41.007 --> 02:12:43.174
He's got the first move.

1183
02:12:43.884 --> 02:12:45.343
I owe him that.

1184
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:49.681
I'll try to tell
him the war is over.

1185
02:13:06.365 --> 02:13:07.699
What do you say, Mr. Wilson?

1186
02:13:15.416 --> 02:13:17.042
I reckon so.

1187
02:13:24.133 --> 02:13:27.052
I guess we all died a little
in that damn war.
