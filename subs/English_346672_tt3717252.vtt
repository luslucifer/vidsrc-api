00:00:58.178 --> 00:01:00.763
<i>I was an elite soldier
in the vampire army.</i>


2
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.557
<i>A Death Dealer.</i>

3
00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:05.768
<i>And I was good at it.</i>

4
00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:09.814
<i>But I was betrayed.</i>

5
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:13.776
<i>Viktor, our leader
and the most powerful vampire...</i>


6
00:01:13.943 --> 00:01:16.821
<i>was not the savior
he had led me to believe.</i>


7
00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:21.201
<i>Suddenly, allies turned enemies.</i>

8
00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:25.580
<i>The vampire Elders I had once protected
wanted me dead.</i>


9
00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:30.084
<i>Then I found Michael Corvin.</i>

10
00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:34.255
<i>Neither vampire nor Lycan,
Michael became a hybrid.</i>


11
00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:38.760
<i>We retaliated, killed the Elders.</i>

12
00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:43.723
<i>But then everything changed.</i>

13
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.812
<i>I was captured, not knowing that I was
carrying Michael's child.</i>


14
00:01:48.978 --> 00:01:51.940
<i>Eve, our daughter,
the first pure-blood hybrid...</i>


15
00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:54.359
<i>whose blood could end the war...</i>

16
00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:57.946
<i>became highly sought after
by both vampires and Lycans alike.</i>


17
00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:07.038
<i>My only choice was to hide her
from the world and from myself...</i>


18
00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:08.873
<i>so not even I
could lead them to her.</i>

19
00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.993
<i>I have lived beyond my time.</i>

20
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.955
<i>Another new moon
in 1000 years of new moons...</i>


21
00:02:50.707 --> 00:02:53.293
<i>and I do not care to see it.</i>

22
00:02:57.005 --> 00:02:58.173
<i>I have nothing.</i>

23
00:02:58.673 --> 00:02:59.883
<i>My coven...</i>

24
00:03:01.217 --> 00:03:02.927
<i>my daughter...</i>

25
00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.013
<i>- my love, all gone.</i>
- Cut her off!


26
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.183
<i>And soon, perhaps...</i>

27
00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.518
<i>my very existence.</i>

28
00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:12.270
- Selene's coming!
<i>- I am hunted...</i>


29
00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:14.647
<i>by vampires and Lycans.</i>

30
00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:19.486
<i>Now I am an outcast, a pariah.</i>

31
00:03:28.912 --> 00:03:32.957
- Put her down!
- Remember, he wants her alive.


32
00:03:33.124 --> 00:03:34.167
Fire!

33
00:03:38.213 --> 00:03:39.756
Come on, now. Fire!

34
00:04:36.354 --> 00:04:39.107
You are an extremely difficult person
to keep track of.


35
00:04:39.274 --> 00:04:40.650
I don't need you.

36
00:04:42.402 --> 00:04:43.444
But thank you.

37
00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:44.737
Any word with Michael?

38
00:04:44.904 --> 00:04:47.031
- Stop tracking me!
- I'm not tracking you.


39
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:49.450
I'm looking for Eve.

40
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.079
Well, I'm the very last person
who could help you find my daughter.


41
00:04:53.246 --> 00:04:56.332
Selene, listen to me.
The Lycans are moving again.


42
00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:57.959
No, this is different.

43
00:04:58.126 --> 00:05:00.503
They're organized.
They have a new leader.


44
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.670
- His name is Marius.
- I'm finished with this war.


45
00:05:02.714 --> 00:05:04.034
Well, it's not finished with you.

46
00:05:04.174 --> 00:05:05.334
They could have killed you...

47
00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:07.844
but clearly their mission
was to capture you.


48
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:10.847
Your daughter's blood, it's a prize.

49
00:05:11.014 --> 00:05:12.932
And if they find
her, if they use it...

50
00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.479
- Marius's power will be limitless.
- Well, then I hope she remains lost.


51
00:05:22.734 --> 00:05:24.569
I need you to deliver a message.

52
00:05:24.736 --> 00:05:26.821
Grunt if you understand.

53
00:05:26.988 --> 00:05:28.406
Tell your Marius...

54
00:05:28.573 --> 00:05:30.551
if he thinks he can extract information
from me...


55
00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:32.285
to locate my daughter, he can't.

56
00:05:32.452 --> 00:05:34.621
I don't know where she is,
and I don't want to know.


57
00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:36.372
Marius will find you.

58
00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:41.252
Do you understand your message?

59
00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:53.097
What is it?

60
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.475
Have you seen this before?

61
00:05:55.642 --> 00:05:56.935
No...

62
00:05:57.101 --> 00:05:58.603
but we need to get it out.

63
00:06:02.482 --> 00:06:04.108
Let's go.

64
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:24.379
<i>Bravo one, over. 
Car approaching.</i>

65
00:06:24.546 --> 00:06:26.881
<i>- Access cleared.
- Close the gates.</i>


66
00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:31.845
<i>Commencing perimeter sweep.</i>

67
00:06:47.152 --> 00:06:49.612
Privilege to welcome you home at last, sir.

68
00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:51.865
Semira awaits you
in her private chambers.


69
00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:53.783
Semira?

70
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.410
Where is Cassius?

71
00:06:55.577 --> 00:06:57.388
The entire council will greet you,
of course, sir...


72
00:06:57.412 --> 00:07:00.707
but Semira requests
just a few moments.


73
00:07:00.874 --> 00:07:02.417
And your name is?

74
00:07:02.584 --> 00:07:04.002
Varga, sir.

75
00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:06.212
I shall try to remember it.

76
00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:29.694
And act accordingly
because of this tragic...


77
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:31.488
Leave us.

78
00:07:34.574 --> 00:07:38.161
Darling Thomas. 
It has been...

79
00:07:38.328 --> 00:07:40.705
- how long?
- Decades.


80
00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:42.540
Congratulations.

81
00:07:42.707 --> 00:07:44.185
I gather you have a seat
on the council.


82
00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:45.668
I could not be more proud.

83
00:07:46.544 --> 00:07:50.298
It's a shame that your return is not under
more festive circumstances.


84
00:07:50.465 --> 00:07:53.551
It is said that the Western Coven
was utterly destroyed.


85
00:07:53.718 --> 00:07:54.844
Yes, it was.

86
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:56.971
It's a blessing
you escaped with your life.


87
00:07:58.264 --> 00:07:59.808
Well, many did not.

88
00:07:59.974 --> 00:08:02.310
There has been too much death
among our people.


89
00:08:02.477 --> 00:08:05.480
These urns are all that remain
of our Budapest Coven.


90
00:08:05.647 --> 00:08:07.607
Well, you have my condolences.

91
00:08:07.774 --> 00:08:10.944
We are losing the war, Thomas.

92
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.405
If we stay as we are, our species
will be extinct within five years.


93
00:08:14.572 --> 00:08:16.157
Does Cassius share your view?

94
00:08:16.324 --> 00:08:20.120
The Lycans have regrouped, replenished,
and are resolved to exterminate us.


95
00:08:20.286 --> 00:08:23.206
Oh, surely, you're safe here.
The Eastern Coven is a fortress.


96
00:08:23.373 --> 00:08:25.500
We are no longer
the coven you remember.


97
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:27.877
We have fewer Death Dealers
than ever before.


98
00:08:28.044 --> 00:08:30.296
You seem to be surrounded
by new cadets.


99
00:08:30.463 --> 00:08:33.675
Raw recruits, neither combat-ready
nor numerous enough...


100
00:08:33.883 --> 00:08:35.760
to repel a large-scale Lycan attack.

101
00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:39.806
There has never been
a large-scale Lycan attack.


102
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.517
At least not a coordinated one.

103
00:08:42.684 --> 00:08:45.353
There has never been a Marius.

104
00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:49.732
Pains me to admit it,
but for the first time in my life...


105
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.402
I genuinely fear for our future.

106
00:08:53.153 --> 00:08:55.405
So, what is your plan?

107
00:08:57.073 --> 00:08:59.742
Semira, you always have a plan.

108
00:08:59.909 --> 00:09:03.496
This little mise-en-scene
you're performing has a purpose.


109
00:09:03.663 --> 00:09:04.956
I am not a mind reader.

110
00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:06.958
Kindly do an old vampire the courtesy...

111
00:09:07.125 --> 00:09:10.503
of telling him why
he's been invited here.


112
00:09:14.424 --> 00:09:16.217
Selene.

113
00:09:16.384 --> 00:09:17.886
Come on. We need to keep moving.

114
00:09:18.052 --> 00:09:20.388
There are safe houses
far closer than this.


115
00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:22.432
I told you, they destroyed them.

116
00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:24.350
It's different now. Come on.

117
00:09:26.978 --> 00:09:28.688
But you signed her death warrant.

118
00:09:28.855 --> 00:09:30.940
Of course. I despise her.

119
00:09:31.107 --> 00:09:32.817
She killed Viktor. 
I was his regent.

120
00:09:32.984 --> 00:09:35.528
Until he met Selene.

121
00:09:35.695 --> 00:09:37.780
So you want her to hunt Marius?

122
00:09:37.947 --> 00:09:39.574
I want her to train our new recruits...

123
00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:42.660
so we have 100 Death Dealers
hunting Marius.


124
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:45.246
I doubt she will agree.

125
00:09:45.413 --> 00:09:47.123
Her only concern is for her daughter.

126
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.500
Eve, the hybrid.

127
00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:51.586
Unfortunately, the poor girl is half Lycan.

128
00:09:52.128 --> 00:09:54.148
It's a vampire's instinct
to condescend to Lycans...


129
00:09:54.172 --> 00:09:55.840
but they're not afraid to evolve.

130
00:09:56.007 --> 00:09:58.593
Meanwhile,
we stagnate from 1500 years...


131
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.930
of this damned "species purity"
nonsense.


132
00:10:02.347 --> 00:10:04.140
And the irony is that Selene...

133
00:10:04.307 --> 00:10:07.018
- is probably the purest of us all.
- So the rumor's true?


134
00:10:07.435 --> 00:10:09.562
Her blood has elements
of the Corvinus strain?


135
00:10:09.729 --> 00:10:11.606
She is special.

136
00:10:13.149 --> 00:10:15.068
She brought my son back
from the dead.


137
00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:19.405
- Her blood restarted his heart.
- Impossible.


138
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.577
I witnessed it myself.
She saved my son's life.


139
00:10:26.121 --> 00:10:28.748
Viktor and Amelia.

140
00:10:29.207 --> 00:10:32.252
Side by side for eternity.

141
00:10:34.963 --> 00:10:38.091
You were very fond of Amelia,
if I remember.


142
00:10:39.843 --> 00:10:43.847
- I need you to be my ally on this.
- She won't risk coming here...


143
00:10:44.013 --> 00:10:46.641
unless she gets an invitation
from the whole council.


144
00:10:46.808 --> 00:10:48.893
And I could never solicit such a request.

145
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.020
Cassius is protective of the old ways.

146
00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:54.357
He barely tolerates my seat
on the council as it is.


147
00:10:54.816 --> 00:10:57.652
But these are desperate times, Thomas.

148
00:10:57.819 --> 00:11:01.573
And that is why you
must convince the council to invite her.


149
00:11:03.074 --> 00:11:04.450
They arrive tonight.

150
00:11:04.617 --> 00:11:07.787
<i>Dawn alert.

151
00:11:37.192 --> 00:11:39.027
Marius, the pack leaders have arrived...

152
00:11:39.194 --> 00:11:41.613
and I told them to wait
for you in the war room.


153
00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:43.259
They're fighting like dogs, no doubt.

154
00:11:43.323 --> 00:11:45.825
- I'll handle it. Thank you.
- All right.


155
00:11:50.413 --> 00:11:51.915
- Go on, then.
- Right, right.


156
00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:53.082
Come around, come around.

157
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.834
No! Listen to me.

158
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:57.045
We're gonna wedge them in.
That's what we do.


159
00:11:57.212 --> 00:11:59.106
From this side and that side,
we just wedge them in...


160
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.770
- and squeeze them out.
- Wedge them in?


161
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.593
Is that your plan?
It's not going to lead to anything.


162
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.094
- He's getting angry.
- Shut up!


163
00:12:05.762 --> 00:12:07.639
Stop!

164
00:12:11.601 --> 00:12:13.603
- Are you a slave?
- No.


165
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.355
Then don't behave like one.

166
00:12:17.106 --> 00:12:18.775
Look at this map.

167
00:12:18.942 --> 00:12:20.568
What do you see?

168
00:12:20.735 --> 00:12:22.612
Do you see Lycans
fighting over scraps?


169
00:12:24.364 --> 00:12:26.115
I'll tell you what I see.

170
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:28.034
Volhynia.

171
00:12:28.576 --> 00:12:31.162
Nordgau. Thuringia.

172
00:12:31.329 --> 00:12:32.413
The Lycan victories.

173
00:12:34.374 --> 00:12:35.750
I see vampires dead.

174
00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:37.460
I see entire regions annihilated.

175
00:12:37.627 --> 00:12:40.004
But we will get no further
if we fight amongst ourselves.


176
00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:42.340
We must not rest...

177
00:12:42.507 --> 00:12:45.885
until we have destroyed
their final sanctuary.


178
00:12:46.469 --> 00:12:49.347
Together, we are strong.

179
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.810
And when we have the blood
of the hybrid girl...


180
00:12:55.645 --> 00:12:57.772
we will be invincible.

181
00:13:05.822 --> 00:13:07.323
Gregor.

182
00:13:09.033 --> 00:13:10.660
You have returned alone.

183
00:13:12.036 --> 00:13:14.247
- We were taken by surprise.
- Where is Selene?


184
00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:17.125
- She spared me.
- Why?


185
00:13:17.292 --> 00:13:18.710
To deliver a message.

186
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.839
She wants you to know
that her daughter is gone forever...


187
00:13:23.006 --> 00:13:24.549
that you can never find her...

188
00:13:24.716 --> 00:13:27.552
because even Selene
doesn't know where she's been hidden.


189
00:13:27.844 --> 00:13:28.845
Do you believe her?

190
00:13:33.308 --> 00:13:34.559
Do you believe her?

191
00:13:41.316 --> 00:13:43.943
I put a tracer in her companion.

192
00:13:45.487 --> 00:13:46.988
Well...

193
00:13:48.198 --> 00:13:51.075
that means you're not
completely incompetent.


194
00:14:05.548 --> 00:14:06.800
Try and stay still.

195
00:14:10.678 --> 00:14:13.306
- What is it?
- It's some sort of bullet.


196
00:14:13.473 --> 00:14:16.226
It's burrowing through you
faster than you can heal.


197
00:14:16.392 --> 00:14:17.685
It's self-propelled.

198
00:14:17.852 --> 00:14:21.272
That's what I was trying to tell you.
These Lycans are sophisticated.


199
00:14:24.317 --> 00:14:26.402
I don't know if I
can remove it in time.

200
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:28.850
Well, the least you can do
is attempt to sound reassuring.


201
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.990
I'm going to attempt not to kill you.

202
00:14:32.116 --> 00:14:33.952
That will have to do.

203
00:15:08.236 --> 00:15:12.031
To whom do you want us
to offer safe haven and amnesty?


204
00:15:12.198 --> 00:15:15.785
- To Selene the Death Dealer.
- The same Selene who murdered Viktor?


205
00:15:15.952 --> 00:15:17.912
I need no reminder, Cassius,
of what she has done.


206
00:15:18.037 --> 00:15:19.205
Shame on you, sir.

207
00:15:19.372 --> 00:15:22.250
I will not hear her name spoken again.

208
00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:24.544
Cassius, I share your outrage.

209
00:15:25.378 --> 00:15:27.464
Whatever has possessed you?

210
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.174
If we don't act decisively...

211
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.340
the war will be at your gate
within a fortnight.


212
00:15:31.843 --> 00:15:34.262
And that is precisely where it will remain.

213
00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:37.599
No Lycan pack would dare
to attack our coven.


214
00:15:37.765 --> 00:15:39.893
Our defenses would rip them apart.

215
00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:42.312
An ordinary Lycan pack, perhaps...

216
00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:45.648
but Marius has gathered a force
far more powerful than any...


217
00:15:45.815 --> 00:15:47.108
Unsubstantiated hyperbole.

218
00:15:47.275 --> 00:15:49.110
You need Selene.

219
00:15:49.277 --> 00:15:53.907
Her prowess, her leadership,
her intimate knowledge of Lycans.


220
00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:56.618
And her combat skills
are second to none.


221
00:15:56.784 --> 00:15:59.287
He's right, she is the most
lethal Death Dealer we've ever had.


222
00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:02.999
But she killed one of her own.

223
00:16:03.166 --> 00:16:07.212
Not only the most powerful
and respected of the Elders...


224
00:16:07.378 --> 00:16:11.800
her protector, who loved her
like his own daughter.


225
00:16:11.966 --> 00:16:13.843
She cannot be trusted.

226
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.261
She has been judged.

227
00:16:15.428 --> 00:16:18.014
Perhaps she can also be redeemed.

228
00:16:18.181 --> 00:16:20.683
It pains me to say it,
but Thomas is right.


229
00:16:21.142 --> 00:16:23.812
No warrior has proved herself
more in battle.


230
00:16:23.978 --> 00:16:27.232
She would be invaluable
in our fight against Marius...


231
00:16:27.398 --> 00:16:31.444
perhaps even the pivotal element
to secure our victory.


232
00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:35.990
If she can be found...

233
00:16:36.157 --> 00:16:40.662
and sets foot
within this precious coven...


234
00:16:40.954 --> 00:16:43.998
I will hold you, Semira,
personally responsible...


235
00:16:44.165 --> 00:16:45.917
- for controlling her.
- Of course.


236
00:17:10.316 --> 00:17:14.571
<i>Intruder. Intruder. Intruder.</i>

237
00:17:14.737 --> 00:17:16.614
<i>Intruder. Intruder.</i>

238
00:17:31.004 --> 00:17:32.630
Who sent you?

239
00:17:34.048 --> 00:17:35.717
Drop it.

240
00:17:41.181 --> 00:17:42.515
How'd you find us?

241
00:17:42.849 --> 00:17:44.934
There are only a handful
of safe houses left.


242
00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:48.021
The Lycans made it rather easy.

243
00:17:48.188 --> 00:17:50.607
The council of the Eastern Coven
sent me to bring you in.


244
00:17:50.773 --> 00:17:52.484
- For trial?
- No.


245
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.613
- For your safety, and ours.
- You cannot expect me to believe that.


246
00:17:56.779 --> 00:17:59.032
Every single one of them
signed my death warrant.


247
00:17:59.199 --> 00:18:01.326
- Times change.
- Vampires do not.


248
00:18:01.784 --> 00:18:03.036
This is from your father.

249
00:18:05.413 --> 00:18:07.457
Is it authentic?

250
00:18:07.624 --> 00:18:09.667
It's his seal, his handwriting.

251
00:18:09.834 --> 00:18:13.046
The council has offered you clemency
and granted us both safe haven.


252
00:18:13.213 --> 00:18:15.006
- Why?
- Marius.


253
00:18:15.173 --> 00:18:17.550
It is the council's humble request...

254
00:18:17.717 --> 00:18:20.386
that you train us
to defeat him and his army.


255
00:18:22.055 --> 00:18:23.223
Move. Come on.

256
00:18:23.389 --> 00:18:25.058
The signal's coming from this way.

257
00:18:26.392 --> 00:18:28.102
Look, I understand you're reluctant...

258
00:18:28.269 --> 00:18:31.105
but as guests of the council,
we will be protected by law.


259
00:18:31.272 --> 00:18:33.441
My father wouldn't lie,
and he holds no grudge.


260
00:18:33.608 --> 00:18:36.569
- He had no love for Viktor, either.
<i>- Intruder. Intruder.</i>


261
00:18:36.736 --> 00:18:38.863
- Lycans.
<i>- Intruder.</i>


262
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:44.035
- We must leave.
- You should accept the council's offer.


263
00:18:44.202 --> 00:18:46.121
- For Eve.
- Eve does not want my help.


264
00:18:46.287 --> 00:18:48.623
I know you want to protect her.
And if we destroy Marius...


265
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.959
we destroy the greatest threat
to her safety.


266
00:18:51.126 --> 00:18:52.418
Now.

267
00:19:09.227 --> 00:19:10.562
Marius.

268
00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:15.275
We just missed them.

269
00:19:15.441 --> 00:19:18.987
I do not wish to hear
the word "just" again.


270
00:19:19.529 --> 00:19:21.739
Either we have her or we have nothing.

271
00:19:23.241 --> 00:19:24.951
Do you understand?

272
00:19:25.118 --> 00:19:27.203
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.


273
00:19:44.971 --> 00:19:46.723
<i>Tango Charlie approaching.</i>

274
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.266
<i>All clear.</i>

275
00:19:49.726 --> 00:19:51.436
<i>Perimeter secure.</i>

276
00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:06.951
- Welcome.
- Am I?


277
00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:09.662
Our coven's resources
and weaponry are yours...


278
00:20:09.829 --> 00:20:13.416
to transform these raw recruits
into Death Dealers worthy of your name.


279
00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:15.710
Varga will be your right-hand man.

280
00:20:15.877 --> 00:20:17.587
He knows all our strengths
and weaknesses.


281
00:20:17.754 --> 00:20:21.341
He is also our most prolific Lycan killer
with over 40 confirmed kills.


282
00:20:21.508 --> 00:20:23.426
- It's an honor.
- David, welcome.


283
00:20:23.593 --> 00:20:26.304
- Thank you.
- To mark the safe arrival of our guests...


284
00:20:26.471 --> 00:20:28.640
I've arranged a little soiree
in the Winter Garden.


285
00:20:29.015 --> 00:20:30.642
There's really no need. Thank you.

286
00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:33.561
Nonsense. There's always a need
to indulge in pleasure.


287
00:20:57.085 --> 00:20:58.795
In times of war...

288
00:20:58.962 --> 00:21:01.798
this coven needs moments to celebrate.

289
00:21:02.048 --> 00:21:05.927
The arrival of Thomas,
David and Selene...


290
00:21:06.094 --> 00:21:09.055
is reason aplenty to rejoice.

291
00:21:10.348 --> 00:21:12.392
To us all.

292
00:21:25.363 --> 00:21:27.657
It's good of you to offer us
sanctuary, Semira. Thank you.


293
00:21:27.824 --> 00:21:30.285
It will be entirely my pleasure.

294
00:21:30.493 --> 00:21:34.205
Tell me, is it true that her blood
brought you back to life?


295
00:21:34.372 --> 00:21:35.748
Yes, it is.

296
00:21:35.915 --> 00:21:37.667
I owe her everything.

297
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.255
But, if you'll excuse me,
my father requests my counsel.


298
00:21:44.632 --> 00:21:46.259
Thomas was always such a bore.

299
00:21:50.305 --> 00:21:53.391
Well, Semira's certainly taken
an interest in you.


300
00:21:53.558 --> 00:21:56.311
Well, the interest is certainly not mutual.

301
00:21:56.478 --> 00:21:58.771
We need her protection.

302
00:21:58.938 --> 00:22:01.566
On the contrary,
I think I need protection from her.


303
00:22:01.733 --> 00:22:03.401
The Battle of the Peste.

304
00:22:04.152 --> 00:22:06.488
We thought it would be
the one to end the war...


305
00:22:06.654 --> 00:22:08.031
the final conflict...

306
00:22:08.198 --> 00:22:10.033
but here we are still.

307
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.870
I hope you see my bid for clemency
for Selene for what it is.


308
00:22:14.037 --> 00:22:15.917
Well, clemency
is the least you can offer her...


309
00:22:15.955 --> 00:22:17.475
after bartering her daughter
to the Lycans.


310
00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:21.127
I lost so much during this war.

311
00:22:21.294 --> 00:22:24.631
Believe me, I am haunted still
by all those I failed.


312
00:22:24.798 --> 00:22:27.342
Well, then you must help me protect her.

313
00:22:27.509 --> 00:22:29.511
She has lost even more
than we can imagine.


314
00:22:29.677 --> 00:22:31.721
And she's important to me.

315
00:22:42.982 --> 00:22:45.318
Marius is out there...

316
00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:49.656
reeking of canine insolence,
plotting our downfall.


317
00:22:52.367 --> 00:22:56.329
We do not need Selene to destroy him.

318
00:22:57.288 --> 00:22:58.873
I am more than capable.

319
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.543
No, Varga, you are merely adequate.

320
00:23:01.709 --> 00:23:05.255
It's fortunate that we're not forced
to rely on your skills for our survival.


321
00:23:05.672 --> 00:23:08.758
That, my sweet...

322
00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.344
yet unimaginative bedfellow...

323
00:23:11.511 --> 00:23:12.887
is my area of expertise.

324
00:23:13.054 --> 00:23:14.814
- I think you should...
- Don't think, Varga.


325
00:23:14.973 --> 00:23:16.724
You'll hurt yourself.

326
00:23:17.475 --> 00:23:21.521
There are other ways
to prove your devotion.


327
00:23:32.782 --> 00:23:37.245
Piece by delicate piece...

328
00:23:40.457 --> 00:23:43.126
the puzzle will fall into place.

329
00:23:45.003 --> 00:23:47.088
Oh, yeah...

330
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:50.049
Yeah...

331
00:24:28.004 --> 00:24:30.256
Don't aim where the Lycan is. Anticipate.

332
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:37.639
And remember...

333
00:24:37.806 --> 00:24:40.284
a Lycan is never more vulnerable
than when he's in wolf form.


334
00:24:40.308 --> 00:24:41.893
- What?
- That makes no sense.


335
00:24:43.728 --> 00:24:45.288
In wolf form,
they cannot use weapons...


336
00:24:45.396 --> 00:24:47.774
and their thinking
becomes much more primitive...


337
00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:49.150
driven only by bloodlust.

338
00:24:49.317 --> 00:24:52.070
- How many have you killed?
- I don't keep track.


339
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.365
I'm increasing Lycan speed
by 20 percent.


340
00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.536
Please continue.

341
00:25:04.707 --> 00:25:07.544
My pack has probed the Eastern Coven's
perimeter for weaknesses...


342
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:08.711
and there are none.

343
00:25:08.878 --> 00:25:10.918
And any direct assault
would trigger the lockdown...


344
00:25:11.047 --> 00:25:12.527
which makes the coven impregnable.

345
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.390
Even if we could break inside
without losing 90 percent of our force...


346
00:25:15.552 --> 00:25:17.154
- they have fallback positions...
- This.


347
00:25:17.178 --> 00:25:19.931
- That can be...
- Is this ready?


348
00:25:20.098 --> 00:25:21.766
Yeah.

349
00:25:21.933 --> 00:25:24.394
When we have the hybrid's blood...

350
00:25:24.561 --> 00:25:26.312
we launch against the Eastern.

351
00:25:26.479 --> 00:25:28.773
Find Selene, and we find her daughter.

352
00:25:33.653 --> 00:25:35.572
My own invention.

353
00:25:35.738 --> 00:25:37.550
One of the first things
a Death Dealer must learn...


354
00:25:37.574 --> 00:25:39.093
is how to fight in a confined space.

355
00:25:39.117 --> 00:25:42.620
Of course, the one thing this
training session lacks is unpredictability.


356
00:25:43.913 --> 00:25:46.374
Perhaps you'll indulge me
and give my students...


357
00:25:46.541 --> 00:25:50.837
I should say your students.
A lesson in combat's unpredictability.


358
00:25:51.004 --> 00:25:54.883
It would not only honor us, but it
would be invaluable to their training.


359
00:25:55.049 --> 00:25:56.885
- I don't...
- Please.


360
00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:00.138
That's enough.

361
00:26:01.181 --> 00:26:04.350
Gather round.
We are going to school you...


362
00:26:04.517 --> 00:26:07.562
in the true nature of the Lycan warrior.

363
00:26:07.729 --> 00:26:11.774
For the sake of this lesson,
our esteemed guest Selene...


364
00:26:11.941 --> 00:26:15.320
will play the role of Death Dealer
bravely defending our fortress...


365
00:26:15.487 --> 00:26:19.073
and I will take the role
of Lycan villain...


366
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.783
here to destroy it.

367
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.452
Ladies first.

368
00:26:45.308 --> 00:26:46.392
Impressive.

369
00:26:54.317 --> 00:26:55.693
Come on.

370
00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:59.906
Come on.

371
00:27:39.946 --> 00:27:41.489
Tonight's lesson:

372
00:27:41.656 --> 00:27:45.034
Do not trust your opponent
to fight with honor.


373
00:27:45.201 --> 00:27:47.245
They are Lycan. 
They have none.

374
00:27:51.583 --> 00:27:52.792
Don't move.

375
00:28:01.009 --> 00:28:02.927
Nightshade.

376
00:28:03.094 --> 00:28:05.513
Leeches into vampire cells, usually fatal.

377
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.933
But for one with her strength,
there will only be pain...


378
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.310
followed by paralysis.

379
00:28:10.477 --> 00:28:12.020
I'll kill you.

380
00:28:13.313 --> 00:28:15.356
UV bullets.

381
00:28:21.196 --> 00:28:24.491
Did you honestly think
I would forgive you for killing Viktor?


382
00:28:24.657 --> 00:28:26.534
Varga, you have orders.

383
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.330
Varga!

384
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.112
I don't need you to train Death Dealers.

385
00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:05.198
I have Varga for that.

386
00:29:05.365 --> 00:29:08.034
All that I need to rule this coven...

387
00:29:08.201 --> 00:29:12.956
and end the march of the Lycans
is your blood.


388
00:29:20.171 --> 00:29:21.464
What about the bodies?

389
00:29:23.883 --> 00:29:25.301
Sound the alarm.

390
00:29:25.844 --> 00:29:28.096
Have the council find them.

391
00:29:28.263 --> 00:29:33.518
Conclusive evidence of the atrocity
committed by Selene.


392
00:29:42.902 --> 00:29:44.154
There's been a breach.

393
00:29:44.863 --> 00:29:45.905
We need to find Selene.

394
00:29:46.072 --> 00:29:49.534
- Cordoned off. Semira's orders.
- Step aside.


395
00:29:52.996 --> 00:29:54.247
David.

396
00:29:55.498 --> 00:29:56.666
Come.

397
00:29:57.125 --> 00:30:00.378
There's more than one way
to move around this coven.


398
00:30:00.545 --> 00:30:03.423
Amelia created these passageways
centuries ago.


399
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.553
Where does this lead?

400
00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.348
To the private chambers,
including Semira's.


401
00:30:38.208 --> 00:30:39.876
What the hell have they done to her?

402
00:30:40.043 --> 00:30:43.171
<i>Machina sanguinem exhauri.</i>

403
00:30:43.338 --> 00:30:45.840
Bloodletting.

404
00:30:48.301 --> 00:30:52.472
Semira wants Selene's
most precious asset.


405
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:55.558
- This is going to kill her.
- Eventually, yes...


406
00:30:55.725 --> 00:30:58.394
but it will be agonizingly slow.

407
00:31:03.358 --> 00:31:04.901
Look.

408
00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:08.571
This is designed to open the arteries
as wide as possible.


409
00:31:08.738 --> 00:31:12.033
If we're not very careful,
we will do her more harm than good.


410
00:31:12.575 --> 00:31:13.868
Careful.

411
00:31:32.387 --> 00:31:34.264
Is this hers?

412
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:35.431
Yes.

413
00:31:35.598 --> 00:31:38.184
Selene uses only this
particular weapon.


414
00:31:40.103 --> 00:31:41.938
A known traitor within our walls.

415
00:31:42.105 --> 00:31:43.731
This is precisely what I foresaw...

416
00:31:43.898 --> 00:31:47.193
and what you assured me
you would prevent.


417
00:31:47.485 --> 00:31:49.279
Their blood is upon your hands.

418
00:31:49.445 --> 00:31:51.489
- Sir, I did everything...
- Do not speak to me.


419
00:31:51.656 --> 00:31:52.866
There can be no mercy.

420
00:31:53.032 --> 00:31:55.618
I want her hunted
to the ends of the Earth.


421
00:31:55.785 --> 00:31:57.662
It shall be done.

422
00:31:59.247 --> 00:32:01.082
And I want her captured alive.

423
00:32:03.835 --> 00:32:05.962
Is that understood?

424
00:32:06.129 --> 00:32:08.047
Perfectly.

425
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.767
- We're running out of time.
- All right, take her.


426
00:32:19.934 --> 00:32:21.895
You must go north, far north.

427
00:32:22.061 --> 00:32:23.563
Var Dohr.

428
00:32:25.523 --> 00:32:26.733
No.

429
00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.860
Father and son united in treason.

430
00:32:29.027 --> 00:32:30.737
Carry on with Selene.

431
00:32:31.863 --> 00:32:32.864
I'll deal with them.

432
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.291
Come on.

433
00:32:54.677 --> 00:32:55.970
Go! Now!

434
00:32:56.763 --> 00:32:58.264
No!

435
00:33:07.482 --> 00:33:10.527
<i>Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

436
00:33:10.693 --> 00:33:13.404
Go ahead. The sun will burn you
to ashes out there...


437
00:33:13.571 --> 00:33:15.573
or you can die
with some grace in here.


438
00:33:45.228 --> 00:33:46.688
They can walk in the sun.

439
00:34:05.165 --> 00:34:07.667
You need to feed.
You've lost too much blood.


440
00:34:25.768 --> 00:34:28.521
That child... Because he
helped that child of yours.


441
00:34:28.688 --> 00:34:31.107
My son is dead. Dead.

442
00:34:31.316 --> 00:34:32.358
David.

443
00:34:33.485 --> 00:34:34.486
Take her now.

444
00:34:34.652 --> 00:34:36.279
You must go north. Var Dohr.

445
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:40.658
Go! Now!

446
00:34:53.254 --> 00:34:54.964
Thank you.

447
00:34:58.676 --> 00:35:02.555
I'm very sorry
that you lost your father.


448
00:35:02.889 --> 00:35:05.517
He put up a valiant fight.

449
00:35:06.017 --> 00:35:09.270
It's strange to lose someone
you feel like you never really knew.


450
00:35:11.272 --> 00:35:13.358
I feel the same about my mother, but...

451
00:35:14.567 --> 00:35:16.611
I have almost no memory of her.

452
00:35:17.695 --> 00:35:19.364
And I of Eve.

453
00:35:20.657 --> 00:35:22.450
I didn't want her.

454
00:35:22.951 --> 00:35:24.452
I didn't know her.

455
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.371
And now I've lost her.

456
00:35:26.538 --> 00:35:28.790
Why do you insist on saying
that you've lost her?


457
00:35:29.332 --> 00:35:32.877
She made me promise
I would never look for her...


458
00:35:33.044 --> 00:35:35.755
that I would never consider myself
having a daughter.


459
00:35:36.548 --> 00:35:37.757
And she was right.

460
00:35:39.634 --> 00:35:42.095
Nothing good has come
to anyone I love.


461
00:35:42.595 --> 00:35:46.015
You're family,
and you're all I have left.


462
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.436
Well, then, you really are in trouble.

463
00:35:52.397 --> 00:35:54.357
You need to rest.

464
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:05.368
Selene's clearly in league
with the Lycans.


465
00:36:05.827 --> 00:36:08.621
Thomas and David were complicit
in this treachery.


466
00:36:08.788 --> 00:36:12.208
They walked in the sun. This alone
is evidence of Lycan collusion.


467
00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:15.336
Selene must be wiped from the pages
of our proud history.


468
00:36:15.503 --> 00:36:16.546
Alexia.

469
00:36:16.713 --> 00:36:19.632
- We shall avenge our fallen.
- See to it that you do.


470
00:36:45.783 --> 00:36:49.871
- How much nightshade did you use?
- I thought it best to err on the side...


471
00:36:50.079 --> 00:36:52.457
Varga, what have we said
about you thinking?


472
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:54.626
The poison will dissipate.

473
00:36:54.793 --> 00:36:58.087
I need this blood untainted,
and I need it now.


474
00:36:58.254 --> 00:37:00.381
It cannot be rushed.

475
00:37:00.924 --> 00:37:02.258
It must run its course.

476
00:37:06.638 --> 00:37:08.389
It's definitely the car.

477
00:37:08.556 --> 00:37:11.976
But no sign of where they went.

478
00:37:12.602 --> 00:37:14.187
Spread out across the city.

479
00:37:14.354 --> 00:37:15.939
Search everywhere.

480
00:37:23.238 --> 00:37:26.616
<i>The train at platform four
terminates at this station.</i>


481
00:37:43.466 --> 00:37:45.009
Northbound.

482
00:37:59.482 --> 00:38:02.318
I will be more powerful...

483
00:38:03.528 --> 00:38:05.488
than Cassius...

484
00:38:07.782 --> 00:38:09.826
than any vampire in this coven.

485
00:38:17.917 --> 00:38:20.437
- What news of the search?
- Selene and David are heading north.


486
00:38:20.545 --> 00:38:22.881
- Of course they are.
- Your Grace?


487
00:38:23.047 --> 00:38:25.049
They will run to the only
remaining coven...


488
00:38:25.216 --> 00:38:28.428
to afford them safe haven:
Var Dohr, the Nordic fortress.


489
00:38:28.595 --> 00:38:30.346
But Var Dohr is only a legend.

490
00:38:30.513 --> 00:38:33.057
I would not give it
such an elevated status.


491
00:38:33.224 --> 00:38:37.645
It is a frigid, dreary outpost
full of pathetic, peace-loving cowards.


492
00:38:37.812 --> 00:38:40.190
You speak of it
as if you have actually been there.


493
00:38:40.356 --> 00:38:44.652
Where do you think I was
when Viktor wasted years with Selene?


494
00:38:45.904 --> 00:38:47.530
Prepare yourself.

495
00:38:47.697 --> 00:38:50.492
The journey's long,
and I need you to take it alone.


496
00:38:51.493 --> 00:38:53.787
I must be certain the traitor's there...

497
00:38:53.953 --> 00:38:57.874
before I risk sending a full squad
of Death Dealers so far from this coven.


498
00:39:30.156 --> 00:39:31.741
You need to be more careful.

499
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.043
You need to be more gentle.

500
00:39:46.673 --> 00:39:48.258
- Have you found Selene?
- Yes.


501
00:39:48.424 --> 00:39:50.468
She is headed for the Nordic Coven.

502
00:39:52.971 --> 00:39:55.598
I risk everything for this.

503
00:39:55.765 --> 00:39:59.727
- For you, for us.
- I know, my love.


504
00:39:59.894 --> 00:40:03.189
Semira grows more insane
for power with each day.


505
00:40:03.356 --> 00:40:04.983
She must be stopped.

506
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:08.153
And every day, I fear more
what she will do if we are discovered.


507
00:40:09.654 --> 00:40:13.783
I cannot attack the Eastern Coven
without the blood of the hybrid.


508
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.828
It's too strong, even for my horde.

509
00:40:17.954 --> 00:40:19.581
Selene...

510
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:24.461
She is the key to the futures
of Lycans and vampires alike.


511
00:40:24.919 --> 00:40:26.880
You shall have her.

512
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.451
Var Dohr is just beyond that ridge.

513
00:42:57.405 --> 00:42:59.282
Where is everyone?

514
00:43:00.074 --> 00:43:01.743
Watching.

515
00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.753
We come seeking sanctuary...

516
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.546
not to fight.

517
00:43:14.964 --> 00:43:17.008
Then you've come to the right place.

518
00:43:22.055 --> 00:43:23.848
My name is Lena.

519
00:43:24.015 --> 00:43:25.850
Follow me.

520
00:43:27.101 --> 00:43:28.770
What was that?

521
00:43:28.937 --> 00:43:30.855
Some kind of trick.

522
00:43:58.007 --> 00:43:59.509
You must be Selene.

523
00:44:00.093 --> 00:44:02.512
Does the great Death Dealer
truly come in peace?


524
00:44:03.138 --> 00:44:05.140
- I do.
- And what about this one?


525
00:44:05.306 --> 00:44:07.517
This is David, son of Thomas.

526
00:44:07.684 --> 00:44:11.187
Who I haven't seen
for many, many years.


527
00:44:14.065 --> 00:44:15.900
You must excuse the attention.

528
00:44:16.067 --> 00:44:19.445
Our coven doesn't receive
many guests, by design.


529
00:44:19.612 --> 00:44:20.613
We do as we wish...

530
00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.366
- not as others would have us do.
- And what of the Lycans?


531
00:44:23.533 --> 00:44:25.869
We are too far removed
for them to take notice...


532
00:44:26.035 --> 00:44:30.248
and even if they did, our climate
is quite an obstacle to warm-bloods.


533
00:44:30.707 --> 00:44:32.750
This coven wouldn't exist...

534
00:44:32.917 --> 00:44:35.503
- without your mother's grace.
- You knew my mother?


535
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.297
All vampires do, my boy.

536
00:44:37.464 --> 00:44:39.799
No. My mother was low-born.
She died giving birth to me.


537
00:44:39.966 --> 00:44:43.303
A falsehood, you will find,
designed to keep your true lineage safe.


538
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:44.929
- Is she still alive?
- No.


539
00:44:45.472 --> 00:44:48.433
And her death
was a terrible blow to our kind.


540
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.269
The mourning ceremony we held
lasted for an entire month.


541
00:44:51.436 --> 00:44:54.147
Such an honor
is usually reserved for a high-born...


542
00:44:54.314 --> 00:44:55.940
- a Grand Elder.
- Yes.


543
00:44:58.401 --> 00:45:00.153
- Amelia.
- Yes.


544
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.822
How could a Grand Elder
have been my mother...


545
00:45:02.989 --> 00:45:04.199
and I not been told?

546
00:45:04.866 --> 00:45:06.701
I have something for you.

547
00:45:22.425 --> 00:45:26.012
Your father's greatest work,
infused with silver.


548
00:45:26.179 --> 00:45:28.765
The Lycans will cower
from the very sight of it.


549
00:45:28.932 --> 00:45:31.476
- It's beautiful.
- Thomas knew that one day...


550
00:45:31.643 --> 00:45:33.895
you would be beset
by enemies on both sides...


551
00:45:34.062 --> 00:45:35.104
and he was right.

552
00:45:35.271 --> 00:45:38.650
David, this means that you are
the rightful heir of the Eastern Coven.


553
00:45:38.817 --> 00:45:41.611
Your mother and father
spent many months...


554
00:45:41.778 --> 00:45:43.905
within the safety of these walls.

555
00:45:44.531 --> 00:45:45.907
Viktor grew suspicious.

556
00:45:46.074 --> 00:45:48.201
Then your father spirited you away...

557
00:45:48.368 --> 00:45:51.871
before Semira arrived with her troops.

558
00:45:53.331 --> 00:45:56.251
- And what of my mother?
- She returned to the Eastern Coven.


559
00:45:56.417 --> 00:45:57.585
The light in her eyes...

560
00:45:57.752 --> 00:46:00.630
Don't try and fabricate
some kind of martyrdom for her.


561
00:46:00.797 --> 00:46:02.566
I prefer a more honest
appraisal of her decision.


562
00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:06.052
She abandoned her only son
for the sake of her precious council.


563
00:46:06.219 --> 00:46:08.596
- Take it.
- David.


564
00:46:08.763 --> 00:46:10.348
David.

565
00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:15.061
Amelia asked me to give him this.

566
00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:35.039
What do you need?

567
00:46:35.206 --> 00:46:37.000
Nothing. I just need to be left alone.

568
00:46:38.042 --> 00:46:39.711
Yes, I know the feeling.

569
00:46:40.462 --> 00:46:42.297
Why didn't my father
tell me about my mother?


570
00:46:42.755 --> 00:46:44.340
I did not know your father well...

571
00:46:44.507 --> 00:46:46.968
but I know that his greatest fear
was to lose you.


572
00:46:47.135 --> 00:46:50.847
It seems it's the curse of every parent
to disappoint their child.


573
00:46:51.014 --> 00:46:54.309
- At least you fought for your child, Selene.
- Yes, and lost.


574
00:46:55.143 --> 00:46:57.979
You have pure-blood heritage, David.
Your mother was an Elder.


575
00:46:58.313 --> 00:47:00.607
Your parents kept you safe
for a reason.


576
00:47:00.773 --> 00:47:03.568
They protected you
so that one day you could lead.


577
00:47:05.737 --> 00:47:07.030
Your mother left you a gift.

578
00:47:10.575 --> 00:47:12.887
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but I have no use for jewelry.


579
00:47:12.911 --> 00:47:15.121
The ring is not the gift.

580
00:47:15.455 --> 00:47:17.999
It contains the gift: A mother's love.

581
00:47:19.209 --> 00:47:21.169
A single drop of her blood.

582
00:47:21.628 --> 00:47:23.505
Maybe it'll help you decide.

583
00:47:59.582 --> 00:48:01.292
You're just in time.

584
00:48:01.793 --> 00:48:04.587
- Come.
- What is this?


585
00:48:04.754 --> 00:48:07.924
- Valissa, the in-between place.
- Is she dead?


586
00:48:08.091 --> 00:48:10.009
No.

587
00:48:11.094 --> 00:48:12.679
She is...

588
00:48:13.596 --> 00:48:14.597
becoming.

589
00:48:14.806 --> 00:48:16.099
She took a poison.

590
00:48:16.266 --> 00:48:18.268
It allows her to visit the Sacred World.

591
00:48:18.685 --> 00:48:21.938
When she returns,
she will see this world with new eyes.


592
00:48:22.438 --> 00:48:23.940
I don't understand what this is.

593
00:48:24.107 --> 00:48:27.277
We have long known
there is more than just this world.


594
00:48:27.944 --> 00:48:30.155
When my father
first brought me down here...


595
00:48:30.321 --> 00:48:31.781
I felt as you do now...

596
00:48:31.948 --> 00:48:35.952
but I have since been
to the Sacred World many times.


597
00:48:37.203 --> 00:48:40.039
My eyes see beyond the surface
of so many things.


598
00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:43.710
- I see much about you.
- Such as?


599
00:48:43.877 --> 00:48:46.504
I can see you've loved a Lycan...

600
00:48:46.671 --> 00:48:49.799
- killed a vampire Elder, and given birth...
- Stop.


601
00:48:53.094 --> 00:48:56.514
I see you have lost your daughter...

602
00:48:56.681 --> 00:48:59.142
and how much pain
this gives you deep inside...


603
00:48:59.309 --> 00:49:01.269
where you will always hide it.

604
00:49:04.981 --> 00:49:06.357
She's a special child.

605
00:49:06.524 --> 00:49:08.818
Many battles will be fought...

606
00:49:09.611 --> 00:49:11.654
and lost over her.

607
00:49:11.821 --> 00:49:13.907
- What else do you see?
- Darkness.


608
00:49:14.073 --> 00:49:15.825
One that touches us all.

609
00:49:16.242 --> 00:49:20.246
If you want to keep her safe,
you will need to go further...


610
00:49:20.413 --> 00:49:24.375
than even a warrior of your renown
has ever ventured before.


611
00:49:24.542 --> 00:49:27.295
I have seen so much war...

612
00:49:27.462 --> 00:49:29.547
so much killing.

613
00:49:29.714 --> 00:49:30.882
I cannot bear more.

614
00:49:31.049 --> 00:49:33.426
The peace you will feel here is real.

615
00:49:33.593 --> 00:49:37.055
It seeps into your skin
and comforts your soul.


616
00:49:37.222 --> 00:49:39.224
Tell me about the Sacred World.

617
00:49:39.891 --> 00:49:42.143
The water is the path.

618
00:49:59.577 --> 00:50:00.578
<i>Amelia!</i>

619
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:12.966
<i>I name our son David.</i>

620
00:50:13.133 --> 00:50:14.467
<i>David.</i>

621
00:50:15.426 --> 00:50:17.679
<i>One day, you will understand.</i>

622
00:50:17.846 --> 00:50:20.348
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

623
00:50:38.616 --> 00:50:40.076
Lycans! Sound the alarm!

624
00:50:40.243 --> 00:50:41.327
Close the doors!

625
00:50:42.036 --> 00:50:43.413
Move!

626
00:50:50.044 --> 00:50:53.631
Just as I spoke of peace,
war has followed you here.


627
00:50:53.798 --> 00:50:55.008
Protect your own.

628
00:50:55.175 --> 00:50:56.885
I must find David.

629
00:51:05.101 --> 00:51:08.021
- We have to get you away.
- No. We led the Lycans here.


630
00:51:08.188 --> 00:51:10.523
We can't let these people die.

631
00:52:10.667 --> 00:52:12.460
Run!

632
00:52:20.135 --> 00:52:21.219
This way, men.

633
00:52:23.972 --> 00:52:26.099
Go around that side.

634
00:53:01.509 --> 00:53:02.719
There she is.

635
00:53:24.073 --> 00:53:25.617
You parasite.

636
00:53:25.783 --> 00:53:26.993
Just do it.

637
00:54:25.468 --> 00:54:26.469
Marius.

638
00:54:27.387 --> 00:54:28.763
At last.

639
00:54:54.038 --> 00:54:55.206
On your right!

640
00:55:28.698 --> 00:55:30.200
I expected more from you.

641
00:55:48.802 --> 00:55:50.261
Tell me where your daughter is.

642
00:55:51.596 --> 00:55:53.640
I don't know.

643
00:55:54.057 --> 00:55:57.268
Selene, all I want is her blood.

644
00:56:08.905 --> 00:56:11.449
Only she can end this war.

645
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:16.079
I give you my word
she will not be killed.


646
00:56:44.065 --> 00:56:45.066
What are you?

647
00:58:07.065 --> 00:58:08.233
Tell him where she is...

648
00:58:08.399 --> 00:58:10.652
and all this butchery
will be over forever.


649
00:58:10.819 --> 00:58:12.862
I don't know.

650
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:14.656
Lies.

651
00:58:21.955 --> 00:58:22.956
They've gone.

652
00:58:23.957 --> 00:58:25.500
<i>Michael.</i>

653
00:58:26.376 --> 00:58:29.337
- I freed you.
<i>- Look at the eyes.</i>


654
00:58:30.046 --> 00:58:31.714
<i>Who I am?
Do you not know who I am?</i>


655
00:58:31.881 --> 00:58:33.800
<i>- My daughter.
- I don't want you.</i>


656
00:58:33.967 --> 00:58:35.718
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

657
00:58:36.928 --> 00:58:38.680
She's telling the truth.

658
00:58:40.932 --> 00:58:42.100
She doesn't know.

659
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.779
My time is done.

660
00:59:08.334 --> 00:59:10.545
They are retreating.

661
00:59:16.384 --> 00:59:18.261
I'm running out of time.

662
00:59:18.428 --> 00:59:20.763
We must strike against
the Eastern Coven now.


663
00:59:22.432 --> 00:59:24.058
You know what you must do.

664
00:59:34.986 --> 00:59:37.280
Water is the path.

665
01:00:09.562 --> 01:00:10.939
Selene.

666
01:00:24.911 --> 01:00:26.496
<i>Praise the day...</i>

667
01:00:27.956 --> 01:00:29.707
<i>when it ends.</i>

668
01:00:29.916 --> 01:00:32.418
<i>Praise the ice...</i>

669
01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:34.212
<i>when it holds.</i>

670
01:00:35.004 --> 01:00:36.214
<i>Praise the sword...</i>

671
01:00:36.798 --> 01:00:38.842
<i>when it kills.</i>

672
01:00:40.218 --> 01:00:41.803
<i>Praise the life...</i>

673
01:00:42.846 --> 01:00:44.681
<i>that has lived.</i>

674
01:00:54.232 --> 01:00:56.067
It's time.

675
01:00:59.737 --> 01:01:01.114
Power.

676
01:01:01.281 --> 01:01:03.783
Such a seductively simple thing.

677
01:01:04.242 --> 01:01:07.412
Either you have it all
or you have nothing.


678
01:01:44.741 --> 01:01:46.868
How fascinating.

679
01:01:50.455 --> 01:01:52.707
<i>Amelia...</i>

680
01:01:53.291 --> 01:01:56.836
<i>The water is the path.</i>

681
01:02:08.264 --> 01:02:10.225
You should stay here, David.

682
01:02:10.391 --> 01:02:12.602
This can be your home.

683
01:02:12.769 --> 01:02:14.187
Marius is heading east.

684
01:02:14.354 --> 01:02:15.897
There's nothing stopping him now.

685
01:02:16.523 --> 01:02:19.484
And my people are beset
with enemies on all sides.


686
01:02:19.734 --> 01:02:21.736
How can I stay here and live...

687
01:02:22.445 --> 01:02:25.448
- while they die?
- They need a leader.


688
01:02:40.421 --> 01:02:42.590
<i>Gate secure. 
Perimeter check.</i>

689
01:02:44.551 --> 01:02:46.052
Miss me?

690
01:02:46.219 --> 01:02:48.555
<i>- East gate is clear.
- West gate clear.</i>


691
01:02:49.514 --> 01:02:51.516
<i>Commencing perimeter sweep.</i>

692
01:02:54.352 --> 01:02:55.687
<i>Access granted.</i>

693
01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:03.319
What news do you bring?

694
01:03:03.486 --> 01:03:04.863
A massacre.

695
01:03:05.822 --> 01:03:08.408
The Lycans attacked
the fortress of Var Dohr.


696
01:03:08.575 --> 01:03:10.034
Lycans in the north.

697
01:03:12.370 --> 01:03:15.457
The Nordic Coven
was taken completely by surprise.


698
01:03:15.665 --> 01:03:19.377
- Dozens of vampires have been killed.
- Was Selene amongst them?


699
01:03:19.544 --> 01:03:22.922
Dead. Killed by Marius himself.

700
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:25.508
Wherever Selene goes,
trouble surely follows.


701
01:03:25.675 --> 01:03:28.052
- What of David?
- I do not know.


702
01:03:28.219 --> 01:03:31.473
I only wished I had arrived sooner.
I might have helped in some way.


703
01:03:31.639 --> 01:03:34.309
Well, you've helped in so many ways.

704
01:03:34.476 --> 01:03:38.730
You've done exactly as I hoped
and planned, if not more.


705
01:03:39.939 --> 01:03:44.027
You see, information is power.

706
01:03:48.531 --> 01:03:52.160
And I collect it with a passion.

707
01:04:01.461 --> 01:04:04.464
Thank you for leading Marius
to the Nordic Coven.


708
01:04:04.631 --> 01:04:07.217
Your Lycan lover...

709
01:04:07.884 --> 01:04:11.012
must be delighted
with his momentary success.


710
01:04:12.388 --> 01:04:14.390
You thought I didn't know.

711
01:04:17.227 --> 01:04:19.312
Foolish girl.

712
01:04:27.862 --> 01:04:30.698
<i>Dawn alert.

713
01:04:34.994 --> 01:04:38.957
The Lycan scourge
destroyed an entire coven.


714
01:04:39.124 --> 01:04:41.251
To hide behind these walls
increases their advantage.


715
01:04:41.417 --> 01:04:43.294
We cannot take the war to Marius.

716
01:04:43.461 --> 01:04:45.630
Should we cower in the safety
of these walls...


717
01:04:45.797 --> 01:04:49.384
- while he picks us off one by one?
- Curb your insidious comments, Semira.


718
01:04:49.551 --> 01:04:52.095
This coven has held for 15 centuries.

719
01:04:52.262 --> 01:04:55.932
- It will hold for 15 more.
- I hoped you would show strength...


720
01:04:56.099 --> 01:04:59.686
though I was willing
to settle for competence.


721
01:05:02.438 --> 01:05:03.648
I was wrong.

722
01:05:07.443 --> 01:05:09.404
What is the meaning of this?

723
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:12.282
If this council is too weak
to take action...


724
01:05:12.448 --> 01:05:14.075
it is my duty to do so.

725
01:05:14.242 --> 01:05:19.122
You are relieved of your duties
as council members effective immediately.


726
01:05:22.542 --> 01:05:24.586
The traitor returns.

727
01:05:26.504 --> 01:05:29.132
Oh, you are a fool
to show your face here.


728
01:05:29.883 --> 01:05:31.926
I will make you pay
for what you've done, Semira.


729
01:05:32.427 --> 01:05:34.507
Marius and his army
are heading this way as we speak.


730
01:05:35.346 --> 01:05:37.932
- I come to save my people.
- Your people?


731
01:05:38.099 --> 01:05:40.101
Kill him. Kill him.

732
01:05:40.268 --> 01:05:42.687
You aspire to be the protector
of your bloodline...


733
01:05:42.854 --> 01:05:45.315
yet you kill your own kind
in pursuit of power.


734
01:05:45.482 --> 01:05:46.524
It ends now.

735
01:05:47.442 --> 01:05:50.778
I am David,
son of the great Elder Amelia.


736
01:05:51.654 --> 01:05:54.199
And I am the
rightful heir to this coven.

737
01:05:55.533 --> 01:05:57.660
Amelia had no son.

738
01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.997
Well, she had the foresight...

739
01:06:01.164 --> 01:06:03.500
to know that my claim
would be challenged.


740
01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:06.169
For the council.

741
01:06:22.393 --> 01:06:23.770
Amelia.

742
01:06:37.826 --> 01:06:39.577
His claim is true.

743
01:06:40.703 --> 01:06:43.998
David is the last of the purebloods.

744
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.503
Irrelevant.
You are outnumbered and outgunned.


745
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:50.839
Varga, your orders still remain.
Kill him.


746
01:06:55.093 --> 01:06:57.971
- I said, "Kill him."
- No.


747
01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:03.434
You swore to serve me.

748
01:07:03.601 --> 01:07:05.770
I swore to protect
the leader of this house.


749
01:07:06.396 --> 01:07:07.564
<i>Breach detected.</i>

750
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:10.400
<i>- Security system engaged.</i>
- Lycans. They're here.


751
01:07:10.567 --> 01:07:13.319
Lock her away until she can be judged
by the council.


752
01:07:13.903 --> 01:07:17.073
<i>Security system engaged.
Breach detected. Security system...</i>


753
01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:22.454
- She gets her damn war after all.
- Varga, you can still be forgiven.


754
01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:23.830
Gag her as well.

755
01:07:52.317 --> 01:07:54.068
Come on, move that truck. Move it.

756
01:08:00.992 --> 01:08:02.535
Watch your angles!

757
01:08:04.454 --> 01:08:05.455
Let's go!

758
01:08:29.312 --> 01:08:30.438
Hold your positions.

759
01:09:12.188 --> 01:09:14.858
- On the staircase!
- Behind you!


760
01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:21.823
- Fall back!
- Retreat!


761
01:09:36.379 --> 01:09:37.422
Behind the balustrades!

762
01:09:37.922 --> 01:09:39.466
Take them out!

763
01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:54.647
- Come on!
- Move, move, move!


764
01:09:56.483 --> 01:09:57.525
Move it!

765
01:10:05.825 --> 01:10:07.452
Fuck.

766
01:10:09.078 --> 01:10:10.997
Aim at the ready!

767
01:10:13.124 --> 01:10:14.626
Fire!

768
01:10:41.694 --> 01:10:43.112
Fire!

769
01:10:59.129 --> 01:11:01.214
Hide from the light!

770
01:11:06.386 --> 01:11:08.263
Run!

771
01:11:08.429 --> 01:11:09.764
Move!

772
01:11:12.475 --> 01:11:13.476
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

773
01:12:43.107 --> 01:12:44.692
Impossible.

774
01:12:44.859 --> 01:12:45.860
I saw you dead.

775
01:12:46.486 --> 01:12:47.487
I'm here.

776
01:12:47.654 --> 01:12:49.197
I brought backup.

777
01:12:57.497 --> 01:12:58.581
There are too many of them.

778
01:14:21.706 --> 01:14:22.874
I've already killed you.

779
01:14:31.299 --> 01:14:32.467
Marius!

780
01:16:18.823 --> 01:16:20.325
- Marius.
<i>- Please.</i>


781
01:17:04.452 --> 01:17:06.454
I wish your father
was alive to see this.


782
01:17:08.248 --> 01:17:10.416
His ridiculous dream
of you ruling this coven...


783
01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:12.418
will be the very thing that kills you.

784
01:17:18.091 --> 01:17:19.592
Missed.

785
01:17:28.184 --> 01:17:30.937
Oh, it worked.

786
01:18:00.258 --> 01:18:01.342
I'm one of you.

787
01:18:01.759 --> 01:18:03.678
No! No! No!

788
01:18:17.275 --> 01:18:18.860
You killed Michael.

789
01:18:22.822 --> 01:18:24.157
This is the last of him.

790
01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:12.622
<i>You're family,
and you're all I have left.</i>


791
01:19:12.789 --> 01:19:13.957
<i>Do you not know who I am?</i>

792
01:20:26.946 --> 01:20:28.239
Your leader is dead.

793
01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:34.287
Take your wounded. Leave.

794
01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:37.415
Leave!

795
01:20:44.297 --> 01:20:47.383
<i>We fought our greatest battle
in our darkest hour.</i>


796
01:20:48.384 --> 01:20:51.930
<i>After centuries of war
between vampire and Lycan...</i>


797
01:20:52.096 --> 01:20:55.058
<i>this may at last
be a time of peace.</i>

798
01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:58.937
<i>We must once again
tend to our wounded...</i>


799
01:20:59.103 --> 01:21:00.563
<i>honor our fallen.</i>

800
01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:04.150
<i>Our final two covens
must find strength and unity...</i>


801
01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:07.111
<i>to heal and rise from the ashes.</i>

802
01:21:13.785 --> 01:21:15.954
<i>My journey has now come full circle.</i>

803
01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:20.375
<i>Once an outcast, I am now one
of three chosen Elders.</i>


804
01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.710
<i>From hunted to the highest honor.</i>

805
01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:50.655
<i>I have lived 1000 years.</i>

806
01:21:50.822 --> 01:21:53.241
<i>I may live 1000 more...</i>

807
01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:55.743
<i>or I may die tomorrow.</i>

808
01:21:58.329 --> 01:22:00.582
<i>But I no longer fear death...</i>

809
01:22:00.748 --> 01:22:03.668
<i>for I have known it once already.</i>

810
01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:08.006
<i>I am reborn...</i>

811
01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:11.134
<i>and my eyes have been opened
to the Sacred World...</i>


812
01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:14.137
<i>and to the promise
of what is yet to be.</i>


813
01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.975
<i>There is no beginning.</i>

814
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:21.269
<i>There is no end.</i>

815
01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:24.814
<i>There is only becoming.</i>
