- Hello?

00:03:09.686 --> 00:03:13.657
(TV chatters faintly)

32
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.632
Hello?

33
00:03:25.435 --> 00:03:29.140
(TV chatters faintly)

34
00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:32.642

(ominous music continues)

44
00:04:53.424 --> 00:04:54.759
- Oh, shit!
- Oh!


45
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.596
- Scared the, scared
the shit out of me.


46
00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:05.602
I wasn't expecting
you till seven.


47
00:05:05.635 --> 00:05:08.272
- Yeah. Sorry, I
didn't wanna be late.


48
00:05:10.307 --> 00:05:11.541
- It's Gwen, right?

49
00:05:11.574 --> 00:05:13.377
- Yeah. Gwen Taylor.

50
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:15.578
- Right. Teddy.

51
00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:17.882
Teddy Miles. This is my place.

52
00:05:19.817 --> 00:05:23.154
I appreciate you saving my
ass on such short notice.


53
00:05:23.187 --> 00:05:24.621
- Yeah, of course.

54
00:05:26.157 --> 00:05:27.158
- Yeah.

55
00:05:32.196 --> 00:05:36.067
(TV chatters faintly)

56
00:05:40.838 --> 00:05:43.808
- I noticed the window in
one of the rooms was open.


57
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:46.744
Cabin 18, the wind was
blowing at the door.


58
00:05:47.978 --> 00:05:51.816
- Maybe you think you should
get a new quarterback. Geez.


59
00:05:55.618 --> 00:06:00.590
So you just moved
to the area, or?


60
00:06:00.623 --> 00:06:02.692
- Mm-hmm. From Ashford.

61
00:06:02.725 --> 00:06:05.229
It's not too far.

62
00:06:05.262 --> 00:06:07.697
- By yourself, or you
got family around here?


63
00:06:08.466 --> 00:06:10.935
- No, I'm on my own.

64
00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:12.870
- Oh.

65
00:06:14.738 --> 00:06:17.674
- You said on the phone
that this was a cash job?


66
00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:20.610
- Yes. Straight in your pocket.

67
00:06:20.643 --> 00:06:22.880
Yeah, I mean, hell, if
you take to the job,


68
00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:27.084
then maybe we could make it
a regular thing, you know?


69
00:06:27.118 --> 00:06:28.119
- Really?

70
00:06:29.553 --> 00:06:30.888
Wow, that'd be great.

71
00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:33.858
- Carmen usually works nights,

72
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.595
but her kid's been
getting pretty sick.


73
00:06:37.627 --> 00:06:39.997
- Oh. Yeah, that's terrible.

74
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.798
- Yeah.

75
00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:43.167
I would normally
work the double,


76
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.339
but I just have this
thing that I can't miss.


77
00:06:48.372 --> 00:06:52.343
It is with a girl, so.

78
00:06:52.376 --> 00:06:54.578
(head thumps)
(Gwen gasps)


79
00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:56.413
- Fucking Yogi, don't
do this to me.


80
00:06:56.447 --> 00:07:01.218
Sorry, that's Yogi.
Yogi, come on.


81
00:07:01.252 --> 00:07:02.319
Why would you do this today?

82
00:07:02.353 --> 00:07:03.454
- [Gwen] Oh, here.

83
00:07:03.487 --> 00:07:04.588
- Oh. Hey, thank you.

84
00:07:04.622 --> 00:07:06.023
(both grunting)

85
00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:09.360
Really gotta get this
thing fixed. Oh my.


86
00:07:09.393 --> 00:07:12.263
Oh, heavy. Oh, let's see.

87
00:07:18.802 --> 00:07:20.237
Look, I know it looks as

88
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:22.806
if the damn Addams family
used to live here,


89
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.308
but trust me, they,
they did not.


90
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:27.278
They never lived here.
This place is harmless.


91
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:30.814
It actually belonged to my
grandfolks way back when,


92
00:07:30.848 --> 00:07:34.752
but we haven't quite
updated it since, so.


93
00:07:36.587 --> 00:07:39.590
You know, I got, like,

94
00:07:39.623 --> 00:07:41.892
crazy, crazy plans
for this place.


95
00:07:41.926 --> 00:07:44.328
I'm talking some big-ass
plans for this place.


96
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:49.333
I'm just waiting on a
loan approval. Right?


97
00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:52.069
And then as soon as that
comes in, I'm going to,


98
00:07:53.771 --> 00:07:56.706
I'm gonna remodel
Miles Ahead Motel.


99
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.841
What you think?

100
00:07:57.875 --> 00:07:59.743
(playful music)

101
00:07:59.777 --> 00:08:01.478
- Looks good.

102
00:08:01.512 --> 00:08:02.712
- Yeah, it could
be pretty sweet.


103
00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:04.515
It's already got
five stars built in,


104
00:08:04.548 --> 00:08:07.218
so that's covered. (laughs)

105
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:09.887
And hell, who knows?
You know, if business booms,


106
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.323
then maybe get a
franchise out of it.


107
00:08:12.356 --> 00:08:15.326
Like, that'll be, yeah. Yeah.

108
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:19.029
Let me give you the tour.

109
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.469
(ominous music)

110
00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.411
And we don't get that many
guests this time of year,


111
00:08:34.445 --> 00:08:35.679
truth be told.

112
00:08:35.713 --> 00:08:37.881
Mostly folks just passing
through to Denning.


113
00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:40.985
(swings creaking)

114
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.822
Now, we got 20 cabins.

115
00:08:44.855 --> 00:08:46.924
All are basically identical.

116
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.763
Okay, so queen bed,

117
00:08:52.796 --> 00:08:55.766
mini fridge, phone.

118
00:08:56.367 --> 00:08:57.234
You know, it's not much,

119
00:08:57.268 --> 00:09:00.070
but it's a place
to rest your head.


120
00:09:00.104 --> 00:09:03.974
And standard-definition
television.


121
00:09:06.877 --> 00:09:09.713
Okay. Let's see.

122
00:09:09.748 --> 00:09:13.550
Shower, toilet, all
pretty much standard.


123
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.859
(ominous music)

124
00:09:21.892 --> 00:09:23.794
(Gwen scoffs)

125
00:09:25.764 --> 00:09:27.865
So, already cleaned cabin 12,

126
00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:30.467
but eight still
needs some doing.


127
00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:32.436
- Okay, cabin eight. Got it.

128
00:09:32.469 --> 00:09:35.506
- Right. You need me to
show you the ropes, or?


129
00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:37.041
- I think I can handle it.

130
00:09:37.074 --> 00:09:41.746
I did notice, however, that
you don't do a French fold.


131
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.981
- A French what? (laughs)

132
00:09:44.014 --> 00:09:46.717
(gentle whimsical music)

133
00:09:46.751 --> 00:09:48.919
- If we drape the banding back,

134
00:09:48.952 --> 00:09:51.121
the finished side
will be exposed.


135
00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:53.924
Not only will the bed
look more comfortable,


136
00:09:53.957 --> 00:09:57.094
but the guests will feel the
softness when they climb in.


137
00:09:57.127 --> 00:09:59.063
- Well, shit, now I want
to jump in that thing.


138
00:09:59.096 --> 00:10:00.998
I wanna take a nap right now.

139
00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:04.468
- Yeah. My mom used
to work in motels.


140
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:07.204
I used to help her out
after school sometimes.


141
00:10:12.076 --> 00:10:14.945
- Okay, here we have
the supply room.


142
00:10:14.978 --> 00:10:18.482
Oh, don't forget
to use this brick.


143
00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:20.884
Now, the door only
opens from the outside,


144
00:10:20.918 --> 00:10:23.053
and this brick will keep
you from getting locked in.


145
00:10:23.087 --> 00:10:25.122
It is very, very important.

146
00:10:25.989 --> 00:10:27.891
(Teddy groans)

147
00:10:29.927 --> 00:10:36.367
Okay. So linens are kept
up here, towels down below.


148
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.204
More cleaning supplies above
the washer-dryer combo.


149
00:10:41.205 --> 00:10:45.209
Fuse box right over
here. What else?


150
00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:52.383
Just give me a second, okay?

151
00:10:52.983 --> 00:10:55.185
(crickets chirping)

152
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.392
(ominous music)

153
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.437
(ominous music continues)

154
00:11:22.747 --> 00:11:26.350
(ominous music continues)

155
00:11:35.726 --> 00:11:39.329
(ominous music continues)

156
00:11:48.572 --> 00:11:52.676
(ominous music continues)

157
00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:56.213
Sinkhole last summer.

158
00:11:56.246 --> 00:11:57.448
Been on the phone
with the county


159
00:11:57.481 --> 00:11:59.851
for months trying to
get them to close it.


160
00:11:59.884 --> 00:12:02.252
Assholes are finally
coming this weekend.


161
00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:05.322
- I've never seen one before.

162
00:12:05.355 --> 00:12:08.559
- Yeah. Sucked all the
water in the damn ground.


163
00:12:10.227 --> 00:12:12.062
Luckily, nobody
was swimming in it.


164
00:12:12.095 --> 00:12:15.032
(ominous music)

165
00:12:25.342 --> 00:12:30.581
- Teddy, how come
cabin 13 is only 45.50?


166
00:12:30.614 --> 00:12:33.550
That's half the price
of the other rooms.


167
00:12:33.584 --> 00:12:36.286
- Oh, superstition.

168
00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:38.155
- You can't be serious.

169
00:12:38.188 --> 00:12:39.757
- It's the same reason
why flights are cheaper


170
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:40.959
on Friday the 13th,

171
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:44.094
or animal shelters are
overrun with black cats.


172
00:12:44.127 --> 00:12:47.030
People are fucking stupid.
They will believe anything.


173
00:12:47.064 --> 00:12:48.265
Have you eaten?

174
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.034
- Not yet.

175
00:12:51.068 --> 00:12:53.704
- Well, Postmates don't
come out this far,


176
00:12:53.738 --> 00:12:56.106
and the wifi is a little janky,

177
00:12:56.139 --> 00:12:59.042
but if you're in the
mood for some killer pho.


178
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.312
- It's pho-king delicious.

179
00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:05.048
- Yeah, it's the best
Vietnamese in town.


180
00:13:05.082 --> 00:13:07.752
It's the only Vietnamese
in town. Yeah.


181
00:13:09.152 --> 00:13:12.389
So, I do believe that is,
that's everything.


182
00:13:18.028 --> 00:13:19.229
- I have to ask.

183
00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:24.134
What kind of security
do you have here?


184
00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:25.803
(ominous music)

185
00:13:25.837 --> 00:13:26.871
- Security?

186
00:13:26.905 --> 00:13:29.706
Oh, we have, I mean,

187
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:31.508
we have a monitor on the desk.

188
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.280
- Oh. I mean, protection.

189
00:13:36.313 --> 00:13:42.085
This hotel is a ways out, and
I'm a woman alone at night.


190
00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:44.354
What if I get some
asshole guest?


191
00:13:45.422 --> 00:13:48.458
- Oh, just call the police.

192
00:13:48.492 --> 00:13:51.395
- Yeah and wait, what, 30
minutes if they even show?


193
00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:53.397
- Well, if you want,

194
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.033
there's a fire ax next
to the vending machine.


195
00:13:55.065 --> 00:13:56.166
Nobody's gonna mess with you

196
00:13:56.199 --> 00:13:57.200
if you swinging that
thing around,


197
00:13:57.234 --> 00:13:58.569
you know what I'm saying?

198
00:13:58.602 --> 00:14:00.838
They might call the
police on you, so.


199
00:14:04.474 --> 00:14:05.475
Okay, Gwen.

200
00:14:07.077 --> 00:14:08.612
Relax, okay?

201
00:14:08.645 --> 00:14:11.749
I know it seems a little
spooky, but trust me,


202
00:14:11.783 --> 00:14:13.183
I haven't had any trouble here,

203
00:14:13.216 --> 00:14:15.085
and neither has Carmen.

204
00:14:15.118 --> 00:14:16.320
But I tell you what,

205
00:14:16.353 --> 00:14:19.791
if you feel unsafe or
threatened in any way,


206
00:14:19.824 --> 00:14:21.491
there's a deadbolt
in the parlor.


207
00:14:21.525 --> 00:14:24.161
Just lock yourself
in there and then,


208
00:14:24.194 --> 00:14:27.331
you know, just call me, okay?

209
00:14:27.765 --> 00:14:28.632
(Gwen sighs)

210
00:14:28.665 --> 00:14:31.803
Trust me, Gwen,
you're gonna be fine.


211
00:14:34.772 --> 00:14:37.641
(rats scuttering)

212
00:14:41.178 --> 00:14:44.214
- Is that rats?

213
00:14:45.115 --> 00:14:46.550
- Hmm.

214
00:14:47.986 --> 00:14:49.586
Tell me that's not rats.

215
00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:52.824
- Oh, no, that's not rats.

216
00:14:54.725 --> 00:14:57.962
(rats scuttering)

217
00:14:57.996 --> 00:15:00.965
Okay, that's rats. That is rats.

218
00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:02.532
Okay, I'll tell you what.

219
00:15:03.367 --> 00:15:06.603
Pho is on me, okay?

220
00:15:06.637 --> 00:15:09.673
(gentle whimsical music)

221
00:15:09.706 --> 00:15:12.910
You ain't gonna eat that much
pho, so I'll just take this.


222
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:18.482
Whew, it's chilly tonight.

223
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.653
Okay, Gwen, I will see
you in the morning.


224
00:15:22.686 --> 00:15:24.221
7:00 A.M. okay?

225
00:15:26.723 --> 00:15:29.794
And Gwen, welcome
to the night shift.

My name is Gwen. I just
started the night shift.


238
00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:53.978
I'm taking over for
Mr. Miles, the manager.


239
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.786
You're just staying the
one night, is that correct?


240
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:05.790
(door opening)

241
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:12.797
Hi. I just wanted to make
sure you were all right.


242
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:16.000
Do you need anything?
Fresh towels, perhaps?


243
00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:18.870
- No.

244
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.471
- Okay.

245
00:17:23.607 --> 00:17:26.309
Well, if you change your
mind, just give me a call.


246
00:17:26.343 --> 00:17:28.545
I'll be in the office
most of the night.

00:26:37.594 --> 00:26:41.198
(ominous music continues)

330
00:26:43.133 --> 00:26:45.502
(creaking)

331
00:26:53.644 --> 00:26:54.678
(phone ringing)

332
00:26:54.712 --> 00:26:57.314
(ominous music)

333
00:27:09.293 --> 00:27:13.030
(phone ringing continues)
(ominous music continues)


334
00:27:24.608 --> 00:27:27.611
(phone ringing continues)

335
00:27:28.712 --> 00:27:29.713
- It's for you.

336
00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:32.516
(Gwen screams)

337
00:27:36.387 --> 00:27:39.123
(phone ringing)

338
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.025
(Gwen panting)

339
00:27:47.364 --> 00:27:48.365
- Excuse me.

340
00:27:51.635 --> 00:27:53.437
This is broken. Are you okay?

341
00:27:54.438 --> 00:27:56.006
(Gwen pants)

342
00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:58.242
Are you okay?

343
00:28:00.644 --> 00:28:03.380
(ominous music)

344
00:28:11.422 --> 00:28:13.957
- There's gotta be
one in here somewhere.


345
00:28:15.325 --> 00:28:18.162
You have to excuse me. It's
my first night working here.


346
00:28:18.195 --> 00:28:19.496
- Oh, no, that's fine.

347
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.633
You said your name
was Gwen, right?


348
00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:23.667
- Mm-hmm.

349
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.068
- Well, I'm Alice.

350
00:28:33.243 --> 00:28:34.678
What did you see in there?

351
00:28:36.246 --> 00:28:37.247
- What?

352
00:28:37.281 --> 00:28:40.117
- In the cabin. Number 13.

353
00:28:41.552 --> 00:28:47.191
- Oh. Yeah, I've barely
slept in nearly 20 hours.


354
00:28:47.224 --> 00:28:49.993
I literally just moved
here and started this job,


355
00:28:50.027 --> 00:28:53.130
and my mind is pretty
scattered right now.


356
00:28:53.163 --> 00:28:54.965
And with this place
looking the way it does,


357
00:28:54.998 --> 00:28:57.701
the taxidermy and the old pipes,

358
00:28:57.735 --> 00:28:58.969
I, um...

359
00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:05.976
I thought I was hearing
things, seeing things.


360
00:29:07.244 --> 00:29:10.882
- That's a shame. I do
love a good ghost story.


361
00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:14.485
Listen, I hope I didn't
come off as rude earlier


362
00:29:14.518 --> 00:29:15.285
when you knocked.

363
00:29:15.319 --> 00:29:17.856
I was a little upset.
- Yes!


364
00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:19.824
Found one.
- Oh, great. Thanks.


365
00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.425
- No, no, no!

366
00:29:22.092 --> 00:29:25.529
Oh, shit. It's locked.

367
00:29:25.562 --> 00:29:28.265
- Wait, what? Don't you
have a key or something?


368
00:29:28.298 --> 00:29:29.533
- No.

369
00:29:31.034 --> 00:29:33.604
It can only open up
from the outside.


370
00:29:35.005 --> 00:29:36.273
We're stuck.

371
00:29:38.709 --> 00:29:41.980
- Hey! Help us!

372
00:29:42.012 --> 00:29:43.380
Someone help us!
We're locked in here!


373
00:29:43.413 --> 00:29:44.916
Let us out!
- No one else is staying


374
00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:47.584
at the motel, no
one can hear us.


375
00:29:47.618 --> 00:29:48.786
- Fuck.

376
00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:51.455
- Wait, do you have
your phone on you?


377
00:29:51.488 --> 00:29:53.423
- No. That's why I
needed the dryer.


378
00:29:53.457 --> 00:29:56.393
It fell in the fucking sink
when I was dyeing my hair.


379
00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:00.130
What time does your
manager come back?


380
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:02.332
- 7:00 A.M.

381
00:30:08.071 --> 00:30:10.040
(ominous music)

382
00:30:10.073 --> 00:30:12.042
- [Alice] Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.


383
00:30:12.075 --> 00:30:14.578
- [Gwen] Hey, hey,
hey! It's okay.


384
00:30:14.611 --> 00:30:16.647
- No, I'm claustrophobic.

385
00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:20.250
- Okay. Just, just calm down.

386
00:30:21.084 --> 00:30:22.319
Just breathe.

387
00:30:22.352 --> 00:30:23.387
- [Alice] No. Ah, what is that?

388
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.789
There's somebody else in here.

389
00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:26.123
- [Gwen] There's nobody in here.

390
00:30:26.156 --> 00:30:27.658
- [Alice] No, no, no. There's
somebody else in here.


391
00:30:27.691 --> 00:30:28.625
I felt something thing.

392
00:30:28.659 --> 00:30:31.628
(ominous music)

393
00:30:31.662 --> 00:30:34.264
(tense music)

394
00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:38.368
(Alice yelping)

395
00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:42.706
- Okay, stay behind me.

396
00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:47.711
(Alice screams)

397
00:30:47.745 --> 00:30:48.947
- You all order the pho?

398
00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.048
- Hey, let us out of here!

399
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.015
- What?

400
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:52.416
- [Gwen] Open the fucking door.

401
00:30:55.719 --> 00:30:58.522
(Alice and Gwen panting)

402
00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:02.159
- Ah, shit.

403
00:31:04.728 --> 00:31:06.064
- What?

404
00:31:06.096 --> 00:31:07.698
- I got you the wrong order.

405
00:31:12.235 --> 00:31:14.072
- Mm. What was this one?

406
00:31:14.104 --> 00:31:15.405
Pork?

407
00:31:15.439 --> 00:31:18.241
- I don't know what it
is, but it's delicious.


408
00:31:19.276 --> 00:31:21.211
- Thank you, for the food.

409
00:31:21.244 --> 00:31:22.212
- Are you kidding?

410
00:31:22.245 --> 00:31:23.614
Mr. Miles paid, and he owes us

411
00:31:23.647 --> 00:31:24.849
after the shit we just
went through.


412
00:31:24.882 --> 00:31:26.050
(Alice laughs)

413
00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:27.952
How he has managed to
keep this place open,


414
00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:29.686
I will never know.

415
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.254
- Hmm.
(Gwen chuckles)


416
00:31:33.657 --> 00:31:34.691
- So why red?

417
00:31:37.594 --> 00:31:38.729
- Uh...

418
00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:42.532
It's my mom. She never
lets me do anything.


419
00:31:42.566 --> 00:31:46.370
Dye my hair, go to parties,
watch horror movies.


420
00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:51.375
We got in this big
argument. I left.


421
00:31:52.242 --> 00:31:53.878
Doesn't really know where I am.

422
00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:56.446
- You ran away from home.

423
00:31:57.381 --> 00:31:58.883
- Well, I'm not going back.

424
00:32:00.317 --> 00:32:02.519
- Where's home, your mom?

425
00:32:03.487 --> 00:32:04.488
- Umm...

426
00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:05.857
Denning.

427
00:32:06.824 --> 00:32:08.725
Yeah. No, it's a shithole.

428
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.362
Yeah, it's so boring.

429
00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.266
- Alice, I know you
don't want to hear this,


430
00:32:16.299 --> 00:32:18.201
but your mom is just
trying to look out for you.


431
00:32:18.235 --> 00:32:20.337
- Oh.
- She must be worried sick.


432
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.140
- No, no, no, no.
You don't know her.


433
00:32:22.172 --> 00:32:23.540
She's a bitch.

434
00:32:23.573 --> 00:32:25.208
One time, Hobie Kittredge
gave me a hickey,


435
00:32:25.242 --> 00:32:27.611
and she like, grounded
me for a month.


436
00:32:27.644 --> 00:32:29.279
(Gwen scoffs)

437
00:32:29.312 --> 00:32:31.515
- Yeah, my mom was the same way.

438
00:32:31.548 --> 00:32:35.318
She was tough as hell
on me, super strict.


439
00:32:35.352 --> 00:32:38.689
My younger sisters, they got
away with it, but not me.


440
00:32:41.224 --> 00:32:42.726
But family matters.

441
00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:49.133
Listen, Alice,

442
00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:50.300
(ominous music)

443
00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:53.838
it's dangerous to be
on the road by yourself.


444
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.807
The world can be a scary place.

445
00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:59.811
There are bad people out
there doing bad things.


446
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:09.286
Anyway, I just think
you should reconsider


447
00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:11.388
what you're doing.
That's all.


448
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.860
My mom, she passed
away a while ago,


449
00:33:15.893 --> 00:33:17.227
but I still miss her.

450
00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:23.768
- Yeah, think, she's probably
trying to reach me now.


451
00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:34.478
- Do you want a Coke?

452
00:33:34.511 --> 00:33:36.480
(Alice chuckles)
- Fuck yeah.


453
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.722
(engine roaring)

454
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.665
(ominous music)

455
00:34:04.809 --> 00:34:08.411
(ominous music continues)

456
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.592
(ominous music continues)

457
00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:34.739
(ominous music continues)

458
00:34:34.772 --> 00:34:36.606
(door slams)

459
00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:47.785
(ominous music continues)

460
00:34:50.487 --> 00:34:52.355
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus.


461
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:53.291
- Sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.


462
00:34:53.323 --> 00:34:54.491
- No, it's okay.

463
00:34:54.524 --> 00:34:58.262
Sorry, I'm just a little
spooked from the rats.


464
00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.764
- Oh, yeah. Here, no,
let me help you out.


465
00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:00.998
- It's okay. Don't worry.
- No, it's okay.


466
00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:02.166
It's really no bother.
- It's okay. It's fine.


467
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.400
I said I got it.

468
00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:07.772
I don't want you
to cut yourself.


469
00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:14.678
- Well, thank you
for dinner again.


470
00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.915
I'm gonna go and try
this out on my phone.


471
00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:21.052
See if I can get it to work.

472
00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:23.420
- Yeah, good idea.

473
00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:30.594
(door creaking)

474
00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:35.900
Alice.

475
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:43.107
Don't forget to lock
your door, okay?


476
00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:46.210
- Yeah, always.

477
00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:48.980
(ominous music)

478
00:35:57.955 --> 00:36:01.558
(ominous music continues)

479
00:36:04.728 --> 00:36:07.031
(bell dings)

480
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.872
(door thuds)

481
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.715
(ominous music)

482
00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:28.853
(head thuds)

483
00:36:28.886 --> 00:36:29.887
- Fuck.

484
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.792
Goddammit, Yogi.

485
00:36:36.327 --> 00:36:39.562
(gentle whimsical music)
(Gwen groaning)


486
00:36:42.432 --> 00:36:43.533
What the fuck.

487
00:36:43.566 --> 00:36:47.071
(gentle whimsical music)
(Gwen groaning)


488
00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:53.144
(Gwen breathing heavily)

489
00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:56.080
(engine roaring)

490
00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:58.849
(ominous music)

491
00:37:01.584 --> 00:37:04.688
(door creaking and closing)

492
00:37:07.624 --> 00:37:11.228
(ominous music continues)

493
00:37:20.704 --> 00:37:26.077
- [Birdie] Jesus Christ. Warn,
look at this dump! (laughs)


494
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:28.645
- Welcome to The All Tucked
Inn, how may I help you?


495
00:37:28.678 --> 00:37:32.316
- Dead birds. Dead
fucking birds.


496
00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:33.616
I told you, didn't I say so?

497
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:37.989
- You totally did.
(gasps) Oh my God.


498
00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:41.392
- Ma'am. Ma'am, please
don't touch that.


499
00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:43.227
- She can touch
whatever she wants.


500
00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:49.934
Hi. Now, we would like
your very best room.


501
00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:52.837
(bell dinging)

502
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.872
We just escaped
a gallery showing


503
00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:58.009
that was absolutely
fucking rudimentary,


504
00:37:58.042 --> 00:37:59.844
and we want to still
enjoy ourselves


505
00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:02.213
so this night is
not a total waste.


506
00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:03.748
- My idea, of course.

507
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.615
Let's stop in a seedy
motel just like they do


508
00:38:05.648 --> 00:38:07.018
in the movies!

509
00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:08.085
(Warner and Birdie laugh)

510
00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:10.855
- Sure. How long would
you like to stay?


511
00:38:10.888 --> 00:38:14.258
- I guess, I don't know.
We'll stay for the full hour.


512
00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:15.625
- You'll only need 10 minutes.

513
00:38:15.658 --> 00:38:17.495
- Birdie, play nice.

514
00:38:17.527 --> 00:38:19.897
(Birdie growls)
(Warner scowls)


515
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:22.867
- Sir, this isn't that
kind of establishment.


516
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.534
We don't rent rooms by the hour.

517
00:38:24.567 --> 00:38:25.770
But if you'd like,

518
00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.738
I could book you into
a cabin for the night.


519
00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:32.743
- Oh my God. Wait, are
you fucking kidding me?


520
00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.178
Don't...

521
00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:37.580
Don't tell me people actually
sleep in this shithole.


522
00:38:40.683 --> 00:38:44.789
- It's a nightly charge,
sir. 91 even per room.


523
00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:46.991
- Oh my God, we have
the cash, Warn.


524
00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:48.359
Just pay the girl.

525
00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:50.627
- It's not about
the money, Birdie.


526
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.663
So are you really telling me

527
00:38:53.696 --> 00:38:57.301
that you will not rent
us a room for an hour?


528
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.139
- I can't. It's against policy.

529
00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:04.674
- My God. Shit.

530
00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:11.415
How does this fucking
dump even stay open? God.


531
00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:13.751
What kind of salary do they
even have you on here, huh?


532
00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:16.053
- Easy, Warn. Come on.

533
00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:20.157
- Look at her. Hey,
mm-mm, look at her.


534
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.192
Look at my wife.

535
00:39:22.659 --> 00:39:26.564
She is a fucking goddess.

536
00:39:26.596 --> 00:39:31.268
Do you think I would
ever let her sleep


537
00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:33.737
in this disease-ridden pigsty?

538
00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:37.541
Hmm? This shit
stain for a motel?


539
00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:41.711
I mean, people have
probably died here, right?


540
00:39:41.745 --> 00:39:42.947
Been murdered.

541
00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:49.719
- Like I said, it's

542
00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:55.960
- Fine, just say what you
want. What do you want?


543
00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.862
Do you want 100? There's 100.

544
00:39:57.895 --> 00:40:00.564
Fine. You know what, why
don't you just take 200.


545
00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:02.133
- Like I said, it's just $91.

546
00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:03.501
- [Warner] Why don't
you take 300, right?


547
00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:06.337
350, 4, huh? 400.

548
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.605
- Sir, please stop.

549
00:40:07.637 --> 00:40:12.009
- Jesus Christ! Just give
me my fucking room key.


550
00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:14.778
(ominous music)

551
00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:24.155
- Room two.

552
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.225
Would you like me to
show you where it is?


553
00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.894
(Warner groans)

554
00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:32.229
- Let me guess, it's
between one and three.


555
00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:37.667
Then I think we'll
manage, won't we?


556
00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:41.505
- [Birdie] Warn.
- [Warner] What, baby?


557
00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:44.008
- I got glass in my Prada.

558
00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.109
- Oh.

559
00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:49.780
- Fuck. There's shards of
glass all over the floor.


560
00:40:49.813 --> 00:40:51.081
- All right, come on, come
on, come on. Let's go, baby.


561
00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:53.350
Here we go. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.


562
00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:54.585
(Birdie laughs)

563
00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:57.888
- Sorry, I just, I need you
to sign the registration book.


564
00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:02.426
- Yeah, well, fuck you
and your stupid book.


565
00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:05.829
(Warner and Birdie laugh)

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.137

(whip cracking)

579
00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:17.368
Oh. Ow!

580
00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:20.537
Ow.

581
00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:23.440
(whip cracking)
Ow.


582
00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.143
Shit.

583
00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:33.117

584
00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:45.429

00:42:53.937 --> 00:42:57.241
(ominous music)

586
00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:58.743
- Gross.

587
00:42:58.777 --> 00:43:01.979
(crickets chirping)

588
00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:14.291

604
00:45:26.925 --> 00:45:29.226
(Gwen continues screaming)

605
00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:31.896
Help, help me! Help me!

606
00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:33.564
- [Alice] Here! Gwen, here!

607
00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:36.433
(sinister music)

608
00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.739
- Gwen? What is it?
What's wrong?


609
00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:46.477
(Gwen gasping)

610
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:47.511
Gwen.

611
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:56.119
Okay. What'll it be?

612
00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:58.722
Russia, Ireland, or Jamaica?

613
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.124
- Whatever's strongest.

614
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.065
Thanks.

615
00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:09.299
- Nostrovia.

616
00:46:12.837 --> 00:46:14.037
Oh.

617
00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:20.711
You saw something
again, didn't you?


618
00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:24.181
In the pool. What'd you see?

619
00:46:25.917 --> 00:46:27.651
What'd you see?

620
00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:30.487
- I...

621
00:46:32.757 --> 00:46:33.858
I--

622
00:46:33.892 --> 00:46:35.692
- You know this place
is haunted, right?


623
00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:38.629
- What?

624
00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:40.798
- Yeah, it's like,

625
00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:44.234
one of the most haunted
locations in the state.


626
00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:48.472
It's actually like, part of
the reason why I came here.


627
00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:50.440
It's notorious, really.

628
00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:52.209
I heard like, a
shit ton of stories.


629
00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:55.679
I just wanted see if they
were true, you know.


630
00:46:57.015 --> 00:46:59.516
(Alice chuckles)

631
00:47:01.618 --> 00:47:03.620
(Gwen sighs)
Shit.


632
00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.622
- Jesus Christ.

633
00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:11.461
(Birdie and Warner laughing)

634
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:14.565
- [Birdie] Stop!

635
00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:18.770
- [Warner] All right,
hold on. (laughs)


636
00:47:18.803 --> 00:47:19.804
Oh.

637
00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:25.810
- Alice.

638
00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:28.712
- Yeah?

639
00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:33.818
- Have you seen a
strange car lurking


640
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:35.419
around the motel tonight?

641
00:47:36.955 --> 00:47:38.756
- Lurking. What do you mean?

642
00:47:44.227 --> 00:47:46.864
(somber music)

643
00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.569
Gwen, are you okay?

644
00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:55.305
(somber music)

645
00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:02.847
- When I was your age,

646
00:48:06.084 --> 00:48:11.288
a man named Walton
Grey, a loner,


647
00:48:12.824 --> 00:48:14.358
broke into our house.

648
00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:19.797
He killed my mom and my sisters,

649
00:48:20.865 --> 00:48:24.201
and he tried to kill me.

650
00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:30.407
I was the only
one that survived.


651
00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.441
- Jesus.

652
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:34.645
- They caught him,

653
00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:37.180
and they locked him
away in an institute,


654
00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:41.652
but two days ago, he escaped.

655
00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:44.287
- Are you serious?

656
00:48:47.825 --> 00:48:50.394
- I found this in my mailbox.

657
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:54.832
It's a necklace my mom gave me.

658
00:48:56.034 --> 00:48:59.436
It went missing the night
Walton Grey killed my family.


659
00:49:01.906 --> 00:49:04.675
I always believed
that he took it.


660
00:49:06.077 --> 00:49:07.277
- Holy shit.

661
00:49:08.946 --> 00:49:10.714
- I was so scared, Alice.

662
00:49:12.784 --> 00:49:16.888
I just, I left. I ran.

663
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.324
But he's followed me.

664
00:49:22.827 --> 00:49:24.095
I saw him.

665
00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:26.596
- What you've seen him? Tonight?

666
00:49:28.066 --> 00:49:30.835
- Twice, outside.

667
00:49:34.072 --> 00:49:36.841
- Gwen, are you sure it was him?

668
00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:39.944
Because you said you haven't
been sleeping a lot lately.


669
00:49:39.977 --> 00:49:43.748
- I don't know. I think so.

670
00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:47.752
I don't know what
I'm seeing here.


671
00:49:47.785 --> 00:49:52.090
This place is just
so fucking strange.


672
00:49:52.123 --> 00:49:54.391
- Yeah, yeah. No shit.

673
00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.930
Look, I think you
should call the police.


674
00:50:00.363 --> 00:50:02.834
You know, for your
own safety at least.


675
00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:09.573
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

676
00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:14.979
Alice, I need you to
do something for me.


677
00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:23.788
I want you to keep this
door locked, just in case,


678
00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:26.523
and I want you to stay
inside, all right?


679
00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:29.326
- Yeah, of course. You got it.

680
00:50:30.928 --> 00:50:31.929
Gwen?

681
00:50:33.765 --> 00:50:35.133
I, um...

682
00:50:35.166 --> 00:50:37.001
I thought about what you said,

683
00:50:37.034 --> 00:50:41.172
and I'm going home
in the morning,


684
00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:42.405
back to my mom's.

685
00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:45.743
Family matters, right?

686
00:50:51.149 --> 00:50:53.117
(door closes)
(lock clicks)


687
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:56.319
(crickets chirping)

688
00:51:04.796 --> 00:51:07.497
(ominous music)

689
00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:19.442
(ominous music continues)

690
00:51:19.476 --> 00:51:23.613
(door creaks and closes)

691
00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.420
- Hello?

692
00:51:32.156 --> 00:51:34.892
(ominous music)

693
00:51:43.234 --> 00:51:46.838
(ominous music continues)

694
00:51:55.913 --> 00:51:59.482
(ominous music continues)

695
00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:12.729
(ominous music continues)

696
00:52:21.806 --> 00:52:24.608
(ominous music)

697
00:52:26.476 --> 00:52:27.444
What the fuck.

698
00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:30.413
(ominous music)

699
00:52:39.991 --> 00:52:43.593
(ominous music continues)

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:56.439
(ominous music continues)

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.983

00:53:06.017 --> 00:53:09.619

(Gwen screams)

707
00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:45.823

00:54:04.842 --> 00:54:07.979
(tense sinister music continues)

712
00:54:08.879 --> 00:54:09.713
(upbeat music)

713
00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:12.482
♪ I know what's in my heart ♪

714
00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:16.686
(phone ringing)
(upbeat music continues)


715
00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.595
- Just met this bitch.

716
00:54:27.131 --> 00:54:29.200
Gwen, slow down.

717
00:54:29.233 --> 00:54:31.335
Okay. What happened?

718
00:54:31.369 --> 00:54:35.339
- You never told me this place
was fucking haunted, Teddy.


719
00:54:35.373 --> 00:54:36.907
- [Teddy] <i>What? Haunted?</i>

720
00:54:36.941 --> 00:54:38.976
- Don't play dumb
with me, asshole.


721
00:54:39.844 --> 00:54:40.945
I'm...

722
00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:43.881
I'm seeing things.

723
00:54:43.914 --> 00:54:45.950
Ghosts, Teddy.

724
00:54:45.983 --> 00:54:48.019
- Oh God, Gwen.

725
00:54:48.052 --> 00:54:51.222
<i>Okay. Is the place a</i>
<i>little fucking old?</i>


726
00:54:51.255 --> 00:54:54.291
I'll give you that. Is
the place a little spooky?


727
00:54:54.325 --> 00:54:55.760
Sure.
- A little?


728
00:54:55.793 --> 00:54:57.928
- Look Gwen, what I'm
trying to say is,


729
00:54:58.829 --> 00:55:00.865
Gwen, it's not haunted, okay?

730
00:55:00.898 --> 00:55:01.866
It's just not.

731
00:55:02.665 --> 00:55:07.038
- You're telling
me, swear to God,


732
00:55:07.071 --> 00:55:10.141
that you've never seen
anything at this motel.


733
00:55:10.174 --> 00:55:11.541
- No. Uh-uh.

734
00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:14.278
- Swear to God, Teddy,

735
00:55:15.212 --> 00:55:17.014
you've never seen anything?

736
00:55:17.048 --> 00:55:18.615
<i>
- Nothing, Gwen.</i>

737
00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:21.485
Nothing, I run a clean
ghost-free establishment.


738
00:55:21.519 --> 00:55:24.522
If there were ghosts,
I would know about it.


739
00:55:24.554 --> 00:55:26.689
Don't be ridiculous.

740
00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:28.325
- You're lying to me.

741
00:55:28.359 --> 00:55:29.592
- I'm not lying. I swear.

742
00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:30.795
<i>
- You know what,</i>

743
00:55:30.828 --> 00:55:32.430
this place is a fucking
horror show, Teddy.


744
00:55:32.463 --> 00:55:33.964
I should sue your ass.

745
00:55:33.998 --> 00:55:34.799
I got...

746
00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:37.735
I got fucking
ghosts, I got rats,


747
00:55:37.768 --> 00:55:41.172
I got a weird sex couple
wearing bird masks.


748
00:55:41.205 --> 00:55:43.441
- Okay, I don't know
nothing about no bird masks.


749
00:55:43.474 --> 00:55:45.543
- I'm not coming back.
Teddy, you hear me?


750
00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:46.944
This is my last goddamn shift.

751
00:55:46.977 --> 00:55:49.013
- Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, come on now.

752
00:55:49.046 --> 00:55:49.847
- I am done.

753
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.048
- Don't do that.
Don't do that, Gwen.


754
00:55:51.082 --> 00:55:51.949
- See your ass at seven.

755
00:55:51.982 --> 00:55:54.051
<i>
- Gwen, don't. 
Gwen, don't do--</i>

756
00:56:05.529 --> 00:56:08.432
(Gwen sighs)

757
00:56:08.466 --> 00:56:11.035
(bell dings)

00:56:11.068 --> 00:56:13.771

759
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.683
(ominous music continues)

760
00:56:30.788 --> 00:56:32.323
- [Visitor] Hello?

761
00:56:32.356 --> 00:56:35.059
(Gwen breathes deeply)

762
00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:37.461
(door creaks and closes)

763
00:56:37.495 --> 00:56:39.629
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

764
00:56:42.032 --> 00:56:43.167
I was--

765
00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:46.737
(ominous music)

766
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:49.206
- I'd like a room.

767
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.976
(ominous music)

768
00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:02.853
- How long would
you like to stay?


769
00:57:05.722 --> 00:57:10.660
- One night. Been a long drive.

770
00:57:10.693 --> 00:57:13.397
(ominous music)

771
00:57:20.738 --> 00:57:23.073
Don't I recognize
you from someplace?


772
00:57:27.344 --> 00:57:28.379
- I don't think so.

773
00:57:29.313 --> 00:57:35.152
- Hmm. You must have
one of those faces.


774
00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:40.457
- That's what people
keep telling me.


775
00:57:48.032 --> 00:57:50.167
It'll be 91 for the night.

776
00:57:52.636 --> 00:57:53.837
- Cheap.

777
00:57:57.741 --> 00:57:59.009
Really cheap.

778
00:58:02.446 --> 00:58:05.316
(visitor humming)

779
00:58:05.883 --> 00:58:09.453
(ominous music)

780
00:58:16.393 --> 00:58:17.394
Here.

781
00:58:18.629 --> 00:58:20.730
91.

782
00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:26.804
(ominous music)

783
00:58:34.111 --> 00:58:36.480

784
00:58:39.783 --> 00:58:42.019
(key rattles)

785
00:58:43.354 --> 00:58:44.788
Cabin 12?

786
00:58:53.163 --> 00:58:55.165
(ominous music)

787
00:58:55.199 --> 00:58:57.401
- Are you gonna
show me to my room?


788
00:59:02.373 --> 00:59:03.374
- Yes, certainly.

789
00:59:09.113 --> 00:59:13.817
Actually, why don't I put you

790
00:59:13.851 --> 00:59:15.819
in cabin eight?

791
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:22.793
It's just been freshly turned.

792
00:59:25.729 --> 00:59:28.098
- Sure. Sounds good.

793

(key rattles)

799
01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:24.054
- Here we are. Queen bed.

800
01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:27.124
There's a mini fridge.

801
01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.362
There's a phone
on the desk there.


802

(door slams)

803
01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:47.344
- I didn't catch your name.

804
01:00:50.749 --> 01:00:52.249
What did you say it was?

805
01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:02.526
- The towels.

806
01:01:02.559 --> 01:01:06.230
I just need to make sure
you have clean towels.

- Oh, fuck.

812
01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:57.381
Gwen, don't you know who I am?

813
01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:02.319
- You're Walton Grey.

814
01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:10.194
- My name is Raymond Bailey.

815
01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:13.397
I'm your doctor.

816
01:02:16.801 --> 01:02:18.135
- What?

817
01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:23.173
- You've been under my care

818
01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:27.711
at Ashford Psychiatric
Facility for 12 years.


819
01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:34.318
Two nights ago, you escaped.

820
01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.621
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

821
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:40.023
No, you're lying.

822
01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:46.497
You are Walton Grey, and
you killed my family.


823
01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:50.267
- No, Gwen.

824
01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:54.338
You, killed your family.

825
01:02:54.873 --> 01:02:57.608
(ominous music)

826
01:03:06.918 --> 01:03:09.386
(ominous music continues)

827
01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.722
Do you remember
what you told me?


828
01:03:12.656 --> 01:03:16.627
Huh? How they mistreated you?

829
01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:19.730
How they hated you?

830
01:03:21.799 --> 01:03:24.201
You were the family stain.

831
01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.907
What did you do to your family?

832
01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.076
Gwen, do you remember?

833
01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:39.483
(deafening sinister music)

834
01:03:42.787 --> 01:03:44.154
- No.

835
01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:48.158
(deafening sinister music)

836
01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:50.828
No, no, no, no.

837
01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:53.697
No.

838
01:03:55.867 --> 01:03:59.236
Walton Grey killed my family.

839
01:04:02.774 --> 01:04:05.609
- There is no Walton Grey.

840
01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:08.645
You made him up.

841
01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:13.751
His name, it's an
anagram of your name,


842
01:04:16.153 --> 01:04:17.354
Gwen Taylor.

843
01:04:19.924 --> 01:04:21.826
He's a figment of
your imagination.


844
01:04:21.859 --> 01:04:24.595
(ominous music)

845
01:04:34.005 --> 01:04:37.608
(ominous music continues)

846
01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:43.213
You need your medication, Gwen.

847
01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:45.682
You're not well.

848
01:04:54.092 --> 01:04:55.626
I uh,

849
01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:57.227
I called the hospital,

850
01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.863
once I knew I'd found you.

851
01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:09.807
See, the necklace. The necklace.

852
01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:12.242
Remember?

853
01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:13.745
You told me that you
wore it the night


854
01:05:13.778 --> 01:05:15.312
that you killed your family.

855
01:05:16.948 --> 01:05:20.384
You told me it was the only gift
that your mother ever gave you.


856
01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:22.854
Remember you telling me that?

857
01:05:22.887 --> 01:05:25.622
(ominous music)

858
01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:37.869
(ominous music continues)

859
01:05:37.902 --> 01:05:40.570
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen,
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen.


860
01:05:40.604 --> 01:05:43.240
Gwen, listen to me.
Listen to me, Gwen.


861
01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.309
I need you to hand
me those scissors.


862
01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:51.783
Please, hand me the scissors.
Hand me the scissors.


863
01:05:52.984 --> 01:05:55.119
Gwen, put--

864

(ominous music)

865
01:06:08.032 --> 01:06:10.233
- Open your fucking mouth.

866
01:06:13.905 --> 01:06:15.405
- You sure this is the place?

867
01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.876
- The All Tucked Inn.
That's what the doc said.


868
01:06:20.377 --> 01:06:23.346
- Well, maybe you
give them a call.


869
01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:27.819
This my motel is shit.

870
01:06:29.686 --> 01:06:32.422
(ominous music)

871
01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:39.663

the hell is she doing?

Alice?

talk about all this?

I've been looking all
over the place for you.


950

What were you um...

951
01:15:01.298 --> 01:15:03.968
Wh, what, what were you doing
down in the pool?

<i>you now, sweetie?</i>


958
01:15:37.801 --> 01:15:39.403
- I just passed through Denning,

959
01:15:39.436 --> 01:15:42.039
but I'm thinking I
should probably stop soon


960
01:15:42.072 --> 01:15:45.476
because I think I'm on
seven hours straight now.


961
01:15:48.445 --> 01:15:50.881
There's a motel up ahead.
It's a popular spot.

01:16:59.383 --> 01:17:00.517
- [Cole] Hi.

974
01:17:00.551 --> 01:17:02.586
- Admiring our pool I see.

975
01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:03.854
- [Cole] Yeah.

976
01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:06.090
- Certainly is one of our
most impressive features.


977
01:17:06.123 --> 01:17:07.624
The guests just love it.

978
01:17:07.658 --> 01:17:10.461
- I bet. It's a... it's dope.

979
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:14.531
- You won't believe this,

980
01:17:14.565 --> 01:17:18.135
but last year we had a giant
sinkhole at the bottom.


981
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:20.839
- For real?

982
01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:23.640
- Sucked the water right out.

983
01:17:23.674 --> 01:17:24.908
I mean, the hole was so big,

984
01:17:24.942 --> 01:17:29.646
you could fit five people
down there. (laughs)


985
01:17:30.881 --> 01:17:32.449
- No way.

986
01:17:32.483 --> 01:17:35.919
(Gwen continues laughing)

987
01:17:36.987 --> 01:17:39.957
(birds chirping)

988
01:17:44.763 --> 01:17:47.364
- Come on, let me check you in.

989
01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:50.167
- Yeah.

990
01:17:51.803 --> 01:17:54.238
(keyboard clicking)

991
01:18:01.645 --> 01:18:02.646
- Sign here.

992
01:18:04.816 --> 01:18:06.751
Have you traveled far?

993
01:18:06.785 --> 01:18:08.185
- No, just out of state.

994
01:18:08.218 --> 01:18:11.455
Yeah, heading down to Ashford
for college, actually.


995
01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:14.558
You ever been to Ashford?

996
01:18:17.762 --> 01:18:19.196
- Can't say that I have.

997
01:18:21.231 --> 01:18:22.199
Now,

998
01:18:22.966 --> 01:18:24.535
let me...

999
01:18:25.002 --> 01:18:26.703
put you in...

1000
01:18:30.507 --> 01:18:31.942
...cabin eight.

1001
01:18:32.911 --> 01:18:34.378
Oh, it's my favorite.

1002
01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:37.981
- Sounds great.

(ominous music)

1004
01:18:52.429 --> 01:18:53.430
Are you okay?

1005
01:18:57.568 --> 01:18:58.602
- Never better.

1006
01:18:59.938 --> 01:19:01.538
Let me show you to your room.

1007
