00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:06.101
Shit.

2
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:08.069
Oh, god.

3
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.032
Jim.

4
00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:41.202
Hi Amanda.

5
00:03:42.304 --> 00:03:43.238
Hi.

6
00:03:43.673 --> 00:03:44.606
Oh my god.

7
00:03:57.053 --> 00:03:58.353
How are you?

8
00:03:58.355 --> 00:03:59.421
I am...

9
00:03:59.855 --> 00:04:01.189
I am really good.

10
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:03.291
How are you?

11
00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:04.325
Good.

12
00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:11.800
How are you?
Did I ask that already?


13
00:04:11.802 --> 00:04:13.201
-You did, but I am happy to...
-Okay.


14
00:04:13.203 --> 00:04:14.602
Happy to tell you again.

15
00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:15.704
You're good?

16
00:04:15.706 --> 00:04:17.138
-Yeah.
-Great.


17
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.742
So, you...
Are you...


18
00:04:20.744 --> 00:04:22.010
Are you living
here now? Or you...


19
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.712
Oh, no, I'm...

20
00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:26.715
I'm here to see my sister.

21
00:04:26.717 --> 00:04:27.882
-Okay.
-You remember?


22
00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:28.950
-Yeah.
-I'm sure... yeah.


23
00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:30.618
-It's elissa.
-Yeah.


24
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:37.659
Getting... cooking...
Just some...


25
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:40.829
Grated ginger
and capers and...


26
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:43.364
Ice cream.

27
00:04:49.972 --> 00:04:52.874
I didn't brush my teeth.

28
00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:55.844
That's why I'm licking my teeth
a lot right now, I don't know.


29
00:04:58.214 --> 00:04:59.948
So, anyway, I don't want
to hold you...


30
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.449
Obviously if you have...

31
00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:03.551
Yeah.

32
00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:05.620
Cool.

33
00:05:05.622 --> 00:05:07.088
Yeah. Okay.

34
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.490
-All right.
-Yeah.


35
00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:27.442
Fuck.

36
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.213
Here's your change.

37
00:06:08.351 --> 00:06:09.851
This is my car. Yeah.

38
00:06:10.152 --> 00:06:11.753
That's...

39
00:06:11.755 --> 00:06:13.454
-Too weird.
-Weird.


40
00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:22.163
Hey, do you want
to get a coffee?


41
00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:25.934
Maybe?

42
00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:30.471
Sure.

43
00:06:33.742 --> 00:06:34.676
-Yes.
-Great.


44
00:06:49.525 --> 00:06:50.792
Yeah, good.

45
00:06:53.028 --> 00:06:54.329
It's good.

46
00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:57.498
Good, yeah.

47
00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:16.484
I heard about your mom.

48
00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:19.854
I was really
sorry to hear it.


49
00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:21.055
Oh yeah, thanks.

50
00:07:21.057 --> 00:07:23.358
You know, she...

51
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.161
She was sick for a little bit,
so it was, you know, we were
prepared for it


52
00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:28.663
-but thanks, you know.
-Yeah.


53
00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:31.165
But...

54
00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:34.302
We've been clearing out
her house a little bit


55
00:07:34.304 --> 00:07:36.204
and I think would
have fix it up and...


56
00:07:36.206 --> 00:07:37.705
Maybe sell it, so...

57
00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:38.539
Fix it up yourself?

58
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.675
Yeah. That's kind
of what I do.


59
00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:44.979
Work on houses and stuff.

60
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:47.415
-Wow.
-Yeah.


61
00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:50.118
You build them?
You do all the...


62
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.621
I do... I mostly
do the dry wall stuff.


63
00:07:55.324 --> 00:07:59.127
Uncle John runs the business,
so I got caught up with him,
like...


64
00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:00.495
You know, we did
a bunch of work.


65
00:08:00.497 --> 00:08:02.997
In New Orleans
after Katrina and then...


66
00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:04.132
It's boring as shit but...

67
00:08:04.134 --> 00:08:05.566
It's not boring.
It's not boring.


68
00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.402
I didn't know that's what
you were doing.


69
00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:11.472
Yeah. It's good. It's steady
and it's consistent.


70
00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:14.642
And... yeah, it's cool.
It's fun.


71
00:08:18.347 --> 00:08:20.114
-What?
-What?


72
00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:21.783
I don't know.
You seem...


73
00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:22.650
Yeah, yeah.

74
00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:25.286
No, it's good.
It's like...


75
00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:28.156
I end up in tuscon
and it's great.


76
00:08:28.158 --> 00:08:30.325
Really nice, warm climate
and I dig it.


77
00:08:30.327 --> 00:08:31.659
-It's too hot.
-No, it's good.


78
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:34.329
It's better, you know,
it's not like here.


79
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.663
So...

80
00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:39.767
That's... that's what
I've been doing.


81
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.169
-Wow.
-Yeah.


82
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:42.837
Tuscon. Warm.

83
00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:44.372
You know,
my parents moved.


84
00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:45.974
To Florida.

85
00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:48.543
To be warm.

86
00:08:49.044 --> 00:08:50.311
Yeah.

87
00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:52.113
They may move back.
They may have to move back.


88
00:08:52.115 --> 00:08:54.248
Yeah. What's going on?

89
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.717
My sister's having a baby.

90
00:08:57.553 --> 00:08:58.653
Wow.

91
00:09:00.155 --> 00:09:02.790
Yeah. That's the grand
parent pressure.


92
00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:03.958
-Yeah.
-You know.


93
00:09:04.893 --> 00:09:06.361
You're not married, huh?

94
00:09:06.363 --> 00:09:08.296
No. Married to the work.

95
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.397
Married to the dry wall?

96
00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:10.665
Married to the work.

97
00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:12.633
You know, I like it.
You know, it's good.


98
00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.902
It's really good for me.
I think that's how I...


99
00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:16.771
Yeah, it's good and...

100
00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:20.575
I think it's bright for me.
You know.


101
00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:28.816
You okay?

102
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.754
Yeah.

103
00:09:32.756 --> 00:09:33.788
Okay.

104
00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:43.998
Trying to get through
this coffee.


105
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.566
This coffee is terrible.

106
00:09:46.402 --> 00:09:48.169
The blue Jay has gone
down the hill.


107
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:49.537
Yeah.

108
00:09:54.576 --> 00:09:55.476
What?

109
00:09:55.478 --> 00:09:56.778
Tell me about
your husband.


110
00:09:58.414 --> 00:09:59.781
-Really?
-Yeah.


111
00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:03.651
Oh, god. I don't even know
where to start.


112
00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:09.223
I got really lucky.

113
00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:13.161
He's a really...
Incredibly supportive,


114
00:10:13.163 --> 00:10:15.530
very nurturing,
wonderful guy.


115
00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:16.697
His name is Chris.

116
00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.067
And when I met him,
he had two small boys.


117
00:10:19.968 --> 00:10:20.968
And so...

118
00:10:21.937 --> 00:10:25.807
Boom! Insta... insta mom.

119
00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:29.010
And his ex-wife was really
wonderful to me.


120
00:10:29.012 --> 00:10:33.347
Their whole childhood
we had a week with them
and a week off.


121
00:10:33.349 --> 00:10:35.283
And so, you know,

122
00:10:35.285 --> 00:10:37.952
one week, it's just
the two of us. We can do
whatever we want


123
00:10:37.954 --> 00:10:41.322
whenever we want to
and footloose and fancy
free and then next week


124
00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:43.558
it's little league
and soccer games


125
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.393
and then studying
for their sat's


126
00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.162
and college tours
and you know...


127
00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:49.597
Yep.

128
00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:53.568
What?

129
00:10:54.169 --> 00:10:55.203
It's crazy.

130
00:10:55.205 --> 00:10:56.304
It's crazy. Yeah.

131
00:10:56.306 --> 00:10:58.039
It's just crazy.
It's great.


132
00:11:00.876 --> 00:11:02.276
Jim. What?

133
00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:05.346
It's crazy.
It's just crazy.


134
00:11:05.348 --> 00:11:06.447
Would you stop it?

135
00:11:06.449 --> 00:11:07.582
I am not
doing anything.


136
00:11:07.584 --> 00:11:09.183
You're doing something
with your face.


137
00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:10.918
I'm not
doing anything.


138
00:11:12.154 --> 00:11:14.355
My face leaks.
I don't know.


139
00:11:14.357 --> 00:11:15.623
But it's fine.

140
00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:19.160
It's fine. It's fine.

141
00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:22.163
-Good.
-Anyway.


142
00:11:23.632 --> 00:11:25.933
There's a pregnant woman
waiting for her ice cream.


143
00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.602
Oh, yes. God.

144
00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.103
I'll walk you back
to your car.


145
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.705
-Okay.
-Yeah. Come on.


146
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.397
Park dental
by the way, gone.


147
00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.032
Yeah.

148
00:11:58.034 --> 00:12:00.468
You had a couple
of cavities filled there.


149
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.804
I think you had nine,
was that the record?


150
00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.339
Would have been
more like 11.


151
00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:06.774
Yeah.

152
00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:09.243
That's what happens when you
have love of jelly bean...


153
00:12:09.245 --> 00:12:10.211
Jim.

154
00:12:13.048 --> 00:12:14.282
There's no way.

155
00:12:14.284 --> 00:12:15.383
Oh, come on!

156
00:12:15.385 --> 00:12:17.285
No, that's not possible.

157
00:12:17.287 --> 00:12:18.452
I think it's him.

158
00:12:18.454 --> 00:12:19.921
No that's his grandson.

159
00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:22.256
He was like a hundred
in high school.


160
00:12:22.258 --> 00:12:23.491
That's his hat,

161
00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:25.259
-I'm telling you that's his hat.
-Oh, my god!


162
00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:27.228
Wayne travels
with wayney man.


163
00:12:30.365 --> 00:12:31.732
What?

164
00:12:31.734 --> 00:12:33.534
Do you think
he would remember?


165
00:12:34.836 --> 00:12:36.404
I'm not sure
he's alive.


166
00:12:36.406 --> 00:12:38.372
I haven't seen
him move yet.


167
00:12:38.374 --> 00:12:39.674
No he's not
going to remember.


168
00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.909
That was our dorky
thing that we did.


169
00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:43.444
That was...

170
00:12:43.446 --> 00:12:45.746
You want to put
a wager on it?


171
00:12:45.748 --> 00:12:48.249
I'll bet you $100,
he doesn't remember.


172
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:49.483
A $100?

173
00:12:49.485 --> 00:12:50.952
I'll bet you a $100.

174
00:12:58.126 --> 00:12:59.727
-Hi wayney.
-Hi wayney.


175
00:12:59.729 --> 00:13:01.062
Hey.

176
00:13:01.064 --> 00:13:02.129
What's up?

177
00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:06.834
We were wanting
to go traveling.


178
00:13:13.308 --> 00:13:14.809
You're talking...

179
00:13:14.811 --> 00:13:17.445
Yeah that's exactly
what I'm talking about.


180
00:13:17.447 --> 00:13:18.546
Okay.

181
00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:19.480
Thanks wayney.

182
00:13:19.482 --> 00:13:21.115
-Thank you, wayney.
-Yeah.


183
00:13:21.483 --> 00:13:22.617
Yeah.

184
00:13:23.485 --> 00:13:24.619
I told you.

185
00:13:24.621 --> 00:13:26.087
-Come on. You planted that.
-I told you!


186
00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:28.222
I did not,
you owe me a $100.


187
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:29.290
I don't have $100.

188
00:13:29.292 --> 00:13:30.324
Well you owe me a $100.

189
00:13:30.326 --> 00:13:31.525
All right.

190
00:13:31.527 --> 00:13:32.560
Mexico.

191
00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:33.828
Yeah, hit me.

192
00:13:34.429 --> 00:13:35.463
Hit it!

193
00:13:35.465 --> 00:13:36.497
What you got?

194
00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:38.099
-Japan.
-Okay.


195
00:13:38.967 --> 00:13:40.268
I got Brooklyn.

196
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.802
-Oh Germany.
-Hey wayney!


197
00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:43.738
Do you have any zima?

198
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.374
I believe
they pulled it off
the market.


199
00:13:46.376 --> 00:13:47.842
What about gold schlagger?

200
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.344
We don't carry
that anymore.


201
00:13:50.346 --> 00:13:51.545
That's more like it.

202
00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:52.680
-Belgium.
-Belgium.


203
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:55.716
Jinxed.

204
00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.820
-Yeah?
-Good.


205
00:14:06.194 --> 00:14:09.463
I know who you are now,
you're the love birds.


206
00:14:09.465 --> 00:14:11.299
The famous lovebirds.

207
00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:13.401
You're still together, right?

208
00:14:16.805 --> 00:14:19.540
What?
What's the matter, what?


209
00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:21.375
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:14:23.278 --> 00:14:25.513
- Yeah, it's... you know...
- -What?


211
00:14:25.515 --> 00:14:27.114
-It's 24 years.
-Yeah?


212
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.182
Still going strong.

213
00:14:28.184 --> 00:14:31.819
-Oh, congratulations guys.
-Thanks.


214
00:14:32.587 --> 00:14:34.188
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.


215
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.389
I got your jelly beans.

216
00:14:40.595 --> 00:14:42.496
All right wayney,
what do we owe you?


217
00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:44.932
You don't owe me anything,
your money is no good here.


218
00:14:44.934 --> 00:14:46.734
-Come on.
-Come on, let an old man,


219
00:14:46.736 --> 00:14:48.369
buy something please.

220
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:50.104
Make me happy, okay?

221
00:14:51.373 --> 00:14:52.873
Congratulations again.

222
00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:54.241
-Nice to see you.
-Yeah.


223
00:14:54.243 --> 00:14:55.409
Yeah, good to see
you guys.


224
00:14:56.311 --> 00:14:57.378
Looking good.

225
00:14:58.547 --> 00:14:59.980
You look exactly
the same.


226
00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:03.284
Get out of here. Come on now.
You're gonna make me cry.


227
00:15:20.068 --> 00:15:21.769
Is the coat warm
enough for you?


228
00:15:22.237 --> 00:15:23.471
Okay, yeah.

229
00:15:25.574 --> 00:15:27.174
Yeah that's the one...

230
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.432
It served pizza
long time ago.


231
00:16:07.015 --> 00:16:09.583
Yeah but
i remember being like...


232
00:16:09.585 --> 00:16:11.152
Did they move them?

233
00:16:11.154 --> 00:16:13.087
That it.
No, that's it.


234
00:16:13.089 --> 00:16:15.156
See, 'cause I use
to put my leg


235
00:16:15.158 --> 00:16:16.924
-oh yeah.
-Right here. Watch.


236
00:16:16.926 --> 00:16:18.492
-Wait.
-Here we go.


237
00:16:18.494 --> 00:16:19.860
Hold on. Let's see.

238
00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:22.029
Come on. Hold this.

239
00:16:24.599 --> 00:16:26.300
I still got the stuff.

240
00:16:32.507 --> 00:16:35.209
So, what's next
for you?


241
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:37.578
You're going back
to Tucson or...


242
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.747
You're working?
You got a house,


243
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:41.649
you're gonna build?

244
00:16:41.651 --> 00:16:44.351
I don't know,
Tucson is...


245
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:53.060
And work stuff's
kinda up in the air.


246
00:16:53.062 --> 00:16:54.428
-What does that mean?
-So...


247
00:16:56.398 --> 00:16:57.631
Do you not
like doing it?


248
00:16:57.633 --> 00:17:00.301
No it's good, it's...

249
00:17:01.837 --> 00:17:03.437
I don't know.

250
00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:07.475
I have to admit there's a small
part of me as I was sitting...


251
00:17:07.477 --> 00:17:10.711
In the old house
and thinking about
fixing it up.


252
00:17:10.713 --> 00:17:12.446
And I'm starting
to think like...


253
00:17:14.015 --> 00:17:15.316
I don't know maybe...

254
00:17:16.651 --> 00:17:18.519
I could stay here.

255
00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:20.020
It looks
interesting to me.


256
00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.423
What would you
do here though?


257
00:17:23.558 --> 00:17:24.859
It's just a thought,
i don't...


258
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:26.927
-I mean, I've no plan.
-I know, I like...


259
00:17:27.696 --> 00:17:28.963
Don't you want...

260
00:17:28.965 --> 00:17:30.097
Why you grilling me
right now?


261
00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:31.932
I'm not trying
to grill you, I just...


262
00:17:34.035 --> 00:17:36.537
I guess I'm a little
worried about you?


263
00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:37.738
Why are you worried
about me?


264
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.907
I don't know, you don't...
You seem...


265
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:44.778
I don't know a little,
lost or...


266
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.915
I haven't got it all,
figured out.


267
00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:50.017
But... you know...

268
00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:54.555
Isn't there anything
you want to do?


269
00:17:54.557 --> 00:17:57.258
Amanda, I don't fucking
know what I'm doing, okay?


270
00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.027
I had lost my job, okay?
I lost my job.


271
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:01.695
I had a falling out
with my uncle


272
00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:05.299
who was stealing clients
from me and I beat
the fuck out of him, okay?


273
00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:07.968
I beat the living shit
out of him.


274
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.304
It was a really scary
moment and I had a crack


275
00:18:10.306 --> 00:18:12.506
and I feel awful
about it and I'm...


276
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:16.110
I'm sorry,
i didn't... I...


277
00:18:17.245 --> 00:18:18.579
Oh!

278
00:18:18.581 --> 00:18:21.115
So I'm living in Tucson
and I don't want to stay
there anymore


279
00:18:21.117 --> 00:18:23.117
but I don't really
know where else to go.


280
00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:26.921
And it's...
I'm having a...


281
00:18:28.056 --> 00:18:30.524
Just having a hard time, so.

282
00:18:30.526 --> 00:18:31.959
I'm sorry, yeah.

283
00:18:31.961 --> 00:18:33.327
I'm not...

284
00:18:33.329 --> 00:18:34.828
I'm gonna start
crying again.


285
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.998
-Yeah.
-This is a thing with me,
all right?


286
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.867
I really think
it's your fault, honestly.


287
00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:41.268
Why is it my fault?

288
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.470
You use to give me
the best head rubs.


289
00:18:44.439 --> 00:18:46.574
And they use to really
take the edge off.


290
00:18:50.845 --> 00:18:53.380
Quit hiding the jelly beans
hand 'em up.


291
00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:54.181
Come on.

292
00:18:54.183 --> 00:18:56.083
Give me some
jelly beans, okay?


293
00:18:56.085 --> 00:18:58.018
That's why I'm so sad

294
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.287
'cause you won't
give me any jelly beans.


295
00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:05.893
It's also little hard 'cause
you're really impressive.


296
00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:07.595
Your life is really impressive.

297
00:19:07.597 --> 00:19:09.563
-Yeah...
-So there's a part
of me that's...


298
00:19:10.298 --> 00:19:11.565
Just saying.

299
00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:15.603
I was getting on the plane
and there was this family


300
00:19:16.404 --> 00:19:19.173
and this little boy,

301
00:19:19.708 --> 00:19:22.409
he was so mad

302
00:19:23.244 --> 00:19:25.245
and just irate

303
00:19:25.247 --> 00:19:29.917
and of course he has no way
of expressing any of that
except sort of just like...


304
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:33.420
Scream and stomp
his feet and...


305
00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:36.256
I mean, he was screaming
so loud that tongue
was curing to the back


306
00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:38.492
of his mouth and tears
were just like...


307
00:19:38.494 --> 00:19:41.328
You know, springing out
of his face he was...


308
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.231
Leaking you know.

309
00:19:44.233 --> 00:19:46.767
And I just remember
looking at him and being
very jealous.


310
00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:48.636
You know,
that's my soul-mate.


311
00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:51.905
Me and that four year old.
That's my soul-mate.


312
00:19:51.907 --> 00:19:55.376
I don't know some point
we just learn it's better
not to do that and...


313
00:19:56.678 --> 00:19:58.212
I don't know
at what point...


314
00:19:59.414 --> 00:20:00.347
Here.

315
00:20:03.051 --> 00:20:04.318
You ate a lot of them.

316
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.419
I did eat a lot.

317
00:20:14.829 --> 00:20:16.764
You left me all the pink
and purple ones


318
00:20:22.103 --> 00:20:24.605
yeah, they are
your favorites.


319
00:20:37.719 --> 00:20:39.119
What's up?

320
00:20:39.121 --> 00:20:41.422
Miss elissa wants to know
where's her ice-cream is at?


321
00:20:41.424 --> 00:20:42.389
Of course.

322
00:20:43.491 --> 00:20:44.825
Oh god!

323
00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:46.527
Does she like
ice-cream soup.


324
00:20:47.997 --> 00:20:50.164
I'm just telling her
i ran into some one.


325
00:20:52.033 --> 00:20:56.403
Don't take it person... sorry
yes. Okay fine I'll tell her
it's you just...


326
00:20:56.405 --> 00:20:58.138
-She'll ask me who.
-She's gonna ask...


327
00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.573
-There is is.
-Jim.


328
00:20:59.575 --> 00:21:01.375
Lisa, Lisa the interrogator.

329
00:21:04.746 --> 00:21:07.281
Holy fuckity fuck!
Jim, Jim?


330
00:21:07.283 --> 00:21:08.849
She's Lisa lising you.

331
00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:10.384
Yeah Jim Jim,

332
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.487
yes.

333
00:21:18.793 --> 00:21:20.561
She wants to know
how you look.


334
00:21:34.476 --> 00:21:36.443
She wants to know, when I'm
coming back.


335
00:21:53.762 --> 00:21:55.429
I kinda want
to see your house.


336
00:21:56.631 --> 00:21:57.765
You want
to see the house?


337
00:22:12.614 --> 00:22:15.516
It's been really great
catching up with you.


338
00:22:17.352 --> 00:22:20.621
But if the reason you spending
time with me is because...


339
00:22:21.689 --> 00:22:23.257
You feel sorry for me.

340
00:22:24.592 --> 00:22:27.861
You don't have to do it,
it's okay. Okay?


341
00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.824
Sorry, just the boxes.

342
00:23:32.026 --> 00:23:32.993
Sorry.

343
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:33.961
It's okay.

344
00:23:36.497 --> 00:23:37.564
Here we go.

345
00:23:39.367 --> 00:23:41.201
Yeah, still got
a lot of...


346
00:23:41.203 --> 00:23:42.436
Her stuff to pack up.

347
00:23:42.438 --> 00:23:43.470
Yeah

348
00:23:44.606 --> 00:23:45.906
that's a good one
in particular.


349
00:23:45.908 --> 00:23:46.907
Yeah, I'll say.

350
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:49.110
Yeah.

351
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.945
Yeah, pretty much
how she left it so...


352
00:23:51.947 --> 00:23:53.413
I've been thinking about...

353
00:23:54.382 --> 00:23:56.283
Dry walling where
the paneling is


354
00:23:56.285 --> 00:23:57.584
maybe take out
that wall,


355
00:23:57.586 --> 00:24:00.320
so that it opens
into the kitchen.


356
00:24:00.322 --> 00:24:02.589
I don't know there's also
something kind of...


357
00:24:03.157 --> 00:24:04.691
Cozy about the way it is.

358
00:24:06.928 --> 00:24:07.861
Thinking about it.

359
00:24:09.397 --> 00:24:12.966
Anyway, make yourself at home.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.


360
00:24:12.968 --> 00:24:14.334
Will see you
in a sec.


361
00:25:42.757 --> 00:25:44.358
Oh, my god.

362
00:25:47.862 --> 00:25:51.431
This is a very serious
collection of romance novels.


363
00:25:52.934 --> 00:25:54.434
This could not
have been here...


364
00:25:54.436 --> 00:25:55.569
When we were
spending all that time


365
00:25:55.571 --> 00:25:56.837
I think there were some

366
00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:59.840
I think she really
started collecting


367
00:25:59.842 --> 00:26:02.809
-when I left
and I wasn't here to...
-Yeah...


368
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:05.479
-We would have
a field day with it.
-Yeah.


369
00:26:05.481 --> 00:26:08.215
Well, I mean
let's face it,


370
00:26:08.217 --> 00:26:10.050
in your hay-day
you were pretty...


371
00:26:10.052 --> 00:26:11.284
In my hay-day?

372
00:26:11.286 --> 00:26:12.386
You were pretty romantic.

373
00:26:12.388 --> 00:26:14.454
I'm remembering...

374
00:26:14.456 --> 00:26:17.524
When you read<i>wuthering heights</i>
and you made me read it


375
00:26:17.526 --> 00:26:19.493
and you sent me that...

376
00:26:19.495 --> 00:26:21.895
I think it was four
legal page...


377
00:26:21.897 --> 00:26:23.930
-Jim, that's extreme...
-Letters about...


378
00:26:23.932 --> 00:26:25.232
You called me heathcliff

379
00:26:25.234 --> 00:26:26.833
and you called
your self Catherine.


380
00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:30.037
-I am you
and you are me.
-Please stop it!


381
00:26:30.039 --> 00:26:31.204
Yes so, by the way

382
00:26:31.206 --> 00:26:32.339
completely humiliating.

383
00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:33.774
Don't pretend you're
all above this.


384
00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:35.675
There's a very
big difference.


385
00:26:35.677 --> 00:26:38.378
I would like to point out
between this


386
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.080
lovely array of books and

387
00:26:40.082 --> 00:26:43.150
the great work of art
and literature that
is<i>wuthering heights.</i>


388
00:26:43.152 --> 00:26:44.918
I mean they cannot
be compared.


389
00:26:46.421 --> 00:26:47.788
Here's something for you.

390
00:26:48.689 --> 00:26:50.390
"Right away.

391
00:26:50.392 --> 00:26:52.993
She knew that her heart
and soul belonged


392
00:26:52.995 --> 00:26:54.094
to Justin."

393
00:26:54.896 --> 00:26:57.030
What Justin?

394
00:27:00.468 --> 00:27:03.537
There's no sexier
name than Justin.


395
00:27:04.038 --> 00:27:05.872
"Oh, Justin!

396
00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:07.107
Do it to me Justin."

397
00:27:07.109 --> 00:27:08.308
-Oh, come on.
-Sorry.


398
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.609
No, there's more.

399
00:27:09.611 --> 00:27:12.112
"But it wasn't until tonight
that she realized


400
00:27:12.114 --> 00:27:14.848
Justin also owned
her body."


401
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.518
I'm sorry there's no
comparison between this
and<i>wuthering heights.</i>


402
00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.253
-It really, first of all...
-It's really


403
00:27:20.255 --> 00:27:21.588
sacrilegious thing...

404
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.323
I don't want to think
about my mother reading it.


405
00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:25.459
You know what?
Neither do I, I have to say.


406
00:27:25.461 --> 00:27:26.793
I've been staring
at these books


407
00:27:26.795 --> 00:27:28.995
I'm trying to figure out
how to get rid of them


408
00:27:28.997 --> 00:27:29.963
why?

409
00:27:29.965 --> 00:27:30.864
Well, I don't know,

410
00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:32.699
it's weird like
i had this weird...


411
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:36.403
I had a very strange mortality
moment when I looked
at them and I was like this


412
00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:37.838
eight hundred books here,

413
00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:40.507
and even if I...

414
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:42.843
For some reason wanted
to read all of these books


415
00:27:42.845 --> 00:27:46.046
I wouldn't be able
to finish all of these
books before I died.


416
00:27:46.048 --> 00:27:49.983
That's a weird thing,
you know the math of that.


417
00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:52.219
Pretty morbid thought.

418
00:27:52.221 --> 00:27:53.320
No just...

419
00:27:53.322 --> 00:27:55.455
Not to be morbid
but just a thing.


420
00:27:57.225 --> 00:27:58.158
Well...

421
00:27:59.994 --> 00:28:02.929
You know it's all
relative, I think.


422
00:28:06.167 --> 00:28:07.801
I mean, my husband
you know...


423
00:28:09.604 --> 00:28:12.839
Maybe he would make
it through this, section.


424
00:28:15.109 --> 00:28:16.143
If you were lucky.

425
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.950
-I don't know.
-Yeah.


426
00:28:27.355 --> 00:28:30.924
Can I... do you mind
if I go out side? I have
to make a phone call.


427
00:28:30.926 --> 00:28:32.092
Yeah, yeah of course.

428
00:28:34.896 --> 00:28:35.962
You know the way.

429
00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:37.030
Yes I do.

430
00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:51.778
I know, I'm sorry.
I meant to call you, yeah.


431
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.815
The minute I got there she sent
me right out to get some food.


432
00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:57.984
Oh, yeah she
seems really...


433
00:28:58.553 --> 00:29:00.220
She seems really good.

434
00:29:00.222 --> 00:29:01.888
Yeah, she's just hungry.

435
00:29:05.459 --> 00:29:07.627
I think we're just
gonna stay in.


436
00:29:08.296 --> 00:29:09.763
Just you know...

437
00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:12.165
Watch a movie or...

438
00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:13.400
You know and eat.

439
00:29:15.937 --> 00:29:16.870
Yeah.

440
00:29:20.141 --> 00:29:23.677
Wait, can you just say
that again I didn't hear you.


441
00:29:24.946 --> 00:29:25.879
Yeah.

442
00:29:57.111 --> 00:29:58.044
This is amazing.

443
00:29:58.046 --> 00:30:00.647
This is amazing,
it's like a time capsule.


444
00:30:01.249 --> 00:30:02.215
It's all here.

445
00:30:02.917 --> 00:30:04.117
You needed
the black light...


446
00:30:04.119 --> 00:30:07.420
Hey it was 1993 you
needed a black light.


447
00:30:07.422 --> 00:30:08.722
Yeah I adore
the black light.


448
00:30:08.724 --> 00:30:10.056
You want to watch
some,<i>friends?</i>


449
00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:12.292
-Try outs?
-Try outs.


450
00:30:12.294 --> 00:30:15.962
The other option is I could
draw a little<i>gin blossoms.</i>


451
00:30:15.964 --> 00:30:17.063
Yes would you?

452
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.164
Or...

453
00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:21.067
Maybe<i>tilda weds brocket?</i>

454
00:30:21.936 --> 00:30:23.370
I hate the sound
of tilda weds...


455
00:30:23.372 --> 00:30:24.771
Fine,<i>blues traveler.</i>

456
00:30:24.773 --> 00:30:26.206
I like<i>blues traveler.</i>

457
00:30:29.176 --> 00:30:32.979
Oh, well, well...

458
00:30:37.219 --> 00:30:40.787
You literally have every shirt
you wore in high school still.


459
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:43.790
My mom kept stuff,
that's just...


460
00:30:45.126 --> 00:30:47.260
God, yeah.

461
00:30:47.262 --> 00:30:48.995
I remember
wearing this one.


462
00:30:50.298 --> 00:30:51.665
This one.

463
00:30:52.833 --> 00:30:54.367
I think this one is mine.

464
00:30:55.971 --> 00:30:57.837
Oh, I always
hated this one.


465
00:30:57.839 --> 00:30:59.205
I looked
good in that.


466
00:30:59.207 --> 00:31:01.441
You did not look good in it,
like a weird lumber Jack.


467
00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:03.143
You say that,
like it's a bad thing.


468
00:31:03.145 --> 00:31:04.244
It is a very
bad thing.


469
00:31:04.246 --> 00:31:05.345
Well, you know I'm sorry.

470
00:31:09.917 --> 00:31:11.551
-That's private property.
-Oh really?


471
00:31:11.553 --> 00:31:12.919
Have some respect, okay?

472
00:31:12.921 --> 00:31:15.288
For what? For your privacy?

473
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:16.690
Yes, exactly.

474
00:31:16.692 --> 00:31:18.458
You probably read
these to me out loud.


475
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:19.759
It's called privacy.

476
00:31:21.896 --> 00:31:23.630
No, no, that's private.

477
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:25.699
Oh, my...

478
00:31:25.701 --> 00:31:29.169
"The winds of change
are fucking blowing tonight."


479
00:31:29.171 --> 00:31:32.272
-No. Don't read.
-No.

Amanda.

482
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.777
Who knew her name
was going to be Amanda.


483
00:31:37.779 --> 00:31:39.746
-What a face."
-Hey!


484
00:31:39.748 --> 00:31:41.014
"What a spirit.

485
00:31:41.016 --> 00:31:43.483
My lips said hello
my friend


486
00:31:43.485 --> 00:31:46.086
but my heart said
hello my future.


487
00:31:49.423 --> 00:31:51.791
I don't even know
myself anymore.

for there is Amanda."

491
00:32:31.565 --> 00:32:33.299
Oh, my god!

492
00:32:34.402 --> 00:32:35.935
You want Japan
or New York?


493
00:32:36.404 --> 00:32:37.804
New York

494
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:42.008
oh, my god!

495
00:32:44.212 --> 00:32:47.013
I found a picture of you
that is outrageous.


496
00:32:57.425 --> 00:32:59.292
You don't deserve
this by the way.


497
00:32:59.294 --> 00:33:00.860
Digging through my stuff.

498
00:33:00.862 --> 00:33:02.829
Listen man, you don't have
lock on your shit


499
00:33:02.831 --> 00:33:04.431
it's bound to get
broken into.


500
00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:09.402
Man, I can't believe
you still have all this stuff.


501
00:33:10.504 --> 00:33:11.838
Little crazy.

502
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.406
Mom was a bit
of a hoarder.


503
00:33:13.707 --> 00:33:14.908
Yeah.

504
00:33:24.118 --> 00:33:25.485
Do you dare?

505
00:33:25.487 --> 00:33:26.820
Are you brave enough?

506
00:33:29.957 --> 00:33:32.459
"The winds of fucking change
are blowing tonight."


507
00:33:32.461 --> 00:33:34.027
Fuck you.

508
00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:38.264
"This first classic

00:33:43.171 --> 00:33:45.805
I don't know whats

-God damn it.


523

out of tape.

00:35:44.092 --> 00:35:45.525
<i>Yes, yes!</i>

<i>getting promoted.</i>
<i>-But, are you surprised?</i>


559
00:35:50.999 --> 00:35:55.501
<i>Ever since she</i>
<i>was three years old she</i>
<i>started telling me</i>


560
00:35:55.503 --> 00:35:57.937

<i>-yeah.</i>
<i>-Odd on the phone today.</i>


564
00:36:05.013 --> 00:36:08.214
<i>I think it's so hard</i>
<i>when your big sister</i>
<i>is so successful.</i>


565
00:36:08.216 --> 00:36:10.617
<i>Yeah must be,</i>
<i>but he's so wonderful</i>


566
00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:12.485
<i>in his own way.</i>

567
00:36:12.487 --> 00:36:14.921
<i>He's gonna find it,</i>
<i>I know he will.</i>


568
00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:16.889
<i>He's got your eyes.</i>

569
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:18.191
<i>He's got your heart.</i>

570
00:36:21.029 --> 00:36:22.862
<i>We've got that great</i>
<i>couple of kids.</i>


571
00:36:22.864 --> 00:36:24.397
<i>Oh yeah, they got</i>
<i>a great mom.</i>


572
00:36:24.399 --> 00:36:28.234
<i>-Best mom in the whole world.</i>
<i>-Best dad in the whole world.</i>


573
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.738
<i>It's kinda funny like...</i>

574
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.174
<i>Having the house</i>
<i>to ourselves again, isn't it?</i>


575
00:36:35.176 --> 00:36:38.144
<i>All those years with the four</i>
<i>of us running around,</i>


576
00:36:38.146 --> 00:36:40.079
<i>bumping in to each other.</i>

577
00:36:40.981 --> 00:36:42.649
<i>It's back down</i>
<i>to the two of us.</i>


578
00:36:43.751 --> 00:36:44.684
<i>Yeah.</i>

579
00:36:46.186 --> 00:36:48.321
<i>-But it's nice.</i>
<i>-Yeah, it's nice.</i>


580
00:36:49.923 --> 00:36:51.991
<i>Hey, I'm really sorry</i>

581
00:36:51.993 --> 00:36:54.093
<i>I forgot to get an</i>
<i>anniversary present.</i>


582
00:36:54.095 --> 00:36:55.762
<i>It's okay.</i>

583
00:36:55.764 --> 00:36:59.065
<i>I feel really bad,</i>
<i>I'm gonna go</i>
<i>to the bathroom I'll be quick.</i>


584
00:37:10.778 --> 00:37:13.379
<i>Jim, what are you doing?</i>

585
00:37:13.381 --> 00:37:16.382
<i>Oh, just nothing.</i>
<i>Here open it, open it.</i>


586
00:37:16.384 --> 00:37:19.719
<i>You got us tickets</i>
<i>to see Annie Lennox?</i>


587
00:37:19.721 --> 00:37:22.755
<i>Yes I did. Happy anniversary</i>
<i>to you late dancing.</i>


588
00:37:22.757 --> 00:37:25.358
<i>You're such a bitch,</i>
<i>you tricked me.</i>


589
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.362
<i>Yeah I still got a few tricks</i>
<i>left in my old sleeve here.</i>


590
00:37:35.302 --> 00:37:37.470
<i>I love you Amanda Henderson.</i>

591
00:37:37.472 --> 00:37:38.504
<i>I love you more.</i>

592
00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:39.972
<i>You are so good!</i>

593
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.343
<i>-You're still</i>
<i>like an old man.</i>
<i>-Surprise!</i>


594
00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:46.345
<i>You're still like an old man.</i>

595
00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:48.614
<i>I actually believe that</i>
<i>you could really cook.</i>


596
00:37:50.218 --> 00:37:52.285
<i>-Kiss me.</i>
<i>-Hey.</i>


597
00:37:52.287 --> 00:37:54.921
<i>-Here's to 80 more.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>


598
00:37:54.923 --> 00:37:56.222
<i>Hundred and twenty more.</i>

599
00:37:56.224 --> 00:37:58.057
<i>-Yeah we can do that, right?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>


600
00:38:11.605 --> 00:38:12.905
We weren't very cool.

601
00:38:12.907 --> 00:38:16.375
No, we were
deeply uncool.


602
00:38:16.844 --> 00:38:18.578
That was really...

603
00:38:19.279 --> 00:38:20.213
Yeah.

604
00:38:23.318 --> 00:38:25.151
I wonder where
that plane's going.


605
00:38:26.954 --> 00:38:28.087
It's not coming here.

606
00:38:30.258 --> 00:38:32.925
You'd think...
That town down there?


607
00:38:32.927 --> 00:38:34.393
-Suck!
-Suck!


608
00:38:34.395 --> 00:38:37.997
Although, you know what
it's the fact that it's dark.


609
00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:40.032
You can't quite see
the shithole-ness.


610
00:38:40.034 --> 00:38:41.634
That is right.

611
00:38:41.636 --> 00:38:42.769
And actually
right now...


612
00:38:42.771 --> 00:38:43.736
It does look
kinda pretty.


613
00:38:43.738 --> 00:38:44.737
It's kinds nice

614
00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:45.705
-right?
-Yeah.


615
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:49.242
Not so bad.

616
00:38:58.685 --> 00:39:00.186
What's on your mind, eh?

617
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:04.857
Is it that obvious?

618
00:39:08.529 --> 00:39:09.562
I was really...

619
00:39:11.131 --> 00:39:12.498
Little unnerving...

620
00:39:13.934 --> 00:39:17.303
Back there, listening
to all that stuff.


621
00:39:19.339 --> 00:39:24.143
I mean,
i seemed quite... fun.


622
00:39:24.978 --> 00:39:26.546
-First of all.
-Your rapping career


623
00:39:26.548 --> 00:39:30.683
didn't turn out the way
you hoped it would, I think.


624
00:39:30.685 --> 00:39:32.084
I understand.

625
00:39:38.759 --> 00:39:41.894
It's almost like I don't know
who that person was on the tape.


626
00:39:44.932 --> 00:39:47.300
I remember her
really well.


627
00:39:48.335 --> 00:39:49.669
She was really fun,
wasn't she?


628
00:39:49.671 --> 00:39:50.837
Yeah she's great.

629
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.174
-Yeah.
-And I...


630
00:39:55.176 --> 00:39:57.510
Don't get me wrong
it's not that my...


631
00:39:59.046 --> 00:40:00.746
Life isn't that...

632
00:40:01.648 --> 00:40:02.582
I just...

633
00:40:05.552 --> 00:40:06.853
-Amanda?
-What?


634
00:40:07.955 --> 00:40:09.288
I understand.

635
00:40:12.626 --> 00:40:14.560
You don't have to explain
it to me.


636
00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.671
Would you like to have
some fun tonight?


637
00:40:27.574 --> 00:40:30.243
Like just some...

638
00:40:31.545 --> 00:40:35.281
Stupid ass... fun,
tonight.


639
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.784
Well now I'm scared.
What you gonna do?


640
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.786
Do you trust me?

641
00:40:40.788 --> 00:40:42.188
I don't know.

642
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.823
-It's been a long time
i don't know.
-It's a big question.


643
00:40:43.825 --> 00:40:45.758
-Yeah, it's been
a long time.
-I really don't know.


644
00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:49.528
I say fuck
the ice-cream now.


645
00:40:51.765 --> 00:40:52.932
Fuck the ice-cream.

646
00:40:54.301 --> 00:40:55.668
Is that your new rap?

647
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.703
-Fuck the ice-cream.
-Fuck the ice-cream.


648
00:40:57.705 --> 00:40:58.838
Fuck the...

649
00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.273
Fuck, fuck...

650
00:41:00.275 --> 00:41:01.340
Fuck the ice-cream.

651
00:41:01.342 --> 00:41:02.942
Fuck the ice-cream.

652
00:41:55.429 --> 00:41:56.929
Honey I'm home.

653
00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:58.364
Hi, sweetheart.

654
00:41:58.366 --> 00:41:59.932
You have to close
your eyes.


655
00:41:59.934 --> 00:42:01.233
Please just stay
right up there,


656
00:42:01.235 --> 00:42:03.602
do not come down here
and close your eyes.


657
00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:05.304
Why do I have
to close my eyes?


658
00:42:05.306 --> 00:42:07.006
What's going on?

659
00:42:07.008 --> 00:42:08.407
Because, it's a surprise.

660
00:42:08.409 --> 00:42:09.709
Please sweetheart.

661
00:42:10.177 --> 00:42:11.744
Surprise, okay.

662
00:42:11.746 --> 00:42:13.813
Did you have a good day,
Mr. Henderson?


663
00:42:13.815 --> 00:42:16.849
Well, there's a lot to talk
about. How was your day Mrs.
Henderson?


664
00:42:16.851 --> 00:42:20.753
I have something very exciting
to tell you as well.


665
00:42:20.755 --> 00:42:24.323
Wow, that sounds like we
should have dinner and talk
about our day.


666
00:42:24.325 --> 00:42:27.126
Do me a favor and please
be patient.


667
00:42:27.128 --> 00:42:29.662
Okay, I'm being patient,
I'm closing my eyes.


668
00:42:29.664 --> 00:42:31.430
Keep them closed.

669
00:42:31.432 --> 00:42:33.766
You know I'll do anything
for you Mrs. Henderson.


670
00:42:34.768 --> 00:42:35.901
I'm counting on it.

671
00:42:37.571 --> 00:42:39.672
Something smells delicious.

672
00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:45.244
Hello.

673
00:42:45.246 --> 00:42:46.579
Hello, Mrs. Henderson.

674
00:42:47.414 --> 00:42:49.548
Hello, Mr. Henderson.

675
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:50.983
Keep your eyes closed
and come with me.


676
00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:51.984
Okay.

677
00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:53.185
-Come with me.
-Yes.


678
00:42:53.187 --> 00:42:54.653
Hold on to the railing please.

679
00:42:55.188 --> 00:42:56.989
-Okay.
-Okay.


680
00:42:58.325 --> 00:42:59.692
It's very exciting.

681
00:42:59.694 --> 00:43:01.560
-I love surprises.
-Tell me


682
00:43:01.562 --> 00:43:03.129
all about your day at work.

683
00:43:03.131 --> 00:43:04.430
Okay.

684
00:43:08.035 --> 00:43:10.803
On the count of three
i want you to open your eyes.


685
00:43:10.805 --> 00:43:11.737
Okay.

686
00:43:17.177 --> 00:43:18.978
Okay, go for it.

687
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.146
One...

688
00:43:21.148 --> 00:43:22.448
Two...

689
00:43:23.583 --> 00:43:24.617
Three...

690
00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:27.753
Oh, my god!
Look at this meal!


691
00:43:27.755 --> 00:43:29.355
It's gorgeous.

692
00:43:29.357 --> 00:43:31.991
You made all this?
You cooked all this?


693
00:43:31.993 --> 00:43:34.527
Have you been taking
cooking classes on the sly?


694
00:43:34.529 --> 00:43:36.195
-Maybe, Mr. Henderson.
-Oh my gosh!


695
00:43:36.197 --> 00:43:40.499
Mrs. Henderson this meal
is beautiful, it's elegant...


696
00:43:40.501 --> 00:43:42.034
Very French, Mr. Henderson.

697
00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:44.136
But, I have a question.

698
00:43:44.138 --> 00:43:45.704
What's the special occasion?

699
00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:47.706
I can't believe
you forgot.


700
00:43:48.341 --> 00:43:50.409
-What?
-Mr. Henderson?


701
00:43:53.547 --> 00:43:54.980
Cinemax.

702
00:43:54.982 --> 00:43:57.149
Happy 20th anniversary lover.

703
00:43:59.719 --> 00:44:02.655
Of course I didn't forget,
i was just playing.


704
00:44:02.657 --> 00:44:04.623
Happy anniversary sweetheart.

705
00:44:09.029 --> 00:44:10.196
There you are.

706
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.034
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.


707
00:44:16.269 --> 00:44:18.337
These eggs are really something.

708
00:44:18.339 --> 00:44:19.738
Really?

709
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.607
And the noodles,
are they Asian?


710
00:44:22.409 --> 00:44:24.110
They're really fantastic.

711
00:44:24.112 --> 00:44:27.480
Yes that I slaved over
for a very long time they're
very hard to make.


712
00:44:27.482 --> 00:44:28.681
Very hard to make.

713
00:44:28.683 --> 00:44:30.649
You can really taste
it in there.


714
00:44:30.651 --> 00:44:32.751
How is your day,
sweetheart?


715
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:36.055
Well, Glen Donovan
was added again honey.


716
00:44:36.057 --> 00:44:38.257
Glen Donovan, he's always
giving you such a hard time


717
00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:41.660
I don't know if I can take
another day with him I mean it's
good stable income


718
00:44:41.662 --> 00:44:43.796
until your career
takes off of course but...


719
00:44:43.798 --> 00:44:48.334
Well, it's very funny
that you should mention
that because I got a very


720
00:44:48.336 --> 00:44:49.668
exciting phone call today.

721
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.171
You did? What was your
phone call?


722
00:44:52.173 --> 00:44:53.939
I got a call today,

723
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:57.543
saying I got the opening slot.

724
00:44:58.678 --> 00:45:01.714
Opening... you got
the opening slot.


725
00:45:01.716 --> 00:45:05.618
I am going to open for...

726
00:45:06.386 --> 00:45:08.387
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.


727
00:45:08.389 --> 00:45:10.189
Oh very seriously.

728
00:45:10.191 --> 00:45:13.058
Are you going to be the first
female white rapper
to open for public enemy?


729
00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.995
I knew it! I knew you
could do it honey.


730
00:45:15.997 --> 00:45:18.531
Mrs. Henderson
they loved your demo.


731
00:45:18.533 --> 00:45:21.267
They loved my demo.
They thought is was so fresh


732
00:45:21.269 --> 00:45:23.302
I'm so impressed
come here.


733
00:45:23.304 --> 00:45:25.070
Cheers to you
Mrs. Henderson.


734
00:45:25.072 --> 00:45:27.039
I can't believe it. Oh, no.

735
00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:31.043
But you'll be on tour and I'll
miss you and I'll be so sad.


736
00:45:31.045 --> 00:45:32.144
What do we do about that?

737
00:45:35.682 --> 00:45:37.583
What do you think
about saying...


738
00:45:38.051 --> 00:45:39.051
Fuck you!

739
00:45:39.452 --> 00:45:41.220
To Glen Donovan?

740
00:45:41.222 --> 00:45:45.124
I do it inside of my head
everyday darling, I'd love
to say it out loud.


741
00:45:45.126 --> 00:45:47.793
Tell me what you have?
Tell me.


742
00:45:47.795 --> 00:45:49.195
Okay, but you promise
not to laugh.


743
00:45:49.197 --> 00:45:50.796
I won't laugh.

744
00:45:50.798 --> 00:45:52.865
I would never laugh
at you honey.


745
00:45:52.867 --> 00:45:55.801
I think you could be really,
really romantic.


746
00:45:55.803 --> 00:45:57.770
And also an opportunity
to kinda like...


747
00:45:59.005 --> 00:46:01.974
Find ourselves
and be adventurous.


748
00:46:01.976 --> 00:46:03.175
We rent an rv...

749
00:46:03.177 --> 00:46:04.510
-Can I drive?
-You can drive.


750
00:46:04.512 --> 00:46:05.644
Can we get matching hats?

751
00:46:05.646 --> 00:46:06.946
We can get matching hats.

752
00:46:07.347 --> 00:46:08.781
Laminated maps.

753
00:46:08.783 --> 00:46:10.616
We'll go from town to town,

754
00:46:10.618 --> 00:46:14.353
exploring things
and sleeping outside...


755
00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:15.654
Rapping by night.

756
00:46:15.656 --> 00:46:16.755
Rapping by night.

757
00:46:16.757 --> 00:46:19.024
-Adventuring during the day.
-Yes.


758
00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:20.659
We're gonna go looking
for hot Springs.


759
00:46:20.661 --> 00:46:23.963
Hot Springs and zip lining
and weird food...


760
00:46:23.965 --> 00:46:25.798
-And we can go
all over the country.
-Diarrhea


761
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.233
we'll see all our people.

762
00:46:27.235 --> 00:46:28.734
We'll see all our
favorite people.


763
00:46:28.736 --> 00:46:31.136
All our friends and people who
use to live here and moved away


764
00:46:31.138 --> 00:46:33.572
and Jessica and Jason
will come and visit us.


765
00:46:33.574 --> 00:46:35.741
It will be so magical.

766
00:46:37.944 --> 00:46:38.877
Don't you think?

767
00:46:42.115 --> 00:46:43.415
-Honey?
-What?


768
00:46:43.417 --> 00:46:45.684
If you don't want to do it,
we don't have to do it,


769
00:46:45.686 --> 00:46:47.886
I think it could
be really romantic.


770
00:46:49.155 --> 00:46:51.290
Now you listen to me,
you son of a bitch.


771
00:46:55.061 --> 00:46:58.664
This is the greatest thing
that's ever happened to us.


772
00:46:58.666 --> 00:47:00.099
-Honey.
-What?


773
00:47:00.101 --> 00:47:01.400
I got eggs on your beard.

774
00:47:01.402 --> 00:47:02.635
You got some eggs
on my beard?


775
00:47:02.637 --> 00:47:03.869
It's okay.

776
00:47:03.871 --> 00:47:05.871
It's okay, you know why?

777
00:47:06.539 --> 00:47:08.807
Honey that was really funny.

778
00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:13.712
But in all seriousness hon...

779
00:47:15.915 --> 00:47:17.650
You are...

780
00:47:17.652 --> 00:47:22.054
A brilliant planner,
you're a wonderful cook.


781
00:47:22.056 --> 00:47:23.922
-Sweetheart.
-You're the greatest...


782
00:47:24.624 --> 00:47:26.725
Rap artist I've ever known.

783
00:47:26.727 --> 00:47:28.727
It's the only true
thing you just said.


784
00:47:29.629 --> 00:47:33.365
And I think
it's time for me...


785
00:47:33.367 --> 00:47:36.068
To unveil my
anniversary surprise.


786
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:37.202
You didn't.

787
00:47:38.972 --> 00:47:40.306
I did.

788
00:47:40.308 --> 00:47:41.407
You didn't.

789
00:47:43.543 --> 00:47:44.977
I did.

790
00:47:47.013 --> 00:47:48.013
You didn't.

791
00:47:52.185 --> 00:47:53.319
I did.

792
00:47:56.723 --> 00:47:59.158
Watch the one eyebrow raise,
watch this happen.


793
00:48:00.593 --> 00:48:02.161
You're not doing it honey.

794
00:48:03.396 --> 00:48:05.431
There it is. Nailed it.

795
00:48:05.433 --> 00:48:07.099
Not at all.

796
00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:08.934
-Yes too.
-You have to do this, no.


797
00:48:10.537 --> 00:48:11.837
Did I do it?

798
00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:15.474
Well, now it's...
Try again with something else.


799
00:48:15.476 --> 00:48:17.776
I'm really sorry
i got egg on you, honey.


800
00:48:17.778 --> 00:48:19.712
It's a very sweet thing
after all these years


801
00:48:19.714 --> 00:48:21.714
you can still make
me laugh like that.


802
00:48:23.316 --> 00:48:24.983
-Twenty years.
-Twenty years.


803
00:48:26.853 --> 00:48:28.120
Let me give you
your surprise.


804
00:48:28.122 --> 00:48:30.289
Jim, did you really
do something?


805
00:48:30.957 --> 00:48:31.890
I did.

806
00:48:35.528 --> 00:48:36.462
Jim.

807
00:48:37.864 --> 00:48:40.332
Jim, Jim...

808
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:46.405
Jim, what are you doing?

809
00:49:08.395 --> 00:49:09.895
You're leaving me
here for Jesus?


810
00:49:09.897 --> 00:49:12.898
You know it.
Catholic school forever.


811
00:49:22.308 --> 00:49:23.509
That's so good.

812
00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:14.893
Hey, Mrs. Henderson

813
00:50:14.895 --> 00:50:16.562
hello Mr. Henderson.

814
00:50:18.765 --> 00:50:20.566
It's a very good present.

815
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:44.189
I'm okay.

816
00:50:45.658 --> 00:50:46.758
Okay?

817
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.093
I'm all right.

818
00:50:49.362 --> 00:50:50.429
I got this.

819
00:50:53.299 --> 00:50:55.567
I think our prom...

820
00:50:55.569 --> 00:50:58.437
Oh, it's really long song.

821
00:51:05.378 --> 00:51:08.514
Surprised, your attention
span lasts long enough.


822
00:51:08.516 --> 00:51:09.548
I know.

823
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:11.250
Song's damn good.

824
00:51:38.611 --> 00:51:39.511
Yeah, there it is.

825
00:51:43.082 --> 00:51:46.351
That was a very nice touch.

826
00:51:46.353 --> 00:51:47.519
What's next?

827
00:51:49.957 --> 00:51:51.223
Oh yeah!

828
00:51:54.694 --> 00:51:56.161
-Here...
-Let's go!


829
00:51:58.665 --> 00:52:01.400
Backwards, this is how.

830
00:52:49.816 --> 00:52:51.116
Yeah.

831
00:52:51.118 --> 00:52:52.217
Pop.

832
00:53:09.502 --> 00:53:11.470
Jump, jump.

833
00:53:28.554 --> 00:53:30.055
Yeah, okay.

834
00:53:30.556 --> 00:53:32.891
Enough with the moaning.

835
00:53:32.893 --> 00:53:34.893
Enough of that,
take it easy.


836
00:53:34.895 --> 00:53:37.596
You know I was kidding
when I was on the rock


837
00:53:37.598 --> 00:53:39.398
but seriously...

838
00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.235
I don't want to punch
anybody as long as you rub
my head I'm good.


839
00:53:48.542 --> 00:53:50.742
No, that means
it's ending don't
do that.


840
00:53:50.744 --> 00:53:53.845
Don't do that.
I don't want
it to be over. No!


841
00:53:53.847 --> 00:53:55.047
Yeah, that's
enough for you.


842
00:53:55.049 --> 00:53:56.748
-No it's not.
-I think it is.


843
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:57.816
Keep going.

844
00:53:57.818 --> 00:53:59.217
No, I'm not gonna
keep going, Jim.


845
00:53:59.219 --> 00:54:01.119
I've done this for you
like a million times,


846
00:54:01.121 --> 00:54:02.921
you've never done
it for me once.


847
00:54:02.923 --> 00:54:03.855
Not once.

848
00:54:03.857 --> 00:54:05.290
All right.

849
00:54:06.526 --> 00:54:07.626
Stretch it out.

850
00:54:07.628 --> 00:54:11.997
Are you kidding?
Could we please
get on with the rub?


851
00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:13.865
I've waited very
long time for this.


852
00:54:13.867 --> 00:54:16.902
You can't rush greatness, okay?
Take it easy, all right?


853
00:54:16.904 --> 00:54:18.370
If you want to experience

854
00:54:18.372 --> 00:54:20.505
the ancient art of phrenology,

855
00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:22.507
you really need to wait
and get that right.


856
00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:23.675
Come again?

857
00:54:23.677 --> 00:54:25.077
Okay, well if you had seen

858
00:54:25.079 --> 00:54:26.745
men at work the classic

859
00:54:26.747 --> 00:54:30.682
Charlie sheen, Emilio estevez
film, from 1990 you'd know.


860
00:54:30.684 --> 00:54:32.317
It's when you...

861
00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:34.586
You know feel and interpret
someones skull features


862
00:54:34.588 --> 00:54:37.756
and you kind of see
what's going on in there.
So I get up in here...


863
00:54:37.758 --> 00:54:39.524
And I say...

864
00:54:39.526 --> 00:54:42.494
See that knot right there that
says you're a terrible cook.


865
00:54:42.496 --> 00:54:43.662
Okay, you're shitty.

866
00:54:43.664 --> 00:54:45.063
Shut up.

867
00:54:45.665 --> 00:54:46.665
This...

868
00:54:48.334 --> 00:54:51.236
I'm getting this straight
from the skull features


869
00:54:51.238 --> 00:54:53.038
you are a lover of animals.

870
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:56.141
Yeah, you knew that already
because I told you


871
00:54:56.143 --> 00:54:57.843
that I run a dog rescue.

872
00:54:59.178 --> 00:55:00.612
Tell about your doggies.

873
00:55:00.614 --> 00:55:03.348
Haven't really heard you
talk about it much.


874
00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:05.450
It was Chris' idea actually.

875
00:55:05.452 --> 00:55:06.651
What's that?

876
00:55:06.653 --> 00:55:07.819
That I open the rescue.

877
00:55:10.723 --> 00:55:12.390
-That's cool.
-Yeah


878
00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:16.928
I love the idea of you
hanging out with...


879
00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:20.365
Little Freddy
like gray hounds.


880
00:55:20.367 --> 00:55:22.501
Taken care of them,
i miss Freddy.


881
00:55:24.437 --> 00:55:28.774
We don't really... we don't
do the gray hound thing.


882
00:55:28.776 --> 00:55:32.577
What do you mean? You're like
the gray hound queen.


883
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:35.280
Yeah they're just sitting around
they're not practical.


884
00:55:35.282 --> 00:55:37.415
Chris pointed out
and he's right


885
00:55:37.417 --> 00:55:38.617
that you know...

886
00:55:39.819 --> 00:55:41.419
We have lot
of special needs.


887
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:44.723
They take a lot of work,
we are a small organization


888
00:55:44.725 --> 00:55:46.691
and then it's manageable.

889
00:55:48.127 --> 00:55:49.394
I guess I just...

890
00:55:52.899 --> 00:55:55.801
You love gray hounds, I mean.

891
00:55:59.972 --> 00:56:01.273
Yes I do.

892
00:56:02.642 --> 00:56:03.842
-Yeah.
-Yeah.


893
00:56:05.745 --> 00:56:08.146
Always think of them
as people waring fur-coat.


894
00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:12.417
I know.

895
00:56:12.419 --> 00:56:14.820
I just always have felt
understood by them.


896
00:56:21.093 --> 00:56:22.394
That makes sense.

897
00:56:23.563 --> 00:56:25.864
I don't know they want
to be around people.


898
00:56:28.534 --> 00:56:32.637
I don't know, feel what they
feel I can't explain it, it's...


899
00:56:32.639 --> 00:56:34.206
I can tell that they know

900
00:56:34.208 --> 00:56:36.942
that being out
in the world is hard.


901
00:56:36.944 --> 00:56:38.743
Yeah.

902
00:56:38.745 --> 00:56:43.048
And they feel it and just want
to be like nuzzled up and...


903
00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:44.716
They want to make
you feel better.


904
00:56:44.718 --> 00:56:47.586
They have that instinct
of wanting to be close
and I don 't know.


905
00:56:49.956 --> 00:56:53.658
And you can take a gray hound
even with all of it's things


906
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:57.062
that come with owning
them or caring for them


907
00:56:57.064 --> 00:56:58.697
or rehabilitating them.

908
00:56:58.699 --> 00:57:02.367
You take the oldest,
neediest, most anxious,


909
00:57:02.369 --> 00:57:06.238
broken down gray hound
and if you take that dog
to the beach


910
00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.772
and you take off
his collar...


911
00:57:11.777 --> 00:57:14.212
He will just fucking run.

912
00:57:16.749 --> 00:57:17.782
Like he was still young.

913
00:57:17.784 --> 00:57:19.217
Yeah.

914
00:57:19.219 --> 00:57:21.319
Just tear down that beach.

915
00:57:21.321 --> 00:57:26.691
It's like sand flying
and tongue is hanging out
of his mouth and he's so...


916
00:57:28.561 --> 00:57:30.395
I don't know,
so beautiful.


917
00:57:36.636 --> 00:57:39.337
I think you should think
about working with gray hounds.


918
00:57:42.976 --> 00:57:43.975
Yeah.

919
00:58:36.262 --> 00:58:37.929
Decent amount
of stars tonight.


920
00:58:50.142 --> 00:58:51.476
Can I tell you something?

921
00:58:52.645 --> 00:58:53.578
Anything.

922
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:05.790
I've been taking
anti-depressants...


923
00:59:08.094 --> 00:59:09.461
For a while.

924
00:59:16.002 --> 00:59:17.502
I haven't told anyone.

925
00:59:18.137 --> 00:59:20.038
You know,
not even Chris.


926
00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:27.112
You know,
i don't know why...


927
00:59:30.282 --> 00:59:31.916
I feel so embarrassed...

928
00:59:33.719 --> 00:59:34.819
About taking them.

929
00:59:36.355 --> 00:59:40.125
And it's probably because
there's nothing you know,
there's nothing wrong


930
00:59:41.961 --> 00:59:42.994
with my life.

931
00:59:44.797 --> 00:59:45.897
I should be happy.

932
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:52.470
But there's this...

933
00:59:54.907 --> 00:59:55.840
Sadness...

934
00:59:57.910 --> 01:00:01.746
And I don't know where
it comes from.


935
01:00:05.651 --> 01:00:07.552
Well, I can
understand that.


936
01:00:10.222 --> 01:00:11.589
The drugs are...

937
01:00:12.892 --> 01:00:14.092
They're weird.

938
01:00:14.094 --> 01:00:16.327
They're...

939
01:00:16.329 --> 01:00:18.797
Literally haven't cried
in five years.


940
01:00:23.602 --> 01:00:27.472
Yeah I don't have that
particular problem myself.


941
01:00:37.716 --> 01:00:39.084
Can I ask
you something?


942
01:00:39.351 --> 01:00:40.718
Anything.

943
01:00:43.322 --> 01:00:45.056
Why don't you talk
to Chris about it?


944
01:00:54.366 --> 01:00:55.767
I don't know.

945
01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:01.840
There was a time when I...
I would have.


946
01:01:03.943 --> 01:01:07.412
But things, things are just
kind of changing


947
01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:10.482
they're just, changing now.

948
01:01:15.087 --> 01:01:16.921
How so?

949
01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:20.525
Bryce is off to college
and Theo is right behind him.


950
01:01:22.294 --> 01:01:25.697
Chris is almost 64 now.

951
01:01:25.965 --> 01:01:27.031
Wow!

952
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.033
What?

953
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:34.973
I mean I knew he was older
i didn't really think he
was that much older.


954
01:01:34.975 --> 01:01:36.808
Yeah well, you know.

955
01:01:38.677 --> 01:01:40.478
-It's not nothing.
-Yeah.


956
01:01:43.816 --> 01:01:45.049
I've loved...

957
01:01:46.051 --> 01:01:48.186
I've loved...

958
01:01:48.188 --> 01:01:51.055
Being a mom to those
kids you know.


959
01:01:51.057 --> 01:01:55.426
I just, I don't know
what it's going to be like


960
01:01:55.428 --> 01:01:58.963
when they're gone and sometimes
i look at Chris and I think...


961
01:02:00.232 --> 01:02:02.300
Oh, my god!

962
01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:06.404
Am I going to be taking care
of an elderly person soon?


963
01:02:06.406 --> 01:02:08.206
I knew it,
you know I knew it.


964
01:02:09.141 --> 01:02:10.975
Going in but somehow...

965
01:02:12.344 --> 01:02:16.080
Being faced with just the two
of us alone in the house.


966
01:02:17.983 --> 01:02:19.017
I don't know.

967
01:02:19.019 --> 01:02:20.051
It's real now.

968
01:02:20.053 --> 01:02:21.719
-Yeah.
-I get it.


969
01:02:29.028 --> 01:02:30.562
-Hey.
-Hey, what?


970
01:02:32.464 --> 01:02:34.265
You know, I want to say
thank you.


971
01:02:35.234 --> 01:02:36.801
Why, what for?

972
01:02:39.238 --> 01:02:40.171
For tonight.

973
01:02:43.709 --> 01:02:47.178
For remembering
my pink and purple jelly beans


974
01:02:49.982 --> 01:02:50.915
you know.

975
01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:56.688
For never making
me feel, wrong...


976
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:59.691
About who I am.

977
01:03:07.433 --> 01:03:08.566
What?

978
01:03:10.002 --> 01:03:10.835
I just...

979
01:03:10.837 --> 01:03:11.903
You're embarrassed
on my behalf.


980
01:03:11.905 --> 01:03:14.572
No, just had a though
and it's...


981
01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:15.707
What?

982
01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:17.575
Nothing, no really...

983
01:03:17.577 --> 01:03:21.379
I just told you something
that I never told anyone
and I thing you should...


984
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.081
I was thinking about...

985
01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:25.817
Our first time.

986
01:03:27.453 --> 01:03:30.021
In the back of this truck.
At the lake.


987
01:03:33.626 --> 01:03:35.226
All 38 seconds of it.

988
01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:39.731
Oh, shut up.
I was excited.
I was sixteen, okay?


989
01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:43.301
I've developed some
serious skills


990
01:03:43.303 --> 01:03:48.006
since then, in fact I've been
servicing the entire Tucson,
Arizona area...


991
01:03:48.874 --> 01:03:50.708
-With...
-What are you, a plumber?


992
01:03:58.717 --> 01:04:00.218
It's funny though 'cause...

993
01:04:05.924 --> 01:04:08.259
Never really been
like it was with us.


994
01:04:10.095 --> 01:04:11.062
For me.

995
01:04:18.604 --> 01:04:20.071
You know,
that's a nostalgia thing.


996
01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:20.872
Yeah.

997
01:04:20.874 --> 01:04:22.807
-So it's...
-Yeah.


998
01:04:32.151 --> 01:04:33.418
This is same for me.

999
01:04:45.964 --> 01:04:47.732
-Really?
-Yeah.


1000
01:04:50.769 --> 01:04:52.737
It's something about
those dumb kids.


1001
01:04:53.439 --> 01:04:54.505
Yeah.

1002
01:04:54.507 --> 01:04:56.341
-Pain is something.
-Yeah.


1003
01:04:58.077 --> 01:04:59.077
Magic.

1004
01:04:59.079 --> 01:05:00.678
It's magic,
yeah that's right.


1005
01:05:08.554 --> 01:05:09.587
Jim?

1006
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:10.788
Yeah.

1007
01:05:15.494 --> 01:05:16.928
Will you kiss me.

1008
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.440
I know what I'm asking for...

1009
01:05:57.436 --> 01:05:58.770
I love you.

1010
01:06:17.956 --> 01:06:18.890
No.

1011
01:06:49.788 --> 01:06:51.322
I have to go Jim.

1012
01:06:54.927 --> 01:06:56.461
-Amanda.
-Jim, please.


1013
01:06:57.463 --> 01:06:58.596
Listen, I don't want
you to go.


1014
01:06:58.598 --> 01:06:59.831
Please!

1015
01:06:59.833 --> 01:07:01.666
Please, will you just please
give me a minute.


1016
01:07:01.668 --> 01:07:02.867
Okay, listen.

1017
01:07:02.869 --> 01:07:05.236
It's confusing I get it,
okay I just want...


1018
01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:06.170
We can talk about it.

1019
01:07:06.172 --> 01:07:07.538
I don't want
to talk about it.


1020
01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.840
I don't want
to talk about it.


1021
01:07:08.842 --> 01:07:10.842
I should not have let
this game go on for so long.


1022
01:07:10.844 --> 01:07:12.243
This is not a game
to me though.


1023
01:07:12.245 --> 01:07:13.878
Do you understand
that I am married?


1024
01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.846
I understand.

1025
01:07:14.848 --> 01:07:15.813
Do you know
what that means?


1026
01:07:15.815 --> 01:07:18.182
I belong
to someone else


1027
01:07:18.184 --> 01:07:21.486
Will you please give me
a little bit of room.


1028
01:07:23.188 --> 01:07:24.889
Fuck is my coat?

1029
01:07:39.872 --> 01:07:41.205
Where did you get this?

1030
01:07:46.378 --> 01:07:47.545
It was in your closet.

1031
01:07:50.249 --> 01:07:51.282
You just took it?

1032
01:07:55.554 --> 01:07:56.487
Yeah.

1033
01:07:58.991 --> 01:07:59.824
Why?

1034
01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:01.325
Well, it's addressed to me.

1035
01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:02.260
First of all.

1036
01:08:02.961 --> 01:08:04.228
And second of all

1037
01:08:06.398 --> 01:08:07.965
I wanted to read it.

1038
01:08:07.967 --> 01:08:09.667
Well this is just
a game to you, Amanda


1039
01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:12.537
then why do you need
to read a letter that I wrote
to you 22 years ago?


1040
01:08:12.539 --> 01:08:15.172
What is this...
What could this
possibly mean to you?


1041
01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:16.974
You know,
i don't know.


1042
01:08:16.976 --> 01:08:18.442
I just wanted
to read it.


1043
01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:22.780
This is my letter.

1044
01:08:22.782 --> 01:08:24.115
-I know that and I'm sorr...
-No


1045
01:08:24.117 --> 01:08:26.284
I don't think you
understand that.


1046
01:08:26.286 --> 01:08:29.453
I think you need
to understand something
that this is my letter.


1047
01:08:29.455 --> 01:08:31.722
Okay, this belongs to me.

1048
01:08:31.724 --> 01:08:33.524
And you can't come
into my house,


1049
01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.127
and just take this

1050
01:08:36.129 --> 01:08:38.329
and do what ever
you want with it,


1051
01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:40.064
without asking me,

1052
01:08:40.066 --> 01:08:41.933
because it's mine too.

1053
01:08:42.467 --> 01:08:43.634
You understand me?

1054
01:08:45.671 --> 01:08:46.771
What is this?

1055
01:08:46.773 --> 01:08:48.573
That was my baby too.

1056
01:08:48.575 --> 01:08:51.208
Okay? It was ours.

1057
01:08:52.411 --> 01:08:53.411
What...

1058
01:08:53.413 --> 01:08:54.679
It was ours.

1059
01:08:55.782 --> 01:08:57.181
You just fucking...

1060
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:59.483
Why did you?

1061
01:09:01.653 --> 01:09:03.054
Fucking!

1062
01:09:09.094 --> 01:09:10.261
Why did you do that?

1063
01:09:10.263 --> 01:09:11.228
Jim?

1064
01:09:11.964 --> 01:09:13.664
Why did you do that?

1065
01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:17.602
You...

1066
01:09:17.604 --> 01:09:19.070
I was a scared kid!

1067
01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:20.805
I didn't know
how to handle it.


1068
01:09:20.807 --> 01:09:22.206
You had to give me
a minute.


1069
01:09:22.208 --> 01:09:23.541
You fuckin' went away.

1070
01:09:23.543 --> 01:09:26.210
You were the one who told me
that we were too young.


1071
01:09:26.212 --> 01:09:29.347
I was scared.
Why did you fucking do it?


1072
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:30.815
It was our life!

1073
01:09:36.321 --> 01:09:37.288
Boy!

1074
01:09:40.892 --> 01:09:42.593
When we were so happy.

1075
01:09:50.802 --> 01:09:52.503
We lost it.

1076
01:09:52.505 --> 01:09:53.971
We lost everything.

1077
01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.273
Jim.

1078
01:10:06.385 --> 01:10:07.318
Fuck!

1079
01:10:29.941 --> 01:10:31.208
Oh god!

1080
01:10:32.611 --> 01:10:34.412
Breath.

1081
01:10:37.616 --> 01:10:38.749
Okay.

1082
01:10:43.288 --> 01:10:45.256
Take a deep
breath please.


1083
01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:48.025
I'm sorry.

1084
01:10:48.027 --> 01:10:49.560
I'm sorry too.

1085
01:10:49.562 --> 01:10:50.861
I'm really sorry.

1086
01:10:50.863 --> 01:10:52.396
I'm really sorry too.

1087
01:12:51.917 --> 01:12:52.850
Okay.

1088
01:12:55.353 --> 01:12:57.388
I need you
to understand something.


1089
01:12:59.424 --> 01:13:03.160
I didn't just irrationally make
the decision to do what I did.


1090
01:13:04.029 --> 01:13:06.063
And I know...

1091
01:13:06.065 --> 01:13:08.833
I see now that it was
incredibly hard on you.


1092
01:13:11.002 --> 01:13:14.538
But I was the one who had to go
in there and actually do it.


1093
01:13:15.473 --> 01:13:17.274
Actually go through with it.

1094
01:13:17.843 --> 01:13:18.776
You know?

1095
01:13:20.445 --> 01:13:24.215
And I do get that I didn't
handle it well, I didn't...


1096
01:13:29.254 --> 01:13:32.423
I just... I tortured myself.

1097
01:13:32.425 --> 01:13:36.460
Going over the options,
alone in my bedroom.


1098
01:13:36.462 --> 01:13:39.763
Going over and over,
what I should do.


1099
01:13:42.067 --> 01:13:44.602
And then you sent me
that stupid note.


1100
01:13:46.404 --> 01:13:50.941
Making all those weird,
sarcastic jokes and...


1101
01:13:53.578 --> 01:13:58.449
And then you sent me
that stupid get well soon
balloon, a balloon, Jim.


1102
01:14:04.422 --> 01:14:06.457
I don't know there
was something about it where


1103
01:14:06.459 --> 01:14:09.693
it became so clear to me
that you were too young...


1104
01:14:10.161 --> 01:14:11.195
To handle it.

1105
01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:14.465
We were too
young to handle it.


1106
01:14:14.467 --> 01:14:18.002
And I knew that I was gonna
have to go through it alone
and I knew I couldn't,


1107
01:14:18.937 --> 01:14:19.570
do it alone.

1108
01:14:22.941 --> 01:14:23.941
And you know...

1109
01:14:27.746 --> 01:14:30.347
Do I have regrets? Yes.

1110
01:14:30.949 --> 01:14:31.882
Yes.

1111
01:14:33.652 --> 01:14:34.852
But...

1112
01:14:37.322 --> 01:14:38.589
What can we do?

1113
01:14:39.457 --> 01:14:40.591
Here.

1114
01:14:42.894 --> 01:14:46.530
Please. You just read it now.

1115
01:14:59.778 --> 01:15:05.316
"Amanda, I know we can
get through this together.


1116
01:15:07.752 --> 01:15:09.053
You are my world.

1117
01:15:11.022 --> 01:15:12.823
I will never
stop loving you."


1118
01:15:15.794 --> 01:15:17.962
It was the first version
that I wrote to you.


1119
01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:27.071
Why didn't you
send this to me?


1120
01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:30.874
I was scared.

1121
01:15:34.379 --> 01:15:37.648
It was just stupid.
I'm sorry.


1122
01:16:16.354 --> 01:16:17.921
I'm contagious.

1123
01:16:17.923 --> 01:16:19.456
Apparently.

1124
01:16:32.303 --> 01:16:34.772
Now it's just
never gonna stop.
