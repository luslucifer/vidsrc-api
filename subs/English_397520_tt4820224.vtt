1
00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.789
Give me that.

2
00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:49.549
Good morning, Rachel.
How are you?


3
00:01:49.668 --> 00:01:51.029
You know me, I'm not a complainer.

4
00:01:51.268 --> 00:01:52.308
Goes without saying.

5
00:01:52.548 --> 00:01:54.069
But my old bursitis
has been acting up.


6
00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:56.388
And I've got that tingling
in my hands again.


7
00:01:56.628 --> 00:01:59.308
Never mind I haven't had
a decent sleep in weeks.


8
00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:01.748
But why go on.
- Indeed.


9
00:02:02.068 --> 00:02:03.484
Your brother not feeling
social again?


10
00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:05.788
No, Matthew has a very special
chore this morning.


11
00:02:06.308 --> 00:02:09.548
All right now, Harry. We got
some important business today.


12
00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:11.548
So I need you on
your best behavior.


13
00:02:11.987 --> 00:02:13.107
There you go, good boy.

14
00:02:13.347 --> 00:02:14.347
Abner!

15
00:02:14.587 --> 00:02:16.587
Abner, you're gonna run...
Come back here!


16
00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:18.443
Abner, I don't have time
to fool with you.


17
00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.627
Abner! Come here!

18
00:02:22.147 --> 00:02:23.147
Come here!

19
00:02:23.427 --> 00:02:25.427
Abner, I'm not in the mood.

20
00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:29.667
Hey, you little runner!
Get back here. Abner!


21
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.347
Get outta there!

22
00:02:31.747 --> 00:02:32.787
Abner!

23
00:02:44.307 --> 00:02:46.107
Lord, give me strength.

24
00:02:46.827 --> 00:02:48.947
Matthew! You're supposed to be
at the station.


25
00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:50.907
I know! I had an accident.

26
00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:52.483
What's happened?
Are you all right?


27
00:02:52.507 --> 00:02:54.107
I'm happy as a pet crow.

28
00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:57.867
You see, that is exactly why
we're doing what we're doing.


29
00:02:58.107 --> 00:03:00.146
Lord. You're supposed to be
there already.


30
00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:02.306
Please, stop fustling. I'm...

31
00:03:02.546 --> 00:03:04.402
From now on, things are gonna be
different around here.


32
00:03:04.426 --> 00:03:07.466
Go on, change all your clothes.
It's disgusting.


33
00:03:19.186 --> 00:03:20.706
Hello, Rachel!

34
00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:23.746
I doozy up pretty good,
don't you think?


35
00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:38.666
- An orphan? You can't be serious.
- We are.


36
00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:40.427
What in heaven's name
are you thinking?


37
00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:42.146
Matthew needs some help
with chores.


38
00:03:42.386 --> 00:03:44.322
Dorothy Spencer said
she was going down to Hopetown...


39
00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:46.761
...to get herself a girl. We asked
her to bring us back a boy.


40
00:03:46.785 --> 00:03:48.985
But an orphan, really?
Are you sure?


41
00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.001
We aim to give him a good home.
Good education.


42
00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:53.586
But you don't know anything about
him. He might be a gypsy child.


43
00:03:53.665 --> 00:03:54.785
Or worse.
- Rachel!


44
00:03:55.065 --> 00:03:57.065
Just last week I read in the paper
about a boy...


45
00:03:57.305 --> 00:03:59.561
...who set fire to the house.
Nearly burnt the poor couple...


46
00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:00.665
...to a crisp.
- Rachel!


47
00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:03.705
And there was another one. A girl.
She took a rifle...


48
00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:06.545
...and shot the whole family.
Then she slit their throats...


49
00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:08.465
...with a bread knife.
Even the baby.


50
00:04:08.945 --> 00:04:11.505
I were you I'd keep
my bedroom door locked.


51
00:04:11.745 --> 00:04:13.745
And a knife under my pillow.

52
00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:17.905
We're not getting a girl.

53
00:04:19.305 --> 00:04:20.545
We're getting a boy.

54
00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:24.505
Hello?

55
00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:29.385
Edwin. The twelve-thirty
come through?


56
00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:31.065
Right on time, Matthew.

57
00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:33.384
Exactly one hour
and four minutes ago.


58
00:04:33.624 --> 00:04:36.664
Well, I... Never mind.
We're excepting a youngster.


59
00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:38.744
Came in with Mrs. Spencer.

60
00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:42.944
Where about?

61
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:44.241
Outside.

62
00:04:55.544 --> 00:04:56.584
Hello?

63
00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:01.464
That's a girl outside. A girl.
- Most girls are.


64
00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:03.664
We're expecting a boy.
Where is he?


65
00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:06.642
- Must've been a mix-up.
- We asked for a boy.


66
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:09.491
- Maybe they're fresh out.
- Edmond, please.


67
00:05:10.304 --> 00:05:12.624
Are you Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of
Green Gables?


68
00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:16.784
Yes, I am.

69
00:05:17.204 --> 00:05:19.643
How do you do?
My name is Anne Shirley.


70
00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.559
And this is for you.

71
00:05:24.543 --> 00:05:26.820
I was beginning to fear something
terrible had happened.


72
00:05:26.886 --> 00:05:28.846
So I made up my mind if you didn't
come for me...


73
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.282
...I'd climb up into some tree
and stay up there all night.


74
00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:34.223
It would be lovely to sleep
in a tree.


75
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:36.841
Wild, crooked, white with bloom.

76
00:05:37.263 --> 00:05:40.023
Can you imagine in the moonlight
how it would look?


77
00:05:40.263 --> 00:05:41.303
Well...

78
00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:44.183
Did you come in a wagon?

79
00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:46.743
Yes, I do.

80
00:05:47.943 --> 00:05:49.623
No, that's all right.

81
00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:53.704
It's not heavy. Besides, if it
isn't carried in a certain way...


82
00:05:53.823 --> 00:05:54.943
...the handle pulls out.

83
00:05:55.183 --> 00:05:57.823
So I'd better hang onto it because
I know the exact knack of it.


84
00:06:02.103 --> 00:06:03.583
Best to Marilla.

85
00:06:08.902 --> 00:06:11.302
This island is even more
wondrous than I imagined.


86
00:06:11.542 --> 00:06:13.422
And I can tell you
that's saying quite a lot.


87
00:06:14.342 --> 00:06:16.382
Are there trees
around Green Gables?


88
00:06:17.062 --> 00:06:20.582
I adore trees. There were
some at the orphanage...


89
00:06:20.822 --> 00:06:22.062
...but they were scrawny.

90
00:06:22.302 --> 00:06:24.422
By any chance,
is there a babbling brook?


91
00:06:24.662 --> 00:06:27.142
Yes. Just a look and a half
from the house.


92
00:06:27.382 --> 00:06:28.422
Really?

93
00:06:28.662 --> 00:06:30.823
It's always been one of
my dreams to live near a brook.


94
00:06:30.982 --> 00:06:32.782
I never expected I would, though.

95
00:06:35.222 --> 00:06:38.062
Mr. Cuthbert, why is the earth red?

96
00:06:38.902 --> 00:06:41.622
Well now, that's a fair question.

97
00:06:41.862 --> 00:06:46.062
I don't...
I don't exactly know why.


98
00:06:47.342 --> 00:06:50.462
Well now, that's something else
to find out about one day.


99
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:55.261
Look, do you see
that colorful bird?


100
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:57.061
Where?

101
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:58.701
You see, up there!

102
00:07:03.301 --> 00:07:04.781
Mr. Cuthbert?

103
00:07:05.221 --> 00:07:08.501
Who was Prince Edward? Was he
a real prince or make-believe?


104
00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:11.101
Prince Edward...

105
00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:13.701
No matter, it's all the same to me.

106
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:15.661
And something else
to find out about.


107
00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:18.301
Isn't it just splendid to think
of all the things...


108
00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:19.782
...there are to find out about?

109
00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:21.542
It wouldn't be half
so interesting...


110
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:24.021
...if we knew everything
about everything, would it?


111
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:26.861
No, I suppose not

112
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.660
What is that sound?

113
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.900
Spring peepers.

114
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.700
They are little tiny frogs.
Right down there in Barry's Pond.


115
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.180
Barry's Pond?

116
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.540
No, that's much too plain.

117
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.900
It should be something
glorious and romantic like...


118
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.340
I know!

119
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.939
Lake of Shining Waters.

120
00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:29.619
Shining Waters, huh?

121
00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:34.339
Our brook flows
right the way down into it.


122
00:08:36.619 --> 00:08:39.619
I'm sorry. Sometimes I dream
when I'm wide awake.


123
00:08:39.859 --> 00:08:41.179
Do you ever do that?

124
00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:43.179
Not lately.

125
00:08:43.939 --> 00:08:47.619
I love dreaming, even though I know
they don't always come true.


126
00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:50.299
Right now I'm so near
perfectly happy I can't tell...


127
00:08:50.539 --> 00:08:52.739
...if I'm dreaming or not.
- Well now...


128
00:08:52.979 --> 00:08:55.819
Listen, Miss Anne. You know,
my sister Marilla...


129
00:08:56.059 --> 00:08:57.780
But what's so terrible is
I can't ever be...


130
00:08:57.939 --> 00:08:59.859
...perfectly happy because...

131
00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:03.579
What color would you
call this hair?


132
00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:05.419
Well, I would say it's red.

133
00:09:05.819 --> 00:09:07.899
But there are other colors
in there too.


134
00:09:08.499 --> 00:09:09.779
Exactly.

135
00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:11.700
Nobody who has hair
this horrible...


136
00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:13.419
...could possibly ever be
perfectly happy.


137
00:09:14.098 --> 00:09:16.138
It will be my lifelong sorrow.

138
00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:19.338
Am I talking too much?

139
00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.218
People always tell me I do.
And I know I embellish...


140
00:09:22.498 --> 00:09:24.138
...and I know
that's not proper but...


141
00:09:25.178 --> 00:09:27.658
There I go again.
Would you rather I didn't speak?


142
00:09:28.138 --> 00:09:29.738
Guess I don't mind.

143
00:09:33.858 --> 00:09:37.218
Just that the bottom of this hill,
just past the trees...


144
00:09:37.698 --> 00:09:39.338
...you can see Green Gables.

145
00:10:03.897 --> 00:10:06.257
It's exactly as I imagined it.

146
00:10:20.217 --> 00:10:22.697
Thank heavens. I thought you
must have crashed in a ditch...


147
00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:27.257
No.

148
00:10:27.497 --> 00:10:29.097
What's the meaning of this?

149
00:10:30.017 --> 00:10:31.737
- Now, Marilla...
- That's not a boy.


150
00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:33.457
You're not a boy.

151
00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:35.377
If you'll just let me explain...

152
00:10:35.617 --> 00:10:37.818
I told Mrs. Spencer to bring us
a boy. I was very clear.


153
00:10:37.897 --> 00:10:39.777
I said bring us a boy about
eleven years old.


154
00:10:40.017 --> 00:10:41.937
Well, I guess they just
didn't have one.


155
00:10:43.137 --> 00:10:45.497
Some pretty piece of
business this is.


156
00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:47.616
What are we supposed to do
with her?


157
00:10:49.136 --> 00:10:52.016
I couldn't just leave her all alone
at the station.


158
00:11:00.696 --> 00:11:02.776
You don't want me
because I'm not a boy?


159
00:11:05.176 --> 00:11:07.337
I might have known it was all
too beautiful to be true.


160
00:11:07.576 --> 00:11:09.976
Calm now, child. There's no reason
to cry so about it.


161
00:11:10.216 --> 00:11:12.696
Yes, there is a need.
This is the most tragic thing...


162
00:11:12.936 --> 00:11:14.576
...that ever happened to me.

163
00:11:15.496 --> 00:11:19.536
God, child. We're not going to turn
you out of doors tonight. Here.


164
00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:25.936
What's your name?

165
00:11:28.656 --> 00:11:31.616
If you please, would you call me
Cordelia?


166
00:11:32.016 --> 00:11:33.895
It's such a perfectly
elegant name.


167
00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:37.935
Your name is Cordelia?

168
00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:42.775
Not exactly.

169
00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:48.455
What is it? Tell me the truth.

170
00:11:48.975 --> 00:11:50.295
Anne Shirley.

171
00:11:50.775 --> 00:11:53.015
You see what I mean?
Two first names put together?


172
00:11:53.255 --> 00:11:55.511
It stands out something awful
and if I'm starting all over...


173
00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:56.871
...Cordelia would be my preference.

174
00:11:56.895 --> 00:11:59.935
Fiddlesticks to all that. Anne is
a real good plain and simple name.


175
00:12:00.175 --> 00:12:01.616
You've no reason to be
ashamed of it.


176
00:12:01.735 --> 00:12:04.495
I'm not ashamed of it. Only I like
Cordelia so much better.


177
00:12:05.175 --> 00:12:06.591
But if you must call me Anne,
would you call me...


178
00:12:06.615 --> 00:12:09.015
...the kind of Anne that's spelled
with an "e" at the end.


179
00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:13.375
Give me that.

180
00:12:24.454 --> 00:12:25.574
Lilacs.

181
00:12:35.654 --> 00:12:37.374
Ambrosia.

182
00:12:39.374 --> 00:12:41.014
What a pretty path.

183
00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:42.934
We call that The Avenue.

184
00:12:44.374 --> 00:12:45.614
Avenue?

185
00:12:46.334 --> 00:12:49.334
That name doesn't do it justice.
I know.


186
00:12:50.494 --> 00:12:54.374
I'm going to call it
The White Way of Delight.


187
00:12:57.334 --> 00:12:59.654
A magical place like this always
gives me a q... r...


188
00:12:59.894 --> 00:13:02.134
...funny sort of ache. In here.

189
00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.390
Did you ever have an ache
like that, Miss Cuthbert?


190
00:13:05.414 --> 00:13:07.133
Not that I recall. Come along.

191
00:13:07.373 --> 00:13:09.093
We'll sort all this out
in the morning.


192
00:13:20.373 --> 00:13:23.693
Come along. This way.
Keep going.


193
00:13:24.493 --> 00:13:25.893
Right upstairs.

194
00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:34.813
Now, Harry, what do you think,
old friend?


195
00:13:38.493 --> 00:13:41.253
Yeah. No, she is not a boy.
And she is a talker but...


196
00:13:41.773 --> 00:13:43.453
...she is really interesting.

197
00:13:44.253 --> 00:13:45.773
Gotta we met that, huh?

198
00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:50.733
Abner, you're the cause of
all my troubles today.


199
00:13:50.973 --> 00:13:52.613
What've you got to say
for yourself?


200
00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:56.892
I'll accept your apology.

201
00:13:57.772 --> 00:13:59.732
Alright, Harry, let's get
you ready for bed.


202
00:14:10.452 --> 00:14:12.452
Come now, child.
You haven't eaten a thing.


203
00:14:13.492 --> 00:14:16.532
Can you eat when you're
in the depths of despair?


204
00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:19.252
I've never been in the depths of
despair so I wouldn't know.


205
00:14:21.172 --> 00:14:25.292
Haven't you ever try to imagine
you were in the depths of despair?


206
00:14:25.812 --> 00:14:28.052
Why on earth would I wanna
do thing like that?


207
00:14:28.692 --> 00:14:31.492
I can assure you,
it's a very unpleasant feeling.


208
00:14:32.052 --> 00:14:34.772
When you try to eat, a lump
comes right up in your throat...


209
00:14:34.972 --> 00:14:36.972
...and you can't swallow
anything.


210
00:14:37.732 --> 00:14:41.451
Not even if it was
a chocolate caramel.


211
00:14:44.371 --> 00:14:45.851
She must be tired.

212
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:48.211
I suppose, it could be
all the travel.


213
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:10.251
Quick-quick. Into bed.

214
00:15:12.371 --> 00:15:14.091
I need to blow out the oil lamp.

215
00:15:14.731 --> 00:15:16.891
That's all right, I can
blow out my own lamp.


216
00:15:17.531 --> 00:15:18.931
That'll be the day.

217
00:15:24.331 --> 00:15:25.571
Marilla...

218
00:15:26.731 --> 00:15:29.290
Do I truly have to leave
tomorrow?


219
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.810
I'll sort that out in the morning.

220
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.050
Good night, then.

221
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.930
This is what comes of sending word
instead of going ourselves.


222
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.570
Can you imagine how my message
could have gotten so twisted?


223
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.290
In any case, she has to
go back to the orphanage.


224
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.450
What is "hmmm" mean?
You don't agree?


225
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.730
She seems like a real sweet child.

226
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.890
Pity to send her back
when she's so set on staying.


227
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.450
- You're not thinking...
- No, I suppose not.


228
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.289
We don't need an orphan girl.
If I did, I'm not sure she is...


229
00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:19.570
...the one I'd pick out.
And there's something else.


230
00:16:19.809 --> 00:16:20.889
What's that?

231
00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:24.289
There's something about her
I don't understand.


232
00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:26.929
No, she's to go back.

233
00:16:27.169 --> 00:16:29.505
I'll go into town first thing
in the morning and take care of it.


234
00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:31.889
- Wait till after chores.
- What on earth for?


235
00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:35.609
There's a chance to spend some time
with her, get to know her.


236
00:16:36.089 --> 00:16:37.689
What good would that do?

237
00:16:38.929 --> 00:16:40.369
For you, not much.

238
00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:43.289
For the child, though
it could mean something.


239
00:16:45.369 --> 00:16:48.529
Just like you to get a whim
and cling on to it.


240
00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:50.409
You're not better than
an overgrown boy.


241
00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:53.009
All right, I'm off to bed now.
Good night.


242
00:17:54.367 --> 00:17:55.887
Give me that.

243
00:18:55.406 --> 00:18:57.006
I'm sure hungry this morning.

244
00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:01.966
The world doesn't seem
such a howling wilderness...


245
00:19:02.206 --> 00:19:03.766
...as it did last night.

246
00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:07.966
It's always better...

247
00:19:09.006 --> 00:19:10.927
...to be cheerful and bear up
under affliction...


248
00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:12.166
...on a sunshiny day.

249
00:19:12.406 --> 00:19:14.686
For pity's sake,
will you stop talking?


250
00:19:14.926 --> 00:19:16.966
You talk quite a lot
for a little girl.


251
00:19:18.806 --> 00:19:21.365
- I'll be quiet now.
- That's a relief.


252
00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:25.205
Marilla?

253
00:19:27.685 --> 00:19:29.005
Good morning Miss Anne.

254
00:19:29.605 --> 00:19:30.925
Hello Matthew.

255
00:19:33.565 --> 00:19:35.405
Should I hitch up Harry?

256
00:19:38.165 --> 00:19:39.805
I'll go this afternoon.

257
00:19:45.925 --> 00:19:48.645
Now, young lady, I expect to
help me with the chores...


258
00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:50.725
...when you finished with all that.

259
00:19:57.525 --> 00:19:59.125
Lord help us all.

260
00:20:00.605 --> 00:20:02.325
Now, watch your step,
it's slick in here.


261
00:20:03.085 --> 00:20:04.405
You familiar with animals?

262
00:20:04.645 --> 00:20:07.645
No, not at all but I've made up
my mind to enjoy this experience.


263
00:20:07.885 --> 00:20:10.020
I believe it will make me a better
and more rounded person.


264
00:20:10.044 --> 00:20:11.084
I see.

265
00:20:11.364 --> 00:20:12.940
I believe you can enjoy
nearly anything...


266
00:20:12.964 --> 00:20:14.180
...if you make up your mind to.

267
00:20:14.204 --> 00:20:16.484
Look, that little pig is so pink.

268
00:20:16.724 --> 00:20:19.204
Imagine being born bright pink.

269
00:20:19.444 --> 00:20:21.764
It's the most bewitching color.
But I can't wear it.


270
00:20:22.004 --> 00:20:25.324
Redheads can't wear pink.
Another hope dashed to the ground.


271
00:20:25.564 --> 00:20:28.724
My life is a perfect graveyard of
buried hopes.


272
00:20:31.884 --> 00:20:33.364
All right, come over here.

273
00:20:34.644 --> 00:20:36.124
Sit down on the stool, come on.

274
00:20:37.044 --> 00:20:38.044
It's alright.

275
00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:40.044
There you go.

276
00:20:40.604 --> 00:20:41.924
There you got the pail.

277
00:20:42.964 --> 00:20:45.844
Okay. All right.

278
00:20:47.324 --> 00:20:48.604
What's that called?

279
00:20:48.844 --> 00:20:51.324
This is called an udder.
And these are the teats.


280
00:20:51.524 --> 00:20:54.804
What you do is squeeze and pull.

281
00:20:55.043 --> 00:20:56.043
Okay, you try it.

282
00:20:57.083 --> 00:20:58.563
Come on, they don't bite.

283
00:20:59.643 --> 00:21:01.043
Just...

284
00:21:02.403 --> 00:21:03.843
There you go.

285
00:21:04.483 --> 00:21:06.083
I imagine you grew up in a city.

286
00:21:06.323 --> 00:21:09.043
Yeah. Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.

287
00:21:10.723 --> 00:21:12.403
You happen to know your parents?

288
00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:16.443
Yes, Walter und Bertha.
Aren't they lovely names?


289
00:21:17.003 --> 00:21:19.163
I'm so glad they had
such nice names.


290
00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:20.939
It would be a shame
to have a father named...


291
00:21:20.963 --> 00:21:22.459
...something like Jedediah,
wouldn't it?


292
00:21:22.483 --> 00:21:25.443
Nonsense. A name isn't important,
it's how a person behaves.


293
00:21:25.923 --> 00:21:29.443
I read in a book once, a rose by
any other name smells as sweet.


294
00:21:29.843 --> 00:21:31.923
But I can't believe it.
What do you think?


295
00:21:32.123 --> 00:21:34.123
Haven't given that
a lot of thought.


296
00:21:34.723 --> 00:21:36.523
There you go, you're getting
the knack of it.


297
00:21:37.043 --> 00:21:38.523
Do you mind me asking you...

298
00:21:39.043 --> 00:21:40.763
...what happened to
Walter and Bertha?


299
00:21:41.003 --> 00:21:42.922
Both died of fever
when I was five years old.


300
00:21:43.162 --> 00:21:45.483
Town folks were at their wits end
about what to do with me.


301
00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:48.442
So Mrs. Thomas down the road
took me.


302
00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:52.802
Though she was poor and
had an emotional husband.


303
00:21:58.922 --> 00:22:00.762
But when he wasn't unhappy
about things...


304
00:22:00.962 --> 00:22:02.682
...he was very clever
with checkers.


305
00:22:03.162 --> 00:22:05.082
They had four children
younger than me.


306
00:22:05.322 --> 00:22:07.722
That was my job.
Looking after the children.


307
00:22:07.922 --> 00:22:11.042
Go ahead. Just go in. Don't step on
anyone. Go on through.


308
00:22:11.602 --> 00:22:12.922
There you go.

309
00:22:14.882 --> 00:22:16.042
There you go.

310
00:22:18.202 --> 00:22:19.322
All right.

311
00:22:22.402 --> 00:22:23.802
There's stuff on them!

312
00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:25.282
It's only stuff!

313
00:22:27.282 --> 00:22:30.561
And then Mr. Thomas died falling
under a train...


314
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:33.081
...and I ended up
in my first orphan home.


315
00:22:38.521 --> 00:22:39.801
And then what happened?

316
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:44.281
Then Mrs. Hammond from up
the river came and...


317
00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:48.641
...said she'd take me, seeing I
was handy with children.


318
00:22:50.041 --> 00:22:52.841
Mrs. Hammond had twins three times.

319
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:57.641
I like babies in moderation, but
twins three times in succession.


320
00:22:58.001 --> 00:22:59.801
In my opinion,
that's over the limit.


321
00:23:00.721 --> 00:23:02.201
And what happened to Mr. Hammond?

322
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:05.641
Mr. Hammond died and Mrs. Hammond
couldn't cope with life anymore...


323
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:08.921
...so I ended up at the orphanage
at Hopetown.


324
00:23:10.081 --> 00:23:12.161
The one with Mrs. Carlyle.

325
00:23:14.601 --> 00:23:17.800
You'll obey my rules or be sent
to the work house.


326
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.440
But, Anne, these women...

327
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.400
...Mrs. Hammond, Mrs. Carlyle,
Mrs. Thomas...


328
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.520
...they were good to you, right?

329
00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.881
I'm sure they meant to be.
I'm sure they meant to be...


330
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.280
...just as kind and good
as they possibly...


331
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.040
Look at those sea gulls!

332
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.000
Wouldn't you just love to be
up there?


333
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.200
Swooping over land
and ocean all day long?


334
00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.840
Do you see?

335
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.159
My brother and I wanted a boy...

336
00:24:03.399 --> 00:24:05.080
...to help with the chores
around the farm.


337
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:07.280
So you can appreciate
that when a girl showed up...


338
00:24:07.439 --> 00:24:08.975
Anyway, we thought that
Social Services...


339
00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:11.095
...might be able to find a home
for her. A good family.


340
00:24:11.119 --> 00:24:12.280
One that will be kind to her.

341
00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:14.640
Miss Cuthbert, these days there
simply aren't enough...


342
00:24:14.679 --> 00:24:16.279
...good families to go around.

343
00:24:16.479 --> 00:24:18.695
If you hand her over to us,
we'll either have to send her...


344
00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:21.439
...back to the orphanage or to
the workhouse in Charlottetown.


345
00:24:21.679 --> 00:24:24.399
But tell me you at least be able
to find a proper family for her.


346
00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:28.399
Perhaps if you contact
Gladys Haines.


347
00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:31.279
She's head of Presbyterian
Orphan Homes in Charlottetown.


348
00:24:31.759 --> 00:24:34.199
I'm sorry, I have a desk
piled with cases.


349
00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:36.919
Good day, Miss Cuthbert.
- I...


350
00:24:39.159 --> 00:24:40.519
A lively young girl like you...

351
00:24:40.719 --> 00:24:43.519
...should be living with a proper
family, and going to school.


352
00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:46.479
So I have asked
Children's Services...


353
00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:48.240
...to look out for a good home
for you.


354
00:24:48.479 --> 00:24:51.998
One that has children your own age.
But in the meantime...


355
00:24:52.798 --> 00:24:54.318
I can stay?

356
00:24:54.918 --> 00:24:56.678
Well, yes, but it's only temporary.

357
00:24:57.158 --> 00:25:00.118
Miss Cuthbert, I promise to be
the best orphan...


358
00:25:00.358 --> 00:25:01.718
...you could ever hope for.

359
00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:04.718
Boy or girl.
I'll help with the chores...


360
00:25:05.158 --> 00:25:06.999
...and I'll try my best not to talk
too much...


361
00:25:07.158 --> 00:25:09.054
...and I'll try my absolute
hardest not to allow...


362
00:25:09.078 --> 00:25:12.678
...my imagination run away.
What should I call you? I know.


363
00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:14.638
What about Aunt Marilla?

364
00:25:14.878 --> 00:25:16.679
It would make me feel
as if I really belonged.


365
00:25:16.918 --> 00:25:18.438
No, I'm not your aunt.

366
00:25:18.678 --> 00:25:19.678
And I don't believe in...

367
00:25:19.878 --> 00:25:21.654
...calling people names
that don't belong to them.


368
00:25:21.678 --> 00:25:23.758
But you could imagine
you're my aunt.


369
00:25:24.438 --> 00:25:25.518
No, I couldn't.

370
00:25:26.438 --> 00:25:28.879
Don't you ever imagine things
different from the way they are?


371
00:25:29.438 --> 00:25:32.318
No, never.
And Marilla will do just fine.


372
00:25:34.158 --> 00:25:35.358
Marilla.

373
00:25:36.757 --> 00:25:37.917
What does it mean?

374
00:25:38.957 --> 00:25:40.997
I believe it's short for Amaryllis.

375
00:25:41.437 --> 00:25:43.277
That is such a beautiful name.

376
00:25:43.797 --> 00:25:46.637
Your mother and father must have
loved you very much.


377
00:25:55.277 --> 00:25:56.477
Good day, Muriel.

378
00:25:59.717 --> 00:26:00.917
How can I help you, Marilla?

379
00:26:01.157 --> 00:26:02.317
Just postage stamp.

380
00:26:03.677 --> 00:26:05.357
Presbyterian Orphan Homes.

381
00:26:05.597 --> 00:26:06.998
Must be about
your Anne girl, is it?


382
00:26:07.237 --> 00:26:09.277
Be sure you seal it up
after you've read it.


383
00:26:17.757 --> 00:26:18.797
Dear Mrs. Haines...

384
00:26:19.037 --> 00:26:20.838
...I'm writing to day,
Anne Shirley who was...


385
00:26:20.877 --> 00:26:22.717
...mistakenly delivered to
our home in Avonlea.


386
00:26:22.796 --> 00:26:24.397
Find it quite impossible
to care for her.


387
00:26:24.476 --> 00:26:26.677
Mrs. Beatty suggested,
you may find a suitable family...


388
00:26:26.916 --> 00:26:28.316
...for this child.

389
00:26:35.036 --> 00:26:37.076
Here now, let me take that.

390
00:26:40.876 --> 00:26:42.196
All right.

391
00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:43.556
Well done!

392
00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:44.956
Matthew...

393
00:26:46.156 --> 00:26:48.236
...may I please go
see the babbling brook.


394
00:26:48.436 --> 00:26:51.356
Just a peek. I would so,
so dearly love to see...


395
00:26:51.596 --> 00:26:52.836
...a real babbling brook.

396
00:26:54.916 --> 00:26:56.476
You promise to be careful?

397
00:26:56.716 --> 00:26:59.276
Don't worry. I'm an extremely
responsible child.


398
00:27:00.436 --> 00:27:02.836
Take the path behind the barn,
down the hill.


399
00:27:05.756 --> 00:27:07.636
You come back
if it starts raining!


400
00:27:50.995 --> 00:27:52.771
Why on earth didn't you leave her
with Mrs. Beatty?


401
00:27:52.795 --> 00:27:54.436
I couldn't send her back to the
orphanage.


402
00:27:54.475 --> 00:27:56.195
It's a girl had enough
hardship in her life.


403
00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:57.690
Then you should have taken her to
Mrs. Spencer.


404
00:27:57.714 --> 00:27:59.154
After all it was her mistake.

405
00:27:59.794 --> 00:28:01.514
It's only for a short time.

406
00:28:01.754 --> 00:28:04.794
It's only until Matthew takes her
into the town. We'll figure out.


407
00:28:05.034 --> 00:28:07.675
Marilla, I picked these down by the
brook. May I put them in water?


408
00:28:08.434 --> 00:28:10.914
Anne, this my neighbor
and my good friend, Mrs. Lynde.


409
00:28:11.714 --> 00:28:12.754
How do you do?

410
00:28:12.994 --> 00:28:15.474
Well, she's not much to look at.
Scrawny.


411
00:28:15.954 --> 00:28:17.314
Raspberry jam hair.

412
00:28:17.554 --> 00:28:19.514
My word, would you
look at those freckles.


413
00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:24.994
My dear, what an odd look.
What could it mean?


414
00:28:26.234 --> 00:28:27.554
It means I hate you.

415
00:28:27.794 --> 00:28:29.154
I beg your pardon?

416
00:28:29.434 --> 00:28:30.434
Anne!

417
00:28:31.314 --> 00:28:34.234
Anne! Anne, come back in here!

418
00:28:34.474 --> 00:28:35.714
Yes?

419
00:28:36.954 --> 00:28:38.074
What did you say?

420
00:28:38.954 --> 00:28:40.354
I said, I hate you.

421
00:28:40.834 --> 00:28:42.394
Anne Shirley.

422
00:28:43.393 --> 00:28:45.113
How dare you say I'm skinny
and ugly?


423
00:28:45.353 --> 00:28:47.433
How dare you call me I'm freckled
and red-headed.


424
00:28:47.633 --> 00:28:50.953
You are a rude, impolite,
unfeeling woman!


425
00:28:51.193 --> 00:28:53.193
All right, that is quite
enough of that.


426
00:28:53.433 --> 00:28:55.449
How would you like to have
such things said about you?


427
00:28:55.473 --> 00:28:57.674
How would you like to be told
you were fat and clumsy...


428
00:28:57.873 --> 00:28:59.993
...and probably hadn't a
spark of imagination?


429
00:29:00.433 --> 00:29:03.673
You have hurt me worse than
Mrs. Thomas's intoxicated husband!


430
00:29:03.913 --> 00:29:05.913
I shall never forgive you!
Never!


431
00:29:06.153 --> 00:29:08.554
All right, you stop that right now.
You go up to your room...


432
00:29:08.793 --> 00:29:10.873
...and you stay there
until I come and get you.


433
00:29:11.353 --> 00:29:12.433
Go on!

434
00:29:14.313 --> 00:29:15.913
Have you ever seen such a temper?

435
00:29:16.153 --> 00:29:18.354
But you probably shouldn't have
twitted about her looks.


436
00:29:18.553 --> 00:29:19.633
She...

437
00:29:19.833 --> 00:29:20.953
What?

438
00:29:22.433 --> 00:29:23.673
Anne.

439
00:29:26.033 --> 00:29:27.113
Anne.

440
00:29:27.593 --> 00:29:28.673
Sit up.

441
00:29:30.592 --> 00:29:34.232
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Behaving that way to your elders.


442
00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:37.792
Imagine how you would feel
if somebody told you...


443
00:29:38.032 --> 00:29:40.272
...straight to your face
you were nothing to look at!


444
00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:43.273
I didn't say that Rachel Lynde
was right. She can be very...


445
00:29:43.592 --> 00:29:46.392
Anyway, there is no excuse.
You were very rude to her.


446
00:29:46.632 --> 00:29:47.928
You need to tell her
that you're sorry...


447
00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:49.432
...and ask her for forgiveness.

448
00:29:49.672 --> 00:29:51.232
- I won't!
- Anne!


449
00:29:51.472 --> 00:29:54.872
You can punish me any way you like.
Shut me up in a dark...


450
00:29:55.112 --> 00:29:57.712
...damp dungeon inhabited
by snakes and toads!


451
00:29:58.152 --> 00:30:00.072
Or send me back to
that horrible orphanage.


452
00:30:00.312 --> 00:30:02.072
I'm not going to
send you anywhere.


453
00:30:05.752 --> 00:30:07.232
Well, whatever you do...

454
00:30:08.312 --> 00:30:11.272
...I am never going to apologize
to Mrs. Lynde.


455
00:30:11.552 --> 00:30:13.072
Never!

456
00:30:14.072 --> 00:30:15.953
Very well. Then I think
what you should do is...


457
00:30:16.032 --> 00:30:18.551
...just stay right here
until you reconsider.


458
00:30:34.471 --> 00:30:36.231
Anne? I have your breakfast.

459
00:30:38.511 --> 00:30:40.311
It's out here when you want it.

460
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.470
Miss Anne? May I come in?

461
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:43.870
All right.

462
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.670
How you feeling?

463
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.429
Quite well, thank you.

464
00:31:53.709 --> 00:31:55.029
Not hungry?

465
00:31:55.709 --> 00:31:57.149
Maybe later.

466
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:58.629
Later then.

467
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:05.069
Listen, Miss Anne with an "e".

468
00:32:05.829 --> 00:32:07.350
My sister is a very
determined woman...


469
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:08.950
...and nobody gets the best of her.

470
00:32:09.069 --> 00:32:10.309
So, if I were you...

471
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:13.669
...I'd smooth over what's between
you. And the sooner the better.


472
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:18.509
- Apologize?
- Yes. What say you?


473
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:22.789
I suppose I could do it
to oblige you.


474
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:28.349
It would be sort of true.

475
00:32:28.709 --> 00:32:30.629
Since I really am sorry.

476
00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:34.229
I wasn't a bit last night.
But this morning...


477
00:32:34.469 --> 00:32:37.108
...I felt so ashamed of
my behavior.


478
00:32:37.308 --> 00:32:39.308
Do you really truly think
I should?


479
00:32:39.508 --> 00:32:43.308
I know is without you it's
terrible lonesome around here.


480
00:32:44.348 --> 00:32:48.908
Now listen. Don't let onto Marilla
that I say anything about this.


481
00:32:49.148 --> 00:32:52.508
I promised to keep my oar
out of the water.


482
00:32:52.748 --> 00:32:54.148
So to speak.

483
00:33:28.547 --> 00:33:30.347
I think I apologized pretty well.

484
00:33:30.587 --> 00:33:33.043
I thought since I had to do it,
I might as well do it thoroughly.


485
00:33:33.067 --> 00:33:35.667
You certainly did it thoroughly.
Next time you might wanna...


486
00:33:35.907 --> 00:33:37.707
...try to control your temper
a little.


487
00:33:38.147 --> 00:33:40.627
That would be easier if people
didn't twit about my hair.


488
00:33:40.867 --> 00:33:43.307
That sort of thing makes me
boil right over.


489
00:33:43.547 --> 00:33:45.587
You shouldn't think so much about
your looks.


490
00:33:45.827 --> 00:33:47.787
I think you might be quite
a vain little girl.


491
00:33:48.027 --> 00:33:49.827
How can I be vain when
I'm feeling homely?


492
00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:52.547
When I look in the glass what I see
doesn't make me feel vain.


493
00:33:52.787 --> 00:33:54.348
It makes me feel sorrowful
and pathetic.


494
00:33:54.507 --> 00:33:55.827
Handsome is as handsome does.

495
00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:58.467
Handsome does is much easier
if you're handsome is.


496
00:33:59.947 --> 00:34:01.427
You might have a point.

497
00:34:11.626 --> 00:34:13.746
Set it down, Anne. 
I'll hold it in.

498
00:34:14.266 --> 00:34:15.866
It's all right Matthew.

499
00:34:17.666 --> 00:34:19.866
You see, I'm ever so much stronger.

500
00:34:46.506 --> 00:34:48.746
Don't you ever say your prayers
before bed?


501
00:34:49.466 --> 00:34:50.786
I don't know any.

502
00:34:51.826 --> 00:34:53.106
You don't know any?

503
00:34:53.346 --> 00:34:57.825
Prayers. Never learned any.
But I'm good at making stuff up.


504
00:34:58.265 --> 00:34:59.665
How do I start?

505
00:35:01.745 --> 00:35:04.105
Well, you...
First you kneel down.


506
00:35:07.945 --> 00:35:10.105
Not on the bed.
On the floor.


507
00:35:10.465 --> 00:35:11.505
Why?

508
00:35:11.905 --> 00:35:13.585
That's just the way it's done.

509
00:35:19.905 --> 00:35:23.865
Now, you thank God for your
many blessings...


510
00:35:24.105 --> 00:35:28.905
...and then you ask him humbly
for the things that you want.


511
00:35:31.545 --> 00:35:33.465
Gracious Heavenly Father.

512
00:35:33.705 --> 00:35:35.146
That's a good start,
don't you think?


513
00:35:35.225 --> 00:35:36.345
Very good start.

514
00:35:36.585 --> 00:35:37.945
Gracious Heavenly Father...

515
00:35:38.185 --> 00:35:41.145
I thank thee for
the White Way of Delight...


516
00:35:41.385 --> 00:35:43.065
...the Lake of Shining Waters...

517
00:35:43.305 --> 00:35:46.024
...the smell of the lilacs,
the sound of the spring peepers.


518
00:35:47.424 --> 00:35:49.024
I could go on and on.

519
00:35:49.624 --> 00:35:51.064
But what do I want?

520
00:35:51.264 --> 00:35:53.864
Well, mainly two things.

521
00:35:56.344 --> 00:36:00.104
Please let me stay
at Green Gables forever.


522
00:36:00.344 --> 00:36:02.064
And please...

523
00:36:02.304 --> 00:36:03.944
...let me be good-looking
when I grow up.


524
00:36:05.544 --> 00:36:09.064
Your humble servant,
etcetera etcetera, Anne Shirley.


525
00:36:10.144 --> 00:36:12.104
I think that was good,
don't you Marilla?


526
00:36:12.624 --> 00:36:15.544
I could have made it more
flowery if I'd had more time.


527
00:36:15.784 --> 00:36:18.824
And I probably should have said
Amen at the end. What do you think?


528
00:36:19.384 --> 00:36:21.024
Do you think it will make
a difference?


529
00:36:21.264 --> 00:36:23.064
I think we should get you
to church.


530
00:36:30.664 --> 00:36:32.503
Etcetera etcetera.

531
00:36:39.343 --> 00:36:41.063
Marilla found these for you.

532
00:36:41.303 --> 00:36:42.463
They're lovely.

533
00:36:42.703 --> 00:36:44.263
Not new but almost.

534
00:36:44.823 --> 00:36:46.864
She thought one of them
might suit for church today.


535
00:36:47.103 --> 00:36:48.704
...and you can wear the others
to school.


536
00:36:48.783 --> 00:36:50.263
I'm going to school?

537
00:36:51.503 --> 00:36:54.143
Marilla's having one of her
aches in the old noggin.


538
00:36:54.383 --> 00:36:56.223
Dear. Is there anything I can do?

539
00:36:56.743 --> 00:36:59.783
It would make her happy
if you liked these dresses. Do you?


540
00:37:00.023 --> 00:37:01.423
I do...

541
00:37:01.663 --> 00:37:04.223
...and I am ever so grateful but...

542
00:37:04.463 --> 00:37:08.103
...I'd be so much more
gratefuller if...


543
00:37:08.423 --> 00:37:11.463
...if just one of
them had puffed sleeves.


544
00:37:13.183 --> 00:37:16.023
I have never heard of
puffed sleeves on a child's dress.


545
00:37:16.263 --> 00:37:18.102
Puffed sleeves are
all the fashion now.


546
00:37:18.782 --> 00:37:20.342
And it would be ever
so thrilling...


547
00:37:20.542 --> 00:37:22.183
...if I could wear
a puffed sleeves dress.


548
00:37:22.462 --> 00:37:24.822
Even just one time in my life.

549
00:37:26.542 --> 00:37:30.262
I suppose you can take that up
with Marilla. And do so quietly.


550
00:37:30.502 --> 00:37:33.502
And in the meantime, could you
chose one of these for church?


551
00:37:42.382 --> 00:37:43.462
Marilla?

552
00:37:50.502 --> 00:37:53.622
I chose this outfit
for church today.


553
00:37:57.182 --> 00:37:59.262
That's good. It's plain and simple.

554
00:37:59.862 --> 00:38:01.462
But...

555
00:38:02.142 --> 00:38:04.222
...I was wondering if...

556
00:38:04.462 --> 00:38:07.461
...if I can also have a dress
with puffed sleeves.


557
00:38:07.941 --> 00:38:09.701
It would give me such a thrill.

558
00:38:09.941 --> 00:38:12.181
You'll have to let go of
your thrills.


559
00:38:12.421 --> 00:38:15.141
Puffed sleeves are a fad
and they look ridiculous.


560
00:38:15.381 --> 00:38:17.262
I'd rather look ridiculous like
everyone else...


561
00:38:17.501 --> 00:38:19.421
...than look plain and simple
all by myself.


562
00:38:19.661 --> 00:38:21.861
Nonsense. Plain and simple is good.

563
00:38:30.101 --> 00:38:32.061
Could you put that on my dresser?

564
00:38:38.021 --> 00:38:39.981
Like a Royal Jewel.

565
00:38:40.621 --> 00:38:42.541
What is that glorious stone?

566
00:38:42.781 --> 00:38:44.261
It's an amethyst.

567
00:38:45.501 --> 00:38:48.421
You can open up, if you like.
There's a picture inside.


568
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.900
Is that your mother?

569
00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.780
She looks like you.

570
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.940
I guess, you look like her
is more correct.


571
00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.460
Put that on my dresser.
Go on.


572
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:12.020
You're going to have to walk
by yourself to the church today.


573
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.100
It's not very far.
You're gonna be all right?


574
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.820
Yes, I love to walk.

575
00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.500
Especially on a tree-lined
country road.


576
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.476
Although this will be my first
time I've actually ever walked...


577
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.380
...on a tree-lined country road.

578
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.700
Off you go.

579
00:39:58.339 --> 00:39:59.819
Who is that?

580
00:40:01.739 --> 00:40:04.139
That's the orphan with the red hair
I was telling you about.


581
00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.419
What have she done to her hat?

582
00:40:22.259 --> 00:40:25.578
Rachel said she nearly sank
through the floor when she saw you.


583
00:40:26.298 --> 00:40:28.378
People are gonna think
that it's all my fault.


584
00:40:28.858 --> 00:40:31.314
I'm sorry, Marilla. I didn't know
it was wrong to wear flowers.


585
00:40:31.338 --> 00:40:33.418
It's not wrong, it's just...

586
00:40:34.458 --> 00:40:37.498
Tell me child, do all of your
little friends behave like you do?


587
00:40:37.738 --> 00:40:41.138
I've never had a friend,
at least not my own age.


588
00:40:42.018 --> 00:40:45.578
You never had a friend? We'll
have to do something about that.


589
00:40:52.418 --> 00:40:54.418
No reason to feel cobblesome.

590
00:40:55.898 --> 00:40:57.418
Just don't use any of
your long words.


591
00:40:57.658 --> 00:40:59.538
They'll think you're odd.

592
00:41:01.218 --> 00:41:03.018
What if Diana doesn't like me?

593
00:41:03.538 --> 00:41:07.018
My dear girl, it's Mrs. Barry
you have to worry about.


594
00:41:07.258 --> 00:41:10.058
If she doesn't like you, it doesn't
matter what Diana thinks.


595
00:41:11.498 --> 00:41:13.337
All right now,
you mind your Ps and Qs.


596
00:41:20.537 --> 00:41:23.057
- Well now, good morning, Marilla?
- Hello.


597
00:41:23.297 --> 00:41:25.937
- And you must be Anne.
- How do you do, Misses Bary?


598
00:41:26.177 --> 00:41:27.177
Please.

599
00:41:42.337 --> 00:41:43.497
Hello Diana.

600
00:41:43.737 --> 00:41:45.297
Good afternoon, 
Miss Cuthbert.

601
00:41:45.537 --> 00:41:47.377
Diana, this is Anne.

602
00:41:47.617 --> 00:41:49.897
Anne, this is my little girl,
Diana.


603
00:41:50.137 --> 00:41:51.217
How do you do?

604
00:41:52.577 --> 00:41:55.617
Darling, why don't take Anne for
a nice walk around the property?


605
00:41:55.857 --> 00:41:57.417
Yes, mother. Come.

606
00:42:01.856 --> 00:42:05.016
My goodness, is she not the most
scrumptious little apricot?


607
00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:06.336
Yeah.

608
00:42:06.976 --> 00:42:07.976
Yeah.

609
00:42:09.016 --> 00:42:10.696
My mother says
you're a strange bird.


610
00:42:10.936 --> 00:42:12.336
I'd like to be a bird.

611
00:42:13.176 --> 00:42:14.816
Sometimes you talk to trees?

612
00:42:15.056 --> 00:42:18.816
I do as well. Of course, I know
it's only the wind in the leaves...


613
00:42:19.056 --> 00:42:22.416
...but I like to think, well,
it's something else.


614
00:42:22.896 --> 00:42:24.896
Let's pretend. 
I mean, together.

615
00:42:25.136 --> 00:42:27.176
- Pretend what?
- Anything you like.


616
00:42:27.976 --> 00:42:29.352
Do you want to see
my secret island?


617
00:42:29.376 --> 00:42:30.536
Why's it a secret?

618
00:42:30.776 --> 00:42:32.776
- Fairies live there.
- Really?


619
00:42:33.576 --> 00:42:35.737
But you have to be very quiet
or you'll scare them off.


620
00:42:35.776 --> 00:42:36.816
I know that.

621
00:42:37.176 --> 00:42:39.656
- Shall we go?
- Yes!


622
00:42:40.576 --> 00:42:41.896
Have you ever seen a fairy?

623
00:42:43.056 --> 00:42:45.815
I did once, but I don't think
it had wings.


624
00:42:46.055 --> 00:42:49.735
Only special ones have wings.
These ones have very soft voices.


625
00:43:03.415 --> 00:43:06.135
Most beautiful place
I've ever seen.


626
00:43:06.935 --> 00:43:08.095
Listen.

627
00:43:12.335 --> 00:43:16.015
Diana? Would you like to be
my bosom friend?


628
00:43:17.015 --> 00:43:18.535
I don't see why not.

629
00:43:18.775 --> 00:43:20.855
- Will you swear to it?
- It's wicked to swear.


630
00:43:21.095 --> 00:43:23.295
Not that kind of swearing,
the other kind.


631
00:43:24.095 --> 00:43:25.255
What other kind?

632
00:43:25.495 --> 00:43:26.615
Close your eyes.

633
00:43:30.455 --> 00:43:32.414
I, Anne Shirley...

634
00:43:32.614 --> 00:43:36.694
...do solemnly swear to be faithful
to my bosom friend, Diana Barry...


635
00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:40.254
...as long as the sun
and moon shall endure.


636
00:43:42.014 --> 00:43:43.934
Now you say it
and put my name in.


637
00:43:46.374 --> 00:43:48.574
I, Diana Barry...

638
00:43:48.814 --> 00:43:51.454
...do solemnly swear...

639
00:43:51.774 --> 00:43:53.215
- To be faithful.
- To be faithful...


640
00:43:53.254 --> 00:43:55.374
...to my bosom friend,
Anne Shirley...


641
00:43:56.454 --> 00:44:00.054
...for as long as the sun
and moon shall endure.


642
00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:12.374
Shoo!

643
00:44:35.893 --> 00:44:37.053
Hello.

644
00:44:38.653 --> 00:44:39.973
What's your name?

645
00:44:43.573 --> 00:44:46.573
I'll call you Guinevre.

646
00:45:16.612 --> 00:45:18.892
A picnic, huh?
That's something.


647
00:45:19.132 --> 00:45:20.692
Yes. There's going to be...

648
00:45:20.892 --> 00:45:22.732
...a rowing boat race
on McMurrich river.


649
00:45:22.972 --> 00:45:24.428
...and three-legged race
on The Common.


650
00:45:24.452 --> 00:45:25.868
And Mrs. Lynde is going to
make ice cream.


651
00:45:25.892 --> 00:45:27.732
I've never tasted ice cream.

652
00:45:27.932 --> 00:45:29.732
Diana tried to explain
that to me but...


653
00:45:29.972 --> 00:45:31.252
Anne Shirley!

654
00:45:44.332 --> 00:45:46.212
Have you seen my amethyst brooch?

655
00:45:47.612 --> 00:45:49.572
Last time I saw it was...

656
00:45:53.291 --> 00:45:55.771
I know, it was yesterday.

657
00:45:56.331 --> 00:45:58.171
While you were away
at the your meeting.


658
00:45:58.371 --> 00:46:00.931
I was passing your door
when I saw it...


659
00:46:01.171 --> 00:46:02.451
...so I went in to look.

660
00:46:03.491 --> 00:46:04.691
And then?

661
00:46:05.411 --> 00:46:09.691
And then I took it up and I pinned
it on to see how it looked.


662
00:46:09.931 --> 00:46:11.851
Then I put it right back.
- Put it back where?


663
00:46:12.091 --> 00:46:13.331
On the bureau.

664
00:46:20.291 --> 00:46:22.571
No, really, I put it straight back.

665
00:46:22.811 --> 00:46:24.891
I believe you are telling me
a falsehood.


666
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:27.091
I swear, I didn't...

667
00:46:27.291 --> 00:46:28.867
You go into your room
and don't you come out...


668
00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:30.331
...until you are ready to confess.

669
00:46:30.531 --> 00:46:31.691
Go on.

670
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:45.810
Marilla?

671
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:48.970
I took the brooch.

672
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:51.410
I didn't mean to,
but I was overcome...


673
00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.450
...by an irresistible temptation.

674
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:55.306
I took it with me
when I went to Diana's...


675
00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:56.730
...so I could play Lady Cordelia.

676
00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.170
I thought I could put it back
before you came home.


677
00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:00.786
But when I was crossing
the bridge...


678
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:02.866
...it slipped through my fingers
and dropped down into...


679
00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:05.410
...the purple sparkling waves
and sank for evermore...


680
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:06.971
...in the Lake of Shining Waters.

681
00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.970
Anne Shirley, you are the most
aggravating child...


682
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.490
...I have ever met.

683
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.090
I suppose I am.

684
00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.210
And I know I'll have to be
punished.


685
00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:18.650
But can you please get it over with
right away?


686
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:20.186
Because I'd like to go
to the picnic...


687
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.450
...with nothing on my conscience.
- Picnic?


688
00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:25.250
It's tomorrow.

689
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:27.329
There'll be no picnic for you.

690
00:47:28.689 --> 00:47:30.809
But that's why I confessed.

691
00:47:33.849 --> 00:47:36.889
Marilla, please let me go.
Think of the ice cream.


692
00:47:37.129 --> 00:47:39.249
I may never have a chance
to taste it ever again.


693
00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:42.529
Ice crime? Do you have any idea
what that brooch meant to me?


694
00:47:43.169 --> 00:47:45.489
Why do you always causing
so much trouble?


695
00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:48.409
Red hair makes it easier
to be bad than good.


696
00:47:49.009 --> 00:47:50.745
People who don't have it
cannot understand...


697
00:47:50.769 --> 00:47:52.329
...what terrible trouble it is.

698
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:55.369
There'll be no picnic for you.
And that's final.


699
00:48:09.689 --> 00:48:11.329
Josie, have you seen Anne?

700
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:13.208
I don't understand what you
see in her.


701
00:48:13.408 --> 00:48:15.048
I mean she's just a charity case.

702
00:48:15.488 --> 00:48:16.968
My mother said that as soon as...

703
00:48:17.168 --> 00:48:19.529
...the Cuthberts find a home
for her, she'll be moving away.


704
00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:23.368
Josie Pye, you are the meanest girl
on all of Prince Edward Island.


705
00:48:57.248 --> 00:48:59.168
Dear life and heart.

706
00:49:04.367 --> 00:49:05.447
Anne?

707
00:49:17.647 --> 00:49:21.407
I apologize. I never should have
doubted your word.


708
00:49:23.047 --> 00:49:27.007
And maybe you better go on comb
your hair and put on your gingham.


709
00:49:28.567 --> 00:49:30.327
Go on, be quick about it.

710
00:49:51.446 --> 00:49:53.166
Anne!

711
00:49:53.926 --> 00:49:55.206
You came!

712
00:49:56.646 --> 00:49:57.686
Come on.

713
00:50:05.366 --> 00:50:08.206
That's Gilbert Blythe.
He teases all the girls.


714
00:50:10.446 --> 00:50:11.766
So I can see.

715
00:50:12.006 --> 00:50:14.286
But he's fair handsome,
don't you think?


716
00:50:19.006 --> 00:50:20.726
Here you go.

717
00:50:21.286 --> 00:50:22.526
Thank you, Mrs. Lynde.

718
00:50:22.766 --> 00:50:25.486
It's my first time ever
in my life tasting ice cream.


719
00:50:32.086 --> 00:50:33.166
Well?

720
00:50:41.725 --> 00:50:43.365
Is it not scrumptious?

721
00:50:44.525 --> 00:50:46.125
I would say...

722
00:50:50.365 --> 00:50:51.965
...sublime.

723
00:50:58.565 --> 00:51:00.525
Here, now. Stand still.

724
00:51:00.765 --> 00:51:03.085
It has always been my deepest
desire to have an education.


725
00:51:03.325 --> 00:51:06.125
Well, I'm sure you'll be fine
as long as you don't talk too much.


726
00:51:06.405 --> 00:51:07.885
Bye, Matthew.

727
00:51:10.645 --> 00:51:13.125
- Hardly seems possible
- What?


728
00:51:13.845 --> 00:51:15.326
She's only been with us
four months...


729
00:51:15.445 --> 00:51:17.485
...and it's like she's always
been here.


730
00:51:19.485 --> 00:51:21.764
Stop your sentimental drivel.
It's unbecoming.


731
00:51:22.284 --> 00:51:25.004
And don't you get to attached
Matthew Cuthbert.


732
00:52:06.963 --> 00:52:07.963
Good morning, sir.

733
00:52:08.203 --> 00:52:09.443
Good morning, Mr. Phillips.

734
00:52:11.803 --> 00:52:13.443
- Diana, where do we sit?
- Don't worry.


735
00:52:13.683 --> 00:52:15.563
- I'm so nervous.
- Come on.


736
00:52:19.483 --> 00:52:21.403
Sit here. Sit here beside me.

737
00:52:24.443 --> 00:52:27.243
Scholars! Up!

738
00:52:28.323 --> 00:52:29.523
It fell out.

739
00:52:30.483 --> 00:52:31.683
See what I mean?

740
00:52:31.923 --> 00:52:33.403
Far too bold and poorly mannered.

741
00:52:33.643 --> 00:52:37.443
Scholars! That's enough!
Show respect for The King!


742
00:52:42.963 --> 00:52:47.923
God save our gracious King

743
00:52:48.163 --> 00:52:52.643
Long live our noble King

744
00:52:52.883 --> 00:52:57.002
God save the King

745
00:52:57.482 --> 00:53:02.162
Send him victorious

746
00:53:02.402 --> 00:53:06.722
Happy and glorious

747
00:53:06.962 --> 00:53:10.242
Long to reign over us

748
00:53:10.522 --> 00:53:11.522
Good.

749
00:53:12.162 --> 00:53:13.802
Hey, you.

750
00:53:14.522 --> 00:53:16.522
Anne, hey!

751
00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:24.642
- That's right.
- Ding dong.


752
00:53:26.442 --> 00:53:27.842
Hello there, Carrots.

753
00:53:28.722 --> 00:53:29.882
How dare you?

754
00:53:30.122 --> 00:53:31.842
Hey, don't go haywire.

755
00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:33.603
I was only trying to
get your attention.


756
00:53:33.842 --> 00:53:36.402
You are a mean and hateful boy
and I won't ever forgive you.


757
00:53:38.082 --> 00:53:39.562
What's this disturbance?

758
00:53:42.441 --> 00:53:45.441
It's my fault sir. I teased her.

759
00:53:45.681 --> 00:53:47.081
Thank you, Percy. Please sit.

760
00:53:49.161 --> 00:53:51.401
Anne Shirley, come and stand
at the blackboard...


761
00:53:51.641 --> 00:53:54.281
...and you will stay here
for the remainder of the day. Come.


762
00:53:58.281 --> 00:54:02.521
I will control...

763
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:06.321
...my temper.

764
00:54:09.041 --> 00:54:11.681
Read it, believe it
and then start behaving...


765
00:54:11.881 --> 00:54:13.521
...like a civilized human being.

766
00:54:13.761 --> 00:54:14.801
Do you understand?

767
00:54:15.041 --> 00:54:17.481
Yes. But can I just say something
on my behalf?


768
00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.201
No, you may not.

769
00:54:25.401 --> 00:54:27.001
I'm sorry I made fun of your hair.

770
00:54:27.281 --> 00:54:28.960
Honest I am.
- No, you're not!


771
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.520
Give me a chance.

772
00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.360
- I won't. Not ever!
- Why's that?


773
00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.720
Because I said I wouldn't
and I always keep my word.


774
00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:39.320
- But that's not a real reason.
- It is to me.


775
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.400
Anne!

776
00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.320
Why did you do that?
You could have injured him.


777
00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:48.200
That was the point.

778
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.200
Gilbert Blythe hurt my feelings
excruciatingly.


779
00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.040
I told you, remember?

780
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.201
Gilbert makes fun of all the girls,
not just you.


781
00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.160
The cold iron has entered my soul.

782
00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:05.320
I believe, for me, the pursuit of
education no longer has meaning.


783
00:55:17.959 --> 00:55:20.599
Hello young lady.
How was school today?


784
00:55:22.679 --> 00:55:24.519
I doubt I shall return.

785
00:55:24.759 --> 00:55:26.679
Really? But why is that?

786
00:55:27.159 --> 00:55:28.879
My honor has been tarnished.

787
00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:31.239
Honor's a prize for fools.

788
00:55:33.679 --> 00:55:35.079
Anne Shirley!

789
00:55:39.319 --> 00:55:41.559
I have a meeting on
Saturday afternoon in town.


790
00:55:41.799 --> 00:55:43.439
Why don't you ask
your friend, Diana...


791
00:55:43.679 --> 00:55:45.095
...when you go back to school
tomorrow...


792
00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:46.760
...if she wants to come over
and have tea.


793
00:55:48.879 --> 00:55:50.599
Really, Marilla? 
Do you mean it?

794
00:55:50.839 --> 00:55:52.775
Of course I mean it.
I never joke about anything...


795
00:55:52.799 --> 00:55:54.239
...as important as friendship.

796
00:56:05.758 --> 00:56:08.998
Miss Barry, do you come in.
My, what a lovely frock.


797
00:56:09.238 --> 00:56:11.238
This? My morning dress.

798
00:56:11.478 --> 00:56:13.398
In the afternoons I usually wear
blue satin.


799
00:56:13.638 --> 00:56:15.918
The tea should be steeped by now.
Do you come in.


800
00:56:17.958 --> 00:56:20.078
And pray, how is your dear mother?

801
00:56:20.318 --> 00:56:23.878
Very well, thank you, though she
has a bad case of hives.


802
00:56:24.118 --> 00:56:25.278
What was that?

803
00:56:25.998 --> 00:56:27.078
Never mind.

804
00:56:27.838 --> 00:56:31.078
Would you care for some fruit cake?
Marilla is an excellent cook.


805
00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:32.798
Marilla?

806
00:56:33.318 --> 00:56:34.438
My maid.

807
00:56:34.718 --> 00:56:36.614
Holy cats. Marilla said
we could share some of her...


808
00:56:36.638 --> 00:56:38.998
...raspberry cordial.
Be back in a jiffy.


809
00:56:39.598 --> 00:56:41.238
That is to say,
if you'll be so kind...


810
00:56:41.438 --> 00:56:43.438
...as to excuse me for a moment?

811
00:56:43.678 --> 00:56:45.038
Of course.

812
00:57:09.637 --> 00:57:13.117
That's an awfully nice raspberry
cordial, Miss Shirley.


813
00:57:13.477 --> 00:57:15.157
Would you care for another drop?

814
00:57:18.277 --> 00:57:21.637
I didn't know raspberry cordials
could taste so awfully nice.


815
00:57:21.877 --> 00:57:22.917
But it is.

816
00:57:37.716 --> 00:57:41.396
I'd have some myself
if I wasn't so full of cake.


817
00:57:41.636 --> 00:57:43.036
Would you like another slice?

818
00:57:59.636 --> 00:58:01.476
Are you...

819
00:58:05.476 --> 00:58:07.596
Are you all right?

820
00:58:07.836 --> 00:58:10.436
I feel rather coggly.

821
00:58:10.836 --> 00:58:12.236
Sit down, I'll pour your tea.

822
00:58:12.476 --> 00:58:13.716
I have to go.

823
00:58:17.236 --> 00:58:18.276
Anne!

824
00:58:18.956 --> 00:58:20.436
- In here!
- Anne!


825
00:58:22.035 --> 00:58:24.195
Anne, I just had a talk
with Mrs. Barry.


826
00:58:24.435 --> 00:58:27.235
She tells me that you are never
allowed to play with Diana again.


827
00:58:27.595 --> 00:58:28.595
Why?

828
00:58:28.835 --> 00:58:31.955
Apparently, she came home drunk.
Can you explain that?


829
00:58:33.275 --> 00:58:35.235
- Drunk?
- What did you give her?


830
00:58:35.475 --> 00:58:36.515
Just...

831
00:58:36.755 --> 00:58:39.035
You said I could serve
raspberry cordial.


832
00:58:39.835 --> 00:58:40.995
Show me the bottle.

833
00:58:51.115 --> 00:58:54.475
Anne Shirley, you have
a genius for getting into trouble.


834
00:58:54.955 --> 00:58:57.436
This is my red currant wine.
Could you not tell the difference?


835
00:58:57.635 --> 00:58:59.195
I didn't taste it myself.

836
00:59:00.075 --> 00:59:02.556
Marilla, what am I gonna do?
Diana is my bosom friend for life.


837
00:59:02.675 --> 00:59:03.875
We swore an oath.

838
00:59:04.115 --> 00:59:05.691
It's all right. There's no need
for tears.


839
00:59:05.715 --> 00:59:06.891
I believe that you're
telling me the truth.


840
00:59:06.915 --> 00:59:10.234
I'll go and speak to Mrs. Barry.
Don't worry about it.


841
00:59:26.394 --> 00:59:27.474
Marilla!

842
00:59:28.074 --> 00:59:29.074
Marilla!

843
00:59:29.314 --> 00:59:30.634
Did you speak to Mrs. Barry?

844
00:59:30.954 --> 00:59:32.874
Is everything all right?
Did she understand?


845
00:59:33.114 --> 00:59:35.514
I tried to wait for you when
you got home but I fell asleep.


846
00:59:35.754 --> 00:59:38.754
Diana's mother
had quite a lot to say about it.


847
00:59:39.674 --> 00:59:41.074
She doesn't think...

848
00:59:41.394 --> 00:59:44.314
Well, she feels that you're not
the fit companion for her daughter.


849
00:59:44.554 --> 00:59:46.434
Why am I not a fit companion?

850
00:59:47.594 --> 00:59:50.234
Believe me, Diana was just
as upset about it as you are.


851
00:59:50.474 --> 00:59:52.234
It's not fair!

852
01:00:20.553 --> 01:00:21.793
Matthew!

853
01:00:22.913 --> 01:00:24.153
Matthew!

854
01:00:24.473 --> 01:00:26.033
Here. Come on.
Get up.


855
01:00:26.273 --> 01:00:27.753
- No.
- No, you are all right.


856
01:00:27.993 --> 01:00:28.993
- I'm all right.
- Come.


857
01:00:29.233 --> 01:00:31.473
Just a little dizzy spell.

858
01:00:32.393 --> 01:00:34.513
Stop. Give me that. Come on.

859
01:00:34.793 --> 01:00:36.353
Come.

860
01:00:39.753 --> 01:00:41.633
Give us a nice breath.

861
01:00:43.992 --> 01:00:45.032
One more.

862
01:00:52.032 --> 01:00:56.352
Well, there is a little bit of
heart flutter there.


863
01:00:56.592 --> 01:01:00.392
It's a warning. You're not
as young as you used to be.


864
01:01:00.632 --> 01:01:02.153
Is there anything
you could do for him?


865
01:01:02.272 --> 01:01:07.152
Try not to exert yourself
and avoid too much excitement.


866
01:01:07.392 --> 01:01:09.312
It would be harder to find some.

867
01:01:10.032 --> 01:01:13.712
Some truth in that.
Well, I gotta be going.


868
01:01:13.952 --> 01:01:15.992
- Thanks George. So long.
- Your welcome.


869
01:01:18.072 --> 01:01:19.872
Is he all right to be left alone?

870
01:01:20.112 --> 01:01:23.872
I am not alone. Anne is here.
We're kindred spirits.


871
01:01:38.431 --> 01:01:39.631
Your move.

872
01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:53.271
Ruby Gillis says that
when a man is courting...


873
01:01:53.511 --> 01:01:55.151
...he always has to agree with...

874
01:01:55.431 --> 01:02:00.991
...the girl's mother on religion
and her father on politics.


875
01:02:02.071 --> 01:02:03.311
Is that always true?

876
01:02:03.551 --> 01:02:05.551
Well, I'm not so sure.

877
01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:06.831
Your move.

878
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:08.671
Have you ever been courting?

879
01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:13.871
Of course I did. But you know,
being a poor farmer...


880
01:02:14.111 --> 01:02:16.750
...on the remote island,
possibilities were limited.


881
01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:19.070
What about Marilla?

882
01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:20.990
Did she ever have a beau?

883
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:24.470
Yeah, she did. Long ago
and it didn't work out I'm afraid.


884
01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:26.990
But you mustn't bring it up to her.

885
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:28.310
What happened?

886
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.590
Well, as I recall, he was a
good decent fellow but...


887
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:36.070
...our mother didn't see it
that way exactly.


888
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:38.710
And that was that?

889
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:41.430
That was that.

890
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:44.150
Anne!

891
01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.271
Minnie May has croup.
She's awful sick...


892
01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:52.726
...and mother and father aren't
home and I need to get a doctor.


893
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:55.110
I'm so scared!
- Don't be scared child.


894
01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:58.270
No. You stay there and stay warm.
I'll take care of it.


895
01:02:58.550 --> 01:02:59.870
I've been around many babies.

896
01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.070
Now, does Marilla have any Ipecac?

897
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:03.925
Yes, it is in the kitchen.
Over the stove.


898
01:03:03.949 --> 01:03:04.949
Come on.

899
01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:11.029
Anne, I'm so afraid
that she could die.


900
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:12.589
You go fetch Doctor Spencer.

901
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:24.629
Hello, Minnie May.
It's Anne. Do you remember me?


902
01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:26.229
I'm Diana's friend.

903
01:03:26.629 --> 01:03:28.349
I've come to help you feel better.

904
01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:35.229
I need hot water
and some soft cloths.


905
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:40.669
Okay, Minnie May, I want you to
sit up and drink a little of this.


906
01:03:40.909 --> 01:03:42.309
I don't want to.

907
01:03:43.429 --> 01:03:45.709
I promise you will
start to feel better.


908
01:03:45.949 --> 01:03:47.469
I don't want to.

909
01:03:48.749 --> 01:03:52.428
I'll tell you what,
you drink a spoonful...


910
01:03:54.388 --> 01:03:58.028
...and I'll tell you
a wonderful story.


911
01:04:04.628 --> 01:04:08.948
Once upon a time there were
two beautiful maidens...


912
01:04:09.188 --> 01:04:11.868
...called Geraldine and Cordelia.

913
01:04:12.668 --> 01:04:16.068
Cordelia was dark-haired
with an alabaster brow.


914
01:04:16.668 --> 01:04:19.628
Geraldine was blonde
with hair like spun gold...


915
01:04:19.988 --> 01:04:22.668
...and eyes a velvety purple.

916
01:04:23.748 --> 01:04:25.948
Purple? I like purple.

917
01:04:26.708 --> 01:04:27.708
Me too.

918
01:04:32.108 --> 01:04:34.268
Anne, someone here to see you.

919
01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.907
Anne, dear.
Your quick thinking...


920
01:04:47.147 --> 01:04:49.587
...may have saved
my little girl's life.


921
01:04:50.227 --> 01:04:53.707
I think you are a wonderful
brave girl...


922
01:04:53.947 --> 01:04:56.627
...and I hope that you and
Diana can still be good friends.


923
01:04:57.747 --> 01:04:59.067
What do you say?

924
01:04:59.627 --> 01:05:02.547
Mrs. Barry, I want you to know
I harbor no ill feelings of...


925
01:05:02.787 --> 01:05:03.907
...any sort.

926
01:05:04.187 --> 01:05:06.067
Thanks be to goodness for that.

927
01:05:06.307 --> 01:05:09.987
Henceforth I shall cover the past
with a mantle of oblivion.


928
01:05:10.427 --> 01:05:11.467
Thank you.

929
01:05:15.467 --> 01:05:18.987
My Diana couldn't have
a more fit bosom friend.


930
01:05:26.026 --> 01:05:28.146
Come now,
the barn is a little dusty.


931
01:05:29.306 --> 01:05:32.346
Good bye, Marilla.
Say my best to Matthew.


932
01:05:52.226 --> 01:05:53.746
Come on. That's it.

933
01:05:54.786 --> 01:05:55.986
Come on.

934
01:05:58.746 --> 01:05:59.826
Come on.

935
01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:12.025
Marilla, I've milked the cow
and fed the chickens.


936
01:06:12.265 --> 01:06:14.145
Please, may I go tobogganing
with my friends?


937
01:06:14.385 --> 01:06:15.745
The sun's barely up.

938
01:06:15.985 --> 01:06:18.225
Please. It's so beautiful outside.

939
01:06:19.345 --> 01:06:20.426
Be home in time for dinner.

940
01:06:20.665 --> 01:06:22.425
I will. Thank you!

941
01:06:27.065 --> 01:06:29.025
Diana, wait!

942
01:06:38.265 --> 01:06:40.025
What are you so owly about?

943
01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:43.305
Did she say where they were going?

944
01:06:44.105 --> 01:06:46.305
- Tobogganing.
- I know that, but where?


945
01:06:46.785 --> 01:06:49.865
The best tobogganing hills are
around the Cochand's pond.


946
01:06:51.105 --> 01:06:54.705
And the ice's certain spots are
so thin at this time of the year.


947
01:06:56.264 --> 01:06:58.104
May be better hitch up Harry.

948
01:07:01.824 --> 01:07:02.824
Come on, Harry.

949
01:07:07.704 --> 01:07:09.024
Come on, boy.

950
01:07:27.824 --> 01:07:29.424
Wanna see something strange?

951
01:07:29.904 --> 01:07:31.864
- What?
- Come on, I'll show you.


952
01:07:32.344 --> 01:07:34.144
- What's it?
- Upsidedown Man.


953
01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:36.280
It's only a stupid joke.
Somebody does it every year.


954
01:07:36.304 --> 01:07:37.944
- It's no joke.
- Of course it is.


955
01:07:38.184 --> 01:07:39.304
Dare you to find out?

956
01:07:39.544 --> 01:07:42.344
No, Josie Pye, we're not allowed
to pond. You know that.


957
01:07:42.584 --> 01:07:44.063
It's been frozen solid for a month.

958
01:07:44.303 --> 01:07:45.504
Josie Pye, don't you tell lie.

959
01:07:45.543 --> 01:07:46.583
I'll do it.

960
01:07:46.823 --> 01:07:48.463
No, You don't have to do anything.

961
01:07:48.703 --> 01:07:50.863
Does so. I dared her.
So she has to.


962
01:07:51.103 --> 01:07:52.623
It's all right.
Really, I don't mind.


963
01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:56.543
Besides, every challenge
is an adventure.


964
01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:10.663
Wow.

965
01:08:12.343 --> 01:08:14.703
I can see all the way down
to the bottom.


966
01:08:16.303 --> 01:08:17.703
It's wonderful.

967
01:08:21.703 --> 01:08:23.983
It's like being in
a glass bottom boat.


968
01:08:25.623 --> 01:08:27.383
Whoo Harry!

969
01:08:41.502 --> 01:08:43.182
- Help!
- Oh my gosh!


970
01:08:43.422 --> 01:08:46.222
Help, please! Get someone!

971
01:08:46.462 --> 01:08:50.342
Anybody, get someone!
It's so cold, please!


972
01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:53.102
I'm cold! I can't get out!
- Hold on!


973
01:08:53.342 --> 01:08:55.303
- Get somebody!
- You kids, get back from the ice!


974
01:08:55.342 --> 01:08:57.102
Get back!
- Get away!


975
01:08:57.342 --> 01:09:00.062
- Oh my gosh! Please!
- Come on!


976
01:09:01.022 --> 01:09:03.462
- Stay come now, Miss Anne.
- You're gonna be okay!


977
01:09:03.702 --> 01:09:05.942
Please! Come faster!

978
01:09:06.222 --> 01:09:08.302
I'm cold, please! Faster!

979
01:09:08.942 --> 01:09:13.142
Matthew! Matthew, come on, please!
I can't get out!


980
01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:16.502
I know! Please!
- Hang on there.


981
01:09:17.981 --> 01:09:21.701
I'm stuck! Please!

982
01:09:23.021 --> 01:09:26.181
Hold on, Kindred Spirit,
I'm gonna get you out.


983
01:09:27.421 --> 01:09:30.821
I know, please!
Matthew, please!


984
01:09:31.661 --> 01:09:32.701
Matthew!

985
01:09:32.941 --> 01:09:37.221
Okay. Reach out.
I'm almost there.


986
01:09:37.621 --> 01:09:43.621
Yes, girl, reach out!
Yes! Miss Anne with an "e". Yes!


987
01:09:46.261 --> 01:09:49.141
Anne, what were you thinking
going out on the ice like that?


988
01:09:49.381 --> 01:09:51.941
Imagine what would have happened
if Matthew hadn't sensed it.


989
01:09:52.181 --> 01:09:54.381
And not just to you.
To him as well.


990
01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:57.261
He shouldn't be doing dangerous
things like that at his age.


991
01:09:57.501 --> 01:09:58.782
Of course it's not stopping him.

992
01:09:58.981 --> 01:10:01.181
I was foolish Marilla.
I was. I know that now.


993
01:10:01.381 --> 01:10:03.460
And I won't do anything like it
ever again.


994
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.260
All right, well. 
You're normal.

995
01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.180
At least your temperature
seems to be.


996
01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.860
Now, I want you to lie down.

997
01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.780
I want you to not to imagine
things, not to be thinking...


998
01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.381
...and I want you to try to
get some sleep. Can you do that?


999
01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.020
- I will, promise.
- All right.


1000
01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:35.420
Where did you get them?

1001
01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:36.821
I pick 'em up now and then...

1002
01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:39.900
...whenever I go walking along
the sea shore.


1003
01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:42.420
They're beautiful.

1004
01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.860
Now, tell me all about
this concert of yours.


1005
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:49.180
We're going to have six choruses
and Diana is to sing a solo.


1006
01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.979
And I'm to perform
as the Queen of the Fairies.


1007
01:10:52.699 --> 01:10:55.099
Josie Pye said she'd never
heard of a red-headed fairy...


1008
01:10:55.339 --> 01:10:57.219
...but I don't let myself mind
what Josie says.


1009
01:10:57.459 --> 01:10:59.180
Well, I reckon it'll be a darn
good concert.


1010
01:10:59.419 --> 01:11:01.059
You'll do your part just fine.

1011
01:11:02.379 --> 01:11:03.779
Look.

1012
01:11:05.659 --> 01:11:06.899
Can I show you?

1013
01:11:10.379 --> 01:11:12.299
Remember the dress I was telling
you about?


1014
01:11:13.939 --> 01:11:16.499
Diana already sent away
for one just like it.


1015
01:11:23.259 --> 01:11:24.379
Matthew?

1016
01:11:24.939 --> 01:11:26.339
Hello Rachel.

1017
01:11:27.619 --> 01:11:28.659
How are you doing?

1018
01:11:28.899 --> 01:11:30.739
Fair to middling. And yourself?

1019
01:11:30.979 --> 01:11:34.019
I'm all right. Marilla told me
you wanted to see me.


1020
01:11:35.139 --> 01:11:36.739
Well now, Rachel...

1021
01:11:36.939 --> 01:11:40.698
...I know I have not always been
the most sociable neighbor.


1022
01:11:40.938 --> 01:11:43.898
- There's a truth to that.
- I want a fresh start.


1023
01:11:44.138 --> 01:11:46.218
That's charming likely,
Matthew Cuthbert.


1024
01:11:46.498 --> 01:11:48.018
What you want is my help.

1025
01:11:48.658 --> 01:11:50.378
And for what, pray tell?

1026
01:11:50.618 --> 01:11:53.618
You know, I have always admire
your sewing skills.


1027
01:11:58.538 --> 01:12:00.538
Just try this.

1028
01:12:01.658 --> 01:12:03.458
Not the red balls.
Gold ones.


1029
01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:04.778
All right.

1030
01:12:08.498 --> 01:12:10.098
How are we doing in over here?

1031
01:12:14.338 --> 01:12:15.378
Yes, that's fine.

1032
01:12:15.618 --> 01:12:17.099
Diana, can you give me
another ribbon?


1033
01:12:18.098 --> 01:12:19.578
Give me that.

1034
01:12:22.898 --> 01:12:24.417
Why you're here?

1035
01:12:25.297 --> 01:12:26.857
For your safety.

1036
01:12:28.857 --> 01:12:30.377
Thank you, Gilbert.

1037
01:12:39.377 --> 01:12:43.137
Here, put that over there. There's
big space over there. You see that?


1038
01:12:43.737 --> 01:12:45.897
Excuse me, Anne.

1039
01:12:46.337 --> 01:12:48.457
Since the concert is tomorrow
I thought you like...


1040
01:12:48.657 --> 01:12:50.337
...your Christmas present early.

1041
01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:52.017
Matthew Cuthbert, what on earth?

1042
01:12:52.257 --> 01:12:53.937
I didn't want to bother you,
Marilla.


1043
01:12:54.617 --> 01:12:56.737
You get your hands full
all the time.


1044
01:12:56.977 --> 01:12:58.977
So, I spoke with Rachel.

1045
01:12:59.217 --> 01:13:00.897
So that was what all that
was about.


1046
01:13:01.137 --> 01:13:02.857
Yes, go on. Open it.

1047
01:13:21.976 --> 01:13:23.656
Matthew.

1048
01:13:25.656 --> 01:13:28.296
Yeah, this is a...

1049
01:13:28.896 --> 01:13:30.816
- It's a pintuck.
- Pintuck. And this is...


1050
01:13:31.016 --> 01:13:32.096
What do you call this?

1051
01:13:32.296 --> 01:13:35.776
- A ruffle.
- Ruffle. And those are the sleeves.


1052
01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:38.256
Puffed sleeves
you've always wanted.


1053
01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:41.976
I've never had a pretty dress
in my life.


1054
01:13:48.256 --> 01:13:49.696
Are you coming to the concert?

1055
01:13:49.936 --> 01:13:52.896
Well, you know, I read my bible
and say my prayers...


1056
01:13:53.136 --> 01:13:55.376
...but being in a small room
with a bunch of farmers...


1057
01:13:55.616 --> 01:13:57.415
...it's not my idea of
Christian fellers.


1058
01:13:57.655 --> 01:14:00.415
If it's all the same to you,
I would prefer to imagine it.


1059
01:14:01.975 --> 01:14:03.615
Thank you, Matthew.

1060
01:14:03.855 --> 01:14:04.855
Merry Christmas.

1061
01:14:05.095 --> 01:14:07.175
Now, go upstairs
and try it on, why don't you?


1062
01:14:09.935 --> 01:14:12.071
Matthew Cuthbert, sometimes
I think I don't understand...


1063
01:14:12.095 --> 01:14:13.575
...the first thing about you.

1064
01:14:13.775 --> 01:14:16.615
A young girl should have a
pretty dress in my opinion.


1065
01:14:17.975 --> 01:14:20.535
I believe that's the first
opinion you've ever had.


1066
01:14:20.775 --> 01:14:23.855
No. It's the first opinion I've
ever had out loud.


1067
01:14:27.335 --> 01:14:29.815
Merry Christmas, Marilla.
God bless you.


1068
01:14:30.935 --> 01:14:32.655
Merry Christmas, Matthew.

1069
01:14:49.214 --> 01:14:51.734
Yes, they worked hard.

1070
01:14:53.734 --> 01:14:56.454
I know, it's true.
I am sure it will be good.


1071
01:14:56.654 --> 01:14:58.254
You're right. Thank you.

1072
01:15:09.894 --> 01:15:12.014
Welcome to the concert
this evening.


1073
01:15:20.014 --> 01:15:23.974
Smile and flap your wings.
Just like that.


1074
01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:31.333
Come follow, follow me.

1075
01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:33.733
You, fairy elves that be...

1076
01:15:33.973 --> 01:15:36.293
...which circle on the green.

1077
01:15:36.773 --> 01:15:39.413
Come follow Mab your queen.

1078
01:16:48.252 --> 01:16:49.572
Good morning, Muriel.

1079
01:16:51.452 --> 01:16:52.692
Today's a borrowed day.

1080
01:16:52.932 --> 01:16:54.932
Yes, indeed. Spring has well
and truly sprung.


1081
01:16:55.172 --> 01:16:56.893
Rachel said there was something
here for me.


1082
01:16:57.012 --> 01:17:00.332
Indeed there is. From the
Presbyterian Orphan Homes.


1083
01:17:03.572 --> 01:17:04.811
Take a look inside.

1084
01:17:05.051 --> 01:17:06.851
They have already paid for
the train ticket.


1085
01:17:10.571 --> 01:17:14.131
It must be a shock to finally
have the whole thing done with.


1086
01:17:14.371 --> 01:17:16.371
I can't imagine your relief.

1087
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:29.731
I got a letter from Mrs. Haines
in Charlottetown.


1088
01:17:31.491 --> 01:17:35.171
Remember, that Presbyterian outfit.

1089
01:17:38.371 --> 01:17:40.331
They've found a home for Anne.

1090
01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:43.411
They sent a train ticket.

1091
01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:47.011
When?

1092
01:17:48.131 --> 01:17:49.331
Tomorrow.

1093
01:17:50.971 --> 01:17:52.010
Tomorrow?

1094
01:17:56.130 --> 01:18:00.370
They says it's a real good family.
In Montreal. Very well off.


1095
01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:05.210
They've got four children,
all around the Anne's age.


1096
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:11.290
It's the best thing for her,
Matthew.


1097
01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:15.730
It's a great opportunity for her.

1098
01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.370
Anne.

1099
01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:29.650
It's all right, Marilla.

1100
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:33.570
Thank you for letting me stay
at Green Gables.


1101
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:36.650
Even if it was just for a while.

1102
01:18:37.890 --> 01:18:40.369
I never felt truly at home
before this.


1103
01:18:42.529 --> 01:18:44.169
Good night, Marilla.

1104
01:18:51.849 --> 01:18:53.249
Good night, Anne.

1105
01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:42.167
Marilla?

1106
01:20:42.927 --> 01:20:45.007
Marilla Cuthbert, where are you?

1107
01:20:47.527 --> 01:20:48.727
Marilla?

1108
01:20:52.927 --> 01:20:53.967
Marilla?

1109
01:20:54.207 --> 01:20:55.687
Rachel, I was just...

1110
01:20:55.927 --> 01:20:58.686
Marilla. You know I'm the
last person to ever offer advice.


1111
01:20:58.926 --> 01:20:59.926
That goes without saying.

1112
01:21:00.166 --> 01:21:02.607
But I'm ordering you to go after
that girl and bring her back.


1113
01:21:03.286 --> 01:21:04.966
Mrs. Beatty has found her
a real family.


1114
01:21:05.206 --> 01:21:06.327
One that can look after her.

1115
01:21:06.526 --> 01:21:07.846
Aren't you a real family?

1116
01:21:08.126 --> 01:21:11.006
You and Matthew? You belong to her.
And she belongs to you.


1117
01:21:11.286 --> 01:21:13.607
Now you go after that girl
and bring her home, do you hear?


1118
01:21:14.126 --> 01:21:16.206
It's too late.
It's already set in motion.


1119
01:21:16.446 --> 01:21:18.606
Rubbish. It's never too late to do
the right thing.


1120
01:21:18.846 --> 01:21:21.247
Now, let's get going. Thomas is
right outside with the buggy.


1121
01:21:36.606 --> 01:21:40.286
So, a government fellow
from the Agriculture Department...


1122
01:21:40.526 --> 01:21:42.086
...was at post office
the other day.


1123
01:21:42.326 --> 01:21:43.886
We're talking about
this and that...


1124
01:21:44.486 --> 01:21:47.885
...I asked him about
what makes the roads red.


1125
01:21:48.125 --> 01:21:51.325
He told me it was the iron
what did it.


1126
01:21:56.565 --> 01:21:58.725
I found this very interesting.

1127
01:22:24.365 --> 01:22:25.485
Anne!

1128
01:22:30.965 --> 01:22:33.284
I know they've found you a
real good family.


1129
01:22:33.724 --> 01:22:37.524
And they're gonna be able to
give you lots of things that we...


1130
01:22:37.764 --> 01:22:39.125
...Matthew and me
couldn't provide.


1131
01:22:40.124 --> 01:22:41.524
But the fact is...

1132
01:22:44.644 --> 01:22:46.564
...we've come to think of you
as family.


1133
01:22:51.524 --> 01:22:54.244
And now, I can't imagine life at
Green Gables without you.


1134
01:22:57.684 --> 01:22:59.484
I don't want to imagine it.

1135
01:23:00.124 --> 01:23:01.284
So...

1136
01:23:04.204 --> 01:23:07.204
...how would you feel about
come and live with us...


1137
01:23:08.364 --> 01:23:09.564
...for good?

1138
01:23:18.324 --> 01:23:20.003
All right now, dear. All right.

1139
01:23:20.883 --> 01:23:23.523
Get control of yourself. All right.

1140
01:23:24.123 --> 01:23:26.963
Okay. Let's not overdo
the theatrics.


1141
01:23:42.403 --> 01:23:45.643
Anne of Green Gables!
Lights out, young lady.


1142
01:23:49.723 --> 01:23:52.363
Anne of Green Gables.
