1
00:00:06.598 --> 00:00:07.682
Dear Santa,

2
00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:08.725
how are you?

3
00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:10.685
I'm not doing so well.

4
00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:12.312
There's this really,

5
00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:13.396
really bad man

6
00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:14.981
named Ebner Frost

7
00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:16.650
who lives up on the hill.

8
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.527
He's got these weird people

9
00:00:18.527 --> 00:00:19.653
working for him,

10
00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:20.820
and I think they're gonna

11
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.988
do something really bad

12
00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.281
this Christmas.

13
00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.499
Ho ho ho.

14
00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.668
Ho ho ho.

15
00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.294
Ho ho ho.

16
00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:37.420
I don't want anything

17
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.505
for me this Christmas,

18
00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.507
Santa, but things have been

19
00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.509
kind of hard for my friends

20
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:44.844
and the people in my town.

21
00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.263
Mr. Frost and his men

22
00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:47.806
have been real bullies

23
00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:50.141
to everyone in Lakeville.

24
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:52.143
That's where I live.

25
00:00:52.143 --> 00:00:54.187
We used to be a happy town,

26
00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.481
but now people are moving away

27
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:58.108
'cause Mr. Frost has been

28
00:00:58.108 --> 00:00:59.526
so mean to them.

29
00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.194
And now he's trying

30
00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.404
to take our Orphanage

31
00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:03.488
away from us

32
00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:05.532
and nobody can stop him!

33
00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:07.158
It might not be much,

34
00:01:07.158 --> 00:01:08.660
but it's the only home

35
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.245
we know.

36
00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:11.871
I know you're really busy

37
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.206
this time of year,

38
00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.249
but I just thought

39
00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:15.584
that since you're going

40
00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:16.960
to be in the neighborhood

41
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.295
anyway, maybe you could

42
00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:19.504
stop by a little early

43
00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:20.714
this year and help us.

44
00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:22.048
If Rudolph or your other

45
00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:23.508
reindeer aren't ready,

46
00:01:23.508 --> 00:01:24.968
you could take a car

47
00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:26.052
or a bike or..

48
00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.095
Hey, you,

49
00:01:27.095 --> 00:01:28.179
come back here!

50
00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.223
That's

51
00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.224
our Christmas Tree!

52
00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.393
Hey, come back here!

53
00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.186
I'm afraid that,

54
00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:36.771
with the way things are going,

55
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:37.772
this might be

56
00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:39.107
the last Christmas I spend

57
00:01:39.107 --> 00:01:40.567
with my friends.

58
00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.235
I know it's only a few days

59
00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:43.320
until Christmas,

60
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.030
but please hurry.

61
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.823
Yours truly,

62
00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:50.702
Elizabeth Bentley Walsh.

63
00:01:50.702 --> 00:01:53.622
P.S., I hope you're

64
00:01:53.622 --> 00:01:56.875
really out there, Santa.

65
00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:31.910
Never stop to smell

66
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.454
the roses!

67
00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:55.183
Aaaaah!

68
00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:00.689
Aah!

69
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.113
Ha ha.

70
00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:34.764
Free omelet.

71
00:03:34.764 --> 00:03:37.142
Very nice.

72
00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.777
Aah!

73
00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.707
Time.

74
00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:01.708
Four minutes...

75
00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.251
23 seconds.

76
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:05.378
Robe.

77
00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:07.630
How did I do?

78
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.423
Oh, great!

79
00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:09.549
Wonderful, Boss!

80
00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:10.675
Tremendous. Magnificent!

81
00:04:10.675 --> 00:04:11.676
You're the best.

82
00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:12.927
Weasels.

83
00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:14.220
If you guys are bucking

84
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.472
for a Christmas bonus,

85
00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:16.598
forget it.

86
00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:22.562
4:23? You call that exercise?

87
00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:23.646
Better cut down

88
00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:25.064
on my cholesterol.

89
00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:26.566
Yes, Sir.

90
00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.281
Oh... Make a note, Chas.

91
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:34.866
My picture on the can

92
00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:37.577
isn't big enough.

93
00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:38.745
And have then make me

94
00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:39.788
more tan.

95
00:04:42.832 --> 00:04:44.542
Yes? Of course.

96
00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:46.044
Straightaway.

97
00:04:46.044 --> 00:04:47.670
You guests have arrived, Sir.

98
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.964
Figures. Business always

99
00:04:49.964 --> 00:04:52.258
calls when you're having fun.

100
00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:53.927
Hmm. That should be

101
00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:56.137
another one of Blake's Rules.

102
00:04:56.137 --> 00:04:57.680
Make a note, Chas.

103
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.058
Make it rule number...

104
00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:01.935
What number are we up to now?

105
00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:04.312
385.

106
00:05:04.312 --> 00:05:06.147
Right. Make it 386..

107
00:05:06.147 --> 00:05:07.524
"Never mix business

108
00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:09.609
with pleasure."

109
00:05:09.609 --> 00:05:11.569
Ooh, I'm hot today!

110
00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:12.779
Better write that one

111
00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.114
down, Chas.

112
00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:16.074
The rules are important, Guys.

113
00:05:16.074 --> 00:05:17.492
What would we have

114
00:05:17.492 --> 00:05:19.327
without Blake's Rules, anyway?

115
00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:20.411
Fun.

116
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:22.622
Chaos, Mr. Thorne.

117
00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:26.292
We would have chaos.

118
00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:27.794
Pierre, rule number 105.

119
00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.129
Yes, Sir! "Never give

120
00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.505
an inch, especially when

121
00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:31.589
you can take one."

122
00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.133
Franco, 91?

123
00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.343
"Never lend a hand.

124
00:05:35.343 --> 00:05:37.303
You might need it later."

125
00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:39.806
Which reminds me, Sir...

126
00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.558
One of those nonprofit

127
00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:43.810
organizations called inquiring

128
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.812
about a Christmas Fundraiser

129
00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:46.938
they want to hold here

130
00:05:46.938 --> 00:05:48.147
at the mansion.

131
00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:50.400
After all, it is Christmas.

132
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.485
Haven't you learned anything?

133
00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:53.820
If you give them a taste,

134
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.363
they want more.

135
00:05:55.363 --> 00:05:56.823
If you want to do them a favor,

136
00:05:56.823 --> 00:05:58.074
send them some of those

137
00:05:58.074 --> 00:05:59.159
carbohydrate bars

138
00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.702
that aren't selling anyway,

139
00:06:00.702 --> 00:06:02.078
and Chas, don't forget..

140
00:06:02.078 --> 00:06:03.329
To write it off, Sir.

141
00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:05.456
Good man, Chas.

142
00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:06.833
Okay, Guys, let's go kick

143
00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.711
some paintball butt.

144
00:06:18.052 --> 00:06:20.013
Let's roll!

145
00:06:20.013 --> 00:06:21.139
We're outta here!

146
00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:22.223
Guys, let's hit it!

147
00:06:22.223 --> 00:06:23.850
All right!

148
00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:36.946
I'm gonna get him!

149
00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:39.490
Watch out!

150
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:46.372
Blake, come on!

151
00:06:47.832 --> 00:06:50.335
They are gonna be history.

152
00:06:52.337 --> 00:06:53.379
Of course before

153
00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:54.714
the time limit runs out,

154
00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:56.049
but you still have to get

155
00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:57.425
the other team's flag.

156
00:06:57.425 --> 00:07:00.261
That about covers it. Ready?

157
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.346
Ready?

158
00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.474
Never trust the enemy, Captain.

159
00:07:04.474 --> 00:07:05.808
Hey, that's not fair!

160
00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:07.226
Get him!

161
00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:10.355
Too rich and too quick.

162
00:07:16.778 --> 00:07:21.157
Boop boop boop boop.

163
00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:26.871
Boop boop boop boop ehhhnk!

164
00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:32.669
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo ehhhnk!

165
00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.923
Gotcha.

166
00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:41.761
Aah!

167
00:07:48.142 --> 00:07:49.727
Sheriff! I mean, Dispatch!

168
00:07:49.727 --> 00:07:50.728
We got massive guns

169
00:07:50.728 --> 00:07:51.729
out here on 43.

170
00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:53.106
It must be Militia

171
00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:54.190
or terrorists!

172
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.566
Send everything you got!

173
00:07:55.566 --> 00:07:57.610
I'm rolling! Come on, Baby!

174
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.129
Hey, why don't you

175
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:17.171
just pull over?

176
00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:18.631
Rule number 20..

177
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:20.008
"Never Surrender."

178
00:08:20.008 --> 00:08:22.301
Besides, this is fun.

179
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:25.263
Give me your paint gun.

180
00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:29.851
Sorry.

181
00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:31.811
Idiot.

182
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:33.521
Hey. Hey!

183
00:08:33.521 --> 00:08:36.149
Watch it! Watch it!

184
00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:57.211
We'll lose them in Lakeville.

185
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:58.588
There's a million places

186
00:08:58.588 --> 00:08:59.589
to hide.

187
00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:00.590
I grew up there.

188
00:09:46.177 --> 00:09:47.303
Do we have any news

189
00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:48.388
on Mr. Claus?

190
00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:49.639
No, but I got a midget

191
00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:51.015
in a clown suit.

192
00:09:51.015 --> 00:09:53.684
Great.

193
00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.125
Rule number 21:

194
00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:18.960
"When in doubt, get out."

195
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.962
Later.

196
00:10:32.974 --> 00:10:34.976
Santa! Santa!

197
00:10:34.976 --> 00:10:38.646
Santa! Santa! Santa!

198
00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:44.610
No, don't worry about it.

199
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.736
I raise you one king.

200
00:10:45.736 --> 00:10:47.363
How's it looking out there?

201
00:10:47.363 --> 00:10:48.447
Pretty bad?

202
00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.575
Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no problem.

203
00:10:50.575 --> 00:10:51.617
It's no problem.

204
00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:53.244
I just ran into a streak

205
00:10:53.244 --> 00:10:54.579
of bad luck, that's all.

206
00:10:54.579 --> 00:10:55.997
I'll have the money for you

207
00:10:55.997 --> 00:10:57.790
today, I promise. Uh...

208
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.251
Listen up. I've got 50 bucks

209
00:11:00.251 --> 00:11:01.669
for the first elf

210
00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:05.923
that brings me Santa Claus.

211
00:11:05.923 --> 00:11:07.133
We can do that, huh?

212
00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.259
It appears my luck

213
00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:09.802
may have just changed.

214
00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:12.054
I'll call you.

215
00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:16.809
Receive payment from Lenny

216
00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:18.436
today, or cause

217
00:11:18.436 --> 00:11:22.106
mass hemorrhaging.

218
00:11:22.106 --> 00:11:23.733
Hi! I'm Dr. Blight,

219
00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:25.818
Mr. Frost's personal physician.

220
00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.153
Mr. Frost will be with you

221
00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:28.487
in just a moment.

222
00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.990
Comfortable?

223
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.366
Get me out of here!

224
00:11:32.366 --> 00:11:34.535
Get me down!

225
00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:40.166
Anything I can get you?

226
00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.835
Coffee, tea, aspirin?

227
00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.212
Eh...

228
00:11:44.212 --> 00:11:46.881
Good. Enjoy!

229
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:49.342
Hey, what are you doing?

230
00:11:49.342 --> 00:11:50.593
Let me down!

231
00:11:53.387 --> 00:11:56.682
Mr. Rapini, I'm Ebner Frost.

232
00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:58.518
I'm so glad you could make it.

233
00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:00.186
I do hope we can reach

234
00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:01.521
an agreement on the sale

235
00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:03.022
of your shoe store.

236
00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:04.065
I'm not selling

237
00:12:04.065 --> 00:12:06.609
my shoe store!

238
00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:09.570
Get me out of here!

239
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.696
Where are you going?

240
00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:12.698
No! Don't leave me!

241
00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:15.701
Chump.

242
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.578
How unfortunate.

243
00:12:17.578 --> 00:12:19.580
Well, since you're going

244
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.706
to be hanging around

245
00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:23.209
a while, let me introduce you

246
00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:25.378
to my staff of scientists.

247
00:12:25.378 --> 00:12:27.004
Don't be disturbed by the fact

248
00:12:27.004 --> 00:12:28.339
they've been kicked out

249
00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:29.590
of some of the finest

250
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.467
universities in the world.

251
00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:32.843
They've always just been

252
00:12:32.843 --> 00:12:35.054
a little ahead of their time...

253
00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:37.265
And the law.

254
00:12:37.265 --> 00:12:38.641
Allow me to introduce you

255
00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:40.393
to the world-renowned

256
00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:42.853
geologist, Mr. Flint.

257
00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:50.820
Nice to meet ya.

258
00:12:55.575 --> 00:12:57.118
You are going to make

259
00:12:57.118 --> 00:12:59.787
such an interesting fossil.

260
00:12:59.787 --> 00:13:01.789
Canadian chemist,

261
00:13:01.789 --> 00:13:03.916
Mr. Vial.

262
00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.423
Some find the scent

263
00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:12.633
of methane gas offensive,

264
00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:14.593
but I like to think of it

265
00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:18.264
as nature's perfume.

266
00:13:19.724 --> 00:13:20.766
The electrifyingly

267
00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:23.436
beautiful Ms. Watt.

268
00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:43.581
Ah! Spring!

269
00:13:43.581 --> 00:13:45.082
I'll give you all a chance

270
00:13:45.082 --> 00:13:47.126
to get acquainted.

271
00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:21.744
Did we look that way?

272
00:14:21.744 --> 00:14:22.953
I don't know where he went.

273
00:14:22.953 --> 00:14:24.121
I can't believe it.

274
00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:25.498
Come on! Let's try over here.

275
00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.051
Man!

276
00:14:41.222 --> 00:14:43.516
Oh, excuse me, Santa.

277
00:14:43.516 --> 00:14:45.017
You haven't seen some crazy guy

278
00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:46.477
in army fatigues come through

279
00:14:46.477 --> 00:14:47.687
here, have you?

280
00:14:47.687 --> 00:14:48.729
Well, no, Officer,

281
00:14:48.729 --> 00:14:49.814
nothing like that.

282
00:14:49.814 --> 00:14:52.441
Well, uh, keep your eyes peeled

283
00:14:52.441 --> 00:14:54.693
and Merry Christmas.

284
00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:57.238
Ho ho ho.

285
00:14:57.238 --> 00:14:59.323
Now, we know this joker

286
00:14:59.323 --> 00:15:00.324
is around here...

287
00:15:00.324 --> 00:15:01.367
Idiots.

288
00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:02.493
How do we find this guy?

289
00:15:02.493 --> 00:15:03.661
We gotta just throw a cover

290
00:15:03.661 --> 00:15:04.704
over this thing

291
00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:06.038
and smoke him out.

292
00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:07.123
Santa, I thought

293
00:15:07.123 --> 00:15:08.332
I missed you!

294
00:15:08.332 --> 00:15:09.333
Yeah. If you hurry,

295
00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:10.334
you still can.

296
00:15:10.334 --> 00:15:12.753
Do you have a minute?

297
00:15:12.753 --> 00:15:14.547
Fax me, you little brat.

298
00:15:16.841 --> 00:15:19.427
That's weird.

299
00:15:19.427 --> 00:15:23.055
Th-that's him. Freeze!

300
00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.557
Let's get him!

301
00:15:31.355 --> 00:15:34.233
All right, where'd he go,

302
00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:36.902
up the chimney?

303
00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.070
I think he's up

304
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.530
in the air conditioning ducts.

305
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.948
The ducts! Did you see

306
00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:42.074
the size of that guy?

307
00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:43.075
I think he went

308
00:15:43.075 --> 00:15:44.076
underneath the floors.

309
00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:45.411
The floor?

310
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:46.412
This is a cement floor!

311
00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:47.413
Think, Barn!

312
00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:49.039
Oh, and your idea was better?

313
00:15:49.039 --> 00:15:50.040
Oh, yeah, sure.

314
00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.709
Somewhere.

315
00:15:51.709 --> 00:15:54.128
He can't just disappear.

316
00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.591
I'm not gonna be the one

317
00:15:58.591 --> 00:15:59.759
to tell the Chief

318
00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:00.760
we lost Santa.

319
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.261
No. I'm not gonna let

320
00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:03.596
this guy get away

321
00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:05.556
with Santa fraud.

322
00:16:05.556 --> 00:16:08.517
Come on!

323
00:16:11.187 --> 00:16:12.271
Morons.

324
00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:17.193
Ho ho no!

325
00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:25.451
Another drunk Mall Santa.

326
00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:30.498
Well, you'll do.

327
00:16:31.916 --> 00:16:33.626
You're a big one, aren't you?

328
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.341
Oh!

329
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:42.051
Ho ho!

330
00:16:44.428 --> 00:16:45.638
Merry Christmas!

331
00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:46.972
Very Merry Christmas!

332
00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:48.807
I'm rich!

333
00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:50.476
And Mr. Frost won't

334
00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:51.769
pulverize me.

335
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:53.395
And a snappy dresser, too.

336
00:16:53.395 --> 00:16:55.105
Why, don't mind if I do.

337
00:16:56.106 --> 00:16:58.192
Oh, answer to my prayers!

338
00:16:58.192 --> 00:16:59.193
Thank you!

339
00:16:59.193 --> 00:17:00.694
Thank you, Mr. Uh!!!

340
00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:04.031
Blake Thorne?

341
00:17:04.031 --> 00:17:06.825
Richest man... 
In ten states?

342
00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:09.036
Blake Thorne?

343
00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:11.121
Yeah!

344
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:13.040
Whoo! I'm rich!

345
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.416
I'm richer than rich!

346
00:17:14.416 --> 00:17:15.584
I'm too rich!

347
00:17:15.584 --> 00:17:16.835
Visa, Mastercard.

348
00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:18.504
American Express!

349
00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:20.381
A-whoo, a-whoo, a-whoo, a-whoo.

350
00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:22.341
Merry Christmas to all...

351
00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:24.510

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.041
To the North Pole!

360
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:57.710
Am I right?

361
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:58.711
You know, the kids

362
00:17:58.711 --> 00:17:59.712

363
00:17:59.712 --> 00:18:00.713
I'll take you there.

364
00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:01.714
We'd better hurry.

365
00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:03.215
Otherwise, you're gonna be

367
00:18:04.425 --> 00:18:05.884
Mr. Uh.. you know, I didn't

368
00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:06.885
catch your name.

369
00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:09.138
You okay?

370
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.269
I really don't remember.

371
00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:16.770
It's on the tip of my tongue.

372
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.771
Uh...

373
00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:19.064
Santa!

374
00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:20.357
What?

375
00:18:20.357 --> 00:18:22.693
You're Santa Claus. Santa!

376
00:18:22.693 --> 00:18:24.236
No. Yes!

377
00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:25.571
No. Yes!

378
00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:27.406
No. Yes! Hello!

379
00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:28.407
Look at you.

380
00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:29.533
Come here. Come here.

381
00:18:29.533 --> 00:18:30.743
Look! Who else would you be?

384
00:18:33.037 --> 00:18:34.079
you got the gloves.

385
00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.789
Hey, see? It's Christmastime.

386
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:37.291
Come here to spread a little

387
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:38.667

388
00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:39.668
Come on, Man.

389
00:18:39.668 --> 00:18:41.420
Uh, uh, I mean, Sir.

390
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.172
We have a lot work to do.

391
00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:45.674
Santa? Are you sure?

392
00:18:45.674 --> 00:18:46.800
Hey, who's the one

393
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.302
who got hit on the head, huh?

394
00:18:48.302 --> 00:18:49.303
Oh!

395
00:18:49.303 --> 00:18:50.304
Ooh, uh, sorry

396
00:18:50.304 --> 00:18:51.430

397
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.806
Let's go. I'll explain it

398
00:18:52.806 --> 00:18:53.807
to you on the way.

399
00:18:53.807 --> 00:18:54.808
Work with me.

400
00:18:54.808 --> 00:18:55.809
Here we go.

401
00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:56.810
Nice and easy.

402
00:18:57.811 --> 00:18:59.313
Oh oh oh!

403
00:18:59.313 --> 00:19:03.275
Ah! All right, I got ya.

404
00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:07.613
Santa! Santa! Santa!

405
00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:11.367
Losers, Santa.

406
00:19:11.367 --> 00:19:12.368
Santa, losers.

407
00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:13.535
Aw, man!

408
00:19:13.535 --> 00:19:14.536
Oh, gee!

409
00:19:14.536 --> 00:19:15.537
Okay, Big Guy.

410
00:19:15.537 --> 00:19:16.580
Now, you're on.

411
00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.915
Now, remember to smile,

412
00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:19.458
say "Ho ho ho" a lot,

413
00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.126
and most importantly,

414
00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:23.045
promise them anything.

415
00:19:23.045 --> 00:19:24.880
It's showtime.

416
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.173
Watch your head!

417
00:19:26.173 --> 00:19:28.300
Low ceiling coming out.

418
00:19:32.262 --> 00:19:35.641
They love you.

419
00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:38.977
Well, it's about time.

420
00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:42.147
Elf, take Santa to his throne!

421
00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:44.066
You're on.

422
00:19:59.873 --> 00:20:02.459
Santa, his first name.

423
00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:05.337
Who are you?

424
00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:08.507
David. You knew that.

425
00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:11.176
You been good this year?

426
00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:14.304
Yeah, sort of.

427
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:38.704
And, uh, what's your name,

428
00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:39.830
little girl?

429
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:40.873
Susan. And I want

430
00:20:40.873 --> 00:20:42.499

432
00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:44.877
cars, and a horse stable.

433
00:20:44.877 --> 00:20:45.878
And a new makeup set

434
00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:46.879
and a CD Walkman

435
00:20:46.879 --> 00:20:47.880
because my best friend

436
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.881
Kathy has one.

437
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:50.716
And a new Barbie doll.

438
00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:52.384
And...

439
00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:54.219
Smile.

440
00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.893
Smile.

441
00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:03.854
You look beautiful today,

442
00:21:03.854 --> 00:21:04.855
little girl.

443
00:21:04.855 --> 00:21:06.064
What can Santa get you

444
00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.066
for Christmas?

445
00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:08.734
Um... Um, you know,

446
00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:09.860
one of those.

447
00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.236
Oh, a golf ball.

448
00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:12.863
No.

449
00:21:12.863 --> 00:21:15.365
Uh, pocketknife.

450
00:21:15.365 --> 00:21:17.534
No.

451
00:21:17.534 --> 00:21:19.578
Electric razor?

452
00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:20.871
No.

453
00:21:20.871 --> 00:21:22.414
Hmm.

454
00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:24.833
Smile.

455
00:21:27.044 --> 00:21:28.796
Let go!

456
00:21:28.796 --> 00:21:29.880
I was here first!

457
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.006
No, you weren't!

458
00:21:31.006 --> 00:21:33.258
Santa! Get off me!

459
00:21:38.764 --> 00:21:41.308
Get the money. Go. Bye.

460
00:21:41.308 --> 00:21:42.643
Welcome, Mr. Thorne,

461
00:21:42.643 --> 00:21:44.353

462

-Secure Teller.

463
00:21:45.938 --> 00:21:47.648
Place your thumb on the scanner

464
00:21:47.648 --> 00:21:49.525
for fingerprint identification.

465
00:21:49.525 --> 00:21:50.526
Doh! No! No!

466
00:21:50.526 --> 00:21:51.860
I'm sorry, the user's

467
00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.278
thumbprint does not match

468
00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:54.279
Mr. Blake Thorne.

469
00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:56.156
I hate progress. No no no!

470
00:21:56.156 --> 00:21:57.157
How you doing?

471
00:21:57.157 --> 00:22:00.119
Little problem with the...

472
00:22:05.707 --> 00:22:07.209
Would you hurry up?

473
00:22:07.209 --> 00:22:08.669
My mom could've done this..

474
00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:10.128
Give me a hand, Genius.

475
00:22:10.128 --> 00:22:11.255
This thing's heavy.

476
00:22:11.255 --> 00:22:14.174
Hello. Afternoon, Ladies.

477
00:22:14.174 --> 00:22:15.175
Crap!

478
00:22:15.175 --> 00:22:16.218
Move, you tool.

479
00:22:16.218 --> 00:22:17.261
Hurry up.

480
00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:19.096
Now, pick up as much as you can.

481
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.268
What are you doing?

482
00:22:24.268 --> 00:22:26.270
We're Santa's Little Helpers,

483
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.980
and we're gonna take this money

484
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.314
to the Orphanage for him.

485
00:22:29.314 --> 00:22:30.315
Beat it, Kid.

486
00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:31.316
You are not!

487
00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:32.651
We are too!

488
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:34.194
Get lost before we tell Santa

489
00:22:34.194 --> 00:22:36.238
you're a bad little girl.

490
00:22:36.238 --> 00:22:39.449
Santa!!!

491
00:22:40.492 --> 00:22:41.493
You be good.

492
00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:43.036
Santa'll be right back.

493
00:22:43.036 --> 00:22:44.913
Okay.

494
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.171
Someone's been very naughty.

495
00:22:57.467 --> 00:22:58.719
What are you gonna do

496
00:22:58.719 --> 00:23:00.137
about it, Santa?

497
00:23:00.137 --> 00:23:02.097
Give me a lump of coal?

498
00:23:05.767 --> 00:23:06.768
Watch out!

499
00:23:06.768 --> 00:23:07.895
Santa, watch out!

500
00:23:07.895 --> 00:23:09.938
How about two lumps?

501
00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.072
Look, Santa's beating

502
00:23:19.072 --> 00:23:21.825
some guy up!

503
00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:25.495
Yay, Santa!

504
00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:39.218
Watch out, he's got

505
00:23:39.218 --> 00:23:41.637
a candy cane!

506
00:23:46.892 --> 00:23:48.685
Ow!

507
00:23:58.862 --> 00:24:00.155
You see, Kids?

508
00:24:00.155 --> 00:24:02.449
It pays to be nice.

509
00:24:02.449 --> 00:24:03.659
Anybody want to help

510
00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:04.743
Santa clean up?

511
00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:06.787
Yeah!

512
00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:12.000
That was very nice.

513
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.003
And he could be very helpful.

514
00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:18.256
Hey, hey, hey!

515
00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:19.424
Good work, Boss.

516
00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:20.717
I knew you had it in you.

517
00:24:20.717 --> 00:24:22.344
You know, I was gonna help you,

518
00:24:22.344 --> 00:24:24.137
but I, uh, you know.

519
00:24:24.137 --> 00:24:25.138
Anyway, hey.

520
00:24:25.138 --> 00:24:26.598
If you could just come over here

521
00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:27.599
for just a minute, there's

522
00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:29.351
something I'd like to show you.

523
00:24:29.351 --> 00:24:31.937
The Mission.

524
00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:33.188
They need help, Lenny.

525
00:24:33.188 --> 00:24:34.856
We should go.

526
00:24:34.856 --> 00:24:36.066
Yeah, yeah, we, uh,

527
00:24:36.066 --> 00:24:38.402
we, uh, we should go there...

528
00:24:38.402 --> 00:24:40.445
Someday. But first..

529
00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:42.864
We should go there.

530
00:24:42.864 --> 00:24:45.450
We should go right now.

531
00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:50.622
Excuse me. Pardon me.

532
00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:55.252
Got something nice for you.

533
00:24:55.252 --> 00:24:56.253
Come on, Santa.

534
00:24:56.253 --> 00:24:58.296
Go home!

535
00:24:58.296 --> 00:25:01.299
Don't you have parents?

536
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.141
You know,

537
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:10.559
you're absolutely right.

538
00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:12.060
The Mission could be kind of

539
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.395
like your local office.

540
00:25:13.395 --> 00:25:15.564
L-let's get outta here.

541
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:18.150
If I'm Santa,

542
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.192
where's my sleigh?

543
00:25:19.192 --> 00:25:21.153
It's getting new brakes,

544
00:25:21.153 --> 00:25:22.154
and Rudolph's got

545
00:25:22.154 --> 00:25:23.322
this stomach thing.

546
00:25:23.322 --> 00:25:26.074
I got something better.

547
00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:31.663
Let's ride!

548
00:25:36.168 --> 00:25:37.753
Bye, Santa!

549
00:25:37.753 --> 00:25:40.422
Oh, did you see that?

550
00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:43.717
Ahem. Here's the file

551
00:25:43.717 --> 00:25:46.720
on the Rapini sale, Sir.

552
00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:48.722
Did you...

553
00:25:48.722 --> 00:25:50.599
Get these disinfected?

554
00:25:50.599 --> 00:25:51.683
Do you have any idea

555
00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:53.018
how many germs can fester

556
00:25:53.018 --> 00:25:54.102
on a piece of paper?

557
00:25:55.312 --> 00:25:57.689
I've a feeling this Rapini

558
00:25:57.689 --> 00:26:00.108
fellow's not going to sell.

559
00:26:00.108 --> 00:26:01.860
I'll sell!

560
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.529
I'll sell! I'll sell!

561
00:26:04.529 --> 00:26:06.990
I'll sell! I'll sell!

562
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.700
I knew we could work things

563
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.036
out in an amicable manner.

564
00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:12.370
Oh, and remember to be out

565
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.830
by Christmas.

566
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.791
Thank you.

567
00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:18.251
Yes! Blight?

568
00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:22.589
Now our plans

569
00:26:22.589 --> 00:26:23.715
are almost complete.

570
00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.884
I still have one last headache.

571
00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:27.219
The Orphanage.

572
00:26:27.219 --> 00:26:28.303
Round up the troops

573
00:26:28.303 --> 00:26:29.679
and see if we can convince

574
00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:31.181
our little friends to adopt

575
00:26:31.181 --> 00:26:32.182
a new attitude.

576
00:26:33.683 --> 00:26:37.229
"Adopt!" That's a good one, Sir.

577
00:26:37.229 --> 00:26:40.816
Ahem. I'll just get the spray.

578
00:26:49.157 --> 00:26:50.575
You sure this scooter's

579
00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:54.037
gonna make it to the Orphanage?

580
00:27:07.092 --> 00:27:08.427
Doctor's note:

581
00:27:08.427 --> 00:27:10.762
Never let Flint drive.

582
00:27:46.339 --> 00:27:48.800
Good afternoon, Leslie.

583
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.302
What do you want?

584
00:27:50.302 --> 00:27:51.469
Oh, we just dropped by

585
00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:53.638
to see how your relocation

586
00:27:53.638 --> 00:27:54.639
plans are going.

587
00:27:56.433 --> 00:27:59.686
Any way we can be of help?

588
00:27:59.686 --> 00:28:01.563
You're so full of it.

589
00:28:01.563 --> 00:28:02.939
Just leave us alone.

590
00:28:02.939 --> 00:28:03.940
Why don't you just

591
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.275
disappear forever?

592
00:28:05.275 --> 00:28:06.276
We'll be around

593
00:28:06.276 --> 00:28:07.611
if you need us.

594
00:28:08.612 --> 00:28:10.030
Please, don't hesitate

595
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.032
to call me.

596
00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:16.494
In your dreams.

597
00:28:16.494 --> 00:28:18.663
Come inside, children.

598
00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:19.998
Wow!

599
00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:25.795
What are you staring at?

600
00:28:25.795 --> 00:28:27.714
Get back to work.

601
00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:39.100
What's going on?

602
00:28:41.603 --> 00:28:44.356
Where is he going?

603
00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:48.401
Get the heck outta here!

604
00:28:55.742 --> 00:28:56.868
Where do you get off

605
00:28:56.868 --> 00:28:58.036
coming to our homeless shelter?

606
00:28:58.036 --> 00:28:59.204
Be careful, Clay!

607
00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:00.205
You better stop there,

608
00:29:00.205 --> 00:29:01.248
or you're gonna have to..

609
00:29:01.248 --> 00:29:02.457
Come and get it!

610
00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:07.295
Don't! Oh!

611
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.265
Why aren't we moving?

612
00:29:18.265 --> 00:29:20.308
Arrrh!

613
00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.728
Wow!

614
00:29:33.446 --> 00:29:38.243
Merry Christmas, Santa!

615
00:29:41.871 --> 00:29:42.872
It's, uh...

616
00:29:42.872 --> 00:29:43.873
Santa! Cool!

617
00:29:43.873 --> 00:29:45.083
Yeah. Let's go!

618
00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:49.921
Santa!

619
00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:52.090
Wow, that was awesome!

620
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.426
How'd you do that?

621
00:29:58.471 --> 00:29:59.764
See, I told you Santa

622
00:29:59.764 --> 00:30:00.932
would answer my letter!

623
00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:03.101
Looks like we owe you

624
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.644
a debt, Mr., uh...

625
00:30:04.644 --> 00:30:05.979
Ahem.

626
00:30:05.979 --> 00:30:07.272
Uh, I guess you can

627
00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:08.940
call me Santa.

628
00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.442
Well, the least

629
00:30:10.442 --> 00:30:11.943
we can do is offer you dinner.

630
00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:12.944
Do you have time?

631
00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:14.070
Yeah!

632
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.447
Sure. They can't start

633
00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:16.948
Christmas without me.

634
00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:18.950
Can they?

635
00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:21.828
Santa, you saved

636
00:30:21.828 --> 00:30:23.246
my life, Man.

637
00:30:23.246 --> 00:30:25.081
I was a goner, Man.

638
00:30:33.673 --> 00:30:36.217
Santa, sit next to me!

639
00:30:38.595 --> 00:30:39.971
Here. I bet you had

640
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:41.848
a long trip.

641
00:30:41.848 --> 00:30:44.142
Thank you, um...

642
00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:45.143
Elizabeth.

643
00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:46.644
I wrote you the letter.

644
00:30:46.644 --> 00:30:48.313
I guess you get

645
00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:49.522
a lot of letters.

646
00:30:49.522 --> 00:30:51.441
Uh, I think so.

647
00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:53.902
Wait right there!

648
00:30:53.902 --> 00:30:56.321
I'll be right back.

649
00:30:57.989 --> 00:30:59.324
You have to cut Elizabeth

650
00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:00.450
some slack.. She still

651
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.660
believes in that stuff.

652
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.661
She also believes

653
00:31:02.661 --> 00:31:03.662
in the Tooth Fairy

654
00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:05.663
and the Easter Bunny.

655
00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:06.664
My name is Sarah,

656
00:31:06.664 --> 00:31:08.500
and that's Taylor.

657
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.335
Hey, Kid, how's it going?

658
00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:11.628
Lenny's my name.

659
00:31:15.382 --> 00:31:17.300
Hello, Santa.

660
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.301
I'm Leslie Morgan.

661
00:31:18.301 --> 00:31:19.302
I run this place...

662
00:31:19.302 --> 00:31:20.553
Or at least I try to, anyway.

663
00:31:20.553 --> 00:31:22.555
Thank you for what you did.

664
00:31:22.555 --> 00:31:24.182
That was a very stupid thing

665
00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:26.309
you did out there, Santa,

666
00:31:26.309 --> 00:31:27.519
but I'm glad you did.

667
00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:28.853
Hey, if had been 20 years

668
00:31:28.853 --> 00:31:30.146
younger, I'd have done

669
00:31:30.146 --> 00:31:31.815
the same myself!

670
00:31:32.982 --> 00:31:33.983
Hey, look here.

671
00:31:33.983 --> 00:31:35.693
Leslie, she may run this place,

672
00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:37.112
but I'm the one who keeps it

673
00:31:37.112 --> 00:31:38.113
in one piece.

674
00:31:38.113 --> 00:31:40.031
Clayton is the name.

675
00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:41.616
Well, thanks, everybody.

676
00:31:41.616 --> 00:31:43.493
I'm really glad to be here.

677
00:31:43.493 --> 00:31:47.705
I'm really not sure why...

678
00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:49.207
But I saw the sign at the mall

679
00:31:49.207 --> 00:31:51.292
and for some reason I thought

680
00:31:51.292 --> 00:31:53.545
I might be needed here.

681
00:31:57.424 --> 00:31:59.426
Who were those guys, anyway?

682
00:31:59.426 --> 00:32:00.510
The scientists?

683
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.719
Oh, they work for Mr. Frost.

684
00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:02.762
He's been clearing out

685
00:32:02.762 --> 00:32:04.097
the whole neighborhood,

686
00:32:04.097 --> 00:32:05.098
and no one knows why.

687
00:32:05.098 --> 00:32:06.599
Now he wants the Orphanage.

688
00:32:06.599 --> 00:32:09.352
And he'll get it, too.

689
00:32:09.352 --> 00:32:10.895
Shut up! He will not.

690
00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:11.896
Sounds like

691
00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:14.232
a very naughty boy.

692
00:32:15.442 --> 00:32:16.443
Oh!

693
00:32:16.443 --> 00:32:17.777
Oh ho ho, thank you!

694
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.907
What's the matter, Santa?

695
00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:24.993
Don't you like chocolate chip?

696
00:32:24.993 --> 00:32:26.870
I don't think so.

697
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.079
I mean, are these good

698
00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:29.706
for you with all the fat and...

699
00:32:29.706 --> 00:32:31.249
Santa, don't you remember

700
00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:33.418
you love cookies?

701
00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:35.003
Oh, yeah!

702
00:32:35.003 --> 00:32:36.421
Mrs. Claus has to hide them

703
00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:37.714
from him.. Otherwise,

704
00:32:37.714 --> 00:32:40.508
he blows up like a blimp. Ooh!

705
00:32:40.508 --> 00:32:41.759
Mm.

706
00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:44.262
Here, have some milk.

707
00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:45.763
Is this low-fat?

708
00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:48.391
Okay, everybody, let's set

709
00:32:48.391 --> 00:32:49.934
the table and wash.

710
00:32:49.934 --> 00:32:52.604
It's jerk chicken night!

711
00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:53.605
Yay! Whoo!

712
00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:55.940
Okay, everybody, let's march.

713
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.610
Let's march.

714
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:59.777
And the guy says...

715
00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.697
One of Santa's Helpers,

716
00:33:02.697 --> 00:33:04.282
and this guy's got a nose ring

717
00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:06.034
the size of a donut,

718
00:33:06.034 --> 00:33:07.410
you know what I'm saying?

719
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.411
Oh!

720
00:33:08.411 --> 00:33:09.746
Hey, hey, I'm talking

721
00:33:09.746 --> 00:33:10.872
jelly-filled here!

722
00:33:10.872 --> 00:33:12.457
So Santa decides to give them

723
00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:13.666
both an aerial tour

724
00:33:13.666 --> 00:33:16.503
of the North Pole. Whee!

725
00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:23.635
Hey, uh, Santa, uh,

726
00:33:23.635 --> 00:33:24.636
do you have a place

727
00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:26.095
to stay tonight?

728
00:33:26.095 --> 00:33:27.096
Leslie, can we

729
00:33:27.096 --> 00:33:28.473
keep him, please?

730
00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:30.975
Elizabeth, he's not a dog.

731
00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.477
Ruff ruff! What about me?

732
00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:34.312
All right, all right,

733
00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:35.813
but they're not going to be able

734
00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:37.148
to stay for long, Elizabeth.

735
00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:38.525
Christmas is only three days

736
00:33:38.525 --> 00:33:39.859
away, and Santa's going

737
00:33:39.859 --> 00:33:41.027
to be very busy.

738
00:33:41.027 --> 00:33:42.821
Yay! Thank you, Leslie.

739
00:33:42.821 --> 00:33:45.156
Yeah, well, we're pretty much

740
00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:46.616
closed down, anyways.

741
00:33:46.616 --> 00:33:48.660
See, we found a home

742
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:49.702
for all of the kids

743
00:33:49.702 --> 00:33:50.703
that we could.

744
00:33:50.703 --> 00:33:53.331
We're the leftovers.

745
00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:01.214
Santa, you take any one

746
00:34:01.214 --> 00:34:02.966
of those empty rooms, okay?

747
00:34:02.966 --> 00:34:04.008
I think it's time

748
00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:05.635
that I put the kids to bed.

749
00:34:05.635 --> 00:34:06.844
Good night.

750
00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:07.845
Good night.

751
00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:09.764
Thanks for dinner.

752
00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:15.103
For later.

753
00:34:17.313 --> 00:34:20.191
Good night, Santa.

754
00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:24.279
Come on, Elizabeth.

755
00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:26.447
Good night.

756
00:34:29.826 --> 00:34:32.036
Ahem.

757
00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:35.415
Santa! Hello!

758
00:34:35.415 --> 00:34:39.836
Santa! Big Red!

759
00:34:39.836 --> 00:34:41.087
Shall we?

760
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.892
Nice jammies.

761
00:34:58.813 --> 00:35:00.023
Uh, I'm sorry about

762
00:35:00.023 --> 00:35:01.065
the pajamas, Santa,

763
00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.692
but that's all we had.

764
00:35:02.692 --> 00:35:03.735
They're gonna patch up

765
00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:04.861
your Santa outfit,

766
00:35:04.861 --> 00:35:05.945
and we're gonna have them

767
00:35:05.945 --> 00:35:07.864
both ready by tomorrow.

768
00:35:07.864 --> 00:35:08.865
Good night.

769
00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:10.366
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

770
00:35:10.366 --> 00:35:13.077
You look great.

771
00:35:13.077 --> 00:35:14.495
You look like a leftover

772
00:35:14.495 --> 00:35:15.496
from last year's

773
00:35:15.496 --> 00:35:17.707
Christmas play.

774
00:35:17.707 --> 00:35:19.250
Eee! Look at you.

775
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.169
You look ridiculous.

776
00:35:21.169 --> 00:35:22.420
At least mine

777
00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.671
doesn't have a tail.

778
00:35:24.672 --> 00:35:25.673
Am I a sheep?

779
00:35:25.673 --> 00:35:26.674
Am I a bunny?

780
00:35:26.674 --> 00:35:29.928
Which one of these two things?

781
00:35:33.222 --> 00:35:35.224
Don't worry!

782
00:35:35.224 --> 00:35:36.768
You're Santa.

783
00:35:36.768 --> 00:35:38.019
Give it a rest, will ya?

784
00:35:38.019 --> 00:35:39.937
Thank you.

785
00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:44.108
Nighty-night.

786
00:35:47.487 --> 00:35:50.573
Good night, Santa.

787
00:35:59.666 --> 00:36:01.834
Just the way I like it.

788
00:36:01.834 --> 00:36:04.295
You know...

789
00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:05.630
Good morning, Santa!

790
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.966
I saved you a seat over..

791
00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:17.016
Santa! You forgot your, uh...

792
00:36:17.016 --> 00:36:19.477
Uh... Uh...

793
00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:21.479
You know, th-this is

794
00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:24.190
a-a very funny story.

795
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:25.984
Santa?

796
00:36:25.984 --> 00:36:28.403
Uh, Mrs. Claus says it

797
00:36:28.403 --> 00:36:30.321
tickles, so I just wear it

798
00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:34.158
for deliveries.

799
00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:35.535
Ha ha! There it is.

800
00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:38.996
Oh, hey, Santa, look.

801
00:36:38.996 --> 00:36:40.415
Read the front page.

802
00:36:42.792 --> 00:36:46.212
Yeah, you're quite a hero,

803
00:36:46.212 --> 00:36:48.965
Santa.

804
00:36:48.965 --> 00:36:50.675
You know, Santa, I can't help

805
00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:51.759
thinking I know you

806
00:36:51.759 --> 00:36:53.261
from somewhere.. I
-I mean,

807
00:36:53.261 --> 00:36:54.971
other than the mall.

808
00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:09.318
Delicious this way.

809
00:37:09.318 --> 00:37:11.571
Mm! Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

810
00:37:11.571 --> 00:37:13.156
Oh, you'll have to try it.

811
00:37:13.156 --> 00:37:15.324
Oh! That's the end of it.

812
00:37:15.324 --> 00:37:17.660
Sorry. Try the crunch berries.

813
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.081
They're even better. Fantastic.

814
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:24.250
Guess I'll just recycle this.

815
00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:33.217
Recycling, Kids.

816
00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:37.013
It's just the right thing to do.

817
00:37:37.013 --> 00:37:38.765
He's right.

818
00:37:44.312 --> 00:37:46.063
Welcome, Lenny, to the United

819
00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.064
Banking System's

820
00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:48.733
Print
-Secure Teller.

821
00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:50.568
For $100 gazillion,

822
00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:52.612
please place your stolen

823
00:37:52.612 --> 00:37:54.864
thumbprint on the scanner.

824
00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:17.094
Thank you for doing business

825
00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:18.638
with us, and have a nice life

826
00:38:18.638 --> 00:38:21.265
in South America.

827
00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:25.520
Let me give you a hand.

828
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.690
I... Always try and help people

829
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:31.109
out as much as I can.

830
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:32.819
Well, thank you.

831
00:38:32.819 --> 00:38:36.113
Hey, I'll wash, you dry.

832
00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:37.573
So, what are you

833
00:38:37.573 --> 00:38:39.617
gonna do now?

834
00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:40.993
Well, what do you think

835
00:38:40.993 --> 00:38:42.662
Santa would do?

836
00:38:42.662 --> 00:38:43.871
Well, I think Santa

837
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:45.081
would do nice things,

838
00:38:45.081 --> 00:38:46.290
like helping people,

839
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.292
spreading Christmas Spirit..

840
00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:49.460
You know, following

841
00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.462
all the Santa Rules.

842
00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:53.130
Santa Rules?

843
00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.258
Of course! You know!

844
00:38:55.258 --> 00:38:56.676
Oh, I get it.

845
00:38:56.676 --> 00:38:58.636
It's a test!

846
00:38:58.636 --> 00:38:59.846
Okay, it's like this.

847
00:38:59.846 --> 00:39:00.930
There's are things

848
00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:01.931
you always do,

849
00:39:01.931 --> 00:39:03.516
and things you never do.

850
00:39:03.516 --> 00:39:05.476
But it's just that some people

851
00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:06.811
only follow those rules

852
00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:08.104
around Christmastime.

853
00:39:08.104 --> 00:39:09.438
You always help someone

854
00:39:09.438 --> 00:39:11.023
less fortunate than you.

855
00:39:11.023 --> 00:39:12.358
You never turn your back

856
00:39:12.358 --> 00:39:13.609
on someone in need.

857
00:39:13.609 --> 00:39:15.486
When in doubt, help out.

858
00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.155
And act the way you do

859
00:39:17.155 --> 00:39:21.367
at Christmas all year round.

860
00:39:21.367 --> 00:39:22.660
Hmm. Santa Rules.

861
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.786
I like that.

862
00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:29.667
Bye, Santa.

863
00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:30.918
I fixed up your suit,

864
00:39:30.918 --> 00:39:31.961
Mr. Claus.

865
00:39:31.961 --> 00:39:33.212
It's pretty ripped up.

866
00:39:33.212 --> 00:39:34.922
I even made a few improvements.

867
00:39:34.922 --> 00:39:36.299
Improvements?

868
00:39:36.299 --> 00:39:38.217
Yeah. I gave it a more

869
00:39:38.217 --> 00:39:40.761
continental look.

870
00:39:40.761 --> 00:39:42.972
Wow!

871
00:39:42.972 --> 00:39:44.140
I shortened the sleeves

872
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.182
to freedom of movement,

873
00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.392
I gave it a V-neck,

874
00:39:46.392 --> 00:39:48.519
and a utility belt

875
00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:49.520
for Super Santa!

876
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.646
Wow!

877
00:39:50.646 --> 00:39:51.689
Do you like that?

878
00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:53.024
This is great, Sarah.

879
00:39:53.024 --> 00:39:54.025
Thanks.

880
00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:55.192
Where'd you learn to do this?

881
00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:57.695
Mega Man #96!

882
00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:59.572
Hoo hoo hoo!

883
00:39:59.572 --> 00:40:01.490
Cool duds, eh?

884
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.491
Wait a minute,

885
00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:04.160
where are my threads?

886
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.202
Keep your pants on, Q
-Tip.

887
00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:07.705
I'm getting there. Jeez.

888
00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:08.706
Excuse me.

889
00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:11.876
Psst.

890
00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:12.877
No problem.

891
00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:14.921
I'll get it.

892
00:40:20.134 --> 00:40:21.135
Good morning.

893
00:40:21.135 --> 00:40:23.012
I'm Helen Chu with News 8.

894
00:40:23.012 --> 00:40:24.555
We heard that the, uh,

895
00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:26.057
Santa with muscles lives here

896
00:40:26.057 --> 00:40:26.933
and we wanted to do

897
00:40:26.933 --> 00:40:27.850
a big feature on him.

898
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.851
Is he available?

899
00:40:28.851 --> 00:40:29.977
Uh, well, meet you

900
00:40:29.977 --> 00:40:31.312
in the courtyard in, uh,

901
00:40:31.312 --> 00:40:32.563
just a moment.

902
00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:33.898
By the way, how much do we

903
00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:35.233
get paid for this?

904
00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:37.902
Good morning, Lakeville.

905
00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.236
We've all heard the song

906
00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:41.030
"Santa Claus is coming to town."

907
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:42.239
Well, Santa isn't coming.

908
00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:43.240
He's already here

909
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.575
at the Lakeville Church

910
00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:45.910
of the Light Orphanage.

911
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.245
This Santa With Muscles

912
00:40:47.245 --> 00:40:48.579
not only foiled a robbery

913
00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:50.414
at the Lakeville Mall yesterday,

914
00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:51.999
but he also thwarted vandals

915
00:40:51.999 --> 00:40:53.251
here at the Mission.

916
00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:54.585
Santa Claus, may we have

917
00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:55.586
a word, please?

918
00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:56.921
We're live on Channel 8.

919
00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.547
Welcome to Lakeville, Santa.

920
00:40:58.547 --> 00:40:59.757
So, tell us..

921
00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:02.593
How did you get here?

922
00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:05.054
Uh...

923
00:41:05.054 --> 00:41:06.889
Uh...

924
00:41:06.889 --> 00:41:10.810
Um, well, uh...

925
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.980
Rooster.

926
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.191
Uh, sleigh?

927
00:41:20.903 --> 00:41:22.780
Reindeer!

928
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.448
The reindeer brought me here.

929
00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:25.783
Of course, but, Santa,

930
00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:27.368
you look so much more healthy

931
00:41:27.368 --> 00:41:28.619
than you did last year.

932
00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:30.454
Tell us what's your secret.

933
00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:32.206
Uh...

934
00:41:33.749 --> 00:41:36.460
I love... To eat a lot

935
00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.962
of reindeer meat.

936
00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:40.631
Doh!

937
00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:41.966
Just kidding, Helen.

938
00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:43.884
Um, I just.. I try to laugh

939
00:41:43.884 --> 00:41:45.469
a lot every day. Heh!

940
00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:47.263
Ho ho ho.

941
00:41:47.263 --> 00:41:49.473
There's a new Santa in town,

942
00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:50.808
and I know if you've been

943
00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:52.059
naughty or nice...

944
00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:55.021
So be nice!

945
00:41:55.021 --> 00:41:57.189
Uh, S
-Santa,

946
00:41:57.189 --> 00:41:58.274
thank you very much,

947
00:41:58.274 --> 00:41:59.275
but, uh, we.. We got

948
00:41:59.275 --> 00:42:00.276
a schedule to keep,

949
00:42:00.276 --> 00:42:01.277
and, gosh, you know

950
00:42:01.277 --> 00:42:02.278
how busy we are.

951
00:42:02.278 --> 00:42:03.279
Back to you, Helen.

952
00:42:03.279 --> 00:42:04.280
Ho ho ho!

953
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.823
I'm Helen Chu, reporting

954
00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:07.283
from Lakeville Orphanage.

955
00:42:07.283 --> 00:42:09.326
Now back to you in the studio.

956
00:42:09.326 --> 00:42:12.621
Yes, thank you, Santa,

957
00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:13.998
for putting the Orphanage

958
00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:16.250
on the map!

959
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.626
Let me ask you something,

960
00:42:17.626 --> 00:42:18.627
Dr. Blight.

961
00:42:18.627 --> 00:42:20.171
Does he remind you of anyone?

962
00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:21.630
Something about him

963
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:22.798
seems familiar.

964
00:42:22.798 --> 00:42:24.383
Of course. I saw him

965
00:42:24.383 --> 00:42:26.010
last year at this time.

966
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.386
And the year before that.

967
00:42:27.386 --> 00:42:28.471
You know what I'm

968
00:42:28.471 --> 00:42:29.472
talking about!

969
00:42:29.472 --> 00:42:30.473
Aah!

970
00:42:30.473 --> 00:42:31.974
I just can't put my finger

971
00:42:31.974 --> 00:42:35.144
on it yet, but I will.

972
00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:39.815
Yes!

973
00:42:39.815 --> 00:42:41.776
Ho ho ho ho ho! Ooh!

974
00:42:41.776 --> 00:42:43.527
Welcome, Mr. Thorne,

975
00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:45.196
to the United Banking System's

976
00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:46.864
Print
-Secure Teller.

977
00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:48.532
Place your thumb on the scanner

978
00:42:48.532 --> 00:42:50.701
for fingerprint identification.

979
00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.578
You betcha!

980
00:42:52.578 --> 00:42:56.999
Oh, Leonard, you are a genius!

981
00:42:58.167 --> 00:42:59.418
I'm sorry, that is

982
00:42:59.418 --> 00:43:01.045
your right thumb.

983
00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:02.546
Please place your left thumb

984
00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:04.548
on the scanner.

985
00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:10.346
Hey, will you give me a sec?

986
00:43:10.346 --> 00:43:11.430
How ya doin'?

987
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.057
Mr. Frost requests

988
00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:14.308
your presence.

989
00:43:14.308 --> 00:43:15.393
No problemo.

990
00:43:15.393 --> 00:43:16.727
I'll just, uh..

991
00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:19.855
Now, Lenny.

992
00:43:19.855 --> 00:43:21.565
Now's good.

993
00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:23.275
Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey!

994
00:43:23.275 --> 00:43:24.485
Easy with the jacket!

995
00:43:24.485 --> 00:43:25.945
Into the van, Elf Boy.

996
00:43:25.945 --> 00:43:27.905
Whoa!

997
00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:44.880
Ooh!

998
00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.923
What do you think

999
00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:46.924
you're doing?

1000
00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:47.925
Mr. Frost! Pleasure

1001
00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:48.926
to see you, Sir.

1002
00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:49.927
I was just working

1003
00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:50.970
on repaying that loan.

1004
00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.054
You're making trouble

1005
00:43:52.054 --> 00:43:53.097
for me, you little worm.

1006
00:43:53.097 --> 00:43:54.598
The last thing I need is anyone

1007
00:43:54.598 --> 00:43:55.766
drumming up support

1008
00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:56.892
for that Orphanage.

1009
00:43:56.892 --> 00:43:58.519
I want that Santa With Muscles

1010
00:43:58.519 --> 00:43:59.520
outta there.

1011
00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.480
Am I coming in clearly?!

1012
00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.606
We have a very good

1013
00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:03.607
connection, Sir.

1014
00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:04.775
I understand every word.

1015
00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:06.610
No more talk!

1016
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.779
In the North Pole.

1017
00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:10.573
I just want him gone.

1018
00:44:10.573 --> 00:44:12.616
Dump him.

1019
00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:16.036
Well, Mr. C., time for us

1020
00:44:16.036 --> 00:44:17.037
to push on.

1021
00:44:17.037 --> 00:44:18.789
What about your scooter?

1022
00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:20.457
Oh, it's, uh, better now.

1023
00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:22.126
Isn't that the darndest thing?

1024
00:44:22.126 --> 00:44:23.460
Besides, can't have you

1025
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.045
spending all your Christmas

1026
00:44:25.045 --> 00:44:26.130
Cheer in one place.

1027
00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.465
Have to spread it around,

1028
00:44:27.465 --> 00:44:28.465
you know?

1029
00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:29.550
Hop on. Good Santa.

1030
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:30.759
Attaboy.

1031
00:44:30.759 --> 00:44:32.303
I'm not leaving.

1032
00:44:32.303 --> 00:44:33.304
What?

1033
00:44:33.304 --> 00:44:35.639
They still need me here.

1034
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:39.852
I'm dead.

1035
00:44:40.853 --> 00:44:43.522

1036
00:44:43.522 --> 00:44:47.026

♪ Angel Baby ♪

1041
00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:03.792
I remember that song.

1042
00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:07.379
I know it's not the kind

1043
00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:08.505
of song I'm supposed

1044
00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:09.840
to sing here, but I think

1045
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.342
my mom sang it to me.

1046
00:45:11.342 --> 00:45:13.135
If I sing it just right,

1047
00:45:13.135 --> 00:45:14.720
I might be able to wake up

1048
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:16.889
the fairies in the window.

1049
00:45:16.889 --> 00:45:18.390
Fairies?

1050
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:19.767
Leslie says the church

1051
00:45:19.767 --> 00:45:21.560
has magic windows.

1052
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.853
People use to come

1053
00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:25.481
from all over to see them work.

1054
00:45:25.481 --> 00:45:30.194
Nobody comes anymore, though.

1055
00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:32.571
I used to think

1056
00:45:32.571 --> 00:45:33.948
that when they lit up,

1057
00:45:33.948 --> 00:45:36.242
it meant my mom was listening.

1058
00:45:36.242 --> 00:45:38.244
Does Santa have a mommy

1059
00:45:38.244 --> 00:45:39.495
and daddy?

1060
00:45:41.664 --> 00:45:43.415
I must, but...

1061
00:45:43.415 --> 00:45:45.584
I
-I don't remember.

1062
00:45:45.584 --> 00:45:47.419
I don't remember

1063
00:45:47.419 --> 00:45:51.006
my parents, either.

1064
00:45:51.006 --> 00:45:53.175
Itchy?

1065
00:45:53.175 --> 00:45:54.760
Why not take it off?

1066
00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.429
You don't mind?

1067
00:45:57.429 --> 00:45:58.764
Even if you don't have

1068
00:45:58.764 --> 00:45:59.932
a beard, you'd still

1069
00:45:59.932 --> 00:46:01.392
be Santa, right?

1070
00:46:06.563 --> 00:46:08.357
Let's try that song again.

1071
00:46:08.357 --> 00:46:09.733
Do you know it?

1072
00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:11.610
Start me off.

1073
00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:13.821
♪ I'll always remember

1074
00:46:13.821 --> 00:46:16.699
♪ The time I spent with you

1075
00:46:16.699 --> 00:46:19.326

00:46:19.326 --> 00:46:21.579

00:46:27.293 --> 00:46:30.087

♪ All time ♪

1082
00:46:36.135 --> 00:46:37.761
Wow!

1083
00:46:49.648 --> 00:46:51.233
Oh, look.

1084
00:46:51.233 --> 00:46:53.110
Ho ho ho!

1085
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.987
Ha ha!

1086
00:46:54.987 --> 00:46:56.322
Hey, Santa, could you

1087
00:46:56.322 --> 00:46:58.073
give me a hand here?

1088
00:46:59.074 --> 00:47:01.160
Ho ho ho. Very funny.

1089
00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.161
I gotcha.

1090
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:03.162
Very funny.

1091
00:47:03.162 --> 00:47:04.330
Come help us!

1092
00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:05.581
No, we're not

1093
00:47:05.581 --> 00:47:06.582
gonna stop...

1094
00:47:06.582 --> 00:47:09.918
I'm proud of you, Son.

1095
00:47:09.918 --> 00:47:11.754
You finally made something

1096
00:47:11.754 --> 00:47:14.590
of yourself, after all.

1097
00:47:20.179 --> 00:47:21.180
Hey!

1098
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.222
What happened?

1099
00:47:22.222 --> 00:47:23.599
Where did it come from?

1100
00:47:23.599 --> 00:47:26.477
It's our statue head.

1101
00:47:30.606 --> 00:47:32.107
Oh, I bet you it was...

1102
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:35.778
No! Come on..

1103
00:47:35.778 --> 00:47:38.030
Please don't.

1104
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:39.031
They're not after you.

1105
00:47:39.031 --> 00:47:40.324
Never turn your back

1106
00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.367
on someone in need.

1107
00:47:41.367 --> 00:47:42.534
A friend of mine once

1108
00:47:42.534 --> 00:47:45.204
told me that.

1109
00:47:45.204 --> 00:47:46.622
Keep the milk

1110
00:47:46.622 --> 00:47:49.083
and cookies warm.

1111
00:47:51.377 --> 00:47:53.003
Sarah, come on.

1112
00:48:00.719 --> 00:48:02.346
I thought it was Christmas,

1113
00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:03.389
not Halloween.

1114
00:48:03.389 --> 00:48:05.307
Why don't you go Trick
-Or
-Treat

1115
00:48:05.307 --> 00:48:07.851
somewhere else, Doctor?

1116
00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:09.937
Certainly, Santa.

1117
00:48:09.937 --> 00:48:11.855
After you.

1118
00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:13.107
Shouldn't you

1119
00:48:13.107 --> 00:48:14.441
be back in the North Pole

1120
00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:16.026
around now?

1121
00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.528
I strongly suggest that you

1122
00:48:17.528 --> 00:48:20.906
return to your next of kin.

1123
00:48:20.906 --> 00:48:22.866
This is my family.

1124
00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:25.327
Very well.

1125
00:48:25.327 --> 00:48:27.079
Oh, what the heck.

1126
00:48:27.079 --> 00:48:29.915
I'll wing it.

1127
00:48:29.915 --> 00:48:33.210
Patient: Santa Claus.

1128
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.672
Complaint: Mm...

1129
00:48:36.672 --> 00:48:39.716
Blurry vision.

1130
00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:41.218
Reflexes...

1131
00:48:44.263 --> 00:48:45.431
Jeez!

1132
00:48:46.432 --> 00:48:48.100
Beautiful thing.

1133
00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.894
Do you have the keys?

1134
00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:52.271
Patient suffers

1135
00:48:52.271 --> 00:48:53.522
from bad tummy aches...

1136
00:48:53.522 --> 00:48:54.523
Ooh!

1137
00:48:54.523 --> 00:48:58.444
And splitting headaches.

1138
00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:04.575
Take one of these

1139
00:49:04.575 --> 00:49:05.826
in the morning.

1140
00:49:07.494 --> 00:49:10.038
And get plenty of bed rest.

1141
00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:14.209
Whoo! Yes!

1142
00:49:15.878 --> 00:49:18.589
Santa!

1143
00:49:20.799 --> 00:49:22.468
Whoo-hoo!

1144
00:49:24.928 --> 00:49:26.388
Way to go! Way to go!

1145
00:49:29.892 --> 00:49:31.393
You know, I was gonna help

1146
00:49:31.393 --> 00:49:32.519
You but the, uh, door

1147
00:49:32.519 --> 00:49:33.520
kind of stuck.

1148
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.855
Wow, the way you give him

1149
00:49:34.855 --> 00:49:36.231
that.. Ba-bing! Ba-bing!

1150
00:49:36.231 --> 00:49:37.691
Come on. Come on.

1151
00:49:37.691 --> 00:49:39.401
You know, maybe the man

1152
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:40.486
is right.

1153
00:49:40.486 --> 00:49:42.196
Maybe it's time you,

1154
00:49:42.196 --> 00:49:44.114
uh, did head back home.

1155
00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:46.950
Yeah. Tomorrow's Christmas.

1156
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.285
Don't you have to go back

1157
00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:49.787
to the North Pole?

1158
00:49:49.787 --> 00:49:52.456
I'm not going anywhere.

1159
00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:53.790
I'm not gonna let anyone

1160
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:56.251
steal our Christmas.

1161
00:49:56.251 --> 00:50:00.339
Hey, Guys, where's Taylor?

1162
00:50:00.339 --> 00:50:02.132
Oh, yeah.

1163
00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.300
Huh?

1164
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.301
Uh, yeah...

1165
00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:05.803
Taylor!

1166
00:50:05.803 --> 00:50:07.179
Come on out of there

1167
00:50:07.179 --> 00:50:08.180
wherever you are.

1168
00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.181
Taylor!

1169
00:50:09.181 --> 00:50:10.641
Taylor!

1170
00:50:10.641 --> 00:50:12.267
Taylor!

1171
00:50:12.267 --> 00:50:13.852
Taylor, this isn't funny.

1172
00:50:13.852 --> 00:50:15.562
We're not kidding.

1173
00:50:15.562 --> 00:50:17.356
I think I know where he is.

1174
00:50:55.561 --> 00:50:57.187
Well, Mr. C.

1175
00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.689
How we supposed to get

1176
00:50:58.689 --> 00:51:00.649
over this, fly on one

1177
00:51:00.649 --> 00:51:03.860
of your reindeer, hmm?

1178
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.696
Aah!

1179
00:51:06.989 --> 00:51:08.240
Was that necessary?

1180
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.241
Okay, okay.

1181
00:51:09.241 --> 00:51:12.202
Shut up. Let's go.

1182
00:51:14.955 --> 00:51:16.248
Aw, boy. I hope you

1183
00:51:16.248 --> 00:51:17.833
appreciate the risk

1184
00:51:17.833 --> 00:51:19.334
I'm taking here.

1185
00:51:19.334 --> 00:51:21.044
Just remember, when Christmas

1186
00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.421
Day rolls around, I expect

1187
00:51:22.421 --> 00:51:23.922
a little something extra..

1188
00:51:28.427 --> 00:51:29.511
You didn't square

1189
00:51:29.511 --> 00:51:30.512
the denominator!

1190
00:51:38.729 --> 00:51:40.188
If you quantify that data,

1191
00:51:40.188 --> 00:51:41.189
you'll see..

1192
00:51:41.189 --> 00:51:42.190
You're wrong.

1193
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:43.191
It'll never work.

1194
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:44.192
But I found

1195
00:51:44.192 --> 00:51:45.736
the formula for pain!

1196
00:51:47.946 --> 00:51:49.448
What are you trying to do,

1197
00:51:49.448 --> 00:51:50.449
smother me?

1198
00:51:50.449 --> 00:51:51.658
I have a very delicate

1199
00:51:51.658 --> 00:51:53.285
metabolism, you know!

1200
00:51:53.285 --> 00:51:55.287
Okay.

1201
00:51:55.287 --> 00:51:56.538
Sir, you could leave

1202
00:51:56.538 --> 00:51:58.165
the mansion from time to time.

1203
00:51:58.165 --> 00:52:00.834
It'd made things a lot easier.

1204
00:52:07.674 --> 00:52:09.176
Germs have been hovering

1205
00:52:09.176 --> 00:52:11.219
around me my whole life!

1206
00:52:11.219 --> 00:52:12.220
No, no, no!

1207
00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:15.682
I don't want to...

1208
00:52:20.896 --> 00:52:22.898
This is naughty.

1209
00:52:24.524 --> 00:52:26.568
But he's even worse.

1210
00:52:26.568 --> 00:52:30.656
That doesn't make it right.

1211
00:52:30.656 --> 00:52:33.033
I was only trying to be

1212
00:52:33.033 --> 00:52:36.495
like you, protecting all of us.

1213
00:52:38.163 --> 00:52:39.247
I did what I had to

1214
00:52:39.247 --> 00:52:40.874
in self-defense, Taylor.

1215
00:52:40.874 --> 00:52:41.875
I'm only tough

1216
00:52:41.875 --> 00:52:43.251
when I have to be.

1217
00:52:43.251 --> 00:52:46.797
Is that a Santa Rule?

1218
00:52:49.341 --> 00:52:52.219
It's my rule. Come on.

1219
00:52:53.345 --> 00:52:55.305
Look. Something's going on.

1220
00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:56.348
Not by video.

1221
00:52:56.348 --> 00:52:57.474
I'm going to be involved

1222
00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:58.475
this time.

1223
00:52:58.475 --> 00:52:59.518
We're here already,

1224
00:52:59.518 --> 00:53:01.186
so let's at least check it out.

1225
00:53:01.186 --> 00:53:03.021
Lenny, go with Taylor

1226
00:53:03.021 --> 00:53:04.439
back to the bikes.

1227
00:53:04.439 --> 00:53:05.857
I'll take a look.

1228
00:53:05.857 --> 00:53:07.359
Aw, come on.

1229
00:53:07.359 --> 00:53:08.652
That's the most sense

1230
00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.362
I heard anybody make all night.

1231
00:53:10.362 --> 00:53:12.030
Come on, Kid.

1232
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.323
Did I ever tell you about

1233
00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:14.741
the time Santa and I fought

1234
00:53:14.741 --> 00:53:16.201
those two guys at the mall?

1235
00:53:16.201 --> 00:53:17.202
Forget about it,

1236
00:53:17.202 --> 00:53:18.954
my little friend.

1237
00:53:18.954 --> 00:53:19.955
Stop!

1238
00:53:19.955 --> 00:53:21.081
I'm trying to take

1239
00:53:21.081 --> 00:53:22.290
your blood pressure.

1240
00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:24.042
Well, then, take it!

1241
00:53:24.042 --> 00:53:25.168
A little thing

1242
00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.169
we call a phobia.

1243
00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:28.213
Oh, you presume...

1244
00:53:28.213 --> 00:53:29.506
That's in your head!

1245
00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:31.049
It's in your head, Sir.

1246
00:53:31.049 --> 00:53:33.343
Are you listening to me?

1247
00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:34.970
Now that I own

1248
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:36.054
all of Lakeville,

1249
00:53:36.054 --> 00:53:37.472
I can begin excavation

1250
00:53:37.472 --> 00:53:39.683
immediately.

1251
00:53:41.059 --> 00:53:42.060
I've been waiting

1252
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.729
a long time for this.

1253
00:53:43.729 --> 00:53:45.272
I want what is due me,

1254
00:53:45.272 --> 00:53:46.815
and I want it now.

1255
00:53:46.815 --> 00:53:48.567
Yes, but, Sir,

1256
00:53:48.567 --> 00:53:49.818
aren't you forgetting

1257
00:53:49.818 --> 00:53:51.069
one minor detail?

1258
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:53.071
I want that Orphanage cleared

1259
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:54.865
before the last Christmas

1260
00:53:54.865 --> 00:53:56.241
Turkey is sliced.

1261
00:53:56.241 --> 00:53:59.327
Do you understand me, Doctor?

1262
00:54:00.328 --> 00:54:03.665
Sir, your blood pressure.

1263
00:54:10.672 --> 00:54:12.090
So, what's under

1264
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:13.091
the Orphanage?

1265
00:54:13.091 --> 00:54:14.760
Water and power lines.

1266
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.428
Telephone cables.

1267
00:54:16.428 --> 00:54:17.763
Sewer.

1268
00:54:17.763 --> 00:54:21.433
Rats. Big, ugly rats.

1269
00:54:21.433 --> 00:54:22.684
The clubhouse.

1270
00:54:22.684 --> 00:54:24.770
Clubhouse?

1271
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:25.854
Oh, the old catacombs

1272
00:54:25.854 --> 00:54:26.938
underneath the church.

1273
00:54:26.938 --> 00:54:27.939
Yeah, the kids use it

1274
00:54:27.939 --> 00:54:28.940
as a clubhouse.

1275
00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:30.275
And there's a big vault

1276
00:54:30.275 --> 00:54:31.276
door down there.

1277
00:54:31.276 --> 00:54:32.444
A vault.

1278
00:54:32.444 --> 00:54:34.112
Now, Kids, we're gonna find out

1279
00:54:34.112 --> 00:54:36.406
what Frost wants.

1280
00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:38.033
Clayton, what's in that vault

1281
00:54:38.033 --> 00:54:39.034
down there?

1282
00:54:39.034 --> 00:54:40.327
I don't know. I don't think

1283
00:54:40.327 --> 00:54:41.953
it's been open in all the years

1284
00:54:41.953 --> 00:54:42.954
I've been here.

1285
00:54:42.954 --> 00:54:44.456
We know the combination.

1286
00:54:44.456 --> 00:54:46.374
Well, some of it.

1287
00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:51.129
Yeah, it's gross and creepy,

1288
00:54:51.129 --> 00:54:52.130
just like now.

1289
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:54.174
Oh, shut up.

1290
00:54:54.174 --> 00:54:56.176
Here we go.

1291
00:54:59.805 --> 00:55:00.972
Be careful.

1292
00:55:00.972 --> 00:55:02.641
Watch your step.

1293
00:55:04.142 --> 00:55:05.435
It's very dark.

1294
00:55:05.435 --> 00:55:06.436
Kids, don't get

1295
00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:07.437
too far ahead.

1296
00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:08.814
Scary.

1297
00:55:10.649 --> 00:55:12.734
Look at those spider webs!

1298
00:55:45.225 --> 00:55:46.560
So, how far did you get

1299
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.853
with the combination.

1300
00:55:47.853 --> 00:55:48.854
Not that far.

1301
00:55:48.854 --> 00:55:49.855
Three numbers.

1302
00:55:49.855 --> 00:55:51.898
I'll show you.

1303
00:55:53.441 --> 00:55:54.693
This one's eight.

1304
00:55:54.693 --> 00:55:57.487
The second number is...

1305
00:55:57.487 --> 00:56:01.616
24. Next.

1306
00:56:01.616 --> 00:56:04.536
And the third one is...

1307
00:56:07.622 --> 00:56:09.708
16.

1308
00:56:09.708 --> 00:56:13.044
That's as far as we've gotten.

1309
00:56:13.044 --> 00:56:15.130
Eight, 24, 16.

1310
00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:16.548
That's right.

1311
00:56:18.216 --> 00:56:19.467
What is he doing?

1312
00:56:23.722 --> 00:56:25.307
h, my god!

1313
00:56:25.307 --> 00:56:27.893
Whoa whoa whoa!

1314
00:56:29.895 --> 00:56:31.563
Oh, my god!

1315
00:56:42.824 --> 00:56:45.118
Looks okay. I'll lead.

1316
00:56:46.995 --> 00:56:49.372
Slow down.

1317
00:56:53.251 --> 00:56:55.921
It's beautiful.

1318
00:57:04.596 --> 00:57:06.932
Wow.

1319
00:57:06.932 --> 00:57:07.933
Clayton...

1320
00:57:07.933 --> 00:57:09.100
It's everywhere!

1321
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.727
This has been underneath us

1322
00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:11.937
the whole time.

1323
00:57:11.937 --> 00:57:13.772
These are what must make

1324
00:57:13.772 --> 00:57:15.523
the church windows glow.

1325
00:57:15.523 --> 00:57:18.944
These are the fairies?

1326
00:57:18.944 --> 00:57:20.612
Unbelievable.

1327
00:57:28.119 --> 00:57:29.537
It's warm.

1328
00:57:29.537 --> 00:57:31.039
Oh, put that down, Honey.

1329
00:57:31.039 --> 00:57:32.374
You don't know where it's been.

1330
00:57:32.374 --> 00:57:34.751
Mom!

1331
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:38.713
Mom! Mom!

1332
00:57:38.713 --> 00:57:39.798
Hey, Guys, I know

1333
00:57:39.798 --> 00:57:41.549
what these are.

1334
00:57:41.549 --> 00:57:42.926
These are Piezoelectric

1335
00:57:42.926 --> 00:57:44.469
Crystals.. I read about them

1336
00:57:44.469 --> 00:57:45.470
in my geology book.

1337
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:46.680
They're Quartz Crystals

1338
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.889
with natural electricity

1339
00:57:47.889 --> 00:57:49.307
in them. Vibrations make them

1340
00:57:49.307 --> 00:57:50.308
put out power.

1341
00:57:50.308 --> 00:57:52.102
They must be worth millions!

1342
00:57:52.102 --> 00:57:53.103
Electricity?

1343
00:57:53.103 --> 00:57:55.814
Taylor, put that down.

1344
00:57:55.814 --> 00:57:57.899
Okay.

1345
00:57:57.899 --> 00:57:59.150
Oh!

1346
00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:00.652
Told you so.

1347
00:58:00.652 --> 00:58:01.653
Everybody out,

1348
00:58:01.653 --> 00:58:03.655
and watch your feet!

1349
00:58:03.655 --> 00:58:04.864
You don't want to step

1350
00:58:04.864 --> 00:58:05.865
on one of those.

1351
00:58:05.865 --> 00:58:08.034
Watch your feet!

1352
00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.416
You coming?

1353
00:58:16.167 --> 00:58:18.336
In a minute.

1354
00:58:18.336 --> 00:58:19.713
I just want to figure out

1355
00:58:19.713 --> 00:58:21.298
how I opened the vault.

1356
00:58:21.298 --> 00:58:24.801
Hey...

1357
00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:27.804
You're Santa Claus.

1358
00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:29.305
Come on, let's go.

1359
00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:31.433
Then Dr. Blight was right.

1360
00:58:31.433 --> 00:58:33.351
Why am I not at the North Pole,

1361
00:58:33.351 --> 00:58:34.853
then, and how to all the kids

1362
00:58:34.853 --> 00:58:35.854
in the world get

1363
00:58:35.854 --> 00:58:37.856
their presents tomorrow?

1364
00:58:37.856 --> 00:58:39.190
I don't think you want

1365
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:40.316
to ask too many questions.

1366
00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:42.360
It only makes trouble.

1367
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.071
You're not... Buying

1368
00:58:45.071 --> 00:58:47.741
the Santa thing, are you?

1369
00:58:47.741 --> 00:58:51.244
All right, you want the truth?

1370
00:58:51.244 --> 00:58:54.205
The truth is...

1371
00:58:58.126 --> 00:59:01.254
You see this?

1372
00:59:01.254 --> 00:59:02.464
You were wearing this

1373
00:59:02.464 --> 00:59:03.465
when I found you.

1374
00:59:03.465 --> 00:59:05.383
How'd you get blood on you?

1375
00:59:05.383 --> 00:59:06.801
I don't know.

1376
00:59:06.801 --> 00:59:07.802
I don't ask.

1377
00:59:07.802 --> 00:59:09.554
You ask too many questions,

1378
00:59:09.554 --> 00:59:11.139
maybe you find out you're

1379
00:59:11.139 --> 00:59:15.310
a wanted criminal or something.

1380
00:59:17.896 --> 00:59:18.980
Look, I don't have

1381
00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:21.191
all the answers,

1382
00:59:21.191 --> 00:59:23.026
but those kids,

1383
00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:24.569
they need Santa Claus

1384
00:59:24.569 --> 00:59:26.863
right now.

1385
00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:29.824
Just be Santa.

1386
00:59:29.824 --> 00:59:31.201
We'll figure out the rest

1387
00:59:31.201 --> 00:59:34.079
later, all right?

1388
00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:35.747
Thanks.

1389
00:59:35.747 --> 00:59:36.748
Hey, that's

1390
00:59:36.748 --> 00:59:38.041
what I'm here for.

1391
00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:39.042
Just give me

1392
00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:40.585
a couple more minutes.

1393
00:59:40.585 --> 00:59:42.796
They're all yours.

1394
00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:50.678
See you upstairs?

1395
00:59:50.678 --> 00:59:53.098
Thank you.

1396
00:59:53.098 --> 00:59:55.225
You got it.

1397
01:00:03.358 --> 01:00:05.068
Yo, this is Lenny.

1398
01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:06.945
Hello, Lenny.

1399
01:00:06.945 --> 01:00:08.988
I'll pay you the money

1400
01:00:08.988 --> 01:00:10.115
somehow, Mr. Frost,

1401
01:00:10.115 --> 01:00:11.116
but please, I don't

1402
01:00:11.116 --> 01:00:12.117
think it's right.

1403
01:00:12.117 --> 01:00:14.035
I just.. I just can't.

1404
01:00:14.035 --> 01:00:15.537
When I want your opinion,

1405
01:00:15.537 --> 01:00:17.413
I'll have it surgically removed.

1406
01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:19.040
Mr. Frost, they're keeping

1407
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.459
pretty close tabs on me.

1408
01:00:21.459 --> 01:00:22.544
Then you'll have

1409
01:00:22.544 --> 01:00:23.545
to be sneaky.

1410
01:00:23.545 --> 01:00:24.921
You're very good at that,

1411
01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:25.922
so listen to me,

1412
01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:27.298
you pollutant.

1413
01:00:27.298 --> 01:00:28.591
Okay.

1414
01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:35.515
Hey! The lights are out.

1415
01:00:37.142 --> 01:00:39.269
Aah!

1416
01:00:40.562 --> 01:00:42.730
What is it? What happened?

1417
01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:44.065
He's.. He's in there,

1418
01:00:44.065 --> 01:00:46.484
and he's... Oh!

1419
01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.320
I believe she's trying

1420
01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.573
to say it's me.

1421
01:00:51.573 --> 01:00:53.658
What are you looking at?

1422
01:00:53.658 --> 01:00:55.034
Nothing.

1423
01:00:55.034 --> 01:00:56.870
Think you're

1424
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:59.581
funny, don't you?

1425
01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:01.791
You!

1426
01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.751
Where did you..

1427
01:01:03.751 --> 01:01:06.838
But I thought that..

1428
01:01:06.838 --> 01:01:08.006
You guys okay?

1429
01:01:08.006 --> 01:01:09.424
Yeah!

1430
01:01:26.024 --> 01:01:27.025
You know, I have

1431
01:01:27.025 --> 01:01:28.860
a Christmas Wish, Santa.

1432
01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.029
Get out of my life!

1433
01:01:44.709 --> 01:01:46.878
Damn!

1434
01:01:51.716 --> 01:01:52.759
Ho ho ho.

1435
01:02:02.227 --> 01:02:04.312
Afraid of heights, Santa?

1436
01:02:04.312 --> 01:02:05.897
I can cure that.

1437
01:02:08.566 --> 01:02:10.318
Cure this!

1438
01:02:27.502 --> 01:02:29.963
Santa, you slay me.

1439
01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:44.435
Ho ho ho.

1440
01:02:44.435 --> 01:02:45.436
Ho ho ho.

1441
01:02:45.436 --> 01:02:46.604
Ho ho ho.

1442
01:02:46.604 --> 01:02:51.818
Oh oh ohhhh!

1443
01:02:56.447 --> 01:02:57.448
All right!

1444
01:02:57.448 --> 01:03:00.410
There, I got my Christmas Wish!

1445
01:03:09.794 --> 01:03:11.963
Oh! The picture's

1446
01:03:11.963 --> 01:03:14.966
still not big enough.

1447
01:03:41.159 --> 01:03:43.328
Oh, man.

1448
01:03:43.328 --> 01:03:46.080
What a dream.

1449
01:03:50.668 --> 01:03:52.628
Santa Claus...

1450
01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:55.340
What a bonehead.

1451
01:04:05.266 --> 01:04:07.602
Happy Christmas, Mr. Thorne.

1452
01:04:09.687 --> 01:04:13.191
Did we have a good sleep?

1453
01:04:13.191 --> 01:04:14.817
What happened?

1454
01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:16.152
I was hoping you could

1455
01:04:16.152 --> 01:04:17.653
Tell me, Sir.

1456
01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.155
A gentleman...

1457
01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:21.783
Waste disposal engineer,

1458
01:04:21.783 --> 01:04:23.743
in fact, he caught sight

1459
01:04:23.743 --> 01:04:25.370
of you in his dumpster

1460
01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:26.621
and, recognizing you

1461
01:04:26.621 --> 01:04:28.206
from your products,

1462
01:04:28.206 --> 01:04:30.375
he fetched you back here...

1463
01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:32.710
Wearing that.

1464
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:36.297
I was... Santa Claus.

1465
01:04:38.383 --> 01:04:40.677
Leslie! The kids!

1466
01:04:40.677 --> 01:04:42.387
Oh...

1467
01:04:43.971 --> 01:04:45.723
Operator, connect me

1468
01:04:45.723 --> 01:04:47.350
with the Lakeville Orphanage.

1469
01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:49.394
Hello?

1470
01:04:49.394 --> 01:04:53.398
Leslie, it's me, uh, Santa.

1471
01:04:53.398 --> 01:04:55.233
What do you want?

1472
01:04:55.233 --> 01:04:56.901
Huh?

1473
01:04:56.901 --> 01:04:57.902
What do you mean?

1474
01:04:57.902 --> 01:04:59.821
Are you and the kids okay?

1475
01:04:59.821 --> 01:05:01.531
I remember Dr. Blight

1476
01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:02.865
was there and Elizabeth

1477
01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.534
screamed, and..

1478
01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:05.535
And I think I fell

1479
01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:06.536
off the roof.

1480
01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:07.578
I'm sorry I left you

1481
01:05:07.578 --> 01:05:08.579
and the kids.

1482
01:05:08.579 --> 01:05:09.914
You're so full of it.

1483
01:05:09.914 --> 01:05:11.499
Just leave us alone.

1484
01:05:11.499 --> 01:05:12.917
Why don't you just

1485
01:05:12.917 --> 01:05:15.461
disappear forever?

1486
01:05:26.347 --> 01:05:27.348
That takes care

1487
01:05:27.348 --> 01:05:28.850
of Santa the clown.

1488
01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:30.101
Assemble the team.

1489
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:33.604
We're taking the Orphanage now.

1490
01:05:44.115 --> 01:05:45.658
And the question everyone

1491
01:05:45.658 --> 01:05:47.660
is asking is "Where's Santa?"

1492
01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:48.953
Lakeville's own Santa

1493
01:05:48.953 --> 01:05:50.079
With Muscles has not

1494
01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.372
been spotted since he

1495
01:05:51.372 --> 01:05:52.790
foiled a purse-snatching

1496
01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:53.791
yesterday.

1497
01:05:53.791 --> 01:05:55.376
It's been wildly speculated

1498
01:05:55.376 --> 01:05:56.461
that he's returned

1499
01:05:56.461 --> 01:05:57.462
to the North Pole.

1500
01:05:57.462 --> 01:05:58.796
Back to you in the studio

1501
01:05:58.796 --> 01:06:01.424
and Merry Christmas.

1502
01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:07.555
I'm not surprised.

1503
01:06:07.555 --> 01:06:08.764
There's no such thing

1504
01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:10.933
as Santa.

1505
01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:32.246
Hey, little one.

1506
01:06:32.246 --> 01:06:33.456
Maybe he did go back

1507
01:06:33.456 --> 01:06:35.666
to the North Pole.

1508
01:06:35.666 --> 01:06:37.835
Hello, Twinkle Toes.

1509
01:06:37.835 --> 01:06:38.961
I could use some help

1510
01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:41.005
in the kitchen.

1511
01:06:57.522 --> 01:06:59.524
Who is that?

1512
01:06:59.524 --> 01:07:00.525
It's okay!

1513
01:07:00.525 --> 01:07:02.193
I don't know!

1514
01:07:02.193 --> 01:07:04.946
Oh, no!

1515
01:07:04.946 --> 01:07:06.697
Aah! Aah!

1516
01:07:10.535 --> 01:07:12.828
It's all right, I'm here.

1517
01:07:22.463 --> 01:07:23.798
Wait till Santa hears

1518
01:07:23.798 --> 01:07:24.799
about this!

1519
01:07:24.799 --> 01:07:26.801
He'll kick your butt

1520
01:07:26.801 --> 01:07:28.636
to New Year's!

1521
01:07:28.636 --> 01:07:29.637
Oh!

1522
01:07:29.637 --> 01:07:30.721
Yeah!

1523
01:07:30.721 --> 01:07:34.141
The field is sterilized, Sir.

1524
01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:43.317
Merry Christmas to all.

1525
01:07:43.317 --> 01:07:46.821
Gentlemen, bring the children.

1526
01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:05.423
What do you want with us?

1527
01:08:05.423 --> 01:08:07.925
With you, nothing.

1528
01:08:07.925 --> 01:08:09.927
I want what's in your vault,

1529
01:08:09.927 --> 01:08:10.928
What's under this

1530
01:08:10.928 --> 01:08:12.680
whole neighborhood.

1531
01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:13.681
You just happen

1532
01:08:13.681 --> 01:08:14.599
to be in the way.

1533
01:08:14.599 --> 01:08:16.017
Then let us go.

1534
01:08:16.017 --> 01:08:17.101
Who's going to do

1535
01:08:17.101 --> 01:08:20.771
my mining?

1536
01:08:20.771 --> 01:08:23.566
Why, you son of a!!!

1537
01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:24.942
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1538
01:08:24.942 --> 01:08:27.945
There are children present.

1539
01:08:27.945 --> 01:08:30.072
Children...

1540
01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:32.742
Hello, Children.

1541
01:08:33.951 --> 01:08:35.244
I'd like you to do a favor

1542
01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:37.038
for your Uncle Ebner.

1543
01:08:37.038 --> 01:08:40.207
I'd like you to open that vault.

1544
01:08:40.207 --> 01:08:41.208
We can't.

1545
01:08:41.208 --> 01:08:42.543
We don't know anything.

1546
01:08:42.543 --> 01:08:44.128
We're just kids.

1547
01:08:44.128 --> 01:08:45.046
You help out

1548
01:08:45.046 --> 01:08:45.921
your Uncle Ebner,

1549
01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:46.923
and I'll give you

1550
01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:48.299
some Christmas cookies,

1551
01:08:48.299 --> 01:08:51.135
candy canes, and plum pudding.

1552
01:08:51.135 --> 01:08:52.136
Yuck.

1553
01:08:52.136 --> 01:08:54.096
Plum pudding?

1554
01:08:56.682 --> 01:08:57.683
I tried.

1555
01:08:57.683 --> 01:08:59.977
Prepare them for mining!

1556
01:08:59.977 --> 01:09:01.729
No!

1557
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:02.730
Lenny!

1558
01:09:02.730 --> 01:09:04.315
Oh, by the way, Lenny,

1559
01:09:04.315 --> 01:09:05.316
I want to thank you

1560
01:09:05.316 --> 01:09:06.484
for letting us in.

1561
01:09:06.484 --> 01:09:07.610
I'm sure it was quite

1562
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:08.736
a sacrifice for you.

1563
01:09:08.736 --> 01:09:09.820
Lenny? I thought

1564
01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.405
you were a real elf!

1565
01:09:11.405 --> 01:09:12.573
Take them away!

1566
01:09:12.573 --> 01:09:14.825
Oh, my god.

1567
01:09:16.494 --> 01:09:17.662
Benedict Arnold.

1568
01:09:17.662 --> 01:09:18.663
I
-I..

1569
01:09:18.663 --> 01:09:20.915
Can't believe you, traitor!

1570
01:09:23.167 --> 01:09:25.836
You can open it, can't you?

1571
01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.632
Oh, yeah.

1572
01:09:31.717 --> 01:09:33.719
Oh, yeah!

1573
01:09:44.855 --> 01:09:46.607
Aah!

1574
01:09:49.985 --> 01:09:52.697
Aah!

1575
01:09:54.407 --> 01:09:57.159
Thanks, Pierre.

1576
01:10:02.957 --> 01:10:05.000
Mon Dieu, I never seen

1577
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.794
the boss like this.

1578
01:10:06.794 --> 01:10:09.880
He loves to hit me.

1579
01:10:16.595 --> 01:10:18.222
Yeah.

1580
01:10:18.222 --> 01:10:19.724
Santa, it's Lenny.

1581
01:10:19.724 --> 01:10:21.934
Lenny! How are you?

1582
01:10:21.934 --> 01:10:23.144
I tried to call, but..

1583
01:10:23.144 --> 01:10:24.311
Forget it, Big Guy.

1584
01:10:24.311 --> 01:10:25.354
There's no time.

1585
01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:26.397
Mr. Frost is trying

1586
01:10:26.397 --> 01:10:27.732
to take over the Orphanage

1587
01:10:27.732 --> 01:10:28.816
with his goon squad.

1588
01:10:28.816 --> 01:10:30.317
He's got his pet scientists

1589
01:10:30.317 --> 01:10:31.318
everywhere.

1590
01:10:31.318 --> 01:10:32.862
He's trying to get in the vault,

1591
01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:33.863
and when he does,

1592
01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:35.114
he's gonna use the kids

1593
01:10:35.114 --> 01:10:36.407
to mine the crystals.

1594
01:10:36.407 --> 01:10:37.533
I don't know how long

1595
01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:39.118
it's gonna be before..

1596
01:10:39.118 --> 01:10:40.745
Ow ow ow.

1597
01:10:41.912 --> 01:10:45.374
How's my favorite patient?

1598
01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.251
Remind me to prescribe

1599
01:10:47.251 --> 01:10:48.294
something for that

1600
01:10:48.294 --> 01:10:50.254
pounding headache you must have

1601
01:10:50.254 --> 01:10:52.506
after that nasty fall!

1602
01:10:52.506 --> 01:10:54.091
Remind me to introduce you

1603
01:10:54.091 --> 01:10:55.426
to my two little friends,

1604
01:10:55.426 --> 01:10:57.094
lefty and righty.

1605
01:10:57.094 --> 01:11:00.931
Oh, save it, Santa.

1606
01:11:00.931 --> 01:11:02.767
These long-distance phone calls

1607
01:11:02.767 --> 01:11:04.185
from the North Pole must be

1608
01:11:04.185 --> 01:11:05.686
getting pretty expensive,

1609
01:11:05.686 --> 01:11:07.229
so I'll be brief.

1610
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:09.940
Step one foot onto this property

1611
01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:11.317
and I'll use your friends

1612
01:11:11.317 --> 01:11:13.944
in my next experiment.

1613
01:11:13.944 --> 01:11:17.615
Until next year, Santa.

1614
01:11:27.666 --> 01:11:31.504
Gentlemen, we have a mission.

1615
01:11:31.504 --> 01:11:32.755
Yes.

1616
01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:36.467
Aah!

1617
01:11:48.813 --> 01:11:50.397
Mm-hmm.

1618
01:11:50.397 --> 01:11:51.524
Tuck in that trowel.

1619
01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:52.525
Very good, Sir.

1620
01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:53.734
Pierre, put a shine

1621
01:11:53.734 --> 01:11:54.944
on that garlic press,

1622
01:11:54.944 --> 01:11:57.154
and clean up that lug wrench.

1623
01:11:57.154 --> 01:11:59.782
Okay, mount up.

1624
01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:02.159
Shotgun!

1625
01:12:02.159 --> 01:12:04.203
I got...

1626
01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:15.673
All right, men.

1627
01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:20.344
Let's go spread

1628
01:12:20.344 --> 01:12:21.804
a little Christmas Cheer.

1629
01:12:29.103 --> 01:12:31.856
Tell Mr. Frost five minutes!

1630
01:12:41.115 --> 01:12:43.784
Do you realize how fast

1631
01:12:43.784 --> 01:12:45.286
you were going?

1632
01:12:45.286 --> 01:12:46.871
Oh, no. No.

1633
01:12:46.871 --> 01:12:49.081
Tougher. Tougher. Tougher.

1634
01:12:49.081 --> 01:12:50.541
Hey!

1635
01:12:51.876 --> 01:12:54.712
Turkey Breath, do you realize

1636
01:12:54.712 --> 01:12:56.714
how fast you were going?

1637
01:13:03.387 --> 01:13:05.389
The terrorists.

1638
01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:08.517
Control!!!

1639
01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.904
We have company, Sir.

1640
01:13:24.241 --> 01:13:25.743
Just one?

1641
01:13:25.743 --> 01:13:27.369
No problem.

1642
01:13:34.084 --> 01:13:37.171
Hmm. More unexpected guests?

1643
01:13:37.171 --> 01:13:38.672
We'll just have to handle it

1644
01:13:38.672 --> 01:13:39.924
Blake's Way. Pierre?

1645
01:13:39.924 --> 01:13:42.843
The first course, please.

1646
01:13:42.843 --> 01:13:44.261
Let 'em try some

1647
01:13:44.261 --> 01:13:45.638
of Blake's Way salad oil.

1648
01:13:45.638 --> 01:13:46.639
No cholesterol.

1649
01:13:46.639 --> 01:13:48.766
Only three calories per serving!

1650
01:13:48.766 --> 01:13:52.019
And it goes down smooth.

1651
01:13:53.103 --> 01:13:55.356
What the???

1652
01:14:01.946 --> 01:14:03.614
How 'bout some Blake's Way

1653
01:14:03.614 --> 01:14:04.615
Protein Powder

1654
01:14:04.615 --> 01:14:07.242
for our little friends?

1655
01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:08.577
I was at Desert Storm,

1656
01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:09.620
you know!

1657
01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.621
I'm bad!

1658
01:14:10.621 --> 01:14:12.456
I'm a heartbreaker!

1659
01:14:12.456 --> 01:14:16.752
I'm a troublemaker!

1660
01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.218
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1661
01:14:47.491 --> 01:14:48.993
That'll teach you

1662
01:14:48.993 --> 01:14:52.287
to mess with Thomas P. Hinkley.

1663
01:15:00.504 --> 01:15:03.007
Is surrender an option, Sir?

1664
01:15:03.007 --> 01:15:04.800
What do you think, Chas?

1665
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.468
Blake's Rule 20, Sir,

1666
01:15:06.468 --> 01:15:09.304
is never surrender.

1667
01:15:23.694 --> 01:15:25.362
No!

1668
01:15:32.244 --> 01:15:34.288
Which one of you turkeys

1669
01:15:34.288 --> 01:15:36.707
is responsible for this?

1670
01:15:38.625 --> 01:15:40.044
Not me.

1671
01:15:40.044 --> 01:15:43.088
See you, suckers! Ha ha ha!

1672
01:15:45.799 --> 01:15:49.303
You take it.

1673
01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:12.659
Jumpstart.

1674
01:16:52.199 --> 01:16:53.200
Chas, go to

1675
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.327
the back entrance.

1676
01:16:55.327 --> 01:16:56.912
I'm gonna find the children

1677
01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:59.164
and get the adults upstairs.

1678
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.609
What are you doing?

1679
01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:29.236
Waving to Santa.

1680
01:17:29.236 --> 01:17:32.239
Hi, Santa!

1681
01:17:40.414 --> 01:17:41.415
Uhh!

1682
01:17:41.415 --> 01:17:42.916
Get him!

1683
01:17:42.916 --> 01:17:43.792
You guys okay?

1684
01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:44.668
Yeah.

1685
01:17:44.668 --> 01:17:45.669
You're not really

1686
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:46.879
Santa Claus, are you?

1687
01:17:46.879 --> 01:17:47.880
No, I'm not.

1688
01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.173
I just thought I was

1689
01:17:49.173 --> 01:17:50.174
for a while.

1690
01:17:50.174 --> 01:17:52.176
My name is Blake Thorne.

1691
01:17:52.176 --> 01:17:54.178
You're not Santa.

1692
01:17:54.178 --> 01:17:56.430
You're better.

1693
01:17:58.682 --> 01:17:59.808
We have an operation

1694
01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:00.976
to carry out.

1695
01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:01.977
You guys with me?

1696
01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:03.020
Yeah, of course!

1697
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.354
Where are the others?

1698
01:18:04.354 --> 01:18:05.522
The science geeks

1699
01:18:05.522 --> 01:18:06.523
took them upstairs.

1700
01:18:06.523 --> 01:18:08.192
Okay, let's try to find them

1701
01:18:08.192 --> 01:18:09.526
and let's stay together.

1702
01:18:09.526 --> 01:18:11.862
Okay.

1703
01:18:15.866 --> 01:18:17.451
Your weapon, Monsieur.

1704
01:18:17.451 --> 01:18:18.619
Thanks.

1705
01:18:41.892 --> 01:18:44.519
See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!

1706
01:18:47.439 --> 01:18:48.982
Hey! Hey! Whoa!

1707
01:18:48.982 --> 01:18:52.069
No, no! Aah!

1708
01:18:55.739 --> 01:18:57.407
Yeah, come on!

1709
01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:08.001
Aah!

1710
01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:18.845
Oh, whoa.

1711
01:19:18.845 --> 01:19:20.889
Aah!

1712
01:19:22.599 --> 01:19:24.393
Let's go find Leslie.

1713
01:19:28.105 --> 01:19:29.940
Ho ho ho!

1714
01:19:40.867 --> 01:19:43.245
Hey, where'd Blake go?

1715
01:19:49.793 --> 01:19:51.962
Hello, Santa.

1716
01:19:51.962 --> 01:19:53.130
I'm afraid I've been

1717
01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:55.799
terribly, terribly naughty.

1718
01:19:55.799 --> 01:19:57.593
No problemo.

1719
01:19:57.593 --> 01:19:59.094
I haven't had a good workout

1720
01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.095
in a week.

1721
01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:01.805
In case you haven't noticed,

1722
01:20:01.805 --> 01:20:03.265
the odds have changed.

1723
01:20:15.569 --> 01:20:17.988
Wah!

1724
01:20:24.411 --> 01:20:26.663
You wouldn't hit a woman.

1725
01:20:26.663 --> 01:20:27.664
Would you?

1726
01:20:27.664 --> 01:20:29.750
He wouldn't...

1727
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:31.918
But I would.

1728
01:20:31.918 --> 01:20:34.838
Aah! Aah!

1729
01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:39.718
Ouch.

1730
01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.069
Lenny, great to see you.

1731
01:20:57.069 --> 01:20:58.528
Thanks.

1732
01:20:58.528 --> 01:21:02.324
No. Thank you,

1733
01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:03.825
Mr. Thorne.

1734
01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:04.993
It's all there.

1735
01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:05.994
Well, except for

1736
01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:07.621
a couple of bucks.

1737
01:21:07.621 --> 01:21:09.206
Lenny!

1738
01:21:09.206 --> 01:21:10.540
You're not gonna hug me

1739
01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:12.542
or nothing, are you?

1740
01:21:12.542 --> 01:21:14.419
Let's go find Leslie

1741
01:21:14.419 --> 01:21:16.046
and Clayton, come on.

1742
01:21:16.046 --> 01:21:17.047
All right.

1743
01:21:24.888 --> 01:21:26.890
Well, all you had to do

1744
01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:29.226
was knock.

1745
01:21:29.226 --> 01:21:30.227
Are you okay?

1746
01:21:30.227 --> 01:21:32.229
Are you okay?

1747
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:33.480
I am now.

1748
01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.481
I'm Blake Thorne.

1749
01:21:34.481 --> 01:21:36.191
Good to meet ya.

1750
01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:37.192
Let's go.

1751
01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:38.527
I've got to find

1752
01:21:38.527 --> 01:21:40.112
The children.

1753
01:21:40.112 --> 01:21:41.571
Uh, Blake, Blake.

1754
01:21:41.571 --> 01:21:42.739
I'd like to talk to you

1755
01:21:42.739 --> 01:21:43.824
a minute.

1756
01:21:43.824 --> 01:21:45.867
Have a seat.

1757
01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:49.579
Yeah. Have a seat.

1758
01:21:49.579 --> 01:21:53.333
Hey, you lied to her.

1759
01:21:53.333 --> 01:21:56.670
Blake Thorne? What's the matter.

1760
01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:58.880
Blake Tarachefski

1761
01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.425
doesn't fit on the bottle?

1762
01:22:02.926 --> 01:22:04.594
How did you...?

1763
01:22:04.594 --> 01:22:05.846
Isn't it coming back

1764
01:22:05.846 --> 01:22:07.097
to you yet, Son?

1765
01:22:07.097 --> 01:22:12.018
You grew up here! Look.

1766
01:22:12.018 --> 01:22:13.019
Is that me?

1767
01:22:13.019 --> 01:22:14.187
There's more.

1768
01:22:14.187 --> 01:22:15.439
You see the boy sitting

1769
01:22:15.439 --> 01:22:16.440
right next to you?

1770
01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.191
He was your best friend.

1771
01:22:18.191 --> 01:22:19.985
Ebner Frost.

1772
01:22:26.616 --> 01:22:29.453
Aw! Do I have to do

1773
01:22:29.453 --> 01:22:31.371
everything myself?

1774
01:22:31.371 --> 01:22:32.497
Huh? Do I?

1775
01:22:32.497 --> 01:22:33.707
"Yes, you do, Percy."

1776
01:22:33.707 --> 01:22:35.292
"Why?" "'Cause you surround

1777
01:22:35.292 --> 01:22:36.793
yourself with nincompoops

1778
01:22:36.793 --> 01:22:39.212
like me." Gah! Wretched.

1779
01:22:39.212 --> 01:22:40.464
Mother said there'd be

1780
01:22:40.464 --> 01:22:42.048
nights like this.

1781
01:22:42.048 --> 01:22:43.758
Nights like this!

1782
01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:49.139
Hi!

1783
01:22:49.139 --> 01:22:50.724
Just couldn't stay away

1784
01:22:50.724 --> 01:22:52.642
from me, huh?

1785
01:22:52.642 --> 01:22:53.643
That's okay, I..

1786
01:22:53.643 --> 01:22:55.645
I have that effect on women.

1787
01:22:55.645 --> 01:22:56.813
So much has gone on.

1788
01:22:56.813 --> 01:22:58.899
I'm so confused.

1789
01:22:58.899 --> 01:23:00.150
Well, don't fret.

1790
01:23:00.150 --> 01:23:01.902
It just so happens

1791
01:23:01.902 --> 01:23:03.445
I'm a specialist in...

1792
01:23:03.445 --> 01:23:04.446
Matters

1793
01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:06.323
of the heart, too.

1794
01:23:06.323 --> 01:23:09.117
Oh, are you really, Doctor?

1795
01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:11.328
Well, maybe you can give me

1796
01:23:11.328 --> 01:23:13.330
some advice.

1797
01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:14.623
Why, Leslie.

1798
01:23:14.623 --> 01:23:15.791
You certainly are

1799
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:16.833
a different person

1800
01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:17.834
when you're away

1801
01:23:17.834 --> 01:23:19.002
from those homeless

1802
01:23:19.002 --> 01:23:21.129
little losers, aren't you?

1803
01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:22.339
Listen, you pig!

1804
01:23:22.339 --> 01:23:26.176
Nobody! Talks! About!

1805
01:23:26.176 --> 01:23:29.513
My! Kids! That! Way!

1806
01:23:29.513 --> 01:23:30.514
Whoa!

1807
01:23:30.514 --> 01:23:32.182
Yeah! Yes!

1808
01:23:32.182 --> 01:23:34.017
Hey, that's not funny!

1809
01:23:34.017 --> 01:23:35.018
Great job!

1810
01:23:35.018 --> 01:23:36.353
Now we've gotta get outta here.

1811
01:23:36.353 --> 01:23:37.729
What about Blake?

1812
01:23:37.729 --> 01:23:38.605
We're a team!

1813
01:23:38.605 --> 01:23:40.065
Taylor! Let's go!

1814
01:23:40.065 --> 01:23:41.399
Come on! Aah!

1815
01:23:41.399 --> 01:23:42.400
Come back here,

1816
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.861
you little brats!

1817
01:24:14.724 --> 01:24:16.226
I can't let you do

1818
01:24:16.226 --> 01:24:18.645
this, Ebby.

1819
01:24:18.645 --> 01:24:20.730
Ebby?

1820
01:24:20.730 --> 01:24:21.940
What's wrong?

1821
01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.024
Haven't heard that

1822
01:24:23.024 --> 01:24:24.568
since we were kids?

1823
01:24:26.403 --> 01:24:28.697
Blake!

1824
01:24:28.697 --> 01:24:31.575
Blake Tarachefski.

1825
01:24:31.575 --> 01:24:32.576
So, you're the one

1826
01:24:32.576 --> 01:24:34.995
who's been causing all my pain?

1827
01:24:34.995 --> 01:24:36.997
Maybe I have, but I'm gonna

1828
01:24:36.997 --> 01:24:38.415
put a stop to all of this.

1829
01:24:38.415 --> 01:24:39.499
Oh, you're going

1830
01:24:39.499 --> 01:24:41.251
to stop me?

1831
01:24:41.251 --> 01:24:42.794
You got it.

1832
01:24:44.129 --> 01:24:45.130
I got it!

1833
01:24:48.008 --> 01:24:49.634
Aah!

1834
01:24:49.634 --> 01:24:52.596
Oh! It's beautiful!

1835
01:24:52.596 --> 01:24:54.598
(Gibbering)

1836
01:25:00.145 --> 01:25:02.272
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

1837
01:25:06.192 --> 01:25:07.569
Yeehaw!

1838
01:25:10.447 --> 01:25:12.324
These are good folks, Ebby.

1839
01:25:12.324 --> 01:25:13.366
Leave 'em alone.

1840
01:25:13.366 --> 01:25:15.952
You got a problem with me,

1841
01:25:15.952 --> 01:25:17.704
let's take it outside.

1842
01:25:17.704 --> 01:25:20.206
Would you shut up already?

1843
01:25:20.206 --> 01:25:21.666
Don't flatter yourself.

1844
01:25:21.666 --> 01:25:24.169
This is about money!

1845
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:25.879
Lots of money.

1846
01:25:32.302 --> 01:25:33.720
What happened, Ebby?

1847
01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.555
You used to be a good kid.

1848
01:25:35.555 --> 01:25:38.308
Spare me the lecture.

1849
01:25:38.308 --> 01:25:39.726
While you're off spending

1850
01:25:39.726 --> 01:25:41.311
mommy and daddy's millions,

1851
01:25:41.311 --> 01:25:42.646
I was rotting away

1852
01:25:42.646 --> 01:25:44.648
in this place.

1853
01:25:44.648 --> 01:25:46.650
I had to cheat and steal

1854
01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:49.152
to claw my way out of here!

1855
01:25:49.152 --> 01:25:50.654
While you're up in a mansion

1856
01:25:50.654 --> 01:25:51.655
in a hill.

1857
01:25:51.655 --> 01:25:52.781
Why don't you go back

1858
01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:53.823
to your weight room

1859
01:25:53.823 --> 01:25:55.367
and your tanning booth!

1860
01:25:55.367 --> 01:25:57.952
Well, you know what?

1861
01:25:57.952 --> 01:26:00.163
Being Santa opened my eyes.

1862
01:26:00.163 --> 01:26:03.124
I didn't like what I saw.

1863
01:26:12.884 --> 01:26:16.137
Oh! Uhh!

1864
01:26:25.188 --> 01:26:29.359
Sarah! Elizabeth! Taylor!

1865
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:33.571
I was the one

1866
01:26:33.571 --> 01:26:35.115
that should've been adopted.

1867
01:26:35.115 --> 01:26:36.408
It's my turn!

1868
01:26:36.408 --> 01:26:37.742
Well, now it's my turn

1869
01:26:37.742 --> 01:26:40.120
to set you straight.

1870
01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:41.121
Leslie!

1871
01:26:41.121 --> 01:26:43.039
Too late!

1872
01:26:43.039 --> 01:26:45.208
We're not kids anymore.

1873
01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.545
Come on.

1874
01:27:16.281 --> 01:27:18.992
Die! Die!

1875
01:27:18.992 --> 01:27:20.702
Well, we can't just sit here!

1876
01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:22.078
Come on! Stay here!

1877
01:27:22.078 --> 01:27:24.581
I
-I could do that.

1878
01:27:26.791 --> 01:27:27.876
Ha!

1879
01:27:34.090 --> 01:27:36.009
Ooh ooh! Yeah!

1880
01:27:44.476 --> 01:27:45.477
Uh...

1881
01:27:50.190 --> 01:27:51.858
What's happening?

1882
01:27:51.858 --> 01:27:53.610
Rapid vibrations are causing

1883
01:27:53.610 --> 01:27:55.320
an energy build-up.

1884
01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.446
English, please.

1885
01:27:56.446 --> 01:27:58.615
It's.. It's..

1886
01:27:58.615 --> 01:28:00.784
It's gonna blow!

1887
01:28:01.785 --> 01:28:03.119
Let's get out of here!

1888
01:28:03.119 --> 01:28:04.162
Let's go!

1889
01:28:04.162 --> 01:28:05.455
Come on!

1890
01:28:05.455 --> 01:28:07.165
Come on, Frost!

1891
01:28:07.165 --> 01:28:09.125
Let it go!

1892
01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:10.460
Move it!

1893
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:12.504
Oh, come on, Guys.

1894
01:28:12.504 --> 01:28:14.798
Move, move, move!

1895
01:28:14.798 --> 01:28:16.132
Come on.

1896
01:28:16.132 --> 01:28:18.051
Get over here.

1897
01:28:32.649 --> 01:28:34.442
Go on, move it.

1898
01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:36.903
Push it.

1899
01:28:36.903 --> 01:28:39.489
Don't look back.

1900
01:28:42.408 --> 01:28:44.494
Come on, Frost.

1901
01:28:44.494 --> 01:28:45.995
(Gibbering)

1902
01:28:49.874 --> 01:28:52.460
Come on, Frost.

1903
01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:13.773
Cool.

1904
01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:25.535
No!

1905
01:30:02.739 --> 01:30:04.490
All right!

1906
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:06.159
Everyone freeze!

1907
01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:10.079
Good.

1908
01:30:11.331 --> 01:30:13.124
Uh, Ma'am, please...

1909
01:30:20.465 --> 01:30:21.925
Are we rolling?

1910
01:30:21.925 --> 01:30:23.343
Hi, Helen Chu with News 8.

1911
01:30:23.343 --> 01:30:24.677
Officer, please tell us

1912
01:30:24.677 --> 01:30:26.262
how you finally apprehended

1913
01:30:26.262 --> 01:30:27.764
Ebner Frost and his gang.

1914
01:30:27.764 --> 01:30:29.891
Well, it wasn't easy, Helen.

1915
01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:31.935
May I call you Helen?

1916
01:30:31.935 --> 01:30:33.061
Got one more here.

1917
01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:34.270
It took exhaustive

1918
01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:35.772
investigative reporting.

1919
01:30:35.772 --> 01:30:37.106
Excuse me, Helen Chu,

1920
01:30:37.106 --> 01:30:38.316
News 8. Can you tell us

1921
01:30:38.316 --> 01:30:39.400
who did this to you?

1922
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.652
Go away!

1923
01:30:40.652 --> 01:30:41.736
I just want to ask

1924
01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:42.946
a few questions, Sir.

1925
01:30:42.946 --> 01:30:44.489
I guess he'll have a chance

1926
01:30:44.489 --> 01:30:46.282
to De
-Frost himself!

1927
01:30:48.493 --> 01:30:51.621
I'll get you, Santa.

1928
01:30:51.621 --> 01:30:53.081
Gonna get you, Santa.

1929
01:30:53.081 --> 01:30:55.249
I'm gonna get!!!

1930
01:30:56.793 --> 01:30:57.794
Hi, excuse me.

1931
01:30:57.794 --> 01:30:58.920
Helen Chu of News 8.

1932
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.546
Just a couple of questions...

1933
01:31:00.546 --> 01:31:03.007
Ew! Ugh!

1934
01:31:03.007 --> 01:31:04.342
Were you responsible

1935
01:31:04.342 --> 01:31:05.843
for the explosion earlier?

1936
01:31:05.843 --> 01:31:07.178
Are you responsible...

1937
01:31:08.846 --> 01:31:11.307
Oh! Ick!

1938
01:31:11.307 --> 01:31:14.227
Oh, my sense of smell!

1939
01:31:18.898 --> 01:31:21.818
You can't do this!

1940
01:31:21.818 --> 01:31:23.111
It's inhuman!

1941
01:31:23.111 --> 01:31:24.362
It's unethical!

1942
01:31:24.362 --> 01:31:27.782
It.. It.. It stinks in here!

1943
01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:36.541
I'm not through

1944
01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:39.002
with you, Blake.

1945
01:31:39.002 --> 01:31:40.336
I'm just get start..

1946
01:31:42.088 --> 01:31:45.717
Merry Christmas, Ebner!

1947
01:31:45.717 --> 01:31:48.594
Well, you did an amazing job

1948
01:31:48.594 --> 01:31:50.013
cleaning all that up,

1949
01:31:50.013 --> 01:31:52.598
but where we gonna go now?

1950
01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:10.825
I think I know

1951
01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:13.161
a place that's available.

1952
01:32:26.341 --> 01:32:27.342
Hey, watch it!

1953
01:32:27.342 --> 01:32:28.343
I'm tanning!

1954
01:32:28.343 --> 01:32:30.428
I'm tanning here!

1955
01:32:37.185 --> 01:32:39.020
Hey!

1956
01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.272
Slow down, boy!

1957
01:32:46.986 --> 01:32:49.155
Duck, duck, goose!

1958
01:32:49.155 --> 01:32:52.033
Blake, is it time?

1959
01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:53.201
Yes! Come on, Guys!

1960
01:32:53.201 --> 01:32:55.036
Come on!

1961
01:32:59.123 --> 01:33:00.792
All right!

1962
01:33:00.792 --> 01:33:02.210
What are you looking at?

1963
01:33:02.210 --> 01:33:03.211
Move out of there.

1964
01:33:03.211 --> 01:33:04.295
That's my trash!

1965
01:33:04.295 --> 01:33:06.381
Lemme see, lemme see!

1966
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.851
Wow! A Christmas Miracle.

1967
01:33:18.851 --> 01:33:20.561
I do believe in you.

1968
01:33:22.355 --> 01:33:23.731
Blake.

1969
01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:25.566
Ho ho ho!

1970
01:33:25.566 --> 01:33:27.652
Yeah!
