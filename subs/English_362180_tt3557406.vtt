1
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.960
I do not know where my mother is.

2
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.800
I dunno.

3
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.240
I have no news from ...

4
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.200
three years.

5
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.840
My mother abandoned me.

6
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.520
It is not even on my birth certificate.

7
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.160
I was placed in foster care live.

8
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.800
The woman treated me like shit.

9
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.800
To her, I was a cockroach.

10
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.800
The atomic bomb would
have done anything to me.

11
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.560
I do not like talking about my father.

12
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.160
Will it work for me, 
I'll cartoning.

13
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.480
Liam, we will work in his father's box.

14
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
Something sites. 
It will pass us.

15
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.480
It will be ours and we will grow.

16
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.600
We will have plenty of taf.

17
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
All over.

18
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.440
Money !

19
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.200
Shawn is ...

20
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.080
it's like my little brother.

21
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.440
The brother I never had.

22
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.040
He would do everything for
me and I for him.

23
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.240
My brother...

24
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.240
It is always gentle and kind.

25
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.760
It is a model for me.

26
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.440
Sure, I want children.

27
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.160
First, I want to work.

28
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.240
I want to find a good job.

29
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.440
I want to provide for my children.

30
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.000
Like that they lack nothing.

31
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.400
Stop, Liam.

32
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.120
I said no.

33
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.520
You bloated me with your "no."

34
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.320
I do not want.

35
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.680
Si, t'as envie.

36
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.760
I offer my body for
your 18 and you throw me.

37
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.040
T'es naze.

38
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.480
Brothel!

39
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.080
You do shit, May!

40
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.760
I'm fed up.

41
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.080
I'm outta here.

42
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.440
- Shut up ! 
- What?

43
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.560
You also want to?

44
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.640
Are not you a little young? With you, 
I risk the jail.

45
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.760
Emerges, Liam!

46
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.160
- Largue this guy. 
- At least I have one myself.

47
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.400
So what ? Soon you'll break you.

48
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.360
Damn, you're 18 today!

49
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.160
Outside, get thee to do anything that stupid.

50
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.120
Moves!

51
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.160
Come on!

52
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.000
Stopped !

53
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.040
I love your little ears.

54
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.040
Stopped !

55
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.600
Do not touch me.

56
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.080
You're going to sleep with him?

57
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.000
Why not ?

58
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.480
I majeure.

59
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.000
T'as de la chance.

60
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.280
I'm not yet a party.

61
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.360
I have no answer to the TAF.

62
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.120
If I have nothing else,

63
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.680
I will stay in this rotten supermarket.

64
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.120
It's going to work.

65
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.960
It still works for you.

66
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.480
I warn you,

67
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.080
I have no gifts.

68
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.320
It is not serious.

69
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.120
Especially, choure nothing in my
job, they would turn to me.

70
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.680
Happy Birthday !

71
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.280
Chicks, who wants to fuck Shawn?

72
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.520
J'arrive !

73
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.840
When thou hast washed?

74
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.280
Here.

75
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.960
- You're sure ? 
- Let go of me !

76
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.120
What are you doing ?

77
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.120
- Do not move ! 
- You stresses me.

78
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.880
What do we do girls?

79
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.600
It is where, Anton, that con educator?

80
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.040
He pulled car.

81
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.560
He had serious booze.

82
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.320
It must do shit to holiday

83
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.920
locked up with us.

84
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.320
The others are with their families,

85
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.960
us, we do not.

86
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.440
This is the class!

87
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.440
When we will be crossed,
this hole not fail you.

88
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.160
- You take me? 
- Must see.

89
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.160
What do I get in exchange ?

90
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.640
Very funny !

91
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.200
You look like a shrimp.

92
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.280
My father knows a billionaire.

93
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.600
We lent our boat.

94
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.200
Your father has a boat?

95
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.880
Rather it is a yacht.

96
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.640
Why are you here then?

97
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.520
the more you play?

98
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.560
It intoxicates me. 
What time is it ?

99
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.960
You're not funny.

100
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.040
You did it in one direction.

101
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.760
It is useless.

102
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.800
Do a cross.

103
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.160
That's what I did.

104
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.160
But it found me before I pass.

105
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.080
I'll get there one day.

106
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.080
You really barge.

107
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.720
It's that one ?

108
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.240
You vas-y!

109
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.840
Turn.

110
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.400
Shawn, lights!

111
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.400
Look.

112
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.800
Fucking shame!

113
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.840
- They are there ? 
- What?

114
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.840
- Our notebooks. 
- Calls by!

115
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.120
I do not know his number.

116
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.920
The say picole serious.

117
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.280
I knew it.

118
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.880
What a bitch!

119
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.600
She piqued my grass.

120
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.800
Look.

121
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.960
Our records!

122
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.160
"We advocate a center will receive Bastian

123
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.880
"Psychological help suitable to him."

124
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040
"His case" ?

125
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.760
The trick phew!

126
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.920
They believe the weak.

127
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.240
You want to see yours?

128
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.160
I do not care, I have one.

129
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.960
Is there an answer to your TAF?

130
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.720
Nothing.

131
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.040
I do not care, 
I'm going with Liam.

132
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.840
Not get excited.

133
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.000
Do not worry, honey, I'm here.

134
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.400
OK, handsome.

135
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.880
You're kids.

136
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.480
I do not need you.

137
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.320
I'll find me a real man.

138
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.840
Who will want to kiss you?

139
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.680
Fuck you put!

140
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.320
Pass the bottle.

141
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.600
Hold five seconds!

142
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.920
The pass to Thomas.

143
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.760
Wood !

144
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.680
You vas-y!

145
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.720
Wood !

146
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.800
Come on!

147
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.400
Wood !

148
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.360
Go ahead, turn!

149
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.280
Va-t'en!

150
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.160
Tell me why you're not at school, damn!

151
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.960
You're going to answer me?

152
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.360
Stop whining!

153
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.280
Go away !

154
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.640
You want to take you, too?

155
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.440
Bute me, bitch!

156
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.320
Leave him alone !

157
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.680
If you touch him again, 
I'll kill you!

158
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.520
I was placed in foster care live.

159
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.200
My future, I think so too.

160
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.880
I never leave this shitty island.

161
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.720
I'll end with a guy who hit me.

162
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.440
I will have obese children.

163
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.680
I laugh.

164
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.400
I do not want to dream too much.

165
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.360
Money,

166
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.800
the clothes, the prince ...

167
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.360
it's not for me.

168
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.080
Master Chef is ready soon? 
I have more grass.

169
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.280
Calm, je m'applique.

170
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.080
Verse.

171
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.360
I do not chow that.

172
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.520
Dinner ...

173
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.760
is served.

174
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.320
T'abuses !

175
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.600
They will kill us.

176
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.120
You'll see.

177
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.400
Stop, it is already quite broken.

178
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.360
Take care of your ass.

179
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.240
May, just kidding.

180
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.360
Do not get mad.

181
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.120
Leave her, she has her period.

182
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:39.840
What?

183
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.000
Say again !

184
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.440
- What did you say ? 
- Nothing.

185
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.560
If, as you said something.

186
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.040
- But no. 
- Yes.

187
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.600
Where did you get that?

188
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.040
- Anton farted our laptops. 
- The bastard!

189
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.560
It's fucked up.

190
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.040
- I'll fix it. 
- He is dead.

191
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.800
Who cares, portable. 
What do we do there?

192
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.160
- You got the keys to the supermarket? 
- Forget it.

193
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320
Come on!

194
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.920
It's your birthday and there
will be nobody down there.

195
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.040
There's more to eat
or booze, here we go.

196
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.960
Come on!

197
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.960
I do not want.

198
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.080
One.

199
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.640
I am sorry.

200
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.840
I do not feel good.

201
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.240
It's disgusting !

202
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:28.920
Pork !

203
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.040
We shoot, Thomas will repaint the floor.

204
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.280
You come with us ?

205
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.360
If you prefer, we remain both here.

206
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.440
What are you looking for ?

207
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.160
Nothing at all.

208
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.040
You are crazy, no one has
the right to get out of here.

209
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.320
Shut up !

210
00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.880
They leave us alone, they
do not care, our mouths.

211
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.920
- This sucks. 
- You speak !

212
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.200
I'm not supposed to have the key.

213
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.920
Do not worry, they will not.

214
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.480
Taking beers, some food and we are shooting.

215
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.200
You have to give a shit.

216
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.200
Look, this is the car of Anton!

217
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.280
Whore !

218
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.160
We have to go home.

219
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.560
He is right.

220
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.840
You make shit!

221
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.960
We go to the supermarket. 
He will tell us what?

222
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.120
He drank and fucked in
her car instead of watching us.

223
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.160
Wait for me, Liam.

224
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.680
On y va.

225
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.160
Give me the keys.

226
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.600
What?

227
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.760
I want to return to the home.

228
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.960
Go ahead, I do not need you.

229
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.640
She's right, it sucks.

230
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800
Shut up !

231
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.880
We did not come for nothing.

232
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.360
Wait for us here, May.

233
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.600
They'll just take beers.

234
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.440
Bastian, you come?

235
00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.480
What?

236
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.280
They are right at home ...

237
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.320
es Frosted you.

238
00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.240
It remains with us.

239
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.280
Okay ?

240
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720
Shawn ?

241
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.160
Shit, I'm going!

242
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.400
Thomas ?

243
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.360
I dunno...

244
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.200
Okay.

245
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.080
It's dead here.

246
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.320
I told you that there would be one.

247
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.520
Come.

248
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.680
We should not do that.

249
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.440
Shut up and bring you.

250
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.000
Bastian, what are you doing?

251
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.720
What is he doing?

252
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.440
Let us not alone.

253
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.520
Did you want to do you?

254
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:30.880
What?

255
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.880
This whack? You're ill !

256
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.560
Stay away from Liam.

257
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.000
I do what I want with your Liam.

258
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.800
You think he prefers you to me?

259
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.200
You are watched you?

260
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.720
Normal guy hast not you,
you're acting like a whore!

261
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:48.880
Sorry.

262
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.160
Leave me.

263
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.720
That's it.

264
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.120
Out!

265
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.560
- You take it. 
- Yeah.

266
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.480
Mate that!

267
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.160
The latest! They are expensive.

268
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.520
Cool !

269
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.840
Shawn !

270
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.240
Thomas, this is your brother.

271
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.560
Shut up !

272
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.240
What's the matter ?

273
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.760
Emergency situation.

274
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.640
Stay home.

275
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.880
Do not leave home ...

276
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.280
Damn, it's the end
of the world or what?

277
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.200
Must go.

278
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.400
Shit!

279
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.120
Whore !

280
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.720
They left the money.

281
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.360
And a gun!

282
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.160
You're gonna do what?

283
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.480
We bar.

284
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.920
All right, they will not nab us.

285
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.400
They are all home because
of this message to the con.

286
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.600
Anton ?

287
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.600
Shit !

288
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.920
You have a new message.

289
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.920
Received yesterday at 20 h 47.

290
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.600
It's me, bro.

291
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.000
I'm stuck on the
continent, we can not embark.

292
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.840
I do not know what is.

293
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.360
I'll call you back.

294
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.200
Whore !

295
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.000
It's okay ?

296
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.120
What's your name ?

297
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.200
Holly.

298
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.960
Come with me.

299
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.440
I will help you.

300
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.560
Non.

301
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.200
Someone will take care of your mom.

302
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.040
They are all wicked.

303
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:19.920
Who ?

304
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.760
Great people.

305
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.200
What great people?

306
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.200
All great people.

307
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.360
Madame...

308
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.480
Mom !

309
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.320
What are you doing ?

310
00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.800
Stop!

311
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.360
What are you doing ?

312
00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.280
Holly !

313
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.800
Anton ?

314
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.160
It's okay ?

315
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.520
We saw your car in the street.

316
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.360
Everything is fine ?

317
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.800
- You like that? 
- No.

318
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.640
Come, we are shooting.

319
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.800
Ham or chicken?

320
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.640
Fuck. Let's go !

321
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.960
You have taken in enough. Come on!

322
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.480
What?

323
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.280
Whore !

324
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.440
For God Sake !

325
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.120
Tire hell!

326
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.840
Bend down !

327
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.560
Pearl !

328
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.560
Must go!

329
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.440
One!

330
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.600
- Why ? 
- Quick !

331
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.720
Tire !

332
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.680
You vas-y!

333
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.320
May !

334
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.600
What do you have ?

335
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.480
Anton went crazy, he hit me.

336
00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.800
Stop!

337
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.280
Stop the car!

338
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.960
- Get in! 
- What is this mess ?

339
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.200
Go behind crawling!

340
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.320
Monte !

341
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.440
- Where's Thomas? 
- He is dead.

342
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.600
- What are you saying ? 
- He is dead !

343
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.680
- Starts, Liam! 
- I try !

344
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.280
Started !

345
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.000
Start fucking!

346
00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:39.960
What is happening ?

347
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.720
I am in pain.

348
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.800
It's horrible !

349
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.120
She's bleeding a lot!

350
00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.200
Brothel!

351
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.240
- Should help. 
- We can do nothing !

352
00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.600
Hold on, May.

353
00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.520
I'm at the port,
the ferry returning to dock.

354
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.360
The passengers panicked.

355
00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.120
We just learned that access to Island Northlands

356
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.000
is prohibited for the moment.

357
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.920
No departure nor arrival is permitted.

358
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.240
Serious incidents were reported.

359
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.680
We are waiting for new information.

360
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.040
Communications ...

361
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.160
"Incidents", my ass! 
They wanted to kill us.

362
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.360
We're all going to die.

363
00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.720
What's your name ?

364
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.720
Harry.

365
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.640
What happened ?

366
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.080
My father killed my
sister ?? s like that.

367
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.480
Look.

368
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.400
Not stop you, Liam.

369
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.360
Shit !

370
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.160
The bastard!

371
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.720
May, okay?

372
00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.640
Now what the fuck?

373
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.840
He comes !

374
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.360
Harry !

375
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.240
Tire !

376
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.360
Give me the gun.

377
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.400
Tire, damn!

378
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.880
Give it to me.

379
00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.720
His !

380
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.480
It is like them!

381
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.360
Shut your mouth.

382
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.360
I'm not like them.

383
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.160
I have nothing, I tell you.

384
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.480
Why he said that to you?

385
00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.280
You gonna shoot me?

386
00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.760
Kiss my ass !

387
00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.400
Help her get up and breaks.

388
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.920
Pearl, help me.

389
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.360
Must draw from this island of freaks.

390
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.640
We'll find a safe
place May, it will go.

391
00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.720
Do not worry.

392
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.560
And if there are people in it?

393
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.760
Like the others ?

394
00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.960
It is armed.

395
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.280
Come.

396
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.680
There's nobody.

397
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.040
Liam...

398
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.920
Sorry.

399
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.880
What's this ?

400
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.640
To disinfect.

401
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.000
Brings water.

402
00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.520
This sucks!

403
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.360
More is needed.

404
00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.120
She still bleeding.

405
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:19.000
Wood.

406
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.840
It will be fine.

407
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.040
Why are you looking at me?

408
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.680
You think that your mouth, huh?

409
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.560
Little was right,

410
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.960
you become crazy.

411
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.040
What? It works ?

412
00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.280
Someone called from below.

413
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:04.960
Whore !

414
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.240
Shawn...

415
00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:24.880
Women.

416
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.000
"Mathilda, I hope you never read this letter

417
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.840
"And that you have been running away.

418
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.600
"The adults went crazy.

419
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.240
"They are killing children.

420
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.120
"I'm afraid of becoming
like them and hurt you.

421
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.880
"Do not ever trust anyone

422
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.960
"Not even those you love.

423
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.560
"Forgive me, forgive us.

424
00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.200
"Dad."

425
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.720
They are all like that.

426
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.360
Et Shawn ?

427
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.840
He is doing very well.

428
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.560
Papa ?

429
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.680
Mom not feeling well, she has a fever.

430
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.760
I'll call you back.

431
00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.120
Dad, where are you?

432
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.320
Mom worries me.

433
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.680
She talks more, it trembles.

434
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.360
T'es is?

435
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.120
I am very scared!

436
00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.120
I have to stop, 
Mom bleeding ears.

437
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:29.040
A man threw himself on the
windshield, he wanted to attack us.

438
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.040
Papa ?

439
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.160
I saw a dead body beside the road.

440
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.880
What is happening ?

441
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.320
Mathilda ?

442
00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.000
Listen, darling, I love you.

443
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.840
You're gonna do what I say.

444
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.880
Especially, not stop.

445
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.000
Listen to me !

446
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.640
Turn around immediately.

447
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.760
Take the next ferry,

448
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.360
leave the island as soon as possible!

449
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.720
It's not true !

450
00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.840
Must get out of here.

451
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.280
How crafty?

452
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.400
Whatever.

453
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.840
On foot, if necessary.

454
00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.240
As soon as it is light.

455
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.240
We will go where?

456
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.680
On the continent.

457
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.000
How? There's no more ferries.

458
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.880
Your father was not a boat?

459
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.240
And.

460
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.040
So what ?

461
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.520
Forget it. Your father must be contaminated.

462
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.680
Whatever !

463
00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.160
He is not stupid.

464
00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.080
He said nothing happened.

465
00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.200
He's waiting for me.

466
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.560
Just me.

467
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.720
Et May ?

468
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.520
Every man for himself.

469
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.920
You have someone good.

470
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.480
No one.

471
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.080
How are you feeling ?

472
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.880
Great birthday!

473
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.880
The next will be better.

474
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.200
Are interest.

475
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.240
I'm sorry.

476
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.800
I can stay ?

477
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.160
If you want.

478
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.920
I did not know you played.

479
00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.240
Not really.

480
00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.880
When we were little,

481
00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.680
?? s my heart
wanted to play the piano.

482
00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.160
But there was no piano.

483
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.920
Where is she ?

484
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.160
It's true that you have the pianist's hands.

485
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.280
Have you ever seen a pianist?

486
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.320
No, but I saw the hands.

487
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.040
Do not do that.

488
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.320
You do not like me ?

489
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.120
Why ?

490
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.880
- For several reasons. 
- Which?

491
00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.600
Y plenty.

492
00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.040
I understood, I'm not dumb.

493
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.680
Sorry.

494
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.360
It's just ...

495
00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.480
makeup go away.

496
00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.400
Pearl...

497
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.480
Stay with me.

498
00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.200
Shawn...

499
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.280
Other not believe me.

500
00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.400
I'm not sick.

501
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.240
I have not even 18 years.

502
00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.680
You believe me, do you?

503
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.760
Do you believe me ?

504
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.120
Do not worry.

505
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.680
Wake up. Must go!

506
00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.800
What are you doing ?

507
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.600
I beg you, no!

508
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.520
Help !

509
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.400
Stop whining!

510
00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.920
What did you do ?

511
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.080
Opens!

512
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.600
Open, damn!

513
00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.600
Kill me.

514
00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.560
You'll-y.

515
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.800
I can not.

516
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.520
Come down from the car.

517
00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.360
Why ?

518
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:39.800
She is beautiful, my girl, right?

519
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.800
Shawn, we wanted to get
out of this rotten island.

520
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.240
He had become like the others.

521
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.920
Maybe we.

522
00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.440
Shawn Why not us?

523
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.840
Perhaps one is sick and no one knows.

524
00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.560
There would symptoms.

525
00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.320
As Shawn?

526
00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:17.960
It would be.

527
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.680
May and Shawn loved me
and I did not care.

528
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.400
Same for my father.

529
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.200
I'm all screwed up.

530
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.320
Do not worry,

531
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.120
one will find it.

532
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.680
I lost long ago.

533
00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.680
Shit !

534
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.280
Pearl !

535
00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.360
Come quickly !

536
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.520
Get in!

537
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.280
Started !

538
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.320
Quick !

539
00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880
It's not true !

540
00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.560
It will be fine.

541
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.280
Take the address.

542
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.600
Go for it.

543
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.880
"The judge said you're
better at home with me.

544
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.880
"I retype the boat if you'd come back.

545
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.600
"I love you.

546
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.040
"Dad."

547
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.200
I would like to sleep.

548
00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:10.960
Try this.

549
00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.720
No, it's disgusting.

550
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.440
It's not easy but ...

551
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:16.800
it has a little something.

552
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:21.960
She's hot.

553
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:23.960
Okay.

554
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.320
It fits you well.

555
00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.560
Why did you do that?

556
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.360
I dunno.

557
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.080
I did, that's all.

558
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.200
And now...

559
00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:16.320
you still want to die?

560
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:17.960
Now...

561
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.440
I want to be with you.

562
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.640
You make me walk ?

563
00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.680
We could stay here.

564
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.120
That you actually say?

565
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.960
Yes, it says.

566
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.080
And if I like them?

567
00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.480
If I have something inside?

568
00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.560
Stop it, you have nothing.

569
00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.520
We are not adults.

570
00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.640
What is an adult?

571
00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.360
Shawn was younger than you.

572
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.200
It is not a question of age.

573
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.800
That's what you went through.

574
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.600
So I'm an adult.

575
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.880
I always had before all the other girls.

576
00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.000
Acne, my rules ...

577
00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.480
Do you mind, what I say?

578
00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.200
Why are you like this with me?

579
00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.720
How am I ?

580
00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.680
Nice.

581
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.760
I did not think
I was interested to you.

582
00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.840
I thought you liked Liam.

583
00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.080
I was jealous of May.

584
00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.880
I wanted to be normal.

585
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.160
As a girl who has relatives.

586
00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.640
You have me, now.

587
00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.600
I have no choice.

588
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.840
I killed my sister ?? s.

589
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.040
Its my fault.

590
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.440
Its my fault !

591
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.960
It's not your fault.

592
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.800
It's over, all that.

593
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.400
I love you.

594
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.520
Bastian !

595
00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.720
What?

596
00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:50.680
One.

597
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.960
Hurry up !

598
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.440
You not press, especially!

599
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.440
What's the matter ?

600
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.200
Come see.

601
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.280
What?

602
00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.760
It is a surprise.

603
01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.840
One.

604
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.880
Come on, yes?

605
01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.480
It is not cold.

606
01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.480
Stopped !

607
01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.520
One!

608
01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.840
What are you doing here ?

609
01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.480
We try to eat.

610
01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.000
Clear.

611
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.480
Get out, I said!

612
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:13.840
What are you doing ?

613
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.440
Take her.

614
01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.440
Come back!

615
01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.200
Not leave here!

616
01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.480
Come back!

617
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.440
We can not take care of her.

618
01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.000
You are like the others. 
You can not leave here.

619
01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.480
You will die!

620
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.360
We return.

621
01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.080
She was hungry.

622
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.640
We can not take him.

623
01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.880
Take him where?

624
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.760
It remains here?

625
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.000
No more now.

626
01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.520
So she comes with us.

627
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.720
Die!

628
01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.720
Die, motherfucker!

629
01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.760
Over there !

630
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.120
There's one other!

631
01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.680
It is!

632
01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.640
Kill him !

633
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.840
Kill him, damn!

634
01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.000
Tire !

635
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.200
There's no boat.

636
01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.400
It was that lying.

637
01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.200
He said he lived in a villa.

638
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.400
It was in his head, all that.

639
01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720
It will be fine.

640
01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.240
I'm here.

641
01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.600
Do not worry.

642
01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.000
Stay here.

643
01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.880
His father...

644
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.000
He could not lie.

645
01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.400
It not lying.

646
01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.400
We'll find him, that boat.

647
01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.160
Quick !

648
01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.720
Get in the boat.

649
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.360
We'll push it.

650
01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.280
Monte !

651
01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.000
Started !

652
01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.080
Hurry up !

653
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.280
Non, monte !

654
01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:12.120
Pars !

655
01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.000
It's okay, Pearl.

656
01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.840
Bastian, not!

657
01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.880
I was not gifts.

658
01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.520
Everything I have, 
I managed to get it.

659
01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:27.800
More...

660
01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.360
it will change.

661
01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.000
Everything changes.

662
01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.920
I would like to live in the jungle,

663
01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.600
have a tree house, near a river,

664
01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.400
but it never happens to me nothing cool.

665
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.680
We have two children.

666
01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.960
A boy and a girl.

667
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.160
Ben et Jessica.

668
01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.600
No, wait ...

669
01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.360
Two boys, Ben and Mark.

670
01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.800
I'm still young, the
perfect woman and all that,

671
01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.520
I know, it's something ...

672
01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.080
If it takes me as I am,

673
01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.800
so...

674
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.400
it's okay with me.

675
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.960
My future ?

676
01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.120
I can not see.

677
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
As in fairy tales,

678
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.320
it happens like magic.

679
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.920
Without really knowing ...

680
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.960
we are attracted to each other.

681
01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:37.120
That's all.

682
01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.440
