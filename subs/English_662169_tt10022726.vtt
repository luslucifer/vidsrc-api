00:00:06.017 --> 00:00:10.333
If I hold her hand,
she says don't touch.


2
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.550
If I hold her
foot, she says don't touch.

3
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.550
But when I hold her waist-beads,
she pretends not to know.


4
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.117
Perhaps, down in her heart
Okonkwo, was not a cruel man,


5
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.071
but his whole life was dominated by-

6
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.724
- Are you okay?

7
00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:36.077
- I'm fine.
- Can I get you some water?


8
00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.053
- No, no, no.

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.733
I'm okay.
- It will only take a few seconds.


10
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.223
Are you sure?

11
00:00:43.223 --> 00:00:45.983
- The sound of your voice
is good enough for me.


12
00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:49.717
Okay.

13
00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:52.370
- It is good to know I
still make you blush,


14
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.903
even in my old age.

15
00:00:53.903 --> 00:00:54.920
Yes.

16
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.643
Because you still have your bad boy spark.

17
00:01:02.874 --> 00:01:06.541
- They say a man is
only as old as he feels.


18
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.940
Alright, old man.

19
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.250
Okay.

20
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.800
A man who calls
his kinsmen to a feast

21
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.133
does not do so
to save them from starving.

22
00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:26.100
A man who calls
his kinsmen to a feast


23
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.473
does not do so
to save them from starving.

24
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.343
He protects her.

25
00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.620
Ah!

26
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.250
Oh my God! Who is this animal?!

27
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.933
- Sorry.

28
00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:45.460
- Are you blind?! 
Can't you see?

29
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.380
- Sweetheart, it-

30
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.590
- You've ruined my dress! Can't you-

31
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.410
- So sorry, I mean it.

32
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.090
- Are you crazy? 
Who's your sweetheart?

33
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.700
You were driving like a mad dog,

34
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.500
not minding that actual
people walk on this road!


35
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.950
- I'm sorry.

36
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.800
Let me take you home, so
you can change your clothes.


37
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.480
- Take me home?

38
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.950
- Oh, no, no. Not like that.

39
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.740
I mean to your house.

40
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.920
You can change your clothes,

41
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.760
and I can drop you off to
wherever you were going.


42
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.560
Look like you were going to a party?

43
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.850
Lovely shoes, by the way.

44
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.440
- I can see
you're not only a madman.

45
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.660
You're also a nosy one!

46
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.760
Why don't you just mind
your damn business,


47
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.950
and leave me alone?

48
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.850
- Just trying to help.

49
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.360
- Try to help me? After
you've ruined my dress?


50
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.251
- So feisty.

51
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:29.084
- Why? All these men,

52
00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:31.100
they just feel they
can walk up to women,

53
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.189
and talk to women anyhow they want!

54
00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.372
- Crazy woman.

55
00:02:34.372 --> 00:02:37.040
- It's your mother, and
your sisters that are crazy!


56
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.610
Idiot!

57
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.443
- Lucky for you, I have
a thing for crazy women.


58
00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:45.983
But you alone, is on another level.

59
00:02:45.983 --> 00:02:49.166
- And who wants to have
anything to do with this one?


60
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:49.999
Anuofia.

61
00:02:51.157 --> 00:02:52.453
- See you around.

62
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.733
Bye, beautiful!

63
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.779
- Okay, I'll leave you here for now.

64
00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:25.612
- Okay.

65
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.950
- That'll be okay?

66
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.783
- Sure.

67
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.852
- So when you're done, just
take a taxi to the office.


68
00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:39.887
- Okay.
- Meet me there.


69
00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:40.932
- Alright.

70
00:03:40.932 --> 00:03:41.765
Bye.

71
00:03:47.604 --> 00:03:49.062
What?

72
00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:54.808
- Oh, sorry mom.

73
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.533
- Please, let me help.

74
00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:08.920
- Who are you?

75
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.090
- Tobi?

76
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.740
- What are you doing in my house?

77
00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:17.030
- Tob-

78
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.470
- I said leave my house.

79
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.880
Or else I'll call the police now.

80
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.630
- Darling, it's me.

81
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.137
Let me help you. 
Just let me help-

82
00:04:27.137 --> 00:04:30.423
- Why is Victor sending
strangers to my house? Why?


83
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.750
- Let me help.

84
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.583
It's okay.

85
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.230
Tobi, Tobi.
- Huh?


86
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.462
- Tobi, you feel me.

87
00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:42.978
That's me, your wife.

88
00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:44.498
Nkem.

89
00:04:44.498 --> 00:04:45.331
Please.

90
00:04:46.496 --> 00:04:47.861
Let me help you.

91
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.149
Okay?

92
00:05:13.344 --> 00:05:15.620
- Hello?

93
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.137
Nkem, your mother's on the phone.

94
00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:19.470
She wants to speak with you.

95
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.189
- Thank you.

96
00:05:24.176 --> 00:05:25.009
Hello?

97
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.923
Mama, good afternoon.

98
00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:39.487
What?

99
00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:48.613
papa is ill?

100
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.803
Wow.

101
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.483
Mama, I just sent
you money two weeks ago.

102
00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.353
Okay.

103
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.163
Yes, um.

104
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.073
Next week.

105
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.163
Yes, mom.

106
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.613
Okay.

107
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.290
Please, take good care of papa, please.

108
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.350
Just take care of him.

109
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.183
Watch him.

110
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.710
Mom, I have to go.

111
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.720
I have to go, I'm at work.

112
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.133
I'm attending to a customer.

113
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.430
Amen, amen, amen, mama.

114
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.480
It's okay, it's fine.

115
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.830
Yeah.

116
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.995
Okay, bye bye. I have to go.

117
00:06:40.995 --> 00:06:43.929
Alright.
Okay, mom. Bye bye.


118
00:06:58.007 --> 00:06:59.673
- Good afternoon.
- Yeah.


119
00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:01.180
- Please, I'm looking
for a Miss Nkem Adichie.


120
00:07:02.193 --> 00:07:04.234
- No, no, no, Adichie.

121
00:07:04.234 --> 00:07:06.019
- It's from who?

122
00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:07.463
- Her name is Kemachine.

123
00:07:07.463 --> 00:07:08.296
Yes, I am.

124
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.460
- How many hours will
you let me in for?

125
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.710
Today, you're receiving
calls or receiving gifts.


126
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.450
What's all this?

127
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.470
- I'm so sorry. 
I'll soon be done.

128
00:07:42.948 --> 00:07:43.781
- God.

129
00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:47.372
- Do you want a cold drink?

130
00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:48.752
- Just do my hair.

131
00:07:48.752 --> 00:07:49.585
- Yes.

132
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.205
- Why you following me?

133
00:08:12.205 --> 00:08:15.092
- Hah, I'm following you?

134
00:08:15.092 --> 00:08:17.813
That's a bit extreme, don't
you think, sweetheart?


135
00:08:17.813 --> 00:08:20.100
- Yes, you're right. Very extreme.

136
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.900
And stop calling me your sweetheart.

137
00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:26.850
- Not bad to admire a beautiful
lady such as yourself.


138
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.900
- Keep your admiration to yourself.

139
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.312
And if you keep weirdly insinuating stuff,

140
00:08:30.312 --> 00:08:32.683
I'll be forced to
report you to your wife.

141
00:08:32.683 --> 00:08:33.890
- What wife?

142
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.346
- Yes, your wife,
and I'm not even joking.

143
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.163
- What's funny?

144
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.487
- You are funny. I try
to think you are funny.


145
00:08:45.487 --> 00:08:46.470
- I'm funny?
- Yes.


146
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.933
- So I look a clown?

147
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.530
You know, just stop fooling
yourself, you married man.


148
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.511
- First of all, 
I'm not married.

149
00:08:56.511 --> 00:08:57.344
- Mm.

150
00:08:58.305 --> 00:08:59.138
- Also-

151
00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:00.853
- Whatever. Your girlfriend, then.

152
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.316
- She's my sister.

153
00:09:03.316 --> 00:09:06.149
- hmm. Brother with a cute sister?

154
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.770
- Let's have dinner together.

155
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.493
- Not even in your next life.

156
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.740
- Madam, it's not what you think.

157
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.220
I don't have anything with your husband.

158
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.710
I was even going to tell you.

159
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.100
- We're not married!

160
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.310
- Oh. I'm sorry. 
I mean your boyfriend.

161
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.640
- He's not my boyfriend, either!

162
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.473
That's my brother.

163
00:09:36.473 --> 00:09:37.443
My elder brother.

164
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.380
I have never seen him
so crazy about a girl,


165
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.350
the way he's been with you.

166
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.953
I mean, I'm here talking to
you, because he asked me to.


167
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.460
I hope it's worth it, though.

168
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.670
- How do you mean?

169
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.610
- I'm sorry, that came out wrong.

170
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.170
My brother put me up to, you know,

171
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.430
convince you to have dinner with him.

172
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.700
- As you can see, I'm at work.

173
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.920
My customers are waiting
for me. I have to go.


174
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.133
- I understand, but have
dinner with my brother.


175
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.440
Give him a chance.

176
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.273
It won't hurt.

177
00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:13.175
- Okay, I'll think about it.

178
00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:14.739
- Okay, thank you.

179
00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:15.572
- Alright.

180
00:10:15.572 --> 00:10:16.453
- Okay, bye.

181
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.920
- So, tell me about your family.

182
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.013
- Well, that's a very interesting topic.

183
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.783
- How do you mean?

184
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.343
- Well, I only got to
know my mom recently.


185
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.653
- Oh.

186
00:10:48.653 --> 00:10:51.870
- I grew up with
my father, my step mom,

187
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.154
and my sister, whom you've already met.

188
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.126
Interesting personality.

189
00:10:58.126 --> 00:10:59.503
- Yes, that's true.

190
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.794
Actually, I don't know if she
ever wanted to get to know me.


191
00:11:07.794 --> 00:11:09.825
I mean my mom.

192
00:11:09.825 --> 00:11:10.658
- Oh.

193
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.820
- And, her family isn't actually here.

194
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.550
I was born and raised in London,

195
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.393
and I only came to Nigeria
after school, to work.


196
00:11:25.498 --> 00:11:27.200
- I'm sorry about your mom.

197
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.033
- Thank.

198
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.623
My step mom is actually awesome.

199
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.780
- Oh.

200
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.020
- It's actually funny, me
calling her my step mom,


201
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.330
'cause I've known her
as my mom all my life.


202
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.220
- You don't have to change what
you're used to calling her.


203
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.053
- That's right.

204
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.063
That's true.

205
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.190
Well, what about you?

206
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.473
What's your family like?

207
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.883
- Well, there's my father,

208
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.720
there's my mother,

209
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.963
and my two sisters, who are married.

210
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.631
They all live in Enugu.

211
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:16.179
I moved in here for work.

212
00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:17.012
- Okay.

213
00:12:18.909 --> 00:12:19.742
- Okay.

214
00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:30.972
- Let me play some music.

215
00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:32.818
- Okay.

216
00:13:56.297 --> 00:13:57.520
You're early.

217
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.110
- Yes.

218
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.370
I wanted to show you something.

219
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.790
Hop in.

220
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:02.690
- What's that?

221
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.400
- Well, you have to come in,

222
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.440
so I can take
you there and show you.

223
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.483
It's a surprise.

224
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.345
- Okay, big boy,
let me get my purse.

225
00:14:10.345 --> 00:14:11.992
- Okay.

226
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.313
- Tobi, this is amazing!

227
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.993
- Yes, I knew you'd like it.

228
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.570
- I don't like it, I love it.

229
00:15:08.838 --> 00:15:12.338
- Well, I'm glad you love it.

230
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.573
You deserve the very best.

231
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.503
I love you, Nkem Adichie.

232
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.513
Marry me.

233
00:15:31.332 --> 00:15:32.165
- What?

234
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.430
- I feel like I've
known you all my life,

235
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.153
and if I can get the kind of
goosebumps I get from you,


236
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.350
and this feeling of being on cloud nine

237
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.750
just from being with you.

238
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.080
I wonder how I would feel

239
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.717
if I were yours, and you were mine.

240
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.563
- Nkem, it's not a joke.
My knees are hurting.


241
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.630
Wouldn't it be the perfect crime

242
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.556
if I were yours, and you were mine?

243
00:16:25.282 --> 00:16:26.794
Okay! Yes.

244
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.140
- And that's because you're a getting

245
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.466
lame with your pick up lines.

246
00:16:40.466 --> 00:16:41.816
- How dare you!

247
00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:44.158
- Do you know how many
romantic novels I had to read


248
00:16:44.158 --> 00:16:45.563
just to get those lines?

249
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.610
- You had to read romantic
books to propose to me?


250
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.443
- Why not?

251
00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:51.328
- Okay, I don't want your ring anymore.

252
00:16:51.328 --> 00:16:52.987
You can have it back.

253
00:16:52.987 --> 00:16:54.333
- I'm just joking.

254
00:16:55.699 --> 00:16:57.116
I love you, baby.

255
00:16:58.238 --> 00:17:00.905
- I love you, too.
- I love you.


256
00:17:02.634 --> 00:17:03.660
Okay.

257
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.493
Now.

258
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.420
Let's take a picture.

259
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.253
- Okay.

260
00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:20.903
- I like to
listen to your heart beat.

261
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.083
- It's beating fast, right?

262
00:20:25.083 --> 00:20:25.916
- Mmhmm.

263
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.320
- You know, there's
nothing I've wanted more


264
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.063
than to make you feel safe.

265
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.483
- I feel safe in your arms.

266
00:20:56.547 --> 00:20:59.323
- Babe, you should eat
before you go to work.


267
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.841
- Sweetheart, you know
the honeymoon is over.


268
00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:05.674
Hmm?

269
00:21:05.674 --> 00:21:07.430
I have to work.

270
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:08.670
So I can take care of you,

271
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.980
so I can give you anything you need.

272
00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.093
- I feel weird being alone by
myself while you're at work.


273
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.650
- It's okay, I won't be long.

274
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.483
- Promise?

275
00:21:19.483 --> 00:21:20.780
- I promise.

276
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.613
- Okay.

277
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.110
- I love you, too.

278
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.730
- You can't keep doing this to yourself.

279
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.730
He needs to be somewhere
he can be handled.


280
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.210
- Hmm.

281
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.113
Handled?

282
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:51.130
My husband is a sick
man, and not a monster.


283
00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.343
Nobody can take care
of him like I'll do.

284
00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.750
And, I'm not complaining.

285
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.833
- Look, I totally understand.

286
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.613
But you're not fit enough for this.

287
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.163
Look, you look totally exhausted.

288
00:22:16.598 --> 00:22:18.193
- I'll be fine.

289
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.143
There's nothing I'll rather do.

290
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.043
He has his good and bad days,

291
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.870
but that's good enough for me.

292
00:22:34.835 --> 00:22:37.913
- It's really hard to
see you suffer like this.


293
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.610
There's this place I found,

294
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.300
their facilities are great.

295
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.150
They take good care of their patient.

296
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:51.033
Look, he doesn't even
recognize you any longer.


297
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:53.463
- I know.

298
00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.803
But nobody knows him better than I do.

299
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.433
He's my husband.

300
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:03.663
I'll take care of him.

301
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.193
Okay?

302
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:12.940
See, the last time we took
him to one of those homes,


303
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.873
it even became worse.

304
00:23:16.406 --> 00:23:19.700
I am not going
to take that risk anymore.

305
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.303
Leaving my husband in
the hands of strangers?


306
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.453
Nobody would take care
of Tobi like I'll do.


307
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.003
See,

308
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.880
falling in love isn't just euphoric.

309
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.995
Yes, it's a deliberate choice,

310
00:23:41.995 --> 00:23:45.540
and that's the choice
I made with my husband.


311
00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.347
A long time ago.

312
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.143
No matter what, I love Tobi.

313
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.240
I love Tobi, even in his worst days.

314
00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.167
I love him.

315
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.245
- Tobi.

316
00:25:02.245 --> 00:25:03.745
- Yes, sweetheart?

317
00:25:04.697 --> 00:25:06.943
- I need to
talk to you about something.

318
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.963
- Spill.

319
00:25:13.634 --> 00:25:15.393
- This idleness is killing me.

320
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.470
You know, just being here by myself.

321
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.763
I'm doing nothing.

322
00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.233
I'll like to start my
own hairstyling business.


323
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.090
- Baby, we've spoken about this before.

324
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.480
My income is enough to take
care of the both of us.


325
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.260
You don't have to worry.

326
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.510
- It's not about the money.

327
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.233
I just need to get busy
with something productive.


328
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.683
- So taking care of me
is no longer productive?


329
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.290
Ouch.

330
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.473
- Tobi, I'm serious.

331
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.953
- Baby, why don't you just
focus on having a baby instead?


332
00:25:58.704 --> 00:26:00.130
- What?

333
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.380
What do you mean by that?

334
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.000
I can't believe you
just said that to me.

335
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.240
Do you know how it feels

336
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.420
being by myself all day worrying about us?

337
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.293
This.

338
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:14.953
Wow.

339
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.140
We have sex literally every night.

340
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.366
I'm on a healthy
diet, you are aware of.

341
00:26:22.366 --> 00:26:25.070
And you say this to me?

342
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.312
- Don't take it like that.

343
00:26:26.312 --> 00:26:29.062
I really didn't mean it that way.

344
00:26:30.302 --> 00:26:31.135
Nkem.

345
00:27:10.983 --> 00:27:12.233
- Who is there?

346
00:27:15.862 --> 00:27:16.695
- Mama!

347
00:27:21.329 --> 00:27:24.767
- Nkem! Hey, I was looking,
I thought you deserted.


348
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.110
- Hey, how are you?

349
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:31.479
- I'm fine, mama, 
I'm very fine.

350
00:27:31.479 --> 00:27:32.810
How are you, and how's the journey?

351
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.870
- Johnny was okay and smooth.

352
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:35.870
- Okay, okay.

353
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.020
- You're looking good!

354
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.150
- Thank you, mama.
- Tobi is really taking care of you.


355
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.983
- Yes, he is.

356
00:27:39.983 --> 00:27:41.138
- By the way, where is he?

357
00:27:41.138 --> 00:27:42.790
- He's at work.

358
00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.160
How's papa?

359
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.273
- Your father is fine.

360
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.750
- Mama, I noticed your bag is smaller.

361
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.000
Very small, are you not staying long?

362
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.070
- No, I have
few days to say here.

363
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.633
You know, your dad, he can't
go see me outside here.


364
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:00.473
- Oh papa.

365
00:28:00.473 --> 00:28:02.130
You will last through your big baby love.

366
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.390
You must stay for at least two weeks.

367
00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.820
Come on, sit down.

368
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.653
Sit down.

369
00:28:11.967 --> 00:28:13.230
On a serious note,

370
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:17.683
I have something very
important to discuss with you.


371
00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.237
- Okay, mama, what's the problem?

372
00:28:20.237 --> 00:28:21.163
- Don't worry.
- Is everything okay?


373
00:28:21.163 --> 00:28:23.569
- Everything is fine. Relax.
- Is papa okay?


374
00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:25.053
- Is he fine?
- Your father is okay.


375
00:28:26.843 --> 00:28:27.930
- Okay, so what do
you want to tell me?

376
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.560
- Hey, Nkem, you have changed, too.

377
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.260
What is your problem?

378
00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.750
Can't you offer me something?

379
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.080
- Mom, what would you like to eat?

380
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.550
Do you want us make your favorite?

381
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.399
Hmm?

382
00:28:38.399 --> 00:28:39.232
stop!

383
00:28:39.232 --> 00:28:41.142
Water! Water first.

384
00:28:41.142 --> 00:28:43.766
- Okay, after your water, hmm?

385
00:28:43.766 --> 00:28:44.910
- Because you are married to a Yoruba,

386
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:46.750
you don't know customs of
tradition for farm life.


387
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.950
- Hmm, mama, you started.
You started again.


388
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.173
What are you doing to your
skin? You're looking fine.


389
00:28:54.173 --> 00:28:56.320
Nkem!

390
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.110
Nkem, I'm blushing.

391
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.884
Go, go, go. Go and get
water first. I'm thirsty.


392
00:29:00.884 --> 00:29:04.013
- Okay mama, I'll get your water.

393
00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.457
- You know, this township food.

394
00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.370
It's been long.

395
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.140
What's the difference between

396
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.110
- There is, though, see how it's smelling?

397
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.943
I like it, though.

398
00:29:15.943 --> 00:29:18.370
Ah, doesn't matter.

399
00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.010
Even the aroma is enough, Em.

400
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.267
They always say that
Yoruba stew,


401
00:29:24.267 --> 00:29:26.250
and soup, is pepe, pepe,

402
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.523
but there's no pepe in this one.

403
00:29:27.523 --> 00:29:29.287
- Yeah, I didn't put so much pepper.

404
00:29:29.287 --> 00:29:30.202
- Hmm.

405
00:29:30.202 --> 00:29:32.102
- We still have the oil taste, though.

406
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.693
- Exactly.

407
00:29:34.693 --> 00:29:35.730
It's fine, though.

408
00:29:38.582 --> 00:29:39.499
- Ah, mama.

409
00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.053
Good evening.
- Mmm, welcome.


410
00:29:47.405 --> 00:29:48.993
How is work?

411
00:29:48.993 --> 00:29:51.520
- Very well.
- I thought so, phew.


412
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.300
- Well, I didn't know
you were coming today.


413
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.063
- I told you she was coming today.

414
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.400
Yes, it's just the
dates that I've forgotten about.


415
00:30:02.963 --> 00:30:05.753
But it's still very good to see
you, ma, you look beautiful.


416
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:08.690
- Okay, my son, welcome.

417
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.563
Such a pleasant young man.

418
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.283
What's happened?

419
00:30:22.057 --> 00:30:23.673
- Mama, how do you mean?

420
00:30:24.544 --> 00:30:25.377
- What I mean?

421
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.913
I saw everything. 
I'm not a baby.

422
00:30:29.847 --> 00:30:33.217
What happened between two of you?

423
00:30:33.217 --> 00:30:34.717
- Nothing. Everything is fine.

424
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.460
- Nkem, let everything fine, okay?

425
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.390
Because it is very, very difficult.

426
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:48.250
Very, very hard to get a good man

427
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.373
like this.

428
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.700
Are you getting me?

429
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.730
Good people are hard to get.

430
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.003
Especially such.

431
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.816
See my armpit?

432
00:31:06.538 --> 00:31:08.520
I like him, and I love
him, you accepted him.


433
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.410
I don't want that sullied.

434
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.637
Because.

435
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.883
Whatever that is the case,
go and sort it out with him.


436
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.890
This food, dear, will it be okay?

437
00:31:26.296 --> 00:31:27.314
Hmm?

438
00:31:38.713 --> 00:31:39.546
- Nkem.

439
00:31:43.846 --> 00:31:46.549
If I tell you that I'm not worried,

440
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:48.830
it means I'm a liar.

441
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.143
- Mama, what's wrong?

442
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.246
- Even though you and your husband

443
00:31:55.246 --> 00:32:00.246
have been acting as if all
this were, when it is obvious.


444
00:32:02.123 --> 00:32:02.956
It's not.

445
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:08.573
I can see the stress lie
on your husband's forehead.


446
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.313
And you, too, are not happy.

447
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:19.107
That is why I.

448
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.013
- What?

449
00:32:22.013 --> 00:32:23.679
- Take it!
- Ojima, the herbalist?


450
00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:24.512
- Yes.

451
00:32:25.889 --> 00:32:26.722
Take it.

452
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.310
Drink it.

453
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.430
First thing in the morning,

454
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.620
and last thing at night

455
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.533
before making love to your husband.

456
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:42.300
He assured me that it will
not take up to one month.


457
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.963
You will conceive, and
have your own child.


458
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.293
It works.

459
00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:52.393
Mama, I don't want.

460
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.173
How am I sure
what this is made of?

461
00:32:56.173 --> 00:32:57.790
I can't take this, 
I can't drink it.

462
00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.384
- There is nothing wrong
with nature, perhaps.


463
00:33:01.384 --> 00:33:02.960
I am your mother.

464
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.363
I can not give you anything
that will harm you.


465
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.510
This medicine has been working

466
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.620
for many women in the village.

467
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.657
See, you know Oneika?

468
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.880
This is the medicine she took,

469
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.803
and conceived her last child, Nneka.

470
00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.143
It works! You will have your child.

471
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.790
Eh? You don't want to make me happy?

472
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.830
And you two will be happy.

473
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.110
Oh, I can't wait to see my grandchildren!

474
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.057
Running around me.

475
00:33:38.992 --> 00:33:41.370
Good.
- Okay, mama, okay.


476
00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:43.000
- That's my child.

477
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.197
Go now, take it now.

478
00:33:44.197 --> 00:33:46.280
And go out, meet your husband.

479
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.023
- Mama, he's already asleep.

480
00:33:48.023 --> 00:33:51.283
- Uzuama said that immediately,
meet your husband, bam!


481
00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.596
- Mama, he's asleep.
He's tired from working.


482
00:33:57.596 --> 00:33:58.707
- Eh?

483
00:33:58.707 --> 00:34:00.031
- Yes, and besides, 
I need to sleep.

484
00:34:00.031 --> 00:34:03.150
I'm tired, and it's already late.

485
00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.333
- Are you telling me
you are not taking the-


486
00:34:06.776 --> 00:34:08.410
- Mama, I'm tired, 
I want to sleep.

487
00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:09.243
- Come.

488
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.373
Good night, yeah?

489
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.453
Come, drink it.

490
00:34:27.467 --> 00:34:28.550
It will work.

491
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:36.336
- Thank you, my son.

492
00:34:40.086 --> 00:34:43.459
- Mama, I wish you stayed longer.

493
00:34:43.459 --> 00:34:45.672
- Me too, my daughter.

494
00:34:45.672 --> 00:34:49.830
But, I have to go
and be with my husband.

495
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.295
I'm sure he must be missing me now.

496
00:34:52.295 --> 00:34:53.403
- Mmm?
- Mmm.


497
00:34:53.403 --> 00:34:54.526
- Mmm. Yes now.

498
00:34:56.176 --> 00:34:57.530
The most important thing

499
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.890
is that I have come, and I
came, and did the needful.


500
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:01.723
- Yes, mama.

501
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:05.670
- Remember, first thing in the morning,

502
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.260
last thing in the night before
sleeping with your husband.


503
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.230
Mmm!

504
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:15.657
Pick my this thing for me.

505
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.273
Ah, my son, I'm coming.

506
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.850
So, let me rush now.

507
00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.580
I don't want to start
looking at your face now.


508
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.594
Let me go, so that
I don't miss the bus.

509
00:35:27.594 --> 00:35:29.925
- Mama, I'll miss you.

510
00:35:29.925 --> 00:35:31.092
- I know that.

511
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.143
Let me go.

512
00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:18.204
- Baby.

513
00:36:23.002 --> 00:36:26.110
You're vomiting everyday
for the past three days.


514
00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.100
- Yeah.
- It is a sign.


515
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.383
- And I missed my period.

516
00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:32.932
I think-

517
00:36:32.932 --> 00:36:34.187
- We're pregnant!

518
00:36:34.187 --> 00:36:36.493
Oh my God! Yes!

519
00:36:37.477 --> 00:36:38.543
I'm going to be a father!

520
00:36:38.543 --> 00:36:39.981
- Yes, you are!

521
00:36:39.981 --> 00:36:41.175
- Yes!

522
00:36:41.175 --> 00:36:42.770
- Wait, we have to go to
the hospital to confirm it.


523
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.730
- Right now, we are going.

524
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.943
- Okay. No, wait, what about work?

525
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.533
- Look, I don't
care about that right now.

526
00:36:51.533 --> 00:36:52.366
- Okay!

527
00:36:52.366 --> 00:36:53.391
- The guys have the sight
to sort their problems.


528
00:36:53.391 --> 00:36:54.224
Let's go.

529
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.317
- Baby, please stop crying.

530
00:37:02.165 --> 00:37:03.520
- No.

531
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.601
I'm so ashamed of myself, and sad.

532
00:37:06.601 --> 00:37:07.552
- Ashamed?

533
00:37:07.552 --> 00:37:08.385
- Yes.

534
00:37:08.385 --> 00:37:09.690
- Why should you be ashamed?

535
00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.310
- I've failed you countless times.

536
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.740
I know how much you want a child.

537
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.180
I saw your face light up

538
00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:19.503
when you thought I was
pregnant this morning.


539
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.820
And I saw your eyes fall

540
00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.369
when we got the pregnancy test results.

541
00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:26.765
- We just have to try again.

542
00:37:26.765 --> 00:37:27.598
- No.

543
00:37:27.598 --> 00:37:28.480
- Just keep trying.

544
00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.000
- It's not okay.

545
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.393
I'm wasting your time.

546
00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.130
I think there's something wrong with me.

547
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:36.780
- There's nothing wrong with you.

548
00:37:39.228 --> 00:37:40.173
I love you, Nkem.

549
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.943
I'm content with you.

550
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.210
Of course, I would love the idea

551
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:48.043
of having children with you,

552
00:37:48.043 --> 00:37:51.616
so I can see little versions
of you running around.


553
00:37:51.616 --> 00:37:53.716
But, seeing your beautiful face every day?

554
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.580
It's enough for me.

555
00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.050
Look, if there was a choice

556
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.903
between you and having kids,

557
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.750
you'll win every time.

558
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.033
No questions.

559
00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:11.990
- I'm sorry.

560
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.630
I mean, I thought I was pregnant.

561
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:18.030
I missed my period, 
I was throwing up.

562
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.223
- It's the stress.

563
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.500
All you have to do

564
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.157
stop worrying, and just rest now.

565
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.203
That's all.

566
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.394
Promise.

567
00:38:29.394 --> 00:38:30.227
- You promise?

568
00:38:30.227 --> 00:38:31.227
- I promise.

569
00:39:18.001 --> 00:39:18.834
- Baby?

570
00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:23.290
Nkem?

571
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:24.980
- Yes, babe?

572
00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.003
- Come, come, come.

573
00:39:31.159 --> 00:39:31.992
Hello.

574
00:39:31.992 --> 00:39:33.658
- Hey, you're back from work early.
- Yes, I am.


575
00:39:33.658 --> 00:39:34.887
How are you?

576
00:39:34.887 --> 00:39:36.120
- I'm okay.

577
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.320
- Okay, you know what I
want you to do right now?


578
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.153
- What?

579
00:39:39.153 --> 00:39:40.280
- Go and pack your bag.

580
00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.588
I'm taking you on a road trip.

581
00:39:42.588 --> 00:39:43.663
- Why didn't you tell me?

582
00:39:43.663 --> 00:39:46.570
- That's why it's a surprise, my love.

583
00:39:47.403 --> 00:39:48.236
Let's go.

584
00:39:48.236 --> 00:39:50.380
- But I'm cooking something
that's not ready yet.


585
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.000
- Don't worry about that,
just put it in the fridge.


586
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.084
Come on, come on, come on.

587
00:39:54.084 --> 00:39:55.475
Let's go, let's go.

588
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.390
- It's the same place!

589
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.453
- Yes, my love.

590
00:40:14.677 --> 00:40:15.760
- Awe, Tobes!

591
00:40:17.337 --> 00:40:19.199
- Tobes? That's actually the first time

592
00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:20.220
you've called me that.

593
00:40:21.483 --> 00:40:23.780
This is beautiful.

594
00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.068
Thank you so much.

595
00:40:25.068 --> 00:40:26.590
- You're welcome.

596
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.143
- You're going to make my cry.

597
00:40:40.432 --> 00:40:43.145
You always know how to lighten my mood.

598
00:40:43.145 --> 00:40:45.370
- Yes, I do.

599
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:46.768
- You're my superman.

600
00:40:46.768 --> 00:40:47.809
- Yes.

601
00:41:14.651 --> 00:41:15.501
Oh, wow.

602
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.193
Is something wrong?

603
00:41:55.792 --> 00:41:58.123
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean for this to happen.


604
00:41:58.123 --> 00:41:59.143
- It's okay.

605
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:04.820
You know, you look sexy when
you're stressed and tired.


606
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.350
I mean, I don't get to
see you like this often.


607
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:10.613
You act like this superhuman
that nothing gets to.


608
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.610
It's nice seeing you like this.

609
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.493
- Well, you know, I enjoy
being your superman.


610
00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:19.953
- And I'm your kryptonite.

611
00:42:21.942 --> 00:42:23.608
- Yes, you are.
- Yes.


612
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.573
- That was nice.

613
00:42:45.442 --> 00:42:49.630
I think we should
have more spontaneous sex.


614
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.583
- Agreed.

615
00:42:50.583 --> 00:42:53.223
Definitely.

616
00:42:55.217 --> 00:42:57.153
- It's really getting late.

617
00:42:57.153 --> 00:42:59.050
What are we going to do?

618
00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:03.150
- Well, we should try
and flag down a vehicle.


619
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.983
- Okay.

620
00:43:03.983 --> 00:43:05.880
I think I should
do it this time, though.

621
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.713
- You?

622
00:43:06.713 --> 00:43:07.546
- Yes.

623
00:43:07.546 --> 00:43:08.379
- Are you sure?

624
00:43:08.379 --> 00:43:09.212
- Watch me.

625
00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:14.632
- Careful.

626
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:49.703
Why?

627
00:43:49.703 --> 00:43:51.453
What's wrong? Don't do that.

628
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:55.390
What's wrong? You don't like it?

629
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.453
Just one more.

630
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:00.903
Okay.

631
00:44:02.741 --> 00:44:04.341
Maybe I should make another one.

632
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.063
Perhaps, it's a bit cold.

633
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:12.063
I'm coming.

634
00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.550
Okay.

635
00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.150
Try this.

636
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:42.693
I'm sure you will like this.

637
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.063
Now, it's a bit hot.

638
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:53.443
Tobi, please.

639
00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:55.203
Please.

640
00:45:35.929 --> 00:45:37.596
- You're burning up.

641
00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:40.760
Okay, come and get dressed.

642
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.480
Let me take you to the hospital.

643
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.760
- No, it's not that serious.

644
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.263
It's just fever.

645
00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.600
I just need to take a cold
bath, and painkillers.


646
00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.720
I'll be fine.

647
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.260
- No, I don't like it
when you self medicate.


648
00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.525
- Tobi, it's not that serious.

649
00:45:56.525 --> 00:45:57.358
I'm fine.

650
00:45:58.587 --> 00:45:59.670
- I hear you.

651
00:46:01.807 --> 00:46:04.086
Okay, let me give you a shower.

652
00:46:04.086 --> 00:46:06.378
- Okay.
- At least.


653
00:46:06.378 --> 00:46:07.956
Okay.

654
00:46:07.956 --> 00:46:08.944
Let's go.

655
00:46:08.944 --> 00:46:10.465
- Carry me.

656
00:46:10.465 --> 00:46:14.048
You are a baby.

657
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:28.763
- Awe!

658
00:46:30.875 --> 00:46:32.795
- Good morning, baby girl.

659
00:46:32.795 --> 00:46:33.824
- Thank you.

660
00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:35.241
- You're welcome.

661
00:46:51.313 --> 00:46:52.564
Thanks, baby.

662
00:46:52.564 --> 00:46:53.397
- Welcome.

663
00:47:07.613 --> 00:47:08.446
- What?

664
00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.439
Why you looking at me like that?

665
00:47:11.439 --> 00:47:12.522
- Look, Nkem,

666
00:47:13.677 --> 00:47:15.793
and don't take this the wrong way, but,

667
00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.550
you look a little chubby.

668
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.900
- Are you saying that I'm fat?

669
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:25.050
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

670
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:29.143
I'm just saying, your
cheeks are filled out a bit.


671
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:32.510
- Well, I have chubby cheeks.

672
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:33.853
- Well, yeah.

673
00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.670
- Yeah?

674
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.578
So, I have chubby cheeks?

675
00:47:38.578 --> 00:47:39.411
Is that what you're saying?

676
00:47:39.411 --> 00:47:42.070
You have already
said it yourself, now!


677
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.320
- You're not supposed to say that.

678
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.153
You're supposed to say

679
00:47:44.153 --> 00:47:47.210
no, baby, you have a natural contort face.

680
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:48.313
- Why you holding your face like that?

681
00:47:48.313 --> 00:47:50.327
- I was just being theatrical.

682
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.000
My own marital strength.

683
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.833
- Yes.

684
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.550
- And I love your chubby cheeks.

685
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.233
Baby, on a serious note.

686
00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.670
We should go to the hospital.

687
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.400
Just to check you out, huh?

688
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.650
Know for sure what's wrong with
you, and just stop assuming.


689
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.240
- So, what are you insinuating?

690
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.423
- Hi.

691
00:50:28.657 --> 00:50:29.990
Can you hear me?

692
00:50:31.506 --> 00:50:33.760
You can hear me? Okay.

693
00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.593
Um,

694
00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:37.363
I can't wait to meet you.

695
00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.943
Your daddy's so excited to meet you.

696
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:48.440
We are going for this
thing called ultrasound.


697
00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:53.050
It's like camera that shows
inside of your stomach.


698
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:56.110
And we're going to see
your beautiful face,


699
00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:58.803
and see if you're
a girl or a boy.

700
00:51:00.335 --> 00:51:01.793
But, I'm certain you're a boy.

701
00:51:01.793 --> 00:51:04.110
I don't know, 'cause
I can feel you inside,


702
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.310
and I just know you're a boy somehow.

703
00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:08.990
Even though your dad
thinks that you're a girl.


704
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:10.530
I think he's wrong.

705
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.220
So, tomorrow, when we see you,

706
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.020
your dad will see that you're a boy.

707
00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:17.947
I don't even know
what to say to you.

708
00:51:17.947 --> 00:51:20.563
I'm so nervous, I can't
just wait to meet you.


709
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:24.230
I love you so much.

710
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:25.810
I will give you everything.

711
00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:27.833
Everything could ask for.

712
00:51:27.833 --> 00:51:29.803
I love you with all my heart.

713
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:33.910
And your daddy loves you, too.

714
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.833
We both love you, and
can't wait to meet you.


715
00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:50.160
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

716
00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.027
I had to attend to a patient.

717
00:51:53.027 --> 00:51:54.130
It's okay, doctor.

718
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:57.220
We are just so excited about the baby.

719
00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.070
- I can see that.

720
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:02.053
- So, is it
a boy or a girl?

721
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.233
- It's a boy.

722
00:52:04.233 --> 00:52:05.750
- Yes!

723
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:06.903
I told you! I told you.

724
00:52:07.922 --> 00:52:09.172
- There's something else.

725
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.033
- Um, is something wrong?

726
00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:15.730
- Well, we don't know yet.

727
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.470
The ultrasound detected a fleet

728
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:20.563
at the back of
the neck of the fetus.

729
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.160
We can't conclude anything right now.

730
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.070
There are tests that are carried out

731
00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.913
to test for markers in your blood.

732
00:52:29.117 --> 00:52:33.350
- Um, I'm lost. 
I'm lost here.

733
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.724
- There's really no need to panic now.

734
00:52:35.724 --> 00:52:38.480
I will take blood samples right now.

735
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.190
Run the tests, and you can come back

736
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.930
next week for the results.

737
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.570
- Thank you, doctor.

738
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:44.590
- See you next week.

739
00:52:52.447 --> 00:52:54.050
- The results of the test indicate

740
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:56.525
that your baby has down syndrome.

741
00:52:56.525 --> 00:52:58.108
- What?

742
00:52:58.108 --> 00:52:59.690
How?

743
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:02.170
What could be the cause of this?

744
00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.730
- It's a simple case
of a genetic disorder.


745
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:07.290
I know this is difficult to handle.

746
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:09.020
We could terminate the
pregnancy, if you like.


747
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.034
- No!
- That will never happen.


748
00:53:11.034 --> 00:53:12.330
- No!

749
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:14.173
- Okay, well, you do know the challenge

750
00:53:14.173 --> 00:53:15.990
that may arise as a result of trying

751
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:18.240
to raise up a child with down syndrome.

752
00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.060
A year of wait may cause
intellectual impairments,


753
00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:23.180
and physical abnormalities.

754
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:31.650
- Thank you.

755
00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.010
- What do you think about Shango?

756
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:51.363
It's a strong name. 
Strong Yoruba name.

757
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:57.770
Or maybe something Biblical,
like one of those big names.


758
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:58.603
David!

759
00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:00.483
Or Solomon!

760
00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:13.193
- I have decided to
terminate the pregnancy.


761
00:54:24.893 --> 00:54:26.310
- You're serious?

762
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:31.980
You're really not joking right now?

763
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.083
Oh, Nkem. You have to think
about that more seriously.


764
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.643
- I have made up my mind.

765
00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.993
- But he's my baby, too.

766
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.450
- I do not
want to create a child

767
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:55.163
that isn't going to
have much of a future.

768
00:54:56.710 --> 00:55:00.933
He wouldn't grow up to drive, get married.

769
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:05.223
Schooling will be extremely
difficult for him.


770
00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:10.853
No one deserves that kind of life.

771
00:55:10.853 --> 00:55:14.110
He wouldn't get to do the things

772
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:16.063
we all have a fair share to do.

773
00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.803
Tobi, I am heartbroken for him.

774
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.393
Please,

775
00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:29.785
I can't bear the mental torture.

776
00:55:29.785 --> 00:55:30.618
I can't!

777
00:55:30.618 --> 00:55:32.010
- Look, you have no right

778
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:35.650
to decide what's right
for somebody else's life.


779
00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:37.178
Okay?

780
00:55:37.178 --> 00:55:39.195
- I'm his mother!

781
00:55:39.195 --> 00:55:40.203
- You are not God.

782
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:43.300
- I'm his mother.

783
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.290
You can't tell me that! 
I'm his mother!

784
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.552
I cannot bring him into this
world in this condition!


785
00:55:51.552 --> 00:55:53.190
I can't!

786
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.500
Not this world!

787
00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:56.047
Tobi, you know it.

788
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:05.513
- Nkem, I'm his father,

789
00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.550
and I have a
say in this thing, too.

790
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:10.280
You can't just do that.

791
00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:11.940
- No.

792
00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.710
Don't tell me that.

793
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:14.820
Don't.

794
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.330
Do you know how many nights

795
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:20.453
I cried myself to sleep all these years?

796
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.813
Because of the struggle to get pregnant!

797
00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:27.787
And I finally get pregnant.

798
00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.513
Do you know devastating that is?

799
00:56:53.476 --> 00:56:54.309
- Nkem,

800
00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:58.993
you keep saying I,

801
00:56:58.993 --> 00:57:01.303
as if you're the only
person in this situation.


802
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:06.423
I'm effected by this, as well.

803
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:10.700
No matter how you look at it,

804
00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:12.050
this thing affects me, too.

805
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:14.083
I may not be the one

806
00:57:14.083 --> 00:57:17.030
that has to carry this child
in my stomach for nine months,


807
00:57:18.133 --> 00:57:19.383
but I feel the same pain.

808
00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:27.930
And, you can't just take someone's life

809
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:29.230
into your hands like that.

810
00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:32.380
This is a whole life.

811
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.021
A whole destiny.

812
00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.130
- You don't have the right.

813
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:42.090
Baby, we have to think about this.

814
00:57:43.698 --> 00:57:44.531
No.

815
00:57:46.615 --> 00:57:47.448
No.

816
00:57:48.687 --> 00:57:52.560
No!

817
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.797
- Don't give up, baby.

818
00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:56.764
- Shh.

819
00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:00.810
Don't give up.

820
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.890
- No way.

821
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:08.223
- Come on, baby.

822
00:59:40.896 --> 00:59:41.896
- Hey, babe.

823
00:59:43.012 --> 00:59:43.845
- Hey.

824
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:52.703
- What's wrong?

825
00:59:54.015 --> 00:59:54.848
- I'm fine.

826
00:59:57.742 --> 00:59:58.575
- Nkem!

827
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320
What have you done?!

828
01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:09.183
What's this?

829
01:00:13.363 --> 01:00:14.707
- I was going to tell you.

830
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:18.680
- You took our baby out?!

831
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.113
- I couldn't keep it.

832
01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.793
- It? It?!

833
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:28.520
- Tobi.

834
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.853
- How could you?

835
01:00:31.486 --> 01:00:32.319
- Tobi.

836
01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:34.062
Tobi!

837
01:00:48.999 --> 01:00:49.832
Tobi!

838
01:00:51.246 --> 01:00:52.079
Tobi.

839
01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:53.943
Wait.

840
01:00:54.846 --> 01:00:57.333
You can't possibly leave
at this time of the night.


841
01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.393
Tobi.

842
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:19.663
Tobi.

843
01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:23.573
Can we talk?

844
01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:31.573
Tobi, please.

845
01:01:36.757 --> 01:01:39.424
- There's nothing to talk about.

846
01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:41.763
- Tobi.

847
01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.663
- Merry Christmas.

848
01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:07.107
Where have you been?

849
01:02:07.107 --> 01:02:09.260
I've been so worried.

850
01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.060
I thought something happened to you.

851
01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:14.253
You're drunk.

852
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:16.443
Have you been drinking?

853
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:19.503
- So what?

854
01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.173
So what if I'm drunk?

855
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.790
- I can't keep doing this.

856
01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:26.710
In the last four days,

857
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:29.610
you've been coming home
drunk every single night.


858
01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:30.883
- Just leave me alone.

859
01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.310
- It's high time you grow up!

860
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:37.707
How long are you going
to continue like this?!


861
01:02:38.915 --> 01:02:41.257
You're not the only
one grieving, you know!


862
01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.120
Get a grip on yourself, please!

863
01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.143
- How dare you?

864
01:02:46.404 --> 01:02:48.554
Not everybody's as cold
hearted as you are.


865
01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.223
Do not make me lose my temper.

866
01:02:56.545 --> 01:02:58.220
- I'm tired.

867
01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.900
Can we move on already, please?

868
01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.333
- Look, I've held you down.

869
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:08.843
When you cry, when you're
sad, when you're angry.


870
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:13.190
Even when you push me away.

871
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.543
I'm still right there.

872
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:17.920
I've had to bottle up years of pain

873
01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.293
to make you feel good.

874
01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:21.547
And now I have
to worry about the fact

875
01:03:21.547 --> 01:03:23.243
that you don't have kids.

876
01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.063
I've been a good husband to you!

877
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.193
Just one thing.

878
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.131
Just one thing is all
I've ever asked you for,


879
01:03:34.131 --> 01:03:35.183
and you failed!

880
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:42.653
How do you even sleep at
night after what you've done?


881
01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.140
You have no right to take
somebody else's life!


882
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.433
You are not God!

883
01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.270
I can't even recognize
the woman I married.


884
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:58.483
- So

885
01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.993
this is really not about the child.

886
01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:06.723
This is the satisfaction
of you being a father.


887
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.060
And you don't mind being a
father, regardless of anything?


888
01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:11.893
- Yes.

889
01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:14.717
I want a child!

890
01:04:19.365 --> 01:04:20.577
It's been eight years.

891
01:04:20.577 --> 01:04:22.077
Eight years, Nkem!

892
01:04:24.091 --> 01:04:24.924
- Wow.

893
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:30.180
What happened to if it's
between you and having children,


894
01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:31.603
you win all the time?

895
01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:35.233
I guess it was all a lie.

896
01:04:37.259 --> 01:04:39.513
I'm useless without children.

897
01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:41.853
- I guess.

898
01:04:54.119 --> 01:04:57.240
I'll be back to get my things tomorrow.

899
01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.413
I need some space.

900
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:34.970
- Good morning, ma'am.

901
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:36.553
- Good morning Akpan.

902
01:06:36.553 --> 01:06:41.553
- Forgot some enko karin
briefcase, and some a few clothes.


903
01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.550
- His briefcase?

904
01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:44.383
Where is he?

905
01:06:46.214 --> 01:06:47.803
- And, he said
I should give you this.

906
01:07:00.930 --> 01:07:03.740
I'm sorry, madam, please,
I'm in a hurry, ma'am.


907
01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.640
There's a taxi waiting for me outside.

908
01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.033
- Okay.

909
01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:10.380
Let me go get his things.

910
01:07:35.114 --> 01:07:36.103
- Thank you, ma'am.

911
01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:40.503
He also said that
I should give you this.

912
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:46.650
- His car key?

913
01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:48.937
- Yes ma'am. I'll be on my way.

914
01:07:57.583 --> 01:08:00.290
- Dear Nkem, I never thought

915
01:08:00.290 --> 01:08:02.073
I would be writing you this letter.

916
01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.137
There was a time when I thought

917
01:08:04.137 --> 01:08:07.070
our love could stand the test of time,

918
01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:08.913
and nothing could come between us.

919
01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:13.603
To say that I've agonized over
this is an understatement.


920
01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:17.813
This situation is overwhelming for me.

921
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:20.623
I need some time to be away.

922
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.420
I'm in so much pain right now,

923
01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:29.160
that I actually dream
about a time in the future.


924
01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.940
When thinking about what you did

925
01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.633
to our unborn baby won't hurt so much.

926
01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:39.000
I still love you, and
I'll continue to love you,


927
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.973
but it's tearing me apart.

928
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:45.733
You have to let me go, so
I can find myself again.


929
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:50.833
I left some money for you in
the drawers beside the bed.


930
01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.633
It should be enough to
start up a business.


931
01:08:55.964 --> 01:08:57.064
You're a strong woman.

932
01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:59.640
I know you will figure things out.

933
01:09:01.509 --> 01:09:03.210
I cherish our good memories,

934
01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:05.393
and I hope they
always stay on my mind.

935
01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.573
Time and distance will
help heal this wound.


936
01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.993
Love, always, Tobi.

937
01:09:23.668 --> 01:09:25.740
Hey! Be careful!

938
01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:29.002
Do not kick the ball
too hard at your sister!


939
01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:33.560
Can you imagine?

940
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.107
Okay, that's enough!

941
01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:54.291
- Hello.

942
01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.943
- Uncle Tobi!

943
01:12:01.553 --> 01:12:02.962
How are you doing, sir?

944
01:12:02.962 --> 01:12:04.731
- I'm very well.

945
01:12:04.731 --> 01:12:05.630
- It's been a long time.

946
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:06.463
- How are you doing?

947
01:12:06.463 --> 01:12:07.360
- I'm good, too, sir.

948
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.585
- And how's the family?

949
01:12:08.585 --> 01:12:09.948
- Everything good.

950
01:12:09.948 --> 01:12:10.781
We alright.

951
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.380
How's everything, sir?

952
01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.620
- Fine.

953
01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.470
It's been about four years?

954
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:18.303
- Yes, sir.

955
01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.863
- So how is the whole family?

956
01:12:20.863 --> 01:12:23.224
- We've been good, everybody's fine.

957
01:12:23.224 --> 01:12:24.853
- That's great.

958
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:29.853
I just came to check for Nkem,
it seems she's not around?


959
01:12:31.553 --> 01:12:32.783
- Ah, hey, uncle Tobi,

960
01:12:32.783 --> 01:12:36.023
aunt Nkem left here like
four years ago, sir.


961
01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:38.103
Are you not aware?

962
01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:41.293
Don't you come to get with your wife?

963
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:46.793
She told my mother that
you traveled out for work.


964
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.603
- I did, yes, I did.

965
01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:55.580
Okay.

966
01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.413
Thank you.

967
01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:57.290
- Yes, sir.

968
01:12:58.687 --> 01:13:00.950
Uncle Tobi, wait.

969
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:04.130
Sir, the last time my mother saw her,

970
01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:08.083
she say she now owns
an hair salon business.


971
01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:11.830
She even give her her address.

972
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:13.510
Can I get it for you, sir?

973
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:14.343
- Yes.

974
01:13:14.343 --> 01:13:15.176
Yes, please.

975
01:13:15.176 --> 01:13:16.023
- Okay, I get it for you.

976
01:13:16.023 --> 01:13:17.856
Wait here, uncle Tobi.

977
01:13:19.011 --> 01:13:20.011
- Thank you.

978
01:14:39.259 --> 01:14:40.220
- You're still so beautiful.

979
01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:42.010
You haven't aged a day.

980
01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.333
- Tobi, what do you want?

981
01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.150
- I just...

982
01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.873
- He comes back after four years,

983
01:14:58.349 --> 01:15:02.022
and the first thing he does
is try to use his charm on me?


984
01:15:02.022 --> 01:15:03.790
I didn't-
- It's not like-


985
01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:06.140
- I need to refresh, now,
how did we even meet?


986
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:08.383
- Look, I-

987
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:10.655
- Nevermind.

988
01:15:10.655 --> 01:15:12.173
It's your specialty.

989
01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.360
- Look, I'm sorry.

990
01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:20.095
I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what, exactly?


991
01:15:20.095 --> 01:15:22.033
- Look, it wasn't exactly easy for me.

992
01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:24.423
- And it was easy for me?

993
01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.330
- Look, the death of our child

994
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.693
that became the death of me.

995
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:41.550
- You don't have to say it nicely.

996
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:42.763
He didn't just die.

997
01:15:44.055 --> 01:15:45.350
I killed him.

998
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:46.183
- Stop.

999
01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.210
Stop talking like that.

1000
01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:52.430
- Where have you been all these years?

1001
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:53.570
You come back here,

1002
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:55.290
and you tell me sorry?

1003
01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:57.253
Sorry doesn't cut it, Tobi.

1004
01:15:58.330 --> 01:15:59.470
- Look, all this time,

1005
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:00.990
I've just been trying to numb the pain

1006
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:02.390
of everything that happened.

1007
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:05.910
Even thinking of it,

1008
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:07.460
even thinking of what happened.

1009
01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:13.880
I wouldn't have survived all those years.

1010
01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.270
I just needed to get away.

1011
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:16.233
I needed to heal.

1012
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:20.180
I didn't want to come back
here a shattered person.


1013
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:23.333
- Do you hear yourself?

1014
01:16:24.458 --> 01:16:26.373
He was my child, too!

1015
01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:29.903
I mourned his death!

1016
01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.540
How do you think I
survived all these years?


1017
01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.900
- Yes, I know I'm mean,

1018
01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.500
and yes, I am selfish,

1019
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.333
and I'm me.

1020
01:16:50.461 --> 01:16:52.700
But, there's nothing else I can say,

1021
01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:54.313
but I'm sorry.

1022
01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.513
- Sorry?

1023
01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.540
Okay, Tobi, wait, wait.

1024
01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:05.303
Wait, first, where have
you been all these years?


1025
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.580
- What does that matter?

1026
01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.150
- I need to know!

1027
01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:14.332
- Look, I just
needed to get some solace.

1028
01:17:14.332 --> 01:17:16.890
- Where did you go?!

1029
01:17:16.890 --> 01:17:18.627
- I had to go back to London.

1030
01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:20.523
- Wow.

1031
01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.890
How convenient.

1032
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:25.963
- Convenient?

1033
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:31.197
Look, it wasn't as easy as you think.

1034
01:17:31.197 --> 01:17:32.540
- Hmph.

1035
01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.780
- I got into depression.

1036
01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.413
I was becoming a shadow of myself.

1037
01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.153
I didn't want to come back
here a shattered person.


1038
01:17:46.898 --> 01:17:48.148
- You are mean!

1039
01:17:49.397 --> 01:17:51.103
You are wicked, Tobi!

1040
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:54.020
You're so heartless!

1041
01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:56.533
- No, no, come on-
- You are heartless!


1042
01:17:56.533 --> 01:17:57.415
- Please, I'm sorry.

1043
01:17:57.415 --> 01:18:00.215
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1044
01:18:00.215 --> 01:18:02.110
Please, please find a way to-

1045
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:03.402
- You're so wicked!

1046
01:18:03.402 --> 01:18:04.336
So wicked!

1047
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:19.147
- Just accept my apology.

1048
01:18:19.147 --> 01:18:21.994
Accept my apology, please.

1049
01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:22.827
Please.

1050
01:18:31.639 --> 01:18:34.593
- Don't come back here again.

1051
01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.643
I don't want to ever see you.

1052
01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:42.603
- That's too much.

1053
01:18:42.603 --> 01:18:43.436
Nkem!

1054
01:19:10.325 --> 01:19:11.408
- Be careful!

1055
01:19:12.276 --> 01:19:16.998
Do not kick the ball so hard
at your sister!


1056
01:19:16.998 --> 01:19:21.998
- Okay, pass it to me! 
Pass it to me!

1057
01:19:29.283 --> 01:19:30.116
- Tobi?

1058
01:19:31.127 --> 01:19:32.222
Tobi.

1059
01:19:32.222 --> 01:19:33.680
Tobi!

1060
01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.513
Tobi!

1061
01:19:36.412 --> 01:19:38.515
Tobi, no!

1062
01:19:38.515 --> 01:19:39.348
No, Tobi.

1063
01:19:48.879 --> 01:19:49.796
Tobi!

1064
01:20:03.919 --> 01:20:04.752
- Tobi?

1065
01:20:17.757 --> 01:20:18.783
- I'm sorry.

1066
01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:22.253
I'm sorry.

1067
01:20:23.666 --> 01:20:24.499
I'm sorry.

1068
01:20:25.373 --> 01:20:30.373
- I know.

1069
01:20:59.270 --> 01:21:00.370
- Mama, are you ready?

1070
01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:06.570
I'll give you some time.

1071
01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.880
I found this in dad's wardrobe.

1072
01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.713
Here.

1073
01:21:19.699 --> 01:21:22.032
We'll be waiting in the car.

1074
01:21:31.074 --> 01:21:33.350
- Dear Nkem,

1075
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:34.750
I woke up this morning

1076
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:36.943
remembering almost everything.

1077
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:39.980
Everything we shared.

1078
01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.157
Everything we are.

1079
01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.503
I do not know how long
these memories will stay.


1080
01:21:46.636 --> 01:21:48.770
I don't want to wake you up,

1081
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.630
because you look so peaceful

1082
01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:52.480
in your sleep.

1083
01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.897
And I know I've put you
through so much stress.


1084
01:21:54.897 --> 01:21:57.643
And you definitely need this rest.

1085
01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.433
I remember the first time we met.

1086
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:04.813
How feisty you were,

1087
01:22:04.813 --> 01:22:07.513
but you still seemed so genuine.

1088
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:12.373
I had never met anyone as
expressive as you were.


1089
01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:15.953
I loved you since that first day.

1090
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:21.143
Even though we didn't get
together for months after that.


1091
01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.370
I never stopped believing

1092
01:22:24.370 --> 01:22:27.053
that someday, you and I would be.

1093
01:22:28.435 --> 01:22:31.823
I guess that's why I
literally became your stalker.


1094
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:35.233
Nkem, you are my everything.

1095
01:22:36.514 --> 01:22:39.000
And I'm not just saying it.

1096
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.473
I mean every word.

1097
01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:43.399
Thank you for making me feel

1098
01:22:43.399 --> 01:22:46.316
like the luckiest man in the world.

1099
01:22:47.551 --> 01:22:51.240
Thank you for filling our
home with love and happiness,


1100
01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.093
despite all that happened.

1101
01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.993
You helped me regain that part of me

1102
01:22:56.993 --> 01:23:00.013
that I lost when
I was away from you.

1103
01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.643
I thought I could
find myself on my own,

1104
01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:06.453
but I was wrong.

1105
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:12.437
I realized I couldn't
have done it without you.


1106
01:23:12.437 --> 01:23:15.380
You made me realize that there's still

1107
01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:17.583
a lot to live for in this world.

1108
01:23:19.638 --> 01:23:24.020
Oh, and Nkem, thank
you for my son, Victor.


1109
01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:26.090
Thank you for being brave.

1110
01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:29.933
Strong enough to adopt
him, and make him your own.


1111
01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.070
I couldn't help but love him,

1112
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:36.227
because of the way that
I saw that you loved him.


1113
01:23:37.883 --> 01:23:40.403
I've found God for you and Victor.

1114
01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:45.470
You are the best things
that ever happened to me.


1115
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:49.357
You call me your superman,
but the truth is,


1116
01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:52.933
I am not even half as
mentally strong as you are.


1117
01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:58.043
Your level or resilience is incredible.

1118
01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:00.943
You are my superwoman.

1119
01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.370
Thank you for never giving up on me,

1120
01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:08.463
and thank you for loving
me unconditionally.


1121
01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:12.173
I love you deeply, my sweet.

1122
01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:16.863
Oops, I forgot you
hate to be called that.

1123
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:21.963
I love you, my Nkem, my chubby cheeks.

1124
01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.010
Til clouds fade away.

1125
01:24:26.056 --> 01:24:26.973
Your Tobes.
