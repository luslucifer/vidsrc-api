1
00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.657
Cops!

2
00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:12.936
Cops!

3
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:16.463
Julie Barnes. Runaway.
An addict at 18. A fighter.


4
00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:19.306
This little girl
was as hard as they come.


5
00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:36.424
Pete Cochran. A lost cause.
The world's biggest screwup.


6
00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:39.123
He went straight from Beverly Hills
to county jail.


7
00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.849
Lincoln Hayes. He doesn't blame
his crimes on anything.


8
00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:03.581
Had reasons all his own
to burn the world down.


9
00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.398
Easy, man!

10
00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:17.628
Your mother and I have been
worried sick, little girl.


11
00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:20.103
You gonna have to give it up
to Daddy, now. Come on.


12
00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:21.605
Hey! Stop!

13
00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.439
Take this police brutality, baby!

14
00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.275
Out of my way!

15
00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:36.085
All right, I'm gettin' out of here!
Dude, relax.


16
00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:40.114
Get those skinny leather pants
out of here!


17
00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:45.152
Go! You little shit.
You're gonna get caught.


18
00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:52.934
Easy, baby. Why the hackles?

19
00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.854
- How you doin'?
- Okay.


20
00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:18.021
Yeah? Can you hear me?

21
00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:19.688
Okay.

22
00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:25.027
They could've been anybody,
no better or worse than the rest.


23
00:03:25.103 --> 00:03:29.472
Heading for nowhere.
Until I gave them one last chance.


24
00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:50.127
- I'm gonna kill those kids.
- They're mine.


25
00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:53.926
- If anybody does, it's me.
- They're screwing with my men.


26
00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.059
- Is there a problem, fellas?
- No.


27
00:03:57.135 --> 00:03:59.865
- Workin' late again tonight, huh?
- Yeah.


28
00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:03.567
Every night, until we find out who stole
those drugs from the evidence locker.


29
00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.280
- IA.
- They were just doing their job.


30
00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.510
Hello, Los Angeles!

31
00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:15.712
- Adam...
- They didn't volunteer for this job.


32
00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:17.277
- It was my idea.
- They're punks.


33
00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:19.824
- We're supposed to give them a chance.
- Come on!


34
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:22.655
You're gonna side with them?
They're not real cops!


35
00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:24.958
They can't even carry guns,
for God's sakes.


36
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.295
Maybe you should spend a little more
time worrying about your own guys...


37
00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:30.345
- and a little less time...
- What's that supposed to mean?


38
00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:34.100
Nothing. These kids can get into
a thousand places that we can't.


39
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:41.137
You three really screwed up tonight.
Get your feet off that table. Get up!


40
00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:44.307
What are you talking about, man?
We got the job done.


41
00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:47.944
- Yeah, we set the bad guys up, right?
- Why don't you shut up and listen.


42
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.098
You should be yelling at the cops
for beating up kids.


43
00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:52.249
You smacked Detective Tricky
in the mouth.


44
00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.963
Do you think this is a joke?
You little numb-nut.


45
00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:03.763
Okay, Bob, I'll take care of this.
Let me take care of this.


46
00:05:03.835 --> 00:05:05.496
- Yeah, Bob!
- Hey!


47
00:05:07.005 --> 00:05:09.371
Sit down and shut up. Sit!

48
00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.645
You think this is a joke?

49
00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:17.307
If you think it's a joke, I'll stick you
right back into the cells...


50
00:05:17.382 --> 00:05:19.509
where I found you.

51
00:05:19.584 --> 00:05:22.246
You're policemen now.
Stop screwing around...


52
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:24.414
and start doing your job.

53
00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:26.889
If you're gonna start overacting
like circus freaks...


54
00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.086
you might as well be wearin' badges,
for crying out loud!


55
00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:31.789
Are we done yet?

56
00:05:31.863 --> 00:05:34.832
- Excuse me?
- Are we done?


57
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.993
You're done when I say we're done.

58
00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:39.347
- Is that Harry? It looks like him.
- All right, everybody.


59
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:42.431
- Listen up.
- Save it for the kiddies, Greer.


60
00:05:46.278 --> 00:05:48.212
That's pretty funny.

61
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.443
All right, tough guy.

62
00:05:53.518 --> 00:05:56.885
If you or anybody else
has got a problem with my squad...


63
00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:59.446
you gotta go through me first.

64
00:05:59.524 --> 00:06:00.957
Any takers?

65
00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:48.136
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.


66
00:06:48.206 --> 00:06:50.231
Thanks for asking.

67
00:06:50.308 --> 00:06:52.387
Eckford and Lanier aren't here.
I got something to do.


68
00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:54.345
We'll get started without them.
Follow me.


69
00:06:56.581 --> 00:06:58.515
You guys see that club down there?

70
00:07:00.585 --> 00:07:04.544
We have reason to believe there's
a black book operation goin' on inside.


71
00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:08.252
- What's black book?
- Hookers. Expensive ones.


72
00:07:08.326 --> 00:07:11.853
Young girls. We also think
the manager, Red Wilson, is involved.


73
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.593
Julie, you go inside undercover as
a waitress and hopefully get recruited.


74
00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:18.465
Why does she always get to be
the prostitute?


75
00:07:18.537 --> 00:07:21.233
You two will go inside,
split up, blend...


76
00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:24.366
work the room and keep your eye
on this Red character.


77
00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:29.175
All right, listen to me.

78
00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:31.272
Be nice to these guys.

79
00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:35.376
They've been on this case for a while.
They're not gonna like working with you.


80
00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.445
Do what they tell you to
and remember to...


81
00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:40.252
- Keep our noses clean?
- Exactly.


82
00:07:40.325 --> 00:07:43.385
- Sorry we're late, Adam.
- Yeah, sorry we're late.


83
00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:46.556
- Hey, no excuses, partner.
- You're not my partner.


84
00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:49.924
We went over the assignments
and the background.


85
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.561
You guys work out the logistics
amongst yourselves.


86
00:07:58.743 --> 00:08:00.677
Which one's Eckford
and which one's Lanier?


87
00:08:00.745 --> 00:08:03.680
Save it. This is our case.

88
00:08:03.748 --> 00:08:06.046
We don't want you little pussies
playing cop inside.


89
00:08:06.117 --> 00:08:08.347
Making our J-O-B
all that much harder.


90
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.911
You dig?

91
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:14.825
She comes in. Yeah.

92
00:08:16.294 --> 00:08:18.228
There you go, little girl.

93
00:08:18.296 --> 00:08:21.493
Two grams, asshole.

94
00:08:21.566 --> 00:08:25.195
- Call a cop.
- Fuck you, pig!


95
00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:35.012
Are you okay?

96
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.279
- Yeah.
- You wanna come back inside?


97
00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:18.882
Excuse me.

98
00:09:18.957 --> 00:09:21.949
- Listen, I gotta meet up with Greer.
- What, now?


99
00:09:22.027 --> 00:09:24.188
Yeah, you know how the man is
about punctuality.


100
00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:26.287
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:09:26.364 --> 00:09:29.925
- Keep an eye out for Julie, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


102
00:09:42.113 --> 00:09:44.343
Hey! How's it goin', girl?

103
00:09:47.552 --> 00:09:49.884
You wanna come up to my office
after your shift?


104
00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:52.423
I've been meaning to ask you
if I can work some extra hours.


105
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.822
- I can really use the cash.
- Yeah, yeah.


106
00:09:54.893 --> 00:09:59.227
Well, I, you know...
We'll see what we can do. Huh?


107
00:10:13.445 --> 00:10:15.743
You mind if I cut in?

108
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:19.075
Hey, there.

109
00:10:23.955 --> 00:10:25.582
How you been? Long time.

110
00:10:27.158 --> 00:10:28.716
Yeah.

111
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:36.592
God, what's it been,
like three years?


112
00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:41.628
I never thought I'd see you again.
You look really great, you know?


113
00:10:46.077 --> 00:10:48.568
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah.


114
00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:51.673
Can I get a club soda
with a lemon?


115
00:10:53.284 --> 00:10:54.581
Really?

116
00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:56.416
I have two years in July.

117
00:10:58.089 --> 00:11:00.353
Right on.
Year and a half last month.


118
00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:03.326
Really? That's great.

119
00:11:07.232 --> 00:11:09.496
You been doin' this long or what?

120
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.961
- Sorry.
- It's all right.


121
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.941
I haven't seen that smile
in a long time.


122
00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:24.712
So, I guess I should let you
get back to work.


123
00:11:27.819 --> 00:11:29.309
Yeah.

124
00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:36.122
Hey, listen.
Can I see you again?


125
00:11:38.263 --> 00:11:39.321
Okay.

126
00:11:40.465 --> 00:11:41.523
Okay, then?

127
00:12:17.902 --> 00:12:19.836
Oh, my God!

128
00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:27.073
- Tiffany!
- Uh-oh.


129
00:12:28.947 --> 00:12:30.676
What "uh-oh"?

130
00:12:39.324 --> 00:12:41.383
Okay, wait, wait.

131
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.395
Get up!

132
00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:54.765
Get the hell out of here!

133
00:13:04.716 --> 00:13:07.844
I saw Greer roll up on this cat
with leather pants.


134
00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:09.250
What?

135
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.450
The dude from the bust.
I saw Greer pick him up.


136
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.261
It was the same guy
I saw at the bust last week.


137
00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:23.426
- A cop was helping him get away.
- Are you sure it was Greer?


138
00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:28.270
- Looked like his car.
- Every car looks like his car.


139
00:13:28.339 --> 00:13:30.273
That's the point of the car.

140
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:32.901
Dude, you're paranoid.

141
00:13:32.977 --> 00:13:35.445
Nice job!

142
00:13:35.513 --> 00:13:39.279
Okay, I really did not
like that at all, all right?


143
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.251
Let me just explain somethin'.
I was blending.


144
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.255
You just blended your ass
right out of the club, man.


145
00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:48.918
Oh, come on! They're gonna
let me back in the club.


146
00:13:48.993 --> 00:13:52.156
I believe the words were
"you're gone for-fucking-ever."


147
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.529
- Greer's gonna kick your ass.
- You know what? Eat me.


148
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.160
Come on. Let's go.
You wanna lose another fight, Petey?


149
00:13:58.236 --> 00:14:01.034
Who was the guy that
you were talkin' to all night?


150
00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:03.471
- What guy?
- Yeah, "what guy."


151
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:05.133
A suspect?

152
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.373
What? No. I don't even know
what he's talkin' about.


153
00:14:08.446 --> 00:14:12.314
How could you see anything? You had your
head buried in a pair of tits all night.


154
00:14:12.383 --> 00:14:15.875
I could see things because
I got eyes behind my head, all right?


155
00:14:15.954 --> 00:14:19.253
- Julie's got a boyfriend
- Please grow up.


156
00:14:19.324 --> 00:14:22.452
Let's all together, in harmony.

157
00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:26.827
Hey, mommy! Where you goin'
with that fine little ass, baby?


158
00:14:26.898 --> 00:14:30.356
Why don't you get out in the street
and earn a real living, huh?


159
00:14:30.435 --> 00:14:32.300
- What?
- She digs me.


160
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.737
- You have your hall pass, young lady?
- You wanna see my hall pass?


161
00:14:35.807 --> 00:14:38.298
Yeah, and then I wanna see you
in detention.


162
00:14:38.376 --> 00:14:41.470
Why do you have to be such a pussy?
Leave her alone.


163
00:14:41.546 --> 00:14:43.741
Who you callin' a pussy, pussy?

164
00:14:43.815 --> 00:14:47.478
- Motherfucker.
- Oh, God, you terrify me.


165
00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:51.716
- Tricky, just back off, man.
- Get outta my face, boy.


166
00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:54.121
- What?
- Let's go. In my office.


167
00:14:54.192 --> 00:14:56.126
Move your ass.

168
00:14:56.194 --> 00:14:58.526
In my office. Move your ass!

169
00:15:10.508 --> 00:15:12.999
- Where were you last night?
- Excuse me?


170
00:15:13.077 --> 00:15:15.545
You left me out on the street
for, like, an hour.


171
00:15:15.613 --> 00:15:17.808
I was doin' something.

172
00:15:17.882 --> 00:15:20.874
I'd love to know what you were doin'
while I was out there waitin'.


173
00:15:20.952 --> 00:15:23.113
- It's a police matter.
- What's a police matter?


174
00:15:23.187 --> 00:15:25.332
- Shut your face.
- Why don't you try stealin' drugs...


175
00:15:25.356 --> 00:15:28.223
- from the evidence locker?
- What? What'd you say?


176
00:15:28.293 --> 00:15:29.954
Stealin' drugs
from the evidence locker.


177
00:15:30.028 --> 00:15:32.519
You better watch what you say
and who you're saying it to.


178
00:15:32.597 --> 00:15:34.929
- Let me tell you something, Linc.
- Save it.


179
00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:37.092
Shut up and listen to me.

180
00:15:37.168 --> 00:15:40.467
One of these days, you'll wake up
and be 30. Who knows? Maybe even 40.


181
00:15:40.538 --> 00:15:43.268
Get up when I talk to you.
Get up.


182
00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:47.201
And you're gonna be alone,
all alone.


183
00:15:47.278 --> 00:15:50.475
You're gonna realize not everybody
in this world is your enemy.


184
00:15:50.548 --> 00:15:55.918
I'm trying to do my job. I suggest you
do the same and quit breaking my balls.


185
00:15:58.923 --> 00:16:01.050
It's enough already.

186
00:16:03.628 --> 00:16:06.495
Get off my desk, please.

187
00:16:06.564 --> 00:16:10.125
- Is there any luck at the club?
- Look, Captain.


188
00:16:10.201 --> 00:16:14.865
We're just trying to get
really, really deep undercover.


189
00:16:14.939 --> 00:16:15.963
Yeah.

190
00:16:17.575 --> 00:16:19.907
- The manager's a real creep.
- Yeah? And?


191
00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:22.378
It feels like there's definitely
something going on in there.


192
00:16:22.413 --> 00:16:26.440
I don't care about feelings. This isn't
a feelings business. Get some evidence.


193
00:16:26.517 --> 00:16:29.247
You're on the roof
with Eckford and Lanier.


194
00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:35.424
Take off those stupid sunglasses
and do what you're told.


195
00:16:35.493 --> 00:16:37.188
Yes, sir.

196
00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:40.424
There are people breathing down my neck
to get rid of all three of you.


197
00:16:40.498 --> 00:16:43.023
- What'd we do?
- Arson, assault and robbery.


198
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:47.197
Now, get out. And remember, I'm the only
thing keeping you clowns out of prison.


199
00:16:47.271 --> 00:16:50.798
- Man, this job sucks!
- Beats jail.


200
00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:52.809
A deal's a deal.

201
00:17:10.528 --> 00:17:12.393
- What the hell?
- Dude, they're not there.


202
00:17:12.463 --> 00:17:16.559
- What are you doin' in here?
- Eckford and Lanier.


203
00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:18.827
What?

204
00:17:18.903 --> 00:17:21.736
They never showed.
Give me the keys.


205
00:17:23.508 --> 00:17:27.501
- The keys to what?
- I got no car. This is a stakeout.


206
00:17:30.014 --> 00:17:32.175
- Are you crazy? Hell no.
- Come on!


207
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:36.550
This is a cop thing. You can't just
leave me standing there like an asshole.


208
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:40.751
- I swear to God, man. One scratch...
- All right.


209
00:18:09.053 --> 00:18:13.046
- What can I get you, slick?
- I'll take a malt liquor, sister.


210
00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:16.321
I need you to find out everything
you can about this guy over there...


211
00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:19.386
with the blonde hair
and leather pants in the booth.


212
00:18:20.531 --> 00:18:22.123
Is he your guy?

213
00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:24.095
Yeah.

214
00:18:25.136 --> 00:18:27.070
All right.
I'll see what I can do.


215
00:18:48.793 --> 00:18:51.785
- What?
- It's so freaky to see you again.


216
00:18:51.863 --> 00:18:53.387
- Freaky?
- Yeah.


217
00:18:53.464 --> 00:18:57.161
- Maybe it's just the hair. I don't know.
- My hair?


218
00:19:00.204 --> 00:19:02.604
I wanna say that I'm sorry
about what happened before.


219
00:19:02.673 --> 00:19:06.131
About not calling
and disappearing like that.


220
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.202
- I was an asshole.
- Forget it. It was a long time ago.


221
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.760
- We were both really fucked up.
- Yeah, I know, but I'm sorry.


222
00:19:11.816 --> 00:19:15.582
- I'm sorry that I hurt you.
- Forgiven. It's over. We're movin' on.


223
00:19:17.288 --> 00:19:21.850
What are you doin' in this place
other than keeping me from my job?


224
00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:23.291
Take a break?

225
00:19:23.361 --> 00:19:25.591
Now?

226
00:19:25.663 --> 00:19:27.756
- Just to talk.
- Yeah.


227
00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:38.802
You can page me
if you need to talk to me.


228
00:19:38.876 --> 00:19:40.969
See ya!

229
00:19:41.045 --> 00:19:44.606
- Bye, Gilbert.
- Let's go. You can do this later.


230
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.387
How are you doin'?

231
00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:55.252
- I'm all right.
- Are you here with someone?


232
00:19:55.326 --> 00:19:58.693
- No.
- Would you like to be?


233
00:20:00.598 --> 00:20:02.532
Maybe later. I gotta go.

234
00:20:08.406 --> 00:20:11.102
Not really goin' for
waitress of the month, are you?


235
00:20:11.175 --> 00:20:13.541
Apparently not. I missed you.

236
00:20:21.219 --> 00:20:23.153
- Hey, there.
- Hi.


237
00:20:24.622 --> 00:20:26.715
Whoa, whoa.
I thought we were just gonna talk.


238
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:28.816
Oh, please.

239
00:20:31.662 --> 00:20:33.562
Hey, my man!

240
00:21:00.024 --> 00:21:02.857
Okay, give me the keys.
Give me the keys!


241
00:21:02.927 --> 00:21:05.259
Gilbert, no, man.
I'm giving you a ride. That's enough.


242
00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:07.263
Give me the keys.

243
00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:11.259
- Be careful.
- Always.


244
00:21:11.335 --> 00:21:13.200
- Pop the trunk.
- Why?


245
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:17.367
Because it's cold and buggin'.
I want my jacket. Okay, Gilbert?


246
00:21:33.624 --> 00:21:36.149
Put on your jacket and let's go!

247
00:21:36.227 --> 00:21:38.320
- Ah, man!
- "Ah, man" what?


248
00:21:38.396 --> 00:21:40.261
- Hey.
- Cops!


249
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:43.391
Cops? Shit!

250
00:21:43.467 --> 00:21:44.729
Get the car!

251
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.415
Shit!

252
00:22:00.484 --> 00:22:02.418
Shit, shit, shit!

253
00:22:16.133 --> 00:22:17.623
Come on, man!

254
00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:45.695
Sorry!

255
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.233
Who's your friend?

256
00:23:57.301 --> 00:24:01.135
Look, man, I was just giving him
a lift, man. That's all.


257
00:24:01.205 --> 00:24:02.297
Where?

258
00:24:02.373 --> 00:24:05.035
Just under the Sixth St. bridge.
That was all.


259
00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:07.407
I was just gonna take him
under the Sixth St. bridge!


260
00:24:07.478 --> 00:24:09.412
His name's Gilbert O'Reilly.

261
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.177
I told him I'd give him a ride.
I was, like, designated driver.


262
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.309
You know, like a car pool.

263
00:24:15.386 --> 00:24:18.150
I'll take you to where he lives.
Okay, you want a car wash?


264
00:24:18.222 --> 00:24:21.589
I work at the Valley Car Wash.
I'll give you a free car wash...


265
00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:23.923
on the...

266
00:24:34.238 --> 00:24:36.706
Julie, someone said
they saw you come in here.


267
00:24:36.774 --> 00:24:39.902
- What?
- What are you doing in here?


268
00:24:39.977 --> 00:24:42.172
What do you think I'm doing, Red?

269
00:24:46.016 --> 00:24:50.680
I've been lookin' for you all night.
You're not supposed to be in the VIP.


270
00:24:50.754 --> 00:24:54.349
Finish up and get your ass
back down to work.


271
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.799
Oh, my God.

272
00:25:05.803 --> 00:25:08.328
- I guess I should get back to work.
- Oh, really?


273
00:25:08.405 --> 00:25:10.532
Yeah. You can stay up here,
if you want.


274
00:25:10.608 --> 00:25:13.338
- You know what? I have to go.
- Oh, okay.


275
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.937
- I have to go to this club.
- That's cool.


276
00:25:17.014 --> 00:25:20.780
Look. Here's my number.
You call me. I mean it.


277
00:25:20.851 --> 00:25:24.753
Whenever you need anything,
anytime, please.


278
00:25:28.459 --> 00:25:32.361
- Okay?
- It's nice talking to you.


279
00:25:32.429 --> 00:25:34.454
It's nice talking to you too.

280
00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:37.895
- See you.
- See you.


281
00:25:42.506 --> 00:25:44.497
Oh, God.

282
00:25:48.279 --> 00:25:50.713
Linc, I can't believe it, man.

283
00:25:50.781 --> 00:25:52.715
I mean, I can't...

284
00:25:52.783 --> 00:25:56.082
I mean, I can't believe it, man.

285
00:25:57.621 --> 00:25:59.020
Dude...

286
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.956
If people could learn
to drive in this city!


287
00:26:08.332 --> 00:26:12.029
I'm gonna call my lawyer friend,
all right? No, no, no.


288
00:26:12.102 --> 00:26:14.093
Where you goin'?

289
00:26:14.171 --> 00:26:16.298
I gotta tell Jules we're goin'.

290
00:26:16.373 --> 00:26:18.705
What about that guy?

291
00:26:18.776 --> 00:26:22.371
I caught the guy.
He talked, and I let him go.


292
00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:25.173
All right.

293
00:26:41.432 --> 00:26:43.366
You sure about this, Linc?

294
00:26:43.434 --> 00:26:46.494
Look, the dude said the guys
are meeting a cop under this bridge.


295
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.437
Greer's got nothin'
to do with drugs, man.


296
00:26:49.506 --> 00:26:51.906
He helped me get sober, you know?

297
00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:01.346
Could you have parked
further away?


298
00:27:01.418 --> 00:27:03.943
- Precautions, man.
- Paranoid, man.


299
00:27:47.798 --> 00:27:49.698
Oh, my God.

300
00:27:49.767 --> 00:27:52.099
It's Greer.

301
00:27:53.804 --> 00:27:55.169
Oh, man.

302
00:28:02.312 --> 00:28:04.303
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

303
00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:09.511
I mean, I can't believe it.

304
00:28:17.394 --> 00:28:19.328
Is that cocaine?

305
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.244
So, what do we do?

306
00:28:35.312 --> 00:28:37.974
We gotta get
the hell out of here.


307
00:28:38.048 --> 00:28:40.380
I'm not gonna just leave him here.

308
00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:42.885
What are you talkin' about?
Let's go.


309
00:28:42.953 --> 00:28:46.787
Wait, wait, wait.
We're cops, all right?


310
00:28:46.857 --> 00:28:49.849
We're on the scene.
This is our job. All right?


311
00:28:49.927 --> 00:28:52.361
We're not that kind of cops, man.

312
00:28:54.264 --> 00:28:57.392
We gotta go now! Come on!

313
00:29:29.066 --> 00:29:31.000
You all right?

314
00:29:34.571 --> 00:29:36.664
I can't believe he's dead.

315
00:29:39.243 --> 00:29:43.543
They're gonna think we were in on it.
They're gonna come for us.


316
00:29:43.614 --> 00:29:46.139
Why would they come for us?

317
00:29:47.818 --> 00:29:50.946
Because we're in the clubs, Pete.
We're his kids.


318
00:29:52.289 --> 00:29:54.723
Greer wasn't like that.
It was a setup.


319
00:29:58.629 --> 00:30:00.620
All right, look.

320
00:30:00.697 --> 00:30:03.894
You were sick. We were giving you a lift
home. That's why we left the club.


321
00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:05.332
Okay? All right?

322
00:30:05.402 --> 00:30:06.733
Okay.

323
00:30:11.642 --> 00:30:14.008
Show time.

324
00:30:30.127 --> 00:30:33.654
I'm Detective Briggs, Internal Affairs.
I just got a few questions for you.


325
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.163
Okay.

326
00:30:35.232 --> 00:30:38.531
- Tell me where you were tonight.
- I don't know.


327
00:30:38.602 --> 00:30:40.763
We sent a car over to the club.

328
00:30:40.838 --> 00:30:43.033
- None of you were there.
- Julie was sick.


329
00:30:43.106 --> 00:30:45.597
- How are you doing, Julie?
- I'm all right.


330
00:30:45.676 --> 00:30:47.701
- What was wrong?
- I don't know.


331
00:30:47.778 --> 00:30:50.474
Do I look like a doctor?
I said she wasn't feeling well.


332
00:30:50.547 --> 00:30:54.108
No, I was in the...
I was in the bar.


333
00:30:54.184 --> 00:30:56.345
- No work tonight?
- I had an upset stomach...


334
00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.014
so I left work early,
and Pete and Linc drove me home.


335
00:30:59.089 --> 00:31:02.217
No, no, no.
I was outside the bar.


336
00:31:02.292 --> 00:31:05.352
You guys must be gettin'
pretty tight.


337
00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:08.330
- Not really.
- Not really?


338
00:31:08.398 --> 00:31:11.629
Julie got sick in the bar,
and I had to take her home.


339
00:31:11.702 --> 00:31:16.139
I went in the bar to get Linc,
'cause I can't drive Linc's...


340
00:31:16.206 --> 00:31:19.664
- So you just took off?
- Eckford and Lanier, they left too.


341
00:31:19.743 --> 00:31:22.576
- Where were Eckford and Lanier?
- I don't know.


342
00:31:25.048 --> 00:31:28.643
- Ask me a question. Anything you want.
- Where were you when Greer got shot?


343
00:31:28.719 --> 00:31:30.016
What?

344
00:31:30.087 --> 00:31:32.521
- Greer's dead?
- Sorry.


345
00:31:32.589 --> 00:31:37.583
Two shots to the chest.
It looked like something exploded.


346
00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:40.994
You know what you're doin'? You're
tryin' to play on my emotions right now.


347
00:31:41.064 --> 00:31:45.023
That's what you're tryin' to do.
I know this whole game.


348
00:31:45.102 --> 00:31:47.229
I know...

349
00:31:47.304 --> 00:31:51.070
- What do you know?
- I don't know anything.


350
00:31:51.141 --> 00:31:53.609
Except that we found drugs
on the scene.


351
00:31:53.677 --> 00:31:56.339
Cocaine. We're running tests.

352
00:31:56.413 --> 00:31:59.871
We think it may be the stuff
from the evidence locker.


353
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.885
You look a little nervous, Pete.
Something you wanna tell me?


354
00:32:02.953 --> 00:32:06.787
- You know anything about drugs, Julie?
- Enough to stay away.


355
00:32:06.857 --> 00:32:08.620
Do I need to call a lawyer?

356
00:32:13.196 --> 00:32:16.597
Not yet. But we may need you
for additional questioning...


357
00:32:16.667 --> 00:32:19.033
so don't go anywhere.

358
00:32:24.675 --> 00:32:28.736
- Were you crying?
- No!


359
00:32:28.812 --> 00:32:30.905
How are you holding up?

360
00:32:30.981 --> 00:32:33.779
We're fine.

361
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.149
Well, they're suspending the unit,
pending further investigation.


362
00:32:45.495 --> 00:32:48.396
- What did Briggs tell you?
- Nothin'.


363
00:32:48.465 --> 00:32:52.561
Our captain's dead, they don't know what
happened and they found drugs on him.


364
00:32:52.636 --> 00:32:54.570
They think they're from
the evidence locker.


365
00:32:54.638 --> 00:32:56.572
Every man's gotta
make a living, right?


366
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.074
Shut up.

367
00:32:59.142 --> 00:33:01.610
You didn't even know him.
He was a great cop. Shut up!


368
00:33:08.385 --> 00:33:10.353
A little too much coffee.

369
00:33:11.722 --> 00:33:14.020
Oh, baby.

370
00:33:20.263 --> 00:33:21.924
Look, um...

371
00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:24.695
I'm gonna do what I can
to get you back on.


372
00:33:24.768 --> 00:33:28.295
And I'm gonna do it because
it's what Adam Greer would've wanted.


373
00:33:28.372 --> 00:33:30.772
But you're gonna have
to lay low...


374
00:33:30.841 --> 00:33:33.935
for a while, so...

375
00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:37.674
I can't believe I'm doin' this.

376
00:33:37.748 --> 00:33:41.047
This is my address
and home phone.


377
00:33:43.253 --> 00:33:45.380
If you need anything.

378
00:33:46.957 --> 00:33:48.356
Thanks.

379
00:33:53.697 --> 00:33:55.631
He was my friend.

380
00:33:58.668 --> 00:34:00.602
Since when's he so friendly?

381
00:34:02.239 --> 00:34:05.868
- Since maybe his best friend just died.
- So what.


382
00:34:05.942 --> 00:34:07.842
So what?

383
00:34:09.579 --> 00:34:12.980
- You're an asshole. Greer was...
- Greer was what?


384
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.417
You're actin' like this guy was
your best friend. He wasn't your daddy.


385
00:34:20.857 --> 00:34:24.486
Fuck you! You guys wanna play like this
doesn't matter, like you don't care?


386
00:34:27.097 --> 00:34:28.496
Fine, I'm out.

387
00:35:30.961 --> 00:35:33.395
This is Billy. Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.


388
00:35:50.247 --> 00:35:53.011
You ready to get
to the bottom of this?


389
00:35:55.652 --> 00:35:57.586
What do you mean?

390
00:35:57.654 --> 00:36:00.919
Well, for starters, we gotta
find that guy with the leather pants.


391
00:36:01.925 --> 00:36:04.621
So, what... How do you think
we're gonna do that?


392
00:36:05.929 --> 00:36:08.796
I know a friend of his.

393
00:36:17.507 --> 00:36:20.032
- For me?
- Is what for you?


394
00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:23.011
- The fish?
- For you.


395
00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:24.706
Thank you.

396
00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:26.544
Can I come in?

397
00:36:26.616 --> 00:36:28.550
Yeah, I'm sorry. Of course.

398
00:36:28.618 --> 00:36:32.281
- Your address was listed, so...
- I'm so proud to have one.


399
00:36:34.858 --> 00:36:38.817
You sounded so depressed on the message.
I thought I'd come by and cheer you up.


400
00:36:38.895 --> 00:36:40.760
Thank you.

401
00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.861
God, I must look like shit.
I've been asleep all day.


402
00:36:45.936 --> 00:36:48.996
- That's not possible.
- Yeah, actually.


403
00:36:54.344 --> 00:36:57.370
- I'm sorry. Whoops.
- It's all right. It's okay.


404
00:36:59.683 --> 00:37:02.117
That the perp's place, bro?

405
00:37:02.185 --> 00:37:05.018
- Yeah.
- Stop, bro.


406
00:37:05.088 --> 00:37:09.218
- Stop, stop.
- What?


407
00:37:09.292 --> 00:37:11.988
I think I should drive in
and make the collar.


408
00:37:12.062 --> 00:37:15.031
Are you crazy? Man, you're lucky
I let you ride in the car.


409
00:37:15.098 --> 00:37:17.828
Dude, the guy knows
what you look like, all right?


410
00:37:17.901 --> 00:37:19.266
So?

411
00:37:20.437 --> 00:37:22.371
Dude, your cover's been blown,
all right?


412
00:37:22.439 --> 00:37:26.671
Your cover's been blown.
Your cover has been blown. All right?


413
00:37:27.978 --> 00:37:30.242
I gotta do it. That's it.

414
00:37:31.481 --> 00:37:34.746
Dude, I'm gonna go in there
and I'm gonna bring him out.


415
00:37:36.786 --> 00:37:40.051
Bro, I'm still under. I got it.

416
00:38:36.713 --> 00:38:38.305
Oh, shit!

417
00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:40.645
Shit! Shit!

418
00:38:43.019 --> 00:38:44.919
Stop! Police!

419
00:39:08.278 --> 00:39:10.644
Hey! Somebody grab that guy!

420
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.349
Grab that guy!

421
00:39:35.972 --> 00:39:37.462
Goddamn it!

422
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.873
Look, I told you, man,
that's not even my stuff, okay?


423
00:39:40.944 --> 00:39:42.969
It's some... What?

424
00:39:43.046 --> 00:39:46.641
I was just giving Gilbert a ride
to meet some cop.


425
00:39:46.716 --> 00:39:50.812
It was just a car pool situation.
That's not a crime. Just savin' gas.


426
00:39:58.328 --> 00:40:01.388
Dude, I'm sorry about the car.
He was gettin' away.


427
00:40:01.464 --> 00:40:03.398
I mean, what do you
want me to do?


428
00:40:05.635 --> 00:40:09.162
- Dude, it's just water.
- Save it!


429
00:40:09.239 --> 00:40:11.799
Look, where's leather pants live?

430
00:40:11.875 --> 00:40:13.900
- Who?
- Gilbert O'Reilly.


431
00:40:13.977 --> 00:40:16.172
Look, are you guys really cops?

432
00:40:16.246 --> 00:40:19.374
- 'Cause my boss is just...
- Dude, we're undercover.


433
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:24.113
Really? What'd he do, anyway?

434
00:40:24.187 --> 00:40:26.917
Dude, we think he killed
our boss, all right?


435
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:29.356
Would you shut up?

436
00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:31.894
Yeah, shut up, man!

437
00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:37.459
- You keep tickling me.
- Hold still! I gotta concentrate.


438
00:40:37.534 --> 00:40:39.092
Come on!

439
00:40:39.169 --> 00:40:41.797
- You're being... What're you doin'?
- I gotta go.


440
00:40:41.871 --> 00:40:44.567
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I gotta go.


441
00:40:45.308 --> 00:40:46.741
Why?

442
00:40:47.844 --> 00:40:49.869
I gotta go meet my sponsor.

443
00:40:54.617 --> 00:40:56.642
You're gonna wear my lipstick?

444
00:41:01.658 --> 00:41:04.422
This is my address, okay?

445
00:41:07.664 --> 00:41:10.963
And next week,
I'm gonna cook you dinner.


446
00:41:11.034 --> 00:41:14.162
Since when do you know
how to cook?


447
00:41:14.237 --> 00:41:16.171
I have a week. I'll learn.

448
00:41:18.908 --> 00:41:20.842
- See you.
- See you.


449
00:41:45.435 --> 00:41:47.960
- Watch the car.
- Sorry, man.


450
00:41:51.774 --> 00:41:54.140
- Sure he lives here?
- Yeah.


451
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:58.670
You know, he's a surfer guy,
so he likes to be near the water.


452
00:41:58.748 --> 00:42:00.340
Knock?

453
00:42:06.389 --> 00:42:09.256
I don't think he's home.

454
00:42:09.325 --> 00:42:11.657
Stand back. Stand back!

455
00:42:11.728 --> 00:42:15.391
Oh, shit.
What the hell is wrong with you, man?


456
00:42:15.465 --> 00:42:17.626
- Bro, stand back.
- Where'd you get that from?


457
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.066
Dude, it's my dad's.

458
00:42:20.136 --> 00:42:23.037
Oh, yeah.
You know how to use it?


459
00:42:23.106 --> 00:42:25.131
Bro, you just point and shoot.

460
00:42:25.208 --> 00:42:27.836
Look, just don't point
and shoot at me.


461
00:42:27.911 --> 00:42:30.971
You know what? 
No guns, okay?

462
00:42:31.047 --> 00:42:32.810
- Guns are bad.
- Shut up!


463
00:42:32.882 --> 00:42:35.373
- I know a guy once...
- Shut up!


464
00:42:37.687 --> 00:42:40.212
Do a perimeter search, all right?
Cover me.


465
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.781
- With what?
- Cover me.


466
00:43:04.981 --> 00:43:06.915
Are you nuts?

467
00:43:09.586 --> 00:43:11.520
All right.

468
00:43:13.022 --> 00:43:14.956
What do we do now?

469
00:43:16.793 --> 00:43:20.786
- We wait.
- Cops wait.


470
00:44:18.721 --> 00:44:20.245
Hello?

471
00:44:20.323 --> 00:44:22.257
I think I have the wrong number.

472
00:44:33.036 --> 00:44:35.504
- Hello?
- Who's this?


473
00:44:35.571 --> 00:44:38.768
- Who's this?
- Who's this?


474
00:44:38.841 --> 00:44:41.241
I told you not to pick up
the fuckin' phone!


475
00:44:53.823 --> 00:44:55.415
Hello. Yellow Cab.

476
00:44:55.491 --> 00:44:57.959
Can I get a cab
over at Hollywood and Vine?


477
00:45:08.805 --> 00:45:10.739
- Pull over here.
- All right.


478
00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:14.467
Here you go.

479
00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:22.345
Well?

480
00:45:24.187 --> 00:45:26.747
- Hold on. Wait a second.
- All right.


481
00:45:43.372 --> 00:45:44.999
Follow that Caddie.

482
00:45:45.074 --> 00:45:46.598
You got it.

483
00:46:24.847 --> 00:46:26.974
- Here you go.
- Keep the change.


484
00:47:00.082 --> 00:47:02.141
Come on.
Do some business with me.


485
00:47:02.218 --> 00:47:04.243
Do you see I'm busy?

486
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.298
- Leave me alone.
- It'll just take a couple minutes.


487
00:47:06.322 --> 00:47:11.760
I'll leave you alone as soon as we deal
with this in the back with some privacy.


488
00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:15.889
- You're driving me crazy.
- All right. Shut up!


489
00:47:15.965 --> 00:47:18.934
I love you, sweetheart.
You know, you're a pain in the ass.


490
00:47:19.001 --> 00:47:20.935
- Come on.
- You're a pain in the ass!


491
00:47:21.003 --> 00:47:24.268
Yeah, but you love me. I'm a pain
in the ass, but you love my ass.


492
00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:49.491
You're making me laugh.
You wanna make a big deal with me?


493
00:47:49.565 --> 00:47:51.499
I know you got something
goin' down...


494
00:47:51.567 --> 00:47:53.501
with one of your bands and drugs...

495
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:56.402
You leave the fuckin' boys
outta this!


496
00:47:56.472 --> 00:47:58.406
- They can really rock and roll.
- What?


497
00:47:58.474 --> 00:48:01.637
This is a joke, right?
You are a pimp, Billy.


498
00:48:01.711 --> 00:48:04.976
A pimp. You do drugs.
That doesn't mean you should sell 'em.


499
00:48:05.047 --> 00:48:07.140
Just say no, man.

500
00:48:07.216 --> 00:48:10.982
Just tell me when and where it's goin'
down and I will bring the cash, okay?


501
00:48:11.053 --> 00:48:14.750
You wanna be a big shot?
You wanna make the big fuckin' deal?


502
00:48:14.824 --> 00:48:18.260
Okay, you're in. But you better not
mess with me or I'll crush your balls.


503
00:48:18.327 --> 00:48:21.990
- I would not mess with you.
- Or the band. They really got a future.


504
00:48:22.064 --> 00:48:25.056
- Okay, okay. Can I use your phone?
- Who are you gonna call?


505
00:48:25.134 --> 00:48:27.694
I'm gonna call the cops, Howard.

506
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:30.238
Funny, very funny.
Keep it local.


507
00:48:38.047 --> 00:48:41.278
Bob? Hey. Yeah,
I just talked to him. Deal's set.


508
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:46.344
You relax, Bob. None of them have
any idea that I know they're cops.


509
00:48:46.422 --> 00:48:49.619
Especially her. Look,
I'm her goddamn dream man, okay?


510
00:48:49.692 --> 00:48:53.253
No, you listen to me! If you wanna have
somebody else take a shot...


511
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:55.763
like Tricky or one of
the other men in blue that...


512
00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.228
The what? All right.

513
00:49:00.303 --> 00:49:03.704
I gotta go. Something's come up.

514
00:49:03.773 --> 00:49:06.435
I gotta go. Bye.

515
00:49:07.977 --> 00:49:11.276
- Wow.
- Hi, baby.


516
00:49:11.347 --> 00:49:13.212
- Is this for me?
- Mm-hmm.


517
00:49:13.282 --> 00:49:15.307
Really? Come here.

518
00:49:51.587 --> 00:49:53.521
Dude, I think there's something
down there, bro.


519
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:55.614
- What?
- I don't know. Wait!


520
00:49:55.691 --> 00:49:57.784
I hear some voices down there.

521
00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:01.193
- It's the ocean.
- Wait. No, listen.


522
00:50:02.498 --> 00:50:04.864
Get back in the car.

523
00:50:04.934 --> 00:50:08.665
Get back in the car.
No, I will shoot you.


524
00:50:08.738 --> 00:50:11.798
- Get back in the car.
- All right.


525
00:50:13.342 --> 00:50:15.810
Let's go.

526
00:50:31.027 --> 00:50:34.053
Be quiet, Gilbert. All right?

527
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:36.030
Sit down!

528
00:50:39.935 --> 00:50:41.527
Bye, Gilbert.

529
00:51:09.832 --> 00:51:12.062
Man, I thought I told you, no guns.

530
00:51:27.483 --> 00:51:28.916
My ankle! Shit!

531
00:51:36.926 --> 00:51:38.723
Oh, Jesus. Who's this?

532
00:51:38.794 --> 00:51:40.728
- Beats me.
- Come on.


533
00:51:40.796 --> 00:51:43.230
Let's dump him in the trailer
with Gilbert.


534
00:52:04.787 --> 00:52:07.017
I gotta go.
I gotta get out of here.


535
00:52:07.089 --> 00:52:09.023
All right?

536
00:52:11.193 --> 00:52:13.684
- Where are you goin', man?
- I don't know, man.


537
00:52:13.762 --> 00:52:17.789
I just gotta go, all right?
What are you gonna do, hit me?


538
00:52:20.402 --> 00:52:24.270
- Yeah, right.
- Don't be stupid, Pete.


539
00:52:27.209 --> 00:52:29.404
You're callin' me stupid?

540
00:52:29.478 --> 00:52:34.677
I got a fucked up ankle.
I got brain and blood all over my body.


541
00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:38.277
And I'm fuckin' stupid.
You know what? Fuck you!


542
00:52:40.756 --> 00:52:44.089
You know what, man?
You wanna leave? Go ahead, my man.


543
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.094
Matter of fact, take my keys.

544
00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:48.289
I don't give a shit.

545
00:54:36.705 --> 00:54:40.038
His head just exploded, like,
all over the place, all over everything.


546
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:43.601
All over my clothes, my face,
all over...


547
00:54:43.679 --> 00:54:47.945
And then I dropped Linc off at home...

548
00:54:48.017 --> 00:54:51.783
and then I left, you know,
and I just...


549
00:54:51.854 --> 00:54:56.120
I needed someone to talk to
about this whole situation.


550
00:55:07.132 --> 00:55:09.293
I don't want that anymore.

551
00:55:10.702 --> 00:55:12.636
Tough night, Pete.

552
00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.664
It's gonna be okay.

553
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:20.108
I want you to go home,
and I want you to get some rest.


554
00:55:22.314 --> 00:55:26.580
I'm gonna take care of this for you.
I don't know how, but I'm gonna do it.


555
00:55:26.651 --> 00:55:32.453
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you so early.


556
00:55:32.524 --> 00:55:36.893
I hope I didn't wake you up
or disturb your wife or anything.


557
00:55:38.497 --> 00:55:40.431
My wife.

558
00:55:46.605 --> 00:55:50.063
So did you get a look
at these two guys? Hello.


559
00:55:50.141 --> 00:55:51.506
- Yeah.
- What?


560
00:55:51.576 --> 00:55:53.942
What did they look like? Yeah.

561
00:55:54.012 --> 00:55:57.880
I never said that there were two...

562
00:55:57.949 --> 00:56:01.715
No, no. All right.
Have a good time.


563
00:56:01.786 --> 00:56:04.516
No, I think it was too dark...

564
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:06.181
for me to see anything.

565
00:56:06.258 --> 00:56:09.557
Listen. I have to take this call
in the other room.


566
00:56:09.628 --> 00:56:11.027
It's my wife.

567
00:56:11.096 --> 00:56:13.621
Oh, yeah.

568
00:56:16.401 --> 00:56:20.497
Can't you understand I'm tied up?

569
00:56:20.572 --> 00:56:24.804
Not here.
Am I speaking French to you?


570
00:56:43.662 --> 00:56:45.493
What the hell? Not the yard!

571
00:57:53.798 --> 00:57:57.564
- Hey, leave a message after the beep.
- Hey, Linc, you didn't say our na...


572
00:57:57.636 --> 00:58:00.503
Linc, if you get this message,
do not go back to the apartment.


573
00:58:00.572 --> 00:58:02.597
There's cops all over the place.

574
00:58:02.674 --> 00:58:06.269
Just meet me and Julie down at that
place at the beach tomorrow morning.


575
00:58:18.356 --> 00:58:20.290
Hi, Mom.

576
00:58:25.797 --> 00:58:27.788
What's happened to you?

577
00:58:31.236 --> 00:58:35.866
Well, you know,
things are pretty fucked up, Ma.


578
00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:38.067
Don't use that foul language with me.

579
00:58:38.143 --> 00:58:40.703
Who is it, honey?

580
00:58:43.114 --> 00:58:45.241
Hi, Dad.

581
00:58:46.384 --> 00:58:47.646
What do you want?

582
00:58:50.822 --> 00:58:53.916
Let me get you
some clean clothes, okay?


583
00:59:00.965 --> 00:59:03.058
Well, I was...

584
00:59:03.134 --> 00:59:06.297
- I was just... You know, I just...
- We're not bailing you out.


585
00:59:07.939 --> 00:59:11.033
What? What do you mean,
you're not bailing me out?


586
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:13.771
The police already came by.

587
00:59:13.845 --> 00:59:17.941
What? No, no.
The police are in on it, Dad.


588
00:59:18.016 --> 00:59:20.849
- Come on. Save it.
- No, listen to me. Just for a second.


589
00:59:20.919 --> 00:59:23.649
I'm a police officer now, Dad.

590
00:59:23.722 --> 00:59:26.486
- Oh, you're a police officer?
- Yes, I'm a police officer.


591
00:59:26.558 --> 00:59:29.527
Here we go.
Some clean clothes, honey.


592
00:59:29.594 --> 00:59:33.394
- Now clean up. You're a mess.
- I don't need clean clothes right now.


593
00:59:33.465 --> 00:59:36.093
- They're his.
- Officer Pete?


594
00:59:38.236 --> 00:59:40.830
Why are you laughing at me?

595
00:59:43.475 --> 00:59:46.876
Officer Pete. Betty,
you know, at least he got a haircut.


596
00:59:46.945 --> 00:59:50.711
Maybe when they make him captain,
they'll give him a uniform.


597
00:59:50.782 --> 00:59:53.182
Why don't you just
give him a chance?


598
01:00:24.182 --> 01:00:26.616
I'm sorry about your guy.

599
01:00:32.891 --> 01:00:35.655
He wasn't my guy.

600
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.964
Well, I guess not.

601
01:00:42.033 --> 01:00:43.967
He's a pimp.

602
01:00:46.337 --> 01:00:48.271
He's not sober.

603
01:00:51.442 --> 01:00:54.639
And on the phone he was saying
something about Tricky.


604
01:00:57.649 --> 01:01:00.345
The guy was playing with me
the entire time.


605
01:01:16.034 --> 01:01:18.366
Well, I think everything's
gonna be okay.


606
01:01:21.539 --> 01:01:23.473
You think?

607
01:01:24.876 --> 01:01:27.003
It just feels good to say it.

608
01:01:57.876 --> 01:02:00.242
- Good night.
- Good night.


609
01:02:13.691 --> 01:02:15.852
If you need to go to a meeting...

610
01:02:15.927 --> 01:02:18.452
tomorrow morning...

611
01:02:18.529 --> 01:02:23.057
then I can go down
to the pier by myself.


612
01:02:23.134 --> 01:02:25.068
No, it's okay.

613
01:02:26.638 --> 01:02:28.071
Thanks.

614
01:03:03.341 --> 01:03:05.275
Would you just hold me?

615
01:03:21.259 --> 01:03:23.193
Thanks for being here.

616
01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:27.964
You too.

617
01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.211
Damn, Sonny, what took you so long?
I was waitin' out there forever.


618
01:03:45.283 --> 01:03:48.650
What, I don't get no
"Hello. I miss you.


619
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.123
Sorry I didn't call your ass
until I needed some shit"?


620
01:03:53.191 --> 01:03:55.352
What happened to you?
What's with the fishin' hat?


621
01:03:56.527 --> 01:03:58.859
I'm tryin' to stay
on the undercover, man.


622
01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:00.890
Penitentiary life ain't good
for a brother, is it?


623
01:04:00.932 --> 01:04:02.866
You got the info or what, man?

624
01:04:02.934 --> 01:04:05.562
Your man Gilbert O'
Reilly was dealin'.

625
01:04:05.636 --> 01:04:07.831
What you mean "was"?

626
01:04:07.905 --> 01:04:12.672
It was on the news. They found him at
the beach with another dude, both dead.


627
01:04:12.744 --> 01:04:16.737
Cops said it was a murder-suicide.
I think it was some S-M shit myself.


628
01:04:17.815 --> 01:04:20.045
All right, look, Sonny, man.

629
01:04:20.118 --> 01:04:22.643
I'm gonna need to borrow your car.

630
01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.848
Hell, no. You might be named
after Lincoln who freed the slaves...


631
01:04:25.923 --> 01:04:28.391
but I ain't about
to free my wheels up, man.


632
01:04:28.459 --> 01:04:31.087
I got some shit goin' down tonight.

633
01:04:31.162 --> 01:04:33.596
I could use a partner
like the old days, you know?


634
01:04:33.664 --> 01:04:37.122
- Don't waste your breath.
- You know you can run now.


635
01:04:37.201 --> 01:04:40.193
- Sonny.
- Track star!


636
01:04:40.271 --> 01:04:44.037
Just consider this my way of keeping
your skinny ass out of a life of crime.


637
01:04:44.108 --> 01:04:46.372
Don't save me
from a life of crime, man.


638
01:04:46.444 --> 01:04:48.776
Crime pays. Well.

639
01:05:03.528 --> 01:05:05.860
Did you ever break-dance
when you were in school?


640
01:05:08.666 --> 01:05:11.635
- I imagine you did, though.
- I can break-dance.


641
01:05:17.241 --> 01:05:18.674
Disgusting.

642
01:05:21.179 --> 01:05:25.172
I'm like a ladies' man.
I love to dance.


643
01:05:29.921 --> 01:05:31.889
Knock it off.

644
01:05:31.956 --> 01:05:33.583
- What?
- Looking.


645
01:05:33.658 --> 01:05:35.592
Oh, come on.

646
01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.987
Oh, man!
What did you do to my car, man?


647
01:06:05.056 --> 01:06:07.650
- Oh, shit.
- Look at this.


648
01:06:07.725 --> 01:06:09.685
- What did you do to my goddamn car?
- Linc, wait.


649
01:06:09.727 --> 01:06:14.255
Wait. Okay. Just don't say anything
for a second. Let me just explain it.


650
01:06:14.332 --> 01:06:18.769
Let me just explain it,
all right?


651
01:06:18.836 --> 01:06:24.240
- He said something about a big deal.
- Jules, it makes total sense, man.


652
01:06:24.308 --> 01:06:26.242
Last night
I stopped in on a friend.


653
01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:28.744
Got the car, some clothes,
and I got some information.


654
01:06:28.813 --> 01:06:31.145
Turns out that Gilbert
was Tricky's snitch.


655
01:06:31.215 --> 01:06:33.183
Here you go.

656
01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:37.017
I didn't know if you wanted cream
or half and half or sugar or Equal or...


657
01:06:37.088 --> 01:06:40.546
Black's fine. It's fine.

658
01:06:40.625 --> 01:06:43.093
- All right.
- Did I miss something?


659
01:06:47.165 --> 01:06:50.032
- You sure?
- Yes.


660
01:06:50.101 --> 01:06:52.865
Check it out.
All right. Here's what we got.


661
01:06:52.937 --> 01:06:55.735
Now Billy's workin' something,
runnin' with the men in blue.


662
01:06:55.806 --> 01:06:57.784
And Gilbert definitely
didn't take out the bald guy...


663
01:06:57.808 --> 01:06:59.867
so he probably
didn't cap himself either.


664
01:06:59.944 --> 01:07:03.175
So since Gilbert was Tricky's snitch,
he's hooked in too.


665
01:07:03.247 --> 01:07:05.225
And whoever stole the drugs
from the evidence locker...


666
01:07:05.249 --> 01:07:06.716
was trying to frame Captain Greer.

667
01:07:06.784 --> 01:07:09.776
Wait. No, I didn't hear
anything you guys just said.


668
01:07:09.854 --> 01:07:12.618
The cops, man... Tricky,
Eckford, Lanier, the whole gang...


669
01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:14.715
They're all into something.

670
01:07:14.792 --> 01:07:17.955
No. Mothershed. When I was at his house,
he said there were two guys.


671
01:07:18.029 --> 01:07:20.964
- And I never even said that.
- Yeah, right.


672
01:07:21.032 --> 01:07:25.332
Whatever they got goin' got something
to do with Billy, Gilbert and drugs.


673
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:32.170
This is like one of those dirty cop
drug things. This shit really happens?


674
01:07:32.243 --> 01:07:34.370
- Looks that way.
- And Greer was onto him.


675
01:07:34.445 --> 01:07:37.676
That's why there was all
that secret stuff before he died.


676
01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:42.685
That's why he died.

677
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:49.223
He was trying to protect us.

678
01:07:49.293 --> 01:07:50.726
Yeah.

679
01:07:51.996 --> 01:07:53.930
So what now?

680
01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.758
You know, we need to get some evidence.
We need some evidence.


681
01:08:00.838 --> 01:08:03.739
Just trust me. They all
gotta meet up and go over the plan.


682
01:08:03.808 --> 01:08:05.901
- Really?
- Look, these stupid motherfuckers...


683
01:08:05.977 --> 01:08:07.911
are nothin' if not predictable, man.

684
01:08:09.947 --> 01:08:13.405
- So how long do we do this?
- Till something happens.


685
01:08:14.585 --> 01:08:18.851
Is this all that cops do...
Sit around in cars, waiting?


686
01:08:18.923 --> 01:08:20.857
We can go get some doughnuts.

687
01:08:28.065 --> 01:08:29.999
I gotta pee.

688
01:08:42.713 --> 01:08:43.975
What did I tell you?

689
01:08:44.048 --> 01:08:46.710
Looks like that's all of 'em.

690
01:08:48.586 --> 01:08:51.077
- I'm goin' in.
- What?


691
01:08:51.155 --> 01:08:53.248
Pete, your ankle's all messed up.

692
01:08:53.324 --> 01:08:55.087
I'm good at this. Don't worry.

693
01:08:55.159 --> 01:08:56.717
We'll all go.

694
01:08:56.794 --> 01:08:58.853
No. It's too much noise.
Don't worry about it.


695
01:08:58.929 --> 01:09:01.898
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I got it.


696
01:09:05.636 --> 01:09:08.127
You really think
he can pull this off?


697
01:09:09.607 --> 01:09:11.666
That's it. We don't want
no more to do with this.


698
01:09:11.742 --> 01:09:13.710
Come on, Carl.
Don't be such a pussy.


699
01:09:13.778 --> 01:09:15.803
- Don't call me a pussy.
- Fuck you, motherfucker.


700
01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:18.110
- See what this thing is doing to us?
- What?


701
01:09:18.182 --> 01:09:22.278
- We out of here.
- Ah, shit. Come on, Carl. Come here.


702
01:09:22.353 --> 01:09:25.413
- This was supposed to be about drugs.
- Two people are dead.


703
01:09:25.489 --> 01:09:27.889
- Three.
- What?


704
01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:31.553
- The bald guy at Gilbert's.
- Couldn't be helped.


705
01:09:31.629 --> 01:09:33.927
Look, Gilbert was an asshole.

706
01:09:33.998 --> 01:09:35.932
Almost gettin' arrested
at the bust...


707
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.628
not stayin' away after we fired him,
talkin' to Greer.


708
01:09:38.703 --> 01:09:40.330
Little shit deserved to die.

709
01:09:40.404 --> 01:09:44.636
- Why did you have to kill Greer?
- He knew about us and the drugs, okay?


710
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:46.643
Got in the way.

711
01:09:47.712 --> 01:09:50.977
- This is bad. I want out.
- Yeah, me too.


712
01:09:51.048 --> 01:09:53.073
It's too late for that, Carl.

713
01:09:55.252 --> 01:09:56.685
Come on.

714
01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:02.449
This is our lives, asshole.

715
01:10:02.526 --> 01:10:05.859
Now, you wanna get in our way,
you take your best shot.


716
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:08.125
But I ain't guaranteein'
where you'll end up.


717
01:10:08.199 --> 01:10:11.430
Ernie, come on.
Put it down, man.


718
01:10:11.502 --> 01:10:13.094
We're all in this to the end, right?

719
01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:16.936
If this deal goes through,
we're set for life. Come on.


720
01:10:19.176 --> 01:10:21.110
So what's the plan?

721
01:10:21.178 --> 01:10:23.146
Over here. I'm wet. Come on.

722
01:10:24.215 --> 01:10:26.342
All right. Here it is.

723
01:10:26.417 --> 01:10:30.012
Billy set up a big deal
with this rock manager Howard.


724
01:10:30.087 --> 01:10:32.521
- You sure we can trust this Billy guy?
- Yeah.


725
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:35.559
He did a good job sellin' the drugs
after we got rid of Gilbert.


726
01:10:35.626 --> 01:10:37.753
And this new deal is his idea anyhow.

727
01:10:37.828 --> 01:10:40.854
You see, this Howard guy...
He's got some famous rock band...


728
01:10:40.931 --> 01:10:42.990
flyin' in,
and the drugs are on the plane.


729
01:10:43.067 --> 01:10:47.527
- Who's the band?
- How should I know who the band is?


730
01:10:47.605 --> 01:10:49.539
It's just voices on a tape, man.

731
01:10:49.607 --> 01:10:52.542
To hell with voices on a tape.
We bring this to IA. That's it.


732
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.204
Pete, Linc's right.
They're not gonna believe it.


733
01:10:55.279 --> 01:10:59.375
Look. We can't trust anybody,
all right? It's just us.


734
01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:01.384
Oh, God.

735
01:11:04.321 --> 01:11:06.414
Okay, so... Then, wh...

736
01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:08.651
Sorry. What do you wanna do?

737
01:11:08.726 --> 01:11:10.660
I know where the rock manager lives.

738
01:11:10.728 --> 01:11:13.219
We have to find out when
and where it's happening.


739
01:11:13.297 --> 01:11:16.892
Fine. I'll go over there, I'll get tight
with them, and I'll find out something.


740
01:11:16.967 --> 01:11:20.733
You can't do that, 'cause if Billy's
there, you're dead. He can make us.


741
01:11:20.805 --> 01:11:22.739
I got Billy.

742
01:11:24.675 --> 01:11:27.906
- Are you sure?
- Anybody got a better idea?


743
01:11:27.978 --> 01:11:30.242
Then I got your back, Julie.

744
01:11:30.314 --> 01:11:31.906
All right.

745
01:11:31.982 --> 01:11:36.248
Leave a message at home and let us know
what's goin' on, all right?


746
01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.450
All right. Let's do it.

747
01:11:58.642 --> 01:12:01.202
Where you been? I called your house.
I called the club.


748
01:12:01.278 --> 01:12:03.769
- They said you're not working anymore.
- I quit.


749
01:12:05.983 --> 01:12:08.042
I'm not a very good waitress.

750
01:12:08.118 --> 01:12:10.951
What happened?
Did I do something wrong?


751
01:12:11.021 --> 01:12:15.321
No, everything's fine.
No, I was looking for you too.


752
01:12:15.392 --> 01:12:17.292
You were lookin' for me too?

753
01:12:17.361 --> 01:12:19.454
Yeah.

754
01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:22.124
Well, here I am.

755
01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:51.894
What?

756
01:12:51.962 --> 01:12:54.487
Says Billy sent him over.

757
01:12:54.565 --> 01:12:57.898
There. Sit down.
Oh, I'm so sorry about the mess.


758
01:12:57.968 --> 01:13:01.927
- I'm redecorating. Yeah?
- I know you told me to stay in there.


759
01:13:03.107 --> 01:13:04.699
Can I get a soda?

760
01:13:05.943 --> 01:13:08.673
- Soda. I'm thirsty.
- You're thirsty.


761
01:13:11.348 --> 01:13:14.078
I'm sorry.
My little baby is thirsty.


762
01:13:14.151 --> 01:13:16.085
Come here.

763
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:22.384
I'm sorry. This is not
gonna take very long, okay?


764
01:13:22.459 --> 01:13:26.088
All right. You go ahead.
You go get yourself a fuckin' sodie.


765
01:13:29.934 --> 01:13:31.629
Not bad, huh?

766
01:13:31.702 --> 01:13:34.500
You want a fuckin' sodie too?

767
01:13:34.572 --> 01:13:37.769
- I'm cool.
- Yes.


768
01:13:39.043 --> 01:13:41.637
Yes, you are.

769
01:13:42.546 --> 01:13:44.878
You are cool, aren't you?

770
01:13:48.352 --> 01:13:50.286
So?

771
01:13:51.188 --> 01:13:54.988
You're movin' a lot of shit.
Billy thought you might need some help.


772
01:13:58.796 --> 01:14:01.959
Sweet little Billy.
But nice to know he cares.


773
01:14:09.073 --> 01:14:11.007
Okay, now.

774
01:14:11.075 --> 01:14:13.168
If I'm out of line here,
you just let me know, okay?


775
01:14:13.243 --> 01:14:15.768
Or storm off or do whatever.

776
01:14:17.648 --> 01:14:19.582
I got us a room.

777
01:14:24.822 --> 01:14:26.983
Right on.

778
01:14:30.461 --> 01:14:32.452
- Could I borrow the phone?
- Sure.


779
01:14:32.529 --> 01:14:35.225
Just dial nine to get out.

780
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.320
- Leave a message after the beep.
- Hey, Linc, you didn't say our...


781
01:14:47.444 --> 01:14:51.210
- You have no messages.
- Thank you.


782
01:15:10.801 --> 01:15:12.598
Wanna dance?

783
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:15.400
What?

784
01:15:16.473 --> 01:15:17.735
Come on.

785
01:15:17.808 --> 01:15:19.742
Dance with me.

786
01:15:22.546 --> 01:15:24.480
I love this song.

787
01:15:25.983 --> 01:15:28.247
Come on.
It's just a little dance.


788
01:15:28.318 --> 01:15:30.980
I'm not a fag.
I just like to dance.


789
01:15:31.055 --> 01:15:35.151
Uh, you lead.
I'll be the girl. Yeah.


790
01:15:46.236 --> 01:15:49.171
I should get goin', man.
I got some business to handle.


791
01:15:49.239 --> 01:15:51.969
You're a classy dancer,
you know that?


792
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:55.341
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Wait a minute.

793
01:15:55.412 --> 01:15:57.346
I forgot. What's your name?

794
01:16:01.285 --> 01:16:03.344
Spin me, Linc.

795
01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.251
What?

796
01:16:05.322 --> 01:16:07.984
I said spin me.

797
01:16:17.901 --> 01:16:19.835
We could enter a contest.

798
01:16:22.439 --> 01:16:25.465
You can ride with us
in the morning, okay?


799
01:16:25.542 --> 01:16:27.476
Come on.

800
01:16:55.873 --> 01:16:58.341
Okay, I got it.
Agua Dulce Airport.


801
01:16:58.408 --> 01:17:00.740
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
Bob, she's fine.


802
01:17:00.811 --> 01:17:03.075
She doesn't know a thing.
Don't worry about it.


803
01:17:05.482 --> 01:17:07.416
You fuckin' woke her up, man.

804
01:18:03.974 --> 01:18:06.238
I didn't do him, okay?

805
01:18:13.717 --> 01:18:15.651
What about Linc?

806
01:18:17.588 --> 01:18:19.715
Oh, he didn't leave a message.

807
01:18:21.758 --> 01:18:23.783
We gotta go.

808
01:18:23.861 --> 01:18:25.829
Are you sure about that?

809
01:18:25.896 --> 01:18:28.364
I overheard him say that
on the phone in the bathroom.


810
01:18:28.432 --> 01:18:32.129
And that piece of paper I found
in his pants said Aqua Dulce Airport.


811
01:18:32.202 --> 01:18:34.830
Jesus. Dirty cops,
drops at the airport.


812
01:18:34.905 --> 01:18:37.931
I feel like one of us should say
we're gettin' too old for this shit.


813
01:18:38.008 --> 01:18:40.875
At least it's not goin' down
in an abandoned warehouse.


814
01:18:43.814 --> 01:18:45.748
Yeah.

815
01:18:57.995 --> 01:19:00.759
You gotta hear these guys.
They can really rock, man.


816
01:19:00.831 --> 01:19:02.992
I mean, this band
can rock and roll.


817
01:19:03.066 --> 01:19:05.000
These boys are the bomb.

818
01:19:31.295 --> 01:19:33.593
All right.
I'm gonna go make a phone call.


819
01:19:33.664 --> 01:19:35.894
- What?
- Just stay here, all right?


820
01:19:42.839 --> 01:19:45.273
Let's go greet the fuckin' kids.

821
01:19:49.746 --> 01:19:52.579
Be nice to the boys, okay?

822
01:19:55.919 --> 01:20:00.185
- Hey! Kevin, how are you, baby?
- Howie!


823
01:20:00.257 --> 01:20:03.522
Hey, Kirk! Kris, how you doin', babe?
How are you?


824
01:20:03.593 --> 01:20:06.494
Oh, come on! Will ya pl...

825
01:20:06.563 --> 01:20:11.865
Hey, will you turn down the tunes
a scootch, please? Thanks. Listen, boys.


826
01:20:13.303 --> 01:20:15.237
Big people got some biz here.

827
01:20:15.305 --> 01:20:17.671
So why don't you hop into the limo...

828
01:20:17.741 --> 01:20:20.209
scoot over to the hotel,
we'll catch up with you later.


829
01:20:20.277 --> 01:20:23.974
- Come on. Can't we stay with you?
- Come on. Be good, boys.


830
01:20:24.047 --> 01:20:26.481
- We won't do anything.
- Give us a hug. Come on.


831
01:20:29.252 --> 01:20:32.346
- Go ahead. Go!
- Bye!


832
01:20:32.422 --> 01:20:33.855
See you at the hotel.

833
01:20:33.924 --> 01:20:36.552
- Don't be long.
- We missed you.


834
01:21:11.161 --> 01:21:13.095
Where the hell is that schmuck?

835
01:21:14.898 --> 01:21:17.924
Where'd you go?

836
01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:20.435
I called for backup.

837
01:21:20.504 --> 01:21:22.233
- What's goin' on?
- Linc's inside.


838
01:21:25.842 --> 01:21:28.936
God, that almost is
an abandoned warehouse.


839
01:21:29.012 --> 01:21:31.446
I'm gettin' too old for this shit.

840
01:21:58.175 --> 01:22:01.633
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.


841
01:22:01.711 --> 01:22:04.612
Oh, God. Okay.

842
01:22:09.052 --> 01:22:11.987
- Hey, you guys got a bathroom in here?
- Over there.


843
01:22:29.005 --> 01:22:31.838
- You're late.
- Sorry. I had to rent a car, man.


844
01:22:31.908 --> 01:22:34.308
Someone stole mine
from your party the other night.


845
01:22:34.377 --> 01:22:37.403
What do we do?

846
01:22:39.182 --> 01:22:40.877
- Let's go.
- What? Where?


847
01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:43.283
Get the car. Come on. Let's go.

848
01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:51.518
- Oh, God.
- You want me to drive?


849
01:22:51.595 --> 01:22:53.995
No. Linc wouldn't want you
driving his car.


850
01:22:59.169 --> 01:23:02.036
So, do we do this now...

851
01:23:02.105 --> 01:23:04.835
or do we wait for your boyfriend
to come out of the toilet?


852
01:23:06.209 --> 01:23:07.767
What?

853
01:23:09.713 --> 01:23:13.979
Your fella. He's a good dancer.

854
01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:19.215
Dancer? I don't know no dancer.
Are you serious?


855
01:23:22.225 --> 01:23:24.887
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.


856
01:23:24.961 --> 01:23:29.295
Uh-huh. No, brother's not with me.

857
01:23:30.367 --> 01:23:32.733
- He's a cop.
- What?


858
01:23:35.105 --> 01:23:38.074
- Stop messin' around.
- You'll know when I am. He's a cop!


859
01:23:38.141 --> 01:23:39.802
- Police!
- Freeze!


860
01:23:39.876 --> 01:23:42.401
- Drop the weapons!
- Drop 'em!


861
01:23:42.479 --> 01:23:44.413
- Right now! Drop 'em!
- Put 'em down!


862
01:23:44.481 --> 01:23:46.142
Down!

863
01:23:46.216 --> 01:23:47.649
Drop 'em! Get 'em out of here!

864
01:23:47.717 --> 01:23:50.652
- Come on, big man.
- Hey, this is fucked up.


865
01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.984
Faster.

866
01:23:56.092 --> 01:23:57.719
Teamwork.

867
01:23:57.794 --> 01:24:01.821
Let's go. Get out of here.
You too, home skillet.


868
01:24:01.898 --> 01:24:03.923
On the wall.

869
01:24:06.369 --> 01:24:07.996
Spread 'em!

870
01:24:11.841 --> 01:24:13.775
You dead, boy.

871
01:24:22.185 --> 01:24:23.846
Stop!

872
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.410
Is that Eckford?

873
01:24:25.488 --> 01:24:28.252
- He better move.
- Right on.


874
01:24:34.864 --> 01:24:36.297
- Jump!
- What?


875
01:24:36.366 --> 01:24:38.493
Jump!

876
01:24:38.568 --> 01:24:41.935
- Oh, my God! My ankle!
- Get away from the door!


877
01:25:19.442 --> 01:25:22.536
Hey, kid, I don't think
you're gonna make it.


878
01:25:33.156 --> 01:25:35.590
- Fuck this fair fighting shit.
- Okay.


879
01:26:11.494 --> 01:26:13.086
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.


880
01:26:13.163 --> 01:26:14.630
Gotta go.

881
01:26:14.698 --> 01:26:16.393
I got a plan.

882
01:26:32.782 --> 01:26:34.716
Does this mean
you're mad at me again?


883
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:42.423
You gonna kill him?

884
01:26:44.327 --> 01:26:45.760
No, I'm done.

885
01:26:56.673 --> 01:26:58.800
Hey, what are you doing, huh?

886
01:26:58.875 --> 01:27:00.986
I've got nothing to do with drugs.
I'm in the music business!


887
01:27:01.010 --> 01:27:05.208
Hey, get this place taped off. You're
standing around like crossing guards.


888
01:27:14.791 --> 01:27:18.818
- Save me a dance, lover.
- What happened, Detective?


889
01:27:18.895 --> 01:27:23.389
Well, sir. We were bustin' 'em, and
these kids came in and tried to stop us.


890
01:27:23.466 --> 01:27:25.457
- That's bullshit.
- They tried to stop you?


891
01:27:25.535 --> 01:27:27.867
Yes, sir. Probably in on it too.

892
01:27:27.937 --> 01:27:31.134
- They set this up.
- They stole drugs from the evidence.


893
01:27:31.207 --> 01:27:34.472
- That's enough. Get 'em out of here.
- They killed Greer. He was onto them.


894
01:27:34.544 --> 01:27:35.875
Ask him.

895
01:27:37.847 --> 01:27:40.372
I have no idea
what she's talking about.


896
01:27:40.450 --> 01:27:41.610
Ask him.

897
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:51.718
Right before Billy hands over the cash,
we roll in and make the bust, okay?


898
01:27:51.795 --> 01:27:56.198
- Where are we gonna get that money?
- Carl, there is no money, okay?


899
01:27:56.266 --> 01:27:59.827
It's an empty bag.
We bust in before Billy hands it over.


900
01:27:59.903 --> 01:28:02.098
Anybody have any questions?
It's all pretty easy.


901
01:28:02.172 --> 01:28:04.766
We grab the drugs,
pretend to arrest Billy...


902
01:28:04.841 --> 01:28:08.208
next day he's out moving
the stuff for us, okay?


903
01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.605
Yeah, Bob!

904
01:28:17.353 --> 01:28:19.844
Assume the position.

905
01:28:22.425 --> 01:28:24.359
Assume it.

906
01:28:30.733 --> 01:28:32.667
You all right?

907
01:28:33.736 --> 01:28:36.899
- Yeah, are you?
- Yeah.


908
01:28:36.973 --> 01:28:38.406
You?

909
01:28:40.643 --> 01:28:42.235
Yeah.

910
01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.548
Nice work.

911
01:28:46.616 --> 01:28:48.743
Thank you.

912
01:28:48.818 --> 01:28:51.286
So you kids are what...

913
01:28:51.354 --> 01:28:53.879
some kind of "mod squad"
or something?


914
01:29:05.768 --> 01:29:08.999
They say we're back on
if we want.


915
01:29:09.072 --> 01:29:12.701
- Yes.
- Won't be the same without Greer.


916
01:29:16.746 --> 01:29:18.680
What else we got?

917
01:29:23.086 --> 01:29:26.351
- So what? Are we in or...
- Right on.


918
01:29:27.991 --> 01:29:29.424
Solid.

919
01:29:33.363 --> 01:29:36.230
Oh, Linc, dude.
I know a guy down in Torrance...


920
01:29:36.299 --> 01:29:39.325
who is, like, the straight up wizard
of bondo.


921
01:29:39.402 --> 01:29:41.734
- And I'm sure he could fix up the car...
- Shut up, Pete.


922
01:29:41.804 --> 01:29:44.898
No, wait. I'm serious, dude.
No, this guy's like a bondo king.


923
01:29:44.974 --> 01:29:48.239
I'm sure he can slap that Lincoln
together in no time, right?


924
01:29:48.311 --> 01:29:50.871
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call my lawyer friend...


925
01:29:50.947 --> 01:29:55.816
to file a lawsuit against those guys
or the city or somebody, right?
