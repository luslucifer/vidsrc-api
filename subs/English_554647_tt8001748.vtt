1
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.216
Hey, stop messing around.

2
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.300
Hey, Kayu.

3
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.008
Hush, I'm at the final stage.

4
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.764
I just need to gather weapons,

5
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.333
throw the smoke bomb,
kill the boss,


6
00:03:39.425 --> 00:03:41.175
head shot, helicopter rescue,

7
00:03:41.383 --> 00:03:42.383
and I'll win.

8
00:03:43.216 --> 00:03:44.295
Quick, keep your handphone.

9
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.500
Don't get me into trouble.

10
00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:46.675
Wait, wait, wait.

11
00:03:57.841 --> 00:03:59.341
It froze?

12
00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:02.258
This camp's signal reception is so poor.

13
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:04.383
We must book out.

14
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.341
Corporal Tan Kayu, 
Corporal Tazan.

15
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:10.591
Damn it, what the hell are you doing?

16
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.250
Even your mothers know that everyone

17
00:04:12.258 --> 00:04:14.758
is supposed to stand at attention
when they hear the anthem!


18
00:04:15.508 --> 00:04:17.068
Chit-chatting during guard duty, right?

19
00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:18.633
What is this?

20
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:22.050
Playing games? Well done!

21
00:04:22.175 --> 00:04:23.575
Regimental Sergeant Major's orders,

22
00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:26.366
All mobile phones are banned
during this in-camp training.


23
00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:28.800
Bro, chill man.

24
00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:30.133
We aren't recruits anymore.

25
00:04:30.258 --> 00:04:31.458
Who's your bro?

26
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:33.591
Oh, what is this?

27
00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:35.466
Not giving respect to your wife?

28
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:37.050
Do you want me to charge you?

29
00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:38.925
I told you before,

30
00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:41.334
my upper limbs are excused from duty,
I can't hold rifles.


31
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:43.091
In fact, I'm a non-combat clerk.

32
00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:44.317
I shouldn't be doing guard duty.

33
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:45.841
If your upper limbs are excused,

34
00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:48.258
don't let me catch you eating, drinking,

35
00:04:48.383 --> 00:04:49.382
or wiping your ass
with your hands, understand?


36
00:04:49.383 --> 00:04:51.425
Carrying rifle makes my hands feel sore

37
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.502
and it will tremble.

38
00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:55.341
Tan Kayu, you are the laziest,

39
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:56.859
most unfit, and the weakest soldier

40
00:04:56.883 --> 00:04:58.443
I have ever known since basic training!

41
00:05:01.675 --> 00:05:03.383
Have you counted your bullets?

42
00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:04.958
Five bullets.

43
00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:06.133
You better don't lose them.

44
00:05:06.383 --> 00:05:07.591
You will be charged.

45
00:05:07.883 --> 00:05:10.317
Guard duty is the only time
you have live ammunition with you.


46
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:11.859
You have to take care of
your standard issue items properly,


47
00:05:11.883 --> 00:05:12.883
understand?

48
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.980
Where are your field bandages and ID tags?

49
00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:19.216
What ID tag?

50
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.300
Don't be crazy,

51
00:05:23.383 --> 00:05:24.675
but only recruits have ID tags.

52
00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:27.466
We are veterans,
we have lost our tags long ago.


53
00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:31.216
How are you going to fight a war
without your ID tags?


54
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.901
How is your mother going to know that

55
00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:34.258
it is you, when
you die in a war?

56
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.216
Maybe something must happen to you

57
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:38.026
for you to get a clue
on what's going on, right?


58
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.591
Our country is very safe,

59
00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:41.133
why would a war happen here?

60
00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:42.383
If anything happens,

61
00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:43.547
with one nuclear bomb,

62
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.841
boom!

63
00:05:45.508 --> 00:05:46.925
The whole island will be destroyed.

64
00:05:47.925 --> 00:05:48.925
Let us book out, please.

65
00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:52.925
If I let you go,
who will do guard duty then?


66
00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:55.133
The whole unit has gone outfield.

67
00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:57.925
Let me tell you,
our mission is to protect the camp.


68
00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:04.300
Damn it, you want
to play punk with me?

69
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.330
Knock it down, push-up position.

70
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.442
Sergeant, we are here for reservist,

71
00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:10.716
we don't do this anymore.

72
00:06:10.883 --> 00:06:13.508
Damn it, you want
to play games with me?

73
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:15.675
Mount the chin-up bar,

74
00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:17.508
now!

75
00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:20.925
Hey, bro.

76
00:06:21.008 --> 00:06:21.841
Chin-ups are not

77
00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:23.216
in the fitness test anymore.

78
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.425
How can we test your strength
without chin-ups?


79
00:06:25.758 --> 00:06:27.638
Let's see how fit you are
after all these years.


80
00:06:34.925 --> 00:06:35.966
Corporal,

81
00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:37.758
you can't even complete one chin-up.

82
00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:40.675
Even your mother can do better than you,
understand?


83
00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:46.175
Your father.

84
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:47.401
What's wrong with my father?

85
00:06:47.425 --> 00:06:49.216
Your father is here!

86
00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:54.466
Sergeant Lee!

87
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:57.300
Crawling through the battlefield
makes the grass dance!


88
00:06:57.591 --> 00:06:58.800
Not tactical at all!

89
00:06:59.216 --> 00:07:00.925
Why didn't you man the gate properly?

90
00:07:01.216 --> 00:07:03.925
A few men returned from outfield,

91
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.675
and gave us a bunch of excuses.

92
00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:07.966
Broken legs, broken arms,

93
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:10.008
headache, stomachache, diarrhoea!

94
00:07:10.758 --> 00:07:12.383
Make sure you take the headcount.

95
00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:14.133
Yes, dad.

96
00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:15.466
I've told you,

97
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:17.008
while you're in camp, call me sir!

98
00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:18.133
Yes, sir!

99
00:07:18.425 --> 00:07:19.734
Yesterday, there was this joker who

100
00:07:19.758 --> 00:07:22.466
wore his underwear like a helmet
and danced like a monkey.


101
00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:24.841
There were videos taken,
and they were put online!


102
00:07:25.258 --> 00:07:27.050
Make sure that you collect

103
00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:28.734
their mobile phones, and lock them all up!

104
00:07:28.758 --> 00:07:30.800
This is a top-secret camp.

105
00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:32.675
All these punks, they come back

106
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:34.080
for reservist duty only once a year.

107
00:07:34.091 --> 00:07:35.175
They have no clue!

108
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.300
Yes sir!

109
00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:38.091
I'm going to book out now.

110
00:07:38.383 --> 00:07:40.383
The entire battalion is outfield.

111
00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:43.341
Make sure you do your job,
and defend the camp.


112
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:44.966
Don't embarrass me.

113
00:07:45.216 --> 00:07:47.175
Yes sir, I will make sure
my men do their job!


114
00:07:48.258 --> 00:07:50.591
What are the eight
core values of the army?

115
00:07:50.883 --> 00:07:52.300
Loyalty to country,

116
00:07:52.758 --> 00:07:53.758
leadership,

117
00:07:53.966 --> 00:07:55.841
discipline, professionalism,

118
00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:58.258
fighting spirit, ethics, safety...

119
00:07:58.383 --> 00:08:00.216
Bully the soldiers!

120
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:02.675
This Sergeant Lee Siao On
is very outstanding.


121
00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:04.484
Basic training, best in his company.

122
00:08:04.508 --> 00:08:05.841
Sergeant course, 
Golden Bayonet,

123
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:08.234
army half marathon, fitness tests,
obstacle courses.


124
00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:09.401
He holds the record for everything.

125
00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:11.175
Also, I heard his Operation Blue Bird

126
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.359
was very impressive.

127
00:08:12.383 --> 00:08:13.841
It's Blue Bridge.

128
00:08:14.341 --> 00:08:15.741
All these operations are useless,

129
00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:16.883
it's only for show.

130
00:08:17.008 --> 00:08:18.008
These type of people,

131
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.410
they only know to sign on to the army
and follow the system.


132
00:08:20.758 --> 00:08:23.133
If they are working in the real world,
they won't survive.


133
00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:24.776
He wants me to call him Sergeant?

134
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.800
No way!

135
00:08:26.258 --> 00:08:28.218
Is this really the shortcut
to the medical centre?


136
00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.192
Yes.

137
00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:30.633
You know this camp well.

138
00:08:31.216 --> 00:08:32.256
If you didn't go outfield,

139
00:08:32.341 --> 00:08:33.883
you don't want people to see you.

140
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.425
I always move around tactically,

141
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.390
especially from here
to canteen to eat burgers.


142
00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:38.716
This camp is so big,

143
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:40.175
I haven't finished exploring.

144
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.300
But I'm not sure,

145
00:08:41.383 --> 00:08:42.583
what if we get caught?

146
00:08:43.216 --> 00:08:44.591
Act blur, live longer.

147
00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:47.675
Act stupid, live forever.

148
00:08:48.091 --> 00:08:49.966
I think I'm not going to report sick.

149
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.526
I'm just going to stay inside here
and slack, it's better.


150
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.216
Take a break from my day job.

151
00:08:54.466 --> 00:08:55.692
Why don't you go report sick with me?

152
00:08:55.716 --> 00:08:57.383
We can go to the canteen together.

153
00:08:57.716 --> 00:08:59.156
There are pretty girls there, right?

154
00:09:00.341 --> 00:09:01.341
What about your weapon?

155
00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:03.186
You can't bring it into the medical centre.

156
00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:09.341
I'll just hide it here.

157
00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:12.133
You are really a thinking soldier.

158
00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:14.841
It's Nathan and Tony.

159
00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:17.675
They are on patrol duty.

160
00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:21.583
If we don't malinger,

161
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:22.800
we will not have freedom.

162
00:09:23.008 --> 00:09:24.050
Let's book out!

163
00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:39.675
Wow.

164
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.300
I think we are late man.

165
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.692
So many people reporting sick

166
00:09:42.716 --> 00:09:43.956
and avoiding outfield training.

167
00:09:54.675 --> 00:09:55.675
Chua.

168
00:09:56.758 --> 00:09:57.858
We want to report sick.

169
00:09:59.675 --> 00:10:01.758
Slacker buddy Tan Kayu!

170
00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:02.925
Chua the player.

171
00:10:04.883 --> 00:10:05.966
You finally show your face.

172
00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:08.056
I thought you're always hiding
in the barracks.


173
00:10:08.466 --> 00:10:10.008
Oh no, I'm not hiding...

174
00:10:10.133 --> 00:10:13.258
We were assigned to guard duty.

175
00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:14.925
That's tiring.

176
00:10:15.008 --> 00:10:17.109
Unlike the good old days,
when we were clerks on duty,


177
00:10:17.133 --> 00:10:18.234
we used to stay in the ops room

178
00:10:18.258 --> 00:10:19.692
with air con, answering phone calls,

179
00:10:19.716 --> 00:10:21.758
drinking coffee and watching television.

180
00:10:21.883 --> 00:10:22.883
So relaxing!

181
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.648
If we don't malinger,

182
00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:26.166
we will not have freedom.

183
00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:29.675
Can you let us skip the queue?

184
00:10:30.133 --> 00:10:31.133
What's your problem?

185
00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:35.526
I'm excused from using my upper limbs,

186
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.190
but my commander forced me to do chin-ups

187
00:10:37.258 --> 00:10:38.538
and I fell down and hurt myself.

188
00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:40.396
I also had fever and diarrhoea last night.

189
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800
Wow.

190
00:10:42.383 --> 00:10:43.383
How about you?

191
00:10:44.883 --> 00:10:45.966
I have depression.

192
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.716
You guys have to queue up.

193
00:10:52.883 --> 00:10:54.550
It's not that easy to get medical leave.

194
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.883
Look at the people behind.

195
00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:57.466
Excused lower limbs,

196
00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:59.050
excused upper limbs,

197
00:10:59.216 --> 00:11:00.228
fall down,

198
00:11:00.258 --> 00:11:00.758
fever,

199
00:11:00.883 --> 00:11:01.383
diarrhoea,

200
00:11:01.508 --> 00:11:02.716
depression.

201
00:11:03.925 --> 00:11:06.133
I want to book out to spend time
with my family too.


202
00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:08.633
Look at my daughter,

203
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:10.941
she's having a piano presentation today.

204
00:11:11.591 --> 00:11:13.258
Marksman Chua, you are a lucky guy.

205
00:11:13.383 --> 00:11:15.223
Are you talking about his wife
or his daughter?


206
00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:21.341
I mean Chua is generally a lucky guy.

207
00:11:23.758 --> 00:11:26.425
Just messing with you, why so serious?

208
00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:36.008
We should avoid troubling Captain Yap.

209
00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:38.341
If he complains to his father,

210
00:11:38.466 --> 00:11:39.508
I can't go home.

211
00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:40.633
Who's his father?

212
00:11:42.341 --> 00:11:44.758
His father is an important figure.

213
00:11:45.383 --> 00:11:47.050
Some sort of Senior Minister

214
00:11:47.175 --> 00:11:48.633
works in parliament

215
00:11:48.758 --> 00:11:50.300
in charge of defence.

216
00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:51.045
Huh?

217
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.410
I don't know what he does exactly.

218
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.883
Do not mess with him.

219
00:11:54.091 --> 00:11:55.090
He's the only one in camp

220
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:56.090
who can park his car inside here.

221
00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:57.216
I can't even park in here.

222
00:11:58.216 --> 00:12:00.550
What are you doing here? Are you sick?

223
00:12:02.425 --> 00:12:04.091
No fever, and you look fit.

224
00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:06.591
Oh no, I'm here for my friend.

225
00:12:06.716 --> 00:12:07.836
His upper limbs are injured.

226
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.109
- What?
- Although you are not handsome,


227
00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:12.175
you are a good boy.

228
00:12:12.508 --> 00:12:14.668
Drop by my canteen anytime,
I will buy you a few drinks


229
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.800
or some beer!

230
00:12:17.133 --> 00:12:18.008
- Thank you Auntie.
- Hey!


231
00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:18.925
I mean Susie, Susie.

232
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.841
Call me Susie. Don't forget,

233
00:12:21.383 --> 00:12:22.633
I was once in Miss Singapore,

234
00:12:22.758 --> 00:12:23.508
Miss Universe,

235
00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:25.466
Miss Tourism, and also

236
00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.216
Miss Chinatown.

237
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:28.466
Never forget!

238
00:12:28.591 --> 00:12:30.511
Where are you carrying these boxes to?
Need help?


239
00:12:31.883 --> 00:12:33.243
It's alright, my daughter is here.

240
00:13:28.383 --> 00:13:29.383
Are you shy?

241
00:13:33.175 --> 00:13:35.925
Damn it, stupid camp,
so many mosquitoes here.


242
00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:40.966
You're applying too much,
this repellent is very effective!


243
00:13:41.091 --> 00:13:42.091
We are out of stock.

244
00:13:42.175 --> 00:13:43.258
Our neighbour...

245
00:13:43.633 --> 00:13:44.713
Where's our cute neighbour?

246
00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:46.925
Which jerk?

247
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.883
Why are you so crude?
No wonder no guy wants you.


248
00:13:50.216 --> 00:13:53.675
Please, these are all old men
and uncles here,


249
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.050
I'm not even interested.
I'm going out in a while.


250
00:13:56.175 --> 00:13:58.375
You're always giving excuses
when I ask you to help out.


251
00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.734
Do you know that when you are around,
my business is better.


252
00:14:00.758 --> 00:14:01.883
We'll be rich!

253
00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:04.091
In life we shouldn't just
think about ourselves.


254
00:14:04.466 --> 00:14:06.216
I have a life outside.

255
00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:07.091
Wait,

256
00:14:07.341 --> 00:14:10.050
take this to the white horse Captain Yap.

257
00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:11.341
Let him sign the invoice.

258
00:14:11.466 --> 00:14:12.508
I'll be at the canteen.

259
00:14:14.425 --> 00:14:15.216
Your neighbour?

260
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:16.216
Yes, yes.

261
00:14:16.341 --> 00:14:17.442
Why didn't you mention that earlier?

262
00:14:17.466 --> 00:14:19.966
Let's go to your place next week.

263
00:14:21.841 --> 00:14:22.841
Hi.

264
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.800
What do you want?

265
00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:30.651
Xiao Ling, I'll borrow this, thank you!

266
00:14:30.883 --> 00:14:31.883
Hey!

267
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.300
Rub this into our eyes,
our eyes will turn reddish.


268
00:14:34.716 --> 00:14:35.591
We will look very sick,

269
00:14:35.716 --> 00:14:36.996
they will let us jump the queue.

270
00:14:37.258 --> 00:14:38.050
Are you sure?

271
00:14:38.175 --> 00:14:39.841
You will not just get medical leave,

272
00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:41.841
but immediate discharge from the army!

273
00:14:42.133 --> 00:14:43.466
I'm very sure.

274
00:14:52.133 --> 00:14:53.633
Can you help me take off my glasses?

275
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.550
Oh my!

276
00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:12.341
Bloody hell! What are you guys doing?

277
00:15:17.175 --> 00:15:18.758
Sir, don't fall for his tricks.

278
00:15:18.883 --> 00:15:20.363
I want to charge him for malingering.

279
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.383
This looks serious.

280
00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:23.966
Conjunctivitis.

281
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:26.550
OK, I will give you medical leave.

282
00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:27.675
Please go home and rest.

283
00:15:27.758 --> 00:15:28.550
Thank you sir.

284
00:15:28.675 --> 00:15:29.550
But sir, this bugger...

285
00:15:29.675 --> 00:15:30.675
Sergeant.

286
00:15:31.258 --> 00:15:33.008
Are you aware, that the cornea

287
00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:35.675
is connected via optic nerves to the brain,

288
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.550
which is then connected to the spinal cord?

289
00:15:37.716 --> 00:15:39.466
An eye infection like this,

290
00:15:39.591 --> 00:15:41.550
could lead to brain tumour, aneurysm,

291
00:15:41.675 --> 00:15:43.925
or even to paralysis of the entire body.

292
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.675
Sir, I think he is malingering.

293
00:15:45.925 --> 00:15:47.966
Sergeant, you think, I thought,

294
00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:49.091
who confirm?

295
00:15:49.258 --> 00:15:51.425
And Sergeant, are you aware
that Corporal Tan


296
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.383
is excused for upper limbs?

297
00:15:53.508 --> 00:15:54.966
And he has a pending downgrade

298
00:15:55.091 --> 00:15:57.466
for lower limb, excuse boots,

299
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:58.675
and he has a back problem.

300
00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.276
Why do you need to punish him?

301
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.567
Don't you know
there is already a viral infection


302
00:16:01.591 --> 00:16:02.716
spreading around this camp?

303
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:04.841
Yes, I know. CK virus.

304
00:16:06.258 --> 00:16:07.091
CK virus?

305
00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:08.258
Confirmed Kidding Virus.

306
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.300
Sergeant, my job is to ensure that

307
00:16:14.425 --> 00:16:18.383
everyone finishes this in-camp training
in one piece.


308
00:16:19.175 --> 00:16:20.841
We all have lives outside.

309
00:16:21.133 --> 00:16:22.925
Nobody wants to waste their time here.

310
00:16:23.133 --> 00:16:24.675
Regardless whether you are a soldier,

311
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.758
a commander, or a captain.

312
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800
Chua, am I right?

313
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.591
Yes sir.

314
00:16:30.716 --> 00:16:32.196
Don't let this sergeant override you.

315
00:16:32.258 --> 00:16:35.133
What the hell,
I don't care who is overriding,


316
00:16:35.383 --> 00:16:37.258
or who is malingering.

317
00:16:37.925 --> 00:16:40.050
Here's your order,
can you sign this for me now?


318
00:16:42.966 --> 00:16:44.383
This is a restricted area.

319
00:16:45.508 --> 00:16:46.550
Charge me then!

320
00:16:46.841 --> 00:16:48.300
Sir! There's an emergency!

321
00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:49.675
There's a man down, sir!

322
00:17:02.383 --> 00:17:03.841
Sir, another one faking it.

323
00:17:14.341 --> 00:17:15.883
Does anyone know how to carry out CPR?

324
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:21.133
Medic, administer CPR, now!

325
00:17:21.258 --> 00:17:21.758
Me?

326
00:17:21.883 --> 00:17:23.758
Of course it's you,
you have the armband.


327
00:17:32.466 --> 00:17:34.966
One, and two, and three, and four...

328
00:17:35.091 --> 00:17:36.800
and five.

329
00:17:37.175 --> 00:17:39.800
One, and two, and three, and four...

330
00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:40.925
and ten.

331
00:17:41.216 --> 00:17:42.341
One, and two...

332
00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:43.300
Sir, I've forgotten how to do it.

333
00:17:43.425 --> 00:17:44.550
Mouth to mouth! Continue!

334
00:17:45.466 --> 00:17:46.675
Mouth to mouth! Hurry up!

335
00:18:12.966 --> 00:18:13.966
Oh my god

336
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.050
Move it!

337
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:46.091
Kayu?

338
00:19:47.216 --> 00:19:48.216
Kayu!

339
00:20:36.925 --> 00:20:38.216
Beauty, are you okay?

340
00:20:40.091 --> 00:20:40.966
Get in there!

341
00:20:41.091 --> 00:20:42.175
No, it's too small!

342
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.300
Get in there!

343
00:20:44.925 --> 00:20:46.341
- Ah!
- Sorry!


344
00:20:46.466 --> 00:20:47.550
Damn you!

345
00:21:39.091 --> 00:21:39.791
Corporal!

346
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.840
Don't just stand and look!

347
00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:42.633
Help me out!

348
00:21:57.216 --> 00:21:58.328
What's going on?

349
00:21:58.508 --> 00:21:59.508
I don't know...

350
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.300
Did you see Tazan just now?

351
00:22:01.675 --> 00:22:02.675
No...

352
00:22:05.716 --> 00:22:07.466
Hey! Why didn't you help me just now?

353
00:22:13.133 --> 00:22:14.550
Beauty is still in the cabinet.

354
00:22:15.258 --> 00:22:16.758
Why do they start biting people?

355
00:22:24.133 --> 00:22:24.965
Were you bitten?

356
00:22:24.966 --> 00:22:26.508
No! Maybe you were bitten!

357
00:22:27.966 --> 00:22:28.966
Your eyes are reddish.

358
00:22:29.341 --> 00:22:30.741
It's because of the mosquito...

359
00:22:31.508 --> 00:22:34.508
No, I mean...

360
00:22:35.258 --> 00:22:36.257
I have conjunctivitis...

361
00:22:36.258 --> 00:22:37.191
I've told the medical officer.

362
00:22:37.216 --> 00:22:38.216
Corporal.

363
00:22:38.633 --> 00:22:39.931
Knock it down. 
Push-up position.

364
00:22:39.966 --> 00:22:41.300
Are you crazy? For what?

365
00:22:41.466 --> 00:22:42.866
I'm not a recruit anymore.

366
00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.133
OK, you're normal.

367
00:22:56.466 --> 00:22:57.340
What are you doing?

368
00:22:57.341 --> 00:22:58.340
Black tape. Protecting myself.

369
00:22:58.341 --> 00:22:59.341
Pass some to me.

370
00:23:00.466 --> 00:23:01.466
There's none left.

371
00:23:02.216 --> 00:23:03.656
Where are your standard issue items?

372
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:04.925
Why don't you use your own?

373
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.050
I don't have it now.

374
00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:46.216
He's infected.

375
00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:48.216
Soldier, relax.

376
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.550
Corporal!

377
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.800
Help me out!

378
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.300
I have rope!

379
00:24:53.591 --> 00:24:54.591
Give it to me.

380
00:24:55.008 --> 00:24:56.648
This is only for internal communications.

381
00:25:01.758 --> 00:25:02.800
No connection.

382
00:25:03.758 --> 00:25:05.216
Stupid camp.

383
00:25:06.341 --> 00:25:07.421
Do you have a mobile phone?

384
00:25:07.466 --> 00:25:08.050
Yes.

385
00:25:08.258 --> 00:25:09.258
Give it to me.

386
00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:10.800
It was confiscated by you.

387
00:25:11.258 --> 00:25:12.258
Damn it.

388
00:25:12.341 --> 00:25:14.216
I locked mobile phones in the guard house.

389
00:25:17.008 --> 00:25:18.425
I was just following RSM's orders.

390
00:25:19.091 --> 00:25:20.276
I see, you're just following orders.

391
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.140
I thought you were opening
a mobile phone shop.


392
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:26.050
What do we do now?

393
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.925
It's impossible.

394
00:25:29.716 --> 00:25:30.716
They are turning into...

395
00:25:32.175 --> 00:25:32.966
Into what?

396
00:25:33.175 --> 00:25:34.175
Turning into...

397
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.050
Turning into what?

398
00:25:36.466 --> 00:25:37.508
Turning into crazies.

399
00:25:38.925 --> 00:25:40.365
We need to find out what's going on.

400
00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.716
Follow protocol, contact all key personnel.

401
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.175
But RSM isn't here.

402
00:25:46.466 --> 00:25:48.317
All the other officers are outfield
in the forest.


403
00:25:48.341 --> 00:25:50.008
Who's the key personnel left?

404
00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:53.675
Shit. I think it's me.

405
00:25:55.341 --> 00:25:56.817
Then your dream has come true,
you can take it over


406
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:57.925
acting RSM.

407
00:25:59.841 --> 00:26:00.925
There's a virus.

408
00:26:01.591 --> 00:26:02.925
Crazy virus.

409
00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.800
Corporal, on the count of three,

410
00:26:07.216 --> 00:26:08.966
we barge out there to rescue Beauty!

411
00:26:09.091 --> 00:26:10.091
Wait.

412
00:26:10.383 --> 00:26:12.216
Where can we go after we saved her?

413
00:26:13.091 --> 00:26:15.383
I think we should stay here
and wait for backup.


414
00:26:15.508 --> 00:26:17.091
Hello? I'm your sergeant!

415
00:26:17.216 --> 00:26:18.591
You follow my orders, understand?

416
00:26:20.383 --> 00:26:21.383
Don't be so reckless.

417
00:26:24.216 --> 00:26:25.216
I have an idea.

418
00:26:35.341 --> 00:26:36.883
Are you crazy? 
What are you doing?

419
00:27:24.216 --> 00:27:25.883
Did you see Tazan just now?

420
00:27:26.258 --> 00:27:27.258
What do you think?

421
00:27:45.383 --> 00:27:46.383
Let's go to the HQ block.

422
00:27:52.008 --> 00:27:53.008
To the canteen!

423
00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:57.091
We're finished.

424
00:28:00.883 --> 00:28:01.883
Land Rover.

425
00:28:21.175 --> 00:28:22.258
Find the car keys.

426
00:28:25.883 --> 00:28:26.883
There are no car keys.

427
00:28:32.508 --> 00:28:33.925
Beauty, were you bitten?

428
00:28:36.258 --> 00:28:36.925
How about you?

429
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.050
Maybe you were bitten.

430
00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.416
Wow, what's wrong with your...

431
00:28:39.758 --> 00:28:41.050
I'm not bitten!

432
00:28:41.633 --> 00:28:43.300
I was hit in
the face by someone though.

433
00:28:43.425 --> 00:28:44.758
Here, I have bandages.

434
00:28:47.383 --> 00:28:48.508
What should we do now?

435
00:28:49.133 --> 00:28:50.973
We should wait for
the government to rescue us.


436
00:28:51.383 --> 00:28:52.383
When I play games,

437
00:28:52.841 --> 00:28:54.641
they'll always send a helicopter
to rescue us.


438
00:28:55.383 --> 00:28:56.883
Can you wake up?

439
00:28:57.841 --> 00:29:00.466
According to protocol,
we should contact HQ.


440
00:29:01.258 --> 00:29:04.175
Can you stop following protocol
and use your brains?


441
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.425
My mom is still at the canteen,

442
00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.508
I don't know if she's ok.
I need to find her.


443
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:12.351
Maybe your friend escaped
to the canteen too.


444
00:29:17.966 --> 00:29:18.675
What are you doing?

445
00:29:18.883 --> 00:29:19.925
Jump-start the engine.

446
00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:20.925
Are you sure you
know how to do it?

447
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.258
They always do this in movies.

448
00:29:22.883 --> 00:29:24.466
Stupid.

449
00:29:36.716 --> 00:29:37.716
The storeman...

450
00:29:56.216 --> 00:29:57.256
I have to look for my mom.

451
00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.091
No, we should head to HQ first.

452
00:29:59.216 --> 00:30:01.675
We should have a plan before taking action.

453
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.633
Wait!

454
00:30:02.758 --> 00:30:05.633
OK, let's save the lady first
before we head to the HQ.


455
00:30:05.758 --> 00:30:06.508
Who's the lady?

456
00:30:06.633 --> 00:30:07.633
Your mother, Susie.

457
00:30:07.758 --> 00:30:08.466
Let's go!

458
00:30:08.591 --> 00:30:09.591
Wait!

459
00:30:09.633 --> 00:30:10.633
When I play games,

460
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:12.383
map knowledge is very important.

461
00:30:12.716 --> 00:30:14.133
We have to know where we can hide,

462
00:30:14.383 --> 00:30:15.425
where to power up,

463
00:30:15.591 --> 00:30:16.591
where's the ammunition,

464
00:30:16.841 --> 00:30:17.883
and where's the weapon...

465
00:30:18.008 --> 00:30:19.175
Where's your weapon?

466
00:30:25.175 --> 00:30:26.175
What are you doing?

467
00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:44.591
What are we doing here?

468
00:30:44.883 --> 00:30:46.050
To look for my rifle.

469
00:30:46.508 --> 00:30:48.133
You better not lose your weapon,

470
00:30:48.383 --> 00:30:49.423
or else I will charge you.

471
00:30:49.675 --> 00:30:50.800
I will find it.

472
00:30:51.383 --> 00:30:52.823
This is the shortcut to the canteen.

473
00:30:53.383 --> 00:30:54.091
Okay.

474
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.091
Line formation, tactical movement.

475
00:30:57.216 --> 00:30:58.216
Follow my command.

476
00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:01.758
What's he saying?

477
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.400
He's just putting on a show. Ignore him.

478
00:31:05.383 --> 00:31:07.758
Corporal, straight ahead, 20 metres!

479
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:09.841
We can see it.

480
00:31:10.883 --> 00:31:13.300
Keep quiet.
I thought you told us to be tactical.


481
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:18.591
That's weird.

482
00:31:19.133 --> 00:31:21.216
They are still following
their everyday routine.


483
00:31:21.675 --> 00:31:23.734
Why are they still patrolling
after becoming infected?


484
00:31:23.758 --> 00:31:24.758
What are you saying?

485
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:26.550
I'm saying, they still remember

486
00:31:26.675 --> 00:31:28.026
the patrolling route
after turning infected.


487
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.633
Their brains have been programmed.

488
00:31:31.133 --> 00:31:32.175
It's muscle memory.

489
00:31:36.675 --> 00:31:37.675
Oh shit!

490
00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:20.758
Quick, take his magazine!

491
00:32:21.008 --> 00:32:21.591
What magazine?

492
00:32:21.716 --> 00:32:23.216
The magazine that holds bullets!

493
00:32:23.758 --> 00:32:24.758
Corporal!

494
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.050
Okay!

495
00:32:30.466 --> 00:32:31.091
I got the magazine!

496
00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:32.216
Load the weapon!

497
00:32:32.758 --> 00:32:33.758
OK

498
00:32:35.341 --> 00:32:36.800
Weapon loaded!

499
00:32:37.383 --> 00:32:38.425
Fire weapon!

500
00:32:42.216 --> 00:32:44.175
Weapon malfunction!

501
00:32:49.383 --> 00:32:50.383
Give me the rifle!

502
00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.850
You misfired?
You will get detention for that!


503
00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.248
You didn't service your weapon!

504
00:32:58.508 --> 00:32:59.966
Run!

505
00:33:14.425 --> 00:33:16.300
Run! Kayu! Run faster!

506
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.300
Corporal.

507
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.310
They are queueing up
for the obstacle course.


508
00:33:24.091 --> 00:33:25.091
Muscle memory.

509
00:33:26.758 --> 00:33:27.466
Follow me.

510
00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:28.776
Let's clear the obstacle course, now!

511
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800
Go!

512
00:33:34.133 --> 00:33:36.216
They will be following us,
we can shake them off!


513
00:34:03.133 --> 00:34:03.966
Corporal, hurry up!

514
00:34:04.091 --> 00:34:05.611
You are not in basic training anymore!

515
00:34:09.925 --> 00:34:10.925
Quick!

516
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:12.966
Corporal! Don't be lazy!

517
00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:22.008
Hurry up! They're stuck!

518
00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:31.841
Hurry! Here they come!

519
00:35:01.925 --> 00:35:03.965
The front door is locked,
let's go to the back door.


520
00:35:06.175 --> 00:35:07.175
Mom!

521
00:35:08.966 --> 00:35:10.067
I know you can run very fast,

522
00:35:10.091 --> 00:35:11.841
but not everybody is
as fast as you are.

523
00:35:12.633 --> 00:35:13.633
Mom?

524
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:16.258
My girl!

525
00:35:16.383 --> 00:35:17.383
It's open.

526
00:35:19.425 --> 00:35:21.841
Hey, come in!

527
00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:25.758
Are you alright?

528
00:35:25.841 --> 00:35:26.841
Come on!

529
00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:28.133
Come in Kayu, quick!

530
00:35:29.508 --> 00:35:30.258
Sergeant!

531
00:35:30.383 --> 00:35:31.383
Susie.

532
00:35:31.758 --> 00:35:32.466
Sir.

533
00:35:32.633 --> 00:35:33.633
Hey!

534
00:35:38.466 --> 00:35:39.466
Private!

535
00:35:40.133 --> 00:35:41.216
Chua, close the gate!

536
00:35:41.591 --> 00:35:42.925
Hurry up, close the gate!

537
00:35:47.133 --> 00:35:48.175
Are you okay?

538
00:35:57.341 --> 00:35:58.341
Private...

539
00:35:59.008 --> 00:36:00.883
Wait, I'm ok!

540
00:36:04.633 --> 00:36:05.633
Shit!

541
00:36:05.841 --> 00:36:06.841
Private!

542
00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:09.966
Don't move.

543
00:36:11.425 --> 00:36:13.133
Chua, what are you doing?

544
00:36:13.633 --> 00:36:14.258
Take it easy.

545
00:36:14.383 --> 00:36:15.758
How can I take it easy!

546
00:36:17.466 --> 00:36:18.591
He's going to change.

547
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:21.591
Sir...

548
00:36:29.258 --> 00:36:31.050
Sir, help him!

549
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.800
Move!

550
00:36:40.966 --> 00:36:41.966
Inside!

551
00:36:51.133 --> 00:36:52.133
Hey!

552
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.550
Don't try to be a hero.

553
00:36:55.008 --> 00:36:56.008
Okay, okay.

554
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.300
You...

555
00:37:04.633 --> 00:37:05.633
She's also been bitten!

556
00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:09.175
Hey, calm down!

557
00:37:09.466 --> 00:37:10.466
I'm not bitten!

558
00:37:10.675 --> 00:37:11.883
Sir, she's not infected.

559
00:37:12.008 --> 00:37:13.008
It's an open wound.

560
00:37:13.216 --> 00:37:15.925
Any exposed wound
and contact with blood, dangerous.


561
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.341
No, she's fine!

562
00:37:17.466 --> 00:37:18.826
You think, I thought, who confirm?

563
00:37:19.841 --> 00:37:22.300
Look, we don't know anything
about this virus.


564
00:37:22.425 --> 00:37:23.942
Different people react to it differently.

565
00:37:23.966 --> 00:37:26.425
Some turn very quickly,
some take a lot longer.


566
00:37:26.633 --> 00:37:27.776
You shouldn't have come here!

567
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.008
I'm not bitten!

568
00:37:29.133 --> 00:37:30.151
You shouldn't have come here!

569
00:37:30.175 --> 00:37:30.925
Look at what's happening now!

570
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.442
He has been bitten and shot,
and now all of us are going to die.


571
00:37:33.466 --> 00:37:35.425
Hey, that's enough!

572
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.067
We have already said,
I'm not infected at all.


573
00:37:37.091 --> 00:37:38.171
What's the matter with you?

574
00:37:52.425 --> 00:37:53.800
Chua, sir,

575
00:37:55.216 --> 00:37:56.300
he will change soon.

576
00:38:02.841 --> 00:38:04.883
Sir, for your own safety

577
00:38:05.591 --> 00:38:06.883
we should lock all of them up.

578
00:38:08.675 --> 00:38:09.716
I have the gun now,

579
00:38:10.966 --> 00:38:11.966
we can head to your car.

580
00:38:14.758 --> 00:38:15.758
Okay.

581
00:38:16.175 --> 00:38:19.133
Buddy, come with us.

582
00:38:29.758 --> 00:38:30.800
Let me out!

583
00:38:30.925 --> 00:38:31.425
Corporal!

584
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.216
My daughter is fine, please let her out!

585
00:38:33.341 --> 00:38:34.591
Stupid Kayu, hey!

586
00:38:35.258 --> 00:38:36.050
Open the door!

587
00:38:36.175 --> 00:38:38.050
You son of a...
Let us out!


588
00:38:38.425 --> 00:38:39.091
Chua.

589
00:38:39.216 --> 00:38:40.341
You scum!

590
00:38:40.758 --> 00:38:42.591
She's fine, please let her out!

591
00:38:42.716 --> 00:38:44.633
Chua, well done.

592
00:38:45.216 --> 00:38:47.841
If we don't malinger,
we will not have freedom.


593
00:38:47.966 --> 00:38:48.716
Kayu...

594
00:38:48.925 --> 00:38:49.591
Damn it!

595
00:38:49.716 --> 00:38:50.716
Kayu.

596
00:38:52.341 --> 00:38:53.341
Mom!

597
00:38:53.925 --> 00:38:54.925
Hey!

598
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:57.758
Right now, our priority
is to ensure Captain Yap escapes safely.


599
00:38:57.925 --> 00:38:58.425
Understand?

600
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:59.550
If you are so important,

601
00:38:59.633 --> 00:39:01.716
why don't you wait for backup
to come rescue you?


602
00:39:01.925 --> 00:39:02.925
Open the door!

603
00:39:02.966 --> 00:39:04.591
Don't you come near me.

604
00:39:04.716 --> 00:39:06.116
Landlines can only call internally.

605
00:39:06.175 --> 00:39:07.508
Who approved this stupid policy?

606
00:39:07.633 --> 00:39:08.758
Thanks to Sergeant Lee,

607
00:39:09.133 --> 00:39:10.317
who confiscated all our mobile phones.

608
00:39:10.341 --> 00:39:12.758
And nobody is answering the phone
in the ops room.


609
00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:13.633
Why is nobody answering it?

610
00:39:13.758 --> 00:39:14.758
Sir.

611
00:39:17.008 --> 00:39:18.175
Standby your car keys.

612
00:39:19.675 --> 00:39:20.675
Yes.

613
00:39:36.883 --> 00:39:38.216
This place is so deserted.

614
00:39:38.633 --> 00:39:40.359
By the time anyone knows
what happened to us,


615
00:39:40.383 --> 00:39:41.508
we'll already be dead.

616
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.050
He's putting on a show.

617
00:39:53.175 --> 00:39:54.175
Chua.

618
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.050
Distract them.

619
00:40:28.008 --> 00:40:28.675
Mom!

620
00:40:28.966 --> 00:40:29.966
Girl!

621
00:40:30.883 --> 00:40:32.258
Please let my daughter out!

622
00:40:32.383 --> 00:40:33.383
Mom!

623
00:40:34.508 --> 00:40:35.508
Girl!

624
00:40:35.841 --> 00:40:37.216
Let her go!

625
00:40:37.383 --> 00:40:38.966
Let me out!

626
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.966
Sir, give me your car key now.

627
00:40:43.341 --> 00:40:44.341
Car key!

628
00:40:44.425 --> 00:40:45.425
What are you doing?

629
00:40:46.716 --> 00:40:48.800
My daughter is fine, please let her out!

630
00:40:49.091 --> 00:40:50.091
Girl!

631
00:40:51.091 --> 00:40:52.091
Girl!

632
00:40:55.341 --> 00:40:56.633
Chua.

633
00:40:58.175 --> 00:41:01.925
Chua! Don't shoot!

634
00:41:04.841 --> 00:41:06.258
Buddy, are you crazy?

635
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.925
You better think twice!

636
00:41:42.675 --> 00:41:43.216
Chua.

637
00:41:43.341 --> 00:41:44.341
Chua!

638
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.800
Buddy.

639
00:41:52.466 --> 00:41:53.866
Let's see who you want to save now.

640
00:41:55.425 --> 00:41:56.425
Chua!

641
00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.800
I'm sorry.

642
00:42:09.258 --> 00:42:10.716
Corporal! Shuttle run!

643
00:42:26.883 --> 00:42:29.091
Corporal! Even your mother
can run faster than you!


644
00:42:30.341 --> 00:42:33.341
Kayu, hurry up!

645
00:42:33.716 --> 00:42:34.716
Quick!

646
00:42:34.883 --> 00:42:36.466
Hurry!

647
00:42:40.258 --> 00:42:41.258
Quick!

648
00:42:48.383 --> 00:42:50.341
Would you stop mentioning my mother!

649
00:42:50.466 --> 00:42:51.466
Were you going to save us

650
00:42:51.508 --> 00:42:52.300
or you're just trying to save yourself?

651
00:42:52.425 --> 00:42:53.901
If I wanted to save myself
I would've escaped with them!


652
00:42:53.925 --> 00:42:55.050
Stop!

653
00:43:01.675 --> 00:43:03.258
Why wouldn't they bite you?

654
00:43:04.341 --> 00:43:05.701
Maybe they will not bite beauties.

655
00:43:06.633 --> 00:43:08.050
Susie, give it a try.

656
00:43:08.175 --> 00:43:09.175
Hey!

657
00:43:09.425 --> 00:43:10.591
Stop messing around!

658
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:14.841
We're finished.

659
00:43:16.508 --> 00:43:17.966
Oh heavens please save us.

660
00:43:18.216 --> 00:43:21.175
Sergeant, where's your father?
Where is RSM Lee?


661
00:43:21.508 --> 00:43:22.508
He has booked out.

662
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.425
I wish he was here.

663
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:25.841
He would be able to rescue us.

664
00:43:26.216 --> 00:43:28.466
What's their nickname for me in the past?

665
00:43:29.508 --> 00:43:30.300
Mad Dog Lee, sir!

666
00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:31.050
Yes!

667
00:43:31.425 --> 00:43:32.716
If I'm Mad Dog Lee,

668
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:34.925
make sure you are not Pussy Lee!

669
00:43:35.758 --> 00:43:38.050
What are you guys doing?

670
00:43:38.175 --> 00:43:39.425
Find a way out!

671
00:44:11.508 --> 00:44:12.508
Corporal,

672
00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:14.091
it's flag lowering time.

673
00:44:14.383 --> 00:44:16.263
The ops room will play
the anthem automatically.


674
00:44:16.716 --> 00:44:17.956
They are standing at attention!

675
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.841
Anthem?

676
00:44:18.966 --> 00:44:20.008
Muscle memory.

677
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.966
Girl, be careful. Stay closer.

678
00:44:36.258 --> 00:44:37.258
Is your arm alright?

679
00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:38.883
I'm fine!

680
00:44:41.175 --> 00:44:42.258
Let's go to the main gate.

681
00:44:46.925 --> 00:44:47.925
Oh my god

682
00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.966
Damn it. It's Captain Yap's car.

683
00:44:54.466 --> 00:44:55.466
They crashed.

684
00:45:05.216 --> 00:45:06.716
Where is Chua?

685
00:45:35.633 --> 00:45:36.758
Quick!

686
00:45:36.883 --> 00:45:37.883
Yes, sir

687
00:45:45.966 --> 00:45:47.508
The crazies are awake!

688
00:45:50.216 --> 00:45:51.216
Shit!

689
00:45:52.383 --> 00:45:53.383
Quick!

690
00:46:35.425 --> 00:46:36.425
Tazan?

691
00:46:47.341 --> 00:46:48.383
Section, fall back!

692
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.341
Go!

693
00:46:49.508 --> 00:46:50.508
Run

694
00:47:09.216 --> 00:47:09.841
What were you doing?

695
00:47:09.966 --> 00:47:11.166
So tired that you can't think?

696
00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.008
Mom, you'll be fine!

697
00:47:16.841 --> 00:47:17.925
You will be fine!

698
00:47:19.675 --> 00:47:23.383
I thought they wouldn't bite beauties.

699
00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:26.425
Mom...

700
00:47:29.258 --> 00:47:31.925
Girl, I'll be ok.

701
00:47:33.591 --> 00:47:35.050
Aren't you very fit and tough?

702
00:47:35.466 --> 00:47:36.883
Why didn't you save my mom?

703
00:47:37.675 --> 00:47:39.841
Mom, why did you rescue that jerk?

704
00:47:40.716 --> 00:47:41.716
Girl,

705
00:47:41.883 --> 00:47:45.550
in life we shouldn't just
think about ourselves.


706
00:47:51.841 --> 00:47:53.383
You must escape from here.

707
00:47:53.508 --> 00:47:55.008
Come with us....

708
00:47:55.508 --> 00:47:56.716
Let's leave together.

709
00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:07.133
You must bring her.

710
00:48:08.216 --> 00:48:09.216
Bring her...

711
00:48:09.425 --> 00:48:10.425
Bring her out to safety.

712
00:48:16.425 --> 00:48:17.425
Mom.

713
00:48:20.758 --> 00:48:22.175
What the hell are you doing?

714
00:48:22.425 --> 00:48:23.883
You better wake up, understand?

715
00:48:24.133 --> 00:48:25.300
Do you want to be charged?

716
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:28.383
Not everyone is as tough as you!

717
00:48:28.758 --> 00:48:30.508
That's why we must help them!

718
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.591
Tazan and I are only here for reservist!

719
00:48:33.091 --> 00:48:34.859
You only know how to
escape your responsibilities!


720
00:48:34.883 --> 00:48:35.984
We must follow the protocol!

721
00:48:36.008 --> 00:48:37.128
You keep following protocol,

722
00:48:37.216 --> 00:48:38.633
but we are still trapped here!

723
00:48:38.758 --> 00:48:40.758
Stop!

724
00:48:42.341 --> 00:48:44.008
Why can't you stop fighting...

725
00:48:44.258 --> 00:48:46.216
Why didn't you save my mom?

726
00:48:47.675 --> 00:48:49.841
One of you is a lazy coward,

727
00:48:50.925 --> 00:48:54.508
and the other is just an arrogant
and selfish bully,


728
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.425
forcing people to follow your order!

729
00:48:57.716 --> 00:48:58.925
You guys are soldiers,

730
00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:00.591
but you can't even fire a gun.

731
00:49:01.508 --> 00:49:02.508
If you can't save us,

732
00:49:02.591 --> 00:49:04.216
who is going to save us?

733
00:49:10.758 --> 00:49:11.758
Mom!

734
00:49:13.133 --> 00:49:14.133
Mom!

735
00:49:16.091 --> 00:49:17.091
Mom!

736
00:49:19.508 --> 00:49:20.508
Mom...

737
00:49:30.133 --> 00:49:31.133
Go!

738
00:49:32.216 --> 00:49:33.216
Let's go!

739
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:09.591
Mom...

740
00:50:11.883 --> 00:50:12.883
Mom...

741
00:53:10.091 --> 00:53:12.171
Every time I feign illness
or evade responsibilities,


742
00:53:12.466 --> 00:53:13.706
I've caused trouble for others.

743
00:53:14.508 --> 00:53:15.716
Instead of facing my problems,

744
00:53:15.883 --> 00:53:17.403
I always try to
find the easy way out.

745
00:53:19.758 --> 00:53:22.216
I was the one who dragged Tazan
to report sick with me.


746
00:53:23.341 --> 00:53:24.692
When he got infected at the medical centre,

747
00:53:24.716 --> 00:53:25.716
it was my fault.

748
00:53:28.091 --> 00:53:30.591
And now...

749
00:53:33.675 --> 00:53:35.508
I also don't deserve to be your commander.

750
00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:38.175
I'm good at nothing.

751
00:53:39.591 --> 00:53:40.966
I will never be as good as RSM.

752
00:53:43.633 --> 00:53:45.050
If we were to follow the protocol,

753
00:53:45.466 --> 00:53:47.466
we would have reached
the ops room at HQ block.


754
00:53:48.175 --> 00:53:49.258
There's a signal set there,

755
00:53:49.508 --> 00:53:50.966
we can contact the army HQ.

756
00:53:52.008 --> 00:53:53.568
I failed to achieve mission objectives.

757
00:53:55.091 --> 00:53:56.675
I was a duty
clerk in the ops room.

758
00:53:57.258 --> 00:53:58.898
The anthem can be broadcasted from there.

759
00:54:00.133 --> 00:54:01.453
When the crazies hear the anthem,

760
00:54:01.675 --> 00:54:02.383
they will be frozen.

761
00:54:02.508 --> 00:54:03.508
Muscle memory.

762
00:54:06.091 --> 00:54:08.508
But, how do we
get to the HQ block?

763
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.320
This camp is full of infected crazies.

764
00:54:14.133 --> 00:54:15.633
Why didn't the crazies bite you?

765
00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.716
The crazies didn't bite me
at the medical centre too.


766
00:54:43.508 --> 00:54:44.633
It's the mosquito repellent!

767
00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.425
We both had applied the repellent,

768
00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:50.841
that's why they didn't bite us.

769
00:54:51.175 --> 00:54:52.359
They can't smell us!
Our scent is camouflaged.


770
00:54:52.383 --> 00:54:53.508
Mosquito repellent?

771
00:54:53.675 --> 00:54:54.925
Are you kidding me?

772
00:55:07.175 --> 00:55:08.175
Shit.

773
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.008
Corporal, look for mosquito repellent!

774
00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.300
Hurry!

775
00:55:21.008 --> 00:55:22.258
Where is the ops room?

776
00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:25.050
HQ block, second storey, third door.

777
00:56:08.883 --> 00:56:10.550
Bloody hell, it's really out of stock.

778
00:56:10.758 --> 00:56:12.918
You can find everything here
except mosquito repellent.


779
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.800
Unless...

780
00:56:15.258 --> 00:56:17.018
we rub our bodies
against Beauty Xiao Ling's.


781
00:56:18.425 --> 00:56:19.133
How can we confirm that

782
00:56:19.258 --> 00:56:21.109
the repellent can mask our scent
from the crazies?


783
00:56:21.133 --> 00:56:22.133
We will have to test it.

784
00:56:23.841 --> 00:56:24.841
Where's Beauty?

785
00:56:31.383 --> 00:56:31.966
Xiao Ling!

786
00:56:32.091 --> 00:56:33.633
Where are you going with the rifle?

787
00:56:34.008 --> 00:56:35.008
Fall back now!

788
00:56:35.716 --> 00:56:36.925
You guys are useless.

789
00:56:37.508 --> 00:56:38.984
I will go play the
anthem at the ops room

790
00:56:39.008 --> 00:56:40.008
and then you can join me.

791
00:56:40.466 --> 00:56:41.966
But you are sweating already!

792
00:56:42.466 --> 00:56:45.091
Beauty, stop! This is an order!

793
00:56:49.883 --> 00:56:50.883
Helicopter...

794
00:56:51.675 --> 00:56:53.067
They really sent a helicopter here.

795
00:56:53.091 --> 00:56:54.466
Is it here to rescue Captain Yap?

796
00:56:55.008 --> 00:56:56.109
Senior Minister of Parliament,

797
00:56:56.133 --> 00:56:57.773
works in parliament, in charge of defence

798
00:56:58.091 --> 00:56:59.371
don't know what he does exactly.

799
00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:02.841
Corporal,

800
00:57:02.966 --> 00:57:04.401
there's a signal set in the ops room.

801
00:57:04.425 --> 00:57:06.185
Maybe we can communicate
with the helicopter.


802
00:57:06.508 --> 00:57:07.828
After Xiao Ling plays the anthem,

803
00:57:08.341 --> 00:57:10.925
we will join her at the ops room.

804
00:57:26.758 --> 00:57:29.008
Corporal, standby for mobilisation.

805
00:57:29.175 --> 00:57:30.966
Full battle order on, now!

806
00:59:10.133 --> 00:59:11.300
Follow my gaming tactics.

807
00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:12.383
When you encounter crazies.

808
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:13.383
don't be a hero.

809
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:14.609
If you can avoid them, that's the best.

810
00:59:14.633 --> 00:59:15.817
If you can't avoid them, hit them.

811
00:59:15.841 --> 00:59:17.241
If you can't defeat them, run away.

812
00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:21.550
Yes Corporal. Avoid, hit, and run!

813
00:59:21.966 --> 00:59:24.258
Operation Crazies, begin!

814
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.050
They are so outdated,

815
01:00:02.175 --> 01:00:03.716
still using CDs.

816
01:00:14.341 --> 01:00:15.508
Are you kidding me?

817
01:00:20.675 --> 01:00:21.675
What's that?

818
01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:35.550
Stupid crazies.

819
01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:37.925
Over to you, guys.

820
01:01:00.133 --> 01:01:01.133
Beauty.

821
01:01:05.466 --> 01:01:06.466
Chua...

822
01:01:15.341 --> 01:01:16.381
There are other survivors.

823
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.883
Why won't they bite you?

824
01:01:32.091 --> 01:01:33.091
Tell me.

825
01:01:35.508 --> 01:01:36.508
Hey!

826
01:01:37.758 --> 01:01:38.758
Shit

827
01:01:46.633 --> 01:01:47.633
What's going on?

828
01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:52.341
Contacted!

829
01:01:54.633 --> 01:01:56.300
Why won't they bite you?

830
01:02:09.508 --> 01:02:10.508
Black tape rocks.

831
01:02:16.925 --> 01:02:17.925
Xiao Ling!

832
01:02:18.091 --> 01:02:19.091
Stop fooling around!

833
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.300
Chua.

834
01:02:22.758 --> 01:02:23.925
That son of a mother!

835
01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:44.675
(HQ ops room, do you read me? Over.)

836
01:02:45.175 --> 01:02:46.466
(We are looking for survivors.)

837
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.466
(Is there a Medical Officer Captain Yap?)

838
01:02:49.508 --> 01:02:50.508
(HQ ops room?)

839
01:02:57.383 --> 01:02:59.425
This is Captain Yap speaking...

840
01:03:00.216 --> 01:03:01.508
(Captain Yap, sir!)

841
01:03:01.633 --> 01:03:03.383
(We have dispatched the rescue helicopter.)

842
01:03:03.591 --> 01:03:05.466
(Please standby at the Blue Bridge Gate.)

843
01:03:05.716 --> 01:03:07.401
(The area is clear for helicopter landing.)

844
01:03:07.425 --> 01:03:08.425
(Over.)

845
01:03:10.008 --> 01:03:11.008
Roger that.

846
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.050
Helicopter...

847
01:03:16.758 --> 01:03:19.550
Since you are immune,
you are coming with me to protect me.


848
01:03:22.383 --> 01:03:23.425
Come with me!

849
01:03:35.425 --> 01:03:37.216
Shit, use smoke bomb!

850
01:03:38.091 --> 01:03:39.091
Fire in the hole!

851
01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:05.508
Exercise cut.

852
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.758
Follow me, 12 o'clock!

853
01:04:10.008 --> 01:04:11.008
Go!

854
01:04:14.591 --> 01:04:15.591
Climb up!

855
01:04:17.508 --> 01:04:19.216
Hurry! They can't follow us!

856
01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:38.133
Climb it like the obstacle course!

857
01:05:04.383 --> 01:05:05.383
Shit!

858
01:05:21.008 --> 01:05:22.633
Don't grab my ass!

859
01:05:22.758 --> 01:05:23.800
They are pulling me!

860
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:25.883
Corporal, climb!

861
01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:29.550
If anything happens to me,

862
01:05:29.675 --> 01:05:30.966
you have to rescue Beauty!

863
01:05:31.216 --> 01:05:31.925
No!

864
01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:33.300
We'll rescue her together!

865
01:06:16.675 --> 01:06:18.008
If anything happens to me,

866
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:19.841
you have to rescue Xiao Ling!

867
01:06:20.675 --> 01:06:21.675
Corporal,

868
01:06:22.008 --> 01:06:23.448
you can't even complete one chin-up!

869
01:06:23.758 --> 01:06:25.883
Even your mother can do better than you!
Understand?


870
01:06:28.925 --> 01:06:31.300
Stop mentioning my mother!

871
01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.925
My mother has passed away.

872
01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800
Kayu...

873
01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:17.550
Sorry.

874
01:07:25.966 --> 01:07:27.591
Come, let's go get Xiao Ling.

875
01:07:36.925 --> 01:07:37.675
(Captain Yap,)

876
01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:40.216
(please get to the Blue Bridge Gate
right now, over.)


877
01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:42.091
Beauty...

878
01:08:00.341 --> 01:08:01.175
Hurry up! Even...

879
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.883
I can run faster than you!

880
01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:04.050
Nice!

881
01:08:28.383 --> 01:08:30.341
Chua, what are you doing?

882
01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:33.508
Get up!

883
01:08:40.383 --> 01:08:43.966
Buddy, I've contacted the helicopter.

884
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:53.841
Chua, listen to me.

885
01:08:54.175 --> 01:08:55.175
Stay away from me!

886
01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:58.175
Don't challenge my limit.

887
01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.216
Nobody's challenging you, okay?

888
01:09:01.925 --> 01:09:02.925
Chua.

889
01:09:07.216 --> 01:09:08.258
We can leave together.

890
01:09:09.425 --> 01:09:11.841
It doesn't have to be like this, okay?

891
01:09:15.383 --> 01:09:16.383
You think I'm dumb?

892
01:09:17.591 --> 01:09:18.591
Get up!

893
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.300
Buddy, I'm just like you.

894
01:09:24.091 --> 01:09:25.341
I just want to go home.

895
01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:28.008
My wife, my daughter...

896
01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:31.508
They are waiting for me!

897
01:09:31.925 --> 01:09:33.466
I understand, I really do...

898
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:34.633
You don't understand!

899
01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:36.800
And you!

900
01:09:36.925 --> 01:09:38.341
Why won't they bite you?

901
01:09:43.216 --> 01:09:44.800
Calm down, Chua!

902
01:09:48.758 --> 01:09:49.758
Why?

903
01:10:15.466 --> 01:10:16.883
Let me go!

904
01:10:19.633 --> 01:10:20.800
Don't test me!

905
01:10:32.008 --> 01:10:33.633
I said, stop testing my limit!

906
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:58.300
Don't make me shoot you!

907
01:10:58.425 --> 01:10:59.425
Five,

908
01:10:59.591 --> 01:11:00.591
four,

909
01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:01.425
three,

910
01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:02.550
two,

911
01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.800
one!

912
01:11:07.758 --> 01:11:08.425
The rifle

913
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:09.175
has only

914
01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.050
five

915
01:11:10.175 --> 01:11:11.175
bullets!

916
01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.300
Sergeant!

917
01:11:18.758 --> 01:11:19.758
Sergeant!

918
01:11:20.716 --> 01:11:21.716
Sergeant!

919
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:25.758
I thought we were buddies.

920
01:11:25.883 --> 01:11:27.341
I thought so too!

921
01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.258
You think, I thought, who confirm?

922
01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:36.300
You think, I thought, who confirm?

923
01:11:38.841 --> 01:11:39.841
Sergeant!

924
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:41.550
Sergeant!

925
01:12:00.925 --> 01:12:01.675
I'm fine.

926
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.133
Kayu! Sergeant is fine!

927
01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:12.008
Kayu, you slacker,

928
01:12:12.675 --> 01:12:13.425
if I can't escape from here,

929
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:14.550
neither can you guys!

930
01:12:15.216 --> 01:12:16.425
We can all die together!

931
01:13:34.716 --> 01:13:35.716
Kayu!

932
01:13:37.925 --> 01:13:38.925
Knock it down!

933
01:13:52.925 --> 01:13:54.633
Hurry up!

934
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:12.670
Where's the medical officer?

935
01:15:13.258 --> 01:15:14.300
Where's Captain Yap?

936
01:15:14.966 --> 01:15:16.925
I'm here for my son!

937
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:34.550
Xiao Ling.

938
01:15:44.841 --> 01:15:45.841
Sorry.

939
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:30.800
Sir!

940
01:16:33.383 --> 01:16:34.716
I couldn't save all our men.

941
01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:40.258
At least you're fine!

942
01:16:43.175 --> 01:16:44.175
Dad.

943
01:17:07.341 --> 01:17:09.800

951
01:17:31.216 --> 01:17:33.133
(Personnel with the codewords...)

952
01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:34.508
(Lucky Strike,)

953
01:17:34.758 --> 01:17:36.050
(Dead Meat,)

954
01:17:36.383 --> 01:17:37.466
(Out Break,)

955
01:17:37.841 --> 01:17:38.925
(Top Prize,)

956
01:17:39.133 --> 01:17:42.008
(please report to your
mobilisation centre now.)


957

(To acknowledge, press one.
To repeat...)


958
01:17:52.841 --> 01:17:53.508
Corporal.

959
01:17:53.633 --> 01:17:54.258
Sergeant.

960
01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:55.550
This is a real operation,

961
01:17:55.675 --> 01:17:56.466
not a lazy practice mission.

962
01:17:56.591 --> 01:17:57.175
Understand?

963
01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:57.966
Yes, sergeant.

964
01:17:58.091 --> 01:17:59.771
Even my grandmother
can do better than you.


965
01:18:00.591 --> 01:18:01.991
Why don't you ask grandmother here?

966
01:18:02.175 --> 01:18:03.317
Are you talking about my mom?

967
01:18:03.341 --> 01:18:04.341
RSM sir!

968
01:18:04.716 --> 01:18:06.776
Crawling through the battlefield
makes the grass dance!


969
01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.091
Not tactical at all!

970
01:18:08.841 --> 01:18:09.966
You better wake up!

971
01:18:10.091 --> 01:18:11.091
Yes sir.

972
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.300
Corporal,

973
01:18:12.633 --> 01:18:14.550
I heard you are excused from
using upper limbs,


974
01:18:14.675 --> 01:18:17.008
excused lower limbs, excused boots,

975
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:18.758
and you have back problems?

976
01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.300
Yes sir, but I've recovered already.

977
01:18:21.508 --> 01:18:22.508
Very good.

978
01:18:22.591 --> 01:18:24.466
After this mission, 
I will charge you!

979
01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:25.591
Hush.

980
01:18:25.966 --> 01:18:26.966
Sir, contacted!

981
01:18:30.966 --> 01:18:34.383
We are here to rescue all survivors.

982
01:18:34.758 --> 01:18:36.133
Leave no man behind!

983
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.925
That's it man!
